00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:29,878
I owe everything to George Bailey... 
Help him, dear Father.

3
00:01:29,878 --> 00:01:36,029
Joseph, Jesus and Mary. 
Help my friend, Mr. Bailey.

4
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,308
Help my son, George, tonight.

5
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:43,035
He never thinks about himself, God, 
that's why he's in trouble.

6
00:01:43,035 --> 00:01:47,571
George is a good guy. 
Give him a break, God...

7
00:01:47,571 --> 00:01:51,445
I love him, dear Lord. 
Watch over him tonight...

8
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:55,169
Please, God, 
something's the matter with Daddy...

9
00:01:55,169 --> 00:01:59,739
Please bring Daddy back.

10
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,509
Hello, Joseph. 
Trouble?

11
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:13,222
Looks like we'll have to 
send someone down.

12
00:02:13,222 --> 00:02:16,584
A lot of people asking for help 
for a man named  George Bailey.

13
00:02:16,584 --> 00:02:20,572
George Bailey. Yes. 
Tonight's his crucial night. You're right.

14
00:02:20,572 --> 00:02:23,638
We'll have to send someone down 
immediately. Whose turn is it?

15
00:02:23,638 --> 00:02:26,345
That's why I came to see you, sir.

16
00:02:26,345 --> 00:02:28,625
It's that clock-maker's turn again.

17
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:31,921
Oh, Clarence. 
Hasn't got his wings yet, has he?

18
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:34,097
We've passed him up right along.

19
00:02:34,097 --> 00:02:37,377
Because, you know, sir, he's got 
the I.Q. of a rabbit.

20
00:02:37,377 --> 00:02:41,102
Yes, but he's got the faith of a child. Simple.

21
00:02:41,102 --> 00:02:43,257
Joseph, send for Clarence.

22
00:02:46,673 --> 00:02:47,721
You sent for me, sir?

23
00:02:47,721 --> 00:02:50,996
Yes, Clarence. 
A man down on earth needs our help.

24
00:02:50,996 --> 00:02:52,490
Splendid! Is he sick?

25
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,801
No. Worse. He's discouraged.

26
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:57,718
At exactly ten forty-five P.M., earth-time,

27
00:02:57,718 --> 00:03:01,576
that man will be thinking seriously 
of throwing away God's greatest gift.

28
00:03:01,576 --> 00:03:05,656
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I have 
only an hour to dress.

29
00:03:05,656 --> 00:03:06,669
What are they wearing now?

30
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:10,037
You will spend that hour getting 
acquainted with George Bailey.

31
00:03:10,037 --> 00:03:16,543
Sir...If I should accomplish this mission...
I mean, uh, might I perhaps win my wings?

32
00:03:16,543 --> 00:03:19,060
I've been waiting for over 
two hundred years now, sir...

33
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,774
and people are beginniing to talk.

34
00:03:20,774 --> 00:03:22,094
What's that book you've got there?

35
00:03:22,094 --> 00:03:24,573
Oh, 'The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.'

36
00:03:24,573 --> 00:03:28,138
Clarence, you do a good job with 
George Bailey and you'll get your wings.

37
00:03:28,138 --> 00:03:30,245
Oh, thank you, sir. 
Thank you.

38
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:32,977
Poor George. Sit down.

39
00:03:32,977 --> 00:03:34,451
Sit down?! What are we...

40
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:38,498
If you're going to help a man, you want 
to know something about him, don't you?

41
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:42,322
- Well, naturally, of course, I...
- Well, keep your eyes open.

42
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:46,179
- See the town?
- Where? I...I don't see a thing.

43
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:49,245
Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet.

44
00:03:49,245 --> 00:03:51,145
Now look, I'll help 
you out.

45
00:03:51,145 --> 00:03:52,996
Concentrate.

46
00:03:52,996 --> 00:03:54,675
Begin to see something?

47
00:03:54,675 --> 00:03:57,478
Why, yes! 
This is amazing!

48
00:03:57,478 --> 00:04:00,109
If you ever get your wings, 
you'll see all by yourself.

49
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:01,940
Oh, wonderful!

50
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,851
Yippee!

51
00:04:04,851 --> 00:04:07,434
Okay, boys, let's go.

52
00:04:07,434 --> 00:04:08,567
Hey, who's that?

53
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:11,482
- That's your problem, George Bailey.
- A boy?!

54
00:04:11,482 --> 00:04:14,768
That's him when he was twelve. 
Back in nineteen nineteen.

55
00:04:14,768 --> 00:04:18,137
Something happens here 
you'll have to remember later on.

56
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:25,058
Come on, Marty. 
Come on, Marty.

57
00:04:26,074 --> 00:04:30,205
- Hee-haw!
- Hee-haw!

58
00:04:30,205 --> 00:04:34,575
And here comes the scare-baby, 
my kid brother, Harry Bailey!

59
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:36,653
I'm not scared!

60
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,627
Go, Harry! C'mon, Harry! 
Attaboy, Harry! Come on, Harry!

61
00:04:46,402 --> 00:04:49,992
Help, George! 
Help! Help!

62
00:04:49,992 --> 00:04:52,757
...Harry, I'm coming!

63
00:04:52,757 --> 00:04:55,181
- Help!
- Hang on, Harry!

64
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:57,635
I'm coming! 
Chain Gang!

65
00:04:57,635 --> 00:05:00,749
George saved his brother's life that day.

66
00:05:00,749 --> 00:05:04,394
But it caught him that cold 
which infected his left ear.

67
00:05:04,394 --> 00:05:06,813
Cost him his hearing in that ear.

68
00:05:06,813 --> 00:05:10,476
It was weeks before he was able to 
go back to his after-school job

69
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,244
at old man Gower's Drugstore.

70
00:05:13,244 --> 00:05:14,633
Mr. Potter!

71
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:16,822
Who's that? 
A king?

72
00:05:16,822 --> 00:05:19,014
That's Henry F. Potter.

73
00:05:19,014 --> 00:05:22,519
The richest and meanest man 
in the county.

74
00:05:26,313 --> 00:05:35,736
Hee-haw! Hee-haw! 
Go to work, slave...

75
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:43,389
I wish I had a million dollars! 
Hot dog!

76
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:45,393
It's me, Mr. Gower. 
George Bailey.

77
00:05:45,393 --> 00:05:47,559
- You're late
- Yes, sir.

78
00:05:56,107 --> 00:05:59,613
Hello, George. 
Hello, Mary.

79
00:05:59,613 --> 00:06:00,899
Hello, Violet.

80
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:02,390
Two-cents' worth of shoelaces?

81
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,865
She was here first.

82
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:05,821
I'm still thinking.

83
00:06:05,821 --> 00:06:06,846
Shoelaces?

84
00:06:06,846 --> 00:06:10,481
Please, Georgie. 
I like him.

85
00:06:10,481 --> 00:06:12,264
You like every boy.

86
00:06:12,264 --> 00:06:14,195
What's wrong with that?

87
00:06:14,195 --> 00:06:16,403
Here you are.

88
00:06:16,403 --> 00:06:19,137
- Help me down.
- Help you down?!

89
00:06:26,188 --> 00:06:27,987
Made up your mind yet?

90
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,837
I'll take chocolate.

91
00:06:29,837 --> 00:06:31,054
With coconuts?

92
00:06:31,054 --> 00:06:32,887
I don't like coconuts.

93
00:06:32,887 --> 00:06:34,831
You don't like coconuts?

94
00:06:34,831 --> 00:06:38,777
Say, brainless, don't you know 
where coconuts come from?

95
00:06:38,777 --> 00:06:43,640
Look it here...
from Tahiti, Fiji Islands, the Coral Sea!

96
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,749
A new magazine! 
I never saw it before.

97
00:06:46,749 --> 00:06:48,035
Of course you never.

98
00:06:48,035 --> 00:06:50,071
Only us explorers can get it.

99
00:06:50,071 --> 00:06:55,174
I've been nominated for membership 
in the National Geographic Society.

100
00:06:55,174 --> 00:06:58,012
Is this the ear you can't hear on?

101
00:06:58,012 --> 00:07:01,495
George Bailey, 
I'll love you till the day I die.

102
00:07:01,495 --> 00:07:04,421
I'm going out exploring some day, 
you watch.

103
00:07:04,421 --> 00:07:07,961
And I'm gonna have a couple of harems, 
and maybe three or four wives.

104
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,314
Wait and see.

105
00:07:12,068 --> 00:07:15,270
- George! George!
- Yes, sir.

106
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,327
You're not paid to be a canary.

107
00:07:18,327 --> 00:07:19,690
No, sir...

108
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,084
Mr. Gower, do you want something?

109
00:07:49,084 --> 00:07:51,670
- Anything?
- No.

110
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:54,943
- Anything I can do back here?
- Nope.

111
00:07:54,943 --> 00:07:56,333
I'll get them, sir.

112
00:07:56,333 --> 00:08:00,695
...take those capsules 
over to Mrs. Blaine's.

113
00:08:00,695 --> 00:08:02,822
- She's waiting for them.
- Yes, sir...

114
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:28,044
They have the diphtheria there, 
haven't they, sir?

115
00:08:28,044 --> 00:08:29,194
Ummm.

116
00:08:29,194 --> 00:08:31,043
Is it a charge, sir?

117
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:33,130
Yes, charge.

118
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,677
- Mr. Gower, I think...
- Aw, get going!

119
00:08:35,677 --> 00:08:36,882
Yes, sir.

120
00:09:03,403 --> 00:09:05,365
Fast there, Captain Cook! 
Where you headin'?

121
00:09:05,365 --> 00:09:06,642
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.

122
00:09:06,642 --> 00:09:08,663
- Some other time, George.
- It's important!

123
00:09:08,663 --> 00:09:11,353
There's a squall in there 
that's shapin' up into a storm.

124
00:09:11,353 --> 00:09:12,725
Uncle Billy, telephone.

125
00:09:12,725 --> 00:09:14,854
- Who is it?
- The Bank examiner.

126
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,352
Bank examiner?

127
00:09:16,352 --> 00:09:18,576
Oh, I should have called him yesterday.

128
00:09:18,576 --> 00:09:20,140
Switch it inside.

129
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:21,980
&nbsp;

130
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,625
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.

131
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,491
Well, you're begging 
and that's a whole lot worse.

132
00:09:25,491 --> 00:09:27,562
All I'm asking for 
is thirty days more.

133
00:09:27,562 --> 00:09:28,663
- Pop!
- Just a minute, son.

134
00:09:28,663 --> 00:09:31,517
Just thirty short days. I'll dig up 
that five thousand somehow.

135
00:09:31,517 --> 00:09:33,210
- Shove me up. Shove me up.
- Pop!

136
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:37,480
Have you put any real pressure on these 
people of yours to pay those mortgages?

137
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,909
Times are bad, Mr. Potter. 
A lot of these people are out of work.

138
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:41,838
- Then foreclose!
- I can't do that.

139
00:09:41,838 --> 00:09:43,278
- These families have children.
- Pop!

140
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:44,469
They're not my children.

141
00:09:44,469 --> 00:09:46,370
But they're somebody's children, Mr. Potter.

142
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,035
Are you running a business or a charity ward?

143
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:51,275
- Well, all right...
- Not with my money.

144
00:09:51,275 --> 00:09:53,923
Mr. Potter, what makes you such a 
hard-skulled character?

145
00:09:53,923 --> 00:09:55,806
You have no family, no children.

146
00:09:55,806 --> 00:09:57,784
You can't begin to spend all the 
money you've got.

147
00:09:57,784 --> 00:10:01,646
So I suppose I should give it to miserable 
failures like you

148
00:10:01,646 --> 00:10:04,350
and that idiot brother of yours 
to spend for me.

149
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,793
He's not a failure!

150
00:10:05,793 --> 00:10:08,100
- You can't say that about my father!
- George, George, quiet. George, George...

151
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,840
You're not! 
You're the biggest man in town!

152
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,036
- Run along.
- Bigger than him.

153
00:10:11,036 --> 00:10:12,356
- Run along!
- Bigger than everybody!

154
00:10:12,356 --> 00:10:13,862
Gives you an idea of the Baileys.

155
00:10:13,862 --> 00:10:15,733
Don't let him say things like that 
about you, Pop.

156
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:16,778
All right, son. 
All right.

157
00:10:16,778 --> 00:10:18,932
Thanks. 
I'll talk to you tonight.

158
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:27,857
What!

159
00:10:27,857 --> 00:10:31,572
Why, that medicine should have been 
there an hour ago.

160
00:10:31,572 --> 00:10:34,369
It'll be over in five minutes, Mrs. Blaine.

161
00:10:38,043 --> 00:10:40,414
Where's Mrs. Blaine's box of capsules?

162
00:10:40,414 --> 00:10:42,202
I feel...

163
00:10:42,927 --> 00:10:45,237
- Didn't you hear what I said?
- Yes, sir, I...

164
00:10:45,237 --> 00:10:47,661
What kind of tricks are you playing anyway?

165
00:10:49,444 --> 00:10:52,832
Why didn't you deliver them right away?

166
00:10:52,832 --> 00:10:54,209
Don't you know that boy's very sick?

167
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:55,906
You're hurting my sore ear.

168
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:57,466
You lazy loafer!

169
00:10:57,466 --> 00:10:59,781
Mr. Gower, you don't know what you're doing.

170
00:10:59,781 --> 00:11:01,579
You put something wrong in those capsules.

171
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:02,969
I know you're unhappy.

172
00:11:02,969 --> 00:11:04,732
You got that telegram and you're upset.

173
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:06,583
You put something bad in those capsules.

174
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,461
It wasn't your fault, Mr. Gower.

175
00:11:10,192 --> 00:11:11,838
Just look and see what you did.

176
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,329
Look at the bottle you took the powder from.

177
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:16,088
It's poison! 
I tell you it's poison!

178
00:11:16,088 --> 00:11:18,123
I know you feel bad.

179
00:11:18,123 --> 00:11:19,125
I didn't know...

180
00:11:23,137 --> 00:11:24,893
- Oh...
- Don't hurt my sore ear again.

181
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,219
- Don't hurt my sore ear again.
- Oh, no, no, no...

182
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:29,290
Oh, George. George...

183
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,030
Oh, Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone.

184
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,537
I know what you're feeling.

185
00:11:33,537 --> 00:11:35,029
I won't tell a soul.

186
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:38,205
- Hope to die, I won't.
- Oh, George, George...

187
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:41,022
An overnight bag, 
genuine English cowhide,

188
00:11:41,022 --> 00:11:43,204
combination lock, 
fitted up with brushes, combs...

189
00:11:43,204 --> 00:11:45,753
Nope! 
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

190
00:11:45,753 --> 00:11:48,201
Now look, Joe. 
Now look,

191
00:11:48,201 --> 00:11:51,054
I, I-I want a big one.

192
00:11:51,054 --> 00:11:52,273
What did you stop it for?

193
00:11:52,273 --> 00:11:55,717
I want you to take a good look at that face.

194
00:11:55,717 --> 00:11:57,752
- Who is it?
- George Bailey.

195
00:11:57,752 --> 00:12:01,029
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears 
slapped back by the druggist?

196
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:02,692
That's the kid.

197
00:12:02,692 --> 00:12:05,381
Uh-huh. It's a good face.

198
00:12:05,381 --> 00:12:08,903
I like it. 
I like George Bailey.

199
00:12:08,903 --> 00:12:11,414
Tell me, did he ever tell anyone 
about the pills?

200
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:12,940
Not a soul.

201
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,759
Did he ever marry the girl? 
Did he ever go exploring?

202
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:18,270
Well, wait and see.

203
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,308
Big...see...
I, I don't want one for one night.

204
00:12:20,308 --> 00:12:22,519
I want something for a thousand 
and one nights.

205
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:27,069
With plenty of room here for labels 
from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand...

206
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:28,257
a great big one.

207
00:12:28,257 --> 00:12:30,201
- I see, a flying carpet, huh?
- Yeah.

208
00:12:30,201 --> 00:12:33,043
I don't suppose you'd like 
this old second-hand job, would you?

209
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,336
Now you're talking.

210
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,302
Gee whiz, I could use that 
as a raft in case the boat sunk.

211
00:12:37,302 --> 00:12:40,257
- How much does this cost?
- No charge.

212
00:12:40,257 --> 00:12:42,582
That's my trick ear, Joe. 
It sounded as if you said no charge.

213
00:12:42,582 --> 00:12:43,610
That's right.

214
00:12:44,783 --> 00:12:46,395
Well, what's my name doing on it here?

215
00:12:46,395 --> 00:12:49,206
A little present form old man Gower. 
Came down and picked it out himself.

216
00:12:49,206 --> 00:12:50,249
He did?!

217
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:53,179
What do you know about that...
my old boss. Isn't that nice?

218
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:54,228
What boat you sailing on?

219
00:12:54,228 --> 00:12:55,875
I'm working across on a cattle boat.

220
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,249
- A cattle boat?
- Okay, I like cows.

221
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:02,129
- Hello, Mr. Gower.
- George!

222
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:04,054
How are you? 
Thanks ever so much for the baggage.

223
00:13:04,054 --> 00:13:05,353
- It's just exactly what I wanted.
- Aw, forget it.

224
00:13:05,353 --> 00:13:06,764
Oh, it's wonderful of you to think of it.

225
00:13:06,764 --> 00:13:08,926
- Hope you enjoy it.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.

226
00:13:08,926 --> 00:13:12,296
I wish I had a million dollars. 
Hot dog!

227
00:13:12,296 --> 00:13:15,150
Avast there, Captain Cook! 
You got your sealegs yet?

228
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,640
Parlez vous Francais, Mister?

229
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,667
Hey, send us some of their picture 
postcards, will you, George?

230
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:20,550
Hey, George, 
don't take any plugged nickels.

231
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,569
Hey, George, your suitcase is leaking.

232
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,982
Hey, Ernie! 
Hi, Ernie!

233
00:13:24,982 --> 00:13:26,014
- Hiya, George.
- Hi, Bert.

234
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,068
- George...
- Hey, hey, I, I'm a rich tourist today.

235
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:29,809
- How about driving me home in style?
- Great.

236
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:33,128
Hop in Your Highness, hop in. 
And for the carriage trade.

237
00:13:33,128 --> 00:13:34,755
I put on my hat.

238
00:13:36,725 --> 00:13:39,938
- Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.
- Hello, Violet.

239
00:13:39,938 --> 00:13:42,118
Hey, you look good. 
That's some dress you got on there.

240
00:13:42,118 --> 00:13:43,796
What! 
This old thing?

241
00:13:43,796 --> 00:13:46,105
Why, I only wear it when I don't care 
how I look.

242
00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:03,484
- How would you like...
- Yes.

243
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,182
Want to come along, Bert? 
We'll show you the town.

244
00:14:07,182 --> 00:14:11,396
No, thanks. I, uh, I've gotta go home 
and see what the wife's doing.

245
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:14,761
Family man.

246
00:14:16,384 --> 00:14:17,964
George! 
Harry!

247
00:14:17,964 --> 00:14:20,254
You're shaking the house down! 
Stop it!

248
00:14:20,254 --> 00:14:23,208
Oh, let them alone! 
I wish I was up there with them.

249
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:26,027
But Harry'll tear his dinner suit! 
George!

250
00:14:26,027 --> 00:14:28,182
That's why all children should be girls.

251
00:14:28,182 --> 00:14:30,459
But if they were all girls, 
there wouldn't be any...

252
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:32,027
Oh, never mind.

253
00:14:32,027 --> 00:14:34,522
George! Harry! 
Come down to dinner this minute.

254
00:14:34,522 --> 00:14:37,477
Everything's getting cold and you know, 
how long we've been waiting for you.

255
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,233
Okay, Mom!

256
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:52,553
- Here's a present for you, Pop.
- Oh, you two idiots!

257
00:14:52,553 --> 00:14:54,602
- George, sit down and have dinner.
- I've eaten.

258
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,073
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing 
for your graduating party?

259
00:14:57,073 --> 00:14:58,278
- Look at you!
- I don't care.

260
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:00,919
It's George's tux. Annie, my sweet, 
have you got those pies?

261
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:03,328
If you lay a hand on me, 
I'll hit you with this broom.

262
00:15:03,328 --> 00:15:05,786
Annie, I'm in love with you, 
there's a moon out tonight.

263
00:15:06,716 --> 00:15:10,624
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, my last meal 
in the old Bailey Boarding House.

264
00:15:10,624 --> 00:15:12,829
Oh, my lands, my blood pressure!

265
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,189
Pop, can I have the car? 
I have to take over a lot of plates and things.

266
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:16,455
- What plates?
- Oh, Mom,

267
00:15:16,455 --> 00:15:18,940
I'm Chairman of the Eats Committee 
and we only need a couple of dozen.

268
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,454
Oh, no, you don't. 
Harry, now, not my best Haviland.

269
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:24,527
Oh, let him have the plates, Mother.

270
00:15:24,527 --> 00:15:27,348
Hope you have a good trip, George. 
Uncle Billy and I are gonna miss you.

271
00:15:27,348 --> 00:15:30,490
I'll miss you too, Pop. 
What's the matter? You look tired.

272
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,050
- Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
- Oh.

273
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:36,002
I thought when we put him on the board 
of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.

274
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:38,857
Oh, what's eating that 
old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?

275
00:15:38,857 --> 00:15:41,451
Oh, he's a sick man. 
Frustrated and sick.

276
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:44,126
And his mind's sick in his soul, 
if he has one.

277
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:47,020
He hates everybody that has anything 
that he can't have.

278
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,730
He hates us mostly, I guess.

279
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,410
Gangway! Gangway! 
So long, Pop.

280
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,666
So long!

281
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,682
- Harry, you got a match?
- Very funny. Very funny.

282
00:15:53,682 --> 00:15:56,097
Put those things in the car and 
I'll get your tie and studs ready for you.

283
00:15:56,097 --> 00:15:57,768
- Now, hurry up, hurry up.
- Okay, Mom.

284
00:15:57,768 --> 00:15:58,919
- You coming later?
- Don't you drop one of those.

285
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:00,170
- You coming later, George?
- What do you mean,

286
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,108
- and be bored to death?
- Couldn't want a better death.

287
00:16:02,108 --> 00:16:04,329
Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to 
use that new floor tonight, too.

288
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:06,184
- Oh, I hope it works.
- No gin tonight, son!

289
00:16:06,184 --> 00:16:08,729
- Aw, Pop, just a little.
- No, son. Not one drop.

290
00:16:08,729 --> 00:16:09,946
Oh!

291
00:16:09,946 --> 00:16:14,163
Boys and girls and music...
why do they need gin?

292
00:16:14,163 --> 00:16:17,255
Father, did I act like that when 
I graduated from high school?

293
00:16:17,255 --> 00:16:18,314
Pretty much.

294
00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:21,675
You know, George, I wish we could 
send Harry to college with you.

295
00:16:21,675 --> 00:16:23,235
Your mother and I talked it over 
half the night.

296
00:16:23,235 --> 00:16:26,542
Mmm, we have that all figured out.

297
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:29,651
Harry'll take my job at the Building 
and Loan, and work there four years,

298
00:16:29,651 --> 00:16:30,930
then he'll go.

299
00:16:31,848 --> 00:16:34,907
- He's pretty young for that job.
- Well, no younger than I was.

300
00:16:34,907 --> 00:16:36,989
Maybe you were born older, George.

301
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:39,733
How's that?

302
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:41,471
I say, you were born older.

303
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,696
I suppose you've decided what you 
want to do when you get out of college.

304
00:16:44,696 --> 00:16:47,728
Oh well, you know what I've always 
talked about...build things...

305
00:16:47,728 --> 00:16:50,175
design new buildings...
plan modern cities...

306
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,059
- all that stuff, I was talking about.
- Still after that first million before you're thirty.

307
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:54,498
No, I'll settle for half that in cash.

308
00:16:56,365 --> 00:16:59,612
'Course it's just a hope, but uh,

309
00:16:59,612 --> 00:17:02,152
you wouldn't consider coming back 
to the Building and Loan, would you?

310
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:10,727
Well, I...I... Why, Annie, why, 
why don't you draw up a chair?

311
00:17:10,727 --> 00:17:13,769
Then you'd be more comfortable and 
you could hear everything that's going on.

312
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:16,204
I would if I thought I'd hear anything 
worth listening to.

313
00:17:16,204 --> 00:17:18,154
You would, eh?

314
00:17:18,154 --> 00:17:22,017
- I know it's soon to talk about it.
- Oh, now, Pop. I, I,

315
00:17:22,017 --> 00:17:29,392
I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up 
for the rest of my life in a shabby little office...

316
00:17:29,392 --> 00:17:31,880
Oh, I'm sorry, Pop, 
I didn't mean it that way,

317
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,342
but this business of nickels and dimes 
and spending all your life

318
00:17:36,342 --> 00:17:40,023
trying to figure out how to save three 
cents on a length of pipe...I'd go crazy.

319
00:17:40,023 --> 00:17:42,655
I...I wanna do something big 
and something important.

320
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,212
You know, George, 
I feel that in a small way we are doing 
something important.

321
00:17:47,212 --> 00:17:49,555
Satisfying a fundamental urge.

322
00:17:49,555 --> 00:17:54,044
It's deep in the race for a man to want 
his own roof and walls and fireplace.

323
00:17:54,044 --> 00:17:57,579
And we're helping him get those things 
in our shabby little office.

324
00:17:57,579 --> 00:18:04,773
I know, Pop. I, uh, I, I know that I, I... 
I wish I felt...

325
00:18:04,773 --> 00:18:08,566
but I, I've been hoarding pennies like 
a miser here in order to...

326
00:18:08,566 --> 00:18:10,819
Most of my friends 
have already finished college.

327
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:14,389
I, uh, I just feel like if I 
didn't get away, I'd bust.

328
00:18:14,389 --> 00:18:19,538
Yes, yes. You're right, son.

329
00:18:19,538 --> 00:18:21,439
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?

330
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:25,436
This town is no place for any man unless 
he's willing to crawl to Potter.

331
00:18:25,436 --> 00:18:28,739
And you've got talent, son. 
I've seen it.

332
00:18:28,739 --> 00:18:32,139
You get yourself an education. 
Then get out of here.

333
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:37,832
Pop, you want a shock?

334
00:18:37,832 --> 00:18:39,838
I think you're a great guy.

335
00:18:43,443 --> 00:18:44,869
Oh, did you hear that, Annie?

336
00:18:44,869 --> 00:18:48,710
I heard it. 
About time one of you lunkheads said it.

337
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:51,903
I'm going to miss old Annie.

338
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:58,839
Pop, I think I'll get dressed 
and go over to Harry's party.

339
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,259
Have a good time, son.

340
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,121
Here you are.

341
00:19:08,121 --> 00:19:09,320
George! 
Hello!

342
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,595
You know my kid brother, George?
I'm going to put him through college.

343
00:19:11,595 --> 00:19:14,276
- Hello, George! 
- Hee-haw!

344
00:19:14,276 --> 00:19:15,876
Oh, oh, Sam Wainwright.

345
00:19:15,876 --> 00:19:17,178
How are you? 
When did you get here?

346
00:19:17,178 --> 00:19:19,470
Oh, this afternoon. 
I thought I'd give the kids a treat.

347
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,931
Old college graduate now, huh?

348
00:19:20,931 --> 00:19:23,122
Yeah. Old Joe College Wainwright, 
they call me.

349
00:19:23,122 --> 00:19:25,688
Well, freshman, looks like 
you're going to make it after all.

350
00:19:25,688 --> 00:19:26,761
- Yep.
- Hey, hey!

351
00:19:26,761 --> 00:19:28,974
Harry! 
You're the guy I want to see.

352
00:19:28,974 --> 00:19:30,622
- The Coach has heard all about you.
- He has?

353
00:19:30,622 --> 00:19:32,600
Yeah. He's followed every game 
and his mouth's watering.

354
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,397
He wants me to find out if you're 
going to come along with us.

355
00:19:34,397 --> 00:19:36,399
Well, I eh, 
I gotta make some dough first.

356
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:38,931
Well, you'd better make it fast. 
We need great ends like you.

357
00:19:38,931 --> 00:19:41,053
not broken-down old guys 
like this one!

358
00:19:41,053 --> 00:19:42,347
- Hee-haw!
- Hee-haw!

359
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,775
George! 
Welcome back!

360
00:19:44,775 --> 00:19:46,361
Hello, Mr. Partridge, 
how are you?

361
00:19:46,361 --> 00:19:48,371
Putting a pool under this floor 
was a great idea.

362
00:19:48,371 --> 00:19:49,538
Saved us another building.

363
00:19:49,538 --> 00:19:51,591
Now, Harry, Sam, have a lot of fun.

364
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:52,971
There's lots of stuff here to eat and drink.

365
00:19:52,971 --> 00:19:57,258
- Lots of pretty girls around.
- Hey, George...

366
00:19:57,258 --> 00:19:59,907
- Hello, Violet. How are you...
- Hello. What am I bid?

367
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,995
- George...
- Marty. Well, it's old home week.

368
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:05,181
Marty! 
Glad to see you.

369
00:20:05,181 --> 00:20:07,148
- Do me a favor, will you, George?
- What's that?

370
00:20:07,148 --> 00:20:09,609
- Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

371
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:12,275
"Mamma wants you, Marty." 
"Mama wants you." Remember?

372
00:20:12,275 --> 00:20:13,308
Dance with her, will you?

373
00:20:13,308 --> 00:20:16,367
Oh, me? Oh, well, I feel funny enough 
already, with all these kids.

374
00:20:16,367 --> 00:20:17,367
Aw, come on. 
Be a sport.

375
00:20:17,367 --> 00:20:20,084
Just dance with her one time 
and you'll give her the thrill of her life.

376
00:20:20,084 --> 00:20:21,148
- Aw, go on.
- Hey, sis!

377
00:20:21,148 --> 00:20:24,247
And don't be long, Marty! 
I don't want to be a wet nurse for...

378
00:20:24,247 --> 00:20:26,574
And the next thing I knew, 
some guy came up and tripped me.

379
00:20:26,574 --> 00:20:28,594
That's the reason why I came in fourth.

380
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:31,347
If it hadn't been for that, that race 
would have been a cinch.

381
00:20:31,347 --> 00:20:34,465
I tried to find out who it was later 
but I couldn't find out.

382
00:20:34,465 --> 00:20:38,552
Nobody'd ever tell you who...whoever, 
whoever it was because they'd be scared.

383
00:20:38,552 --> 00:20:40,699
- They know what kind of a guy I am...
- You remember George?

384
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:44,814
- This is Mary. Well, I'll be seeing you.
- Well...well...well...

385
00:20:44,814 --> 00:20:47,625
Now, to get back to my story, see...

386
00:20:50,276 --> 00:20:51,835
Hey, this is my dance.

387
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:53,787
Oh, why don't you stop annoying people?

388
00:20:53,787 --> 00:20:55,764
Well, I'm sorry. Hey!

389
00:20:59,145 --> 00:21:02,332
- Well, hello.
- Hello.

390
00:21:02,332 --> 00:21:05,768
- You look at me as if you didn't know me.
- Well, I don't.

391
00:21:05,768 --> 00:21:08,110
You've passed me on the street 
almost every day.

392
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,775
Me?!
Uh-huh.Uh-uh.

393
00:21:09,775 --> 00:21:12,824
That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. 
That wasn't you.

394
00:21:12,824 --> 00:21:14,554
O-yes, o-yes, o-yes!

395
00:21:14,554 --> 00:21:17,120
The big Charleston contest!

396
00:21:19,055 --> 00:21:21,349
The prize? 
A genuine loving cup!

397
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:25,447
Those not tapped by the judges 
will remain on the floor. Let's go!

398
00:21:35,702 --> 00:21:38,681
- I'm not very good at this.
- Neither am I.

399
00:21:38,681 --> 00:21:40,291
Okay. What can we lose?

400
00:21:52,423 --> 00:21:53,984
Hey, you're wonderful!

401
00:22:21,709 --> 00:22:24,139
What's the matter, Othello, 
jealous?

402
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:29,263
Did you know there's a swimming pool 
under this floor?

403
00:22:29,263 --> 00:22:34,360
And did you know that button behind you 
causes this floor to open up?

404
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:41,518
And did you further know that George 
Bailey is dancing right over that crack?

405
00:22:41,518 --> 00:22:43,554
And I've got the key?

406
00:23:05,806 --> 00:23:08,779
Stand back, everybody! 
Stand back!

407
00:23:13,067 --> 00:23:15,222
They're cheering us. 
We must be good.

408
00:23:54,107 --> 00:23:57,439
Get out! 
Oh, well...

409
00:24:03,996 --> 00:24:06,192
Buffalo Gals, 
can't you come out tonight?

410
00:24:06,192 --> 00:24:09,013
Can't you come out tonight?
Can't you come out tonight?

411
00:24:09,013 --> 00:24:11,971
Buffalo Gals, 
can't you come out tonight?

412
00:24:11,971 --> 00:24:15,961
And dance

413
00:24:15,961 --> 00:24:23,852
by the light of the moon.

414
00:24:23,852 --> 00:24:26,715
- Oh, Hot dog! Just like an organ.
- Beautiful.

415
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,788
I told Harry I thought 
I'd be bored to death.

416
00:24:28,788 --> 00:24:30,637
You, you should have seen the 
commotion in that locker room.

417
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:33,651
I, I had to knock off three people 
to get this stuff we're wearing here.

418
00:24:33,651 --> 00:24:36,194
Here, let me, let me 
hold that old wet dress of yours.

419
00:24:36,194 --> 00:24:37,642
Do I look as funny as you do?

420
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,237
I guess I'm not quite the football type.

421
00:24:39,237 --> 00:24:42,024
I... You, you look wonderful!

422
00:24:42,024 --> 00:24:45,257
You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say 
you were the prettiest girl in town.

423
00:24:46,698 --> 00:24:49,110
Well, why don't you say it?

424
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:52,145
Well, I don't know. Maybe I will say it. 
How old are you anyway?

425
00:24:53,622 --> 00:24:56,103
- Eighteen.
- Eighteen?!

426
00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:58,842
Why, it was only last year 
you were seventeen.

427
00:24:58,842 --> 00:25:00,182
Too young or too old?

428
00:25:00,182 --> 00:25:03,632
Oh, no, no. Just right. 
Your age fits you.

429
00:25:03,632 --> 00:25:06,605
Yes, sir, you look a little older 
without your clothes on.

430
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:10,228
I, I mean, without a dress. 
You look older.

431
00:25:10,228 --> 00:25:13,078
I, I mean, younger. You look...
y-y-you just look...

432
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:14,417
- Oh, oh!
- Oh, oh!

433
00:25:14,417 --> 00:25:18,157
- Oh, no. I wanna...
- Sir, my train, please!

434
00:25:18,157 --> 00:25:20,885
A pox upon me for a clumsy lout.

435
00:25:20,885 --> 00:25:24,352
Your...your caboose, me lady.

436
00:25:25,336 --> 00:25:27,989
- You may kiss my hand.
- Ummm.

437
00:25:29,943 --> 00:25:31,325
Hey.

438
00:25:33,364 --> 00:25:34,581
Hey, Mary.

439
00:25:35,273 --> 00:25:38,674
As I was lumbering 
down the street,

440
00:25:38,674 --> 00:25:41,274
down the street, 
down the street...

441
00:25:41,274 --> 00:25:43,482
Okay then, I'll throw a rock 
at the old Granville house.

442
00:25:43,482 --> 00:25:45,812
Oh, no, don't! 
I-I love that old house.

443
00:25:45,812 --> 00:25:48,052
No. You see, you make a wish 
and then try and break some glass.

444
00:25:48,052 --> 00:25:49,669
And you got to be a pretty good 
shot nowadays, too.

445
00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:51,060
Oh, no, George, don't.

446
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,420
It's full of romance, that old place.

447
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,301
I'd like to live in it.

448
00:25:55,301 --> 00:25:56,911
- In that place?!
- Uh-huh.

449
00:25:56,911 --> 00:25:58,679
I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. 
Now watch.

450
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:00,571
There's a window right on 
the second floor there, see?

451
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:09,890
- What did you wish, George?
- Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful.

452
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,857
Mary, I know what I'm gonna do tomorrow

453
00:26:11,857 --> 00:26:14,555
and the next day and the next year 
and the year after that.

454
00:26:14,555 --> 00:26:17,576
I'm shaking the dust of this crummy 
little town off my feet

455
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,287
and I'm gonna see the world.

456
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:22,741
Italy, Greece, the Parthenon...
the Colesseum.

457
00:26:22,741 --> 00:26:25,204
Then I'm coming back here and go to 
college and see what they know

458
00:26:25,204 --> 00:26:26,909
and then I'm going to build things.

459
00:26:26,909 --> 00:26:28,469
I'm gonna build air fields.

460
00:26:28,469 --> 00:26:31,148
I'm gonna build skyscrapers a 
hundred stories high.

461
00:26:31,148 --> 00:26:33,715
I'm gonna build 
bridges a mile long.

462
00:26:33,715 --> 00:26:35,046
Well, are you gonna throw a rock?

463
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:41,306
Hey, that's pretty good.

464
00:26:42,357 --> 00:26:43,780
What'd you wish, Mary?

465
00:26:47,287 --> 00:26:49,562
Buffalo Gals, 
Can't you come out tonight?

466
00:26:49,562 --> 00:26:52,504
Can't you come out tonight?
Can't you come out tonight?

467
00:26:52,504 --> 00:26:55,446
Buffalo Gal, 
Can't you come out tonight?

468
00:26:55,446 --> 00:27:02,523
And dance by the light of the moon.

469
00:27:02,523 --> 00:27:04,375
What'd you wish 
when you threw that rock?

470
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:06,204
- Oh, no.
- Come on, tell me.

471
00:27:06,204 --> 00:27:08,154
If I told you, 
it might not come true.

472
00:27:08,154 --> 00:27:10,060
What is it you want, Mary?

473
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,110
What do you want?

474
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,909
You, you want the moon?!

475
00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:16,412
Just say the word and I'll throw a lasso 
around it and pull it down.

476
00:27:16,412 --> 00:27:18,825
Hey, that's a pretty good idea.

477
00:27:18,825 --> 00:27:23,715
- I'll give you the moon, Mary.
- I'll take it. Then what?

478
00:27:23,715 --> 00:27:25,430
Well then, you could swallow it,

479
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,537
and it'd all dissolve, see?

480
00:27:27,537 --> 00:27:30,920
And the moon beams'd shoot 
out of your fingers and your toes

481
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,874
and the ends of your hair.

482
00:27:34,511 --> 00:27:35,866
Am I talking too much?

483
00:27:35,866 --> 00:27:37,149
Yes!

484
00:27:38,235 --> 00:27:40,448
Why don't you kiss her 
instead of talking her to death?

485
00:27:40,448 --> 00:27:41,514
How's that?

486
00:27:41,514 --> 00:27:44,551
Why don't you kiss her 
instead of talking her to death?

487
00:27:46,796 --> 00:27:48,031
Want me to kiss her, huh?

488
00:27:48,031 --> 00:27:52,824
Aw, youth is wasted 
on the wrong people!

489
00:27:52,824 --> 00:27:56,187
Hey, hey, hold on. 
Hey, mister, come on back out here.

490
00:27:56,187 --> 00:27:58,964
I'll show you some kissing 
that'll put hair back on your head.

491
00:27:58,964 --> 00:28:00,293
What are you...

492
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,128
Mary?

493
00:28:20,123 --> 00:28:22,401
Okay, I give up. 
Where are you?

494
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:25,611
Over here, in the hydrangea bushes.

495
00:28:26,933 --> 00:28:29,079
Here you are. Catch.

496
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:31,769
Wait a minute. 
What am I doing?

497
00:28:35,734 --> 00:28:38,299
This is a very interesting situation!

498
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:41,955
- Please give me my robe.
- Hmm.

499
00:28:41,955 --> 00:28:44,697
A man doesn't get in a situation 
like this every day.

500
00:28:44,697 --> 00:28:46,736
I'd like to have my robe.

501
00:28:46,736 --> 00:28:48,398
Not in Bedford Falls anyway.

502
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:51,519
- Ooooouch! Oh!
- Gesundheit.

503
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:53,505
- George Bailey!
- This requires a little thought here.

504
00:28:53,505 --> 00:28:55,287
Give me my robe!

505
00:28:55,287 --> 00:28:57,633
I've read about things like this, 
but I never...

506
00:28:57,633 --> 00:29:00,666
Shame on you! 
I'm going to tell your mother on you!

507
00:29:00,666 --> 00:29:03,864
Oh, my mother's way up on the corner over there.

508
00:29:03,864 --> 00:29:05,682
I'll call the police!

509
00:29:05,682 --> 00:29:08,230
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.

510
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:11,172
Then, then, then I'm going to scream!

511
00:29:11,172 --> 00:29:13,867
Maybe I could sell tickets.

512
00:29:13,867 --> 00:29:19,061
Let's see. 
No, no, the point is, in order to get this robe...

513
00:29:19,061 --> 00:29:22,232
I've got it. I'll make a deal with you, Mary.

514
00:29:22,232 --> 00:29:24,037
George! 
George!

515
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:29,088
George! Come on home. 
Quick.

516
00:29:29,088 --> 00:29:30,598
You father's had a stroke!

517
00:29:30,598 --> 00:29:31,714
What?!

518
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,877
Mary! Mary, I'm sorry. 
I've got to go.

519
00:29:33,877 --> 00:29:34,976
Come on, George. Let's hurry!

520
00:29:34,976 --> 00:29:37,562
- Did you get a doctor?
- Yes. Campbell's there now.

521
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,377
I think that's all we'll need you for, George, 
I know you're anxious to make a train.

522
00:29:51,377 --> 00:29:53,057
I have a taxi waiting downstairs.

523
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:56,031
I want the Board to know that George 
gave up his trip to Europe

524
00:29:56,031 --> 00:29:59,314
to help straighten 
things out here these past few months.

525
00:29:59,314 --> 00:30:00,817
Good luck to you at school, George.

526
00:30:00,817 --> 00:30:03,110
- Thanks.
- Good luck! So long!

527
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,680
Now we come to the real purpose 
of this meeting...

528
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,399
to appoint a successor 
to our dear friend, Peter Bailey.

529
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,647
Mr. Chairman, 
I'd like to get to my real purpose.

530
00:30:10,647 --> 00:30:12,911
- Wait just a minute now.
- Wait for what?

531
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:16,437
I claim this institution is not necessary 
to this town.

532
00:30:16,437 --> 00:30:20,718
Therefore, Mr. Chairman, 
I make a motion to dissolve this institution

533
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:23,597
and turn its assets and liabilities over 
to the receiver.

534
00:30:23,597 --> 00:30:25,140
Potter, you dirty, contemptible...

535
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,368
I'll wring his neck, so help me, 
George,

536
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:27,979
- you hear what that buzzard...
- Mr. Chairman,

537
00:30:27,979 --> 00:30:32,440
it's too soon after Peter Bailey's death to talk 
about chloroforming the Building and Loan.

538
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,740
Peter Bailey died three months ago.

539
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,624
I second Mr. Potter's motion.

540
00:30:36,624 --> 00:30:40,596
Very well. In that case, I'll ask the 
two executive officers to withdraw.

541
00:30:40,596 --> 00:30:42,110
But before you go,

542
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:45,056
I'm sure the whole Board wishes 
to express its deep sorrow

543
00:30:45,056 --> 00:30:47,494
- at the passing of Peter Bailey.
- Thank you very much.

544
00:30:47,494 --> 00:30:51,168
It was his faith and devotion that are 
responsible for this organization.

545
00:30:51,168 --> 00:30:53,163
I'll go further than that.

546
00:30:53,163 --> 00:30:57,774
I'll say that to the public, Peter 
Bailey was the Building and Loan.

547
00:30:57,774 --> 00:31:00,064
Oh, that's fine, Potter, coming from you,

548
00:31:00,064 --> 00:31:02,056
considering that you probably drove 
him to his grave.

549
00:31:02,056 --> 00:31:05,093
Peter Bailey was not a business man.

550
00:31:05,093 --> 00:31:09,559
That's what killed him. Oh, I don't mean 
any disrespect to him, God rest his soul.

551
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:13,405
He was a man of high ideals, so-called.

552
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:17,881
But ideals without common sense 
can ruin this town.

553
00:31:17,881 --> 00:31:21,351
Now, you take this loan here to Ernie 
Bishop...

554
00:31:21,351 --> 00:31:27,312
you know, that fellow that sits around 
all day on his brains in his taxi, you know.

555
00:31:27,312 --> 00:31:32,760
I happen to know the bank turned down 
this loan, but he comes here

556
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:38,441
and we're building him a house 
worth five thousand dollars.

557
00:31:38,441 --> 00:31:40,853
- Why?
- Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter.

558
00:31:40,853 --> 00:31:42,160
You have all the papers there.

559
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,154
His salary, insurance. 
I can personally vouch for his character.

560
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:47,820
- A friend of yours.
- Yes, sir.

561
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:51,377
You see, if you shoot pool with 
some employee here,

562
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:54,036
you can come and borrow money.

563
00:31:54,036 --> 00:31:55,832
What does that get us?

564
00:31:55,832 --> 00:32:01,062
A discontented, lazy rabble 
instead of a thrifty working class.

565
00:32:01,062 --> 00:32:06,274
And all because a few starry-eyed 
dreamers like Peter Bailey

566
00:32:06,274 --> 00:32:10,477
stir them up and fill their heads 
with a lot of impossible ideas.

567
00:32:10,477 --> 00:32:13,015
- Now, I say...
- Just a minute. Just a...

568
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:15,446
Just a minute. 
Now, hold on, Mr. Potter.

569
00:32:15,446 --> 00:32:18,677
You're right when you say my father 
was no business man. I know that.

570
00:32:18,677 --> 00:32:21,992
Why he ever started this cheap penny-ante 
Building and Loan, I'll never know.

571
00:32:21,992 --> 00:32:25,381
But neither you nor anybody else can say 
anything against his character,

572
00:32:25,381 --> 00:32:27,367
because his whole life was...

573
00:32:27,367 --> 00:32:30,062
Why, in the twenty-five years since 
he and Uncle Billy started this thing,

574
00:32:30,062 --> 00:32:32,344
he never once thought of himself. 
Isn't that right, Uncle Billy?

575
00:32:32,344 --> 00:32:35,398
He didn't save enough money 
to send Harry to school, let alone me.

576
00:32:35,398 --> 00:32:38,197
But he did help a few people 
get out of your slums, Mr. Potter.

577
00:32:38,197 --> 00:32:39,501
And what's wrong with that?

578
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:42,216
Why...here, 
you are all businessmen here.

579
00:32:42,216 --> 00:32:45,354
Doesn't it make them better citizens? 
Doesn't it make them better customers?

580
00:32:45,354 --> 00:32:47,423
You...you said that uh...
what'd you say just a minute ago...

581
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:51,344
They, they had to wait and save their money 
before they even thought of a decent home.

582
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,276
Wait! Wait for what?

583
00:32:53,276 --> 00:32:54,765
Until their children grow up 
and leave them?

584
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:57,215
Until they're so old 
and broken-down that they...

585
00:32:57,215 --> 00:32:59,946
Do you know how long it takes a working 
man to save five thousand dollars?

586
00:32:59,946 --> 00:33:03,408
Just remember this, Mr. Potter, 
that this rabble you're talking about...

587
00:33:03,408 --> 00:33:07,483
they do most of the working and paying 
and living and dying in this community.

588
00:33:07,483 --> 00:33:09,746
Well, it is too much to have them work 
and pay and live and die

589
00:33:09,746 --> 00:33:11,779
in a couple of decent rooms 
and a bath?

590
00:33:11,779 --> 00:33:14,645
Anyway, my father didn't think so.

591
00:33:14,645 --> 00:33:16,135
People were human beings to him,

592
00:33:16,135 --> 00:33:20,040
but to you, a warped, 
frustrated old man, they're cattle.

593
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,547
Well, in my book, he died a much 
richer man than you'll ever be.

594
00:33:22,547 --> 00:33:26,911
I'm not interested in your book. 
I'm talking about the Building and Loan.

595
00:33:26,911 --> 00:33:28,772
I know very well what you're talking about.

596
00:33:28,772 --> 00:33:32,084
You're talking about something you can't 
get your fingers on, and it's galling you.

597
00:33:32,084 --> 00:33:34,542
That's what you're talking about, I know.

598
00:33:34,542 --> 00:33:36,372
Well, I, I, I've said too much.

599
00:33:36,372 --> 00:33:40,043
I... You're, you're the Board here. 
You do what you want with this thing.

600
00:33:40,043 --> 00:33:41,534
There's j-just one thing more though.

601
00:33:41,534 --> 00:33:44,698
This town needs this measly 
one-horse institution

602
00:33:44,698 --> 00:33:48,643
if only to have some place where people 
can come without crawling to Potter.

603
00:33:48,643 --> 00:33:49,910
Come on, 
Uncle Billy.

604
00:33:55,467 --> 00:34:01,002
Sentimental hogwash. 
I want my motion.

605
00:34:01,002 --> 00:34:03,275
Oh boy, that was telling him, 
George, old boy.

606
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:05,410
You shut his big mouth. 
You should have heard him.

607
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,613
What happened? 
We heard a lot of yelling.

608
00:34:06,613 --> 00:34:10,057
Well, we're being voted out of business 
after twenty-five years.

609
00:34:10,057 --> 00:34:11,527
Easy come, easy go.

610
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:13,480
Here it is. 
"Help wanted - Female."

611
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,638
You still want me hang around, George?

612
00:34:15,638 --> 00:34:16,820
Yeah, I'll be right down.

613
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,083
Hey, you'll miss your train.

614
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:19,947
You're a week late for school already. 
Go on.

615
00:34:19,947 --> 00:34:22,885
- What's going on in there?
- Oh, never mind. Don't worry about that.

616
00:34:22,885 --> 00:34:25,014
They're putting us out of business. 
So what?

617
00:34:25,014 --> 00:34:27,195
I can get another job. 
I'm only fifty-five.

618
00:34:27,195 --> 00:34:28,893
- Fifty-six.
- Go on, go on.

619
00:34:28,893 --> 00:34:32,117
Hey, look, you gave up your boat trip, 
now you don't want to miss college, too, do you?

620
00:34:32,117 --> 00:34:33,316
George! 
George!

621
00:34:33,316 --> 00:34:35,747
They voted Potter down. 
They want to keep it going.

622
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,022
- Whoopee!
- You did it, George, you did it.

623
00:34:39,022 --> 00:34:41,177
But they got one condition, 
only one condition.

624
00:34:41,177 --> 00:34:42,895
- What's that?
- That's the best part of it.

625
00:34:42,895 --> 00:34:46,306
They've appointed George here as 
Executive Secretary to take his father's place.

626
00:34:46,306 --> 00:34:47,578
Oh, no! 
But, Uncle Billy...

627
00:34:47,578 --> 00:34:49,340
You can keep him on. 
That's all right.

628
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,304
As Secretary you can hire anyone you like.

629
00:34:51,304 --> 00:34:53,216
Dr. Campbell, now let's get this thing straight.

630
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,773
I'm leaving. 
I'm leaving right now.

631
00:34:54,773 --> 00:34:56,499
I'm going to school. 
This is my last chance.

632
00:34:56,499 --> 00:34:58,040
Uncle Billy here, he's your man.

633
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,668
But, George, they'll vote with Potter otherwise.

634
00:35:03,043 --> 00:35:05,416
I know, I know, he didn't go.

635
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:06,497
That's right.

636
00:35:06,497 --> 00:35:11,106
Not only that, but he gave his school money 
to his brother, Harry, and sent him to college.

637
00:35:11,106 --> 00:35:12,900
Harry became a football star.

638
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,678
Made second team All-American.

639
00:35:14,678 --> 00:35:17,240
Yeah, but what happened to George?

640
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,378
George got four years older, 
waiting for Harry to come back

641
00:35:20,378 --> 00:35:22,157
and take over the Building and Loan.

642
00:35:22,157 --> 00:35:24,853
Oh, there are plenty of jobs around 
for somebody that likes to travel.

643
00:35:24,853 --> 00:35:26,044
Look at this. 
There...

644
00:35:26,044 --> 00:35:30,511
Venezuela oil fields - Wanted. 
Man with construction experience.

645
00:35:30,511 --> 00:35:35,266
Here's the Yukon, oh, right here - 
wanted - man with engineering experience.

646
00:35:36,127 --> 00:35:37,974
There she blows.

647
00:35:37,974 --> 00:35:40,365
You know what the three most exciting 
sounds in the world are?

648
00:35:40,365 --> 00:35:42,781
- Uh-huh. 
- Breakfast is served, lunch is served, dinner...

649
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:44,402
No, no, no, no!

650
00:35:44,402 --> 00:35:47,989
- Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
- Peanut?

651
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:49,308
There's the Professor now.

652
00:35:49,308 --> 00:35:53,220
- Old Professor Phil Beta Kappa Bailey! All-American.
- Well, if it isn't old George Geographic Explorer Bailey.

653
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,071
What? No husky dogs? 
No sled?

654
00:35:55,071 --> 00:35:56,541
Uncle Billy, you haven't changed a bit.

655
00:35:56,541 --> 00:35:59,931
- Nobody ever changes here, you know that.
- Oh, am I glad to see you.

656
00:35:59,931 --> 00:36:02,204
- Say, where's mother?
- She's home, cooking the fatted calf.

657
00:36:02,204 --> 00:36:04,183
- Come on. Let's go.
- Oh, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.

658
00:36:04,183 --> 00:36:07,176
George, Uncle Billy, 
I want you to meet Ruth.

659
00:36:07,176 --> 00:36:08,527
- Hello.
- How do you do.

660
00:36:08,527 --> 00:36:11,355
- Ruth Dakin.
- Ruth Dakin Bailey, if you don't mind.

661
00:36:11,355 --> 00:36:12,447
Huh?

662
00:36:12,447 --> 00:36:15,961
Well, I wired you I had a surprise. 
Here she is. Meet the wife.

663
00:36:15,961 --> 00:36:18,854
Well, what do you know - wife.

664
00:36:19,901 --> 00:36:22,725
Well, how do you do. 
Congratulations.

665
00:36:22,725 --> 00:36:24,773
What am I doing? 
Congratulations!

666
00:36:24,773 --> 00:36:28,659
They're married...
why didn't you tell somebody?

667
00:36:28,659 --> 00:36:32,136
...Oh, I can't wait to see Tilly's face.

668
00:36:32,136 --> 00:36:33,545
- Did you really marry him?
- Why, yes...

669
00:36:33,545 --> 00:36:36,870
What's a pretty girl like you doing 
marrying this two-headed brother of mine?

670
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,518
Well, I tell you. 
It's purely mercenary.

671
00:36:38,518 --> 00:36:39,804
My father offered him a job.

672
00:36:39,804 --> 00:36:44,459
Oh, he gets you and a job? 
Well, Harry's cup runneth over.

673
00:36:44,459 --> 00:36:47,359
Uh, George, about that job, 
Ruth spoke out of turn.

674
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,128
I never said I'd take it.

675
00:36:49,128 --> 00:36:51,997
You've been holding the bag here 
for four years, and...

676
00:36:51,997 --> 00:36:53,639
well, I won't let you down, George.

677
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:55,909
I would like to... Oh, wait a minute. 
I forgot the bags.

678
00:36:55,909 --> 00:36:57,004
I'll be right back.

679
00:36:57,894 --> 00:37:02,635
It was a surprise to me. 
This is the new Mrs. Bailey, my nephew's wife.

680
00:37:02,635 --> 00:37:08,434
Old, old friends of the family.

681
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:11,538
- Oh, of course, I've heard him speak of you.
- And I want you to tell you,

682
00:37:11,538 --> 00:37:18,102
we're going to give the biggest party 
this town ever saw.

683
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:20,003
Here, have some popcorn.

684
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:23,833
George, George, George, 
that's all Harry ever talks about.

685
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:27,994
Uh, uh, uh, Ruth, uh, this, 
uh, what about this job?

686
00:37:27,994 --> 00:37:30,487
Oh, well, my father owns 
a glass factory in Buffalo.

687
00:37:30,487 --> 00:37:32,947
He wants to get Harry started 
in the research business.

688
00:37:32,947 --> 00:37:35,518
- Well, is it a good job?
- Oh, yes, very.

689
00:37:35,518 --> 00:37:38,904
- Not much money, but, uh, good future, you know.
- I know.

690
00:37:38,904 --> 00:37:40,918
Harry's a genius at research.

691
00:37:40,918 --> 00:37:44,102
- My father just fell in love with him.
- And you did, too.

692
00:37:59,248 --> 00:38:02,150
Oh boy, oh boy, 
oh boy, oh boy.

693
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:06,235
I feel so good. 
I could spit in Potter's eye.

694
00:38:06,235 --> 00:38:09,136
I think I will. 
I think I will.

695
00:38:09,136 --> 00:38:11,436
What did you say? 
Huhh?

696
00:38:11,436 --> 00:38:13,691
Oh, maybe I'd better go home.

697
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:15,603
Where's my hat? 
Where's my...

698
00:38:15,603 --> 00:38:19,251
Oh! Oh, thank you, George, 
which is mine?

699
00:38:19,251 --> 00:38:22,590
- The middle one.
- Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy.

700
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:26,344
Now, look, if you'll point me in the right 
direction...would you do that, George?

701
00:38:26,344 --> 00:38:30,094
- Right down here.
- Oh...Old Building and Loan pal, huh...

702
00:38:30,094 --> 00:38:33,171
Now you just turn this way and 
go right straight down there.

703
00:38:33,171 --> 00:38:34,473
That way, huh?

704
00:38:34,473 --> 00:38:39,321
My Wild Irish rose...

705
00:38:42,138 --> 00:38:45,412
I'm all right. 
I'm all right.+++++++++++++++++++++++

706
00:38:45,412 --> 00:38:51,153
La flor mas dulce que crece...

707
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:28,727
Hola, Mami.

708
00:39:31,238 --> 00:39:32,463
No es nada.

709
00:39:33,936 --> 00:39:36,696
- ¿Que te parece ella?
- Oh, está bien.

710
00:39:36,696 --> 00:39:39,446
Parece  que puede mantener 
a Harry en línea recta.

711
00:39:39,446 --> 00:39:41,770
Lo mantendrá fuera de
 Bedford Falls de todos modos.

712
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:46,670
¿Sabías que Mary Hatch 
regresó ya del Colegio?

713
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:49,103
- Ah-hah.
- Regresó hace 3 días.

714
00:39:49,103 --> 00:39:50,847
Hmmm...

715
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:54,481
- Linda chica, Mary.
- Hmmm.

716
00:39:54,481 --> 00:39:57,502
De la clase que te ayudará
a encontrar las respuestas, George.

717
00:39:57,502 --> 00:40:00,624
- Hmmm...
- Oh, deja de gruñir.

718
00:40:00,624 --> 00:40:01,924
Hmmm.

719
00:40:01,924 --> 00:40:05,384
¿Podrías darme una buena razon
 para no llamar a Mary?

720
00:40:05,384 --> 00:40:07,098
- Seguro, Sam Wainwright.
- ¿Hmmm?

721
00:40:07,098 --> 00:40:10,446
- Si, Sam está loco por Mary.
- Pero, ella no está loca por él.

722
00:40:10,446 --> 00:40:11,450
Bien, ¿como lo sabes?

723
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,006
- Acaso, lo discutió contigo?
- No.

724
00:40:13,006 --> 00:40:15,867
- Bueno entonces, ¿como lo sabes?
- Bueno, tengo ojos, ¿no?

725
00:40:15,867 --> 00:40:19,126
Pues, ella titila como una luciérnaga 
en cuanto tú andas cerca.

726
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:20,324
Oh...

727
00:40:20,324 --> 00:40:24,637
Y ademas, Sam Wainwright está lejos
en N.York y tú aquí en Bedford Falls.

728
00:40:24,637 --> 00:40:27,368
Y todo vale en la guerra 
y el amor.

729
00:40:27,368 --> 00:40:28,898
Bueno, no conozco de la guerra.

730
00:40:32,737 --> 00:40:36,541
Madre mía, puedo ver atravez tuyo
justo atras del botón del collar...

731
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:38,808
- ¿tratando de librarte de mí, hah?
- Ah-hah.

732
00:40:41,371 --> 00:40:43,419
Bien, aquí está tu sombrero, 
que es tu prisa.

733
00:40:44,501 --> 00:40:47,338
Muy bien, Madre, 
Old Building y el conpinche Loan,

734
00:40:47,338 --> 00:40:50,478
creo que saldré y encontraré la chica 
y le daré un apasionado beso en el cuello.

735
00:40:50,478 --> 00:40:52,026
Oh, George...

736
00:40:52,026 --> 00:40:55,159
Ahora si me colocas en
la dirección correcta...

737
00:40:56,835 --> 00:40:58,074
¿esta dirección?

738
00:41:05,301 --> 00:41:06,772
Buenas noches, Mrs. Bailey.

739
00:41:18,221 --> 00:41:20,864
- Perdóname...
- Ahora, espera un minuto.

740
00:41:20,864 --> 00:41:23,194
Creo que tengo una cita.

741
00:41:23,194 --> 00:41:25,776
But uh, stick around, fellows, 
just in case, huh?

742
00:41:27,335 --> 00:41:28,837
We'll wait for you, baby.

743
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:33,605
- Hello, George-Porgie!
- What?

744
00:41:33,605 --> 00:41:36,863
- Hey, uh...What gives?
- Nothing.

745
00:41:37,697 --> 00:41:42,101
- Where are you going?
- Oh, I'm...probably end up down at the library.

746
00:41:42,101 --> 00:41:46,352
Georgie, don't you ever get tired of 
just reading about things?

747
00:41:47,383 --> 00:41:51,761
- Yes. What are you doing tonight?
- Not a thing.

748
00:41:52,331 --> 00:41:54,155
Are you game, Violet? 
Let's make a night of it.

749
00:41:54,155 --> 00:41:56,411
Oh, I'd love it, Georgie. 
What'll we do?

750
00:41:56,411 --> 00:41:59,774
Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes, 
and walk through the grass.

751
00:41:59,774 --> 00:42:00,822
Huh?

752
00:42:00,822 --> 00:42:03,876
Then we can to up to the falls. 
It's beautiful up there in the moonlight,

753
00:42:03,876 --> 00:42:06,112
and there's a green pool up there,

754
00:42:06,112 --> 00:42:08,692
and we can, uh, s-swim in it.

755
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,706
Then we can climb Mt. Bedford,

756
00:42:10,706 --> 00:42:13,674
and smell the pines 
and watch the sunrise against the peaks,

757
00:42:13,674 --> 00:42:15,163
and we'll stay up there the whole night,

758
00:42:15,163 --> 00:42:17,179
and everybody'll be talking 
and there'll be a terrific scandal...

759
00:42:17,179 --> 00:42:19,084
Georgie, have you gone crazy?

760
00:42:19,084 --> 00:42:21,087
Walk in the grass in my bare feet?

761
00:42:22,408 --> 00:42:25,226
- Why, it's ten miles up to Mt. Bedford.
- Shhh...

762
00:42:25,226 --> 00:42:28,616
- You think just because you...
- O-O-Okay, just forget about the whole thing.

763
00:42:46,617 --> 00:42:49,295
What are you doing, picketing?

764
00:42:49,295 --> 00:42:51,064
Hello, Mary.

765
00:42:51,064 --> 00:42:53,303
I just happened to be passing by.

766
00:42:53,303 --> 00:42:55,642
Yes, so I noticed.

767
00:42:55,642 --> 00:42:58,025
- Have you made up your mind?
- How's that?

768
00:42:58,025 --> 00:42:59,578
Have you made up your mind?

769
00:42:59,578 --> 00:43:02,800
- About what?
- About coming in.

770
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,520
Your mother just phoned and said 
you were on your way over to pay me a visit.

771
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,218
My mother just called you? 
Well, how did she know?

772
00:43:09,218 --> 00:43:11,050
- Didn't you tell her?
- I didn't tell anybody.

773
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:14,161
I just went for a walk and happened 
to be passing by, idiot.

774
00:43:14,161 --> 00:43:19,742
What do you... 
went for a walk. That's all.

775
00:43:21,044 --> 00:43:23,407
- I'll be downstairs, mother.
- All right, dear.

776
00:43:45,809 --> 00:43:48,557
Well, are you coming in 
or aren't you?

777
00:43:48,557 --> 00:43:54,107
Well, I'll come in for a minute. 
But I...

778
00:44:06,163 --> 00:44:09,094
I didn't tell anybody 
I was coming over here, you know.

779
00:44:11,078 --> 00:44:14,793
- When did you get back?
- Tuesday.

780
00:44:14,793 --> 00:44:16,691
Where'd you get that dress?

781
00:44:16,691 --> 00:44:19,123
- Do you like it?
- It's all right.

782
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:27,847
I thought you'd go back to New York like 
Sam and Angie, and the rest of them.

783
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:32,351
Oh, oh, I worked there a couple of vacations. 
But...

784
00:44:32,351 --> 00:44:34,402
I don't know... 
I-I guess I was homesick.

785
00:44:34,402 --> 00:44:37,796
Homesick? 
For Bedford Falls?

786
00:44:37,796 --> 00:44:44,575
Yes, and my family, and... 
Oh, everything.

787
00:44:44,575 --> 00:44:46,479
Would you like to sit down?

788
00:44:46,479 --> 00:44:48,053
All right, for a minute.

789
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:53,346
I-I still can't understand it though. 
You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.

790
00:44:53,346 --> 00:44:54,560
Would you rather leave?

791
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,493
No, I don't want to be rude.

792
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:58,294
Well, then sit down.

793
00:44:58,294 --> 00:44:59,435
What's this?

794
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:04,116
Some joke, huh?

795
00:45:09,469 --> 00:45:14,763
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles around here.

796
00:45:15,488 --> 00:45:16,823
Thank you.

797
00:45:22,738 --> 00:45:26,120
And dance by the...

798
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,250
What's the matter?

799
00:45:28,489 --> 00:45:30,488
Oh, oh, yeah...yeah...

800
00:45:32,999 --> 00:45:34,311
Well, I...

801
00:45:34,311 --> 00:45:36,683
It was nice about your brother Harry, 
and Ruth, isn't it?

802
00:45:36,683 --> 00:45:39,175
Oh...yeah, yeah. That's all right.

803
00:45:39,175 --> 00:45:40,360
Don't you like her?

804
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,641
Well, of course, I like her. She's a peach.

805
00:45:43,978 --> 00:45:48,070
Oh, it's just marriage in general 
you're not enthusiastic about, huh?

806
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:52,622
No. Uh, marriage is all right 
for Harry and Marty and Sam and you.

807
00:45:52,622 --> 00:45:54,417
Mary! Mary!

808
00:45:54,417 --> 00:45:55,989
Who's down there with you?

809
00:45:55,989 --> 00:45:57,956
It's George Bailey, Mother.

810
00:45:57,956 --> 00:46:00,874
George Bailey?! 
What's he want?

811
00:46:00,874 --> 00:46:02,773
I don't know.

812
00:46:02,773 --> 00:46:03,886
What do you want?

813
00:46:05,218 --> 00:46:06,907
Me?

814
00:46:06,907 --> 00:46:09,482
Not a thing. 
I-I just came in to get warm.

815
00:46:12,197 --> 00:46:15,325
He's making violent love to me, Mother.

816
00:46:15,325 --> 00:46:18,565
You tell him to go right back home, 
and don't you leave the house, either.

817
00:46:18,565 --> 00:46:21,720
Sam Wainwright promised to call you 
from New York tonight.

818
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,294
But your mother needn't...

819
00:46:23,294 --> 00:46:24,904
You know I - I didn't come here to...

820
00:46:24,904 --> 00:46:26,291
What did you come here for then?

821
00:46:26,291 --> 00:46:27,490
I don't know. 
You tell me.

822
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:29,220
You're supposed to be the one 
that has all the answers.

823
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,021
- You tell me.
- Why don't you go home?

824
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:33,924
That's where I'm going. I don't know 
why I came here in the first place.

825
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:35,412
- Good night.
- Good night!

826
00:46:35,412 --> 00:46:36,992
Mary! Mary!

827
00:46:36,992 --> 00:46:39,956
- The telephone. It's Sam!
- I'll get it.

828
00:46:39,956 --> 00:46:42,257
Whatever were you doing that you couldn't hear?

829
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:54,127
Mary, he'swaiting!

830
00:46:57,522 --> 00:46:58,779
Hello.

831
00:47:00,474 --> 00:47:01,922
I forgot my hat.

832
00:47:03,745 --> 00:47:07,289
Hee-haw! Hello, Sam, how are you?

833
00:47:07,289 --> 00:47:10,242
Aw, I'm great. 
Gee, it's good to hear your voice again.

834
00:47:10,242 --> 00:47:14,053
Oh, well, that's awfully sweet of you, Sam.

835
00:47:14,053 --> 00:47:17,481
There's an old friend of yours here. 
George Bailey.

836
00:47:17,481 --> 00:47:19,465
You mean old moss-back George?

837
00:47:19,465 --> 00:47:22,238
Yes. Old moss-back George.

838
00:47:22,238 --> 00:47:24,102
Hee-haw! Put him on.

839
00:47:24,102 --> 00:47:26,401
W-Wait just a minute. 
I-I'll call him. George!

840
00:47:26,401 --> 00:47:28,669
He doesn't want to speak to George, 
you idiot!

841
00:47:28,669 --> 00:47:29,938
He does so. 
He asked for him.

842
00:47:29,938 --> 00:47:34,251
Geo-George! 
George, Sam wants to speak to you.

843
00:47:38,686 --> 00:47:41,796
- Hi, Sam.
- Well, George Bailoffski!

844
00:47:41,796 --> 00:47:43,523
Hey, a fine pal you are.

845
00:47:43,523 --> 00:47:45,493
What're you trying to do? 
Steal my girl?

846
00:47:45,493 --> 00:47:48,353
W-W-What do you mean? 
Nobody's trying to steal anybody's girl.

847
00:47:48,353 --> 00:47:50,349
H-Here...here's Mary.

848
00:47:50,349 --> 00:47:51,923
No, no, wait a minute. Wait a minute. 
I want to talk to both of you.

849
00:47:51,923 --> 00:47:53,967
- Here to you.
- Tell Mary to get on the extension.

850
00:47:53,967 --> 00:47:56,208
- You tell him.
- Mother's on the extension. We...

851
00:47:56,208 --> 00:47:57,521
I am not!

852
00:47:58,212 --> 00:48:00,799
We can both hear. 
Come here.

853
00:48:00,799 --> 00:48:02,917
We-We're listening, Sam.

854
00:48:02,917 --> 00:48:06,522
Well look, I have a big deal coming up 
that's going to make us all rich.

855
00:48:06,522 --> 00:48:09,540
George, you remember that night 
in Martini's Bar when, eh,

856
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:12,639
you told me you read someplace 
about making plastics out of soybeans?

857
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:13,891
Jelly beans?

858
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:14,932
Shut up, will you?

859
00:48:14,932 --> 00:48:18,887
Do you remember out of jelly-
...out of soybeans?

860
00:48:18,887 --> 00:48:22,077
Huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah...
soybeans. Yeah.

861
00:48:22,077 --> 00:48:24,692
Well, listen. 
Dad snapped up the idea.

862
00:48:24,692 --> 00:48:26,952
And he's going to build a factory 
outside of Rochester.

863
00:48:26,952 --> 00:48:28,305
How do you like that?

864
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,973
Rochester? 
Well, why Rochester?

865
00:48:33,973 --> 00:48:36,856
Well, why not? 
Can you think of anything better?

866
00:48:36,856 --> 00:48:38,598
Oh, I don't know... 
It's just...

867
00:48:38,598 --> 00:48:40,273
Why not right here?

868
00:48:40,273 --> 00:48:43,565
Y-You remember that...
that old tool and machinery works?

869
00:48:43,565 --> 00:48:45,955
W-Well, you tell your father 
he can get that for a song.

870
00:48:45,955 --> 00:48:47,238
And all the labor he wants, too.

871
00:48:47,238 --> 00:48:50,070
Half the town was thrown out of work 
when they closed down.

872
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:52,309
Is that so? Well, I'll tell him.

873
00:48:52,309 --> 00:48:53,849
Hey, that sounds great.

874
00:48:53,849 --> 00:48:55,678
Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through.

875
00:48:55,678 --> 00:48:57,031
Now here's the point,

876
00:48:57,031 --> 00:49:01,531
Mary...Mary, you're in on this, too. 
Now listen, have you got any money?

877
00:49:04,043 --> 00:49:06,901
- Money? Yeah...well, a little.
- Well now, listen.

878
00:49:06,901 --> 00:49:10,705
I want you to put every cent 
you've got into our stock, you hear?

879
00:49:10,705 --> 00:49:13,401
And George, I may have a job for you,

880
00:49:13,401 --> 00:49:16,725
that is, unless you're still married 
to that broken-down Building and Loan.

881
00:49:17,994 --> 00:49:21,830
Well, this is the biggest thing since radio. 
And I'm letting you in on the ground floor.

882
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:24,124
Oh, Mary...
Mary...

883
00:49:25,953 --> 00:49:28,396
Well, I-I'm here.

884
00:49:28,396 --> 00:49:32,231
Uh, would you tell that guy 
I'm giving him the chance of a lifetime, you hear?

885
00:49:32,231 --> 00:49:34,170
The chance of a lifetime.

886
00:49:37,787 --> 00:49:40,686
H-He says it's the chance of a lifetime.

887
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:45,409
Now you listen to me.

888
00:49:45,409 --> 00:49:48,507
I don't want any plastics. 
I don't want any ground floors.

889
00:49:48,507 --> 00:49:52,047
And I don't want to get married ever to anyone. 
You understand that?

890
00:49:52,047 --> 00:49:54,266
I want to do what I want to do.

891
00:49:54,266 --> 00:49:56,586
And you're...
and you're...

892
00:49:57,295 --> 00:50:01,447
- Oh, Mary...Mary...
- George...George...George...

893
00:50:03,686 --> 00:50:09,899
Mary... Would you? 
Would you...

894
00:50:13,828 --> 00:50:16,167
Here they come! 
Here they come!

895
00:50:37,742 --> 00:50:38,942
Goodbye.

896
00:50:54,421 --> 00:50:56,983
First Harry. 
Now George.

897
00:50:56,983 --> 00:50:59,253
Annie, we're just two old maids now.

898
00:50:59,253 --> 00:51:01,395
You speak for yourself, Mrs. B.

899
00:51:04,076 --> 00:51:07,454
If either of you two see a stranger 
around here, it's me.

900
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:12,166
Hey, look! 
There's somebody driving this cab.

901
00:51:12,166 --> 00:51:14,126
Bert the cop sent this over.

902
00:51:14,126 --> 00:51:16,393
He said to float away to Happy Land 
on the bubbles.

903
00:51:16,393 --> 00:51:19,009
- Oh, look at this. Old Bert. Champagne!
- Good old Bert.

904
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:22,046
By the way, where are you two going 
on this here now honeymoon?

905
00:51:22,046 --> 00:51:23,416
Where are we going?

906
00:51:23,416 --> 00:51:25,397
Look at this. 
There's the kitty, Ernie.

907
00:51:25,397 --> 00:51:27,189
Here, come on, count it, Mary.

908
00:51:27,189 --> 00:51:29,017
I feel like a bootlegger's wife. 
Look!

909
00:51:29,017 --> 00:51:31,270
You know what we're going to do? 
We're going to shoot the works.

910
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:33,575
A whole week in New York. 
A whole week in Bermuda.

911
00:51:33,575 --> 00:51:36,256
The highest hotels, the oldest champagne,

912
00:51:36,256 --> 00:51:40,824
the richest caviar, the hottest music, 
and the prettiest wife!

913
00:51:40,824 --> 00:51:42,376
Wow! 
That does it! Then what?

914
00:51:42,376 --> 00:51:46,760
- Then what, honey? 
- After that, who cares?

915
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,074
That does it, 
come here, come here, come here!

916
00:51:51,789 --> 00:51:55,912
Don't look now, but there's something funny 
going on over there at the bank, George.

917
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:59,615
I've never really seen one, but that's got 
all the earmarks of being a run.

918
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:10,368
Hey, Ernie, if you got any money 
in the bank, you better hurry.

919
00:52:10,368 --> 00:52:13,116
- George, let's not stop. Let's go.
- Just a minute, dear.

920
00:52:15,627 --> 00:52:18,216
- Oh-oh...
- Please, let's not stop, George.

921
00:52:18,216 --> 00:52:19,567
I'll be back in a minute, Mary.

922
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:39,373
Well, hello, everybody. 
Mrs. Thompson, how are you?

923
00:52:39,373 --> 00:52:41,735
Charlie? 
What's the matter here, can't you get in?

924
00:52:59,541 --> 00:53:01,658
What is this, Uncle Billy? 
A holiday?

925
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:03,342
George...

926
00:53:04,083 --> 00:53:05,535
Come on in, everybody. 
That's right.

927
00:53:06,566 --> 00:53:07,861
Just come on in.

928
00:53:11,715 --> 00:53:13,323
Now look, 
why don't you all sit down?

929
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:15,130
There are a lot of seats over there.

930
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:17,989
Just make yourself at home.

931
00:53:20,024 --> 00:53:22,141
George, can I see you a minute?

932
00:53:23,188 --> 00:53:25,239
- Why didn't you call me?
- I just did, but they said you left.

933
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:26,898
This is a pickle, George. 
This is a pickle.

934
00:53:26,898 --> 00:53:28,383
All right now, what happened? 
How did it start?

935
00:53:28,383 --> 00:53:30,927
Well, how does a thing like this ever start? 
All I know is the bank called our loan.

936
00:53:30,927 --> 00:53:32,257
- When?
- About an hour ago.

937
00:53:32,257 --> 00:53:34,288
- I had to hand over all our cash.
- All of it?

938
00:53:34,288 --> 00:53:35,967
Every cent of it 
and it still was less than we owe.

939
00:53:35,967 --> 00:53:37,798
Holy mackerel!

940
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:41,597
And then I got scared, George, 
and closed the doors. I...I...I...

941
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:45,463
The whole town's gone crazy.

942
00:53:45,463 --> 00:53:47,003
Yes, h-hello?

943
00:53:47,003 --> 00:53:49,170
George, it's Potter.

944
00:53:52,957 --> 00:53:54,513
- Hello?
- George,

945
00:53:54,513 --> 00:54:00,006
there is a rumor around town that you've 
closed your doors. Is that true?

946
00:54:00,006 --> 00:54:04,125
Oh, well, I'm very glad to hear that. 
George, are you all right?

947
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:07,242
- Do you need any police?
- Police? What's for?

948
00:54:07,242 --> 00:54:11,504
Well, mobs get pretty ugly 
sometimes, you know.

949
00:54:11,504 --> 00:54:16,345
George, I'm going all out 
to help in this crisis.

950
00:54:16,345 --> 00:54:21,796
I've just guaranteed the bank 
sufficient funds to meet their needs.

951
00:54:21,796 --> 00:54:25,100
They'll close up for a week 
and then reopen.

952
00:54:25,893 --> 00:54:27,192
He just took over the bank.

953
00:54:28,035 --> 00:54:33,622
I may lose a fortune, 
but I'm willing to guarantee your people too.

954
00:54:33,622 --> 00:54:38,800
Just tell them to bring their shares over here, 
and I will pay fifty cents on the dollar.

955
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,055
Aw, you never miss a trick, do you, Potter?

956
00:54:41,055 --> 00:54:42,169
Well, you're gonna miss this one.

957
00:54:42,169 --> 00:54:46,119
If you close your doors before six P.M., 
you will never reopen.

958
00:54:54,857 --> 00:54:58,027
George, was it a nice wedding? 
Gosh, I wanted to be there.

959
00:54:58,888 --> 00:55:00,001
Yeah...

960
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:03,860
You can take this one off now.

961
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:18,036
Now, just remember that this thing isn't 
as black as it appears.

962
00:55:27,589 --> 00:55:29,402
I have some news for you folks.

963
00:55:29,402 --> 00:55:32,693
I was just talking to old man Potter 
and he's guaranteed cash payments at the bank.

964
00:55:32,693 --> 00:55:34,316
The bank's going to reopen next week.

965
00:55:34,316 --> 00:55:36,231
But, George, I got my money here.

966
00:55:36,231 --> 00:55:38,025
Did he guarantee this place?

967
00:55:38,025 --> 00:55:39,812
Well, no, Charlie. 
I didn't even ask him.

968
00:55:39,812 --> 00:55:42,488
- We don't need Potter over here.
- I'll take mine now.

969
00:55:43,195 --> 00:55:47,703
No, but you...you...
you're thinking of this place all wrong.

970
00:55:47,703 --> 00:55:49,549
As if I had the money back in a safe.

971
00:55:49,549 --> 00:55:51,616
The, the money's not here.

972
00:55:51,616 --> 00:55:54,142
Well, your money's in Joe's house...
that's right next to yours.

973
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:58,113
And in the Kennedy House, and Mrs. Macklin's 
house, and, and a hundred others.

974
00:55:58,113 --> 00:55:59,953
Why, you're lending them the money to build,

975
00:55:59,953 --> 00:56:01,684
and then, they're going to pay it 
back to you as best they can.

976
00:56:01,684 --> 00:56:03,479
Now what are you going to do? 
Foreclose on them?

977
00:56:03,479 --> 00:56:06,322
I got two hundred and forty-two dollars 
in here

978
00:56:06,322 --> 00:56:09,782
and two hundred and forty-two dollars 
isn't going to break anybody.

979
00:56:10,675 --> 00:56:14,563
Okay, Tom. All right. 
Here you are. You sign this.

980
00:56:14,563 --> 00:56:17,191
- You'll get your money in sixty days.
- Sixty days?

981
00:56:17,191 --> 00:56:19,363
Well, now that's what you agreed 
to when you bought you shares.

982
00:56:19,363 --> 00:56:21,488
- Tom...Tom... Did you get your money?
- No.

983
00:56:21,488 --> 00:56:25,299
Well, I did. Old man Potter'll pay fifty cents 
on the dollar for every share you got.

984
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:28,043
- Fifty cents on the dollar!
- Yes, cash!

985
00:56:28,043 --> 00:56:30,719
- Well, what do you say?
- Now, Tom,

986
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:32,432
you have to stick to your original agreement.

987
00:56:32,432 --> 00:56:34,956
- Now give us sixty days on this.
- Okay, Randall.

988
00:56:34,956 --> 00:56:37,793
- Are you going to go to Potter's?
- Better get half than nothing.

989
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,798
Tom! 
Tom!

990
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:43,042
Randall, now wait a minute, wait...

991
00:56:43,042 --> 00:56:44,854
now listen...now listen to me.

992
00:56:44,854 --> 00:56:47,244
I-I beg of you not to do this thing.

993
00:56:47,244 --> 00:56:48,968
If Potter gets ahold of this Building and Loan,

994
00:56:48,968 --> 00:56:50,944
there'll never be another decent 
house built in this town.

995
00:56:50,944 --> 00:56:53,536
He's already got charge of the bank. 
He's got the bus line.

996
00:56:53,536 --> 00:56:55,823
He's got the department stores. 
And now he's after us.

997
00:56:55,823 --> 00:56:57,414
Why? 
Well, it's very simple.

998
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,956
Because we're cutting in on his business, 
that's why.

999
00:56:59,956 --> 00:57:02,000
And because he wants 
to keep you living in his slums

1000
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,080
and paying the kind of rent he decides.

1001
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,894
Joe, you had one of those Potter houses, 
didn't you? Well, have you forgotten?

1002
00:57:06,894 --> 00:57:09,727
Have you forgotten what he charged 
for that broken-down shack?

1003
00:57:09,727 --> 00:57:12,730
Here, Ed. You know, you remember last year 
when things weren't going so well,

1004
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:14,048
you couldn't make your payments.

1005
00:57:14,048 --> 00:57:17,151
You didn't lose your house, did you? 
Do you think Potter would have let you keep it?

1006
00:57:17,151 --> 00:57:20,221
Ca-Can't you understand 
what's happening here?

1007
00:57:20,221 --> 00:57:21,936
Don't you see what's happening?

1008
00:57:21,936 --> 00:57:24,104
Potter isn't selling. 
Potter's buying.

1009
00:57:24,104 --> 00:57:27,040
And why? Because we're panicky and he's not. 
That's why.

1010
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,186
He's picking up some bargains.

1011
00:57:28,186 --> 00:57:30,815
Now, We-We can get through this thing all right.

1012
00:57:30,815 --> 00:57:34,174
We-We've got to stick together, though. 
We've got to have faith in each other.

1013
00:57:34,174 --> 00:57:37,381
But my husband hasn't worked in 
over a year and I need money.

1014
00:57:37,381 --> 00:57:40,749
- How am I going to live until the bank opens?
- I got doctor bills to pay.

1015
00:57:40,749 --> 00:57:43,390
- I need cash.
- I can't feed my kids on faith.

1016
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:45,481
How much do you need?

1017
00:57:45,481 --> 00:57:48,801
Hey! 
I got two thousand dollars.

1018
00:57:49,697 --> 00:57:52,276
Here's two thousand dollars. 
This'll tide us over until the bank reopens.

1019
00:57:52,276 --> 00:57:53,356
All right, 
Tom, how much do you need?

1020
00:57:53,356 --> 00:57:54,981
Two hundred and forty-two dollars.

1021
00:57:54,981 --> 00:57:57,403
Aw, Tom, just enough to tide you over 
till the bank reopens.

1022
00:57:57,403 --> 00:58:00,125
I'll take 
two hundred and forty-two dollars.

1023
00:58:02,534 --> 00:58:04,345
- There you are.
- That'll close my account.

1024
00:58:04,345 --> 00:58:06,795
Your account's still here. 
That's a loan.

1025
00:58:06,795 --> 00:58:08,540
Okay. All right, Ed?

1026
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:10,883
- I got three hundred dollars here, George.
- Alright, now, Ed...

1027
00:58:10,883 --> 00:58:13,919
wh-wh-what'll it take till the bank opens? 
What do you need?

1028
00:58:13,919 --> 00:58:18,174
- Well, I-I suppose twenty dollars.
- Twenty dollars. Now you're talking.

1029
00:58:18,174 --> 00:58:19,372
Fine. 
Thanks, Ed.

1030
00:58:19,372 --> 00:58:20,996
All right now, Mrs. Thompson, 
how much do you want?

1031
00:58:20,996 --> 00:58:22,892
- But it's your own money, George.
- Never mind about that.

1032
00:58:22,892 --> 00:58:25,299
- How much do you want?
- I can get along with twenty, all right.

1033
00:58:25,299 --> 00:58:27,309
- Twenty dollars.
- And I'll sign a paper.

1034
00:58:27,309 --> 00:58:28,441
You don't have to sign anything.

1035
00:58:28,441 --> 00:58:29,963
I know you-you'll pay it when you can.

1036
00:58:29,963 --> 00:58:32,199
That's okay. 
All right, Mrs. Davis?

1037
00:58:32,199 --> 00:58:36,324
- Could I have seventeen-fifty?
- Seven...

1038
00:58:36,324 --> 00:58:39,375
Bless your heart, of course you can have it. 
You got fifty cents?

1039
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:40,821
- Seven...
- We're going to make it, George.

1040
00:58:40,821 --> 00:58:44,653
- They'll never close us up today!
- Six, five, four,

1041
00:58:44,653 --> 00:58:47,937
three, two, one...

1042
00:58:47,937 --> 00:58:49,291
Bingo!

1043
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:51,513
We made it. Close the door, Ernie. 
We made it. Look.

1044
00:58:51,513 --> 00:58:54,021
Look, we're still in business. 
We're still got two bucks left.

1045
00:58:54,021 --> 00:58:55,763
Well, look, let's have some of that. 
Let's celebrate, huh.

1046
00:58:55,763 --> 00:58:57,364
G-Get some glasses, 
Tilly.

1047
00:58:57,364 --> 00:58:59,226
Well, a couple of financial wizards.

1048
00:58:59,226 --> 00:59:00,880
Those Rockefellers.

1049
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,286
Get a tray for these two great 
big important simoleans here.

1050
00:59:03,286 --> 00:59:04,945
We'll save them for seed. 
A toast.

1051
00:59:04,945 --> 00:59:08,366
A toast! A toast to Mama Dollar 
and to Papa Dollar,

1052
00:59:08,366 --> 00:59:10,622
and if you want to keep this 
old Building and Loan in business,

1053
00:59:10,622 --> 00:59:12,969
- you better have a family real quick.
- I wish they were rabbits.

1054
00:59:12,969 --> 00:59:14,295
I wish they were, too.

1055
00:59:15,439 --> 00:59:17,801
Okay, let's put them in safe 
and see what happens.

1056
00:59:27,094 --> 00:59:30,604
- Folks, folks, wedding cigars!
- Oh-oh...wedding!

1057
00:59:30,604 --> 00:59:34,193
Holy mackerel, I'm married! 
Where's Mary? Mary...

1058
00:59:34,193 --> 00:59:35,270
Well, poor Mary.

1059
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:37,354
Look, I've got a train to catch. 
Well, the train's gone.

1060
00:59:37,354 --> 00:59:39,981
I wonder if Ernie's still here with his taxicab?

1061
00:59:39,981 --> 00:59:42,438
George, there's a call for you.

1062
00:59:42,438 --> 00:59:45,261
Look, will you get my wife on the phone? 
She's probably over at her mother's.

1063
00:59:45,261 --> 00:59:47,834
- Mrs. Bailey is on the phone.
- I don't want Mrs. Bailey.

1064
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:51,004
I want my wife. 
Mrs. Bailey! Mrs...oh, that's my wife.

1065
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:53,029
Here, I'll take it in here.

1066
00:59:53,029 --> 00:59:56,558
Mary! Hello. Listen, dear. 
I'm sorry...

1067
00:59:56,558 --> 01:00:01,006
What? Come home? 
What home?

1068
01:00:01,006 --> 01:00:03,212
Three-twenty Sycamore? 
Well, what...

1069
01:00:03,212 --> 01:00:08,186
whose home is that? 
The Waldorf Hotel, huh?

1070
01:00:18,358 --> 01:00:21,188
Hey, this is the company's posters, 
and the company won't like this.

1071
01:00:21,188 --> 01:00:23,385
How would you like to get a ticket next week?

1072
01:00:23,385 --> 01:00:26,318
- Haven't you any romance in you?
- Sure I have, but I got rid of it.

1073
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:27,466
Liver pills!

1074
01:00:27,466 --> 01:00:30,295
Who wants to see liver pills on their honeymoon?

1075
01:00:30,295 --> 01:00:34,268
What we want is romantic places, 
beautiful places...places George wants to go.

1076
01:00:35,758 --> 01:00:38,868
- Hey, Bert. Here he comes.
- Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.

1077
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:40,793
- Who?
- The groom, idiot.

1078
01:00:40,793 --> 01:00:42,740
This is their honeymoon. 
Come on. Get that ladder.

1079
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:44,064
What are they - ducks?

1080
01:00:47,186 --> 01:00:49,618
- Get that ladder up here.
- All right, all right.

1081
01:00:49,618 --> 01:00:52,020
- Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.
- I'm hurrying.

1082
01:01:01,452 --> 01:01:04,080
Hiya...Geo...uh...good evening, sir.

1083
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:08,098
Entree, Monsieur.

1084
01:01:09,673 --> 01:01:16,995
- Entree.
- Islands of Hawaii,

1085
01:01:16,995 --> 01:01:26,804
Where skies of blue are calling me.

1086
01:01:26,804 --> 01:01:36,696
Where balmy air and golden moonlight

1087
01:01:36,696 --> 01:01:45,987
caress The waving palms of Waikiki.

1088
01:02:29,544 --> 01:02:31,509
Welcome home, Mr. Bailey.

1089
01:02:36,949 --> 01:02:38,965
Well, I'll be...

1090
01:02:43,855 --> 01:02:46,277
Mary, where did you...

1091
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:58,431
I Love You Truly,

1092
01:02:58,431 --> 01:03:03,552
Truly, Dear.

1093
01:03:03,552 --> 01:03:08,093
Life with Its Shadows,

1094
01:03:08,093 --> 01:03:09,180
Oh, Mary...

1095
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:12,015
Life with Its Tears.

1096
01:03:12,015 --> 01:03:13,770
Remember the night we broke 
the windows in this old house?

1097
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:19,199
Fade into Dreams,
- This is what I wished for.

1098
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:23,227
When I Feel You Are Near,

1099
01:03:23,227 --> 01:03:32,910
- Darling, you're wonderful.
I Love You Truly,

1100
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:39,977
Truly, Dear.

1101
01:03:48,364 --> 01:03:52,563
- Martini, you rented a new house?
- Rent?

1102
01:03:53,779 --> 01:03:56,307
- You hear what he say, Mr. Bailey?
- What's that?

1103
01:03:56,307 --> 01:03:58,273
I own the house.

1104
01:03:58,273 --> 01:04:01,702
Me, Giuseppe Martini, I own my own house.

1105
01:04:01,702 --> 01:04:05,115
No more we live like pigs in this Potter's Field.

1106
01:04:05,115 --> 01:04:06,565
Hurry, Marie!

1107
01:04:06,565 --> 01:04:07,988
Come on...
Bring the baby.

1108
01:04:08,844 --> 01:04:10,743
This is like a dream!

1109
01:04:10,743 --> 01:04:11,941
I'll take the kids in the car.

1110
01:04:11,941 --> 01:04:13,863
Oh, thank you, Mr. Bailey.

1111
01:04:13,863 --> 01:04:15,897
All right, kids. Here.

1112
01:04:15,897 --> 01:04:16,994
Get in here.

1113
01:04:16,994 --> 01:04:18,927
Now get right up on the seat there.

1114
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:23,050
Get the...get the dog!

1115
01:04:25,103 --> 01:04:26,862
You've got a goat too!

1116
01:04:28,181 --> 01:04:33,868
- All right. Goodbye.
- Goodbye, everybody!

1117
01:04:36,548 --> 01:04:37,577
All in.

1118
01:04:56,336 --> 01:04:58,452
Mr. and Mrs. Martini, welcome home.

1119
01:04:59,242 --> 01:05:01,543
Good old George. 
He's always making a speech.

1120
01:05:02,812 --> 01:05:04,645
Hee-haw!

1121
01:05:04,645 --> 01:05:08,642
- Sam Wainwright!
- Oh, who cares!

1122
01:05:08,642 --> 01:05:11,682
Bread! 
That this house may never know hunger.

1123
01:05:12,459 --> 01:05:15,956
Salt! 
That life may always have flavor!

1124
01:05:15,956 --> 01:05:19,740
And wine!! 
That joy and prosperity may reign forever.

1125
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:21,674
Enter the Martini castle!

1126
01:05:23,402 --> 01:05:25,809
Look, Mr. Potter, it's no skin off my nose.

1127
01:05:25,809 --> 01:05:27,673
I'm just your little rent collector.

1128
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:31,502
But you can't laugh off this Bailey Park 
anymore. Look at it.

1129
01:05:32,806 --> 01:05:34,598
Congressman Black is here to see you.

1130
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:37,755
Oh, tell the congressman to wait.
Go on.

1131
01:05:37,755 --> 01:05:40,638
Fifteen years ago, a half-dozen houses 
stuck here and there.

1132
01:05:40,638 --> 01:05:42,964
There's the old cemetery, squirrels, 
buttercups, daisies.

1133
01:05:42,964 --> 01:05:44,770
I used to hunt rabbits there myself.

1134
01:05:46,177 --> 01:05:47,581
Look at it today.

1135
01:05:47,581 --> 01:05:50,583
Dozens of the prettiest little homes you ever saw.

1136
01:05:50,583 --> 01:05:53,856
Ninety per cent owned by suckers 
who used to pay rent to you!

1137
01:05:53,856 --> 01:05:57,335
Your Potter's Field, my dear Mr. Employer, 
is becoming just that.

1138
01:05:57,335 --> 01:06:00,879
And are the local yokels making with 
those David and Goliath wisecracks.

1139
01:06:00,879 --> 01:06:02,606
Oh, they are, are they?

1140
01:06:02,606 --> 01:06:05,488
Even though they know the Baileys 
never made a dime out of it.

1141
01:06:05,488 --> 01:06:06,772
You know very well why,

1142
01:06:06,772 --> 01:06:08,176
the Baileys were all chumps.

1143
01:06:08,176 --> 01:06:12,350
Every one of these homes is worth twice 
what it cost the Building and Loan to build.

1144
01:06:12,350 --> 01:06:15,044
- If I were you, Mr. Potter...
- Well, you are not me.

1145
01:06:15,044 --> 01:06:18,415
As I say, it's no skin off my nose.

1146
01:06:21,692 --> 01:06:26,071
But one of these days this bright young man 
is going to be asking George Bailey for a job.

1147
01:06:28,768 --> 01:06:32,346
The Bailey family has been a boil 
on my neck long enough.

1148
01:06:32,346 --> 01:06:33,609
- Yes, sir?
- Come in here.

1149
01:06:34,314 --> 01:06:36,623
We just stopped in town to take a look 
at the new factory, and then

1150
01:06:36,623 --> 01:06:38,642
- we're going to drive on down to Florida.
- Oh...

1151
01:06:38,642 --> 01:06:41,176
- Why don't you have your friends join us?
- Why, sure.

1152
01:06:41,176 --> 01:06:44,093
Hey, why don't you kids drive down 
with us, huh?

1153
01:06:44,093 --> 01:06:46,962
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.

1154
01:06:46,962 --> 01:06:49,028
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh?

1155
01:06:49,028 --> 01:06:53,984
Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground 
floor in plastics and he turned me down cold.

1156
01:06:53,984 --> 01:06:56,743
- Oh, now don't rub it in.
- I'm not rubbing it in.

1157
01:06:56,743 --> 01:06:58,657
Well, I guess we better run along.

1158
01:06:58,657 --> 01:07:00,200
Awfully glad to have met you, Mary.

1159
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:01,204
- Nice meeting you.
- Goodbye.

1160
01:07:01,204 --> 01:07:02,639
- Goodbye, George.
- So long, George.

1161
01:07:02,639 --> 01:07:03,660
- See you in the funny papers.
- Goodbye, Sam.

1162
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:06,004
- So long, Mary.
- So long, Sam. Have fun.

1163
01:07:06,004 --> 01:07:07,084
Thanks for dropping around.

1164
01:07:07,084 --> 01:07:08,882
Florida! 
Hee-haw!

1165
01:07:08,882 --> 01:07:09,944
Hee-haw.    +++++++++++++++++++++++++

1166
01:07:39,277 --> 01:07:40,326
Thank you, sir.

1167
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:42,269
Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.

1168
01:07:42,269 --> 01:07:44,750
You like it? 
I'll send you a box.

1169
01:07:53,431 --> 01:07:57,622
Well, I, uh, I suppose 
I'll find out sooner or later,

1170
01:07:57,622 --> 01:07:59,981
but just what exactly did you want 
to see me about?

1171
01:08:01,738 --> 01:08:06,909
George, now that's just 
what I like so much about you.

1172
01:08:06,909 --> 01:08:10,697
George, I'm an old man, 
and most people hate me.

1173
01:08:10,697 --> 01:08:13,701
But I don't like them, either, 
so that that makes it all even.

1174
01:08:13,701 --> 01:08:18,722
You know, just as well as I do, 
that I run practically everything in this town

1175
01:08:18,722 --> 01:08:21,661
but the Bailey Building and Loan.

1176
01:08:21,661 --> 01:08:26,400
You know, also, that for a number of years 
I've been trying to get control of it or kill it.

1177
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,731
But I haven't been able to do it.

1178
01:08:28,731 --> 01:08:31,729
You have been stopping me.

1179
01:08:31,729 --> 01:08:35,057
In fact, you have beaten me, George,

1180
01:08:35,057 --> 01:08:40,129
and as anyone in this county 
can tell you, that takes some doing.

1181
01:08:40,129 --> 01:08:43,355
Take during the depression, 
for instance.

1182
01:08:43,355 --> 01:08:46,651
You and I were the only ones 
that kept our heads.

1183
01:08:46,651 --> 01:08:50,541
You saved the Building and Loan, 
I saved all the rest.

1184
01:08:50,541 --> 01:08:53,309
Yeah. Well, most people say 
you stole all the rest.

1185
01:08:53,309 --> 01:08:57,593
The envious ones say that, 
George, the suckers.

1186
01:08:57,593 --> 01:09:02,143
Now, I have stated my side very frankly.

1187
01:09:02,143 --> 01:09:05,148
Now, let's look at your side.

1188
01:09:05,148 --> 01:09:12,088
Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, 
married, making say...forty a week.

1189
01:09:12,088 --> 01:09:15,588
- Forty-five!
- Forty-five. Forty-five.

1190
01:09:15,588 --> 01:09:18,105
Out of which, 
after supporting your mother

1191
01:09:18,105 --> 01:09:22,742
and paying your bills, you're able to keep, 
say ten, if you skimp.

1192
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:27,195
A child or two comes along, and you 
won't even be able to save the ten.

1193
01:09:27,195 --> 01:09:31,517
Now, if this young man of twenty-eight 
was a common,

1194
01:09:31,517 --> 01:09:34,526
ordinary yokel, 
I'd say he was doing fine.

1195
01:09:34,526 --> 01:09:38,760
But, George Bailey is not a common, 
ordinary yokel.

1196
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:42,792
He's an intelligent, 
smart, ambitious young man,

1197
01:09:42,792 --> 01:09:48,280
who hates his job, who hates the Building 
and Loan, almost as much as I do.

1198
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:53,218
A young man who's been dying to get 
out on his own ever since he was born.

1199
01:09:53,218 --> 01:09:56,245
A young man...the smartest one 
of the crowd, mind you,

1200
01:09:56,245 --> 01:09:59,700
a young man who has to sit by and 
watch his friends go places,

1201
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:01,399
because he's trapped.

1202
01:10:01,399 --> 01:10:09,318
Yes, sir, trapped into frittering his life away  
playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic-eaters.

1203
01:10:09,318 --> 01:10:12,683
Do I paint a correct picture, 
or do I exaggerate?

1204
01:10:14,958 --> 01:10:16,484
Oh, what's your point, Mr. Potter?

1205
01:10:16,484 --> 01:10:20,056
- My point? My point is, I want to hire you.
- Hire me?

1206
01:10:20,056 --> 01:10:23,796
I want you to manage my affairs, 
run my properties.

1207
01:10:23,796 --> 01:10:28,915
George, I'll start you out at 
twenty thousand dollars a year.

1208
01:10:29,527 --> 01:10:32,826
&nbsp;

1209
01:10:32,826 --> 01:10:35,866
Twenty thous...
twenty thousand dollars a year?

1210
01:10:35,866 --> 01:10:39,335
You wouldn't mind living 
in the nicest house in town,

1211
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:41,968
buying your wife a lot of fine clothes,

1212
01:10:41,968 --> 01:10:46,780
a couple of business trips to New York 
a year, maybe once in a while Europe.

1213
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:48,452
You wouldn't mind that, 
would you, George?

1214
01:10:48,452 --> 01:10:49,889
Would I?

1215
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:54,927
Y-You're not talking to somebody else 
around here, are you?

1216
01:10:54,927 --> 01:10:57,564
you know, th-this is me, you remember me? 
George Bailey.

1217
01:10:57,564 --> 01:11:03,135
Oh, yes, George Bailey. 
Whose ship has just come in,

1218
01:11:03,135 --> 01:11:06,483
provided he has enough brains 
to climb aboard.

1219
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:16,129
Holy mackerel!

1220
01:11:19,172 --> 01:11:21,737
Well, how about the Building and Loan?

1221
01:11:21,737 --> 01:11:25,379
Oh, confound it, man! 
Are you afraid of success?

1222
01:11:25,379 --> 01:11:30,426
I'm offering you a three-year contract at 
twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today.

1223
01:11:30,426 --> 01:11:32,283
Is it a deal, or isn't it?

1224
01:11:33,894 --> 01:11:35,677
Well, Mr. Potter, I...

1225
01:11:35,677 --> 01:11:40,504
I...I know I ought to jump 
at the chance but I...I just, uh,

1226
01:11:40,504 --> 01:11:44,463
I-I wonder if-if it would be possible for you 
to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?

1227
01:11:44,463 --> 01:11:46,332
Sure, sure, sure.

1228
01:11:46,332 --> 01:11:49,066
You go on home 
and talk about it to your wife.

1229
01:11:49,066 --> 01:11:50,679
- I'd like to do that.
- Yeah.

1230
01:11:50,679 --> 01:11:53,002
In the meantime, 
I'll draw up the papers.

1231
01:11:53,002 --> 01:11:55,272
- All right, sir.
- Okay, George?

1232
01:11:56,629 --> 01:11:58,156
Okay, Mr. Potter.

1233
01:12:07,211 --> 01:12:08,437
&nbsp;

1234
01:12:08,437 --> 01:12:11,369
No, no, no, no. Wait a minute here. 
Wait a minute.

1235
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:14,464
I don't need twenty-four hours. 
I, I don't have to talk to anybody.

1236
01:12:14,464 --> 01:12:16,603
I know right now, 
and the answer is no! No!

1237
01:12:16,603 --> 01:12:18,195
Doggone it!

1238
01:12:18,195 --> 01:12:20,785
You sit around here 
and you spin your little webs

1239
01:12:20,785 --> 01:12:22,974
and you think the whole world revolves 
around you and your money.

1240
01:12:22,974 --> 01:12:24,840
Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter.

1241
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:28,062
In the...in the whole 
vast configuration of things,

1242
01:12:28,062 --> 01:12:31,032
I'd say you were nothing 
but a scurvy little spider.

1243
01:12:31,032 --> 01:12:35,801
You...and that goes for you, too.

1244
01:12:39,713 --> 01:12:42,089
And it goes for you, too.

1245
01:12:48,809 --> 01:12:52,324
If you wouldn't mind living 
in the nicest house in town.

1246
01:12:52,324 --> 01:12:55,213
Buying your wife a lot of fine clothes.

1247
01:12:55,213 --> 01:12:58,711
Going to New York on a business trip 
a couple of times a year.

1248
01:12:58,711 --> 01:13:01,276
Maybe to Europe once in a while.

1249
01:13:02,003 --> 01:13:03,886
I know what I'm going to do tomorrow

1250
01:13:03,886 --> 01:13:07,232
and the next day and next year 
and the hear after that.

1251
01:13:07,232 --> 01:13:12,425
I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town  
off my feet, and I'm going to see the world

1252
01:13:12,425 --> 01:13:15,276
and then I'm going to build things. 
I'm going to build air fields.

1253
01:13:15,276 --> 01:13:18,231
I'm going to build skyscrapers 
a hundred stories high.

1254
01:13:18,231 --> 01:13:21,686
I'm going to build a bridge a mile long.

1255
01:13:21,686 --> 01:13:23,450
What is it you want,

1256
01:13:23,450 --> 01:13:25,340
Mary? What? Y-You want the moon?

1257
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:27,900
If you do, just say the word, 
I'll throw a lasso around it

1258
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:29,995
and pulls her down for you.

1259
01:13:29,995 --> 01:13:32,465
Buffalo Gals, 
won't you come out tonight,

1260
01:13:32,465 --> 01:13:35,455
Won't you come out tonight, 
Won't you come out tonight.

1261
01:13:35,455 --> 01:13:38,859
Buffalo Gals, 
won't you come out tonight,

1262
01:13:38,859 --> 01:13:40,910
And...

1263
01:13:47,036 --> 01:13:48,662
- Hi.
- Hi.

1264
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:55,614
Mary Hatch!

1265
01:13:57,975 --> 01:14:02,174
Wh-Why in the world did you 
ever marry a guy like me?

1266
01:14:02,174 --> 01:14:04,715
To keep from being an old maid.

1267
01:14:04,715 --> 01:14:08,792
You could have married Sam Wainwright 
and anybody else in town.

1268
01:14:08,792 --> 01:14:12,223
I didn't want to marry 
anybody else in town.

1269
01:14:12,223 --> 01:14:14,651
I want my baby to look like you.

1270
01:14:14,651 --> 01:14:16,572
You didn't even have a honeymoon.

1271
01:14:16,572 --> 01:14:20,173
I promised you...
your what?

1272
01:14:20,173 --> 01:14:22,787
My baby.

1273
01:14:22,787 --> 01:14:28,075
You...You-You-You-You-You-You-You...
Mary, you're on the nest?

1274
01:14:28,075 --> 01:14:30,790
George Bailey lassoes stork.

1275
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:32,250
Lassoes the stork!

1276
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:36,067
What do you...

1277
01:14:36,067 --> 01:14:38,069
You mean...you-you-you...

1278
01:14:38,069 --> 01:14:40,291
What-what-what is it, 
a boy or a girl?

1279
01:14:40,291 --> 01:14:41,550
Uh-hm.

1280
01:14:43,610 --> 01:14:48,198
Now, you've probably already guessed 
that George never leaves Bedford Falls.

1281
01:14:48,198 --> 01:14:49,222
No!

1282
01:14:49,222 --> 01:14:52,346
Mary had her baby, a boy.

1283
01:14:52,346 --> 01:14:54,841
Then she had another one, a girl.

1284
01:14:54,841 --> 01:15:00,096
Day after day she worked away remaking 
the old Granville house into a home.

1285
01:15:00,096 --> 01:15:03,815
Night after night, 
George came back late from the office.

1286
01:15:07,401 --> 01:15:09,658
Potter was bearing down hard.

1287
01:15:14,838 --> 01:15:16,584
Then came a war.

1288
01:15:17,242 --> 01:15:21,322
Ma Bailey and Mrs. Hatch joined 
the Red Cross and sewed.

1289
01:15:21,322 --> 01:15:25,572
Mary had two more babies but still 
found time to run the U.S.O.

1290
01:15:25,572 --> 01:15:29,566
Sam Wainwright made a fortune 
in plastic hoods for planes.

1291
01:15:29,566 --> 01:15:32,355
Potter became head of the draft board.

1292
01:15:32,355 --> 01:15:40,494
One-A...
one-A...one-A

1293
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:43,315
Gower and Uncle Billy sold war bonds.

1294
01:15:43,315 --> 01:15:47,889
Bert the cop was wounded in 
North Africa, got the Silver Star.

1295
01:15:47,889 --> 01:15:51,746
Ernie, the taxi-driver, 
parachuted into France.

1296
01:15:51,746 --> 01:15:55,179
Marty helped capture the Remagen Bridge.

1297
01:15:55,179 --> 01:15:58,937
Harry, Harry Bailey topped them all.

1298
01:15:58,937 --> 01:16:02,712
A Navy flier, 
he shot down fifteen planes.

1299
01:16:02,712 --> 01:16:07,090
Two of them as they were about to crash 
into a transport full of soldiers.

1300
01:16:08,514 --> 01:16:11,230
- Yes, but George...
- George?

1301
01:16:11,230 --> 01:16:16,405
Four-F on account of his ear, 
George fought the battle of Bedford Falls.

1302
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,543
Hold on, hold on, 
hold on now.

1303
01:16:18,543 --> 01:16:20,185
Don't you know there's a war on?

1304
01:16:20,185 --> 01:16:22,384
Air raid warden...

1305
01:16:30,887 --> 01:16:35,387
paper drives...scrap drives...
rubber drives...

1306
01:16:35,387 --> 01:16:40,963
Like everybody else, 
on V-E day he wept and prayed.

1307
01:16:40,963 --> 01:16:45,726
On V-J day, 
he wept and prayed again.

1308
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:48,254
Joseph, now show him 
what happened today.

1309
01:16:48,254 --> 01:16:49,579
Yes, sir.

1310
01:16:49,579 --> 01:16:54,476
This morning, day before Christmas, 
about ten A.M., Bedford Falls Time.

1311
01:16:54,476 --> 01:16:57,043
Hi, Ernie, 
look at that.

1312
01:17:02,295 --> 01:17:03,393
Gonna snow again.

1313
01:17:03,393 --> 01:17:06,692
What do you mean it's gonna snow? 
Look at the headlines.

1314
01:17:06,692 --> 01:17:09,186
I know, I know, George. 
And it's marvelous.

1315
01:17:09,186 --> 01:17:10,984
Commander Harry Bailey!

1316
01:17:10,984 --> 01:17:12,660
Mr. Gower, look at this.

1317
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:14,724
The second page. 
Now look, this is for you.

1318
01:17:14,724 --> 01:17:16,516
This is for you. 
That's for you.

1319
01:17:16,516 --> 01:17:18,184
- Thanks.
- See you again.

1320
01:17:19,816 --> 01:17:21,973
Be sure you spell the name right.

1321
01:17:21,973 --> 01:17:23,897
Hello, Billy, how are you?

1322
01:17:32,051 --> 01:17:34,783
Extra! 
Extra! Read all about it!

1323
01:17:34,783 --> 01:17:37,113
George! George! It's Harry now 
on long distance from Washington.

1324
01:17:37,113 --> 01:17:40,098
- Harry! What do you know about that!
- He reversed the charges. It's okay, isn't it?

1325
01:17:40,098 --> 01:17:42,748
Reverse the charges...
of course it's for a hero.

1326
01:17:42,748 --> 01:17:44,251
Harry...

1327
01:17:44,251 --> 01:17:47,226
Oh, you old seven times of a son of a gun.

1328
01:17:47,226 --> 01:17:48,513
Congratulations!

1329
01:17:48,513 --> 01:17:50,227
How's mother standing it?

1330
01:17:50,227 --> 01:17:51,659
She did?

1331
01:17:51,659 --> 01:17:52,759
What do you know...

1332
01:17:52,759 --> 01:17:54,340
Mother had lunch with the President's wife.

1333
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:55,619
Wait till Martha hears about this.

1334
01:17:55,619 --> 01:17:57,478
- What did they have to eat?
- Wha-What did they have to eat?

1335
01:17:57,478 --> 01:18:02,276
H-H-Harry, you should see what 
they're cooking up in the town for you.

1336
01:18:02,276 --> 01:18:03,307
Oh, they are?

1337
01:18:03,307 --> 01:18:05,258
The Navy's going to fly mother 
home this afternoon.

1338
01:18:05,258 --> 01:18:07,020
In a plane?

1339
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:09,023
What? 
Uncle Billy?

1340
01:18:09,023 --> 01:18:11,089
- Has Uncle Billy come in yet?
- No, he stopped at the bank first.

1341
01:18:11,089 --> 01:18:13,125
No, he's not here right now, Harry. 
But look...

1342
01:18:13,125 --> 01:18:14,693
- George...
- ...tell me about it.

1343
01:18:14,693 --> 01:18:16,786
...George, tha-that man's here again.

1344
01:18:16,786 --> 01:18:18,472
- What man?
- B-B-Bank...examiner.

1345
01:18:18,472 --> 01:18:19,936
Oh, oh. 
Uh, uh,

1346
01:18:19,936 --> 01:18:22,144
Harry, talk to Eustace for a minute, 
will you?

1347
01:18:22,144 --> 01:18:24,204
I'll be right back. 
Well...

1348
01:18:24,204 --> 01:18:26,206
- Harry...
- Good morning, sir.

1349
01:18:26,206 --> 01:18:27,526
Carter, bank examiner.

1350
01:18:27,526 --> 01:18:29,938
- Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1351
01:18:29,938 --> 01:18:31,781
We're all excited around here.

1352
01:18:31,781 --> 01:18:33,751
My brother just got 
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

1353
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:34,884
The president just decorated him.

1354
01:18:34,884 --> 01:18:36,716
Well, I guess they do those things.

1355
01:18:36,716 --> 01:18:38,498
Well, I trust you had a good year.

1356
01:18:38,498 --> 01:18:39,784
Good year?

1357
01:18:39,784 --> 01:18:43,150
Uh, well, between you and me, 
Mr. Carter, we're broke.

1358
01:18:43,150 --> 01:18:46,669
Yeah, very funny.

1359
01:18:46,669 --> 01:18:49,515
Uh, w-well... 
Now, come right in here, Mr. Carter.

1360
01:18:49,515 --> 01:18:54,061
Oh, I shouldn't wonder when you okay 
reverse charges on personal long distance calls.

1361
01:18:54,061 --> 01:18:55,092
George, shall we hang up?

1362
01:18:55,092 --> 01:18:57,290
No, no. He wants to talk to Uncle Billy. 
You just hold on.

1363
01:18:57,290 --> 01:19:00,161
Now, if you'll cooperate, 
I'd like to finish with you by tonight.

1364
01:19:00,161 --> 01:19:02,998
I want to spend Christmas 
in Elmira with my family.

1365
01:19:02,998 --> 01:19:04,421
I don't blame you at all, Mr. Carter.

1366
01:19:04,421 --> 01:19:06,656
Just step right in here. 
We'll fix you up.

1367
01:19:06,656 --> 01:19:10,432
December twenty-fourth...

1368
01:19:15,641 --> 01:19:18,545
Eight thousand.

1369
01:19:19,205 --> 01:19:21,927
Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter...

1370
01:19:21,927 --> 01:19:24,099
Well, good morning, Mr. Potter?

1371
01:19:24,099 --> 01:19:25,460
What's the news?

1372
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:29,167
Oh, well, well, well. 
Harry Bailey wins Congressional Medal.

1373
01:19:29,167 --> 01:19:31,323
That couldn't be one of the Bailey boys?

1374
01:19:31,323 --> 01:19:34,958
You just can't keep those Baileys down, 
now can you, Mr. Potter.

1375
01:19:34,958 --> 01:19:37,625
How does slacker George feel about that?

1376
01:19:37,625 --> 01:19:38,843
Very jealous. 
Very jealous.

1377
01:19:38,843 --> 01:19:41,169
He only lost three buttons off his vest.

1378
01:19:41,169 --> 01:19:45,369
Of course, slacker George would have gotten 
two of these medals if he had gone.

1379
01:19:45,369 --> 01:19:46,398
Bad ear.

1380
01:19:46,398 --> 01:19:50,617
Yes. After all, Potter, some people 
like George had to stay at home.

1381
01:19:50,617 --> 01:19:54,505
Not every heel was in Germany and Japan.

1382
01:20:02,217 --> 01:20:05,597
- Oh, good morning, Mr. Bailey.
- Good morning, Horace.

1383
01:20:06,918 --> 01:20:09,501
- I guess you forgot something.
- Huh?

1384
01:20:09,501 --> 01:20:11,574
- You forgot something.
- What?

1385
01:20:11,574 --> 01:20:13,999
- Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
- Oh, sure, sure I am.

1386
01:20:13,999 --> 01:20:16,837
Well, then it's usually customary 
to bring the money with you.

1387
01:20:16,837 --> 01:20:21,251
Huh? Oh, shucks...

1388
01:20:21,251 --> 01:20:24,492
Well, I knew I had...

1389
01:20:24,492 --> 01:20:28,378
- How about that finger there?
- Hmm? Well, I...

1390
01:20:28,378 --> 01:20:29,586
Bailey...

1391
01:20:36,277 --> 01:20:38,547
Take me back there. 
Hurry up.

1392
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:42,707
Come on, look sharp.

1393
01:21:00,602 --> 01:21:01,763
Take me back.

1394
01:21:11,892 --> 01:21:15,156
Just make yourself at home, Mr. Carter. 
I'll get those books for you.

1395
01:21:15,156 --> 01:21:16,690
Oh, hello, Vi.

1396
01:21:16,690 --> 01:21:18,367
George, can I see you for a second?

1397
01:21:18,367 --> 01:21:21,426
Why, of course you can. 
Come on in the office here.

1398
01:21:21,426 --> 01:21:23,887
Uncle Billy, talk to Harry. 
He's on the telephone.

1399
01:21:25,004 --> 01:21:27,739
Hurry, Uncle Billy, hurry. 
Long distance, Washington.

1400
01:21:27,739 --> 01:21:28,820
Hey, here's Harry on the phone.

1401
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:30,140
Harry, your nephew, remember?

1402
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:32,641
Here he is. 
Hurry up.

1403
01:21:32,641 --> 01:21:34,361
Hello...hello. Y-Y-Yes, Harry.

1404
01:21:34,361 --> 01:21:36,387
Yes...everything...
everything's fine.

1405
01:21:37,265 --> 01:21:40,053
I should have my head examined. 
Eight thousand dollars.

1406
01:21:40,053 --> 01:21:41,937
It's got to be somewhere.

1407
01:21:48,471 --> 01:21:49,523
Here you are.

1408
01:21:50,083 --> 01:21:51,802
Character?

1409
01:21:51,802 --> 01:21:53,043
If I had any character, I'd...

1410
01:21:53,043 --> 01:21:56,817
It takes a lot of character to leave your 
home town and start all over again.

1411
01:21:56,817 --> 01:21:58,205
No, George, don't...

1412
01:21:58,205 --> 01:22:01,103
- Now here, now you're broke, aren't you?
- I know, but...

1413
01:22:01,103 --> 01:22:03,951
What do you want to do, 
hock your furs and that hat?

1414
01:22:05,408 --> 01:22:06,799
Want to walk to New York?

1415
01:22:06,799 --> 01:22:08,510
You know, they charge for meals 
and rent up there

1416
01:22:08,510 --> 01:22:10,130
just the same as 
they do in Bedford Falls.

1417
01:22:10,130 --> 01:22:12,125
- Yeah, sure.
- It's a loan.

1418
01:22:12,125 --> 01:22:14,755
That's my business. 
Building and Loan.

1419
01:22:14,755 --> 01:22:16,794
Besides, you'll get a job.

1420
01:22:16,794 --> 01:22:17,874
Good luck to you.

1421
01:22:17,874 --> 01:22:20,182
I'm glad I know you, George Bailey.

1422
01:22:25,444 --> 01:22:26,508
Say hello to New York for me.

1423
01:22:26,508 --> 01:22:27,932
Yeah, yeah...sure, I will.

1424
01:22:27,932 --> 01:22:29,685
Now let's hear from you once in a while.

1425
01:22:30,752 --> 01:22:32,026
Hmm.

1426
01:22:34,217 --> 01:22:37,363
- Merry Christmas, Violet.
- Merry Christmas, George.

1427
01:22:38,091 --> 01:22:39,828
- Mr. Bailey.
- Oh, Mr. Carter,

1428
01:22:39,828 --> 01:22:41,279
I'm sorry. 
I'll be right with you.

1429
01:22:41,279 --> 01:22:43,867
- Uncle Billy in?
- Yeah, he's in his office.

1430
01:22:43,867 --> 01:22:46,269
Unc... 
What's going on?

1431
01:22:46,269 --> 01:22:49,021
The bank examiner's here, and I...

1432
01:22:49,021 --> 01:22:50,392
- He's here?
- Yeah, yeah.

1433
01:22:50,392 --> 01:22:52,228
He wants the accounts payable...

1434
01:22:52,228 --> 01:22:55,055
- What's the matter with you?
- Come here.

1435
01:23:15,933 --> 01:23:17,046
- Eustace.
- Yeah?

1436
01:23:17,046 --> 01:23:18,242
Come here a minute.

1437
01:23:19,978 --> 01:23:22,373
Did you see Uncle Billy with 
any cash last night?

1438
01:23:22,373 --> 01:23:24,967
He had it on his desk counting it 
before he closed up.

1439
01:23:25,984 --> 01:23:27,509
Now look, did you buy anything?

1440
01:23:27,509 --> 01:23:29,997
- Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
- All right, all right.

1441
01:23:29,997 --> 01:23:32,321
Now, we'll go over every step you took 
since you left the house.

1442
01:23:32,321 --> 01:23:33,753
All right. This way.

1443
01:23:43,835 --> 01:23:45,735
And did you put the envelope 
in your pocket?

1444
01:23:45,735 --> 01:23:48,663
Yeah...maybe, maybe, maybe...

1445
01:23:48,663 --> 01:23:50,304
Maybe-Maybe! 
I don't want any maybe.

1446
01:23:50,304 --> 01:23:52,051
We've got to find that money!

1447
01:23:52,051 --> 01:23:55,577
- I'm no good to you, George. I...
- Uncle Billy, do you...

1448
01:23:56,725 --> 01:24:01,878
Listen to me.
Do you have any secret place hiding place?

1449
01:24:06,947 --> 01:24:10,262
Listen to me, listen to me! 
Think! Think!

1450
01:24:10,262 --> 01:24:14,308
I can't think anymore, George. 
I can't think anymore. It hurts...

1451
01:24:14,308 --> 01:24:17,334
Where's that money, 
you silly, stupid old fool?!

1452
01:24:17,334 --> 01:24:18,520
Where's that money?

1453
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,249
Do you realize what this means?

1454
01:24:20,249 --> 01:24:23,403
It means bankruptcy 
and scandal, and prison!

1455
01:24:24,386 --> 01:24:25,690
That's what it means.

1456
01:24:25,690 --> 01:24:26,943
One of us is going to jail!

1457
01:24:26,943 --> 01:24:28,911
Well, it's not gonna be me.

1458
01:24:51,885 --> 01:24:52,947
Hello, darling.

1459
01:24:52,947 --> 01:24:54,728
Hello daddy, hello daddy.

1460
01:24:54,728 --> 01:24:56,901
How do you like it? 
We're going to put...

1461
01:24:56,901 --> 01:24:58,824
Bless you!

1462
01:25:00,286 --> 01:25:01,287
Did you bring the wreath?

1463
01:25:01,287 --> 01:25:04,252
- Yes, Daddy, did you bring the Christmas wreath?
- What wreath?

1464
01:25:04,252 --> 01:25:06,823
Oh, that's the Merry Christmas Wreath 
for the window.

1465
01:25:06,823 --> 01:25:08,413
No. I left it at the office.

1466
01:25:08,413 --> 01:25:10,501
- Is it snowing?
- Yeah, just started.

1467
01:25:10,501 --> 01:25:14,076
- Where's your coat and hat?
- Left them at the office.

1468
01:25:14,076 --> 01:25:16,972
- What's the matter?
- Nothing's the matter. Everything's all right.

1469
01:25:25,211 --> 01:25:27,230
Go on, Pete, you're a big boy.

1470
01:25:27,230 --> 01:25:28,469
You can put the star up.

1471
01:25:28,469 --> 01:25:30,479
Way up at the top.

1472
01:25:30,479 --> 01:25:32,240
That's it.

1473
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:33,476
All right.

1474
01:25:33,476 --> 01:25:35,187
Fill in that little bare 
spot right there.

1475
01:25:35,187 --> 01:25:36,441
That's it.

1476
01:25:38,482 --> 01:25:40,470
Isn't it wonderful about Harry?

1477
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:41,844
We're famous, George.

1478
01:25:41,844 --> 01:25:45,874
I'll bet I had fifty calls today 
about the parade, the banquet.

1479
01:25:45,874 --> 01:25:48,169
Your mother's so excited, she...

1480
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:11,064
Must she keep playing that?

1481
01:26:11,064 --> 01:26:13,818
I have to practice it 
for the party tonight, Daddy.

1482
01:26:13,818 --> 01:26:17,064
Mommy says we can stay up till midnight 
and sing Christmas carols.

1483
01:26:17,064 --> 01:26:18,388
Can you sing, Daddy?

1484
01:26:19,012 --> 01:26:20,855
Better hurry and shave.

1485
01:26:20,855 --> 01:26:22,447
The families will be here soon.

1486
01:26:22,447 --> 01:26:25,920
Families! I...I don't want 
the families over here.

1487
01:26:27,873 --> 01:26:31,314
Come on out in the kitchen with me 
while I finish dinner.

1488
01:26:31,314 --> 01:26:34,582
Excuse me. 
Excuse me.

1489
01:26:34,582 --> 01:26:35,785
Have a hectic day?

1490
01:26:35,785 --> 01:26:39,844
Oh, yeah. Another big red-letter day 
for the Bailey's.

1491
01:26:39,844 --> 01:26:42,640
Daddy, the Brown's next door 
have a new car. You should see it.

1492
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:45,087
Well, what's the matter with our car? 
Isn't it good enough for you?

1493
01:26:45,087 --> 01:26:46,442
Yes, Daddy.

1494
01:26:46,442 --> 01:26:48,940
Excuse me. 
Excuse me.

1495
01:26:48,940 --> 01:26:50,279
Excuse you for what?

1496
01:26:50,279 --> 01:26:51,611
I burped!

1497
01:26:52,644 --> 01:26:53,915
All right, darling, you're excused.

1498
01:26:53,915 --> 01:26:56,341
Now go upstairs and see 
what little Zuzu wants.

1499
01:26:57,357 --> 01:26:59,224
Zuzu. 
W-What's the matter with Zuzu?

1500
01:26:59,224 --> 01:27:01,268
Oh, she's got a cold. 
She's in bed.

1501
01:27:01,268 --> 01:27:02,998
Caught it coming home from school.

1502
01:27:02,998 --> 01:27:04,572
They gave her a flower for a prize

1503
01:27:04,572 --> 01:27:06,908
and she didn't want to crush it 
so she didn't button up her coat.

1504
01:27:06,908 --> 01:27:09,102
- What is it, a sore throat or what?
- Just a cold.

1505
01:27:09,102 --> 01:27:10,200
- The doctor says it's nothing serious.
- The doctor?

1506
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,299
- Was the doctor here?
- Yes, I called him right away.

1507
01:27:12,299 --> 01:27:14,044
- He says it's nothing to worry about.
- Is she running a temperature?

1508
01:27:14,044 --> 01:27:16,377
- What is it?
- Just a teensy one, ninety-nine, six.

1509
01:27:16,377 --> 01:27:18,670
- She'll be all right.
- Gosh, it's this old house.

1510
01:27:18,670 --> 01:27:21,049
I don't...I don't know 
why we don't all have pneumonia.

1511
01:27:21,049 --> 01:27:25,773
This drafty old barn! 
Might as well be living in a refrigerator.

1512
01:27:25,773 --> 01:27:30,510
Why did we have to live here in the first place 
and stay around this measly, crummy old town?

1513
01:27:31,542 --> 01:27:32,661
George, what's wrong?

1514
01:27:32,661 --> 01:27:33,884
Wrong? 
Everything's wrong.

1515
01:27:33,884 --> 01:27:35,258
You call this a happy family?

1516
01:27:35,258 --> 01:27:37,565
Why did we have to have all these kids?

1517
01:27:37,565 --> 01:27:38,980
Dad, how do you spell 'frankincense'?

1518
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:41,223
I don't know. 
Why, ask your mother.

1519
01:27:41,223 --> 01:27:43,256
- Where're you going?
- Going up to see Zuzu.

1520
01:27:43,256 --> 01:27:45,391
He told me to write a play for tomorrow.

1521
01:27:56,355 --> 01:28:00,326
F-R-A-N-K-I-N...

1522
01:28:00,326 --> 01:28:01,788
Hi, Daddy.

1523
01:28:02,906 --> 01:28:06,485
- Well, what happened to you?
- I won a flower.

1524
01:28:06,485 --> 01:28:08,250
Wait now. 
W-Where do you think you're going?

1525
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:09,912
Want to give my flower a drink.

1526
01:28:09,912 --> 01:28:12,445
All right, all right, here, 
give Daddy the flower.

1527
01:28:12,445 --> 01:28:15,110
I'll give it a drink. 
All right, here.

1528
01:28:16,602 --> 01:28:21,687
- Look, Daddy...paste it.
- Yeah, all right...

1529
01:28:25,465 --> 01:28:27,570
Now, I'll paste this together.

1530
01:28:31,142 --> 01:28:36,564
Now, there it is, good as new. 
All right, give the flower a drink.

1531
01:28:36,564 --> 01:28:38,932
- Now, will you do something for me?
- What?

1532
01:28:38,932 --> 01:28:40,986
Will you try to get some sleep?

1533
01:28:40,986 --> 01:28:44,046
I'm not sleepy. 
I want to look at my flower.

1534
01:28:44,046 --> 01:28:46,592
I know, I know, 
but you just go to sleep

1535
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:51,049
and then you can dream about it, 
and it'll be a whole garden.

1536
01:28:51,049 --> 01:28:53,226
- It will?
- Uh-huh.

1537
01:29:00,685 --> 01:29:03,826
- Telephone!
- I'll get it.

1538
01:29:06,035 --> 01:29:07,963
Hello.

1539
01:29:07,963 --> 01:29:10,283
Yes, this is Mrs. Bailey.

1540
01:29:10,283 --> 01:29:13,442
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Welch. 
I'm sure she'll be all right.

1541
01:29:13,442 --> 01:29:16,189
The doctor says that she ought to be out 
of bed in time to have her Christmas dinner.

1542
01:29:16,189 --> 01:29:17,861
- Is that Zuzu's teacher?
- Yes.

1543
01:29:17,861 --> 01:29:19,297
Let me speak to her.

1544
01:29:19,297 --> 01:29:22,254
Hello. Hello, Mrs. Welch?

1545
01:29:22,254 --> 01:29:24,752
This is George Bailey. 
I'm Zuzu's father.

1546
01:29:24,752 --> 01:29:26,397
Say, what kind of a teacher are you anyway?

1547
01:29:26,397 --> 01:29:28,807
What do you mean sending her home 
like that, half naked?

1548
01:29:28,807 --> 01:29:30,962
Do you realize she'll probably end up 
with pneumonia on account of you?

1549
01:29:30,962 --> 01:29:32,471
- George!
- Is this the sort of thing

1550
01:29:32,471 --> 01:29:35,487
we pay taxes for - to have teachers...
to have teachers like you?

1551
01:29:35,487 --> 01:29:39,016
Stupid, silly, careless people who send 
our kids home without any clothes on?

1552
01:29:39,016 --> 01:29:41,001
You know, maybe my kids aren't 
the best-dressed kids,

1553
01:29:41,001 --> 01:29:42,799
and maybe they don't have 
any decent clothes...

1554
01:29:42,799 --> 01:29:44,939
Aw, that stupid...

1555
01:29:44,939 --> 01:29:48,428
He-Hello, Mrs. Welch. 
I-I-I want to apologize.

1556
01:29:48,428 --> 01:29:51,231
Hel-lo...hello...

1557
01:29:52,262 --> 01:29:54,834
- She's hung up.
- I-I-I'll hang her up.

1558
01:29:54,834 --> 01:29:56,830
Now, who do you think you are?

1559
01:29:56,830 --> 01:29:58,015
What is that?

1560
01:29:58,015 --> 01:29:59,813
Hello? 
Who is this?

1561
01:29:59,813 --> 01:30:01,817
Oh, Mr. Welch?

1562
01:30:01,817 --> 01:30:03,289
Okay, that's fine, Mr. Welch.

1563
01:30:03,289 --> 01:30:05,472
Gives me a chance to tell you 
what I really think of your wife.

1564
01:30:05,472 --> 01:30:08,464
- George...
- Will you get out and let me handle this?

1565
01:30:08,464 --> 01:30:10,007
Hello?

1566
01:30:10,007 --> 01:30:14,370
Hello? What? 
Oh, you will, huh?

1567
01:30:14,370 --> 01:30:17,404
Okay, Mr. Welch. 
Any time you think you're man enough.

1568
01:30:17,404 --> 01:30:21,103
Hello...any...

1569
01:30:21,103 --> 01:30:22,653
Oh...

1570
01:30:22,653 --> 01:30:24,092
Daddy, how do you spell 
"Hallelujah?"

1571
01:30:24,092 --> 01:30:26,030
How should I know? 
What do you think I am, a dictionary?

1572
01:30:26,030 --> 01:30:27,591
Tommy, stop that! 
Stop it!

1573
01:30:27,591 --> 01:30:30,784
Janie, haven't you leaned that silly tune yet? 
You've played it over and over again.

1574
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:32,530
Now stop it! Stop it!

1575
01:31:00,358 --> 01:31:02,222
I'm sorry, Mary.

1576
01:31:05,182 --> 01:31:06,779
Janie, I'm sorry.

1577
01:31:07,932 --> 01:31:10,069
I didn't mean...

1578
01:31:10,676 --> 01:31:12,697
You go on and practice.

1579
01:31:17,512 --> 01:31:21,374
Pete, I owe you an apology, too.

1580
01:31:21,374 --> 01:31:22,847
I'm sorry.

1581
01:31:24,034 --> 01:31:25,559
What do you want to know?

1582
01:31:25,559 --> 01:31:26,897
Nothing, Daddy.

1583
01:31:33,808 --> 01:31:35,574
What's the matter with everybody?

1584
01:31:35,574 --> 01:31:37,201
Janie, go on. 
I told you to practice.

1585
01:31:37,201 --> 01:31:40,336
- Now, go on, play.
- Oh, Daddy...

1586
01:31:45,085 --> 01:31:46,650
George, why must you torture the children?

1587
01:31:46,650 --> 01:31:47,937
Why don't you...

1588
01:31:49,310 --> 01:31:50,476
Mary...

1589
01:32:04,714 --> 01:32:06,463
Bedford two-four-seven, please.

1590
01:32:06,463 --> 01:32:08,623
- Is Daddy in trouble?
- Yes, Pete.

1591
01:32:08,623 --> 01:32:11,860
- Shall I pray for him?
- Yes, Janie, pray very hard.

1592
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:14,859
- Me, too?
- You, too, Tommy.

1593
01:32:14,859 --> 01:32:17,437
Hello, Uncle Billy?

1594
01:32:17,437 --> 01:32:19,945
I'm in trouble, Mr. Potter.

1595
01:32:19,945 --> 01:32:22,221
I need help.

1596
01:32:22,221 --> 01:32:25,091
Through some sort of an accident 
my company's short in their accounts.

1597
01:32:25,091 --> 01:32:27,111
The bank examiner's got there today.

1598
01:32:27,111 --> 01:32:29,317
I've got to raise eight thousand dollars 
immediately.

1599
01:32:29,317 --> 01:32:31,915
Oh, so that's what the reporters wanted 
to talk to you about?

1600
01:32:31,915 --> 01:32:33,268
- The reporters?
- Yes,

1601
01:32:33,268 --> 01:32:36,992
they called me up 
from your Building and Loan.

1602
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:40,607
Oh, there's a man over there 
from the D.A.'s office, too.

1603
01:32:40,607 --> 01:32:41,808
He's looking for you.

1604
01:32:41,808 --> 01:32:43,778
Please help me, Mr. Potter.

1605
01:32:43,778 --> 01:32:45,472
Help me, won't you, please?

1606
01:32:45,472 --> 01:32:47,373
Can't you see what it means to my family?

1607
01:32:47,373 --> 01:32:50,310
I'll pay any sort of a bonus 
on the loan, any interest

1608
01:32:50,310 --> 01:32:52,050
if you still want the Building and Loan. 
I'm...

1609
01:32:52,050 --> 01:32:55,697
George, could it possibly be 
there's a slight discrepancy in the books?

1610
01:32:55,697 --> 01:32:57,084
No, sir. There's nothing wrong with the books.

1611
01:32:57,084 --> 01:32:58,608
I've just misplaced eight thousand dollars.

1612
01:32:58,608 --> 01:33:00,321
I can't find it anywhere.

1613
01:33:00,321 --> 01:33:03,551
You misplaced eight thousand dollars?

1614
01:33:03,551 --> 01:33:04,657
Yes, sir.

1615
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:09,224
Have you notified the police?

1616
01:33:09,224 --> 01:33:11,036
No, sir. 
I-I didn't want the publicity.

1617
01:33:11,036 --> 01:33:12,862
Harry's homecoming tomorrow...

1618
01:33:12,862 --> 01:33:15,239
They're gonna believe that one.

1619
01:33:15,239 --> 01:33:17,616
What've you been doing, George?

1620
01:33:17,616 --> 01:33:19,313
Playing the market with the company's money?

1621
01:33:19,313 --> 01:33:20,547
No, sir, no, sir. I haven't.

1622
01:33:20,547 --> 01:33:22,569
What is it, a woman then?

1623
01:33:22,569 --> 01:33:26,667
You know, it's all over town that 
you've been giving money to Violet Bick.

1624
01:33:26,667 --> 01:33:29,008
- What!
- Not that it makes any difference to me,

1625
01:33:29,008 --> 01:33:30,268
but why did you come to me?

1626
01:33:30,268 --> 01:33:33,036
Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright 
and ask him for the money?

1627
01:33:33,036 --> 01:33:34,616
I can't get ahold of him. 
He's in Europe.

1628
01:33:34,616 --> 01:33:36,226
Well, what about all your other friends?

1629
01:33:36,226 --> 01:33:38,025
They don't have that kind of money, 
Mr. Potter.

1630
01:33:38,025 --> 01:33:40,478
You know that. You're the only one 
in town that can help me.

1631
01:33:40,478 --> 01:33:42,357
I see.

1632
01:33:42,357 --> 01:33:45,945
I've suddenly become quite important.

1633
01:33:45,945 --> 01:33:48,854
Wha-What kind of security would I have, 
George?

1634
01:33:48,854 --> 01:33:52,146
- Have you got any stocks?
- No, sir.

1635
01:33:52,146 --> 01:33:55,015
Bonds? Real estate? 
Collateral of any kind?

1636
01:33:55,537 --> 01:33:59,838
I have some life insurance, 
a fifteen thousand dollar policy.

1637
01:33:59,838 --> 01:34:02,113
Yes...how much is your equity in it?

1638
01:34:02,113 --> 01:34:05,921
- Five hundred dollars.
- Five hundred dollars!

1639
01:34:05,921 --> 01:34:10,199
And you ask me to lend you eight thousand.

1640
01:34:10,199 --> 01:34:11,347
Look at you.

1641
01:34:11,347 --> 01:34:13,574
You used to be so cocky!

1642
01:34:13,574 --> 01:34:17,175
You were going to go out 
and conquer the world.

1643
01:34:17,175 --> 01:34:22,724
You once called me a warped, 
frustrated old man.

1644
01:34:22,724 --> 01:34:26,634
What are you 
but a warped frustrated young man?

1645
01:34:26,634 --> 01:34:32,043
A miserable little clerk crawling in here 
on your hands and knees and begging for help.

1646
01:34:32,043 --> 01:34:34,142
No securities, no stocks, no bonds,

1647
01:34:34,142 --> 01:34:40,843
nothing but a miserable little five hundred 
dollar equity in a life insurance policy.

1648
01:34:40,843 --> 01:34:43,731
You're worth more dead than alive.

1649
01:34:43,731 --> 01:34:46,910
Why don't you go to the riff-raff 
you love so much

1650
01:34:46,910 --> 01:34:49,839
ask them to let you have eight thousand?

1651
01:34:49,839 --> 01:34:51,057
You know why?

1652
01:34:51,057 --> 01:34:53,793
Because they'd run you out of town 
on a rail.

1653
01:34:53,793 --> 01:34:57,126
But I tell you what I'm going to do 
for you, George.

1654
01:34:57,126 --> 01:35:00,424
Since the state examiner is still here,

1655
01:35:00,424 --> 01:35:03,023
as a stock holder of the Building and Loan,

1656
01:35:03,023 --> 01:35:06,423
I'm going to swear out a warrant 
for your arrest.

1657
01:35:06,423 --> 01:35:11,083
Misappropriation of funds, 
manipulation, malfeasance...

1658
01:35:11,963 --> 01:35:14,477
All right, George, 
go ahead, George.

1659
01:35:14,477 --> 01:35:17,605
You can't hide in a little town like this.

1660
01:35:17,605 --> 01:35:20,050
Bill? 
This is Potter.

1661
01:35:32,867 --> 01:35:35,804
Joe! 
Merry Christmas!

1662
01:35:35,804 --> 01:35:37,451
- Glad you come.
- Thank you.

1663
01:35:37,451 --> 01:35:40,237
- How about some of that good spaghetti?
- We got everything.

1664
01:35:52,017 --> 01:35:53,651
God...

1665
01:35:56,678 --> 01:35:57,928
Oh, God...

1666
01:36:02,763 --> 01:36:04,662
Dear Father in Heaven,

1667
01:36:07,842 --> 01:36:11,943
I'm not a praying man, but 
if you're up there,

1668
01:36:11,943 --> 01:36:17,643
and you can hear me, 
show me the way.

1669
01:36:17,643 --> 01:36:21,788
I'm at the end of my rope. 
I...

1670
01:36:21,788 --> 01:36:24,505
Show me the way, God.

1671
01:36:28,991 --> 01:36:30,364
Are you all right, George?

1672
01:36:30,364 --> 01:36:32,239
Want someone to take you home?

1673
01:36:35,054 --> 01:36:37,455
Why you drink so much, my friend?

1674
01:36:37,455 --> 01:36:41,324
Please go home, Mr. Bailey. 
This is Christmas Eve.

1675
01:36:41,324 --> 01:36:44,552
Bailey? 
Which Bailey?

1676
01:36:44,552 --> 01:36:46,777
This is Mr. George Bailey.

1677
01:36:50,848 --> 01:36:53,679
And the next time you talk to my wife 
like that, you'll get worse.

1678
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:55,182
She cried for an hour.

1679
01:36:55,182 --> 01:36:57,652
It isn't enough she slaves 
teaching your stupid kids

1680
01:36:57,652 --> 01:36:59,598
how to read and write, and you 
have to bawl her out,eh.

1681
01:36:59,598 --> 01:37:00,838
You get out of here, Mr. Welch!

1682
01:37:00,838 --> 01:37:02,357
Now wait. 
I want to pay for my drink.

1683
01:37:02,357 --> 01:37:04,309
Never mind the money. 
You get out of here quick.

1684
01:37:04,309 --> 01:37:07,427
- All right.
- You hit my best friend. Get out!

1685
01:37:12,701 --> 01:37:14,460
You all right, George?

1686
01:37:14,460 --> 01:37:15,629
Who was that?

1687
01:37:15,629 --> 01:37:17,830
He gone. 
No worry.

1688
01:37:17,830 --> 01:37:20,457
His name is Welch. 
He no come in to my place no more.

1689
01:37:20,457 --> 01:37:23,753
Oh, Welch. 
That's what I get for praying.

1690
01:37:23,753 --> 01:37:25,785
The last time he come in here. 
You hear that, Nick?

1691
01:37:25,785 --> 01:37:26,993
Yes, you bet.

1692
01:37:26,993 --> 01:37:30,663
Where's my insurance policy? 
Oh, here.

1693
01:37:30,663 --> 01:37:32,518
- Oh, no, please, no go out this way, Mr. Bailey.
- I'm all right.

1694
01:37:32,518 --> 01:37:34,660
No, no, you no feel so good. 
Sit down and rest.

1695
01:37:34,660 --> 01:37:37,592
- I'm all right.
- Please no go away. Please!

1696
01:37:56,169 --> 01:37:57,475
What do you think you're doing?

1697
01:38:00,570 --> 01:38:02,028
Now look what you did.

1698
01:38:02,028 --> 01:38:04,343
My great-grandfather planted this tree.

1699
01:38:05,272 --> 01:38:07,343
Hey, you! Hey, you!

1700
01:38:08,018 --> 01:38:09,809
Come back here, you drunken fool!

1701
01:38:09,809 --> 01:38:11,640
Get this car out of here!

1702
01:38:19,737 --> 01:38:21,946
Hey, what's the matter with you? 
Look where you're going!

1703
01:39:10,166 --> 01:39:11,624
Help!

1704
01:39:12,879 --> 01:39:17,447
Help! Help! Help!

1705
01:39:19,180 --> 01:39:21,772
Help! Help!

1706
01:39:23,501 --> 01:39:25,753
Help!

1707
01:39:28,012 --> 01:39:32,382
Help! Help! Help! Help!

1708
01:39:34,556 --> 01:39:35,920
Help!

1709
01:39:37,038 --> 01:39:41,153
Help! Help! Help!

1710
01:39:57,506 --> 01:39:59,798
I didn't have time to get 
some stylish underwear.

1711
01:39:59,798 --> 01:40:02,258
My wife gave me this on my last birthday.

1712
01:40:03,306 --> 01:40:05,148
I passed away in it.

1713
01:40:08,617 --> 01:40:11,326
Oh, Tom Sawyer's drying out, too.

1714
01:40:14,728 --> 01:40:17,523
You should read the new book 
Mark Twain's writing now.

1715
01:40:18,753 --> 01:40:20,718
How did you happen to fall in?

1716
01:40:20,718 --> 01:40:24,254
I didn't fall in. 
I jumped in to save George.

1717
01:40:24,254 --> 01:40:27,343
You what? 
To...to save me?

1718
01:40:27,343 --> 01:40:30,530
Well, I did, didn't I? 
You didn't go through with it, did you?

1719
01:40:30,530 --> 01:40:32,747
- Go through with what?
- Suicide.

1720
01:40:32,747 --> 01:40:35,932
Well, it's against the law 
to commit suicide around here.

1721
01:40:35,932 --> 01:40:38,802
Yeah, it's against the law 
where I come from, too.

1722
01:40:38,802 --> 01:40:41,590
- Where do you come from?
- Heaven.

1723
01:40:46,355 --> 01:40:49,379
I had to act quickly. 
That's why I jumped in.

1724
01:40:49,379 --> 01:40:51,896
I knew if I were drowning 
you'd try to save me.

1725
01:40:51,896 --> 01:40:55,048
And you see, you did, 
and that's how I saved you.

1726
01:40:55,048 --> 01:40:57,220
Very funny.

1727
01:40:57,220 --> 01:40:59,290
Your lip's bleeding, George.

1728
01:40:59,290 --> 01:41:03,579
Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw in answer 
to a prayer a little bit ago.

1729
01:41:03,579 --> 01:41:07,457
Oh, no, no, no, George, 
I'm the answer to your prayer.

1730
01:41:07,457 --> 01:41:09,491
That's why I was sent down here.

1731
01:41:10,353 --> 01:41:11,833
How do you know my name?

1732
01:41:11,833 --> 01:41:15,420
Oh, I know all about you. 
I've watched you grow up from a little boy.

1733
01:41:15,420 --> 01:41:18,293
- What are you, a mind reader or something?
- Oh, no.

1734
01:41:18,293 --> 01:41:22,897
- Well, who are you then?
- Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.

1735
01:41:22,897 --> 01:41:27,607
Odbody...A-S-2. 
Wh-Wh-What's that A-S-2?

1736
01:41:27,607 --> 01:41:29,149
Angel Second Class.

1737
01:41:39,805 --> 01:41:41,502
Cheerio, my good man.

1738
01:41:45,689 --> 01:41:47,162
Oh, brother...

1739
01:41:51,903 --> 01:41:54,088
I wonder what Martini put in those drinks?

1740
01:41:56,621 --> 01:41:59,000
Hey, what's... with you...

1741
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,446
wh-wh-what-did you say just a minute ago?

1742
01:42:01,446 --> 01:42:03,125
Why'd you want to save me?

1743
01:42:03,125 --> 01:42:07,259
That's what I was sent down for. 
I'm your guardian angel.

1744
01:42:07,259 --> 01:42:09,398
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

1745
01:42:09,398 --> 01:42:12,511
Ridiculous of you to think of killing 
yourself for money.

1746
01:42:12,511 --> 01:42:15,260
- Eight thousand dollars.
- Yeah, I'll say. Just things like that.

1747
01:42:15,260 --> 01:42:16,974
Now how do you know that?

1748
01:42:16,974 --> 01:42:18,804
I told you. 
I'm your guardian angel.

1749
01:42:18,804 --> 01:42:20,635
I know everything about you.

1750
01:42:21,974 --> 01:42:25,203
Well, you look about like the kind of 
an angel I'd get.

1751
01:42:25,203 --> 01:42:27,052
Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you?

1752
01:42:27,052 --> 01:42:28,220
What happened to your wings?

1753
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:31,864
I haven't won my wings yet. 
That's why I'm an angel second class.

1754
01:42:36,632 --> 01:42:40,064
I don't know whether I like it very much being 
seen around with an angel without any wings.

1755
01:42:40,064 --> 01:42:43,846
Oh, I-I've got to earn them 
and you'll help me, won't you?

1756
01:42:43,846 --> 01:42:48,674
- Sure, sure. How?
- By letting me help you.

1757
01:42:50,353 --> 01:42:51,424
Only one way you can help me.

1758
01:42:51,424 --> 01:42:53,478
Y-You don't happen to have 
eight thousand bucks on you?

1759
01:42:53,478 --> 01:42:56,086
Oh, no, no. 
We don't use money in heaven.

1760
01:42:56,086 --> 01:42:59,369
Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting.

1761
01:42:59,369 --> 01:43:01,304
Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.

1762
01:43:01,304 --> 01:43:04,075
Oh, tut, tut, tut.

1763
01:43:04,075 --> 01:43:06,674
I found it out a little late.

1764
01:43:06,674 --> 01:43:08,798
I'm worth more dead than alive.

1765
01:43:08,798 --> 01:43:13,034
Now look, you mustn't talk like that. 
I won't get my wings with that attitude.

1766
01:43:13,034 --> 01:43:15,564
You just don't know all that you've done.

1767
01:43:15,564 --> 01:43:16,767
If it hadn't been for you...

1768
01:43:16,767 --> 01:43:19,666
Yeah, if it hadn't been for me, 
everybody'd be a lot better off.

1769
01:43:19,666 --> 01:43:21,734
My wife, and my kids, and my friends.

1770
01:43:21,734 --> 01:43:25,047
And my... Look, little fellow, why, you go off 
and haunt somebody else, will you?

1771
01:43:25,047 --> 01:43:27,833
No, no, you don't understand. 
I've got my job.

1772
01:43:27,833 --> 01:43:29,647
Aw, shut up, will you?

1773
01:43:33,834 --> 01:43:36,911
Hmmm, this isn't gonna be so easy.

1774
01:43:41,286 --> 01:43:46,183
Yeah! So you still think killing yourself 
would make everyone feel happier, eh?

1775
01:43:47,626 --> 01:43:50,052
Oh, I don't know. 
I guess you're right.

1776
01:43:51,749 --> 01:43:54,775
I suppose it would have been better 
if I'd never been born at all.

1777
01:43:54,775 --> 01:43:58,218
- What'd you say?
- I said I wish I'd never been born.

1778
01:43:58,218 --> 01:44:01,127
Oh, you mustn't say things like that.

1779
01:44:01,127 --> 01:44:02,448
You...

1780
01:44:02,448 --> 01:44:04,621
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1781
01:44:04,621 --> 01:44:06,783
That's an idea.

1782
01:44:06,783 --> 01:44:11,531
What do you think? Yeah, that'll do it.

1783
01:44:11,531 --> 01:44:12,651
All right.

1784
01:44:15,646 --> 01:44:17,410
You've got your wish.

1785
01:44:17,410 --> 01:44:19,131
You've never been born.

1786
01:44:24,229 --> 01:44:26,603
You don't have to make 
all that fuss about it.

1787
01:44:28,385 --> 01:44:29,803
What did you say?

1788
01:44:29,803 --> 01:44:32,369
You've never been born. 
You don't exist.

1789
01:44:32,369 --> 01:44:33,674
You haven't a care in the world.

1790
01:44:33,674 --> 01:44:37,195
No worries, no obligations, 
no eight thousand dollars to get,

1791
01:44:37,195 --> 01:44:39,028
no Potter looking for you with the sheriff.

1792
01:44:39,028 --> 01:44:41,874
- Say something else in that ear.
- Sure. You can hear out of it.

1793
01:44:42,617 --> 01:44:44,946
Well, that's the doggonedest thing.

1794
01:44:44,946 --> 01:44:47,417
I haven't heard anything out of that ear 
since I was a kid.

1795
01:44:47,417 --> 01:44:49,674
Must have been that jump in 
that cold water.

1796
01:44:49,674 --> 01:44:51,912
Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, George.

1797
01:44:57,249 --> 01:44:58,774
What do you know about that?

1798
01:44:59,927 --> 01:45:00,991
What's happened?

1799
01:45:02,279 --> 01:45:04,670
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it?

1800
01:45:04,670 --> 01:45:07,285
Well, I, uh...
What's happened here?

1801
01:45:07,285 --> 01:45:09,083
What I need is a couple of 
good stiff drinks.

1802
01:45:09,083 --> 01:45:11,137
How about you, angel, 
you want a drink?

1803
01:45:13,175 --> 01:45:15,211
Come on, soon as 
these clothes of ours are dry...

1804
01:45:15,211 --> 01:45:17,445
Those are dry.

1805
01:45:17,445 --> 01:45:19,074
What do you know about that?

1806
01:45:19,074 --> 01:45:20,380
Stove's hotter than I thought.

1807
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:23,798
Now, come on, get your clothes on, 
and we'll stroll up to my car and get...

1808
01:45:23,798 --> 01:45:26,907
Oh, I'm sorry. 
I'll stroll, you fly.

1809
01:45:26,907 --> 01:45:28,687
I can't fly. 
I haven't got my wings.

1810
01:45:28,687 --> 01:45:30,519
You haven't got your wings. 
Yeah, that's right.

1811
01:45:37,126 --> 01:45:38,398
What's the matter?

1812
01:45:38,398 --> 01:45:41,269
Well, this is where I left my car and it isn't here.

1813
01:45:41,269 --> 01:45:42,523
You have no car.

1814
01:45:42,523 --> 01:45:46,298
Well, I had a car and it was right here. 
I guess somebody moved it.

1815
01:45:46,298 --> 01:45:49,008
- Good evening.
- Oh, say...Hey...

1816
01:45:49,008 --> 01:45:50,698
wh-where's my car.

1817
01:45:50,698 --> 01:45:52,674
- I beg your pardon?
- My car, my car.

1818
01:45:52,674 --> 01:45:55,155
I'm the fellow that owns the car 
that ran into your tree.

1819
01:45:55,155 --> 01:45:57,200
What tree?
What do you mean, what tree?

1820
01:45:57,200 --> 01:45:59,458
This tree. Here. 
I ran into it.

1821
01:45:59,458 --> 01:46:03,299
Cut a big gash in the side of it there.

1822
01:46:06,993 --> 01:46:09,354
You must mean two other trees.

1823
01:46:09,354 --> 01:46:10,591
You had me worried.

1824
01:46:10,591 --> 01:46:12,833
One of the oldest trees in Pottersville.

1825
01:46:12,833 --> 01:46:15,706
Pottersville. 
Why, you mean Bedford Falls.

1826
01:46:15,706 --> 01:46:17,574
I mean Pottersville.

1827
01:46:17,574 --> 01:46:19,526
Don't you think I know where I live?

1828
01:46:19,526 --> 01:46:20,818
What's the matter with you?

1829
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:30,770
Oh, I don't know. 
Either I'm off my nut, or he is.

1830
01:46:30,770 --> 01:46:31,978
...or you are.

1831
01:46:32,754 --> 01:46:34,217
It isn't me!

1832
01:46:34,217 --> 01:46:37,834
Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini's. 
Well, come on, Gabriel.

1833
01:46:37,834 --> 01:46:40,071
- Clarence!
- Clarence! Clarence!

1834
01:46:46,135 --> 01:46:47,171
That's all right. 
Go on in.

1835
01:46:47,171 --> 01:46:50,301
Martini is a friend of mine.

1836
01:46:50,301 --> 01:46:52,235
There's a place to sit down, sit down.

1837
01:46:59,287 --> 01:47:01,916
Oh, hello, Nick. 
Hey, where's Martini?

1838
01:47:01,916 --> 01:47:03,808
- You want a Martini?
- No, no, Martini.

1839
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:06,144
- Your boss. Where is he?
- Look, I'm the boss.

1840
01:47:06,144 --> 01:47:07,448
You want a drink or don't you?

1841
01:47:07,448 --> 01:47:09,811
Okay, all right. Double bourbon, will you? 
Quick, huh.

1842
01:47:09,811 --> 01:47:10,997
Okay.

1843
01:47:14,213 --> 01:47:15,790
What's yours?

1844
01:47:15,790 --> 01:47:17,384
I was just thinking.

1845
01:47:17,384 --> 01:47:21,093
Uh...It's been so long 
since I...

1846
01:47:21,093 --> 01:47:24,630
Look, Mister, I'm standing here waiting 
for you to make up your mind.

1847
01:47:24,630 --> 01:47:26,276
That's a good man.

1848
01:47:26,276 --> 01:47:32,984
I was just thinking, uh, 
of a flaming rum punch.

1849
01:47:32,984 --> 01:47:35,478
No, it's not cold enough for that. 
Not nearly cold enough.

1850
01:47:35,478 --> 01:47:36,745
Wait a minute. 
Wait a minute.

1851
01:47:36,745 --> 01:47:38,664
I got it.

1852
01:47:38,664 --> 01:47:42,284
Mulled wine, heavy on the cinnamon 
and light on the cloves.

1853
01:47:42,284 --> 01:47:44,236
Off with you, me lad, and be lively!

1854
01:47:44,236 --> 01:47:49,205
Hey, look, Mister, we serve hard drinks 
in here for men who want to get drunk fast.

1855
01:47:49,205 --> 01:47:54,034
And we don't need any characters around 
to give the joint atmosphere. Is that clear?

1856
01:47:54,034 --> 01:47:56,719
Or do I have to slip you 
my left for a convincer?

1857
01:47:56,719 --> 01:47:57,863
What's he talking about?

1858
01:47:57,863 --> 01:48:03,359
Nick, Nick, just give him the same as mine. 
He's okay.

1859
01:48:03,359 --> 01:48:04,557
Okay.

1860
01:48:05,965 --> 01:48:07,409
What's the matter with him?

1861
01:48:07,409 --> 01:48:09,563
I never saw Nick act like that before.

1862
01:48:09,563 --> 01:48:12,982
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.

1863
01:48:12,982 --> 01:48:14,425
Oh, yeah.

1864
01:48:15,731 --> 01:48:21,162
Hey, li-li-little fellow, you worry me.

1865
01:48:21,162 --> 01:48:24,658
- You know, y-y-you got someplace to sleep?
- No.

1866
01:48:24,658 --> 01:48:26,304
You don't, huh?

1867
01:48:26,304 --> 01:48:29,892
- Well, y-y-you got any money?
- No.

1868
01:48:29,892 --> 01:48:31,479
No wonder you jumped in the river.

1869
01:48:31,479 --> 01:48:35,082
I jumped in the river to save you 
so I could get my wings.

1870
01:48:35,082 --> 01:48:37,124
- Oh, that's right.
- Oh-oh.

1871
01:48:39,129 --> 01:48:41,221
- Somebody's just made it.
- Made what?

1872
01:48:41,221 --> 01:48:45,730
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means 
that some angel's just got his wings.

1873
01:48:51,060 --> 01:48:58,397
Look, I think maybe you better not 
mention getting your wings around here.

1874
01:48:58,397 --> 01:49:00,963
Why? 
Don't they believe in angels?

1875
01:49:00,963 --> 01:49:04,557
A... Yeah, 
they believe in angels.

1876
01:49:04,557 --> 01:49:07,428
Oh, oh! Why should they be surprised 
when they see one?

1877
01:49:10,183 --> 01:49:13,909
Aw, he never grew up. He's...

1878
01:49:13,909 --> 01:49:15,862
How old are you, anyway, Clarence?

1879
01:49:15,862 --> 01:49:21,122
Two hundred and ninety-three, 
uh, next May.

1880
01:49:21,781 --> 01:49:23,237
That does it!

1881
01:49:23,237 --> 01:49:26,671
Out you two pixies go, 
through the door or out the window.

1882
01:49:26,671 --> 01:49:27,891
Look, Nick, what's wrong?

1883
01:49:27,891 --> 01:49:30,866
And that's another thing. 
Where do you come off calling me Nick?

1884
01:49:30,866 --> 01:49:32,410
Well, Nick, that's your name.

1885
01:49:32,410 --> 01:49:36,699
What's that got to do with it? 
I don't know you from Adam's off ox.

1886
01:49:36,699 --> 01:49:39,299
Hey! Hey, you, rummy there! 
Come here! Come here!

1887
01:49:43,097 --> 01:49:46,214
Didn't I tell you never to come 
panhandling around here, huh?

1888
01:49:53,767 --> 01:49:55,163
Mr. Gower!

1889
01:49:56,350 --> 01:49:57,584
Mr. Gower!

1890
01:49:59,317 --> 01:50:01,423
What...what is he...

1891
01:50:01,423 --> 01:50:03,853
Mr. Gower! 
This is George Bailey!

1892
01:50:05,176 --> 01:50:10,218
- Don't you know me?
- No. No.

1893
01:50:10,218 --> 01:50:11,709
Throw 'em out. 
Throw 'em out!

1894
01:50:11,709 --> 01:50:14,908
Mr. Gower...
Hey, what is...

1895
01:50:14,908 --> 01:50:17,286
Hey, Nick, Nick... 
Isn't that Mr. Gower, the druggist?

1896
01:50:17,286 --> 01:50:19,425
You know, that's another reason 
for me not to like you.

1897
01:50:19,425 --> 01:50:22,963
That rum head spent twenty years 
in jail for poisoning a kid.

1898
01:50:22,963 --> 01:50:25,409
If you know him, you must be 
a jailbird yourself.

1899
01:50:25,409 --> 01:50:28,110
Uh, would you show these 
gentlemen to the door?

1900
01:50:28,110 --> 01:50:30,064
Sure. 
This way, gentlemen.

1901
01:50:35,821 --> 01:50:37,717
Stay out! Stay out!

1902
01:50:37,717 --> 01:50:38,952
Hey! 
Get me!

1903
01:50:39,422 --> 01:50:40,914
I'm giving out wings!

1904
01:50:43,413 --> 01:50:45,039
You see, George, you were not there

1905
01:50:45,039 --> 01:50:47,572
to stop Gower from putting 
that poison into the capsule...

1906
01:50:47,572 --> 01:50:48,827
What do you mean I wasn't there?

1907
01:50:48,827 --> 01:50:53,539
I remember distinctly. 
What the...

1908
01:50:53,539 --> 01:50:56,361
hey, what's going on around here?

1909
01:50:56,361 --> 01:51:01,061
Why, this ought to be Martini's place.

1910
01:51:07,445 --> 01:51:09,237
Look, who are you?

1911
01:51:09,237 --> 01:51:11,876
I told you, George. 
I'm your guardian angel.

1912
01:51:11,876 --> 01:51:13,564
Yeah, yeah, I know. 
You told me that.

1913
01:51:19,747 --> 01:51:21,964
What else are you? 
What are you?

1914
01:51:21,964 --> 01:51:24,070
- You are hypnotist?
- No, of course not.

1915
01:51:24,070 --> 01:51:26,940
Well, then why am I seeing 
all these strange things?

1916
01:51:26,940 --> 01:51:29,131
Don't you understand, George?

1917
01:51:29,131 --> 01:51:31,407
It's because you were not born.

1918
01:51:31,407 --> 01:51:33,139
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?

1919
01:51:33,139 --> 01:51:35,967
You're nobody. 
You have no identity.

1920
01:51:35,967 --> 01:51:38,394
Oh, what do you mean, no identity? 
My name's George Bailey.

1921
01:51:38,394 --> 01:51:40,450
There is no George Bailey.

1922
01:51:41,755 --> 01:51:50,266
You have no papers, no cards, no driver's 
license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy.

1923
01:51:50,266 --> 01:51:52,068
They're not there, either.

1924
01:51:53,478 --> 01:51:56,354
- What?
- Zuzu's petals.

1925
01:52:01,359 --> 01:52:04,197
You've been given a great gift, George...

1926
01:52:04,197 --> 01:52:07,599
a chance to see what the world 
would be like without you.

1927
01:52:10,112 --> 01:52:13,016
Now wait a minute here. 
Wait a minute here.

1928
01:52:14,697 --> 01:52:18,098
Aw, this is some sort of a funny dream 
I'm having here.

1929
01:52:18,098 --> 01:52:20,015
So long, Mister, I-I'm going home.

1930
01:52:20,015 --> 01:52:22,569
- Home? What home?
- Now shut up! Cut it out!

1931
01:52:23,415 --> 01:52:26,127
You're...You're...You're crazy. 
That's what I think.

1932
01:52:26,127 --> 01:52:29,229
You're...You're screwy 
and you're driving me crazy, too!

1933
01:52:29,229 --> 01:52:30,637
I'm seeing things here.

1934
01:52:30,637 --> 01:52:32,676
I'm going home and see my wife and family.

1935
01:52:32,676 --> 01:52:35,049
You understand that? 
And I'm going home alone!

1936
01:52:38,301 --> 01:52:41,785
How am I doing, Joseph? 
Thanks.

1937
01:52:42,420 --> 01:52:44,134
No, I didn't have a drink!

1938
01:53:34,916 --> 01:53:36,747
Hey, hey.

1939
01:53:36,747 --> 01:53:39,289
- Where did the Building and Loan move to?
- The building and what?

1940
01:53:39,289 --> 01:53:40,985
The Bailey Building and Loan. 
It was up there.

1941
01:53:40,985 --> 01:53:43,186
They went out of business years ago.

1942
01:53:43,186 --> 01:53:44,966
That guy is a liar!

1943
01:53:44,966 --> 01:53:46,972
I know everything's shot in this town.

1944
01:53:46,972 --> 01:53:51,092
- I know...
- Hey, Violet.

1945
01:53:52,330 --> 01:53:55,134
Hey, listen, that's Violet Bick!

1946
01:53:55,134 --> 01:53:57,248
- I know. I know.
- I know that girl.

1947
01:53:57,248 --> 01:53:58,823
Take a walk. 
Beat it.

1948
01:54:01,153 --> 01:54:03,002
Hey, Ernie, Ernie...

1949
01:54:04,991 --> 01:54:07,139
Ernie, take me home. 
I've gone off my nut!

1950
01:54:07,139 --> 01:54:08,692
- Where do you live?
- Aw, now, doggone it,

1951
01:54:08,692 --> 01:54:10,130
Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff.

1952
01:54:10,130 --> 01:54:12,055
You know where I live. 
Three-twenty Sycamore.

1953
01:54:12,055 --> 01:54:14,603
- Now hurry up.
- Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore?

1954
01:54:14,603 --> 01:54:17,750
- Yeah, yeah, hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
- All right. All right.

1955
01:54:18,814 --> 01:54:20,886
Look here, Ernie, straighten me out here.

1956
01:54:20,886 --> 01:54:22,620
Look, I-I've got some bad liquor 
or something.

1957
01:54:22,620 --> 01:54:25,079
I want you to listen to me. 
Now, you are Ernie Bishop,

1958
01:54:25,079 --> 01:54:28,018
and you live in Bailey Park with your 
wife and kid? That's right, isn't it?

1959
01:54:28,018 --> 01:54:29,101
You seen my wife?

1960
01:54:29,101 --> 01:54:32,592
Seen your wife! 
I've been to your house a hundred times.

1961
01:54:32,592 --> 01:54:33,880
Look, bud, what's the idea?

1962
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:37,548
I live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife 
ran away three years ago and took the kid...

1963
01:54:37,548 --> 01:54:40,165
And I ain't never seen you 
before in my life, see?

1964
01:54:40,165 --> 01:54:42,617
Okay. Just step on it. 
Just get me home.

1965
01:55:00,734 --> 01:55:02,768
- Is this the place?
- Of course, it's the place.

1966
01:55:02,768 --> 01:55:05,534
Well, this house ain't been lived 
in for twenty years.

1967
01:55:12,142 --> 01:55:13,245
What's up, Ernie?

1968
01:55:13,245 --> 01:55:15,638
I don't know, but we'd better keep 
our eye on this guy.

1969
01:55:15,638 --> 01:55:16,648
He's bats.

1970
01:55:34,809 --> 01:55:37,209
Mary! 
Mary!

1971
01:55:40,031 --> 01:55:43,322
Tommy! Pete! Janie! Zuzu! 
Where are you?

1972
01:55:43,322 --> 01:55:46,091
They're not here, George. 
You have no children.

1973
01:55:46,091 --> 01:55:47,498
Where are they? 
What have you done with them?

1974
01:55:47,498 --> 01:55:49,798
All right, put up your hands. 
No fast moves.

1975
01:55:49,798 --> 01:55:51,383
Come on out here, 
both of you.

1976
01:55:51,383 --> 01:55:53,027
Bert! 
Thank heaven, you're here.

1977
01:55:53,027 --> 01:55:55,721
- Stand back!
- Bert, what's happened to this house?

1978
01:55:55,721 --> 01:55:57,248
Wh-Where's Mary? 
Where's my kids?

1979
01:55:57,248 --> 01:55:58,343
Watch him, Bert.

1980
01:55:58,343 --> 01:55:59,663
- Come on, come on.
- Bert, Ernie!

1981
01:55:59,663 --> 01:56:01,119
What's the matter with you two guys?

1982
01:56:01,119 --> 01:56:02,867
You-You-You were here on my wedding night.

1983
01:56:02,867 --> 01:56:05,824
You, both of you, stood out there on the porch 
and sung to us, don't you remember?

1984
01:56:05,824 --> 01:56:06,957
- Think I'd better be going.
- Look,

1985
01:56:06,957 --> 01:56:09,251
now why don't you be a good kid 
and we'll take you into a doctor.

1986
01:56:09,251 --> 01:56:11,054
- Everything's gonna be all right. Now...
- Bert, now listen to me.

1987
01:56:11,054 --> 01:56:13,283
Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house?

1988
01:56:13,283 --> 01:56:14,876
Bert! Listen! 
It's that fellow there.

1989
01:56:14,876 --> 01:56:17,079
He says he's an angel. 
He's tried to hypnotize me.

1990
01:56:17,079 --> 01:56:19,117
I hate to do this, fella, but...

1991
01:56:20,786 --> 01:56:22,555
Run, George! 
Run, George!

1992
01:56:22,555 --> 01:56:26,373
Help! 
Joseph, help!

1993
01:56:26,373 --> 01:56:31,084
- Oh, shut up!
- Help, oh, Joseph, Joseph!

1994
01:56:36,736 --> 01:56:39,673
Where'd he go? Where'd he go? 
I had him right here.

1995
01:56:42,786 --> 01:56:43,884
I need a drink.

1996
01:56:44,799 --> 01:56:46,919
Well, which way'd they go? 
Help me find 'em.

1997
01:56:57,391 --> 01:56:58,657
Well?

1998
01:57:01,872 --> 01:57:02,937
Mother.

1999
01:57:04,959 --> 01:57:06,990
Mother? 
What do you want?

2000
01:57:08,127 --> 01:57:12,965
Mother, this is, this is George. 
I...I thought sure you'd remember me.

2001
01:57:12,965 --> 01:57:14,522
George who?

2002
01:57:14,522 --> 01:57:16,043
If you're looking for a room, 
there's no vacancy.

2003
01:57:16,043 --> 01:57:18,199
Oh, Mother, listen. 
Please help me.

2004
01:57:18,199 --> 01:57:19,473
Something terrible's happened to me.

2005
01:57:19,473 --> 01:57:22,263
I-I-I don't know what it is. 
Something's happened to everybody.

2006
01:57:22,263 --> 01:57:23,895
Please let me come in.

2007
01:57:23,895 --> 01:57:26,355
- Keep me here until I get over it.
- Get over what?

2008
01:57:26,355 --> 01:57:29,773
I don't take in strangers unless 
they're sent here by somebody I know.

2009
01:57:29,773 --> 01:57:33,540
What? 
Look, I know everybody you know.

2010
01:57:33,540 --> 01:57:35,717
What do you... 
Your brother-in-law, Uncle Billy.

2011
01:57:35,717 --> 01:57:37,581
- You know him?
- Well, sure I do.

2012
01:57:37,581 --> 01:57:39,874
- When'd you see him last?
- Today over at his house.

2013
01:57:39,874 --> 01:57:40,992
That's a lie.

2014
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:44,000
He's been in the insane asylum 
ever since he lost his business.

2015
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,870
And if you ask me, that's where you belong.

2016
01:57:58,806 --> 01:58:00,913
Strange, isn't it?

2017
01:58:00,913 --> 01:58:04,383
Each man's life touches so many other lives

2018
01:58:04,383 --> 01:58:07,326
and when he isn't around he leaves 
an awful hole, doesn't he?

2019
01:58:07,326 --> 01:58:08,510
I've heard of things like this.

2020
01:58:08,510 --> 01:58:10,240
You've got me in some kind of a spell, 
or something.

2021
01:58:10,240 --> 01:58:12,668
Well, I'm going to get out of it. 
I'll get out of it.

2022
01:58:12,668 --> 01:58:14,740
I know how, too. 
I...

2023
01:58:14,740 --> 01:58:18,306
The last man I talked to before all this 
stuff started happening to me was Martini.

2024
01:58:18,306 --> 01:58:19,306
You know where he lives?

2025
01:58:19,306 --> 01:58:21,509
Sure I know where he lives. 
He lives in Bailey Park.

2026
01:58:26,275 --> 01:58:28,710
Are you sure this is Bailey Park?

2027
01:58:28,710 --> 01:58:31,415
Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore.

2028
01:58:31,415 --> 01:58:33,823
All I know is this should be Bailey Park.

2029
01:58:35,129 --> 01:58:36,775
But where are the houses?

2030
01:58:36,775 --> 01:58:38,465
You weren't here to build them.

2031
01:58:43,402 --> 01:58:45,303
Your brother, Harry Bailey,

2032
01:58:45,303 --> 01:58:48,431
broke through the ice 
and was drowned at the age of nine.

2033
01:58:48,431 --> 01:58:50,579
That's a lie. 
Harry Bailey went to war!

2034
01:58:50,579 --> 01:58:51,970
He got the Congressional Medal of Honor!

2035
01:58:51,970 --> 01:58:54,099
He saved the lives of every man 
on that transport.

2036
01:58:54,099 --> 01:58:56,256
Every man on that transport died.

2037
01:58:56,256 --> 01:59:00,138
Harry wasn't there to save them, 
because you weren't there to save Harry.

2038
01:59:11,673 --> 01:59:15,706
You see, George, you really had a wonderful life.

2039
01:59:15,706 --> 01:59:20,026
Don't you see what a mistake 
it would be to throw it away?

2040
01:59:20,434 --> 01:59:23,324
- Clarence...
- Yes, George?

2041
01:59:23,324 --> 01:59:26,640
- Where's Mary?
- Oh, well, I...I...I can't do...

2042
01:59:26,640 --> 01:59:28,000
I don't know how you know these things,

2043
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,204
- but tell me, where is she?
- I...

2044
01:59:29,204 --> 01:59:31,191
If you know where she is, 
tell me where my wife is.

2045
01:59:31,191 --> 01:59:32,461
I'm not supposed to tell.

2046
01:59:32,461 --> 01:59:34,328
Please, Clarence, tell me where she is.

2047
01:59:34,328 --> 01:59:36,671
- You're not going to like it, George.
- Where is she?

2048
01:59:36,671 --> 01:59:39,081
She's an old maid. 
She never married.

2049
01:59:39,081 --> 01:59:40,667
Where's Mary, where is she?

2050
01:59:40,667 --> 01:59:41,673
- She is...
- Where is she?

2051
01:59:41,673 --> 01:59:44,602
She's just about to close up the library!

2052
01:59:47,662 --> 01:59:52,051
Aw, there must be some easier way 
for me to get my wings.

2053
02:00:03,366 --> 02:00:04,498
Mary!

2054
02:00:10,052 --> 02:00:11,139
Mary!

2055
02:00:13,770 --> 02:00:18,010
Mary, Mary, Mary...

2056
02:00:18,010 --> 02:00:19,073
Mary, it's George.

2057
02:00:19,073 --> 02:00:20,563
Don't you know me? 
What's happened to us?

2058
02:00:20,563 --> 02:00:22,551
- I don't know you, let me go!
- Mary, please!

2059
02:00:22,551 --> 02:00:25,151
Oh, don't do this to me. 
Please, Mary, help me.

2060
02:00:25,151 --> 02:00:27,141
Where's our kids? 
I need you, Mary!

2061
02:00:28,020 --> 02:00:30,932
Help me, Mary! 
Mary...

2062
02:00:30,932 --> 02:00:31,991
Let me go!

2063
02:00:34,055 --> 02:00:37,737
- Mary, don't run away!
- That man, stop him!

2064
02:00:37,737 --> 02:00:39,621
Tom! 
Ed!

2065
02:00:39,621 --> 02:00:42,420
Charlie! 
That's my wife!

2066
02:00:44,903 --> 02:00:46,519
- Mary!
- Oh, no, you don't!

2067
02:00:46,519 --> 02:00:48,996
- Somebody call the police!
- Hit him with a bottle!

2068
02:00:48,996 --> 02:00:51,004
He needs a straight jacket.

2069
02:00:51,407 --> 02:00:53,427
Mary! Clarence!

2070
02:00:54,189 --> 02:00:55,734
Get out of here!

2071
02:00:55,734 --> 02:00:59,835
- Clarence! 
- Where are you?

2072
02:00:59,835 --> 02:01:01,224
Oh, it's you!

2073
02:01:04,541 --> 02:01:05,777
Stand back!

2074
02:01:19,904 --> 02:01:21,123
Clarence!

2075
02:01:26,146 --> 02:01:28,777
Clarence! 
Clarence!

2076
02:01:29,998 --> 02:01:31,319
Help me, Clarence.

2077
02:01:32,795 --> 02:01:33,930
Get me back.

2078
02:01:35,065 --> 02:01:37,276
Get me back. 
I don't care what happens to me.

2079
02:01:38,342 --> 02:01:40,328
Get me back to my wife and kids.

2080
02:01:40,866 --> 02:01:42,325
Help me, Clarence, please.

2081
02:01:43,478 --> 02:01:46,857
Please! I want to live again.

2082
02:01:46,857 --> 02:01:48,416
I want to live again.

2083
02:01:49,875 --> 02:01:51,511
I want to live again.

2084
02:01:51,511 --> 02:01:54,125
Please, God, let me live again.

2085
02:02:02,883 --> 02:02:03,948
Hey, George.

2086
02:02:05,749 --> 02:02:06,912
George!

2087
02:02:07,950 --> 02:02:10,037
You all right. 
Hey, what's the matter?

2088
02:02:10,037 --> 02:02:12,464
Now get out of here, Bert 
or I'll hit you again! Get out!

2089
02:02:12,464 --> 02:02:14,400
What the Sam Hill you, 
you yelling for, George!

2090
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:19,013
You...
George?

2091
02:02:19,013 --> 02:02:20,420
Bert, do you know me?

2092
02:02:20,420 --> 02:02:22,489
Know you? 
Hum, are you kidding'?

2093
02:02:22,489 --> 02:02:24,702
I've been looking all over town, 
trying to find you.

2094
02:02:24,702 --> 02:02:27,746
I saw your car piled into that tree down there, 
and I thought maybe you...

2095
02:02:27,746 --> 02:02:30,123
Hey, your mouth's bleeding. 
Are you sure you're all right?

2096
02:02:30,123 --> 02:02:31,289
What did you...

2097
02:02:35,549 --> 02:02:38,945
My mouth's bleeding, Bert! 
My mouth's bleed...

2098
02:02:38,945 --> 02:02:42,100
Zuzu's petals, Zuzu's... 
There they are!

2099
02:02:42,100 --> 02:02:45,016
Bert! 
What do you know about that?

2100
02:02:45,016 --> 02:02:47,488
Merry Christmas!

2101
02:02:47,488 --> 02:02:49,323
Well, Merry Christmas!

2102
02:02:49,323 --> 02:02:50,388
Mary!

2103
02:02:51,335 --> 02:02:52,589
Mary!

2104
02:02:53,895 --> 02:02:56,205
Yaa!

2105
02:02:59,796 --> 02:03:01,187
Yaa!

2106
02:03:01,187 --> 02:03:03,584
Hello, Bedford Falls!

2107
02:03:06,117 --> 02:03:09,348
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

2108
02:03:09,348 --> 02:03:11,391
Merry Christmas, George!

2109
02:03:11,391 --> 02:03:14,338
Merry Christmas, movie house!

2110
02:03:14,338 --> 02:03:17,808
Merry Christmas, Emporium!

2111
02:03:17,808 --> 02:03:21,788
Merry Christmas, 
you wonderful old Building and Loan!

2112
02:03:25,943 --> 02:03:29,395
Hey! 
Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!

2113
02:03:29,395 --> 02:03:32,201
Happy New Year to you...in jail.

2114
02:03:32,201 --> 02:03:34,454
Go on home. 
They're waiting for you.

2115
02:03:35,990 --> 02:03:37,140
Mary!

2116
02:03:37,679 --> 02:03:38,795
Mary!

2117
02:03:40,562 --> 02:03:41,797
Mary!

2118
02:03:42,625 --> 02:03:45,645
Well, hello, Mr. Bank Examiner. 
How are you?

2119
02:03:45,645 --> 02:03:47,912
- Mr. Bailey, there's a deficit.
- I know. Eight thousand dollars.

2120
02:03:47,912 --> 02:03:49,200
George, I've got a little paper here.

2121
02:03:49,200 --> 02:03:51,350
I'll bet it's a warrant for my arrest. 
Isn't it wonderful?

2122
02:03:51,350 --> 02:03:52,415
I'm going to jail.

2123
02:03:52,415 --> 02:03:53,604
Merry Christmas! 
Reporters?

2124
02:03:53,604 --> 02:03:54,927
Wh-Where's Mary?

2125
02:03:54,927 --> 02:03:57,845
Mary! 
Oh, look at this wonderful old drafty house.

2126
02:03:57,845 --> 02:04:02,674
Mary! Mary! 
Mary!

2127
02:04:03,243 --> 02:04:05,052
Have you...
Have you seen my wife?

2128
02:04:05,052 --> 02:04:07,924
- Merry Christmas, Daddy! 
- Merry Christmas, Daddy!

2129
02:04:07,924 --> 02:04:10,592
Kids! 
Pete!

2130
02:04:10,592 --> 02:04:12,169
Oh!

2131
02:04:14,668 --> 02:04:17,707
Kids! 
Janie! Janie! Tommy!

2132
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:21,047
Oh, let me look at you.

2133
02:04:21,047 --> 02:04:22,550
Oh, I could eat you up.

2134
02:04:23,515 --> 02:04:26,236
- Where is your mother?
- She went looking for you with Uncle Billy.

2135
02:04:26,236 --> 02:04:28,589
- Daddy!
- Zuzu! Zuzu!

2136
02:04:28,589 --> 02:04:30,710
My little gingersnap! 
How do you feel?

2137
02:04:30,710 --> 02:04:34,783
- Fine! Not a smitch of temperature.
- Not a smitch of tempe...

2138
02:04:34,783 --> 02:04:36,188
Hallelujah!

2139
02:04:37,424 --> 02:04:39,118
- George! George!
- Mary! Mary!

2140
02:04:39,118 --> 02:04:40,612
George, darling! 
Where have you been?

2141
02:04:40,612 --> 02:04:43,007
George, darling! 
Where have you been?

2142
02:04:43,007 --> 02:04:47,828
- Oh, George, George, George.
- Mary! Let me touch you.

2143
02:04:47,828 --> 02:04:50,715
Let me touch you. 
Oh, you're real!

2144
02:04:50,715 --> 02:04:53,433
Oh, George...
George.

2145
02:04:53,433 --> 02:04:55,316
You have no idea what happened to me.

2146
02:04:55,316 --> 02:04:57,679
You have no idea what happened.

2147
02:04:57,679 --> 02:05:01,099
Well, well, come on, George, come on 
downstairs, quick. They're on their way.

2148
02:05:01,099 --> 02:05:02,777
- All right.
- Come on!

2149
02:05:05,482 --> 02:05:07,331
Come on in here now.

2150
02:05:08,296 --> 02:05:12,366
Now, you stand right over here, by the tree. 
Right there, and don't move, don't move.

2151
02:05:12,366 --> 02:05:14,489
What's happening? 
Who's gonna come?

2152
02:05:14,489 --> 02:05:17,483
I hear 'em coming now, George, 
it's a miracle!

2153
02:05:17,483 --> 02:05:20,705
- It's a miracle!
- Who's coming?

2154
02:05:20,705 --> 02:05:21,705
Who's gonna come, Daddy?

2155
02:05:21,705 --> 02:05:22,922
- Who, Daddy?
- I don't know.

2156
02:05:22,922 --> 02:05:26,424
Come in, Uncle Billy. 
Everybody! In here!

2157
02:05:32,859 --> 02:05:35,026
Isn't it wonderful? 
So many faces!

2158
02:05:35,026 --> 02:05:36,170
Mary did it, George! 
Mary did it!

2159
02:05:36,170 --> 02:05:38,063
She told some people 
you were in trouble and then,

2160
02:05:38,063 --> 02:05:40,142
they scattered all over town 
collecting money.

2161
02:05:40,142 --> 02:05:42,982
They didn't ask any questions - just said: 
"If George is in trouble, count me in...

2162
02:05:42,982 --> 02:05:46,482
What is this, George? 
Another run on the bank?

2163
02:05:47,089 --> 02:05:48,978
Here you are, George, 
Merry Christmas.

2164
02:05:51,625 --> 02:05:56,055
The line forms on the right.

2165
02:05:56,055 --> 02:05:58,483
Merry Christmas!
God bless you.

2166
02:06:01,653 --> 02:06:04,951
- Oh, Mr. Martini! 
- Merry Christmas!

2167
02:06:04,951 --> 02:06:07,413
Step right up here.

2168
02:06:07,413 --> 02:06:09,736
I busted the jukebox, too!

2169
02:06:12,846 --> 02:06:14,267
Mr. Gower!

2170
02:06:16,853 --> 02:06:18,934
I made the rounds of all my charge accounts.

2171
02:06:26,788 --> 02:06:29,756
- Violet Bick!
- I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.

2172
02:06:35,741 --> 02:06:39,742
I've been saving this money for a divorce, 
if ever I get a husband.

2173
02:06:44,688 --> 02:06:48,157
There you are, George. 
I got the faculty all up out of bed.

2174
02:06:48,157 --> 02:06:50,180
And here's something for you to play with.

2175
02:06:51,947 --> 02:06:55,170
I wouldn't have a roof over my head 
if it wasn't for you, George.

2176
02:06:55,170 --> 02:06:56,591
Just a minute. 
Just a minute.

2177
02:06:56,591 --> 02:06:58,768
Quiet, everybody. 
Quiet, quiet.

2178
02:06:58,768 --> 02:07:01,856
- I just got this. It's from London.
- Oh.

2179
02:07:01,856 --> 02:07:04,663
Mr. Gower cabled you need cash. Stop.

2180
02:07:04,663 --> 02:07:09,036
My office instructed to advance you 
up to twenty-five thousand dollars. Stop.

2181
02:07:09,036 --> 02:07:12,060
Hee-haw and Merry Christmas. 
Sam Wainwright.

2182
02:07:22,312 --> 02:07:24,984
Mr. Martini. How about some wine?

2183
02:07:30,057 --> 02:07:34,426
Hark, the Herald angels sing

2184
02:07:34,426 --> 02:07:38,664
Glory to the new-born king.

2185
02:07:38,664 --> 02:07:43,020
Peace on earth, and mercy mild,

2186
02:07:43,020 --> 02:07:47,275
God and sinners reconciled.

2187
02:07:47,275 --> 02:07:51,563
Joyful all ye nations rise,

2188
02:07:51,563 --> 02:07:55,834
Join the triumph of the skies,

2189
02:07:55,834 --> 02:08:00,106
With angelic hosts proclaim

2190
02:08:00,106 --> 02:08:04,039
Christ is born in Bethlehem,

2191
02:08:04,039 --> 02:08:08,250
Harry Bailey.

2192
02:08:11,194 --> 02:08:13,518
George, old son of a gun.

2193
02:08:13,518 --> 02:08:17,290
- Harry! Harry!
- Looks like I got here too late.

2194
02:08:17,290 --> 02:08:19,908
Mary, I got him here from the airport 
as quickly as I could.

2195
02:08:19,908 --> 02:08:21,859
The fool flew all the way up here in a blizzard.

2196
02:08:21,859 --> 02:08:23,658
Harry, how about your banquet in New York?

2197
02:08:23,658 --> 02:08:26,019
Oh, I left right in the middle of it 
as soon as I got Mary's telegram.

2198
02:08:26,019 --> 02:08:28,448
Good idea, Ernie, a toast...

2199
02:08:28,448 --> 02:08:30,060
to my big brother George.

2200
02:08:30,060 --> 02:08:31,842
The richest man in town!

2201
02:08:33,452 --> 02:08:39,224
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

2202
02:08:39,224 --> 02:08:44,944
And never brought to mind,

2203
02:08:44,944 --> 02:08:48,688
Should auld acquaintance

2204
02:08:48,688 --> 02:08:55,339
Be forgot, and days of Auld Lang Syne.

2205
02:08:55,339 --> 02:08:56,355
What's that?

2206
02:08:57,933 --> 02:09:01,231
That's a Christmas present from 
a very dear friend of mine.

2207
02:09:02,464 --> 02:09:03,491
Look, Daddy.

2208
02:09:03,491 --> 02:09:09,824
Teacher says every time a bell rings, 
an angel gets his wings.

2209
02:09:09,824 --> 02:09:12,842
That's right. 
That's right.

2210
02:09:14,848 --> 02:09:16,731
Atta boy, Clarence.

2211
02:09:18,677 --> 02:09:24,124
For Auld Land Syne, my dear.

2212
02:09:24,124 --> 02:09:29,384
For Auld Land Syne

2213
02:09:29,384 --> 02:09:34,780
We'll take cup of kindness yet,

2214
02:09:34,780 --> 02:09:41,559
For Auld Lang Syne

2215
02:09:41,559 --> 02:09:46,513
We'll take cup of kindness yet,

2216
02:09:46,513 --> 02:09:54,568
For Auld Lang Syne
