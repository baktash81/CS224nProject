1
00:00:54,716 --> 00:00:58,052
This is the story of how I died.

2
00:00:59,595 --> 00:01:04,183
But don't worry, this is a fun story,
and the truth is, it isn't even mine.

3
00:01:04,267 --> 00:01:07,395
This is the story of a girl
named Rapunzel.

4
00:01:09,054 --> 00:01:10,764
And it starts with the sun.

5
00:01:12,641 --> 00:01:17,271
Once upon a time, a single drop
of sunlight fell from the heavens.

6
00:01:17,354 --> 00:01:23,026
And from this small drop of sun
grew a magic golden flower.

7
00:01:23,944 --> 00:01:27,156
It had the ability to heal
the sick and injured.

8
00:01:28,657 --> 00:01:32,202
You see that old woman over there?
You might want to remember her.

9
00:01:32,286 --> 00:01:33,287
She's kind of important.

10
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,040
Centuries passed

11
00:01:37,124 --> 00:01:39,418
and a hop, skip and a boat ride away
there grew a kingdom.

12
00:01:40,335 --> 00:01:43,547
The kingdom was ruled
by a beloved king and queen.

13
00:01:44,465 --> 00:01:47,176
And the queen
was about to have a baby.

14
00:01:47,843 --> 00:01:48,927
But she got sick.

15
00:01:50,012 --> 00:01:51,013
Really sick.

16
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:53,056
She was running out of time,

17
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,226
and that's when people
start to look for a miracle.

18
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,646
Or in this case, a magic golden flower.

19
00:02:01,106 --> 00:02:02,900
I told you she'd be important.

20
00:02:02,983 --> 00:02:05,235
Instead of sharing the sun's gift,

21
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:08,030
this woman, Mother Gothel,
hoarded its healing power

22
00:02:08,113 --> 00:02:11,408
and used it to keep herself young
for hundreds of years.

23
00:02:11,492 --> 00:02:14,995
And all she had to do
was sing a special song.

24
00:02:15,704 --> 00:02:19,374
Flower, gleam and glow

25
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:23,837
Let your power shine

26
00:02:24,338 --> 00:02:27,591
Make the clock reverse

27
00:02:27,674 --> 00:02:31,512
Bring back what once was mine

28
00:02:31,595 --> 00:02:34,765
What once was mine

29
00:02:34,848 --> 00:02:38,977
You get the gist. She sings to it,
she turns young. Creepy, right?

30
00:02:49,821 --> 00:02:50,864
We found it!

31
00:02:57,037 --> 00:03:01,708
The magic of the golden flower
healed the queen.

32
00:03:02,543 --> 00:03:07,548
A healthy baby girl, a princess
was born, with beautiful golden hair.

33
00:03:16,557 --> 00:03:19,226
I'll give you a hint, that's Rapunzel.

34
00:03:21,186 --> 00:03:22,479
To celebrate her birth,

35
00:03:22,563 --> 00:03:25,899
the king and queen
launched a flying lantern into the sky.

36
00:03:31,321 --> 00:03:34,533
And for that one moment,
everything was perfect.

37
00:03:37,452 --> 00:03:38,996
And then that moment ended.

38
00:03:40,747 --> 00:03:44,835
Flower, gleam and glow

39
00:03:46,795 --> 00:03:50,424
Let your power shine

40
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,593
Make the clock...

41
00:03:59,474 --> 00:04:01,977
Gothel broke into the castle,
stole the child,

42
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,104
and just like that, gone!

43
00:04:06,315 --> 00:04:09,735
The kingdom searched and searched,
but they could not find the princess.

44
00:04:10,027 --> 00:04:13,113
For deep within the forest,
in a hidden tower,

45
00:04:13,196 --> 00:04:14,698
Gothel raised the child as her own.

46
00:04:14,865 --> 00:04:17,618
Save what has been lost

47
00:04:17,784 --> 00:04:21,663
Bring back what once was mine

48
00:04:21,747 --> 00:04:24,374
What once was mine

49
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:27,044
Gothel had found
her new magic flower,

50
00:04:27,127 --> 00:04:29,838
but this time,
she was determined to keep it hidden.

51
00:04:30,464 --> 00:04:33,050
Why can't I go outside?

52
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:35,761
The outside world is a dangerous place,

53
00:04:35,844 --> 00:04:38,388
filled with horrible, selfish people.

54
00:04:38,472 --> 00:04:41,558
You must stay here, where you're safe.

55
00:04:41,642 --> 00:04:43,226
Do you understand, flower?

56
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,686
Yes, Mommy.

57
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:52,527
But the walls of that tower
could not hide everything.

58
00:04:55,822 --> 00:04:57,282
Each year, on her birthday,

59
00:04:57,366 --> 00:05:00,911
the king and queen released
thousands of lanterns into the sky

60
00:05:00,994 --> 00:05:06,083
in hope that one day
their lost princess would return.

61
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:32,102
Well, I guess
Pascal's not hiding out here.

62
00:05:35,105 --> 00:05:36,315
Gotcha!

63
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:42,571
That's 22 for me.
How about 23 out of 45?

64
00:05:43,989 --> 00:05:46,116
Okay. Well, what do you want to do?

65
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:53,707
Yeah. I don't think so.
I like it in here, and so do you.

66
00:05:55,876 --> 00:05:59,213
Come on, Pascal.
It's not so bad in there.

67
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:15,434
Seven a.m., the usual morning lineup

68
00:06:16,352 --> 00:06:20,564
Start on the chores
And sweep till the floor's all clean

69
00:06:21,065 --> 00:06:24,652
Polish and wax, do laundry
and mop and shine up

70
00:06:24,735 --> 00:06:29,156
Sweep again and by then it's, like, 7:15

71
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,661
And so I'll read a book
Or maybe two or three

72
00:06:33,744 --> 00:06:37,998
I'll add a few new paintings
to my gallery

73
00:06:38,082 --> 00:06:42,419
I'll play guitar and knit
and cook and basically

74
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:47,049
Just wonder when will my life begin?

75
00:06:56,392 --> 00:07:00,604
Then after lunch it's puzzles
and darts and baking

76
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:05,150
Papier-mâché, a bit of ballet and chess

77
00:07:05,484 --> 00:07:09,029
Pottery and ventriloquy, candle-making

78
00:07:09,113 --> 00:07:13,826
Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch
Take a climb, sew a dress

79
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:17,871
And I'll reread the books
If I have time to spare

80
00:07:17,955 --> 00:07:22,334
I'll paint the walls some more
I'm sure there's room somewhere

81
00:07:22,418 --> 00:07:26,797
And then I'll brush and brush
and brush and brush my hair

82
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,427
Stuck in the same place
I've always been

83
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:36,557
And I'll keep wondering and wondering
and wondering and wondering

84
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,019
When will my life begin?

85
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:45,399
Tomorrow night

86
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:49,737
the lights will appear

87
00:07:50,446 --> 00:07:53,699
Just like they do

88
00:07:53,782 --> 00:07:58,621
on my birthday each year

89
00:08:00,122 --> 00:08:03,417
What is it like

90
00:08:04,501 --> 00:08:08,422
out there where they glow

91
00:08:09,506 --> 00:08:13,135
Now that I'm older

92
00:08:13,677 --> 00:08:18,182
Mother might just let me go

93
00:08:41,872 --> 00:08:45,000
Wow! I could get used
to a view like this.

94
00:08:45,084 --> 00:08:46,960
Rider, come on!

95
00:08:47,044 --> 00:08:52,299
Hold on. Yep. I'm used to it.
Guys, I want a castle.

96
00:08:52,758 --> 00:08:55,594
We do this job,
you can buy your own castle.

97
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,983
- Hay fever?
- Yeah.

98
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:16,573
Wait! Hey, wait!

99
00:09:17,408 --> 00:09:20,160
Can't you picture me in a castle
of my own? Because I certainly can.

100
00:09:20,244 --> 00:09:23,122
All the things we've seen,
and it's only 8:00 in the morning!

101
00:09:23,205 --> 00:09:26,291
Gentlemen, this is a very big day!

102
00:09:27,418 --> 00:09:30,921
This is it! This is a very big day, Pascal.

103
00:09:31,922 --> 00:09:34,925
I'm finally going to do it.
I'm going to ask her.

104
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,094
Rapunzel!

105
00:09:37,594 --> 00:09:39,263
Let down your hair!

106
00:09:40,222 --> 00:09:41,265
It's time!

107
00:09:42,558 --> 00:09:45,853
I know, I know.
Come on. Don't let her see you.

108
00:09:48,147 --> 00:09:52,151
Rapunzel!
I'm not getting any younger down here!

109
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,570
Coming, Mother!

110
00:10:18,802 --> 00:10:21,388
Hi. Welcome home, Mother.

111
00:10:21,472 --> 00:10:24,725
Rapunzel, how you manage to do that

112
00:10:24,808 --> 00:10:27,978
every single day without fail.

113
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:30,481
It looks absolutely exhausting, darling.

114
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:32,941
Oh, it's nothing.

115
00:10:33,025 --> 00:10:35,319
Then I don't know why it takes so long.

116
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:37,821
Oh, darling, I'm just teasing.

117
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:41,325
All right.

118
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:44,745
So, Mother, as you know
tomorrow is a very big day...

119
00:10:44,828 --> 00:10:46,413
Rapunzel, look in that mirror.

120
00:10:46,497 --> 00:10:47,956
You know what I see?

121
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,127
I see a strong, confident,
beautiful young lady.

122
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:55,422
Oh, look, you're here, too.

123
00:10:55,506 --> 00:10:58,926
I'm just teasing.
Stop taking everything so seriously.

124
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:02,429
Okay. So, Mother,
as I was saying, tomorrow is...

125
00:11:02,513 --> 00:11:04,973
Rapunzel,
Mother's feeling a little run-down.

126
00:11:05,057 --> 00:11:08,060
Would you sing for me, dear?
Then we'll talk.

127
00:11:08,143 --> 00:11:10,479
Of course, Mother.

128
00:11:18,821 --> 00:11:20,197
Flower, gleam and glow
Let your power shine

129
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,949
Make the clock reverse
Bring back what once was mine

130
00:11:22,032 --> 00:11:23,784
Heal what has been hurt
Change the Fates' design

131
00:11:23,867 --> 00:11:25,953
Save what has been lost
Bring back what once was mine

132
00:11:26,036 --> 00:11:27,788
- Rapunzel!
- So, Mother,

133
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,707
earlier I was saying tomorrow
is a big day, and you didn't respond.

134
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,544
So, I'm just going to tell you,
it's my birthday!

135
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:36,547
- Ta-da!
- No, no, no. Can't be.

136
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,967
I distinctly remember.
Your birthday was last year.

137
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:44,388
That's the funny thing about birthdays.
They're kind of an annual thing.

138
00:11:45,222 --> 00:11:49,726
Mother, I'm turning 18,
and I wanted to ask...

139
00:11:50,727 --> 00:11:52,896
What I really want for this birthday...

140
00:11:53,021 --> 00:11:55,357
Actually what I wanted
for quite a few birthdays now...

141
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,609
Rapunzel, please,
stop with the mumbling.

142
00:11:57,693 --> 00:12:00,320
You know how I feel about
the mumbling. Blah-blah-blah-blah.

143
00:12:00,404 --> 00:12:03,073
It's very annoying!
I'm just teasing. You're adorable.

144
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:04,992
I love you so much, darling.

145
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,499
I want to see the floating lights.

146
00:12:14,918 --> 00:12:16,295
What?

147
00:12:16,378 --> 00:12:20,173
I was hoping you would take me
to see the floating lights.

148
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,343
You mean the stars.

149
00:12:23,635 --> 00:12:24,928
That's the thing.

150
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:29,266
I've charted stars,
and they're always constant.

151
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:33,186
But these, they appear every year
on my birthday, Mother.

152
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,230
Only on my birthday.

153
00:12:35,314 --> 00:12:40,485
And I can't help but feel like
they're meant for me.

154
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,238
I need to see them, Mother.

155
00:12:43,322 --> 00:12:46,867
And not just from my window, in person.

156
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,536
I have to know what they are.

157
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,707
You want to go outside?
Why, Rapunzel...

158
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,252
Look at you, as fragile as a flower

159
00:12:57,961 --> 00:13:01,798
Still a little sapling, just a sprout

160
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:04,718
You know why we stay up in this tower

161
00:13:04,801 --> 00:13:06,386
- I know, but...
- That's right.

162
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:10,349
To keep you safe and sound, dear

163
00:13:10,432 --> 00:13:13,143
Guess I always knew
this day was coming

164
00:13:14,102 --> 00:13:16,813
Knew that soon
you'd want to leave the nest

165
00:13:17,481 --> 00:13:18,732
Soon but not yet

166
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:21,318
Shh!
Trust me, pet

167
00:13:21,652 --> 00:13:25,489
Mother knows best

168
00:13:27,824 --> 00:13:30,911
Mother knows best
Listen to your mother

169
00:13:30,994 --> 00:13:33,914
It's a scary world out there

170
00:13:33,997 --> 00:13:35,582
Mother knows best

171
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,627
One way or another
Something will go wrong

172
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,379
I swear

173
00:13:40,462 --> 00:13:43,256
Ruffians, thugs, poison ivy, quicksand

174
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,425
Cannibals and snakes, the plague

175
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:46,593
- No!
- Yes.

176
00:13:46,677 --> 00:13:49,346
Also large bugs
Men with pointy teeth

177
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:52,849
And stop! No more, you'll just upset me

178
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,936
Mother's right here
Mother will protect you

179
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:59,272
Darling, here's what I suggest

180
00:13:59,356 --> 00:14:03,527
Skip the drama
Stay with Mama

181
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:08,407
Mother knows best

182
00:14:10,659 --> 00:14:13,453
Mother knows best
Take it from your mumsy

183
00:14:13,537 --> 00:14:16,373
On your own, you won't survive

184
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:19,376
Sloppy, underdressed
Immature, clumsy

185
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:22,295
Please, they'll eat you up alive

186
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:25,549
Gullible, naive
Positively grubby

187
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:28,385
Ditsy and a bit... Well, hmm, vague

188
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:31,304
Plus, I believe, getting kind of chubby

189
00:14:31,388 --> 00:14:35,475
I'm just saying 'cause I wuv you

190
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:38,645
Mother understands
Mother's here to help you

191
00:14:38,729 --> 00:14:43,984
All I have is one request

192
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:50,699
- Rapunzel?
- Yes?

193
00:14:52,075 --> 00:14:55,996
Don't ever ask to leave this tower again.

194
00:14:57,956 --> 00:14:59,249
Yes, Mother.

195
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:03,503
I love you very much, dear.

196
00:15:04,212 --> 00:15:05,797
I love you more.

197
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:08,258
I love you most.

198
00:15:09,426 --> 00:15:11,553
Don't forget it

199
00:15:11,636 --> 00:15:15,307
You'll regret it

200
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:19,895
Mother knows best

201
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,110
Ta-ta! I'll see you in a bit, my flower!

202
00:15:29,488 --> 00:15:30,947
I'll be here.

203
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:55,968
Oh, no.

204
00:15:57,135 --> 00:15:58,595
This is bad. This is very, very bad.

205
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:00,389
This is really bad.

206
00:16:01,807 --> 00:16:03,892
They just can't get my nose right.

207
00:16:03,976 --> 00:16:05,352
Who cares?

208
00:16:05,435 --> 00:16:08,564
It's easy for you to say.
You guys look amazing.

209
00:16:23,994 --> 00:16:26,830
All right. Okay.
Give me a boost and I'll pull you up.

210
00:16:28,332 --> 00:16:29,792
Give us the satchel first.

211
00:16:32,586 --> 00:16:36,590
I can't believe that after all we've been
through together, you don't trust me?

212
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:40,135
Ouch.

213
00:16:48,394 --> 00:16:50,062
Now help us up, pretty boy!

214
00:16:50,145 --> 00:16:53,023
Sorry, my hands are full.

215
00:16:54,024 --> 00:16:55,150
What?

216
00:16:55,818 --> 00:16:56,860
Rider!

217
00:17:03,367 --> 00:17:05,452
Retrieve that satchel at any cost!

218
00:17:05,536 --> 00:17:06,829
Yes, sir!

219
00:17:23,387 --> 00:17:25,931
We got him now, Maximus.

220
00:17:39,236 --> 00:17:41,322
Come on, fleabag! Forward!

221
00:17:43,741 --> 00:17:45,242
No.

222
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:50,873
Stop it! Stop it!
Give it to me! Give me that!

223
00:19:33,016 --> 00:19:34,518
Alone at last.

224
00:21:10,113 --> 00:21:13,408
Okay. I've got a person in my closet.

225
00:21:13,492 --> 00:21:16,078
I've got a person in my closet.

226
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:21,166
I've got a person in my closet!

227
00:21:23,835 --> 00:21:26,421
Too weak to handle myself out there,
huh, Mother?

228
00:21:26,505 --> 00:21:29,633
Well, tell that to my frying pan.

229
00:22:11,174 --> 00:22:12,884
Rapunzel!

230
00:22:14,553 --> 00:22:16,388
Let down your hair!

231
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,307
One moment, Mother!

232
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,434
I have a big surprise!

233
00:22:20,517 --> 00:22:22,811
I do, too!

234
00:22:22,894 --> 00:22:25,230
I bet my surprise is bigger!

235
00:22:25,522 --> 00:22:27,899
I seriously doubt it.

236
00:22:29,234 --> 00:22:32,654
I brought back parsnips. I'm going
to make hazelnut soup for dinner.

237
00:22:32,738 --> 00:22:35,115
Your favourite. Surprise!

238
00:22:35,198 --> 00:22:37,618
Well, Mother,
there's something I want to tell you.

239
00:22:37,701 --> 00:22:40,537
Oh, Rapunzel, you know I hate
leaving you after a fight.

240
00:22:40,621 --> 00:22:43,081
Especially when I've done
absolutely nothing wrong.

241
00:22:43,165 --> 00:22:45,500
I've been thinking a lot
about what you said earlier.

242
00:22:45,584 --> 00:22:48,128
I hope you're not still talking
about the stars.

243
00:22:48,211 --> 00:22:50,631
"Floating lights,"
and, yes, I'm leading up to that.

244
00:22:50,714 --> 00:22:53,216
Because I really thought
we dropped the issue, sweetheart.

245
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,385
No, Mother, I'm just saying,

246
00:22:55,469 --> 00:22:57,971
you think I'm not strong enough
to handle myself out there.

247
00:22:58,055 --> 00:23:01,308
I know you're not strong enough
to handle yourself out there.

248
00:23:01,391 --> 00:23:04,645
- But if you just...
- We're done talking about this.

249
00:23:04,728 --> 00:23:07,272
- Trust me! I know what I'm...
- Rapunzel.

250
00:23:07,356 --> 00:23:09,900
- Oh, come on!
- Enough with the lights!

251
00:23:09,983 --> 00:23:14,404
You are not leaving this tower! Ever!

252
00:23:20,911 --> 00:23:24,414
Great. Now I'm the bad guy.

253
00:23:36,885 --> 00:23:39,763
All I was going to say, Mother, is that...

254
00:23:40,472 --> 00:23:43,183
I know what I want for my birthday now.

255
00:23:43,266 --> 00:23:45,268
And what is that?

256
00:23:45,686 --> 00:23:47,020
New paint.

257
00:23:47,688 --> 00:23:51,024
The paint made from the white shells
you once brought me.

258
00:23:51,108 --> 00:23:56,279
That is a very long trip, Rapunzel.
Almost three days' time.

259
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:01,618
I just thought it was a better idea
than the stars.

260
00:24:05,747 --> 00:24:08,083
You'll be all right on your own?

261
00:24:08,917 --> 00:24:11,628
I know I'm safe as long as I'm here.

262
00:24:19,636 --> 00:24:22,139
I'll be back in three days' time.

263
00:24:23,098 --> 00:24:25,350
I love you very much, dear.

264
00:24:26,309 --> 00:24:27,644
I love you more.

265
00:24:28,645 --> 00:24:30,814
I love you most.

266
00:24:51,501 --> 00:24:52,502
Okay.

267
00:25:38,423 --> 00:25:41,176
Is this hair?

268
00:25:41,885 --> 00:25:45,096
Struggling... Struggling is pointless.

269
00:25:48,642 --> 00:25:53,230
I know why you're here,
and I'm not afraid of you.

270
00:25:53,688 --> 00:25:55,232
What?

271
00:26:03,573 --> 00:26:07,452
Who are you?
And how did you find me?

272
00:26:10,914 --> 00:26:14,251
Who are you, and how did you find me?

273
00:26:17,671 --> 00:26:21,758
I know not who you are,
nor how I came to find you.

274
00:26:21,842 --> 00:26:23,760
But may I just say...

275
00:26:25,095 --> 00:26:26,847
Hi.

276
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:31,810
How you doing?
The name's Flynn Rider.

277
00:26:33,395 --> 00:26:35,272
How's your day going?

278
00:26:36,606 --> 00:26:40,277
Who else knows my location,
Flynn Rider?

279
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,487
- All right, blondie.
- Rapunzel.

280
00:26:42,571 --> 00:26:44,239
Gesundheit. Here's the deal.

281
00:26:44,322 --> 00:26:47,200
I was in a situation,
gallivanting through the forest.

282
00:26:47,284 --> 00:26:49,619
I came across your tower and...

283
00:26:51,121 --> 00:26:52,330
Where is my satchel?

284
00:26:52,622 --> 00:26:55,834
I've hidden it.
Somewhere you'll never find it.

285
00:26:58,795 --> 00:27:00,630
It's in that pot, isn't it?

286
00:27:07,512 --> 00:27:09,264
Would you stop that?

287
00:27:09,347 --> 00:27:12,225
Now it's hidden
where you'll never find it.

288
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:17,063
So, what do you want with my hair?
To cut it?

289
00:27:17,147 --> 00:27:18,398
- What?
- Sell it?

290
00:27:18,481 --> 00:27:22,152
No! Listen, the only thing
I want to do with your hair

291
00:27:22,235 --> 00:27:24,946
is to get out of it, literally.

292
00:27:25,822 --> 00:27:28,450
Wait. You don't want my hair?

293
00:27:28,533 --> 00:27:30,493
Why on earth would I want your hair?

294
00:27:30,577 --> 00:27:33,204
Look, I was being chased,
I saw a tower, I climbed it.

295
00:27:33,288 --> 00:27:35,874
- End of story.
- You're telling the truth?

296
00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:37,292
Yes.

297
00:27:49,554 --> 00:27:52,015
I know. I need someone to take me.

298
00:27:52,891 --> 00:27:55,143
I think he's telling the truth, too.

299
00:27:55,226 --> 00:27:58,396
He doesn't have fangs.
But what choice do I have?

300
00:28:00,273 --> 00:28:04,277
Okay, Flynn Rider,
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.

301
00:28:04,361 --> 00:28:06,196
- Deal?
- Look this way.

302
00:28:07,697 --> 00:28:10,575
Do you know what these are?

303
00:28:10,659 --> 00:28:13,787
You mean the lantern thing
they do for the princess?

304
00:28:14,371 --> 00:28:17,791
Lanterns? I knew they weren't stars.

305
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:21,211
Well, tomorrow evening,

306
00:28:21,294 --> 00:28:25,173
they will light the night sky
with these lanterns.

307
00:28:25,256 --> 00:28:28,843
You will act as my guide,
take me to these lanterns,

308
00:28:28,927 --> 00:28:30,512
and return me home safely.

309
00:28:30,595 --> 00:28:34,933
Then, and only then,
will I return your satchel to you.

310
00:28:35,016 --> 00:28:36,226
That is my deal.

311
00:28:36,309 --> 00:28:37,686
Yeah.

312
00:28:38,687 --> 00:28:40,146
No can do.

313
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:44,025
Unfortunately the kingdom and I
aren't exactly simpatico at the moment,

314
00:28:44,109 --> 00:28:46,403
so I won't be taking you anywhere.

315
00:28:52,993 --> 00:28:56,162
Something brought you here,
Flynn Rider.

316
00:28:56,246 --> 00:28:57,664
Call it what you will,

317
00:28:57,747 --> 00:29:00,583
- fate, destiny...
- A horse.

318
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:03,003
So I have made the decision
to trust you.

319
00:29:03,086 --> 00:29:04,129
A horrible decision, really.

320
00:29:04,212 --> 00:29:07,298
But trust me when I tell you this.

321
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:12,721
You can tear this tower apart
brick by brick,

322
00:29:12,804 --> 00:29:17,559
but without my help, you will never find
your precious satchel.

323
00:29:19,102 --> 00:29:20,437
Let me get this straight.

324
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,732
I take you to see the lanterns,
bring you back home,

325
00:29:23,815 --> 00:29:25,692
and you'll give me back my satchel?

326
00:29:25,775 --> 00:29:27,277
I promise.

327
00:29:29,112 --> 00:29:33,825
And when I promise something,
I never, ever break that promise.

328
00:29:36,202 --> 00:29:37,579
Ever.

329
00:29:40,832 --> 00:29:43,209
All right, listen.
I didn't want to have to do this,

330
00:29:43,293 --> 00:29:45,045
but you leave me no choice.

331
00:29:45,795 --> 00:29:47,672
Here comes the smoulder.

332
00:29:55,221 --> 00:29:59,225
This is kind of an off day for me.
This doesn't normally happen.

333
00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:01,102
Fine! I'll take you to see the lanterns.

334
00:30:01,186 --> 00:30:02,562
Really?

335
00:30:03,563 --> 00:30:04,564
Oops.

336
00:30:04,647 --> 00:30:06,649
You broke my smoulder.

337
00:30:12,155 --> 00:30:14,157
Are you coming, blondie?

338
00:30:24,042 --> 00:30:27,754
Look at the world so close
And I'm halfway to it

339
00:30:29,005 --> 00:30:33,093
Look at it all so big
Do I even dare

340
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:37,889
Look at me, there at last
I just have to do it

341
00:30:38,556 --> 00:30:42,685
Should I? No
Here I go

342
00:31:13,591 --> 00:31:19,180
Just smell the grass, the dirt
Just like I dreamed they'd be

343
00:31:20,598 --> 00:31:25,937
Just feel that summer breeze
The way it's calling me

344
00:31:27,605 --> 00:31:32,944
For, like, the first time ever
I'm completely free

345
00:31:34,362 --> 00:31:38,241
I could go running and racing

346
00:31:38,324 --> 00:31:40,243
And dancing and chasing

347
00:31:40,535 --> 00:31:44,330
And leaping and bounding
Hair flying, heart pounding

348
00:31:44,414 --> 00:31:48,585
And splashing and reeling
and finally feeling

349
00:31:49,544 --> 00:31:55,633
That's when my life begins

350
00:32:03,099 --> 00:32:06,269
I can't believe I did this!

351
00:32:06,936 --> 00:32:11,274
I can't believe I did this.
I can't believe I did this!

352
00:32:12,901 --> 00:32:14,736
Mother would be so furious.

353
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:18,198
But that's okay. What she doesn't know
won't kill her, right?

354
00:32:18,281 --> 00:32:21,075
Oh, my gosh! This would kill her.

355
00:32:21,242 --> 00:32:24,495
This is so fun!

356
00:32:24,954 --> 00:32:27,832
I am a horrible daughter.
I'm going back.

357
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:30,543
I am never going back!

358
00:32:32,003 --> 00:32:34,714
I am a despicable human being!

359
00:32:36,925 --> 00:32:39,344
Best day ever!

360
00:32:48,436 --> 00:32:51,856
You know,
I can't help but notice you seem

361
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,484
a little at war with yourself here.

362
00:32:55,318 --> 00:32:57,904
- What?
- I'm only picking up bits and pieces.

363
00:32:57,987 --> 00:33:01,658
Overprotective mother,
forbidden road trip. This is serious stuff.

364
00:33:02,283 --> 00:33:05,370
But let me ease your conscience.
This is part of growing up.

365
00:33:05,453 --> 00:33:09,666
A little rebellion, a little adventure,
that's good. Healthy, even.

366
00:33:11,584 --> 00:33:12,669
You think?

367
00:33:12,752 --> 00:33:15,922
I know. You're way over-thinking this,
trust me.

368
00:33:16,005 --> 00:33:18,049
Does your mother deserve it? No.

369
00:33:18,132 --> 00:33:21,052
Would this break her heart
and crush her soul? Of course.

370
00:33:21,135 --> 00:33:23,221
But you've got to do it.

371
00:33:24,055 --> 00:33:25,598
"Break her heart"?

372
00:33:26,057 --> 00:33:28,685
- In half.
-"Crush her soul"?

373
00:33:29,686 --> 00:33:30,895
Like a grape.

374
00:33:30,979 --> 00:33:33,982
She would be heartbroken. You're right.

375
00:33:34,065 --> 00:33:37,610
I am, aren't I? Oh, bother.

376
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:42,657
All right. I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I'm letting you out of the deal.

377
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,785
- What?
- That's right, but don't thank me.

378
00:33:45,868 --> 00:33:49,080
Let's turn around and get you home.
Here's your pan, here's your frog.

379
00:33:49,163 --> 00:33:50,415
I get back my satchel,

380
00:33:50,498 --> 00:33:53,835
you get back a mother-daughter
relationship based on mutual trust,

381
00:33:53,918 --> 00:33:57,130
and voilà,
we part ways as unlikely friends.

382
00:33:57,213 --> 00:34:00,258
No. I am seeing those lanterns.

383
00:34:00,341 --> 00:34:03,970
Oh, come on! What is it going to take
for me to get my satchel back?

384
00:34:04,053 --> 00:34:05,680
I will use this.

385
00:34:08,766 --> 00:34:11,936
Is it ruffians? Thugs?
Have they come for me?

386
00:34:16,024 --> 00:34:18,651
Stay calm. It can probably smell fear.

387
00:34:20,486 --> 00:34:24,657
Sorry. Guess I'm just a little bit jumpy.

388
00:34:25,533 --> 00:34:29,454
Probably be best if we avoid ruffians
and thugs, though.

389
00:34:30,246 --> 00:34:32,749
Yeah, that would probably be best.

390
00:34:34,292 --> 00:34:36,836
Are you hungry?
I know a great place for lunch.

391
00:34:38,004 --> 00:34:39,172
Where?

392
00:34:39,255 --> 00:34:41,966
Don't you worry.
You'll know it when you smell it.

393
00:35:20,122 --> 00:35:21,832
A palace horse.

394
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:24,793
Where's your rider?

395
00:35:27,629 --> 00:35:28,964
Rapunzel!

396
00:35:36,388 --> 00:35:40,058
Rapunzel! Let down your hair!

397
00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:56,856
I know it's around here somewhere.

398
00:36:57,607 --> 00:37:01,152
Ah, there it is! The Snuggly Duckling.

399
00:37:02,612 --> 00:37:04,153
Don't worry. Very quaint place.
Perfect for you.

400
00:37:04,236 --> 00:37:07,531
Don't want you scaring and giving up
on this whole endeavour now, do we?

401
00:37:07,615 --> 00:37:11,077
- Well, I do like ducklings.
- Yay!

402
00:37:12,703 --> 00:37:15,039
Garcon, your finest table, please!

403
00:37:21,879 --> 00:37:25,174
You smell that?
Take a deep breath through the nose.

404
00:37:25,466 --> 00:37:27,802
Really let that seep in.
What are you getting?

405
00:37:27,885 --> 00:37:31,597
To me, it's part man-smell and the other
part is really bad man-smell.

406
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,475
I don't know why, but overall it smells
like the colour brown. Your thoughts?

407
00:37:35,996 --> 00:37:38,373
That's a lot of hair.

408
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:40,792
She's growing it out.
Is that blood in your moustache?

409
00:37:40,876 --> 00:37:43,545
Goldie, look at all the blood
in his moustache!

410
00:37:43,837 --> 00:37:45,714
Good sir, that's a lot of blood!

411
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:51,428
You don't look so good, blondie. Maybe
we should get you home, call it a day.

412
00:37:51,511 --> 00:37:54,431
Probably better off.
This is a five-star joint.

413
00:37:54,514 --> 00:37:57,726
If you can't handle this place, maybe
you should be back in your tower.

414
00:37:59,019 --> 00:38:00,395
Is this you?

415
00:38:03,523 --> 00:38:05,359
- Now they're just being mean.
- It's him, all right.

416
00:38:06,958 --> 00:38:09,586
Greno, go find some guards.

417
00:38:09,669 --> 00:38:13,047
That reward
is going to buy me a new hook.

418
00:38:13,131 --> 00:38:16,593
- I could use the money.
- What about me? I'm broke!

419
00:38:16,676 --> 00:38:17,677
Get back!

420
00:38:17,927 --> 00:38:19,053
- Mine!
- Ruffians, stop!

421
00:38:19,137 --> 00:38:22,015
- We can work this out!
- Leave him alone!

422
00:38:22,098 --> 00:38:23,308
Gentlemen, please!

423
00:38:23,391 --> 00:38:26,769
Give me back my guide! Ruffians!

424
00:38:35,153 --> 00:38:36,696
Not the nose! Not the nose!

425
00:38:39,741 --> 00:38:41,492
Put him down!

426
00:38:44,287 --> 00:38:48,208
I don't know where I am, and I need him
to take me to see the lanterns

427
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:51,211
because I've been dreaming about them
my entire life!

428
00:38:51,294 --> 00:38:56,257
Find your humanity!
Haven't any of you ever had a dream?

429
00:39:08,144 --> 00:39:10,980
I had a dream once.

430
00:39:19,656 --> 00:39:24,369
I'm malicious, mean and scary
My sneer could curdle dairy

431
00:39:24,452 --> 00:39:27,914
And violence-wise
my hands are not the cleanest

432
00:39:27,997 --> 00:39:32,210
But despite my evil look
And my temper and my hook

433
00:39:32,752 --> 00:39:35,797
I've always yearned
to be a concert pianist

434
00:39:36,339 --> 00:39:40,051
Can't you see me on the stage
performing Mozart

435
00:39:40,134 --> 00:39:43,263
Tickling the ivories till they gleam

436
00:39:43,346 --> 00:39:47,267
Yep, I'd rather be called deadly
For my killer show tune medley

437
00:39:48,268 --> 00:39:49,269
Thank you!

438
00:39:49,352 --> 00:39:52,105
'Cause way down deep inside
I've got a dream

439
00:39:52,188 --> 00:39:55,566
He's got a dream
He's got a dream

440
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:59,612
See, I ain't as cruel and vicious
as I seem

441
00:39:59,696 --> 00:40:03,366
Though I do like breaking femurs
You can count me with the dreamers

442
00:40:03,449 --> 00:40:06,327
Like everybody else I've got a dream

443
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:15,920
I've got scars and lumps and bruises
Plus something here that oozes

444
00:40:16,004 --> 00:40:19,132
And let's not even mention
my complexion

445
00:40:19,215 --> 00:40:23,011
But despite my extra toes
And my goitre and my nose

446
00:40:23,094 --> 00:40:26,389
I really want to make a love connection

447
00:40:26,472 --> 00:40:30,184
Can't you see me
with a special little lady?

448
00:40:30,268 --> 00:40:33,604
Rowing in a rowboat down the stream

449
00:40:33,688 --> 00:40:37,483
Though I'm one disgusting blighter
I'm a lover not a fighter

450
00:40:37,567 --> 00:40:40,486
'Cause way down deep inside
I've got a dream

451
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:42,405
- I've got a dream
- He's got a dream

452
00:40:42,488 --> 00:40:44,407
- I've got a dream
- He's got a dream

453
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:47,827
And I know one day
romance will reign supreme

454
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,829
Though my face
leaves people screaming

455
00:40:49,912 --> 00:40:51,831
There's a child behind it dreaming

456
00:40:51,914 --> 00:40:55,084
Like everybody else, I've got a dream

457
00:40:55,585 --> 00:40:58,755
Thor would like to quit and be a florist

458
00:40:59,172 --> 00:41:02,425
Gunther does interior design

459
00:41:02,508 --> 00:41:06,095
- Ulf is into mime
- Attila's cupcakes are sublime

460
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:09,640
Bruiser knits, Killer sews
Fang does little puppet shows

461
00:41:09,724 --> 00:41:15,438
And Vladimir collects ceramic unicorns

462
00:41:16,606 --> 00:41:18,941
- What about you?
- I'm sorry, me?

463
00:41:19,025 --> 00:41:20,276
What's your dream?

464
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,279
No, no, no. Sorry, boys. I don't sing.

465
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:26,532
I have dreams like you
No, really

466
00:41:26,616 --> 00:41:28,201
Just much less touchy-feely

467
00:41:28,284 --> 00:41:31,329
They mainly happen
somewhere warm and sunny

468
00:41:31,412 --> 00:41:35,041
On an island that I own
Tanned and rested and alone

469
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:39,087
Surrounded by enormous
piles of money

470
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:41,047
- I've got a dream
- She's got a dream

471
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,882
- I've got a dream
- She's got a dream

472
00:41:42,965 --> 00:41:46,260
I just want to see
the floating lanterns gleam

473
00:41:46,677 --> 00:41:50,681
And with every passing hour
I'm so glad I left my tower

474
00:41:50,765 --> 00:41:53,601
Like all you lovely folks
I've got a dream

475
00:41:53,684 --> 00:41:55,395
She's got a dream
He's got a dream

476
00:41:55,478 --> 00:41:57,313
They've got a dream
We've got a dream

477
00:41:57,397 --> 00:42:00,608
So our differences
ain't really that extreme

478
00:42:00,691 --> 00:42:04,779
We're one big team

479
00:42:05,488 --> 00:42:06,697
- Call us brutal
- Sick

480
00:42:06,781 --> 00:42:09,242
- Sadistic
- And grotesquely optimistic

481
00:42:09,325 --> 00:42:11,577
'Cause way down deep inside
we've got a dream

482
00:42:11,661 --> 00:42:14,497
- I've got a dream
- I've got a dream

483
00:42:17,834 --> 00:42:23,339
Yes, way down deep inside
I've got a dream

484
00:42:31,931 --> 00:42:33,266
I found the guards!

485
00:42:36,018 --> 00:42:38,020
Where's Rider? Where is he?

486
00:42:38,479 --> 00:42:40,606
I know he's in here somewhere.
Find him.

487
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,733
Turn the place upside down
if you have to!

488
00:42:59,353 --> 00:43:01,438
Go. Live your dream.

489
00:43:02,272 --> 00:43:04,358
- I will.
- Your dream stinks.

490
00:43:04,441 --> 00:43:06,235
I was talking to her.

491
00:43:07,945 --> 00:43:09,863
Thanks for everything.

492
00:43:13,367 --> 00:43:16,036
I believe
this is the man you're looking for.

493
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,996
You got me!

494
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:20,791
Sir, there's no sign of Rider.

495
00:43:24,752 --> 00:43:25,753
Maximus!

496
00:43:33,802 --> 00:43:35,637
What's he doing?

497
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:47,107
A passage! Come on, men. Let's go.

498
00:43:48,067 --> 00:43:50,903
Conli! Make sure those boys
don't get away.

499
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:56,658
Play it safe

500
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:00,162
or go get the crown?

501
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:12,091
I got a dream
I got some dreams

502
00:44:14,468 --> 00:44:16,678
Somebody get me a glass!

503
00:44:16,762 --> 00:44:20,516
Because I just found me
a tall drink of water.

504
00:44:21,183 --> 00:44:23,352
Oh, stop it, you big lug.

505
00:44:25,187 --> 00:44:27,106
Where does that tunnel let out?

506
00:44:27,189 --> 00:44:28,607
Knife!

507
00:44:31,026 --> 00:44:35,948
I didn't know you had that in you
back there. That was pretty impressive.

508
00:44:36,031 --> 00:44:37,324
I know!

509
00:44:39,034 --> 00:44:40,494
I know.

510
00:44:43,497 --> 00:44:46,834
So... Flynn? Where are you from?

511
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:49,378
Whoa! Sorry, blondie,
I don't do back-story.

512
00:44:49,461 --> 00:44:52,047
However, I am becoming
very interested in yours.

513
00:44:52,131 --> 00:44:54,716
I know I'm not supposed
to mention the hair.

514
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,343
- Nope.
- Or the mother.

515
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:59,054
- Uh-uh.
- I'm too scared to ask about the frog.

516
00:44:59,221 --> 00:45:00,597
- Chameleon.
- Nuance.

517
00:45:00,889 --> 00:45:05,394
Here's my question, though,
if you want to see the lanterns so badly

518
00:45:05,477 --> 00:45:07,396
why haven't you gone before?

519
00:45:10,023 --> 00:45:11,233
Well...

520
00:45:18,407 --> 00:45:19,533
Flynn?

521
00:45:20,075 --> 00:45:21,285
Rider?

522
00:45:21,368 --> 00:45:23,328
Run. Run!

523
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:43,974
- Who's that?
- They don't like me.

524
00:45:44,516 --> 00:45:47,311
- Who's that?
- They don't like me either.

525
00:45:47,394 --> 00:45:48,479
Who's that?

526
00:45:48,562 --> 00:45:51,523
Let's assume that everyone in here
doesn't like me.

527
00:45:51,607 --> 00:45:52,774
Here.

528
00:46:01,783 --> 00:46:03,869
I waited a long time for this.

529
00:46:13,295 --> 00:46:16,965
Oh, mama!
I have got to get me one of these!

530
00:46:25,307 --> 00:46:29,645
You should know that this
is the strangest thing I've ever done!

531
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,818
How about two out of three?

532
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:44,993
Flynn, look out!

533
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:52,334
You should see your faces,
because you look...

534
00:46:53,252 --> 00:46:54,836
...ridiculous.

535
00:47:01,969 --> 00:47:04,680
Come on, blondie! Jump!

536
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:36,688
It's no use. I can't see anything.

537
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:45,280
Hey, there's no point.
It's pitch-black down there.

538
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,165
This is all my fault.

539
00:48:56,875 --> 00:48:59,961
She was right.
I never should have done this.

540
00:49:06,134 --> 00:49:08,220
I'm so sorry, Flynn.

541
00:49:15,977 --> 00:49:17,187
Eugene.

542
00:49:18,647 --> 00:49:19,773
What?

543
00:49:20,816 --> 00:49:23,318
My real name is Eugene Fitzherbert.

544
00:49:24,903 --> 00:49:26,988
Someone might as well know.

545
00:49:29,825 --> 00:49:32,619
I have magic hair
that glows when I sing.

546
00:49:33,328 --> 00:49:34,496
What?

547
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:40,419
I have magic hair that glows
when I sing!

548
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:44,715
Flower gleam and glow
Let your power shine

549
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:36,975
We made it.

550
00:50:37,058 --> 00:50:40,520
- Her hair glows.
- We're alive. I'm alive!

551
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:44,191
I didn't see that coming.
The hair actually glows.

552
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:45,901
- Why does her hair glow?
- Eugene!

553
00:50:45,984 --> 00:50:46,985
What?

554
00:50:48,695 --> 00:50:50,989
It doesn't just glow.

555
00:50:53,408 --> 00:50:55,452
Why is he smiling at me?

556
00:51:19,601 --> 00:51:22,437
I'll kill him. I'll kill that Rider!

557
00:51:23,939 --> 00:51:27,943
We'll cut him off at the kingdom
and get back the crown. Come on!

558
00:51:29,194 --> 00:51:30,612
Or...

559
00:51:32,405 --> 00:51:35,325
Perhaps you want to stop
acting like wild dogs

560
00:51:35,408 --> 00:51:38,787
chasing their tails
and think for a moment.

561
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:43,416
Oh, please, there's no need for that.

562
00:51:48,919 --> 00:51:52,547
Well, if that's all you desire,
then be on your way.

563
00:51:52,631 --> 00:51:55,634
I was going to offer you something
worth 1,000 crowns.

564
00:51:55,717 --> 00:51:57,344
Would have made you
rich beyond belief,

565
00:51:57,427 --> 00:51:59,221
and that wasn't even the best part.

566
00:51:59,304 --> 00:52:03,308
Oh, well. C'est la vie. Enjoy your crown!

567
00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:06,478
What's the best part?

568
00:52:06,978 --> 00:52:11,942
It comes with revenge on Flynn Rider.

569
00:52:19,009 --> 00:52:20,845
You're being strangely cryptic

570
00:52:20,928 --> 00:52:24,223
as you wrap your magic hair
around my injured hand.

571
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:26,225
Sorry.

572
00:52:27,393 --> 00:52:31,439
Just don't... Don't freak out.

573
00:52:37,069 --> 00:52:40,740
Flower, gleam and glow

574
00:52:41,407 --> 00:52:44,368
Let your power shine

575
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:49,123
Make the clock reverse

576
00:52:49,206 --> 00:52:52,960
Bring back what once was mine

577
00:52:54,378 --> 00:52:57,214
Heal what has been hurt

578
00:52:58,257 --> 00:53:01,510
Change the Fates' design

579
00:53:02,595 --> 00:53:05,848
Save what has been lost

580
00:53:05,931 --> 00:53:09,101
Bring back what once was mine

581
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:14,523
What once was mine

582
00:53:28,871 --> 00:53:30,873
Please don't freak out!

583
00:53:33,959 --> 00:53:36,086
I'm not freaking out.
Are you freaking out?

584
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:39,423
I'm just interested in your hair
and the magical qualities it possesses.

585
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:42,301
How long has it been
doing that exactly?

586
00:53:43,552 --> 00:53:45,888
Forever, I guess.

587
00:53:46,764 --> 00:53:50,059
Mother says when I was a baby,
people tried to cut it.

588
00:53:50,142 --> 00:53:52,061
They wanted to take it for themselves.

589
00:53:52,645 --> 00:53:57,566
But once it's cut,
it turns brown and loses its power.

590
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,529
A gift like that, it has to be protected.

591
00:54:02,488 --> 00:54:04,907
That's why Mother never let me...

592
00:54:08,327 --> 00:54:11,330
That's why I never left and...

593
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:16,794
You never left that tower.

594
00:54:20,506 --> 00:54:22,675
And you're still going to go back?

595
00:54:22,967 --> 00:54:25,219
No! Yes.

596
00:54:27,388 --> 00:54:29,348
It's complicated.

597
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:42,862
So, Eugene Fitzherbert, huh?

598
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:44,989
Ah, yeah. Well...

599
00:54:45,072 --> 00:54:48,409
I'll spare you the sob story
of poor orphan Eugene Fitzherbert.

600
00:54:48,492 --> 00:54:51,787
It's a little bit of a downer.

601
00:54:58,043 --> 00:55:02,047
There was this book I used to read
every night to all the younger kids.

602
00:55:02,131 --> 00:55:03,799
The Tales of Flynnagan Rider.

603
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:08,470
Swashbuckling rogue, richest man
alive, not bad with the ladies either.

604
00:55:08,554 --> 00:55:11,140
Not that he'd ever brag about it,
of course.

605
00:55:11,682 --> 00:55:13,434
Was he a thief, too?

606
00:55:15,269 --> 00:55:16,729
Well, no.

607
00:55:17,354 --> 00:55:20,232
He had enough money to do anything
that he wanted to do.

608
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:21,901
He could go anywhere
that he wanted to go.

609
00:55:22,651 --> 00:55:26,655
And for a kid with nothing,
I don't know, I...

610
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:30,075
Just seemed like the better option.

611
00:55:31,243 --> 00:55:33,704
You can't tell anyone about this, okay?

612
00:55:34,121 --> 00:55:36,248
It could ruin my whole reputation.

613
00:55:37,458 --> 00:55:38,918
We wouldn't want that.

614
00:55:39,001 --> 00:55:41,587
A fake reputation is all a man has.

615
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:51,388
Well, I should...

616
00:55:52,598 --> 00:55:54,934
I should get some more firewood.

617
00:55:57,603 --> 00:56:03,275
For the record, I like Eugene Fitzherbert
much better than Flynn Rider.

618
00:56:06,445 --> 00:56:09,615
Then you'd be the first. But thank you.

619
00:56:19,416 --> 00:56:22,711
Well, I thought he'd never leave.

620
00:56:22,795 --> 00:56:24,171
Mother?

621
00:56:24,254 --> 00:56:25,756
Hello, dear.

622
00:56:28,884 --> 00:56:30,177
How did you find me?

623
00:56:30,469 --> 00:56:32,346
It was easy, really.

624
00:56:32,429 --> 00:56:36,809
I just listened for the sound of complete
and utter betrayal and followed that.

625
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,399
- We're going home. Now.
- You don't understand.

626
00:56:43,482 --> 00:56:47,903
I've been on this incredible journey,
and I've seen and learned so much.

627
00:56:48,821 --> 00:56:49,989
I even met someone.

628
00:56:50,072 --> 00:56:53,158
Yes, the wanted thief. I'm so proud.
Come on.

629
00:56:53,492 --> 00:56:56,161
Mother, wait. I think...

630
00:56:57,871 --> 00:56:59,373
I think he likes me.

631
00:56:59,623 --> 00:57:02,334
Likes you?
Please, Rapunzel, that's demented!

632
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,546
This is why you never should have left

633
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:09,591
Dear, this whole romance
that you've invented

634
00:57:09,675 --> 00:57:14,221
Just proves you're too naive to be here

635
00:57:14,763 --> 00:57:17,641
Why would he like you?
Come on now, really

636
00:57:18,267 --> 00:57:21,353
Look at you!
You think that he's impressed?

637
00:57:21,895 --> 00:57:25,649
Don't be a dummy, come with Mummy

638
00:57:26,316 --> 00:57:27,776
Mother...

639
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:29,194
No!

640
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,405
No?

641
00:57:32,364 --> 00:57:36,035
Oh, I see how it is

642
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:42,124
Rapunzel knows best
Rapunzel's so mature now

643
00:57:42,207 --> 00:57:45,210
Such a clever grown-up miss

644
00:57:45,711 --> 00:57:49,298
Rapunzel knows best
Fine, if you're so sure now

645
00:57:49,381 --> 00:57:52,760
- Go ahead, then give him this!
- How did you...

646
00:57:52,968 --> 00:57:56,346
This is why he's here
Don't let him deceive you

647
00:57:56,430 --> 00:57:58,640
Give it to him, watch, you'll see

648
00:57:58,724 --> 00:57:59,683
I will!

649
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:03,020
Trust me, my dear
That's how fast he'll leave you

650
00:58:03,353 --> 00:58:06,774
I won't say I told you so

651
00:58:06,857 --> 00:58:11,236
No, Rapunzel knows best
So, if he's such a dreamboat

652
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,739
Go and put him to the test

653
00:58:13,822 --> 00:58:14,823
Mother, wait!

654
00:58:14,907 --> 00:58:20,496
If he's lying, don't come crying

655
00:58:21,413 --> 00:58:26,293
Mother knows best

656
00:58:32,007 --> 00:58:35,594
So, can I ask you something?

657
00:58:36,595 --> 00:58:39,932
Is there any chance that I'm going to get
super strength in my hand?

658
00:58:40,015 --> 00:58:43,477
Because I'm not going to lie.
That would be stupendous.

659
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,979
Hey, you all right?

660
00:58:47,397 --> 00:58:52,236
Sorry, yes. Just lost in thought, I guess.

661
00:58:54,863 --> 00:58:56,031
Here's the thing,

662
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:59,409
superhuman good looks,
I've always had them. Born with it.

663
00:58:59,493 --> 00:59:03,705
But superhuman strength. Can you
imagine the possibilities of this?

664
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,962
Patience, boys.

665
00:59:10,587 --> 00:59:14,758
All good things to those who wait.

666
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:36,655
Well, I hope you're here to apologise.

667
00:59:39,658 --> 00:59:42,244
No, put me down. Stop it! No!

668
00:59:42,327 --> 00:59:44,329
Let me go!

669
00:59:45,038 --> 00:59:46,832
Give me him!

670
00:59:47,124 --> 00:59:48,917
Stop, stop, stop!

671
00:59:59,011 --> 01:00:01,013
Easy, boy. Easy! Settle down.

672
01:00:03,223 --> 01:00:04,600
Easy, boy. Easy.

673
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:06,643
Easy.

674
01:00:08,353 --> 01:00:09,980
That's it.

675
01:00:13,317 --> 01:00:14,401
Now sit.

676
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:17,321
Sit!

677
01:00:17,863 --> 01:00:19,865
- What?
- Now drop the boot.

678
01:00:20,407 --> 01:00:21,700
Drop it.

679
01:00:24,286 --> 01:00:28,749
You're such a good boy! Yes, you are!

680
01:00:30,292 --> 01:00:33,879
You all tired from chasing this bad man
all over the place?

681
01:00:33,962 --> 01:00:37,841
- Excuse me?
- Nobody appreciates you, do they?

682
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:39,092
Do they?

683
01:00:39,176 --> 01:00:41,220
Oh, come on. He's a bad horse!

684
01:00:41,303 --> 01:00:43,931
Oh, he's nothing but a big sweetheart.

685
01:00:45,098 --> 01:00:46,516
Isn't that right...

686
01:00:47,059 --> 01:00:48,560
Maximus?

687
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:51,647
You've got to be kidding me.

688
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:56,443
Look. Today is kind of
the biggest day of my life,

689
01:00:57,027 --> 01:01:00,906
and the thing is,
I need you not to get him arrested.

690
01:01:01,657 --> 01:01:02,866
Just for 24 hours,

691
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:06,787
and then you can chase each other
to your heart's content.

692
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:15,045
And it's also my birthday.
Just so you know.

693
01:02:06,805 --> 01:02:08,473
Excuse me. Sorry.

694
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,248
Thank you!

695
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:50,766
It's for the lost princess.

696
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:10,971
To the boats!

697
01:04:22,232 --> 01:04:23,275
Hey, Max!

698
01:04:26,653 --> 01:04:29,531
What? I bought them.

699
01:04:32,409 --> 01:04:33,869
Most of them.

700
01:04:35,579 --> 01:04:37,164
Where are we going?

701
01:04:37,247 --> 01:04:41,126
Best day of your life?
I figured you should have a decent seat.

702
01:04:59,644 --> 01:05:01,021
You Okay?

703
01:05:01,855 --> 01:05:03,482
I'm terrified.

704
01:05:04,357 --> 01:05:05,650
Why?

705
01:05:06,443 --> 01:05:10,739
I've been looking out a window
for 18 years,

706
01:05:10,822 --> 01:05:15,660
dreaming about what it might feel like
when those lights rise in the sky.

707
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:20,624
What if it's not everything
that I dreamed it would be?

708
01:05:23,168 --> 01:05:24,544
It will be.

709
01:05:26,004 --> 01:05:30,634
And what if it is? What do I do then?

710
01:05:31,092 --> 01:05:36,014
That's the good part, I guess.
You get to go find a new dream.

711
01:07:09,691 --> 01:07:14,738
All those days
watching from the windows

712
01:07:14,821 --> 01:07:18,450
All those years, outside looking in

713
01:07:19,284 --> 01:07:24,080
All that time, never even knowing

714
01:07:24,164 --> 01:07:28,960
Just how blind I've been

715
01:07:29,586 --> 01:07:34,132
Now I'm here, blinking in the starlight

716
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:38,553
Now I'm here, suddenly I see

717
01:07:38,928 --> 01:07:43,600
Standing here, it's, oh, so clear

718
01:07:43,683 --> 01:07:48,271
I'm where I'm meant to be

719
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:52,651
And at last I see the light

720
01:07:52,984 --> 01:07:56,988
And it's like the fog has lifted

721
01:07:57,656 --> 01:08:02,243
And at last I see the light

722
01:08:02,327 --> 01:08:06,122
And it's like the sky is new

723
01:08:06,956 --> 01:08:11,586
And it's warm and real and bright

724
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:17,008
And the world has somehow shifted

725
01:08:20,011 --> 01:08:24,933
All at once, everything looks different

726
01:08:25,016 --> 01:08:29,312
Now that I see you

727
01:08:36,111 --> 01:08:38,613
I have something for you, too.

728
01:08:38,988 --> 01:08:42,200
I should have given it to you before,
but I was just scared.

729
01:08:42,534 --> 01:08:47,122
And the thing is, I'm not scared
any more. You know what I mean?

730
01:08:48,998 --> 01:08:51,209
I'm starting to.

731
01:08:55,255 --> 01:08:59,801
All those days
chasing down a daydream

732
01:09:00,218 --> 01:09:04,013
All those years, living in a blur

733
01:09:04,556 --> 01:09:09,144
All that time, never truly seeing

734
01:09:09,227 --> 01:09:12,897
Things the way they were

735
01:09:13,982 --> 01:09:18,820
Now she's here, shining in the starlight

736
01:09:18,903 --> 01:09:22,907
Now she's here, suddenly I know

737
01:09:23,408 --> 01:09:27,996
If she's here, it's crystal clear

738
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:32,167
I'm where I'm meant to go

739
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:36,838
And at last I see the light

740
01:09:36,921 --> 01:09:41,050
And it's like the fog has lifted

741
01:09:41,134 --> 01:09:45,472
And at last I see the light

742
01:09:45,555 --> 01:09:49,684
And it's like the sky is new

743
01:09:49,934 --> 01:09:54,564
And it's warm and real and bright

744
01:09:54,647 --> 01:10:00,111
And the world has somehow shifted

745
01:10:03,156 --> 01:10:08,203
All at once, everything is different

746
01:10:08,286 --> 01:10:13,792
Now that I see you

747
01:10:17,253 --> 01:10:19,422
Now that I...

748
01:10:20,465 --> 01:10:23,843
see you

749
01:10:43,446 --> 01:10:46,157
Is everything okay?

750
01:10:48,117 --> 01:10:49,327
Oh, yes.

751
01:10:50,245 --> 01:10:53,081
Yes, of course. I just...

752
01:10:58,837 --> 01:11:01,172
I'm sorry. Everything is fine.

753
01:11:01,714 --> 01:11:03,800
There's just something
I have to take care of.

754
01:11:06,678 --> 01:11:07,762
Okay.

755
01:11:09,514 --> 01:11:11,307
I'll be right back.

756
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:19,357
It's all right, Pascal.

757
01:11:26,739 --> 01:11:28,616
There you are!

758
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:31,286
I've been searching everywhere
for you guys since we got separated.

759
01:11:31,369 --> 01:11:35,623
The sideburns are coming in nice, huh?
Got to be excited about that.

760
01:11:39,335 --> 01:11:42,088
Anyhow, I just wanted to say
I shouldn't have split.

761
01:11:42,171 --> 01:11:47,635
The crown is all yours. I'll miss you,
but I think it's for the best.

762
01:11:49,304 --> 01:11:52,724
Holding out on us again, eh, Rider?

763
01:11:53,182 --> 01:11:56,102
- What?
- We heard you found something.

764
01:11:56,185 --> 01:11:59,063
Something much more valuable
than a crown.

765
01:12:00,064 --> 01:12:02,901
We want her instead.

766
01:12:13,161 --> 01:12:16,414
I was starting to think you ran off
with the crown and left me.

767
01:12:23,463 --> 01:12:25,089
He did.

768
01:12:25,214 --> 01:12:28,426
What? No. He wouldn't.

769
01:12:29,385 --> 01:12:31,054
See for yourself.

770
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:37,018
Eugene?

771
01:12:39,729 --> 01:12:41,648
Eugene!

772
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:48,863
A fair trade. A crown
for the girl with the magic hair.

773
01:12:50,073 --> 01:12:53,868
How much do you think someone would
pay to stay young and healthy forever?

774
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:56,871
No. Please. No!

775
01:13:06,464 --> 01:13:07,757
Rapunzel!

776
01:13:09,467 --> 01:13:10,885
Mother?

777
01:13:15,765 --> 01:13:18,267
Oh, my precious girl!

778
01:13:19,143 --> 01:13:20,395
Mother.

779
01:13:20,937 --> 01:13:23,314
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

780
01:13:23,398 --> 01:13:26,943
- How did you...
- I was so worried about you, dear.

781
01:13:27,026 --> 01:13:30,571
So I followed you.
And I saw them attack you and...

782
01:13:30,655 --> 01:13:33,324
Oh, my. Let's go before they come to!

783
01:14:03,521 --> 01:14:07,483
You were right, Mother.
You were right about everything.

784
01:14:08,651 --> 01:14:12,030
I know, darling. I know.

785
01:14:25,877 --> 01:14:26,961
Look!

786
01:14:27,545 --> 01:14:28,921
The crown!

787
01:14:35,219 --> 01:14:37,972
No! Wait, guys!

788
01:15:01,788 --> 01:15:03,915
Let's get this over with, Rider.

789
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,335
Where are we going?

790
01:15:15,176 --> 01:15:17,929
There. It never happened.

791
01:15:20,181 --> 01:15:25,103
Now, wash up for dinner.
I'm making hazelnut soup.

792
01:15:29,732 --> 01:15:34,904
I really did try, Rapunzel.
I tried to warn you what was out there.

793
01:15:35,571 --> 01:15:40,034
The world is dark and selfish and cruel.

794
01:15:40,118 --> 01:15:43,121
If it finds
even the slightest ray of sunshine,

795
01:15:44,038 --> 01:15:45,790
it destroys it.

796
01:17:28,517 --> 01:17:30,686
How did you know about her?
Tell me, now!

797
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:33,606
It wasn't us! It was the old lady!

798
01:17:33,689 --> 01:17:34,941
Old lady?

799
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,569
Wait. No! Wait!

800
01:17:38,653 --> 01:17:41,572
You don't understand!
She's in trouble! Wait!

801
01:17:44,784 --> 01:17:46,577
What's going on up there?

802
01:17:50,748 --> 01:17:52,416
Are you all right?

803
01:17:53,751 --> 01:17:55,294
I'm the lost princess.

804
01:17:55,962 --> 01:17:59,173
Please speak up, Rapunzel.
You know how I hate the mumbling.

805
01:17:59,257 --> 01:18:03,844
I am the lost princess. Aren't I?

806
01:18:06,013 --> 01:18:08,266
Did I mumble, Mother?

807
01:18:09,433 --> 01:18:11,936
Or should I even call you that?

808
01:18:13,187 --> 01:18:16,023
Rapunzel, do you even hear yourself?

809
01:18:16,107 --> 01:18:18,818
Why would you ask
such a ridiculous question?

810
01:18:18,901 --> 01:18:22,363
It was you! It was all you!

811
01:18:24,448 --> 01:18:27,952
Everything I did was to protect you.

812
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:35,126
I've spent my entire life hiding from
people who would use me for my power

813
01:18:36,127 --> 01:18:39,130
when I should have been hiding
from you!

814
01:18:39,213 --> 01:18:42,508
Where will you go?
He won't be there for you.

815
01:18:42,591 --> 01:18:44,468
What did you do to him?

816
01:18:44,969 --> 01:18:48,222
That criminal is to be hanged
for his crimes.

817
01:18:49,307 --> 01:18:51,726
- No.
- Now, now, it's all right.

818
01:18:51,809 --> 01:18:56,397
Listen to me.
All of this is as it should be.

819
01:18:56,814 --> 01:19:00,318
No! You were wrong about the world.

820
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:03,362
And you were wrong about me!

821
01:19:03,446 --> 01:19:07,491
And I will never
let you use my hair again!

822
01:19:16,625 --> 01:19:19,086
You want me to be the bad guy?

823
01:19:19,170 --> 01:19:23,007
Fine, now I'm the bad guy.

824
01:19:37,188 --> 01:19:38,773
What's this?

825
01:19:38,856 --> 01:19:40,691
Open up!

826
01:19:41,734 --> 01:19:43,778
- What's the password?
- What?

827
01:19:43,861 --> 01:19:46,113
- Nope.
- Open this door!

828
01:19:46,197 --> 01:19:48,032
Not even close!

829
01:19:48,199 --> 01:19:50,951
You have three seconds! One...

830
01:19:51,869 --> 01:19:53,245
Two...

831
01:19:55,164 --> 01:19:56,207
Three.

832
01:20:01,754 --> 01:20:04,048
Frying pans! Who knew, right?

833
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:34,829
- Head down.
- Head down.

834
01:20:34,912 --> 01:20:35,996
- Arms in.
- Arms in.

835
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,748
- Knees apart.
- Knees apart. Knees apart?

836
01:20:38,916 --> 01:20:40,751
Why do I need
to keep my knees apart...

837
01:20:48,926 --> 01:20:52,138
Max! You brought them here?

838
01:20:54,348 --> 01:20:55,391
Thank you.

839
01:20:56,809 --> 01:20:59,437
No, really. Thank you.

840
01:21:01,355 --> 01:21:02,690
I feel maybe this whole time,

841
01:21:02,773 --> 01:21:04,692
we've just been misunderstanding
one another,

842
01:21:04,775 --> 01:21:06,485
and we're really just...

843
01:21:06,861 --> 01:21:08,154
You're right, we should go.

844
01:21:15,786 --> 01:21:16,829
Max?

845
01:21:30,593 --> 01:21:33,762
Okay, Max.
Let's see how fast you can run.

846
01:21:53,073 --> 01:21:54,241
Rapunzel?

847
01:21:56,243 --> 01:21:57,828
Rapunzel, let down your hair!

848
01:22:13,552 --> 01:22:16,514
Rapunzel,
I thought I'd never see you again.

849
01:22:24,647 --> 01:22:27,566
Now look what you've done, Rapunzel.

850
01:22:27,650 --> 01:22:31,987
Oh, don't worry, dear.
Our secret will die with him.

851
01:22:33,697 --> 01:22:35,282
And as for us...

852
01:22:36,617 --> 01:22:41,247
We are going where no one
will ever find you again.

853
01:22:47,336 --> 01:22:49,004
Rapunzel, really!

854
01:22:49,838 --> 01:22:53,467
Enough already! Stop fighting me!

855
01:22:54,093 --> 01:22:56,136
No! I won't stop!

856
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:59,431
For every minute of the rest of my life,
I will fight!

857
01:22:59,515 --> 01:23:03,394
I will never stop trying
to get away from you!

858
01:23:05,813 --> 01:23:10,359
But if you let me save him,
I will go with you.

859
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:14,071
No! No, Rapunzel.

860
01:23:14,947 --> 01:23:18,200
I'll never run. I'll never try to escape.

861
01:23:18,284 --> 01:23:21,870
Just let me heal him
and you and I will be together,

862
01:23:21,954 --> 01:23:23,998
forever, just like you want.

863
01:23:24,081 --> 01:23:26,083
Everything will be the way it was.

864
01:23:27,418 --> 01:23:28,544
I promise.

865
01:23:29,461 --> 01:23:31,255
Just like you want.

866
01:23:34,258 --> 01:23:37,595
Just let me heal him.

867
01:23:43,142 --> 01:23:46,520
In case you get any ideas
about following us.

868
01:23:56,739 --> 01:23:59,158
I'm so sorry.
Everything is going to be okay, though.

869
01:23:59,241 --> 01:24:00,242
No, Rapunzel.

870
01:24:00,326 --> 01:24:03,704
I promise. You have to trust me.
Come on. Just breathe.

871
01:24:03,787 --> 01:24:05,456
I can't let you do this.

872
01:24:06,123 --> 01:24:08,250
And I can't let you die.

873
01:24:08,792 --> 01:24:12,463
But if you do then you will die.

874
01:24:12,546 --> 01:24:16,258
Hey. It's going to be all right.

875
01:24:23,557 --> 01:24:24,683
Wait.

876
01:24:33,609 --> 01:24:34,860
Eugene...

877
01:24:35,819 --> 01:24:36,987
No!

878
01:24:45,162 --> 01:24:48,791
What have you done?
What have you done?

879
01:25:27,705 --> 01:25:29,581
No, no, no. Eugene.

880
01:25:32,334 --> 01:25:36,714
No! Look at me. I'm right here.
Don't go. Stay with me.

881
01:25:37,297 --> 01:25:40,384
Flower, gleam and glow
Let your power shine

882
01:25:40,467 --> 01:25:43,762
Make the clock reverse
Bring back what once was mine

883
01:25:44,972 --> 01:25:46,056
What?

884
01:25:49,727 --> 01:25:51,603
You were my new dream.

885
01:25:54,898 --> 01:25:56,650
And you were mine.

886
01:26:23,010 --> 01:26:26,513
Heal what has been hurt

887
01:26:27,931 --> 01:26:31,560
Change the Fates' design

888
01:26:32,603 --> 01:26:35,689
Save what has been lost

889
01:26:38,317 --> 01:26:41,153
Bring back what once was mine

890
01:26:44,615 --> 01:26:46,575
What once was mine

891
01:27:44,049 --> 01:27:45,509
Rapunzel?

892
01:27:46,510 --> 01:27:47,886
Eugene?

893
01:27:49,930 --> 01:27:52,891
Did I ever tell you
I've got a thing for brunettes?

894
01:29:35,827 --> 01:29:39,122
Well, you can imagine
what happened next.

895
01:29:41,583 --> 01:29:45,170
The kingdom rejoiced,
for their lost princess had returned.

896
01:29:45,253 --> 01:29:49,967
The party lasted an entire week, and
honestly I don't remember most of it.

897
01:29:50,801 --> 01:29:52,594
Dreams came true all over the place.

898
01:29:52,678 --> 01:29:55,973
That guy went on to become the most
famous concert pianist in the world,

899
01:29:56,056 --> 01:29:57,724
if you can believe it!

900
01:29:59,309 --> 01:30:02,688
And this guy?
He eventually found true love.

901
01:30:03,647 --> 01:30:07,818
As for this guy, I assume he's happy.
He's never told me otherwise.

902
01:30:10,028 --> 01:30:11,113
Thanks to Maximus,

903
01:30:11,196 --> 01:30:14,282
crime in the kingdom
disappeared almost overnight.

904
01:30:15,826 --> 01:30:17,869
As did most of the apples.

905
01:30:19,621 --> 01:30:22,499
Pascal never changed.

906
01:30:26,586 --> 01:30:30,590
At last Rapunzel was home.
And she finally had a real family.

907
01:30:32,342 --> 01:30:34,928
She was a princess worth waiting for.

908
01:30:35,012 --> 01:30:38,473
Beloved by all, she led her kingdom
with all the grace and wisdom

909
01:30:38,557 --> 01:30:40,017
that her parents did before her.

910
01:30:41,351 --> 01:30:44,479
And, as for me,
I started going by Eugene again,

911
01:30:44,563 --> 01:30:46,690
stopped thieving
and turned it all around.

912
01:30:46,773 --> 01:30:49,317
But I know what the big question is.

913
01:30:49,401 --> 01:30:51,570
Did Rapunzel and I ever get married?

914
01:30:51,653 --> 01:30:52,779
I'm pleased to tell you

915
01:30:52,863 --> 01:30:57,242
that after years and years
of asking and asking and asking...

916
01:30:59,369 --> 01:31:01,246
I finally said yes.

917
01:31:01,329 --> 01:31:05,625
- Eugene.
- All right, I asked her.

918
01:31:05,709 --> 01:31:08,170
And we're living happily ever after.

919
01:31:08,837 --> 01:31:10,297
Yes, we are.
