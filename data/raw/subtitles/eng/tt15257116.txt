They're arseholes
for leaving you.

They're just dumb sometimes.

206
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:56,781
Well, I think you're a
lot more mature than them.

207

I don't even know anyone
that goes to another school.

What does that mean?

Like hashtag BRB,
chasing sunsets.

don't like sunsets.

to do after high school?

I haven't really
thought about it.

It's okay.

326
00:25:24,696 --> 00:25:26,218
I definitely didn't
know what I wanted to do

00:25:26,219 --> 00:25:29,571
when I was your age,
you don't have to.

328

what I'm interested in.

me get into college.

00:25:44,237 --> 00:25:46,412
Do you want to go to college?

332
00:25:46,413 --> 00:25:47,631
I mean, no offense to your mom.

333
00:25:47,632 --> 00:25:49,154
I'm sure she's a
really nice person,

334
00:25:49,155 --> 00:25:52,244
but she might not know
what she's talking about.

335
00:25:52,245 --> 00:25:53,898
You know, there's a
lot of different ways

336
00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:55,422
to live a good life,

337
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:59,251
and you don't have to go
to college to do that.

338
00:25:59,252 --> 00:26:03,255
I live my life any
way that I want,

339
00:26:03,256 --> 00:26:06,259
and I don't have to listen
to anybody else to do that.

340
00:26:06,956 --> 00:26:09,915
And that is real freedom.

341
00:26:11,177 --> 00:26:12,396
Real freedom.

00:26:16,487 --> 00:26:17,488

No, I have a small business.

That's cool.

348
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:27,366
Yeah, I was pretty good at
building stuff to start.

349
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:29,848
I work for myself, so
I set my own terms.

350
00:26:37,856 --> 00:26:39,988
I guess I like to
sing sometimes.

351
00:26:39,989 --> 00:26:41,293
Oh yeah.

352
00:26:41,294 --> 00:26:43,382
Well, maybe you
should quit smoking

353
00:26:43,383 --> 00:26:45,429
so you can save your voice.

354
00:26:46,212 --> 00:26:47,386
I only smoke sometimes.

355
00:26:47,387 --> 00:26:50,433
Sure, you do, smoker.

356
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:53,523
Hey, besides tons of
singers of raspy voices.

357
00:26:53,524 --> 00:26:55,046
Yeah, that's true.

Still, hold on a sec.

00:27:02,707 --> 00:27:05,840
Hey, why don't you
sing me something?

00:27:05,841 --> 00:27:06,884
No.

Come on, please.

00:27:08,887 --> 00:27:09,714
Absolutely.

Why not?

I wanna hear you.

No, all right.

sing at some point.

00:48:09,581 --> 00:48:11,408
This is my friend.

559
00:48:11,409 --> 00:48:12,932
Tom.

560
00:48:12,933 --> 00:48:13,933
Emma.

561
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,807
We were just about
to head out actually.

562
00:48:18,808 --> 00:48:20,504
You sure you can't stick around?

563
00:48:20,505 --> 00:48:22,506
We're doing a bonfire later.

564
00:48:22,507 --> 00:48:25,293
Bonfire, sounds fun.

565
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:29,861
It will be, you should stay.

566
00:48:29,862 --> 00:48:30,862
Even if she can't.

567
00:48:30,863 --> 00:48:33,605
We really have to get going.

568
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:40,002
Too bad, another time then.

569
00:48:40,003 --> 00:48:41,613
Yeah, another time.

570
00:48:44,268 --> 00:48:46,008
Stop it Emma.

571
00:48:46,009 --> 00:48:47,705
So you're allowed to
hook up with Tyler

572
00:48:47,706 --> 00:48:49,839
and I'm not even
allowed to talk to Tom.

573
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:58,326
[person walking]

574
00:49:14,777 --> 00:49:15,777
Are you okay?

575
00:49:16,735 --> 00:49:18,085
Yeah, I'm fine.

576
00:49:30,053 --> 00:49:31,489
Why are you laughing?

577
00:49:33,752 --> 00:49:38,931
Because you are so cute
when you get jealous.

578
00:49:44,024 --> 00:49:45,763
I'm not jealous.

579
00:49:45,764 --> 00:49:48,331
No.

580
00:49:48,332 --> 00:49:53,250
Well that's a shame
because I'm jealous.

581
00:49:56,862 --> 00:49:57,862
Who's Tyler?

582
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:02,084
Who's Tyler?

583
00:50:02,085 --> 00:50:03,043
He's nobody.

584
00:50:03,044 --> 00:50:06,611
He's nobody, who's Tyler?

585
00:50:07,438 --> 00:50:08,439
I swear.

586
00:50:12,269 --> 00:50:16,969
I don't want to see other
guys, you understand?

587
00:50:18,101 --> 00:50:19,101
I'm not.

588
00:50:22,671 --> 00:50:27,850
Because you are,
you're mine, right?

589
00:50:37,468 --> 00:50:39,556
[people kissing]

590
00:50:39,557 --> 00:50:41,646
Good, get in the car.

591
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,306
[door banging]

592
00:50:50,307 --> 00:50:54,224
Yeah, these look well
moisturized and hydrated.

593
00:50:56,661 --> 00:51:01,666
These look like certified
genuine princess hands.

594
00:51:04,669 --> 00:51:05,930
[person laughing]

595
00:51:05,931 --> 00:51:07,454
I don't know if that's
a compliment or not.

596
00:51:07,455 --> 00:51:08,716
It's a compliment.

597
00:51:08,717 --> 00:51:10,761
Thank you, you're like.

598
00:51:10,762 --> 00:51:13,983
[person knocking]

599
00:51:18,944 --> 00:51:20,380
Who is that?

600
00:51:20,381 --> 00:51:23,732
It's just a friend.

601
00:51:25,037 --> 00:51:27,649
Hold on a sec, gimme a minute.

602
00:51:31,043 --> 00:51:32,915
I'll be right back.

603
00:51:35,613 --> 00:51:37,659
Shut your fucking mouth.

604
00:51:38,616 --> 00:51:41,315
[door whirring]

605
00:52:36,108 --> 00:52:37,718
Outta here.

606
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:40,461
Just get the fuck out right now.

607
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:43,594
You don't want me.

608
00:53:11,143 --> 00:53:12,362
I'm sorry about that.

609
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:14,669
Is everything okay?

610
00:53:15,713 --> 00:53:19,369
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

611
00:53:20,457 --> 00:53:21,588
What's going on?

612
00:53:21,589 --> 00:53:22,719
[water gushing]

613
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,244
My friend needed something.

614
00:53:26,463 --> 00:53:28,072
Your friend lives here?

615
00:53:28,073 --> 00:53:32,904
Yeah, she just need a little
bit of help with something.

616
00:53:33,644 --> 00:53:35,297
What kind of help?

617
00:53:35,298 --> 00:53:39,824
With a guy, with a
guy that she's seeing.

618
00:53:41,913 --> 00:53:43,263
Like her boyfriend?

619
00:53:44,002 --> 00:53:44,829
Yeah, yeah.

620
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:45,917
Like her boyfriend.

621
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:55,926
Why won't you tell
me what's going on?

622
00:53:55,927 --> 00:53:56,841
I am telling you
what's going on.

623
00:53:56,842 --> 00:53:58,626
There's nothing to worry about.

624
00:54:00,018 --> 00:54:02,760
It's her boyfriend and
he's drunk sometimes.

625
00:54:17,949 --> 00:54:21,039
[people sighing]

626
00:54:23,346 --> 00:54:24,346
Okay.

627
00:54:33,922 --> 00:54:36,793
[Speaker 6] I just wanna
reiterate, I like to use.

628
00:54:36,794 --> 00:54:39,056
[door knocking]

629
00:54:39,057 --> 00:54:42,147
Natural aid when
we do this part.

630
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:51,895
Hey.

631
00:54:51,896 --> 00:54:54,158
So you haven't been
answering any of my texts.

632
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:57,032
Sorry I'm not glued to my phone.

633
00:54:57,728 --> 00:54:58,989
Where's your mom?

634
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:00,165
At work.

635
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:08,391
So Emma said she saw you
at the beach with some guy,

636
00:55:09,871 --> 00:55:11,829
an old guy named Tom.

637
00:55:16,834 --> 00:55:18,182
He's not that old.

638
00:55:18,183 --> 00:55:19,968
No way, so, it's true.

639
00:55:21,056 --> 00:55:23,232
Okay, is Emma telling everybody?

640
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:25,930
She said, she was
just telling me.

641
00:55:27,018 --> 00:55:29,585
You just have to promise
not to tell anybody.

642
00:55:29,586 --> 00:55:30,847
Yeah, obviously.

643
00:55:30,848 --> 00:55:33,111
But like, why
didn't you tell me?

644
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:38,987
I was going to, I'm sorry.

645
00:55:40,075 --> 00:55:42,077
You just have to swear
not to tell anybody.

646
00:55:43,252 --> 00:55:45,515
I mean, yeah, as long as
you tell me everything.

647
00:55:47,038 --> 00:55:48,649
Okay, pinky swear.

648
00:55:51,608 --> 00:55:52,608
Kiss it.

649
00:55:54,611 --> 00:55:56,873
[person kissing]

650
00:55:56,874 --> 00:55:58,049
It's really good.

651
00:55:59,573 --> 00:56:01,096
It's not really good.

652
00:56:01,879 --> 00:56:03,533
It's what we got.

653
00:56:04,969 --> 00:56:06,448
Really?

654
00:56:06,449 --> 00:56:08,232
Yeah, I mean, you don't
know a good piece of pizza

655
00:56:08,233 --> 00:56:13,369
until you've gotten a
slice in New York City.

656
00:56:14,675 --> 00:56:15,718
Maybe you'll have to
take me to New York then.

657
00:56:15,719 --> 00:56:17,068
Show me the good stuff.

658
00:56:18,896 --> 00:56:20,463
You want me to take you away?

659
00:56:21,421 --> 00:56:23,031
You wanna run away with me?

660
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:26,860
Maybe.

661
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:33,780
Oh, give me a minute.

662
00:56:33,781 --> 00:56:36,523
[phone buzzing]

663
00:56:37,828 --> 00:56:38,828
Hello.

664
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:42,485
[bell ringing]

665
00:56:50,101 --> 00:56:51,841
Everything okay over here?

666
00:56:51,842 --> 00:56:52,842
It's great.

667
00:56:54,497 --> 00:56:55,497
Are you okay?

668
00:56:56,673 --> 00:56:58,195
Yeah.

669
00:56:58,196 --> 00:56:58,936
[person laughing]

670
00:56:58,936 --> 00:56:59,720
What do you mean?

671
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:00,720
Do you need help?

672
00:57:02,679 --> 00:57:05,028
There's a phone in the back,
I can make a call for you.

673
00:57:05,029 --> 00:57:06,683
He does not have to know.

674
00:57:09,773 --> 00:57:11,209
Doesn't have to know what?

675
00:57:12,646 --> 00:57:13,951
You can tell me.

676
00:57:14,561 --> 00:57:15,910
Tell you what?

677
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:24,134
Look, it's just he comes
in here with girls.

678
00:57:24,135 --> 00:57:26,136
I don't know what
you're talking about.

679
00:57:26,137 --> 00:57:27,138
He's my boyfriend.

680
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:33,796
[liquid pouring]

681
00:57:33,797 --> 00:57:38,062
Hey, can we get a box for that?

682
00:57:40,108 --> 00:57:43,893
Something came up, I
gotta take you home, okay?

683
00:57:43,894 --> 00:57:44,894
Okay.

684
00:57:46,114 --> 00:57:48,551
Good, I'm sorry.

685
00:57:49,291 --> 00:57:51,422
Got this draining issue

686
00:57:51,423 --> 00:57:53,207
and I should have
dealt with it myself

687
00:57:53,208 --> 00:57:55,819
instead of asking somebody
else to look after it.

688
00:57:57,212 --> 00:57:58,212
You all right?

689
00:58:00,389 --> 00:58:03,914
Are you like dating other girls?

690
00:58:05,176 --> 00:58:09,485
No, why would you ask me that?

691
00:58:11,008 --> 00:58:11,748
I don't know.

692
00:58:11,748 --> 00:58:12,748
What?

693
00:58:14,751 --> 00:58:16,318
It's just that the waitress.

694
00:58:18,015 --> 00:58:19,581
This waitress?

695
00:58:19,582 --> 00:58:23,280
Yeah, she said that she sees
you there with other girls.

696
00:58:23,281 --> 00:58:24,804
So.

697
00:58:24,805 --> 00:58:27,241
I've never seen this waitress
before in my entire life.

698
00:58:27,242 --> 00:58:31,551
So she's definitely confusing
me with somebody else, okay.

699
00:58:33,248 --> 00:58:34,553
Okay, just forget it.

700
00:58:34,554 --> 00:58:35,858
Leah.

701
00:58:35,859 --> 00:58:37,773
Hold on a sec, will you
take this for a second?

702
00:58:37,774 --> 00:58:39,122
Let me just clear this up.

703
00:58:39,123 --> 00:58:40,210
I've never seen this, hold on.

704
00:58:40,211 --> 00:58:42,474
Tom, don't.

705
00:58:43,998 --> 00:58:44,998
One sec.

706
00:59:13,767 --> 00:59:15,246
She apologized.

707
00:59:18,815 --> 00:59:19,815
Okay.

708
00:59:21,862 --> 00:59:22,906
Just take me home.

709
00:59:28,608 --> 00:59:32,654
You know I really don't
appreciate this, Leah.

710
00:59:32,655 --> 00:59:35,918
I mean what have I ever done

711
00:59:35,919 --> 00:59:37,921
to give you a reason
not to trust me?

712
00:59:39,836 --> 00:59:40,836
Nothing.

713
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:44,840
You trust me?

714
00:59:46,364 --> 00:59:47,364
Yeah.

715
00:59:48,149 --> 00:59:49,149
Yeah.

716
00:59:50,194 --> 00:59:52,719
I want to hear you say it.

717
00:59:55,112 --> 00:59:56,199
What?

718
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,855
I want you to say, I trust you.

719
01:00:02,772 --> 01:00:03,860
I trust you.

720
01:00:09,649 --> 01:00:10,650
I trust you too.

721
01:00:13,174 --> 01:00:16,177
[door banging]

722
01:00:25,229 --> 01:00:27,405
There you are, I haven't
seen you in days.

723
01:00:28,232 --> 01:00:30,712
Yep, I'm here.

724
01:00:30,713 --> 01:00:33,542
What have you been up to?

725
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,503
You wanna watch
something on TV tonight?

726
01:00:39,287 --> 01:00:41,114
I'm hanging out with Amber.

727
01:00:41,115 --> 01:00:42,942
Aw, I think you've been spending

728
01:00:42,943 --> 01:00:44,553
so much time with her lately.

729
01:00:45,641 --> 01:00:46,642
Not really.

730
01:00:47,991 --> 01:00:51,473
Well, we haven't been
spending any time together.

731
01:00:52,604 --> 01:00:54,476
I'm surprised you even noticed.

732
01:00:56,086 --> 01:00:58,305
It's not like you've
been around much anyways.

733
01:00:58,306 --> 01:01:00,700
Of course I noticed, stop it.

734
01:01:04,921 --> 01:01:05,921
Geez.

735
01:01:12,276 --> 01:01:15,366
So which one of your boyfriends
dumped you this time?

736
01:01:16,193 --> 01:01:17,368
Or was it all of them?

737
01:01:23,287 --> 01:01:25,288
What's the matter with you?

738
01:01:25,289 --> 01:01:26,464
It's fine.

739
01:01:28,292 --> 01:01:30,380
I know I'll always come second.

740
01:01:30,381 --> 01:01:31,165
It's whatever.

741
01:01:31,166 --> 01:01:32,339
You're my daughter.

742
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:33,254
Of course you come first.

743
01:01:33,255 --> 01:01:35,343
Are you fucking kidding me?

744
01:01:40,478 --> 01:01:43,481
Some people have no
business having kids.

745
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:47,485
Excuse me?

746
01:01:49,444 --> 01:01:52,969
I said that some people have
no business having kids.

747
01:01:58,235 --> 01:02:01,150
He gets them ball, puts on back

748
01:02:01,151 --> 01:02:03,152
and hits it while he's
fucking from behind.

749
01:02:03,153 --> 01:02:05,459
I'm dead ass, I'm
fucking dead ass.

750
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:08,418
Bro, come on that's
fucking bullshit.

751
01:02:08,419 --> 01:02:10,681
Dude, that is not even
anatomically possible.

752
01:02:10,682 --> 01:02:12,335
All right, look,

753
01:02:12,336 --> 01:02:14,250
I'm just telling
you what he told me

754
01:02:14,251 --> 01:02:15,991
and he told me he's
done it a bunch.

755
01:02:15,992 --> 01:02:17,819
Yeah well, he's a fucking liar.

756
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:20,082
Jared, you're just jealous.

757
01:02:20,083 --> 01:02:21,475
I'm not jealous.

758
01:02:21,476 --> 01:02:23,346
[person laughing]

759
01:02:23,347 --> 01:02:26,785
So Leah, who you've been up to?

760
01:02:26,786 --> 01:02:28,351
Shut up Pat.

761
01:02:28,352 --> 01:02:30,049
You don't need to
answer that Leah.

762
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:31,878
We all know what
you've been up to.

763
01:02:34,097 --> 01:02:35,271
Oh, come on.

764
01:02:35,272 --> 01:02:36,838
Don't gimme that confused look,

765
01:02:36,839 --> 01:02:39,798
we all know that you've been
hanging out with the geriatric.

766
01:02:39,799 --> 01:02:41,148
Jared you asshole.

767
01:02:42,192 --> 01:02:46,021
Leah, I didn't mean
to say anything.

768
01:02:46,022 --> 01:02:48,502
And they said that they
would never repeat it.

769
01:02:48,503 --> 01:02:50,634
I promise, I'm sorry.

770
01:02:50,635 --> 01:02:52,550
Leah, the man is a pervert.

771
01:02:54,117 --> 01:02:55,161
No he's not.

772
01:02:55,162 --> 01:02:56,380
He's a pedophile.

773
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,252
I don't blame him, I mean,

774
01:02:59,253 --> 01:03:01,210
we all know younger
girls feel different.

775
01:03:01,211 --> 01:03:03,125
Ew Patrick.

776
01:03:03,126 --> 01:03:04,474
[people laughing]

777
01:03:04,475 --> 01:03:05,041
You don't know what
you're talking about.

778
01:03:05,042 --> 01:03:06,389
Yes, I do.

779
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:07,913
I literally fucked
that older lady.

780
01:03:07,914 --> 01:03:09,566
She was like in her forties,

781
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,481
but she actually was kind
of hot, to be honest.

782
01:03:10,482 --> 01:03:11,830
Disgusting Patrick.

783
01:03:11,831 --> 01:03:12,570
No, you didn't.

784
01:03:12,571 --> 01:03:14,223
Yes I did.

785
01:03:14,224 --> 01:03:15,790
No, you didn't.

786
01:03:15,791 --> 01:03:16,487
On that trip with my family
to Mexico, I told you about.

787
01:03:16,488 --> 01:03:17,966
I swear to God, bro.

788
01:03:17,967 --> 01:03:20,142
I'm not a kidding, older
women, they feel different.

789
01:03:20,143 --> 01:03:21,143
It's like not as good.

790
01:03:21,144 --> 01:03:22,579
I think it like,

791
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:24,233
it like stretches out
over time or something.

792
01:03:24,234 --> 01:03:26,670
[Speaker 7] I'm
too high for this.

793
01:03:26,671 --> 01:03:28,672
[Speaker 6] I'm just saying
like, this guy's lucky.

794
01:03:28,673 --> 01:03:30,850
Did you shut the
fuck up, Patrick.

795
01:03:31,589 --> 01:03:32,764
You're disgusting.

796
01:03:33,896 --> 01:03:36,072
It's just a joke,
those old saggy balls.

797
01:03:37,465 --> 01:03:38,769
Leah.

798
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:40,162
Leave me alone.

799
01:03:40,163 --> 01:03:42,209
Oh my God, Leah.

800
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:44,514
Get off of me.

801
01:03:44,515 --> 01:03:45,776
I'm sorry, okay.

802
01:03:45,777 --> 01:03:47,169
Geez, they just kept
asking where you were.

803
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:48,519
You didn't need to say anything.

804
01:03:50,521 --> 01:03:51,782
Can't you see how much

805
01:03:51,783 --> 01:03:53,742
they don't even wanna
hang out with you?

806
01:03:54,569 --> 01:03:56,571
They know you'll
fuck any of them.

807
01:03:58,007 --> 01:03:59,573
They just keep you around
for when one of them decides

808
01:03:59,574 --> 01:04:00,880
that they feel like it.

809
01:04:04,361 --> 01:04:07,364
[door knocking]

810
01:04:25,643 --> 01:04:26,905
I'm sorry about earlier.

811
01:04:26,906 --> 01:04:29,604
[person crying]

812
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,135
[door banging]

[footsteps walking]

[person sniffing]

815
01:04:52,757 --> 01:04:54,194
What's wrong?

816
01:04:59,939 --> 01:05:00,939
Okay.

817
01:05:02,506 --> 01:05:03,638
I hate them.

818
01:05:05,509 --> 01:05:09,165
Oh, well, they never matter.

819
01:05:11,515 --> 01:05:13,039
They never matter, right?

820
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,783
You're the only
person I even like.

821
01:05:20,524 --> 01:05:21,569
Oh, good.

822
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:25,834
'Cause that's all
we need, right?

823
01:05:27,183 --> 01:05:28,228
You and me.

824
01:05:34,451 --> 01:05:37,237
And this perfect fucking face.

825
01:05:56,647 --> 01:05:58,867
You know I love you, right?

826
01:06:00,738 --> 01:06:02,218
And you love me,

827
01:06:07,658 --> 01:06:10,618
and you're never gonna leave me.

828
01:06:13,012 --> 01:06:14,709
I won't leave you.

829
01:06:16,189 --> 01:06:17,189
Good.

830
01:06:18,843 --> 01:06:23,065
Because nobody loves you
the way that I love you.

831
01:06:27,852 --> 01:06:29,506
Hold on a second.

832
01:06:38,907 --> 01:06:40,474
I made you this.

833
01:06:54,401 --> 01:06:56,706
[person laughing]

834
01:06:56,707 --> 01:07:00,362
Oh my God.

835
01:07:00,363 --> 01:07:03,800
Dear me chasing the sunset.

836
01:07:03,801 --> 01:07:05,106
I thought you'd like it.

837
01:07:05,107 --> 01:07:06,716
You had this made?

838
01:07:06,717 --> 01:07:09,545
Yeah, of course I did for you.

839
01:07:09,546 --> 01:07:10,330
Oh my God.

840
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:11,113
Put it on.

841
01:07:11,114 --> 01:07:12,418
I love it.

842
01:07:12,419 --> 01:07:14,115
Put it on, I wanna
see it on your wrist.

843
01:07:14,116 --> 01:07:15,551
I'm gonna wear it all the time.

844
01:07:15,552 --> 01:07:18,729
Good, come here.

845
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:29,739
I wanted to get you something

846
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:32,091
so you could think of me
when we can't be together.

847
01:07:33,744 --> 01:07:35,833
I wish we could be
together all the time,

848
01:07:37,574 --> 01:07:39,881
and I never have to
deal with anybody else.

849
01:07:45,452 --> 01:07:48,803
Then let's go be alone
together someplace,

850
01:07:50,152 --> 01:07:51,632
just for a few days.

851
01:07:54,156 --> 01:07:55,156
Really?

852
01:07:55,157 --> 01:07:56,505
Yeah, I think we
need a vacation.

853
01:07:56,506 --> 01:08:00,902
I think we just need
to be the two of us.

854
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:05,689
Can we leave tonight?

855
01:08:07,691 --> 01:08:09,606
We can leave tomorrow.

856
01:08:12,043 --> 01:08:13,697
How's that sound?

857
01:08:17,048 --> 01:08:18,048
Okay.

858
01:08:18,049 --> 01:08:20,965
[gentle music]

859
01:08:50,691 --> 01:08:51,691
[door whirring]

860
01:08:51,692 --> 01:08:52,910
Oh boy.

861
01:09:14,323 --> 01:09:16,411
If somebody had told you
that night at the diner

862
01:09:16,412 --> 01:09:19,894
where we'd be now, what
would you have thought?

863
01:09:22,853 --> 01:09:25,507
I would've thought that
there's just no way

864
01:09:25,508 --> 01:09:28,903
that I could be this lucky.

865
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,036
Really?

866
01:09:33,037 --> 01:09:35,910
[Speaker 8] Really,
what about you?

867
01:09:39,218 --> 01:09:40,696
I just never thought
somebody like you

868
01:09:40,697 --> 01:09:42,221
would even be into me.

869
01:09:48,966 --> 01:09:50,968
I wanted you the first
moment I saw you.

870
01:10:04,895 --> 01:10:10,031
And I've been thinking
about some things

871
01:10:13,295 --> 01:10:16,385
about you and everything,
and about your mom,

872
01:10:18,474 --> 01:10:21,347
and I wanna be the one to
take care of you from now on.

873
01:10:24,088 --> 01:10:25,176
What do you mean?

874
01:10:26,265 --> 01:10:28,049
I mean, I want it
to be you and me.

875
01:10:30,094 --> 01:10:32,096
I wanna be the
one to protect you

876
01:10:33,141 --> 01:10:35,403
and to give you
everything that you need.

877
01:10:35,404 --> 01:10:38,798
I wanna be that guy
so that you don't have

878
01:10:38,799 --> 01:10:40,670
to get help from anybody else.

879
01:10:46,937 --> 01:10:48,112
Yeah.

880
01:10:59,123 --> 01:11:03,345
And that can start, right now.

881
01:11:07,958 --> 01:11:11,005

883
01:11:17,969 --> 01:11:19,492
Stand up, come over here.

884
01:11:20,971 --> 01:11:21,971
Right here.

885
01:11:22,973 --> 01:11:26,150
[person laughing]

886
01:11:31,808 --> 01:11:32,808
Take this off.

887
01:11:38,162 --> 01:11:40,250
I can't go close to the blind.

888
01:11:40,251 --> 01:11:42,123
No, no, no, no, no.

889
01:11:44,168 --> 01:11:45,648
I wanna see you.

890
01:12:06,756 --> 01:12:07,756
No.

891
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:51,497
Take these off.

892
01:13:31,275 --> 01:13:32,625
Take that off.

893
01:13:42,112 --> 01:13:43,287
Turn around.

894
01:13:48,597 --> 01:13:50,512
You get on your knees.

895
01:13:56,126 --> 01:13:59,086
[belt whirring]

896
01:14:04,134 --> 01:14:06,136
No, with your mouth.

Thank you.

904
01:15:23,083 --> 01:15:25,564

What are you doing?

908
01:15:38,054 --> 01:15:41,231
I'm just straightening up.

[person sighing]

910
01:16:08,824 --> 01:16:09,824
Come over here.

911
01:16:13,002 --> 01:16:15,701
I need your help with something.

912
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:20,182
Okay.

913
01:16:20,183 --> 01:16:22,055
I need you to do
something for us.

914
01:16:23,273 --> 01:16:24,273
Okay.

915
01:16:26,363 --> 01:16:31,542
There's a guy that
wants to meet you.

916
01:16:35,764 --> 01:16:39,420
So I have arranged for
him to meet you tonight.

917
01:16:44,207 --> 01:16:47,515
Do you remember

918
01:16:49,212 --> 01:16:52,651
what a good time we
had when we got here?

919
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:04,358
I want you to show
him a good time.

920
01:17:08,710 --> 01:17:09,710
Do you remember?

921
01:17:13,149 --> 01:17:14,411
It's just like that.

922
01:17:27,076 --> 01:17:28,512
I don't wanna do that.

923
01:17:35,171 --> 01:17:37,433
You told me that you want
me to take care of you.

924
01:17:37,434 --> 01:17:39,959
This is how I would
take care of you.

925
01:17:48,271 --> 01:17:50,447
I don't wanna do that.

926
01:18:07,290 --> 01:18:12,469
You said that you wanted it
to just be the two of us.

927
01:18:16,473 --> 01:18:18,648
So I need you to do this

928
01:18:18,649 --> 01:18:21,565
because we're gonna need money.

929
01:18:36,972 --> 01:18:39,496
I don't think I can do that.

931
01:18:44,414 --> 01:18:48,897

you're so fucking good at it.

He and I have talked
about everything.

936

worry about, okay?

937

time to do it then.
