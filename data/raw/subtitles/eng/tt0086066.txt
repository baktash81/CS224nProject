00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,760
{y:i}"When I stepped out...

2
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,472
{y:i}"...into the bright sunlight...

3
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,476
{y:i}"...from the darkness
{y:i}of the movie house...."

4
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,669
What's going on?

5
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,880
We're early.

6
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,299
What do you want to do?

7
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,387
Nothing legal. Let's get out of here.

8
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,699
-How're you doing, Bill?
-Sharp!

9
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,868
Turn around! I've had it!

10
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,980
Here come the hobos.

11
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,482
I ain't got no cash....

12
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,693
Anyone want to buy a windshield wiper?

13
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,572
Give them the money.

14
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,074
What's the movie about?

15
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,162
I don't know.

16
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,789
It's one of those beach movies.

17
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:00,467
-Did I say you guys can play on my grass?
-No.

18
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,261
Then what are you doing here?

19
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,680
Give me those cards, will you?

20
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,896
-You guys ever play "52 Pick-Up"?
-Yeah.

21
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,397
What?

22
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,775
Don't get wise.

23
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,280
I don't like little kids,
I just don't like them.

24
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,286
Get out of here or I'll kill you!

25
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,592
The sky's getting dark. Let's go.

26
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,571
What do you think you're doing?

27
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:07,784
Cherry, just relax. You're supposed to be
my girlfriend, aren't you?

28
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,286
Don't ever pull anything like that again.

29
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,663
Are you serious?

30
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,373
Who do you think you are?

31
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,667
Don't do this to me.

32
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,670
I'm not going back there.

33
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:23,466
-I don't even understand.
-They just want to make it complicated.

34
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,567
Hey, baby, you want to see
what's hanging?

35
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,779
You're sure you want to do this?

36
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:47,365
I came to see a movie
and I'm gonna see a movie!

37
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,783
I'm freezing.

38
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:52,162
-Why didn't you bring a coat, stupid?
-I forgot.

39
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,384
Some cute redhead.

40
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,264
Are you a real redhead?

41
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,394
Are you real?

42
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,285
How can I find out
if this is your real red hair?

43
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:37,499
If this is the same red hair
that you have on these eyebrows, too?

44
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,465
Cut it out.

45
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,891
Get your feet off my chair
and shut your trap!

46
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,769
-Who's gonna make me?
-I'm gonna get a Coke.

47
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,187
Who, your boyfriend?

48
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,272
Leave her alone.

49
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,275
That's the Greaser who just
got out of jail.

50
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,069
Whatever you say.

51
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,697
Better leave us alone or
I'll call the cops.

52
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:13,284
You got me scared to death.
What am I gonna do, Pony?

53
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,579
This girl is making me shake.

54
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,667
Why don't you be nice and leave us alone?

55
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,794
I'm never nice.

56
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:27,465
Can I interest you in
a Coca-Cola or a 7Up?

57
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,175
Get lost, hood!

58
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,178
I'm sorry.

59
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:39,394
I didn't know you had this problem
of yelling in my face.

60
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,063
All right, I'll go.

61
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,274
I know when I'm not wanted.

62
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,576
You filthy Greaser!

63
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,463
Are you going to start now, too?

64
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,177
You don't look the type anyway.
What's your name?

65
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,595
Ponyboy Curtis.

66
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,265
That's an original name.

67
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:22,562
My dad was an original person.
I got a brother named Sodapop.

68
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,398
It says so on his birth certificate.

69
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:30,862
My name's Sherry, but my friends
call me Cherry because of my hair.

70
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,364
Yeah, I know.

71
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,783
We go to the same school.
You're a cheerleader.

72
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,994
You don't look old enough
to be going to high school.

73
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,998
What's a nice boy like you doing
hanging around with that trash?

74
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:45,085
Dal is my buddy. I'm a Greaser, too.

75
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,378
We're all friends.

76
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,171
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

77
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,886
Your brother, Sodapop,
he works at the gasoline station?

78
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,262
Yeah, that's him.

79
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:59,974
-Sodapop is cute.
-I should have known you were brothers.

80
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,398
How come we don't see your brother
at school anymore?

81
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:10,193
Has he been working full time
since your parents died?

82
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:13,780
-He's a dropout.
-That's too bad.

83
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,866
I thought this might cool you off.

84
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:25,083
Maybe that will cool you off
until you learn how to be decent.

85
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:26,960
Fiery, huh?

86
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,461
Just the way I like them!

87
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,879
Get off of me!

88
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,091
Leave her alone.

89
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,886
What did you say?

90
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,264
Come on, you heard me. Leave her alone.

91
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,768
-What did you say, you little shit?
-Come on.

92
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:45,895
Wise ass.

93
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,461
Thank you, he had me scared to death.

94
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:12,672
You didn't show it.
Nobody talks to Dal like that.

95
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,592
From what I saw, you do.

96
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,762
Why don't you sit with us to protect us?

97
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:22,766
-What do you think? Come on.
-Might as well.

98
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,898
How old are you?

99
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,691
-Fourteen.
-Sixteen.

100
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,985
I thought you were both fourteen.

101
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,990
Why aren't you scared of us
like you were of Dally?

102
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,868
You two are too sweet-looking.

103
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,580
Besides, I know about Dallas Winston.

104
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,166
You two don't look mean.

105
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,461
Right. We're young and innocent.

106
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,964
No, you're just not dirty.

107
00:11:56,091 --> 00:12:00,261
Dal is okay. He's tough and all,
but he's cool if you get to know him.

108
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:03,264
He'd leave you alone
if he knew who you were.

109
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,893
-I'm glad he doesn't know us.
-I kind of admire him.

110
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:16,194
-Get outta my hair!
-You gotta couple of hairs outta place!

111
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,863
Here, kid, have a beer.
It'll settle your nerves.

112
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,991
Well, now, who do we got here?
Your great-grandmothers?

113
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,579
What are you ladies doing
with these Greasers?

114
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,998
Dal was bothering them.

115
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:30,667
He was, huh?

116
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,460
Where is old Dal now anyway?

117
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,797
Yeah, where is Dally?

118
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,385
He left.

119
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,097
I know he slashed my tires!

120
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,768
Look, Tim, he left.
You guys seen Dally?

121
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,186
No.

122
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,691
I'll be looking for him.

123
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,281
-Dally got a blade?
-I don't think so.

124
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,575
Good. Tim will fight him fair.

125
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:10,665
-You guys don't play rough, do you?
-A fair fight ain't rough.

126
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,959
Yeah, real simple.

127
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,088
If he gets killed, you just bury him.
No sweat.

128
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,593
You dig okay. Want a chew?

129
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,597
Help yourself,
puts hair on your chest.

130
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:28,683
Come with me to get some Cokes
and popcorn.

131
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,685
Sure.

132
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,562
-Do you want some?
-I do.

133
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,899
Yeah, me, too. Get Johnny some, too.
I'm buying.

134
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,989
Is your friend with the sideburns okay?

135
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:46,576
He ain't as dangerous,
if that's what you mean.

136
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:52,665
He sure scared Johnny.

137
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:56,795
Johnny's a nervous wreck anyway.

138
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,881
He got beat up a few months ago
by some Soc.

139
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,760
That's how he got his scar?

140
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,179
Yeah, the guy was wearing rings.

141
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,767
We're not all like that.

142
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,479
That's like saying all Greasers
are like Dallas Winston.

143
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,483
-Yeah. What are you gonna do?
-Let's take it outside.

144
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,363
Why don't you both take it outside?

145
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,782
He's probably jumped a few people.

146
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,370
Anyway, you think the Socs have it made.

147
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,165
The rich kids. The Southside Soc.

148
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,087
I'll tell you something
that might be a surprise...

149
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,464
...but things are rough all over.

150
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:47,762
Let's get out of here, or Two-Bit
will think we eloped to Mexico.

151
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,392
So, you're from the Southside, huh?

152
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,270
-It must be a nice neighborhood.
-It is.

153
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,479
I like it.

154
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,483
I'm from the other side of town.

155
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:26,259
Tell me about your oldest brother.
You never talk about him.

156
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,094
What's to tell?

157
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:31,473
He's big and roofs houses.

158
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,767
No, really. What's he like?

159
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:36,061
I feel like I already know Sodapop.

160
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:39,773
Tell me about Darry.
Is he wild and reckless like Soda...

161
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:41,483
...or dreamy like you?

162
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,279
He ain't like Soda and he
sure ain't like me.

163
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:47,989
He can't stand me.

164
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:53,995
I bet he'd like to put me in a boy's
home, except Soda won't let him.

165
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:57,082
-What are you talking about?
-You all get along fine.

166
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:58,291
No, we don't.

167
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,960
Shut up 'cause you ain't wanted
at home neither.

168
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:02,462
You shut your mouth!

169
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,676
-I'm sorry, I just got a little mad.
-That's all right. Don't worry about it.

170
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,182
Oh, no, look who's coming!
What are we gonna do?

171
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,769
Who are these clowns?

172
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,272
Cherry, what's going on?

173
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,982
What are you doing?

174
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,195
Just because we got a little drunk--

175
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:30,198
You call reeling and passing out
on the streets "a little"?

176
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:34,494
I've told you before, I'm never going
out with you when you're drinking!

177
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,372
That's no reason to be with these bums.

178
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,082
Who're you calling bums, pal?

179
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,083
You!

180
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,377
We got two more of us in the back seat.

181
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,380
Pity the back seat!

182
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:48,174
-You're looking for a fight!
-I am looking for a fight!

183
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,179
We'll go with you.

184
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:57,183
-Why? We ain't scared of these bastards.
-I hate fights.

185
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,066
I'm sorry.

186
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,695
I couldn't use this.
I could never cut no one.

187
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,196
Cherry! Come on.

188
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,198
We'd better go with them.

189
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:21,875
If I see you in school and I don't say hi,
please don't take it personal.

190
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,293
Yeah, I know.

191
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,879
You're a nice boy....

192
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,089
It's okay.

193
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,266
I hope I never see Dallas Winston again.
If I do, I'll probably fall in love with him.

194
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,061
-Come on, baby.
-Don't touch me.

195
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,781
Just watch it, greaseball.

196
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:00,497
Those are two of the best-looking girls
I've ever seen.

197
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,674
-What was that?
-Marcia's number.

198
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:14,260
Probably fake, too.
I must have been crazy to ask her.

199
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:18,598
Girl like that would never go out with me.
Where you going?

200
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,058
Home.

201
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:23,269
I've got a new hat.

202
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:27,982
You're crazy!

203
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:31,695
You never would have used
that busted bottle I gave you.

204
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:33,863
I might have. Where you headed?

205
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,991
I don't know. Maybe I'll go play snooker
or get drunk.

206
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:38,660
-I'll see you later!
-Okay.

207
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,790
I hate when my folks are fighting.
Let's go to the lot.

208
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,971
It was because we're Greasers.

209
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:03,893
Might have hurt her reputation
or something. Don't worry about it.

210
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:06,980
I guess so.

211
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,076
That was a tough car.

212
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,498
Mustangs, they're tough.

213
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:29,085
Big-time Socs all right.

214
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:31,963
It's always the same.

215
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:50,565
I can't take much more of this.

216
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:54,069
I'll kill myself or something.

217
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,280
Don't talk like that, Johnny.

218
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,783
You can't kill yourself.

219
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:04,079
I've got to do something.

220
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:19,886
It seems like there's gotta be some place
without Greasers, Socs....

221
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:24,599
There must be some place...

222
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,563
...with just plain ordinary people.

223
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,986
It's like that out in the country...

224
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:41,366
...away from all the big towns.

225
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,079
In the country.

226
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,087
{y:i}I miss going there with my folks.

227
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:15,984
Ponny, wake up.

228
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,363
What time is it?

229
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:22,365
I don't know. I went to sleep, too.

230
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:26,995
You better go home.

231
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:30,790
I'm gonna stay all night out here.
Who'll care anyway?

232
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,377
If you get cold, come to my house.

233
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:38,173
What's Darry gonna say?

234
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:01,696
Where have you been?

235
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,365
Do you know what time it is?

236
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:05,367
It's 2:00 in the morning.

237
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:06,868
Where have you been?

238
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,370
Fell asleep in the lot.

239
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:13,166
I was talking to Johnny, then fell asleep.
I didn't mean to.

240
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:18,463
I can't even call the cops because
you two would be sent to a boy's home.

241
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:22,967
-Let's go to bed now.
-I said I didn't mean to.

242
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:26,596
"l didn't mean to, I forgot."
That's all I ever hear from you.

243
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:29,265
You shut up! I'm tired
of you sticking up for him!

244
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:30,892
Don't you yell at him.

245
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:33,770
Ponyboy...

246
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:35,188
...I didn't mean to.

247
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,372
Come on, Johnny. Let's run away.

248
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:09,389
Take it easy. It will be all right.
Just relax a minute.

249
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:11,474
Got a cigarette? I'm scared, man.

250
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:14,894
Don't be, man. You're scaring me.

251
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:16,771
What happened?

252
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:18,189
Darry hit me.

253
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:22,360
We got along fine until Mom and Dad died.
Now he can't stand me.

254
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:26,197
I think I like it better
when the old man's hitting me.

255
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:28,074
At least he knows I'm there.

256
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:33,997
Let's walk to the park.
Maybe I'll cool off enough to go home.

257
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,960
Ain't you about to freeze to death?

258
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:41,379
You're not kidding.

259
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,083
Got a light?

260
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:21,378
Found this butt, man.

261
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,671
Here.

262
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,384
Look what's coming.

263
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:30,178
This is our territory.

264
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,472
I bet they're looking for us.

265
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:37,394
Want to split?

266
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:38,561
Stay cool.

267
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:44,359
What do you know?

268
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:45,985
They're drunk.

269
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:51,199
It's that guy with the rings!

270
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:52,992
Aren't these the Greasers who...

271
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:56,496
...tried to pick up our women?

272
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,665
You're out of your territory.

273
00:24:58,665 --> 00:24:59,791
Better watch it!

274
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:01,459
No, you better watch it!

275
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:17,892
You guys know what Greasers are?
White trash with long, greasy hair.

276
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:29,487
You know what a Soc is?

277
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:30,488
What?

278
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,782
White trash with Mustangs and madras.

279
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:34,367
Get him!

280
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:37,662
Johnny, run!

281
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:46,588
Stay down, pal!

282
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,395
Son of a bitch! Grab his arms!

283
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:09,694
Give me a drink for this Greaser.

284
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:11,196
Here, give me that.

285
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:13,365
Have a drink, pal.

286
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:13,299
I killed him.

287
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:19,264
I killed that boy.

288
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:22,892
I killed him.

289
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:34,696
I think I'm gonna be sick.

290
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:39,993
Go ahead, man. I won't look at you.

291
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:42,495
I won't look.

292
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:54,090
Are you all right?

293
00:27:58,887 --> 00:28:00,680
You really did kill him?

294
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,773
I had to.

295
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:14,778
They were drowning you.
They might have killed you.

296
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:21,076
They were gonna beat me up.

297
00:28:22,577 --> 00:28:24,287
What happened to the other guys?

298
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:32,170
They all ran. They all ran off
when I stabbed him.

299
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:08,164
What do you boys want?

300
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,458
We gotta see Dallas.

301
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:13,169
He's busy.

302
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:16,089
Tell him it's Ponyboy and Johnny, man.
He'll come.

303
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:19,676
Come on.

304
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:39,863
What do you guys want?

305
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:42,574
-Johnny killed a Soc.
-What?

306
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:46,369
All right, good for you. Let's go.

307
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:49,664
We thought you could get us out,
if anyone could.

308
00:29:51,082 --> 00:29:54,669
I'm sorry to get you away from this party,
but I don't know what to do.

309
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:59,466
I was just trying to get some sleep.
I got in a fight with Shepard tonight.

310
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:01,468
Let me see what we can do. Get in.

311
00:30:02,677 --> 00:30:04,679
-Are you wet?
-I'm okay.

312
00:30:12,187 --> 00:30:15,273
You'll die of pneumonia
before the cops ever get you.

313
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:26,076
Hey, stupid, take your sweatshirt off.
You'll freeze to death.

314
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:31,081
I wish I had a weed now.

315
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:39,589
Don't point the thing at me. It's loaded.

316
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:48,682
Here's $50.

317
00:30:49,182 --> 00:30:52,686
I'm not anxious to tell your brother
and get my head kicked in.

318
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:54,062
Then don't.

319
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:58,066
This is a little big, but it's dry.

320
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:06,199
Take the 3:15 train to Windrixville.
It's a freight.

321
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:10,495
There's an abandoned church
on top of Jay Mountain.

322
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:15,291
There's a pump in the back,
so you don't have to worry about water.

323
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:23,383
Get a week's supply of food as soon
as you get there, before the story gets out.

324
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:31,766
Then don't so much as stick your noses
out the door. Am I clear?

325
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:35,478
I'll be there when everything is cool.

326
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:38,690
Relax. lt'll work out.

327
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,575
I thought New York was the only place
I'd end up in a murder wrap.

328
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:49,993
Jesus Christ!

329
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:22,567
-Let's check the other car.
-Yeah.

330
00:33:00,271 --> 00:33:01,773
Check it out, man.

331
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:03,983
The church.

332
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:26,965
-What was that?
-Just an owl.

333
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:53,658
Johnny?

334
00:33:57,287 --> 00:33:58,580
You all right?

335
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:11,384
This floor sure is hard.

336
00:34:30,195 --> 00:34:32,280
{y:i}School day, rise and shine.

337
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:33,573
{y:i}Come on.

338
00:34:33,865 --> 00:34:35,158
{y:i}Time to get up.

339
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:38,161
Johnny?

340
00:34:49,964 --> 00:34:51,383
A loaf of bread...

341
00:34:52,175 --> 00:34:54,260
...and a week's supply of baloney.

342
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:57,472
Peanut butter.

343
00:34:58,682 --> 00:34:59,974
{y:i}"Gone With The Wind."

344
00:35:00,975 --> 00:35:03,395
How did you know I always wanted it?

345
00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:06,981
I remember you said something once.
We saw the movie, remember?

346
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:09,567
Maybe you can read it out loud to kill time.

347
00:35:11,194 --> 00:35:12,487
Thanks a lot.

348
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:17,367
-Cigarettes.
-A deck of cards.

349
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:22,497
Peroxide?

350
00:35:28,586 --> 00:35:31,965
-You ain't thinking--
-We'll cut our hair, you'll bleach yours.

351
00:35:31,965 --> 00:35:34,676
Our descriptions will be in the newspaper.

352
00:35:35,468 --> 00:35:37,178
You ain't gonna touch my hair.

353
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:41,391
You'd have to, anyway, if we got caught.
The judge would make you get a haircut.

354
00:35:41,683 --> 00:35:43,685
-I don't see why.
-I don't know either.

355
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:46,062
It's just the way they try to break us.

356
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:49,065
I'm gonna cut mine, too,
and wash the grease out.

357
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:52,485
-You ain't touching my hair.
-It will grow back.

358
00:35:52,861 --> 00:35:54,779
It's not that it won't.

359
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:57,282
Go ahead.

360
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:08,960
Sorry.

361
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:19,095
Damn knife.

362
00:36:20,388 --> 00:36:21,598
Don't pull so hard.

363
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:23,266
Quit gabbing.

364
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,895
Sorry, man.

365
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:28,563
Can I see now?

366
00:36:28,688 --> 00:36:30,690
No, we gotta bleach it first.

367
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,692
Bleach it and quit cutting.

368
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,279
This will do it.

369
00:36:39,699 --> 00:36:40,658
Here.

370
00:36:44,287 --> 00:36:46,373
Jeez, this really makes me look tough.

371
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:54,881
Go ahead. Get your jollies.

372
00:36:54,964 --> 00:36:56,966
-My pleasure.
-Yeah, I know it is.

373
00:37:02,681 --> 00:37:03,973
Be nice.

374
00:37:08,186 --> 00:37:10,271
-It hurts, don't it?
-Yeah, yeah.

375
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,691
I didn't cut that much off of you.

376
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:14,693
It was your idea, smarty.

377
00:37:22,784 --> 00:37:25,161
Well, I guess we're disguised.

378
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:29,582
I guess so.

379
00:37:36,297 --> 00:37:37,799
It's just hair.

380
00:37:38,758 --> 00:37:42,971
It ain't us. It's like being in a costume
you can't get out of and I hate it.

381
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:45,265
Well, we gotta get used to it, Ponyboy.

382
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:48,393
We're in big trouble. It's our looks or us.

383
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:57,068
{y:i}"The next four or five days were
{y:i}the longest I've ever spent in my life."

384
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:15,295
-Johnny, are you awake?
-Yeah.

385
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:20,091
There's a monster outside.

386
00:38:21,468 --> 00:38:22,469
What?

387
00:38:24,971 --> 00:38:26,973
We're gonna be okay.

388
00:38:34,898 --> 00:38:38,276
"Lying in the pit of the sun,
shoulder to shoulder, head to feet...

389
00:38:38,276 --> 00:38:41,780
"...were hundreds of wounded men
lying in the tracks, the sidewalks...

390
00:38:41,863 --> 00:38:45,158
"...stretched out in endless rows,
under the car shed.

391
00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:50,789
"Some lay stiff and still,
but many withered in the hot sun.

392
00:38:52,999 --> 00:38:55,585
"Everywhere swarms of flies
hovered over the men...

393
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:57,796
"...crawling and buzzing in their faces."

394
00:38:57,879 --> 00:38:58,963
That's gross.

395
00:38:59,297 --> 00:39:02,467
"Everywhere was blood,
dirty bandages, groans...

396
00:39:02,592 --> 00:39:04,594
"...screamed curses of pain."

397
00:39:14,187 --> 00:39:15,480
Get him!

398
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:20,777
Come back here!

399
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:48,972
Watch your smoke, Johnny.

400
00:39:57,272 --> 00:39:59,566
{y:i}"One morning I woke up earlier than usual.

401
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:02,360
{y:i}"The church was colder than ever."

402
00:40:15,373 --> 00:40:17,375
That was sure pretty.

403
00:40:18,376 --> 00:40:19,461
Yeah.

404
00:40:21,463 --> 00:40:25,091
The mist is what's pretty,
all gold and silver.

405
00:40:28,887 --> 00:40:31,598
Too bad it can't stay like that all the time.

406
00:40:33,558 --> 00:40:35,268
{y:i}Nothing Gold Can Stay.

407
00:40:38,063 --> 00:40:40,065
"Nature's first green is gold,

408
00:40:40,982 --> 00:40:42,567
"Her hardest hue to hold.

409
00:40:45,695 --> 00:40:47,697
"Her early leaf's a flower;

410
00:40:49,783 --> 00:40:51,785
"But only so an hour.

411
00:40:53,661 --> 00:40:55,580
"Then leaf subsides to leaf.

412
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,292
"So Eden sank to grief,

413
00:41:01,878 --> 00:41:03,672
"So dawn goes down to day.

414
00:41:05,965 --> 00:41:08,259
"Nothing gold can stay."

415
00:41:11,262 --> 00:41:13,973
Where did you learn that?
That's what I meant.

416
00:41:15,684 --> 00:41:17,268
Robert Frost wrote it.

417
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:21,564
I always remembered it 'cause
I never quite knew what he meant by it.

418
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:28,863
I never noticed colors, clouds and stuff
until you kept reminding me about them.

419
00:41:30,281 --> 00:41:32,367
It's like they were never there before.

420
00:41:35,495 --> 00:41:38,289
I don't think I could ever tell Steve
or Two-Bit...

421
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:40,959
...or Darry about the clouds and sunset.

422
00:41:42,877 --> 00:41:44,170
Just you and Sodapop.

423
00:41:46,172 --> 00:41:47,674
Maybe Cherry Valance.

424
00:41:48,299 --> 00:41:49,884
I guess we're different.

425
00:41:51,761 --> 00:41:54,389
-Maybe they are.
-Maybe you're right.

426
00:42:44,064 --> 00:42:45,482
Hey, blondie.

427
00:42:46,775 --> 00:42:47,776
Wake up.

428
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:51,696
-How have you been?
-Johnny, rise and shine, man.

429
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,365
How's Soda doing?

430
00:42:54,282 --> 00:42:56,159
-Is he upset?
-Are the fuzz after us?

431
00:42:56,284 --> 00:42:59,287
Wait. One thing at a time.
Are you guys hungry?

432
00:42:59,496 --> 00:43:02,791
-I'm starving.
-You are? Try baloney for four days.

433
00:43:04,292 --> 00:43:05,877
Got a cancer stick?

434
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:14,678
I got a special delivery for Ponyboy Curtis.

435
00:43:16,388 --> 00:43:17,764
Who's this from?

436
00:43:18,598 --> 00:43:20,892
The President of the United States.

437
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:22,977
-Yeah, right.
-Seriously.

438
00:43:23,687 --> 00:43:25,563
From your brother, Sodapop.

439
00:43:26,064 --> 00:43:28,191
How did he know I was here?

440
00:43:29,567 --> 00:43:32,696
I said I didn't know where you were,
but he didn't believe me.

441
00:43:32,696 --> 00:43:34,572
He really wanted you to get it.

442
00:43:35,198 --> 00:43:37,659
{y:i}"I guess you got into some trouble.

443
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:39,494
{y:i}"Darry's sorry he hit you.

444
00:43:39,786 --> 00:43:41,788
{y:i}"You know he didn't mean it.

445
00:43:41,871 --> 00:43:45,667
{y:i}"It scared us when Dallas was taken
{y:i}into the police station.

446
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:48,461
{y:i}"I wish you'd come back
{y:i}and turn yourselves in.

447
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:50,088
{y:i}"We miss you.

448
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:53,383
{y:i}"Say hi to Johnny for us. Sodapop Curtis."

449
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:59,597
What's going on with the cops?
Did you hear anything?

450
00:43:59,597 --> 00:44:01,182
How come you got hauled in?

451
00:44:01,182 --> 00:44:03,685
Those boys at the station
know me by now.

452
00:44:05,895 --> 00:44:08,565
While I was there,
they beat it out of me that...

453
00:44:10,275 --> 00:44:12,569
...you guys were headed for Texas.

454
00:44:12,694 --> 00:44:14,279
They think you're in Texas.

455
00:44:15,572 --> 00:44:17,073
Texas! God!

456
00:44:19,868 --> 00:44:23,371
Look at this guy with his hair.
I can't believe that.

457
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:27,792
Blondie.

458
00:44:27,959 --> 00:44:30,670
I know I look lousy, but don't rub it in.

459
00:44:33,465 --> 00:44:37,177
-Want to get something to eat?
-Yeah. Let's get out of here.

460
00:44:39,262 --> 00:44:41,181
Where did you get this car?

461
00:44:41,681 --> 00:44:42,974
It's Buck's.

462
00:44:46,686 --> 00:44:48,480
-What are you doing?
-Don't, Dal!

463
00:44:48,563 --> 00:44:49,564
Watch it!

464
00:44:49,981 --> 00:44:52,275
I hope you're in the mood for Bar-B-Que.

465
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:54,694
-Jerk!
-Are you trying to kill us?

466
00:44:54,694 --> 00:44:58,490
Three Bar-B-Que sandwiches
and three Cokes.

467
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,582
You guys really are hungry.

468
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:11,378
That kid you killed had plenty of friends.

469
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:13,963
It's all over town, "Soc against Grease."

470
00:45:14,964 --> 00:45:18,677
-Look, I started carrying a heater.
-You kill people with heaters.

471
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:21,471
Don't worry, it ain't loaded.

472
00:45:22,764 --> 00:45:25,975
-Do you have 15 cents?
-I don't have any money.

473
00:45:26,976 --> 00:45:30,397
-Do you have a dime?
-Go away. We're busy here.

474
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:33,858
Go away! Get out of here!

475
00:45:36,778 --> 00:45:38,363
That was a close call.

476
00:45:42,367 --> 00:45:46,371
Tim Shepard's gang and our gang are going
to fight the Socs tomorrow night.

477
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:50,667
I didn't tell you we got a spy.

478
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:51,668
Who?

479
00:45:51,793 --> 00:45:56,673
Remember that good-looking broad I tried
to pick up the night you wasted that kid?

480
00:45:56,798 --> 00:45:58,174
What's her name?

481
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:01,261
Cherry something? The redhead?

482
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:04,597
-Cherry Valance.
-Cherry the Soc. Yeah.

483
00:46:05,473 --> 00:46:08,685
We were at the vacant lot and she pulls up.

484
00:46:09,686 --> 00:46:11,479
I thought that took a lot of nerve.

485
00:46:11,563 --> 00:46:12,689
Yeah.

486
00:46:12,981 --> 00:46:14,399
She said she'd...

487
00:46:14,399 --> 00:46:19,279
...testify that the Socs were drunk
and they were looking for the fight.

488
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:22,282
And you just fought back
strictly on self-defense.

489
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:23,783
So, it's cool.

490
00:46:25,493 --> 00:46:27,787
That little broad sure does hate me.

491
00:46:28,163 --> 00:46:31,958
I offered to take her for a Coke,
and she told me to go to hell.

492
00:46:36,171 --> 00:46:38,590
So you think she might like me a little bit?

493
00:46:40,091 --> 00:46:42,093
I think she's kind of cute.

494
00:46:44,971 --> 00:46:48,099
What do they do for kicks around here?
Play checkers?

495
00:46:48,266 --> 00:46:49,768
This place is out of it.

496
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:58,485
-I've never been to the country before.
-We're gonna turn ourselves in.

497
00:47:01,071 --> 00:47:03,073
I got a good chance of being let off easy.

498
00:47:03,198 --> 00:47:06,493
It was self-defense, like you said.
Pony and Cherry could testify.

499
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:07,994
We won't say you helped us.

500
00:47:08,078 --> 00:47:11,289
I'll give you back that gun,
so you won't get into any trouble.

501
00:47:11,373 --> 00:47:13,291
Are you sure this is what you want?

502
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:16,670
It ain't fair for Darry and Soda
to worry about Ponyboy.

503
00:47:19,172 --> 00:47:22,175
-I guess my folks aren't worrying.
-The boys are worried.

504
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:25,178
Two-Bit wanted to go to Texas
to hunt for you.

505
00:47:25,595 --> 00:47:28,890
-I asked if my parents asked about me?
-No, they didn't.

506
00:47:28,973 --> 00:47:31,685
Do you think my old man gives a damn...

507
00:47:31,768 --> 00:47:34,771
...if I'm dead in a car wreck
or in jail or something?

508
00:47:34,771 --> 00:47:37,774
He doesn't care.
But that doesn't bother me none.

509
00:47:41,277 --> 00:47:43,697
Come on. You're not going anywhere.

510
00:47:48,993 --> 00:47:52,664
I get you a hideout, I get you a hangout,
a hideout.

511
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:58,461
And now you want to split. This is terrific.

512
00:47:59,879 --> 00:48:03,091
You don't know what a few months in jail
can do to you.

513
00:48:03,383 --> 00:48:07,387
You get mean. I just don't want to see it
happen to you like it did to me.

514
00:48:15,186 --> 00:48:17,981
-What's going on?
-I wonder how that started?

515
00:48:30,368 --> 00:48:31,995
Where are you going?

516
00:48:32,162 --> 00:48:33,163
Get over here!

517
00:48:34,873 --> 00:48:36,583
Some of the children are missing.

518
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:39,669
I'm sure of it.

519
00:48:43,673 --> 00:48:44,966
Get ahold of yourself.

520
00:48:45,884 --> 00:48:46,676
Come back.

521
00:48:46,885 --> 00:48:48,678
Don't go in there, you'll get hurt.

522
00:48:49,888 --> 00:48:51,181
Come here, man.

523
00:48:53,975 --> 00:48:55,560
You're gonna get him?

524
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:01,983
Move back before you get hurt.

525
00:49:19,376 --> 00:49:20,794
What was that?

526
00:49:21,586 --> 00:49:23,588
-ls that guy coming?
-No.

527
00:49:24,172 --> 00:49:26,966
-How come? Too scared?
-No. Too fat.

528
00:49:32,681 --> 00:49:33,890
Johnny, watch out!

529
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:35,684
We'll get you out of here.

530
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:51,991
Help me! Over here!

531
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:54,577
Move it! Get out!

532
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:56,579
Look, man!

533
00:49:56,663 --> 00:49:57,664
In here.

534
00:50:03,294 --> 00:50:05,463
Hey, Dal, take this kid.

535
00:50:06,798 --> 00:50:08,591
Get out of here, Johnny.

536
00:50:09,092 --> 00:50:10,260
Are you okay?

537
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,265
Take them to Dallas.

538
00:50:16,266 --> 00:50:17,767
Get them and get out!

539
00:50:25,692 --> 00:50:26,484
Come on!

540
00:50:26,568 --> 00:50:27,861
Are you crazy?

541
00:50:29,571 --> 00:50:30,864
You're burning!

542
00:50:30,989 --> 00:50:32,198
Get him!

543
00:50:41,666 --> 00:50:43,960
Jesus Christ! Stupid kid.

544
00:50:47,172 --> 00:50:48,173
Help!

545
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:49,883
I'm coming, Johnny!

546
00:51:01,394 --> 00:51:02,771
Johnny? Dallas?

547
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,982
They're all right. They're behind us.

548
00:51:06,691 --> 00:51:08,276
They're in another ambulance.

549
00:51:08,693 --> 00:51:12,280
You three are the bravest kids
I've seen in a long time.

550
00:51:13,573 --> 00:51:16,076
Are you professional heroes or something?

551
00:51:16,868 --> 00:51:18,286
We're Greasers.

552
00:51:19,162 --> 00:51:21,373
-Are you kidding me?
-No, I'm not.

553
00:51:22,874 --> 00:51:25,585
Take me to town and you'll find out fast.

554
00:51:32,967 --> 00:51:34,678
You shouldn't smoke, son.

555
00:51:35,887 --> 00:51:37,097
Why not?

556
00:51:38,098 --> 00:51:40,266
Because you're a young man, that's why.

557
00:51:40,684 --> 00:51:42,394
It's a bad habit to get into.

558
00:51:43,269 --> 00:51:44,562
You're smoking.

559
00:51:44,896 --> 00:51:47,565
I'm older than you.
I've been smoking for a long time.

560
00:51:56,783 --> 00:51:59,577
If you ever pull another stunt like that,
I'll kill you.

561
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:17,262
Look at your tough hair.

562
00:52:20,473 --> 00:52:21,599
I'm sorry.

563
00:52:23,768 --> 00:52:26,771
I thought we lost you
like we did Mom and Dad.

564
00:52:35,488 --> 00:52:37,073
You sure look funny.

565
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:49,461
Let's go, little brother.

566
00:52:50,587 --> 00:52:51,796
We're home.

567
00:52:53,882 --> 00:52:56,259
He's getting pretty big to be carried.

568
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:31,169
-Anybody home?
-ln here. Don't slam the door.

569
00:53:39,969 --> 00:53:42,472
What are you doing? Look what you did.

570
00:53:42,597 --> 00:53:44,891
You made me ruin my eggs
and drop my spoon.

571
00:53:44,891 --> 00:53:46,976
Look at the blond-headed monkey!

572
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:50,271
I wouldn't have believed it,
if I hadn't seen it in the paper.

573
00:53:50,897 --> 00:53:53,858
Tell me, Ponyboy,
what's it like being a hero?

574
00:53:54,067 --> 00:53:55,068
A what?

575
00:53:55,193 --> 00:53:57,487
A hero, you know, like a big shot.

576
00:53:58,196 --> 00:53:59,698
Beer for breakfast, Two-Bit?

577
00:54:02,992 --> 00:54:05,161
They're charging Johnny
with manslaughter?

578
00:54:06,579 --> 00:54:08,498
What do they mean, "if he recovers"?

579
00:54:08,498 --> 00:54:10,583
It also says how you saved them kids.

580
00:54:10,667 --> 00:54:13,670
They'd have burned to death
if it hadn't been for you.

581
00:54:13,795 --> 00:54:17,090
Dallas will be mad.
They didn't mention his police record.

582
00:54:18,591 --> 00:54:19,968
It's all about us.

583
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:23,680
Darry, me and Soda.

584
00:54:25,974 --> 00:54:28,768
They're thinking about putting me
and Soda in a boy's home?

585
00:54:28,893 --> 00:54:30,061
No way.

586
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:32,397
They ain't putting me in a boy's home!

587
00:54:32,397 --> 00:54:34,482
They don't do that to heroes.

588
00:54:35,066 --> 00:54:37,277
Where is Soda and Super-Dope, anyhow?

589
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:43,867
Super...what?

590
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:45,577
All brawn, no brains.

591
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,579
Have you seen my shirt somewhere?

592
00:54:47,662 --> 00:54:50,665
You have to wear pants too.
I think there is a law.

593
00:54:50,665 --> 00:54:54,294
-How about my jeans?
-I ironed them. They're in my closet.

594
00:54:55,462 --> 00:54:57,088
Hurry up, you'll be late.

595
00:54:57,464 --> 00:55:00,592
Did you hear about
that juvenile court thing?

596
00:55:03,261 --> 00:55:05,263
The cops told me last night.

597
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:10,977
After we stomp the Socs real good,
we'll throw a party so we can get drunk.

598
00:55:12,395 --> 00:55:16,066
-Where you gonna get the dough?
-I'll think of something.

599
00:55:19,569 --> 00:55:20,987
Mickey's on TV.

600
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:39,589
I hate to leave you by yourself.
I should take the day off.

601
00:55:39,673 --> 00:55:43,677
I'll be okay. I've stayed by myself before.
Besides, we can't afford it.

602
00:55:44,678 --> 00:55:47,972
-Yes, but I should stay.
-Don't worry, I'll babysit him.

603
00:55:48,973 --> 00:55:51,184
Why don't you get a job?

604
00:55:52,185 --> 00:55:54,270
Come on, Soda. We gotta get to work.

605
00:55:55,397 --> 00:55:58,692
I've gotta quit smoking,
or I can't do track next year.

606
00:55:59,067 --> 00:56:00,485
You gotta do the dishes.

607
00:56:00,568 --> 00:56:03,363
-I'm gonna cut off your air.
-Two-Bit, lay off.

608
00:56:04,698 --> 00:56:06,282
He ain't looking so good.

609
00:56:06,991 --> 00:56:07,992
Lazy bum!

610
00:56:13,581 --> 00:56:16,167
You smoke more than a pack today...

611
00:56:17,168 --> 00:56:19,462
...and I'll skin you, you understand?

612
00:56:20,964 --> 00:56:23,883
If you carry more than one bundle
of roofing at a time...

613
00:56:23,967 --> 00:56:26,594
...me and Soda will skin you. Understand?

614
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,182
-Say hi to Johnny.
-All right.

615
00:56:40,692 --> 00:56:42,485
We gotta clean up the house.

616
00:56:42,569 --> 00:56:44,571
The cops and reporters will come by...

617
00:56:44,696 --> 00:56:47,866
...and it's time for the state people
to check on us.

618
00:56:48,366 --> 00:56:51,369
This house ain't messy.
You ought to see my house.

619
00:56:52,162 --> 00:56:54,581
I have. If you had the sense
of a billy goat...

620
00:56:54,664 --> 00:56:57,584
...you'd clean up your house
instead of bumming around ours.

621
00:56:58,585 --> 00:57:01,171
If I ever did that,
my mom would die of shock.

622
00:57:17,479 --> 00:57:19,981
I'd drive, but the brakes went out
on my car.

623
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:21,858
Almost killed me and Kathy.

624
00:57:23,985 --> 00:57:26,488
You should meet her brother.
Now, there's a hood.

625
00:57:26,571 --> 00:57:28,990
He's so greasy, he glides when he walks.

626
00:57:30,867 --> 00:57:34,579
He goes to the barber shop
for an oil change, not a haircut.

627
00:57:45,465 --> 00:57:47,092
-Stay close.
-What do they want?

628
00:57:47,175 --> 00:57:50,595
-I don't know. How many were in the car?
-Four or five.

629
00:57:50,887 --> 00:57:52,180
Let's hurry inside.

630
00:57:55,183 --> 00:57:56,893
Let's see what they want.

631
00:57:57,477 --> 00:58:00,397
-Why do you want to see what they want?
-Just stay here.

632
00:58:10,073 --> 00:58:12,659
No jabs before the rumble.
You know the rules, ape-face.

633
00:58:12,784 --> 00:58:13,868
We know.

634
00:58:14,661 --> 00:58:15,995
I want to talk to you.

635
00:58:18,665 --> 00:58:20,959
Go ahead. I'll keep my eye on him.

636
00:58:23,586 --> 00:58:25,296
Speaking of the rumble, pal....

637
00:58:29,092 --> 00:58:31,761
I read about you in the paper. How come?

638
00:58:32,971 --> 00:58:34,389
I don't know.

639
00:58:34,889 --> 00:58:36,599
I felt like playing the hero.

640
00:58:36,683 --> 00:58:38,560
-I wouldn't have.
-Wouldn't have what?

641
00:58:39,769 --> 00:58:41,980
I would have let those kids burn to death.

642
00:58:42,272 --> 00:58:45,191
You might not have.
You might have done the same.

643
00:58:45,567 --> 00:58:46,860
I don't know.

644
00:58:48,194 --> 00:58:50,196
I just don't know anything anymore.

645
00:58:52,073 --> 00:58:56,369
-I never believed a Greaser could do that.
-Greaser has nothing to do with it.

646
00:58:58,079 --> 00:58:59,998
Check out their pants!

647
00:59:01,374 --> 00:59:02,792
Want to talk inside?

648
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:05,962
Are you boys waiting for a flood?

649
00:59:08,465 --> 00:59:11,760
I hear they stamp your face
into gorilla cookies.

650
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:15,889
-You're funny.
-Oh, yeah?

651
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:20,894
I couldn't tell this to anyone else.
My friends would think I'm crazy.

652
00:59:24,064 --> 00:59:27,067
That friend of yours who got burned.
He might die.

653
00:59:31,071 --> 00:59:34,491
And tonight, people will get hurt
at the rumble. Maybe killed.

654
00:59:39,788 --> 00:59:41,873
You can't win. You know that.

655
00:59:42,999 --> 00:59:46,294
Even if you whip us,
you'll still be at the bottom.

656
00:59:47,087 --> 00:59:50,799
We'll still be the lucky ones at the top
with all the breaks.

657
00:59:53,093 --> 00:59:56,596
Greasers will still be Greasers,
and Socs will still be Socs.

658
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,972
It doesn't matter.

659
01:00:02,185 --> 01:00:03,687
Anyway, thanks, Greaser.

660
01:00:07,065 --> 01:00:08,775
I meant, thanks, kid.

661
01:00:11,486 --> 01:00:14,989
Been nice talking to you, Randy.
My name's Ponyboy.

662
01:00:24,165 --> 01:00:26,459
You're real funny, Two-Bit. Let's go.

663
01:00:28,962 --> 01:00:31,673
-Now, get the hell out of here.
-See you at the rumble.

664
01:00:36,261 --> 01:00:38,763
What did "Mr. Super-Soc" have to say?

665
01:00:39,472 --> 01:00:40,890
He ain't a Soc.

666
01:00:41,766 --> 01:00:43,768
Just a guy that wanted to talk.

667
01:00:47,772 --> 01:00:49,691
-Take care.
-See you later.

668
01:00:49,899 --> 01:00:50,984
Take it easy.

669
01:01:05,665 --> 01:01:07,459
How they treating you, kid?

670
01:01:13,381 --> 01:01:16,760
You got your picture in the paper
for being a hero.

671
01:01:16,968 --> 01:01:18,470
Look at that.

672
01:01:19,763 --> 01:01:21,598
That's tough enough, huh?

673
01:01:23,767 --> 01:01:25,894
I guess you can look at it later.

674
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:30,690
Do you want anything?

675
01:01:31,399 --> 01:01:32,776
A book.

676
01:01:34,361 --> 01:01:36,071
Can you get me another one?

677
01:01:36,988 --> 01:01:39,991
He wants {y:i}Gone With The Wind,
so I can read it to him.

678
01:01:41,576 --> 01:01:43,661
Would you mind getting it?

679
01:01:45,872 --> 01:01:48,166
I'll go get it from the gift shop downstairs.

680
01:02:06,685 --> 01:02:08,687
I guess Dal's gonna be okay.

681
01:02:11,189 --> 01:02:13,775
Me and Darry, we're getting along
real good now.

682
01:02:15,694 --> 01:02:16,986
Are you okay?

683
01:02:19,698 --> 01:02:21,574
It just hurts sometimes.

684
01:02:23,576 --> 01:02:28,289
Not usually, because I can't feel anything
below the middle of my back.

685
01:02:28,998 --> 01:02:30,959
Pretty bad off, ain't l?

686
01:02:31,876 --> 01:02:33,962
No. You'll be all right, kid.

687
01:02:35,964 --> 01:02:37,590
You gotta be.

688
01:02:38,758 --> 01:02:40,593
We couldn't get along without you.

689
01:02:40,677 --> 01:02:43,096
I won't be able to walk again.

690
01:02:43,972 --> 01:02:47,058
Not even on crutches.
Doc says I busted my back.

691
01:02:48,059 --> 01:02:49,561
You're gonna be fine.

692
01:02:52,063 --> 01:02:53,481
I know you are.

693
01:02:54,566 --> 01:02:56,776
You want to know something, Ponyboy?

694
01:02:56,985 --> 01:03:00,989
I used to talk about killing myself
all the time. I don't want to die now.

695
01:03:01,865 --> 01:03:05,869
It ain't long enough.
Sixteen years ain't gonna be long enough.

696
01:03:07,579 --> 01:03:11,499
Hell, I wouldn't mind so much if there
wasn't so much stuff I ain't done yet...

697
01:03:12,167 --> 01:03:14,794
...so many damn things I ain't seen yet.

698
01:03:17,964 --> 01:03:20,175
That time we were up in Windrixville...

699
01:03:21,593 --> 01:03:24,888
...was the only time I've ever been away
from our neighborhood.

700
01:03:28,475 --> 01:03:29,893
Knock it off.

701
01:03:30,894 --> 01:03:34,272
If you get too juiced up,
the doc won't let us see you anymore.

702
01:03:40,487 --> 01:03:42,572
Your mother is here to see you.

703
01:03:42,697 --> 01:03:46,659
-I don't want to see her.
-It's your mother, she's here to see you.

704
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,870
I said I don't want to see her.

705
01:03:48,995 --> 01:03:52,165
She probably just wants to tell me
how much trouble I'm causing.

706
01:03:52,165 --> 01:03:54,167
Why don't you tell her to--

707
01:03:56,795 --> 01:03:58,088
What's the matter?

708
01:03:58,171 --> 01:04:00,799
-You just can't see him now.
-Pony, is he okay?

709
01:04:01,675 --> 01:04:03,760
-I don't know.
-He's all right.

710
01:04:04,177 --> 01:04:06,888
-You make sure he gets this, all right?
-Okay.

711
01:04:13,186 --> 01:04:16,189
-What's happened to your gown?
-I threw it away.

712
01:04:16,398 --> 01:04:18,983
Get out! You make my stomach sick.

713
01:04:22,195 --> 01:04:24,572
-How are you doing?
-How are you doing, man?

714
01:04:24,698 --> 01:04:26,366
Here, I swiped you a gift.

715
01:04:27,158 --> 01:04:30,662
It's good to see you guys.
This place gives me the creeps.

716
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:32,080
I want out.

717
01:04:34,165 --> 01:04:35,959
Tim Shepard dropped by.

718
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:38,670
He saw my picture.

719
01:04:38,795 --> 01:04:43,174
He couldn't believe it didn't have
"Wanted Dead or Alive" underneath it.

720
01:04:43,967 --> 01:04:45,969
He told me about the rumble.

721
01:04:47,470 --> 01:04:48,763
I hate missing it.

722
01:04:51,474 --> 01:04:52,976
You got a cigarette?

723
01:05:03,194 --> 01:05:05,196
How is he? How's Johnny doing, man?

724
01:05:07,699 --> 01:05:09,576
I don't know about stuff like this...

725
01:05:11,077 --> 01:05:13,079
...but he didn't look too good.

726
01:05:15,081 --> 01:05:17,083
He passed out cold before we left.

727
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:29,971
Still got that knife?

728
01:05:31,765 --> 01:05:32,974
That knife.

729
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:36,269
Give it to me, will you?

730
01:05:46,863 --> 01:05:48,865
We gotta win that fight tonight.

731
01:05:51,868 --> 01:05:53,870
We gotta get even with those Socs.

732
01:05:59,084 --> 01:06:02,295
Let's do it for Johnny.
We'll do it for Johnny!

733
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:12,972
Are you okay?

734
01:06:16,476 --> 01:06:17,977
You feel kind of hot.

735
01:06:18,895 --> 01:06:19,896
I'm okay.

736
01:06:21,398 --> 01:06:23,983
Be a pal and don't tell Darry, okay?

737
01:06:25,694 --> 01:06:28,363
I'll take a bunch of aspirins
when I get home.

738
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,281
All right.

739
01:06:30,782 --> 01:06:34,369
But Darry will kill me if he finds out
you're sick and you fight anyway.

740
01:06:35,578 --> 01:06:37,872
Keep your trap shut and he won't find out.

741
01:06:41,167 --> 01:06:45,171
Do you know that the only thing
that keeps Darry from being a Soc is us?

742
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:46,381
Yeah, I know.

743
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:54,597
{y:i}Tonight. I don't like it one bit.

744
01:06:57,058 --> 01:06:59,477
Something awful's gonna happen.

745
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:18,163
We're gonna stomp those Socs.
Everything's gonna be all right.

746
01:07:25,795 --> 01:07:29,174
-Tough little kids, huh?
-Yeah. Future Greasers.

747
01:07:40,894 --> 01:07:42,562
What's up with the big times?

748
01:07:44,481 --> 01:07:45,774
No weapons.

749
01:07:46,191 --> 01:07:48,360
They play your way. It's a fair deal.

750
01:07:48,693 --> 01:07:50,070
You sure about that?

751
01:07:50,862 --> 01:07:52,989
Randy told me. He knows for sure.

752
01:07:55,158 --> 01:07:56,868
Good deal. Thanks, Cherry.

753
01:07:59,662 --> 01:08:00,997
Ponyboy, wait a minute.

754
01:08:01,081 --> 01:08:03,083
Come here, I want to talk to you.

755
01:08:06,461 --> 01:08:07,879
How's Johnny doing?

756
01:08:08,171 --> 01:08:09,589
Not so good.

757
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:12,467
Would you come and see him?

758
01:08:12,676 --> 01:08:14,594
-No, I couldn't.
-Why not?

759
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:16,888
I couldn't.

760
01:08:20,558 --> 01:08:22,185
He killed Bob.

761
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:26,272
Maybe Bob asked for it.

762
01:08:26,981 --> 01:08:28,483
I know he did.

763
01:08:30,068 --> 01:08:33,697
But you didn't know his other side.
He could be real sweet.

764
01:08:36,199 --> 01:08:37,867
He wasn't just any boy.

765
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:41,287
Bob had something
that made him different...

766
01:08:42,163 --> 01:08:46,167
...made people follow him. A little better
than the crowd, you know what I mean?

767
01:08:47,293 --> 01:08:51,297
I don't want you to go see him anyway.
We don't need your damn charity!

768
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:58,471
I wasn't trying to give you charity.

769
01:09:02,475 --> 01:09:04,269
I only wanted to help.

770
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:07,772
I liked you from the start.

771
01:09:08,398 --> 01:09:09,983
The way we talked.

772
01:09:11,693 --> 01:09:14,070
Wouldn't you try to help me if you could?

773
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:19,784
Can you see the sunset
from the Southside very good?

774
01:09:20,493 --> 01:09:21,870
Yeah. Real good.

775
01:09:23,288 --> 01:09:25,582
You can see it from the Northside, too.

776
01:09:27,292 --> 01:09:28,960
Thanks, Ponyboy.

777
01:09:29,586 --> 01:09:30,795
You dig okay.

778
01:09:32,088 --> 01:09:33,381
See you around.

779
01:09:48,271 --> 01:09:51,483
-Soda, when did you start shaving?
-When I was 15.

780
01:09:54,694 --> 01:09:57,572
-When did Darry?
-When he was 13.

781
01:09:57,697 --> 01:10:00,367
Why? Growing a beard for the rumble?

782
01:10:01,159 --> 01:10:02,660
You're funny.

783
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:07,374
{y:i}Readers Digest pays a lot of money
for funny things.

784
01:10:11,086 --> 01:10:12,962
You like fights, huh, Soda?

785
01:10:12,962 --> 01:10:14,673
Yeah, I like fights.

786
01:10:16,091 --> 01:10:18,176
-How come?
-It's a contest.

787
01:10:18,259 --> 01:10:20,595
It's like a drag race,
or a dance or something.

788
01:10:20,679 --> 01:10:23,098
We'll beat those Socs' heads in.

789
01:10:23,181 --> 01:10:26,559
When I get into a fight, I want to stomp.
I like it, too.

790
01:10:29,979 --> 01:10:31,690
Why do you like fights?

791
01:10:31,773 --> 01:10:34,067
He likes to show off his muscles.

792
01:10:34,693 --> 01:10:37,362
I'll show them off on you,
if you get any mouthier.

793
01:10:43,368 --> 01:10:46,079
I don't know if you ought to be
in this rumble.

794
01:10:46,287 --> 01:10:48,998
How come? I've always
come through before, ain't l?

795
01:10:50,583 --> 01:10:53,086
You were in shape before.

796
01:10:54,671 --> 01:10:57,799
You ain't looking so good,
you're tensed up all the time.

797
01:10:58,299 --> 01:11:01,469
Come on, it's a fight.
Everyone is tensed up before a rumble.

798
01:11:02,387 --> 01:11:04,889
It's skin against skin.
He ain't gonna get hurt.

799
01:11:07,058 --> 01:11:08,893
I'll grab a little one.

800
01:11:09,686 --> 01:11:13,064
We will need every man we can get,
but I don't know.

801
01:11:13,189 --> 01:11:16,776
If it was with knives or chains,
it would be different.

802
01:11:16,776 --> 01:11:18,194
I'll be okay.

803
01:11:19,195 --> 01:11:22,198
All right, but you be careful.

804
01:11:22,365 --> 01:11:23,575
I will.

805
01:11:23,867 --> 01:11:25,994
Why don't you worry about him so much?

806
01:11:26,161 --> 01:11:30,665
That's one kid brother I ain't gotta worry
about 'cause he can use his head...

807
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:33,376
...at least to grow hair on. Let's go!

808
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:03,073
You and Ponyboy, if the fuzz show,
beat it out of there.

809
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:06,368
We'll get jailed, but you two will get
the boy's home. Understand?

810
01:12:06,576 --> 01:12:09,996
Ain't nobody gonna call the fuzz
in this neighborhood.

811
01:12:12,499 --> 01:12:15,669
All the same, you two beat it out of there.
Do you hear me?

812
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:33,561
How are you doing, Tim?

813
01:12:34,396 --> 01:12:35,689
Pretty good.

814
01:12:38,692 --> 01:12:41,194
You and the quiet kid killed the Soc.
Right?

815
01:12:41,861 --> 01:12:43,196
Yeah.

816
01:12:43,488 --> 01:12:44,864
Good going, kid.

817
01:12:45,365 --> 01:12:47,367
Curly always said you were a good kid.

818
01:12:48,993 --> 01:12:52,288
Curly's in the reformatory
for the next six months.

819
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:57,794
-Hey, Greasers!
-We're on our way!

820
01:14:10,283 --> 01:14:13,578
We'll go out there as even as we can get.
You stay close to me, kid.

821
01:14:33,890 --> 01:14:36,267
Hello, Darrel. Long time no see.

822
01:14:37,686 --> 01:14:38,770
Hello, Paul.

823
01:14:39,062 --> 01:14:40,271
What's up?

824
01:14:40,397 --> 01:14:42,982
They used to buddy around together,
play football.

825
01:14:43,692 --> 01:14:44,984
I'll take you.

826
01:14:46,695 --> 01:14:48,780
A rumble ain't a rumble without me.

827
01:16:47,482 --> 01:16:49,275
Ponyboy, are you okay?

828
01:17:08,169 --> 01:17:10,463
Are you okay? Come on.

829
01:17:39,659 --> 01:17:43,580
Act sick, and I'll pretend like
I'm taking you to the hospital.

830
01:17:44,664 --> 01:17:47,584
You've got to have a good reason
for driving like that.

831
01:17:48,668 --> 01:17:52,672
The kid fell off his motorcycle
and I'm taking him to the hospital.

832
01:17:59,179 --> 01:18:00,263
How bad is he?

833
01:18:00,972 --> 01:18:03,975
Do I look like a doctor?
He looks pretty bad to me.

834
01:18:03,975 --> 01:18:05,477
Follow me.

835
01:18:08,772 --> 01:18:10,065
Sucker.

836
01:18:36,091 --> 01:18:37,884
I was crazy. You know that?

837
01:18:38,259 --> 01:18:41,388
I was crazy about wanting Johnny
to stay out of trouble.

838
01:18:41,471 --> 01:18:44,391
If he was smart like me,
he wouldn't be in this mess.

839
01:18:44,391 --> 01:18:47,769
If he was smart like me,
he wouldn't have ran in that church.

840
01:18:49,896 --> 01:18:52,691
You better wise up, man.
You just better wise up.

841
01:18:53,692 --> 01:18:56,277
Get tough like me and you don't get hurt.

842
01:18:58,988 --> 01:19:02,575
Watch out for yourself
and nothing can touch you, man.

843
01:19:21,761 --> 01:19:25,473
We beat the Socs, man. Chased them
right out of our neighborhood.

844
01:19:27,475 --> 01:19:29,060
It's useless.

845
01:19:31,771 --> 01:19:33,690
Fighting ain't no good.

846
01:19:37,694 --> 01:19:41,698
They're still writing editorials in the papers
about you being a hero.

847
01:19:43,491 --> 01:19:46,286
We are all proud of you.
It's gonna be all right.

848
01:19:58,673 --> 01:20:00,967
Stay gold, Ponyboy.

849
01:20:03,261 --> 01:20:04,679
Stay gold.

850
01:20:16,274 --> 01:20:17,776
Johnny, come on.

851
01:20:23,281 --> 01:20:26,159
So, this is what you get for helping people?

852
01:20:29,662 --> 01:20:30,789
You punk!

853
01:20:31,790 --> 01:20:33,792
Come on, Johnny, don't die.

854
01:20:38,588 --> 01:20:40,882
Come on, don't die on me now.

855
01:20:42,467 --> 01:20:43,677
Please!

856
01:20:50,684 --> 01:20:51,976
Bastards!

857
01:21:23,466 --> 01:21:25,468
You're not allowed here.

858
01:21:28,888 --> 01:21:31,099
I'm allowed anywhere I want.

859
01:21:34,894 --> 01:21:37,564
-You're out of your mind.
-Why do you help people?

860
01:21:38,481 --> 01:21:40,275
It doesn't do any good.

861
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:45,864
What do you think, Soda?
Do you think it makes me look tough?

862
01:21:46,698 --> 01:21:48,658
It makes you look different.

863
01:21:49,868 --> 01:21:51,786
That guy had sharp teeth.

864
01:21:52,662 --> 01:21:54,664
What do you mean by "different"?

865
01:21:54,873 --> 01:21:56,875
You got a hole in your mouth.

866
01:22:01,379 --> 01:22:02,964
Where have you been?

867
01:22:12,182 --> 01:22:13,892
What's wrong?

868
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:17,187
Johnny's dead.

869
01:22:24,194 --> 01:22:26,363
Told him about beating the Socs.

870
01:22:27,197 --> 01:22:28,782
He just died.

871
01:22:29,699 --> 01:22:31,284
Told me to "stay gold."

872
01:22:34,371 --> 01:22:35,872
Dally's gone.

873
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:40,085
He couldn't take it. He's gonna blow.

874
01:23:04,984 --> 01:23:06,986
Do you want to buy one of those?

875
01:23:13,493 --> 01:23:16,162
You tear them, you have to pay for them.
Don't do that!

876
01:23:24,796 --> 01:23:26,965
You gotta pay for that magazine.

877
01:23:31,386 --> 01:23:33,179
Oh, God. Don't shoot.

878
01:23:34,597 --> 01:23:36,891
Give me the money. Give me the money!

879
01:23:37,267 --> 01:23:38,893
I'm so sick of you punks.

880
01:23:39,561 --> 01:23:41,062
Take it and get out!

881
01:24:10,091 --> 01:24:11,885
-Hello, Darrel?
{y:i}-No, it's Steve.

882
01:24:11,968 --> 01:24:14,262
Steve, I want to talk to Darry.

883
01:24:20,477 --> 01:24:24,272
{y:i}I robbed a store.
{y:i}The cops are looking for me.

884
01:24:24,981 --> 01:24:27,859
-Can you meet me in the park?
{y:i}-Sure. Are you all right?

885
01:24:27,859 --> 01:24:29,861
-Johnny's dead.
{y:i}-We know.

886
01:24:32,197 --> 01:24:35,367
-Meet me in the park, will you?
{y:i}-We'll be right there.

887
01:24:37,994 --> 01:24:40,789
It was Dally. The cops are after him.
We have to hide him.

888
01:24:58,098 --> 01:24:59,474
You'll never get me alive!

889
01:24:59,474 --> 01:25:00,475
Drop it!

890
01:25:01,393 --> 01:25:02,769
It's not loaded! Don't!

891
01:25:02,894 --> 01:25:04,187
Stop!

892
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:06,898
Not Dally, too!

893
01:25:10,485 --> 01:25:12,070
He's just a kid.

894
01:25:19,494 --> 01:25:20,578
Pony?

895
01:26:07,292 --> 01:26:10,879
"I asked the nurse to give you this book,
so you could finish it.

896
01:26:11,171 --> 01:26:14,799
"It was worth saving those kids because
their lives are worth more than mine.

897
01:26:14,883 --> 01:26:18,887
"They have more to live for.
Tell Dally I think it's worth it.

898
01:26:21,389 --> 01:26:22,891
"I'm gonna miss you guys.

899
01:26:22,891 --> 01:26:26,561
"I've been thinking about it, and that poem,
that guy that wrote it.

900
01:26:27,562 --> 01:26:31,399
"He meant you're gold when you're a kid,
like green.

901
01:26:33,068 --> 01:26:36,488
"When you're a kid everything's new.
Dawn.

902
01:26:38,198 --> 01:26:40,867
"Like the way you dig sunsets, that's gold.

903
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:44,371
"Keep it that way. It's a good way to be.

904
01:26:46,373 --> 01:26:50,377
"I want you to ask Dally to look at one.
I don't think he's ever seen a sunset.

905
01:26:52,295 --> 01:26:54,798
"There's still lots of good in the world.

906
01:26:56,091 --> 01:26:58,677
"Tell Dally, I don't think he knows.

907
01:26:59,886 --> 01:27:01,596
"Your buddy, Johnny."

908
01:27:34,379 --> 01:27:38,675
{y:i}"When I stepped out
{y:i}into the bright sunlight...

909
01:27:40,677 --> 01:27:42,095
{y:i}"...from the darkness...."
