00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,541
How is your Uncle Charlie?

177
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,208
How are you? He wants to know.

178
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,125
I'm still short 30 bucks.

179
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,208
Tell him the Mets play the Braves
tomorrow night.

180
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,458
JR:
Mets play the Braves tomorrow night.

181
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,916
Doesn't mean he's gonna show up.

182
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,958
THE VOICE:
Well, I will tell you what, sport.

183
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,916
I'll get a couple tickets. (clears throat)

184
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,333
And I will pick you up
at your grandfather's at 6:30.

185
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,791
JR:
Great. Thank you.

186
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,083
THE VOICE: We got a lot
to catch up on, you and me.

187
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,291
Okay.

188
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,166
- Bye, now.
- Bye.

189
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,291
You gonna get my cigarettes?

190
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,541
Oh.

191
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,000
PRIEST:
Are you reading this paper?

192
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,500
- Oh, no.
- Great.

193
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,333
(chuckles softly)

194
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,708
I... I got an interview at Yale.

195
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,583
(chuckles)

196
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,708
FUTURE JR:
He said to be ready at 6:30.

197
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:22,250
I was ready at 4:30 so as not to fuck up.

198
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,333
You always remember fucking up,
so you don't want to.

199
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:30,666
The thing is, that day, I felt like I had.

200
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,875
That's the thing to remember about a kid.

201
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,500
The kid always thinks he fucked up.

202
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,500
I didn't know what he looked like.

203
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:42,208
I hadn't been to New York City
to see his face on billboards and buses.

204
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,708
I couldn't have picked him out of a crowd.

205
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,916
But I wondered if it was like
a thing you would always know,

206
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,791
as if you would always know
your father instantly.

207
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,375
It was possible.

208
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,791
- (crickets chirping)
- (dog barking in distance)

209
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,875

210
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,958
(brakes squeaking)

211
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,416
- (engine shuts off)

212
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,333
(door closes)

213
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,458
A little while later,
after being arrested while on air

214
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:18,333
for nonpayment of child support,

215
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,333
The Voice fled the state.

216
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,291
It was about this same period
that he called up drunk

217
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:27,416
and said he put a contract
on my mother's life.

218
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,083
He also threatened to kidnap me,

219
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,708
but Uncle Charlie thought
this was a less serious threat,

220
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:34,333
as kidnapping comes with responsibilities.

221
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,875
MOM:
We're the Two Musketeers, right?

222
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,833
Yeah.

Let me show you something, okay?

225
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,666
This is the male sciences, all right?

226
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,416
You get your drink.

227
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,208
That goes there.

228
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,833
Got your pack of butts, right?

229
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,708
That goes there.

230
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,833
See that? Look at...
look at this guy right there.

231
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,333
See how he's putting his money
in his pocket like that?

232
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,583
- Yeah.
- Never do that.

233
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,333
That's keeping your money like a drunk.

234
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,625
It's not correct.

235
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,125
Know what you also do?

236
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,958
You take care of your mother.

237
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,916
All right?

238
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,458
All right, give me a hand.

239
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,666
And you take care of,
if you have one, your woman.

240
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,708
If you drink, you keep your shit together.

241
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,833
If your shit's not together,
you don't drink.

242
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,791
Don't be like one of these assholes here
who acts like

243
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,958
it was Jesus who came down
and made him late for work

244
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,833
and spend all their money and throw back

246
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,791
You know what I'm saying?
It's about being a man.

247
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,708
Get your drink. You get your butts.

248
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:43,375
Don't carry your money like a drunk.
Oh, and, uh...

249
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,333
See this? This little compartment
in your wallet, right?

250
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,666
That's where you keep your stashies.

251
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,208
That's like a hundred bucks,
five, whatever,

252
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,250
depending on the economy.

253
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:57,500
Important thing is you never,
ever drink that money, right?

254
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,500
What else? Hold doors.

255
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,083
Be good to your mother.

256
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,375
Teach you how to change a tire,
jump a car.

257
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:04,750
You know, that's it.

258
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,708
Change a tire, jump a car, take care
of your mother, don't drink your stashies.

259
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:11,000
Oh, one more thing... very important.

260
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,250
Never under any circumstances hit a woman,

261
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,791
even if she stabs you with scissors.

262
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:17,916
Got it.

263
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,708
That's it. Male sciences. Right.

264
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,708
Can people read those books?

265
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,875
Can they read...

266
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,583
What are you, soft?

267
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,041
No, I mean, can I read them?

268
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,416
What's the name of this place?

269
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,750
The Dickens.

270
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,666
That's right.

271
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,458
Charles Dickens. You know who that is?

272
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,083
- The owner?
- (chuckles)

273
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,208
Yes, you can read 'em.
You can read as many as you like.

274
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,833
Take 'em in the poker room. Read 'em all.

275
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,541
Fill yourself up.

276
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,458
And you know what might happen?

277
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:51,166
If you read enough books,
maybe, if you're lucky,

278
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,458
you could become a writer.

279
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,541
FUTURE JR:
And that was it.

280
00:14:56,625 --> 00:15:00,083
From that moment on,
I wanted to be a writer.

But here is this... the furniture is
held together with duct tape,

289
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,250

He's farting and saying he didn't do it,

290
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,208
saying "apricots" for no reason.

You are a stingy, crazy, old bastard.

294
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,125
You are not stingy with money.

295
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,416
Haven't got any.

296
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,875
- You are stingy with love.
- (passes gas)

297
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,500
I didn't do that.

298
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,708
Girls become wives and mothers.
That was his point of view.

299
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,458
- You became one of them.
- Oh, shut up, you old turd!

300
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,458
- (scoffs)
- Because he is stingy

that he's a junior

have occurred to him until you just

laid your line of bullshit
on the subject to him right to his face.

435
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:45,291
It is my belief that the uncertainty
about the meaning of his name

436
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:48,541
and the continual questions about it
have left him without identity.

437
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:52,500
Very impressive.
No identity, hence identity crisis.

438
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:55,083
He has no identity, which causes rage.

439
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:59,041
He has dubiety
about his identity, possibly.

443
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:11,666

in this very negative light

444
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:15,000
and bring the kid in here
and you're traumatizing him.

447
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,833

00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:49,333
The first half of the Iliad.

872
00:44:50,375 --> 00:44:52,041
No, right, but on what subject?

873
00:44:52,125 --> 00:44:55,375
The first half of the Iliad.

874
00:44:56,708 --> 00:44:58,791
He's throwing down.

875
00:44:58,875 --> 00:45:02,583
VAN DYKE:
Now, as some of you hopefully may know,

876
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:06,791
the Iliad is an ancient Greek epic poem
in dactylic hexameter...

877
00:45:06,875 --> 00:45:08,000
- Hey.
- Hmm?

878
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:09,375
- Who is that?
- Who?

879
00:45:09,458 --> 00:45:10,791
In the purple.

880
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,000
- WESLEY: Ah. She goes out with Stinky.
- JR: Stinky?

881
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:15,416
Yeah, he's wealthy.

882
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,958
VAN DYKE: ...grand style
of Western classical poetry.

883
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:21,375
So take note of these
and other examples of its use

884
00:45:21,458 --> 00:45:23,958
as you make your way through the text.

885
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:25,458
Ovid's Metamorphos...

886
00:45:25,541 --> 00:45:27,541
(crickets chirping)

887
00:45:28,583 --> 00:45:30,958
Because everything I see is unattainable.

888
00:45:31,041 --> 00:45:33,000
That's because you're probably
being a pussy.

889
00:45:33,083 --> 00:45:34,708
Well, if you're made to read
the greatest things ever written,

890
00:45:34,791 --> 00:45:36,291
that you couldn't do,
and make you feel like shit,

891
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:37,916
then how are you supposed
to become a writer?

892
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,291
Socrates says you learn more
from a bad book than a good one.

893
00:45:40,375 --> 00:45:42,958
Aristotle. I think.

894
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:45,416
If you go to Yale
but you don't have any balls,

895
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,333
how are you supposed
to be a student at Yale?

896
00:45:47,416 --> 00:45:50,041
I'm just here on a lucky break.
It's just a lucky break.

897
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:52,750
I mean, I can do Wordy Gurdy all day long,

898
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:56,125
but I cannot figure out what the fuck
they are saying in Henry V.

899
00:45:56,208 --> 00:45:58,958
We're all here on a lucky break,
douchebag.

900
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:01,791
I'm Lucky Sperm Club, and no one's
ever noticed that I'm an idiot.

901
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:03,500
It's also luck. Everybody's lucky.

902
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:06,250
Everybody alive is lucky

903
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:08,041
and were descended from the lucky.

904
00:46:08,125 --> 00:46:10,833
Our ancestors were all either fast, smart

905
00:46:10,916 --> 00:46:13,333
or had really fucking good immune systems.

906
00:46:13,416 --> 00:46:16,750
Luck, asshole... it's why we're all here.

907
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:20,208
Hmm. I never thought about it like that.

908
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:23,083
You see, you're believing
in society's bullshit interpretation

909
00:46:23,166 --> 00:46:26,416
of you and everything else,
and that is why you can't write.

910
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,583
Not because Homer
makes you think you suck.

911
00:46:28,666 --> 00:46:30,500
(chuckles softly)

912
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:32,625
I'd really like for you
to meet my Uncle Charlie.

913
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:35,000
What's he do?

914
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,333
He runs a bar.

915
00:46:37,416 --> 00:46:39,416
I would really like to meet
your Uncle Charlie.

916
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,500
("Dynaflow" by Parish Hall playing)

917
00:46:41,583 --> 00:46:43,583
(indistinct chatter)

918
00:46:46,916 --> 00:46:49,291
- (door opens)
- JR: You got your I.D.'s, right?

919
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:52,583
Hey! The fuck are you guys doing here?

920
00:46:54,833 --> 00:46:57,750
Jesus Christ.

921
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,583
What about these rejects?

922
00:47:02,833 --> 00:47:05,333
Hmm. Okay.

923
00:47:05,416 --> 00:47:07,666
Well, welcome to our shores, Jim.

924
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:09,666
Hey, I got an announcement.

925
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:11,416
- (bell jingling)
- Everybody,

926
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,541
according to the laws
of the sovereign state of New York,

927
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:16,708
today, my nephew is officially a man.

928
00:47:16,791 --> 00:47:18,750
And so are his friends legally men.

929
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:21,250
- The law is fucked!
- Get these assholes a drink on me.

930
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:23,500
Fuck you. First one is mine.

931
00:47:23,583 --> 00:47:25,083
Mine.

932
00:47:25,166 --> 00:47:26,833
Then you guys are backed up on Joey D.

933
00:47:26,916 --> 00:47:29,208
- What do you want?
- Wow. Uh...

934
00:47:29,291 --> 00:47:31,750
Well, I don't even know what to have.

935
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:34,166
I think a Yale man
should drink gin myself,

936
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:36,291
but... big decision, Chief.

937
00:47:36,375 --> 00:47:38,583
Whatever you assholes choose now
is what I'm gonna pour

938
00:47:38,666 --> 00:47:41,000
every time you walk in the door... forever.

939
00:47:42,083 --> 00:47:44,125
But you got to have a drink... your drink.

940
00:47:44,208 --> 00:47:45,833
(sighs) Gin makes me crazy.

941
00:47:45,916 --> 00:47:47,541
We can handle that.
We can handle anything.

942
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:49,291
I make an excellent gin martini.

943
00:47:49,375 --> 00:47:51,083
The secret is a few drops of Scotch.

944
00:47:51,166 --> 00:47:52,875
Come on, Chaz, back 'em up on me.

945
00:47:52,958 --> 00:47:54,750
CHIEF:
Back 'em up on me, too, Charlie.

946
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:59,000
Goodness. Evidently, tonight, you guys
are backed up on Chief and Joey D.

947
00:47:59,083 --> 00:48:00,958
Fasten your fucking seat belt.

948
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:05,291
(horns honking)

949
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,583
So you went to war?

950
00:48:06,666 --> 00:48:08,000
'Nam, Second Division.

951
00:48:08,083 --> 00:48:10,375
Quang Tri, '67 to '69.

952
00:48:10,458 --> 00:48:13,041
You little fuckers
will never know such things.

953
00:48:13,125 --> 00:48:17,625
All props to the 82nd, but your little
fucking airdrop on Grenada is not a war.

954
00:48:17,708 --> 00:48:20,500
- We didn't airdrop on Grenada.
- WESLEY: How long were you in the Army?

955
00:48:20,583 --> 00:48:22,708
One year, seven months, five days.

956
00:48:22,791 --> 00:48:24,000
How long were you in Vietnam?

957
00:48:24,083 --> 00:48:25,208
11 months, 12 days.

958
00:48:25,291 --> 00:48:27,916
Chaz says you're insecure at Yale.

959
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,708
Nah. No.

960
00:48:29,791 --> 00:48:32,375
Well, hey, it's the same as prison.

961
00:48:32,458 --> 00:48:34,166
Anywhere is the same as prison.

962
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:36,833
You need to find the main guy,
who's a problem,

963
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:38,375
and you rip his fucking lungs out.

964
00:48:38,458 --> 00:48:40,375
CHIEF:
The fuck you telling the kid that for?

965
00:48:40,458 --> 00:48:42,875
- That's it.
- He's going to Yale, not Rahway.

966
00:48:44,083 --> 00:48:48,041
You know, Uncle Charlie is, like,
your old man, basically.

967
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:50,333
No, he's my Uncle Charlie.

968
00:48:50,416 --> 00:48:52,458
My old man's in a radio.

969
00:48:52,541 --> 00:48:54,375
CHIEF:
Your old man's in a radio?

970
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:02,291
What are you reading this weekend?

971
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:03,916
Aquinas.

972
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,708
Oh, Jesus Christ.

973
00:49:06,791 --> 00:49:08,916
What? Thomas Aquinas.

974
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,250
Needed to believe there was a God,
so he offered the world concrete proof.

975
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:17,250
If you didn't believe his concrete proof,
the Church would cut your nuts off.

976
00:49:17,333 --> 00:49:18,958
- What are you worried about?
- I don't wanna.

977
00:49:19,041 --> 00:49:20,541
You don't wanna.

978
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:22,375
This is when you push.

979
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:23,833
Right now.

980
00:49:23,916 --> 00:49:25,500
This is when you bet it all.

981
00:49:25,583 --> 00:49:27,125
When you got nothing.

982
00:49:28,958 --> 00:49:31,166
All right, fuck this.

983
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:35,041
Read Orwell
on the lower-upper-middle classes.

984
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:37,541
They're the ones who really suck.

985
00:49:37,625 --> 00:49:41,250
Once you understand that,
you can operate in America.

986
00:49:41,333 --> 00:49:43,375
If you also have a car.

987
00:49:44,958 --> 00:49:47,041
("Good Times" by Chic playing)

988
00:49:47,125 --> 00:49:48,958
WESLEY:
Spent all of last summer in Europe.

989
00:49:49,041 --> 00:49:51,625
Italy. Jesus, Venice.
You ever been to Venice?

990
00:49:51,708 --> 00:49:53,041
No.

991
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:56,916
Most illogical city
I have ever seen in my life.

992
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,875
The cab is a boat.
The garbage truck is a boat.

993
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:01,708
Not one bit of it makes any sense.

994
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:03,291
So how'd you end up in Venice?

995
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,041
Studied hard. I got good grades.

996
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:06,916
My old man said, "Pick a city."

997
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,750
So, my brother used to make me go with him

998
00:50:08,833 --> 00:50:10,333
and watch Don't Look Now
with Donald Sutherland.

999
00:50:10,416 --> 00:50:11,958
Jesus. How old were you?

1000
00:50:12,041 --> 00:50:13,583
That movie made a man out of me.

1001
00:50:13,666 --> 00:50:15,041
But it took place in Venice.

1002
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:16,375
First movie was The Exorcist.

1003
00:50:16,458 --> 00:50:18,333
My brother had a hard-on
for Julie Christie.

1004
00:50:18,416 --> 00:50:20,500
Anyway, long story short, I picked Venice.

1005
00:50:20,583 --> 00:50:22,166
Three weeks turns into three months.

1006
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,541
And The Exorcist scared the fuck
out of me, by the way.

1007
00:50:24,625 --> 00:50:27,250
- The moral of the story is...
- Right, right. The moral of the story is

1008
00:50:27,333 --> 00:50:29,708
do well in school,
and you get to see Italy.

1009
00:50:29,791 --> 00:50:31,875
Sidney.

1010
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:33,416
Hi.

1011
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,666
- Hi.
- How are you? Uh, is Stinky in there?

1012
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:38,708
I don't know where Alex is.

1013
00:50:38,791 --> 00:50:40,458
I don't see much of him.

1014
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:41,583
Hey. JR.

1015
00:50:41,666 --> 00:50:43,791
- Sidney.
- Hey.

1016
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:45,416
You're in my class.

1017
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,125
I doubt it.

1018
00:50:47,208 --> 00:50:48,458
(both laughing)

1019
00:50:48,541 --> 00:50:51,416
So, uh, how's your Iliad?

1020
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,250
- Oh. (laughs)
- (JR chuckles)

1021
00:50:54,333 --> 00:50:56,125
- My Iliad's fine.
- Yeah?

1022
00:50:56,208 --> 00:50:57,791
Yeah. How's yours?

1023
00:50:57,875 --> 00:51:00,833
My Iliad is just getting better and better
as the evening progresses.

1024
00:51:00,916 --> 00:51:02,125
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

1025
00:51:02,208 --> 00:51:03,333
(laughs)

1026
00:51:06,791 --> 00:51:08,208
How-how was the party?

1027
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:10,000
Um, not great.

1028
00:51:10,083 --> 00:51:11,208
- No?
- No.

1029
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:12,375
Where you headed?

1030
00:51:13,458 --> 00:51:15,125
Walking home.

1031
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:17,208
I'll walk you.

1032
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:20,541

SIDNEY:
So, what does JR stand for?

1039
00:51:41,458 --> 00:51:43,375
It's a complicated thing.

1040
00:51:43,458 --> 00:51:46,041
I'll tell you when I know you better.

1041
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:47,750
Is there trauma?

Yes.

00:51:52,166 --> 00:51:53,875
Father-based?

1044
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,291
I'm named after my father.

1045
00:51:58,375 --> 00:52:00,583
But I've only seen him a couple of times.

1046
00:52:00,666 --> 00:52:03,958
He was always on the radio, in New York.

1047
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:09,375
He was Johnny Ace
or Johnny Michaels on the radio.

1048
00:52:11,625 --> 00:52:13,541
Are you in search for your father?

1049
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:18,125
(chuckling):
No, I'm not.

1050
00:52:18,208 --> 00:52:20,916
If you have a father complex,
it's kind of a red flag.

1051
00:52:22,458 --> 00:52:25,500
Women with father complexes
tend to eat a lot,

1052
00:52:25,583 --> 00:52:29,500
but men get really fucked-up.

1053
00:52:29,583 --> 00:52:31,416
I don't have a father complex.

1054
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,125
He's just a guy on the radio.

1055
00:52:33,208 --> 00:52:34,833
That's a relief.

1060

JR:
This seat taken?

1241
01:03:49,833 --> 01:03:51,708
Look who it is. Sit down there.

1242
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:54,833
FUTURE JR:
My senior year was gonna be epic.

1243
01:03:54,916 --> 01:03:58,041
Writing for the paper, working at the bar.

1244
01:03:58,125 --> 01:03:59,875
This was gonna be my year.

1245
01:03:59,958 --> 01:04:01,791
I didn't need Sidney.

1246
01:04:01,875 --> 01:04:03,708
In fact, fuck Sidney.

1247
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:06,500
PRIEST:
Are you any good at writing?

1248
01:04:06,583 --> 01:04:09,916
I fear that sometimes
the question is too little asked.

1249
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,625
I don't know.

1250
01:04:12,708 --> 01:04:14,333
I have stuff in the Yale paper.

1251
01:04:14,416 --> 01:04:16,125
A lot of people don't.

1252
01:04:16,208 --> 01:04:17,583
Lot of people do. (chuckles)

1253
01:04:20,041 --> 01:04:22,125
I always love to see you on this train.

1254
01:04:23,208 --> 01:04:24,750
What's your main trouble?

1255
01:04:24,833 --> 01:04:26,791
I'm just a poor boy who wants a rich girl.

1256
01:04:26,875 --> 01:04:28,458
(chuckles softly)

1257
01:04:28,541 --> 01:04:29,708
That's been done.

1258
01:04:29,791 --> 01:04:31,208
She's not really rich.

1259
01:04:31,291 --> 01:04:33,625
She's lower-upper-middle.

1260
01:04:33,708 --> 01:04:36,708
Well, you never see the real rich.
They're invisible.

1261
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:40,791
Do you have plans in your head
to make something of yourself,

1262
01:04:40,875 --> 01:04:42,708
go and sweep her away?

1263
01:04:45,708 --> 01:04:47,125
Maybe.

1264
01:04:47,208 --> 01:04:49,625
If she loved you, she'd take you poor.

1265
01:04:51,208 --> 01:04:52,625
Heard it here first.

1266
01:04:52,708 --> 01:04:54,000
(chuckles)

1267
01:04:54,083 --> 01:04:56,041
I've heard it from someone else.

1268
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:59,208
Also, the Gatsby thing, you know?

1269
01:05:00,333 --> 01:05:03,458
Well, what's your main theme?
Since it isn't really that one.

1270
01:05:03,541 --> 01:05:07,000
The absent father. You know that one?

1271
01:05:08,083 --> 01:05:11,125
Sure, how else do you think
people become priests?

1272
01:05:11,208 --> 01:05:12,958
(chuckles)

1273
01:05:17,333 --> 01:05:19,333
(knocking)

1274
01:05:33,583 --> 01:05:35,583
(sighs)

1275
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:43,208
You know, you really had me going.

1276
01:05:43,291 --> 01:05:45,208
About what?

1277
01:05:45,291 --> 01:05:50,000
Well, for the past year...
Year and a half, frankly...

1278
01:05:50,083 --> 01:05:52,416
It's... my life's been hell.

1279
01:05:53,625 --> 01:05:55,500
About me?

1280
01:05:55,583 --> 01:05:57,291
- Yes, about you.
- (chuckles)

1281
01:05:58,291 --> 01:06:00,166
What do you want from me?

1282
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:03,958
Well, we're seniors.

1283
01:06:06,291 --> 01:06:07,958
I'm getting agita.

1284
01:06:08,041 --> 01:06:12,041
Is agita the root of agitation?

1285
01:06:12,125 --> 01:06:14,458
No. Men who want things are.

1286
01:06:14,541 --> 01:06:18,083
You know, I think you think
I want something that I'm not thinking.

1287
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,166
Unless you want me to think it.

1288
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:27,416
I'm seeing someone.

1289
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,541
You got to be fucking kidding me.

1290
01:06:32,625 --> 01:06:35,958
FUTURE JR: I can't explain it, really,
why I kept going back.

1291
01:06:36,041 --> 01:06:38,500
She just had my number.

1292
01:06:38,583 --> 01:06:42,000
WESLEY: All right,
so she gets agita, whatever that is.

1293
01:06:42,083 --> 01:06:44,125
JR:
It's Yiddish for "nerves."

1294
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:47,750
WESLEY: All right, so she gets that
and she needs her space

1295
01:06:47,833 --> 01:06:50,750
and her time and all that, right?

1296
01:06:50,833 --> 01:06:52,958
So I have a question for you.

1297
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:56,250
What do you need?

1298
01:06:58,708 --> 01:07:01,458
Look, I'm not a genius.
It's an obvious question.

1299
01:07:01,541 --> 01:07:04,791
What do I want?
I want to be a writer, but I suck.

1300
01:07:04,875 --> 01:07:07,583
Well, when you suck at writing,
that's when you become a journalist.

1301
01:07:07,666 --> 01:07:09,333
I'm not going to law school.

1302
01:07:09,416 --> 01:07:11,250
Neither am I.

1303
01:07:14,125 --> 01:07:17,250
- My mom, she...
- Your mom wants you happy.

1304
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:19,625
Yeah, she does.

1305
01:07:19,708 --> 01:07:21,833
Neither of us know how.

1306
01:07:29,208 --> 01:07:31,750
Let's go back and get graduated.

1307
01:07:32,833 --> 01:07:34,416
(chuckles)

1308
01:07:36,375 --> 01:07:38,000
All right.

1309
01:07:43,583 --> 01:07:45,791
- I'm here. I understand it's a big deal.
- Do you?

1310
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:47,791
- Yeah.
- He graduated from Yale.

1311
01:07:47,875 --> 01:07:49,666
Your father graduated from Dartmouth.

1312
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:53,541
SPEAKER: So, without further ado,
let's bring them in.

1313
01:07:53,625 --> 01:07:55,708
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's give a warm welcome

1314
01:07:55,791 --> 01:07:58,541
to the Yale class of 1986.

1315
01:07:58,625 --> 01:08:01,541
(Valentin Haussmann's
"Polnischer Tanz, Deutscher Tanz" playing)

1316
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:09,208
(applause)

1317
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,416
- (knocking)
- JIMMY: There's a call for you.

1318
01:08:31,541 --> 01:08:33,375
Hello?

1319
01:08:33,458 --> 01:08:35,083
THE VOICE:
Remember me?

1320
01:08:36,458 --> 01:08:37,875
Hey, Dad.

1321
01:08:37,958 --> 01:08:39,958
I-I-I didn't make it, as you know.

1322
01:08:40,041 --> 01:08:42,208
Uh, no... no surprise there.

1323
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:46,333
Uh, but I did want to tell you that, uh...

1324
01:08:46,416 --> 01:08:48,166
I quit drinking.

1325
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:51,166
And, uh, I've been here and there...

1326
01:08:52,666 --> 01:08:54,666
(laughs) …apologizing

1327
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:58,375
and... you made the list.

1328
01:08:58,458 --> 01:09:01,291
- Wow.
- Oh, come on. Don't fuck with me.

1329
01:09:02,958 --> 01:09:04,583
Hey, I'm glad you made it.

1330
01:09:04,666 --> 01:09:06,625
Uh, I was worried.

1331
01:09:06,708 --> 01:09:09,000
College ain't for everybody.

1332
01:09:09,083 --> 01:09:12,375
It was for Mom, but you got her pregnant.

1333
01:09:12,458 --> 01:09:16,250
Yes, well, we all have to paddle
our own canoe, JR.

1334
01:09:16,333 --> 01:09:19,416
Seems like your mother's got you
paddling hers a little bit.

1335
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:24,375
I think she's been paddling both of ours
for a very long time.

1336
01:09:27,541 --> 01:09:28,958
Maybe.

1337
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:33,250
Uh, all right, well, I'm on the air
in 15 and change.

1338
01:09:33,333 --> 01:09:34,750
I got to go.

1339
01:09:34,833 --> 01:09:37,041
- Where are you?
- (click, dial tone)

1340
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:44,583
MOM:
What law schools are you looking at?

1341
01:09:45,666 --> 01:09:46,958
None.

1342
01:09:47,041 --> 01:09:48,791
I'm gonna be a novelist.

1343
01:09:52,791 --> 01:09:54,375
Where you gonna live?

1344
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:57,750
At Grandpa's, like everybody.

1345
01:09:57,833 --> 01:09:59,250
We all go to Grandpa's.

1346
01:09:59,333 --> 01:10:03,000
I mean, I-I know you think this is
supposed to change everything, but...

1347
01:10:03,083 --> 01:10:04,416
You have to have a job.

1348
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:07,166
I will have a job... writing a novel.

1349
01:10:09,333 --> 01:10:11,583
Publishing is going more towards memoir.

1350
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:13,375
(chuckles) That's true.

1351
01:10:19,708 --> 01:10:21,708
Here.

1352
01:10:21,791 --> 01:10:23,416
Is this for Sidney?

1353
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,250
No.

1354
01:10:25,333 --> 01:10:26,875
Open it.

1355
01:10:34,125 --> 01:10:35,333
It's a Yale ring.

1356
01:10:35,416 --> 01:10:37,916
I don't like male jewelry, but I thought,

1357
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,750
since the Musketeers
actually did this together...

1358
01:10:41,833 --> 01:10:43,541
It's for you.

1359
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:51,583
(JR chuckles)

1360
01:10:59,875 --> 01:11:01,708
WESLEY:
Jesus, fuck.

1361
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:04,541
Symbolically,
you just married your mother.

1362
01:11:04,625 --> 01:11:06,541
- Whoa. Take it easy.
- All right, all right, all right.

1363
01:11:06,625 --> 01:11:09,375
So let's say... let's say you closed
the circle with one parent, right?

1364
01:11:09,458 --> 01:11:11,291
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Maybe.

1365
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:13,125
What about The Voice?

1366
01:11:13,208 --> 01:11:15,458
- I don't even know where he is.
- CHARLIE: The Voice...

1367
01:11:15,541 --> 01:11:18,666
locked in a downward spiral
since the Carter administration.

1368
01:11:19,833 --> 01:11:23,083
So both you assholes just graduated?

1369
01:11:23,166 --> 01:11:25,833
Charlie, back 'em up on me.

1370
01:11:25,916 --> 01:11:27,458
- Aw.
- Thanks, Chief.

1371
01:11:27,541 --> 01:11:30,500
CHIEF: So, how much do they get
for a Yale education these days?

1372
01:11:30,583 --> 01:11:32,000
Oh, it's 60 grand.

1373
01:11:32,083 --> 01:11:34,958
- 60?
- JR got grants and scholarships.

1374
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:37,250
Wesley, you were a full-ticket guy?

1375
01:11:37,333 --> 01:11:38,541
CHIEF:
All right, answer me this.

1376
01:11:38,625 --> 01:11:42,041
What year... was the Magna Carta signed?

1377
01:11:43,125 --> 01:11:45,041
- I don't know.
- I don't fucking know.

1378
01:11:45,125 --> 01:11:47,958
- Survey says...
- 1215.

1379
01:11:48,041 --> 01:11:50,541
It's the foundation of English law.
You should know it.

1380
01:11:50,625 --> 01:11:52,708
- Bulwark against tyranny.
- King John.

1381
01:11:52,791 --> 01:11:54,625
- CHIEF: That's right.
- WESLEY: At this point, Chief,

1382
01:11:54,708 --> 01:11:57,125
- I don't give a shit.
- CHIEF: He doesn't give a shit.

1383
01:11:57,208 --> 01:12:00,000
Kid, I'm just trying to keep you
out of the ruling classes. That's all.

1384
01:12:00,083 --> 01:12:01,750
Too late, Chief. Too late.

1385
01:12:01,833 --> 01:12:04,833
$60,000. My house cost $12,000.

1386
01:12:04,916 --> 01:12:07,875
- Your house cost $7,000.
- My house cost $7,000.

1387
01:12:10,791 --> 01:12:12,958
JR: I was kind of into
the "clean break" idea.

1388
01:12:13,041 --> 01:12:14,666
SIDNEY (laughs):
We can be friends.

1389
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:16,708
Just not romantic or sexual.

1390
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:18,833
That sounds appealing.

1391
01:12:18,916 --> 01:12:20,333
(Sidney laughs)

1392
01:12:20,416 --> 01:12:22,791
So, what are you doing?

1393
01:12:22,875 --> 01:12:24,291
I'm at the bar a lot.

1394
01:12:24,375 --> 01:12:26,458
I'm working on my novel.

1395
01:12:28,125 --> 01:12:30,166
Publishing is heading towards memoir.

1396
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:32,833
People have been saying that. Yeah.

1397
01:12:32,916 --> 01:12:34,875
So, how many pages do you have?

1398
01:12:36,708 --> 01:12:38,041
Many.

1399
01:12:39,166 --> 01:12:40,875
Have you applied to newspapers?

1400
01:12:40,958 --> 01:12:43,125
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You have clips?

1401
01:12:43,208 --> 01:12:44,958
You contacted The New York Times?

1402
01:12:45,041 --> 01:12:47,500
Would you like it if I was at The Times?

1403
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:50,875
I love you anyway.

1404
01:12:50,958 --> 01:12:52,750
I just don't want a relationship.

1405
01:12:52,833 --> 01:12:54,250
But you have a relationship.

1406
01:12:54,333 --> 01:12:57,250
It's just not romantic or sexual.

1407
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:05,708
I think The Times is probably
out of my league.

1408
01:13:07,375 --> 01:13:09,208
Was Yale out of your league?

1409
01:13:10,291 --> 01:13:12,625
- Can we just go to your place?
- No.

1410
01:13:14,166 --> 01:13:15,708
I live with him.

1411
01:13:20,333 --> 01:13:23,625
CHARLIE: So, Sidney saw you
in your reduced condition.

1412
01:13:24,708 --> 01:13:26,833
- But she was checking up on you.
- Yeah.

1413
01:13:26,916 --> 01:13:29,000
She was trying to see if you had
your shit together.

1414
01:13:29,083 --> 01:13:31,458
(laughing):
Uh...

1415
01:13:31,541 --> 01:13:35,291
I don't even have any shit
to get together.

1416
01:13:35,375 --> 01:13:38,166
- I don't. I don't have anything.
- Hey. Hey, hey, listen.

1417
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:41,666
What did I tell you
about the male sciences?

1418
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,375
- Remember that?
- Yeah.

1419
01:13:43,458 --> 01:13:45,375
- Right? Have a job.
- Right.

1420
01:13:45,458 --> 01:13:46,625
- Have a car.
- Yeah.

1421
01:13:46,708 --> 01:13:48,750
- Put all your shit in it.
- I don't have any of that.

1422
01:13:48,833 --> 01:13:52,583
So you can be independent,
and then somebody might want you.

1423
01:13:52,666 --> 01:13:55,208
And if they don't,
you get the fuck out of there.

1424
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:58,541
Right?

1425
01:13:58,625 --> 01:14:00,291
(JR breathing deeply)

1426
01:14:01,375 --> 01:14:04,208
- (phone rings)
- WOMAN: New York Times.

1427
01:14:04,291 --> 01:14:06,375
Yes. Can I tell him who's calling?

1428
01:14:08,125 --> 01:14:09,458
MAN:
Take care.

1429
01:14:09,541 --> 01:14:11,541
(indistinct chatter)

1430
01:14:12,916 --> 01:14:14,875
- (phone rings)
- WOMAN: New York Times.

1431
01:14:15,916 --> 01:14:17,083
- Hi. Are you JR?
- Yes.

1432
01:14:17,166 --> 01:14:18,625
Yeah, you can come with me.

1433
01:14:19,708 --> 01:14:22,041
WOMAN:
We all like your clips from New Haven.

1434
01:14:22,125 --> 01:14:23,875
Where are you working now?

1435
01:14:23,958 --> 01:14:25,875
I'm writing fiction, I think.

1436
01:14:25,958 --> 01:14:29,583
And I work at a family business.

1437
01:14:30,583 --> 01:14:33,291
It's a hospitality business.

1438
01:14:33,375 --> 01:14:35,958
A bar on Long Island.

1439
01:14:36,041 --> 01:14:37,666
(chuckles)

1440
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:41,125
- Your clips are good, Mr. Maguire.
- They are?

1441
01:14:41,208 --> 01:14:43,875
The editors feel they need to see more
before they make a decision.

1442
01:14:43,958 --> 01:14:45,500
You want to see more?

1443
01:14:45,583 --> 01:14:46,916
Yes.

1444
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,125
Is that good?

1445
01:14:50,208 --> 01:14:52,000
Yes.

1446
01:14:52,083 --> 01:14:53,708
(sighs)

1447
01:14:54,916 --> 01:14:57,125
I don't have more.

1448
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,708
Let me tell Brian that.

1449
01:15:06,041 --> 01:15:07,875
Do you want to meet Brian?

1450
01:15:09,333 --> 01:15:12,208
(chuckles softly)
Not if I don't have a job.

1451
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:17,125
Why don't you come and meet him?

1452
01:15:18,125 --> 01:15:20,208
- (phones ringing)
- (heavy, indistinct chatter)

1453
01:15:20,291 --> 01:15:22,291
(typewriter keys clacking)

1454
01:15:43,416 --> 01:15:45,416
JR, come in.

1455
01:15:47,791 --> 01:15:49,250
Hi, sir.

1456
01:15:52,125 --> 01:15:53,958
CHARLIE:
So do not write to her

1457
01:15:54,041 --> 01:15:56,333
and tell her that you've
improved your position,

1458
01:15:56,416 --> 01:15:58,625
because that will take away
all the power and the majesty

1459
01:15:58,708 --> 01:16:00,208
of her finding this out for herself.

1460
01:16:00,291 --> 01:16:02,083
I already did.

1461
01:16:02,166 --> 01:16:05,541
Can you fucking come to me
with this shit, please?

1462
01:16:05,625 --> 01:16:08,625
Do not tell her you want her back.
Did you say that?

1463
01:16:08,708 --> 01:16:10,625
Uh, yeah. (chuckles)

1464
01:16:10,708 --> 01:16:12,541
Did you go and...

1465
01:16:12,625 --> 01:16:14,958
stare up at the building,
like, in the rain and shit?

1466
01:16:15,041 --> 01:16:16,375
No.

1467
01:16:17,458 --> 01:16:18,458
Sidney!

1468
01:16:18,541 --> 01:16:22,708
JR, this girl has abandoned you
how many times?

1469
01:16:23,791 --> 01:16:26,541
If someone abandons you,
what does that tell you?

1470
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:29,500
You, of all people.

1471
01:16:29,583 --> 01:16:31,791
She just needs time, you know?

1472
01:16:31,875 --> 01:16:34,958
Yeah, I think you're missing
a central fact,

1473
01:16:35,041 --> 01:16:38,625
which is that women decide
if they want something or if they don't,

1474
01:16:38,708 --> 01:16:40,833
and it becomes very obvious very fast.

1475
01:16:40,916 --> 01:16:43,500
- But...
- Women decide.

1476
01:16:43,583 --> 01:16:46,208
- I know, but...
- When you met, who decided?

1477
01:16:46,291 --> 01:16:49,083
- She did.
- There you go, numb nuts.

1478
01:16:49,166 --> 01:16:51,375
Standard pattern, obvious to all.

1479
01:16:51,458 --> 01:16:53,666
You do see a pattern, right?

1480
01:16:57,416 --> 01:16:58,833
Hey! (clears throat)

1481
01:16:58,916 --> 01:17:00,875
JR got a job at The Times.

1482
01:17:00,958 --> 01:17:02,958
(others cheering)

1483
01:17:05,333 --> 01:17:07,250
I'm a... I'm a copyboy.

1484
01:17:07,333 --> 01:17:09,625
- (laughing): You're a copyboy?
- I-I get sandwiches. I...

1485
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:12,041
Hey, Charlie, back him up on me.

1486
01:17:14,541 --> 01:17:18,375
So, your first byline
presents a, uh, problem.

1487
01:17:18,458 --> 01:17:22,958
Uh, i-initials cannot be used
without periods.

1488
01:17:23,041 --> 01:17:24,791
I've done some research,

1489
01:17:24,875 --> 01:17:27,541
and Harry S Truman
did not use a dot after his...

1490
01:17:27,625 --> 01:17:29,000
They're not called dots.

1491
01:17:30,875 --> 01:17:33,500
EE Cummings... uh, no, uh, periods.

1492
01:17:33,583 --> 01:17:35,416
And The Times uses them anyway.

1493
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:36,875
And do you know why?

1494
01:17:36,958 --> 01:17:38,791
'Cause it looks like we forgot.

1495
01:17:38,875 --> 01:17:43,041
Times style is Times style,
and you are J-period R-period Maguire.

1496
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:45,041
Period.

1497
01:17:45,125 --> 01:17:47,541
There's no periods after a last name.

1498
01:17:47,625 --> 01:17:49,958
My congratulations on your fine work.

1499
01:17:50,041 --> 01:17:52,250
You got a byline in The New York Times.

1500
01:17:58,541 --> 01:17:59,541
Anything else?

1501
01:18:01,208 --> 01:18:03,208
Oh. No, thank you.

1502
01:18:04,291 --> 01:18:06,791
- (phones ringing)
- (heavy, indistinct chatter)

1503
01:18:06,875 --> 01:18:08,875
(typewriter keys clacking)

1504
01:18:16,583 --> 01:18:18,041
(chuckles)

1505
01:18:18,125 --> 01:18:19,541
WESLEY:
Dad owns the firm.

1506
01:18:19,625 --> 01:18:21,416
Brothers are partners.

1507
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:22,750
Sooner or later, it's gonna...

1508
01:18:22,833 --> 01:18:24,750
- Lucky Sperm Club.
- Lucky Sperm Club.

1509
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:26,250
- Exactly. Yes.
- Here you go.

1510
01:18:26,333 --> 01:18:27,833
Thank you.

1511
01:18:27,916 --> 01:18:29,458
So you got promoted?

1512
01:18:29,541 --> 01:18:32,375
Oh, no, I'm promoted
when I become a full-fledged reporter

1513
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:34,125
and when my byline appears every day.

1514
01:18:34,208 --> 01:18:37,375
And you still won't have the background
Sidney's looking for

1515
01:18:37,458 --> 01:18:40,250
and you'll be mainly blossoming
as a barfly.

1516
01:18:40,333 --> 01:18:42,291
- Uh-huh, well...
- Ah, you know, genetics is tough.

1517
01:18:42,375 --> 01:18:44,000
What are you gonna do?

1518
01:18:44,083 --> 01:18:46,250
Incidentally, where is the old man?

1519
01:18:46,333 --> 01:18:48,250
- Uh, somewhere south.
- Mm.

1520
01:18:48,333 --> 01:18:50,166
You know, you're becoming
like your mother about Yale.

1521
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:51,333
Oh, yeah?

1522
01:18:51,416 --> 01:18:53,500
Yeah, you think The Times means something.

1523
01:18:53,583 --> 01:18:55,208
Yeah, because it does.
It's The New York fucking Times.

1524
01:18:55,291 --> 01:18:57,625
- No, no, it doesn't.
- Well, what does mean something?

1525
01:18:57,708 --> 01:18:59,875
A book. With a book, you'll go years

1526
01:18:59,958 --> 01:19:02,166
before you realize that
that doesn't mean anything, either.

1527
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:05,750
And I'm telling you, JR, I promise you,
whether you write at The Times,

1528
01:19:05,833 --> 01:19:08,000
whether you write this book,

1529
01:19:08,083 --> 01:19:11,250
Sidney will still never call you
out of the blue to get you back.

1530
01:19:11,333 --> 01:19:12,750
- Okay, and do you know why?
- Why?

1531
01:19:12,833 --> 01:19:15,041
Why won't Sidney ever call me,
genius who knows everything?

1532
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:18,000
Because she's dumped you like nine times.

1533
01:19:18,083 --> 01:19:21,041
- (scoffs)
- Because she doesn't love you, man.

1534
01:19:23,916 --> 01:19:27,083
Because she's getting married
on Memorial Day.

1535
01:19:27,166 --> 01:19:29,375
("Good Time Charlie's Got the Blues"
by Danny O'Keefe playing)

1536
01:19:29,458 --> 01:19:33,083
In retrospect, what you do next
is gonna be important.

1537
01:19:34,083 --> 01:19:36,208
WAITRESS:
You gentlemen ready to order?

1538
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:38,458
Four gin martinis, up with a twist.

- YOUNG JR: Hey.

1544
01:20:04,916 --> 01:20:06,666
- Wake the fuck up.
- (song stops)

1545
01:20:07,666 --> 01:20:09,916
I thought you were gonna be a writer.

1546
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,500
I am.

1547
01:20:12,583 --> 01:20:15,750
No, you're not. You're a copyboy.

1548
01:20:15,833 --> 01:20:17,750
- I write.
- A book?

1549
01:20:17,833 --> 01:20:19,916
- No.
- So you're just a fuckup.

1550
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,625
- I'm not a fuckup.
- Yeah, you are.

1551
01:20:21,708 --> 01:20:23,958
And you come from a long line of fuckups.

1552
01:20:25,041 --> 01:20:26,541
That's true.

1553
01:20:26,625 --> 01:20:28,500
You want to know what I think?

1554
01:20:29,583 --> 01:20:31,000
Probably not.

1555
01:20:31,083 --> 01:20:35,375
I think you should go back to sleep,
wake up in 20 years,

1556
01:20:35,458 --> 01:20:37,833
tell everybody how good you could've been.

1557
01:20:40,125 --> 01:20:41,750
That's what I think.

1558
01:20:43,083 --> 01:20:44,625
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you...

1559
01:20:44,708 --> 01:20:46,375
(inhales sharply)

1560
01:20:46,458 --> 01:20:48,458
(birds chirping)

1561
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:53,166
(groans softly)

1562
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:58,083
- (heavy, indistinct chatter)
- (typewriter keys clacking)

1563
01:20:58,166 --> 01:21:00,166
(phones ringing)

1564
01:21:09,708 --> 01:21:11,375
Stinky.

1565
01:21:12,416 --> 01:21:15,250
Hey. He's looking for you.

1566
01:21:16,708 --> 01:21:18,625
(sighs) This is it.

1567
01:21:18,708 --> 01:21:20,083
Lucky bastard.

1568
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,583
BRIAN: As you know,
the editors have had a chance

1569
01:21:25,666 --> 01:21:29,291
to carefully review your work,
and, um, it's terrific.

1570
01:21:29,375 --> 01:21:32,875
Truly, some of your pieces
have been outstanding.

1571
01:21:32,958 --> 01:21:36,708
Though most of them are about, uh,
people in bars on Long Island, uh...

1572
01:21:36,791 --> 01:21:38,125
(both chuckle)

1573
01:21:38,208 --> 01:21:41,291
Uh, some of your pieces have been
truly, truly outstanding.

1574
01:21:41,375 --> 01:21:45,000
Um, that's why I wish I had better news.

1575
01:21:45,083 --> 01:21:47,708
Um, as you know, um,

1576
01:21:47,791 --> 01:21:51,000
when the committee meets
to consider a trainee,

1577
01:21:51,083 --> 01:21:54,041
some editors voice support, some do not.

1578
01:21:54,125 --> 01:21:58,208
A vote's taken... and, um,
I can't tell you who voted how or why...

1579
01:21:58,291 --> 01:22:00,791
But, um, the end result is

1580
01:22:00,875 --> 01:22:04,000
I cannot offer you
a position as a reporter.

1581
01:22:08,333 --> 01:22:09,750
Thank you.

1582
01:22:09,833 --> 01:22:13,291
The feeling is that you lack,
uh, experience, you know?

1583
01:22:13,375 --> 01:22:16,208
Smaller newspaper, perhaps, you know?

1584
01:22:16,291 --> 01:22:19,958
Some place where you can, uh,
learn and grow.

1585
01:22:21,791 --> 01:22:23,500
No. Thank you.

1586
01:22:26,625 --> 01:22:28,750
- (phones ringing)
- (heavy, indistinct chatter)

1587
01:22:28,833 --> 01:22:30,833
(typewriter keys clacking)

1588
01:22:47,583 --> 01:22:49,208
It's your mom.

1589
01:22:54,083 --> 01:22:55,375
Hello?

1590
01:22:55,458 --> 01:22:57,000
CHARLIE:
Don't look at me like that.

1591
01:22:57,083 --> 01:22:58,458
They said it was minor.

1592
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:01,250
Let me tell you something.

1593
01:23:01,333 --> 01:23:04,125
It may be possible to kill me,

1594
01:23:04,208 --> 01:23:06,250
but it is not easy.

1595
01:23:07,625 --> 01:23:09,958
Okay. You sure you're all right?

1596
01:23:10,041 --> 01:23:12,333
Yeah, I'm fine.

1597
01:23:12,416 --> 01:23:15,125
Good. Be out of here in a few days.

1598
01:23:16,208 --> 01:23:18,083
(sighs)

1599
01:23:18,166 --> 01:23:20,541
What's going on? What's up?

1600
01:23:20,625 --> 01:23:22,208
Ah.

1601
01:23:22,291 --> 01:23:26,000
Well, they didn't offer me that position.

1602
01:23:27,291 --> 01:23:29,375
Pure gold.

1603
01:23:29,458 --> 01:23:31,458
All those assholes are now characters.

1604
01:23:31,541 --> 01:23:32,833
Yeah, I guess so.

1605
01:23:32,916 --> 01:23:35,083
This incident itself is dramatic.

1606
01:23:35,166 --> 01:23:36,458
You can inflate this.

1607
01:23:36,541 --> 01:23:38,041
Yeah. Okay.

1608
01:23:38,125 --> 01:23:39,333
No, I think so.

1609
01:23:39,416 --> 01:23:42,750
Maybe... maybe this is the point where

1610
01:23:42,833 --> 01:23:45,291
you tell me something really important.

1611
01:23:45,375 --> 01:23:47,000
Yeah.

1612
01:23:48,416 --> 01:23:52,791
I... To be honest, I'm not 100% sure
we should go memoir.

1613
01:23:52,875 --> 01:23:55,583
But we have to be conscious
of the trend, right?

1614
01:23:56,791 --> 01:23:59,250
However, if it is a memoir,

1615
01:23:59,333 --> 01:24:01,916
and if it's gonna have any structure...

1616
01:24:03,041 --> 01:24:04,958
...you know what you have to do.

1617
01:24:08,333 --> 01:24:11,083
He's in North Carolina doing a talk show.

1618
01:24:14,583 --> 01:24:17,125
Your father came to Manhasset once...
(clears throat)

1619
01:24:17,208 --> 01:24:20,208
Seeking rapprochements with your mother.

1620
01:24:20,291 --> 01:24:23,166
Came on the train... didn't have a car.

1621
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:25,125
Can't have any kind
of fucking rapprochements

1622
01:24:25,208 --> 01:24:27,416
with any kind of chick
if you don't have a fucking car.

1623
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,625
You know this.

1624
01:24:28,708 --> 01:24:30,666
You've told me, yes,
and the stashies in your wallet...

1625
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:32,166
Maybe in the future of transportation

1626
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:34,125
or in Holland or whatever,
things are different,

1627
01:24:34,208 --> 01:24:37,416
but in America, have a car.

1628
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:38,583
Right?

1629
01:24:39,916 --> 01:24:44,333
(clears throat) Anyway, your mother
already told him to fuck off.

1630
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:46,083
He shows up.

1631
01:24:46,166 --> 01:24:47,750
Comes into the bar.

1632
01:24:48,791 --> 01:24:52,000
Orders a well Scotch neat.

1633
01:24:52,083 --> 01:24:53,625
(chuckles softly)

1634
01:24:53,708 --> 01:24:55,708
Never order a well Scotch.

1635
01:24:55,791 --> 01:24:57,458
Never order it neat.

1636
01:24:58,583 --> 01:25:01,750
It's a signal
that you're reaching the end.

1637
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:06,500
And in his case, this was 20 years ago.

1638
01:25:09,166 --> 01:25:12,500
And then I loaned the guy
30 bucks, which...

1639
01:25:12,583 --> 01:25:14,583
I have yet to see since.

1640
01:25:16,625 --> 01:25:19,500
And over all these years,

1641
01:25:19,583 --> 01:25:24,166
all I really remember about him
is that fucking voice.

1642
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:27,708
I mean, the set of pipes.

1643
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:32,875
Uh, as I get older...

1644
01:25:34,041 --> 01:25:36,333
I wonder,

1645
01:25:36,416 --> 01:25:38,541
you know, like...

1646
01:25:38,625 --> 01:25:40,625
what was the fucking problem?

1647
01:25:42,083 --> 01:25:43,916
I mean...

1648
01:25:45,708 --> 01:25:47,166
...if...

1649
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:48,291
(sighs)

1650
01:25:50,958 --> 01:25:52,791
Do I remind you of him?

1651
01:25:55,833 --> 01:25:57,708
Lighten up on your drinking.

1652
01:26:01,208 --> 01:26:03,208
(sighs)

1653
01:26:05,833 --> 01:26:07,958
FUTURE JR:
He was right, of course.

1654
01:26:08,041 --> 01:26:12,000
First thing he did when he got out
of the hospital was light a cigarette.

1655
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:15,166
What's that line about old dogs
and new tricks?

1656
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:17,458
Speaking of old dogs...

1657
01:26:19,875 --> 01:26:21,500
It was time.

1658
01:26:24,916 --> 01:26:26,916
♪ ♪

1659
01:26:54,958 --> 01:26:57,458
Oh, come here and give your old man a hug.

1660
01:27:02,625 --> 01:27:04,250
Thanks for making the trip.

1661
01:27:05,833 --> 01:27:07,208
Yeah.

1662
01:27:10,375 --> 01:27:15,208
(sighs) So, uh, I don't know
if I told you on the phone, but, um...

1663
01:27:16,416 --> 01:27:20,041
I'm allowing myself a cocktail
from time to time.

1664
01:27:21,833 --> 01:27:23,583
- I thought you were...
- You-you want one?

1665
01:27:23,666 --> 01:27:25,041
- WAITRESS: Hey, Johnny.
- Hey.

1666
01:27:25,125 --> 01:27:27,083
- What can I get for you?
- Um...

1667
01:27:27,166 --> 01:27:29,375
Double Scotch, whatever the well is,

1668
01:27:29,458 --> 01:27:32,208
uh, rocks, splash of water, no fruit.

1669
01:27:32,291 --> 01:27:34,333
No fruit. Okay.

1670
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:36,125
- And for you?
- I'm fine.

1671
01:27:36,208 --> 01:27:37,708
Oh, come on, don't fuck with me.

1672
01:27:37,791 --> 01:27:40,166
- He's gonna have what I'm having.
- WAITRESS: You got it.

1673
01:27:42,958 --> 01:27:44,666
I make the rules.

1674
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:47,250
Unless you can take me.

1675
01:27:51,041 --> 01:27:52,708
You want to take me on?

1676
01:27:55,083 --> 01:27:58,208
For being a shitty father,
I'll give you the first shot.

1677
01:27:58,291 --> 01:27:59,916
(chuckles softly)

1678
01:28:01,125 --> 01:28:02,625
I think I'm okay.

1679
01:28:02,708 --> 01:28:04,166
Yeah.

1680
01:28:05,458 --> 01:28:08,625
I'm letting myself have a cocktail
from time to time.

1681
01:28:09,666 --> 01:28:11,625
I don't think I told you over the phone

1682
01:28:11,708 --> 01:28:15,833
that I was letting myself have a cocktail
from time to time, huh?

1683
01:28:15,916 --> 01:28:20,833
See, I realized that, um,
I'm not an alcoholic, so...

1684
01:28:20,916 --> 01:28:22,625
Yeah.

1685
01:28:22,708 --> 01:28:24,000
It's all good.

1686
01:28:24,083 --> 01:28:26,208
You know, when the mood strikes me,

1687
01:28:26,291 --> 01:28:28,625
I can enjoy a cocktail.

1688
01:28:28,708 --> 01:28:32,083
And you can enjoy a cocktail
with your old man.

1689
01:28:32,166 --> 01:28:34,083
WAITRESS:
Here we go.

1690
01:28:34,166 --> 01:28:35,958
(The Voice clears throat)

1691
01:28:37,041 --> 01:28:38,750
THE VOICE:
Thank you.

1692
01:28:46,208 --> 01:28:50,041
Okay, so what are you doing?

1693
01:28:51,166 --> 01:28:53,083
I'm a writer.

1694
01:28:53,166 --> 01:28:55,083
I have a job at The Times.

1695
01:29:00,458 --> 01:29:03,541
And, uh, how's your mother?

1696
01:29:03,625 --> 01:29:05,875
She's good.

1697
01:29:05,958 --> 01:29:07,666
Yeah?

1698
01:29:11,583 --> 01:29:13,958
We're gonna go, uh, have dinner.

1699
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,500
At Kathy's.

1700
01:29:18,041 --> 01:29:20,083
She's the new poontang. (chuckles)

1701
01:29:22,083 --> 01:29:23,875
(The Voice clears throat)

1702
01:29:25,083 --> 01:29:27,333
So... (sighs)

1703
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:29,916
Let's go.

1704
01:29:45,666 --> 01:29:47,666
(dog barking in distance)

1705
01:29:56,875 --> 01:29:58,500
(sighs)

1706
01:30:14,291 --> 01:30:15,791
THE VOICE:
Hey.

1707
01:30:18,958 --> 01:30:22,083
Well, I see y'all started
the party without me.

1708
01:30:22,166 --> 01:30:25,416
The party started
a long time before I met you.

1709
01:30:26,666 --> 01:30:30,125
This is my son, JR.

1710
01:30:31,125 --> 01:30:33,541
What's the JR stand for?

1711
01:30:34,625 --> 01:30:35,958
Junior.

1712
01:30:36,958 --> 01:30:39,416
Very pleased to meet you, JR.

1713
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,250
Nice to meet you.

1714
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:47,166
THE VOICE:
What's for supper?

1715
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:49,291
KATHY: I cooked a chicken,
got some vegetables.

1716
01:30:49,375 --> 01:30:50,833
What time do you want to eat?

1717
01:30:50,916 --> 01:30:53,375
THE VOICE:
Well, we're hungry now.

1718
01:30:53,458 --> 01:30:55,833
What about that one?

1719
01:30:55,916 --> 01:30:57,375
Hmm...

1720
01:30:57,458 --> 01:31:00,333
- That is... Right here?
- Yeah, one... the piece has to go here.

1721
01:31:00,416 --> 01:31:03,333
- This piece has to go here.
- JR: Nice.

1722
01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:05,583
What do you do with these
after you're done?

1723
01:31:07,208 --> 01:31:09,291
Mama shellacs 'em and puts 'em up.

1724
01:31:15,458 --> 01:31:18,208
- That's Venice.
- I know.

1725
01:31:19,458 --> 01:31:21,416
Have you ever been there?

1726
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:22,916
Not yet.

1727
01:31:24,041 --> 01:31:26,041
How do you get to go places?

1728
01:31:29,041 --> 01:31:30,458
