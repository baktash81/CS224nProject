Boat shot from under
him in the Channel.

22

Oh, he's been in
hospital for the last month.

00:04:52,594 --> 00:04:54,128
He seems quite well now, sir.

24

What's this? He's American.

English mother, sir.

26
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:03,538
He volunteered September '39.

27
00:05:03,572 --> 00:05:05,106
He's been with us
two and a half years.

28
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,875
Might be something in him then.

29
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:10,344
Is he here? He's outside, sir.

30
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:11,480
Have him sent in.

will give you the overall picture.

Rommel's got the Eighth

Almost to the Suez Canal.

and from the north through
Russia and the Caucasus,

50
00:06:26,855 --> 00:06:28,723
They'll have the whole
Mediterranean sewn up.

51
00:06:28,757 --> 00:06:30,992
But Malta's a dagger
at Rommel's throat.

52
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,128
If Malta goes, so does Egypt.

53
00:06:35,564 --> 00:06:36,965
And if Egypt goes...

54
00:06:40,301 --> 00:06:43,872
Malta's the hinge on
which the war can turn.

55
00:06:43,905 --> 00:06:46,775
And it'll be your job to
see that it turns our way.

56
00:06:48,877 --> 00:06:50,444
Now you understand
that, Jeffords.

57
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:53,548
This is not just a routine
probing operation. It's big!

58
00:06:57,051 --> 00:07:00,054
- Can you tell me anything about it, sir?
- No.

00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:02,356
You might get yourself
captured en route.

60
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:06,327
Well, I think that's
all. Any questions?

61
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,697
- Just one request.
- What is it?

62
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,399
I'd like to have my old chief
assigned to the operation.

63
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:14,869
- Who is he?
- Chief Petty Officer Adam Ben Yacov.

64
00:07:14,903 --> 00:07:16,470

00:07:25,246 --> 00:07:27,749
Oh, no. There's one other thing.

00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:29,684
You'll be reporting to
Commander Ashurst.

00:07:35,924 --> 00:07:37,592
- Ashurst?
- Yes.

00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:41,930
Give him my regards, will you?

76
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:44,065
Yes, sir, I'll do that.

77
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:45,967
- Well, good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

drop you in the drink.

attention, please?

are only a few minutes
flying time from Malta.

83
00:08:08,757 --> 00:08:12,727

the airfield when we touch down.

be thrown open.

as fast as you can

88
00:08:22,937 --> 00:08:26,340
and make for the blast
shelters alongside the runway.

89
00:08:26,374 --> 00:08:28,943
Remain there
until the all clear.

90
00:08:28,977 --> 00:08:30,244
One further matter.

91
00:08:30,278 --> 00:08:34,048
The motors will not be stopped
while we are on the ground.

92
00:08:34,082 --> 00:08:36,317
Try to avoid running
into the propellers.

93
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,219

after you've gone.

done to deserve this.

105
00:09:46,387 --> 00:09:48,823
A castle under siege.

Nothing much can get in.
Nothing much can get out.

bother to send more men in

00:10:01,736 --> 00:10:04,205

operational orders for me, sir.

- No, they didn't.

117
00:10:45,313 --> 00:10:46,815
What is it?

118
00:10:46,848 --> 00:10:49,683
It was an Italian
submarine base in Sicily.

119
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:52,220
Then the Germans took it over.

120
00:10:52,253 --> 00:10:54,823
Now they're using
the sub pens to store...

121
00:10:54,856 --> 00:10:55,924
Glider bombs?

122
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:58,492
New weapons.

123
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:01,395
They're using them
against our Convoys.

124
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:05,266
Their planes drop
them at a distance,

125
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:07,735
They glide in radio
controlled to the target.

126
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:10,304
And they're extremely accurate.

127
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:14,375
Only last week 50
of our ships set out.

128
00:11:14,976 --> 00:11:16,410
Three made it.

129
00:11:16,444 --> 00:11:18,146
Two of those sank in the harbor.

130
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,350
We're supposed to be
hitting Rommel's line of supply.

131

holding on ourselves.

132

must knock out that base.

There's a solid mountain of
rock sitting on top of those pens.

137
00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:40,501
They've neither the planes
nor the payload to touch it.

138
00:11:41,402 --> 00:11:43,037
It's impregnable.

139
00:11:43,071 --> 00:11:45,473
So now they want
MTBs to do the job.

140
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:51,212
Well, these orders tell me what to do,
where to do it. They don't tell me how.

How is your problem.

"Approach and method to be at the
discretion of the tactical commander."

143
00:11:57,351 --> 00:12:01,455
They either have a very high opinion of you
or you've made a damned nuisance of yourself.

144
00:12:01,489 --> 00:12:04,092
What did you do? Spill a
bowl of soup on an Admiral?

145
00:12:08,496 --> 00:12:10,131
Well, uh,

146
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:11,565
Come and meet your crews.

147
00:12:12,867 --> 00:12:15,403
I gather you didn't
volunteer for this show.

148
00:12:16,337 --> 00:12:17,705
Who volunteers?

149
00:12:24,212 --> 00:12:26,080
No sign of Willy yet? No, sir.

150
00:12:27,982 --> 00:12:29,350
Who's Willy?

151
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:31,819
10:00 Willy. He's
a Messerschmitt.

152
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:34,956
He, uh, sometimes comes
over for a bit of fun about 10:00.

153
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:36,690
He'll come out of the sun.

154
00:12:36,724 --> 00:12:38,492
Have to get used to him.

155
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:40,128
Jerry uses us
for target practice.

156
00:12:40,161 --> 00:12:42,796
In fact, we're the
proverbial sitting duck.

157
00:12:43,898 --> 00:12:46,034
By the way, I bring
regards from your father.

158
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,369
Saw the old man, did you?

159
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:50,638
Quite a reputation.
Something to live up to.

160
00:12:57,641 --> 00:12:59,732
I just kicked a chief petty
officer off my boat, sir.

161
00:12:59,757 --> 00:13:02,677
He seems to be carrying out some
sort of general inspection and inventory.

162
00:13:02,701 --> 00:13:04,163
I don't know who the hell he is.

163
00:13:04,252 --> 00:13:05,586
That's probably my chief.

164
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:08,322
I asked him to look things
over, give me his first impression.

165
00:13:08,356 --> 00:13:12,526
Barlow, this is Lieutenant Commander
Jeffords. He's taking over the flotilla.

166
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,362
How do you do?
How do you do, sir?

167
00:13:14,395 --> 00:13:16,330
I'm looking forward
to serving under you.

168
00:13:16,364 --> 00:13:19,400
However, I trust the established
chain of command will still prevail.

169
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:22,836
I'm sure it will, Lieutenant. My
chief's always a bit over enthusiastic.

170
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,638
He was downright
insubordinate, sir.

171
00:13:24,672 --> 00:13:26,640
You'll like him better
in a fight, Lieutenant.

172
00:13:26,674 --> 00:13:29,810
Barlow, have the ship's company
stand by to meet the new commander.

173
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:30,945
Aye-aye, sir.

174
00:13:33,781 --> 00:13:36,684
Young Barlow was expecting
to take command of the flotilla.

175
00:13:37,351 --> 00:13:38,752
Was he?

176
00:13:38,786 --> 00:13:40,688

194
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,439
How long have you
been out here, Lieutenant?

195
00:14:47,463 --> 00:14:49,757

Dismiss!

212
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:12,140
Gentlemen, I know some
of what you've been through.

213
00:16:12,173 --> 00:16:14,342
I know it's not easy
to carry on short of

00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:18,446

replacement personnel.

215
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:20,839
But now that we've been
selected for this special operation,

216
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:23,517
I'm going to have to demand
an even greater effort from you.

217
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,752
Operation, sir?

218
00:16:24,785 --> 00:16:26,920
You'll hear all about that
when you're ready to go.

219
00:16:26,954 --> 00:16:29,657
Ready in fighting ability
and aggressive action.

220
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,090
- Are you suggesting...
- I'm suggesting nothing, Mr. Barlow.

221
00:16:32,114 --> 00:16:34,395
I'm simply telling
you what to expect.

222
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:37,798
This operation requires performances
beyond anything you've ever known.

223
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:42,370
What about spare parts, sir?

224
00:16:42,403 --> 00:16:44,538
The ship carrying
our supplies was sunk.

225
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:46,874
Well, there are two boats
at the bottom of the harbor.

226
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:48,427
Strip those boats of
everything useable

227
00:16:48,451 --> 00:16:50,653
and you'll have all the
spare parts you need.

228
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:53,046
All right,
gentlemen, that's all.

229
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:09,029
Sounded to me as if you were trying to
convince yourself the operation has a chance.

230
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:10,531
Is there an alternative?

231
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:29,250
Do you have a dry cigarette?

232
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,254
Sure.

233
00:17:34,622 --> 00:17:36,257

Just came in yesterday.

241
00:17:56,977 --> 00:18:00,281

Haven't seen these in months.

00:29:49,522 --> 00:29:53,226
I'm still waiting, Jeffords. I'm still
waiting for a coherent explanation

357
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,861
as to why you didn't
give me your report.

358
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:58,932
I told you, sir, I was planning
to do that in the morning.

359
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:02,502
Mr. Jeffords, on this base, in this
command, you'll go by the book

360
00:30:02,535 --> 00:30:04,504
or so help me, I'll
slam it shut on you.

361
00:30:05,505 --> 00:30:07,340
Understood?

362
00:30:07,374 --> 00:30:09,309
I'll try to keep
that in mind, sir.

363
00:30:11,744 --> 00:30:14,081
Now, your report.

364
00:30:16,516 --> 00:30:18,251
I want Barlow replaced.

365
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:23,456
He told me he delayed a run
in order to pick up survivors.

366
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,758
Personally, I don't think
that a reason to replace him.

367
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,394
No, I do, sir.

368
00:30:27,427 --> 00:30:31,231
Men killed and wounded, and we let
12,000 tons of German shipping escape

369
00:30:31,264 --> 00:30:34,744
because of a boat captain who still hasn't
learned the most elementary principle of war,

370
00:30:34,768 --> 00:30:36,303
the objective first.

371
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:39,806
Barlow was right in
one respect, morale.

372
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,084
If you leave men
swimming in the sea,

373
00:30:41,108 --> 00:30:42,909
No one's going to be
happy riding with you.

374
00:30:42,942 --> 00:30:44,222
I don't expect them to be happy.

375
00:30:44,246 --> 00:30:46,013
I expect them to obey orders.

376
00:30:46,046 --> 00:30:47,326
Was the signal sent by wireless?

377
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,116
In clear.

378
00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:50,669
Supposing the
wireless didn't function?

379
00:30:50,693 --> 00:30:53,129
MTB operations rule
one, never turn back.

380
00:30:55,322 --> 00:30:57,424
You're a cold-blooded
bastard, Jeffords.

381
00:30:57,457 --> 00:31:00,060
No, no, I'm what I've been made,

382
00:31:00,093 --> 00:31:02,862
A boat commander
sent on a lunatic mission

383
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:06,033
with crews who haven't been
given a chance to volunteer.

384
00:31:06,066 --> 00:31:09,436
No, I'm stuck with them just like
they're stuck with me, but Barlow's out.

385
00:31:09,469 --> 00:31:13,106
He's a good man. Why not
give him another chance?

386
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:16,243
Commander, nine days
from now, I've got a job to do.

387
00:31:16,276 --> 00:31:19,246
Barlow isn't the kind
of officer I can do it with.

388
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,923
The men I need are
going to have to hit Augusta

389
00:31:20,947 --> 00:31:22,382
without thought,
without hesitation,

390
00:31:22,415 --> 00:31:23,483
without stopping to wonder

391
00:31:23,516 --> 00:31:25,318
who's going to live
or who's going to die.

392
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:27,112
The men I want are
going to know they're dead

393
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:29,706
the minute we enter that harbor.

394
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,025
All right, Barlow's out.

395
00:31:39,166 --> 00:31:40,700
There's one more thing,

396
00:31:41,534 --> 00:31:43,070
I'll have to see Augusta.

397
00:31:44,637 --> 00:31:46,606
I might arrange an
aerial reconnaissance.

398
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:48,941
No, that won't do it.
I have to go ashore.

399
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:53,613
That's been tried. Six months
ago by Naval Intelligence.

400
00:31:54,714 --> 00:31:56,083
We lost five agents.

401
00:31:56,116 --> 00:31:58,351
(SIGHS) Then we'll just have
to try it again, Commander.

402
00:31:58,385 --> 00:32:00,387
I've got to lead a
flotilla in there at night!

403
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,420
I have to know their exact gun positions,
the location of the mine channels.

404
00:32:03,444 --> 00:32:05,525
Photographs won't give me that.

405
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:07,860
You said yourself this
was a lunatic mission.

406
00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:09,962
This is madness.

407
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:12,832
Maybe. Anyway, I'd appreciate it

408
00:32:12,865 --> 00:32:15,935
if you'd set this in motion
through proper channels.

409
00:32:15,968 --> 00:32:17,404
(SIGHS)

410
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:20,273
Now with your permission,
sir, I'd like to get some sleep.

411
00:32:21,841 --> 00:32:23,443
Carry on, Jeffords.

412
00:32:31,448 --> 00:32:32,928
You can tell Lieutenant
Barlow for me.

413
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:35,222
As far as I'm concerned,
I did him a favor.

414
00:32:48,135 --> 00:32:50,137
Ship's company, ho!

415
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:54,006
Stand the men at ease.

416
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,209
Ship's company, stand at ease!

417
00:32:56,909 --> 00:32:58,311
Stand easy.

418
00:32:58,345 --> 00:33:00,380
(BELL RINGS)

419
00:33:00,413 --> 00:33:05,152
And that, gentlemen, is the last time
you'll be at ease for the next nine days.

420
00:33:06,386 --> 00:33:08,855
On that, you have my guarantee.

421
00:33:08,888 --> 00:33:11,891
All right. Now that we've met

422
00:33:11,924 --> 00:33:14,894
and grown to love each
other, I'll lay it onto you directly.

423
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:22,335
Sometime, gentlemen,
in the next nine days,

424
00:33:24,371 --> 00:33:27,073
we're all going to be
taking a little cruise together.

425
00:33:29,276 --> 00:33:31,444
Where we're going
and why is top secret.

426
00:33:33,246 --> 00:33:35,882
For the moment, all
you need to know is

427
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:39,686
the mission is of
supreme importance.

428
00:33:41,254 --> 00:33:45,292
And nothing less than complete
success will be acceptable.

429
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:51,664
Now, on the basis of what
I saw on our last operation,

430
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:58,004
Our chances of survival
on this one are nil.

431
00:34:01,808 --> 00:34:04,377
Now, since I don't
like committing suicide,

432
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:10,517
you're going to spend every moment
you're not out on a combat mission

433
00:34:11,851 --> 00:34:13,220
in training.

434
00:34:14,421 --> 00:34:18,658
You'll work until this
flotilla satisfies me

435
00:34:20,126 --> 00:34:22,962
that it is capable
in every respect

436
00:34:24,564 --> 00:34:28,067
of carrying out the job
we were selected for.

437
00:34:28,835 --> 00:34:30,237
Are there any questions?

438
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:38,010
Good, then I suggest
we get started now.

439
00:34:38,044 --> 00:34:39,946
(MACHINE GUN FIRING)

440
00:34:45,151 --> 00:34:48,321
Lead the boat. No, no,
no. Lead the boat! Lead it!

441
00:35:05,538 --> 00:35:08,174
I want them all out here
at 0600 at the mooring.

442
00:35:08,207 --> 00:35:09,942
(BLOWS WHISTLE)

443
00:35:10,977 --> 00:35:13,980
Man your positions!
Come on, move it!

444
00:35:15,181 --> 00:35:17,384
MAN 1: Aye, sir! MAN 2: Move it!

445
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:19,719
2760 too slow leaving port.

446
00:35:24,391 --> 00:35:25,958
How are they shaping up?

447
00:35:25,992 --> 00:35:27,394
They're good men, but they...

448
00:35:27,427 --> 00:35:29,329
But they don't like the
training schedule, hmm?

449
00:35:29,362 --> 00:35:32,131
More than that. They
hate your guts, sir.

450
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:36,869
Well, that's straight
to the point anyway.

451
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,071
Why?

452
00:35:39,105 --> 00:35:42,642
They think Lieutenant Barlow
was right and you were wrong.

453
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:46,679
What do you think?

454
00:35:48,214 --> 00:35:50,850
I think if a man has
something to fight for,

455
00:35:50,883 --> 00:35:52,352
He has something to live for.

456
00:35:53,753 --> 00:35:56,589
In other words, the
man before the mission?

457
00:35:56,623 --> 00:35:59,692
Well, it depends what each
man sees as his mission.

458
00:36:02,895 --> 00:36:04,096
What's yours?

459
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:07,166
I fight to make
way for what I want.

460
00:36:07,934 --> 00:36:09,536
To live in peace.

461
00:36:10,303 --> 00:36:12,339
I see no difference between us.

462
00:36:12,372 --> 00:36:15,241
There wasn't, not
in the beginning.

463
00:36:16,443 --> 00:36:17,944
There is now.

464
00:36:19,446 --> 00:36:21,748
You see, there are
travelers and the hunters.

465
00:36:22,248 --> 00:36:23,616
How's that?

466
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:26,386
If a traveler has to pass
through a jungle on his way home,

467
00:36:26,419 --> 00:36:29,356
And a wild animal
stands in his way,

468
00:36:30,056 --> 00:36:31,324
He kills it.

469
00:36:32,725 --> 00:36:34,327
And the hunter.

470
00:36:35,662 --> 00:36:37,364
What does he do?

471
00:36:37,397 --> 00:36:41,267
He goes into the
jungle for the killing,

472
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,835
And he's going nowhere.

473
00:36:46,072 --> 00:36:48,174
And I'm the hunter, is that it?

474
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:53,112
That's a question you
have to ask yourself.

475
00:37:41,561 --> 00:37:43,963
I told you it was
a small island.

476
00:37:48,067 --> 00:37:49,702
Hello, stranger.

477
00:37:49,736 --> 00:37:51,070
Hello, Commander.

478
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:54,807
Can I freshen your drink?

479
00:37:55,374 --> 00:37:56,976
Yeah, sure,

480
00:37:58,377 --> 00:38:00,146
But not here.

481
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:01,514
Somewhere else.

482
00:38:02,415 --> 00:38:03,616
Anyplace, you name it.

483
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,719
Anywhere, you say?
London, New York, Rio...

484
00:38:06,753 --> 00:38:08,020
No.

485
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:10,523
No, I'm serious.

486
00:38:10,557 --> 00:38:11,724
Don't be.

487
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:15,728
For all you know, I
could be quite vulnerable.

488
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:19,365
If not unavailable.

489
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:26,639
Look, if it'll help you
change your mind,

490
00:38:26,673 --> 00:38:28,908
I'll settle for
just a quiet walk.

491
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:33,312
I am sorry, but it's
really quite impossible.

492
00:38:33,345 --> 00:38:34,481
Is it?

493
00:38:34,514 --> 00:38:36,949
I see you've met
my wife, Jeffords.

494
00:38:39,886 --> 00:38:41,488
Please excuse me.

495
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:51,864
The, uh, Admiral's interested in
your idea for a land reconnaissance.

496
00:38:51,898 --> 00:38:53,766
It's on.

497
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,111
Seems there's an agent who's
got hold of an Italian naval officer

498
00:38:56,135 --> 00:38:58,175
who wants to talk to us. I
don't know what he wants,

499
00:38:58,209 --> 00:38:59,729
but since he was
Commandant of Augusta,

500
00:38:59,753 --> 00:39:01,884
he may be able to help
get you into the base.

501
00:39:03,075 --> 00:39:07,313
I suppose it's occurred to
you, sir, that this may be a trap?

502
00:39:07,346 --> 00:39:10,282
Yes, but... But it's a
chance we can't ignore.

503
00:39:12,051 --> 00:39:13,820
Our rendezvous has been fixed.

504
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:17,356
Here are your sealed
orders. You slip at 2300.

505
00:39:21,127 --> 00:39:23,930
Well, let's have a drink
before you go. Hmm?

506
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:34,707
You tell Barlow
about my decision?

507
00:39:34,741 --> 00:39:37,544
I did. I think you
ought to know that

508
00:39:37,577 --> 00:39:40,813
Barlow admitted he received
your order and disobeyed it.

509
00:39:42,649 --> 00:39:44,684
Well, anything else before I go?

510
00:39:45,752 --> 00:39:48,154
Just the good wishes of us all.

511
00:40:11,844 --> 00:40:13,279
BARLOW: Sir?

512
00:40:16,549 --> 00:40:18,651
Yes, Barlow?

513
00:40:18,685 --> 00:40:22,254
I want to apologize for what
happened the other night,

514
00:40:22,288 --> 00:40:25,391
And if I could have another
chance of coming with you again, sir.

515
00:40:30,563 --> 00:40:32,799
I need a captain for a
special mission tonight.

516
00:40:32,832 --> 00:40:34,233
Are you on?

517
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:36,468
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

518
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:39,238
All right then, Mr. Barlow,

519
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:41,007
Meet me on the dock, 2300 hours.

520
00:40:59,025 --> 00:41:00,627
Cut wing engines.

521
00:41:18,144 --> 00:41:20,146
(GREETS IN ITALIAN)

522
00:41:20,179 --> 00:41:21,781
You like opera, signore?

523
00:41:21,814 --> 00:41:23,415
I like Traviata.

524
00:41:23,449 --> 00:41:26,452
Me, I like Don Giovanni.

525
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:29,121
All right, that's it. Stay
out of sight until sundown.

526
00:41:35,762 --> 00:41:41,400
Momento. I got a contract to

think very much of the plan, sir.

705
01:08:44,121 --> 01:08:46,424
Plan? What plan?

706
01:08:47,858 --> 01:08:49,727
That is a scheme for disaster.

707
01:08:51,896 --> 01:08:55,533
Captured E-boat stealing
into enemy harbor.

708
01:08:55,566 --> 01:08:59,169
A flotilla of MTBs casually thrown
away in a diversionary action.

709
01:09:00,305 --> 01:09:02,907
Underwater swimmers.

710
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:06,377
As a matter of interest, just
where do they come from?

711
01:09:06,411 --> 01:09:09,414
Myself, the two CBOs,
Yacov and Stanhope.

712
01:09:09,447 --> 01:09:10,915
We've all had
the basic training.

713
01:09:13,117 --> 01:09:15,152
I can't possibly
allow you to proceed.

714
01:09:15,786 --> 01:09:16,954
I think the whole scheme...

715
01:09:16,987 --> 01:09:19,067
I really don't give a damn
what you think, Commander.

716
01:09:19,101 --> 01:09:21,421
I didn't come here to ask
your permission. I don't need it.

717
01:09:21,445 --> 01:09:24,395
Mr. Jeffords, I'm your
commanding officer.

718
01:09:24,429 --> 01:09:25,530
That's right, sir.

719
01:09:25,563 --> 01:09:27,031
In everything
except the detailed

720
01:09:27,064 --> 01:09:28,464
planning for the
assault on Augusta.

721
01:09:28,488 --> 01:09:30,134
My authority for
that's the Admiralty.

722
01:09:30,167 --> 01:09:32,169
That does not justify
insubordination.

723
01:09:34,036 --> 01:09:35,316
If you persist in this attitude,

724
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:37,274
I shall take it up
with the Admiral.

725
01:09:37,308 --> 01:09:39,108
You can take it up with
who the hell you like.

726
01:09:39,132 --> 01:09:41,668
All I want from you is authority
to draw those special stores.

727
01:09:50,855 --> 01:09:51,856
You don't get it.

728
01:09:52,823 --> 01:09:55,826
What is it with you, Commander?

729
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:59,330
I mean, where do you get
off with these obstructions?

730
01:09:59,364 --> 01:10:01,666
I've worked out a plan
which is at least feasible.

731
01:10:01,699 --> 01:10:02,939
And it's halfway to completion.

732
01:10:02,963 --> 01:10:03,901
Halfway to hell.

733
01:10:03,934 --> 01:10:05,336
No one's asking you to go.

734
01:10:08,005 --> 01:10:09,206
Mr. Jeffords...

735
01:10:10,875 --> 01:10:14,779
I could have you placed under
arrest for what you've said here today.

736
01:10:14,812 --> 01:10:16,881
Now, you go ahead.

737
01:10:16,914 --> 01:10:20,585
Go ahead, Commander. Because that's
the only way you're going to stop me.

738
01:10:43,574 --> 01:10:45,410
You asked to see me,
sir? Ah, yes, Wallace.

739
01:10:46,276 --> 01:10:47,878
I need your help.

740
01:10:47,912 --> 01:10:50,314
I want you to try and
send a priority radio signal.

741
01:10:50,347 --> 01:10:51,949
Supposedly coming
from the E-boat.

742
01:10:51,982 --> 01:10:53,662
So it sounds as if it's
under heavy attack.

743
01:10:53,686 --> 01:10:55,486
Officers wounded,
boat in trouble.

744
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,122
I want Jerry to think he knows
why the boat hasn't come back.

745
01:10:58,155 --> 01:11:00,475
That way he might be more
sympathetic when it does show up.

746
01:11:00,499 --> 01:11:01,838
Yes, I think we
can do that, sir.

747
01:11:01,871 --> 01:11:03,694
Ah, good, good.
As soon as you can.

748
01:11:03,728 --> 01:11:05,329
These are the
documents from the boat.

749
01:11:05,362 --> 01:11:07,665
Right. I'll let you
know how we get on.

750
01:11:41,098 --> 01:11:43,233
Alison.

751
01:11:43,267 --> 01:11:46,537
Those things I said to
you the other evening.

752
01:11:48,839 --> 01:11:50,340
They were very unfair.

753
01:11:52,943 --> 01:11:54,278
I realize that now.

754
01:11:58,583 --> 01:11:59,917
I came to apologize.

755
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:04,789
Some of what you said is true.

756
01:12:05,523 --> 01:12:06,757
Now.

757
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:12,029
It's too late, Roger.

758
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:27,311
I envy men like Jeffords.

759
01:12:29,213 --> 01:12:30,781
He's a man prepared to kill.

760
01:12:32,517 --> 01:12:33,951
Prepared to die.

761
01:12:35,686 --> 01:12:37,488
He enjoys this
war, I'm certain of it.

762
01:12:41,025 --> 01:12:42,693
Perhaps he's just
a man who wants

763
01:12:42,727 --> 01:12:44,995
to get it over with
as quickly as possible.

764
01:12:49,233 --> 01:12:50,801
You...

765
01:12:52,436 --> 01:12:53,938
You've been seeing him?

766
01:13:00,377 --> 01:13:01,879
You sent me away, Roger.

767
01:13:03,681 --> 01:13:04,949
Does he mean anything to you?

768
01:13:10,054 --> 01:13:11,488
I don't know.

769
01:13:18,328 --> 01:13:19,564
Alison...

770
01:13:20,898 --> 01:13:22,332
Don't let's blame each other.

771
01:13:31,876 --> 01:13:33,210
Good night.

772
01:13:40,618 --> 01:13:41,919
(DOOR CLOSING)

773
01:13:49,627 --> 01:13:50,661
(SOBBING)

774
01:14:06,143 --> 01:14:07,645
What the devil is going on?

775
01:14:08,946 --> 01:14:11,215
Lt. Commander
Jeffords' orders, sir.

776
01:14:11,248 --> 01:14:13,618
He wants the E-boat
to look nicely shot up.

777
01:14:18,623 --> 01:14:21,491
And where is our
ingenious Jeffords?

778
01:14:21,525 --> 01:14:22,860
Bottom of the harbor, sir.

779
01:14:52,556 --> 01:14:54,491
Uh, Jeffords, I, um,

780
01:14:54,524 --> 01:14:57,327
Understand you're holding
a briefing for all COs at 1100.

781
01:14:57,795 --> 01:14:59,463
That's right.

782
01:14:59,496 --> 01:15:01,498
I trust my presence
won't disturb you.

783
01:15:10,474 --> 01:15:14,211
JEFFORDS: The E-boat will
lead the approach to Augusta.

784
01:15:14,244 --> 01:15:17,882
All other boats will maintain
station 200 yards astern.

785
01:15:17,915 --> 01:15:20,117
Now, we think
through radio deception

786
01:15:20,150 --> 01:15:22,911
that we've prepared the Germans
for the idea that one of their E-boats

787
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:24,822
was heavily engaged and damaged.

788
01:15:24,855 --> 01:15:26,824
So we're hoping
they'll pass us through.

789
01:15:26,857 --> 01:15:30,160
The E-boat's job is to get
the defensive boom open,

790
01:15:30,194 --> 01:15:33,497
And keep it open long enough
for the rest of you to crash in.

791
01:15:34,564 --> 01:15:37,668
How long do you estimate
the deception will last?

792
01:15:37,702 --> 01:15:41,839
Long enough. After that, they'll
have other things on their minds.

793
01:15:41,872 --> 01:15:45,710
Now, once inside the harbor, the
E-boat will head to the submarine pens,

794
01:15:45,743 --> 01:15:47,511
And drop the landing
party over the side.

795
01:15:47,544 --> 01:15:50,080
While the flotilla creates
havoc in the anchorage?

796
01:15:50,114 --> 01:15:51,481
Exactly.

797
01:15:51,515 --> 01:15:54,584
At what point do the boat captains
make the decision to withdraw?

798
01:15:54,618 --> 01:15:57,722
Well, a red flare will signal the
landing party's off the E-boat.

799
01:15:57,755 --> 01:16:00,090
From that moment,
we'll need five minutes.

800
01:16:00,124 --> 01:16:02,793
So we expect you to create
as much havoc as possible.

801
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:05,162
Then get the hell out.

802
01:16:05,195 --> 01:16:07,932
And what about the shore party?

803
01:16:07,965 --> 01:16:10,935
Well, the two CPOs
and myself know the risk.

804
01:16:10,968 --> 01:16:12,837
We'll get out the
best way we can.

805
01:16:12,870 --> 01:16:17,975
I repeat, gentlemen, once the landing
party is inside the submarine pens,

806
01:16:18,008 --> 01:16:19,543
Your part of this
mission is over.

807
01:16:19,576 --> 01:16:20,878
Get in, do your job and get out.

808
01:16:20,911 --> 01:16:22,679
No waiting. No turning back.

809
01:16:22,713 --> 01:16:23,914
Is that understood?

810
01:16:25,015 --> 01:16:27,451
All right. Synchronize watches.

811
01:16:30,921 --> 01:16:33,157
It is 1302...

812
01:16:35,192 --> 01:16:36,827
Now.

813
01:16:36,861 --> 01:16:40,765
One more thing. I'll need someone
to lead the diversionary action.

814
01:16:41,698 --> 01:16:44,401
Command the E-boat.

815
01:16:44,434 --> 01:16:46,871
For once I have the opportunity
of calling for a volunteer.

816
01:16:46,904 --> 01:16:47,905
I'll take her, Jeffords.

817
01:16:53,510 --> 01:16:54,790
All right, Commander. Thank you.

818
01:16:56,046 --> 01:16:57,915
All right,
gentlemen, that's all.

819
01:16:57,948 --> 01:17:00,050
We slip this evening at 1800.

820
01:17:00,517 --> 01:17:01,952
And good luck.

821
01:17:12,863 --> 01:17:14,464
Why the change of mind?

822
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:18,168
If you're about to destroy
my entire command,

823
01:17:18,202 --> 01:17:20,137
I might as well
be there to see it.

824
01:17:21,671 --> 01:17:23,507
I'm glad to have you along, sir.

I'd better get ready. Good luck.

There's just one
thing. What's that?

831
01:19:31,101 --> 01:19:33,870
If we all get killed,
don't say I told you so.

832
01:19:36,306 --> 01:19:37,741
That's a promise.

834
01:20:44,074 --> 01:20:45,809
