1
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,156
Show me what you got!

2
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,913
Come on, guys!
I can do this.

3
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,878
Ha-ha, didn't hurt!

4
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,435
Ha-ha!
You got nothin' on me, Bones!

5
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,880
Hey! I'm the best!

6
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,554
I'm goin' get ya now!

7
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,115
All right,
let's do this thing.

8
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,594
You can't catch me!

9
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,080
Yeah, run away!

10
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,870
Whoa!

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,276
Get outta my way!
Watch it!

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,229
Careful.

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,990
That was close.

14
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,674
Is that all you got?

15
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,877
Hi, buddy.
I told you I'd be back.

16
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,273
Wow.

17
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,280
- The truck!
- Whoo-hoo!

18
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,392
Out of my way, losers!
Hey!

19
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,514
- Guys, check it out.
- Wow, cool!

20
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,353
Yes! The winner's truck.

21
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,795
It's happening today?

22
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,360
What's happening today?
Ugh.

23
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,591
Don't you know anything,
Ferdinand?

24
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,750
If that truck's here,

25
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,559
it means the matador's
gonna pick a bull.

26
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,154
Who do you think
he's gonna pick?

27
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,391
Duh, my dad.

28
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,439
And when my horns come in,
it'll be my turn.

29
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,550
<i>People will come
from all over Spain</i>

30
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,236
<i>just to see me,
the great Valiente!</i>

31
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,632
<i>The fiercest bull of all time.</i>

32
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,792
<i>I'll take him down big time.</i>

33
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,520
<i>Man versus bull.</i>

34
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,396
<i>Will it be pretty? No.</i>

35
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,359
<i>Will it be awesome? Heck yeah!</i>

36
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,192
<i>The crowd will go nuts,
making me a champ.</i>

37
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,152
I'll spend the rest of my days
living like a king.

38
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,152
Dream on, Valiente.

39
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,312
I'm the one
who's getting selected.

40
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,120
I'm already
working on my victory smile.

41
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,720
Hey, the matador's here!

42
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,991
Where? Where? Oh, no.

43
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,834
I feel sick. Oh, Mama.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,799
There's no matador, Guapo.
What?

45
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,474
What a wimp.

46
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,911
Forget it, Guapo.
He's gonna pick me.

47
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,879
I'm the fastest, baddest
bull around.

48
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,236
I'm so fast,
they won't see me coming.

49
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,760
Bones?
Yeah?

50
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,354
You're never
gonna get selected.

51
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,510
You wanna know why?

52
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,630
Why?

53
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,991
'Cause you're a puny
bag of bones, Bones.

54
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,550
You okay?

55
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,473
I don't need your help,
weirdo.

56
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,596
I'm fine!

57
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,830
Careful.

58
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,952
Oh, what do you got there,
Ferdinand?

59
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,600
Uh, nothing.

60
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,114
"Uh, nothing."

61
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,318
Hey! Don't you guys have
some more headbutting to do?

62
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,631
Nah, this is way more fun.

63
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,274
Can you believe this guy?

64
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,714
The matador is gonna
pick a bull...

65
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,634
and all he's worried about
is a dumb flower.

66
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,640
Cut it out, Valiente!

67
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,790
Make me.

68
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,151
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

69
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,557
I'm not gonna fight you,
Valiente.

70
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,795
Aw, flower bull is scared.

71
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,155
I'm not scared.

72
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,960
Then fight.
That's what bulls do.

73
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,790
You can hit me if you want,
but leave the flower alone.

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,639
You're just gonna let him
smack ya?

75
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,031
What? Where's the fun in that?

76
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,279
Whatever.

77
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,192
Have your stupid flower.

78
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,959
The big bulls are going in.

79
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,959
Wish me luck, Ferdinand.

80
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,720
Good luck, Dad.

81
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,599
Go get 'em, Dad!

82
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,036
Come on, guys,
let's see 'em over here.

83
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,280
Out of my way!

84
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,195
Go, bulls!

85
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,599
Whoo-hoo!
Whoa!

86
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,952
It's the matador.
He's gonna pick!

87
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,033
I feel sick.
I think I'm gonna hurl.

88
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,954
You'll get 'em next time, Dad.

89
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,753
Who asked you?

90
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,479
What are you looking at?

91
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,590
Ferdinand!

92
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,392
Ah, there you are!

93
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,510
He picked me.
Can you believe it?

94
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,117
Your dad is gonna fight
for glory in the ring.

95
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,509
You really have to go?

96
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,718
Yeah, of course I have to go.
Come on, Ferd.

97
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,076
This is what every bull
dreams of, right?

98
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,879
I guess.

99
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,436
Is it okay
if it's not my dream?

100
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,394
Well, uh...

101
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,318
Look, Ferd,
you're still a kid, you know.

102
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,194
When you grow up,
your dreams are gonna change.

103
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,880
Everything's gonna change.

104
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,556
I'll tell you one thing
that's gonna change...

105
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,518
you're gonna be bigger
and tougher than your old man,

106
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,590
that's for sure.

107
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,592
No way.
Yes way.

108
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,274
Yeah.
And then you'll see...

109
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,476
you're gonna get in that ring

110
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,914
and you are gonna
be the champ.

111
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,272
Can I be a champ
without fighting maybe?

112
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,433
Oh, Ferdinand.

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,834
I really wish the world
worked like that for you,

114
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,195
I do.

115
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,753
But that's just
not how it is for us.

116
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,513
You understand?

117
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,509
Okay, it's time.

118
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,431
You're gonna come back, right?

119
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,150
What? That matador
doesn't stand a chance, okay?

120
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,476
Okay.

121
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,677
And after I win,
I'm coming back here,

122
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,353
and I'm gonna show you
all my moves.

123
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,910
Even my secret ones.

124
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,675
Dad!

125
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,920
Dad.

126
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,800
I called it.

127
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,872
That bull was soft.

128
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,475
And the soft ones
always go down.

129
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,959
You better bull up.

130
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,037
Oh, hey, what are you
doing out here?

131
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,951
Come on. Get back, get back.

132
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,560
Come back to the stall.

133
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,870
Come on, little guy.

134
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,672
A calf is out! Get him!

135
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,719
Get him!

136
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,600
It's okay.

137
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,631
Shh. It's okay.

138
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,393
Hi, there.

139
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,320
Don't be afraid,
little big guy.

140
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,350
Oh.

141
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,152
You like flowers?

142
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,198
I'll take good care of you.

143
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,115
Come on.

144
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,596
This is your home now.

145
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,075
Go on. It's okay.

146
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,350
<i>Always out of place</i>

147
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,875
<i>I knew I needed
something new for me</i>

148
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,634
<i>I never knewjust
what that was</i>

149
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,393
Okay, your turn.

150
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,796
<i>Finding something safe
was just like</i>

151
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,837
<i>Trying to catch
a bird in flight</i>

152
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,833
<i>I knew that I would
never touch</i>

153
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,440
Who's my good boy?
You're my good boy.

154
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,353
Hey, I thought
I was the good boy.

155
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,593
Good night, Ferdinand.

00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,718
<i>'Cause I'm happy
to call this</i>

183
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,113
<i>Home</i>

184
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,957
Jorge, rise and shine, buddy.

185
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,120
Come on, Jorge, wake up!
Let's go!

186
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,113
Music to my ears.

187
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,714
Ah, it's gonna be a good one.

188
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,678
Oh, I can feel it
in my horns.

189
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,990
Hey, Paco!

190
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,916
Paco!

191
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,276
Pac-attack. Hey, dawg.

192
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,914
You stoked about the big day?

193
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,914
Stoked?
Have you ever seen me stoked?

194
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,833
Look, I've got some bad news.

195
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,320
Gonna stop you right there.

196
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,312
No bad news allowed

197
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,234
'cause today
is Flower Festival day.

198
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,437
Only the greatest day
of the year.

199
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,080
Okay, that's the thing.

200
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,594
This year...
Hold that thought.

201
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,160
Hey, Maria. You ready to put

202
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,357
those wings to work?

203
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,591
Hey, hey, hey. I just finished
herding those chickens.

204
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,670
Launch.

205
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,716
Maria?

206
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,115
Oh, no. Maria?

207
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,033
Congratulations.
Maria!

208
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,271
You shot Maria into the sun.

209
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,160
Oh, way to go, Maria.

210
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,039
Who says a chicken can't fly?

211
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,079
Uh, the laws of nature say it.
I say it.

212
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,959
Chickens are chickens.
Here we go.

213
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,430
Dogs are dogs, and...
Bulls are bulls.

214
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,512
Yeah. Right. Normal.

215
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,433
Hey, if was a normal bull,

216
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,318
I would have never
found this farm.

217
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,960
And we wouldn't be brothers.

218
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,391
A dog and a bull
can't be brothers.

219
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,516
That would be weird.

220
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,875
Really?

221
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,474
Then why does your tail wag

222
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,950
when I call you brother,
Brother?

223
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,070
- Hey. Stop that.
- Hah!

224
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,992
Looks like weird
is the new normal, buddy.

225
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,753
Come on, before everybody
takes off without us.

226
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,990
Ferdinand, wait!

227
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,356
This is what
I've been trying to tell you.

228
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,757
There you are.

229
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,195
You ready to go?

230
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,675
I'm sorry, Nina.

231
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,195
Ferdinand can't come
to the festival this year.

232
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,479
But he goes with us
every year.

233
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,838
I know, but he is not
a little calf anymore.

234
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,792
Then I won't go either.

235
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,110
Listen, honey.
It's for his own good.

236
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,193
But, Dad. It's just Ferdinand.

237
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,273
But outside this farm,

238
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,397
they don't know him
like we do.

239
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,951
Sorry, little big guy.

240
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,034
I'll bring you back
the prettiest bouquet in town.

241
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,270
Okay?

242
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,677
Hey, cheer up, buddy!

243
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,991
Flowers are overrated anyway!

244
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,117
Hah, you couldn't pay me
to go to that festival.

245
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,518
Hey. Why don't we bring Paco?
Fun, right?

246
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,875
I guess.

247
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,154
I am not stoked about this.
Not stoked at all.

248
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,520
This doesn't make any sense.

249
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,630
I'm not a little calf anymore,
so what?

250
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,194
More of me to love.

251
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,273
And besides,
bigger bull, bigger helper.

252
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,510
I'm going.

253
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,600
No. No, no. Juan said no.

254
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,672
Juan said no,
I'm not going. It's settled.

255
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,433
But Nina will be miserable
without me.

256
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,749
She needs me.

257
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,638
Ah... But I need to go,
but I need to stay.

258
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,710
And go. Stay. Go.

259
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,360
What do I do? What do I do?
What do I do?

260
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,430
What do I do?

261
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,277
If that orange doesn't fall
by the time I count to three,

262
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,350
I'm going.

263
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,790
One...

264
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,436
If that rock is still there

265
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,840
by the time I...

266
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,112
What could you possibly
need that for?

267
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,870
Okay.

268
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,036
If that egg doesn't hatch

269
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,998
by the time I count to ten,
I'm going.

270
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,480
One...

271
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,550
Two, three, four, five, six,

272
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,670
seven, eight, nine, ten.

273
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,391
Whew! Didn't hatch.
Flower Festival, here I come!

274
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,710
Oh!

275
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,513
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

276
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,953
Hey! You forgot your bike.
I'll leave it right here.

277
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,630
Wow.

278
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,440
Oh, wow!

279
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,674
This is some next level stuff.

280
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,710
Whoa.

281
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,316
Huh. That was odd.

282
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,232
You don't like the little
piggy balloon?

283
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,271
We'll get you
another balloon, okay?

284
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,357
<i>Gracias, señor.</i>

285
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,430
Oh, nice.

286
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,799
Oh!

287
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,439
All yours, little guy.

288
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,551
Ferdinand.
You shouldn't be here.

289
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,950
What?

290
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,790
Nina!

291
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,717
Oh. Now he acts like a bull?

292
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,235
We have a situation here.

293
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,314
It's okay. It's okay.
He won't hurt anyone.

294
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,595
My baby.
The beast got my baby.

295
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,280
A beast? Where?

296
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,033
Ow! Ow!

297
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,790
Huh?

298
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,834
I'm coming, little baby.

299
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,720
Out of the way!

300
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,956
Whoa!

301
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,630
Got you.

302
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,999
He's a monster.

303
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,995
Keep him away.
Stay away, scary beast.

304
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,674
Ferdinand!
Paco!

305
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,069
They think I'm the beast.

306
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,357
Have you looked
in a mirror lately?

307
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,635
Get back to the farm.
I'll hold them off.

308
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,153
Hey, I'm not done
with you people.

309
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,309
Let's go this way.

310
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,874
Oh, no.

311
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,030
Oh.

312
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,950
Okay.

313
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,793
Think thin.

314
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,194
Ooh.

315
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,438
Step light.

316
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,752
You are a feather.

317
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,196
A 2,000-pound feather.

318
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,160
Slow...

319
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,875
There he is!

320
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,320
Cash or credit?

321
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,231
No! This is not necessary.

322
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,074
You don't have to do this.

323
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,760
- It was an accident.
- Ferdinand!

324
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,112
Stop! You're hurting him.

325
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,352
Nina!

326
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,590
No!

327
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,479
Stop!
No, no, no.

328
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,517
Stay back. Stay back.
Please. Let me take him home.

329
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,558
He's gentle.
Gentle?

330
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,434
He's a wild animal.
Look what he's done.

331
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,432
We have to take him away,
honey.

332
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,355
<i>Señor Moreno.</i>

333
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,875
I think I have something
you need to see.

334
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,475
No!
Wait. Nina. Nina!

335
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,472
Stop! Please!

336
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,915
Ferdinand!

337
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,030
Nina!

338
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,430
Ferdinand.

339
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,034
Ferdinand!

340
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,560
Ferdinand.

341
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,430
No!

342
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,835
Oh, no.
No, not back here. No, no, no.

343
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,713
This can't be happening.

344
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,753
I need to get outta here.

345
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,519
Stop the truck!
Stop the truck!

346
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,400
There's been a mistake. Stop!

347
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,790
Oy! He's going to tear
that truck apart.

348
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,633
<i>What did I tell you,
Señor Moreno?</i>

349
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,750
He's a beast.

350
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,870
Get the calming goat.

351
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,036
Where is the calming goat?

352
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,236
Get the calming goat.

353
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,555
Ow! Ow! Jeez Louise!

354
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,952
Real classy, guys.
Way to treat a lady.

355
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,236
Who's that?

356
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,715
Hey, big guy. Name's Lupe.

357
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,393
I'm going to be
your calming goat.

358
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,631
My calming goat?
That's right.

359
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,154
I'm here to soothe you now.

360
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,516
So you can maim
and gore things later.

361
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,878
Let's try some deep
relaxing breaths.

362
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,120
In. Out.

363
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,190
You're not helping.

364
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,192
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe
you're not helping.

365
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,760
You ever think of that? No.

366
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,354
Because no one
ever wants to help

367
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,999
the stinking calming goat,
right?

368
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,834
Okay, now I got
to calm myself down.

369
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,036
In. Out.

370
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,238
I need to get out!
In. Out.

371
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,473
Whoa! He is a monster.

372
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,831
I think I fell
on something sharp.

373
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,673
Move!
What?

374
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,071
Goat.
Oh!

375
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,112
Oh, sorry about that.
So sorry. So sorry.

376
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,395
Here you go. Here you go.

377
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,678
Watch it, buster.
You could have ki...

378
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,035
Whoa!

379
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,433
Holy beefaroni!
You're ginormous!

380
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,751
Listen. It's Lupe, right?

381
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,713
There's been a huge
misunderstanding.

382
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,354
I really need your help here.

383
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,911
Well, well, hold the phone.
You want my help?

384
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,958
Yeah! That would be amazing.

385
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,349
I've been waiting
for this moment

386
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,831
my whole flea-bitten,
tin-chewing life, mister!

387
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,910
You have?

388
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,798
Oh, yes, I have!

389
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,719
Yes, I have.

390
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,470
Believe it or not,

391
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,472
I'm not the world's
best calming goat.

392
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,630
No...

393
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,360
My true destiny
is to be a coach.

394
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,510
Okay...

395
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,149
Whoo! Look at those pecs.

396
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,678
It's like two little
baby bulls inside of a bull.

397
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,672
Moving on down the flank.

398
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,317
Flank looks good.
A- plus on the flank.

399
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,871
Mama like that.
Mama like that. Whew.

400
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,310
Ow!

401
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,390
Terrible reflexes.
We gotta work on that.

402
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,240
What are you talking about?
Work on what? Whoa!

403
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,234
Getting you ready for the
bullfighting ring, my friend.

404
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,720
That's why you're here, right?

405
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,270
No! Listen, I really need
to get back home.

406
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,994
This is your home.
You made it.

407
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,629
With your raw talent
and my coaching expertise...

408
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,589
<i>we're going from
hola to olé in a day!</i>

409
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,558
No, that is not gonna happen.

410
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,833
Oh. Stop it with the modesty.

411
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,595
You're the bull who destroyed
a whole village, right?

412
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,558
Wrong! It was an accident.

413
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,234
And did you really eat a baby?

414
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,914
You think I ate a baby?

415
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,719
Not denying it. Interesting.

416
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,276
Denying it!
Definitely denying it.

417
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,230
<i>Whoo!
He's a brick, uh, house</i>

418
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,636
I can't wait to show you off
to the rest of the guys.

419
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,120
They're going
to fertilize the yard.

420
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,680
No, no, no. Lupe, wait.

421
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,990
You really don't have to...

422
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,550
Oh. Uh...

423
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,712
Hey, guys. How ya doing?

424
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,280
Lupe in the house.

425
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,755
You suck, Lupe!

426
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,357
Oh, yeah? I used to suck,
but not anymore.

427
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,272
Let me introduce you
to the new guy.

428
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,000
He's a monster
and I'm his coach.

429
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,350
And did I mention

430
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,036
that he is my closest
and dearest BFF...

431
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,475
What did you say
your name was?

432
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,552
Ferdinand? Is that you?

433
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,440
Hey!
That is a ridiculous name.

434
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,080
Tell him your real name,
killer.

435
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,072
Yeah, it's me, Ferdinand.

436
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,190
Hey, guys.

437
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,039
Wait a minute.
You know these chumps?

438
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,431
Whoo! Little Ferdinand.

439
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,791
You've had a growth spurt.

440
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,316
Suddenly I regret every time
I called you weirdo.

441
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,637
Don't sweat it, Bones.
We're good.

442
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,599
My gosh! What have
they been feeding you?

443
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,353
Oh, hey. Guapo?

444
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,432
That's right.
The one and only.

445
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,034
Ah, I get it.

446
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,711
You try to come back here
and intimidate us?

447
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,314
'Cause let me
tell you something.

448
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,474
I am not intimidated
by your freakish hugeness!

449
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,279
Oh, mama.

450
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,590
I don't know you...

451
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,878
but I'm not scared of ya,
you sorry sack of meat.

452
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,600
You're an affront
to my nostrils.

453
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,757
Angus,
you're talking to his butt.

454
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,194
Oh.

455
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,354
I will not take any lip from
the flea-bitten likes of you,

456
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,760
you wee goat.

457
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,872
Now you're talking to my butt.

458
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,275
Aah! Go and boil your head,
ya bunch of bampos.

459
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,476
I'm away.

460
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,470
Uh, a few new faces
around here since I left, huh?

461
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,313
Hello, Maquina. Hi!

462
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,360
He was created in a lab.
A Franken-bull.

463
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,876
Says nothing, feels nothing.

464
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,155
You seem fun.

465
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,516
Look what the goat dragged in.

466
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,750
Hey, Val.

467
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,996
Valiente?

468
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,675
He remembers. Oh, I'm touched.

469
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,790
Hey!

470
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,076
Oh. Didn't see you there,
Bones.

471
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,311
What do you mean you didn't
see me? Oh, I get it.

472
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,550
'Cause I'm small.

473
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,752
You know what you are?
A sizeist.

474
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,032
Guess some things
never change.

475
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,271
Look at you. All grown up.

476
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,517
When you ran away with your
tail between your legs...

477
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,194
I never thought
I'd see you back here.

478
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,720
That makes two of us.

479
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,996
Nah, I get it.

480
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,072
Now that
you're a big tough guy,

481
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,594
you think you're better
than me.

482
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,353
What?
Correction, Valerie.

483
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,240
Actually, he knows
he's better than you.

484
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,834
Ain't that right, F-Bomb?

485
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,195
I didn't say that.

486
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,874
You said it with your eyes.

487
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,673
Well, I'm glad you're back.

488
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,559
You are?
Oh, yeah.

489
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,679
Good to have a real bull
around here for once.

490
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,519
It'll make me look even better

491
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,195
when I beat you to a pulp
inside the ring.

492
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,192
Welcome back, Ferdinand.

493
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,720
Wow. He really hates you.
That was insane.

494
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,910
They all hate me.

495
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,398
Yeah, they hate you.
They hate me.

496
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,956
They hate each other.
A lot of hate.

497
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,113
It crushes your soul if you
let yourself think about it.

498
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,510
Oh, well.

499
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,434
Come on, pal.
Let me show you your new digs.

500
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,270
This is the one.
Ooh.

501
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,673
Get that big butt in there.

502
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,353
Oh, that's heavy. Get in!

503
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,677
Ow!
Isn't this great?

504
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,760
It's smaller than I remember.

505
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,274
Oh, you don't like it?

506
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,511
You know where I live?
A bucket.

507
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,234
And there it is.

508
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,278
Took the liberty
of moving my stuff in,

509
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,033
hope you don't mind.

510
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,590
Wait! I know
what our place needs.

511
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,473
Little feminine touch.

512
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,791
A little something
from me to you.

513
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,354
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

514
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,798
Little bit of regurgitation.

515
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,509
Nighty-night, bestie.
Don't let the bed bugs bite.

516
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,239
No, seriously,
there are bed bugs

517
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,834
and they are vicious.

518
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,390
Huh?

519
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,189
Wow. You weren't kidding
about the bugs.

520
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,516
He saw us. Stay still!

521
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,630
Hey! Why would you stop?

522
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,836
Go back.
We have to do something.

523
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,240
All right,
let's do it old school.

524
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,275
Um... Are you trying
to steal my stuff?

525
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,193
Oh, no. We'd never
do something like that.

526
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,750
Nope. Not us.
You have offended us, sir!

527
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,389
I'm sorry, little guys.
I feel terrible.

528
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,119
Ow!
Don't fall for it, Ferd.

529
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,640
They're filthy weasels.

530
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,757
Hey! We're not filthy weasels.

531
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,320
We're filthy hedgehogs.

532
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,880
She knows what we are.

533
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,839
Yeah.
Beady-eyed, little thieves.

534
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,595
We're not thieves.
We're survivors.

535
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,716
Balls!

536
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,790
Let's roll!

537
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,837
No, wait! Hold on! The flower!

538
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,109
Please don't chew on us!

539
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,920
My greatest fear
is death by chew.

540
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,594
Step back, beast!
Come on.

541
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,359
You wanna dance? Let's dance.
Oh, hey!

542
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,920
Don't tempt me, pinecone.

543
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,150
Will you stop?
Eat quills!

544
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,277
And you,
I'm not eating anyone.

545
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,193
Ha!
Wait, wait. Hold on.

546
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,913
You're not like
the other meatheads, are you?

547
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,116
Don't be fooled, sister.

548
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,272
Where do you think the
word bully comes from, hmm?

549
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,470
It ain't from chickens!

550
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,680
No, no. Look at him!
He's soft and sweet.

551
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,275
Like butter.

552
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,432
Thanks. I think.

553
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,637
Let's start over. I'm Una.

554
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,750
I'm Dos.

555
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,360
And I'm Cuatro.

556
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,239
Oh. What happened to Tres?

557
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,232
We do not speak of Tres.

558
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,310
Oh.

559
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,830
Sorry.

560
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,515
Look, you can
take the food if you want.

561
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,716
I'm not hungry.

562
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,870
Oh, really?

563
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,155
Whoo-hoo! You don't
have to tell me twice.

564
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,074
Ah-bup-bup-bup.
The flower stays.

565
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,960
Good-bye. For now.

566
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,429
Let me give you a boost.

567
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,034
Oh, thank you!

568
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,873
Nah, I don't know.
Ow! Okay, fine.

569
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,599
Ooh! Free ride!

570
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,036
Great to meet you!

571
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,475
What a nice bull.

572
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,710
Oh, yeah.

573
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,837
Sucker won't survive
a day in this place.

574
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,876
Hmm.

575
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,599
I gotta get back home.

576
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,920
Get back. Get back!
Ow, ow, ow. Get back!

577
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,678
Where are my teeth?

578
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,398
All right, I'm going home!

579
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,510
I'm going...

580
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,278
Holy cow, that hurt.

581
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,680
Face is on fire.

582
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,634
Klaus, Greta, look!

583
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,956
Looks like somebody

584
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,430
wants to come
to our side of the fence.

585
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,434
Silly moo-moo.
He doesn't know the rules.

586
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,676
Hey, can you guys help me out?

587
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,354
How do I get
to the other side?

588
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,396
Hmm. How do you get
to the other side?

589
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,274
Oh, let me ponder
this question a little bit.

590
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,516
Mmm...

591
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,956
Spoiler alert! You don't!

592
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,434
Hoof bump. Hoof bump, Klaus.
Hoof bump, Greta.

593
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,638
See, this is the beautiful
horsey side.

594
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,790
And that

595
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,950
is the stinky bull side.
Yeah.

596
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,072
Beautiful horsies stay here,

597
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,356
and you ugly beasts
stay there.

598
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,274
Don't even think of coming
over to our side.

599
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,714
Or we'll alert the humans.

600
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,990
Yeah.

601
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,958
Sucks to be you.

602
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,794
There is no escape.
Nothing gets past us.

603
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,030
Never ever never.

604
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,431
Never ever, ever, ever.

605
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,630
We have eyes

606
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,790
- on the back of our heads.
- Yeah.

607
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,394
The nose of a kitten.

608
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,034
The flexibility of a monkey.

609
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,915
Ears like that
of a cocker spaniel.

610
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,030
Good one.

611
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,476
Shoo! Shoo, shoo!
Go on, stinky one.

612
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,552
Have a nice day
smelling terrible.

613
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,995
Yeah.

614
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,193
I bet his parents
weren't even related.

615
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,835
Wow. People around here
are pigs. Aah!

616
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,116
Aah! Sardine can!

617
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,790
Oh, that turned.

618
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,513
El Primero is coming.

619
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,875
El Primero is coming. Come on!

620
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,474
What?
El Primero is coming here?

621
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,750
El Primero? El Primero!

622
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,594
El Primero!
Oh. Here?

623
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,320
El Primero!

624
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,358
El Primero! El Primero!

625
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,510
El Primero!
What?

626
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,670
El Primero. El Primero.
Ow, ow, ow.

627
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,750
El Primero.

628
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,593
Ow!

629
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,030
El Primero.

630
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,316
Oh! Hey. Uh, sorry about that.

631
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,834
El Primero.

632
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,956
Who?

633
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,515
Big P is in the house!

634
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,956
There are many
great bullfighters in Spain...

635
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,079
but there is only one
El Primero.

636
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,471
You got this, Guap.
You got this. You got this.

637
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,280
Hey, Guapo. No pressure.

638
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,920
Oh, mama!

639
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,595
Don't let that jerk
get in your head, Guap.

640
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,160
Where is he? Show me!

641
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,310
Point me
in the right direction.

642
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,994
Excuse me.
Goat coming through.

643
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,674
El Primero.

644
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,200
<i>Olé.</i>

645
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,797
El Primero! Love you, man.

646
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:47,520
<i>El Primero, señor!
Welcome to Casa del Toro.</i>

647
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,194
What an honor to have you here

648
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,873
<i>at my humble home.
Es un honor.</i>

649
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,238
I do not shake.
My hands are my instruments.

650
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,040
As are my arms, legs,
chest, feet.

651
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,590
And buttocks.

652
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,035
<i>¿Comprende?</i>

653
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,754
<i>Uh... Of course, señor.</i>

654
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,270
I am here to select a bull.

655
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,000
<i>¡Uno!
One?</i>

656
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,834
My final fight. One bull.

657
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,880
The best bull.
Against the best bullfighter.

658
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,360
No, of course.
The best...

659
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,715
for the best.

660
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,916
<i>Sí. I understand.
But we have...</i>

661
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,072
The best against the best.
No, we will...

662
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,039
To see who's
the best-est-est-est.

663
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,112
I have a new bull. I think
will be perfect for you.

664
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,190
Zip!

665
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,431
Only El Primero knows
who is the best.

666
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,115
Sorry. I meant no disrespect.

667
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,279
And yet, I felt disrespected.

668
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,194
Now, what is the best bedroom
in the house?

669
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,475
Uh...

670
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,438
Mine, I suppose.

671
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,829
I'll take that one.

672
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,678
Let me know
when the bulls are ready.

673
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,879
<i>Get the bulls ready
for Señor Primero.</i>

674
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,189
<i>Vamos! Vamos!</i>

675
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,555
Okay, listen up, F-Train.

676
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,870
I've got exactly 30 seconds

677
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,314
to teach you everything
about bullfighting.

678
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,755
Number one. Don't get hit.

679
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,559
Number two.
Destroy anything that moves.

680
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,120
And number three...

681
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,759
Actually, that's it.
It's not that complicated.

682
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,916
Oh, trust me, Lupe.

683
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,799
This is not for me.
Relax, buddy.

684
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,320
It's a slam dunk!

685
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,312
El Primero is going
to take one look

686
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,995
at your big beautiful
hugeness and boom!

687
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,152
You're on your way
to the big show.

688
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:44,916
I can already hear the crowds
in Madrid chanting your name.

689
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,834
Lupe! Lupe! Lupe!

690
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,673
I want the new bull out first.

691
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,634
Well, well.

692
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,430
Looks like
someone's the teacher's pet.

693
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,832
News flash! No one likes
the teacher's pet.

694
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,629
You know I've been waiting
for this day for a long time.

695
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,235
It's gonna get messy,
Ferdinand.

696
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,319
This is it.

697
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,073
Come on! Bring it on!

698
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,233
Let's go! Let's go out there
and give it 110%.

699
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,432
Hey, that better not be
my bucket, Guap.

700
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,199
It's definitely your bucket.

701
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,999
Ugh, gross.

702
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,719
Hey, hey, buddy.
You feeling good?

703
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,830
No. Not really.

704
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,111
Okay. Cool.
Try to have some fun with it.

705
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,555
I'll be sitting
in the front row.

706
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,199
I call it the splash zone.

707
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,119
I'll see ya later.

708
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,434
Impress me.

709
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,080
Release the bulls!

710
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,359
- Nope. Nope. No, no, no.
- Get outta the way!

711
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,636
I'm gonna sit this one out.
Get out there!

712
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,194
Let's go! Get in there.
No, I'll pass, thanks.

713
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,680
Let's go. Move!
You guys go ahead.

714
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,319
Move!

715
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,472
For the glory of Scotland!

716
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,356
Whoo-hoo!
Smash them in the head!

717
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,830
Whoa!

718
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,590
Watch out.

719
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,590
Hey.

720
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,671
Up high. Down low. Too slow.

721
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:43,996
Outta my way, Bones!

722
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,517
Ha! That didn't hurt.

723
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,632
Ferdinand,
El Primero is watching.

724
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,756
You gotta hit something.

725
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,116
Nope. Actually, I'm gonna pass
on the violence.

726
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,511
Well, if you don't hit them,
they're going to hit you.

727
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,512
Gangway!
Whoa!

728
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,920
You finally ready to fight?
Come on!

729
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,835
Guapo with the hit.

730
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,639
Take that, Valiente.

731
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,710
You think you got
what it takes, Guapo?

732
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,359
Then show that to El Primero.

733
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,831
Oh, I will. I'll show him who
the real champ is around here.

734
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,474
Keep it together, Guapo.

735
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,430
Bull down!

736
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,436
Aah!

737
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,275
Hey! Get off me!

738
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:31,990
Enough.

739
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,198
The bullfight is a battle
of wits and strength.

740
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,272
These bulls have nothing.

741
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,632
<i>Espere, señor.
Give the bulls another chance.</i>

742
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,951
My final fight is in two days.

743
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,077
If I do not find the best bull

744
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,038
for the best bullfighter
by then...

745
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:51,393
no bullfighter will ever
use your ranch again.

746
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,520
What did you think you were
doing back there, you numpty?

747
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,114
Are you trying
to make us look bad?

748
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,554
Because you made us look bad.

749
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,791
You made us look real bad.

750
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,350
I was just trying
to help Guapo.

751
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,671
Help? There's no helping.

752
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,912
Oh, you are the worst
fighting bull

753
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,559
I have ever partially seen.

754
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,952
Well, that's because he isn't
a real fighter.

755
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,431
Oh, little Ferdinand
had a growth spurt.

756
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,638
But he's still the same scared
little coward he always was.

757
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,360
Why does not wanting to fight
mean I'm scared?

758
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,035
Yeah. That's ridonculous.
Look at him.

759
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,038
My boy is a killing machine.
Right, Ferd?

760
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,277
No, I'm not a killing machine.

761
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,919
I've been trying
to tell you, Lupe.

762
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,520
You didn't destroy a village?

763
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,478
And I didn't eat a baby.

764
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,954
Not even a nibble?

765
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,476
Eh...
Are you trying to tell me

766
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,314
that you don't want to fight
for glory in the ring?

767
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,800
I'm not a fighter.

768
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,077
I don't understand that
at all.

769
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,630
Yeah, me either.
What else is there?

770
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,910
Whoo!

771
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,719
Whoo-hoo!

772
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,350
Look who got picked
by El Primero.

773
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,914
Who's the bull now?

774
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,471
Uh-huh. Guapo going to
the big show, that's right.

775
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,630
What in the blazes?

776
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,599
I have no idea
what happened back there.

777
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,716
No clue.

778
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,315
But it must have been epic!

779
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,199
What in the deuce
is happening?

780
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,475
Somebody narrate.

781
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,792
I'm gonna be famous! Whoo!

782
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,320
Oh, no!

783
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,439
So long, suckers!

784
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,399
Wait a second.
Where are they taking him?

785
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,710
Uh...

786
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,072
They're taking Guap
to the chop house.

787
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,829
You.

788
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,391
You messed with his head.
This is on you.

789
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,994
Oh, please.

790
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,072
Guapo was never going
to make it to the ring.

791
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,190
We all knew that.

792
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,920
And so, because of that,
he deserves to go there?

793
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,271
Listen to me, Flower Bull.

794
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,669
Things have changed
around here

795
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,750
since you ran away.

796
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,600
Now, you're either a fighter
or you're meat.

797
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,434
Later, meat.

798
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,675
Bones?
Ferdinand!

799
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,038
I'm not...
You okay?

800
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,359
Why wouldn't I be okay?

801
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:08,917
I just have, uh... allergies.

802
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,549
Oh, yeah, sure.

803
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,279
You know,
there's a lot of pollen

804
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,396
in the air this time of year.

805
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:17,632
That's right, a lot of pollen.

806
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,678
Makes my eyes water.

807
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,395
Hey...

808
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,156
I'm really sorry about Guapo.

809
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,312
I know you guys were friends.

810
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,035
Bulls don't have friends,
Ferd.

811
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,590
Guapo was my competition,
okay?

812
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:33,670
I'm fine.

813
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,998
Oh, okay.

814
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,197
I mean, how many times
did I tell him...

815
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,874
"You gotta get
outta your head, man.

816
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,952
"You gotta control
your fears," you know.

817
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,634
But he wouldn't listen.

818
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,190
Sorry.

819
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,837
It's okay to feel bad, Bones.

820
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,513
You won't tell anyone
about this, will you?

821
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,399
I won't say a word.

822
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,950
But if you ever
wanna talk about,

823
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,838
I don't know, allergies?

824
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,155
I'm around.

825
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,160
Thanks, Ferdinand.

826
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,194
You're okay.

827
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,792
Hey, Ferd, look...

828
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,080
if you don't wanna
end up like Guap...

829
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,960
you gotta get your horns
in the game, man.

830
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,840
That's the one thing
Valiente's got right.

831
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,469
I'm comin' for ya,
you bleedin' barrel!

832
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,319
Oh!

833
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,834
And the barrel wins
another round!

834
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,480
Give up, dude.

835
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,438
Hey, big guy, you're on.
Mr. Matador is watching.

836
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,355
I got this. Uh-huh.

837
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,670
I'm ready. Let's go.

838
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,354
Come on!
In. Out. In. Out.

839
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:52,790
Hmm!

840
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,473
Come on, Klaus.
Come on, Greta.

841
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:01,270
<i>Und up! Two, three, four.
Pirouette!</i>

842
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,919
Oh, jealous?

843
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,719
Good prancing, boys.

844
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,073
Oh, yes.
That's the one.

845
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,674
Look alive, F-Stop.

846
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,151
We got 24 hours to whip you
into shape for El Primero.

847
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,714
From now on, you're not soft.

848
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,315
You're not a flower bull.
You're a killing machine.

849
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,039
I'll finally get you
this time, barrel.

850
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,190
Say it with me.

851
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,999
I am a...

852
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,190
Bunny!

853
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,953
Bunny? No, not bunny.

854
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,514
Barrel death!

855
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,717
Stop! Angus, look out!

856
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,671
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

857
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,390
Huh?

858
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,636
Oh, no!

859
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,794
Come on, little guy!
Come on! Come back!

860
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,798
Don't go into the light!

861
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,239
Live, bunny, live!

862
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,073
Ha!

863
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:24,198
Sorry I almost killed you. Ow.

864
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,915
You're not helping
your reputation here, pal,

865
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,992
apologizing
to the bunny rabbit.

866
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,753
But taking out another bull...

867
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,116
that's an energy we can use!

868
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,190
Who did that?

869
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,512
Who pushed me?

870
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:45,033
Ooh!
It was you, wasn't it?

871
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,072
Actually, Angus, it was me.

872
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:51,470
Oh, I'm doomed, I'm doomed,
I'm doomed!

873
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,711
Primero picks a bull
tomorrow...

874
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,951
and I'm talking
to a bloomin' tractor.

875
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,759
That's just your nerves
talking, Angus.

876
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:58,870
You're gonna be fine.

877
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,475
No, I'm not.

878
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,075
First Guapo, now me. I'm next!

879
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,679
Can I tell you
my terrible secret? Hmm?

880
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,199
Can I whisper it in your ear?

881
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,636
Sure.

882
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:18,473
I cannot see very well. Shh!

883
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,796
Once they find out,
it's all over for Angus.

884
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,555
I'm a dead bull walking. Done!

885
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,712
Finito! Kaput!
Angus, wait. Whoa!

886
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,036
Oh.

887
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:32,312
What a surprise. I can see.

888
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,794
Look, a rock! Another rock!

889
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,310
And the world's
most ugliest dog.

890
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:39,990
Huh?

891
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,233
And there it is.

892
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,993
My nemesis!

893
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,551
I'm coming for you,
ya wee wooden devil!

894
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,918
Ha-hah!

895
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,675
I did it!

896
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:55,311
I finally beat you!
Beat you, beat you, beat you!

897
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,233
Oh, look at that.

898
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,909
That's spectacular.

899
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:14,833
You've given me
a fighting chance, Ferdinand.

900
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,918
Why would you do such a thing?

901
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:20,352
If we don't look out
for each other, who will?

902
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,910
Besides, it wasn't
that big of a deal.

903
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,639
It was for me.

904
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,959
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry to kill the mood.

905
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,077
Can I steal you for a second?

906
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,635
I got tears, honestly.

907
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,076
Really did a good thing
out there, pal.

908
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,560
Yeah, come here.

909
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,474
Somethin' I wanna tell ya.

910
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,756
Stop helping the competition!
Ow!

911
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:56,231
What, are you gonna give
Valiente a hoof massage now?

912
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,278
Lupe, I'm not some...
I get it.

913
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,511
You don't like
the bullfighting.

914
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,990
It's because you're hung up
on the blood

915
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,434
and the guts
and the maiming...

916
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,717
and the gore
and the senseless violence.

917
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:07,830
Do you have a point?

918
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:12,030
My point is, it's about more
than just smashing heads.

919
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,830
It's about rhythm
and footwork and grace.

920
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,912
Don't just think of it
as a fight.

921
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,675
Think of it like a dance.

922
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,433
A bull dancing?

923
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,557
Is this some kind
of hilarious joke

924
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,960
designed to make me laugh?

925
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,110
You see, horses,

926
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,038
we have the beautifulest legs
for the dancing.

927
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,913
Bulls have short,
stubby legs.

928
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,270
Yeah. Look at me.

929
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,033
Moo, moo, moo.

930
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:41,958
Go eat a schnitzel,
you pasty-faced glue stick!

931
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,349
It's okay, Lupe,
they're right.

932
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,989
I mean, how could
a big, clumsy bull

933
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,639
ever do something like this?

934
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,632
Whoo! Check out my boy
cuttin' a rug.

935
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,598
Yeah!
That was good.

936
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,558
You call that dancing? Ha!

937
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:03,077
<i>Nein! This is dancing.</i>

938
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,630
Three against one
is hardly fair.

939
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,553
Lupe, get my pipes!

940
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:27,555
Well, put that in your kilts
and smoke it!

941
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,636
Don't celebrate yet,
you rump roast!

942
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,120
Try this!

943
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,637
Ooh, I hate those horses!

944
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,075
It's show time.

945
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,109
I'm going in!

946
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,994
<i>All hooks to the coatrack</i>

947
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,037
<i>Why, why would I hold back?</i>

948
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,435
<i>Click-tack like a Kodak</i>

949
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,318
<i>Just try and stop me
Try and stop me, whoo</i>

950
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,154
<i>Long time to the climax</i>

951
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,232
<i>Fine dime, girl
Let me shine that</i>

952
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,595
<i>Oh, no with the hold back</i>

953
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,717
<i>Just try and stop me
Try and stop me, whoo</i>

954
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,239
<i>I'm on a new trip</i>

955
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,753
<i>A rocket to the moon ship</i>

956
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:22,676
<i>Watch me</i>

957
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,149
Whoa!
Yeah!

958
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,040
<i>Watch me, watch me</i>

959
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,550
<i>Watch me</i>

960
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,757
<i>A rocket to the moon ship</i>

961
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:48,156
Hey, watch where
you're stepping, dummkopf.

962
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,390
Who are you calling dummkopf?

963
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,710
You have four left hooves.

964
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,829
<i>Watch me</i>

965
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,240
Yeah!

966
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,154
I've fallen
and I can't giddyup.

967
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,436
We did it, lads!

968
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:02,756
Oh, yes!
Yeah!

969
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,720
Nice one! Nice one!

970
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,359
That's right,
'cause we're bulls.

971
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:09,871
Go on, horses, prance.
'Cause you can't dance.

972
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,753
<i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

973
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,675
Aw. Why didn't we
do that sooner?

974
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,799
Felt good to put those
show ponies in their place.

975
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:21,237
I haven't laughed like that
since ever.

976
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,397
Maquina, are you smiling?

977
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,880
That's what it is!

978
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,470
A smile!

979
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:30,394
Laugh your way right into
the chop house.

980
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:31,914
That's where you're headed.

981
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,512
No, no! Not if we
get outta here, guys.

982
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:36,875
There are places out there

983
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,440
where you don't
get pushed around...

984
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,751
or shipped to a chop house
for being yourself.

985
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,351
If it's so great out there,

986
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,318
why did they
send you back here?

987
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:48,075
Yeah, Ferd, why did they
send you back here?

988
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,072
Well, because...
Because you're a bull.

989
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,914
You think you're different,
but you're not.

990
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,994
Our only way out is to beat
the matador in the ring.

991
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,793
And that's what I'm gonna do.

992
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:05,678
But by all means, ballerinas,
keep dancing.

993
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:08,992
Tomorrow, I'll be
on the winner's truck.

994
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,276
Don't listen to him, guys.

995
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,000
He's right. We're bulls.

996
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,072
This is the only place for us.

997
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,550
Sorry, Ferd.
I gotta get back to training.

998
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,120
You should, too.

999
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,117
- Guys!
- Ferd, pal...

1000
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,511
I think they got a point.
We're running outta time.

1001
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,831
They wanna stay, I get it.

1002
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,232
But I'm leaving here tonight.
Let's bust outta here, Lupe.

1003
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,591
And go where?

1004
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,638
This is it, Ferd.

1005
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,360
It's a dog-eat-dog,
bull-fight-bull,

1006
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,352
everybody-hate-goat world.

1007
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,557
It doesn't have
to be that way.

1008
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,835
I'll take you to my home.

1009
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:51,394
It's different there.

1010
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:54,029
And Nina...
Nina will love you.

1011
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,352
Who's this Nina?

1012
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,274
And what's love?

1013
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:01,556
So you'll come?

1014
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:05,316
Do you really think...

1015
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,676
I'm just gonna throw away
my three-day dream

1016
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,594
of training a champion bull?
Oh.

1017
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,512
Of course I am!
It was a stupid dream!

1018
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,954
I have a new dream.

1019
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,794
Busting out of this stink hole
with my best friend!

1020
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,112
Just one problem,
this joint is locked up tight.

1021
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,551
No one gets outta this place.

1022
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,638
Actually, that's not true.

1023
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:33,117
A bull wanting to escape
Casa del Toro?

1024
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,078
<i>Hah, good luck with that,
amigo.</i>

1025
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,709
Look, I could
really use your help.

1026
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,235
Do you know a way outta here?

1027
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:42,199
Yeah. We might know a way.

1028
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,317
But what's in it for us?

1029
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,714
Ooh.

1030
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,280
Really?

1031
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:49,430
Excuse me,

1032
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,671
you're re-gifting my gift
to the gerbils?

1033
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,638
First of all, hedgehogs.

1034
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,679
And you will never,
ever buy us

1035
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,558
with a cheap piece of junk.

1036
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,078
Ooh!

1037
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,231
No, don't do it! Resist!

1038
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,880
I can't help it!

1039
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,395
Mmm! It gives me the happies.

1040
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,916
Okay, yeah.
Way to play hardball, Cuatro.

1041
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:28,510
That's the plan?

1042
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,439
You want me to go
through the house?

1043
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,472
If we get caught
inside that house,

1044
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,590
we're toast.

1045
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:34,955
Oh, I love toast.

1046
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,554
You wanna get out of here,
don't you?

1047
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:40,155
Okay. Let's do it.

1048
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:43,000
All right, just do
exactly what we do.

1049
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,276
Balls.

1050
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:10,759
Yeah, maybe don't do
exactly as we do.

1051
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,594
Now, you go through there.

1052
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,677
Me? Through there?

1053
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,000
Uh, have you seen these hips?

1054
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,514
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

1055
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,717
I can't! I can't!

1056
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,192
I'm stuck! Wait!

1057
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:30,194
Get your hoof...
Squeeze in!

1058
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,680
...out of my mouth.

1059
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,593
It's not working.
It's not working.

1060
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,477
Okay, all right,
we gotta do something, guys.

1061
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,757
<i>One, two, three, four</i>

1062
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,718
<i>Uno, do', tres, cuatro</i>

1063
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,554
Whoa, look at
the cute squirrels.

1064
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:01,710
What?

1065
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:06,720
We are hedgehogs!

1066
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:12,630
Okay, it's a straight shot

1067
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:13,870
through the kitchen
to the front door.

1068
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,199
And then, you're home free.

1069
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,396
Piece of cake.

1070
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,074
I love cake.

1071
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:27,231
He's coming down,
he's coming down!

1072
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,595
Run!

1073
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:35,593
Can you just try to be
a little more quiet?

1074
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,874
Shh.

1075
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:57,074
Yikes on a stick.

1076
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:00,438
What are you doing
with 53 swords?

1077
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:22,913
Is that...?

1078
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,280
My dad.

1079
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,713
Oh, Ferd.

1080
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,516
He was the bravest bull
I knew.

1081
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:36,635
He really believed
he could beat the matador.

1082
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,473
All of them did.

1083
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:48,397
The bull never wins.

1084
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:54,072
Come on, Ferd.
Let's get you home.

1085
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,989
The door to freedom.

1086
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,833
Ferd, what are you doing?

1087
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,432
Come on, we gotta go now!

1088
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:12,115
No. I can't leave.

1089
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:15,279
What? Ferd,
this is your only chance!

1090
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,512
The guys back there
still think they can win.

1091
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:20,512
Just like my dad did.

1092
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,109
And I can't let them
end up on that wall.

1093
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,239
Guys? Everybody up, come on!

1094
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,595
We have to go now!

1095
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,840
Have you lost
your bloody mind?

1096
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,514
We have to get
outta here tonight!

1097
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:36,876
El Primero's selecting a bull
in the morning.

1098
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,953
We're not going anywhere.
I'm gonna take his butt down.

1099
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:42,032
No! You don't
wanna get selected.

1100
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,554
Trust me,
it's a death sentence.

1101
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:46,076
- Rubbish! Not if you win.
- That's just it.

1102
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,277
No bull wins. Ever.

1103
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:49,880
I was in Moreno's house,
I saw it.

1104
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,269
Jings! Crivens!
And help ma boab!

1105
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,477
And there's a lot more
where that came from.

1106
01:06:58,560 --> 01:06:59,550
A lot more.

1107
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,154
There's really no way to win?

1108
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,676
You get to fight
in a big fancy arena...

1109
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:06,514
but I'm telling you,
it's just another chop house.

1110
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,392
Why would I believe
a coward...

1111
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,597
who thinks the only way out
is through the back door?

1112
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,315
Are you crazy?
Did you not hear what I said?

1113
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,234
Bulls fight or they go down.
That's how the world works.

1114
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,312
There's nothing left
for you here, Valiente.

1115
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:25,675
Come with us.
No!

1116
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,240
What are you so afraid of?

1117
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,631
I'm not afraid of anything!

1118
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:33,915
Come on, fight me.

1119
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:35,958
I'm not gonna fight you,
Valiente.

1120
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,554
Coward!

1121
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,710
Fight!

1122
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,720
Valiente, stop!

1123
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:42,870
You're soft.

1124
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,314
Like your father.

1125
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,751
And the soft ones
always go down!

1126
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,110
Stop!

1127
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,034
What's going on?

1128
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,234
That one is the best bull.

1129
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,796
I'll fight him
in Madrid tomorrow.

1130
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:49,874
Oh, this is bad.

1131
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:51,793
You got selected
by El Primero.

1132
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:52,870
Do you know what this means?

1133
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,269
A sword through his melon!

1134
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:56,039
Horns on the wall.

1135
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:58,794
Exactly, Maquina.

1136
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,600
We gotta get you
outta here now!

1137
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:05,034
Oh, no. I know that look.
No, no, don't say it.

1138
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,276
I'm not leaving.

1139
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:10,073
Oh! You're killing me!

1140
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:12,277
Not unless everyone
is coming with me.

1141
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:13,350
Yes!

1142
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,079
Sign me up!
I'm in!

1143
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:17,873
Okay, you happy now?

1144
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,394
I said everyone.

1145
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:30,670
Klaus, Greta...

1146
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,354
I'm sorry
for the things I said

1147
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:33,550
about your terrible dancing.

1148
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:35,791
<i>Nein. Nein. Hans...</i>

1149
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:39,590
I am the horse that is full
of the shame and the regret.

1150
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,319
I cannot stay mad at you.

1151
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:43,232
<i>Kommen Sie,
you sons of stallions.</i>

1152
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:45,232
<i>Let's Häagen Dazs it out.</i>

1153
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,354
What is the meaning of this?

1154
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:03,079
How did you get in here,
stinky bull?

1155
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:06,079
Stinky hedgehogs.

1156
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:08,989
I am blinded!

1157
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:10,830
<i>Adiós.</i>

1158
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,353
Greta, Klaus,
where are you?

1159
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,034
Hedge for one...

1160
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,512
And hog for all!

1161
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:21,913
You messed
with the wrong hogs.

1162
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,720
Okay. Let's go!

1163
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:25,599
Hurry! Keep it moving!

1164
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,795
Get to work, Ferd.

1165
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,277
This is an outrage!
Open the door!

1166
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:15,875
Valiente?

1167
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:17,830
Valiente?

1168
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,599
What are you doing here?

1169
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,996
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm getting you outta here.

1170
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,240
Come on!
We don't have a lot of time.

1171
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:30,519
Don't you get it? Look at me!
I'm already done.

1172
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:33,756
Oh, sure.
That makes total sense.

1173
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,071
You're either a fighter
or you're meat, right?

1174
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,754
That's right.

1175
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,354
It doesn't
have to be that way.

1176
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:40,994
You're more than just
a set of horns.

1177
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,230
Come with us.

1178
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:43,794
So I can...

1179
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:46,634
sniff flowers and pal around
with goats?

1180
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,359
No, that's my thing.

1181
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:50,716
You can live
your own life now.

1182
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,519
But not if you give up.

1183
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:57,791
Oh, Mama!

1184
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,075
It's Guapo!

1185
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:00,674
Valiente, come on!

1186
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,069
Go away.

1187
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:06,039
Wow. I thought you were a fighter.

1188
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,919
I guess I was wrong.

1189
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,436
Where are they?

1190
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,512
Open the door!
Get back in there.

1191
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,197
Guapo!

1192
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,715
Guapo!

1193
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,560
Guap... Whoa!

1194
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:23,912
Oh, Ferdinand!

1195
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,720
I did not get picked
by El Primero!

1196
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,475
I know. And that's
a good thing, trust me.

1197
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:30,710
I'm gonna get you down.

1198
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,633
Thank holy goodness.

1199
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:34,355
I didn't think
I was going to make it.

1200
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:37,110
Oh, no.

1201
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:41,670
Ahhh! Help me!

1202
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,160
Hang on!

1203
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:46,070
Ferdinand!

1204
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,555
Hold on, Guapo!

1205
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:49,750
Don't let go! Don't let me go!

1206
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,912
Hang on!
Don't let me go!

1207
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:03,590
Val?

1208
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:05,672
Thought you could use
an extra horn.

1209
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:06,876
Whoa!

1210
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,396
What? What's the problem?

1211
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:12,439
Nothing! You look great. Oh!

1212
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:14,159
So, we getting
outta here or what?

1213
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,311
Over here, guys!
Help!

1214
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:34,310
That wasn't so bad.

1215
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,199
Yeah, quite relaxing.

1216
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:47,680
Watch out!

1217
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,069
What are you guys doing?

1218
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,469
We're trying to help you!

1219
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,791
Well, you're doing
a terrible job!

1220
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:06,675
Anyone got an ice pick?

1221
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,430
Mama!

1222
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:15,916
Here they come!

1223
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:27,879
Holy cow!
Hey, guys.

1224
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:29,713
Guapo lives!

1225
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:31,519
Okay. I deserve that.

1226
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,000
Everybody in!

1227
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:35,480
You better know
how to drive this thing.

1228
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,359
We're about to find out.

1229
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:40,558
Okay, guys. Think thin!

1230
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:45,475
We got company! Hit it!

1231
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:47,470
Yeah!

1232
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:51,672
Bull overboard!

1233
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:54,830
Go!

1234
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,955
Wait for me! Wait for me!

1235
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:17,560
Are you seeing this, too?

1236
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:21,350
If you lose my bull,
I'll fight you in the ring.

1237
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:26,150
Bunny!

1238
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,074
Your turn.

1239
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:36,555
Go!

1240
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,313
Come on, Angus. You can do it!

1241
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:45,437
I'm a bull, not a doctor.

1242
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:06,270
They're getting closer.
Speed up!

1243
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:08,238
I'm pressing as hard as I can!

1244
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,993
Which way?
Hard right.

1245
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:14,839
I don't feel so good.

1246
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,514
Yeah.
Been there, buddy.

1247
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:19,396
I said right!

1248
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:20,835
I thought you meant my right.

1249
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,469

1259
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,756

1260
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:41,990
This is lovely.

1261
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:43,560

1266
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:04,670
That's it.

1267
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:06,274
We gotta get to the train.

1268

Listen, okay.

1329
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:12,354
You are the bravest bull
I know.

1330
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:14,832
You can do this.

1331
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,640
But you're gonna
have to fight.

1332
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:30,477

Aw! You're adorable.

1363
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:39,953
