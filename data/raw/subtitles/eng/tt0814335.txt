He spent the night with
a bottle of Jack Daniel's.

on time and in cash.''

for any identification.

for you, too.

173
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,220
Really?
Jackie pulled a few strings

174
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:14,060
and she can get you a job
working with her as
a real estate agent.

175
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,200
Oh, l couldn't.

176
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,110
Wait a minute.
Of course you can.

177
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:20,060
Okay? Just follow me around
and I'll get you all set up.

178
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,190
lt's a great
opportunity for us

179
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,060
and she really
went out of her way.

180
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:28,040
Well, l can't say no
to my bride-to-be
or her sister, can l?

181
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,050
Thank you, Jackie.
Don't thank me. Thank her.

182
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,170
Because she's
the one who convinced me
to get you off the road

183
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,080
so she can keep
an eye on you.

184
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,280
Oh. Did you?

185
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:43,060
Thank you.
l'm gonna go have
a word with your son.

186
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,250
God, l hope Michael
takes to him.

187
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,270
He will. He's just been
blindsided by the divorce.

188
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,150
He'll bounce back.

189
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:56,130
Michael.
Give me four minutes.
Meet me in the basement.

190
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,110
So, what'd he say?

191
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,210
He said he wants me to
meet him in the basement.

192
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,200

Yeah.

Well, l'm a bit of
a wannabe carpenter.

198
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,050
l built these
storage cabinets myself.

199
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:07,020
And l'm working up
in the attic right now
on some termite damage.

200
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,040

a real toast.

Now, don't let your mom know
l've got a tequila stash.

205
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,090
l've worked my ass off
trying to convince her
l'm perfect.

206
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,120

be a bit of a shock,

207
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,120
your mom and me
getting married and all,

208
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:36,160
but l want you
to know, l want us

209
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,290
to be a real family.

210
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,150
Because without it,
we have nothing?

211
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,040
Oh.

212
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,090
Okay. Touché.

213
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,270
So l get a little
corny sometimes,
but l meant what l said.

214
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You just let me
handle your mother,

215
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,020
and l'm gonna make
sure you stay right here,
where you belong.

216
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,150
No more military school.

217
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,180

family back together,

you're one hell of a swimmer.

225
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,050
Yeah, l do okay.

226
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,070
You know, l used to
swim in competition.
In college, at U of O.

227

Your senior year is
gonna be very important.

228
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,130
You could maybe get
a college scholarship
swimming.

229
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,240
You should be
training this summer.

230
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,160
lt's kind of hard to
train in a backyard pool.

231
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,130
Maybe. But l hear
your old school has
a summer swim program.

232
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,000
lt does, but l can't
use that pool anymore.

But l'll be back
the day after. l'm sorry.

237
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,130
No, that's all right.
l mean, it's the day
l get back,

238
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,170

l'll call someone else.

by the DMV?

l'm sorry, David.
l'm sorry.

is so important to me,

We haven't always had
such great experiences
as a family.

Hey, it wasn't all
Dad's fault.

No, l didn't say it was.

BETH: But, you know,
our family wasn't that bad.

357
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,190
l saw on TV this woman who
drove off a bridge with her
three kids in the back seat.

358

That is so not
dinner-table conversation,

They all drowned.
That kind of thing
really gets to me,

360

that someone
could do that to
her own children.

to make someone do
something so sick.

01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:27,030
Maybe l'm wrong,
but for a while there,

1022
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:29,160
l thought we were
off to a good start.

1023
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:34,060
And now l'm getting the
feeling that somehow we're
not on the same page.

1024
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:38,210
l know it can't
happen overnight, Michael.

1025
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:41,130
But for the sake
of the family,

1026
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:44,270
you gotta understand
that things are going
to change around here.

1027
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:47,070
lt's not gonna
be like it was,

1028
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,280
but hopefully better.

1029
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:51,170
Yeah, l do. l know.

1030
01:06:51,210 --> 01:06:52,220
Good.

1031
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:59,140
l just want you to
always be up-front with me.

1032
01:07:00,170 --> 01:07:03,040
No lies,
no sneaking around.

1033
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:05,210
Your mom wouldn't like that.

1034
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,280
And you need to
win back her trust.

1035
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:23,020
l don't want to see you
have to go back to
that school again.

(FLOOR CREAKS)

1037
01:08:03,050 --> 01:08:04,140
You swore on your life.

1038
01:08:04,190 --> 01:08:05,290
Just look at the
police sketches.

1039
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:07,160
Please,
that's all l'm asking.

1040
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:12,230
There is a resemblance.
You got to admit,
it kind of looks like him.

1041
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:21,030
You know who this
actually looks like?

1042
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:24,180
It looks like Mr. Rockwell,
our biology teacher
from freshman year.

1043
01:08:24,210 --> 01:08:27,080
No, you hardly looked at it.
All right.
It could be anybody.

1044
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:30,010
Look, this is Grady Edwards.
The police couldn't match
his ID.

1045
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:32,150
They couldn't
trace any fingerprints.
And there are similarities.

1046
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:35,020
He said he was in sales.
He said he traveled a lot.

1047
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:36,190
They can never find
any pictures of him either,

1048
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:37,270
so l asked Beth
this morning

1049
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,220
if she could find any
pictures of him in the house,
any pictures of David.

1050
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:43,220
There aren't any because
he doesn't like having
his picture taken, apparently.

1051
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:45,050
So what?
Neither do l.

1052
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:47,200
But l swear
l didn't kill that woman
and her kids. Okay?

1053
01:08:47,230 --> 01:08:48,230
lt doesn't prove anything.

1054
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:50,100
The website was in
the browser history.

1055
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:51,160
He was checking it out.

1056
01:08:51,190 --> 01:08:52,250
So what if he was?

1057
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:55,010
Or maybe it was your mom.

1058
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,240
Or maybe they both
were because they were

1059
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:59,030
curious about what
Mrs. Cutter said.

1060
01:08:59,070 --> 01:09:02,020
l mean, that's what
made you check it out.

1061
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:03,270
All right.

1062
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:06,240
lt's fine.
Just forget about it.

1063
01:09:15,070 --> 01:09:17,150
Are we gonna
finish these, Michael?

1064
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:18,200
Hold on one second.

1065
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:28,120
What is it?
You just don't want to go
to college with me anymore?

1066
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,140
By the way,
l'm screwing Mark Helford.

1067

1068

1069
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,140
l'm leaving.
l'm going home.

1070
01:09:49,050 --> 01:09:50,250

Or, you know what,

1071
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:53,120
don't actually.

No, that's okay.

1079
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:29,070

and you were having
a bit of a fight.

1080
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,110
No.

No, it's cool.

You sure?

1085
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:46,040
Something seems to
be troubling him.

1086
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:48,010
Maybe the two of us
can help him work it out.

1087
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:55,180
l don't know. It's just...

1088
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:59,220
l don't get it.
He's been such a jerk lately.

1089

of him before?

lt's gone. He deleted it
and now there's no pictures
of him anywhere.

1185

deleted it by accident.
No, l didn't...
