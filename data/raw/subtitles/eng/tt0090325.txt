1
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:30,191
STRONGHOLD

2
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,551
We're closed.

3
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,231
You're not going to
give me a hard time, are you?

4
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,719
Right or left?
-Right. Into the jungle.

5
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,195
Wounded tigers always do that.

6
00:05:12,898 --> 00:05:17,720
MILITARY EXERCISE AREA
STRONGHOLD

7
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,799
Is Hugo awake yet?

8
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,799
And Lisa?

9
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,639
It's the same story every morning.

10
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,199
Lisa, eggs.

11
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,069
Speak your own language, damnit.

12
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,632
Get out of bed.

13
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,271
Breakfast in 5 minutes.

14
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,359
And turn that thing off.

15
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,673
Turn that thing off.

16
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,110
The news is coming up.
-Turn it down and come to table.

17
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,197
We pray first.

18
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,954
We still pray here.

19
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,956
Shut up and listen.

20
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,239
I said shut up
and that includes your trap.

21
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,479
Sit down or we'll have to
bury you.

22
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,638
Your chair for my friend.
Your chair.

23
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,157
Fun no? Guests
for a couple of days.

24
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,318
My friend's holding a 9MM parabellum.

25
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,750
They create holes
I can swim in.

26
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,635
Yes.

27
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,079
Deleye speaking.

28
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,231
No, he won't be in today.

29
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,354
Ill. I don't know. Just ill.

30
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,230
Have you got pyjamas?
-Py... pyjamas?

31
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,238
Py... pyjamas, yes

32
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,070
Put on your pyjamas
and go to bed.

33
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,837
Look. Look what I have here.

34
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,990
An afterbirth.
-That's Ruben.

35
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,668
Are you his mother?
-No, she is.

36
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,029
And the father?

37
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,278
You?
-I'm her brother.

38
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,552
Who cares who
your parents are?

39
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,718
But I do need to know whether
the bastard will be coming over.

40
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,356
Poor thing. A whore as a mother
and no daddy. Do you want him?

41
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,948
Make sure nobody gets in our way
while we're here.

42
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,477
Or else...

43
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,559
And that would be messy.

44
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,999
If anything happens to the child...
-It'll be your fault.

45
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,153
What's your name?
-Lisa.

46
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,752
Good, sister. Follow the doctor.

47
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,834
Charlie Six, this is Six.
All quiet, no one in sight.

48
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,474
Zero, this is Six. Get ready.

49
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,996
Come on, little sister.
You can faint in your own time.

50
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,076
Go on, sit on him.

51
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,877
And hold his shoulders.

52
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,199
Not like that. Like this.

53
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,910
No, that's not for us.

54
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,559
It's an exercise.

55
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,472
War? Playing war?

56
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,634
Here, in your garden?

57
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,149
Jim.

58
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,794
What's that noise?

59
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,632
It's an exercise.
Wait until someone starts shooting.

60
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,600
They'll shit themselves.

61
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,354
Good morning.

62
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,669
How is he?
-Who?

63
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,155
Klipsteen.
-Why?

64
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,752
Gangsters at his house.

65
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,997
While I'm here,
nobody needs to be afraid.

66
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,914
HQ to sheriff, over.
HQ to sheriff, over.

67
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,112
The telex came in.
-Read it to me, doll.

68
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,270
Robbery
of illegal casino near Breda.

69
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,110
Loot: 600,000 guilders.
How much is that in francs, over?

70
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,471
A ranch in Texas, a swimming pool
for you and a cattle herd for me.

71
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,956
Armed and dangerous.
Armed and dangerous?

72
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:38,948
Drove off in a dark blue Mercedes.
License plate: FT-41-BE.

73
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,070
Repeat that license plate.
-FT-41-BE.

74
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,953
Damn.

75
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,958
Bloody car.

76
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,914
Damned kid.
-Don't curse, Klipsteen.

77
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,031
Help me instead, damnit.

78
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,355
That kid's never ill
and now he lets me down.

79
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,800
I'm not here.
-He's not here.

80
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,797
Who's letting you down?
-Hugo.

81
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,718
Ill?
-So they say.

82
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,229
Who?
-Who do you think?

83
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,673
'Where's your son', I asked.
He said 'Ill' and hung up right away.

84
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,838
What does he look like?
-I already told you last night.

85
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,713
Black suit?
-Yes, black suit.

86
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,832
Forty years old?
-Something like that.

87
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,315
And the other one, coloured?

88
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,638
Coloured?

89
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,071
I don't know.
He stayed in the car.

90
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,830
He just stayed in the car.

91
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,235
Wounded?
-No, I'm fine.

92
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,476
Not you, the other guy.

93
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,398
The other one.

94
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,595
I don't know. Anything's possible.

95
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,270
Suppose you're hurt and you can't
go to a doctor. Where would you hide?

96
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,038
In this area?

97
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,232
There's nothing here.
The forest, maybe. Or Stronghold.

98
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,673
No, Deleye would shoot
you straight off his property.

99
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,833
Did you listen to the news?
Turn that thing off.

100
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,516
They stole ten million francs.
Ten million.

101
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,109
Where?
-In Holland.

102
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,279
Some kind of gambling den.
Shots were fired.

103
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,470
Not too much or it goes soggy.

104
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,590
Lick it up.
-That was Ruben's food.

105
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,758
Give him a breast
and give me the other one.

106
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,032
Where's your stud? Well?

107
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,715
In my brother's room.

108
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,637
We have no future.
You talk too much.

109
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,955
Did you call them?
Never heard of the police?

110
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,869
Those asses that get you
when you run a red light. Well?

111
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,023
My friend and I always run
all the red lights. Understand?

112
00:22:56,223 --> 00:22:58,434
No.
-No?

113
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,398
But they're coming.
How is that possible?

114
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,598
I don't know.

115
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,837
I'll think of something.
-I hope so for you.

116
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,590
And for the little one.

117
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,239
Dalsum?

118
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,113
Are you here for me?

119
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,789
Not if you've got nothing to hide.

120
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,470
Coffee or something else?
-Coffee and something else.

121
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,635
And I wanted to say hello
to Sybil.

122
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,951
You can do that here.

123
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,431
You know where the bottle is.
-Look.

124
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,078
Was walking around freely.

125
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,879
I'm still looking for two rats.
One with a bullet in its body.

126
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,117
Rats? What rats?

127
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,838
Gangsters, Deleye.
Dangerous gangsters.

128
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,111
Sybil.

129
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,591
How are you?
-Good.

130
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,633
And the children?
-Good too.

131
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,559
But I heard Hugo's ill.
-Yes.

132
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,996
What's wrong with him?
-Flu.

133
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,879
Here.
-Give the little one a hug for me, ok?

134
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,948
Deleye, assume you steal
ten million francs in Holland....

135
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,118
...and then you get stuck here.
What would you do?

136
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,949
With ten million?
-I don't care about the money.

137
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,675
I want to know the hiding place.
-I know a hundred of them.

138
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,835
Exactly.

139
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,669
Want me to list them all?
-No, just the one.

140
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,759
The one I'm not thinking of.

141
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,753
The love bunker.

142
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,238
The love bunker.

143
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,556
Even if you don't have a permit,
you still have to look after it.

144
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,637
Or it'll rust.

145
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,916
Execution postponed.

146
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,791
But the verdict stands.
-Jimmie.

147
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,312
You're a great surgeon.
-Wait until you get the bill.

148
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,515
Have you been friends for long?

149
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,709
His name's Jim.
Call me Charlie.

150
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:58,714
What if I walk out the door?
-That would be very stupid.

151
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,158
We'll be gone tomorrow.

152
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,075
Or the day after at the latest.

153
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,513
Where to?

154
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,238
As far away as possible.

155
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,870
I have my own country.

156
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,313
Doesn't that drive you nuts?

157
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,636
I'd rip off the army and move.

158
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,398
This is my land.

159
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,152
Some cowards live all their
lives on toxic waste.

160
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,038
Is this your car?

161
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,958
And? Does it work?
-Why?

162
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,797
I'm asking the questions here.
-Oh yeah?

163
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,595
Or else I'll get that dried
out bitch of yours...

164
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,236
...and fuck her until she softly
starts to talk.

165
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,477
One more time. Does this
rust bucket work?

166
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,114
Too expensive. A guzzler.
-Not broken?

167
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,438
I think there's a lot wrong with it.
-I'll do the thinking.

168
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,673
Let's see
what your son says.

169
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:29,275
How are you going to prepare that?
-Leave that up to me.

170
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,113
Hello, gentlemen.

171
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,117
Did you poach that rabbit?
-No, sir.

172
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,312
It was already dead.
-Got caught in a trap.

173
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,758
And I said gotcha.
-Is that what you said?

174
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,629
Isn't that allowed?

175
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,438
Is this where you hang out?
-Everybody goes here.

176
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,676
Every patrol.
-To sleep.

177
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,556
Can we keep the rabbit?

178
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,913
I'm looking for a dark blue Mercedes.
-A dark blue Mercedes.

179
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,352
Seen it?
-No, nothing. No.

180
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,232
Enjoy.

181
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,954
Who was that? The cowboy?
-The town cop.

182
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,911
What's wrong?
-Nothing, sir.

183
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,278
What did you want to ask?
-Nothing, sir.

184
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,673
Not about your hourly rate
and coffee breaks again?

185
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,793
No, sir.
-Why are you standing there then?

186
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,594
It's a tiny job.
-What?

187
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,476
And then it'll run fine again?

188
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,475
Yes, it'll run...

189
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,115
To your room. We have company.

190
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,510
What's wrong?
-First the cops, now the cavalry.

191
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,653
They're not here for you,
but for Lisa.

192
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,170
Is she a soldier's whore as well?

193
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:49,293
I'll make you eat your words.

194
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,094
Get those whore-hoppers out of here.

195
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:58,416
Or I'll stuff a skinned
baby down your throat.

196
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,058
Coward.

197
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,131
We're back.

198
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,732
Lots of water bottles to fill
on days like today.

199
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,693
I don't have time for small talk today.

200
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:41,849
Excuse me.
Hurry up, men.

201
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,738
What language are you
speaking to the child?

202
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,138
You don't call him Ruben.
-Wanja'm.

203
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,612
Wanja'm.

204
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:27,257
What would you call me?
-Ramso.

205
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,735
Ramso?

206
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:33,939
Stranger. I have my own country.

207
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:38,733
Here, they think I'm crazy.
-How do I get to your country?

208
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,654
You have to know the way.

209
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,495
Do you?

210
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,615
Sometimes.

211
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:53,777
What a difference with the
frozen corpses we always get.

212
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,613
Delicious.

213
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,776
Is yours that nice too?

214
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,013
Here, taste.

215
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,211
I don't gross you out, do I?

216
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,659
Filthy faggot.

217
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,856
I love you, chicken fucker.

218
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,936
Is nobody finishing their plate?

219
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,173
Then you all have to go to bed early.

220
00:36:04,716 --> 00:36:06,388
He can't sleep.

221
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:12,989
I was dreaming.

222
00:36:14,876 --> 00:36:18,664
That bitch could have split.
-I was dreaming of you.

223
00:36:19,196 --> 00:36:22,950
The child is our security.
-For as long as we'll be here.

224
00:36:23,356 --> 00:36:25,824
Leave that shit factory alone at night.

225
00:36:27,276 --> 00:36:29,426
Everybody always knows better.

226
00:36:29,636 --> 00:36:33,231
Even a gangster's a better mother.

227
00:36:38,436 --> 00:36:41,030
That bitch is gaga.

228
00:36:42,556 --> 00:36:44,592
She sang me to sleep.

229
00:36:48,156 --> 00:36:50,670
Here, keeps you awake.

230
00:36:56,036 --> 00:37:00,746
And? How's the pain?
-The dentist's worse.

231
00:37:05,956 --> 00:37:09,107
What were you dreaming
about me?

232
00:37:13,316 --> 00:37:15,352
I dreamt you were dancing.

233
00:37:16,436 --> 00:37:18,347
With who?
-Alone.

234
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:23,506
You were dancing backward.

235
00:37:25,796 --> 00:37:28,356
With a large bunch of roses.

236
00:37:29,116 --> 00:37:30,947
Red roses.

237
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:33,069
And then?

238
00:37:34,156 --> 00:37:35,828
Then I woke up.

239
00:38:01,636 --> 00:38:03,627
Shouldn't you go
to bed, Dalsum?

240
00:38:04,756 --> 00:38:06,667
A bit restless, Deleye.

241
00:38:07,356 --> 00:38:09,916
How are things here?
-Why?

242
00:38:12,036 --> 00:38:12,991
No reason.

243
00:38:13,196 --> 00:38:16,393
Since when do you
drive around in the dark?

244
00:38:16,996 --> 00:38:19,464
Since there are gangsters around.

245
00:38:20,076 --> 00:38:22,510
If I see them, I'll call you.

246
00:38:31,996 --> 00:38:34,351
They weren't in the love bunker.

247
00:38:34,556 --> 00:38:37,628
Sleep well.
-Goodnight.

248
00:38:43,996 --> 00:38:48,308
You heard what the cop said.
Goodnight.

249
00:38:55,196 --> 00:38:57,027
Go to sleep.

250
00:39:01,956 --> 00:39:05,710
I know who they are.
It was on the radio.

251
00:39:06,596 --> 00:39:10,669
They carry a lot of money,
but I don't know where.

252
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:14,235
In the barn, I think.

253
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:19,872
What are you talking about?

254
00:39:21,476 --> 00:39:22,989
Nothing, nothing.

255
00:39:24,756 --> 00:39:26,872
Don't try anything, you hear?

256
00:39:28,036 --> 00:39:29,788
It's not a game.

257
00:39:30,556 --> 00:39:32,672
One of them is very dangerous.

258
00:39:36,956 --> 00:39:39,151
Shut up, lights out.

259
00:39:41,556 --> 00:39:43,274
And no dirty games, please.

260
00:40:25,036 --> 00:40:26,833
Can't you sleep either?

261
00:40:28,596 --> 00:40:30,632
I keep thinking of Ruben.

262
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:32,670
You?

263
00:40:33,956 --> 00:40:35,389
Your child.

264
00:40:38,476 --> 00:40:40,831
If we don't do anything,
they won't either.

265
00:40:42,476 --> 00:40:47,186
God, if I get my hands on them.
-We've seen that.

266
00:40:57,356 --> 00:41:00,553
Those soldiers this afternoon,
that was my rabbit.

267
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:02,673
Your traps?

268
00:41:15,476 --> 00:41:18,070
I don't empty them.
That's strange.

269
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:21,993
What do you mean?
-It could cause suspicion.

270
00:41:22,716 --> 00:41:25,105
With who?
-Dalsum, for instance.

271
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,705
Cunning old fox.
-Dalsum?

272
00:41:29,556 --> 00:41:31,308
Is everybody sleeping?

273
00:41:41,756 --> 00:41:44,316
That traffic warden from town
is looking for us.

274
00:41:44,516 --> 00:41:45,710
Here?

275
00:41:48,036 --> 00:41:50,596
Not yet,
but he's getting closer.

276
00:41:56,876 --> 00:41:58,628
Did you try that car?

277
00:42:00,676 --> 00:42:03,236
Tomorrow, when it'll be done.

278
00:42:04,476 --> 00:42:06,068
And the Mercedes?

279
00:42:08,796 --> 00:42:10,912
I got rid of it,
an hour from here.

280
00:42:14,316 --> 00:42:16,910
Let's try it tomorrow.

281
00:42:19,476 --> 00:42:21,068
Out of the question.

282
00:42:21,836 --> 00:42:23,315
One more day.

283
00:42:25,036 --> 00:42:27,630
You're the boss,
but I'm the doctor.

284
00:42:31,996 --> 00:42:33,349
We'll see.

285
00:42:40,476 --> 00:42:43,195
I still want to get
my hands on that bitch.

286
00:42:43,876 --> 00:42:44,991
She wants to leave from here.

287
00:42:46,476 --> 00:42:48,034
She's dreaming of it.

288
00:42:50,156 --> 00:42:52,875
You shouldn't dream, but act.

289
00:42:57,996 --> 00:43:01,466
That's her country.
She drew it herself.

290
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,509
Not bad, is it?

291
00:43:08,676 --> 00:43:13,955
I told you she's gaga.
I think she can't even fuck.

292
00:43:16,676 --> 00:43:20,225
Jimmie, do me a favour and go to sleep.
I'll stay awake.

293
00:43:20,436 --> 00:43:21,664
Later.

294
00:43:24,356 --> 00:43:27,268
When I'm sure they're all asleep.

295
00:44:31,276 --> 00:44:35,588
Beautiful, kid.
A voice like a nightingale.

296
00:44:35,796 --> 00:44:38,026
Here, for later.

297
00:44:41,076 --> 00:44:42,828
Asshole.
-Pick it up.

298
00:44:45,796 --> 00:44:48,708
Bend over, country bumpkin.

299
00:44:54,596 --> 00:44:56,154
Go on.

300
00:45:01,476 --> 00:45:02,955
Good boy.

301
00:45:05,956 --> 00:45:08,311
Good, take care of the pennies...

302
00:45:08,556 --> 00:45:11,354
I wish you'd put that gun down.

303
00:45:14,676 --> 00:45:17,986
Do you want it?
You can have it.

304
00:45:32,276 --> 00:45:35,746
I'll have one with ham,
double fried.

305
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:03,351
Granny and me are going to change
the baby's nappy.

306
00:46:04,076 --> 00:46:05,555
Where's Lisa?

307
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:09,472
She doesn't know how to do it,
does she, granny?

308
00:46:09,676 --> 00:46:14,545
I always wash him.
-No wonder she wants to leave the house.

309
00:46:14,756 --> 00:46:16,348
Give me a hand.

310
00:46:19,516 --> 00:46:23,429
I'd rather dance with your sister.
-She's married to a reverend.

311
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:28,435
I worship God in my own way.
-Which way's that?

312
00:46:28,956 --> 00:46:31,311
I show people how
not to live.

313
00:46:31,516 --> 00:46:33,905
And you started early this morning.

314
00:46:34,356 --> 00:46:36,551
I had to be convincing.

315
00:46:38,636 --> 00:46:41,946
We'll be in charge for one more
day, right?

316
00:46:44,436 --> 00:46:46,267
Careful of that poacher.

317
00:46:47,036 --> 00:46:48,628
He wants revenge.

318
00:46:49,836 --> 00:46:51,588
He has one weakness.

319
00:46:53,196 --> 00:46:54,993
The apple of his eye.

320
00:47:21,996 --> 00:47:24,351
Ask your wet sister if
she wants another child.

321
00:47:24,556 --> 00:47:25,545
A child?
-Hear me?

322
00:47:25,756 --> 00:47:27,872
Hurry.
I want a quick answer.

323
00:48:09,716 --> 00:48:12,435
Well?
-She doesn't want it.

324
00:48:12,636 --> 00:48:17,232
Do you understand that?
Sometimes they beg for it. To your room.

325
00:48:54,116 --> 00:48:57,188
Correct me if I'm wrong.

326
00:48:57,396 --> 00:49:00,433
People poach game
to stuff it...

327
00:49:00,636 --> 00:49:03,867
...or eat it,
but not to let it rot.

328
00:49:04,556 --> 00:49:07,070
Why aren't you emptying
your traps?

329
00:49:07,676 --> 00:49:10,190
There are more poachers in the area.

330
00:49:11,836 --> 00:49:17,672
But nobody makes them as well as you.
A professional doesn't like a bad job.

331
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:22,265
You should have become
a preacher.

332
00:49:23,956 --> 00:49:25,833
Does Sybil beat you, Deleye?

333
00:49:26,516 --> 00:49:28,154
I have a bad marriage.

334
00:49:30,516 --> 00:49:32,632
I've known that as long
as I've known you.

335
00:49:36,236 --> 00:49:40,115
You can't tell stories.
I can.

336
00:49:41,116 --> 00:49:43,425
And I'm pretty good at it.

337
00:49:44,476 --> 00:49:48,628
Once there were two crooks
who stole a bag full of money.

338
00:49:49,996 --> 00:49:54,148
But on their way south,
they got stuck.

339
00:49:55,836 --> 00:50:00,114
They needed shelter
and found it.

340
00:50:00,676 --> 00:50:02,712
Not in the love bunker.

341
00:50:06,556 --> 00:50:08,626
But in a remote farm.

342
00:50:11,476 --> 00:50:13,194
The farmers had a choice...

343
00:50:14,676 --> 00:50:18,555
...shut up or be shot.

344
00:50:20,756 --> 00:50:23,554
And to make their intentions clear...

345
00:50:23,756 --> 00:50:27,192
...the crooks beat the farmers up a bit.

346
00:50:31,476 --> 00:50:35,151
How do you like it?
-I don't like stories.

347
00:50:35,596 --> 00:50:37,871
I do.
-Have you finished?

348
00:50:41,476 --> 00:50:42,704
I'm going to search your house.

349
00:50:43,156 --> 00:50:45,716
What did you say?
-I'm going to search your house.

350
00:50:50,836 --> 00:50:53,509
The traffic warden is going
to play cowboys.

351
00:50:53,956 --> 00:50:56,834
One wrong word and we'll
have a massacre on our hands.

352
00:50:58,716 --> 00:51:01,184
What do you know about the law?
-Enough.

353
00:51:01,876 --> 00:51:04,310
I demand a search warrant.
In black and white.

354
00:51:04,516 --> 00:51:07,155
You'll get it.
In the mail.

355
00:51:17,796 --> 00:51:20,390
Sybil, what happened there?

356
00:51:21,956 --> 00:51:24,834
And your husband?
Who beat him up?

357
00:51:25,036 --> 00:51:26,708
Those guys, maybe?

358
00:51:27,836 --> 00:51:30,714
I told you we have
a bad marriage.

359
00:51:30,916 --> 00:51:32,793
These things happen.

360
00:51:48,116 --> 00:51:49,993
Is this your room, son?

361
00:51:51,076 --> 00:51:52,111
Yes, sir.

362
00:51:53,916 --> 00:51:55,144
Do you sleep alone here?

363
00:51:57,356 --> 00:51:59,472
Yes, sir.

364
00:51:59,956 --> 00:52:01,833
What's that then?

365
00:52:04,876 --> 00:52:06,912
Sometimes I sleep there.

366
00:52:07,116 --> 00:52:09,835
But not when you're ill.
-Ill?

367
00:52:11,476 --> 00:52:15,435
Your boss says you're
a good mechanic. Is that true?

368
00:52:15,636 --> 00:52:16,955
I think so.

369
00:52:18,396 --> 00:52:20,591
Do you have to?
The boy's ill.

370
00:52:21,116 --> 00:52:23,072
Yes, I can see that.

371
00:52:24,036 --> 00:52:25,469
It's making him sweat.

372
00:52:36,996 --> 00:52:42,309
Is that Lisa's room?
Yes, and the baby's. He's asleep.

373
00:52:42,956 --> 00:52:46,949
I'll be very quiet.
-If anything happens to the baby...

374
00:52:49,516 --> 00:52:51,632
Are you giving yourself away, Deleye?

375
00:52:54,276 --> 00:52:58,110
I mean, if you scare the baby.

376
00:52:59,796 --> 00:53:03,152
You know who I am.
The law.

377
00:53:03,996 --> 00:53:05,349
The law loves children.

378
00:53:10,636 --> 00:53:12,149
Lisa?

379
00:53:16,036 --> 00:53:19,108
Do you like stories?
-Stories?

380
00:53:20,796 --> 00:53:22,388
Your stepfather doesn't.

381
00:53:40,436 --> 00:53:43,633
In stories, the bad wolf's
always in the bed.

382
00:53:44,356 --> 00:53:48,110
But in this story,
he might be under it.

383
00:53:53,116 --> 00:53:56,631
Do you know where to look for him?
-In the forest.

384
00:54:41,356 --> 00:54:45,065
HQ to sheriff, urgent, over.
-Phone.

385
00:54:45,276 --> 00:54:49,269
HQ to sheriff.
-That thing in your car's beeping.

386
00:54:53,716 --> 00:54:55,991
HQ to sheriff, urgent, over.

387
00:54:58,156 --> 00:55:00,147
Yes.
-Where on earth are you?

388
00:55:00,356 --> 00:55:03,109
I've been trying for 15 minutes.
-What is it?

389
00:55:03,556 --> 00:55:08,550
The dark blue Mercedes is in town.
Did you get that, over?

390
00:55:08,756 --> 00:55:12,066
I'm coming. Over and out.

391
00:55:18,156 --> 00:55:20,192
I made a mistake.

392
00:55:29,996 --> 00:55:32,988
He left as if the devil's
after him.

393
00:55:34,636 --> 00:55:39,346
Does that cowboy have colleagues?
He was called away by radiotelephone.

394
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:43,028
That was his wife.
-He has a wife?

395
00:55:43,236 --> 00:55:46,387
Who wants to be married to
a pig face like that?

396
00:55:46,596 --> 00:55:50,066
Would you want that?
To fuck that teddy bear?

397
00:55:52,636 --> 00:55:54,513
The teddy bear, yes.

398
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:51,112
Where's your friend?
That black guy.

399
00:57:52,596 --> 00:57:55,156
Black guy? Which black guy?

400
00:58:09,476 --> 00:58:13,264
The bus stop is around the corner.
It leaves every half hour.

401
00:58:20,916 --> 00:58:23,669
I wish you would have gotten
your two gangsters.

402
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:28,154
I missed something.
-A hiding place?

403
00:58:28,356 --> 00:58:33,066
I looked everywhere, the peat huts,
Stronghold, the love bunker.

404
00:58:34,356 --> 00:58:37,075
And where does that jerk
find the Mercedes? There.

405
00:58:43,916 --> 00:58:47,113
Is that still in your area?
-That's for me to decide.

406
00:58:47,316 --> 00:58:50,706
But is there a place to hide there?
-It's all farmland.

407
00:58:50,916 --> 00:58:55,068
They can't just have disappeared.
-I so hope you'll get them.

408
00:58:56,236 --> 00:58:57,908
Darling.

409
00:59:30,476 --> 00:59:31,750
That stinks.

410
00:59:32,316 --> 00:59:36,355
What kind of doctor are you?

411
00:59:36,556 --> 00:59:38,706
A crude amateur.

412
01:00:25,076 --> 01:00:27,351
Fireworks, that's all.

413
01:00:59,836 --> 01:01:02,555
There they are again.
Dogs on heat.

414
01:01:06,236 --> 01:01:08,909
Do you make much
running a brothel?

415
01:01:09,316 --> 01:01:11,955
Why don't you ask your mother?

416
01:01:21,436 --> 01:01:23,506
Venomous tongue.

417
01:01:26,756 --> 01:01:29,509
He doesn't bite... yet.

418
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:36,954
Make them go away.

419
01:02:08,756 --> 01:02:11,793
What happened to you?
-I'll tell you.

420
01:02:11,996 --> 01:02:14,066
I'm starting to get fed up with you.

421
01:02:14,996 --> 01:02:18,591
Lisa, here.
With the child, hurry.

422
01:02:21,316 --> 01:02:22,271
Stay here.

423
01:02:22,676 --> 01:02:27,113
But I thought... Didn't we have a deal?
-Yes, to fill up your bottles.

424
01:02:27,316 --> 01:02:29,705
Don't come drool over the girl,
every day.

425
01:02:32,756 --> 01:02:37,876
Excuse me. I didn't know.
-Right, now get lost.

426
01:02:51,836 --> 01:02:54,304
Her admirer will have to jerk off again.

427
01:02:55,796 --> 01:03:00,233
But you're pretty hot.
-Jim, leave her alone.

428
01:03:00,916 --> 01:03:03,430
What's hot?

429
01:03:35,516 --> 01:03:36,869
He knows how to drive.

430
01:03:44,596 --> 01:03:45,915
I wish he'd kill himself.

431
01:03:49,156 --> 01:03:50,475
Coward.

432
01:04:06,516 --> 01:04:08,552
How much petrol do you have left?
-Enough.

433
01:04:08,756 --> 01:04:11,714
Fill it up, park it
with its ass to the back.

434
01:04:46,436 --> 01:04:47,915
Are you asleep?

435
01:04:50,516 --> 01:04:52,393
I know where the money is.

436
01:04:57,356 --> 01:04:58,789
You're not going to do it.

437
01:05:00,156 --> 01:05:02,750
That Jim guy will kill you.

438
01:05:04,796 --> 01:05:07,833
Don't.
-But I'm doing it for you.

439
01:05:08,036 --> 01:05:10,834
For us. So we can leave together.

440
01:05:25,116 --> 01:05:27,550
I see you can stand
on your own legs again.

441
01:05:27,756 --> 01:05:31,192
Can I have this dance?
-Who'll lead? You or me?

442
01:05:31,396 --> 01:05:32,465
Me.

443
01:05:37,876 --> 01:05:41,027
I can give you a ride.
-Get some sleep first.

444
01:05:41,236 --> 01:05:47,345
You've been awake for sixty hours.
-I'll take you straight to Spain.

445
01:05:47,556 --> 01:05:49,433
I'll wake you up in time.

446
01:05:51,036 --> 01:05:52,867
I won't sleep anyway.

447
01:07:28,916 --> 01:07:30,668
You have a beautiful baby.

448
01:07:32,116 --> 01:07:33,947
Does he look like his father?

449
01:07:35,076 --> 01:07:36,429
His father.

450
01:07:37,196 --> 01:07:39,073
Deleye's his father.

451
01:07:40,076 --> 01:07:41,031
That poacher?

452
01:07:43,756 --> 01:07:45,667
Where are you going?

453
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:48,673
As far away as possible.

454
01:07:50,276 --> 01:07:51,629
Don't you have a wife?

455
01:07:52,676 --> 01:07:53,904
Sometimes.

456
01:07:56,916 --> 01:07:58,429
Can I come?

457
01:08:00,796 --> 01:08:04,345
And who'll wash the diapers?
Jim?

458
01:08:04,836 --> 01:08:07,304
Wanja'm stays here.
They repeat it every day.

459
01:08:07,516 --> 01:08:11,350
"You go. We'll look after him."

460
01:08:13,076 --> 01:08:16,705
You have your own country.
That's safer.

461
01:08:18,956 --> 01:08:22,551
Jim and I only have escape routes.

462
01:08:22,756 --> 01:08:25,509
Hiding places and escape routes.

463
01:08:25,716 --> 01:08:29,834
But I can do all kinds of things.
Poach, shoot, drive.

464
01:08:31,596 --> 01:08:32,949
Love.

465
01:08:33,956 --> 01:08:38,472
That would be like Bonnie and Clyde.
-Who are they?

466
01:08:39,756 --> 01:08:44,307
The Romeo and Juliet of crime.
-That's what we'll be. Criminals.

467
01:08:44,516 --> 01:08:48,794
Jesus, can I puke?
I'm getting sick.

468
01:08:49,036 --> 01:08:52,028
Three hours to go.
-Too much talking.

469
01:08:56,076 --> 01:08:57,794
Is he angry?

470
01:08:59,316 --> 01:09:00,874
He's my friend.

471
01:09:11,116 --> 01:09:13,266
Can I be your girlfriend?

472
01:11:26,316 --> 01:11:28,750
Tell me.
-Between you and me.

473
01:11:42,156 --> 01:11:44,272
Problems?
-Her brother.

474
01:11:44,476 --> 01:11:46,671
The money?
-He's dead.

475
01:11:47,276 --> 01:11:50,586
Were is he now?
-In the barn, under straw.

476
01:11:52,036 --> 01:11:53,025
Dump him in the forest.

477
01:11:57,996 --> 01:12:01,352
Now that someone died, we'll need
to get way ahead.

478
01:12:22,796 --> 01:12:23,945
What happened?

479
01:12:25,236 --> 01:12:26,794
A spanner in the works.

480
01:13:23,156 --> 01:13:26,546
What are you doing here, Jos?
-Why does no one take over from me?

481
01:13:26,756 --> 01:13:29,907
You never leave your post,
even if it takes a week.

482
01:13:30,116 --> 01:13:33,950
I don't care. It's two hours on, four
hours off. I've been there for three.

483
01:13:34,156 --> 01:13:35,384
That's impossible.

484
01:13:37,076 --> 01:13:40,466
It's broken.
But I'll report you anyway.

485
01:13:40,676 --> 01:13:44,635
Whatever.
There's no war going on, you know?

486
01:13:44,836 --> 01:13:49,273
Eddie, your turn. And quickly, come.
-Two hours, not a minute longer.

487
01:13:49,476 --> 01:13:51,626
I'm reporting you too.

488
01:13:53,356 --> 01:13:54,789
You're a suck-up.

489
01:14:03,676 --> 01:14:07,146
Put that out.
You can see it from kilometres away.

490
01:14:07,916 --> 01:14:11,192
Who's going to see it?
-Do you want to be reported as well?

491
01:14:11,876 --> 01:14:13,548
Just say the word.

492
01:14:14,076 --> 01:14:17,705
Give a monkey a stripe,
and he thinks he's a general.

493
01:15:04,156 --> 01:15:05,794
A c...

494
01:15:05,996 --> 01:15:08,669
A corpse. There's a corpse.

495
01:15:09,436 --> 01:15:14,271
And I want to close the gap with the
C squad. Is that clear?

496
01:15:14,476 --> 01:15:15,625
All clear, troop captain.

497
01:15:17,376 --> 01:15:21,767
Excuse me, one of our listening
posts found a corpse.

498
01:15:21,976 --> 01:15:25,366
A corpse?
-Correct, sir.

499
01:15:32,736 --> 01:15:36,172
One of us?
-No, it's a civilian.

500
01:15:36,696 --> 01:15:39,085
Does anybody know who it is?
-It was in the forest.

501
01:15:39,296 --> 01:15:41,252
Near listening post Rita.

502
01:15:42,176 --> 01:15:45,373
And who's there now?
-No one. The post has been abandoned.

503
01:15:45,576 --> 01:15:47,168
By you?
-Yes.

504
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:50,732
Never abandon a post.
-No, troop captain.

505
01:15:51,216 --> 01:15:52,729
Court-martial.

506
01:15:53,296 --> 01:15:54,490
Dismissed.

507
01:15:57,256 --> 01:16:00,214
I know that guy.
He's from Stronghold.

508
01:16:00,936 --> 01:16:02,574
The poachers?

509
01:16:02,776 --> 01:16:05,244
Do you want me to go
and have a look?

510
01:16:05,456 --> 01:16:07,572
This is a case for the police.

511
01:16:44,736 --> 01:16:48,092
Did you say gangsters?
-Murderers.

512
01:16:49,736 --> 01:16:53,570
Call the national police, riot police.
Whatever you want.

513
01:16:54,536 --> 01:16:58,415
It'll take hours before they're here.
I'm making an appeal to you, captain...

514
01:16:58,616 --> 01:16:59,765
Troop captain.

515
01:17:00,456 --> 01:17:02,924
If I go alone,
it'll be a massacre.

516
01:17:03,136 --> 01:17:06,208
You only have to be there,
with your troops.

517
01:17:06,856 --> 01:17:09,814
It's an emergency, troop captain.

518
01:17:11,016 --> 01:17:13,132
It's about human lives.

519
01:17:14,256 --> 01:17:15,974
There's even a baby involved.

520
01:17:20,856 --> 01:17:23,654
Can't you call him, Mrs. Dalsum?

521
01:17:29,856 --> 01:17:34,054
Tell him I called and
that he was right.

522
01:17:47,336 --> 01:17:50,408
You have to be able to handle
modern comforts.

523
01:17:51,976 --> 01:17:54,695
We wanted to keep our departure
a secret.

524
01:18:24,176 --> 01:18:26,929
Your cab's here, sir.
-Right on time.

525
01:18:27,136 --> 01:18:30,651
Could you hurry?
Our departure has been reported.

526
01:18:31,656 --> 01:18:33,055
Then the baby stays with us.

527
01:18:53,096 --> 01:18:55,769
What are you doing here?
-Liberating you.

528
01:18:56,256 --> 01:18:59,009
Get lost.
-We know everything

529
01:18:59,216 --> 01:19:01,730
Also that your son's dead.

530
01:19:02,176 --> 01:19:03,768
That who's dead?
-No.

531
01:19:03,976 --> 01:19:06,171
We found him in the forest.

532
01:19:06,376 --> 01:19:11,973
You killed my son.
You killed my Hugo... Let me...

533
01:19:12,176 --> 01:19:16,374
Shut up.
-You killed my son.

534
01:19:20,216 --> 01:19:24,926
You're going to leave now
and receive a medal later.

535
01:19:25,136 --> 01:19:27,411
A medal for courage.
You still have the choice.

536
01:19:27,616 --> 01:19:33,486
Game's over. Police are on their way.
-I count to two and then you're gone.

537
01:19:33,696 --> 01:19:35,573
One.

538
01:19:35,776 --> 01:19:37,095
Two.

539
01:20:04,856 --> 01:20:08,735
A shame.
I'd rather have you dead than alive.

540
01:20:08,936 --> 01:20:12,815
You don't have me yet, fatso.
-I count to three.

541
01:20:13,016 --> 01:20:15,405
Throw away the gun. One.
-And then?

542
01:20:15,936 --> 01:20:19,326
Then I have to fill in
ten thousand forms.

543
01:20:19,536 --> 01:20:21,811
But that's worth it.

544
01:20:22,856 --> 01:20:24,528
Two.

545
01:20:37,576 --> 01:20:41,489
See, fat guy?
Empty handed after all.

546
01:20:50,336 --> 01:20:54,614
No please. Not Ruben, don't.
Give us the child, our child.

547
01:20:54,816 --> 01:20:56,852
Don't. Don't.

548
01:20:57,696 --> 01:21:00,688
I'm going with you.
-We'll let him go after the bend.

549
01:21:00,896 --> 01:21:01,851
Bitch, get lost.

550
01:21:49,896 --> 01:21:52,854
This is the army. Surrender.

551
01:21:53,656 --> 01:21:57,729
I repeat, this is the army.
Surrender.

552
01:23:13,616 --> 01:23:15,686
I can't see anything yet,

553
01:23:32,216 --> 01:23:34,650
We've got him.
Close off all side-roads.

554
01:23:36,256 --> 01:23:38,929
South sector, close off side-roads.

555
01:24:06,936 --> 01:24:10,975
Close off all the side-roads
in the South sector.

556
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:15,295
Car's leaving our sector.
We cease all activity.
