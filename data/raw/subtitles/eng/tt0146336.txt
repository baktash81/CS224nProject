1
00:01:56,231 --> 00:01:58,455
You're listening
to "Under the Covers" with Sasha...

2
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,102
on WZAB, the voice
of Pendleton University.

3
00:02:02,405 --> 00:02:04,821
- We're still talking to-
- Jane.

4
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:07,065
Sophomore. Hi.

5
00:02:07,244 --> 00:02:09,391
So, you've been stealing
your roommate's birth control pills?

6
00:02:09,579 --> 00:02:11,112
Borrowing, okay?

7
00:02:11,247 --> 00:02:14,776
She never noticed before because I've
always replaced them with baby aspirin.

8
00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:18,651
- With what?
- Baby aspirin. Looks exactly the same.

9
00:02:18,964 --> 00:02:21,649
Anyway, so now she's pregnant
and has to leave school.

10
00:02:21,885 --> 00:02:24,301
How am I gonna get a new roommate
this late in the semester?

11
00:02:30,227 --> 00:02:32,374
Oh, my God!

12
00:02:32,562 --> 00:02:34,404
Next caller.

13
00:03:33,412 --> 00:03:34,414
Oh, no.

14
00:03:36,798 --> 00:03:37,680
Shit.

15
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,346
Okay, please make it.

16
00:04:27,938 --> 00:04:30,124
Run outta gas?

17
00:04:30,316 --> 00:04:32,810
Yeah. Fill it up, please.

18
00:04:41,245 --> 00:04:43,124
Freak show.

19
00:05:33,342 --> 00:05:36,065
Miss, could you come inside...

20
00:05:36,304 --> 00:05:38,336
for a minute?

21
00:05:38,515 --> 00:05:39,973
- Please!
- What is it?

22
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:46,564
Your credit card company's
on the phone.

23
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,819
Is there a problem?

24
00:05:48,985 --> 00:05:50,826
They wanna...

25
00:05:52,072 --> 00:05:53,414
speak with you.

26
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,330
Okay, hold on a minute.

27
00:06:01,915 --> 00:06:03,373
Shit.

28
00:06:36,536 --> 00:06:37,994
Hello?

29
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,379
No, don't touch me!

30
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,042
Let me go!

31
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:22,215
Stop!

32
00:07:31,471 --> 00:07:35,499
Someone's in the back seat!

33
00:08:32,997 --> 00:08:35,835
You're "Under the Covers"
with Sasha on WZAB...

34
00:08:36,084 --> 00:08:37,502
the voice of Pendleton University.

35
00:08:37,627 --> 00:08:39,007
Caller.

36
00:08:39,128 --> 00:08:40,662
Hello?

37
00:08:41,756 --> 00:08:42,867
I'm right here.

38
00:08:42,965 --> 00:08:45,228
Felicia, how can I help you?

39
00:08:45,427 --> 00:08:49,300
Well, it's kind of embarrassing.

40
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,519
Spit it out.

41
00:08:51,684 --> 00:08:55,290
Well, that's just the problem.
I mean, I didn't.

42
00:08:56,689 --> 00:09:00,026
Had yourself a little
frat boy protein shake, did ya?

43
00:09:00,318 --> 00:09:02,350
I've been feeling so sick.

44
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:04,408
I swear, I can feel them
swimming inside me.

45
00:09:04,573 --> 00:09:06,912
Should I get my stomach pumped
or something?

46
00:09:07,117 --> 00:09:10,683
I think the only thing you need pumped
is the air out of your head.

47
00:09:10,996 --> 00:09:14,870
First, let me just congratulate you
on your choice of sexual activity...

48
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:18,584
because, sweetie, the world
is not ready for you to reproduce.

49
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,487
Second, did you know that ingestion
of bodily fluids...

50
00:09:21,716 --> 00:09:23,557
is a major safe sex no-no?

51
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:24,983
- Really?
- Really.

52
00:09:25,094 --> 00:09:28,239
My suggestion is that you down
a couple shots of Pepto...

53
00:09:28,515 --> 00:09:31,928
and next time, get away
from the volcano before it erupts.

54
00:09:32,227 --> 00:09:36,178
That wraps up another night.
This is Sasha signing off on WZAB.

55
00:09:36,525 --> 00:09:39,976
Parker, how exactly does Sasha
come up with this stuff?

56
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:42,962
She devours every issue of "Cosmo". 

57
00:09:43,198 --> 00:09:44,810
- Calls it her Bible.
- Thank you.

58
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:50,442
Finish the story
about Stanley Hall.

59
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:52,077
Right.

60
00:09:53,084 --> 00:09:55,730
So, this guy...

61
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,953
he was a professor on campus,
maybe 25 years ago.

62
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:00,634
What did he teach?

63
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:03,213
I don't know.
Physics or some shit.

64
00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:05,576
Abnormal psychology.

65
00:10:05,764 --> 00:10:07,681
You know, if you wanna tell
the story right-

66
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,688
Not the point of the story,
paperboy!

67
00:10:10,937 --> 00:10:13,276
But fine.
Abnormal psych it is.

68
00:10:13,481 --> 00:10:15,091
Anyhoo...

69
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:18,109
this guy, he just flips out,
you know?

70
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:21,622
Goes completely berserk.
Grabs a hunting knife...

71
00:10:23,116 --> 00:10:25,264
and he strolls into Stanley Hall.

72
00:10:25,453 --> 00:10:26,872
Bangs on every door.

73
00:10:29,081 --> 00:10:32,379
And every student
that answers their door...

74
00:10:32,668 --> 00:10:35,468
he takes that little knife,
and he cuts their throat...

75
00:10:35,714 --> 00:10:38,398
ear to ear.

76
00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:41,394
Yeah. He does away
with an entire floor...

77
00:10:41,637 --> 00:10:43,938
before finally stabbing himself...

78
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,748
straight through the heart.

79
00:10:48,477 --> 00:10:49,972
And thus...

80
00:10:50,104 --> 00:10:53,020
the annual Omega Sigma Phi bash.

81
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:57,023
So you have a frat party
to commemorate a massacre?

82
00:10:57,195 --> 00:10:58,345
You betcha.

83
00:10:58,447 --> 00:11:00,095
Let me get this straight.

84
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,078
When this happened 25 years ago...

85
00:11:03,327 --> 00:11:05,859
you were a sophomore.

86
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,528
That's funny.

87
00:11:09,626 --> 00:11:12,732
Well, it's a bullshit story you hear
on every campus in the northeast.

88
00:11:13,004 --> 00:11:15,496
Thank you.
I mean, where's the proof?

89
00:11:15,715 --> 00:11:17,748
You see, that's the thing.

90
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,342
Pendleton knew damn well
that enrollment...

91
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,165
would suffer permanently.

92
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:26,256
So, in cahoots with the national
news media and various other powerful-

93
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:27,829
Like Lee Harvey Oswald?

94
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,199
Or is it Jack Ruby?

95
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,775
No, I know who it was.

96
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,582
It was that F.B.I. guy who used to
prance around in women's underwear.

97
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,171
He covered it all up.

98
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:46,230
That's the news room.
I gotta go. Get a life.

99
00:11:46,499 --> 00:11:48,762
- Hey, Paul!
- Yeah.

100
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,951
Before you go, if there's another
E. coli crisis in the cafeteria...

101
00:11:52,214 --> 00:11:55,052
I want you to have
the biggest, juiciest burger on me.

102
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:59,022
I'd love to. That article
almost got me the student Pulitzer.

103
00:12:00,222 --> 00:12:02,638
- Bye, Paul.
- Bye, Paul.

104
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,422
Know what his problem is?

105
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,400
He can't stand any big story...

106
00:12:06,562 --> 00:12:08,404
without having his byline on it.

107
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:11,688
He is such a babe.

108
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,202
All right?

109
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,004
Did it seem like
he was giving me the eye?

110
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:18,234
It was probably
the mirror behind us.

111
00:12:19,577 --> 00:12:20,881
Oh, damn.

112
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,458
Should I ask him out anyway?

113
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:29,255
If Parker's story is true
and all those kids were murdered here...

114
00:12:29,504 --> 00:12:31,038
why haven't they torn down
Stanley Hall?

115
00:12:31,173 --> 00:12:33,358
because the story's not true.
It's just a legend.

116
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,851
If it's just a legend,
then what's the problem?

117
00:12:36,053 --> 00:12:37,778
- I won't encourage this.
- Come on, Natalie.

118
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,192
Cut me a little slack. This is
half the reason I transferred here.

119
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:44,686
Now what exactly happens
when I say "Bloody Mary" five times?

120
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:49,090
The person standing next to you wonders
how you got into college in the first place.

121
00:12:49,442 --> 00:12:51,896
- Come on.
- You're scared.

122
00:12:52,112 --> 00:12:53,530
Yeah, right.

123
00:12:53,655 --> 00:12:56,110
Then come on and let's do this.
Come on!

124
00:12:56,325 --> 00:12:57,973
Time to raise the dead!

125
00:12:58,118 --> 00:12:59,768
I can't believe this.

126
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,672
Bloody Mary.

127
00:13:25,065 --> 00:13:27,020
Fine. No answer.

128
00:13:27,192 --> 00:13:29,071
Maybe they're screening.

129
00:13:29,236 --> 00:13:30,655
God.

130
00:13:37,453 --> 00:13:38,796
Let's go.

131
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,705
You called?

132
00:13:46,796 --> 00:13:48,982
She was trying to summon
the dead, Damon...

133
00:13:49,174 --> 00:13:52,625
not frat boys
with badly grown facial hair.

134
00:13:52,928 --> 00:13:55,152
It took me a month to grow this.

135
00:13:55,347 --> 00:13:57,840
So is this what you do
for your free time, Damon?

136
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:00,705
Hang out in the dark by yourself,
waiting to scare people like a freak.

137
00:14:00,937 --> 00:14:03,659
Only when I see two losers
stand in front of this relic...

138
00:14:03,898 --> 00:14:05,854
trying to summon the dead.

139
00:14:06,026 --> 00:14:08,327
Anyhow, I'll see you two
in class tomorrow.

140
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:10,561
- Unfortunately!
- See ya.

141
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,082
Jerk.

142
00:14:13,868 --> 00:14:16,476
You know, he was halfway normal
before pledge week.

143
00:14:30,177 --> 00:14:31,635
Sorry.

144
00:14:45,402 --> 00:14:47,167
Shut off the fucking light.

145
00:14:48,906 --> 00:14:50,210
Sorry.

146
00:15:31,494 --> 00:15:35,559
Last week, we discussed
folklore as a gauge...

147
00:15:35,915 --> 00:15:38,484
for the values of the society
that created them.

148
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,401
Today-

149
00:15:41,004 --> 00:15:42,884
Today, we get more specific.

150
00:15:47,428 --> 00:15:51,609
A baby-sitter receives
menacing phone calls.

151
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:54,937
And upon investigating them...

152
00:15:55,102 --> 00:15:57,979
she realizes that
they are originating...

153
00:15:58,232 --> 00:16:00,073
from an upstairs bedroom...

154
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:02,882
the very room...

155
00:16:02,987 --> 00:16:06,016
where she's left the children
under her care...

156
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:08,198
to sleep.

157
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,592
Now, who's heard this before?

158
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,140
Well, that really happened
to a girl in my hometown.

159
00:16:17,335 --> 00:16:19,943
Oh, yes.
I'm sure it did.

160
00:16:20,172 --> 00:16:22,511
I'm sure most of you...

161
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:24,594
grew up thinking
this did happen to girls...

162
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,294
in all your hometowns...

163
00:16:26,429 --> 00:16:28,883
but it didn't.

164
00:16:29,098 --> 00:16:31,859
You see, the baby-sitter...

165
00:16:32,101 --> 00:16:33,788
and the man upstairs...

166
00:16:33,937 --> 00:16:37,505
is what we call an urban legend.

167
00:16:38,734 --> 00:16:40,114
Contemporary folklore...

168
00:16:40,236 --> 00:16:42,536
passed on as a true story.

169
00:16:42,738 --> 00:16:45,346
There are variations
of this one...

170
00:16:45,575 --> 00:16:47,185
going back to the 1960s...

171
00:16:47,326 --> 00:16:52,197
all of them containing
the same cultural admonition:

172
00:16:52,624 --> 00:16:55,539
Young women, mind your children...

173
00:16:55,794 --> 00:16:58,134
or harm will come your way.

174
00:17:03,928 --> 00:17:05,002
Excuse me?

175
00:17:10,434 --> 00:17:13,349
Something funny
you might care to share with us...

176
00:17:13,605 --> 00:17:14,716
Ms.?

177
00:17:14,814 --> 00:17:16,731
No, I was just saying, like...

178
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,391
maybe the cultural admonition is:
Don't baby-sit.

179
00:17:24,158 --> 00:17:26,958
Why don't you come up here...

180
00:17:27,203 --> 00:17:30,886
and volunteer
for my little experiment, hmm?

181
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,841
Yeah, that's a great idea.

182
00:17:34,002 --> 00:17:35,881
Now, young lady!

183
00:17:37,297 --> 00:17:39,982
- Coming.
- Yeah, baby.

184
00:17:40,218 --> 00:17:42,788
Don't worry.
You'll probably survive.

185
00:17:46,349 --> 00:17:48,956
- Had those before?
- Yeah, they're Pop Rocks.

186
00:17:49,185 --> 00:17:51,486
They crackle in your mouth.

187
00:17:51,688 --> 00:17:53,184
Eat some.

188
00:18:03,076 --> 00:18:04,572
Thirsty?

189
00:18:06,454 --> 00:18:07,872
Well, what's wrong?

190
00:18:07,997 --> 00:18:10,989
Something you might have heard
about mixing Pop Rocks and soda?

191
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:13,513
Well, supposedly...

192
00:18:13,712 --> 00:18:16,588
your stomach and your intestines,
everything bursts.

193
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,368
Really? Anyone you know
who died this way?

194
00:18:20,678 --> 00:18:22,711
Mikey, from the cereal commercial.

195
00:18:22,889 --> 00:18:24,807
Give it to Mikey.
He'll eat anything.

196
00:18:28,186 --> 00:18:29,605
You mean him?

197
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,418
Mikey likes it.

198
00:18:37,363 --> 00:18:40,355
What if I told you
that this is Mikey...

199
00:18:41,743 --> 00:18:44,964
alive and well and working
as an ad executive in New York City?

200
00:18:45,246 --> 00:18:47,126
Would you drink some then?

201
00:18:52,295 --> 00:18:53,523
I'll do it.

202
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:11,606
Your soda.

203
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,702
Voila! Still alive.

204
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,097
As I said, class...

205
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:28,240
this story is nothing
but an urban legend.

206
00:19:36,845 --> 00:19:38,379
Professor!

207
00:19:39,723 --> 00:19:40,643
He's gonna explode!

208
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,707
Somebody call 911! Go!

209
00:20:03,415 --> 00:20:05,447
Thank you for your help.

210
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,734
Brilliant. He's brilliant.

211
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,183
He is such a moron.

212
00:20:11,423 --> 00:20:13,380
Yeah, but who fell for it?

213
00:20:15,803 --> 00:20:17,107
Hey, what's going on?

214
00:20:17,222 --> 00:20:19,331
Excuse me, young man.
Can't read these.

215
00:20:19,516 --> 00:20:21,357
She just left the campus.

216
00:20:24,605 --> 00:20:27,596
- She went to Pendleton?
- You have got to be kidding me.

217
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:29,968
I knew I should've gone to N.Y.U.

218
00:20:31,195 --> 00:20:32,116
Tragic, huh?

219
00:20:33,447 --> 00:20:34,445
Hi.

220
00:20:37,327 --> 00:20:38,438
Is this true?

221
00:20:38,536 --> 00:20:40,070
I certainly hope so.

222
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:43,389
Otherwise I'm gonna have
one hell of a retraction on my hands.

223
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:50,582
What do you think you're doin'?

224
00:20:50,758 --> 00:20:53,021
You can't just come
and take every copy here.

225
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:56,210
You're the one that wrote
this inflammatory piece of rubbish.

226
00:20:56,473 --> 00:21:00,155
Actually, the fatuous quotes about
being deeply shocked and heartsick...

227
00:21:00,477 --> 00:21:01,665
are yours, Dean Adams.

228
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,534
Let me tell you something,
young man.

229
00:21:03,689 --> 00:21:07,178
The only lunatic
on this campus is you.

230
00:21:07,484 --> 00:21:10,784
I'm flattered.
Can I quote you on that?

231
00:21:12,532 --> 00:21:15,562
I have a quote for ya.
"U.S. News and World Report"...

232
00:21:15,827 --> 00:21:19,508
named Pendleton the safest university
in this country.

233
00:21:19,831 --> 00:21:22,440
And you best believe,
I intend to keep it that way.

234
00:21:23,752 --> 00:21:25,708
Thank you, Reese.
I'll make sure...

235
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,909
and stick that in the special
school safety edition.

236
00:21:29,174 --> 00:21:31,053
Hold on a second.
How about some interviews, you know?

237
00:21:31,219 --> 00:21:34,057
Students react to
the tragedy on campus.

238
00:21:34,306 --> 00:21:36,261
I am saddened and moved by-

239
00:21:36,432 --> 00:21:38,388
This was someone's life.

240
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,743
Did you even spend one minute
thinking about that?

241
00:21:42,022 --> 00:21:44,054
No, I didn't.

242
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:47,186
But because of my story,
3,500 students will.

243
00:21:47,445 --> 00:21:49,862
I think that's enough
to help me sleep at night.

244
00:21:51,157 --> 00:21:52,269
Come on. Let's go.

245
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,269
The decapitated body
of 20-year-old...

246
00:21:56,455 --> 00:21:58,487
Pendleton student, Michelle Mancini...

247
00:21:58,665 --> 00:22:00,582
was found in her car.

248
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:03,474
Police suspect her assailant
was probably hiding in the back seat.

249
00:22:03,713 --> 00:22:06,627
In the meantime, the search continues
for Michael McDonald...

250
00:22:06,882 --> 00:22:09,950
the proprietor of this gas station
where she was last seen.

251
00:22:10,219 --> 00:22:13,901
Police are asking anyone with
any information on his whereabouts...

252
00:22:14,224 --> 00:22:15,604
to contact them immediately.

253
00:22:15,726 --> 00:22:19,101
This is David McAree
reporting live.

254
00:22:19,396 --> 00:22:20,929
That's horrible.

255
00:22:21,064 --> 00:22:23,710
Someone told me that she was listening
to my show when it happened.

256
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:25,630
My voice was probably
the last thing she heard.

257
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:28,961
- Can you imagine?
- What if there is a lunatic on campus?

258
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,579
That's fine with me. I'm hitting the
half pipe at Kellington this weekend.

259
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:33,663
Did anyone here know her?

260
00:22:33,829 --> 00:22:35,477
She roomed in Daley.

261
00:22:35,622 --> 00:22:36,927
- No.
- No.

262
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:39,878
Hello?

263
00:22:41,003 --> 00:22:42,307
Space cadet.

264
00:22:43,256 --> 00:22:45,327
Oh, no, I didn't know her.

265
00:22:47,134 --> 00:22:50,317
Actually, you know,
I did know her.

266
00:22:50,596 --> 00:22:52,169
- You did?
- Yeah.

267
00:22:53,266 --> 00:22:55,414
I'll miss her, too, because...

268
00:22:55,603 --> 00:22:57,367
that girl gave great head.

269
00:23:00,107 --> 00:23:01,333
You get it?
She gave great head.

270
00:23:01,442 --> 00:23:02,900
- Come on!
- That was good.

271
00:23:14,415 --> 00:23:15,450
Hey, Tash.

272
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:17,995
- Sorry about last night.
- Yeah?

273
00:23:18,211 --> 00:23:20,090
Well, don't let it happen again.

274
00:23:32,643 --> 00:23:34,292
Here. You dropped these.

275
00:23:43,446 --> 00:23:44,597
Excuse me?

276
00:23:48,577 --> 00:23:51,416
This is my phone line too.

277
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:02,523
Hey, it's Brenda.
You seemed kind of weird this afternoon.

278
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:05,021
You okay, hon? Call me.

279
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,907
Natalie, it's Mom.

280
00:24:07,055 --> 00:24:09,701
Listen, sweetie, I'm just calling
to make sure you're okay.

281
00:24:09,933 --> 00:24:12,350
Isn't it horrible about Michelle?

282
00:24:13,645 --> 00:24:15,870
Please call, okay?
I love you.

283
00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:51,649
Hey! I was just
in the neighborhood.

284
00:24:51,771 --> 00:24:53,611
Thought I'd drop by,
see if you wanted to go to the house.

285
00:24:53,772 --> 00:24:55,728
Parker said he's gonna
pierce Hootie's nose.

286
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,164
Hootie's a dog.

287
00:24:57,276 --> 00:24:59,539
Yeah, there's no reason
he can't be hip.

288
00:24:59,738 --> 00:25:01,119
No, that's okay, Damon.

289
00:25:02,115 --> 00:25:03,495
What's up? You all right?

290
00:25:03,616 --> 00:25:05,112
Yeah, I'm fine.

291
00:25:05,244 --> 00:25:08,810
Listen, we don't have to go hang out
with a bunch of drunken frat boys.

292
00:25:09,122 --> 00:25:11,999
We could just
go someplace and talk.

293
00:25:14,712 --> 00:25:16,705
I don't really want this
to get out around campus...

294
00:25:16,881 --> 00:25:19,643
but I can actually be a pretty good
listener every once in a while.

295
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,994
- A little something to warm you up?
- Sure.

296
00:25:40,574 --> 00:25:42,760
It's a slight process.

297
00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:53,587
Oh, God.

298
00:26:03,057 --> 00:26:04,897
So you and Michelle
were friends then?

299
00:26:05,058 --> 00:26:06,898
Yeah.

300
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,556
So what happened?

301
00:26:08,688 --> 00:26:11,103
I'd really rather not
talk about it anymore.

302
00:26:11,315 --> 00:26:13,271
It's completely understandable.

303
00:26:13,443 --> 00:26:15,783
If you don't want to open up,
that's fine.

304
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,196
I want you to know that...

305
00:26:20,408 --> 00:26:22,594
I know exactly
what you're going through.

306
00:26:22,786 --> 00:26:24,896
- You do?
- Sure.

307
00:26:26,749 --> 00:26:29,012
I lost somebody close to me.

308
00:26:33,298 --> 00:26:35,063
My girlfriend, she's-

309
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:40,425
- She's dead.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

310
00:26:40,681 --> 00:26:42,561
No, it's okay.

311
00:26:43,934 --> 00:26:46,081
She was sick for awhile.

312
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,379
She had...

313
00:26:48,564 --> 00:26:50,520
a syndrome...

314
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:54,029
and after that...

315
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:59,521
I was afraid to get close to anybody
for a long time, but then...

316
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:01,782
it hit me, you know.

317
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,753
Why am I being so selfish?

318
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:07,952
I still have so much love
inside of me left to give.

319
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:10,281
- You do?
- Yeah, and Natalie...

320
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:12,419
you're in need of loving.

321
00:27:12,591 --> 00:27:14,239
- I am?
- Yeah.

322
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:16,378
You're lonely.
You're repressed.

323
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:18,432
You're aching to break loose.

324
00:27:18,597 --> 00:27:20,744
Those are the type of problems
that only a man can fix.

325
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:24,270
And, I suppose,
you're that man.

326
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:27,800
Well, you know-

327
00:27:30,402 --> 00:27:34,621
Nice try. That was a fairly good
impersonation of a human being.

328
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:37,597
I understand, you're afraid.

329
00:27:37,826 --> 00:27:39,858
But you don't
have to be afraid anymore.

330
00:27:40,036 --> 00:27:42,261
You don't have to
be afraid to love.

331
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:44,851
Start the car right now.

332
00:27:44,959 --> 00:27:47,375
Okay, that hurt. I'm just trying
to help you out here.

333
00:27:47,587 --> 00:27:49,312
You don't have to act
like such a bitch.

334
00:27:49,464 --> 00:27:51,306
It's not an act.
Believe me.

335
00:27:53,718 --> 00:27:55,827
You sure you don't wanna
think this over?

336
00:27:56,013 --> 00:27:58,352
because I'm all about healing.

337
00:27:58,557 --> 00:28:01,319
One black eye or two?
You decide.

338
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,917
All right, fine.

339
00:28:06,065 --> 00:28:08,213
I'm gonna take a piss.
I'll be right back.

340
00:28:11,154 --> 00:28:12,152
Pig.

341
00:29:20,063 --> 00:29:21,904
Shake it and let's go.

342
00:29:42,629 --> 00:29:43,627
Come on!

343
00:30:14,998 --> 00:30:17,376
Don't start the car.

344
00:31:24,114 --> 00:31:28,334
This is the end of your rotten life,
you motherfuckin' dope pusher!

345
00:31:36,086 --> 00:31:39,844
It was easy for him because he really
didn't believe it was coming.

346
00:31:40,173 --> 00:31:43,970
But it ain't gonna be easy for you
because you better believe this coming.

347
00:31:44,303 --> 00:31:45,721
Girl, what's wrong with you?

348
00:31:45,846 --> 00:31:48,647
They killed him!
Somebody killed him!

349
00:31:51,727 --> 00:31:53,991
It's right past this bridge.

350
00:31:56,441 --> 00:31:58,320
I don't see nothing.

351
00:31:58,485 --> 00:32:00,787
Are you sure this is it?

352
00:32:11,582 --> 00:32:14,957
- I don't get it. The car was-
- Here, huh?

353
00:32:15,253 --> 00:32:18,091
You don't mind me asking-
What the hell are you on?

354
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,294
Nothing! The car was right here.

355
00:32:23,554 --> 00:32:27,735
- Right here.
- I saw his body. I touched it.

356
00:32:28,101 --> 00:32:30,363
It's probably the same person
who killed Michelle Mancini.

357
00:32:30,562 --> 00:32:31,980
That's impossible, baby.

358
00:32:32,104 --> 00:32:35,749
The police arrested that gas station
attendant this afternoon.

359
00:32:39,488 --> 00:32:41,444
It was a mannequin.

360
00:32:41,615 --> 00:32:44,644
Damon uses it all the time
to scare pledges during hazing.

361
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:48,439
He also has this
life-size blow-up doll.

362
00:32:48,748 --> 00:32:51,125
- But you don't wanna know about that.
- It wasn't a mannequin.

363
00:32:51,334 --> 00:32:53,827
- Damon was dead.
- Come on.

364
00:32:54,046 --> 00:32:57,190
Damon is the best practical joker
on this campus, all right?

365
00:32:57,466 --> 00:33:00,919
He once convinced a freshman he was
the middle Hanson brother to get laid.

366
00:33:02,597 --> 00:33:06,662
- Shouldn't he be enjoying his handiwork?
- Weekend snowboarding trip.

367
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:09,626
Some last-fling bachelor party
with some high school buddies.

368
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:11,389
Come on.

369
00:33:14,442 --> 00:33:15,937
Whoa, wait a minute.

370
00:33:16,069 --> 00:33:17,642
Scratching on the roof
of the car.

371
00:33:18,906 --> 00:33:20,862
Don't you guys get it?

372
00:33:21,034 --> 00:33:23,027
Come on.
Just like that urban legend.

373
00:33:23,202 --> 00:33:25,196
- What are you talking about?
- Come on.

374
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:27,787
Wexler talks about it
every semester in class.

375
00:33:27,999 --> 00:33:31,489
You know? Guy and a girl
parked out in the woods, making out.

376
00:33:31,795 --> 00:33:34,364
- You made out with him?
- Guy steps out of the car...

377
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,737
and the girl starts to hear
these scratching noises on the roof.

378
00:33:36,925 --> 00:33:39,571
It's her dead boyfriend,
hung from a tree.

379
00:33:39,803 --> 00:33:41,682
Damon's in the class.
He knew the myth.

380
00:33:41,848 --> 00:33:43,727
He must've just planned
the whole thing out.

381
00:33:43,892 --> 00:33:47,113
Well, I thought it was the only way
a girl would ever say he was hung.

382
00:33:47,395 --> 00:33:49,082
Conniving bastard.

383
00:33:49,231 --> 00:33:50,304
Wait a second.

384
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:51,932
Isn't there another story...

385
00:33:52,067 --> 00:33:55,211
about a guy with an axe
hiding in a woman's back seat?

386
00:33:55,487 --> 00:33:59,629
Hello? My mom still checks the back seat
before getting into a car.

387
00:33:59,992 --> 00:34:01,986
That's how Michelle Mancini died.

388
00:34:02,161 --> 00:34:03,311
Oh, my God.

389
00:34:03,413 --> 00:34:04,639
What are you trying to say?

390
00:34:04,747 --> 00:34:08,314
It's like someone out there
is taking all these stories...

391
00:34:08,626 --> 00:34:10,352
and making them reality?

392
00:34:13,215 --> 00:34:15,784
Then my big question is,
what is he gonna do next?

393
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:19,693
Maybe put spider eggs in bubble gum
or ram a gerbil up a celebrity's ass.

394
00:34:21,223 --> 00:34:22,872
Come on!

395
00:34:23,017 --> 00:34:24,819
Give Damon a call
up at Kellington.

396
00:34:24,978 --> 00:34:26,742
You'll see he's there.

397
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,350
- Do you mind if I use-
- What?

398
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,031
Never mind.

399
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:50,747
Yeah, there was a blonde guy who arrived
with that group this morning.

400
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,198
Bachelor party or something.

401
00:34:53,384 --> 00:34:55,992
Damon Brooks, specifically.
Can you tell me if he checked in?

402
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,482
Well, I really
can't tell you that.

403
00:34:58,681 --> 00:35:02,439
The cabin's not in his name,
and it's not on his credit card.

404
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:06,834
Look, I'm happy to take the message,
but I can't guarantee he'll pick it up.

405
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:09,032
So whatever you want me-

406
00:35:47,943 --> 00:35:49,401
Hello?

407
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:00,452
Is someone there?

408
00:36:33,534 --> 00:36:34,991
- Look what I found.
- What?

409
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,036
An early edition of "Kama Sutra"...

410
00:36:37,205 --> 00:36:39,467
with illustrations.

411
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:41,890
You think Parker'll get into it?

412
00:36:42,085 --> 00:36:43,582
Does he have a choice?

413
00:36:46,924 --> 00:36:48,344
What's that?

414
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,960
- Don't tell me you still think-
- I don't know.

415
00:37:11,201 --> 00:37:13,196
This is it.

416
00:37:25,924 --> 00:37:29,107
Wait a second.
This is definitely not a myth.

417
00:37:29,386 --> 00:37:31,994
- What?
- The "Gang High Beam Initiation. "

418
00:37:32,223 --> 00:37:33,488
It happens all the time.

419
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,977
Gang members drive around at night
with their headlights off.

420
00:37:36,185 --> 00:37:39,369
And when someone goes to flash their
high beams to warn them, they kill them.

421
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:43,990
That's why I never warn anybody
about anything when I drive.

422
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:47,127
Anyway, I gotta go.

423
00:37:47,282 --> 00:37:48,969
I got some homework.

424
00:37:49,117 --> 00:37:50,689
- See you later.
- Bye.

425
00:39:37,568 --> 00:39:40,674
Sounds like Elvira's raising more
than just the dead in there.

426
00:39:40,947 --> 00:39:42,481
Thanks for the warning.

427
00:39:59,175 --> 00:40:01,899
I'm sorry.
I'm not looking.

428
00:41:55,593 --> 00:41:58,969
Better check her pulse.
She's looked like that for years.

429
00:42:15,907 --> 00:42:17,824
- How is she?
- I don't know.

430
00:42:17,992 --> 00:42:19,872
I haven't had a chance
to talk to her yet.

431
00:42:23,373 --> 00:42:25,981
All right.
I'll see you later.

432
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,508
We know this is
difficult for you, but...

433
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,213
we need to understand why...

434
00:42:32,426 --> 00:42:34,227
if you heard moaning...

435
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,609
you didn't turn on the lights?

436
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:40,026
I'd walked in on Tash having sex before.

437
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:41,919
It wasn't something
I cared to see again.

438
00:42:42,061 --> 00:42:44,438
So you never actually
saw anyone there.

439
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:45,681
I sensed that-

440
00:42:45,773 --> 00:42:48,804
No, honey, did you
see anyone in the room?

441
00:42:51,613 --> 00:42:54,720
Did you know
Tash was manic-depressive?

442
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:58,904
She painted half the room black.
I had a pretty good idea.

443
00:42:59,434 --> 00:43:00,719
There are no signs
of foul play here.

444
00:43:01,123 --> 00:43:03,194
No forced entry.

445
00:43:03,376 --> 00:43:04,909
What are you saying?

446
00:43:05,044 --> 00:43:08,381
It appears to be
a tragic suicide.

447
00:43:08,673 --> 00:43:11,587
No. Tash didn't kill herself.

448
00:43:11,843 --> 00:43:14,489
There was someone else
in that room.

449
00:43:14,721 --> 00:43:16,792
"Aren't you glad you didn't
turn on the lights," for Christ's sake?

450
00:43:16,974 --> 00:43:19,812
A very morbid suicide note.

451
00:43:29,737 --> 00:43:33,612
Honey, I am so sorry.
Are you all right?

452
00:43:35,035 --> 00:43:38,026
Of course not.
Stupid question.

453
00:43:38,288 --> 00:43:40,589
I mean, who would've thought
she would do something like that?

454
00:43:40,791 --> 00:43:43,285
I mean, she's weird
and everything, but-

455
00:43:50,343 --> 00:43:52,413
You wanna go get some coffee
and talk?

456
00:43:52,595 --> 00:43:54,782
I just gotta be alone right now.

457
00:44:20,668 --> 00:44:24,159
I know that this is
a really bad time for you...

458
00:44:26,633 --> 00:44:28,741
but I gotta ask you
a couple of questions.

459
00:44:28,926 --> 00:44:31,150
No, I'm not doing
any interviews.

460
00:44:31,346 --> 00:44:35,067
If it makes you feel any better,
I don't wanna talk about Tash.

461
00:44:35,393 --> 00:44:37,732
I just wanted to know...

462
00:44:37,937 --> 00:44:40,162
if you can tell me
a little bit about this.

463
00:44:41,399 --> 00:44:42,396
How did you get that?

464
00:44:44,485 --> 00:44:46,748
I contacted
Michelle's high school-

465
00:44:46,947 --> 00:44:48,481
your high school-

466
00:44:51,034 --> 00:44:53,949
Now, why didn't you tell me
you knew her?

467
00:44:54,205 --> 00:44:57,082
So you could exploit her death
more than you already have.

468
00:44:58,585 --> 00:45:00,041
I'm just doing my job.

469
00:45:00,169 --> 00:45:03,621
Okay? What am I supposed to do?
Turn my back on a murder?

470
00:45:03,923 --> 00:45:05,686
Or a suicide?

471
00:45:05,842 --> 00:45:07,453
It wasn't a suicide.

472
00:45:07,594 --> 00:45:09,933
What are you talking about?

473
00:45:10,139 --> 00:45:12,133
She was murdered.

474
00:45:12,308 --> 00:45:14,763
Just like Michelle.
Just like Damon.

475
00:45:23,403 --> 00:45:26,164
I don't know what's
going on here, but...

476
00:45:26,406 --> 00:45:29,590
you know, if you want,
we can go somewhere and talk.

477
00:45:30,953 --> 00:45:32,373
Off the record.

478
00:45:46,303 --> 00:45:48,834
- You don't believe me either.
- That's not what I'm saying.

479
00:45:49,056 --> 00:45:51,510
It's just that...

480
00:45:51,725 --> 00:45:55,446
the idea of an urban legend
serial killer...

481
00:45:57,398 --> 00:45:58,588
it's a stretch.

482
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:01,774
But don't you think it's possible?

483
00:46:01,903 --> 00:46:03,937
Yeah, it's possible.

484
00:46:05,866 --> 00:46:07,669
But I don't know.

485
00:46:09,078 --> 00:46:11,302
Maybe the gas station attendant
killed Michelle.

486
00:46:11,497 --> 00:46:13,682
Maybe Damon's snowboarding.

487
00:46:13,874 --> 00:46:16,252
And maybe...

488
00:46:16,461 --> 00:46:18,302
Tash just killed herself.

489
00:46:20,548 --> 00:46:22,542
If it is true...

490
00:46:22,718 --> 00:46:24,175
why like this?

491
00:46:24,303 --> 00:46:26,106
Why now?

492
00:46:27,347 --> 00:46:29,227
Tonight's the 25th anniversary.

493
00:46:32,061 --> 00:46:33,441
What's that got to do
with anything?

494
00:46:33,563 --> 00:46:35,442
The Stanley Hall Massacre.

495
00:46:35,607 --> 00:46:39,174
I told you,
that story is not true.

496
00:46:40,653 --> 00:46:42,149
Are you sure?

497
00:46:46,868 --> 00:46:49,437
All right, if there's any truth
to Stanley Hall...

498
00:46:49,663 --> 00:46:51,466
it'd be in here.

499
00:46:53,459 --> 00:46:55,722
So this is where you research
all your lurid articles.

500
00:46:55,921 --> 00:46:58,759
Reality is lurid, all right?

501
00:47:00,258 --> 00:47:02,175
I'm only the messenger.

502
00:47:02,343 --> 00:47:04,799
'71-'72, '74.

503
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:10,465
That's weird.
'73's not here.

504
00:47:20,948 --> 00:47:22,251
How long you been workin' here?

505
00:47:22,366 --> 00:47:24,360
Too damn long.

506
00:47:24,535 --> 00:47:26,338
You know anything
about Stanley Hall?

507
00:47:31,375 --> 00:47:33,446
I don't know
what you're talking about.

508
00:47:33,628 --> 00:47:35,162
Did anyone die there?

509
00:47:38,926 --> 00:47:40,076
Please.

510
00:47:41,595 --> 00:47:43,513
We really need to know.

511
00:47:48,895 --> 00:47:50,506
Talk to Wexler.

512
00:47:56,153 --> 00:47:59,950
It's his office hours.
He should be here.

513
00:48:00,282 --> 00:48:01,931
Here. Watch out.
Just a second.

514
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,516
Would you look at that?

515
00:48:29,022 --> 00:48:30,977
So do they
teach you this in class?

516
00:48:31,149 --> 00:48:34,487
I dropped Journalism Ethics early in
the semester. Wasn't helping my G.P.A.

517
00:49:33,842 --> 00:49:35,491
Oh, shit.

518
00:50:05,501 --> 00:50:07,458
- Is he gone?
- Yeah.

519
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:17,288
Something I can help you with?

520
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:20,963
You two break in
to a professor's office...

521
00:50:21,269 --> 00:50:24,298
and then have the audacity
to accuse him of murder?

522
00:50:24,564 --> 00:50:26,405
We found the axe.

523
00:50:26,566 --> 00:50:30,670
That is a prop
I use in my folklore class.

524
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:33,637
How can you even suggest that I had
anything to do with that girl's death?

525
00:50:33,866 --> 00:50:37,050
Why don't you tell us
about the Stanley Hall Massacre?

526
00:50:39,956 --> 00:50:41,950
Professor Wexler, Reese...

527
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:44,618
may I have a moment alone
with them?

528
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:51,852
After our talk this morning...

529
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:54,849
I decided to take a look
at your personal file.

530
00:50:58,977 --> 00:51:01,969
Probation for
reckless endangerment?

531
00:51:03,648 --> 00:51:05,719
It was just for a year.

532
00:51:05,901 --> 00:51:07,741
I'd already been accepted here.

533
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:09,935
Which was lucky.

534
00:51:10,113 --> 00:51:11,570
We don't usually accept...

535
00:51:11,699 --> 00:51:14,653
students with a criminal record.

536
00:51:15,703 --> 00:51:17,275
As for you, young man...

537
00:51:17,414 --> 00:51:19,062
you're off the paper...

538
00:51:19,207 --> 00:51:20,856
effective immediately.

539
00:51:21,001 --> 00:51:23,647
No, you can't do that, okay?

540
00:51:23,879 --> 00:51:25,412
Read the charter.

541
00:51:25,547 --> 00:51:28,347
The dean can't dictate
editorial policy.

542
00:51:28,593 --> 00:51:30,855
I didn't fire you.

543
00:51:31,053 --> 00:51:34,313
Your editor did.
We spoke an hour ago.

544
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:36,478
Have a good weekend.

545
00:51:41,314 --> 00:51:43,921
What was all that about?
Reckless endangerment?

546
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:46,681
We're not exactly talking about
running a stop sign here, are we now?

547
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:49,127
I really don't
wanna talk about it.

548
00:51:49,323 --> 00:51:51,010
Oh, okay, what do you want
to talk about?

549
00:51:51,158 --> 00:51:53,536
My career options
without a body of writing samples?

550
00:51:53,745 --> 00:51:56,467
Because for your information,
they're kind of limited.

551
00:51:56,706 --> 00:52:00,311
It was in high school.
It's over.

552
00:52:00,627 --> 00:52:03,005
Look. Does this have something
to do with Michelle Mancini?

553
00:52:03,213 --> 00:52:06,127
Hey, I just wanna know
what's going on here...

554
00:52:06,383 --> 00:52:09,222
because I don't know
if I buy it anymore.

555
00:52:11,472 --> 00:52:13,275
I don't know
if I ever bought it.

556
00:52:40,545 --> 00:52:43,575
It's gonna be a wet one
out there tonight, folks.

557
00:52:43,841 --> 00:52:46,103
The storm is expected to bring
four inches of rain...

558
00:52:46,301 --> 00:52:49,868
and 30-mile-per-hour winds
throughout most of New England.

559
00:52:50,181 --> 00:52:52,865
Local authorities are advising
everyone to please stay indoors.

560
00:52:53,101 --> 00:52:56,055
If you do decide to go out though,
make sure you grab a slicker.

561
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,685
Natalie, nothing is
gonna happen to me.

562
00:53:55,877 --> 00:53:58,485
But why do you keep doing this
to yourself?

563
00:53:58,714 --> 00:54:00,324
Look at you.

564
00:54:00,466 --> 00:54:02,346
You've gotta stop this.

565
00:54:07,265 --> 00:54:09,030
I knew Michelle Mancini.

566
00:54:11,144 --> 00:54:13,560
We went to high school together.

567
00:54:15,941 --> 00:54:17,820
We hadn't spoken in...

568
00:54:17,985 --> 00:54:19,404
two years.

569
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,543
Why?

570
00:54:27,287 --> 00:54:30,279
We were in my car one night.
Michelle was driving.

571
00:54:32,251 --> 00:54:35,396
The story about the gang high beam
initiation had been going around.

572
00:54:37,756 --> 00:54:39,827
Michelle wanted to play
a practical joke...

573
00:54:40,009 --> 00:54:42,579
so she turned the headlights off...

574
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:47,402
and waited for the first car
to pass by and flash us.

575
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:51,885
When someone finally did...

576
00:54:52,063 --> 00:54:53,905
she made a U-turn and...

577
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,781
started chasing him...

578
00:54:58,487 --> 00:55:00,290
flashing her high beams, laughing.

579
00:55:04,327 --> 00:55:06,091
I was laughing, too,
at first...

580
00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:09,555
then we started going really fast.

581
00:55:14,255 --> 00:55:16,480
I wanted to tell her to stop...

582
00:55:18,592 --> 00:55:20,395
but I just sat there.

583
00:55:22,597 --> 00:55:25,628
And then the other car
lost control and ran off the road.

584
00:55:33,609 --> 00:55:35,373
He was our age.

585
00:55:38,864 --> 00:55:41,434
By the time the ambulance came,
he was already dead.

586
00:55:46,122 --> 00:55:48,308
The courts were lenient with us.

587
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,727
We just got probation.

588
00:55:56,008 --> 00:55:58,923
I was never able to forgive her
for what she did.

589
00:56:01,681 --> 00:56:05,670
I guess I couldn't forgive myself
for not doing something more to stop it.

590
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:07,898
Oh, my God.

591
00:56:08,063 --> 00:56:10,134
How awful...

592
00:56:10,316 --> 00:56:11,927
for everyone.

593
00:56:13,235 --> 00:56:15,344
I don't know.
I think I should just go home.

594
00:56:15,529 --> 00:56:19,749
Come on. You need to be relaxed,
have some fun and come to the party.

595
00:56:21,661 --> 00:56:23,310
Please?

596
00:56:23,455 --> 00:56:25,679
- Promise you won't leave me alone.
- I promise.

597
00:56:25,874 --> 00:56:29,440
Unless, of course, I hook up with
some cute, little blue-eyed journalist.

598
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:32,247
Then you might have
to fend for yourself.

599
00:57:34,198 --> 00:57:35,770
- Don't do that.
- Sorry.

600
00:57:35,909 --> 00:57:37,212
Little jumpy?

601
00:57:37,327 --> 00:57:40,280
No, not at all.

602
00:57:40,539 --> 00:57:42,609
I was just thinking.

603
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:44,670
Me too.

604
00:57:44,835 --> 00:57:49,016
It wouldn't be a bad idea to add a few
extra guards this weekend just in case.

605
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:50,800
In case what?

606
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:53,839
Well, after that suicide and
what happened to the Mancini girl...

607
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:57,432
now I'm having trouble locating another
student, a boy named Damon Brooks.

608
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,641
He's been missing
for some days now.

609
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:03,262
Missing? He's not missing.
It's the weekend.

610
00:58:03,564 --> 00:58:05,787
He's probably shacked up
in some motel...

611
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:09,319
with a girl or a guy
or a farm animal.

612
00:58:09,612 --> 00:58:10,954
Whatever.

613
00:58:11,072 --> 00:58:12,528
Weren't you ever 18?

614
00:58:12,657 --> 00:58:15,418
- Not that kind of 18.
- My point is...

615
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:17,999
I don't want you overreacting.

616
00:58:18,204 --> 00:58:22,308
Don't contact anyone
without my permission.

617
00:58:22,668 --> 00:58:24,470
No parents. No police.

618
00:58:24,628 --> 00:58:27,428
- Is that understood?
- Understood.

619
00:58:27,674 --> 00:58:28,939
Good night, sir.

620
00:59:48,345 --> 00:59:50,761
Go! Come on, boy!
There you go!

621
00:59:50,973 --> 00:59:53,198
There you go!
That's my boy!

622
01:00:03,319 --> 01:00:05,581
I love you!

623
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:07,928
Hey, listen.

624
01:00:12,538 --> 01:00:15,490
That scream,
that's an actual cry for help...

625
01:00:15,749 --> 01:00:17,590
by a girl being murdered.

626
01:00:17,752 --> 01:00:20,359
- You're kidding me?
- No!

627
01:00:20,587 --> 01:00:22,313
That's why it sounds so real...

628
01:00:22,465 --> 01:00:25,342
because it was lifted
off a 911 tape.

629
01:00:26,428 --> 01:00:27,732
- That's great.
- Yeah.

630
01:00:40,693 --> 01:00:42,457
Hey, you made it!

631
01:00:44,697 --> 01:00:46,845
And already,
I'm starting to regret it.

632
01:00:47,034 --> 01:00:48,989
I'm gonna get something to drink.
You want anything?

633
01:00:49,161 --> 01:00:50,848
- A beer.
- Okay. Be right back.

634
01:00:50,996 --> 01:00:54,525
Stanley Hall's not a legend.
There was one survivor that night.

635
01:00:59,047 --> 01:01:01,041
It makes perfect sense.

636
01:01:01,216 --> 01:01:03,171
Pendleton covered up
Stanley Hall...

637
01:01:03,343 --> 01:01:05,989
and Wexler, so long as
he keeps his mouth shut...

638
01:01:06,221 --> 01:01:08,061
he gets a job for life.

639
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:10,908
- Why would he do it?
- It eats at him.

640
01:01:11,143 --> 01:01:14,939
And probably every year around
this time, he goes a little wacko.

641
01:01:15,272 --> 01:01:17,535
This year, off the charts.

642
01:01:17,734 --> 01:01:20,878
Well, then, we have to call the police
right away before it happens again.

643
01:01:21,153 --> 01:01:22,649
I already tried.

644
01:01:22,781 --> 01:01:24,467
Dean Adams beat me to it.

645
01:01:24,615 --> 01:01:27,415
They said he warned them
to expect some prank calls tonight.

646
01:01:27,661 --> 01:01:29,502
He even gave them our names.

647
01:01:35,294 --> 01:01:36,560
Look.

648
01:01:40,592 --> 01:01:42,625
I'm sorry I doubted you before.

649
01:01:45,222 --> 01:01:46,565
What?

650
01:01:50,227 --> 01:01:53,181
- Hey.
- What is he trying to do to me?

651
01:01:56,943 --> 01:01:58,439
I'm so scared.

652
01:01:59,821 --> 01:02:01,623
Hey...

653
01:02:01,782 --> 01:02:03,545
listen to me.

654
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:06,576
Nothing's gonna happen
to you, okay?

655
01:02:06,828 --> 01:02:08,401
I promise.

656
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:22,888
You don't waste any time, do you?

657
01:02:24,431 --> 01:02:27,115
- Here. It's light.
- Oh, shit.

658
01:02:27,351 --> 01:02:29,193
What was all that about?

659
01:02:30,104 --> 01:02:31,600
I screwed up.

660
01:02:57,675 --> 01:03:00,744
Jesus! You trying to give me
a heart attack here?

661
01:03:02,973 --> 01:03:05,658
The building's off-limits
after 10:00.

662
01:03:08,187 --> 01:03:09,952
Good night to you too.

663
01:03:32,964 --> 01:03:34,268
Hello?

664
01:04:14,093 --> 01:04:16,126
Oh. What?

665
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:19,296
Hey, Parker.

666
01:04:20,224 --> 01:04:22,448
Let me talk to you for a second.

667
01:04:22,643 --> 01:04:24,521
Look, you might wanna
end this party a little early.

668
01:04:24,686 --> 01:04:25,875
What?

669
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:27,859
Natalie was right all along.

670
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,469
Say no more.
Everybody, listen up!

671
01:04:32,654 --> 01:04:34,916
No, listen.
Turn the music down.

672
01:04:35,115 --> 01:04:36,688
Listen, everybody.

673
01:04:38,202 --> 01:04:40,925
Paul here, he thinks
we should end the party.

674
01:04:42,539 --> 01:04:43,258
No.

675
01:04:44,291 --> 01:04:46,747
Tell everybody
why they should go home.

676
01:04:50,006 --> 01:04:51,579
There's a killer on campus.

677
01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:55,005
And let me guess.

678
01:04:55,136 --> 01:04:58,282
This killer is offing people...

679
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:01,307
based on urban legends.

680
01:05:01,435 --> 01:05:03,085
Yeah, that's right.

681
01:05:04,981 --> 01:05:08,778
Well, I've got a legend
that you may or may not have heard of.

682
01:05:09,111 --> 01:05:13,751
This mediocre Woodward and Bernstein
wanna-be realized...

683
01:05:14,157 --> 01:05:17,264
I'm gonna graduate in a couple of weeks
and end up writing gardening tips...

684
01:05:17,537 --> 01:05:19,645
for Martha Stewart's "Living. "

685
01:05:19,830 --> 01:05:22,208
Hang on.
Unless I get a really hot story.

686
01:05:22,417 --> 01:05:24,411
Something that really flies.

687
01:05:24,586 --> 01:05:26,733
I got it.

688
01:05:26,921 --> 01:05:29,759
I'll take advantage
of my homicidal instincts...

689
01:05:30,008 --> 01:05:31,234
and I'll start killing people...

690
01:05:31,343 --> 01:05:34,411
in a trendy,
attention-getting, cover-story...

691
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:35,792
kind of way...

692
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:38,997
basing them on urban legends.

693
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:43,953
Why don't you have another drink?

694
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:48,214
Maybe you're the one that should leave
and let everybody else have a good time.

695
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:49,912
Right?

696
01:05:54,243 --> 01:05:57,465
You stay here. I'm gonna go
get some help, all right?

697
01:06:00,917 --> 01:06:02,527
Why do you always
have to be such a jerk?

698
01:06:02,669 --> 01:06:04,854
I was just messing around.

699
01:06:05,046 --> 01:06:07,386
I'm gonna go
to the radio station, okay?

700
01:06:07,591 --> 01:06:10,122
Hey, who's my girl?

701
01:06:13,096 --> 01:06:14,094
That's my girl!

702
01:06:20,938 --> 01:06:22,281
Let's go.

703
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:29,834
Hello?

704
01:06:34,787 --> 01:06:37,051
You're gonna die tonight.

705
01:06:38,625 --> 01:06:40,389
Oh, really?

706
01:06:45,048 --> 01:06:49,574
I see. The call's coming
from inside the house.

707
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:53,728
Could it be an urban legend?

708
01:06:54,058 --> 01:06:56,436
Am I right? Hello?

709
01:06:56,644 --> 01:06:58,714
Hey, don't get shy on me
all of a sudden, fuck face.

710
01:06:58,896 --> 01:07:01,542
This is the one about
the baby-sitter, right?

711
01:07:01,774 --> 01:07:04,804
She's getting those scary,
harassing phone calls.

712
01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:07,255
When she traces them back...

713
01:07:07,447 --> 01:07:10,093
they're coming
from inside the house, right?

714
01:07:10,325 --> 01:07:14,045
But aren't you forgetting something?
I'm not baby-sitting any kids.

715
01:07:14,371 --> 01:07:17,171
Wrong legend. This is the one
about the old lady...

716
01:07:17,417 --> 01:07:20,754
who dries her wet dog
in the microwave.

717
01:07:44,237 --> 01:07:46,807
Goddamn, fucking sick,
motherfucker!

718
01:07:47,033 --> 01:07:48,529
Hootie. Fuck!

719
01:07:49,952 --> 01:07:51,064
Wanna fuck with me?

720
01:08:27,117 --> 01:08:28,459
Are you sure it's blood?

721
01:08:28,578 --> 01:08:30,955
I'm sure it's blood.
I'm covered in it.

722
01:08:31,163 --> 01:08:33,963
Due to the storm, all units
are presently responding to calls.

723
01:08:34,209 --> 01:08:36,471
- A unit has been called.
- You know what really chaps my hide?

724
01:08:36,670 --> 01:08:38,817
It's the way you pledge
to serve and protect...

725
01:08:39,005 --> 01:08:41,498
and then you don't give a rat's ass
when something really happens.

726
01:08:41,717 --> 01:08:43,059
Hold, please.

727
01:08:45,638 --> 01:08:47,709
I'll do it myself.

728
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:54,994
This is Paul.
Leave a message.

729
01:08:57,901 --> 01:09:00,125
So let me get this straight.

730
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:03,234
You guys just tried out this new
sexual position and you're stuck.

731
01:09:03,490 --> 01:09:06,558
- I'm not stuck. He is.
- Just relax and stop clenching.

732
01:09:06,827 --> 01:09:09,512
I saw this happen to dogs once.
It is so humiliating.

733
01:09:09,748 --> 01:09:12,164
All right, you guys,
this is what you're gonna do, okay?

734
01:09:13,292 --> 01:09:14,635
Hello?

735
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,643
Are you guys there?

736
01:09:39,029 --> 01:09:40,525
Help me!

737
01:09:40,656 --> 01:09:43,149
Somebody help me!

738
01:09:49,415 --> 01:09:51,064
Something's happening.

739
01:09:51,209 --> 01:09:55,736
No. She's doing a performance art piece
to commemorate the massacre.

740
01:10:03,765 --> 01:10:05,031
Help me!

741
01:10:11,106 --> 01:10:13,483
Oh, my God!

742
01:10:13,692 --> 01:10:14,803
Please!

743
01:10:14,901 --> 01:10:17,433
She's good. I got chills.

744
01:10:46,936 --> 01:10:47,972
Somebody!

745
01:10:50,232 --> 01:10:51,573
Someone, please!

746
01:10:51,691 --> 01:10:54,300
Help! My God!

747
01:12:07,524 --> 01:12:09,173
Please, help me!

748
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:48,436
No!

749
01:12:49,903 --> 01:12:52,358
Please, I don't wanna die.

750
01:13:28,195 --> 01:13:30,496
Sasha's dead!
I just saw her and the killer.

751
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:32,155
All right.
Where did this happen?

752
01:13:32,284 --> 01:13:34,201
The radio station.

753
01:13:34,369 --> 01:13:36,746
Jesus. Come on.

754
01:13:36,955 --> 01:13:38,872
Why did you leave?

755
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,763
I thought I told you
to stay at the house.

756
01:13:42,002 --> 01:13:43,881
Oh, shit.

757
01:13:50,219 --> 01:13:52,174
- Where were you?
- Running all over campus.

758
01:13:52,346 --> 01:13:54,379
Trying to find help.
The dean is gone.

759
01:13:54,558 --> 01:13:56,859
I can't find Reese anywhere.

760
01:13:59,729 --> 01:14:01,149
It's dead.

761
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,433
Goddamn storm.

762
01:14:07,488 --> 01:14:09,251
We're gonna get the hell
out of here.

763
01:14:09,406 --> 01:14:12,283
Gotta get off campus
and find some help.

764
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:19,645
- What are you doing?
- I was just making sure the-

765
01:14:20,001 --> 01:14:21,651
I told you the phones were dead.

766
01:14:28,636 --> 01:14:30,209
I'm on your side.

767
01:14:32,182 --> 01:14:33,563
Let's get out of here.

768
01:14:35,476 --> 01:14:37,356
We'll go into town.
We'll find a phone.

769
01:14:42,359 --> 01:14:44,736
What's happening?
I heard Sasha on the radio.

770
01:14:44,945 --> 01:14:46,019
She's dead.

771
01:14:46,114 --> 01:14:47,455
Oh, my God.

772
01:14:47,573 --> 01:14:49,567
- Are you sure?
- We're out of here.

773
01:14:49,742 --> 01:14:51,160
What?

774
01:14:51,285 --> 01:14:52,858
Hello?

775
01:15:04,008 --> 01:15:05,695
Dean Adams...

776
01:15:05,844 --> 01:15:07,378
this is Reese.

777
01:15:08,972 --> 01:15:11,120
Hello? Are you there?

778
01:15:12,475 --> 01:15:15,122
You have my number. Use it.

779
01:15:33,707 --> 01:15:35,165
Do you smell something?

780
01:15:36,877 --> 01:15:37,596
No.

781
01:15:39,088 --> 01:15:42,387
We should stop at that gas station,
see if the phones work.

782
01:15:44,552 --> 01:15:45,895
Fine.

783
01:15:54,729 --> 01:15:56,187
Be right back.

784
01:16:05,951 --> 01:16:08,713
- Oh, it does reek in here.
- Yeah.

785
01:16:15,127 --> 01:16:17,314
I'm sorry that I acted
like such a jerk about you and Paul.

786
01:16:19,131 --> 01:16:21,355
You two like each other.

787
01:16:21,551 --> 01:16:23,392
Then you should be together.

788
01:17:03,055 --> 01:17:06,277
Like I said, he's all yours.

789
01:17:30,376 --> 01:17:32,524
- Where are we going?
- Back to campus.

790
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:18,603
Stop!

791
01:18:20,430 --> 01:18:21,926
- What's wrong?
- Someone's after me.

792
01:18:22,057 --> 01:18:23,629
Get in.

793
01:18:46,125 --> 01:18:48,005
- You okay?
- No.

794
01:18:49,211 --> 01:18:51,014
Got a coat right there.

795
01:19:04,019 --> 01:19:05,861
Ain't gonna bite ya.

796
01:19:10,652 --> 01:19:11,840
Just let me out here.

797
01:19:11,944 --> 01:19:13,287
What?

798
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:16,737
What are you doing?

799
01:19:17,785 --> 01:19:19,280
Please, just let me out.

800
01:19:19,411 --> 01:19:22,134
It won't open from the inside.

801
01:19:25,084 --> 01:19:26,120
Stop that!

802
01:19:27,712 --> 01:19:29,361
What's wrong with you?

803
01:19:37,055 --> 01:19:38,436
Idiot kids.

804
01:19:39,766 --> 01:19:40,486
No!

805
01:19:47,942 --> 01:19:48,863
It's him!

806
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:56,888
Keep going!

807
01:19:58,621 --> 01:19:59,580
Come on.

808
01:20:02,958 --> 01:20:04,569
Just keep going! Faster!

809
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:22,003
Hello? Is anybody there?

810
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,104
Help! Can you hear me?

811
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:30,216
- Hello?
- Somebody help me!

812
01:21:32,431 --> 01:21:33,774
Oh, God!

813
01:21:40,148 --> 01:21:42,066
Somebody help me!

814
01:22:08,262 --> 01:22:10,065
Somebody help me!

815
01:22:11,265 --> 01:22:13,796
He's gonna kill me!

816
01:22:28,701 --> 01:22:31,041
Please! Somebody help me!

817
01:22:45,135 --> 01:22:46,977
Please!

818
01:24:41,178 --> 01:24:43,096
Gotcha!

819
01:24:45,391 --> 01:24:47,231
I must say, Natalie...

820
01:24:47,393 --> 01:24:49,502
you have proved
your friendship to me...

821
01:24:49,687 --> 01:24:52,525
coming all the way out here
to rescue me...

822
01:24:52,774 --> 01:24:55,305
without even a little pepper spray
to defend yourself.

823
01:24:55,527 --> 01:24:57,099
Very endearing.

824
01:24:58,154 --> 01:24:59,381
Excuse me?

825
01:24:59,490 --> 01:25:02,175
I'm sorry, but I can't understand
a thing you're saying, doll.

826
01:25:05,746 --> 01:25:08,507
Now, if I remove the gag...

827
01:25:08,749 --> 01:25:10,513
you have got to promise me...

828
01:25:10,669 --> 01:25:12,778
that you won't scream.

829
01:25:12,963 --> 01:25:15,533
Lord knows I had
enough of that with Sasha.

830
01:25:20,303 --> 01:25:21,723
You're fucking crazy!

831
01:25:25,017 --> 01:25:26,841
I prefer the term "eccentric"...

832
01:25:28,164 --> 01:25:28,862
but...

833
01:25:29,671 --> 01:25:30,358
yeah...

834
01:25:31,101 --> 01:25:32,614
I guess you could say
I'm a little nutty.

835
01:25:33,222 --> 01:25:33,890
Why?

836
01:25:40,245 --> 01:25:42,205
You still haven't
figured it out, have you?

837
01:25:44,246 --> 01:25:45,683
Well, lucky for you, Miss Thang...

838
01:25:46,575 --> 01:25:47,533
I've got a visual aid.

839
01:25:51,486 --> 01:25:52,371
There I am...

840
01:25:53,994 --> 01:25:54,919
with my boyfriend...

841
01:25:56,012 --> 01:25:57,012
the love of my life.

842
01:25:59,087 --> 01:26:00,791
Have you found the love
of your life yet?

843
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:04,656
Course not.

844
01:26:05,283 --> 01:26:06,449
You're too self-involved to bother.

845
01:26:09,057 --> 01:26:10,866
Pic ring any bells?

846
01:26:16,945 --> 01:26:17,887
Oh, my God.

847
01:26:21,809 --> 01:26:23,127
His name was David Evans.

848
01:26:25,649 --> 01:26:28,507
The one you and your friend decided
to have a little fun with that night.

849
01:26:30,944 --> 01:26:32,036
David and I
were gonna get married...

850
01:26:32,619 --> 01:26:33,081
that summer...

851
01:26:33,746 --> 01:26:34,549
right after graduation.

852
01:26:38,472 --> 01:26:41,004
He didn't have enough money
to buy me a ring yet so...

853
01:26:42,518 --> 01:26:44,359
he got me this instead...

854
01:26:47,775 --> 01:26:49,922
the night you
took him away from me!

855
01:26:50,110 --> 01:26:52,219
Brenda, I wasn't-

856
01:26:52,404 --> 01:26:55,050
You weren't driving,
but it was your car...

857
01:26:55,283 --> 01:26:57,699
and you were there, Natalie!

858
01:27:00,329 --> 01:27:01,364
Now...

859
01:27:01,455 --> 01:27:02,720
didn't you tell me...

860
01:27:02,832 --> 01:27:05,900
that you were having
a little difficulty...

861
01:27:06,169 --> 01:27:07,704
forgiving yourself?

862
01:27:08,922 --> 01:27:09,957
I thought...

863
01:27:10,049 --> 01:27:11,621
as a friend...

864
01:27:11,759 --> 01:27:13,293
I could help you out
in that department.

865
01:27:16,973 --> 01:27:18,391
Payback's a bitch!

866
01:27:18,516 --> 01:27:20,011
Isn't it?

867
01:27:20,142 --> 01:27:22,098
Brenda, please,
you need to get help.

868
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:24,570
I have already tried therapy!

869
01:27:24,772 --> 01:27:27,265
Obviously, it did me no good.

870
01:27:27,484 --> 01:27:28,825
And I must say...

871
01:27:28,943 --> 01:27:31,091
I am kind of enjoying all this...

872
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:34,656
playing with your
pretty little head.

873
01:27:36,201 --> 01:27:38,771
You used an urban legend
to kill my boyfriend.

874
01:27:38,997 --> 01:27:40,377
And now-

875
01:27:40,498 --> 01:27:42,069
What are you gonna do?

876
01:27:42,208 --> 01:27:44,318
Oh, just my favorite U.L.

877
01:27:47,046 --> 01:27:48,504
The Kidney Heist.

878
01:27:51,719 --> 01:27:54,058
You do know this one, don't you?

879
01:27:54,263 --> 01:27:56,180
Guy gets picked up
by a woman at a bar.

880
01:27:56,349 --> 01:28:00,031
She takes him back to her hotel room.
Fixes him a drink. Boom! Knocked out.

881
01:28:00,353 --> 01:28:02,462
When he wakes up,
he's in a bathtub full of ice...

882
01:28:02,648 --> 01:28:05,026
and he realizes that one of his kidneys
has been removed.

883
01:28:06,485 --> 01:28:08,364
Supposedly they sell them
on the black market.

884
01:28:08,529 --> 01:28:10,639
I don't think
it's ever actually happened though.

885
01:28:11,991 --> 01:28:13,295
Till tonight.

886
01:28:31,428 --> 01:28:32,885
You won't get away with this.

887
01:28:33,014 --> 01:28:35,238
Natalie, of course I will.

888
01:28:35,433 --> 01:28:36,813
I've got the perfect murder...

889
01:28:36,935 --> 01:28:40,541
in the trunk of Paul's car.

890
01:28:41,231 --> 01:28:42,458
- You're sick.
- Professor...

891
01:28:42,566 --> 01:28:45,135
does away with his students,
then kills himself...

892
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:48,198
in the same manner
as the course he teaches.

893
01:28:48,447 --> 01:28:49,827
It's beautiful.

894
01:28:49,949 --> 01:28:52,250
It's so fucking clean, isn't it?

895
01:28:53,661 --> 01:28:56,767
Well, enough chat, Nat.
I'm sorry.

896
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,497
I don't have any anesthesia.

897
01:28:58,625 --> 01:29:01,271
I guess you'll just have to bite down
real hard on that gag...

898
01:29:01,503 --> 01:29:03,612
and hope that you go
into shock soon.

899
01:29:03,797 --> 01:29:04,948
Please, don't do this.

900
01:29:06,717 --> 01:29:08,749
Don't you wanna be
an urban legend?

901
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:10,730
All your friends are now.

902
01:29:14,475 --> 01:29:16,585
Ouch! Stupid bitch!

903
01:29:19,022 --> 01:29:21,784
I'm really going to enjoy
watching you bleed to death.

904
01:29:25,654 --> 01:29:27,649
Now, is this...

905
01:29:28,657 --> 01:29:29,615
your kidney?

906
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:32,078
Or is that the liver?

907
01:29:32,287 --> 01:29:34,587
I was always such a dope
in anatomy.

908
01:29:34,789 --> 01:29:36,553
Well, who cares, right?

909
01:29:36,708 --> 01:29:39,854
First organ I see,
I'm just gonna grab it.

910
01:29:45,885 --> 01:29:47,035
Drop the weapon!

911
01:29:48,554 --> 01:29:51,545
Oh, great.
Rent-A-Cop to the rescue.

912
01:29:51,808 --> 01:29:54,377
Put your hands up.
Get up against the wall.

913
01:29:54,602 --> 01:29:56,597
You loony psycho bitch.

914
01:29:58,314 --> 01:30:01,192
It's all right, sugar.
It's gonna be okay.

915
01:30:02,778 --> 01:30:04,006
Move it!

916
01:30:13,039 --> 01:30:14,497
Don't you move.

917
01:30:31,267 --> 01:30:33,223
Don't you fucking move.

918
01:30:34,187 --> 01:30:36,220
Shit. Bullet through the head.

919
01:30:36,398 --> 01:30:39,427
Not exactly an urban legend,
but in the essence of time.

920
01:30:39,693 --> 01:30:41,533
It's not gonna bring him back.

921
01:30:41,695 --> 01:30:43,843
I know that...

922
01:30:44,032 --> 01:30:46,678
but it will bring
a devastated little Paul...

923
01:30:46,910 --> 01:30:48,558
right into my arms.

924
01:30:48,703 --> 01:30:51,580
I'll have him,
and he'll have his Pulitzer.

925
01:30:53,125 --> 01:30:55,003
What did you think?

926
01:30:55,168 --> 01:30:57,777
I was gonna let you take
two men out of my life?

927
01:31:02,176 --> 01:31:03,288
Very well done.

928
01:31:05,931 --> 01:31:07,694
I couldn't have planned it
better myself.

929
01:31:07,849 --> 01:31:09,037
- Really?
- Yeah.

930
01:31:09,142 --> 01:31:11,635
I mean, I thought I was screwed
after Natalie...

931
01:31:11,853 --> 01:31:14,653
fucked it up for me
with the dean, but this-

932
01:31:16,650 --> 01:31:18,377
This is just what I need.

933
01:31:20,238 --> 01:31:21,964
A few things though.

934
01:31:22,824 --> 01:31:24,281
I'm listening.

935
01:31:24,409 --> 01:31:25,828
Well...

936
01:31:27,203 --> 01:31:28,276
I need some details...

937
01:31:28,371 --> 01:31:29,752
for my article.

938
01:31:31,208 --> 01:31:33,470
You know, about how Wexler
did each one.

939
01:31:33,669 --> 01:31:35,778
Details only you could give me.

940
01:31:35,963 --> 01:31:38,533
It would be great
for your career.

941
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:42,103
And we would be
so fucking hot together.

942
01:31:43,471 --> 01:31:46,118
And I'd be very grateful.

943
01:31:48,685 --> 01:31:51,369
So why don't you give me the gun.

944
01:31:51,604 --> 01:31:53,445
I'll take care of the rest.

945
01:31:53,607 --> 01:31:55,410
You're cute.

946
01:31:57,528 --> 01:31:59,139
But you're not that fucking cute.

947
01:32:00,364 --> 01:32:02,550
Now, which one of you...

948
01:32:02,742 --> 01:32:04,238
do I kill first?

949
01:32:17,342 --> 01:32:19,450
What, are you gonna shoot me?

950
01:32:19,635 --> 01:32:20,633
Huh?

951
01:32:22,013 --> 01:32:23,816
What kind of friend are you?

952
01:32:40,616 --> 01:32:42,380
Give me the gun.

953
01:32:42,535 --> 01:32:43,646
Come here.

954
01:32:43,744 --> 01:32:45,241
- You all right?
- No.

955
01:32:53,505 --> 01:32:55,729
Thought I'd have to wait
to be a cop...

956
01:32:55,925 --> 01:32:57,343
before a bullet ever hit me.

957
01:32:57,468 --> 01:32:58,887
Just stay down.

958
01:32:59,012 --> 01:33:01,582
- We're gonna go get some help.
- All right. Quick.

959
01:33:09,814 --> 01:33:11,156
Do you think Reese'll be okay?

960
01:33:11,275 --> 01:33:14,191
Reese is gonna be fine.
Paramedics are on the way.

961
01:33:20,868 --> 01:33:22,978
This'll become a legend,
too, you know.

962
01:33:24,707 --> 01:33:27,162
It'll change a little
from person to person, of course.

963
01:33:28,794 --> 01:33:30,559
Brenda will become a guy.

964
01:33:32,881 --> 01:33:34,416
You'll become a cop.

965
01:33:36,386 --> 01:33:39,300
And I'll end up
in some insane asylum.

966
01:33:39,555 --> 01:33:41,243
So if this is an urban legend...

967
01:33:43,394 --> 01:33:45,350
at what point
do we get to the twist?

968
01:35:06,567 --> 01:35:09,174
The river was such a mess
because of the storm...

969
01:35:09,403 --> 01:35:11,474
it washed away the body.

970
01:35:11,656 --> 01:35:13,381
The thing of it is...

971
01:35:13,533 --> 01:35:16,102
they never found a body.

972
01:35:16,327 --> 01:35:17,823
It wasn't there.

973
01:35:20,666 --> 01:35:22,468
- Bullshit.
- It's true.

974
01:35:22,626 --> 01:35:25,502
Happened right here at Ashton.
I swear to God.

975
01:35:25,755 --> 01:35:28,708
That is a stupid story you hear
at every campus in the northeast.

976
01:35:28,967 --> 01:35:31,191
Exactly.
I mean, where's your proof?

977
01:35:31,386 --> 01:35:34,492
Were you even listening?
It all keeps getting covered up.

978
01:35:34,764 --> 01:35:36,144
Think about it.

979
01:35:36,266 --> 01:35:38,183
Who would enroll at Murder U.?

980
01:35:38,352 --> 01:35:39,732
Yeah. And you know what?

981
01:35:39,853 --> 01:35:42,461
Natalie-
she's my old roommate's cousin.

982
01:35:42,690 --> 01:35:44,800
And Brenda's the girl
in that Noxzema commercial.

983
01:35:47,236 --> 01:35:49,115
Look, does anybody here
believe me?

984
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:50,623
- Not a chance.
- No.

985
01:35:52,701 --> 01:35:55,653
- I believe you.
- Thank you.

986
01:35:55,912 --> 01:35:58,175
But you didn't tell it right.

987
01:35:58,374 --> 01:36:00,406
I didn't?

988
01:36:00,584 --> 01:36:02,232
Not at all.

989
01:36:02,377 --> 01:36:04,410
Okay, listen up, guys...

990
01:36:04,589 --> 01:36:07,389
This is how the story really goes.
