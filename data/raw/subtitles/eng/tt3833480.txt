of his brain in my mouth.

1024
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:50,643
Yeah.

1025
00:45:52,277 --> 00:45:54,913
Yeah, I know, man.
That was, uh...

1026
00:45:54,947 --> 00:45:58,450
- It was bad.
- I'm a bad soldier, Sergeant.

1027
00:45:58,484 --> 00:46:01,253
- You know, my dad was right. I don't think I can...
- No, no, no, no.

1028
00:46:01,286 --> 00:46:03,522
You're a good soldier.

1029
00:46:03,555 --> 00:46:05,190
- You're a good soldier, Yunger.
- Don't fucking bull...

1030
00:46:05,224 --> 00:46:06,358
Don't bullshit me, man.

1031
00:46:06,392 --> 00:46:08,594
I'm not bullshitting you, okay?

1032
00:46:08,628 --> 00:46:11,397
I feel so fucked
up, Sergeant, man.

1033
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:13,465
- Sir, I feel so fucked up.
- [CASINGS CLATTER]

1034
00:46:14,266 --> 00:46:15,567
I know.

1035
00:46:15,601 --> 00:46:18,404
I know what you're
going through, okay?

1036
00:46:18,437 --> 00:46:21,373
The same thing
happened to me in Iraq.

1037
00:46:21,407 --> 00:46:24,276
I watched my best friend die.
A fucking sniper.

1038
00:46:25,043 --> 00:46:26,211
But, Yunger...

1039
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:30,382
Yunger, you listen to me.

1040
00:46:30,416 --> 00:46:32,584
I got a wife and kids
to come home to,

1041
00:46:32,618 --> 00:46:34,153
and I made them promises.

1042
00:46:36,021 --> 00:46:37,389
So I need you to make a choice.

1043
00:46:37,423 --> 00:46:39,391
You gotta get
your shit together,

1044
00:46:39,425 --> 00:46:41,093
or we're gonna
get you out of here.

1045

1046
00:46:43,763 --> 00:46:46,699
I'm fucking...
fucking trying, man.

1047
00:46:46,733 --> 00:46:48,233
- I just...
- Listen to me.

1048

SOLDIER: Sergeant!

1049
00:46:53,071 --> 00:46:55,174
Get him to the aid station.
We're gonna medevac him out.

1050
00:47:02,548 --> 00:47:04,416
- All right, guys, let's go.
- [HELICOPTER WHIRRING]

1051
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:09,154
Yunger, it's time to go.

1052
00:47:09,188 --> 00:47:10,690
We'll see you in a few months.

1053
00:47:16,528 --> 00:47:18,230
Don't let him touch the ground!

MAN: That's it? All on.

1055
00:47:35,715 --> 00:47:36,850
HESCOS are pretty beat up.

1056
00:47:36,883 --> 00:47:39,585
We got double-strand
concertina wire and trip flares

1057
00:47:39,618 --> 00:47:41,119
around the entire perimeter.

1058
00:47:41,153 --> 00:47:43,055
We're thinking about making
it triple-strand, sir.

1059
00:47:43,088 --> 00:47:44,490
And given all
the attacks here, sir

1060
00:47:44,523 --> 00:47:46,659
I really think we should
change our Claymore mines.

1061
00:47:46,693 --> 00:47:48,728
As I understand it, they've
been out there for over a year,

1062
00:47:48,761 --> 00:47:50,529
- and are probably ineffective...
- BROWARD: We'll get into all that later.

1063
00:47:50,562 --> 00:47:51,798
How many ANA here?

1064
00:47:51,831 --> 00:47:54,266
Uh, 80 on the payroll,
when they all show up,

1065
00:47:54,299 --> 00:47:55,467
which is never.

1066
00:47:55,501 --> 00:47:58,270
We get 20 at a time, at best.

1067
00:47:58,303 --> 00:47:59,571
BROWARD: Sort of what I thought.

1068
00:47:59,605 --> 00:48:01,540
- This the TOC?
- It is, sir.

1069
00:48:06,578 --> 00:48:08,146
New orders have come down.

1070
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:09,716
We're closing this outpost
come July.

1071
00:48:10,516 --> 00:48:11,784
SOLDIER: July, sir?

1072
00:48:11,818 --> 00:48:12,952
July 6th.

1073
00:48:12,986 --> 00:48:15,722
That's where I want you to
concentrate all your efforts,

1074
00:48:15,755 --> 00:48:17,489
- closing shop.
- Yes, sir.

1075
00:48:18,357 --> 00:48:19,826
Goodnight, gentlemen.

1076
00:48:19,859 --> 00:48:21,460
I'll see you in the morning.

1077
00:48:21,493 --> 00:48:23,128
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, sir.

1078
00:48:26,766 --> 00:48:28,233
July, huh?

1079
00:48:29,869 --> 00:48:31,169
Good night.

[URINATING]

1081
00:48:43,181 --> 00:48:44,249
Sir.

1082
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,588
What is this?

1083
00:48:49,621 --> 00:48:52,357
It's an Afghan
voter ID card, sir.

1084
00:48:52,391 --> 00:48:55,628
It was at the bridge where Captain
Yllescas was targ... targeted.

1085
00:48:55,662 --> 00:48:58,330
It most likely fell out of the prick's
pocket that killed our captain.

1086
00:48:59,164 --> 00:49:00,332
Tell him, Malak.

1087
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,402
I'm afraid it's true, sir.

1088
00:49:03,435 --> 00:49:05,504
I, uh, remember this man.

1089
00:49:05,537 --> 00:49:08,340
He was one of the workers
at the hydroelectric plant.

1090
00:49:09,842 --> 00:49:11,410
Somebody who we we're employing.

1091
00:49:11,443 --> 00:49:13,345
ROMESHA: We're not sure
which village he's in.

1092
00:49:13,378 --> 00:49:15,480
But I can saddle up
the men, find him.

1093
00:49:15,514 --> 00:49:17,416
Absolutely not.

1094
00:49:17,449 --> 00:49:20,352
The squadron has appointed
an investigating officer.

1095
00:49:20,385 --> 00:49:21,553
We will wait on him to get here.

1096
00:49:21,587 --> 00:49:24,423
Sir, by the time he gets here,
that suspect will be gone.

1097
00:49:24,456 --> 00:49:26,592
I am not gonna have
you guys antagonize

1098
00:49:26,626 --> 00:49:29,461
the population by rousing
families in the villages.

1099
00:49:29,494 --> 00:49:31,864
Colonel Spicer will have my ass.

1100
00:49:31,898 --> 00:49:34,199
With all due respect,
Captain Broward,

1101
00:49:34,232 --> 00:49:35,868
I think the Colonel
would appreciate it if...

1102
00:49:35,902 --> 00:49:41,139
What the Colonel would appreciate
is we do our jobs and properly,

1103
00:49:41,173 --> 00:49:42,875
especially since we're
outta here come July.

1104
00:49:44,343 --> 00:49:45,745
The man killed our commander.

1105
00:49:50,315 --> 00:49:51,383
I know.

1106
00:49:52,819 --> 00:49:54,353
Justice will be served,
Sergeant.

1107
00:49:56,188 --> 00:49:57,724
Let's get this
to the proper authorities.

1108

1109
00:49:59,792 --> 00:50:00,860
Okay?

1110
00:50:01,894 --> 00:50:03,261
Okay, sir.

1111
00:50:03,863 --> 00:50:05,130
Thank you.

00:50:07,532 --> 00:50:09,434
- Private.
- Sir.

1113
00:50:09,468 --> 00:50:10,837
Let's get this to the burn pit.

1114
00:50:11,603 --> 00:50:12,739
Yes, sir.

1115
00:50:13,438 --> 00:50:14,573
Aw, man.

1116
00:50:17,877 --> 00:50:19,244
- Thank you, sir.
- There you go.

00:50:19,277 --> 00:50:20,479

1118
00:50:20,512 --> 00:50:21,881
Take this.

1119
00:50:21,914 --> 00:50:23,883
I don't want anybody getting
malaria and spitting blood and shit.

1120
00:50:23,916 --> 00:50:25,718
- Hey, Scusa.
- I finished.

1121
00:50:25,752 --> 00:50:26,853
I finished my application.

1122
00:50:26,886 --> 00:50:28,453
Application for what?

1123
00:50:28,487 --> 00:50:29,922
This guy wants
to be an officer.

1124
00:50:29,956 --> 00:50:32,290
No, no. I wanna go
to flight school.

1125
00:50:32,324 --> 00:50:33,558
Flight school, Scusa?

1126
00:50:33,592 --> 00:50:35,293

hand out peanuts

00:50:36,696 --> 00:50:38,430

That's really nice of you.

- Hey, hey, hey.
- Goodbye, ladies.

1130
00:50:40,667 --> 00:50:43,201
You're gonna be a good pilot
and a good officer.

1131
00:50:43,235 --> 00:50:44,336
Thanks, Sergeant.

1132
00:50:44,369 --> 00:50:45,905
But I ain't calling
you "sir" ever.

Hey, it's all good, Sergeant.

00:50:47,305 --> 00:50:48,473
You can call me

- Morning, Sergeant.
- Morning, Sergeant.

- Not too bad.

00:51:17,569 --> 00:51:19,772
I'll show you what you do
with this Asian beef dicks.

identify target?

00:52:13,025 --> 00:52:14,761
Fucking PID.

- I see movement!
- Great.

Rules of engagement

1180
00:52:38,818 --> 00:52:41,286
You cannot shoot someone
for acting suspicious.

1181
00:52:41,888 --> 00:52:43,689
Suspicious?

1182
00:52:43,723 --> 00:52:46,491
So where were the bullets
coming from, sir?

1183
00:52:48,426 --> 00:52:52,564
You must PID a weapon
or a radio in an enemy's hand.

1184
00:52:52,597 --> 00:52:54,599
That comes straight
from McChrystal.

00:52:54,634 --> 00:52:56,501
You want your next tour
to be in Leavenworth?

1186
00:52:57,837 --> 00:52:59,371
Well, someone
should tell McChrystal

that we're not out here
selling popsicles, sir.

1188
00:53:04,543 --> 00:53:09,347
Excessive force alienates the
locals and causes greater risk.

1189
00:53:09,381 --> 00:53:11,851
You better grass that
fucking sentiment now.

1190
00:53:11,884 --> 00:53:15,487
Furthermore, who knows
when we'll be resupplied?

1191
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,923

2558
01:58:27,432 --> 01:58:29,001
Did not give us...
It did not give you

2559
01:58:29,035 --> 01:58:30,970
a very good sense of
"this is a safe place."

2560
01:58:31,003 --> 01:58:33,538
It gave me a quick
sense of impending doom,

2561
01:58:33,572 --> 01:58:35,041
that it was just
a matter of time

2562
01:58:35,074 --> 01:58:38,610
before a bad thing happens,
and... And we're gonna...

2563
01:58:38,644 --> 01:58:40,012
We'll be in trouble.

2564
01:58:40,046 --> 01:58:43,415
I remember when I first
landed at Keating.

2565
01:58:43,448 --> 01:58:45,885
Um, I got off the helicopter.

2566
01:58:45,918 --> 01:58:46,953
And when you got
off the helicopter,

2567
01:58:46,986 --> 01:58:48,487
you're supposed
to take a knee,

2568
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:50,957
'cause the propeller blades
create such a prop blast

2569
01:58:50,990 --> 01:58:53,291
that it, like, pushes you over.

2570
01:58:53,325 --> 01:58:56,361
But I was just, like, staring with
my mouth open, looking at the...

2571
01:58:56,394 --> 01:58:58,931
At all... Like, the mountains,
and just being in the valley,

2572
01:58:58,965 --> 01:58:59,899
and it was so strange.

2573
01:58:59,932 --> 01:59:02,635
I remember being down
in the middle of it,

2574
01:59:02,668 --> 01:59:04,971
and just looking
up, and up, and up.

2575
01:59:05,004 --> 01:59:09,407
And finally, I could see, like,
the top of... Of the...

2576
01:59:10,042 --> 01:59:12,011
The switchbacks.

2577
01:59:12,044 --> 01:59:14,546
And it was just like
that all the way around.

2578
01:59:14,579 --> 01:59:16,515
Being able to play myself is...

2579
01:59:16,548 --> 01:59:18,084
Is unique.
You know, it's a very...

2580
01:59:18,117 --> 01:59:21,654
I don't know if that happens
very often in this industry.

2581
01:59:21,687 --> 01:59:24,757
But as we were saying,
just the realness of here,

2582
01:59:24,791 --> 01:59:26,525
it's put me back
into that mindset,

2583
01:59:26,558 --> 01:59:29,762
and I've tried to embrace that,
you know, with the uniform

2584
01:59:29,796 --> 01:59:33,065
and, you know, the names of all
those soldiers that were lost,

2585
01:59:33,099 --> 01:59:34,767
that are still
walking around here,

2586
01:59:34,801 --> 01:59:36,535
you know, doing their role.

2587
01:59:36,568 --> 01:59:38,336
Um, I think it's special,
you know.

2588
01:59:38,370 --> 01:59:39,772
And to be able
to play myself,

2589
01:59:39,806 --> 01:59:42,041
I'm very grateful
that I'm still alive.

2590
01:59:42,074 --> 01:59:45,477
And it's almost
an obligation, I feel,

2591
01:59:45,510 --> 01:59:48,014
to bring authenticity
to this film.

2592
01:59:48,047 --> 01:59:53,485
At... At LRAS 2, five men
gave their lives to save mine.

2593
01:59:53,518 --> 01:59:56,454
They were either directly at
that position or supporting it.

2594
01:59:56,488 --> 01:59:58,724
And so when I wear the medal,
I think about them.

2595
01:59:58,758 --> 02:00:01,526
I also wear
the memorial bracelet,

2596
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:02,995
and in fact,

2597
02:00:03,029 --> 02:00:05,530
most people think
of Memorial Day

2598
02:00:05,564 --> 02:00:08,600
as a time to celebrate or...

2599
02:00:08,634 --> 02:00:11,704
Or have hot dogs,
but it's actually a very somber time,

2600
02:00:11,737 --> 02:00:16,976
to where we recognize what a lot
of men and women have died for.

2601
02:00:17,009 --> 02:00:19,979
When I came in with the QRF
down the switchbacks,

2602
02:00:20,012 --> 02:00:23,615
it was nighttime,
and you could see the flames

2603
02:00:23,649 --> 02:00:26,384
against the canyon walls.

2604
02:00:27,220 --> 02:00:31,824
Um, and in the flicker
of the flames

2605
02:00:31,858 --> 02:00:34,727
kind of dancing
on the canyon walls behind it,

2606
02:00:34,760 --> 02:00:37,964
and in the buildings
over the course of that night,

2607
02:00:37,997 --> 02:00:41,067
started... They were razed. I mean,
they started falling to the ground.

2608
02:00:41,100 --> 02:00:42,101
Yeah.

2609
02:00:43,102 --> 02:00:47,405
And I remember as I...
As I walked the outpost

2610
02:00:48,473 --> 02:00:50,009
when the battle was over,

2611
02:00:50,542 --> 02:00:51,978
and the buildings were

2612
02:00:52,011 --> 02:00:55,447
literally falling to the ground,
I would see,

2613
02:00:55,480 --> 02:01:00,920
um, black spots on the ground
that were dark as motor oil.

2614
02:01:00,953 --> 02:01:04,489
And then the flame,
the light of the flames

2615
02:01:04,522 --> 02:01:06,692
from the buildings
would kind of illuminate it,

2616
02:01:06,726 --> 02:01:10,663
just enough for me to see
that it was a very deep color

2617
02:01:10,696 --> 02:01:12,031
of red, and that's
when I realized,

2618
02:01:12,064 --> 02:01:16,168
"Oh, this is where...
This is where one of our soldiers died."

2619
02:01:16,202 --> 02:01:22,842
It's a very hard terrain
out in Nuristan.

2620
02:01:22,875 --> 02:01:25,878
It's incredibly difficult to...

2621
02:01:25,912 --> 02:01:28,915
To win a battle when you're
in the low ground like that.

2622
02:01:28,948 --> 02:01:30,515
It's... It's near impossible.

2623
02:01:30,548 --> 02:01:32,584
I mean, the only reason
it was possible for these guys

2624
02:01:32,617 --> 02:01:35,221
was because of some
very strong leadership,

2625
02:01:35,254 --> 02:01:37,757
uh, at the camp itself,

2626
02:01:37,790 --> 02:01:41,127
and because they had an
immense amount of air support,

2627
02:01:41,160 --> 02:01:44,063
um, once it finally came in.

2628
02:01:44,096 --> 02:01:47,532
I want people to know
about Stephan Mace.

2629
02:01:47,565 --> 02:01:50,636
I want, you know, more people
to know about Justin Gallegos

2630
02:01:50,670 --> 02:01:52,905
and the six others
who died that day.

2631
02:01:52,939 --> 02:01:55,540
Vernon Martin,
I knew him for...

2632
02:01:55,573 --> 02:01:57,575
For about three or four years.

2633
02:01:57,609 --> 02:01:59,178
Scusa, I knew him
for about three or four years

2634
02:01:59,211 --> 02:02:00,279
from our deployment
to Iraq together.

2635
02:02:00,313 --> 02:02:03,149
And so, I mean, these...
They were incredible people,

2636
02:02:03,182 --> 02:02:04,684
incredible humans.

2637
02:02:04,717 --> 02:02:09,487
Uh, that... I think
it's important

2638
02:02:09,521 --> 02:02:13,525
for more people to know
about these eight

2639
02:02:13,558 --> 02:02:14,894
that sacrificed themselves

2640
02:02:14,927 --> 02:02:16,762
and hopefully spark an interest
in learning more about

2641
02:02:16,796 --> 02:02:19,665
others that have
sacrificed themselves

2642
02:02:19,699 --> 02:02:22,702
for the greater good
of the United States' security.

2643
02:02:22,735 --> 02:02:24,536
In my own words,
I would describe

2644
02:02:24,569 --> 02:02:26,839
Combat Outpost Keating
as a...

2645
02:02:27,873 --> 02:02:28,941
I don't know.

2646
02:02:28,975 --> 02:02:32,645
I read somewhere in the Bible,
the gates of heaven

2647
02:02:32,678 --> 02:02:35,281
and the gates of hell
are in the same spot.

2648
02:02:35,314 --> 02:02:39,551
So at the time of the firefight,
this was the...

2649
02:02:39,584 --> 02:02:40,618
The gates of hell.

2650
02:02:40,653 --> 02:02:44,790
But watching men, you know,
sacrifice themselves

2651
02:02:44,824 --> 02:02:47,226
to protect each other,
you can see the true form

2652
02:02:47,259 --> 02:02:49,628
of what, uh,
brotherhood and love is.

2653
02:02:49,662 --> 02:02:51,831
And so therefore, it would be
the gates of heaven as well.

2654
02:02:53,032 --> 02:02:54,633
That's the best way
I can describe it.
