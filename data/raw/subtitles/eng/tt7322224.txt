aspects of being a male model?

5
00:00:52,595 --> 00:00:54,559
I would say: Look good.

6
00:00:54,561 --> 00:00:57,489
- (Laughing)
- Yes? And?

7
00:00:57,491 --> 00:01:00,014
- Er, that's it.
- (Man) And walk!

8
00:01:00,016 --> 00:01:03,457
Look good and walk?
But not at the same time, right?

9
00:01:03,459 --> 00:01:07,252
- Most of the times at
the same time.
- Really? Can you do that?

10
00:01:07,254 --> 00:01:11,465
- Er, sure.
- Please show us!
Yes, yes, go ahead.

11
00:01:11,467 --> 00:01:13,191

- Hey, there.
- What's up, man?

16
00:01:30,945 --> 00:01:34,452
So, I want to know, did
your parents support you
in being a male model?

17
00:01:34,454 --> 00:01:36,422
All the way, right
from the start.

18
00:01:36,424 --> 00:01:39,590
- Even your father?
- Even my father, yeah. Why?

19
00:01:39,592 --> 00:01:43,428
He wanted you to enter
this industry where you earn
only 1/3 of the women,

20
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,825
where you constantly have
to maneuver homosexual men

21
00:01:45,827 --> 00:01:47,926
who want to sleep with you?

22
00:01:54,089 --> 00:01:55,591

23
00:01:55,803 --> 00:01:58,837
'I'm Lewis Taylor, and
I'm standing here with
my very best friend...'

24
00:01:58,839 --> 00:02:00,608
- what was your name?
- Er, Carl.

25
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,938
My best friend Carl!

26
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,679
- How are you today, Carl?
- Yeah, good, good.

27
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:09,011
So, is this runway casting for a
grumpy brand or a smiley brand?

28
00:02:09,013 --> 00:02:11,520
Er, I don't know,
man. I don't know.

29
00:02:11,522 --> 00:02:14,181
Well, smiley brands
are the cheap ones,

30
00:02:14,183 --> 00:02:16,656
and the more expensive
the brand gets,

31
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:19,186
you start to look down
on your consumer.

32
00:02:19,188 --> 00:02:22,530
Like, if you want to be a
part of this "von oben"
one-man in-crowd,

33
00:02:22,532 --> 00:02:24,697
you have to show us
some serious cash.

34
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:28,700
- So it's a grumpy brand, yeah?
- Congratulations! I'm so
happy for you!

35
00:02:28,702 --> 00:02:31,703
And if you get the job, you will
get to wear exclusive clothing,

36
00:02:31,705 --> 00:02:34,035
and look down on your consumer.

37
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:36,168
Okay, Carl. Show us some
of that grumpy look.

38
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,841

00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:09,234
No, I didn't. I didn't see it.

171
00:12:09,236 --> 00:12:12,698
Or I didn't notice it. We were
just having a nice dinner.

172
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:18,373
You didn't see the bill
when it got put on the table?

173
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,440
No, I didn't, Carl.

174
00:12:27,845 --> 00:12:30,746
So the waiter came in, and
put it in the middle of
the table just there.

175
00:12:30,748 --> 00:12:33,585
- And you didn't
happen to see it?
- Oh, my god!

176
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:37,720
What? I'm asking you
seriously now, because...

177
00:12:37,722 --> 00:12:39,194
Wow...

178
00:12:39,955 --> 00:12:41,922
What's... what's "wow"?

179
00:12:41,924 --> 00:12:43,461
(Chair moves)

180
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,034
(Yaya sighs heavily)

181
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,301
What are you doing?

182
00:12:48,303 --> 00:12:51,897
No, no, no. Just don't... wait.
Can you sit down? Sit down.

183
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:55,438
I'm just trying to figure out
what exactly I did wrong!

184
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,970
- Seriously?
- Calm down. Please,
just sit down.

185
00:12:59,972 --> 00:13:03,776
- You're fighting over money!
- No! That's not what's...

186
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:05,745
- That's literally
what's happening.

187
00:13:05,747 --> 00:13:07,647
- I'm just pointing
out the fact that...

188
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:09,979
- Why are you so
obsessed with money?
- I'm not obsessed.

189
00:13:09,981 --> 00:13:13,323
Can you just sit down, please?
I'm not obsessed with money.

190
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:16,853
It was just an
observation from yesterday.
Can you please sit down?

191
00:13:27,931 --> 00:13:30,668
- No, no, no... what
are you doing?
- It's fine.

192
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,771
Well, you can't pay now,
that's ridiculous.

193
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,312
- Don't, Carl.
- What are you doing?

194
00:13:38,314 --> 00:13:41,117
- Let go.
- No, no, no... i'm
paying the bill.

195
00:13:41,985 --> 00:13:44,779
- That's not why I said it.
- (Bangs table)

196
00:13:47,223 --> 00:13:51,026
- Sorry.
- (Waiter) Are we
enjoying ourselves?

197
00:13:51,853 --> 00:13:54,920
Yes, thanks, yeah.
Yaya...

198
00:13:54,922 --> 00:13:57,263
- (Waiter) Thank you very much.
- (Yaya) Thank you.

199
00:14:12,475 --> 00:14:14,475
Now I feel bad.

200
00:14:14,477 --> 00:14:17,115
Why? I make more money than you.

201
00:14:25,718 --> 00:14:27,883
(Footsteps approach)

202
00:14:27,885 --> 00:14:31,952
(Waiter) Excuse me.
Your card didn't work.

203
00:14:33,121 --> 00:14:36,494
- Do you have
another one, maybe?
- Can you try it again, please?

204
00:14:36,496 --> 00:14:39,728
- (Waiter) I tried it twice.
- (Mutters)

205
00:14:41,996 --> 00:14:44,897
- I'm sorry, we don't
accept that one.
- (Carl) Just take this one.

206
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:47,208
Carl! Just give me a second.
Just wait!

207
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,276
- (Carl) Let me pay.
- Just wait!

208
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:50,771
(Coins tumbling)

209
00:14:53,908 --> 00:14:56,512
It's fine, you don't have
enough cash. Take that.

210
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:59,614
- You accept that one, yeah?
- Yes.

211
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:02,386
- Thank you.
- Thanks so much.

212
00:15:05,985 --> 00:15:07,259
(Mutters)

213
00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:34,190
Thank you.

214
00:16:00,144 --> 00:16:02,045
(Yaya's phone beeps)

215
00:16:04,226 --> 00:16:06,116
(Tapping phone keyboard)

216
00:16:16,503 --> 00:16:21,407
I do think it's quite crazy
how it's such a hard
thing to talk about.

217
00:16:22,543 --> 00:16:24,103
Money.

218
00:16:26,349 --> 00:16:30,517
It's such a touchy subject.
Don't you think?

219
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:33,618
Yeah, I think it's UN-sexy
to talk about money.

220
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:42,188
Okay, but then why is that?

221
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,928
I don't know,
it's just not sexy.

222
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:48,371
Well, you don't think
it's because it's so
tied to gender roles?

223
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:52,771
Fuckin' hell, the menu
in the restaurant didn't
even have prices for you.

224
00:16:52,773 --> 00:16:54,839
That's not fair, Carl.

225
00:16:54,841 --> 00:16:59,042
- I'm always paying.
- No, no, no, let's take
you out of it here.

226
00:16:59,044 --> 00:17:01,715
And just talk about
women in general.

227
00:17:02,684 --> 00:17:06,359
I'm a generous person, Carl.
Ask any of my friends.

228
00:17:08,054 --> 00:17:10,595
Sure you're generous, but...

229
00:17:14,028 --> 00:17:15,401
But?

230
00:17:16,999 --> 00:17:20,275
When it comes to you and
me, we're dealing with
roles that I hate.

231
00:17:20,277 --> 00:17:22,705
I don't want to be the man,
whilst you're the woman,

232
00:17:22,707 --> 00:17:24,708
I want us to be best friends.

233
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,843
- I don't wanna sleep with
my best friend.
- No, that's not...

234
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:30,946
You don't understand what
I'm trying to say. I mean...

235
00:17:30,948 --> 00:17:33,587
We shouldn't just slip into the
stereotypical gender-based roles

236
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:36,017
that everyone else
seems to be doing.

237
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:42,530
I want us to be equal.

238
00:17:45,404 --> 00:17:47,063
(Car door closes)

239
00:17:48,605 --> 00:17:50,342
(Carl sighs heavily)

240
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,447
(Driver) Excuse me?

241
00:17:56,449 --> 00:17:59,417
- You have to fight.
- I'm sorry, what?

242
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:02,277
If you love her, you
have to fight for her.

243
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:04,115
I've been there, I know.

244
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:07,118
If you don't fight,
you're gonna be her slave.

245
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:13,124
The thing is, yaya, I like
to take you for dinner.
I enjoy paying for you.

246
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:16,127
But there comes a point
where I do feel used.

247
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,406
I use you?

248
00:18:18,408 --> 00:18:21,133
Well, I'm just referring to my
feelings now, but sure, if we...

249
00:18:21,135 --> 00:18:23,774
No, no. Just wait. If we go
back the last week or so,

250
00:18:23,776 --> 00:18:26,073
then, yeah, maybe
there is a point...

251
00:18:26,075 --> 00:18:27,778
Are you being serious?

252
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,978
I got you this shirt.
I invited you for dinner.

253
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:33,653
- You're staying at my hotel.
- Well, you got this
shirt for free.

254
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:35,918
- And actually you didn't
pay for dinner.

255
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,921
- That's because my
card didn't work.

256
00:18:37,923 --> 00:18:41,155
There's a cash machine
in the lobby. I'll pay you
back every last cent...

257
00:18:41,157 --> 00:18:43,124
It's okay.

258
00:18:43,126 --> 00:18:44,995
Carl, I always intended
to pay you back.

259
00:18:44,997 --> 00:18:49,263
I didn't realize you
wanted the money right
now before going to bed.

260
00:18:51,037 --> 00:18:53,906
- So your intention
was to pay me back?
- Yes.

261
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,612
- Really?
- Yeah.

262
00:18:56,614 --> 00:18:59,275
So why did you take
the 50-euro bill?

263
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:04,281
Once I realized you didn't have
enough cash, I paid the bill.

264
00:19:04,283 --> 00:19:08,086
Instead of giving
me the 50-euro bill, you put
it back in your purse.

265
00:19:09,353 --> 00:19:11,959
What? I'm just saying
what happened, yaya.

266
00:19:12,863 --> 00:19:14,599
What are you...? Don't!

267
00:19:16,702 --> 00:19:19,264
What the fuck are you doing?

268
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:21,804
Don't fucking do that to me!

269
00:19:21,806 --> 00:19:25,039
Don't... fucking do
that to me, yaya!

270
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,614
Don't do that to me!

271
00:19:27,616 --> 00:19:30,618
- 'Going down.'
- Don't fucking shove
things down me!

272
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,212
- You fucking child!
- Seriously...

273
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:33,455
You're behaving like
a crazy person.

274
00:19:33,457 --> 00:19:35,314
Shut up!
Don't do things like that to me!

275
00:19:35,316 --> 00:19:37,053
What the hell are you doing
with my money?

276
00:19:37,055 --> 00:19:40,727
Your money? Oh, my god!
It's not about money, yaya!

277
00:19:40,729 --> 00:19:42,256
It's not about...

278
00:19:42,258 --> 00:19:43,829
(Banging)

279
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:45,326
(Yaya laughs)

280
00:19:45,328 --> 00:19:47,570
It's not about the
fucking money, yaya!

281
00:19:47,572 --> 00:19:49,440
- Oh!
- This is... no, it's not!

282
00:19:49,442 --> 00:19:52,268
You're not understanding the
point! It's not about the money!

283
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,973
I'll give you that 50 Euros!
I'll give you a 100 Euros!

284
00:19:54,975 --> 00:19:57,174
- Oh, yeah?
- No! I'm serious now!

285
00:19:57,176 --> 00:19:59,979
This is not about
the fucking money! Why won't
you understand it?

286
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:02,245
Understand my point!

287
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:05,083
This is not about the money!

288
00:20:05,085 --> 00:20:09,185
- Oh, my god. Okay, okay.
- I want it to be equal, yaya!

289
00:20:10,694 --> 00:20:14,024
(Man) Thought he might
be dangerous, but he
just looked like...

290
00:20:18,471 --> 00:20:20,570
(Carl) Bullshit feminist.

291
00:21:15,313 --> 00:21:17,515
<i>(Answering message) The person
you're trying to reach...</i>

292
00:21:25,322 --> 00:21:27,421
(Muffled voices and laughter)

293
00:21:45,747 --> 00:21:47,747
(Mutters) For fuck's...

294
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:02,221
(Door closes)

295
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:21,436
- What have you been doing?
- Trying to sleep on a chair.

296
00:22:21,438 --> 00:22:24,505
- How'd that go?
- Well, I'm back.

297
00:22:26,752 --> 00:22:29,048
What have you been doing?

298
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:32,281
I was... walking up and down
the corridor and...

299
00:22:33,383 --> 00:22:36,087
- Texting you multiple times.
- Hmm, a lot...

300
00:22:36,892 --> 00:22:39,321
- You saw them?
- (Giggles) Yeah.

301
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,702
- This is so silly.
- Yeah.

302
00:22:49,331 --> 00:22:52,233
I'm... so good at being...

303
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:54,532
Manipulative.

304
00:22:56,503 --> 00:23:00,373
I don't know, I do it
and I don't even realize
that I'm doing it.

305
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:03,541
- Yeah...
- I love you.

306
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:08,512
No, but seriously, it's amazing
that you can tell me that.

307
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:10,591
Now you're a generous person.

308
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,693
Okay.

309
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,288
Alright.

310
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,768
Ask me anything.

311
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,594
You sure?

312
00:23:26,596 --> 00:23:27,969
Uh-huh.

313
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,601
In the restaurant,
with the bill...

314
00:23:33,603 --> 00:23:35,570
What about it?

315
00:23:35,572 --> 00:23:38,749
You intentionally
didn't pick that up, right?

316
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,475
- Yes.
- Of course.

317
00:23:42,082 --> 00:23:44,017
(Yaya clears throat)

318
00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:46,447
Didn't that embarrass you?

319
00:23:47,417 --> 00:23:48,889
Nope.

320
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:52,959
- But you make more
money than I do.
- It's not about the money.

321
00:23:52,961 --> 00:23:55,059
And you said you
were gonna pay...

322
00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:04,628
It doesn't really matter
who makes more money.

323
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,840
What is it about, then?

324
00:24:08,106 --> 00:24:09,710
What if I...

325
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,570
Fall pregnant?

326
00:24:12,572 --> 00:24:14,076
With me?

327
00:24:15,443 --> 00:24:20,147
What if I fall pregnant
and I can't go on working?

328
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:23,723
I need to know that
the person I'm with intends
to take care of me.

329
00:24:23,725 --> 00:24:25,824
Otherwise I'm wasting my time.

330
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,830
Yeah, I guess you're not
the kind to work in...

331
00:24:32,832 --> 00:24:35,326
A restaurant
or a supermarket, are you?

332
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,526
- (Yaya laughs)
- No offense.

333
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:40,628
I'm a model, honey, the only way
for me to get out of this life

334
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:43,774
is to become
someone's trophy wife.

335
00:24:45,304 --> 00:24:48,075
So, there's nothing
else to this for you?

336
00:24:49,341 --> 00:24:50,781
Other than...

337
00:24:51,516 --> 00:24:55,509
Increasing the followers on
our Instagram, and all of that.

338
00:24:55,511 --> 00:24:58,018
- It make sense, doesn't it?
- Sure.

339
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,888
I like you. You like me.
It's good for business.

340
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,252
Yeah.

341
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:05,123
- Nothing more?
- Uh-hmm.

342
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:07,027
- Uh-hmm?
- Uh-hmm.

343
00:25:09,195 --> 00:25:11,494
I'd like to put a bet on that.

344
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:13,936
Okay.

345
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:16,774
- Deal.
- Yeah.

346
00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:22,373
We'll see.

347
00:25:23,574 --> 00:25:25,674
I'll make you love me.

348
00:25:27,084 --> 00:25:29,381
- It'll be real love as well.
- Oh, yeah?

349
00:25:29,383 --> 00:25:31,647
- Yep.
- Okay.

350
00:25:31,649 --> 00:25:34,287
You'll forget about
this trophy shit.

351
00:25:34,289 --> 00:25:35,894
And you'll love me.

352
00:25:35,896 --> 00:25:37,389
(Both laughing)

353
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:36,521
(Woman) 'The success of a
luxury cruise mainly
depends on two moments.

354
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:41,130
'Number one: The first hours
the guests are onboard.

355
00:26:42,032 --> 00:26:45,168
'And number two: The last day
the guests are onboard.

356
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:48,875
'And if we can impress them
on those two occasions,

357
00:26:48,877 --> 00:26:51,736
'then the cruise will probably
be a success.'

358
00:26:52,849 --> 00:26:54,805
and I don't want to hear
anybody saying,

359
00:26:54,807 --> 00:26:59,447
"we don't need to uncover
the sundeck, they all leave
after breakfast."

360
00:26:59,449 --> 00:27:03,517
No. I want full set-up
every morning.

361
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:05,091
No excuses.

362
00:27:05,995 --> 00:27:08,193
Not even for the last hour.

363
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:13,166
It's always,
"yes, sir! Yes, ma'am!"

364
00:27:13,168 --> 00:27:15,596
If there is an illegal substance
they want, or...

365
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,171
A unicorn!

366
00:27:18,173 --> 00:27:20,503
"Yes, sir! Yes, ma'am!"

367
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,143
- Yes!
- Whoo!

368
00:27:23,343 --> 00:27:24,639
Yes!

369
00:27:26,347 --> 00:27:29,051
I know, I know what it is
to work for service.

370
00:27:29,053 --> 00:27:31,647
I know all the challenges
you're facing.

371
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:36,520
But at these times, I ask of you
to keep that chin up.

372
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:40,229
- Stay strong.
- (Slow handclapping)

373
00:27:40,231 --> 00:27:42,792
And try to remind yourself...

374
00:27:44,531 --> 00:27:46,906
If everything goes well...

375
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:50,503
At the end of the cruise...

376
00:27:50,505 --> 00:27:53,044
- Money, money, money...
- You might be getting...

377
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:57,544
- A very generous tip!
- Money, money, money...

378
00:28:02,189 --> 00:28:05,058
(Muffled) Money! Money! Money!

379
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,622
Money! Money!
Money! Money! Money!

380
00:28:08,624 --> 00:28:10,525
(Screaming and cheering)

381
00:28:16,633 --> 00:28:18,501
- Money!
- (All) Yes!

382
00:28:18,503 --> 00:28:21,042
Alicia, who do we have onboard?

383
00:28:22,904 --> 00:28:24,441
(Knocking)

384
00:28:24,443 --> 00:28:25,872
No...

385
00:28:28,052 --> 00:28:29,678
(Knocking)

386
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,055
- (Woman) Housekeeping!
- No. No, thank you.

387
00:28:34,257 --> 00:28:36,884
- Do you want me
to clean the room?
- No, thanks.

388
00:28:36,886 --> 00:28:39,162
Okay, I'll come
back in 30 minutes?

389
00:28:39,164 --> 00:28:42,164
- No, you can come
back a bit later.
- Okay, one hour?

390
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:44,596
(Yaya) Could you just
come back later, please?

391
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:47,731
Okay, I'll come back later.
Sorry, ma'am.

392
00:28:56,577 --> 00:28:58,545
(Yaya) Let me change.

393
00:29:05,126 --> 00:29:07,555

(Distant laughter
and conversation)

395
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:53,484
(Men speaking Greek) - Hey there!
- Hey!

396
00:29:53,485 --> 00:29:55,517
- Mario the red, how are you?
- Yes, all good!

397
00:29:55,767 --> 00:29:59,146
Great, guys!
Let's greet the rich!

398
00:30:05,945 --> 00:30:08,198
Make it shine man,
make it shine!

399
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:10,450
Make it shine...

400
00:30:11,331 --> 00:30:13,198
What?

401
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,594
Nothing.

402
00:30:19,468 --> 00:30:21,204
- Hey!
- (Yaya) Hey.

403
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,276
- What are you doing?
- What?

404
00:30:32,477 --> 00:30:35,313
- Are you talking to the crew?
- Yeah...

405
00:30:36,214 --> 00:30:39,975
- Why are you
talking to the crew?
- I said hello.

406
00:30:39,977 --> 00:30:42,383
Yeah, you smiled at him
and said hello.

407
00:30:43,386 --> 00:30:45,452
- So?
- Ah...

408
00:30:48,489 --> 00:30:50,620
(Crew speaking Greek)

409
00:30:52,557 --> 00:30:54,063
(Camera clicks)

410
00:30:56,957 --> 00:30:59,825
Seriously, yaya, we're sitting
here together, you shouldn't...

411
00:30:59,827 --> 00:31:02,496
- You just don't do that.
- Do what?

412
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:08,237
If I started smiling
at the hot stewardess and...

413
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:10,305
- You know...
- You think she's hot?

414
00:31:12,275 --> 00:31:16,572
No, but if she was,
and I started smiling at her,

415
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:19,146
and giggling and saying,
"hey," like you did,

416
00:31:19,148 --> 00:31:21,213
then you wouldn't
like it, would you?

417
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:24,072
- Are you jealous?
- No.

418
00:31:24,074 --> 00:31:27,008
- No?
- No, I'm not. I'm not.
It's just like...

419
00:31:28,847 --> 00:31:30,912
I mean, come on, look at you.
And then...

420
00:31:31,614 --> 00:31:34,585
And then a hot guy turns up.
I mean, he shouldn't be...

421
00:31:34,587 --> 00:31:36,488
Do you think he's hot?

422
00:31:37,491 --> 00:31:38,984
He's alright.

423
00:31:40,624 --> 00:31:42,360
- Do you?
- Yeah!

424
00:31:43,196 --> 00:31:46,429
- What the fuck, man?
- You just said you thought
he was hot!

425
00:31:46,431 --> 00:31:50,563
But come on, you don't
have to... you said it
very quickly. Jesus!

426
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,269
Drop it, okay?

427
00:31:54,804 --> 00:31:57,404
(Crew speaking
Greek and laughing)

428
00:32:32,497 --> 00:32:33,792
(Sighs)

429
00:32:45,736 --> 00:32:47,868
Can I help you, sir?

430
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,935
- Sorry, just quickly...
- Yes?

431
00:32:49,937 --> 00:32:53,102
I was on the rear deck, and one
of your crew members was...

432
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,806
- Bare-chested.
- Really?

433
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:56,643
Yeah, and like
smoking and stuff.

434
00:32:56,645 --> 00:32:58,776
Oh, I'm so sorry.
That's so inappropriate.

435
00:32:58,778 --> 00:33:01,613
- Yeah, it did feel
a little bit...
- No, of course.

436
00:33:01,615 --> 00:33:03,483
I'll take care of
that. I'm so sorry.

437
00:33:03,485 --> 00:33:06,144
- Maybe it's not a big issue...
- No, but it's not
acceptable here.

438
00:33:06,146 --> 00:33:09,323
I thought I'd just let you know,
cos... yeah, I didn't
wanna make anything of it.

439
00:33:09,325 --> 00:33:11,489
Well, thank you so much.
It won't happen again, sir.

440
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:13,557
- I promise you that.
- Alright, thanks.

441
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:16,328
- Alicia?
- Yeah?

442
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:19,463
There's a crew member
up on deck with no shirt on.

443
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:20,859
- No shirt on?
- Yes.

444
00:33:20,861 --> 00:33:22,333
(Banging)

445
00:33:22,335 --> 00:33:24,125
(Carl sighs heavily)

446
00:33:25,831 --> 00:33:27,698
(Carl clears throat)

447
00:33:30,834 --> 00:33:32,735
Sorry. Just, er...

448
00:33:32,737 --> 00:33:34,000
Yes?

449
00:33:34,002 --> 00:33:38,035
Is it possible to look
at the engagement rings?

450
00:33:38,037 --> 00:33:40,740
- Yes. Yes, of course!
- Is that alright?

451
00:33:40,742 --> 00:33:44,172
Definitely, yes. Okay.

452
00:33:44,174 --> 00:33:47,811
This is a beautiful ring.
This is 24-carat gold.

453
00:33:47,813 --> 00:33:50,286
And we have a point nine
diamond in the middle,

454
00:33:50,288 --> 00:33:54,080
and we have four brilliants
on every side of the band.

455
00:33:54,082 --> 00:33:57,489
- It's a very beautiful ring.
- Yes. It's really nice.

456
00:33:57,491 --> 00:34:00,326
Do you want me to try it on
so you can see it on a hand?

457
00:34:00,328 --> 00:34:01,854
- Oh, okay, yeah.
- Yeah?

458
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:04,087
- If you don't mind?
- No, of course.

459
00:34:07,465 --> 00:34:08,727
Hmm...

460
00:34:13,732 --> 00:34:15,336
Yeah?

461
00:34:15,338 --> 00:34:18,405
It's a very nice diamond, this
one. It's a flawless diamond.

462
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,802
What was the price of that one?

463
00:34:21,804 --> 00:34:25,003
This one is... 28,000 Euros.

464
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,643
Mm-hmm...

465
00:34:35,914 --> 00:34:38,914

almond latte to foredeck?'

466

467
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:54,760
(Knocking)
Captain?

468
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:00,226
(Captain) Uh, yes?

469
00:35:00,228 --> 00:35:03,866
I just wanted to tell you
it's time for the safety drill.

470
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:05,901
(Captain) Uh, well, no, i'm...

471
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:08,136
I'm just not feeling well.

472
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:12,911
- Should I get the doctor?
- No, no, I'll be fine.

473
00:35:12,913 --> 00:35:16,290
Just have the first take
care of it, and then...

474
00:35:16,925 --> 00:35:19,118
You know, I'll see you later.

475
00:35:20,759 --> 00:35:22,562
Okay!

476
00:35:22,564 --> 00:35:24,334
- Okay.
- Okay.

477
00:35:27,868 --> 00:35:31,068
Abigail? Could you get the tray?
Thank you.

478

- Honey, Nutella.

481
00:35:42,284 --> 00:35:43,690
Hm-mm...

482
00:35:44,595 --> 00:35:46,298
Another one?

483
00:35:52,132 --> 00:35:54,067
Have a little look.

484
00:35:57,007 --> 00:36:00,483
- (Man) Aren't you going
to eat the pasta?
- Sorry?

485
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,248
Aren't you going
to eat the pasta?

486
00:36:06,757 --> 00:36:10,023
Oh, er...
No. I'm gluten intolerant.

487
00:36:10,025 --> 00:36:11,366
(Man) Oh?

488
00:36:11,368 --> 00:36:14,733
It's just for the pictures.
She's an influencer.

489
00:36:14,735 --> 00:36:16,670
- (Woman) Oh!
- (Man) Okay.

490
00:36:16,672 --> 00:36:18,133
(Woman 2) Wow!

491
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,677
(Man) You make money from that?

492
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:25,781
- Champagne, sir?
- Nah... white wine.

493
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:29,786
- Sorry, what?
- Yeah... it depends.

494
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:33,858
It depends. You mostly get
free stuff, to be honest.

495
00:36:34,697 --> 00:36:36,829
We got this cruise for free.

496
00:36:38,295 --> 00:36:42,804
Good! Her looks paid for
the tickets. Not bad, huh?

497
00:36:44,545 --> 00:36:47,877
- Good, huh?
- I guess so, yeah. It did.

498
00:36:47,879 --> 00:36:50,452
- (Woman) A lovely couple, huh?
- (Man) Yeah, that's nice.

499
00:36:50,454 --> 00:36:53,556
- Not bad, not bad.
- (Yaya) Thank you.

500
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:58,222
So, what do you do?

501
00:36:59,357 --> 00:37:01,567
I sell shit.

502
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,933
- What, sorry?
- I sell shit!

503
00:37:07,071 --> 00:37:11,613
- (Chuckles) Fertilizer
for agriculture.
- Oh, fertilizer...

504
00:37:12,684 --> 00:37:15,586
- Interesting.
- In every business it's
the right place...

505
00:37:15,588 --> 00:37:18,723
In the right moment.
My right place: East Europe.

506
00:37:18,725 --> 00:37:22,497
Right moment: End of 80s,
beginning of 90s.

507
00:37:22,499 --> 00:37:24,026
And, er...

508
00:37:24,028 --> 00:37:26,864
So, business start, yeah?

509
00:37:26,866 --> 00:37:30,332
- In 80s, I was...
- Baby? Can I have this one?

510
00:37:30,334 --> 00:37:32,070
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

511
00:37:32,072 --> 00:37:33,777
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

512
00:37:33,779 --> 00:37:35,372
- Yeah.
- Love you.

513
00:37:35,374 --> 00:37:39,146
Yeah, yeah...
So, in the beginning of 80s,

514
00:37:39,148 --> 00:37:42,083
I was only ceo

515
00:37:42,085 --> 00:37:46,420
in one agriculture "kombinat",
we called it.

516
00:37:46,422 --> 00:37:50,635
Hundred thousand pigs,
two million chickens.

517
00:37:50,637 --> 00:37:54,607
And we're getting
some kind of monopoly.

518
00:37:54,609 --> 00:37:57,545
You can call me the
king of the shit!

519
00:37:57,547 --> 00:38:00,043
- It was...
- I love him. I love him!

520
00:38:00,045 --> 00:38:02,111
And when you have money,
you know,

521
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,479
you don't leave money to sleep,
you understand?

522
00:38:05,481 --> 00:38:08,185
- Money must not
sleep, you know.
- Okay.

523
00:38:08,187 --> 00:38:12,158
So you put this money
from this business,

524
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,538
because factories
shutting down...

525
00:38:18,499 --> 00:38:21,072
(Man) And the
desert is tiramisu.

526
00:38:21,641 --> 00:38:24,440
Or panna cotta, you
like both of those.

527
00:38:27,148 --> 00:38:30,558
- (Woman) Oh... you choose.
- (Man) A-ha...

528
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,354
You have the panna cotta,
I'll have a tiramisu.

529
00:38:34,356 --> 00:38:35,829
(Woman) Fine.

530
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:41,573
Hello!

531
00:38:45,713 --> 00:38:47,140
Cheers.

532
00:38:52,447 --> 00:38:57,320
I'm Clementine.
And this is my husband, Winston.

533
00:38:57,322 --> 00:38:59,388
We're from Great Britain.

534
00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:14,879

535
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,715
Nein, nein...

536
00:39:15,754 --> 00:39:17,887

my husband, Winston.

537
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:19,344
We're from Great Britain.

538
00:39:19,345 --> 00:39:20,388
Nein.

539
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:23,588
Uli, in den wolken.

540
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:26,800
(Uli) Hello. This is
my wife, therese.

541
00:39:26,802 --> 00:39:30,332
She understands you perfectly,
but my wife had a stroke.

542
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:33,777
Since then, she's suffering
from a disability of speaking.

543
00:39:34,714 --> 00:39:36,440
(Therese)
In den wolken.

544
00:39:37,412 --> 00:39:38,747
Ja.

545
00:39:38,997 --> 00:39:40,708
Shall I take it away?

546
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:45,452
"In den... in den..."

547
00:39:45,548 --> 00:39:47,091
In den wolken.

548
00:39:47,342 --> 00:39:48,523
In den wolken!

549
00:39:48,524 --> 00:39:50,965
(Clementine) In den wol...?

550
00:39:52,299 --> 00:39:54,266
- Wolken.
- Wo...

551
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:56,103
- Champagne, sir?
- No, thank you.

552
00:39:56,105 --> 00:39:59,438
- What does it mean?
- (Uli) "Up in the clouds."

553
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,470
Oh! How beautiful.

554
00:40:08,971 --> 00:40:11,102
- Bye, girls.
- Bye.

555
00:40:11,104 --> 00:40:12,598
Take care.

556
00:40:15,404 --> 00:40:19,406
(Mario) Nice to meet you,
my friend. I hope I work
with you again.

557
00:40:19,408 --> 00:40:21,474
(Man) It was a pleasure, Mario.

558
00:40:23,114 --> 00:40:25,213
- We're going to miss you.
- Miss you already.

559
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:27,281
- Take care.
- Take care, you.

560
00:40:34,222 --> 00:40:36,123
(Launch departs)

561
00:40:45,804 --> 00:40:48,870
(♪ Dance music,
screaming and laughing)

562
00:40:57,846 --> 00:41:00,781
(♪ Modjo:
"Lady (hear me tonight)")

563
00:41:07,183 --> 00:41:09,116
Look at that.

564
00:41:11,352 --> 00:41:13,219
Sad, huh?

565
00:41:16,862 --> 00:41:18,829
He's hunting.

566
00:41:18,831 --> 00:41:21,095
- (Carl) Huh?
- He's hunting!

567
00:41:22,801 --> 00:41:24,261
Big dilemma.

568
00:41:25,363 --> 00:41:28,705
Should he take risk,
or go to the room, huh?

569
00:41:32,203 --> 00:41:33,631
Come on.

570
00:41:36,879 --> 00:41:38,636
Look, look!

571
00:41:38,638 --> 00:41:41,506
Maybe has a little chance!

572
00:41:41,508 --> 00:41:43,574
(Chuckling)

573
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:07,066
Amazing...

574
00:42:10,235 --> 00:42:11,740
Wow.

575
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,568
Sorry if I'm interrupting.

576
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:19,372
Er... could you
just do me a favor?

577
00:42:20,573 --> 00:42:23,178
I have this girl,
who should be here with me,

578
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:26,082
but couldn't come and...

579
00:42:26,084 --> 00:42:29,183
I would like to take
a picture. Please.

580
00:42:30,251 --> 00:42:33,186
- Can you take my picture?
- Oh, yeah, of course.

581
00:42:34,827 --> 00:42:36,716
I'll stand over here.

582
00:42:38,094 --> 00:42:39,895
Oh! Sorry, sorry!

583
00:42:49,906 --> 00:42:51,498
Good?

584
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,941
- Thank you very much.
- (Yaya) A pleasure...

585
00:42:54,943 --> 00:42:57,569
- Have a nice evening.
- (Yaya) Yeah, you, too.

586
00:43:02,542 --> 00:43:04,706
Excuse me? Mister?

587
00:43:05,577 --> 00:43:09,248
Hi! Eh...
Can you please come back?

588
00:43:11,858 --> 00:43:13,890
You can leave your
beer, it's okay.

589
00:43:13,892 --> 00:43:16,518
- What?
- You can leave your beer.

590
00:43:19,622 --> 00:43:21,864
- If you come in the middle...
- Yeah?

591
00:43:21,866 --> 00:43:23,898
Then we can take a picture
together, the three of us.

592
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,295
Okay, nice! Nice!

593
00:43:26,297 --> 00:43:28,066
Yeah!

594
00:43:28,068 --> 00:43:30,134
- Now we're talking!
- Yeah!

595
00:43:32,797 --> 00:43:35,633
(Woman) More boobs, yaya!
More boobs!

596
00:43:35,635 --> 00:43:37,404
- (Laughing)
- Oh...

597
00:43:38,605 --> 00:43:42,276
(Man) Thank you very much!
You're very generous!

598
00:43:43,476 --> 00:43:46,246
I would like to do something
generous to you.

599
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:48,313
They have rolex watches
in the reception.

600
00:43:48,315 --> 00:43:50,810
We can go down there now, and
I will buy you rolex watches!

601
00:43:50,812 --> 00:43:53,317
- No, it's okay. Thank you.
- No! I would like...

602
00:43:53,319 --> 00:43:55,649
It may sound strange, but i'm...

603
00:43:55,651 --> 00:43:59,488
What you just did here,
it meant so much to me.

604
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:01,622
So I can...

605
00:44:01,624 --> 00:44:03,458
I'm very rich.

606
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:07,000
Yes, let's not beat around
the bush. I'm very rich.

607
00:44:07,002 --> 00:44:08,902
- How rich are you?
- Oh, I'm so...

608
00:44:08,904 --> 00:44:12,828
I'm so fucking rich!
I just sold my company.

609
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:17,008
(Captain) Yeah, I'm not drunk! I
told you, I'm not feeling well.

610
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:20,835
- (Door opens)
- Do you have problem with that?

611
00:44:20,837 --> 00:44:23,177
Can't you respect that?

612
00:44:23,179 --> 00:44:25,015
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

613
00:44:25,017 --> 00:44:27,643
- Good evening, madam.
- Good evening.

614
00:44:28,178 --> 00:44:30,810
(Captain) Are you
still there, Paula?

615
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:37,816
- Thomas?
- What is it?

616
00:44:37,818 --> 00:44:43,194
I just want to ask you when
you're able to hold the
captain's dinner?

617
00:44:43,196 --> 00:44:45,998
Oh, for fuck's sake...

618
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,265
- I can't do the
captain's dinner now!

619
00:44:48,267 --> 00:44:50,035
- No, I'm asking you a question,
Thomas.

620
00:44:50,037 --> 00:44:53,873
When are you able to put
on your uniform and be
there for the guests?

621
00:44:54,575 --> 00:45:00,043
Oh... okay.
Well, what's the forecast?

622
00:45:00,045 --> 00:45:03,508
The weather's fine, Thomas.
It's about when you can do it.

623
00:45:04,346 --> 00:45:06,512
Any day but Thursday.

624
00:45:06,514 --> 00:45:09,714
- Thurs... Thursday's good.
- No. Thomas.

625
00:45:09,716 --> 00:45:11,485
- Thursday's bad.
- Huh?

626
00:45:11,487 --> 00:45:14,422
We have a low-pressure zone
moving in. Any day but Thursday.

627
00:45:14,424 --> 00:45:17,965
- Yes, Thursday! Okay!
- Okay, Thomas, listen.

628
00:45:17,967 --> 00:45:19,891
I'll come back and talk to you
about this later.

629
00:45:19,893 --> 00:45:23,333
Paula! Every day,
they eat dinner.

630
00:45:23,335 --> 00:45:28,175
And they're going to eat dinner
Thursday as well. Right?

631
00:45:28,177 --> 00:45:32,015
Your most expensive champagne,
and three glasses.

632
00:45:32,017 --> 00:45:34,117
- Is this your boyfriends?
- (Both) Yeah.

633
00:45:34,918 --> 00:45:38,287
Guys, you take care
of these girls now!

634
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:43,919
They're really, really nice
girls! Generous. Caring.

635
00:45:43,921 --> 00:45:46,164
You treat them right, you know!

636
00:45:47,101 --> 00:45:49,364
You think they want
some champagne?

637
00:45:49,367 --> 00:45:52,138
Okay, five glasses!
Five glasses.

638
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:02,050
Ludmilla...

639
00:46:02,052 --> 00:46:04,646
- (Ludmilla) I love you, baby!
- (Man) Yeah, yeah...

640
00:46:07,718 --> 00:46:10,225
(Ludmilla) Dance with me!

641
00:46:10,227 --> 00:46:13,723
- (Man) I'm terrible at dancing.
- (Yaya) What if I go?

642
00:46:14,594 --> 00:46:16,628
- Come on, dance with me!
- No, no...

643
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:18,729
Come on! Just a little bit.

644
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:22,966
- No, i'm... I'm so...
- Come on. Don't be shy!

645
00:46:22,968 --> 00:46:24,802
- No...
- Why? I'm dancing.

646
00:46:24,804 --> 00:46:28,477
- No... I never dance.
- Come on, dance with me.

647
00:46:28,479 --> 00:46:29,940
- I just don't.
- Why not?

648
00:46:29,942 --> 00:46:33,121
- I don't like it.
- Okay.

649
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:36,750
- I feel embarrassed.
- Alright, it's okay.
Whatever...

650
00:47:19,474 --> 00:47:20,803
Carl?

651
00:47:22,972 --> 00:47:25,643
Carl? Are you jealous?

652
00:47:25,645 --> 00:47:27,416
(Yaya giggles)

653
00:47:27,418 --> 00:47:30,452
Hey! Carl?

654
00:47:30,454 --> 00:47:32,356
(Knocking at door)

655
00:47:33,886 --> 00:47:36,690
- (Carl) Who's Carl?
- What?

656
00:47:40,564 --> 00:47:43,830
- You're not Carl?
- No, no. I'm the pool guy.

657
00:47:43,832 --> 00:47:45,535
(Yaya) Ooh...

658
00:47:46,407 --> 00:47:47,901
(Giggling)

659
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:54,546
Sorry about coming
into the mansion, I just
needed to get some tools.

660
00:47:54,548 --> 00:47:56,251
(Yaya) Oh?

661
00:48:00,588 --> 00:48:02,588
Over here...

662
00:48:05,561 --> 00:48:08,266
It's very inappropriate.

663
00:48:08,268 --> 00:48:10,059
(Carl clears throat)

664
00:48:11,371 --> 00:48:13,029
What if my, er...

665
00:48:14,638 --> 00:48:16,243
Husband comes home?

666
00:48:16,245 --> 00:48:17,936
Where is your husband?

667
00:48:17,938 --> 00:48:21,381
He really shouldn't
be leaving such a beautiful
girl on her own.

668
00:48:21,383 --> 00:48:24,219
Because it's very dangerous
around here.

669
00:48:24,221 --> 00:48:25,714
(Giggling)

670
00:48:27,785 --> 00:48:30,083
- He's working.
- Oh...

671
00:48:31,086 --> 00:48:33,329
- Always working...
- Is he?

672
00:48:33,331 --> 00:48:36,024
Yeah.
It's hot, huh?

673
00:48:36,026 --> 00:48:38,335
- Yeah, I'm very hot.
- You should take that off.

674
00:48:38,337 --> 00:48:41,272
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Ooh.

675
00:48:42,066 --> 00:48:43,539
Ooh!

676
00:48:47,808 --> 00:48:52,219
The thing is, your husband pays
me a lot of money, you see.

677
00:48:52,221 --> 00:48:57,489
So, I do have to just make sure
I'm doing my job properly.

678
00:48:57,491 --> 00:48:59,821
- Okay?
- You check the pipes.

679
00:48:59,823 --> 00:49:01,691
Yeah, is there any...

680
00:49:02,327 --> 00:49:05,091
Is there any down here
that need to be...

681
00:49:06,502 --> 00:49:10,636
Unblocked, or...
Is everything okay?

682
00:49:13,972 --> 00:49:16,071
You're sure you're the right guy
for the job?

683
00:49:16,073 --> 00:49:19,009
I am, I am. I'm very qualified.

684
00:49:19,011 --> 00:49:21,286
Hmm... let me see.

685
00:49:28,692 --> 00:49:30,595
(Camera shutter clicking)

686
00:49:52,293 --> 00:49:55,019
(Woman) Do you know what
people regret on their deathbed?

687
00:49:55,021 --> 00:49:56,690
Can you turn the phone?

688
00:49:56,692 --> 00:49:58,297
- (Steward) No.
- (Woman) No?

689
00:49:58,299 --> 00:50:01,564
That they were working too much,
seven out of ten people regret

690
00:50:01,566 --> 00:50:05,863
throwing away their lives
on stupid and pointless jobs.

691
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:08,602
- Can I get you
anything to drink?

692
00:50:08,742 --> 00:50:11,328
<i>More champagne, please.</i>

693
00:50:11,409 --> 00:50:16,037
I don't know, I was
just born into this life.
It was not my fault.

694
00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:20,744
And when this happened, I...
I just felt like, "why? Why?"

695
00:50:20,746 --> 00:50:24,208
- Life is so unfair.
- Yeah.

696
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:26,781
We are all equal.

697
00:50:26,783 --> 00:50:29,718
- That is so true.
- Everyone's equal.

698
00:50:38,431 --> 00:50:41,893
Is there anything you wish for?

699
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:47,700
- Sorry?
- Is there anything
you... wish for?

700
00:50:48,901 --> 00:50:52,066
Well... well, I don't know.

701
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:56,938
That's so sweet of you, madam,
but I'm perfectly fine.

702
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:02,074
But, but, but, but if today
was your last day alive...

703
00:51:03,385 --> 00:51:07,354
- Hmm... what would
you wish for?
- I have no idea.

704
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:12,786
- Have you been
for a swim today?
- No, not today.

705
00:51:13,623 --> 00:51:17,021
Why don't you go for a swim
right now?

706
00:51:19,288 --> 00:51:22,333
Because this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

707
00:51:22,335 --> 00:51:25,929
That's so kind of you,
madam, but unfortunately
we're not allowed

708
00:51:25,931 --> 00:51:28,832
to go for a swim
during working hours, so...

709
00:51:28,834 --> 00:51:31,472
I want all the staff
to go for a swim!

710
00:51:31,474 --> 00:51:34,607
I want you all to go for a swim!

711
00:51:34,609 --> 00:51:39,874
I really feel that I've had
one of these moments.

712
00:51:39,876 --> 00:51:43,977
Yeah, well, today might be
a little bit problematic...

713
00:51:43,979 --> 00:51:45,275
Problematic?

714
00:51:45,277 --> 00:51:47,210
Cos today we have
the captain's dinner.

715
00:51:47,212 --> 00:51:51,488
Who cares about the
captain's dinner? This will
only take half an hour.

716
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:53,490
Come on, now.

717
00:51:53,492 --> 00:51:55,854
You work too hard, come on.

718
00:51:57,253 --> 00:52:00,759
<i>- Yeah, well, let me
see what I can do.
- Merci!</i>

719
00:52:10,935 --> 00:52:14,265
No, no, no! Come back!
Come back, please.

720
00:52:14,267 --> 00:52:17,872
Please come back.
I have a better idea.

721
00:52:18,678 --> 00:52:20,775
- Sit down.
- Okay.

722
00:52:22,273 --> 00:52:25,175
Let's reverse roles.

723
00:52:25,177 --> 00:52:28,452
- Sorry?
- Just change roles.

724
00:52:30,182 --> 00:52:34,623
You... chillax in the jacuzzi,
and I'll get the captain.

725
00:52:34,625 --> 00:52:36,151
Oh... well...

726
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:40,121
Come on! Just be in the moment,
like I was. Please!

727
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:42,629
- Yeah, but...
- Come, come, I know
you want to.

728
00:52:42,631 --> 00:52:44,861
- Come on!
- Yes, I do but...

729
00:52:44,863 --> 00:52:47,127
But there might be
a problem for me, if I...

730
00:52:47,129 --> 00:52:50,063
Now I have to be the authority.

731
00:52:50,065 --> 00:52:52,867
- Yeah, well, I have
my clothes on...
- Shut up, shut up, shut up!

732
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:54,507
Shut up! Now!

733
00:52:56,610 --> 00:53:00,270
I command you, enjoy the moment!

734
00:53:03,373 --> 00:53:05,812
- N-Now?
- Please.

735
00:53:10,456 --> 00:53:12,114
- No.
- No?

736
00:53:12,116 --> 00:53:14,149
- No.
- What?

737
00:53:15,086 --> 00:53:17,052
- You say "no" to me?
- No. No!

738
00:53:17,054 --> 00:53:18,724
- So it's "yes"?
- Yes... no.

739
00:53:18,726 --> 00:53:21,220
- "Yes" or "no"?
- I'm saying...

740
00:53:22,388 --> 00:53:24,356
Sorry, I'm saying, n...

741
00:53:25,061 --> 00:53:26,500
I'm saying...

742
00:53:27,437 --> 00:53:31,064
- Yes.
- Yes! Ha-ha!

743
00:53:31,066 --> 00:53:34,231
Don't worry.
Dimitrios will buy the yacht.

744
00:53:34,233 --> 00:53:36,398
Come on! Sit down, sit down.

745
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,577
- Okay, I'm going in.
- Quick, quick, quick... yes!

746
00:53:40,751 --> 00:53:45,170
(She speaks French) Come on over!
A glass of champagne for...

747
00:53:45,308 --> 00:53:47,176
- This wonderful miss...
- Alicia.

748
00:53:47,255 --> 00:53:50,007
Alicia!
Mademoiselle Alicia!

749
00:53:50,257 --> 00:53:52,677
A glass of champagne!

750
00:53:58,253 --> 00:54:00,956
(Paula) Darius? I
need your help.

751
00:54:00,958 --> 00:54:05,091
I need you tell one of
the guests that the crew
can't go for a swim.

752
00:54:05,093 --> 00:54:06,632
Why?

753
00:54:06,634 --> 00:54:08,699
Well, I told them it's not
possible because of the dinner,

754
00:54:08,701 --> 00:54:11,669
but they want to hear it
from the captain in person.

755
00:54:11,671 --> 00:54:14,396
So I went to Thomas' cabin,
I knocked on it, he's not there.

756
00:54:14,398 --> 00:54:17,200
He's not responding.
I can't get a hold of him, so...

757
00:54:17,202 --> 00:54:19,401
Could you just please go and
tell them it's not possible?

758
00:54:19,403 --> 00:54:22,678
- That would be a big help.
- Can't you just go for a swim?

759
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,943
No. I mean,
that would be the easiest,

760
00:54:24,945 --> 00:54:27,912
but they want us to go
from the water slide and...

761
00:54:27,914 --> 00:54:31,080
It's not even funny.
Why are you laughing, Erik?

762
00:54:31,082 --> 00:54:33,522
- Why are you even here?
- I'm on my break.

763
00:54:33,524 --> 00:54:36,249
Well, your break is over.
Go back to work.

764
00:54:36,251 --> 00:54:39,889
It's not even installed yet,
it will take forever, and
I don't have that time.

765
00:54:39,891 --> 00:54:42,957
The chef has started the dinner,
I need the prep-time.

766
00:54:42,959 --> 00:54:44,794
So please go and tell them
it's not possible...

767
00:54:44,796 --> 00:54:47,225
I'm not going to go and talk
to some crazy Russians.

768
00:54:47,227 --> 00:54:49,766
It's not crazy Russians,
it's very rich Russians.

769
00:54:49,768 --> 00:54:50,964
Same thing.

770
00:54:50,966 --> 00:54:53,131
Go and solve this problem first,
and then...

771
00:54:53,133 --> 00:54:55,606
No! We're done.

772
00:54:55,608 --> 00:54:59,642
- Why won't you do this?
- Go and take a swim. Jesus...

773
00:54:59,644 --> 00:55:01,467
- Hello, sir!
- Hello.

774
00:55:01,469 --> 00:55:05,207
- Can I help you?
- I was just looking.

775
00:55:05,209 --> 00:55:07,440
- You want to see the bridge?
- If possible.

776
00:55:07,442 --> 00:55:11,444
Of course. I can get the
first officer. He's not doing
anything right now.

777
00:55:12,313 --> 00:55:14,821
- Could you show the
guest the bridge?
- Yes, of course.

778
00:55:14,823 --> 00:55:16,658
Welcome to the bridge.

779
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:19,957
I'm Darius. Nice to meet you.

780
00:55:32,499 --> 00:55:34,036
Thomas?

781
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,371
Thomas? Hello?

782
00:55:46,412 --> 00:55:48,919
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

783
00:55:48,921 --> 00:55:54,153
- Actually... I have a question.
- Yes, of course.

784
00:55:54,155 --> 00:55:57,355
Yesterday, I was
up on the sundeck.

785
00:55:57,357 --> 00:56:00,489
And the sun was shining,
everything was perfect.

786
00:56:00,491 --> 00:56:02,866
But then I looked at the sails.

787
00:56:02,868 --> 00:56:04,835
- The sails?
- Yes.

788
00:56:04,837 --> 00:56:07,497
And they were... a bit dirty.

789
00:56:07,499 --> 00:56:09,873
- Oh!
- Yeah.

790
00:56:09,875 --> 00:56:11,709
- Oh...
- Yeah.

791
00:56:11,711 --> 00:56:14,679
(♪ Russian choral music playing)

792
00:56:18,916 --> 00:56:20,476
Hello?

793
00:56:21,688 --> 00:56:22,753
Hi.

794
00:56:26,517 --> 00:56:30,595
Yeah, but do you
realize the food down
here is going to be bad?

795
00:56:32,158 --> 00:56:33,565
Okay, bye.

796
00:56:34,301 --> 00:56:37,359
Okay, guys, listen up.
You are going to swim.

797
00:56:37,361 --> 00:56:40,131
So, bring your swimming pants,
and go to the main deck

798
00:56:40,133 --> 00:56:42,562
as quick as possible, okay?

799
00:56:42,564 --> 00:56:46,742
Come on! Chop, chop!
You're going to water slide.

800
00:56:46,744 --> 00:56:48,436
Have fun!

801
00:56:51,242 --> 00:56:53,143
(Speaks native language)
Friends! Friends!

802
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,173
Please come out!
Friends!

803
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:58,551
Hey, what are you still doing here?

804
00:56:58,677 --> 00:57:00,838
Put on your swimsuits right away.
We're going swimming.

805
00:57:00,886 --> 00:57:03,012
- When?
- Now! Now!

806
00:57:04,055 --> 00:57:05,057
Outside!

807
00:57:05,683 --> 00:57:09,352
Put on your swimming trunks.
We are going to the "beach".

808
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:10,812
- What?
- We're going swimming.

809
00:57:10,895 --> 00:57:12,815
Go, go!
Okay, we'll put on our trunks.

810
00:57:12,898 --> 00:57:13,899
Okay, friend.

811
00:57:30,575 --> 00:57:32,016
Thomas?

812
00:57:34,282 --> 00:57:35,788
(Bottles cascade)

813
00:57:38,727 --> 00:57:40,154
Thomas?

814
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,959
(Tannoy bells chime)

815
00:57:44,094 --> 00:57:45,797
(Paula) 'Good afternoon.

816
00:57:45,799 --> 00:57:48,558
'I hope that everyone
has had a great day so far,

817
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:52,363
'and that you're looking forward
to the captain's dinner tonight.

818
00:57:52,365 --> 00:57:56,742
'We would like to inform
you that we have a slight
change in the schedule.

819
00:57:56,744 --> 00:57:59,876
'The captain's dinner
will be held at 8:30,

820
00:57:59,878 --> 00:58:03,143
'and not at 8:00,
as it says on the daily program.

821
00:58:03,145 --> 00:58:07,212
'I repeat: The captain's dinner
will be held at 8:30.

822
00:58:07,214 --> 00:58:08,477
'Thank you.'

823
00:58:08,479 --> 00:58:10,480
why the push?

824
00:58:10,482 --> 00:58:13,218
(Darius) Cos the crew's going
for a... a swim.

825
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,959
- (Laughs)
- It's a request from
one of the Russians.

826
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:22,326
- From the water slide.
- Oh, my god! This I gotta see.

827
00:58:22,328 --> 00:58:24,768
Whoa, whoa!
Do you want to change first?

828
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:28,497
- Oh, Alessandra! How are you?
- Alicia.

829
00:58:28,499 --> 00:58:31,202
- Al...?
- Can you leave us
for a bit, please?

830
00:58:31,204 --> 00:58:33,006
Let's go inside, yeah?

831
00:58:33,008 --> 00:58:35,009
I think you need to change
if you wanna go up...

832
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:36,779
Yeah, yeah...

833
00:58:36,781 --> 00:58:38,781
- Let's go inside and talk.
- No, no...

834
00:58:39,607 --> 00:58:41,575
Are you okay, man?

835
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:44,610
- Good.
- Yeah?

836
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:48,790
- Very good.
- We have four and
a half hours left.

837
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:50,682
Until the captain's dinner.

838
00:58:50,684 --> 00:58:54,191
You chill in your room,
have little nap. I'll be
back in a couple of hours.

839
00:58:54,193 --> 00:58:56,456
And we'll... go together.

840
00:58:56,458 --> 00:58:58,524
- Yeah?
- (Chuckling)

841
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:03,804
Darius...

842
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:05,497
Look at you!

843
00:59:05,499 --> 00:59:10,568
What are you all worked
up about? I'm fine!
Just totally fine.

844
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:14,143
- Yeah?
- Completely, a
hundred percent...

845
00:59:15,344 --> 00:59:17,377
Fine.

846
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:21,678
- Mohammed! Mohammed!
- What?

847
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,647
Come! Let's go! Come, come!

848
00:59:23,649 --> 00:59:26,760
- What?
- Let's go!

849
00:59:28,323 --> 00:59:30,422
(Woman) Oh! Whoo!

850
00:59:32,063 --> 00:59:33,656
Wonderful!

851
00:59:35,297 --> 00:59:36,769
(Whooping)

852
00:59:37,403 --> 00:59:39,739
- (Alicia) Some champagne.
- (Woman) Bravo!

853
00:59:43,403 --> 00:59:45,303
(Woman speaks French)
Santé!

854
00:59:48,672 --> 00:59:51,930
Are we enjoying ourselves? Yes!

855
00:59:51,932 --> 00:59:53,564
(Deep rumble)

856
01:00:01,641 --> 01:00:03,607
(Rumbling and banging)

857
01:00:16,247 --> 01:00:18,378
(Banging and creaking)

858
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,610
(Whooping and laughing)

859
01:00:30,888 --> 01:00:33,988
If you just stand here,
and they will be coming to you.

860
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:37,519
- Okay.
- Let me see you. Okay.

861
01:00:39,425 --> 01:00:41,688
- Okay!
- Thank you, Paula.

862
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:44,131
- Just one night, that's all.
- Okay.

863
01:00:45,234 --> 01:00:48,939
Darius, could you stand next
to him? Just to make sure...

864
01:00:54,374 --> 01:00:56,837
- Okay? You're ready?
- Thank you.

865
01:00:56,839 --> 01:00:58,377
- Yep.
- Yes.

866
01:00:59,677 --> 01:01:02,315
(Paula) Okay, let's get ready
to open the doors.

867
01:01:02,317 --> 01:01:04,813
Open on my signal, yes?

868
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,092
And... go.

869
01:01:12,691 --> 01:01:14,198
Good evening.

870
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,396
- Welcome to the
captain's dinner.
- Thank you.

871
01:01:16,398 --> 01:01:19,433
- Would you like a
glass of champagne?
- Thank you very much.

872
01:01:19,435 --> 01:01:22,370
Good evening.
Welcome to the captain's dinner.

873
01:01:22,372 --> 01:01:24,010
Hi... hi!

874
01:01:24,012 --> 01:01:26,836
Good evening.
Enjoying your cruise?

875
01:01:28,181 --> 01:01:30,379
- (Darius) Welcome.
- (Thomas) Hello, ma'am.

876
01:01:30,381 --> 01:01:32,986
Nice to meet you.
Enjoy your dinner.

877
01:01:34,716 --> 01:01:37,387
Oh, hello, ma'am. How are you?

878
01:01:37,389 --> 01:01:39,388
(Darius) Enjoy your dinner.

879
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:41,853
Hope the weather's not
too rough on you.

880
01:01:43,198 --> 01:01:45,066
- (Thomas) Hello, sir.
- Hi.

881
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:46,595
- (Thomas) Welcome.
- Thank you.

882
01:01:46,597 --> 01:01:48,762
(Darius) Nice to meet you.
Enjoy your dinner.

883
01:01:48,764 --> 01:01:51,369
- (Thomas) Hello, sir.
- Good evening.
Jarmo björkman...

884
01:01:51,371 --> 01:01:53,767
I have a question. I'm sorry.

885
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:58,343
- Yesterday, I was up on deck.
- Yes.

886
01:01:58,345 --> 01:02:02,018
And it was so beautiful.
Everything was fantastic.

887
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:04,219
But then, I saw the sails.

888
01:02:04,847 --> 01:02:06,782
(Thomas) The sails?

889
01:02:06,784 --> 01:02:08,486
- The sails, yes.
- Oh...

890
01:02:08,488 --> 01:02:11,997
Yeah. And they were dirt-gray.

891
01:02:13,428 --> 01:02:15,726
Do you think it's possible
to wash them?

892
01:02:15,728 --> 01:02:19,829
Well, I don't think that's
possible, ma'am, because, er...

893
01:02:19,831 --> 01:02:23,206
- This is a motorized vessel.
- Yeah.

894
01:02:23,208 --> 01:02:25,604
So, we don't have any sails.

895
01:02:25,606 --> 01:02:28,475
(Crockery and
glassware clanging)

896
01:02:28,477 --> 01:02:31,216
Maybe it was the sundeck roof?

897
01:02:31,218 --> 01:02:36,055
- Well... are you sure?
- I'm sure.

898
01:02:38,918 --> 01:02:41,424
<i>(Speaks Swedish)
- Magnus!
- Yes?</i>

899
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:48,891
The ship in the catalogue
had bright white sails, didn't it?

900
01:02:49,058 --> 01:02:50,936
- Yes.
- Right.

901
01:02:51,932 --> 01:02:54,274
Yes. He says yes.

902
01:02:54,276 --> 01:02:56,439
- It was sails.
- (Thomas) Magnus says yes.

903
01:02:56,441 --> 01:02:57,672
Yes.

904
01:02:58,642 --> 01:03:00,973
Jesus Christ...

905
01:03:00,975 --> 01:03:03,613
Well, then, in that case,

906
01:03:03,615 --> 01:03:05,945
we will clean the sails.

907
01:03:05,947 --> 01:03:09,091
- Yes.
- (Woman) Of course.

908
01:03:09,093 --> 01:03:12,656
I'm sure we can find
a solution for you. I'm sure...

909
01:03:12,658 --> 01:03:14,955
- Can I escort you to a table?
- Okay.

910
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:17,100
- (Darius) Enjoy your dinner.
- Thank you.

911
01:03:17,102 --> 01:03:20,466
Well... jarmo björkman.
I'm sitting at your table.

912
01:03:20,468 --> 01:03:22,667
- Oh! Good, good.
- Hello, jarmo.

913
01:03:22,669 --> 01:03:24,470
Are you also sitting
at the captain's table?

914
01:03:24,472 --> 01:03:25,604
Yes, I am.

915
01:03:25,606 --> 01:03:28,178
- Is it this one?
- Yes. Go ahead.

916
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:29,938
Oh, lord...

917
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:32,150
(Glassware clattering)

918
01:03:32,152 --> 01:03:33,942
(Deep thud)

919
01:03:33,944 --> 01:03:36,352
(Baby starts bawling)

920
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:44,790
It's not so much apps as code.

921
01:03:44,792 --> 01:03:49,025
I create code for apps.
So you can program...

922
01:03:49,027 --> 01:03:54,801
So, I sell my codes and
my skills to different
tech companies.

923
01:03:56,244 --> 01:04:01,841
And then, the game makers
are pitching ideas to me.

924
01:04:01,843 --> 01:04:03,711
(Waitress) Sir.

925
01:04:07,982 --> 01:04:09,421
So, good evening.

926
01:04:09,423 --> 01:04:11,720
For tonight's first meal,
we will be serving you

927
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:14,888
some delicious oysters
with some black Russian caviar.

928
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:17,793
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

929
01:04:24,341 --> 01:04:27,408
- (Waitress) Are we
enjoying the food?
- (Woman) Yes, very much.

930
01:04:35,781 --> 01:04:38,354
So, what business
do you have together?

931
01:04:38,356 --> 01:04:40,586
(Winston) Oh, it's
a family business.

932
01:04:40,588 --> 01:04:43,854
Producing products
in precision engineering.

933
01:04:45,198 --> 01:04:47,022
(Carl) What do you manufacture?

934
01:04:47,024 --> 01:04:50,202
Well, our products have been
employed in upholding democracy

935
01:04:50,204 --> 01:04:52,469
all over the world.

936
01:04:58,069 --> 01:04:59,937
What product is that?

937
01:04:59,939 --> 01:05:03,578
Basically, our best-selling
product is the hand grenade.

938
01:05:05,286 --> 01:05:07,253
(Yaya) Sorry, the what?

939
01:05:07,255 --> 01:05:09,552
The hand grenade, dear.

940
01:05:10,555 --> 01:05:12,752
(Man coughs and retches)

941
01:05:15,362 --> 01:05:18,232
For a long time, it was
the personal exploding device.

942
01:05:18,234 --> 01:05:22,895
But then came those
UN regulations, and
messed everything up.

943
01:05:22,897 --> 01:05:26,240
A personal exploding device...

944
01:05:26,242 --> 01:05:27,834
Excuse me.

945
01:05:27,836 --> 01:05:32,212
Is a very complicated word
for a land mine.

946
01:05:32,214 --> 01:05:34,676
(Winston chuckles) Yeah...

947
01:05:35,910 --> 01:05:40,145
Those regulations trimmed...
25% off on profits.

948
01:05:40,147 --> 01:05:42,982
- Yeah.
- It was hard times
for us, but...

949
01:05:43,783 --> 01:05:47,624
- We pulled together, didn't we?
- Yes, we did, darling.

950
01:05:47,626 --> 01:05:50,298
And we still love each other.

951
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:52,201
- A toast!
- (Winston) Oh, yeah.

952
01:05:52,995 --> 01:05:56,095
Er... to love!

953
01:05:57,406 --> 01:05:58,767
- To love.
- To love.

954
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:03,279
(Banging and rattling)

955
01:06:04,513 --> 01:06:05,973
(Baby crying)

956
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:10,583
- (Waitress) Sir.
- Madam.

957
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:19,020
This is our sea urchin,
with an emulsion of sea weed.

958
01:06:19,022 --> 01:06:23,024
On top, you've got black
truffle, caviar, chili oil,

959
01:06:23,026 --> 01:06:25,763
and a drizzle of
yuzu vinaigrette.

960
01:06:25,765 --> 01:06:27,633
- Enjoy!
- Thank you.

961
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:33,738
- (Woman) Hmm!
- Hmm...

962
01:06:40,879 --> 01:06:44,078
- (Waitress) Are you
enjoying yourself?
- (Man) Yes.

963
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:46,048
(Waitress) Madam.

964
01:06:46,050 --> 01:06:47,588
(Glassware rattling)

965
01:06:50,527 --> 01:06:52,890
- (Crockery falling)
- (Woman screams)

966
01:07:06,708 --> 01:07:08,280
(Waitress) Sir.

967
01:07:09,206 --> 01:07:11,040
Madam.

968
01:07:12,352 --> 01:07:15,320
- So are you feeling
a bit seasick?
- Yes, a bit.

969
01:07:15,323 --> 01:07:17,587
Yes, so I think it would be
better to eat something,

970
01:07:17,589 --> 01:07:20,392
because seasickness is worse
on an empty stomach.

971
01:07:43,076 --> 01:07:44,482
Sir.

972
01:07:52,284 --> 01:07:56,286
So, now we are serving
some hamburger with French
fries for the captain.

973
01:07:56,288 --> 01:07:58,222
And for you, we have
something really special.

974
01:07:58,224 --> 01:08:02,568
We have grilled and
smoked octopus along with
some caramelized lemon,

975
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:05,999
and on top, beautiful garden
flowers. Please enjoy.

976
01:08:07,266 --> 01:08:09,674
I'm not a fan of fine dining.

977
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,580
- Are you okay?
- (Grunts)

978
01:08:21,149 --> 01:08:24,150
Madam? Dagueneau,
French, sauvignon blanc?

979
01:08:24,374 --> 01:08:25,207
Champignon...

980
01:08:25,373 --> 01:08:26,666
Du champagne! S'il vous plaît.

981
01:08:26,791 --> 01:08:28,221
Champagne.

982
01:08:30,499 --> 01:08:32,500
(Belches)

983
01:08:32,502 --> 01:08:34,028
Quick!

984
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:41,102
<i>Santé!
(belches)</i>

985
01:08:41,937 --> 01:08:45,678
If you feel seasick, you should
try and eat something, ma'am.

986
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:48,846
- Oh, are you okay?
- (Sudden violent gust)

987
01:08:48,848 --> 01:08:52,850
- (Man retches)
- (Waitress) Are you
alright, sir?

988
01:08:53,852 --> 01:08:56,084
- (Man groans)
- Sir?

989
01:09:02,291 --> 01:09:04,158
(Coughing)

990
01:09:07,604 --> 01:09:09,670
I'm good... (Retches)

991
01:09:12,543 --> 01:09:14,544
(Belches) Excuse me.

992
01:09:14,546 --> 01:09:16,841
- Are you okay?
- I'm afraid not...

993
01:09:18,879 --> 01:09:21,011
(Woman in Swedish) How are you?

994
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:26,050
(Ludmilla) Oh, my god! Oh!

995
01:09:26,052 --> 01:09:27,557
Please.

996
01:09:27,559 --> 01:09:29,889
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

997
01:09:29,891 --> 01:09:33,189
- Oh, my darling.
- (Mutters) More champagne...

998
01:09:34,225 --> 01:09:36,224
Maybe you should
have some water?

999
01:09:36,226 --> 01:09:37,667
Champagne.

1000
01:09:37,669 --> 01:09:40,229
Champagne? You should not
drink champagne now.

1001
01:09:40,231 --> 01:09:42,132
Take some water, please.

1002
01:09:44,742 --> 01:09:47,808
Okay. It's helping.
She's fine. Yeah...

1003
01:09:49,911 --> 01:09:51,681
(Screaming)

1004
01:09:51,684 --> 01:09:55,752
(Waitress) Okay, the restroom.
Let's go, I've got you.

1005
01:09:55,754 --> 01:09:58,754
- More wine, sir?
- (Woman) Ludmilla,
don't leave me!

1006
01:09:58,756 --> 01:10:01,218
(Weeping and retching continues)

1007
01:10:05,026 --> 01:10:07,254
(Squeegee squeaking)

1008
01:10:10,989 --> 01:10:12,856
You okay?

1009
01:10:12,858 --> 01:10:16,321
(Coughing and retching,
baby starts crying)

1010
01:10:20,602 --> 01:10:22,095
Darius?

1011
01:10:22,698 --> 01:10:27,430
- He doesn't look well.
- (Darius) You okay?
Feeling seasick, sir?

1012
01:10:27,432 --> 01:10:30,334
Is it your chest?
Here, chest pains.

1013
01:10:30,336 --> 01:10:32,709
- Grilled octopus...
- Ginger candy?

1014
01:10:33,942 --> 01:10:36,713
Oh, ma'am.
Thank you for tonight.

1015
01:10:38,277 --> 01:10:42,817
Everybody, let's try to
keep calm. Take your seats.

1016
01:10:42,819 --> 01:10:46,050
Er... the next course is going
to be wonderful.

1017
01:10:46,052 --> 01:10:48,790
Ginger candy?
It's good if you're seasick.

1018
01:10:48,792 --> 01:10:50,956
Ginger candy?
It's good if you're seasick.

1019
01:10:51,758 --> 01:10:53,827
Stay calm, everybody,
everything is fine.

1020
01:10:55,698 --> 01:10:57,291
(Jarmo shouts in Swedish)
Damn!

1021
01:10:57,925 --> 01:11:01,932
Excuse us. Excuse me.
Make way, please.

1022
01:11:01,934 --> 01:11:03,934
Are you okay?

1023
01:11:03,936 --> 01:11:06,365
Keep moving, everything is fine.
Everything is fine.

1024
01:11:06,367 --> 01:11:07,937
I'm gonna open your shirt.

1025
01:11:07,939 --> 01:11:09,741
- Is it a stroke?
- I don't know.

1026
01:11:09,743 --> 01:11:11,171
Everybody, stay calm!

1027
01:11:11,192 --> 01:11:12,402
In den wolken.

1028
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:15,977
Erik! Erik!
The defibrillator right now!

1029
01:11:16,113 --> 01:11:17,447
In den wolken!

1030
01:11:18,915 --> 01:11:22,280
- (Speaks German)
Careful! Careful!
- Thank you for tonight.

1031
01:11:22,282 --> 01:11:24,656
Thank you for tonight.
Thank you.

1032
01:11:24,658 --> 01:11:28,120
- Just clean up now.
- Take some deep
breaths for me, sir.

1033
01:11:28,249 --> 01:11:32,253
<i>Start by removing all clothing
from the patient's chest...</i>

1034
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:35,258
(Weeping and groaning continue)

1035
01:11:39,869 --> 01:11:42,573
(Groaning and retching)

1036
01:11:44,037 --> 01:11:46,004
Oh, oh!

1037
01:11:46,006 --> 01:11:50,502
- That's okay, madam.
- Hey... there, there.

1038
01:11:50,504 --> 01:11:53,142
I'm glad the hat came in useful.

1039
01:11:53,144 --> 01:11:56,585
- So sorry, darling...
- No, no. It's nothing at all.

1040
01:12:03,989 --> 01:12:06,792
(Russian man) Ha!
Okay, here we are.

1041
01:12:08,025 --> 01:12:09,486
Thank you.

1042
01:12:11,489 --> 01:12:15,932
I have a joke. Do you know
how to tell a communist?

1043
01:12:17,363 --> 01:12:20,198
It's someone
who reads Marx and Lenin.

1044
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:24,168
And do you know how to tell
an anti-communist?

1045
01:12:24,170 --> 01:12:25,709
Uh-huh.

1046
01:12:25,711 --> 01:12:30,504
It's someone who understands
Marx and Lenin. Ha-ha!

1047
01:12:30,506 --> 01:12:33,540
It's Ronald Reagan.
Funny guy!

1048
01:12:33,542 --> 01:12:38,214
"Never argue with an idiot,
they'll only bring you
down to their level

1049
01:12:38,216 --> 01:12:41,283
"and beat you with experience."
Mark twain.

1050
01:12:41,285 --> 01:12:43,724
Oh-oh... okay.

1051
01:12:43,726 --> 01:12:46,286
Ronald Reagan, he said also,

1052
01:12:46,288 --> 01:12:51,126
"socialism works only in heaven
where they don't need it,

1053
01:12:51,128 --> 01:12:55,195
"and in hell
where they already have it."

1054
01:12:55,197 --> 01:12:58,463
- (Thomas) That's...
That's pretty good.
- Yeah?

1055
01:12:58,465 --> 01:13:00,839
Okay. Hold on...
I've got one here.

1056
01:13:01,776 --> 01:13:03,533
Oh, oh, oh, no, I have one!

1057
01:13:03,535 --> 01:13:08,681
"Growth for the sake of
growth is the ideology
of a cancer cell."

1058
01:13:08,683 --> 01:13:10,782
- Ah...
- That's Edward Abbey.

1059
01:13:10,784 --> 01:13:15,510
Listen: "The problem with
socialism is that you eventually

1060
01:13:15,512 --> 01:13:18,579
"run out of other
people's money."

1061
01:13:18,581 --> 01:13:21,824
- Margaret Thatcher.
- You're going to
like this one...

1062
01:13:21,826 --> 01:13:26,894
"The last capitalist we
hang will be the one
who sold us the rope."

1063
01:13:26,896 --> 01:13:30,458
- Karl Marx.
- Oh! Shit!

1064
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,230
Okay! Okay, okay, okay...

1065
01:13:35,167 --> 01:13:37,298
(Crockery and glassware falling)

1066
01:13:38,532 --> 01:13:42,204
- Sorry.
- Dear god!

1067
01:13:42,206 --> 01:13:43,678
(Chuckling)

1068
01:13:45,241 --> 01:13:47,571
Okay. A classic.

1069
01:13:47,573 --> 01:13:51,113
"The most powerful single force
in the world today

1070
01:13:51,115 --> 01:13:55,953
"is man's eternal desire
to be free and independent."

1071
01:13:55,955 --> 01:13:58,251
- Kennedy.
- Okay.

1072
01:13:58,253 --> 01:14:01,760
"Freedom in capitalist society

1073
01:14:01,762 --> 01:14:03,729

"Freedom... for slave owners."

1075

I know. Vladimir Lenin!

1076
01:14:10,967 --> 01:14:12,462
- School.
- Ah...

1077
01:14:15,741 --> 01:14:19,467
A Russian capitalist,
and an American communist.

1078
01:14:19,469 --> 01:14:23,174
On a $250-million luxury yacht.

1079

Drink, my friend!

1083
01:14:49,330 --> 01:14:52,166
Drink, you're
supposed to drain it.

1084
01:14:52,168 --> 01:14:54,266
- Come on.
- Okay.

1085
01:14:54,268 --> 01:14:55,675
Drink!

1086

Stay focused.
- Okay. Okay, okay.

- Drink!
- Okay.

- Black.

1089

Very good.

1090

- Red or black?
- Er... black.

1091
01:15:13,221 --> 01:15:14,958
Have a drink.

1092

01:20:55,211 --> 01:20:58,938
- Open the door, Thomas.
- I'm so sorry, that
was irresponsible.

1176
01:20:58,940 --> 01:21:01,842
- Let us talk.
- Where's he going?

1177
01:21:02,977 --> 01:21:06,880

Let us talk. Open the door.

1179
01:21:14,594 --> 01:21:17,365
(Speaking in native language)
Thank you.

1180
01:21:18,158 --> 01:21:20,410
Something got broken here.

1181
01:21:20,661 --> 01:21:22,579
Ok, you take care of this.

1182
01:21:22,829 --> 01:21:25,958
Could you please put this there?
Thank you.

(Dimitry) 'We had a discussion,
and it's very important.'

1187
01:22:43,791 --> 01:22:48,091
and it was stupid.
But it was a technical problem.

1188
01:22:48,093 --> 01:22:52,667
- I have scared passengers...
- We didn't know.

1189
01:22:52,669 --> 01:22:57,133
Now you go in your cabin.
Relax, and we have discuss...

1190
01:22:57,135 --> 01:23:00,071
- Stop talking!
- Relax, Paula, it was okay.

1191
01:23:00,073 --> 01:23:04,350
Well, thank you for all your
work. I really appreciate it.

1192
01:23:04,352 --> 01:23:07,914
- Thomas! Thomas! Thomas?
- You are great.
You are not fired.

1193

- Come over here.
Bring the light.
- Okay.

1213
01:24:41,788 --> 01:24:44,723

old walking into the kitchen

1214
01:24:44,725 --> 01:24:47,793
to find my mother
crying inconsolably.

1215
01:24:47,795 --> 01:24:50,730
Martin Luther King
had been shot.

1216
01:24:50,732 --> 01:24:55,131
Two months later, she was crying
again. Bobby Kennedy was killed.

1217
01:24:55,133 --> 01:24:58,613
I couldn't know then what I know
now, that the invisible thread

1218

connecting Martin Luther King,
the Kennedy brothers,
and Malcolm X,

1219
01:25:02,749 --> 01:25:07,267
was that in each case,
my government had their
finger on the trigger.

- But every...

about you being black.

1292

see it in his eyes...

just calm down now.

It's not a good time
to step up the situation.

1298

stay positive.

the engine room?

you have to say.

1339
01:34:17,917 --> 01:34:20,149
- Is it closed?
- It's closed. It's closed.

1340
01:34:20,151 --> 01:34:23,514
- (Dimitry) Paula,
we need water!
- Be patient.

1341
01:34:23,516 --> 01:34:27,156
- Is somebody in there?
- Yeah, there's
someone in there.

1342
01:34:27,158 --> 01:34:29,323
- (Banging)
- (Paula) Calm down, calm down.

1343
01:34:29,325 --> 01:34:31,423
- (Jarmo) Does she have water?
- (Man) Yes.

1344
01:34:31,425 --> 01:34:35,725
- (Banging)
- (Dimitry) Open up! Open up!

1345
01:34:35,727 --> 01:34:40,137
(All chanting) Open up!
Open up! Open up!

1346
01:34:41,206 --> 01:34:44,943
- (Paula) It's Abigail.
Abigail! Come out!
- Ma'am Paula?

1347
01:34:44,945 --> 01:34:47,276
- (Paula) Are you okay?
- What?

1348
01:34:47,278 --> 01:34:49,179
- (Paula) Open the hatch!
- (All shouting) Water! Water!

1349
01:34:49,181 --> 01:34:51,577
- Okay!
- (Dimitry) Paula,
we need water...

1350
01:34:53,989 --> 01:34:57,022
- Hey, ma'am Paula!
- What do you have?

1351
01:34:57,491 --> 01:35:00,388
We need all of these boxes out.
Okay?

1352
01:35:00,390 --> 01:35:03,358
So, everybody, just calm down.
We'll get water now.

1353
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,229
(Jarmo) Yes!

1354
01:35:05,231 --> 01:35:07,594
(Paula) There's some chips
in there as well. So,
everybody will get some.

1355
01:35:07,596 --> 01:35:09,563
- (Woman) And chips?
- (Paula) And chips.

1356
01:35:09,565 --> 01:35:11,070
(Laughing)

1357
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:18,946
What's she doing?

1358
01:35:18,948 --> 01:35:21,873
What are you doing?
What's taking so long? Come on.

1359
01:35:24,712 --> 01:35:27,922
Just wait a minute. Just
back up. Back up a bit.

1360
01:35:28,791 --> 01:35:31,552
And the chips, Abigail.
Come on, everything out.

1361
01:35:31,554 --> 01:35:34,226
(Dimitry) Paula,
ask for food, yeah?

1362
01:35:34,228 --> 01:35:35,722
(Laughing)

1363
01:35:37,362 --> 01:35:39,890
- And the evian.
- Yes, ma'am Paula.

1364
01:35:42,236 --> 01:35:44,532
(Paula) Thank you.
And how many are you?

1365
01:35:44,534 --> 01:35:48,108
You're five? Just be patient.
Everyone will get...

1366
01:35:48,979 --> 01:35:50,473
Here you go.

1367
01:35:52,048 --> 01:35:53,508
There you go.

1368
01:35:54,544 --> 01:35:56,149
Please save it.

1369
01:36:05,754 --> 01:36:09,097
- (Jarmo) Are there more
boxes with water?
- (Paula) No, this is it.

1370
01:36:09,099 --> 01:36:11,297
- (Man) What's this?
- (Paula) It's a facial spray.

1371
01:36:11,299 --> 01:36:14,069
But you can drink it,
it's just water in a can.

1372
01:36:15,105 --> 01:36:18,371
Keep it close to your mouth,
so you won't waste it.

1373
01:36:22,804 --> 01:36:24,310
Here you go.

1374
01:36:24,979 --> 01:36:27,082
<i>(Therese shouting in distance)
In den wolken!</i>

1375
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:38,793
<i>In den wolken!</i>

1376
01:36:49,601 --> 01:36:51,107
Okay?

1377
01:37:17,367 --> 01:37:18,860
(Splashing)

1378
01:37:28,146 --> 01:37:31,247
- (Whooping)
- (Dimitry) Bravo!

1379
01:37:31,249 --> 01:37:34,316
- Bravo!
- Whoo!

1380
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:37,319
Crazy.

1381
01:37:41,952 --> 01:37:46,492
- Did she catch that
with her hands?
- (Paula) Good job, Abigail!

1382
01:37:47,892 --> 01:37:51,894
Good job! What is
that? An octopus?

1383
01:37:51,896 --> 01:37:54,172
- (Abigail) Octopus.
- Good!

1384
01:37:54,174 --> 01:37:57,274
- What do you think
we should do now?
- Fucking impressive.

1385
01:37:57,276 --> 01:37:59,836
- (Abigail) We need
to make a fire.

1386
01:37:59,838 --> 01:38:02,279
- (Paula) Of course we need to
make a fire.

1387
01:38:02,281 --> 01:38:03,642
Yes...

1388
01:38:05,317 --> 01:38:08,252
Do any of you know
how to make a fire?

1389
01:38:08,254 --> 01:38:09,516
What?

1390
01:38:09,518 --> 01:38:13,422
Do any of you know
how to make a fire?

1391
01:38:16,494 --> 01:38:17,987
- No?
- No!

1392
01:38:18,825 --> 01:38:20,627
- What?
- No!

1393
01:38:21,696 --> 01:38:25,303
Then you'll make the fire
after you're done fishing,
and then we should...

1394
01:38:25,305 --> 01:38:28,635
- (Abigail) We need to
clean the octopus.
- Of course we do.

1395
01:38:32,707 --> 01:38:36,281
Do any of you know
how to clean an octopus?

1396
01:38:36,283 --> 01:38:40,581
- (Dimitry) Huh?
- To clean an octopus!

1397
01:38:40,583 --> 01:38:42,649
Do you know how to do it?

1398
01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:53,397
(Abigail) Uh-huh...

1399
01:39:03,476 --> 01:39:05,377
One for you.

1400
01:39:06,280 --> 01:39:08,138
One for me.

1401
01:39:08,140 --> 01:39:09,677
One for you.

1402
01:39:10,384 --> 01:39:12,317
One for me.

1403
01:39:12,319 --> 01:39:14,144
One for you.

1404
01:39:14,146 --> 01:39:16,013
One for me.

1405
01:39:16,015 --> 01:39:17,818
One for you.

1406
01:39:17,820 --> 01:39:19,358
One for me.

1407
01:39:20,152 --> 01:39:21,293
One for you.

1408
01:39:21,989 --> 01:39:23,824
One for me.

1409
01:39:23,826 --> 01:39:27,201
One for you. One for me.

1410
01:39:27,632 --> 01:39:29,631
One for you.

1411
01:39:29,633 --> 01:39:31,238
For me.

1412
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:33,306
For you. For me.

1413
01:39:33,308 --> 01:39:35,901
For you.
For me.

1414
01:39:37,346 --> 01:39:39,641
- Uh-huh!
- (Paula) What?

1415
01:39:42,075 --> 01:39:43,778
What's that?

1416
01:39:45,683 --> 01:39:47,650
That's mine.

1417
01:39:47,652 --> 01:39:49,751
No, the big pile there?
What's that?

1418
01:39:49,753 --> 01:39:52,183
Mine. It's mine.

1419
01:39:52,185 --> 01:39:55,230
- All of this?
- Yes.

1420
01:39:56,166 --> 01:40:00,158
No. No, no, no...
Why do you get so much food?

1421
01:40:01,865 --> 01:40:03,128
Why?

1422
01:40:05,164 --> 01:40:07,033
(Sighs heavily)

1423
01:40:07,035 --> 01:40:08,968
I caught the fish.

1424
01:40:09,674 --> 01:40:11,872
- Yes?
- I made the fire.

1425
01:40:11,874 --> 01:40:13,742
- And?
- I cooked.

1426
01:40:13,744 --> 01:40:17,977
I did all the work.
And everybody got something.

1427
01:40:20,882 --> 01:40:22,289
Hmm...

1428
01:40:23,050 --> 01:40:26,358
No. No, we all... we all worked.

1429
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:28,525
What did you do?

1430
01:40:29,427 --> 01:40:33,090
We... gathered all the wood
for the fire.

1431
01:40:33,092 --> 01:40:35,729
- (Abigail snorts)
- I moved the log.

1432
01:40:35,731 --> 01:40:39,371
Yeah, this big log was
over there, and we
moved it over here.

1433
01:40:39,373 --> 01:40:41,031
Not enough.

1434
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:45,410
(Paula) No, maybe not enough,
but we need to work together.

1435
01:40:45,412 --> 01:40:49,611
- They don't know
how to do that.
- Exactly.

1436
01:40:51,417 --> 01:40:55,518
And maybe that's why you
should not be so lazy
and dependent on me.

1437
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:58,289
- (Dimitry mutters and chuckles)
- Uh-huh!

1438
01:41:17,233 --> 01:41:20,871
Abigail...
I think you're forgetting

1439
01:41:20,873 --> 01:41:24,611
that you and I are employees
of a big shipping company.

1440
01:41:24,613 --> 01:41:26,547
Remember?

1441
01:41:26,549 --> 01:41:30,110
In the end, I'm responsible
for the safety of the guests.

1442
01:41:30,112 --> 01:41:32,112
You have to do what I say.

1443
01:41:33,182 --> 01:41:36,886
We work on a yacht.
You are a toilet manager.

1444
01:41:36,888 --> 01:41:39,756
- You don't know
how to handle...
- What yacht?

1445
01:41:39,758 --> 01:41:41,891
- (Dimitry laughs)
- Where's the yacht?

1446
01:41:41,893 --> 01:41:44,959
You know this, Abigail,
I am a very rich man.

1447
01:41:44,961 --> 01:41:48,601
When we get back,
I can do good things for you.

1448
01:41:48,603 --> 01:41:51,064
I can make your
life easy and nice.

1449
01:41:51,066 --> 01:41:53,639
- (Abigail) When we get back?
- Yeah.

1450
01:41:53,641 --> 01:41:55,969
When we get back.
People are looking for us.

1451
01:41:55,971 --> 01:41:59,105
What, you think that
we'll stay here forever? What?

1452
01:41:59,107 --> 01:42:01,810
(Abigail laughs) You're funny.

1453
01:42:01,812 --> 01:42:05,276
This is not how you were
trained, Abigail. Please give...

1454
01:42:05,278 --> 01:42:07,421
(Dimitry) Whoa!

1455
01:42:09,623 --> 01:42:12,151
(Paula) Come on,
this is ridiculous.

1456
01:42:13,758 --> 01:42:17,023
You're scaring people.
Put the stick down.

1457
01:42:18,257 --> 01:42:19,729
(Dimitry) Hey!

1458
01:42:24,933 --> 01:42:26,570
Who am I?

1459
01:42:27,969 --> 01:42:30,476
- (Paula) Who are you?
- Who am I?

1460
01:42:30,478 --> 01:42:34,677
- You're the toilet manager.
- No.

1461
01:42:34,679 --> 01:42:39,385
On the yacht, toilet manager.
Here... captain. Who am I?

1462
01:42:43,522 --> 01:42:45,622
You're the captain.

1463
01:42:47,284 --> 01:42:48,525
Yes.

1464
01:42:51,497 --> 01:42:54,190
- Who am I?
- Captain.

1465
01:42:54,192 --> 01:42:57,324
- (Abigail) Very
good. Cutie pie?
- Captain.

1466
01:42:58,129 --> 01:43:00,636
- Who am I?
- Captain.

1467
01:43:00,638 --> 01:43:02,539
- Who am I?
- The captain.

1468
01:43:03,365 --> 01:43:05,541
- Who am I?
- (Mutters)

1469
01:43:09,371 --> 01:43:10,842
Who am I?

1470
01:43:12,879 --> 01:43:14,615
Who am I?

1471
01:43:23,956 --> 01:43:27,023
In the yacht, cleaning lady.
Here, captain.

1472
01:43:27,893 --> 01:43:29,399
Okay?

1473
01:43:32,470 --> 01:43:33,831
(Dimitry chuckles)

1474
01:43:43,579 --> 01:43:45,678
(Abigail) Have one more.

1475
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:47,174
Thank you.

1476
01:43:48,243 --> 01:43:50,342
(Dimitry) I would say, I agree.

1477
01:43:50,344 --> 01:43:54,246
I mean, er...
We have to work together.

1478
01:43:55,250 --> 01:43:58,756
And... create a good group.

1479
01:43:58,758 --> 01:44:00,384
Good society.

1480
01:44:00,386 --> 01:44:03,024
Do you know the saying,

1481
01:44:03,026 --> 01:44:06,390
"from each according
to his ability,

1482
01:44:06,392 --> 01:44:09,359
"to each according
to his needs"?

1483
01:44:12,265 --> 01:44:14,474
You don't know this?

1484
01:44:15,609 --> 01:44:17,301
Ma'am Paula...

1485
01:44:20,207 --> 01:44:25,682
With respect to your expertise
in this situation...

1486
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:31,083
I would like to make a
suggestion, if that's okay?

1487
01:44:32,383 --> 01:44:33,920
Sure.

1488
01:44:36,387 --> 01:44:39,465
My suggestion is that
the boys...

1489
01:44:40,765 --> 01:44:45,702
Stay here and watch the fire,
and take care of madame.

1490
01:44:45,704 --> 01:44:51,333
While you, ma'am Paula, and you
sleep with me in the lifeboat.

1491
01:44:55,647 --> 01:44:57,404
(Animal barks)

1492
01:45:01,686 --> 01:45:03,278
(Barking)

1493
01:45:05,624 --> 01:45:07,282
(Closer barking)

1494
01:45:18,492 --> 01:45:19,931
Thank you.

1495
01:45:25,334 --> 01:45:26,839
(Knocking)

1496
01:45:26,841 --> 01:45:29,237
(Dimitry) Hey,
Abigail, look this...

1497
01:45:30,174 --> 01:45:32,504
(Jarmo) I would give you
my patek Philippe.

1498
01:45:32,506 --> 01:45:35,012
(Dimitry) For one night in
the boat. Hey, Abigail...

1499
01:45:35,014 --> 01:45:37,619
- (Jarmo) 150 thousand Euros!
- (Abigail laughs)

1500
01:45:38,688 --> 01:45:42,656
- (Jarmo) Let us in.
- (Dimitry) For you...
Original rolex.

1501
01:45:49,522 --> 01:45:53,161
Nelson... she left the bag.

1502
01:45:54,032 --> 01:45:56,362
- What?
- She left the bag.

1503
01:45:59,532 --> 01:46:01,873
(Nelson) What's in it?

1504
01:46:12,478 --> 01:46:14,720
(Carl) Pretzel sticks.

1505
01:46:19,386 --> 01:46:23,564
- No, we can't have it.
- I'm just gonna have
a look. Alright?

1506
01:46:29,362 --> 01:46:32,562
- Nice!
- (Carl) We can't. No.

1507
01:46:32,564 --> 01:46:34,332
(Zips up bag)

1508
01:46:40,538 --> 01:46:42,307
- Wait...
- What are you doing?

1509
01:46:42,309 --> 01:46:43,814
Wait, wait, wait...

1510
01:46:50,514 --> 01:46:51,987
Maybe...

1511
01:46:54,925 --> 01:46:57,761
If we just make a
little hole here...

1512
01:46:58,563 --> 01:47:03,932
Take two out. One each.
They'll never notice it.

1513
01:47:03,934 --> 01:47:05,934
(Carl) Okay, let me try.

1514
01:47:09,598 --> 01:47:11,940
- Stop it, stop it, stop it...
- Now?

1515
01:47:24,546 --> 01:47:26,657
That was perfect!

1516
01:47:29,056 --> 01:47:32,222
- I don't wanna eat it!
I wanna save it!
- (Nelson) So good!

1517
01:47:34,226 --> 01:47:36,029
(Carl) Put it back.

1518
01:47:53,145 --> 01:47:54,474
(Carl) Hmm...

1519
01:48:00,824 --> 01:48:03,152
- Shall we just have one more?
- Yeah.

1520
01:48:03,154 --> 01:48:04,384
Yeah!

1521
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:17,771
Vera!

1522
01:48:22,877 --> 01:48:24,436
(Weeping)

1523
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:56,742
(Crow cawing)

1524
01:49:22,395 --> 01:49:24,802
So, what happened here?

1525
01:49:24,804 --> 01:49:27,562
Er... we made a mistake with...

1526
01:49:29,171 --> 01:49:31,170
(Abigail) Why?

1527
01:49:31,172 --> 01:49:33,337
We just fell asleep.

1528
01:49:33,339 --> 01:49:37,704
Now I won't have enough
time to go fish, because I
have to make another fire.

1529
01:49:39,049 --> 01:49:42,049
It takes a lot of work
to make a fire, you know.

1530
01:49:42,051 --> 01:49:43,887
Yeah, yeah. We know.

1531
01:49:47,649 --> 01:49:49,760
(Inaudible whispering)

1532
01:49:56,262 --> 01:49:57,492
(Sighs)

1533
01:50:00,332 --> 01:50:02,068
(Abigail) Okay.

1534
01:50:03,908 --> 01:50:07,204
Okay. Okay, okay.
Let's get this day started.

1535
01:50:07,206 --> 01:50:09,404
Come on, everybody. Let's go.

1536
01:50:11,179 --> 01:50:12,914
- Okay.
- Cool.

1537
01:50:12,916 --> 01:50:15,984
(Abigail) Wait, wait, wait.
There's one more thing.

1538
01:50:17,647 --> 01:50:21,957
Because, last night,
we left our backpack here,

1539
01:50:21,959 --> 01:50:25,289
and, well,
we're not very sure, but...

1540
01:50:25,291 --> 01:50:28,832
We think we're missing
a pack of pretzel sticks.

1541
01:50:29,967 --> 01:50:32,495
- You didn't take it, did you?
- No.

1542
01:50:32,497 --> 01:50:34,002
No.

1543
01:50:36,270 --> 01:50:38,468
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, we're sure! Come on.

1544
01:50:38,470 --> 01:50:41,978
- Why are we being accused?
- Oh, no, I'm not accusing you.

1545
01:50:41,980 --> 01:50:44,211
I'm just making sure, because...

1546
01:50:50,582 --> 01:50:51,955
What's this?

1547
01:50:53,993 --> 01:50:55,816
- Well, we didn't...
- You didn't?

1548
01:50:55,818 --> 01:50:57,289
- No.
- No, we didn't.

1549
01:50:57,291 --> 01:51:00,162
- And you're sure you didn't?
- We are sure we didn't.

1550
01:51:00,164 --> 01:51:02,098
- Very sure?
- Yes.

1551
01:51:05,300 --> 01:51:08,907
- I think they need
to be punished.
- Yes, ma'am Paula.

1552
01:51:11,802 --> 01:51:14,176
This is really bad.

1553
01:51:14,178 --> 01:51:16,573
This is really, really bad.

1554
01:51:17,643 --> 01:51:19,577
(Carl) Oh, come on...

1555
01:51:19,579 --> 01:51:21,744
I mean, you didn't
watch the fire.

1556
01:51:21,746 --> 01:51:24,220
And then you steal
a pack of pretzel sticks?

1557
01:51:24,222 --> 01:51:27,157
- Yeah, and lie about it.
- We deserved it.

1558
01:51:27,159 --> 01:51:30,226
(Abigail) And not just to me,
to everybody here.

1559
01:51:32,032 --> 01:51:34,230
How can we trust you,
after what you did?

1560
01:51:34,232 --> 01:51:36,694
I need to say something
now, because this is
becoming ridiculous.

1561
01:51:36,696 --> 01:51:41,105
- No, let me say
something, Abigail.
- (Abigail) Did you see that?

1562
01:51:41,107 --> 01:51:42,942
What?

1563
01:51:42,944 --> 01:51:46,077
Don't point at her.
Put your hands down.

1564
01:51:47,379 --> 01:51:50,984
- Okay, alright, just
let me say, though...
- (Abigail) Put your hands down!

1565
01:51:51,612 --> 01:51:53,183
What?

1566
01:51:53,185 --> 01:51:56,055
(Yaya) Your body language
is so aggressive, Carl!

1567
01:51:56,057 --> 01:51:59,223
- What?
- (Abigail) I'm not getting
any food for you.

1568
01:51:59,225 --> 01:52:02,853
- You find your own food.
- What? Come on, man...

1569
01:52:02,855 --> 01:52:06,230
- No, Abigail, that's so unfair!
- Put your hands down.

1570
01:52:06,232 --> 01:52:09,662
You seriously don't get it.
Put your hands down!

1571
01:52:09,664 --> 01:52:13,369
- I'm trying to defend myself.
- Don't defend yourself!

1572
01:52:13,371 --> 01:52:17,373
You are inflicting pain on her
by defending yourself.

1573
01:52:35,229 --> 01:52:37,934
Shut the fuck up! No...

1574
01:52:40,366 --> 01:52:41,860
No!

1575
01:53:09,429 --> 01:53:11,792
(Dimitry) Hey! Ha-ha!

1576
01:53:13,071 --> 01:53:16,006
Oh... hey.

1577
01:53:16,932 --> 01:53:19,900
- What a nice fish, huh?
- Yes.

1578
01:53:19,902 --> 01:53:22,078
- Wow!
- We have a lot.

1579
01:53:22,971 --> 01:53:25,576
So it's dinner, huh? Great.

1580
01:53:27,317 --> 01:53:30,911
- Where did you get it?
- There, at the
back of the rock.

1581
01:53:32,156 --> 01:53:34,993
- You're good at that.
- Thank you.

1582
01:53:38,657 --> 01:53:40,163
You need help?

1583
01:53:40,165 --> 01:53:43,528
Yeah, sure, get some Nutella.
(Laughs)

1584
01:54:05,851 --> 01:54:07,752
Oh, thank you!

1585
01:55:27,442 --> 01:55:29,375
(Yaya) What?

1586
01:55:40,751 --> 01:55:44,292
- Yaya? Wait, wait!
- Dickhead! Piss off!

1587
01:55:44,294 --> 01:55:46,195
(Metallic clanging)

1588
01:56:01,136 --> 01:56:02,673
(Sighs)

1589
01:56:06,141 --> 01:56:09,484
(Abigail) Okay, I'm going
to the lifeboat now.

1590
01:56:09,486 --> 01:56:12,651
Ma'am Paula, can you stay here
and watch the fire?

1591
01:56:12,653 --> 01:56:14,115
Sure.

1592
01:56:16,988 --> 01:56:21,859
And since Carl didn't eat
anything today, he can sleep
with me in the lifeboat.

1593
01:56:23,830 --> 01:56:25,402
Okay. Yeah.

1594
01:56:27,834 --> 01:56:29,472
(Dimitry chuckles)

1595
01:56:30,641 --> 01:56:34,839
- (Nelson) Can I come?
- (Carl) Abigail, can
we both come or...?

1596
01:56:34,841 --> 01:56:37,216
(Abigail) No, just you.

1597
01:56:40,353 --> 01:56:44,146
- (Yaya) Fine, I'll
take the pretzels!
- (Carl) Eh?

1598
01:56:48,658 --> 01:56:50,560
You're making this
into an issue.

1599
01:56:50,562 --> 01:56:52,859
Are you going to take them?
Yes, take them. Good.

1600
01:56:52,861 --> 01:56:56,192
- Why are you making
this into an issue?
- (Whistle blowing)

1601
01:56:56,194 --> 01:56:58,371
I'm coming! One second!

1602
01:57:04,478 --> 01:57:08,171
- What are you gonna
do on the boat?
- I don't know.

1603
01:57:09,879 --> 01:57:11,647
Don't act naive, seriously!

1604
01:57:11,649 --> 01:57:13,880
I don't know why she
asked me, but I'm gonna
do it, of course...

1605
01:57:13,882 --> 01:57:15,455
- Really?
- Yes.

1606
01:57:15,457 --> 01:57:17,984
What do you think
she wants with you?

1607
01:57:17,986 --> 01:57:20,690
You're a young, hot guy.
What do you think she's
going to do with you?

1608
01:57:20,692 --> 01:57:22,330
(Whistle blowing)

1609
01:57:22,332 --> 01:57:24,694
- Okay, then give them back...
- No. No!

1610
01:57:24,696 --> 01:57:27,697
- Let me take them back.
- No. And they're mine, okay?

1611
01:57:27,699 --> 01:57:30,271
Take a few, and I'll take them
back, cos I don't wanna do this.

1612
01:57:30,273 --> 01:57:32,131
- It's not a good idea.
- I want these!

1613
01:57:32,133 --> 01:57:36,707
You need to tell me what
to do! You need to tell
me how to navigate this.

1614
01:57:36,709 --> 01:57:38,446
(Whistle blowing)

1615
01:57:42,419 --> 01:57:43,846
Yaya?

1616
01:57:47,523 --> 01:57:50,183
You just have to stroke her ego.

1617
01:57:53,254 --> 01:57:56,728
Just... laugh at her jokes.

1618
01:57:56,730 --> 01:57:59,193
- And... and smile.
- Mm-hmm...

1619
01:58:00,262 --> 01:58:01,700
Okay.

1620
01:58:01,702 --> 01:58:04,605
- Make sure to
set up boundaries.
- Yeah.

1621
01:58:04,607 --> 01:58:08,609
- And nothing sexual, okay?
- No, I won't do
anything sexual.

1622
01:58:09,205 --> 01:58:10,579
Mm-hmm...

1623
01:58:10,581 --> 01:58:12,415
And don't do anything
you wouldn't want me to do.

1624
01:58:12,417 --> 01:58:14,616
No, I won't do anything
you're not comfortable with.

1625
01:58:14,618 --> 01:58:17,652
No kissing. Nothing like that!

1626
01:58:21,921 --> 01:58:24,053
Yaya, I think she's probably
expecting something.

1627
01:58:25,794 --> 01:58:28,993
- Like what?
- I don't know... I, er...

1628
01:58:30,128 --> 01:58:32,029
- A massage, or...
- A massage?

1629
01:58:32,031 --> 01:58:34,966
- I don't know. She
might want something.
- Definitely not a massage!

1630
01:58:34,968 --> 01:58:37,475
She just gave me a whole fucking
packet of pretzels for you...

1631
01:58:37,477 --> 01:58:39,971
I don't know what to say...
I can't do anything?

1632
01:58:39,973 --> 01:58:41,742
- No!
- Okay, but...

1633
01:58:41,744 --> 01:58:44,614
- Massage her neck. Okay?
- I can massage her neck?

1634
01:58:44,616 --> 01:58:47,077
- Her neck, that's it!
- Okay, okay, okay...

1635
01:58:49,423 --> 01:58:51,181
Okay.

1636
01:58:53,318 --> 01:58:55,823
- I love you so much.
- Well, I hate you.

1637
01:58:55,825 --> 01:58:58,254
I understand! Fuck...

1638
01:58:58,991 --> 01:59:01,632
- (Whistle blowing)
- Yeah... coming!

1639
01:59:05,935 --> 01:59:07,638
(Yaya weeping)

1640
01:59:19,455 --> 01:59:21,521
- See you in a bit.
- Morning.

1641
01:59:22,524 --> 01:59:24,919
- Oh, morning.
- Asshole.

1642
01:59:26,397 --> 01:59:29,287
Yaya!
Yaya, wait. Wait.

1643
01:59:36,362 --> 01:59:39,265
- (Dimitry) Hey, you!
- (Indistinct voices)

1644
02:00:12,335 --> 02:00:14,643
- See you later.
- (Abigail) Okay.

1645
02:00:14,645 --> 02:00:18,173
(Man) Pirate! Pirate! He's
coming! He got caught!

1646
02:00:18,175 --> 02:00:19,581
(Laughing)

1647
02:00:20,242 --> 02:00:21,846
(Blows whistle)

1648
02:00:23,146 --> 02:00:24,915
Disgusting.

1649
02:00:24,917 --> 02:00:26,916
What?

1650
02:00:38,533 --> 02:00:40,665
(Carl) What the fuck?

1651
02:00:41,701 --> 02:00:43,734
Oh, fucking hell...

1652
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:51,400
(Banging)

1653
02:00:52,711 --> 02:00:53,973
(Whistle blowing)

1654
02:00:55,746 --> 02:00:57,680
(Chuckling)

1655
02:00:58,143 --> 02:00:59,912
(Blows whistle)

1656
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:04,455
- Pretty boy!
- We can see you!

1657
02:01:15,665 --> 02:01:19,127
Have you ever used your...
When you were young?

1658
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:21,561
In den wolken.

1659
02:01:21,933 --> 02:01:24,263
Oh, you slept with somebody
to get a job?

1660
02:01:24,397 --> 02:01:25,648
Nein, nein, nein!

1661
02:01:35,408 --> 02:01:37,441
No, you didn't?

1662
02:01:37,443 --> 02:01:40,146
Really? Once?

1663
02:01:40,148 --> 02:01:42,214
(Nelson speaks French)
Once doesn't count.

1664
02:01:45,483 --> 02:01:48,285
Therese... wow!

1665
02:01:50,828 --> 02:01:52,421
(Blows whistle)

1666
02:01:53,291 --> 02:01:55,489
(Carl) Where is it?

1667
02:01:55,491 --> 02:01:58,767
- Give it to me!
- Take it! Take it.

1668
02:02:02,002 --> 02:02:04,970
You're acting like children.
Give me the whistle!

1669
02:02:04,972 --> 02:02:07,037
Give me the whistle now!

1670
02:02:09,647 --> 02:02:11,371
So childish!

1671
02:02:11,373 --> 02:02:13,549
(Dimitry mimics whistle)

1672
02:02:34,327 --> 02:02:36,734
(Animal braying and snorting)

1673
02:02:41,201 --> 02:02:42,872
Hey...

1674
02:02:42,874 --> 02:02:45,434
- Pirate? What was it?
- Did you see it?

1675
02:02:45,436 --> 02:02:48,007
- What was it?
- I don't know what it is.

1676
02:02:51,782 --> 02:02:55,476
- What's going on?
- They're hunting something.

1677
02:02:59,789 --> 02:03:04,021
(Nelson) No. We don't go there.
What?

1678
02:03:04,023 --> 02:03:06,188
- Come on, guys!
- Shh!

1679
02:03:12,801 --> 02:03:14,966
Nelson, give me that.

1680
02:03:16,903 --> 02:03:19,232
(Nelson) Are you sure?

1681
02:03:33,180 --> 02:03:34,917
(Animal braying)

1682
02:03:37,019 --> 02:03:38,513
Fuck...

1683
02:03:45,224 --> 02:03:47,059
It's a female.

1684
02:03:48,127 --> 02:03:49,765
Kill it.

1685
02:03:51,229 --> 02:03:53,262
(Animal braying)

1686
02:04:02,108 --> 02:04:04,273
(Jarmo shouts)

1687
02:04:06,948 --> 02:04:09,376
- Whoo!
- Ya!

1688
02:04:09,378 --> 02:04:11,543
(Men shouting)

1689
02:04:15,053 --> 02:04:17,955
It's moving. It's moving.

1690
02:04:17,957 --> 02:04:20,727
- What?
- It's not dead. It's not dead.

1691
02:04:20,729 --> 02:04:23,928
- It's moving.
- It's not dead.

1692
02:04:23,930 --> 02:04:26,226
(Braying)

1693
02:04:26,962 --> 02:04:29,162
- (Nelson) What's he doing?
- (Paula) No, no, no.

1694
02:04:30,627 --> 02:04:32,627
(Nelson) Ah, again! Do it again!

1695
02:04:32,629 --> 02:04:35,036
(Braying in pain)

1696
02:04:38,073 --> 02:04:40,469
(Thudding and braying)

1697
02:04:43,441 --> 02:04:46,717
<i>Jarmo! Jarmo... La tempe.</i>

1698
02:04:48,610 --> 02:04:50,511
(Breathing heavily)

1699
02:04:54,648 --> 02:04:56,659
Hey, you did it!

1700
02:05:06,934 --> 02:05:11,838
Hunter jarmo! Big
hunter! Come on!

1701
02:05:11,840 --> 02:05:16,468
- Give him applause! Hey!
- (All chant) Jarmo!
Jarmo! Jarmo...

1702
02:05:18,671 --> 02:05:22,673
- (Dimitry) Big donkey hunt!
- Come on, speech!

1703
02:05:22,675 --> 02:05:26,018
- (Jarmo) Okay, okay!
- The donkey fairytale...

1704
02:05:26,020 --> 02:05:29,020
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!
- (Jarmo) Thank you very much.

1705
02:05:29,022 --> 02:05:34,961
Okay... to kill a donkey,
it may be a great achievement.

1706
02:05:34,963 --> 02:05:37,996
But there's one thing
that's so much greater.

1707
02:05:37,998 --> 02:05:41,461
- (Yaya) To paint!
- To paint, yes!

1708
02:05:42,134 --> 02:05:45,200
To paint a donkey!

1709
02:05:45,202 --> 02:05:48,040
- (Yaya) Yes!
- (All cheering)

1710
02:05:49,141 --> 02:05:50,536
(Whooping)

1711
02:05:51,205 --> 02:05:53,407
(Jarmo) Let's take a look
at the expression.

1712
02:05:53,409 --> 02:05:56,081
- Who did this one?
- (Yaya) Me.

1713
02:05:56,083 --> 02:05:59,479
Okay, the feet are
close, close together.

1714
02:05:59,481 --> 02:06:02,890
This donkey wants
to be in control.

1715
02:06:02,892 --> 02:06:06,354
But it looks almost scared.

1716
02:06:07,159 --> 02:06:09,424
You want to tell
this donkey to...

1717
02:06:10,426 --> 02:06:12,327
To not be so scared.

1718
02:06:12,329 --> 02:06:17,365
To lose control and bound away
across the fields,

1719
02:06:17,367 --> 02:06:20,269
wildly waving its tail!

1720
02:06:21,272 --> 02:06:24,780
- Sure, it will make mistakes...
- Carl, what are you doing?

1721
02:06:28,675 --> 02:06:29,949
Huh?

1722
02:06:31,415 --> 02:06:33,547
- (Yaya) Carl?
- Yeah.

1723
02:06:36,090 --> 02:06:38,387
What are you doing
with your hand?

1724
02:06:41,095 --> 02:06:44,162
- (Carl) Which one?
- Seriously?

1725
02:06:48,696 --> 02:06:50,971
I'm just resting
it on the chair.

1726
02:06:53,108 --> 02:06:56,470
Why is your hand
under her jacket on a chair?

1727
02:06:58,112 --> 02:06:59,705
(Carl) What...?

1728
02:07:00,607 --> 02:07:02,917
It was just...
I don't know, it was there,

1729
02:07:02,919 --> 02:07:05,711
resting on the side
of... the chair.

1730
02:07:20,971 --> 02:07:22,431
(Distant thunder)

1731
02:07:28,671 --> 02:07:31,737
(Abigail) I'm coming.
I'm coming!

1732
02:07:33,048 --> 02:07:34,773
I'm coming...

1733
02:07:34,775 --> 02:07:37,578
- Oh, I can't concentrate...
- Oh, god!

1734
02:07:53,530 --> 02:07:55,563
Okay, you know...

1735
02:07:55,565 --> 02:07:59,270
If you can't handle it,
just tell me, nobody's
forcing you to do anything.

1736
02:07:59,272 --> 02:08:03,340
It's just all this fucking
sneaking around and hiding
things from everyone.

1737
02:08:03,342 --> 02:08:06,641
It's too much. It's...
It's becoming unbearable.

1738
02:08:06,643 --> 02:08:10,479
I mean, they're obviously
not happy with what
we're doing in here.

1739
02:08:12,891 --> 02:08:17,321
Okay, so... let's just...
Tell them the truth.

1740
02:08:20,657 --> 02:08:26,001
You give me something, and I
give you something in return.

1741
02:08:31,107 --> 02:08:33,734
You realize what position
that puts me in?

1742
02:08:34,836 --> 02:08:36,143
No.

1743
02:08:37,839 --> 02:08:41,984
Well, just because it's
more open that you're
a flesh peddler,

1744
02:08:41,986 --> 02:08:43,843
it doesn't mean
they're gonna accept the fact

1745
02:08:43,845 --> 02:08:46,548
that you're buying sex
with the common food.

1746
02:08:47,223 --> 02:08:49,091
Wow...

1747
02:08:50,193 --> 02:08:51,785
Oh, come on, I didn't...

1748
02:08:51,787 --> 02:08:54,227
Do you know the amount of work
I put into this island?

1749
02:08:54,229 --> 02:08:57,395
- I go fishing every day,
I make fire...
- I know, I know.

1750
02:08:57,397 --> 02:09:00,035
- I'm responsible
for everybody here!
- I know, I'm sorry, I know.

1751
02:09:00,037 --> 02:09:04,172
- Shouldn't that give
me an advantage?
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

1752
02:09:04,174 --> 02:09:07,911
- Okay!
- You deserve to do
what you want, I know.

1753
02:09:15,877 --> 02:09:18,878
The absurd thing is that,
if we were a couple,

1754
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:21,749
they wouldn't care
what we did in here.

1755
02:09:24,589 --> 02:09:28,426
But, really, maybe we
should just do that, maybe
we should just get on with it.

1756
02:09:28,428 --> 02:09:31,429
I don't know, kiss a little
bit in public and hold hands.

1757
02:09:31,431 --> 02:09:34,202
- Surely that would be easier?
- What about yaya?

1758
02:09:34,204 --> 02:09:38,272
I would have a conversation
with yaya. I would have to
be an adult about it.

1759
02:09:38,274 --> 02:09:43,046
And figure it out, but...
I think it would be easier
for her, probably.

1760
02:09:43,048 --> 02:09:45,774
I mean, she's having to deal
with all this gossip as well.

1761
02:09:45,776 --> 02:09:48,117
Carl, I... I don't know.

1762
02:09:56,621 --> 02:09:59,094
Do you want me
to break up with yaya?

1763
02:09:59,096 --> 02:10:00,789
- No.
- No?

1764
02:10:02,925 --> 02:10:05,497
That's your decision, not mine.

1765
02:10:08,306 --> 02:10:12,439
I'm not asking you to do it,
I'm just seeing what
you think about it.

1766
02:10:12,441 --> 02:10:16,115
I know, but that doesn't
mean that you can put me
in-between the two of you.

1767
02:10:16,117 --> 02:10:17,644
Okay, okay.

1768
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:28,492
It's kind of a perfect
scenario for you, I mean...

1769
02:10:29,991 --> 02:10:32,333
You get what you want,
you have no obligations,

1770
02:10:32,335 --> 02:10:34,664
no responsibilities, you know.

1771
02:10:34,666 --> 02:10:36,832
Why do you have to make
everything so complicated?

1772
02:10:36,834 --> 02:10:40,375
Because I feel like I
need to know where
this is going, Abigail.

1773
02:10:42,809 --> 02:10:44,842
Let's just have fun.

1774
02:10:44,844 --> 02:10:47,186
No, but I need to try to deal
with this situation.

1775
02:10:47,188 --> 02:10:49,288
I... I don't wanna piss off...

1776
02:10:51,522 --> 02:10:53,886
I don't wanna annoy
anyone anymore.

1777
02:10:56,199 --> 02:10:59,959
Do you remember what you said
the first night you were here?

1778
02:10:59,961 --> 02:11:01,797
What did you say?

1779
02:11:03,868 --> 02:11:06,704
"I love you, you give me fish."

1780
02:11:06,706 --> 02:11:08,377
Exactly.

1781
02:11:08,379 --> 02:11:11,711
And do you know why
that is so beautiful?

1782
02:11:11,713 --> 02:11:13,317
- No.
- Like you...

1783
02:11:13,319 --> 02:11:15,814
- Why?
- Because it's the truth.

1784
02:11:20,922 --> 02:11:23,989
So, Nelson... you're
a pirate, huh?

1785
02:11:25,401 --> 02:11:27,235
Come on, stop it.

1786
02:11:27,579 --> 02:11:28,831
In den wolken?

1787
02:11:29,339 --> 02:11:32,604
Okay. If I was a pirate,
what would you ask me?

1788
02:11:32,606 --> 02:11:35,080
How much money do you make?

1789
02:11:36,414 --> 02:11:38,249
Yeah, of course.

1790
02:11:38,251 --> 02:11:41,615
I don't know,
like... 3,000 Euros.

1791
02:11:41,617 --> 02:11:43,915
- On one attack?
- Yeah, one attack.

1792
02:11:44,752 --> 02:11:46,522
If we succeed.

1793
02:11:47,460 --> 02:11:50,594
So, you work on commission, huh?

1794
02:11:50,596 --> 02:11:52,595
- Yeah.
- Shit!

1795
02:11:52,597 --> 02:11:55,027
The client is making all money?

1796
02:11:55,829 --> 02:11:59,176
Yeah, but you can make more
if you have your own boat.

1797
02:12:01,576 --> 02:12:05,150
3,000 Euros...
Come on, you're crazy.

1798
02:12:06,109 --> 02:12:08,582
My girlfriend is expensive.

1799
02:12:08,584 --> 02:12:11,323
What? You invest in
your girlfriend?

1800
02:12:11,325 --> 02:12:13,424
- Yeah.
- Ah...

1801
02:12:13,426 --> 02:12:16,087
You should do it
the other way around.

1802
02:12:16,089 --> 02:12:19,465
Invest in business, buy a boat,
and the girls will come to you.

1803
02:12:19,467 --> 02:12:20,663
Yeah?

1804
02:12:21,266 --> 02:12:23,600
(Dimitry) Sure, I know. Ha-ha!

1805
02:12:23,602 --> 02:12:25,439
(Knocking)

1806
02:12:34,353 --> 02:12:36,419
(Insistent knocking)

1807
02:12:39,359 --> 02:12:41,261
Hey.

1808
02:12:41,263 --> 02:12:44,198
I was just wondering
if I could borrow the backpack.

1809
02:12:44,200 --> 02:12:46,927
- Abigail?
- (Abigail) Yeah, I know.

1810
02:12:46,929 --> 02:12:48,598
- What are you going
to do, yaya?

1811
02:12:48,600 --> 02:12:50,305
- Go for a hike over
the mountain.

1812
02:12:50,307 --> 02:12:52,538
See if I can find something.

1813
02:12:55,807 --> 02:12:59,678
- (Abigail) I'll go with you.
- It's okay, I can go by myself.

1814
02:12:59,680 --> 02:13:03,585
No, yaya, it's not safe for you
to go alone. I'll go with you.

1815
02:13:04,884 --> 02:13:06,424
Okay.

1816
02:13:10,825 --> 02:13:14,895
- Do you want me to come?
- No. You stay here.

1817
02:13:14,897 --> 02:13:17,030
I need some time alone with her.

1818
02:13:17,032 --> 02:13:18,603
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1819
02:13:24,612 --> 02:13:26,481
(Yaya) I'll take it.

1820
02:13:54,352 --> 02:13:56,617
I'm glad we're doing
this together, yaya.

1821
02:13:58,588 --> 02:14:00,082
Me, too.

1822
02:14:00,884 --> 02:14:03,460
I actually wanted
to tell you that i'm...

1823
02:14:03,462 --> 02:14:06,398
Really impressed by
everything you're doing here.

1824
02:14:07,235 --> 02:14:11,063
I mean, you managed to run
a fucking matriarchy, Abigail.

1825
02:14:11,065 --> 02:14:12,570
(Laughing)

1826
02:14:18,778 --> 02:14:21,944
You domesticated
all the old Alpha males.

1827
02:14:21,946 --> 02:14:23,452
Yeah!

1828
02:14:26,215 --> 02:14:27,655
Thank you.

1829
02:14:31,464 --> 02:14:33,563
No, it's really impressive.

1830
02:14:41,608 --> 02:14:44,104
We should stick together, huh?

1831
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:11,577
Oh, my god...

1832
02:15:14,515 --> 02:15:17,384
I think it should be
a little easier from here.

1833
02:15:38,503 --> 02:15:40,964
(Man singing in distance)

1834
02:15:53,433 --> 02:15:54,684
In den wolken!

1835
02:15:57,436 --> 02:15:59,396

You must be excited
to see your kids, huh?

I don't know how, but...

1890
02:22:13,043 --> 02:22:17,671
Abigail... maybe you can come
and work for me?

1891
02:22:18,139 --> 02:22:20,211
You could be my assistant.

1892
02:22:27,384 --> 02:22:28,889
