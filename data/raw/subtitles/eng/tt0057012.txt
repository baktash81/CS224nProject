1
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:45,378
For more than a year, ominous
rumors had been circulating...

2
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,797
...among high-level
Western leaders...

3
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:51,801
...that the Soviet Union had been at
work on what was hinted to be...

4
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:55,596
...the ultimate weapon:
a doomsday device.

5
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:59,559
Intelligence sources traced the site
of the top-secret Russian project...

6
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:02,311
...to the perpetually fog-shrouded
wasteland...

7
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,064
...below the Arctic peaks
of the Zhokhov Islands.

8
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:05,773
...below the Arctic peaks
of the Zhokhov Islands.

9
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,275
What they were building...

10
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:11,154
...or why it should be located in such
a remote and desolate place...

11
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,614
...no one could say.

12
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:47,268
-General Ripper, sir.
-Group Captain Mandrake speaking.

13
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,438
-This is General Ripper speaking.
-Yes, sir.

14
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:54,317
-Do you recognize my voice?
-I do, sir. Why do you ask?

15
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,152
Why do you think I ask?

16
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,822
Well, I don't know, sir. We spoke
just a few moments ago, didn't we?

17
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:05,161
You don't think I'd ask unless it was
pretty damned important, do you?

18
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:08,998
-No, I don't, sir, no.
-Let's see if we can stay on the ball.

19
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,460
Has the wing confirmed holding
at their fail-safe points?

20
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:15,338
Yes, sir. The confirmations
have all just come in.

21
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:18,925
Very well.
Now, listen to me carefully.

22
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,636
The base is being
put on condition red.

23
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,263
I want this flashed
to all sections immediately.

24
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,642
Condition red. Jolly good idea.
Keeps the men on their toes.

25
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,977
I'm afraid this is not an exercise.

26
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:32,939
Not an exercise, sir?

27
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:39,153
I shouldn't tell you this, but you're a
good officer and have a right to know.

28
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,280
It looks like
we're in a shooting war.

29
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,033
Oh, hell.

30
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,203
-Are the Russians involved?
-That's all I've been told.

31
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:52,166
It came in on the red phone. I'm gonna
follow orders and seal this base tight.

32
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,712
Now, I want you to
transmit Plan R...

33
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,714
...R for Robert, to the wing.

34
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:02,176
-Plan R for Robert.
-Is it that bad, sir?

35
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,720
-Looks like it's pretty hairy.
-Yes, sir.

36
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,847
Plan R for Robert, sir.

37
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:10,226
Now, last, and possibly
most important...

38
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:14,355
...I want all privately-owned radios
to be immediately impounded.

39
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:18,192
They might be used to issue
instructions to saboteurs.

40
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,737
As I previously arranged, Air Police
will have lists of all owners.

41
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:25,574
I want every single one of them
collected without exception.

42
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,035
After you've done that,
report back to me.

43
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,732
In order to guard against
surprise nuclear attack...

44
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,775
...America's
Strategic Air Command...

45
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,737
...maintains a large force
of B-52 bombers...

46
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,406
...airborne 24 hours a day.

47
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:10,411
Each B-52 can deliver a nuclear
bomb load of 50 megatons...

48
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:16,042
...equal to 16 times the total explosive
force of all the bombs and shells...

49
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,962
...used by all the armies
in World War ll.

50
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,757
Based in America,
the Airborne Alert Force...

51
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,885
...is deployed from the Persian Gulf
to the Arctic Ocean.

52
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:29,096
But they have one geographical factor
in common:

53
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:33,142
They are all two hours
from their targets inside Russia.

54
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,975
Major Kong, I know you'll think
this is crazy...

55
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,728
...but I just got a message from base
over the CRM 114.

56
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:04,817
It decodes as wing attack Plan R.
R for Romeo.

57
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,488
Goldie, did you say
wing attack Plan R?

58
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,116
Goldie, did you say
wing attack Plan R?

59
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,868
Yes, sir, I have.

60
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:20,708
Goldie, how many times have
I told you guys...

61
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,878
...that I don't want
no horsing around on the airplane?

62
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,714
I'm not horsing around, sir,
that's how it decodes.

63
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:29,884
Well, I've been to one world fair,
a picnic and a rodeo...

64
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,387
...and that's the stupidest thing
I ever heard over earphones.

65
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,389
You sure you got today's code?

66
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:37,933
Yes, sir, it is.

67
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,561
There's just gotta be
something wrong.

68
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,063
Wait a second, I'm coming back.

69
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:20,893
Maybe you'd better get
a confirmation from base.

70
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,686
Yes, sir.

71
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,002
Major Kong, is it possible
this is some kind of loyalty test?

72
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:50,506
Give the go code and then recall
to see who would actually go?

73
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,592
Ain't nobody ever got
the go code yet.

74
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,301
Ain't nobody ever got
the go code yet.

75
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,595
Old Ripper wouldn't be giving us
Plan R...

76
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,348
...unless them Russkies had
clobbered Washington...

77
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,976
...and a lot of other towns
with a sneak attack.

78
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,185
Yes, sir.

79
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,813
Major Kong, message
from base confirmed.

80
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,529
Well, boys, I reckon this is it.

81
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:17,616
Nuclear combat toe-to-toe
with the Russkies.

82
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:37,344
Now, look, boys, I ain't much
of a hand at making speeches.

83
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:41,974
But I got a pretty fair idea
that something doggone important...

84
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,726
...is going on back there.

85
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:48,564
Now, I've got a fair idea of the kind
of personal emotions...

86
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:51,233
...that some of you fellows
may be thinking.

87
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,361
Heck, I reckon you wouldn't even be
human beings...

88
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:59,033
...if you didn't have strong personal
feelings about nuclear combat.

89
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,702
But I want you to remember
one thing:

90
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,538
That folks back home
is counting on you...

91
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,207
...and by golly,
we ain't about to let them down.

92
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,669
Tell you something else.

93
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:16,175
If this thing turns out to be half as
important as I figure it just might be...

94
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:20,763
...I'd say that you're all in line
for some important promotions...

95
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,058
...and personal citations
when this thing's over with.

96
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,102
And that goes for
every last one of you...

97
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,898
...regardless of your race,
color or your creed.

98
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:34,735
Now, let's get this thing on the hump.
We got some flying to do.

99
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,584
Buck, should I get it?

100
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,628
Yeah, you have to.

101
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,094
Hello?

102
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,096
Yes, General Turgidson is here...

103
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,765
...he can't come
to the phone at the moment.

104
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,142
Well, this is his secretary,
Miss Scott.

105
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,437
Freddie, how are you?

106
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,773
Fine, and you?

107
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:17,069
Oh, we were just catching up
on some of the general's paperwork.

108
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:20,322
Well, look, Freddie, he's tied up
at the moment.

109
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,325
I'm afraid
he can't come to the phone.

110
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,743
Just a minute.

111
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:28,080
General Turgidson,
a Colonel Puntrich calling.

112
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,082
Tell him to call back.

113
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,837
Freddie, the general says could you
call back in a minute or two?

114
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,839
He says it can't wait.

115
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,259
For Pete's--
Find out what he wants.

116
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:44,179
Freddie, the thing is, the general
is in the powder room right now.

117
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,640
Could you tell me what it's about?

118
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:48,851
Just a second.

119
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,146
Apparently they monitored
a transmission eight minutes ago...

120
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,190
...from Burpelson Air Force Base.

121
00:12:56,526 --> 00:13:01,655
Right. It was directed to the
843rd bomb wing on airborne alert.

122
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,827
It decoded as wing attack Plan R.

123
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:12,458
Well, tell him to call what's-his-name,
the base commander. Ripper.

124
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,293
Do I have to think of everything?

125
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:18,964
The general suggests you call General
Ripper, the 843rd base commander.

126
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,384
All communications are dead.

127
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,888
Bull! Tell him to do it himself.

128
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:30,476
Freddie, the general asks if
you could possibly try again yourself.

129
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,647
I see. He says he's tried personally
several times, but everything is dead.

130
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:39,193
Even the normal phone lines
are shut down.

131
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,660
Fred? Buck. What's it look like?

132
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,705
Yeah?

133
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:56,084
Well, are you sure it's Plan R?

134
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:02,925
What's cooking on the threat board?
Nothing? Nothing at all?

135
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,596
I don't like the look of this, Fred.

136
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:11,058
Tell you what you better do,
old buddy.

137
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:14,603
Give Elmo and Charlie a blast.
Bump everything up to condition red.

138
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,064
Stand by the blower.
I'll get back to you.

139
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,399
-What's up?
-Nothing, nothing.

140
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,238
-Where's my shorts?
-On the floor. Where are you going?

141
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,073
No place.

142
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:30,869
I thought I might mosey over to the
war room, see what's doing over there.

143
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,746
It's 3:00 in the morning.

144
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,748
The Air Force never sleeps.

145
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:38,794
Buck, honey, I'm not sleepy either.

146
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:44,216
I know how it is, baby.

147
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,385
Tell you what you do.

148
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:51,306
You just start your countdown
and old Bucky will be back here...

149
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:55,018
...before you can say, "Blastoff!"

150
00:14:56,271 --> 00:15:01,316
Your Commie has no regard
for human life, not even his own.

151
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:04,444
And for this reason, men,
I want to impress upon you...

152
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,406
...the need
for extreme watchfulness.

153
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:11,618
The enemy may come individually
or he may come in strength.

154
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,454
He may even come in the uniform
of our own troops.

155
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,833
But however he comes,
we must stop him.

156
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:21,753
We must not allow him
to gain entrance to this base.

157
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:26,133
Now, I am going to give you
three simple rules.

158
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:30,679
First: trust no one,
whatever his uniform or rank...

159
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,307
...unless he is known
to you personally.

160
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,184
Second: anyone or anything...

161
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:41,189
...that approaches within 200 yards
of the perimeter is to be fired upon.

162
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:46,862
Third: if in doubt, shoot first
and ask questions afterwards.

163
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:50,324
I would sooner accept
a few casualties through accident...

164
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:54,536
...than lose the entire base and
its personnel through carelessness.

165
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:59,291
Any variation on these rules
must come from me personally.

166
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,669
Now, men, in conclusion...

167
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:06,798
...I would like to say
that in the two years...

168
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,677
...it has been my privilege
to be your commanding officer...

169
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:13,680
...I have always expected
the best from you...

170
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:17,643
...and you have never given me
anything less than that.

171
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,897
Today the nation is counting on us.

172
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,983
We are not going to let them down.

173
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,194
Good luck to you all.

174
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:00,394
Here's the attack profile, sir.

175
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,215
This is your attack profile.

176
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,552
"To ensure that the enemy cannot
monitor voice transmission...

177
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,762
...or plant false transmission...

178
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:40,934
...the CRM 114 is to be switched
into all receiver circuits.

179
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:44,479
The emergency base code prefix
is to be set...

180
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,940
...on the dials of the CRM.

181
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:51,611
This will block any transmission other
than those preceded by a code prefix.

182
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,323
Stand by to set code prefix.

183
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,826
Roger. Ready to set code prefix.

184
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,454
Set code prefix.

185
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,591
-Code prefix set.
-Lock code prefix.

186
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,636
Code prefix locked.

187
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:20,265
Switch all receiver circuits
to CRM discriminators.

188
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,644
All circuits switched
to CRM discriminators.

189
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,355
Check auto-destruct circuits.

190
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,860
Auto-destruct circuits checked.

191
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:41,620
Primary target:
the ICBM complex at Laputa.

192
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:48,043
Target reference:
Yankee-Golf-Tango, 360.

193
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:54,216
Thirty-megaton nuclear device
fused for airburst at 10,000 feet.

194
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:58,804
Twenty-megaton nuclear device
will be used if first malfunctions.

195
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,515
Otherwise, proceed
to secondary target:

196
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:05,644
Missile complex seven miles east
of Borchov.

197
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:09,689
Target reference:
November-Bravo-X-ray...

198
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,192
... 108.

199
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:17,656
Fused airburst at 10--
Check, 12,000 feet.

200
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:32,754
Excuse me, sir. Something rather
interesting has just cropped up.

201
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:35,757
Listen to that. Music.
Civilian broadcasting.

202
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:41,555
I think the Pentagon has given us
an exercise to test our readiness.

203
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,557
I think it's taking things too far.

204
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,893
Our fellows will be inside Russian
radar cover in 20 minutes.

205
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:50,564
Listen to that. Chock-a-block
full of stations, all churning it out.

206
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,567
-Mandrake?
-Yes, sir?

207
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,903
I thought I issued instructions
for all radios to be impounded.

208
00:19:57,071 --> 00:20:01,283
You did, and I was in the process of
impounding this when I switched it on.

209
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:05,078
I thought, our fellows hitting Russian
radar, dropping all their stuff...

210
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:09,583
...I'd better tell you. Because if
they do, it'll cause a bit of a stink.

211
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,712
Group captain,
the officer-exchange program...

212
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,424
...does not give you any special
prerogatives to question my orders.

213
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:21,720
I realize that, sir, but I thought you'd
be rather pleased to hear the news.

214
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,556
I mean, after all....
Well, let's face it.

215
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:28,643
We don't want to start a nuclear war
unless we really have to, do we?

216
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:33,231
Please sit down.
And turn that thing off.

217
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,441
Yes, sir.

218
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:35,984
What about the planes?

219
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:39,446
Surely we must issue
the recall code immediately.

220
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:42,324
Group captain, the planes
are not gonna be recalled.

221
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,994
My attack orders have been issued
and the orders stand.

222
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:51,499
If you'll excuse me saying so, sir,
that would be, to my way of thinking...

223
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,752
...rather an odd way
of looking at it.

224
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,171
If a Russian attack
was in progress...

225
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,175
...we would certainly not be hearing
civilian broadcasting.

226
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,136
-Are you certain of that?
-I'm absolutely positive.

227
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,513
And what if it is true?

228
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,142
I'm afraid I'm still not with you, sir,
because, I mean....

229
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,979
If a Russian attack
was not in progress...

230
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:18,318
...then your use of Plan R-- In fact,
your orders to the entire wing....

231
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:30,205
I would say that there was something
dreadfully wrong somewhere.

232
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,625
Why don't you take it easy,
group captain.

233
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,544
Please make me a drink
of grain alcohol and rainwater...

234
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,214
...and help yourself
to whatever you'd like.

235
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:52,018
General Ripper, sir, as an officer
in Her Majesty's Air Force...

236
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:55,355
...it is my clear duty
under the present circumstances...

237
00:21:55,523 --> 00:22:00,068
...to issue the recall code upon my
own authority and bring back the wing.

238
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,237
If you'll excuse me, sir.

239
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,498
Sir, I must ask you for the key
and the recall code.

240
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,709
Have you got them handy?

241
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,253
I told you to take it easy,
group captain.

242
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:20,880
There's nothing anybody can do
about this now.

243
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,383
I'm the only person who knows
the code group.

244
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:26,678
Then I must insist, sir,
that you give them to me!

245
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:39,190
Do I take it, sir, you are threatening
a brother officer with a gun?

246
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:45,530
Mandrake, I suppose
it never occurred to you...

247
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:49,200
...that while we're chatting here
so enjoyably...

248
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:53,121
...a decision is being made
by the president...

249
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:56,416
...and the joint chiefs in the war room
at the Pentagon.

250
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:03,048
And when they realize there is
no possibility of recalling the wing...

251
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,551
...there will be only one course
of action open:

252
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:09,429
Total commitment.

253
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:17,145
Mandrake, do you recall what
Clemenceau once said about war?

254
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:20,148
No, I don't think I do, sir. No.

255
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,819
He said war was too important
to be left to the generals.

256
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:26,404
When he said that, 50 years ago...

257
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,824
When he said that, 50 years ago...

258
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:32,494
...he might have been right.

259
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,954
But today...

260
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:38,458
...war is too important
to be left to politicians.

261
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:43,004
They have neither the time,
the training...

262
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:46,174
...nor the inclination
for strategic thought.

263
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:53,306
I can no longer sit back
and allow...

264
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:58,520
...Communist infiltration,
Communist indoctrination...

265
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,106
...Communist subversion...

266
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:05,527
...and the international
Communist conspiracy...

267
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,488
...to sap and impurify...

268
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:11,991
...all of our precious bodily fluids.

269
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,499
Staines, is everybody here?

270
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:22,293
Mr. President, the secretary of state
is in Vietnam.

271
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:26,214
The secretary of defense is in Laos,
the vice president is in Mexico City.

272
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:29,300
We can establish contact with them
at any time.

273
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,219
The undersecretaries are all here.

274
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:34,472
Right. Now, General Turgidson,
what's going on here?

275
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,518
Mr. President...

276
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:42,230
...about 35 minutes ago...

277
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:43,481
...General Jack Ripper,
the commanding general...

278
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,317
...General Jack Ripper,
the commanding general...

279
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,820
...of Burpelson Air Force Base...

280
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:52,157
...issued an order to the 34 B-52s
of his wing...

281
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,367
...which were airborne
at the time...

282
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:58,538
...as part of a special exercise we were
holding called Operation Dropkick.

283
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:03,376
Now, it appears that the order
called for the planes...

284
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:06,838
...to attack their targets
inside Russia.

285
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:11,092
The planes are fully armed
with nuclear weapons...

286
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,721
...with an average load
of 40 megatons each.

287
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:19,350
Now, the central display of Russia will
indicate the position of the planes.

288
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:23,938
The triangles
are their primary targets.

289
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:27,942
The squares
are their secondary targets.

290
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:33,406
The aircraft will begin penetrating
Russian radar cover within 25 minutes.

291
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:38,703
General Turgidson, I find this
very difficult to understand.

292
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,706
I was under the impression
I was the only one in authority...

293
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:44,250
...to order the use of
nuclear weapons.

294
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:49,422
That's right, sir. You are
the only person authorized to do so.

295
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:53,801
And although I hate to judge
before all the facts are in...

296
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:57,472
...it's beginning to look like
General Ripper exceeded his authority.

297
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:02,435
It certainly does. Far beyond the point
I would have imagined possible.

298
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:06,147
Well, perhaps you're forgetting
the provisions of Plan R, sir.

299
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:08,107
Plan R?

300
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:12,946
Plan R is an emergency war plan...

301
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,615
...in which a lower-echelon
commander may order...

302
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:18,826
...nuclear retaliation
after a sneak attack...

303
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:22,413
...if the normal chain of command
has been disrupted.

304
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,458
You approved it, sir.
You must remember.

305
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:30,129
Surely you must recall, sir,
when Senator Beaufort...

306
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:33,800
...made that big hassle about
our deterrent lacking credibility.

307
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:38,596
The idea was for Plan R to be
a sort of retaliatory safeguard.

308
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,640
A safeguard?

309
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:43,977
I admit the human element
seems to have failed us here.

310
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:47,438
But the idea was to discourage
the Russkies from any hope...

311
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,024
...they could knock out Washington,
and yourself...

312
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,151
...as part of a sneak attack...

313
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,612
...and escape retaliation because of
lack of proper command and control.

314
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,364
...and escape retaliation because of
lack of proper command and control.

315
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:59,158
I assume the planes will return
automatically...

316
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:02,036
...once they reach their
fail-safe points.

317
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:06,874
No, sir, I'm afraid not. The planes
were holding at their fail-safe points...

318
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,668
...when the go code was issued.

319
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:13,006
Once they fly beyond fail-safe, they do
not require a second order to proceed.

320
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,550
They will continue
until they reach their target.

321
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,846
Then why haven't you radioed the
planes, countermanding the go code?

322
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:23,391
I'm afraid we're unable to
communicate with any of the aircraft.

323
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,143
Why?

324
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:28,187
As you may recall, sir...

325
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:31,858
...one of the provisions
of Plan R provides...

326
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:36,529
...that once the go code
is received...

327
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:39,907
...the normal SSB radios
in the aircraft...

328
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,493
...are switched into
a special coded device...

329
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,413
...which I believe is designated
as CRM 114.

330
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,582
Now, in order
to prevent the enemy...

331
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,084
...from issuing fake
or confusing orders...

332
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:54,088
...CRM 114 is designed
not to receive at all...

333
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:56,507
...unless the message is preceded...

334
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:59,719
...by the correct three-letter
code group prefix.

335
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:05,099
Do you mean to tell me, general, you
will be unable to recall the aircraft?

336
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:08,186
That's the size of it.
However, we are plowing through...

337
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:11,105
...every possible three-letter
combination of the code.

338
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:16,402
But since there are
17,000 permutations...

339
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:20,073
...it's going to take us about two days
to transmit them all.

340
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,909
How soon will planes penetrate
Russian radar cover?

341
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:26,454
-Eighteen minutes from now.
-Are you in contact with Ripper?

342
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:31,417
No, sir. General Ripper sealed off
the base and cut off communications.

343
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:34,754
-Where did you get this information?
-General Ripper called...

344
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:39,425
...Strategic Air Command headquarters
shortly after he issued the go code.

345
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:42,970
I have a portion of the transcript,
if you'd like me to read it.

346
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,056
Read it.

347
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,394
The duty officer asked
General Ripper...

348
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:53,606
...to confirm the fact that he had
issued the go code and he said:

349
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:58,152
"Yes, gentlemen, they are on their way
in and no one can bring them back.

350
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,072
For the sake of our country
and our way of life...

351
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,783
...I suggest you get the rest of SAC
in after them.

352
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:08,788
Otherwise, we will be totally destroyed
by Red retaliation.

353
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:14,168
My boys will give you the best kind
of start: 1400 megatons' worth.

354
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:17,797
And you sure as hell
won't stop them now.

355
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:20,758
So let's get going.
There's no other choice.

356
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:25,680
God willing, we will prevail
in peace and freedom from fear...

357
00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:29,142
...and in true health
through the purity...

358
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:33,104
...and essence of our natural...

359
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,647
...fluids.

360
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:37,650
God bless you all."

361
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,362
Then he hung up.

362
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:45,825
We're still trying to figure out
the meaning of that last phrase.

363
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:50,204
There's nothing to figure out.
This man is obviously a psychotic.

364
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:55,376
I'd like to hold off judgment on a thing
like that, sir, until all the facts are in.

365
00:29:55,544 --> 00:30:00,047
General Turgidson, when you
instituted the human reliability tests...

366
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,550
...you assured me there was
no possibility...

367
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:05,052
...of such a thing ever occurring.

368
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:10,141
Well, I don't think it's quite fair
to condemn the whole program...

369
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:10,808
...because of a single slip-up, sir.

370
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,852
...because of a single slip-up, sir.

371
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,480
I wanna speak to General Ripper
on the telephone.

372
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,064
I'm afraid that's impossible.

373
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:21,027
General Turgidson, I am becoming
less and less interested...

374
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:24,739
...in your estimates
of what is possible and impossible.

375
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:28,242
-General Faceman.
-Yes, sir?

376
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,912
Are there any Army units
stationed near Burpelson?

377
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,164
I'll just check, sir.

378
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:39,420
Hello?

379
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:44,217
I told you never to call me here.
Don't you know where I am?

380
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,222
Look, baby, I can't talk to you now.

381
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,891
My president needs me.

382
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:55,603
Of course Bucky would rather
be there with you.

383
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,774
Of course it isn't only physical.

384
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,360
I deeply respect you
as a human being.

385
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:05,571
Someday I'm gonna make you
Mrs. Buck Turgidson.

386
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,617
Oh, listen, you go back to sleep.

387
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:12,620
Bucky will be back there
just as soon as he can.

388
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:17,416
All right. Listen, sug,
don't forget to say your prayers.

389
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:28,261
Apparently,
the 23rd Airborne Division...

390
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:31,138
...is stationed seven miles away
at Alvarado.

391
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:35,476
General Faceman, I want them to enter
the base, locate General Ripper...

392
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,937
...and put him
in immediate contact with me.

393
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:39,647
Yes, sir.

394
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,817
Mr. President, if I may advise.

395
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:47,405
Under a condition red, it is standard
procedure the base be sealed off...

396
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:50,241
...and the base defended
by base security troops.

397
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:54,745
Any force trying to enter there would
certainly encounter heavy casualties.

398
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:58,666
General Turgidson, with all due
respect for your defense team...

399
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,752
...my boys can brush them aside
without too much trouble.

400
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:07,466
Mr. President, there are one or two
points I'd like to make, if I may?

401
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:09,927
Go ahead, general.

402
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:16,017
One: our hopes for recalling
the 843rd bomb wing...

403
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:20,354
...are quickly being reduced
to a very low order of probability.

404
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:23,316
Two: in less than 15 minutes
from now...

405
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,527
...the Russkies will be making
radar contact with the planes.

406
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,654
Three: when they do...

407
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:32,658
...they will go absolutely ape and
strike back with everything they've got.

408
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:36,329
Four: if, prior to this time...

409
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:39,957
...we have done nothing to suppress
their retaliatory capabilities...

410
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,668
...we will suffer virtual annihilation.

411
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,712
Now...

412
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,716
...five:

413
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:51,385
If, on the other hand...

414
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:58,142
...we immediately launched an attack
on their airfields and missile bases...

415
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,687
...we'd stand a good chance of
catching them with their pants down.

416
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:04,023
We've got a 5-to-1
missile superiority.

417
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:07,068
We could easily assign three missiles
to every target...

418
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,863
...and still have an effective reserve
force for any other contingency.

419
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:15,993
Six: an unofficial study which
we undertook of this eventuality...

420
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:20,998
...indicated that we would destroy
90 percent of their nuclear capabilities.

421
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,209
We would therefore prevail...

422
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:27,880
...and suffer only modest civilian
casualties from their remaining force...

423
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:30,925
...which would be badly damaged
and uncoordinated.

424
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:34,261
General, it is the avowed policy
of our country...

425
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,012
...never to strike first
with nuclear weapons.

426
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,722
...never to strike first
with nuclear weapons.

427
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:41,519
Well, Mr. President, I'd say Ripper
has already invalidated that policy.

428
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:46,065
That was not an act of national policy.
There are still alternatives open to us.

429
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,776
Mr. President...

430
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,071
...we are rapidly approaching
a moment of truth...

431
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:55,074
...both for ourselves
and for the life of our nation.

432
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,785
Now, truth is not always
a pleasant thing.

433
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:00,413
But it is necessary now
to make a choice.

434
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,249
To choose between two
admittedly regrettable...

435
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:06,794
...but nevertheless distinguishable,
postwar environments.

436
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,963
One where 20 million people
are killed.

437
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:11,632
The other, 150 million people killed.

438
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,719
You're talking about mass murder,
general, not war.

439
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,389
Mr. President, I'm not saying
we wouldn't get our hair mussed.

440
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:23,102
But I do say no more than
10 to 20 million killed, tops.

441
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,146
Depending on the breaks.

442
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:29,233
I will not go down in history as the
greatest mass murderer since Hitler.

443
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:30,067
It might be better
if you were more concerned...

444
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,777
It might be better
if you were more concerned...

445
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:35,281
...with the American people than
with your image in history books.

446
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:38,409
General Turgidson, I've heard
quite sufficient from you.

447
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,327
Thank you very much.

448
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:43,497
Mr. President, they have
the ambassador upstairs.

449
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:47,168
-Oh, good. Any difficulty?
-He's having a fit about the MPs.

450
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,754
That can't be helped.
Have him brought here.

451
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,338
Yes, sir.

452
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,966
Is that the Russian ambassador?

453
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:56,218
Yes, it is, general.

454
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:01,140
Am I to understand
the Russian ambassador...

455
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:03,642
...is to be admitted entrance
to the war room?

456
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,645
That is correct.
He is here on my orders.

457
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,776
I don't know exactly how
to put this, sir...

458
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,196
...but are you aware of what
a breach of security that would be?

459
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:19,492
I mean, he'll see everything.
He'll see the big board.

460
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:25,039
That is precisely the idea, general.
That is precisely the idea.

461
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:30,503
Staines, get Premier Kissoff
on the hot line.

462
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:41,138
Survival kit contents check.

463
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:41,514
Survival kit contents check.

464
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:46,393
In them, you will find
one .45-caliber automatic...

465
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,021
...two boxes of ammunition...

466
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:52,483
...four days' concentrated
emergency rations...

467
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:55,820
...one drug issue
containing antibiotics...

468
00:35:55,987 --> 00:36:00,282
...morphine, vitamin pills,
pep pills...

469
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,161
...sleeping pills,
tranquilizer pills...

470
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:09,041
One miniature combination
Russian phrase book and Bible...

471
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:12,044
...$100 in rubles...

472
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:14,380
...$100 in gold...

473
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,757
...nine packs of chewing gum...

474
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:19,218
...one issue of prophylactics...

475
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:23,097
...three lipsticks,
three pair of nylon stockings.

476
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:28,102
Shoot, a fella could have a pretty
good weekend in Vegas with that stuff.

477
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:36,360
-You don't have any fresh fish?
-I'm afraid not, sir.

478
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,612
-Your eggs are fresh?
-Oh, yes, sir.

479
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,155
I will have poached eggs.

480
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,616
And bring me some cigars, please.
Havana cigars.

481
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:46,120
And that will be all for you, sir?
I'll see to it right away.

482
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:49,415
Try one of these Jamaican cigars,
ambassador. They're good.

483
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:52,918
Thank you, no. I do not support
the work of imperialist stooges.

484
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:55,588
Oh, only Commie stooges, huh?

485
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:57,965
Mr. President.

486
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:02,761
You're gonna let that lousy Commie
punk vomit all over us like this?

487
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,138
Mr. President?

488
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,600
They haven't reached Premier Kissoff.
They don't know where he is...

489
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,769
...and he won't be back
for another two hours.

490
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,314
-Try B86543 Moscow.
-Yes, sir.

491
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,774
You'd never have found him
through his office.

492
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:19,737
Our premier is a man of the people,
but he is also a man, if you follow.

493
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:22,489
-Degenerate, atheistic Commie.
-What did you say?

494
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:26,118
I said, Premier Kissoff is
a degenerate, atheistic Commie!

495
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:29,121
-Have this ignorant fool--
-I'm sorry!

496
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:33,167
Mr. President,
I think they're trying the number.

497
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:45,262
Gentlemen, you can't fight in here.
This is the war room!

498
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,931
Gentlemen, you can't fight in here.
This is the war room!

499
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,808
What is going on here?
I demand an explanation.

500
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:54,146
This clumsy fool tried to plant
that ridiculous camera on me.

501
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:56,815
You bet your sweets, Mr. Commie!
Look at this.

502
00:37:56,983 --> 00:38:01,403
This lousy Commie rat was taking
pictures with this, of the big board!

503
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:03,447
Mr. Ambassador!

504
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:07,993
This clumsy fool attempted to plant
that ridiculous camera on me.

505
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:10,871
That's a damn lie!
I saw him with my own eyes.

506
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:15,167
This is outrageous. I have never heard
of such behavior in the war room.

507
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:18,671
Mr. President, I think
they're getting him on the line.

508
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,700
You gotta hand it to
those Commies.

509
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,368
Yeah.

510
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:52,246
Those trucks sure look like
the real thing, don't they?

511
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,248
I wonder
where they got them from.

512
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:57,710
Probably bought them
from the Army as war surplus.

513
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:04,466
Okay, open up at 200 yards.

514
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:05,319
Tell him where you are and that
you'll speak if I say anything untrue...

515
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:08,655
...but please don't tell him
anything more than that.

516
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:13,494
Alexi? Alexi, please. I beg you.

517
00:40:13,787 --> 00:40:14,411
But I don't have a phone.

518
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,330
But I don't have a phone.

519
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:18,540
Give him your phone, Frank.

520
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:50,197
I've done as you asked.
Be careful. I think he is drunk.

521
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:57,621
Hello? Hello, Dimitri?

522
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,498
Listen, I can't hear too well.

523
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:03,377
Do you suppose you could
turn the music down just a little?

524
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,379
Oh, that's much better.

525
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:08,298
Yeah. Yes.

526
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:12,302
Fine. I can hear you now, Dimitri.

527
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,848
Clear and plain
and coming through fine.

528
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:20,352
I'm coming through fine too?
Good. Then....

529
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:24,356
Well, then, as you say,
we're both coming through fine. Good.

530
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:28,694
Well, it's good that you're fine
and I'm fine.

531
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:32,072
I agree with you.
It's great to be fine.

532
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:35,075
Now then, Dimitri...

533
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:40,873
...you know how we've always talked
about the possibility...

534
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,709
...of something going wrong
with the bomb.

535
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:47,045
The bomb, Dimitri.

536
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:50,841
The hydrogen bomb.

537
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,886
Well, now, what happened is...

538
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:58,182
...one of our base commanders,
he had a sort of--

539
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,435
Well, he went a little funny
in the head.

540
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,521
You know, just a little funny.

541
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:04,605
You know, just a little funny.

542
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:09,276
And he went and did a silly thing.

543
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:13,780
Well, I'll tell you what he did.
He ordered his planes...

544
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,910
...to attack your country.

545
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,412
Well, let me finish, Dimitri.

546
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:23,290
Let me finish, Dimitri.

547
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:26,585
Well, listen, how do you think
I feel about it?

548
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:29,588
Can you imagine how I feel
about it, Dimitri?

549
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:35,427
Why do you think I'm calling you?
Just to say hello?

550
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:38,805
Of course I like to speak to you!

551
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,433
Of course I like to say hello!

552
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:43,644
Not now, but any time, Dimitri.

553
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:47,773
I'm just calling up to tell you
something terrible has happened.

554
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:50,817
Of course it's a friendly call.

555
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:55,280
Listen, if it wasn't friendly, you
probably wouldn't have even got it.

556
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:02,287
They will not reach their targets
for at least another hour.

557
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:05,457
I am-- I am positive, Dimitri.

558
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,960
I've been all over this
with your ambassador.

559
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,504
It is not a trick.

560
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:12,005
Well, I'll tell you.

561
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:15,968
We'd like to give your air staff
a complete rundown on the targets...

562
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:19,304
...the flight plans and the
defensive systems of the planes.

563
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:24,309
Yes, I mean, if we're unable
to recall the planes...

564
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:27,104
...then I'd say that, well...

565
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:32,818
...we're just gonna have to help you
destroy them, Dimitri.

566
00:43:32,986 --> 00:43:35,821
I know they're our boys.

567
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:38,490
All right, listen.
Now, who should we call?

568
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:45,455
Who should we call, Dimitri?
Sorry, you faded away there.

569
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:49,835
The People's Central
Air Defense Headquarters.

570
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:52,170
Where is that, Dimitri?

571
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,464
In Omsk. Right.

572
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:56,717
Yes.

573
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:59,761
Oh, you'll call them first, will you?

574
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:04,182
Do you happen to have
the phone number on you, Dimitri?

575
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:09,062
What? I see.
Just ask for Omsk information.

576
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:15,193
I'm sorry too, Dimitri.
I'm very sorry.

577
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:19,197
All right, you're sorrier than I am.
But I am sorry as well.

578
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,702
I am as sorry as you are, Dimitri.

579
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,704
Don't say that you're more sorry...

580
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:28,749
...because I'm capable of being
just as sorry as you are.

581
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:32,294
So we're both sorry, all right?
All right.

582
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:37,799
Yes, he's right here. Yes, he wants
to talk to you. Just a second.

583
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:52,564
What?

584
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:13,543
What? What is it? What?

585
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,713
The fools. The mad fools.

586
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:19,883
What's happened?

587
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:22,594
The doomsday machine.

588
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:25,263
The doom--? The doomsday machine?
What is that?

589
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:26,723
A device which will destroy
all human and animal life on Earth.

590
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:30,727
A device which will destroy
all human and animal life on Earth.

591
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:33,105
All human and animal life?

592
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:50,288
-Mandrake?
-Yes, Jack?

593
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:54,918
Have you ever seen a Commie
drink a glass of water?

594
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:59,631
Well, no, I can't say I have, Jack.

595
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,637
Vodka. That's what they drink,
isn't it? Never water.

596
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:10,100
Well, I believe that's
what they drink, Jack, yes.

597
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:13,645
On no account will a Commie
ever drink water...

598
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:16,106
...and not without good reason.

599
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,776
Oh, yes.

600
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:25,949
I can't quite see
what you're getting at, Jack.

601
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:29,828
Water.
That's what I'm getting at, water.

602
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,789
Mandrake, water is the source
of all life.

603
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,332
Mandrake, water is the source
of all life.

604
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:39,379
Seven-tenths of this Earth's surface
is water.

605
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:41,923
Why, do you realize that...

606
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:45,886
...70 percent of you is water?

607
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,387
Good Lord.

608
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:52,642
And as human beings,
you and I need fresh, pure water...

609
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,313
...to replenish
our precious bodily fluids.

610
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:59,191
-You beginning to understand?
-Yes.

611
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,529
Mandrake....

612
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:11,703
Mandrake, have you never wondered
why I drink only distilled water...

613
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:16,208
...or rainwater,
and only pure grain alcohol?

614
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:19,586
Well, it did occur to me, Jack, yes.

615
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:25,425
Have you ever heard of a thing called
fluoridation? Fluoridation of water?

616
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,554
Yes, I have heard of that, Jack, yes.
Yes.

617
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:31,556
Well, do you know what it is?

618
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:34,726
No. No, I don't know what it is, no.

619
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:38,730
Do you realize that fluoridation...

620
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:41,608
...is the most
monstrously conceived...

621
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:45,237
...and dangerous Communist plot
we have ever had to face?

622
00:47:51,244 --> 00:47:53,787
Two can play at that game, soldier.

623
00:47:58,084 --> 00:48:00,794
That's nice shooting, soldier!

624
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:27,279
Mandrake, come here.

625
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,322
You calling me, Jack?

626
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:31,950
Come over here
and help me with this belt.

627
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:37,914
I haven't had
very much experience...

628
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:40,792
...you know,
with those sort of machines, Jack...

629
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,462
...I've only ever pressed a button
in my old Spitfire.

630
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:48,508
In the name of Her Majesty and the
Continental Congress, feed the belt.

631
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:53,179
Jack, I'd love to come,
but what's happened, you see...

632
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:56,141
...the string in my leg's gone.

633
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,769
-The what?
-The string. I never told you...

634
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:05,108
...but, you see, I've got a gammy leg.
Oh, dear. Gone. Shot off.

635
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:10,780
Mandrake, come over here.
The redcoats are coming. Come on!

636
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:15,994
When it is detonated, it will produce
enough radioactive fallout...

637
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:17,996
...so that in 10 months...

638
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:21,166
...the surface of the Earth
will be as dead as the moon.

639
00:49:21,334 --> 00:49:24,044
Come on, de Sadesky!
That's ridiculous!

640
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:26,212
Our studies show
even the worst fallout...

641
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,465
...is down to a safe level
after two weeks.

642
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:32,302
You've obviously never heard
of cobalt thorium G.

643
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:33,720
No, what about it?

644
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:37,682
Cobalt thorium G has
a radioactive half-life of 93 years.

645
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:40,852
If you take, say, 50 H bombs
in the 100 megaton range...

646
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,313
...and jacket them
with cobalt thorium G...

647
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:48,026
...when they are exploded, they will
produce a doomsday shroud...

648
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:50,362
...a lethal cloud of radioactivity...

649
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:54,866
...which will encircle the Earth
for 93 years!

650
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:58,578
What a load of Commie bull.
I mean, after all....

651
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:02,040
I'm afraid I don't understand
something, Alexi.

652
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:06,044
Is the premier threatening to
explode it if we carry out the attack?

653
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:08,421
No. It is not a thing
a sane man would do.

654
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:11,883
The doomsday machine is designed
to trigger itself automatically.

655
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:13,927
But surely you can
disarm it somehow.

656
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:17,931
No. It is designed to explode if
any attempt is made to un-trigger it.

657
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:19,265
Automatically?

658
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,935
It's a Commie trick!
We're wasting valuable time!

659
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:25,271
Look at the big board!
They're getting ready to clobber us!

660
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:29,859
But this is absolute madness.
Why should you build such a thing?

661
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,611
Some of us fought against it.

662
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:35,365
But we could not keep up with the
expense involved in the arms race...

663
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:38,618
...the space race
and the peace race.

664
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:40,036
At the same time,
our people grumbled...

665
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,246
At the same time,
our people grumbled...

666
00:50:41,414 --> 00:50:43,915
...for more nylons
and washing machines.

667
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:46,584
Our doomsday scheme cost us
a small fraction...

668
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:49,796
...of what we had been spending
on defense in a single year.

669
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:52,757
The deciding factor was
when we learned your country...

670
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:56,386
...was working along similar lines.
We were afraid of a doomsday gap.

671
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:59,806
This is preposterous! I've never
approved of anything like that.

672
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:02,726
Our source was
The New York Times.

673
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:06,980
Dr. Strangelove, do we have anything
like that in the works?

674
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:09,983
A moment, please, Mr. President.

675
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:15,780
Under the authority granted me...

676
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:19,826
...as director of weapons research
and development...

677
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:24,289
...I commissioned last year
a study of this project...

678
00:51:24,457 --> 00:51:26,082
...by the Bland Corporation.

679
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:26,583
...by the Bland Corporation.

680
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:29,502
Based on the findings
of the report...

681
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:35,175
...my conclusion was that this idea
was not a practical deterrent...

682
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:39,304
...for reasons which at this moment
must be all too obvious.

683
00:51:39,472 --> 00:51:42,807
Then you mean it is possible
for them to have built such a thing?

684
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:51,816
Mr. President, the technology required
is easily within the means...

685
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:56,279
...of even the smallest
nuclear power.

686
00:51:56,447 --> 00:52:01,159
It requires only the will to do so.

687
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:04,871
But how is it possible for this thing
to be triggered automatically...

688
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:07,499
...and at the same time
impossible to un-trigger?

689
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:11,669
Mr. President,
it is not only possible...

690
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,671
...it is essential.

691
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:18,176
That is the whole idea
of this machine, you know.

692
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:23,473
Deterrence is the art of producing
in the mind of the enemy...

693
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:26,142
...the fear to attack.

694
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:31,147
And so because of the automated and
irrevocable decision-making process...

695
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:33,149
...which rules out
human meddling...

696
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,068
...which rules out
human meddling...

697
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:39,155
...the doomsday machine
is terrifying.

698
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:41,324
This is simple to understand.

699
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:44,577
And completely credible
and convincing.

700
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:47,747
Gee, I wish we had one of them
doomsday machines, Stainesy.

701
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:52,168
But this is fantastic, Strangelove.
How can it be triggered automatically?

702
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:56,047
Well, it's remarkably simple
to do that.

703
00:52:56,215 --> 00:52:59,592
When you merely wish
to bury bombs...

704
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:02,053
...there's no limit to the size.

705
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:08,268
After that, they are connected
to a gigantic complex of computers.

706
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:14,232
Now, then: a specific and
clearly-defined set of circumstances...

707
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,777
...under which the bombs
are to be exploded...

708
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:21,906
...is programmed into
a tape memory bank.

709
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:25,869
-A single role of tape can store....
-Strangelove.

710
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:29,205
What kind of a name is that?
That ain't no Kraut name, is it?

711
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:31,583
He changed it
when he became a citizen.

712
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:34,294
It used to be Merkwürdigliebe.

713
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:39,132
Well, a Kraut by any other name,
huh, Stainesy?

714
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:45,305
--is that the whole point of
the doomsday machine...

715
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:48,975
...is lost if you keep it a secret.

716
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:51,227
Why didn't you tell the world?

717
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:55,648
It was to be announced
at the Party Congress on Monday.

718
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:59,110
As you know,
the premier loves surprises.

719
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,869
Stay with me, Mandrake.

720
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:57,710
All right, Mandrake, now feed me.
Feed me bullets.

721
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:32,578
Jack, don't you think we'd be better off
away from all this flying glass?

722
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,831
No, we're okay here.

723
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:40,086
Mandrake, do you realize that in
addition to fluoridating water, why...

724
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:43,715
...there are studies underway
to fluoridate salt, flour...

725
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:48,845
...fruit juices, soup, sugar,
milk, ice cream?

726
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:50,430
Ice cream, Mandrake.

727
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,932
-Children's ice cream.
-Good Lord.

728
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,226
You know when fluoridation
first began?

729
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,271
No, I don't, Jack.

730
00:55:58,439 --> 00:56:00,732
1946.

731
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,358
1946, Mandrake.

732
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,568
1946, Mandrake.

733
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:07,905
How does that coincide with your
postwar Commie conspiracy, huh?

734
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:11,284
It's incredibly obvious, isn't it?

735
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:16,914
A foreign substance is introduced
into our precious bodily fluids...

736
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:20,251
...without the knowledge
of the individual.

737
00:56:20,419 --> 00:56:23,046
Certainly without any choice.

738
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:27,425
That's the way
a hard-core Commie works.

739
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:31,971
Jack. Listen, tell me--
Tell me, Jack.

740
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:37,643
When did you first become--
Well, develop this theory?

741
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:40,938
Well, I....

742
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:44,567
I first became aware of it,
Mandrake...

743
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:47,487
...during the physical act of love.

744
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:52,658
Yes, a profound sense of fatigue...

745
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,286
...a feeling of emptiness followed.

746
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:59,957
Luckily, I was able to interpret
these feelings correctly.

747
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:02,251
Loss of essence.

748
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:07,507
I can assure you it has not recurred,
Mandrake.

749
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:11,761
Women sense my power...

750
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:14,597
...and they seek the life essence.

751
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:18,518
-I do not avoid women, Mandrake.
-No.

752
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:21,479
But I do deny them my essence.

753
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:24,482
Yes, yes, Jack.

754
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:39,288
Cease fire!

755
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:02,186
My boys must have surrendered.

756
00:58:02,354 --> 00:58:04,564
Well, there it is.

757
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,524
Now, Jack, listen.

758
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:09,986
While there's still time, I beg you,
let's recall the wing and--

759
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:15,366
Those boys were like my children,
Mandrake.

760
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:20,246
-Now they let me down.
-No, no, Jack, not a bit of it.

761
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:23,166
No, I'm sure they all gave it
their very best.

762
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,751
I'm equally sure they all died
thinking of you...

763
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,546
...every man jack of them, Jack.

764
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:31,215
Supposing a bit of water
has gone off, eh?

765
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:33,718
One can never be too sure
about those things.

766
00:58:33,886 --> 00:58:36,679
But you look at me.
Do I look all rancid and clotted?

767
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:39,557
You look at me, Jack. Look.

768
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:43,728
And I drink a lot of water, you know.
I'm what you might call a water man.

769
00:58:43,896 --> 00:58:47,106
And I can swear to you,
my boy, swear to you...

770
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:52,069
...that there's nothing wrong with
my bodily fluids. Not a thing, Jackie.

771
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,405
Mandrake, were you ever
a prisoner of war?

772
00:58:54,573 --> 00:58:58,117
Well, Jack,
the time's running very--

773
00:58:58,285 --> 00:59:01,287
-What?
-Were you ever a prisoner of war?

774
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:03,456
Yes, I was,
as a matter of fact, Jack.

775
00:59:03,624 --> 00:59:06,626
Did they torture you?

776
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:10,213
Yes, they did. I was tortured
by the Japanese, if you must know.

777
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,132
-Not a pretty story.
-What happened?

778
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:17,470
I don't know, Jack. It's difficult
to think of under these conditions.

779
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,805
Well, what happened was...

780
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:23,267
...they got me on the old
Rangoon-Inchinawa Railway.

781
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:27,730
I was laying train lines
for the bloody Japanese puff-puffs.

782
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:31,108
No, I mean, when they tortured you,
did you talk?

783
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,779
No, I....

784
00:59:34,947 --> 00:59:39,116
Well, I don't think they wanted me
to talk, really, or say anything.

785
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:42,286
It was their way of having
a bit of fun, the swines.

786
00:59:42,454 --> 00:59:45,957
The strange thing is they make
such bloody good cameras.

787
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:49,961
Those clowns outside
are gonna give me...

788
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:53,464
...a pretty good going-over
in a few minutes for the code.

789
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:55,091
Yes--

790
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:59,845
Yes, well, you may have....
May have quite a point there, Jack.

791
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:03,683
I don't know how well
I could stand up under torture.

792
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:07,019
Well, of course, the answer to that is,
boy, no one ever does.

793
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:11,274
And my advice to you, Jack,
is to give me the code now.

794
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:14,193
And if those devils come back
and try any rough stuff...

795
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:17,822
...we'll fight them together,
like we did just now on the floor.

796
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:21,158
You with your gun and me with a belt
and the ammo, feeding you.

797
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:24,287
"Feed me," you said,
and I was feeding you, Jack.

798
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,789
You know, Mandrake...

799
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:30,167
...I happen to believe in a life
after this one...

800
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:35,047
...and I know I'll have to answer
for what I've done.

801
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,342
And I think I can.

802
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:41,846
Yes, well, of course you can, Jack.
Of course you can. You can.

803
01:00:42,014 --> 01:00:44,181
I'm a religious man myself,
you know, Jack.

804
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:48,060
I believe in all that sort of thing
and I'm hoping, you know, Jack....

805
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:51,022
You've dropped your gun, Jack.
Yes.... You know what...?

806
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:54,692
No, Jack, let me take that for you.
I'll take that for you, Jack.

807
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:59,030
You know what I'm hoping? I'm hoping
you're going to give me the code.

808
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:02,658
And-- You're going to have a wash
and brush up? What a good idea.

809
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:05,328
Always did wonders for a man,
a wash and brush up.

810
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:08,247
Water on the back of the neck
makes you feel marvelous.

811
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:11,042
That's what we need,
water on the neck and the code.

812
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:14,670
Now, supposing I play a little
guessing game with you, Jack, boy.

813
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:17,548
I'll try and guess
what the code is--

814
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:38,944
Copilot to navigator.
I'm ready with the fuel figures now.

815
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:42,031
We have 109,000 total...

816
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:44,909
...79,000 in the mains...

817
01:01:45,077 --> 01:01:47,787
...and 30,000 in the auxiliaries.

818
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:49,789
And that works out
to roughly...

819
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:53,334
...seven hours, 15 minutes
endurance from this time.

820
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:59,131
DSO to captain. I have
an unidentified radar blip.

821
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,135
Distance, 60 miles.

822
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:07,431
Approximate speed, Mach 3.

823
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,975
Looks like a missile tracking us.

824
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:16,607
Confirmed, definite missile track.
Commence evasive action right.

825
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:25,783
Missile still closing range.

826
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:30,496
Distance, 50 miles.
Continue evasive action.

827
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:32,790
Lock ECM to target intercept mode.

828
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:37,002
ECM locked to
target intercept mode.

829
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,505
Missile still tracking
and closing distance.

830
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:43,676
Range, 40 miles.
Continue evasive action.

831
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:50,808
Electronic Guidance Scrambler
to blue grid.

832
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:54,353
Missile still tracking steady
and closing distance.

833
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:56,439
Range, 30 miles.

834
01:02:58,692 --> 01:03:02,945
Missile still closing true and steady.
Continue evasive action.

835
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:12,371
Range, 20 miles.

836
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:16,333
Missile still closing distance
and tracking steady.

837
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:18,836
Attack range gate
on maximum scan.

838
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:21,338
Range gate on maximum scan.

839
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:24,300
Range, 10 miles.

840
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:28,345
Missile track deflecting.
Continue evasive action.

841
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:31,682
Deflection increasing.
Range, eight miles.

842
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:35,686
Deflection still increasing.
Range, six miles.

843
01:03:35,854 --> 01:03:38,522
Missile still deflecting.
Range, four miles.

844
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:47,406
Range, two miles.
Missile still deflecting.

845
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:49,867
Range, one mile.
Missile detonated!

846
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:58,584
-Start lever to cutoff!
-Cutoff!

847
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,464
Essential power!

848
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:14,183
Re-select essential power!

849
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:16,352
Essential power re-selected.

850
01:04:23,485 --> 01:04:24,902
The hatch is stuck!

851
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:30,407
-Hit emergency power!
-Roger!

852
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:35,246
-Extinguishers!
-Roger!

853
01:04:41,962 --> 01:04:45,130
-Transfer switches!
-Transferred!

854
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:47,591
-Boost pumps off!
-Cut off!

855
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:01,313
Fuel valves three, four and six!

856
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:16,412
-Give me full power!
-Roger.

857
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:32,303
"Peace on Earth. Peace on Earth."

858
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:38,017
P-O-E.

859
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:40,978
"Purity of Essence."

860
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:44,648
O-P-O-E.

861
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:45,858
O-P-E.

862
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:57,328
Put your hands over your head.

863
01:05:57,495 --> 01:06:00,706
What the devil do you think
you're doing? Who are you?

864
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:02,666
Put your hands over your head.

865
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:06,337
What kind of suit
do you call that, fella?

866
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:08,380
What do you mean, suit?

867
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:10,883
This happens to be
an RAF uniform, sir.

868
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:13,218
And I am Group Captain
Lionel Mandrake...

869
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:15,346
...General Ripper's
executive officer.

870
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:16,889
Where's General Ripper?

871
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:19,850
He's dead, in the bathroom.

872
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:23,646
-Where's the bathroom?
-Next to you.

873
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:35,532
I don't know what stupid game
you're playing...

874
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:38,077
...but I've got an idea
what the recall code is.

875
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:40,537
I have to get in touch
with SAC headquarters.

876
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:44,375
I said, put your hands over your head
and keep them there. Go on.

877
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,085
-Got any witnesses?
-Witnesses?

878
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:48,504
What are you talking about?
He shot himself!

879
01:06:48,672 --> 01:06:50,756
While he was shaving, huh?

880
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:56,011
Now, look, Colonel "Bat" Guano,
if that really is your name...

881
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:59,932
...may I tell you that I have
a very, very good idea...

882
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:03,060
...I think, I hope, I pray,
what the recall code is.

883
01:07:03,228 --> 01:07:04,937
It's some theme he kept repeating.

884
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:09,108
A variation on "Peace on Earth"
or "Purity of Essence," one of those.

885
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:13,070
Put your hands up on top of
your head. Start walking.

886
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:16,365
Don't you know that General Ripper
went mad...

887
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:19,785
...and sent the whole wing
to attack the Soviets?

888
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:23,414
-What are you talking about?
-I'll tell you what I'm talking about.

889
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:27,584
I'm gonna pick up this red telephone,
which is connected to SAC...

890
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:29,628
...and I hope--

891
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:32,798
Blast. Blast.

892
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:37,678
Shot away, I expect, by one of your
men during this ridiculous fighting!

893
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:40,305
Right.

894
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:43,809
All right, Charlie, I've been
wasting too much time on you.

895
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:47,688
I got a lot of wounded men outside.
Start walking.

896
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:13,672
All the radio gear is out,
including the CRM 114.

897
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:17,009
I think the auto-destruct mechanism
got hit and blew itself up.

898
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:24,808
The fire is out.
The emergency power is on.

899
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:28,353
Everything seems to
check out all right. Will advise.

900
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:30,147
Roger. Navigator?

901
01:08:30,315 --> 01:08:35,486
I've worked out our rate of fuel loss
at approximately 162 per minute.

902
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:38,530
This gives us a radius of action
sufficient to take out...

903
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:41,992
...primary and secondary targets,
but we will not...

904
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:46,830
...repeat, not be able to make it back
to any base or neutral country.

905
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:48,123
However, we would have enough fuel
to ditch at weather ship Tango Delta...

906
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:52,544
However, we would have enough fuel
to ditch at weather ship Tango Delta...

907
01:08:52,712 --> 01:08:55,964
...grid coordinates 003 691.

908
01:09:00,762 --> 01:09:03,055
Well, boys,
we got three engines out...

909
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:06,725
...we got more holes in us
than a horse trader's mule...

910
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:09,144
...the radio is gone
and we're leaking fuel.

911
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:12,564
If we was flying any lower,
we'd need sleigh bells on this thing.

912
01:09:12,774 --> 01:09:15,651
But we got one little budge
on them Russkies.

913
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:17,736
At this height,
they might harpoon us...

914
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:20,823
...but they sure ain't gonna spot us
on no radar screen.

915
01:09:32,043 --> 01:09:33,919
The other way.

916
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:36,421
-Where are you taking me?
-To the main gate.

917
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:38,257
Colonel!

918
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:41,927
Colonel, I must know what you think
has been going on here.

919
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:43,929
-You wanna know what I think?
-Yes.

920
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:46,723
I think you're some kind
of deviated "prevert."

921
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:49,518
I think Ripper found out
about your "preversion"...

922
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:54,064
...and that you were organizing some
kind of mutiny of preverts. Now, move!

923
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:57,609
I don't know anything
about any planes attacking Russia.

924
01:09:57,819 --> 01:10:01,738
I was told get Ripper on the phone
with the president of the United States.

925
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:06,451
Now, just one second.
You just said, "The president."

926
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:08,745
What about the president?

927
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:11,957
The president wants to speak
to General Ripper, doesn't he?

928
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:14,585
Now, General Ripper is dead,
is he not?

929
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:16,962
I am General Ripper's
executive officer...

930
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:19,965
...so the president will want
to speak to me, won't he?

931
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:23,802
There's a telephone box over there
and the line may be open.

932
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:26,638
You wanna talk to
the president of the United States?

933
01:10:26,848 --> 01:10:29,600
I don't want to talk to him,
I've got to talk to him.

934
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:33,312
And if you don't put that gun away
and stop this stupid nonsense...

935
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:37,441
...the court of inquiry on this
will give you such a pranging...

936
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:41,612
...you'll be lucky to end up wearing the
uniform of a bloody toilet attendant!

937
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:47,284
Okay. Go ahead.

938
01:10:47,452 --> 01:10:50,871
Try and get the president
of the United States on the phone.

939
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:56,251
If you try any preversions in there,
I'll blow your head off.

940
01:11:09,474 --> 01:11:12,100
Operator? This is
Group Captain Lionel Mandrake.

941
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:14,353
I'm speaking from
Burpelson Air Force Base.

942
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,357
Something urgent has come up and I
want you to place an emergency call...

943
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:22,444
...with President Merkin Muffley
in the Pentagon, Washington, D.C.

944
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:26,156
Burpelson 39180.

945
01:11:27,367 --> 01:11:28,283
No, I'm perfectly serious.
The president of the United States.

946
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:32,371
No, I'm perfectly serious.
The president of the United States.

947
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:35,332
Oh, I'm sorry,
I haven't got enough change.

948
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:38,919
Could you make this
a collect call, operator?

949
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:53,225
Just one second, operator.

950
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:56,186
They won't accept the call.
Have you got 55 cents?

951
01:11:56,354 --> 01:12:00,524
You don't think I'd go into combat with
loose change in my pocket, do you?

952
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:04,736
Operator, look.

953
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:08,365
Is it possible to make this
an ordinary trunk call?

954
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:11,201
Well, what do you call it?
You know....

955
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:14,329
Oh, station-to-station.

956
01:12:18,418 --> 01:12:21,920
Oh, blast!
I'm still 20 cents short.

957
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:27,175
Operator, hold on.
I shan't keep you a second.

958
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:31,388
Colonel, that Coca-Cola machine.
I want you to shoot the lock off it.

959
01:12:31,556 --> 01:12:33,557
There may be some change
in there.

960
01:12:37,103 --> 01:12:38,562
That's private property.

961
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:41,565
Can you possibly imagine
what is gonna happen to you...

962
01:12:41,733 --> 01:12:44,401
...your frame, outlook,
way of life and everything...

963
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:48,905
...when they learn you have obstructed
a telephone call to the president?

964
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:50,949
Can you imagine?

965
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:53,910
Shoot it off! Shoot with the gun!

966
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:56,705
That's what the bullets are for,
you twit!

967
01:12:56,873 --> 01:13:00,250
Okay. I'm gonna get
your money for you.

968
01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:02,669
But if you don't get the president
on the phone...

969
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:04,421
...know what's gonna happen?

970
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:08,508
You're gonna have to answer
to the Coca-Cola Company.

971
01:13:17,268 --> 01:13:17,309
This is SAC
Communications Control.

972
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:20,312
This is SAC
Communications Control.

973
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:23,815
The recall code O-P-E...

974
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:27,402
...is being acknowledged "roger"
by elements of the 843 bomb wing.

975
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:30,280
...is being acknowledged "roger"
by elements of the 843 bomb wing.

976
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:32,824
These are the details:

977
01:13:33,034 --> 01:13:37,496
Missions 12, 22, 30 and 38...

978
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:41,124
...are reported destroyed
by enemy action.

979
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:45,337
All other missions have
acknowledged recall code.

980
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:49,508
This is SAC Communications Control,
over and out.

981
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:51,510
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

982
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:53,970
Gentlemen.

983
01:13:54,138 --> 01:13:55,972
Mr. President.

984
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:58,141
I'm not a sentimentalist
by nature...

985
01:13:58,309 --> 01:14:01,478
...but I think I know
what's in every heart in this room.

986
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:05,357
I think we ought to all
just bow our heads...

987
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:09,111
...and give a short prayer of thanks
for our deliverance. Lord...

988
01:14:10,321 --> 01:14:14,658
...we have heard the wings
of the Angel of Death...

989
01:14:14,826 --> 01:14:17,494
...fluttering over our heads
from the Valley of Fear.

990
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:20,497
You have seen fit to deliver us
from the forces of evil--

991
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:22,207
Excuse me, sir.

992
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:25,377
Premier Kissoff's calling again
and he's hopping mad.

993
01:14:32,218 --> 01:14:36,054
Fuel flow on active engines
and leakage has increased.

994
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:40,225
Now works out at 205.

995
01:14:41,352 --> 01:14:47,732
Estimate remaining fuel
at 8790.

996
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:54,406
Roger. Confirm 205 per minute...

997
01:14:54,574 --> 01:14:58,535
...and remaining fuel 8790.

998
01:15:05,168 --> 01:15:09,212
No, no, Dimitri,
there must be some mistake.

999
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:11,339
No, I'm certain of that.

1000
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:14,509
I'm perfectly certain
of that, Dimitri.

1001
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:18,430
Just a second.
You know what he says?

1002
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:20,891
He says one of the planes
hasn't turned back.

1003
01:15:21,058 --> 01:15:23,852
According to information
forwarded by our air staffs...

1004
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:26,646
...it's headed for
the missile complex at Laputa.

1005
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:34,446
That's impossible, Mr. President.
I mean, look at the big board.

1006
01:15:34,614 --> 01:15:37,866
Thirty-four planes, 30 recalls
acknowledged and four splashes...

1007
01:15:38,034 --> 01:15:40,869
...and one of them
was targeted for Laputa.

1008
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:47,083
Dimitri, look, we've got an
acknowledgment from every plane...

1009
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:50,295
...except the four
you've shot down.

1010
01:15:56,969 --> 01:15:59,638
He-- Hang on a second, Dimitri.

1011
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:03,433
He says their air defense now only
claims three aircraft confirmed.

1012
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:05,977
The fourth may only be damaged.

1013
01:16:08,189 --> 01:16:12,484
Mr. President, I'm beginning to smell
a big, fat, Commie rat.

1014
01:16:12,652 --> 01:16:16,279
I mean, supposing Kissoff
is lying about that fourth plane...

1015
01:16:16,447 --> 01:16:18,657
...just looking for an excuse
to clobber us.

1016
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:21,993
If the spaghetti hits the fan now,
we're in trouble.

1017
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:27,832
Dimitri, look,
if this report is true...

1018
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,586
...and the plane manages
to bomb the target...

1019
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:35,840
...is this gonna set off
the doomsday machine?

1020
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:41,137
Are you sure?

1021
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:46,851
Well, I guess you're just gonna have
to get that plane, Dimitri.

1022
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:49,980
I'm sorry they're jamming
your radar and flying so low...

1023
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:54,025
...but they're trained to do it,
you know? It's initiative.

1024
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:58,530
Look, Dimitri, you know
exactly where they're going...

1025
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:03,034
...and I'm sure your entire air defense
can stop a single plane.

1026
01:17:04,245 --> 01:17:06,871
Listen, it's not gonna help
either one of us...

1027
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:10,166
...if the doomsday machine
goes off, now, is it?

1028
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:16,381
Dimitri, there's no point in you getting
hysterical at a moment like this!

1029
01:17:16,549 --> 01:17:20,677
Dimitri. Keep your feet on the ground
while you're talking, Dimitri.

1030
01:17:20,845 --> 01:17:23,013
I am not-- I am not getting--

1031
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:27,517
No, Dimitri, I'm just worried,
that's all.

1032
01:17:27,685 --> 01:17:30,645
Look, if our air staff say
its primary target is Laputa...

1033
01:17:30,813 --> 01:17:34,691
...and its secondary target is
Borchov, I mean, it's true, Dimitri.

1034
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:36,151
You've gotta believe it!

1035
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:39,988
Look, can I--? Dimitri, can I give
you just one word--?

1036
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:43,366
Can I give you just one word
of advice, Dimitri?

1037
01:17:43,534 --> 01:17:45,076
Listen, Dimitri.

1038
01:17:45,244 --> 01:17:48,705
Put everything you've got into those
two sectors and you can't miss!

1039
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:58,757
Sir, if we continue to lose fuel
at the present rate...

1040
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:02,677
...I estimate we only have
38 minutes flying time...

1041
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:05,555
...which will not even take us
as far as the primary.

1042
01:18:06,057 --> 01:18:09,517
Doggone it, Sweets, you told me
that you could get me to the primary!

1043
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:13,438
I'm sorry, sir. That estimate was based
on the original loss rate factor...

1044
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:15,273
...not at 205.

1045
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:17,692
I don't give a hoot in hell
how you do it...

1046
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:18,693
...just get me to the primary,
you hear?

1047
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:19,903
...just get me to the primary,
you hear?

1048
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:23,406
I'm sorry, sir,
but those are the figures.

1049
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:26,743
We'll be lucky to reach
weather ship at Tango Delta.

1050
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:28,953
Well, shoot!

1051
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:32,874
We ain't come this far just
to dump this thing in the drink.

1052
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:35,418
What's the nearest target
of opportunity?

1053
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:46,971
Sir, if the rate of loss
does not increase...

1054
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:50,809
...we have a chance
to reach target 384...

1055
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:55,730
...grid coordinate 003 691...

1056
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:59,651
...and possibly make it from there
to the Tango Delta weather ship.

1057
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:01,820
What kind of a target
is that, anyhow?

1058
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:05,824
Sir, that's the ICBM
complex at Kotloss.

1059
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:11,663
All right.
Designating new target: 384.

1060
01:19:11,831 --> 01:19:14,791
Give me a heading on that as soon
as you get it worked out.

1061
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:31,808
Well, we'll keep our fingers crossed.
Remember, we're all in this together.

1062
01:19:31,976 --> 01:19:35,395
We're right behind you,
we're with you all the way.

1063
01:19:35,855 --> 01:19:39,149
Yes. Well, we'll keep the line open.

1064
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:41,025
All right, Dimitri.

1065
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:48,158
General Turgidson, is there really
a chance for that plane to get through?

1066
01:19:49,869 --> 01:19:52,203
Mr. President,
if I may speak freely.

1067
01:19:52,413 --> 01:19:55,957
The Russki talks big, but frankly,
we think he's short of know-how.

1068
01:19:56,125 --> 01:20:00,503
You can't expect ignorant peons to
understand a machine like our boys.

1069
01:20:00,671 --> 01:20:02,672
And that's not meant as an insult.

1070
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:05,341
We all know how much guts
the average Russki's got.

1071
01:20:05,509 --> 01:20:08,845
Look at all of them the Nazis
killed off, they still wouldn't quit!

1072
01:20:09,013 --> 01:20:10,847
Can't you stick to the point?

1073
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:14,684
Well, sir, if the pilot's good,
see--

1074
01:20:14,852 --> 01:20:18,897
I mean, if he's really sharp,
he can barrel that baby in so low.

1075
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:23,485
You ought to see it. It's a sight!
A big plane, like a '52...

1076
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:26,571
...its jet exhaust frying chickens
in the barnyard!

1077
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:29,824
-Yeah, but has he got a chance?
-Has he got a chance?

1078
01:20:29,992 --> 01:20:31,367
Hell, ye--

1079
01:20:56,894 --> 01:20:58,228

1118
01:23:56,407 --> 01:24:00,284
Stay on the bomb run, Ace. I'm going
down below and see what I can do.

1119
01:24:13,257 --> 01:24:14,632
Stay on the bomb run, boys.

1120
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:18,970

Where in hell is Major Kong?

1144
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:11,434
What about Major Kong?

1145
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:40,254
Mr. President, I would not
rule out the chance...

1146
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:43,257
Mr. President, I would not
rule out the chance...

1147
01:27:43,425 --> 01:27:46,385
...to preserve a nucleus
of human specimens.

1148
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:49,430
It would be quite easy...

1149
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:56,854
...at the bottom of some
of our deeper mineshafts.

1150
01:27:57,022 --> 01:28:01,776
The radioactivity would not penetrate
a mine some thousands of feet deep.

1151
01:28:01,944 --> 01:28:06,113
And in a matter of weeks, sufficient
improvements in dwelling space...

1152
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:08,115
...could easily be provided.

1153
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:10,534
How long would you have
to stay down there?

1154
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:13,621
Well, let's see now....

1155
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:17,667
Cobalt thorium G.

1156
01:28:27,928 --> 01:28:31,722
Radioactive half-life of....

1157
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:38,562
I would think that....
Possibly 100 years.

1158
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:44,860
You mean people could actually
stay down there for 100 years?

1159
01:28:45,028 --> 01:28:47,154
It would not be difficult,
mein Führer.

1160
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:49,407
Nuclear reactors could--

1161
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:51,867
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

1162
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:55,746
Nuclear reactors could provide
power almost indefinitely.

1163
01:28:55,914 --> 01:28:58,666
Greenhouses could maintain
plant life.

1164
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:02,211
Animals could be bred
and slaughtered.

1165
01:29:02,379 --> 01:29:04,338
A quick survey would have
to be made...

1166
01:29:04,506 --> 01:29:06,841
...of the available mine sites
in the country.

1167
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:10,594
But I would guess
that a dwelling space...

1168
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:14,432
...for several hundred thousand of
our people could easily be provided.

1169
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:17,601
Well, I would hate
to have to decide...

1170
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:20,604
...who stays up
and who goes down.

1171
01:29:20,772 --> 01:29:24,567
Well, that would not be necessary,
Mr. President.

1172
01:29:24,735 --> 01:29:27,528
It could easily be accomplished
with a computer.

1173
01:29:27,696 --> 01:29:29,905
The computer could
be set and programmed...

1174
01:29:30,073 --> 01:29:33,034
...to accept factors
from youth, health...

1175
01:29:33,201 --> 01:29:36,245
...sexual fertility, intelligence...

1176
01:29:36,413 --> 01:29:38,789
...and a cross-section
of necessary skills.

1177
01:29:39,041 --> 01:29:41,208
Of course, it would be
absolutely vital...

1178
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:43,377
...that our top government
and military men be included...

1179
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:45,254
...that our top government
and military men be included...

1180
01:29:45,422 --> 01:29:50,217
...to foster and impart the required
principles of leadership and tradition.

1181
01:29:56,099 --> 01:29:59,101
Naturally, they would breed
prodigiously.

1182
01:29:59,269 --> 01:30:03,064
There would be much time
and little to do.

1183
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:08,486
But with the proper breeding
techniques and a ratio of, say...

1184
01:30:08,653 --> 01:30:11,322
... 10 females to each male...

1185
01:30:11,531 --> 01:30:16,077
...they could then work their way back
to the present gross national product...

1186
01:30:16,244 --> 01:30:18,662
...within, say, 20 years.

1187
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:23,501
But look here, doctor.
Wouldn't this nucleus of survivors...

1188
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:27,004
...be so grief-stricken
and anguished that they'd...

1189
01:30:27,172 --> 01:30:30,591
...well, envy the dead
and not wanna go on living?

1190
01:30:30,759 --> 01:30:33,552
No, sir. Excuse me.

1191
01:30:42,646 --> 01:30:46,690
No, sir. When they go down into the
mine, everyone would still be alive.

1192
01:30:46,858 --> 01:30:48,859
There would be
no shocking memories...

1193
01:30:49,027 --> 01:30:53,614
...the prevailing emotion will be one
of nostalgia for those left behind...

1194
01:30:53,782 --> 01:30:59,954
...combined with a spirit of bold
curiosity for the adventure ahead!

1195
01:31:16,638 --> 01:31:18,556
Doctor...

1196
01:31:20,725 --> 01:31:26,147
...you mentioned the ratio
of 10 women to each man.

1197
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:29,358
Now, wouldn't that necessitate
the abandonment...

1198
01:31:29,526 --> 01:31:33,195
...of the so-called
monogamous sexual relationship?

1199
01:31:33,363 --> 01:31:34,488
I mean, as far as men
were concerned?

1200
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:36,907
I mean, as far as men
were concerned?

1201
01:31:37,075 --> 01:31:38,367
Regrettably, yes.

1202
01:31:38,535 --> 01:31:43,747
But it is, you know, a sacrifice required
for the future of the human race.

1203
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:49,545
I hasten to add that since each man
will be required to do prodigious...

1204
01:31:50,547 --> 01:31:52,381
...service along these lines...

1205
01:31:52,549 --> 01:31:56,427
...the women will have to be selected
for their sexual characteristics...

1206
01:31:56,595 --> 01:32:00,264
...which will have to be of
a highly stimulating nature.

1207
01:32:00,432 --> 01:32:04,226
I must confess, you have an
astonishingly good idea there, doctor.

1208
01:32:05,395 --> 01:32:06,770
Thank you, sir.

1209
01:32:07,397 --> 01:32:11,775
I think we ought to look at this from
the military point of view. I mean....

1210
01:32:12,736 --> 01:32:16,614
Supposing the Russkies stashed away
some big bombs, see, and we didn't?

1211
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:19,575
When they come out in 100 years,
they could take over!

1212
01:32:19,743 --> 01:32:21,285
I agree, Mr. President.

1213
01:32:21,453 --> 01:32:25,289
They might try a sneak attack so they
could take over our mineshaft space.

1214
01:32:25,457 --> 01:32:29,793
It'd be extremely naive of us to imagine
that these new developments...

1215
01:32:29,961 --> 01:32:32,963
...are gonna cause any change
in Soviet expansionist policy!

1216
01:32:33,173 --> 01:32:35,633
I mean, we must be
increasingly on the alert...

1217
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,469
...to prevent them from taking over
mineshaft space...

1218
01:32:38,678 --> 01:32:40,471
...in order to breed more
than we do...

1219
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:43,724
...thus knocking us out through
superior numbers when we emerge!

1220
01:32:43,892 --> 01:32:47,895
Mr. President, we must not allow
a mineshaft gap!

1221
01:32:48,063 --> 01:32:49,813
Sir!

1222
01:32:49,981 --> 01:32:52,441
I have a plan.
