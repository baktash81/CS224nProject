Michelle, please don't hang up.

00:03:30,493 --> 00:03:32,448
Just talk to me, okay?

4
00:03:32,515 --> 00:03:34,262
I can't believe you just left.

5
00:03:35,737 --> 00:03:36,742
Michelle

6
00:03:37,688 --> 00:03:39,000
Come back.

7
00:03:41,142 --> 00:03:42,515
Please say something.

8
00:03:44,275 --> 00:03:46,466
Michelle?  Talk to me.

9
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,795
Look, we had an argument, couples fight,
that is ..

10
00:03:49,826 --> 00:03:52,497
No reason to just leave everything behind.

11
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:57,130
Running away isn't going to help anything.
Michelle, please ..

Please ..

23
00:09:24,937 --> 00:09:26,573
Please don't hurt me.

Please,

25
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,800
Just let me go, okay? I won't tell anybody,
I promise.

26
00:09:38,013 --> 00:09:40,208
Please just let me go.  Please.

27
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:42,951
You need fluids.

28
00:09:43,142 --> 00:09:44,773
You were in shock.

29
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,693
What're you going to do to me?

30
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,386
I'm going to keep you alive.

31
00:10:03,422 --> 00:10:05,724
Work on getting handy with these.

32
00:10:11,124 --> 00:10:13,040
My boyfriend was expecting me.

33
00:10:14,222 --> 00:10:15,902
He'll send the cops looking.

34
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,640
I'm sorry ..

35
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:20,724
But no one is looking for you.

36
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:04,360
You got some fight in you.

37
00:14:07,506 --> 00:14:09,111
I can respect that.

38
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,435
But don't even think about trying that again.

39
00:14:16,137 --> 00:14:18,226
You're lucky to be here at all.

40
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,351
My generosity only extends .. so far.

41
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,426
Eggs,

42
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,431
Tylenol to help with your pain.

43
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,800
Please .. please .. just let me go.

44
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,235
- Please.
- There's nowhere to go, Michelle.

45
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,040
That looks pretty [???].

46
00:14:42,893 --> 00:14:45,880
Given it as how I saved your life,
I think that's acceptable.

47
00:14:46,222 --> 00:14:48,195
You're lucky to be here at all.

48
00:14:50,248 --> 00:14:52,457
- What do you mean?
- I found you.

49
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,288
And I saved your life, by bringing you here.

50
00:14:57,031 --> 00:14:58,644
I don't understand,

51
00:15:11,093 --> 00:15:12,813
There's been an attack.

52
00:15:16,195 --> 00:15:17,137
What?

53
00:15:17,324 --> 00:15:19,902
An attack. A big one.

54
00:15:20,293 --> 00:15:22,955
I'm not sure yet if it's chemical, or nuclear.

55
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,635
But down here we're safe.

56
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,004
And where are we, exactly?

57
00:15:29,084 --> 00:15:30,920
Underneath my farmhouse.

58
00:15:31,386 --> 00:15:33,875
40 miles outside of Lake Charles.

59
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:39,484
- I ..  was driving north of here.
- You were in an accident.

60
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,800
You were turned over on the side of the road.
I was driving by, and I saw you.

61
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,348
I saved your life, Michelle.

62
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,475
I couldn't just leave you there.

63
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,155
Thank you so much, for saving my life.  I ..

64
00:16:05,888 --> 00:16:08,684
I guess I should, I should go to a hospital, now.

65
00:16:11,648 --> 00:16:13,244
You can't leave.

66
00:16:15,662 --> 00:16:18,266
An attack means all of them.

67
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,666
Which contaminates the air above ground.
That's, that's how it works.

68
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,284
How, how long do we have to wait until it's safe?

69
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,991
Depends on the proximity to the closest blast.
One year, maybe two.

70
00:16:31,551 --> 00:16:34,715
And that's if we're, we're talking
about weapons that we know of.

71
00:16:35,222 --> 00:16:39,840
Russians were developing some nasty stuff.
And it the martians finally found a way to get here.

72
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:44,955
Their weapons will, will make our nukes
look like, like sticks and stones.

73
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,631
Luckily,

74
00:16:50,546 --> 00:16:52,208
I prepared for this.

75
00:17:02,608 --> 00:17:04,444
I need to use your phone, then,

76
00:17:05,346 --> 00:17:08,622
To call my family.
And, and tell them that I'm safe here.

77
00:17:09,035 --> 00:17:12,337
- And make sure they're okay.
- Michelle, they're not okay.

78
00:17:15,413 --> 00:17:16,595
How do you know that?

79
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,995
Everyone outside of here is dead.

80
00:17:30,022 --> 00:17:32,164
What about you?
Don't you have a family?

81
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:35,050
No

82
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,155
Who's that?

83
00:17:39,702 --> 00:17:40,906
Excuse me.

84
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,134
What is it now?

85
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,671
Wait.

86
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,857
You know what, Michelle?
I'm going to tell you, what I told him..

87
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,417
You need to eat, you need to sleep,

88
00:18:09,533 --> 00:18:12,431
And you need to start showing me a
little bit of appreciation.

89
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,084
My name is Howard, by the way.

90
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:07,408
God, oh shit.

91
00:19:08,155 --> 00:19:09,640
I'm sorry,

92
00:19:13,324 --> 00:19:16,080
Sorry about that.  I didn't mean to ..

93
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:17,620
Scare you.

94
00:19:17,684 --> 00:19:20,364
You, hmm,  hmm, you hungry?

95
00:19:26,377 --> 00:19:28,488
So how're you doing, huh?  You okay?

96
00:19:30,293 --> 00:19:31,515
What is this?

97
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:32,977
It's a bunker.

98
00:19:33,653 --> 00:19:36,613
Your room is a bit of a fixer-upper, but ..

99
00:19:36,684 --> 00:19:38,453
At least you got the door.

100
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,013
A scary door, but you still got the door.

101
00:19:42,524 --> 00:19:44,284
How long have you been down here?

102
00:19:44,448 --> 00:19:48,440
A couple of days, I think.  You know,
it's actually kind of hard to tell.

103
00:19:48,546 --> 00:19:51,826
No windows, the sunlight, and everything.

104
00:19:52,111 --> 00:19:53,990
I mean, how do we get out of here?

105
00:19:55,537 --> 00:19:56,960
He didn't tell you?

106
00:19:57,973 --> 00:19:59,035
About ..

107
00:20:02,631 --> 00:20:05,128
Getting out of here,
is the last thing you want to do.

108
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:07,631
Cause the air out there,

109
00:20:08,368 --> 00:20:09,715
It's contaminated.

110
00:20:11,484 --> 00:20:13,210
I see you've met Emmett

111
00:20:16,702 --> 00:20:19,580
- What happened to him?
- He did that to himself.

112
00:20:20,031 --> 00:20:22,382
And his stumbling around isn't helping anything.

113
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:23,955
What you heard earlier,

114
00:20:24,062 --> 00:20:28,190
Was him knocking over a shelf with
a whole week's worth of food.

115
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,444
Which he's sorry for, correct?

116
00:20:32,728 --> 00:20:33,760
Totally.

117
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,537
Let's go.  Bathroom time.

118
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:56,475
This is the common are.  Good for R&R.

119
00:20:56,777 --> 00:20:59,790
As you can see, I've planned for a long stay.

120
00:21:00,062 --> 00:21:03,590
The applaponic(???) system cleans
the air and keeps it fresh.

121
00:21:04,004 --> 00:21:07,297
This is the living room.
Help yourself to any reading.

122
00:21:07,742 --> 00:21:09,835
If you like to watch films,

123
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,826
I have some on DVD and VHS cassette.

124
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:16,533
Just make sure you put them back
in their sleeve when they're done.

125
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:21,782
The kitchen is fully functional. There's
an electric stove, refrigerator.

126
00:21:22,146 --> 00:21:24,146
Freezer, silverware.

127
00:21:24,404 --> 00:21:27,780
And that table is a family heirloom,
which means watch your glasses.

128
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,862
Always use coasters and placemats.

129
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,871
Keep you hands to yourself!

130
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:37,773
Understand?

131
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:39,884
No touching.

132
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,546
Take a seat.

133
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,226
This way.

134
00:22:11,835 --> 00:22:13,586
This is my private space

135
00:22:14,568 --> 00:22:17,702
Off-limits,
unless I give express permission.

136
00:22:18,648 --> 00:22:19,977
Go ahead.

137
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,124
- Nah, I don't need to.
- You will though.

138
00:22:25,271 --> 00:22:27,804
And I've got to pace these things out,
so please.

139
00:22:30,555 --> 00:22:33,591
- I need privacy.
- You're welcome to close the curtain.

140
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,951
I can't with you standing there.

141
00:22:40,515 --> 00:22:45,382
And I can't trust you not to burn this
place down. This is for my own safety.

142
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,991
I'm not some .. pervert.  Just go.

143
00:23:03,786 --> 00:23:05,671
Don't flush unless you've gone.

144
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:08,724
Can't afford wasting flushes.

145
00:23:16,973 --> 00:23:18,213
Take a seat.

146
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,724
Are you hungry?

147
00:23:25,657 --> 00:23:26,844
Those are Megan's.

148
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,555
She never went anywhere without two
or three of those things.

149
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,764
Who's Megan?

150
00:23:33,493 --> 00:23:35,742
Megan's not with us anymore.

151
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:43,960
Don't worry.  Just the generator.

152
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:49,404
Maybe it's a car up front.

153
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,662
- That's not possible.
-  I heard one earlier.

154
00:23:54,951 --> 00:23:55,822
Above my room.

155
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,213
If you had heard a car,
the driver would be long dead by now.

156
00:23:59,684 --> 00:24:03,151
Shouldn't we at least try
.. to call the police?

157
00:24:04,391 --> 00:24:07,662
- Someone to find out what actually happened?
- There's no one left to call.

158
00:24:07,817 --> 00:24:10,302
See that?  Nothing's coming through.

159
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,275
You think I sound crazy.

160
00:24:23,391 --> 00:24:25,284
It's amazing, you people..

161
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:29,555
You wear helmets when you ride your bikes,
you have seat-belts,

162
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,853
You're in your cars,
you have alarm systems to protect your homes.

163
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,893
But what do you do when those alarms go off?

164
00:24:36,448 --> 00:24:40,813
Crazy, is building your ark after
the flood is already come.

165
00:24:48,373 --> 00:24:51,217
I think now might be time you
met Frank and Mildred.

166
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:39,136
Closest I can get to in airlock.

167
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,257
See?

168
00:26:14,048 --> 00:26:15,315
What happened to them?

169
00:26:15,724 --> 00:26:17,657
They weren't as lucky as you.

170
00:26:18,182 --> 00:26:19,720
It's the air, Michelle.

171
00:26:19,871 --> 00:26:21,940
That's what happens when you get exposed.

172
00:26:38,488 --> 00:26:42,306
I keep this door sealed, at all times.

173
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,542
No one comes in or out.

174
00:27:01,311 --> 00:27:02,946
Met Frank and Mildred, huh?

175
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,764
It's funny, right?

176
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:11,408
The whole world ends.  And the thing's he's
most upset about is a pair of dead pigs.

177
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,831
You gonna need some .. uh, reading material.

178
00:27:16,742 --> 00:27:19,017
That's all there is (???), sorry.

179
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,097
My idead of how to learn to do
a french braid, so..

180
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:32,173
If you want me to do that for you,
just let me know.

181
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,350
What do you know about him?

182
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:45,991
He was in the Navy, I know that.

183
00:27:47,231 --> 00:27:50,457
I guess he did, uh,
some stuff with satellites.

184
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,333
What kinds of stuff?

185
00:27:54,217 --> 00:27:56,071
Satellite .. stuff.

186
00:27:57,902 --> 00:27:59,524
And what brought him out here?

187
00:28:00,146 --> 00:28:01,444
I'm not sure.

188
00:28:02,942 --> 00:28:04,848
He bought this property a whle back.

189
00:28:05,937 --> 00:28:10,075
I never paid much attention, until he
hired me to help him get this place set up.

190
00:28:11,817 --> 00:28:13,600
The work, was, uh..

191
00:28:13,813 --> 00:28:15,853
Entertaining, though, that's for sure.

192
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,991
You know, Howard, is like a black belt
in conspiracy theories.

193
00:28:22,022 --> 00:28:25,404
Plus, you know, how often do you get
hired to build the doomsday bunker?

194
00:28:29,382 --> 00:28:30,800
He .. kidnapped you?

195
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:33,035
No.

196
00:28:35,035 --> 00:28:36,862
What happened to your arm?
You were trying to escape?

197
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,871
I was trying to get in.

198
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,364
And I watched Howard build this
place, piece by piece, for years.

199
00:28:44,502 --> 00:28:45,946
He was always talking about..

200
00:28:46,804 --> 00:28:48,368
you know, possible attacks,

201
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:52,200
Al-Qeda, Russia, South Korea,

202
00:28:52,248 --> 00:28:55,017
- You mean North Korea?
- the, the.. is that the Korean one?

203
00:28:57,315 --> 00:28:58,702
Yeah, that one.  Hmm ..

204
00:28:59,511 --> 00:29:03,777
And, hmm, you know. Pour all his money into this
place, took to it, like his life depended on it.

205
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,937
Which,.. you know,

206
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:09,737
That stays with you.

207
00:29:13,662 --> 00:29:14,755
So,

208
00:29:17,284 --> 00:29:18,577
He told all this,

209
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,617
While you're building his bomb shelter,

210
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,497
And now he says that ..

211
00:29:24,786 --> 00:29:27,195
The air is contaminated, and everybody's dead.

212
00:29:29,093 --> 00:29:32,026
Yeah, I know what you're getting at.
But there's more to it.

213
00:29:32,111 --> 00:29:33,608
Howard abducted me.

214
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,164
He drove me off the road,
and he dragged me here.

215
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:42,457
So whatever he's telling you
about the .. air,

216
00:29:43,022 --> 00:29:47,631
- Some big attack. The purpose of this shelter, is a lie.
- No, no way.

217
00:29:49,764 --> 00:29:51,302
The attack, I saw it myself.

218
00:29:51,942 --> 00:29:53,062
What do you mean?

219
00:29:54,413 --> 00:29:55,897
Coming on my way from work,

220
00:29:57,977 --> 00:29:59,631
And, looked like a flash.

221
00:30:00,831 --> 00:30:01,955
Bright red,

222
00:30:03,128 --> 00:30:05,217
Like an explosion, from way far off.

223
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:08,675
Wasn't like fireworks,

224
00:30:10,804 --> 00:30:13,782
No, it was more this like something
your read about in the bible.

225
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,177
So what you saw was a flashing light?
Lightning?

226
00:30:22,302 --> 00:30:25,204
- Fire that cleared up?
- I'm not .. explaining it right.

227
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,013
This wasn't like anything I've ever seen.

228
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,848
Right here,

229
00:30:28,915 --> 00:30:29,897
Above us.

230
00:30:33,657 --> 00:30:35,060
Did you hear someone?

231
00:30:35,226 --> 00:30:36,448
Right over me (???).

232
00:30:41,288 --> 00:30:42,760
That's impossible.

233
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,293
- The, the air, is ..
- What, it's contaminated?

234
00:30:47,604 --> 00:30:50,253
- How do you know that?
- Because I told him.

235
00:30:52,786 --> 00:30:53,897
Dinner's ready.

236
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,626
I see you two are getting along?

237
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:46,608
How's that sauce?

238
00:31:47,586 --> 00:31:50,644
- It's fine,
- As cooks go, I'm okay.

239
00:31:51,711 --> 00:31:53,337
Not great, but okay.

240
00:31:54,382 --> 00:31:56,120
Megan was a good cook.

241
00:31:57,768 --> 00:31:59,773
You'll learn a little cooking.

242
00:32:10,533 --> 00:32:11,693
It's delicious.

243
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:14,857
It's the best sauce I ever tasted.

244
00:32:15,502 --> 00:32:16,893
Are you being funny?

245
00:32:16,946 --> 00:32:18,471
No, I mean ..

246
00:32:19,226 --> 00:32:21,471
Considering the alternative,
which is, you know..

247
00:32:22,071 --> 00:32:25,720
Get burned up in a chemical
attack, or nuclear ..

248
00:32:26,293 --> 00:32:28,608
I say being alive, and down here is ..

249
00:32:29,262 --> 00:32:32,031
It's made a fried turd taste
pretty good, so..

250
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,991
Best damn sauce I ever had.

251
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:42,244
and [???] you point,
and please watch your language at the table.

252
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,004
Right.

253
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,933
You know what I haven't been able to
get out of my head, for some reason.

254
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,742
Ever since I got down here,

255
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,466
Tatoos.

256
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,760
I always wanted one.

257
00:33:00,088 --> 00:33:04,404
But I never got any.  Because everyone always said, nah, no,
Emmett you'll never get a decent job if you got it.

258
00:33:04,822 --> 00:33:06,053
Whatever

259
00:33:06,306 --> 00:33:07,840
Like that matters now, right?

260
00:33:09,106 --> 00:33:12,511
Tell you what, I had know this was coming,
I'd gotten like 50 of them.

261
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,355
That's where I'm at.

262
00:33:14,813 --> 00:33:19,422
I would look like a circus freak or something.
I would just be covered.  Head to toe, tattoos all over ..

263
00:33:19,684 --> 00:33:23,720
Everywhere, face, shirt, right there.
Across my forehead.

264
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:27,146
Just my name, Emmett.

265
00:33:27,835 --> 00:33:28,857
Or, you know..

266
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,786
- "Thug Life"
- [Michelle laughs]

267
00:33:32,097 --> 00:33:33,066
- 'YOLO'

268
00:33:33,213 --> 00:33:37,182
I don't even know what that means, but, I hear
people saying it all the time.  So it must be cool.

269
00:33:41,857 --> 00:33:43,226
Hey, what about you, Howard?

270
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,333
Anything you wish you'd done?

271
00:33:52,457 --> 00:33:54,084
In all honesty, no.

272
00:33:55,386 --> 00:33:56,280
No?

273
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,133
No crazy nights in Vegas?,

274
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,684
Maybe, ah, take a pilgrimage to Waco?

275
00:34:07,155 --> 00:34:09,213
Everything I wanted to do, I did.

276
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:12,160
I focused on being prepared.

277
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,702
And I was.

278
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,648
And here we are.

279
00:34:28,528 --> 00:34:29,782
Oh, my goodness..

280
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,644
Is that Monopoly?

281
00:34:33,048 --> 00:34:34,300
There we go.

282
00:34:34,924 --> 00:34:36,626
Yeah, that's how we kill the time.

283
00:34:37,053 --> 00:34:41,115
I mean, what you say?  We're going to be
down here like what, a year, two, three?

284
00:34:42,386 --> 00:34:45,417
Bet you if we started a game right now,
we might even get halfway finished..

285
00:34:45,462 --> 00:34:46,560
Stop talking!

286
00:34:55,662 --> 00:34:58,662
You don't need to make jokes about how
long we're going to be down here.

287
00:34:58,737 --> 00:35:01,017
When nobody knows how long that's going to be.

288
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:03,555
You humor is not funny.

289
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:07,430
I don't appreciate it while I'm trying
to eat, and neither does Michelle.

290
00:35:07,475 --> 00:35:10,617
Now please shut up, and let us eat in peace.

291
00:35:39,186 --> 00:35:40,311
Emmett?

292
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,186
Pass me a napkin.

293
00:35:52,648 --> 00:35:53,835
I know what you're saying.

294
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,635
I never could finish Monopoly.

295
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:59,466
That game really does take forever, right?

296
00:36:00,546 --> 00:36:02,102
For me though, it was .. hmm,

297
00:36:03,026 --> 00:36:06,048
'Chutes, and Ladders'.  Ahmm,

298
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,102
'Sorry',

299
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,826
and 'Trouble'.

300
00:36:10,275 --> 00:36:13,697
And that thing with the dice, and that thing
that you press, what is that called?

301
00:36:13,742 --> 00:36:17,013
That,  that .. 'PoppleMatic Bubble!',
yeah, right!

302
00:36:17,537 --> 00:36:19,795
You ever play that, what was it, 'Operation'?

303
00:36:20,168 --> 00:36:22,626
- Loath 'Operation"
- Oh, man, I couldn't play that game.

304
00:36:23,897 --> 00:36:26,866
That noise that thing would make
when you hit that edge, when..

305
00:36:27,462 --> 00:36:29,680
- Good lord,
- That was scary.

306
00:36:30,871 --> 00:36:32,217
Can you give me the salt?

307
00:36:35,573 --> 00:36:36,395
Please?

308
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,008
Ah, shoot.  Sorry.

309
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,551
I'm going to need the pepper also,

310
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:56,888
- What exactly do you think you're doing?
- I'm just asking for the pepper.

311
00:36:56,951 --> 00:36:59,680
- The hell you were?  What was that?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

312
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:01,906
You trying to insult me?

313
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,084
Here in a shelter that I built,
that's keeping you alive?

314
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:09,128
You don't think I see what you just did?

315
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,448
Is that how you thank me for saving your life?

316
00:37:12,533 --> 00:37:14,120
- Calm down.
- Shut Up!

317
00:37:14,248 --> 00:37:16,430
Shut Up!  And stay in your seat!

318
00:37:23,031 --> 00:37:23,857
Is it?

319
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,271
Let me tell you,

320
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:29,440
I know what a traitor looks like,

321
00:37:29,502 --> 00:37:30,795
Understand?

322
00:37:32,644 --> 00:37:37,626
I have shown you nothing but
generosity, and hospitality.

323
00:37:39,982 --> 00:37:42,031
I want you to apologize.

324
00:37:43,973 --> 00:37:46,151
And tell me you're going to behave.

325
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,191
I will.

326
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:55,755
You will what?

327
00:37:58,991 --> 00:38:00,582
I'll behave.

328
00:38:02,773 --> 00:38:04,426
And I'm so sorry.

329
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,977
You have to stay hydrated, [???].

330
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,960
It's easy to forget down here.

331
00:38:52,475 --> 00:38:53,404
What's wrong?

332
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,766
Nothing

333
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:09,653
Where are my keys?

334
00:39:27,964 --> 00:39:29,026
Michelle!

335
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:30,382
Stop!

336
00:39:42,928 --> 00:39:44,106
Give me those keys!

337
00:39:45,604 --> 00:39:46,671
- Come on.
- I'm going.

338
00:39:46,706 --> 00:39:47,910
No! No! [???]

339
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,364
No! Don't do it!

340
00:40:04,413 --> 00:40:05,330
No!

341
00:40:05,386 --> 00:40:06,840
Don't open that door!

342
00:40:10,528 --> 00:40:11,582
It's a car!

343
00:40:12,106 --> 00:40:14,510
It's a car!  I see a car!

344
00:40:14,591 --> 00:40:16,266
Here!  Here!

345
00:40:17,235 --> 00:40:18,417
Here!

346
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:20,116
Michelle, listen to me, don't do it!

347
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,488
Help me!

348
00:40:26,977 --> 00:40:28,844
- There's a woman.
- Open the door.

349
00:40:30,782 --> 00:40:34,860
- I just.. I want to come inside.
- She looks hurt, she wants me to let her in!

350
00:40:34,906 --> 00:40:37,330
Do not let her in!

351
00:40:37,422 --> 00:40:39,100
Look at her face, Michelle!

352
00:40:39,164 --> 00:40:43,440
No, no, no .. no, no.

353
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:47,010
Please open,  I don't want to die.

354
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,770
Please, help me, I don't want to die.

355
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:55,652
Just a little, oh , please open the door.

356
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,688
- Open it.
- She's begging me!

357
00:40:58,755 --> 00:41:00,390
You can't help her!

358
00:41:00,515 --> 00:41:02,890
- Nobody can.
- It'll be okay.

359
00:41:02,973 --> 00:41:06,830
[???] It' be okay, all of us.

360
00:41:08,062 --> 00:41:09,315
Open the door!

361
00:41:09,355 --> 00:41:10,500
Don't listen to her!

362
00:41:10,573 --> 00:41:13,200
Open the door, you bitch!

363
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,538
Let me in!

364
00:41:15,582 --> 00:41:21,540
Let me in!   Let me in!   Let me in!

365
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:24,380
Now!

366
00:41:24,777 --> 00:41:26,880
Now.  Now!

367
00:41:27,315 --> 00:41:28,910
Now!

368
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,150
Open!

369
00:41:59,111 --> 00:42:00,810
I know it's hard.

370
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:04,537
Realizing they're all gone.

371
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,435
The ones you love.

372
00:42:17,808 --> 00:42:20,017
I have something to confess to you.

373
00:42:22,297 --> 00:42:24,333
I crashed into your car.

374
00:42:25,128 --> 00:42:26,680
Your accident.

375
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,568
Was my fault.

376
00:42:31,653 --> 00:42:36,328
When I found out about the incoming
attack, I got frantic.

377
00:42:36,755 --> 00:42:39,395
I knew I needed to get back here
as soon as possible,

378
00:42:39,568 --> 00:42:41,822
Oh, I was driving like a maniac,

379
00:42:45,306 --> 00:42:47,204
I tried to pass you, and..

380
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:53,808
I'm the reason you went off the road.

381
00:42:55,844 --> 00:42:58,640
And I know I seem like a sensible guy,

382
00:42:59,315 --> 00:43:02,102
But, at the time, I wasn't myself.

383
00:43:04,071 --> 00:43:07,280
It was an accident.  But it was my fault.

384
00:43:09,728 --> 00:43:11,573
I was afraid to tell you.

385
00:43:15,604 --> 00:43:17,390
I'm sorry.

386
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:28,746
You should shower,

387
00:43:28,951 --> 00:43:33,253
You had the smallest amount of air that
came through the hinges, could be toxic.

388
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,964
These are Megan's.

389
00:43:38,053 --> 00:43:39,702
If you want them.

390
00:43:44,435 --> 00:43:46,511
I recognize that woman's car.

391
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:49,620
Her name was Leslie, I think.

392
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,786
You knew her?

393
00:43:53,324 --> 00:43:54,808
She was a neighbor.

394
00:43:55,848 --> 00:43:58,830
Emmett wasn't the only one
that knew about this place.

395
00:43:59,733 --> 00:44:03,577
If any others somehow survived,
they could be coming here too.

396
00:44:06,386 --> 00:44:10,146
As of Friday, kindness and generosity
are antiquated customs.

397
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:20,097
I'm going to need some stitches.

398
00:44:29,924 --> 00:44:31,475
Why, you want me to..?

399
00:44:31,551 --> 00:44:33,408
This is your doing, isn't it?

400
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:36,111
I mean,
I don't think I'm really qualified.

401
00:44:36,177 --> 00:44:37,568
I'll walk you through it.

402
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:42,945
Here.

403
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,973
Have a drink.

404
00:44:50,906 --> 00:44:52,102
What is it?

405
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:54,533
Technically, it's ..

406
00:44:54,746 --> 00:44:55,960
Vodka

407
00:44:59,648 --> 00:45:02,182
Safe.  I distill it myself.

408
00:45:12,324 --> 00:45:16,453
- I just said I distill it, I didn't say anything
about it tasting good. -- Yeah, that's awful.

409
00:45:16,515 --> 00:45:17,893
You want it on the rocks.

410
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:26,928
Little trick I taught myself as a young man
stationed on a ship, with way too much free time.

411
00:45:27,137 --> 00:45:32,008
Every now and again, if the CO was working us
too hard. We'd freeze and snap the knob off..

412
00:45:32,093 --> 00:45:34,426
the bathroom door while they were still inside.

413
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:37,662
I guess it took an hour or two, to get out

414
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,444
I'm good.

415
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:44,146
Suit yourself.  Cheers.

416
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:54,773
This is clean.

417
00:45:55,137 --> 00:45:57,453
All you need to do is .. stitch.

418
00:46:20,075 --> 00:46:21,466
You're doing fine.

419
00:46:25,697 --> 00:46:27,546
Stuff I grabbed from your car.

420
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,977
Didn't have time to bring in the booze.

421
00:46:30,404 --> 00:46:31,720
Sadly.

422
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,200
What is all that?

423
00:46:40,275 --> 00:46:42,057
I wanted to design clothes.

424
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:44,248
No wonder you were so good with the stiches.

425
00:46:46,915 --> 00:46:48,528
Megan wanted to be an artist.

426
00:46:51,777 --> 00:46:52,831
- She was your daughter?
- Yeah

427
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:05,680
She was smart, loved to read,
the magazines or just for fun.

428
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:08,764
She inhaled books.
Anything with Paris.

429
00:47:09,022 --> 00:47:11,897
She liked their movies.
Their culture, you know.

430
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:15,831
We used to have this little joke,
every once in a while, I'd ask her..

431
00:47:16,017 --> 00:47:18,035
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

432
00:47:19,386 --> 00:47:21,035
And you know what she'd say?

433
00:47:22,737 --> 00:47:24,146
French.

434
00:47:25,982 --> 00:47:26,986
Anyway,

435
00:47:27,942 --> 00:47:29,893
Her mother turned her against me.

436
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,733
Took her off to Chicago.

437
00:47:33,675 --> 00:47:35,550
People are strange creatures

438
00:47:36,524 --> 00:47:39,688
You can't always convince them that
safety is in their own  best interest

439
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,715
You don't know they're gone.

440
00:47:46,631 --> 00:47:47,684
Anyway,

441
00:47:48,022 --> 00:47:50,146
At least I tried to help them.

442
00:48:02,257 --> 00:48:04,955
Hey, you know there is nothing
you could've done for that woman

443
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:09,022
Even if you had let her in,
she still would've died.

444
00:48:14,982 --> 00:48:18,524
You asked earlier about .. regrets,

445
00:48:21,102 --> 00:48:22,657
Yeah, I got some of those.

446
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,448
Welcome to the club.

447
00:48:35,853 --> 00:48:38,826
I mean, I lived my life
in a 40-mile radius.

448
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:43,524
And that was by design,
I made sure that happened.

449
00:48:45,204 --> 00:48:47,275
I was so fast in high school,

450
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:49,920
I even managed to outrun my bad grades.

451
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:56,511
I was all-state track,

452
00:48:56,746 --> 00:48:58,404
Three years in a row.

453
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:03,431
Caught a full ride to Louisiana Tech
up there in Ruston.

454
00:49:07,693 --> 00:49:10,764
I remember I spent the last
two weeks of that summer,

455
00:49:11,737 --> 00:49:15,426
Showing off the bus ticket they
sent me, to anybody who looked at it

456
00:49:17,093 --> 00:49:20,111
And then came the night
before I was supposed to leave,

457
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,822
And I just got so worried,

458
00:49:29,013 --> 00:49:31,515
About how bad I was
going to do up there

459
00:49:32,013 --> 00:49:33,968
With all those smart kids

460
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,488
So I went out of my way

461
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:43,928
To get just pissed wasted, so bad that

462
00:49:44,088 --> 00:49:46,810
There was no chance I was waking
up in in the morning.

463
00:49:49,915 --> 00:49:51,604
So I missed the bus

464
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,017
I didn't buy a ticket for the next one

465
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,844
Or the one after that.

466
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:04,484
Well, if you'd gone,
you might be dead now.

467
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,222
Well, lucky me, right?

468
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,733
Lucky us.

469
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,484
A few, a few years ago,

470
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,537
I was at a hardware store

471
00:50:22,822 --> 00:50:26,150
And there was this little girl,
with her Dad.

472
00:50:27,506 --> 00:50:30,008
And he was in a hurry,
and she wasn't keeping up.

473
00:50:31,262 --> 00:50:32,560
and he kept

474
00:50:33,715 --> 00:50:38,355
yanking on her arm,
really hard, you know.

475
00:50:40,044 --> 00:50:41,231
too hard.

476
00:50:45,551 --> 00:50:47,173
You know that feeling?

477
00:50:50,902 --> 00:50:55,733
When my Dad got that way,
my brother Collin was always there.

478
00:50:56,066 --> 00:50:59,084
To take the worst of it.
For me.

479
00:51:01,946 --> 00:51:05,160
And after seeing that little girl,
I thought maybe I could

480
00:51:05,928 --> 00:51:07,062
do that

481
00:51:08,124 --> 00:51:09,066
For her.

482
00:51:13,702 --> 00:51:15,391
But I just kept watching

483
00:51:17,982 --> 00:51:20,533
And they were about to leave,
and I'd done nothing.

484
00:51:23,493 --> 00:51:24,675
And,

485
00:51:25,377 --> 00:51:26,920
she slips

486
00:51:28,062 --> 00:51:30,462
And it throws him out off-balance
and he hits her

487
00:51:32,786 --> 00:51:35,417
And I wanted so badly to do something.

488
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,493
To help her, but

489
00:51:38,048 --> 00:51:40,537
I do what I always do
when things get hard

490
00:51:43,146 --> 00:51:45,337
I just panicked and ran.

491
00:51:50,755 --> 00:51:51,670
Look,

492
00:51:51,862 --> 00:51:55,026
We're here, we're alive.

493
00:51:56,515 --> 00:51:58,186
And that means something.

494
00:52:01,568 --> 00:52:02,791
got it?

495
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,315
You've got to be kidding me.

496
00:53:37,355 --> 00:53:38,410
What?

497
00:53:38,777 --> 00:53:40,497
We're missing pieces here.

498
00:53:41,506 --> 00:53:43,071
Look at this poor cat.

499
00:53:43,231 --> 00:53:45,884
He's been deformed,
he's got one eye.

500
00:53:46,875 --> 00:53:49,240
About to go snorkling and
everything too.

501
00:53:51,426 --> 00:53:52,777
What are you doing?

502
00:53:58,973 --> 00:54:01,730
Ooh, cornering the market on
post-apocalyptic fashion, huh?

503
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:04,940
Needs more axes and chainsaws.

504
00:54:04,995 --> 00:54:06,324
For what, she has a shotgun.

505
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,426
Yeah, what if up there it's like..

506
00:54:10,822 --> 00:54:13,008
- [???] tracks?
- Zombies.

507
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,173
Though even Howard doesn't think that one's possible.

508
00:54:17,404 --> 00:54:20,235
Though you should hear his theory
about mutant space-worms.

509
00:54:26,053 --> 00:54:27,591
What is that? Howard?

510
00:54:27,648 --> 00:54:29,613
Stay calm. We're okay.

511
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,115
- What was that?
- Quiet.

512
00:54:41,422 --> 00:54:43,337
That sounds like helicopters.

513
00:54:44,373 --> 00:54:47,368
Could be military.
But not ours.

514
00:54:48,146 --> 00:54:49,586
How can you tell?

515
00:54:49,817 --> 00:54:52,462
- 14 years in the Navy.
- What's happening up there?

516
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:58,128
My guess, those flashes that kicked
this all off,

517
00:54:58,435 --> 00:55:00,440
That was phase 1.

518
00:55:00,973 --> 00:55:05,000
Take out your opponent's population centers,
with big hits, all at once

519
00:55:05,906 --> 00:55:09,071
Fast.
And then for round 2.

520
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:11,000
Ground sweeps.

521
00:55:11,244 --> 00:55:15,080
The satellite log shows an
increase in coded traffic recently.

522
00:55:15,168 --> 00:55:17,780
Possibly extra-terrestrial signals.

523
00:55:17,973 --> 00:55:22,217
I bet what we just heard were air-borne
patrols sent to hunt down

524
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:26,146
the remaining signs of life.
Like us.

525
00:55:31,924 --> 00:55:34,848
Okay, oh boy..

526
00:55:34,946 --> 00:55:36,275
That's bad.

527
00:55:41,777 --> 00:55:43,537
And that's worse.

528
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:45,911
What was up there?

529
00:55:46,684 --> 00:55:48,666
Air filtration system.

530
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:53,475
I can't.. something is
blocking the hedge.

531
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:59,466
If we can't get it back up, we're
gonna run out of breathable air fast.

532
00:56:07,897 --> 00:56:09,932
You're the only one
small enough to reach it.

533
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,734
Reach what?

534
00:56:11,777 --> 00:56:14,546
The filtration system.
Through there, the main duct.

535
00:56:14,648 --> 00:56:17,570
Someone needs to get in there
and re-start it.

536
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:22,666
Give me a hand.

537
00:56:23,093 --> 00:56:27,610
- Let me go in, she won't know her way around.
- You won't fit, plus your arm. She'll be fine.

538
00:56:28,337 --> 00:56:34,690
Now, to re-start the unit, you just
swing the handle off and on. Off and on.

539
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:37,457
That should do it.

540
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:43,502
And neither of us will be able
to go in and help you if you get stuck.

541
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:48,840
Don't get stuck.

542
00:57:30,057 --> 00:57:31,133
Michelle?

543
00:57:31,537 --> 00:57:33,582
Everything okay up there?

544
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,819
Looks like a dead end.

545
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,493
That's the incline.

546
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:41,662
Climb up that,
and you're almost there.

547
00:57:44,328 --> 00:57:45,453
Oh, this sucks.

548
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:30,330
'HELP'

549
00:59:57,297 --> 00:59:58,435
What's wrong?

550
01:00:01,822 --> 01:00:03,982
He lied to you, he lied about Megan.

551
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:06,684
What do you mean?

552
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,080
I think he did something horrible to her.

553
01:00:10,906 --> 01:00:12,000
How?.

554
01:00:12,257 --> 01:00:14,791
His family moved to Chicago
years ago.

555
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:18,697
What's this?

556
01:00:21,728 --> 01:00:23,217
Is that blood?

557
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:25,506
Come with me.

558
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:35,506
Wait, is that..

559
01:00:35,786 --> 01:00:38,266
She went missing, two years back.

560
01:00:39,506 --> 01:00:42,560
It was on the news and everything.
Most people just thought she skipped town.

561
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,568
There is a message up there.

562
01:00:47,653 --> 01:00:51,151
It said 'HELP'. It was scratched on the inside of the window.

563
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,991
This earring was with it.

564
01:00:55,106 --> 01:00:57,284
Did she ever show up, after she went missing?

565
01:01:01,466 --> 01:01:05,608
He said to me, he said to my face.
He said this is his daughter, he said this...

566
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,831
He took her and he killed her.

567
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:43,831
I was just thinking,

568
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:45,955
Maybe we

569
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,404
take away his gun

570
01:01:48,631 --> 01:01:52,564
Tie him up, to confess. Whatever it is he's done
- What confess to who, the police?

571
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:55,568
Look, like I said,

572
01:01:56,284 --> 01:01:58,515
We can't be the only survivors, right?

573
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:03,528
- The woman, she was able to get
around a little, right? -- Yeah, till she died.

574
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,542
Directly above us, choking to death.

575
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:08,164
[???]  Other people to save [???]

576
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,690
Now, that's a great example of teamwork.

577
01:02:11,427 --> 01:02:14,362
Very well done.
Feel like some music.

578
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,075
Problem solving always puts me
in a musical mood.

579
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:24,684
Michelle,

580
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:27,066
You should go shower, just in case.

581
01:02:30,217 --> 01:02:31,137
Sure

582
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:56,130
<font color="#808080">[SOUNDTRACK]
The Exciters (Vonda Shepard) - Tell Him (1962)</font>

583
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,151
I think I might have an idea.

584
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:20,217
- '10 Better Ways to Style My Bangs'?
- No, not the article.  This.

585
01:03:20,946 --> 01:03:22,853
I think I can only make one.

586
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,524
But it's a start.

587
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:25,582
No kidding.

588
01:03:33,577 --> 01:03:34,680
Hey, Howard

589
01:03:37,046 --> 01:03:39,047
What is this?
You're re-watching '16 Candles'?

590
01:03:39,146 --> 01:03:40,822
'Pretty in Pink'

591
01:03:41,471 --> 01:03:44,728
It was one of Megan's favorite movies.
Can I help you with something?

592
01:03:45,186 --> 01:03:48,253
No, no, I'm just grabbing some water.

593
01:04:22,555 --> 01:04:23,617
Say, ahmm,

594
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:27,204
You know, I was just thinking..

595
01:04:29,066 --> 01:04:31,524
Not, that I'm trying to tell
you how to run this place.

596
01:04:31,697 --> 01:04:33,355
But I am just,

597
01:04:34,217 --> 01:04:35,604
a bit curious

598
01:04:37,573 --> 01:04:38,800
about Michelle

599
01:04:39,470 --> 01:04:43,164
Say, how close do you think
she got to the air filtration unit?

600
01:04:43,333 --> 01:04:44,742
You think she touched it?

601
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:48,049
Yeah, I'm pretty sure she touched it.

602
01:04:50,075 --> 01:04:54,017
Yeah, I know she cleaned up after, and
everything.. But I'm just thinking..

603
01:04:55,088 --> 01:04:58,146
Given that unit filter has
got god knows what from outside

604
01:04:58,213 --> 01:05:02,791
If she tracked anything back in with
her. It would be pretty concentrated

605
01:05:03,337 --> 01:05:04,060
And

606
01:05:04,208 --> 01:05:08,370
Could be all over the shower,
and the sink, bathroom, right now.

607
01:05:11,970 --> 01:05:13,364
Well, anyways, it's just a thought.

608
01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:45,893
Not bad so far, partner.

609
01:06:46,191 --> 01:06:48,382
If Howard find this, he's going
to kill us.

610
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:54,235
Alright, so, we get the gun away from him,

611
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:57,133
Tie him up, make sure
he isn't going anywhere.

612
01:06:58,640 --> 01:06:59,848
And then one of us

613
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,177
just..

614
01:07:02,484 --> 01:07:04,257
Goes out, and looks for help.

615
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,066
Ahmm, first word..

616
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:23,320
tiny..

617
01:07:24,097 --> 01:07:25,835
Small, pygmie..

618
01:07:26,884 --> 01:07:28,120
- Little.
- Yup.

619
01:07:28,648 --> 01:07:29,910
Alright, ahh

620
01:07:30,066 --> 01:07:31,142
Second word,

621
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:34,631
Michelle, is a..

622
01:07:37,706 --> 01:07:38,591
ahmm, girl

623
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:42,537
hmm, a girl, a child

624
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:48,337
ahh, a girl.

625
01:07:48,693 --> 01:07:51,422
No, she's older, so she is a..

626
01:07:53,630 --> 01:07:54,831
A little princess?

627
01:08:01,546 --> 01:08:02,604
ahh, No.  It was ..

628
01:08:03,324 --> 01:08:04,048
Woman.

629
01:08:04,675 --> 01:08:05,920
'Little Women'..

630
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:08,626
Well,

631
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:09,924
a little woman,

632
01:08:15,195 --> 01:08:16,080
Next time,

633
01:08:16,142 --> 01:08:18,200
Try to be a little more .. specific.

634
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:36,702
I'm always watching

635
01:08:37,977 --> 01:08:38,817
Always.

636
01:08:48,173 --> 01:08:48,990
ahmm, god.

637
01:08:49,826 --> 01:08:51,860
I go wherever I want.

638
01:08:55,271 --> 01:08:56,977
I mean, ah, I don't know.

639
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,537
I know what you're doing,
I see what you're doing.

640
01:09:03,124 --> 01:09:05,648
I know what you're up to.

641
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:09,057
Look, Howard.
I don't know what you're getting at,

642
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:11,191
I see when you're sleeping

643
01:09:11,253 --> 01:09:13,653
- I don't know, what...
- I know what you're doing,

644
01:09:13,706 --> 01:09:18,351
- ahh, I don't know..
- and I'm always watching. Always watching.

645
01:09:21,604 --> 01:09:22,982
Santa Claus.
You're Santa Claus.

646
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:28,262
Yeah, Michelle, that's great.

647
01:09:28,711 --> 01:09:31,008
Okay, except it was Emmett's turn.

648
01:09:31,382 --> 01:09:34,311
- Yeah, I got a little excited...
- well, I'm keeping that point.

649
01:09:35,524 --> 01:09:37,031
Totally, you earned it.

650
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:02,530
Emmett?

651
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:19,113
Hey,

652
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,355
I need your help with something.

653
01:10:25,621 --> 01:10:26,554
Sure.

654
01:10:32,226 --> 01:10:35,035
You.  On deck.

655
01:10:53,849 --> 01:10:54,983
What is this?

656
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:56,777
A barrel.

657
01:11:00,457 --> 01:11:02,226
Move it into the bathroom.

658
01:11:12,475 --> 01:11:14,860
This is sulphoric acid.

659
01:11:16,808 --> 01:11:18,635
Do either of you know what that is?

660
01:11:21,142 --> 01:11:23,013
It's usually produced

661
01:11:23,133 --> 01:11:26,337
as a precursor to
ammonium proclorate.

662
01:11:27,262 --> 01:11:28,440
Fuel.

663
01:11:29,497 --> 01:11:32,450
Used to launch naval cell
like the ones in North Harvard.[???]

664
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:36,257
It's highly corrosive.

665
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:43,395
Dissolves most biological material on contact.

666
01:11:44,128 --> 01:11:45,595
With humans,

667
01:11:45,924 --> 01:11:48,355
Right down to the bone.

668
01:11:51,484 --> 01:11:52,884
Hey, Howard, ahh..

669
01:11:53,328 --> 01:11:55,257
What're you showing it
to us this for?

670
01:11:59,168 --> 01:12:00,724
You think I'm an idiot?

671
01:12:03,377 --> 01:12:06,057
Howard, please, you're going to have to
tell us what you're talking about.

672
01:12:06,111 --> 01:12:08,568
I'm talking about getting rid of some waste.

673
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:14,071
Tell me what you two
were doing with this.

674
01:12:20,315 --> 01:12:22,900
You tell me what you two were planning.
Right now!

675
01:12:22,951 --> 01:12:24,751
Take it easy, Calm down.

676
01:12:24,991 --> 01:12:26,900
- Howard, please.
- I'm giving you one chance.

677
01:12:30,488 --> 01:12:31,968
Howard, just calm down.

678
01:12:32,013 --> 01:12:33,288
One chance!

679
01:12:33,488 --> 01:12:36,133
to answer with some dignity or I swear to god

680
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,622
You're going into this barrel
while you're alive to feel it.

681
01:12:38,657 --> 01:12:39,422
It was me.

682
01:12:43,417 --> 01:12:45,150
Alright, not her, It was just me.

683
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,733
- No, no -- Stay out of this.
She doesn't have a clue

684
01:12:47,786 --> 01:12:48,831
what she's talking about.

685
01:12:49,648 --> 01:12:51,075
I wanted your gun.

686
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:54,466
And so I was,

687
01:12:55,262 --> 01:12:57,413
Thinking about making a weapon

688
01:12:58,470 --> 01:12:59,702
To get it,

689
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:00,786
From you.

690
01:13:08,773 --> 01:13:11,610
I want her to respect me,
the way she respects you.

691
01:13:15,435 --> 01:13:17,320
I'm not saying I was right, okay?

692
01:13:18,875 --> 01:13:20,060
And I'm sorry.

693
01:13:24,853 --> 01:13:27,208
- You're sorry?
- I am sorry.

694
01:13:30,391 --> 01:13:32,115
I accept your apology.

695
01:13:50,355 --> 01:13:52,290
He was going to hurt us.
He was going to hurt you.

696
01:13:52,355 --> 01:13:54,235
It's okay, this is okay.

697
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:56,764
This is the way it was always supposed to be.

698
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:57,930
You're safe now.

699
01:13:57,995 --> 01:13:59,930
Now, it's just you and me.

700
01:14:01,069 --> 01:14:02,270
It's okay.

701
01:14:03,293 --> 01:14:06,000
Now, you should go to your room now.

702
01:14:06,909 --> 01:14:09,610
This is not part of anything
you need to see.

703
01:15:06,591 --> 01:15:07,671
Michelle?

704
01:15:08,551 --> 01:15:09,111
Hey,

705
01:15:11,807 --> 01:15:14,575
I thought we'd change
things up tonight.

706
01:15:14,986 --> 01:15:17,031
And have dessert before dinner.

707
01:15:17,284 --> 01:15:19,822
After all, we can do
whatever we want now.

708
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:28,613
Would you like a cone or a bowl?

709
01:15:32,164 --> 01:15:34,040
Megan always wanted hers a bowl.

710
01:15:34,106 --> 01:15:36,168
the cones are too messy.

711
01:15:38,866 --> 01:15:41,730
I know this is not the life you prefer.

712
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:45,795
And it isn't easy for
you living down here.

713
01:15:46,448 --> 01:15:49,111
But I want us to be a happy family.

714
01:15:49,546 --> 01:15:50,622
You and me.

715
01:15:53,910 --> 01:15:55,973
The mess is all taken care of.

716
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:00,266
So, just hang loose, and
I'll go get dinner started.

717
01:17:05,897 --> 01:17:07,311
Everything alright?

718
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:10,350
Yeah, I was just about to do some reading.

719
01:17:15,711 --> 01:17:17,404
It's time to set the table.

720
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:19,951
Supper is ready.

721
01:17:22,582 --> 01:17:24,995
- Yeah.
- Okay.

722
01:17:37,066 --> 01:17:38,850
Keeps doing that.
I don't know why.

723
01:17:52,173 --> 01:17:54,813
Michelle,
Why is this loose?

724
01:17:59,253 --> 01:18:00,270
Get up.

725
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,533
- Why?
- Get up.

726
01:18:02,728 --> 01:18:04,453
Get off the matress.
Now!

727
01:18:09,955 --> 01:18:10,862
Oh, shit.

728
01:18:35,088 --> 01:18:36,688
You're going to walk out on me?

729
01:18:39,831 --> 01:18:41,310
After I saved you?

730
01:18:41,466 --> 01:18:43,026
And kept you safe?

731
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:44,785
This is how you re-pay me?

732
01:18:46,608 --> 01:18:47,480
No

733
01:18:49,155 --> 01:18:50,333
This is.

734
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:32,126
Michelle!

735
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,942
You don't know what's out there.

736
01:21:00,244 --> 01:21:02,950
You can't run from them.

737
01:21:04,226 --> 01:21:05,893
Stay with me.

738
01:26:44,111 --> 01:26:45,460
Come on.

739
01:29:52,982 --> 01:29:55,420
Help!  I'm out here, help!

740
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:11,106
Oh, fuck.

741
01:34:33,262 --> 01:34:37,026

<i>Or combat experience</i>

742
01:34:37,333 --> 01:34:39,115

743

749
