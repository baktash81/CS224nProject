00:00:22,436 --> 00:00:25,303
# Sylvia... #

2
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:31,736
# Sylvia... #

3
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:39,545
# Sylvia #

4
00:00:39,586 --> 00:00:42,111
# Smile for me #

5
00:00:42,155 --> 00:00:47,525
# Fill my world
with poetry #

6
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:53,625
# Forget those
faraway dreams #

7
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:59,003
# That haunt you #

8
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,304
# Sylvia #

9
00:01:03,343 --> 00:01:06,608
# Young in years #

10
00:01:06,646 --> 00:01:09,809
# Let the sunshine #

11
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,616
# Dry your tears #

12
00:01:13,653 --> 00:01:18,556
# And we
will walk in the wind #

13
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:22,995
# And stars #

14
00:01:23,029 --> 00:01:28,990
# Like April lovers #

15
00:01:29,035 --> 00:01:35,463
# With hearts aglow... #

16
00:01:40,947 --> 00:01:43,745
Come on back
to bed, Sylvia.

17
00:01:43,784 --> 00:01:46,446
Can't you see
I'm cooking scrapple?

18
00:01:46,486 --> 00:01:50,047
It can wait.
Sex is in the air.

19
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,026
Not in here it isn't.
I got work, Vaughn.

20
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,051
Your mother
is up the store.

21
00:01:56,096 --> 00:01:59,361
It's light out, for Christ's sake.
What's gotten into you?

22
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,300
Come on, move!

23
00:02:03,804 --> 00:02:08,434
#... Forget those
faraway dreams #

24
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:14,209
# That haunt you... #

25
00:02:18,185 --> 00:02:21,484
God!

26
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:24,922
#... Let the sunshine #

27
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,085
# Dry your tears #

28
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:34,567
# And we will walk
in the wind... #

29
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:37,593
Damn it!

30
00:02:39,339 --> 00:02:42,502
Jesus Christ.
Oh-hh!

31
00:02:44,511 --> 00:02:50,677
#... With hearts aglow #

32
00:02:50,717 --> 00:02:52,685
# Till love discloses #

33
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,588
# Where the secret
roses grow... #

34
00:02:57,624 --> 00:02:59,592
You seen my keys?

35
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:02,026
Ow!

36
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:07,692
I said, have you seen
my keys?

37
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:09,702
Where did you
leave them?

38
00:03:09,736 --> 00:03:12,933
If I knew where I'd left them, they
wouldn't be lost, would they?

39
00:03:12,973 --> 00:03:15,771
Vaughnhole!

40
00:03:19,746 --> 00:03:23,876
Oh, Jesus Christ Almighty!

41
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:25,578
It's not my fault.

42
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:28,679
Somebody left his magazine on the front
porch and it got me all riled up.

43
00:03:28,722 --> 00:03:31,816
Oh, sure,
"somebody left it."

44
00:03:31,858 --> 00:03:33,553
sure, sure...

45
00:03:33,593 --> 00:03:35,060
You said
you didn't want to.

46
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:38,064
I mean a man has needs, Sylvia.
Marital needs.

47
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:41,590
# My gal is red hot, yeah! #

48
00:03:41,735 --> 00:03:43,965
# My gal is red hot #

49
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:45,972
# Your gal ain't
doodly squat #

50
00:03:46,006 --> 00:03:47,974
# Well, she ain't got
no money, but man #

51
00:03:48,008 --> 00:03:51,239
# She's really
got a lot #

52
00:03:51,278 --> 00:03:54,372
# Well, I got a gal,
six feet four... #

53
00:03:54,414 --> 00:03:57,076
Ooh.

54
00:03:57,117 --> 00:03:59,085
#... My gal is red hot #

55
00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:00,711
# Your gal
ain't doodly squat #

56
00:04:00,754 --> 00:04:04,349
# Yeah, my gal
is red hot #

57
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:06,188
# Your gal
ain't doodly squat #

58
00:04:06,226 --> 00:04:08,456
# Well, she ain't got
no money, but, man... #

59
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:11,760
Isn't it a little early
for that, Caprice?

60
00:04:11,798 --> 00:04:14,323
I'm developing
my act, Mother.

61
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:17,734
Mutilating your mammaries
and gyrating down at some biker bar

62
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:20,467
is an act, all right,
an act of defiance.

63
00:04:20,507 --> 00:04:23,670
I was a legend down at the Holiday
House, in case you didn't know it.

64
00:04:25,645 --> 00:04:27,613
Morning, honey.

65
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:30,980
Daddy, let me go down to the bar
and perform.

66
00:04:31,017 --> 00:04:32,882
You're in home detention,
cupcake.

67
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:35,615
The "government" wants you to stay
indoors for a while, huh?

68
00:04:35,655 --> 00:04:37,486
You're just too pretty
to go out.

69
00:04:37,524 --> 00:04:41,961
We let you keep your tawdry theatrical
mementoes. Isn't that enough?

70
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:46,295
You were convicted
of indecent exposure for the third time.

71
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,460
I was promoting
the art of dance.

72
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:50,332
With nude loitering?!

73
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:54,363
Nude and disorderly conduct?
Nude drunken driving?

74
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:58,605
I was not drunk.
I was on pills.

75
00:04:58,645 --> 00:05:01,375
Something is the matter
with you, Caprice.

76
00:05:01,414 --> 00:05:04,440
You are such a Neuter,
Mother.

77
00:05:04,484 --> 00:05:06,645
And Neuters will never
understand.

78
00:05:06,686 --> 00:05:09,416
Something is the matter
with your vagina.

79
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:14,723
Hu.

80
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,219
Morning,
Mrs. Stickles.

81
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:23,357
Oh, you brat!
I'm gonna report you.

82
00:05:23,403 --> 00:05:26,065
Morning.
Formstone's looking good.

83
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:28,370
Ah, it's the real McCoy
all right, vintage.

84
00:05:28,408 --> 00:05:30,103
- Paid through the nose for it.
- Oh.

85
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:33,374
One thing we've learned... proper
restoration never comes cheaply.

86
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:36,814
I need to go down to
the bar... just for an hour!

87
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,081
Come on, Dad, don't lock it.
Daddy, let me go!

88
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,021
My public needs me!

89
00:05:43,056 --> 00:05:45,183
- Ooh!
- Mrs. Stickles,

90
00:05:45,225 --> 00:05:47,557
my name is Fat Fuck Frank.

91
00:05:47,594 --> 00:05:50,358
And I'm your daughter's
number one fan.

92
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:53,025
She moved to
the Erie Canal area.

93
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:54,829
Hey, Vaughn.

94
00:05:54,868 --> 00:05:56,859
Hey!

95
00:05:56,903 --> 00:05:58,871
Caprice retired
from show business.

96
00:05:58,905 --> 00:06:00,668
She's no longer
a public figure.

97
00:06:00,707 --> 00:06:04,336
Her name ain't Caprice,
it's "Ursula Udders." And she's famous.

98
00:06:04,377 --> 00:06:06,675
She got the biggest tits
on Harford Road.

99
00:06:06,713 --> 00:06:10,114
Ursula! Ursula Udders!

100
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,210
Texture, that's
what I call it.

101
00:06:13,253 --> 00:06:14,948
It's me,
Fat Fuck Frank.

102
00:06:14,988 --> 00:06:17,422
And I miss
them great big...

103
00:06:19,192 --> 00:06:21,888
Destroy all Neuters!

104
00:06:21,928 --> 00:06:24,453
We sure didn't
have this in D.C.

105
00:06:24,497 --> 00:06:28,126
God, I love Baltimore.
It's a real city of diversity.

106
00:06:28,168 --> 00:06:32,400
Sylvia! Sylvia,
we need gas, honey!

107
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:35,431
Get gas.

108
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:37,943
Honey,
still mad?

109
00:06:37,977 --> 00:06:42,107
Remember to fill it up.
I'll walk, don't worry.

110
00:06:48,154 --> 00:06:49,519
Hmm?

111
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:57,956
Ugh!

112
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:03,697
# Smokey the bear,
Smokey the bear #

113
00:07:03,737 --> 00:07:06,331
- # Prowling and a-growling... #
- Grr!

114
00:07:06,372 --> 00:07:08,306
Hi! Grrr-rr! Woof!

115
00:07:08,341 --> 00:07:11,868
- Grrr!
- Woof! Woof!

116
00:07:11,911 --> 00:07:15,278
# That's why they called him Smokey,
that is how he got his name... #

117
00:07:18,651 --> 00:07:22,246
- Hi, Vaughn.
- Morning, Betty.

118
00:07:22,288 --> 00:07:25,189
Does the Pinewood
Park-and-Pay sell lotions?

119
00:07:25,225 --> 00:07:27,853
You know...
ointments?

120
00:07:27,894 --> 00:07:29,862
We sure do.

121
00:07:31,664 --> 00:07:35,156
How is that fine wife
of yours doing?

122
00:07:35,201 --> 00:07:38,102
She's up at the store
like always, Wendell.

123
00:07:38,138 --> 00:07:40,402
Don't you
find it funny

124
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:45,503
that every man
in this neighborhood has a penis?

125
00:07:45,545 --> 00:07:47,274
Well, not really,
Betty.

126
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:01,658
Sheeze...!

127
00:08:02,662 --> 00:08:04,459
U!

128
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,669
Oh, don't.

129
00:08:19,712 --> 00:08:21,703
Jesus, Mary,
and Joseph!

130
00:08:21,748 --> 00:08:23,375
O!

131
00:08:23,516 --> 00:08:25,541
#... Whoa, whoa-whoa #

132
00:08:25,585 --> 00:08:28,884
# I need your loving... #
oh, that's it, babe.

133
00:08:28,922 --> 00:08:31,356
That's it, oh-oh-oh.

134
00:08:31,391 --> 00:08:33,416
Oh, God!

135
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:37,924
Ooh, that's it, baby.

136
00:08:37,964 --> 00:08:41,422
Oh, talk to the mike,
talk to the mike. Ooh-ooh.

137
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:49,498
Oh, that's what
I call a hum job. Oh, yeah.

138
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:55,907
Come on.

139
00:08:55,949 --> 00:08:58,679
Oh, okay.

140
00:08:58,718 --> 00:09:01,118
I'm out of gas.

141
00:09:01,154 --> 00:09:02,849
Move it, Neuter!

142
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:06,222
- Oh, God!
- How am I supposed to move with no gas?

143
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,455
Get out of the way!
We're in a hurry.

144
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,630
# Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa! #

145
00:09:19,806 --> 00:09:23,105
- Filthy little hedges.
- Morning, Marge.

146
00:09:23,142 --> 00:09:25,042
Growin' all dirty,
makes me sick.

147
00:09:32,385 --> 00:09:35,252
Hi, I'm "Mama Bear."

148
00:09:35,288 --> 00:09:37,347
have you met
my hus-bear?

149
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,914
No, I haven't.

150
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,926
I'm "Papa Bear."

151
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,396
And this is our cub,
"Baby Bear."

152
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,829
Grrr!

153
00:09:45,865 --> 00:09:49,631
I'm Vaughn. Welcome
to the Harford Road area.

154
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:52,137
When we take over,
it's gonna be a...

155
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:54,662
"Bearquake!"

156
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:57,736
#... Happy, happy, happy #

157
00:09:57,777 --> 00:10:00,940
# With a big bear hug. #

158
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,380
- Come on.
- Move that piece of shit.

159
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,940
Can you call
Triple-A, please?

160
00:10:10,456 --> 00:10:12,287
Hurry up,
I've got a hot date.

161
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:14,293
What, at 7:00 a.m.?
What's the matter with you?

162
00:10:14,327 --> 00:10:16,761
You'd have a date too
if you wore some make-up.

163
00:10:16,796 --> 00:10:19,162
- Your poor husband.
- Huh?

164
00:10:27,006 --> 00:10:28,701
Ooh-hh!

165
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:30,299
If you could just
help me, I'd...

166
00:10:30,343 --> 00:10:31,640
Ooh!

167
00:10:34,948 --> 00:10:37,416
It's her!

168
00:10:39,986 --> 00:10:43,717
Let's go sexing.

169
00:10:51,397 --> 00:10:53,991
# Sylvia... #

170
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,346
O!

171
00:11:19,525 --> 00:11:20,856
Ooh!

172
00:11:24,063 --> 00:11:26,224
Hello, ma'am.

173
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:29,723
My name is Ray Ray
and I'm here to... service you.

174
00:11:31,571 --> 00:11:35,701
I'm Sylvia,
and I hit my head. Oh.

175
00:11:38,044 --> 00:11:42,310
A concussion
is a terrible thing

176
00:11:42,348 --> 00:11:45,010
to waste.
It's okay.

177
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:47,417
Ooh!

178
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:49,887
My pussy's on fire.

179
00:11:49,922 --> 00:11:52,550
I know it is.
It's a burning bush.

180
00:11:52,592 --> 00:11:54,924
Show me a sign, Sylvia.

181
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:56,895
We knew you'd come.

182
00:11:56,929 --> 00:11:59,864
All I can do
is pass the gift.

183
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:01,423
Huh?

184
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:05,631
You're a sex addict now
and you'll never be the same.

185
00:12:16,349 --> 00:12:18,874
Ooh-aah...!

186
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,993
There you go.

187
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,089
All better?

188
00:12:33,132 --> 00:12:36,590
Oh, thank you so much.

189
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:39,127
I don't know
what came over me.

190
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:42,664
Well, you recognized the concussion
and there's no going back now.

191
00:12:44,477 --> 00:12:47,071
I'm gonna give you
my card.

192
00:12:49,148 --> 00:12:51,412
Sex addicts
are everywhere, Sylvia,

193
00:12:51,451 --> 00:12:53,976
and pretty soon,
Harford Road will be ours.

194
00:12:56,689 --> 00:12:59,180
Oh, hey, hold on.

195
00:13:17,443 --> 00:13:20,173
Ray Ray
is a sexual healer.

196
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:24,206
Come visit us,
Sylvia.

197
00:13:25,218 --> 00:13:27,243
Your people
are waiting.

198
00:13:27,286 --> 00:13:29,481
O.

199
00:13:29,522 --> 00:13:33,288
One day we're going
to discover a brand new sex act,

200
00:13:33,326 --> 00:13:35,487
one that's never
been performed before.

201
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:39,396
And we hope you'll be
with us on that day of carnal rapture.

202
00:13:52,345 --> 00:13:54,006
Ooo.

203
00:13:55,381 --> 00:13:57,315
A.

204
00:14:21,474 --> 00:14:23,499
# Pussy, ooh... #

205
00:14:23,543 --> 00:14:27,206
# Sore, wet, ooh... #

206
00:14:34,754 --> 00:14:37,279
# My pussycat was scratching out
on my back door... #

207
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,450
#... Scratched so long
poor pussy got sore #

208
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:44,588
# Sore pussy, ooh... #

209
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:48,623
# Sore... pussy... ooh #

210
00:14:48,668 --> 00:14:51,330
# Just a friendly
little cat #

211
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,429
# Friendly little cat #

212
00:14:53,472 --> 00:14:57,738
# My pussycat
was sitting out on the front step #

213
00:14:57,777 --> 00:15:02,111
# Sat so long poor pussy got wet,
sore pussy. #

214
00:15:03,282 --> 00:15:06,046
Hello, Mrs. Stickles.

215
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,554
Oh boy, am I blushing?

216
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,718
Everyone is familiar with
the traditional forms of pornography.

217
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:15,556
But the Internet
is creating new forms...

218
00:15:15,595 --> 00:15:18,257
- You going to the movies, Dave?
- Huh?

219
00:15:18,297 --> 00:15:20,265
Hell, you're picking
your seat, aren't you?

220
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,570
Dykes!

221
00:15:26,606 --> 00:15:29,370
Used to be Harford Road
was for families.

222
00:15:29,408 --> 00:15:31,399
Now it's
a lesbian aorta.

223
00:15:31,444 --> 00:15:35,107
Mother,
I don't feel well.

224
00:15:35,147 --> 00:15:37,081
Well, no wonder,

225
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:40,108
they've got blatant homosexuals
shopping right in our store.

226
00:15:40,152 --> 00:15:42,484
They eat life,
you know.

227
00:15:42,521 --> 00:15:45,115
- Jesus!
- Sperm!

228
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:55,633
Did you see those
new neighbors moving in?

229
00:15:55,668 --> 00:15:59,263
Hmm? Grown men with
hairy legs prancing around half naked...

230
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:03,002
"We're bears." what the hell is that
supposed to mean?

231
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:05,010
Free country,
Big Ethel.

232
00:16:05,044 --> 00:16:07,911
Yeah well, we got laws
to protect decency.

233
00:16:07,947 --> 00:16:09,915
And it would
be nice

234
00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:12,417
if somebody enforced them.
19, 20.

235
00:16:12,451 --> 00:16:14,578
Well, as my mother
used to say...

236
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,112
"'Each to their own,' said the old lady
as she kissed the cow."

237
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,633
Perverts are taking over
this neighborhood.

238
00:16:32,471 --> 00:16:35,565
Ugh! Mr. Mailman,
as of next week,

239
00:16:35,608 --> 00:16:37,542
we're not carrying
the girlie magazines no more.

240
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:39,544
That's a shame.

241
00:16:39,578 --> 00:16:43,446
Makes me sick to see government
employees looking at that filth, Marge.

242
00:16:43,482 --> 00:16:47,111
And on taxpayers' time yet.
That's why the mail's late.

243
00:16:47,153 --> 00:16:50,213
Yeah, and the post office has the nerve
to raise the price of a stamp.

244
00:16:50,256 --> 00:16:53,191
While mailmen are
beating off everywhere.

245
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:57,821
I found a used condom
in my back yard.

246
00:16:57,863 --> 00:16:59,694
You think that's bad?

247
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:01,529
Somebody wrote
the word "boner"

248
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:03,330
on our parking lot wall
last night.

249
00:17:03,369 --> 00:17:05,735
We've got to do something,
Marge.

250
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:12,102
People have got to know
how bad things are getting.

251
00:17:12,144 --> 00:17:14,169
No wonder I've got
to take heart pills.

252
00:17:14,213 --> 00:17:15,703
I read in the paper
the other day

253
00:17:15,748 --> 00:17:19,115
that the average married couple has sex
over 100 times a year.

254
00:17:19,151 --> 00:17:22,882
That's a lie.
People would be raw if that was true.

255
00:17:22,922 --> 00:17:26,551
I'll be at your meeting all right,
with bells on.

256
00:17:26,592 --> 00:17:29,186
You have, uh, AAA batteries?

257
00:17:29,228 --> 00:17:31,321
I certainly do.

258
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,694
You sure these
are the right ones?

259
00:17:36,736 --> 00:17:39,899
You want me
to take them out?

260
00:17:39,939 --> 00:17:42,373
No, no, I guess I'll buy them.

261
00:17:42,408 --> 00:17:45,343
Well, get down there,
mutha, and start scarfing.

262
00:17:45,378 --> 00:17:47,471
What the hell?

263
00:17:47,513 --> 00:17:52,075
I mean, Jesus...
for Christ's sake! I'm moving to Towson.

264
00:17:52,118 --> 00:17:54,609
Harford Road...
where life is cheap.

265
00:17:54,653 --> 00:17:57,816
- Only you can prevent fornication.
- Yeah, yeah.

266
00:17:57,857 --> 00:18:00,690
You see, Marge?
People in the neighborhood have had it.

267
00:18:00,726 --> 00:18:02,489
It wasn't this bad
in the '60s.

268
00:18:02,528 --> 00:18:04,018
You're right.

269
00:18:04,063 --> 00:18:07,692
Someone left a dildo
in my neighbor's wishing well,

270
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:10,031
right on her
front lawn.

271
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:12,264
People are just ignorant
everywhere.

272
00:18:13,506 --> 00:18:15,599
Morning, Big Ethel.

273
00:18:15,641 --> 00:18:17,905
Uh, what's good about a morning
with dildos in it?

274
00:18:17,943 --> 00:18:22,437
Amen to that.
My husband's on Viagra.

275
00:18:22,481 --> 00:18:25,143
- Oh, you poor thing!
- Every minute, he wants it.

276
00:18:25,184 --> 00:18:27,152
He has no right
to be that hard.

277
00:18:27,186 --> 00:18:30,280
I'm Viagra-vated
and I'm not gonna take it anymore.

278
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:44,035
Sylvia!

279
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:46,037
Feeling better,
huh?

280
00:18:51,677 --> 00:18:53,645
Mail here
for Ursula Udders.

281
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,011
Her name is Caprice
and she's got shingles.

282
00:18:56,048 --> 00:18:59,540
Our daughter doesn't really participate
in the mail these days.

283
00:18:59,585 --> 00:19:03,112
I'll take the fan mail to her, Warren.
Don't you worry.

284
00:19:03,155 --> 00:19:06,283
You should be ashamed of yourself,
Mr. Mailman.

285
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:08,316
Ashamed of what,
Big Ethel?

286
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:15,594
- Damn, I could deliver that one.
- Oh, keep it up.

287
00:19:15,634 --> 00:19:19,502
I'm gonna call the Postmaster general...
If he's not whacking off...

288
00:19:19,538 --> 00:19:21,597
and report
your potty mouth.

289
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,939
Sex addicts
are everywhere, Sylvia.

290
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:26,968
You wanna
have funch?

291
00:19:27,012 --> 00:19:28,980
What's "funch,"
honey?

292
00:19:29,014 --> 00:19:32,450
Fucking
after lunch.

293
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:35,318
Funch, huh?

294
00:19:35,354 --> 00:19:38,653
Come on.
This must be my lucky day.

295
00:19:38,691 --> 00:19:41,592
- Hmm, spaghetti...
- Yeah, she'll ring it up for you.

296
00:19:41,627 --> 00:19:43,857
Where do you two
think you're going?

297
00:19:43,896 --> 00:19:45,864
It's not safe out.

298
00:19:45,898 --> 00:19:48,128
People are shaving
their crotches as we speak.

299
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:50,795
There's pubic hair
in the air everywhere.

300
00:19:50,836 --> 00:19:52,497
We're having
a decency rally,

301
00:19:52,538 --> 00:19:54,904
and I think you two
need to be there.

302
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,237
Yeah.

303
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,221
# I've got hot nuts #

304
00:20:11,257 --> 00:20:13,054
# 10 cents a bag... #

305
00:20:13,092 --> 00:20:15,959
- What kind of station is that?
- A good one.

306
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:18,589
#... l've got hot nuts... #

307
00:20:18,631 --> 00:20:20,963
- Feeling frisky, eh?
- Uh-huh.

308
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,525
Let's open one of Caprice's
fan letters.

309
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:25,537
That's her
personal mail.

310
00:20:25,571 --> 00:20:28,506
Oh, look...

311
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:33,103
it's from the mailman. He sent Caprice
a photo of his penis. Ooh!

312
00:20:33,145 --> 00:20:35,113
He what?

313
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:38,082
Are you kidding me?
Give me the picture.

314
00:20:38,117 --> 00:20:42,019
Give me the picture. Give me the pic...
I'm not kidding around.

315
00:20:42,054 --> 00:20:44,386
This is disgusting.

316
00:20:44,423 --> 00:20:46,118
Well, he's got
a big one.

317
00:20:46,158 --> 00:20:48,126
What kind of talk
is that?

318
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,355
Oh, they're all photos
of the mailman's unit.

319
00:20:50,396 --> 00:20:52,387
I'm calling
the cops.

320
00:20:52,431 --> 00:20:55,264
Yes, sir,
a real arse-opener!

321
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:56,632
Stop it, Sylvia.

322
00:20:56,669 --> 00:20:59,695
Pink steel!

323
00:20:59,738 --> 00:21:01,035
What's the matter
with you?

324
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:04,372
Hey, Vaughn,
feel like "yodeling in the canyon"?

325
00:21:05,945 --> 00:21:07,913
We have to visit
my mother, remember?

326
00:21:07,947 --> 00:21:10,677
Oh, come on,
you wanted to earlier.

327
00:21:10,716 --> 00:21:12,707
Well, not that,
I didn't.

328
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:16,209
Come on, Vaughn,
discover the oyster.

329
00:21:16,255 --> 00:21:18,746
Honey, this is Pinewood Avenue.
We live here.

330
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,759
Can't we wait
till we get back to the house?

331
00:21:20,793 --> 00:21:22,852
Oh, go "way down
South in Dixie."

332
00:21:22,895 --> 00:21:25,295
All right, all right,
just keep a look out.

333
00:21:25,331 --> 00:21:27,822
Okay.

334
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:33,934
Oh-hh!

335
00:21:33,973 --> 00:21:35,270
No...!

336
00:21:35,307 --> 00:21:37,332
Oh!

337
00:21:37,376 --> 00:21:40,971
Now that's what I call
"sneezing in the cabbage."

338
00:21:43,215 --> 00:21:44,705
O!

339
00:21:45,851 --> 00:21:49,787
Harford Road,
let's all band together.

340
00:21:49,822 --> 00:21:53,622
Horndogs are everywhere.
Pretty soon they'll be living next door.

341
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:58,119
Decency, that's all
I'm asking for. Decency!

342
00:22:04,837 --> 00:22:07,101
Decency's fine.

343
00:22:07,139 --> 00:22:09,801
But diversity in a neighborhood
is a good thing too.

344
00:22:09,842 --> 00:22:13,073
This isn't diversity,
it's depravity.

345
00:22:13,112 --> 00:22:15,706
On my way over here,
I saw a man

346
00:22:15,748 --> 00:22:18,012
performing oral sex
on a lady

347
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:20,780
in a car
in broad daylight.

348
00:22:22,254 --> 00:22:24,245
Lesbians have taken over
the softball fields.

349
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:26,951
So? Lesbians are
good neighbors.

350
00:22:26,992 --> 00:22:29,620
We need to start by teaching tolerance
in our own homes.

351
00:22:29,662 --> 00:22:33,223
Some guy was playing with himself
near me in the movies.

352
00:22:33,265 --> 00:22:36,701
You're saying that's normal?
His crotch was shaved!

353
00:22:38,404 --> 00:22:40,668
These are isolated
incidents.

354
00:22:40,706 --> 00:22:42,674
No, they're not.

355
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:45,575
Look, I'm not a prude.
I'm married to an Italian.

356
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:47,909
But I am disgusted.

357
00:22:47,946 --> 00:22:50,608
I live near what they call
"The Bear House."

358
00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:52,844
Last night,

359
00:22:52,885 --> 00:22:56,184
hairy, overweight men
who call themselves bears

360
00:22:56,221 --> 00:22:58,849
were having sex
outside the house.

361
00:22:58,891 --> 00:23:00,791
My children heard them.

362
00:23:00,826 --> 00:23:03,954
"Mommy, what's that noise?"
They actually asked me.

363
00:23:03,996 --> 00:23:06,396
I raced outside
clapping my hands loudly

364
00:23:06,432 --> 00:23:09,526
and I yelled...
"No blow jobs!"

365
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,536
And they just laughed.

366
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:15,199
Some of them
even growled at me.

367
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,538
Oh, no!

368
00:23:17,576 --> 00:23:19,635
Today, somebody
called me a Neuter.

369
00:23:19,678 --> 00:23:21,942
And you know what?
I didn't mind.

370
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,540
If neuter means "normal,"
I'll say it loud...

371
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:27,245
I am Marge, the Neuter,
and I'm proud.

372
00:23:27,286 --> 00:23:28,981
That's right!

373
00:23:33,258 --> 00:23:35,556
We're all Neuters!

374
00:23:35,594 --> 00:23:39,155
And we'll never,
never be not normal!

375
00:23:43,335 --> 00:23:46,702
# You put your left foot in,
you put your left foot out #

376
00:23:46,739 --> 00:23:49,469
# You put your left foot in #

377
00:23:49,508 --> 00:23:51,100
# And you shake it
all about #

378
00:23:51,143 --> 00:23:54,601
# You do the Hokey-Pokey
and you turn yourself around #

379
00:23:54,646 --> 00:23:57,877
- # That's what it's all about #
- # Right arm! #

380
00:23:57,916 --> 00:24:01,511
# You put your right arm in,
you put your right arm out #

381
00:24:01,553 --> 00:24:05,182
# You put your right arm in
and then you shake it all about... #

382
00:24:10,963 --> 00:24:12,760
# Left arm! #

383
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:16,825
# You put your left arm in,
you put your left arm out #

384
00:24:16,869 --> 00:24:20,999
# You put your left arm in
and then you shake it all about #

385
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,099
# You do the Hokey-Pokey
and you turn yourself around #

386
00:24:24,143 --> 00:24:26,043
# That's what
it's all about #

387
00:24:26,078 --> 00:24:27,909
# Right elbow! #

388
00:24:27,946 --> 00:24:31,882
# You put your right elbow in,
you put your right elbow out #

389
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:35,444
# You put your right elbow in
and you shake it all about #

390
00:24:35,487 --> 00:24:37,751
# You do
the Hokey-Pokey... #

391
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,951
Hi!

392
00:24:39,992 --> 00:24:43,155
- # That's what it's all about... #
- Hey, Mom.

393
00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:46,722
# You put your left elbow in,
you put your left elbow out... #

394
00:24:46,765 --> 00:24:50,724
- Come on, let's dance.
- # And then you shake it all about... #

395
00:24:56,975 --> 00:24:58,465
# Head! #

396
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:02,071
# You put your head in,
you put your head out #

397
00:25:02,114 --> 00:25:05,811
# You put your head in
and you shake it all about #

398
00:25:05,851 --> 00:25:09,947
# You do the Hokey-Pokey
and you turn yourself around #

399
00:25:09,988 --> 00:25:12,286
# That's what
it's all about #

400
00:25:12,324 --> 00:25:14,053
# Right hip! #

401
00:25:14,092 --> 00:25:17,118
# You put your right hip in,
you put your right hip out #

402
00:25:17,162 --> 00:25:20,689
# You put your right hip in
and you shake it all about #

403
00:25:20,732 --> 00:25:25,226
# You do the Hokey-Pokey
and you turn yourself around #

404
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,170
# That's what
it's all about #

405
00:25:27,206 --> 00:25:28,764
# Left hip! #

406
00:25:28,807 --> 00:25:32,334
# You put your left hip in,
you put your left hip out #

407
00:25:32,377 --> 00:25:36,211
# You put your left hip in
and you shake it all about... #

408
00:25:42,721 --> 00:25:44,382
# Whole self! #

409
00:25:44,423 --> 00:25:47,654
# You put your whole self in,
you put your whole self out #

410
00:25:47,693 --> 00:25:51,356
# You put your whole self in
and you shake it all about #

411
00:25:51,396 --> 00:25:54,957
# You do the Hokey-Pokey
and you turn yourself around #

412
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,662
# That's what it's
all about #

413
00:25:57,703 --> 00:25:59,295
# Backside! #

414
00:25:59,338 --> 00:26:02,671
# You put your backside in,
you put your backside out #

415
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:07,042
# You put your backside in
and you shake it all about

416
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:09,946
# You do the Hokey-Pokey
and you turn yourself around... #

417
00:26:14,152 --> 00:26:16,347
Ooh!

418
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:21,421
# You do the Hokey-Pokey #

419
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:24,657
# You do the Hokey-Pokey... #

420
00:26:24,696 --> 00:26:27,961
# That's what it's all about. #

421
00:26:34,706 --> 00:26:36,901
Sylvia!

422
00:28:21,847 --> 00:28:24,179
Oh!

423
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:44,225
Oh! Oh!

424
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,775
Taxi! Taxi!

425
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:10,060
Ray Ray's service center,
6630 Harford Road.

426
00:29:10,095 --> 00:29:11,357
Yes, ma'am.

427
00:29:16,735 --> 00:29:18,396
Uhh.

428
00:29:20,172 --> 00:29:23,505
Hey, lady, you can't
change your clothes in here.

429
00:29:23,542 --> 00:29:26,340
- Why not?
- 'Cause I said so.

430
00:29:27,946 --> 00:29:29,777
Want some fun?

431
00:29:29,815 --> 00:29:32,807
What are you doing?

432
00:29:37,222 --> 00:29:39,315
- Can I get up front?
- No, you can't.

433
00:29:39,357 --> 00:29:42,884
- You can leave the meter running.
- Stay in the back.

434
00:29:42,928 --> 00:29:46,887
- Oh, come on, I want some action.
- Get off me, lady.

435
00:29:46,932 --> 00:29:50,265
Hey... you can't do
that stuff in here.

436
00:29:50,302 --> 00:29:53,271
- Get out!
- This cab free?

437
00:29:53,305 --> 00:29:55,398
Sure is, tiger.

438
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,069
Hey, hey, hey!
Jeez!

439
00:29:59,111 --> 00:30:02,706
Go! What the hell
was that?

440
00:30:05,117 --> 00:30:06,948
Oh.

441
00:30:10,489 --> 00:30:13,049
- # Mommy told me something... #
- Traitor!

442
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:15,059
That's right,
spread the word.

443
00:30:15,093 --> 00:30:17,823
You bet, Big Ethel.

444
00:30:17,863 --> 00:30:21,026
Here, put the pink ones
on the cars.

445
00:30:21,066 --> 00:30:22,863
Put the yellows
on the houses.

446
00:30:22,901 --> 00:30:25,529
Put that
on the windshield.

447
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,334
And don't stop till you get to the end
of the block.

448
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:35,871
# He will never
ever leave you if your heart... #

449
00:30:35,914 --> 00:30:38,940
- Who is it?
- It's Big Ethel.

450
00:30:40,352 --> 00:30:42,650
We're having
a decency rally...

451
00:30:42,687 --> 00:30:44,848
You better start
in your own backyard then.

452
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:47,484
I heard your daughter Sylvia
picked up a bottle

453
00:30:47,526 --> 00:30:49,721
with her cooter
in the old folks' home.

454
00:30:49,761 --> 00:30:52,696
She what?
That's not true.

455
00:30:52,731 --> 00:30:55,598
My daughter is a good girl.
She hates sex.

456
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,731
What is she talking about,
that bitch?

457
00:31:26,298 --> 00:31:29,096
Hello?

458
00:31:32,103 --> 00:31:34,628
Ray Ray?

459
00:31:36,141 --> 00:31:40,009
It's me, Sylvia.
And I need full service.

460
00:31:40,045 --> 00:31:42,605
I knew you'd find us,
Sylvia.

461
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:49,384
Don't be afraid. We've all had
accidental concussions just like you.

462
00:31:49,421 --> 00:31:51,981
- You have?
- Yeah.

463
00:31:52,023 --> 00:31:54,924
Mine was from the faulty hood
of a customer's car

464
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,793
that collapsed on my head
while I was changing the oil.

465
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,636
And now I guide other
head-injury sufferers

466
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:08,366
to the final dawn
of sexual awakening.

467
00:32:08,406 --> 00:32:11,739
- You've been sent to help us.
- I have?

468
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:15,576
We're all sex addicts
and we have been waiting for you.

469
00:32:15,614 --> 00:32:18,276
- But why?
- Because you can lead us

470
00:32:18,316 --> 00:32:22,912
to an erotic orgasm
we've never experienced.

471
00:32:22,954 --> 00:32:24,785
I can't.
I promise you I can't.

472
00:32:24,823 --> 00:32:26,586
I'm Loose Linda.

473
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:30,755
I fucked the entire
Harford Road Police Department.

474
00:32:30,795 --> 00:32:32,786
It's nice to meet you,
Loose Linda.

475
00:32:34,899 --> 00:32:36,867
Until you've hit your head,

476
00:32:36,901 --> 00:32:40,064
you can never really feel
the power you get from sex.

477
00:32:40,105 --> 00:32:42,665
My name is Paw Paw.
I'm on "bush patrol."

478
00:32:42,707 --> 00:32:44,675
I hope we can
have sex one day.

479
00:32:44,709 --> 00:32:47,143
I'd like that, Sylvia.

480
00:32:50,215 --> 00:32:53,844
I knew you'd come.
You're number 12.

481
00:32:53,885 --> 00:32:56,513
- Number 12 what?
- All in good time.

482
00:33:04,462 --> 00:33:06,430
Dave, is that you?

483
00:33:06,464 --> 00:33:09,627
We call him Dingy Dave
and he's number three.

484
00:33:09,668 --> 00:33:12,967
Don't worry, Mrs. Stickles,
you'll understand soon.

485
00:33:13,004 --> 00:33:16,132
Dingy Dave is lucky.
He's into mysophilia.

486
00:33:16,174 --> 00:33:19,666
It's a sexual attraction to dirt.
He thought it was new.

487
00:33:19,711 --> 00:33:21,679
But it wasn't.

488
00:33:21,713 --> 00:33:25,046
Dirt worship's been around long
before my accident.

489
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:27,813
I just didn't know.

490
00:33:27,852 --> 00:33:29,945
Ray Ray

491
00:33:29,988 --> 00:33:33,617
has helped me understand
my hypersexuality.

492
00:33:33,658 --> 00:33:37,355
And he cured me
of my herpes.

493
00:33:37,395 --> 00:33:39,625
Like a miracle.

494
00:33:39,664 --> 00:33:41,632
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no.

495
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:44,066
We don't say the "m" word
around here.

496
00:33:44,102 --> 00:33:48,038
- Oh.
- Mrs. Stickles?

497
00:33:48,073 --> 00:33:51,065
May I, uh, be
your vacuum cleaner?

498
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:54,875
Well, I'm new to this,
but I'll try.

499
00:34:00,118 --> 00:34:03,246
Oh!

500
00:34:03,288 --> 00:34:06,086
Oh!

501
00:34:08,026 --> 00:34:09,891
It's like Noah's ark
around here.

502
00:34:09,928 --> 00:34:12,692
There is one
of every perversion.

503
00:34:12,731 --> 00:34:16,997
But, alas, it's all
been done.

504
00:34:17,035 --> 00:34:19,128
Brace yourself, Sylvia.

505
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:21,468
Got company!

506
00:34:21,506 --> 00:34:23,440
Officer Alvin!

507
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:29,209
I'm an adult baby, Sylvia.
You want to be my mommy?

508
00:34:29,247 --> 00:34:31,306
Adult babies are into
age regression.

509
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:34,045
They intensely eroticize
being infants.

510
00:34:34,085 --> 00:34:36,383
And sometimes they like
to be burped.

511
00:34:36,421 --> 00:34:40,187
I'm a big boy and
I'm beyond the law.

512
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,228
# Bouncy, bouncy,
bouncy... #

513
00:34:44,262 --> 00:34:46,287
As you grow to embrace
your concussion,

514
00:34:46,331 --> 00:34:48,299
you'll learn to accept
anything sexual

515
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:51,097
as long as it's safe,
consensual and doesn't harm others.

516
00:34:51,136 --> 00:34:53,866
You wanna powder
my chafed butt?

517
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:55,566
Uh, I would,

518
00:34:55,607 --> 00:34:58,940
but I'm supposed
to help Ray Ray think up a new sex act.

519
00:34:58,977 --> 00:35:00,604
Maybe later.

520
00:35:00,645 --> 00:35:03,307
Da-da...

521
00:35:04,516 --> 00:35:06,643
Number five,
six and seven.

522
00:35:06,684 --> 00:35:09,084
You may know us
as neighbors, Sylvia,

523
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,021
but in this world,
we're into human sandwiches.

524
00:35:13,725 --> 00:35:16,922
One day, we hope
you'll be our "lettuce."

525
00:35:19,264 --> 00:35:22,392
- You know about my Priority Penis.
- Oof! Ow!

526
00:35:22,434 --> 00:35:24,402
I never thought
it would be you.

527
00:35:24,436 --> 00:35:27,064
Come on and meet
the "Three Bears."

528
00:35:30,575 --> 00:35:34,033
We're husky, we're hairy,
we're homosexual

529
00:35:34,078 --> 00:35:36,069
and out of
the second closet.

530
00:35:36,114 --> 00:35:39,083
And we can cuddle
all night.

531
00:35:39,117 --> 00:35:42,712
Yeah, hunting for some grizz-sm...

532
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,460
Ever hear
of sploshing?

533
00:35:51,496 --> 00:35:54,158
I only had my concussion
this morning.

534
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:56,258
It's okay.
It's an English fetish.

535
00:35:56,301 --> 00:35:58,428
Sploshing is
the erotic urge

536
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,529
to dump food
in your private area.

537
00:36:02,173 --> 00:36:05,939
Oh-ooh!

538
00:36:05,977 --> 00:36:08,172
I'm Messy Melinda

539
00:36:08,213 --> 00:36:10,340
and our bushes
will burn together.

540
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:14,317
And of course you know
of Fat Fuck Frank.

541
00:36:14,352 --> 00:36:16,912
Mrs. Stickles, go home
and free your daughter.

542
00:36:20,091 --> 00:36:23,151
She's one of us
and needs to be here now.

543
00:36:27,465 --> 00:36:31,333
I'm number 11.

544
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:33,735
Number 11?

545
00:36:42,714 --> 00:36:46,445
Oh, my God!
I'm the 12th apostle?

546
00:36:46,484 --> 00:36:48,008
- Yes, shh.
- Say it proud.

547
00:36:48,052 --> 00:36:50,680
If you say it out loud,
you might disappear.

548
00:36:50,722 --> 00:36:52,587
No, no, no, I'm just
Sylvia Stickles.

549
00:36:52,624 --> 00:36:55,252
I'm a horny woman
with a head injury. I can...

550
00:36:55,293 --> 00:36:58,854
I know you are and we're
gonna do something about that.

551
00:36:59,998 --> 00:37:02,796
Ray Ray
is a sex saint,

552
00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:06,395
- and he's got powers.
- Amen to that.

553
00:37:15,246 --> 00:37:17,771
I've got a hard-on
of gold,

554
00:37:17,815 --> 00:37:21,216
and my tongue
is on fire.

555
00:37:22,554 --> 00:37:24,954
Oh, and I've got
hot pants, Ray Ray.

556
00:37:24,989 --> 00:37:27,822
We're all in heat.

557
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:30,726
And as you know, Sylvia
is a cunnilingus bottom.

558
00:37:30,762 --> 00:37:31,854
Yes, she is.

559
00:37:31,896 --> 00:37:33,761
Who wants
to eat her out?

560
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:39,035
Let's go sexing!

561
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:41,402
Yeah!

562
00:37:43,608 --> 00:37:46,577
Jesus Christ,
how many houses do I gotta go to?

563
00:37:46,611 --> 00:37:49,307
Who is it?

564
00:37:49,347 --> 00:37:51,872
It's Big Ethel
from up the Park-and-Pay.

565
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:53,884
We're having
a decency rally tomorrow.

566
00:37:53,918 --> 00:37:56,443
We want all Neuters
to be there.

567
00:37:57,689 --> 00:37:59,657
What's a Neuter?

568
00:37:59,691 --> 00:38:02,558
It's a normal person who
is fed up with perversion.

569
00:38:02,594 --> 00:38:03,720
Sign me up then.

570
00:38:03,761 --> 00:38:06,821
Tonight a woman in my cab
tried to grab my nutsack.

571
00:38:06,864 --> 00:38:09,389
Oh, it's a sick world!

572
00:38:11,703 --> 00:38:13,330
# I don't know how it started
I don't know what I did #

573
00:38:13,371 --> 00:38:15,532
# I don't know how it started
i don't know what I did #

574
00:38:15,573 --> 00:38:18,736
# But there's a gal who's chasing me
who really flipped her lid #

575
00:38:18,776 --> 00:38:21,540
- Hey!
- # I call her my eager beaver baby #

576
00:38:21,579 --> 00:38:24,104
# Ooh, eager beaver
baby... #

577
00:38:24,148 --> 00:38:26,343
- Was that Sylvia Stickles?
- I think it was.

578
00:38:26,384 --> 00:38:28,011
What happened
to her?

579
00:38:28,052 --> 00:38:31,920
I don't know, but
it's a dirty shame.

580
00:38:35,026 --> 00:38:37,392
#... Well what am I
gonna do #

581
00:38:37,428 --> 00:38:42,161
# With that eager beaver
baby of mine? #

582
00:38:44,602 --> 00:38:46,365
Hello, Vaughn.

583
00:38:47,772 --> 00:38:50,536
Hello, Betty.
Have you seen my wife?

584
00:38:50,575 --> 00:38:52,475
Come on in.

585
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:56,469
No, I can't.
Sylvia seems to be missing.

586
00:38:56,514 --> 00:38:58,675
I was with her
earlier, but...

587
00:38:58,716 --> 00:39:01,116
Maybe she's
getting lucky.

588
00:39:01,152 --> 00:39:04,519
Harford Road
is wild these days.

589
00:39:18,269 --> 00:39:21,170
Hey, hey, come on,
open.

590
00:40:07,552 --> 00:40:10,282
I seen you,
Sylvia Stickles,

591
00:40:10,321 --> 00:40:13,654
showing your pubic patch
to the bus driver.

592
00:40:13,691 --> 00:40:16,592
You should move downtown
where you belong, you whore.

593
00:40:19,897 --> 00:40:22,297
End of the line.

594
00:40:34,011 --> 00:40:36,912
Okay, buster,
turn off the motor.

595
00:40:36,948 --> 00:40:40,349
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you!

596
00:40:41,853 --> 00:40:45,687
Yes, Ma'am!

597
00:40:48,326 --> 00:40:51,693
# Don't touch that spot
that itchy-twitchy spot #

598
00:40:51,729 --> 00:40:54,789
# That spot that's swelling up
and turning red... #

599
00:40:54,832 --> 00:40:57,596
- Grrr...
- What are you doing in there?

600
00:40:57,635 --> 00:40:59,068
Vaughn, where is
my daughter?

601
00:40:59,103 --> 00:41:01,037
I don't know, Big Ethel.
I can't find her.

602
00:41:01,072 --> 00:41:03,734
Oh, don't go in there.
Bears live here.

603
00:41:03,775 --> 00:41:06,903
Big fat hairy fags
with dicks.

604
00:41:09,647 --> 00:41:11,842
Hi, I'm Cow Patty.

605
00:41:11,883 --> 00:41:14,443
I'm Vaughn.
I live up the street

606
00:41:14,485 --> 00:41:15,975
and I'm looking
for my wife Sylvia.

607
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:19,956
I'm the only "Goldilocks" allowed
in this bear cave.

608
00:41:19,991 --> 00:41:22,585
I'm a bear hag.
And we call this...

609
00:41:22,627 --> 00:41:25,095
Bear soup!

610
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,097
Wow, a tranny bear.

611
00:41:33,137 --> 00:41:35,628
Come on in.

612
00:41:35,673 --> 00:41:37,937
Police!

613
00:42:11,909 --> 00:42:13,900
# My gal is red hot #

614
00:42:13,945 --> 00:42:15,913
# Your gal
ain't doodly squat #

615
00:42:15,947 --> 00:42:18,575
# Yeah,
my gal is red hot #

616
00:42:18,616 --> 00:42:21,278
- # Your gal ain't doodly squat... #
- Go, baby, go!

617
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:22,752
Shake that thing!

618
00:42:22,787 --> 00:42:24,982
#... she's really
got a lot... #

619
00:42:25,022 --> 00:42:27,889
Mother!
What's the matter?

620
00:42:27,925 --> 00:42:29,916
#... Six feet four... #

621
00:42:29,961 --> 00:42:32,725
Nothing, honey.
I just wanted to have

622
00:42:32,763 --> 00:42:34,560
a little
mother-daughter chat.

623
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:37,397
I'm so sorry
I spoke so harshly

624
00:42:37,435 --> 00:42:39,460
about your vagina
this morning.

625
00:42:39,503 --> 00:42:43,234
It's all right.
Where did you get that outfit, Mother?

626
00:42:43,274 --> 00:42:47,005
Oh, you like it?
It's my new apostle look.

627
00:42:47,044 --> 00:42:49,911
Oh, you've got fan mail.

628
00:42:52,016 --> 00:42:54,814
The mailman's
got a big johnson, doesn't he?

629
00:42:54,852 --> 00:42:56,945
Mother!

630
00:42:56,988 --> 00:42:59,286
Well, your father's
got a big one too.

631
00:42:59,323 --> 00:43:01,450
Oh, you are
freaking me out.

632
00:43:01,492 --> 00:43:03,460
I was with Fat Fuck Frank
this afternoon.

633
00:43:03,494 --> 00:43:05,587
He seems to really
like your tits.

634
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:08,394
Is he hung?

635
00:43:08,432 --> 00:43:10,525
He's about
average.

636
00:43:10,568 --> 00:43:13,036
Tell me, Ursula...

637
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:16,039
'cause that's the name
you like to use, isn't it?

638
00:43:16,073 --> 00:43:17,267
Yes it is, Mother.

639
00:43:17,308 --> 00:43:21,210
I know that Fat Fuck Frank
is a tit man,

640
00:43:21,245 --> 00:43:25,682
but does he ever...
well, you know...

641
00:43:25,716 --> 00:43:27,377
"whistle
in the dark"?

642
00:43:27,418 --> 00:43:31,821
Yes, he does.
Thank you for asking.

643
00:43:34,025 --> 00:43:37,654
Oh, my God!
You have met Ray Ray.

644
00:43:37,695 --> 00:43:40,892
Oh, Mother!

645
00:43:42,733 --> 00:43:44,894
# Goo-goo, da-da #

646
00:43:44,936 --> 00:43:47,097
# Goo-goo, da-da #

647
00:43:47,138 --> 00:43:50,972
Officer, it's not like my wife
to just walk away.

648
00:43:51,008 --> 00:43:54,466
She was probably
kidnapped by sex fiends.

649
00:43:54,512 --> 00:43:58,004
We've got orgies going on,
perverts walking around.

650
00:43:58,049 --> 00:44:01,450
- Do something.
- I am doing something.

651
00:44:01,485 --> 00:44:03,544
# Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy #

652
00:44:03,587 --> 00:44:05,418
# Hmm, bouncy... #

653
00:44:05,456 --> 00:44:07,424
Goo-goo,
Goo-goo, ma-ma!

654
00:44:09,894 --> 00:44:13,455
- This isn't California.
- It's Harford Road.

655
00:44:13,497 --> 00:44:16,898
Baby just shaved his balls.
You wanna see 'em?

656
00:44:16,934 --> 00:44:18,333
Oh!

657
00:44:39,623 --> 00:44:42,558
I'm a sex addict,

658
00:44:42,593 --> 00:44:44,857
an exhibitionist,

659
00:44:44,895 --> 00:44:47,056
and I'm
your daughter.

660
00:44:47,098 --> 00:44:51,000
Oh, oh, Ursula...

661
00:44:51,035 --> 00:44:52,832
ever since
my concussion,

662
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:56,533
I've learned so much
about eros.

663
00:44:56,574 --> 00:44:59,099
I'm a sex addict too.

664
00:44:59,143 --> 00:45:02,044
I'm a cunnilingus
bottom,

665
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,944
and I'm
your mother.

666
00:45:03,981 --> 00:45:07,815
I tried to tell you about my maypole
accident when I was 11.

667
00:45:09,153 --> 00:45:12,714
But you never listened.

668
00:45:12,757 --> 00:45:17,285
Oh, I'm so sorry. I'll make it up
to you, Ursula, I promise.

669
00:45:18,829 --> 00:45:21,195
Let's go down
to the Holiday House

670
00:45:21,232 --> 00:45:24,258
and fuck the whole bar.

671
00:45:24,301 --> 00:45:26,633
Okay, Mom.

672
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:30,231
Let's go sexing!

673
00:45:43,387 --> 00:45:45,878
Ooh-ooh!

674
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,526
- Come on!
- I am coming as fast as I can.

675
00:46:06,944 --> 00:46:10,846
# Well, I was drivin'
down l-95 the other night #

676
00:46:10,881 --> 00:46:14,544
# Somebody nearly cut me
right off the road #

677
00:46:14,585 --> 00:46:17,952
# I decided it wasn't
gonna do any good to get mad #

678
00:46:17,988 --> 00:46:21,287
# So I wrote a song
about him instead #

679
00:46:21,325 --> 00:46:23,919
# It goes like this... #

680
00:46:23,961 --> 00:46:27,658
# Were you born
an asshole? #

681
00:46:27,698 --> 00:46:32,260
# Or did you work at it
your whole life? #

682
00:46:32,303 --> 00:46:36,399
# Either way
it's worked out fine #

683
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:39,773
# 'Cause you're
an asshole tonight... #

684
00:46:52,857 --> 00:46:54,347
Ha! Ha! Ha!

685
00:46:56,927 --> 00:46:59,828
Ursula! Ursula! Ursula!

686
00:46:59,864 --> 00:47:02,731
Ursula!
Ursula! Ursula!

687
00:47:02,766 --> 00:47:04,791
Ursula! Ursula! Ursula!

688
00:47:04,835 --> 00:47:06,928
# My gal is red hot #

689
00:47:06,971 --> 00:47:09,371
# Your gal
ain't doodly squat #

690
00:47:09,406 --> 00:47:12,239
# Yeah, my gal is red hot #

691
00:47:12,276 --> 00:47:14,244
# Your gal
ain't doodly squat #

692
00:47:14,278 --> 00:47:16,143
# Well, she ain't got
no money #

693
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,080
# But man, she's really
got a lot #

694
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:22,619
# Well, I got a gal,
six feet four #

695
00:47:22,653 --> 00:47:25,554
# Sleeps in the kitchen
with her feet out the door #

696
00:47:25,589 --> 00:47:27,557
# My gal is red hot #

697
00:47:27,591 --> 00:47:29,582
# Your gal
ain't doodly squat #

698
00:47:29,627 --> 00:47:32,528
# Yeah, my gal
is red hot #

699
00:47:32,563 --> 00:47:34,724
# Your gal
ain't doodly squat #

700
00:47:34,765 --> 00:47:36,494
# Well, she ain't got
no money #

701
00:47:36,534 --> 00:47:38,263
# But man, she's
really got a lot... #

702
00:47:42,773 --> 00:47:44,764
Wait up, Vaughn.

703
00:47:44,808 --> 00:47:47,368
Come on, Big Ethel.

704
00:47:48,646 --> 00:47:50,341
Oh, my God.

705
00:47:50,381 --> 00:47:53,475
- Vaughn, I need my pills.
- I know.

706
00:47:55,753 --> 00:47:59,553
#... Well, she walks
all night, talks all day... #

707
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:01,683
That's my daughter.

708
00:48:01,725 --> 00:48:03,420
That's my daughter!

709
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,519
That's my
daughter!

710
00:48:05,563 --> 00:48:09,795
#... Yeah, my gal
is red hot... #

711
00:48:09,833 --> 00:48:11,926
Caprice!

712
00:48:12,937 --> 00:48:14,598
Capri...

713
00:48:16,607 --> 00:48:19,974
Hi. Hey, come on.
Come on.

714
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,544
Ooh-hh!

715
00:48:33,657 --> 00:48:36,922
# Well, she's the kinda
woman who's a lounge-around #

716
00:48:36,961 --> 00:48:39,725
# Spendin' my business
all over town #

717
00:48:39,763 --> 00:48:42,391
# But my gal is red hot #

718
00:48:42,433 --> 00:48:44,731
# Your gal
ain't doodly squat... #

719
00:48:44,768 --> 00:48:47,362
Aah! Let me go!

720
00:48:47,404 --> 00:48:49,497
Oh, Big Ethel!

721
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,201
Get off my ass!

722
00:48:53,611 --> 00:48:55,602
Ooh.

723
00:48:58,582 --> 00:49:00,311
Sylvia!

724
00:49:00,351 --> 00:49:01,875
Shoot!

725
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:06,012
# Sylvia... #

726
00:49:06,056 --> 00:49:07,785
# Sylvia... #

727
00:49:07,825 --> 00:49:09,793
# Z-Y-X #

728
00:49:09,827 --> 00:49:11,988
# And W-V-U #

729
00:49:12,029 --> 00:49:13,326
# T-S-R-Q #

730
00:49:13,364 --> 00:49:15,696
# P-O-N-M-L-K #

731
00:49:15,733 --> 00:49:17,325
# J-l-H #

732
00:49:17,368 --> 00:49:19,598
# G-F-E-D-C-B-A #

733
00:49:19,637 --> 00:49:22,663
# We say
the backward alphabet #

734
00:49:22,706 --> 00:49:24,799
# It's complex #

735
00:49:24,842 --> 00:49:26,571
# And trouble
to learn too #

736
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:30,068
# But you can do it
if you put your mind to it #

737
00:49:30,114 --> 00:49:31,911
# That's the way... #

738
00:49:31,949 --> 00:49:34,042
# Now everybody say it #

739
00:49:34,084 --> 00:49:35,915
# You can do
the backwards alphabet #

740
00:49:35,953 --> 00:49:37,443
# Z-Y-X... #

741
00:49:37,488 --> 00:49:39,649
# You can learn
the backwards alphabet #

742
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:41,851
# S-R-Q-P... #

743
00:49:41,892 --> 00:49:43,655
# You can learn
the backwards alphabet... #

744
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:01,535
- Sylvia?
- Hmm?

745
00:50:01,578 --> 00:50:04,479
You have what is known
as a "runaway vagina."

746
00:50:04,515 --> 00:50:07,143
- I do?
- You had a concussion, honey.

747
00:50:07,184 --> 00:50:10,085
Sometimes a booboo
on the head

748
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,054
can trigger inappropriate
sexual outbursts.

749
00:50:12,089 --> 00:50:15,923
- You're a sex addict, Sylvia.
- And you've hit bottom.

750
00:50:15,959 --> 00:50:17,893
Don't listen
to them, Mother.

751
00:50:17,928 --> 00:50:20,328
Sexual addiction is a privilege.
You know that.

752
00:50:20,364 --> 00:50:22,958
Do you know how embarrassing
this is for me?

753
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,401
One nymphomaniac
in the family's bad enough, but two?!

754
00:50:26,437 --> 00:50:28,871
It's a disease,
Big Ethel.

755
00:50:28,906 --> 00:50:32,273
Being a whore
is a disease?

756
00:50:33,777 --> 00:50:37,008
Caprice, because of your
criminally enlarged breasts...

757
00:50:37,047 --> 00:50:38,412
You're a freak.

758
00:50:38,449 --> 00:50:41,043
The bloodstream to your brain
has been blocked,

759
00:50:41,085 --> 00:50:43,645
causing
permanent depression.

760
00:50:43,687 --> 00:50:47,088
I'm not depressed.
Daddy!

761
00:50:47,124 --> 00:50:50,116
- You should be depressed.
- No, I don't want Prozac!

762
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,754
- No...
- These will make you feel normal.

763
00:50:52,796 --> 00:50:55,492
I don't want to feel normal!
Mother, help me.

764
00:50:55,532 --> 00:50:58,695
Caprice, I apologize
for my shameful behavior.

765
00:50:58,736 --> 00:51:00,704
Don't you recognize
the concussion?

766
00:51:00,738 --> 00:51:03,468
Just swallow.

767
00:51:03,507 --> 00:51:05,475
prozac can lower
the libido

768
00:51:05,509 --> 00:51:08,376
and stymie the sexual fantasies
of many female patients.

769
00:51:08,412 --> 00:51:11,074
And then finally, finally we can
schedule you

770
00:51:11,115 --> 00:51:12,776
for a breast reduction operation.

771
00:51:12,816 --> 00:51:15,444
No! I don't
want to be Neuter.

772
00:51:15,486 --> 00:51:18,717
Maybe she's right.
Sex addicts are everywhere.

773
00:51:18,756 --> 00:51:21,384
And soon they're gonna
discover a new sex act.

774
00:51:21,425 --> 00:51:23,188
I'm supposed
to help them.

775
00:51:23,227 --> 00:51:24,922
It will pass, Sylvia.

776
00:51:24,962 --> 00:51:27,624
No, there's this guy
named Ray Ray

777
00:51:27,664 --> 00:51:31,122
and he is their leader
and he ate me out.

778
00:51:31,168 --> 00:51:33,500
Ugh!

779
00:51:35,005 --> 00:51:37,371
You let strangers put
their germ-filled mouths on your uterus?

780
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:41,910
Sylvia, Dr. Arlington told me
about these meetings.

781
00:51:41,945 --> 00:51:44,436
Yeah, they're
for people like you.

782
00:51:44,481 --> 00:51:48,247
Honey, the whole family
is gonna go, Sylvia.

783
00:51:48,285 --> 00:51:50,981
But we're not
telling anybody.

784
00:51:52,289 --> 00:51:54,587
# Sylvia... #

785
00:51:59,663 --> 00:52:01,722
I've got a hard-on
of gold,

786
00:52:01,765 --> 00:52:05,462
and my tongue
is on fire.

787
00:52:05,502 --> 00:52:07,527
Let's go sexing...?

788
00:52:11,241 --> 00:52:14,733
Sylvia, stay
on this side.

789
00:52:17,014 --> 00:52:19,574
You had a concussion,
honey.

790
00:52:24,755 --> 00:52:26,484
Mmph.

791
00:52:28,025 --> 00:52:32,359
No, Caprice, you know
it doesn't work that way.

792
00:52:32,396 --> 00:52:34,796
It has to be
an accident.

793
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:48,410
Oh, please,
I beg of you.

794
00:52:48,445 --> 00:52:51,710
Help me to keep
my sexual sobriety.

795
00:52:51,748 --> 00:52:53,045
Please.

796
00:53:14,004 --> 00:53:15,995
Ho-ho-ho!

797
00:53:17,574 --> 00:53:19,474
# Do you like boobs a lot?
Yes, I like boobs a lot #

798
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:21,671
# Boobs a lot, boobs a lot,
you gotta like boobs a lot #

799
00:53:21,712 --> 00:53:23,805
# Really like boobs a lot,
you gotta like boobs a lot #

800
00:53:23,847 --> 00:53:26,008
# Boobs a lot, boobs a lot,
you gotta like boobs a lot #

801
00:53:26,049 --> 00:53:28,142
# Down in the locker room,
just we boys #

802
00:53:28,185 --> 00:53:30,119
# Beating down the locker room
with all that noise #

803
00:53:30,153 --> 00:53:32,314
# Singing "Do you like boobs a lot?"
you gotta like boobs a lot... #

804
00:53:32,356 --> 00:53:34,517
# Boobs a lot, boobs a lot...
you like boobs a lot #

805
00:53:34,558 --> 00:53:35,582
# Do you wear
your jock a lot? #

806
00:53:38,428 --> 00:53:40,589
Oh...!

807
00:53:42,432 --> 00:53:46,129
# If I forget
to say my prayers #

808
00:53:46,169 --> 00:53:48,865
# The devil
jumps with glee #

809
00:53:48,906 --> 00:53:52,433
# That he feels
so awful-awful #

810
00:53:52,476 --> 00:53:55,934
# When he sees me
on my knees #

811
00:53:55,979 --> 00:53:59,471
# So if you're
full of trouble #

812
00:53:59,516 --> 00:54:02,952
# And you never seem
to win #

813
00:54:02,986 --> 00:54:06,149
# Just open up
your heart #

814
00:54:06,189 --> 00:54:09,886
# And let the sun
shine in #

815
00:54:09,927 --> 00:54:13,886
# So let the sun
shine in #

816
00:54:13,931 --> 00:54:17,128
# Face it with a grin #

817
00:54:17,167 --> 00:54:20,000
# Open up your heart #

818
00:54:20,037 --> 00:54:23,598
# And let the sun
shine in. #

819
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,767
Sex.

820
00:54:25,809 --> 00:54:27,777
My name is Paige,

821
00:54:27,811 --> 00:54:30,473
I'm from Roxton
and I am a sex addict.

822
00:54:30,514 --> 00:54:33,483
My drug of choice...
frottage,

823
00:54:33,517 --> 00:54:36,884
the sexual rubbing-up
on unsuspecting citizens.

824
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,787
"Excuse me," I'd say,
while I'd grind my crotch

825
00:54:39,823 --> 00:54:43,122
into an unsuspecting passenger
on a crowded airplane.

826
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,628
Halt, hungry, angry,

827
00:54:45,662 --> 00:54:47,653
lonely, tired.

828
00:54:47,698 --> 00:54:50,667
No one ever knew.
I was in first class...

829
00:54:50,701 --> 00:54:53,261
Hello, I'm Ronnie the Rimmer
and I'm a sex addict.

830
00:54:53,303 --> 00:54:54,736
Uh. Uh!

831
00:54:55,806 --> 00:54:59,799
I'm Sylvia and
my clitoris is in crisis.

832
00:54:59,843 --> 00:55:01,777
I'm Sylvia's
husband Vaughn,

833
00:55:01,812 --> 00:55:04,872
and... I'm trying
to understand.

834
00:55:04,915 --> 00:55:06,883
And this is my daughter,
Caprice.

835
00:55:06,917 --> 00:55:09,750
Yeah, and Prozac
saved my life.

836
00:55:09,786 --> 00:55:14,519
I'm Big Ethel and don't get any ideas,
I'm normal.

837
00:55:14,558 --> 00:55:17,789
Hello, I'm Tony the Tickler
and I was a tickle top.

838
00:55:17,828 --> 00:55:19,853
And that's nothing
to laugh at.

839
00:55:19,896 --> 00:55:24,333
We are the Stickles family
and it's nice to be here.

840
00:55:24,368 --> 00:55:27,269
Excuse me, I'd say
for the hundredth time...

841
00:55:27,304 --> 00:55:29,738
this is Lu Ann
and Larry.

842
00:55:29,773 --> 00:55:31,798
We were into
"Roman showers."

843
00:55:31,842 --> 00:55:33,969
Vomiting on each other
as foreplay.

844
00:55:34,011 --> 00:55:35,603
But that doesn't
come up anymore.

845
00:55:35,646 --> 00:55:37,978
No, siree,
a higher power saved us.

846
00:55:38,015 --> 00:55:39,983
I want these
people arrested

847
00:55:40,017 --> 00:55:42,042
and punished
to the full extent of the law.

848
00:55:42,085 --> 00:55:44,178
Let me lead you
to recovery.

849
00:55:45,789 --> 00:55:48,815
Once, a man on jury duty
complained that I rode his knee

850
00:55:48,859 --> 00:55:50,724
when we filed in
to announce the verdict.

851
00:55:50,761 --> 00:55:52,820
But I denied it
to the judge.

852
00:55:52,863 --> 00:55:55,388
Sex addicts
learn to lie.

853
00:55:55,432 --> 00:55:59,732
Denial... don't need you
to know that I am lying.

854
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:02,568
They call me Dora.

855
00:56:02,606 --> 00:56:05,973
And I'm a chronic
masturbator.

856
00:56:06,009 --> 00:56:09,001
I've been sober
only two weeks now.

857
00:56:09,046 --> 00:56:12,345
I'm Sylvia
and I've hit bottom.

858
00:56:12,382 --> 00:56:15,146
...day in and day out.

859
00:56:15,185 --> 00:56:18,348
Finally someone reported me
to a security guard and I was arrested.

860
00:56:18,388 --> 00:56:23,087
- I would hope so.
- We don't judge others here, madam.

861
00:56:23,126 --> 00:56:25,356
Progress, not perfection.

862
00:56:25,395 --> 00:56:29,092
Sex addicts,
your meetings are my life.

863
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,195
Thank you.

864
00:56:32,235 --> 00:56:33,998
Thank you so much.

865
00:56:34,037 --> 00:56:36,835
Halt, hungry, angry,

866
00:56:36,873 --> 00:56:38,898
lonely, tired...

867
00:56:38,942 --> 00:56:42,605
All this yelling is giving me
a "Swedish headache."

868
00:56:42,646 --> 00:56:47,140
you know what I mean?
Horny.

869
00:56:47,184 --> 00:56:49,175
This woman is crazy.

870
00:56:49,219 --> 00:56:51,847
Nothing's the matter with "beating
the beaver" once in a while.

871
00:56:53,123 --> 00:56:56,684
Hello, I'm Paige
and I am a sex addict.

872
00:56:56,727 --> 00:56:59,252
I'm Sylvia
and I can't control

873
00:56:59,296 --> 00:57:01,958
my..."axis of evil."

874
00:57:01,998 --> 00:57:04,091
let me be your sponsor,
Sylvia.

875
00:57:04,134 --> 00:57:07,069
Thank you.
I'm so ashamed.

876
00:57:07,104 --> 00:57:11,598
- Admit to God... you are a whore.
- I'm a whore.

877
00:57:11,641 --> 00:57:13,632
Make a list of all
the people you've fucked

878
00:57:13,677 --> 00:57:15,975
and apologize
to their parents.

879
00:57:16,012 --> 00:57:18,810
My name
is Mr. Pay Day.

880
00:57:18,849 --> 00:57:21,943
- And I'm here for a little scat chat.
- Thank you.

881
00:57:21,985 --> 00:57:26,422
A pay day is an unflushed turd,
hence my name.

882
00:57:28,492 --> 00:57:30,460
I used to defecate
in public restrooms

883
00:57:30,494 --> 00:57:32,689
up and down Harford Road

884
00:57:32,729 --> 00:57:35,664
- and never flush the toilet.
- That was him?

885
00:57:35,699 --> 00:57:39,135
But my life of turd abuse
didn't stop there, oh no.

886
00:57:39,169 --> 00:57:42,468
I started doing
"upper deckers"...

887
00:57:42,506 --> 00:57:44,804
shitting in the top tank
of the toilet,

888
00:57:44,841 --> 00:57:46,900
where no one would ever look
to find the odor.

889
00:57:46,943 --> 00:57:49,434
I can certainly
judge that.

890
00:57:49,479 --> 00:57:52,607
- Progress, not perfection.
- Thank you.

891
00:57:52,649 --> 00:57:54,640
Thank you,
it really means a lot.

892
00:57:54,684 --> 00:57:58,916
Hi, my name is Caprice

893
00:57:58,955 --> 00:58:01,685
and I am a sex addict.

894
00:58:04,161 --> 00:58:06,322
I used to be known
as Ursula Udders,

895
00:58:06,363 --> 00:58:11,027
but let me tell you,
Ursula Udders is utterly over.

896
00:58:11,067 --> 00:58:15,663
I'm on Prozac now
and I am a new woman.

897
00:58:15,705 --> 00:58:18,037
Oh.

898
00:58:18,074 --> 00:58:21,134
Halt, hungry, angry...

899
00:58:21,178 --> 00:58:24,443
Ever jerk off when one
of your hands is asleep?

900
00:58:24,481 --> 00:58:27,541
No. Look, please,
I'm a Neuter.

901
00:58:27,584 --> 00:58:29,552
You should try it.

902
00:58:29,586 --> 00:58:33,317
It feels like
somebody else is doing it.

903
00:58:33,356 --> 00:58:35,449
I defied nature
and now I must pay the price.

904
00:58:35,492 --> 00:58:38,461
- Ever take a "rufie"?
- No!

905
00:58:38,495 --> 00:58:41,589
Me neither.
I'm afraid I'd stay home

906
00:58:41,631 --> 00:58:44,225
and date rape myself
all night long.

907
00:58:44,267 --> 00:58:48,328
...that I will get
a breast reduction operation.

908
00:58:48,371 --> 00:58:50,498
Yes. I will.

909
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:54,203
- I promise.
- Yes! Yes!

910
00:58:54,244 --> 00:58:56,974
And I will never

911
00:58:57,013 --> 00:59:00,380
be nude again!

912
00:59:00,417 --> 00:59:04,114
Thank you.
Thank you.

913
00:59:04,154 --> 00:59:06,714
I got my girls.

914
00:59:08,325 --> 00:59:12,159
Er... er...
my name is Sylvia,

915
00:59:12,195 --> 00:59:16,222
And I too
am a sex addict.

916
00:59:16,266 --> 00:59:19,292
But I'm not dirty
anymore.

917
00:59:20,303 --> 00:59:22,032
Grrr-rr...

918
00:59:22,072 --> 00:59:25,530
That's right, Sylvia. You know how long
your poor dead father had to wait?

919
00:59:25,575 --> 00:59:29,136
It was a long hard road
to this vagina.

920
00:59:30,714 --> 00:59:35,048
We must warn others
in the concussion community,

921
00:59:35,085 --> 00:59:39,522
that a head injury
is not an excuse for debauchery.

922
00:59:41,558 --> 00:59:43,549
That's right, sister!

923
00:59:45,061 --> 00:59:48,224
But your vagina
belongs to eternity, Sylvia Stickles.

924
00:59:49,766 --> 00:59:51,734
be gone,
Beelzebub.

925
00:59:51,768 --> 00:59:54,566
Let my mother's
pussy be!

926
00:59:54,604 --> 00:59:56,697
I'm not your
filthy apostle.

927
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:58,867
No, sir, no!

928
00:59:58,909 --> 01:00:01,571
I'm not
number anything.

929
01:00:01,611 --> 01:00:06,275
He is a fraud. Remember Jim Jones?
Remember People's Temple?

930
01:00:06,316 --> 01:00:10,548
He's a sex addict. A filthy controlling
pervert who wants your soul.

931
01:00:10,587 --> 01:00:14,353
It's all mumbo-jumbo.
He's just a filthy man.

932
01:00:14,391 --> 01:00:16,882
Sex addicts,
you are the chosen people.

933
01:00:16,927 --> 01:00:18,758
Help us uncover
nature's secret.

934
01:00:18,795 --> 01:00:21,457
Halt, horny,

935
01:00:21,498 --> 01:00:26,128
anal, lustful, titties.

936
01:00:26,169 --> 01:00:30,765
- Seduce your sponsor.
- One fuck at a time.

937
01:00:30,807 --> 01:00:33,833
Intimacy equals inadequacy.

938
01:00:33,877 --> 01:00:36,038
What's the matter
with you people?

939
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:38,070
You're wasting
valuable sex time.

940
01:00:38,114 --> 01:00:40,548
Your cunt
is like a charity.

941
01:00:40,583 --> 01:00:45,350
You must give,
give and give...

942
01:00:45,388 --> 01:00:47,481
I'm slipping.

943
01:00:47,524 --> 01:00:49,617
I'm slipping.

944
01:00:49,659 --> 01:00:52,093
Recovery is regression.

945
01:00:52,128 --> 01:00:54,688
It will never pass.

946
01:00:54,731 --> 01:00:57,791
No, don't! I have to.

947
01:00:57,834 --> 01:01:01,133
Don't listen to him.

948
01:01:04,474 --> 01:01:06,874
Stop it.
Please, I'm a Neuter!

949
01:01:10,547 --> 01:01:12,174
Concussion sufferers,

950
01:01:12,215 --> 01:01:15,707
find the new orgasm
and we'll all be supernatural.

951
01:01:15,752 --> 01:01:17,515
It's out there, you just...

952
01:01:17,554 --> 01:01:21,752
I have to do this.

953
01:01:22,959 --> 01:01:26,588
There is no
higher power than sex!

954
01:01:26,629 --> 01:01:28,460
Stop it! Aah-ah!

955
01:01:28,498 --> 01:01:31,797
Stop it, don't touch me.
I've been neutered.

956
01:01:31,835 --> 01:01:33,962
Let no sex act...

957
01:01:34,004 --> 01:01:36,632
You're fired, David,
and no unemployment neither.

958
01:01:36,673 --> 01:01:39,642
It's okay.
This is sex.

959
01:01:39,676 --> 01:01:42,042
There is a beautiful woman
here tonight named Sylvia

960
01:01:42,078 --> 01:01:44,046
who can reveal a secret.

961
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:47,049
And that woman
is my wife!

962
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:50,143
Vaughn, let us show you
eternal sexual satisfaction.

963
01:01:50,186 --> 01:01:52,177
- We love you.
- Love?!

964
01:01:52,222 --> 01:01:55,055
Whatever you do,
don't call it love.

965
01:01:57,694 --> 01:02:00,561
Oh, God!

966
01:02:06,536 --> 01:02:09,369
Let's go sexing!

967
01:02:09,406 --> 01:02:12,398
# Help me Mr. Fireman,
please #

968
01:02:12,442 --> 01:02:14,740
# You know I'm burning
from my head to my knees #

969
01:02:14,778 --> 01:02:17,042
# I'm aflame with
such a burning desire #

970
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:20,447
# That little girl
sets my soul on fire #

971
01:02:20,483 --> 01:02:24,249
# She's got me burning up
like a paper cup #

972
01:02:24,287 --> 01:02:27,484
# Whoo-whoo-whoo,
I'm on fire... #

973
01:02:27,524 --> 01:02:30,357
Come on, Dad!

974
01:02:30,393 --> 01:02:33,294
- Go, baby.
- Get off of me!

975
01:02:33,329 --> 01:02:35,593
Ooh!

976
01:02:35,632 --> 01:02:38,692
Sylvia, Sylvia?

977
01:02:38,735 --> 01:02:42,227
Sylvia?

978
01:02:42,272 --> 01:02:44,570
#... Hmmm, hmmm,
I'm on fire... #

979
01:02:46,409 --> 01:02:49,378
...the shock of each moment
and still be alive.

980
01:02:57,787 --> 01:03:00,620
You've got the devil in your cervix,
that's what you've got.

981
01:03:05,295 --> 01:03:07,490
Come home to my penis
where you belong.

982
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:10,988
I can't, Vaughn.
I'm a libertine.

983
01:03:11,034 --> 01:03:13,161
I say no
to sexual addiction.

984
01:03:13,203 --> 01:03:16,172
You'll get
a yeast infection.

985
01:03:16,206 --> 01:03:18,834
Now is the time
for home invasion!

986
01:03:32,922 --> 01:03:35,413
# Oh, his pop-up
doesn't pop up anymore... #

987
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:37,426
Somebody help!

988
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:39,587
# It just doesn't do
the thing it did before... #

989
01:03:39,629 --> 01:03:41,426
Somebody gave him pills!

990
01:03:41,464 --> 01:03:46,868
#... His pop-up will not
pop up anymore. #

991
01:03:49,372 --> 01:03:51,738
We're gonna make
a nice sauce...

992
01:03:51,774 --> 01:03:53,332
Oh, my God!

993
01:03:53,376 --> 01:03:55,970
Okay, who wants
to fuck me?

994
01:03:56,012 --> 01:03:58,879
I do.

995
01:03:58,915 --> 01:04:01,213
She wants me!

996
01:04:01,251 --> 01:04:03,981
- Get off of him!
- Let me go with her!

997
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:05,954
# Have faith, hope
and charity #

998
01:04:05,989 --> 01:04:07,479
- # Have faith, hope and charity... #
- Sex is disgusting!

999
01:04:07,524 --> 01:04:09,082
# That's the way
to live successfully #

1000
01:04:09,125 --> 01:04:11,184
# That's the way
to live successfully #

1001
01:04:11,227 --> 01:04:12,194
# How do I know?
The Bible tells me so... #

1002
01:04:12,228 --> 01:04:13,217
# How do I know?
The Bible tells me so... #

1003
01:04:13,263 --> 01:04:14,230
# How do I know?
The Bible tells me so... #

1004
01:04:15,832 --> 01:04:18,232
# The Bible
tells me... #

1005
01:04:18,268 --> 01:04:22,227
# Do good
to your enemies #

1006
01:04:22,272 --> 01:04:23,899
# And the blessed Lord
you'll surely please #

1007
01:04:25,708 --> 01:04:29,906
# How do I know?
The Bible tells me so #

1008
01:04:29,946 --> 01:04:32,210
# The Bible
tells me #

1009
01:04:32,248 --> 01:04:35,740
# Don't worry
'bout tomorrow #

1010
01:04:35,785 --> 01:04:39,414
# Just be
real good today #

1011
01:04:39,455 --> 01:04:42,856
# The Lord
is right beside you... #

1012
01:04:42,892 --> 01:04:44,883
All right, everybody,
just come on in.

1013
01:04:44,928 --> 01:04:46,987
That's right,
everybody in.

1014
01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:49,260
Thank you. Thank you so much
for coming out tonight.

1015
01:04:49,299 --> 01:04:50,926
- We got toilet paper?
- We've got toilet paper.

1016
01:04:50,967 --> 01:04:53,060
We couldn't be
doing this without you.

1017
01:04:53,102 --> 01:04:56,265
Move up,
everybody, okay?

1018
01:04:56,306 --> 01:04:58,968
Now, parents,
talk to your children

1019
01:04:59,008 --> 01:05:02,239
tell them
how repulsive sex is.

1020
01:05:02,278 --> 01:05:07,409
And kids, tell your mom and dad
the truth.

1021
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:10,783
Second base isn't just
feeling up a bra strap anymore.

1022
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:12,788
No, it's a blow job.

1023
01:05:12,822 --> 01:05:14,790
No blow jobs!

1024
01:05:16,993 --> 01:05:18,756
Teenagers everywhere,

1025
01:05:18,795 --> 01:05:21,958
come on, join
the Neuter resistance.

1026
01:05:21,998 --> 01:05:25,593
We're not here protesting
anything tonight, are we, Neuters?

1027
01:05:25,635 --> 01:05:27,728
No!

1028
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:29,601
We're for something.

1029
01:05:29,639 --> 01:05:31,607
Yes, yes!

1030
01:05:31,641 --> 01:05:35,543
That's right.
We're for the end of tolerance.

1031
01:05:36,746 --> 01:05:40,204
Tolerance went too far
and we all know it.

1032
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:42,445
No more tolerance!

1033
01:05:42,485 --> 01:05:45,454
No more tolerance!
No more tolerance!

1034
01:05:45,488 --> 01:05:48,980
No more tolerance! No more tolerance!

1035
01:05:49,025 --> 01:05:51,323
Hurry, hurry!

1036
01:05:51,361 --> 01:05:54,728
Hey, feel like
blowing some tunes?

1037
01:05:54,764 --> 01:05:58,097
Come on, don't be shy,
what's the matter with you?

1038
01:05:58,134 --> 01:06:00,102
Hey!

1039
01:06:00,136 --> 01:06:03,003
I'm Sylvia Stickles
and I've got the itch.

1040
01:06:06,609 --> 01:06:08,941
# Hoo-hah, hoo-hah... #

1041
01:06:12,115 --> 01:06:14,106
# Baby, baby... #

1042
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:16,118
# Baby, baby, baby... #

1043
01:06:18,588 --> 01:06:21,489
Down here!
Come on and join the fun!

1044
01:06:22,659 --> 01:06:24,991
Ooh!

1045
01:06:27,964 --> 01:06:30,728
Hey, hey
you white devil!

1046
01:06:30,767 --> 01:06:34,259
Come on up here and give me
some of that strange.

1047
01:06:34,304 --> 01:06:36,670
...pussy wants
some action.

1048
01:06:36,706 --> 01:06:38,674
That's right, Sylvia,

1049
01:06:38,708 --> 01:06:41,677
we're going pearl diving.

1050
01:06:43,012 --> 01:06:46,880
Yes, siree,
I'm looking to go "below 14th Street."

1051
01:06:46,916 --> 01:06:49,714
Get it, Sylvia,
get it while you can.

1052
01:06:49,752 --> 01:06:51,219
I'm coming
as fast as I can.

1053
01:06:52,422 --> 01:06:55,687
No, you're not,
motherfucker.

1054
01:06:55,725 --> 01:06:57,852
Whoa!

1055
01:06:57,894 --> 01:06:59,486
Get your ass
in here now.

1056
01:06:59,529 --> 01:07:03,021
Get out of here,
come on, beat it, Sylvia.

1057
01:07:15,878 --> 01:07:18,312
Fucking tranquilizers.

1058
01:07:23,286 --> 01:07:27,154
It's all right.
Ray Ray is gonna be all better, right?

1059
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:30,853
You betrayed me.

1060
01:07:30,893 --> 01:07:33,487
No, I'm back.
I just had a relapse.

1061
01:07:33,529 --> 01:07:37,226
Heretics!
Because of you I can't have sex.

1062
01:07:37,266 --> 01:07:39,700
It's not our fault,
we're sorry.

1063
01:07:39,736 --> 01:07:42,432
Try this.
"Face The Nation."

1064
01:07:42,472 --> 01:07:45,066
No.
Help me.

1065
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:52,240
- I want to be horny.
- You will be. Concentrate.

1066
01:07:52,281 --> 01:07:56,411
Did you know sex
is even infiltrating the economy?

1067
01:07:56,452 --> 01:08:01,082
Experts estimate
at least 15,000 Americans

1068
01:08:01,124 --> 01:08:04,025
are masturbating at work
right this minute.

1069
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:07,188
Masturbation is costing
American business...

1070
01:08:07,230 --> 01:08:09,562
Come back,
Caprice.

1071
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:12,534
Get out.
This is a Neuter establishment.

1072
01:08:12,568 --> 01:08:14,695
We don't serve
Ray Ray's people here.

1073
01:08:14,737 --> 01:08:18,468
Don't get a breast reduction, Ursula.
Fat Fuck Frank will die.

1074
01:08:18,508 --> 01:08:21,238
Oh, his spiritual life
is already dead.

1075
01:08:21,277 --> 01:08:23,245
But it's coming!

1076
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:26,976
No, it isn't.
There is no new sex act.

1077
01:08:27,016 --> 01:08:29,280
The Ressur-sexion
is about to happen.

1078
01:08:29,318 --> 01:08:31,377
Oh, God,
you're crazy.

1079
01:08:31,421 --> 01:08:34,219
This is Tuesday night.
This is Harford Road.

1080
01:08:34,257 --> 01:08:36,418
This is a school night!

1081
01:08:41,964 --> 01:08:44,797
Ladies,
let's start over.

1082
01:08:44,834 --> 01:08:47,496
Have you heard about
vaginal restoration?

1083
01:08:47,537 --> 01:08:50,438
Any gynecologist
can do it.

1084
01:08:50,473 --> 01:08:53,636
The hymen
is sewn back together.

1085
01:08:53,676 --> 01:08:54,643
Ah-agh!

1086
01:08:54,677 --> 01:08:56,770
Hey, rent a room,
not here.

1087
01:08:56,813 --> 01:09:00,476
- Get the hell out of my store.
- Just come on, you guys.

1088
01:09:00,516 --> 01:09:02,984
Oh, Vaughn,
get this creep out of here.

1089
01:09:03,019 --> 01:09:05,715
Right now,
I want you out of here.

1090
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:11,790
- Ugh!
- # On top of spaghetti #

1091
01:09:11,828 --> 01:09:14,388
# All covered
with cheese... #

1092
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:17,331
Use a napkin,
you freak.

1093
01:09:17,366 --> 01:09:19,800
#... I lost my poor
meatball... #

1094
01:09:19,836 --> 01:09:21,929
# When somebody sneezed... #

1095
01:09:21,971 --> 01:09:23,836
- Oh yeah.
- # When somebody sneezed. #

1096
01:09:28,678 --> 01:09:31,306
They're everywhere.
They're in the bushes.

1097
01:09:31,347 --> 01:09:34,680
Dad, somebody's
licking our tires.

1098
01:09:34,717 --> 01:09:36,912
- Honey, don't look.
- Hey, pervert!

1099
01:09:36,953 --> 01:09:39,012
Leave our family alone.

1100
01:09:39,055 --> 01:09:42,320
- Oof!
- Come on, let's just get out of here.

1101
01:09:42,358 --> 01:09:43,689
Oh-ho-ho. Oh.

1102
01:09:43,726 --> 01:09:46,456
Ooh, ever hear
of helicoptering?

1103
01:09:46,496 --> 01:09:48,794
Whipping someone's face
with your erect penis?

1104
01:09:48,831 --> 01:09:50,560
- Whap, whap, whap!
- Old hat.

1105
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,727
- Shrimping?
- Everybody licks toes.

1106
01:09:52,768 --> 01:09:55,362
Tromboning... jacking off
when you're taking a crap?

1107
01:09:55,404 --> 01:09:58,464
I did that during
the Reagan Administration.

1108
01:09:58,508 --> 01:10:02,035
Try some vitamins.

1109
01:10:05,181 --> 01:10:08,344
I need to satisfy someone.

1110
01:10:08,384 --> 01:10:10,352
Oh, yeah.

1111
01:10:15,157 --> 01:10:17,250
# Tell me a story #

1112
01:10:17,293 --> 01:10:19,261
# Tell me
a story #

1113
01:10:19,295 --> 01:10:22,731
# Tell me a story,
remember what you said #

1114
01:10:22,765 --> 01:10:24,926
# You promised me,
you said you would #

1115
01:10:24,967 --> 01:10:26,764
# You've got to give in
so I'll be good #

1116
01:10:26,802 --> 01:10:28,565
# Tell me a story... #

1117
01:10:28,604 --> 01:10:30,663
yes, Mommy's
drying dishes

1118
01:10:30,706 --> 01:10:33,436
so that pretty little baby
will have clean plate-plates

1119
01:10:33,476 --> 01:10:35,740
when we move
to our new house.

1120
01:10:35,778 --> 01:10:38,406
#... Go home without
my raise in pay #

1121
01:10:38,447 --> 01:10:42,213
- # Home by the fire where a man can... #
- Mama! Mama!

1122
01:10:42,251 --> 01:10:44,583
# Sleep out there
by the chair #

1123
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:46,781
# Not a worry,
not a care... #

1124
01:10:58,267 --> 01:11:00,861
Come on, you're the cunnilingus
concussion king.

1125
01:11:00,903 --> 01:11:02,461
Am I? Am I?

1126
01:11:02,505 --> 01:11:04,837
So many vaginas,
so little time.

1127
01:11:04,874 --> 01:11:06,432
I try
and do good work.

1128
01:11:06,475 --> 01:11:08,340
Sometimes
chocolate helps.

1129
01:11:08,377 --> 01:11:10,368
Oh, give me
the green one.

1130
01:11:10,413 --> 01:11:12,381
Boy, those fuckers
work.

1131
01:11:12,415 --> 01:11:14,975
I managed to cop some spanish fly
down on the block.

1132
01:11:16,552 --> 01:11:18,543
Oh, that's some
good shit.

1133
01:11:18,588 --> 01:11:19,850
- Felching?
- Done it.

1134
01:11:19,889 --> 01:11:21,857
- Getting your "red wings"?
- I got 'em.

1135
01:11:21,891 --> 01:11:24,325
- Plate job?
- Over and under.

1136
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:26,294
- Blossoms?
- Don't want them.

1137
01:11:26,329 --> 01:11:27,796
Ever tried these?

1138
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:31,994
Damn Viagra.
And I'm already there.

1139
01:11:43,312 --> 01:11:45,746
"Astral-orgasm,"

1140
01:11:45,781 --> 01:11:49,376
reaching an out-of-body state
through sexual arousal.

1141
01:12:03,165 --> 01:12:06,999
Let's go sexing!

1142
01:12:12,008 --> 01:12:14,977
Come on, you can't do that inside.
Take it outside.

1143
01:12:15,011 --> 01:12:17,639
Yeah, I'm looking
for to get blowed.

1144
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:18,738
We don't have that.

1145
01:12:18,781 --> 01:12:21,341
I've been scarred!

1146
01:12:22,785 --> 01:12:24,150
Get off me,
I'm straight.

1147
01:12:24,186 --> 01:12:26,484
So's spaghetti till you get it
heated up.

1148
01:12:26,522 --> 01:12:29,184
I tell you, this virginal
operation works.

1149
01:12:29,225 --> 01:12:31,489
Even the most skeptical man
will be convinced.

1150
01:12:31,527 --> 01:12:33,495
You're what I'd call
a pity fuck?

1151
01:12:33,529 --> 01:12:37,625
The restored virgin
fills a gelatin capsule with blood

1152
01:12:37,667 --> 01:12:40,864
and inserts it into her vagina
just before intercourse.

1153
01:12:40,903 --> 01:12:42,530
You're all crazy.

1154
01:12:42,571 --> 01:12:45,404
When she has sex for the first time,
the hymen will pop.

1155
01:12:45,441 --> 01:12:48,467
You'll be a virgin
for the second time.

1156
01:12:48,511 --> 01:12:51,947
- Leave us alone.
- Help!

1157
01:12:54,016 --> 01:12:56,041
Hey! Hey!
Call the National Guard.

1158
01:12:56,085 --> 01:12:57,245
To hell with Harford Road!

1159
01:12:57,286 --> 01:12:59,151
We're moving back to D.C.
Where we belong.

1160
01:12:59,188 --> 01:13:01,247
- Frank, call them off.
- But, Ursula,

1161
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:04,691
they are hotter than a fresh fucked fox
in a forest fire, you know that.

1162
01:13:04,727 --> 01:13:08,458
I am pure now, Fat Blank Frank,
I'm a Neuter.

1163
01:13:08,497 --> 01:13:10,192
Just let them puppies
loose, honey.

1164
01:13:10,232 --> 01:13:13,429
I have faced the beast of lust
and I have won.

1165
01:13:13,469 --> 01:13:16,267
Besides,
my back hurts.

1166
01:13:16,305 --> 01:13:19,934
I get rashes.
Simple chores bother me.

1167
01:13:19,975 --> 01:13:22,603
I would like to sleep on my stomach,
if you don't mind.

1168
01:13:22,645 --> 01:13:25,136
Please, Ursula...!

1169
01:13:25,181 --> 01:13:28,673
- Let's go sexing.
- N-O spells no!

1170
01:13:28,718 --> 01:13:32,176
- Come on, man...
- This isn't that kind of place. Lady!

1171
01:13:35,891 --> 01:13:39,019
aah... auto-erotic
asphyxiation.

1172
01:13:39,061 --> 01:13:41,086
Oh, you oughta
try it, ahh!

1173
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:45,089
- Let me in, you know you got it.
- Get away! We're not horny.

1174
01:13:45,134 --> 01:13:47,432
We're married.
We don't want anything.

1175
01:13:49,805 --> 01:13:52,035
Somebody somewhere,

1176
01:13:52,074 --> 01:13:55,305
finish me up!

1177
01:14:16,432 --> 01:14:18,491
- Huh?
- Feel like getting lucky?

1178
01:14:18,534 --> 01:14:21,503
Huh? Huh-Uh.

1179
01:14:23,205 --> 01:14:25,765
Hey, how about you?
Huh? How about you?

1180
01:14:25,808 --> 01:14:28,470
Uh-huh.

1181
01:14:35,284 --> 01:14:39,084
You are barred from
the Pinewood Park-and-Pay.

1182
01:14:41,123 --> 01:14:42,954
Ever hear of
mononucleosis?

1183
01:14:42,992 --> 01:14:45,256
Get help!

1184
01:14:48,864 --> 01:14:52,630
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, polar bear,

1185
01:14:52,668 --> 01:14:54,693
- you know what an "otter" is?
- No.

1186
01:14:54,737 --> 01:15:00,107
It's a bear cub who
isn't fat or hairy yet, but will be.

1187
01:15:00,142 --> 01:15:02,872
Find me
a significant otter.

1188
01:15:05,481 --> 01:15:08,143
Ungh!

1189
01:15:09,618 --> 01:15:11,142
Whoop!

1190
01:15:12,221 --> 01:15:14,086
Oof!

1191
01:15:16,358 --> 01:15:18,656
Oh!

1192
01:15:29,872 --> 01:15:31,635
Yes!

1193
01:15:31,674 --> 01:15:33,642
Get out, you disgusting
piece of filth.

1194
01:15:33,676 --> 01:15:35,837
Get out now and
never come back.

1195
01:15:49,225 --> 01:15:51,921
Yeah, baby!

1196
01:15:52,928 --> 01:15:54,327
Oh, no, not you!

1197
01:15:54,363 --> 01:15:56,263
Yeah, baby!

1198
01:15:56,298 --> 01:15:58,266
Yeah, baby!
Whoo-ooh!

1199
01:16:02,304 --> 01:16:03,965
Yeah!

1200
01:16:04,006 --> 01:16:06,907
Ursula! Ursula! Ursula!

1201
01:16:14,049 --> 01:16:16,074
Mom!

1202
01:16:16,118 --> 01:16:18,348
# Yeah, my gal is
red hot #

1203
01:16:18,387 --> 01:16:20,412
# Your gal
ain't doodly squat #

1204
01:16:20,456 --> 01:16:23,857
# Well she ain't got no money,
but man, she's really got a lot... #

1205
01:16:23,893 --> 01:16:27,192
# Oh, baby, let me bang
your box #

1206
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:31,228
# Baby, let me bang
your box #

1207
01:16:31,267 --> 01:16:33,701
# Baby, let me
bang your box #

1208
01:16:33,736 --> 01:16:36,330
# Baby, let me bang
your box #

1209
01:16:36,372 --> 01:16:39,239
# Baby, let me bang it,
baby, let me bang it #

1210
01:16:39,275 --> 01:16:41,903
# Baby, let me bang
your box #

1211
01:16:52,788 --> 01:16:56,383
#... Let me bang your box,
oh, baby, I'll give you a thrill... #

1212
01:16:56,425 --> 01:16:58,484
This is a liberated area.

1213
01:16:58,527 --> 01:17:01,257
The sexual revolution
has been won.

1214
01:17:01,297 --> 01:17:03,458
You can finally be free.
Come out.

1215
01:17:03,499 --> 01:17:05,467
The Neuters have fled.

1216
01:17:05,501 --> 01:17:07,128
There is somebody
for everybody.

1217
01:17:07,169 --> 01:17:09,637
- That means you!
- Ray Ray!

1218
01:17:09,672 --> 01:17:13,199
Straight, gay or bi, there's a new sex
act just waiting for you.

1219
01:17:13,242 --> 01:17:16,370
Sex for everybody!
Fuck your neighbors joyously.

1220
01:17:16,412 --> 01:17:19,347
Hurry!
You, on your front lawn.

1221
01:17:19,381 --> 01:17:21,315
Join us.
Come on, let's go.

1222
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:23,818
The Neuters are history.

1223
01:17:23,852 --> 01:17:25,843
We are taking over!

1224
01:17:25,888 --> 01:17:27,685
Today Harford Road...

1225
01:17:27,723 --> 01:17:30,783
Tomorrow the world!

1226
01:17:30,826 --> 01:17:34,227
Then all of Baltimore, then up
to Washington and finally New York,

1227
01:17:34,263 --> 01:17:36,891
the Midwest, the South,
California,

1228
01:17:36,932 --> 01:17:39,332
Europe, Japan,
North Korea...

1229
01:17:39,368 --> 01:17:41,598
the whole world will soon
fuck at the same time.

1230
01:17:41,637 --> 01:17:44,197
Sexual anarchy
will finally happen.

1231
01:17:48,544 --> 01:17:50,603
Come on, let's go!
Jump on!

1232
01:18:00,222 --> 01:18:02,713
Ladies and gentlemen,
the captain has informed us

1233
01:18:02,758 --> 01:18:04,248
that we have begun
our final approach

1234
01:18:04,293 --> 01:18:06,386
into Ronald Reagan
Washington National Airport.

1235
01:18:06,428 --> 01:18:08,521
Mr. Hasselhoff?

1236
01:18:08,564 --> 01:18:11,556
Sorry to interrupt,
but you are my favorite star.

1237
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,125
- Can I have your autograph?
- Yeah, sure.

1238
01:18:14,169 --> 01:18:16,000
- Thank you.
- If you must use the lavatory

1239
01:18:16,038 --> 01:18:18,563
prior to our scheduled
arrival, please do so at this time.

1240
01:18:18,607 --> 01:18:21,235
Excuse me one second.
Thanks.

1241
01:18:23,612 --> 01:18:25,580
Per FAA regulations,

1242
01:18:25,614 --> 01:18:28,174
please put away
any electronic devices.

1243
01:18:28,217 --> 01:18:31,311
Flight crew,
prepare for landing.

1244
01:18:37,393 --> 01:18:39,088
Sylvia!

1245
01:18:39,128 --> 01:18:41,824
Ursula!

1246
01:18:41,864 --> 01:18:43,889
You're beautiful, baby...

1247
01:18:43,932 --> 01:18:46,332
I'm past that,
Fat Frank, forever!

1248
01:18:48,437 --> 01:18:50,405
Yeah, come on.

1249
01:19:04,486 --> 01:19:08,855
Oh, my pills!

1250
01:19:09,925 --> 01:19:12,894
Oh!

1251
01:19:33,615 --> 01:19:36,743
Oh...

1252
01:19:52,701 --> 01:19:56,159
Honey...

1253
01:19:56,205 --> 01:19:59,106
can I have some lunch
downtown?

1254
01:19:59,141 --> 01:20:02,235
- Oh.
- Dad, ah!

1255
01:20:02,277 --> 01:20:06,407
Oh-hh!

1256
01:20:08,283 --> 01:20:12,686
- Ha-ha!
- No, Vaughn, I've done that.

1257
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:16,781
You know, don't you?

1258
01:20:31,807 --> 01:20:33,900
Oh!

1259
01:20:47,656 --> 01:20:49,749
Oh-hh!

1260
01:21:00,135 --> 01:21:02,228
Oh-hh...!

1261
01:21:11,513 --> 01:21:13,743
She was
a Neuter.

1262
01:21:13,782 --> 01:21:16,945
A sexual anorexic
whose time has come.

1263
01:21:40,509 --> 01:21:42,704
Ow! Oh!

1264
01:21:57,826 --> 01:21:59,293
Big Ethel...?

1265
01:22:05,867 --> 01:22:08,529
Ooh-oh!

1266
01:23:08,096 --> 01:23:10,121
The big "O."

1267
01:23:12,868 --> 01:23:16,201
Do it for us
one more time, Ray Ray.

1268
01:23:18,473 --> 01:23:20,805
Now, Ray Ray, now!

1269
01:23:20,842 --> 01:23:24,869
Now!

1270
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:30,682
Let's go sexing!

1271
01:23:52,174 --> 01:23:56,167
# At the end of a rainbow #

1272
01:23:56,211 --> 01:24:00,113
# You'll find
a pot of gold #

1273
01:24:00,148 --> 01:24:03,914
# At the end of a story #

1274
01:24:03,952 --> 01:24:07,251
# You'll find
it's all been told #

1275
01:24:07,289 --> 01:24:11,726
# But our love
has a treasure #

1276
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:15,252
# Our hearts
can always spend #

1277
01:24:15,297 --> 01:24:19,461
# And it has a story #

1278
01:24:19,501 --> 01:24:24,370
# Without any end #

1279
01:24:24,406 --> 01:24:28,206
# At the end of a river #

1280
01:24:28,243 --> 01:24:32,043
# The water stops
its flow #

1281
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:36,278
# At the end of a highway #

1282
01:24:36,318 --> 01:24:39,378
# There's no place
you can go #

1283
01:24:39,421 --> 01:24:43,448
# But just tell me
you love me #

1284
01:24:43,492 --> 01:24:47,861
# And you are only mine #

1285
01:24:47,896 --> 01:24:51,627
# And our love will go on #

1286
01:24:51,666 --> 01:24:54,931
# Till the end... #

1287
01:24:54,970 --> 01:24:59,304
# Of time #

1288
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:08,782
# At the end of a river #

1289
01:25:08,817 --> 01:25:12,913
# The water stops
its flow #

1290
01:25:12,954 --> 01:25:16,890
# At the end of a highway #

1291
01:25:16,925 --> 01:25:20,122
# There's no place
you can go #

1292
01:25:20,162 --> 01:25:24,258
# But just tell me
you love me #

1293
01:25:24,299 --> 01:25:28,360
# And you are only mine #

1294
01:25:28,403 --> 01:25:32,601
# And our love will go on #

1295
01:25:32,641 --> 01:25:36,441
# Till the end... #

1296
01:25:36,478 --> 01:25:41,381
# Of time #

1297
01:25:41,416 --> 01:25:46,080
# Till the end... #

1298
01:25:46,121 --> 01:25:51,491
# Of time. #

1299
01:26:02,404 --> 01:26:05,066
# Let's go sexing #

1300
01:26:06,842 --> 01:26:09,106
# Let's go
sexing #

1301
01:26:11,112 --> 01:26:13,376
# Let's go sexing #

1302
01:26:15,517 --> 01:26:17,712
# You know I love you #

1303
01:26:17,752 --> 01:26:20,016
# When you make me
feel good #

1304
01:26:20,055 --> 01:26:22,023
# A funny feeling #

1305
01:26:22,057 --> 01:26:24,252
# Pounding in my head #

1306
01:26:24,292 --> 01:26:26,260
# My hands are trembling #

1307
01:26:26,294 --> 01:26:28,626
# My eyes are turning red #

1308
01:26:28,663 --> 01:26:30,494
# I'm a desperate man #

1309
01:26:30,532 --> 01:26:33,228
# With a heavy load #

1310
01:26:33,268 --> 01:26:35,099
# Like a volcano #

1311
01:26:35,136 --> 01:26:37,400
# I'm about to explode #

1312
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:39,703
# Let's go sexing #

1313
01:26:41,443 --> 01:26:44,003

# Come on, concussion,
liberate my brain #

1323
01:27:33,962 --> 01:27:36,055
# My pulse is rushing #

1324
01:27:36,097 --> 01:27:38,497
# There's lava in my veins #

1325
01:27:38,533 --> 01:27:40,626
# Pumping with passion #

1326
01:27:40,669 --> 01:27:42,728
# Throbbing with desire #

1327
01:27:42,771 --> 01:27:46,707
# A heatseeker missile
with a burning tailfire #

1328
01:27:46,741 --> 01:27:49,608
# Oh, let's go sexing #

1329

1333
01:28:17,172 --> 01:28:19,697
# I'm a wild Roman candle #

1334
01:28:19,741 --> 01:28:21,709
# With, baby, loads of fire #

1335
01:28:21,743 --> 01:28:24,371
