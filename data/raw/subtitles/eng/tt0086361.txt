1
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,000
One, two, three, four.

2
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,200
One, two, three, four.

3
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,200
Back, two, three...
Really stretch it...three, four.

4
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,400
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

5
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,900
Keep going.

6
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,500
Tony...

7
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,400
- What happened?
- Typical.

8
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,600
- What do you mean?
- l turned them down.

9
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,400
- Come on. What happened really?
- Tony! Come on, you're late!

10
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,500
- l'll talk to you later.
- Fatima!

11
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,300
- Why are you late?
- My Rolls got towed away.

12
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,700
Don't play, we've got people here.

13
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,000
lf l gave you $1 ,000,000
would you be mad at me?

14
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,400
- Sure!
- You would?

15
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,900
Still? That's a beautiful dress
you've got on.

16
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,900
lt is. You know, l can see them...
Sexy.

17
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,400
How about a quarter, as
a down payment on that $1 ,000,000?

18
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,100
Think l won't keep it?
l will keep it. Believe that.

19
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,300
l know you will take it.

20
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,000
There you go.
One, two, three...

21
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,900
...four, five, six, seven, eight.

22
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,500
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

23
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,100
Two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

24
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,000
Try again from the top.
Come on, you're dancing! You love it!

25
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,800
OK, once again.
Five, six, seven, eight!

26
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:05,000
Look in the mirrors at yourselves.
You got attitude. You got strength.

27
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,300
Attitude, come on...
Molly, watch your line.

28
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,800
Be proud! You're dancers.
You love dancing.

29
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,200
That's it. We've got potential here.
We've got real potential.

30
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,300
Any messages?

31
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,000
Any messages?

32
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,100
- Hey, Tony, how's your love life?
- All right.

33
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,200
- You know why l order so many drinks?
- You're an alcoholic.

34
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,900
No.
Because l love to watch your walk.

35
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,800
- Oooh, oooh! l like that!
- Great walk.

36
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,600
How are you, Margaret?
Freddie, where's my order?

37
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,600
Coming up.
Some of your groupie friends are here.

38
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,900
- Who?
- Those friends of yours.

39
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,400
- They're acquaintances.
- How about sharing the wealth?

40
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,100
- Am l your booking agent?
- You don't want to share?

41
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,500
l don't need your hand-me-downs.

42
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:28,200
- Have you got emotional problems?
- You think l need a shrink?

43
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,400
- How late are you working tonight?
- Till three.

44
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,300
- Want to come over?
- Last time, l almost got brain damage.

45
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,800
You party too hard.
You ought to be a tag team.

46
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,700
Good guys are hard to find.

47
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,100
Why don't you try the army?

48
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,300
- Are we on later?
- No, l can't make it.

49
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Why not?

50
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,200
- Lately, l've been career oriented.
- What's that mean?

51
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,800
l don't have time for relationships
right now.

52
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,000
That right?

53
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,500
Well, let me tell you something.

54
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:44,400
Guys like you aren't relationships,
you're exercise.

55
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,900
- Why do you have to go? lt's only six.
- l want to get something going today.

56
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,500
- Don't you want to stay for breakfast?
- No, l'm not hungry.

57
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,200
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

58
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,200
l just want to get something
going today.

59
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,400
- You will.
- l'll see you later.

60
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,900
- l'll miss you.
- You don't have to say that, Jackie.

61
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,200
l know l don't.

62
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,700
l'm a dancer by nature. l studied
for four years and now l teach.

63
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,000
- But l'm very available for TV work.
- No.

64
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,100
Good day.

65
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,800
Acting roles...l do dramatic parts.
l can do comedy roles.

66
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,600
l'd consider doing a soap opera

67
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,900
or even a roadshow,
a musical of some sort.

68
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,800
l would consider
doing a print ad.

69
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,600
lf you're looking for the outdoor type,
l'm good at some sports,

70
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,800
like weightlifting and stickball

71
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,000
and push-ups, and...

72
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,200
lf absolutely necessary, l don't mind
doing any kind of extra work.

73
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,500
Except l promised my mother
l'd never do any nudity.

74
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,500
l guess she's afraid
that l might get a cold.

75
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,800
But the fact still is,
l'm a dancer by nature.

76
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
Whatever.

77
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Yeah, whatever.

78
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,500
lt's like you're invisible.

79
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,300
They make you feel
like you're wasting your time.

80
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,900
What's really weird is that
they all sound like my father used to.

81
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,400
Why be down on yourself?
You know what you can do.

82
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,800
- What about you?
- What about me?

83
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,100
You've been doing choruses
for six years.

84
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,400
Don't you want to do something
that's all you?

85
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,100
- lf it happens, good. lf not, too bad.
- How could you think that way?

86
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,600
A woman's dancing career
is half as long as a man's.

87
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,900
So l have half as many chances
as you of making it.

88
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,700
- l've got to be real with myself.
- l don't know, l guess so.

89
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,400
Mm...cherry.

90
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,400
- See you later.
- Will you come tonight?

91
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,900
- lt's the last show.
- l don't think l can make it.

92
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,800
- Why the excuses?
- What excuses?

93
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,700
Don't play this competition thing
with me.

94
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,700
Just because you're in a show
and l'm not, that ain't competition.

95
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,100
- Well, what is it?
- Envy!

96
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,800
Will you be there?

97
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,500
Got any messages?

98
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,700
lt's an inside joke.

99
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,100
- Tony!
- Hey, Jackie! You were great!

100
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:20,700
- Are you sure?
- l'm positive. You was fantastic.

101
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:25,600
- l was nervous knowing you were here.
- You shouldn't have been.

102
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,400
- Are you sure l was OK?
- You were great.

103
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,500
- l'll change. Will you wait?
- Yeah.

104
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,100
- l'll meet you outside.
- Sure, why not?

105
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,800
Hi.

106
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,000
Yes?

107
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,800
l wanted to tell you
l think you're an incredible dancer.

108
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,200
Thank you very much.

109
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,900
l'm a friend of Jackie Coll's.
Tony Manero.

110
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:22,500
- lt's important to have friends.
- l was saying that over breakfast.

111
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,200
Did you want something?
An autograph, or something?

112
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,900
l'd like to get together and talk
some time. Would that be possible?

113
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,700
- About what?
- About how incredible you are.

114
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,700
- Thank you, but l already know that.
- Say what?

115
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,600
l already know.

116
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,500
l used to be incredible myself
when l lived in Brooklyn.

117
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,500
- Really? What happened?
- l moved to Manhattan.

118
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:04,000
So, where exactly are you imported
from? The vicinity of England?

119
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
- Very good.
- See? l know.

120
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,700
- So what do you do?
- l'm sort of into telling the future.

121
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:20,700
- Great things will happen for you.
- Oh, really? What great things?

122
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,600
You're going to meet this really,
really sensitive, nice type of guy.

123
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,700
Once you get to know him,
you're going to be crazy about him.

124
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,700
- l am?
- Yeah!

125
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,900
So where is he?

126
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,700
l'll go get him. You just wait here.
You'll love him. He's great.

127
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:45,700
Hey, Rico! She's waiting to see you.
Really! Come on, she's great!

128
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,900
Really!
No, l'll get him.

129
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:52,000
l got her here. She's nice.
No problem. You'll love her.

130
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,600
Come on...
Wait! Well, come on.

131
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,700
- lt didn't happen.
- lmported, indeed!

132
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,800
- How are you doing?
- Strong draught in there, huh?

133
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,900
- Come in.
- You nearly broke my face with the door.

134
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,600
l'm giving you my best come-ons
and you try to mangle my face.

135
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,800
- Well, Jimmy, you see...
- Tony!

136
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Whatever. You seem to take pleasure
in treating women as incredibly stupid.

137
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:45,000
lf you're mad at me, l apologise.
l thought l was being charming.

138
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,400
You did try to damage my head.
But the thing is that l...

139
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,500
l amazingly respect your dancing
talent. And your womanhood.

140
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,100
l didn't always respect womanhood,
but since l moved to Manhattan,

141
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:02,800
l got this new, mature outlook. l don't
smoke, l don't drink, l don't curse.

142
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,900
Anyway, l would like to take you out.

143
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,300
Maybe we could have a drink,
maybe have some dinner. And...

144
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,700
But someplace informal, because
my suits are all being pressed.

145
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,400
Well, thank you
but l have to go home early tonight.

146
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,900
- We're auditioning for the new show.
- Are you in it?

147
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:28,800
- Definitely. Are you a dancer?
- Yeah, couldn't you tell?

148
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,100
Oh, of course.
Why don't you come by tomorrow?

149
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:36,300
- l could put in a good word for you.
- No, don't do that. Please.

150
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,900
l really don't need any help
in that department.

151
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,600
- OK.
- Are you sure you can't go out tonight?

152
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,600
Sorry.

153
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,100
Well, if l don't see you any more,

154
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,600
nice meeting you
and being insulted by you.

155
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,100
My pleasure.

156
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:00,700
- Aren't you coming tomorrow?
- l knew you wanted to see me again.

157
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,900
Taxi!

158
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,300
- Want to eat?
- l got to get to the club.

159
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,900
- Why do you work at that club?
- Extra money.

160
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,400
- There's an audition tomorrow.
- l told you a week ago.

161
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,900
- Really?
- Yeah. You'll audition, won't you?

162
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,600
Why not?
Rejection's a hobby now.

163
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,100
Oh, listen to you!

164
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,000
Small world, isn't it?
Goodnight.

165
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,200
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight. Do you know her?

166
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,200
- Just informally.
- How did you meet her?

167
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,200
She was passing.
l said she was an OK dancer.

168
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,500
You told her she's OK!

169
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,200
- Something to that effect.
- She's a great dancer!

170
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,900
- Whose is the limo?
- l think it belongs to her.

171
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,900
- She comes from money.
- Really?

172
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,300
ls she heavily involved
with someone?

173
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,600
What do you mean?

174
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,900
Has she got a lot of guys
drooling over her?

175
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,400
l don't want to hear
if you're hot over somebody.

176
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,900
l just respect her dancing.

177
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,200
Did you hear the way she talks?
lt's so intelligent. l love it.

178
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:21,400
An accent doesn't make you intelligent.
lf it did, you'd be Einstein.

179
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,100
Jackie, l'm not trying to make
you jealous. You're a good dancer.

180
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,300
- What can l say?
- Don't play these games.

181
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,600
- What games?
- l'll see you tomorrow.

182
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,800
Come on, l don't even know her!

183
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,600
Are you sure you don't want
something to eat?

184
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,500
Manero, you've got a way with words!

185
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,800
Very good. Excellent!

186
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:23,600
Just in case you've got to hear it
again, it's whoever's right for the show.

187
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,300
Michelle, Tracy...

188
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,800
Smitty...

189
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,900
Karen, yes...
Sorry.

190
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,500
Jackie, you worked real hard.
Yes.

191
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,300
- OK, that's it. Next group!
- OK, men please!

192
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,900
- Hi, l'm Joy.
- l'm happiness.

193
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:57,700
l bet you are.
l'm the assistant choreographer.

194
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:02,400
Any questions regarding the routine,
please ask me now.

195
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:09,800
Listen up! This time, try the whole
combination right through to the end.

196
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,400
lf l don't see you again,
you got beautiful legs.

197
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,600
- So do you.
- Listen up!

198
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,700
lf you've finished dancing,
move off stage!

199
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,100
You're always causing trouble.
Get out of here!

200
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,100
OK, now get ready.
Joy, count it down.

201
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,400
OK, music!

202
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
That's good.
That's enough, thank you.

203
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,800
We need pictures, résumés,
phone numbers.

204
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,300
We'll get back to you.
You were all excellent,

205
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,000
but l only need two.
Thank you.

206
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,200
Hello, Jimmy.

207
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,100
- lt's Tony!
- Oh, whatever.

208
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,900
- l know what you must be thinking.
- Do you?

209
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,000
They'll call. Don't worry.

210
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,500
Whatever.

211
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,700
- You were very good.
- Thank you.

212
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,000
- l mean it.
- Really?

213
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,100
- Yeah.
- Sounds like you appreciated me.

214
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,200
Yes, you could say that.

215
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,400
- Could l ask you something?
- What?

216
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,200
lf you appreciate me
and l appreciate you,

217
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,800
how about getting together
and we could appreciate each other?

218
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,400
- Appreciate?
- Yeah, like for many hours.

219
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,700
l have a singing lesson
l'll have to cancel.

220
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,700
That's all right. l got a dance class
l'd have to cancel.

221
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,000
And then l'd have to cancel
my manicure.

222
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,900
l'd have to cancel
my meeting with the mayor.

223
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,100
And then l'd have to cancel
my yoga class.

224
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:46,200
That's all right.
l'd have to cancel my brain operation.

225
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,400
Do you think that's a good idea?

226
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,800
Laura, are you rich or something?

227
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
l told you, it isn't important.

228
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,800
- Why? ls it some secret?
- lt's just furniture.

229
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,600
Come on! You'd have to work 1 0 shows
to afford this.

230
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,100
Oh, shush.

231
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:14,300
- Look, we had a good time.
- What? Did l miss something here?

232
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,100
l changed the subject.
We had a good night.

233
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,300
We had a great night.
Great night.

234
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,400
l want to tell you something.

235
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,100
You don't know me well.

236
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,800
And with my past,
l don't respect many people.

237
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,100
- But l do respect you.
- Oh. Thank you.

238
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:40,600
And when you dance, oh, man,
l could watch you for hours. Really!

239
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,700
- lt's like watching smoke move.
- l know.

240
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:50,200
lt's like you've done something
with your life. You're significant.

241
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,000
l think it's time
we said goodnight.

242
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,000
- What's wrong?
- Nothing! lt's just 3.00.

243
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:05,300
- And l've got to rehearse tomorrow.
- Are you serious?

244
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,500
- Yeah.
- Definitely?

245
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,800
- Yeah.
- Oh, no, this is a flash. You can't...

246
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,600
- l've never been asked to leave.
- Don't take it personally.

247
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,100
- l've got to! There's nobody else here!
- That's true. Well...

248
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:24,900
Definitely? This is it?
l mean, tonight, it's over, that's it?

249
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,900
Oh, no! Oh, Tony,
you don't think that, do you? Do you?

250
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,800
lt's just until tomorrow.

251
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,600
- Hello?
- Jackie!

252
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,700
Tony?
Where are you?

253
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,700
l'm making sure the streets are safe
for women and children.

254
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,000
- Somebody`s got to do it.
- Are you OK?

255
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,800
- Great! Are you alone?
- What?

256
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Are you alone?
ls there a vacancy next to you?

257
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,500
- There's a vacancy. Why?
- l was just curious.

258
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,200
Why are you up so late?
A professional should watch her health.

259
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,600
l'll see you tomorrow
if l don't drown.

260
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
That boy is strange.

261
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,800
Ring.

262
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,800
Don't touch that phone!
Get off!

263
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,200
Yes! Yes, this is Tony Manero.
Are you kidding?

264
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,300
Hold on a second...
Turn down the radio!

265
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,600

You're kidding?

266
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,800
- That boy is crazy.
- When do l start?

267
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
What time? Where? All right!
Thank you! Thank you! l'll be there!

268
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,000
Way to go, Manero!

269
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,500

- Dancing! Don't you remember l dance?
- No nudity, l hope!

274
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,300
Keep your clothes on. You hear me?

275
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,300
- You hear me?
- Come on, come off it.

276
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,200

277
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,100

and tell you all the details.

278
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,300

l hope we never change

282
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,100
lf you feel the same

283
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,200
Time will make us so much stronger

284
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,900

l give it back to you

286
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,200
We give our love to one another

287
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,400
Waking up with my eyes open wide

288
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,600
Waking up, you`re still sleeping

You`ve been the one

291
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,300
You spoke so soft and tenderly

292
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:43,500
You spoke so soft and tenderly

293
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:47,700
You pulled the soul from under me

294
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:52,400

298
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,700
- Things are happening.
- Yeah. Are you going to work now?

299
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,500
Yeah, l've got to give in my notice.

300
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,300
You didn't put in a word for me
with the director?

301
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,400
- No!
- l got this on my own?

302
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,100

- Really!
- All right!

304
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,300
That singer and you
were harmonising a little too well.

305
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,400
- He's just a friend.
- Why is he staring at you like that?

306
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,500
- Come on, Tony, don't.
- No, really.

307
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:43,600
- He's staring at you.
- What is wrong with you?

308
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,000
l don't know.
l just don't like guys like that.

309
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,100
- You are crazy tonight.
- Maybe l'm feeling a little emotional.

310
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,600
- Meet me after work?
- Yeah, two o'clock.

311
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,800
- OK. l'll see you at two.

312
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,500
Waking up with my eyes open wide

Hello. lt's very cold.

00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,600
- How are you doing?

320
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,900
But you look like you're freezing.

- No, no.
- We all set?

322
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,500

Nice meeting you.

328
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,000
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

329
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,100
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

330
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:48,200
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

331
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,400
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

332
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,500
One, two, three, four.

333
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,800
That's it. Relax!

334
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:03,700
We have a conceptual interpretation
problem, which is easy to overcome

335
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:08,600
if you forget that you're dancers
working for a couple of bucks.

336
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,500
You're translators of body language.
That's all dancing is: body language.

337
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,900
So don't waste my time
going through the motions of emotions.

338
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,000
You got to feel
what the hell you're doing.

339
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,500
The show's called ''Satan's Alley''.

340
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,900
lt's a journey through hell.
lt ends with an ascent to heaven.

341
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:32,600
lt's simple, but if it's going to work,
you've got to bust your asses!

342
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:43,100
- l didn't say anything.
- But l... Shoot me. Shoot me twice.

343
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:47,200
- lt's all right, really.
- l got hung up. What can l say?

344
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,300
You don't have to say anything.

345
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,100
When you say that,
l know you want me to say something.

346
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:58,000
- OK, what do you want to talk about?
- l don't know. What about you?

347
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,700
lt's the lovers, the young lovers.

348
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,300
- l've got to get going.
- l'll give you a call later, all right?

349
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,500
l'll call you later.

350
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,500
lf you're really her friend,
do her a favour.

351
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,200
- What?
- Teach her to dance.

352
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,800
There's nothing wrong
with her dancing.

353
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,300
l really like her, too.
But she's ordinary.

354
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,100
- But you're very good.
- Where are you coming from?

355
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,900
- ls something wrong?
- l don't like being led on.

356
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,600
- Who's leading you on?
- l call you up, you're not home!

357
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:41,200
Then l wait all night for you and
you bring some guy home with you.

358
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,000
- Are you talking to me?
- Did what we did mean nothing?

359
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,700
- lt was nice.
- Nice, everyday! Like breakfast?

360
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,900
l usually skip breakfast.
Look, l'll see you later.

361
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,700
- l'm talking to you!
- l said later.

362
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,400
- Come here!
- Take your bloody hands off me!

363
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,500
Do you think l'm some little groupie?

364
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:08,100
We met, l liked you, we made it.
What do you think it was? True love?

365
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,400
You think l used you!
What about you using me?

366
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,700
Everybody uses everybody, don't they?

367
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Hold it, hold it!

368
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,200
- What's this?
- l thought we decided to go downstage.

369
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,600
True, but then l changed it
to the upstage position.

370
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,900
lt was better going downstage.

371
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,400
- Was it?
- Much better.

372
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:11,100
l'll tell you what's even better: you
learn the routine the way l laid it out!

373
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,500
- Again.
- And...five, six, seven, eight.

374
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,100
- What if l come over about nine?
- How do l know you'll show?

375
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,100
- Come on!
- Are you sure you'll be there?

376
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:34,500
- Definitely. We'll go out.
- What, Christmas carolling?

377
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,700
How did you know?

378
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,000
All right! l'll see you later.

379
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:44,400
- No talking to strangers.
- Nobody's stranger than you. See you.

380
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,900
Tony. l'm having
a few friends around tonight.

381
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,900
A pre-Christmas party.
Like to come?

382
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,400
Didn't we just have a fight?

383
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,100
We didn't have a fight, Tony,
you did.

384
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:04,100
l hope that's all resolved
and l'd like to see you.

385
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,500
- What time?
- Oh, ten-ish.

386
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:11,800
- l don't know.
- Consider yourself officially invited.

387
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,100
- Whose limo is this?
- l'll see you about ten.

388
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,200
Bye.

389
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,000
Whose limo is this?

390
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,500
Anybody know whose limo this is?

391
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,700
You know, l don't care
if l ever get a message.

392
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:15,600
- Where to?
- Laura Revell's place, where else?

393
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,900
Are you expected?

394
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,100
To do what?

395
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,500
l was wondering where you were.
You look nice.

396
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,300
- You do, too.
- Thank you.

397
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,000
What would you like to drink?
We have champagne, wine, whisky...

398
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,000
- l don't believe this.
- What?

399
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,300
- Now you're with the director.
- l'm not with anybody.

400
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:30,200
- Haven't you learnt anything?
- What do you mean? Are we in school?

401
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,800
Why don't we go out
on the balcony?

402
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:36,600
There's an awfully nice view
of New York. Come on.

403
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,700
lf you want to leave, that's
your choice. Maybe you had better go.

404
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,800
- What's your problem?
- What?

405
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,800
Do you think
you can play with people?

406
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,400
Do you? Oh, look, Tony.

407
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:04,700
l'm not playing with anyone. l invited
you because l think you're interesting.

408
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,500
Most people here are interesting.

409
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:12,100
- Why be upset? There are pretty girls.
- l came to be with you!

410
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,600
And l'm expecting someone else.

411
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:20,400
Why did we even start this thing up,
huh?

412
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,900
Start?
Look, you came to me, remember?

413
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,400
- You did nothing? lt was just me.
- Whatever.

414
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,300
Anyway, l'm freezing out here.

415
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:38,900
lf nothing else, you'll have
an interesting chapter for your diary.

416
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,200
You know the way out.

417
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,500
Merry Christmas.

418
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,400
l can`t take all the blame now, can l?

419
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:15,800
lt takes more than one
to lose such a fine line

420
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,100
That lies between
but holds together

421
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,300
Hearts in the night

422
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,500
Touch at a time

423
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:32,700
And l`m finding out the hard way

424
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:35,800
lt`s going to take some tears

425
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,200
A little bit of heartache

426
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,500
We`re like islands in the stream

427
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:49,000
Watching all our dreams start to fade

428
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,300
Fading away

429
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:58,600
A moment gone is gone forever

430
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:04,000
lt`s like water through your hands

431
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:10,200
And you spin the wheel of misfortune

432
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:14,100
Watching it turn

433
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:17,100
You live and you learn

434
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,200
l keep reaching out

435
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,300
And come up empty-handed

436
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,700
When did l let you down?

437
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,500
Or did l leave you stranded?

438
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:33,600
And l`m finding out the hard way

439
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,700
lt`s going to take some tears

440
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,800
A little bit of heartache

441
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,300
And we`re like islands in the stream

442
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:49,600
Watching all our dreams start to fade

443
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,600
Fading away

444
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,000
Start to fade

445
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,000
Fading away

446
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,200
Start to fade

447
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,900
Fading away

448
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:09,600
Fade away

449
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,900
- Jackie, l'm sorry.
- l don't want to see you tonight.

450
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:36,100
l just forgot to call you.
l'm really sorry.

451
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,200
l know, but you can't
treat me like this any more.

452
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:43,100
- l won't.
- l can't always be second choice.

453
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:46,100
- You're not.
- l am, and you know l am.

454
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:49,200
l promise it'll never happen again.

455
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:53,100
Yes, it will.
lt will if l let it.

456
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,300
Do you know how many times
you've done this to me?

457
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:02,700
l love you so much, Tony.
Don't you know that?

458
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:05,800
You keep treating me like this.

459
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,400
- What can l say to you? l...
- Nothing.

460
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,000
You don't have to say anything.

461
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,500
l'll be your friend,
but no more than that.

462
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:30,100
- Can l get you something else?
- No, l'm full.

463
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:35,000
- Have another piece of pie.
- No, really, l'm full now, Mom.

464
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:39,000
Come on, have another piece.
l made it special.

465
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,200
OK, the hell with it, then.

466
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,600
Put it away, have it for lunch,
who knows?

467
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,300
You know, it's weird...

468
00:52:55,900 --> 00:53:00,800
This house seems so much smaller
than when l used to live in it.

469
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,300
What do you mean, smaller?

470
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:08,000
You know, the opposite of bigger.
Smaller.

471
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:13,200
l mean, what do you want me to do?
What do you want, stretch it?

472
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,500
l was just making an observation,
that's all.

473
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,800
Tony, why did you come today?

474
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:29,000
- l've got a lot of things on my mind.
- Like what? What things?

475
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:35,000
The way l used to act around here.
l was very hard on you.

476
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,000
And l just wanted to say
it's not me, all right?

477
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:41,800
That wasn't me.

478
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,200
- Are you kidding me?
- No, l'm apologising to you.

479
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:52,500
Apologising for what? Are you saying
that wasn't the real you back then?

480
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,700
Yeah.

481
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:58,500
l had a lot of attitude
and l just didn't like it...

482
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,500
- l don't believe this.
- Believe it!

483
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:07,400
l don't believe it!
And don't get fresh with me!

484
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:11,400
This attitude you're talking about...

485
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:15,800
That's what got you out
of this damn neighbourhood.

486
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,400
You don't need to apologise.
You must have done something right.

487
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,200
So you're saying
l've always been this bastard,

488
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:31,300
but it's all right
because it comes natural to me?

489
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,900
- Something like that.
- Yeah?

490
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,500
Yeah! Yeah. Double yeah.

491
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:48,200
l'll have another piece of this pie.
lt's very good.

492
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,000
Better than stuff l get in New York.

493
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,000
l bought you a ticket for the show.
26 bucks.

494
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,700
l'm a hot shot now.

495
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:20,000
Lay back, Butler.
Extend! Extend!

496
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,100
Enough!

497
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:32,600
Maybe it's me, Butler. Maybe l'm not
getting across what l want.

498
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,700
You still ticklish, huh?

499
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:43,100
What l want is a much more
forceful type movement.

500
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,100
- lt's a very sensual show, Butler.
- Right.

501
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:54,600
So, let's try to be sensual.
Try it. You might like it.

502
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:59,200
Once again.

503
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,000
- What do you think?
- She's good.

504
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:09,500
- What about him?
- He's good, but he's too mechanical.

505
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:20,100
- What are you doing later?
- l've got commitments.

506
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,500
- You do?
- Yeah, l do.

507
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:25,900
- You don't.
- You don't think l have other plans?

508
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,600
- No.
- Well, you're wrong.

509
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,700
- l can tell when you're lying.
- How?

510
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:36,300
- How can you tell when l'm lying?
- Who's your commitment with?

511
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,600
l'll never tell.

512
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,700
l'll go out with you.

513
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,700
- Excuse me?
- The three of us.

514
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,000
Oh, you're sick.
You are sick.

515
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,700
No, really, later?

516
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,200
l don't know what you did,
but she hates me.

517
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,900
- l didn't do nothing.
- Come on, Tony, stop lying.

518
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,900
l mean, it's becoming
a regular thing with you.

519
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:23,200
- That bad, huh?
- That bad.

520
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:30,900
- So what are we doing here?
- l wanted to ask you a favour.

521
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:34,200
- What favour?
- Could you meet me here tonight?

522
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:39,200
- No, l don't think l can.
- l will owe you for life if you do.

523
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,500
l know l treat you bad
and l got terrible manners.

524
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:47,500
But so did the people l grew up with.
Some of it rubs off.

525
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:53,300
There's a gentleman inside here
dying to get out. Really.

526
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,600
Come on, would you?

527
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:59,800
Please. How about it?

528
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,300
- OK.
- Thank you.

529
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,600
You're welcome.

530
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:39,500
- l didn't think you were showing up.
- l'm sorry. The show ran late.

531
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:43,700
- Tony, you remember Carl. Carl, Tony.
- How are you doing?

532
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,400
- l need to ask you something.
- Me, too.

533
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:51,800
That guy's a musician. l didn't think
you was the musician type.

534
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:57,900
- He plays rhythm guitar at the club.
- Rhythm guitar? That's the worst!

535
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:03,100
Everybody knows you can't trust a guy
who plays rhythm guitar.

536
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:08,200
Underneath the curls, he's a pervert.
l can feel it.

537
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,100
Did you take funny pills today?

538
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,600
- How did you get in here?
- The window.

539
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,500
- You amaze me.
- l don't like him.

540
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:21,600
- Looks like a demented paratrooper.
- He is just a friend!

541
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:25,500
- Listen, thanks, Carl.
- ls everything all right?

542
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:29,400
- Fine. She's in good hands.
- Are you Allstate, pal?

543
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,600
- Yeah, you want disability?
- l'll see you Wednesday.

544
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:36,300
- All right. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

545
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,700
Did you see
how you said goodnight to him?

546
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:47,200
Oh, great!
No, how did l say it?

547
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:51,900
lt was like syrup.
l got a cavity just listening to it.

548
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,400
What are we doing here?

549
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,400
l want to...
l want to try Butler's routine.

550
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,700
l want to ask Jesse
to have a shot at replacing him.

551
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,000
- You're kidding?
- No. You think l can do it?

552
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:13,600
- l think so.
- Well...do you want to help me?

553
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,300
- l think so.
- Let's go.

554
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,900
- l think you're a little jealous.
- No way.

555
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,900
- Walk you home?
- No, it's OK.

556
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:42,000
- Sure?
- Positive. Thanks anyway.

557
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:45,200
All right.
Thanks a lot, Jackie.

558
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:48,400
You're welcome. Goodnight.

559
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:57,700
Hey, Jackie! Remember l mentioned a
gentleman that was anxious to get out?

560
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:01,400
- Well, he'd like to walk you home.
- OK.

561
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:04,500
You're lucky.
This neighbourhood is dangerous.

562
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,900
- You didn't give that musician a key?
- No!

563
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:13,400
- Did you?
- No!

564
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,600
Just checking.

565
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:23,100
- So what do you think?
- No, it's what you think.

566
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:26,900
- You think l ought to try it?
- You've got the routine.

567
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:30,300
- But is it good enough?
- Yeah.

568
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:33,500
- ls it?
- Yeah. Well... Goodnight.

569
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:35,700
Goodnight, Jackie.

570
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,700
Hey, Jackie, wait a minute.

571
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:45,200
l want to say something to you,
but it's really hard because...

572
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:49,400
l'm just not used to saying
nice things to you.

573
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:57,100
l think we had something
really comfortable, right.

574
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,400
Something really...really nice.

575
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:03,500
And l was thinking
that l was really...

576
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:07,000
The way l acted towards you
was really wrong.

577
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,800
l don't want to lose you.

578
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:17,800
l feel really comfortable with you
and l was thinking

579
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,500
that if you feel the same way,
and l feel the same thing for you,

580
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:25,800
then maybe we could
get back together.

581
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
l love you, Jackie.

582
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:53,400
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

583
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:56,700
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

584
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,600
Three, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

585
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,700
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

586
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,500
- Two, two, three, four...
- Hold it, hold it!

587
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,900
Take a break.

588
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,700
- lt's not me, is it?
- Nope. You're fine.

589
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:04,700
- l think l can do it.
- Do what?

590
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:08,600
- You're being unreasonable!
- l won't jeopardise my career...

591
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,200
- Nor will l.
- He's an amateur!

592
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:15,800
- l want you to try it with him!
- You've been taken in...

593
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:21,300
l haven't. Now try it, and keep your
personal feelings out of it! Let's go.

594
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,600
OK.

595
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:30,300
- Butler, sit this one out.
- What do you mean?

596
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,400
- You know.
- l don't!

597
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:35,300
Sure, you do!
Manero!

598
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:46,800
You know the first combination.

599
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,300
Music.

600
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,700
ls this a dance
or a bloody circus?

601
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,700
- Forget it, man!
- Too right!

602
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:38,100
What are you looking at?

603
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:44,000
- Wait!
- l don't want to talk about it.

604
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,200
Don't walk out
and expect to come back!

605
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:49,700
- ls that right?
- You walk out now, you're over!

606
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:53,600
- What would you do?
- l'm not the one who's on the line.

607
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:59,900
- l don't want anybody laughing at me!
- Who are you, somebody special?

608
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:04,000
l give you a chance
for a Broadway lead and you walk out!

609
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,900
- Who cares?
- Nobody has to care!

610
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:10,800
l don't have to care about you,
or you about me.

611
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:16,700
lf you want to dance here, you follow
my rules! lt's not a democracy!

612
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:20,100
You are not the greatest dancer
to hit Broadway!

613
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:25,600
You have anger and intensity. That's
what l need to make this show work.

614
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:29,600
You think you're so terrific
you'll score another show?

615
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:32,700
The best thing that you ever scored
is Laura.

616
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,400
But you blew that because
you're different kinds of people.

617
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,500
You're never going to change that.

618
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:45,700
lf you had half a brain, you'd stop
trying to change other people

619
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:49,600
and start worrying
about changing yourself!

620
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:55,300
- Everyone uses everyone, don't they?
- Go to hell, Manero!

621
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,500
Who cares, man?

622
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:10,000
All right, starting positions.

623
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:12,500
And...five, six, seven, eight.

624
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:16,200
- One, two, three, four, five...
- Hold it!

625
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:32,100
- Butler, would you mind?
- This is bullshit!

626
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:48,000
- Count it down.
- And five, six, seven, eight.

627
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:01,000
Again!

628
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:17,400
Yes!

629
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,800
Again, Tony, again!

630
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:47,000
Five minutes!

631
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:56,900
Five minutes!

632
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:01,500
Five minutes!

633
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,400
Full house, kids.

634
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:13,900
How are you feeling?
l just want to tell you one thing.

635
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:17,800
When you step out there,
remember you're not one of them.

636
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:21,600
You dance for them.
Don't dance for yourself, Tony.

637
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:25,600
The show will work,
you'll be terrific.

638
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:27,800
- You warmed up?
- Yep.

639
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,500
- Break a leg.
- Thanks a lot.

640
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:35,100
How about you, warmed up?
How do you feel?

641
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:38,800
- Nervous.
- Of course you are. You look good.

642
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,400
You know what l need?
Another week.

643
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,900
You're going to be great!
l've got to go.

644
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:51,400
All right.

645
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:05,100
My son is in this show.

646
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,300
ln case you didn't know.

647
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:12,000
He's a dancer, my son.
He's very good.

648
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,900
Spots four and five,
standing by.

649
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:19,600
Standing room only, guys.
How are we doing?

650
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:21,100
We're ready.

651
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:24,300
- Black out the curtain warmers.
- Curtain warmers to black.

652
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:34,500
- They're out.
- Give me a white spot.

653
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,500
Spot is go.

654
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:52,800
Hang on there, Manero,

655
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,400
Perfect!

656
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:27,300
Go to black!

657
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:32,200
You bastard!

658
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:47,100
Why don't you teach him
some manners?

659
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:52,000
- How is the show going?
- Great. How's your eye?

660
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:57,000
- How was that last scene?
- Wonderful. Honey, you were great.

661
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:01,800
- But why did you have to kiss her?
- Oh, God, that didn't mean nothing.

662
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:13,800
Jesus.

663
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:31,400
Good luck!

664
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:35,700
- Manero! What are you doing out there?
- l'm dancing.

665
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:41,200
That's a personal war you're having!
Out there, you two are dancers.

666
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:46,200
You want to fight, do it on your own
time! The show is the thing, not you!

667
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:49,900
- You remember that!
- l'll remember that.

668
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:38,200
Tony! Tony!

669
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:42,000
- l don't know what came over me.
- lt was nothing. Forget it.

670
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:46,400
- Could we get together after the show?
- Why?

671
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:50,200
l just want to talk, clear things up.

672
01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:56,300
l've got other commitments.

673
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:59,100
Oh, Tony!

674
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:01,900
- Just one more thing.
- What?

675
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:05,700
You don't have it.

676
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,300
Come on, let's go!

677
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:46,400
Tony! What are you doing?

678
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:48,600
Put me down!

679
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:58,800
l didn't tell him to do a solo!

680
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:40,400
Come on!
Come on!

681

Come on!

685
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:16,700
Where did he learn to do this?

686
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:42,000
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Goodnight. Got to go!

687
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:45,900
- Where are you going?
- lf l don't get out, l'll explode.
