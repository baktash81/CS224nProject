1
00:00:40,938 --> 00:00:42,661
<i>Basic principles:</i>

2
00:00:42,762 --> 00:00:44,737
<i>No woman wakes up saying:</i>

3
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:47,872
<i>"God, I hope I don't get
swept off my feet today. "</i>

4
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,040
<i>Now, she might say,
"This is a really bad time for me. "</i>

5
00:00:57,226 --> 00:01:01,252
<i>Or something like, "I just need some space. "</i>

6
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:05,251
<i>Or my personal favorite:</i>

7
00:01:05,386 --> 00:01:07,971
<i>"I'm really into my career right now. "</i>

8
00:01:10,986 --> 00:01:13,407
You believe that? Neither does she.

9
00:01:13,578 --> 00:01:17,287
You know why?
Because she's lying to you, that's why.

10
00:01:17,962 --> 00:01:20,417
You understand me? Lying.

11
00:01:21,226 --> 00:01:24,804
It's not a bad time for her.
She doesn't need any space.

12
00:01:24,938 --> 00:01:26,726
She may be into her career...

13
00:01:26,858 --> 00:01:30,371
but what she's really saying is,
"Get away from me now. "

14
00:01:30,762 --> 00:01:33,217
Or possibly, "Try harder, stupid. "

15
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,828
Well, which one is it?

16
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,989
<i>60% of all human communication
is nonverbal.</i>

17
00:01:42,346 --> 00:01:43,775
<i>Body language.</i>

18
00:01:43,882 --> 00:01:45,824
<i>30% is your tone.</i>

19
00:01:46,378 --> 00:01:49,891
<i>So that means that
90% of what you're saying...</i>

20
00:01:50,122 --> 00:01:52,391
ain't coming out of your mouth.

21
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,290
Toby!

22
00:01:57,802 --> 00:01:58,817
Shit!

23
00:01:58,922 --> 00:02:00,166
Of course she'll lie to you.

24
00:02:00,298 --> 00:02:02,948
She's a nice person,
she doesn't wanna hurt your feelings.

25
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,570
What else is she gonna say?
She doesn't even know you.

26
00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:06,720
Yet.

27
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,167
<i>Luckily, the fact is
that just like the rest of us...</i>

28
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:16,488
<i>even a beautiful woman doesn't know
what she wants until she sees it.</i>

29
00:02:16,746 --> 00:02:18,339
<i>And that's where I come in.</i>

30
00:02:18,442 --> 00:02:20,547
<i>My job is to open her eyes.</i>

31
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,231
Oh, my God!

32
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:30,239
Is this what you're looking for?

33
00:02:30,378 --> 00:02:34,087
Basic principles: No matter what,
no matter when, no matter who...

34
00:02:34,218 --> 00:02:37,567
any man has a chance
to sweep any woman off her feet.

35
00:02:37,962 --> 00:02:39,685
Just needs the right broom.

36
00:02:48,778 --> 00:02:50,949
You cannot use what you do not have.

37
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,919
So if you're shy, be shy.
If you're outgoing, be outgoing.

38
00:02:54,057 --> 00:02:56,392
- I'm not outgoing.
- That's okay.

39
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,806
She may not want the whole truth,
but she does want the real you.

40
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:03,175
She may not want to see it all at once,
but she does want to see it.

41
00:03:03,306 --> 00:03:07,910
So tonight, when you're wondering what
to say, how you look, or if she likes you...

42
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,857
just remember, she is already out with you.

43
00:03:11,177 --> 00:03:15,171
That means she said yes
when she could have said no.

44
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:19,144
That means she made a plan
when she could have just blown you off.

45
00:03:19,274 --> 00:03:23,168
So that means it is no longer your job
to try to make her like you.

46
00:03:23,305 --> 00:03:26,120
It is your job not to mess it up.

47
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,745
The shoes are hot.
You went to the place I told you?

48
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:36,192
Yeah, but I don't think they're really me.

49
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:39,878
"You" is a very fluid concept right now.

50
00:03:39,977 --> 00:03:43,392
You bought the shoes.
You look great in the shoes.

51
00:03:43,498 --> 00:03:45,221
That's the you I'm talking about.

52
00:03:47,946 --> 00:03:50,597
<i>The key tonight is hang back.</i>

53
00:03:51,594 --> 00:03:53,536
<i>Give her plenty of space.</i>

54
00:03:54,185 --> 00:03:57,055
<i>If she lingers at a photograph, move on.</i>

55
00:03:58,954 --> 00:04:00,863
<i>But maintain the visual.</i>

56
00:04:04,618 --> 00:04:09,222
<i>It's supposed to be 64 and clear tonight.
So when you leave the club, walk a little.</i>

57
00:04:09,354 --> 00:04:11,558
<i>Ask her what she thought about the show...</i>

58
00:04:11,657 --> 00:04:14,275
<i>what was her favorite photograph,
why that one.</i>

59
00:04:14,378 --> 00:04:17,640
<i>And when she answers,
don't be looking at her mouth.</i>

60
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:20,291
<i>Don't be wondering
what she looks like naked.</i>

61
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,742
Listen to what she is saying and respond.

62
00:04:24,137 --> 00:04:26,526
Listen and respond.

63
00:04:27,177 --> 00:04:28,901
<i>That way, when it's your turn to talk...</i>

64
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:31,816
<i>you'll have something better to say than,
"I like your mouth. "</i>

65
00:04:31,946 --> 00:04:34,117
What was your favorite one?

66
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,897
The elephant, definitely.

67
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:39,586
<i>And all of a sudden,
we're on date number two.</i>

68
00:04:43,274 --> 00:04:44,386
Ready.

69
00:04:50,154 --> 00:04:51,299
No way.

70
00:04:52,937 --> 00:04:55,872
We're going back in there.
You have to smile.

71
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:59,617
In case you didn't go to high school,
hitting is a good thing.

72
00:04:59,754 --> 00:05:02,176
<i>So how does it happen, great love?</i>

73
00:05:02,314 --> 00:05:03,296
Are you okay?

74
00:05:03,434 --> 00:05:04,994
<i>- Nobody knows.
- I'm good.</i>

75
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:08,294
Let me get a Bomb Pop
and a Screwball for the lady.

76
00:05:08,426 --> 00:05:12,517
<i>But what I can tell you,
is that it happens in the blink of an eye.</i>

77
00:05:14,794 --> 00:05:17,183
<i>One moment, you're enjoying your life.</i>

78
00:05:17,353 --> 00:05:21,314
<i>And the next, you're wondering
how you ever lived without them.</i>

79
00:05:22,505 --> 00:05:24,513
<i>Three dates is all I need.</i>

80
00:05:25,098 --> 00:05:28,894
<i>Three dates, and I'll get you here,
to the high-stakes medal round...</i>

81
00:05:29,034 --> 00:05:31,903
<i>where eight out of 10 women
believe that the first kiss...</i>

82
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:35,719
<i>will tell them everything they need to know
about the relationship.</i>

83
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,311
<i>After that, you're on your own.</i>

84
00:06:06,954 --> 00:06:08,743
<i>But always remember...</i>

85
00:06:09,066 --> 00:06:11,935
<i>life is not the amount of breaths you take.</i>

86
00:06:13,545 --> 00:06:16,448
<i>It's the moments that take your breath away.</i>

87
00:06:20,617 --> 00:06:22,854
Did I call it or did I call it?

88
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,057
I mean, what did I say, six months?

89
00:06:25,194 --> 00:06:26,852
And when was her first date?

90
00:06:26,985 --> 00:06:29,855
So five-and-a-half?
God, I hate it when I'm right.

91
00:06:29,994 --> 00:06:33,474
What is it about guys that makes them
want to screw anything that walks...

92
00:06:33,578 --> 00:06:36,774
even when they're going out with
someone as awesome as Allegra Cole?

93
00:06:36,906 --> 00:06:39,557
She's only the most fabulous thing
walking around New York.

94
00:06:39,657 --> 00:06:40,672
Thanks, Young.

95
00:06:40,777 --> 00:06:42,981
Are you kidding?
Of course I'm gonna run it.

96
00:06:43,145 --> 00:06:46,374
Why should she waste her heart
on some Swedish aristo-brat?

97
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,393
Even if he is gorgeous.

98
00:06:48,745 --> 00:06:50,152
If he's stupid enough to cheat...

99
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,584
the world should know
he's dumb enough to get caught.

100
00:06:52,714 --> 00:06:55,015
Exactly. I'm in the elevator.
See you in a minute.

101
00:06:55,146 --> 00:06:57,186
Good morning, how are you?

102
00:06:57,514 --> 00:06:59,270
Bitter, party of one.

103
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:01,796
You should try it sometime.

104
00:07:01,897 --> 00:07:05,029
Barbados by myself?
I wouldn't last five minutes.

105
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:06,853
It was just what the doctor ordered.

106
00:07:06,985 --> 00:07:10,301
I slept in, I did my yoga,
I read a couple of books...

107
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,035
flirted with my scuba instructor.

108
00:07:12,137 --> 00:07:15,104
- And apparently never left the office.
- I know, isn't that great?

109
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,250
You should've taken someone with you.

110
00:07:17,386 --> 00:07:19,426
Who am I gonna take with me?

111
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:21,701
This is where a boyfriend comes in handy.

112
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:26,111
- I don't have time for a boyfriend.
- You said that two years ago.

113
00:07:26,218 --> 00:07:29,065
Yes, and it's as true today as it was then.

114
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,010
I thought you were on vacation.

115
00:07:31,145 --> 00:07:34,342
See if these are in focus
and have them in my desk in an hour.

116
00:07:34,473 --> 00:07:38,663
Besides, relationships are for people
waiting for something better to come along.

117
00:07:38,794 --> 00:07:40,997
Spoken like a true cynic.

118
00:07:41,353 --> 00:07:43,142
I'm not a cynic. I'm a realist.

119
00:07:43,273 --> 00:07:47,551
You are a realist masquerading as a cynic
who is secretly an optimist.

120
00:07:47,657 --> 00:07:50,177
What are you doing here?
What is she doing here?

121
00:07:50,314 --> 00:07:51,775
She works here, remember?

122
00:07:51,913 --> 00:07:54,434
No, she doesn't. Not for another four days.

123
00:07:54,537 --> 00:07:56,261
- This couldn't wait.
- It could.

124
00:07:56,394 --> 00:07:58,182
What are you doing? Go back to the beach.

125
00:07:58,314 --> 00:08:01,031
- I don't want you here.
- No, really, you do.

126
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:04,031
You are becoming
a sick, workaholic lunatic...

127
00:08:04,137 --> 00:08:05,763
and this is exactly...

128
00:08:05,865 --> 00:08:09,859
the kind of nervous, overwrought behavior
that leads to...

129
00:08:09,993 --> 00:08:12,710
Pictures of Sebby with a busty brunette.

130
00:08:13,002 --> 00:08:15,620
A very big raise.

131
00:08:15,817 --> 00:08:19,079
Jesus. You could find dirt in a snowstorm.

132
00:08:19,657 --> 00:08:21,032
Comes with the job.

133
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:25,634
You know, kiddo, there is more to life
than watching other people live it.

134
00:08:26,186 --> 00:08:28,422
Can I help he was cheating on my beach?

135
00:08:28,553 --> 00:08:30,975
I think it's great
that you're so good at your job.

136
00:08:31,113 --> 00:08:33,633
I'm just a little worried as to why.

137
00:08:35,017 --> 00:08:36,959
Let me worry about that.

138
00:08:37,322 --> 00:08:40,191
Okay. I want that column on my desk
by lunch.

139
00:08:40,298 --> 00:08:41,607
So you'll pay for my hotel?

140
00:08:41,706 --> 00:08:45,001
For you to sip mai tais?
I don't think so. Get out.

141
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:58,343
- Come on.
- What?

142
00:08:58,474 --> 00:08:59,848
- That's good, right?
- No.

143
00:08:59,946 --> 00:09:01,472
No, it was in and it freaked out.

144
00:09:01,577 --> 00:09:05,439
You know what your problem is, Hitch?
You're all about the short game.

145
00:09:06,985 --> 00:09:10,149
You pick your shots
based on what you see first...

146
00:09:10,537 --> 00:09:13,669
not what's necessarily best for you...

147
00:09:14,793 --> 00:09:16,354
in the long run.

148
00:09:17,097 --> 00:09:21,287
All of us are not married to the woman
of our dreams and about to have a baby.

149
00:09:21,385 --> 00:09:24,800
You know, I'm very happy for you.
Just not meant for everybody.

150
00:09:24,906 --> 00:09:27,720
So please just leave me to my hot, sweaty...

151
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,916
totally varied, wildly experimental
short game.

152
00:09:31,786 --> 00:09:34,950
- I was talking about pool, but whatever.
- Yeah, okay.

153
00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:37,699
Honestly, I just hope one day
you're able to experience...

154
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:41,379
the unconditional love, trust,
and openness...

155
00:09:41,513 --> 00:09:43,302
that I share with Grace every single day.

156
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:46,914
- Is this really barroom talk?
- You need to listen to me. I'm serious.

157
00:09:47,017 --> 00:09:49,603
Because when you get to a place
with a woman like that...

158
00:09:49,705 --> 00:09:51,461
it's so beyond anything physical that...

159
00:09:51,594 --> 00:09:54,147
when I think back to
when I used to run around with you...

160
00:09:54,281 --> 00:09:57,128
<i>and chase all these really gorgeous
but shallow women...</i>

161
00:09:57,257 --> 00:10:01,992
I don't know, it's kind of ridiculous
and vaguely pathetic.

162
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:11,743
Yeah, I see what you mean. That's pathetic.

163
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:17,351
So, how'd you meet him?

164
00:10:17,481 --> 00:10:20,263
I was in La Perla
just buying some weekend thongs.

165
00:10:20,394 --> 00:10:22,815
- And he was doing likewise?
- No.

166
00:10:23,274 --> 00:10:26,089
Actually, he said he was buying something
for his mom.

167
00:10:26,185 --> 00:10:27,429
His mom?

168
00:10:27,722 --> 00:10:30,275
Casey, who buys high-priced lingerie
for their mother?

169
00:10:30,377 --> 00:10:32,581
Well, maybe he was looking for a robe.

170
00:10:32,905 --> 00:10:37,062
Casey, he was hitting on you while
he was buying lingerie for another woman.

171
00:10:38,057 --> 00:10:41,538
- I prefer the mother story.
- I know you do, but that's not the point.

172
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:44,804
No, the point is I'm not gonna start out
assuming the guy's a liar.

173
00:10:44,905 --> 00:10:47,425
<i>- Why not?
- Because that's how you wind up...</i>

174
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:50,624
Like me? Is that what you were gonna say?

175
00:10:50,762 --> 00:10:53,129
No. I was gonna say, "Like you. "

176
00:10:53,513 --> 00:10:55,368
- What's his name?
- Why?

177
00:10:55,785 --> 00:10:58,119
- I'm gonna Google him.
- No. Google your own guy.

178
00:10:58,217 --> 00:11:00,105
Let's just see if his mother's still alive.

179
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:03,048
- So when is Grace due again?
- Soon.

180
00:11:03,465 --> 00:11:05,920
- You excited?
- What'd you say?

181
00:11:06,218 --> 00:11:08,705
Do you want me to go get them
and bring them over here?

182
00:11:08,842 --> 00:11:09,954
No, don't do that.

183
00:11:10,058 --> 00:11:13,920
Are you saying you don't wanna talk to them
because you can't go home with them?

184
00:11:14,025 --> 00:11:16,164
I'm just trying to keep my head above water.

185
00:11:16,265 --> 00:11:18,884
- Have you heard of the Date Doctor?
- Urban myth.

186
00:11:18,985 --> 00:11:20,196
- Really?
- Absolutely.

187
00:11:20,297 --> 00:11:21,858
I was hoping he also helped women.

188
00:11:21,993 --> 00:11:24,895
Casey, you're not sick. You're single.

189
00:11:25,162 --> 00:11:27,398
You just have to relax and enjoy the ride.

190
00:11:27,497 --> 00:11:29,635
I haven't been ridden in months.

191
00:11:32,585 --> 00:11:37,342
On that happy note, I'm gonna go see
if anybody interesting came in tonight.

192
00:11:37,481 --> 00:11:39,586
- You mean, besides me.
- Right.

193
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:41,150
Bye.

194
00:11:41,257 --> 00:11:43,559
I'll go get those girls,
bring them over here...

195
00:11:43,658 --> 00:11:45,796
and we'll have a conversation
like human beings.

196
00:11:45,897 --> 00:11:49,475
Then you're gonna home,
and I'll take them back to my apartment.

197
00:11:49,577 --> 00:11:53,854
Well, that sounds like fun for me.
But you might want to get in line, pal.

198
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:56,743
- Hey, girl.
- Hey, how are you?

199
00:11:58,441 --> 00:12:02,467
Hey, baby, can I get a couple Coronas
at the pool table, please? Thanks.

200
00:12:02,602 --> 00:12:03,911
Excuse me.

201
00:12:06,473 --> 00:12:08,229
Lime wedges in the bottle's fine.

202
00:12:08,362 --> 00:12:10,631
Hey, asshole, I don't work here.

203
00:12:14,761 --> 00:12:19,496
I'm sorry. The paramedics will have to come
to get my foot out of my mouth, sweetheart.

204
00:12:19,593 --> 00:12:21,797
Just don't let it happen again.

205
00:12:21,929 --> 00:12:24,351
- I knew you didn't work here.
- You did?

206
00:12:24,489 --> 00:12:27,805
How else was I supposed to get you away
from all those guys?

207
00:12:28,489 --> 00:12:30,693
Why would you want to do that?

208
00:12:31,145 --> 00:12:34,441
<i>Some guys naturally develop a comfort
with the opposite sex.</i>

209
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:38,310
<i>They like women, women like them.
Everything flows naturally.</i>

210
00:12:39,113 --> 00:12:42,528
<i>Back in college, I was just not one of them.</i>

211
00:12:46,793 --> 00:12:49,608
<i>I seemed to lack the basic understanding...</i>

212
00:12:49,705 --> 00:12:52,160
<i>that my peers just intuitively grasped.</i>

213
00:12:52,265 --> 00:12:56,641
<i>But like any late bloomer,
I was eager to make up for lost time.</i>

214
00:12:59,402 --> 00:13:02,369
<i>Her name was Cressida Baylor.</i>

215
00:13:03,305 --> 00:13:06,305
Can you tell me
where the registration building is?

216
00:13:09,673 --> 00:13:12,007
<i>And my life would never be the same.</i>

217
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:14,472
- I'm Alex.
- Cressida.

218
00:13:17,705 --> 00:13:19,974
<i>What we had was beautiful.</i>

219
00:13:25,545 --> 00:13:26,887
I love you.

220
00:13:29,545 --> 00:13:31,236
I love you so much.

221
00:13:32,233 --> 00:13:33,989
I love you, too, Alex.

222
00:13:40,105 --> 00:13:43,040
I know you don't love me
as much as I love you.

223
00:13:43,145 --> 00:13:46,855
But that's okay.
I'm just glad you love me at all.

224
00:13:46,953 --> 00:13:50,149
<i>In retrospect,
I guess I may have come on a little strong.</i>

225
00:13:54,185 --> 00:13:56,487
<i>But the experience taught me a lot.</i>

226
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,829
Cressida!

227
00:14:01,545 --> 00:14:03,171
What are you doing?

228
00:14:03,273 --> 00:14:04,614
I'm sorry, Alex.

229
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:08,936
But I love you. What did I do wrong?
Just tell me what I did wrong.

230
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:11,103
You're doing it right now.

231
00:14:12,073 --> 00:14:13,633
Alex, I'm sorry.

232
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:21,091
<i>And it's an education
I feel obliged to pass on to my fellow men.</i>

233
00:14:24,842 --> 00:14:28,802
<i>Because with no guile and no game,
there's no girl.</i>

234
00:14:30,153 --> 00:14:31,713
<i>If ever a man born was without game...</i>

235
00:14:33,225 --> 00:14:35,200
<i>it was Albert Brennaman.</i>

236
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:04,294
<i>My business is 100% referral
and, thus far, untraceable.</i>

237
00:15:04,393 --> 00:15:06,149
<i>And if there's one thing I've learned...</i>

238
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:09,826
<i>when you orchestrate, coordinate,
and otherwise mess with fate...</i>

239
00:15:09,961 --> 00:15:12,328
<i>it's best to fly under the radar.</i>

240
00:15:48,841 --> 00:15:51,110
I hope she's single
'cause I don't do break-ups.

241
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,129
Hi. Thank you for seeing me.

242
00:15:53,225 --> 00:15:56,541
Yeah, no.
I mean, she just got out of a relationship.

243
00:15:57,001 --> 00:15:59,903
Is that a problem?
Because if it is, that's fine.

244
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,245
I'm a little uncomfortable with this anyway.

245
00:16:02,345 --> 00:16:06,404
Definitely been hurt a lot.
I had a lot of bad experiences.

246
00:16:06,505 --> 00:16:09,821
Some good ones.
But definitely a lot of bad ones.

247
00:16:10,505 --> 00:16:14,433
I'm desperate, basically.
I mean, not in general, you understand?

248
00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:18,115
<i>You know, not just for anybody.
But, man, for her... Yeah.</i>

249
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:20,838
Why don't you tell me about her?

250
00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:23,969
Let's see, what can I say?

251
00:16:24,265 --> 00:16:27,811
My company handles her finances.
I'm her tax consultant.

252
00:16:28,328 --> 00:16:31,492
Well, I'm one of them.
I'm the junior man on the account.

253
00:16:31,593 --> 00:16:33,927
- So does she know you're interested?
- No.

254
00:16:37,928 --> 00:16:39,041
Alive?

255
00:16:40,073 --> 00:16:41,480
I lent her my pen once.

256
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:44,165
Shoot. Does anyone have a pen?

257
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:47,645
- Here, take mine.
- Albert, you're crushing my arm.

258
00:16:47,753 --> 00:16:50,174
Sorry about that. Here you go, Allegra.

259
00:16:53,257 --> 00:16:55,842
Allegra? As in Allegra Cole?

260
00:16:55,977 --> 00:16:58,595
Yeah, I realize that I'm not her usual type.

261
00:16:58,729 --> 00:17:02,373
Well, her last boyfriend owned Sweden
or something.

262
00:17:02,473 --> 00:17:04,131
And that guy was a bum.

263
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:07,168
He didn't seem like
a very nice person to me.

264
00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:10,111
You swing for the fence.

265
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:13,542
Look, you don't think I tried
talking myself out of this?

266
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:17,318
I mean, you don't think I know
how ridiculous this is? I know, okay?

267
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:20,744
<i>I just thought that maybe with your help...</i>

268
00:17:22,729 --> 00:17:26,559
You know what?
I'm really sorry I wasted your time.

269
00:17:37,513 --> 00:17:39,487
Hold on a second, Albert.

270
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:45,857
You know what it's like
getting up every morning feeling hopeless?

271
00:17:46,057 --> 00:17:49,406
Feeling like the love of your life
is waking up with the wrong man?

272
00:17:49,513 --> 00:17:54,215
But at the same time,
hoping that she still finds happiness...

273
00:17:54,697 --> 00:17:57,414
even if it's never gonna be with you?

274
00:17:58,729 --> 00:18:01,412
You are flat-out...

275
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:05,283
out of your mind. You know that?

276
00:18:09,032 --> 00:18:10,407
That's good.

277
00:18:11,497 --> 00:18:12,610
It is?

278
00:18:13,513 --> 00:18:15,782
You ever heard of Michelangelo?

279
00:18:15,881 --> 00:18:18,020
Heard of the Sistine Chapel?

280
00:18:19,497 --> 00:18:20,903
Michelangelo.

281
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:23,295
Sistine Chapel.

282
00:18:23,528 --> 00:18:25,219
You saying you can do this?

283
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:28,736
My name is Alex Hitchens.
Let's go paint that ceiling.

284
00:18:57,032 --> 00:18:58,439
Take it easy.

285
00:18:59,753 --> 00:19:01,128
Oh, my God!

286
00:19:45,128 --> 00:19:47,550
Well, it looks like I'm still rich.

287
00:19:51,048 --> 00:19:55,205
But what I would really like,
and what I was wondering is...

288
00:19:56,456 --> 00:20:00,351
if I could have $500,000
to invest on my own.

289
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:06,209
And what were you thinking
of investing in, Allegra?

290
00:20:07,657 --> 00:20:12,097
Well, it's something
that I really have a passion for.

291
00:20:17,928 --> 00:20:20,165
<i>Daydreams are for private time.</i>

292
00:20:20,489 --> 00:20:22,660
<i>When you're in the room, be in the room.</i>

293
00:20:22,761 --> 00:20:26,241
<i>Concentrate. Focus.
Women respond when you respond to them.</i>

294
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:29,158
My friend Maggie is a talented designer.

295
00:20:29,577 --> 00:20:33,733
I've seen the business plan
and the samples look fantastic.

296
00:20:34,729 --> 00:20:38,657
And I would really like to get involved.

297
00:20:43,081 --> 00:20:44,674
I'll tell you what.

298
00:20:44,808 --> 00:20:49,281
Let us come up with a range of investments
that we think you might be interested in...

299
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:52,864
and next month,
we'll run the whole lot of them by you.

300
00:20:55,849 --> 00:20:56,797
Okay.

301
00:20:56,936 --> 00:20:59,325
Fine. Thank you. All right, gentlemen.

302
00:20:59,849 --> 00:21:02,337
Let's go over this one more time.
What is the objective?

303
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,815
Shock and awe.

304
00:21:03,945 --> 00:21:06,695
That was shockingly awful.
What is the objective?

305
00:21:06,825 --> 00:21:07,938
Shock and awe.

306
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,310
What is the objective?

307
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,764
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, Albert?

308
00:21:21,065 --> 00:21:24,229
I don't really agree with that.

309
00:21:24,329 --> 00:21:26,717
You don't really agree with what?

310
00:21:33,129 --> 00:21:36,390
I think if you want to invest $500,000
in your friend's business...

311
00:21:36,488 --> 00:21:37,917
that's exactly what you should do.

312
00:21:38,056 --> 00:21:40,740
You don't need us to tell you what to do.

313
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,775
We're a board of advisers,
not your kindergarten teachers.

314
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,019
If you want to be taken seriously
as an adult...

315
00:21:46,121 --> 00:21:48,390
then start taking yourself seriously
as an adult...

316
00:21:48,489 --> 00:21:51,336
instead of asking for permission
to invest your own money...

317
00:21:51,465 --> 00:21:54,050
from a boardroom
full of your daddy's golf buddies.

318
00:21:54,184 --> 00:21:55,843
- That's quite enough!
- I'm not finished.

319
00:21:55,977 --> 00:22:00,003
I'd like to see anybody in this room
handle the attention and publicity...

320
00:22:00,136 --> 00:22:03,649
that she's had to deal with her whole life,
with half her class.

321
00:22:05,865 --> 00:22:09,825
We should be taking advice from you,
Miss Cole. Not the other way around.

322
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:12,580
- Sit down...
- No! You know what? I quit!

323
00:22:22,536 --> 00:22:23,846
Oh, my God.

324
00:22:33,577 --> 00:22:36,163
Just breathe. How'd it go?

325
00:22:36,297 --> 00:22:39,679
I yelled at her. I screamed at my boss!
I quit my job!

326
00:22:40,201 --> 00:22:41,892
<i>- What?
- You said...</i>

327
00:22:42,249 --> 00:22:44,704
- I gotta go back.
- No, I didn't tell you to quit.

328
00:22:44,808 --> 00:22:46,499
Relax. Okay, listen, we're fine.

329
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:48,968
- Would you let me go?
- Albert, no!

330
00:22:50,281 --> 00:22:53,030
Just relax! Okay?

331
00:22:53,544 --> 00:22:56,773
- Just let it marinate for a second. Trust me.
- No!

332
00:23:06,665 --> 00:23:08,607
Relax.

333
00:23:08,745 --> 00:23:10,785
- It's Allegra Cole.
- Answer it.

334
00:23:10,888 --> 00:23:14,304
- Could I speak to you a second?
- Answer the door, Albert.

335
00:23:18,568 --> 00:23:19,779
Yes. Hi.

336
00:23:20,521 --> 00:23:21,863
What's up?

337
00:23:22,185 --> 00:23:24,007
Listen, Albert, right?

338
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:29,544
- People don't usually talk to me like that.
- Close your mouth, man.

339
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:32,128
Let me rephrase that.

340
00:23:32,264 --> 00:23:34,981
People never talk to me like that.

341
00:23:36,521 --> 00:23:37,666
Stand up.

342
00:23:37,768 --> 00:23:40,419
I guess it's kind of scary for them.

343
00:23:41,225 --> 00:23:44,934
But that's why I really appreciate
what you did in there.

344
00:23:46,281 --> 00:23:48,103
But I was wondering...

345
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:52,259
do you think that you and I could
get together sometime this week?

346
00:23:54,249 --> 00:23:56,801
You know, to go over things.

347
00:23:57,737 --> 00:23:59,427
Financial things.

348
00:23:59,528 --> 00:24:03,489
I'd like to see the areas
where I can afford to take some risks.

349
00:24:03,624 --> 00:24:05,861
- Check your schedule.
- I'll check my schedule.

350
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,256
Great. Let me give you my number.
Do you have a pen?

351
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,488
I don't think I have one.

352
00:24:16,201 --> 00:24:17,892
- Yes, I do.
- Great.

353
00:24:29,608 --> 00:24:31,332
And call me Allegra.

354
00:24:33,736 --> 00:24:36,419
- You're done.
- Goodbye.

355
00:24:40,008 --> 00:24:41,252
Good job.

356
00:24:44,008 --> 00:24:45,023
Oh, damn.

357
00:25:05,609 --> 00:25:09,831
She's some kind of newspaper columnist.
Comes in here once in a while. Great tipper.

358
00:25:09,928 --> 00:25:10,943
What's her drink?

359
00:25:11,048 --> 00:25:14,212
Usually beer.
Tonight, Grey Goose martini, dirty.

360
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,087
Hi.

361
00:25:26,952 --> 00:25:28,578
I noticed your glass was getting low...

362
00:25:28,712 --> 00:25:31,462
so I took the liberty
of bringing you another apple martini.

363
00:25:31,592 --> 00:25:32,541
Thank you.

364
00:25:32,648 --> 00:25:36,510
And I couldn't help but notice
you look a lot like my next girlfriend.

365
00:25:37,064 --> 00:25:39,453
- What's your name?
- They call me Chip.

366
00:25:39,592 --> 00:25:41,665
You can't get them to stop?

367
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:43,938
That was funny.

368
00:25:44,072 --> 00:25:47,421
Listen, I understand the courage it takes
to walk across a room...

369
00:25:47,528 --> 00:25:49,950
and try to generate a relationship
out of thin air.

370
00:25:50,056 --> 00:25:53,701
- So don't take the following personally.
- You have fantastic eyes.

371
00:25:55,048 --> 00:25:56,903
Thanks. Try to listen.

372
00:25:57,032 --> 00:26:00,829
This is no reflection on you.
I'm just not interested.

373
00:26:01,129 --> 00:26:03,495
But thank you for the compliment
of coming over.

374
00:26:03,624 --> 00:26:06,374
You're welcome.
So do you like Cuban food?

375
00:26:07,112 --> 00:26:10,854
Chip, seriously, that was not code for,
"I wish you'd try harder. "

376
00:26:10,985 --> 00:26:14,945
Are you always so shut-down and afraid
that the right man might make you...

377
00:26:15,048 --> 00:26:17,055
Feel like a natural woman?

378
00:26:17,832 --> 00:26:20,898
Sorry I'm late, honey.
I couldn't get a cab. How was the meeting?

379
00:26:21,032 --> 00:26:24,545
Well, there was a beginning,
a middle, and an end.

380
00:26:24,968 --> 00:26:26,856
Nice to meet you, Chip.

381
00:26:31,944 --> 00:26:33,221
You, too.

382
00:26:36,168 --> 00:26:38,688
On the one hand,
it is very difficult for a man...

383
00:26:38,825 --> 00:26:41,410
to even speak to someone
who looks like you.

384
00:26:41,544 --> 00:26:44,610
But on the other hand,
should that be your problem?

385
00:26:44,745 --> 00:26:47,134
So life's kind of hard all around.

386
00:26:47,752 --> 00:26:49,989
Not if you pay attention.

387
00:26:51,752 --> 00:26:53,640
You're sending all the right signals:

388
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:57,053
No earrings, heels under two inches,
your hair is pulled back...

389
00:26:57,192 --> 00:27:00,672
wearing reading glasses with no book,
drinking a Grey Goose martini...

390
00:27:00,776 --> 00:27:03,907
which means you had a hell of a week
and a beer just wouldn't do it.

391
00:27:04,008 --> 00:27:05,317
If that wasn't clear enough...

392
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:09,377
there's always the "fuck off"
that you have stamped on your forehead.

393
00:27:09,512 --> 00:27:13,636
Who'd believe there's a man out there
that can sit by a woman he doesn't know...

394
00:27:13,737 --> 00:27:17,665
and genuinely be interested in who she is,
what she does, without his own agenda?

395
00:27:17,768 --> 00:27:20,583
I wouldn't even know
what that would look like.

396
00:27:20,744 --> 00:27:22,654
So what would a guy like that say?

397
00:27:22,793 --> 00:27:26,054
He'd say, "My name is Alex Hitchens
and I'm a consultant. "

398
00:27:26,184 --> 00:27:27,940
But she wouldn't be interested in that...

399
00:27:28,072 --> 00:27:30,439
because she'd be counting the seconds
until he left.

400
00:27:30,536 --> 00:27:32,925
Thinking he was like every other guy.

401
00:27:33,064 --> 00:27:36,130
Which, life experience has taught her,
is a virtual certainty.

402
00:27:36,264 --> 00:27:38,948
But then he'd ask her name
and what she did for a living...

403
00:27:39,048 --> 00:27:41,154
and she might blow him off.

404
00:27:41,352 --> 00:27:43,075
<i>Or she might say...</i>

405
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:51,175
<i>I'm Sara Melas.
I run the gossip column at the Standard.</i>

406
00:27:51,304 --> 00:27:54,151
And then he'd ask
all these penetrating questions about her...

407
00:27:54,248 --> 00:27:57,347
because he was sincerely,
if atypically, interested.

408
00:27:57,449 --> 00:27:58,463
No.

409
00:27:58,824 --> 00:28:01,158
- No?
- He'd be interested.

410
00:28:02,505 --> 00:28:04,577
But he'd see that there was no way...

411
00:28:04,712 --> 00:28:08,357
he could possibly make her realize
that he was for real.

412
00:28:08,456 --> 00:28:13,377
Well, he could be funny and charming
and refreshingly original.

413
00:28:14,184 --> 00:28:15,591
Wouldn't help.

414
00:28:15,689 --> 00:28:18,688
- Don't you hate it when that happens?
- Not really.

415
00:28:18,825 --> 00:28:22,370
They'd both probably go on
to lead the lives they were headed toward.

416
00:28:22,504 --> 00:28:25,188
My guess is they'd do just fine.

417
00:28:27,209 --> 00:28:30,143
It's a pleasure to have met you, Sara Melas.

418
00:28:34,984 --> 00:28:38,301
Grey Goose martini
from the gentleman who just left.

419
00:28:43,464 --> 00:28:44,991
Is that for me?

420
00:28:47,688 --> 00:28:48,768
What?

421
00:29:03,432 --> 00:29:05,571
Vance Munson. Sorry I'm late.

422
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:09,318
No, not a problem.

423
00:29:10,504 --> 00:29:12,228
<i>Wow, you're the...</i>

424
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:16,707
<i>- Can I get you something to drink, Mr...
- No, I'm fine, thank you.</i>

425
00:29:16,808 --> 00:29:18,597
So, tell me about her.

426
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:22,594
Have you ever met someone...

427
00:29:22,696 --> 00:29:25,379
and you knew right away
she was gonna be important to you?

428
00:29:25,512 --> 00:29:28,774
Not just because of her looks,
but that X factor.

429
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,229
How'd you meet her?

430
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:34,597
Actually, I was in a shop
buying pajamas for my mom.

431
00:29:34,696 --> 00:29:36,518
And by that, of course, you mean...

432
00:29:36,616 --> 00:29:39,431
you were buying lingerie
for another woman.

433
00:29:40,744 --> 00:29:44,224
Yes. You can't help
where you meet somebody.

434
00:29:44,904 --> 00:29:47,326
And the lingerie is for a woman
I'm no longer seeing.

435
00:29:47,464 --> 00:29:50,213
But anyway, the girl I met,
the one I was talking about...

436
00:29:50,344 --> 00:29:52,929
she's so sweet, funny, Southern.

437
00:29:53,064 --> 00:29:55,966
She gives me her number.
Now she won't return my phone calls.

438
00:29:56,104 --> 00:29:59,617
I don't know what it is about her.
I just can't get her out of my mind.

439
00:29:59,752 --> 00:30:03,614
You know, food has lost its taste.
Colors, they seem dull.

440
00:30:03,752 --> 00:30:07,330
<i>Things that used to matter...
I don't know, they just no longer do.</i>

441
00:30:07,464 --> 00:30:10,311
<i>I think things aren't gonna snap back
unless I...</i>

442
00:30:12,136 --> 00:30:13,794
Unless I bang her.

443
00:30:15,912 --> 00:30:17,221
Excuse me?

444
00:30:18,888 --> 00:30:22,204
You know, bang her. Clear my head.
Get in, get off, get out.

445
00:30:24,872 --> 00:30:28,036
I think you may have misunderstood
what I do exactly.

446
00:30:28,136 --> 00:30:30,754
No, I was told you help guys get in there.

447
00:30:30,856 --> 00:30:32,710
Right. But, see, here's the thing.

448
00:30:32,808 --> 00:30:36,070
My clients actually like women.

449
00:30:38,696 --> 00:30:41,030
Hit it and quit it is not my thing.

450
00:30:41,128 --> 00:30:44,903
Let me make one thing clear to you, rabbi.
I need professional help.

451
00:30:45,032 --> 00:30:47,716
Well, that is for damn certain.

452
00:30:48,136 --> 00:30:52,511
And I'm glad you can admit it
because generally that's the hardest part.

453
00:30:55,336 --> 00:30:58,336
You see what I'm doing?
This is what I'm about.

454
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:01,379
Power suit, power tie, power steering.

455
00:31:01,512 --> 00:31:05,374
People can wince, cry, beg,
but eventually they do what I want.

456
00:31:07,208 --> 00:31:09,215
So that's, like, a metaphor.

457
00:31:11,688 --> 00:31:14,437
Well, I'm more of a literal kind of guy.

458
00:31:14,536 --> 00:31:16,259
So when I do this...

459
00:31:18,216 --> 00:31:22,307
this is more like me saying
that I will literally break your shit off...

460
00:31:22,408 --> 00:31:25,157
if you ever touch me again. Okay, pumpkin?

461
00:31:25,256 --> 00:31:26,434
Got it.

462
00:31:34,152 --> 00:31:36,040
No.

463
00:31:36,136 --> 00:31:40,227
Pablo, I can't just mention your restaurant.
Somebody has to eat there.

464
00:31:40,328 --> 00:31:43,142
No, somebody famous. You know that.

465
00:31:43,432 --> 00:31:44,992
- Sara Melas?
- No.

466
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:47,391
Okay. Bye.

467
00:31:49,384 --> 00:31:51,140
I need your signature.

468
00:32:04,776 --> 00:32:09,249
<i>I hate it when a guy calls a girl
who did not give him her number.</i>

469
00:32:09,384 --> 00:32:11,718
<i>So this is me not calling. Over.</i>

470
00:32:11,816 --> 00:32:14,663
Yes, you're right.
This is much less invasive.

471
00:32:14,792 --> 00:32:17,541
I've been thinking about
that sign on your forehead.

472
00:32:17,672 --> 00:32:21,501
And I was wondering if you'd mind
taking it down for dinner Friday night. Over.

473
00:32:21,928 --> 00:32:25,092
I can't. I have a couple of parties
I have to hit.

474
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:27,329
<i>Gossip never sleeps.</i>

475
00:32:27,816 --> 00:32:29,726
Not till about 4:00 a. m.

476
00:32:30,216 --> 00:32:31,460
Saturday.

477
00:32:34,344 --> 00:32:35,773
I have a date.

478
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:40,038
Do you know the definition
of "perseverance," Miss Melas?

479
00:32:40,136 --> 00:32:42,143
An excuse to be obnoxious?

480
00:32:42,312 --> 00:32:44,222
<i>Continuing in a course of action...</i>

481
00:32:44,328 --> 00:32:48,419
without regard to discouragement,
opposition or previous failure. Over.

482
00:32:48,776 --> 00:32:50,783
Okay, Webster, how do I get rid of you?

483
00:32:50,888 --> 00:32:53,735
Breakfast, Sunday.
And you can barely even call that a date.

484
00:32:53,864 --> 00:32:57,573
You do that with out-of-town relatives
that you don't even like. Over.

485
00:33:01,416 --> 00:33:02,627
Come on.

486
00:33:05,032 --> 00:33:07,301
Okay, I guess I could do Sunday.

487
00:33:07,848 --> 00:33:10,117
You forgot to say "over. " Over.

488
00:33:10,567 --> 00:33:13,502
This conversation's over
as soon as you tell me when and where.

489
00:33:13,608 --> 00:33:16,455
7:00 a. m., North Cove Marina. Over and out.

490
00:33:16,904 --> 00:33:20,613
7:00 a. M? Are you crazy?
I don't do 7:00 a. m.

491
00:33:22,504 --> 00:33:23,813
- Hello?
- Sign here.

492
00:33:24,232 --> 00:33:25,792
- What?
- You said Sunday, right?

493
00:33:25,896 --> 00:33:26,976
Yeah.

494
00:33:29,832 --> 00:33:32,199
What if I would have said Friday?

495
00:33:32,295 --> 00:33:33,473
Sunday.

496
00:33:37,512 --> 00:33:40,130
So I guess you're not going to church.

497
00:33:52,424 --> 00:33:55,009
Do you really expect me to wear this?

498
00:33:56,488 --> 00:33:58,910
Itll be awful cold out there without it.

499
00:33:59,016 --> 00:34:02,016
- Good morning.
- "Good" would have been at 10:00.

500
00:34:06,247 --> 00:34:08,451
You're a lot taller than I remember.

501
00:34:08,584 --> 00:34:10,438
You ever ride one of these?

502
00:34:10,536 --> 00:34:12,129
Not on the Hudson.

503
00:34:12,263 --> 00:34:15,133
So, what do you wanna do?
Race me around the Statue of Liberty?

504
00:34:15,272 --> 00:34:16,832
If there's time.

505
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:19,777
- But you might need these.
- All right.

506
00:34:19,912 --> 00:34:21,221
- Bam.
- Wow.

507
00:34:22,376 --> 00:34:23,805
How do I look?

508
00:34:25,032 --> 00:34:26,276
Fabulous.

509
00:34:28,008 --> 00:34:29,666
All right, I give.

510
00:34:30,472 --> 00:34:32,032
Where do I change?

511
00:34:32,968 --> 00:34:37,376
So we'll go past the wall, then take a left.
It's pretty much a straight shot from there.

512
00:34:37,512 --> 00:34:40,611
- Straight shot to where?
- That's for me to know and you to find out.

513
00:34:40,744 --> 00:34:42,337
What you do with these babies is...

514
00:34:42,472 --> 00:34:45,538
Yeah, what I do with this baby
is kick your ass.

515
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,062
- What happened? You change your mind?
- It just died.

516
00:35:58,184 --> 00:35:59,744
Did you put gas in it?

517
00:36:00,295 --> 00:36:04,092
No. You know, I think it must have
sucked up a diaper or something.

518
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,567
Gross. Try it again.

519
00:36:10,216 --> 00:36:11,743
You want me to call AAA?

520
00:36:11,848 --> 00:36:14,237
Come on around
and let me hop on with you.

521
00:36:14,376 --> 00:36:17,922
I don't know. What if you break mine, too?
Then we'll both be sitting ducks.

522
00:36:18,056 --> 00:36:21,569
- I didn't break it. It just died.
- Yeah, yeah.

523
00:36:21,704 --> 00:36:23,614
All right, hop on.

524
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,810
- Scoot back.
- Hitch, I'm already here.

525
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,051
But you don't know where we're going.

526
00:36:30,184 --> 00:36:32,770
Why don't you tell me?
Then we'll both know.

527
00:36:35,463 --> 00:36:37,024
Man, male egos.

528
00:36:37,127 --> 00:36:39,844
I don't know how you guys
make it through the day with them.

529
00:36:39,976 --> 00:36:41,983
What? It is not my ego.

530
00:36:42,088 --> 00:36:44,738
I just don't want to ruin the surprise.

531
00:36:54,407 --> 00:36:57,058
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

532
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,895
There. I always keep a few of those around.

533
00:37:02,024 --> 00:37:03,006
Thank you.

534
00:37:03,143 --> 00:37:06,940
I have lower back trouble.
I just shove the ice packs right down there.

535
00:37:07,464 --> 00:37:09,286
No. That's a fresh one.

536
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:12,705
So, Ellis Island.

537
00:37:12,968 --> 00:37:16,929
I have to admit, I have lived in New York
my whole life and I've never been here.

538
00:37:17,064 --> 00:37:18,525
I figured that. Most people haven't.

539
00:37:18,663 --> 00:37:21,119
So I got my man Larry here
to set us up a private tour.

540
00:37:21,256 --> 00:37:23,165
- Great!
- Anything for Hitch.

541
00:37:24,744 --> 00:37:27,842
It was originally known as Oyster Island.

542
00:37:27,976 --> 00:37:30,529
The island was expanded
to its present size...

543
00:37:30,664 --> 00:37:34,625
with dirt removed during the construction
of the New York subway system.

544
00:37:35,335 --> 00:37:36,862
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

545
00:37:36,968 --> 00:37:40,066
- Did you know this?
- Yeah. That's why I brought you here.

546
00:37:40,168 --> 00:37:44,772
In fact, over 100 million Americans
can trace their ancestry...

547
00:37:44,904 --> 00:37:48,766
back to a single man, woman, or child
on the ship's manifest...

548
00:37:48,904 --> 00:37:50,846
to an inspector's ledger.

549
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:56,156
By 1910, 75% of the residents of New York...

550
00:37:56,295 --> 00:37:59,459
Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, and Boston...

551
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,243
were immigrants,
or the children of immigrants.

552
00:38:02,376 --> 00:38:05,758
They generally lived
in the poorest sections of the cities...

553
00:38:05,895 --> 00:38:09,823
in Little Italys, Chinatowns
and other ethnic enclaves.

554
00:38:10,216 --> 00:38:12,321
It's called The Kissing Post.

555
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:17,030
The plaque explains how different cultures
kiss after long absences.

556
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:21,060
Now, what exactly would qualify
as a long absence?

557
00:38:21,576 --> 00:38:22,885
<i>I mean...</i>

558
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,054
- That count?
- No.

559
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,571
I actually had a relative come through here.

560
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,581
- Really?
- Yeah.

561
00:38:37,704 --> 00:38:38,784
What?

562
00:38:39,655 --> 00:38:42,689
- What?
- What was that thing?

563
00:38:43,847 --> 00:38:47,143
No. You know, I was just thinking...

564
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:51,269
you can't really know where you're going
until you know where you've been.

565
00:38:51,367 --> 00:38:54,149
- Ain't that right, Larry?
- Amen, brother.

566
00:38:54,344 --> 00:38:57,727
That's kind of deep for a first date,
don't you think?

567
00:39:01,064 --> 00:39:02,471
What is that?

568
00:39:20,296 --> 00:39:21,986
Oh, my God!

569
00:39:28,263 --> 00:39:32,770
That's my great-great-grandfather.
That's his signature.

570
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:34,813
Jesus, it's right here!

571
00:39:37,703 --> 00:39:39,678
How did you know?

572
00:39:40,583 --> 00:39:43,485
Hitch did the search. I just found the page.

573
00:40:06,215 --> 00:40:07,492
I'm sorry.

574
00:40:16,423 --> 00:40:19,522
I saw that going differently in my mind.

575
00:40:21,863 --> 00:40:26,140
So my family never saw him again.
Well, except for on the Wanted posters.

576
00:40:26,504 --> 00:40:28,773
Look, I'm really sorry.

577
00:40:29,255 --> 00:40:33,052
When I saw it on the computer,
it said, "the Butcher of Cádiz. "

578
00:40:34,695 --> 00:40:39,267
I thought it was a profession,
not a headline.

579
00:40:40,615 --> 00:40:45,088
It's just one of those horrible family legacies
we've all tried to forget.

580
00:40:45,863 --> 00:40:47,172
But thank you.

581
00:40:47,304 --> 00:40:48,580
<i>No, it was...</i>

582
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,687
- A train wreck.
- No.

583
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,230
Let me get you a cab.

584
00:40:56,839 --> 00:40:58,050
Thanks.

585
00:41:00,263 --> 00:41:02,085
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

586
00:41:11,495 --> 00:41:12,575
Taxi!

587
00:41:16,135 --> 00:41:18,590
Poor guy.
Sounds like he went to a lot of trouble.

588
00:41:18,696 --> 00:41:23,333
It was fun. In a disastrous kind of way.
I mean, this isn't exactly a hickey.

589
00:41:24,423 --> 00:41:27,423
At least you got a good story
out of it, right?

590
00:41:29,767 --> 00:41:30,782
Right?

591
00:41:30,887 --> 00:41:34,302
- You should try mine, it's great.
- Wait. You're seeing him again?

592
00:41:35,816 --> 00:41:39,427
Well, look, you said that
I'm always expecting men...

593
00:41:39,527 --> 00:41:42,462
to let me down, right?
Assuming that they're gonna fail?

594
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:43,974
Which he did.

595
00:41:44,775 --> 00:41:47,644
Yeah, but he did it with flair.

596
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:52,483
I mean, Case, he really tanked.

597
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:54,722
And that's a desirable trait?

598
00:41:55,463 --> 00:41:58,147
Yeah. Weird, huh?

599
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:03,072
Now, just keep it simple.
Just like we practiced.

600
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:04,637
We're just leaving a message.

601
00:42:04,743 --> 00:42:07,842
Women like Allegra Cole
don't pick up numbers they don't recognize.

602
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,352
<i>Hello?</i>

603
00:42:12,967 --> 00:42:14,625
She's on the phone!

604
00:42:17,127 --> 00:42:19,015
<i>- Yes. Hello, Miss Cole?
- Yeah.</i>

605
00:42:19,112 --> 00:42:21,119
Hi, I have Albert Brennaman for you.

606
00:42:21,223 --> 00:42:23,590
- One moment, please.
- No. Tell her I'm at lunch.

607
00:42:23,687 --> 00:42:26,502
We called her to tell her you're at lunch?

608
00:42:30,952 --> 00:42:34,846
Allegra. Hi, it's Albert Brennaman.

609
00:42:35,944 --> 00:42:37,504
Hi, how are you?

610
00:42:37,703 --> 00:42:39,842
Good. I'm doing good.

611
00:42:40,231 --> 00:42:43,166
The reason I'm calling
is about our appointment this Wednesday.

612
00:42:43,815 --> 00:42:45,539
Not gonna be able to make it.

613
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,607
Well, when can you make it?

614
00:42:49,223 --> 00:42:50,598
When can I do it?

615
00:42:53,928 --> 00:42:57,091
I don't even know,
because my whole next week is slammed.

616
00:42:57,799 --> 00:43:00,352
Right. But it's all good.

617
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:05,184
No, we're gonna make it happen though,
that's for sure.

618
00:43:05,799 --> 00:43:07,588
We're going to make it happen. Yes.

619
00:43:16,008 --> 00:43:17,414
What's going on over there?

620
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,813
Just moving some things around.

621
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:23,043
Sky Studios.

622
00:43:23,144 --> 00:43:26,405
Tonight I'm actually going
to this fashion thing at Sky Studios.

623
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:27,714
Designer friend.

624
00:43:27,847 --> 00:43:31,742
I just thought it might be something
your designer friend would be interested in.

625
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,156
Yeah, definitely.

626
00:43:33,287 --> 00:43:36,866
Well, great.
Then I will put you back on with my...

627
00:43:54,727 --> 00:43:56,931
- Allegra, over here, please.
- Miss Cole, this way.

628
00:43:57,031 --> 00:43:58,308
Great. One more.

629
00:43:58,408 --> 00:44:01,408
- Hi, there.
- This was a fantastic idea.

630
00:44:01,703 --> 00:44:03,972
I suppose. Hey, where's Maggie?

631
00:44:04,487 --> 00:44:05,949
Late as usual.

632
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:11,651
<i>Tonight I want you to meditate
on the image of an iceberg.</i>

633
00:44:12,007 --> 00:44:13,763
<i>Do you know why I want you to do that?</i>

634
00:44:14,024 --> 00:44:15,649
Because I'm cool?

635
00:44:15,751 --> 00:44:17,507
- No.
- I know, I'm not.

636
00:44:18,247 --> 00:44:20,036
I'm saying that you are an iceberg...

637
00:44:20,167 --> 00:44:23,997
in that over 90% of your mass
is below the surface.

638
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,687
I know I'm heavy. I am.

639
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:30,087
<i>I'm talking about who you are.
It's a metaphor.</i>

640
00:44:30,184 --> 00:44:31,493
<i>Accounting, business...</i>

641
00:44:31,591 --> 00:44:35,999
<i>all of that is just a small part
of a much deeper, richer Albert.</i>

642
00:44:37,191 --> 00:44:38,435
One more.

643
00:44:39,751 --> 00:44:40,995
It's gonna be loud in there...

644
00:44:41,127 --> 00:44:43,647
so this is our opportunity
to break the touch barrier...

645
00:44:43,751 --> 00:44:44,961
<i>in a non-sleazy way.</i>

646
00:44:45,063 --> 00:44:47,965
<i>So get to where it's loudest.
Ask her if she'd like a drink.</i>

647
00:44:48,072 --> 00:44:50,406
Lean in, place your hand
on the small of her back...

648
00:44:50,504 --> 00:44:52,227
and say it in her ear like a secret.

649
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:55,621
<i>Watch your hand placement.
Too high says, "I just wanna be friends. "</i>

650
00:44:55,719 --> 00:44:57,988
Too low says, "I just wanna grab some ass. "

651
00:44:59,047 --> 00:45:01,567
Friends. Ass. Me.

652
00:45:06,631 --> 00:45:09,020
Special issues: Allegra Cole is a celebrity...

653
00:45:09,159 --> 00:45:12,475
which means that when people talk to her,
they'll ignore you completely.

654
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,274
<i>She's classy, so she'll introduce you.</i>

655
00:45:14,407 --> 00:45:17,789
When she does, shake hands hard
and speak up. Let them know you're there.

656
00:45:17,895 --> 00:45:19,683
Show her you can handle being her escort.

657
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:22,849
- Egon, this is Albert.
- How you doing?

658
00:45:23,047 --> 00:45:25,185
- Albert, this is Zak.
- Nice to see you.

659
00:45:25,607 --> 00:45:27,396
These guys are friends with Maggie.

660
00:45:27,623 --> 00:45:30,558
- Been to that new Brazilian restaurant?
- No, but I am...

661
00:45:30,663 --> 00:45:33,151
It's disgusting.
I'm writing an article about it.

662
00:45:34,279 --> 00:45:36,319
Did you see the new installation at MOMA?

663
00:45:36,551 --> 00:45:39,169
- Yes, did you think...
- Disgusting.

664
00:45:40,711 --> 00:45:43,810
Women can always tell
when you're not being real with them.

665
00:45:44,103 --> 00:45:47,452
Worst thing you can do is try to fake it,
because you are a great guy.

666
00:45:47,783 --> 00:45:51,012
And you do have something
to offer Allegra that no other man does.

667
00:45:51,879 --> 00:45:53,286
What was your name? Eggnog?

668
00:45:55,047 --> 00:45:56,127
Egon.

669
00:45:56,615 --> 00:46:00,390
What do you think of the design of the Jets'
new football stadium on the West Side?

670
00:46:00,903 --> 00:46:03,107
Let me guess. Disgusting?

671
00:46:03,975 --> 00:46:05,797
Think it over. We'll be back.

672
00:46:08,103 --> 00:46:11,103
Thank you. I can't stand those guys.

673
00:46:11,239 --> 00:46:13,345
Really? I kind of liked them.

674
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:15,202
But when all is said and done...

675
00:46:15,399 --> 00:46:17,887
tonight is not about Allegra.

676
00:46:18,663 --> 00:46:21,249
- It's not?
- No. Tonight is about Maggie.

677
00:46:21,607 --> 00:46:25,404
A woman's best friend has to sign off
on all big relationship decisions.

678
00:46:25,575 --> 00:46:27,201
So you can't afford to mess this up.

679
00:46:27,303 --> 00:46:29,670
Albert, I want you to meet
my friend, Maggie.

680
00:46:30,183 --> 00:46:32,900
Hi, Maggie.
It's an absolute pleasure to meet you.

681
00:46:33,031 --> 00:46:34,340
I'm Maggie.

682
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:38,239
- No, you're not.
- Actually, I am.

683
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:41,990
Magnus Forester.
Thank you so much for inviting us.

684
00:46:44,167 --> 00:46:46,207
- You have very soft hands.
- Thank you.

685
00:46:48,423 --> 00:46:50,725
- Wow. So do you.
- Thank you.

686
00:46:50,823 --> 00:46:54,598
So tonight, you focus on one thing
and one thing only.

687
00:46:54,952 --> 00:46:55,813
Maggie.

688
00:46:55,975 --> 00:46:59,357
- Where does your inspiration come from?
- Oh, my God.

689
00:47:00,199 --> 00:47:01,661
Anything I see.

690
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:05,665
Something in a magazine,
out on the street...

691
00:47:06,279 --> 00:47:07,293
in an old movie.

692
00:47:08,263 --> 00:47:11,711
The receptive nature of the creative facility
just astounds me.

693
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:14,013
Anybody want any spring rolls?

694
00:47:14,152 --> 00:47:17,315
That's a beautiful tie, by the way.
This whole thing, it just works.

695
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:18,949
Thank you.

696
00:47:20,551 --> 00:47:23,202
- Is he gay?
- I don't think so.

697
00:47:24,807 --> 00:47:25,756
I like him.

698
00:47:25,863 --> 00:47:30,402
About the deejay.
Generally, I have a firm no-dancing policy.

699
00:47:30,503 --> 00:47:33,285
But if she asks, you cannot say no.

700
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:36,133
I'm not worried about dancing.
But if there are people there...

701
00:47:36,232 --> 00:47:40,509
I'm sorry, I hate to be a stickler,
but I need to be thorough.

702
00:47:41,703 --> 00:47:44,124
Show me what you mean
by you're not worried about it.

703
00:47:44,231 --> 00:47:46,370
Trust me. You know what I'm gonna do.

704
00:47:49,351 --> 00:47:51,358
That's what it's all about, right there.

705
00:47:52,071 --> 00:47:53,315
See how it gets bigger?

706
00:47:56,455 --> 00:47:57,916
Now I'm gonna start the fire.

707
00:47:58,247 --> 00:48:01,892
But the feet are going.
I start the fire, I make the pizza.

708
00:48:02,183 --> 00:48:03,393
Hips are always going.

709
00:48:05,031 --> 00:48:06,242
Can't get enough hip.

710
00:48:06,471 --> 00:48:08,838
From there, the Q-Tip.

711
00:48:09,863 --> 00:48:13,060
Q-Tip. Throw it away.

712
00:48:13,767 --> 00:48:15,709
That's not working, hit them with this.

713
00:48:24,103 --> 00:48:26,754
Don't ever...

714
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:28,703
do that again.

715
00:48:30,343 --> 00:48:31,456
Do you hear me?

716
00:48:32,263 --> 00:48:34,052
- Just expressing myself.
- No.

717
00:48:35,463 --> 00:48:38,529
Not like that, you're not, all right?

718
00:48:41,415 --> 00:48:42,789
This is where you live.

719
00:48:43,655 --> 00:48:44,997
Right here.

720
00:48:45,095 --> 00:48:47,965
You live right here, okay? This is home.

721
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:49,565
None of this.

722
00:48:50,183 --> 00:48:51,776
I don't wanna see none of that.

723
00:48:51,879 --> 00:48:53,886
Don't need no pizza. They got food there.

724
00:49:01,767 --> 00:49:04,735
Elbows, 6 inches from the waist,
90-degree angles.

725
00:49:05,287 --> 00:49:07,458
Don't you bite your lip. Stop it.

726
00:49:26,343 --> 00:49:29,212
Women relate dancing to sex, all right?

727
00:49:29,319 --> 00:49:32,188
Even a great dancer can lose it
with one of these.

728
00:49:33,255 --> 00:49:35,710
Okay, now that's what I need to be learning.

729
00:49:46,375 --> 00:49:47,619
Can't stop it.

730
00:49:48,263 --> 00:49:50,051
You cannot stop it.

731
00:49:52,391 --> 00:49:53,504
Next subject.

732
00:49:55,527 --> 00:49:56,476
Get out.

733
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:02,593
Thanks.

734
00:50:03,014 --> 00:50:05,022
So, are you a Knicks fan?

735
00:50:06,983 --> 00:50:08,609
When they're good.

736
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,959
- I'm really sorry.
- Oh, God. Why?

737
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:20,484
- She was there?
- I left you a bunch of messages.

738
00:50:20,967 --> 00:50:22,527
My phone fell in the Hudson.

739
00:50:22,663 --> 00:50:23,972
Yeah, well, it gets worse.

740
00:50:27,751 --> 00:50:28,766
I don't believe this.

741
00:50:28,871 --> 00:50:32,646
- I thought he was a bodyguard.
- I'm the only one who will need protection.

742
00:50:33,031 --> 00:50:35,332
- Max is gonna...
- Gonna be really irritated.

743
00:50:35,943 --> 00:50:39,292
When I got the train this morning,
I thought it was gonna be a good day.

744
00:50:40,231 --> 00:50:42,598
Who the hell is Albert Brennaman?

745
00:50:43,111 --> 00:50:46,177
- Tell me how this happened.
- What? There were some photographers.

746
00:50:46,311 --> 00:50:48,286
Does this even look like dancing to you?

747
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:50,501
That's just a little bit of me being me.

748
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:55,006
No, that's you being a lot of something
you don't need to ever be again.

749
00:50:55,335 --> 00:50:56,797
- It's just one dance.
- No.

750
00:50:57,447 --> 00:51:01,757
One dance, one look, one kiss.
That's all we get, Albert.

751
00:51:01,959 --> 00:51:04,512
Just one shot to make the difference...

752
00:51:04,615 --> 00:51:07,004
between happily ever after and:

753
00:51:07,239 --> 00:51:10,719
"Oh, he's just some guy
I went to some thing with once. "

754
00:51:11,655 --> 00:51:12,603
All right?

755
00:51:18,055 --> 00:51:20,673
- What?
- You said "kiss. "

756
00:51:23,271 --> 00:51:24,700
Is that a problem?

757
00:51:25,574 --> 00:51:28,095
It's not a problem, but this is Allegra Cole.

758
00:51:28,199 --> 00:51:30,436
Eight out of 10 women believe
that the first kiss...

759
00:51:30,535 --> 00:51:33,437
will tell them everything they need to know
about a relationship.

760
00:51:33,543 --> 00:51:36,838
And believe me,
she has definitely thought about it.

761
00:51:37,287 --> 00:51:39,524
- She has?
- Of course.

762
00:51:39,622 --> 00:51:43,103
Not that she's gonna act on it.
So it's no real big deal.

763
00:51:43,335 --> 00:51:46,204
- All right, it's no big deal then.
- It's a very big deal!

764
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:47,718
- Huge.
- Monumental!

765
00:51:47,815 --> 00:51:49,702
<i>You are not listening...</i>

766
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:53,151
I need you to wrap your head around this.

767
00:51:53,255 --> 00:51:55,939
Tomorrow night, Allegra Cole...

768
00:51:56,263 --> 00:51:59,776
could have her last first kiss.

769
00:52:10,311 --> 00:52:12,515
All right, come on,
just show me what you got.

770
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:15,872
- What do you mean?
- Just show me how you would kiss me.

771
00:52:16,615 --> 00:52:17,727
I wouldn't kiss you.

772
00:52:18,183 --> 00:52:19,557
I'm not me, I'm Allegra.

773
00:52:22,311 --> 00:52:23,872
<i>But you're really not, so...</i>

774
00:52:23,975 --> 00:52:27,685
Okay, Albert, end of the night,
you're dropping me off at home.

775
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:30,399
- Show me the magic.
- I'm not comfortable with this.

776
00:52:30,502 --> 00:52:33,950
God, Albert,
I had such a wonderful time with you.

777
00:52:34,055 --> 00:52:35,680
Yeah, how about those Knicks?

778
00:52:36,614 --> 00:52:40,989
You see what I'm doing?
This is a signal. I'm fiddling with my keys.

779
00:52:41,095 --> 00:52:42,622
A woman that doesn't want a kiss...

780
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:45,476
takes her keys out, puts them in the door,
goes in the house.

781
00:52:45,575 --> 00:52:47,582
A woman that wants to kiss, she fiddles.

782
00:52:48,871 --> 00:52:50,180
I'm fiddling.

783
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:52,066
Okay, you have a good night now...

784
00:52:53,351 --> 00:52:55,489
- You see what I'm doing?
- Robbing me?

785
00:52:55,591 --> 00:52:56,606
No.

786
00:52:56,934 --> 00:52:59,585
This is what most guys do.
They rush in to take the kiss.

787
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:01,405
But you're not most guys.

788
00:53:02,182 --> 00:53:06,111
See, the secret to a kiss
is to go 90% of the way...

789
00:53:07,207 --> 00:53:08,352
and then hold.

790
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:15,231
- For how long?
- As long as it takes...

791
00:53:15,782 --> 00:53:17,538
for her to come the other 10%.

792
00:53:17,671 --> 00:53:19,459
Okay, 90%-10%. Got it.

793
00:53:19,591 --> 00:53:22,755
Okay, come on. Shake it off. It's your turn.

794
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:28,612
I had a really nice time tonight, Albert.

795
00:53:31,111 --> 00:53:34,209
I had a great time tonight, too, Allegra...

796
00:53:36,103 --> 00:53:37,510
with a beard.

797
00:54:09,638 --> 00:54:10,566
What's up?

798
00:54:11,431 --> 00:54:14,148
- I'm not feeling it.
- What do you mean? I came 90%.

799
00:54:14,279 --> 00:54:16,221
I'm not feeling like you want it.

800
00:54:16,327 --> 00:54:20,637
Look, I'm Allegra Cole,
the woman of your dreams.

801
00:54:20,743 --> 00:54:24,355
The woman whose green eyes
are limpid pools of desire.

802
00:54:24,455 --> 00:54:26,658
Now, show me the magic, Albert.

803
00:54:27,111 --> 00:54:29,413
- What the hell was that?
- I'm showing you the magic!

804
00:54:29,542 --> 00:54:31,550
No, I said come 90% and then I come 10%!

805
00:54:31,655 --> 00:54:33,149
You don't go the whole 100%!

806
00:54:33,255 --> 00:54:36,604
<i>My mouth was open, Albert.
You overeager son of a...</i>

807
00:54:40,006 --> 00:54:41,413
Other than that, how was it?

808
00:54:42,407 --> 00:54:45,440
They came together, they danced together,
and they left together.

809
00:54:45,927 --> 00:54:48,293
He's cute, in a sheepdog kind of way.

810
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:50,364
For all I know, he's adorable.

811
00:54:50,695 --> 00:54:52,834
<i>But him dating her is...</i>

812
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:54,460
You seem stressed.

813
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:56,257
You and I had an understanding.

814
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:58,748
If you invite Allegra,
you're supposed to call me.

815
00:54:58,919 --> 00:55:00,348
I didn't invite her.

816
00:55:00,551 --> 00:55:03,006
Honestly, sweetie,
I thought she was still in Europe.

817
00:55:03,111 --> 00:55:05,314
- So you invited Albert?
- No.

818
00:55:05,926 --> 00:55:09,821
Look, it says here the tickets
went to some guy named Alex Hitchens.

819
00:55:09,926 --> 00:55:10,909
What?

820
00:55:21,927 --> 00:55:23,137
Machine.

821
00:55:26,375 --> 00:55:27,935
Hi, it's Sara.

822
00:55:31,142 --> 00:55:33,892
I just wanted to say thank you...

823
00:55:34,022 --> 00:55:38,529
for an unforgettable experience...

824
00:55:38,855 --> 00:55:39,935
the other day.

825
00:55:41,383 --> 00:55:43,685
And if you ever want to see
your shirt again...

826
00:55:43,783 --> 00:55:47,579
you can come by
the Fulton Fish Market tonight, around 8:00.

827
00:55:47,943 --> 00:55:49,830
Okay, bye.

828
00:55:53,255 --> 00:55:55,491
- Do you think he'll show?
- Yeah.

829
00:55:55,815 --> 00:55:58,532
He's too much of a player
to have a bad date on his record.

830
00:55:58,822 --> 00:56:01,572
Is this a source or a date?

831
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:03,970
A source.

832
00:56:04,934 --> 00:56:06,527
Well, it sounded like a date.

833
00:56:07,526 --> 00:56:08,933
Well, it was supposed to.

834
00:56:11,974 --> 00:56:15,040
So it looks like a date
and it sounds like a date...

835
00:56:15,431 --> 00:56:18,398
- but it's not a date.
- Yeah. Right.

836
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:20,671
Just checking.

837
00:56:40,039 --> 00:56:42,592
Hi. I wasn't sure you got my message.

838
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:47,165
I wasn't sure you called the right guy.
You must be a glutton for punishment.

839
00:56:47,623 --> 00:56:50,143
Either that or I really wanna pay you back.

840
00:56:50,535 --> 00:56:52,323
I think this is yours.

841
00:56:53,134 --> 00:56:56,363
Thank you.
I'm gonna frame this for my wall of shame.

842
00:56:53,223 --> 00:56:56,452
Thank you.
I'm gonna frame this for my wall of shame.

843
00:56:56,814 --> 00:56:58,788
Really? There's a whole wall?

844
00:56:56,903 --> 00:56:58,877
Really? There's a whole wall?

845
00:56:59,054 --> 00:57:00,614
So what are we getting into?

846
00:57:03,022 --> 00:57:04,844
Ever been to a food rave before?

847
00:57:04,942 --> 00:57:08,716
Happens once a month, all around the city.
Different chefs, different venues.

848
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:10,088
You any good in the kitchen?

849
00:57:10,222 --> 00:57:12,361
I can stand the heat,
if that's what you mean.

850
00:57:12,461 --> 00:57:16,106
Good. Because that's my boss
and his wife right over there.

851
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:17,740
Interesting.

852
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:21,739
Well, here's a concept:
We're paying to cook our own food.

853
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:24,869
Here's another concept:
Shut up. It's an evening out.

854
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:27,113
The longer you're married,
the less you go out.

855
00:57:27,213 --> 00:57:31,305
In a couple of years, we're gonna end up
bricked into our apartment like a Poe story.

856
00:57:32,269 --> 00:57:34,888
So, Louise, are you
in the newspaper business, also?

857
00:57:35,022 --> 00:57:36,298
No, I'm a psychiatrist.

858
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:40,874
Well, that's the last thing
I'm gonna say tonight.

859
00:57:41,646 --> 00:57:45,028
So, Sara, you never told me.

860
00:57:45,293 --> 00:57:48,970
How was the Sky Studio fashion thing
you went to the other night?

861
00:57:49,102 --> 00:57:52,265
Did you meet anyone worth mentioning?

862
00:57:52,654 --> 00:57:53,668
No.

863
00:57:55,309 --> 00:57:58,855
Really? I find that very odd.

864
00:57:59,374 --> 00:58:01,578
- Max.
- I think you're being odd.

865
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:05,026
Well, I'm always odd.
It's why you married me.

866
00:58:05,165 --> 00:58:07,205
And it's why I married you.

867
00:58:08,366 --> 00:58:09,827
Speaking of which, Hitch...

868
00:58:09,934 --> 00:58:13,611
what exactly are your intentions
for the lovely Sara?

869
00:58:13,741 --> 00:58:16,872
Wait, you know what?
Actually, there was someone.

870
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:21,863
I think I met your friends Albert and Allegra.

871
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:25,255
- My friends who and who?
- Allegra Cole?

872
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:27,495
Really? How do you know her?

873
00:58:28,845 --> 00:58:31,016
- I don't.
- So you know Albert?

874
00:58:32,493 --> 00:58:34,468
- Knew.
- He had your tickets.

875
00:58:34,573 --> 00:58:37,869
I mean, how well do you really
know your accountant?

876
00:58:39,021 --> 00:58:42,731
April 15, and then you don't see him again
till April 15.

877
00:58:44,173 --> 00:58:45,417
Ladies and gentlemen...

878
00:58:45,517 --> 00:58:48,583
a coquille St. Jacques
with a lemon butter reduction.

879
00:58:48,782 --> 00:58:50,821
- Compliments of our chef.
- Thank you.
