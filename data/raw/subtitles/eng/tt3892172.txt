2
00:02:31,149 --> 00:02:32,518
Thank you.

3
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:39,827
Dad, this wood is really
good for feathering.

4
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,898
It's really nice work.

5
00:03:39,184 --> 00:03:40,687
Thank you.

6
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:45,151
Look.

7
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:49,153
Oh!

8
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:50,754
Excellent haul.

9
00:04:50,756 --> 00:04:52,822
Need help?

10
00:04:52,824 --> 00:04:54,824
Uh, could you
tighten that

11
00:04:54,826 --> 00:04:56,696
with the screw
right here?

12
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,999
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Hold it. Yeah.

13
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,934
Will it cook a mushroom?

14
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:05,772
It should
cook a mushroom.

15
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,778
- You put it on here?
- Just like that.

16
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:21,351
- It might take a while.
- Might take a little bit.

17
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,324
Shoo.

18
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:29,427
Shoo!

19
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,698
- Shoo.
- Seems like the pack's gotten bigger.

20
00:05:32,864 --> 00:05:34,964
Yep.

21
00:05:34,966 --> 00:05:36,834
Shoo! Shoo.

22
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:49,016
- Need a extra layer?
- Yeah.

23
00:06:07,232 --> 00:06:09,033
That's leaking a lot.

24
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,737
Would you
hand me the tape?

25
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,312
- How we looking?
- This one needs another piece.

26
00:06:21,446 --> 00:06:23,480
Here as well.

27
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:25,117
Yeah.

28
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,388
You got it?

29
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,893
Okay.

30
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:15,299
Here.

31
00:07:39,357 --> 00:07:41,795
Dad,
it's been really damp.

32
00:07:51,603 --> 00:07:54,206
Dad. It's okay.

33
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,310
We can use
the propane.

34
00:08:02,848 --> 00:08:04,216
Don't waste it.
We're low.

35
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:08,120
I'm hungry.

36
00:08:29,374 --> 00:08:30,810
It's really good.

37
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,146
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

38
00:08:42,954 --> 00:08:46,425
It's okay. It's a work crew. I saw them
earlier. They're down by the pathways.

39
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:52,464
Drill.

40
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:17,254
You're burned. Your tracks
are all over the place.

41
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,458
- Dad, I can do this.
- Well, then do it well.

42
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,030
Hey.
Do it well.

43
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,498
One more time.

44
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,033
- Ten.
- Fifteen.

45
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,304
Nine. Eight.

46
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,140
Seven.

47
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,321
Better.

48
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,654
Your socks.

49
00:09:51,656 --> 00:09:53,993
- What?
- Your socks burned you.

50
00:09:55,093 --> 00:09:56,693
You gotta muddy 'em up.

51
00:09:56,695 --> 00:09:57,930
Ankles were down.

52
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,967
Shine. Shadow.

53
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:03,567
- Shape.
- Dad.

54
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,235
It's better.
What?

55
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:06,539
I'm hungry.

56
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:44,374
- Dad.
- Mmm?

57
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,692
Whoa.

58
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:07,300
What's
your favorite color?

59
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,405
What's yours?

60
00:11:14,406 --> 00:11:16,407
Yellow.

61
00:11:26,584 --> 00:11:28,454
What was my mother's
favorite color?

62
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,426
Yellow.

63
00:11:36,161 --> 00:11:37,696
Maybe
she taught me that.

64
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,035
Mmm.

65
00:11:46,771 --> 00:11:49,008
I wish
I could remember her.

66
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:53,545
Well, she would have
wished for that too.

67
00:11:57,382 --> 00:11:59,018
Get some sleep.

68
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,622
Sleep.

69
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:06,325
Good night, yellow.

70
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,562
Good night.

71
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:50,069
- Why are we going to town today?
- Your appetite's growing.

72
00:12:50,902 --> 00:12:52,668
<i>I'm</i> growing!

73
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,772
I know.

74
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,774
See that?

75
00:12:58,776 --> 00:13:01,448
- See my boot, my track?
- Yeah.

76
00:13:03,348 --> 00:13:05,517
Yeah, I think we need
a new path.

77
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,794
Dad.

78
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:20,199
If it's still here when we
get back, can I keep it?

79
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:27,674
Okay. That's fair.

80
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,809
Come on.

81
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,547
Ah-ah. In plain view.

82
00:13:57,468 --> 00:13:58,737
- Turn around.
- Whoa.

83
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:33,302
<i>The cabin
will swing as it passes the tower.</i>

84
00:14:33,304 --> 00:14:35,208

86

<i>As you exit, look both ways
before crossing the tracks.</i>

87
00:15:27,892 --> 00:15:28,893
Hello.

88
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:34,664
I say, uh, kinda... I'd call
it, like, a stress coin.

89
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,301
You put it in your pocket, and
if you have some stress here...

90
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:40,437
If you have a friend or family
member in trouble that's a vet,

91
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,471
just pull it out
and find a phone,

92
00:15:42,473 --> 00:15:45,008
call 'em up and just press
"1" with that number.

93
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,545
- Can I take this?
- Absolutely.

94
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,746
That's a gun lock.
It goes in the barrel.

95
00:15:50,748 --> 00:15:53,450
Keeps them from accidentally
shooting someone.

96
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,519
And it gives them
time to think

97
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,958
before they commit something wro...
even worse, so...

98
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,314
- Long or short grain?
- Long.

99
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,921
Dad.
Can we get these?

100
00:16:35,626 --> 00:16:36,927
Okay.

101
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,598
Want or need?

102
00:16:40,732 --> 00:16:41,867
Both.

00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:06,492
Sell them to me.

106
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:10,596
Xannies.

107
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,864
Prazosin.

108
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,501
When was the last time
that stopped a nightmare?

109
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,436
They're all
pretty much useless anyway.

110
00:17:20,438 --> 00:17:24,643
I haven't taken them in two
years, seven months, and 28 days.

111
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:30,046
- Can you play your doctor any harder?
- I don't want to get flagged.

112
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:32,048
At first they're handing
them out like candy.

113
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,017
Then they pull
the leash on us.

114
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,818
Well...

115
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,790
Anything you get, bring it to me,
I'll take it off your hands.

Hello?

119
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,422
Somebody up there?

120
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,124
Hello!

121
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,794
Hello?

122
00:19:10,515 --> 00:19:13,485
Is it dangerous to move the
pawn in front of the king?

123

00:19:42,947 --> 00:19:45,649
This is not a drill.

125
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,557
Yeah, right up here.

126
00:20:30,194 --> 00:20:31,795
Seek.

127
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,566
Hey. Hey.

128
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,649
He's got him.

129
00:20:59,657 --> 00:21:01,293
- Still.
- Stand up.

130
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,196
Still.

Don't move.

134

- Anything on you that's gonna hurt me?
- Just the knives.

135
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:27,886
Where were you running?

136
00:21:29,887 --> 00:21:32,058
Huh?
You alone out here?

137
00:21:34,725 --> 00:21:36,227
My daughter is with me.

138
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:39,064
Tom, come out.

139
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:43,732
Tom, come out!

140
00:21:45,169 --> 00:21:47,639
Stand up.

141
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,043
- Come on.
- Dad?

142
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,817
Go down there.

143
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,751
Cooperate. We haven't
done anything wrong.

144
00:22:02,753 --> 00:22:06,423
- Cooperate.
- We don't know who you are or what's going on.

145
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,793
Let's go.

146
00:22:10,695 --> 00:22:12,732
Dad!

147
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:19,704
Dad?

148
00:22:22,406 --> 00:22:24,676
- Dad.
- Can you tell me where you live?

In the park?

150
00:22:31,982 --> 00:22:33,985
Just walk down here to me.
Okay?

151
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:38,253
I want to go with my dad.

152
00:22:38,255 --> 00:22:40,323
Please.
I want to go with my dad.

153
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:42,858
- I know you do.
- Please. I want to go with my dad!

154
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,993
And you may be able
to go with your dad.

155
00:22:44,995 --> 00:22:48,298
- But right now we need to ask you some questions.
- Why'd you chase us?

156
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,233
We need to figure out
what's going on here.

157
00:22:51,235 --> 00:22:54,139
- You needed a dog to figure that out?
- It's a big park.

158
00:23:03,214 --> 00:23:06,851
I want you to tell me a
little bit about your dad.

159
00:23:07,918 --> 00:23:09,986
Does he drink
or take pills

160
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,991
or anything
that makes him act strange?

161
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,827
Does he have weapons here?
Anything that might hurt somebody?

162
00:23:18,829 --> 00:23:19,999
No.

163
00:23:21,165 --> 00:23:24,002
Okay.
Does he hide things?

164
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:40,352
This is where we keep our
tools and important papers.

165
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,156
One second.

166
00:23:46,323 --> 00:23:47,892
Thank you.

167
00:24:51,121 --> 00:24:52,957
Are you just gonna
stand there?

168
00:25:17,915 --> 00:25:19,982
What are you doing?

169
00:25:19,984 --> 00:25:22,018
We're making,
um, dream boards.

170
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,088
You cut out pictures that
have to do with your future.

171
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:30,929
So, like, houses or pets
or jobs, stuff like that.

172
00:25:32,129 --> 00:25:34,396
Something
to look forward to.

173
00:25:34,398 --> 00:25:37,567
Like, for example, I want
love in my future, so...

174
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:40,405
It's just something that we do every
week, and it gives us a path.

175
00:25:45,676 --> 00:25:47,847
So, what are you
doing here?

176
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:53,215
I wasn't where I was supposed
to be, so they took me away.

177
00:25:53,217 --> 00:25:57,252
Well, <i>they</i> don't think I was
where I was supposed to be.

178
00:25:57,254 --> 00:25:59,157
Okay.
Where were you?

179
00:26:00,157 --> 00:26:02,157
With my dad in the park.

180
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,896
So you're homeless then?

181
00:26:04,995 --> 00:26:06,229
No.

182
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,034
Why else would you be
living in the woods?

183
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:12,669
If you had a home, they
wouldn't have brought you here.

184
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:15,507
They just don't understand
that it was my home.

185
00:26:20,044 --> 00:26:21,446
Where is your dad
now?

186
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:27,549
I think he's somewhere in this building.
He's gonna come get me.

187
00:26:27,551 --> 00:26:30,353
Tiffany, know anyone whose
parents come for them?

188
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:32,524
- No.
- Me neither.

189
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:58,047
You want to make sure that
you fill in each bubble.

190
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:01,384
Don't make any stray marks, 'cause
the computer will grade this test,

191
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:05,290
and the computer can't tell the
difference between bubbles and doodles.

192
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:22,641
"D."

193
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:25,945
"B."

194
00:27:28,445 --> 00:27:30,014
"C."

195
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,750
"A."

196
00:27:33,617 --> 00:27:34,653
"A."

197
00:27:40,724 --> 00:27:44,760
How do you read my answers? You think
they're gonna mean a certain thing?

198
00:27:44,762 --> 00:27:47,529
They might be able to tell us
a little bit more about you.

199
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:50,165
You could just ask.

200
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:52,734
Yeah, but you might not
be able to say it.

201
00:27:52,736 --> 00:27:56,506
We don't have any record of you going
to school. Who taught you how to read?

202
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,775
My dad teaches me.

203
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:01,778
You're actually quite a bit
ahead of where you need to be,

204
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,517
but school is about social skills
too, not just intellectual ones.

205
00:28:08,185 --> 00:28:10,353
Can I see my dad now?

206
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,455
Respond true-false
to each question.

207
00:28:13,457 --> 00:28:16,358
Um, it's voice-activated, so you just
say it right into the microphone.

208
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,760
There's 435 questions.

209
00:28:18,762 --> 00:28:21,463
If you can't answer something
you got three seconds,

210
00:28:21,465 --> 00:28:24,400
it'll beep and move on
to the next statement.

211
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:25,437
There you go.

212
00:28:27,638 --> 00:28:31,175
<i>Welcome.
The test will begin in three seconds.</i>

213
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:37,145
<i>I wake up rested and
peaceful most mornings.</i>

214
00:28:37,147 --> 00:28:38,282
True.

215
00:28:40,217 --> 00:28:43,419
<i>I enjoy reading
articles on crime.</i>

216
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:45,688
False.

217
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,595
<i>My day-to-day life is full of
things that keep me interested.</i>

218
00:28:50,694 --> 00:28:52,295
True.

219
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,732
<i>I have nightmares
or troubling dreams.</i>

220
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:01,773
<i>I think about things that
are too bad to talk about.</i>

221
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:09,681
<i>Things aren't turning out like
the prophets said they would.</i>

222
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,352
False.

223
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:18,757
<i>It seems like
no one understands me.</i>

224
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,159
False.

225
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,165
- Do you feel safe living with your dad?
- Yes.

226
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,832
I saw that the two
of you share a tent.

227
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:32,634
- This ever made you feel uncomfortable?
- No.

228
00:29:32,636 --> 00:29:36,439
- It's warmer with two people at night.
- Yeah.

229
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:39,178
- Has anybody ever touched your body without your permission?
- No.

230
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,345
We didn't need
to be rescued.

231
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:45,213
Your dad needs
to provide you shelter

232
00:29:45,215 --> 00:29:46,382
and a place to live.

233
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:48,784
He did. He <i>does.</i>

234
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:51,287
It's not a crime
to be unhoused.

235
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,489
Many people are.

236
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:56,295
But it's illegal
to live on public land.

237
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:01,931
Is my dad
taking tests like this?

238
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,403
I know there's
a lot of questions,

239
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:10,705
and you wouldn't be the first one
to have a problem with this test.

240
00:30:10,707 --> 00:30:12,741
Okay?

241
00:30:12,743 --> 00:30:15,278
But you can only abstain
from so many.

242
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,445
I don't want it
to count against you.

243
00:30:17,447 --> 00:30:18,816
Okay, so true or false.

244
00:30:20,784 --> 00:30:22,653
"I'm proud of my daughter."

245
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,690
True.

246
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:30,596
She's a really wonderful kid.

247
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:33,699
You did a really great job
raising her.

248
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,568
So let's answer
as many of these as we can.

249
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:41,305
"I am a strong team player."

250
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,539
Used to be.

251
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:45,711
Okay.

252
00:30:48,879 --> 00:30:53,351
"I find it hard to imagine having a
long life and fulfilling my goals."

253
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:14,869
In finding placement
for you and Tom,

254
00:31:14,871 --> 00:31:17,373
we've considered
what kind of support

255
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,709
will be most helpful
for the both of you.

256
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,510
We'd like to go back
to the way we were living.

257
00:31:22,512 --> 00:31:24,649
We have found an option.

258
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:29,384
It's not the park.

259
00:31:29,386 --> 00:31:32,954
Um, it's kind of a special accommodation.
It's pretty isolated.

260
00:31:32,956 --> 00:31:37,626
There would be no rules or regulations
saying you can't live here

261
00:31:37,628 --> 00:31:40,232
because someone
is saying you can.

262
00:32:07,457 --> 00:32:11,493
<i>Traffic has already
begun to back up across the state.</i>

263
00:32:11,495 --> 00:32:14,297
<i>Taking a look
at what the chopper sees...</i>

264
00:32:19,569 --> 00:32:21,836
Where is Forest Park?

265
00:32:21,838 --> 00:32:23,841
It's directly behind us.

266
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:04,446
This is Mr. Walters.

267
00:33:04,448 --> 00:33:06,414
Hi, Tom.
Welcome.

268
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:08,619
Hey there.
Welcome.

269
00:33:16,927 --> 00:33:19,665
I already got you started
on some basic groceries.

270
00:33:25,001 --> 00:33:27,606
And here's a casserole
for later.

271
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:30,940
When I read about you
in the paper...

272
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:34,076
We really can't thank you enough.
This is very generous of you.

273
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:38,980
Well, I'm just happy
we could make this work.

274
00:33:38,982 --> 00:33:42,788
A lot of people like to imagine they
could live the way you guys were living.

275
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:44,890
Um...

276
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:48,923
Okay.

277
00:33:48,925 --> 00:33:50,761
Well, thanks, guys.
Um...

278
00:33:53,397 --> 00:33:56,097
See you guys
in about a week or so.

279
00:33:56,099 --> 00:33:59,937
Tomorrow'll be a full day, so I'll
just leave you two to get settled in.

280
00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:16,887
Feels good to be
by ourselves again.

281
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,391
It does.

282
00:34:28,098 --> 00:34:30,068
They treat you
all right?

283
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,073
It was hard not knowing
how you were doing.

284
00:34:36,673 --> 00:34:38,542
I was worried about you too.

285
00:34:58,595 --> 00:35:00,865
Everything's different now.

286
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:05,837
We can still think
our own thoughts.

287
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,722
Come in.

288
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,795
Here.

289
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,765
Your favorite sweater.

290
00:36:10,734 --> 00:36:12,700
There's something
on my mind.

291
00:36:12,702 --> 00:36:16,805
They said
a person saw you,

292
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:17,843
and...

293
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,913
that's how
they found our camp.

294
00:36:24,881 --> 00:36:27,651
I saw a person, but I
didn't think they saw me.

295
00:36:28,752 --> 00:36:30,521
It was a mistake.

296
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:35,591
Why didn't you
say something?

297
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:36,861
I was afraid.

298
00:36:39,629 --> 00:36:42,767
I didn't want to leave our camp.
It was such a good one.

299
00:36:44,734 --> 00:36:45,968
Yeah.

300
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,839
We stayed there too long.

301
00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:59,551
Are we gonna be
okay here?

302
00:37:04,955 --> 00:37:06,825
We're gonna make
the best of it.

303
00:37:17,801 --> 00:37:20,571
We could sleep out here.
No one would notice.

304
00:37:21,738 --> 00:37:22,874
Yeah.

305
00:37:35,352 --> 00:37:37,752
Morning.

306
00:37:37,754 --> 00:37:41,357
I didn't mean to
interrupt your breakfast.

307
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,392
I was hoping you could help
out with the tree work.

308
00:37:44,394 --> 00:37:46,761
You ever
drive a tractor?

309
00:37:46,763 --> 00:37:48,133
You have any work
in the stables?

310
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:52,667
Yeah, but, uh, I don't want
you down there just yet.

311
00:37:52,669 --> 00:37:57,071
Those are expensive animals
and take some training.

312
00:37:57,073 --> 00:38:00,008
But right now
I need help with the trees.

313
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,879
That's where
I make my money.

314
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:12,156
Swap it out. Yeah, I got about
a half dozen more left.

315
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:19,093
We don't want to send something like
this to a customer in California.

316
00:38:19,095 --> 00:38:21,162
They would not be
pleased with that.

317
00:38:21,164 --> 00:38:24,299
It's got a big hole in it.
The top isn't over center.

318
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:27,305
It's a little wild. We only want
one top on a Christmas tree.

319
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:30,075
No. Right...

320
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:33,008
That one.

321
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:35,310
Right where the line of the
tree meets the leader.

322
00:38:35,312 --> 00:38:37,147
That's where
it needs to be cut.

323
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:54,296
These are things
that were donated to our agency.

324
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:55,633
Got it?

325
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:59,334
We don't need more things.

326
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:02,073
Well, maybe you can find
something you could really use.

327
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:12,980
How you guys feeling
about this place?

328
00:39:12,982 --> 00:39:14,716
Good.

329
00:39:14,718 --> 00:39:15,986
Good.

330
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:23,694
Oh, I brought you the, um,
paperwork to enroll Tom in school.

331
00:39:24,794 --> 00:39:26,194
Here's the statute

332
00:39:26,196 --> 00:39:28,296
so you can read it
and understand it.

333
00:39:28,298 --> 00:39:31,899
Um, I'm gonna need that back
signed next time.

334
00:39:31,901 --> 00:39:35,139
And then we can start talking
about the DMV.

335
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:42,380
Don't forget this last.

336
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:45,850
- Now push it down.
- Down?

337
00:39:49,819 --> 00:39:51,055
Push forward.

338
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,024
Gotcha.
It's okay.

339
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:02,798
Keep pedaling.

340
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,100
- Ready?
- Yeah, but the bike's leaning.

341
00:40:06,102 --> 00:40:08,872
Well, then you gotta counterbalance
it with your weight.

342
00:40:11,307 --> 00:40:13,010
Put your legs
into it.

343
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,879
Look where
you want to go.

344
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:24,352
They offer
free acupuncture

345
00:40:24,354 --> 00:40:29,892
and a safe place to come and share with
each other and unloaden your burden.

346
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:33,895
With that, at this time I'd like to invite
you all to just stand, greet one another.

347
00:40:33,897 --> 00:40:36,064
Say hello to someone that you
may not have met before.

348
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:42,904
- Hello.
- How you doing, now?

349
00:40:42,906 --> 00:40:44,173
Wonderful
to meet you.

350
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,113
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

351
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:54,283
All right,
you may be seated.

352
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,319
Uh, this morning
we have a special...

353
00:40:58,321 --> 00:41:01,990
We have, all the way
from Klamath Falls,

354
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:04,091
For His Glory Dance Troupe,

355
00:41:04,093 --> 00:41:06,328
here to celebrate
and worship God

356
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,397
through both music
and dance.

357
00:41:37,327 --> 00:41:39,861
- Great to see you again.
- Good morning.

358
00:41:39,863 --> 00:41:41,529
Hey, guys.
How are you?

359
00:41:41,531 --> 00:41:44,499
It was really good to see you guys
this morning. You look so good.

360
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:47,405
Would you like to try the flags?
There you go.

361
00:41:48,571 --> 00:41:50,538
If you take
and you cross over,

362
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,573
cross over back
and forth,

363
00:41:52,575 --> 00:41:55,310
and go up and down
with them.

364
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:57,312
- Good to see you.
- Kind of a figure eight.

365
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:59,915
Hi. I'm Pastor Spencer.
Are you new here?

366
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,450
- New.
- Oh, all right.

367
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:03,451
It was great having you in
this morning.

368
00:42:03,453 --> 00:42:06,622
Um, we'd sure love
to have you back.

369
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:08,993
- Thank you.
- All right. Yeah. Join us anytime.

370
00:42:11,961 --> 00:42:13,395
- Dad.
- Yeah?

371
00:42:13,397 --> 00:42:15,930
God created frogs.

372
00:42:15,932 --> 00:42:17,034
Yeah?

373
00:42:19,135 --> 00:42:20,404
Did you know that?

374
00:42:21,638 --> 00:42:23,537
Says who?

375
00:42:23,539 --> 00:42:25,142
This pamphlet.

376
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:28,276
"Considering membership?

377
00:42:28,278 --> 00:42:30,511
There are many ways
to participate...

378
00:42:30,513 --> 00:42:33,147
music, devotional dance,

379
00:42:33,149 --> 00:42:36,084
carpentry,
camp prayer group,

380
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:38,587
rock and roll,
social media."

381
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:41,223
Is that why we went?

382
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:44,429
We went because
Walters asked us to.

383
00:42:46,062 --> 00:42:48,129
You dress up,
show up on Sunday,

384
00:42:48,131 --> 00:42:50,033
people will believe
certain things about you.

385
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:55,537
Then they don't ask so many
questions about our lives?

386
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:57,175
Our lives before.

387
00:44:06,542 --> 00:44:07,678
Hello?

388
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:11,379
- Hey.
- Is this your rabbit?

389
00:44:11,381 --> 00:44:13,251
Yeah.
I didn't see her get by.

390
00:44:15,551 --> 00:44:18,319
I'll take her
from you.

391
00:44:18,321 --> 00:44:20,154
That's all right,
Chainsaw.

392
00:44:20,156 --> 00:44:22,026
Good girl.
Thanks.

393
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:25,596
Yeah.

394
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:30,298
Hey. Hey. Hey.

395
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,502
She likes to take off when I
start clipping her nails.

396
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,770
- And why would you do that?
- For shows.

397
00:44:35,772 --> 00:44:37,408
For 4-H, you know?

398
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:39,542
FFA?

399
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:42,644
Future Farmers
of America.

400
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:44,548
Don't know what that is.

401
00:44:46,149 --> 00:44:47,749
Well, it's a club
where, uh,

402
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:50,118
you learn about
agriculture and animals.

403
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,821
Is that what you want to do in future?
Be a farmer?

404
00:44:53,823 --> 00:44:56,091
I don't know yet.

405
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:58,029
I enjoy the clubs
and stuff.

406
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:01,696
You from around here?

407
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:04,265
No. I just moved in.

408
00:45:04,267 --> 00:45:05,435
Over there.

409
00:45:07,703 --> 00:45:10,008
That's gonna be
my tiny house.

410
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:15,176
I'll have my kitchen sink
about right here.

411
00:45:15,178 --> 00:45:16,745
Window right here.

412
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:19,680
Be able to look out while I'm doing dishes.
Pretty nice.

413
00:45:19,682 --> 00:45:23,620
And then I'm gonna have a loft, little
ladder that goes up. Little sleeping loft.

414
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:27,288
Maybe even have Chainsaw
sleep up there too.

415
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:28,857
- Are you gonna live here?
- Yeah.

416
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:30,728
Where are you
gonna put it?

417
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:34,464
Colorado, I was thinkin'.
Maybe Utah.

418
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,102
That's actually Chainsaw's
mom right there.

419
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:47,412
They look alike.

420
00:45:50,513 --> 00:45:52,279
She still alive?

421
00:45:52,281 --> 00:45:53,617
Yeah,
she's still alive.

422
00:46:05,394 --> 00:46:08,629
If you want, you can set her down.

423
00:46:08,631 --> 00:46:10,501
There you go.

424
00:46:20,877 --> 00:46:22,412
Her ears are soft.

425
00:46:23,479 --> 00:46:25,348
Yeah,
that's my favorite part.

426
00:46:27,316 --> 00:46:30,521
If you like rabbits, you should come
to the meeting. The 4-H meetings.

427
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:33,457
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

428
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:50,872
Tom!

429
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,279
Tom!

430
00:47:09,292 --> 00:47:10,727
- Hi.
- Hi.

431
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:16,665
I met a kid who lives down the road.
We were talking about rabbits.

432
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,437
There was no time to tell you.
It was just happening.

433
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,578
Sorry for making you
worry about me.

434
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:33,281
If we had a phone,
I could have called you.

435
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:36,420
Always been able to
communicate without all that.

436
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:47,365
I think it might be easier
on us if we try to adapt.

437
00:47:48,798 --> 00:47:51,533
We're wearing their clothes.
We're in their house.

438
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,734
We're...

439
00:47:53,736 --> 00:47:56,206
We're eating their food.
We're doing their work.

440
00:47:56,973 --> 00:47:59,341
We have adapted.

441
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:01,913
The only place we can't
be seen is in this house.

442
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,448
We can still think
our own thoughts.

443
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:07,785
Like you said.

444
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:23,265
What if the kids at school
think I'm strange

445
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:24,902
'cause of the way
we were living?

446
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:33,911
How important
are their judgments?

447
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:41,919
Guess I'll find out.

448
00:48:52,662 --> 00:48:54,331
Take one step back.

449
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:58,433
Okay. Keep your rabbit
tucked in there.

450
00:48:58,435 --> 00:48:59,804
Take one more step
forward.

451
00:49:01,437 --> 00:49:03,273
Please return your rabbits
to the table.

452
00:49:08,444 --> 00:49:09,814
Okay. Very good.

453
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:14,685
Okay.

454
00:49:16,819 --> 00:49:18,888
Turn your
rabbits to face you.

455
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:21,955
Take your left arm,

456
00:49:21,957 --> 00:49:24,725
and you'll hold the rabbit
close to you as you lift up.

457
00:49:24,727 --> 00:49:27,330
The other hand on the scruff.
Okay.

458
00:49:28,964 --> 00:49:32,000
Yes. Thank you.
Thank you.

459
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:35,337
Now you can go ahead and just
slowly set them back down.

460
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:36,741
Very good.

461
00:49:39,408 --> 00:49:41,011
Start checking the ears.

462
00:49:44,513 --> 00:49:46,983
Mm-kay.
And listen to its breathing.

463
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:53,053
You want to make sure
that it sounds nice and clear.

464
00:49:53,055 --> 00:49:55,458
Like they don't have any
congestion or anything. Okay?

465
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:03,365
And no... On self presentation as well,
make sure you stand up straight.

466
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:06,368
Smile.
Look happy to be here. Right?

467
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:08,005
A little confidence
is always good.

468
00:50:09,939 --> 00:50:11,575
Very good, guys.

469
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:18,015
Hi. Um...

470
00:50:19,548 --> 00:50:22,716
I wanted to drop off
some paperwork for you.

471
00:50:22,718 --> 00:50:28,555
Um, here is the date for your
appointment with housing.

472
00:50:28,557 --> 00:50:30,860
And I thought
you could use a phone.

473
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:44,408
It's important for you to follow through
so you guys can remain independent.

474
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:47,776
Do you understand?

475
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:48,778
Yes.

476
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:53,515
Okay, well, um, I'll be
back in a couple weeks.

477
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:55,386
We can go over that
and, um...

478
00:50:56,519 --> 00:50:58,388
All right.
I'll see you guys.

479
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:34,087
Pack your things.

480
00:51:34,089 --> 00:51:35,925
Don't take anything
you don't need.

481
00:53:24,133 --> 00:53:25,602
I liked it there.

482
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:29,970
Did you even try?

483
00:53:29,972 --> 00:53:32,073
I did.

484
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:33,544
Huh?

485
00:53:34,877 --> 00:53:38,111
Dad, did you?
'Cause I can't tell.

486
00:53:38,113 --> 00:53:41,684
They were gonna separate us
if we didn't follow their rules.

487
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:50,258
Won't they notice
we're gone?

488
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,830
If we're lucky,
not till tomorrow.

489
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:04,872
What are you doing here?

490
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:06,843
Did you bring them
with you?

491
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:12,015
Since you two got burned,
rangers are here all the time.

492
00:54:21,156 --> 00:54:22,156
Stop!

493
00:55:09,171 --> 00:55:10,307
Ow!

494
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:14,678
Let me see.

495
00:55:19,348 --> 00:55:21,982
Mmm, it's not too deep.

496
00:55:21,984 --> 00:55:23,653
Clean it out.

497
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:47,377
Why are we doing this?

498
00:56:06,261 --> 00:56:08,265
Dad, we shouldn't
be here.

499
00:56:10,466 --> 00:56:13,100
When they start to board, get on.

500
00:56:13,102 --> 00:56:15,039
I'll be in the back.

501
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:20,774
<i>All passengers continuing
northbound will need a bus assignment...</i>

502
00:56:31,053 --> 00:56:33,154
Good afternoon.
Welcome aboard.

503
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:36,156
I would like to, first of all,
assure you that my goal today

504
00:56:36,158 --> 00:56:39,326
is that you have a safe, smooth, and
comfortable ride to your destination.

505
00:56:39,328 --> 00:56:43,363
We will be arriving
in Salem next and Albany.

506
00:56:43,365 --> 00:56:46,969
Then Eugene and, lastly,
the University of Oregon.

507
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:51,875
Mind if I take a look
at your passengers?

508
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,846
Hey. How's it going?

509
00:56:59,848 --> 00:57:01,482
Good.

510
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:04,484
- Are you traveling alone?
- Yes.

511
00:57:04,486 --> 00:57:07,053
- You have any ID on you?
- No.

512
00:57:07,055 --> 00:57:09,156
You don't look like an adult.
You look pretty young.

513
00:57:09,158 --> 00:57:11,091
I'm... 18.

514
00:57:11,093 --> 00:57:13,794
I'm gonna ask you to step off the bus
so we can look into your situation.

515
00:57:13,796 --> 00:57:16,165
- Just grab your bag. Get off the bus.
- Come on.

516
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:05,482
What's wrong?

517
00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:10,953
Dad, no one can see us.

518
00:58:23,365 --> 00:58:25,399
We're pulling in
to the rest area now.

519
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:27,241
We'll be here for about ten minutes.
Thank you.

520
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:41,048
Dad, the bus
is about to leave.

521
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:43,452
We're not getting back on.
We're not getting back on.

522
00:58:46,522 --> 00:58:48,292
Why?

523
00:58:53,263 --> 00:58:54,932
Let me clean it.

524
00:59:00,269 --> 00:59:03,105
What did that woman
on the bus ask you?

525
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:07,341
Nothing. She barely
even noticed me.

526
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:09,946
She was doing
her own thing.

527
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:19,319
This isn't the way
we used to be.

528
00:59:19,321 --> 00:59:21,425
- Have some.
- You hearing me?

529
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:24,294
Drink it.

530
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:36,337
- Hey, are you going north?
- No, sir, I'm not.

531
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:38,104
I'm heading
the opposite direction.

532
00:59:38,106 --> 00:59:40,309
I can't take that liability.
I'm sorry.

533
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:57,658
- We broke down.
- Yeah?

534
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:59,629
Would you take us
up the road a bit?

535
01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:04,365
If I'm gonna give you a ride,
I need to know a few things.

536
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:06,236
Let me talk
to the kid a minute.

537
01:00:10,339 --> 01:00:12,973
Over here.

538
01:00:12,975 --> 01:00:16,410
If you're in trouble here, now
would be a good time to tell me.

539
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:18,548
My dad and I
just really need a ride.

540
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:22,618
Your dad?

541
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:30,290
I just need to know
I'm doing the right thing.

542
01:00:30,292 --> 01:00:32,225
You are.

543
01:00:52,214 --> 01:00:54,247
Not sure why that sheriff
was out here.

544
01:00:54,249 --> 01:00:56,616
Marijuana's legal
up here now.

545
01:00:56,618 --> 01:00:59,520
So it's really not that.

546
01:00:59,522 --> 01:01:02,522
But then you got
all the, uh, people here

547
01:01:02,524 --> 01:01:05,191
got hooked
on pain medication.

548
01:01:05,193 --> 01:01:08,395
That's devastated
their lives.

549
01:01:08,397 --> 01:01:10,566
Families too.

550
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,334
Ruin their marriage.

551
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:16,073
I'm aware of a few people
that have.

552
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:25,281
Well, we just crossed
into Washington.

553
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:33,022
Yeah, anywhere
around here.

554
01:01:35,457 --> 01:01:38,526
- This is that logging road I was talking about right here.
- Hey.

555
01:01:42,731 --> 01:01:44,567
Time to get out.

556
01:01:46,702 --> 01:01:48,334
- Good luck to you.
- Appreciate it.

557
01:01:48,336 --> 01:01:50,638
Yeah.

558
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,140
It was good to have
your company, you guys.

559
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:55,011
- Likewise.
- Bye, Willie Nelson.

560
01:01:56,178 --> 01:01:58,245
Try and stay dry.

561
01:01:58,247 --> 01:02:00,180
- Okay, watch your step.
- Willie will miss ya.

562
01:02:00,182 --> 01:02:01,550
Bye.

563
01:02:06,555 --> 01:02:08,421
It's cold.

564
01:02:08,423 --> 01:02:10,292
We're at
a higher altitude.

565
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:19,769
My fingers are stiff.

566
01:02:57,673 --> 01:02:59,839
You said there'd
be some cabins.

567
01:02:59,841 --> 01:03:02,144
I really thought
there would be.

568
01:03:06,548 --> 01:03:09,283
- My boots are leaking.
- Huh?

569
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:11,388
My boots are leaking.

570
01:03:12,787 --> 01:03:15,124
You have extra socks?

571
01:03:15,857 --> 01:03:17,727
Yeah, they're in my bag.

572
01:03:27,202 --> 01:03:29,105
Keep your gloves on.

573
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:57,865
What are we going to do?
Where are we going?

574
01:03:57,867 --> 01:03:59,736
We're gonna keep moving.

575
01:04:37,772 --> 01:04:39,642
We've gotta move quickly.

576
01:04:58,861 --> 01:05:00,763
Dad? Dad.

577
01:05:03,598 --> 01:05:05,399
Can we please sit?

578
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,303
We gotta keep moving.

579
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:11,504
Please can we sit?

580
01:05:11,506 --> 01:05:14,408
- What?
- I want to sit.

581
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:17,278
- No.
- I can't feel my toes.

582
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,249
- You can't sit down. You can't sit. Come on.
- I'm tired. I need to sit.

583
01:05:55,917 --> 01:06:00,620
Put the knife down.

584
01:06:00,622 --> 01:06:02,891
- Thank you, but put the knife...
- I want to help.

585
01:06:05,093 --> 01:06:06,996
Put the knife down.

586
01:06:42,064 --> 01:06:44,367
It's gonna keep the heat
close to your body.

587
01:06:51,006 --> 01:06:54,310
S... Stay with me.
Stay with me.

588
01:07:07,455 --> 01:07:09,892
Dad, are we gonna freeze
in our sleep?

589
01:07:12,694 --> 01:07:14,030
No, Tom.

590
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:17,767
How do you know?

591
01:07:52,968 --> 01:07:54,537
Hey.

592
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:15,492
Dad. Do you think
it's empty?

593
01:08:49,123 --> 01:08:51,126
It tingles.

594
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:57,531
That's when the blood starts coming back.
Start warming up.

595
01:09:13,248 --> 01:09:15,215
How many are there?

596
01:09:15,217 --> 01:09:16,753
Three.

597
01:09:31,132 --> 01:09:33,502
It's really good.

598
01:09:36,971 --> 01:09:39,775
Maybe we could build
ourselves a place like this.

599
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:44,611
What about a tiny house
in a tree?

600
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:47,784
You wouldn't need any land for that.
Just one tree.

601
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:51,251
Yeah.

602
01:09:51,253 --> 01:09:53,857
Do you miss the things
we had at the farm?

603
01:09:57,126 --> 01:09:58,927
Do you?

604
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:02,598
They were really
never our things.

605
01:10:10,338 --> 01:10:13,075
- Noodles.
- Beans. Noodles.

606
01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:20,850
Jerky.

607
01:10:26,187 --> 01:10:27,787
Chocolate.

608
01:10:27,789 --> 01:10:29,091
Chocolate.

609
01:10:34,629 --> 01:10:37,232
- Can we play chess when you get back?
- Yes.

610
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:49,078
Gather kindling
before dark.

611
01:10:50,178 --> 01:10:51,844
Hey.

612
01:10:51,846 --> 01:10:54,182
Save those matches
for the stove.

613
01:10:59,721 --> 01:11:01,590
I won't be gone long.

614
01:11:07,195 --> 01:11:09,198
Follow the creek.

615
01:11:10,365 --> 01:11:12,569
Over the ridge.

616
01:11:13,836 --> 01:11:15,669
Along there to here?

617
01:11:15,671 --> 01:11:17,006
Uh-huh.

618
01:11:28,016 --> 01:11:29,586
Hmm.

619
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,658
- Make sure you drink some water.
- I will.

620
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,883
"Do you have difficulty
enjoying things?

621
01:12:38,954 --> 01:12:42,091
Have you felt distant
or cut off from people?

622
01:12:49,330 --> 01:12:53,202
Are you unable to have
sad or loving feelings?"

623
01:14:32,601 --> 01:14:34,137
Dad!

624
01:15:38,132 --> 01:15:39,301
Dad?

625
01:15:50,979 --> 01:15:52,315
No.

626
01:16:08,195 --> 01:16:11,166
Can you hear me?
Dad, can you hear me?

627
01:17:00,147 --> 01:17:02,083
Hey! Stop!

628
01:17:05,387 --> 01:17:07,286
I really need your help.
My dad's hurt.

629
01:17:07,288 --> 01:17:10,025
- Get in, get in.
- He's by the stream.

630
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,272
Hold on, bro.

631
01:17:26,374 --> 01:17:27,510
Okay.

632
01:17:40,622 --> 01:17:43,423
- Hi. What's going on?
- We found him up in the woods.

633
01:17:43,425 --> 01:17:46,126
He's in
pretty bad shape.

634
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:47,964
Okay.
Bring him around.

635
01:17:49,564 --> 01:17:51,334
- Okay.
- Go.

636
01:17:55,302 --> 01:17:58,404
I don't know. He's...
He's gotta get to a hospital.

637
01:17:58,406 --> 01:18:00,607
Can someone
from here help?

638
01:18:00,609 --> 01:18:02,809
- No.
- Can you not call anyone?

639
01:18:02,811 --> 01:18:04,810
Can you put it down?

640
01:18:04,812 --> 01:18:06,746
They're gonna treat him,
even if you don't have money.

641
01:18:06,748 --> 01:18:09,482
He just doesn't like
to be asked questions.

642
01:18:09,484 --> 01:18:11,451
Are you in some kind
of trouble?

643
01:18:11,453 --> 01:18:13,254
- No.
- You sure?

644
01:18:15,790 --> 01:18:19,259
Please, can someone just... Can we
just take care of it ourselves?

645
01:18:19,261 --> 01:18:21,460
- Yeah.
- Please, can we just take care of it ourselves?

646
01:18:21,462 --> 01:18:24,596
You don't worry. I'm gonna take care of it.
It's gonna be okay.

647
01:18:24,598 --> 01:18:26,832
- Get yourself some water.
- You don't need to call anybody.

648
01:18:26,834 --> 01:18:28,570
I'll be right back.

649
01:18:50,758 --> 01:18:52,591
Easy.

650
01:18:52,593 --> 01:18:55,330
I bet your head's
about throbbing, isn't it?

651
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:06,475
Uh...

652
01:19:09,811 --> 01:19:12,114
You got any pain?

653
01:19:16,150 --> 01:19:18,718
Mm-hmm. All right.

654
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:21,587
Easy. Let me have it. I'm gonna
have to pull this boot off.

655
01:19:21,589 --> 01:19:24,189
It's gonna hurt.

656
01:19:24,191 --> 01:19:26,628
One, two, three.

657
01:19:34,836 --> 01:19:38,170
Yeah, you did a number.

658
01:19:38,172 --> 01:19:40,206
Now you're with me.

659
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:42,645
Pain lets you know
you ain't dead yet.

660
01:19:44,445 --> 01:19:46,781
Remember being in the woods?

661
01:19:50,252 --> 01:19:53,819
You all right?
Stay with me.

662
01:19:53,821 --> 01:19:55,621
Do you know where you are?

663
01:19:55,623 --> 01:19:57,890
On a couch.

664
01:19:57,892 --> 01:20:00,460
Yeah.
You are on the couch.

665
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:06,468
The good news is, brother, I didn't see any
fluid coming out your nose or your ears.

666
01:20:07,702 --> 01:20:09,902
But this is gonna
take some time.

667
01:20:09,904 --> 01:20:11,837
Blane was a medic
in the army,

668
01:20:11,839 --> 01:20:14,376
so he's in good hands.

669
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:17,643
Was your dad
in the service?

670
01:20:17,645 --> 01:20:19,547
He was.

671
01:20:20,781 --> 01:20:22,717
What happened out there?

672
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:26,288
We got lost.

673
01:20:27,321 --> 01:20:29,757
Where were you guys headed?

674
01:20:32,194 --> 01:20:34,562
I don't think we knew
where we were going.

675
01:20:37,899 --> 01:20:39,735
Where do you live?
Where's your home?

676
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:42,838
With my dad.

677
01:20:50,945 --> 01:20:55,215
Well, he's splinted
and taped up.

678
01:20:55,217 --> 01:20:57,849
There's a fair amount of soft tissue
damage, so that's gonna take time to heal.

679
01:20:57,851 --> 01:21:01,386
That's gonna frustrate him.

680
01:21:01,388 --> 01:21:04,724
It's hard to tell if he may have lost some
function in his toes without an X-ray.

681
01:21:04,726 --> 01:21:07,393
- Can he walk?
- Yes, he'll be able to walk.

682
01:21:08,829 --> 01:21:11,397
Those are for the pain,
when he does finally wake up.

683
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:14,834
- Thank you.
- Yep. You bet.

684
01:21:14,836 --> 01:21:18,304
I'll be back to check on him
in the next couple days.

685
01:21:18,306 --> 01:21:19,808
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

686
01:21:29,016 --> 01:21:31,317
Here you are, dear.

687
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:38,992
Tom, if your dad is messed up with
something or running from someone,

688
01:21:38,994 --> 01:21:41,794
I really need you
to tell me,

689
01:21:41,796 --> 01:21:45,665
'cause folks around here aren't looking
to get mixed up in any trouble.

690
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:47,503
It's not
that kind of trouble.

691
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:55,410
- Get some rest.
- I will.

692
01:22:20,034 --> 01:22:21,936
I'm so sorry.

693
01:22:27,742 --> 01:22:29,278
I know.

694
01:22:52,833 --> 01:22:54,634
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

695
01:23:05,446 --> 01:23:09,782
Okay. Got the other RVs
on up the hill,

696
01:23:09,784 --> 01:23:12,321
but this one's
a little more private.

697
01:23:13,587 --> 01:23:15,323
We'll be out
of your way here.

698
01:23:24,065 --> 01:23:27,503
If you need anything else,
you know where to find me, okay?

699
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:30,836
Thank you.

700
01:23:30,838 --> 01:23:33,408
We won't be here long.

701
01:23:35,043 --> 01:23:36,945
It's not a problem.

702
01:23:49,824 --> 01:23:51,760
I like it.

703
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:25,625
Do you know
what these boxes are?

704
01:24:25,627 --> 01:24:27,426
- No.
- They keep bees.

705
01:24:27,428 --> 01:24:30,196
Have you ever seen
inside of a beehive?

706
01:24:30,198 --> 01:24:31,930
Would you like me
to show you?

707
01:24:31,932 --> 01:24:33,832
Okay, wait right there.

708
01:24:33,834 --> 01:24:35,671
Let me get something
for you.

709
01:24:44,779 --> 01:24:47,979
- When I open this, the bees are gonna come up.
- Mm-hmm.

710
01:24:47,981 --> 01:24:50,215
But they're not
coming out to hurt you.

711
01:24:50,217 --> 01:24:52,919
When a bee stings it dies,
so they don't wanna sting you.

712
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:55,054
They wanna come up
and land on you

713
01:24:55,056 --> 01:24:57,523
and just get to know you.

714
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:04,764
It's kind of nice to have the
trust of a whole box of creatures

715
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:10,102
that have the power to come out
and kill you if they wanted to.

716
01:25:10,104 --> 01:25:12,971
So it means a lot to me
that I have their trust.

717
01:25:12,973 --> 01:25:15,444
- I worked hard to get it.
- Mmm.

718
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:20,782
Come on.

719
01:26:11,632 --> 01:26:13,468
I nearly got it.

720
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:15,904
Lost it.

721
01:26:29,583 --> 01:26:32,084
Kind of looks
like a seahorse.

722
01:26:32,086 --> 01:26:33,187
Yeah.

723
01:26:37,592 --> 01:26:39,925
- How's your dad doing?
- He's okay.

724
01:26:39,927 --> 01:26:41,760
Trying to get up
on the crutches.

725
01:26:41,762 --> 01:26:43,962
Yeah, I didn't figure
he'd stay down for long.

726
01:26:43,964 --> 01:26:47,233
He wants to leave.

727
01:26:47,235 --> 01:26:50,268
I imagine he's trying to find
a way to make it all right,

728
01:26:50,270 --> 01:26:52,206
and now he feels stuck.

729
01:26:54,842 --> 01:26:58,743
You know, my friend here,
Boris, has helped me a lot.

730
01:26:58,745 --> 01:27:01,647
I think your dad would like
having him around.

731
01:27:01,649 --> 01:27:04,215
He can sense
when somebody's restless.

732
01:27:04,217 --> 01:27:07,286
He can nudge him awake and help
him out of the dreams that way.

733
01:27:07,288 --> 01:27:10,055
That's what he does for me.

734
01:27:10,057 --> 01:27:13,227
I wonder if you wouldn't mind
taking him for a few days.

735
01:27:14,962 --> 01:27:16,531
Hey.

736
01:27:54,002 --> 01:27:57,268
Great.

737
01:27:57,270 --> 01:27:59,005
All right.
Good seeing you.

738
01:28:01,208 --> 01:28:02,742
Okay. Thank you.

739
01:28:51,726 --> 01:28:53,629
Thank you, dear.

740
01:29:05,873 --> 01:29:07,773
Dale, this is all
I've got.

741
01:29:07,775 --> 01:29:09,942
Me and Dad,
we want to stay.

742
01:29:09,944 --> 01:29:12,077
Can you take it?

743
01:29:12,079 --> 01:29:14,913
You're welcome to stay down there
until your dad gets better.

744
01:29:14,915 --> 01:29:17,015
If you guys were gonna
be here a long time,

745
01:29:17,017 --> 01:29:21,920
it costs something to stay on for
water and propane, things like that.

746
01:29:21,922 --> 01:29:23,855
Is this enough?

747
01:29:23,857 --> 01:29:25,957
I don't need to take
your money right now.

748
01:29:25,959 --> 01:29:28,262
We want to stay
a long time.

749
01:29:29,363 --> 01:29:30,932
Okay.

750
01:29:32,734 --> 01:29:35,968
I can take this
as a deposit.

751
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:39,037
I'm not gonna rent the place
out from under you.

752
01:29:39,039 --> 01:29:41,874
- Thank you.
- Will you grab that other bag?

753
01:29:41,876 --> 01:29:44,510
Dale, I really like
living here.

754
01:29:44,512 --> 01:29:46,048
Hmm.

755
01:30:02,462 --> 01:30:05,965
I'm looking for the carrots,
the dried carrots.

756
01:30:05,967 --> 01:30:08,367
What's that for?

757
01:30:08,369 --> 01:30:11,773
I leave this out for someone
who lives up in the woods.

758
01:30:13,306 --> 01:30:16,207
Haven't seen him
in years,

759
01:30:16,209 --> 01:30:18,077
but I know
he gets the food

760
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:21,514
'cause when I come back,
the bag is always empty.

761
01:30:21,516 --> 01:30:24,886
That's a good one. Throw
some oranges in there too.

762
01:30:35,495 --> 01:30:37,766
Been the same spot
for years.

763
01:31:09,029 --> 01:31:11,465
Have you ever seen
inside a hive before?

764
01:31:22,909 --> 01:31:24,910
It's cool, huh?

765
01:31:24,912 --> 01:31:27,313
You put your hand
over it.

766
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:29,851
You can feel
the warmth of the hive.

767
01:31:42,029 --> 01:31:44,432
A person can withstand
500 stings.

768
01:31:46,534 --> 01:31:48,336
Close your eyes.

769
01:31:53,274 --> 01:31:55,177
Open.

770
01:32:06,620 --> 01:32:08,890
See, you don't need
to be scared.

771
01:32:29,644 --> 01:32:31,479
I want to
tell you something.

772
01:32:32,946 --> 01:32:34,281
Please do.

773
01:32:37,150 --> 01:32:39,887
I paid for this place,
so we can stay here.

774
01:32:41,622 --> 01:32:44,124
Yeah, that was
the right thing to do.

775
01:32:51,431 --> 01:32:54,299
I rented this place.

776
01:32:54,568 --> 01:32:56,471
So we can live here.

777
01:34:50,684 --> 01:34:52,419
What are you doing?

778
01:34:55,422 --> 01:34:59,224
Dad, your... your leg isn't
even healed all the way.

779
01:34:59,226 --> 01:35:01,730
And it won't.
It won't heal right.

780
01:35:05,665 --> 01:35:07,569
I don't want to leave.

781
01:35:10,204 --> 01:35:12,304
Last time
you almost died.

782
01:35:12,306 --> 01:35:14,773
And you would have
if I hadn't found you.

783
01:35:14,775 --> 01:35:17,612
That will never
happen again.

784
01:35:22,415 --> 01:35:24,817
These people, they're not
that different from us.

785
01:35:24,819 --> 01:35:27,486
Yes, they've been very good
to us, but we have to...

786
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:29,190
You!

787
01:35:32,426 --> 01:35:35,463
You need. Not me.

788
01:35:44,571 --> 01:35:47,409
The same thing that's wrong
with you isn't wrong with me.

789
01:35:50,377 --> 01:35:51,678
I know.

790
01:37:20,868 --> 01:37:22,169
Dad?

791
01:38:07,948 --> 01:38:10,517
I know you would stay
if you could.

792
01:41:46,033 --> 01:41:47,799
He had to go.

793
