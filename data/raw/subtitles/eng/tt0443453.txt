Yes, in America, that's a very popular joke.
Do you have a mother-in-law joke?

127
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,118
- Yes.
- <i>All right.</i>

128
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:36,388

- Sexy time.

130
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,424

132
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,396
Uh, I don't think that Americans

133
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,565
No, it is not a joke.

134
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,235
Yeah, we're talking about,
um, humor.

135
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,710
Oh, yes, you asked me
about my mother-in-law.

136
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,748
Do you have a joke
about your mother-in-law?

137
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,908
No, why make a joke
on a mother-in-law?

138
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,646
Um-

139
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:05,485
Do you ever laugh on people
with retardation?

140
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:08,560
Here in America, we try not to...

141
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:12,893
make fun of or be funny with things
that people don't choose.

142
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,262
But perhaps you have not seen, um...

143
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:18,700
someone with a very funny retardation.

144
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,704
My brother Bilo...

145
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:24,833
have a very funny, uh, retardation.

146
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,208
Um, in mental retardation, you know...

147
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:30,180
it causes a lot of pain and hardship
for a lot of families.

148
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:33,012
Sometime my sister,
she show her vagine...

149
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,952
to my brother, Bilo, and say...

150
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:39,684
"You will never get this.
You will never get this. La-la-la-la-la."

151
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,818
He, uh, behind his cage, crazy, crazy.
Everybody laugh.

152
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,953
She go, "You never get this."

153
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:49,524
Uh, but one time he break cage
and he get this.

154
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:52,229
And then we laugh. High five.

155
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,935
Now, um-

156
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:02,476
Um, no, that would not be funny
in America, okay?

157
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:05,550
What is a "not" jokes?

158
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:09,382
<i>A "not" joke is when we're trying</i>
<i>to make fun of something...</i>

159
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:13,857
and what we do is, we make a statement
that we pretend is true...

160
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,520
but at the end, we say "not,"
which means it's not true.

161
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,097
So teach me how to make one.

162
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,962
- All right. What color is your suit?
- This suit is gray.

163
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,830
Gray. I would call it blue, okay?

164
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:25,961
- It's gray.
- All right, it's blue-gray.

165
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,062
- But it's certainly not black, right?
- Well, it's more gray.

166
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:31,905
- All right, let's say it's gray. But it's not-
- It is gray.

167
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,479
Okay, so a "not" joke, I would say...

168
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,208
"That suit is black. Not!"

169
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:41,082
This-a suit is <i>not</i> black.

170
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:44,020
- No, no, "not" has to be the end. Okay.
- Okay.

171
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,353
This suit is black not.

172
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,359
This suit is black. Pause.
You know what a pause is?

173
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:52,191
- <i>Yes.</i>
- This suit is black. Not!

174
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:55,495
This suit is black, pause, not.

175
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:58,161
No, you don't say "pause."

176
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,170
This suit is black.

177
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,572
That's a pause. Not!

178
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,576
This suit is black.

179
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,811
Okay, um-

180
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:11,940
- I don't- I don't- I'm not-
- Not!

181
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,681
Everybody say U.S.A. television
much better...

182
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,056
but this I watch for three hours,
do not change.

183
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,425
<i>There's a remote control right here.</i>

184
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,725
You push these two arrows
to change the channel.

185
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:32,196
<i>I got him! I got him!</i>

186
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:35,671
Would you come out in the backyard with me?
I have the urge to bury something else.

187
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:37,469
Yes!

188
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,978
- I love you.
- Oh, I love you too, Jamie.

189
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,641
<i>Oh, I love you.</i>

190
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,668
Do you believe in magic, um, miss-

191
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,670
Parker. C.J.

192
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:09,138
<i>It's a pleasure to meet you, C.J.</i>

193
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,407
<i>Be careful! Be careful, C.J...!</i>

194
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:21,145
<i>This C.J. was like no Kazakh woman</i>
<i>I had ever seen.</i>

195
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,687
<i>She had golden hairs...</i>

196
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,519
<i>teeth as white as pearls...</i>

197
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:30,288
<i>and the asshole of a seven-year-old.</i>

198
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,990
<i>For the first time in my lifes...</i>

199
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,293
<i>I was in love.</i>

200
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,341
Okay.

201
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,422
In Kazakhstan, it is illegal...

202
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:00,356
for more than five woman
to be in the same place...

203
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,189
except for in brothel
or in grave.

204
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:07,664
In U.S. and A., many womens
meet in a groups called feminists.

205
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:11,133
I find-a more. <i>Chenquieh.</i>

206
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:14,797
So what-a means, this "feminism"?

207
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:19,367
<i>It's the theory that women</i>
<i>should be equal to men...</i>

208
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:23,141
<i>in matters economic-</i>

209
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,216
- <i>social and political.</i>
- Now, you are laughing.

210
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,182
- Yeah.
- That is the problem.

211
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,846
<i>Do you think a woman</i>
<i>should be educate?</i>

212
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,855
Definitely.

213
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:35,984
But is it not a problem that the woman
have a smaller brain than the men?

214
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,495
That is wrong.

215
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:41,395
But the government scientist, Dr. Yamak,
have prove it is size of squirrel.

216
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,333
- Your government scientist?
- Yes, Dr. Yamak.

217
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:45,767
He's wrong. He's wrong.

218
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:48,704
Give me a smile, baby. Why angry face?

219
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:52,299
Well, what you're saying
is very demeaning.

220
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,504
- Do you know the word "demeaning"?
- No.

221
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,611
We are saying to you-

222
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:01,152
<i>I could not concentrate</i>
<i>on what this old man was saying.</i>

223
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:02,550
They should get paid-

224
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:05,248
<i>All I could think about</i>
<i>was this lovely woman...</i>

225
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,757
<i>in her red water panties.</i>

226
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,021
<i>Who was this C.J.?</i>

227
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:13,064
Last night I see, in my hotel room...

228
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:17,295
um, a woman called C.J. on television.

229
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,394
- Do you know her?
- No.

230
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:22,702
She-a from a town called Baywatches.

231
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:25,606
- She's just on television.
- Her name is Pamela.

232
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,110
Do she live here in New York City?

233
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,736
- No, no, no.
- She lives in California.

234
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:30,371
Oh, in California.

235
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,575
- He's gonna look her up.
- Okay, are we finished now?

236
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,652
Listen, pussycat, smile a bit.

237
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,277
<i>All right. That's it.</i>

238
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,481
- I'm done.
- Okay, we're finished. We have to leave.

239
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:43,157
<i>Although I was obsessed by this C.J...</i>

240
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,162
<i>I could not pursue her...</i>

241
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:48,961
<i>or else my wife</i>
<i>would snap off my cock.</i>

242
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,265
- Mr. Sagdiyev?
- Yes?

243
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,342
Uh, I have a telegram for you.

244
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,536
Uh, you can read?

245
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,545
Yes, I can.

246
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:04,138
Uh, it's "Dear Borat Sagdiyev...

247
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,241
"your wife, OK- Oksana...

248
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:12,813
"was walking your retarded Bilo
in the woods...

249
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,554
"when a bear attacked
and violated and break her.

250
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,289
She is now dead."

251
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:22,333
Uh, you saying my wife is dead?

252
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,028
This is what it-

253
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,037
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.

254
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,609
Uh, yes, sir.

255
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:37,614
I'm sorry to inform you,
but that's what the telegram says.

256
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:40,014
High five. Great.

257
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,546
<i>Eventually, I persuade Azamat...</i>

258
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,215
<i>that we would travel to California...</i>

259
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,157
<i>and make our reportings</i>
<i>along the way.</i>

260
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,024
<i>He insist we not fly...</i>

261
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:28,327
<i>in case the Jews repeated</i>
<i>their attack of 9/11.</i>

262
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:35,703
My name is Mike. I'm gonna be your driving
instructor. Welcome to our country, okay?

263
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,139
- My name-a Borat.
- Okay, okay. Good, good.

264
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:40,211
I'm not used to that, but that's fine.

265
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:45,250
- Now, you do know how to drive a little bit?
- Yes.

266
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,250
Yes. Put it in "D."

267
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,217
- What?
- Drive.

268
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,622
Now, wait a second. Wait a second.

269
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:56,990
Have you driven a car before?

270
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,563
- Yes, many times.
- Okay, all right. Let's go this way.

271
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,895
Wait a minute. I don't want you
to go hitting anybody.

272
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,264
Use two hands, now.

273
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,997
- What?
- Two hands.

274
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:10,097
But then it look like I am holding
a gypsy while he eat my <i>khram</i>.

275
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,474
I don't care what it looks like.
You use two hands when you drive, okay?

276
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,740
Okay.

277
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,784
Okay.

278
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,753
- Watch the children.
- Okay, no problem.

279
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,982
You must not hit the children.

280
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:29,083
Look, there is a woman in a car!

281
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:31,822
Can we follow her and maybe
make a sexy time with her?

282
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,592
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Not yet, huh? Why not?

283
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,466
Because a woman has a right
to choose who she has sex with.

284
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,629
- What?
- <i>How about that? Isn't that amazing?</i>

285
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,503
- You joke?
- There must be consent.

286
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:46,601
How about that?
That's good, huh?

287
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,942
- Is not good for me.
- <i>No, it is good.</i>

288
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,106
- Steer the car.
- Okay.

289
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:54,049
- Want to have a drink?
- You can't drink that while you're driving.

290
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,814
- It's against the law.
- Why not? What?

291
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,651
Who is this car that follow us?
I wish it didn't follow us anymore.

292
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,251
- Oh, I don't know.
- Maybe we lose them.

293
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,524
No, we better not lose them.

294
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,658
- Hey, don't look at me. Eat my tits!
- All right.

295
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,998
We'll make a right turn up here.

296
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,902
- Don't look at me like that! I will eat your shit.
- Hey, don't do that.

297
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,202
- You fuck my mother.
- Hey, hey. You can't do that.

298
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,834
- No, he do before. He look on me.
- You can't do that, okay?

299
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:23,381
- They're gonna throw us in jail,
me with you. You can't-
- Why in a jail?

300
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,712
He look on me- la-la-la- behind.

301
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,284
<i>You can't say that.</i>

302
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:30,287
- I like you. Do you like me?
- I do like you.

303
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:33,381
- You are my friend?
- You're a nice young man, and I am your friend.

304
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:36,427
- You will be my boyfriend.
- Well- I won't be your boyfriend.

305
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:39,190
- Why not? You do not like me?
- I can be. It depends.

306
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,198
Boyfriend-yeah, I can.

307
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,166
<i>Great success.</i>

308
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:47,500
<i>Now time to make purchase</i>
<i>of motor cars.</i>

309
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:52,043
<i>I want to have a car that attract</i>
<i>a woman with a shave down below.</i>

310
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,170
Well, that would be
a Corvette or a Hummer.

311
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,908
We will try to help you out here.

312
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:03,346
A man yesterday tell me
if I buy a car...

313
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,719
I must buy one with a pussy magnet.

314
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,724
He means a car that women will like.

315
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,556
- Yes, but where you keep this magnet?
- No, there's no magnet.

316
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,596
That was just-
He means the vehicle.

317
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,165
Women love the Hummers.

318
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,734
- Do this have a pussy magnet?
- No.

319
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,666
The vehicle itself will be a magnet.

320
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,102
If I give you good price...

321
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:23,766
will you please put in pussy magnet?

322
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:27,936
Yeah, but there's-there's no such thing
in this country as a- as a... magnet.

323
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:31,709
If this car drive
into a group of gypsy...

324
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:34,047
will there be any damage to the car?

325
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:35,915
It depends on how hard
you hit them and all that.

326
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,683
- Hard.
- It's hard to s-Yeah, hard?

327
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,918
If somebody rolls on the windshield,
they could crack your windshield.

328
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:45,224
How fast do I need to go
to guarantee I kill him?

329
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,230
Let me tell you something.

330
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:49,857
With this vehicle here, probably doing
35, 40 miles an hour would do it.

331
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:50,935
- Great.
- Okay.

332
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,834
- When I buy my wife-
- Mm-hmm.

333
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:58,239
um, at the start, she was cook good...

334
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:01,642
her vagine work well,
and she strong on plow.

335
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:04,716
But after three years,
once she was 15...

336
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,716
then she become weak.

337
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,911
Her voice become-a deep.

It sounds like you
met somebody who is from...

381
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:02,088
what is called in America
"the gay community."

382
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:05,629
- What it mean, "gay," this word "gay"?
- Homosexual.

383
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,290
A homosexual? You mean-

384
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:17,699
Are you telling me the man who tried
to put a rubber fist in my anus...

385
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,709

<i>Even though my anus was broken...</i>

387
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:31,820

<i>Now, one of the things that</i>

<i>We welcome you to the 38th annual...</i>

<i>Kroger Valleydale</i>
<i>Stampede Days Rodeo.</i>

454
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:34,522
Of course, every picture
that we get back...

455
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:39,626
from the terrorists or anything else,
the Muslims, they look like you-

456
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:42,228
- black hair and a black mustache.
- Yes.

457
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:46,367
Shave that dadgum mustache off
so you're not so conspicuous...

458
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:49,935
so you look like maybe
an Italian or something.

459
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:52,414
- Yes.
- As far as when people are looking at you.

460
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,315
I see a lot of people, and I think,
"There's a dadgum Muslim.

461
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,218
I wonder what kind of bomb
he's got strapped to him."

462
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:00,518
- Yes.
- And you probably aren't a Muslim.

463
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,183
Maybe that's not your religion.

464
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:04,454
No, I'm a Kazakh. I follow the hawk.

465
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,530
Yeah, but-but you look
like one of them.

466
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:09,191
This thing gets over with,
and when we win it...

467
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,097
- and kick the butts over there-
- Yes.

468
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:14,103
- All of them son of a bucks
hanging from the gallows.
- Yes!

469
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,469
By that time you will
have proven yourself...

470
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:18,474
and they'll understand,
you'll be accepted.

471
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:19,702
- Take care.
- Thank you.

472
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:22,143
- I ain't gonna kiss you.
- Why not?

473
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:25,842
The people that do the kissing over here
are the ones that float around like that.

474
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,942
- Oh, they all "la-la-la"?
- Yeah, stay away from them that kiss.

475
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,953
- Okay.
- You don't want nobody kissing.

476
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:34,218
In my country, they take them,
and they take them to jail and finish them.

477
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:36,486
- Take 'em out and hang 'em.
- Yes.

478
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:38,323
That's what we're trying
to get done here.

479
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:39,896
- High five.
- Thank you.

00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,000
<i>I was sad.</i>

501
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:06,702
<i>The rodeo peoples did not like me.</i>

502
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:09,211
<i>What if Pamela did not like me too?</i>

503
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:12,214
<i>We needed something</i>
<i>to change our fortunes.</i>

504
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:23,054
Do not fear me, gypsy.
All I want from you is your tears.

505
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:26,790
Please give them to me,
or I will take them.

506
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,798
I'm not a gypsy.

507
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,063
I'm a Midwestern farmer's daughter.
Americana.

508
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:35,071
<i>You have many treasures.</i>
<i>Who did you rob for this?</i>

509
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:38,301
We didn't rob them.
They all came from inside the house.

510
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,969
I will look on your treasures, gypsy.

511
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,877
Is this understood?
I will look on them.

512
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:45,608
Please, do.

513
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:50,578
Who is this lady you have shrunk?

514
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:53,987
Was she the owner of this house
that you camp in front of?

515
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,788
No. There's a couple more child's dolls.

516
00:34:56,894 --> 00:35:00,022
Do not try shrink me, gypsy.
I serious.

517
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:02,599
- These are your spells?
- No.

518
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,691
There's a good one:
<i>The Millionaire Mindset.</i>

519
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,270
- There we go.
- Wa wa wee wa.

520
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:10,636
- <i>Baywatch.</i>
- Baywatch?

521
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,508
It mean she love me.

522
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:24,782
- Azamat!
- Yeah?

523
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,349
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

524
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:59,389
Hey, you!
Hey, stop that goddamn van. Hey!

525
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:04,692
Hey, baby, you want to go out?
You want to go out, honey?

526
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,774
I need the direction
to California, please.

527
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:21,003
- To California?
- You're a long way from home.

528
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:23,580
Who you with, man?
Who you with? Who you with?

529
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:27,674
I with my friend Azamat Bagatov.
We travel across the country.

530
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:29,753
Hold on. Slow down.
Don't be talking all that.

531
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,049
- You got to be talking English around here.
- Who you with?

532
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:34,989
You look like Michael Jackson, "Beat It."

533
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:38,755
Man, you better get your-Aw!

534
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:42,697
I like you peoples.
Can you teach me how to dress?

535
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,893
How can I be like you?

536
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:48,233
- You need to loosen up that belt,
let them jeans down.
- Pull them down?

537
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:50,807
- Don't pull them down like you're gonna go-
- Like a ho?

538
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:52,808
- No, no, no, no.
- Like this?

539
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:56,038
- Yeah, yeah.
- But don't show your Huggies though, man.

540
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:57,978
<i>What the hell?</i>

541
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:00,312
- Is that fishnet?
- <i>No, no, no.</i>

542
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:02,079
These are my underpants.

543
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:05,053
- What kind of music you listen to?
- I like very much Kokibuchuk.

544
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:06,817
You know Kokibuchuk?

545
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:11,056
No, no, no.

546
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,234
Can you teach me speak like you?

547
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:20,702
- What you trying to say?
- How you say, "How do you do?"

548
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:21,999
What's up wit it?

549
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:23,903
- What's that with it?
- Yeah.

550
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:38,152
What's up with it, Vanilla Face?

551
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,316
Me and my homey Azamat
just parked our slab outside.

552
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,983
Please.

553
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:46,325
We're looking for somewhere
to post up our black asses for the night.

554
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:50,127
So, uh, bang, bang, skid, skid, nigga.

555
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:52,168
We're just a couple of pimps, no hos.

556
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,238
- Sir, sir, you got to leave.
- Okay.

557
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:57,307
Either leave now, or we're gonna call
the cops and we'll have you taken out.

558
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,746
- Hi.
- Thank you. You have room for tonight?

559
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:14,518
- Oh, yes. Definitely.
- Yes.

560
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,183
- Come on in.
- Great.

561
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,228
- So, come on in.
- Come on in.

562
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:19,990
- <i>Your friend also.</i>
- Thank you.

563
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:23,799
- Oh, is beautiful houses.
- All the paint-

564
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:26,995
All the paintings in the house I did.

565
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:29,231
<i>What is this man?</i>

566
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:33,037
This is a Yemenite Jew,
and he's working on a piece of jewelry.

567
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:36,113
The Yemenites-

568
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:38,647
were also jewelers.

569
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:41,217
Why you have a picture of a Jew?

570
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,219
Because I'm Jewish...

571
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:47,485
<i>so I have lots of pictures of Jews.</i>

572
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,563
<i>Um, this is the room.</i>

573
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:59,193
And, uh, do you need two pillows?

574
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:00,930
Uh, yes.

575
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:03,233
Great. Thank you. Lovely place.

576
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:15,611
Aah!

577
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,355
Shh!

578
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,526
Um- Um-

579
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:27,722
- <i>Wait, wait.</i>
- Okay.

580
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,665
Oh, hello.

581
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:33,862
- How are you?
- Great.

582
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:35,996
You getting settled in?

583
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:39,235
This is a special sandwich for you.

584
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:41,072
- I, uh, not so hungry.
- Thank you.

585
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,373
He can eat this.

586
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:44,778
He, uh, fat.

587
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:47,248
No, no, thank you.

588
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:49,012
- You better eat because-
- Take a half.

589
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,485
- You take a half.
- Take a half.

590
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:53,557
- Just a half, and then you'll see.
- Uh, I not so hungry.

591
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:56,285
Yeah, yeah, eat a little bit.

592
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,724
Go ahead and eat something because
you're hungry, and you're a guest.

593
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,733
Yes.

594
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,605
I don't want to see you go hungry.

595
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:18,514
What is this picture over here?

596
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:19,844
Okay.

597
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,218
It is 3:00 in the morning.

598
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:32,056
I am in the nest of Jews.

599
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:34,791
They have cleverly shifted their shapes.

600
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:39,598
One of them has taken the form
of a little old woman.

601
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:42,365
You can barely see her horns.

602
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:46,601
She have tried to poison me already.

603
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,678
These rats are very clever.

604
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:54,513
What is that? What?

605
00:40:58,088 --> 00:40:59,953
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

606
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:47,733
What is the best gun
to defend from a Jew?

607
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:54,576
I would, uh, recommend either
a nine-millimeter or a .45.

608
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,748
Very nice.

609
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,783
Wa wa woo wa.

610
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:04,946
It like I, uh, movie star, Dirty Harold.

611
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:08,855
- Yes, sir.
- Come on and make my day, Jew.

612
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:14,127
<i>But he would not sell me gun</i>
<i>since I'm not American.</i>

613
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:16,358
<i>So I look for other protection.</i>

614
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:22,704
- What type of dog is this?
- This is a tortoise.

615
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:26,298
<i>Is this a cat in a hat?</i>

616
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:28,674
- No.
- No, it's a tortoise in a shell.

617
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:29,973
Yes.

618
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,106
I need animal for protection.

619
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,117
What you have for me?

620
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:07,073
High five! Great. Nice.

621
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,279
<i>Happy times.</i>

622
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:45,014
<i>We were safe</i>
<i>and well on our way to Pamela.</i>

623
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,818
<i>It was time to get back to work.</i>

624
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:08,208
Hello. Nice meet you.

625
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:11,645
Hello. It's so nice to meet you.
Welcome to America.

626
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:17,244
Will you please teach me
how to dine like gentleman?

627
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:19,481
Of course. I'll be happy to.

628
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:25,792
<i>Is it polite to greet people</i>
<i>when I make entry?</i>

629
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:28,023
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

630
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:30,498
- Let me introduce you... around.
- Yes.

631
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:33,092
- You're gonna have to say names.
- I'm Mike. Mike Jerrod.

632
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:37,870
Hello. I'm Bethany Weston.

633
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:40,409
- It's lovely to see you.
- Yes. How do you do?

634
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,638
How do you do?
My name is Ben.

635
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:46,840
Should I pay interest...

636
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:50,545
in peoples around the table sides?

637
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:51,951
Yes.

638
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:55,685
And if it is a big table,
a very long table...

639
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:58,091
you might want to restrict
your conversation-

640
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,925
- Yes.
- to people right in your vicinity.

641
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:04,194
- Very nice.
- So you are not yelling.

642
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:09,968
What do you do?

643
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:11,632
I'm the pastor of a church.

644
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:14,074
<i>Yes. What do you do?</i>

645
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:16,703
<i>I have spent years in construction.</i>

646
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:20,045
Um, I've recently retired.

647
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,482
- You are retard?
- Uh, yes. And now-

648
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:26,613
- Uh, physical or mental?
- <i>Retired.</i>

649
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,385
- Retired.
- No, no, not retard-

650
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:30,221
Um, I don't work anymore.

651
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:31,760
- Stopped working.
- Stopped working.

652
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:35,127
Is very good you allow...

653
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:38,292
a retard to eat with you...

654
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,336
in the same place.

655
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:42,496
<i>That's not what</i>
<i>we're saying about this man.</i>

656
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:45,439
He is not what you would...

657
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:47,339
re- refer to as retard.

658
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:49,275
- <i>No.</i>
- No.

659
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:51,609
No, no, not at all.

660
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:53,774
Do you have a telephone
in this village?

661
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:55,078
- Um-
- <i>Of course.</i>

662
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,750
Should I show photos of my family?

663
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:07,831
You have photos of your family?
Wonderful.

664
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,898
Uh, this my favorite son,
Hooeylewis.

665
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:14,300
- Okay.
- <i>Yes.</i>

666
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:16,133
- He looks happy.
- <i>Yes.</i>

667
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:19,706
He very strong.

668
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:22,370
My goodness.
Is that him holding you?

669
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:24,379
- Yes. Very strong.
- Goodness.

670
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:28,110
<i>He grow-a three centimeter.</i>
<i>He now 17 centimeter long.</i>

671
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:29,651
Oh, okay.

672
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:31,880
I'm not sure I would show...

673
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,549
these photos of him
without clothes on.

674
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:38,958
Should I pay compliments
to the peoples?

675
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:41,690
Yes, but only if...

676
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,393
you truly agree with that compliment.

677
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:48,460
You have very gentle face...

678
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:51,700
and a very erotic physique.

679
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,709
- Thank you.
- <i>You're correct.</i>

680
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,575
That's a very good observation.

681
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,138
- She is your wife?
- No, that's my wife.

682
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,150
<i>In my country...</i>

683
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:05,415
they would go crazy-

684
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:06,682
for these two.

685
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,052
Not so much-

686
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,061
<i>Wa wa wee wa.</i>

687
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,791
What should I say...

688
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:18,732
if I need to go to the shithole?

689
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,997
Uh, you mean to the restroom?

690
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:23,572
- To the place to make the shit.
- The bathroom.

691
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,574
- Okay. What you-
- Not a bath-

692
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,576
- To make dirt from anus.
- Not a bath, right.

693
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,441
- The brown-
- The toilet.

694
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:31,537
- Where you make, uh-You understand?
- Yes.

695
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:34,947
- Bad- Bad- Bad thing from it.
- Yes. Yes.

696
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:37,748
- Uh, what you do is you say-
- Brown.

697
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:41,188
"Excuse me.
I need to go to the restroom."

698
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:43,259
Excuse me.

699
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:47,262
Is it possible to go and do a-you-

700
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,559
- <i>To be excused?</i>
- How you say in the, you know-

701
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:53,067
- Upstairs. Just say, "Excuse me a moment."
- How you say it?

702
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,070
- I need to do, uh-
- That works. Thank you.

703
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:57,140
- What you say in-
- <i>You go upstairs.</i>

704
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:58,708
Yes. Thank you.

705
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:02,677
<i>I think that the cultural differences...</i>

706
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:05,373
are vast.

707
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:07,950
- Exactly.
- And I think he's a delightful man.

708
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:11,020
And it wouldn't take very much time...

709
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:14,955
for him to really become Americanized.

710
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:17,754
Thank you very much. I feel much better.
Cindy, where shall I put this?

711
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:20,659
- Just, uh-
- Where shall I put this?

712
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:24,825
Oh, um-

713
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:27,836
<i>Maybe in the other-</i>
<i>in the other room for a minute.</i>

714
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:29,428
- <i>In... the-</i>
- In the-

715
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:33,600
- I do not want the-
- Excuse me. Excuse me for just a moment, please.

716
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:37,146
You roll off... like this...

717
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,215
and you wipe your bottom...

718
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:40,908
and you put the paper- Look!

719
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:43,486
- I-You wipe mine?
- You! No, I don't. You do.

720
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,555
This is a very private thing.

721
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:47,681
The host cleans the anus of the other?

722
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:49,486
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

723
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,925
Nobody touches you except you.

724
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:55,157
Can I bring a guest to dinner?

725
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:58,757
If you have been invited
to a home or to a party-

726
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:00,200
Yes.

727
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:02,568
uh, it is acceptable
to bring a guest...

728
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:05,972
- if you ask your host in advance.
- Yes.

729
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:08,101
Well, Stonewall Jackson, Robert E. Lee.

730
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:09,769
Oh, wait. It is my friend.

731
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,781
- Hello?
- Hi. I'm looking for Borat.

732
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:14,976
- Yes, is me. Yeah.
- Oh, hi, honey.

733
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:16,950
- I'm Luenell.
- Oh, hello.

734
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:18,954
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

735
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:21,286
- This my friend Luenell.
- Hi.

736
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:23,518
Oh, okay. Um-

737
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:27,495
<i>Mm, mm. Y'all having a dinner party.</i>

738
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:31,226
Well, we were. I-I don't know
exactly what all that we're doing.

739
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:33,235
It is getting very, very late.

740
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:35,601
You'll have to excuse me.
I'm gonna have to go home.

741
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:38,334
- Okay. Very nice.
- It's getting very, very late.

742
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:41,434
And it's- it's time
that the, uh, you know...

743
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:45,072
- that we were ending our dinner party.
- <i>Oh.</i>

744
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:48,083
- I apologi-
- But can she come for desserts?

745
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:50,710
Absolutely not, and neither can you.

746
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,948
<i>The sheriff is on his way.</i>
<i>The police are coming now.</i>

747
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:55,047
- <i>I hope so. Thank you.</i>
- <i>I've already called the police.</i>

748
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:58,389
<i>Why you call police?</i>
<i>Have the retard escaped?</i>

749
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:03,126
I want say I very sorry...

750
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:05,224
how they treat you in this house.

751
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,700
<i>Thank you.</i>

752
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:08,737
<i>I was thinking maybe I'd just...</i>

753
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,670
take the night off and-

754
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:12,708
Why don't we just go out
and have some fun?

755
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:14,743
<i>What do you think about that?</i>

756
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:32,094
- Hi. My name Borat.
- How you doing?

757
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,095
- This my friend Luenell.
- Hi, Luenell.

758
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,791
- She is a prostitute.
- Oh!

759
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,034
Oh!

760
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:56,717
You were funny on those bulls.

761
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:59,516
Everybody almost see your underpants.

762
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:01,614
I never rode a bull before.

763
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,718
Um-

764
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:08,821
Well, you want to-you want to
come in for a little while?

765
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:12,959
I would like very much...

766
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:16,198
but I in love
with a woman in Malibu.

767
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:19,298
It would not be nice to her
for me to-

768
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,809
Okay, well,
if you're ever in town again...

769
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,846
this way, you know, look me up.

770
00:51:23,947 --> 00:51:26,882
If I ever in town again, Luenell...

771
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:29,451
I would very much like
to pay you for sex.

772
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:30,713
Okay.

773
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,120
Good night, Luenells.

774
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:36,624
Good night, Borat.

775
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,060
You say my name right. Borat.

776
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:50,003
People say Borak or Billy or Bob.

777
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:53,441
Bye.

778
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:07,785
<i>"Pamela is a fairly simple girl.</i>

779
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:10,155
"She recently explained...

780
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,160
"'There's not a whole lot of logic...

781
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:14,822
"'in the way I live my life.

782
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:17,559
I am very spontaneous."'

783
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:19,635
I'm very spontaneous too.

784
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:42,214
<i>I needed a gift to give to Pamela...</i>

785
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:46,091
<i>so that she would grant me entry</i>
<i>into her vagine.</i>

786
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:48,426
<i>Therefore, I convinced Azamat...</i>

787
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:52,730
<i>to let me film a report</i>
<i>in an American store.</i>

788
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,507
<i>Uh, this your shops?</i>

789
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:02,077
Right. This is my antique shop.

790
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:05,512
<i>Why do you have so many things with a flag?</i>

791
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:07,845
<i>We're honoring our heritage.</i>

792
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:12,081
And what, uh, in here?
What is this?

793
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,157
These are a number of collectibles.

794
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:17,920
I mean, this is a- this is a lamp that,
you know, you would use in your home.

795
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:20,861
This is a Chinese cloisonné bell.

796
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:25,367
And this is a-just a, uh-
a little decorative duck.

797
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:28,596
And do you think, um,
you know, when they-

798
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:35,111
I'm sorry. Wait. Wait.

799
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:41,480
- <i>We need help, baby.</i>
- <i>No, it's okay.</i>

800
00:53:45,188 --> 00:53:46,712
I sorry.

801
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:53,260
Sorry. I will, uh, repair all of this.

802
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:55,490
<i>Don't worry.</i>

803
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,090
My friend, he can make glue.

804
00:53:58,201 --> 00:54:00,601
I don't think you're gonna be able
to glue that stuff back.

805
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:03,264
I think you're gonna have to pay for it.

806
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:06,001
Okay, I have digital watch from future.
I will give you.

807
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:07,770
Is worth more than all of this.

808
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:10,778
You broke $425 worth of stuff.

809
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,976
160, 170, 180.

810
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,110
That's not enough.

811
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,120
Do you want hair?
This is very good-

812
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:20,849
No, I don't want any damn hair.

813
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:23,152
This is the best hair in Kazakhstan.
Feel the quality.

814
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,785
- I don't want your damn hair. We don't-
- This hair from pubis.

815
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:28,227
I can get you, uh, 2,000 bags
by next Friday.

816
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:30,458
We don't use that stuff in this country.

817
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,766
Just give me another 20.
That's good enough.

818
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:44,646
Would you have believed this
if I had told you?

819
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:48,047
- All right, go! Go! Go!
- Okay?

820
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,934
Oh! Holy sheeze. Ow.

821
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:23,165
Okay. Um-

822
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:24,934
Um-

823
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:51,127
We have a special guest here this evening.
Uh, Ruth Feiner is here.

824
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:11,347
What are you doing? Come on. Cut it out!

825
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:19,322
- Just walk 'em out.
- Get the fuck out of here!

826
00:58:29,569 --> 00:58:33,096
So, um, bad news.

827
00:58:33,206 --> 00:58:36,767
Azamat have, uh, leave.

828
00:58:36,876 --> 00:58:39,276
I wake up, he disappear...

829
00:58:39,379 --> 00:58:43,509
and he take... Oksana...

830
00:58:43,616 --> 00:58:46,949
my bear- our bear.

831
00:58:47,053 --> 00:58:50,022
And he also decide to take all money...

832
00:58:50,123 --> 00:58:52,250
and also my passport.

833
00:58:56,229 --> 00:58:58,527
And, um...

834
00:58:58,631 --> 00:59:00,531
he leave me...

835
00:59:01,568 --> 00:59:04,196
only this bag...

836
00:59:04,304 --> 00:59:06,272
with a hen...

837
00:59:07,974 --> 00:59:09,874
and, uh...

838
00:59:11,244 --> 00:59:14,145
ticket to Kazakhstan...

839
00:59:15,348 --> 00:59:17,316
but no passport.

840
00:59:19,285 --> 00:59:21,412

Make it without Azamat.

847
00:59:53,686 --> 00:59:57,713
I think will be better,
and I will have more success...

848
00:59:57,824 --> 00:59:59,724
without him.

849
01:00:00,793 --> 01:00:02,693

900
01:03:26,299 --> 01:03:28,164

01:03:39,979 --> 01:03:42,379
- Big shame. Big shame.
- It would be better country if-

906
01:03:42,482 --> 01:03:45,474
There-Yes, it would be a better country.
We should have slaves.

907
01:03:45,585 --> 01:03:49,248
Our country, the minorities
actually have more power.

908
01:03:49,355 --> 01:03:53,416
Anyone that is minority
has the-the, uh, upper hand.

909
01:03:53,526 --> 01:03:57,860
We have the Jews. We have anybody
that's against the mainstream.

I will take her virgin

01:04:34,133 --> 01:04:36,465
- She's sucking some dick, man.
- <i>Do you see her sucking dick?</i>

925
01:04:36,569 --> 01:04:38,628
This is not her.

926
01:04:38,738 --> 01:04:42,139
I guarantee that that shit's gonna happen.
Don't worry about it.

927
01:04:42,241 --> 01:04:44,141
<i>That's her, Borak. Sorry.</i>

928
01:04:44,243 --> 01:04:47,076

- Come on, Boris.

935
01:04:59,892 --> 01:05:02,292
- Stay with us, buddy. Boris, stay strong.
- We love you.

936
01:05:02,395 --> 01:05:04,295
- We'll remember you always.
- <i>Boris!</i>

937
01:05:04,397 --> 01:05:06,661

01:05:06,766 --> 01:05:09,200
Hey. Hey. You're in America now.

You'll make it.
You keep going, okay?

940
01:05:11,938 --> 01:05:13,838
- You are bigger than a woman.
- You keep going.

941
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:15,840
- You are better than a woman.
- I go back to New York.

942
01:05:15,942 --> 01:05:17,910
We will always be behind you.

943
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:20,911
Do not let a woman ever, ever...

944
01:05:21,013 --> 01:05:22,913
make you who you are.

945
01:05:23,015 --> 01:05:25,313
- Good-bye, my friends.
- Good-bye.

946
01:06:04,123 --> 01:06:05,715
My ticket!

947
01:06:23,409 --> 01:06:26,003
I sorry, my friend.

948
01:06:34,954 --> 01:06:36,353
Go.

949
01:06:36,455 --> 01:06:39,151
Go.

950
01:06:39,258 --> 01:06:40,850
Run to freedom.

951
01:06:42,028 --> 01:06:45,520
Go! Go! Live your life!

952
01:07:31,977 --> 01:07:34,377
Yes!

953
01:07:35,948 --> 01:07:37,575
Come on!

954
01:07:40,086 --> 01:07:41,815
It is good to be here.

955
01:07:41,921 --> 01:07:45,948
This is my 10th Pentecostal
camp meeting- a decade.

956
01:07:48,427 --> 01:07:50,054
<i>The bottom line is:</i>

957
01:07:50,162 --> 01:07:52,528
we are a Christian nation now...

958
01:07:52,631 --> 01:07:54,599
we were a Christian nation
in the beginning...

959
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:56,565
<i>and we're gonna always be</i>
<i>a Christian nation...</i>

960
01:07:56,669 --> 01:07:58,398
until the good Lord returns.

961
01:07:58,504 --> 01:07:59,596
<i>Amen.</i>

962
01:08:01,941 --> 01:08:04,273
I didn't evolve out of a monkey.

963
01:08:04,376 --> 01:08:07,470
I didn't used to be a tadpole.
I is what I is.

964
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:09,480
Praise you, Jesus.

965
01:08:09,582 --> 01:08:12,608
<i>The Bible says that God</i>
<i>was manifest in the flesh...</i>

966
01:08:12,718 --> 01:08:15,653
<i>and believed all in the world!</i>

967
01:08:15,755 --> 01:08:19,213
I got good news:
Jesus is God in the flesh!

968
01:08:26,732 --> 01:08:29,724
I don't care what the devil's done to you
or what he's trying to do.

969
01:08:29,835 --> 01:08:32,065
All you gotta do is step out
of that aisle now...

970
01:08:32,171 --> 01:08:34,002
and make your way
down to this altar.

971
01:08:34,106 --> 01:08:37,041
<i>Let's have a little</i>
<i>old-time church right now.</i>

972
01:08:37,143 --> 01:08:39,941
I need somebody to pray with me
right now. Come on, sir!

973
01:08:40,045 --> 01:08:43,879
The blood over my neighbor!
I bleed the blood over my church!

974
01:08:47,086 --> 01:08:49,452
I want you to help save me, please.

975
01:08:49,555 --> 01:08:52,786
Ladies and gentlemen,
the gentleman here...

977
01:08:55,094 --> 01:08:58,359

978
01:08:58,464 --> 01:09:00,056
- Jesus!
- Thank you.

979
01:09:02,735 --> 01:09:06,193
I have no friends.
I am alone in this country.

980
01:09:06,305 --> 01:09:07,932
Nobody like me.

981
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:09,940

and he leave me alone.

983
01:09:13,145 --> 01:09:15,841
<i>Not only this.</i>

987
01:09:26,458 --> 01:09:28,926
Is there anybody who can help me?

988
01:09:29,028 --> 01:09:30,393
Yes.

989
01:09:30,496 --> 01:09:33,522

He loves your brother Bilo.

996
01:09:48,414 --> 01:09:51,975
Do Jesus love my neighbor

01:09:52,084 --> 01:09:53,711
Yes, he loves everybody.

998

01:09:58,557 --> 01:10:02,550
Can Jesus heal the pain
that is in my heart?

1000
01:10:02,661 --> 01:10:05,186
<i>Jesus can heal your pain in your heart!</i>
