<i>The year 1600...</i>

<i>The victor at the Battle of Sekigahara

00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:16,911

TOKUGAWA IEYASU

00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:21,541
<i>TOKUGAWA IEYASU
But the son of his rival Hideyoshi still lives...</i>

7
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:24,877
<i>But the son of his rival Hideyoshi still lives...</i>

8
00:01:25,253 --> 00:01:29,757
<i>Hideyori, from his stronghold

00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:43,980
<i>Ieyasu is finally ready to challenge him
at Osaka, and marches toward the castle.</i>

15
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:50,403
Someone help me!

16
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:52,989
Omitsu's in there!

17
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:54,907
She all right?
- Don't know.

18
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:56,576
How many are inside?

19
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:59,704
Just one, but he fights like a monkey!

20
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:02,165
We can't see what's going on in there!

21
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:04,167
What is going on?

22
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:05,918
Help me!

23
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:09,922
Hey stranger, you stay out of here!

24
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:11,174
Help, please!

25
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:13,259
Don't you care what happens to her?

26
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:17,221
They say you claim to be from Sogabedono.

27
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,767
Used some ruse to steal money from the village.

28
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:25,104
When they stalled you took her hostage.

29
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:27,315
So what?

30
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:31,653
So release the girl.

31
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:34,864
I will replace her as your hostage.

32
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:35,990
Please!

33
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,535
My name is Sanada Saemonnosuke Yukimura!

34
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:41,913
SANADA SAEMONNOSUKE YUKIMURA
My name is Sanada Saemonnosuke Yukimura!

35
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,499
What?
You're that famous samurai?

36
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,292
How about it?

37
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:50,213
You'll pocket a much bigger ransom for me.

38
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:51,798
That's right!

39
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:55,009
Watch out!

40
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:56,969
MURAMASA SWORD

41
00:02:58,513 --> 00:03:00,098
Young girl...

42
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:02,058
Go home!

43
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:06,646
Damn you!

44
00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:10,817
Well, what would you like to do now?

45
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,819
Start a barbecue?

46
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:27,875
No damn good!

47
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:31,838
I'm sure it's some fancy samurai trick.

48
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:35,591
That's it, I'll just surrender!

49
00:03:35,675 --> 00:03:39,554
Damn, this always happens.

50
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:43,850
But I don't have any tricks up my sleeve.

51
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,602
You quit too easily.

52
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:47,895
What?

53
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,523
I'm just an ordinary man.

54
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:57,739
Not the most skillful blade
on Earth by any means.

55
00:03:57,864 --> 00:04:01,200
But your reputation!
Everyone looks up to you.

56
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:06,914
I don't deserve it any more
than that helpless girl.

57
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:10,918
Dying by the sword would be a dream for me.

58
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:12,336
What?

59
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,882
Should I make your dream come true?

60
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:37,278
Phony hero with a death wish?

61
00:04:37,612 --> 00:04:39,989
Why not fight in this war?

62
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:44,577
Play the hero.
Make use of your fat reputation.

63
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:47,580
What are you saying?

64
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,081
Never mind, never mind.

65
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:53,085
First take me, Sarutobi Sasuke
as your loyal follower!

66
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:01,052
Right, this will be a hoot!

67
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:02,386
FIRST BRAVE SOLDIER OF SANADA

68
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:09,602
Oops!

69
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:11,813
You there!

70
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:15,608
Lay down all your cash!

71
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,445
Here I come, bandits!

72
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:48,683
Long time no see, Sasuke.

73
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,644
What brings you to my little forest?

74
00:05:54,647 --> 00:05:57,316
Sanada is joining the war.

75
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,777
What? Sanada's fighting?

76
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,529
Want to join?

77
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:04,657
SECOND, THIRD AND FOURTH
BRAVE SOLDIERS OF SANADA

78
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,201
Anyone home?

79
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:11,873
Hey, what do you want?

80
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:15,251
My name's Yuri Kamanosuke.

81
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:18,462
Sir Sanada's gathering brave
men for the coming war.

82
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:20,506
I've come to join them.

83
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:36,856
I admire your skills.

84
00:06:40,693 --> 00:06:42,486
Where did you work before?

85
00:06:42,612 --> 00:06:48,367
I served the Sir Yukita of Bizen during
the last war as a guard and a messenger.

86
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:49,660
Thanks!

87
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:52,705
But you look too young
to be a Sekigahara veteran.

88
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:54,206
I do.

89
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,500
Yes, Saizo...

90
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:59,754
We need a few more strange guys like this one.

91
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:04,926
It will start rumors about Sanada,
give our soldiers an air of mystery.

92
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:06,761
Like that?

93
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:09,639
FIFTH BRAVE SOLDIER OF SANADA

94
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:11,182

00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:37,416
I'm here!
To give you a hand.

102
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:46,884
Still here, mister?

103
00:07:51,222 --> 00:07:53,516
Pull back!

104
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:55,685
Retreat!

105
00:07:57,645 --> 00:07:59,647
All right!

106
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,859
Ninja powder, that's so old school!

107
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:09,907
Just some red pepper
for doctoring cheap saké.

108
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:14,912
I'm the actor that plays female roles Kakei Juzo.

109
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:18,124
I want to join Sanada Saemonnosuke's brave men.

110
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:20,292
You're in!

111
00:08:20,793 --> 00:08:22,586
All right!

112
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:23,879
SIXTH BRAVE SOLDIER OF SANADA

113
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,853
Enough, that's good for now.

114
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:45,568
Mochizuki, great job showing Daisuke the ropes.

115
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,112
Thank you so much.

116
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:51,741
Thank you, I'm proud to serve.

117
00:08:52,408 --> 00:08:57,413
I'm trying to learn fast, and
make you proud of me, father.

118
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:01,333
Please let me be a brave soldier.

119
00:09:05,004 --> 00:09:06,380
He's good.

120
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:11,427
SEVENTH AND EIGHTH
BRAVE SOLDIERS OF SANADA

121
00:09:14,472 --> 00:09:18,059
Hmm, no rice...

122
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:24,106
Out of miso paste.
What will we do?

123
00:09:27,485 --> 00:09:30,196
What do you want?
- Follow me.

124
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,907
Son of a bitch!

125
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:36,035
Give that back!

126
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:46,712
Punk, I will nail you!

127
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:48,464
Well he's pretty good.

128
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:49,882
What?

129
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,637
Looks like he's number nine!

130
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:56,555
NINTH BRAVE SOLDIER OF SANADA

131
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:59,058
Nine brave soldiers assemble!

We'll make the world more interesting!

134
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:17,368
Unfortunate but inescapable, air to earth.

135
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:20,538
I jump from a cloud into a billow of smoke.

136
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,164
Kirigakure Saizo!

137
00:10:22,248 --> 00:10:25,584

Former entertainer and smiling killer.

142
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:39,098
Open minded and brave hearted.

143
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,183
Kakei Juzo!

144
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:45,437
Sanada's accountant, fastest
calculation with pen and sword.

145
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,940
Studious and honest, Unno Rokuro!

146
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,944
I'm the youngest, I pledge
myself to making Sanada proud.

147
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:53,320
Sanada Daisuke!

148
00:10:53,404 --> 00:10:58,909
I'd do anything for young Daisuke
as his sword instructor!

149
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:00,411
Mochizuki Rokuro!

150
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:03,747
My home is in the heat of battle.

Yuri Kamanosuke!

152

Truth or lies?
Follow me and find out!

153
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:12,798
I'm phantasmagoria!
Sarutobi Sasuke!

154
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:19,805
Ieyasu! Get ready!

155

LADY YODO
Tokugawa leyasu is coming?

158
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:40,326
LADY YODO

159
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:42,453

162
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:50,669
But Lord Hideyori must be protected.

163
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:56,175
No matter what becomes of us.

164
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:58,636
You heard?

165
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:00,512
Nine brave Sanada men?

166
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,014
They're very strong?

167
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:03,307
They're the strongest!

168
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:04,725
Nine brave soldiers?

169
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,185
Tokugawa's army?

170
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:07,603
Better watch out!

171
00:12:08,062 --> 00:12:10,731
Will Sanada rise up?

172
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:14,401
Everyone says he's sharp as they come.

173
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:16,028
I'm Sanada Saemonnosuke!

174

Let's go!

177
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:25,746
Rumor has it nine brave men
will fight alongside him.

178
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,289
Enough of this!

179
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:32,711
And all of Osaka is waiting for them.

180
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,342
All of you, find Sanada right away!

181
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,052
Yes, my lady!

182
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,681
KUDOYAMA MOUNTAIN, KISHU

183

SANADA RESIDENCE

184
00:12:56,277 --> 00:13:03,242
So, I hear you're rousing
the people to go to war.

185
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:06,245
Well, sort of.

186
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,623
Sort of?

187
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:15,129
You're not getting cold feet?

188
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:18,674
No, but...

189
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,926
Don't say but!

190
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:27,057
SUNPU CASTLE

191
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:41,905
My lord,

192
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:42,114
the indecisive Sanada seems to be preparing for war at last.

193
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:44,658
HONDA MASAZUMI YAGYU TAJIMA-NO-KAMI MUNENORI
the indecisive Sanada seems to be preparing for war at last.

194
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:48,495
The indecisive Sanada seems to be preparing for war at last.

195
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:59,673
Now my war of conquest may proceed.

196
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:07,639
Men of Sanada, we march!

197
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:17,441
<i>So Sanada Yukimura was finally
convinced to march to Osaka and join the war.</i>

198
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:23,989
<i>Goto Matabei, Mori Katsunaga,
and Chosokabe Morichika,</i>

199
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:27,451
<i>brought their soldiers to Osaka Castle as well.</i>

200
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:30,621
<i>Some 100,000 men joined their cause.</i>

201
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,541
<i>Winter, the year 1614...</i>

202
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:40,255
<i>Toyotomi and Tokugawa clans
were poised to engage in battle.</i>

203
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,100
Sanada Saemonnosuke is coming!

204
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:53,352
He's coming!

205
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:03,779
What a quaint castle!

206
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:07,241
I think it's called impenetrable.

207
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:09,660
Saemonnosuke is that you?

208
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:12,079
I'm Goto Matabei Mototsugu.

209
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,206
GOTO MATABEI MOTOTSUGU
I'm Goto Matabei Mototsugu.

210
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:14,248
I'm Goto Matabei Mototsugu.

211
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:14,581
MORI KATSUNAGA

212
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:15,499
MORI KATSUNAGA I'm Mori Katsunaga.
- Chosokabe Morichika.

213
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:15,624
I'm Mori Katsunaga.
- Chosokabe Morichika.

214
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:17,292
CHOSOKABE MORICHIKA I'm Mori
Katsunaga. - Chosokabe Morichika.

215
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,586
Glad you're all here.

216
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:20,963
See?

217
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:25,634
Now that Sir Sanada has come,
our defenders are revitalized!

218
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:27,177
Everybody!

219
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:33,892
Let's stand together, fight for our late master!

220
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,730
Are these the nine brave soldiers we've heard of?

221
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:43,110
They don't look much like brave samurai to me.

222
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:51,493
Hey, what is he up to?

223
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,589
Look!

224
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:18,479
SANADA ENCAMPMENT

225
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:21,356
SANADA ENCAMPMENT Did you know that old bastard
leyasu attacked his son Hidetadafs troops

226
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:22,608
Did you know that old bastard leyasu
attacked his son Hidetada's troops

227
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:25,486
to fool the enemy at The Battle of Ueda.

228
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:27,070
That was...

229
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:31,783
Of course. Ieyasu drew their
attention to Hidetada's weakness

230
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:34,161
in order to pull his enemies closer.

231
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:42,252
Everyone believes that story,
but it's not the real truth.

232
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:51,011
It was just a coincidence that we were
attacked at the rear of the castle.

233
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:56,767
So by accident in our forced retreat, we
ran for our lives right into Hidetada's men.

234
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:59,895
So accidentally Hidetada
began this famous skirmish!

235
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:03,649
By accident!
But his forces were already weak!

236
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:05,984
So accidentally, you lived to tell the story.

237
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,278
It's my face.

238
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:13,408
Just because I look the part,

239
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:17,829
everyone thinks I ran boldly into the fight.

240
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:25,379
It's a burden to look so fine.

241
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:28,840
Just like me!

242
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:36,807
My son Daisuke trusts everyone,
believes everything they say.

243
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:39,851
What will I do?

244
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,604
Don't worry.

245
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:49,528
Keep lying, and someday
our lies will all come true.

246
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:56,618
If we lie forever it will be 100
years before anybody finds out.

247
00:17:57,411 --> 00:18:02,207
What will we say at the strategy session?

248
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:06,712
No need to worry.

249
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:10,507
We'll handle all of that.

250
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:13,468
That's fine by me.

251
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:10,651
Brave soldier Nezu Jinpachi.

252
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:14,905
Good luck!

253
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:37,344
What?

254
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,638
You're saying we should hide in the castle?

255
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:40,514
TOYOTOMI MILITARY COUNCIL
You're saying we should hide in the castle?

256
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:40,972
TOYOTOMI MILITARY COUNCIL

257
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:44,518
TOYOTOMI MILITARY COUNCIL We have enough
food and water to withstand a 10-year siege!

258
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:45,769
We have enough food and
water to withstand a 10-year siege!

259
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:52,901
Even Ieyasu can't sustain armies that long!

260
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:57,572
Ieyasu will die waiting!

261
00:19:57,698 --> 00:20:02,494
Lord Hideyori, your mother agrees with you.

262
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:07,332
In the long run, your enemy...

263
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,209
Testing! Can you hear?

264
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:11,712
...will run out of steam!

265
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,382
Soon, Goto Matabei will ask for your advice.

266
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:17,676
When called on you'll say this.

267
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:21,930
Without courage, we can never win this war!

268
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:24,891
You understand?

269
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:29,354
Sanada Saemonnosuke, what do you say?

270
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,943
Say it!

271
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:44,161
Without courage, we'll never win this war!

272
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:49,750
Good answer!
- Just what we expect from Sir Sanada!

273
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,878
Now, you'll excuse yourself, saying...

274
00:20:53,587 --> 00:21:01,511
This proud, historic castle will never fall!

275
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:06,558
Long as Lord Hideyori agrees
with the plan we've adopted.

276
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:13,231
I, Saemonnosuke will stand by you all.

277
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:18,487
Saemonnosuke, we thank you.

278
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:24,242
Pretty nice job.

279
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:28,997
Nice job for us, but there's
one weak point in the castle.

280
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:31,041
A weak point?

281
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,461
There's a vulnerable spot at
the south side of the castle.

282
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:41,593
Certainly Osaka Castle is the
best castle in the south side...

283
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:43,386
What?
- Idiot!

284
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:44,971
Idiot!

285
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:51,186
But there's a weak spot in the south.

286
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,480
What weak spot?

287
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:59,277
The south side of the castle is not secure.

288
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:02,280
Hey, you didn't have to say that!

289
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:04,574
What will we do about it?

290
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:07,953
Speak up.

291
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:12,624
Yes, it's the...

292
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:17,712
Tell them to hurry and build a new fort there!

293
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:29,099
Yes, we need a new fort on the Hirano side.

294
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,436
I, Saemonnosuke will build it!

295
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,275
You're saying anything pops into your head!

296
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:40,652
Got to make some damn thing up!

297
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:43,697
The enemy will attack...

298
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:48,577
Will attack, and then we'll
stop them in their tracks!

299
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,371
Good idea!

300
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:56,626
Saemonnosuke,
you have my permission to build it!

301
00:22:58,545 --> 00:22:59,963
Yes, my lord.

302
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,309
Once again you stumble on
with no logical plan.

303
00:23:12,517 --> 00:23:14,811
Don't think you'll succeed if you keep it up.

304
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:19,649
But if we stay in the fort,
nobody will know who we are.

305
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:23,278
Isn't that plan good enough?

306
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:27,616
We were followed.

307
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:29,534
Seems like.

308
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,374
Zenkuro.

309
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:40,420
Long time no see Saizo and Sasuke.

310
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:43,465
Second billing, you upside-down jerk?

311
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:45,508
Kugutsu village is our turf.

312
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:47,886
It's village rules that all must die.

313
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:49,596
Kill them!

314
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:22,170
Hotaru, is that you?
Missed you, baby!

315
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:24,464
Maybe I was a bit hasty.

316
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,929
I'll kill him with my bare hands!
No one shall touch him!

317
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:33,723
But we're old chums, aren't we?

318
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:35,767
Take it easy, Hotaru!

319
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:51,616
Cut it out, I don't want you to die.

320
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:57,288
No use sweet-talking me.
Now, prepare yourself!

321
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:08,174
All right!
That's enough.

322
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:15,974
CHIEF OF THE KUGUTSU GROUP, KUGUTSU SOSUKE

323
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:16,474
CHIEF OF THE KUGUTSU GROUP, KUGUTSU SOSUKE
But father, this man...

324
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:18,059
But father, this man...

325
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,353
I said enough!

326
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:34,492
Saizo, I hear you left our
village to become a bandit.

327
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:41,249
Now, you're helping Yukimura
to get a big fat reputation?

328
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:47,047
Where's your sense of shame?

329
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,965
You shouldn't say that...

330
00:25:48,965 --> 00:25:51,009
Zenkuro!
- Yes?

331
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:53,845
Don't try to follow him!

332
00:25:53,845 --> 00:25:56,473
But master, why?
- Stay away!

333
00:25:58,058 --> 00:25:59,476
Master!

334
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:02,312
Now, go!
- Sir!

335
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,990
Farewell...

336
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:18,161
Guess we won't see each other again.

337
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:27,670
It's clear the Toyotomi can't survive this war.

338
00:26:30,173 --> 00:26:33,593
Hey, why are you ignoring me master?

339
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,805
Can't you see I'm also a
big cheese from Kugutsu?

340
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:44,395
ONE MONTH LATER

341
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,414
I'd say the wall here should be higher.
- Yes.

342
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:06,835
Hey, it's becoming a reality!

343
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:09,254
Don't be so damn cheerful.

344
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:13,216
All right, take this to Otsu.

345
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:15,969
That's it over there?

346
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:18,138
Yes, it's all gunpowder.

347
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:19,681
Thank you.

348
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:25,728
Oh, Daisuke, that thing's heavy!

349
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:27,438
Don't worry.

350
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:32,068
We're finally ready.

351
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:34,821
The name of the fort?

352
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:35,446
Sanada Maru sound good?

353
00:27:35,446 --> 00:27:37,490
SANADA MARU
Sanada Maru sound good?

354
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:42,745
The battle at this fort, it's
going to be legendary, boss!

355
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:47,876
Sanada Maru...
A lot to live up to.

356
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:50,128
Idiots! Let me go!

357
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:53,298
It wasn't me!

358
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:57,886
Hey! Lay off!

359
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:00,096
What's his story?

360
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:04,350
Bitch was bragging he's lnaoka,
the brave Sanada soldier!

361
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,311
Using our name to hustle folks.

362
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:07,687
What?

363
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,355
Hey!

364
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:16,738
I didn't do anything so bad.

365
00:28:18,573 --> 00:28:23,286
If people think you're one of the
nine it makes you a big shot.

366
00:28:23,578 --> 00:28:25,830
What makes you so special?

367
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:27,582
Well, well.

368
00:28:30,168 --> 00:28:32,212
My family was samurai, too!

369
00:28:32,295 --> 00:28:36,424
We just lost our status and became farmers!

370
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:38,509
We had bad luck, that's all.

371
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:42,847
That's the only difference between me and you.

372
00:28:43,181 --> 00:28:45,934
Is that all?

373
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:51,689
Let's fight, then.

374
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:01,366
I'll show you!

375
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:12,293
You're gonna kill me?

376
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:15,672
Of course we will!
You've tarnished our reputation!

377
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:18,341
You think you can escape?

378
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:21,636
Say, that's some rusty sword.

379
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:48,329
One minute!

380
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:52,542
What now?

381
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:54,460
Hey buddy...

382
00:29:56,212 --> 00:30:01,301
How about we make you
brave soldier number 10?

383
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:04,095
What?

384
00:30:04,095 --> 00:30:06,097
Are you kidding?

385
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:09,726
Really?
We don't know who the hell he is!

386
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:12,770
Just like us.
We don't know who we are.

387
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:15,440
Oh, maybe?
- We're not like him at all.

388
00:30:15,523 --> 00:30:18,818
Right, we belong to the Sanada clan.

389
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:24,407
I think nine brave soldiers doesn't sound right.

390
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,992
Oh!

391
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,913
Makes sense.
Ten brave soldiers has a pleasant ring.

392
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:33,291
What does "pleasant ring" mean?

393
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:36,669
Fools! I'm against this idea!

394
00:30:37,295 --> 00:30:39,964
And you, Saizo?

395
00:30:42,175 --> 00:30:44,594
You're still too damn cheerful.

396
00:30:45,428 --> 00:30:47,388
Do whatever you like.

397
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:51,351
No way he's for this?

398
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:53,102
It's settled!

399
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,772
You're number 10!

400
00:30:57,565 --> 00:31:00,068
Don't I get a vote?

401
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:02,445
That's that!

402
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:13,915
From now on, we're the
Ten Brave Soldiers of Sanada!

403
00:31:19,462 --> 00:31:22,507
SANADA TEN BRAVES
(Sanada Juyushi)

404
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:34,852
<i>It's the year 1614...</i>

405
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:39,065
<i>On October 11, during Osaka Castle's fortification,</i>

406
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:42,026
<i>Tokugawa left his castle at Sunpu.</i>

407
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:46,406
<i>With a vigor that belied his advancing years,</i>

408
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:53,746
<i>he gathered forces to sweep away
the last challengers to oppose his will.</i>

409
00:31:55,873 --> 00:32:01,212
<i>The long Warring States era is finally ending.</i>

410
00:32:02,547 --> 00:32:08,803
<i>Nearly twice the number of defenders,
an army 200,000 strong surrounded Osaka Castle.</i>

411
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:13,808
<i>Osaka's great battle was about to begin.</i>

412
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:27,196
THE SIEGE OF OSAKA CASTLE
WINTER CAMPAIGN

413
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:29,031
Forward!

414
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:01,772
It begins!

415
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:08,029
At last!

416
00:33:09,322 --> 00:33:13,117
Everyone, take your positions!

417
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:16,787
Go!

418
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:19,123
Let's go!

419
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,875
Move!

420
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:22,627
Get ready!

421
00:33:41,521 --> 00:33:43,147
Line up!

422
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:53,199
That's Sanada's fort?

423
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:55,701
Gunners take aim!

424
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:58,621
Fire!

425
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:16,180
Are they hiding in there?

426
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,850
All right, keep firing!

427
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:22,603
We'll root them out of there!

428
00:34:23,354 --> 00:34:24,730
Attack!

429
00:34:56,804 --> 00:34:58,389
Fire!

430
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,688
Fire!

431
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:25,666
Go! Go!

432
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:34,133
Push!

433
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:15,132
Take that, fools!

434
00:36:27,395 --> 00:36:31,857
Keep after them!

435
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:33,442
Aim!

436
00:36:33,776 --> 00:36:35,277
Fire!

437
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:11,731
Daisuke! You all right?

438
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,820
Daisuke!

439
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:21,907
You all right?
- Thanks!

440
00:37:42,553 --> 00:37:44,013
Go!

441
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:06,786
Fire!

442
00:38:17,797 --> 00:38:19,381
Welcome boys!

443
00:38:38,901 --> 00:38:40,319
Shoot them!

444
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:41,779
Make aim!

445
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,925
My lord...

446
00:39:04,218 --> 00:39:07,346
It's all right.
Just do your best.

447
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:08,764
Yes!

448
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:16,272
This Sanada is one tough bastard.

449
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:20,192
Withdraw!

450
00:39:24,697 --> 00:39:26,991
Withdraw...

451
00:39:28,659 --> 00:39:31,871
Withdraw!

452
00:39:45,426 --> 00:39:47,928
The Sanada-maru defenders will be famous!

453
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:50,931
I'm so proud of myself!

454
00:39:52,391 --> 00:39:54,518
I'm a brave Sanada soldier.

455
00:39:56,896 --> 00:39:58,731
A brave drunkard.

456
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:02,484
Did you do anything out there?

457
00:40:03,152 --> 00:40:07,239
I must have killed 30 men.

458
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:11,160
Much easier than I thought it would be.

459
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:13,078
See? Look at that.

460
00:40:13,162 --> 00:40:15,831
Sir Daisuke, does it still hurt?

461
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:17,833
Not much.

462
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,002
Say young lord...

463
00:40:20,711 --> 00:40:23,088
How was your very first fight?

464
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:27,176
Tell the truth, were you scared to death?

465
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:30,971
You're lucky, boy!

466
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:35,142
With that out you won't have to fight tomorrow.

467
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:37,186
Leave him alone!

468
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:43,776
You spent today hiding under
that hut, shaking in your boots!

469
00:40:44,068 --> 00:40:46,612
Lying son of a bitch!

470
00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:49,406
Everybody knows, you fool!

471
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:54,411
It's not true.

472
00:40:54,995 --> 00:40:57,456
But samurai are too polite to say it out loud!

473
00:41:01,669 --> 00:41:04,004
You're all out to shame me!

474
00:41:15,766 --> 00:41:17,935
He's right about that.

475
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:20,437
Sir Daisuke?

476
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:25,693
With my injury, I won't have to fight now.

477
00:41:27,111 --> 00:41:29,488
Tell you the truth, I am relieved.

478
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,076
Everyone here is afraid, son.

479
00:41:34,827 --> 00:41:36,787
Sir Kamanosuke, too?

480
00:41:38,622 --> 00:41:42,251
Then what made you volunteer?

481
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,672
I don't know any other life.

482
00:41:47,798 --> 00:41:50,467
I was handed a spear when I was a boy.

483
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:54,054
All my life I've roamed from battle to battle.

484
00:41:54,847 --> 00:41:56,849
I just don't know any better.

485
00:41:57,057 --> 00:42:00,310
I tell myself this is the last time I'll fight,

486
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,813
but when war comes...

487
00:42:03,063 --> 00:42:05,733
there I go rushing into battle again.

488
00:42:26,336 --> 00:42:33,218
This will be the second time I've
come to your bedroom in secret.

489
00:42:34,136 --> 00:42:35,012
NINE MONTHS EARLIER IN KUDOYAMA

490
00:42:35,012 --> 00:42:38,057
NINE MONTHS EARLIER IN KUDOYAMA
Each time you came to me it was a surprise.

491
00:42:38,057 --> 00:42:40,350
Each time you came to me it was a surprise.

492
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:54,323
The first time, our Lord Hideyoshi
was ill when you visited the castle.

493
00:42:55,699 --> 00:43:05,501
That night my ladies-in-waiting
guided me silently to your room...

494
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:08,545
And I crept into your bed.

495
00:43:15,761 --> 00:43:21,725
You were so nervous, you refused me.

496
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:29,858
I swear I fell in love with you
the moment I laid eyes on you.

497
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:33,737
How handsome you were...

498
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:38,742
What a strong figure of a man...

499
00:43:42,788 --> 00:43:50,838
You were everything I could ever want in a lord.

500
00:43:57,261 --> 00:43:59,388
But what did you think of me?

501
00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:03,809
Did I please you?

502
00:44:05,269 --> 00:44:07,104
Tell me you care.

503
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:16,905
My lady...

504
00:44:19,158 --> 00:44:22,452
I'm not the man you think I am.

505
00:44:29,877 --> 00:44:32,129
So my dear...

506
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:39,011
You still won't tell me that you love me.

507
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,063
All right then!

508
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:59,448
Sir Sanada, show the whole nation the truth.

509
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:04,411
Show them that you are the
man I believed you were in Osaka!

510
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:08,040
Understand?

511
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:23,555
Twice I took my life into my
hands to come to your bed.

512
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:29,269
It's wrong to humiliate a woman!

513
00:45:36,276 --> 00:45:37,945
I know.

514
00:46:06,765 --> 00:46:09,226
Ieyasu's army is frustrated now.

515
00:46:09,268 --> 00:46:13,647
I'm sure they'll redouble their attack tomorrow.

516
00:46:13,814 --> 00:46:18,777
I know.
I guess it's time for a showdown.

517
00:46:20,153 --> 00:46:21,697
Who's there?

518
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:27,869
Miss Hotaru! How you doing?

519
00:46:27,953 --> 00:46:31,832
If you're looking to kill me again,
I'm not in the mood.

520
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:37,254
Why did you men leave our village?

521
00:46:38,005 --> 00:46:40,841
What a funny question!

522
00:46:42,092 --> 00:46:50,517
We got tired of the ninja path, that's all right?

523
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,811
Why do you ask?

524
00:46:54,771 --> 00:46:57,899
Why didn't you take me with you when you left?

525
00:47:02,279 --> 00:47:06,575
Saizo, I still feel the same.

526
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:09,286
I still love you.

527
00:47:10,495 --> 00:47:14,541
I wanted to kill you with my bare hands.

528
00:47:15,334 --> 00:47:21,548
Maybe my destiny is to be killed
one day by some stranger's hand.

529
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:28,680
But I'd rather be killed by you.

530
00:47:34,186 --> 00:47:35,354
Let's go.

531
00:47:35,437 --> 00:47:38,315
Are you sure, buddy?
This sounds real important!

532
00:47:38,357 --> 00:47:40,525
I'll tell you one thing...

533
00:47:41,693 --> 00:47:43,320
What's that?

534
00:47:47,783 --> 00:47:52,621
You know Osaka can't survive this war.

535
00:47:55,207 --> 00:47:57,000
Why do you say that?

536
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,045
Tell me why!

537
00:48:00,045 --> 00:48:02,464
I say it because it's true!
Everyone knows!

538
00:48:02,756 --> 00:48:04,549
Wow, what a cute girl!

539
00:48:04,633 --> 00:48:07,302
I'm saying it because I don't want you to die!

540
00:48:07,386 --> 00:48:08,887
That smarts.

541
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,058
No one can kill me.

542
00:48:16,228 --> 00:48:18,814
Unless you kill me.

543
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:25,320
Idiot.

544
00:48:46,925 --> 00:48:52,931
Today we will pulverize the Sanada fort.

545
00:48:53,265 --> 00:48:57,144
We will tear it down to the ground!

546
00:48:57,561 --> 00:48:58,895
Attack!

547
00:49:15,579 --> 00:49:20,250
<i>The Tokugawa vowed to
bring down Sanada Maru fort</i>

548
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:22,961
<i>once and for all with cannon.</i>

549
00:49:23,086 --> 00:49:24,546
Aim!

550
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:26,381
Fire!

551
00:50:35,659 --> 00:50:37,118
Hurry!
- To the left!

552
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,745
Attack!

553
00:51:54,946 --> 00:51:56,573
Amazing!

554
00:51:56,906 --> 00:51:59,909
Just the way father planned it!

555
00:52:01,578 --> 00:52:05,790
This day is ours!

556
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:07,917
Alley oop!

557
00:52:14,466 --> 00:52:16,426
Take that!

558
00:52:29,981 --> 00:52:34,069
Reporting!
It was an explosion at the 8th gate!

559
00:52:34,277 --> 00:52:35,278
What's that?

560
00:52:35,278 --> 00:52:38,948
The gate's been breached and the
enemy are reaching the inner castle!

561
00:52:53,171 --> 00:52:55,548
Ready! Fire!

562
00:52:59,052 --> 00:53:00,637
Fire!

563
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:50,520
My lord, our forces were repulsed at the 8th gate.

564
00:53:50,687 --> 00:53:53,314
Sanada's forces have broken our
lines and caused great bloodshed...

565
00:53:53,398 --> 00:53:59,320
<i>With Sanada's intervention, the Tokugawa
forces failed to enter the 8th gate.</i>

566
00:53:59,404 --> 00:54:04,868
<i>After a terrible loss of men
and arms, Lord Ieyasu was furious.</i>

567
00:54:05,076 --> 00:54:07,245
<i>He ordered a retreat.</i>

568
00:54:07,245 --> 00:54:12,500
Victory is in our grasp, the Tokugawa
forces are running from our lines!

569
00:54:13,835 --> 00:54:17,255
<i>The war, it seemed was ending at last.</i>

570
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:20,383
<i>The Osaka defenders prepared to celebrate.</i>

571
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:40,361
My supporters, my friends,
I thank you for your hard work.

572
00:54:43,531 --> 00:54:46,576
Guess he ran into our powerful defense,

573
00:54:46,576 --> 00:54:50,580
and leyasu knows he can't take our castle.

574
00:54:51,372 --> 00:54:54,167
He's asking for a peace settlement.

575
00:55:00,006 --> 00:55:01,549
Ask them what terms?

576
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:05,678
What are his conditions?

577
00:55:07,055 --> 00:55:10,099
First, to fill the moat in with dirt.

578
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,560
What?

579
00:55:15,271 --> 00:55:17,690
It's only a formality, I assume.

580
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:19,317
That's right.

581
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:25,240
We'll just break up the stone wall,
and fill the moat halfway.

582
00:55:25,323 --> 00:55:31,287
But, that won't work!
- If they find out, it will start up again!

583
00:55:31,371 --> 00:55:34,833
What if they attack again?
- We can't stop intruders without a moat!

584
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:38,044
This isn't a peace offer!
- That's right, it's a surrender!

585
00:55:38,211 --> 00:55:41,172
We'll be defenseless!
- We can't agree to it!

586
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:43,216
Have no fear!

587
00:55:49,138 --> 00:55:51,057
Our lady is not to blame!

588
00:55:51,266 --> 00:55:52,600
But sir?

589
00:55:52,684 --> 00:55:55,353
A cannonball landed next to
the room where she sleeps!

590
00:55:56,229 --> 00:56:00,900
I can't blame her for wanting this to end!

591
00:56:08,867 --> 00:56:11,160
It's not just a formality.

592
00:56:11,786 --> 00:56:14,706
Ieyasu will tear down our defenses.

593
00:56:16,374 --> 00:56:19,168
The castle will be naked to the world.

594
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:22,088
We'll never win this war.

595
00:56:23,464 --> 00:56:25,258
You have a minute?

596
00:56:40,189 --> 00:56:43,443
It's about that explosion at the 8th gate.

597
00:56:44,569 --> 00:56:49,616
Rumor has it someone dropped
a torch near the powder.

598
00:56:50,575 --> 00:56:54,913
Could somebody be working for the enemy?

599
00:56:56,164 --> 00:56:58,166
I'd say so.

600
00:57:01,252 --> 00:57:03,963
It had to be one of us.

601
00:57:04,172 --> 00:57:05,256
What?

602
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:09,552
Are you crazy!
None of us would do that.

603
00:57:09,677 --> 00:57:11,387
I want to believe you.

604
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:15,934
But Sasuke, when you fired that arrow,

605
00:57:15,934 --> 00:57:19,395
leyasu's men all rushed the
8th gate like they had a signal.

606
00:57:19,437 --> 00:57:22,023
Makes sense.
- Seriously?!

607
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:26,736
These brave soldiers may mean nothing
to you, but I believe in every one!

608
00:57:26,736 --> 00:57:28,279
But...
- Shut up!

609
00:57:28,613 --> 00:57:32,742
Keep this up and I'll shit on your head!

610
00:57:38,081 --> 00:57:39,707
Childish.

611
00:57:39,874 --> 00:57:42,043
Maybe I worry too much.

612
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:45,338
No, your instincts are always good.

613
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,300
Fools!

614
00:57:52,095 --> 00:57:53,638
Jinpachi?

615
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,189
Why did you make me the tenth brave?

616
00:58:04,607 --> 00:58:06,359
Why?

617
00:58:07,819 --> 00:58:10,113
I was having some fun.

618
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:22,375
Tell me.

619
00:58:28,339 --> 00:58:32,218
Why was it so much fun?

620
00:58:34,929 --> 00:58:41,978
If you tell a lie, and you're
sure it's a lie that's one thing.

621
00:58:42,854 --> 00:58:47,108
But if you keep lying long
enough, it becomes the truth.

622
00:58:47,442 --> 00:58:49,235
Don't you think that's funny?

623
00:58:55,033 --> 00:59:00,163
Why not tell the biggest lie to the world?

624
00:59:01,706 --> 00:59:03,791
Then we'll have more fun.

625
00:59:11,507 --> 00:59:13,551
Maybe you're right.

626
00:59:15,178 --> 00:59:17,013
No, he isn't.

627
00:59:20,266 --> 00:59:25,521
We let you join because
you could be Hideyori's double.

628
00:59:27,148 --> 00:59:29,525
If the battle turns bad, we'll pass you off as him.

629
00:59:29,609 --> 00:59:33,237
Saizo!
- If you don't like it, just take a walk!

630
00:59:48,836 --> 00:59:51,089
Please, Jinpachi!

631
00:59:53,925 --> 00:59:55,885
Now that was rude...

632
00:59:57,386 --> 01:00:00,389
Hey, why did you hit me?

633
01:00:01,432 --> 01:00:03,976
You think you're boss of the Sanada clan?

634
01:00:05,561 --> 01:00:08,481
You want to create your own Yukimura...

635
01:00:08,981 --> 01:00:12,235
And sell him to the whole world?!

636
01:00:15,238 --> 01:00:16,906
That's right.

637
01:00:18,908 --> 01:00:20,743
Aren't you having fun?

638
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:25,873
No I'm not!

639
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:31,170
This isn't a joke anymore, Sasuke.

640
01:00:33,798 --> 01:00:35,550
And I've had enough!

641
01:00:36,092 --> 01:00:37,593
What about you?

642
01:00:37,593 --> 01:00:42,098
Didn't you leave home to find adventure?!

643
01:00:42,181 --> 01:00:43,766
Isn't that so?!

644
01:00:48,271 --> 01:00:49,814
No.

645
01:00:49,939 --> 01:00:51,566
What?

646
01:00:52,942 --> 01:00:55,236
I'm not like you.

647
01:00:56,487 --> 01:00:59,949
You're lying!
We're alike, you and I!

648
01:01:00,032 --> 01:01:01,450
We're not!

649
01:01:11,586 --> 01:01:14,755
<i>The year 1614, December 22...</i>

650
01:01:14,839 --> 01:01:19,969
<i>The peace negotiations
ended the siege of Osaka Castle.</i>

651
01:01:20,636 --> 01:01:28,895
<i>The castle's defensive moat and
perimeter were removed by 1615.</i>

652
01:01:48,623 --> 01:01:54,879
And if war breaks out again, we're through.

653
01:01:57,465 --> 01:01:59,508
We can't win.

654
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:08,851
Dear, what makes you say that?

655
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,984
If it comes...

656
01:02:18,986 --> 01:02:25,618
I, Hideyori, will commit seppuku.

657
01:02:28,371 --> 01:02:30,498
Please don't worry.

658
01:02:48,266 --> 01:02:49,976
Some kind of letter?

659
01:02:50,142 --> 01:02:54,605
Proof that you people never had a chance.

660
01:03:10,413 --> 01:03:11,497
This is...

661
01:03:11,497 --> 01:03:16,419
If you understand, get out of Osaka fast,

662
01:03:16,419 --> 01:03:18,754
and never come back.

663
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:29,849
Have a good night.

664
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:37,064
Intruder!

665
01:03:37,815 --> 01:03:40,693
Hi there, I'm Lord Yukimura's messenger.

666
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:43,029
Saemonnosuke sent you?

667
01:03:43,112 --> 01:03:46,198
Yes, he sent me with a message.

668
01:03:46,407 --> 01:03:52,079
I said write a note, but he was
afraid someone might see the thing.

669
01:03:53,622 --> 01:03:56,667
Tell me.
What does he say?

670
01:04:01,088 --> 01:04:03,924
Oh my...

671
01:04:07,428 --> 01:04:09,388
How can I convey this?

672
01:04:09,388 --> 01:04:11,932
Simple. Just speak up!

673
01:04:15,686 --> 01:04:20,733
I've loved you for so long,
since my eyes first beheld you.

674
01:04:24,153 --> 01:04:27,365
In the moonlight long ago...

675
01:04:28,657 --> 01:04:31,827
Well, a lot of stuff like that.

676
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:37,333
Does it matter how he said it?

677
01:04:43,214 --> 01:04:44,757
It's true?

678
01:04:45,383 --> 01:04:46,717
Yes.

679
01:04:53,349 --> 01:04:55,309
At last...

680
01:04:58,479 --> 01:05:00,481
He admits it.

681
01:05:09,198 --> 01:05:13,035
Oh, now you're crying!

682
01:05:13,077 --> 01:05:16,539
That's why I didn't want to speak.

683
01:05:17,748 --> 01:05:23,421
Any messages for Sir Sanada?
I'll take your message.

684
01:05:26,924 --> 01:05:36,600
When you see him, please tell
him I don't deserve his love.

685
01:05:37,935 --> 01:05:39,687
It honors me too much.

686
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:44,108
Why did you say that?

687
01:05:44,233 --> 01:05:47,695
This is getting complicated!

688
01:05:47,945 --> 01:05:53,075
I can only tell you how I truly feel inside.

689
01:06:00,416 --> 01:06:03,961
That's fine, but can I tell him that?

690
01:06:07,882 --> 01:06:13,262
I'll tell him you were so happy that you cried.

691
01:06:20,478 --> 01:06:22,146
That's true.

692
01:06:24,064 --> 01:06:25,608
I am pleased.

693
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:57,515
<i>Within 3 months, in May of 1615, Ieyasu raised
another army to challenge Osaka Castle.</i>

694
01:06:57,848 --> 01:07:05,356
<i>The very presence of Osaka's troops and
vassals at the castle was held to be proof enough</i>

695
01:07:05,356 --> 01:07:11,820
<i>that Osaka planned to rebel
against the Tokugawa government.</i>

696
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:17,159
<i>leyasu swore he'd crush
the defenders in a final battle,</i>

697
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:19,912
<i>and marched to Osaka with 180,000 troops.</i>

698
01:07:19,995 --> 01:07:26,252
He knows we never planned a rebellion!
Won't Ieyasu negotiate with us again?

699
01:07:26,418 --> 01:07:27,836
Don't!

700
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:31,215
Ieyasu was a vassal of Toyotomi clan!

701
01:07:31,382 --> 01:07:33,467
How can we dignify these charges?

702
01:07:33,551 --> 01:07:35,010
That's right, it's true!

703
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:38,305
Let's kill him for betraying us at Sekigahara!

704
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:43,352
But now that our defenses are down
it's hopeless!

705
01:07:43,727 --> 01:07:46,605
If they attack us now, what can we do?

706
01:07:48,357 --> 01:07:49,900
That's enough!

707
01:07:50,943 --> 01:07:52,736
We have no options.

708
01:07:53,654 --> 01:07:59,660
We must stand up and make our
lord proud of us one more time!

709
01:08:00,327 --> 01:08:01,870
Lady Yodo!

710
01:08:09,753 --> 01:08:11,297
Yes!

711
01:08:12,381 --> 01:08:14,258
Now...

712
01:08:15,467 --> 01:08:19,096
There's only one path ahead of us!

713
01:08:20,973 --> 01:08:25,311
<i>So, on May 6th at Domyoji in Kawachi,</i>

714
01:08:25,311 --> 01:08:30,232
<i>the Toyotomi and the Tokugawa
clans began their final struggle,</i>

715
01:08:30,232 --> 01:08:33,235
<i>The Siege of Osaka Castle, Summer Campaign.</i>

716
01:08:36,947 --> 01:08:40,409
THE SIEGE OF OSAKA CASTLE
SUMMER CAMPAIGN

717
01:09:44,056 --> 01:09:47,101
Goto Matabei is dead!

718
01:09:57,903 --> 01:09:58,237
Let me through!

719
01:09:58,237 --> 01:09:59,655
CHAUSUYAMA: SANADA TROUP HEADQUARTERS
Let me through!

720
01:09:59,655 --> 01:10:00,406
CHAUSUYAMA: SANADA TROUP HEADQUARTERS

721
01:10:03,951 --> 01:10:05,160
Reporting!

722
01:10:05,327 --> 01:10:10,582
Sir Goto Matabei was killed in the battle at Domyoji!

723
01:11:15,105 --> 01:11:16,940
Sasuke...

724
01:11:17,816 --> 01:11:23,197
This war isn't going to end well.

725
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:28,994
I think all we know that.

726
01:11:47,763 --> 01:11:50,390
Tomorrow is our last battle.

727
01:11:51,517 --> 01:11:55,479
Tonight is our last chance to drink saké together.

728
01:11:56,104 --> 01:11:58,148
I'm going to miss you guys.

729
01:11:58,357 --> 01:11:59,608
What?

730
01:11:59,608 --> 01:12:03,654
Let's try to survive tomorrow,
and drink saké again.

731
01:12:03,779 --> 01:12:05,280
Am I right, boss?

732
01:12:05,364 --> 01:12:08,408
And if we die together, we'll
share sake' in the next world.

733
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:10,577
You got that right!

734
01:12:12,955 --> 01:12:16,500
But Sir Kamanosuke is calm as usual.

735
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:20,963
Nothing ever seems to bother him.
Why's that?

736
01:12:21,588 --> 01:12:26,009
Since I was a boy I've faced
the dangers now before us.

737
01:12:26,176 --> 01:12:28,387
This is just another day.

738
01:12:28,887 --> 01:12:30,430
Is that so?

739
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:36,061
If reincarnation were true, I'd
pray to live in a world without war.

740
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:41,733
Then I'd have a beautiful
wife and some happy children.

741
01:12:42,442 --> 01:12:46,321
That's the dream of my life.

742
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:48,949
Putting us on?

743
01:12:50,117 --> 01:12:52,202
You're damn right.

744
01:12:55,455 --> 01:12:57,833
If I were born again,

745
01:12:57,833 --> 01:13:02,504
I'd leave this country go to
China and be a big fat success!

746
01:13:02,796 --> 01:13:06,550
I'd trade with foreigners
and become a rich merchant!

747
01:13:06,675 --> 01:13:07,759
And?

748
01:13:07,885 --> 01:13:10,846
With the money I made...
- Lend us!

749
01:13:11,054 --> 01:13:13,974
I would want to help out our lord.

750
01:13:14,141 --> 01:13:16,643
Hey, you're helping him now!

751
01:13:16,643 --> 01:13:19,354
You guys are too much!
Let's drink up!

752
01:13:20,689 --> 01:13:22,858
Drink!

753
01:13:25,068 --> 01:13:27,070
What are you thinking?

754
01:13:31,575 --> 01:13:34,202
Lord Yukimura's on my mind...

755
01:13:34,703 --> 01:13:40,125
I'd like to help him win again, one last time.

756
01:14:07,152 --> 01:14:10,530
My lord, is Daisuke with you?

757
01:14:12,449 --> 01:14:16,453
He needs to be alone for a while.

758
01:14:17,412 --> 01:14:19,623
Is something wrong?

759
01:14:24,252 --> 01:14:26,088
We talked...

760
01:14:27,089 --> 01:14:29,508
I told him everything.

761
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,261
Wait...

762
01:14:33,637 --> 01:14:35,514
You told him everything?

763
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:45,399
I had to tell him his father's not the man he seems...

764
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:54,449
And that Sasuke and Saizo
have planned the Osaka strategy.

765
01:14:56,868 --> 01:14:58,412
What's that?

766
01:14:58,787 --> 01:15:00,622
What's this about?

767
01:15:00,789 --> 01:15:05,335
Forgive me friends for not telling you.

768
01:15:10,132 --> 01:15:12,009
Why do this?

769
01:15:17,097 --> 01:15:19,016
Father...

770
01:15:19,016 --> 01:15:27,065
I don't know why you said such ugly things,

771
01:15:27,065 --> 01:15:31,570
the night before we face our final battle.

772
01:15:36,033 --> 01:15:44,666
I'm ashamed to be the son of this imposter.

773
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:47,627
Enough of that talk!
- Don't, Sasuke!

774
01:15:47,753 --> 01:15:50,088
But my lord!
- It's not important!

775
01:15:52,716 --> 01:15:54,551
Daisuke...

776
01:15:56,678 --> 01:15:58,513
Everyone, listen to me.

777
01:16:02,434 --> 01:16:11,777
I want to be myself tomorrow...

778
01:16:13,403 --> 01:16:20,035
Be what Sasuke's been pretending I am.

779
01:16:25,207 --> 01:16:27,626
Tomorrow...

780
01:16:30,545 --> 01:16:34,382
Ieyasu will face his real enemy!

781
01:16:49,272 --> 01:16:51,358
Ieyasu's camp will be here.

782
01:16:51,566 --> 01:16:54,402
Matsudaira clan will form
lines there to protect him.

783
01:16:54,528 --> 01:17:01,660
30 minutes later our Mori clan
will strike their lines from the side.

784
01:17:02,119 --> 01:17:06,081
I'm certain Ieyasu's group will be in turmoil.

785
01:17:06,581 --> 01:17:14,464
Our Sanada army will take advantage of the
confusion and hit the Tokugawa camp directly!

786
01:17:17,384 --> 01:17:22,264
The Mori group have already agreed to this.

787
01:17:25,851 --> 01:17:30,272
So, you like my plan?

788
01:17:33,984 --> 01:17:35,902
Great...

789
01:17:37,821 --> 01:17:39,865
Great, Lord Yukimura!

790
01:17:40,407 --> 01:17:41,616
You think so?

791
01:17:41,616 --> 01:17:46,288
It's a rushed strategy,
but we just might win this thing.

792
01:17:46,705 --> 01:17:48,456
I see.

793
01:17:52,794 --> 01:17:54,588
Daisuke...

794
01:17:55,630 --> 01:17:58,550
Be prepared to follow me in.

795
01:17:58,967 --> 01:18:06,308
If I can tie down the troops
protecting leyasu, kill him!

796
01:18:10,604 --> 01:18:13,148
Yes, father.

797
01:18:18,069 --> 01:18:24,618
Ieyasu is our target...

798
01:18:26,244 --> 01:18:28,538
And we must be ready...

799
01:18:30,498 --> 01:18:33,919
Ready to crush him!

800
01:18:34,127 --> 01:18:35,587
Yes!

801
01:18:38,173 --> 01:18:39,841
I'm sorry!

802
01:18:39,841 --> 01:18:42,928
Father, I didn't understand your feelings at all!

803
01:18:43,303 --> 01:18:45,013
Please forgive me!

804
01:18:52,229 --> 01:18:54,231
It's all right, Daisuke.

805
01:19:15,502 --> 01:19:19,547
What's wrong Sasuke?
Why the tears?

806
01:19:22,759 --> 01:19:24,552
I'm just happy.

807
01:19:25,762 --> 01:19:30,725
Damn it!
You really could pull this off!

808
01:19:34,062 --> 01:19:35,772
Idiot.

809
01:20:24,696 --> 01:20:27,157
Sanada's strategy?

810
01:20:29,409 --> 01:20:33,913
He's got something up his sleeve for sure...

811
01:20:34,456 --> 01:20:36,458
But I won't tell you.

812
01:20:36,666 --> 01:20:38,126
What?

813
01:20:40,378 --> 01:20:44,215
Sorry, but I'm starting to like the guy.

814
01:20:45,675 --> 01:20:47,927
Here's your money.

815
01:20:59,773 --> 01:21:02,734
I'm through doing business with you.

816
01:21:03,401 --> 01:21:05,779
Guess I don't get off that easy?

817
01:21:06,154 --> 01:21:09,074
Because we're friends,
I'll wait until you're finished.

818
01:21:09,616 --> 01:21:11,159
Nice of you.

819
01:21:19,209 --> 01:21:20,668
Stop that!

820
01:21:27,217 --> 01:21:29,886
How about that?

821
01:21:35,683 --> 01:21:37,310
One minute!

822
01:21:45,402 --> 01:21:47,529
Zenkuro, take a walk!

823
01:21:53,201 --> 01:21:55,370
Be sure to clean up...

824
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:09,092
It was the money, that's my weakness.

825
01:22:09,509 --> 01:22:12,345
Did you start the fire near the 8th gate?

826
01:22:12,595 --> 01:22:13,930
I did.

827
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:43,668
Don't hesitate!

828
01:22:49,090 --> 01:22:51,217
You've got guts.

829
01:23:13,281 --> 01:23:14,949
What's so funny?

830
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:23,374
Just thinking about lying
my way to the truth again.

831
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:32,258
Let's suppose Kakei Juzo's deal
with the enemy was a big hoax?

832
01:23:32,717 --> 01:23:34,427
What do you think?

833
01:23:36,721 --> 01:23:38,348
Like it?

834
01:23:39,265 --> 01:23:40,975
Like it?

835
01:23:43,561 --> 01:23:45,772
But he's a traitor!
We should take his head!

836
01:23:45,772 --> 01:23:47,190
All right!

837
01:23:48,233 --> 01:23:51,277
You're our fine brave friend.

838
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:55,698
Is that right, Juzo?

839
01:24:13,007 --> 01:24:14,842
Well...

840
01:24:16,803 --> 01:24:19,347
Nine has a pleasant ring.

841
01:24:25,019 --> 01:24:26,771
He said it!

842
01:24:34,571 --> 01:24:36,573
What's "pleasant ring?"

843
01:24:52,797 --> 01:24:59,512
<i>The morning of the 7th, the Toyotomi
army assembled 70,000 troops.</i>

844
01:25:00,096 --> 01:25:02,056
<i>On the other side,</i>

845
01:25:02,056 --> 01:25:06,686
<i>the Tokugawa were approaching
Osaka with an army of 160,000.</i>

846
01:25:06,853 --> 01:25:11,107
<i>The time had come for the final battle.</i>

847
01:25:46,017 --> 01:25:48,853
Ieyasu himself is our target!

848
01:25:49,062 --> 01:25:51,606
We have no time for petty skirmishes,

849
01:25:51,606 --> 01:25:57,362
we're marching right down leyasu's throat!

850
01:25:57,570 --> 01:25:59,906
Yes!

851
01:26:01,866 --> 01:26:04,077
Forward!

852
01:26:12,377 --> 01:26:14,170
Go!

853
01:26:24,472 --> 01:26:26,057
Fire!

854
01:26:27,141 --> 01:26:29,102
Fire!

855
01:26:30,478 --> 01:26:32,230
Fire!

856
01:26:37,527 --> 01:26:39,821
Let's go!

857
01:26:42,115 --> 01:26:43,991
Come on!

858
01:26:45,827 --> 01:26:48,996
Forward!
- Onwards!

859
01:26:49,622 --> 01:26:51,749
Attack!

860
01:26:56,796 --> 01:26:58,423
Aim carefully!

861
01:26:58,548 --> 01:27:00,299
Don't miss!

862
01:27:08,725 --> 01:27:10,143
Fire!

863
01:27:55,772 --> 01:27:57,857
Where are you?

864
01:27:57,899 --> 01:28:00,651
Don't worry about us!

865
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,837
Unno!

866
01:28:20,338 --> 01:28:22,548
Forgive me lord!

867
01:28:22,715 --> 01:28:25,885
I have miscalculated my attack.

868
01:28:26,803 --> 01:28:31,557
You'll have to kill the rest!

869
01:28:33,726 --> 01:28:37,855
Thank you for your devoted service!

870
01:28:39,607 --> 01:28:41,609
May your soul rest peacefully!

871
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:43,986
My lord!

872
01:29:06,759 --> 01:29:08,302
Unno!

873
01:29:13,850 --> 01:29:17,687
UNNO ROKURO DIES

874
01:29:21,232 --> 01:29:24,861
Now, attack!

875
01:29:45,798 --> 01:29:49,927
My lord, Sir Mori's started the flanking strike!

876
01:29:50,678 --> 01:29:53,514
I see Ieyasu's camp!

877
01:29:54,807 --> 01:29:56,475
Here we go!

878
01:29:56,601 --> 01:29:59,228
If you're still alive, follow me!

879
01:30:07,445 --> 01:30:10,281
My lord, Mori group's attacking our flank!

880
01:30:10,698 --> 01:30:12,241
Fools!

881
01:30:12,617 --> 01:30:15,828
What are they playing at?

882
01:30:17,496 --> 01:30:19,582
Get more men and push them back!

883
01:30:19,749 --> 01:30:21,000
Yes, my lord!

884
01:30:22,585 --> 01:30:25,880
I am Sanada Saemonnosuke Yukimura!

885
01:30:26,255 --> 01:30:30,134
Ieyasu, I'm here to take your head!

886
01:30:30,217 --> 01:30:33,054
Ieyasu! Prepare!

887
01:30:35,014 --> 01:30:36,849
Filthy brat!

888
01:30:46,442 --> 01:30:48,569
Sir Daisuke!

889
01:30:50,112 --> 01:30:51,572
Mochizuki!

890
01:30:57,995 --> 01:31:01,123
Sir Daisuke, hurry after leyasu!

891
01:31:09,632 --> 01:31:12,259
Hurry!
- I will!

892
01:31:20,977 --> 01:31:23,396
On to victory!

893
01:31:29,485 --> 01:31:33,531
MOCHIZUKI ROKURO DIES

894
01:31:47,253 --> 01:31:51,132
Jinpachi!
- Jinpachi, get up!

895
01:32:04,311 --> 01:32:05,813
Go!

896
01:32:40,931 --> 01:32:42,475
Kamanosuke!

897
01:32:54,862 --> 01:32:59,825
It's ending!
I die without regrets!

898
01:32:59,950 --> 01:33:03,537
I've had a damn good time!

899
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:08,000
I'm leaving.

900
01:33:08,084 --> 01:33:09,919
Shall we try again?

901
01:33:11,587 --> 01:33:13,089
I'm going!

902
01:33:13,172 --> 01:33:16,258
Yes, my lord! Let's go!

903
01:33:17,134 --> 01:33:18,969
Forward!

904
01:33:35,236 --> 01:33:36,779
Kamanosuke?

905
01:33:41,492 --> 01:33:44,537
YURI KAMANOSUKE DIES

906
01:33:58,634 --> 01:34:03,681
Shit! You again?

907
01:34:04,849 --> 01:34:06,475
Die!

908
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:28,956
KAKEI JUZO DIES

909
01:35:21,842 --> 01:35:25,804
Saizo, I'm going to kill you today!

910
01:36:25,614 --> 01:36:27,157
Hurry!

911
01:36:27,866 --> 01:36:32,454
You can do it!
- You can break through!

912
01:36:35,958 --> 01:36:37,960
Go on, Lord Yukimura!

913
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:05,988
Goddamn!

914
01:37:13,454 --> 01:37:15,748
That hurts, fool!

915
01:37:38,729 --> 01:37:42,566
Ieyasu! Where are you?

916
01:37:44,943 --> 01:37:48,364
Ready! Release!

917
01:38:07,174 --> 01:38:10,094
Be careful!
We'll still beat you!

918
01:38:31,949 --> 01:38:34,952
Ieyasu! Draw your sword!

919
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:36,537
My lord!
- Don't!

920
01:39:26,295 --> 01:39:28,338
Let's go Daisuke!
- Yes!

921
01:39:28,505 --> 01:39:33,427
Come along!
leyasu, show yourself!

922
01:39:51,695 --> 01:39:53,530
Fire!

923
01:39:53,739 --> 01:39:55,199
Daisuke!

924
01:40:36,657 --> 01:40:38,116
Father!

925
01:40:39,243 --> 01:40:43,288
Forget about me!
Now, go!

926
01:40:43,372 --> 01:40:44,831
Damn you!

927
01:40:52,339 --> 01:40:53,840
Fire!

928
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:26,665
Daisuke!

929
01:41:43,223 --> 01:41:44,683
Daisuke!

930
01:41:46,435 --> 01:41:48,020
Daisuke!

931
01:41:49,271 --> 01:41:51,273
Father...

932
01:41:52,899 --> 01:41:55,360
I'm glad we tried...

933
01:41:59,239 --> 01:42:02,659
We've come so far together.

934
01:42:20,802 --> 01:42:25,557
SANADA DAISUKE DIES

935
01:42:26,141 --> 01:42:31,480
Daisuke!

936
01:42:32,564 --> 01:42:35,609
Daisuke!

937
01:43:03,595 --> 01:43:05,889
Attack!

938
01:43:34,167 --> 01:43:35,836
Lord Yukimura!

939
01:43:36,086 --> 01:43:37,629
Daisuke!

940
01:43:39,506 --> 01:43:41,717
Look at him!
- Wait!

941
01:43:44,261 --> 01:43:46,054
This is it.

942
01:43:46,888 --> 01:43:49,182
Sasuke...

943
01:43:50,809 --> 01:43:52,686
It's over...

944
01:43:53,729 --> 01:43:56,606
I knew I'd never be a real man.

945
01:44:00,068 --> 01:44:02,112
How can you say that?

946
01:44:03,488 --> 01:44:06,658
You're a great man and a hero!

947
01:44:09,995 --> 01:44:11,872
Sasuke...

948
01:44:15,751 --> 01:44:18,003
We had some fun...

949
01:44:24,176 --> 01:44:26,011
My lord!

950
01:44:33,685 --> 01:44:35,729
Sasuke...

951
01:44:38,356 --> 01:44:45,447
Lord Hideyori, and Lady Yodo, take care of them.

952
01:44:50,076 --> 01:44:52,245
Take care of yourself.

953
01:45:19,940 --> 01:45:21,775
My lord!

954
01:45:25,278 --> 01:45:29,241
Lord Yukimura!

955
01:45:50,011 --> 01:45:52,472
Sanada Yukimura...

956
01:45:54,891 --> 01:45:57,853
Now that was a real man.

957
01:46:08,738 --> 01:46:13,535
<i>When Sanada Yukimura finally died,</i>

958
01:46:13,535 --> 01:46:16,997
<i>the Toyotomi clan was completely defenseless.</i>

959
01:46:32,470 --> 01:46:34,764
Fall back!

960
01:47:12,886 --> 01:47:15,055
Wait! I'm not here to fight with you!

961
01:47:15,096 --> 01:47:17,807
What do you want?
- Now wait!

962
01:47:18,224 --> 01:47:20,393
Saizo gave me a message for you!

963
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:22,979
If you kill me, you'll never get it!

964
01:47:25,231 --> 01:47:27,025
So what's the message?

965
01:47:36,076 --> 01:47:37,577
Hey, wait!

966
01:48:19,327 --> 01:48:22,122
Has Hideyori been sighted yet?!

967
01:48:42,475 --> 01:48:43,893
It's me.

968
01:48:49,274 --> 01:48:50,859
What's the password?

969
01:48:50,984 --> 01:48:53,236
Sasuke is the most handsome man!

970
01:48:53,319 --> 01:48:54,654
It's an enemy.
- It's an enemy!

971
01:48:54,696 --> 01:48:56,865
Cut it out, you moron!

972
01:49:02,704 --> 01:49:05,790
Hey, what gives with the password stuff?

973
01:49:05,957 --> 01:49:08,626
Forget it.
Where's Lord Hideyori and Lady Okata?

974
01:49:08,793 --> 01:49:11,504
I brought them here.
Come this way, it's safe.

975
01:49:16,509 --> 01:49:19,345
Where are we?
- Storage cellar.

976
01:49:19,429 --> 01:49:21,723
Mostly full of explosives now.

977
01:49:21,848 --> 01:49:24,934
Say, where did Jinpachi get to?

978
01:49:25,185 --> 01:49:28,021
Don't know, maybe he escaped.

979
01:49:28,354 --> 01:49:34,069
Anyway, I'd like to know how we
sneak these two out of the castle?

980
01:49:34,194 --> 01:49:39,115
We'll hide 'em in a chest, dress like
Tokugawa men and walk out the door.

981
01:49:39,407 --> 01:49:40,658
Hey!

982
01:49:41,576 --> 01:49:43,036
Wait!

983
01:49:46,790 --> 01:49:49,542
I have to speak to this woman.

984
01:49:50,710 --> 01:49:52,170
What's that?

985
01:49:52,712 --> 01:49:55,965
I can never forgive this woman.

986
01:49:57,050 --> 01:50:03,056
Ieyasu has been giving her orders.

987
01:50:27,664 --> 01:50:29,499
Hey, can you read?
- Not me!

988
01:50:29,582 --> 01:50:31,626
What could be worse?

989
01:50:32,085 --> 01:50:33,670
What's this about?

990
01:50:33,795 --> 01:50:37,841
Ieyasu has been secretly writing to your mother.

991
01:50:39,008 --> 01:50:40,260
What?

992
01:50:45,515 --> 01:50:48,101
Pardon me, my lady.

993
01:50:48,685 --> 01:50:50,311
What is it?

994
01:50:52,772 --> 01:50:56,526
A secret letter for you, from our lord.

995
01:50:57,485 --> 01:50:59,070
What?

996
01:51:11,082 --> 01:51:15,670
Ieyasu wanted to bring all clans
allied to Toyotomi to one place.

997
01:51:16,337 --> 01:51:19,048
There he could kill them all.

998
01:51:20,550 --> 01:51:25,889
Your mother helped him accomplish the slaughter.

999
01:51:27,682 --> 01:51:31,436
That damnable bitch!

1000
01:51:31,811 --> 01:51:36,733
After Sir Yukimura, she asked the most
powerful samurai to defend this place.

1001
01:51:36,816 --> 01:51:40,945
Once they were all in one place,
she plotted with him to destroy them!

1002
01:51:41,070 --> 01:51:42,864
Have no fear!

1003
01:51:43,990 --> 01:51:46,993
It's horrible!
I can't believe it!

1004
01:51:47,535 --> 01:51:49,370
How could you do this?

1005
01:51:49,537 --> 01:51:51,623
She did it all for you.

1006
01:51:56,419 --> 01:51:57,962
Mother!

1007
01:52:01,424 --> 01:52:03,176
It's true.

1008
01:52:04,469 --> 01:52:06,846
This evil man promised one thing...

1009
01:52:07,013 --> 01:52:10,767
Hideyori could live if I helped
him accomplish his plan.

1010
01:52:10,975 --> 01:52:14,354
So I wrote back to him and I agreed.

1011
01:52:14,437 --> 01:52:16,689
You were insane to trust that man!

1012
01:52:16,689 --> 01:52:18,775
I would accept any loss.

1013
01:52:19,317 --> 01:52:21,611
If I could save your life...

1014
01:52:21,694 --> 01:52:26,115
I didn't care how many people had to die!

1015
01:52:26,532 --> 01:52:30,578
I'd walk willingly into Hell for you.

1016
01:52:31,746 --> 01:52:34,791
Any mother would do the same!

1017
01:52:47,053 --> 01:52:52,558
So, what are you going to do with her?

1018
01:52:53,685 --> 01:52:55,436
Do?

1019
01:52:57,689 --> 01:52:59,565
I want her to die.

1020
01:53:00,275 --> 01:53:01,943
We're with you!

1021
01:53:02,902 --> 01:53:05,363
Only then will I have peace.

1022
01:53:07,573 --> 01:53:09,826
I'm not going to let you!

1023
01:53:12,620 --> 01:53:15,581
Because Lord Yukimura loved this woman.

1024
01:53:16,082 --> 01:53:18,042
Not my problem.

1025
01:53:20,086 --> 01:53:21,921
Stop right there!

1026
01:53:36,519 --> 01:53:39,814
Since you know my secret...

1027
01:53:40,857 --> 01:53:43,735
Everyone here must die.

1028
01:53:56,789 --> 01:54:00,418
The lord is here!
Let's kill them.

1029
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:03,546
About time.

1030
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:06,215
Go!

1031
01:54:27,278 --> 01:54:28,821
Who's that?

1032
01:54:35,495 --> 01:54:38,289
I won't let Saizo get hurt.

1033
01:54:39,165 --> 01:54:40,750
Hotaru!

1034
01:54:41,918 --> 01:54:44,504
Saizo, let's kill them.

1035
01:54:44,712 --> 01:54:46,255
Thank you.

1036
01:54:59,060 --> 01:55:00,603
Ready?

1037
01:55:09,695 --> 01:55:11,948
If it's what you want.

1038
01:55:24,919 --> 01:55:26,421
Wait!

1039
01:55:30,091 --> 01:55:34,846
I'm ready for whatever death you choose.

1040
01:55:35,430 --> 01:55:36,973
No, Lord Hideyori! Please!

1041
01:55:37,056 --> 01:55:40,059
But please spare my mother!

1042
01:55:40,184 --> 01:55:43,938
Hideyori!
- It doesn't matter, it's too late!

1043
01:58:04,787 --> 01:58:06,372
Saizo!

1044
01:58:15,256 --> 01:58:18,467
They saved me some trouble.

1045
01:58:18,718 --> 01:58:21,762
Hotaru, finish it!

1046
01:58:33,190 --> 01:58:37,612
Hotaru and Saizo will die together.

1047
01:58:38,654 --> 01:58:43,868
You love Saizo that much?

1048
01:58:43,951 --> 01:58:48,623
If I hurry we'll die together, he and I.

1049
01:58:49,248 --> 01:58:52,001
What madness is she dreaming?

1050
01:58:58,758 --> 01:59:04,722
Sadly, my daughter fell in love with the man.

1051
01:59:06,015 --> 01:59:12,563
She wants to give up her life to join him.

1052
01:59:16,817 --> 01:59:19,445
Please show some sympathy.

1053
01:59:20,029 --> 01:59:22,365
Let her die in peace.

1054
01:59:25,660 --> 01:59:27,953
This whole cellar will blow up soon.

1055
01:59:28,245 --> 01:59:30,414
We'd better go.

1056
01:59:33,376 --> 01:59:34,877
Withdraw!

1057
01:59:43,010 --> 01:59:44,595
Father.

1058
01:59:47,390 --> 01:59:49,225
You're a fool.

1059
02:00:07,493 --> 02:00:09,453
Saizo?

1060
02:00:22,299 --> 02:00:24,468
Saizo!

1061
02:00:48,909 --> 02:00:51,203
Wow!

1062
02:00:53,456 --> 02:00:55,332
That was great!

1063
02:00:56,250 --> 02:01:00,838
Hey, Jinpachi!
You were amazing!

1064
02:01:01,547 --> 02:01:02,965
That was easy!

1065
02:01:03,048 --> 02:01:05,217
How about us?

1066
02:01:05,301 --> 02:01:06,761
Not bad.

1067
02:01:06,969 --> 02:01:09,889
Where is Lord Hideyori?

1068
02:01:10,473 --> 02:01:12,183
Oh, we gave him a sleeping pill.

1069
02:01:12,183 --> 02:01:15,269
He kept saying he wanted to kill himself...

1070
02:01:15,436 --> 02:01:16,812
Hey!

1071
02:01:23,152 --> 02:01:25,654
Hotaru, thank you.

1072
02:01:26,781 --> 02:01:33,204
You've been my friend since childhood.
Besides, I got your message.

1073
02:01:34,455 --> 02:01:38,125
Let's get the hell out of here!

1074
02:01:38,459 --> 02:01:40,544
Right, let's hurry.

1075
02:01:42,087 --> 02:01:46,967
Lord Hideyori, time to say good-bye.

1076
02:01:48,594 --> 02:01:53,265
I did it because I loved you.

1077
02:02:04,235 --> 02:02:08,781
Sir Hideyori will go with you,
please take care of him.

1078
02:02:14,495 --> 02:02:19,291
Say, where are you going?

1079
02:02:21,919 --> 02:02:27,258
To show respect to the people who died for us,

1080
02:02:27,258 --> 02:02:29,718
I must perform hara-kiri.

1081
02:02:48,779 --> 02:02:50,906
Right, let's hurry!

1082
02:02:51,407 --> 02:02:52,700
Yes!

1083
02:03:02,418 --> 02:03:08,549
Good luck with Lord Yukimura,
you'll see him soon.

1084
02:04:54,405 --> 02:04:59,576
<i>The Warring States era...</i>

1085
02:04:59,952 --> 02:05:04,206
<i>finally ended that day.</i>

1086
02:05:33,444 --> 02:05:35,988
We'll change boats at Shikoku Takamatsu.

1087
02:05:36,321 --> 02:05:40,659
It will take 7 days to reach Bizen Kokura.

1088
02:05:41,285 --> 02:05:46,290
Then we'll travel the highways on
foot for 4 days to end up in Satsuma.

1089
02:05:48,500 --> 02:05:50,002
I see.

1090
02:05:54,006 --> 02:05:59,136
Are you still thinking about your mother?

1091
02:06:04,308 --> 02:06:06,435
She was a great lady.

1092
02:06:10,814 --> 02:06:12,524
Sasuke, thank you.

1093
02:06:15,611 --> 02:06:17,571
You've been so kind.

1094
02:06:20,908 --> 02:06:22,659
Oh, not at all.

1095
02:06:24,369 --> 02:06:29,833
But I wasn't thinking about mother.

1096
02:06:30,584 --> 02:06:32,836
I was thinking about potatoes.

1097
02:06:35,005 --> 02:06:36,632
Potatoes?

1098
02:06:36,924 --> 02:06:39,343
Satsuma is famous for fine potatoes.

1099
02:06:39,551 --> 02:06:43,764
They're so delicious, I can't wait to eat some!

1100
02:06:48,268 --> 02:06:50,938
You want to...?
Jinpachi?

1101
02:06:51,063 --> 02:06:52,314
Ha! You got me!

1102
02:06:52,314 --> 02:06:56,193
Son of a bitch!
Hey, no dinner for you!

1103
02:06:56,401 --> 02:06:58,237
You rat! Pulling my leg!

1104
02:06:58,237 --> 02:07:00,322
I'll get you for this!

1105
02:07:00,447 --> 02:07:02,783
Sasuke!
- Yeah?

1106
02:07:03,617 --> 02:07:06,411
I want to ask you...
- What's that?

1107
02:07:06,787 --> 02:07:09,248
Miss Hotaru, what did you tell her?

1108
02:07:10,249 --> 02:07:13,127
Easy! Okay okay okay!

1109
02:07:13,377 --> 02:07:15,671
Saizo keeps asking...

1110
02:07:15,796 --> 02:07:20,843
Wonder if Hotaru would be
my wife and stuff like that.

1111
02:07:23,053 --> 02:07:24,596
Really?

1112
02:07:25,514 --> 02:07:27,057
If you agree...

1113
02:07:27,057 --> 02:07:29,768
Follow me and save him.
He loves you.

1114
02:07:30,018 --> 02:07:31,270
You like that?

1115
02:07:31,270 --> 02:07:33,230
Cut it out!
When did I say that?

1116
02:07:33,313 --> 02:07:36,400
If I didn't say it, she probably
wouldn't have helped us out!

1117
02:07:36,441 --> 02:07:38,527
You can't do this!

1118
02:07:46,160 --> 02:07:48,453
It was just a lie?

1119
02:07:49,788 --> 02:07:53,917
Yes and no.

1120
02:07:57,504 --> 02:08:01,675
Please calm down, Hotaru.

1121
02:08:01,884 --> 02:08:03,886
It's true.
- True!

1122
02:08:03,886 --> 02:08:06,805
I swear! Trust me.

1123
02:08:07,389 --> 02:08:09,516
Prepare!
- Wait a minute!

1124
02:08:09,641 --> 02:08:11,101
Let me explain!
- Let him!

1125
02:08:11,101 --> 02:08:13,020
I can explain!
- He can!

1126
02:08:22,070 --> 02:08:26,742
I'll never forgive you!

1127
02:08:32,831 --> 02:08:35,500
So, what is the truth...

1128
02:08:35,626 --> 02:08:38,086
And what indeed is the lie?

1129
02:09:16,500 --> 02:09:23,590
