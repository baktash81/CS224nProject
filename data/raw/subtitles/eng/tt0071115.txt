[Both laughing]

1013
01:21:59,711 --> 01:22:02,005
Honey, if you change your mind,
just let me know.

1014
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,299
ALICE: I sure will.

1015
01:22:05,968 --> 01:22:08,053
ALICE: Isn't that sun wonderful?

1016
01:22:11,807 --> 01:22:14,726
-Is today the Ripple day?
-No, not today.

1017
01:22:15,144 --> 01:22:17,855
-You want to steal something?
-Steal what?

1018
01:22:17,855 --> 01:22:21,191
-I don't know. What do you need?
-Nothing, really.

1019
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,068
What do you want?

1020
01:22:23,068 --> 01:22:27,239
Nothing, except some guitar strings,
but they're real expensive.

1021
01:22:28,699 --> 01:22:31,827
-Where are they, at Chicago music store?
-Yeah.

1022
01:22:32,452 --> 01:22:34,121
AUDREY: Let's go, darling.

1023
01:22:43,297 --> 01:22:44,548
Come on.

1024
01:22:50,804 --> 01:22:52,055
[Audrey groaning]

1025
01:22:52,055 --> 01:22:53,307
Are you all right?

1026
01:22:53,307 --> 01:22:55,601
-My knee.
-What happened?

1027
01:22:55,809 --> 01:22:58,312
There's a slick spot on your floor.

1028
01:22:58,729 --> 01:23:01,648
I hope this doesn't ruin
my tryout for cheerleader.

1029
01:23:01,648 --> 01:23:05,611
I'm so sorry. Maybe you just stumbled.

1030
01:23:06,236 --> 01:23:09,990
-Thank you very much, sir.
-Good luck on your cheerleading.

1031
01:23:14,369 --> 01:23:17,915
DAVID: I'd rather take a whipping
than mend fences.

1032
01:23:20,417 --> 01:23:23,754
Maybe it would be easier
to get an electric fence.

1033
01:23:25,005 --> 01:23:26,048
Not really.

1034
01:23:26,256 --> 01:23:28,967
They'd be out in about a week, anyway.

1035
01:23:28,967 --> 01:23:32,930
They smell the apples over there
and get wilder than a guinea.

1036
01:23:34,598 --> 01:23:36,475
ALICE: What does?
DAVID: The cows.

1037
01:23:36,683 --> 01:23:39,603
DAVID: Don't try and understand a cow.
ALICE: Okay.

1038
01:23:39,603 --> 01:23:41,897
DAVID: The only thing dumber than a cow
is a chicken.

1039
01:23:41,897 --> 01:23:43,774
Turkeys are worse.

1040
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:47,736
You know what a little turkey does
when it rains?

1041
01:23:48,779 --> 01:23:53,158
Put their head back
and open up their mouths and drown.

1042
01:23:53,575 --> 01:23:55,661
ALICE: They do not.
DAVID: They do, too.

1043
01:23:56,078 --> 01:24:00,666
My grandmother lost about 200 of them
once in one rainstorm.

1044
01:24:05,879 --> 01:24:08,173
ALICE: Could I touch your beard?

1045
01:24:12,344 --> 01:24:13,804
ALICE: It's soft.

1046
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:42,166
DAVID: Your brother taught you to kiss?
ALICE: I don't mean he demonstrated.

1047
01:24:42,166 --> 01:24:44,459
He told me that
the worst thing that can happen...

1048
01:24:44,668 --> 01:24:48,630
is if a boy feels like he's put his lips
in a bowl of wet oatmeal.

1049
01:24:48,630 --> 01:24:50,716
At least he said "lips."

1050
01:24:53,635 --> 01:24:56,346
So the most important thing
to remember before you kiss...

1051
01:24:56,555 --> 01:24:59,475
is to wipe your mouth real good
and keep your lips together...

1052
01:24:59,475 --> 01:25:01,560
so he doesn't kiss your teeth.

1053
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:04,688
<i>We went to see
The Postman Always Rings Twice.</i>

1054
01:25:05,522 --> 01:25:09,485
And there was this big close-up of....
What's her name?

1055
01:25:09,485 --> 01:25:12,613
Lana Turner and John Garfield, right?
They're coming together.

1056
01:25:12,613 --> 01:25:15,115
Big dramatic moment.
At last, they're going to kiss.

1057
01:25:15,115 --> 01:25:16,992
ALICE: The music's playing. Very dramatic.

1058
01:25:16,992 --> 01:25:20,329
Just as they come together,
they both open their mouths.

1059
01:25:20,329 --> 01:25:24,082
I thought, "My God, don't they know
how to kiss? What's wrong with them?"

1060
01:25:24,082 --> 01:25:27,628
I turned and looked at my brother
to see what he was going to say.

1061
01:25:27,628 --> 01:25:30,130
ALICE: He didn't move,
he was just looking at screen.

1062
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:32,007
ALICE: He didn't say anything
for three weeks.

1063
01:25:32,007 --> 01:25:34,718
Then all of a sudden one day, he says:

1064
01:25:35,135 --> 01:25:37,429
"Well, Al, I've been thinking."

1065
01:25:37,638 --> 01:25:40,140
DAVID: Al?
ALICE: Yes, he always called me Al.

1066
01:25:41,183 --> 01:25:45,562
"l think maybe you're supposed to
part your lips a little bit when you kiss."

1067
01:25:45,562 --> 01:25:47,231
God bless him.

1068
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:50,359
If not, I had my work cut out for me.

1069
01:25:50,359 --> 01:25:52,236
ALICE: So anyway, and then...

1070
01:25:52,653 --> 01:25:55,781
we decided we wanted to go
into show business from the movies.

1071
01:25:55,989 --> 01:25:57,658
Why did you leave?

1072
01:25:58,075 --> 01:26:02,871
I got married, and Donald
wanted to live in his hometown.

1073
01:26:04,122 --> 01:26:05,165
I wanted to go on singing.

1074
01:26:05,165 --> 01:26:08,710
He said, "No wife of mine
is going to sing in a saloon."

1075
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:11,839
I said, "Yes, master." I kind of liked that.

1076
01:26:11,839 --> 01:26:15,384
DAVID: You liked it?
ALICE: It was like, you know...

1077
01:26:16,218 --> 01:26:19,138
my idea of a man: strong and dominating.

1078
01:26:19,763 --> 01:26:22,057
[Both laughing]

1079
01:26:22,683 --> 01:26:25,185
I'll show you our act.
This is what we used to do.

1080
01:26:25,394 --> 01:26:28,313
I figure, I don't know,
the bubble dancer didn't show up.

1081
01:26:28,313 --> 01:26:30,816
So they called my brother and I.

1082
01:26:31,233 --> 01:26:34,361
My brother would enter and walk onstage,
and I'd be behind him...

1083
01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:37,698
making the same moves,
so that you couldn't see me from the front.

1084
01:26:37,906 --> 01:26:41,451
And then he'd get out and say,
"Usually I do an act with my sister...

1085
01:26:41,451 --> 01:26:43,328
"but she didn't show up today."

1086
01:26:43,328 --> 01:26:47,708
And then I would....
Then they would laugh again.

1087
01:26:47,708 --> 01:26:51,253
-So we'd do it on the other side, right?
-That's a hell of an act.

1088
01:26:51,461 --> 01:26:55,424
That's what we did.
That was my start in show business.

1089
01:26:56,049 --> 01:26:58,552
ALICE: And then--
DAVID: Tough act to follow.

1090
01:26:59,178 --> 01:27:02,306
ALICE: We never got paid for it.
I found out years later...

1091
01:27:02,306 --> 01:27:05,017
that people got paid
for being in show business.

1092
01:27:05,017 --> 01:27:09,188
When I was 19, I got a job
in this really nice hotel in Monterey.

1093
01:27:09,605 --> 01:27:13,150
I would play the piano and sing.
I really liked it there.

1094
01:27:13,150 --> 01:27:16,904
That's why I want to go back
and pick up where I left off.

1095
01:27:19,823 --> 01:27:22,534
DAVID: Which do you want?
ALICE: What do you mean?

1096
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:25,662
Do you want to go home,
or do you want to sing?

1097
01:27:25,662 --> 01:27:28,790
I want to do both. Can't I have everything?

1098
01:27:29,625 --> 01:27:33,795
-You think they're the same?
-You mean, they're not?

1099
01:27:35,464 --> 01:27:37,966
I don't know. That was a while ago.

1100
01:27:39,009 --> 01:27:40,886
I have an idea, fella.

1101
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:44,640
DAVID: I've been getting one myself.

1102
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:48,393
ALICE: An idea?
DAVID: Yeah. What's yours?

1103
01:27:49,436 --> 01:27:53,190
-I have to show it to you.
-What?

1104
01:27:55,275 --> 01:27:59,238
If you come with me into the other room,
I'll show you my idea...

1105
01:27:59,238 --> 01:28:01,114
if you'll show me yours.

1106
01:28:01,532 --> 01:28:03,408
TOMMY: Shoot the dog!

1107
01:28:05,911 --> 01:28:09,248
Didn't you get it? I'll tell it to you.

1108
01:28:09,456 --> 01:28:11,542
In the beginning, the guy's saying:

1109
01:28:11,542 --> 01:28:14,670
"What do you want me
to do with the gun?" He doesn't tell him.

1110
01:28:14,670 --> 01:28:17,172
Then the guy says, "Shoot the dog."

1111
01:28:18,006 --> 01:28:20,300
He says, "Shoot the dog."

1112
01:28:20,717 --> 01:28:22,386
He says, "Shoot the dog."

1113
01:28:22,386 --> 01:28:26,557
Wait a minute.
Do you see why he said shoot the dog?

1114
01:28:31,770 --> 01:28:33,647
Hi, what are you two up to?

1115
01:28:33,856 --> 01:28:38,443
-We're gonna go fishing by this--
-By a spring-fed lake by Pittsville.

1116
01:28:38,443 --> 01:28:42,614
-A spring-fed lake up by Pittsville.
-We need four cheeseburgers to go.

1117
01:28:42,614 --> 01:28:47,619
Okay, four cheeseburgers.
You know what happened today?

1118
01:28:47,619 --> 01:28:50,747
ALICE: Guy up the street got robbed--
DAVID: Start the burgers.

1119
01:28:50,747 --> 01:28:54,710
We're running late.
Then come back and tell us all about it.

1120
01:28:57,004 --> 01:29:00,549
-Will there be anything else, sir?
-I guess not.

1121

TOMMY: What? Hog got your tongue?
DAVID: There goes the fishing trip.

1122

She's leaking oil.
I got to take her to Charlie's.

1123
01:29:10,976 --> 01:29:13,896
TOMMY: Did you ask?
ALICE: He said he can't ruin his truck...

1124
01:29:13,896 --> 01:29:17,232
so you can catch a fish. Got it?

1125
01:29:21,195 --> 01:29:22,863

01:32:33,262 --> 01:32:37,224
That's why he's got the foulest mouth
on any kid I've ever seen.

1173
01:32:37,432 --> 01:32:41,186
ALICE: When does he ever hear me swear?
DAVID: You spoil him rotten.

1174
01:32:42,437 --> 01:32:44,731
That kid thinks he can do
whatever he wants to do...

1175
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:47,234
whenever he wants
and wherever he wants to do it.

1176
01:32:47,234 --> 01:32:49,736
So do you. You're just as selfish as he is.

1177
01:32:49,945 --> 01:32:52,656
You want what you want
when you want it.

1178
01:32:53,699 --> 01:32:56,201
I really don't think
you understand kids at all.

1179
01:32:56,201 --> 01:32:57,661
You do?

1180
01:32:58,704 --> 01:33:00,998
What is that supposed to mean?

1181
01:33:01,623 --> 01:33:04,334
-Forget it.
-No, I won't forget it!

1182
01:33:04,334 --> 01:33:06,628
How dare you tell me
how to bring up my child!

1183
01:33:06,628 --> 01:33:09,548
How dare you! Where are your children?

1184
01:33:11,842 --> 01:33:14,553
I know exactly what I'm doing!

1185
01:33:16,221 --> 01:33:19,766
DAVID: Yeah. That's why you can't
make up your mind about your kid...

1186
01:33:19,766 --> 01:33:22,478
your job, Monterey, or me.

1187
01:33:24,563 --> 01:33:27,483
You're wrong. I just made it up.

1188
01:33:34,156 --> 01:33:37,075
Aren't you going to open the door for me?

1189
01:33:50,422 --> 01:33:52,299
ALICE: Come on, Tommy, get in.

1190
01:33:52,716 --> 01:33:56,261
What are you going to do, walk 10 miles?
Get in, dope.

1191
01:34:03,352 --> 01:34:06,271
TOMMY: Now what?
ALICE: What do you mean, now what?

1192
01:34:07,314 --> 01:34:09,608
TOMMY: You said we'd be in Monterey
by my birthday...

1193
01:34:09,608 --> 01:34:11,693
we'd get there,
and everything would be fine.

1194
01:34:11,902 --> 01:34:15,239
-We'll get there.
-Said the waitress in Tucson.

1195
01:34:15,239 --> 01:34:19,618
What's wrong with being a waitress?
I'm supporting you with it, aren't I?

1196
01:34:19,618 --> 01:34:23,372
-For God's sake, we'll get there.
-You never ask me what I want to do.

1197
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:27,334
ALICE: Sure I do. We're in this together.
TOMMY: When you say so.

1198
01:34:28,794 --> 01:34:31,713
ALICE: Who the hell
do you think you are, buddy?

1199
01:34:32,131 --> 01:34:34,007
I said we'll get there.

1200
01:34:34,007 --> 01:34:37,970
If you can find a job,
if it pays more than $50 a week...

1201
01:34:37,970 --> 01:34:41,306
and if you don't get involved
with another maniac.

1202
01:34:41,723 --> 01:34:44,434
Who cares? I don't give a damn.

1203
01:34:45,477 --> 01:34:47,771
If you open your mouth once more...

1204
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:50,899
I swear to God, I'm going to nail it shut.

1205
01:34:52,359 --> 01:34:54,444
I'm warning you, Tommy. I mean it now.

1206
01:34:54,444 --> 01:34:59,032
I'll stop the car and push you out,
and you'll walk the last mile home.

1207
01:34:59,867 --> 01:35:01,118
ALICE: All right.

1208
01:35:08,417 --> 01:35:10,711
ALICE: Out. Get out.

1209
01:35:12,171 --> 01:35:13,422
ALICE: Go. Walk.

1210
01:35:18,844 --> 01:35:21,346
AUDREY: My dad was a bastard, all right.

1211
01:35:21,555 --> 01:35:25,517
He used to make me bend over
while he whipped me with his belt.

1212
01:35:25,517 --> 01:35:28,228
I still think about going up to him
and saying:

1213
01:35:28,228 --> 01:35:32,608
"All right, Harry, bend over.
You're going to get the belt for that."

1214
01:35:36,987 --> 01:35:39,698
Yeah, mine was a bastard, too.

1215
01:35:41,366 --> 01:35:42,826
Or I guess so.

1216
01:35:43,660 --> 01:35:45,120
I don't know.

1217
01:35:45,746 --> 01:35:48,248
You going to be going to school
in Tucson?

1218
01:35:48,457 --> 01:35:50,959
No. My mom says
we're going to Monterey.

1219
01:35:50,959 --> 01:35:54,087
Monterey? You know,
you're lucky to get out of Tucson.

1220
01:35:54,087 --> 01:35:57,007
The school here is weird, let me tell you.

1221
01:35:57,216 --> 01:36:00,969
Mr. Emmet, the science teacher,
wears a hairnet.

1222
01:36:02,012 --> 01:36:04,306
Scary. Really scary.

1223
01:36:07,226 --> 01:36:09,311
Can I have some more wine?

1224
01:36:11,814 --> 01:36:13,899
Tommy, are you in there?

1225
01:36:16,610 --> 01:36:18,070
ALICE: Tommy?

1226
01:36:47,266 --> 01:36:48,725
What did I do?

1227
01:37:14,376 --> 01:37:16,044
[Sobbing]

1228
01:37:22,301 --> 01:37:24,803
Come on, honey, let's do something.

1229
01:37:28,974 --> 01:37:31,059
I don't feel so wonderful.

1230
01:37:34,813 --> 01:37:37,524
Put another quarter in and try again.

1231
01:37:38,984 --> 01:37:41,695
[Telephone ringing]

1232
01:37:48,994 --> 01:37:50,871
Hello? Yes?

1233
01:37:53,790 --> 01:37:55,042
Is he okay?

1234
01:37:55,250 --> 01:37:56,710
Thank God.

1235
01:37:58,378 --> 01:37:59,421
Sure.

1236
01:38:00,255 --> 01:38:01,298
Thank you.

1237
01:38:01,507 --> 01:38:04,218
The market's not going to
press any charges, Mrs. Hyatt.

1238
01:38:04,218 --> 01:38:07,137
-Thank God.
-They had a nice long talk with Tommy.

1239
01:38:07,137 --> 01:38:09,014
He's right over there.

1240
01:38:09,014 --> 01:38:11,099
-What's he wearing?
-He's got a sweatshirt on.

1241
01:38:11,308 --> 01:38:13,185
He got a little sick. Here are his things.

1242
01:38:13,185 --> 01:38:15,270
-He was sick?
-Too much wine.

1243
01:38:15,270 --> 01:38:16,522
I see.

1244
01:38:20,067 --> 01:38:22,361
You're the singing waitress?

1245
01:38:23,195 --> 01:38:26,949
ALICE: I'm Tommy's mother.
AUDREY: I'm Audrey. It's nice to meet you.

1246
01:38:27,783 --> 01:38:29,660
It's nice to meet you, Audrey.

1247
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:32,162
Tell me, how did all this happen?

1248
01:38:32,371 --> 01:38:35,499
It was just a big mistake.

1249
01:38:35,916 --> 01:38:37,793
-Big mistake.
-Whose?

1250
01:38:39,253 --> 01:38:40,712
The store's.

1251
01:38:41,338 --> 01:38:43,423
Doris, come on, let's go.

1252
01:38:44,049 --> 01:38:45,300
I got to go.

1253
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:48,846
Ramada Rose is upset,
so you tell Tommy I said goodbye.

1254
01:38:48,846 --> 01:38:50,305
Yes, I will.

1255
01:38:54,893 --> 01:38:56,562
Would you come on?

1256
01:38:59,064 --> 01:39:00,941
So long, suckers!

1257
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:09,700
He's all yours.

1258
01:39:09,700 --> 01:39:11,785
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1259
01:39:34,099 --> 01:39:36,185
You look like you've been embalmed.

1260
01:39:36,602 --> 01:39:38,479
[Alarm clock buzzing]

1261
01:39:42,858 --> 01:39:46,195
TOMMY: What happened?
ALICE: It's all right. Go back to sleep.

1262
01:40:00,167 --> 01:40:01,835
[Knocking on door]

1263
01:40:03,295 --> 01:40:04,546
What?

1264
01:40:04,546 --> 01:40:05,589
VERA: Alice?

1265
01:40:05,798 --> 01:40:07,883
ALICE: Yeah?
VERA: You're late for work.

1266
01:40:09,968 --> 01:40:12,262
I know. I'm sorry, I overslept.

1267
01:40:12,888 --> 01:40:14,556
I'll be right there.

1268
01:40:23,941 --> 01:40:25,192
You okay?

1269
01:40:26,860 --> 01:40:28,946
Isn't David coming in today?

1270
01:40:30,405 --> 01:40:32,491
You want to talk about it?

1271
01:40:33,534 --> 01:40:35,828
Alice, come here, honey.
Come on. Come here.

1272
01:40:36,036 --> 01:40:37,704
FLO: Come on, sugar, right now.

1273
01:40:37,913 --> 01:40:39,998
FLO: Come on, honey.

1274
01:40:39,998 --> 01:40:42,709
-Flo, the combinations are ready.
-Mel!

1275
01:40:49,174 --> 01:40:52,928
FLO: We're going right here
and have us a little talk. Come on.

1276
01:40:53,762 --> 01:40:55,639
Come on in here, Alice.

1277
01:40:56,473 --> 01:40:57,933
Shut that door.

1278
01:40:58,142 --> 01:40:59,393
[Alice sobbing]

1279
01:40:59,393 --> 01:41:01,895
Everything gets so screwed up.

1280
01:41:03,355 --> 01:41:04,606
I know.

1281
01:41:05,858 --> 01:41:08,986
I don't know. I just.... I tried and....

1282
01:41:11,697 --> 01:41:14,616
I don't know. I met David, and then...

1283
01:41:15,033 --> 01:41:17,953
I spent all the money
I had saved to get to Monterey...

1284
01:41:18,162 --> 01:41:21,915
for Tommy's birthday present.
You know, his cowboy outfit.

1285
01:41:22,958 --> 01:41:26,086
I don't know. I got sidetracked, and then....

1286
01:41:27,754 --> 01:41:29,423
Gosh, I was so....

1287
01:41:30,674 --> 01:41:33,177
I was so scared of Donald, you know?

1288
01:41:34,011 --> 01:41:37,347
I was always trying to please him.
I was so afraid not to please him.

1289
01:41:37,347 --> 01:41:40,267
-You were scared of him?
-God, yes.

1290
01:41:44,438 --> 01:41:46,315
And now I'm without him.

1291
01:41:46,732 --> 01:41:50,486
I mean, it's like I always felt
that he was taking care of me...

1292
01:41:50,694 --> 01:41:52,988
and now I just don't know what to do.

1293
01:41:53,197 --> 01:41:56,325
Honey, it's nice
to have somebody take care of you.

1294
01:41:56,325 --> 01:41:57,784
But he didn't.

1295
01:41:57,784 --> 01:42:00,913
I just felt like he did
just because he was there.

1296
01:42:02,164 --> 01:42:05,709
I don't know how to live without a man,
that's what it is.

1297
01:42:06,335 --> 01:42:08,629
FLO: I want to tell you something.

1298
01:42:09,671 --> 01:42:12,382
My life ain't exactly a bed of petunias.

1299
01:42:13,842 --> 01:42:17,387
I got me a daughter,
cutest little thing you ever saw.

1300
01:42:18,222 --> 01:42:20,516
She needs about $4,000 worth
of dental work...

1301
01:42:20,516 --> 01:42:23,227
else she's going to have buck teeth.

1302
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:30,108
What am I going to do?
I ain't got any money.

1303
01:42:30,108 --> 01:42:31,777
My old man....

1304
01:42:32,402 --> 01:42:35,739
Honey, he ain't talked to me
since the day Kennedy got shot.

1305
01:42:35,948 --> 01:42:38,867
What, did he think you had
something to do with it?

1306
01:42:39,076 --> 01:42:40,118
[Flo laughing]

1307
01:42:40,327 --> 01:42:42,830
FLO: Look at that face. Look at that body.

1308
01:42:43,038 --> 01:42:45,749
Honey, the Lord blessed you with talent.
You can sing.

1309
01:42:45,958 --> 01:42:48,043
I don't know about that.
You never heard me sing.

1310
01:42:48,252 --> 01:42:51,171
You got to be good at it. You had a job.

1311
01:42:51,171 --> 01:42:54,299
I used to be good when I was a kid.
But I'm not good anymore.

1312
01:42:54,299 --> 01:42:58,262
-My voice has a wiggle in it.
-I won't bullshit you.

1313
01:42:58,262 --> 01:43:02,641
You better get that wiggle out of
your voice or take up something else.

1314
01:43:09,731 --> 01:43:12,651
I'm so mad at David, I could just kill him.
I really could.

1315
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:14,736
I could just kill him.

1316
01:43:15,154 --> 01:43:17,656
-Sounds to me like you love him.
-No.

1317
01:43:19,324 --> 01:43:20,367
I do.

1318
01:43:23,495 --> 01:43:24,538
[Knocking on door]

1319
01:43:24,746 --> 01:43:26,832
MEL: Flo, what the hell
is going on in there?

1320
01:43:26,832 --> 01:43:30,377
FLO: Beat it. We'll be back in a minute.
MEL: Vera's going crazy in there!

1321
01:43:30,586 --> 01:43:32,671
-Give us a minute.
-I won't give you a minute--

1322
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:36,008
Open that door again, you'll run
a 3-legged race to the undertaker.

1323
01:43:36,216 --> 01:43:37,468
You don't know what's going on.

1324
01:43:37,468 --> 01:43:39,553
You want to get through the day
with just Vera?

1325
01:43:39,761 --> 01:43:41,430
Don't do this to me.

1326
01:43:41,847 --> 01:43:43,724
[People screaming]

1327
01:43:49,980 --> 01:43:52,483
Will you please tell him....

1328
01:43:58,322 --> 01:44:01,033
Yeah, I know, but it's my life.

1329
01:44:01,241 --> 01:44:04,161
It's not some man's life
that I'll help him out with.

1330
01:44:04,161 --> 01:44:05,621
No, ma'am.

1331
01:44:06,455 --> 01:44:08,957
I can't help it. That's the way I feel.

1332
01:44:08,957 --> 01:44:10,834
What is it you want?

1333
01:44:11,668 --> 01:44:16,048
If I knew that, I wouldn't be out here
crying in the toilet, would I?

1334
01:44:18,550 --> 01:44:20,844
-Alice, have you seen this?
-Yeah.

1335
01:44:21,053 --> 01:44:23,138
-I made it myself.
-Did you?
