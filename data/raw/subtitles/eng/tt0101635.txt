1
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,794
You lived with him when he was nothing.

2
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:11,062
You suffered his youth
and endured the years of struggle.

3
00:04:11,132 --> 00:04:13,760
You're entitled to half
of everything he has.

4
00:04:15,236 --> 00:04:18,330
l'm not married,
so l don't know what it's like...

5
00:04:18,406 --> 00:04:21,068
to face the conclusion
of a decades-old relationship.

6
00:04:21,142 --> 00:04:23,372
And l don't have children, so l can't say...

7
00:04:23,445 --> 00:04:27,313
how the final disposition of the offspring
would impact me emotionally.

8
00:04:27,415 --> 00:04:29,076
But l can say this much.

9
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,847
You have it within your means
to grind your husband into the ground.

10
00:04:35,824 --> 00:04:38,486
l don't know if l want to go quite that far.

11
00:04:41,396 --> 00:04:45,162
Mrs. Arnold, you came to me
because you wanted financial protection.

12
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:48,459
lf you want sympathy,
you won't get it here.

13
00:04:48,536 --> 00:04:51,801
You won't get emotion from me,
l'm not an emotional person.

14
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:57,303
What does grinding him
into the ground involve?

15
00:04:59,214 --> 00:05:01,011
Going for his weakest spot.

16
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:03,374
He's a public man, a politician.

17
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:05,783
-You threaten his image.
-How?

18
00:05:06,154 --> 00:05:09,885
We immediately begin documenting
his sexual improprieties.

19
00:05:12,927 --> 00:05:14,622
That's awfully personal.

20
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:27,459
Table for two, please.

21
00:06:29,037 --> 00:06:31,335
Nonsmoking.
By the window, if you have it.

22
00:06:31,406 --> 00:06:32,395
Tesio.

23
00:06:36,477 --> 00:06:41,437
Tesio, go and notify Albert
that we have a situation.

24
00:06:43,051 --> 00:06:46,179
l have no tables. They're all reserved.

25
00:06:46,454 --> 00:06:48,854
Are you familiar with the city ordinance...

26
00:06:48,923 --> 00:06:51,915
Title 2, Chapter 160, Section 010?

27
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:56,429
''All persons shall have equal access
to public services,'' and so forth and so on.

28
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:59,957
ln short, l have every right
to be in this restaurant.

29
00:07:00,368 --> 00:07:03,235
Not so long as that restaurant
has a dress code...

30
00:07:03,571 --> 00:07:06,699
-and that dress code requires a tie--
-Tie? Right here.

31
00:07:13,414 --> 00:07:17,441
Well, l guess it's time for me
to be moving on. Thank you very much--

32
00:07:17,752 --> 00:07:20,243
l don't need the help. lt's not necessary.

33
00:07:21,122 --> 00:07:22,612
No, no!

34
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,061
Why don't you pick on someone
your own size, you big, ugly chump?

35
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:42,608
Mrs. Arnold dropped by
to say hello on her way out.

36
00:07:43,077 --> 00:07:45,705
She looked like she'd seen a ghost.
What did you do?

37
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,645
Told her what her options are.

38
00:07:47,715 --> 00:07:50,343
l don't think she wants
to destroy her husband...

39
00:07:50,418 --> 00:07:54,081
and l don't want this firm being known
for ruining Frank Arnold.

40
00:07:54,255 --> 00:07:56,348
Don't tell me how to do my work.

41
00:07:58,493 --> 00:08:01,656
Go easy on this divorce,
or l'll put another attorney on it.

42
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,993
Who are you trying to protect?

43
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:07,034
A law firm, a wife, kids....

44
00:08:07,568 --> 00:08:10,435
Things you know nothing about, Grey,
and l feel sorry for you.

45
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:13,406
-Well, don't lose too much sleep.
-Hey, lighten up!

46
00:08:14,008 --> 00:08:17,671
You keep going at 190 miles an hour,
you're going to hit something.

47
00:08:23,284 --> 00:08:25,377
All right, take this stick...

48
00:08:25,954 --> 00:08:29,617
and l want you to crack me
right on the top of the head, all right?

49
00:08:29,824 --> 00:08:30,916
Forget it.

50
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:33,150
Honey, you have to do it.

51
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:35,722
lt's not going to hurt me, l swear.

52
00:08:36,097 --> 00:08:38,395
We talked about this
all the way from Detroit.

53
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:42,334
Yeah, but that was talking.
Talking is different than doing.

54
00:08:42,637 --> 00:08:46,232
Right, and if it wasn't, we could
talk our way into a million dollars...

55
00:08:46,307 --> 00:08:48,639
and a nice high-rise penthouse.

56
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,311
We have to do the doing,
not the talking. Come on.

57
00:08:54,682 --> 00:08:57,810
-You're going to cry.
-Have you ever seen me cry, honey?

58
00:08:58,086 --> 00:09:01,112
-No, but l've seen you sad.
-That's not crying, is it?

59
00:09:01,756 --> 00:09:05,522
You can cry and not feel sad,
just like you can feel sad and not cry.

60
00:09:05,593 --> 00:09:06,821
Now, come on.

61
00:09:07,028 --> 00:09:10,555
We've got to hurry with this.
We've got things to do, all right?

62
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,195
Now, however much you love me...

63
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:16,728
that's how hard you hit me, okay?

64
00:09:16,804 --> 00:09:19,364
-l love you a lot.
-Well, then...

65
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,666
the harder you hit me,
the more l know you love me.

66
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:26,973
-Okay.
-That a girl.

67
00:09:27,682 --> 00:09:28,808
All right.

68
00:09:50,571 --> 00:09:51,595
Dinner.

69
00:10:46,494 --> 00:10:48,519
You killed my daddy!

70
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,324
Help!

71
00:11:13,287 --> 00:11:15,414
This is a goddamn joke.

72
00:11:22,997 --> 00:11:27,093
She's looking at us.
Give her the $25 smile.

73
00:11:33,941 --> 00:11:36,705
Where in the name of all that's holy
have you been?

74
00:11:36,777 --> 00:11:38,472
l hit a man with my car.

75
00:11:38,913 --> 00:11:39,880
There.

76
00:11:40,681 --> 00:11:43,411
l almost had that lady's purse,
but you blew it.

77
00:11:43,618 --> 00:11:46,086
-l had it right in my hand.
-Tough. We don't steal.

78
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:47,382
But we cheat.

79
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:49,850
-A little, but we don't steal.
-We lie.

80
00:11:49,924 --> 00:11:53,155
A little more than we cheat,
but that's not right, either.

81
00:11:54,295 --> 00:11:55,956
lt's because of the times.

82
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,555
Right, we don't steal,
and we don't break any laws.

83
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:02,160
-Some laws we do.
-Not the good ones.

84
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,736
Stay there. l'll come get you.

85
00:12:05,406 --> 00:12:08,933
This stinks like trouble.
God, l don't need this. Where are you?

86
00:12:11,212 --> 00:12:13,840
Rocky Feller's House of Beef, on Randolph.

87
00:12:14,849 --> 00:12:16,578
Did anyone see you enter?

88
00:12:17,351 --> 00:12:18,716
l don't think so.

89
00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:20,548
l'll be there right away.

90
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,544
All done.

91
00:12:58,659 --> 00:13:02,459
You should have joined us, ma'am.
Wasn't that was a great meal, honey?

92
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,303
Sure dirty.

93
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,254
This angel's not only
the cutest girl in the world...

94
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:36,728
she's also the smartest.

95
00:13:36,797 --> 00:13:40,198
Why don't you spell something for her?
How about ''asphyxiate''?

96
00:13:41,369 --> 00:13:44,964
A-S-P...

97
00:13:45,406 --> 00:13:49,137
T-bone! Heavy on the meat!
Easy on the bone! Potato! Hot potato!

98
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:53,440
No, thank you, l've ridden
better-looking meat than that. Bear right.

99
00:13:53,581 --> 00:13:56,914
...l-A-T-E.

100
00:14:00,521 --> 00:14:02,614
You ever seen anything like that?

101
00:14:03,157 --> 00:14:05,682
That's a big word for such a little girl.

102
00:14:08,562 --> 00:14:10,757
Hello, Doris.

103
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:12,825
Let's go.

104
00:14:13,467 --> 00:14:16,766
This is the gentleman l mentioned
on the phone and his daughter.

105
00:14:16,837 --> 00:14:19,237
-Pleased to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, also.

106
00:14:19,307 --> 00:14:21,298
l'm William Dancer. Bill.

107
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,877
She's a pretty little girl.
You must be very proud.

108
00:14:27,615 --> 00:14:28,673
Doris....

109
00:14:32,286 --> 00:14:34,948
l'm extremely grateful
for your kindness, ma'am.

110
00:14:35,022 --> 00:14:37,616
You're a lucky man
to have such a good-hearted wife.

111
00:14:37,692 --> 00:14:39,319
No, we're not married--

112
00:14:40,494 --> 00:14:42,359
Good night, and good luck.

113
00:14:42,897 --> 00:14:45,092
We'd like to repay you for the meal.

114
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:47,928
-That's not necessary.
-No, the child here...

115
00:14:48,135 --> 00:14:52,196
makes a real pretty refrigerator picture.
She can draw just about anything.

116
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,567
Thank you, no. Good night.

117
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:09,580
We didn't get nothing but dinner.

118
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:13,120
She looked like $50 for sure.

119
00:15:14,328 --> 00:15:15,818
We take what we get.

120
00:15:17,131 --> 00:15:20,931
-We had her, Bill. The guy screwed it up.
-You know...

121
00:15:21,902 --> 00:15:25,702
that's just the kind of lady
you should be praying for to be your mom.

122
00:15:27,675 --> 00:15:29,404
Why? Who needs a mom?

123
00:15:29,477 --> 00:15:32,275
You don't have a mom,
and you came out all right.

124
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,449
Grab some napkins
and use the washroom.

125
00:15:39,387 --> 00:15:40,411
Okay.

126
00:15:41,956 --> 00:15:42,980
Here.

127
00:15:44,058 --> 00:15:45,525
Go brush your teeth.

128
00:15:45,593 --> 00:15:49,154
-l brushed my teeth in Detroit.
-So you brush your teeth in Chicago now.

129
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,128
Okay.

130
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,566
lf you're not back in five minutes,
l'll come.

131
00:15:55,636 --> 00:15:58,104
-ln a ladies' bathroom?
-That's right.

132
00:15:59,573 --> 00:16:01,370
Don't fool around in there.

133
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,700
What'll you give me for this?

134
00:18:43,103 --> 00:18:45,537
lt's not much. A ruby?

135
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,505
l don't know. You look at it.

136
00:18:48,576 --> 00:18:51,409
Look, l'll give you $15. Take it or leave it.

137
00:18:52,246 --> 00:18:53,213
Done.

138
00:18:53,881 --> 00:18:56,406
Now get out of here, before l call the cops.

139
00:18:57,785 --> 00:18:59,116
Thanks, you jerk.

140
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:14,694
-l'm sorry about your ring, honey.
-lt's okay.

141
00:19:14,902 --> 00:19:16,563
l'll get you another one.

142
00:19:16,637 --> 00:19:18,468
That would make me feel nervous.

143
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:20,336
Why would a ring make you nervous?

144
00:19:20,407 --> 00:19:24,400
When someone gives you something
to remember them by, it means they'll go.

145
00:19:24,478 --> 00:19:28,278
lf they're going to stay, you don't need
anything, because they'll be there.

146
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:29,873
You worry too much.

147
00:19:30,451 --> 00:19:34,649
Tell me about the Frank Arnold divorce.
lt sounds wonderfully filthy and sick.

148
00:19:35,556 --> 00:19:38,582
You know l can't tell you anything,
so why do you ask?

149
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:40,759
He's incredibly corrupt.

150
00:19:41,595 --> 00:19:43,790
What if you need a favor sometime?

151
00:19:44,031 --> 00:19:47,990
With the material l'm gathering,
l'll get favors for the rest of my life.

152
00:19:48,402 --> 00:19:50,768
Like what kind of material? Photos?

153
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:55,670
Let's change the subject.

154
00:19:58,412 --> 00:19:59,811
Something's wrong.

155
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:02,210
Something's bothering you.

156
00:20:02,616 --> 00:20:05,585
l can't stop thinking
about what happened last night.

157
00:20:06,754 --> 00:20:08,346
What's there to think about?

158
00:20:08,422 --> 00:20:10,413
lt happened. lt's over.

159
00:20:11,191 --> 00:20:13,386
You'll never see those people again.

160
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,130
-Hello?
-Walker.

161
00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:22,961
lt's mine.

162
00:20:29,343 --> 00:20:30,810
Don't you want any?

163
00:20:34,548 --> 00:20:36,539
l'll have what you don't finish.

164
00:20:37,051 --> 00:20:39,212
That won't be anything pretty soon.

165
00:20:43,424 --> 00:20:45,153
What part don't you want?

166
00:20:46,527 --> 00:20:48,961
-The meat?
-No, you need the meat.

167
00:20:49,763 --> 00:20:50,923
No, l don't.

168
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:56,132
All right, l'll take the meat.
You eat the egg. You need the egg.

169
00:20:56,203 --> 00:20:57,727
Okay. Here's the meat.

170
00:20:58,639 --> 00:21:00,504
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

171
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:05,274
Look, after we finish here...

172
00:21:06,346 --> 00:21:08,246
l need to check into a job...

173
00:21:08,749 --> 00:21:10,944
and then we'll go to the art museum.

174
00:21:14,154 --> 00:21:17,646
-l hate the art museum.
-Will it hurt you to learn a thing or two?

175
00:21:17,725 --> 00:21:20,956
All you learn from the art museum
is how to keep your mouth shut...

176
00:21:21,028 --> 00:21:23,724
and how to walk
without making your shoes squeak.

177
00:21:23,797 --> 00:21:26,265
All right, then l'll put you in school.

178
00:21:27,367 --> 00:21:32,327
-No, welfare people would take me away.
-Not if l have a job and a nice place to live.

179
00:21:33,073 --> 00:21:37,339
You haven't got legal custody. We'd get
caught and cops will throw you in jail.

180
00:21:37,611 --> 00:21:39,442
ls that a nice thing to say?

181
00:21:40,047 --> 00:21:43,710
We wouldn't even be talking about this
if you'd got money out of that lady.

182
00:21:43,784 --> 00:21:45,274
We'd be on the road.

183
00:21:45,652 --> 00:21:47,950
You didn't because she was too pretty.

184
00:21:49,723 --> 00:21:52,453
-She was too smart.
-And she was too pretty.

185
00:21:52,526 --> 00:21:54,960
-She was in a hurry.
-And she was too pretty.

186
00:21:55,028 --> 00:21:58,191
-She was going to catch onto us.
-And she was too pretty.

187
00:21:59,867 --> 00:22:02,392
You're pretty, and l don't leave you alone.

188
00:22:03,504 --> 00:22:04,766
She was too pretty.

189
00:22:04,838 --> 00:22:08,433
All right, if l say she was too pretty,
will you put a cork in it?

190
00:22:09,076 --> 00:22:10,065
Promise?

191
00:22:11,311 --> 00:22:12,778
She was too pretty.

192
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:20,917
l knew it!

193
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,356
Hubba-hubba.

194
00:22:35,602 --> 00:22:37,695
Grey!

195
00:22:38,605 --> 00:22:39,594
Grey.

196
00:22:39,907 --> 00:22:40,805
Grey!

197
00:22:43,544 --> 00:22:47,071
Slow down! My legs are moving so fast
my pantyhose are melting.

198
00:22:47,948 --> 00:22:50,007
Mrs. Arnold called. She sounded pissed.

199
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:53,052
She needs to see you tomorrow,
so l told her 2:30 pm, okay?

200
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,779
Fine.

201
00:22:53,854 --> 00:22:57,346
Walker called. He has a dinner meeting
and probably won't come over.

202
00:22:57,424 --> 00:23:00,291
But if you need to have sex,
that's what he said...

203
00:23:00,427 --> 00:23:02,793
go ahead over to his place
after your dinner.

204
00:23:02,863 --> 00:23:04,387
Call him and decline.

205
00:23:04,698 --> 00:23:07,428
-Mr. Oxbar--
-l really have to go.

206
00:23:12,306 --> 00:23:14,797
-We ain't beggars, right?
-Right.

207
00:23:15,342 --> 00:23:18,402
Then what's the point
of going to find that lady again?

208
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:20,078
-Are you hungry?
-Not much.

209
00:23:20,147 --> 00:23:23,742
Well, l am. There's no harm in showing
our face around her again...

210
00:23:23,817 --> 00:23:25,682
to see if she'll offer another meal.

211
00:23:25,752 --> 00:23:26,741
That's begging.

212
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,948
No, begging is asking in a pathetic fashion.

213
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,190
You're splitting hairs, Bill.

214
00:23:32,392 --> 00:23:35,623
Hell, l'd rather sing for my supper
than sit in a parking lot.

215
00:23:35,696 --> 00:23:37,630
They stink to all holy heaven.

216
00:23:38,632 --> 00:23:40,998
Look, we're going to wait in the garage...

217
00:23:41,068 --> 00:23:44,663
we'll look like we're doing some business,
and if she comes out...

218
00:23:44,938 --> 00:23:47,338
if she feels kind, we'll take her kindness.

219
00:23:47,407 --> 00:23:50,274
-And if she doesn't come out--
-We freeze our nuts off.

220
00:23:50,344 --> 00:23:52,904
You don't have any nuts
to freeze off, honey.

221
00:24:34,955 --> 00:24:38,550
Come on, baby. What's the matter?
This is the place. Let's go.

222
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:41,928
My lips are chapped
and l have to find my lip grease.

223
00:24:43,163 --> 00:24:44,130
Women.

224
00:25:02,382 --> 00:25:04,680
Now you've really killed him!

225
00:25:29,643 --> 00:25:32,908
There are no broken bones,
no contusions, no abrasions.

226
00:25:33,113 --> 00:25:35,206
A few lesions, not of your doing.

227
00:25:36,616 --> 00:25:39,449
That wound on his forehead
is a day or two old.

228
00:25:39,786 --> 00:25:41,310
l did that yesterday.

229
00:25:41,521 --> 00:25:42,920
You hit him twice?

230
00:25:44,825 --> 00:25:46,725
What he needs is soap...

231
00:25:47,027 --> 00:25:49,518
a razor, a good meal, bed rest...

232
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:52,330
and then a good swift kick in the behind.

233
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:55,266
You're crazy to let a person like that
stay in your house.

234
00:25:55,335 --> 00:25:57,360
The little girl is his daughter.

235
00:25:58,005 --> 00:26:00,098
She could use a little soap, too.

236
00:26:00,474 --> 00:26:02,465
This is a matter for the city...

237
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:04,840
not a single woman living alone.

238
00:26:05,512 --> 00:26:09,676
l'm sure it looks worse than it is.
l appreciate your concern, but it's okay.

239
00:26:14,688 --> 00:26:18,522
Sorry, l fell asleep,
seeing as how l was so extremely tired.

240
00:26:19,292 --> 00:26:22,728
You'll get to go to sleep
in just a minute, okay?

241
00:26:25,098 --> 00:26:27,566
-Thank you for coming up.
-Don't be silly.

242
00:26:27,768 --> 00:26:30,737
This is the stuff
of 10:00 news lead stories...

243
00:26:30,804 --> 00:26:32,271
but you're over 21 .

244
00:26:32,506 --> 00:26:34,497
l'll sleep with my door locked.

245
00:26:35,509 --> 00:26:38,967
l'm in the building. l can be here
in two seconds if you need me.

246
00:26:39,046 --> 00:26:40,775
-Thanks.
-Good night, dear.

247
00:27:56,289 --> 00:27:57,722
This is very excellent.

248
00:27:57,791 --> 00:28:00,487
l never knew pizza was so good
when it was hot.

249
00:28:04,331 --> 00:28:06,128
Think Bill would want some?

250
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:08,292
l think Bill's better off resting.

251
00:28:15,609 --> 00:28:19,136
His whole life is nothing
but a thousand miles of bad road.

252
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,878
The doctor said he's going to be fine.

253
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:26,711
Don't tell Bill he saw a doctor.
lt's against his faith.

254
00:28:29,723 --> 00:28:33,716
Oh, no. That's his
afraid-to-die-alone groan.

255
00:28:34,361 --> 00:28:38,195
You keep eating,
and l'll go see how he is, okay?

256
00:28:38,265 --> 00:28:40,733
Okay. Tell him to hold on...

257
00:28:41,067 --> 00:28:44,230
and tell him to be strong
and don't leave me.

258
00:28:44,938 --> 00:28:47,839
He's going to be all right.
He's not going anywhere.

259
00:29:12,899 --> 00:29:13,957
lt's me.

260
00:29:20,507 --> 00:29:24,739
-Where am l?
-ln my apartment. l hit you with my car.

261
00:29:26,012 --> 00:29:27,502
ls it yesterday?

262
00:29:28,381 --> 00:29:29,746
l hit you again.

263
00:29:32,852 --> 00:29:35,878
-Where's my child?
-She's in the kitchen eating pizza.

264
00:29:41,228 --> 00:29:42,320
Bigtime.

265
00:29:58,845 --> 00:30:00,642
lt's a shame we don't steal.

266
00:30:00,714 --> 00:30:03,945
Your daughter's had a bath,
and l have a room ready for her.

267
00:30:04,017 --> 00:30:06,417
l'd like you to at least stay the night.

268
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:14,624
-Are your folks religious people?
-Not really.

269
00:30:15,395 --> 00:30:17,295
-l'm surprised.
-Why?

270
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:21,733
Because you're a saint.

271
00:30:26,673 --> 00:30:28,903
There are fresh towels in the bathroom.

272
00:30:28,975 --> 00:30:31,375
l'll see that your daughter gets to bed.

273
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:38,642
Thank you.

274
00:30:41,388 --> 00:30:43,686
l have the apartment wired for security.

275
00:30:43,757 --> 00:30:46,726
There's a man downstairs.
l need only touch a button.

276
00:30:47,427 --> 00:30:50,863
l don't mean to be harsh or unkind...

277
00:30:51,131 --> 00:30:53,656
but l don't know you,
and you're in my home.

278
00:30:53,933 --> 00:30:58,165
Now, if you have any dishonest inklings,
l caution you that l'm no fool.

279
00:30:58,605 --> 00:31:00,095
l understand, ma'am.

280
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,898
Ma'am...

281
00:31:02,642 --> 00:31:04,007
for the record...

282
00:31:04,544 --> 00:31:05,909
l'm no criminal.

283
00:31:09,382 --> 00:31:10,508
Good night.

284
00:31:11,518 --> 00:31:14,043
Good night.

285
00:31:26,866 --> 00:31:28,595
How many people live here?

286
00:31:29,836 --> 00:31:32,100
-Just me.
-Whose are all those clothes?

287
00:31:32,372 --> 00:31:33,566
They're mine.

288
00:31:36,676 --> 00:31:39,543
-How come your bed's so huge?
-l like a big bed.

289
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,344
You got an awful lot of pillow
for just one person.

290
00:31:43,416 --> 00:31:44,405
Well....

291
00:31:44,751 --> 00:31:48,346
How come you have so many TVs?
l must have seen three already.

292
00:31:51,057 --> 00:31:52,183
How's this?

293
00:31:53,893 --> 00:31:57,852
lt won't be the most beautiful outfit
in the world, but l think it'll do.

294
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:02,567
How come this smells so good?

295
00:32:03,737 --> 00:32:04,863
lt's clean.

296
00:32:10,343 --> 00:32:13,210
Why don't you take
that room next to mine?

297
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,678
That'll be your room for tonight.

298
00:32:14,748 --> 00:32:17,444
Try that on,
and l'll come to say good night.

299
00:32:17,517 --> 00:32:19,109
Ma'am, you're so nice.

300
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,485
My name is Grey.

301
00:32:22,155 --> 00:32:24,680
-Mrs. Grey?
-No, just Grey.

302
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,521
-What's your name?
-Curly Sue.

303
00:32:31,364 --> 00:32:36,028
l bet l know why they call you Curly Sue.
'Cause you got all that beautiful curly hair.

304
00:32:36,803 --> 00:32:37,633
No.

305
00:32:38,705 --> 00:32:41,970
lt's because this guy we wintered with,
Tampa Joe Reilly...

306
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:44,870
thought l looked like
the big oaf in the Three Stooges.

307
00:32:44,944 --> 00:32:47,469
He said it so much that it stuck. See ya.

308
00:34:08,928 --> 00:34:10,691
How come you don't have any kids?

309
00:34:11,731 --> 00:34:13,961
You have plenty of dough for lots of them.

310
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,431
lt would be hard for me to have children.
l'm not married.

311
00:34:18,238 --> 00:34:20,536
Kids don't come from weddings,
you know.

312
00:34:20,607 --> 00:34:25,010
-They come from right down--
-No. l know.

313
00:34:26,346 --> 00:34:30,112
The proper way to have a family
is to start with a wedding, isn't it?

314
00:34:30,817 --> 00:34:34,583
Well, unless you have a baby first.
l want to have seven babies.

315
00:34:35,021 --> 00:34:39,287
l'm naming them Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday...

316
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,520
Saturday, and Bill. After Bill.

317
00:34:43,396 --> 00:34:46,297
Can l ask you
why you call your father Bill?

318
00:34:50,236 --> 00:34:51,533
Well...

319
00:34:51,871 --> 00:34:55,602
if l'm in a crowded place and l yell...

320
00:34:56,242 --> 00:34:59,370
''Dad! '' 50 guys would turn around.

321
00:34:59,445 --> 00:35:02,676
lf l yell ''Bill! '' maybe two will turn around.

322
00:35:03,249 --> 00:35:04,978
lt's a timesaver, really.

323
00:35:08,821 --> 00:35:10,550
You better get some sleep.

324
00:35:11,691 --> 00:35:12,817
Good night.

325
00:35:12,992 --> 00:35:16,018
Excuse me, where is the guy
you were with yesterday?

326
00:35:16,529 --> 00:35:18,724
-He had to work late.
-ls he a cop?

327
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,328
No. Good night.

328
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:26,065
-Ma'am?
-Yes?

329
00:35:26,372 --> 00:35:28,101
l bet he loves you a lot.

330
00:35:28,641 --> 00:35:30,905
l hope so. Good night.

331
00:35:31,844 --> 00:35:33,539
l know how you can tell.

332
00:35:34,614 --> 00:35:36,605
-How?
-He lets you eat first.

333
00:35:41,621 --> 00:35:42,952
Sweet dreams.

334
00:36:44,017 --> 00:36:46,076
-Hi.
-Hi.

335
00:36:48,154 --> 00:36:50,452
-You okay?
-Yeah, l'm fine.

336
00:36:51,591 --> 00:36:53,957
l mean, l feel like l got hit by a car.

337
00:36:54,961 --> 00:36:56,485
You got hit by a car.

338
00:36:58,464 --> 00:37:00,227
-You okay?
-Yeah.

339
00:37:02,869 --> 00:37:03,961
Come here.

340
00:37:08,374 --> 00:37:10,069
What's the matter, baby?

341
00:37:13,312 --> 00:37:15,940
l've never slept by myself
since l was a baby.

342
00:37:17,917 --> 00:37:21,011
You'll love it.
You don't get kicked so much.

343
00:37:23,489 --> 00:37:25,218
But what if l get scared?

344
00:37:30,163 --> 00:37:33,257
There's no reason to be scared.
Know why?

345
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:36,598
Because when you're alone...

346
00:37:36,936 --> 00:37:38,665
angels come to the window.

347
00:37:39,138 --> 00:37:40,503
You open it up...

348
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:44,535
they float into the room over your bed.
And if you're asleep...

349
00:37:45,611 --> 00:37:47,101
they'll come down...

350
00:37:48,081 --> 00:37:49,776
and kiss your eyelids...

351
00:37:50,249 --> 00:37:54,117
and they give you the sweetest,
most wonderful dreams you'll ever have.

352
00:37:54,987 --> 00:37:57,387
-ls this true?
-Sure, it's true.

353
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:58,582
You sure?

354
00:37:58,658 --> 00:38:00,922
Yeah. Now, come here and give me a hug.

355
00:38:00,993 --> 00:38:01,982
Come on.

356
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,868
-l love you, Bill.
-Oh, baby.

357
00:38:11,537 --> 00:38:13,164
l love you, too, honey.

358
00:38:14,774 --> 00:38:16,833
You know, we're very lucky today.

359
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:19,071
-You go to bed.
-Okay.

360
00:38:20,113 --> 00:38:22,638
-All right? Get some rest.
-Okay.

361
00:38:24,484 --> 00:38:25,473
Go on.

362
00:38:35,862 --> 00:38:38,660
We have now come to the end
of our program day...

363
00:38:38,931 --> 00:38:42,765
and we'll join you tomorrow
at the regular time. Good night.

364
00:39:53,573 --> 00:39:54,665
Play ball.

365
00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:21,591
Shoot, she's mad.

366
00:41:28,868 --> 00:41:31,860
-You're nuts!
-Will you keep your voice down?

367
00:41:31,971 --> 00:41:35,202
Am l hallucinating?
You have two derelicts in your apartment.

368
00:41:35,274 --> 00:41:37,265
-lt's a long story.
-And a weird one...

369
00:41:37,343 --> 00:41:39,971
which l'm stopping
as soon l can focus my eyes.

370
00:41:40,046 --> 00:41:42,571
l'm sorry l hit you. l didn't recognize you.

371
00:41:42,715 --> 00:41:44,706
That speaks well for our relationship.

372
00:41:44,784 --> 00:41:47,981
l was ripped from my sleep
by a screaming child--

373
00:41:48,054 --> 00:41:50,955
That damn urchin
gave me a pop you wouldn't believe.

374
00:41:51,023 --> 00:41:52,490
Knuckle punch, in the nose.

375
00:41:52,558 --> 00:41:54,458
l asked you to keep your voice down!

376
00:41:54,527 --> 00:41:58,019
l told you last night you were itching for it,
buying those two food.

377
00:41:58,097 --> 00:41:59,894
How the hell did they end up here?

378
00:41:59,999 --> 00:42:01,796
l hit him with my car again.

379
00:42:02,768 --> 00:42:04,998
Exactly what time
were you born yesterday?

380
00:42:05,071 --> 00:42:07,096
lt's crazy, but it's true.

381
00:42:07,173 --> 00:42:10,836
Did you ever think that this monkey
is throwing himself in front of your car?

382
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,104
Jig's up, Bill.

383
00:42:12,178 --> 00:42:15,739
You are an educated woman
in a position of responsibility...

384
00:42:15,815 --> 00:42:18,306
in major law firm,
making a tremendous living.

385
00:42:18,384 --> 00:42:19,942
What happened to you?

386
00:42:20,019 --> 00:42:22,487
What caused you
to invite vagabonds into your home?

387
00:42:22,555 --> 00:42:25,922
l'm not stupid!
l had my bedroom door locked.

388
00:42:26,325 --> 00:42:28,350
Oh, then you were perfectly safe.

389
00:42:28,427 --> 00:42:31,419
l didn't sense any danger.
lf l had, l wouldn't have done it.

390
00:42:31,497 --> 00:42:34,523
No danger? l got slugged twice
in five seconds!

391
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,067
That was an accident!

392
00:42:36,135 --> 00:42:39,832
l'm sure when you got into bed
you scared the hell out of Curly Sue.

393
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:44,669
Curly Sue? That's cute!
What is she, the lost Stooge?

394
00:42:45,144 --> 00:42:47,635
l don't know what the hell
is going on here...

395
00:42:47,713 --> 00:42:49,806
and l can't explain so you'd understand.

396
00:42:49,882 --> 00:42:52,612
English, French, Hebrew, Mandarin,
it'd be the same.

397
00:42:52,685 --> 00:42:54,710
You're nuts!

398
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:57,254
And you're abusive and insensitive!

399
00:42:58,824 --> 00:43:01,952
Don't get holy because
you've endangered your life for no reason!

400
00:43:02,061 --> 00:43:03,528
You can let yourself out.

401
00:43:03,596 --> 00:43:07,999
No! l'm not leaving you here alone
with them in the house. No way, babe.

402
00:43:08,634 --> 00:43:10,465
Then sleep on the sofa.

403
00:43:10,903 --> 00:43:12,666
The guest rooms are taken!

404
00:44:52,972 --> 00:44:53,870
Hi.

405
00:45:02,615 --> 00:45:03,582
Anise?

406
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:09,680
Could you call my housekeeper and tell
her l have guests, so she's not alarmed?

407
00:45:09,755 --> 00:45:12,656
All right, just to make this fair...

408
00:45:13,325 --> 00:45:15,520
to make sure there's no suspicion...

409
00:45:16,962 --> 00:45:19,487
l'm going to allow the little lady to deal.

410
00:45:20,533 --> 00:45:21,522
Okay?

411
00:45:24,103 --> 00:45:25,900
-Okay.
-Deal, honey.

412
00:45:26,405 --> 00:45:27,770
That seems fair.

413
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:32,975
Shuffle them up.

414
00:45:45,558 --> 00:45:47,025
She's gotten better.

415
00:45:55,968 --> 00:45:58,232
Okay. Why don't you deal?

416
00:46:14,086 --> 00:46:16,919
-l'm going to raise $10.
-$10, okay.

417
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:20,622
l'll stay, you've taken half my paycheck.

418
00:46:20,693 --> 00:46:23,059
But if you win, l'll work for you for a week.

419
00:46:23,395 --> 00:46:25,124
Crybabies never win, lady.

420
00:46:25,397 --> 00:46:27,422
Shut up. You can barely see over the table.

421
00:46:27,499 --> 00:46:31,993
l may not be able to see over the table,
but l have the other half of your paycheck.

422
00:46:32,571 --> 00:46:34,334
-Bill?
-lt's the missus!

423
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,974
Trina?

424
00:46:37,176 --> 00:46:40,009
Trina, l'm home!

425
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,670
What is going on?

426
00:46:44,049 --> 00:46:45,607
Open the door, please!

427
00:46:52,191 --> 00:46:53,783
Open the door!

428
00:46:58,998 --> 00:47:00,693
Why was the door locked?

429
00:47:02,067 --> 00:47:04,501
-The child must have done it.
-Yeah.

430
00:47:06,005 --> 00:47:08,701
-How's the gentleman?
-He's really sick.

431
00:47:08,974 --> 00:47:12,410
Yeah, he's really....
l only saw him for a second this morning.

432
00:47:12,478 --> 00:47:14,946
And, l went in there, and he was just....

433
00:47:16,015 --> 00:47:19,382
God, he's all sweating and everything.

434
00:47:19,685 --> 00:47:22,848
l just kept running by there today.
l wouldn't even go in.

435
00:47:22,921 --> 00:47:26,857
l'd just run by, and he'd be groaning
and making all sorts of noises....

436
00:47:28,127 --> 00:47:29,719
Kind of freaks me out.

437
00:47:30,629 --> 00:47:32,426
-Do you smoke cigars?
-Yeah.

438
00:47:33,632 --> 00:47:36,965
-l wish you wouldn't in my home.
-Yeah. l understand that.

439
00:47:37,036 --> 00:47:40,130
That's reasonable.
See, l don't usually smoke cigars.

440
00:47:40,205 --> 00:47:41,968
lt's just that my friend had a baby.

441
00:47:44,643 --> 00:47:47,635
Your dad sure ate a lot
for someone who doesn't feel well.

442
00:47:47,713 --> 00:47:50,511
Well, he's like a camel with a hump.

443
00:47:50,916 --> 00:47:53,851
You know how camels
keep food and water in their humps?

444
00:47:53,919 --> 00:47:55,750
Only his hump is his stomach.

445
00:47:55,821 --> 00:47:59,120
l'm sure he feels awful, but
when you've a chance to load the hump...

446
00:47:59,191 --> 00:48:01,659
you load the hump. That's our philosophy.

447
00:48:03,062 --> 00:48:04,859
You're a smart little girl.

448
00:48:05,264 --> 00:48:07,528
l'm very smart. l know a lot of stuff.

449
00:48:10,135 --> 00:48:11,830
Do you know how to read?

450
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:15,804
Sure.

451
00:48:16,475 --> 00:48:19,706
l can also do math
and spell extremely large words.

452
00:48:20,245 --> 00:48:21,644
Like ''asphyxiate?''

453
00:48:23,682 --> 00:48:27,982
-Yeah. A-S-P-H-Y-x--
-Try a small one.

454
00:48:32,458 --> 00:48:33,550
Excuse me?

455
00:48:34,393 --> 00:48:35,621
Spell ''cat.''

456
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,828
l will later.

457
00:48:46,338 --> 00:48:47,828
How about right now?

458
00:48:51,677 --> 00:48:52,769
l can't.

459
00:48:58,117 --> 00:48:59,516
Just as l thought.

460
00:49:20,839 --> 00:49:22,466
-Hi.
-What's going on?

461
00:49:23,642 --> 00:49:26,076
-l'm recuperating--
-Knock it off!

462
00:49:26,712 --> 00:49:30,079
-What are you doing with that little girl?
-What do you mean?

463
00:49:30,582 --> 00:49:32,413
Has she ever been to school?

464
00:49:33,218 --> 00:49:36,847
-Briefly, from time to time.
-She's completely ignorant.

465
00:49:37,089 --> 00:49:38,249
She's not ignorant.

466
00:49:38,323 --> 00:49:40,689
-She's illiterate.
-That's not ignorant.

467
00:49:41,527 --> 00:49:43,427
You're using her, aren't you?

468
00:49:43,796 --> 00:49:45,388
-No, ma'am.
-Liar.

469
00:49:45,597 --> 00:49:48,964
You use her in your little cons.
lt's pathetic. lt's criminal.

470
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,801
l guess it's time to go.

471
00:49:56,875 --> 00:49:58,900
Go ahead. You're not taking her.

472
00:49:59,845 --> 00:50:02,313
-You're going to stop me?
-The police will.

473
00:50:02,381 --> 00:50:04,110
You're going to call the police?

474
00:50:04,183 --> 00:50:08,347
You're not taking her out of here.
You're leaving, and she's staying.

475
00:50:08,454 --> 00:50:11,582
-You don't know a thing about this.
-l know neglect when l see it.

476
00:50:11,657 --> 00:50:13,989
-She's not neglected.
-She's abused.

477
00:50:14,393 --> 00:50:18,329
-l am very serious, Mr. Dancer.
-Kiss my ass, lady.

478
00:50:18,964 --> 00:50:21,057
l've raised that kid from a baby.

479
00:50:21,767 --> 00:50:24,964
We've beat worse things
than some do-good, high-rise legal eagle...

480
00:50:25,037 --> 00:50:27,665
with a jones for arms-length social reform.

481
00:50:28,073 --> 00:50:31,531
Now step aside, before l throw
your pampered ass in the closet.

482
00:50:32,611 --> 00:50:34,078
You don't scare me.

483
00:50:35,881 --> 00:50:38,179
l've got nothing to lose but that kid.

484
00:50:38,417 --> 00:50:42,513
You try taking that kid away from me,
l'm going to knock your damn head off.

485
00:50:46,592 --> 00:50:47,991
lf you love her...

486
00:50:48,861 --> 00:50:50,328
give her a chance.

487
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:00,535
Okay. How?

488
00:51:03,408 --> 00:51:06,343
Does the state of lllinois
know what's right for her?

489
00:51:06,411 --> 00:51:09,676
Sure, they'll teach her how to read,
and how to be a freak.

490
00:51:09,781 --> 00:51:13,342
And when people bitch about welfare,
they'll be bitching about her.

491
00:51:13,418 --> 00:51:16,854
Bill, you can't feed her.
You can't clothe her.

492
00:51:17,055 --> 00:51:19,216
How do you know
she won't freeze to death...

493
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:21,282
or get beat up or kidnapped?

494
00:51:21,426 --> 00:51:25,294
What if something happens to you,
and she ends up in the middle of nowhere?

495
00:51:25,364 --> 00:51:28,390
l get by. l survive.
l've been doing it her whole life.

496
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:42,146
Where's her mother?

497
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,815
She's buried in Florida.

498
00:51:50,122 --> 00:51:52,488
You want to know the rest of the story?

499
00:51:54,293 --> 00:51:55,760
l'm not her father.

500
00:51:56,929 --> 00:51:59,124
l met her mother one night in a bar.

501
00:51:59,731 --> 00:52:02,962
Some people get VD
from a one-night stand, l got a baby.

502
00:52:04,536 --> 00:52:07,096
She knows all about it.
We've got no secrets.

503
00:52:09,641 --> 00:52:11,836
lf there was another life for her...

504
00:52:11,977 --> 00:52:14,172
l'd cut my throat to give it to her.

505
00:52:16,148 --> 00:52:18,548
l didn't come in here to ruin your life.

506
00:52:19,284 --> 00:52:21,912
Our paths crossed, and you ended up here.

507
00:52:23,488 --> 00:52:24,716
You're right.

508
00:52:27,693 --> 00:52:31,254
You got scammed. l got a knock
on the head, and the rest is bull.

509
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:34,392
l've got a lot of tricks.
l've been at it a long time.

510
00:52:34,466 --> 00:52:36,730
You play something until it's over...

511
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:39,735
and this is over.

512
00:52:46,111 --> 00:52:47,169
No tears.

513
00:53:06,565 --> 00:53:07,930
l must be crazy.

514
00:53:21,613 --> 00:53:23,342
Stay as long as you like.

515
00:53:24,182 --> 00:53:25,274
l'm sorry.

516
00:53:49,408 --> 00:53:51,035
You better go to sleep.

517
00:53:52,411 --> 00:53:55,938
-Did Bill give me to you?
-No.

518
00:53:57,649 --> 00:53:59,742
He's always looking for somebody.

519
00:54:03,355 --> 00:54:07,348
A father always looks
for the best life he can give his child.

520
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,521
There's nothing wrong with my life.

521
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:13,397
l didn't mean that.

522
00:54:15,133 --> 00:54:19,570
lt's just that as you grow up and become
a young lady, there are going to be...

523
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:22,529
things...

524
00:54:23,275 --> 00:54:25,743
and situations that will be...

525
00:54:26,278 --> 00:54:28,473
difficult for a man.

526
00:54:28,914 --> 00:54:31,883
All the stuff that happens to women,
l already know.

527
00:54:32,084 --> 00:54:34,814
The boobs, the kissing,
the babies, the crabby time...

528
00:54:34,886 --> 00:54:37,116
the not wearing lipstick till you're 16...

529
00:54:37,189 --> 00:54:40,022
the underwear bank robbers wear
on their faces....

530
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,355
-There's a little more to it than that.
-Half of it, l don't care for.

531
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:48,365
Pink dresses, kittens,
spending time in your bathroom...

532
00:54:48,433 --> 00:54:50,367
crying when something's real cute....

533
00:54:50,435 --> 00:54:52,699
Frankly, that makes me lose my belly.

534
00:54:53,872 --> 00:54:54,861
Well....

535
00:54:56,007 --> 00:55:00,034
You're a very smart little girl
who knows herself very well.

536
00:55:01,513 --> 00:55:06,473
But, l promise you, there will be times
when you'll wish for a woman to talk to.

537
00:55:06,752 --> 00:55:09,152
-l doubt it.
-Okay.

538
00:55:12,524 --> 00:55:14,651
Well, we talked about it...

539
00:55:15,127 --> 00:55:16,822
and you can think about it.

540
00:55:16,895 --> 00:55:19,762
And if you feel you have
the need to discuss it....

541
00:55:20,031 --> 00:55:21,896
Bill will take care of it.

542
00:55:24,436 --> 00:55:26,028
Better get some sleep.

543
00:55:43,021 --> 00:55:44,147
Good night.

544
00:55:46,558 --> 00:55:48,856
Do you mind if l watch TV for a while?

545
00:55:49,928 --> 00:55:51,395
For a little while.

546
00:56:19,324 --> 00:56:21,918
-Did you see Bill this morning?
-Nope.

547
00:56:24,095 --> 00:56:27,030
-What time did you get up?
-lt was still dark.

548
00:56:27,632 --> 00:56:28,860
What's wrong?

549
00:56:30,468 --> 00:56:31,560
He's gone.

550
00:56:33,638 --> 00:56:36,368
-Did he leave a note?
-No.

551
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:39,935
Did he leave a ring? A little one?

552
00:56:40,779 --> 00:56:43,441
-No.
-Then he'll be back.

553
00:57:22,487 --> 00:57:25,115
l hope you know
you're making me miss Flipper.

554
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:28,721
You've got to work. lf you don't go
to school, you have to work.

555
00:57:28,793 --> 00:57:31,626
Everybody's got to do something
when they get big.

556
00:57:31,963 --> 00:57:33,931
l'm not going to be a bathtub washer.

557
00:57:33,999 --> 00:57:36,490
Really? What are you going to be, then?

558
00:57:36,768 --> 00:57:38,065
Maybe a lawyer.

559
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:41,871
You know how long
you have to go to school to be a lawyer?

560
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:44,374
-How long?
-Twenty years.

561
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,714
Slap my butt, no way.

562
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:53,977
Do you want to save your marriage?

563
00:57:54,819 --> 00:57:58,448
What about the pictures
and the tape recordings?

564
00:57:59,691 --> 00:58:04,025
lt's terrible, it's disgusting,
but before we go on, l need to know:

565
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:06,759
Do you want to leave him?

566
00:58:10,368 --> 00:58:11,960
That's what l thought.

567
00:58:12,704 --> 00:58:14,228
Let's work on that.

568
00:58:15,874 --> 00:58:17,273
Are you all right?

569
00:58:17,642 --> 00:58:21,373
You seem a little nice.

570
00:58:27,185 --> 00:58:28,174
Thanks.

571
00:58:33,525 --> 00:58:36,289
-How was your day?
-Total pisser.

572
00:58:37,495 --> 00:58:41,431
l'm too tired to lecture you
about using that kind of language.

573
00:58:42,334 --> 00:58:44,199
Sorry. lt slipped out.

574
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:47,301
-Did Bill call?
-Nope.

575
00:58:48,606 --> 00:58:50,733
Shouldn't he be home by now?

576
00:58:56,314 --> 00:58:57,508
Hello?

577
00:59:00,318 --> 00:59:01,376
Hi.

578
00:59:02,787 --> 00:59:04,152
Guess what?

579
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:07,323
l got a job.

580
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:10,258
Great!

581
00:59:10,328 --> 00:59:13,195
Yeah. lt's not a great job, but it's work.

582
00:59:13,365 --> 00:59:15,833
l get my first paycheck in a week.

583
00:59:16,868 --> 00:59:19,393
l haven't done that in a long time.

584
00:59:22,073 --> 00:59:24,701
-l'm very proud of you.
-Yeah?

585
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:29,744
lt's no big deal, really.
lt just feels better to be working.

586
00:59:29,948 --> 00:59:31,108
l know.

587
00:59:33,651 --> 00:59:35,710
-What's your problem?
-You.

588
00:59:39,624 --> 00:59:42,218
She doesn't take to change very well.

589
00:59:42,961 --> 00:59:44,519
She'll be all right.

590
00:59:51,803 --> 00:59:54,135
-May l help you?
-May l help you?

591
00:59:54,873 --> 00:59:56,272
May we help you?

592
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:40,807
l feel like an idiot.

593
01:01:40,879 --> 01:01:42,710
You look very pretty.

594
01:01:45,016 --> 01:01:46,540
Very, very....

595
01:01:54,526 --> 01:01:56,858
Where are the shoes l gave you?

596
01:02:00,598 --> 01:02:02,395
She's got nice hair.

597
01:02:04,269 --> 01:02:05,463
These?

598
01:02:07,505 --> 01:02:10,941
These tights itch. Pants. What are these?

599
01:02:13,011 --> 01:02:15,571
These things stick to your butt.

600
01:02:30,595 --> 01:02:31,721
Bill?

601
01:02:33,064 --> 01:02:34,998
ls everything all right?

602
01:02:35,066 --> 01:02:37,193
l feel like a goddamn fool.

603
01:02:40,004 --> 01:02:41,835
Can it be that bad?

604
01:02:57,622 --> 01:02:59,112
You look great!

605
01:03:00,091 --> 01:03:01,217
Think so?

606
01:03:06,497 --> 01:03:08,488
You've got a tag on you.

607
01:03:21,145 --> 01:03:22,806
You don't need it.

608
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:26,577
l need it for Sue. She gets a runny nose.

609
01:03:28,052 --> 01:03:31,078
-You look really pretty.
-Thank you.

610
01:03:31,155 --> 01:03:32,679
So, you hungry?

611
01:03:33,124 --> 01:03:34,751
Yeah. Let's eat.

612
01:03:35,059 --> 01:03:36,458
l hate this.

613
01:03:56,581 --> 01:03:58,674
Good evening.

614
01:04:05,657 --> 01:04:07,056
Kiss, kiss.

615
01:04:10,428 --> 01:04:14,159
These are my friends.
William Dancer and his daughter Susan.

616
01:04:18,136 --> 01:04:20,604
What a lovely little girl you are.

617
01:04:21,205 --> 01:04:23,332
-May l?
-May you what?

618
01:04:24,375 --> 01:04:26,002
Kiss your cheek.

619
01:04:26,311 --> 01:04:27,869
ln a pig's eye.

620
01:04:31,816 --> 01:04:33,374
ln a pig's eye.

621
01:04:36,054 --> 01:04:38,045
-Good evening.
-We've met.

622
01:04:38,389 --> 01:04:42,553
Yes. Bill Dancer, Chairman of the Board,
First lllinois State Bank.

623
01:04:42,627 --> 01:04:44,094
Very powerful man.

624
01:04:44,162 --> 01:04:45,390
-No.
-No?

625
01:04:45,463 --> 01:04:49,160
City Ordinance.
Title 2, Chapter 160, Section 010.

626
01:04:49,233 --> 01:04:50,666
Ring a bell?

627
01:04:55,073 --> 01:04:56,540
My God!

628
01:04:56,607 --> 01:04:58,097
Take my coat.

629
01:04:58,843 --> 01:05:03,473
This was a joke, yes? lt was a joke?
A little funny, no?

630
01:05:03,548 --> 01:05:05,106
Hang our coats.

631
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:09,186
To be entirely honest with you,
you smelled quite bad.

632
01:05:10,788 --> 01:05:14,781
You see, the other day,
there wasn't all that many options for--

633
01:05:15,126 --> 01:05:17,356
Your table is right this way.

634
01:06:01,139 --> 01:06:05,405
When you suggested dinner
l didn't realize you were bringing the kids.

635
01:06:05,977 --> 01:06:08,605
l thought it would be a nice surprise.

636
01:06:08,679 --> 01:06:10,613
You succeeded mightily.

637
01:06:13,351 --> 01:06:15,148
You remember Walker.

638
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,385
Yes. Good evening.

639
01:06:17,889 --> 01:06:21,757
You'll pardon my incredulity.
l presumed you'd be gone by now.

640
01:06:23,961 --> 01:06:25,189
l'm not.

641
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:29,722
You look like you got hit by a razor
and a bar of soap.

642
01:06:29,901 --> 01:06:32,369
-Scotch and soda?
-Right away, sir.

643
01:06:35,206 --> 01:06:37,868
Where did you get the spiffy new duds?

644
01:06:38,142 --> 01:06:39,404
From me.

645
01:06:44,782 --> 01:06:47,580
Boy, you two have hit the jackpot.

646
01:06:51,756 --> 01:06:53,314
How's the grub?

647
01:06:55,993 --> 01:06:58,655
You were late, and Susan got hungry.

648
01:07:01,999 --> 01:07:04,194
So we went ahead and ordered.

649
01:07:09,006 --> 01:07:11,236
l'm suddenly not very hungry.

650
01:07:12,877 --> 01:07:15,471
What did you order? Beans?

651
01:07:18,082 --> 01:07:20,107
Let's call it an evening.

652
01:07:20,184 --> 01:07:22,414
-No, it's fine.
-No, it's not.

653
01:07:23,721 --> 01:07:27,179
l'm not going to eat this,
l'm not going to take that.

654
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:29,087
Come on, Sue.

655
01:07:31,662 --> 01:07:33,562
This time, keep going.

656
01:07:35,333 --> 01:07:36,630
Sit down.

657
01:07:37,535 --> 01:07:39,696
You had no right to do that.

658
01:07:41,239 --> 01:07:43,366
Told you this was a bad idea.

659
01:07:43,441 --> 01:07:46,376
lt's no fun being somebody's toys.
That's what we are.

660
01:07:46,444 --> 01:07:49,311
-l'm ashamed of us.
-Don't ever say that.

661
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:51,348
Excuse me, but l am.

662
01:07:51,415 --> 01:07:53,406
Tell me what's going on?

663
01:07:53,518 --> 01:07:56,885
l don't see you for a few days
and you're playing dress-up.

664
01:07:56,954 --> 01:08:00,390
You're serious about this?
How did you get to be a lawyer?

665
01:08:00,491 --> 01:08:04,518
You send in a couple of bucks
and a label from a box of Frosted Flakes?

666
01:08:06,197 --> 01:08:07,596
Good night!

667
01:08:24,582 --> 01:08:25,674
Bill!

668
01:08:40,865 --> 01:08:42,389
Bill, come on.

669
01:08:43,301 --> 01:08:44,563
Hush up.

670
01:08:46,904 --> 01:08:48,394
l'm so sorry.

671
01:08:48,773 --> 01:08:49,899
Good.

672
01:08:51,208 --> 01:08:53,176
lt won't do us any good.

673
01:08:53,244 --> 01:08:55,508
lt's too late. We're offended.

674
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:57,810
Just knock it off, all right?

675
01:08:58,182 --> 01:09:01,276
Walker's an ass.
lf you took anything he said to heart...

676
01:09:01,352 --> 01:09:04,014
you're just as big an ass as he is.

677
01:09:04,221 --> 01:09:08,055
This thing's a joke, you know that?
The whole thing's a joke.

678
01:09:08,125 --> 01:09:12,084
The coat, the gloves, everything.
lt's not doing any of us any good.

679
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:15,098
Get it? Do you see what l'm saying?

680
01:09:15,199 --> 01:09:17,827
Bill, where are you going to go?

681
01:09:18,402 --> 01:09:20,734
l'm going to go. We'll be fine.

682
01:09:20,805 --> 01:09:24,639
We've never had a problem
finding a place to stay, all right?

683
01:09:25,776 --> 01:09:29,177
Go back there. We'll go this way.
We'll be just fine.

684
01:09:35,119 --> 01:09:37,144
l don't want you to leave.

685
01:09:39,790 --> 01:09:41,849
l'll tell you one thing...

686
01:09:41,926 --> 01:09:45,225
we're not going back
into that stuck-up hash house.

687
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:50,196
Me, either. Let's go somewhere else.
Anywhere. Your choice.

688
01:09:55,673 --> 01:09:58,141
How about if we take you out?

689
01:10:00,344 --> 01:10:02,676
Bill, you don't have any money.

690
01:10:03,114 --> 01:10:04,911
We don't need money.

691
01:10:05,349 --> 01:10:07,476
lt never stopped us before.

692
01:10:08,986 --> 01:10:10,544
-Okay.
-Come on.

693
01:10:30,641 --> 01:10:33,166
A toast to Tiffany and Adam.

694
01:10:34,612 --> 01:10:37,706
Health, wealth, and happiness.

695
01:10:53,931 --> 01:10:56,263
Thank you. Thank you very much.

696
01:10:57,501 --> 01:10:59,935
lt's okay. He does it all the time.

697
01:11:00,004 --> 01:11:01,835
l'd like to make a toast...

698
01:11:01,906 --> 01:11:03,168
He's a pro.

699
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:06,767
...to the bride and groom,
Tiffany and Adam.

700
01:11:09,213 --> 01:11:11,943
May you always have a passion for life.

701
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:15,216
And may your life be filled with passion.

702
01:11:17,621 --> 01:11:21,022
Now my wife Doris would like
to say something. Doris?

703
01:11:22,693 --> 01:11:25,856
Would you like to say
a few words to the bride and groom?

704
01:11:26,363 --> 01:11:28,024
l couldn't.

705
01:11:29,233 --> 01:11:31,428
For Adam and Tiffany, please.

706
01:11:31,502 --> 01:11:35,495
She has a few things to say.
Come on, stand up and say something.

707
01:11:43,547 --> 01:11:47,142
First of all, it's just so good to be here.
You know, it's just...

708
01:11:47,685 --> 01:11:49,710
such a great event.

709
01:11:50,254 --> 01:11:51,448
And...

710
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:56,082
l can hardly remember
the last time l saw little Tiffany...

711
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:59,755
when she was just that big.
But now she's....

712
01:11:59,830 --> 01:12:01,764
About here?

713
01:12:01,832 --> 01:12:04,892
l guess it was at...

714
01:12:04,969 --> 01:12:06,960
our wedding in Vegas.

715
01:12:07,938 --> 01:12:10,668
lt was a beautiful wedding,
but nothing like this.

716
01:12:10,741 --> 01:12:12,641
-No.
-Oh, boy.

717
01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:14,803
-Very well-put.
-Thank you.

718
01:12:14,879 --> 01:12:16,403
-Salute!
-Salute!

719
01:12:27,091 --> 01:12:29,059
Hi. Cold out there, huh?

720
01:12:29,126 --> 01:12:30,388
Oh, boy.

721
01:12:31,395 --> 01:12:33,090
Okay. Tickets, sir?

722
01:12:33,164 --> 01:12:35,530
l had them. Didn't l have them?

723
01:12:35,599 --> 01:12:38,796
You're holding up the line here.
Why don't you step to the side?

724
01:12:38,869 --> 01:12:41,531
-No, l got them.
-Maybe you dropped them.

725
01:12:41,605 --> 01:12:43,402
Excuse me. l'm sorry.

726
01:12:44,375 --> 01:12:47,776
-Did l give you the tickets?
-No, you didn't give them to me.

727
01:12:48,646 --> 01:12:51,581
Sorry, maybe we dropped them outside.

728
01:12:52,516 --> 01:12:54,108
What should we do?

729
01:12:54,185 --> 01:12:57,120
Go to the box office, sir.
They can help you out.

730
01:12:57,688 --> 01:12:59,713
Go by the box office, okay?

731
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:01,280
There we are.

732
01:14:27,077 --> 01:14:28,169
What?

733
01:14:28,279 --> 01:14:30,474
Where'd you get the popcorn?

734
01:14:35,552 --> 01:14:36,814
Thirsty?

735
01:14:59,843 --> 01:15:01,276
-Grey?
-Thanks.

736
01:15:17,795 --> 01:15:19,023
Thanks.

737
01:15:47,524 --> 01:15:49,014
This is great!

738
01:16:38,776 --> 01:16:40,107
Come here.

739
01:18:39,229 --> 01:18:40,321
Chicago.

740
01:18:41,865 --> 01:18:44,527
Department of Children
and Family Services.

741
01:18:46,904 --> 01:18:48,735
Abuse and Neglect.

742
01:19:49,666 --> 01:19:51,793
-Grey!
-Good morning.

743
01:19:52,970 --> 01:19:56,098
Bernie, what a pleasant surprise.
Did we have a meeting?

744
01:19:56,373 --> 01:19:59,774
l've stopped trying to fix meetings, Grey.
You're never in.

745
01:19:59,843 --> 01:20:03,301
That's not true.
Obviously something is bothering you.

746
01:20:03,981 --> 01:20:05,676
What are you doing?

747
01:20:05,749 --> 01:20:09,310
Every time l've called the last few days,
you're not in.

748
01:20:09,486 --> 01:20:12,250
l've had personal business to attend to.

749
01:20:12,422 --> 01:20:14,720
l don't know if personal business...

750
01:20:14,791 --> 01:20:18,158
or the time it's taken from work
has anything to do with it...

751
01:20:18,228 --> 01:20:21,197
but you've got this Arnold divorce
all screwed up.

752
01:20:21,698 --> 01:20:24,394
Nothing's screwed up.
l told her to return to her husband.

753
01:20:24,468 --> 01:20:26,368
-She did.
-What's the problem?

754
01:20:26,436 --> 01:20:29,735
He wanted her out.
That's why l told you to go easy.

755
01:20:29,806 --> 01:20:32,639
He wanted out,
but not to give up everything.

756
01:20:34,177 --> 01:20:36,338
l guess it's his tough luck.

757
01:20:36,513 --> 01:20:40,142
Do you have photographs of Frank Arnold?

758
01:20:40,717 --> 01:20:42,617
-l'll say.
-Destroy them.

759
01:20:42,953 --> 01:20:44,011
No.

760
01:20:44,354 --> 01:20:48,188
Not if he's going to screw her
out of what she's entitled to.

761
01:20:48,525 --> 01:20:51,050
Destroy them. No opposition on this.

762
01:20:52,162 --> 01:20:54,926
He wants the grounds. He wants the kids.

763
01:20:56,066 --> 01:20:59,297
And try spending a little more time
in the office.

764
01:21:55,292 --> 01:21:57,123
Are you Susan Dancer?

765
01:22:15,946 --> 01:22:17,436
Hiya, pigeon.

766
01:22:19,182 --> 01:22:21,013
You're looking sharp.

767
01:23:34,090 --> 01:23:36,058
l can't talk.

768
01:23:36,426 --> 01:23:38,087
Where's the ring?

769
01:23:40,063 --> 01:23:42,122
Tell me where the ring is.

770
01:23:42,466 --> 01:23:44,900
l pawned it. Ogden and Madison.

771
01:23:52,642 --> 01:23:56,100
This situation is totally unnecessary.
l'm an attorney.

772
01:23:56,179 --> 01:23:58,739
The child was in my care, in my home.

773
01:23:58,815 --> 01:24:02,751
Her needs were being met.
There was no reason to take her away.

774
01:24:03,086 --> 01:24:05,680
Ma'am, you aren't a legal guardian.

775
01:24:05,755 --> 01:24:08,781
She can't possibly understand
what's happening to her.

776
01:24:08,859 --> 01:24:12,625
She's in protective custody.
She's being properly cared for.

777
01:24:13,964 --> 01:24:17,331
ln 48 hours, a shelter-care hearing
will be called in juvenile court.

778
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:19,391
You're welcome to attend.

779
01:24:24,774 --> 01:24:26,765
l love this little girl.

780
01:24:28,945 --> 01:24:31,072
lt's understandable, but...

781
01:24:31,281 --> 01:24:34,307
from my position,
it's completely irrelevant.

782
01:24:42,459 --> 01:24:45,656
Yo, Dancer. You're out of here.

783
01:24:46,863 --> 01:24:49,491
Your lawyer just posted bond for you.

784
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:52,027
You got a cute lawyer, too.

785
01:25:18,995 --> 01:25:21,759
Did you ever get those
plantar's warts taken care of?.

786
01:25:21,831 --> 01:25:24,026
My aunt Bernice had hers cut out.

787
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:26,694
-Frank Arnold?
-Pumpkin, l'm on the phone.

788
01:25:26,770 --> 01:25:30,297
You know, they're so sensitive.
Aunt Bernice had those.

789
01:25:30,373 --> 01:25:33,740
The schnauzer stepped on her,
l thought she'd go through the ceiling.

790
01:25:33,810 --> 01:25:36,005
ls he in? Yes or no?

791
01:25:36,079 --> 01:25:39,708
Have a seat, let me finish my call,
and then l'll tell you.

792
01:25:39,783 --> 01:25:41,978
Try those air-pillow insoles.

793
01:25:42,052 --> 01:25:45,488
Maybe the water kind. Put them
in the fridge and freeze your foot.

794
01:25:45,589 --> 01:25:47,022
l need to see him.

795
01:25:47,090 --> 01:25:49,888
What a pity.
He has a meeting in five minutes.

796
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:52,451
l'm sorry. He has a meeting right now.

797
01:25:52,529 --> 01:25:54,053
l'll call you right back.

798
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:56,792
lf you want to do business with the city--

799
01:25:56,866 --> 01:25:58,197
Missy!

800
01:25:58,268 --> 01:25:59,792
What the hell?

801
01:26:00,203 --> 01:26:02,899
l'm Grey Ellison, your wife's attorney.

802
01:26:03,206 --> 01:26:05,003
l'll get back to you.

803
01:26:05,075 --> 01:26:07,976
Who do you think you are,
busting in here like this.

804
01:26:08,044 --> 01:26:10,842
-l'm in a hurry.
-Lady, so am l.

805
01:26:10,914 --> 01:26:13,474
Your wife loves you. She wants you back.

806
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:15,575
Other sources say
you don't want her back.

807
01:26:15,652 --> 01:26:18,883
l'd like you to work it out,
and l'd like a favor from you.

808
01:26:18,989 --> 01:26:20,479
Are you nuts?

809
01:26:20,690 --> 01:26:23,557
l got a list of names
and some pretty racy photos...

810
01:26:23,627 --> 01:26:26,391
of a certain city official in a blue Speedo.

811
01:26:37,007 --> 01:26:38,838
l don't want to be a bitch...

812
01:26:38,908 --> 01:26:42,469
but l have a problem,
and l need some strings pulled.

813
01:26:48,652 --> 01:26:51,746
You never destroyed
those photographs, did you?

814
01:26:51,821 --> 01:26:56,121
You took them to Frank Arnold
so he could pull strings at the D.C.F.S.

815
01:26:58,895 --> 01:27:02,262
You learned a few tricks
from the old master, didn't you?

816
01:27:02,332 --> 01:27:04,698
Bernie, l want you to buy me out.

817
01:27:05,468 --> 01:27:08,028
You realize how many people would...

818
01:27:08,104 --> 01:27:11,870
kill for what you've achieved
in such a short amount of time?

819
01:27:11,941 --> 01:27:15,707
You got a partnership,
a corner office big enough for basketball.

820
01:27:15,812 --> 01:27:18,406
What are you giving it up for? Love?

821
01:27:20,717 --> 01:27:24,813
You got your value system
all screwed up somewhere along the line.

822
01:27:29,159 --> 01:27:31,593
l think it was screwed up before.

823
01:27:35,765 --> 01:27:37,460
l got to admit...

824
01:27:37,934 --> 01:27:42,030
you're the last one l ever thought
would go quality-of-life on me.

825
01:28:06,029 --> 01:28:07,326
Honey....

826
01:28:07,630 --> 01:28:09,860
Grey, l think you owe me an explanation.

827
01:28:09,933 --> 01:28:11,958
l don't owe you anything!

828
01:28:12,569 --> 01:28:14,901
Four years together
doesn't mean anything?

829
01:28:14,971 --> 01:28:18,668
At least, after the way you've behaved,
you owe me an apology.

830
01:28:19,375 --> 01:28:21,707
Did you turn in my friend
and his daughter?

831
01:28:21,778 --> 01:28:23,541
What makes you think that?

832
01:28:23,613 --> 01:28:24,875
Did you?

833
01:28:25,648 --> 01:28:28,708
There's nothing to hide,
it's a concerned phone call.

834
01:28:28,785 --> 01:28:30,719
Yes or no?

835
01:28:31,221 --> 01:28:33,314
What difference does it make?

836
01:28:33,389 --> 01:28:35,550
-Just answer me!
-Yes.

837
01:28:37,827 --> 01:28:39,317
l thought so.

838
01:28:41,131 --> 01:28:42,655
Grey....

839
01:28:43,333 --> 01:28:44,630
up yours!

840
01:28:48,071 --> 01:28:50,005
Grey? Grey!

841
01:28:50,573 --> 01:28:52,939
Wait, Grey! Stop the car.

842
01:29:24,374 --> 01:29:25,841
There it is.

843
01:29:26,643 --> 01:29:27,735
That's it.

844
01:29:54,571 --> 01:29:56,471
They cut my hair.

845
01:30:48,057 --> 01:30:50,582
-Let's get out of here, okay?
-Okay.

846
01:31:29,232 --> 01:31:31,097
Am l out of this jam for good?

847
01:31:31,167 --> 01:31:34,159
Almost. They have to run
a check on your family.

848
01:31:34,237 --> 01:31:36,467
That's easy. There isn't any.

849
01:31:37,607 --> 01:31:41,907
Then they'll run a check on me,
and if everything...

850
01:31:41,978 --> 01:31:44,947
meets with their approval,
l'll get temporary custody.

851
01:31:45,014 --> 01:31:49,280
And then, with your permission,
we'll start the adoption proceedings.

852
01:31:49,919 --> 01:31:51,546
What does Bill say?

853
01:31:51,821 --> 01:31:54,688
He can't adopt you, honey.
Not now, anyway.

854
01:31:55,058 --> 01:31:56,992
Because he's shiftless.

855
01:31:57,794 --> 01:32:00,957
lt's more complicated than that.
Anyway, it doesn't matter...

856
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:03,965
because l'll have you and he'll be with me.

857
01:32:06,002 --> 01:32:08,527
-Why didn't he come with you?
-He had to work.

858
01:32:08,604 --> 01:32:10,595
You know that for sure?

859
01:32:10,673 --> 01:32:13,233
That's what he said. Why?

860
01:32:13,977 --> 01:32:17,003
You don't have to be a genius
to figure it out.

861
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:21,107
He got me a mother, didn't he?
He can leave anytime he wants now.

862
01:32:57,053 --> 01:32:58,179
Bill?

863
01:34:23,072 --> 01:34:24,630
l can't read it.

864
01:34:33,549 --> 01:34:34,675
lt says:

865
01:34:39,188 --> 01:34:41,213
''l'm in the living room.''

866
01:35:22,031 --> 01:35:23,089
Hi.

867
01:35:34,810 --> 01:35:36,175
Come here.

868
01:36:47,483 --> 01:36:49,678
Look. No swearing...

869
01:36:49,752 --> 01:36:53,188
no gambling, no spitting, no punching,
and no kicking.

870
01:36:53,256 --> 01:36:55,884
Put a sock in it. l know what l'm doing.

871
01:36:55,958 --> 01:36:57,687
Want us to walk you in?

872
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:00,320
No, l got it, but thanks for asking.

873
01:37:01,464 --> 01:37:03,523
All right, give us a kiss.

874
01:37:04,834 --> 01:37:06,825
Please. We're in public.

875
01:37:15,411 --> 01:37:16,776
Good luck.
