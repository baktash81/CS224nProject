1
00:01:13,464 --> 00:01:17,503
I always worry that maybe people aren't
gonna like me when I go to a party.

2
00:01:17,664 --> 00:01:19,859
Isn't that crazy?

3
00:01:20,704 --> 00:01:26,142
Do you ever get kind of a sick feeling in
your stomach when you dread things?

4
00:01:26,304 --> 00:01:29,501
I wouldn't wanna miss a party,
but every time I go to one...

5
00:01:29,664 --> 00:01:33,339
...I keep feeling like
the whole world's against me.

6
00:01:33,504 --> 00:01:36,701
See, I've spent my whole life
in military academies.

7
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:39,697
My mother doesn't have a place for me
where she lives...

8
00:01:39,864 --> 00:01:42,298
...and she doesn't know
what else to do with me.

9
00:01:42,464 --> 00:01:47,015
You mustn't misunderstand about
my mother. She's really a lovely person.

10
00:01:47,184 --> 00:01:51,575
I guess every boy thinks his mother
is beautiful, but my mother really is.

11
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:56,181
She tells me in every letter how sorry
she is that we're not together more...

12
00:01:56,344 --> 00:01:59,416
...but she has to think of her work.

13
00:01:59,584 --> 00:02:03,372
One time we were together, though.
She met me in San Francisco once...

14
00:02:03,544 --> 00:02:08,220
...and we were together for two whole
days, just like we were sweethearts.

15
00:02:08,384 --> 00:02:12,059
It was the most wonderful time
I ever had.

16
00:02:12,224 --> 00:02:16,536
Then I had to go back
to the military academy.

17
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:20,856
Every time I walk into that barracks,
I get a kind of... .

18
00:02:26,704 --> 00:02:28,854
A kind of a... .

19
00:02:33,304 --> 00:02:35,101
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:41,944 --> 00:02:44,697
Kind of a depressed feeling.

21
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:48,618
It's got hard, stone walls.
You know what I mean?

22
00:02:49,184 --> 00:02:52,699
I guess I've bored you enough,
telling you about myself.

23
00:02:54,144 --> 00:02:55,736
Thank you.

24
00:02:55,904 --> 00:03:00,056
Sorry about that. I goofed up the last
couple of lines. I guess I'm nervous.

25
00:03:00,344 --> 00:03:02,141
That's okay. You did very well.

26
00:03:14,264 --> 00:03:16,016
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:40,064 --> 00:03:42,703
Thank you. You play very well.

28
00:03:42,864 --> 00:03:47,858
Now Mrs. Tossoff's gonna play notes
for you. Sing them back to us. Like so:

29
00:03:51,784 --> 00:03:56,062
-It's too low for me.
-You're a tenor? You want to start here?

30
00:03:58,624 --> 00:04:00,854
Louder, please.

31
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,175
I'm so nervous.

32
00:04:39,344 --> 00:04:41,619
-I'm not singing.
-But you have to.

33
00:04:41,784 --> 00:04:43,979
-But I came to dance.
-You have to sing too.

34
00:04:44,144 --> 00:04:46,453
-And act, and play an instrument.
-All three?

35
00:04:46,624 --> 00:04:49,582
-It says "performing arts," doesn't it?
-You don't have to do everything.

36
00:04:49,784 --> 00:04:55,416
-Sure as shit helps, baby.
-Thank you. Next group, please. Hurry.

37
00:04:55,584 --> 00:04:58,542
-Oh, I like your nose ring.
-I'm into culture.

38
00:04:58,744 --> 00:05:02,703
-Does that hurt, or is that ethnic?
-Music, please, Mrs. Snell.

39
00:05:02,864 --> 00:05:06,493
Please pay attention.
We have a lot to do today.

40
00:05:09,384 --> 00:05:12,217
-I hate my legs.
-Yeah. Me too.

41
00:05:12,424 --> 00:05:16,212
-I've tried every diet in the whole world.
-Really? Me too.

42
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:21,021
But you can't help your glands.
I'm sorry! I'm just so nervous.

43
00:05:21,184 --> 00:05:24,142
Relax! Come on, use your body.

44
00:05:33,384 --> 00:05:36,979
-Careful. That's 7000 worth of machine.
-Dollars or pounds?

45
00:05:37,144 --> 00:05:40,534
Don't touch the rotary pods.
I got it set on saw-tooth.

46
00:05:40,704 --> 00:05:45,141
Why can't he play piccolo? Something
sensible. Or the accordion, like Papa did.

47
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:48,853
Same reason you drive a checker and
not a Roman chariot. It's progress.

48
00:05:49,024 --> 00:05:52,937
My son's head is into the future.
And Papa could never play the accordion.

49
00:05:57,984 --> 00:06:01,454
-Do you think you're talented?
-You swine! You coward! You cad!

50
00:06:01,664 --> 00:06:04,053
You dare judge me in my misfortitude?

51
00:06:04,224 --> 00:06:07,853
You dare to ask me the question
who is the father of my child?

52
00:06:08,024 --> 00:06:12,495
-You! You! I point to you, Nigel!
-Next, please.

53
00:06:12,744 --> 00:06:17,977
The next group of musicians can
go to the fifth floor now, please.

54
00:06:30,664 --> 00:06:32,416
-Name?
-Excuse me, miss.

55
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:36,213
You don't need his name. He's not here
for the audition. He's my partner.

56
00:06:36,384 --> 00:06:38,454
-What school's he from?
-He ain't into school.

57
00:06:38,624 --> 00:06:43,493
He's just helping me out with my
dancing. But it's me who's auditioning.

58
00:06:43,664 --> 00:06:47,498
Mulholland, Shirley. I'm all fixed up.
I filled in all your papers and all.

59
00:06:47,664 --> 00:06:49,814
He doesn't go upstairs
without filling in his name.

60
00:06:49,984 --> 00:06:54,933
Leroy's his name, but I'm auditioning.
Shirley Mulholland. That's two L's.

61
00:06:55,104 --> 00:06:59,495
-And don't ask him to do no writing.
-Doesn't he talk, even?

62
00:06:59,704 --> 00:07:02,264
He ain't into conversation
until you get to know him.

63
00:07:02,784 --> 00:07:06,663
-Leroy what?
-Leroy Johnson. Can we go up now?

64
00:07:07,184 --> 00:07:09,857
He's not going up
until he checks his knife.

65
00:07:10,024 --> 00:07:13,141
We ain't staying long enough for
no trouble. He's just helping a friend.

66
00:07:13,344 --> 00:07:16,541
He's not helping out anyone
unless he checks his knife.

67
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:20,219
This is the High School for Performing
Arts. We don't cut each other up here.

68
00:07:21,224 --> 00:07:22,942
-You want it?
-I want it.

69
00:07:23,264 --> 00:07:25,573
-You sure you want it?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

70
00:07:26,784 --> 00:07:29,742
-Promise you won't steal it, now?
-I promise.

71
00:07:32,104 --> 00:07:34,413
-Thanks, ma'am.
-Name?

72
00:07:34,624 --> 00:07:37,900
Don't worry, baby. I got lots of knives.

73
00:07:38,744 --> 00:07:41,656
-What are you going to do for us?
-I was gonna sing.

74
00:07:41,864 --> 00:07:45,095
-You don't have to sing, honey.
-We know our rights.

75
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:49,303
-You can't refuse her an audition.
-She's not supposed to sing her audition.

76
00:07:49,464 --> 00:07:54,299
Please, excuse me, if you don't mind.
Honey, you don't have to sing for us...

77
00:07:54,464 --> 00:07:58,093
-...because this is the drama department.
-When she sings, it is drama.

78
00:07:58,384 --> 00:08:00,852
-What's your name, honey?
-Finsecker.

79
00:08:03,264 --> 00:08:04,538
Doris Finsecker.

80
00:08:10,304 --> 00:08:13,216
-Hi.
-How do you do?

81
00:08:13,384 --> 00:08:15,420
-What's your name?
-Ralph Garci.

82
00:08:15,744 --> 00:08:19,737
-Who was your teacher?
-Well, my father taught me.

83
00:08:19,904 --> 00:08:24,500
He's doing work for the government.
I'm not supposed to talk about it...

84
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:30,700
...but my father played some of the
most beautiful symphonies...

85
00:08:30,864 --> 00:08:33,458
-...in the whole world once.
-What did he play?

86
00:08:34,624 --> 00:08:36,501
Trombones.

87
00:08:37,464 --> 00:08:39,739
And French horns.

88
00:08:41,224 --> 00:08:42,213
English horns.

89
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:46,215
-Saxophones.
-Anything else?

90
00:08:46,424 --> 00:08:47,698
Yeah.

91
00:08:49,064 --> 00:08:53,899
-Bongos, maracas, that sort of stuff.
-What did he teach you?

92
00:09:01,824 --> 00:09:03,735
Why don't you
try the dance department.

93
00:09:03,904 --> 00:09:07,260
-Why do you want to go to school here?
-Should I tell him?

94
00:09:07,664 --> 00:09:08,813
Yeah, tell him.

95
00:09:09,584 --> 00:09:12,496
We can't afford a professional
children's school.

96
00:09:14,384 --> 00:09:18,377
Okay. If you want to sing, go ahead.
Then we'll look at your acting.

97
00:09:19,544 --> 00:09:21,182
I'm a little nervous.

98
00:09:21,384 --> 00:09:25,980
Don't be shy, Sheila. Come over here.
What are you going to do?

99
00:09:26,224 --> 00:09:29,102
-I'm doing The Towering lnferno.
-What?

100
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:33,341
-You know, the movie?
-Oh.

101
00:09:33,784 --> 00:09:36,821
All right, I'm playing O.J. Simpson.
I'm in this building.

102
00:09:36,984 --> 00:09:40,454
There's fire all around, right?
So I go to the elevator.

103
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:44,498
Think of it as a concentration exercise.
Just sing to Michael...

104
00:09:44,704 --> 00:09:49,937
-...and don't worry about anybody else.
-I don't think I can. I can't just stare.

105
00:09:50,144 --> 00:09:51,702
He won't mind.

106
00:09:54,984 --> 00:09:59,102
-Waiting for the elevator.
-Press the button, Doris.

107
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:05,098
Her brother Harvey.

108
00:10:25,824 --> 00:10:28,657
Doesn't come, so now I'm getting mad.

109
00:11:07,384 --> 00:11:11,696
Finally it comes, so I get in.
Okay, and there's people all around.

110
00:11:11,864 --> 00:11:14,298
And they're looking right at me.

111
00:11:58,904 --> 00:12:02,738
Yeah, my father taught me. I'm not
supposed to talk about him right now.

112
00:12:02,904 --> 00:12:05,577
He's doing a little bit of work
for the government, but... .

113
00:12:05,744 --> 00:12:09,817
My father is very, very famous.
He danced with the Rockettes.

114
00:12:10,304 --> 00:12:12,295
Sure. Would you begin, please?

115
00:12:13,784 --> 00:12:16,617
-I'll be doing "Swanee River" for you.
-Okay.

116
00:12:16,784 --> 00:12:19,252
And... .

117
00:12:19,424 --> 00:12:24,134
Hon? "Swanee River," please.
Hit it.

118
00:12:28,224 --> 00:12:31,819
Doris, what would you do
if you don't make it?

119
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:33,419
We'll make it.

120
00:12:33,984 --> 00:12:36,054
Next, please.

121
00:12:36,544 --> 00:12:39,342
But I that am not shaped
for sportive tricks...

122
00:12:39,504 --> 00:12:42,302
...nor made to court
an amorous looking glass...

123
00:12:42,464 --> 00:12:45,501
...I that am-- Cheated of--
Oh, I'm sorry.

124
00:13:01,304 --> 00:13:03,420
Why don't you try
the drama department.

125
00:13:03,624 --> 00:13:08,698
If again "it was not well cut,"
he'd answer, I spake not true:

126
00:13:08,864 --> 00:13:11,094
This is called the Reply Churlish.

127
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:14,302
Nobody talks about it,
but there's a quota system.

128
00:13:14,464 --> 00:13:19,174
Your chances are better if you're black,
Puerto Rican or everything, like me.

129
00:13:19,344 --> 00:13:23,462
-I am Puerto Rican.
-Not on your paper you ain't, Garci.

130
00:13:23,624 --> 00:13:27,253
-Your daddy doing government work.
-That's the truth.

131
00:13:27,544 --> 00:13:31,537
And he left you his tap shoes, right?
Does he work for Pepsi-Cola too?

132
00:13:32,224 --> 00:13:33,259
Be careful.

133
00:13:33,504 --> 00:13:36,064
-To the left. Left.
-Come the other way.

134
00:13:36,224 --> 00:13:37,816
All right.

135
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,498
Easy, now. Straight back, Bruno?

136
00:13:42,264 --> 00:13:45,142
-Where do you want this at?
-Far corner.

137
00:13:47,504 --> 00:13:49,301
How do you do?

138
00:13:49,504 --> 00:13:51,256
Okay. Fine.

139
00:13:51,424 --> 00:13:55,497
Great. Look, I'll do that. You just go
and get the rest of the stuff, okay?

140
00:13:55,664 --> 00:13:57,655
Oh, Martelli. Bruno Martelli.

141
00:13:57,984 --> 00:14:01,181
Would you like to set up
your equipment, Mr. Martelli?

142
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,817
Who taught you?

143
00:14:07,984 --> 00:14:13,502
Who taught me? My father taught me.
He's in Spain. He makes Westerns.

144
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:17,816
-Why do you want to go to school here?
-Because Freddie went here.

145
00:14:18,064 --> 00:14:21,852
-Freddie?
-Freddie Prinze. He's the best.

146
00:14:22,024 --> 00:14:25,619
-So you want to be an actor, huh?
-Yeah, sure, I want to be an actor.

147
00:14:25,784 --> 00:14:28,218
Judy, Judy, Judy.
Top of the world, Ma.

148
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:32,855
We don't want you to perform. We want
to see who you are. You understand?

149
00:14:33,184 --> 00:14:35,334
-Right.
-Use your own experience.

150
00:14:35,704 --> 00:14:38,537
Be simple, be honest,
but most of all, be yourself.

151
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:42,898
-Be honest. Be simple. Be yourself?
-Be yourself.

152
00:14:44,344 --> 00:14:48,542
I'm God, see? And God
is Puerto Rican, you got that? Now.

153
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:53,097
God works in a casa de steam,
you know. It's a steam bath, right?

154
00:14:53,264 --> 00:14:59,134
And he's talking to this angel. This angel
is a computer. An electronic computer.

155
00:14:59,304 --> 00:15:03,934
I'm God, see? That's why I'm standing
on this chair, you got that? Good.

156
00:15:13,024 --> 00:15:16,380
Does he wanna be a musician
or an airline pilot?

157
00:15:17,424 --> 00:15:21,178
Mr. Martelli. We are ready when you are.
Would you care to begin?

158
00:15:21,384 --> 00:15:23,898
Oh, okay. Sure.

159
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:48,853
Mr. Martelli.

160
00:15:51,224 --> 00:15:53,101
Mr. Martelli.

161
00:15:57,024 --> 00:15:58,139
Mr. Martelli!

162
00:16:00,064 --> 00:16:03,579
Thank you. One instrument
at a time will be quite sufficient.

163
00:16:03,784 --> 00:16:06,457
I could do it in 4/4
if you prefer a disco beat.

164
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:34,144
She's a disaster.

165
00:17:37,184 --> 00:17:42,736
Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name.

166
00:17:42,904 --> 00:17:45,657
Or, if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love...

167
00:17:45,824 --> 00:17:50,454
...and then I'll no longer be a Capu--
Capu-- Capu-something.

168
00:17:50,624 --> 00:17:54,697
-Capulet.
-Like Cappelletti, the football player?

169
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:56,934
-Something like that.
-That's what I mean.

170
00:18:01,144 --> 00:18:04,102
-Where's his application?
-He doesn't have one.

171
00:18:04,264 --> 00:18:06,380
Well, get him one.

172
00:18:23,784 --> 00:18:26,617
-What do you call that?
-Wicked.

173
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,183
Thou art thyself.

174
00:18:40,344 --> 00:18:43,416
Thou art not a Montagoo--
Montagazz-- Who knows?

175
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:49,102
This is the last day of auditions. We've
seen a lot of students. We're punchy.

176
00:18:49,304 --> 00:18:54,583
We're gonna take a break. Go next door
to Mrs. Shime. Have her audition you.

177
00:18:54,744 --> 00:18:57,736
-Right next door.
-I tell her that you sent me?

178
00:18:57,904 --> 00:18:59,735
-Yeah.
-All right.

179
00:18:59,904 --> 00:19:01,257
By the way...

180
00:19:01,424 --> 00:19:05,417
-...you were reading the girl's part.
-Shit.

181
00:19:06,504 --> 00:19:10,292
-You're not into high school, remember?
-I'm into dancing.

182
00:19:10,464 --> 00:19:15,584
You're into ass, you mean. You don't
have to go to high school for that.

183
00:19:15,744 --> 00:19:20,534
-I was doing you a favor, remember?
-Some fat fucking favor.

184
00:19:21,704 --> 00:19:27,097
Take your things to the third floor.
Give your forms to the senior there.

185
00:19:27,424 --> 00:19:31,895
Okay, you go downstairs, change
in the girls' room and wait for him.

186
00:19:32,064 --> 00:19:35,261
I'm through?
I don't have to dance anymore?

187
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,302
Where you going, Leroy?
He's in and I'm out, right?

188
00:19:38,504 --> 00:19:44,295
Fuck you, Leroy! This was my audition,
remember? You're not into high school.

189
00:19:44,464 --> 00:19:49,822
We were rehearsing to get me into this
school, not you, you fucker! It's not fair!

190
00:19:49,984 --> 00:19:53,579
I didn't want to come here anyway.
This school sucks.

191
00:19:53,784 --> 00:19:55,900
You've done me a favor, shithead.

192
00:19:56,104 --> 00:20:00,177
You saved me four fucking years
from this ass-licking school!

193
00:20:00,384 --> 00:20:03,581
You looking at one happy lady!

194
00:20:04,784 --> 00:20:08,379
Who wants to go to a fucking school
to learn to dance, anyway?

195
00:20:10,104 --> 00:20:11,742
Yeah, hello?

196
00:20:11,904 --> 00:20:17,183
No, it isn't. This is Naomi Finsecker
speaking. Her mother. Who is this?

197
00:20:26,504 --> 00:20:30,782
Replacement?
What do you mean, replacement?

198
00:20:34,664 --> 00:20:37,258
So is she in or is she out?

199
00:20:40,224 --> 00:20:43,341
I got in! I got in!
I got into Performing Arts!

200
00:20:47,904 --> 00:20:50,464
Doris, we're in!

201
00:21:38,624 --> 00:21:41,184
Get her out of there!

202
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:48,053
-Hey, later on.
-All right. All right!

203
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,454
See y'all later.

204
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:54,256
-Hello.
-Hey, mama, get in the car!

205
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:01,374
Come on, baby, come on.
Don't go to school.

206
00:22:01,544 --> 00:22:04,854
-Martelli, Bruno.
-Bruno. Come on.

207
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:06,742
Garcia, Raul.

208
00:22:07,984 --> 00:22:11,101
-Garcia, Raul?
-It's Ralph.

209
00:22:12,704 --> 00:22:15,423
-It says Raul.
-I don't relate to that.

210
00:22:16,584 --> 00:22:19,417
-Garcia, Ralph.
-It's Garci.

211
00:22:19,584 --> 00:22:23,497
Ralph Garci. I think they
spelled it wrong on the application.

212
00:22:23,664 --> 00:22:26,132
-Garci, Ralph.
-Here.

213
00:22:28,704 --> 00:22:30,934
-MacNeil, Montgomery.
-Here.

214
00:22:31,504 --> 00:22:34,462
-Monroe, Lisa.
-Yes?

215
00:22:35,904 --> 00:22:37,019
Johnson, Leroy.

216
00:22:39,144 --> 00:22:40,463
Johnson, Leroy?

217
00:22:42,624 --> 00:22:47,379
In future, Mr. Johnson, I'd like you to
leave your ghetto blaster at home.

218
00:22:47,744 --> 00:22:51,259
I'd have left it home
if it wasn't so goddamn boring in here.

219
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:57,581
This is a classroom, Mr. Johnson. You're
going to be here for four years...

220
00:22:57,744 --> 00:23:01,054
...with your eyes open,
homework done, pencils sharpened...

221
00:23:01,224 --> 00:23:06,776
...and all food, cigarettes and radios
outside. Do you understand me?

222
00:23:08,624 --> 00:23:12,333
-Why are you here, Mr. Johnson?
-Because I's young and single...

223
00:23:12,504 --> 00:23:15,496
-...and I loves to mingle.
-Speak English.

224
00:23:15,664 --> 00:23:19,976
-I speak like I likes.
-This is my room. You'll speak as I like.

225
00:23:20,144 --> 00:23:24,501
I teach English. Now, if that's
a foreign language, you're gonna learn it.

226
00:23:26,544 --> 00:23:31,538
This is no Mickey Mouse school. You
won't get off easy because of talent.

227
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:35,703
-I don't care how well you dance...
-Bitch run her fucking mouth.

228
00:23:35,904 --> 00:23:39,863
...or how many colored tutus you have.
If you don't give academic subjects...

229
00:23:40,024 --> 00:23:43,733
-...equal time, you're out.
-Bullshit.

230
00:23:43,904 --> 00:23:47,260
You have to arrive earlier
to get dressed and warmed up.

231
00:23:47,424 --> 00:23:50,575
You have to take outside classes
in your major field...

232
00:23:50,744 --> 00:23:55,420
...and study ballet, modern, folk,
jazz, tap and historical dance here...

233
00:23:55,584 --> 00:23:58,257
...as well as dance history,
supported adagio...

234
00:23:58,584 --> 00:24:03,578
...variation class, makeup, hairstyling
and even acting for dancers.

235
00:24:03,744 --> 00:24:08,898
50,000 people call themselves actors,
and maybe 500 are making a living at it.

236
00:24:09,064 --> 00:24:13,057
Most of those do commercials to
pay the rent. The rest wait tables...

237
00:24:13,224 --> 00:24:17,456
...clean other people's apartments,
living on welfare and hope.

238
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:19,899
Don't think talent's enough
to get you through.

239
00:24:20,064 --> 00:24:24,376
You gotta have a strong technique,
a good agent, and most of all, thick skin.

240
00:24:24,584 --> 00:24:28,657
Now you're part of an underprivileged
minority, and you're going to suffer.

241
00:24:28,864 --> 00:24:33,016
Pulled tendons, shin splints,
swollen toes, smelly tights... .

242
00:24:33,184 --> 00:24:36,494
Cattle calls, the humiliation,
the rejection... .

243
00:24:36,664 --> 00:24:41,818
Melodic dictation theory, keyboard
harmony, piano, piano literature...

244
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:47,741
...music history, orchestration,
conducting, symphonic band... .

245
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:51,419
-When do we have lunch?
-Lunch is at 1 1 :30. One half-hour...

246
00:24:51,584 --> 00:24:54,621
-...and then you'll have everything else.
-What's everything else?

247
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:59,904
Biology, chemistry, algebra, English,
French, physics, history, et cetera.

248
00:25:00,264 --> 00:25:03,336
Dance is not a way
of getting through school.

249
00:25:03,504 --> 00:25:07,656
It's a way of life, plus school.
The school part is easier.

250
00:25:07,864 --> 00:25:12,062
So you better like yourself a lot.
Because that's all you got to work with.

251
00:25:12,224 --> 00:25:16,103
Use yourself.
Your voice, your experiences.

252
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:21,019
Wanna accumulate some experiences?
I got plenty of experiences to spare.

253
00:25:22,584 --> 00:25:26,099
You know what?
I live with two chicks.

254
00:25:26,304 --> 00:25:29,137
Dance is the hardest
department in the school.

255
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,812
Acting is the hardest
profession in the world.

256
00:25:32,024 --> 00:25:37,417
Music is the hardest profession of
them all. Isn't that right, Mrs. Tossoff?

257
00:25:37,584 --> 00:25:38,619
Indeed.

258
00:26:32,264 --> 00:26:33,822
Okay.

259
00:26:36,664 --> 00:26:39,098
No fighting. Stay in line, please.

260
00:26:40,664 --> 00:26:41,699
Who's next?

261
00:26:51,664 --> 00:26:53,382
Excuse me.

262
00:26:54,824 --> 00:26:58,863
-I'll be doing my scene Thursday... .
-I'll be right back.

263
00:27:04,904 --> 00:27:06,417
Get out of my seat!

264
00:30:54,704 --> 00:30:58,902
-Hi.
-Hi. That's too wild for me.

265
00:30:59,944 --> 00:31:02,617
-I'm in your acting class.
-I know.

266
00:31:02,784 --> 00:31:04,854
Montgomery MacNeil.

267
00:31:05,504 --> 00:31:08,462
-Doris Finsecker.
-Hi. Wanna sit down?

268
00:31:08,624 --> 00:31:13,061
All right. Is your mother really
Marsha MacNeil, the actress?

269
00:31:13,224 --> 00:31:15,340
-That's right.
-She does wonderful work.

270
00:31:15,664 --> 00:31:18,258
-Have you seen her?
-But I've heard.

271
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:24,179
-I didn't know she lived in New York.
-She doesn't. Officially, she does...

272
00:31:24,344 --> 00:31:28,622
...but she's been on the road forever.
She gets paid to stay in hotels...

273
00:31:28,784 --> 00:31:32,697
...but she stays with friends. Sends her
per diems home to me and Dr. Golden.

274
00:31:32,944 --> 00:31:36,493
-Is that your stepfather?
-My analyst.

275
00:31:37,824 --> 00:31:39,940
What's wrong with you?

276
00:31:40,384 --> 00:31:43,581
It's pretty technical, really.
I have problems.

277
00:31:47,184 --> 00:31:50,460
-What kind of problems?
-With women.

278
00:31:57,224 --> 00:32:00,819
Fine. Swaying with a nice humming
sound, please. And:

279
00:32:02,664 --> 00:32:04,256
Let the arms go.

280
00:32:09,024 --> 00:32:12,221
Good, good, good.
And chew.

281
00:32:14,464 --> 00:32:15,863
Faster.

282
00:32:16,424 --> 00:32:18,380
Speed.

283
00:32:18,544 --> 00:32:21,104
Tongues out.
Down.

284
00:32:21,304 --> 00:32:22,783
Side. Side.

285
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:25,817
And round, round.
Come on.

286
00:32:35,384 --> 00:32:37,978
More energy!

287
00:32:40,624 --> 00:32:43,422
Do it together, please.
Keep moving.

288
00:32:43,904 --> 00:32:47,658
Much better.
Much, much better now.

289
00:32:54,144 --> 00:32:55,702
Reach for the jeté!

290
00:32:56,464 --> 00:32:59,024
And:

291
00:32:59,184 --> 00:33:02,221
Impulse to impulse.

292
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:38,623
Relax.

293
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,183
Relax.

294
00:33:41,624 --> 00:33:45,060
Sense the floor against your bodies.

295
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:48,941
Feel it against
the backs of your legs.

296
00:33:49,464 --> 00:33:51,022
Your arms.

297
00:33:51,784 --> 00:33:53,456
Your shoulders.

298
00:33:53,864 --> 00:33:56,458
Let your senses remember...

299
00:33:56,624 --> 00:34:00,094
...this feeling of heaviness.

300
00:34:00,704 --> 00:34:04,060
Relax and breathe.

301
00:34:04,864 --> 00:34:08,698
Relax and breathe.

302
00:34:10,464 --> 00:34:15,663
All right, let's go. Thank you.
Don't be late. Come on. Don't be late.

303
00:34:37,384 --> 00:34:40,217
-Should you be on this floor?
-I have a note.

304
00:34:40,384 --> 00:34:43,421
-Miss Berg wants a tambourine.
-Fine.

305
00:34:47,104 --> 00:34:50,653
Excuse me? Excuse me?
You speak English?

306
00:34:50,824 --> 00:34:52,894
-Bruno Martelli?
-He's across the hall.

307
00:34:53,064 --> 00:34:54,622
Thanks.

308
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,732
-Hi.
-Hi.

309
00:35:03,424 --> 00:35:06,541
-What kind of music notes are those?
-Laser beams.

310
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:10,458
-It's a requiem for Buck Rogers.
-Great.

311
00:35:11,184 --> 00:35:14,938
-You ever thought of doing real music?
-This is my music.

312
00:35:15,104 --> 00:35:17,982
-I mean a band.
-I don't like bands. They crowd me.

313
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:22,376
-I prefer my basement, no people.
-There's money though, in summer trade.

314
00:35:22,544 --> 00:35:25,456
-If we get together in time.
-I'm really not interested.

315
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:29,299
There's tea dances and parties,
weddings and bar mitzvahs.

316
00:35:29,464 --> 00:35:33,252
Those things are steady. People always
get married and grow up.

317
00:35:33,424 --> 00:35:36,382
-I don't need the hassle.
-I'll take care of everything...

318
00:35:36,544 --> 00:35:38,614
...just like a regular business manager.

319
00:35:38,784 --> 00:35:43,016
I'll look after the bookings, travel,
costume designs, for 1 0% off the top.

320
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:45,254
Then a straight split
of the performing cut.

321
00:35:45,424 --> 00:35:49,383
-What costume designs?
-Nothing fancy, just sequins and stuff.

322
00:35:49,544 --> 00:35:52,854
See-through for me, maybe low-cut.
We gotta give them visuals.

323
00:35:53,024 --> 00:35:58,144
The sound might be wicked, but when
you get down to it, tits book bands.

324
00:35:58,304 --> 00:36:02,058
-I think I'll stay in my basement.
-Bruno, this is our chance.

325
00:36:02,224 --> 00:36:07,582
-Don't you want success?
-Sure. I don't think our tits are up to it.

326
00:36:12,864 --> 00:36:14,536
Why?

327
00:36:15,504 --> 00:36:18,098
Oh, why?

328
00:36:20,024 --> 00:36:23,733
God will punish you,
Yuri Yajeyopeyonoff.

329
00:36:25,024 --> 00:36:28,221
What crime is this unborn
child guilty of...

330
00:36:28,384 --> 00:36:31,296
...that it should not drink of
the milk of paradise?

331
00:36:31,464 --> 00:36:35,173
You warned me, Elena.
Not one ruble have I lost, not one.

332
00:36:39,224 --> 00:36:43,740
-Can we try this again? It sounds phony.
-I don't wanna try this again.

333
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:47,783
-There's nothing wrong with you.
-I know. That's what's wrong with me.

334
00:36:47,944 --> 00:36:53,496
Everybody here is colorful or eccentric
or charismatic. I'm perfectly ordinary.

335
00:36:53,664 --> 00:36:59,216
My nose is ordinary. My body's ordinary.
And my voice, it's--

336
00:36:59,744 --> 00:37:02,383
-I don't know why I'm here.
-You wanna be an actress.

337
00:37:02,544 --> 00:37:06,822
Yeah, but actors and actresses
are colorful, flamboyant beings.

338
00:37:07,104 --> 00:37:10,255
I'm about as flamboyant as a bagel.

339
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,978
Hi.

340
00:37:12,144 --> 00:37:14,135
-Hi.
-Hi.

341
00:37:14,784 --> 00:37:17,821
-Some people like bagels.
-Some people don't.

342
00:37:17,984 --> 00:37:21,101
-Some people are too old for you.
-He smiles at me.

343
00:37:21,264 --> 00:37:24,222
-He smiles at everyone.
-Yeah, but he winks too.

344
00:37:24,384 --> 00:37:27,581
-I think it's a nervous habit.
-He talks to me, often.

345
00:37:27,864 --> 00:37:30,583
-Really? What's he say?
-Hi.

346
00:37:30,864 --> 00:37:33,936
That's serious. Have you set the date?

347
00:37:37,064 --> 00:37:39,020
I'm sorry.

348
00:37:39,984 --> 00:37:42,259
-I'm sorry.
-I feel stupid.

349
00:37:42,424 --> 00:37:43,459
So get into it.

350
00:37:43,624 --> 00:37:45,854
Study it. Try to remember it
so you can--

351
00:37:45,984 --> 00:37:46,973
Hey, M and M.

352
00:37:47,144 --> 00:37:48,896
Seen your shrink lately?

353
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,744
-Yesterday.
-You got a special delivery?

354
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:53,862
How you doing? How are you?

355
00:37:55,184 --> 00:37:57,823
Oh, good. That's very good.
You're a good man.

356
00:37:58,624 --> 00:38:01,184
They're not for me.
They're for a friend of mine.

357
00:38:02,904 --> 00:38:04,337
Who's the lucky fella, huh?

358
00:38:04,944 --> 00:38:08,175
Looks like somebody finally
corked up old Finsecker.

359
00:38:08,504 --> 00:38:11,098
It can't be Gloria over here.
He's not into chicks.

360
00:38:14,864 --> 00:38:16,217
Shut my mouth.

361
00:38:17,784 --> 00:38:18,773
Bye.

362
00:38:20,104 --> 00:38:22,493
I hate Ralph Garci, I really do.

363
00:38:22,944 --> 00:38:25,504
I must remember this feeling
and use it in my acting.

364
00:38:28,624 --> 00:38:29,818
I'm scared.

365
00:38:29,984 --> 00:38:34,455
I'm scared I won't be able to live up
to their expectations of me.

366
00:38:36,744 --> 00:38:39,053
Flashing images of passion--

367
00:38:42,184 --> 00:38:46,143
--and hurl you to the ground
and make mad, passionate love.

368
00:38:47,104 --> 00:38:49,015
-I forgot it!
-For two weeks?

369
00:38:49,184 --> 00:38:52,062
-I told you, I done it and I forgot it.
-My hearing's fine.

370
00:38:52,224 --> 00:38:56,297
It's your homework that's missing.
And these pages are unintelligible.

371
00:38:57,104 --> 00:39:00,141
It's a secret language.
It ain't meant for whiteys.

372
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:02,534
-This isn't a joke.
-I got lots of jokes.

373
00:39:02,864 --> 00:39:05,298
-This is garbage!
-My pen broke.

374
00:39:05,504 --> 00:39:08,382
-It's in pencil.
-That broke too.

375
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:11,183
You can't learn to read,
you can't learn to dance.

376
00:39:11,424 --> 00:39:13,654
You're flunking out.

377
00:39:13,824 --> 00:39:14,893
I can read.

378
00:39:15,064 --> 00:39:17,897
Terrific! Go ahead, surprise us.
Give him your book.

379
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,339
Pay attention.
Mr. Johnson is gonna read.

380
00:39:21,264 --> 00:39:23,573
-I said I can read!
-Then read.

381
00:39:24,704 --> 00:39:26,137
-No.
-Read!

382
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,738
-No!
-Read!

383
00:39:27,904 --> 00:39:29,223
No, you fucking bitch!

384
00:39:29,384 --> 00:39:33,821
What the fuck you want me to do,
asking me to read all the fucking time?

385
00:39:33,984 --> 00:39:36,373
I hate your guts. You read,
you fucking bitch!

386
00:40:42,704 --> 00:40:43,819
It's not natural.

387
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:46,054
Get off my case, huh, Papa?

388
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:50,938
When I was your age, Bruno,
I had a lot of girlfriends.

389
00:40:51,104 --> 00:40:53,982
-I had a different girlfriend every day.
-I got music.

390
00:40:54,944 --> 00:40:56,855
Same to you, pal! Go ahead.

391
00:40:57,024 --> 00:41:01,336
Go ahead! Oh, sure, you got music,
okay. But for what? For yourself.

392
00:41:01,464 --> 00:41:02,453
For your headset.

393
00:41:02,704 --> 00:41:06,140
I mean, do I hear it anymore?
Does your mama hear it?

394
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,578
Do your friends hear it?

395
00:41:07,904 --> 00:41:09,895
Bruno, do you have friends? Huh?

396
00:41:10,064 --> 00:41:13,818
-I don't have time. I told you.
-You told me. You told me.

397
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:16,862
It's not natural. When I was your age,
I'm telling you--

398
00:41:17,024 --> 00:41:19,902
You're not my age. Nobody's my age.
I'm ahead of my time.

399
00:41:20,064 --> 00:41:22,055
Maybe I don't think
people will like my stuff.

400
00:41:22,224 --> 00:41:26,695
How do you know what people will like?
How do they know if they don't hear it?

401
00:41:26,864 --> 00:41:30,459
Bruno, how do they recognize your talent
and give you scholarships...

402
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,854
...and record contracts, son,
and awards?

403
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:36,620
Maybe I die undiscovered,
and my ghost gets the Grammy.

404
00:41:36,784 --> 00:41:41,175
Maybe! Look, did I build you a studio
in the basement for a ghost?

405
00:41:41,344 --> 00:41:44,859
Did I spent $7000 on equipment
for a ghost?

406
00:41:45,104 --> 00:41:49,973
Does your mama cook and clean and
wear old clothes for a ghost? A ghost?

407
00:41:50,144 --> 00:41:53,420
Elton John's mom has got
six mink coats.

408
00:43:02,624 --> 00:43:08,381
"Wel-- Wel-- Welcome to...

409
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:12,219
...the wo-- Won--

410
00:43:12,384 --> 00:43:16,536
Wonderful...

411
00:43:16,704 --> 00:43:20,856
...world of...

412
00:43:21,024 --> 00:43:26,542
...Ma-- Maytag...

413
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:30,777
...wash-- Wash-- Washing...

414
00:43:30,944 --> 00:43:33,902
...mach-- Ma--

415
00:43:34,064 --> 00:43:36,214
Machines. "

416
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,258
Talk about Shorofsky.

417
00:44:15,424 --> 00:44:21,056
Mr. Shorofsky does not understand any
music past Mozart when he was 2.

418
00:44:21,224 --> 00:44:23,260
They're all the same.
What do you expect?

419
00:44:24,264 --> 00:44:28,701
Graduating from P.A. is no Academy
Award. You know what I mean.

420
00:44:29,424 --> 00:44:33,178
It is better than real school. It's free,
and you don't get raped in the hallways.

421
00:44:33,344 --> 00:44:35,904
But it's still small change.

422
00:44:36,064 --> 00:44:39,261
I'm just killing time here,
waiting for my opportunity.

423
00:44:39,424 --> 00:44:42,063
It might be a movie
or a Broadway musical.

424
00:44:42,224 --> 00:44:44,784
But it's coming. I keep my eyes open.

425
00:44:44,944 --> 00:44:47,981
I read Back Stage, Show Business
and Variety.

426
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:50,294
You see, I do the whole thing.

427
00:44:50,464 --> 00:44:53,661
Dancing's just the tip
of this iceberg.

428
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:57,100
A friend of my sister,
she tells fortunes and stuff.

429
00:44:57,264 --> 00:45:00,620
She says I'm doing my last dance
on this dark little planet.

430
00:45:00,784 --> 00:45:02,979
So it's gotta be spectacular, you know?

431
00:45:03,144 --> 00:45:05,738
How bright our spirits
go shooting out into space...

432
00:45:05,904 --> 00:45:10,022
...depends on how much we contributed
to the earthly brilliance of this world.

433
00:45:10,184 --> 00:45:13,893
And I mean to be a major contributor.

434
00:45:15,024 --> 00:45:17,174
A sure-as-shit major contributor.

435
00:45:23,904 --> 00:45:26,543
-Can someone just--?
-She's cleaning her cleavage.

436
00:45:26,704 --> 00:45:31,016
She's taking out the lint. Oh,
that's beautiful. I wish I had a camera.

437
00:45:31,184 --> 00:45:34,335
There she is. Get out of the way.
She's gorgeous.

438
00:45:34,504 --> 00:45:36,699
Oh, now turn around, please.

439
00:45:37,024 --> 00:45:38,537
Oh, please.

440
00:45:38,704 --> 00:45:40,217
Oh, look at those tits.

441
00:45:40,544 --> 00:45:42,057
Oh, you could drown in those.

442
00:45:42,224 --> 00:45:47,423
I want you to observe yourself
doing ordinary, everyday things.

443
00:45:47,904 --> 00:45:50,464
You'll be asked to duplicate
those here in class.

444
00:45:50,624 --> 00:45:52,899
An actor must develop
an acute sense memory...

445
00:45:53,064 --> 00:45:57,342
...so concentrate on how you deal
with things in your world...

446
00:45:57,504 --> 00:46:01,577
...how you wash your face
or hold your fork or lift your cup...

447
00:46:01,744 --> 00:46:07,023
...comb your hair. Observe and study
your own mechanicalness.

448
00:46:07,184 --> 00:46:11,814
See if you can catch yourself in the
very act of doing or saying something.

449
00:46:12,944 --> 00:46:17,654
See if your actions and reactions fall into
patterns and what those patterns are.

450
00:46:17,824 --> 00:46:21,419
And in particular, pay close attention
to the physical world.

451
00:46:21,584 --> 00:46:25,577
Isolate and concentrate on the details.

452
00:46:36,944 --> 00:46:39,412
Oh, mamacita!

453
00:46:43,744 --> 00:46:45,257
Ay, caramba!

454
00:46:52,384 --> 00:46:55,820
No! No! No! Give me that!

455
00:46:55,984 --> 00:46:58,544
You must hold your bow like this,
not like that.

456
00:46:58,704 --> 00:47:00,501
It's not your dick you're holding.

457
00:47:00,664 --> 00:47:04,782
Excuse me, miss. It's a violin bow.
Hold it with a little respect, like--

458
00:47:04,944 --> 00:47:06,775
Like your dick?

459
00:47:06,944 --> 00:47:09,094
Shut up. Again.

460
00:47:38,944 --> 00:47:41,902
Watch your plié, Coco.

461
00:47:43,024 --> 00:47:46,539
Turn out the arch, Leroy.

462
00:47:47,024 --> 00:47:48,457
Nice, Neisha.

463
00:47:49,904 --> 00:47:52,020
I want to see the leg, Patrick.

464
00:47:52,184 --> 00:47:55,335
And stretch.

465
00:47:57,184 --> 00:47:58,776
Good.

466
00:48:00,144 --> 00:48:01,816
Keep it together now.

467
00:48:06,624 --> 00:48:10,458
Where's the sweat, Lisa?
You're not even trying.

468
00:48:25,024 --> 00:48:27,822
-Michael, congratulations. I heard.
-Oh, thank you.

469
00:48:27,984 --> 00:48:31,021
Don't thank me. You deserved
the award and the scholarship.

470
00:48:31,184 --> 00:48:33,493
You are the best actor in the school.

471
00:48:33,664 --> 00:48:36,462
Well, you were the best actor
in the school.

472
00:48:36,624 --> 00:48:38,774
I mean, we'll miss you.

473
00:48:38,944 --> 00:48:40,218
Well, I'll miss you too.

474
00:48:40,464 --> 00:48:41,738
-You will?
-Yeah, sure.

475
00:48:41,904 --> 00:48:44,134
-We'll keep in touch, I guess, huh?
-Yeah.

476
00:48:44,544 --> 00:48:45,897
Would you sign my yearbook?

477
00:48:46,064 --> 00:48:49,500
Yeah, all right. Do you
want me to sign my picture?

478
00:48:49,664 --> 00:48:52,178
-That'd be great.
-Oh, okay.

479
00:48:52,704 --> 00:48:54,774
-I forgot. What's your name?
-Doris Finsecker.

480
00:48:54,944 --> 00:48:57,014
-Oh, right. Doris.
-But Doris is enough.

481
00:48:57,144 --> 00:48:58,133
Oh, okay.

482
00:48:58,304 --> 00:49:00,772
-Have you decided where you're going?
-California.

483
00:49:00,944 --> 00:49:03,902
-I mean to college, the scholarship.
-I can't use it.

484
00:49:04,064 --> 00:49:06,703
-How come?
-William Morris has got big plans for me.

485
00:49:06,864 --> 00:49:09,503
-They saw me in that Senior Day show.
-You're kidding?

486
00:49:09,664 --> 00:49:12,622
-They wanna represent me.
-They're the biggest agents.

487
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:14,775
-Yeah.
-Well, that's great!

488
00:49:16,024 --> 00:49:18,458
There's a couple of series
they think I'm right for.

489
00:49:18,624 --> 00:49:22,219
I've had a lot of really good meetings.
Everyone's very excited.

490
00:49:22,384 --> 00:49:24,944
That is so great!
I mean, Hollywood, that's like--

491
00:49:25,104 --> 00:49:30,462
Yeah. Well, here I go,
off into the sunset.

492
00:49:30,624 --> 00:49:32,774
Hey, good luck. Oh, sorry.

493
00:49:32,944 --> 00:49:36,539
I mean, break a leg,
or whatever they say.

494
00:49:38,944 --> 00:49:40,457
See you.

495
00:49:41,504 --> 00:49:43,256
Hey!

496
00:49:43,744 --> 00:49:45,177
We'll see you at Schwab's.

497
00:49:49,184 --> 00:49:50,697
Oh, God, Doris!

498
00:50:03,984 --> 00:50:06,054
She's new. I saw her arrive
in a limousine.

499
00:50:06,224 --> 00:50:08,454
A limousine? No kidding?

500
00:50:09,744 --> 00:50:12,941
-Man, I hope to fuck she's in drama.
-No way. Dance department.

501
00:50:13,104 --> 00:50:15,493
She's too beautiful. Look at that ass.

502
00:50:15,664 --> 00:50:19,657
-I don't know about her tits.
-What do you mean? What kind of tits?

503
00:50:22,224 --> 00:50:24,533
-Tits... . Pointy ones?
-She looks kind of flat.

504
00:50:24,704 --> 00:50:25,898
She's fucking gorgeous!

505
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:28,214
Little-bitty ones
with nips like raisins?

506
00:50:28,384 --> 00:50:30,693
She's turning around. Look at that ass.

507
00:50:30,864 --> 00:50:33,742
-Oh, she is a dancer.
-Let me up. Let me up!

508
00:50:38,144 --> 00:50:40,533
Let me see, you fuckers.

509
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:52,302
Last year, we worked
on simple observations.

510
00:50:52,544 --> 00:50:56,935
This year, we're going to turn
that observation inward...

511
00:50:57,104 --> 00:50:59,823
...and work on re-creating
emotional states:

512
00:50:59,984 --> 00:51:03,738
Fear, joy, sorrow, anger.

513
00:51:03,904 --> 00:51:08,898
And it'll be more difficult because you'll
have to expose more of you...

514
00:51:09,064 --> 00:51:11,737
...what's on the inside of you.

515
00:51:11,904 --> 00:51:14,702
For your first acting exercise
this year, I want you...

516
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:18,061
...to re-create a difficult memory...

517
00:51:18,224 --> 00:51:22,695
...a painful moment when you learned
something about yourself that hurt.

518
00:51:22,864 --> 00:51:26,140
And I mean really hurt.

519
00:51:26,304 --> 00:51:28,295
And reach.

520
00:51:29,104 --> 00:51:32,062
And through. And drop.

521
00:51:32,224 --> 00:51:34,533
And back.

522
00:51:40,304 --> 00:51:42,420
Hi, I'm Lisa Monroe.

523
00:51:43,584 --> 00:51:44,858
Hilary van Doren.

524
00:51:45,184 --> 00:51:46,458
I love your coat.

525
00:51:46,624 --> 00:51:48,182
I saw that in Bendel's window.

526
00:51:49,264 --> 00:51:52,859
-My stepmother bought it for me.
-Really?

527
00:51:53,024 --> 00:51:55,902
I wouldn't mind that kind of stepmother.

528
00:51:56,544 --> 00:52:00,219
She didn't do it for me.
She wants my father to think she cares.

529
00:52:00,384 --> 00:52:03,023
Besides, she loves shopping.

530
00:52:03,184 --> 00:52:06,301
She gets multiple orgasm
every time she buys something.

531
00:52:06,784 --> 00:52:08,854
Sounds great. I think I like her.

532
00:52:09,024 --> 00:52:10,298
You can have her.

533
00:52:10,704 --> 00:52:14,060
-Where's all the sweat, Lisa?
-I'm working on it.

534
00:52:14,544 --> 00:52:16,774
You're not working on it hard enough.

535
00:52:16,944 --> 00:52:18,900
Get rid of the gum.

536
00:52:29,744 --> 00:52:31,223
Watch me.

537
00:52:33,664 --> 00:52:35,575
Lift the bow off the string, Martelli.

538
00:52:36,064 --> 00:52:38,055
Mozart wouldn't do this today.

539
00:52:38,224 --> 00:52:40,294
-Do what?
-This bowing business.

540
00:52:40,464 --> 00:52:42,341
He'd plug his keyboard into an amp...

541
00:52:42,504 --> 00:52:45,576
...and he'd have string quartets
coming out of his fingers.

542
00:52:45,904 --> 00:52:49,021
And who would play all these
science-fiction symphonies?

543
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:51,734
-He would.
-All by himself?

544
00:52:52,144 --> 00:52:55,659
He'd overdub and mix, of course.
He wouldn't make the same old noise.

545
00:52:55,824 --> 00:52:57,655
-Noise?
-He'd sound electric.

546
00:52:57,824 --> 00:53:01,942
He'd have spacier strings and horns
and computerized bassoons.

547
00:53:02,384 --> 00:53:05,296
-One man is not an orchestra.
-Who needs orchestras?

548
00:53:05,464 --> 00:53:09,582
You can do it all with a keyboard,
an amp and enough power.

549
00:53:10,144 --> 00:53:12,419
You're going to play all by yourself?

550
00:53:12,584 --> 00:53:13,983
You don't need anybody else.

551
00:53:14,384 --> 00:53:17,820
That's not music, Martelli.
That's masturbation.

552
00:53:19,744 --> 00:53:22,304
See, I'm not naturally graceful.

553
00:53:22,624 --> 00:53:24,660
Grace doesn't run in our family.

554
00:53:24,824 --> 00:53:28,612
It's our genes. I've had to work
so hard to come this far.

555
00:53:28,784 --> 00:53:31,582
-God, I've been at it since I was 4.
-Me too.

556
00:53:31,744 --> 00:53:33,655
I started out with tap and stuff.

557
00:53:33,824 --> 00:53:37,658
Then my mom kept buying me pretty
ballet tutus, and I got hooked on it.

558
00:53:37,824 --> 00:53:40,543
Less lip, Monroe! More sweat!

559
00:53:41,104 --> 00:53:43,334
-She's just a bitch.
-She hates me.

560
00:53:43,504 --> 00:53:47,053
This is a dance class, Lisa,
not the Charles Atlas plan.

561
00:53:47,344 --> 00:53:50,541
-Shut your mouth.
-Where are your tights?

562
00:53:50,784 --> 00:53:52,775
I told you I got them.
I just forgot them.

563
00:53:52,944 --> 00:53:54,536
What's he talking about?

564
00:53:54,704 --> 00:53:56,774
Tights. He won't wear them.

565
00:53:58,064 --> 00:54:02,615
Look, Leroy, I told you, if you don't have
tights, you don't dance. Now go!

566
00:54:06,224 --> 00:54:08,340
Oh, I love your accent.
What did you say?

567
00:54:08,504 --> 00:54:10,062
I dig his black ass.

568
00:54:10,224 --> 00:54:14,536
-It's taken, Goldilocks.
-Don't count on it.

569
00:54:24,624 --> 00:54:25,898
A painful memory.

570
00:54:26,064 --> 00:54:28,703
What does he mean by
a painful memory?

571
00:54:28,864 --> 00:54:31,173
I don't know. I can't find
a painful memory.

572
00:54:31,344 --> 00:54:32,697
I know I have them.

573
00:54:32,864 --> 00:54:35,662
I mean, my pain's as good
as anybody else's.

574
00:54:35,824 --> 00:54:38,941
I have lots of them. You can borrow
one of mine if you want.

575
00:54:39,104 --> 00:54:43,575
Like, I used to wet my bed. There, that
was painful. You can have that memory.

576
00:54:43,744 --> 00:54:45,018
No, thank you.

577
00:54:45,184 --> 00:54:49,018
Then there was the last time my father
packed his bags and left us.

578
00:54:49,184 --> 00:54:51,015
That really was painful.

579
00:54:51,184 --> 00:54:56,702
Or the first time my mother flew to L.A.
and didn't come back for six weeks.

580
00:54:56,944 --> 00:54:59,663
Or the first time I fell in love.

581
00:54:59,824 --> 00:55:02,133
Where'd that come from?

582
00:55:02,704 --> 00:55:04,695
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

583
00:56:37,504 --> 00:56:39,096
You're gonna tell everybody that?

584
00:56:39,744 --> 00:56:42,133
It's the most painful memory
I can think of.

585
00:56:42,304 --> 00:56:44,943
He didn't say the most painful.
He just said painful.

586
00:56:45,104 --> 00:56:48,938
-We're supposed to expose ourselves.
-Imagine what Ralph Garci will say.

587
00:56:49,264 --> 00:56:53,576
A pie in the face comes with the job.
That's what my mom says. She knows.

588
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:54,938
I don't get it.

589
00:56:55,104 --> 00:56:58,983
A real artist must never be afraid of
what other people will say about him.

590
00:56:59,144 --> 00:57:01,817
It was a time when I realized
something about myself.

591
00:57:02,064 --> 00:57:04,783
-Maybe you didn't realize it right.
-What do you mean?

592
00:57:05,024 --> 00:57:08,653
Well, I mean, everybody falls in love
with their analyst.

593
00:57:08,944 --> 00:57:11,504
There's a word for that, isn't there?

594
00:57:11,664 --> 00:57:14,053
Homosexual.

595
00:58:07,664 --> 00:58:09,336
That's my music.

596
00:58:09,504 --> 00:58:11,256
That lunatic stole my tape.

597
00:58:20,624 --> 00:58:22,023
Wow, that's me.

598
00:58:23,344 --> 00:58:28,702
That's my son's music!
My son Bruno. Bruno Martelli!

599
00:58:28,864 --> 00:58:32,777
He wrote the music.
Today, 46th Street...

600
00:58:32,944 --> 00:58:36,095
...tomorrow, Madison Square Garden.

601
00:58:41,344 --> 00:58:44,177
-Papa, what are you doing?
-Bruno!

602
00:58:44,344 --> 00:58:47,575
You've lost your mind. You're crazy.
Those tapes aren't ready.

603
00:58:47,744 --> 00:58:50,941
Look at the people.
They don't know it's not ready.

604
00:58:51,104 --> 00:58:54,983
Look at it, they like it!
Bruno, they like it! Bruno!

605
00:59:23,264 --> 00:59:26,097
-Hey, yo!
-Huh?

606
00:59:26,264 --> 00:59:29,973
Move your fucking parade!
What do you think this is, 5th Avenue?

607
00:59:30,144 --> 00:59:31,896
Back it up!

608
00:59:32,064 --> 00:59:37,934
I'll get your ass, buddy!
Who do you think you are?

609
00:59:44,704 --> 00:59:47,457
You're next, you hear me?

610
00:59:47,624 --> 00:59:50,263
Get away from there.
What are you doing?

611
00:59:50,424 --> 00:59:51,903
How do you like that?

612
00:59:52,064 --> 00:59:54,259
Pick that up, you son of a bitch!

613
01:00:29,497 --> 01:00:32,694
I thought I was just
going through a stage.

614
01:00:33,977 --> 01:00:36,127
That's what everyone told me.

615
01:00:36,297 --> 01:00:39,209
And it never
worried me when I was 1 0.

616
01:00:40,177 --> 01:00:44,693
Except they told me the same thing
at 1 2 and 1 4.

617
01:00:47,457 --> 01:00:52,485
So finally, my analyst
leveled with me.

618
01:00:52,737 --> 01:00:56,173
He said it was probably a life choice.

619
01:01:01,857 --> 01:01:03,734
It's funny.

620
01:01:05,577 --> 01:01:10,446
"Gay" used to mean
such a happy kind of word once.

621
01:01:12,137 --> 01:01:17,257
Not that it bothers me.
I'm pretty well-adjusted, really.

622
01:01:19,137 --> 01:01:21,093
I mean...

623
01:01:23,857 --> 01:01:26,610
...never being happy...

624
01:01:26,977 --> 01:01:30,287
...isn't the same as being unhappy.

625
01:01:30,537 --> 01:01:32,607
Is it?

626
01:01:34,937 --> 01:01:38,134
Dr. Golden explains it real well.

627
01:01:39,337 --> 01:01:41,134
He explains everything well.

628
01:01:45,137 --> 01:01:46,616
I've had a lot of help.

629
01:01:57,537 --> 01:02:01,496
Hey, Doris, you wanna go to
The Rocky Horror Show tomorrow night?

630
01:02:01,657 --> 01:02:02,851
That sounds great.

631
01:02:03,017 --> 01:02:07,090
It starts at midnight, so you better
check it out with your mom.

632
01:02:07,257 --> 01:02:10,932
Calling Montgomery MacNeil.

633
01:02:11,097 --> 01:02:14,055
Oh, Montgomery.

634
01:02:20,217 --> 01:02:23,254
I suppose that a fuck
is out of the question?

635
01:02:23,417 --> 01:02:26,250
There he is, Ralph Garci,
right on the button.

636
01:02:26,417 --> 01:02:28,453
-Nice.
-Get off!

637
01:02:28,617 --> 01:02:33,486
-I warned you this would happen.
-It's your case, man. I don't give a fuck.

638
01:02:33,657 --> 01:02:36,615
-It's a joke, that's all. It just came out.
-Like me.

639
01:02:36,777 --> 01:02:40,929
Yeah. Hey, Doris, listen,
I meant to tell you.

640
01:02:41,097 --> 01:02:45,170
There's an open call for a movie
at the Diplomat Hotel.

641
01:02:45,337 --> 01:02:48,568
-Oh, yeah?
-They're looking for your type.

642
01:02:48,737 --> 01:02:51,376
-What's my type?
-You know, your type.

643
01:02:51,537 --> 01:02:55,735
-Irishy, Jewishy, paranoid.
-What's the name of this movie?

644
01:02:55,897 --> 01:03:00,049
-I Was a Teenage Fag Hag.
-You shit!

645
01:03:03,417 --> 01:03:04,406
Stop it!

646
01:03:04,577 --> 01:03:07,296
I never knew it would
be like this, Doris.

647
01:03:07,457 --> 01:03:11,336
Oh, come closer, sweetheart.
Oh, my, such embrace.

648
01:03:16,657 --> 01:03:19,569
The Silvermans know
some very important people.

649
01:03:19,737 --> 01:03:23,412
They really have connections.
They're mishpoche with Soupy Sales.

650
01:03:23,577 --> 01:03:26,296
Oh, listen.
Your nice white blouse is ironed.

651
01:03:26,457 --> 01:03:29,733
Or you could wear your pink dress
with the ribbons.

652
01:03:29,897 --> 01:03:32,809
-You look so pretty in that.
-I hate that pink dress.

653
01:03:32,977 --> 01:03:35,696
-So don't wear your pink dress.
-I'm not going, Mama!

654
01:03:35,897 --> 01:03:37,774
-Then gargle.
-I'm going out to dinner!

655
01:03:37,937 --> 01:03:40,690
-It's a catered affair.
-It's not the food!

656
01:03:40,937 --> 01:03:43,167
This is an opportunity to perform.

657
01:03:43,337 --> 01:03:46,215
-Take advantage of it.
-I promised Montgomery!

658
01:03:46,377 --> 01:03:49,255
Well, I promised the Silvermans!

659
01:03:52,137 --> 01:03:55,812
It's a party, Doris.
They need a singer.

660
01:03:55,977 --> 01:04:00,653
And you, you need exposure.
So you're going.

661
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:03,048
I'm not!

662
01:04:47,457 --> 01:04:51,052
Very good, Doris.
What did you realize about yourself?

663
01:04:52,937 --> 01:04:56,930
I don't like birthday parties.
Or pink dresses.

664
01:04:57,857 --> 01:05:01,054
Or the Silvermans. Or Brooklyn.

665
01:05:01,217 --> 01:05:03,606
Or even being Jewish.

666
01:05:03,897 --> 01:05:05,489
I mean, it's not bad...

667
01:05:06,177 --> 01:05:08,566
...but it's not all I am.

668
01:05:08,737 --> 01:05:12,935
I don't know who I am,
and I never will if I don't assert myself.

669
01:05:13,097 --> 01:05:17,409
I'm 1 6 years old.
I've got to assert myself sometime.

670
01:05:19,737 --> 01:05:21,409
Don't l?

671
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:23,853
Okay, Doris. Ralph?

672
01:05:25,777 --> 01:05:28,530
I was coming home from
school one day.

673
01:05:28,697 --> 01:05:29,891
As usual.

674
01:05:30,617 --> 01:05:35,372
I had a couple of pieces of business
to attend to in the neighborhood.

675
01:05:36,497 --> 01:05:38,567
It was January.

676
01:05:39,057 --> 01:05:41,366
It was snowing like crazy.

677
01:05:44,057 --> 01:05:47,094
Santa Claus just ripped
everybody off.

678
01:05:47,577 --> 01:05:50,535
He split for Toy Town or lgloo City...

679
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:53,814
...or the North Pole
or wherever the hell he goes.

680
01:05:56,377 --> 01:05:58,413
So anyway... .

681
01:05:59,577 --> 01:06:02,455
I was going home, and... .

682
01:06:04,577 --> 01:06:06,568
I found this note.

683
01:06:06,977 --> 01:06:09,445
It said my two chicks were in church.

684
01:06:09,617 --> 01:06:12,848
What the hell are my two chicks
doing in church?

685
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:16,367
Somebody die or something?

686
01:06:18,657 --> 01:06:23,287
That was... . That was a joke.
That was supposed to be a joke.

687
01:06:29,817 --> 01:06:33,207
Anyway, I went home.

688
01:06:35,977 --> 01:06:40,971
I dropped a little incense like
I always do, just to unwind a little bit.

689
01:06:43,417 --> 01:06:45,977
And I put on the TV set.

690
01:06:48,777 --> 01:06:51,814
And there was
this guy on the TV.

691
01:06:54,897 --> 01:06:57,411
And he was talking
about Freddie.

692
01:07:00,617 --> 01:07:04,371
He... . He said that... .

693
01:07:05,977 --> 01:07:11,529
He said that Freddie Prinze
put a gun to his head...

694
01:07:11,697 --> 01:07:15,656
...and he killed himself.

695
01:07:19,057 --> 01:07:22,254
You know, it was an accident, man.

696
01:07:23,777 --> 01:07:27,406
Shit, I mean, he was fucking... .
He was very gifted.

697
01:07:28,417 --> 01:07:33,411
You always laughed at him
because he was very fucking talented.

698
01:07:36,577 --> 01:07:40,286
And sometimes you didn't even
wanna laugh at him...

699
01:07:40,457 --> 01:07:42,448
...and you laughed at him anyway.

700
01:07:43,297 --> 01:07:45,333
But those motherfuckers...

701
01:07:45,497 --> 01:07:48,216
...they had to say that
he was depressed...

702
01:07:48,377 --> 01:07:51,813
...and he was suicidal,
and that he was fucked up.

703
01:07:51,977 --> 01:07:56,528
They wanted his fucking ass, man.
They wanted to nail his ass.

704
01:07:56,697 --> 01:08:00,656
Because he didn't think living
was such a happy trip, you know?

705
01:08:02,257 --> 01:08:05,647
We can't have happy people
walking on this planet.

706
01:08:05,817 --> 01:08:08,729
Everybody's gotta be
so goddamn serious.

707
01:08:08,897 --> 01:08:11,252
Everyone's gotta stay in business...

708
01:08:11,417 --> 01:08:15,729
...and suffer so the witch doctors
and the deodorant-spray people...

709
01:08:15,897 --> 01:08:19,014
...and plastic surgeons
could stay in business.

710
01:08:19,177 --> 01:08:22,931
And we can all go fucking pray
to the asshole God up there...

711
01:08:23,097 --> 01:08:26,009
...that fucked it up
in the first place!

712
01:08:30,457 --> 01:08:34,291
Does all this make you
realize anything about yourself?

713
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:37,967
-What?
-How does it affect you?

714
01:08:39,057 --> 01:08:41,287
How does it affect me?

715
01:08:42,257 --> 01:08:45,010
I'm here,
and I'm in this fucking school.

716
01:08:45,177 --> 01:08:48,089
And I'm fucking everybody back
for Freddie!

717
01:08:48,257 --> 01:08:50,009
Take it easy, Ralph.

718
01:08:50,177 --> 01:08:53,374
You want them laughing
with you, not at you.

719
01:08:53,697 --> 01:08:55,688
I don't want them laughing.

720
01:09:07,577 --> 01:09:09,090
Leroy?

721
01:09:09,777 --> 01:09:10,766
Ma'am?

722
01:09:11,257 --> 01:09:13,407
What are you wearing, Leroy?

723
01:09:13,817 --> 01:09:16,695
-A hat.
-On your feet, Leroy.

724
01:09:16,857 --> 01:09:20,850
Oh, those. You like them? They get me
to class quicker, get more learning in.

725
01:09:21,017 --> 01:09:23,736
-What about your book report?
-I done it.

726
01:09:23,897 --> 01:09:26,934
-You did it.
-1 000 words. I counted them too.

727
01:09:27,097 --> 01:09:30,453
-The Best of Playboy isn't a book report.
-It's reading, ain't it?

728
01:09:30,617 --> 01:09:35,372
So is 1984, Huckleberry Finn,
Great Expectations. You heard of those?

729
01:09:35,537 --> 01:09:37,334
I seen a couple of the movies.

730
01:09:37,497 --> 01:09:40,534
If you don't read,
you're missing so much.

731
01:09:40,697 --> 01:09:46,249
-I don't like reading. It's not my style.
-Then try Othello. He's black.

732
01:09:46,497 --> 01:09:49,648
-1 000 words in two weeks.
-Or what?

733
01:09:49,817 --> 01:09:53,446
Or you'll skate right out of
this school, Mr. Johnson.

734
01:10:09,297 --> 01:10:10,969
Come in.

735
01:10:12,857 --> 01:10:16,850
-Miss Berg, you wanted to see me?
-Come and sit down, Lisa.

736
01:10:22,937 --> 01:10:25,576
You're not working hard enough, Lisa.

737
01:10:26,057 --> 01:10:28,696
Well, I've been sick.

738
01:10:29,057 --> 01:10:31,412
Dancers don't get sick.

739
01:10:32,097 --> 01:10:33,815
Well, my doctor told me...

740
01:10:33,977 --> 01:10:37,492
...to take it easy
for a week or two until I feel okay.

741
01:10:37,657 --> 01:10:41,775
-So now it's the doctor's fault?
-Don't you believe me?

742
01:10:41,937 --> 01:10:43,370
I believe you, Lisa.

743
01:10:43,577 --> 01:10:47,286
But I don't have room
for you in this class anymore.

744
01:10:47,457 --> 01:10:49,766
But I brought a doctor's note.

745
01:10:49,937 --> 01:10:53,646
There are too many other girls
who take dance seriously...

746
01:10:53,817 --> 01:10:56,968
...to waste time and space
on someone who isn't dedicated.

747
01:10:57,137 --> 01:11:01,130
-But I am dedicated.
-I'm sorry, Lisa. I don't see it.

748
01:11:01,937 --> 01:11:04,531
I got into this school, didn't l?

749
01:11:04,697 --> 01:11:08,212
We made a mistake.
Sometimes it just doesn't work out.

750
01:11:08,377 --> 01:11:11,449
-You'll get over it.
-I'll work harder.

751
01:11:11,617 --> 01:11:14,290
-Maybe.
-I promise I'll be better.

752
01:11:14,457 --> 01:11:16,527
Better isn't good enough.

753
01:11:16,697 --> 01:11:20,815
I don't think you'll ever
be good enough. You don't have it.

754
01:11:20,977 --> 01:11:26,051
That's a hard thing to hear, and it's not
pleasant to say, but it's the truth.

755
01:11:26,217 --> 01:11:29,926
I'm saving you a lot of time and pain
by saying it now.

756
01:11:30,417 --> 01:11:33,090
I don't wanna be the best.

757
01:11:33,817 --> 01:11:36,854
-Well, you won't be.
-I just wanna dance.

758
01:11:38,137 --> 01:11:43,165
-Well, you'll never be a Mikhail, Lisa.
-I can't fail, Miss Berg.

759
01:11:43,337 --> 01:11:47,410
-I only ever wanted to be a dancer.
-You'll get over it.

760
01:11:47,577 --> 01:11:52,571
-What do I tell my mother?
-Have her call me and I'll explain.

761
01:13:18,057 --> 01:13:21,652
Fuck it. If I can't dance,
I'll change to the drama department.

762
01:13:22,137 --> 01:13:25,334
I tell you,
you're a fucking good actress.

763
01:13:31,697 --> 01:13:34,928
I heard the bitch came down
on her real hard.

764
01:13:35,097 --> 01:13:38,567
-So? Life comes down hard.
-She just took a real bad dump, kid.

765
01:13:40,537 --> 01:13:44,530
Better she realizes it now
than OD in some motel room at 30.

766
01:13:44,697 --> 01:13:47,336
You might show
a little more sympathy, dear.

767
01:13:47,657 --> 01:13:50,649
-I'm not "dear. "
-Evidemment.

768
01:13:50,817 --> 01:13:53,047
You're not très sensitive either.

769
01:13:53,337 --> 01:13:54,531
I'm a professional.

770
01:13:54,697 --> 01:13:58,246
A few unkind words aren't
going to bother me none.

771
01:13:58,737 --> 01:14:03,253
-I know it won't all be standing ovations.
-Certainly not for you, my dear.

772
01:14:03,897 --> 01:14:06,286
Look, I'm not "my dear. "
You can fuck "my dear. "

773
01:14:06,457 --> 01:14:10,530
Well, thank you. That might be fun.

774
01:14:13,297 --> 01:14:17,415
And that might be impossible.
He's not into vanilla.

775
01:14:17,577 --> 01:14:19,533
Might be a nice change
from black cherry.

776
01:14:19,697 --> 01:14:22,928
The darker the berry,
the sweeter the juice, honey.

777
01:14:23,097 --> 01:14:26,567
Yes, but who wants diabetes?

778
01:14:30,897 --> 01:14:34,287
I mean, you don't understand.
Listen to me, man.

779
01:14:34,457 --> 01:14:37,813
Diction. Watch your diction, Ralph.
You're slurring your words.

780
01:14:37,977 --> 01:14:42,607
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Marlon Brando slurred his words.

781
01:14:42,777 --> 01:14:45,928
Montgomery Clift and
James Dean slurred their words.

782
01:14:46,097 --> 01:14:50,056
They were the greatest actors in the
world. Nobody could understand them.

783
01:14:51,217 --> 01:14:53,447
Wait a second. What's so funny?

784
01:15:04,377 --> 01:15:08,131
Hey, it's Raul.
Where's my two chicks, huh?

785
01:15:15,417 --> 01:15:19,012
Look at you! You got so big!
Where is Mom? ls she home?

786
01:15:46,977 --> 01:15:49,127
Hey, cupcake. Come here, cupcake.

787
01:15:49,297 --> 01:15:52,972
Faggot.
That's what you are now, man.

788
01:15:53,337 --> 01:15:56,135
What you doing? Whoa! Damn, man.

789
01:16:38,897 --> 01:16:42,094
Martelli! Bruno Martelli!

790
01:16:44,777 --> 01:16:46,415
Shit!

791
01:16:51,897 --> 01:16:55,253
In the beginning
she's not in love with him--

792
01:16:55,417 --> 01:16:57,487
-God, you live here, Montgomery?
-Yeah.

793
01:16:57,657 --> 01:17:00,012
-This is a great pad.
-You like it?

794
01:17:00,177 --> 01:17:03,567
It's great. What happened to all
your furniture? You get ripped off?

795
01:17:03,737 --> 01:17:06,251
-It closed in Cincinnati.
-What's that mean?

796
01:17:06,417 --> 01:17:09,807
My mom kept saying she was gonna
fix it up when she got into a long run.

797
01:17:09,977 --> 01:17:12,537
-She's got a lousy choice in plays.
-It's perfect.

798
01:17:12,697 --> 01:17:17,168
We don't need nothing for rehearsal.
Ready when you are, Mr. Director.

799
01:17:17,337 --> 01:17:21,649
-All right, page one, Act 1 .
-All right, page one, Act 1 .

800
01:17:54,937 --> 01:17:57,132
Raul?

801
01:18:21,977 --> 01:18:24,047
Raul?

802
01:18:37,817 --> 01:18:42,288
If you're kicked around long enough,
you get to be a real professor of pain.

803
01:18:42,457 --> 01:18:46,211
I know how you feel.
But I'm having a real good time now.

804
01:18:46,377 --> 01:18:47,890
I'm enjoying myself.

805
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:50,935
So you see, you're not such
a dog as you think you are.

806
01:18:51,097 --> 01:18:53,167
I'm having a very good time too.

807
01:18:53,337 --> 01:18:57,012
So there you are. I'm not such a dog
as I think I am.

808
01:18:57,177 --> 01:18:59,247
I think you're a very nice guy.

809
01:18:59,417 --> 01:19:02,807
I don't know why
a girl hasn't grabbed you.

810
01:19:02,977 --> 01:19:07,289
Yeah, I don't either. I am a nice guy.

811
01:19:07,537 --> 01:19:10,256
I'm also a real smart guy too.

812
01:19:18,057 --> 01:19:22,289
Wait. There's a whole speech yet.
You're not supposed to kiss yet.

813
01:19:24,937 --> 01:19:29,488
Ralph. Doris. Ralph, you have a whole
speech here you haven't even done.

814
01:19:29,657 --> 01:19:32,330
Ralph, you're not supposed to kiss yet.

815
01:19:39,257 --> 01:19:41,976
My mother was French
and very beautiful.

816
01:19:42,137 --> 01:19:47,575
Straight out of some chateau.
She danced every night for hours.

817
01:19:47,737 --> 01:19:51,571
Daddy was in Washington
or out to dinner with clients...

818
01:19:51,737 --> 01:19:55,093
...while Mom was with Tchaikovsky,
Ravel, Mantovani.

819
01:19:55,257 --> 01:19:58,806
You'll meet my stepmother, Claudia.
Trainee witch.

820
01:19:58,977 --> 01:20:02,447
No cracks about being Chinese.
She's had her eyes fixed.

821
01:20:02,617 --> 01:20:05,973
She recuperated in Palm Springs,
where she had her purse stolen.

822
01:20:06,137 --> 01:20:08,776
She lost all her credit cards.

823
01:20:09,297 --> 01:20:13,768
Dad doesn't want to report it, though.
The thief is spending less than she did.

824
01:20:21,217 --> 01:20:23,048
Hi, Daddy.

825
01:20:24,697 --> 01:20:26,016
Hi.

826
01:20:26,617 --> 01:20:29,654
Oh, this is Leroy. Homework.

827
01:23:39,497 --> 01:23:42,853
That was nice. Really.

828
01:23:43,257 --> 01:23:45,896
Sentimental shit.

829
01:23:46,777 --> 01:23:49,166
That was beautiful!

830
01:23:50,297 --> 01:23:53,334
That was beautiful.

831
01:23:53,697 --> 01:23:55,847
It was beautiful.

832
01:24:03,177 --> 01:24:06,613
-Yeah, this is it here.
-You live here?

833
01:24:06,777 --> 01:24:09,496
My sister lives here.
I'm always welcome.

834
01:24:09,657 --> 01:24:11,136
-Very nice place.
-Yeah.

835
01:24:11,297 --> 01:24:15,085
They're very fancy, huh?
I'll wait till you get inside.

836
01:24:15,257 --> 01:24:17,373
No. It's okay. Really.

837
01:24:17,537 --> 01:24:19,767
-Okay.
-It's a good neighborhood.

838
01:24:19,937 --> 01:24:24,010
-It's not much, but--
-Please, come on. That's not necessary.

839
01:24:24,177 --> 01:24:25,576
I should pay you.

840
01:24:25,737 --> 01:24:29,889
You know, I play your tapes
for my customers, you know.

841
01:24:30,057 --> 01:24:35,370
They love that stuff.
My tips go up 20%, at least.

842
01:24:36,217 --> 01:24:39,892
-And my son is happy.
-He's writing some good shit too.

843
01:24:40,057 --> 01:24:43,572
We're gonna be all over the charts
one of these days.

844
01:24:43,737 --> 01:24:48,174
-You make him happy, you know that?
-We're a hot team, you know.

845
01:24:48,337 --> 01:24:52,853
-You make him hotter. You know?
-Sure.

846
01:24:53,017 --> 01:24:57,727
I seem to have that effect on people.
What can I do? Thanks again.

847
01:24:57,897 --> 01:25:00,365
-Good night, Bruno.
-Night. Take it easy.

848
01:26:22,857 --> 01:26:24,290
You're crazy.

849
01:26:24,697 --> 01:26:25,812
You call a doctor?

850
01:26:26,137 --> 01:26:27,252
I don't think she's hurt.

851
01:26:27,537 --> 01:26:29,573
Since when are you
in the thinking business?

852
01:26:29,937 --> 01:26:31,052
She's frightened.

853
01:26:31,337 --> 01:26:34,454
-She's 5 fucking years old!
-Please keep your voice down.

854
01:26:36,377 --> 01:26:39,767
-You're in a church, my son.
-You're in the Dark Ages!

855
01:26:40,697 --> 01:26:42,369
You kiss my ass, Padre.

856
01:26:43,017 --> 01:26:47,533
She needs a doctor! A doctor!
Not the goddamn Holy Ghost!

857
01:27:11,297 --> 01:27:13,288
Is she all right?

858
01:27:17,297 --> 01:27:20,050
You're not attacked by a creep
at 5 years old and all right.

859
01:27:20,497 --> 01:27:22,089
I'm sorry.

860
01:27:22,377 --> 01:27:25,016
Doris, I wasn't there!
I wasn't fucking there!

861
01:27:25,457 --> 01:27:26,572
What about your father?

862
01:27:27,097 --> 01:27:29,327
I happen to be between
fathers right now.

863
01:27:29,497 --> 01:27:30,771
What does that mean?

864
01:27:31,417 --> 01:27:33,408
You got to understand something.

865
01:27:33,977 --> 01:27:36,810
You got to understand
the Puerto Rican woman.

866
01:27:38,537 --> 01:27:40,209
She thinks about
the kids...

867
01:27:40,377 --> 01:27:44,336
...how they gotta have a father.
Love has nothing to do with it.

868
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:47,327
My mom has an extra room.
She rents it out.

869
01:27:47,497 --> 01:27:50,295
Next thing you know,
I've got a new father.

870
01:27:55,897 --> 01:27:59,207
They're all right, mostly.
They may stay a day...

871
01:27:59,657 --> 01:28:02,490
...or a week or a month,
if we're lucky.

872
01:28:03,137 --> 01:28:05,332
Sometimes they even pay the rent.

873
01:28:07,417 --> 01:28:09,169
They keep out all the rats.

874
01:28:10,017 --> 01:28:12,895
Not animal-type rats.
I'm talking about real rats...

875
01:28:13,057 --> 01:28:14,695
...the junkies and the winos...

876
01:28:14,857 --> 01:28:18,247
...and the shitheads
and the people who beat up...

877
01:28:21,937 --> 01:28:24,405
...Iittle 5-year-old kids.

878
01:28:27,977 --> 01:28:29,933
I got three sisters, see?

879
01:28:31,617 --> 01:28:35,530
One of them, Maria, she's
in kind of a special place.

880
01:28:36,777 --> 01:28:40,656
We see her a couple times a year.
She's got a birth defect.

881
01:28:43,657 --> 01:28:46,330
That's a goddamn lie.

882
01:28:47,977 --> 01:28:50,537
That's a goddamn lie!

883
01:28:52,137 --> 01:28:54,776
Want to know about my father?
My first fucking father?

884
01:28:54,937 --> 01:28:57,007
He ain't no special shit.

885
01:28:58,297 --> 01:29:01,653
He's in New York State Penitentiary.
He's doing time.

886
01:29:02,897 --> 01:29:05,809
I remember this one night
he got bothered...

887
01:29:05,977 --> 01:29:09,333
...because I was making her laugh.
I was telling her stories.

888
01:29:09,777 --> 01:29:13,167
It was just kid stuff.
Flying carpets and dragons.

889
01:29:13,337 --> 01:29:16,295
And he got mad
because she was laughing!

890
01:29:16,857 --> 01:29:19,325
And he said I was telling her lies.

891
01:29:19,617 --> 01:29:21,130
And this one night...

892
01:29:22,377 --> 01:29:24,015
...he got bothered.

893
01:29:25,177 --> 01:29:27,486
He's beating me
and coming down on me...

894
01:29:27,657 --> 01:29:29,090
...I said, "I make her laugh. "

895
01:29:29,257 --> 01:29:32,294
That's not a lie, that's a gift,
goddamn it.

896
01:29:33,497 --> 01:29:35,533
He can't do it.

897
01:29:36,697 --> 01:29:40,815
He said if he can't do it,
he sure as shit's gonna stop it.

898
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:44,686
And he went for me, and...

899
01:29:45,537 --> 01:29:48,370
...she got in the way
all of a sudden, and...

900
01:29:49,897 --> 01:29:52,491
...he put her head inside a fucking wall.

901
01:29:53,337 --> 01:29:56,488
If it was my fucking head,
it would've been all right...

902
01:29:56,657 --> 01:29:58,773
...but it wasn't. It was hers!

903
01:29:59,097 --> 01:30:03,090
If it was my fucking fat head,
it would've been all right.

904
01:30:04,697 --> 01:30:07,894
She's a beautiful kid.
She's 5 fucking years old.

905
01:30:08,137 --> 01:30:13,006
She's got a pretty little laugh.
She still laughs, as a matter of fact.

906
01:31:12,337 --> 01:31:14,407
Barbra Streisand didn't
change her name.

907
01:31:14,617 --> 01:31:18,132
-I don't want to talk about it.
-I'll call you Doris, like always.

908
01:31:18,297 --> 01:31:19,412
I won't answer.

909
01:31:19,577 --> 01:31:23,252
-It's a perfectly good name.
-For a perfectly good person.

910
01:31:23,417 --> 01:31:26,727
A skinny, boring, nondescript,
perfectly good person.

911
01:31:27,057 --> 01:31:32,211
I have a lot of friends named Doris,
and they are none of those things.

912
01:31:32,457 --> 01:31:34,527
-Yeah, but they're all--
-What?

913
01:31:34,777 --> 01:31:36,847
No, no, no. Say it. Go ahead. Say it!

914
01:31:37,017 --> 01:31:41,249
I would like to know what my daughter
thinks is wrong with my friends.

915
01:31:41,417 --> 01:31:44,807
I don't want a middle-aged name.
I can't relate to it.

916
01:31:45,097 --> 01:31:46,530
You can call me Dominique.

917
01:31:46,697 --> 01:31:47,812
Dominique.

918
01:31:47,977 --> 01:31:50,207
-That's ridiculous.
-It's French.

919
01:31:50,377 --> 01:31:54,655
-I know what it is, but it's not you.
-I'll grow into it.

920
01:31:54,937 --> 01:31:58,247
-Dominique Finsecker?
-No. Dominique Dupont.

921
01:31:58,817 --> 01:32:00,853
-Sounds like a hooker.
-Oh, Mama.

922
01:32:01,017 --> 01:32:04,771
I don't know what's happening to you.
Tell me what's happening to you.

923
01:32:05,177 --> 01:32:07,247
Where did my Doris go?

924
01:32:07,577 --> 01:32:11,411
Something wonderful is happening
to me, Mama. I'm growing up.

925
01:32:12,577 --> 01:32:14,693
You're becoming somebody else.

926
01:32:14,977 --> 01:32:19,209
-I'm becoming an actress.
-I want you to be the Doris that I know.

927
01:32:19,377 --> 01:32:22,210
That I love. That helps
me with the groceries.

928
01:32:23,137 --> 01:32:25,093
Makes me birthday cards...

929
01:32:25,257 --> 01:32:27,566
...out of Cheerio packets, huh?

930
01:32:28,177 --> 01:32:29,576
Not Dominique...

931
01:32:29,897 --> 01:32:31,853
...who stays out all night.

932
01:32:32,017 --> 01:32:33,336
Oh, Mama.

933
01:32:33,537 --> 01:32:35,255
And gets pregnant.

934
01:32:35,737 --> 01:32:38,012
Or has an abortion, God forbid.

935
01:32:39,737 --> 01:32:42,809
Now, Dominique, she'd be smart.

936
01:32:43,697 --> 01:32:45,335
But my Doris...

937
01:32:45,857 --> 01:32:47,813
...she's dumb enough
to get knocked up--

938
01:32:48,177 --> 01:32:50,372
Mama, it was just one night!

939
01:32:52,217 --> 01:32:53,775
That's all it takes.

940
01:33:04,737 --> 01:33:07,968
We'd like to welcome everyone to
The Rocky Horror Picture Show...

941
01:33:08,137 --> 01:33:10,446
...here at the 8th Street Playhouse!

942
01:33:15,417 --> 01:33:18,295
And our regulars would
like to wish a warm welcome...

943
01:33:18,457 --> 01:33:20,846
...to all you virgins!

944
01:33:24,417 --> 01:33:27,056
We have some special occasions tonight.

945
01:33:27,417 --> 01:33:29,885
Tonight is Gail's birthday.

946
01:33:33,977 --> 01:33:37,811
We have a special button
for a special young lady.

947
01:33:37,977 --> 01:33:42,016
Tonight is Christine's 1 50th time!

948
01:33:52,497 --> 01:33:54,453
Let's hear it for her! Come on!

949
01:34:00,857 --> 01:34:03,815
Now, we have a special warning
from the management.

950
01:34:03,977 --> 01:34:06,889
No lit candles. No throwing
food at the screen. Understand?

951
01:34:07,137 --> 01:34:08,365
Get on with the show!

952
01:34:08,897 --> 01:34:11,411
This is the fucking show!
lf you don't like it...

953
01:34:11,577 --> 01:34:13,807
...you can go see the movie
in Staten lsland!

954
01:34:13,977 --> 01:34:17,014
Boy, is he in for a surprise tonight.

955
01:34:17,377 --> 01:34:18,969
All right, for the cheers!

956
01:34:19,137 --> 01:34:20,809
-Give me an R!
-R!

957
01:34:21,057 --> 01:34:22,536
-Give me an O!
-O!

958
01:34:22,737 --> 01:34:24,056
-Give me a C!
-C!

959
01:34:24,217 --> 01:34:26,014
-Give me a K!
-K!

960
01:34:26,177 --> 01:34:27,496
-Give me a Y!
-Y!

961
01:34:27,737 --> 01:34:29,295
-What's it spell?
-Rocky!

962
01:34:29,457 --> 01:34:31,573
-I can't hear you!
-Rocky!

963
01:34:31,817 --> 01:34:33,808
-One more time!
-Rocky!

964
01:34:33,977 --> 01:34:35,046
-Give me an E!
-E!

965
01:34:35,217 --> 01:34:36,696
-Give me an A!
-A!

966
01:34:36,857 --> 01:34:39,496
-What kind of time we gonna have?
-E-A!

967
01:36:46,857 --> 01:36:49,007
Where did that
motorcyclist come from?

968
01:36:49,177 --> 01:36:50,849
I guess we'll have to turn back.

969
01:36:57,137 --> 01:36:59,890
-What was that bang?
-Must have a blowout.

970
01:37:00,457 --> 01:37:01,731
Damn it!

971
01:37:01,897 --> 01:37:05,810
-I should have gotten that spare fixed.
-Asshole!

972
01:37:05,977 --> 01:37:08,127
Stay here and keep warm.
I'll go for help.

973
01:37:08,297 --> 01:37:10,606
Where will you go
in the middle of nowhere?

974
01:37:10,777 --> 01:37:14,133
What's white and sells hamburgers?

975
01:37:14,297 --> 01:37:17,175
Didn 't we pass a castle down the road?

976
01:37:17,457 --> 01:37:19,448
Maybe they have a telephone.

977
01:37:19,617 --> 01:37:21,175
I'm going with you.

978
01:37:25,497 --> 01:37:27,647
Kick it!

979
01:37:31,577 --> 01:37:36,207
Hey, Janet! How about fries
to go with that shake?

980
01:37:40,257 --> 01:37:42,691
Take the risk!

981
01:37:49,337 --> 01:37:52,852
Hey, Riff, show us your mother!

982
01:38:10,137 --> 01:38:11,855
Watch the film.

983
01:38:41,777 --> 01:38:43,927
How's it go?

984
01:38:59,937 --> 01:39:02,007
Oh, my God.

985
01:39:11,337 --> 01:39:13,248
-You did what?
-I got stoned.

986
01:39:13,937 --> 01:39:16,212
She took her top off.
She played with her bongos.

987
01:39:16,657 --> 01:39:18,613
-I did not!
-It was incredible!

988
01:39:18,777 --> 01:39:20,733
It was more than incredible, it was fun.

989
01:39:20,897 --> 01:39:24,492
I felt naked when people looked at me
before. But they weren't looking at me...

990
01:39:24,657 --> 01:39:27,649
...they were looking at someone
I put on. Like a costume.

991
01:39:28,017 --> 01:39:32,374
If I don't have a personality, so what?
I'm an actress.

992
01:39:32,577 --> 01:39:35,091
I can put on
as many personalities as I want.

993
01:39:35,257 --> 01:39:37,896
-To schizophrenia!
-Abso-fucking-lutely!

994
01:39:38,257 --> 01:39:41,852
-Abso-fucking-what?
-You kids ready to order now?

995
01:39:42,457 --> 01:39:44,175
-Michael?
-Yeah.

996
01:39:44,697 --> 01:39:46,335
You don't remember?

997
01:39:46,937 --> 01:39:49,007
Two years ago. I'm Doris Fin--

998
01:39:49,177 --> 01:39:52,692
I was Doris Finsecker, when
you were a senior at P.A.

999
01:39:53,217 --> 01:39:57,051
-Yeah. Around the corner.
-You remember Montgomery MacNeil...

1000
01:39:57,217 --> 01:39:59,412
-...and Ralph Garci.
-Sure. Good old days.

1001
01:39:59,977 --> 01:40:00,966
How was Hollywood?

1002
01:40:01,417 --> 01:40:02,532
Slow.

1003
01:40:02,777 --> 01:40:05,496
I met some people,
went to some parties.

1004
01:40:05,897 --> 01:40:09,173
-I did a pilot for a series.
-I didn't see it.

1005
01:40:09,377 --> 01:40:10,776
Nobody saw it.

1006
01:40:11,137 --> 01:40:12,206
Sorry.

1007
01:40:12,857 --> 01:40:16,054
-I did a couple of days as a male nurse.
-Did you?

1008
01:40:16,377 --> 01:40:18,174
On a soap.

1009
01:40:19,097 --> 01:40:21,657
-I didn't like L.A. too much.
-It sucks out there.

1010
01:40:22,017 --> 01:40:25,407
-Are you studying?
-I catch a class when I can.

1011
01:40:25,577 --> 01:40:27,215
Hard times, you know?

1012
01:40:28,057 --> 01:40:30,491
-I read for a showcase.
-Oh, really?

1013
01:40:30,657 --> 01:40:32,534
I got a callback next week.

1014
01:40:32,857 --> 01:40:34,609
-Hope you get it.
-Hey, good luck.

1015
01:40:34,977 --> 01:40:36,012
Yeah.

1016
01:40:36,577 --> 01:40:37,646
Yeah.

1017
01:40:39,417 --> 01:40:40,736
What you kids having?

1018
01:40:41,017 --> 01:40:43,212
Got a special today on fried clams.

1019
01:40:43,497 --> 01:40:46,614
-Fried clams sound great.
-Yeah, that's fine.

1020
01:40:47,497 --> 01:40:51,172
-Fried clams is great.
-Yeah, sounds good.

1021
01:40:55,257 --> 01:40:57,248
Welcome to Catch a Rising Star.

1022
01:40:58,537 --> 01:41:00,846
Did anybody know it was Monday night?

1023
01:41:01,137 --> 01:41:04,732
Monday night is audition night.
Anybody from anywhere...

1024
01:41:04,897 --> 01:41:06,967
...can come up here and do
what they want.

1025
01:41:07,137 --> 01:41:09,571
You should see what walks in the room.

1026
01:41:09,737 --> 01:41:12,854
Some of the people that started here
were David Brenner...

1027
01:41:13,017 --> 01:41:14,166
...Jimmie Walker...

1028
01:41:14,377 --> 01:41:18,655
...Gabe Kaplan, Freddie Prinze.
Maybe this next young man might...

1029
01:41:19,057 --> 01:41:20,695
...watch them on television.

1030
01:41:21,337 --> 01:41:24,727
Please welcome the comedy stylings...

1031
01:41:24,977 --> 01:41:27,855
...of Ralph Garci, ladies and gentlemen.

1032
01:41:32,497 --> 01:41:34,567
Yay, Ralph!

1033
01:41:35,377 --> 01:41:36,366
Thank you.

1034
01:41:37,097 --> 01:41:39,895
Like Richard said,
my name is Ralph Garci.

1035
01:41:40,057 --> 01:41:41,854
I'm a professional asshole.

1036
01:41:45,057 --> 01:41:48,367
I see we have a few
amateurs in the audience.

1037
01:41:49,977 --> 01:41:51,046
I have some--

1038
01:41:51,217 --> 01:41:55,733
Some. I have all of my friends here
tonight. From P.A. graduating class.

1039
01:42:00,017 --> 01:42:02,406
It's very important to have friends.

1040
01:42:03,177 --> 01:42:04,849
I live in the South Bronx.

1041
01:42:06,537 --> 01:42:09,973
That's the country just north of Harlem
and west of Puerto Rico.

1042
01:42:10,137 --> 01:42:12,173
It's a very tough neighborhood.

1043
01:42:12,337 --> 01:42:13,929
The dogs carry knives.

1044
01:42:15,897 --> 01:42:18,616
Did you ever see a baby
with a zip gun?

1045
01:42:19,297 --> 01:42:23,575
You gotta have friends. You can't
alienate anybody up there. Nobody.

1046
01:42:23,737 --> 01:42:27,252
Black people, white people, Chicanos,
Puerto Ricans, cockroaches.

1047
01:42:27,817 --> 01:42:30,536
You gotta respect cockroaches.
They got a good union.

1048
01:42:30,897 --> 01:42:35,095
Last week, 1 5,000 marched down my
block demanding better housing.

1049
01:42:37,177 --> 01:42:40,852
But I love the South Bronx.
Everywhere you go from there is up.

1050
01:42:41,857 --> 01:42:46,487
Everybody has dreams in the
South Bronx. I had dreams.

1051
01:42:46,857 --> 01:42:50,213
Stop your average boy
on a South Bronx street...

1052
01:42:50,977 --> 01:42:53,286
...and ask him
what he wants to be.

1053
01:42:53,657 --> 01:42:56,649
"I want to be an ex-junkie, man. "

1054
01:42:57,697 --> 01:42:59,494
You can see them every day.

1055
01:42:59,657 --> 01:43:03,809
You can't drive because of the dreams
on the streets being seen by cokeheads.

1056
01:43:03,977 --> 01:43:08,812
The minute that white line's laid down
the street, you got somebody going:

1057
01:43:09,977 --> 01:43:11,046
It's true.

1058
01:43:12,537 --> 01:43:15,097
And then there is sex.

1059
01:43:16,217 --> 01:43:17,570
Oh, yeah.

1060
01:43:17,937 --> 01:43:20,531
Kids are into sex earlier in South Bronx.

1061
01:43:21,497 --> 01:43:23,089
Like about 6 a.m.

1062
01:43:27,337 --> 01:43:28,895
-You were wonderful.
-No.

1063
01:43:29,057 --> 01:43:31,890
-Really.
-I was good. I felt more than good.

1064
01:43:32,057 --> 01:43:34,048
-The guy wants me back.
-You're kidding!

1065
01:43:34,217 --> 01:43:35,855
He wants to book me regularly.

1066
01:43:36,017 --> 01:43:37,370
-Great!
-That's not great...

1067
01:43:37,537 --> 01:43:39,607
...it's fantastic! It's like electricity.

1068
01:43:39,777 --> 01:43:43,213
You're out there. Those faces are
out there, staring at you...

1069
01:43:43,377 --> 01:43:46,653
...and you draw them in, then
you hit them with the juice.

1070
01:43:46,817 --> 01:43:50,856
And bam! They fucking explode!
And that power goes back and forth.

1071
01:43:51,017 --> 01:43:53,406
Next thing you know,
you're making them laugh.

1072
01:43:53,577 --> 01:43:57,047
That is the meanest high there is.
That beats dope. That beats sex.

1073
01:43:57,457 --> 01:44:00,574
I love fucking acting!

1074
01:44:00,777 --> 01:44:04,133
With my money, we can get
a place. We can get married maybe.

1075
01:44:04,297 --> 01:44:08,370
I'll have $20,000 a week, a hit
TV series, my face on TV Guide!

1076
01:44:08,537 --> 01:44:09,606
-Wait!
-What?

1077
01:44:09,777 --> 01:44:13,372
-What about me? Don't I get a career?
-A career? I'll give you a career.

1078
01:44:13,577 --> 01:44:18,526
How about Shakespeare in the Park
and you get to win 1 7 Tony awards?

1079
01:44:18,777 --> 01:44:21,575
-All right. Bye.
-All right. Okay. Bye.

1080
01:44:23,257 --> 01:44:24,849
Don't mug anybody.

1081
01:44:25,297 --> 01:44:28,209
-Don't rape anybody.
-I'll rape you.

1082
01:44:28,377 --> 01:44:29,696
Don't rape anybody, okay?

1083
01:44:29,857 --> 01:44:31,415
I'll see you later. Take care.

1084
01:44:36,377 --> 01:44:37,571
You see...

1085
01:44:38,737 --> 01:44:41,968
...I've been offered this place
with the San Francisco Ballet.

1086
01:44:42,137 --> 01:44:45,095
I haven't told anyone yet,
but I'm gonna take it.

1087
01:44:45,257 --> 01:44:47,293
I don't care what they think.

1088
01:44:47,857 --> 01:44:50,166
I'm a good dancer. Better than good.

1089
01:44:50,417 --> 01:44:52,772
Maybe even the best in the school.

1090
01:44:53,617 --> 01:44:56,893
That's not conceit.
It's just simple honesty.

1091
01:44:58,017 --> 01:45:02,374
If I stay in New York, everybody will
think I bought my way into ABT.

1092
01:45:02,657 --> 01:45:07,572
I'm not starving myself to death
for Balanchine's City Ballet.

1093
01:45:08,697 --> 01:45:11,973
Not that I mind doing
the corps de ballet bullshit.

1094
01:45:12,537 --> 01:45:14,926
I'd sooner do it out of town.

1095
01:45:16,497 --> 01:45:18,965
I'll pay my dues on the West Coast.

1096
01:45:19,777 --> 01:45:22,450
Come back to New York as a star.

1097
01:45:25,137 --> 01:45:26,286
You see...

1098
01:45:27,097 --> 01:45:29,565
...I've always had this crazy dream...

1099
01:45:29,737 --> 01:45:33,332
...of dancing all the classical
roles before I'm 21 .

1100
01:45:34,937 --> 01:45:38,771
I want Giselles and Coppélias
coming out of my feet.

1101
01:45:39,297 --> 01:45:41,253
And Sleeping Beauties...

1102
01:45:41,697 --> 01:45:43,608
...and the Swan.

1103
01:45:45,177 --> 01:45:48,089
I want bravos in Stuttgart
and Leningrad...

1104
01:45:48,257 --> 01:45:49,770
...and Paris.

1105
01:45:50,977 --> 01:45:54,287
Maybe even a ballet
created especially for me.

1106
01:45:57,497 --> 01:45:58,930
You see...

1107
01:45:59,577 --> 01:46:02,296
...there's no room for a baby.

1108
01:46:03,217 --> 01:46:06,607
Will this be Master Charge
or American Express, honey?

1109
01:46:15,057 --> 01:46:16,285
Excuse me.

1110
01:46:17,497 --> 01:46:19,169
You're an actress, aren't you?

1111
01:46:19,537 --> 01:46:20,856
I might be.

1112
01:46:21,657 --> 01:46:23,409
A Chorus Line, right?

1113
01:46:23,817 --> 01:46:27,366
Aren't you the one that does that
hot, smoky number in the red dress?

1114
01:46:27,897 --> 01:46:30,570
I'm right, ain't l? I knew it.

1115
01:46:31,097 --> 01:46:34,851
Boy, let me tell you, you are
the best thing in that show.

1116
01:46:36,417 --> 01:46:40,012
I guess you get tired of hearing that.
Excuse me.

1117
01:46:40,177 --> 01:46:41,656
No, I don't.

1118
01:46:43,097 --> 01:46:44,815
You don't belong there.

1119
01:46:45,137 --> 01:46:47,412
If you don't mind my
saying so, you're a star.

1120
01:46:47,577 --> 01:46:49,295
You need a show all to yourself.

1121
01:46:49,497 --> 01:46:53,649
-You've got a lovely face, a great figure.
-I sing too.

1122
01:46:53,817 --> 01:46:55,250
-No.
-And play the piano.

1123
01:46:55,537 --> 01:46:58,176
That's what I mean. But it's
more than just talent...

1124
01:46:58,337 --> 01:47:00,328
...it's a certain quality.

1125
01:47:00,537 --> 01:47:03,370
You're the kind of girl that
stands out in a room.

1126
01:47:03,577 --> 01:47:06,489
This might sound a little
presumptuous of me... .

1127
01:47:07,297 --> 01:47:09,288
I should probably
just call your agent.

1128
01:47:09,897 --> 01:47:14,015
-I don't really relate to agents.
-Don't blame you at all.

1129
01:47:14,257 --> 01:47:17,488
Listen, my name is François.
Francois Lafete.

1130
01:47:17,857 --> 01:47:18,846
Coco.

1131
01:47:19,217 --> 01:47:22,334
Coco? Coco? That's terrific!

1132
01:47:22,617 --> 01:47:26,530
Listen, Coco, I'm doing this picture
down in the south of France, you know?

1133
01:47:27,217 --> 01:47:29,651
I was wondering if...

1134
01:47:30,457 --> 01:47:32,925
...maybe you'd like to do
a screen test for me.

1135
01:47:36,657 --> 01:47:38,056
Are you serious?

1136
01:47:44,377 --> 01:47:45,810
Bunsky.

1137
01:47:46,257 --> 01:47:47,610
Hey, Bunsky.

1138
01:47:48,657 --> 01:47:49,692
You seen Sherwood?

1139
01:47:49,897 --> 01:47:51,933
She's with her husband.

1140
01:47:52,097 --> 01:47:54,691
-I didn't know she had a husband.
-He's sick, Leroy.

1141
01:47:55,057 --> 01:47:56,775
He'd have to be to be her husband.

1142
01:47:56,937 --> 01:47:59,531
He's quite bad.
In the hospital, anyway.

1143
01:47:59,697 --> 01:48:01,494
-Hospital?
-Apparently.

1144
01:48:02,017 --> 01:48:03,609
Okay, Schlepstein.

1145
01:48:30,257 --> 01:48:32,293
Leroy. What are you doing here?

1146
01:48:35,497 --> 01:48:37,169
You ever heard of Alvin Ailey?

1147
01:48:37,377 --> 01:48:38,605
Alvin Ailey?

1148
01:48:39,097 --> 01:48:40,166
He's a... .

1149
01:48:40,777 --> 01:48:42,210
He's a choreographer?

1150
01:48:43,337 --> 01:48:45,168
He wants me to join his company.

1151
01:48:45,337 --> 01:48:48,693
I'm sorry, Leroy, but I don't think
this is the time--

1152
01:48:48,857 --> 01:48:51,496
I can't if you flunk me out.
I have to pass.

1153
01:48:51,737 --> 01:48:53,887
You should've thought of it
four years ago.

1154
01:48:54,057 --> 01:48:56,366
Where I come from
it don't pay to read and speak white.

1155
01:48:56,537 --> 01:48:58,334
Don't lecture me, Leroy.

1156
01:48:58,897 --> 01:49:02,651
Maybe I didn't say it right, but you
been down hard on me since day one.

1157
01:49:02,817 --> 01:49:04,967
Whatever you say,
Leroy. Go home.

1158
01:49:05,137 --> 01:49:08,209
I stopped going home!
You never knew that, did you?

1159
01:49:08,377 --> 01:49:12,575
You make a big deal about pulling us out
of the gutter, yet you won't eat with us.

1160
01:49:12,737 --> 01:49:15,297
You know where that leaves people
like me? Nowhere!

1161
01:49:15,457 --> 01:49:19,450
-It isn't the time. I don't wanna hear it.
-You're going to hear it!

1162
01:49:19,617 --> 01:49:23,371
-I'm gonna be a good dancer!
-Just get out of here, please!

1163
01:49:23,617 --> 01:49:26,529
-You will not keep me down...
-Leave me alone!

1164
01:49:26,697 --> 01:49:31,566
-...because I can't read stories!
-Don't you think of anyone but yourself?

1165
01:49:50,777 --> 01:49:51,766
Hey.

1166
01:49:52,417 --> 01:49:54,248
How's your old man doing?

1167
01:49:54,857 --> 01:49:55,846
Shit.

1168
01:50:00,257 --> 01:50:01,246
Here.

1169
01:50:03,097 --> 01:50:04,610
Thank you.

1170
01:51:04,457 --> 01:51:08,655
Coco. Bonjour. You made it. Come on in.

1171
01:51:11,857 --> 01:51:14,769
-Am I early?
-Don't be silly. Let me take your coat.

1172
01:51:15,257 --> 01:51:17,327
-Where's the crew?
-You're looking at him.

1173
01:51:17,537 --> 01:51:20,574
I must have total control of
the creative product.

1174
01:51:20,737 --> 01:51:22,090
Like Godard.

1175
01:51:22,897 --> 01:51:25,969
-Jean-Luc Godard? Ever hear of that guy?
-French?

1176
01:51:28,417 --> 01:51:30,726
-You ever see any of his pictures?
-Sure.

1177
01:51:30,897 --> 01:51:32,808
Then you know what I'm talking about.

1178
01:51:33,817 --> 01:51:38,095
You see, I belong, sort of, to the
auteur school of filmmaking.

1179
01:51:38,257 --> 01:51:39,736
It's like the--

1180
01:51:39,897 --> 01:51:43,128
It's like the Mediterranean
approach, you know what I mean?

1181
01:51:44,417 --> 01:51:46,726
-Do you want a beer?
-No, thanks. I'm okay.

1182
01:51:46,897 --> 01:51:50,412
-It might relax you.
-It's all right. I have a lot on my mind.

1183
01:51:50,577 --> 01:51:51,851
I understand.

1184
01:51:53,697 --> 01:51:55,449
-What?
-Come here.

1185
01:51:56,777 --> 01:52:00,008
That's it. I want you to sit right here.

1186
01:52:00,177 --> 01:52:04,932
We're gonna do a lovely close-up
of that beautiful face.

1187
01:52:05,897 --> 01:52:09,128
I get nervous at first with cold readings,
but then I'm all right.

1188
01:52:09,297 --> 01:52:12,334
Don't worry about that.
We'll get to the dialogue later.

1189
01:52:13,097 --> 01:52:17,613
-So, you like art movies, huh, Coco?
-Antonioni and those people? Sure.

1190
01:52:17,777 --> 01:52:20,086
It beats watching Laverne & Shirley.

1191
01:52:20,257 --> 01:52:23,408
Coco, you don't know
what you're doing to my lens.

1192
01:52:25,777 --> 01:52:27,972
You have a natural rapport
with the camera.

1193
01:52:28,137 --> 01:52:31,288
It's unbelievable. Some performers
can make love to the camera.

1194
01:52:31,457 --> 01:52:32,810
Garbo did.

1195
01:52:33,217 --> 01:52:34,730
Monroe did.

1196
01:52:36,057 --> 01:52:37,206
So could you.

1197
01:52:37,577 --> 01:52:39,533
-Yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

1198
01:52:39,937 --> 01:52:42,007
Could you take your top off, please?

1199
01:52:45,617 --> 01:52:48,609
-What?
-Could you take your blouse off?

1200
01:52:50,377 --> 01:52:52,572
-Are you kidding?
-No, I'm not kidding.

1201
01:52:53,657 --> 01:52:56,455
What's the matter?
You're acting like some dumb kid.

1202
01:52:56,617 --> 01:52:58,926
-I thought you were a professional.
-I am.

1203
01:52:59,097 --> 01:53:00,974
Well, then what's the problem?

1204
01:53:12,977 --> 01:53:14,695
I can't.

1205
01:53:24,377 --> 01:53:25,605
That's better.

1206
01:53:27,097 --> 01:53:28,496
That's lovely.

1207
01:53:30,257 --> 01:53:31,849
Oh, yeah.

1208
01:53:33,617 --> 01:53:37,530
Yeah. Could you arch your back?
Arch your back a little, Coco.

1209
01:53:40,977 --> 01:53:43,093
Smile for me, Coco.

1210
01:53:43,417 --> 01:53:48,127
Come on, Coco. Smile, smile.
Smile for me.

1211
01:53:49,257 --> 01:53:50,975
Now take your thumb...

1212
01:53:51,137 --> 01:53:52,775
...and put it in your mouth...

1213
01:53:52,937 --> 01:53:55,371
...Iike a little schoolgirl.

1214
01:53:57,857 --> 01:54:00,007
You ever notice that
black news reporters...

1215
01:54:00,177 --> 01:54:02,896
...get hired because
they have white accents?

1216
01:54:03,057 --> 01:54:06,288
They should hire a more natural guy,
a dude from the street.

1217
01:54:06,697 --> 01:54:08,210
"This is Rufus X with the news... . "

1218
01:54:10,537 --> 01:54:12,016
I need something.

1219
01:54:12,177 --> 01:54:13,451
Sleep.

1220
01:54:14,137 --> 01:54:16,605
-Something to keep me flying.
-Like what?

1221
01:54:17,017 --> 01:54:19,690
Like by way of your witch doctor.

1222
01:54:19,977 --> 01:54:22,252
I don't see Dr. Golden anymore.
You know that.

1223
01:54:22,737 --> 01:54:24,534
Anyway, you've been taking too much.

1224
01:54:24,697 --> 01:54:27,370
-Thanks, Marcus Welby.
-I know what I'm talking about.

1225
01:54:27,537 --> 01:54:29,812
Why don't you get off my fucking case?

1226
01:54:29,977 --> 01:54:32,650
-I'm your friend.
-You're my friend? Really?

1227
01:54:32,817 --> 01:54:36,332
I know what you've been
after, you goddamn faggot.

1228
01:54:40,337 --> 01:54:42,134
I gotta go to the bathroom.

1229
01:54:43,857 --> 01:54:45,495
Good. You do that.

1230
01:54:47,377 --> 01:54:48,856
Hi. You got a problem?

1231
01:54:49,457 --> 01:54:50,731
Yeah, I do.

1232
01:54:51,177 --> 01:54:52,929
We never see you anymore.

1233
01:54:53,177 --> 01:54:54,576
You see me plenty.

1234
01:54:54,737 --> 01:54:57,126
Drinking with your new friends
after the show.

1235
01:54:57,297 --> 01:55:00,414
After the show is when
all the big names come in.

1236
01:55:00,577 --> 01:55:02,693
You meet people. That's what counts.

1237
01:55:02,857 --> 01:55:05,610
I hate drinking. I'm doing this
for my future. For our future.

1238
01:55:05,777 --> 01:55:08,894
You're doing this for some image,
for Freddie because he did it.

1239
01:55:09,057 --> 01:55:11,366
-Yeah? Maybe.
-Yeah? Well, he died doing it.

1240
01:55:11,657 --> 01:55:13,727
-He could have been a real actor.
-He was!

1241
01:55:13,897 --> 01:55:17,492
He was funny and charming
and he made people laugh. That's it.

1242
01:55:17,657 --> 01:55:20,967
-That's plenty!
-That's not enough! Not for you!

1243
01:55:21,137 --> 01:55:22,889
-Jesus Christ!
-You are good, Ralph.

1244
01:55:23,057 --> 01:55:25,446
-You're seriously really good.
-Jesus.

1245
01:55:25,617 --> 01:55:30,247
You're full of rage and pain and love.
Not just jokes. You're an original.

1246
01:55:30,417 --> 01:55:32,248
The original Ralph Garci.

1247
01:55:32,497 --> 01:55:36,012
-You don't have to be somebody else.
-You're bringing me down!

1248
01:55:36,177 --> 01:55:38,691
-You're bringing me fucking down!
-I'm sorry!

1249
01:55:38,857 --> 01:55:42,736
I gotta go make people laugh, and
you're talking about rage and pain.

1250
01:55:42,897 --> 01:55:45,331
-I said I'm sorry!
-It takes fucking wings.

1251
01:55:45,497 --> 01:55:48,648
Miss Seriously, let me tear flypaper, huh?

1252
01:55:49,137 --> 01:55:51,014
Give me a fucking break, honey!

1253
01:55:51,177 --> 01:55:54,692
Give me a fucking break.
Okay, pal? Thank you.

1254
01:55:57,577 --> 01:56:01,286
-What's happening to you?
-What's happening to me? Success.

1255
01:56:01,457 --> 01:56:05,336
Now, you either hang on or hang up.
All right?

1256
01:56:10,737 --> 01:56:14,366
It's a great pleasure to introduce
a young man who's funny and loud.

1257
01:56:14,537 --> 01:56:15,811
Especially during my act.

1258
01:56:15,977 --> 01:56:19,765
Please welcome the comedy stylings
of Ralph Garci, ladies and gentlemen.

1259
01:56:22,177 --> 01:56:27,205
That's right. My name is Ralph Garci,
and I'm a professional asshole.

1260
01:56:31,057 --> 01:56:36,051
That's right. I see we have a couple
of amateurs in the audience tonight.

1261
01:56:36,497 --> 01:56:38,055
Don't we?

1262
01:56:39,377 --> 01:56:42,016
I see. How about sign language?

1263
01:56:42,177 --> 01:56:45,613
We have a standing ovation
over there.

1264
01:56:45,977 --> 01:56:49,128
That's great. Hon, where you from?

1265
01:56:50,017 --> 01:56:54,215
Okey-dokey. That's my best friend.

1266
01:56:55,697 --> 01:56:57,494
Yeah, friends are important.

1267
01:56:58,897 --> 01:57:02,890
I live in the South Bronx, and up there,
you got the Harlems of--

1268
01:57:03,177 --> 01:57:06,886
Shit! I'm sorry.
Excuse me. Fuck it.

1269
01:57:07,337 --> 01:57:08,816
That was supposed to be... .

1270
01:57:09,297 --> 01:57:13,210
The north-- The countries north
of Harlem and west of Puerto Rico.

1271
01:57:13,617 --> 01:57:16,211
That's what it was supposed to be.
Yes, indeed it was.

1272
01:57:16,377 --> 01:57:18,368
Anyway, there's lots of things there:

1273
01:57:18,537 --> 01:57:22,246
Rats, cockroaches,
and, you know, little bugs.

1274
01:57:22,417 --> 01:57:25,932
You know what cockroaches are?
Little things that crawl in the night.

1275
01:57:27,857 --> 01:57:32,294
Listen, I don't mean to alarm you,
but if you don't laugh, you'll get cancer.

1276
01:57:34,377 --> 01:57:38,370
Sorry. That was probably in bad taste,
and I didn't really... .

1277
01:57:42,457 --> 01:57:46,530
Excuse me. Fuck it.
Thank you very much.

1278
01:58:06,897 --> 01:58:07,966
What do you want?

1279
01:58:08,657 --> 01:58:10,727
Pizza sounds good.
You wanna eat?

1280
01:58:11,457 --> 01:58:14,176
Could you give me a break, all right?

1281
01:58:14,617 --> 01:58:17,450
We could split a special,
with anchovies, maybe.

1282
01:58:17,737 --> 01:58:22,765
Fuck anchovies. I died out there,
you're talking about fucking pizzas?

1283
01:58:22,937 --> 01:58:28,295
-No, I'm talking about eating pizzas.
-Oh, that's very funny. You're a howl.

1284
01:58:28,457 --> 01:58:31,415
You should have been out there.
The audience hated me.

1285
01:58:31,577 --> 01:58:35,729
-You had a bad night. That happens.
-Not to me, it doesn't.

1286
01:58:35,897 --> 01:58:39,048
What do you want? lnsurance?
You're in the wrong business.

1287
01:58:39,217 --> 01:58:42,015
Performers aren't safe.
We're pie-in-the-face people.

1288
01:58:42,177 --> 01:58:45,374
Look, don't lecture me.
All right, Sir Laurence?

1289
01:58:45,537 --> 01:58:49,291
All anyone ever promised you was
seven classes a day and a hot lunch.

1290
01:58:49,777 --> 01:58:51,176
The rest is up to you.

1291
01:58:51,337 --> 01:58:55,694
Back in the Middle Ages, actors,
they didn't even want to bury us.

1292
01:58:56,657 --> 01:58:58,329
Well, they do now.

1293
01:58:59,057 --> 01:59:01,571
Not if you're good.

1294
01:59:03,257 --> 01:59:04,929
How do you know?

1295
01:59:05,857 --> 01:59:08,496
How do you know if you're good?

1296
01:59:08,657 --> 01:59:10,693
Maybe you never know.

1297
01:59:15,857 --> 01:59:19,167
You just hang in, I guess.

1298
01:59:23,377 --> 01:59:25,208
You know the weirdest thing...

1299
01:59:26,017 --> 01:59:27,769
...is Freddie.

1300
01:59:28,617 --> 01:59:32,656
When he made it, he realized
it was everything he hated.

1301
01:59:33,177 --> 01:59:35,168
Cadillac Eldorado.

1302
01:59:35,337 --> 01:59:37,328
Pocketful of Quaaludes.

1303
01:59:37,497 --> 01:59:38,896
Johnny Carson.

1304
01:59:39,057 --> 01:59:41,127
It was no special shit.

1305
01:59:41,417 --> 01:59:43,533
You're not Freddie, Ralph.

1306
01:59:43,697 --> 01:59:46,086
I know that. I know.
