00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,667
For some of US,

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,291
all things
but for the war

3
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:01,917
had become a dim memory.

4
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,542
Home was some distant star

5
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:06,458
no closer
than the sun or moon.

6
00:01:06,542 --> 00:01:09,291
Each man dreamed
of that distant star,

7
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,542
of all things
familiar and good,

8
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,166
of fighting
no more battles.

9
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,458
But for some of US,
maybe all of US,

10
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:20,417
going home would only mean
the end of one war

11
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,792
and the beginning
of another.

12
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:24,875
We fought together,

13
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,875
but we'd go home alone.

There are a few touches
here and there,

52
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,041
but I wanted it to be

00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:34,000
just the way
you remembered.

54
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,333
You must be exhausted.

55
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:39,291
I had 14 days to get home.

56

By ship,
then by train...

57
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:44,333
They were in
a much bigger rush

58
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:48,083
to get US to the war
than from it.

59
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,000
I was so proud

60
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,083

that train, George.

62
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,750
It does the trick.

wear it in court.

my taste for gin.

they're not too big

your father, I think.

There were five other men.

79
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:49,333

to look at you.

hadn't done that.

00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:04,041
Ah, it's all right.

84
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:07,667
It's all right.
Forget it.

85
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,375
Well, I've been
waiting four years

86
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,709
to get out of this uniform.

87
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:16,542
So I'm going to, uh...

88
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:21,583
I'll be right back down.

89
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,333

Now, look,
don't everybody
crowd in on him.

100
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,250
He might be shy
'cause of his wound.

101
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,959
He might
not say much.

y'all don't notice.

00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:33,291

00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:45,041
Or we're dead
and nobody told US.

188
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,917
How you feeling?

189
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,166
I'm fine, just fine.

190
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,417
You hear
Johnny dynamite's back?

191
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
Bronze star and all.

192
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:55,542
Everybody will be
at the blue moon
Thursday night.

193
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:56,667
Well, so will I.

194
00:12:57,083 --> 00:13:01,208
In fact, there's
something I want to
talk to you about.

195
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,917
We better
get going, Jesse.

196
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,917
So, I'll see you
Thursday night?

197
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,625
2100?

198
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,250
You can be there
at 2100.

199
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,709
I'm going to be
there at 9:00.

200
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:12,166
Good to see you.

201
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,458
You look great.

202
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,000
Bye-bye.

203
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,750
Will he be all right?

204
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:25,625
It's hard to tell
with head wounds.

205
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:28,375
My father thinks
he'll be o.K.

206
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,291
It'll take some time.

207
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,583
He still likes to
talk, doesn't he?

208
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:35,834
We always said
he was vaccinated with
a phonograph needle.

209
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:38,083
I'm happy to
see you, George.

210
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm busy, though.

211
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:42,333
I just need a minute.
It's important.

212
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:44,625
All right, come on.

213
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:50,291
Last time I saw you,
you were planting
that garden.

214
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,417
You didn't see me.

215
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,625
I was on a bus
on my way to basic.

216
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:57,625
Well, that garden's
long gone.

217
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,542
They tell me you're
doing good work here.

218
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,250
Well, after staring
at the ceiling

219
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,542
for a couple
of months,

220
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:12,250
I realized
that wasn't going
to bring Tim back.

221
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:14,583
I went back
to school.

222
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:16,000
Got my degree--
psychology.

223
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,375
Figured there'd
be plenty to do

224
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,166
when the boys
got back.

225
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,875
So daddy takes care
of their bodies,

226
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,291
and I try to
take care of
their minds.

227
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:28,750
So far, he has
a much higher
success rate.

228
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,959
I just wanted you to know

229
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,041
how sorry I am about Tim.

230
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,083
I was going
to write a letter.

231
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,375
That's all right,
George.

232
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,542
I really didn't know
what to say.

233
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:44,458
Widows aren't
much in fashion
this time of year.

234
00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:46,959
After all,
we won the war,

235
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,959
the boys
are coming home...

236
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,959
Guess it's much easier
to watch a parade.

237
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,583
People don't really
want to think about

238
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:56,542
all those wives
and children

239
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:59,542
that don't feel
much like celebrating.

240
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:01,000
Well, I'm sorry, hope.

241
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,208
If there's anything
I can do...

242
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,667
Why'd you come here,
George?

243
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,250
What is it you
wanted to say to me?

244
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,375
I was with Tim
when he died.

245
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:23,959
It happened right
in front of me.

246
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:28,417
It was so--so quick.

247
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,000
I held him, and...

248
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:33,917
And he died in my arms.

249
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:39,542
Did he suffer, George?
Tell me the truth.

250
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:44,208
I don't think he
really felt anything.

251
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:48,917
Except maybe cold.
He told me he was cold.

252
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:53,083
And then he asked me
to come see you,

253
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:56,500
tell you that
he loved you.

254
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,750
He wanted you to know

255
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:05,125
that he was thinking
of you when he died.

256
00:16:28,542 --> 00:16:33,083
Human beings have
an amazing capacity
for pain, George.

257
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,000
Did you know that?

258
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:37,625
Good thing, because
just about when you think

259
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:39,291
you've had
all you can take,

260
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,542
there's plenty more
to come.

261
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm sorry, hope.

262
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,667
I have to say
I was surprised

263
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,417
when you and Tim became
friends during the war.

264
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:01,333
You were such opposites
in school.

265
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:06,333
Tim was going to
change the world.

266
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:10,375
And you were
going to own it.

267
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,792
That seems like
such a long time ago.

268
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,792
He was a good man,
hope...

269
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,667
And a good friend.

270
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,542
But you don't need me
to tell you that.

271
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:30,083
Like I said,
anything I can do...

272
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,875
George.

273
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,917
Did Tim say anything else?

274
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,083
He looked up at me...

275
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,959
And he said, "don't look
so scared, George.

276
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,917
"You're dead already
anyway.

277
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,458
"You've been dead
ever since law school.

278
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:54,041
You just don't know it."

279
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:16,834
[Loud machine noise]

280
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:48,625
Well, you got
this place humming,
that's for sure.

281
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:53,417
I've never seen it
so organized.

282
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,500
Brand-new lathe.

283
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,750
Yeah, well, we did
pretty good last year.

284
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:00,500
It seemed like a smart idea

285
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:03,500
to put some money back
into the business.

286
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:06,083
I would have asked
you about it, Jess.

287
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:12,417
Well, I wasn't exactly
right around the corner,
now, was I?

288
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,834
Are you all right?

289
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:15,667
Fine. I don't know why

290
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,792
I expected it
to be the same.

291
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,375
Four years is a long time.

292
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,625
That's what I hear.

293
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,959
I'm sorry, Jess.
I didn't mean for it--

294
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,041
that's all right.

295
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,500
What's this?

296
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:40,375
Uh, we got a contract
with the air force base.

297
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,917
Steering linkage
for the c-4.

298
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,375
I can see that, but
what's this 5% over cost

299
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,250
on every 5,000? Hmm?

300
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,458
The mayor.

301
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:52,834
It comes out of our profits.

302
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:56,417
You mean cantrell's
taking a payoff from US

303
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,667
on a military contract?

304
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,417
He brought US the job,
Jesse.

305
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,291
I can't believe it.

306
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:08,917
Whew.

307
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,333
It's one thing
to pay him off
to stay in business.

308
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:13,750
I mean, everybody's
used to that,

309
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:15,667
but to skim...

310
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,083
On a war contract.

311
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:22,500
He's got this whole system
worked out.

312
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,417
Yeah? I'll bet he does.

313
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,792
Business tax,
he calls it.

314
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,959
Everything else
has a luxury tax.

315
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,166
Everybody's got to
live with it.

316
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,625
It ain't just US.

317
00:20:34,709 --> 00:20:37,375
It's just not right!

318
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:43,667
Someday I'm going to
tax him up...

319
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,625
I'll tax him...

320
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:47,750
Right where it hurts.

321
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:49,917
I'll say this much
for Truman.

322
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,667
He doesn't trust
the Russians
the way Roosevelt did.

323
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,667
He understands
they're up to no good.

324
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,542
They were good enough
to fight with US.

325
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,166
Stalin's going to try
to take over the world.

326
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,875
Our next war will be
with the Russians.

327
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:06,417
U.n. Says there won't be
any more wars.

328
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,792
You believe that,
George?

329
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:09,542
No.

330
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,458
Of course not.
It's human nature.

331
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:15,083
As long as there are
things people want
they can't have,

332
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,834
there will be war.

333
00:21:16,917 --> 00:21:18,959
Here's to this war
being over.

334
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,542
Hear, hear.

335
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:28,542
George...

336
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:31,333
How does it feel working
with your father again?

337
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:34,709
Like being back in battle,
only quieter.

338
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,583
George is
the best lawyer
I've got.

339
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:42,417
I'm not sure
I like you
stealing him, Tom.

340
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,083
Obviously I've missed
something here.

341
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:49,709
We've been talking
while you've been gone

342
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:52,208
about the future
of this county.

343
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,291
About your future, too.

344
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:57,709
I have the highest regard
for your father, George,

345
00:21:57,792 --> 00:21:58,750
as you know,

346
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:02,500
and we both agree you
possess certain qualities,

347
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:06,166
qualities that
should not go to waste.

348
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,750
Such as?

349
00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:10,625
I think you're a man
of vision, George.

350
00:22:10,709 --> 00:22:14,583
You have an ability
to see the big picture.

351
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:15,417
You're a born leader.

352
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,625
Election's
coming up next month.

353
00:22:17,709 --> 00:22:20,291
Tom's offering you
a spot on the ticket.

354
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:21,166
County trustee.

355
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,667
Bill Carlson is retiring
on my advice.

356
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,750
We need a fighting man
the veteran can look up to.

357
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:28,542
We need new blood.

358
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,583
I'm not a fighting man
anymore, Tom.

359
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:35,583
My biggest ambition now
is to lay down a lot.

360
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:38,041
It's hard to look up to
somebody taking a nap.

361
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:39,875
I'm serious.

362
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:42,750
This has been
in the cards for you.

363
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:44,166
You can't deny your destiny.

364
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:48,834
It's not that I don't
appreciate the offer,
because I do.

365
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:51,291
I don't need an answer now.

366
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:53,000
You think about it.

367
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:56,959
Talk it over with that
beautiful wife of yours.

368
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:58,792
But remember this, George.

369
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:02,291
Your time has come.

370
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:06,333
It's been going on
since we were kids.

371
00:23:06,542 --> 00:23:10,750
Ever since that greedy
been mayor,
he's bled this county dry.

372
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:13,917
He gets a piece
of every contract.

373
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,417
You bid
to build the road,

374
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,625
put cantrell
down for 10%.

375
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:22,166
He taxes every
bottle of beer I open
and every case of liquor.

376
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:25,792
I pay him on every
gallon of gas I sell.

377
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:28,917
Cantrell keeps clean.
Sheriff mcmillan
does his collecting.

378
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,250
If you don't like it,
mcmillan will
bust your head.

379
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:36,166
We didn't take this
from the Nazis.

380
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,709
Why come home and
take it from cantrell?

381
00:23:39,792 --> 00:23:40,709
That's right.

382
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:42,875
Right, George?

383
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,166
You're right,
sure.

384
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,542
But it's been going
on a long time.

385
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,083
People
are used to it.

386
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,709
Besides, cantrell
has his good points

387
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:54,000
as far as the town's
concerned.

388
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:57,458
He brings a lot of work
into this county.

389
00:23:57,542 --> 00:24:01,917
He takes care of
the people that
take care of him.

390
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,792
Whose side are you on?

391
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,166
Since when
are there sides?

392
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,583
Since now.
An election's coming up.

393
00:24:07,667 --> 00:24:09,834
Nobody serious
has opposed cantrell.

394
00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:11,834
We're going to change that.

395
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,208
We'll form our own party,

396
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:15,917
not democrat,
not republican,
but veteran.

397
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,083
We'll get the vets together
and run for--for...

398
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:22,625
You all right?

399
00:24:22,709 --> 00:24:24,959
It's nothing.
Like I'm saying,

400
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:29,000
we'll run...Jack for sheriff,
bill for county clerk,

401
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:30,583
and Johnny for trustee.

402
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:33,417
Straight bet
right down the line!

403
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,583
A Mexican trustee?

404
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:39,041
I think you've
gone crazy, Jesse.

405
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:42,083
Don't laugh.
It's the best chance
you've got.

406
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:45,333
It's the best chance
we all got.

407
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:46,333
How about it, George?

408
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:51,000
Oh, it's...
It's a good idea,
all right.

409
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:52,417
But it will never work.

410
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,041
Cantrell's too powerful
and experienced.

411
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:58,291
I'm sorry to hear
you say that.

412
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:03,500
I was hoping you'd
head up the ticket for US--
run for mayor.

413
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:05,458
We'd be unbeatable
with you, George.

414
00:25:05,542 --> 00:25:06,750
Wait a minute.

415
00:25:07,792 --> 00:25:09,083
Now,
I'm flattered, Jess.

416
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:12,291
I really am.
I wish I could help.

417
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:15,458
I'm talking about
helping the county.

418
00:25:15,542 --> 00:25:18,583
You're assuming
the county wants
to be helped.

419
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:21,083
People are
as fed up as we are.

420
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:24,041
Maybe they don't know it,
but they are.

421
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:26,583
This is
a good fairy tale,
but it's late,

422
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:28,250
and I've got to go.

423
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,125
You won't make history.

424
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:33,417
You're going
to miss out.

425
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,291
The only thing
I want to make
is money.

426
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:40,291
Hasta luego,
amigos.

427
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:45,000
Last chance, George.

428
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,000
I'm sorry, Jess.

429
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:52,250
I'm just not interested.

430
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:59,625
This is what we've been
waiting for, George.

431
00:25:59,709 --> 00:26:00,834
This is your chance.

432
00:26:00,917 --> 00:26:03,250
You have greatness in you.

433
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:04,625
I see it.

434
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:06,083
Your father sees it.

435
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:08,375
Tom cantrell sees it.

436
00:26:08,458 --> 00:26:12,375
You're the only one
who doesn't.

437
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:16,792
I don't know
what's right anymore.

438
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:22,083
That's what you have
me for, darling.

439
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:28,458
Do you remember
hope Tyler's husband?

440
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:31,208
The poor man
who got killed.

441
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:34,417
Yes, of course.

442
00:26:35,542 --> 00:26:39,083
I was with him
when he died.

443
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:41,291
He said something to me,

444
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:46,333
something I can't
get out of my head.

445
00:26:48,792 --> 00:26:50,417
He told me that--

446
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,125
shh...

447
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:55,834
You've got to stop
dwelling on the past, George.

448
00:26:55,917 --> 00:26:59,208
It's time to put
the war behind you.

449
00:26:59,291 --> 00:27:00,583
Think about US.

450
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:03,417
Think about our future.

451
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:08,959
Oh. Run with cantrell,
darling.

452
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:10,875
This is only the beginning.

453
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:15,208
All we have to do
is take that first leap.

454
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:17,875
We're ready for this.

455
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:21,250
We deserve this.

456
00:27:22,542 --> 00:27:25,542
[Applause]

457
00:27:27,917 --> 00:27:33,250
[Singing in Spanish]

458
00:28:17,417 --> 00:28:19,959
[Applause]

459
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:23,792
[Whistling]

460
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,375
[Whistling]

461
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:28,458
Look at Juan.

462
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:30,917
Like a big kid,
huh?

463
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,291
That's one big kid

464
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:35,375
I'll take on my side
every time.

465
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:37,000
Best dynamite man
I've ever seen.

466
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:39,792
He's the only dynamite man
you've ever seen.

467
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:40,959
Who dialed
your number?

468
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:44,417
Andy, let's hear that
bunker routine again.

469
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,959
Achtung, der luftwaffe!

470
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:49,041
Ze Americans dropped
bombs left und right.

471
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:52,000
The fuhrer says
damage is slight.

472
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:55,333
However, as a result
of zis mission...

473
00:28:55,417 --> 00:28:59,333
One of our cities
is missing.

474
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,417
Hey, George,
remember the night

475
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,792
your sleeping bag
caught on fire?

476
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:09,333
I thought my feet were
finally getting warm.

477
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:13,333
Nobody told me
I was on fire.

478
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:22,000
It's a beautiful wedding,
isn't it?

479
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:23,208
Yes, it is.

480
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:28,417
Sometimes it's
a good idea to get away
from the men.

481
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,750
They like to talk
amongst themselves.

482
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:33,959
As long as they
stay out of trouble.

483
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:36,208
I wouldn't worry
about that.

484
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:37,375
They talk big,

485
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:38,709
but they're
essentially harmless,

486
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:43,917
like a school of fish
or a flock of birds.

487
00:29:44,834 --> 00:29:49,959
Miss Meade, can I
ask you a question,
personally?

488
00:29:50,041 --> 00:29:51,291
It's Barbara.

489
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:52,500
Certainly.

490
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:57,875
Does George act funny
since he's been back?

491
00:29:57,959 --> 00:30:01,417
I'm sorry,
I don't mean funny,
not like that.

492
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,834
What I mean is,

493
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:04,959
do you think he...

494
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:07,667
Is there anything
different about him?

495
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,750
For instance,
Jesse, well,

496
00:30:09,834 --> 00:30:13,709
he doesn't know how
to talk to me anymore,

497
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:15,500
and I don't know if...

498
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:18,500
My husband
is perfectly fine.

499
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:21,250
Excuse me.

500
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:27,291
So we're going to register
for the election next week.

501
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:30,959
Can't believe how much
paperwork there is.

502
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:32,041
I envy you, Jesse.

503
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:36,083
You're a man who
knows what he wants.

504
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:37,834
How about you, George?

505
00:30:37,917 --> 00:30:39,875
What do you want?

506
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:42,333
I wish I knew.

507
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:48,250
Well, you missed
your chance to run with US.

508
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:51,792
We got a new candidate
for mayor.

509
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:53,250
Who?

510
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:54,750
Me.

511
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:03,542
I'm trying real hard,
hope.

512
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:04,667
I swear I am.

513
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:10,166
Oh, and I don't know
if I'm doing right
or not.

514
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,041
Jesse?

515
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:15,041
He gets these spells.

516
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:19,291
He can't remember how
to do certain things,

517
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:23,709
and sometimes
his voice gets stuck.

518
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:25,834
He just goes wild.

519
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:28,709
He scares the boy
half to death.

520
00:31:28,792 --> 00:31:30,250
Me, too.

521
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:32,250
Does he try to hurt you?

522
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:35,125
No, no.

523
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:37,667
Mostly,
he just hurts himself.

524
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:42,542
Jesse's going to
get better.

525
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:45,125
It's just a matter of time.

526
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:48,834
He wants me
to quit working.

527
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:53,875
What do you think?

528
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:58,500
Hope, I love
running that factory.

529
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:01,166
And I had a real knack
for it, too.

530
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,375
We're making
more money now

531
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:04,750
than we did
when Jesse ran it.

532
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:08,125
Have you tried talking
to him about it?

533
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:11,166
It's not as easy
as it used to be.

534
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,291
He doesn't want to
talk anymore.

535
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:16,458
He didn't even talk
to me about running
for mayor.

536
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:17,625
He just decided himself.

537
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:19,542
It's crazy.

538
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:23,083
Have you thought
about encouraging him?

539
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:26,917
He's doing something
he believes in.

540
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,125
Encourage him?

541
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:31,375
Hope, he's got
no chance.

542
00:32:31,458 --> 00:32:32,333
Let's face it.

543
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:36,625
No, the whole thing
is just plain foolish.

544
00:32:36,709 --> 00:32:39,625
Not to him.

545
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:44,542
I better get on back.

546
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:46,333
Thanks for the time,
though.

547
00:32:46,417 --> 00:32:49,375
I wish I had the answers
for you, Becky.

548
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:52,667
It's just nice to have
someone listen.

549
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,250
Becky.

550
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:57,458
You're taking care
of a lot things right now.

551
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:00,000
Don't forget
to take care of yourself.

552
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:03,208
You ever want somebody
to talk to, day or night,

553
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:04,750
you know where I am.

554
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:10,000
You take such good care
of everybody, hope.

555
00:33:10,083 --> 00:33:13,667
Who takes care of you?

556
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,709
Hello, sir.

557
00:33:17,792 --> 00:33:20,417
What can I do for you, son?

558
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,166
My name is Juan Medina.

559
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,959
I came about the job--
office clerk.

560
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:30,041
I see. Well,
have a seat there,
Mr. Medina.

561
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:31,417
Thank you.

562
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:34,792
Oh, um,

563
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:37,375
these are
my discharge papers.

564
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:39,542
Honorable discharge.

565
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:40,500
Mm-hmm.

566
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:43,750
They really give you
the bronze star, son?

567
00:33:43,834 --> 00:33:47,041
Yes, sir.
It's right here.

568
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:47,917
[Telephone rings]

569
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,125
So they did.

570
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:51,500
Well, uh,
what would you say

571
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:55,417
your qualifications are,
Mr. Medina?

572
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:57,500
Very hard worker.

573
00:33:57,875 --> 00:34:00,291
Do you know
anything about
the insurance business?

574
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:01,333
I learn fast.

575
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:03,625
I learned very fast
in the service.

576
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,041
I had special training.

577
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:08,166
What kind of
special training?

578
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,542
Munitions, explosives...

579
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:11,792
Ahem.

580
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:16,041
We don't have occasion
to blow up too much
around here,

581
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:20,000
but if we do,
we'll know who to call.

582
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,667
The ad says no experience.

583
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:27,709
I'm sorry, son,
I just don't think
it's going to work out.

584
00:34:35,917 --> 00:34:37,959
Look, uh, I tell you what.

585
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:40,792
If you really
need a job, son,

586
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:44,959
I can always use
somebody to sweep up
around here.

587
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:45,959
If you want to,

588
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:49,875
come on back
just before closing.

589
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:02,750
I'd like to help him out,

590
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,542
but what could he do here?

591
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:07,125
I was thinking
maybe file clerk.

592
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:10,208
Tom cantrell's nephew
is our file clerk.

593
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:14,000
You mean the kid that
sits around all day.

594
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:15,583
You're good lawyer, George,

595
00:35:15,667 --> 00:35:19,417
but since when did
you get so friendly
with the Mexicans?

596
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,542
Dad, I trust my life
with this man.

597
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:24,333
We'd be lucky
to have him.

598
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,583
Don't be naive, George.

599
00:35:25,917 --> 00:35:28,333
He doesn't have
the right qualifications.

600
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:31,458
You understand
what I'm saying.

601
00:35:32,208 --> 00:35:33,917
Loud and clear.

602
00:35:34,542 --> 00:35:37,959
Your heart's
in the right place, son.

603
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:44,041
Bring me the malinson file,
would you?

604
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:51,917
I'm sorry, Johnny.

605
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,166
That's o.K.
I understand, George.

606
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,166
Well, it's, you know,

607
00:35:56,542 --> 00:35:59,500
there's just no openings.
It's a small company.

608
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:01,458
It's o.K.
Thanks for trying.

609
00:36:01,542 --> 00:36:04,125
You know,
if things are tight,

610
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:06,542
I can spot you some dough.

611
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:08,917
Oh, no,
nothing like that.

612
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,834
I'm fine.

613
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,208
No, thank you.

614
00:36:11,291 --> 00:36:12,959
Just keep it in mind.

615
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:17,000
You don't have to
worry about me.

616
00:36:20,542 --> 00:36:23,417
You ever miss the war,
George?

617
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,583
The truth?

618
00:36:28,291 --> 00:36:30,458
A little bit, yeah.

619
00:36:30,542 --> 00:36:32,834
Me, too.

620
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,125
George.

621
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,083
You better hurry.
We're going to be late.

622
00:36:45,166 --> 00:36:46,291
Late for what?

623
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:48,291
Oh, don't tease me,
darling.

624
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:49,208
The carlsons'
dinner party.

625
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:53,083
It's been
on the calendar
for weeks.

626
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:53,959
I don't feel well.

627
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:57,250
You'll feel better
after a nice dinner.

628
00:36:57,333 --> 00:36:59,083
I'm not in the mood
for a party.

629
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:00,875
You haven't been
in the mood
for anything.

630
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:03,792
Snap out of it.
The war's over.

631
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:08,083
How easy.
Why didn't I think of that?

632
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:10,667
Don't be sarcastic.
It doesn't suit you.

633
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,166
I don't want to sit
at another party

634
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:16,917
where everyone wants
to hear war stories
I'm trying to forget.

635
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,667
Very unlike a candidate.

636
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,959
Well, I'm not yet, am I?

637
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:23,625
Ronny bishop
called today from
the ovington observer.

638
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:26,250
Wanted to know if
the rumor was true

639
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:28,333
you're running
with cantrell.

640
00:37:28,417 --> 00:37:31,083
Must be a slow news day.

641
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,250
I told him you were.

642
00:37:34,709 --> 00:37:36,125
You did what?

643
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:39,083
It doesn't hurt
to get a little press.

644
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:42,125
Let cantrell know people
are interested in you.

645
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:45,041
Barbara, I haven't told
anyone I'm running.

646
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:47,750
I haven't even
told anyone
I'm strolling yet.

647
00:37:47,834 --> 00:37:51,625
My advice to you
is you call
Ronny what's-his-name

648
00:37:51,709 --> 00:37:54,542
and tell him
you're mistaken.

649
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:05,542
George, you know
you're going to run.

650
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:09,917
You're going to
run because it's
the right thing to do.

651
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,625
You better shave, darling.

652
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:18,041
Oil's o.K.

653
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:20,125
That will be 2.35, sir.

654
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:21,083
Here.

655
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:23,166
Thank you.

656
00:38:33,917 --> 00:38:37,125
[Dog barking]

657
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:38,917
Oh, there are the neighbors!

658
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,583
Hello, Mr. Jones!

659
00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:43,792
Yes, I do have the most
beautiful house on the block.

660
00:38:43,875 --> 00:38:44,834
Thank you.

661
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,291
My car?

662
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:49,291
It's just something
I use to get around in.

663
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:54,542
A car like this,
it's just wasted
on rich people.

664
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:55,417
You know why?

665
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,375
No. Why?

666
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,959
'Cause everything
they have is this good,

667
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:00,959
so they don't
even notice anymore.

668
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:06,083
I haven't even got
a chair as comfortable
as these seats.

669
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:07,834
I'd always notice.

670
00:39:08,542 --> 00:39:11,542
Someday we'll have
a car like this.

671
00:39:11,625 --> 00:39:12,709
You know?

672
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:16,125
A car you can't
hear coming
from five blocks away?

673
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:17,375
I know.

674
00:39:17,458 --> 00:39:18,667
Hmm.

675
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,000
I'll be right back.

676
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:31,959
Howdy.

677
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,750
Fill it.

678

[Ding]

679
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:41,375
You're that kid
they gave that
bronze star to, right?

680
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:42,500
That's right.

681
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,417
So I'm getting my...

682
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,125
My gas pumped
by a genuine hero.

683
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,000
I like that.

684
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:54,041
[Ding]

685
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:04,959
Andy!

686
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:14,875
It's going to be
85 cents.

687
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:15,625
Where's Andy?

688
00:40:15,834 --> 00:40:18,208
Oh, he had to
leave early.

689
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:20,542
And left you in charge?

690
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:21,333
Uh-huh.

691
00:40:21,667 --> 00:40:23,375
It will be 85 cents
for the gas.

692
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:25,083
You didn't
need much.

693
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:27,291
Whoa, son. Relax.

694
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:29,959
You're working too hard.

695
00:40:30,709 --> 00:40:33,291
You know what
the problem is

696
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:35,667
with your people
from Mexico way?

697
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:38,041
They think the world
owes them a living.

698
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:41,083
That's why I like to see
a hard-working Mexican
like you.

699
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:44,875
You talk good.
These others don't
talk good English.

700
00:40:45,917 --> 00:40:49,458
Maybe someday I'll
give you lessons.

701
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,208
O.k., son,
where is it?

702
00:40:56,291 --> 00:40:57,709
What do you mean?
What?

703
00:40:57,792 --> 00:40:58,583
Envelope with
my name on it.

704
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:00,583
Where did
your boss leave it?

705
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,500
I don't know
what you're
talking about.

706
00:41:04,583 --> 00:41:07,458
Andy will be back
in the morning.

707
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:11,709
I really do need
that 85 cents for gas.

708
00:41:11,792 --> 00:41:15,083
You got it
all wrong, son.

709
00:41:15,166 --> 00:41:16,750
I don't pay you,

710
00:41:16,834 --> 00:41:19,667
you pay me.

711
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,750
Now, where's
my envelope?

712
00:41:21,834 --> 00:41:25,208
I haven't seen
any envelope.

713
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:29,709
Maybe, uh,
just maybe...

714
00:41:32,667 --> 00:41:35,291
You put it in
your own pocket.

715
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:39,083
Look, I told you
I don't know what
you're talking about.

716
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:53,834
[Crashing]

717
00:41:53,917 --> 00:41:55,709
Juan!

718
00:41:57,083 --> 00:41:58,500
Juan!

719
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:00,500
Stop it!

720
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:02,208
Stop it!

721
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:02,917
Damn it!

722
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:05,875
How could he
do this to US?

723
00:42:05,959 --> 00:42:08,542
He's turned his back
on the whole town.

724
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:10,458
People like George stick
with their own kind.

725
00:42:10,542 --> 00:42:12,417
This doesn't change
anything.

726
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,750
Still going to run.
Kick their butts.

727
00:42:14,834 --> 00:42:18,875
Who's going to vote
for US with George
running against US?

728
00:42:18,959 --> 00:42:20,959
I don't want to
hear that.

729
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:22,208
Our flyers
are printed.

730
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:24,583
We'll hit
the streets
tomorrow.

731
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:25,542
I got to lock up.

732
00:42:25,875 --> 00:42:29,000
Anybody finds out
I let you in here--

733
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:31,166
[wheels rolling]

734
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:47,583
You can count me in,
amigos.

735
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:59,291
Well, you got to give
the poor fella credit.

736
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:02,667
He's got the courage
of his convictions.

737
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:05,250
Veterans party,
bipartisan--

738
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,458
the man has
some imagination,

739
00:43:07,542 --> 00:43:08,500
don't you think, George?

740
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:11,083
Now, what do you suppose
he's after?

741
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:15,834
What do you think
he really wants
out of all this?

742
00:43:15,917 --> 00:43:19,500
I think he wants to
do the right thing.

743
00:43:19,583 --> 00:43:23,709
Now I really
feel sorry for him.

744
00:43:25,208 --> 00:43:26,834
Cigar, George?

745
00:43:26,917 --> 00:43:27,834
No, thank you.

746
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:31,250
Is there anything else
we need to go over?

747
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:32,917
No, it's all clear.

748
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,250
Aw, cheer up, son.

749
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:35,750
There's nothing
to it.

750
00:43:35,834 --> 00:43:38,041
We'll make a couple
of speeches,

751
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:40,917
show up at some
fund-raising dinners

752
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,959
for our beloved
governor,

753
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:45,333
and play 18 holes
on election day.

754
00:43:45,417 --> 00:43:46,959
It's that easy.

755
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,834
It's a blessing.

756
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:51,417
People know
what's right.

757
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:54,583
Who also know
what's wrong.

758
00:43:55,083 --> 00:43:58,083
Afraid I don't
follow you there, George.

759
00:43:58,166 --> 00:44:01,583
You know what
I'm talking about,
don't you?

760
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:02,959
No idea.

761
00:44:05,041 --> 00:44:07,834
You paid a visit
to Juan Medina yesterday.

762
00:44:07,917 --> 00:44:10,291
Ended up beating him
half to death.

763
00:44:10,375 --> 00:44:12,834
Little misunderstanding
over a payoff, I'm told.

764
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:14,750
What's this all about,
sheriff?

765
00:44:14,834 --> 00:44:17,875
Beats me. I never
touched him.

766
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,000
George...

767
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,291
George, I think
this election

768
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:25,792
is getting you
all jittery.

769
00:44:25,875 --> 00:44:28,792
Why don't you relax
for a few days?

770
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:30,834
I've got everything
under control.

771
00:44:30,917 --> 00:44:32,792
Yeah, you
treat this county

772
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:35,917
like it's your own
little dictatorship, Tom.

773
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,583
How long do you think

774
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:38,834
people are going to
stand for that?

775
00:44:38,917 --> 00:44:41,834
I wouldn't be so
quick to judge, son.

776
00:44:41,917 --> 00:44:45,917
Remember, we're all
in this together.

777
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,250
Besides, everybody's
a little tainted

778
00:44:49,333 --> 00:44:51,667
one way or another.

779
00:44:59,875 --> 00:45:00,834
[Door closes]

780
00:45:00,917 --> 00:45:03,250
Born politician.

781
00:45:04,542 --> 00:45:08,125
What do you want me
to do about meadows?

782
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:10,166
Do? Why?
What is there to do?

783
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,500
Let the boy run.

784
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:14,667
As a matter of fact,

785
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,709
I'll give him the chance

786
00:45:16,792 --> 00:45:19,750
to go head to head
with me--public debate.

787
00:45:19,834 --> 00:45:23,000
That's going to look
like you take him
serious.

788
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:24,625
No. It's going to
make it look like

789
00:45:24,709 --> 00:45:26,291
I have nothing to fear.

790
00:45:27,583 --> 00:45:29,458
Besides,
as I understand it,

791
00:45:29,542 --> 00:45:33,125
this boy left
half his brain
on some battlefield.

792
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:36,041
We'll get him in front
of the people

793
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:39,834
and let them see exactly
what kind of man

794
00:45:39,917 --> 00:45:42,709
wants to be their mayor.

795
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:57,875
Just set it down.

796
00:45:58,041 --> 00:46:00,333
Thank you. Ahem.

797
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:06,041
You think this is
all a big joke,
don't you?

798
00:46:06,125 --> 00:46:07,625
I never
said that.

799
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,500
You don't have to.

800
00:46:10,041 --> 00:46:11,959
It's all over
your face

801
00:46:12,041 --> 00:46:13,291
every time
you look at me.

802
00:46:13,375 --> 00:46:17,834
I'm just afraid
you're taking on
too much too soon.

803
00:46:17,917 --> 00:46:21,083
You're worrying
I'll make a fool
of myself.

804
00:46:21,166 --> 00:46:22,000
Don't start this again.

805
00:46:22,333 --> 00:46:25,792
If you feel
this is what you
have to do,

806
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:26,667
then do it.

807
00:46:27,041 --> 00:46:29,875
Well, maybe it would
be a little easier

808
00:46:29,959 --> 00:46:32,709
if I thought
you were behind me.

809
00:46:32,792 --> 00:46:36,667
I am. I don't understand
what you want.

810
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:37,792
Yes, you do.

811
00:46:37,875 --> 00:46:39,291
I'm going to
ask you again.

812
00:46:39,375 --> 00:46:43,750
Quit the factory
and work with me
on this.

813
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:45,000
I need you.

814
00:46:45,083 --> 00:46:47,333
I can get men
to run that factory

815
00:46:47,417 --> 00:46:49,166
just as good as you.

816
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:50,750
Oh, is that right?

817
00:46:51,125 --> 00:46:55,250
Why don't you get
those men to run
this election?

818
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:57,834
Because I need
my wife.

819
00:46:57,917 --> 00:47:01,000
How do you think
it looks when you're
never around?

820
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:03,709
People don't think
you take it serious.

821
00:47:03,792 --> 00:47:06,709
This has nothing to do
with the election.

822
00:47:06,792 --> 00:47:10,417
You don't like me
running that factory
by myself.

823
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,208
You want me
waiting on you.

824
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:14,291
That's a lie.

825
00:47:14,375 --> 00:47:17,875
How come
you didn't need me

826
00:47:17,959 --> 00:47:20,875
when you cooked up
your veterans party?

827
00:47:20,959 --> 00:47:23,709
You didn't bother
talking to me about it.

828
00:47:23,792 --> 00:47:27,250
You made me feel
I wasn't part of things
anymore,

829
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:29,041
and that hurt, Jesse.

830
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:31,375
That hurt?

831
00:47:31,625 --> 00:47:35,709
Well, how do you
think it feels
to come home

832
00:47:35,792 --> 00:47:40,250
and see your wife
doing your job
for you?

833
00:47:43,709 --> 00:47:47,041
That you don't
fit in no more?

834
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:48,667
That was
in your mind.

835
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:52,125
I never tried
to make you feel
that way.

836
00:47:52,208 --> 00:47:54,625
I wanted you
to come back
to the factory.

837
00:47:54,709 --> 00:47:57,458
I didn't tell you
to run for mayor.

838
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:58,458
Is that right?

839
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,875
Well I'll tell you what...

840
00:47:59,959 --> 00:48:01,583
I'll drop out
of the race,

841
00:48:01,667 --> 00:48:02,583
take the factory
over again,

842
00:48:02,667 --> 00:48:03,667
and you could
stay home with Sam.

843
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,875
How would that be?

844
00:48:07,917 --> 00:48:10,709
I'll call Juan
right now.

845
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:15,500
Jesse!

846
00:48:18,667 --> 00:48:22,041
You don't want that,
do you?

847
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:26,709
You don't want me
back there.

848
00:48:28,917 --> 00:48:29,875
It's not like that.

849
00:48:30,291 --> 00:48:34,417
It's just that
I've been running it
for a long time,

850
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,417
and I've done good
with it, real good.

851
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,625
I never dreamed
I could run a business.

852
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:43,542
It feels good
to use my brain.

853
00:48:44,959 --> 00:48:47,834
Maybe it makes me
like myself more,

854
00:48:47,917 --> 00:48:50,583
but it doesn't mean
I love you less.

855
00:48:51,291 --> 00:48:54,125
You can't ask me
to go back

856
00:48:54,208 --> 00:48:57,583
to the way
things were, Jesse.

857
00:48:58,291 --> 00:49:00,125
Well, you better
figure out

858
00:49:00,208 --> 00:49:02,709
what's more
important to you--

859
00:49:02,792 --> 00:49:06,709
your job
or your husband.

860
00:49:11,834 --> 00:49:14,834
How come I'm the one
that has to decide?

861
00:49:14,917 --> 00:49:17,709
Maybe you better
figure out what's
more important to you--

862
00:49:17,792 --> 00:49:20,583
the election
or your wife.

863
00:49:26,583 --> 00:49:29,625
I'll be the one
to give out jobs,

864
00:49:29,709 --> 00:49:31,542
take bids
on county work.

865
00:49:31,625 --> 00:49:33,834
I'll make
a very good salary--

866
00:49:33,917 --> 00:49:38,417
move out of this place,
get a house in town.

867
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,458
What do you think, huh?

868
00:49:40,542 --> 00:49:43,417
What about your job?

869
00:49:44,583 --> 00:49:45,583
I'll quit.

870
00:49:45,667 --> 00:49:47,709
This campaign
is my job now.

871
00:50:08,834 --> 00:50:10,834
I thought
you'd be happy.

872
00:50:10,917 --> 00:50:13,166
For once we get
a chance

873
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:16,458
to take things
into our own hands,

874
00:50:16,542 --> 00:50:19,709
to make the rules
ourselves.

875
00:50:21,917 --> 00:50:23,500
What are
you thinking?

876
00:50:23,583 --> 00:50:26,417
About my sister...

877
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,709
The one in California.

878
00:50:27,792 --> 00:50:31,417
Her husband works
on a farm.

879
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,208
They are safe there.

880
00:50:33,291 --> 00:50:35,709
There are a lot of jobs.

881
00:50:35,792 --> 00:50:37,959
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

882
00:50:38,041 --> 00:50:43,417
She has a lemon tree
right outside her window.

883
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:48,125
I'm not going to
run away.

884
00:50:48,208 --> 00:50:51,667
You have to fight
to change things.

885
00:50:55,542 --> 00:50:57,583
I'm afraid.

886
00:50:58,583 --> 00:50:59,750
Of what?

887
00:50:59,834 --> 00:51:03,750
Of what they will
do to you.

888
00:51:07,417 --> 00:51:08,291
I say it's time

889
00:51:08,667 --> 00:51:11,792
for people to stop
having to live
in fear

890
00:51:11,875 --> 00:51:14,250
of our sheriff
and his deputies.

891
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:17,417
It's time for people
to stop paying
bribes

892
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,792
just to keep their
businesses open.

893
00:51:19,875 --> 00:51:23,333
I say it's time
for a change.

894
00:51:23,417 --> 00:51:25,500
That time is now.

895
00:51:28,709 --> 00:51:34,375
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have patiently listened

896
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:40,250
while this young man
has made his wild
accusations...

897
00:51:41,834 --> 00:51:45,208
But I ask you,
and I ask my opponent,

898
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:48,458
where is the proof?

899
00:51:48,542 --> 00:51:49,542
There is no proof

900
00:51:49,917 --> 00:51:51,959
because
sheriff mcmillan
will bust your head

901
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:54,041
if anybody
comes forward.

902
00:51:54,125 --> 00:52:00,458
Sheriff mcmillan
has made the streets
of our town safe, safe,

903
00:52:00,542 --> 00:52:03,041
and this is the thanks
he gets for it.

904
00:52:03,125 --> 00:52:06,166
Safe unless
you refuse to pay
Tom cantrell,

905
00:52:06,542 --> 00:52:08,375
safe unless
you're a Mexican,

906
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:11,125
safe unless
he don't like
your skin color.

907
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:15,166
All right, I think
you've made yourself
abundantly clear

908
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:18,667
as to how you feel
about what is wrong.

909
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:21,792
I'd like to hear
how you'd make it right.

910
00:52:21,875 --> 00:52:26,542
Mr. Meadows,
what are your plans

911
00:52:26,625 --> 00:52:30,125
for running our city?

912
00:52:34,166 --> 00:52:37,166
Well, I got a lot
of ideas. I...

913
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:40,083
How do you propose
to raise money

914
00:52:40,166 --> 00:52:42,875
for the sewage system
that we need?

915
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:47,542
There's a lot
of ways to raise
that money.

916
00:52:47,625 --> 00:52:50,166
Well, we're all ears.

917
00:52:54,041 --> 00:52:55,792
Well, I haven't
firmed up...

918
00:52:55,875 --> 00:52:58,917
I haven't firmed up
the best way yet.

919
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,542
I haven't
firmed that up yet.

920
00:53:01,625 --> 00:53:02,625
I see.

921
00:53:02,709 --> 00:53:04,250
Well, what about
property taxes?

922
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:06,834
I can guarantee
the people of this town

923
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:09,917
don't want to pay
one more penny
in property taxes,

924
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,542
but they want
a brand-new grade school.

925
00:53:12,625 --> 00:53:15,542
How do you propose
to solve that problem?

926
00:53:16,542 --> 00:53:21,709
No, the answers
are not in those papers,
Mr. Meadows.

927
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:26,625
You don't know
the answers.

928
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:35,667
Being the mayor is more
than pointing fingers

929
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:37,917
and making accusations.

930
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,709
You have got to have
the experience...

931
00:53:43,792 --> 00:53:48,250
And you have got to
have the brains.

932
00:53:49,375 --> 00:53:53,250
All I need
is a fair chance.

933
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,959
That's more than
you've given US...

934
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:01,667
But I can run
this town.

935
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:05,417
I can
run this town...

936
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:10,709
Just as...

937
00:54:10,792 --> 00:54:12,291
Just...

938
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,000
As...

939
00:54:16,083 --> 00:54:18,834
Just as...

940
00:54:19,291 --> 00:54:21,583
You were saying?

941
00:54:28,625 --> 00:54:30,333
Just...

942
00:54:56,709 --> 00:54:58,875
[Thunder]

943
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:08,583
[Telephone rings]

944
00:55:09,959 --> 00:55:11,750
[Ring]

945
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:13,041
Hello?

946
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:15,750
George,
it's Becky meadows.

947
00:55:15,834 --> 00:55:17,208
What is it?
What's the matter?

948
00:55:17,291 --> 00:55:18,625
It's Jesse.

949
00:55:18,709 --> 00:55:20,709
I need help, George.

950
00:55:21,834 --> 00:55:23,166
He's got a gun.

951
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:24,583
I'll be right there.

952
00:55:25,458 --> 00:55:27,041
Ooh!

953
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,500
Jesse, please,
come inside.

954
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:33,917
Get away from me!

955
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,750
Just leave me alone!

956
00:55:35,834 --> 00:55:40,542
Jesse, I want
to talk to you
for a minute.

957
00:55:40,625 --> 00:55:41,333
Jesse.

958
00:55:41,667 --> 00:55:45,458
I just want everything
to go away.

959
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:47,917
No!
Jesse!

960
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,417
If you
hurt yourself,

961
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,667
you'll hurt
Becky and Sam, too.

962
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:53,500
Is that
what you want?

963
00:55:56,542 --> 00:55:59,417
I want you to leave.

964
00:55:59,834 --> 00:56:02,458
I don't want nothing
from you.

965
00:56:02,542 --> 00:56:04,875
It's none
of your business, hope.

966
00:56:04,959 --> 00:56:08,458
Why can't everybody
just leave me alone?

967
00:56:08,542 --> 00:56:09,458
Just leave me alone!

968
00:56:09,834 --> 00:56:12,875
What about Becky?
Have you talked
to her?

969
00:56:12,959 --> 00:56:14,834
Talk to Becky.

970
00:56:15,709 --> 00:56:17,291
You get out of...

971
00:56:17,375 --> 00:56:19,542
Get out of here,
George.

972
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:22,000
You're a traitor.

973
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:26,250
I don't want nothing to do
with you, George Meade.

974
00:56:28,166 --> 00:56:30,500
Give me that gun, Jesse.

975
00:56:30,583 --> 00:56:33,000
I just as soon
shoot you

976
00:56:33,083 --> 00:56:34,166
as shoot myself,
George.

977
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:35,000
Now, you get away!

978
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:36,333
Give me that gun.

979
00:56:36,417 --> 00:56:38,000
George, please.

980
00:56:38,917 --> 00:56:44,291
Come on, Jess,
you can't let it
end this way.

981
00:56:44,542 --> 00:56:46,500
Let me do it,
George.

982
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:50,000
I just want to
do it.

983
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:55,250
I can't stand it
anymore, George.

984
00:56:55,333 --> 00:56:57,959
I...i can't
think straight.

985
00:56:58,041 --> 00:57:01,208
I can't
talk straight.

986
00:57:01,291 --> 00:57:05,375
I don't want to
be like this.

987
00:57:08,375 --> 00:57:13,458
I want everything
to be the way it
used to be, George.

988
00:57:13,542 --> 00:57:16,959
I want it all.
I want it all back.

989
00:57:17,041 --> 00:57:20,917
We all want it back.
You think I don't?

990
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,834
You think I wouldn't
trade everything

991
00:57:22,917 --> 00:57:24,417
just to have
my life back

992
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,166
the way it was before?

993
00:57:27,834 --> 00:57:31,333
I don't know
where I belong
anymore, George.

994
00:57:31,417 --> 00:57:35,417
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do now.

995
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,333
I don't...

996
00:57:38,458 --> 00:57:40,500
I don't know.

997
00:57:40,959 --> 00:57:42,417
I don't know.

998
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,542
Neither do I.

999
00:57:46,125 --> 00:57:49,458
Nobody
understands...

1000
00:57:49,542 --> 00:57:51,083
What all it was,
George.

1001
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:53,083
That's why we got to
stick together.

1002
00:57:53,166 --> 00:57:55,250
We can't quit.

1003
00:57:57,667 --> 00:58:02,417
Then why did you
turn your back
on US, George?

1004
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,542
We needed you.

1005
00:58:03,959 --> 00:58:09,000
That should have
been you up there
today, not me.

1006
00:58:09,083 --> 00:58:12,709
Why didn't you
stick with US? Why?

1007
00:58:12,792 --> 00:58:17,375
George, don't you
know that's where
you belong?

1008
00:58:17,458 --> 00:58:19,625
I'm sorry, Jess.

1009
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:24,333
I just got lost.
I swear.

1010
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:27,583
I'm just lost,
that's all.

1011
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:05,250
This is the part
the politicians
never tell you about.

1012
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:08,542
They're big on glory
and victory and medals,

1013
00:59:08,625 --> 00:59:10,875
all so we don't mind
when some of the boys

1014
00:59:10,959 --> 00:59:13,417
don't come home
in one piece

1015
00:59:13,625 --> 00:59:15,125
or don't come home
at all.

1016
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:17,291
There's an even better
medal for that one.

1017
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:19,041
It'd be nice if it
was that simple, hope.

1018
00:59:19,125 --> 00:59:21,542
But things are a little
more complicated than that.

1019
00:59:21,625 --> 00:59:24,333
Believe me when
you see what I see,

1020
00:59:24,417 --> 00:59:25,458
it is that simple.

1021
00:59:27,208 --> 00:59:29,959
I guess everybody
needs something
to believe in.

1022
00:59:30,041 --> 00:59:33,500
What do you believe in,
George, Tom cantrell?

1023
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,917
What's that
supposed to mean?

1024
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,709
How can you throw in
with cantrell?

1025
00:59:38,792 --> 00:59:40,875
You know who he is.

1026
00:59:40,959 --> 00:59:43,333
He's no better
or worse than any
other politician.

1027
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:46,500
I don't believe you're
that naive or cynical.

1028
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,375
Cantrell knows people
in this town

1029
00:59:49,458 --> 00:59:50,250
look up to you.

1030
00:59:50,583 --> 00:59:52,667
He's using you
to give him the one thing

1031
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:54,500
he cannot buy--
respectability.

1032
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:58,959
I never asked anybody
to look up to me.

1033
00:59:59,041 --> 01:00:01,709
You want to know
what I believe in?

1034
01:00:01,792 --> 01:00:03,709
Maybe I don't believe
in anything anymore.

1035
01:00:03,792 --> 01:00:06,792
Anymore?
When did you ever
believe in anything?

1036
01:00:07,667 --> 01:00:09,417
You've always been
your father's
errand boy.

1037
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,458
Now you're going to
be cantrell's.

1038
01:00:12,792 --> 01:00:15,667
Who the hell are you
to judge me?

1039
01:00:16,208 --> 01:00:18,375
You think you got
all the answers.

1040
01:00:18,458 --> 01:00:22,000
You know what
your problem is?
You're too idealistic.

1041
01:00:22,083 --> 01:00:24,250
It certainly never
was your problem.

1042
01:00:24,333 --> 01:00:27,250
I always saw things
for what they were.

1043
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:30,583
You saw things
for what they
should be.

1044
01:00:30,667 --> 01:00:32,083
That's
exactly right.

1045
01:00:32,166 --> 01:00:35,083
That's why
I married Tim.

1046
01:00:35,166 --> 01:00:38,417
Tim was right
about you, George.

1047
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:41,000
You are dead.

1048
01:00:43,083 --> 01:00:46,959
[Car starts
and drives away]

1049
01:01:55,709 --> 01:01:57,750
George,
are you all right?

1050
01:01:57,834 --> 01:02:00,166
I want you
to call Jesse.

1051
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:02,125
Have him get
everybody together

1052
01:02:02,208 --> 01:02:04,166
and meet me
at the armory
tomorrow, 11:00.

1053
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:06,583
I want hope Tyler
there, too.

1054
01:02:06,667 --> 01:02:08,041
What do I tell him?

1055
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:10,166
Just do it!

1056
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:36,834
You said
I walked out on you,

1057
01:02:36,917 --> 01:02:38,458
I let you down.

1058
01:02:38,542 --> 01:02:40,709
And you're right.

1059
01:02:43,625 --> 01:02:44,458
For a long time

1060
01:02:44,792 --> 01:02:48,709
I didn't really know
where I belonged.

1061
01:02:49,667 --> 01:02:51,709
Now I know.

1062
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,250
If the offer still stands,

1063
01:02:55,333 --> 01:02:57,417
I'd like to run
for mayor...

1064
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:58,625
Of the veterans party.

1065
01:02:58,709 --> 01:03:01,291
We're only going
to have one chance.

1066
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,834
We've got to make it count.

1067
01:03:02,917 --> 01:03:04,917
It's going to mean
hitting the streets,

1068
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:05,792
knocking on doors.

1069
01:03:06,333 --> 01:03:09,291
It'll take every minute
until the election.

1070
01:03:10,291 --> 01:03:12,250
We've got
to take this message

1071
01:03:12,333 --> 01:03:14,250
to everybody
in this county.

1072
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:17,250
If everyone who's
complaining about cantrell

1073
01:03:17,333 --> 01:03:19,125
votes for US,

1074
01:03:19,208 --> 01:03:21,083
he won't have a chance.

1075
01:03:21,166 --> 01:03:23,208
If they don't,
they deserve him.

1076
01:03:23,291 --> 01:03:27,125
Was it the war
that made you
so self-destructive

1077
01:03:27,208 --> 01:03:28,875
or just
plain stupid?

1078
01:03:28,959 --> 01:03:30,375
I'm sorry
it embarrasses you.

1079
01:03:30,458 --> 01:03:32,375
You have
embarrassed yourself.

1080
01:03:32,458 --> 01:03:34,500
You could've ridden
cantrell's coattails

1081
01:03:34,583 --> 01:03:35,542
right to the capitol.

1082
01:03:35,625 --> 01:03:37,291
No, you threw in
with losers

1083
01:03:37,375 --> 01:03:38,583
to shake everybody up.

1084
01:03:38,667 --> 01:03:40,834
They won
the war for you.

1085
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:42,166
I am warning
you George.

1086
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:44,500
You're taking on
the wrong man.

1087
01:03:44,583 --> 01:03:47,291
If you lose,
and you will,

1088
01:03:47,375 --> 01:03:50,041
your name won't be
worth a good spit.

1089
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:52,166
You'll have to start
over elsewhere.

1090
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:55,625
Tom cantrell has
a very long reach.

1091
01:03:55,709 --> 01:03:57,875
Tom cantrell's time
is up.

1092
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,792
He'd better face it,

1093
01:03:59,875 --> 01:04:01,834
and you
better face it.

1094
01:04:01,917 --> 01:04:03,500
There's something else
you should keep in mind.

1095
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:07,667
You've got less
than 30 days

1096
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:08,667
to mount a campaign.

1097
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:10,709
You'll need a miracle,

1098
01:04:10,792 --> 01:04:11,875
and that doesn't
come cheap.

1099
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:14,792
You'll have to look to
a lot of people
for favors.

1100
01:04:16,709 --> 01:04:18,500
If the miracle
should happen,

1101
01:04:18,583 --> 01:04:20,458
don't think
they won't collect.

1102
01:04:20,542 --> 01:04:23,375
You've got to give
to get in this business.

1103
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:27,500
In a year,
or maybe two,

1104
01:04:27,583 --> 01:04:30,166
you'll be doing
the same things

1105
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:31,750
you hate cantrell
for now.

1106
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:37,041
It's the nature
of the beast, George.

1107
01:04:42,583 --> 01:04:45,542
Have I failed you
in some way?

1108
01:04:45,625 --> 01:04:48,041
Is this some
childish rebellion?

1109
01:04:48,125 --> 01:04:52,041
I know this
may come as a shock,

1110
01:04:52,125 --> 01:04:54,417
but this has nothing
to do with you.

1111
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:58,458
Then tell me
what it does
have to do with.

1112
01:04:58,542 --> 01:05:00,375
You wouldn't understand.

1113
01:05:00,458 --> 01:05:02,750
Don't condescend to me,
George.

1114
01:05:02,834 --> 01:05:05,083
I don't deserve that.

1115
01:05:05,166 --> 01:05:05,917
Barbara, all my life

1116
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:09,375
I've let other people
call the shots.

1117
01:05:09,458 --> 01:05:11,542
I can't do it anymore.

1118
01:05:11,625 --> 01:05:12,333
I won't.

1119
01:05:12,625 --> 01:05:14,709
By other people,
you mean me.

1120
01:05:14,792 --> 01:05:17,083
I mean my father,
cantrell,

1121
01:05:17,166 --> 01:05:19,000
and yes, I mean you.

1122
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:22,834
So I'm to blame
for you throwing away
your political career?

1123
01:05:22,917 --> 01:05:24,250
Would you listen to me?

1124
01:05:24,333 --> 01:05:26,583
For once, listen!

1125
01:05:26,667 --> 01:05:29,250
It has nothing
to do with blame.

1126
01:05:29,333 --> 01:05:30,709
If you want to blame
someone, blame me.

1127
01:05:30,792 --> 01:05:33,125
I let it happen.
I never took responsibility.

1128
01:05:33,208 --> 01:05:37,250
But now I am.
Now I have to.

1129
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:39,834
What about your
responsibility to me?

1130
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:44,458
I invested
my whole life in you.

1131
01:05:44,542 --> 01:05:46,583
You needed someone
to push you.

1132
01:05:46,667 --> 01:05:47,667
If it wasn't for me,

1133
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:48,959
you'd have been content

1134
01:05:49,041 --> 01:05:51,166
to drift
into nothingness.

1135
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,667
You owe me.

1136
01:06:10,417 --> 01:06:12,792
Barbara...

1137
01:06:14,458 --> 01:06:16,917
I am drifting.

1138
01:06:17,959 --> 01:06:21,000
That's all
I've ever done.

1139
01:06:22,417 --> 01:06:24,291
Except for
during the war

1140
01:06:24,375 --> 01:06:27,792
when I stood
for something.

1141
01:06:27,875 --> 01:06:30,000
I fought for what
I believed in,

1142
01:06:30,083 --> 01:06:31,333
and it felt good.

1143
01:06:31,417 --> 01:06:32,750
Then I came home,

1144
01:06:32,834 --> 01:06:33,875
and you wanted
everything to be

1145
01:06:33,959 --> 01:06:36,792
just like it was,
like I'd never left.

1146
01:06:36,875 --> 01:06:38,083
And I tried.

1147
01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:41,625
Really, Barbara,
I tried, but...

1148
01:06:42,417 --> 01:06:45,291
But that's
all gone now.

1149
01:06:45,875 --> 01:06:47,917
I need to find
something

1150
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,083
that I can
believe in again.

1151
01:06:50,166 --> 01:06:54,083
Now I have a chance
here to do something
good,

1152
01:06:54,166 --> 01:06:57,417
something
that can really
make a difference.

1153
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:01,417
And I'm going
to take it.

1154
01:07:03,834 --> 01:07:06,208
Why didn't
you ever tell me

1155
01:07:06,291 --> 01:07:08,458
you felt this way?

1156
01:07:11,333 --> 01:07:12,417
I tried...

1157
01:07:12,792 --> 01:07:17,875
But you were too busy
planning my future
to hear me.

1158
01:07:19,959 --> 01:07:21,959
All right, George.

1159
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:24,667
You've
made yourself clear.

1160
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:25,917
You've chosen your course.

1161
01:07:26,583 --> 01:07:30,000
I won't stand
in your way.

1162
01:07:31,542 --> 01:07:34,000
But I want you to know

1163
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:37,959
I have no intention

1164
01:07:38,041 --> 01:07:40,125
of letting you
drag me down with you.

1165
01:07:42,875 --> 01:07:46,458
I won't be married
to a loser.

1166
01:07:46,834 --> 01:07:50,041
There's a price
for everything, George.

1167
01:07:51,083 --> 01:07:53,834
Maybe you should
think about that.

1168
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,709
If we fought
for democracy

1169
01:08:01,792 --> 01:08:04,125
on the battlefields of Europe
and in the pacific,

1170
01:08:04,208 --> 01:08:08,917
why can't we have it
in our own town?

1171
01:08:13,959 --> 01:08:16,792
Because Tom cantrell
won't let US,

1172
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:17,458
that's why.

1173
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,709
On election day
I want you to say no

1174
01:08:20,792 --> 01:08:22,667
to the cantrell machine.

1175
01:08:28,041 --> 01:08:29,959
We must have the courage

1176
01:08:30,041 --> 01:08:31,166
to believe in ourselves,

1177
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:34,792
to believe that we can
make a difference,

1178
01:08:34,875 --> 01:08:37,375
that our vote
does count.

1179
01:08:39,083 --> 01:08:41,208
And believe this...

1180
01:08:41,625 --> 01:08:44,250
Every vote
for the veterans party

1181
01:08:44,333 --> 01:08:46,792
is a vote for yourselves!

1182
01:09:07,166 --> 01:09:08,709
Gotten a little rusty,
Henry.

1183
01:09:08,792 --> 01:09:12,041
Yeah, well, I don't get
to play much anymore.

1184
01:09:12,125 --> 01:09:14,125
Things busy
at the office?

1185
01:09:14,208 --> 01:09:16,291
It's been
a good year.

1186
01:09:16,375 --> 01:09:17,583
Glad to hear it.

1187
01:09:17,667 --> 01:09:18,959
You know, uh...

1188
01:09:19,041 --> 01:09:21,625
I like to think
I've had a hand

1189
01:09:21,709 --> 01:09:23,542
in helping
your firm along.

1190
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,875
Yes, Tom,
you've been good to US.

1191
01:09:26,959 --> 01:09:28,125
Happy to do it.

1192
01:09:28,291 --> 01:09:29,625
Happy to do it.

1193
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:34,208
Of course,
I don't think
I have to tell you

1194
01:09:34,291 --> 01:09:36,375
how disappointed
I am in George.

1195
01:09:37,291 --> 01:09:38,125
No, you don't.

1196
01:09:38,959 --> 01:09:41,709
He has said some
very distressing
things--

1197
01:09:41,792 --> 01:09:42,583
slanderous, really.

1198
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,542
I was hoping
you might have
a word with him,

1199
01:09:45,625 --> 01:09:48,542
see if he would
tone down his rhetoric.

1200
01:09:48,625 --> 01:09:51,083
Don't tell me
you're getting nervous.

1201
01:09:52,083 --> 01:09:54,041
A good politician's
always nervous.

1202
01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:55,917
Of course, George is
going to lose,

1203
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,125
but there's no point

1204
01:09:57,208 --> 01:09:59,875
in putting ideas
in people's heads,

1205
01:09:59,959 --> 01:10:01,625
make them restless.

1206
01:10:01,709 --> 01:10:05,709
What makes you so sure
he's going to lose?

1207
01:10:05,792 --> 01:10:07,250
The Mexican.

1208
01:10:10,792 --> 01:10:11,625
The Mexican.

1209
01:10:13,041 --> 01:10:14,792
Nobody's going to vote
for the veterans party

1210
01:10:14,875 --> 01:10:16,333
while a Mexican's
on the ballot.

1211
01:10:16,417 --> 01:10:17,917
Not in this town.

1212
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,959
Not any town
I know.

1213
01:10:21,208 --> 01:10:22,917
Am I wrong?

1214
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,250
No.

1215
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:28,375
You're exactly right.

1216
01:10:28,458 --> 01:10:32,834
Henry, why don't you
tell George

1217
01:10:32,917 --> 01:10:34,083
that he's made his point?

1218
01:10:34,291 --> 01:10:35,125
After the election's over,

1219
01:10:35,625 --> 01:10:38,250
I'd be more than willing
to sit down and discuss

1220
01:10:38,333 --> 01:10:40,792
his beloved veterans,
see what I can do.

1221
01:10:41,333 --> 01:10:43,542
He'll come out of this
smelling like a Rose.

1222
01:10:43,625 --> 01:10:46,917
But for now,
he's got to stop
slinging mud

1223
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,625
and behave
like a gentleman.

1224
01:10:51,041 --> 01:10:54,000
I can't get through
to him anymore than you.

1225
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:55,000
He's changed.

1226
01:10:55,875 --> 01:10:57,750
He's his own man now.

1227
01:10:57,834 --> 01:11:00,500
Well, you're
his father, Henry.

1228
01:11:01,417 --> 01:11:03,834
I'm depending on you.

1229
01:11:15,208 --> 01:11:16,458
What's it say?

1230
01:11:16,542 --> 01:11:18,875
If the election
were held today,

1231
01:11:18,959 --> 01:11:22,667
it would still
be cantrell by 2 to 1.

1232
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:23,875
How about the phones?

1233
01:11:23,959 --> 01:11:26,875
Lots of support,
lots of good lucks,

1234
01:11:26,959 --> 01:11:29,000
but very few
committing either way.

1235
01:11:29,083 --> 01:11:31,291
Well, time
for more radio.

1236
01:11:31,875 --> 01:11:33,959
[Knock on door]

1237
01:11:37,625 --> 01:11:39,417
You might as well know,

1238
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:42,333
I'm supposed to be here
to call you off.

1239
01:11:42,417 --> 01:11:43,250
Cantrell.

1240
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:45,917
He wants to make a deal.

1241
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,041
Stop exposing him
for the thief he is,

1242
01:11:49,125 --> 01:11:50,542
he'll take care
of the veterans

1243
01:11:50,625 --> 01:11:51,834
after the election.

1244
01:11:51,917 --> 01:11:53,792
I'm sure
if you press him,

1245
01:11:53,875 --> 01:11:57,041
he'll even suspend
the business licensing
requirements,

1246
01:11:57,125 --> 01:11:58,208
maybe even some taxes.

1247
01:11:58,291 --> 01:12:00,458
You mean the bribes.

1248
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:05,542
All this is assuming
that I lose.

1249
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:07,875
It's a pretty safe
assumption.

1250
01:12:07,959 --> 01:12:10,000
You know that.

1251
01:12:12,959 --> 01:12:13,917
But I don't understand.

1252
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,291
Everywhere we go,
people cheer US.

1253
01:12:16,375 --> 01:12:17,500
It'll take more than
a few hundred veterans

1254
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:18,792
to turn the tide.

1255
01:12:18,875 --> 01:12:20,041
It'll take more than
a few hundred veterans

1256
01:12:21,333 --> 01:12:24,458
will he keep his word?

1257
01:12:25,083 --> 01:12:26,959
He will.

1258
01:12:30,166 --> 01:12:32,291
I don't know.

1259
01:12:32,875 --> 01:12:35,458
What do you think, dad?

1260
01:12:35,542 --> 01:12:37,083
The truth?

1261
01:12:37,166 --> 01:12:38,000
A few weeks ago

1262
01:12:38,333 --> 01:12:40,208
I would've told you
to make the deal,

1263
01:12:40,291 --> 01:12:41,750
but everything's
changing, George.

1264
01:12:42,792 --> 01:12:45,417
The town's changed.
You've changed.

1265
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,208
I don't know what
surprises me more--

1266
01:12:47,291 --> 01:12:50,125
that you made
a believer of me
or of yourself.

1267
01:12:50,208 --> 01:12:51,792
Either way
it scares me.

1268
01:12:52,542 --> 01:12:55,500
I'm too old
to have everything
shifting,

1269
01:12:57,417 --> 01:12:59,834
but even I can see
cantrell's
got to go.

1270
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:01,166
He's out of control.

1271
01:13:02,417 --> 01:13:03,625
He's gone too far.

1272
01:13:03,709 --> 01:13:07,291
We were friends,
you know...

1273
01:13:08,041 --> 01:13:11,083
Ever since
we were children.

1274
01:13:11,792 --> 01:13:14,959
That's
a long time ago.

1275
01:13:17,583 --> 01:13:21,125
George, you
really want to win
this election?

1276
01:13:21,208 --> 01:13:22,834
Of course I do.

1277
01:13:22,917 --> 01:13:24,041
You know I do.

1278
01:13:24,417 --> 01:13:27,875
Are you willing to do
what it takes--
be ruthless?

1279
01:13:27,959 --> 01:13:29,208
Well, I don't under--

1280
01:13:29,291 --> 01:13:31,166
what are you
talking about?

1281
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:34,208
You've got to
take Juan Medina
off the ballot.

1282
01:13:35,083 --> 01:13:37,625
Nobody's going to
vote for a Mexican.

1283
01:13:37,709 --> 01:13:39,417
The town's
not ready for it.

1284
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:40,583
It's that simple.

1285
01:13:40,667 --> 01:13:43,208
I won't.
He's one of US.

1286
01:13:43,291 --> 01:13:47,458
Is he worth
losing the election for?

1287
01:13:48,166 --> 01:13:51,583
We're not talking about
right or wrong here.

1288
01:13:52,834 --> 01:13:54,208
We're talking
about reality.

1289
01:13:54,291 --> 01:13:56,625
We're talking
about politics.

1290
01:13:57,208 --> 01:13:58,083
With him, you lose.

1291
01:13:58,166 --> 01:14:01,625
Without him,
you've got a chance.

1292
01:14:01,709 --> 01:14:04,917
It's up to you,
George.

1293
01:14:10,542 --> 01:14:14,375
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

1294
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,625
Let's take a look
at this.

1295
01:14:17,709 --> 01:14:19,458
Take a look at what?

1296
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:21,291
Johnny won
a bronze star.

1297
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:22,417
The man's a hero.

1298
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,500
We know
Johnny's the best.

1299
01:14:24,583 --> 01:14:26,083
We're talking about
something bigger.

1300
01:14:26,166 --> 01:14:30,083
We're talking
about the color
of a man's skin.

1301
01:14:30,166 --> 01:14:31,834
I don't like it either,

1302
01:14:31,917 --> 01:14:34,959
but not many people
will vote for US

1303
01:14:35,041 --> 01:14:36,792
if Juan's on the ticket.

1304
01:14:36,875 --> 01:14:39,625
Does anybody think
I'm wrong?

1305
01:14:39,709 --> 01:14:42,208
George is right.
We have to think
about this.

1306
01:14:42,291 --> 01:14:43,500
We're taking a chance.

1307
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:47,667
I thought that was
the whole point.

1308
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:49,041
We're here
to make changes.

1309
01:14:49,125 --> 01:14:50,917
You can't change
people's attitudes
overnight.

1310
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,041
How will
those attitudes change?

1311
01:14:53,125 --> 01:14:55,000
We have
to take a chance.

1312
01:14:55,875 --> 01:14:57,959
We're already trying
the impossible.

1313
01:14:58,041 --> 01:15:00,333
So what's
best for the town,

1314
01:15:00,417 --> 01:15:02,208
that we lose
on principle

1315
01:15:02,291 --> 01:15:04,333
or we compromise
and win?

1316
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:06,000
That's not the point!

1317
01:15:06,083 --> 01:15:08,417
If that's not it,
what is?

1318
01:15:09,291 --> 01:15:12,166
The point is
we're supposed
to be equals.

1319
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:15,458
We're supposed
to stand for something
better than cantrell.

1320
01:15:15,542 --> 01:15:20,291
But what good
will that do US
if we lose?

1321
01:15:23,625 --> 01:15:27,917
Walking out on US isn't
going to make it go away.

1322
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,542
I can't sit here
and be part of this.

1323
01:15:31,625 --> 01:15:33,291
If we compromise this
today,

1324
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:36,333
what will we compromise
tomorrow?

1325
01:15:41,583 --> 01:15:44,166
[Door closes]

1326
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:14,208
[Knock on door]

1327
01:16:21,709 --> 01:16:22,417
Johnny...

1328
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,291
Why don't you come in?

1329
01:16:24,375 --> 01:16:28,250
No, George. I can
only stay a minute.

1330
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:34,083
Look, John--

1331
01:16:34,166 --> 01:16:34,750
the thing is, George,

1332
01:16:35,125 --> 01:16:37,625
I hate to do this
to you now,

1333
01:16:38,583 --> 01:16:41,667
but I'll have to
drop out of the race.

1334
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:44,709
Wait a minute.
What are you
talking about?

1335
01:16:44,792 --> 01:16:46,417
Well...

1336
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,667
I'm thinking about it.

1337
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:52,792
Maybe I don't really
want to stay here...

1338
01:16:52,875 --> 01:16:55,375
This place, this town.

1339
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,792
Maybe it's time
to move on.

1340
01:16:59,166 --> 01:17:00,625
I'm sorry, George.

1341
01:17:00,709 --> 01:17:02,542
I didn't mean
to let you down.

1342
01:17:03,542 --> 01:17:04,709
Now, look, Johnny.

1343
01:17:05,583 --> 01:17:07,083
I don't know
what you've heard,

1344
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:09,417
but you're not
off the ticket.

1345
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:11,625
There's been
a lot of talk--

1346
01:17:11,709 --> 01:17:13,875
it doesn't matter.

1347
01:17:13,959 --> 01:17:16,041
I won't cost US
the election,

1348
01:17:16,125 --> 01:17:19,542
and I'm not
going to wait
to be kicked out.

1349
01:17:20,208 --> 01:17:22,875
Either way, I lose.

1350
01:17:25,667 --> 01:17:27,959
It's a relief,
isn't it, George?

1351
01:17:28,041 --> 01:17:30,834
It's not that way,
Johnny.

1352
01:17:30,917 --> 01:17:32,333
Yeah, well...

1353
01:17:32,417 --> 01:17:34,291
Why don't you
tell me someday

1354
01:17:34,375 --> 01:17:36,458
what way it is,
o.K., amigo?

1355
01:17:37,125 --> 01:17:40,083
If we win,
we'll make things
change, Johnny.

1356
01:17:40,166 --> 01:17:42,208
I promise that.

1357
01:17:44,125 --> 01:17:46,417
Congratulations, George.

1358
01:17:47,458 --> 01:17:50,834
You're
a real politician now.

1359
01:17:58,625 --> 01:18:02,125
There's nothing here
for US anymore.

1360
01:18:02,208 --> 01:18:03,750
No future.

1361
01:18:05,166 --> 01:18:07,208
How can I
have children here,

1362
01:18:07,291 --> 01:18:10,125
in a place where a man
can't get ahead?

1363
01:18:10,208 --> 01:18:13,041
You have to live
in your own world.

1364
01:18:13,125 --> 01:18:15,500
This is where
you come from,

1365
01:18:15,583 --> 01:18:17,959
this is where
you should stay.

1366
01:18:18,041 --> 01:18:21,917
Out there
is only pain for you.

1367
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,125
I can't.

1368
01:18:24,208 --> 01:18:26,709
Papa, I can't.

1369
01:18:26,792 --> 01:18:29,000
I'm not like you.

1370
01:18:29,083 --> 01:18:31,417
The army showed me
what's out there,

1371
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:32,959
what a man can be.

1372
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:36,417
I have seen
what's out there.

1373
01:18:36,625 --> 01:18:38,542
Here you have
your family,

1374
01:18:38,625 --> 01:18:42,500
people
who understand you.

1375
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:45,542
Papa...

1376
01:18:45,917 --> 01:18:49,792
I think I'm going
to take Maria
to California.

1377
01:18:54,542 --> 01:18:57,375
We'll live
like people there,
not like animals.

1378
01:18:57,458 --> 01:19:01,750
What makes you believe
it'll be any different
in California?

1379
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:05,125
It has to be.

1380
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:07,625
No, it doesn't.

1381
01:19:24,166 --> 01:19:27,500
Stay for
a little longer, Juan.

1382
01:19:27,583 --> 01:19:31,166
I just got you back.

1383
01:19:33,333 --> 01:19:35,542
O.k., papa.

1384
01:19:37,125 --> 01:19:39,125
O.k.

1385
01:20:15,083 --> 01:20:17,375
You seen the polls?

1386
01:20:17,458 --> 01:20:19,375
Oh, yeah.

1387
01:20:19,458 --> 01:20:20,917
And we're catching up.

1388
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,041
Some even have US
slightly ahead.

1389
01:20:23,125 --> 01:20:28,709
It's amazing
what the sacrifice
of a human being can do,

1390
01:20:28,792 --> 01:20:30,458
isn't it?

1391
01:20:30,542 --> 01:20:33,083
You want a drink?

1392
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:41,208
Tough week for you,
George.

1393
01:20:41,291 --> 01:20:44,000
It's lonely at the top.

1394
01:20:50,792 --> 01:20:52,417
Here's to election day,

1395
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:53,709
a mere...

1396
01:20:53,792 --> 01:20:56,500
A mere eight hours away.

1397
01:21:02,792 --> 01:21:06,917
I guess I've been
pretty tough on you,
George.

1398
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,500
Somebody had to be.

1399
01:21:08,583 --> 01:21:10,208
I wasn't up to it.

1400
01:21:10,291 --> 01:21:11,542
I don't know.

1401
01:21:11,625 --> 01:21:14,208
This whole thing
with Juan...

1402
01:21:15,125 --> 01:21:18,333
I knew you were
in a tough spot,

1403
01:21:18,417 --> 01:21:20,959
and I know there was
no easy answer,

1404
01:21:21,041 --> 01:21:24,959
but it all
just makes me feel...

1405
01:21:25,959 --> 01:21:27,959
Corrupted.

1406
01:21:29,583 --> 01:21:32,000
Welcome to the club.

1407
01:21:34,041 --> 01:21:39,458
You know, I can still
see you in that garden.

1408
01:21:42,166 --> 01:21:47,166
I don't know
how many times
I've thought about that.

1409
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:50,208
It was just a glance...

1410
01:21:50,291 --> 01:21:54,917
But it stayed with me
a long time.

1411
01:21:59,709 --> 01:22:03,041
Get some sleep, George.

1412
01:22:03,375 --> 01:22:05,041
You, too.

1413
01:22:44,667 --> 01:22:47,083
You bet. Uh-huh.

1414
01:22:47,166 --> 01:22:49,875
Mrs. Ferguson
needs a ride in.

1415
01:22:49,959 --> 01:22:50,875
She can't drive.

1416
01:22:51,208 --> 01:22:55,792
We want
to get her in
so she can vote.

1417
01:22:55,875 --> 01:22:57,542
Could you do that?

1418
01:22:57,625 --> 01:23:00,166
Oh, that'd be--
that'd be great.

1419
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:03,542
We really
appreciate it.

1420
01:23:09,959 --> 01:23:13,959
This is all happening
because of you.

1421
01:23:15,208 --> 01:23:16,959
Nobody
believed in you.

1422
01:23:17,041 --> 01:23:21,458
You went ahead
and did it anyway.

1423
01:23:23,250 --> 01:23:25,500
You're a hero,
Jesse.

1424
01:23:25,583 --> 01:23:28,000
Don't forget that.

1425
01:23:30,041 --> 01:23:31,750
Becky...

1426
01:23:38,083 --> 01:23:39,250
Um...

1427
01:23:39,333 --> 01:23:43,625
Um, I know I never
said this to you,

1428
01:23:43,709 --> 01:23:46,792
but...
When I got shot,

1429
01:23:46,875 --> 01:23:49,000
they told me I might
lose my memories,

1430
01:23:49,083 --> 01:23:54,458
so all I did
was think about you

1431
01:23:54,542 --> 01:23:56,542
and Sam and...

1432
01:23:56,625 --> 01:24:00,166
Everything
we've been through.

1433
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:03,208
I tried to remember
every little thing

1434
01:24:03,291 --> 01:24:07,542
in case I never
remembered it again.

1435
01:24:09,875 --> 01:24:12,542
It made me realize...

1436
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,625
We--

1437
01:24:17,583 --> 01:24:22,542
it made me realize
how lucky I am.

1438
01:24:23,583 --> 01:24:25,250
And...

1439
01:24:25,333 --> 01:24:28,041
You got me through it...

1440
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:32,125
Whether
you know it or not.

1441
01:24:33,875 --> 01:24:36,250
And don't think
I don't know

1442
01:24:36,333 --> 01:24:38,542
you ran this factory
better than I could.

1443
01:24:39,709 --> 01:24:42,500
You kept
everything going.

1444
01:24:44,792 --> 01:24:47,625
And if
anybody's a hero...

1445
01:24:50,083 --> 01:24:51,583
It's you.

1446
01:24:58,917 --> 01:25:00,125
So far...

1447
01:25:00,208 --> 01:25:01,875
It's veterans party...

1448
01:25:01,959 --> 01:25:02,792
Yes...

1449
01:25:02,875 --> 01:25:04,917
2 to 1!

1450
01:25:09,917 --> 01:25:13,083
They're saying it's 2 to 1,
veterans.

1451
01:25:13,166 --> 01:25:15,875
Is it slowing down any?

1452
01:25:15,959 --> 01:25:17,000
How's it looking?

1453
01:25:17,375 --> 01:25:22,000
They're still lining up
around the block to vote.

1454
01:25:22,083 --> 01:25:26,625
Well, I think
it's about time
the polls were closed,

1455
01:25:26,709 --> 01:25:28,000
don't you?

1456
01:25:28,709 --> 01:25:30,000
Deputize everybody
you can.

1457
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,917
Meet me
at the post office.

1458
01:25:33,750 --> 01:25:35,417
Let's go.

1459
01:26:01,166 --> 01:26:03,542
These polls are
officially closed!

1460
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:04,458
Everybody out!

1461
01:26:04,542 --> 01:26:05,417
What are you doing?

1462
01:26:05,792 --> 01:26:08,875
I'm warning everybody
to leave these premises.

1463
01:26:08,959 --> 01:26:09,875
The polls are closed.

1464
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:11,875
Like hell! These people
came here to vote--

1465
01:26:13,667 --> 01:26:15,750
damn it, Curtis!

1466
01:26:17,333 --> 01:26:18,750
Yeah?

1467
01:26:20,333 --> 01:26:21,709
What?

1468
01:26:21,792 --> 01:26:24,250
All right.

1469
01:26:26,458 --> 01:26:29,750
Jack just got shot
at the post office.

1470
01:26:29,834 --> 01:26:31,041
Mcmillan's
got an army there.

1471
01:26:31,125 --> 01:26:32,500
They closed the polls.

1472
01:26:32,709 --> 01:26:33,375
Hey, Billy,

1473
01:26:33,667 --> 01:26:36,667
you got the keys
to the armory?

1474
01:26:36,750 --> 01:26:38,834
Let's go.

1475
01:26:38,917 --> 01:26:41,875
Hold on.

1476
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:49,417
Stay out of this, George!
You stay back!

1477
01:26:50,583 --> 01:26:53,583
There's a man hurt
in there.

1478
01:26:53,667 --> 01:26:55,625
He needs help.

1479
01:27:04,959 --> 01:27:08,542
I don't want to shoot you,
George, but I will.

1480
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,750
We're taking
what we came for

1481
01:27:11,834 --> 01:27:12,959
and getting out of here.

1482
01:27:15,709 --> 01:27:18,000
Ow! My back!

1483
01:27:18,083 --> 01:27:18,917
O.k.

1484
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,250
It'll be all right.

1485
01:27:20,333 --> 01:27:22,583
O.k., let's him get up.

1486
01:27:22,667 --> 01:27:25,041
What are you
waiting for?

1487
01:27:25,125 --> 01:27:26,166
Get his legs!

1488
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:27,583
We're losing some blood.

1489
01:27:27,667 --> 01:27:29,959
Let's go!
Get his legs!

1490
01:27:30,041 --> 01:27:31,333
All right.

1491
01:27:32,458 --> 01:27:33,959
Come on!

1492
01:27:41,208 --> 01:27:45,291
Tell cantrell
he's gone too far
this time, mcmillan.

1493
01:27:45,375 --> 01:27:46,458
It's all your fault!

1494
01:27:46,542 --> 01:27:49,083
You should've
kept your mouth shut

1495
01:27:49,166 --> 01:27:52,000
and minded
your own business!

1496
01:27:54,041 --> 01:27:58,000
What the hell
we do now, George?

1497
01:28:38,542 --> 01:28:39,542
Lets go.

1498
01:29:04,542 --> 01:29:06,792
Don't move in
until I tell you.

1499
01:29:06,875 --> 01:29:10,083
We don't want anybody
to get hurt.

1500
01:29:10,166 --> 01:29:11,667
All right.

1501
01:29:12,875 --> 01:29:15,291
George,
what's going on?

1502
01:29:15,375 --> 01:29:16,291
They took
the ballot boxes.

1503
01:29:16,375 --> 01:29:17,417
We're
getting them back.

1504
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:18,125
With guns?

1505
01:29:18,208 --> 01:29:19,000
If necessary, yes.

1506
01:29:19,083 --> 01:29:22,166
George,
we can't start a war.

1507
01:29:22,625 --> 01:29:23,750
Slow down a minute.

1508
01:29:23,834 --> 01:29:25,709
We can't really
call the police.

1509
01:29:25,792 --> 01:29:26,834
Call the governor.

1510
01:29:26,917 --> 01:29:29,458
You're playing into
cantrell's hands.

1511
01:29:29,542 --> 01:29:31,458
The governor's
on cantrell's side.

1512
01:29:31,542 --> 01:29:32,542
We're out of time.

1513
01:29:32,625 --> 01:29:33,875
They'll
count the votes,

1514
01:29:33,959 --> 01:29:35,417
he'll declare
himself the winner.

1515
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:37,250
We can't let this happen,
people are going to get hurt.

1516
01:29:37,333 --> 01:29:39,792
Why does it always have
to come down to a war?

1517
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:41,750
You want to know why,
hope?

1518
01:29:41,834 --> 01:29:44,792
Because some people
can't be reasoned with.

1519
01:29:44,875 --> 01:29:49,542
Who are you talking about,
you or cantrell?

1520
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:57,583
You better put
the governor on right now.

1521
01:29:57,667 --> 01:29:59,709
Tell him
it's Tom cantrell,

1522
01:29:59,792 --> 01:30:01,500
and it's an emergency!

1523
01:30:01,583 --> 01:30:04,917
How many of them
are out there?

1524
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:05,959
Every 10 minutes,

1525
01:30:06,291 --> 01:30:09,458
another farmer
with a shotgun
pulls up.

1526
01:30:09,542 --> 01:30:10,417
Earl!

1527
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:13,625
Yeah, you better believe
it's important.

1528
01:30:13,709 --> 01:30:15,917
I've got renegade veterans
with guns

1529
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:16,917
surrounding my jail.

1530
01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:20,375
They're trying to steal
the ballot boxes,

1531
01:30:20,458 --> 01:30:21,208
that's what.

1532
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:23,208
I don't know how many.

1533
01:30:23,291 --> 01:30:24,417
There's 100, maybe 200.

1534
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:27,750
I need some help,
and I need it fast.

1535
01:30:28,917 --> 01:30:30,750
Yes, Earl, I have men,

1536
01:30:30,834 --> 01:30:32,000
but I don't have enough--

1537
01:30:32,083 --> 01:30:33,333
yeah.

1538
01:30:33,792 --> 01:30:34,917
Yes, all right.

1539
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,792
You just hurry,
understand?

1540
01:30:36,875 --> 01:30:38,959
Someday we'll see
how fast I move

1541
01:30:39,041 --> 01:30:40,792
when your back's
against the wall.

1542
01:30:40,875 --> 01:30:42,125
Cover the window.

1543
01:30:44,959 --> 01:30:46,583
What'd he say?

1544
01:30:46,667 --> 01:30:49,041
He's going to mobilize
the national guard.

1545
01:30:49,125 --> 01:30:51,542
We'll have to sit tight
and wait.

1546
01:30:51,625 --> 01:30:54,166
Let's do what
we came here to do.

1547
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:56,250
Open it up!

1548
01:31:01,333 --> 01:31:04,333
Tom, this is George Meade!

1549
01:31:04,417 --> 01:31:06,250
We want
two of your deputies

1550
01:31:06,333 --> 01:31:10,917
to come down, unarmed,
with the ballot boxes,

1551
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
set them down
in the middle of the street.

1552
01:31:13,083 --> 01:31:15,083
We'll do an official count,

1553
01:31:15,166 --> 01:31:16,959
then we can all go home.

1554
01:31:17,834 --> 01:31:20,875
Now, if I don't see
that ballot box

1555
01:31:20,959 --> 01:31:23,291
come through that door
in one minute,

1556
01:31:23,375 --> 01:31:26,542
we're going to open fire.

1557
01:31:26,625 --> 01:31:29,625
You got 60 seconds.

1558
01:31:39,959 --> 01:31:40,667
20!

1559
01:31:40,959 --> 01:31:43,250
You're out of your mind,
George,

1560
01:31:43,333 --> 01:31:45,375
we're the law here,
not you.

1561
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:49,291
The national guard's
on its way--

1562
01:31:50,291 --> 01:31:52,667
who fired that shot?

1563
01:31:57,875 --> 01:31:58,792
Jesse!

1564
01:31:58,875 --> 01:32:01,250
Jesse!

1565
01:32:22,208 --> 01:32:23,625
Hold your fire!

1566
01:32:23,709 --> 01:32:25,959
Hold your fire!

1567
01:32:26,041 --> 01:32:27,667
Hold your fire!

1568
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:29,000
Hold your fire!

1569
01:32:29,083 --> 01:32:31,625
Is anybody hit?

1570
01:32:31,709 --> 01:32:34,834
This is crazy!
Give them what they want!

1571
01:32:34,917 --> 01:32:36,750
They're going to kill US!

1572
01:32:36,834 --> 01:32:38,000
Shut up!

1573
01:32:38,083 --> 01:32:39,125
Now, keep calm!

1574
01:32:39,208 --> 01:32:41,667
They'll never
get in this building.

1575
01:32:41,750 --> 01:32:45,667
We're safe here
till help comes.

1576
01:32:46,917 --> 01:32:48,125
You heard them.

1577
01:32:48,542 --> 01:32:51,959
The national guard
will shoot first,
ask questions later.

1578
01:32:52,041 --> 01:32:54,750
We'll go to prison,
if they don't
kill US first.

1579
01:32:54,834 --> 01:32:59,083
We got to get
those ballot boxes
before the guard comes.

1580
01:32:59,166 --> 01:33:00,583
If we can do that,

1581
01:33:00,667 --> 01:33:03,750
we can tell
our side of the story.

1582
01:33:03,834 --> 01:33:05,875
The whole town's
our witness.

1583
01:33:05,959 --> 01:33:07,125
So what are we
going to do George?

1584
01:33:07,208 --> 01:33:08,583
The brick's too solid.

1585
01:33:08,667 --> 01:33:09,834
We can't shoot through.

1586
01:33:09,917 --> 01:33:12,333
They can stay in there
all night.

1587
01:33:12,417 --> 01:33:14,709
We'll just have
to blow it.

1588
01:34:01,250 --> 01:34:03,166
Ready.

1589
01:34:10,959 --> 01:34:15,166
We turned our backs
on you, Johnny,

1590
01:34:16,291 --> 01:34:17,500
let you walk away.

1591
01:34:18,333 --> 01:34:20,917
Nobody
would blame you
for staying away.

1592
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,166
It's different
when it's war.

1593
01:34:23,709 --> 01:34:25,625
Yeah, but
it shouldn't be.

1594
01:34:25,709 --> 01:34:27,458
I'm not doing this
for you.

1595
01:34:27,542 --> 01:34:29,709
I'm doing this
to get rid of cantrell.

1596
01:34:29,792 --> 01:34:34,166
I'm doing it because
this is my town, too.

1597
01:34:37,667 --> 01:34:40,542
Put your head down,
amigo.

1598
01:35:00,375 --> 01:35:02,667
[Coughing]

1599
01:35:20,375 --> 01:35:21,542
Where is he?

1600
01:35:21,625 --> 01:35:23,041
Where's cantrell?

1601
01:35:23,125 --> 01:35:25,250
Gone.

1602
01:35:26,375 --> 01:35:27,208
Where is he?

1603
01:35:27,542 --> 01:35:30,458
I swear!
He ran downstairs
and out back

1604
01:35:30,542 --> 01:35:33,250
after the explosion.

1605
01:35:33,333 --> 01:35:35,250
Out.

1606
01:35:39,542 --> 01:35:41,250
Get out!

1607
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:03,875
[Cheering]

1608
01:36:45,458 --> 01:36:49,083
We didn't have
any choice.

1609
01:36:50,959 --> 01:36:52,834
Cantrell?

1610
01:36:54,959 --> 01:36:56,875
Got away.

1611
01:36:58,959 --> 01:37:02,834
Why don't I feel
like we won?

1612
01:37:04,875 --> 01:37:06,792
Maybe because
we are tainted.

1613
01:37:06,875 --> 01:37:08,458
That's what
cantrell said.

1614
01:37:08,542 --> 01:37:10,792
What?

1615
01:37:12,625 --> 01:37:14,291
Nothing.

1616
01:37:17,583 --> 01:37:19,542
George?

1617
01:37:22,041 --> 01:37:24,333
Was it worth it?

1618
01:37:24,417 --> 01:37:27,333
I hope so.

1619
01:37:50,166 --> 01:37:53,041
Congratulations,
Mr. Mayor.
