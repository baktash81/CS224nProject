1
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,676
(woman) Garbage.

2
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,556
All I've been thinking about all week
is garbage. I can't stop thinking about it.

3
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,035
(man)
What kind of thoughts about garbage?

4
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:09,030
I just... I've gotten real concerned over
what's gonna happen with all the garbage.

5
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,311
I mean, we've got so much of it.

6
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,513
You know? I mean, we have to run out
of places to put this stuff eventually.

7
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:23,599
The last time... I started feelin' this way
is when that barge was stranded

8
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,872
and, you know, it was goin' around
the island and nobody would claim it.

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,276
- Do you remember that?
- Yes, I remember.

10
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,995
Do you have any idea
what may have triggered this concern?

11
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,270
Yeah. Yeah.

12
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,229
You see, the other night
John was taking out the garbage,

13
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,193
and he kept spilling things
out of the container,

14
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,993
and that made me...

15
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,478
I started imagining, like,
a garbage can that produces garbage.

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,834
And it doesn't stop, it keeps producing
garbage. And it keeps overflowing.

17
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,351
And, you know, what would you do
to try to stop something like that?

18
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,074
- Ann, do you see any pattern here?
- What do you mean?

19
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,510
Well, last week we were talking about

20
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,632
your obsession with
the families of airline fatalities.

21
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,435
Now we're talking about your
concern over the garbage problem.

22
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,516
Yeah... So?

23
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,992
Well, if you think about it, I think
you'll see the object of your obsession

24
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,636
is invariably something negative
which you have no control over.

25
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,955
Yeah, but how many people do you think

26
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,311
run around obsessing over
how great and how happy things are?

27
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,116
You know, I mean, maybe they do,
but I don't think they're in therapy.

28
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,757
Anyway... bein' happy isn't all that great.

29
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,708
I mean, the last time
I was really happy, I got so fat.

30
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,474
I must've put on 25 pounds.

31
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,559
I thought John was gonna have a stroke.

32
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,912
- So, what are you worried about?
- What am I looking at here?

33
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,634
- Is this a mistake?
- Depends on your point of view.

34
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,719
I don't think so. In fact,
I'm gonna tell you a little secret.

35
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,438
As soon as you get a ring on your finger,
you start getting spectacular attention

36
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,949
- from the opposite gender.
- That's bullshit!

37
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,674
Seriously. I wish I had
Super Bowl seats for every time

38
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,759
some filly had come up and talked to me
without the slightest provocation.

39
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,270
- It's just marvellous.
- That happened before you got married.

40
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,039
No, no, no.
It never happened before I got married.

41
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,550
If I'd known, I'd have bought a ring
when I was 18 and saved myself...

42
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,159
(laughs) Yeah, right!

43
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,271
...a lot of time and money.

44
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,356
No, I wish somebody'd clued me in.

45
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,675
I'm tellin' you.

46
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,076
It's too weird.
Oh, shit, I gotta be someplace.

47
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,760
- So, racquetball Thursday, right?
- How about 7.30?

48
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,633
- Yeah, fine. See you later. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

49
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,830
- (woman) Yes, sir?
- Janet.

50
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,795
Reschedule Kirkland for, uh, Friday, 1.30.

51
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,956
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

52
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,837
(therapist) Are you still
keeping these thoughts from John?

53
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,871
(Ann) Yeah.

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,675
Are you afraid of his finding you silly
at thinking these things?

55
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,950
No, it's not that. It's just...

56
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,548
- I'm really angry at him right now.
- Why?

57
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:38,152
He invited this college friend of his to
stay at our house and didn't even ask me.

58
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,159
I'm gonna say yes, of course, but...

59
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,716
you know, it just would've
been nice to have been asked.

60
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,195
What upsets you about that?

61
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,919
I guess it makes me angry
because I can't justify bein' angry.

62
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,759
It's his house. He pays the mortgage.

63
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,078
Yes, but he asked you to quit your job,
and you do have housework.

64
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,509
Yeah. I have housework. That's true.

65
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,236
This unexpected guest notwithstanding,
how are things with John?

66
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,277
Oh, they're fine.

67
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,632
Ex cept for I'm going through this thing
where I don't want him to touch me, but...

68
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,957
When did you begin having this feeling?

69
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,640
Well... last week.

70
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:25,278
I don't know, I just... I got this
really strange feelin', and... ugh...

71
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,674
just didn't want him to touch me.

72
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,079
Prior to this feeling, were you
comfortable with contact with John?

73
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,555
Oh, yeah. Sure. Yeah.

74
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,438
Ex cept for... well...

75
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,675
I've never really been that much into sex.

76
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,518
I mean, I like it and everything, but...

77
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,917
You know, I just don't think
it's such a big deal, and...

78
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,839
I wouldn't miss it, you know, kinda thing.

79
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,911
But lately I've just... been kinda curious
about how things have slacked off.

80
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,116
Perhaps he senses
your hesitance at being touched.

81
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,713
But that's the weird thing,
because he started not touching me

82
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,308
before I started feelin' like that.

83
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,236
Ah.

84
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,351
I mean, I'm sure he probably wishes
that I would initiate things once in a while,

85
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:30,270
and I would, ex cept for
it just never occurs to me, and...

86
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,074
well, the few times
I have felt like it I was by myself.

87
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,915
Did you do anything?

88
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,515
What do you mean?

89
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,517
Did you masturbate?

90
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,558
Oh!

91
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,515
Oh. Oh.

92
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,316
God, no.

93
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,430
No. Mm-mm.

94
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,678
I take it from your response
that you never masturbate.

95
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,354
Well... I tried once.

96
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,835
It just seems so stupid!

97
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,151
I don't know! It just seemed like
a dumb thing to do, and...

98
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,912
God, and then I started worrying that my
dead grandfather was watching me, and...

99
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,632
(sighs)

100
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,591
It seemed so stupid, especially when you
don't know what to do with the garbage.

101
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,632
Oh, so it was recently
when you tried this?

102
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,391
Oh, well, it was kind of recently,
but not... real recently.

103
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,035
I am just not up to
havin' a guest in the house.

104
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,991
I gotta go. I gotta go to the office.
I gotta get back to the office.

105
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,276
I only get one today? Gee, how ex citing.

106
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,276
I already skipped one meeting.
I gotta get back.

107
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,712
Look, John, if you wanna leave, leave.

108
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,789
My life doesn't revolve around these
little get-togethers. Don't flatter yourself.

109
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:27,350
Don't feel like you gotta treat me with
kid gloves. Tell me how you really feel.

110
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:34,157
Listen, I got a friend comin' into town,
an old friend I haven't seen in years.

111
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,591
From what I can tell,
I think he's a little lost.

112
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,472
I think I may have
to spend a little time with him.

113
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,558
Mm-hm.
Meaning we'll have to cool it for a while?

114
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,636
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

115
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,428
I wish you'd quit
that bartending job of yours.

116
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,232
Why?

117
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,113
I hate the thought
of all those guys hittin' on you.

118
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,516
(laughs) I can handle it.

119
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,312
I'm sure.

120
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,878
Besides, the money is good,
and some of the guys are cute.

121
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,554
And you are in no position to be jealous.

122
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,590
Who said I was jealous?

123
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,676
I did.

124
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,675
You know, I'd like to do it
at your house sometime.

125
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,158
I must admit, the idea of doin' it in my
sister's bed gives me a perverse thrill.

126
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,877
I wish I could just come right out
and tell everyone Ann's a lousy lay.

127
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,152
The beautiful, the popular
Ann Bishop Millaney.

128
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,316
- Could be risky.
- How about I just start a rumour, then?

129
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,831
- No, no, I mean doin' it at my house.
- Afraid of gettin' caught?

130
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,313
Yeah!

131
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,796
You should be.

132
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,875
- Can I meet this friend of yours?
- Who, Graham?

133
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,833
I gotta tell you, we were very close
many years ago, but I...

134
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,234
I think we're very different now.

135
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,239
(doorbell)

136
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,959
- Yes?
- Ann? Uh, my name is Graham Dalton.

137
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,869
- Oh! Yeah, sure.
- May I use your bathroom?

138
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,195
Uh-huh. Come on in.

139
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,396
- Where is it?
- Oh, back there to the left. I'm sorry.

140
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,750
Do you like strawberries?
I brought you some.

141
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,836
Thank you. That's real sweet.

142
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,396
Hi. Um, John Millaney, please.
This is his wife.

143
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,028
That's all right. Thank you.

144
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,232
Well.

145
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,471
- That was quick.
- False alarm.

146
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,556
Have a seat.

147
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,320
I'm sorry, we don't let people
smoke in the house.

148
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,752
- But if you'd like to, we could go outside.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No, no. I...

149
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,916
I can wait. I'm...

150
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,634
- Do you have any other things?
- Yes.

151
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,194
Oh, you mean to bring in? No.
I do have some other things, but I don't...

152
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,675
This is all I need to stay here.

153
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,914
Have you ever been on television?

154
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,829
Television? No, no.

155
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,359
Why?

156
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,796
I was just curious.

157
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,789
Graham. That's an unusual name.

158
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,878
Yeah. Yeah, l, uh... I guess it is.

159
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,754
My mother is a complete Anglophile.

160
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,598
Anything British
makes her drool like a baby.

161
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,190
So she, you know, I think she heard
the name in a movie or something.

162
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,437
She's a prisoner of public television now.

163
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,393
How do you like being married?

164
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,429
I like it just fine.

165
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,358
What about it do you like? I...

166
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,837
- I don't mean to be critical. I'm curious.
- No, no, no, no. That's OK. Uh...

167
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,951
Well... you know the cliche
about the security of it?

168
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,036
Well, that's true.

169
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,634
And, um, we own this house.

170
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,598
It's a nice house. And...

171
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,356
John was just made junior partner,
and I really like that.

172
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,036
You know, I like the fact that he's just not,
you know, freelance or whatever.

173
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,798
Yes.

174
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,036
So, how long has it been
since you've seen John?

175
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,559
- Nine years.
- Nine years?

176
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,800
Yeah. I was surprised he invited me
to stay here until I found a place.

177
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,550
- Didn't you know him very well?
- Oh, no, I knew him very well.

178
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,240
John and I...

179
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,555
were very much alike.

180
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,669
Really?

181
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,830
That's kinda hard to believe.
I mean, you just seem so different now.

182
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,234
Yeah. Well, I would imagine
we are pretty different now.

183
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,952
- I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
- OK.

184
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,155
Graham. I gotta tell you, I almost
called the cops when I saw you today.

185
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:34,070
I thought to myself
"This couldn't possibly be the same guy

186
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,193
that once held private services in
the back of the chapel on a weekly basis".

187
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,235
- You did that?
- Everybody has a past. That's mine, so...

188
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,476
So, what's with the get-up?

189
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,914
- Somebody die, or...?
- (Ann) John!

190
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,600
- I'm sorry. Did...? I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

191
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,676
Nobody died.

192
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,031
- So...
- I mean...

193
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,073
what do you think the Greeks'd
think of this rather sombre attire?

194
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,356
I don't know.

195
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,636
- Dinner was very good.
- Yeah, it wasn't bad, honey.

196
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:14,357
Usually Ann achieves a kinda critical
mass with the salt, but, uh, tonight was...

197
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,314
I always tell her, you can always
add more, but you can't take it away.

198
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,000
Yeah, you say that, don't you?

199
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,428
- So, do you have family here?
- Mm.

200
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,915
Mother, father, my sister.

201
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,353
- Sister older or younger?
- Younger.

202
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,716
Are you close?

203
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,878
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm prying again. I'm sorry.

204
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,195
Were you prying before?

205
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,550
I was grilling Ann about your marriage.

206
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,911
- How'd it go?
- Well, I... Very well. Uh...

207
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,000
So, I was asking about your sister.

208
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,271
Yeah. Well...

209
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,238
We get along all right, it's just that, uh...

210
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,115
Well, I think she's an extrovert.

211
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,835
I just think she's loud.
She probably wouldn't agree.

212
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,799
No, I mean, definitely wouldn't agree.

213
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,354
So, listen, are you gonna
see Elizabeth while you're here?

214
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,118
Uh... I don't know.

215
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,599
- Who's Elizabeth?
- A girl Graham dated in school.

216
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,188
Well after the chapel episodes.

217
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,436
She still lives here,
to the best of my knowledge.

218
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,954
So Graham and I
were talking about apartments,

219
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,392
and I told him that they've got lovely
little apartments in the Garden District.

220
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,355
- And they got nice garage apartments...
- There's critical crime in that district.

221
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,278
- Oh, John, come on, that is not true.
- No. There are...

222
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,712
I don't know what kind of place you're
lookin' for. There's plenty of apartments...

223
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,559
- ...in any one place.
- I'm sorry?

224
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:05,195
No, I just... Right now I have one key,
you know, everything I own is in the car.

225
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,357
I like that.
If I get an apartment, that's two keys.

226
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,349
If I get a job, you know, I might have
to open or close. That's more keys.

227
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,600
I buy some stuff, I'm afraid it's gonna
get ripped off, and I get more keys.

228
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,191
- I just like having the one key. It's clean.
- You don't have to worry about losin' 'em.

229
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,471
Get rid of the car when you get
the apartment. Still one key.

230
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,549
I like having the car. You know?
The car's important. You gotta be mobile.

231
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,478
In case you have
to leave someplace in a hurry?

232
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,194
Yeah, or go someplace in a hurry.

233
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,915
Ex cuse me.

234
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,477
- Do you want some help?
- No, no, really, I'm fine.

235
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,875
There's not that much to do.

236
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,038
Graham, do you pay taxes?

237
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,190
Yeah, I pay taxes.
Yeah, I pay taxes. What do you mean?

238
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,596
You don't pay taxes, you're a liar.
I'm not a liar.

239
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,916
Liars are the second-lowest form
of human being on the planet.

240
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,554
- (Ann) What's the first?
- Lawyers.

241
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,076
Oh. That's you, honey.

242
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,153
Annie, why don't you go with Graham
to hunt for apartments?

243
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,430
Show him how the city's changed.

244
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,790
- Would you mind, Graham?
- No, I'd love that.

245
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,629
- I'd like that, too. Let's do that.
- All right. How about tomorrow?

246
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,796
- That'd be great.
- Good.

247
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,872
One key, huh?

248
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,268
(John) Great idea.

249
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,356
(phone rings)

250
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,469
- Yeah.
- Cynthia, John.

251
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,273
Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.

252
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,675
You are scum.

253
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,756
I'll be there.

254
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,277
As you can see,
there's plenty of room for two.

255
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,030
No, it'll just be me.

256
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,594
- Are you a student?
- No.

257
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,478
You can hang
a shower curtain in the bath.

258
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,398
Make sure you put somethin'
in the tub so you won't fall.

259
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,356
You said about 350?

260
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,799
Yeah. And, uh, plus
the first and the last months' rent.

261
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,354
- All right. Will you lease month to month?
- Not for 350.

262
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,956
How about 400?

263
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,749
I could live with that. I could live with that.

264
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,598
- OK. It's a deal.
- All right.

265
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,676
- Ready?
- Yeah.

266
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,956
- John?
- In here.

267
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,115
Well, ain't you a picture?

268
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,919
Well, do you like it?

269
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,157
It's lovely. Is it for me?

270
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,716
Yeah, it's for you.

271
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,349
Is that for me?

272
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,596
Yeah, that's for you.

273
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,236
You're amazing, dear.

274
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,233
(Ann) Can I tell you something personal?

275
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,434
It's up to you.
Can I tell you something personal?

276
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,516
Yeah. Yeah.

277
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,675
Well, you gotta go first.

278
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,558
OK.

279
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,109
I think that, um...

280
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,595
I think that sex is overrated.

281
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,030
I think that people place
far too much importance on it.

282
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,119
And I think that stuff about women
wantin' it just as bad as men is crap.

283
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:40,394
I think they want it, I just don't think they
want it for the reason men think they do.

284
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,554
I'm getting confused.

285
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,910
- Do you understand what I'm...?
- Yeah.

286
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,600
Yeah. Yeah.

287
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,793
Yeah, I remember reading somewhere

288
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:59,199
that men learn to love
the person that they're attracted to,

289
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:05,434
and that women become more and more
attracted to the person that they love.

290
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,398
God, that's... that's beautiful.

291
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,955
That's really beautiful. I like that.

292
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,036
Oh, I'm just quoting.

293
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,874
So, are you gonna
tell me something personal?

294
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,719
- Do you want me to?
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.

295
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,718
I don't want it to be
something gross, about some scar.

296
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,071
I want it to be something
really personal, about yourself.

297
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,236
All right. OK.

298
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,399
- I'm impotent.
- You're what?

299
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,756
- lmpotent.
- (clears throat) You are?

300
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,277
Yeah. I mean, like, well, I can't...

301
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:49,436
I can't get an erection...
in the presence of another person.

302
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,598
So, for all practical purposes,
I'm impotent.

303
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,396
Does that bother you?

304
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,558
No.

305
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,833
Does it make you feel self-conscious?

306
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,636
Not usually.

307
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,871
No. Uh...

308
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,150
Yeah, I'm self-conscious.

309
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,556
Not in the same way
that you are, though.

310
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,270
- Me? Me? You think I'm self-conscious?
- Well...

311
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,230
I been watching you. I watch you eat,
you know, I watch you speak,

312
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,798
watch you move, and I see somebody

313
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:50,311
who is extremely aware
of people looking at you.

314
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,354
- My therapist...
- You're in therapy?

315
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,516
Aren't you?

316
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,594
No. I... No, I'm not.

317
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,320
I was a miserable failure in therapy.

318
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,028
- So you don't believe in therapy?
- No, I believe in it for some people.

319
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,838
I don't know, it was,
you know, silly for me.

320
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,790
I was confused going in.

321
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,829
So I just formed my own theory

322
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,633
that you should never take advice

323
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,957
from someone
that doesn't know you intimately.

324
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,156
Well, I know my therapist intimately.

325
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,036
- You've had sex with your therapist?
- No!

326
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,153
- No. No.
- Oh, no, I'm sorry. That's what I meant.

327
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,953
Somebody you've had sex with.

328
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,638
Oh.

329
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,112
I'm... I don't understand.

330
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,869
I mean, how would you know?

331
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,755
- I mean, you know. How...?
- Oh, no. I wasn't always impotent.

332
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,914
Oh. Oh, OK.

333
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:14,036
So, let me see. You said, um...

334
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,990
you said that I should never take advice

335
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,635
from someone that
I haven't had sex with, right?

336
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,632
- Basically.
- Right.

337
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,274
And, uh, we haven't had sex.

338
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,276
- Right?
- No.

339
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,511
So I guess from your own advice,
I shouldn't take your advice.

340
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,800
- I wouldn't.
- You wouldn't? OK.

341
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,436
(Ann) All right.

342
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,555
- Drive safely.
- Yeah, right.

343
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,591
- (therapist) How was your weekend?
- (Ann) It was OK.

344
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,911
- Did you confront John about the visitor?
- The visitor?

345
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,077
The friend of John's
that was staying at your house.

346
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,589
- Graham.
- Graham.

347
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,952
Yeah. I mean... no.

348
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,038
That actually
turned out to be interesting.

349
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,956
You know, I was expecting him
to be just like John.

350
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,516
You know, cos they went
to school together and everything.

351
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:47,158
You know, talking about getting drunk
together and secret handshakes and...

352
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,075
He turned out to be
really this... character.

353
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,033
He's kind of arty.

354
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,151
But OK.

355
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,669
Is he still at your house?

356
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,997
No. No. No. He's gone.

357
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,594
So where's he from?

358
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,999
I don't know. He, uh, used to live
in New York and Philadelphia.

359
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,075
I think he just kinda travels around.

360
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,954
Must be nice.
So, what's he like? Is he like John?

361
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,550
No. I don't think John likes him any more.

362
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,794
Says he thinks he's gotten kinda strange.

363
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,956
Is he? Strange, I mean?

364
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,992
No. I mean, if I saw him
on the street I might think so,

365
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,351
but after talkin' to him,
I'd just say he's kinda unusual.

366
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,029
Mm-hm. So, what's he look like?

367
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,071
Why?

368
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,397
- I just wanna know, is all.
- Why, so you can go after him?

369
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,592
Jesus, Ann, get a life.
I just asked what he looked like.

370
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,519
Besides, even if I decide
to fuck his brains out,

371
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,915
what business is that of yours?

372
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,429
- Why do you have to say that?
- Say what?

373
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,074
You know what.
You say it just to irritate me.

374
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,714
I say it because it's descriptive.

375
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,469
He doesn't strike me as a person
who would go in for that kinda thing.

376
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,036
- Ann, you always underestimate me.
- I wonder why.

377
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:29,711
I think you're afraid to put us in the same
room. You're afraid he'd be drawn to me.

378
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,957
Really, Cynthia,
I don't think he's your type.

379
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,238
My type?
How would you know what my type is?

380
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,828
Oh, I have a pretty good idea.

381
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,670
Ann, you don't have a clue.

382
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,238
Look, I don't even know
why we're discussin' this.

383
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,397
I mean, I'll just go over
and call him myself.

384
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,033
He doesn't have a phone.

385
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,594
Well, I'll call him when he does.

386
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,756
He won't.

387
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,871
What are you talkin' about?

388
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,151
He doesn't like to talk on the phone.
He's not getting a phone.

389
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,236
Oh, please.

390
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,068
OK, so give me the Zen master's address.
I'll think of a reason to stop by.

391
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,514
Please, just let me talk to him first.

392
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,792
Why? Just gimme the address.
You won't even have to be involved.

393
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,792
I don't feel right just giving you the
address so you can go over there and...

394
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,117
- And what?
- Do whatever it is you do.

395
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,073
"Do whatever it is you do"?
Listen to the way you talk.

396
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,398
- I talk fine.
- Thank you, I was still smoking that.

397
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,390
What'd you lose?

398
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,478
That goddamn pearl earring.

399
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,428
It cost me a fucking fortune.

400
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,676
I must've left it somewhere.

401
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,277
So, what are you
gettin' Momma for her birthday?

402
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,789
I don't know.
I'll get her a card or somethin'.

403
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:12,151
- A card for her 50th birthday?
- Yeah, what's wrong with that?

404
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,955
Well, the woman gave birth to you.
I think you might be givin' her...

405
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,071
Will you stop? Jesus.

406
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,590
- I just thought that, you know, maybe...
- OK, Ann. OK.

407
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,390
How about this?

408
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,911
You get her something nice,
and I'll pay for half.

409
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,600
- All right?
- Fine. Fine.

410
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,399
Fine. OK. Now, if you'll pardon me,
I have to go to work.

411
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,078
(Graham) What is the most unusual
location you've ever masturbated in?

412
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,398
Well...

413
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,079
l, um...

414
00:32:54,200 --> 00:33:00,150
One time I was flying from
Los Angeles to, um, to New York.

415
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,556
And I was... You know,
it was a really crowded flight and I was...

416
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,519
I was sitting in the middle.
I didn't get a window, I didn't get an aisle.

417
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,916
It was really funny,
and I was... I was just bored.

418
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:19,238
My magazines were just boring.
I think I had, like, a woman's magazine.

419
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,990
And they touch on a lot of sexual issues
and stuff. And I was thinking to myself

420
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:30,195
"God, that's what I need. I need a little...
something to take my mind off this trip."

421
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:36,157
So, I was just, you know,
just thinking away, and then I just...

422
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,712
I just did it on the plane.
Just between these two people.

423
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,956
- (knocking at door)
- Nobody knew.

424
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:49,793
(Graham) How were you able
to not betray what was going on

425
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,070
to the people around you?

426
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,796
Well, you know,
I have really strong muscles.

427
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,916
It's open!

428
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,358
- Hi!
- Hello, Ann.

429
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,914
- I hope I'm not botherin' you.
- No, no.

430
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:11,750
- I would've phoned. You busy?
- No, no. I can finish later.

431
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,668
I just wanted to see what
the apartment looked like with furniture.

432
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,917
Yeah, well, I'm afraid
there's not much to see.

433
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,953
I'm sort of cultivating
this minimalist vibe.

434
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,749
- You could use a bookshelf.
- Yeah? Yeah, you think so?

435
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,516
They're... you know,
they're all library books.

436
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,236
- What are these?
- Uh, those are videotapes.

437
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,193
I can see that. Of what?

438
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,479
It's a personal project
I've been workin' on.

439
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,160
What kind of personal project?

440
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,678
- What?
- What kind of personal project?

441
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,955
Uh, a personal project
like anyone else's personal project.

442
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,595
Mine's just a little more...
personal, I guess.

443
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,595
Who's Donna?

444
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,110
- What?
- Donna. It says "Donna" here on the tape.

445
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,994
Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.

446
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,395
Oh, you went out with her?

447
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,709
No, not really.

448
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,549
Why do these tapes
all have women's names on 'em?

449
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,078
Well, I enjoy interviewing
women more than men.

450
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,669
- It's iced tea.
- Thanks.

451
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,554
- I'm sorry, do you want some lemon?
- No, this is perfect.

452
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,355
So, all of these are... are interviews, huh?

453
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,040
- Uh, yes.
- Can we watch one?

454
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,150
No, I'd... No.

455
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,236
Why not?

456
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,918
Well, I promised each of the subjects

457
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,555
that no one would
see the videotapes ex cept for me.

458
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,514
What are the interviews about?

459
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,638
The interviews are about sex.

460
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,238
Sex?

461
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,312
What about sex?

462
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,318
Uh, everything about sex.

463
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,232
Like what?

464
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,313
What they've done, what they do,

465
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:38,995
what they want to do but are afraid to ask
for, what they wouldn't do even if asked.

466
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,760
Anything I can think of. Oh, your ice.

467
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,150
- You just ask them questions?
- Yes.

468
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,350
And they answer 'em?

469
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,948
Yeah. Uh...

470
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,389
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.

471
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:07,469
- To you?
- No, uh... for the camera.

472
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,595
- Graham, this is just so...
- I'm sorry this came up.

473
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,032
No, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry this came up, and...

474
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,709
- I'm... I'm gonna go.
- Here, I'll take it.

475
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,717
- OK. Yeah. All right.
- Bye.

476
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,911
He doesn't want you to come over.

477
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,554
(Cynthia) What do you mean?
Did you tell him about me?

478
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,989
- No, I didn't.
- Why not?

479
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,396
- Look, Cynthia, I didn't have time.
- Well, why?

480
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,829
John's right. He's strange and you
don't wanna get involved with him.

481
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,712
What happened over there?

482
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,990
- Did he make a pass at you?
- No.

483
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:57,272
Well, what's this "strange" bullshit
all of a sudden? Is he drownin' puppies?

484
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,516
It's nothin' like that, OK?

485
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:04,031
- Well, what? Is he dangerous?
- No. Not physically.

486
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,790
- Well, what, then?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

487
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,150
- Then why did you call me?
- I don't know.

488
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,236
(phone rings)

489
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,509
- Hello?
- Cynthia, John.

490
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,791
Not today. I've got other plans.

491
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,274
Oh. Well, when, then?

492
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,029
How about inviting me over to dinner?

493
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,516
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

494
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,797
- (knocking)
- It's open.

495
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,236
- Hi.
- Hello.

496
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,359
- Can I help you?
- I'm Cynthia Bishop.

497
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,956
- Do I know you? I don't...
- I'm Ann Millaney's sister.

498
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,358
The extrovert.

499
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,870
She must have been in a good mood.
She usually calls me loud.

500
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,434
Yeah, she called you that, too.

501
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,918
So, uh, what are you doin' here?

502
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,029
- You want me to leave?
- No, I just wanna know why you're here.

503
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,996
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister.
Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.

504
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,396
No, I think it's probably better
if I don't characterise that conversation

505
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,590
that I didn't hear.

506
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:44,312
I don't have any idea, really, what you
or Ann said about me or anything else.

507
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,993
- Do you want some iced tea?
- Sure.

508
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,709
I don't have any lemons.

509
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:59,393
The last time I saw Ann she left here
very confused, I'd say, and upset.

510
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,317
She still is.

511
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:07,676
So, are you here to make me feel bad
for makin' her feel bad?

512
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,278
No.

513
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,678
- She didn't tell you why she was upset?
- No.

514
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,998
Thanks.

515
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:35,469
So, I don't understand
what made you wanna come here.

516
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:40,196
I can't imagine Ann painted
a very flattering portrait of me.

517
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,598
Yeah, well, see, um, I don't really
listen to Ann when it comes to men.

518
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,679
I mean, look at John, for Christ's sake.

519
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,439
But then, you went to school
with him, didn't you?

520
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,869
You're probably friends or somethin'.

521
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,558
No.

522
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,955
No, I think John is a liar.

523
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,276
I think you're right.

524
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,829
So come on, I came all the way over here
to find out what got Ann so spooked.

525
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,992
Why don't you tell me what happened?

526
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:20,956
"Spooked"? The videotapes
are what got Ann so spooked.

527
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,198
Oh.

528
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,796
I think I get it.

529
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,434
Oh, yeah? What do you get?

530
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,996
If Ann got freaked out by these,
they must be somethin' sexual.

531
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,793
Are these tapes of you
havin' sex with these girls?

532
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,232
- No, not exactly.
- Either you are or you aren't. Which is it?

533
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:59,309
- Why don't you let me tape you?
- Doin' what?

534
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,431
- Talking.
- About what?

535
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,478
About sex. Your sexual history,
sexual preferences.

536
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,594
- What makes you think I'd discuss that?
- Nothing.

537
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,630
- And you just wanna ask me questions?
- I just wanna ask you questions.

538
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,716
- That's all?
- That's all.

539
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:33,709
Is this how you get off? Tapin' women
talkin' about their sexual experiences?

540
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,718
- Yes.
- Would anyone else see the tape?

541
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,799
Absolutely not. Nobody else
sees the tapes ex cept for me.

542
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,550
How long will it take?

543
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:49,517
Well, that depends on you.
One woman used up only three minutes.

544
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,788
And another used three two-hour tapes.

545
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,796
How do we start?

546
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,878
I turn on the camera and you start talking.

547
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,831
Do I sit or stand?

548
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,997
- What do you prefer?
- I'd prefer to sit.

549
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,716
Are you ready?

550
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,635
OK, I'm recording.

551
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,151
- So tell me your name.
- Cynthia... Patrice... Bishop.

552
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,874
- You can speak in a normal voice.
- OK.

553
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,752
So, describe for me
your first sexual experience.

554
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,435
Um...

555
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,358
First sexual experience
or first time I had intercourse?

556
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:51,029
- First sexual experience.
- (whispers) Sexual experience.

557
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,474
I was... uh... eight.

558
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,999
And, uh...
Is this the kinda thing that...? Yeah, OK.

559
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:14,516
I was eight years old, and, um,
Michael Green, who was also eight,

560
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,914
asked if he could watch me take a pee.

561
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,999
And I said he could
if I could watch him take one, too.

562
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,715
So we went to the woods
behind my house.

563
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,953
And I got this feeling he was chickenin'
out cos he kept sayin' "Ladies first!"

564
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:37,154
So I pulled down
my little panties and urinated,

565
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,238
and he ran away before I even finished.

566
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,878
Was it a topic of conversation
between you after that?

567
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,958
No! He kind of avoided me
for the rest of the summer,

568
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,640
and then his family moved away.

569
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,440
To Cleveland, actually.

570
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,516
What a shame.

571
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,840
When did you finally see a penis?

572
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,036
When I was 14.

573
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,954
So, what'd you think?

574
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,436
Was it what you expected it to be?

575
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,232
No. Not really. I...

576
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,593
I didn't... I sorta pictured it, um...

577
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,958
I didn't think it would have
veins or ridges or anything.

578
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:36,311
I just thought it would be smooth,
like a test tube.

579
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,473
It's weird, thinking about it now.

580
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:52,389
The... organ itself seemed like
a separate thing, a separate entity to me.

581
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:57,230
I mean, when he finally pulled it out
and I could look at it and touch it,

582
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,828
I forgot that there was a guy attached to it.

583
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,669
I remember literally being startled
when the guy spoke to me.

584
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,836
- What did he say?
- He said my hand felt good.

585
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,750
Then what happened?

586
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,716
And...

587
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:22,994
Then I started movin' my hand,
and then he stopped talkin'.

588
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,751
(buzzer)

589
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,871
- Yeah?
- John, Cynthia.

590
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,915
- How'd you get through?
- I told Janet I was Ann.

591
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,031
Ah. She bought it?

592
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,390
Well, obviously.

593
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:00,593
Look... I want to see you.

594
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,748
- Ah. When?
- Right now.

595
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,348
I don't know if I can do that.
I got a client waiting.

596
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,918
I've already rescheduled him once.
I'd have to do some heavy-duty juggling.

597
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,112
Then get those balls in the air
and get your butt over here.

598
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,196
(hangs up)

599
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,396
- Yes, sir?
- Janet.

600
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,517
Listen, I want you to reschedule Kirkland.
I know, I know.

601
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,473
See if he can come in Monday, any time.

602
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,034
Tell him, uh... Tell him, uh...

603
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,953
- Family crisis. Family crisis.
- OK.

604
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,036
- I'll slip out the back.
- Yes, sir.

605
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,116
All right. Bye.

606
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,717
Would you like me to take my skirt off?

607
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,956
(Graham) If you wish.

608
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,954
You're not wearing any underwear.

609
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,154
(Cynthia) Do you like the way I look?

610
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,276
(Graham) Yes.

611
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,675
Do you think I'm pretty?

612
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,078
Yes.

613
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,316
Prettier than Ann?

614
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,396
Different.

615
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,074
John and Ann don't have sex any more.

616
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,715
Is that what he tells you?

617
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:15,115
He doesn't have to tell me.

618
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,676
You're on fire today.

619
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,838
Yes.

620
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,956
You can go now.

621
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,036
(John chuckles)

622
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,709
What kind of questions?

623
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:57,515
(Cynthia) Questions... about... sex.

624
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:02,678
Well, what did he ask, exactly?

625
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,951
Well, I don't wanna tell you, exactly.

626
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,710
You let a total stranger record your sexual
life, but you won't tell your own sister?

627
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:17,118
- Apparently.
- Did he ask you to take your clothes off?

628
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,872
Did he ask me to take my clothes off?
No, he didn't.

629
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,956
- Did you take your clothes off?
- Yes.

630
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,310
- Cynthia!
- What?

631
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,476
- Why did you do that?
- Because I wanted to.

632
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,637
- But why did you want to?
- Because I wanted him to see me.

633
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:36,070
You're crazy. He could be
bouncin' it off some satellite.

634
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:40,796
- Some horny old men could be watchin'.
- Ann! He wouldn't do that.

635
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,913
- You don't know that for sure.
- Well, it's too late now, isn't it?

636
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,318
- Did he touch you?
- No.

637
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,514
- Did you touch him?
- No.

638
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,555
Did anybody touch anybody?

639
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,110
Well, yes.

640
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,668
Don't tell me.

641
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,190
Don't tell me. Don't tell me. You didn't.

642
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,470
- I did.
- You didn't.

643
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:18,115
- I did!
- Oh, my God. Cynthia!

644
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,474
You're in trouble.

645
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:27,798
Listen to you. You sound like Momma.
What are you talkin' about?

646
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,231
God, Cynthia.

647
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:34,989
- I couldn't do that in front of John.
- You couldn't do it, period.

648
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:38,430
- I mean, you don't even know him.
- I feel like I do.

649
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,154
You don't.
You can't trust him. He's perverted.

650
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,234
I don't understand why
this freaks you out so much.

651
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:48,148
You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't
bother me, why should it bother you?

652
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,711
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- OK, then, don't.

653
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,709
Are... are you an assassin?

654
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,035
- Ex cuse me?
- You're just an errand boy,

655
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,913
sent by the grocer to collect the bill.

656
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,675
It's my Brando. That's pretty good,
isn't it? Marlon Brando.

657
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,109
It's great. Pardon me.

658
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,995
OK. I was thinkin' we needed time apart.
Maybe you should be there for a while.

659
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:42,199
Hi. So, why don't you get
an answering machine?

660
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:45,073
- There's a phone here.
- It's busy.

661
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,994
Well, why don't you keep tryin'?

662
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,158
OK.

663
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,919
- Well, here it is.
- What is it?

664
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:59,077
- It's a sundress.
- Looks like a tablecloth.

665
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,309
- It does not.
- Why would she want a sundress?

666
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,159
She's got spots on her shoulders
and varicose veins.

667
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,831
- Well, missy thing, so will you someday.
- When I do, I won't wear sundresses.

668
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,359
(phone rings)

669
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,630
- God, Cynthia...
- Hold on.

670
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,031
- Bayou.
- Cynthia, John.

671
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,835
- Would you like to speak with your wife?
- What's she doin' there?

672
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:35,270
Showing me a present
she and I are buying your mother-in-law.

673
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:39,712
Oh. Great. So, when can I see you?

674
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:44,277
I don't know. I'm not sure I can
duplicate the intensity I had the other day.

675
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,595
Nothin' wrong with trying.

676
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,234
I don't think my sister would agree.

677
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,318
Do you want me to stop calling?

678
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,954
- Look, I'll call you. OK?
- Roger.

679
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:03,518
This is too much. I'm wearing red, you're
wearing red. That's quite a coincidence...

680
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,359
- Look, I'm married.
- Really?

681
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,471
Are you very married?

682
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,239
- Married enough.
- Oh. Oh.

683
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:15,194
- I see. Well, that shouldn't stop us...
- I'm just here to see my sister. OK?

684
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,596
Oh, really?
Who's your sister? Is she married?

685
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,880
So, um, what's my share of the dress?

686
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,560
- 32.50.
- It's a nice dress.

687
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,399
- Thanks. I thought so, too.
- Looks like a tablecloth.

688
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:32,991
Keep the change. And, Ann, don't worry
about the dress. I'm sure she'll like it.

689
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:38,150
Yeah. I think it'll...
Oh, you have to go? OK. Goodbye.

690
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,669
I'll see you later. I'll call you!

691
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,879
Bye.

692
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,118
John?

693
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,638
Mm?

694
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,556
- John?
- (grunts)

695
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:19,956
I called you last Monday at 3.30
and they said you weren't in.

696
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,754
Do you remember where you were?

697
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,399
On Monday?

698
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,034
Uh... Last Monday?

699
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,116
Oh, I had a late lunch.

700
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,594
So, who'd you have lunch with?

701
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,955
I ate by myself.

702
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,516
Come on.

703
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,433
- Is there somethin' wrong?
- Are you havin' an affair?

704
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,076
Jesus Christ!

705
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:09,595
I have a late lunch by myself
and now I'm fuckin' somebody?

706
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,950
- Well, are you?
- No, I'm not.

707
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:16,116
God, I'm offended
at the accusation. Come on.

708
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,989
If I'm right, I wanna know.

709
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:26,159
I don't want you to lie. I'd be upset,
but I'd be more upset if you lied to me.

710
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,830
Well, there's nothin' to know.

711
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,836
I can't tell you
how upset I'll be if you lie to me.

712
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,196
This is paranoia.

713
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:51,197
I mean... if anybody
should be paranoid, I should be.

714
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:57,477
Here, every time I try to touch you,
you act as if I'm dipped in shit.

715
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:02,676
I think there are a lot of women
out there that'd be glad to have

716
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:06,236
a young, straight male
makin' a pretty good living

717
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,517
beside 'em in bed with a... with a hard-on.

718
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,995
- My sister, for one.
- For God's sake, Ann.

719
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:16,476
- Is that who it is?
- Ann, I'm not fucking your sister.

720
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,637
I don't find her that attractive,
for one thing.

721
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,672
- Is that supposed to comfort me?
- No, I'm just saying.

722
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:27,635
I'm just saying I didn't get paranoid
when you didn't wanna make love to me.

723
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:33,073
I could have assumed that you didn't want
to because you were having an affair.

724
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,119
- I'm not.
- Well, I'm not either. Now, come on.

725
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:40,358
- Then why don't I believe you?
- Oh, look. This is ridiculous.

726
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,278
- Maybe when you have evidence...
- There's evidence?

727
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:47,951
That's not what I'm saying. I'm just
saying that we shouldn't not ever talk,

728
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:50,833
just don't give me
conjecture and intuition.

729
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,471
- Always a lawyer.
- Goddamn right.

730
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:57,479
I mean, can you imagine? "Your Honour,
I'm positive the man is guilty."

731
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,194
- "I can't place him at the scene..."
- All right.

732
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:04,029
- "But I have this strong feeling..."
- All right. You made your point. OK.

733
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,116
All right.

734
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,676
I'm sorry.

735
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,356
I'm sorry.

736
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,638
I'm just under a lot of pressure
with this... this Kirkland thing.

737
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:24,194
I mean, you know
it's my first big case as junior partner.

738
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,752
I work all day and I come home.

739
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,394
I look forward to seeing you.

740
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:38,716
It hurts that you'd accuse me like that.

741
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,956
I'm sorry.

742
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,910
What? Come on.

743
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:52,438
I've just got all this time
on my hands, and I just sit around

744
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:56,838
and start inventing these,
like, intricate scenarios.

745
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:03,155
And then I don't want to have wasted
all my time, so I wanna believe 'em.

746
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:09,555
- Isn't therapy helpin' at all?
- Oh, John, I don't know.

747
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,956
I just feel so stupid sittin'
talkin' about my little problems

748
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:16,117
when I know
those poor children are starving.

749
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,238
Well...

750
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:27,352
Quitting your therapy's not gonna...
not gonna feed the children in Ethiopia.

751
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,516
I know.

752
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,993
You never used to say the word "fucking".

753
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,198
Fuck.

754
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,998
It's so stupid, I have a hard time
believing you did it.

755
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:50,680
- What's so stupid about it?
- Well, you...

756
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:55,796
- You don't even know the guy.
- Well, you know him.

757
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,799
He's a friend of yours.
Do you think he can be trusted?

758
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,353
I don't know.

759
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:07,238
I don't know.
From what you've told me, I don't know.

760
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:10,557
I shoulda known when
he showed up dressed like

761
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,636
some undertaker for the art world.

762
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,830
I like the way he dresses.

763
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:27,112
What if this tape
gets into the wrong hands?

764
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:32,314
"The wrong hands"? John, we are not
talking about military secrets here.

765
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:37,798
They're just tapes he makes
so he can sit around and get off.

766
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,752
And he doesn't have sex
with any of them? They just talk?

767
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,113
They just sit around and talk.

768
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:52,317
I could almost understand it
if he had sex with them. I mean, almost.

769
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:57,279
Why doesn't he just buy some magazines
or some porno movies or somethin'?

770
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:01,919
Doesn't work. He has to know the people.
He has to be able to interact with them.

771
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,076
Interact?

772
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,156
Whatever that means.

773
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,755
Did you have to masturbate
in front of him?

774
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:13,509
I felt like it. Goddamn. You and Ann
make such a big deal out of this.

775
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,029
- You told Ann about this?
- She is my sister.

776
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,720
- I tell her almost everything.
- I wish you hadn't.

777
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:22,389
It's just something I'd prefer
she didn't have to know about.

778
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:25,990
- She's a grown-up. She can handle it.
- Ann...

779
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:30,153
- Ann is just very...
- Hung up.

780
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:35,076
- It just wasn't a smart thing to do.
- Oh, God!

781
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:41,434
Did you sign any sort of paper,
or did he have a contract with you

782
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:44,677
saying that he wouldn't
broadcast these things?

783
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,791
No, sir.

784
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,480
You realise you have no recourse legally?

785
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,079
(laughs)

786
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:55,159
It's not funny. It's not funny, Cynthia.

787
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,840
These tapes could show up anywhere.

788
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:00,315
They won't. I trust him.

789
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,120
You trust him? That's funny.

790
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:07,789
Yeah, I do.
A hell of a lot more than I trust you.

791
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:13,353
- What do you mean?
- Just what I said.

792
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,994
I'd trust him before I'd trust you.

793
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,198
- It hurts that you say that to me.
- You're fucking your wife's sister.

794
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,276
You're a liar. But at least I know that.

795
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:29,155
I know, I know. Second-lowest form
of human being. And the first.

796
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,478
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. You're lying to Ann, too.

797
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:39,357
Yeah, right, but I didn't take a vow in front
of God and everyone to be faithful to Ann.

798
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,833
Look, are we gonna do it or not?

799
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:54,276
Actually... no. I've changed my mind.
I shouldn't have called.

800
01:02:55,160 --> 01:03:00,792
Well, I'm here now.
I need to do somethin'.

801
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,309
Would you like
to help me straighten up?

802
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,751
Jesus!

803
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,838
Is there one chair
in this place that works?

804
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:13,111
Well, why don't you
go sit somewhere else?

805
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,552
Come on, John. You should be happy.

806
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:21,468
We've gone this far without Ann findin'
out. I'm makin' it real easy on you.

807
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,273
- Just walk out of here.
- Did he put you up to this?

808
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,356
- Who?
- Graham.

809
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:30,519
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus,
I don't need people to tell me what to do.

810
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,950
I've just been thinkin', that's all.
Now just... leave.

811
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:38,199
Maybe I don't wanna leave.

812
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,629
Maybe I wanna talk.

813
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:44,036
John, we don't have
anything to talk about.

814
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,356
Yeah, you're right.

815
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:52,998
Things are gettin' complicated.

816
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,395
No, they're gettin' real simple.

817
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,959
It's open!

818
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:36,878
Hello.

819
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,350
Want something to drink?

820
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:47,596
Yeah, thanks.

821
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:57,433
I'm sorry, I don't have any iced tea left.

822
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,396
Thank you.

823
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:12,999
John and Cynthia have been... fucking.

824
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:17,516
Yes, I know.

825
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,914
- You know?
- Yes.

826
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:25,388
How did you know?

827
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,589
She said it on her tape.

828
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:33,632
Thanks for telling me.
I really appreciate it.

829
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,910
Well, I... I haven't seen you.

830
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:40,914
And I don't think I would've told you
even if I had seen you.

831
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,996
Why not?

832
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:46,875
Because it's not really my place.

833
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,156
My life is shit.

834
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,596
It's just shit.

835
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,995
Nothing's what I thought it was.

836
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:14,516
John's a bastard.

837
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,676
Let's make a videotape.

838
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,756
No, I...

839
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:34,237
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Why not?

840
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:39,117
Because I don't think it's a choice that
you'd make in a normal frame of mind.

841
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:42,073
And what would you know
about a normal frame of mind?

842
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,070
That's a good question.

843
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:54,153
- So, what do you have to do to get ready?
- Uh...

844
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:00,674
Load a tape and turn on the camera.

845
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,037
Do it.

846
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:17,678
So, where do you get your money from,

847
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:21,998
for rent, and tapes, and stuff like that?

848
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,750
Underneath my mattress.

849
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:30,232
And what are you gonna do
when this money runs out?

850
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:32,316
It won't.

851
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:37,038
Are you comfortable there?

852
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:39,310
Yeah, I'm comfortable.

853
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,110
OK, I'm recording.

854
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:47,196
Tell me your name.

855
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,836
Ann Bishop Millaney.

856
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:26,998
Margaret. Hi, it's John. Fine.
Listen, have you seen Ann at all today?

857
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,076
This afternoon?

858
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,998
Uh... Well, no, I just...

859
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:35,590
She's home. Bye-bye.
Everything's fine. Thanks. Bye.

860
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,436
Thank God. You had me worried sick.

861
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:42,030
I come home,
the door is open, the car is gone.

862
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:46,236
I thought you'd been
abducted by some mad fucker.

863
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:51,595
- Are you all right?
- I want out of this marriage.

864
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:58,838
What?

865
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:05,395
I... want... out... of this marriage.

866
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:12,919
Why?

867
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,198
Why?

868
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,675
You're asking me why?

869
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:25,157
I'm married to you
and you want out of this marriage.

870
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,236
I think you could tell me that.

871
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:32,315
Fuck you. Fuck you.

872
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:39,436
All right.

873
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:45,869
- Can you tell me where you went?
- I drove around.

874
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,560
- Then I went over to Graham's.
- Graham's?

875
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:50,918
Graham.

876
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,436
Goddamn that son of a bitch!

877
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,632
The backstabbin' son of a...
Oh, Mr Honesty, huh?

878
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:03,716
Mr Apostle of Truth!

879
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:18,034
Well, I know you didn't fuck him.

880
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:31,116
Did you make one of
these goddamn videotapes?

881
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:39,595
Annie... answer me, goddammit.

882
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:42,075
Goddammit, answer me. Did you?

883
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,356
- Yes, I did.
- Ah!

884
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,792
God!

885
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,638
Don't you touch him!

886
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,870
OK. I'm gonna...

887
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:13,472
- (footsteps)
- What?

888
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:15,918
Hello?

889
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:21,515
John? What the hell are you doing here?
What are you doing?

890
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,915
(Graham) OK, I'm recording.

891
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,996
Tell me your name.

892
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:15,872
Ann... Bishop... Millaney.

893
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,555
So, what do you wanna talk about?

894
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:22,831
- What do you usually talk about?
- Sex.

895
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:25,394
OK. Let's talk about sex.

896
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:29,035
Do you have sex?

897
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,549
Not very often, no.

898
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:36,117
When you do, who usually initiates it?

899
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:38,196
He does.

900
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:42,270
Is the sex satisfying?

901
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:49,396
I don't know.

902
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,953
I don't know. I don't know what you mean.

903
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,189
Do you have orgasms?

904
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:59,550
I don't think so.

905
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:03,879
I mean, I guess, since I'm not sure,
that I've never had one.

906
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:28,879
Have you ever thought about having sex
with someone other than your husband?

907
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,468
Here we go.

908
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,276
Here we go.

909
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,475
- Why don't we stop?
- No.

910
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,636
I don't wanna stop.

911
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:58,436
Have you ever thought about having sex
with someone other than your husband?

912
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,710
I've thought about it.

913
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:03,829
- Did you act on it?
- No.

914
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,596
Why not?

915
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:13,998
Because that's how Cynthia thinks.
I hate it when I have feelings that she has.

916
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:21,754
It bothers me when I think about men,
because I know that's the way she thinks.

917
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:27,760
What other men have you thought about?

918
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:33,830
I thought about you.

919
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:38,599
- Have you thought about me?
- Yes.

920
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,471
What did you think?

921
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:51,517
I thought about what you would
look like having an orgasm.

922
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:02,996
I'd like to know
what I look like havin' an orgasm.

923
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:11,398
Can you do that?
Give a woman an orgasm?

924
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,074
Yes.

925
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:20,190
Could you do that for me?

926
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:26,876
- No.
- Why not?

927
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:30,157
Because I can't.

928
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:33,238
- Can't or won't?
- I can't because I won't.

929
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:47,591
- You said you weren't always impotent.
- No. Yeah, that's correct.

930
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:51,839
- So you have had sex.
- Yes.

931
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:59,031
So, what happened?
Was it so bad it turned you off, or...?

932
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:05,317
- No, that wasn't the problem.
- What was the problem?

933
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:08,354
I was the problem. I was a...

934
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:13,195
I was a pathological liar.

935
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,115
Or I am, I should say.

936
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:19,596
The lying is...

937
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,039
Lying is like alcoholism,
you're continually recovering.

938
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:28,076
So that's it?

939
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,716
You lied?

940
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:35,757
- That was part of it.
- So, what else happened?

941
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:41,236
Well, at that time, uh... I...

942
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:49,396
I used to express my feelings nonverbally,

943
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,470
and often scared people

944
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,550
that were close to me.

945
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,035
Are you still like that?

946
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:06,878
No.

947
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,958
No.

948
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,275
So you're never gonna make love again?

949
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:20,597
I don't... I haven't made any plans, so...

950
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,710
- If you were in love with me, would you?
- I'm not in love with you.

951
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:32,354
- But if you were?
- I can't answer that.

952
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,198
- Why not?
- I told you.

953
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:39,235
- But I don't understand.
- Ann, forget about the sex, you know? I...

954
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,957
I'm not the same person that I was...
even remotely, you know.

955
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,640
I'm different in so many ways.

956
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:52,595
It'd have a profound effect on the way that
I relate to other people, communicate.

957
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:57,475
This, for instance. The way she and I are
talking, it could never have been possible.

958
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,990
"She"? "The way she...
she and I are talking"?

959
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:04,758
- "She"? Who's "she"?
- I'm sorry, I was...

960
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:09,868
- That isn't what I was...
- She's Elizabeth? Is that who it is?

961
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,152
Is that the girl that John
talked about? Is that who it is?

962
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:26,354
- I guess. I... I'm sorry.
- So, you're still in contact with her?

963
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,391
- With Elizabeth?
- No. I'm...

964
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:33,752
What do you think Elizabeth
is gonna think about all these videotapes?

965
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:38,635
I can't imagine her
bein' too understanding.

966
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:44,831
But you're gonna tell her about them,
right, since you don't lie any more?

967
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:50,752
As I said, I don't know
what I'm gonna do, exactly.

968
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:55,317
I mean... perhaps I won't do anything.

969
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:59,115
So, you just came back here
so that you could think about it?

970
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:01,913
No, I moved back here for some...

971
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:08,673
A sense of closure, you know?

972
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:14,836
Resolution of some sort.

973
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:27,437
I wanted somebody who was very
important to me to understand that.

974
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:32,794
That's... That's pathetic.

975
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:39,278
I mean, you can't just...
Oh, my God, Graham.

976
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:43,516
You just can't walk up to her
and show her you've changed

977
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:46,074
like it's some gift or somethin'.

978
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,396
And look what you've changed into.

979
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:58,117
Nine years. Nine years.
And this is what you come up with.

980
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,037
Is this what you wanna be
the rest of your life?

981
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:08,310
Why are you doin' this?

982
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:13,679
Can you tell me that?
Why are you doin' this to yourself?

983
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,348
- Are you gonna answer me?
- Please, don't do that.

984
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:21,277
- Why not?
- Don't do that.

985
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:24,870
I wanna ask a few questions, like why
do you tape women talkin' about sex?

986
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,594
Why do you do that?
Can you tell me why?

987
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:31,070
Come on. I'm just gonna keep askin'.

988
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:33,873
I don't find turning the tables
very interesting.

989
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,912
Well, I do. Tell me why, Graham.

990
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,712
- Why?
- What?

991
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:42,628
What? What do you want me to tell you?
"Tell me why?" Why?

992
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:49,715
Ann, you don't even know who I am. You
don't have the slightest idea who I am.

993
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:56,589
Am I supposed to recount all the points
in my life leading up to this moment

994
01:22:56,720 --> 01:23:00,395
and just hope that it's coherent,
that it makes some sort of sense to you?

995
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:04,116
It doesn't make any sense to me.
You know, I was there.

996
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:07,228
I don't have the slightest idea who I am,

997
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:10,511
and I'm supposed
to be able to explain it to you?

998
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,719
And why? You tell me why.

999
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:16,595
Why do I have to explain myself to you?

1000
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:19,075
Because maybe I can help you.

1001
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:22,800
- Help me with what?
- Your problem.

1002
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:26,634
My problem? Do I have a problem?

1003
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:32,320
I look around me in this town and I see
John and Cynthia and you, and I...

1004
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:36,315
I feel comparatively healthy.

1005
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:42,796
You've got a problem.

1006
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,756
You're right.

1007
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,475
I've got a lot of problems.

1008
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,430
But they belong to me.

1009
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:13,476
You think they're yours, but they're not.

1010
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:17,673
Everybody that walks in that door
becomes part of your problem.

1011
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:20,997
Anybody that comes in contact with you.

1012
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:26,791
I didn't wanna be
part of your problem, but I am.

1013
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:30,030
I'm leavin' my husband,

1014
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:34,278
and maybe I would have anyway,
but the fact is that I'm doin' it now.

1015
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:39,274
And part of it's because of you.

1016
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:47,194
You've had an effect on my life.

1017
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,594
This isn't supposed to happen.

1018
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:03,676
I've spent nine years structuring my life
so that this didn't happen.

1019
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:54,479
You know, I never told you this,
cos I knew it'd crush you.

1020
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:58,916
But now...

1021
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:01,950
I fucked Elizabeth.

1022
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:06,039
Before you broke up.
Before you were havin' trouble, even.

1023
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:10,632
She's no saint.

1024
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:12,910
She was good in bed.

1025
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:15,955
She could keep a secret.

1026
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:20,274
That's about all I can say about her.

1027
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:18,755
- (John) I gotta make a call.
- (man) Yeah, sure.

1028
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:20,199
(ringing tone)

1029
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:23,717
- Kirkland's office.
- John Millaney for Brian Kirkland.

1030
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,910
- Just one moment, please.
- All right.

1031
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:29,237
Anyway, as I've always said,
work is critical.

1032
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:35,352
I can be happy without a marriage, but if
you take away my work, that's different.

1033
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:39,393
And if Ann can't handle that...

1034
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:44,630
- Well, that's her problem.
- (Janet) Mr Millaney?

1035
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:47,035
- Yeah.
- Mr DeForest would like to see you.

1036
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:49,470
All right. In a minute. I'm on with a client.

1037
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:53,513
- He said immediately.
- All right. Jesus.

1038
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:55,232
- (man) Mr Millaney?
- Yeah?

1039
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:59,399
Mr Kirkland asked me to inform you
he's obtained representation elsewhere,

1040
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:02,751
and that if you have a message
for Mr Kirkland to leave it with me.

1041
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,836
Thank you. Um...

1042
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:08,476
- No message.
- All right, Mr Millaney.

1043
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:10,591
Thank you.

1044
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:12,278
Fool!

1045
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:15,756
Hope he knows what he's doin'.

1046
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:17,673
- (Janet) Mr Millaney?
- Yeah?

1047
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:21,839
- Mr DeForest is waiting.
- All right. Tell him I'll be in in a minute.

1048
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:26,556
Jesus, the old man thinks that
the world revolves around a game of golf.

1049
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:29,956
I'll catch up to you at the courts.
I'd better go talk to DeForest.

1050
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,354
Sure.

1051
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,469
OK.

1052
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:42,158
Fuck.

1053
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:03,315
Oh, no, just one's fine, thanks.

1054
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:08,470
This is my favourite part.

1055
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:16,797
You know, I was thinking we should
name our first child Rusty.

1056
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:19,275
What do you think of that name?

1057
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:27,833
OK. You know, I spend a lot of money in
here. I should at least know your name.

1058
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:29,916
- Hey.
- Hey.

1059
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:34,310
I brought you this.
I knew it was your birthday.

1060
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:39,513
- Thanks.
- It's a nice plant. Looks like a tablecloth.

1061
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:47,073
Look, I can't stay. I gotta go.

1062
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:51,359
- Can I call you?
- Do you have my work number?

1063
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:52,595
No.

1064
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:56,595
Got a pen?

1065
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:02,993
OK, now, you're wearing blue,
I'm wearing blue.

1066
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:05,759
Is this some sort of weird coincidence?

1067
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:09,031
I don't think so.
I think it's something more.

1068
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:12,516
- Do you live here?
- No. I'm just passing through.

1069
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:19,917
Look, don't call between three and five,
cos I get real busy, OK?

1070
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:22,076
- OK.
- (barfly) OK.

1071
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:24,831
See ya.

1072
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:26,916
- Bye.
- (barfly) Bye.

1073
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:33,913
I like her.
She's a very nice girl. Very nice.

1074
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:47,396
- Hi.
- Hey.

1075
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,436
I think it's gonna rain.

1076
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:02,716
It is raining.

1077
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,318
Yeah.

1078
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:37,676
