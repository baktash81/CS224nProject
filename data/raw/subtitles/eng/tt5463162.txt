00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,460

and tear off
a piece of dry tissue...

561
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:27,520
and rub it around

and then go on,

Right?

568

So what you would do,

569

is you would get some soap,
you'd get some hot water...

570

and you would scrub
the fucking shit

out of your beard
for 10 straight minutes.

572
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,280
You could not
scrub it enough.

maybe clear out
that excess moisture.

582

Maybe treat yourself
to a blow and go,

a hair dryer.

Hello?

1162
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:52,450
I know you're in there.

1163
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,420
Must be hard
being the biggest guy in here.

1164
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:13,990
Lonely at the top, eh?

1165
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,000
They're moving us tomorrow.

1166
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,260
Maybe I can get you
out of here.

1167
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:24,610
And we can make
the whole world our bitch.

1168
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,230
We need a secret code.

Cool name! Superpowers?

1182

gonna be their Superman.

they understand pain.

1270
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:17,150

meant to bend.

1320
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:19,010

by the blatant sexism

1323
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,800
The point is, our group
will be forward thinking.

1324
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,150
Gender neutral.

1325
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:29,500

1652
01:26:41,690 --> 01:26:42,930
beat me within
an inch of my life.

1653
01:26:42,950 --> 01:26:44,300
He was torturing me!

1654
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:47,220
But all I told him was
everything he wanted to know.

1655
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:49,910
So, I'm here
to help us gear up.

1656
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,110

without me.

teabag him to death.

1669

1671

and fashion his bones
into holiday jewelry.

1672
01:27:14,110 --> 01:27:15,940
Then,
I'm gonna take his skin...

1673
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:19,030
and stretch it out
over a homemade mating drum.

1706
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:34,670
why not travel back to when
he was a baby, kill him then?

a little further,
