00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,500
<i>..and there is light.</i>

2
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:32,208
<i>There are men and women.</i>

3
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:39,042
<i>There's food.</i>

4
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,500
<i>There are restaurants.</i>

5
00:01:51,542 --> 00:01:53,333
<i>Disease.</i>

6
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:04,708
<i>There's work.</i>

7
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,458
<i>Traffic.</i>

8
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,333
<i>The days as we know them.</i>

9
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,333
<i>The world as we imagine the world.</i>

10
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,875
Hey.

11
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,417
Hey.

12
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:01,000
How would you feel
about heading home?

13
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,792
I've only just fallen asleep.

14
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,000
Well, you have, I haven't.

15
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:13,042
I have a tough time sleeping
with someone else in the bed.

16
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,833
Are you kicking me out?

17
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,042
I have to go to work soon anyway.

18
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,917
We dance and drink all night,
we go back to your place, you fuck me

19
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,208
and now you wake me up
and kick me out?

20
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,708
I can't sleep
with another person in the bed.

21
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:34,458
- That's funny.
- That's just the way it is.

22
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:40,792
[cry of seagulls]

23
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:45,250
I didn't know
you'd started smoking again.

24
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,250
What do you feel like doing?

25
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:02,417
Throwing stones.

26
00:04:05,042 --> 00:04:06,333
At what?

27
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,208
Seagulls.

28
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,833
Sweetheart.

29
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,833
- You'll find someone.
- Shut up and throw.

30
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:43,792
I suppose I should go back to work.

31
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,333
Come on.

32
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:52,583
Poor baby.

33
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,250
Lebanon?

34
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:49,667
Morocco.

35
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,708
Morocco.

36
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,833
Now that's funny.

37
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:05,333
- What's funny?
- Seeing you today.

38
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:06,750
Hilarious.

39
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:10,458
Come with me for a minute, will you?
They want us at the hospital.

40
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,500
Aren't you going to ask
why I haven't been to work?

41
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:18,375
- Well, you've been sick.
- Not sick, just unhappy.

42
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,042
Well, it's the same thing.

43
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,125
Unhappy on account of a man.

44
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:26,792
No kidding?

45
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,792
So what are we wanted for?

46
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,167
Er, to see a patient.

47
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,292
- Why?
- What's going on?

48
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,917
Well, we're just going to find out.

49
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,167
- You know he's really pissed off in there.
- Excuse me.

50
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,667
When can I take him back home?

51
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,875
Oh, well, we just need
to talk to him, so...

52
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:47,333
- He needs to explain it all again?
- Well...

53
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,875
Look. Look, listen.

54
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:52,000
He called me up, right,
and he told me he was coming home...

55
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:56,458
and then all of a sudden his voice breaks
and he bursts into tears.

56
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,792
Mm-hm.

57
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:01,792
And then he starts telling me
that he doesn't see any meaning to life.

58
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:05,083
I mean, he's not usually like that.
He's a truck driver.

59
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,167
OK.

60
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:09,708
And then he pulls over at the side
and says he's fine again.

61
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,917
- Except, he cannae smell any more.
- He can't smell any more?

62
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,208
Well, I told him to find a hospital

63
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,833
because, you know,
that isn't normal, is it?

64
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,875
Hello, er... Donald.

65
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,750
Stephen Montgomery here again.

66
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:42,625
<i>- Hi, I'm Susan.
- Hello, Stephen. Hello, Susan.</i>

67
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:46,542
- You can't smell any more?
<i>- </i> That's right, Susan.

68
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,458
<i>I can't smell any more.</i>

69
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,917
But is your mood back to normal?

70
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
<i>I've been sitting here for nearly
11 hours. My mood is not great.</i>

71
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:59,292
<i>But you don't feel any discomfort
other than a lack of smell?</i>

72
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,792
No, Susan.

73
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:04,875
<i>And has anybody else in your family
or at work had similar experiences?</i>

74
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,917
I haven't got a clue
cos I'm sitting here, aren't I?

75
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:16,208
- What do you want from me?
- I just want your opinion.

76
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,208
I'm an epidemiologist, Stephen.
So why am I talking to this guy?

77
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,167
Cos we've got seven more
just like him in Aberdeen.

78
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,875
Five in Dundee.

79
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:28,375
11 right here in Glasgow.
18 in Edinburgh.

80
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:31,000
There's over 100 reported cases
in England.

81
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:34,917
They've got them in France,
Belgium, Italy, Spain.

82
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:39,125
They've all appeared
in the last 24 hours.

83
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:44,792
How were they infected?

84
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,750
I'm not sure they are.

85
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:49,542
Meaning?

86
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:55,875
Well, all the early indications suggest
no connection between them at all.

87
00:08:55,917 --> 00:08:58,125
No contact. No pattern. Nothing.

88
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,375
[glass mutes voice]

89
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,125
Is my wife still out there?
Let me speak to my wife.

90
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:09,458
Please, let me speak to my wife.

91
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,250
[glass mutes voice]

92
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,625
STEPHEN:
Maybe it'll just go away.

93
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:27,417
- So we won't panic.
- Hm.

94
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:32,042
[chatter and laughter]

95
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,125
Michael, that's a table of 12
just sat down.

96
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,000
- Where are they, at the bar?
- Yeah.

97
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,250
Where's that lobster and haggis?
I need that right now.

98
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,125
- That's table five, mains.
- You're an arsehole.

99
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,833
- What's the matter with you?
- What?

100
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:52,083
- Those starters for table seven...
- That girl was such a sweetheart.

101
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,167
- What girl?
- "What girl?"

102
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,625
You just fucked her and dumped her,
didn't you?

103
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:59,333
- Poor little baby.
- Theresa, where's those salads?

104
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:03,042
OK, one oysters, one soup, an antipasti,
two duck and a steak rare.

105
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,708
Yes, Chef.

106
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,417
I'd have made her breakfast.

107
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,000
Strawberries,
heated the milk for her coffee.

108
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:14,417
But they don't want to fuck the nice guy.
They want to fuck the arsehole.

109
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,917
- Next two checks at the same time.
- Yes, Chef.

110
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,292
How about those ravioli, boys?
How long on those?

111
00:10:19,292 --> 00:10:22,000
- Three minutes, Chef.
- Right, right, right.

112
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,333
- Chef.
- OK, how do we know it's fresh?

113
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,917
- We smell it?
- No, check the eyes.

114
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,167
They should be clear.
The gills should be red.

115
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,750
- It should be firm. And the smell?
- Fishy?

116
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,208
It can smell fishy.
But, if it does, it's not fresh.

117
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,792
It should smell like the sea.
Does it smell like the sea?

118
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:39,375
- Mostly smells of fish.
- Get me another fucking sea bass.

119
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:42,792
One day.

120
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,167
One day, son, you'll be in love.

121
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,542
And you'll be miserable.
Table seven. That's your karma.

122
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:54,417
- Hot pot!
- Truly in love and miserable.

123
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,708
Richard, I need that pot back!

124
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,917
Richard!

125
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,750
[phone buzzes]

126
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:32,375
<i>- Hi, Jen.
- Hi, sweetheart.</i>

127
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:35,667
<i>- Listen... [inaudible]
- Really?</i>

128
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,458
<i>- Do you want to come with me?
- Of course I do.</i>

129
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,500
<i>Great.</i>

130
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,250
<i>I can find someone
else if you're busy.</i>

131
00:11:58,292 --> 00:12:00,708
Don't worry, it might not be that serious.

132
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,792
I'll call you as soon as I know more.

133
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,042
- OK?
[wolf whistle]

134
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,250
You wouldn't happen to have
a spare cigarette?

135
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,625
<i>- I'm on the phone.
- Who's that you're talking to?</i>

136
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:13,208
<i>Oh, nothing.
It's just a guy asking for a cigarette.</i>

137
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,750
<i>- OK, I better go.
- Yeah.</i>

138
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:16,583
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Hmm.

139
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,250
- OK, OK. Bye.
- Have you got a light?

140
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,333
How about board and lodging,
while we're at it?

141
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:27,375
Nah, I don't even know your name.

142
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,708
Do you have one, though?

143
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:35,042
Shit.

144
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,583
Oh, dear.

145
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm Michael.
I work in the restaurant there.

146
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:46,333
- All right, sailor.
- I'm a chef.

147
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,375
Good for you.

148
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,167
Come on, guys. What have we got?

149
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:56,333
We've checked all the Scottish cases
but have no obvious matches.

150
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,875
No proteins mutating, no prions, nothing.

151
00:12:58,917 --> 00:13:02,667
There's nothing to say it's a virus.
Nothing that matches anything we know.

152
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,833
But it's fair to say
it isn't obviously contagious.

153
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,625
It's fair to say it's spreading.

154
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,667
OK.

155
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:13,292
Could be environmental, it could be
a toxin we know nothing about.

156
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,833
It could be terrorism.

157
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:18,625
OK, so it's not a contagion.

158
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:24,125
I'll tell them... probably disappear
in a short while and don't panic.

159
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,917
Maybe they put something in the water.

160
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:55,583
<i>Overwhelmed with grief.</i>

161
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:59,750
<i>People are hit with all
that they've lost.</i>

162
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,667
<i>Lovers they never had.</i>

163
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,167
<i>All the departed friends.</i>

164
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:18,167
<i>They think of all the
people they've hurt.</i>

165
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,708
<i>First, overwhelmed with grief.</i>

166
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,917
<i>And then no sense of smell.</i>

167
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:47,917
<i>That's the disease.</i>

168
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:57,750
<i>They call it Severe
Olfactory Syndrome.</i>

169
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,250
<i>SOS.</i>

170
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,250
<i>TV: This is a cause for concern and
requires a heightened state of alert.</i>

171
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,667
<i>But it's not a cause for alarm.</i>

173
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,833
<i>We stand ready for the arrival</i>

174
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,917
<i>of the first confirmed

177
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,750
<i>They say it isn't contagious.</i>

178
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,458
<i>But who dare believe that?</i>

179
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,875
Nothing.

180
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,917
Well, shall we call it a night?

181
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,042
I don't know what the fuck
we should call it.

182
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,292
Let's go chase some pretty ladies, huh?

183
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:39,042
- You chase, I'll pick up the pieces.
- I don't feel like it.

184
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:42,292
Come on.
You want to watch that, Rich.

185
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,250
That's what happens when you have
too much high-class fanny.

186
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:47,458
He's been gorging himself
on Europe's finest.

187
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,917
- I'm going to get the Entonox quick!
- What's that?

188
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,042
Entonox. Laughing gas. Saint Nitrous.

189
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,042
Patron saint of pastry chefs.

190
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,333
Richard, don't. It'll make you feel...

191
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:58,792
James, leave him alone.

192
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,250
- Ssh.
- James.

193
00:17:00,292 --> 00:17:02,917
- I recommend it for you especially, sir.
- Put it back.

194
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,333
What? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop, stop.

195
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,542
Sniff my finger?

196
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,917
Yeah? I can smell that. Oranges.

197
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,042
Wrong. Balls.

198
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,708
Man down! Man down!

199
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,583
Quickly, evacuate! Evacuate!

200
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:21,792
- Good night.
- See you later.

201
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,708
- See you later, boss.
- Cheers, boys.

202
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,375
Good night.

203
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,542
- Keep smiling.
- Good night, James.

204
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,500
- Got your own smokes tonight, sailor?
- I'm still a chef.

205
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,500
My dad called everybody sailor.

206
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:57,792
He worked in the docks all his life.

207
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:01,000
He never went sailing anywhere
but he called everybody sailor.

208
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:02,500
All right.

209
00:18:02,542 --> 00:18:06,208
Even people he didn't know.
"Hello, sailor." "Goodbye, sailor."

210
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,708
Well, you can call me sailor, if you like.
Or Michael.

211
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,625
When I was a child,
I thought it was really embarrassing.

212
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:16,667
Now I'm doing it myself.

213
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,375
Are you hungry?

214
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:26,250
People aren't eating in restaurants these
days and we've got a lot of spare food.

215
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,625
Hm.

216
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:47,125
This is... monkfish cheek.

217
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,750
Fish is my thing.

218
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,125
- Good?
- Mmm.

219
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,125
Mm.

220
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,292
[they laugh]

221
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:16,208
- I'm a bit greedy when I eat.
- Oh, that's all right.

222
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,542
I had a disorder when I was younger.

223
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,667
Just trying to catch up.

224
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:28,292
So what do you do...
when you're not eating?

225
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:32,083
- Death and misery.
- What?

226
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:36,458
I'm an epidemiologist.

227
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,500
I'll get you something sweet.

228
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:49,250
This is a mango jelly
and chocolate macaroons.

229
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:51,875
And...

230
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:55,833
I didn't make these.

231
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:59,292
I can't remember what the fuck
that's called, but it's got coconut in it.

232
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,083
God...

233
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,708
All that sailor stuff,
it reminds me of him.

234
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:10,667
My dad.

235
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,417
I miss him so much.

236
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,167
We had so much fun together.
He could always make me laugh.

237
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,208
Hey... Hey.

238
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:23,500
Let me get you...

239
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:28,250
Here. This is... This is clean.

240
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:32,917
Thank you. [blows nose]

241
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,292
OK.

242
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,375
[sobs]

243
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,125
Here, here. You're all right.

244
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,125
Do not stand so close. You never know.

245
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:57,250
- Oh, no, they say it's not contagious.
- We don't know.

246
00:20:57,292 --> 00:20:59,583
It's just something we tell people.

247
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,375
Look... Would you... Would you like me
to take you back to your home?

248
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,042
Yeah? Come on.

249
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:10,458
You take the cloth. I'll get the...

250
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,292
Come on, come on.

251
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,375
[rain falling]

252
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,625
[she sobs]

253
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,333
[stifled sobbing]

254
00:22:33,042 --> 00:22:35,042
[he sobs]

255
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,583
Oh...

256
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:22,250
- Hey.
- It's gone.

257
00:23:23,292 --> 00:23:25,875
The smell.

258
00:23:25,917 --> 00:23:28,208
All gone.

259
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:00,125
Well, I think I'll...

260
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:03,000
That was a crazy evening.

261
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:04,708
Yeah.

262
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:35,750
[clicks tongue]

263
00:24:35,792 --> 00:24:37,792
Good morning.

264
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:39,208
[sniffs]

265
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,167
Mmm. Well, it has its benefits.

266
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:45,375
- Yep.
[he sniffs]

267
00:24:50,417 --> 00:24:52,500
We were in the Algarve once,
Maggie and me.

268
00:24:52,542 --> 00:24:56,000
Came home, had a freezer full of food,
there'd been a power cut.

269
00:24:56,042 --> 00:24:58,833
Never smelt anything so disgusting
in my life.

270
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:00,917
I'll never forget it.

271
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,750
Maybe you will.

272
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:08,708
Hm.

273
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,250
I've met someone.

274
00:25:14,292 --> 00:25:17,250
- Oh, OK.
- I'm pathetic.

275
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:19,292
Mm-hm.

276
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:21,500
I'm not even sure I like him.

277
00:25:22,292 --> 00:25:23,708
OK.

278
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,333
I actually think he's a smooth arsehole.

279
00:25:34,042 --> 00:25:35,500
Now...

280
00:25:37,292 --> 00:25:39,583
It'll probably come back.

281
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:43,000
But at the moment our customers
won't be able to smell, so...

282
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:46,250
It'll be like cooking
for snotty-nosed people.

283
00:25:48,042 --> 00:25:50,167
Bring out the big guns, all right?

284
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:54,125
Maybe a bit of saffron.

285
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:03,125
Oregano.

286
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:08,833
Richard, can you get me a clean apple?

287
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:13,917
<i>Life goes on.</i>

288
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:17,500
<i>The food becomes spicier...</i>

289
00:26:18,292 --> 00:26:20,125
<i>..saltier...</i>

290
00:26:20,167 --> 00:26:21,625
<i>more sweet...</i>

291
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:23,292
<i>more sour.</i>

292
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,625
<i>You get used to it.</i>

293
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,833
<i>The greater loss are all the memories
that are no longer triggered.</i>

294
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:35,875
<i>Ooh-hoo!</i>

295
00:26:35,917 --> 00:26:38,667
<i>Smell and memory
were connected in the brain.</i>

296
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:43,750
<i>Cinnamon might have reminded you
of your grandmother's apron.</i>

297
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:47,667
<i>The scent of cut hay
could evoke a childhood fear of cows.</i>

298
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:53,000
<i>Diesel oil might bring back memories
of your first ferry crossing.</i>

299
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:59,125
<i>Without smell,
an ocean of past images disappears.</i>

300
00:27:22,667 --> 00:27:24,208
Whoa!

301
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:34,208
[he whistles]

302
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:38,125
[whistles again]

303
00:27:42,292 --> 00:27:44,500
I'm off work.

304
00:27:44,542 --> 00:27:46,708
Congratulations.

305
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,833
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

306
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:52,667
Any more news on death and misery?

307
00:27:53,417 --> 00:27:54,875
Not really.

308
00:27:55,917 --> 00:27:58,208
I was a really good smeller.

309
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,292
- I bet you were.
- I was.

310
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,500
Do you want a cigarette?

311
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:06,167
- No, thanks.
- Something else, then?

312
00:28:07,292 --> 00:28:09,750
- Like what?
- Oh, er... are you hungry?

313
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,500
Nah.

314
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:14,500
I could cook you something special.

315
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:17,083
Or buy you a lollipop.

316
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:20,625
We could go for a coffee
and eat apple pie and er... liquorice.

317
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:23,250
A glass of wine?

318
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:25,833
Some fresh air?

319
00:28:27,917 --> 00:28:29,917
Come on.

320
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:33,792
[violin music]

321
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:36,458
My sister got married here
a few years ago

322
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,667
and I came to stay for a month and...

323
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:42,417
- Met a guy.
- And then a good job came up.

324
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:44,208
And now, ladies and gentlemen.

325
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,083
We'll call upon a new smell.

326
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:48,792
The scent of the forest
after the spring rain.

327
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,000
We imagine the path
underneath our feet.

328
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:57,042
We see the green moist color
surrounding us.

329
00:28:57,708 --> 00:29:02,333
And we feel the wet branches
against our faces.

330
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:07,583
And now imagine...

331
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:10,292
- Oh...
- We pass between the trees.

332
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,917
- I'm not going on my own. Come on.
- Oh, no.

333
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,500
And we begin drawing in the air.

334
00:29:15,542 --> 00:29:17,583
Deep inside.

335
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:19,833
And enjoy the moment.

336
00:29:23,917 --> 00:29:26,125
The humidity level is high.

337
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:27,667
[plays dramatic tune]

338
00:29:32,917 --> 00:29:38,458
At the lower end there is the moss,
the fungi, the rotten leaves.

339
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:47,750
The middle tone is the tall, fresh grass.

340
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:51,125
A crisp and almost invigorating scent.

341
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:53,917
[plucks high notes]

342
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:58,542
And at the top we feel
not only the leaves and the rainwater,

343
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:00,583
but also the sky.

344
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:02,417
[high, ringing note]

345
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,833
On a day like this...
we can smell the sky itself.

346
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:10,708
[mellow tune]

347
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:23,250
What shall we do now?

348
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:29,083
Well, now you could invite me
back to your place.

349
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:32,625
Don't know if I will.

350
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:37,167
Well, you... you can just start
walking home...

351
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:39,833
..and I'll follow you.

352
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:55,667
[she laughs]

353
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:30,208
- Oh.
[they laugh]

354
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,500
[sniffs]

355
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,583
Mm.

356
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:55,000
I should have made a bigger effort
to sniff you

357
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:57,041
the first time we were lying here.

358
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,750
Mm.

359
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:03,666
A pity.

360
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:12,541
What do you want?

361
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,416
What do I want?

362
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:19,666
Yeah.

363
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:25,833
Well, soon I'd like to close my eyes
and try and go to sleep.

364
00:32:27,208 --> 00:32:32,041
Which is a big deal for me cos usually
I... I can't sleep in bed with someone.

365
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,333
I need to be by myself.

366
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:55,791
OK?

367
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:59,333
- Now?
- Now, yes.

368
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:02,166
You want me to leave?

369
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,250
I live here, so I guess you'll have to.

370
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:07,000
- Now?
- Yes, please.

371
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:12,000
Did I say something wrong?

372
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:38,666
Ah... Let me give you my... card,

373
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:43,250
in case you want to, you know...
call me or something.

374
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:45,000
You have a card?

375
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:48,416
I had a catering company
that didn't do very well.

376
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:51,625
Not very many clients. Lots of cards.

377
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,416
You can call me.

378
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,541
My number's on there, and my address.

379
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,583
And I guess you know
where I work, so...

380
00:34:14,416 --> 00:34:16,416
[door bangs]

381
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:31,416
MAN: Repent, sinners!
The day of the Lord is upon you.

382
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,083
Do you know that this is
the day of the Lord?

383
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:36,291
The prophecy has been spoken.

384
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:40,083
Do you pray?
Are you aware of your sins?

385
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:43,500
Come back and be aware.
This is the day of the prophecy!

386
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,333
Hello.

387
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:32,208
No flowers?

388
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:42,166
She loved flowers, Michael.

389
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,541
Ian got married...

390
00:36:01,416 --> 00:36:03,416
in a church with the full monty.

391
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,458
Eugh!

392
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,666
Apparently, she's pregnant, his bride.

393
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,250
And what about this Michael?

394
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,750
What about him?

395
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,500
He sounds nice.

396
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,833
I don't know.

397
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:22,875
I usually pick arseholes.

398
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:27,166
Well, they can't all be arseholes.
They just can't.

399
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:30,750
- I'm trying to take care of myself.
- Right.

400
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,250
You do that a lot, don't you?

401
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:37,875
- Fuck you, sailor!
[laughs]

402
00:36:37,916 --> 00:36:40,166
[children clamouring]

403
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:42,625
Can I have sweets?

404
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:44,666
Let me see.

405
00:36:44,708 --> 00:36:46,208
Hmm...

406
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:49,500
- Ta-da!
- Whoo!

407
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,541
- What do you say?
- One for you and one for you.

408
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:54,583
Not soap.

409
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,416
Big Soap. Big Soap.

410
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,583
Apparently, Big Tobacco and
Big Fizzy Cola have formed this cartel

411
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:08,833
to start selling <i>wait for it</i>
fruity flavoured oxygen.

412
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:13,125
In order to create a proper market for it,
they've enlisted Big Soap.

413
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:18,000
Big Soap have flooded the environment
with enough organophosphates

414
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:21,125
to temporarily disable
your central nervous system.

415
00:37:21,166 --> 00:37:23,166
That's why I've stopped washing...

416
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:25,750
in case you were wondering
what the smell was.

417
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,750
You don't half talk some shite.

418
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,250
<i>Environmental groups are sure it's
the start of an ecological apocalypse</i>

419
00:37:35,291 --> 00:37:38,791
<i>caused by pollution and genetically
modified plants and hormones.</i>

420
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:42,750
<i>Intelligence claims
it's an attack on the free world.</i>

421
00:37:43,416 --> 00:37:45,833
<i>All indicators point
to fundamentalists.</i>

422
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:50,000
<i>The fundamentalists talk of God's
punishment on a world of unbelievers...</i>

423
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:53,208
<i>and promise that all pure people
of the right faith</i>

424
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:56,166
<i>will regain their sense of smell

425
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,250
<i>Others talk of the degenerate
capitalist system</i>

426
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:04,125
<i>that has released a military virus
to stimulate the economy.</i>

427
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,250

[shouting]

429
00:38:37,708 --> 00:38:41,500
STEPHEN: Wake up.
There is so much hatred in the world!

430
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,541
There's so much hatred!

431
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:46,291
- Easy.
- So much hatred in the world!

432
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:49,250
- They're fucking plotting against us.
- Stephen, calm down.

433
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:52,291
They want to blow us up.
They want to destroy us.

434
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:55,291
Fucking so much...

435
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,583
- So much hatred.
- Ssh, ssh.

436
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:01,125
There.

437
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:05,875
So many sharp edges.
So many sharp edges.

438
00:39:05,916 --> 00:39:07,791
- That's OK.
- Sharp things.

439
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:10,208
I've just given him
as much sedative as I dare.

440
00:39:10,208 --> 00:39:12,666
- So many sharp edges.
- It'll kick in in a second.

441
00:39:12,708 --> 00:39:14,708
So many sharp edges.

442
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,250
- Normally so soft. We are so soft.
- It's all right.

Hey, are you all right?

446
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:14,583
I can't die alone.

447
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:16,625
I'm here with you. I'm Barbara.

448
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:18,291
I work in research.

449
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:21,000
- I've seen you in the canteen.
- That's how it'll end.

450
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,041
Without anybody loving me.

451
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:26,125
Come on, now, just calm down.

452
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:27,583
What's your name?

453
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:30,541
Oh, no.

454
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:32,708
See, the thing is, your body, OK?

455
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,458
It betrays... It betrays itself.

456
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,125
- Stop, Michael.
- No, no, listen.

457
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:38,833
Your body,
it takes away the color of your skin.

458
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:41,208
And... And betrays your... your spirit.

459
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,708
Michael, stop.

460
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,750
Can I get some water over here?

461
00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:47,000
That's OK, it's OK.

462
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:50,666
Pissing and bleeding and fucking puss
is coming out of your ear!

463
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:53,250
- There's no puss.
- I've seen it. I've seen it!

464
00:40:53,291 --> 00:40:55,166
At the end, you're all alone.

465
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,583
Don't say that.

466
00:40:56,625 --> 00:40:58,750
You die on your own and it gets all dark.

467
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:01,791
It's not true! Don't say that!
You're not on your own!

468
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:03,833
You're not on your own!

469
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:07,208
All your body, it turns...
it turns to fucking soup.

470
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:08,458
<i>First the terror.</i>

471
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,583
Don't leave me. Don't leave me, Michael.

472
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:13,625
Don't leave me.

473
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:17,708
<i>And then a moment of hunger.</i>

Oh, my God. What's happened?

00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:23,416
Oh, my God, what's happened?
What's happening?

00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:25,875
Do you think
we'll lose our other senses too?

483
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,583
Smell and taste are related.

484
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:33,625
They're the two chemical senses.

485
00:44:34,833 --> 00:44:37,250
So the other ones
might be all right, then?

486
00:44:38,166 --> 00:44:39,875
They might.

487
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:41,916
Just have to wait and see.

488
00:44:42,916 --> 00:44:44,916
That's right, sailor.

489
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:53,250
And what happens if you're wrong?

490
00:45:00,708 --> 00:45:02,750
[whispers]:
Then we're fucked.

491
00:46:47,833 --> 00:46:49,416
Hey.

492
00:46:49,458 --> 00:46:51,125
Hi.

493
00:46:52,625 --> 00:46:54,625
It's still out there.

494
00:46:55,708 --> 00:46:57,708
What is?

495
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,750
The world.

496
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:03,250
What can you see?

497
00:47:03,333 --> 00:47:05,208
People.

498
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:07,250
What are they doing?

499
00:47:08,166 --> 00:47:10,166
They're heading off to work.

500
00:47:13,916 --> 00:47:15,916
What should we do?

501
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:21,250
We go to work as well.

502
00:47:25,291 --> 00:47:27,291
Do we kiss each other first...

503
00:47:29,208 --> 00:47:30,791
Maybe.

504
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:35,250
..Say we'd like to see each other again?

505
00:47:36,791 --> 00:47:38,791
We probably do.

506
00:47:38,833 --> 00:47:40,833
Maybe even this evening.

507
00:47:47,708 --> 00:47:48,791
Maybe.

508
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:53,250
And are we looking forward to that?

509
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:55,875
Yes!

510
00:48:04,541 --> 00:48:06,541
I may not even have a job any more.

511
00:48:11,666 --> 00:48:14,458
Forget it, Michael, we're closed.
We're closed.

512
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,500
We'll open again.

People can't smell, they can't taste.

They're going to buy flour and fat.

515

That's all you need to survive.

516
00:48:26,666 --> 00:48:28,666
Take a hit on that. Go on. Go on.

517
00:48:29,666 --> 00:48:31,125
Drink that.

518
00:48:31,166 --> 00:48:33,250
Now, that is damned expensive brandy.

519
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:35,250
Damned, damned expensive.

520
00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:38,500
But you might as well
drink surgical spirit or sniff glue.

521

It doesn't matter.

522
00:48:40,583 --> 00:48:42,125
Flour and fat.

523
00:48:42,166 --> 00:48:44,500
- And yet it does matter.
- There's no difference.

524
00:48:44,541 --> 00:48:46,208
No, I think you're wrong.

MICHAEL:
Oh, Jesus.

706
01:04:07,541 --> 01:04:09,875
So all of a sudden, we're living together.

707
01:04:09,916 --> 01:04:11,166
Yeah.

708
01:04:11,208 --> 01:04:12,916
Mr and Mrs Arsehole.

709
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,083
Hmm.

710
01:04:16,791 --> 01:04:19,041
We could play
"make me special" games.

711
01:04:20,125 --> 01:04:22,125
We could play at lovers.

712
01:04:23,916 --> 01:04:25,916
And we could fuck.

713
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,500
But you're just like all the others.

714
01:04:33,166 --> 01:04:35,791
Don't you think that you matter,
cos you don't.

715
01:04:35,833 --> 01:04:37,416
You're nothing.

716
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,208
You are just passing time.

717
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,208
It's not difficult to understand.

718
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:43,000
It's just fucking.

719
01:04:43,041 --> 01:04:45,583
And eating. And fat and flour.

720
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:51,625
You go out there, you lie down
on your back and spread your legs.

721
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:56,125
Or take your profound conversations
and your emotions and fuck off.

722
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:00,333
You're just a pair of ears and a mouth,

723
01:05:00,416 --> 01:05:02,000
an arsehole and a cunt.

724
01:05:02,041 --> 01:05:05,125
It might surprise you to know this
but everyone else has that too.

725
01:05:05,666 --> 01:05:08,208
A pair of ears and an arsehole.

726
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:10,125
Fat and fucking flour.

727
01:05:10,166 --> 01:05:12,166
Nothing special about this one,

728
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:14,208
except that she's infertile.

729
01:05:15,041 --> 01:05:17,791
Fat and flour. Fat and flour!

730
01:05:17,833 --> 01:05:19,833
Fat and fucking flour!

731
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:23,041
Fat and fucking flour!

[clattering and banging]

733

Fat and flour!

Fat, fat, fucking flour!

Let me in! Let me in!

743
01:06:49,375 --> 01:06:51,375
Take me with you. Hey!

744
01:06:51,416 --> 01:06:52,541
Hey!

745
01:06:52,583 --> 01:06:54,583
Come on, let me in!

SUSAN:
Hello?

750
01:08:33,875 --> 01:08:35,416
Can you hear me?

751
01:08:36,916 --> 01:08:38,375
Pardon?

752
01:08:41,916 --> 01:08:43,500
Seen anyone else?

753
01:09:56,708 --> 01:09:58,708
[mobile phone buzzes]

I hope you can hear this</i>

755

<i>Whatever!
Said to you, I didn't mean.</i>

756
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:15,250
<i>It wasn't me.</i>

757
01:10:15,333 --> 01:10:17,333
<i>It was the disease.</i>

758

[clatter]

759
01:10:24,458 --> 01:10:26,000
It was not you.

It was not you.

761

It's not me.

762

It's nobody.

763
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:33,916
Nothing.

764
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Nobody's here. Nobody.

765
01:10:36,041 --> 01:10:37,250
No.

766
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:41,375
Disease. Which disease?

767
01:10:42,916 --> 01:10:44,416
Where is it?

768
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:46,416
Where are you hiding, you fucking cunt?

Why? Why?

01:11:21,583 --> 01:11:23,791
<i>- Why?
- It's me asking you to come back.</i>

01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:17,791
<i>There are two movements now.</i>

790
01:16:17,833 --> 01:16:22,000
<i>There are the people who run through
the streets, grabbing all they can.</i>

791
01:16:23,166 --> 01:16:26,875
<i>People who don't believe in anything
but the end of the world.</i>

792
01:16:30,041 --> 01:16:32,583
<i>Then there's the other movement...</i>

793
01:16:32,625 --> 01:16:35,458
<i>farmers going out to
milk their cows...</i>

794
01:16:36,416 --> 01:16:38,708
<i>..soldiers reporting for duty.</i>

795
01:16:46,875 --> 01:16:49,791
<i>Those who believe
that life will go on somehow...</i>

796
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,375
<i>..or just don't know
what else to do.</i>

<i>People prepare for the worst...</i>

801

<i>..but hope for the best.</i>

802
01:20:34,541 --> 01:20:37,708

<i>glaciers slowly spreading...</i>

808
01:22:12,875 --> 01:22:15,250
<i>temperatures gradually dropping.</i>

809
01:22:19,875 --> 01:22:23,458
<i>But recently a number of intact
mammoths have been discovered</i>

810
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:26,166
<i>with stomachs full of
undigested grass.</i>

811
01:22:28,833 --> 01:22:31,875

<i>A shared flinching
of the brain's temporal lobe.</i>

816

<i>A profound appreciation
of what it means to be alive.</i>

817
01:24:03,125 --> 01:24:07,500
<i>But most of all, a shared urge
to reach out to one another.</i>

818

<i>To offer warmth...</i>

819
01:24:17,125 --> 01:24:19,333

<i>and they know all they need to know.</i>

827
01:26:54,291 --> 01:26:56,625
<i>They kiss...</i>

828
01:26:56,666 --> 01:26:59,500
<i>and they feel each other's tears
on their cheeks.</i>

829
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:03,791
<i>And if there had been
anybody left to see them,</i>

830
01:27:03,833 --> 01:27:08,250
<i>then they would look like normal lovers
caressing each other's faces...</i>

<i>..oblivious to the
world around them.</i>

834
