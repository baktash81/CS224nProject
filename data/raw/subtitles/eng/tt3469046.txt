"Despicable Me 3 (2017)"

3
00:00:27,382 --> 00:00:29,192
Illuminat...

4
00:00:30,727 --> 00:00:32,305
Illuminat...

5
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,691
Illuminat...

6
00:00:34,716 --> 00:00:36,099
What?
A horn?

7
00:00:40,004 --> 00:00:42,291
Illumination!

8
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,953
The year was 1985, and the
number-one show on television was...

9
00:00:58,978 --> 00:01:01,596
Evil Bratt.

10
00:01:01,757 --> 00:01:05,627
The show starred young Balthazar Bratt
as a child prodigy

11
00:01:05,652 --> 00:01:10,233
and criminal mastermind
bent on world domination.

12
00:01:10,258 --> 00:01:12,239
There he is!
Get him!

13
00:01:15,188 --> 00:01:18,301
I've been a bad boy!

14
00:01:18,326 --> 00:01:21,307
Bratt was the biggest child actor
of the 1980s,

15
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:24,664
striking a chord with audiences
all over the world.

16
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:25,920
- Yay!
- Yeah!

17
00:01:26,097 --> 00:01:27,246
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

18
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:28,509
There he is!
Get him!

19
00:01:28,534 --> 00:01:31,332
But it all came to an end
in season three,

20
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:32,358
When...

21
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,912
I've been a bad boy!

22
00:01:34,937 --> 00:01:38,414
- The young star experienced
an unexpected growth spurt.
- Boy? Boy?

23
00:01:38,837 --> 00:01:41,634
The show was canceled.
Hollywood rejected him

24
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:45,073
and Bratt quickly plunged
into a downward spiral.

25
00:01:45,098 --> 00:01:50,289
Starting to actually believed he was
the character he played on TV.

26
00:01:50,314 --> 00:01:52,260
What are you looking at?

27
00:01:52,285 --> 00:01:54,161
Leading us all to wonder...

28
00:01:54,186 --> 00:01:56,477
Where is he now?

29
00:02:02,812 --> 00:02:04,129
You know what, Clive?

30
00:02:04,154 --> 00:02:06,653
Playing a villain on TV was fun,

31
00:02:06,678 --> 00:02:10,158
but being one in real life
is even better.

32
00:02:10,183 --> 00:02:11,564
Heist music!

33
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,417
Here it comes.

34
00:02:16,188 --> 00:02:17,301
What?
Clive!

35
00:02:17,326 --> 00:02:20,144
What are you doing?
How is that heist music?

36
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:22,203
Sorry, my bad.

37
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:56,457
Ewww!

38
00:02:56,482 --> 00:02:58,649
Wha-whoa!
Gah!

39
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,331
Mommy!

40
00:03:03,887 --> 00:03:05,235
Stop right...

41
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:07,720
ANTI VILLAIN LEAGUE   HEADQUARTERS

42
00:03:07,745 --> 00:03:11,227
Sir, the ship has been boarded by
some kind of... monster.

43
00:03:11,252 --> 00:03:13,112
Wait, that's not a monster.

44
00:03:13,137 --> 00:03:16,030
That's a man wearing shoulder pads.

45
00:03:16,055 --> 00:03:19,926
There's only one supervillain whose
fashion sense is quite that dated,

46
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:21,913
Balthazar Bratt.

47
00:03:21,938 --> 00:03:24,641
Blast it!
The Dupont Diamond is on that ship!

48
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:29,184
I want every agent in the area
on the scene immediately.

49
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:33,036
Ha, ha, ha... !

50
00:03:33,076 --> 00:03:34,058
Woo-hoo!

51
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,900
We're already here!
Agents Grucy are closing in fast.

52
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,617
Yes... wait, wha?
What did you call us?

53
00:03:39,642 --> 00:03:42,555
Grucy. You know,
Gru and Lucy mushed together.

54
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,603
Try it.

55
00:03:43,628 --> 00:03:46,034
Haha!
I like it, but not a lot,

56
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,775
I don't like it.

57
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:53,474
Stop!

58
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:54,850
On the ground!

59
00:04:15,748 --> 00:04:17,504
The jewel!
Move!

60
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:19,132
Go, go, go!

61
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,243
Don't move.

62
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,355
Uh?

63
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,639
Too late again, Gru.
Ha, ha, ha... !

64
00:04:43,757 --> 00:04:45,921
WHAAA... ?

65
00:04:45,946 --> 00:04:46,959
He's getting away!!

66
00:04:46,984 --> 00:04:48,809
That's what he thinks.

67
00:04:51,882 --> 00:04:54,754
- Wahooo!
- Ha, ha!

68
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:56,555
Go, go!

69
00:04:57,074 --> 00:04:58,780
Ugh!
Go, go.

70
00:04:58,805 --> 00:05:00,704
Go, go, go!

71
00:05:03,787 --> 00:05:05,608
I don't think
we can make it, Gru.

72
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:07,320
We can make it!

73
00:05:09,037 --> 00:05:13,600
We can make it... !

74
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,341
No, we can't!

75
00:05:16,835 --> 00:05:19,040
Get ready!

76
00:05:19,596 --> 00:05:23,704
Get ready for whaaa... !

77
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:34,584
Hey.
How're you doing?

78
00:05:37,078 --> 00:05:38,317
Are you okay?

79
00:05:38,342 --> 00:05:40,357
- Hello.
- Oh.

80
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,278
You guys are so cute.

81
00:05:42,303 --> 00:05:44,218
Go get him, Gru Gru!

82
00:05:44,584 --> 00:05:46,422
Hello, Gru.

83
00:05:47,128 --> 00:05:48,628
How's your transition coming?

84
00:05:48,653 --> 00:05:52,336
You know, from world's worst villain
to world's worst agent?

85
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:54,751
Oh, that's hilarious!
You should be on TV!

86
00:05:54,776 --> 00:05:56,804
Oh, that's right,
you were...

87
00:05:56,829 --> 00:05:58,874
but then you got canceled.

88
00:05:59,288 --> 00:06:00,804
Ha ha!

89
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:02,491
What about that?

90
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,697
Whaaa...
Oh! Girls… !

91
00:06:04,722 --> 00:06:05,726
Oh!

92
00:06:07,829 --> 00:06:09,314
Dance fight!

93
00:06:22,074 --> 00:06:23,461
Ow!

94
00:06:27,369 --> 00:06:29,581
Alpha team, the diamond is secure.

95
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:31,344
Come and pick up the package.

96
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:33,857
Copy that, Alpha team on approach.

97
00:06:39,241 --> 00:06:40,645
Gru.

98
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,008
- Did you actually think
I was unconscious?
- Oh.

99
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:45,137
It's called acting, hoser!

100
00:06:45,162 --> 00:06:48,035
And clearly I've still got it!

101
00:07:02,557 --> 00:07:06,893
I've been a baaaaaaaad boy!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

102
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:08,121
Freeze!
Don't move!

103
00:07:08,146 --> 00:07:09,518
Son of a Betamax!

104
00:07:09,543 --> 00:07:11,054
Go! Go!
Get him! Get him!

105
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,886
He's getting away!

106
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:16,386
This isn't over, Gru!
You hear me?

107
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:18,440
This is not over!

108
00:07:18,465 --> 00:07:21,917
Yeah?
Well, I still have the diamond!

109
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:27,675
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to...

110
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:33,196
Happy birthday, dear Daaaaaan.

111
00:07:33,221 --> 00:07:37,751
Happy birthday to you.

112
00:07:37,776 --> 00:07:40,811
- Ha, ha, ha, ha!
- Ha, ha, ha, ha!

113
00:07:40,946 --> 00:07:43,248
- Hey, you ready?
- Yeah!

114
00:07:43,273 --> 00:07:47,136
Party!
Party, everyone!

115
00:07:52,376 --> 00:07:56,757
DESPICABLE ME 3

116
00:08:00,175 --> 00:08:02,153
Hey!
Watch it!

117
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,149
I can't believe
Bratt got away, again.

118
00:08:11,174 --> 00:08:14,016
How is this possible?
How...

119
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:25,076
And it's not just that he got away!
It's that he's so smug about it!

120
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:28,761
Ewww.
I've been a baaaaaaaad boy!

121
00:08:28,786 --> 00:08:30,348
Edna, hey.

122
00:08:30,373 --> 00:08:32,159
Looking hot... today.

123
00:08:32,184 --> 00:08:34,104
Got the... cats on you.

124
00:08:34,136 --> 00:08:36,332
And it was just so humiliating.

125
00:08:36,357 --> 00:08:39,530
Dangling there in the
bubble-gum Speedo.

126
00:08:39,555 --> 00:08:41,933
And I didn't have time to go
to the gym this week!

127
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,521
And I had a big breakfast!

128
00:08:44,546 --> 00:08:47,386
I was feeling a little bloated!

129
00:08:49,055 --> 00:08:51,260
You know what?
He's not even worth talking about.

130
00:08:51,285 --> 00:08:55,701
I don't even want to waste
another breath about the guy.

131
00:08:55,726 --> 00:08:57,245
And another thing!

132
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:02,556
Next time I see Bratt, I will
moonwalk all over his stupid face!

133
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,578
Thank you all for coming
in such short notice.

134
00:09:10,603 --> 00:09:15,723
It is with great sadness that
I inform you that as of today

135
00:09:15,748 --> 00:09:19,947
I am retiring as
head of the AVL.

136
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,969
Oh no.

137
00:09:22,994 --> 00:09:30,786
Your new leader is coming directly from
head office, effective immediately.

138
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:38,732
She is the very gifted, very ambitious
Miss Valerie Da Vinci.

139
00:09:38,757 --> 00:09:44,598
As I look out over all of your faces,
I am flooded with so many memories.

140
00:09:44,623 --> 00:09:47,871
- Oh boy, this is a snoozeday.
- I... Excuse me.

141
00:09:47,896 --> 00:09:51,930
Blah blah blah. We understand.
You're old, you're fat, you're done.

142
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,058
Let me breathe in.

143
00:09:55,404 --> 00:09:57,836
Woo.
Broke a little sweat there.

144
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,880
First order of business.

145
00:10:00,905 --> 00:10:04,135
Which one of you losers
is Agent Gru?!

146
00:10:05,024 --> 00:10:07,311
Uh… that would be me.

147
00:10:07,336 --> 00:10:11,729
Although I don't know
if I'd say 'loser' per Se,

148
00:10:11,754 --> 00:10:13,551
kind of a...
Huh!

149
00:10:15,272 --> 00:10:18,810
Oh, it's the girls.
Not a good time.

150
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:20,302
- Hey!
- Aaah!

151
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:23,283
Yes, sir.
Huh, uh... ma'am.

152
00:10:23,308 --> 00:10:24,674
You're making me nervous.

153
00:10:24,699 --> 00:10:27,716
How could you let Balthazar Bratt,

154
00:10:27,741 --> 00:10:31,417
the AVL's most-wanted villain,
just get away?

155
00:10:31,442 --> 00:10:33,729
That is the opposite of
what we do here!

156
00:10:33,754 --> 00:10:37,922
Okay, okay, yes,
maybe he got away... again,

157
00:10:37,947 --> 00:10:40,722
but he didn't get the diamond!

158
00:10:40,747 --> 00:10:43,838
And I am this close
to bringing him in.

159
00:10:43,863 --> 00:10:46,069
This close!

160
00:10:46,099 --> 00:10:47,874
Huh?
Interesting.

161
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:49,208
You're fired!

162
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:50,389
Huh!
What?

163
00:10:50,414 --> 00:10:53,275
This is totally not fair.
Gru is a great agent.

164
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,680
You know what?
If you fire him,

165
00:10:54,705 --> 00:10:57,118
you're going to have to fire me,
sister sister.

166
00:10:57,143 --> 00:11:00,849
And do you really want to do that?
Do ya?

167
00:11:00,874 --> 00:11:02,740
No, no, no, no, no.

168
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:10,762
Well, I guess she did!

169
00:11:16,318 --> 00:11:18,088
Honey, you didn't have to do that.

170
00:11:18,113 --> 00:11:19,875
I know how much
you love your job.

171
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,038
Well, I love other things more.

172
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:27,464
You know, we're going to
have to tell the girls.

173
00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:29,257
Can you do it?

174
00:11:29,282 --> 00:11:32,088
The whole Mom thing is
still kind of new to me.

175
00:11:32,113 --> 00:11:33,906
Oh, sure.

176
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,223
Hello?

177
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,592
- Aloha!
- Aloha!

178
00:12:02,798 --> 00:12:04,157
Oh!

179
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,033
This is unexpected.

180
00:12:07,058 --> 00:12:09,522
Well, you never got to go
on a honeymoon, so…

181
00:12:09,547 --> 00:12:10,807
We made you dinner!

182
00:12:10,832 --> 00:12:11,975
It's a luau!

183
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,781
We got pineapples and
coconuts and lukuleles!

184
00:12:14,806 --> 00:12:17,108
- Oh ho, yeah.
- Yeah.

185
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:21,012
Hey!
Ya malatika tika, hee ha!

186
00:12:21,037 --> 00:12:23,026
Oww oww oww ah ah ah!

187
00:12:23,051 --> 00:12:25,423
Oww oww oww ah ah ah!

188
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,359
Ahem.

189
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:35,049
The soup of the day,
madame and monsieur.

190
00:12:35,074 --> 00:12:37,617
The gummy bears were my idea.

191
00:12:41,445 --> 00:12:44,839
Mmmmmm…
Looks too good to even eat!

192
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,480
Am I right?

193
00:12:46,921 --> 00:12:50,119
- But I made it for you.…
- Oh.

194
00:12:53,396 --> 00:13:00,761
Good soup! I love the combination
of gummy bears and meat!

195
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,804
I'm gonna hold it
in my mouth,

196
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,789
because it's so good
I don't want to swallow it.

197
00:13:09,814 --> 00:13:11,473
So.
How was work?

198
00:13:11,498 --> 00:13:14,832
Did you take that guy down?
Did anything explode?

199
00:13:14,857 --> 00:13:19,533
Well, actually,
today Lucy and I

200
00:13:19,558 --> 00:13:24,635
were invited to not work
at the AVL anymore.

201
00:13:24,815 --> 00:13:26,872
Huh!
No!

202
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,852
You got fired?

203
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:32,741
Oh no!
No, no, no...

204
00:13:33,902 --> 00:13:35,471
- Yes.
- What?

205
00:13:35,496 --> 00:13:37,450
But don't worry,

206
00:13:37,475 --> 00:13:40,134
I'm sure we'll get
new jobs real soon.

207
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:42,402
Even better ones.

208
00:13:42,427 --> 00:13:46,003
What's better than being
super-cool secret agents?

209
00:13:46,777 --> 00:13:49,308
Oh, I know!
You could gamble online!

210
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,383
That's what Katie's dad does!

211
00:13:51,408 --> 00:13:54,273
Okay, we will definitely
look into that.

212
00:13:54,298 --> 00:13:56,147
That's a good suggestion.

213
00:13:56,172 --> 00:14:00,511
And let's not go over
to Katie's house anymore.

214
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:03,096
Hmm.

215
00:14:06,744 --> 00:14:09,345
Guys, shhhhhh.
I don't think you heard me right.

216
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:13,021
No, no, no, no, no, no, this does not mean
that we are going back to being villains.

217
00:14:13,046 --> 00:14:14,807
- Oh.
- Oh.

218
00:14:14,832 --> 00:14:16,289
Boring!
You weren't like this!

219
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,441
Okay, alright,
I get it.

220
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:21,047
Look, I know it's been
a little tough lately,

221
00:14:21,072 --> 00:14:26,988
especially with Doctor Nefario
accidentally freezing himself in carbonite,

222
00:14:28,898 --> 00:14:29,495
Ow!

223
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,304
but our life of crime is over!

224
00:14:34,119 --> 00:14:37,661
Mel.
Mel, you're with me on this, right?

225
00:14:38,071 --> 00:14:39,373
Look.

226
00:14:39,398 --> 00:14:41,016
- Good...
- Yay!

227
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,996
- Boring!
- Boo!

228
00:14:43,021 --> 00:14:44,695
- Good...
- Yay!

229
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,871
- Boring!
- Ohh!

230
00:14:46,896 --> 00:14:48,734
- Good...
- Yay!

231
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:51,430
- Boring!
- Boo!

232
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:53,978
Minions… no more boring!!

233
00:14:54,003 --> 00:14:56,400
Boring!
Boring!

234
00:14:56,425 --> 00:14:59,420
Guys!
Listen to me and read my lips!

235
00:14:59,445 --> 00:15:03,931
Lissa me lippo, pomodoro la comquit!

236
00:15:06,144 --> 00:15:07,889
What?
Wha...

237
00:15:07,914 --> 00:15:10,272
What did I say?
"la comquit?"

238
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:13,912
Oh, okay,
pomodoro la kumquat.

239
00:15:13,937 --> 00:15:16,228
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did you say no more crime?

240
00:15:16,253 --> 00:15:17,089
I cannot accept this.

241
00:15:17,114 --> 00:15:18,725
Don't take that tone with me!

242
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,791
We're not going back to villainy.

243
00:15:20,816 --> 00:15:22,136
Uh.
No villainy?

244
00:15:22,161 --> 00:15:25,885
Yes. And I don't want to hear
another word about it.

245
00:15:29,082 --> 00:15:31,684
Look, if you guys
don't stop that right now,

246
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:33,613
there will be consequences!

247
00:15:33,638 --> 00:15:35,680
Huh!
I can do whatever I want.

248
00:15:35,705 --> 00:15:36,145
Hey.

249
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,321
Don't say anything
you're going to regret.

250
00:15:38,346 --> 00:15:41,172
Oh. Listen to this.
I quit!

251
00:15:41,411 --> 00:15:42,895
See you!

252
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,050
What?
You quit?

253
00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:48,066
You're serious?
Come on.

254
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:53,184
Uh. Uh.
Bud-Buddy?

255
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:55,525
Dave!
Jerry!

256
00:15:56,325 --> 00:15:59,580
Great news, guys...
you've been promoted.

257
00:15:59,605 --> 00:16:03,470
You're in charge now, eh?
Not bad!

258
00:16:04,554 --> 00:16:07,464
Yipa! Yipo!
Yippee!

259
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:11,001
- Aruba-ruba-ruba-ruba!
- Aruba-ruba-ruba-ruba!

260
00:16:11,692 --> 00:16:13,329
Jeesh!

261
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:21,842
PARIS. FRANCE

262
00:16:25,725 --> 00:16:26,931
Huh!

263
00:16:32,785 --> 00:16:35,129
Monsieur Pompo.

264
00:16:35,354 --> 00:16:40,905
To what do we owe the presence
of the world's foremost gem expert?

265
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,897
The chief of police sent me.

266
00:16:42,922 --> 00:16:45,862
He was concerned that during
the recent heist attempt,

267
00:16:45,887 --> 00:16:50,034
The Dupont Diamond
was replaced with a phony.

268
00:17:06,908 --> 00:17:08,406
Ooh la la.

269
00:17:08,431 --> 00:17:11,186
You have been duped.

270
00:17:11,211 --> 00:17:12,677
What?
We have?

271
00:17:12,702 --> 00:17:13,875
Yes.

272
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,692
By me!

273
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:20,736
Wha-What is... ?

274
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,680
Oh no.
Help!

275
00:17:30,722 --> 00:17:32,968
Ha ha ha...

276
00:17:43,928 --> 00:17:46,787
I've been a bad boy!

277
00:17:46,812 --> 00:17:51,226
Or should I say,
"Je suis un mauvais garçon!"

278
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:06,651
Oh.

279
00:18:29,536 --> 00:18:32,621
Hey, Gru,
whatcha doing down here?

280
00:18:32,646 --> 00:18:34,383
In the dark.

281
00:18:34,408 --> 00:18:35,328
Alone.

282
00:18:35,353 --> 00:18:38,171
Oh nothing, just thinking.

283
00:18:38,196 --> 00:18:39,641
You okay?

284
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,318
Oh yes, yeah,
I'm fine, I'm fine.

285
00:18:42,343 --> 00:18:44,086
It's just…

286
00:18:44,503 --> 00:18:49,988
I don't know.
I guess I just feel like a… failure.

287
00:18:50,377 --> 00:18:52,673
Like I don't have
a purpose anymore.

288
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:56,203
Hey, mister,
you are not a failure.

289
00:18:56,228 --> 00:18:59,558
If only I could've nailed Bratt.

290
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:03,159
So many times
I almost had him!

291
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:05,724
But now I'll never
get the chance.

292
00:19:05,749 --> 00:19:07,848
'Cause I have been
kicked to the curb.

293
00:19:07,873 --> 00:19:11,513
Gru, you've got to let this go.
It's time to look forward.

294
00:19:11,538 --> 00:19:14,186
Things will get better, I promise.

295
00:19:31,242 --> 00:19:33,742
Follow me.
Follow me.

296
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:35,782
Coming through, make way.

297
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,580
- Coming through.
- Uh, excuse me.

298
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:41,424
Pardon me,
young... people.

299
00:19:41,449 --> 00:19:44,815
Would you tell me
how to get to this address?

300
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,611
Uh.
Uh, ah.

301
00:19:46,636 --> 00:19:48,110
You are looking for Minions?

302
00:19:48,135 --> 00:19:50,503
I'm looking for a Mr. Gru.

303
00:19:50,528 --> 00:19:52,757
Gru is a lousy boss!

304
00:19:53,219 --> 00:19:55,179
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

305
00:19:55,204 --> 00:19:56,602
Bye!

306
00:20:03,476 --> 00:20:05,195
Idiots.

307
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:10,590
No. Kyle.
Stop!

308
00:20:10,615 --> 00:20:12,653
Kyle, let go.

309
00:20:15,035 --> 00:20:16,285
BRATT STEALS WORLD'S
BIGGEST DIAMOND

310
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:19,483
No, no...
you've got to be kidding me.

311
00:20:19,508 --> 00:20:20,662
Lucy, did you see...

312
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:24,539
He helps you if you have nightmares,
and he's really good to snuggle with...

313
00:20:24,564 --> 00:20:26,282
Oh no, no, no, Agnes!
Agnes!

314
00:20:26,307 --> 00:20:28,496
So, take good care of him.

315
00:20:28,521 --> 00:20:30,222
Thank you!

316
00:20:30,247 --> 00:20:32,890
Agnes, what are you doing?
You...

317
00:20:32,915 --> 00:20:34,770
You sold your unicorn?

318
00:20:34,795 --> 00:20:38,927
Well, I just wanted to help.
Since you don't have a job.

319
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:41,706
I got two whole dollars for it!

320
00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:43,645
- Awwwww.
- Awwwww.

321
00:20:44,437 --> 00:20:46,183
Uh, excuse me.

322
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,318
Sorry, buddy, the sale's over.

323
00:20:48,343 --> 00:20:49,999
Yes, but this will only take a....

324
00:20:50,024 --> 00:20:52,366
Hey, Eyebrows.
Get off the lawn.

325
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:53,742
Yeah, but...

326
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:57,143
- Hey, could you...
- Oh uh, of course.

327
00:20:57,168 --> 00:20:59,542
Now, as I was saying.
I...

328
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:02,193
- Uh... Oh.
- Goodbye.

329
00:21:07,673 --> 00:21:10,199
Listen, Agnes.
You don't need to worry.

330
00:21:10,224 --> 00:21:12,025
We're going to be fine.

331
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,303
- For real?
- For real.

332
00:21:14,328 --> 00:21:16,126
Now come on,
let's pack this stuff up.

333
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:17,371
Ow.
Ow.

334
00:21:17,396 --> 00:21:20,893
Seriously?
Buddy, you're not getting the hint.

335
00:21:20,918 --> 00:21:23,651
Excuse me, Mr. Gru.

336
00:21:23,676 --> 00:21:27,011
But I really must
have a word with you.

337
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,601
How did you know my name?

338
00:21:28,626 --> 00:21:33,053
Allow me to introduce myself...
my name is Fritz, and OW!

339
00:21:33,078 --> 00:21:35,324
Uh, good puppy.

340
00:21:35,365 --> 00:21:39,868
And I am inquiring…
on behalf of your twin brother, Dru.

341
00:21:40,893 --> 00:21:42,395
He needs your help.

342
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,163
What?
Twin brother?

343
00:21:44,188 --> 00:21:45,254
Twin brother?

344
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,295
- Twin brother?
- Twin brother?

345
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,213
Oh Yeah.

346
00:21:47,238 --> 00:21:50,693
He would like to fly you
to Freedonia to meet him.

347
00:21:50,718 --> 00:21:54,598
Your father has recently
passed away and...

348
00:21:54,623 --> 00:21:57,514
Okay, cuckoo.
I'm sorry, but my dad died

349
00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:00,174
when I was a baby,
and I don't have any brother.

350
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:01,533
You've got the wrong guy.

351
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:02,741
Really?

352
00:22:02,766 --> 00:22:07,393
Well, then how do
you explain... this?

353
00:22:12,977 --> 00:22:16,027
Ahhhhh!
Bellissimo!

354
00:22:17,946 --> 00:22:20,982
- Oh, hello, Gru.
- Hi, Mom.

355
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:25,355
It's important to keep active
in one's golden years.

356
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,711
There you are, you cute cute.

357
00:22:32,348 --> 00:22:38,733
These are my diving instructors,
Vincenzo and Paolo!

358
00:22:39,471 --> 00:22:41,610
Ciao, boys!

359
00:22:41,797 --> 00:22:43,929
So what do you want?

360
00:22:43,954 --> 00:22:47,373
Mom, do I have a twin brother?

361
00:22:47,924 --> 00:22:49,971
How did you find out?
Who told you?

362
00:22:49,996 --> 00:22:51,442
Wait, what?
It's true?

363
00:22:51,467 --> 00:22:53,556
You never told me
I had a brother!

364
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:57,109
And you told me that Dad died of
disappointment when I was born!

365
00:22:57,134 --> 00:23:00,674
Yeah, yeah, that was the agreement.

366
00:23:00,699 --> 00:23:04,175
Agreement?
What are you talking about?

367
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:12,104
Shortly after you and your brother
were born, your father and I divorced.

368
00:23:12,129 --> 00:23:15,449
We each took one son
to raise on our own.

369
00:23:15,474 --> 00:23:19,372
And promised never
to see each other again.

370
00:23:20,447 --> 00:23:25,354
Obviously, I got second pick.

371
00:23:27,398 --> 00:23:29,763
I have a brother.

372
00:23:36,376 --> 00:23:39,185
Hey girls, how are things
in row B, huh?

373
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,755
I've put together some
fun activities for the trip.

374
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,760
Who is up for some
Gin Rummy?

375
00:23:44,785 --> 00:23:48,646
Yeah. Umm...
We're good.

376
00:23:48,671 --> 00:23:50,546
Oh.
Okay.

377
00:23:50,571 --> 00:23:53,208
I'll just sit here
and play solitaire.

378
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:54,932
I hope I win.

379
00:23:55,581 --> 00:23:57,695
I wonder what Dru
will be like!

380
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,165
Woo!

381
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,959
Maybe we'll have that twin thing

382
00:23:59,984 --> 00:24:03,030
where we can read
each other's minds, you know?

383
00:24:03,055 --> 00:24:06,817
- How cool would that be?!
- Um, super cool.

384
00:24:13,739 --> 00:24:16,553
Ah, ha ha ha...

385
00:24:16,578 --> 00:24:18,327
Ooh.

386
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:22,254
Aah!
Ow! Ow!

387
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:23,794
Woo-hoo!

388
00:24:23,819 --> 00:24:28,078
Freedonia!
Freedonia!

389
00:24:28,393 --> 00:24:30,239
Hi, piggy, piggy!

390
00:24:30,264 --> 00:24:33,701
Huh! Whoa!
Look at that house!

391
00:24:33,726 --> 00:24:35,351
It's like a castle!

392
00:24:35,376 --> 00:24:39,391
I can't wait
to meet my brother!

393
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:41,598
Uh.
What's with all the pigs?

394
00:24:41,623 --> 00:24:43,958
This is the family business.

395
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:47,864
The largest pig farm
in the whole of Freedonia.

396
00:24:48,349 --> 00:24:50,659
Okay, nice pig.

397
00:24:51,071 --> 00:24:53,908
No!
That's my private part!

398
00:24:53,982 --> 00:24:56,235
Owww!

399
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,775
This pig has issues!

400
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:00,625
Please, come in.

401
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,879
Wow.
Yeah, haha!

402
00:25:08,982 --> 00:25:10,609
Whoa!

403
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,595
Oh, this is amazing!

404
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,792
Ah, it's like the Sistine Chapel.
But with pigs.

405
00:25:21,717 --> 00:25:29,507
My brother!!

406
00:25:29,532 --> 00:25:31,251
- My brother!
- My brother!

407
00:25:31,276 --> 00:25:32,510
Gru!

408
00:25:32,535 --> 00:25:34,256
Dru!

409
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:46,033
Ahhhh!
Brother! I am hugging you!

410
00:25:46,058 --> 00:25:47,955
I'm so happy!

411
00:25:48,245 --> 00:25:52,640
After all these years,
finally I'm meeting you!

412
00:25:52,665 --> 00:25:56,613
- Yup, alright, good.
- Oh, look at that!

413
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,843
- Woo!
- You must be the beautiful wife!

414
00:25:58,868 --> 00:26:02,024
Beautiful, oh.
Stop it!

415
00:26:02,049 --> 00:26:02,830
Sweet talker.

416
00:26:02,855 --> 00:26:06,750
How is my brother finding a wife
like you when he is so bald?

417
00:26:09,813 --> 00:26:14,050
Woo-hoo!
These must be my nieces!

418
00:26:14,075 --> 00:26:17,847
Huh! You're Agnes,
you're small with big eyes!

419
00:26:17,872 --> 00:26:20,091
And it makes me want to
put you in my pocket!

420
00:26:20,116 --> 00:26:23,407
You can't do that.
I'm too big.

421
00:26:23,432 --> 00:26:24,990
And Edith,

422
00:26:25,015 --> 00:26:28,480
I can tell that you are
a little mischievous.

423
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:31,121
We're going to have to make
a little trouble later.

424
00:26:31,146 --> 00:26:32,846
Wha...
I already have!

425
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:34,547
Ow.
Ow! Ow!

426
00:26:34,572 --> 00:26:37,215
Please, stop.
Why are you doing that?

427
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,606
Ow!
Ow.

428
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:42,082
Fist bump for mischievous behavior.

429
00:26:42,107 --> 00:26:45,109
And Margo!
Oh, you are so mature.

430
00:26:45,134 --> 00:26:47,949
I'm guessing what… fifteen?

431
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,184
Fifteen?

432
00:26:49,209 --> 00:26:52,827
She's twelve! She looks twelve.
And will always be twelve.

433
00:26:52,852 --> 00:26:55,939
So, Dru…
this place is amazing.

434
00:26:55,964 --> 00:26:59,707
I mean, you just walk through the doors
and you're like: wooooowwwooowwooooo!!

435
00:26:59,732 --> 00:27:05,159
Eh. It's nice, I guess, sure.
I'm not really into 'things.'

436
00:27:07,824 --> 00:27:09,917
Wow!
This is so cool!

437
00:27:09,942 --> 00:27:12,282
Oh my gosh,
he's even got a helicopter!

438
00:27:12,307 --> 00:27:14,294
This is the best!

439
00:27:14,439 --> 00:27:16,740
Yes, the best.

440
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:19,120
- All right, let's go home now.
- Home? Why?

441
00:27:19,145 --> 00:27:22,795
I don't know, this guy,
with the mansion and the cars

442
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:27,572
and… all the hair,
silky-smooth, luxurious hair.

443
00:27:27,597 --> 00:27:29,962
I feel worse than
I did before I came.

444
00:27:29,987 --> 00:27:32,766
Oh, but he's your brother, Gru.
Give him a chance.

445
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:36,362
Oh, I was thinking, while Gru and I
catch up on some brother stuff,

446
00:27:36,387 --> 00:27:39,065
you girls should go with Fritz.
He has a surprise for you.

447
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,322
- Yay!
- Yay!
- Awesome.

448
00:27:40,347 --> 00:27:41,627
I love surprises!

449
00:27:41,652 --> 00:27:43,859
Oh, this is perfect.
Mother, daughter bonding time.

450
00:27:43,884 --> 00:27:46,081
Let's do it.
Woo-woo!

451
00:27:46,223 --> 00:27:48,560
Bye!
You boys have fun.

452
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:51,620
Ha ha ha!
Whoopee!

453
00:27:54,149 --> 00:27:56,530
Now you can be as evil
as Balthazar Bratt

454
00:27:56,555 --> 00:27:59,010
with the evil Bratt action figure,

455
00:27:59,035 --> 00:28:02,758
featuring music activated
Break Dance mode.

456
00:28:02,783 --> 00:28:06,955
Also featuring bubble gum
launching shoulder pads.

457
00:28:07,082 --> 00:28:10,922
And the all new
Mega Diamond Laser.

458
00:28:12,641 --> 00:28:14,299
No more math!

459
00:28:14,324 --> 00:28:17,117
I've been a bad boy!

460
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:20,987
Mega Diamond Laser does not
actually incinerate books.

461
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:26,964
How could Hollywood cancel a show
that produced toys like this, Clive?

462
00:28:27,287 --> 00:28:29,684
Evil Bratt was a masterpiece.

463
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:32,294
Does no one value
true art anymore?

464
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:34,467
It's a disgrace and a travesty, sir.

465
00:28:34,492 --> 00:28:38,433
Well, now that I've got the diamond,
it's payback time.

466
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:42,344
Oh, it's too bad Gru won't be
around to try and stop me.

467
00:28:42,369 --> 00:28:44,886
Oh, wait! No, it's not!
I hate that tweeb!

468
00:28:44,911 --> 00:28:46,815
And you, Hollywood!

469
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,049
This time, I'm canceling you!

470
00:28:50,074 --> 00:28:53,505
And all the losers
who rejected me!

471
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,872
Ha ha ha... !

472
00:28:58,624 --> 00:29:00,340
Ooooo, piggy, piggy!

473
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:03,876
So how are things
going for you, career-wise?

474
00:29:03,901 --> 00:29:05,703
Ahhaaaaa… great.

475
00:29:05,728 --> 00:29:08,709
So, so great.
Crushing it.

476
00:29:08,734 --> 00:29:15,134
Well, I've got something that I think
you will find very interesting.

477
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:19,123
Hold on to your face, Brother.

478
00:29:23,926 --> 00:29:25,231
Whaaaaaaaaaa!

479
00:29:25,256 --> 00:29:27,878
Yee-haw!
Ya ya!

480
00:29:27,903 --> 00:29:29,339
Eh.
What?

481
00:29:29,871 --> 00:29:31,134
Yee-haw!

482
00:29:36,797 --> 00:29:38,172
Ow!

483
00:29:39,474 --> 00:29:41,775
Huh? Ah!
Salami!

484
00:29:42,469 --> 00:29:44,113
Hey, I got Salami.

485
00:29:44,138 --> 00:29:45,975
Ah, yes, yes.

486
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,490
It's Salami.

487
00:29:47,843 --> 00:29:50,940
- Whoa. Whoa.
- Come on, come on.

488
00:29:52,908 --> 00:29:55,060
What is all this?

489
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:59,829
The pig farm was just a cover
for the real family business.

490
00:30:01,772 --> 00:30:03,146
Haha!
Hey.

491
00:30:04,171 --> 00:30:06,068
It's Gru with boobs!

492
00:30:07,102 --> 00:30:11,112
Now, feast your eyes on…

493
00:30:11,137 --> 00:30:16,509
Dad's lair!
Ta-da!

494
00:30:16,534 --> 00:30:22,149
Whoa whoa whoa, wait…
So our dad was a villain?

495
00:30:22,174 --> 00:30:24,461
No, no, no.
Not just a villain.

496
00:30:24,486 --> 00:30:28,048
But one of the greatest
of all time!

497
00:30:28,073 --> 00:30:32,316
He was known
as the Bald terror.

498
00:30:32,341 --> 00:30:35,525
That's him?
Our dad?

499
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:39,657
He was so proud of you.
And what a great villain you were.

500
00:30:39,817 --> 00:30:41,176
He was?

501
00:30:41,201 --> 00:30:44,523
But me…
not so much

502
00:30:44,548 --> 00:30:50,048
To Dad, I was just a failure.

503
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:53,150
He never thought I had
what it took to be a villain.

504
00:30:53,175 --> 00:30:57,018
But now you can help me
prove him wrong.

505
00:30:57,043 --> 00:31:01,834
Brother, teach me the art of villainy!

506
00:31:03,315 --> 00:31:06,549
No. No, no, no.
I can't do that.

507
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:11,517
What? But it's our family tradition!
You can't say no to that!

508
00:31:11,542 --> 00:31:15,069
Look, I'm sorry.
I've left that life behind me.

509
00:31:15,094 --> 00:31:17,567
- End of story.
- Oh.

510
00:31:18,407 --> 00:31:20,873
Okay.
I understand.

511
00:31:20,898 --> 00:31:23,625
Hmmm…
I wonder what this does?

512
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:25,088
Huh?

513
00:31:25,113 --> 00:31:26,245
Help.
Help!

514
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,414
No no no...

515
00:31:27,446 --> 00:31:30,268
- Aaah!
- Aah!

516
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,420
Holey moley!

517
00:31:41,444 --> 00:31:46,396
Dad's villain wheels.
Pretty slick, huh?

518
00:31:46,421 --> 00:31:48,820
Hey, you want to
take her out for a spin?

519
00:31:48,845 --> 00:31:50,927
Just for some fun?

520
00:31:51,848 --> 00:31:54,091
Hmmmmm…

521
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:58,152
Woo-hoo!

522
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,785
Look out!
Whoa! Whoa!

523
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:03,236
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

524
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,053
What a beautiful day!

525
00:32:06,078 --> 00:32:10,529
Zero to 400 in 3 seconds.
Able to withstand a nuclear blast,

526
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:12,737
armed to the teeth!

527
00:32:14,086 --> 00:32:16,414
Oh yeah.
That's pretty nice.

528
00:32:16,448 --> 00:32:20,046
- And it's a hybrid.
- LOOK OUT!

529
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:44,051
Yeah!
Help me!

530
00:32:45,843 --> 00:32:50,082
I am not enjoying this...!

531
00:32:58,719 --> 00:33:00,912
Whoa.
What is going on here?

532
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:04,856
Welcome to the annual
Freedonian Cheese Festival!

533
00:33:04,881 --> 00:33:06,057
Go!

534
00:33:10,499 --> 00:33:14,211
Ooo. Look. Look.
Look at all the candies.

535
00:33:14,527 --> 00:33:16,153
Whoa!

536
00:33:16,944 --> 00:33:19,619
Lucy, can we get these please?

537
00:33:19,644 --> 00:33:22,286
Okay, but only one each.
I mean it.

538
00:33:22,311 --> 00:33:24,355
- Awww.
- Oh, man.

539
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,738
No, I don't!
Get as many as you want,

540
00:33:26,763 --> 00:33:28,207
- I don't care!
- Yay!

541
00:33:28,232 --> 00:33:29,282
Awesome!

542
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:31,444
- Um.
- What?

543
00:33:31,469 --> 00:33:34,825
It's okay to tell them no
sometimes, too, you know.

544
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,460
Moms need to be tough.

545
00:33:36,485 --> 00:33:38,337
Right. Right, tough.
Good one.

546
00:33:38,362 --> 00:33:41,990
I can totally do that. You know,
still figuring out this mom thing.

547
00:33:42,015 --> 00:33:44,508
Getting my sea legs, matie!

548
00:33:44,861 --> 00:33:47,206
It's a unicorn!

549
00:33:51,241 --> 00:33:54,626
Can we go in there!
Please please please please please?

550
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:58,990
Um, sure…
Yeah.

551
00:33:59,015 --> 00:34:02,353
But first, let's, um…
ooh, look!

552
00:34:02,378 --> 00:34:06,959
It's a traditional Freedonian dance!
How amazing does that look?

553
00:34:09,191 --> 00:34:11,734
Chee!
I love this.

554
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:15,327
The little girls go and get
the cheese from the little boys.

555
00:34:15,352 --> 00:34:17,215
That's adorable.

556
00:34:19,319 --> 00:34:21,658
Oh, look at that
poor little guy.

557
00:34:21,683 --> 00:34:25,300
With his little boots.
Nobody picked him.

558
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,985
Margo, why don't you go up there?

559
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:30,234
- No way!
- Okay.

560
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:32,698
Wait a minute.
No.

561
00:34:32,723 --> 00:34:35,299
Go take a bite of
his cheese, young lady.

562
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:36,629
Right now.

563
00:34:36,654 --> 00:34:37,461
What?

564
00:34:37,486 --> 00:34:39,596
I'm being tougher.
You know, like you said.

565
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:42,669
No. I meant be tougher
on them, not me.

566
00:34:42,694 --> 00:34:46,148
Oh, come on, just do it.
What's the worst that could happen?

567
00:34:48,769 --> 00:34:50,324
Fine.

568
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:51,927
Huh!

569
00:34:54,364 --> 00:34:56,491
Wow!

570
00:34:56,942 --> 00:34:59,329
Hey there, I'm Margo.

571
00:34:59,354 --> 00:35:01,174
Hello, Margo.

572
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,620
I am Niko.
Would you like some of my cheese?

573
00:35:06,754 --> 00:35:07,918
Hmmm...

574
00:35:07,942 --> 00:35:11,877
Yes, yes, yes!
Thank you, Margo! Thank you!

575
00:35:13,157 --> 00:35:15,418
BAM!
I am a great mother.

576
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:18,809
Did you see that, girls?
I lay down the...

577
00:35:19,031 --> 00:35:21,611
Oh no…
Where are they?

578
00:35:21,846 --> 00:35:24,362
Agnes!
Edith!

579
00:35:26,863 --> 00:35:28,241
Hello.

580
00:35:30,357 --> 00:35:33,928
Uh, look!
A unicorn horn!

581
00:35:35,899 --> 00:35:38,664
My little brain
is going to explode!

582
00:35:38,689 --> 00:35:41,531
Ugh, Agnes.
That's a fake.

583
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:45,026
Ohhhh, it's real alright.

584
00:35:45,198 --> 00:35:48,761
That horn
came from the Crooked Forest.

585
00:35:48,786 --> 00:35:54,127
The only place on earth
where unicorns still live.

586
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,474
Laugh!
Laugh, all of you!

587
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,123
They all think I'm crazy.

588
00:36:05,148 --> 00:36:08,543
But I'm telling you,
I saw one once.

589
00:36:08,568 --> 00:36:10,485
With my own eye!

590
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:13,944
Wait, wait, wait…
You saw a for-real, live unicorn?

591
00:36:13,969 --> 00:36:15,392
What did it look like?

592
00:36:15,417 --> 00:36:17,511
Did you pet it?
Did it smell like candy?

593
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:20,576
Was it… fluffy?

594
00:36:20,601 --> 00:36:25,647
It was so fluffy
I thought I was going to die.

595
00:36:25,959 --> 00:36:28,450
Do you think maybe
I could find one, too?

596
00:36:28,694 --> 00:36:33,567
They say if a maiden pure of heart
goes into the Crooked Forest,

597
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:39,762
the unicorn will come…
and be hers forever.

598
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,713
Agnes!

599
00:36:53,057 --> 00:36:54,468
Goal!

600
00:36:54,919 --> 00:36:56,368
Excuse me!

601
00:36:56,866 --> 00:36:59,066
Girls!
Don't worry, I'm here!

602
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,676
Are you okay?

603
00:37:00,892 --> 00:37:04,095
Yeah, we're fine.
Are you?

604
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:10,460
Unicorns are really real!
And I'm gonna find one!!

605
00:37:10,485 --> 00:37:13,104
Sorry, I went a little
mama bear on you.

606
00:37:13,129 --> 00:37:15,052
You know, I heard a scream and…

607
00:37:15,077 --> 00:37:16,945
yeah, okay.
Have a good one!

608
00:37:21,346 --> 00:37:23,401
- Wait for me here!
- Don't.

609
00:37:23,426 --> 00:37:26,522
Stop that! Ow!
You kicked me.

610
00:37:27,927 --> 00:37:30,600
Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

611
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:32,889
Did you just steal candies?

612
00:37:32,914 --> 00:37:33,566
Yes!

613
00:37:33,591 --> 00:37:36,661
That was a lot of
effort for two lollipops.

614
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,077
Oh no!
The police!

615
00:37:43,102 --> 00:37:45,148
What do we do?
What do we do?

616
00:37:45,173 --> 00:37:48,507
Come on!
This is going to be fun!

617
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,930
The police are going to get us!
I'm freaking out!

618
00:38:00,955 --> 00:38:02,443
Brakes!

619
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:06,297
Cops!

620
00:38:21,706 --> 00:38:23,672
Whoa, they're back!

621
00:38:47,928 --> 00:38:50,132
Man, that was crazy!

622
00:38:50,157 --> 00:38:52,777
- We're so close to getting busted.
- Tell me about it.

623
00:38:52,802 --> 00:38:55,715
I thought you were
going to pee your pants!

624
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,643
- I did!
- You did!

625
00:39:05,211 --> 00:39:07,738
Mel, food...

626
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:11,323
Ugh. Hey, Mel.
Hold on a sec.

627
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:12,773
We're tired, cold, and hungry.

628
00:39:12,798 --> 00:39:14,807
- Mel, hungry.
- Mel, hungry.

629
00:39:15,295 --> 00:39:18,347
It's pizza. Over there.
Our food, spaghetti!

630
00:39:18,824 --> 00:39:21,781
Pizza! Pizza! Pizza!

631
00:39:23,982 --> 00:39:26,508
Pizza! Pizza! Pizza!

632
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:28,518
Hey!
What are you doing?

633
00:39:28,653 --> 00:39:31,089
Intruders!
Intruders!

634
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,373
Stop!
Hey, you! Don't move!

635
00:39:39,398 --> 00:39:40,579
Halt!

636
00:39:46,307 --> 00:39:48,087
Call for backup!

637
00:39:48,112 --> 00:39:50,988
Come on. Come on.
Let's go, keep going.

638
00:39:53,571 --> 00:39:54,792
What's this?

639
00:40:06,726 --> 00:40:09,237
Happy? It's on you.
Do something.

640
00:40:09,262 --> 00:40:12,356
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

641
00:40:51,558 --> 00:40:53,421
Get 'em!
Go! Go!

642
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,996
Hey, you!
Freeze!

643
00:41:32,021 --> 00:41:33,517
Don't move!

644
00:41:34,484 --> 00:41:36,383
Hands in the air!

645
00:41:42,746 --> 00:41:46,358
Face it, Gru.
Villainy is in your blood.

646
00:41:46,524 --> 00:41:49,509
You can't tell me you don't
miss the rush.  A little?

647
00:41:49,534 --> 00:41:52,599
Well…
Yeah, maybe a little.

648
00:41:52,624 --> 00:41:55,368
And now you've got a chance
to get back on top.

649
00:41:55,393 --> 00:41:58,214
Get your mojo back.
Become Gru again!

650
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:01,102
How awesome would that be?

651
00:42:02,734 --> 00:42:07,003
Oh please, come on,
just one heist.

652
00:42:07,015 --> 00:42:10,921
There's got to be something
out there, somewhere,

653
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:14,195
that you still want to steal.

654
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:19,402
Hmmmm…
There is something.

655
00:42:19,427 --> 00:42:25,612
How about we steal
the largest diamond in the world?

656
00:42:25,637 --> 00:42:28,414
Yes!
I love it!

657
00:42:28,775 --> 00:42:30,287
Oh, thank you, Brother!

658
00:42:30,312 --> 00:42:33,370
Thank you from the
bottom of my heart!

659
00:42:35,555 --> 00:42:38,750
Oh! You know what?
We should do something to celebrate.

660
00:42:38,775 --> 00:42:43,036
Ohhhh.
I've got the perfect idea.

661
00:42:45,691 --> 00:42:46,967
Fritz, my good fellow.

662
00:42:46,992 --> 00:42:48,777
Could you get me
another napkin, please?

663
00:42:48,802 --> 00:42:51,267
Oh yes, of course, Miss Edith.

664
00:42:58,359 --> 00:42:59,944
Hey, where are Gru and Dru?

665
00:42:59,969 --> 00:43:02,326
Here we are!

666
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:04,292
How's it going?

667
00:43:05,304 --> 00:43:07,111
It's me, Gru.

668
00:43:07,136 --> 00:43:09,657
And me, Dru.

669
00:43:10,027 --> 00:43:14,111
I hug everybody whether
they like it or not.

670
00:43:14,136 --> 00:43:16,805
Why are they pretending
to be each other?

671
00:43:17,201 --> 00:43:18,264
Oh!

672
00:43:18,297 --> 00:43:21,577
What's for dinner?
I probably won't like it.

673
00:43:21,602 --> 00:43:24,492
I'm so grumpy all the time!

674
00:43:24,517 --> 00:43:26,791
Hey!
I laugh a lot!

675
00:43:26,816 --> 00:43:29,423
And I'm kind of an idiot!

676
00:43:39,076 --> 00:43:40,926
Oh, a bust in the gut.

677
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:45,113
Look at them!
They had no idea!

678
00:43:45,138 --> 00:43:46,698
Total burn.

679
00:43:46,723 --> 00:43:48,803
Oh, look,
it's me...Gru!

680
00:43:48,828 --> 00:43:52,293
And I'm Dru!
We switched places!

681
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:54,708
Awww. It's so nice to see
you two are getting along

682
00:43:54,733 --> 00:43:58,150
- Oh, we're getting...
- Along perfectly.

683
00:43:58,318 --> 00:43:59,806
- Wait. Did we...
- Just finish...

684
00:43:59,831 --> 00:44:00,828
- Each...
- Other's...

685
00:44:00,853 --> 00:44:02,301
- Sentences?
- Sentences?

686
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,857
Aw, that's delightful.
Not creepy at all.

687
00:44:05,882 --> 00:44:07,315
And you're gonna stop now,
though, right?

688
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,597
Sorry, it's a twin thing.

689
00:44:09,622 --> 00:44:11,171
Uh-huh.

690
00:44:11,196 --> 00:44:15,026
So...
what did you guys do today?

691
00:44:15,051 --> 00:44:16,836
- Nothing!
- Nothing!

692
00:44:17,164 --> 00:44:18,258
Okay.
What is it...

693
00:44:18,283 --> 00:44:19,647
All done!

694
00:44:20,152 --> 00:44:21,066
Pardon me!

695
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:23,048
Out of the way!
Good night, everybody!

696
00:44:23,073 --> 00:44:25,623
Hey, hey, hey, put the brakes on.
What's the rush?

697
00:44:25,648 --> 00:44:28,431
I need to go to bed so I can
wake up and find a unicorn!

698
00:44:28,456 --> 00:44:30,037
Good night!

699
00:44:31,573 --> 00:44:33,028
What was that about?

700
00:44:33,053 --> 00:44:36,929
Agnes thinks she's going to find
a real unicorn in the woods tomorrow.

701
00:44:36,954 --> 00:44:39,114
She's totally freaking out.

702
00:44:39,139 --> 00:44:41,511
I feel like someone got's to
tell her the truth.…

703
00:44:41,536 --> 00:44:42,756
Not it!

704
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:44,476
Ohhh, don't worry.

705
00:44:44,501 --> 00:44:47,560
Parenting 101.
I've got this.

706
00:44:49,304 --> 00:44:52,588
Ummm… And please bless that
when I find the unicorn,

707
00:44:52,613 --> 00:44:55,634
he'll want to come home with me.
And sleep in my room.

708
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:58,907
And that I can ride him
to school every day.

709
00:44:58,932 --> 00:45:02,606
And he will use his magical powers
to help me do math.

710
00:45:02,631 --> 00:45:03,951
Amen.

711
00:45:06,297 --> 00:45:08,174
Oh.
Hi, Gru.

712
00:45:08,713 --> 00:45:12,720
Hey.
So… big day tomorrow.

713
00:45:12,745 --> 00:45:15,388
Yeah, I'm finally going to
get to see a unicorn!

714
00:45:15,413 --> 00:45:16,932
For reals.

715
00:45:17,245 --> 00:45:20,300
If I do, can I bring it home,
please?

716
00:45:20,325 --> 00:45:22,431
Ohhh.
Yeah, sure.

717
00:45:22,456 --> 00:45:25,294
Tell you what,
every unicorn you find,

718
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:27,074
you can bring it home.

719
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:30,357
I'd better build a big pen, right?

720
00:45:30,977 --> 00:45:33,379
But you know…

721
00:45:33,504 --> 00:45:37,117
there's a chance that
you might not find one.

722
00:45:37,681 --> 00:45:38,994
Huh?

723
00:45:39,659 --> 00:45:40,839
I'm...

724
00:45:40,864 --> 00:45:45,458
It might not be good
unicorn finding weather.

725
00:45:46,814 --> 00:45:47,976
Umm.

726
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:51,349
They're tricky to find them…

727
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:53,335
and I don't know…

728
00:45:53,360 --> 00:46:02,651
Maybe, just...
maybe unicorns don't really ex...

729
00:46:03,131 --> 00:46:08,022
...explore that part of the woods.

730
00:46:10,137 --> 00:46:12,424
But the man said

731
00:46:12,449 --> 00:46:15,622
a maiden could find one
if she was pure of heart.

732
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:18,428
And I'm pure of heart, right?

733
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,994
The purest.

734
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:28,519
Can we stop talking now?
I need to get to sleep.

735
00:46:28,544 --> 00:46:30,164
Goodnight, sweetie.

736
00:46:30,189 --> 00:46:32,077
Goodnight, Gru.

737
00:46:32,871 --> 00:46:38,521
Unicorns I love them.
Unicorns I love them.

738
00:46:38,711 --> 00:46:40,810
Huh!
Aaaah!

739
00:46:42,413 --> 00:46:44,105
I'm okay.

740
00:46:51,136 --> 00:46:52,255
Uh.

741
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,228
Hey!
Give that back!

742
00:46:54,253 --> 00:46:55,621
Huh?
Come on!

743
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,965
Guys!
Don't leave me!

744
00:46:58,943 --> 00:47:01,057
Oh, no!
Run!

745
00:47:26,397 --> 00:47:28,704
We've been waiting a long time.

746
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:30,570
No. No.
Ow!

747
00:47:30,595 --> 00:47:32,067
No.
Please, don't.

748
00:47:32,092 --> 00:47:33,267
Huh!

749
00:47:33,883 --> 00:47:35,382
Gru?

750
00:47:57,643 --> 00:48:00,502
My plane... broke.

751
00:48:09,059 --> 00:48:10,430
Oh.

752
00:48:11,929 --> 00:48:13,188
Uh?

753
00:48:13,213 --> 00:48:14,475
Huh!

754
00:48:24,462 --> 00:48:26,102
Buddies, I've decided.

755
00:48:26,127 --> 00:48:30,556
We're going back to Gru.
We're going back to Gru!

756
00:48:35,492 --> 00:48:39,265
Because I'm training for
the big day,

757
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:42,016
nobody's gonna stop me

758
00:48:42,041 --> 00:48:47,653
'cause I am super sassy.
Super sassy. Super sassy.

759
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,816
What's today's plan, boss?

760
00:48:49,841 --> 00:48:51,512
What's the plan?

761
00:48:51,537 --> 00:48:53,791
Silly robot.
I'll show you the plan.

762
00:48:53,816 --> 00:48:56,896
Time to watch a very
special episode of Evil Bratt

763
00:48:56,921 --> 00:49:00,830
to see exactly what I'm going
to do to stupid Tinseltown.

764
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,245
This week on Evil Bratt.

765
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:12,004
It's a giant Evil Bratt robot!
Open fire!

766
00:49:16,516 --> 00:49:20,073
Nice try, coppers.
Chew on this!

767
00:49:22,356 --> 00:49:26,523
He's shooting his super sticky
self inflating gum!

768
00:49:26,898 --> 00:49:28,531
Run!

769
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,559
Gum one!
Gum all!

770
00:49:33,451 --> 00:49:34,787
Gum one.
Gum all.

771
00:49:34,812 --> 00:49:38,451
Seriously, how did this show
never win an Emmy?

772
00:49:40,629 --> 00:49:45,242
And now, it's your turn
to shine, my diamond!

773
00:49:56,471 --> 00:49:57,463
Hey, Clive.

774
00:49:57,488 --> 00:50:01,870
I guess you can say our plan
was... out of this world.

775
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:07,995
Now that's entertainment.

776
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,953
Come on.
Let's make it a reality.

777
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:18,783
Here we are, in the dark
and creepy Crooked Forest,

778
00:50:18,808 --> 00:50:21,016
in search of the
mythical unicorn.

779
00:50:21,041 --> 00:50:22,519
For some reason.

780
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:25,939
And here she is,
the fearless unicorn hunter, seeking the...

781
00:50:25,964 --> 00:50:27,372
Edith, stop it!

782
00:50:27,397 --> 00:50:29,606
You're gonna scare away the unicorn!

783
00:50:29,631 --> 00:50:32,061
If somehow we actually
find a unicorn,

784
00:50:32,086 --> 00:50:34,044
I'm gonna film it
and get rich.

785
00:50:34,069 --> 00:50:35,948
Look over there!

786
00:50:36,194 --> 00:50:38,067
Wooah!

787
00:50:38,451 --> 00:50:41,168
This is it!
This is where we're gonna see it!

788
00:50:41,637 --> 00:50:44,642
Unicorns, here we come.

789
00:50:44,829 --> 00:50:45,795
What's that for?

790
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:47,818
Bait.
Duh.

791
00:50:47,843 --> 00:50:49,281
Come on!

792
00:50:51,353 --> 00:50:53,919
Now all we have
to do is wait.

793
00:50:57,696 --> 00:50:59,420
Okay.
This is Bratt's lair.

794
00:50:59,445 --> 00:51:01,501
It may not look like much,
but this place is armed

795
00:51:01,526 --> 00:51:04,673
with some of the most high-tech
weaponry known to man.

796
00:51:04,698 --> 00:51:06,860
It's considered impenetrable.

797
00:51:06,885 --> 00:51:09,926
But a piece of cake for us,
right, Brother?

798
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:14,201
This is not like stealing lollipops.

799
00:51:15,303 --> 00:51:17,303
Whoa!

800
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:23,895
This security system can detect
an air assault from any direction.

801
00:51:25,352 --> 00:51:26,923
No!
Ouch!

802
00:51:26,948 --> 00:51:28,509
No!
Ouch!

803
00:51:28,534 --> 00:51:31,224
Please! Stop!
Ouch!

804
00:51:32,284 --> 00:51:35,890
So we'll have to approach low
and close to the water.

805
00:51:35,915 --> 00:51:37,094
Next.

806
00:51:38,689 --> 00:51:40,990
Then there are these deadly spikes.

807
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:44,005
Ha ha ha ha!
Geronimo!

808
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:48,730
Covered with enough poison
to blow your mind... literally.

809
00:51:48,755 --> 00:51:50,750
Ouch!
Ha ha ha ha ha!

810
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:52,223
Ah...
Good to know.

811
00:51:52,248 --> 00:51:53,462
So here's the plan.

812
00:51:53,487 --> 00:51:56,514
You're the getaway driver.

813
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:58,054
So you'll wait in the boat.

814
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,261
Wait, hold on.
Wait in the boat?

815
00:52:00,286 --> 00:52:03,930
But... I want to be
in on the actions!

816
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:08,542
The getaway driver is the
most crucial part of any plan.

817
00:52:08,567 --> 00:52:13,123
Do you know how hard it is
doing nothing, touching nothing,

818
00:52:13,148 --> 00:52:16,214
with all of the adrenaline
coursing through your veins…

819
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:17,953
and you must wait.

820
00:52:17,978 --> 00:52:19,943
Can I count on you?

821
00:52:20,944 --> 00:52:22,766
I guess so…

822
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:26,588
So... I'll climb up the cube
and enter here.

823
00:52:26,613 --> 00:52:29,210
Then once I'm inside,
I'll find the diamond.

824
00:52:29,235 --> 00:52:33,334
I've underestimated Bratt before.
It's not going to be easy.

825
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,034
I think we can handle it.

826
00:52:38,107 --> 00:52:41,901
Dad's villain suits!
This will make us unstoppable.

827
00:52:41,926 --> 00:52:44,188
Whoa.
Ay, chihuahua!

828
00:52:44,213 --> 00:52:45,968
I call the black one!

829
00:52:48,396 --> 00:52:51,123
It's go time!

830
00:53:01,025 --> 00:53:03,580
Hello.
Oh, hi.

831
00:53:03,605 --> 00:53:06,696
Hello, mother of Margo.
I am Niko.

832
00:53:06,721 --> 00:53:11,615
I present you with pig to confirm
my engagement to your daughter.

833
00:53:14,121 --> 00:53:15,637
- Hey, what now?
- What's going on?

834
00:53:15,662 --> 00:53:17,130
Remember, little boots?

835
00:53:17,155 --> 00:53:20,556
- Hello, my schmoopsie poo.
- Whoa! Hey!

836
00:53:20,581 --> 00:53:22,967
He seems to think you're engaged.

837
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,802
What?
We're not engaged!

838
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:28,884
Look, Niko.
You seem like a very nice boy

839
00:53:28,909 --> 00:53:30,431
With a very nice pig.

840
00:53:30,456 --> 00:53:32,802
Uh, but you're not engaged.

841
00:53:33,464 --> 00:53:35,994
Okay?
It's not happening.

842
00:53:36,006 --> 00:53:39,043
I understand.
Who was I kidding?

843
00:53:39,068 --> 00:53:43,124
A dumpling like me with
a goddess like you?

844
00:53:43,149 --> 00:53:47,493
But I promise:
I will never forget you, Margo.

845
00:53:47,518 --> 00:53:48,960
Never.

846
00:53:50,284 --> 00:53:52,956
Oh, I'm pretty sure
I won't forget you, either.

847
00:53:52,981 --> 00:53:55,293
Bye.
Bye, Niko.

848
00:53:55,318 --> 00:53:57,800
Wow, that was crazy!
Wooo!

849
00:53:57,825 --> 00:54:00,039
That was totally humiliating!

850
00:54:00,064 --> 00:54:03,282
Taking a bite of that cheese was
the stupidest thing I've ever done.

851
00:54:03,307 --> 00:54:04,702
Why did I listen to you?

852
00:54:04,727 --> 00:54:07,119
Right, but it's over now, so...

853
00:54:07,144 --> 00:54:09,933
Ugh, here we go.
Niko...

854
00:54:10,604 --> 00:54:14,243
You!
You refuse my son's engagement pig?

855
00:54:14,268 --> 00:54:14,871
What?

856
00:54:14,896 --> 00:54:20,125
May you and your daughter die
a slow death and be buried with onions!

857
00:54:22,179 --> 00:54:23,885
Alright, lady.
That's it!

858
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:29,312
Nobody... nobody! ...curses my daughter!
You got that?

859
00:54:29,337 --> 00:54:32,293
Because if you mess with Margo,
you mess with me!

860
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:36,759
And I promise, you do not
want to mess with me!

861
00:54:36,771 --> 00:54:39,108
Do you understand me?

862
00:54:39,133 --> 00:54:40,245
Yes, yes.

863
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:43,174
Good.
Now, GET!

864
00:54:46,429 --> 00:54:49,350
Look, Margo.
I think we just need to... Oh.

865
00:54:52,846 --> 00:54:54,142
Yes!

866
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:56,554
Oh!
I've to tell Gru!

867
00:55:12,402 --> 00:55:15,068
- Can we go back now?
- Already?

868
00:55:15,093 --> 00:55:16,797
Just a couple more hours!

869
00:55:16,822 --> 00:55:19,307
We have to be home
before it gets dark.

870
00:55:20,171 --> 00:55:22,177
I don't understand.

871
00:55:22,202 --> 00:55:24,520
I did exactly
what the man said.

872
00:55:24,545 --> 00:55:27,967
You mean that one-eyed, scar-faced man
that everybody laughed at?

873
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:30,189
Yeah.
It makes no sense.

874
00:55:30,214 --> 00:55:32,901
- Look, Agnes, maybe we're not...
- Huh!

875
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:47,644
My whole life has been
building to this moment!

876
00:55:53,497 --> 00:55:54,727
Um.
It's a...

877
00:55:54,752 --> 00:55:56,561
Unicorn!

878
00:55:58,394 --> 00:56:00,512
I can't believe it!

879
00:56:00,937 --> 00:56:03,529
I'm gonna name you Lucky!

880
00:56:03,718 --> 00:56:06,856
Oh, Lucky, stop it...

881
00:56:07,903 --> 00:56:10,860
Yeah.
I'll let someone else burst her bubble.

882
00:56:17,392 --> 00:56:21,122
Look at us!
Two brothers pulling a heist.

883
00:56:21,147 --> 00:56:26,765
And that diamond will make us
the richest, most powerful villains in the world!

884
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:28,297
Right, Brother?

885
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:32,457
Right.
Yeah. Yeah...

886
00:56:34,355 --> 00:56:38,232
Bravo! Bravissimo!
You're amazing!

887
00:56:38,257 --> 00:56:40,652
I'm so sorry. I'm so embarrassed.
I was very rude.

888
00:56:40,677 --> 00:56:42,886
- And you were always such a gentleman.
- You did it! You did it!

889
00:56:42,911 --> 00:56:44,816
You got our jobs back.

890
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:53,407
What? Oh yeah.
Right. Sure.

891
00:56:53,432 --> 00:56:55,215
Oh look, we're here!

892
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:20,000
https://t.me/RickyChannel

893
00:57:02,107 --> 00:57:04,536
I'm going in.
Take the wheel.

894
00:57:04,561 --> 00:57:07,123
I still don't see
why I can't go with you.

895
00:57:07,148 --> 00:57:08,677
Hey.
Hey, we discussed this.

896
00:57:08,702 --> 00:57:11,156
Now is not the time
to mess with the plan.

897
00:57:11,181 --> 00:57:12,968
Fine...

898
00:57:26,203 --> 00:57:27,994
- Hey, brother.
- What?

899
00:57:28,019 --> 00:57:30,758
I told you, you were
supposed to stay with the boat!

900
00:57:30,783 --> 00:57:33,678
Oh, I didn't think
you meant that literally.

901
00:57:33,703 --> 00:57:36,122
What other way
could I have meant it?

902
00:57:36,727 --> 00:57:40,003
Alright. Let's move.
Just follow my lead.

903
00:57:41,028 --> 00:57:42,575
Got it.

904
00:57:45,974 --> 00:57:48,140
Help me!
Ow! Ow! Ow!

905
00:57:48,165 --> 00:57:50,185
Oh no!
The poison spikes!

906
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:52,873
Oh, I'm gonna be impaled!

907
00:57:54,749 --> 00:57:57,084
Ha ha!
I'm okay!

908
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:59,221
I miss the Minions.

909
00:57:59,246 --> 00:58:00,565
Come on!

910
00:58:06,561 --> 00:58:08,142
Coming.

911
00:58:13,868 --> 00:58:15,371
Coming.

912
00:58:19,836 --> 00:58:21,233
Come on.

913
00:58:26,801 --> 00:58:28,508
It's a scanning device!

914
00:58:28,533 --> 00:58:30,653
Quick... camouflage mode.

915
00:58:31,023 --> 00:58:33,000
Freeze!
And close your eyes.

916
00:58:33,025 --> 00:58:34,837
And cover your mouth!

917
00:58:40,603 --> 00:58:42,603
Okay.
Take my hand!

918
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:08,635
Ha ha.
Follow me!

919
00:59:25,227 --> 00:59:26,522
Ha ha.

920
00:59:31,727 --> 00:59:33,552
Look out!

921
00:59:37,426 --> 00:59:40,725
You're right.
I should've stay in the boat.

922
00:59:40,779 --> 00:59:43,597
My stomach feels all queasy.

923
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:47,461
I shouldn't have eaten
that hot pie.

924
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:50,354
Hey. Hey.
Relax.

925
00:59:50,379 --> 00:59:54,220
You're going to be just fine.
I got your back.

926
01:00:00,378 --> 01:00:02,145
Come on, this way.

927
01:00:04,093 --> 01:00:05,982
Gru would take this.
Gru would take that.

928
01:00:06,007 --> 01:00:07,595
Go, go, go!

929
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:09,367
Eh.
Peter, that way.

930
01:00:09,392 --> 01:00:11,055
Oh, okay, okay.

931
01:00:32,334 --> 01:00:34,012
Go, go.
Go, go, go!

932
01:00:46,787 --> 01:00:48,684
Huh?
Hey, come back.

933
01:00:58,743 --> 01:01:02,037
Hello. Hello.
Hello.

934
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,605
You jacket is located
within easy reach.

935
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:13,551
Inflate your jacket by pulling the toggle.
Like this...

936
01:01:13,583 --> 01:01:15,884
Thank for your attention,
enjoy your flight.

937
01:01:21,564 --> 01:01:25,430
Straight ahead. Straight ahead.
Straight ahead.

938
01:01:26,938 --> 01:01:29,477
Bud-Buddy.
Bud-Buddy!

939
01:01:30,091 --> 01:01:33,116
Buddy!!!

940
01:01:33,555 --> 01:01:35,301
It looks like
it's right above us.

941
01:01:35,326 --> 01:01:37,901
Okay! What do I do?
Should I wait in the vent?

942
01:01:37,926 --> 01:01:39,699
No.
Come with me.

943
01:01:54,963 --> 01:01:57,482
Yes, I'd like to
thank the Academy.

944
01:01:59,717 --> 01:02:01,313
- I can...
- No no no no no...

945
01:02:01,338 --> 01:02:03,781
- Why? I can do it.
- Don't, don't, don't!

946
01:02:03,806 --> 01:02:06,950
Yes, yes, Molly Ringwald.
I will take you to the prom.

947
01:02:06,975 --> 01:02:08,810
What... Who…
Where... What...

948
01:02:08,835 --> 01:02:10,543
Who's there…?
Who's there…?

949
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,546
Ninety nine red balloons...

950
01:02:20,571 --> 01:02:22,399
Whoops!
Almost forgot.

951
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:35,310
Shhh, shhh.
Over here!

952
01:02:36,927 --> 01:02:38,465
Stay close!

953
01:02:40,023 --> 01:02:42,882
Huh!
Whaaa...

954
01:02:42,907 --> 01:02:44,204
Dolls.

955
01:02:44,229 --> 01:02:48,088
Looks like Bratt was the only one
stupid enough to buy this junk.

956
01:02:48,113 --> 01:02:51,237
Oh.
I used to have one of these!

957
01:02:51,262 --> 01:02:53,607
Pew pew pew!

958
01:02:53,632 --> 01:02:56,499
Aaah!
Oww!

959
01:02:56,524 --> 01:02:58,743
Hey! Shh!
Come on!

960
01:03:06,299 --> 01:03:09,329
Alright.
We're getting close.

961
01:03:09,354 --> 01:03:13,744
From now on, every move must be
made with ultra precision and purpose.

962
01:03:15,523 --> 01:03:16,763
Gum!

963
01:03:16,788 --> 01:03:18,196
Focus!

964
01:03:18,221 --> 01:03:20,820
We're after the diamond,
not the bubble gum!

965
01:03:20,845 --> 01:03:22,510
Ah, got it.

966
01:03:24,821 --> 01:03:26,802
Mmm.
Yum.

967
01:03:27,809 --> 01:03:29,275
This way!

968
01:03:29,884 --> 01:03:33,191
And now to put this
where it belongs.

969
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:35,183
What?

970
01:03:35,208 --> 01:03:38,822
Look at it, Clive.
It's beautiful!

971
01:03:44,685 --> 01:03:47,651
Will you please shut up?
He's gonna spot us.

972
01:03:49,821 --> 01:03:53,281
Spit it out! Spit it out!
I told you not to touch anything!

973
01:03:56,372 --> 01:03:59,709
Intruders! Intruders!
Intruders!

974
01:04:01,609 --> 01:04:03,712
Freeze, dipsticks!

975
01:04:03,737 --> 01:04:06,288
Gru!
There's two of you now?

976
01:04:06,313 --> 01:04:09,064
Then this will be
twice as much fun.

977
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:18,007
Aaaaah!
Give me back my diamond!

978
01:04:18,032 --> 01:04:20,000
Total lockdown!!

979
01:04:20,025 --> 01:04:22,187
Go get 'em, Bratt Pack!!

980
01:04:30,475 --> 01:04:33,567
They're gonna get us!
They're gonna get us!

981
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,662
Run!

982
01:04:46,570 --> 01:04:47,829
Oh no…

983
01:04:47,854 --> 01:04:50,417
Oh no?
What does that mean?

984
01:04:50,442 --> 01:04:53,550
ARE WE GONNA DIE??
ARE WE GONNA DIE??

985
01:04:53,575 --> 01:04:55,465
WE'RE GONNA DIE!!

986
01:05:04,853 --> 01:05:06,072
What?

987
01:05:07,559 --> 01:05:09,782
Hey, guys.
Hold on!

988
01:05:09,807 --> 01:05:11,714
Lucy!

989
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:21,191
Thank you for saving us!
Woo!

990
01:05:21,216 --> 01:05:23,733
“Look! We got the diamond!
And we're going to...

991
01:05:23,758 --> 01:05:27,475
Take it to the AVL
and get our jobs back!

992
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:28,278
Wait!

993
01:05:28,303 --> 01:05:29,896
What?
That's amazing!

994
01:05:29,921 --> 01:05:33,106
And the best part is
you are never ever

995
01:05:33,131 --> 01:05:37,009
go behind my back
ever again!

996
01:05:37,034 --> 01:05:40,032
- Right, honeybear?
- Yup! Yup! Right.

997
01:05:40,057 --> 01:05:41,777
Lesson learned.

998
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:57,362
I'll get the girls and start packing
and tell them the good news!

999
01:05:57,387 --> 01:05:59,576
Ah, we're getting
our jobs back, yeah!

1000
01:05:59,601 --> 01:06:02,078
Yes. Yes.
Go tell the girls.

1001
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:03,941
Dru.

1002
01:06:03,966 --> 01:06:07,055
No. No way!
We can't give the diamond back!

1003
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,589
- I have to.
- No, you don't!

1004
01:06:09,614 --> 01:06:11,625
- Yes, I do.
- Give it.

1005
01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:13,023
- No!
- Give it!

1006
01:06:13,048 --> 01:06:14,940
Ow!
What is wrong with you?

1007
01:06:14,965 --> 01:06:16,267
What is wrong with you?

1008
01:06:16,292 --> 01:06:17,228
You kicked me!

1009
01:06:17,253 --> 01:06:18,669
You-You lied to me.

1010
01:06:18,694 --> 01:06:20,632
Hey.
I would have told you the truth.

1011
01:06:20,657 --> 01:06:23,579
But you're too much
of a wimp to handle it.

1012
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:25,094
That's it, I'm out of here.

1013
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:28,110
You have no right to take that,
we stole it together.

1014
01:06:28,135 --> 01:06:29,727
Together?

1015
01:06:30,137 --> 01:06:31,454
You got to be kidding me.

1016
01:06:31,479 --> 01:06:33,697
You did nothing but
screwed up the whole time.

1017
01:06:33,722 --> 01:06:35,457
I got this
in spite of you.

1018
01:06:35,482 --> 01:06:38,471
Oh, yeah?
Well, at least I didn't get fired

1019
01:06:38,496 --> 01:06:40,858
from my job
like a total loser.

1020
01:06:40,883 --> 01:06:42,568
At least I had a job.

1021
01:06:42,593 --> 01:06:44,665
What have you accomplished
that was so great?

1022
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:47,870
I'll tell you what:
Nothing!

1023
01:06:48,092 --> 01:06:51,653
No wonder Dad thought
you were such a failure.

1024
01:06:53,415 --> 01:06:55,336
We're no longer brothers!

1025
01:06:55,361 --> 01:06:57,229
That's fine with me!

1026
01:07:39,623 --> 01:07:43,368
Gru!
I found a unicorn!

1027
01:07:45,225 --> 01:07:47,381
My life is complete!

1028
01:07:49,714 --> 01:07:54,370
Honey, that's...
that's not actually a unicorn.

1029
01:07:54,395 --> 01:07:55,606
Huh?

1030
01:07:56,045 --> 01:07:59,696
But-But he has one horn.

1031
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:02,899
I'm-I'm sorry, sweetie,
but...

1032
01:08:02,924 --> 01:08:05,738
he's just a goat.

1033
01:08:05,763 --> 01:08:08,878
Life is just like that sometimes.

1034
01:08:08,903 --> 01:08:11,335
We're hoping for a unicorn

1035
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,622
and we get a goat.

1036
01:08:15,434 --> 01:08:17,568
Well, you know what?

1037
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:21,683
Lucky is the best goat
in the whole wide world!

1038
01:08:21,708 --> 01:08:26,021
Look at that face!
I just want to squeeze it.

1039
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:32,020
I'll take this.

1040
01:08:32,045 --> 01:08:35,140
You've been a bad boy, Gru.

1041
01:08:35,165 --> 01:08:37,180
Can you get the rest
of the suitcases?

1042
01:08:37,205 --> 01:08:39,012
Come on, girls, let's go!

1043
01:08:39,037 --> 01:08:43,139
Let's get physical, physical!

1044
01:08:49,755 --> 01:08:51,851
Change of plan, girls.

1045
01:08:51,876 --> 01:08:54,036
Instead of going home...

1046
01:08:54,061 --> 01:08:56,232
Eyebrows.
Ow!

1047
01:08:56,364 --> 01:08:59,573
We're going to Hollywood!

1048
01:09:00,656 --> 01:09:03,678
Now that's what I call acting.

1049
01:09:04,249 --> 01:09:07,973
Let's go, Clive.
We've got a giant robot waiting.

1050
01:09:10,824 --> 01:09:11,956
Huh?

1051
01:09:12,812 --> 01:09:15,087
Huh?
Lucy?

1052
01:09:16,418 --> 01:09:18,142
Bratt, he took the girls!

1053
01:09:18,167 --> 01:09:20,630
What?
No!

1054
01:09:22,919 --> 01:09:24,850
Dru!
Dru!

1055
01:09:24,864 --> 01:09:27,586
Go away.
I don't want to talk to you.

1056
01:09:27,611 --> 01:09:30,237
Bratt has the girls!

1057
01:09:37,321 --> 01:09:39,292
Listen, brother.
What...

1058
01:09:39,332 --> 01:09:41,589
- About what I said.
- No, I'm the one...

1059
01:09:41,614 --> 01:09:43,379
But I shouldn't have...

1060
01:09:43,404 --> 01:09:45,689
I'm-I'm sorry.

1061
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:49,065
I'm so sorry, Gru.

1062
01:09:49,090 --> 01:09:50,933
Awww.

1063
01:09:51,282 --> 01:09:52,946
Oh, look out!

1064
01:09:52,971 --> 01:09:54,568
What is that?

1065
01:09:54,877 --> 01:09:57,272
Hey. Hey!
Infront!

1066
01:09:58,329 --> 01:10:00,122
Caramba!
Caramba!

1067
01:10:00,147 --> 01:10:02,803
CARAMBAAAAA!

1068
01:10:02,828 --> 01:10:04,016
Mel?

1069
01:10:04,041 --> 01:10:05,780
Huh?
Gru?

1070
01:10:07,132 --> 01:10:09,681
Got to turn this thing around...

1071
01:10:10,311 --> 01:10:11,390
Gru!

1072
01:10:11,415 --> 01:10:15,939
Wait up!
GRUUUUU...

1073
01:10:39,818 --> 01:10:43,252
Hello, Hollywood!

1074
01:10:43,277 --> 01:10:46,512
I'm back and bigger than ever.

1075
01:10:48,021 --> 01:10:49,570
I'm scared!

1076
01:10:49,595 --> 01:10:52,327
Thank you.
Thank you so...

1077
01:10:57,877 --> 01:11:01,307
You can't leave me here!
I'm famous!

1078
01:11:01,844 --> 01:11:04,547
Clive, arm the cannons.

1079
01:11:06,644 --> 01:11:09,339
Chew on this!

1080
01:11:25,815 --> 01:11:28,453
Hey, mullet-head.
Let us out!

1081
01:11:28,478 --> 01:11:30,477
Oh, don't worry, girls.

1082
01:11:30,502 --> 01:11:34,071
I've prepared
a front row seat for you.

1083
01:11:49,811 --> 01:11:51,924
- Waaah!
- Agnes!

1084
01:11:52,983 --> 01:11:56,636
Once again, I win
and Gru loses.

1085
01:11:56,661 --> 01:11:59,094
Enjoy the show, girls.

1086
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:08,080
- What in the heck?
- Oh!

1087
01:12:08,105 --> 01:12:09,946
I hope the girls are okay.

1088
01:12:09,971 --> 01:12:10,986
Bratt!
Brother!

1089
01:12:11,011 --> 01:12:13,262
9 o'clock.
No. 3 o'clock.

1090
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:14,969
He's on the left!

1091
01:12:16,724 --> 01:12:19,088
Huh, no.
I've seen this episode.

1092
01:12:19,113 --> 01:12:20,745
He's going to bubble gum
the whole city

1093
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:22,894
and send it up into space.

1094
01:12:22,919 --> 01:12:24,502
Hurry!

1095
01:12:35,094 --> 01:12:37,032
This is it.
This is it.

1096
01:12:37,057 --> 01:12:39,562
Lights!
Camera!

1097
01:12:39,587 --> 01:12:41,390
LASER!

1098
01:12:51,348 --> 01:12:53,065
Yeah.

1099
01:12:58,978 --> 01:13:00,625
Look.
I got the girls.

1100
01:13:00,650 --> 01:13:01,998
You two go
take care of Bratt.

1101
01:13:02,023 --> 01:13:04,045
Wait.
What are you doing?

1102
01:13:09,919 --> 01:13:11,525
Look, you guys.
It's Lucy.

1103
01:13:11,550 --> 01:13:13,935
Lucy, over here.
Help! Help us!

1104
01:13:13,967 --> 01:13:15,769
Mama's coming, girls.

1105
01:13:15,794 --> 01:13:18,112
- Lucy!
- Right here! Lucy!

1106
01:13:18,241 --> 01:13:19,795
Look at that laser go.

1107
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:22,124
I love it when a
plan comes together.

1108
01:13:22,149 --> 01:13:24,920
Aaaah!
It's Gru!

1109
01:13:26,992 --> 01:13:28,376
Get ready, Bratt.

1110
01:13:28,401 --> 01:13:31,716
You're about to be blasted
back to the 80s.

1111
01:13:43,096 --> 01:13:46,230
Ah ho!
We got him!

1112
01:13:54,475 --> 01:13:55,825
- Oh no.
- Don't worry.

1113
01:13:55,850 --> 01:13:57,898
There's more where that came from.

1114
01:13:57,923 --> 01:14:00,538
It'll take more than
that to stop me.

1115
01:14:00,563 --> 01:14:03,467
Bratt pack,
go get that barf bag.

1116
01:14:11,259 --> 01:14:13,515
Oh, incoming!

1117
01:14:14,501 --> 01:14:15,935
Ow. Ow. Ow.

1118
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:17,463
You, little...

1119
01:14:24,688 --> 01:14:26,540
Quick!
Jump!

1120
01:14:28,685 --> 01:14:30,063
Boners!

1121
01:14:30,083 --> 01:14:32,678
Did you see that, Clive?
All gone.

1122
01:14:32,703 --> 01:14:34,885
Bye bye, Wonder Twins.

1123
01:14:53,156 --> 01:14:54,914
Whoa!
Ooh la la!

1124
01:14:54,939 --> 01:14:57,256
Look are all those giant bubbles!

1125
01:15:02,837 --> 01:15:04,250
Help!

1126
01:15:04,327 --> 01:15:05,430
Help!

1127
01:15:05,455 --> 01:15:07,030
Hang on!

1128
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:16,983
Hang on, girls!
I got you!

1129
01:15:17,008 --> 01:15:19,890
I can't.
I'm slipping!

1130
01:15:20,909 --> 01:15:22,807
No!

1131
01:15:24,078 --> 01:15:25,408
Gotcha.

1132
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:29,038
Thank you, Lucy.

1133
01:15:29,063 --> 01:15:31,569
Let's go!
We're not safe yet!

1134
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:36,630
Minions, time to do
what we do best.

1135
01:15:36,655 --> 01:15:39,498
We will cheer for our boss.
We will fight for our boss.

1136
01:15:39,523 --> 01:15:41,278
We'll pop the bubbles!

1137
01:15:41,303 --> 01:15:42,560
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1138
01:15:42,585 --> 01:15:44,245
- Villain!
- Villain!

1139
01:15:44,270 --> 01:15:47,761
You guys too!
You guys are villains!

1140
01:16:00,227 --> 01:16:02,443
Look at what we have here.

1141
01:16:02,468 --> 01:16:07,090
Sorry, Gru.
This is going to be a total burn.

1142
01:16:11,824 --> 01:16:15,182
Oh, no. No!
No, no, no, no...

1143
01:16:19,042 --> 01:16:22,335
I've been a bad boy!

1144
01:16:29,777 --> 01:16:33,731
Nobody messes with my brother!

1145
01:16:36,525 --> 01:16:37,603
Aaaah!

1146
01:16:37,628 --> 01:16:39,250
Aaaaahh!

1147
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,054
What?
What's happening?

1148
01:16:59,756 --> 01:17:01,816
Dru!

1149
01:17:02,103 --> 01:17:03,999
Hold on!
I'm coming!

1150
01:17:08,155 --> 01:17:10,743
You've ruined everything.

1151
01:17:10,768 --> 01:17:13,255
And now, it's time to die.

1152
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,971
Any last words, Gru?

1153
01:17:16,193 --> 01:17:17,705
You know what?

1154
01:17:17,730 --> 01:17:20,449
I got two words for you.

1155
01:17:21,005 --> 01:17:22,911
Dance fight.

1156
01:17:23,539 --> 01:17:27,262
Oh, it is alright, Donkey Kong.

1157
01:17:27,287 --> 01:17:30,427
I'm going to enjoy this.

1158
01:17:49,622 --> 01:17:50,929
Enough!

1159
01:17:51,318 --> 01:17:52,751
My turn.

1160
01:18:12,565 --> 01:18:14,307
Oh oh.

1161
01:18:17,321 --> 01:18:19,207
Game over!

1162
01:18:21,584 --> 01:18:24,810
Is this what you're looking for?

1163
01:18:24,835 --> 01:18:26,226
No!

1164
01:18:26,663 --> 01:18:28,598
Ow! Ow!
Ow!

1165
01:18:35,882 --> 01:18:38,206
No... !

1166
01:18:41,354 --> 01:18:43,811
Curse you, Gru!

1167
01:18:44,258 --> 01:18:46,009
Curse you.

1168
01:18:46,034 --> 01:18:48,741
Bill, over there.
Robert, work your pick.

1169
01:18:48,766 --> 01:18:50,536
Chuck, more bashing.

1170
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:56,027
Dru.

1171
01:18:56,052 --> 01:18:57,316
Dru.

1172
01:19:04,723 --> 01:19:06,942
Hey, we did it.

1173
01:19:07,305 --> 01:19:09,805
Yes, we did, brother.

1174
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:12,149
- Gru!
- Gru!

1175
01:19:12,174 --> 01:19:13,676
Girls!

1176
01:19:27,034 --> 01:19:28,139
Gru!

1177
01:19:28,164 --> 01:19:30,722
Hey, Mel.
Welcome back.

1178
01:19:30,747 --> 01:19:31,501
Woo-hooooo!

1179
01:19:31,526 --> 01:19:34,442
- Yay!
- Yay!

1180
01:20:03,741 --> 01:20:05,508
Love you, Mom.

1181
01:20:09,932 --> 01:20:13,207
I'm a Mom.
I'm a Mom!

1182
01:20:16,099 --> 01:20:18,306
Fight!
Ha ha!

1183
01:20:23,606 --> 01:20:24,310
Ha ha ha...

1184
01:20:24,335 --> 01:20:25,832
Cheater!

1185
01:20:25,857 --> 01:20:28,439
- How do you like this, Cheater?
- No. No.

1186
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:31,553
Boys.
Time for bed.

1187
01:20:31,578 --> 01:20:33,585
We're back at work
in the morning.

1188
01:20:33,761 --> 01:20:36,882
- I'm coming, sweetie.
- Hi, Lucy.

1189
01:20:36,907 --> 01:20:38,623
See you tomorrow, brother.

1190
01:20:38,648 --> 01:20:41,904
Hey, I'm back on the job.
So no villainy tonight.

1191
01:20:41,929 --> 01:20:43,101
Huh, got it?

1192
01:20:43,126 --> 01:20:46,300
I make no promises.
Love you!

1193
01:20:46,325 --> 01:20:48,255
Uh-huh, right.

1194
01:20:48,466 --> 01:20:50,119
I love you too.

1195
01:20:50,144 --> 01:20:52,076
- Awwww.
- Awwww.

1196
01:20:52,917 --> 01:20:54,757
Alright, every...
Go. Go.

1197
01:20:54,782 --> 01:20:56,251
Go to bed.

1198
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:20,000
https://t.me/RickyChannel

1199
01:21:00,459 --> 01:21:02,502
Hey. Guys.
Come on.

1200
01:21:02,527 --> 01:21:04,218
Shhh.
Shhhh.

1201
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:21,594
What the heck is happening?

1202
01:21:21,619 --> 01:21:23,805
It's coming from outside!

1203
01:21:24,999 --> 01:21:25,553
Huh!

1204
01:21:25,578 --> 01:21:29,019
Hey, I thought we said
no more villainy!

1205
01:21:29,044 --> 01:21:30,348
Sorry, brother.

1206
01:21:30,373 --> 01:21:33,524
- Somebody's got to keep
the family tradition alive.
- Yoo-hoo.

1207
01:21:33,549 --> 01:21:34,594
Right?

1208
01:21:34,619 --> 01:21:36,822
- Yeah!
- Villain!

1209
01:21:36,847 --> 01:21:38,806
- Yeah!
- Kumbaya!

1210
01:21:44,395 --> 01:21:46,055
Let's get him.

1211
01:21:46,391 --> 01:21:48,756
Honey, he's my brother.

1212
01:21:48,781 --> 01:21:51,367
We'll give him
a 5 minute head start.
