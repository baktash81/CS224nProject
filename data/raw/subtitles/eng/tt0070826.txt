00:00:20,788 --> 00:00:24,193
english subs by defon2legs

2
00:02:27,057 --> 00:02:32,224
These last 2 days the german army has progressed
at a devastating pace despite our forceful resistance

3
00:02:32,344 --> 00:02:35,898
On the Albert Canal, the belgians have established a new defence line

4
00:02:36,018 --> 00:02:38,361
which the allied forces will reinforce shortly

5
00:02:38,684 --> 00:02:42,071
The entire world responds emotionally
to the tragic consequences

6
00:02:42,191 --> 00:02:44,960
of the surprise attack by the third reich

7
00:02:46,805 --> 00:02:49,769
The Vatican has launched an appeal

8
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:54,100
to save citizens from the devastation
caused by modern weaponry

9
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,415
<i>Le Peuple</i> has appealed
to the concience of both armies

10
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:05,704
<i>Radio Genève</i> says the dutch railroad has been paralysed by the german air force

11
00:03:05,824 --> 00:03:10,270
On the ground, the paratroopers of general Von Rumstett

12
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,564
encounter a heroic resistance
nonetheless, they advance towards the Ardennes

13
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,100
Next bulletin at 7h30

14
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:23,515
Under these circumstances
we cannot broadcast our regular show <i>Life's Pleasure</i>

15
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,964
- It's begun. They're after us
- Who?

16
00:03:28,084 --> 00:03:30,078
The germans
They're coming

17
00:03:30,198 --> 00:03:32,121
- I saw belgians
- Look who's coming

18
00:03:32,241 --> 00:03:33,234
Do you want to stay?

19
00:03:33,956 --> 00:03:34,678
Stay?

20
00:03:35,059 --> 00:03:37,133
I'm asking because of your wife

21
00:03:45,929 --> 00:03:47,690
The germans are attacking France

22
00:03:48,465 --> 00:03:49,945
I saw some belgians
They were on the run

23
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:51,988
Are we gonna have to depart?

24
00:03:53,457 --> 00:03:54,443
Why?

25
00:03:54,842 --> 00:03:55,570
To go where?

26
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,791
Missy come here

27
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:58,859
The little one

28
00:04:01,632 --> 00:04:02,693
I don't know

29
00:04:03,706 --> 00:04:05,859
Is it true the germans cut off
the hands of children?

30
00:04:06,175 --> 00:04:06,971
Don't talk nonsense

31
00:04:09,594 --> 00:04:12,446
Just the same
you should ask

32
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:17,205
I'll check the town hall

33
00:04:24,427 --> 00:04:25,871
Won't you put a shirt on?

34
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,093
You see?
Everybody's leaving

35
00:06:24,811 --> 00:06:26,645
If there's still room

36
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,839
Don't worry

37
00:06:32,084 --> 00:06:33,843
Mister mayor
Make sure I can leave

38
00:06:33,963 --> 00:06:34,565
Come with me

39
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,195
You too

40
00:06:39,528 --> 00:06:40,676
For payment...

41
00:06:40,975 --> 00:06:42,586
You can pay in the train
if they should ask you

42
00:06:44,372 --> 00:06:45,808
They say we can pay in the train

43
00:06:45,928 --> 00:06:46,901
The mayor said so

44
00:06:52,188 --> 00:06:53,587
Don't rush
We have time

45
00:06:53,707 --> 00:06:56,263
- There's still 8 seats in first class, mayor
- Fine

46
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,633
No sir, you're going to the rear
with the men

47
00:06:58,753 --> 00:06:59,688
Why?

48
00:07:01,126 --> 00:07:03,482
The passenger carriages are reserved for women, children and the elderly

49
00:07:03,602 --> 00:07:04,334
It's the law

50
00:07:04,454 --> 00:07:06,611
Look at my wife
I can't leave her like that

51
00:07:06,731 --> 00:07:08,037
Why? Are you a doctor?

52
00:07:08,157 --> 00:07:08,778
No

53
00:07:08,898 --> 00:07:10,000
Then what?

54
00:07:10,702 --> 00:07:12,368
Ms Lavoyeur what are you doing?

55
00:07:12,488 --> 00:07:13,173
I'm leaving

56
00:07:13,293 --> 00:07:14,432
You have to remain seated

57
00:07:14,552 --> 00:07:16,692
You already had serious complications
during your first delivery

58
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:17,914
***

59
00:07:18,034 --> 00:07:20,599
- Isn't it?
- Yes, i agree completely

60
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:21,975
Be reasonable, good man

61
00:07:22,095 --> 00:07:23,327
And the luggage?

62
00:07:23,624 --> 00:07:25,068
We'll find a place easily

63
00:07:25,188 --> 00:07:26,457
The last carriage

64
00:07:26,577 --> 00:07:27,827
is still empty

65
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,190
We're full!

66
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,276
No need to rush

67
00:07:56,396 --> 00:07:57,813
There's no locomotive yet

68
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,553
Pierre, I don't see a thing anymore

69
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,266
It fell underneath

70
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:08,117
What's going on?

71
00:08:08,914 --> 00:08:10,080
I lost my glasses

72
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,543
One glass is broken

73
00:08:15,219 --> 00:08:16,737
You look funny

74
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,935
They don't allow anyone anymore

75
00:08:24,055 --> 00:08:25,824
Luckily we're the last ones

76
00:08:25,944 --> 00:08:28,721
Up front, there's 30 people
in each carriage

77
00:08:34,924 --> 00:08:36,147
Where's your train going?

78
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:37,036
It's turning back

79
00:08:37,156 --> 00:08:38,702
How fortunate
So am I

80
00:08:56,045 --> 00:08:58,545
In 1914, they shot deserters

81
00:08:58,665 --> 00:09:00,545
This is 1940

82
00:09:01,086 --> 00:09:03,211
I gave myself permission

83
00:09:07,887 --> 00:09:10,100
Did you find anyone
to watch your house?

84
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:14,045
My father preferred staying

85
00:09:14,396 --> 00:09:17,118
If mother was alive
they'd both have come along

86
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:19,211
Where's your wife?

87
00:09:19,331 --> 00:09:20,211
Up front

88
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,744
You reckon I have time
to go see her?

89
00:09:22,864 --> 00:09:25,522
Sure, there's still no locomotive

90
00:09:25,642 --> 00:09:28,244
Don't go via the platform
They'll resent that

91
00:09:31,355 --> 00:09:33,244
- Please keep my place
- Don't worry

92
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,189
If you see the loc
come back

93
00:09:37,689 --> 00:09:38,800
Poor guy

94
00:09:39,522 --> 00:09:41,244
Why are you not with the women?

95
00:09:41,855 --> 00:09:43,244
I don't like women

96
00:09:54,923 --> 00:09:57,978
Daddy look!
We're in first class

97
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:58,746
Be silent

98
00:10:00,302 --> 00:10:01,024
Alright?

99
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:02,351
Yes, and you?

100
00:10:03,258 --> 00:10:04,666
I'm in the last carriage

101
00:10:11,797 --> 00:10:12,908
You need anything?

102
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:14,983
If you could find water
for our little one

103
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:16,612
I've got a thermos

104
00:10:16,732 --> 00:10:18,075
I don't want to impose

105
00:10:22,365 --> 00:10:22,865
I have to run

106
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:29,643
Take care!

107
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:21,890
Move quickly

108
00:14:25,613 --> 00:14:26,095
Go on

109
00:14:34,613 --> 00:14:35,401
Who goes there?

110
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:41,205
Nobody boards here
This is no station

111
00:14:41,325 --> 00:14:42,446
We board here

112
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:44,743
In the station, the army threw us out

113
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,453
We're fully booked

114
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,215
We're gonna be invaded

115
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:13,993
Get back

116
00:15:27,196 --> 00:15:29,548
If we don't stand up
We're gonna get trampled

117
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:30,955
Shame on you!

118
00:15:31,492 --> 00:15:32,937
Shame?
Never heard of

119
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,214
Is there room?

120
00:15:34,863 --> 00:15:35,881
We're full

121
00:15:36,753 --> 00:15:37,883
Wait! I'll open up

122
00:15:43,272 --> 00:15:44,605
What a glorious nation

123
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,161
Come on
Get in

124
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,213
That's my spot

125
00:16:31,456 --> 00:16:32,326
Pardon me

126
00:16:42,531 --> 00:16:43,382
He's thirsty

127
00:17:03,385 --> 00:17:04,700
My wife expects a baby

128
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,366
Are we going yet?

129
00:17:13,386 --> 00:17:14,219
Yes we're off chief

130
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,127
Don't know where
But we're going

131
00:18:44,855 --> 00:18:46,392
Hello, this is Charly

132
00:18:47,064 --> 00:18:49,804
I've got another extra train
Get ready in 20

133
00:19:17,429 --> 00:19:18,373
Thanks but I don't smoke

134
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,502
Quickly

135
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,497
Light the lamp

136
00:21:01,998 --> 00:21:03,424
We're not gonna stop inside are we?

137
00:21:11,512 --> 00:21:13,383
One night, I was stuck
like this in a cellar

138
00:21:13,503 --> 00:21:14,540
the entire night

139
00:21:15,373 --> 00:21:16,669
bombs falling everywhere

140
00:21:17,737 --> 00:21:19,329
Next day, nothing was left standing

141
00:21:20,403 --> 00:21:22,126
No more houses
No more people

142
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:23,255
Nothing

143
00:21:24,107 --> 00:21:25,940
Don't you have a funnier story?

144
00:21:27,356 --> 00:21:28,745
It's gonna be a fun trip

145
00:22:02,577 --> 00:22:03,206
Stay here

146
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:05,632
There's military convoys underway

147
00:22:06,038 --> 00:22:06,705
At night?

148
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,678
We'll be here
for the night

149
00:22:09,798 --> 00:22:10,326
Good

150
00:22:10,446 --> 00:22:11,956
It appears we're staying
here for the night

151
00:22:12,076 --> 00:22:13,326
The entire night?

152
00:22:35,595 --> 00:22:36,246
Alright?

153
00:22:37,058 --> 00:22:37,928
I got no water left

154
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:40,044
Gimme

155
00:23:52,171 --> 00:23:53,227
I'm thirsty

156
00:24:09,194 --> 00:24:09,935
Keep it

157
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,561
I was worried

158
00:24:24,681 --> 00:24:26,154
I had to wait
for my turn

159
00:24:26,274 --> 00:24:28,154
I broke the bottle
I'll look for another one

160
00:24:28,274 --> 00:24:29,524
Not to worry, young man

161
00:24:29,644 --> 00:24:31,319
I got plenty reserve bottles
for a whole platoon

162
00:24:32,277 --> 00:24:33,777
Are you not too uncomfortable?

163
00:24:33,897 --> 00:24:35,222
No, it's fine

164
00:24:36,497 --> 00:24:37,942
We did good in leaving

165
00:24:38,062 --> 00:24:39,349
I'm more at ease

166
00:24:39,942 --> 00:24:40,849
Good for you

167
00:24:41,368 --> 00:24:43,220
Are there people from your village
in your waggon?

168
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,516
Yes it's fine

169
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:45,831
Wait

170
00:24:46,627 --> 00:24:48,275
Apparantly
They're bombarding stations

171
00:24:48,395 --> 00:24:50,594
I'm getting comfy, if I have to die

172
00:24:50,714 --> 00:24:52,367
I'd rather die in style

173
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:53,094
Take that

174
00:24:53,964 --> 00:24:54,483
And you?

175
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,627
We got all we need

176
00:25:00,461 --> 00:25:01,609
I have to go

177
00:25:02,572 --> 00:25:04,053
See you later

178
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,604
She's gone

179
00:25:18,724 --> 00:25:20,431
They couldn't stop harassing her

180
00:25:57,838 --> 00:25:59,089
I filled it

181
00:25:59,441 --> 00:26:00,589
She's got an accent

182
00:26:00,709 --> 00:26:03,188
yes
from the Alsace

183
00:26:03,308 --> 00:26:07,022
Beware the eyes and ears
of the enemy watching

184
00:26:07,142 --> 00:26:09,466
- Leave her alone
- What's mister Family Man saying?

185
00:26:09,586 --> 00:26:11,824
He says we should leave her
For him

186
00:26:11,944 --> 00:26:14,049
Right!
She's a trophy

187
00:26:14,697 --> 00:26:15,790
Let's take a walk

188
00:26:20,234 --> 00:26:21,475
Leave her alone!

189
00:26:30,374 --> 00:26:31,745
Come and get some!

190
00:26:40,585 --> 00:26:41,215
Drop it!

191
00:26:43,808 --> 00:26:45,326
That's not funny at all

192
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:47,845
Shame on you

193
00:26:48,234 --> 00:26:50,567
If you really want to fight
Go north

194
00:26:50,917 --> 00:26:52,139
They need people over there

195
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:53,510
He's right

196
00:26:53,917 --> 00:26:55,176
If we're running away
means we're scared

197
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:59,176
If we're scared
We're not fighting

198
00:27:11,236 --> 00:27:15,245
You were right in not fighting
He'd slit you open

199
00:27:34,663 --> 00:27:36,830
He's right
He's crazy

200
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:20,261
They're priority people
Belgians

201
00:32:20,381 --> 00:32:22,113
We'll get the others at Poitiers

202
00:32:22,613 --> 00:32:24,242
She can't pull everything

203
00:32:26,899 --> 00:32:28,668
I'll check if the train is ready

204
00:32:54,261 --> 00:32:55,594
And yet it's so nice outside

205
00:33:08,439 --> 00:33:09,846
They've split the train
in two this morning

206
00:33:11,476 --> 00:33:12,124
And your wife

207
00:33:13,383 --> 00:33:14,550
Are you crazy?
We're going too fast

208
00:33:26,885 --> 00:33:28,237
You'll find her in the next station

209
00:33:30,978 --> 00:33:31,820
Sure

210
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,473
This is becoming a calvary

211
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:34,982
What's it now?

212
00:34:35,797 --> 00:34:37,093
We've got the orders

213
00:34:37,213 --> 00:34:37,872
From whom?

214
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,344
The President of the Republic

215
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:40,659
Just great!

216
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:41,473
6 hours!

217
00:34:41,593 --> 00:34:42,344
What's going on?

218
00:34:42,464 --> 00:34:44,233
- The bridge is mined
- We can't stay there

219
00:34:44,353 --> 00:34:45,751
I can't let anyone through

220
00:34:45,871 --> 00:34:47,473
I take the convoy to Moulins

221
00:34:47,593 --> 00:34:49,807
- Don't take the main route
- I'll go as I was told

222
00:34:49,927 --> 00:34:50,902
It wasn't easy

223
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,087
I can't let you pass

224
00:34:52,207 --> 00:34:54,754
- I can't stay here
- Then go back from where you came

225
00:34:54,874 --> 00:34:56,680
In any case
The tracks are closed

226
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,610
Let us through or
I'll break your face

227
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:03,942
Stop it!

228
00:35:04,294 --> 00:35:05,155
Stop or I shoot!

229
00:35:07,979 --> 00:35:09,202
I'm shot!

230
00:35:23,793 --> 00:35:25,163
I got a solution

231
00:35:26,238 --> 00:35:29,029
If you don't have the right to stay and
you don't have the right to let us through

232
00:35:29,149 --> 00:35:30,552
We take over the train

233
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,312
Is that even legal?

234
00:35:32,432 --> 00:35:33,191
Not bad

235
00:35:33,728 --> 00:35:34,950
We can do it

236
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,598
It is legal

237
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:38,950
Civilians
roll up your sleeves

238
00:35:43,682 --> 00:35:44,867
You don't know how this works

239
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:46,645
Teach us

240
00:35:50,812 --> 00:35:51,886
Not that one

241
00:35:52,553 --> 00:35:53,572
Blow the whistle

242
00:37:38,909 --> 00:37:41,242
For my report:
What's this train?

243
00:37:41,362 --> 00:37:42,687
The extra train
from Sedan

244
00:37:51,731 --> 00:37:53,249
You often drive trains?

245
00:37:53,749 --> 00:37:54,990
No, but I didn't really drive

246
00:37:58,008 --> 00:37:58,582
It's funny

247
00:37:58,999 --> 00:38:01,129
You look kinda timid

248
00:38:01,815 --> 00:38:02,704
I am

249
00:38:03,518 --> 00:38:04,667
You don't look it
today

250
00:38:05,722 --> 00:38:07,259
Due to the circumstances

251
00:38:07,379 --> 00:38:09,314
I've never travelled like this

252
00:38:11,991 --> 00:38:13,500
***

253
00:38:14,306 --> 00:38:15,343
Really?

254
00:38:15,677 --> 00:38:17,658
I'm not the only one
We've all changed

255
00:38:31,062 --> 00:38:32,553
We make love tonight
If you like

256
00:38:36,067 --> 00:38:38,085
What are you so sad about?

257
00:38:38,409 --> 00:38:39,474
I did the other one

258
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,067
I thought there wouldn't
be another one

259
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:43,641
There will always be

260
00:38:44,419 --> 00:38:45,934
Men are so dumb

261
00:39:05,038 --> 00:39:06,983
The germans have technicians

262
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:08,354
Wait for them

263
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,057
Is there room in your train?

264
00:39:12,177 --> 00:39:13,650
For you, yes
my precious

265
00:39:14,265 --> 00:39:16,080
If you could give a hand
with the luggage

266
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,395
Roll up yer sleeves

267
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:19,617
Strong men lead the way

268
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:51,813
Your wife must be in front

269
00:39:51,933 --> 00:39:53,532
She's more comfortable than we

270
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:00,994
It's good like that

271
00:40:01,114 --> 00:40:02,068
pregnant

272
00:40:02,749 --> 00:40:04,443
She needs more care

273
00:40:05,406 --> 00:40:06,647
Are you very much in love?

274
00:40:06,767 --> 00:40:07,943
We're married

275
00:40:19,142 --> 00:40:20,531
No, I take it ...

276
00:40:24,928 --> 00:40:26,669
She'll a heart of mine

277
00:40:55,132 --> 00:40:56,298
Shit! We're bombarded

278
00:41:29,044 --> 00:41:30,470
I lost my shoes

279
00:41:51,524 --> 00:41:52,728
They're pretty

280
00:41:57,358 --> 00:41:58,543
They're from London

281
00:41:59,187 --> 00:42:01,409
- From where?
- London

282
00:42:03,076 --> 00:42:04,520
I had them made

283
00:42:07,956 --> 00:42:09,391
You went there often?

284
00:42:11,256 --> 00:42:12,719
Whenever I wanted

285
00:42:17,478 --> 00:42:18,663
Are you rich?

286
00:42:22,276 --> 00:42:24,350
No
Not me

287
00:42:54,978 --> 00:42:56,793
- Who's turn is it to deal?
- Your turn

288
00:44:32,374 --> 00:44:34,170


289
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:35,918
Last night, Big Julie saw us
She winked at me

290
00:47:36,735 --> 00:47:38,790
- What did you do?
- Same as she did

291
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:45,475
Have you ever
been on holiday?

292
00:47:45,595 --> 00:47:47,145
Yes
Before

293
00:47:48,126 --> 00:47:49,089
Me never

294
00:47:51,181 --> 00:47:52,311
Your turn

295
00:48:20,912 --> 00:48:22,653
We musn't take anything

296
00:48:22,773 --> 00:48:24,301
Ownership is a god given right

297
00:48:24,421 --> 00:48:27,042
For owners yes
But I have nothing

298
00:48:27,162 --> 00:48:28,486
Different story

299
00:48:34,681 --> 00:48:36,107
We have the right to eat, don't we?

300
00:48:36,227 --> 00:48:38,478
Right, I'm not talking about food

301
00:48:40,237 --> 00:48:42,330
One day in an empty house
I found a baby in its crib

302
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:44,382
What did you do?
You brought it up?

303
00:48:44,993 --> 00:48:46,401
No, it was dead

304
00:48:47,882 --> 00:48:49,790
You're really not
a happy chappy

305
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:54,657
I'm not talking about the food
but the other stuff...

306
00:48:55,287 --> 00:48:59,083
For my, net worth is more
important than food

307
00:49:12,969 --> 00:49:14,822
What if the train departs without us?

308
00:49:14,942 --> 00:49:16,319
What would that change?

309
00:49:18,273 --> 00:49:20,921
Before, I was always scared
of breaking these

310
00:49:28,417 --> 00:49:29,528
He's old

311
00:49:31,504 --> 00:49:33,976
I know a china man who sells these

312
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:38,087
- Which chinese man?
- From my village

313
00:49:39,494 --> 00:49:40,865
You're thinking about your wife

314
00:49:43,171 --> 00:49:44,375
She was with my daughter

315
00:49:44,986 --> 00:49:46,560
A little girl, seven years old

316
00:49:46,967 --> 00:49:49,597
- Do you have family?
- Yes

317
00:49:50,217 --> 00:49:51,477
Do you think about them?

318
00:49:52,067 --> 00:49:53,178
I'd rather not

319
00:50:03,412 --> 00:50:04,838
Never seen these before

320
00:50:05,597 --> 00:50:06,468
But I have

321
00:50:08,042 --> 00:50:09,838
He'll be coming straight for us
before long

322
00:50:09,958 --> 00:50:12,376
He will see we are a passenger convoy

323
00:50:12,496 --> 00:50:14,202
As if he cares...

324
00:50:14,322 --> 00:50:16,435
Don't say that
I've known decent germans

325
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,384
I've never known decent soldiers

326
00:50:18,504 --> 00:50:21,421
Not in germany, not here
Nowhere

327
00:50:21,844 --> 00:50:24,029
Give the signal
Let everyone assemble

328
00:50:55,281 --> 00:50:58,476
When I left the house I didn't foresee
meeting something like you

329
00:50:58,596 --> 00:50:59,976
SomeTHING ?

330
00:51:01,439 --> 00:51:02,865
Funny thing this war

331
00:51:13,438 --> 00:51:15,189
This is some good food...

332
00:51:20,345 --> 00:51:22,475


333
00:51:28,331 --> 00:51:30,739


334
00:52:33,955 --> 00:52:36,631
- People are often like that, when bored
- Bored?

335
00:52:36,751 --> 00:52:38,761
It's not boredom
It's the war

336
00:52:40,939 --> 00:52:42,013
The war

337
00:52:45,513 --> 00:52:46,902
Why are you not a soldier?

338
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:51,391
Bats are not soldiers

339
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:55,650
I would have been in
uniform 2

340
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:57,724
What's Uniform 2?

341
00:52:59,678 --> 00:53:01,474
Not as bad as
Uniform 1

342
00:53:03,659 --> 00:53:05,715
He's Uniform 1 for sure

343
00:53:07,242 --> 00:53:08,363
Is that so?

344
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:10,678
More embarrassing

345
00:53:10,798 --> 00:53:11,656
Not certain

346
00:53:15,869 --> 00:53:17,841
When I was little
I found it annoying

347
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:20,804
Not being near-sighted
but wearing glasses

348
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,807
In school, they called me Foureyes

349
00:53:26,298 --> 00:53:27,576
It wasn't easy
wih the girls

350
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,057
But then you get used to it...

351
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:31,918
or almost

352
00:53:53,328 --> 00:53:54,939
- No
- Why?

353
00:53:55,337 --> 00:53:58,050
'Cause I'm way past doing it for fun
Isn't it, Gorgeous?

354
00:54:12,727 --> 00:54:18,116
Moulins. The passengers of the
extra train from Sedan...

355
00:54:18,236 --> 00:54:25,116
...Troyes, Aubchères... need to visit the reception area at track 20

356
00:54:25,236 --> 00:54:30,616
Where they will receive more information about their family, parents and friends

357
00:54:33,958 --> 00:54:35,338
You have to go

358
00:54:41,571 --> 00:54:44,849
Go on
I'll wait

359
00:57:25,153 --> 00:57:28,097
We'll ask in the next station

360
00:59:05,003 --> 00:59:06,318
Could I borrow a screw driver?

361
00:59:18,795 --> 00:59:21,443
Funny how you don't know who the father is

362
00:59:23,073 --> 00:59:23,961
There were 3 of them

363
00:59:25,684 --> 00:59:27,554
It's difficult
He doesn't resemble any of them

364
00:59:30,879 --> 00:59:32,231
What are you doing later?

365
00:59:35,916 --> 00:59:36,990
Will you marry?

366
00:59:39,607 --> 00:59:40,959
I Don't know
I Don't care

367
00:59:44,292 --> 00:59:45,700
She's cute

368
00:59:52,354 --> 00:59:53,446
It's sunday

369
00:59:54,335 --> 00:59:56,187
- How do you know?
- I counted

370
01:00:10,645 --> 01:00:12,682
Do you think they're acting normally?

371
01:00:13,867 --> 01:00:15,849
Nothing is normal since it began

372
01:00:21,258 --> 01:00:23,999
- Funny, we're not from the same country...
- What country are you from?

373
01:00:32,433 --> 01:00:34,173
Which country are you from?

374
01:00:35,349 --> 01:00:36,655
I'm german

375
01:00:37,692 --> 01:00:38,877
How are you?

376
01:00:38,997 --> 01:00:41,099
I was in a refugee camp in Belgium

377
01:00:41,219 --> 01:00:42,674
We were right away liberated

378
01:00:44,581 --> 01:00:46,563
Why didn't you wait for the germans?

379
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:50,192
I'm german
but jewish

380
01:00:52,288 --> 01:00:54,696
Where I'm from some people
don't like us very much

381
01:00:57,307 --> 01:00:59,529
They want to eradicate us

382
01:00:59,649 --> 01:01:01,548
What do you mean "eradicate" ?

383
01:01:06,013 --> 01:01:07,790
With cold, with famine, with...

384
01:01:08,318 --> 01:01:08,976
fear

385
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:11,513
In camps

386
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:15,260
Why in camps?
What have you done?

387
01:01:15,853 --> 01:01:16,816
Nothing

388
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,094
And people say nothing?

389
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:23,760
They won't let us

390
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,400
They're also scared

391
01:01:30,696 --> 01:01:32,863
That's mind boggling

392
01:01:37,717 --> 01:01:39,513
Are you sure of this?

393
01:02:09,818 --> 01:02:14,110
<b><i>FRENCHIES! Your soldiers are disorganized.
We will control France within 1 week. </i></b>

394
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:17,610
<b>-<i>Stop running. Stay calm. Return home. You won't be harmed.</i> </b>

395
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:19,915
You were right
I must have been dreaming

396
01:02:25,445 --> 01:02:26,371
Look...

397
01:02:26,723 --> 01:02:28,630
Even the crossing guards have split

398
01:02:34,226 --> 01:02:37,078
I got in up north because
in the south it was getting impossible

399
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:39,263
And now...

400
01:02:39,383 --> 01:02:41,561
I'm going south again 'cause
things are impossible up north

401
01:02:41,681 --> 01:02:42,783
with Hitler

402
01:02:42,903 --> 01:02:45,222
Hitler's not any worse than this here kingdom

403
01:02:45,342 --> 01:02:46,667
or Switzerland...

404
01:02:46,787 --> 01:02:48,370
With their golden snowflakes

405
01:02:57,807 --> 01:03:00,399
Would you like to hold him?
I'm so sleepy

406
01:03:04,793 --> 01:03:05,923
Hello Poitiers

407
01:03:06,043 --> 01:03:08,886
I've got an extra train
He'll be with you in 10 minutes

408
01:03:09,006 --> 01:03:10,015
I hope

409
01:03:11,867 --> 01:03:13,164
No, it's the last one

410
01:03:13,284 --> 01:03:15,126
Some 300 meters of track
have been destroyed

411
01:03:15,246 --> 01:03:16,608
at the Gueré jonction

412
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:23,729
It's no life always running away

413
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:26,415
Facists grow everywhere

414
01:03:27,535 --> 01:03:28,896
Can we talk about something else?

415
01:03:29,016 --> 01:03:31,544
In 1918 I thought it was the last one

416
01:03:32,155 --> 01:03:33,637
That was really something

417
01:03:33,757 --> 01:03:36,543
One day people will be so scared
They don't want anymore war

418
01:03:36,663 --> 01:03:38,287
It won't be for tomorrow

419
01:03:38,407 --> 01:03:40,416
What does it matter
We won't be there anymore

420
01:03:40,536 --> 01:03:42,170
Is it not, Verdin?

421
01:03:45,207 --> 01:03:48,207
When I look at you
I feel like an animal

422
01:03:48,327 --> 01:03:50,207
When you don't look at me also

423
01:06:45,890 --> 01:06:49,001
- She was a big girl
- They died fooling around

424
01:06:49,121 --> 01:06:50,371
That's the way to go

425
01:07:00,002 --> 01:07:01,465
Is he yours?

426
01:07:01,585 --> 01:07:02,423
No

427
01:07:05,486 --> 01:07:07,042
His mother is dead

428
01:07:07,162 --> 01:07:08,431
Do you know his name?

429
01:08:11,129 --> 01:08:13,221
Don't you feel anything?

430
01:08:16,332 --> 01:08:17,443
I do

431
01:08:20,695 --> 01:08:22,417
Calm down

432
01:08:26,046 --> 01:08:27,620
Are we going again?

433
01:08:29,344 --> 01:08:30,825
Yes, don't get upset

434
01:08:32,196 --> 01:08:35,343
Call Marche, we'll have repair men
before nightfall

435
01:10:19,394 --> 01:10:21,190
What does he know?

436
01:10:22,838 --> 01:10:24,968
He was a newspaper editor

437
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:28,414
He liked freedom

438
01:10:28,534 --> 01:10:30,340
all the time travelling

439
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:34,136
Liberty was his passion

440
01:10:36,785 --> 01:10:38,396
One day, they took him away

441
01:10:41,359 --> 01:10:43,137
You speak like he's already dead

442
01:10:44,526 --> 01:10:46,526
These past 2 years, we haven't
heard from him

443
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:49,908
Nobody saw him

444
01:10:52,464 --> 01:10:53,538
After that

445
01:10:54,001 --> 01:10:55,890
they arrested my mother

446
01:10:56,010 --> 01:10:58,310
She was jewish

447
01:11:00,551 --> 01:11:02,106
After that my father

448
01:11:03,218 --> 01:11:06,069
Because he was married to my mother

449
01:11:08,302 --> 01:11:10,024
And after that,
me

450
01:11:11,913 --> 01:11:13,209
Tell me

451
01:11:14,116 --> 01:11:16,561
What are we gonna do when
the train reaches its destination?

452
01:11:54,094 --> 01:11:55,390
Alphonse...

453
01:11:55,909 --> 01:11:57,316
Look the other way

454
01:12:40,469 --> 01:12:41,617
Not a pretty sight

455
01:12:41,737 --> 01:12:42,912
Close your eyes
and it goes away

456
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:51,435
I read somewhere

457
01:12:51,555 --> 01:12:54,319
<i>We can't be helped on earth</i>

458
01:12:56,968 --> 01:12:58,282
And then?

459
01:13:03,387 --> 01:13:05,535
<i>I love you</i>
You wouldn't understand

460
01:13:08,202 --> 01:13:09,443
Go on

461
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,283
I like it when you sleep

462
01:13:18,505 --> 01:13:20,894
You don't seem frightened anymore

463
01:13:28,657 --> 01:13:31,102
I love you

464
01:15:31,634 --> 01:15:33,060
I wish you good luck

465
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:35,041
You will need it
as much as I

466
01:15:36,097 --> 01:15:37,193
Goodbye

467
01:15:37,313 --> 01:15:39,726
- I don't know anyone here
- Neither do I

468
01:15:40,124 --> 01:15:42,235
It's been a long time
since I walked on a beach

469
01:15:42,355 --> 01:15:44,439
Let's go see the boats

470
01:15:44,559 --> 01:15:47,253
I'm off, maybe I'll join some
who are going to America

471
01:15:50,423 --> 01:15:54,811
<i>allô allô</i>
<i>Message from the government</i>

472
01:15:54,931 --> 01:15:59,478
<i>the refugees without hotel reservation</i>

473
01:15:59,598 --> 01:16:02,534
<i>or a precise location of relatives</i>

474
01:16:02,654 --> 01:16:07,867
<i>please go to Red Cross desk at track 1</i>

475
01:16:07,987 --> 01:16:10,811
I don't want to
They'll put me in a camp

476
01:16:10,931 --> 01:16:13,645
Calm down

477
01:16:16,423 --> 01:16:18,163
Come with me

478
01:16:45,489 --> 01:16:47,359
Your wife might be in this town

479
01:17:19,667 --> 01:17:22,037
- Where are you from?
- From Fignonun

480
01:17:22,157 --> 01:17:25,037
- Where's that?
- Near the belgian border

481
01:17:25,565 --> 01:17:27,287
Are you reformed?

482
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:35,046
- Do you have money?
- Not much

483
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:40,039
Show me your papers
I'll arrange nice accomodations

484
01:17:45,965 --> 01:17:49,567
Maroiyeur...with a "y"?

485
01:17:50,919 --> 01:17:52,790
Radio repair man

486
01:17:54,604 --> 01:17:56,049
Go the Canes store tomorrow

487
01:17:56,169 --> 01:17:57,586
they're looking for an electrician

488
01:18:12,932 --> 01:18:15,599
This is my wife
She lost her papers

489
01:18:18,211 --> 01:18:20,359
I'll make her a temporary document

490
01:18:22,192 --> 01:18:24,637
Name of this young lady
Date and place of birth?

491
01:18:24,757 --> 01:18:26,581
Anna Duchène

492
01:18:27,563 --> 01:18:29,952
Born 13th of june 1912 in Soiçon

493
01:18:32,213 --> 01:18:33,324
Date of marriage?

494
01:18:33,732 --> 01:18:36,694
September 28, 1932 in Soiçon

495
01:18:39,618 --> 01:18:43,507
- Address?
- 18, Av. J. Baptiste Clément à Finois

496
01:18:49,433 --> 01:18:50,822
This is valid for 1 week

497
01:18:50,942 --> 01:18:55,103
I recommend you go to the city council
for a new ID-card

498
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:22,700
Please, let's leave this place

499
01:19:31,568 --> 01:19:33,364
Where do you want to go?

500
01:19:33,484 --> 01:19:36,237
Anywhere. Let's go

501
01:19:38,663 --> 01:19:40,589
Too bad. It was alright here

502
01:20:15,626 --> 01:20:17,228
Coast is clear

503
01:21:10,634 --> 01:21:12,338
In a minute, I'm going to the town hall

504
01:21:13,579 --> 01:21:14,505
For your wife?

505
01:21:19,913 --> 01:21:21,450
Before that, let's go over there

506
01:21:22,506 --> 01:21:24,858
To drink some coffee and
eat some croissants

507
01:21:29,034 --> 01:21:30,886
What's your real name?

508
01:21:40,572 --> 01:21:42,424
Mme Maroiyeur

509
01:21:42,961 --> 01:21:44,683
with a "y"

510
01:22:26,866 --> 01:22:27,792
Where is she?

511
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:30,681
In the hospital of Villiers

512
01:22:31,276 --> 01:22:32,869
Further up the Loire

513
01:22:33,739 --> 01:22:35,184
There's a bus service

514
01:22:37,591 --> 01:22:38,813
I'll go with you

515
01:22:40,665 --> 01:22:42,776
- You don't want me to?
- I do

516
01:22:46,310 --> 01:22:48,699
It seems the germans are
already on the Loire

517
01:22:51,551 --> 01:22:52,921
I don't want to stay alone

518
01:22:54,090 --> 01:22:55,164
Not yet anyway

519
01:23:21,022 --> 01:23:22,670
Where do you want me to put you?

520
01:23:26,823 --> 01:23:29,156
I work nights
I go to bed at 6

521
01:23:29,730 --> 01:23:32,101
If you like, I give you my room
for the time being

522
01:23:34,659 --> 01:23:37,622
- Is the hospital far?
- No, but it opens at 8

523
01:23:39,678 --> 01:23:42,863
I warn you, it's a small room
same price as the other rooms

524
01:23:51,668 --> 01:23:53,177
Keep things tidy

525
01:23:53,297 --> 01:23:55,510
You can pay later, I have faith in you

526
01:23:57,205 --> 01:23:58,761
Is she ill?

527
01:24:18,427 --> 01:24:20,779
I'm happy you found your wife

528
01:24:56,331 --> 01:24:58,054
It's them
I recogonize them

529
01:26:01,824 --> 01:26:03,121
It's a boy

530
01:26:05,065 --> 01:26:06,713
- You're happy
- Yes

531
01:26:11,515 --> 01:26:13,775
I'm going up, my little
girl is there too

532
01:26:13,895 --> 01:26:15,793
No, stay
I'll be back

533
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:18,849
See you later

534
01:27:12,507 --> 01:27:14,896
<i>My first pretty french girl</i>

535
01:27:37,944 --> 01:27:40,536
I didn't see Anna for 3 years

536
01:27:43,974 --> 01:27:47,122
Since the winter of 1940
life was back to normal

537
01:27:47,474 --> 01:27:52,030
Except for the germans and
the difficult rationing

538
01:27:53,975 --> 01:27:57,475
Spring and autumn 1941 went by
without special events

539
01:27:57,790 --> 01:27:59,975
I have little memory of those months

540
01:28:03,016 --> 01:28:06,016
There was never any mention of Anna

541
01:28:06,942 --> 01:28:08,886
I'd swear she knew

542
01:28:10,275 --> 01:28:11,831
She felt something

543
01:28:14,162 --> 01:28:17,717
I don't know if she realized
I almost had never seen her again

544
01:28:18,995 --> 01:28:22,125
Anyway, it had no bearing 
on her health

545
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:24,088
or on her fears

546
01:28:24,821 --> 01:28:27,747
She was never passionate or jealous

547
01:28:28,599 --> 01:28:30,914
She was mostly afraid of the germans

548
01:28:31,618 --> 01:28:33,803
an instinctive fear

549
01:28:34,155 --> 01:28:35,266
...physical

550
01:28:36,607 --> 01:28:38,163
Their footsteps in the street

551
01:28:39,033 --> 01:28:40,533
their music

552
01:28:41,978 --> 01:28:45,811
their notices on the walls 
bringing only bad news

553
01:28:47,412 --> 01:28:49,986
They came in the winter of 43

554
01:28:50,783 --> 01:28:52,134
I remember it well

555
01:28:52,254 --> 01:28:53,227
It was snowing

556
01:29:40,770 --> 01:29:44,233
I thank you for coming over
from so far at short notice

557
01:29:46,029 --> 01:29:48,288
It's only a formality

558
01:29:51,316 --> 01:29:53,465
Do you know this lady?

559
01:30:04,192 --> 01:30:07,210
I can tell her face 
doesn't ring a bell

560
01:30:08,321 --> 01:30:10,395
Maybe you forgot?

561
01:30:12,436 --> 01:30:15,288
That's what I thought
It must be a misunderstanding

562
01:30:15,408 --> 01:30:18,640
In any case, there's been 
some kind of ID-theft

563
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:20,418
Unpleasant isn't it?

564
01:30:21,630 --> 01:30:25,167
You were in La Rochelle in may 1940
I believe

565
01:30:26,852 --> 01:30:28,556
This person too

566
01:30:29,259 --> 01:30:31,019
Anna Kuepfer

567
01:30:31,388 --> 01:30:32,943
Does this name ring a bell?

568
01:30:35,980 --> 01:30:38,684
Not the name, not the face
I thought so

569
01:30:40,869 --> 01:30:42,517
I'm happy for you

570
01:30:43,388 --> 01:30:45,425
I have my doubts about her

571
01:30:45,768 --> 01:30:47,481
Not about you, on the other hand

572
01:30:49,018 --> 01:30:51,444
Married with 2 children

573
01:30:51,564 --> 01:30:53,607
The quiet life at Funoir

574
01:30:53,986 --> 01:30:57,811
Quite a job, how curious
radio repair man

575
01:30:59,607 --> 01:31:00,885
Very well

576
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:05,490
Please note it would have been benificial
to have known you

577
01:31:05,842 --> 01:31:09,902
To spend a difficult time in the company of someone impeccable

578
01:31:10,022 --> 01:31:11,657
Gotta grab that with both hands

579
01:31:12,511 --> 01:31:14,817
Sorry to have bothered you for nothing

580
01:31:16,361 --> 01:31:17,916
This is silly...

581
01:31:18,546 --> 01:31:21,194
Now you are here...
What's the harm...

582
01:31:23,806 --> 01:31:25,917
Bring her in 
just the same

583
01:32:19,982 --> 01:32:23,537
I can tell it says as little
to you as the photo

584
01:32:42,915 --> 01:32:45,710
You may leave Mr Maroiyeur

585
01:33:41,517 --> 01:33:44,665
So you do know Anna Kuepfer
Mr Maroiyeur

586
01:33:51,635 --> 01:33:53,413
Did she come back?

587
01:33:54,357 --> 01:33:56,116
Maybe you came back together

588
01:33:56,482 --> 01:33:58,278
Now everything becomes clear

589
01:33:58,398 --> 01:34:01,167
You join the Resistance
you train together

590
01:34:04,941 --> 01:34:06,219
A quiet little family life

591
01:34:06,857 --> 01:34:09,913
A wife and kids, so virtuous
A german mistress

592
01:34:10,033 --> 01:34:11,654
"<i>open</i>" for London

593
01:34:12,876 --> 01:34:15,783
You're in a bad way
Mr Barbié
