1
00:01:12,356 --> 00:01:15,108
I'm gonna have to carry ya?

2
00:01:21,073 --> 00:01:22,240
Come on.

3
00:01:51,187 --> 00:01:52,687
Oh, boy.

4
00:02:51,623 --> 00:02:54,250
All right. Drop your
gun belt, mister.

5
00:02:54,334 --> 00:02:56,127
What's this all about?

6
00:02:56,211 --> 00:02:58,421
The captain said
to drop the gun belt.

7
00:02:59,256 --> 00:03:00,715
Now!

8
00:03:13,478 --> 00:03:16,105
They're wearing the Johanson
brand, all right, Captain Wilson.

9
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:17,857
Whose else would they be?

10
00:03:17,941 --> 00:03:19,525
Where'd you get
those cattle, mister?

11
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:21,193
Just where
that brand says.

12
00:03:21,278 --> 00:03:22,361
Got them
from Johanson?

13
00:03:22,446 --> 00:03:23,446
That's right.

14
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,531
And you've got a bill
of sale to prove it?

15
00:03:25,615 --> 00:03:27,283
Hold it!

16
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:30,745
That's right.

17
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:33,622
I thought maybe you'd like
to look at the bill of sale.

18
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,667
We'll look at it.

19
00:03:51,141 --> 00:03:53,059
You say you got
this from Johanson?

20
00:03:53,143 --> 00:03:54,310
Yeah.

21
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,812
Mr. Maddow.

22
00:04:05,822 --> 00:04:08,157
Mr. Maddow, is that
Johanson's mark?

23
00:04:12,705 --> 00:04:15,540
Johanson didn't
have to make his mark.

24
00:04:16,292 --> 00:04:18,335
He could write
as good as you can.

25
00:04:22,757 --> 00:04:24,091
Hang him.

26
00:05:11,222 --> 00:05:12,472
Damn it!

27
00:05:17,395 --> 00:05:19,187
Look, I'm an ex-lawman.

28
00:05:19,272 --> 00:05:22,566
You can check with the sheriff,
Dave Ramsay of Saint Louis.

29
00:05:26,904 --> 00:05:30,574
Get Johanson! Let him
tell me face to face.

30
00:05:30,992 --> 00:05:32,993
For God's sake,
check it out!

31
00:05:44,965 --> 00:05:47,341
Are we gonna hang him
or beat him to death?

32
00:05:47,426 --> 00:05:48,634
Enough!

33
00:05:49,261 --> 00:05:50,261
Put him on his horse.

34
00:05:50,345 --> 00:05:51,888
Wait a minute,
the saddle!

35
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,973
You've no claim
to that, Reno.

36
00:05:54,057 --> 00:05:55,933
We got back Johanson's
cattle, Captain,

37
00:05:56,018 --> 00:05:57,685
and we got the man
that took them.

38
00:05:57,769 --> 00:06:00,855
Now, I like to see justice
done, but I'm taking the saddle.

39
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,523
Anybody want to argue?

40
00:06:02,608 --> 00:06:05,276
If he's a rustler,
he ain't got nothing I'd want.

41
00:06:06,612 --> 00:06:08,696
Well, he's got
something that I want.

42
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,533
I want his wallet. I want
it, and I'm gonna take it!

43
00:06:12,618 --> 00:06:14,035
Excepting if
he's a rustler,

44
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:17,705
how come he didn't make a run
for it when he had a chance?

45
00:06:18,582 --> 00:06:19,916
Wait a minute, Loomis.

46
00:06:23,253 --> 00:06:24,754
Now, tell me.

47
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,298
You bought some
cattle from Johanson.

48
00:06:29,468 --> 00:06:32,261
You saw the bill of sale.

49
00:06:32,346 --> 00:06:35,514
With the mark where Johanson
was supposed to write his name!

50
00:06:35,974 --> 00:06:36,974
Yeah.

51
00:06:38,644 --> 00:06:40,645
What did Johanson
look like?

52
00:06:42,814 --> 00:06:44,398
He's about 30.

53
00:06:44,483 --> 00:06:47,401
Dark hair, dark eyes,
heavy-set.

54
00:06:47,486 --> 00:06:51,113
Pockmarked face,
regular features.

55
00:06:52,491 --> 00:06:55,034
You have an eye for detail,
haven't you?

56
00:06:55,535 --> 00:06:59,330
I told you, I was a lawman.
That was my job.

57
00:06:59,414 --> 00:07:00,873
Heavy-set,

58
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,375
pockmarked,

59
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:04,168
about 30.

60
00:07:05,671 --> 00:07:06,837
Liar.

61
00:07:09,591 --> 00:07:11,509
Johanson was 60.

62
00:07:19,143 --> 00:07:24,314
Well, maybe it was his foreman,
or something, I don't know.

63
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:27,401
But we can go back there and
find out. It's only a day's ride.

64
00:07:27,485 --> 00:07:29,278
We could
check it out.

65
00:07:29,362 --> 00:07:30,404
Mr. Maddow.

66
00:07:31,614 --> 00:07:32,864
Tell him.

67
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,994
I just came from
the Johanson place.

68
00:07:37,287 --> 00:07:38,704
His herd was gone.

69
00:07:39,414 --> 00:07:43,417
I found Johanson and his wife on
the kitchen floor, gunned down.

70
00:07:44,752 --> 00:07:46,044
Dead.

71
00:07:46,713 --> 00:07:47,838
No.

72
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,845
Hang him.
You're making a mistake! No.

73
00:07:55,471 --> 00:07:56,805
No!

74
00:10:03,058 --> 00:10:07,019
Some people calls this hell, but
you're still in Oklahoma territory.

75
00:10:08,981 --> 00:10:10,398
Save your breath.

76
00:10:11,066 --> 00:10:13,109
I don't know who
hung you or why,

77
00:10:13,193 --> 00:10:15,736
but if you're innocent,
the judge will set you free.

78
00:10:16,698 --> 00:10:18,657
And if you ain't,

79
00:10:18,741 --> 00:10:21,118
they'll have to take the
trouble of hanging you again.

80
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,871
So come on,
get on your feet.

81
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:50,889
Water your mules and fill up
a bucket of water for the men.

82
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:04,988
Marshal Dave Bliss. I hear
you got a prisoner for me.

83
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:08,450
That's right, Marshal. Feed and
grain store right across the street.

84
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:10,785
Here's the key.
You'll be needing it.

85
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:22,172
Marshal.

86
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:24,799
Watch out for him.
He's plumb loco.

87
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:56,956
Oh, God! Oh, God.

88
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,797
Oh, my God.

89
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:12,931
Oh, God.

90
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:16,810
Oh, God.

91
00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:21,064
You've come to
kill The Prophet.

92
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:22,899
Take it easy, will ya?

93
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:26,654
Oh, God! You've come
to kill The Prophet!

94
00:16:26,738 --> 00:16:28,030
Can you walk?

95
00:16:28,114 --> 00:16:29,323
They're against me!

96
00:16:29,407 --> 00:16:31,867
They spy on me.
Oh, God.

97
00:16:32,577 --> 00:16:34,328
They're scared of
the wrath of God!

98
00:16:34,412 --> 00:16:35,412
Get on your feet.

99
00:16:35,497 --> 00:16:36,747
No!
Come on!

100
00:16:36,832 --> 00:16:38,999
Even the prison wagon's
better than this.

101
00:16:39,084 --> 00:16:41,293
You've come to kill
The Prophet!

102
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:43,838
Hold it!
Oh, no!

103
00:16:43,922 --> 00:16:48,259
Oh, God! Oh, God!

104
00:16:49,177 --> 00:16:50,344
You've come to
kill The Prophet!

105
00:16:50,428 --> 00:16:51,554
Damn you, hold it!

106
00:16:51,638 --> 00:16:54,765
Stop or I'll kill ya!
Oh, God!

107
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,059
Well, what are you waiting
for, Marshal? Shoot him!

108
00:16:57,143 --> 00:16:59,186
Kill him!
What's wrong, Marshal?

109
00:16:59,271 --> 00:17:00,813
Scared of
cheating a hanging judge?

110
00:17:00,897 --> 00:17:01,897
Kill him!

111
00:17:05,026 --> 00:17:10,239
Kill him! Kill him!
Kill him! Kill him!

112
00:17:10,323 --> 00:17:12,324
We'll look out
for ya, Marshal!

113
00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:15,035
We'll tell him you done your
best to bring him in alive!

114
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,370
Kill him, Marshal!

115
00:17:16,454 --> 00:17:18,372
Kill him, Marshal!
Yeah, kill him!

116
00:17:18,456 --> 00:17:21,375
Kill him!
Come on, kill him!

117
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,712
Hold it, damn you.

118
00:17:24,796 --> 00:17:25,796
Kill him, Marshal!

119
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:27,798
It's too damn crowded
in here anyway!

120
00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:31,051
Kill him, kill him.
Kill him, Marshal.

121
00:17:33,138 --> 00:17:34,346
God!

122
00:18:19,602 --> 00:18:22,437
You chained him.
Now you bury him.

123
00:18:30,321 --> 00:18:31,780
That ain't gonna
make the judge happy.

124
00:18:31,864 --> 00:18:34,991
What was I supposed to do,
let him escape?

125
00:18:35,076 --> 00:18:36,701
I ain't saying
you was wrong.

126
00:18:36,786 --> 00:18:38,954
I'm just saying it ain't
gonna make the judge happy.

127
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:41,790
Now that you've said it,
Williams, move them out.

128
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:23,665
Girls! Girls! The tumbleweed
wagon's here! Come on!

129
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,668
Save us the live ones,
Marshal, huh?

130
00:19:26,752 --> 00:19:29,296
Marshal, you're not
gonna hang them all!

131
00:19:32,718 --> 00:19:35,845
Here she is! Here comes
that tumbleweed wagon!

132
00:19:43,603 --> 00:19:45,563
And you'll send the
drapery material over?

133
00:19:45,647 --> 00:19:47,189
As soon as it comes in.

134
00:19:47,274 --> 00:19:49,150
And I'll be needing
more perfume.

135
00:19:49,234 --> 00:19:50,234
A dozen bottles?

136
00:19:50,318 --> 00:19:52,695
The cheapest, as long
as it smells good.

137
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:55,656
It's not for my girls. It's
for the Saturday night cowhands.

138
00:19:55,741 --> 00:19:57,033
They come off the range
smelling like...

139
00:19:57,117 --> 00:19:58,951
Here come
the tumbleweed wagon!

140
00:19:59,036 --> 00:20:00,619
Hey, isn't that
Billy the Kid?

141
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,874
Take a closer look. Maybe
you'll find your old man!

142
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:22,141
Hold it!

143
00:20:23,018 --> 00:20:26,145
We're going outside of town,
do some target practice on them!

144
00:21:21,702 --> 00:21:23,453
All right, move them out.
Giddap.

145
00:22:14,672 --> 00:22:16,089
Come on.

146
00:23:23,825 --> 00:23:27,703
You eats twice a day, 8:00 in the
morning and 4:00 in the afternoon.

147
00:23:27,788 --> 00:23:29,789
Unless you makes trouble and
get yourself short-changed,

148
00:23:29,873 --> 00:23:32,625
you get an hour a day
recreation in the prison yard.

149
00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:38,506
Better find yourself a spot.

150
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,758
Expecting another
wagon in this afternoon.

151
00:23:42,552 --> 00:23:43,636
You'll get used
to the smell.

152
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,180
If you don't, they got
a sure cure for it.

153
00:23:46,265 --> 00:23:48,266
They hang ya!

154
00:24:10,206 --> 00:24:14,710
Sounds like Schmidt's fixing to
have a little party this morning.

155
00:24:17,338 --> 00:24:18,839
A party?

156
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:20,882
A hanging party.

157
00:24:22,969 --> 00:24:25,387
Them's 200-pound
sacks he's dropping.

158
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:28,265
Gotta make sure
them ropes hold up.

159
00:24:28,349 --> 00:24:32,519
Always uses
top-grade hemp, Schmidt does.

160
00:24:32,603 --> 00:24:35,981
Oils it so it
slides real good,

161
00:24:36,065 --> 00:24:39,735
snaps your neck
like a dried-out twig.

162
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:43,405
Fine artist at his trade,
our Mr. Schmidt!

163
00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:50,203
That bastard!

164
00:24:56,878 --> 00:24:58,879
No!

165
00:25:00,423 --> 00:25:04,926
What kind of justice hangs a man
before he's heard about his appeal?

166
00:25:08,431 --> 00:25:10,015
No!

167
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:23,445
Come in.

168
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,252
Leave him.
Without shackles.

169
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,797
Yes, sir.

170
00:25:56,063 --> 00:25:57,563
All right, guard.

171
00:26:10,661 --> 00:26:13,579
Your story checks out, Cooper.
You're free to go.

172
00:26:21,004 --> 00:26:22,255
$11?

173
00:26:22,339 --> 00:26:25,925
And 40 cents. That's all McCleod
had on him when we picked him up.

174
00:26:27,136 --> 00:26:28,761
McCleod?

175
00:26:28,846 --> 00:26:30,888
McCleod was
running from the law,

176
00:26:31,765 --> 00:26:34,934
holed up at Johanson's place,
killed that old man and his wife,

177
00:26:35,018 --> 00:26:37,311
and then you blundered in.

178
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:41,107
A stranger looking to buy some
cattle, so McCleod sold you a few head.

179
00:26:41,191 --> 00:26:43,818
He must've got a pretty
good laugh out of that.

180
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,695
You wanna see
what he looks like?

181
00:26:46,613 --> 00:26:49,365
Come on.
Now, come on.

182
00:27:11,264 --> 00:27:13,223
McCleod took the money
he swindled from you

183
00:27:13,308 --> 00:27:15,726
and came into town,
looking for a good time.

184
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:18,145
The row, that's
where we found him.

185
00:27:56,309 --> 00:27:58,977
May God have mercy
on his soul.

186
00:28:00,605 --> 00:28:02,481
You're free to go, Cooper.

187
00:28:06,027 --> 00:28:08,487
With my $11.40?

188
00:28:08,571 --> 00:28:11,865
And the satisfaction of seeing the
man that got you into this mess hung.

189
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:15,452
What about the nine
just men who hung me?

190
00:28:15,954 --> 00:28:18,622
Just give their description to
one of the deputies downstairs.

191
00:28:18,706 --> 00:28:19,706
They'll try to
pick them up.

192
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:21,750
Well, that's not
good enough.

193
00:28:22,669 --> 00:28:27,714
Cooper, you take the law into
your own hands, and I promise you

194
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:30,926
you'll swing from one
of those ropes out there.

195
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:34,137
I know a little bit
about the law, Your Honor!

196
00:28:36,516 --> 00:28:37,766
That's right.

197
00:28:38,476 --> 00:28:39,893
You do.

198
00:28:42,648 --> 00:28:44,399
Sit down, Cooper.

199
00:28:46,986 --> 00:28:47,986
Please.

200
00:28:59,957 --> 00:29:02,625
You were a lawman
in Saint Louis,

201
00:29:03,335 --> 00:29:05,336
a damn good one.

202
00:29:06,589 --> 00:29:09,090
I can use
a good man, Cooper.

203
00:29:09,967 --> 00:29:12,302
Pay, 250 a month.

204
00:29:12,386 --> 00:29:15,471
That's 230 more than
you'd make as a cowhand,

205
00:29:15,556 --> 00:29:18,933
232 more than as
an army sergeant. Here.

206
00:29:19,018 --> 00:29:22,812
That hanging rope didn't
kill ya. Maybe my coffee will.

207
00:29:22,896 --> 00:29:24,606
How much did you
make in Saint Louis?

208
00:29:25,774 --> 00:29:29,110
It's 200 more than
I made in Saint Louis.

209
00:29:29,194 --> 00:29:31,613
250, plus expenses.

210
00:29:34,533 --> 00:29:37,535
I warn you, the pay is
a little slow in coming.

211
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:42,290
There. $200.

212
00:29:42,374 --> 00:29:45,918
Plus 50 President Harrison owes
you. You'll get it when I get it.

213
00:29:46,003 --> 00:29:49,339
Seems like you're a man
trying to give away money

214
00:29:49,423 --> 00:29:50,965
and don't have
too many takers.

215
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:54,135
You sound like a man who is
protesting the pay is too high. Don't.

216
00:29:54,219 --> 00:29:56,721
You sign on, you'll earn
every cent of it.

217
00:29:57,389 --> 00:29:58,931
There you are.

218
00:29:59,016 --> 00:30:02,977
The Oklahoma and Indian
Territory, year of our Lord, 1889.

219
00:30:03,103 --> 00:30:07,023
Nineteen marshals. I was
authorized 60 when I came here.

220
00:30:07,107 --> 00:30:09,317
Told the president even
that was not half enough.

221
00:30:09,401 --> 00:30:15,824
Nineteen marshals and one court
to cover near 70,000 square miles.

222
00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:18,661
A happy hunting ground
filled with bushwhackers,

223
00:30:18,745 --> 00:30:22,206
horse thieves, whiskey peddlers,
counterfeiters, hide peelers,

224
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:24,917
marauders that'll
kill you for a hatband!

225
00:30:25,001 --> 00:30:28,003
Now that's why there's a
badge in my desk, Cooper,

226
00:30:28,088 --> 00:30:31,507
itching to sit on somebody's
chest and no takers.

227
00:30:34,386 --> 00:30:37,429
Your marshals do cover
a lot of territory.

228
00:30:37,514 --> 00:30:41,225
You'll ride circuit over an area
half again the size of Rhode Island,

229
00:30:41,309 --> 00:30:43,435
if and when
it's Marshal Cooper.

230
00:30:45,939 --> 00:30:47,606
Pick up the badge,
Mr. Cooper.

231
00:30:52,362 --> 00:30:55,989
Pick up the badge, or leave
justice to me and my men.

232
00:31:06,793 --> 00:31:09,002
Those nine men,

233
00:31:09,087 --> 00:31:12,923
if you find them, they're to
be brought before me alive.

234
00:31:19,139 --> 00:31:21,849
That old horse should
hold you for a spell.

235
00:31:21,933 --> 00:31:24,059
All right.

236
00:31:24,144 --> 00:31:25,644
Good luck, Marshal.

237
00:31:25,729 --> 00:31:26,979
Thank you.

238
00:32:12,318 --> 00:32:14,319
You're Cooper?

239
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,697
Judge sent a wire
you was coming.

240
00:32:18,824 --> 00:32:21,242
Wasn't there
nobody outside?

241
00:32:21,327 --> 00:32:23,328
There's two men
with shotguns.

242
00:32:24,205 --> 00:32:27,624
I haven't had me a night's sleep
since we picked up the Swede.

243
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:29,793
How many men
did you bring with you?

244
00:32:30,377 --> 00:32:32,545
Can you have him ready
to go in a half hour?

245
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,924
Just the two of you?

246
00:32:37,009 --> 00:32:38,259
Yeah.

247
00:32:38,969 --> 00:32:41,387
The hotel here in town,
does it serve a good steak?

248
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,640
I better have something
to eat before we leave.

249
00:32:43,724 --> 00:32:47,519
If you're crazy enough to try
to take the Swede in alone,

250
00:32:47,603 --> 00:32:49,896
you got a right to
try it on a full stomach!

251
00:34:02,637 --> 00:34:04,638
You're under arrest, Reno.

252
00:34:08,643 --> 00:34:10,019
You talking to me,
Marshal?

253
00:34:10,103 --> 00:34:11,937
Your name's Reno,
isn't it?

254
00:34:14,858 --> 00:34:16,317
Look, Marshal, I don't
know what kind of town

255
00:34:16,401 --> 00:34:17,818
you're running here...
This isn't my town.

256
00:34:17,903 --> 00:34:21,071
Well, I wouldn't know.
See, I just rode in.

257
00:34:21,698 --> 00:34:25,117
Now, I'm gonna wash down
some trail dust, and...

258
00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:38,297
All right, Marshal,
what do you say I done?

259
00:34:40,383 --> 00:34:41,800
You don't remember me, do ya?

260
00:34:41,885 --> 00:34:42,968
No.

261
00:34:44,512 --> 00:34:47,681
When you hang a man,
you better look at him.

262
00:34:57,985 --> 00:35:01,279
Don't go for that gun, Reno.
I need you alive.

263
00:35:37,942 --> 00:35:39,943
Do you know him?
No.

264
00:35:40,945 --> 00:35:43,697
Anybody here know him?
Goes by the name of Reno.

265
00:35:43,781 --> 00:35:45,865
Come up here
and take a look at him.

266
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,742
He must've just rode in.

267
00:35:47,827 --> 00:35:49,536
That's what he said.
How much to bury him?

268
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,913
Elwood?
Well, I...

269
00:35:52,331 --> 00:35:54,791
$15 ought to do
a fair job, Marshal.

270
00:35:55,543 --> 00:35:58,670
All right. There's $7 there,
and I'll give you $8 more.

271
00:35:59,213 --> 00:36:01,214
And mark it down there.

272
00:36:03,342 --> 00:36:05,176
Don't anybody leave!

273
00:36:05,469 --> 00:36:08,346
I want everybody to write down in
this book exactly what they saw.

274
00:36:08,431 --> 00:36:10,056
I didn't see
nothing, Marshal.

275
00:36:10,141 --> 00:36:11,975
Fine, then you say
that in writing.

276
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:15,061
Nobody's gonna fault ya, Marshal.
You gave him every chance.

277
00:36:15,146 --> 00:36:16,688
Then
say it in writing.

278
00:36:17,106 --> 00:36:19,357
Marshal, I can't write.

279
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:23,821
Well, the sheriff here will write it
down, then you can put your mark on it.

280
00:36:24,906 --> 00:36:27,867
Sheriff, there's a saddle out there
belongs to me. I'll be taking that.

281
00:36:27,951 --> 00:36:30,119
If any of his friends
or relatives show up

282
00:36:30,203 --> 00:36:32,371
and want his horse or his
belongings, you let me know.

283
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:34,206
You can
wire me in Fort Grant.

284
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:36,459
You gonna pick up
the Swede now?

285
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:39,295
No, no. I'm gonna
have that steak now.

286
00:37:00,776 --> 00:37:02,401
Marshal.

287
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:06,322
The Swede! That's the one
the Marshal just brought in.

288
00:37:07,282 --> 00:37:08,824
Swede!

289
00:37:44,861 --> 00:37:46,487
What was that all about?

290
00:37:46,571 --> 00:37:48,322
That's Judge Fenton's orders.

291
00:37:48,406 --> 00:37:51,075
Nobody comes in or out
that lady don't look at.

292
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:54,496
Marshal! Judge wants to
see you right away.

293
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,081
Thank you.

294
00:38:08,344 --> 00:38:10,971
Good work,
Cooper. See?

295
00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:15,809
The good Lord takes care
of those that do his work.

296
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:18,937
He just waltzed in here
and gave himself up.

297
00:38:22,024 --> 00:38:24,276
I never wanted
to hang you, mister.

298
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,444
I asked them to
give you a chance.

299
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,156
Maybe you remember that.

300
00:38:29,866 --> 00:38:31,491
I remember that.

301
00:38:32,451 --> 00:38:35,328
I was here in Fort Grant
looking to pick up a grubstake

302
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:38,582
when I heard a marshal with a
hanging scar had killed Reno.

303
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:43,587
I knew then we...
We'd hung an innocent man.

304
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,423
So I turned myself in.

305
00:38:46,674 --> 00:38:48,466
The others?
He gave me their names.

306
00:38:48,551 --> 00:38:50,385
I've already made out
the warrants for their arrest.

307
00:38:50,469 --> 00:38:52,470
Where?
Red Creek.

308
00:38:53,222 --> 00:38:56,099
Good. I'll be on my way.

309
00:38:57,518 --> 00:39:01,188
All right, Cooper, you do it your way.
You round them up and bring them back.

310
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:04,065
I don't know why
you had to kill Reno.

311
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,318
It's in my report.
I wanted him alive.

312
00:39:06,402 --> 00:39:07,527
I needed these names.

313
00:39:07,612 --> 00:39:09,321
You got your names.

314
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:13,325
Mister, you make sure the rest
of those men get back here alive.

315
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:20,999
Jenkins? Sit down, please.

316
00:40:09,675 --> 00:40:12,468
You're under arrest. Move!

317
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:26,043
I have
seven warrants here.

318
00:41:27,045 --> 00:41:29,338
Matt Stone, M. Loomis,

319
00:41:29,422 --> 00:41:33,383
Maddow, Charlie Blackfoot,
Captain...

320
00:41:33,468 --> 00:41:36,053
Captain Wilson? Say, what
the hell is this all about?

321
00:41:36,137 --> 00:41:37,596
A lynching.

322
00:41:39,307 --> 00:41:43,685
Now, I understand four of these
men I'm after are out at the Big W.

323
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:45,854
Maddow and Miller
I'm not sure about.

324
00:41:45,938 --> 00:41:48,357
Maddow, he owns
a spread around here.

325
00:41:48,441 --> 00:41:50,609
Miller, he...

326
00:41:50,693 --> 00:41:52,444
Miller's a drifter.

327
00:41:53,279 --> 00:41:56,531
Look, Marshal, these men you're looking
for, they're all leading citizens.

328
00:41:56,616 --> 00:41:57,699
They're friends of mine.

329
00:41:57,784 --> 00:42:01,703
Well, these friends of yours are
wanted for conspiracy to commit murder.

330
00:42:04,874 --> 00:42:07,125
Now, if you'll put this
man in jail, Sheriff,

331
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:09,836
you and I can ride
out to the Big W.

332
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,994
Sheriff!
Sheriff Calhoun!

333
00:42:44,498 --> 00:42:46,165
Sheriff!

334
00:43:00,222 --> 00:43:02,557
Rustlers!
They took our herd!

335
00:43:02,641 --> 00:43:05,601
They killed my pa and Danny.
Killed both of them.

336
00:43:05,686 --> 00:43:08,396
I rode in and
found them there.

337
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,983
Pa and Danny, bushwhacked!
And the herd gone.

338
00:43:13,068 --> 00:43:14,652
I won't be much good
to you from here on out.

339
00:43:14,736 --> 00:43:17,071
My back is giving me trouble.

340
00:43:17,156 --> 00:43:20,908
You're in good hands, however.
This man here is a federal marshal.

341
00:43:21,118 --> 00:43:24,787
Don't give me that bad-back
stuff. You got your job.

342
00:43:24,872 --> 00:43:26,497
I've got mine
out at the Big W.

343
00:43:26,582 --> 00:43:30,042
His father and his brother's been
murdered. You a lawman or ain't ya?

344
00:44:23,431 --> 00:44:26,475
No more than five,
six hours ahead now.

345
00:44:31,856 --> 00:44:33,941
Now they must slow down.

346
00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:36,610
Yeah, well, we won't.

347
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:27,869
On your feet! Get up!
Get up! Get up!

348
00:45:36,964 --> 00:45:39,173
Cattle won't live
another day without water.

349
00:45:39,258 --> 00:45:41,259
Mick! Willie!
Head them home!

350
00:45:41,468 --> 00:45:42,719
Rafe, go with them!

351
00:45:48,892 --> 00:45:50,351
You've got one
minute to pray.

352
00:45:50,436 --> 00:45:51,978
There'll be
no hanging here.

353
00:45:52,062 --> 00:45:55,398
These men killed my father and brother.
They're gonna get what's coming to them.

354
00:45:55,482 --> 00:45:57,442
They'll get what the law
says is coming to them.

355
00:45:57,526 --> 00:45:59,944
If you can't stomach hanging,
why don't you ride out?

356
00:46:00,029 --> 00:46:01,446
We'll do what
needs doing here.

357
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:03,948
I'll say it
one more time!

358
00:46:04,033 --> 00:46:05,783
There's gonna
be no hanging.

359
00:46:06,368 --> 00:46:08,870
We're not turning
three murderers loose.

360
00:46:08,996 --> 00:46:11,706
That's right. You're turning
them over to me, the law.

361
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:13,458
I'll make sure
they get to Fort Grant.

362
00:46:13,542 --> 00:46:15,960
Fort Grant's better than
three days' ride from here.

363
00:46:16,045 --> 00:46:17,754
You'll never
make it alone, Marshal.

364
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:20,381
I didn't plan on
making it alone.

365
00:46:21,592 --> 00:46:24,093
Now, you men got
a $10 posse fee coming,

366
00:46:24,553 --> 00:46:26,679
and I can't guarantee the
government's gonna pay any more,

367
00:46:26,764 --> 00:46:29,766
but every man who sticks
with me will get an extra 10,

368
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:31,434
if I have to
pay for it myself.

369
00:46:31,518 --> 00:46:32,518
Uh-uh.

370
00:46:33,062 --> 00:46:35,104
I'll take my 10 now.

371
00:46:35,189 --> 00:46:36,898
I've got your name.
They'll send it to you.

372
00:46:36,982 --> 00:46:39,108
We'll put in for the
money ourselves, Marshal.

373
00:46:39,193 --> 00:46:40,401
Yeah.

374
00:46:44,823 --> 00:46:48,618
The men these rustlers killed,
they were my friends.

375
00:46:48,702 --> 00:46:51,329
These three,
they are for hanging!

376
00:46:56,085 --> 00:46:57,543
Leave us, Marshal.

377
00:46:58,170 --> 00:46:59,379
For just 10 minutes.

378
00:47:02,675 --> 00:47:04,093
Five minutes!

379
00:47:34,958 --> 00:47:36,500
On your feet.

380
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:39,545
Thank you, Marshal.

381
00:47:39,629 --> 00:47:42,381
I just want you to know, Marshal, we
had nothing to do with the killing.

382
00:47:42,465 --> 00:47:44,299
Shut up.
We rustled the herd all right,

383
00:47:44,384 --> 00:47:45,467
we did that,
but me and Ben...

384
00:47:45,552 --> 00:47:47,469
Didn't I tell you to
shut your mouth, boy?

385
00:47:47,554 --> 00:47:48,637
My brother's telling
the truth, Marshal.

386
00:47:48,722 --> 00:47:49,972
He done it.

387
00:47:51,641 --> 00:47:53,600
All right, Marshal,
all right.

388
00:48:18,251 --> 00:48:21,170
All right, saddle up those
horses, and nothing foolish.

389
00:48:30,096 --> 00:48:32,765
You're very kind, Marshal.
Would you be my friend, too?

390
00:48:32,849 --> 00:48:34,349
Forget about it.

391
00:48:37,897 --> 00:48:39,606
Say, I...

392
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:42,859
I seen you when you drug
that old Stone into jail.

393
00:48:42,943 --> 00:48:44,778
I thought that was
really something.

394
00:48:44,862 --> 00:48:48,031
I just about died
right then and there.

395
00:48:48,491 --> 00:48:52,577
I picked up my two amigos here
and rustled this fat herd,

396
00:48:52,661 --> 00:48:55,455
and we headed lickety-split
for south of the border.

397
00:48:57,875 --> 00:48:59,876
You know something,

398
00:49:01,879 --> 00:49:05,548
Mr. Deputy Marshal?

399
00:49:05,633 --> 00:49:10,136
You know, when I woked up and seen
that gun pointing right at my mouth

400
00:49:10,221 --> 00:49:13,264
and you standing
at the other end of it,

401
00:49:13,349 --> 00:49:17,769
I said to myself, "Miller, you
move one inch and you're a dead man.

402
00:49:17,853 --> 00:49:20,396
"This man's about to
blow your head off. "

403
00:49:21,607 --> 00:49:24,234
I mean, what them
boys said was right.

404
00:49:24,819 --> 00:49:26,778
We're guilty as hell.

405
00:49:30,574 --> 00:49:32,742
You know, when we
get to Fort Grant,

406
00:49:34,245 --> 00:49:36,162
all they're gonna do
is hang us.

407
00:49:37,873 --> 00:49:39,541
I tell you what.

408
00:49:40,543 --> 00:49:43,002
Why don't you be real smart

409
00:49:43,087 --> 00:49:45,421
and use your head,
you know?

410
00:49:46,423 --> 00:49:48,341
And let us go.

411
00:49:49,218 --> 00:49:50,510
Just let us go.

412
00:49:50,594 --> 00:49:54,013
We outnumber you three to one. You
can tell them that we jumped ya.

413
00:49:54,139 --> 00:49:57,934
And the boys and I, you know, we ain't
gonna be around to call you a liar.

414
00:49:59,228 --> 00:50:00,603
Get aboard, Miller.

415
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:06,359
I can't get aboard,
'cause my hands are tied.

416
00:50:07,319 --> 00:50:09,280
You're gonna have to help me.

417
00:50:14,703 --> 00:50:16,620
I said, get aboard.

418
00:50:16,705 --> 00:50:20,374
You ain't never gonna get
me alive to Fort Grant, boy.

419
00:50:20,458 --> 00:50:23,419
Then I'll get you
there dead, boy.

420
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:40,705
Get down.
The horses need rest.

421
00:52:07,942 --> 00:52:09,359
Start walking.

422
00:54:01,848 --> 00:54:03,849
Get aboard, Miller.

423
00:55:25,975 --> 00:55:27,475
Kill me.

424
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:38,570
Kill me!

425
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:15,482
Please. Please. I didn't set
out to touch her. I was drunk!

426
00:56:15,567 --> 00:56:19,320
Full of rotgut whiskey. I
didn't know what I was doing.

427
00:56:19,404 --> 00:56:21,280
Please, my family!
Take him away.

428
00:56:21,365 --> 00:56:23,783
What? No! Please!

429
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:27,745
My family! I didn't know
what I was doing!

430
00:56:27,829 --> 00:56:29,372
Please!

431
00:56:29,456 --> 00:56:31,332
Samuel Dodd.

432
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:33,668
Charge, whiskey peddling.

433
00:56:35,337 --> 00:56:37,004
Here, Your Honor.

434
00:56:42,511 --> 00:56:46,514
Marshal Cooper's coming down
the street with three prisoners.

435
00:56:46,848 --> 00:56:49,809
Court's adjourned.
8:00 tomorrow morning.

436
00:56:49,893 --> 00:56:52,812
All rise until His Honor
has left the courtroom.

437
00:57:26,221 --> 00:57:29,432
Sheriff in Red Creek wired you were
bringing three killers in alone.

438
00:57:29,516 --> 00:57:33,311
That was over two days ago.
I nearly gave you up for dead.

439
00:57:33,395 --> 00:57:35,855
You're a damn fool, Cooper.

440
00:57:35,939 --> 00:57:38,983
A bloody damn fool,
and the best there is!

441
00:57:39,067 --> 00:57:43,487
You hear that? Wake up,
you godforsaken people, you!

442
00:57:43,572 --> 00:57:45,906
The best there is, this
man here that works for ya!

443
00:57:46,033 --> 00:57:48,493
What's going on? Your
government, our country,

444
00:57:48,578 --> 00:57:51,872
the best country there is because
of men like Marshal Jed Cooper!

445
00:57:51,956 --> 00:57:53,206
I'm proud of you, boy.

446
00:57:53,291 --> 00:57:56,293
They're gonna hear about this, not just
in the territories, but in Washington!

447
00:57:56,377 --> 00:57:58,003
Across the length and
breadth of this nation,

448
00:57:58,087 --> 00:58:00,088
they're gonna know that name,
Jed Cooper!

449
00:58:00,173 --> 00:58:02,591
Well, what you do got
to say about that, boy?

450
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:22,736
Yahoo!

451
00:59:40,774 --> 00:59:43,317
Anything else I could
do for you, Marshal?

452
00:59:53,162 --> 00:59:57,123
Good Lord! You bring back half
of these, you'll have a wagonload!

453
00:59:57,207 --> 01:00:00,585
Well, you know me, Judge.
I like a lot of company.

454
01:00:00,669 --> 01:00:02,462
How long you
figure it'll take?

455
01:00:02,546 --> 01:00:04,839
Six, seven weeks,
give or take a month.

456
01:00:06,049 --> 01:00:07,550
Come in!

457
01:00:09,219 --> 01:00:10,761
Well, well, well!

458
01:00:10,846 --> 01:00:12,221
Morning.
Morning.

459
01:00:12,306 --> 01:00:15,433
The prodigal returneth
from a fate worse than death!

460
01:00:15,517 --> 01:00:16,684
Was that your idea?

461
01:00:16,768 --> 01:00:18,019
You fell right
in my arms, boy,

462
01:00:18,103 --> 01:00:19,854
and it's just the row happened
to be the closest haven,

463
01:00:19,938 --> 01:00:22,648
and since you didn't appear
to need a doctor's services...

464
01:00:22,733 --> 01:00:24,942
Well, I'll be on my way.

465
01:00:25,736 --> 01:00:27,778
See ya, Jed.
All right, Hayes.

466
01:00:28,363 --> 01:00:30,990
Aside from the girl
who served me breakfast,

467
01:00:31,074 --> 01:00:34,076
I didn't see anybody else
that I remembered.

468
01:00:34,161 --> 01:00:35,328
Do I owe them a bill, or...

469
01:00:35,412 --> 01:00:38,080
Of course! Just put it
on your expense account.

470
01:00:38,582 --> 01:00:40,500
Under what?

471
01:00:40,584 --> 01:00:45,129
You're gonna make me one hell of a
lawman, Jed. One hell of a lawman!

472
01:00:45,214 --> 01:00:48,883
Judge, about those three
that I brought in...

473
01:00:48,967 --> 01:00:53,514
All taken care of. I don't think they
spent as pleasant an evening as you did.

474
01:00:53,598 --> 01:00:57,017
No, but, I wanted to talk to you
about the two boys, Ben and Billy-Joe.

475
01:00:57,101 --> 01:01:00,354
Later, later, later. Write
it down when you got time.

476
01:01:00,438 --> 01:01:02,689
I just wanted to say,
as long as I'm here, that

477
01:01:02,774 --> 01:01:05,776
only Miller is to be
charged with murder.

478
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:09,154
See, if it wasn't for those two
boys, I might not have made it.

479
01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:10,489
Miller tried to kill me.

480
01:01:10,573 --> 01:01:13,200
If one or both of them had
pitched in and given him a hand...

481
01:01:13,284 --> 01:01:15,911
They pitch in to help
you subdue Miller?

482
01:01:16,037 --> 01:01:18,539
Well, no, but... All right.
Write it in your report.

483
01:01:18,623 --> 01:01:19,873
Hey, Marshal!

484
01:01:19,958 --> 01:01:21,792
If you catch
a whiskey peddler,

485
01:01:21,876 --> 01:01:24,002
let him go and bring
the whiskey back this time!

486
01:01:26,589 --> 01:01:30,217
Hey, Ace! Mind if I call
on that señorita of yours?

487
01:01:30,301 --> 01:01:32,678
I hear they got some
wicked women in Los Gatos!

488
01:01:32,762 --> 01:01:34,388
Catch us a few!

489
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,977
So long, Ace! Good hunting!

490
01:01:40,853 --> 01:01:42,312
Bliss is dead.

491
01:01:44,566 --> 01:01:46,650
Bliss? What happened?

492
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:52,239
He went to pick up one of the
Walker boys out of the Elmwood jail.

493
01:01:52,448 --> 01:01:56,118
The Walker clan, all seven
of them, were waiting.

494
01:01:56,369 --> 01:01:59,371
They shot him down, right there,
in the middle of the main street.

495
01:01:59,581 --> 01:02:02,124
Not a soul in Elmwood
lifted a hand to help him.

496
01:02:06,004 --> 01:02:07,838
Yeah, I owed
my life to Bliss.

497
01:02:07,964 --> 01:02:11,675
He was a man
with a backbone, a lawman.

498
01:02:12,885 --> 01:02:14,886
It won't be easy
to fill his shoes.

499
01:02:16,598 --> 01:02:17,681
No, it won't.

500
01:02:22,186 --> 01:02:25,064
Well, I'd better get
on back to Red Creek.

501
01:02:25,149 --> 01:02:26,691
Red Creek?

502
01:02:27,026 --> 01:02:30,612
Yeah, when the local sheriff wired
you, I don't suppose he told you

503
01:02:30,696 --> 01:02:33,031
that I arrested one of the
men who tried to lynch me.

504
01:02:33,115 --> 01:02:35,491
I was going after the rest of
them when this business came up.

505
01:02:35,576 --> 01:02:37,035
The man you arrested?

506
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:38,786
Name's Stone.
He's in the Red Creek jail.

507
01:02:38,871 --> 01:02:41,623
Good. That ought to hold him
till you're finished here.

508
01:02:41,749 --> 01:02:44,125
Finished here?
Testifying.

509
01:02:44,209 --> 01:02:45,710
Testifying? When?

510
01:02:45,794 --> 01:02:49,297
Boy, I got a backlog of cases
built up from here to Sunday!

511
01:02:49,381 --> 01:02:52,717
Well, I happen to have a prisoner
over there in that cardboard jail,

512
01:02:52,801 --> 01:02:54,719
and the sheriff who's
guarding him got a bad back,

513
01:02:54,803 --> 01:02:55,887
and if I don't get
back over there...

514
01:02:55,971 --> 01:02:58,556
You'll get back, Cooper!

515
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:02,101
You'll get back when I
tell you you're free to go.

516
01:03:04,855 --> 01:03:06,898
Cooper.

517
01:03:07,608 --> 01:03:11,736
You can be the best I've ever had, the
best there is, if you remember this.

518
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:14,405
You work for the government!
You work for justice!

519
01:03:15,574 --> 01:03:17,033
Come in.

520
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:22,455
Rachel?
Excuse me, Judge.

521
01:03:22,539 --> 01:03:24,457
I heard there were
three new prisoners.

522
01:03:24,541 --> 01:03:25,625
Yes.

523
01:03:27,419 --> 01:03:30,755
Marshal, why don't you take Miss
Warren down to the cell block?

524
01:04:02,831 --> 01:04:05,207
Two of them are just boys.

525
01:04:05,291 --> 01:04:07,459
Old enough to rustle cattle.

526
01:04:07,544 --> 01:04:09,336
You want them to hang?

527
01:04:09,421 --> 01:04:13,966
I just want them to get a fair
trial. Who do you want to hang?

528
01:04:19,681 --> 01:04:21,640
We all have our
ghosts, Marshal.

529
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:24,059
You hunt your way,

530
01:04:24,936 --> 01:04:26,478
I hunt mine.

531
01:04:43,496 --> 01:04:46,165
All right, you claim you
didn't pull the trigger.

532
01:04:47,167 --> 01:04:49,209
Let's forget about
the killings.

533
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:55,674
Rustling is a hanging offense, and
they are all guilty, all three of them!

534
01:04:56,384 --> 01:05:00,387
No matter whose idea it was,
they're all guilty.

535
01:05:00,472 --> 01:05:02,681
That's the law.
Object!

536
01:05:02,766 --> 01:05:04,141
Sustained.

537
01:05:04,601 --> 01:05:06,185
You, sir.

538
01:05:08,438 --> 01:05:10,856
You will elicit facts
from the witness.

539
01:05:11,149 --> 01:05:13,567
I will tell the jury
what's the law.

540
01:05:13,651 --> 01:05:14,693
Yes, sir.

541
01:05:14,778 --> 01:05:16,737
No further questions,
Your Honor.

542
01:05:16,821 --> 01:05:22,034
The jury will disregard all of the
prosecution's remarks concerning the law.

543
01:05:24,496 --> 01:05:26,330
All right, son.

544
01:05:26,915 --> 01:05:29,000
You may step down now.

545
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:35,006
Call your next witness.

546
01:05:35,090 --> 01:05:37,675
Marshal Jedediah Cooper!

547
01:05:45,559 --> 01:05:48,061
Do you solemnly swear to tell the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but,

548
01:05:48,145 --> 01:05:49,687
so help you God?
I do.

549
01:05:49,772 --> 01:05:52,148
Marshal, at the time
of their apprehension,

550
01:05:52,233 --> 01:05:55,485
did any of these three
defendants deny their guilt?

551
01:05:56,070 --> 01:05:58,154
Well, no, but on
the trail back here...

552
01:05:58,239 --> 01:06:01,032
Marshal, we're not interested
in the trip back to Fort Grant.

553
01:06:01,116 --> 01:06:02,450
It was a heroic journey.

554
01:06:02,535 --> 01:06:05,578
The whole court, the whole
territory, is grateful.

555
01:06:05,663 --> 01:06:08,164
Your Honor, I think something
that happened on the trail

556
01:06:08,249 --> 01:06:09,999
back here has
a bearing on the case.

557
01:06:10,084 --> 01:06:11,584
Something happen
that leads you to believe

558
01:06:11,669 --> 01:06:14,379
that one or all three of
these defendants are innocent?

559
01:06:14,463 --> 01:06:17,924
Well, of murder, yes. You see,
both Ben and Billy-Joe told me...

560
01:06:18,008 --> 01:06:22,262
Marshal, this court is not
concerned with hearsay evidence.

561
01:06:22,346 --> 01:06:24,848
This court requires facts.

562
01:06:24,932 --> 01:06:29,018
The defendants, all three, are charged
with murder and rustling. Facts,

563
01:06:29,103 --> 01:06:31,104
the only matter that
concerns this court.

564
01:06:31,188 --> 01:06:33,690
I thought this court
was concerned with justice.

565
01:06:33,774 --> 01:06:38,319
Justice is my province,
Marshal! Mine, and mine alone!

566
01:06:39,113 --> 01:06:42,365
Now, you'll confine yourself to giving
direct answers to direct questions

567
01:06:42,449 --> 01:06:44,200
or find yourself in
contempt of court! Proceed.

568
01:06:44,285 --> 01:06:46,828
One of those boys is 18,
the other's only 16.

569
01:06:46,954 --> 01:06:49,163
That'll cost you $10. Neither
one of them's been in trouble...

570
01:06:49,248 --> 01:06:51,040
$20. ... with the law.
If it wasn't for them...

571
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:56,629
$30! One more word, you'll
spend 30 days in the hole.

572
01:06:56,714 --> 01:07:00,050
Do you have any further
questions for this witness?

573
01:07:00,135 --> 01:07:02,595
No more questions,
Your Honor.

574
01:07:04,973 --> 01:07:07,558
Then you may
step down, Marshal.

575
01:07:50,852 --> 01:07:52,269
Yeah?

576
01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:57,274
Sheriff Ray Calhoun,
Red Creek.

577
01:07:57,525 --> 01:07:59,151
I recognize you.

578
01:08:03,448 --> 01:08:07,159
I wanna congratulate you on the job
you did bringing in those rustlers.

579
01:08:08,370 --> 01:08:11,705
You mean, you rode all the way over
here from Red Creek, bad back and all,

580
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:13,999
just to tell me that?

581
01:08:14,292 --> 01:08:15,793
No.

582
01:08:16,294 --> 01:08:17,753
Stone's dead.

583
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:21,548
What happened, Calhoun?

584
01:08:23,635 --> 01:08:27,554
It didn't make no sense, him
sitting in that cell going crazy

585
01:08:27,639 --> 01:08:29,556
in a town without
no blacksmith.

586
01:08:33,854 --> 01:08:35,605
He promised that if I'd
turn him loose every day

587
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:37,482
for a couple of hours
to work at his trade

588
01:08:37,566 --> 01:08:39,859
that he'd come back
to his cell each night.

589
01:08:40,277 --> 01:08:43,154
And he did, came back
every night but one.

590
01:08:44,407 --> 01:08:46,199
I rode out to his home,

591
01:08:46,283 --> 01:08:49,828
a home where I had many a
dinner, the home of a friend.

592
01:08:51,122 --> 01:08:54,624
I had to bring him back and
put him in his cell at gunpoint.

593
01:08:55,292 --> 01:08:57,127
He made a break for it.

594
01:08:57,211 --> 01:09:00,255
I tried to shoot low,
but I'm not very good at that.

595
01:09:06,178 --> 01:09:09,180
I heard you paid 800 to the
skunk who murdered the Johansons

596
01:09:09,265 --> 01:09:11,057
and sold you their herd.

597
01:09:12,893 --> 01:09:14,352
That's right.

598
01:09:14,437 --> 01:09:16,896
How much did you get back
when they were caught?

599
01:09:18,733 --> 01:09:20,734
$11.40.

600
01:09:24,363 --> 01:09:27,782
There's 800 in this
envelope. It's yours.

601
01:09:28,117 --> 01:09:29,993
Or you can keep
the 100 head.

602
01:09:30,077 --> 01:09:31,661
Prime, every one of them.

603
01:09:32,788 --> 01:09:35,415
I don't have much use
for cattle these days.

604
01:09:36,125 --> 01:09:37,709
Here's 10.

605
01:09:38,044 --> 01:09:40,045
Keep it.
Hold it!

606
01:09:46,677 --> 01:09:52,140
Here's $11.40

607
01:09:52,308 --> 01:09:54,517
for the aggravation
they caused me.

608
01:09:55,019 --> 01:09:58,063
Now, you take that bad back of
yours right over to Red Creek

609
01:09:58,147 --> 01:10:01,649
and tell your friends
we're even, money-wise.

610
01:10:15,123 --> 01:10:16,791
So,

611
01:10:17,834 --> 01:10:19,627
it's no deal.

612
01:10:21,046 --> 01:10:23,672
He figures you still
owe him for a lynching.

613
01:10:23,757 --> 01:10:26,926
And I told you, you never
should've offered him the money.

614
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:29,095
All right.

615
01:10:29,179 --> 01:10:31,555
Now that makes three
mistakes we made:

616
01:10:31,973 --> 01:10:33,766
the money,

617
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:36,393
we hung an innocent man,

618
01:10:36,478 --> 01:10:38,479
and we didn't
finish the job.

619
01:10:40,065 --> 01:10:42,566
We can't undo
the first two,

620
01:10:43,777 --> 01:10:46,195
but we can still
finish the job.

621
01:10:52,702 --> 01:10:54,912
I didn't hear that,
Captain Wilson.

622
01:10:54,996 --> 01:10:56,997
I didn't hear none of it.

623
01:11:01,795 --> 01:11:05,089
I'm riding back to Red Creek.
Are you coming with me?

624
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:15,057
Charlie! You've been with me
better than five years.

625
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:18,686
Good years, Captain.

626
01:11:18,770 --> 01:11:21,689
Maybe if it was my land
I was fighting to hold...

627
01:11:22,107 --> 01:11:27,403
No, Captain. If that marshal wants Charlie
Blackfoot, he's gonna have to find him.

628
01:11:32,909 --> 01:11:34,577
Sorry, Captain Wilson.

629
01:11:34,661 --> 01:11:36,705
Maddow, you're
damn near my age.

630
01:11:36,789 --> 01:11:38,623
You wouldn't last
six months in that jail!

631
01:11:38,708 --> 01:11:40,375
I don't intend to try to.

632
01:11:40,459 --> 01:11:42,002
I can still ride
pretty good.

633
01:11:42,086 --> 01:11:43,795
You can shoot
even better!

634
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,505
I'm sorry, Captain.

635
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:47,340
Maddow, he'll
come after you.

636
01:11:47,425 --> 01:11:49,718
He'll keep coming. You'll
be nothing but an animal,

637
01:11:49,802 --> 01:11:53,305
an animal running scared!

638
01:11:53,389 --> 01:11:54,890
Sorry, Captain.

639
01:12:06,944 --> 01:12:09,237
How about you two? You sure?

640
01:12:10,114 --> 01:12:11,781
Tommy?

641
01:12:13,242 --> 01:12:15,118
It was wrong
to hang that man.

642
01:12:15,203 --> 01:12:17,245
We all know it now.

643
01:12:18,122 --> 01:12:20,749
I was hoping we could
square it with him.

644
01:12:20,833 --> 01:12:23,168
My wife, she was
kinda hoping it, too.

645
01:12:25,838 --> 01:12:27,839
Loomis?

646
01:12:29,467 --> 01:12:33,970
I'm 37, 38. I don't
rightly know for sure.

647
01:12:35,223 --> 01:12:37,557
I started drifting
when I was just a kid.

648
01:12:38,809 --> 01:12:41,186
These last few years
working for you,

649
01:12:45,483 --> 01:12:46,983
it's the first home
I ever knew.

650
01:12:49,195 --> 01:12:50,862
I've saved a few dollars,

651
01:12:50,947 --> 01:12:53,531
thinking of finding
myself a woman,

652
01:12:53,616 --> 01:12:57,535
staking out a few acres
of my own, when this come up.

653
01:12:57,620 --> 01:12:59,746
You mean,
when I brought it up.

654
01:13:00,539 --> 01:13:03,124
You didn't force me
to ride with you, Captain.

655
01:13:04,377 --> 01:13:07,797
I thought we was doing
the right thing. We was.

656
01:13:08,799 --> 01:13:10,925
Hanging the wrong man
don't change that.

657
01:13:11,009 --> 01:13:13,928
Five years, even 10,

658
01:13:14,137 --> 01:13:17,265
you two can survive it and still
come out to live some kind of life.

659
01:13:17,349 --> 01:13:19,350
What kind, Captain?

660
01:13:19,434 --> 01:13:23,646
I been a free man. It's the
only kind of life I know.

661
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:26,315
My wife Thelma,
she's a young woman.

662
01:13:26,984 --> 01:13:29,277
She wants kids and a family.

663
01:13:30,028 --> 01:13:32,321
Even if I asked her
to wait for me,

664
01:13:32,698 --> 01:13:34,699
even if she said she would,

665
01:13:35,450 --> 01:13:37,535
I couldn't be sure.

666
01:13:43,041 --> 01:13:45,042
Let's ride, gentlemen.

667
01:14:04,646 --> 01:14:06,397
Hey, mister,
where's the hotel?

668
01:14:06,481 --> 01:14:08,983
Down the street. But
keep going, it's full up.

669
01:14:09,067 --> 01:14:11,193
The whole town's full up
with this hanging.

670
01:14:11,278 --> 01:14:13,821
I hear they got tents set up
out in the boondocks.

671
01:14:13,905 --> 01:14:16,574
Well, thank you
kindly. Giddap!

672
01:14:37,346 --> 01:14:39,306
Who is it?
Open up.

673
01:14:47,106 --> 01:14:49,858
I just came here, Your Honor, to tell
you about the biggest thing that happened

674
01:14:49,942 --> 01:14:52,986
in this territory,
bigger than statehood!

675
01:14:53,071 --> 01:14:55,739
People showing up by the wagon
full, men, women and children,

676
01:14:55,823 --> 01:14:57,491
all just to see
your lousy hanging.

677
01:14:57,575 --> 01:14:59,117
That's enough, Cooper.

678
01:14:59,202 --> 01:15:01,328
To see your circus,
a six-man hanging.

679
01:15:01,412 --> 01:15:03,038
I said, that's enough!

680
01:15:03,122 --> 01:15:06,708
You stink of whiskey, son. Just go back
to your room. Lie down. Sleep it off.

681
01:15:06,793 --> 01:15:08,794
You're lynching
those boys. Why?

682
01:15:09,587 --> 01:15:11,797
Why?
Yeah.

683
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,761
Because of you, Cooper.

684
01:15:19,931 --> 01:15:23,850
Because of that beautiful, that
magnificent journey you took

685
01:15:23,935 --> 01:15:26,937
to bring three
killers to justice.

686
01:15:27,021 --> 01:15:30,065
Because if the law didn't hang them,
the next posse that goes out would say,

687
01:15:30,149 --> 01:15:33,151
"Hang them, and hang them high!
There's no justice in Fort Grant. "

688
01:15:33,236 --> 01:15:34,653
And if there's no justice
in Fort Grant, Cooper,

689
01:15:34,737 --> 01:15:36,696
there'll be no statehood
for this territory.

690
01:15:36,781 --> 01:15:39,366
Well, I don't care
how you slice it.

691
01:15:39,450 --> 01:15:41,618
Whether it's nine men out
on a plain with a dirty rope

692
01:15:41,702 --> 01:15:45,372
or a judge with his robes on
in front of the American flag,

693
01:15:45,456 --> 01:15:48,625
those boys are gonna be just as
dead as if they'd been lynched.

694
01:15:49,669 --> 01:15:52,170
That's right, Cooper,
just as dead.

695
01:15:52,255 --> 01:15:54,756
But they won't have been lynched.
They will have been judged.

696
01:15:54,841 --> 01:15:59,010
And if you can't see the difference, you
better take off that star, and right now!

697
01:16:01,055 --> 01:16:03,056
Not just yet,
Your Honor.

698
01:16:05,601 --> 01:16:12,442
Yes,
we'll gather at the river

699
01:16:12,526 --> 01:16:19,365
The beautiful,
the beautiful river

700
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:26,205
Gather with the saints
at the river

701
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:32,378
That flows by
the throne of God

702
01:16:34,339 --> 01:16:40,887
Shall we gather at the river

703
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:43,681
Where bright...

704
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:45,016
Get your cold beer here!

705
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:47,685
Sarsaparilla for all the kiddies!
Pretzels! Licorice sticks!

706
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:49,395
Get your cold beer! Cold beer!

707
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:59,322
Rachel, last chance, drapes can
wait. Sure you won't change your mind?

708
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:03,701
Sophie, I told you before. There's
only one hanging I'm interested in.

709
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:16,589
Soon our pilgrimage will cease

710
01:17:16,673 --> 01:17:22,678
Soon our happy
hearts will quiver

711
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:29,477
With the melody of peace

712
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:33,105
Dad, please!
No! I said no!

713
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:36,442
...at the river

714
01:17:37,444 --> 01:17:44,076
The beautiful,
the beautiful river

715
01:17:44,661 --> 01:17:50,832
Gather with the saints
at the river

716
01:17:50,917 --> 01:17:56,797
That flows by
the throne of God

717
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:57,149
Cold beer! Sarsaparilla
for all the kiddies!

718
01:18:57,275 --> 01:18:59,067
Hey! Hey! Pretzels! Licorice sticks!

719
01:18:59,152 --> 01:19:03,155
Get your cold beer! Get your cold beer
here! Sarsaparilla for all the kiddies!

720
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:06,241
Pretzels, licorice sticks. Get your
cold beer! Cold beer! Right here.

721
01:19:06,326 --> 01:19:09,369
Cold beer! Right here.
Sarsaparilla for the kiddies!

722
01:19:09,454 --> 01:19:12,289
Cold beer! Here's your change.
Here's your change. Cold beer!

723
01:19:12,373 --> 01:19:14,124
Here's 5, here's 10.
Cold beer!

724
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:17,545
Sarsaparilla for the kiddies.
Licorice sticks. Cold beer!

725
01:19:17,630 --> 01:19:20,131
Sarsaparilla for all the kiddies.
There you are, young thing.

726
01:19:20,215 --> 01:19:22,967
Hey, what are you doing?

727
01:19:23,052 --> 01:19:25,637
Can't you please
see me tomorrow?

728
01:19:25,721 --> 01:19:27,889
I don't want to
miss the hanging!

729
01:19:29,808 --> 01:19:34,020
"And the Lord said,
'Acknowledge thy sins unto me,

730
01:19:34,104 --> 01:19:37,649
"'confess thy iniquities and
transgressions unto the Lord,

731
01:19:37,733 --> 01:19:39,442
"'and he will forgive
thee thy sins. "'

732
01:19:39,526 --> 01:19:42,570
Now, Preacher?
Patience, patience.

733
01:19:45,449 --> 01:19:49,577
"Blessed is the man that walketh
not in the counsel of the ungodly,

734
01:19:49,662 --> 01:19:51,788
"nor standeth in
the way of sinners,

735
01:19:51,872 --> 01:19:54,791
"nor sitteth in the
seat of the scornful.

736
01:19:54,875 --> 01:20:00,004
"But his delight is in
the law of the Lord,

737
01:20:00,089 --> 01:20:04,425
"and in his law doth he
meditate day and night.

738
01:20:05,427 --> 01:20:10,056
"And he shall be like a tree
planted by the rivers of water

739
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:13,685
"that bringeth forth
his fruit in his season.

740
01:20:14,269 --> 01:20:16,688
"His leaf shall not wither,

741
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:19,816
"and whatever he doeth
shall prosper. "

742
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:21,776
Amen.

743
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:27,532
We will now sing
Rock of Ages.

744
01:20:27,616 --> 01:20:30,493
Get your cold beer and your sarsaparilla
for all the kids, right here!

745
01:20:30,577 --> 01:20:34,706
Rock of ages

746
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:38,501
Cleft for me

747
01:20:38,585 --> 01:20:45,466
Let me hide myself in thee

748
01:20:46,218 --> 01:20:53,142
Let the water and the blood

749
01:20:53,643 --> 01:20:55,978
From thy wounded

750
01:20:57,313 --> 01:21:01,150
Side which flowed

751
01:21:01,359 --> 01:21:08,198
Be of sin the double cure

752
01:21:08,950 --> 01:21:15,330
Save from wrath
and make me pure

753
01:21:17,834 --> 01:21:24,840
While I draw
this fleeting breath

754
01:21:25,508 --> 01:21:32,222
When mine eyes
shall close in death

755
01:21:33,349 --> 01:21:40,230
When I rise to worlds unknown

756
01:21:40,857 --> 01:21:47,488
And behold thee on thy throne

757
01:21:48,698 --> 01:21:52,659
Rock of ages

758
01:21:52,744 --> 01:21:56,079
Cleft for me

759
01:21:57,665 --> 01:22:03,295
Let me hide myself in thee

760
01:22:09,886 --> 01:22:12,554
Do you have last requests?

761
01:22:13,056 --> 01:22:14,139
Do you have
last requests?

762
01:22:14,224 --> 01:22:16,975
I'd sure like me
a chaw of tobacco.

763
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:19,145
What's the matter, hangman?
You afraid I'll choke

764
01:22:19,230 --> 01:22:21,898
and cheat you out
of your hanging fee?

765
01:22:33,577 --> 01:22:34,661
Mmm.

766
01:22:34,745 --> 01:22:36,287
Put it in my pocket.

767
01:22:44,672 --> 01:22:45,755
Mmm! Mmm!

768
01:23:03,274 --> 01:23:04,649
Now, Preacher?

769
01:23:04,733 --> 01:23:06,317
You may say
your piece now, Duffy.

770
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:13,867
You are now looking
for the last time

771
01:23:13,951 --> 01:23:17,704
at the mortal body
of Francis Elroy Duffy,

772
01:23:17,788 --> 01:23:19,706
born to John and Edna Duffy...

773
01:23:19,790 --> 01:23:21,207
Do you have
last requests?

774
01:23:21,292 --> 01:23:24,043
...good, God-fearing folk,

775
01:23:24,128 --> 01:23:26,087
who raised me up
to be a good man...

776
01:23:26,171 --> 01:23:28,548
Ben?
... a good Christian...

777
01:23:28,632 --> 01:23:31,926
Bye, Ben. Bye.

778
01:23:32,011 --> 01:23:34,888
a good husband
to my beloved wife,

779
01:23:34,972 --> 01:23:37,557
a good father
to my children,

780
01:23:37,641 --> 01:23:39,434
whom I leave behind,

781
01:23:39,518 --> 01:23:44,898
hoping that they
and all you will learn...

782
01:23:44,982 --> 01:23:46,190
Do you have
last requests?

783
01:23:46,275 --> 01:23:48,943
...this here lesson
which I leave you with.

784
01:24:05,629 --> 01:24:11,008
When you take the devil into
your mouths, you are doomed!

785
01:24:11,176 --> 01:24:16,805
For he is lying there in wait for
you inside that bottle of whiskey,

786
01:24:17,515 --> 01:24:20,434
waiting for you to take
him into your mouth...

787
01:24:20,518 --> 01:24:21,810
Do you have
last requests?

788
01:24:21,895 --> 01:24:24,355
...waiting to get down
into your guts...

789
01:24:24,439 --> 01:24:26,649
Tell him to shut up
and let's get it over with.

790
01:24:26,733 --> 01:24:29,652
...where he can do
his devil's work.

791
01:24:29,736 --> 01:24:34,865
Liquor is the most foul,
evil thing in this here world!

792
01:24:35,575 --> 01:24:39,036
It destroyed good
men like myself.

793
01:24:39,746 --> 01:24:41,497
It'll destroy you, too.

794
01:24:41,581 --> 01:24:42,623
Do you have
last requests?

795
01:24:42,707 --> 01:24:44,375
And beer
is not much better.

796
01:24:44,459 --> 01:24:46,919
It's slower and cheaper.
No!

797
01:25:10,485 --> 01:25:13,070
So take these
words of advice.

798
01:25:13,154 --> 01:25:17,491
And remember, you heard
them from a poor sinner

799
01:25:17,575 --> 01:25:20,411
got no more cause to lie,

800
01:25:20,954 --> 01:25:23,748
'cause he's going
to meet his Maker.

801
01:25:24,375 --> 01:25:26,543
And now he's ready.

802
01:25:27,712 --> 01:25:29,713
Well, that's all
I've got to say.

803
01:25:38,389 --> 01:25:41,599
Will you all bow your heads
in one final prayer?

804
01:25:50,192 --> 01:25:53,820
May God have mercy
on their poor souls,

805
01:25:53,904 --> 01:25:58,408
as he has upon
all the faithful departed.

806
01:25:59,368 --> 01:26:00,368
Amen.

807
01:26:00,453 --> 01:26:02,454
Amen.
Amen.

808
01:27:36,341 --> 01:27:38,342
Dear God!

809
01:27:44,850 --> 01:27:47,601
All right, all right,
I'm coming!

810
01:27:49,729 --> 01:27:50,896
Judge Fenton.

811
01:27:50,981 --> 01:27:53,107
I come to praise Sophie,
not to close her down.

812
01:27:53,191 --> 01:27:54,275
I thought maybe
you came to...

813
01:27:54,359 --> 01:27:56,318
Now, Sophie.
Now, now, now.

814
01:27:56,403 --> 01:27:58,821
Well, now at least I know what
it takes to get you in here.

815
01:27:59,948 --> 01:28:01,407
How is he this morning?

816
01:28:01,491 --> 01:28:04,160
I've never seen a man
who has more right to be dead.

817
01:28:04,244 --> 01:28:06,203
I gotta see him right now,
Sophie. Can't wait any longer.

818
01:28:06,288 --> 01:28:09,039
Check with Rachel.
She's still in charge.

819
01:28:12,210 --> 01:28:13,836
She stayed all night?

820
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:17,339
You heard, Doc. If Rachel
hadn't stopped the bleeding...

821
01:28:17,424 --> 01:28:18,841
As it was, somebody
had to stay with him.

822
01:28:18,925 --> 01:28:21,802
A couple of my girls volunteered.
Rachel wouldn't have it.

823
01:28:21,887 --> 01:28:24,471
Same room. Honeymoon suite,
at the head of the stairs.

824
01:28:24,556 --> 01:28:25,764
Thanks, Sophie.

825
01:28:25,891 --> 01:28:27,434
Good morning, Judge.
Good morning, dear.

826
01:28:27,476 --> 01:28:30,729
Anything I can do for you? No,
no. No, no. Thank you, dear.

827
01:28:38,821 --> 01:28:41,615
It's all right, Judge.
I'm just about finishing up.

828
01:28:46,621 --> 01:28:49,080
I heard about what you
did, Rachel. I'm grateful.

829
01:28:49,916 --> 01:28:51,541
Why don't you sit down?

830
01:28:54,754 --> 01:28:57,422
Can I get you something?
No, no, thank you.

831
01:28:57,506 --> 01:29:00,550
I shouldn't have done this.
I may never get up again!

832
01:29:11,604 --> 01:29:13,271
Who did it, Jed?

833
01:29:17,401 --> 01:29:21,780
Much as you want them, Jed,
I want them more. I need them!

834
01:29:25,534 --> 01:29:30,080
It's bad enough when a deputy gets
bushwhacked on some lonely trail,

835
01:29:30,164 --> 01:29:35,335
but here, in Fort Grant,
broad daylight?

836
01:29:36,837 --> 01:29:39,089
We can't let them
get away with that.

837
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,591
Now, who did it?

838
01:29:43,761 --> 01:29:47,097
I'll go after them myself.

839
01:29:48,099 --> 01:29:50,100
For the love of God, son!

840
01:29:50,184 --> 01:29:52,394
God's got nothing
to do with it.

841
01:29:53,771 --> 01:29:55,480
I'll take care of them.

842
01:30:10,664 --> 01:30:12,373
Want me to take over?

843
01:30:12,457 --> 01:30:13,958
No.

844
01:30:15,210 --> 01:30:16,627
Thank you.

845
01:30:16,712 --> 01:30:18,212
You could use
a good night's sleep.

846
01:30:22,884 --> 01:30:26,470
All right, honey, but one of
these days he's gonna get better,

847
01:30:26,555 --> 01:30:29,223
and you're gonna have
a man on your hands.

848
01:31:47,595 --> 01:31:49,596
You're perspiring.

849
01:31:52,433 --> 01:31:54,434
Don't drink your
milk so fast.

850
01:32:05,905 --> 01:32:08,365
You look tired.
Are you all right?

851
01:32:11,786 --> 01:32:13,787
You know you're a nag?

852
01:32:16,165 --> 01:32:18,166
A very pretty one,
but a nag.

853
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:35,600
What was that for?

854
01:32:35,685 --> 01:32:37,102
Just thanks.

855
01:32:39,522 --> 01:32:40,856
You're welcome.

856
01:32:44,861 --> 01:32:46,987
I'll get some
salt for the eggs.

857
01:32:47,071 --> 01:32:48,363
Forget the salt.

858
01:32:52,076 --> 01:32:53,702
Please.

859
01:32:54,245 --> 01:32:56,204
Please don't.

860
01:32:57,123 --> 01:32:59,166
Yeah, well, I guess...

861
01:32:59,625 --> 01:33:02,879
I guess my life isn't
worth two kisses, huh?

862
01:33:12,723 --> 01:33:14,307
Please.

863
01:33:15,559 --> 01:33:17,143
I'm sorry.

864
01:33:28,363 --> 01:33:29,989
What's the matter?

865
01:33:37,164 --> 01:33:39,582
I was married,
back in Denver.

866
01:33:41,793 --> 01:33:43,669
His name was Paul.

867
01:33:43,754 --> 01:33:46,756
He was a doctor
and a very fine man.

868
01:33:48,133 --> 01:33:50,426
He used to say
this was his place,

869
01:33:51,803 --> 01:33:54,597
this was where
doctors were needed.

870
01:33:57,267 --> 01:34:01,020
One night, after we'd camped,

871
01:34:01,104 --> 01:34:03,940
we sat around
the fire, talking,

872
01:34:04,024 --> 01:34:06,192
husband and wife talk

873
01:34:06,276 --> 01:34:09,445
about how many children
we were going to have,

874
01:34:10,864 --> 01:34:14,075
and what a wonderful life we
were going to have together.

875
01:34:19,122 --> 01:34:21,123
And then they came.

876
01:34:23,293 --> 01:34:25,628
Two men on horseback.

877
01:34:26,547 --> 01:34:28,005
Just some food.

878
01:34:29,633 --> 01:34:33,052
Just to share our food,
that's all they wanted.

879
01:34:35,348 --> 01:34:37,349
And one of them

880
01:34:39,143 --> 01:34:41,311
put his hand on me.

881
01:34:44,107 --> 01:34:46,108
And there was a shot.

882
01:34:47,819 --> 01:34:49,611
And Paul was dead.

883
01:34:52,323 --> 01:34:55,993
And they just left him there lying
beside me on the ground, dead.

884
01:35:00,331 --> 01:35:03,125
And they took me.

885
01:35:06,087 --> 01:35:09,464
And took me.
And took me!

886
01:35:29,569 --> 01:35:31,570
The tumbleweed wagon?

887
01:35:32,530 --> 01:35:36,033
The jail? You're
looking for those men?

888
01:35:42,874 --> 01:35:45,042
And what happens
when you find them?

889
01:35:50,548 --> 01:35:52,549
Or if you don't find them?

890
01:35:57,889 --> 01:35:58,972
Ever?

891
01:36:09,568 --> 01:36:11,903
We'd better hurry!
It's gonna storm!

892
01:39:40,114 --> 01:39:43,199
Miss Rachel, where do you
want to put these blankets?

893
01:39:43,617 --> 01:39:44,617
What is it, Marvin?

894
01:39:44,702 --> 01:39:46,286
Where do you
want these blankets?

895
01:39:46,370 --> 01:39:48,329
Just put them
in the back someplace.

896
01:39:48,414 --> 01:39:49,455
Yes, ma'am.

897
01:39:59,633 --> 01:40:01,384
Hi, Marshal!

898
01:40:24,074 --> 01:40:27,160
You asked me once whether
I could ever stop looking.

899
01:40:27,536 --> 01:40:29,579
I think now I can.

900
01:40:30,039 --> 01:40:31,706
Can you?

901
01:40:31,999 --> 01:40:34,000
Well, Rachel,
there's a difference.

902
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:37,587
You see, I'm not...
I'm not looking for ghosts.

903
01:40:38,339 --> 01:40:40,590
The end of my trail's
in Red Creek.

904
01:40:41,300 --> 01:40:42,843
Maybe not.

905
01:40:43,637 --> 01:40:45,137
What then?

906
01:40:46,723 --> 01:40:48,223
I don't know.

907
01:42:32,413 --> 01:42:33,913
Think we got him?

908
01:42:33,998 --> 01:42:35,957
I don't know.

909
01:42:36,042 --> 01:42:38,543
The dog or the shot,
either one.

910
01:43:02,109 --> 01:43:05,278
Why ain't that
dog yapping?

911
01:43:05,362 --> 01:43:07,697
If that marshal was alive that
dog would be yapping, wouldn't he?

912
01:43:07,782 --> 01:43:09,783
I told you I didn't know!

913
01:43:14,163 --> 01:43:15,830
But I aim
to find out.

914
01:43:19,877 --> 01:43:22,295
No! Let him come to us.

915
01:43:22,379 --> 01:43:25,381
No, Captain. I've waited
on him long enough.

916
01:43:32,890 --> 01:43:34,224
Why don't he move?

917
01:44:03,171 --> 01:44:04,713
Tommy!

918
01:45:06,943 --> 01:45:08,319
Drop it.

919
01:48:25,645 --> 01:48:31,066
Dead. Captain Wilson, Tommy,

920
01:48:31,150 --> 01:48:36,071
Loomis, all of them, dead.

921
01:48:36,614 --> 01:48:40,992
All except Maddow, Blackfoot,
and you, Jenkins.

922
01:48:42,328 --> 01:48:44,287
Count me dead, too.

923
01:48:47,792 --> 01:48:52,003
I just want to say that
I don't hold you to blame,

924
01:48:52,088 --> 01:48:53,797
for what that's worth.

925
01:48:55,591 --> 01:48:57,134
It's worth something.

926
01:49:13,860 --> 01:49:15,861
So that's how it is?

927
01:49:16,863 --> 01:49:20,532
That Rachel lit a fire in you
with that rich body of hers.

928
01:49:20,616 --> 01:49:22,492
You lit a fire
in each other.

929
01:49:22,577 --> 01:49:25,370
Now you're going to get married
and raise cattle and kids.

930
01:49:25,455 --> 01:49:27,038
Devil take
the rest of the world.

931
01:49:27,123 --> 01:49:28,123
Maybe.

932
01:49:28,207 --> 01:49:32,544
You used the law and a badge
to heal that scar on your neck.

933
01:49:32,628 --> 01:49:35,464
Well, how many men are you going
to have to hang to heal your scar?

934
01:49:35,548 --> 01:49:36,548
Go to hell, Cooper.

935
01:49:36,632 --> 01:49:38,300
I've already been
there, Judge,

936
01:49:38,384 --> 01:49:41,636
in your wagon and in
that hole you call a jail.

937
01:49:41,721 --> 01:49:43,638
And old man Jenkins
is gonna die there.

938
01:49:43,723 --> 01:49:45,932
Is he sick?
He's dying.

939
01:49:46,017 --> 01:49:47,642
I'll get a doctor
down there for him.

940
01:49:47,727 --> 01:49:48,935
Let him go!

941
01:49:49,020 --> 01:49:51,188
So he can go on and look for
another innocent man to lynch?

942
01:49:51,272 --> 01:49:53,064
He's an old man.

943
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:56,819
Well!

944
01:49:57,738 --> 01:50:00,198
And that was an old rope he
helped put around your neck,

945
01:50:00,282 --> 01:50:02,533
but it came damn near
to killing you, didn't it?

946
01:50:03,243 --> 01:50:06,078
What's the matter
with you, Cooper?

947
01:50:06,163 --> 01:50:08,706
You got Jenkins
on your conscience?

948
01:50:08,790 --> 01:50:10,833
Think I judged him
too harshly,

949
01:50:10,918 --> 01:50:14,629
used him like a piece of
kindling for my fire of justice?

950
01:50:14,713 --> 01:50:18,341
Well, maybe that's inevitable when
there's only one man, one court

951
01:50:18,425 --> 01:50:20,009
with the power
of final justice

952
01:50:20,093 --> 01:50:24,680
over a territory five times
the size of most states!

953
01:50:24,765 --> 01:50:28,851
Mistakes? I've made them,
Cooper, don't you doubt it.

954
01:50:28,936 --> 01:50:31,687
Don't you doubt either there are times
sitting up there in that judgment seat

955
01:50:31,772 --> 01:50:33,940
I've wished, I have prayed

956
01:50:34,024 --> 01:50:38,402
that there was someone standing
between me and God almighty,

957
01:50:38,779 --> 01:50:39,987
someone with
the power to say,

958
01:50:40,072 --> 01:50:42,406
"You're wrong, Fenton.
You made a mistake in law.

959
01:50:42,491 --> 01:50:45,201
"This man here
deserves another trial,

960
01:50:45,285 --> 01:50:48,621
"this man here a reprieve,
and this man is innocent!"

961
01:50:52,292 --> 01:50:55,378
But until this territory
becomes a state,

962
01:50:55,462 --> 01:50:58,548
with a governor and a
state court of appeals,

963
01:50:58,632 --> 01:51:02,218
I'm the law here,
all the law.

964
01:51:02,636 --> 01:51:06,305
And if you don't like that, you
can cuss me till hell freezes over.

965
01:51:07,099 --> 01:51:09,392
Or you can join me, Cooper.

966
01:51:09,476 --> 01:51:10,685
Even fight me!

967
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:14,397
Help me turn this godforsaken
territory into a state

968
01:51:14,481 --> 01:51:17,525
where no one man
calls himself the law.

969
01:51:17,609 --> 01:51:19,860
I want that old
man pardoned.

970
01:51:19,945 --> 01:51:21,320
You pick up your badge.

971
01:51:21,405 --> 01:51:23,197
Tonight. Right now.

972
01:51:30,748 --> 01:51:33,125
You take this down.

973
01:51:33,209 --> 01:51:35,377
Give it to one of
the guards down there.

974
01:51:35,670 --> 01:51:38,422
If there are any questions,
you tell them to see me.

975
01:51:38,506 --> 01:51:40,257
There'll be no questions.

976
01:52:04,574 --> 01:52:06,116
Cooper?

977
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:09,244
Charlie Blackfoot was seen
in the town of Ridgeway.

978
01:52:09,537 --> 01:52:12,080
I got two unfilled
warrants here.

979
01:52:12,415 --> 01:52:15,500
Blackfoot and Maddow.
The law still wants them.
