1
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,305
We're just about ready
to go here.

2
00:04:59,344 --> 00:05:00,359
Good.

3
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,247
I'm looking for James.
Has anybody seen James Ballard?

4
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,444
Do you know who I mean?
The producer of this epic?

5
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,269
I think I saw him
in the camera room.

6
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,400
James, are you in there?

7
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,189
Can we get your stamp of
approval on our steadicam shot?

8
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,373
Of course.

9
00:05:30,511 --> 00:05:32,365
Be there in a minute.

10
00:05:42,414 --> 00:05:44,039
Where were you?

11
00:05:46,574 --> 00:05:48,679
In a private aircraft hangar.

12
00:05:51,213 --> 00:05:53,515
Anyone could've walked in.

13
00:05:54,926 --> 00:05:56,682
Did you come?

14
00:05:58,285 --> 00:05:59,234
No.

15
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:07,878
What about your camera girl?
Did she come?

16
00:06:22,604 --> 00:06:24,514
We were interrupted.

17
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:32,288
I had to go back to the set.

18
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:36,386
Poor darling.

19
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:43,237
Maybe the next one.

20
00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:47,717
Maybe the next one.

21
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,090
Shit.

22
00:08:56,485 --> 00:08:58,394
Not a lot of action here.

23
00:09:00,324 --> 00:09:03,521
Have you considered this
would be the airport hospital?

24
00:09:05,605 --> 00:09:08,158
This ward is reserved
for air crash victims.

25
00:09:10,564 --> 00:09:12,352
The beds are kept waiting.

26
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,609
Well, if I ground it during
my flying lesson Saturday...

27
00:09:15,652 --> 00:09:18,074
you might wake up
and find me next to you.

28
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:22,239
You're getting out of bed soon.

29
00:09:23,715 --> 00:09:25,471
They want you to walk.

30
00:09:32,675 --> 00:09:34,431
The other man, the dead man?

31
00:09:35,395 --> 00:09:36,824
His wife's a doctor.

32
00:09:38,115 --> 00:09:40,154
Dr. Helen Remington.

33
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:43,610
She's here somewhere...
as a patient, of course.

34
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:47,161
Maybe you'll find her
in the hallways...

35
00:09:47,202 --> 00:09:48,828
during one of your walks.

36
00:09:50,434 --> 00:09:52,222
And her husband, what was he?

37
00:09:55,074 --> 00:09:57,660
A chemical engineer
for a food company.

38
00:10:01,218 --> 00:10:03,389
Where's-where's the car?

39
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:07,286
Outside, in the visitors
car park.

40
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:08,507
What?

41
00:10:10,817 --> 00:10:12,475
They brought the car here?

42
00:10:12,513 --> 00:10:15,033
My car. Not yours.

43
00:10:18,305 --> 00:10:20,476
Yours is a complete wreck.

44
00:10:20,513 --> 00:10:23,295
Police had to drag it
to the pound.

45
00:10:23,328 --> 00:10:25,565
It's behind the station.

46
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,182
After being bombarded
endlessly...

47
00:10:29,217 --> 00:10:31,256
by road safety propaganda,
it's...

48
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,098
almost a relief to have...

49
00:10:36,576 --> 00:10:38,714
found myself
in an actual accident.

50
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,340
Dr. Remington?

51
00:11:32,861 --> 00:11:33,810
James Ballard?

52
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,339
Yes.

53
00:11:56,989 --> 00:11:57,971
Crash victim?

54
00:11:58,012 --> 00:12:00,216
Yes. I'd-

55
00:12:24,891 --> 00:12:26,800
We'll deal with these later.

56
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,253
Both of the front wheels
of their car and the engine...

57
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,039
were driven back
into the driver's section,

58
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:56,114
pulling the floor.

59
00:12:58,841 --> 00:13:00,215
Blood still marked the hood...

60
00:13:00,249 --> 00:13:02,704
like little streamers
of black lace...

61
00:13:02,745 --> 00:13:05,363
running towards
the windshield wiper gutters.

62
00:13:06,457 --> 00:13:08,759
Bloody flecks were spattered...

63
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:11,214
across the seat
and steering wheel.

64
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:19,763
And the instrument panel
was buckled inwards...

65
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,549
cracking the clock
and speedometer dials.

66
00:13:25,688 --> 00:13:28,273
The cabin was deformed.

67
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,884
And there was dust and glass...

68
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,669
and plastic flakes
everywhere inside.

69
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,305
The carpeting was damp.

70
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:45,356
It stank of blood and other body
and machine fluids.

71
00:14:10,102 --> 00:14:12,371
You should've gone
to the funeral.

72
00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:14,672
I wish I had.

73
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:19,025
They bury the dead so quickly.

74
00:14:20,789 --> 00:14:23,407
They should leave them
lying around for months.

75
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:27,792
What about his wife?
The woman doctor?

76
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:29,684
Have you been to visit her yet?

77
00:14:31,348 --> 00:14:32,363
No.

78
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:35,886
I couldn't.

79
00:14:39,988 --> 00:14:41,897
I feel too close to her.

80
00:15:13,586 --> 00:15:16,685
I don't like the idea of
your getting into a car so soon.

81
00:15:17,586 --> 00:15:19,048
I can't sit
on this balcony forever.

82
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,294
I feel like a potted plant.

83
00:15:23,442 --> 00:15:25,351
How can you drive, James?

84
00:15:27,282 --> 00:15:29,104
You can barely walk.

85
00:15:31,634 --> 00:15:33,543
Is traffic heavier now?

86
00:15:36,113 --> 00:15:38,218
There seem to be
three times as many cars...

87
00:15:38,258 --> 00:15:40,396
as there were
before the accident.

88
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:44,455
I have to leave for work.

89
00:18:17,034 --> 00:18:18,594
After this sort of thing...

90
00:18:18,634 --> 00:18:20,674
how do people manage
to look at a car...

91
00:18:20,714 --> 00:18:22,143
let alone drive one?

92
00:18:30,473 --> 00:18:32,709
I'm trying to find Charles' car.

93
00:18:35,273 --> 00:18:37,215
It's not here.

94
00:18:37,257 --> 00:18:39,591
Maybe the police
are still holding it.

95
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,472
They said it was here.
They told me this morning.

96
00:18:53,192 --> 00:18:55,080
This is your car?

97
00:19:11,271 --> 00:19:13,159
You might tear your glove.

98
00:19:19,623 --> 00:19:22,590
I never should've come here.

99
00:19:22,631 --> 00:19:25,052
I'm surprised the police
don't make it more difficult.

100
00:19:26,183 --> 00:19:27,590
Were you badly hurt?

101
00:19:27,622 --> 00:19:29,989
I think we saw each other
at the hospital.

102
00:19:30,023 --> 00:19:31,965
I don't want the car.

103
00:19:32,614 --> 00:19:34,021
In fact,
I was appalled to find...

104
00:19:34,054 --> 00:19:36,989
that I have to pay
to have it scrapped.

105
00:19:39,142 --> 00:19:40,898
Can I give you a lift?

106
00:19:42,662 --> 00:19:45,150
I somehow find myself
driving again.

107
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,996
You haven't told me
where we're going.

108
00:19:56,037 --> 00:19:57,215
I haven't?

109
00:19:58,757 --> 00:20:00,513
To the airport,
if you don't mind.

110
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:01,793
The airport?

111
00:20:01,829 --> 00:20:03,519
Why? Are you leaving?

112
00:20:03,557 --> 00:20:04,833
Not yet.

113
00:20:05,797 --> 00:20:07,869
Though not soon enough
for some people.

114
00:20:08,357 --> 00:20:12,513
A death in the doctor's family
makes the patients uneasy.

115
00:20:12,548 --> 00:20:14,817
I take it you're not wearing
white to reassure them.

116
00:20:14,852 --> 00:20:17,786
I'll wear a fucking kimono
if I want to.

117
00:20:27,012 --> 00:20:28,921
So why the airport?

118
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:31,803
I work in
the Immigration Department.

119
00:20:34,211 --> 00:20:35,705
Do you want a cigarette?

120
00:20:35,747 --> 00:20:36,860
No.

121
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:40,738
I started to smoke
at the hospital.

122
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:44,318
It's kind of stupid.

123
00:20:53,858 --> 00:20:56,411
Look at all this traffic.

124
00:21:00,034 --> 00:21:01,244
I'm not sure I can deal with it.

125
00:21:01,283 --> 00:21:03,584
It's much worse now.
Have you noticed that?

126
00:21:03,618 --> 00:21:04,632
Yes.

127
00:21:12,449 --> 00:21:14,358
The day I left the hospital...

128
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:19,417
I had the extraordinary
feeling that all these cars...

129
00:21:19,457 --> 00:21:21,846
were gathering
for some special reason...

130
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:23,264
I didn't understand.

131
00:21:25,089 --> 00:21:28,983
There seemed to be
ten times as much traffic.

132
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,934
Are we imagining it?

133
00:21:42,112 --> 00:21:44,981
You've bought yourself
exactly the same car again.

134
00:21:46,528 --> 00:21:48,949
It's the same shape and color.

135
00:22:12,767 --> 00:22:14,839
We're close
to the airport garage.

136
00:22:15,487 --> 00:22:17,723
It won't be busy
this time of day.

137
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:50,894
"Don't worry.
That guy's gotta see us."

138
00:24:54,423 --> 00:24:57,140
"Don't worry.
That guy's gotta see us."

139
00:25:01,623 --> 00:25:03,663
These were
the confident last words...

140
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:07,215
of the brilliant, young
Hollywood star James Dean...

141
00:25:08,662 --> 00:25:12,459
as he piloted his Porsche
550 Spyder race car...

142
00:25:12,502 --> 00:25:15,502
toward a date with death...

143
00:25:15,542 --> 00:25:17,582
along a lonely stretch...

144
00:25:17,622 --> 00:25:20,305
of California
two-lane blacktop...

145
00:25:20,342 --> 00:25:22,447
Route 466.

146
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:29,482
"Don't worry.
That guy's gotta see us."

147
00:25:36,181 --> 00:25:39,149
The year... 1955.

148
00:25:40,597 --> 00:25:43,215
The day... September 30.

149
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:46,188
The time...

150
00:25:47,956 --> 00:25:49,679
Now.

151
00:25:53,461 --> 00:25:57,421
The first star of our show
is "Little Bastard."

152
00:25:58,484 --> 00:26:00,589
James Dean's racing Porsche.

153
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,213
He named it after himself...

154
00:26:03,252 --> 00:26:06,994
and had his racing number-
130-painted on it.

155
00:26:09,172 --> 00:26:11,114
Who is that, the announcer?
Do I know him?

156
00:26:11,155 --> 00:26:12,562
Here behind the seats was...

157
00:26:12,595 --> 00:26:16,719
a very sophisticated air-cooled
four-cylinder racing engine.

158
00:26:16,755 --> 00:26:20,333
That's Vaughan.
He spoke to you at the hospital.

159
00:26:23,827 --> 00:26:25,453
I thought he was
a medical photographer...

160
00:26:28,563 --> 00:26:30,057
doing some sort of
accident research.

161
00:26:30,098 --> 00:26:32,945
He wanted every conceivable
detail about our crash.

162
00:26:32,978 --> 00:26:36,294
Body-light,
no more than 1,350 pounds.

163
00:26:36,338 --> 00:26:39,437
It was nimble.
It was responsive.

164
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:41,710
When I first met Vaughan,
he was a specialist...

165
00:26:41,746 --> 00:26:43,753
in international
computerized traffic systems.

166
00:26:43,793 --> 00:26:45,681
The racers of the day...

167
00:26:45,713 --> 00:26:48,561
said that it was not
an easy car to drive fast.

168
00:26:48,593 --> 00:26:50,480
I don't know what he is now.

169
00:26:50,513 --> 00:26:53,360
Which brings us
to the second star...

170
00:26:53,393 --> 00:26:57,354
a stunt man, former
race driver Colin Seagrave.

171
00:26:57,393 --> 00:26:58,822
Colin Seagrave.

172
00:27:00,177 --> 00:27:03,144
He will drive our replica
of James Dean's car.

173
00:27:07,632 --> 00:27:09,737
How you doing?
Sure you're up for this?

174
00:27:10,736 --> 00:27:13,038
You bet.

175
00:27:13,072 --> 00:27:16,553
I myself shall play the role
of Dean's racing mechanic...

176
00:27:16,592 --> 00:27:19,908
Rolf Voudrich, sent over
from the Porsche factory...

177
00:27:19,952 --> 00:27:21,513
in Zuffenhausen, Germany.

178
00:27:21,552 --> 00:27:24,235
Now, this mechanic
was himself fated to die...

179
00:27:24,272 --> 00:27:27,468
in a car crash in Germany
26 years later.

180
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:31,239
The third,
and in some ways...

181
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:35,302
most important player...

182
00:27:35,343 --> 00:27:38,987
the college student,
Donald Turnipseed...

183
00:27:39,023 --> 00:27:42,318
played by movie stunt man
Brett Trask.

184
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:46,477
Brett Trask.

185
00:27:51,823 --> 00:27:56,492
Turnipseed was on his way home
to Fresno for the weekend.

186
00:27:56,526 --> 00:28:00,171
James Dean was on his way to
an automobile race in Salinas.

187
00:28:01,422 --> 00:28:04,455
Salinas was just a dusty town
in Northern California.

188
00:28:05,741 --> 00:28:09,702
The two would meet
for one moment.

189
00:28:09,741 --> 00:28:13,124
But it was a moment that...

190
00:28:14,093 --> 00:28:16,614
that would create
a Hollywood legend.

191
00:28:18,669 --> 00:28:20,807
You'll notice that
we're not wearing helmets...

192
00:28:20,845 --> 00:28:22,950
or safety padding of any kind.

193
00:28:22,989 --> 00:28:26,305
Our cars are not equipped
with roll cages or seat belts.

194
00:28:26,348 --> 00:28:31,105
We rely solely on the skill
of our drivers for our safety...

195
00:28:31,148 --> 00:28:35,010
so that we can bring you
the ultimate in authenticity.

196
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,368
All right.

197
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,112
Here we go-
the fatal crash of James Dean.

198
00:28:51,371 --> 00:28:52,615
OK, let's wind her up.

199
00:29:09,611 --> 00:29:10,559
Go.

200
00:30:06,344 --> 00:30:08,580
Is this part of the act,
or are they really hurt?

201
00:30:08,616 --> 00:30:10,022
I don't know.

202
00:30:10,056 --> 00:30:12,445
You can never
be sure with Vaughan.

203
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:15,325
This is his show.

204
00:30:19,016 --> 00:30:21,699
Rolf Voudrich...

205
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:24,452
was thrown from the Porsche...

206
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:27,070
and spent a year...

207
00:30:28,711 --> 00:30:30,140
in the hospital...

208
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:36,387
recovering from his injuries.

209
00:30:45,031 --> 00:30:48,827
Donald Turnipseed
was found wandering around...

210
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,943
in a daze but basically unhurt.

211
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:55,237
James Dean
died of a broken neck...

212
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,179
and became immortal.

213
00:31:04,293 --> 00:31:05,722
What's the matter?

214
00:31:06,885 --> 00:31:10,529
Hold me up. I'm dizzy.
I can't stand.

215
00:31:10,565 --> 00:31:12,932
I know that man-Seagrave.

216
00:31:12,965 --> 00:31:14,874
I think he's genuinely hurt.

217
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:24,382
Disperse at once.

218
00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:33,212
You're all liable for fines
or arrest.

219
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:38,238
Disperse at once.

220
00:31:43,076 --> 00:31:44,963
- How you doin'?
- I'm all right.

221
00:31:46,403 --> 00:31:47,680
What's the matter with Seagrave?

222
00:31:47,715 --> 00:31:51,774
He hit his head, I think.
His balance is off.

223
00:31:54,819 --> 00:31:57,502
Why are the police
taking this so seriously?

224
00:31:57,538 --> 00:31:59,393
No, it's not the police.

225
00:31:59,426 --> 00:32:02,296
It's the Department
of Transport.

226
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:03,745
It's a big joke.

227
00:32:03,778 --> 00:32:06,648
They have no idea
who we really are.

228
00:32:20,993 --> 00:32:22,302
Was I glib?

229
00:32:23,713 --> 00:32:27,062
"James Dean died of a broken
neck and became immortal."

230
00:32:32,673 --> 00:32:34,102
I couldn't resist.

231
00:33:14,047 --> 00:33:15,454
Oh, God.

232
00:33:15,487 --> 00:33:17,429
What happened?

233
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:20,504
Come here. Lie down.

234
00:33:20,543 --> 00:33:22,965
They did the James Dean crash.

235
00:33:23,007 --> 00:33:25,243
It seemed to go perfectly,
but then...

236
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,645
he started to feel nauseous
on the way back.

237
00:33:27,678 --> 00:33:29,914
I'm sure it's a concussion.

238
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:33,266
Well, we're familiar enough
with that then, aren't we?

239
00:34:17,468 --> 00:34:18,995
Seagrave.

240
00:34:24,156 --> 00:34:26,065
Seagrave,
I really would like to...

241
00:34:27,355 --> 00:34:29,460
work out the details...

242
00:34:30,204 --> 00:34:33,749
of the Jayne Mansfield
crash with you.

243
00:34:41,403 --> 00:34:42,744
We could...

244
00:34:44,635 --> 00:34:47,983
We could do the...
the decapitation.

245
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:52,560
The head embedded
in the windshield.

246
00:34:52,603 --> 00:34:55,864
The world record is
a whopping forty-two pounds.

247
00:34:55,898 --> 00:34:58,287
And the dead dog thing,
you know?

248
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,176
You know, the Chihuahua
in the back seat?

249
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,119
I got it all worked out.

250
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:14,318
I'll be ready, Vaughan.

251
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:16,849
I want really big tits.

252
00:35:18,777 --> 00:35:20,206
Out to here.

253
00:35:22,457 --> 00:35:24,726
So the audience can see 'em
get all cut up...

254
00:35:24,761 --> 00:35:26,997
and crushed on the dashboard.

255
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:33,489
Yeah, we'll do that.

256
00:35:33,528 --> 00:35:35,470
Ballard...

257
00:35:35,512 --> 00:35:37,454
I need your help.

258
00:36:01,751 --> 00:36:03,474
Do you live here with Seagrave?

259
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:06,194
No. I live in my car.
This is my workshop.

260
00:36:25,526 --> 00:36:27,435
This is my new project.

261
00:36:48,564 --> 00:36:50,223
You recognize her?

262
00:36:51,925 --> 00:36:53,169
That's Gabrielle.

263
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,194
That's her right outside
the door there.

264
00:37:44,018 --> 00:37:46,385
I thought you might be
missing these.

265
00:37:52,146 --> 00:37:53,094
Right.

266
00:37:57,489 --> 00:37:59,758
So here you are
at the nerve center.

267
00:38:04,338 --> 00:38:07,403
Vaughan makes everything
look like a crime, doesn't he?

268
00:38:26,896 --> 00:38:29,001
What exactly
is your project, Vaughan?

269
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,974
Book of car crashes?

270
00:38:36,816 --> 00:38:38,092
Medical study?

271
00:38:39,536 --> 00:38:41,259
Sensational documentary?

272
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,565
Global traffic?

273
00:38:47,695 --> 00:38:50,182
It's something...

274
00:38:50,223 --> 00:38:54,379
we are all intimately
involved in.

275
00:38:56,911 --> 00:39:00,871
The reshaping of the human body
by modern technology.

276
00:39:06,862 --> 00:39:07,877
Nothing.

277
00:39:07,918 --> 00:39:09,958
It's a Sunday, man.

278
00:39:09,998 --> 00:39:11,525
She's desperate.

279
00:39:11,566 --> 00:39:13,257
No, I'm not.

280
00:39:16,078 --> 00:39:18,217
The length?

281
00:39:18,254 --> 00:39:20,556
'Cause I'm not gonna
hold the sets that long.

282
00:42:14,182 --> 00:42:18,404
He must have fucked a lot of
women in that huge car of his.

283
00:42:19,365 --> 00:42:21,754
It's like a bed on wheels.

284
00:42:23,269 --> 00:42:25,341
It must smell of semen.

285
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:30,144
It does.

286
00:42:34,564 --> 00:42:36,637
Do you find him attractive?

287
00:42:37,444 --> 00:42:39,648
He's very pale.

288
00:42:41,667 --> 00:42:43,904
Covered with scars.

289
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,915
Would you like
to fuck him, though...

290
00:42:45,956 --> 00:42:48,127
in that car?

291
00:42:49,955 --> 00:42:52,955
No.

292
00:42:52,995 --> 00:42:54,686
But...

293
00:42:54,723 --> 00:42:57,276
But when he's in that car...

294
00:43:00,515 --> 00:43:02,784
Have you seen his penis?

295
00:43:06,882 --> 00:43:09,533
I think it's badly scarred...

296
00:43:12,802 --> 00:43:14,525
from a motorcycle accident.

297
00:43:18,978 --> 00:43:20,985
Is he circumcised?

298
00:43:22,498 --> 00:43:25,247
Can you imagine
what his anus looks like?

299
00:43:25,282 --> 00:43:27,289
Describe it to me.

300
00:43:32,449 --> 00:43:34,718
Would you like to sodomize him?

301
00:43:37,665 --> 00:43:41,277
Would you like to put your penis
right into his anus?

302
00:43:41,313 --> 00:43:43,452
Just thrust it up his anus?

303
00:43:43,489 --> 00:43:45,278
Tell me.

304
00:43:45,313 --> 00:43:47,801
Describe it to me.

305
00:43:48,768 --> 00:43:51,135
Tell me what you would do.

306
00:43:51,169 --> 00:43:55,424
Could you just kiss him
in that car?

307
00:43:57,056 --> 00:44:00,733
Describe how you reach over.

308
00:44:00,768 --> 00:44:03,256
Unzip his greasy jeans.

309
00:44:03,776 --> 00:44:05,815
Take out his penis.

310
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,444
Would you kiss it
or suck it right away?

311
00:44:13,279 --> 00:44:14,556
Which hand would you...

312
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,109
Which hand
would you hold it in?

313
00:44:22,015 --> 00:44:24,568
Have you ever sucked a penis?

314
00:44:26,815 --> 00:44:30,076
Do you know
what semen tastes like?

315
00:44:30,111 --> 00:44:33,689
Have you ever tasted semen?

316
00:44:34,654 --> 00:44:38,582
Some semen
is saltier than others.

317
00:44:48,414 --> 00:44:53,018
Vaughan's semen
must be very salty.

318
00:45:29,788 --> 00:45:31,959
Have you come?

319
00:45:34,748 --> 00:45:36,209
I'm all right.

320
00:45:56,794 --> 00:45:58,223
Finish your story.

321
00:46:01,114 --> 00:46:05,489
The junior pathologist
at Ashford Hospital...

322
00:46:06,362 --> 00:46:09,526
then the husband
of a colleague of mine.

323
00:46:15,514 --> 00:46:17,619
A trainee radiologist...

324
00:46:18,362 --> 00:46:22,388
then the service manager
at my garage.

325
00:46:24,633 --> 00:46:26,520
You had sex
with all those men in cars?

326
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:29,138
Only in cars?

327
00:46:30,393 --> 00:46:33,426
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.

328
00:46:37,433 --> 00:46:40,280
Did you fantasize that Vaughan
was photographing...

329
00:46:40,312 --> 00:46:44,273
all these sex acts as though
they were traffic accidents?

330
00:46:44,312 --> 00:46:45,774
Yes.

331
00:46:49,048 --> 00:46:51,153
They felt
like traffic accidents.

332
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:44,587
Now...

333
00:47:47,061 --> 00:47:50,771
We must accumulate
all the paper we can about her.

334
00:47:50,805 --> 00:47:54,067
Some of the stuff that Helen
brought back is terrific...

335
00:47:54,101 --> 00:47:56,971
tolerances of the human face
in crash impacts...

336
00:47:57,013 --> 00:47:58,125
mechanisms of...

337
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:05,737
Now, where is the...

338
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:09,806
I'm sure we see this again
in slow motion.

339
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:11,852
Closer, I mean...

340
00:48:11,892 --> 00:48:14,444
in detail.

341
00:48:14,484 --> 00:48:17,615
We can watch another tape.
We brought lots of tapes.

342
00:48:17,651 --> 00:48:21,132
No. I-I know this tape.
I know this tape.

343
00:48:21,172 --> 00:48:24,074
That tape player's fucked.
That's what it is.

344
00:48:24,116 --> 00:48:25,872
It always does that.

345
00:48:25,907 --> 00:48:27,947
It always does that.

346
00:48:50,418 --> 00:48:52,207
You're upset.

347
00:48:52,242 --> 00:48:55,090
No. I'm all right.

348
00:48:56,946 --> 00:48:59,280
I'm all right now.

349
00:49:17,617 --> 00:49:19,624
I've always wanted
to drive a crash car.

350
00:49:22,353 --> 00:49:25,200
You could get your wish
at any moment.

351
00:49:25,233 --> 00:49:28,080
No. I mean a crash car
with a history.

352
00:49:28,113 --> 00:49:30,316
Camus' Fassellvega...

353
00:49:30,353 --> 00:49:33,353
Nathaniel West's
station wagon...

354
00:49:33,392 --> 00:49:36,556
Grace Kelly's Rover 3500.

355
00:49:36,592 --> 00:49:39,527
Just fix it enough
to get it rolling.

356
00:49:39,568 --> 00:49:42,917
Don't clean it.
Don't touch anything else.

357
00:49:48,207 --> 00:49:51,077
Is that why you drive this car?

358
00:49:53,007 --> 00:49:54,894
Do you see Kennedy's
assassination...

359
00:49:54,927 --> 00:49:57,774
as a special kind of car crash?

360
00:49:57,807 --> 00:49:59,781
A case could be made.

361
00:50:00,751 --> 00:50:02,693
Whoa! Watch this!
You're gonna hit him.

362
00:50:04,047 --> 00:50:06,600
Oh, God.

363
00:50:10,767 --> 00:50:13,865
Here. Take a look at this.

364
00:50:13,903 --> 00:50:15,812
Tell me what you think of these.

365
00:50:21,102 --> 00:50:24,964
You recognize this one.
This is James Dean.

366
00:50:29,006 --> 00:50:32,006
This is the next one
Seagrave and I are gonna do...

367
00:50:32,045 --> 00:50:33,223
Jayne Mansfield.

368
00:50:38,381 --> 00:50:40,748
It's all very satisfying.

369
00:50:40,781 --> 00:50:43,629
I'm not sure I understand why.

370
00:50:45,325 --> 00:50:48,008
That's the future, Ballard...

371
00:50:48,653 --> 00:50:50,508
and you're already a part of it.

372
00:50:51,533 --> 00:50:54,881
You're beginning to see
that for the first time...

373
00:50:54,925 --> 00:50:58,405
there's a benevolent
psychopathology...

374
00:50:58,444 --> 00:50:59,971
that beckons towards us.

375
00:51:01,164 --> 00:51:04,993
For example, the car crash
is a fertilizing...

376
00:51:05,036 --> 00:51:07,011
rather than a destructive event.

377
00:51:08,364 --> 00:51:12,226
A liberation of sexual energy...

378
00:51:12,267 --> 00:51:14,569
mediating the sexuality
of those who have died...

379
00:51:14,603 --> 00:51:18,400
with an intensity that's
impossible in any other form.

380
00:51:18,443 --> 00:51:21,759
Now, to experience that...

381
00:51:21,803 --> 00:51:24,356
to live that, that is...

382
00:51:25,963 --> 00:51:27,937
That's my project.

383
00:51:27,978 --> 00:51:32,321
What about reshaping the human
body by modern technology?

384
00:51:32,363 --> 00:51:34,948
I thought that was your project.

385
00:51:34,987 --> 00:51:38,020
That's just
a crude sci-fi concept.

386
00:51:38,058 --> 00:51:40,295
It just kind of
floats on the surface...

387
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:41,639
and doesn't threaten anybody.

388
00:51:43,498 --> 00:51:44,774
I use it to test
the resilience...

389
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,265
of my potential partners
in psychopathology.

390
00:52:11,209 --> 00:52:13,892
- What's going on, baby?
- What's going on with you?

391
00:52:13,929 --> 00:52:15,968
- Want to go for a ride?
- You and your friend?

392
00:52:16,969 --> 00:52:19,107
- Just me and my friend here.
- That's cool.

393
00:52:19,145 --> 00:52:21,250
- Don't go away.
- What you got under there?

394
00:52:21,288 --> 00:52:23,655
- I'm clean.
- You got a place?

395
00:52:23,688 --> 00:52:26,950
- The back seat of my car.
- In your car?

396
00:52:26,984 --> 00:52:31,294
- He'll drive.
- We'll go driving around?

397
00:52:31,335 --> 00:52:33,223
- Absolutely. $60.
- $60?

398
00:52:33,255 --> 00:52:35,622
You'll get a nice scenic ride.

399
00:52:35,656 --> 00:52:36,997
One fifty for the two.

400
00:52:37,032 --> 00:52:38,919
- No. It's just me.
- Just you?

401
00:52:38,952 --> 00:52:41,439
If he does get involved,
I'll give you 150.

402
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,235
- Maybe.
- What do you mean?

403
00:52:43,271 --> 00:52:45,889
I'm saying, is he all right?

404
00:52:48,614 --> 00:52:50,502
Come here, sweetie.

405
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:51,941
You open your mouth.

406
00:52:51,975 --> 00:52:54,975
- Yes, Daddy.
- There you go.

407
00:52:55,015 --> 00:52:57,884
I don't want you blowing
it up my urethra.

408
00:53:00,134 --> 00:53:01,857
James, you drive.

409
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,688
James, we're leaving now.

410
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,182
Do you want a lift?

411
00:55:05,377 --> 00:55:06,686
No, thank you.

412
00:55:07,936 --> 00:55:10,871
Catherine's
coming to pick me up.

413
00:55:21,407 --> 00:55:22,585
What's going on?

414
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:27,381
They're questioning him about
an accident at the airport.

415
00:55:27,423 --> 00:55:29,463
A pedestrian was killed.

416
00:55:31,135 --> 00:55:34,070
They think he was
run over intentionally.

417
00:55:34,111 --> 00:55:36,500
Vaughan isn't interested
in pedestrians.

418
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:41,782
Don't you think
he looks a bit shaky?

419
00:55:45,631 --> 00:55:48,860
- Maybe I should drive him.
- Where's your car?

420
00:55:48,894 --> 00:55:51,065
At home.
Couldn't face the traffic.

421
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:07,066
Why don't I drive?

422
00:56:41,852 --> 00:56:43,510
You coming?

423
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:52,569
- Third westbound at Jameson.
-793, Control. I'm 10-17.

424
00:56:52,603 --> 00:56:54,458
Please advise the ambulance
that three lanes are...

425
00:57:06,171 --> 00:57:07,600
Let's record this.

426
00:57:17,562 --> 00:57:20,049
This is a work of art.

427
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:22,228
Absolutely a work of art.

428
00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:32,217
Slow down.

429
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:33,297
Slow down. Not so fast.

430
00:57:42,649 --> 00:57:44,656
Slow down. Stop.

431
01:01:05,487 --> 01:01:07,374
You couldn't wait for me?

432
01:01:07,407 --> 01:01:10,669
You did the Jayne Mansfield
crash without me?

433
01:01:10,703 --> 01:01:12,558
Oh, the dog.

434
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:14,794
The dog is brilliant.

435
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:31,565
I must have driven
through something.

436
01:01:33,166 --> 01:01:36,581
There's some blood on the car
here on the handle...

437
01:01:36,622 --> 01:01:42,121
and on the wheel,
and also the wheel well.

438
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:43,750
See?

439
01:01:45,197 --> 01:01:48,044
If the police stop you again,
they may impound the car.

440
01:01:48,077 --> 01:01:50,946
You're right, Ballard.

441
01:01:52,397 --> 01:01:56,674
There's an all-night car wash
by the airport service area.

442
01:01:58,253 --> 01:01:59,201
Watch yourself.

443
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:55,473
Is there something here
that interests you?

444
01:09:59,573 --> 01:10:01,002
This interests me.

445
01:10:03,093 --> 01:10:05,514
I'd like to see
if I can fit into a car...

446
01:10:05,558 --> 01:10:07,979
designed for a normal body.

447
01:10:08,021 --> 01:10:10,225
Could you help me
into it, please?

448
01:10:12,885 --> 01:10:13,998
Yeah, sure.

449
01:10:21,205 --> 01:10:23,027
Are these safe cars?

450
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:25,548
Yes, of course.
They're very safe.

451
01:10:51,827 --> 01:10:53,104
I'm caught.

452
01:11:26,290 --> 01:11:28,395
Oh, shit.

453
01:11:30,929 --> 01:11:34,224
Fuck. This is bad.
This is really bad.

454
01:14:00,330 --> 01:14:02,534
James, somebody named Vaughan.
You want it?

455
01:14:07,306 --> 01:14:08,648
Hello. Ballard.

456
01:14:08,682 --> 01:14:10,504
I need to see you, Ballard.

457
01:14:10,538 --> 01:14:13,320
I need to talk to you
about the project.

458
01:14:16,553 --> 01:14:18,309
Where are you?

459
01:14:32,457 --> 01:14:34,279
I think you're making it
too clean.

460
01:14:34,312 --> 01:14:36,800
Medical tattoos
are supposed to be clean.

461
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,214
But this is not
a medical tattoo.

462
01:14:38,248 --> 01:14:40,255
This is a prophetic tattoo.

463
01:14:40,296 --> 01:14:43,330
And prophecy's ragged
and dirty...

464
01:14:45,544 --> 01:14:48,893
so make it ragged and dirty.

465
01:14:48,936 --> 01:14:50,627
Prophetic?

466
01:14:50,664 --> 01:14:53,730
Is this personal prophecy
or global prophecy?

467
01:14:55,048 --> 01:14:56,574
There's no difference.

468
01:14:58,952 --> 01:15:00,839
Let me see here. Where is it?

469
01:15:02,439 --> 01:15:08,669
James, I want you to let her
give you this one.

470
01:15:17,062 --> 01:15:18,917
Where do you think
that one should go?

471
01:20:29,943 --> 01:20:31,765
I thought that was you up there.

472
01:20:36,152 --> 01:20:38,061
My last lesson's next week.

473
01:20:54,262 --> 01:20:56,629
James, my car is...

474
01:21:02,870 --> 01:21:04,015
What?

475
01:21:06,773 --> 01:21:08,366
Could it have been deliberate?

476
01:21:10,902 --> 01:21:12,309
One of your suitors?

477
01:21:31,092 --> 01:21:32,554
It was Vaughan.

478
01:21:48,915 --> 01:21:50,639
The traffic.

479
01:21:51,732 --> 01:21:52,976
Where is everyone?

480
01:21:54,547 --> 01:21:55,889
They've all gone away.

481
01:22:01,235 --> 01:22:02,893
I'd like to go back, James.

482
01:24:45,228 --> 01:24:47,649
He came from up there, overhead!

483
01:26:37,926 --> 01:26:42,017
I'd like to register a claim
for the 1963 black Lincoln.

484
01:26:42,053 --> 01:26:44,093
Is there a form
I should fill out?

485
01:26:45,253 --> 01:26:47,620
I can give you the forms now...

486
01:26:47,654 --> 01:26:50,043
but you'll have to come back
between 7:30 and 4:30...

487
01:26:50,085 --> 01:26:51,841
to register a claim.

488
01:26:52,806 --> 01:26:54,496
What's your attachment
to that thing?

489
01:26:56,613 --> 01:26:58,555
A close friend owned it.

490
01:26:58,597 --> 01:27:00,091
It's a total write-off.

491
01:27:00,133 --> 01:27:02,653
I don't see what you
can possibly do with it.

492
01:30:26,555 --> 01:30:28,213
Are you all right?

493
01:30:39,195 --> 01:30:40,755
I don't know.

494
01:30:42,874 --> 01:30:44,598
Are you hurt?

495
01:30:48,122 --> 01:30:50,031
I think I'm all right.

496
01:30:58,713 --> 01:31:00,501
I think I'm all right.

497
01:31:19,992 --> 01:31:21,585
Maybe the next one, darling.

498
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:34,258
Maybe the next one.
