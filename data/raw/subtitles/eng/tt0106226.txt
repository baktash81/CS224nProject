1
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,714
Well...

2
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:39,611
I didn't think the Mingotts
would have tried it on.

3
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,072
Parading her at the opera like that,

4
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,116
sitting her next to May Welland.

5
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,784
It's all very odd.

6
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,412
Well, she's had such an odd life.

7
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,039
Will they even bring her
to the Beauforts' ball, do you suppose?

8
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,042
If they do, the talk will be of little else.

9
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,317
Good evening, Mrs Welland.
Good evening, May.

10
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:22,237
Newland.
You know my niece Countess Olenska.

11
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,292
Countess.

12
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,888
I hope you've told Madame Olenska.

13
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,139
What?

14
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,557
That we're engaged.

15
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:54,144
I want everybody to know.

16
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:57,105
Let me announce it this evening at the ball.

17
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,941
If you can persuade Mamma.

18
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,444
Why should we change
what is already settled?

19
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,155
But you can tell my cousin yourself.

20
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,907
She remembers you.

21
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,619
I remember we played together.

22
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,121
How this brings it all back to me.

23
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,500
I remember everybody here the same way,

24
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,835
in knickerbockers and pantalettes.

25
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:36,603
You were horrid.
You kissed me once behind a door.

26
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:40,315
But it was your cousin Vandie, the one
who never looked at me, I was in love with.

27
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,739
Yes, you have been away a very long time.

28
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,074
Centuries and centuries.

29
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:52,994
So long, I'm sure I'm dead and buried,
and this dear old place is heaven.

30
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,626
It invariably happened,

31
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:45,922
as everything happened
in those days, in the same way.

32
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:49,342
As usuaI, Mrs Julius Beaufort appeared,

33
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,428
unaccompanied by her husband,

34
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:54,055
just before The Jewel Song.

35
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:59,978
And again, as usuaI, rose at the end
of the third act and disappeared.

36
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:03,565
New York then knew that a half hour later,

37
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:07,319
the Beauforts' Annual Opera Ball
would begin.

38
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,838
Carriages waited at the kerb
for the entire performance.

39
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:30,425
It was widely known in New York,
but never acknowledged,

40
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,011
that Americans want
to get away from amusement,

41
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:36,181
even more quickly than they want to get to it.

42
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,946
The Beauforts' house
was one of the few in New York

43
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,365
that possessed a ballroom.

44
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:58,703
Such a room,
shuttered in darkness 364 days of the year,

45
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,163
was felt to compensate

46
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:04,167
for whatever was regrettable
in the Beaufort past.

47
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,879
Regina Beaufort came
from an old South Carolina family,

48
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:11,800
but her husband Julius,
who passed for an Englishman,

49
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,219
was known to have dissipated habits,

50
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:17,472
a bitter tongue and mysterious antecedents.

51
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:21,226
His marriage assured him a sociaI position,

52
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,436
but not necessarily respect.

53
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,727
Newland Archer had not stopped at his club,

54
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,770
as young men usually did,

55
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,231
but came directly to the Beauforts.

56
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,650
He wanted the announcement
of his engagement

57
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,445
to divert gossip away from the Countess,

58
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:18,033
and show his most ardent support
for May and her whole family.

59
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:28,585
The Beaufort house
had been boldly planned.

60
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,254
Instead of squeezing
through a narrow passage

61
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,424
to get to the ballroom,
one marched solemnly

62
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,469
down a vista of enfiladed drawing rooms.

63
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,012
Good evening.

64
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:56,738
But only by actually passing
through the Crimson Drawing Room

65
00:10:56,822 --> 00:11:00,158
could one see The Return of Spring,

66
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,744
the much-discussed nude by Bouguereau,

67
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:07,916
which Beaufort had had the audacity
to hang in plain sight.

68
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,504
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mr Archer.

69
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,635
Archer enjoyed such challenges
to convention.

70
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,346
He questioned conformity in private,

71
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,849
but in public he upheld family and tradition.

72
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:28,269
This was a world balanced so precariously

73
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,523
that its harmony could be shattered
by a whisper.

74
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,213
On the whole, Archer was amused

75
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,133
by the smooth hypocrisies of his peers.

76
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,677
He may even have envied them.

77
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:06,391
Lawrence Lefferts, for instance,
was New York's foremost authority on form.

78
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,936
And his opinion on pumps
versus patent-leather oxfords

79
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,021
had never been disputed.

80
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,858
On matters of surreptitious romance,

81
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,736
his skills went unquestioned.

82
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:41,134
Old Mr Sillerton Jackson
was as great an authority on family

83
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,928
as Lawrence Lefferts was on form.

84
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:48,933
The mean and melancholy history
of Countess Olenska's European marriage

85
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,729
was a buried treasure
he hastened to excavate.

86
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,773
He carried, like a calling card,

87
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,443
an entire register
of the scandals and mysteries

88
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,279
that had smouldered
under the unruffled surface

89
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:05,200
of society for the last 50 years.

90
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:17,170
Julius Beaufort's secret was
the way he carried things off.

91
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,672
He could arrive casually at his own party,

92
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,341
as if he were another guest,

93
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:24,344
and might also leave early for a more modest,

94
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:27,889
but comforting address in the East 30s.

95
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,391
Beaufort was intrepid in his business,

96
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:34,187
but in his personaI affairs
absolutely audacious.

97
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:43,321
Archer's fiancÃ©e was innocent
to all of these intrigues and of much else.

98
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:48,493
May Welland represented
for Archer all that was best in their world,

99
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:52,163
all that he honoured,
and she anchored him to it.

100
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,171
You see,
I've told all my friends, just as you've asked.

101
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,675
Yes, I couldn't wait.
Only I wish it hadn't had to be at a ball.

102
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,176
But even here, we're alone together.

103
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:10,098
The worst of it is that
I want to kiss you, and I can't.

104
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,809
Newland.

105
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,029
Did you tell Ellen as I asked you to?

106
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,700
No, I didn't have the chance after all.

107
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:32,370
She's my cousin, Newland.
If others know before she does...

108
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:35,331
It's just that she's been away for so long.
She's rather sensitive.

109
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,334
Of course I'll tell her, dearest,
but I didn't see her yet.

110
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:41,504
She decided not to come at the last minute.

111
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,089
At the last minute?

112
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,050
She was afraid her dress
wasn't smart enough.

113
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,594
We all thought it was so lovely,

114
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,013
but she asked my aunt to take her home.

115
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,599
Oh, well.

116
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,494
Very handsome. Very liberal.

117
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,581
In my time, a cameo set in pearls

118
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,499
was thought to be sufficient.

119
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:22,503
But it's the hand that sets off the ring,
isn't it, my dear, Mr Archer?

120
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,298
It's the new setting.
It shows the stone beautifully.

121
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,259
But it looks a little bare
to old-fashioned eyes.

122
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,595
I hope you don't mean mine, my dear.

123
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,931
I like all the novelties.

124
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,309
My hands were modelled
in Paris by the great Roche.

125
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,852
He should do May's.

126
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,104
Show me, child.

127
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,857
Her hand is so tempered.

128
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:47,904
It's these modern sports
that spread the joints. But the skin is white.

129
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,238
And when's the wedding to be?

130
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,159
As soon as ever it can,
if only you'll back me up, Mrs Mingott.

131
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,081
We must give them time to get
to know each other a little better, Mamma.

132
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,207
Know each other?

133
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,126
Everybody in New York
has always known everybody.

134
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,462
Don't wait till the bubble's off the wine.

135
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,214
Marry them before Lent.

136
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:10,218
I may catch pneumonia any winter now,
and I want to give the wedding breakfast.

137
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,886
What a kind offer.

138
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,555
Even if she had not been grandmother
to May,

139
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,558
Mrs Manson Mingott
would still have been the first

140
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,020
to receive the required betrothaI visit.

141
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,815
She was not only the matriarch of this world,

142
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,567
she was nearly its dowager empress.

143
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,945
Much of New York was already related to her,

144
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:33,157
and she knew the remainder by marriage
or by reputation.

145
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,326
Though brownstone was the norm,

146
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,830
she lived magisterially within a large house

147
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:43,042
of controversiaI pale cream-coloured stone

148
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:47,588
in an inaccessible wilderness
near the Central Park.

149
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,925
The burden of her flesh
had long since made it impossible

150
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,428
for her to go up and down stairs.

151
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,930
So with characteristic independence,

152
00:16:56,015 --> 00:17:00,476
she had established herself
on the ground floor of her house.

153
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:05,606
From her sitting room, there was
an unexpected vista of her bedroom.

154
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,192
Her visitors were startled and fascinated,

155
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,319
by the foreignness of this arrangement,

156
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:14,490
which recalled scenes in French fiction.

157
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:19,162
This was how women
with lovers lived in the wicked old societies.

158
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,748
But if Mrs Mingott had wanted a lover,

159
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:25,626
the intrepid woman would have had him, too.

160
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,505
For now she was content
simply for life and passion

161
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,300
to flow northward to her door

162
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:36,262
and to anticipate eagerly the union
of Newland Archer

163
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,389
with her granddaughter, May.

164
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,392
In them, two of New York's best families

165
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,187
would finally and momentously be joined.

166
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,898
- Bye, Mamma.
- Good-bye.

167
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:47,982
Ellen!

168
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,234
- Ladies. Archer.
- Aunt Tessa, May.

169
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,322
Beaufort, this is a rare favour.

170
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,616
Unnecessarily rare, I'd say.

171
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,952
I met Countess Ellen in Madison Square,

172
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,662
and she was good enough
to let me walk home with her.

173
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,165
This house will be merrier
now that she's here.

174
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,167
- Thank you.
- Beaufort, pull up that tuffet.

175
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,251
This one?

176
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,753
I want a good gossip.

177
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,297
Of course, you already know
about May and me.

178
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:14,092
She scolded me
for not telling you at the opera.

179
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,594
Of course I know, and I'm so glad.

180
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,889
One doesn't tell such news first in a crowd.

181
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:24,018
Careful there.
Don't let your ring catch on your sleeve.

182
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,729
- Good-bye, Ellen.
- Good-bye. Good-bye.

183
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,023
Good-bye.

184
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,860
Come and see me someday.

185
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,157
It's a mistake for Ellen
to be seen parading up

186
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,284
Fifth Avenue with Julius Beaufort,

187
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:44,247
at the crowded hour,
the very day after her arrival.

188
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,166
His behaviour is always so flagrant.

189
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,085
Even his wife must know about Annie Ring.

190
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,349
Sillerton Jackson enjoyed his frequent visits

191
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:07,228
to the Archer home
more than the actuaI dining.

192
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:11,274
Newland Archer's mother
and his sister Janey were both shy women

193
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:16,154
and shrank from society, but they like
to be well-informed of its doings

194
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,114
and doted on their bachelor friend.

195
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,700
Certain nuances escape Beaufort.

196
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:24,036
Necessarily. Beaufort is a vulgar man.

197
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,372
Nevertheless, no business nuances
escape him.

198
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,666
Most of New York trusts him with its affairs.

199
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,502
My grandfather Newland
always used to say to Mother,

200
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:35,715
"Don't let that fellow Beaufort
be introduced to the girls. "

201
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,720
At least he's had the advantage
of association with gentlemen.

202
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,973
The Archers and the Mingotts
were two of the sturdiest branches

203
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,934
of New York's tangled family tree.

204
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,855
Granny Mingott's family
could embrace May's traditionalism

205
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:54,108
and tolerate Ellen's unconventionality.

206
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,862
But Archer's family held fast to the old ways.

207
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:01,908
His mother and sister relied on him
for every security.

208
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:05,369
He would always be,
Mrs Archer assured May's mother,

209
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,496
their "strong right hand. "

210
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,499
And our new cousin,
was she at the ball, too?

211
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:14,837
I appreciate the Mingotts wanting
to support her, to have her at the opera.

212
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,548
I admire their esprit de corps.

213
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,218
But why my son's engagement

214
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,346
should be mixed up
with this woman's comings and goings,

215
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,555
I don't see.

216
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,058
Well, in any case, she was not at the ball.

217
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,644
At least she had that decency.

218
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,271
Sir?

219
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,648
Oh, no.

220
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:37,109
I wonder if she wears a round hat
or a bonnet in the afternoon.

221
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,737
The dress she wore to the opera
was so plain and flat.

222
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,989
I'm sure it was in better taste
not to go to the ball.

223
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,532
It wasn't a question of taste, Mother.

224
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:46,244
May said the Countess decided
her dress wasn't smart enough.

225
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,329
Poor Ellen.

226
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,999
We must always remember
the eccentric bringing-up she had.

227
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,584
What can you expect of a girl

228
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,504
who was allowed to wear black satin
at her coming out ball?

229
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,507
It's odd she should've kept
such an ugly name as Ellen

230
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,425
when she married the Count.

231
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,344
I should have changed it to Elaine.

232
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,513
Why?

233
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:10,726
I don't know. It sounds more Polish.

234
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,147
It certainly sounds more conspicuous,

235
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,024
and that can hardly be what she wishes.

236
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,236
Why not? Why shouldn't she
be conspicuous if she chooses?

237
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,781
She made an awful marriage. But should she
hide her head as if it's her fault?

238
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,701
Should she go slinking around
as if she disgraced herself?

239
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:31,038
She's had an unhappy life.
That doesn't make her an outcast.

240
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,709
I'm sure that's the line
the Mingotts mean to take.

241
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:39,797
I don't have to wait
for their cue if that's what you mean, sir.

242
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,217
I'm told she's looking for a house.

243
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,927
She intends to live here.

244
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,346
I hear she means to get a divorce.

245
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,975
I hope she will.

246
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,480
Understandably her marriage was intolerable.

247
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,984
But there are the rumours, too.

248
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,403
I've heard them. The secretary.

249
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,034
He helped get her away from the husband.

250
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,331
They say the Count kept her
practically a prisoner.

251
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,751
Certainly the Count had his own way of life.

252
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,338
You knew him?

253
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,298
I heard of him at Nice.

254
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,134
Handsome, they say, but...

255
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,679
Eyes with a lot of lashes.

256
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:34,060
When he wasn't with women,
he was collecting china.

257
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,897
Paying any price for both, I understand.

258
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,107
Then where's the blame?

259
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,943
Anyone of us under the same circumstances
would have helped the Countess,

260
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,820
just as the secretary did.

261
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:48,032
He was still helping her a year later then,

262
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:51,035
because somebody met them living together
at Lausanne.

263
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,622
Living together?

264
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:59,001
Well, why not? Who has the right
to make her life over if she hasn't?

265
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:02,713
Why should we bury a woman alive
if her husband prefers to live with whores?

266
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:07,259
It's hardly a question of entombment.
The Countess is here after all.

267
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,763
Or do you believe

268
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:13,849
a woman should share
the same freedoms as men?

269
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,395
I suppose I do. Yes, I do.

270
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:21,315
Well, apparently Count Olenski
takes a similarly modern view.

271
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:25,736
I never heard of him lifting a finger
to get his wife back.

272
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:32,076
Three days later, the unthinkable happened.

273
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,371
Mrs Manson Mingott sent out invitations

274
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:38,165
summoning everyone to a formaI dinner.

275
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:42,461
Such an occasion demanded
the most careful consideration.

276
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,922
It required the appropriated plate.

277
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,299
It called for three extra footmen,

278
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,176
two dishes for each course

279
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,137
and a Roman punch in the middle.

280
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,559
The dinner, New York read on the invitation,

281
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,270
was "to meet the Countess Olenska. "

282
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,484
And New York declined.

283
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,656
"Regret unable to accept. "

284
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,616
And from some of our own family.

285
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:17,955
No one cares enough even
to conceal their feelings about the Countess.

286
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,123
This is a disgrace.

287
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:22,585
They all lived in a kind of
hieroglyphic world.

288
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:26,297
The reaI thing was never said
or done or even thought,

289
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:30,426
but only represented
by a set of arbitrary signs.

290
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,804
Archer knew these signs.

291
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,849
They were not subtle
and were not meant to be.

292
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:39,435
They were more than a simple snubbing.

293
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,146
They were an eradication.

294
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,774
There was a single court of appeaI.

295
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:49,487
He would plead their case
before the van der Luydens.

296
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:55,075
And all this, you think,
is due to some intentional interference by...

297
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,244
Larry Lefferts. Yes, sir, I'm certain of it.

298
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,831
The van der Luydens dwelled
above the city's families

299
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:04,668
in a kind of super-terrestriaI twilight.

300
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:09,507
Archer appealed to their exquisitely refined
sense of tribal order.

301
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,300
And he spoke plainly.

302
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,843
Whenever poor Gertrude Lefferts begins

303
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:16,222
to suspect her husband of something,

304
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:20,392
Larry starts making some great diversionary
fuss to show how moral he is.

305
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:23,938
Well, it's the principle that I dislike.

306
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,816
I mean to say,
if a member of a well-known family

307
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,319
is backed by that family,

308
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,321
it should be considered final.

309
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:37,284
We all felt this slight on the Countess should
not pass without our consulting you.

310
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:42,164
So, we are giving a little dinner
for our cousin, the Duke of St Austrey,

311
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,833
who arrives next week on the Russia.

312
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,087
I'm sure Louisa will be as glad as I am,

313
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:52,800
if Countess Olenska
will let us include her among our guests.

314
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,974
The occasion was a solemn one,

315
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,935
but the Countess Olenska arrived rather late,

316
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:07,648
signalling a carelessness
of which she was entirely unaware.

317
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,776
She entered without haste or embarrassment.

318
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,822
The drawing room
in which New York's most chosen company

319
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,825
was somewhat awfully assembled.

320
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,035
Countess Olenska.

321
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,622
Good evening.

322
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,125
- We're delighted you're here.
- Good evening.

323
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,711
The Duke of St Austrey,
may I present Countess Olenska.

324
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,673
The Trevenna George ll plate was out.

325
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:36,427
So was the van der Luyden Lowestoft
from the East India Company.

326
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:39,430
And the Dagonet Crown Derby.

327
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:43,350
Dining with the van der Luydens
was at best no light matter.

328
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,562
Dining there with a duke
who was their cousin

329
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:50,024
was almost a religious solemnity.

330
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:54,320
When the van der Luydens chose,
they knew how to give a lesson.

331
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,611
Excuse me.

332
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:42,326
It was not the custom
in New York drawing rooms

333
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,579
for a lady to get up
and walk away from one gentleman

334
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,999
in order to seek the company of another,

335
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,960
but the Countess did not observe this rule.

336
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,718
I want you to talk to me about May.

337
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,430
You knew the Duke before?

338
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,600
From Nice. We used to see him every winter.

339
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:11,355
He's very fond of gambling, and he used
to come to our house a great deal.

340
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,732
He likes to wear the same suit every evening.

341
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:16,568
He thinks it brings him luck.

342
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:19,029
I think he's the dullest man I ever met.

343
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:23,033
But he seems to be admired here.

344
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,538
May I tell you
what most interests me about New York?

345
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:32,751
Not all the blind obeying of tradition,
somebody else's tradition.

346
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:36,714
It seems stupid to have discovered America
only to make it a copy of another country.

347
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,258
Do you suppose Christopher Columbus
would have taken all that trouble

348
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,427
just to go to the opera with Larry Lefferts?

349
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,934
Well, I think
if he'd suspected that Lefferts were here,

350
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:51,937
the Santa Maria might never have left port.

351
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,483
And May, does she share these views?

352
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,819
If she does, she'd never say so.

353
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,072
Are you very much in love with her?

354
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,408
As much as a man can be.

355
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,368
Do you think there's a limit?

356
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,957
If there is, I haven't found it.

357
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,671
It's really and truly a romance then,

358
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,424
not in the least arranged.

359
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:25,095
Have you forgotten? In our country
we don't allow our marriages to be arranged.

360
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,266
Yes, I forgot. I'm sorry.

361
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,685
I sometimes make these mistakes.

362
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:35,981
I don't always remember
that everything here is good.

363
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:39,193
That was bad where I came from.

364
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:44,823
I'm so sorry.

365
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,116
No.

366
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:52,956
But you know you are among friends here.

367
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,043
Yes, I know. That's why I came home.

368
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,090
Good evening, Louisa.

369
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,634
May I present May Welland.

370
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,344
You'll want to be with May.

371
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,513
I'm so pleased to meet you.

372
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:10,265
She's already surrounded.
I have so many rivals.

373
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,600
Yes.

374
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,895
Then stay with me a little longer.

375
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,190
Yes.

376
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:21,735
Mr Urban Dagonet,
may I present the Countess Olenska.

377
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,362
How do you do, my dear?

378
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,655
How do you do?

379
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:27,658
Tomorrow then, after 5:00 I'll expect you.

380
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,452
Tomorrow.

381
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,329
Excuse me.

382
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:44,132
It was good of you
to devote yourself to Madame Olenska

383
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,969
so unselfishly, dear Newland.

384
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,763
I told Henry he really must rescue you.

385
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,934
I think I've never seen May looking lovelier.

386
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:58,564
The Duke thinks her the handsomest woman
in the room.

387
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:04,296
It was my pleasure.

388
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,342
Mr Archer.

389
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:13,096
So how do you like this odd little house?

390
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,806
To me, it's like heaven.

391
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:18,060
- You've arranged it delightfully.
- Yes.

392
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,771
Some of the things
I managed to bring with me.

393
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:23,815
Little pieces of wreckage.

394
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,945
At least it's less gloomy
than the van der Luydens',

395
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,781
and not so difficult to be alone.

396
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:34,117
I am sure it's often thought
the van der Luydens' is gloomy,

397
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,536
though I've never heard it said before.

398
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,997
But tell me, do you really like to be alone?

399
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,709
As long as my friends
keep me from being lonely.

400
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:48,507
I see you've already chosen your corner.

401
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,633
Yes.

402
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,009
- Please, sit.
- Thank you.

403
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,724
This is the hour I like best.

404
00:32:58,601 --> 00:32:59,977
Don't you?

405
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,187
I was afraid you'd forgotten the hour.

406
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:05,107
I am sure Beaufort can be very intriguing.

407
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:11,738
He took me to see some houses.
I'm told I must move.

408
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,075
Even though this street
seems perfectly respectable.

409
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:18,286
- Yes, but it's not fashionable.
- Fashionable?

410
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,956
Is fashion such a serious consideration?

411
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,584
Among people
who have nothing more serious to consider.

412
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,715
Perhaps I've been too independent.

413
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:35,429
All I really want is to feel cared for and safe.

414
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,686
Thank you.
The van der Luydens do nothing by halves.

415
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,814
All New York laid itself out for you last night.

416
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:49,192
It was so kind. Such a nice party.

417
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,777
Cream or lemon?

418
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,364
Lemon, please.

419
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:58,660
The van der Luydens are the most powerful
influence in New York society.

420
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:02,330
They very seldom receive
because of Cousin Louisa's health.

421
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,791
Perhaps that's the reason then.

422
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,168
Thank you. "The reason"?

423
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:09,463
For their influence.
They make themselves so rare.

424
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:13,091
But, of course, you must tell me.

425
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,761
No, it's you telling me.

426
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:22,184
- Thank you.
- Then we can both help each other.

427
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,686
But I need help so much more.

428
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:30,400
There are so many people all ready
to tell you what to do.

429
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:37,407
I think they're all a little angry with me
for setting up for myself.

430
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:41,286
Still your family can advise you,
show you the way.

431
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,164
Is New York such a labyrinth?

432
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:48,627
I thought it was all straight up and down,
like Fifth Avenue.

433
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:53,423
All the cross streets numbered,
and big, honest labels on everything.

434
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,968
Everything is labelled, but everybody is not.

435
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,849
Then I must count on you for warnings, too.

436
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,811
All the older women like and admire you.
They want to help.

437
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:09,815
I know. I know, as long
as they don't hear anything unpleasant.

438
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:15,779
Does no one here want
to know the truth, Mr Archer?

439
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:18,782
The real loneliness
is living among all these kind people

440
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:21,326
who only ask you to pretend.

441
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,874
No, no, you mustn't.

442
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,336
Madame Olenska.

443
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,007
Ellen.

444
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,971
Does no one cry here either?

445
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,682
I suppose there's no need to.

446
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,367
Mr Archer, good evening.

447
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,536
We didn't see you this morning

448
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,997
and we weren't sure whether
to send Miss Welland the usual...

449
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:10,125
Lilies-of-the-valley. Yes,
I think we better make that a standing order.

450
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,751
Very good, sir.

451
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:20,343
And those yellow roses.
I'll give you another address.

452
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,428
Very good.

453
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,099
George!

454
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,478
Mr Archer, two separate orders.

455
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:36,860
They'll go at once?

456
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:37,986
At once, sir.

457
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,882
It's wonderful to wake every morning

458
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,550
with lilies-of-the-valley in my room.

459
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,885
It's like being with you.

460
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:05,472
They came late yesterday, I know.
Somehow the time got away from me.

461
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,724
But still you always remember.

462
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:10,852
I sent some roses to your Cousin Ellen, too.
Was that right?

463
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:15,106
Very right.
She didn't mention it at lunch today though.

464
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:18,151
She said she got some wonderful orchids
from Mr Beaufort,

465
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:21,821
and a whole hamper of carnations
from Cousin Henry van der Luyden.

466
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,241
She was so very delighted.

467
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:27,327
Don't people send flowers in Europe?

468
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,829
I know you do consider it a long time.

469
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:30,956
Very long.

470
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,208
But the Chiverses were engaged
for a year and a half.

471
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,752
Larry Lefferts and Gertrude
were engaged for two.

472
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:38,255
I'm sure Mamma expects
something customary.

473
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,548
Ever since you were little,
your parents let you have your way.

474
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,718
You're almost 22.
Just tell your mother what you want.

475
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:47,555
I couldn't refuse her the very last thing
she'd ask of me as a little girl.

476
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,308
Can't we just strike out for ourselves, May?

477
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,520
Shall we elope?

478
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:56,273
Well, if you would, why not?

479
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,443
You do love me, Newland. I'm so happy.

480
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,612
Well, why not be happier?

481
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,156
I couldn't be happier, dearest.

482
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,409
Did I tell you I showed Ellen the ring?

483
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:10,036
She thought it was
the most beautiful setting she ever saw.

484
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:13,707
She said there was nothing like it
in the Rue de la Paix.

485
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,502
I do love you, Newland.

486
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:19,921
Everything you do is so special.

487
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:25,427
I want to call on your legaI skills
for a rather delicate matter.

488
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:28,305
Countess Olenska
wants to sue her husband for divorce.

489
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:32,559
It's been suggested she means
to marry again, although she denies it.

490
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,812
Because of... I beg your pardon, sir,
but because of my engagement,

491
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:39,649
perhaps one of the other members of the firm
could consider this matter.

492
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,444
But precisely
because of your prospective alliance,

493
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:46,114
and considering that several members
of the family have already asked for you,

494
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,490
I'd like you to consider the case.

495
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:51,995
It's a family matter.
Perhaps it's best settled by the family.

496
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,663
Their position is clear.

497
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:57,917
They're entirely and rightly
against a divorce.

498
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:02,130
But Countess Olenska still insists
on a legal opinion.

499
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:05,050
But really, what's the use of a divorce?

500
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:07,927
She's here. He's there.

501
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:10,638
The whole Atlantic's between them.

502
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:14,517
As things go, Olenski's acted generously.

503
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:18,271
He's already returned
some of the money without being asked.

504
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,690
She'll never get a dollar more than that.

505
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:24,944
Although I understand
she attaches no importance to the money.

506
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:29,991
Considering all that, the wisest thing really,
is to do as the family say.

507
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,828
Just let well enough alone.

508
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,126
I think that's for her to decide.

509
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,884
Have you considered the consequences

510
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,053
if the Countess decides for divorce?

511
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,971
The consequences for the Countess?

512
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,390
For everyone.

513
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:58,144
I don't think the Count's accusations amount
to anything more than vague charges.

514
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,397
It will make for some talk.

515
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:03,441
Well, I have heard talk
about the Countess and the secretary.

516
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,527
I heard it even before I read the legal papers.

517
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,904
It's certain to be unpleasant.

518
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:09,989
Unpleasant?

519
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:13,993
Divorce is always unpleasant.
Don't you agree?

520
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,288
Naturally.

521
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,873
Then I can count on you?

522
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,000
The family can count on you.

523
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,461
You will use your influence
against a divorce?

524
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:27,799
I can't promise that,
not until I've talked to the Countess.

525
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,760
I don't understand you, Mr Archer.

526
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,637
You want to marry into a family

527
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:35,223
with a scandalous divorce suit
hanging over it?

528
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:40,186
I don't think that has anything to do
with the case.

529
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:43,857
Can someone take this for me
to the Countess, please?

530
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,864
Thank you.

531
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:55,368
You refuse such an invitation
on threat of death.

532
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,786
Is it so bad?

533
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,164
Not if you have a taste for slow agony.

534
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,082
That's something I've neglected to cultivate.

535
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,501
Three days at Skuytercliff
with the van der Luydens.

536
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,462
I think you better take your fur
and a hot water bottle.

537
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,880
Is the house that cold?

538
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,173
No, but Louisa is.

539
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,632
Mr Archer.

540
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:12,051
Join me at Delmonico's on Sunday instead.

541
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:15,138
I'm having a nice oyster supper
in your honour.

542
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:18,516
Private room, congenial company.
Artists and so on.

543
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,895
That's very tempting. I haven't met
a single artist since I've been here.

544
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:25,273
I know one or two painters
I could bring to see you if you'd allow me.

545
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:28,735
Painters?
Are there any painters in New York?

546
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:32,447
Thank you,
but I was really thinking of singers,

547
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:35,241
actors, musicians, dramatic artists.

548
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,412
There were always so many
at my husband's house.

549
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,623
May I write tomorrow and let you know?

550
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:43,875
It's too late to decide this evening.

551
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:46,377
- Is this late?
- Yes.

552
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,923
Because I still have
to talk business with Mr Archer.

553
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,347
Of course, Newland,
if you can persuade the Countess

554
00:41:57,431 --> 00:42:01,392
to change her mind about Sunday,
you can join us, too.

555
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,773
You know painters then?
You live in their milieu?

556
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,274
Not exactly.

557
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,026
But you care about such things?

558
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:13,905
Immensely. When I'm in Paris or London,
I never miss an exhibition.

559
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:15,698
I try to keep up.

560
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,367
I used to care immensely, too.

561
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,911
My life was full of such things,

562
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:25,375
but now I want to cast off all my old life
to become a complete American

563
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:27,460
and try to be like everybody else.

564
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,506
I don't think you'll ever quite be
like everybody else.

565
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,799
Don't say that to me, please.

566
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,009
I just want to put
all the old things behind me.

567
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,135
I know.

568
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,930
Mr Letterblair told me.

569
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,558
Mr Letterblair?

570
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:45,687
Yes, I've come because he asked me to.
I'm in the firm.

571
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:50,358
You mean it'll be you
who'll manage everything for me?

572
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:52,068
I can talk to you. That's so much easier.

573
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:54,195
Yes, I'm here to talk about it.

574
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,489
I've read all the legal papers.

575
00:42:57,783 --> 00:43:00,743
And the letter from the Count.

576
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,458
It was vile.

577
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:10,336
But if he chooses to fight the case,

578
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,964
he can say things that might be...

579
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,387
That might be disagreeable to you.

580
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:23,433
And say them publicly,
so that they could be damaging even if...

581
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:26,352
If?

582
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,274
Even if they were unfounded.

583
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:37,030
What harm could accusations
like that do me here?

584
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,867
Perhaps more harm than anywhere else.

585
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:44,787
Our legislation favours divorce,
but our social customs don't.

586
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,166
Never?

587
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,418
Well, not if the woman

588
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:55,173
has appearances
in the least degree against her,

589
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:59,719
has exposed herself
by any unconventional behaviour,

590
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:05,099
to offensive insinuations and...

591
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,770
Yes, so my family tell me.

592
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:15,276
Our family. You'll be my cousin soon.

593
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:20,740
And you agree with them?

594
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:34,087
What could you possibly gain
that would make up for the scandal?

595
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:37,965
My freedom.

596
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,053
But aren't you free already?

597
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,016
It's my business
to help you see these things just the way

598
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:51,604
the people who are fondest of you see them,
all your friends and relations.

599
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:54,816
If I didn't show you honestly
how they judge such matters,

600
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,609
it wouldn't be fair of me, would it?

601
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,823
No, it wouldn't be fair.

602
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,499
Very well. I'll...

603
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,502
Do as you wish.

604
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:18,756
I...

605
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,676
I do want to help you.

606
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:23,845
You do help me.

607
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,309
Good night, cousin.

608
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:48,453
For mercy's sake, don't cry so bitterly.

609
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:50,037
Forget what I've done.

610
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:51,622
On one condition.

611
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,876
I accept it, whatever it may be.

612
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:59,046
Never speak a word of love to me again!

613
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,298
Never!

614
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:07,472
On my honour.

615
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,286
Heaven bless you.

616
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,222
Farewell.

617
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,758
It's fascinating. Every season, the same play,

618
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:28,344
the same scene,
the same effect on the audience.

619
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:30,346
Remarkable, isn't it, Newland?

620
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,849
I'm enjoying it even more
than the London production.

621
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,852
You see this play even when you travel?

622
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:38,354
- I travel to get away from it.
- So was it a dinner?

623
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:40,731
It was a reception at Mrs Struthers'

624
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:43,860
given on the Lord's Day but with champagne

625
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:46,028
and singing from the table tops.

626
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,114
People say there was dancing.

627
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,116
It was a real French Sunday then?

628
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:54,453
Well, dissipation can be
wonderfully energising in the early stages...

629
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:03,296
Do you think her lover will send her
a box of yellow roses tomorrow morning?

630
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,055
I...

631
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,433
I was thinking about that, too.

632
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,146
The farewell scene.

633
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:23,900
Yes, I know.

634
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,694
It touches me as well.

635
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:31,490
I usually leave the theatre after that scene
to take the picture away with me.

636
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:40,124
I had a letter from May from St Augustine.

637
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,293
They always spend the winter there,

638
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:44,837
on account of her mother's bronchitis.

639
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,926
And what do you do while May is away?

640
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,515
I do my work.

641
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:11,697
I do want you to know
what you advised me was right.

642
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:18,204
Things can be so difficult sometimes,
and I'm so grateful.

643
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,972
The next day Newland Archer
searched the city in vain

644
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,890
for yellow roses.

645
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:40,685
From his office,
he sent a note to Madame Olenska

646
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,895
asking to call that afternoon,

647
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,315
and requesting reply by messenger.

648
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,777
There was no reply that day or the next.

649
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:55,324
And when yellow roses were again available,
Archer passed them by.

650
00:49:56,785 --> 00:50:00,454
It was only on the third day
that he heard from her by post,

651
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:03,040
from the van der Luydens' country home.

652
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:08,254
"Newland, I ran away the day
after I saw you at the play,

653
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,631
"and these kind friends have taken me in.

654
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:14,343
"I wanted to be quiet and think things over.

655
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:18,347
"I feel so safe here.
I wish that you were with us.

656
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,141
"Yours sincerely. "

657
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:26,480
He had received an invitation
from the Lefferts

658
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:30,943
for a weekend on the Hudson,
and he hoped it was not too late to reply.

659
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:34,321
Their house was not far
from the van der Luydens'.

660
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,171
I came to see
what you were running away from.

661
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,008
I knew you'd come.

662
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:55,551
That shows you wanted me to.

663
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:57,887
Cousin May wrote.
She asked you to take care of me.

664
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:00,222
- I didn't need to be asked.
- Why?

665
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:03,017
Does that mean
I'm so helpless and defenceless?

666
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:06,103
Or that women here are so blessed,
they never feel need?

667
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,605
What sort of need?

668
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:09,065
Please don't ask me.

669
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:11,317
I don't speak your language.

670
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:18,491
Henry left the old Patroon house open
for me. I want you to see it.

671
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:30,461
When you wrote me, you were unhappy.

672
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:34,548
Yes, but I can't feel unhappy
when you're here.

673
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,934
I shan't be here long.

674
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,268
I know.

675
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:49,855
Ellen, if you really wanted me to come,

676
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:54,777
if I'm really to help you,

677
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:01,325
you must tell me what you're running from.

678
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,835
Is he what you were running from?

679
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:56,463
Or what you expected?

680
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:57,631
I didn't know he was here.

681
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:04,263
Hello, Beaufort. This way.

682
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,682
Madame Olenska was expecting you.

683
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:07,808
Hello.

684
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:11,103
Well, you've certainly led me
on a bit of a chase.

685
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:16,984
All this way just to tell you
I'd found the perfect little house for you.

686
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:22,156
It's not on the market yet,
so you must take it at once.

687
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:26,118
Well, Archer, rusticating?

688
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:36,837
That night he did not take
the customary comfort

689
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:40,090
in his monthly shipment
of books from London.

690
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:44,386
The taste of the usual
was like cinders in his mouth.

691
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:45,930
And there were moments when he felt

692
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:49,225
as if he were being buried alive
under his future.

693
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:55,606
"Newland, come late tomorrow.
I must explain to you.

694
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:56,941
"Ellen. "

695
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:24,093
Newland. Has anything happened?

696
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:26,762
Yes. I found I had to see you.

697
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:34,645
- What is it?
- Nothing.

698
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:39,608
So tell me what you do all day?

699
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:44,238
Well, there are a few very pleasant people

700
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:48,367
from Philadelphia and Baltimore
who are picnicking at the inn,

701
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:51,453
and the Merrys
are setting up a lawn tennis court,

702
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:54,999
but nobody here's really heard
of the game yet.

703
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,417
I have my racket, of course,

704
00:54:56,501 --> 00:55:00,879
and so does Kate Merry,
but she's had this terrible case of bronchitis.

705
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,882
She's still not quite got over it yet, so...

706
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:10,431
But I thought...
I came here because I thought

707
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:14,018
I could persuade you
to break away from all that,

708
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:16,145
to advance our engagement.

709
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:21,442
Don't you understand
how much I want to marry you?

710
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:23,986
Why should we dream away another year?

711
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,280
I'm not sure I do understand, Newland.

712
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:33,120
Is it because you're not certain
of feeling the same way about me?

713
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:35,914
What on earth do you mean?

714
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:39,168
Is there someone else?

715
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,754
Someone else?

716
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,381
Between you and me?

717
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:49,011
Let's talk frankly, Newland.

718
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:52,139
I've felt a difference in you,
especially since our engagement.

719
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:53,223
Since our engagement?

720
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:55,392
If it's untrue,
then it won't hurt to talk about it.

721
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,811
And if it is true,
then why shouldn't we talk about it now?

722
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:59,980
I mean, you might have made a mistake.

723
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:02,399
If I'd made some sort of a mistake,
would I be down here,

724
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,318
asking you to hurry our marriage?

725
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:07,112
I don't know. You might.

726
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,615
It would be one way to settle the question.

727
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:16,246
In Newport, two years ago,

728
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:19,041
before we were promised,

729
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:21,543
everyone said
there was someone else for you.

730
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,379
I even saw you with her once,

731
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,672
sitting together on a veranda at a dance.

732
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:29,343
When she came into the house,
her face looked so sad.

733
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:33,180
I felt sorry for her,
and even after, when we were engaged,

734
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:35,265
I could still see how she looked and...

735
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:39,019
Is that...
Is that all you've been concerned about?

736
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,023
It's long passed.

737
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,237
Then is there something else?

738
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:51,240
No. Of course not.

739
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,412
Whatever it may have been,
Newland, I can't have my happiness

740
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:58,914
made out of a wrong to somebody else.

741
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:02,709
If promises were made, or if you feel
in some way pledged to this person,

742
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:04,837
even if it means her getting a divorce,

743
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:07,506
then, Newland,
don't give her up because of me.

744
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,007
There are no pledges.

745
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,844
There are no promises that matter.

746
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:14,555
That's all I've been trying to say.

747
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:18,267
There is no one between us.
There is nothing between us, May.

748
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:24,356
Which is precisely my argument
for getting married.

749
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:26,692
Quickly.

750
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:38,620
He could feeI her dropping back
to inexpressive girlishness.

751
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:41,790
Her conscience had been eased
of its burden.

752
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:45,752
It was wonderfuI, he thought,
how such depths of feeling

753
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:49,590
could coexist
with such an absence of imagination.

754
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:54,720
- And did you succeed?
- No.

755
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:58,140
No, I'd still like to be married in April,
with your help.

756
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:00,476
Now you're seeing the Mingott way.

757
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,144
Is this really so difficult?

758
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:04,646
The entire family is difficult.

759
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,565
Not one of them wants to be different.

760
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:09,610
When they are different,
they end up like Ellen's parents.

761
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:12,446
Nomads, continental wanderers.

762
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,573
Dragging Ellen about,

763
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:18,243
lavishing on her an expensive,
but incoherent education.

764
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,829
Out of all of them, I don't believe there's one

765
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:24,500
that takes after me but my little Ellen.

766
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:26,335
You've got a quick eye.

767
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:29,087
Why in the world didn't you marry her?

768
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:34,760
Well, for one thing,
she wasn't there to be married.

769
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:37,346
No, to be sure.

770
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:41,391
And she's still not. The Count, you know.

771
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,685
He's written to Mr Letterblair.

772
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:48,774
He wants her back, on her own terms.

773
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:53,529
The Count doesn't defend himself,
I will say that.

774
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:57,533
And Ellen will be losing a great deal
if she stayed here.

775
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,243
There's her old life,

776
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:03,956
gardens at Nice,
jewels, of course, music and conversation.

777
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:07,125
She says she goes unnoticed in Europe,

778
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,671
but I know her portrait's
been painted nine times.

779
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:15,717
All this, and the remorse of a guilty husband.

780
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:17,803
I'd rather see her dead.

781
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,389
Would you really?

782
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:25,727
We should remember marriage is marriage,
and Ellen is still a wife.

783
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:29,648
Ellen! See who's here!

784
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,276
Yes, I know.

785
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,654
I went to see your mother
to ask where you've gone.

786
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:41,326
Since you never answered my note,
I was afraid you might be ill.

787
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,996
Well, he was in such a rush to get married,
that's why.

788
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:45,998
Fresh off the train, and straight here.

789
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:50,502
He wants me to use all my influence
just to marry his sweetheart sooner.

790
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:55,716
Well, surely, Granny, between us,

791
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,343
we can persuade the Wellands
to do as he wishes.

792
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:01,722
There, Newland, you see?
Right to the quick of the problem, like me.

793
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:04,224
I told him he should have married you.

794
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:07,728
And what did he say?

795
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:09,229
Oh, my darling,

796
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:11,315
I leave you to find that out.

797
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:19,948
I wish I didn't have to leave.

798
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,950
I shall see you very soon, I hope.

799
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,201
Fine.

800
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:26,371
I'll see you out.

801
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,875
When can I see you?

802
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:52,105
The Struthers
are sending the carriage at 7:00.

803
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:57,903
Good evening.

804
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:01,740
Who's ridiculous enough
to send me a bouquet?

805
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:04,618
I'm not going to a ball, and I'm not engaged.

806
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:05,952
Nastasia!

807
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:09,498
Some people are always ridiculous.
Take these to that nice family

808
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:10,749
down the street.

809
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:20,509
Well, I'll tell you,
in almost everything she says,

810
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:23,762
there's something true
and something untrue.

811
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:27,307
Why? What has Granny been telling you?

812
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:31,895
I think she believes
you might go back to your husband.

813
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:37,734
I think she believes
you might at least consider it.

814
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:40,862
A lot of things have been believed of me.

815
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:43,949
But if she thinks I would consider it,

816
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:46,910
that also means she would consider it for me,

817
01:01:46,994 --> 01:01:51,123
as Granny is weighing your idea
of advancing the marriage.

818
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:04,469
May and I had a frank talk in Florida.

819
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:08,974
It's probably our first.

820
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,645
She wants a long engagement,
to give me time.

821
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:17,858
Time for what?

822
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:22,320
She thinks I want to marry her at once...

823
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:27,993
To get away from someone that I care for

824
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,244
more.

825
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:37,210
Time to give her up for another woman?

826
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:40,505
If I want to.

827
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,176
That's very noble.

828
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:45,343
Yes.

829
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:48,180
But it's ridiculous.

830
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:50,849
Why?

831
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:54,603
Because there is no other woman?

832
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:55,771
No.

833
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:58,690
Because I don't mean to marry anyone else.

834
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:09,618
This other woman, does she love you too?

835
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:13,872
There is no other woman!
The person May was thinking of was never...

836
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:23,673
That must be your carriage.

837
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:25,050
Yes, I...

838
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:29,471
I suppose I should be leaving soon.

839
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:34,768
To Mrs Struthers'?

840
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:41,650
Yes. I must go where I'm invited,
or I should be too lonely.

841
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:49,074
Why not come with me?

842
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:15,100
May guessed the truth.

843
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:20,230
There is another woman.

844
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,736
Only, not the one she thinks.

845
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:34,035
Don't make love to me,
too many people have done that.

846
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,328
I've never made love to you.

847
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:36,705
But you are the woman I would've married

848
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:38,081
if it had been possible for either of us.

849
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:40,208
You can say that when you're the one
who's made it impossible?

850
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:43,253
- I've made it?
- Isn't it you who made me give up divorcing?

851
01:04:43,337 --> 01:04:48,592
Didn't you talk to me here, in this house,
about sacrifice and sparing scandal?

852
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:51,303
And for May's sake, and for yours,
I did what you asked me!

853
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:53,305
There were things in your husband's letter...

854
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:56,182
I had nothing to fear from that letter,
absolutely nothing.

855
01:04:56,642 --> 01:05:00,353
I was just afraid of scandal
for the family and you and May.

856
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:06,985
Ellen.

857
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:10,447
Ellen.

858
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:13,533
Nothing's...

859
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:16,828
Nothing's done that can't be undone.

860
01:05:17,663 --> 01:05:19,164
I'm still free.

861
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:23,668
You can be, too.

862
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:27,088
Please, Ellen.

863
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:10,674
Lord, can I marry May now?
Do you see me marrying May now?

864
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:13,176
I don't see you putting that question to May,
do you?

865
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:14,636
But I have to.

866
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,054
It's too late to do anything else.

867
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:18,723
You say that because it's the easiest thing
to say at this moment,

868
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,350
not because it's true.

869
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:22,060
I don't understand you.

870
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:24,854
You don't understand
because you don't yet realise

871
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:27,482
how you've changed things for me.

872
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:29,693
You don't know all that you've done.

873
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:30,819
All I've done?

874
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:35,115
All the good things you've done for me,
Newland, that I never knew.

875
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:38,952
Going to the van der Luydens'
because people refused to meet me.

876
01:06:39,036 --> 01:06:41,496
Announcing your engagement at the ball
so there would be

877
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:44,916
two families standing behind me
instead of one.

878
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:48,753
I never understood
how dreadful people thought I was.

879
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:51,339
Granny blurted it out one day.

880
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:53,883
I was stupid. I never thought...

881
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:56,469
New York meant freedom to me.

882
01:06:56,554 --> 01:07:00,432
Everyone seemed so kind,
and glad to see me.

883
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:06,021
But they never knew
what it meant to be tempted,

884
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:08,231
but you did, you understood.

885
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:11,568
I'd never known that before.

886
01:07:12,903 --> 01:07:15,697
And it's better than anything I've known.

887
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:25,415
Newland, you couldn't be happy
if it meant being cruel.

888
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,251
If we act any other way,

889
01:07:28,335 --> 01:07:31,796
I'll be making you act
against what I love in you most.

890
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:36,051
And I can't go back to that way of thinking.

891
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:41,139
Don't you see?
I can't love you, unless I give you up.

892
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:25,767
"Ellen, Granny's telegram was successful.

893
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:29,771
"Grandma and Mamma agreed
to marriage after Easter, only a month.

894
01:08:29,855 --> 01:08:33,733
"I will telegraph Newland.
I'm too happy for words, and love you dearly.

895
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:35,944
"Your grateful cousin, May. "

896
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:58,967
There had been wild rumours
right up to the wedding day

897
01:08:59,051 --> 01:09:02,428
that Mrs Mingott
would actually attend the ceremony.

898
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:06,808
It was known that she had sent a carpenter
to measure the front pew,

899
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:09,978
in case it might be altered
to accommodate her.

900
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:14,524
But this idea, like the great lady herself,
proved to be unwieldy,

901
01:09:14,608 --> 01:09:17,777
and she settled
for giving the wedding-breakfast.

902
01:09:19,363 --> 01:09:22,115
The Countess Olenska sent her regrets.

903
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:24,450
She was travelling with an aunt.

904
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:29,289
But gave the bride and groom
an exquisite piece of old lace.

905
01:09:29,373 --> 01:09:33,751
Two elderly aunts in Rhinebeck
offered a honeymoon cottage.

906
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:38,882
And, since it was thought very English
to have a country house on loan,

907
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:41,676
their offer was accepted.

908
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:45,638
When the house
proved suddenly uninhabitable, however,

909
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:49,142
Henry van der Luyden
stepped in to offer an old cottage

910
01:09:49,226 --> 01:09:52,478
on his property nearby.

911
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:56,107
May accepted the offer
as a surprise for her husband.

912
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,984
She'd never seen the house,

913
01:09:58,068 --> 01:10:00,695
but her cousin, Ellen, had mentioned it once.

914
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:03,907
She had said it was the only house
in America

915
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:06,993
where she could imagine
being perfectly happy.

916
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:13,833
They travelled to the expected places,
which May had never seen.

917
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:16,711
In London, Archer ordered his clothes.

918
01:10:16,795 --> 01:10:20,173
And they went to the National Gallery,
and sometimes to the theatre.

919
01:10:20,257 --> 01:10:22,342
I hope I don't look ridiculous.

920
01:10:22,426 --> 01:10:25,178
I've never dined out in London.

921
01:10:25,262 --> 01:10:28,514
English women dress just like
everybody else in the evening, don't they?

922
01:10:28,599 --> 01:10:30,767
How can you say that
when they're always at the theatre

923
01:10:30,851 --> 01:10:33,728
in old ball dresses and bare heads?

924
01:10:33,812 --> 01:10:37,232
Well, maybe they save their new dresses
for home.

925
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:38,524
Then I shouldn't have worn this.

926
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:40,985
No, you look very fine.

927
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:44,656
Really quite beautiful.

928
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:53,706
In Paris, she ordered her clothes.

929
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:56,584
There were trunks of dresses from Worth.

930
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:58,753
They visited the Tuileries.

931
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:10,932
May's hands were modelled in marble
at Roche's studio.

932
01:11:11,016 --> 01:11:13,434
And occasionally, they dined out.

933
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:21,484
But tell me. You were saying that you were
actually advised here by Maupassant?

934
01:11:21,568 --> 01:11:25,697
Yes. Unfortunately,
I was advised not to write.

935
01:11:29,326 --> 01:11:31,244
Archer embraced his new marriage,

936
01:11:31,328 --> 01:11:35,707
even as he reverted
to his old inherited ideas about matrimony.

937
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:39,877
It was less trouble to conform with tradition.

938
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:42,547
There was no use trying to emancipate a wife

939
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:45,425
who hadn't the dimmest notion
that she was not free.

940
01:11:45,509 --> 01:11:46,509
When we were in London,

941
01:11:46,593 --> 01:11:48,845
we could only manage one day
at the National.

942
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:52,223
We were taken up
by a Mrs Carfry and Mrs Harle...

943
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:56,060
We had an awfully good talk.
He's an interesting fellow.

944
01:11:56,186 --> 01:11:59,355
We talked about books,
and many different things.

945
01:12:00,899 --> 01:12:02,984
I thought I'd invite him to dinner.

946
01:12:03,068 --> 01:12:05,028
- The Frenchman?
- Yes.

947
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:07,113
I didn't have much chance to talk to him,

948
01:12:07,197 --> 01:12:09,991
but wasn't he a little common?

949
01:12:10,075 --> 01:12:11,242
Common?

950
01:12:12,619 --> 01:12:15,204
I thought he was clever.

951
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:18,499
I suppose I shouldn't have known
if he was clever.

952
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:24,714
Then, I won't ask him to dine.

953
01:12:27,384 --> 01:12:30,928
With a chill, he knew that in future,

954
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:35,099
many problems
would be solved for him in this same way.

955
01:12:37,728 --> 01:12:42,023
The first six months of marriage
were usually said to be the hardest.

956
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:44,108
And after that, he thought they would have

957
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:48,112
pretty nearly finished
polishing down all the rough edges.

958
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:50,907
But May's pressure
was already wearing down

959
01:12:50,991 --> 01:12:54,660
the very roughness he most wanted to keep.

960
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:57,246
As for the madness with Madame Olenska,

961
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:59,499
Archer trained himself to remember it

962
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:03,378
as the last of his discarded experiments.

963
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:07,507
She remained in his memory
simply as the most plaintive,

964
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:10,802
and poignant of a line of ghosts.

965
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:46,963
She's very deft.

966
01:13:47,047 --> 01:13:50,675
Yes, well,
that's the only kind of target she'll ever hit.

967
01:13:57,224 --> 01:14:00,268
No one could ever be jealous
of May's triumphs.

968
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:02,937
She managed
to give the feeling that she would have been

969
01:14:03,021 --> 01:14:05,148
just as serene without them.

970
01:14:08,318 --> 01:14:11,946
But what if all her calm, her niceness,

971
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:13,865
were just a negation,

972
01:14:14,366 --> 01:14:17,702
a curtain dropped in front of an emptiness?

973
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:21,372
Archer felt
he had never yet lifted that curtain.

974
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:25,877
Quite stunning, isn't it?

975
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:30,506
It's Julius Beaufort
who donates the club's prizes, isn't it?

976
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:32,800
This looks like him, of course.

977
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:35,011
It will make quite an heirloom, my dear.

978
01:14:35,095 --> 01:14:38,389
You should leave it to your eldest daughter.

979
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:42,018
What's the matter? Aren't there going
to be any daughters? Only sons?

980
01:14:42,102 --> 01:14:43,769
What, can't I say that either?

981
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:45,396
Look at her blushing.

982
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:48,983
Ellen! Ellen, are you upstairs?

983
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:51,944
She's over from Portsmouth,
spending the day with me.

984
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:55,323
It's such a nuisance.
She just won't stay in Newport.

985
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:59,577
Insists on putting up with those...
What's their names? Blenkers.

986
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:04,081
But I gave up arguing
with young people 50 years ago. Ellen!

987
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:05,249
I'm sorry, ma'am.

988
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:07,627
Miss Ellen's not in the house.

989
01:15:07,711 --> 01:15:08,878
She's left?

990
01:15:08,962 --> 01:15:11,506
I saw her going down the shore path.

991
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:16,677
Run down and fetch her
like a good grandson.

992
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:19,388
May and I
will have a gossip about Julius Beaufort.

993
01:15:19,556 --> 01:15:22,308
Go ahead.
I know she'll want to see you both.

994
01:15:22,976 --> 01:15:26,437
Is it true Beaufort
has given Annie Ring a diamond bracelet?

995
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:29,524
I hear he even plans to bring her to Newport.

996
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,450
He had heard her name often enough

997
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:42,578
during the year and a half
since they had last met.

998
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:46,707
He was even familiar
with the main incidents of her life.

999
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:50,419
But he heard
all these accounts with detachment,

1000
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:54,590
as if listening
to reminiscences of someone long-dead.

1001
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:59,178
But the past
had come again into the present,

1002
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:02,640
as in those newly-discovered caverns
in Tuscany,

1003
01:16:02,766 --> 01:16:05,726
where children had lit bunches of straw,

1004
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:09,730
and seen old images staring from the wall.

1005
01:16:20,617 --> 01:16:23,244
He gave himself a single chance.

1006
01:16:23,328 --> 01:16:27,415
She must turn before the sailboat
crosses the lime rock light.

1007
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:30,668
Then, he would go to her.

1008
01:17:20,552 --> 01:17:23,971
I'm sorry you didn't find her,
but I've heard she's so changed.

1009
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:25,139
Changed?

1010
01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:27,141
So indifferent to her old friends,

1011
01:17:27,225 --> 01:17:30,978
summering in Portsmouth,
moving to Washington.

1012
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:33,606
Sometimes, I think we've always bored her.

1013
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:36,817
I wonder if she wouldn't be happier
with her husband after all.

1014
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:39,445
I don't think
I've ever heard you be cruel before.

1015
01:17:39,529 --> 01:17:40,821
Cruel?

1016
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:44,825
Even demons
don't think people are happier in Hell.

1017
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:47,703
Then she shouldn't have married abroad.

1018
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:50,122
Here, let me. Go on. Walk on.

1019
01:17:50,582 --> 01:17:53,918
The Blenkers? A party for the Blenkers?

1020
01:17:54,878 --> 01:17:56,379
Who are they?

1021
01:17:56,963 --> 01:18:00,633
The Portsmouth people, I think.
The ones Countess Olenska is staying with.

1022
01:18:00,717 --> 01:18:04,887
"Professor and Mrs Emerson Sillerton
request the pleasure Wednesday afternoon,

1023
01:18:04,971 --> 01:18:09,183
"At 3:00 o'clock, punctually
to meet Mrs and the Misses Blenker.

1024
01:18:09,267 --> 01:18:11,477
"Red gables, Catherine Street. "

1025
01:18:11,561 --> 01:18:13,771
I don't think we can decline.

1026
01:18:14,606 --> 01:18:18,150
I don't see why, really. He's an archaeologist.

1027
01:18:18,235 --> 01:18:21,112
And he's Sillerton Jackson's cousin.

1028
01:18:22,155 --> 01:18:23,364
Of course.

1029
01:18:23,448 --> 01:18:25,116
Some of us will have to go.

1030
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:28,285
I'll go over.
And, Janey, why don't you come with me?

1031
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:32,623
I'm sure Cousin Ellen will be there.
It will give you a chance to see her.

1032
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:37,086
Newland, you can find a way
to spend your afternoon, can't you?

1033
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:41,090
I think for a change,
I'll just save it instead of spending it.

1034
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:46,887
Maybe I'll drive to the farm
to see about a new horse for the brougham.

1035
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:52,268
Well, at least the Jacksons didn't choose
the day of the Cup Race for their party.

1036
01:18:52,352 --> 01:18:54,562
Of course,
I shouldn't be surprised if they had.

1037
01:20:07,511 --> 01:20:08,677
Hello?

1038
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:15,935
I'm sorry. Did you ring?
I've been asleep in the hammock.

1039
01:20:19,105 --> 01:20:21,398
Well, I didn't mean to disturb you.

1040
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:24,193
Are you Miss Blenker? I'm Newland Archer.

1041
01:20:24,569 --> 01:20:26,695
Yes. I've heard so much about you.

1042
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:29,323
I came to the island to look for a new horse.

1043
01:20:29,407 --> 01:20:31,659
I thought I'd call,
but the house seems to be empty.

1044
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:33,744
It is empty. They're all at the party.

1045
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:38,457
Everyone's there, but me with my fever,
and Countess Olenska.

1046
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:41,252
You found my parasol.

1047
01:20:43,588 --> 01:20:46,423
It's my best one. It's from the Cameroons.

1048
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:49,134
Well, it's very pretty.

1049
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:50,886
The Countess was called away?

1050
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:53,430
Yes. A telegram came from Boston.

1051
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:56,058
She said she might be gone for two days.

1052
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:59,311
I do love
the way she does her hair, don't you?

1053
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:01,814
It reminds me of Sir Walter Scott.

1054
01:21:04,025 --> 01:21:07,444
You don't know... I'm sorry,
but I have to be in Boston tomorrow.

1055
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:10,489
You wouldn't happen to know
where she was staying?

1056
01:21:43,523 --> 01:21:44,732
Ellen.

1057
01:21:44,816 --> 01:21:48,068
I'm here on business.
I just got here, actually.

1058
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:00,581
You're doing your hair differently.

1059
01:22:00,665 --> 01:22:02,583
Only because my maid's not with me.

1060
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:07,338
She stayed back in Portsmouth. I'm here only
for two days. It didn't seem worthwhile.

1061
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:09,506
You are travelling alone?

1062
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:11,592
Yes.

1063
01:22:11,676 --> 01:22:15,012
Why? Do you think it's a little dangerous?

1064
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:17,222
Well, it's unconventional.

1065
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:18,515
Yes, I suppose it is.

1066
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:22,019
I've just done
something so much more unconventional.

1067
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:25,189
I refused
to take back money that belonged to me.

1068
01:22:27,484 --> 01:22:29,360
Someone came with an offer?

1069
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:34,531
What were the conditions?

1070
01:22:35,825 --> 01:22:37,368
I refused.

1071
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:39,954
- Tell me the conditions.
- Nothing unbearable, really.

1072
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:43,374
Just to sit at the head
of his table now and then.

1073
01:22:45,877 --> 01:22:48,379
And he wants you back at any price?

1074
01:22:49,255 --> 01:22:51,840
Well, it's a considerable price.

1075
01:22:53,176 --> 01:22:55,678
At least, it's considerable for me.

1076
01:22:57,305 --> 01:22:58,806
So, you came to see him?

1077
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:02,643
My husband? Here? No, of course not.

1078
01:23:02,727 --> 01:23:04,520
No. He sent someone.

1079
01:23:06,314 --> 01:23:07,648
His secretary?

1080
01:23:09,943 --> 01:23:11,276
Yes.

1081
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:14,947
He's still here, in fact.

1082
01:23:15,031 --> 01:23:19,118
He insisted on waiting,
in case I changed my mind.

1083
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:27,334
You haven't changed, Newland.

1084
01:23:31,297 --> 01:23:33,841
I had changed until I saw you again.

1085
01:23:35,093 --> 01:23:36,176
Please don't.

1086
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:38,637
Just give me the day.
I'll say anything you like, or nothing.

1087
01:23:38,722 --> 01:23:41,849
I won't speak unless you tell me to.

1088
01:23:41,933 --> 01:23:44,309
All I want is some time with you.

1089
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,896
I want to get you away from that man.
Is he coming to hotel?

1090
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:50,315
- At 11:00...
- Well, let's go now.

1091
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:57,948
I'll have to leave a note at the hotel.

1092
01:23:58,033 --> 01:23:59,533
Write on this. I have the paper.

1093
01:23:59,617 --> 01:24:02,745
You see how everything is predestined?

1094
01:24:02,829 --> 01:24:06,540
And these? Have you seen these?
The new stylographic pen.

1095
01:24:06,624 --> 01:24:07,708
It's just like...

1096
01:24:07,792 --> 01:24:12,171
It's like jerking down the mercury
in a thermometer. Now.

1097
01:24:12,922 --> 01:24:14,173
Try that.

1098
01:24:15,675 --> 01:24:17,301
It's not working.

1099
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:20,429
That should do it.

1100
01:24:21,973 --> 01:24:24,850
- Shall I take it in?
- I'll be only a moment.

1101
01:25:06,851 --> 01:25:11,105
Why didn't you come down to the beach
to get me the day I was at Granny's?

1102
01:25:11,189 --> 01:25:13,774
Because you didn't turn around. I swore...

1103
01:25:15,819 --> 01:25:19,029
I swore I wouldn't call you
unless you turned around.

1104
01:25:19,823 --> 01:25:22,241
But I didn't look around on purpose.

1105
01:25:23,868 --> 01:25:25,327
You knew?

1106
01:25:25,411 --> 01:25:28,080
I recognised the carriage when you drove in.

1107
01:25:29,249 --> 01:25:31,416
So, I went to the beach.

1108
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:34,378
To get as far away from me as you could.

1109
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:35,879
As I could, yes.

1110
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:38,507
Well, you see, it's no use.
It's better if we face each other.

1111
01:25:38,591 --> 01:25:40,467
I only want to be honest with you.

1112
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:43,428
Honest? Isn't that why
you always admired Julius Beaufort?

1113
01:25:43,513 --> 01:25:47,141
He was more honest than the rest
of us, wasn't he? We've no character.

1114
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:49,476
No colour, no variety.

1115
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:54,314
I don't know
why you don't just go back to Europe.

1116
01:25:55,275 --> 01:25:58,068
- I believe that's because of you.
- Me?

1117
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:01,530
I'm the man who married one woman
because another one told him to.

1118
01:26:04,868 --> 01:26:07,619
You promised not to say such things today.

1119
01:26:07,954 --> 01:26:10,205
I can't keep that promise.

1120
01:26:10,290 --> 01:26:13,500
What about May? What about how May feels?

1121
01:26:13,585 --> 01:26:16,670
If you're using my marriage
as some victory of ours,

1122
01:26:16,754 --> 01:26:20,424
then there's really no reason on earth
why you shouldn't go back.

1123
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:24,595
You gave me my first glimpse of a real life.

1124
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:27,890
And then you told me
to carry on with a false one.

1125
01:26:30,518 --> 01:26:32,436
No one can endure that.

1126
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:37,482
I'm enduring it.

1127
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:49,203
What's the use? I know you'll go back.

1128
01:26:49,287 --> 01:26:51,830
I won't. Not yet.

1129
01:26:53,291 --> 01:26:55,000
Not as long as we both can stand it.

1130
01:26:55,084 --> 01:26:56,543
This is not a life for you.

1131
01:26:57,378 --> 01:27:00,255
It is, as long as it's part of yours.

1132
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:16,897
You won't go back?

1133
01:27:18,524 --> 01:27:20,150
I won't go back.

1134
01:27:26,991 --> 01:27:29,201
He would see her again.

1135
01:27:29,285 --> 01:27:31,995
At the theatre, or a reception.

1136
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:35,040
Perhaps he might be seated next to her.

1137
01:27:35,124 --> 01:27:39,002
Perhaps they might
have another time alone, somewhere.

1138
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:42,381
But he could not live without seeing her.

1139
01:28:26,092 --> 01:28:27,718
Mr Archer, I think.

1140
01:28:28,344 --> 01:28:29,386
Yes.

1141
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:31,972
My name is Riviere.

1142
01:28:32,056 --> 01:28:33,974
I dined with you in Paris last year.

1143
01:28:34,058 --> 01:28:36,727
Yes. I'm sorry. I didn't quite recall.

1144
01:28:36,811 --> 01:28:41,606
Quite all right. I had the advantage.
I saw you in Boston yesterday.

1145
01:28:45,486 --> 01:28:47,696
I came here on Count Olenski's behalf.

1146
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:52,367
Because I believed in all good faith
that she should return to him.

1147
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:54,619
Forgive me.

1148
01:28:54,704 --> 01:28:57,456
Forgive me, monsieur,

1149
01:28:57,540 --> 01:29:01,001
but I really don't understand your purpose

1150
01:29:01,085 --> 01:29:02,836
in coming to see me.

1151
01:29:04,505 --> 01:29:06,465
She's changed, monsieur.

1152
01:29:07,842 --> 01:29:09,384
You knew her before?

1153
01:29:10,136 --> 01:29:12,679
I used to see her
at her husband's house, yes.

1154
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:15,349
Well, the count would not
have entrusted my mission to a stranger.

1155
01:29:15,433 --> 01:29:19,227
This change that you mentioned.

1156
01:29:19,312 --> 01:29:23,440
It may only have been my seeing her
for the first time,

1157
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:26,777
as she is, as an American.

1158
01:29:26,861 --> 01:29:29,404
She made her marriage in good faith.

1159
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:33,533
It was a faith the Count could not share,

1160
01:29:33,618 --> 01:29:35,410
could not understand.

1161
01:29:36,162 --> 01:29:39,206
So, her faith was...

1162
01:29:39,290 --> 01:29:40,624
Detruit?

1163
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:44,211
- Broken. Destroyed.
- Destroyed.

1164
01:29:46,130 --> 01:29:50,801
Returning to Europe
would mean a life of some comfort,

1165
01:29:50,885 --> 01:29:54,513
and considerable sacrifice.

1166
01:29:54,597 --> 01:29:56,723
And, I would think, no hope.

1167
01:29:58,518 --> 01:30:02,396
I will, of course,
fulfil my obligation to the Count,

1168
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:03,563
and meet with the family.

1169
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:08,235
I will tell them everything that he suggests,
and wishes for the Countess.

1170
01:30:08,319 --> 01:30:12,155
But I would ask you to use your influence
with them.

1171
01:30:14,492 --> 01:30:17,452
I beg you, monsieur. Do not let her go back.

1172
01:30:20,456 --> 01:30:23,083
When old Mrs Baxter Pennilow died,

1173
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:24,751
they found her standing order,

1174
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:28,922
48 Worth dresses,
still wrapped in tissue paper.

1175
01:30:29,006 --> 01:30:31,758
When her daughters left off their mourning,

1176
01:30:31,843 --> 01:30:34,553
they wore the first lot to the symphony

1177
01:30:34,637 --> 01:30:37,848
without looking in advance of the fashion.

1178
01:30:38,641 --> 01:30:42,102
He had written to her once in Washington,

1179
01:30:42,186 --> 01:30:45,689
just a few lines asking
when they would meet again.

1180
01:30:47,024 --> 01:30:50,026
And she wrote back, "Not yet. "

1181
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:53,780
And even that had the front panel changed.

1182
01:30:53,865 --> 01:30:57,117
No, I think it was Julius Beaufort
who started the new fashion.

1183
01:30:57,201 --> 01:31:01,121
By making his wife clap her new clothes
on her back as soon as they arrived.

1184
01:31:01,205 --> 01:31:05,459
I must say, it takes
all Regina's distinction not to look like...

1185
01:31:05,543 --> 01:31:07,169
Her rivals?

1186
01:31:07,253 --> 01:31:08,712
Like that Annie Ring.

1187
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,422
Careful, dear.

1188
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:12,257
Everybody knows.

1189
01:31:12,341 --> 01:31:13,633
Indeed.

1190
01:31:13,718 --> 01:31:15,886
Beaufort always put his business around.

1191
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:19,347
And now that his business is gone,
there are bound to be disclosures.

1192
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:21,433
Gone? Is it really that bad?

1193
01:31:21,517 --> 01:31:24,102
As bad as anything I ever heard of.

1194
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:27,606
Most everybody we know will be hit
one way or another.

1195
01:31:32,111 --> 01:31:35,989
Very difficult for Regina, of course.
And, it's a pity.

1196
01:31:36,073 --> 01:31:39,910
It's certainly a pity that Countess Olenska
refused her husband's offer.

1197
01:31:40,912 --> 01:31:42,496
Why, for God's sake?

1198
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:44,164
Well, to put it on the lowest ground,

1199
01:31:44,248 --> 01:31:46,374
- what's she going to live on now?
- Live on?

1200
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:47,918
I mean, now that Beaufort...

1201
01:31:48,252 --> 01:31:50,712
What the hell does that mean, sir?

1202
01:31:55,092 --> 01:31:58,220
Most of her money's invested with Beaufort.

1203
01:31:58,304 --> 01:32:01,681
And the allowance she's been getting
from the family is so cut back.

1204
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:02,849
I'm sure she has something.

1205
01:32:02,934 --> 01:32:04,351
I would think a little.

1206
01:32:04,644 --> 01:32:07,604
Whatever remains after sustaining more debt.

1207
01:32:08,648 --> 01:32:11,608
I know the family paid close attention
to Monsieur Riviere,

1208
01:32:11,692 --> 01:32:14,110
and considered the Count's offer
very carefully.

1209
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:16,196
If everyone had rather
she be Beaufort's mistress

1210
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:19,115
than some decent fellow's wife,
you've all gone about it perfectly.

1211
01:32:21,619 --> 01:32:23,245
She won't go back.

1212
01:32:25,623 --> 01:32:27,624
That's your opinion, eh?

1213
01:32:28,918 --> 01:32:31,002
Well, no doubt you know.

1214
01:32:33,589 --> 01:32:36,091
I suppose she might still soften
Catherine Mingott,

1215
01:32:36,175 --> 01:32:38,301
who could give her
any allowance she chooses,

1216
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:41,846
but the rest of the family have no particular
interest in keeping her here.

1217
01:32:41,973 --> 01:32:44,391
They'll simply let her...

1218
01:32:44,475 --> 01:32:46,226
Find her own level.

1219
01:32:53,859 --> 01:32:55,318
Evening, sir.

1220
01:32:59,156 --> 01:33:00,824
Thank you, Martin.

1221
01:33:07,081 --> 01:33:10,166
That lamp is smoking again.
The servant should see to it.

1222
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:11,585
I'm sorry.

1223
01:33:19,677 --> 01:33:22,554
I may have to go to Washington
for a few days.

1224
01:33:22,638 --> 01:33:24,514
When?

1225
01:33:24,599 --> 01:33:27,684
Tomorrow. I'm sorry.
I should have said it before.

1226
01:33:28,603 --> 01:33:29,936
On business?

1227
01:33:30,021 --> 01:33:32,022
On business, of course.
There's a patent case

1228
01:33:32,106 --> 01:33:33,898
coming up before the Supreme Court.

1229
01:33:33,983 --> 01:33:36,109
I just got the papers from Letterblair.

1230
01:33:36,193 --> 01:33:37,277
It seems that he intended...

1231
01:33:37,361 --> 01:33:40,155
Never mind. It sounds too complicated.

1232
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:42,198
I have enough trouble managing this lamp.

1233
01:33:42,283 --> 01:33:44,451
Let me try that.

1234
01:33:44,535 --> 01:33:47,287
But the change will do you good.

1235
01:33:47,371 --> 01:33:50,206
And you must be sure to go and see Ellen.

1236
01:33:57,131 --> 01:33:59,257
Excuse me, ma'am,
but this came for you while you were out.

1237
01:34:01,344 --> 01:34:03,136
Do something about this, will you, Alice?

1238
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:04,721
Certainly, sir.

1239
01:34:07,725 --> 01:34:09,601
Granny's had a stroke.

1240
01:34:12,063 --> 01:34:14,064
A stroke?

1241
01:34:14,148 --> 01:34:16,066
Ridiculous.

1242
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:19,944
I told them all,
it was just an excessive Thanksgiving.

1243
01:34:22,031 --> 01:34:27,410
Dr Bencomb acted most concerned
and insisted on notifying everyone.

1244
01:34:27,495 --> 01:34:30,705
As if it were the last reading of my will
and testament.

1245
01:34:30,790 --> 01:34:32,123
You're very dear to come.

1246
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:36,419
But perhaps you only wanted to see
what I'd left you.

1247
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:38,088
Granny, that's shocking!

1248
01:34:38,172 --> 01:34:40,799
It was shock that did this to me.

1249
01:34:40,883 --> 01:34:44,219
No. It's all due to Regina Beaufort.

1250
01:34:45,596 --> 01:34:49,432
She came here last night,
and she asked me...

1251
01:34:50,309 --> 01:34:54,729
She asked me... She had the effrontery

1252
01:34:54,814 --> 01:34:58,316
to ask me to back Julius.

1253
01:34:58,401 --> 01:35:01,361
Not to desert him, she said.

1254
01:35:01,445 --> 01:35:05,824
To stand behind our common lineage
in the Townsend family.

1255
01:35:06,617 --> 01:35:10,453
If you back Julius,
you can see the family through.

1256
01:35:11,747 --> 01:35:13,707
If you don't,

1257
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:15,917
we will all,

1258
01:35:16,001 --> 01:35:18,712
every one of us, fall into dishonour.

1259
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:20,964
I said to her...

1260
01:35:21,048 --> 01:35:23,883
Honour's always been honour.

1261
01:35:23,968 --> 01:35:27,387
And honesty's always been honesty
in Manson Mingott's house.

1262
01:35:27,471 --> 01:35:31,516
And will be, till I'm carried out feet-first.

1263
01:35:32,643 --> 01:35:37,397
And then she said, if you can believe this,
"But my name, Auntie. "

1264
01:35:37,732 --> 01:35:39,941
But my name, Auntie.

1265
01:35:40,025 --> 01:35:42,235
My name's Regina Townsend.

1266
01:35:42,319 --> 01:35:43,403
And I said to her...

1267
01:35:43,487 --> 01:35:47,073
Your name was Beaufort
when he covered you with jewels,

1268
01:35:47,158 --> 01:35:51,327
and it's got to stay Beaufort,
now that he's covered you with shame.

1269
01:35:53,914 --> 01:35:55,665
And then I gave out,

1270
01:35:57,168 --> 01:35:59,544
simply gave out.

1271
01:35:59,628 --> 01:36:02,589
And now family is arriving from all over,

1272
01:36:02,673 --> 01:36:06,217
expecting a funeral,
and they'll have to be entertained.

1273
01:36:06,302 --> 01:36:09,012
I don't know
how many notes Bencomb sent out.

1274
01:36:09,096 --> 01:36:13,641
- If there's anything we can do to help out...
- Well, my Ellen is coming.

1275
01:36:13,726 --> 01:36:16,019
I expressly asked for her.

1276
01:36:16,103 --> 01:36:19,230
She arrives this afternoon on the train.
If you could fetch her...

1277
01:36:19,315 --> 01:36:23,026
Of course. If May will send the brougham,
I'll take the ferry.

1278
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:25,695
Fine. Fine. Thank you.

1279
01:36:27,156 --> 01:36:30,158
There? You see, Granny?
Everyone will be settled.

1280
01:36:30,367 --> 01:36:33,369
Thank you, dear. Bless you.

1281
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:35,955
I didn't want to worry Granny,

1282
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:38,291
but how can you meet Ellen
and bring her back here

1283
01:36:38,375 --> 01:36:41,127
if you have to go
to Washington yourself this afternoon?

1284
01:36:41,212 --> 01:36:44,047
I'm not going. The case is off, postponed.

1285
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:46,049
I heard from Letterblair this morning.

1286
01:36:46,133 --> 01:36:48,384
Postponed? How odd.

1287
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:51,513
Mama had a note
from him this morning as well.

1288
01:36:51,597 --> 01:36:55,141
He was concerned about Granny,
but had to be away.

1289
01:36:55,226 --> 01:36:58,311
He was arguing a big patent case
before the Supreme Court.

1290
01:36:58,395 --> 01:37:00,230
You did say it was a patent case, didn't you?

1291
01:37:00,314 --> 01:37:02,023
Well, that's it. The whole office can't go.

1292
01:37:02,107 --> 01:37:04,317
Letterblair decided to go himself.

1293
01:37:04,401 --> 01:37:07,195
So then, it's not postponed?

1294
01:37:07,279 --> 01:37:09,239
No, but my going is.

1295
01:37:18,499 --> 01:37:20,667
He knew it was two hours by ferry

1296
01:37:20,751 --> 01:37:25,672
and carriage from the Pennsylvania terminus
in Jersey City back to Mrs Mingott's.

1297
01:37:28,342 --> 01:37:30,385
All of two hours.

1298
01:37:30,469 --> 01:37:32,428
And maybe a little more.

1299
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:38,101
- You didn't expect me today.
- No.

1300
01:37:38,185 --> 01:37:41,646
I nearly came to Washington to see you.
We would have missed each other.

1301
01:37:41,730 --> 01:37:45,108
It was Granny Mingott who sent me.
She's much better.

1302
01:37:56,662 --> 01:37:59,205
You know, I hardly remembered you.

1303
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:00,373
Hardly remembered?

1304
01:38:00,457 --> 01:38:03,835
I mean... I mean, each time is the same.

1305
01:38:05,629 --> 01:38:07,964
You happen to me all over again.

1306
01:38:09,216 --> 01:38:11,050
Yes, I know.

1307
01:38:11,135 --> 01:38:12,677
For me, too.

1308
01:39:05,564 --> 01:39:08,399
Ellen, we can't stay like this. It can't last.

1309
01:39:09,860 --> 01:39:11,945
I think we should look at reality, not dreams.

1310
01:39:12,029 --> 01:39:13,738
I just want us to be together.

1311
01:39:13,822 --> 01:39:15,156
I can't be your wife, Newland.

1312
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:17,575
Is it your idea I should live with you
as your mistress?

1313
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:19,035
I want...

1314
01:39:19,703 --> 01:39:22,330
Somehow I want to get away with you,

1315
01:39:22,414 --> 01:39:25,041
and find a world
where words like that don't exist.

1316
01:39:25,125 --> 01:39:26,834
Oh, my dear.

1317
01:39:29,213 --> 01:39:32,298
Where is that country?
Have you ever been there?

1318
01:39:34,218 --> 01:39:37,971
Is there anywhere we can be happy
behind the backs of people who trust us?

1319
01:39:38,055 --> 01:39:39,430
I'm beyond caring about that.

1320
01:39:39,515 --> 01:39:41,766
No, you're not.

1321
01:39:41,850 --> 01:39:44,060
You've never been beyond that.

1322
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:46,229
I have.

1323
01:39:48,148 --> 01:39:51,317
I know what it looks like. It's no place for us.

1324
01:40:03,372 --> 01:40:07,041
Why are...
Why are we stopping? This isn't Granny's.

1325
01:40:07,126 --> 01:40:09,002
No. I'll get out here.

1326
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:17,051
You were right. I shouldn't have come today.

1327
01:40:58,385 --> 01:40:59,969
What are you reading?

1328
01:41:02,806 --> 01:41:04,766
It's a book about Japan.

1329
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:07,602
Why?

1330
01:41:09,354 --> 01:41:11,647
I don't know.

1331
01:41:11,732 --> 01:41:14,150
Because it's a different country.

1332
01:41:15,319 --> 01:41:17,528
You used to read poetry.

1333
01:41:17,613 --> 01:41:20,239
It was so nice when you read it to me.

1334
01:41:33,045 --> 01:41:34,337
Newland.

1335
01:41:34,588 --> 01:41:36,339
You'll catch your death.

1336
01:41:42,846 --> 01:41:44,180
Of course.

1337
01:41:45,682 --> 01:41:48,559
But then he realised, "I am dead.

1338
01:41:49,061 --> 01:41:52,438
"I've been dead for months and months. "

1339
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:55,358
Then it occurred to him that she might die.

1340
01:41:56,193 --> 01:41:59,612
People did.
Young people, healthy people did.

1341
01:42:00,364 --> 01:42:03,407
She might die and set him free.

1342
01:42:09,081 --> 01:42:10,289
Newland?

1343
01:42:25,472 --> 01:42:27,431
Ellen, I have to see you.

1344
01:42:29,601 --> 01:42:31,602
I didn't know when you were leaving again.

1345
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:32,979
I'm... I'm not leaving.

1346
01:42:33,063 --> 01:42:35,439
Granny's asked me to stay
and take care of her.

1347
01:42:35,524 --> 01:42:37,316
Then we have to talk now.

1348
01:42:37,401 --> 01:42:40,444
I'm due at Regina Beaufort's.
Granny lent me her carriage.

1349
01:42:40,529 --> 01:42:43,030
I know Granny says Julius Beaufort
is a scoundrel,

1350
01:42:43,115 --> 01:42:46,659
but so is my husband, and the family still
want me to go back to him.

1351
01:42:46,743 --> 01:42:51,164
Only Granny understands.
She's even seen to my allowance.

1352
01:42:51,623 --> 01:42:53,708
I have to see you,
somewhere we can be alone.

1353
01:42:53,792 --> 01:42:56,252
- In New York?
- Alone. Somewhere we can be alone.

1354
01:42:56,336 --> 01:42:59,338
The art museum in the park, 2:30 tomorrow.

1355
01:42:59,423 --> 01:43:01,215
I'll be at the door.

1356
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:13,519
You came to New York
because you were afraid.

1357
01:43:13,604 --> 01:43:15,688
- Afraid?
- Of my coming to Washington.

1358
01:43:15,772 --> 01:43:17,982
I thought I would be safer.

1359
01:43:18,066 --> 01:43:19,567
Safer from me?

1360
01:43:23,530 --> 01:43:24,947
Ellen?

1361
01:43:28,785 --> 01:43:29,785
S...

1362
01:43:31,830 --> 01:43:33,748
Safer from loving me?

1363
01:43:41,423 --> 01:43:44,300
Shall I come to you once and then go home?

1364
01:43:55,354 --> 01:43:57,146
Come to me once then.

1365
01:44:02,986 --> 01:44:04,070
When?

1366
01:44:07,741 --> 01:44:09,075
Tomorrow.

1367
01:44:16,166 --> 01:44:17,667
The day after.

1368
01:44:48,949 --> 01:44:52,868
I'm sorry I'm late.
You weren't worried, were you?

1369
01:44:53,787 --> 01:44:55,162
Is it late?

1370
01:44:55,247 --> 01:44:56,789
It's past 7:00.

1371
01:44:56,873 --> 01:44:59,834
I stayed at Granny's
because Cousin Ellen came in.

1372
01:44:59,918 --> 01:45:04,714
We had a wonderful talk.
She was so dear, just like the old Ellen.

1373
01:45:04,798 --> 01:45:07,591
Granny was so charmed by her.

1374
01:45:07,676 --> 01:45:11,012
But you can see, though, how the family's
been annoyed with her at times.

1375
01:45:11,138 --> 01:45:14,056
Going to see Regina Beaufort
in Granny's carriage and...

1376
01:45:14,141 --> 01:45:16,183
Are we dining out tonight?

1377
01:45:20,355 --> 01:45:22,481
You haven't kissed me today.

1378
01:45:38,540 --> 01:45:41,208
It was the custom in old New York

1379
01:45:41,293 --> 01:45:43,794
for brides to appear in their wedding dress

1380
01:45:43,879 --> 01:45:46,922
during the first year or two of marriage.

1381
01:45:47,007 --> 01:45:49,342
But May, since returning from Europe,

1382
01:45:49,426 --> 01:45:52,678
had not worn her bridal satin
untiI this evening.

1383
01:46:35,889 --> 01:46:38,808
May, I'm sorry. My head's bursting.

1384
01:46:38,892 --> 01:46:41,977
Please don't tell anyone.
Come home with me now.

1385
01:46:55,075 --> 01:46:56,826
Shouldn't you rest?

1386
01:46:58,245 --> 01:47:01,080
My head's not as bad as that.

1387
01:47:01,164 --> 01:47:05,167
And there's something important
I have to say to you right away.

1388
01:47:26,815 --> 01:47:30,025
May, there is something
that I've got to tell you.

1389
01:47:31,695 --> 01:47:33,362
About myself.

1390
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:39,535
Madame Olenska...

1391
01:47:39,870 --> 01:47:42,204
Why should we talk about Ellen tonight?

1392
01:47:44,708 --> 01:47:47,209
Because I should have spoken before and...

1393
01:47:47,294 --> 01:47:48,919
Is it really worthwhile, dear?

1394
01:47:49,337 --> 01:47:52,131
I know I've been unfair to her at times.

1395
01:47:52,215 --> 01:47:54,300
Perhaps we all have.

1396
01:47:54,384 --> 01:47:56,719
You've understood her better
than any of us, I suppose,

1397
01:47:56,803 --> 01:47:59,722
but does it really matter
now that it's all over?

1398
01:48:01,766 --> 01:48:03,476
How do you mean, "over"?

1399
01:48:04,352 --> 01:48:07,563
Why, since she's going back
to Europe so soon.

1400
01:48:08,356 --> 01:48:10,483
Granny's approved, and understands.

1401
01:48:10,567 --> 01:48:11,901
She's disappointed, of course,

1402
01:48:11,985 --> 01:48:16,238
but she's arranged to make Ellen
financially independent of the Count.

1403
01:48:16,323 --> 01:48:19,617
I... I thought you would have heard today
at your offices.

1404
01:48:33,215 --> 01:48:35,674
- It's impossible.
- Impossible?

1405
01:48:35,759 --> 01:48:38,385
Certainly she could have stayed here
with Granny's extra money,

1406
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:41,263
but I guess she's given us up, after all.

1407
01:48:42,432 --> 01:48:44,225
How do you know that?

1408
01:48:45,685 --> 01:48:49,647
From Ellen.
I told you, I saw her at Granny's yesterday.

1409
01:48:49,731 --> 01:48:51,941
And she told you that, yesterday?

1410
01:48:53,902 --> 01:48:57,446
No. She sent me a note this afternoon.

1411
01:49:02,452 --> 01:49:04,286
Do you want to see it?

1412
01:49:13,672 --> 01:49:14,964
I thought you knew.

1413
01:49:30,021 --> 01:49:33,732
"May, dear,
I have at last made Granny understand

1414
01:49:33,817 --> 01:49:37,403
"that my visit
to her could be no more than a visit,

1415
01:49:37,487 --> 01:49:39,780
"and she has been as kind
and generous as ever. "

1416
01:49:39,864 --> 01:49:43,284
"And she has been as kind
and generous as ever.

1417
01:49:43,368 --> 01:49:47,705
"She sees now that if I return to Europe,
I must live by myself.

1418
01:49:47,789 --> 01:49:52,418
"I am hurrying back to Washington
to pack up, and I saiI next week.

1419
01:49:52,502 --> 01:49:55,504
"You be must very good to Granny
when I'm gone,

1420
01:49:55,589 --> 01:49:58,173
"as good as you've always been to me.

1421
01:49:59,259 --> 01:50:02,011
"If any of my friends wish to urge me
to change my mind,

1422
01:50:02,095 --> 01:50:03,887
"please tell them it would be utterly useless. "

1423
01:50:03,972 --> 01:50:06,849
"... tell them it would be utterly useless. "

1424
01:50:17,736 --> 01:50:19,653
Why did she write this?

1425
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:24,908
I suppose
because we talked things over yesterday.

1426
01:50:25,952 --> 01:50:27,453
What things?

1427
01:50:27,537 --> 01:50:31,957
I told her that I was afraid
I hadn't always been fair to her,

1428
01:50:32,042 --> 01:50:36,795
that I hadn't always understood
how hard it must have been for her here.

1429
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:40,090
I knew you'd be the one friend she could
always count on, and I wanted her to know

1430
01:50:40,175 --> 01:50:43,469
that you and I were the same
in all of our feelings.

1431
01:50:45,472 --> 01:50:48,766
She understood why I wanted to tell her this.

1432
01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:51,352
I think she understands everything.

1433
01:51:02,614 --> 01:51:04,281
My head aches too.

1434
01:51:07,410 --> 01:51:09,620
- Good night, dear.
- Good night.

1435
01:51:28,014 --> 01:51:30,849
It was, as Mrs Archer said to Mrs Welland,

1436
01:51:30,934 --> 01:51:34,061
a great event
for a young couple to give their first dinner,

1437
01:51:34,145 --> 01:51:37,189
and it was not to be undertaken lightly.

1438
01:51:37,273 --> 01:51:38,691
There was a hired chef,

1439
01:51:38,775 --> 01:51:41,860
two borrowed footmen,
roses from Henderson's,

1440
01:51:41,945 --> 01:51:45,906
Roman punch and menus
on gilt-edged cards.

1441
01:51:45,990 --> 01:51:49,660
It was considered a particular triumph
that the van der Luydens,

1442
01:51:49,744 --> 01:51:53,330
at May's request,
stayed in the city to be present

1443
01:51:53,415 --> 01:51:57,543
at her farewell dinner
for the Countess Olenska.

1444
01:51:57,627 --> 01:52:00,713
You have to leave New York
after the disgrace...

1445
01:52:00,797 --> 01:52:03,799
Archer saw all the harmless-looking people

1446
01:52:03,883 --> 01:52:07,261
at the table as a band of quiet conspirators,

1447
01:52:08,138 --> 01:52:11,598
with himself
and Ellen the centre of their conspiracy.

1448
01:52:13,727 --> 01:52:16,353
He guessed himself
to have been for months the centre

1449
01:52:16,438 --> 01:52:19,565
of countless silently observing eyes

1450
01:52:19,649 --> 01:52:22,151
and patiently listening ears.

1451
01:52:24,404 --> 01:52:27,781
He understood that somehow the separation

1452
01:52:27,866 --> 01:52:31,785
between himself and the partner of his guilt
had been achieved.

1453
01:52:33,204 --> 01:52:37,666
And he knew that now the whole tribe
had rallied around his wife.

1454
01:52:39,669 --> 01:52:43,589
He was a prisoner
in the centre of an armed camp.

1455
01:52:44,382 --> 01:52:46,216
I wonder if they'll ever get it back.

1456
01:52:46,301 --> 01:52:47,676
Regina's not well at all,

1457
01:52:47,761 --> 01:52:50,512
but that doesn't stop Beaufort
from devoting as much time

1458
01:52:50,597 --> 01:52:52,264
to Annie Ring as he can manage.

1459
01:52:52,348 --> 01:52:53,807
The best thing Beaufort could do

1460
01:52:53,892 --> 01:52:57,770
would be to go and stay
at Regina's little place in North Carolina.

1461
01:52:57,854 --> 01:52:59,855
He could breed trotters...

1462
01:52:59,939 --> 01:53:01,607
And the key to his release

1463
01:53:01,691 --> 01:53:04,568
had been returned the day before.

1464
01:53:04,652 --> 01:53:07,070
By maiI. Unopened.

1465
01:53:08,865 --> 01:53:12,659
He may stay here as a deliberate challenge
to the outrage he's created.

1466
01:53:12,744 --> 01:53:14,828
Perhaps he'll run for public office.

1467
01:53:14,913 --> 01:53:18,081
Then will Annie Ring be his first lady?

1468
01:53:20,794 --> 01:53:22,961
Was your trip from Washington very tiring?

1469
01:53:25,256 --> 01:53:28,050
The heat on the train was dreadful.

1470
01:53:29,552 --> 01:53:31,845
But all travel has its hardships.

1471
01:53:31,930 --> 01:53:35,766
Well, whatever they may be,
they're worth it just to get away.

1472
01:53:36,935 --> 01:53:39,394
I mean to do a lot of travelling myself soon.

1473
01:53:45,401 --> 01:53:47,986
What about you, Philip?
What about a little adventure?

1474
01:53:48,071 --> 01:53:51,698
Athens and Smyrna,
maybe even Constantinople.

1475
01:53:51,783 --> 01:53:52,991
Possibly. Possibly.

1476
01:53:53,076 --> 01:53:54,993
But not Naples.

1477
01:53:55,078 --> 01:53:57,496
Dr Bencomb says there's a fever.

1478
01:53:58,373 --> 01:54:01,083
Really? A fever in Naples.

1479
01:54:02,752 --> 01:54:04,503
Well, there's always India, of course.

1480
01:54:04,587 --> 01:54:06,338
You must have three weeks
to do India properly.

1481
01:54:06,422 --> 01:54:07,798
Absolutely.

1482
01:54:10,593 --> 01:54:13,011
Beaufort may not receive
invitations any more,

1483
01:54:13,096 --> 01:54:15,848
but it's clear
he still maintains a certain position.

1484
01:54:15,932 --> 01:54:17,391
Horizontal from all I've heard.

1485
01:54:17,475 --> 01:54:19,935
If things go on like this,
we'll be seeing our children

1486
01:54:20,019 --> 01:54:24,523
fighting for invitations to swindlers' houses
and marrying Beaufort's bastards.

1487
01:54:24,607 --> 01:54:26,149
Has he got any?

1488
01:54:26,234 --> 01:54:29,653
Be careful there, gentlemen.
Draw it mild. Draw it mild.

1489
01:54:29,737 --> 01:54:34,032
Society has a history
of tolerating vulgar women after all.

1490
01:54:34,117 --> 01:54:35,826
Up to a point.

1491
01:54:35,910 --> 01:54:37,369
But once it tolerates a man of that kind,

1492
01:54:37,453 --> 01:54:40,497
- the only prospect is total disinheritance...
- Have you ever noticed

1493
01:54:40,582 --> 01:54:43,750
it's the people with the worst cooks
who are always yelling

1494
01:54:43,835 --> 01:54:47,546
about being poisoned when they dine out?

1495
01:54:47,630 --> 01:54:51,675
Lefferts used to be
a little more adept, I thought.

1496
01:54:51,759 --> 01:54:55,178
But then grace is not always required

1497
01:54:55,263 --> 01:54:57,556
as long as one knows the steps.

1498
01:55:05,857 --> 01:55:09,276
I've never heard Lefferts so abound
in the sentiments

1499
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:11,445
that adorn Christian manhood.

1500
01:55:11,529 --> 01:55:13,614
Indignation lends a scathing eloquence.

1501
01:55:13,698 --> 01:55:18,535
It's almost as effective as fear.
The pressure at home must be unrelenting.

1502
01:55:18,620 --> 01:55:21,163
I never expected to hear
such a paean to the sanctity...

1503
01:55:21,247 --> 01:55:25,751
My mother had a bronze reduction
of the Venus De Milo she wanted to give us...

1504
01:55:25,835 --> 01:55:27,794
The silent organisation

1505
01:55:27,879 --> 01:55:33,342
which held this whole small world together
was determined to put itself on record.

1506
01:55:34,844 --> 01:55:39,681
It had never for a moment questioned
the propriety of Madame Olenska's conduct.

1507
01:55:40,475 --> 01:55:43,477
It had never questioned Archer's fidelity.

1508
01:55:45,396 --> 01:55:49,942
And it had never heard of,
suspected or even conceived possible

1509
01:55:50,026 --> 01:55:51,944
anything at all to the contrary.

1510
01:55:52,028 --> 01:55:53,195
Ellen.

1511
01:55:54,989 --> 01:55:57,908
From the seamless performance of this rituaI,

1512
01:55:57,992 --> 01:56:02,412
Archer knew that New York
believed him to be Madame Olenska's lover.

1513
01:56:02,497 --> 01:56:04,706
We were discussing
the Martha Washington ball.

1514
01:56:04,791 --> 01:56:07,960
Yes, we have it during Easter week
to benefit the blind society.

1515
01:56:08,044 --> 01:56:09,169
They do excellent work.

1516
01:56:09,253 --> 01:56:11,630
Lawrence. Lawrence...

1517
01:56:11,714 --> 01:56:14,549
And he understood for the first time

1518
01:56:14,634 --> 01:56:16,969
that his wife shared the belief.

1519
01:56:26,938 --> 01:56:29,231
You must come visit me when you do.

1520
01:56:29,315 --> 01:56:33,110
I'll write you as soon as I'm settled
and let you know where I am.

1521
01:56:33,194 --> 01:56:34,987
Yes, that would be lovely.

1522
01:56:35,071 --> 01:56:36,905
Shall I see you to your carriage?

1523
01:56:38,199 --> 01:56:40,283
We are driving dear Ellen home.

1524
01:56:42,036 --> 01:56:43,245
Goodbye.

1525
01:56:44,372 --> 01:56:47,499
Good-bye.
And I'll see you very soon in Paris.

1526
01:56:47,959 --> 01:56:50,585
If you and May could come.

1527
01:56:52,088 --> 01:56:55,173
Shall we make our way
to the carriage, my dear?

1528
01:57:06,769 --> 01:57:08,311
Delightful evening, Newland.

1529
01:57:08,396 --> 01:57:09,980
Good night, Newland.

1530
01:57:10,064 --> 01:57:12,858
Good night, Sillerton. Good night, Larry.

1531
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:39,676
It did go off beautifully, didn't it?

1532
01:57:39,761 --> 01:57:40,969
Yes.

1533
01:57:43,306 --> 01:57:44,973
May I come in and talk it over?

1534
01:57:45,308 --> 01:57:48,685
Of course. But you must be very sleepy.

1535
01:57:48,770 --> 01:57:51,938
- No, I'm not. I'd like to be with you a little.
- Fine.

1536
01:58:11,167 --> 01:58:13,251
If you feel up to it, May,

1537
01:58:14,837 --> 01:58:18,298
there is something
that I've been wanting to talk to you about.

1538
01:58:18,382 --> 01:58:21,593
And I tried to talk to you the other evening.

1539
01:58:22,470 --> 01:58:24,096
Yes, dear. Something about yourself.

1540
01:58:24,180 --> 01:58:25,847
About myself, yes.

1541
01:58:27,350 --> 01:58:30,936
It's so difficult to find the right words.

1542
01:58:31,020 --> 01:58:35,440
But it's just that
I feel so terribly tired at the moment.

1543
01:58:37,610 --> 01:58:39,111
And I think...

1544
01:58:40,196 --> 01:58:42,197
Each day a little more so.

1545
01:58:43,741 --> 01:58:48,036
And I think it would be better for everyone
if I were to make a break.

1546
01:58:49,872 --> 01:58:51,915
You mean give up the law?

1547
01:58:55,336 --> 01:58:59,965
Well, certainly that would be a part of it.
And also just to...

1548
01:59:00,049 --> 01:59:01,299
Just to get away.

1549
01:59:01,384 --> 01:59:03,802
I... I'd like to do some travelling.

1550
01:59:08,558 --> 01:59:10,058
To Europe or...

1551
01:59:11,811 --> 01:59:13,603
Perhaps even farther.

1552
01:59:16,023 --> 01:59:17,232
How far?

1553
01:59:18,234 --> 01:59:20,277
I don't know. I thought...

1554
01:59:21,320 --> 01:59:22,988
India or Japan.

1555
01:59:26,951 --> 01:59:28,493
As far as that?

1556
01:59:34,417 --> 01:59:35,625
Well...

1557
01:59:39,797 --> 01:59:41,923
I'm afraid you can't, dear.

1558
01:59:44,051 --> 01:59:46,386
Not unless you take me with you.

1559
01:59:50,141 --> 01:59:54,227
That is, if the doctors will let me go,
and I'm afraid they won't.

1560
01:59:58,024 --> 02:00:02,569
Newland, I've been sure of something
since this morning,

1561
02:00:02,653 --> 02:00:05,113
and I've been longing to tell you.

1562
02:00:20,379 --> 02:00:21,796
Oh, my dear.

1563
02:00:21,881 --> 02:00:23,506
You didn't guess?

1564
02:00:25,092 --> 02:00:28,762
No. I mean, of course, I... I hoped, but...

1565
02:00:39,607 --> 02:00:41,650
Have you told anyone else?

1566
02:00:43,653 --> 02:00:46,655
Only Mamma and your mother...

1567
02:00:46,739 --> 02:00:48,073
And Ellen.

1568
02:00:51,619 --> 02:00:56,206
I told you we had a long talk one afternoon
and how wonderful she was to me.

1569
02:01:04,882 --> 02:01:07,509
Did you mind my telling her, Newland?

1570
02:01:08,928 --> 02:01:11,054
Mind? Why should I?

1571
02:01:11,138 --> 02:01:13,807
But that was two weeks ago, wasn't it?

1572
02:01:16,102 --> 02:01:19,396
I thought you just said
you weren't sure till today?

1573
02:01:21,274 --> 02:01:24,234
No, I... I wasn't sure then,

1574
02:01:24,318 --> 02:01:26,736
but I told her I was.

1575
02:01:30,533 --> 02:01:34,202
And you see, I was right.

1576
02:01:52,638 --> 02:01:54,973
It was the room

1577
02:01:55,057 --> 02:01:59,728
in which most of the reaI things
of his life had happened.

1578
02:02:09,447 --> 02:02:11,573
Their eldest boy, Theodore,

1579
02:02:11,657 --> 02:02:15,160
too delicate to be taken to church
in midwinter,

1580
02:02:15,244 --> 02:02:17,162
had been christened there.

1581
02:02:17,246 --> 02:02:21,583
I baptise thee in the name of the Father,

1582
02:02:21,667 --> 02:02:23,668
and of the son,

1583
02:02:23,753 --> 02:02:25,545
and of the holy spirit.

1584
02:02:35,806 --> 02:02:38,641
It was here that Ted took his first steps.

1585
02:02:40,144 --> 02:02:43,563
And it was here that Archer
and his wife always discussed

1586
02:02:43,647 --> 02:02:46,107
the future of all their children.

1587
02:02:46,650 --> 02:02:49,277
Bill's interest in archaeology,

1588
02:02:49,362 --> 02:02:53,281
Mary's passion for sports and philanthropy,

1589
02:02:53,366 --> 02:02:58,495
Ted's inclination toward art
that led to a job with an architect,

1590
02:02:58,579 --> 02:03:01,456
as well as some considerable redecoration.

1591
02:03:03,793 --> 02:03:07,379
It was in this room
that Mary had announced her engagement...

1592
02:03:07,463 --> 02:03:09,214
I'm so happy for you.

1593
02:03:09,298 --> 02:03:13,968
To the dullest and most reliable
of Larry Lefferts' many sons.

1594
02:03:21,644 --> 02:03:24,813
And it was in this room, too,
that her father had kissed her

1595
02:03:24,897 --> 02:03:29,025
through her wedding veiI
before they motored to Grace Church.

1596
02:03:38,035 --> 02:03:41,746
He was a dutifuI and loving father,
and a faithful husband.

1597
02:03:43,499 --> 02:03:48,336
When May died of infectious pneumonia
after nursing Bill safely through,

1598
02:03:48,421 --> 02:03:50,880
he had honestly mourned her.

1599
02:03:50,965 --> 02:03:53,550
The world of her youth had fallen into pieces

1600
02:03:53,634 --> 02:03:57,512
and rebuilt itself without her ever noticing.

1601
02:03:58,097 --> 02:04:01,266
This hard, bright blindness,

1602
02:04:01,350 --> 02:04:04,436
her incapacity to recognise change,

1603
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:09,107
made her children conceal their views
from her, just as Archer concealed his.

1604
02:04:10,609 --> 02:04:14,112
She died thinking the world a good place,

1605
02:04:14,196 --> 02:04:17,740
full of loving
and harmonious households like her own.

1606
02:04:19,326 --> 02:04:22,662
Newland Archer, in his 57th year,

1607
02:04:22,746 --> 02:04:25,582
mourned his past and honoured it.

1608
02:04:29,587 --> 02:04:31,713
Yes, hello? Hello?

1609
02:04:31,797 --> 02:04:33,465
Chicago wants you.

1610
02:04:33,549 --> 02:04:34,799
Hello?

1611
02:04:34,884 --> 02:04:36,676
- Dad?
- Is that you, Ted?

1612
02:04:36,760 --> 02:04:38,470
Dad, I'm just about finished out here,

1613
02:04:38,554 --> 02:04:41,473
but my client wants me to look
at some gardens before I start designing.

1614
02:04:41,557 --> 02:04:42,974
That sounds fine. Where?

1615
02:04:43,058 --> 02:04:44,684
- Europe.
- Gracious.

1616
02:04:44,768 --> 02:04:47,604
I'll have to saiI next Wednesday
on the Mauretania.

1617
02:04:47,688 --> 02:04:49,939
What, and miss the wedding?

1618
02:04:50,024 --> 02:04:51,316
I think Annie will wait for me.

1619
02:04:51,400 --> 02:04:53,735
I'll be back on the 1st,
and our wedding's not till the 5th.

1620
02:04:53,819 --> 02:04:55,445
I'm surprised you remember the date.

1621
02:04:55,529 --> 02:04:59,240
- Well... Dad, I was hoping you'd join me.
- What?

1622
02:04:59,325 --> 02:05:01,826
I'll need you to remind me
of what's important.

1623
02:05:01,911 --> 02:05:04,287
What do you say?
It will be our last father-and-son trip.

1624
02:05:04,371 --> 02:05:06,831
- Well, Ted, I do appreciate the invitation...
- Wonderful!

1625
02:05:06,916 --> 02:05:08,875
Can you call the Cunard office
first thing tomorrow?

1626
02:05:08,959 --> 02:05:11,628
But it would take me
till next Wednesday just to cancel my...

1627
02:05:11,712 --> 02:05:15,215
I won't hear it, Dad. The Atlantic is calling us.

1628
02:05:15,299 --> 02:05:17,675
I'll be in New York on Monday,
and I'll contact you then.

1629
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:19,385
- You'll be in New...
- On Monday.

1630
02:05:19,470 --> 02:05:20,678
I'll see what I can do.

1631
02:05:20,763 --> 02:05:21,930
Settle the tickets, Dad.

1632
02:05:22,014 --> 02:05:25,308
I can't promise anything, Ted.
I'll see what I can do. All right.

1633
02:05:25,392 --> 02:05:26,643
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

1634
02:05:45,496 --> 02:05:48,414
I'm going out to Versailles with Tourneur.
Will you join us?

1635
02:05:48,499 --> 02:05:51,209
I thought I'd go to the Louvre.

1636
02:05:51,293 --> 02:05:53,002
I'll meet you there later then.

1637
02:05:53,087 --> 02:05:55,880
Countess Olenska's expecting us at 5:30.

1638
02:05:56,507 --> 02:05:58,299
What?

1639
02:05:58,384 --> 02:05:59,509
Didn't I tell you?

1640
02:06:00,302 --> 02:06:03,388
Annie made me swear
to do three things in Paris.

1641
02:06:03,472 --> 02:06:05,848
Get her the score of the last Debussy songs,

1642
02:06:05,933 --> 02:06:09,394
go to the Grand Guignol,
and see Madame Olenska.

1643
02:06:09,478 --> 02:06:10,645
You know, she was awfully good to Annie

1644
02:06:10,729 --> 02:06:13,565
when Mr Beaufort sent her over
to the Sorbonne.

1645
02:06:13,649 --> 02:06:16,568
Wasn't the Countess friendly
with Mr Beaufort's first wife or something?

1646
02:06:16,652 --> 02:06:19,320
I think Mrs Beaufort said that she was.

1647
02:06:19,405 --> 02:06:22,490
In any case, I called the Countess
first thing this morning,

1648
02:06:22,575 --> 02:06:24,784
introduced myself as her cousin.

1649
02:06:24,868 --> 02:06:27,412
Did you tell her I was here, Ted?

1650
02:06:27,496 --> 02:06:30,290
Of course. Why not?

1651
02:06:30,374 --> 02:06:32,792
She sounds lovely. Was she?

1652
02:06:37,214 --> 02:06:38,423
Lovely?

1653
02:06:41,510 --> 02:06:44,220
I don't know. She was different.

1654
02:06:57,693 --> 02:07:00,987
Whenever he thought of Ellen Olenska,

1655
02:07:01,071 --> 02:07:04,073
it had been abstractly, serenely,

1656
02:07:04,158 --> 02:07:07,535
like an imaginary loved one
in a book or picture.

1657
02:07:12,374 --> 02:07:16,169
She had become the complete vision
of all that he had missed.

1658
02:07:21,133 --> 02:07:23,009
I'm only 57.

1659
02:07:28,515 --> 02:07:30,516
Did Mr Beaufort
really have such a bad time of it

1660
02:07:30,601 --> 02:07:32,185
when he wanted to remarry?

1661
02:07:32,269 --> 02:07:34,437
No one wanted to give him an inch?

1662
02:07:34,521 --> 02:07:37,398
Perhaps because
he'd already taken so much.

1663
02:07:38,651 --> 02:07:41,569
As if anyone remembers any more, or cares.

1664
02:07:42,738 --> 02:07:47,158
Well, Annie Ring and he
did have a lovely daughter. You're very lucky.

1665
02:07:48,077 --> 02:07:50,244
We're very lucky, you mean.

1666
02:07:50,788 --> 02:07:52,997
Yes, of course that's what I mean.

1667
02:07:53,082 --> 02:07:56,668
So considering how that all turned out,
and all the time that's gone by,

1668
02:07:56,752 --> 02:07:59,003
I don't see how you can resist.

1669
02:07:59,088 --> 02:08:02,340
I did have some resistance
at first to your marriage, as I told you...

1670
02:08:02,424 --> 02:08:06,803
No. I mean resist seeing the woman
you almost threw everything over for.

1671
02:08:07,971 --> 02:08:09,639
Only you didn't.

1672
02:08:10,474 --> 02:08:11,766
I didn't?

1673
02:08:12,935 --> 02:08:14,102
No.

1674
02:08:15,270 --> 02:08:16,521
But Mother said that she knew

1675
02:08:16,605 --> 02:08:19,232
- we would be safe with you.
- Your mother?

1676
02:08:19,316 --> 02:08:23,319
Yes. The day before she died
she asked to see me alone. Remember?

1677
02:08:24,738 --> 02:08:26,948
She said she knew we were safe with you,

1678
02:08:27,032 --> 02:08:29,117
and always would be,

1679
02:08:29,201 --> 02:08:32,286
because once, when she asked you to,

1680
02:08:33,539 --> 02:08:36,374
you gave up the thing that you wanted most.

1681
02:08:49,138 --> 02:08:50,722
She never asked.

1682
02:08:53,892 --> 02:08:55,810
She never asked me.

1683
02:09:03,318 --> 02:09:07,321
After a little while
he did not regret Ted's indiscretion.

1684
02:09:08,365 --> 02:09:12,160
It seemed to take an iron band
from his heart to know that,

1685
02:09:12,244 --> 02:09:16,164
after all, someone had guessed and pitied,

1686
02:09:17,040 --> 02:09:22,003
and that it should have been his wife
moved him inexpressibly.

1687
02:09:40,606 --> 02:09:43,191
The porter says it's the third floor.

1688
02:09:45,527 --> 02:09:47,945
Must be the one with the awnings.

1689
02:09:50,908 --> 02:09:52,533
It's nearly 6:00.

1690
02:09:55,037 --> 02:09:57,497
I think I'll just sit for a while.

1691
02:10:00,834 --> 02:10:02,919
Do you mean you won't come?

1692
02:10:05,714 --> 02:10:08,633
- You really won't come at all?
- I don't know.

1693
02:10:10,636 --> 02:10:12,428
She won't understand.

1694
02:10:13,806 --> 02:10:16,224
Go on, Ted. Maybe I'll follow you.

1695
02:10:20,312 --> 02:10:21,562
What will I tell her?

1696
02:10:22,731 --> 02:10:25,399
Don't you always have something to say?

1697
02:10:28,570 --> 02:10:30,112
I'll tell her you're old-fashioned,

1698
02:10:30,197 --> 02:10:34,700
and you insist on walking up three flights
instead of taking the elevator.

1699
02:10:42,709 --> 02:10:44,836
Just say I'm old-fashioned.

1700
02:10:46,088 --> 02:10:48,589
