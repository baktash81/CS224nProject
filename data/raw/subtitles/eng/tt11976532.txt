- Right.

- where I met her.
- Okay.

60
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:22,913
But it's a question mark
with an exclamation point,

61
00:03:22,937 --> 00:03:24,672
which means I should
want to follow up.

62

<i>-Let's see what the options are first though.
-Yes.</i>

Exactly that. That's the
world that we're living in.

64
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:31,445
You can just see what the
options are for anything.

65

You want to see all the flights.

68
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:36,751
- That's a good thing.
- Yeah.

69

It's easier just to find the
most supportive person here.

- Right.

76

00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,332
The best advice here.

78
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,935
The second-best sex here.

79
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:55,402
Hundred percent.

80
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,771
JOHN: <i>I don't ever
want to go past</i>

81

parents do for a living.</i>

parents do for a living...

83
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,809
- Right. Right.
- I've hung too long.

84
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:03,754
<i>Or, like, siblings. Like,
why does anyone want to know</i>

85
00:04:03,778 --> 00:04:05,580
about your siblings?
Especially so early.

86
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:07,481
-Yeah.
-"How many siblings do you have?"

87
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:09,059
Has that ever changed whether
you want to date somebody?

88
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,761
It's like, "I have two
sisters and a brother."

89
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:12,419
- Whoa. Hold on.
- Well, I'm out of here.

90
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:13,764
- I'm out of here.
- You know what I just say?

91
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:15,499
I only date only children
or the oldest of three.

92
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:16,633
JOHN: <i>They say,
"Exercise your options."</i>

It's like a muscle.

94
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:19,627
- Options are like a muscle.
- Yeah.

95
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,796
Some people are
weak and atrophied,

96
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,064
and they don't understand

97
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:24,766

101
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,908
No. We're afraid of commitment

102
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,442
to something we
can't get out of.

103
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,054
There's no such thing
as fear of commitment.

104
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:39,479
Fear of commitment
is fear of regret.

105
00:04:39,514 --> 00:04:41,448
JOHN: <i>Hundred percent.
Or fear of intimacy.</i>

106

deeper with somebody,

00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:50,925
if that would somehow
be more meaningful?

110
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,927
I do sometimes.

111
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,361
Like right now, I'm
casually dating,

112
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,797
like, six or seven
different women.

113
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,965
But I do wonder, deep
down, what it would be like

114
00:04:57,999 --> 00:05:00,668
to seriously date two or three.

115
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:02,770
Even when I don't
understand you,

116
00:05:02,804 --> 00:05:04,939
I understand you better
than I understand anybody.

This is like, if someone
were recording this,

that's what my
podcast should be.

120
00:05:10,912 --> 00:05:13,014
There should be, like, the
sound of a stand-up bass

playing under me right now.

122

"Random House," the publisher?

137
00:05:40,575 --> 00:05:42,510
America.

138

(laughing) Okay.

139
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:44,846
I know you're laughing,

140
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,056
but I have a pitch
you're really gonna like.

141
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,582
America is divided,

142
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:49,817
but it's not for the
reason that we think.

143
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:52,520
We think that America's
divided by geography:

144
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:55,723
red state, blue
state, city, country.

145
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:58,092
We're missing something
far more profound.

146
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,994
America isn't divided by space.

147
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,863
America is divided by time.

148
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:03,764
-We don't live in the moment anymore.
-Mm.

149
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:05,867
And why would we, when
we can live in any moment

150
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,400
that's ever been recorded?

151
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:09,537
And when we experience
something we really love,

152
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,738
our overwhelming instinct

153
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:12,149
is to somehow file
it away for later.

154
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:13,608
That's interesting.

155
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:15,543
We don't watch movies
in the theater.

156
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:16,911
We don't watch TV when it airs.

157
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:20,748
We don't even have
conversations at the same time

158
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:21,549
because we text.

159
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:23,751
And when you text,
I can say, "Hi,"

160
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,620
and you could say
"Hi" back in a second,

161
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:27,822
- or a minute.
- Or never.

162
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:30,024
Or never 'cause it's you

163
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,169
and you're too busy producing
the biggest podcast in America,

164
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:34,137
which is kind of my point
because we're all living

165
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:36,564
in our own individualized times.

166
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:39,634
That's why we're living
in divided times.

167
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:40,677
That's... I like that. Ooh.

168
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:42,503
- You like that?
- Yeah.

169
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,538
So, what do you think? Do
you think that's a story?

170
00:06:45,907 --> 00:06:47,508
It's a theory.

171
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,052
- A theory is a story.
- No, a theory is not a story.

172
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,187
Yes, it is when
it's about an idea.

173
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:51,946
And America is an idea.

174
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:53,581
That's what makes it so great.

175
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:55,750
- So, if you're...
- No, America is its people.

176
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:58,552
That's what makes
it so fucked up.

177
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:01,522
Hey. Not every white
guy in New York

178
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:02,966
- needs to have a podcast.
- (chuckling)

179
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,558
You have the
verified check mark.

180
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:06,227
You got the <i>New Yorker</i> position.

181
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,561
I want something more.

182
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:09,530
I don't just want
to be a writer.

183
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,666
I... I want to be a voice.

184
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:14,702
As dorky as it sounds,
I care about America.

185
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:16,671
And not in that faded
Lana Del Rey way.

186
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:17,944
And now I see it falling apart,

187
00:07:17,972 --> 00:07:19,607
and we're just
standing in the corner,

188
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,809
like, making fun
of it, you know?

189
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:25,947
I'd like to try to tell
some story that... connects.

190
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,216
Okay, okay. Well, then...
let me help you connect.

191
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,218
With all your ideas
about America...

192
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:33,054
Even if they're good, right?

193
00:07:33,087 --> 00:07:34,555
You gotta put 'em in a story

194
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:37,058
'cause Americans
listen to stories.

195
00:07:37,091 --> 00:07:38,491
'Cause Americans are people.

196
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:41,494
They're not... ideas.

197
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:43,864
- You're-you're here.
- Yeah.

198
00:07:43,898 --> 00:07:45,700
You need to be here.

199
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:48,069
Does that make sense?

200
00:07:48,102 --> 00:07:50,004
Hundred percent.

201
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,507
(through earphones):
I'm Robin Dillon,

202
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:54,976
and this is <i>American Moment.</i>

203
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:58,512

Western Montana fly-fishing...

- Hi.
- Hey.

209
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,602
You changed your hair.

210
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:23,137
- Yeah, you noticed.
- Of course.

211
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,739
How's the book world?

212
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:26,007
The what?

213
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,975
Uh, nothing. Uh, can
I get you a drink?

214
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:29,110
- Yes.
- Great.

215
00:08:29,143 --> 00:08:30,745
Um, what can I make you?

216
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:33,014
Um, can you do,
like, a white wine?

217
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:34,248
Um, sure.

218
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:35,683
I have to open a
bottle for that.

219
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:37,018
Oh, that's okay. Open it.

220
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:39,286
I only want, like, one glass.

221
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,722

- Hello?
- MAN: Ben?

(man sniffling over phone)

227
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:09,283
Yeah. Hello?

228
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:10,918
This is the worst phone call

229
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:13,621
you're ever gonna
get in your life.

230
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:16,023
(crying): Oh, my God.

231
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:19,760
Your girlfriend's dead.

232
00:09:19,794 --> 00:09:23,164
I'm sorry. Wh...
What did you say?

233
00:09:23,197 --> 00:09:24,665
She's dead.

234
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:26,300
No, no, the first part.

235
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,935

00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:28,803
Yeah, I'm sorry.

Hey, I don't... I
don't understand.

238
00:09:31,105 --> 00:09:32,740
I know. I know, I know.

239
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,842
We can't make no
sense of it either.

240

Who is this?

241
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,080
This is Ty Shaw.

242
00:09:39,113 --> 00:09:40,681
Abby's brother.

243
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:43,818
Um, hey, I don't... I don't
really know what to say.

244
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:46,320
Oh, I know, I know this
must be so hard to process.

245
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:48,122
I'm so sorry.

246
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:49,890
Abby told us so much about you.

247
00:09:49,924 --> 00:09:51,759
Abby.

248
00:09:52,393 --> 00:09:55,663
Oh, my God.

249
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:57,098
- Abby.
- (Ty crying)

250
00:09:57,131 --> 00:09:59,200
- Who's Abby?
- (gasps)

251
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:00,367
Uh, some girl. Um...

252
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:03,204
- TY: Who's that?
- Uh, some...

253
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:06,140
We definitely hung
out a few times.

254
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:08,109
I-I wouldn't have...

255
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:09,343
Funeral's Sunday.

Oh, my God. I'm, uh...

257
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:12,913
Can you tell me where
I can send flowers?

258
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:15,416
(chuckles): Oh, there's no
need to send flowers, Ben.

259
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:16,851
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

260
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:18,285
I'm absolutely
gonna send flowers.

261
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:19,720
Just, uh, you tell
me the address.

262
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:21,255
See if you can text it to me.

263
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,200
If you really want, there's
a flower shop by the airport.

264
00:10:23,224 --> 00:10:26,127
We'll just swing by
there when I pick you up.

265
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,062
When you pick me up?

266
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:31,198
Uh, hey.

267
00:10:31,232 --> 00:10:32,867
I will be there in spirit.

268
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,668
Spirit Airlines. Right, man.

269
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:35,870
That's a great choice.

270
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,404
You just let me
know what flight.

271
00:10:37,438 --> 00:10:40,774
Uh, hey, uh, I...

272
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:42,309
This is just...

273
00:10:42,343 --> 00:10:43,444
I can't do this.

274
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:45,212
None of us can do this.

275
00:10:45,246 --> 00:10:46,680
Not alone.

Y'all had your whole
future ahead of you.

278
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,119
- Okay.

279
00:10:52,153 --> 00:10:53,354
Okay, don't cry.

00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:56,891
I mean, no, cry. Cry.

282
00:10:56,924 --> 00:10:58,459
- Um, of course.
- Oh, God.

283
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,127
Be in touch with
your emotions. Um...

284
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:02,863
I can't believe we have
to go through this.

285
00:11:02,897 --> 00:11:05,299
Okay. All right. Um, hey.

286
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,301
Remind me where you
guys are exactly.

Okay, are you near Austin?

No, we're not near Austin.

- Dallas?
- Dallas ain't Texas.

294
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,956
- Houston?
- Houston's another country.

00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:30,925
Why don't you just
tell me where...

296

Have you heard of
Abilene? The city.

297
00:11:33,528 --> 00:11:35,930
Never heard of Abilene, no.

298
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:38,933
Well, Abilene is about
three hours from Dallas.

299
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:39,767
Okay.

00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,288
Yes.

349
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:20,060
She loved music.

350
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:24,231
I know that. I know that.

351
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:25,999
She loved music.

352
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,202
- Yeah.
- (guests crying)

353
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:33,941
And...

354
00:14:35,677 --> 00:14:38,613
she will always be a
song in our hearts.

355
00:14:38,646 --> 00:14:40,247
(guests exclaim quietly)

356
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:45,452
(quiet murmuring)

357
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:51,024
("That's Why We Ride" by Casey
Donahew plays over radio)

358
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:52,527
(Ty sighs heavily)

359
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,994
"Song in our hearts."

360
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:56,598
Phew. You damn near
broke me with that one.

361
00:14:56,631 --> 00:14:58,432
♪ It's those
eight-second chances ♪

362
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,267
♪ And cowgirl glances ♪

363
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,672

baby, that's why we ride... ♪

364
00:15:04,706 --> 00:15:07,274

365
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,143
Now, I don't know
about you, but...

366
00:15:09,176 --> 00:15:11,087
I know it hasn't been long,
but I feel like me and you,

367
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:13,280
we got a real bond.

368
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:14,549
Kind of like family.

369
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:16,417
Hundred percent.

370
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,486
Wow.

371
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:21,288
A hundred percent?

372
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:23,223
Yeah.

373
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:25,560
Yeah. I felt really
close to you guys today.

374
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:28,128
Don't just say that to say it.

375
00:15:28,763 --> 00:15:31,198
- Yeah.
- I knew it.

376
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:37,337
(turns off engine)

377
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:41,308
Abilene just didn't die.

378
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:43,143
She was murdered.

379
00:15:43,177 --> 00:15:46,079
And the two of us are
gonna avenge her death.

380
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:48,750
What?

381
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:51,586
You and me, we're gonna
track her killer down

382
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:53,454
and deliver vengeance.

383
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:58,025
Okay, nobody said
anything about a killer.

384
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:00,528
An overdose? (scoffs)

385
00:16:00,562 --> 00:16:02,229
At a party in an oil field?

386
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:05,065
Yeah. The girl never took so
much as an Advil in her life.

387
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:07,502
You know that. You know
her better than anybody.

388
00:16:09,203 --> 00:16:10,705
Did you call the
police about this?

389
00:16:10,738 --> 00:16:14,107
In Texas, we don't dial 911.

390
00:16:14,776 --> 00:16:16,109
Not even for, like, a fire?

391
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,712
Fire or ambulance, fine.

392
00:16:17,745 --> 00:16:19,681
Who do you think did it?

393
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:21,181
I got a couple theories.

394
00:16:21,215 --> 00:16:24,218
Cartels. Mexican gangbanger
I got my eyes on.

395
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:25,787
I mean, this is
just the beginning.

396
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,154
It goes deep.

397
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:29,524
And what's this based on?

398
00:16:29,557 --> 00:16:30,692
Gut.

399
00:16:30,725 --> 00:16:33,360
Right. What's
behind that though?

400
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,630
Ain't nothing behind gut.

401
00:16:35,663 --> 00:16:38,232
Gut's behind everything
else. Otherwise, who are you?

402
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:40,200
I really think this is
something for the police.

403
00:16:40,234 --> 00:16:42,269
Yeah. You talk about the police

404
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:44,171
like it's just the
same everywhere.

405
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:47,107
Like the police
is, um, McDonald's

406
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,810
and justice is an Egg McMuffin.

407
00:16:48,843 --> 00:16:50,612
We don't have the police.

408
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:52,379
We got Mike and Dan.

409
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,085
You and me, we were
the men in her life.

410
00:16:58,786 --> 00:17:01,255
And they fucked with
the wrong two guys.

411
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:04,458
Okay. Um...

412
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:08,530
So, as, like, a
personal boundary,

413
00:17:08,563 --> 00:17:10,130
like, everybody's different.

414
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:11,666
Some people don't
eat certain foods.

415
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,234
You know, everybody...

416
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:17,437
- I don't avenge deaths.
- Mm-hmm.

417
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:19,406
It's just who I am.

418
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,644
I... You know, I don't live
in a Liam Neeson movie.

419
00:17:23,645 --> 00:17:26,280
But you kind of look like a guy
from a Liam Neeson movie though.

420
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:27,549
Okay.

421
00:17:27,582 --> 00:17:29,216
Which one am I thinking about?

422
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:30,718
It-it was a train.
No, i-it was...

423
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:32,152
- It was just on TV.
- I don't know.

424
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:34,187
<i>Schindler's List.</i> Oh, my God.

425
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:37,291
You look like a lot of
those guys in that movie.

426
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:39,527
(quietly): Yeah. Thanks.

427
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:42,095
You know, that was my least
favorite Liam Neeson movie.

428
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:43,665
Huge downer.

429
00:17:43,698 --> 00:17:45,465
It was a really sad movie.

430
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:47,669
Ty, I know that you're
in a lot of pain.

431
00:17:47,702 --> 00:17:49,169
Oh, yes, sir. We both are.

432
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:50,572
And you have a lot of anger.

433
00:17:50,605 --> 00:17:53,541
Goddamn it, I'm asking
you for your help.

434
00:17:53,575 --> 00:17:56,443
If we don't do this, it's
like leaving her body

435
00:17:56,476 --> 00:18:00,080
out in the middle of that desert
for the rest of our lives.

436
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:04,184
I know it the minute I saw you.

437
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:07,254
'Cause heart sees heart.

438
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:11,224
Stay down here and avenge
Abby's death with me.

439
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,630
Oh, what a story that would be.

440
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:21,234
(ringtone playing)

441
00:18:24,672 --> 00:18:26,239
Is this a pocket dial?

442
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:27,341
BEN: I have a story.

443
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:28,743
- Can it wait?
- No.

444
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:30,654
I'm in Texas. I'm on my
way back from a funeral.

445
00:18:30,678 --> 00:18:32,312
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

446
00:18:32,346 --> 00:18:35,115
It's okay. It's not
someone I was close to.

447
00:18:35,717 --> 00:18:37,719
But you flew to Texas for it?

448
00:18:37,752 --> 00:18:39,353
Uh, yes.

449
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:41,689
Uh, it was a girl I hooked
up with a few times.

450
00:18:41,723 --> 00:18:43,390
You flew to Texas

451
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:45,727
to attend the funeral
of a random hookup?

452
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,630
Her family thought that we
were more serious than I did.

453
00:18:48,663 --> 00:18:49,797
Do you know what?

454
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:51,498
This is a story.

455
00:18:51,532 --> 00:18:53,467
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

456
00:18:53,501 --> 00:18:54,301
It's you.

457
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,336
The-the... Your
whole way of life.

458
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,372
It's dating, it's
hookup culture.

459
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:00,742
How it enables disconnectedness.

460
00:19:00,775 --> 00:19:02,644
- The selfishness.
- No.

461
00:19:02,677 --> 00:19:03,911
- The emptiness.
- No.

462
00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:04,912
- The hollowness.
- That's not what I meant.

463
00:19:04,946 --> 00:19:06,279
The lack of self-awareness.

464
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:07,491
Okay, that's not
what I'm pitching.

465
00:19:07,515 --> 00:19:08,726
It's really how
sad your life is.

466
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,960
Okay, now you're
fucking with me.

467
00:19:09,984 --> 00:19:12,920
Listen, I'm in West Texas

468
00:19:12,954 --> 00:19:14,565
where this family just
lost their daughter

469
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:15,690
to an opioid overdose.

470
00:19:15,723 --> 00:19:17,525
That is sad but common.

471
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:21,261
Except, her brother won't
accept it's an overdose.

472
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:22,530
He says it was a murder.

473
00:19:22,563 --> 00:19:23,865
Based on what?

474
00:19:23,898 --> 00:19:25,566
Nothing.

475
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,934
And that's the story.

476
00:19:26,968 --> 00:19:29,302
This is an existential
crime story.

477
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:32,339
This is <i>In Cold Blood,</i>
but there are no killers.

478
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:34,341
This is about a new
American reality

479
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:35,810
that people can't accept.

480
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:38,680
So instead, they invent
these myths and conspiracies

481
00:19:38,713 --> 00:19:42,684
so they can cast themselves
as heroes because...

482
00:19:42,717 --> 00:19:44,952
the truth is too hard to accept.

483
00:19:44,986 --> 00:19:48,956
The death of Abilene is about
the death of American identity

484
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,534
and the need to find
someone to blame for it.

485
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:54,461
This isn't just a
story about vengeance.

486
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:57,330
It's a story about the
need for vengeance.

487
00:19:57,364 --> 00:20:01,602
The meaning of vengeance.

488
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:06,808
Dead white girl?

489
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:08,710
Holy grail of podcasts.

490
00:20:08,743 --> 00:20:12,479
Eloise, I wish my
recorder were already on.

491
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:13,957
He's saying such
crazy things already.

492
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:16,249
ELOISE: Her brother?

493
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,486
He is such a character.

494
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,421
And you can get
close to the family?

495
00:20:21,455 --> 00:20:23,490
Can I get close to the family?

496
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:25,727
They think I was her boyfriend.

497
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,428
I mean...

498
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:31,666
I went to her funeral,
for God's sake.

499
00:20:31,699 --> 00:20:32,900
ELOISE: That's good.

500
00:20:32,934 --> 00:20:34,836
I mean, it's fucked up, but...

501
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:36,571
but it's good for this.

502
00:20:36,604 --> 00:20:38,506
So?

503
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:41,709
Okay, let's give it a shot.

504
00:20:42,643 --> 00:20:44,645
Oh!

505
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:45,989
Okay, talk to me.
Give me everything.

506
00:20:46,013 --> 00:20:47,447
Stay with the family,

507
00:20:47,481 --> 00:20:49,550
get as close as possible,
record everything.

508
00:20:49,584 --> 00:20:51,327
'Cause you never know
what will be important.

509
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:53,487
I'll be your editor,
so I'll pull selects

510
00:20:53,521 --> 00:20:54,822
- and see what's there.
- Okay.

511
00:20:54,856 --> 00:20:56,691
I'll have Tracy overnight
you the equipment,

512
00:20:56,724 --> 00:20:58,893
but just use your
phone in the meantime

513
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:00,995
and get the story, stay safe.

514
00:21:01,028 --> 00:21:02,429
You got it.

515
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:04,297
- Not in that order.
- In that order.

516
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:05,733
(phone beeps)

517
00:21:10,772 --> 00:21:12,540
(clears throat)

518
00:21:13,508 --> 00:21:18,378
The dust in West Texas
settles like rain on a lake.

519
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:21,716
I'm under a West Texas
sky, bright blue Texan sky,

520
00:21:21,749 --> 00:21:26,053
where I've just learned about
the death of Abilene Shaw.

521
00:21:26,087 --> 00:21:28,689
My...

522
00:21:28,723 --> 00:21:30,758
A person...

523
00:21:31,893 --> 00:21:33,861
who lived here.

yeah, brother.

All right.

526
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:49,409
I'm gonna stay with you
guys for a couple of weeks.

527
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:50,978
I'm gonna record everything

528
00:21:51,012 --> 00:21:52,547
that you think
happened to Abilene.

529
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,582
- Okay?
- Hell yes. Then we kill him.

530
00:21:54,615 --> 00:21:55,550
No.

531
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:58,451
I'm gonna put it on a podcast...

532
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:04,959
and it will be on
podcast platforms.

533
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:06,894
That's fucking brilliant.

534
00:22:06,928 --> 00:22:08,996
- Yeah.
- You're fucking smart.

535
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,463
All right.

536

538
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,802

Uh, no.

-Hi.

She's gonna be a
famous filmmaker.

Those are not our values.

You have to be a

celebrity.

573
00:23:39,954 --> 00:23:41,164
These are really your daughters?

574
00:23:41,188 --> 00:23:43,190
I mean, you all
could be sisters.

You are so sweet.

Oh. It's okay, Ben.

He don't speak Spanish.

00:24:15,256 --> 00:24:16,691
You have a lovely

589
00:24:16,724 --> 00:24:18,268
- TY: Thank you.
- BEN: It's really nice.

590
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:19,569
- This is Granny Carole.
- BEN: Yeah.

591
00:24:19,593 --> 00:24:20,761
Granny for short.

592
00:24:20,795 --> 00:24:23,164
- Um, nice to meet you, Granny.
- Yeah.

593
00:24:23,197 --> 00:24:25,700
Thank you. Um...

594
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:28,202
So, Ben, tell us about yourself.

595
00:24:28,235 --> 00:24:30,071
Do you come from a close family?

596
00:24:30,104 --> 00:24:31,973
Yes. Um, we're very close.

597
00:24:32,006 --> 00:24:35,475
We don't see each other
much, but we're very close.

598
00:24:36,177 --> 00:24:38,179
GRANNY: You from Texas?

599
00:24:38,212 --> 00:24:40,147
Oh. No, I'm not.

600
00:24:40,181 --> 00:24:41,248
Oh, I'm sorry.

601
00:24:41,282 --> 00:24:42,950
That you're not from Texas.

602
00:24:42,984 --> 00:24:44,652
(Ty chuckles)

603
00:24:44,685 --> 00:24:46,663
-Have you been to Texas before, Ben?
-Yes, actually.

604
00:24:46,687 --> 00:24:48,189
I've been to Austin,
uh, for South By.

605
00:24:48,222 --> 00:24:49,790
GRANNY: For what?

606
00:24:49,824 --> 00:24:51,859
Uh, oh, South by Southwest
is an annual festiv...

607
00:24:51,892 --> 00:24:53,227
No, for what band?

608
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,062
You don't just go to South By.

609
00:24:55,096 --> 00:24:57,031
You go see a band, don't you?

610
00:24:58,032 --> 00:24:59,233
Uh, well, true.

611
00:24:59,266 --> 00:25:01,135
I was part of a journalism panel

612
00:25:01,168 --> 00:25:02,703
about the future of new media.

613
00:25:02,737 --> 00:25:04,271
- TY: Amazing.
- That's so cool.

614
00:25:04,305 --> 00:25:05,916
- TY: Mm. -Thank you.
- PARIS: You're welcome.

615
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,875
Um, speaking of.

616
00:25:07,908 --> 00:25:10,277
Would you mind if I
recorded this dinner?

617
00:25:10,311 --> 00:25:11,645
- GRANNY: Oh.
- Record us now?

618
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:12,279
- PARIS: Yeah.
- TY: Hell yeah.

619
00:25:12,313 --> 00:25:13,881
Would we mind?

620
00:25:13,914 --> 00:25:15,192
- I love being recorded.
- BEN: Great. Fantastic.

621
00:25:15,216 --> 00:25:16,293
- Oh, my God.
- (Granny chuckles)

622
00:25:16,317 --> 00:25:17,785
- Hey, smile. Okay?
- Great.

623
00:25:17,818 --> 00:25:19,129
GRANNY: Well, would
you want to hear

624
00:25:19,153 --> 00:25:21,155
the story of Texas?

625
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:23,157
- Absolutely. -Huh?
- Go, Granny.

626
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,859
GRANNY: All right. Right here.

627
00:25:24,892 --> 00:25:26,660
- SHARON: My goodness.
- GRANNY: Mm. Okay.

628
00:25:27,328 --> 00:25:28,662
1836.

629
00:25:28,696 --> 00:25:30,097
Texas is part of Mexico,

630
00:25:30,131 --> 00:25:33,300
made up of settlers and
English-speaking white folk.

631
00:25:33,334 --> 00:25:35,169
And, uh, they didn't
like the government.

632
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:36,737
What else is new?

633
00:25:36,771 --> 00:25:38,315
Them Texans wanted to
do things their own way.

634
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:39,807
What else is new?

635
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,177
So, you take everybody's
two favorite things,

636
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,147
government and Mexicans.

637
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,049
And guess what happens.

638
00:25:48,082 --> 00:25:49,316
- Huh?
- TY: Go on.

639
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,627
- Guess.
- You should... In your words.

640
00:25:50,651 --> 00:25:51,786
All right. All right.

641
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:54,188
Well, Generalissimo Santa Anna

642
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:57,291
brung up 7,000 Mexican soldiers

643
00:25:57,324 --> 00:26:00,361
to fight against
186 Texan rebels

644
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:02,930
at a place called the Alamo.

645
00:26:02,963 --> 00:26:04,765
And the Texans won.

646
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,667
- That's very inspiring.
- (Paris chuckles)

647
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,135
TY (quietly): Say what?

648
00:26:09,837 --> 00:26:11,972
The Texans didn't win, Ben.

649
00:26:12,006 --> 00:26:13,641
BEN: Mm.

650
00:26:13,674 --> 00:26:16,177
They teach math where you from?

651
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,346
186.7,000.

652
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,215
Um...

653
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:23,684
7,000 is more, Ben.

654
00:26:23,717 --> 00:26:26,555
GRANNY: It was a massacre.

655
00:26:27,221 --> 00:26:29,623
It was unspeakable cruelty.

656
00:26:29,657 --> 00:26:31,125
(crying): Unspeakable cruelty.

657
00:26:31,158 --> 00:26:34,295
BEN: I'm sorry. I had no idea
you didn't win the Alamo.

658
00:26:34,328 --> 00:26:36,697
- Um...
- (phone chiming)

659
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,833
I feel like you guys
talk about it a lot.

660
00:26:38,866 --> 00:26:41,268
Who's "Equinox Girl Cute"?

661
00:26:41,302 --> 00:26:42,970
- Um, a friend.
- (phone chimes)

662
00:26:43,003 --> 00:26:45,106
Who's "Paris Review
Party Asian"?

663
00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:46,941
- BEN: Excuse me. Um...
- Very good reading.

664
00:26:46,974 --> 00:26:49,376
Let me, uh... The Wi-Fi
must have just kicked on.

665
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,021
- Who's "Natalie Bumble"?
- (phone chiming)

666
00:26:51,045 --> 00:26:53,380
- BEN: Um, let-let me just...
- Who's "Katie Raya"?

667
00:26:53,414 --> 00:26:54,758
- Let me put that on...
- GRANNY: Raya?

668
00:26:54,782 --> 00:26:56,217
Let me put that
on airplane mode.

669
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,994
GRANNY: I thought Raya was
supposed to be exclusive.

670
00:26:58,018 --> 00:26:59,920
So what do you think
of this place, Ben?

671
00:26:59,954 --> 00:27:01,922
BEN (laughs): I love it.

672
00:27:01,956 --> 00:27:03,891
- Are you joking?
- Are you serious? You love it?

673
00:27:03,924 --> 00:27:05,259
You're from New York City.

674
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:06,837
-KC: Literally nothing happens here.
-PARIS: Yeah.

675
00:27:06,861 --> 00:27:11,132
Well, um... I mean,
it is a little...

676
00:27:11,165 --> 00:27:13,400
- KC: Hmm?
- You know.

677
00:27:13,434 --> 00:27:14,978
-Bleak.
-PARIS: Come on, that's not fair.

678
00:27:15,002 --> 00:27:16,746
- We just got a Target.
- Excuse me? How dare you?

679
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,772
Do you know how fucking
good our football team is?

680
00:27:18,806 --> 00:27:20,817
-This is our town.
-Okay, look, I don't know where to...

681
00:27:20,841 --> 00:27:22,176
where to land here. Um...

682
00:27:22,209 --> 00:27:24,154
TY: Ben, there's probably
something you should know

683
00:27:24,178 --> 00:27:25,746
- about this place.
- Yeah.

684
00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:29,750
This is the most, uh, wretched,

685
00:27:29,783 --> 00:27:32,453
godforsaken stretch of land
on the face of the earth.

686
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:34,088
And I'd never leave.

687
00:27:34,121 --> 00:27:36,090
You know what I mean?

688
00:27:36,123 --> 00:27:38,726
Yeah. That's how I
feel about Twitter.

689
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:40,270
- PARIS: Mm.
- TY: See, Ben's a journalist.

690
00:27:40,294 --> 00:27:42,062
One of the finest there is.

691
00:27:42,096 --> 00:27:43,764
He writes for the
<i>New York Magazine.</i>

692
00:27:43,797 --> 00:27:45,032
BEN: <i>New Yorker.</i> Yep.

693
00:27:45,065 --> 00:27:46,800
And he's gonna help us find out

694
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:49,770
what really happened to Abilene.

695
00:27:49,803 --> 00:27:51,939
I was saying we go out
and settle with a .45,

696
00:27:51,972 --> 00:27:56,110
but Ben gives a whole new
perspective to the situation.

697
00:27:56,143 --> 00:27:59,947
Ty, you can't solve something
like this with a .45.

698
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,116
It's not as simple
as one person.

699
00:28:02,149 --> 00:28:04,318
It's a whole system, son.

700
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:06,187
Tell us what you mean, Granny.

701
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,088
It's the breakdown of
society, is what it is.

702
00:28:08,122 --> 00:28:09,790
It's the breakdown
of the school system,

703
00:28:09,823 --> 00:28:11,025
- the government.
- TY: Mm.

704
00:28:11,058 --> 00:28:13,928
It's the pharmaceutical
companies.

705
00:28:13,961 --> 00:28:16,797
It's the breakdown of the family

706
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,233
and tradition.

707
00:28:20,267 --> 00:28:22,937
Oh, there's a whole lot
of people responsible

708
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,339
- for what happened to Abilene.
- SHARON: That's true.

709
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:26,508
- Yes, ma'am.
- PARIS: Amen.

710
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:28,042
I think that's very wise.

711
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:29,977
You're gonna need a
12-gauge, couple of ARs.

712
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,412
- No. -Yep.
- A Wesson automatic.

713
00:28:31,445 --> 00:28:32,889
- No, no, no.
- And a sidearm for safety.

714
00:28:32,913 --> 00:28:34,481
- Yep. Exactly.
- We're not doing that.

715
00:28:34,516 --> 00:28:36,917
GRANNY: Oh, we're not? Yeah.

716

I didn't think
you had the balls.

(Ben clears throat)

720
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,802
There's some things I'm good at.

721
00:28:54,835 --> 00:28:57,104
I'm good at asking
the right questions.

722
00:28:57,137 --> 00:28:59,240
I'm good at getting
people to talk.

723
00:28:59,273 --> 00:29:02,876
And I'm especially good at
drawing thematic connections

724
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,445
between seemingly
disparate elements

725
00:29:04,478 --> 00:29:06,347
and using that to illustrate

726
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,916
a larger point or theory.

727
00:29:08,949 --> 00:29:13,187
So, whoever or whatever

728
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:16,924
is responsible for what
happened to Abilene,

729
00:29:16,957 --> 00:29:20,828
I will find this person

730
00:29:20,861 --> 00:29:24,898
or this generalized
societal force,

731
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:28,235
and I will define it.

732
00:29:29,236 --> 00:29:31,138

877
00:36:32,593 --> 00:36:34,595
Yes, but they're
all right there.

878
00:36:35,563 --> 00:36:39,499
In this scenario,
they're all right there.

Asking why you love Whataburger

883
00:36:49,877 --> 00:36:51,579
is like asking why
you love Christmas

884
00:36:51,612 --> 00:36:54,982
or a summer night or
why you love your dog.

885
00:36:55,016 --> 00:36:57,284
I mean, you could
point to the reasons,

886
00:36:57,317 --> 00:36:59,587
but the reasons aren't
really the point.

887
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:04,224

I want to share
an idea with you.

917
00:38:53,433 --> 00:38:57,104
There's no argument
more profound

918
00:38:57,138 --> 00:39:00,440
than how the universe
came into existence.

919
00:39:00,473 --> 00:39:02,152
- (quietly): Oh, God.
- Are we here because of God

920
00:39:02,176 --> 00:39:03,544
or science?

921
00:39:03,578 --> 00:39:06,848
I mean, it is, by
its very nature,

922
00:39:06,881 --> 00:39:09,482
the most fundamental question.

923
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:14,822
But there's one thing
that everyone agrees on.

924
00:39:16,123 --> 00:39:19,760
And that is whether
it was God declaring,

925
00:39:19,794 --> 00:39:22,597
"Let there be light,"

926
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:25,633

and I mean everyone,

930
00:39:34,575 --> 00:39:38,913
agrees that the universe

931
00:39:38,946 --> 00:39:41,649
started with a sound.

932
00:39:44,785 --> 00:39:47,088

-You know, after Andy Warhol's Factory.
-Hmm.

959
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,301
Most people around here
think it's a reference

960
00:41:31,325 --> 00:41:33,094
to C+C Music Factory.

961
00:41:33,127 --> 00:41:37,298
Which, honestly, I-I think
Warhol would've loved, but...

Yeah, actually. Yeah.

I'm from out here.

964
00:41:40,801 --> 00:41:42,203
I went to college in New Haven.

965
00:41:42,236 --> 00:41:43,871
BEN: Oh, I went to
school in Boston.

966
00:41:43,904 --> 00:41:45,706
QUENTIN: Yeah, I thought
about staying there,

967
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,842
but this is the place that
needs something like this.

968
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:50,144

people aren't smart.

969
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:52,246
The problem is that they are.

970
00:41:52,279 --> 00:41:54,048
If the landscape is like this,

971
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:57,151
a-and people were just boring,
you wouldn't have this problem.

972
00:41:57,184 --> 00:42:00,287
The problem is, you get all
these bright, creative lights

973
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:03,024
and nowhere to plug
in their energy.

974
00:42:03,057 --> 00:42:05,226
And so it gets channeled
into conspiracy theories

975
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:07,061
and drugs and violence.

976
00:42:07,094 --> 00:42:09,630

981
00:42:15,336 --> 00:42:16,913
QUENTIN: When some computer

983
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,751
-based on your favorites of those.
-Right.

984
00:42:20,775 --> 00:42:22,352
So you're listening to
a bunch of music that,

985
00:42:22,376 --> 00:42:24,645
- I mean, you genuinely like...
- Yeah.

986
00:42:24,678 --> 00:42:26,147
But you have no
idea who sings it.

987
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,783
Now, these playlists, it's
like the dating app for music.

988
00:42:28,816 --> 00:42:30,785
You're not hearing
other people's voices.

989

997
00:42:53,841 --> 00:42:55,810
You think half the people
that are posting quotes

998
00:42:55,843 --> 00:42:58,345
from Oscar Wilde have ever
actually read one of his plays?

999
00:42:58,379 --> 00:42:59,680
No.

1000
00:42:59,713 --> 00:43:01,082
Or posting photos
of Audrey Hepburn

1001
00:43:01,115 --> 00:43:03,784
have actually seen the
film that it's from?

1002
00:43:03,818 --> 00:43:05,619
- No.
- Not a chance, right?

1003
00:43:05,653 --> 00:43:06,954
What is that about, huh?

1004
00:43:06,987 --> 00:43:09,824
It's the same in culture
as it is in archaeology.

1005
00:43:09,857 --> 00:43:11,959
When a civilization collapses,

1006
00:43:11,992 --> 00:43:14,361
only the tiniest
fragments remain.

1007
00:43:14,395 --> 00:43:16,297
But we can build it back again.

1008
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:18,365
How?

1009
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,301
Make recordings.

1010
00:43:20,334 --> 00:43:22,837
Real people.

1011
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:25,039
Not what people think
that they already know

1012
00:43:25,072 --> 00:43:26,407

stereotype or generic song.

Okay.

1019
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:47,128

Who is it about?

1021
00:43:49,697 --> 00:43:51,098
All of us.

1022
00:43:51,132 --> 00:43:54,735
Every story we tell is
ultimately about a person.

1023
00:43:56,036 --> 00:43:57,371
Abilene Shaw.

1024
00:43:57,404 --> 00:43:59,340
Abilene.

1025
00:43:59,373 --> 00:44:01,142
Yeah.

1026
00:44:01,175 --> 00:44:04,011
You're making a
podcast about Abilene.

1027
00:44:04,044 --> 00:44:05,713
Well, it's a little
about Abilene.

1028
00:44:05,746 --> 00:44:07,414
-I'm trying to make it more about...
-No.

1029
00:44:07,448 --> 00:44:09,283
It's about Abilene.

1030
00:44:09,316 --> 00:44:10,284
The person.

1031
00:44:10,317 --> 00:44:11,719
That's all you need.

1032
00:44:11,752 --> 00:44:13,154
What did you think
about her music?

1033
00:44:13,187 --> 00:44:14,355
I haven't really heard it.

1034
00:44:14,388 --> 00:44:15,890
Shut the front door.

1035
00:44:15,923 --> 00:44:18,792
- I mean, I have...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

1036
00:44:21,061 --> 00:44:23,664
Come with me.

1037
00:44:24,298 --> 00:44:25,799
Here it is.

1038
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:27,168
Everything we ever recorded.

1039
00:44:27,201 --> 00:44:29,161

- You're in for a treat.

1040
00:44:30,104 --> 00:44:32,773

who wants to be a singer?

1041
00:44:32,806 --> 00:44:34,341
BEN: Wants to be famous.

1042
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:36,343
QUENTIN: Means she
knows she's somebody.

1043
00:44:36,377 --> 00:44:38,379
Just doesn't know who yet.

1044
00:44:38,412 --> 00:44:40,814
She needs to find her voice.

1045
00:44:41,482 --> 00:44:42,917
What about my voice?

1046
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:44,785
I'll put you in the studio.

1047
00:44:44,818 --> 00:44:46,287
What do you want to do?

1048
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,089

you know, my
writing, my podcast,

1051
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:58,699
what would you tell me?

1052
00:45:00,267 --> 00:45:04,972
I'd probably say that
nobody writes anything.

1053
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,342
All we do is translate.

1054
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:11,845
So if you ever get stuck and
you don't know what to say...

1055
00:45:12,547 --> 00:45:14,715
just listen.

1056
00:45:15,282 --> 00:45:17,885

of his plays I can think of.

1220
00:52:26,279 --> 00:52:28,382
- (cheering)
- TY: All right, Ben.

1221
00:52:28,415 --> 00:52:30,283

1222
00:52:30,317 --> 00:52:33,453
-are the six countries that Texas has belonged to.
-Okay.

1223
00:52:33,487 --> 00:52:36,223

1224
00:52:36,256 --> 00:52:38,826

Um, uh... Republic of Texas!

1227
00:52:43,765 --> 00:52:44,966
What's that, five?

1228
00:52:44,999 --> 00:52:46,668
Not bad, brother. Not bad.

1229
00:52:46,701 --> 00:52:48,636
Nobody ever gets five.

1230
00:52:51,438 --> 00:52:52,807
Right.

1231
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,475
So Six Flags, the theme park...

1232
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:56,944
TY: Exactly.

1233
00:52:56,978 --> 00:52:58,980

00:52:59,013 --> 00:53:00,682
("Deep in the Heart

1235
00:53:00,715 --> 00:53:02,416
Very interesting.

1236
00:53:02,449 --> 00:53:04,628
ANNOUNCER (over headphones):
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

1237
00:53:04,652 --> 00:53:05,920

1238
00:53:05,953 --> 00:53:08,221
you know what to do
when this song plays.

1239
00:53:08,255 --> 00:53:10,457
(crowd humming along to song)

1240
00:53:13,861 --> 00:53:15,863
Did you really
just try to Shazam

1241
00:53:15,897 --> 00:53:17,899
- "Deep in the Heart of Texas"?
- Uh...

1242
00:53:17,932 --> 00:53:19,000
No.

1243
00:53:19,033 --> 00:53:20,635
(crowd clapping)

1244
00:53:20,668 --> 00:53:22,713
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
who here is a die-hard fan

1245
00:53:22,737 --> 00:53:24,839
of the University of Texas?

1246
00:53:24,872 --> 00:53:26,774
Whoo!

1247
00:53:28,609 --> 00:53:31,746
ANNOUNCER: And who here
is a fan of Texas Tech?

1248
00:53:31,779 --> 00:53:33,815
(cheering loudly)

1249
00:53:36,818 --> 00:53:39,352
Okay, let's hear
from both sides.

1250
00:53:39,386 --> 00:53:41,321
Can we have the
UT fan come down?

1251
00:53:41,354 --> 00:53:42,599
- PARIS: Good luck, buddy.
- CRAWL: Give them hell, Ben.

1252
00:53:42,623 --> 00:53:44,525
Is this for real?
Are you seriou...

1253
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:46,326
PARIS: Do you
think we're joking?

1254
00:53:46,359 --> 00:53:49,396
ANNOUNCER: And let's
get a Texas Tech fan.

1255
00:53:49,429 --> 00:53:51,632
(crowd cheering loudly)

1256
00:54:00,041 --> 00:54:03,010
Okay, let's start with
Mr. University of Texas.

1257
00:54:03,044 --> 00:54:04,545
(crowd jeering)

1258
00:54:04,579 --> 00:54:06,023
ANNOUNCER: Now,
what's your name, son?

1259
00:54:06,047 --> 00:54:07,481
Ben Manalowitz.

1260
00:54:07,515 --> 00:54:09,617
- What the whosit?
- (comical whistle plays)

1261
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:11,351
(laughter)

1262
00:54:11,384 --> 00:54:12,920
And what do you do, son?

1263
00:54:12,954 --> 00:54:14,589
I'm a writer.

1264
00:54:14,622 --> 00:54:15,489
A rider?

1265
00:54:15,523 --> 00:54:16,758
You don't look like a rider.

1266
00:54:16,791 --> 00:54:17,859
What do you ride, son?

1267
00:54:17,892 --> 00:54:19,493
Huh?

1268
00:54:19,527 --> 00:54:21,038
ANNOUNCER: Well, there's
lots of kinds of riding.

1269
00:54:21,062 --> 00:54:23,798
You can ride horses,
steer, tractors.

1270
00:54:23,831 --> 00:54:24,999
No.

1271
00:54:25,032 --> 00:54:27,668
I'm not a rider. I'm a writer.

1272
00:54:28,669 --> 00:54:31,304
I'm a writer.

1273
00:54:31,338 --> 00:54:33,941
So, like, you know, uh...

1274
00:54:33,975 --> 00:54:38,813
when... when you come across
a book or a magazine...

1275
00:54:39,781 --> 00:54:43,450
or even an article
that you read online.

1276
00:54:44,085 --> 00:54:45,653
Somebody has to...

1277
00:54:45,686 --> 00:54:48,388
has to actually think
about what those words...

1278
00:54:48,421 --> 00:54:50,658
I know what a writer is,
you condescending asshole.

1279
00:54:50,691 --> 00:54:52,093
(crowd jeering)

1280
00:54:52,126 --> 00:54:53,094
(scattered laughter)

1281
00:54:53,127 --> 00:54:54,729
Well, tell me, Shakespeare,

1282
00:54:54,762 --> 00:54:57,932
what do you like so much
about the University of Texas?

1283
00:54:57,965 --> 00:55:00,400
(jeering)

1284
00:55:01,434 --> 00:55:04,404
Well, I like that
it's a state school.

1285
00:55:04,437 --> 00:55:07,407
So, it gives financial
opportunities

1286
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,511
to local people who
could use the help.

1287
00:55:10,545 --> 00:55:14,849
And I know that it has a
very good film department.

1288
00:55:14,882 --> 00:55:17,051
Some of the graduates include,

1289
00:55:17,084 --> 00:55:18,786
I believe, Richard Linklater.

1290
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:20,988
Uh-huh. Okay.

1291
00:55:21,022 --> 00:55:23,758
And what do you like
about Texas Tech?

1292
00:55:23,791 --> 00:55:26,828

- Nobody's thinking about it.
- Yeah.

1301
00:55:41,776 --> 00:55:43,110
Erase it from your mind.

1302
00:55:43,144 --> 00:55:44,846

Excuse me, are you Sancholo?

1331
00:56:50,211 --> 00:56:51,788
I was hoping to talk
to you for a second.

1332
00:56:51,812 --> 00:56:53,180
You a cop?

1333
00:56:53,214 --> 00:56:54,815
Not a cop.

1334
00:56:54,849 --> 00:56:56,550
Cop don't have to
say he's a cop.

1335
00:56:56,584 --> 00:56:58,619
Then why did you ask?

1336
00:56:58,653 --> 00:57:00,197
- Right?
- 'Cause you're wasting my time.

1337
00:57:00,221 --> 00:57:02,857
Figured I might as
well waste yours.

1338
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:04,091
Look, I'm a journalist.

1339
00:57:04,125 --> 00:57:05,860
I'm doing a story.

1340
00:57:05,893 --> 00:57:07,638
I was really only hoping to
ask you a couple of questions.

1341
00:57:07,662 --> 00:57:09,206
- I'm just trying to...
- Just trying to what?

1342
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:10,870
- Fucking killer!
- CRAWL: Hey, Ty. Relax!

1343
00:57:10,898 --> 00:57:14,502
Guys, guys, guys, guys.
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

1344
00:57:14,535 --> 00:57:17,538
Go easy on him. He
just lost his sister.

1345
00:57:18,539 --> 00:57:20,473
Most beautiful girl in Texas.

1346
00:57:20,508 --> 00:57:22,475
So what I heard was that
you were at the party

1347
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:23,911
where she died.

1348
00:57:23,945 --> 00:57:25,579
Lucky me.

1349
00:57:25,613 --> 00:57:27,748
She took her last breath

1350
00:57:27,782 --> 00:57:29,583
- on my shoulder.
- (hits shoulder)

1351
00:57:30,217 --> 00:57:32,053
(recorder beeps)

1352
00:57:32,086 --> 00:57:33,688
My name is Ben Manalowitz.

1353
00:57:33,721 --> 00:57:35,589
I'm doing a podcast
about Abilene.

1354
00:57:35,623 --> 00:57:38,726
I would love to hear
your side of the story.

1355
00:57:39,593 --> 00:57:40,594
MAN: Hey.

1356
00:57:40,628 --> 00:57:42,697
We got a regular Joe Rogan here.

1357
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:45,166
Joe Rogan meets Seth Rogen.

1358
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:47,635
(man chuckling)

1359
00:57:50,004 --> 00:57:51,939
Just you.

1360
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,576
(dog barking in distance)

1361
00:57:56,177 --> 00:57:58,746
(music playing in distance)

1362
00:58:05,586 --> 00:58:07,722
(lowering rolling door)

1363
00:58:27,174 --> 00:58:29,744
When I was in middle school,

1364
00:58:29,777 --> 00:58:33,314
my mom wouldn't let
me read <i>Harry Potter</i>

1365
00:58:33,347 --> 00:58:35,683
because of church stuff.

1366
00:58:35,716 --> 00:58:41,122
So I would call
Abby every night.

1367
00:58:41,155 --> 00:58:43,124
She would read it to me.

1368
00:58:47,728 --> 00:58:50,064
I don't know what made
her care about me.

1369
00:58:50,097 --> 00:58:51,599
I was like, "Why me?

1370
00:58:51,632 --> 00:58:54,168
I'm just an effing
dropout drug dealer."

1371
00:58:54,201 --> 00:58:57,838
She'd say, "Heart sees heart."

1372
00:58:57,872 --> 00:58:59,740
Right.

1373
00:58:59,774 --> 00:59:01,042
She used to text that to me

1374
00:59:01,075 --> 00:59:05,846
every day on that dumbass
little Razr phone.

1375
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,281
- You remember those?
- Yeah.

1376
00:59:07,314 --> 00:59:09,750
5-4-5.

1377
00:59:11,018 --> 00:59:12,820
5-4-5: Heart sees heart.

1378
00:59:12,853 --> 00:59:14,889
It was, like, her little code.

1379
00:59:17,391 --> 00:59:19,060
I miss her so much.

1380
00:59:19,093 --> 00:59:20,661
(Ben clears throat)

1381
00:59:20,694 --> 00:59:23,697
You told me that her last
breath was on your shoulder.

1382
00:59:23,731 --> 00:59:24,932
And other people told me

1383
00:59:24,965 --> 00:59:26,376
that you threw the
party where she died.

1384
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,103
I wasn't even there.

1385
00:59:30,104 --> 00:59:32,039
(chuckles): Okay.

1386
00:59:32,073 --> 00:59:34,108
Where were you?

1387
00:59:38,379 --> 00:59:39,947
(Ben clears throat)

1388
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:41,782
Look at the date.

1389
00:59:48,089 --> 00:59:49,190
Where is this?

1390
00:59:49,223 --> 00:59:52,093
Tulsa. I went to see Adele.

1391
00:59:52,126 --> 00:59:53,727
(Sancholo chuckles)

1392
00:59:53,761 --> 00:59:55,096
I was there with my niece.

1393
00:59:55,129 --> 00:59:56,831

01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:48,475
BEN (over phone): Law
enforcement was no help at all.

1569
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:51,779
You're learning a lot
down there, aren't you?

1570
01:06:51,813 --> 01:06:54,181
The murder or overdose
happened where a lot

1571
01:06:54,214 --> 01:06:55,650
of these things happen.

1572
01:06:55,683 --> 01:06:57,661
At the intersection of four
overlapping jurisdictions.

1573
01:06:57,685 --> 01:06:59,152
So they all kicked
it to each other.

1574
01:06:59,186 --> 01:07:01,054
What are the odds?

1575
01:07:01,088 --> 01:07:03,758
ELOISE: What are the odds?

1576
01:07:03,791 --> 01:07:05,527
Okay, I'm gonna kick this around

1577
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:08,161
with the team for a little
bit, shake up the Boggle board,

1578
01:07:08,195 --> 01:07:11,131
and then I'm gonna hit up
Robin to get her thoughts.

1579
01:07:11,164 --> 01:07:13,133
BEN: All right. Thanks,
Eloise. Thanks, everybody.

1580
01:07:13,166 --> 01:07:15,369
- Bye, Ben.
- Bye, Ben.

1581
01:07:16,336 --> 01:07:18,171
(sighs)

1582
01:07:19,373 --> 01:07:23,477
Um, you're probably not
even gonna watch this,

1583
01:07:23,511 --> 01:07:29,249
but I'm back home in
Texas, and I'm bored.

1584
01:07:29,283 --> 01:07:31,084
This is my little
brother, Mason.

1585
01:07:31,118 --> 01:07:32,362
- (snoring)
- He sleeps on my floor

1586
01:07:32,386 --> 01:07:34,087
because he's afraid of ghosts.

1587
01:07:34,121 --> 01:07:36,290
And I tried to tell him

1588
01:07:36,323 --> 01:07:38,492
there's no such thing
as ghosts, but whatever.

1589
01:07:38,526 --> 01:07:40,728
It keeps him close to me.

1590
01:07:41,629 --> 01:07:44,331
So I guess it's not
all bad being here.

1591
01:07:45,399 --> 01:07:47,100
That's, um...

1592
01:07:47,134 --> 01:07:49,136
Well, that's it.

1593

(El Stupido snoring softly)

1594
01:07:56,476 --> 01:07:58,211
Mason.

1595
01:07:58,846 --> 01:08:00,515
Yes, sir?

1596
01:08:04,752 --> 01:08:06,754
Just saying good night.

1597
01:08:06,788 --> 01:08:10,490
You woke me up just
to say good night?

1598
01:08:11,626 --> 01:08:13,427
Yes, sir.

1599
01:08:14,461 --> 01:08:16,363

1600
01:08:17,599 --> 01:08:20,334

Hey. It's Robin.

01:09:47,454 --> 01:09:48,723
I produce <i>American Moment.</i>

1643
01:09:48,756 --> 01:09:50,725
Yeah. I-I know who you are.

1644
01:09:50,758 --> 01:09:52,503
It's-it's, um... It's
great to meet you, Robin.

I love what you're doing

Thank you. Thank you so much.

1648

ROBIN: Eloise pitched that
we use some of the story

1649
01:10:01,002 --> 01:10:03,004
as a segment on <i>American Moment,</i>

1650
01:10:03,037 --> 01:10:04,906
and that would help
promote your series.

1651
01:10:04,939 --> 01:10:06,974
Wow. So it'd be on

01:10:20,521 --> 01:10:22,456

ROBIN: So if you think you
can tighten up what you have,

1661
01:10:24,692 --> 01:10:27,695

Wow. Yeah. Yeah, I can do that.

1665
01:10:33,701 --> 01:10:35,937
ROBIN: Can I ask
what you're eating?

1666
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:37,772
This is, um, Frito pie.

1667
01:10:37,805 --> 01:10:38,906
ROBIN: It's great sound.

1668
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:40,273
What is that?

1669
01:10:40,307 --> 01:10:41,943
(laughing): Uh, Frito pie

1670
01:10:41,976 --> 01:10:44,344
is when they cut
open a bag of Fritos

1671
01:10:44,377 --> 01:10:45,613
and they pour chili in it.

1672
01:10:45,646 --> 01:10:46,957
Then you eat it out of
the bag with a fork.

1673
01:10:46,981 --> 01:10:48,049
Ugh. That is disgusting.

1674
01:10:48,082 --> 01:10:49,517

01:11:06,667 --> 01:11:08,803

- His car blew up, Mom!

1686
01:11:23,483 --> 01:11:24,786
Oh, it's so fucked up! This...

1687
01:11:24,819 --> 01:11:26,386

- Sorry.

1688
01:11:26,419 --> 01:11:27,765
We're just so grateful
you're all right.

1689
01:11:27,789 --> 01:11:30,323

were driving a real car

1690
01:11:30,357 --> 01:11:31,526

1691
01:11:31,559 --> 01:11:33,027
- (chuckles softly)
- (Ty sighs)

1692
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:34,529
Yeah.

1693
01:11:34,562 --> 01:11:36,831
Ben, this is a message
that we're getting close.

1694
01:11:36,864 --> 01:11:41,301

for no reason with Tannerite.

1695

Come on. The girls are
waiting in the car.

1698
01:11:53,848 --> 01:11:55,382

1699
01:11:55,415 --> 01:11:56,493
- Hey, are you limping?
- No.

1700
01:11:56,517 --> 01:11:57,819
You sure about that?

1701
01:11:57,852 --> 01:11:59,596

- Yeah. His face looks all right.

1702
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:01,656

- Yeah, I seen worse.

1703
01:12:01,689 --> 01:12:03,490

Mm.

You're not supposed to do it,

You're supposed to
take your lucky number,

but we figure every
number's lucky to somebody,

so we take all of 'em.

1726
01:12:47,635 --> 01:12:49,103
I won't tell Mike and Dan.

1728
01:12:50,437 --> 01:12:51,906

You want to come tonight?

1736
01:13:03,184 --> 01:13:04,151
You can borrow something
from my closet.

1737
01:13:04,185 --> 01:13:05,686
You're okay to go?

1738
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:08,455
It doesn't stir up too
many feelings for you?

1739
01:13:10,157 --> 01:13:12,059
You gotta keep living life.

1740
01:13:12,093 --> 01:13:13,694
Like Catherine the Great said,

1741
01:13:13,728 --> 01:13:15,930
"You gotta get right
back under the horse."

1742
01:13:16,797 --> 01:13:18,733
- GRANNY: Tyler Clayton.
- (chuckles): What?

1743
01:13:18,766 --> 01:13:22,169
I-I listened to that history
podcast you recommended.

1744
01:13:22,203 --> 01:13:23,638
GRANNY: I've got a
question for you.

1745
01:13:23,671 --> 01:13:26,040
Have you got family in Texas?

1746
01:13:26,073 --> 01:13:27,675
BEN: No.

1747
01:13:27,708 --> 01:13:29,510
You do now.

1748
01:13:29,543 --> 01:13:31,579
- Isn't that right, everybody?
- PARIS: Yes, ma'am.

1749
01:13:31,612 --> 01:13:34,081
SHARON: Careful what
you wish for, Ben.

1750
01:13:34,115 --> 01:13:36,416
(ringtone playing)

1751
01:13:37,952 --> 01:13:39,654
One second.

1752
01:13:39,687 --> 01:13:41,454
GRANNY: Who's got a
honey thing over there?

1753
01:13:41,488 --> 01:13:43,991
- Um, I got some right here.
- Anybody? Mmm, mmm, mmm.

1754
01:13:44,025 --> 01:13:46,527
- Hey. What's up?
- ELOISE: Hey.

1755
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:47,929
Your car blew up?

1756
01:13:47,962 --> 01:13:49,664
Are you okay?

1757
01:13:49,697 --> 01:13:50,731
Yeah. Yes.

1758
01:13:50,765 --> 01:13:53,200
I mean, I wish I got that
extra rental insurance

1759
01:13:53,234 --> 01:13:55,468
that no one ever
gets, but I'm fine.

1760
01:13:55,503 --> 01:13:57,238
Good. Well, listen,
I finished it,

1761
01:13:57,271 --> 01:13:58,639
and everyone loves it.

1762
01:13:58,673 --> 01:14:00,207
Thanks. What do you
mean "finished it"?

1763
01:14:00,241 --> 01:14:01,809
You're clearly in danger,

1764
01:14:01,842 --> 01:14:04,679
and you've already got
everything you need.

1765
01:14:04,712 --> 01:14:08,082
Well, I didn't solve the murder.

1766
01:14:08,115 --> 01:14:09,850
It's better this way.

1767
01:14:09,884 --> 01:14:12,887
You know, an ambiguous
ending without resolution.

1768
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:17,158
That's... that's the secret
weapon with a story like this.

1769
01:14:17,191 --> 01:14:18,526
It gnaws at you.

1770
01:14:18,559 --> 01:14:21,162
It haunts you forever.

1771
01:14:21,195 --> 01:14:22,563
You never let it go.

1772
01:14:22,596 --> 01:14:23,707
BEN: No, there's
more to it, Eloise.

1773
01:14:23,731 --> 01:14:24,966
I-I'm getting so close.

1774
01:14:24,999 --> 01:14:26,701
ELOISE: As much as
we'd love to see you

1775
01:14:26,734 --> 01:14:28,703
- blown up for a story...
- No, no.

1776
01:14:28,736 --> 01:14:30,237
My conscience tells me

1777
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:32,173
I have to choose a
person over a story.

1778
01:14:32,206 --> 01:14:33,908
No.

1779
01:14:33,941 --> 01:14:35,009
No, no.

1780
01:14:35,042 --> 01:14:38,713
Otherwise, it would take,
like, two years of therapy

1781
01:14:38,746 --> 01:14:41,115
to justify it, and...

1782
01:14:41,148 --> 01:14:43,551
I can't afford that on my plan.

1783
01:14:43,584 --> 01:14:46,020
Look, you're gonna
be huge from this.

1784
01:14:46,053 --> 01:14:47,188
Okay?

1785
01:14:47,221 --> 01:14:48,255
Come home.

1786
01:14:48,289 --> 01:14:50,224

1789
01:14:55,029 --> 01:14:56,764
Hey. Sorry about that.

1790
01:14:56,797 --> 01:14:58,265
EL STUPIDO: Who was that?

1791
01:14:58,299 --> 01:15:00,267
Friend.

1792
01:15:00,301 --> 01:15:02,003
Was it Equinox Girl Cute?

1793
01:15:02,036 --> 01:15:03,804
Or was it Natalie Bumble?

1794
01:15:03,838 --> 01:15:05,740
Uh, it was, uh, my
podcast producer.

1795
01:15:05,773 --> 01:15:08,743
Uh, and everything's on track.

1796
01:15:08,776 --> 01:15:10,277
You're very sweet to ask.

1797
01:15:10,311 --> 01:15:12,213
I love you mucho.

1798
01:15:12,246 --> 01:15:14,715
We're so lucky
you found Abilene.

I get it. I totally get it.

1802
01:15:22,590 --> 01:15:24,558
- Heart sees heart.
- Oh. (laughs softly)

1803
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:30,064
You know, when I came down here
to spend time with Abby's...

1804

"Crazy Texan family," right?

1805

it would be like this.

but I understand
that everyone here

1837
01:16:54,181 --> 01:16:55,292

with the latter.

1838
01:16:55,316 --> 01:16:56,650

01:17:06,026 --> 01:17:07,328
Well, I was following my heart,

1844

we do around here.

Yeah.

01:17:13,334 --> 01:17:15,269
Well, maybe it's
time to look around

1848
01:17:15,302 --> 01:17:18,305
and ask yourselves how
that's working out for you.

1849
01:17:18,339 --> 01:17:21,742
Maybe you should try following
your brain for a change.

1850

Because when you
follow your heart,

1851

the Earth is flat,

1852
01:17:25,713 --> 01:17:27,281
climate change is a hoax,

1853
01:17:27,314 --> 01:17:30,151
vaccines contain microchips,

1854
01:17:30,184 --> 01:17:33,754
and Mexican drug dealers
killed your sister.

1855
01:17:33,787 --> 01:17:36,891
You invent these insane
fucking narratives

1856
01:17:36,924 --> 01:17:39,160
to explain why your
lives are such shit shows

1857

because the truth is too
scary for you to face,

1858

which is that you
did it to yourselves.

1859

Do you know what people say
about you guys where I'm from?

1860

- No. Worse.

01:18:40,988 --> 01:18:43,324
First of all, I wouldn't have
needed a car in Brooklyn.

1882
01:18:43,357 --> 01:18:46,360
Second, if I had one, I doubt
it would've been blown up

1883

"You people" is a
microaggression.

1886
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:54,802
My apologies. Y'all.

1887
01:18:54,835 --> 01:18:57,137
"Y'all" is a cultural
appropriation.

1888
01:18:57,171 --> 01:18:59,139
(chuckles): Paris...

you accusing someone of
cultural appropriation

1890
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:04,478
is cultural appropriation.

1891
01:19:04,512 --> 01:19:07,381
Why wouldn't you look after her?

1892
01:19:07,414 --> 01:19:09,250
Check in on her?

1893
01:19:09,283 --> 01:19:11,785
You wouldn't do anything
for her, would you?

1894
01:19:11,819 --> 01:19:14,021
That's right. I wouldn't.

1895
01:19:14,054 --> 01:19:16,558
I was hooking up with
different people,

1896
01:19:16,591 --> 01:19:18,993
and I assumed she was, too,

1897
01:19:19,026 --> 01:19:22,296
because I live in
the real world,

1898
01:19:22,329 --> 01:19:25,032
and that's what everybody does.

1899
01:19:25,065 --> 01:19:27,835
I tried to tell you
this when you called.

1900
01:19:27,868 --> 01:19:29,803
She wasn't my girlfriend.

1901
01:19:29,837 --> 01:19:32,940

I'll tell you what I think.

1911
01:20:08,610 --> 01:20:12,012
I think people don't
do drugs for no reason.

1912
01:20:12,046 --> 01:20:14,315
They do drugs because
they're in pain.

1913
01:20:14,348 --> 01:20:16,183
Pain like...

1914
01:20:16,216 --> 01:20:19,219
like maybe caring for someone
who hardly knows your name.

1915
01:20:20,622 --> 01:20:22,956
So, I don't know, Ben.

01:29:30,538 --> 01:29:32,472
- brought in the opium den.
- Mm.

2086
01:29:32,506 --> 01:29:36,476
And this country was
so anti-immigrant

2087
01:29:36,510 --> 01:29:39,747
that they banned the opium den.

2088
01:29:40,548 --> 01:29:42,083
- Not the opium.
- Hmm.

2089
01:29:42,116 --> 01:29:43,618
(chuckles): Right?

2090
01:29:43,651 --> 01:29:45,620
You ever hear anything
more American than that?

2091
01:29:45,653 --> 01:29:47,622
I mean, now we got
an opium epidemic

2092
01:29:47,655 --> 01:29:49,557
breaking out across
the heartland

2093
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:52,894
with all the ceremony,
majesty, glamour

2094
01:29:52,927 --> 01:29:54,095
and fun's removed.

2095
01:29:54,128 --> 01:29:56,429
And-and that's what
people yearn for.

2096
01:29:56,463 --> 01:29:58,766
You see what I'm saying?

2097
01:29:59,901 --> 01:30:02,937
Do you think Gary Webb
would've won a Pulitzer today?

2098
01:30:04,538 --> 01:30:07,508
You know, I think you were
smart for staying here.

2099
01:30:07,541 --> 01:30:09,677
- BEN: Yeah?
- Yeah.

2100
01:30:09,710 --> 01:30:14,081
That story about
Abilene, it's nice.

2101
01:30:15,049 --> 01:30:18,451
I think you were meant
to tell a bigger story.

2102
01:30:18,485 --> 01:30:21,656
Ask yourself, what part
of the country today

2103
01:30:21,689 --> 01:30:24,191
is it in certain
people's interest

2104
01:30:24,225 --> 01:30:26,928
to keep devastated, demoralized,

2105
01:30:26,961 --> 01:30:29,664
dependent and divided?

2106
01:30:29,697 --> 01:30:31,498
You got the opioid crisis,

2107
01:30:31,532 --> 01:30:33,901
nation in divide, civic unrest.

2108
01:30:33,935 --> 01:30:37,505
Why are all these things
happening at the same time?

2109
01:30:37,538 --> 01:30:39,807
What do you really
think is going on here?

2110
01:30:40,708 --> 01:30:42,843
(fireworks continue
popping in distance)

2111
01:30:43,678 --> 01:30:46,479
Told you I had a story for you.

2112
01:30:49,283 --> 01:30:51,686
(woman laughs quietly)

2113
01:30:55,623 --> 01:30:57,091
BEN: So what are you saying?

2114
01:30:57,124 --> 01:30:58,526
That it all connects?

2115
01:30:58,559 --> 01:31:01,662
That the conspiracy
theories are true?

2116
01:31:01,696 --> 01:31:03,564
QUENTIN: What I'm saying is

2117
01:31:03,597 --> 01:31:07,101
people can sense the truth,

2118
01:31:07,134 --> 01:31:09,704
but they're grasping
for the facts.

2119
01:31:09,737 --> 01:31:13,607
See, a myth is just a
truth without facts.

2120
01:31:13,641 --> 01:31:15,977
That's why it comes out
all abstract, gnarled,

2121
01:31:16,010 --> 01:31:17,745
wrong.

2122
01:31:18,546 --> 01:31:19,880
Easy to dismiss and ridicule.

2123
01:31:19,914 --> 01:31:22,149
Nobody listens to them

2124
01:31:22,183 --> 01:31:24,852
because they don't
have the facts.

2125
01:31:26,554 --> 01:31:28,155
But I do.

2126
01:31:28,189 --> 01:31:29,256
And you, Ben...

2127
01:31:29,290 --> 01:31:30,958
Yeah.

2128
01:31:32,626 --> 01:31:35,096
(whispers): the whole damn
world will listen to you.

2129
01:31:36,897 --> 01:31:38,833
(rustling)

2130
01:31:42,303 --> 01:31:44,005
Where are they going?

2131
01:31:44,038 --> 01:31:45,873
Afterparty.

2132
01:31:47,308 --> 01:31:48,876
The Afterparty.

2133
01:31:48,909 --> 01:31:50,711
Tell me about that.

2134
01:31:50,745 --> 01:31:54,015
I mean, people overdose a
hundred times a day, Ben.

2135
01:31:54,048 --> 01:31:55,649
That's a fact.

2136
01:31:55,683 --> 01:31:57,027
But they can't do it in a
place where it's gonna be

2137
01:31:57,051 --> 01:31:59,653
a problem for people
like you and I. Hmm?

2138
01:32:01,055 --> 01:32:03,057
That's what happened to Abilene.

2139
01:32:04,792 --> 01:32:06,327
Abilene?

2140
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:10,031
I mean, she died at
a party like this.

2141
01:32:11,799 --> 01:32:13,667
I thought you
finished that story.

2142
01:32:13,701 --> 01:32:15,569
Oh. (laughs softly)

2143
01:32:15,603 --> 01:32:17,738
This is just for us.

2144
01:32:17,772 --> 01:32:20,341
Well, it's not a very
good story anyway.

2145
01:32:20,374 --> 01:32:22,576
Oh, she was a drug addict.

2146
01:32:22,610 --> 01:32:24,211
She OD'd.

2147
01:32:24,245 --> 01:32:26,947
Then she tried to call 911.

2148
01:32:27,815 --> 01:32:30,951
Oh. In Texas, we don't call 911.

2149
01:32:30,985 --> 01:32:32,953
Yeah, I've heard that.

2150
01:32:33,821 --> 01:32:35,956
They record all those calls.

2151
01:32:35,990 --> 01:32:39,126
We gotta be very careful
about what gets recorded.

2152
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:41,062
Yeah. You do.

2153
01:32:41,095 --> 01:32:44,031
It's all that's left of us.

2154
01:32:44,065 --> 01:32:45,666
The recordings.

2155
01:32:46,367 --> 01:32:49,670
And people like
you and I, Abilene,

2156
01:32:49,703 --> 01:32:54,175
everybody posting photos
of every part of their day,

2157
01:32:54,208 --> 01:32:58,012
we trade in our entire lives

2158
01:32:58,045 --> 01:33:02,016
for the tiny pieces
that get recorded of us.

2159
01:33:04,318 --> 01:33:05,820
Abilene tried to call 911.

2160
01:33:05,853 --> 01:33:07,688
You didn't let her. Then what?

2161
01:33:07,721 --> 01:33:10,391
(fireworks whistle, pop loudly)

2162
01:33:10,424 --> 01:33:11,826
Oh, boy.

2163
01:33:11,859 --> 01:33:13,894
Don't get distracted.

2164
01:33:13,928 --> 01:33:16,230
You gotta admit, that's
a hell of a distraction.

2165
01:33:16,263 --> 01:33:18,999
(laughs) That is...
That's kind of like

2166
01:33:19,033 --> 01:33:20,701
the very definition
of distraction.

2167
01:33:20,734 --> 01:33:23,270
- Abilene.
- ♪ Abilene. ♪

2168
01:33:23,304 --> 01:33:26,240
- Abilene.
- (deep voice): ♪ Abilene. ♪

2169
01:33:26,273 --> 01:33:28,075
What happened to Abilene?

2170
01:33:28,876 --> 01:33:30,911
Do you believe in ghosts, Ben?

2171
01:33:30,945 --> 01:33:33,981
I got a call from
a ghost earlier.

2172
01:33:35,349 --> 01:33:38,219
Kind of thought I'd
be seeing you today.

2173
01:33:40,688 --> 01:33:42,389
What happened to her?

2174
01:33:42,423 --> 01:33:44,625
Why do you care so much?

2175
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:49,063
Why do you care so little?

2176
01:33:49,096 --> 01:33:51,432
(fireworks popping)

2177
01:33:51,465 --> 01:33:54,268
She overdosed.

2178
01:33:54,301 --> 01:33:55,736
Instead of helping her,

2179
01:33:55,769 --> 01:33:58,405
you dragged her
to the Afterparty,

2180
01:33:58,439 --> 01:33:59,816
which is a spot with
no cell reception

2181
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,008
at the exact intersection

2182
01:34:01,041 --> 01:34:04,044
of four overlapping
law jurisdictions

2183
01:34:04,078 --> 01:34:05,412
where you knew her death

2184
01:34:05,446 --> 01:34:09,150
would just become an
anonymous statistic.

2185
01:34:09,183 --> 01:34:11,819
Hmm.

2186
01:34:16,323 --> 01:34:18,159
It's well said.

2187
01:34:18,192 --> 01:34:19,660
Very succinct.

2188
01:34:22,930 --> 01:34:26,100
Yes. That's exactly
what happened.

2189
01:34:31,305 --> 01:34:33,374
(Quentin laughs softly)

2190
01:34:33,407 --> 01:34:36,177
Brilliant.

2191
01:34:36,210 --> 01:34:38,112
You got it.

2192
01:34:38,145 --> 01:34:39,747
You got it all.

2193
01:34:39,780 --> 01:34:43,117
That's a story about America.

2194
01:34:43,150 --> 01:34:45,920
Let me know if you need
me to rerecord anything.

2195
01:34:45,953 --> 01:34:47,788
Or, like, rephrase things.

2196
01:34:47,821 --> 01:34:49,924
I can do that, too.

2197
01:34:50,925 --> 01:34:51,992
What?

2198
01:34:52,026 --> 01:34:53,227
Oh, come...

2199
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:54,929
You and I are gonna
be sitting on a panel

2200
01:34:54,962 --> 01:34:56,439
talking about this. I
want it to be great.

2201
01:34:56,463 --> 01:34:59,133
We both know how
this works. Right?

2202
01:34:59,166 --> 01:35:00,467
Yeah, I-I mean, at first,

2203
01:35:00,502 --> 01:35:05,239
everyone's gonna think
you got your bad guy.

2204
01:35:07,074 --> 01:35:09,410
Nobody's gonna let
it be that simple.

2205
01:35:09,443 --> 01:35:10,887
Everyone's gonna have
to have their take

2206
01:35:10,911 --> 01:35:13,814
'cause that's how it works now.

2207
01:35:13,847 --> 01:35:16,016
Everyone has a take.

2208
01:35:16,050 --> 01:35:17,928
See, if you don't have a
take, you don't have a voice.

2209
01:35:17,952 --> 01:35:19,887
If you don't have a
voice, you don't exist.

2210
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:25,025
So yeah, at first,
everyone's gonna blame me.

2211
01:35:25,059 --> 01:35:29,096
But then someone's gonna
say, "Wait a second."

2212
01:35:29,129 --> 01:35:33,767
There's a big difference
between leaving somebody to die

2213
01:35:33,801 --> 01:35:36,136
and killing somebody.

2214
01:35:37,838 --> 01:35:39,773
Then they're gonna turn to you.

2215
01:35:40,575 --> 01:35:43,844
What were you doing
here in the first place?

2216
01:35:43,877 --> 01:35:46,013
What was your
relationship with her?

2217
01:35:46,046 --> 01:35:50,451
Why would you exploit
her grieving family?

2218
01:35:50,484 --> 01:35:52,253
(laughing): Those...

2219
01:35:52,286 --> 01:35:53,954
Those characters.

2220
01:35:53,988 --> 01:35:57,391
I mean... I mean, that's
what they're gonna be.

2221
01:35:57,424 --> 01:35:59,493
Famous characters.

2222
01:35:59,527 --> 01:36:01,161
Not famous people.

2223
01:36:01,195 --> 01:36:03,797
And then they're gonna
blame the family.

2224
01:36:03,831 --> 01:36:06,166
Oh, I hope they're
ready for that.

2225
01:36:07,901 --> 01:36:09,537
They'll blame the president.

2226
01:36:09,571 --> 01:36:11,573
The last president.

2227
01:36:11,606 --> 01:36:13,207
(sputtering)

2228
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:15,118
And then they'll start in
with the conspiracy theories.

2229
01:36:15,142 --> 01:36:17,545
You know, and someone will
refute the conspiracy theories,

2230
01:36:17,579 --> 01:36:23,217
and then one side will make
their version like their cause.

2231
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:25,919
And the other side will
take the other side

2232
01:36:25,953 --> 01:36:30,024
just to take the other
side and on, and on.

2233
01:36:30,057 --> 01:36:33,561
Until your story proves

2234
01:36:33,595 --> 01:36:37,298
the defining truth of our time.

2235
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:40,602
Which is what?

2236
01:36:40,635 --> 01:36:45,607
Everything means everything.

2237
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:50,244
So nothing means anything.

2238
01:36:51,979 --> 01:36:53,947
("American" by Lana
Del Rey playing)

2239
01:36:53,981 --> 01:36:56,917
Some things mean something.

2240
01:36:58,485 --> 01:37:00,054
Yeah?

2241
01:37:00,087 --> 01:37:01,221
Like what?

2242
01:37:02,222 --> 01:37:03,957
Abilene?

2243
01:37:04,626 --> 01:37:06,460
(scoffs) You didn't
care about her.

2244
01:37:06,493 --> 01:37:09,129
You came here for yourself.

2245
01:37:09,163 --> 01:37:11,999
- (fireworks popping)
- For recording.

2246
01:37:12,032 --> 01:37:14,935
And then you heard her music.

2247
01:37:14,968 --> 01:37:16,236
And you saw her photos.

2248
01:37:16,270 --> 01:37:19,006
The record of her.

2249
01:37:19,641 --> 01:37:22,242
And that's what you care for.

2250
01:37:23,243 --> 01:37:25,112
A recording.

2251
01:37:26,246 --> 01:37:28,182
Not a person.

2252
01:37:31,519 --> 01:37:34,388
We are all...

2253
01:37:34,421 --> 01:37:37,458
just inspirations

2254
01:37:37,491 --> 01:37:40,094
for the record of ourselves.

2255
01:37:40,127 --> 01:37:41,629
You and I both know it.

2256
01:37:41,663 --> 01:37:43,997
You got your opus.

2257
01:37:44,031 --> 01:37:46,634
And that's what matters.

2258
01:37:46,668 --> 01:37:48,469
But Abilene?

2259
01:37:48,503 --> 01:37:50,371
The person?

2260
01:37:50,404 --> 01:37:51,606
