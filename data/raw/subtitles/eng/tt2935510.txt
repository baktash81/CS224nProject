00:12:45,776 --> 00:12:48,911
My father's alive, sir?

176
00:12:48,913 --> 00:12:51,179
We believe so.

177
00:12:51,181 --> 00:12:53,682
STROUD: Roy, The Surge
seems to be the result

178
00:12:53,684 --> 00:12:56,485
of some kind
of anti-matter reaction.

179
00:12:56,487 --> 00:12:59,288
Now, the Lima Project was
powered by that material...

180
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,392
and your father
was in charge of it.

181
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,124
Now, we're talking about

182
00:13:03,126 --> 00:13:06,929
a potentially unstoppable
chain reaction here.

183
00:13:06,931 --> 00:13:09,130
The uncontrolled release
of anti-matter...

184
00:13:09,132 --> 00:13:10,499
could ultimately threaten

185
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:14,035
the stability of
our entire solar system.

186
00:13:14,037 --> 00:13:16,707
All life could be destroyed.

187
00:13:18,074 --> 00:13:21,008
Major, we would
like you to send

188
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,978
a personal message on Mars
by secure laser...

189
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,716
to what we hope
is the Lima Project.

190
00:13:27,718 --> 00:13:28,851
The text of your message

191
00:13:28,853 --> 00:13:31,118
would be prepared in advance,
of course.

192
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,222
Mars, sir?
I'm going to Mars?

193
00:13:34,224 --> 00:13:37,761
It is the last secure hub
we have.

194
00:13:39,128 --> 00:13:41,763
STROUD: Roy,
we need to find out

195
00:13:41,765 --> 00:13:43,998
just what
we're up against here.

196
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,434
Our underground Mars base

197
00:13:45,436 --> 00:13:49,304
was the only one
unaffected by The Surge.

198
00:13:49,306 --> 00:13:51,138
And we believe
a personal plea,

199
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,610
from you to your father,
might elicit a response.

200
00:13:54,612 --> 00:13:56,345
We can track that signal...

201
00:13:56,347 --> 00:13:59,948
locate him and figure out
a way to stop this.

202
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:05,687
What is happening out there is
a crisis of unknown magnitude.

203
00:14:05,689 --> 00:14:09,090
Now, we're counting on you
to help us find him.

204
00:14:09,092 --> 00:14:11,160
Are you with us?

205
00:14:14,298 --> 00:14:16,899
- Yes, I am, sir.
- STROUD: Good.

206
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:18,634
You deploy first
to the moon.

207
00:14:18,636 --> 00:14:19,935

208
00:14:19,937 --> 00:14:21,303

on the Far Side.

209
00:14:21,305 --> 00:14:23,305
Everything after that will be
on a need-to-know basis.

210
00:14:23,307 --> 00:14:24,238
Yes, sir.

211
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,375
Given the magnitude
of the threat...

212
00:14:26,377 --> 00:14:30,312
a cover story is being
formulated to avoid all panic.

213
00:14:30,314 --> 00:14:32,681

we've met.

250
00:16:31,135 --> 00:16:34,438
It was a long time ago.
I knew your dad.

251
00:16:35,305 --> 00:16:37,305
We were close,
he and I.

252
00:16:37,307 --> 00:16:41,278
We started out together,
went to Purdue together.

253
00:16:42,112 --> 00:16:44,012
He was a brilliant man.

254
00:16:44,014 --> 00:16:46,114
- I know.
- Yeah.

255
00:16:46,116 --> 00:16:48,483
And I remember going
to the house and seeing you.

256
00:16:48,485 --> 00:16:50,652
You were running around
everywhere.

257
00:16:50,654 --> 00:16:53,755

poor mother nuts, but...

I was a lunar astronaut
for SPACECOM for 31 years.

269
00:17:33,197 --> 00:17:36,698
And I came to the
realization out there...

270
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,335
a voyage of exploration
can be used

271
00:17:40,337 --> 00:17:43,872

as simple as escape.

01:50:27,037 --> 01:50:28,470
MAN: <i>Coming in, clean.</i>

1377
01:50:28,472 --> 01:50:30,341
<i>Copy that. Thanks.</i>

1378
01:50:31,241 --> 01:50:34,175
<i>One ready to go.
Data is good.</i>

1379
01:50:34,177 --> 01:50:36,347
<i>We have all good. All good.</i>

1380
01:51:14,385 --> 01:51:16,152
You're all right, Major.

1381
01:51:35,573 --> 01:51:39,410
ROY: <i>I'm steady, calm.</i>

1382
01:51:40,210 --> 01:51:43,213
I slept well. No bad dreams.

1383
01:51:45,616 --> 01:51:48,985
I am active and engaged.

1384
01:51:52,590 --> 01:51:53,988
<i>I'm aware of my surroundings</i>

1385
01:51:53,990 --> 01:51:56,527
<i>and those
in my immediate sphere.</i>

1386
01:51:58,295 --> 01:51:59,896
I'm attentive.

1387
01:52:03,933 --> 01:52:05,834
<i>I'm focused
on the essential...</i>

1388
01:52:05,836 --> 01:52:08,305
<i>to the exclusion
of all else.</i>

1389
01:52:24,921 --> 01:52:27,989
I'm unsure of the future...

1390
01:52:27,991 --> 01:52:29,593
but I'm not concerned.

1391
01:52:35,031 --> 01:52:38,134
I will rely
on those closest to me.

1392
01:52:42,440 --> 01:52:45,008
<i>And I will share
their burdens...</i>

1393
01:52:53,183 --> 01:52:55,118
as they share mine.

1394
01:53:00,391 --> 01:53:01,659
I will live...

1395
01:53:03,294 --> 01:53:05,128
and love.

1396
01:53:11,869 --> 01:53:13,270
Submit.
