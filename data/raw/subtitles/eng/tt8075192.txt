2
00:01:39,202 --> 00:01:40,202
Hey.

3
00:03:02,119 --> 00:03:06,706
SHOPLIFTERS

4
00:03:10,962 --> 00:03:12,505
Five croquettes, please.

5
00:03:12,712 --> 00:03:16,091
Five croquettes, sure.
That'll be 450 yen.

6
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,428
- How much?
- 450 yen.

7
00:03:21,973 --> 00:03:23,307
A crusher...

8
00:03:24,432 --> 00:03:27,061
is shaped like a hammer.

9
00:03:28,688 --> 00:03:31,857
One blow with that thing
shatters any glass to bits.

10
00:03:32,732 --> 00:03:33,985
How much is it?

11
00:03:34,986 --> 00:03:36,154
About 2,000 yen.

12
00:03:37,904 --> 00:03:38,904
Expensive.

13
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,618
- If you buy it.
- Here you go.

14
00:03:45,496 --> 00:03:46,497
Tasty.

15
00:03:48,498 --> 00:03:51,376
That store makes
the best croquettes.

16
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,713
You're right.

17
00:03:56,006 --> 00:03:57,425
Man, it's cold.

18
00:03:59,385 --> 00:04:00,970
- What?
- I forgot shampoo.

19
00:04:02,012 --> 00:04:04,682
Let's get it the next time.
It's so cold.

20
00:04:09,353 --> 00:04:11,022
Feels like it's going to snow.

21
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:12,481
Yeah.

22
00:04:23,618 --> 00:04:24,786
She's there again.

23
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:31,666
Say...

24
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,003
What's wrong?

25
00:04:37,714 --> 00:04:38,799
Where's your mommy?

26
00:04:40,092 --> 00:04:41,260
Hey, let's go.

27
00:04:41,551 --> 00:04:43,887
They'll get cold.

28
00:04:45,347 --> 00:04:46,598
But, she's...

29
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:52,063
Say, want to eat a croquette?

30
00:04:54,106 --> 00:04:55,358
Want to eat a croquette?

31
00:05:03,782 --> 00:05:07,410
Can't you bring home
something to make us money?

32
00:05:08,537 --> 00:05:11,039
Your husband isn't good
at sniffing out profits.

33
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,960
Shota, where's the shampoo?

34
00:05:14,376 --> 00:05:15,376
I forgot.

35
00:05:15,585 --> 00:05:16,837
Got a name?

36
00:05:19,257 --> 00:05:20,299
What?

37
00:05:21,842 --> 00:05:22,842
It's Yuri.

38
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,846
How do you write Yuri?

39
00:05:25,387 --> 00:05:26,429
How old?

40
00:05:29,683 --> 00:05:30,725
Pre-school.

41
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,437
- She's so frail.
- Your nail's flying.

42
00:05:33,688 --> 00:05:36,315
After you've fed her,
take her home.

43
00:05:36,524 --> 00:05:40,486
It's so cold out.
I'll take her home tomorrow.

44
00:05:40,695 --> 00:05:43,948
No, we're not a foster home.

45
00:05:44,157 --> 00:05:47,368
But look, we've got our very own
guardian angel here.

46
00:05:47,702 --> 00:05:49,287
Don't point your chopsticks.

47
00:05:49,495 --> 00:05:50,663
Ping!

48
00:05:53,582 --> 00:05:55,667
That's disgusting, Grandma!

49
00:05:55,876 --> 00:05:57,586
Your spit's flying everywhere.

50
00:05:58,087 --> 00:06:01,799
I told you not to throw your
nails in the entryway.

51
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:03,551
Eat another one?

52
00:06:04,051 --> 00:06:07,053
You live off my pension
but you're so unreliable.

53
00:06:07,304 --> 00:06:08,346
Shut up.

54
00:06:11,558 --> 00:06:13,936
You're so skinny.

55
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,188
Let's have a look at your arm.

56
00:06:17,356 --> 00:06:18,815
What happened here?

57
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:20,358
I fell.

58
00:06:21,736 --> 00:06:22,779
Does it hurt?

59
00:06:24,738 --> 00:06:26,364
Let's have a better look at you.

60
00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:31,119
You're covered in scars.

61
00:06:39,044 --> 00:06:40,879
Take her home
before the cops get here.

62
00:06:41,087 --> 00:06:44,592
She's right, can't get involved.

63
00:06:46,051 --> 00:06:47,886
Grandma,
your noodles will get cold.

64
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:55,561
- Straight?
- No, right, right.

65
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:57,103
Here.

66
00:06:59,565 --> 00:07:00,733
Hey, hey.

67
00:07:01,234 --> 00:07:02,318
Is she asleep?

68
00:07:02,984 --> 00:07:05,904
She got a good deal.
She ate three croquettes.

69
00:07:07,364 --> 00:07:08,448
Ring the bell?

70
00:07:08,657 --> 00:07:11,827
No, no,
put her down by the door.

71
00:07:12,286 --> 00:07:14,372
She'll freeze to death.

72
00:07:14,996 --> 00:07:16,998
In that case...

73
00:07:18,542 --> 00:07:22,462
Put her down,
ring the bell and run?

74
00:07:22,712 --> 00:07:24,089
Like Santa Claus?

75
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,222
That's what you always say!
You're never here!

76
00:07:33,015 --> 00:07:34,976
- I told you.
- I'm the one looking after her!

77
00:07:35,142 --> 00:07:36,393
I'll go take a look.

78
00:07:37,102 --> 00:07:38,603
You get her?

79
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:43,901
Hell knows
who the real father is.

80
00:07:46,736 --> 00:07:48,864
- Don't!
- Shut up!

81
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:52,159
That hurts! Why?

82
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:55,246
I didn't want to
have her either!

83
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,748
Now's our chance.

84
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,460
Hey.

85
00:08:21,938 --> 00:08:22,938
It's cold.

86
00:08:23,858 --> 00:08:25,067
So cold.

87
00:08:26,736 --> 00:08:29,363
She wet the bed.

88
00:08:32,575 --> 00:08:33,700
Stinks.

89
00:08:39,664 --> 00:08:41,125
Say you're sorry.

90
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,751
I'm sorry.

91
00:08:43,502 --> 00:08:44,961
I'm sorry.

92
00:08:45,587 --> 00:08:46,923
I'm sorry.

93
00:08:47,173 --> 00:08:49,091
That's enough.
Shhh, be quiet.

94
00:08:49,674 --> 00:08:51,718
We should have
taken her home last night.

95
00:08:51,968 --> 00:08:53,094
Maybe.

96
00:08:53,513 --> 00:08:55,807
Hey, those are mine.

97
00:08:56,015 --> 00:08:58,016
But they don't fit you anymore.

98
00:08:58,683 --> 00:09:00,852
- Where's my belt?
- OK, raise both arms.

99
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:06,192
It's so cold today,
I should take the day off.

100
00:09:07,025 --> 00:09:08,986
Send an email saying
I caught a cold.

101
00:09:09,986 --> 00:09:11,238
Here's your belt.

102
00:09:16,327 --> 00:09:17,327
He's going out.

103
00:09:17,495 --> 00:09:20,331
I'm just pouring it now.

104
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:21,790
Wait a minute.

105
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:23,960
Oh, throw that out.

106
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:26,712
Here you are, here.

107
00:09:30,842 --> 00:09:31,884
Ouch!

108
00:09:40,058 --> 00:09:41,101
Your nail, bad luck.

109
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:42,436
Oh, my nail.

110
00:10:08,962 --> 00:10:10,046
It's all garbage.

111
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:17,472
Another one ran away.

112
00:10:18,972 --> 00:10:20,474
It was Koga.

113
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,229
No, he sent an email
saying, "I quit."

114
00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:30,777
He was useless anyway.

115
00:10:31,693 --> 00:10:33,487
When I see him,
I'll beat him up.

116
00:11:31,337 --> 00:11:32,712
Show me your arm.

117
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,014
Many scars.

118
00:11:42,682 --> 00:11:45,893
The pain went away,
went away already.

119
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:48,229
Now, the other side.

120
00:11:49,271 --> 00:11:50,355
Hello!

121
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:53,733
I'm Yoneyama,
here to check up on you!

122
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,193
Coming.

123
00:11:55,403 --> 00:11:56,529
Hatsue, are you there?

124
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:58,405
Hey, this girl...

125
00:11:59,406 --> 00:12:00,406
Coming!

126
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:05,703
Coming.

127
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,586
Oh, hello there, I'm Yoneyama.

128
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:20,553
The other side.

129
00:12:20,803 --> 00:12:22,304
This way? Sure.

130
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:30,062
Hello, excuse me.

131
00:12:49,207 --> 00:12:51,125
Your neighbor Kaneko...

132
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,004
finally moved into an apartment.

133
00:12:56,547 --> 00:12:59,217
Even though she had
three grown kids.

134
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:03,929
So that's why I haven't seen her
around recently.

135
00:13:05,222 --> 00:13:08,517
Hatsue, you should talk things
over with your son.

136
00:13:09,976 --> 00:13:11,395
Does he live in Hakata?

137
00:13:11,645 --> 00:13:14,314
Did some real estate agent
send you here?

138
00:13:14,481 --> 00:13:15,775
No, no.

139
00:13:17,443 --> 00:13:19,654
I know how hard it is...

140
00:13:20,154 --> 00:13:22,532
for an old person to live alone.

141
00:13:24,366 --> 00:13:28,371
How much money are you making
to move me out of here?

142
00:13:31,874 --> 00:13:34,168
That's all in the past.

143
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:36,294
I don't flip properties anymore.

144
00:14:08,285 --> 00:14:12,247
Only kids who can't study
at home go to school.

145
00:14:14,207 --> 00:14:21,131
YAMATOYA

146
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,770
Hey, mister.

147
00:14:38,024 --> 00:14:39,275
I need a pack of cigarettes.

148
00:14:41,526 --> 00:14:44,070
- It's getting so cold.
- It's cold.

149
00:14:44,697 --> 00:14:45,823
I want Wakaba.

150
00:14:50,035 --> 00:14:51,369
320 yen.

151
00:15:23,861 --> 00:15:26,279
The baby doesn't look like
either of them.

152
00:15:27,073 --> 00:15:28,241
Plastic surgery?

153
00:15:28,908 --> 00:15:30,534
The father could be anyone.

154
00:15:30,784 --> 00:15:32,495
She used to be a call girl.

155
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:34,204
But she's hiding it,

156
00:15:34,996 --> 00:15:38,458
- pretending she's lousy in bed.
- Amazing.

157
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,837
This is for helping me out
this morning.

158
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,674
You don't have to,
we help each other.

159
00:15:44,881 --> 00:15:47,092
- I'd like a drink, too.
- I'd like a hot lemon.

160
00:15:47,802 --> 00:15:49,387
I'm not treating you guys.

161
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,099
What was it? A fever?

162
00:15:54,308 --> 00:15:57,770
Mumps, from the other kids
at pre-school.

163
00:16:02,942 --> 00:16:04,902
Do you have mumps, too?

164
00:16:05,111 --> 00:16:08,614
Hey, I don't have mumps.

165
00:16:09,823 --> 00:16:12,409
I'll catch it, too.

166
00:16:12,617 --> 00:16:13,617
Oh, no.

167
00:16:13,785 --> 00:16:15,829
- Hey, you already...
- Caught it?

168
00:16:15,954 --> 00:16:17,080
I caught it?

169
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,575
I'm home.

170
00:16:59,081 --> 00:17:02,000
Hey, Shota.

171
00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:22,062
How did you get hurt?

172
00:17:23,397 --> 00:17:24,524
I fell.

173
00:17:25,983 --> 00:17:27,193
You got burned.

174
00:17:30,028 --> 00:17:31,488
Who did it to you?

175
00:17:34,242 --> 00:17:35,243
Your mom?

176
00:17:36,994 --> 00:17:38,454
My mom is nice.

177
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:40,872
She buys me clothes, too.

178
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:45,044
Then what were you
doing outside?

179
00:18:02,562 --> 00:18:03,688
What will you do?

180
00:18:05,273 --> 00:18:06,399
Go back to your home?

181
00:18:23,123 --> 00:18:24,541
I took the shampoo.

182
00:18:25,751 --> 00:18:27,253
Merit Shampoo.

183
00:18:27,879 --> 00:18:30,423
- Yamatoya only has Merit.
- Merit smells bad...

184
00:18:30,547 --> 00:18:32,757
Don't be so picky.

185
00:18:34,593 --> 00:18:38,472
Hey, it looks like
we kidnapped her.

186
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:40,682
No, it doesn't.

187
00:18:41,391 --> 00:18:44,603
We're not confining her and we
haven't asked for a ransom.

188
00:18:44,978 --> 00:18:45,978
That's not the point.

189
00:18:46,147 --> 00:18:49,900
They haven't reported her
missing to the police?

190
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:53,487
I bet they're relieved
she's gone.

191
00:18:55,113 --> 00:18:56,990
It's all Chinese cabbage.

192
00:18:57,992 --> 00:18:59,994
Chinese cabbage is good for you.

193
00:19:00,495 --> 00:19:02,330
It absorbs the meat broth.

194
00:19:03,497 --> 00:19:05,332
The gluten cake is cooked.

195
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,543
What? Gluten cake?

196
00:19:09,253 --> 00:19:10,253
Look.

197
00:19:14,717 --> 00:19:15,884
You like gluten cake?

198
00:19:17,011 --> 00:19:18,221
Come over here.

199
00:19:26,728 --> 00:19:27,728
It's hot.

200
00:19:35,112 --> 00:19:36,279
Is that tasty?

201
00:19:38,365 --> 00:19:39,783
Have you eaten it before?

202
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,410
With whom?

203
00:19:45,456 --> 00:19:46,541
Grandma.

204
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,586
There's more.

205
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:55,132
If you feed her too much,
she'll wet the bed again.

206
00:19:55,466 --> 00:19:58,718
She can sleep in my bed.

207
00:19:58,969 --> 00:20:00,720
No, I sleep with Grandma.

208
00:20:02,974 --> 00:20:04,266
This...

209
00:20:06,351 --> 00:20:07,227
What?

210
00:20:07,352 --> 00:20:08,813
Hold out your hand.

211
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:10,188
Salt?

212
00:20:10,857 --> 00:20:14,318
This keeps you from
wetting the bed.

213
00:20:14,861 --> 00:20:17,280
Go ahead, lick it.

214
00:20:18,573 --> 00:20:19,907
It's salty.

215
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:24,661
She licked it, licked it.
That's how we used to cure it.

216
00:20:25,787 --> 00:20:27,122
Sounds fishy to me.

217
00:20:27,582 --> 00:20:29,292
- I swear it's true.
- She's licking it.

218
00:20:34,213 --> 00:20:35,505
He's home.

219
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,346
It's cold, Shota.

220
00:20:43,723 --> 00:20:45,640
- It's cold.
- It's cold.

221
00:20:46,391 --> 00:20:48,351
Hey, please close it.

222
00:20:48,602 --> 00:20:49,937
This is fine, here.

223
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,148
He's hurt!

224
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:55,192
On crutches!

225
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,236
Is he drunk?

226
00:20:58,946 --> 00:21:00,531
I'm fine now.
I'm all good, no, no.

227
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:04,951
Shota, you made such a mess.

228
00:21:05,535 --> 00:21:07,205
Make some tea.

229
00:21:07,412 --> 00:21:09,332
This room is fine.

230
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,209
Her nail was a bad omen,

231
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:14,544
but you forced me to go to work.

232
00:21:15,463 --> 00:21:19,008
What is this? You can't work
for about a month?

233
00:21:19,217 --> 00:21:21,259
Even day laborers get
workers' compensation, right?

234
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:23,261
- Well, probably...
- Really?

235
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,513
Really?

236
00:21:24,721 --> 00:21:26,848
So, it would be better
if you broke it,

237
00:21:27,015 --> 00:21:28,308
rather than cracked it?

238
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,104
Stop joking around. I thought
I was going to die, ouch!

239
00:21:32,354 --> 00:21:33,939
You get compensation?

240
00:21:38,111 --> 00:21:39,111
Oh, thank you.

241
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,864
She's cute.

242
00:21:42,073 --> 00:21:43,698
- Grandma?
- The other one.

243
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,076
- My wife's sister.
- Different mothers.

244
00:21:47,661 --> 00:21:49,037
So, you have a family.

245
00:21:49,663 --> 00:21:51,331
I thought you were single.

246
00:21:51,582 --> 00:21:52,833
I hear that a lot.

247
00:22:14,647 --> 00:22:16,189
I'll teach you how, someday.

248
00:22:24,364 --> 00:22:26,284
This is your favorite,
gluten cake.

249
00:22:30,537 --> 00:22:31,913
Was your grandma nice?

250
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,544
Did you live with her?

251
00:22:40,172 --> 00:22:41,840
Now she's in heaven.

252
00:22:46,595 --> 00:22:49,055
Then forget about her.

253
00:22:55,771 --> 00:22:57,190
Sorry to keep you waiting.

254
00:22:57,899 --> 00:22:59,065
Thank you so much.

255
00:23:02,152 --> 00:23:05,405
Enter your code now.

256
00:23:06,114 --> 00:23:09,367
1192, everybody knows
the year of the Kamakura regime.

257
00:23:10,578 --> 00:23:12,038
Just say it in your head.

258
00:23:12,412 --> 00:23:13,705
I am.

259
00:23:13,915 --> 00:23:16,542
No, you're not.
No one else should find out.

260
00:23:23,131 --> 00:23:25,217
What does MVK stand for?

261
00:23:25,426 --> 00:23:26,886
Male virgin killer.

262
00:23:27,594 --> 00:23:28,970
What exactly do you do?

263
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:30,680
Well...

264
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:35,477
You wear a knit dress that
shows your sideboob a little.

265
00:23:39,398 --> 00:23:40,690
Sideboob.

266
00:23:41,066 --> 00:23:43,068
That's what's popular now?

267
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,825
It's 3,000 yen. The shop
and the girl split it 50-50.

268
00:23:50,409 --> 00:23:53,579
How great you can get paid
just for that.

269
00:23:54,663 --> 00:23:56,039
You're getting paid, too.

270
00:23:56,873 --> 00:23:59,584
I get paid for damages.

271
00:24:00,628 --> 00:24:02,088
- Damages?
- Right.

272
00:24:03,089 --> 00:24:04,089
Your pension is?

273
00:24:05,757 --> 00:24:08,177
Right, my pension.

274
00:24:09,219 --> 00:24:10,470
I guess, in a way.

275
00:24:15,184 --> 00:24:16,351
Mr. Four?

276
00:24:16,561 --> 00:24:17,853
- Yeah.
- Yours.

277
00:24:18,062 --> 00:24:19,147
I should go.

278
00:24:20,188 --> 00:24:21,524
Was that your rice cake?

279
00:24:22,608 --> 00:24:25,653
Why do you use Sayaka,
your sister's name?

280
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,655
What do you mean, why?

281
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,700
You're so mean.

282
00:24:34,286 --> 00:24:35,537
Just like who?

283
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,292
Oh, good, good.

284
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:42,836
That's good timing.
Try it again, good.

285
00:24:48,633 --> 00:24:52,179
That's right You've gotten
really good.

286
00:24:53,973 --> 00:24:56,809
Yuri,
you're getting the hang of it.

287
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,065
You're late going to work today.

288
00:25:04,484 --> 00:25:06,068
It's work-share today.

289
00:25:06,986 --> 00:25:07,986
What is that?

290
00:25:08,653 --> 00:25:12,240
They can't pay us all,
so ten of us start at noon.

291
00:25:14,994 --> 00:25:18,414
So, everybody gets
a little poorer.

292
00:25:18,831 --> 00:25:20,416
Something like that.

293
00:25:20,582 --> 00:25:22,125
I'm not finished yet.

294
00:25:29,926 --> 00:25:33,888
But no workers' compensation
is a real drag.

295
00:25:35,264 --> 00:25:38,266
A real drag. What a waste,
being so nice to you.

296
00:25:40,977 --> 00:25:42,938
Do you think that guy was OK?

297
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,025
He doesn't care about us.

298
00:25:48,194 --> 00:25:50,530
He sure was good looking.

299
00:25:50,737 --> 00:25:53,073
Hey, what's this?

300
00:25:55,284 --> 00:25:57,495
A tie pin.

301
00:25:59,287 --> 00:26:00,288
It's yours.

302
00:26:01,207 --> 00:26:02,416
But it's fake.

303
00:26:12,134 --> 00:26:13,385
Is he full-time?

304
00:26:14,553 --> 00:26:15,554
Yeah.

305
00:26:17,681 --> 00:26:19,182
So lucky to be full-time.

306
00:26:19,307 --> 00:26:20,307
Want it?

307
00:26:20,517 --> 00:26:21,518
Yes.

308
00:26:22,562 --> 00:26:23,771
You can't have it.

309
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,111
Granny's pension is 70,000 yen
a month, right?

310
00:26:32,112 --> 00:26:33,280
60,000 yen.

311
00:26:34,739 --> 00:26:35,866
But lucky her,

312
00:26:35,992 --> 00:26:38,244
she gets that 'til she dies,
because of her husband.

313
00:26:38,703 --> 00:26:43,124
She talks big, like she's
actually earning that money.

314
00:26:44,124 --> 00:26:45,500
We take care of her.

315
00:26:50,422 --> 00:26:52,048
It's so damn cold.

316
00:26:52,925 --> 00:26:53,926
Welcome home.

317
00:26:54,051 --> 00:26:55,136
I'm home.

318
00:26:56,012 --> 00:26:57,096
Welcome home, Grandma.

319
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:00,223
The pond at the shrine was
frozen over.

320
00:27:00,432 --> 00:27:03,602
We can't have you slipping
and breaking your hip.

321
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:05,103
Where's Aki?

322
00:27:05,313 --> 00:27:07,607
She went to go
shake her breasts.

323
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,400
- What's this?
- Sweet bean jelly.

324
00:27:14,906 --> 00:27:16,198
You're heading out?

325
00:27:17,283 --> 00:27:19,952
Hey, it's cold, you should
wear another layer.

326
00:27:20,495 --> 00:27:22,580
Look after Yuri, Grandma.

327
00:27:22,871 --> 00:27:23,871
Yes, yes.

328
00:27:24,957 --> 00:27:28,377
Go ahead and fix up
whatever there is to eat.

329
00:27:32,547 --> 00:27:33,715
Until the morning?

330
00:27:33,966 --> 00:27:36,968
- I was up hostessing all night.
- Go to sleep.

331
00:27:37,178 --> 00:27:39,304
- Ayu.
- Yes.

332
00:27:39,429 --> 00:27:41,724
You're booked
for the chat room at 3:30.

333
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,351
Yay!

334
00:27:46,144 --> 00:27:48,647
- You're raking it in.
- I have to save money.

335
00:27:48,814 --> 00:27:50,315
- Sayaka.
- Yes.

336
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:54,195
A customer complained
you wear double panties.

337
00:27:54,361 --> 00:27:56,404
Take one off.

338
00:27:56,823 --> 00:27:58,282
You think you're
too good for this.

339
00:27:58,448 --> 00:27:59,574
No, I just get cold.

340
00:27:59,699 --> 00:28:01,244
- Harumi.
- Me?

341
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,121
No fingers in underwear here,
so watch it.

342
00:28:04,287 --> 00:28:05,914
You could shut us all down.

343
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,042
- Right.
- Thanks.

344
00:28:08,668 --> 00:28:10,544
You take this too seriously.

345
00:28:10,753 --> 00:28:12,213
Shut up.

346
00:28:21,721 --> 00:28:23,849
- You're up, Sayaka.
- Right.

347
00:28:32,733 --> 00:28:33,900
Hello.

348
00:28:35,194 --> 00:28:36,904
Is today your day off?

349
00:28:47,122 --> 00:28:48,874
I DIDN'T GO TO WORK TODAY.

350
00:28:49,082 --> 00:28:51,334
I played hooky today, too.

351
00:28:55,005 --> 00:28:59,092
Mr. Four, you're a breast man,
not a butt man, right?

352
00:29:09,937 --> 00:29:11,438
BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE.

353
00:29:11,563 --> 00:29:12,563
OK.

354
00:29:13,608 --> 00:29:15,943
I'll start now.

355
00:30:04,992 --> 00:30:06,869
- Break time.
- Right.

356
00:30:16,586 --> 00:30:17,712
Excuse me.

357
00:30:19,756 --> 00:30:22,802
I'd like to catch a sea bass.

358
00:30:23,177 --> 00:30:26,139
What's the difference between
a plug and a pencil popper?

359
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:28,558
I'll show you
the pencil poppers.

360
00:30:30,476 --> 00:30:31,787
There are so many,
it's confusing.

361
00:30:31,811 --> 00:30:32,853
Happy to help.

362
00:30:33,521 --> 00:30:36,649
A plug is the generic name
for plastic fishing lures.

363
00:31:12,392 --> 00:31:14,562
That worked out great, right?

364
00:31:15,813 --> 00:31:17,564
Yuri, you did a great job, too!

365
00:31:18,315 --> 00:31:19,400
Yay!

366
00:31:21,444 --> 00:31:22,653
In those situations,

367
00:31:23,487 --> 00:31:28,534
the trick is not to panic and
wait for a clerk to go on break.

368
00:31:29,826 --> 00:31:31,203
We don't need her help.

369
00:31:32,955 --> 00:31:36,167
This is what you
call work-share.

370
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:37,876
What's that?

371
00:31:39,629 --> 00:31:42,089
It means what it sounds like,

372
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:44,382
we all share the work.

373
00:31:45,342 --> 00:31:46,593
She's in the way.

374
00:31:46,928 --> 00:31:49,179
Don't say that,
she's your sister.

375
00:31:49,514 --> 00:31:50,848
She's not my sister.

376
00:31:51,556 --> 00:31:54,726
She's your sister.
Yuri is your sister!

377
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,400
You're his sister, right?

378
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:06,656
It's no big deal.

379
00:32:11,369 --> 00:32:13,121
He doesn't mean it.

380
00:32:14,287 --> 00:32:15,747
He's just rebelling now.

381
00:32:21,879 --> 00:32:23,589
How much can you get for those?

382
00:32:24,966 --> 00:32:26,883
About 40,000 to 50,000 yen.

383
00:32:28,969 --> 00:32:33,390
With these, I won't have
to work anymore this month.

384
00:32:33,682 --> 00:32:35,892
Hey Aki,

385
00:32:36,435 --> 00:32:39,522
you should contribute, too.
You're making money, right?

386
00:32:39,647 --> 00:32:43,734
She doesn't have to.
That's the deal we made, right?

387
00:32:44,694 --> 00:32:47,738
She gets her big ideas
because you always spoil her.

388
00:32:48,531 --> 00:32:50,283
You're the one
with the big ideas.

389
00:32:50,408 --> 00:32:52,118
You're preying on her pension.

390
00:32:52,368 --> 00:32:54,287
"Preying" is not a nice word.

391
00:32:54,786 --> 00:32:56,872
Try preying on me if you can.

392
00:32:57,665 --> 00:32:59,167
No one can prey on her.

393
00:32:59,749 --> 00:33:03,044
Oh, I got myself
an insurance plan.

394
00:33:04,255 --> 00:33:08,258
Because I don't want
a lonely death.

395
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:13,597
What do you call
that kind of insurance?

396
00:33:17,101 --> 00:33:20,313
- You're so warm, Grandma.
- Watch out.

397
00:33:20,521 --> 00:33:22,899
I'm mending with a needle,
watch out.

398
00:33:23,064 --> 00:33:24,441
Whose clothes?

399
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,526
That girl, the little girl's.

400
00:33:31,364 --> 00:33:34,159
Did something bad happen?

401
00:33:35,244 --> 00:33:36,245
Why?

402
00:33:36,621 --> 00:33:38,915
Your feet are colder than usual.

403
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:42,710
You know everything,
don't you, Grandma?

404
00:33:43,669 --> 00:33:46,464
You're lucky to have
such a pretty nose.

405
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:49,342
You think so?
I don't like it very much.

406
00:33:50,551 --> 00:33:51,928
Don't stare at me.

407
00:33:55,473 --> 00:33:57,683
Yuri! Lick salt
before you go to bed!

408
00:33:58,226 --> 00:33:59,435
She's right there.

409
00:34:00,143 --> 00:34:01,478
What? Why?

410
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,108
What's going on? You must be
cold, sitting out here.

411
00:34:09,111 --> 00:34:10,362
Will he come home?

412
00:34:13,365 --> 00:34:15,034
You're worried about Shota?

413
00:34:23,626 --> 00:34:25,211
It's not your fault, Yuri.

414
00:34:34,887 --> 00:34:39,267
How about the name "No lonely
death" for the insurance plan?

415
00:34:45,939 --> 00:34:48,650
Even though she's being
abused by her parents...

416
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,488
You mean Yuri?

417
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:57,451
She should be more worried about
her own troubles.

418
00:34:58,494 --> 00:35:01,581
With a mother who wishes
she hadn't given birth to you,

419
00:35:03,999 --> 00:35:05,834
usually,
you'd turn out more like us.

420
00:35:10,715 --> 00:35:11,716
You're right.

421
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,970
You don't grow up
to care about others.

422
00:35:19,055 --> 00:35:21,016
You're right.

423
00:35:35,572 --> 00:35:36,698
Here you are.

424
00:35:42,789 --> 00:35:43,872
I figured.

425
00:35:46,501 --> 00:35:47,501
Ouch.

426
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:49,003
It's so cold.

427
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:53,006
Yuri's so worried,

428
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:55,842
she's been waiting for you
by the door the whole time.

429
00:35:58,428 --> 00:36:00,305
You don't like Yuri?

430
00:36:02,182 --> 00:36:03,434
So, what's wrong?

431
00:36:05,644 --> 00:36:07,521
It's more fun with just us guys.

432
00:36:08,104 --> 00:36:09,606
Of course, it is.

433
00:36:11,108 --> 00:36:12,192
But for Yuri,

434
00:36:12,318 --> 00:36:14,111
if she helps us out,

435
00:36:15,113 --> 00:36:16,906
it's easier to live with us.

436
00:36:18,698 --> 00:36:19,825
Right?

437
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:23,702
Got it?

438
00:36:24,247 --> 00:36:25,289
Got it.

439
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:29,584
Yuri is your what?

440
00:36:32,213 --> 00:36:33,214
My sister.

441
00:36:33,381 --> 00:36:35,591
That's right, right, right.

442
00:36:35,842 --> 00:36:37,885
In that case, what am I?

443
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,594
I'm your...

444
00:36:41,222 --> 00:36:44,057
Da...

445
00:36:44,267 --> 00:36:46,060
- It's OK.
- Say it, c'mon.

446
00:36:46,184 --> 00:36:48,270
Just try saying it, once.
Go ahead.

447
00:36:48,479 --> 00:36:50,231
I will, someday.

448
00:36:50,439 --> 00:36:52,358
Shoot, not fair.

449
00:36:53,108 --> 00:36:54,526
Oh well.

450
00:36:55,653 --> 00:36:57,405
OK. Someday, then.

451
00:37:02,034 --> 00:37:03,910
Let's go home, it's cold.

452
00:37:17,425 --> 00:37:19,968
Hey, did you
sell the fishing rods?

453
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,804
They are still there.

454
00:37:23,347 --> 00:37:24,599
OK, then.

455
00:37:25,765 --> 00:37:27,642
What, you want to fish?

456
00:37:32,106 --> 00:37:35,066
Do you know what Swimmy is?

457
00:37:38,653 --> 00:37:42,407
Your dad can't speak English.

458
00:37:44,202 --> 00:37:47,287
It's not English.
It's in the Japanese textbook.

459
00:37:50,124 --> 00:37:53,127
Your dad's Japanese
is even worse.

460
00:37:54,503 --> 00:37:58,048
Swimmy is a story about
a bunch of little fish,

461
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,093
that beat up a great big tuna.

462
00:38:02,595 --> 00:38:04,055
Do you know why?

463
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,430
Why?

464
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:10,352
Must be because
tuna tastes good, right?

465
00:38:10,686 --> 00:38:11,813
I don't think so.

466
00:38:12,896 --> 00:38:15,190
We haven't eaten
any tuna recently.

467
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,551
I'm going to eat you all up!

468
00:39:01,653 --> 00:39:03,322
- Hey, hey.
- What?

469
00:39:04,322 --> 00:39:06,700
Did you know
there used to be a pond here?

470
00:39:07,535 --> 00:39:08,578
Yeah.

471
00:39:09,202 --> 00:39:11,788
Apparently, Grandpa used to
keep carp in it.

472
00:39:13,166 --> 00:39:15,376
You couldn't keep carp
in a place like this.

473
00:39:16,043 --> 00:39:17,961
I'm sure that's one of
Grandma's tall tales.

474
00:39:19,338 --> 00:39:23,468
The last time Juri was seen
was February 8th.

475
00:39:24,218 --> 00:39:29,557
A neighbor remembers seeing her
playing alone outside her home.

476
00:39:30,015 --> 00:39:33,561
She has been missing for over
two months, but her parents

477
00:39:33,936 --> 00:39:36,771
never filed a missing persons
report with the police.

478
00:39:36,898 --> 00:39:39,316
Was it really Yuri?

479
00:39:44,155 --> 00:39:47,115
What are you smelling me for.

480
00:39:47,325 --> 00:39:48,325
Hey, don't.

481
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:51,746
Hey, Yuri's on TV.

482
00:39:59,921 --> 00:40:01,756
She was reported missing when

483
00:40:01,923 --> 00:40:04,425
Child Welfare Service
contacted the police.

484
00:40:05,675 --> 00:40:09,179
Why did her parents
tell lie after lie?

485
00:40:09,555 --> 00:40:11,515
Why did they
hide her disappearance

486
00:40:11,682 --> 00:40:12,850
for over two months?

487
00:40:13,601 --> 00:40:15,311
The police are
questioning them

488
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:16,771
as important
material witnesses.

489
00:40:17,021 --> 00:40:20,441
The cops think her parents
killed her.

490
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,905
What? So, her name is Juri,
not Yuri.

491
00:40:30,492 --> 00:40:31,952
This looks bad. Really bad.

492
00:40:32,202 --> 00:40:34,246
It's too late for that now.

493
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:38,626
Hey, Yuri, listen.

494
00:40:41,128 --> 00:40:43,672
Can you find your way home
by yourself?

495
00:40:45,048 --> 00:40:47,802
She can't do that,
it's too late.

496
00:40:48,052 --> 00:40:49,262
What will you do?

497
00:40:50,555 --> 00:40:51,973
Try going home?

498
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:54,976
You'll stay here, right?

499
00:41:03,401 --> 00:41:06,404
How about Hana? I had
wanted to name a girl that.

500
00:41:06,653 --> 00:41:08,113
Hana?

501
00:41:08,613 --> 00:41:10,365
She doesn't look like a Hana.

502
00:41:13,202 --> 00:41:14,412
Let's see.

503
00:41:15,496 --> 00:41:16,831
Lin?

504
00:41:17,081 --> 00:41:18,999
- Do you write it like a bell?
- No.

505
00:41:19,166 --> 00:41:21,710
You know, that other way.

506
00:41:29,177 --> 00:41:30,470
It's short.

507
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,305
All done!

508
00:41:32,762 --> 00:41:34,347
You look cute!

509
00:41:35,182 --> 00:41:37,517
- It's a good disguise.
- You look so cute.

510
00:41:37,727 --> 00:41:39,145
Want to see a mirror?

511
00:41:39,854 --> 00:41:41,189
Looking good.

512
00:41:41,564 --> 00:41:42,940
A real beauty.

513
00:41:43,483 --> 00:41:44,650
Looks good.

514
00:41:48,695 --> 00:41:50,030
Short, isn't it?

515
00:41:51,282 --> 00:41:52,365
What do you think?

516
00:41:54,952 --> 00:41:56,662
- It's cute.
- It's cute.

517
00:41:57,497 --> 00:41:58,539
You're cute.

518
00:41:59,831 --> 00:42:02,167
Your hair's naturally brown.

519
00:42:03,293 --> 00:42:05,170
I'm jealous of your hair.

520
00:42:08,633 --> 00:42:09,717
Say...

521
00:42:12,803 --> 00:42:17,265
I have another name, too.

522
00:42:18,934 --> 00:42:20,018
What is it?

523
00:42:21,771 --> 00:42:22,897
Sayaka.

524
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:30,153
I like Lin better.

525
00:42:35,325 --> 00:42:36,660
I like Lin better, too.

526
00:42:38,912 --> 00:42:39,996
I'm Lin.

527
00:42:42,124 --> 00:42:43,501
Hello, I'm Lin.

528
00:42:44,836 --> 00:42:45,919
Like this.

529
00:43:03,436 --> 00:43:05,564
The man saved you, right?

530
00:43:09,026 --> 00:43:11,111
Do you like Auntie and Grandma?

531
00:43:14,532 --> 00:43:16,534
So, you can stand it?

532
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:19,036
I can.

533
00:43:22,164 --> 00:43:25,543
I was sure
she'd want to go home.

534
00:43:27,336 --> 00:43:30,506
Do you think she... chose us?

535
00:43:31,173 --> 00:43:33,508
Usually, you can't choose
your own parents.

536
00:43:34,177 --> 00:43:37,889
But then, maybe it's stronger
when you choose them yourself.

537
00:43:38,014 --> 00:43:39,014
What is?

538
00:43:39,182 --> 00:43:40,475
What is...

539
00:43:42,184 --> 00:43:43,393
The bond.

540
00:43:44,561 --> 00:43:45,645
The bond.

541
00:43:46,481 --> 00:43:50,610
I chose you, too.

542
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:02,329
- Amazing.
- Right?

543
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:06,334
- Do that again.
- Again?

544
00:44:35,695 --> 00:44:37,864
Shota!

545
00:44:40,034 --> 00:44:42,954
You're so cool, Dad!

546
00:44:43,704 --> 00:44:44,872
Are you a kid?

547
00:44:46,414 --> 00:44:47,499
Shut up.

548
00:44:49,793 --> 00:44:50,793
Tell me.

549
00:44:52,713 --> 00:44:53,840
What?

550
00:44:55,173 --> 00:44:56,967
When do you and Nobuyo...

551
00:44:58,802 --> 00:45:00,053
do it?

552
00:45:04,474 --> 00:45:07,477
We don't need that anymore.

553
00:45:10,189 --> 00:45:11,315
Is that true?

554
00:45:14,901 --> 00:45:15,986
We're...

555
00:45:17,572 --> 00:45:20,532
connected in our hearts,
not down here.

556
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,451
Cut it out.

557
00:45:23,494 --> 00:45:24,537
Sounds fishy.

558
00:45:26,997 --> 00:45:29,124
How do you think
we're connected?

559
00:45:36,298 --> 00:45:37,425
Money.

560
00:45:38,593 --> 00:45:39,719
Normally.

561
00:45:42,889 --> 00:45:44,765
But we're not normal.

562
00:45:52,023 --> 00:45:53,441
You're so cool, Dad!

563
00:45:56,693 --> 00:45:58,153
Just a normal one is fine.

564
00:46:02,073 --> 00:46:04,534
Say, Lin, have you ever been
to a beach?

565
00:46:07,162 --> 00:46:08,497
How about you?

566
00:46:08,956 --> 00:46:11,541
What? Sure, I think so.

567
00:46:12,126 --> 00:46:13,711
You think so.

568
00:46:18,006 --> 00:46:19,342
Coming in.

569
00:46:20,885 --> 00:46:22,637
She looks so cute.

570
00:46:22,887 --> 00:46:24,263
What's this?

571
00:46:24,972 --> 00:46:26,849
Your bag won't fit all that.

572
00:46:27,642 --> 00:46:30,852
Then just wear it out.

573
00:46:31,061 --> 00:46:33,647
Just wear it out.

574
00:46:35,816 --> 00:46:37,110
Which looks better?

575
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,486
She looks so good in yellow.

576
00:46:39,736 --> 00:46:42,155
Her hair is brown.

577
00:46:43,573 --> 00:46:44,950
We'll get this one, then.

578
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:46,327
Great, great.

579
00:46:48,371 --> 00:46:49,454
You don't want it?

580
00:46:50,914 --> 00:46:51,916
Why not?

581
00:46:52,332 --> 00:46:53,709
Won't hit me?

582
00:46:55,418 --> 00:46:57,087
You won't hit me later?

583
00:47:05,053 --> 00:47:06,639
I'm not going to hit you.

584
00:47:08,682 --> 00:47:13,478
Three, four, knock at the door

585
00:47:14,396 --> 00:47:19,317
Five, six, pick up sticks

586
00:47:20,068 --> 00:47:21,195
Time to get out?

587
00:47:39,921 --> 00:47:41,173
What's that?

588
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:43,551
An octopus.

589
00:47:46,387 --> 00:47:47,972
I'm going to catch fish.

590
00:47:48,764 --> 00:47:49,890
Catch a fish?

591
00:47:51,267 --> 00:47:52,435
It looks so real.

592
00:47:57,939 --> 00:47:59,566
What happened to you there?

593
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:05,698
This?
I got burned with a hot iron.

594
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:10,161
Me, too.

595
00:48:15,124 --> 00:48:16,250
We're the same.

596
00:48:25,175 --> 00:48:27,719
It's OK. It's all better.

597
00:48:32,934 --> 00:48:35,644
OK, OK. Thank you.

598
00:48:39,856 --> 00:48:44,277
"He taught them
to swim close together,

599
00:48:44,528 --> 00:48:46,697
each in his own place,

600
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:52,702
and when they had learned to
swim like one giant fish,

601
00:48:53,287 --> 00:48:54,622
he said, 'I'll be the eye.'

602
00:48:54,747 --> 00:48:57,542
And so they swam
in the cool morning water,

603
00:48:57,749 --> 00:49:01,920
and joining together
in the midday sun,

604
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:05,967
they chased the big fish away".

605
00:49:07,175 --> 00:49:09,386
Yay! Great job.

606
00:49:10,178 --> 00:49:12,807
But don't you feel sorry
for the big fish?

607
00:49:13,224 --> 00:49:16,017
That's not true, after all,
he ate all your friends, right?

608
00:49:16,227 --> 00:49:17,645
That's true, but...

609
00:49:38,457 --> 00:49:39,791
Come, sit here.

610
00:49:54,849 --> 00:49:55,932
Let's burn it.

611
00:49:57,809 --> 00:49:58,852
OK?

612
00:50:17,704 --> 00:50:19,414
The reason they hit you...

613
00:50:21,626 --> 00:50:23,628
isn't because you are bad.

614
00:50:27,798 --> 00:50:30,383
If they say they hit you
because they love you,

615
00:50:31,385 --> 00:50:32,512
that is a lie.

616
00:50:34,764 --> 00:50:36,015
If they loved you,

617
00:50:37,767 --> 00:50:39,310
if they really loved you,

618
00:50:41,479 --> 00:50:42,897
this is what you do.

619
00:50:52,405 --> 00:50:53,573
This is what you do.

620
00:51:31,778 --> 00:51:33,613
There's really a bug.

621
00:51:36,117 --> 00:51:37,577
Look, a boat.

622
00:51:39,912 --> 00:51:41,038
Hey!

623
00:51:58,139 --> 00:51:59,390
Brother!

624
00:51:59,807 --> 00:52:00,892
Yes.

625
00:52:02,602 --> 00:52:03,603
What is it?

626
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:10,151
A cicada.

627
00:52:10,568 --> 00:52:11,568
Where?

628
00:52:11,735 --> 00:52:14,029
It hasn't grown up
and come out of its shell yet.

629
00:52:18,075 --> 00:52:19,869
A caterpillar, don't get itchy.

630
00:52:19,994 --> 00:52:21,077
It touched.

631
00:52:25,832 --> 00:52:30,671
Go for it, go for it, go for it!

632
00:53:05,956 --> 00:53:06,998
Hey!

633
00:53:20,012 --> 00:53:21,139
I'll give you these.

634
00:53:27,394 --> 00:53:29,104
Don't make your sister do it.

635
00:53:51,501 --> 00:53:53,211
Are you firing one of us?

636
00:53:54,755 --> 00:53:56,256
Why is it between us?

637
00:53:57,842 --> 00:54:00,760
Well, we're in a real bind too.

638
00:54:02,095 --> 00:54:04,139
If we have to cut back,

639
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:08,518
it has to be one of you
with the higher hourly wages.

640
00:54:11,771 --> 00:54:15,400
Can the two of you
please talk it over?

641
00:54:26,954 --> 00:54:28,664
Why does it have to be me?

642
00:54:29,289 --> 00:54:30,832
I said, I'm asking you.

643
00:54:31,459 --> 00:54:34,544
But that's not...
We're both hard up,

644
00:54:34,669 --> 00:54:36,880
it's not just you, you know.

645
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:40,008
If you let me stay,

646
00:54:40,843 --> 00:54:42,053
I'll keep quiet.

647
00:54:43,595 --> 00:54:45,555
You were stealing stuff, too.

648
00:54:46,474 --> 00:54:47,517
Not about that.

649
00:54:49,602 --> 00:54:50,728
The news...

650
00:54:52,771 --> 00:54:54,148
I saw you...

651
00:54:55,066 --> 00:54:57,693
when you were
with that little girl.

652
00:55:13,126 --> 00:55:14,126
OK.

653
00:55:17,963 --> 00:55:19,798
But if you talk,
I will kill you.

654
00:55:39,693 --> 00:55:43,822
How is father's former wife
related to you now?

655
00:55:44,948 --> 00:55:47,702
I know, but I can't help it.

656
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,494
But she keeps visiting.

657
00:55:49,662 --> 00:55:51,581
Don't mind me.

658
00:55:52,289 --> 00:55:55,793
I just stopped by
to honor his memory.

659
00:55:56,126 --> 00:55:57,378
- Yes.
- Yes.

660
00:56:05,343 --> 00:56:07,012
Is everyone doing well?

661
00:56:08,514 --> 00:56:10,599
I haven't seen them
since my father's funeral.

662
00:56:13,394 --> 00:56:15,979
You can't fight blood.

663
00:56:16,146 --> 00:56:18,273
This area is...

664
00:56:29,367 --> 00:56:30,367
Welcome.

665
00:56:30,494 --> 00:56:31,494
I'm off.

666
00:56:31,537 --> 00:56:33,122
Sayaka, dinner tonight?

667
00:56:33,414 --> 00:56:34,999
- What?
- Cabbage rolls tonight.

668
00:56:35,124 --> 00:56:37,543
Yay, I'm in. But with tomato,
not white sauce.

669
00:56:37,793 --> 00:56:39,002
Off you go.

670
00:56:39,503 --> 00:56:41,797
- Save me my slice of cake.
- The Mont Blanc.

671
00:56:41,923 --> 00:56:43,674
- I'm off.
- Off you go.

672
00:56:43,883 --> 00:56:46,511
She's so grown up.

673
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:47,760
Yes.

674
00:56:48,595 --> 00:56:50,472
She's a sophomore.

675
00:56:53,726 --> 00:56:55,602
And your older daughter?

676
00:56:58,939 --> 00:57:00,066
You mean, Aki?

677
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:01,818
Yes.

678
00:57:02,068 --> 00:57:03,401
She's abroad, right?

679
00:57:04,778 --> 00:57:08,615
Yes, she seems to be
enjoying Australia.

680
00:57:10,117 --> 00:57:11,117
Right?

681
00:57:11,369 --> 00:57:14,247
She didn't come home
for summer vacation,

682
00:57:14,412 --> 00:57:16,373
which made her father sad.

683
00:57:16,957 --> 00:57:20,669
Oh, I see, that's wonderful.

684
00:57:26,133 --> 00:57:27,133
Here.

685
00:57:28,302 --> 00:57:29,553
It's not very much, but...

686
00:57:30,345 --> 00:57:32,514
Oh, I see.

687
00:57:33,182 --> 00:57:34,684
Well, in that case, thanks.

688
00:57:34,892 --> 00:57:38,563
I'm very sorry about what
happened with my mother.

689
00:57:39,104 --> 00:57:43,608
Well, it's hardly your fault.

690
00:57:58,582 --> 00:58:00,376
Shoot, only 30,000 yen again.

691
00:58:10,635 --> 00:58:12,179
Thank you so much.

692
00:58:14,682 --> 00:58:16,517
I hope you enjoyed it.

693
00:58:20,354 --> 00:58:21,439
Mr. Four,

694
00:58:23,273 --> 00:58:25,734
let's go to the chat room.

695
00:58:28,361 --> 00:58:30,197
I'd like to see your face, too,

696
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:32,533
Mr. Four.

697
00:58:42,626 --> 00:58:43,919
Great.

698
00:58:46,631 --> 00:58:48,090
What shall we do?

699
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:50,593
Cuddle?

700
00:58:51,552 --> 00:58:53,762
Hug? Sleep on my lap?

701
00:58:58,642 --> 00:59:00,144
My little sister...

702
00:59:01,102 --> 00:59:04,981
Her mother bought her
a bathing suit,

703
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:07,693
and she just loves it.

704
00:59:08,026 --> 00:59:12,072
She wears it around the house,
even when she takes a bath.

705
00:59:13,198 --> 00:59:16,785
And it just reminds me
how I used to do that.

706
00:59:17,577 --> 00:59:19,996
I used to do
the exact same thing.

707
00:59:23,959 --> 00:59:26,670
It's OK to talk to me,
in this room.

708
00:59:29,048 --> 00:59:30,174
I mean...

709
00:59:38,974 --> 00:59:40,308
What happened here?

710
00:59:48,358 --> 00:59:49,693
You hit someone?

711
00:59:52,613 --> 00:59:53,614
Who?

712
00:59:58,535 --> 00:59:59,704
I've...

713
01:00:03,124 --> 01:00:04,876
hit myself, too.

714
01:00:07,461 --> 01:00:10,715
It hurts, doesn't it?

715
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:14,468
It hurts, right?

716
01:00:23,936 --> 01:00:25,229
It's all right.

717
01:00:50,671 --> 01:00:52,048
It's warm together.

718
01:01:07,479 --> 01:01:08,606
Does it hurt?

719
01:01:09,314 --> 01:01:10,441
Yeah.

720
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:15,446
I can feel it's going to rain.

721
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:18,282
Your leg comes in handy.

722
01:01:26,999 --> 01:01:29,334
Cold noodles
hit the spot in summer.

723
01:01:29,709 --> 01:01:30,794
Yup.

724
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:56,236
Why'd you put makeup on?

725
01:01:58,990 --> 01:02:02,325
The department store clerk
recommended it.

726
01:02:07,581 --> 01:02:08,582
This, too.

727
01:02:13,838 --> 01:02:15,173
Hey, how did you afford it?

728
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:17,175
I just got fired.

729
01:02:19,093 --> 01:02:20,344
They found you out?

730
01:02:20,677 --> 01:02:23,597
Something like that.

731
01:02:27,392 --> 01:02:30,938
We could open
another bar, together.

732
01:02:31,271 --> 01:02:32,731
Way downtown.

733
01:02:33,648 --> 01:02:36,067
If we hire Aki,
we might do well.

734
01:02:36,193 --> 01:02:39,070
No, you're still
looking good, you.

735
01:02:39,238 --> 01:02:42,909
If you wear makeup,
like in the old days.

736
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:48,371
Here comes the rain, see?

737
01:02:59,758 --> 01:03:03,637
I'm just so tired.

738
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:17,235
You got this too?

739
01:03:19,486 --> 01:03:20,738
You can tell?

740
01:03:22,782 --> 01:03:25,867
1,980 yen.
Looks more expensive, right?

741
01:03:27,829 --> 01:03:28,871
It looks great.

742
01:04:12,206 --> 01:04:15,126
Hey, hey what, what...

743
01:04:15,793 --> 01:04:17,169
Oh, oh.

744
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,345
Oh, oh.

745
01:04:34,144 --> 01:04:37,481
I can't run any more.

746
01:04:41,903 --> 01:04:44,655
Does this mean
thunder is coming?

747
01:04:47,073 --> 01:04:48,073
Hurry!

748
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:50,494
There'll be thunder, right?

749
01:05:09,597 --> 01:05:11,974
What are you acting cool for?

750
01:05:14,434 --> 01:05:15,686
I did it.

751
01:05:18,271 --> 01:05:20,190
Hey, I did it, right?

752
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:22,193
Yeah, well.

753
01:05:25,905 --> 01:05:28,865
What's with you, looking like
you're not totally satisfied.

754
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:31,785
I hardly broke a sweat.

755
01:05:32,077 --> 01:05:33,621
You're a liar, you.

756
01:05:33,787 --> 01:05:34,871
Gimme.

757
01:05:49,302 --> 01:05:50,302
Another round?

758
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:53,682
No, hey,
how old do you think I am?

759
01:05:54,724 --> 01:05:57,227
Let me bask in the afterglow
a little longer.

760
01:05:57,769 --> 01:06:00,939
Your afterglow is a lot longer.
You're soaked in sweat.

761
01:06:05,653 --> 01:06:07,196
I did it, right?

762
01:06:15,287 --> 01:06:19,583
Hey, look, you've got leeks
on your back.

763
01:06:19,749 --> 01:06:20,793
What?

764
01:06:22,003 --> 01:06:23,086
Where?

765
01:06:24,796 --> 01:06:27,090
Where? What?

766
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:33,180
Don't, stop, that tickles.

767
01:06:38,852 --> 01:06:41,981
Tastes salty, the leek.

768
01:06:49,155 --> 01:06:51,115
Oh, they're back.
They're home, home!

769
01:06:53,159 --> 01:06:54,410
We're home!

770
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:57,789
Oh, you got caught in the rain!

771
01:06:58,706 --> 01:07:00,457
We found a cicada grub.

772
01:07:00,666 --> 01:07:02,293
What, a cicada, OK.

773
01:07:02,543 --> 01:07:04,419
I'm soaked.

774
01:07:04,628 --> 01:07:06,130
It just started pouring.

775
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:09,300
That's right, pouring rain.
All right, OK.

776
01:07:09,883 --> 01:07:11,135
Pouring rain!

777
01:07:11,385 --> 01:07:13,095
What were you doing?

778
01:07:13,345 --> 01:07:15,472
Look, it's raining, raining.

779
01:07:15,847 --> 01:07:17,015
It poured.

780
01:07:17,390 --> 01:07:20,811
Take your cicada and
go take a bath, a bath, go!

781
01:07:22,354 --> 01:07:25,858
Make a hole in the center,
and let's...

782
01:07:26,191 --> 01:07:29,111
put it in there, young lady.

783
01:07:29,361 --> 01:07:33,115
Here goes, yes, watch carefully.

784
01:07:35,325 --> 01:07:37,160
How many kids?

785
01:07:37,702 --> 01:07:38,829
- Three.
- Three?

786
01:07:39,037 --> 01:07:42,624
The daughter-in-law
sweet talked her son,

787
01:07:43,166 --> 01:07:45,001
and they moved out.

788
01:07:46,419 --> 01:07:49,131
Oh, yeah. That happens a lot.

789
01:07:49,381 --> 01:07:50,675
I'm home.

790
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,468
Welcome home.

791
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:56,139
- Did you get rained on?
- I was fine.

792
01:07:59,267 --> 01:08:01,352
- What?
- Did something good happen?

793
01:08:03,186 --> 01:08:05,438
I'll tell you soon, Grandma.

794
01:08:05,689 --> 01:08:06,941
I see.

795
01:08:07,066 --> 01:08:08,443
I see, she says.

796
01:08:08,608 --> 01:08:09,985
Was it a guy?

797
01:08:10,695 --> 01:08:11,778
That's right!

798
01:08:12,613 --> 01:08:14,031
What kind of guy?

799
01:08:14,197 --> 01:08:16,950
Just a regular customer
where I work.

800
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,162
- What?
- He was a customer.

801
01:08:21,621 --> 01:08:23,707
So, we're the same.

802
01:08:24,082 --> 01:08:25,710
Even if that's the same...

803
01:08:26,085 --> 01:08:28,129
But it's important.

804
01:08:28,629 --> 01:08:29,714
What?

805
01:08:29,921 --> 01:08:30,964
Is he handsome?

806
01:08:32,215 --> 01:08:33,633
Yeah, you could say so.

807
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:34,927
That's different.

808
01:08:35,428 --> 01:08:36,512
It's different.

809
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:38,347
So, what's he like?

810
01:08:39,557 --> 01:08:40,558
The quiet type.

811
01:08:40,765 --> 01:08:44,019
The quiet type is good,
the quiet types are...

812
01:08:44,228 --> 01:08:48,357
Talkative men are no good,
talkative men are bad!

813
01:08:48,482 --> 01:08:49,816
You calling me?

814
01:08:50,026 --> 01:08:51,903
- Not calling you!
- Not calling you!

815
01:08:53,278 --> 01:08:54,988
Here goes, here goes!

816
01:08:55,281 --> 01:08:56,532
Here goes, blow!

817
01:08:57,825 --> 01:08:58,826
It disappeared again!

818
01:08:58,951 --> 01:09:01,746
Look! Look.

819
01:09:01,954 --> 01:09:04,665
- Where'd it go?
- Look, where'd it go?

820
01:09:05,124 --> 01:09:06,435
- Amazing, right?
- It's really gone.

821
01:09:06,459 --> 01:09:07,835
Where was it before?

822
01:09:08,169 --> 01:09:09,420
- Where was it before?
- Here.

823
01:09:09,670 --> 01:09:13,382
Maybe it's here again?
Maybe it's here again, or here?

824
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:14,759
No, no, it's not there.

825
01:09:15,009 --> 01:09:17,428
Where, where, what?
Where, where.

826
01:09:17,553 --> 01:09:19,138
Look, it's gone!

827
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:21,223
What's that?

828
01:09:21,348 --> 01:09:23,601
What are you doing!

829
01:09:25,853 --> 01:09:27,772
Idiot! Cut it out, cut it out.

830
01:09:28,022 --> 01:09:29,482
- That's all?
- No, no, no.

831
01:09:29,607 --> 01:09:31,484
- That's all.
- No!

832
01:09:31,608 --> 01:09:32,735
Ouch!

833
01:09:33,361 --> 01:09:34,946
I had thought it was amazing.

834
01:09:35,153 --> 01:09:36,153
Don't do that.

835
01:09:36,363 --> 01:09:37,447
All right, hey!

836
01:09:37,697 --> 01:09:38,950
I can do some of it, too.

837
01:09:39,116 --> 01:09:41,451
I'll show you a more amazing
trick. You'll be shocked!

838
01:09:41,701 --> 01:09:43,954
- Bring the deck of cards.
- I know that trick.

839
01:09:44,121 --> 01:09:46,832
Don't tell them, you dummy!

840
01:09:46,999 --> 01:09:49,376
Don't get up!
Do that over there.

841
01:09:51,545 --> 01:09:52,629
Find it?

842
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:55,298
- No.
- Below the red one.

843
01:09:56,550 --> 01:09:57,550
Hey.

844
01:09:59,387 --> 01:10:01,304
He said,
"Don't make your sister do it".

845
01:10:01,555 --> 01:10:02,639
Do what?

846
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:04,517
This.

847
01:10:06,352 --> 01:10:07,436
Who did?

848
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:09,563
The Yamatoya guy.

849
01:10:10,731 --> 01:10:12,775
Of course, it's still too early
for Lin to...

850
01:10:14,192 --> 01:10:15,192
Find it?

851
01:10:15,736 --> 01:10:16,737
I can't.

852
01:10:17,905 --> 01:10:21,200
What are you doing?
It shouldn't be hard to find.

853
01:10:44,723 --> 01:10:47,726
You old fart,
you'll catch a cold.

854
01:10:51,022 --> 01:10:52,439
Oh, fireworks.

855
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:54,984
On the Sumida River.

856
01:10:55,942 --> 01:10:58,361
In the old days,
we went every year.

857
01:10:58,862 --> 01:11:01,865
After I got rained on one year,
I stopped going.

858
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:03,743
Rain cancels fireworks.

859
01:11:03,910 --> 01:11:05,244
Can't see them, right?

860
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:07,037
Sounds only.

861
01:11:07,245 --> 01:11:08,245
Can't see them.

862
01:11:08,414 --> 01:11:09,706
It's almost over.

863
01:11:10,791 --> 01:11:12,000
The show's over.

864
01:11:12,876 --> 01:11:14,044
All over?

865
01:11:17,756 --> 01:11:20,884
That huge one.
What's it called? The Peony?

866
01:11:23,804 --> 01:11:26,014
The one that tumbles down
is the Willow.

867
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:33,814
See, look.

868
01:11:34,064 --> 01:11:36,651
- I can't see a thing.
- Can't see, but listen to it.

869
01:12:08,265 --> 01:12:09,265
What else?

870
01:12:09,433 --> 01:12:11,686
A cloud that looks like a fish.

871
01:12:11,893 --> 01:12:12,978
You're right.

872
01:12:14,147 --> 01:12:15,523
Does it look like a whale?

873
01:12:15,731 --> 01:12:17,692
- A fish.
- Is it?

874
01:12:40,464 --> 01:12:43,425
Shota, hurry up and blow it up!

875
01:12:49,139 --> 01:12:51,267
A huge wave!

876
01:12:58,273 --> 01:12:59,608
Amazing.

877
01:13:01,152 --> 01:13:04,739
Shota, you like boobs?

878
01:13:04,988 --> 01:13:05,988
Not especially.

879
01:13:06,198 --> 01:13:07,991
Liar, I saw you looking.

880
01:13:09,285 --> 01:13:10,452
Why?

881
01:13:10,702 --> 01:13:13,455
It's all right.
All men like boobs.

882
01:13:14,999 --> 01:13:16,459
Your Daddy loves them, too.

883
01:13:19,879 --> 01:13:20,921
Tell me.

884
01:13:22,339 --> 01:13:25,592
Are you getting big down there
in the mornings?

885
01:13:25,802 --> 01:13:27,344
Why?

886
01:13:28,387 --> 01:13:29,472
Right?

887
01:13:30,097 --> 01:13:31,139
Everybody does?

888
01:13:31,389 --> 01:13:34,017
Everybody does. All men do.

889
01:13:35,228 --> 01:13:36,479
Feel better?

890
01:13:37,187 --> 01:13:38,772
I thought maybe I was sick.

891
01:13:38,981 --> 01:13:40,023
You're healthy!

892
01:13:41,067 --> 01:13:42,067
Great!

893
01:13:50,535 --> 01:13:51,661
Feels good?

894
01:14:00,044 --> 01:14:01,254
It's cold!

895
01:14:06,384 --> 01:14:07,384
Say...

896
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:09,804
it's just like I said, right?

897
01:14:10,054 --> 01:14:12,473
It's not going to last long.

898
01:14:13,265 --> 01:14:14,808
I know that.

899
01:14:17,519 --> 01:14:21,439
But sometimes, it's better
to choose your own family.

900
01:14:21,857 --> 01:14:25,902
If only not to
have expectations.

901
01:14:26,571 --> 01:14:27,655
Yeah, it is.

902
01:14:31,784 --> 01:14:36,371
Lady, when I look closely,
you're a good-looking woman.

903
01:14:40,293 --> 01:14:41,376
What did you say?

904
01:14:42,085 --> 01:14:43,211
Your face.

905
01:14:49,969 --> 01:14:51,179
I'm off.

906
01:15:05,610 --> 01:15:10,072
Oh, look at all the age spots.

907
01:15:26,171 --> 01:15:31,760
Thank you.

908
01:15:38,308 --> 01:15:40,393
Watch out, Shota!

909
01:15:44,816 --> 01:15:45,816
Watch out!

910
01:15:45,982 --> 01:15:47,692
Hey, those...

911
01:15:50,028 --> 01:15:52,697
That's not a swimsuit,
they're underpants.

912
01:16:36,867 --> 01:16:37,910
What is it?

913
01:16:39,202 --> 01:16:40,705
Don't open it suddenly.

914
01:16:41,914 --> 01:16:43,499
My tooth came out.

915
01:16:43,749 --> 01:16:44,791
Your tooth?

916
01:17:02,268 --> 01:17:05,980
You say, "Please grow a strong
tooth" and then you throw it.

917
01:17:07,732 --> 01:17:10,359
Say, "Grow back in,"
and throw it.

918
01:17:12,737 --> 01:17:14,071
Grandma.

919
01:17:17,282 --> 01:17:18,534
Wake up.

920
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:21,120
Wake up.

921
01:17:23,289 --> 01:17:24,706
Wake up.

922
01:17:27,293 --> 01:17:28,878
C'mon, wake up.

923
01:17:33,049 --> 01:17:34,342
Hey, Grandma.

924
01:17:35,134 --> 01:17:36,219
Grandma!

925
01:17:37,219 --> 01:17:38,387
Oh, no, Aki!

926
01:17:38,679 --> 01:17:40,389
Get me the phone!

927
01:17:42,767 --> 01:17:44,018
Move.

928
01:17:47,479 --> 01:17:49,689
- What the hell!
- She's dead.

929
01:17:50,775 --> 01:17:52,902
Look at her, she's not
coming back to life.

930
01:17:55,987 --> 01:17:57,740
We can't call an ambulance here.

931
01:18:05,289 --> 01:18:06,706
There's nothing we can do.

932
01:18:07,375 --> 01:18:09,544
We each get our turn.

933
01:18:15,674 --> 01:18:18,593
What about a funeral?
Or cremation?

934
01:18:18,803 --> 01:18:20,720
We don't have money for that.

935
01:18:21,097 --> 01:18:22,223
But, you...

936
01:18:25,308 --> 01:18:27,227
Let's just stay by her side
a little longer.

937
01:18:28,603 --> 01:18:31,523
She gets lonely too, right?

938
01:18:39,115 --> 01:18:41,117
What? No, you...

939
01:18:41,701 --> 01:18:43,578
Lin, you...

940
01:18:44,327 --> 01:18:47,330
You don't want to say goodbye
to Grandma, do you?

941
01:18:47,581 --> 01:18:48,581
No.

942
01:19:34,045 --> 01:19:37,006
Listen, this is a big secret.

943
01:19:38,715 --> 01:19:40,718
Grandma was never here.

944
01:19:41,344 --> 01:19:43,137
It's been always
five in our family.

945
01:19:44,554 --> 01:19:45,554
Got it?

946
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:47,933
Yeah.

947
01:20:15,378 --> 01:20:17,546
I can't believe
we're burying another one.

948
01:20:19,048 --> 01:20:22,218
But this is really different
from that time.

949
01:20:24,219 --> 01:20:25,387
You're right.

950
01:20:27,557 --> 01:20:30,518
Depending on
how you think about,

951
01:20:32,603 --> 01:20:33,855
Grandma must be happy.

952
01:20:34,522 --> 01:20:36,149
Of course she is.

953
01:20:36,566 --> 01:20:38,818
So much better than dying alone.

954
01:20:46,616 --> 01:20:47,909
There's more.

955
01:21:01,174 --> 01:21:02,967
You know, when I die...

956
01:21:03,342 --> 01:21:05,303
What?

957
01:21:10,558 --> 01:21:12,602
Bury me under the pond
in the yard.

958
01:21:18,566 --> 01:21:21,068
That pond isn't big enough.

959
01:21:22,652 --> 01:21:23,862
You're right.

960
01:21:33,289 --> 01:21:36,125
Wait, you always walk out wet.
Wipe your feet.

961
01:21:36,334 --> 01:21:37,543
I know that.

962
01:22:06,571 --> 01:22:07,781
How much?

963
01:22:08,406 --> 01:22:10,325
116,000 yen.

964
01:22:11,827 --> 01:22:13,036
Whose money?

965
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:15,163
It's Grandma's money.

966
01:22:16,832 --> 01:22:18,084
So, it's not bad.

967
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:19,835
It's not bad.

968
01:22:22,921 --> 01:22:24,464
What about shoplifting?

969
01:22:26,592 --> 01:22:28,219
What does your father say?

970
01:22:29,512 --> 01:22:33,349
Whatever's in a store
doesn't belong to anyone yet.

971
01:22:41,691 --> 01:22:45,111
Well, as long as the store
doesn't go bankrupt, it's OK.

972
01:22:56,164 --> 01:22:58,749
Hello, young mother, croquettes
for your son?

973
01:23:02,003 --> 01:23:04,130
Do you like being called mother?

974
01:23:05,214 --> 01:23:06,340
By whom?

975
01:23:07,549 --> 01:23:08,633
By Lin.

976
01:23:09,677 --> 01:23:11,429
I won't know until she does.

977
01:23:14,139 --> 01:23:16,517
Why do you ask me that?

978
01:23:17,602 --> 01:23:21,022
Because he wants me
to call him "Dad."

979
01:23:23,064 --> 01:23:24,232
But you can't.

980
01:23:25,192 --> 01:23:26,610
No, not yet.

981
01:23:31,823 --> 01:23:35,452
It's really not a big deal.
So, don't worry about it.

982
01:23:36,995 --> 01:23:38,038
OK.

983
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:50,218
What was that?

984
01:23:52,512 --> 01:23:53,679
You try it.

985
01:24:02,396 --> 01:24:04,314
Grandma's amazing,

986
01:24:04,523 --> 01:24:06,942
she keeps helping us out
even after she's dead.

987
01:24:07,652 --> 01:24:10,613
Well, the really helpful one
is the old man.

988
01:24:15,785 --> 01:24:17,161
What can you see?

989
01:24:18,036 --> 01:24:19,371
What? The ocean.

990
01:24:22,582 --> 01:24:23,793
The universe.

991
01:24:24,585 --> 01:24:25,711
Universe?

992
01:24:26,545 --> 01:24:28,923
Found it! Found it!
I knew she'd stashed some away!

993
01:24:29,131 --> 01:24:30,758
With her dentures.

994
01:24:31,134 --> 01:24:32,260
For real?

995
01:24:32,884 --> 01:24:35,220
There it is, amazing!

996
01:24:39,433 --> 01:24:42,395
It's in there? It is.

997
01:24:42,603 --> 01:24:45,064
- Wow, amazing!
- 10, 11, 12.

998
01:24:45,272 --> 01:24:48,400
13, 14, 15!

999
01:24:50,695 --> 01:24:53,072
Amazing! That's 30,000 yen each.

1000
01:24:53,738 --> 01:24:55,741
Did Grandma have a scam going?

1001
01:24:56,284 --> 01:24:57,451
Money is money.

1002
01:25:12,924 --> 01:25:13,925
Hey.

1003
01:25:14,427 --> 01:25:15,428
What?

1004
01:25:16,470 --> 01:25:18,347
Don't these belong to someone?

1005
01:25:24,853 --> 01:25:25,979
So, what?

1006
01:25:29,525 --> 01:25:30,525
What?

1007
01:25:35,781 --> 01:25:36,781
Hey.

1008
01:25:38,617 --> 01:25:41,704
You want to try this, too?

1009
01:25:42,537 --> 01:25:44,456
Hey, hey!

1010
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:49,503
In that case, hey...

1011
01:25:50,796 --> 01:25:53,340
You be the lookout
by the stairs, OK?

1012
01:26:15,112 --> 01:26:16,738
This is amazing.

1013
01:26:20,951 --> 01:26:22,202
Back when...

1014
01:26:23,912 --> 01:26:25,205
When you saved me...

1015
01:26:25,372 --> 01:26:26,415
What!

1016
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:30,086
Were you trying to steal
something from the car, too?

1017
01:26:31,170 --> 01:26:32,630
No, you dummy.

1018
01:26:33,004 --> 01:26:36,717
That time, I was just trying
to save you.

1019
01:26:41,429 --> 01:26:43,098
Shoot! Hey! Come!

1020
01:27:05,705 --> 01:27:07,747
"In mourning."
What does this mean?

1021
01:27:19,927 --> 01:27:21,094
Day off?

1022
01:27:22,638 --> 01:27:24,055
Did it go bankrupt?

1023
01:27:32,982 --> 01:27:34,442
Welcome!

1024
01:27:35,317 --> 01:27:36,443
You wait here.

1025
01:27:46,495 --> 01:27:47,788
Welcome!

1026
01:28:31,374 --> 01:28:32,375
Hey.

1027
01:28:40,799 --> 01:28:41,799
Hey!

1028
01:28:59,610 --> 01:29:01,112
Hey, you!

1029
01:29:35,604 --> 01:29:36,604
Hey!

1030
01:30:02,964 --> 01:30:05,300
- Shibata Shota.
- Shibata Shota.

1031
01:30:05,802 --> 01:30:07,260
How do you write that?

1032
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:10,110
The standard Shibata,
like the ballplayer.

1033
01:30:10,263 --> 01:30:11,431
Like the ballplayer.

1034
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:14,309
For "Sho,"
the character with sheep

1035
01:30:14,643 --> 01:30:16,771
and for "ta,"
the character for thick.

1036
01:30:16,978 --> 01:30:19,106
- How old is he?
- Oh, wait.

1037
01:30:23,236 --> 01:30:25,738
He broke his leg,
but he didn't hit his head.

1038
01:30:26,446 --> 01:30:28,824
Excuse me,
are you Shota's mother?

1039
01:30:29,491 --> 01:30:30,367
Yes.

1040
01:30:30,492 --> 01:30:32,536
You'll need to come with us
to the police precinct.

1041
01:30:32,661 --> 01:30:34,746
Oh, I just came to get him.

1042
01:30:34,871 --> 01:30:37,082
I left my other child at home.

1043
01:30:37,207 --> 01:30:39,460
We have to get
his insurance card and things.

1044
01:30:39,669 --> 01:30:42,088
- We'll be right back.
- I'm sorry, our other child...

1045
01:30:42,254 --> 01:30:44,756
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1046
01:30:49,137 --> 01:30:50,429
Listen.

1047
01:30:50,638 --> 01:30:52,305
- Give me that.
- No.

1048
01:30:52,807 --> 01:30:54,267
- Why not?
- No!

1049
01:30:55,893 --> 01:30:58,563
OK, that's OK.

1050
01:30:59,229 --> 01:31:02,023
Listen, if they ask your name,
you tell them it's Lin.

1051
01:31:02,316 --> 01:31:03,584
And if they ask you
about Grandma,

1052
01:31:03,608 --> 01:31:04,753
tell them you don't know her.

1053
01:31:04,777 --> 01:31:06,362
What about Brother?

1054
01:31:06,612 --> 01:31:07,989
Shota? We'll go get him later.

1055
01:31:08,196 --> 01:31:11,616
That's right. They'll feed him
at the hospital.

1056
01:31:11,826 --> 01:31:13,327
Let's put Lin's shoes on here.

1057
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:14,787
Don't bother.

1058
01:31:43,816 --> 01:31:46,652
Wow, what a pretty color.

1059
01:31:49,446 --> 01:31:51,364
So, it was a beautiful day.

1060
01:31:51,782 --> 01:31:53,409
Amazing.

1061
01:31:57,705 --> 01:31:58,747
Juri.

1062
01:32:00,415 --> 01:32:02,543
How many of you
went to the beach?

1063
01:32:05,379 --> 01:32:06,506
Five people.

1064
01:32:06,630 --> 01:32:08,089
- Five people.
- Five people.

1065
01:32:09,549 --> 01:32:11,092
What were you doing
at the beach?

1066
01:32:11,510 --> 01:32:12,512
Jumping.

1067
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:13,762
Jumping?

1068
01:32:17,474 --> 01:32:20,393
Was your grandma with you then?

1069
01:32:28,361 --> 01:32:31,572
Where were you living?

1070
01:32:33,741 --> 01:32:34,992
In a car.

1071
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:37,370
In a car?

1072
01:32:38,411 --> 01:32:39,746
All alone?

1073
01:32:40,247 --> 01:32:41,247
Yes.

1074
01:32:45,085 --> 01:32:47,963
Are you covering up for someone?

1075
01:32:52,259 --> 01:32:53,718
When we got to the house,

1076
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:56,680
they were all

1077
01:32:57,598 --> 01:33:01,310
packing their things up
and trying to run away,

1078
01:33:01,936 --> 01:33:03,312
abandoning you.

1079
01:33:05,522 --> 01:33:08,400
A real family would
never treat you like that.

1080
01:33:20,871 --> 01:33:23,081
The man's real name is
Enoki Shota,

1081
01:33:23,624 --> 01:33:25,501
the woman is Tanabe Yuko.

1082
01:33:29,964 --> 01:33:32,008
They had killed someone?

1083
01:33:34,844 --> 01:33:36,137
Her previous husband.

1084
01:33:37,638 --> 01:33:39,557
Stabbed him, killed him
and buried him.

1085
01:33:40,558 --> 01:33:42,226
Tangled up
in a crime of passion.

1086
01:33:46,147 --> 01:33:47,314
That's how those two...

1087
01:33:48,316 --> 01:33:49,817
are connected.

1088
01:33:53,571 --> 01:33:56,157
That was self-defense, right?

1089
01:33:57,407 --> 01:33:59,951
If we hadn't killed him,
he would've killed us both.

1090
01:34:02,245 --> 01:34:04,331
Well, that's how
the judge ruled.

1091
01:34:07,335 --> 01:34:09,879
And what does that
have to do with this situation?

1092
01:34:12,255 --> 01:34:14,717
No, it wasn't a kidnapping.

1093
01:34:15,509 --> 01:34:18,262
She looked like
she was starving,

1094
01:34:18,845 --> 01:34:21,307
so Nobuyo brought her home.

1095
01:34:21,933 --> 01:34:24,268
And the girl was happy
to come with her.

1096
01:34:26,019 --> 01:34:27,229
When was that?

1097
01:34:29,523 --> 01:34:30,775
Last February.

1098
01:34:32,610 --> 01:34:34,737
That's what we call kidnapping.

1099
01:34:35,696 --> 01:34:37,782
That's what I told her too,

1100
01:34:39,032 --> 01:34:40,325
but she said...

1101
01:34:41,076 --> 01:34:44,121
we weren't demanding a ransom,

1102
01:34:44,705 --> 01:34:46,249
so we were protecting her.

1103
01:34:48,375 --> 01:34:51,336
Thank you for coming.

1104
01:34:51,963 --> 01:34:53,464
How is Juri doing?

1105
01:34:54,048 --> 01:34:55,090
Yes.

1106
01:34:55,674 --> 01:34:59,678
I guess she was relieved.
She fell fast asleep.

1107
01:35:00,304 --> 01:35:03,891
Nozomi,
what did Juri eat yesterday?

1108
01:35:05,518 --> 01:35:06,978
Her favorite,
omelet with rice.

1109
01:35:07,186 --> 01:35:08,426
You cooked it
for your daughter?

1110
01:35:09,229 --> 01:35:11,022
Yes, I cooked it.

1111
01:35:22,326 --> 01:35:23,536
That's because...

1112
01:35:24,661 --> 01:35:27,956
Grandma asked me to
move in with her.

1113
01:35:31,919 --> 01:35:35,548
But that wasn't out of kindness.

1114
01:35:40,844 --> 01:35:43,054
She was getting money
from the family

1115
01:35:43,638 --> 01:35:45,599
that stole her husband.

1116
01:35:50,271 --> 01:35:51,354
Money?

1117
01:35:51,938 --> 01:35:53,482
From my parents?

1118
01:35:54,858 --> 01:35:57,195
They paid her
every time she visited.

1119
01:36:00,113 --> 01:36:05,660
What? So, my parents knew
that I was living with her?

1120
01:36:07,037 --> 01:36:09,581
Your parents say
they didn't know, but...

1121
01:36:28,058 --> 01:36:29,309
So, Grandma...

1122
01:36:32,271 --> 01:36:34,398
only wanted their money?

1123
01:36:37,610 --> 01:36:38,820
Not me.

1124
01:36:45,326 --> 01:36:48,412
Where is your grandma now?

1125
01:36:55,670 --> 01:36:59,632
We're outside the house where
Shibata Hatsue was discovered.

1126
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:02,259
Several weeks have passed since
she died,

1127
01:37:02,468 --> 01:37:04,554
and the police
are investigating,

1128
01:37:04,719 --> 01:37:07,013
including the possibility
of murder.

1129
01:37:07,848 --> 01:37:10,976
What the people who
pretended to be her family

1130
01:37:11,184 --> 01:37:15,481
were doing in this house
remains shrouded in mystery.

1131
01:37:19,026 --> 01:37:21,653
So, you say you did it
all by yourself?

1132
01:37:23,488 --> 01:37:24,488
Yes.

1133
01:37:27,951 --> 01:37:30,495
The digging and the burying.

1134
01:37:32,874 --> 01:37:34,125
That's right.

1135
01:37:35,375 --> 01:37:36,793
I did it all myself.

1136
01:37:37,961 --> 01:37:40,589
Corpse disposal carries
a heavy sentence.

1137
01:37:42,049 --> 01:37:43,259
Do you understand?

1138
01:37:45,553 --> 01:37:46,970
I didn't throw her away.

1139
01:37:49,514 --> 01:37:50,640
Yes, you did.

1140
01:37:50,849 --> 01:37:52,184
I didn't throw her away.

1141
01:37:55,979 --> 01:37:57,106
I found her.

1142
01:38:01,568 --> 01:38:03,571
Someone threw her away
and I found her.

1143
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:11,787
It was someone else
who threw her away.

1144
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,502
Didn't you feel guilty

1145
01:38:18,628 --> 01:38:20,254
making children shoplift?

1146
01:38:26,344 --> 01:38:27,428
I...

1147
01:38:29,179 --> 01:38:33,142
don't know anything else
to teach them.

1148
01:38:36,937 --> 01:38:38,355
But still...

1149
01:38:42,442 --> 01:38:46,446
Why did you name the boy Shota?

1150
01:38:49,116 --> 01:38:50,784
That's your real name, right?

1151
01:39:14,142 --> 01:39:15,434
Is it an apartment?

1152
01:39:16,727 --> 01:39:18,271
A two-story house.

1153
01:39:21,982 --> 01:39:25,735
You'll live there
with six other children.

1154
01:39:27,821 --> 01:39:29,573
- Just with other kids?
- Yes.

1155
01:39:31,159 --> 01:39:35,246
You could commute to school
from there, Shota.

1156
01:39:39,666 --> 01:39:42,919
I thought only kids who can't
study at home go to school.

1157
01:39:48,675 --> 01:39:50,010
There are some things

1158
01:39:50,803 --> 01:39:52,555
you can't study at home.

1159
01:39:53,347 --> 01:39:54,389
Like what?

1160
01:39:59,019 --> 01:40:00,437
Meeting people.

1161
01:40:01,813 --> 01:40:03,398
Making new friends.

1162
01:40:05,942 --> 01:40:07,445
How is Lin doing?

1163
01:40:14,494 --> 01:40:16,245
She went back to her family.

1164
01:40:17,037 --> 01:40:18,371
Her real family?

1165
01:40:19,540 --> 01:40:20,666
Yeah.

1166
01:40:26,630 --> 01:40:29,925
Shota, if you, too...

1167
01:40:31,552 --> 01:40:33,970
But I don't remember anything.

1168
01:41:12,009 --> 01:41:13,553
You know, this...

1169
01:41:13,678 --> 01:41:17,932
Listen, I'm busy. Go away.

1170
01:41:22,436 --> 01:41:23,688
That hurts.

1171
01:41:25,481 --> 01:41:27,358
I told you not to touch me.

1172
01:41:28,442 --> 01:41:29,860
Just go away.

1173
01:41:36,032 --> 01:41:37,367
Say you're sorry.

1174
01:41:41,789 --> 01:41:43,499
Say you're sorry.

1175
01:41:55,553 --> 01:41:56,595
Juri...

1176
01:41:58,138 --> 01:42:01,391
I'll buy you new clothes,
so come over here.

1177
01:42:05,729 --> 01:42:07,314
Why not? Come here.

1178
01:42:14,071 --> 01:42:16,365
Lin said she wanted to go back?

1179
01:42:17,157 --> 01:42:19,117
Yes, Juri is her name.

1180
01:42:21,954 --> 01:42:25,207
No, she would never say that.

1181
01:42:28,503 --> 01:42:32,548
Children need their mothers.

1182
01:42:37,844 --> 01:42:40,597
That's just what
mothers imagine.

1183
01:42:47,354 --> 01:42:49,607
Giving birth automatically
makes you a mother?

1184
01:42:53,277 --> 01:42:55,446
You can't become a mother
unless you do.

1185
01:43:00,660 --> 01:43:03,287
I understand it's tough
for you that can't give birth.

1186
01:43:05,372 --> 01:43:06,665
Were you jealous?

1187
01:43:07,707 --> 01:43:09,251
Is that why you kidnapped her?

1188
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:18,093
Maybe.

1189
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:23,014
Maybe I hated her, my mother.

1190
01:43:26,352 --> 01:43:28,104
What did the two children

1191
01:43:29,397 --> 01:43:31,439
call you?

1192
01:43:38,865 --> 01:43:39,991
Mommy?

1193
01:43:41,659 --> 01:43:42,785
Mother?

1194
01:44:22,282 --> 01:44:23,742
I wonder...

1195
01:44:43,888 --> 01:44:45,264
I wonder...

1196
01:46:02,049 --> 01:46:04,677
There are two types of lures.

1197
01:46:04,885 --> 01:46:07,929
There are soft lures,
made of rubber.

1198
01:46:08,430 --> 01:46:11,726
They look like small fish
or worms,

1199
01:46:11,893 --> 01:46:14,812
to catch other fish, they say.

1200
01:46:16,731 --> 01:46:20,151
And the other type...

1201
01:46:20,735 --> 01:46:24,863
is the hard lure,
it's called the hard lure.

1202
01:46:25,071 --> 01:46:28,241
They're made from
wood or plastic,

1203
01:46:29,326 --> 01:46:33,955
and they're used to catch
big fish and things like that.

1204
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:38,169
Where did you learn all that?

1205
01:46:40,213 --> 01:46:41,380
It was in a book.

1206
01:46:41,671 --> 01:46:42,839
In a book.

1207
01:46:48,720 --> 01:46:50,514
I'm sorry,
you're doing my time, too.

1208
01:46:50,807 --> 01:46:52,474
You've got a record.

1209
01:46:54,059 --> 01:46:56,187
You wouldn't get away
with just five years.

1210
01:46:57,396 --> 01:46:58,606
But you...

1211
01:46:59,232 --> 01:47:01,317
I had such a good time,

1212
01:47:03,527 --> 01:47:05,737
this is nothing, really.

1213
01:47:08,198 --> 01:47:09,407
I'm sorry.

1214
01:47:11,035 --> 01:47:12,745
It's because I got caught.

1215
01:47:16,206 --> 01:47:19,168
Don't worry about it.
Things don't always work out.

1216
01:47:20,753 --> 01:47:21,753
Right?

1217
01:47:22,839 --> 01:47:24,506
How is the facility?

1218
01:47:25,215 --> 01:47:27,134
Are you going to school
every day?

1219
01:47:27,343 --> 01:47:30,220
Yes, I got 8th place
in my Japanese test.

1220
01:47:31,930 --> 01:47:33,933
You're smart, Shota, right?

1221
01:47:35,893 --> 01:47:37,687
Did you cut your hair?

1222
01:47:40,438 --> 01:47:42,482
You look good, let's see.

1223
01:47:42,732 --> 01:47:44,151
He looks good, right?

1224
01:47:44,402 --> 01:47:46,654
You look cute, cute.

1225
01:47:46,862 --> 01:47:48,905
Doesn't he look handsome?

1226
01:47:51,284 --> 01:47:52,492
You look sweet.

1227
01:47:57,372 --> 01:47:58,372
Shota.

1228
01:47:59,584 --> 01:48:00,585
Listen...

1229
01:48:01,794 --> 01:48:03,336
We found you...

1230
01:48:04,379 --> 01:48:06,089
at the pachinko parlor.

1231
01:48:06,924 --> 01:48:08,551
The pachinko parlor in Matsudo.

1232
01:48:09,634 --> 01:48:12,053
The car was a red Toyota Vitz.

1233
01:48:14,764 --> 01:48:17,058
The license plate was Narashino.

1234
01:48:18,936 --> 01:48:19,978
Hey.

1235
01:48:22,522 --> 01:48:23,900
If you really want to,

1236
01:48:24,275 --> 01:48:26,652
you can find your
real mom and dad.

1237
01:48:30,615 --> 01:48:31,615
Hey, you.

1238
01:48:33,409 --> 01:48:36,411
Did you tell me to bring Shota
here so you could tell him that?

1239
01:48:36,829 --> 01:48:37,830
That's right.

1240
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:42,959
You know it, too.

1241
01:48:45,129 --> 01:48:48,006
We're not good enough for him.

1242
01:49:04,106 --> 01:49:05,316
I'm done.

1243
01:49:08,945 --> 01:49:09,987
Hey.

1244
01:49:14,575 --> 01:49:15,576
Bye.

1245
01:49:16,952 --> 01:49:17,952
Hey.

1246
01:49:31,384 --> 01:49:32,552
Wow, amazing!

1247
01:49:44,647 --> 01:49:48,192
So tasty, a super combo.

1248
01:49:48,401 --> 01:49:49,527
Right?

1249
01:49:51,696 --> 01:49:53,238
Who taught you this?

1250
01:49:58,411 --> 01:49:59,411
Me?

1251
01:50:05,793 --> 01:50:09,213
Do you live here all alone?

1252
01:50:11,756 --> 01:50:13,092
It's tiny

1253
01:50:14,177 --> 01:50:16,094
but the bath is brand new.

1254
01:50:17,220 --> 01:50:18,430
Want a bath later?

1255
01:50:21,558 --> 01:50:22,809
I'm not sure.

1256
01:50:23,102 --> 01:50:25,021
You're more than welcome to.

1257
01:50:26,313 --> 01:50:27,647
The bath is super clean.

1258
01:50:29,232 --> 01:50:30,860
Maybe I'll spend the night here.

1259
01:50:33,653 --> 01:50:35,322
But won't they get mad at you?

1260
01:50:37,866 --> 01:50:39,576
No different if I go back now.

1261
01:50:42,621 --> 01:50:43,664
Right.

1262
01:50:59,930 --> 01:51:00,973
Hey, Shota.

1263
01:51:02,224 --> 01:51:03,226
Shota!

1264
01:51:04,559 --> 01:51:05,727
Come out here.

1265
01:51:12,527 --> 01:51:13,945
The snow's piling up.

1266
01:51:19,157 --> 01:51:20,409
Hey, be careful.

1267
01:51:30,001 --> 01:51:31,545
Let's make a snowman!

1268
01:52:33,523 --> 01:52:35,901
Tomorrow, you go home, right?

1269
01:52:37,945 --> 01:52:38,945
Yup.

1270
01:52:40,238 --> 01:52:41,406
Right.

1271
01:52:46,787 --> 01:52:47,787
Say...

1272
01:52:50,207 --> 01:52:52,293
Did you try to run away
without me?

1273
01:53:06,139 --> 01:53:07,139
Yeah.

1274
01:53:09,977 --> 01:53:11,269
It's true.

1275
01:53:14,648 --> 01:53:16,733
But we got caught, first.

1276
01:53:19,237 --> 01:53:20,363
I see.

1277
01:53:22,990 --> 01:53:24,157
I'm sorry.

1278
01:53:33,166 --> 01:53:34,376
From now on...

1279
01:53:37,629 --> 01:53:39,464
I'm not your dad.

1280
01:53:51,853 --> 01:53:52,853
Yup.

1281
01:54:15,334 --> 01:54:17,003
You tell them you're sorry.

1282
01:54:20,298 --> 01:54:22,717
Tell them I made you
spend the night.

1283
01:54:24,218 --> 01:54:25,803
Right, I'll do that.

1284
01:54:30,474 --> 01:54:32,767
I'm sorry, I can't see you.

1285
01:54:32,893 --> 01:54:34,352
I got caught.

1286
01:54:36,313 --> 01:54:38,648
I got caught on purpose.

1287
01:54:45,740 --> 01:54:46,782
I see.

1288
01:55:00,545 --> 01:55:01,546
Hey, Shota.

1289
01:55:19,439 --> 01:55:21,233
Shota! Shota!

1290
01:55:54,683 --> 01:55:56,017
Dad.

1291
01:56:02,775 --> 01:56:06,320
One... Two...

1292
01:56:06,571 --> 01:56:09,740
Buckle my shoe

1293
01:56:09,948 --> 01:56:13,661
Three, four, knock at the door

1294
01:56:15,662 --> 01:56:19,500
Five, six, pick up sticks

1295
01:56:20,375 --> 01:56:23,753
Seven, eight, lay them straight

1296
01:56:23,963 --> 01:56:28,175
Nine, ten, a big fat hen

1297
01:56:28,634 --> 01:56:30,595
One, two...
