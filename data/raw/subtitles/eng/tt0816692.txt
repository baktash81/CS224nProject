Yes, you do.

MAN:
Explain to me how you found this facility.

348
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:58,658
Kind of an accident. We sort of stumbled
upon it. We were on a salvage run...

349
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:01,536
You're sitting in the best-kept secret
in the world.

350
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:05,206
Nobody stumbles in here.
Nobody stumbles out.

00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,208

00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:09,752
Cooperate with these people.

353
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,129
Look.

354
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,714
It's kind of hard to explain.

355
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:18,219
We learned these coordinates
from an anomaly.

356
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,304
What sort of anomaly?

357
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,766
I hesitate to term it supernatural,
but it definitely wasn't scientific.

358
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:27,854
You're going to have to be specific,
Mr. Cooper. Right now.

359
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,272
It was gravity.

360
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:37,155
Um, what sort of gravitational anomaly?
Where was this?

361
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,616
Now, I'm real happy that you're excited
about gravity, bud...

362
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,995
...but you're not getting any answers from us
until I get assurances.

363
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,454
- Assurances?
COOPER: Yeah.

00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,750
Like, that we're getting out of here.
And I don't mean in the trunk of some car.

from the stratosphere...

...onto starving people.

375
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,453
When they realized
that killing other people was...

376
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,456
...not a long-term solution,
then they needed us back.

377
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,625
- In secret.
- Why secret?

378

allow spending on space exploration.

But like the potatoes in Ireland
and the wheat in the Dust Bowl...

But it is our home.

Earth's atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen.

We don't even breathe nitrogen.

00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:28,391
Blight does. And as it thrives,
our air gets less and less oxygen.

The last components of our one versatile ship
in orbit, the <i>Endurance.</i>

405
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,599
Our final expedition.

00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,567
- Oh, that sounds cheerful.
- Lazarus came back from the dead.

409
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,902
Sure, but he had to die in the first place.

410
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,239
There's not a planet in our solar system
that could sustain life...

411
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,908
...and the nearest star's
over a thousand years away.

...to pilot this craft.

- You're the best pilot we ever had.
- I barely left the stratosphere.

This team never left the simulator.

419
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:50,556
We need a pilot, and this is the mission
that you were trained for.

420
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,224
Without even knowing it?

421
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:57,521
An hour ago, you didn't even know I was alive.
You were going anyway.

422
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,398
We had no choice.

423
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,317
But something sent you here.

424
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:04,362
- They chose you.
- Who's "they"?

425
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,246

426
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,750
Hard to know. Years?

00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,086

429

Who's "they"?

430
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:31,347
We started detecting gravitational anomalies
almost 50 years ago.

431
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:35,309
Mostly small distortions to our instruments
in the upper atmosphere.

432
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:38,604
In fact, I believe
you encountered one yourself.

433
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,273
Yeah, over the Straights.

434
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:45,319
My crash. Something tripped my fly-by-wire.

435
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:46,695
Exactly.

436
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:52,451
But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this:

437
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,620
Out near Saturn...

438
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:56,872
...a disturbance of space-time.

439
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,128
- Is that a wormhole?
- It appeared 48 years ago.

440
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,505
And it leads where?

441
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,674
Another galaxy.

442
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,678
A wormhole's not
a naturally occurring phenomenon.

443
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,263
Someone placed it there.

444
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,557
- "They"?
- Mm.

445
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:19,145
And whoever they are,
they appear to be looking out for us.

446
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,189
That wormhole lets us travel to other stars.

447
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,275
It came along right as we needed it.

448
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:27,361
They've put potentially habitable worlds
right within our reach.

449
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,447
Twelve, in fact, from our initial probes.

450
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,991
- You sent probes into that?
- Mm-hm.

451
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,161

Twelve possible worlds...

454
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,209
...twelve Ranger launches carrying...

455
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,087
...the bravest humans ever to live...

456
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:47,882
...led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.

457
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,385
Each person's landing pod
had enough life support for two years.

458
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:53,512
But they could use hibernation
to stretch that...

459
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,891
...making observations on organics
over a decade or more.

460
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:00,895
Their mission was to assess their world,
and if it showed potential...

461
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:05,649
...then they could send out a signal,
bed down for the long nap, wait to be rescued.

462
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,860
And what if the world didn't show promise?

463
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:09,904
Hence the bravery.

464
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,240
You don't have the resources
to visit all 12.

465
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,533
No.

466
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,204
Data transmission back through
the wormhole is rudimentary.

467
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:23,417
Simple binary pings on an annual basis give us
some clue as to which worlds have potential.

468
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,377
And one system shows promise.

469
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,255
One. That's a bit of a long shot, isn't it?

470
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,926
One system with three potential worlds?

471
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,928
No long shot.

472
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,223
Okay.

473
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,267
So if we find a home...

474
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:46,398
- ...then what?
- That's the long shot.

475
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,944
There's a Plan A and a Plan B.

476
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,405
Did you notice anything strange
about the launch chamber?

477
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:08,045
COOPER:
This entire facility's a centrifuge.

478
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,881
Some kind of vehicle. A space station?

Both. Plan A.

480
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,219
How do you get it off the ground?

481
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:19,056
The first gravitational anomalies
changed everything.

482
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:23,727
Suddenly we knew
that harnessing gravity was real.

483
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:28,732
So I started working on a theory
and we started building this station.

484
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,193
But you haven't solved it yet.

485
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,821
That's why there's Plan B.

486
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:39,034
The problem is gravity. How to get
a viable amount of human life off the planet.

487
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,494
This is one way.

488
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:43,330
Plan B: a population bomb.

489
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:48,419
Over 5,000 fertilized eggs
weighing in at just under 900 kilos.

490
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:50,629
How would you raise them?

491
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,257
With equipment on board,
we incubate the first 10.

492
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:57,303
After that, with surrogacy,
the growth becomes exponential.

493
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:01,307
Within 30 years,
we could have a colony of hundreds.

494
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:04,852
The real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity.

495
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,021
This takes care of that.

496
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,648
But what about the people here? You just...

497
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,358
...give up on them?

498
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,235

499
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:17,114
That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.

- Almost there.

00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,769
No, that does not make it wrong.

516
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,062
It might.

517
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,565
Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

518
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,652
The why of the thing, that's the foundation.

519
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,904
And the foundation's solid.

520
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:47,079
We farmers, we sit here every year
when the rains fail and we say:

521
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,622
"Next year."

522
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,960
Well, next year ain't gonna save us,
nor the one after that.

523
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:57,923
This world's a treasure, Donald,
but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.

524
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,432
Mankind was born on Earth,
it was never meant to die here.

525
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,771
Tom will be all right,
but you got to make things right with Murph.

526
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:13,981
I will.

527
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:18,110
Without making promises
you don't know you can keep.

528
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,748
You have to talk to me, Murph.

529
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,377
I need to fix this before I go.

530
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,422
MURPH:
Then I'll keep it broken so you have to stay.

531
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:45,012
After you kids came along, your mom said
something to me I never quite understood.

532
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,014
She said, "Now...

533
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:53,395
...we're just here
to be memories for our kids."

534
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,028
And I think that now I understand
what she meant.

535
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:08,535
Once you're a parent,
you're the ghost of your children's future.

536
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:12,331
You said ghosts didn't exist.

537
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,297
That's right, Murph.

538
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,843
Murph, look at me.

539
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,390
I can't be your ghost right now.

540
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,186
I need to exist.

541
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,731
They chose me.

542
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:42,402
Murph, they chose me. You saw.
You're the one who led me to them.

543
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,533
That's exactly why you can't go.

544
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,704
I figured out the message.

545
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:56,333
- One word. Know what it is?
- Murph.

546
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,835
"Stay."

547
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:01,088
- It says, "Stay," Dad.
- Murph.

548
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,507
You don't believe me.

549
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:06,468
Look at the books! Look at this.
It says, "Stay."

550
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:09,596
Why...? You're not listening! It says, "Stay!"

551
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,765
No, I'm coming back.

552
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,267
When?

553
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,740
One for you, one for me.

554
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,286
When I'm up there in hypersleep, or...

555
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,163
...traveling near the speed of light, or...

556
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,292
...near a black hole...

557
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:43,297
...time's gonna change for me.
It's gonna run more slowly.

558
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,675
When we get back...

559
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,219
...we're gonna compare.

560
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,014
MURPH: Time will run differently for us?
- Yeah.

561
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:57,769
By the time I get back,
we might even be the same age, you and me.

562
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,480
"What?" Imagine that!

563
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,194
Aw, Murph...

564
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,989
You have no idea when you're coming back.

565
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,284
No idea at all!

566
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,539
Murph, don't... Don't make me leave like this.

567
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:19,207
Come on, Murph!

568
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,044
Don't make me leave like this, Murph!

569
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:30,677
Hey...

570
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,554
...I love you.

571
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,848
Forever. You hear me?

572
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:38,518
I love you forever, and I'm coming back.

573
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,651
I'm coming back.

574
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,046
- How'd it go?
- Fine.

575
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,256
Just fine.

576
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:15,847
I love you, Tom.

577
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,517
- Travel safe, huh?
- Yeah.

578
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:20,936
You look after our place for me, all right?

579
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:22,729
- All right?
- Uh-huh.

580
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:30,612
- Hey, can I use your truck while you're gone?
- You mean your truck?

581
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,740
I'll make sure they bring it back.

582
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,661
Look after my kids, Donald!

583
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:53,760
TARS:
<i>Go for main engine start. T-minus 10...</i>

584
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:56,513
- Dad!
<i>- ...nine...</i>

00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:57,931

All engines look good.
Beginning roll program.

595
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,469
Prepare for stage one separation.

596
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:36,845
Stage one.

597
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,644
There is Mach 1.

598
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:49,316
Everybody good?
Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?

599
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:54,488
They gave him a humor setting
so he'd fit in better with his unit.

600
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,490
He thinks it relaxes us.

601
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:59,451
A giant sarcastic robot.

602
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:01,745
What a great idea!

603
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,623
TARS: I have a cue light I can use
when I'm joking if you like.

604
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:05,832
That'd probably help.

605
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,920
You can use it to find your way back
to the ship after I blow you out the airlock.

606
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:14,007
- What's your humor setting, TARS?
- That's 100 percent.

607
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:15,967
Let's bring it on down to 75, please.

608
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,136
TARS:
Stage two separation.

609
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,982
COOPER:
All feeds going manual.

610
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,692
MAN:
Going manual.

611
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,155
COOPER:
Deactivate probe heater one, two and three.

612
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,365
MAN:
Check.

613
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,873
- Taking control.
TARS: This is handover to you.

614
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,004
MAN: A.D.F. check.
COOPER: Over.

615
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:57,008
Pull thrusters back.
Fuel cells one, two, three.

COOPER:
Ex-mites.

618
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,314
It's hard leaving everything.

619
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:14,192
My kids. Your father.

620
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,195
We're going to be spending
a lot of time together.

621
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:20,407
- We should learn to talk.
- And when not to.

622
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,244
Just being honest.

623
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:26,746
I don't think you need to be that honest.

624
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,583
Hey, TARS, what's your honesty parameter?

625
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,377
TARS: Ninety percent.
- Ninety percent?

626
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:35,589
Absolute honesty isn't always
the most diplomatic, nor the...

627
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,341
...safest form of communication
with emotional beings.

628
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,968
Okay.

629
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:43,054
Ninety percent it is, Dr. Brand.

630
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,978
We are coming up on the <i>Endurance.</i>
Twelve minutes out.

631
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,080
Okay. Taking control.

632
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,420
Approaching module port, 500 meters.

633
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:29,559
It's all you, Doyle.

634
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,580
Nice and easy, Doyle. Nice and easy.

635
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,003
I feel good.

636
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,338
Take us home.

00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:00,173
[BEEPING]

638
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,473
- Lock.
- Target locked.

639
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:10,475
COOPER: Well done.
- Okay, helmets on.

640
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:11,685
Good job.

641
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:46,886
Door's not charging.

642
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,555
Never mind.

643
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:13,038
Cooper, you should have control.

644
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,873
Control here.

645
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:18,918

00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:43,943
COOPER: <i>Are we ready to spin?</i>
- Just a sec.

649
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:57,707
- Hello, CASE.
- Hello, TARS.

650
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,585
All right, we're all set.

651
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:02,545
All right, let's do it.

652
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,357
Heh.

<i>How's gravity treating you back there?</i>

656
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,505
Well.

657
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:50,468
Romilly? Hey, you okay?

658
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:51,678
- Yeah.
- You all right?

659
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:53,930
Mm. Yeah, I just need a minute.

660
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:59,018
We have some Dramamine in the hab pod,
or maybe in the cryo-beds. I'll just be a sec.

661
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,354
- Hey, Brand?
- Yeah?

662
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:03,523
- Bring a lot.
- Heh-heh-heh.

<i>- Give my regards to Dr. Mann.</i>
- I will, Dad.

00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,790
<i>It looks good for your trajectory.</i>

00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:24,294
<i>We've calculated two years to Saturn.</i>

667
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,546
That's a lot of Dramamine.

00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:29,716
Look after my family, will you, please, sir?

669
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:33,052
<i>We'll be waiting for you when you get back.</i>

670
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:37,390
<i>A little older, a little wiser,
but happy to see you.</i>

00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:48,276
<i>Old age should burn and rave at close of day</i>

00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:31,945
Okay, thank you.

00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,783
Here. Pills.

681
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:40,954
So alone.

682
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,414
We have each other. Dr. Mann had it worse.

683
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:44,958
No, I mean them.

684
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,251
Hm?

685
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:49,712
COOPER: It's a perfect planet,
and we won't find another one like her.

686
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:53,550
No, it's not like looking for a new condo.

687
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:56,844

Gargantua, parallel with Miller's planet...
