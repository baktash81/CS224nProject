1
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:08,211
Colm?

2
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,173
Are you coming out to the pub, Colm?

3
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,554
It's 2:00, like.

4
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:24,978
Will I see you down there, so?

5
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,567
I'll see you down there, so.

6
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,990
What are you doin' home?

7
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,616
Brother?

8
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:21,910
What are you doin' home?

9
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,538
I knocked on ColmSonnyLarry.
He's just sitting there.

10
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,748
Sitting there doin' what?

11
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,250
Sittin' there doin' nothing.

12
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:29,793
Smoking.

13
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:31,795
Was he asleep?

14
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,299
He was smoking, Siobhán.
How do you smoke in your sleep, like?

15
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,176
Have ye been rowing?

16
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,927
We haven't been rowin'.

17
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:43,307
I don't think we've been rowin'.

18
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,518
Have we been rowin'?

19
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,817
Why wouldn't he answer the door to me?

20
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,654
Maybe he just doesn't like you no more.

21
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:25,766
Pint, Jonjo.

22
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,106
Is Colm not with you?

23
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,733
- No.
- Colm's always with you.

24
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,027
- I know.
- Did you not knock for him?

25
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,278
I did knock for him.

26
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,821
- Well, where is he?
- Just sittin' there.

27
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,031
Sittin' there doin' what?

28
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:42,366
Sittin' there doing nothin'.

29
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,326
Smokin'.

30
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:46,912
Have ye been rowin'?

31
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,247
I don't think we've been rowin'.

32
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,581
Sounds like ye've been rowin'.

33
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,750
It does sound like we've been rowin'.

34
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,460
Will I try him again?

35
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,087
That'd be the best thing.

36
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:04,680
Officer Kearney.

37
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:09,810
Never says "hello."

38
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,187
Never fecking says "hello."

39
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:21,905
Colm?

40
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,836
Colm?

41
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,299
The door was open, Colm.

42
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:50,809
Colm?

43
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,926
Where the hell are you headin' off to?

44
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,140
- Everybody?
- No, this is true.

45
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,059
He scored six points from open play.

46
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,271
He was barely the size of a dwarf!

47
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:37,439
This is true!

48
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:43,737
- Howdo.
- Howdo, Pádraic.

49
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,239
Sit somewhere else.

50
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:47,366
Huh?

51
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,455
But I have me pint there, Colm.

52
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:54,873
He has his pint there, Colm...

53
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,376
from when he came in
and ordered his pint before.

54
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,877
Okay.

55
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,963
I'll sit somewhere else, so.

56
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,806
Are ye rowin'?

57
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:12,266
I didn't think we were rowin'.

58
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,559
Well, ye are rowin'.

59
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:14,810
Well, ye are rowin'.
He's sittin' outside...

60
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,353
on his own like a whatchamacallit.

61
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,522
It does look like we're rowin'.

62
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,861
Well, I suppose I'd
best go talk to him, so.

63
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,196
See what all this is fecking about.

64
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:27,865
That'd be the best thing.

65
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:31,827
Now I'm sittin' here next to you...

66
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:33,370
and if you're goin' back inside,
I'm followin' you inside...

67
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,956
and if you're goin' home,
I'm followin' you there, too.

68
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,544
Now, if I've done somethin' to ya...

69
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:41,753
just tell me what I've done to ya.

70
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,921
And if I've said somethin' to ya...

71
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,756
maybe I said somethin' when I was drunk,
and I've forgotten it...

72
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,884
but I don't think I said somethin'
when I was drunk, and I've forgotten it.

73
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,844
But if I did, then tell me what it was...

74
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:50,929
and I'll say sorry for that too, Colm.

75
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,057
With all me heart, I'll say sorry.

76
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,061
Just stop running away from me
like some fool of a moody schoolchild.

77
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:01,064
But you didn't say anything to me.

78
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,026
And you didn't do anything to me.

79
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,528
That's what I was thinking, like.

80
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,573
I just don't like you no more.

81
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,418
You do like me.

82
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,295
I don't.

83
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,256
But you liked me yesterday.

84
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,799
Did I, yeah?

85
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:30,844
I thought you did.

86
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,084
Pádraic.

87
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:03,252
Dominic.

88
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,255
What's the matter with ya?

89
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,674
There's nothing the matter with me,
for God's sake.

90
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:10,592
Look at this I found.

91
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,344
A stick with a hook.

92
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,096
What would you use it for, I wonder?

93
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:17,182
To hook things
that were the length of a stick away?

94
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,560
Where you goin'?

95
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:20,727
Down here.

96
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,354
As good a plan as any!

97
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:23,772
- Have you any fags?
- No.

98
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,941
You do. You always have fags.

99
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:28,610
ColmSonnyLarry's at Jonjo's
handing out a rake of fags.

100
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:29,820
Whoever's in the mood for one.

101
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:30,988
- Is he?
- No!

102
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:38,954
You're behavin' awful unusual.

103
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:53,969
What are you doin' here?

104
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,557
Was the pub closed?

105
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,809
No, it was open.

106
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,191
Anything in the paper?

107
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,277
Just the Civil War still.

108
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:13,780
A bad do.

109
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,753
Mrs. McCormick's comin' over
later, Pádraic. I couldn't avoid her.

110
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,005
I don't know if you're gonna be in or out,
but you're usually out.

111
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:31,715
Am I?

112
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,550
You are. Yeah, you know you are.

113
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,177
I don't care, Siobhán.

114
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,721
This is your house, too.

115
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:08,210
Is it six years since
your mammy and daddy died, Siobhán...

116
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,963
or is it seven years since they died?

117
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:15,050
It's coming up to eight years,
Mrs. McCormick, aye.

118
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:17,636
Is it comin' up to eight years?

119
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,181
Doesn't time be flyin'?

120
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,392
Aye, when you're havin' fun.

121
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:26,353
Be off to the pub now, Pádraic,
if you're gonna be annoyin' us.

122
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,564
I don't have to be down there
every night, do I?

123
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:36,071
ColmSonnyLarry's scared him off, I suppose.

124
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:40,117
What did you hear of ColmSonnyLarry?

125
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:43,537
Didn't you and he
used to be the best of friends?

126
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:44,913
We're still the best of friends.

127
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,331
- No, you're not.
- Who says we're not?

128
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:47,499
She says.

129
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:48,876
For God's sake, Siobhán.

130
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,129
I said nothing of the like, Mrs. McCormick!
I was just chatting.

131
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:55,382
Now, you go off to Jonjo's, Pádraic,
and don't be getting under our feet.

132
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:58,093
Sure, Mrs. McCormick never gets a chance
to come over for a chat.

133
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,678
She never gets a chance
'cause you avoid her.

134
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:00,846
I do not avoid her!

135
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:03,348
You hide behind walls
if she's coming up the road.

136
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,767
I do not...

137
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,395
hide behind walls.

138
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:21,950
Good luck to ye.

139
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:25,495
Whatever it is you're fightin' about.

140
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:35,047
PUBLIC HOUSE
J. J. DEVINE

141
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,154
I didn't hear there was to be a session.

142
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:00,781
Last-minute thing.

143
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:02,449
Colm decided.

144
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,746
All the ladies love Colm, you know.
Always did.

145
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:10,207
Yeah?
That's not true.

146
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,502
You're still barred, Dominic!
Out!

147
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:15,128
You said barred until April.

148
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,296
What are we now?

149
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,464
April.

150
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:20,092
Well, put that stick outside anyways,
and don't be bothering the women.

151
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:21,260
There's women?

152
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,053
There is women.

153
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,346
And good ones.

154
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:35,858
<i>Well, I took out my dog</i>

155
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:38,694
<i>And him I did shoot</i>

156
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:43,907
<i>All down in the County Kildare...</i>

157
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:48,287
If we sat next to Colm,
the women would have to talk to us too...

158
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,581
and then we could get at them
with our small talk.

159
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,875
I'm happy enough sittin' here, now.

160
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:54,793
Are ya, yeah?

161
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:56,420
Are ya happy enough, yeah?

162
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:59,882
<i>So fill up your glasses
With brandy...</i>

163
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,050
I can't stand the maudlin ones.

164
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,178
Play somethin' dancey, Colm!

165
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:05,971
To dance to.

166
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:08,182
And not have that mope whining.

167
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:18,192
<i>So be easy and free...</i>

168
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,528
Here, amn't I in enough trouble with him
without your mouthing?

169
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,655
What trouble in are you in with him?

170
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,449
He just...

171
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,827
doesn't want to be friends with me no more.

172
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,206
What is he, 12?

173
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:37,753
Why does he not
want to be friends with you no more?

174
00:14:57,439 --> 00:15:00,317
Daddy'll kill us if we wake him
when he's been wanking.

175
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:27,970
You won't get into trouble
for taking his poteen?

176
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,097
I will get into trouble...

177
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,057
but fuck it.

178
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:38,105
I saw cannon-fire and rifle-fire
on the mainland tonight.

179
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:39,481
Did you see it?

180
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:41,692
That'll be the Civil War.

181
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,443
I know that, sure.

182
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,446
Me, I pay no attention to wars.
I'm agin 'em.

183
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:48,365
Wars and soap.

184
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,287
I tell you this much.

185
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,831
We're good at chatting, aren't we?

186
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:57,291
Me and you?

187
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:03,589
Your sister, does she like to chat?

188
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:06,967
Not as much as most women,
but she'll chat, like.

189
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:08,552
She more likes reading.

190
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:10,762
Reading?

191
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:13,640
Feckin' hell.

192
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:15,392
Reading.

193
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:22,441
And did you ever see
her with no clothes on?

194
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:26,653
I didn't.

195
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,781
Did you not, and you her brother?

196
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:32,826
Not even as a child?

197
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:35,537
I don't like to be chattin'
about these types of things, Dominic!

198
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:36,705
What types of things?

199
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:38,165
Sisters with no clothes on!

200
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,501
You saw my daddy with no clothes on.

201
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,045
And till the day I die, I'll wish I hadn't.

202
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:44,671
Sure, don't I know it.

203
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:48,842
The tiny, brown cock on him.

204
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:58,769
What's the matter with him?

205
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:03,482
Maybe bad news he's had?

206
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:04,983
Daddy?

207
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,569
No, ColmSonnyLarry.

208
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:11,823
Didn't I tell ya I'd be off if you went
whining about that lummox one more time?

209
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,827
I tell ya, it didn't look like
he had bad news tonight.

210
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,664
It looked like a weight was lifted
from his shoulders tonight.

211
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:04,084
MARCH 1923

212
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,672
APRIL 1923
FRI 1

213
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:35,532
Just bringing me cows past.

214
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:36,700
What?

215
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:39,870
I was just bringing me cows past.
I wasn't, you know, trying to...

216
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:42,122
You don't usually bring them this way.

217
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:45,626
I don't, but then the little fella
took a fright at a hen on the corner, so...

218
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:50,380
I only...

219
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:55,427
I only just saw
what month we changed to yesterday.

220
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:01,350
More fool me?

221
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:07,022
Changed to April.

222
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,157
So, will I be callin' for ya
on me way to the pub later?

223
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:21,787
I will so.

224
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,039
Anyways...

225
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:27,835
I better chase after these goons
for they're gettin' away from me.

226
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:32,965
Maybe they don't like me no more neither.

227
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,512
See you at 2:00, so, Colm.

228
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:45,352
Why don't you come down for a sherry later?

229
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,771
There's no need to be stuck inside
on a nice day.

230
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:50,732
I will so.

231
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:52,192
How's the book?

232
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:55,362
It's sad.

233
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:56,613
Sad?

234
00:19:57,281 --> 00:20:00,158
Well, you should read a not sad
one, Siobhán, else you might get sad.

235
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:12,129
Do you never get lonely, Pádraic?

236
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:17,634
Never get what?

237
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:20,429
Lonely.

238
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:23,765
Do I never get lonely?

239
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,104
What's the matter with everybody?

240
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:33,066
Jesus.

241
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:38,155
"Lonely." Fecking hell.

242
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:51,460
Colm?

243
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,121
Pint, Jonjo.

244
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,925
How's he seem?

245
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:42,511
Grand, I think.
With me, anyways.

246
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,522
What are you doing?

247
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:56,358
So you're gonna be
an eejit again today, is it?

248
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:58,485
Amn't I allowed to have
a quiet pint on me own, Pádraic?

249
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:00,737
Well, don't ask a man to call up to ya
at your fecking house, so...

250
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:02,406
like he has nothing better to do
with his fecking time.

251
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:04,783
I didn't ask you to call up to me
at me house.

252
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,618
And you do have nothing better to do
with your fecking time.

253
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:10,706
You do have nothing better to do
with your fecking time.

254
00:22:10,873 --> 00:22:12,791
I know I've nothing better to do
with me fecking time...

255
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,918
but there's better things I could be doing
with me fecking time...

256
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:17,045
than to be calling up to ya
at your house, Colm Doherty!

257
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:18,714
Like what?

258
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:22,050
Like what else could you be doin'?

259
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,761
Reading.

260
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:26,013
Reading, yeah?

261
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,349
Me, this morning...

262
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:32,561
this I wrote.

263
00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:06,136
Tomorrow, I'll write the second part of it.

264
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:09,097
And the day after,
I'll write the third part of it.

265
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:11,975
And by Wednesday,
there'll be a new tune in the world...

266
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:14,978
which wouldn't have been there
if I'd spent the week...

267
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:17,231
listening to your bollocks,
Pádraic Súilleabháin.

268
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:22,694
So, do you want to take your pint outside,
or do you want me to take my pint outside?

269
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:26,240
I'll take my pint outside,
'cause it's a shite tune anyways...

270
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,033
I wouldn't bother with it.

271
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:00,607
I was too harsh yesterday.

272
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:02,192
Yesterday, he says.

273
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:05,487
I know well you was too harsh yesterday.

274
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:06,655
And today.

275
00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:08,824
I just...

276
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:14,246
I just have this tremendous sense of time
slippin' away on me, Pádraic.

277
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:19,376
And I think I need to spend the time
I have left thinking and composing.

278
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:22,337
Just trying not to listen...

279
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:24,965
to any more of the dull things
that you have to say for yourself.

280
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:27,426
But I'm sorry about it.
I am, like.

281
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:30,679
Are you dying?

282
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:32,347
No, I'm not dying.

283
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:36,059
But then you've loads of time.

284
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:37,436
For chatting?

285
00:24:37,603 --> 00:24:38,937
- Aye.
- For aimless chatting?

286
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:42,816
Not for aimless chatting.
For good, normal chatting.

287
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:48,989
So, we'll keep aimlessly chatting
and me life'll keep dwindling.

288
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:52,993
And in 12 years,
I'll die with nothin' to show for it...

289
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,413
bar the chats I've had with a limited man,
is that it?

290
00:24:57,873 --> 00:25:00,584
I said, "Not aimless chatting."

291
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:04,379
I said, "Good, normal chatting."

292
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:07,508
The other night,
two hours you spent talking to me...

293
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:10,219
about the things you found
in your little donkey's shite that day.

294
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:12,054
Two hours, Pádraic.
I timed it.

295
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:15,015
Well, it wasn't me little donkey's shite,
was it?

296
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:18,018
It was me pony's shite,
which shows how much you were listenin'.

297
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:20,312
None of it helps me, do you understand?

298
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:22,940
None of it helps me.

299
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:33,742
We'll just chat about somethin' else then.

300
00:25:58,267 --> 00:25:59,476
What's the matter with ya?

301
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:00,853
Nothin'.

302
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:02,187
Aren't we going for a sherry?

303
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:03,689
Don't feel like it.

304
00:26:05,524 --> 00:26:08,694
No, I'm not having this again today!

305
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:15,409
Hey! What the hell's going on with you
and me fecking brother?

306
00:26:15,576 --> 00:26:16,869
Don't come in here
shouting the odds at me...

307
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:18,328
in the middle of the fecking day,
all right, Siobhán?

308
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:21,540
You can't just all of a sudden
stop being friends with a fella!

309
00:26:21,707 --> 00:26:22,791
Why can't I?

310
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:26,587
Why can't ya? Because it isn't nice.

311
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:27,880
- Do you want a sherry, Siobhán?
- No!

312
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:28,964
Righty-ho.

313
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:30,340
Has he said somethin' to ya
when he was drunk?

314
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:31,925
No, I prefer him when he's drunk.

315
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:33,886
It's all the rest of the time
I have the problem with.

316
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:35,679
What's the fecking matter, then?

317
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:37,181
He's dull, Siobhán.

318
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,141
He's what?

319
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,351
He's dull.

320
00:26:44,062 --> 00:26:47,482
But he's always been dull.
What's changed?

321
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:49,860
I've changed.

322
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:53,822
I just don't have a place for dullness
in me life anymore.

323
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:58,285
But you live on an island
off the coast of Ireland, Colm.

324
00:26:58,452 --> 00:27:00,412
What the hell are you hoping for, like?

325
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:03,332
For a bit of peace, Siobhán.
That's all.

326
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:06,919
For a bit of peace in me heart, like.

327
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:11,089
You can understand that.
Can't ya?

328
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,558
Can't ya?

329
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,562
Do you think I'm dull?

330
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:09,898
No. 'Cause you're not dull, you're nice.

331
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:12,150
That's what I thought.
I mean, I'm a happy lad.

332
00:28:13,652 --> 00:28:14,987
Or I was.

333
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:17,614
Till me best friend
started acting the gilly-gooly.

334
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:19,950
It's him, Pádraic.

335
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:22,160
Maybe he's just depressed.

336
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:26,748
That's what I was thinking,
that he's depressed.

337
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,460
Well, if he is, he could at least
keep it to himself, like.

338
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:32,504
You know, push it
down, like the rest of us.

339
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:36,216
No, Jenny! Out!

340
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:37,968
Out!

341
00:28:40,262 --> 00:28:41,805
She just wants a bit of company, Siobhán.

342
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:43,515
Animals is for outside, I've told ya.

343
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:52,357
And people don't be laughing at me
behind me back...

344
00:28:52,524 --> 00:28:53,775
do they?

345
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:55,277
No. Why would they be?

346
00:28:55,444 --> 00:28:57,613
They don't think I'm dim or anything?

347
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,281
Dim?

348
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:00,949
No.

349
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:04,161
You don't seem very sure about it.

350
00:29:04,328 --> 00:29:05,913
Of course, I'm sure about it.

351
00:29:07,915 --> 00:29:10,042
Dominic's the dim one
on the island, isn't he?

352
00:29:10,918 --> 00:29:13,212
He is, aye. By miles.

353
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:18,717
Hang on, by miles.
And then, who's the next dimmest?

354
00:29:18,884 --> 00:29:21,512
Well, I don't like to judge people
in those terms now, do I?

355
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:23,013
- In what terms?
- In order of their dimness.

356
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,806
Well, I know you don't.
And neither do I, do I?

357
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:25,891
- But try, like.
- No!

358
00:29:26,058 --> 00:29:27,142
I won't try.

359
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:30,437
There's enough judgy people
on this fecking island, so no!

360
00:29:30,604 --> 00:29:34,399
You're not dim! You're a nice
man, all right? So, move on!

361
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:37,861
I'm as clever as you, anyways.

362
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:39,029
I know that at least.

363
00:29:39,196 --> 00:29:41,156
Yeah, don't be fecking stupid.

364
00:30:29,246 --> 00:30:30,497
What happened to you?

365
00:30:30,664 --> 00:30:32,791
Me daddy discovered the poteen situation.

366
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:34,126
Jesus, Dominic!

367
00:30:34,293 --> 00:30:36,044
You poor thing, ya.

368
00:30:36,211 --> 00:30:37,838
What the hell was he hittin' you with?

369
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:41,049
A kettle was the final thing.
I wouldn'ta minded, but for the spout.

370
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,302
Do you want a ride to church?

371
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:44,761
Feck them gobshites!

372
00:30:44,928 --> 00:30:46,013
Dominic!

373
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,724
But could I stay the
night with ye the night?

374
00:30:48,891 --> 00:30:50,184
Just for the one night, like?

375
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:54,938
Well, just the one night, mind.

376
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:57,733
Nice! I'll see ye for supper, so.

377
00:31:43,362 --> 00:31:44,571
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

378
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:47,282
It's eight weeks
since my last confession, I think.

379
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:49,117
Go on, Colm.

380
00:31:50,327 --> 00:31:54,581
Just the usual, I suppose, Father.
The drinking and the impure thoughts.

381
00:31:55,332 --> 00:31:56,542
And a bit of pride, I suppose.

382
00:31:56,708 --> 00:32:00,254
Although I never really saw that as a sin,
but sure I'm here now.

383
00:32:01,213 --> 00:32:02,214
And...

384
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,092
how's the despair?

385
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:08,846
Not so much of it of late.
Thanks be.

386
00:32:11,223 --> 00:32:13,642
And why aren't you talking
to Pádraic Súilleabháin no more?

387
00:32:16,228 --> 00:32:18,105
That wouldn't be a sin, now,
would it, Father?

388
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:21,859
It wouldn't be a sin, no,
but it's not very nice either, is it?

389
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:24,820
Who told you?

390
00:32:25,863 --> 00:32:28,699
It's an island, Colm. Word gets around.

391
00:32:30,242 --> 00:32:33,287
Also, Pádraic asked me
to put in a word, like.

392
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:35,038
I see.

393
00:32:35,205 --> 00:32:36,248
So...

394
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:40,419
It isn't him
you have the impure thoughts about, is it?

395
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:43,046
Are you joking me?

396
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:46,717
I mean, are you fecking joking me?

397
00:32:46,884 --> 00:32:49,678
People do have impure thoughts
about men, too.

398
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:52,347
Do you have impure thoughts
about men, Father?

399
00:32:53,682 --> 00:32:56,476
I do not have impure thoughts about men.

400
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:59,313
And how dare you say that
about a man of the cloth?

401
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:01,523
Well, you started it.

402
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,526
Well, you can get out of my confessional
right now, so you can.

403
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:07,571
And I'm not forgiving you any of these
things until the next time, so I'm not!

404
00:33:07,738 --> 00:33:09,656
Well, I better not be dying
in the meantime then, eh, Father?

405
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:10,824
I'll be pure fucked!

406
00:33:11,742 --> 00:33:12,951
You will be pure fucked!

407
00:33:13,118 --> 00:33:16,496
Yes, you will be pure fucked!

408
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:33,263
Pint, Colm?

409
00:33:35,682 --> 00:33:39,061
If you don't stop talkin' to me,
and if you don't stop botherin' me...

410
00:33:39,228 --> 00:33:41,355
or sendin' your sister or your priest
to bother me...

411
00:33:41,522 --> 00:33:42,940
I didn't send me sister
to bother you, did I?

412
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:44,358
She has her own mind.

413
00:33:44,525 --> 00:33:46,360
Although, I did send the priest though,
you have me there.

414
00:33:46,527 --> 00:33:48,445
What I've decided to do is this.

415
00:33:48,946 --> 00:33:50,739
I have a set of shears at home.

416
00:33:51,156 --> 00:33:53,742
And each time you bother me
from this day on...

417
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,744
I'll take those shears...

418
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:57,663
and I'll take one of me fingers off
with them.

419
00:33:58,497 --> 00:34:00,082
And I'll give that finger to ya.

420
00:34:00,249 --> 00:34:02,751
A finger from me left hand. Me fiddle hand.

421
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:05,170
And each day you bother me more...

422
00:34:05,337 --> 00:34:06,839
another I'll take off and I'll give ya...

423
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:09,341
until you see sense enough to stop.

424
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:11,677
Or until I have no fingers left.

425
00:34:12,553 --> 00:34:14,471
Does this make things clearer to ya?

426
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:17,266
Not really, no.

427
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:19,601
Because I don't want
to hurt your feelings, Pádraic.

428
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:20,811
I don't, like.

429
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:24,106
But it feels like the drastic
is the only option left open to me.

430
00:34:24,273 --> 00:34:26,650
You've loads of options left open to ya.

431
00:34:26,817 --> 00:34:28,610
How's fingers the first port of call?

432
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:32,531
Please, don't talk to me...

433
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:35,659
no more, Pádraic.
Please.

434
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:37,786
- I'm begging you.
- But...

435
00:34:37,953 --> 00:34:39,413
Shush, like, Pádraic.

436
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,790
- Just, you know, shush, like.
- Yeah, I'd shush, like.

437
00:34:41,956 --> 00:34:43,708
I will shush.

438
00:34:46,128 --> 00:34:50,799
Except me and me sister were thinking
you might just be a bit depressed, Colm.

439
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:55,387
And I tell you this much,
fingers just confirms it.

440
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:59,183
Don't you think, Colm?

441
00:35:00,893 --> 00:35:02,603
Starting from now.

442
00:35:21,038 --> 00:35:22,122
Well, I never heard the like.

443
00:35:22,331 --> 00:35:24,917
I never heard the like.
He must really not like you, Pádraic.

444
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:26,251
Fingers!

445
00:35:26,418 --> 00:35:27,753
Jesus. He's serious, lads.

446
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,921
He is serious!

447
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:30,714
You can see it in his eyes he's serious.

448
00:35:30,881 --> 00:35:32,508
Just because he thinks you're dull.

449
00:35:32,674 --> 00:35:33,842
That's going overboard!

450
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:35,761
Who told you about the dull?

451
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:40,015
Well, I overheard it.
Like, what was I supposed to do?

452
00:35:40,182 --> 00:35:41,683
I don't think you're dull.

453
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,894
And jeez,
if I was to cut something off meself...

454
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:47,439
for every dull person that came in here,
I'd only have me head left.

455
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:48,941
Do you think I'm dull, Gerry?

456
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:50,150
No.

457
00:35:51,902 --> 00:35:52,903
That said...

458
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,032
I did think the two of ye
always made a funny pairing, like.

459
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:59,117
- No, we didn't.
- Yeah, ye did.

460
00:35:59,284 --> 00:36:00,953
Ye did. Obviously, ye did.

461
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,705
'Cause now he'd rather maim himself
than talk to ya.

462
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:05,958
Colm was always more of a thinker.

463
00:36:07,042 --> 00:36:08,794
Why's every...
I think.

464
00:36:08,961 --> 00:36:09,920
You don't, Pádraic.

465
00:36:10,087 --> 00:36:11,630
- You don't, Pádraic.
- Your sister does.

466
00:36:11,797 --> 00:36:13,632
- Your sister does, aye. Siobhán does.
- You're more of a...

467
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:15,175
You're more of a...
What is he?

468
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:17,094
You're more one of life's good guys.

469
00:36:17,261 --> 00:36:20,597
You're more one of life's good guys, aye.
Apart from when you're drunk.

470
00:36:20,764 --> 00:36:22,432
Apart from when you're drunk, aye.

471
00:36:23,141 --> 00:36:25,769
I used to think that'd
be a nice thing to be.

472
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:28,063
One of life's good guys.

473
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,774
And now, it sounds like
the worst thing I ever heard.

474
00:36:30,941 --> 00:36:32,150
Don't take it like that, Pádraic.

475
00:36:32,317 --> 00:36:34,069
Don't take it like that, Pádraic.

476
00:36:34,236 --> 00:36:35,612
We're on your side.

477
00:36:49,543 --> 00:36:51,295
What are you smiling at?

478
00:37:15,235 --> 00:37:18,488
What's this mope so mopey for?
He's just a fecking man, lads!

479
00:37:18,655 --> 00:37:20,157
A fat, ginger man!

480
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:22,201
Ay yi yi.

481
00:37:22,618 --> 00:37:25,412
I'll tell ya this much.
Ye two are awful mopey hosts.

482
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:28,040
Luckily, you won't have to put up with us
more than one night, so...

483
00:37:28,207 --> 00:37:29,750
and try eatin' with your mouth closed.

484
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:31,251
Where are we now, France?

485
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:32,711
Will you tell him, Pádraic?

486
00:37:32,878 --> 00:37:35,172
Aye, stop being
a little fecking bollocks, Dominic.

487
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:37,382
No. Just about the mouth thing.

488
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:41,929
Colm Doherty and his fat fecking fingers.

489
00:37:42,095 --> 00:37:44,681
He probably wouldn't even be able
to cut through the blubber on them fingers.

490
00:37:45,474 --> 00:37:47,976
Would you not want him to have to do the
one finger to see if he was bluffing, like?

491
00:37:48,352 --> 00:37:49,353
No, we wouldn't.

492
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,940
That's what I'd have him do, I'd have him
do the one finger to see if he was bluffin'.

493
00:37:53,106 --> 00:37:54,107
'Cause worst comes to worst...

494
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:56,568
he can still play the fiddle
with four fingers, I'll bet ya.

495
00:37:56,735 --> 00:37:57,778
Or the banjo.

496
00:37:58,278 --> 00:38:00,864
We don't want any of that. We just
want nothing to do with him no more.

497
00:38:01,031 --> 00:38:02,908
You don't.
This gom does.

498
00:38:03,617 --> 00:38:04,952
I am a gom, is right.

499
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:06,662
You're not a gom!

500
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:09,790
Jeez.

501
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:11,750
This is a depressing house.

502
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:14,294
Would you prefer your own, so?

503
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:16,255
I've heard it's a barrel of fecking laughs.

504
00:38:17,005 --> 00:38:18,715
Well, touché.

505
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:20,342
Too what?

506
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:23,136
Ché. Touché.
It's from the French.

507
00:38:35,983 --> 00:38:38,360
And how is it, Siobhán,
that you was never married?

508
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:45,742
It's none of your fecking business
how I was never fecking married.

509
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:46,910
How isn't it?

510
00:38:47,703 --> 00:38:48,996
How isn't it?

511
00:38:49,746 --> 00:38:50,873
Was you never wild?

512
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:54,501
Wild? Was I never wild?

513
00:38:55,544 --> 00:38:57,212
I don't know
what you're talkin' about, Dominic.

514
00:38:57,379 --> 00:38:59,506
Wild, how? Angry?

515
00:38:59,673 --> 00:39:01,341
'Cause I'm gettin'
angry now, I can tell ya!

516
00:39:01,508 --> 00:39:02,885
Not angry. Wild.

517
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:04,636
You just keep sayin' wild, Dominic!

518
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:06,388
- Wild!
- My brother told you, didn't he?

519
00:39:06,555 --> 00:39:09,433
That you'd be out in the road
if you started talking stupid to me?

520
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,684
He said creepy, not stupid.

521
00:39:10,851 --> 00:39:12,936
Well, you've failed on both counts,
haven't ya?

522
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:14,104
I have.

523
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:18,483
I'm off to bed and he's not stayin' here
another night, Pádraic.

524
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:22,112
I don't care how depressed you are.
I'd rather have the donkey in.

525
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:28,827
Foiled again.

526
00:39:29,453 --> 00:39:31,371
But "faint heart" and all that.

527
00:39:40,088 --> 00:39:41,089
Here.

528
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:45,302
Ye two, ye'll be all right.

529
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:48,096
Will we be?

530
00:40:37,646 --> 00:40:39,147
Hello there, Mrs. O'Riordan,
I've the milk outside for ya.

531
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:40,858
So, it's the two weeks
you owe me for now, I think.

532
00:40:41,024 --> 00:40:45,028
Nobody has a lick of news for us
from your side of the island, Pádraic.

533
00:40:45,195 --> 00:40:46,446
Are you going to be the same as them?

534
00:40:46,613 --> 00:40:49,700
I am, Mrs. O'Riordan, I'm afraid.
And I'm in a bit of a rush, so...

535
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:52,870
Eileen Coughlan had no news.

536
00:40:53,036 --> 00:40:55,372
Vincent Shaughnessy had no news.

537
00:40:55,539 --> 00:40:57,958
It was a poor old week for news.
But then it is, sometimes.

538
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:01,295
ColmSonnyLarry, he had no news.

539
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:02,504
Did he not?

540
00:41:02,713 --> 00:41:04,423
That man never talks.

541
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,091
- He talks sometimes.
- Up himself.

542
00:41:06,258 --> 00:41:08,927
Aye, aye, anyways, so, it's the two weeks
you owe me for now, Mrs. O'Riordan.

543
00:41:09,094 --> 00:41:10,304
As I was sayin'.

544
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,018
Ladies.

545
00:41:16,185 --> 00:41:17,227
It's Peadar.

546
00:41:17,394 --> 00:41:19,396
Peadar always has a rake of news.

547
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:21,732
- What news have you, Peadar?
- News, is it?

548
00:41:22,274 --> 00:41:24,860
Fella killed himself, over Rosmuck way.

549
00:41:25,027 --> 00:41:26,778
Walked into a lake for himself.

550
00:41:26,945 --> 00:41:29,406
Twenty-nine and nothing wrong with him,
the fool.

551
00:41:29,573 --> 00:41:31,033
God love us!

552
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,202
No, not "God love us."
Fool!

553
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:34,494
Another fella...

554
00:41:34,661 --> 00:41:36,079
Protestant, of course...

555
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:38,373
stabbed his missus in Letterkenny.

556
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,917
Six times he stabbed her.

557
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:42,711
Good God!
And did she die, Peadar?

558
00:41:42,878 --> 00:41:44,338
She did die, aye.

559
00:41:44,505 --> 00:41:46,423
It wasn't with a spoon he was stabbin' her.

560
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,008
That's a lot of news.

561
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:51,386
This man has no news, don't ya not?
No-Newsy!

562
00:41:52,804 --> 00:41:54,973
- Stukes never have news.
- Stukes!

563
00:41:55,307 --> 00:41:56,308
Funny.

564
00:41:56,475 --> 00:41:59,186
There was a bit of news
I remembered, Mrs. O'Riordan.

565
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:03,065
Dominic Kearney's father beat
Dominic senseless with a kettle Saturday...

566
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:05,025
and is staying with me and me sister,
Dominic is.

567
00:42:05,192 --> 00:42:07,903
So, at least his father'll take
a bit of a break from his beatin' of him.

568
00:42:08,779 --> 00:42:10,322
And him, a policeman.

569
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:12,199
Isn't that news?

570
00:42:12,908 --> 00:42:15,327
That Dominic's an awful little bollocks.

571
00:42:15,494 --> 00:42:16,495
That's no news.

572
00:42:16,662 --> 00:42:18,997
Still, he was in a bad way
when I came upon him.

573
00:42:19,164 --> 00:42:21,208
I'd beat him with a kettle meself
if I wasn't old.

574
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:22,793
It's news is all I'm sayin'.

575
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,129
That's no news.
That's shite news.

576
00:42:26,296 --> 00:42:28,006
Okay, so, Mrs. O'Riordan, thanks for the...

577
00:42:28,757 --> 00:42:30,342
I'll see ya when I see ya.

578
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:53,782
And you can tell
that skitter of a son of mine...

579
00:42:53,949 --> 00:42:55,117
he'd better be home by teatime...

580
00:42:55,617 --> 00:42:57,619
or it's over to batter
the both of ye I'll be...

581
00:42:57,786 --> 00:42:59,454
and your dreary fecking sister, too!

582
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:11,258
Hello there, Colm.

583
00:43:11,425 --> 00:43:13,927
Will I see you at Jonjo's tonight
for that pint you owe me?

584
00:43:14,094 --> 00:43:15,387
I owe you no...

585
00:43:16,263 --> 00:43:17,264
You will, Peadar.

586
00:43:17,431 --> 00:43:18,765
Good man yourself.

587
00:44:30,838 --> 00:44:31,839
Stand.

588
00:44:32,548 --> 00:44:33,549
Stand.

589
00:46:12,356 --> 00:46:13,690
What's that, Jenny?

590
00:46:15,776 --> 00:46:17,528
Will we go to the pub for ourselves?

591
00:46:19,238 --> 00:46:20,781
We will. Come on.

592
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:40,259
One drink you're havin', lady,
then it's off home with ya.

593
00:46:40,425 --> 00:46:43,011
I've a shirt that wants ironing
for the morning.

594
00:46:44,471 --> 00:46:45,764
Okay, Daddy.

595
00:46:46,265 --> 00:46:49,601
Aye. Off to the mainland in the morning
I'm headin'.

596
00:46:49,768 --> 00:46:51,687
That's why I need the clean shirt, like.

597
00:46:53,564 --> 00:46:55,732
"And why are you off to the mainland
in the mornin', Peadar?"

598
00:46:56,358 --> 00:46:58,277
Thanks for asking, Colm.
I'll tell ya why.

599
00:46:58,694 --> 00:47:02,072
They've asked for extra manpower
for a couple of the executions...

600
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:04,408
in case there's any kind of a to-do, like.

601
00:47:04,575 --> 00:47:06,910
Six bob and a free lunch they're payin' me.

602
00:47:07,077 --> 00:47:08,662
And sure I'd have gone for nothin'.

603
00:47:09,204 --> 00:47:11,915
I've always wanted to see an execution,
haven't you?

604
00:47:12,082 --> 00:47:13,834
Although, I'd have preferred a hanging.

605
00:47:14,001 --> 00:47:15,460
Who are they executin'?

606
00:47:15,627 --> 00:47:18,672
The Free State lads are executin'
a couple of the IRA lads.

607
00:47:20,215 --> 00:47:21,758
Or is it the other way around?

608
00:47:23,385 --> 00:47:25,387
I find it hard to follow these days.

609
00:47:26,221 --> 00:47:28,223
Wasn't it so much easier
when we was all on the same side...

610
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:30,350
and it was just the English we was killin'?

611
00:47:30,517 --> 00:47:32,728
I think it was.
I preferred it.

612
00:47:33,353 --> 00:47:35,272
But you don't care who's executin' who?

613
00:47:35,439 --> 00:47:37,774
For six bob and a free lunch, I don't care!

614
00:47:37,941 --> 00:47:39,776
They could be executin' you.

615
00:47:40,736 --> 00:47:42,279
Why don't you come with me?

616
00:47:42,446 --> 00:47:44,740
You could write
a miserable feckin' song about it.

617
00:47:47,618 --> 00:47:49,328
Nah, I'm only messin'.

618
00:48:14,728 --> 00:48:15,729
Who are them?

619
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:18,273
Music students, I think, from Lisdoonvarna.

620
00:48:30,327 --> 00:48:32,287
Another whiskey, anyways, Jonjo.

621
00:48:33,413 --> 00:48:35,874
Jeez, you're goin' at it
at a fair old lick tonight, Pádraic.

622
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:38,293
Yeah? What's it to ya?

623
00:49:09,241 --> 00:49:10,617
Pádraic, don't now...

624
00:49:14,413 --> 00:49:15,873
Go get Siobhán, Dominic, would ya?

625
00:49:19,918 --> 00:49:21,545
What are you after, gobshite?

626
00:49:21,712 --> 00:49:23,088
Another beatin', is it?

627
00:49:23,255 --> 00:49:25,507
You, copper, I'm allowed
to chat to you, aren't I?

628
00:49:25,674 --> 00:49:27,634
It's just tubbyguts
I'm not allowed to talk to.

629
00:49:27,801 --> 00:49:29,761
Actually, no, I'd rather
you didn't talk to me neither.

630
00:49:31,013 --> 00:49:32,389
Well, anyways...

631
00:49:32,556 --> 00:49:34,975
do you want to know what the three things
that I hate the most...

632
00:49:35,142 --> 00:49:36,393
- on Inisherin is?
- Not really.

633
00:49:36,852 --> 00:49:37,853
One...

634
00:49:38,812 --> 00:49:39,813
policemen.

635
00:49:40,772 --> 00:49:41,773
Two...

636
00:49:42,274 --> 00:49:43,275
pudgy fiddle players.

637
00:49:44,526 --> 00:49:45,819
And three...

638
00:49:46,653 --> 00:49:48,447
Wait, I had some funny thing for three.
What was it?

639
00:49:48,906 --> 00:49:50,949
I'll start again.
One...

640
00:49:51,825 --> 00:49:52,868
policemen.

641
00:49:53,035 --> 00:49:54,328
Two...

642
00:49:55,913 --> 00:49:56,997
Pudgy fiddle players.

643
00:49:57,164 --> 00:49:58,874
Pudgy fiddle players.

644
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:00,417
And shite, what was three?

645
00:50:00,584 --> 00:50:02,794
Go on back to your own gang now, Pádraic.
I'm serious, now.

646
00:50:03,086 --> 00:50:04,213
Serious, are ya?

647
00:50:06,632 --> 00:50:09,092
And talkin' to me, are ya?

648
00:50:11,136 --> 00:50:12,179
Siobhán!

649
00:50:14,932 --> 00:50:17,017
Pádraic's out of his brains on whiskey,
and Colm's there.

650
00:50:17,184 --> 00:50:18,644
You'd better come.

651
00:50:25,651 --> 00:50:28,237
You, Colm Doherty,
do you know what you used to be?

652
00:50:28,403 --> 00:50:30,239
No, Pádraic, what did I used to be?

653
00:50:30,405 --> 00:50:31,532
Nice!

654
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:33,825
You used to be nice!

655
00:50:34,409 --> 00:50:35,494
Didn't he not?

656
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:38,497
And now, do you know what you are?

657
00:50:38,914 --> 00:50:39,915
Not nice.

658
00:50:40,082 --> 00:50:41,083
Well...

659
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:45,128
I suppose niceness doesn't last then,
does it, Pádraic?

660
00:50:45,921 --> 00:50:47,589
But will I tell ya
something that does last?

661
00:50:47,756 --> 00:50:50,467
What? And don't say
somethin' stupid like music.

662
00:50:50,634 --> 00:50:52,511
- Music lasts.
- Knew it!

663
00:50:52,678 --> 00:50:55,472
And paintings last. And poetry lasts.

664
00:50:55,639 --> 00:50:57,558
So does niceness.

665
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:01,603
Do you know who we remember...

666
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:04,022
for how nice they was in the 17th century?

667
00:51:04,189 --> 00:51:06,525
- Who?
- Absolutely no one.

668
00:51:06,692 --> 00:51:09,319
Yet we all remember the music of the time.

669
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,655
Everyone, to a man, knows Mozart's name.

670
00:51:11,822 --> 00:51:13,991
Well, I don't, so there goes that theory.

671
00:51:15,158 --> 00:51:17,619
And anyway, we're talkin' about niceness.

672
00:51:18,161 --> 00:51:19,580
Not whatsisname.

673
00:51:20,706 --> 00:51:23,000
My mammy, she was nice.

674
00:51:23,876 --> 00:51:25,210
I remember her.

675
00:51:26,128 --> 00:51:28,463
And my daddy, he was nice.
I remember him.

676
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:31,133
And my sister, she's nice.

677
00:51:31,508 --> 00:51:34,761
I'll remember her.
Forever I'll remember her.

678
00:51:34,928 --> 00:51:37,222
- And who else will?
- "Who else will" what?

679
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:39,725
Remember Siobhán and your niceness?

680
00:51:40,601 --> 00:51:41,643
No one will.

681
00:51:42,227 --> 00:51:43,228
In 50 years' time...

682
00:51:43,395 --> 00:51:45,564
no one will remember any of us.

683
00:51:47,649 --> 00:51:50,152
Yet the music of a man
who lived two centuries ago...

684
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:52,404
"Yet" he says, like he's English.

685
00:51:53,488 --> 00:51:54,656
Come home, Pádraic.

686
00:51:54,823 --> 00:51:58,118
I don't give a feck about Mozart...

687
00:51:58,702 --> 00:52:00,204
or Borvoven...

688
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:03,081
or any of them funny name feckers.

689
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,292
I'm Pádraic Súilleabháin.

690
00:52:07,377 --> 00:52:08,629
And I'm nice.

691
00:52:09,338 --> 00:52:10,464
Come home.

692
00:52:11,006 --> 00:52:13,592
So you'd rather be friends
with this fella, would ya?

693
00:52:14,051 --> 00:52:14,968
A fella who...

694
00:52:15,135 --> 00:52:18,138
beats his own son black and blue every
night that he's not fiddling with him.

695
00:52:19,765 --> 00:52:22,559
I never told him that, Daddy.
He's just drunk now.

696
00:52:23,185 --> 00:52:24,895
You used to be nice.

697
00:52:26,313 --> 00:52:27,940
Or did you never used to be?

698
00:52:30,776 --> 00:52:31,985
Oh, God.

699
00:52:34,863 --> 00:52:36,949
Maybe you never used to be.

700
00:52:53,423 --> 00:52:57,302
I'll have a word with him, Colm.
You don't need to do anything drastic.

701
00:52:57,469 --> 00:52:59,137
He won't be botherin' you no more.

702
00:52:59,304 --> 00:53:00,597
That's a shame.

703
00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:05,018
That's the most interesting he's ever been.
I think I like him again now.

704
00:53:08,647 --> 00:53:12,192
It was the 18th century, anyway.
Mozart.

705
00:53:12,818 --> 00:53:14,361
Not the 17th.

706
00:53:50,105 --> 00:53:52,983
Siobhán Súilleabháin!
Well, well.

707
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:56,153
I only came in for rashers, Mrs. O'Riordan.
I've no time to talk, I'm afraid.

708
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,696
Letter came for ya.

709
00:54:00,908 --> 00:54:02,409
Fell open, did it?

710
00:54:02,576 --> 00:54:03,994
Aye, in the heat, I suppose.

711
00:54:10,584 --> 00:54:11,877
A job offer, is it?

712
00:54:18,717 --> 00:54:21,803
A job offer from a library
on the mainland, is it?

713
00:54:22,971 --> 00:54:26,600
Just the rashers, please, Mrs. O'Riordan.
About ten of them.

714
00:54:34,691 --> 00:54:36,735
You never tell me anything!

715
00:54:39,154 --> 00:54:40,906
Well, it'd crucify him, your leaving!

716
00:54:41,073 --> 00:54:42,616
Hey, no one's leaving!

717
00:54:57,673 --> 00:54:59,216
Listen, I didn't come down to chat.

718
00:54:59,383 --> 00:55:02,678
I just came down to say that all that last
night was just the whiskey talkin', Colm.

719
00:55:02,845 --> 00:55:03,846
All what last night?

720
00:55:04,012 --> 00:55:05,639
All whatever it was I was sayin'.

721
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:07,266
What were you sayin'?

722
00:55:08,225 --> 00:55:10,102
Yeah. I can't remember much of it...

723
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:12,312
but I remember
the gist of it wasn't the best.

724
00:55:12,896 --> 00:55:14,648
You always know, don't ya?

725
00:55:18,026 --> 00:55:20,779
Well, anyways,
I just wanted to say I was sorry.

726
00:55:20,946 --> 00:55:22,072
Will we leave it at that?

727
00:55:23,866 --> 00:55:25,742
Why can't you just leave me alone, Pádraic?

728
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:30,330
I've already told ya, haven't I?

729
00:55:30,497 --> 00:55:31,915
Yeah, I know. I was just...

730
00:55:32,082 --> 00:55:34,084
I mean, why can't you just leave me alone?

731
00:55:46,513 --> 00:55:48,182
- What are ya doing?
- I don't know.

732
00:55:49,308 --> 00:55:51,018
For fuck's sake, like.

733
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:00,861
How's the new tune?

734
00:56:01,778 --> 00:56:02,821
What?

735
00:56:17,211 --> 00:56:19,338
For God's sake, Pádraic.

736
00:56:19,505 --> 00:56:20,714
How many more times?

737
00:56:20,881 --> 00:56:24,218
I am not putting me donkey outside
when I am sad, okay?

738
00:56:24,384 --> 00:56:27,513
Well, stringy bits of shite I had to
pick up yesterday when ya let her in!

739
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:29,723
There was no stringy bits
in that donkey's shite.

740
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:32,017
There was bits of straw,
if there was anything.

741
00:56:32,184 --> 00:56:34,019
Maybe it was straw, so.

742
00:56:36,355 --> 00:56:38,065
I'll get us our porridge.

743
00:56:57,417 --> 00:56:58,502
Was I awful last night?

744
00:57:01,797 --> 00:57:03,966
No, you was lovely.

745
00:57:04,132 --> 00:57:06,343
Well, I know I wasn't lovely now, Siobhán.

746
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:09,054
You were lovely.
About me, anyways.

747
00:57:09,221 --> 00:57:11,348
Of course I was lovely about you.

748
00:57:12,266 --> 00:57:13,725
What else is there to be about ya?

749
00:58:19,833 --> 00:58:21,126
What was that? A bird?

750
00:58:22,127 --> 00:58:23,128
What was what?

751
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:24,880
The bang at the door.

752
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:26,381
A bird?

753
00:58:26,548 --> 00:58:27,549
- Aye.
- No.

754
00:58:29,176 --> 00:58:30,177
What was it, so?

755
00:58:30,344 --> 00:58:31,595
- The bang at the door?
- Aye!

756
00:58:31,762 --> 00:58:32,679
What was the bang at the door?

757
00:58:33,472 --> 00:58:35,057
It was...

758
00:58:35,516 --> 00:58:36,517
hard to lie...

759
00:58:36,683 --> 00:58:38,602
it was...

760
00:58:39,811 --> 00:58:41,855
a finger.

761
00:58:45,567 --> 00:58:46,568
A what?

762
00:58:46,985 --> 00:58:47,986
Finger.

763
00:58:49,613 --> 00:58:51,031
Jesus, Siobhán!
You'll frighten the little fella!

764
00:58:51,573 --> 00:58:52,574
Throw it out, Pádraic!

765
00:58:52,741 --> 00:58:54,826
I'm not throwing his finger out!
It'll get dirt on it!

766
00:58:58,956 --> 00:59:00,040
Where'd you put it?

767
00:59:01,959 --> 00:59:03,043
Shoebox.

768
00:59:03,544 --> 00:59:05,587
Oh, my. Oh, God.

769
00:59:05,754 --> 00:59:06,755
Well...

770
00:59:07,965 --> 00:59:09,174
he's serious, then.

771
01:00:26,293 --> 01:00:27,377
Do we have to have it in here
while we're eating?

772
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:30,339
Once I finish me porridge,
I'll bring it back to him.

773
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:35,385
Are you feckin' stupid?

774
01:00:35,552 --> 01:00:38,514
I mean, are you feckin' stupid?

775
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,682
No, I'm not feckin' stupid.
We've had this discussion.

776
01:00:40,849 --> 01:00:43,769
You've got to leave him alone now, Pádraic.
For good!

777
01:00:44,811 --> 01:00:45,812
Do you think?

778
01:00:45,979 --> 01:00:48,148
Do I think?
Yeah, I do think!

779
01:00:48,315 --> 01:00:51,109
He's cut his feckin' finger off,
and thrown it at ya!

780
01:00:51,276 --> 01:00:53,195
Come on! It wasn't at me.

781
01:00:55,322 --> 01:00:56,907
Well, what are we going to do?

782
01:00:57,407 --> 01:00:59,493
We can't keep a man's finger.

783
01:01:25,686 --> 01:01:27,563
Jesus, Colm!

784
01:01:28,814 --> 01:01:30,065
Did it hurt?

785
01:01:30,732 --> 01:01:33,402
Hurt awful to begin with.
Thought I was going to faint.

786
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:38,615
It's funny, feels fine now,
in all the excitement.

787
01:01:40,784 --> 01:01:41,910
Would you like a cup of tea?

788
01:01:42,077 --> 01:01:45,247
I won't, Colm. I only came up
to give you your finger back.

789
01:01:45,831 --> 01:01:46,999
Yeah?

790
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:49,585
Thanks.

791
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:53,338
Cleared up quite nice, actually.

792
01:01:53,505 --> 01:01:55,132
And you wouldn't have thought it would.

793
01:01:56,049 --> 01:01:58,385
What do you need from him, Colm?

794
01:01:58,552 --> 01:02:00,053
To end all this?

795
01:02:03,307 --> 01:02:04,766
Silence, Siobhán.

796
01:02:05,517 --> 01:02:07,060
Just silence.

797
01:02:07,978 --> 01:02:12,524
One more silent man on Inisherin, good-oh!

798
01:02:12,691 --> 01:02:14,234
Silence it is, so.

799
01:02:16,653 --> 01:02:18,447
This isn't about Inisherin.

800
01:02:18,947 --> 01:02:21,867
It's about one boring man
leaving another man alone, that's all.

801
01:02:22,034 --> 01:02:25,662
"One boring man"!
You're all fecking boring!

802
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:28,457
With your piddling grievances over nothin'!

803
01:02:28,624 --> 01:02:31,460
You're all fecking boring!

804
01:02:32,544 --> 01:02:34,838
I'll see he doesn't talk to you no more.

805
01:02:35,005 --> 01:02:36,006
Do.

806
01:02:36,965 --> 01:02:40,302
Else it'll be all four of them
the next time, not just the one.

807
01:02:41,386 --> 01:02:42,888
You're not serious.

808
01:02:45,265 --> 01:02:47,559
Well, that won't help your fecking music.

809
01:02:48,352 --> 01:02:49,353
Aye.

810
01:02:49,978 --> 01:02:51,480
We're gettin' somewhere now.

811
01:02:54,816 --> 01:02:57,569
I think you might be ill, Colm.

812
01:02:59,029 --> 01:03:02,115
Do worry sometimes
I'm just entertaining meself...

813
01:03:02,658 --> 01:03:04,576
while I stave off the inevitable.

814
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,704
Don't you?

815
01:03:09,957 --> 01:03:11,750
No, I don't.

816
01:03:14,378 --> 01:03:15,629
Yeah, you do.

817
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:53,644
Declan!

818
01:05:40,858 --> 01:05:41,900
Howdo!

819
01:05:42,776 --> 01:05:43,735
Howdo!

820
01:05:43,902 --> 01:05:45,070
Do you want a ride?

821
01:05:46,697 --> 01:05:47,906
I will so.

822
01:05:48,073 --> 01:05:49,283
Thanks, fella!

823
01:05:58,458 --> 01:06:01,253
Oh, no, you're not that student fella
from Lisdoonvarna, are ya?

824
01:06:01,753 --> 01:06:03,213
I am. I'm Declan.

825
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:05,174
Why?

826
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:06,633
They told me at the post office
to try to find...

827
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:09,011
that student fella, Declan,
from Lisdoonvarna.

828
01:06:09,178 --> 01:06:10,762
Yeah, a telegram came for ya.

829
01:06:10,929 --> 01:06:12,264
From your mammy.

830
01:06:12,764 --> 01:06:14,433
My mammy is no longer with us.

831
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,185
Not your mammy, sorry.

832
01:06:16,727 --> 01:06:18,729
Did I say your mammy?
Your auntie. Yeah, your auntie.

833
01:06:18,896 --> 01:06:20,189
It's about your daddy.

834
01:06:20,355 --> 01:06:21,607
What about Daddy?

835
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:24,776
Bread van crashed into him.

836
01:06:24,943 --> 01:06:26,653
- The bread van?
- Yeah.

837
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:29,114
They said you'd best hurry home to him,
lest he should die all alone.

838
01:06:29,781 --> 01:06:30,782
Die?

839
01:06:30,949 --> 01:06:33,368
Or get worse, all alone.

840
01:06:35,412 --> 01:06:36,663
This is impossible.

841
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:38,290
It's not impossible.

842
01:06:38,457 --> 01:06:40,792
- Bread vans crash into people all the time.
- I know!

843
01:06:42,044 --> 01:06:43,712
That's how me mammy died.

844
01:06:48,717 --> 01:06:51,553
If it's the same fecking bread van,
I'll kill them.

845
01:07:08,153 --> 01:07:09,154
Thanks.

846
01:07:11,448 --> 01:07:13,367
What were you talking
to the boat fella for?

847
01:07:13,534 --> 01:07:15,827
For none of your fecking business,
I think it was.

848
01:07:15,994 --> 01:07:18,163
Of course, it's me business.
Aren't I the law?

849
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:19,623
Fecking knob.

850
01:07:21,208 --> 01:07:22,751
Well, you can tell
that whiny brother of yours...

851
01:07:22,918 --> 01:07:25,128
I'll be around soon
for that battering I owe him.

852
01:07:25,295 --> 01:07:26,380
A battering?

853
01:07:26,922 --> 01:07:29,508
That'd be good, actually.
It might take him out of himself.

854
01:07:31,134 --> 01:07:33,262
You're an awful strange lady.

855
01:07:33,971 --> 01:07:35,556
No wonder no one likes ya.

856
01:08:05,169 --> 01:08:06,670
Hello, there, Mrs. McCormick.

857
01:08:06,837 --> 01:08:11,133
A death shall come to Inisherin
afore the month is out.

858
01:08:11,592 --> 01:08:12,926
A death, huh?

859
01:08:13,302 --> 01:08:15,971
Maybe even two deaths.

860
01:08:16,721 --> 01:08:18,055
Well, that'd be sad.

861
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,727
We shall pray to the Lord...

862
01:08:21,894 --> 01:08:25,479
'tis neither you, nor poor Siobhán,
will be either of them.

863
01:08:26,398 --> 01:08:28,317
Well, is that a nice thing to be sayin'?

864
01:08:28,483 --> 01:08:30,611
I wasn't trying to be nice.

865
01:08:31,569 --> 01:08:33,863
I was trying to be accurate.

866
01:08:38,076 --> 01:08:39,620
Fecking hell.

867
01:09:12,109 --> 01:09:13,819
What's the matter?

868
01:09:15,531 --> 01:09:16,907
Nothing.

869
01:09:51,191 --> 01:09:52,442
Me daddy say he's gonna kill you Sunday...

870
01:09:53,026 --> 01:09:55,070
for spilling the beans
about that fiddling with me.

871
01:09:59,741 --> 01:10:01,493
"Kill me," kill me, or you know...

872
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:03,412
"beat me up a bit," kill me?

873
01:10:04,329 --> 01:10:06,790
"Beat you up a bit," kill ya, I think.

874
01:10:06,957 --> 01:10:08,917
Although he did kill a man once.

875
01:10:13,088 --> 01:10:15,340
I'm sorry for that
spilling the beans on ya, Dominic.

876
01:10:16,133 --> 01:10:18,051
I was out of order that night.

877
01:10:18,218 --> 01:10:19,553
You was funny apart from that bit.

878
01:10:21,054 --> 01:10:24,141
That's why I don't understand
why that fat fella threw the finger at ya.

879
01:10:24,308 --> 01:10:25,934
He seemed fine when you were slagging him.

880
01:10:26,101 --> 01:10:27,477
He did not.

881
01:10:27,644 --> 01:10:28,645
Did he?

882
01:10:28,812 --> 01:10:32,357
"That's the most interesting
Pádraic's ever been," he said.

883
01:10:33,734 --> 01:10:35,027
"I think I like him again now."

884
01:10:40,532 --> 01:10:41,700
Aye.

885
01:10:43,577 --> 01:10:47,289
Maybe this whole thing has just been about
gettin' you to try a new tack...

886
01:10:47,456 --> 01:10:49,208
start standin' up for yourself a bit.

887
01:10:50,167 --> 01:10:51,168
Do you think?

888
01:10:51,376 --> 01:10:53,587
Yeah, and be less of a, you know...

889
01:10:54,129 --> 01:10:55,255
whiny little dull-arse.

890
01:10:57,216 --> 01:10:59,384
Well, I have been
less of a whiny little dull-arse, actually.

891
01:10:59,551 --> 01:11:00,636
Have ya, yeah?

892
01:11:00,802 --> 01:11:04,556
Just yesterday, there was this musician
fella that Colm was getting along great with.

893
01:11:04,723 --> 01:11:07,226
And what did I do? I went and
sent him packing from the island.

894
01:11:07,935 --> 01:11:09,436
Did ya? How?

895
01:11:09,603 --> 01:11:11,230
I told him a bread van
crashed into his daddy...

896
01:11:11,396 --> 01:11:13,815
and he'd have to be rushing home to him,
lest he die.

897
01:11:21,949 --> 01:11:23,909
That sounds like the meanest thing
I've ever heard.

898
01:11:27,037 --> 01:11:30,749
Well, aye, it was a bit mean, but...

899
01:11:32,209 --> 01:11:35,462
he'll be fine once he gets home and he finds
his daddy hasn't been hit by a bread van.

900
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:40,717
I used to think you
were the nicest of them.

901
01:11:42,594 --> 01:11:44,179
Turns out you're just the same as them.

902
01:11:44,346 --> 01:11:45,889
I am the nicest of them.

903
01:11:48,809 --> 01:11:49,935
Dominic, now!

904
01:11:52,729 --> 01:11:55,065
Well, maybe I'm not a happy lad, so!

905
01:11:56,859 --> 01:11:58,694
Maybe this is the new me!

906
01:12:00,946 --> 01:12:01,947
Aye.

907
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:05,033
Maybe this is the new me.

908
01:12:39,526 --> 01:12:40,527
Howdo!

909
01:12:40,694 --> 01:12:42,446
Jesus Christ, Dominic!

910
01:12:42,613 --> 01:12:44,323
Would you ever stop creeping up on people?

911
01:12:44,489 --> 01:12:46,617
You almost gave me a fecking heart attack!

912
01:12:46,783 --> 01:12:47,784
I wasn't creeping up on ya.

913
01:12:47,951 --> 01:12:48,952
I was sidling up on ya.

914
01:12:49,119 --> 01:12:51,121
Between you and that ghoul, Jesus!

915
01:12:51,288 --> 01:12:53,665
I always call her a ghoul, too,
because she is a ghoul.

916
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:56,668
Jeez, we have a lot in common, don't we?
Me and you.

917
01:12:56,835 --> 01:12:59,087
Calling old people ghouls and that.

918
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:04,885
It's a great old lake, isn't it?

919
01:13:09,765 --> 01:13:11,308
I'm glad I caught you, actually.

920
01:13:11,975 --> 01:13:14,645
Because there was somethin'
I was wantin' to ask ya, actually.

921
01:13:14,811 --> 01:13:17,689
And discovering how much
we have in common...

922
01:13:17,856 --> 01:13:20,025
well, it just makes me
want to ask you even more.

923
01:13:20,692 --> 01:13:21,944
We don't have anything in common.

924
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:23,570
Don't skip ahead.

925
01:13:24,571 --> 01:13:26,865
But yeah, what I was wantin'
to ask you was...

926
01:13:28,951 --> 01:13:30,410
Somethin' along the lines of...

927
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:32,538
Should've planned this, really.

928
01:13:33,664 --> 01:13:35,666
Well, yeah,
what I was wantin' to ask you was...

929
01:13:40,587 --> 01:13:43,423
You probably wouldn't ever want to,
I don't know...

930
01:13:44,591 --> 01:13:46,718
to fall in love with a
boy like me, would ya?

931
01:13:49,638 --> 01:13:51,807
Dominic, I don't think so, love.

932
01:13:52,558 --> 01:13:55,519
No, yeah, no. I was thinking no.

933
01:13:58,355 --> 01:14:01,191
Not even in the future, like?
Like when I'm your age?

934
01:14:08,657 --> 01:14:11,159
Yeah, no, I didn't think so.

935
01:14:12,202 --> 01:14:14,329
Just thought I'd ask on the off chance,
you know...

936
01:14:14,496 --> 01:14:16,164
like, "faint heart" and that.

937
01:14:22,462 --> 01:14:24,256
Well, there goes that dream.

938
01:14:30,429 --> 01:14:31,430
Well...

939
01:14:32,306 --> 01:14:35,851
I best go over there and do whatever
that thing over there I was gonna do was.

940
01:14:54,828 --> 01:14:57,706
<i>I walked from Mallow Town</i>

941
01:14:57,873 --> 01:15:00,626
<i>To Aghadoe, Aghadoe</i>

942
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:04,755
<i>I took his head from
the jail gate to Aghadoe</i>

943
01:15:04,922 --> 01:15:06,465
Come on, Sammy, you have to dance too.

944
01:15:08,884 --> 01:15:11,970
<i>Like an Irish king he sleeps in Aghadoe</i>

945
01:15:14,097 --> 01:15:15,474
How are you, fatty?

946
01:15:15,641 --> 01:15:16,892
Dancing with your dog, is it?

947
01:15:17,059 --> 01:15:19,645
Well, who else is gonna dance with ya?
Your poor dog has no say in the matter.

948
01:15:19,811 --> 01:15:22,064
And if you're too rude
to be offering me a seat...

949
01:15:22,231 --> 01:15:24,358
I'll be taking one of me own accord!

950
01:15:26,151 --> 01:15:28,529
Now, how's that for an old hello?

951
01:15:28,695 --> 01:15:30,572
Have you gone fecking mental?

952
01:15:30,739 --> 01:15:32,616
Have I gone fecking mental?

953
01:15:32,783 --> 01:15:36,245
No, I haven't gone
fecking mental, actually.

954
01:15:36,411 --> 01:15:38,205
Not only have I not gone fecking mental...

955
01:15:38,372 --> 01:15:40,874
but I have ten fingers to prove
I've not gone fecking mental.

956
01:15:41,041 --> 01:15:43,293
How many fingers do you have to prove
you've not gone fecking mental?

957
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:44,461
Nine fingers.

958
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:47,130
And nine fingers is the epitome of mental.

959
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:49,842
That's right. The epitome!

960
01:15:51,301 --> 01:15:54,137
There'll be none of that!
I didn't come here for licks!

961
01:15:54,304 --> 01:15:55,305
I came here for the opposite of licks.

962
01:15:55,472 --> 01:15:56,515
What's the opposite of licks?

963
01:15:58,642 --> 01:15:59,893
What did you come here for?

964
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:01,854
I didn't come here for anythin', did I?

965
01:16:02,688 --> 01:16:04,439
I just came to kick your door in
and give you a slagging.

966
01:16:04,606 --> 01:16:06,108
Well, you've done that, so you can go now.

967
01:16:06,275 --> 01:16:07,526
Haven't finished yet, have I?

968
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:11,530
Well, I finished with your door.
I haven't finished with your slagging.

969
01:16:11,947 --> 01:16:14,074
We were doin' so well, Pádraic.

970
01:16:14,241 --> 01:16:16,076
I wasn't doing so well.

971
01:16:18,662 --> 01:16:19,955
I was doing terrible.

972
01:16:20,455 --> 01:16:22,291
All right, I was doin' so well.

973
01:16:22,457 --> 01:16:24,459
Yeah, well, it can't all be you, you, you,
can it?

974
01:16:24,626 --> 01:16:25,919
Yes, it can.

975
01:16:26,336 --> 01:16:28,130
- There's two of us in this.
- No, there isn't.

976
01:16:28,297 --> 01:16:29,548
It takes two to tango.

977
01:16:29,715 --> 01:16:31,216
I don't want to tango.

978
01:16:31,383 --> 01:16:33,510
Well, you danced with your dog.

979
01:16:45,147 --> 01:16:48,442
Talkin' of tangos,
how's your new tune comin' along?

980
01:16:49,443 --> 01:16:51,069
I just finished it, actually.

981
01:16:51,695 --> 01:16:52,696
Just this morning.

982
01:16:53,947 --> 01:16:55,699
No, Colm, that's great, like!

983
01:16:55,866 --> 01:16:58,118
That's why I was dancing with me dog.

984
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:00,787
I don't usually dance with me dog.

985
01:17:00,954 --> 01:17:02,998
There's no harm dancin' with your dog.

986
01:17:03,957 --> 01:17:07,377
I'd dance with me donkey if I knew how.
And she did.

987
01:17:09,671 --> 01:17:10,881
Is it good?

988
01:17:11,048 --> 01:17:12,257
Your tune?

989
01:17:16,553 --> 01:17:18,180
What's it called?

990
01:17:19,181 --> 01:17:22,100
"The Banshees of
Inisherin," I was thinking.

991
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:26,480
But there are no banshees on Inisherin.

992
01:17:27,147 --> 01:17:29,399
I know, I just like the double S.H. sounds.

993
01:17:30,859 --> 01:17:31,860
Aye.

994
01:17:32,569 --> 01:17:35,030
There's plenty of double S.H. on Inisherin.

995
01:17:35,197 --> 01:17:36,198
Yeah.

996
01:17:36,365 --> 01:17:38,408
Maybe there are banshees, too.

997
01:17:39,576 --> 01:17:43,288
I just don't think that they scream
to portend death anymore.

998
01:17:43,455 --> 01:17:48,126
I think they just sit back, amused,
and observe.

999
01:17:48,836 --> 01:17:50,087
Portend?

1000
01:17:51,129 --> 01:17:52,130
Yeah.

1001
01:17:55,092 --> 01:17:57,886
I keep having thoughts
about playing it for you at your funeral.

1002
01:17:58,053 --> 01:18:00,514
But that wouldn't be fair on either of us,
would it?

1003
01:18:14,152 --> 01:18:16,780
Well, that's great
that you finished your tune, Colm.

1004
01:18:17,364 --> 01:18:18,782
That's more than great.

1005
01:18:22,035 --> 01:18:23,287
That's really great.

1006
01:18:35,507 --> 01:18:38,010
So, do you want to meet me
down the pub, Colm?

1007
01:18:38,969 --> 01:18:40,804
We could celebrate your tune, like.

1008
01:18:47,603 --> 01:18:48,937
Only if you'd like, like.

1009
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:53,025
But I could run up ahead.
Order them in.

1010
01:18:56,153 --> 01:18:57,821
Why don't you do that, Pádraic?

1011
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:01,408
Why don't I run up...

1012
01:19:03,452 --> 01:19:04,620
and order them?

1013
01:19:06,413 --> 01:19:07,581
Well, I will so.

1014
01:19:11,001 --> 01:19:12,878
Jeez, that went well!
And maybe on the way...

1015
01:19:13,045 --> 01:19:15,380
I can find that student friend of yours,
that Declan fella!

1016
01:19:15,547 --> 01:19:17,174
I told him his daddy was dying,
so he'd feck off home...

1017
01:19:17,341 --> 01:19:19,468
and leave us alone,
but there's no need now!

1018
01:19:20,093 --> 01:19:21,595
Sure he could join us.

1019
01:20:14,523 --> 01:20:16,483
What are you sitting over there for
when I'm over here?

1020
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:18,902
Just thought I'd have a sit for meself,
you know.

1021
01:20:20,028 --> 01:20:21,321
Wait for me friend.

1022
01:20:21,488 --> 01:20:23,448
Are you fecking joking me?

1023
01:20:23,615 --> 01:20:25,158
Your four-fingered friend?

1024
01:20:25,325 --> 01:20:26,577
I mean, are you fecking joking me?

1025
01:20:26,743 --> 01:20:28,662
No, I'm not fecking joking ya.

1026
01:20:29,162 --> 01:20:31,290
He just needed a bit of tough love was all.

1027
01:21:05,866 --> 01:21:07,326
Siobhán, do you want a sherry?

1028
01:21:07,492 --> 01:21:09,036
- No.
- Righty-ho.

1029
01:21:10,996 --> 01:21:11,997
What are you doin'?

1030
01:21:12,164 --> 01:21:13,582
- Me?
- Yes, you.

1031
01:21:13,749 --> 01:21:15,250
Nothing. Just drinkin'.

1032
01:21:15,417 --> 01:21:16,960
- Not waitin'?
- Not waitin'.

1033
01:21:17,127 --> 01:21:18,754
Well, he is waitin', Siobhán.
He's waitin' for Colm Doherty.

1034
01:21:18,921 --> 01:21:19,922
I amn't waitin'.

1035
01:21:20,088 --> 01:21:21,340
He just told me he was waitin'.

1036
01:21:21,507 --> 01:21:22,925
Telltale!

1037
01:21:25,677 --> 01:21:29,431
Come home with me, Pádraic.
I've somethin' to discuss with ya.

1038
01:21:29,973 --> 01:21:31,642
You've somethin' to discuss with me?

1039
01:21:32,893 --> 01:21:34,603
That sounds...

1040
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:36,730
I don't want to discuss somethin'.

1041
01:21:36,897 --> 01:21:39,900
Well, ya have to, 'cause I'm leavin'.

1042
01:21:41,235 --> 01:21:42,402
Leavin'?

1043
01:21:45,405 --> 01:21:46,657
Like leavin'?

1044
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:49,451
Like...

1045
01:21:51,245 --> 01:21:52,329
not staying?

1046
01:21:56,834 --> 01:21:57,835
Yeah.

1047
01:22:41,753 --> 01:22:42,754
But what about me?

1048
01:22:42,921 --> 01:22:44,131
What about you?

1049
01:22:44,298 --> 01:22:45,549
I'll have no friends at all left!

1050
01:22:45,716 --> 01:22:47,593
- You'll have Dominic.
- Ah here!

1051
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:49,678
And he's gone off me now, too.

1052
01:22:50,095 --> 01:22:52,389
What kind of a place is it
when the village gom goes off ya?

1053
01:22:53,265 --> 01:22:54,683
And who's gonna do the cookin'?

1054
01:22:54,850 --> 01:22:57,477
That's your first question, isn't it?
"Who's gonna do the cookin'?"

1055
01:22:57,644 --> 01:23:01,231
Well, it wasn't me first question, was it?
"But what about me?" was me first question.

1056
01:23:36,475 --> 01:23:37,684
Pádraic.

1057
01:23:39,603 --> 01:23:40,729
Pádraic!

1058
01:23:44,149 --> 01:23:47,402
Now?
But you can't be leavin' now!

1059
01:23:47,569 --> 01:23:49,613
I can be leavin' now.

1060
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:52,199
I can't be waitin' round
for any more of this madness!

1061
01:23:52,366 --> 01:23:54,576
What the hell did you say to him, Pádraic?

1062
01:23:54,743 --> 01:23:55,953
Nothin' really.

1063
01:23:57,412 --> 01:23:59,748
Well, I'd sort of had a chat
with Dominic earlier.

1064
01:24:00,958 --> 01:24:02,501
And a new sort of...

1065
01:24:02,668 --> 01:24:05,963
you know, standin' up for meself
sort of tack we thought I should try.

1066
01:24:06,129 --> 01:24:07,130
God!

1067
01:24:07,297 --> 01:24:10,092
It was all going fine
until he chopped off all his fingers.

1068
01:24:18,851 --> 01:24:20,853
Me books wouldn't fit.

1069
01:24:21,979 --> 01:24:23,689
Would you look after them for me?

1070
01:24:24,273 --> 01:24:25,983
Don't go, Siobhán.

1071
01:24:26,149 --> 01:24:27,985
They're all I have, really.

1072
01:24:29,903 --> 01:24:31,613
Apart from the obvious.

1073
01:24:39,413 --> 01:24:41,748
You'll be back soon, won't you, Siobhán?

1074
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,626
Oh, Pádraic!

1075
01:24:45,169 --> 01:24:46,962
Don't say, "Oh, Pádraic."

1076
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:49,381
Say yes.

1077
01:28:06,453 --> 01:28:07,788
Jenny.

1078
01:28:47,744 --> 01:28:48,745
Oh.

1079
01:30:53,245 --> 01:30:54,621
I don't want to talk.

1080
01:30:55,497 --> 01:30:57,332
Don't go killin' his dog now.

1081
01:30:57,499 --> 01:30:58,500
And don't be puttin' things in me head...

1082
01:30:58,667 --> 01:30:59,793
that weren't there
in the first feckin' place...

1083
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:01,461
you feckin' nutbag!

1084
01:31:02,963 --> 01:31:04,173
"Nutbag!"

1085
01:31:57,392 --> 01:31:59,186
What would I ever hurt you for?

1086
01:32:01,021 --> 01:32:02,940
You're the only nice thing about him.

1087
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:35,013
How are you, Pádraic?
You're lookin' well.

1088
01:32:42,938 --> 01:32:44,147
That's lovely, lads.

1089
01:32:49,236 --> 01:32:51,154
I don't need your apologies, all right?

1090
01:32:51,822 --> 01:32:53,073
It's a relief to me.

1091
01:32:53,699 --> 01:32:55,325
So, let's just call it quits...

1092
01:32:55,492 --> 01:32:58,161
and agree to go our separate ways,
for good this time.

1093
01:33:01,081 --> 01:33:03,792
Your fat fingers
killed me little donkey today.

1094
01:33:04,001 --> 01:33:06,503
So, no, we won't call it quits.

1095
01:33:07,087 --> 01:33:08,088
We'll call it the start.

1096
01:33:09,256 --> 01:33:10,716
- You're jokin' me.
- Yeah, no.

1097
01:33:10,883 --> 01:33:12,467
I'm not jokin' ya.

1098
01:33:12,843 --> 01:33:14,678
So tomorrow, Sunday...

1099
01:33:14,845 --> 01:33:16,847
God's day, around 2:00...

1100
01:33:17,389 --> 01:33:19,516
I'm going to call up to your house
and I'm gonna set fire to it...

1101
01:33:19,683 --> 01:33:21,768
and hopefully you'll still be inside it.

1102
01:33:22,936 --> 01:33:24,813
But I won't be checkin' either way.

1103
01:33:27,691 --> 01:33:29,484
Just be sure and leave your dog outside.

1104
01:33:30,736 --> 01:33:32,696
I've nothing against that gom.

1105
01:33:34,656 --> 01:33:37,784
Or you can do
whatever's in your power to stop me.

1106
01:33:41,205 --> 01:33:43,248
To our graves we're taking this.

1107
01:33:44,917 --> 01:33:46,627
To one of our graves, anyways.

1108
01:33:48,712 --> 01:33:49,713
Here.

1109
01:33:50,047 --> 01:33:52,007
I've a bone to pick with you, dreary.

1110
01:33:52,174 --> 01:33:53,967
Is that little gobshite of mine
at your place again?

1111
01:33:54,134 --> 01:33:56,011
Leave him, Peadar.
His donkey's just died.

1112
01:33:56,470 --> 01:33:57,596
Did he?

1113
01:33:57,763 --> 01:33:59,264
The little miniature fella?

1114
01:33:59,431 --> 01:34:01,850
Well, Jesus, boys,
I'll tell ya this much...

1115
01:34:13,987 --> 01:34:15,113
Two o'clock.

1116
01:35:16,758 --> 01:35:18,468
I killed a miniature donkey.

1117
01:35:22,598 --> 01:35:24,183
It was by accident...

1118
01:35:27,436 --> 01:35:29,021
but I do feel bad about it.

1119
01:35:31,690 --> 01:35:35,903
Do you think God gives a damn
about miniature donkeys, Colm?

1120
01:35:37,905 --> 01:35:39,198
I fear he doesn't.

1121
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:44,578
And I fear that's where
it's all gone wrong.

1122
01:35:47,122 --> 01:35:48,207
Is that it?

1123
01:35:49,208 --> 01:35:50,459
Is what it?

1124
01:35:51,335 --> 01:35:53,045
Aren't you forgetting a couple of things?

1125
01:35:54,588 --> 01:35:56,673
No, I think I've covered it.

1126
01:35:58,550 --> 01:36:00,969
Wouldn't you say
punching a policeman is a sin?

1127
01:36:01,970 --> 01:36:03,013
Ah here.

1128
01:36:03,847 --> 01:36:05,807
If punching a policeman is a sin...

1129
01:36:05,974 --> 01:36:08,977
we may as well just pack up and go home.

1130
01:36:10,604 --> 01:36:12,898
And self-mutilation is a sin.

1131
01:36:13,857 --> 01:36:15,192
It's one of the biggest.

1132
01:36:15,984 --> 01:36:16,985
Is it?

1133
01:36:17,444 --> 01:36:20,322
Self-mutilation, so you have me there.

1134
01:36:20,489 --> 01:36:21,990
Multiplied by five.

1135
01:36:27,412 --> 01:36:29,248
How's the despair?

1136
01:36:33,836 --> 01:36:35,170
It's back a bit.

1137
01:36:38,131 --> 01:36:40,133
But you're not gonna do anything about it?

1138
01:36:44,388 --> 01:36:46,765
I'm not gonna do anything about it, no.

1139
01:37:01,405 --> 01:37:02,698
<i>Dear Pádraic...</i>

1140
01:37:02,865 --> 01:37:07,035
<i>I am safely ensconced in the mainland
and, Pádraic, it's lovely here.</i>

1141
01:37:07,828 --> 01:37:10,455
<i>There's a river running past my window
as I write...</i>

1142
01:37:10,622 --> 01:37:13,250
<i>and the people already seem
less bitter and mental.</i>

1143
01:37:13,417 --> 01:37:16,837
<i>I'm not sure why, but I think
it's 'cause a lot of them are from Spain.</i>

1144
01:37:17,921 --> 01:37:21,425
<i>Mostly, I wanted to say
there's a spare bed here for you, Pádraic.</i>

1145
01:37:21,592 --> 01:37:25,220
<i>And with the war almost over,
I think there'd be work for ya here.</i>

1146
01:37:25,637 --> 01:37:28,098
<i>Because there's nothing
for you on Inisherin.</i>

1147
01:37:28,265 --> 01:37:30,601
<i>Nothing but more bleakness and grudges...</i>

1148
01:37:30,767 --> 01:37:33,437
<i>and loneliness and spite...</i>

1149
01:37:33,604 --> 01:37:36,440
<i>and the slow passing of time until death.</i>

1150
01:37:36,607 --> 01:37:38,400
<i>And sure, you can do that anywhere.</i>

1151
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:44,448
<i>So come, Pádraic. Leave there.</i>

1152
01:37:44,615 --> 01:37:47,326
<i>Dominic can look after Jenny
and the rest of your animals.</i>

1153
01:37:47,492 --> 01:37:49,620
<i>They could move into the house together.</i>

1154
01:38:22,194 --> 01:38:25,155
<i>So come now, Pádraic, please.</i>

1155
01:38:28,867 --> 01:38:31,161
<i>Before it's all too late.</i>

1156
01:41:21,915 --> 01:41:23,083
<i>Dear Siobhán.</i>

1157
01:41:23,792 --> 01:41:26,044
<i>Obviously,
I don't know what "ensconced" is...</i>

1158
01:41:26,879 --> 01:41:29,673
<i>but I thank you for the offer of
the free bed and the whatnot.</i>

1159
01:41:30,549 --> 01:41:32,885
<i>But I won't be takin' you up on it,
I'm afraid.</i>

1160
01:41:34,136 --> 01:41:36,972
<i>As I told you, me life is on Inisherin.</i>

1161
01:41:37,139 --> 01:41:39,057
{\an8}<i>Me friends, me animals.</i>

1162
01:41:39,224 --> 01:41:40,434
{\an8}JENNY

1163
01:41:42,895 --> 01:41:44,062
<i>Even now as I write...</i>

1164
01:41:44,229 --> 01:41:46,148
<i>little donkey Jenny
is looking at me saying...</i>

1165
01:41:46,315 --> 01:41:48,901
<i>"Please don't go, Pádraic.
We'd miss ya."</i>

1166
01:41:49,067 --> 01:41:51,737
<i>And nuzzling me, the gilly-gooly.</i>

1167
01:41:52,487 --> 01:41:53,864
<i>Get off, Jenny.</i>

1168
01:42:08,295 --> 01:42:09,922
<i>In other news...</i>

1169
01:42:10,088 --> 01:42:12,049
<i>in sadder news, actually...</i>

1170
01:42:12,758 --> 01:42:15,260
<i>I won't be able to ask Dominic anything,
I'm afraid.</i>

1171
01:42:17,513 --> 01:42:19,973
<i>Because they found him in the lake
this morning.</i>

1172
01:42:24,269 --> 01:42:27,314
<i>I suppose he must've slipped
and fell in.</i>

1173
01:42:35,531 --> 01:42:38,325
<i>So, there'd be no one
to take care of the animals, anyway.</i>

1174
01:43:01,723 --> 01:43:03,559
<i>No other news, really.</i>

1175
01:43:12,734 --> 01:43:14,778
<i>Except that I love you, Siobhán.</i>

1176
01:43:15,946 --> 01:43:17,114
<i>And I miss ya.</i>

1177
01:43:19,616 --> 01:43:21,827
<i>And I hope I'll see ya again someday.</i>

1178
01:43:24,538 --> 01:43:26,206
<i>If you ever come back home.</i>

1179
01:43:29,126 --> 01:43:31,253
Come back home, Siobhán.

1180
01:43:36,341 --> 01:43:39,261
<i>Yours sincerely, your loving brother...</i>

1181
01:43:41,388 --> 01:43:42,931
<i>Pádraic Súilleabháin.</i>

1182
01:45:16,984 --> 01:45:18,986
Suppose me house makes us quits.

1183
01:45:20,904 --> 01:45:23,448
If you'd stayed in your house,
that would've made us quits.

1184
01:45:24,032 --> 01:45:26,493
But you didn't, did ya,
so it doesn't, does it?

1185
01:45:38,255 --> 01:45:40,382
I'm sorry about your donkey, Pádraic.

1186
01:45:41,008 --> 01:45:42,426
Honestly, I am.

1187
01:45:45,012 --> 01:45:46,805
I don't fucking care.

1188
01:46:02,696 --> 01:46:05,574
Haven't heard any rifle fire
from the mainland in a day or two.

1189
01:46:06,116 --> 01:46:07,701
I think they're coming to the end of it.

1190
01:46:08,994 --> 01:46:12,122
I'm sure they'll be at it again
soon enough, aren't you?

1191
01:46:14,041 --> 01:46:16,168
Some things there's no movin' on from.

1192
01:46:19,379 --> 01:46:21,131
And I think that's a good thing.

1193
01:46:43,737 --> 01:46:44,905
Pádraic.

1194
01:46:51,036 --> 01:46:53,622
Thanks for lookin' after me dog
for me, anyways.

1195
01:46:59,795 --> 01:47:00,963
Any time.
