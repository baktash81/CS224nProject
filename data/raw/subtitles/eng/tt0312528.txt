1
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:18,369
There are gajillions
of stories of mischief and fun,

2
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:23,040
but to keep things simple,
let's start with just one

3
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:27,920
about a mom and two kids
and a house and a hat

4
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:31,883
that, oddly enough, was worn by a cat.

5
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:36,429
But soon enough
we will get to all that.

6
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:40,433
In the valley that stretches
from this hill to that hill,

7
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,393
a city is nestled.

8
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,730
That city is Anville.

9
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:46,939
Hurry up!
We'll miss the movie!

10
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,065
Any more tutti-frutti?

11
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,108
I'll check.
Thanks!

12
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:53,446
It's a town that's not huge,
but quite big enough

13
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,408
for buyers and sellers
to sell and buy stuff,

14
00:01:57,493 --> 00:02:01,954
from shoes and shirts
and elongated ladders

15
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:06,751
to sailboats and gibble-grated
berry-juice bladders.

16
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:13,090
So our story begins at the
corner of Main and Montroob

17
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,718
in the spotless real estate office

18
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:19,180
run by Hank Humberfloob.

19
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:20,807
Humberfloob Real Estate.

20
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,558
How can we make your dreams come true?

21
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,275
What do you mean, you're leaving?

22
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,318
You're a babysitter.

23
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,153
Babysitters don't leave.
They sit.

24
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:35,947
Baby-leavers leave.

25
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,782
I'm sorry. I really
gotta go, Miss Walden.

26
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,700
Well, I need to come home right away.

27
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:40,785
I forgot.

28
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,328
All right.
Thank you, Amy.

29
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,412
Sorry.

30
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:50,002
Attention, everyone.
It's 9:02.

31
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,338
Staff meeting.
Staff meeting.

32
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,510
First I'd like to welcome aboard

33
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,847
our newest member
of the Humberfloob family,

34
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,932
Jim McFlinnagan!

35
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,142
Mr.
Humberfloob, I wanted to thank you...

36
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,186
Fired.
I beg your pardon?

37
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:08,980
Fired.

38
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,064
But I...

39
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:14,610
Fired!

40
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:26,414
As you know, tonight is our
bimonthly Meet & Greet party.

41
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:29,458
Tonight's host is Joan Walden.

42
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,588
This is where people can
meet our real estate agents

43
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:37,633
in an informal, yet hygienic setting.

44
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:41,178
Mr. Humberfloob, I have
to get home to my kids.

45
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:43,973
Ah, yes.

46
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,852
Your children.

47
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:52,481
Joan, let me make
this perfectly clear.

48
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,860
If your house is as
messy as last time,

49
00:03:57,321 --> 00:04:01,616
you're fired!

50
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,329
That's pretty clear,
Mr. Humberfloob.

51
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,914
Don't worry. I promise,

52
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,333
my kids'll be on their best behavior.

53
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,085
Great.

54
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,548
Humberfloob Real Estate.

55
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,091
How can we make your dreams come true?

56
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,343
Please hold.

57
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:24,639
If you leave Humberfloob's
and turn left onto Main,

58
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:29,018
three miles down
you'll find Lipplapper Lane,

59
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,605
a pleasant-enough street
in a pleasant-enough way

60
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:36,943
where a neighbor greeted neighbor
with a neighborly "Hey!"

61
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,527
- Hey!
- Hey!

62
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:42,990
Here the hedges were hedged,
the weeds were all weeded,

63
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:48,162
and lawns were mowed daily,
twice daily if needed.

64
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:53,042
And at the end of this street,
in a house like any other,

65
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:58,005
something magical would happen
to a sister and her brother.

66
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:10,851
Nevins, stealth mode.

67
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,645
Today's to-do list.

68
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,730
Make to-do list.

69
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,483
Practice coloring.

70
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,319
Research graduate schools.

71
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,072
Be spontaneous.

72
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,492
Create lasting childhood memories.

73
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,453
Amend will.

74
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,749
What is he doing?

75
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:54,603
Make tomorrow's to-do list.

76
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,443
Ladies and gentlemen!

77
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,486
Nevins, your attention, please.

78
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:05,656
You are about to witness the
third most spectacular stunt

79
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:08,117
ever performed under this roof!

80
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,077
Do you know how hard it's getting

81
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:12,163
to tell people that we're related?

82
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:15,124
Relax.
I'll put everything back.

83
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,304
And now, for the indoor stair luge!

84
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,389
Indoor stair luge?

85
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:32,558
I'll have to add this one to my list.

86
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,394
Go have no fun somewhere else.

87
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:39,148
It is showtime!

88
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,411
Oh, my word!

89
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,498
Nevins!

90
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,209
Nevins, come back!

91
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,630
Hey, Mom. What's up?

92
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,969
You are so lucky you
didn't ruin this dress.

93
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:13,224
Mom, I know you're angry, but
there's something you need to know.

94
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,101
This was all Sally's fault.

95
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,227
Really?

96
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,437
And how, exactly,
was it Sally's fault?

97
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,606
Give me a minute.
I'm working on it.

98
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,191
Save it, Conrad.

99
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:26,445
Why today? Why did you have to
pick today to destroy the house?

100
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,280
You know what's happening today.

101
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,157
I tried to tell him, Mom.

102
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,660
"Mom's throwing a very
important party," I said.

103
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,954
"All of her important
clients will be here."

104
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,997
But he went right ahead
and wrecked the house,

105
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,624
and let Nevins get away.

106
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,460
Now, again, I hope
you're going to ground him.

107
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,254
Yes, Sally, for a week,

108
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,505
but that's none of your business.

109
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,006
A week?
Come on. Two days.

110
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:50,469
I asked you to do one thing today,
Conrad, keep the house clean.

111
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:51,929
Do you know how frustrating it is

112
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,432
that you're always doing the
exact opposite of what I say?

113
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,017
Knock, knock, knock.

114
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,228
Someone lose a dog?

115
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:04,567
I found him next door
in my yard, again.

116
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,402
You are a saint.

117
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,655
And here I thought you were only
dating me for my good looks.

118
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,241
Lucky us.
Larry Quinn is here.

119
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,411
Hey-a, sport.
Call me Lawrence. Okay?

120
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,789
You rescued Nevins.
Thanks, Lawrence.

121
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:20,082
It was my pleasure, Sally.

122
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,667
Anything for my little princess.

123
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:22,918
I don't wanna be a princess.

124
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,461
In a constitutional monarchy,

125
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,422
parliament has all the real power.

126
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,092
I see.
Okay, that's great.

127
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,844
Look, pal, be a sport.

128
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,555
Why don't you go
tidy up the living room.

129
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,307
Okay, dude?

130
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,017
I don't have to listen to you, Larry.

131
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,436
Conrad, do what Lawrence says.

132
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,661
Have you given some thought
about the Wilhelm Academy?

133
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:01,373
You mean the Colonel Wilhelm
Military Academy for Troubled Youth?

134
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,918
That's the one, Joan.

135
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,629
I'm not sure it's right for Conrad.

136
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,506
Oh, Joan, Joan.

137
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,718
Joan, Joan, Joan.

138
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,597
I have so much respect for you, Joan.

139
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:20,601
Single mother, career woman,
raising two children on your own,

140
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:24,813
and still finding time to be the best
darned real estate agent in town.

141
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,360
I know how hard it is, Joan.

142
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:30,611
It is hard.

143
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,738
I know.

144
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:36,158
And I know how hard you're trying.

145
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,578
This is a once-in-a-
lifetime proposition,

146
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:40,996
and you must act now.

147
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,415
The Colonel Wilhelm Military
Academy for Troubled Youth

148
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,210
is what we call in the sales
game a win-win scenario.

149
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,753
A top-flight
military school,

150
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:51,006
and it's only eight hours away.

151
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,053
The phone.

152
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,230
I heard what you said.

153
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,816
I'm not going to
military school, Larry.

154
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,734
Look, buddy,

155
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,696
I know I'm not your dad,

156
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,949
and this is probably
really strange for you,

157
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,868
your neighbor's dating your mom.

158
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,538
But here's the thing, son.
Come here.

159
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,374
I don't like you, either.

160
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,751
But I'm gonna marry your mom.

161
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:31,630
And if it was up to me, you'd
be at military school today.

162
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,633
I'm not going to military school.

163
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,635
I think you're gonna love it.

164
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,889
It's just like summer camp,
except with brutal forced marches

165
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,891
and soul-crushing discipline.

166
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,352
And one more thing, it's Lawrence,

167
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,480
you snot-nosed son
of a wonderful woman

168
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,649
who I'm absolutely crazy about!

169
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:51,984
Gosh, I love children!

170
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,736
Joan, I didn't see you there.

171
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,571
Would you be a doll and help me

172
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,281
bring up chairs from the basement?

173
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,117
Nothing would give me more pleasure,
Joan, but I do have to run.

174
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,703
I have a very important
sales conference downtown.

175
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,747
Okay.

176
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,749
Well, I'll see you
at the party tonight.

177
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,083
Sure.

178
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,691
Mom, that guy's a total phony.

179
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:33,734
You can't let Larry...

180
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,194
It's Lawrence, Conrad.

181
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,032
Kate's Catering.
I'm here to do your party tonight.

182
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,409
Hi. Where's Kate?

183
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:43,827
I'm Kate.

184
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,496
Okay.

185
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,581
Right this way, Kate.

186
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,334
Quiet!

187
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,752
Two weeks ago you said you would...

188
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,380
I "specialed" it. See?

189
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,423
Quiet! Nevins!

190
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,802
I said quiet!

191
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,890
Joan Walden Real Estate.

192
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,434
Be it ever so humble,
there's no place like Joan.

193
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,561
This is Mr. Humberfloob.

194
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,397
Hi, Mr. Humberfloob.

195
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,315
Joan, I need you to
come back to the office.

196
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,651
Today?
Yes, Joan.

197
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,069
No problem?

198
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:18,570
No problem at all.

199
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:19,822
Great!

200
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,534
What's going on, Mommy?

201
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:26,453
Mommy has to go back to the office.

202
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,540
I hope Mrs. Kwan can baby-sit.

203
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:30,916
Not Mrs. Kwan!

204
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,548
Hi, Mrs. Kwan.
Hi.

205
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,926
I'm running late. Thanks for
baby-sitting on such short notice.

206
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,177
Yeah.

207
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,138
Okay, Mrs. Kwan.

208
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:46,223
I'll be back in a couple of hours.

209
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,266
Hi.

210
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,103
Conrad's grounded, so no video games.

211
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,980
Sally? Last chance.

212
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:56,150
If you wanna make cupcakes, I can take
you to your friend Ginny's house.

213
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,693
Ginny's not my friend anymore.

214
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,278
Last time we made cupcakes,

215
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,988
she wanted to be the head chef.

216
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,698
I'm the head chef.

217
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,324
What about Denise, then?

218
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,453
She talked back to me, so I ordered
her not to speak to me anymore.

219
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,037
And you don't like bossy?

220
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,664
I won't tolerate it.

221
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,874
Right.

222
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,377
If you're both staying,
remember the rules.

223
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:18,464
No playing ball in
the house, no fighting,

224
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,466
no answering the phone,
"City morgue"...

225
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,551
Mommy, can't I have some rules?

226
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,971
No chewing tobacco.

227
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,182
Thanks, Mom.
You have my word.

228
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:33,395
And absolutely no one sets foot
in the living room, or else.

229
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,314
Or else what?
You're gonna do what Larry said

230
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,191
and send me to military school?

231
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:40,819
Maybe if you'd just behave, I wouldn't
have to consider military school.

232
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:42,905
I wish I could trust you.

233
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,492
I wish I had a different mom.

234
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:50,037
Well, sometimes I wish the same thing.

235
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,812
Good luck with your meeting.

236
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:42,214
Children, would you like to
watch television with me?

237
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,091
We don't have to tell your mother.

238
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,770
Taiwanese parliament.
Taiwanese parliament.

239
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,730
You tell them, Kwi-Chang.

240
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,232
No more big government.

241
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,943
Rip his heart out!

242
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:16,915
Hit me!

243
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:22,713
So they slumped in their chairs,

244
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,673
too glum to complain,

245
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:29,052
and to make matters worse,
it started to rain.

246
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:36,393
They sat in the house
on that cold, cold, wet day

247
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:40,397
with no fun to have
and no games to play.

248
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:44,901
They could just stare out the
window or perhaps get a nap in,

249
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:49,197
and hope that something,
anything might happen.

250
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,949
Quit bothering the fish.

251
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,452
I know.
"Quit bothering the fish."

252
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:54,828
Spit hand!
Gross!

253
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,705
Get that away from me!

254
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,208
Get it away!

255
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,877
Then something went bump.

256
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:02,961
What was that?

257
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,424
How that bump made them jump.

258
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,969
I think it came from the closet.

259
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:43,919
Conrad?

260
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,588
Conrad.

261
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,675
Come on, Conrad.

262
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,182
You shouldn't scare people.

263
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,850
You should've seen
the look on your face.

264
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,602
It was like you saw a monster...

265
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,146
A monster? Where?

266
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,609
That could've gone better.

267
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,535
- What was that?
- I don't know.

268
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,161
Looked like a humongous cat.

269
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,372
"Humongous"?

270
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,959
I prefer the term "big-boned" or "jolly.
" Now, what are we hiding from?

271
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,137
That was a giant cat.

272
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,805
But that's impossible, isn't it?

273
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,807
It's entirely impossible.

274
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,685
You know, I like this
hiding place a lot better.

275
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,645
They'll never find us here.

276
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,232
Scream and run.

277
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,360
And there they go.

278
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,240
Who are you?

279
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,950
Who? Me?

280
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,578
Why, I'm the Cat in the Hat.

281
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,246
There's no doubt about that.

282
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,749
I'm a super-fun-diferous
feline

283
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,334
who's here to make sure that you're...

284
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:11,298
Meeline? Key lime?

285
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,551
Turpentine?

286
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,762
I got nothing.

287
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,638
I'm not so good with the rhyming.

288
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,474
Not really, no.

289
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,436
Look, I'm a cat that can talk.

290
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,354
That should be enough for you people!

291
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,941
I can talk!
I'm a cat! Yes!

292
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,277
Where did you come from?

293
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,281
How do I put this?

294
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,117
When a mommy cat and a daddy cat

295
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:41,119
love each other very much,

296
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:42,412
they decide that...

297
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:44,080
Oh, no, no, no, no.

298
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,082
Where did you come from?

299
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,376
My place!
Where do you think?

300
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,339
No, how did you get here?

301
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,049
I drove!

302
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,343
Look, I've been
here two whole minutes,

303
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,386
and no one has offered me a drink.

304
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,349
Sorry, Mr. Cat.
Would you like some milk?

305
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,518
Milk? No!

306
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:07,354
Lactose intolerant.
Gums up the works.

307
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,565
You'll thank me later.

308
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,696
Hello! Surf's up!

309
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,324
Yeah.

310
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,792
Nice spread you got here.

311
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,044
Homina-homina-homina-homina!

312
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,296
Who is this?

313
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:39,886
That's my mom.

314
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:41,638
Awkward, yeah.

315
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,641
Yes, this place will do quite
nicely, actually. Yeah.

316
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:48,019
Although those
drapes are a train wreck.

317
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,859
And this is the lumpiest
couch I ever sat on.

318
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,570
Who is this dreadfully
uncomfortable woman?

319
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:59,114
Get off her.
That's our baby-sitter.

320
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,408
What the... Baby-sitter?

321
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,702
You don't need one of those, do you?

322
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,543
Let me get this straight.

323
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:15,630
You pay this woman to sit on babies?

324
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,966
That's disgusting!

325
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:20,969
I'd do it for nothing!

326
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:29,895
Now, let's see what the old
phunometer has to say.

327
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:30,896
"Phunometer"?

328
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,606
Yeah. It measures how fun you are.

329
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,280
Hi.

330
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:54,085
Control freak. Yeah.

331
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,837
Now, you.

332
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,758
Hi. How are you?

333
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:12,938
Tap it.

334
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,189
Listen, kid,

335
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,775
you can tap it with a hammer,
it ain't gonna change.

336
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,153
Just as I suspected.

337
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,197
You guys are both out of whack.

338
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,866
You're a control freak,
and you're a rule-breaker.

339
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:25,992
That'll be $700.

340
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:27,994
Who's your insurance carrier?

341
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,496
So, what do we do?

342
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,706
Well, there are two
treatments I'd recommend.

343
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,333
One is a series of painful shots

344
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,377
injected into your
abdomen and kneecap.

345
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,839
And the other
involves a musical number!

346
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:42,384
Me-Me-Me-Meow

347
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,427
How many shots?

348
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:48,056
"How many shots?"
Aren't you precious?

349
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:00,402
Maestro!

350
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,782
I know it is wet

351
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,994
And the sun is not sunny

352
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:14,249
But we can have lots of
good fun that is funny

353
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,668
It's fun to have fun

354
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:22,382
But you got to know how

355
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:29,264
Hair ball.

356
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:35,020
I know lots of good tricks and I'll...

357
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:36,980
Stop this right now!

358
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,857
Who said that?
Me!

359
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,316
Remember? The fish?

360
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:44,195
Came home in a Baggie, loved me
for two weeks, and then nothing!

361
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,447
The fish is talking!

362
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:48,199
Well, sure, he can talk.
But is he saying anything?

363
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,784
No, not really. No.

364
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:53,038
Hey, Socks, can it!
This cat should not be here.

365
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:55,832
He should not be about.
He should not be here when your mother is out.

366
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,834
Come on, kids.
You gonna listen to him?

367
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,669
He drinks where he pees.

368
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,847
There was this cat I knew
back home where I was bred

369
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,767
He never listened to
a single thing his mother said

370
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:16,644
He never used the litter box
He made a mess in the hall

371
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:20,482
That's why they sent him to a
vet To cut off both his ba...

372
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,817
Ba, ba...

373
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,196
Boy, that wasn't fun, fun, fun

374
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,907
He never learns
You can have fun, fun, fun

375
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:29,991
But less is more

376
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,911
They may ship you off to
school so rein it in a little

377
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,705
We can't spell "fun"
without "U" in the middle

378
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,917
Children, this cat is
currently in violation of...

379
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,710
17 of your mother's rules.

380
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:42,420
City morgue!
Eighteen!

381
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:51,387
Olé!

382
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,690
You can juggle work and play
but you have to know the way

383
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:05,527
You can keep or float a wish
like the way I do this fish

384
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:08,404
You can be a happy fella
Someone throw me that umbrella

385
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:10,949
And that rake, that cake
Life's what you make it

386
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:13,118
So have fun, fun, fun

387
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:16,037
Go insane and have some fun, fun, fun

388
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,873
Just look at me Fun, fun, fun

389
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,543
No more rain
Look, it's the sun, sun, sun

390
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,045
So can't you see
I'm as happy as a clam

391
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,463
I'm as fit as a fiddle

392
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:27,215
Yeah, the dogs may bark about you

393
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:28,967
And the purebred chaps may doubt you

394
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,760
Getting motion sickness!

395
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,138
Milk? Big mistake.

396
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,432
But remember this You can't
have fun without "U"...

397
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:37,892
I can't breathe!

398
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:43,148
I knew that milk would
come back to haunt me.

399
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:44,399
Help! Help!

400
00:24:53,993 --> 00:25:00,290
"U" in the middle

401
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,336
Bravo, Cat.

402
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,547
Huh? These children are smart enough

403
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,257
not to fall for
your MTV-style flash

404
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,926
at the expense of
content and moral values.

405
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,511
That was wicked cool.

406
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,971
Do it again.

407
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:18,308
I'd love to, but Shamu is right.
I really should be going.

408
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:19,350
No, don't go.

409
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:21,144
No, I should go.

410
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:24,189
I should let you and the fish have
all your fun conjugating verbs,

411
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:26,357
cleaning your room,
doing long division.

412
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:28,568
No, you have to stay.

413
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:30,904
All right, I'll stay.
Oh, yeah!

414
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:31,946
Yeah!

415
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:35,283
But if I'm gonna stay, there's
something I wanna show you.

416
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:39,787
Something magical and full of wonder.

417
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,249
It's called a contract.

418
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,043
You want us to sign this?

419
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:47,212
Just a formality, really.
Yeah.

420
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:48,713
Who are they?

421
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,051
Magical time-traveling elves.

422
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,887
Yeah. Magic.

423
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,059
Okay, they're my lawyers.

424
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:03,228
Liability issues, litigious society,

425
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,396
frivolous lawsuits.
You understand.

426
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,232
Basically, this contract guarantees

427
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:09,025
you can have all the fun you want,

428
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,486
and nothing bad's ever gonna happen.

429
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,570
All the fun we want?

430
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:13,655
Yeah.

431
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:14,822
Nothing bad will happen?

432
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:15,990
No.

433
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:20,370
Come on, Sal, for once in your
life try something spontaneous.

434
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,333
It goes against my
better instincts, but...

435
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:28,753
Fine.

436
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,546
Beautiful. Initial here.

437
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:32,840
And here. And here.

438
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,175
Not here!

439
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,262
Turn it over.

440
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:39,681
This is nothing.

441
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,225
Scratch this.

442
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:43,851
Smell that! Terrific.

443
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,853
Yadee-yadee-yadee.

444
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,397
Sign the bottom.

445
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,359
Great! Okay, gimme five!

446
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:55,363
Four.

447
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,702
Let's get this party started!

448
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,329
Hey, check out this room!

449
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:06,416
What now?

450
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,460
Mom says we're not allowed in
the living room today, or else.

451
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,129
She's worried
we'll mess up the couches

452
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:12,880
by jumping on 'em or something.

453
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:16,259
And she's right.
You can't jump on these.

454
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,803
Not like this.
They need some adjustment.

455
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:25,226
Let's take a look under the hood.

456
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:27,979
Yeah.

457
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,231
Use my jack.

458
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:32,191
Sorry.

459
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:34,193
What have we got here?
Whew.

460
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,489
Here we go.

461
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,993
It's over-sized.
That's unusual.

462
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,703
Here it is.

463
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:49,292
Down, Simba! Down, Simba!
Get out of here!

464
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,421
Spray me, would you?
You...

465
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:08,978
Thanks for the help.

466
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,357
Back in a second.

467
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,067
Who's your couch mechanic?

468
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:16,569
You ought to
call Mr. Catwrench.

469
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:20,573
My fur! My fur! My fur!

470
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:27,163
That ought to do it.
Whoo!

471
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:44,305
Come on, kids.
I could use a little company.

472
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,015
What about Mom's party?

473
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,101
What about it?
We signed the contract.

474
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,399
One cushion left, Sally.

475
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:57,235
She'll never do it.
She doesn't know how to have fun.

476
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:00,238
Fun? Sally,
you're better than fun.

477
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,281
Fun is beneath you.

478
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,741
Remember what your mother told you.

479
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:06,577
No one sets foot in the living room...

480
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:09,414
You know what?
Let's just watch some flashbacks.

481
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:14,544
Absolutely no one sets foot
in the living room, or else.

482
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:20,466
You're fired, fired,
fired, fired, fired, fired,

483
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,970
fired, fired, fired...

484
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,305
And that's why...

485
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:33,104
This is where they buried my brother!

486
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,480
Yeah!

487
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:36,441
Yippee!

488
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:37,483
Oh, yeah!

489
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:39,068
This is amazing!

490
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:40,611
Like being in the circus!

491
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:42,905
Yeah, but without
those tortured animals

492
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,158
or drunken clowns that have hepatitis.

493
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:48,077
See, kids, I told you
we could have fun!

494
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:52,915
The best thing is,
no one will ever know.

495
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:57,378
Judas Priest. I can't
believe what I'm seeing!

496
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:02,008
Mr. Quinn, I was just telling
Conrad to get off the couch.

497
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,218
Bad, Conrad. Bad.

498
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:08,347
Sally, baby, angel, princess,

499
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:12,226
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, okay?

500
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,688
Nobody likes a suck-up!

501
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,408
Where's the cat?
I don't know.

502
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,293
Good bread.

503
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,590
What are you two looking at?

504
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,558
Is there a cat in here?

505
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,147
I'm gonna...
You're gonna... I have to

506
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:02,944
get out of here.

507
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:09,700
See, kids, I told you.

508
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,744
Stick with me, it'll all work out.

509
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:13,496
Oh, no!

510
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:19,210
Cats always land on their tushy.

511
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,962
I thought they always
landed on their feet.

512
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,089
Sure, now you tell me.

513
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,801
So, kiddo, what do
you want to do for fun?

514
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:27,969
I wanna make cupcakes.

515
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:31,889
Cupcakes? Oh, yeah!
To the kitchen!

516
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:33,182
Live from the kitchen,

517
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:34,517
the following is a paid commercial

518
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,810

hate all the hard cupcake work?

I know I do.

529
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,885
Well, forget everything you
know about making cupcakes,

530
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,971
and say hello

531
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:15,141

you have in the kitchen.

537
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,281
Wait a minute.
Did you say "anything"?

538
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,407
Anything.

539
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,450
Anything?

540
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:33,492
Yes, anything.

541
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:34,744
Anything?

542
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:35,953
Anything.

543
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,288
Anything?

544
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,291
I'll get you, and it'll look
like a bloody accident.

545
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,627
Anything.
Now, take off the lid.

546
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,837
You can put in, I don't
know, a carton of eggs.

547
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,631
What?
How about a pack of hot dogs?

548
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:47,965
That's incredible!

549
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,300
Why not some ketchup?

550
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,468
Yeah, why not?

551
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:51,636
How about...
I know what you're thinking.

552
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,180
Even a fire extinguisher.
There we go.

553
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,100
Now, close the lid
and Bob's your flipping uncle.

554
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:00,269
What an astounding product!

555
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:02,438
Oh, yeah!

556
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,565
Open the drawer,

557
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:08,402
fill the patented
Kupkake-inator tray,

558
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,405
close the drawer,

559
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:15,451
then place it in a conventional oven.

560
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:22,583
Delicious cupcakes
are just minutes away.

561
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:24,794
Did you just say "minutes away"?

562
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:26,003
- That's impossible!
- That's impossible!

563
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:27,755
You're not just wrong, you're stupid.

564
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,423
Now, wait just a minute.

565
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:31,759
And you're ugly, just like your mum.

566
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:34,053
Did you just call my mother ugly?

567
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,722
Shut up. I mean it. I will end you.

568
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,894
Cat. Your tail.

569
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:43,771
What about it?

570
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:47,358
I see.
I've chopped it off.

571
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,777
That's interesting, because...

572
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,154
Son of a bi...

573
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,452
Look, I'm not saying
we're going to sue.

574
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,996
I'm just saying we have a case.

575
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:03,541
We'll talk later.
Ixnay, ixnay.

576
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:05,876
Hi.

577
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:08,796
Cat, is the oven supposed
to be making that sound?

578
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,884
Of course. That means they're
almost done, Conrack.

579
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,053
Conrad.
That's what I said, Condor.

580
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:18,305
Cat!
Now, that's my name!

581
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,942
Yep. They're done!

582
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:31,694
Oh, man!

583
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:32,987
There's nothing to worry about.

584
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,655
I'm sure they still taste fine.

585
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,074
They're horrible.

586
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:40,161
Who wants some?
Come on, come on.

587
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,748
Oh, my cod.

588
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,710
Cat, you need to clean
this mess up, pronto.

589
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,044
We have a contract.

590
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:50,671
All right, I'll try.

591
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,217
You don't try. You do.

592
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:58,053
Yes, ma'am.
Right away, ma'am.

593
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,098
I'll be right back.

594
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:08,773
Hi. How are you?

595
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,149
Okay.

596
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,780
Look. I'm a girl.

597
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,994
Stop! That's...

598
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,829
Mom's dress!
Mom's dress!

599
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:26,999
This filthy thing?

600
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,126
She was gonna wear that
tonight, and you ruined it.

601
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:32,546
Honey, it was ruined
when she bought it.

602
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,466
Yeah.

603
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,052
I told you all this would happen.

604
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,013
But no one listens to a fish!

605
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,264
A dog goes "woof-woof"

606
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,141
and everybody knows that little
Timmy's trapped under a log.

607
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:45,810
But a fish speaks in plain English...

608
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:50,523
All right, everyone, let's just
take a deep breath and calm down.

609
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:56,570
You know who's gonna solve it?
Me. I am.

610
00:35:57,072 --> 00:36:00,074
I will personally
take care of everything.

611
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:03,244
And I know just the guys to do it.

612
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,551
In this box are two Things.

613
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,427
I will show them to you.

614
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:24,348
Two Things, and I call them
Thing One and Thing Two.

615
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,183
These Things will not bite you.

616
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:27,935
They want to have fun.

617
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:32,898
So without further ado,
meet Thing Two and Thing One!

618
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:37,111
Ta-da!

619
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,280
Oh, yeah!

620
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,118
Thing One, Conrad, Sally.
Conrad, Sally, Thing One.

621
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,370
Thing Two, Conrad, Sally.
Conrad, Sally, Thing Two.

622
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:49,373
Thing One, Thing Two. Thing Two, Thing One.
Conrad, Sally. Sally, Conrad.

623
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,541
I am the Cat.

624
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,251
Don't belittle me.

625
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,878
Yes, of course.

626
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,671
Thing Two would like to clarify that

627
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,047
just because he wears the number two

628
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:59,884
does not imply in any way that
he's inferior to Thing One.

629
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,093
And all of the above.

630
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:04,638
He says you may feel free to
call him Thing "A," if you like.

631
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:08,225
He will also accept Super Thing,
Thing King, Kid Dynamite,

632
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,476
Chocolate Thun-Da

633
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:10,895
or Ben.

634
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:16,483
Thing One says he's
Thing One for a reason,

635
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:19,194
and some people
should just get used to it.

636
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:21,655
It's a Thing thing.
You wouldn't understand.

637
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,824
Okay, enough.

638
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:27,286
You are quickly turning into one
of my least favorite Things.

639
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:31,665
Listen, Convex, you probably
don't wanna do that.

640
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,167
Why not?
It's just a crate.

641
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,044
This isn't just any old crate.

642
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:38,088
It's the Trans-dimensional
Transportolator.

643
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:41,342
It's kind of like a doorway which
leads from this world to my world.

644
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:43,719
But it says,
"Made in the Philippines."

645
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:45,763
Yes, but not this Philippines.

646
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:50,100
Look, now,
I'm not usually a rules guy,

647
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:51,602
but this is a biggie.

648
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,854
No opening the crate.

649
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:57,066
No lookee, no touchee.
Got it?

650
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:00,152
Mekka-dekka we should
settle our differences.

651
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:05,908
Things, front and center!

652
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:07,743
Cool.

653
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,995
All right, Things, I'm not paying you

654
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,039
to stand around and look pretty.

655
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,832
Here's Mom's dress.

656
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:15,834
Mommy's dress!

657
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,256
What about the couch?

658
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:22,549
Which couch?

659
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:25,135
The clean one, or the
horribly stained one?

660
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:34,895
Ho!

661
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:38,941
Mekka-dekka. Don't worry!

662
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:41,986
Incoming!

663
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:48,450
Cat, they're wrecking the whole house!

664
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,682
Conrad, help!

665
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:13,350
Help yourself!

666
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:14,768
Want a piece of me?

667
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,103
All right! Come and get it!

668
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:36,290
That tickles.

669
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,169
Geronimo!

670
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,967
Mine, mine, mine!
Mine, mine, mine!

671
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,470
Ride 'em, cowboy!

672
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:02,775
If this were my house, I'd be furious.

673
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:12,201
Hey! Klondike!

674
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:15,454
Do you have any idea what happened
to the lock on this crate?

675
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,747
It's on Nevins' collar.

676
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:17,998
Nevins?

677
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:20,417
Nevins? Nevins!

678
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:24,254
Put the dog down!
I said, put the dog down!

679
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:26,006
Why won't they listen to me?

680
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:28,092
I don't know if this helps,

681
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:31,595
but the Things always do
the opposite of what you say.

682
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,430
Why do they always do the opposite?

683
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:35,140
That's so annoying!

684
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:37,184
Remind you of anyone, Conrad?

685
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,894
Zinga!

686
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,188
Zinga! Zinga!

687
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,858
Blue! 41! Set!
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!

688
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,987
Hey, Thing, don't let go of that dog!

689
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:50,864
Let go!

690
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:54,243
Catch him.
I mean, don't catch him!

691
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,539
Well, this is just great, Conrad.

692
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,291
The whole house is destroyed,
the party is ruined,

693
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,335
and now Nevins is gone.

694
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:05,295
Sally, Kojak,

695
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,965
that's nothing compared
to what's gonna happen

696
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,842
if we don't lock this crate.

697
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:12,302
Take a look.
It's already leaking.

698
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:18,016
It won't stay shut.

699
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:20,269
Not without the lock.

700
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:22,855
Look, if we don't get
that lock off of Nevins

701
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:24,898
and put it back on this crate,

702
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,024
we're gonna be staring down

703
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:28,735
the business end
of the mother of all messes.

704
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:33,657
We've gotta go out and find Nevins.

705
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,784
Impossible! Sally!

706
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:37,995
There's only four
hours till the party.

707
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,831
The fish is right. We should call
Mom and tell her what happened.

708
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:44,168
Look at this house!
There's no way we could explain this to Mom.

709
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:47,004
We gotta get Nevins
back and lock the crate!

710
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:49,006
We're staying and calling Mom.

711
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,341
We're going and getting the dog.

712
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:53,594
There is a third option.

713
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:55,888
There is?

714
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:58,265
Yes. It involves...

715
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:00,767
murder.

716
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:03,228
That's your option?

717
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:04,396
No.

718
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,981
But you guys both had options.

719
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,774
I just wanted to have one, too.

720
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,068
Or did I?

721
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:12,738
Cat, you're not helping!

722
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:14,823
Come on.
Let's go get that dog.

723
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:19,453
Now, we just need a heavy, inanimate
object to weigh down this crate.

724
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,711
There. That ought
to buy us some time.

725
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,005
Come on, kids!
Let's go, go, go!

726
00:42:36,638 --> 00:42:39,431
Identical sister Mitzy...

727
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:40,724
That's right.

728
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:49,483
Yeah?

729
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,945
What do you want now?

730
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,446
Repo.

731
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:58,909
You're repossessing my TV?

732
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,327
I'm sure I made a payment.

733
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,703
If it's about that bounced check,

734
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:03,330
let me give you a credit card.

735
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:07,751
That one's expired.
Come on.

736
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:14,091
With the lock on his
collar, Nevins kept running,

737
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:18,220
unaware of his part
in the evil Quinn's cunning.

738
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:22,391
Joan Walden Real Estate.
Be it ever so humble, there's no...

739
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:23,642
Hi, Joan.

740
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,060
The kids let the dog out again.

741
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,770
You're kidding.

742
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,021
Don't worry.
I'll go get him,

743
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:31,149
then we'll have a conversation
vis-á-vis military school.

744
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:33,860
I don't know.
Conrad's like you, Lawrence.

745
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:36,196
He's very sensitive.

746
00:43:37,824 --> 00:43:40,117
But I suppose it's something
I should consider.

747
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:42,160
I'll get the dog.
I'll be right over.

748
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,299
Okay, there's Nevins.
Stay out of sight.

749
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,732
I thought the moment needed something.

750
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:14,609
What will become of us?

751
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:16,570
Your mother will lose her job,

752
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,740
and we'll have to live on the street.

753
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:23,452
I can't!
Don't make me go...

754
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:25,912
I don't know this world!

755
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:30,042
It's dry! It's like...
I can't... It's too...

756
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:31,251
Fish!

757
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:33,170
It's too much!

758
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:34,963
Would you like to go
back in the toilet?

759
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:36,548
On second thought,
it's such a beautiful day.

760
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:37,674
Why spend it indoors?

761
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,134
Thank you.

762
00:44:41,471 --> 00:44:43,055
Okay, kids.
Get out of my way.

763
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:46,099
This fence is no match for my
cat-like grace and reflexes.

764
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:47,309
Here we go.

765
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:54,024
Okay. Watch me fly, kids.

766
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,618
I don't think
the little girl's even trying.

767
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:08,622
What about your
cat-like reflexes?

768
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:11,750
What about showing a little
effort, shrimp boat? Now, push!

769
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:16,922
All right, Nevins.

770
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,965
Time to die.

771
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,093
Cat, you scared him away.

772
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,637
Dirty hoe.

773
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,308
I'm sorry, baby.
I love you.

774
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,311
Come on, Cat!

775
00:45:36,818 --> 00:45:38,026
There he is!

776
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,198
Happy birthday, Denise.

777
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:46,618
Denise?
Everyone I know is there.

778
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,330
There's Ginny and Alan.

779
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,458
How come Denise didn't
invite me to her birthday?

780
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:55,752
Don't worry.
Let's just get Nevins and go.

781
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:57,754
Okay, kids.
Everyone outside!

782
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:09,141
Cat, get down!
They're gonna see you!

783
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:10,350
Hide!

784
00:46:20,153 --> 00:46:23,071
Pinata! Pinata! Pinata!

785
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:27,284
Pinata! Pinata!

786
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:30,579
Everybody, join in.

787
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:36,960
It's breaking!

788
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,672
Step out of my way.

789
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:45,218
This cannot end well.

790
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,471
Pinata! Pinata!

791
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,724
I'm easy

792
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,646
I'm easy like Sunday morning

793
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,202
I got an idea. Candy!

794
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,123
Candy!

795
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:20,253
No!
No!

796
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,965
- Get back!
- Cat!

797
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,427
I'll get you!

798
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:34,100
I'd love to buy some.

799
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:35,977
Hello, Mrs. Kwan.
It's Joan Walden.

800
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:38,396
I just called to check on the kids.
Are they okay?

801
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,192
Those aren't children.

802
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:44,861
They're little angels.

803
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:49,366
That's sweet.

804
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:52,285
Well, all right, Mrs. Kwan.
I'll be home as soon as I can.

805
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:53,370
Bye-bye.

806
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:54,496
Bye.

807
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:27,028
All right, soldier.
Our bogey is in range.

808
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:29,489
Commence search and destroy.

809
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:30,782
What?

810
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,409
Search and rescue.

811
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:35,328
I meant search and rescue.
Come on.

812
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:39,833
I can't believe I wasn't
invited to that party.

813
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:42,419
Hey! You're a lone wolf.

814
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:45,171
Live alone, die alone.
Yeah.

815
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,466
Can we please get the dog?

816
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:51,511
Can we please get the dog?
Boo!

817
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,100
Oh, no! Oh, man!

818
00:48:57,518 --> 00:49:00,478
Hello, Nevins.
Good-bye, Conrad.

819
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:03,189
Not so tough now, are you?

820
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:16,828
We're dead. We're never
gonna get that crate shut.

821
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,163
And I'm getting shipped off to

822
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:20,206
Colonel Von Kronk's
School for Wayward Boys!

823
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,792
Why don't we take my car?

824
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:23,960
You have a car?

825
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:25,962
Yeah, sure.

826
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,470
That is so cool.

827
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:35,472
That's just the dust cover.

828
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:40,143
Here she is, the Super Luxurious

829
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,312
Omnidirectional Whatchamajigger.

830
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:45,065
Or S.L.O.W. for short.

831
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:47,108
S.L.O.W.?

832
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:50,320
Yeah, S.L.O.W.
It's better than the last name we had.

833
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:53,573
Super Hydraulic
Instantaneous Transporter.

834
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:55,158
You mean...

835
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:57,077
No! Quick, to the SLOW.

836
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:02,540
Buckle up, kids.

837
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:04,000
We're on a mission to get that dog,

838
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:06,961
and we will not rest
until we find and destroy it.

839
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:09,255
Rescue it! Rescue it!
Of course, I meant rescue it.

840
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:12,676
Whatever. Remember, kids, there's
nothing faster than SLOW.

841
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,929
That's backwards.
It makes no sense. Look at you.

842
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,723
Okay, here we go.
G. P.S., check.

843
00:50:18,808 --> 00:50:20,266
DVD, CD, check.

844
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:22,936
Someone from
Czechoslovakia is a Czech.

845
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:25,355
Siren.

846
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:26,606
What are you...
What... Siren?

847
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:31,152
Let's go!

848
00:50:34,907 --> 00:50:37,075
Hi, there!
How are you?

849
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:51,047
I'm sending Conrad away

850
00:50:57,513 --> 00:51:00,473
I can't believe
you whizzed on my taco!

851
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,729
Wait till Joan gets a load of you!

852
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:10,108
There they are!

853
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:11,818
Red light, red light, red light!

854
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,319
Red light!

855
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:19,826
Someone else should drive.

856
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:21,411
All right. You win.

857
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:22,787
Concrete, you drive.

858
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:24,122
Are you serious?

859
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,373
I don't know.

860
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:29,169
A little voice inside of me is
saying, "This is a bad idea,"

861
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:31,129
but I can barely
hear that little voice

862
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:33,381
because an even louder little voice

863
00:51:33,466 --> 00:51:35,550
is screaming,
"Let the 12-year-old drive!"

864
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:37,719
Now, punch it!

865
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,057
This is awesome!

866
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:50,732
I want to drive.

867
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,317
I think that's a great idea.

868
00:51:55,321 --> 00:51:58,239
Wait! Two people can't
drive at the same time.

869
00:51:58,324 --> 00:52:01,618
You're right.
We should all drive.

870
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:08,875
Cat! Where are the brakes?

871
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,293
I'll get them.

872
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,464
I think there's something
wrong with your brakes.

873
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,758
When's the last time
you had them checked?

874
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:20,053
Bad brake!

875
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:29,354
One-way street, one-way
street, one-way street,

876
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:30,522
one-way street!

877
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:37,987
Hey, Rhode Island license plate.

878
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,405
You never see those.

879
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:57,090
Air bag. Standard.

880
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:02,136
I think I wet my jar.

881
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,681
Can we do that again?

882
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,523
Hey, there he is!

883
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:19,362
Oh, no! He's going into Mom's office!

884
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:20,989
Come on, Cat!

885
00:53:21,407 --> 00:53:22,699
Go, Conrad!

886
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:25,535
You know, Nevins,

887
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,538
when Joan finds out you've escaped
again, Conrad will be moving out,

888
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,665
and I'll be moving in.

889
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:35,003
We've gotta get
Nevins and that lock back.

890
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:36,754
What are we gonna do?

891
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:39,048
Don't worry.
I have three plans.

892
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:40,675
Plan "A"...

893
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:44,721
Done that. Plan "B"...

894
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:48,558
That could work.

895
00:53:48,684 --> 00:53:49,809
What about that one?

896
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:51,561
Plan "C"...

897
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,234
I don't know.
I still like Plan "B."

898
00:53:58,402 --> 00:53:59,402
Cat!

899
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:02,322
Okay, okay. Plan "C."
Look at you.

900
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:08,119
Excuse me, sir.

901
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:11,372
I'd like you to
sign my petition. Yeah.

902
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:13,625
Get out of my way, you hippie freak.

903
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:16,419
Are you aware of the senseless,
wholesale slaughter

904
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:19,422
of the flatulating,
acid-spitting Zumzizeroo?

905
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:22,634
What will it take to
get you out of my face?

906
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:24,469
Just sign my petition

907
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:27,847
with this large, over-sized
pen that requires two hands.

908
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:29,015
I see.

909
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,518
Will you hold my dog?

910
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:33,811
Yes!

911
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:37,148
Okay, I have a problem
with the word "dog."

912
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:39,067
I don't use the "D" word per se

913
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:40,777
'cause I think
it's really, really wrong.

914
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:45,365
Yeah. But I will happily
hold your Canine-American.

915
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:48,326
I'm more comfortable
with that really, yeah.

916
00:54:49,078 --> 00:54:53,206
How much is that
Canine-American in the window

917
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:55,833
Cat! Come on!
Cat! Come on!

918
00:54:58,504 --> 00:55:00,421
Hey, what the...
Go, go, go!

919
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:03,257
Come back here!
I'm on to you kids!

920
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:06,177
Nothing to see here.
Keep moving! Go!

921
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,305
Come on! Let's go.
Ah, get in, get in!

922
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:11,474
Come on, let's go.
Get in! Hi, hi.

923
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,434
Get in! Get in!

924
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:16,729
Look out below!

925
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:19,607
Sorry. Over there.

926
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:25,405
Hey! Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

927
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:35,081
I got you!

928
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,835
Here he comes! Cat!

929
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:40,336
Cat!

930
00:55:43,382 --> 00:55:47,510
Where's my hat?
Go! Go, go!

931
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:49,512
Go! Let's go!
My tail, my tail.

932
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,139
Come on, Cat!

933
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:52,765
I'm walking here!

934
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:04,027
Joan. Joan!

935
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:07,363
I think we lost him.

936
00:56:07,448 --> 00:56:08,656
Not the pocket.
Not the pocket.

937
00:56:08,741 --> 00:56:10,408
We got the lock back.
Now let's get home.

938
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:12,410
Relax, kid.
I'm all over it.

939
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:16,539
Hey.
What's wrong?

940
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:17,623
This.

941
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:21,419
This is not my hat. I must have
picked up the wrong hat back there.

942
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,713
So?
So...

943
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:27,675
Without my hat, I'm just your
garden-variety, six-foot-tall, talking cat.

944
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,304
Joan, your children are running
around town like complete maniacs.

945
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:36,267
Yes, they are.
With some weird, hairy man in a big hat.

946
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:38,478
You're gonna believe
everything I'm telling you

947
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:40,938
once we get to your house,
okay? Come on.

948
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:42,565
We're doomed!

949
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:45,818
We're dead.
This is all my fault.

950
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:47,487
I'm such an idiot.

951
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:51,699
Why do I always have to do the
opposite of what I'm supposed to?

952
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:54,035
Wait a second.
That's it! The opposite!

953
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:56,746
Hey, Things!
Don't help us!

954
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,874
Do not show up and help
us get home right now!

955
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,919
We're goin' on a road trip!

956
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:04,712
Larry's car?

957
00:57:05,798 --> 00:57:08,174
How'd you get so smart?

958
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:12,637
So the race was on
to get back home first.

959
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:15,431
Hang on! We gotta
beat Mom and Quinn home!

960
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:19,519
But back at their home, things
were just getting worse.

961
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,954
There's Mom and Larry!

962
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:40,456
Step on it, Joan.
Go, go, go.

963
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:45,837
Things, do not do anything
to slow down my mom.

964
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:47,880
- Slow down Mom!
- Slow down Mom!

965
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:57,557
Look, Joan,
they don't beat them every day.

966
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,226
Great.

967
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:07,984
I'm sorry, Officer.
Was I speeding?

968
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:11,737
Mekka-dekka license,
appa registration.

969
00:58:13,282 --> 00:58:15,908
Mekka-dekka,
you're one hot mama.

970
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:18,494
Hey, that's my car. Joan,
we better go right away.

971
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:20,580
Please let me handle this.

972
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:22,999
Sorry, I guess I was
in a hurry to get home.

973
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:25,459
I'm not gonna let
them get away with this.

974
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:33,676
Meet me at the house!

975
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:48,191
Not so fast, you little maggots!

976
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,777
You are so busted.
Now get inside.

977
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:55,072
You don't want to go in there.
It's going to be a total...

978
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,075
What?

979
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,619
Sally, what happened?

980
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:01,078
What about the mother of all messes?

981
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:02,413
I don't know.

982
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,291
Why am I sneezing?

983
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:13,090
That'd be me. Boo!

984
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:15,384
You're a giant...

985
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,180
Cat!

986
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:24,977
Judas Priest!

987
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:27,730
Mamma mia.

988
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:34,403
What happened to our house?

989
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:36,781
It's the mother of all messes.

990
00:59:36,865 --> 00:59:37,990
Yup!

991
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:41,619
Pure, unadulterated fun without
any good sense or judgment.

992
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:44,038
See, Corn Dog,
this is why I warned you

993
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:46,040
not to open the crate.

994
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:48,751
Although, on the plus side,

995
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,503
I think people will be talking about

996
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,713
tonight's party for
the rest of their lives.

997
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:57,760
We gotta shut the crate!
Come on!

998
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,178
Okay.

999
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:03,349
Let's take the front hall carpet.

1000
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:05,893
This can't be the front hall.

1001
01:00:05,978 --> 01:00:08,771
This is what happens when you
mix your world and my world.

1002
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:11,190
And when you eat bad shellfish.

1003
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,901
Let's go. Oh, yeah!

1004
01:00:13,986 --> 01:00:15,528
Cat, how do we find the crate?

1005
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:16,654
Beats me.

1006
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:19,824
This hat is worthless,
and it makes me look fat.

1007
01:00:19,908 --> 01:00:21,659
Where's Mrs. Kwan?

1008
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:25,663
Here she comes, right on schedule.

1009
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:29,750
Oh, yeah!

1010
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:31,669
We're going to
ride Mrs. Kwan?

1011
01:00:32,254 --> 01:00:35,214
Sure! It's the only
way to the crate. Hop on.

1012
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:37,550
This is gonna be good.

1013
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:43,180
Please keep your hands and
feet in the Kwan at all times.

1014
01:00:43,682 --> 01:00:45,016
Enjoy the ride!

1015
01:00:47,728 --> 01:00:50,062
Ladies and gentlemen, the dining room.

1016
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,190
This is the dining room?

1017
01:00:53,525 --> 01:00:55,735
Hey, look. Chandelier.

1018
01:01:02,534 --> 01:01:04,201
Is that the bathroom?

1019
01:01:05,746 --> 01:01:08,414
You might want to hold it for a while.

1020
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,335
Something like that really burns my...

1021
01:01:16,298 --> 01:01:20,926
This is amazing!
It's like a ride at an amusement park!

1022
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:24,138
You mean, like at Universal Studios.

1023
01:01:25,724 --> 01:01:26,891
Cha-ching.

1024
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:39,111
Please exit the Kwan to your left.

1025
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:41,072
Have a nice day!

1026
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:44,950
This is ridiculous.
I have to get home.

1027
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:47,828
Police brutality.
Illegal choke hold.

1028
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:50,456
Where are we?

1029
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,540
The living room, I think.

1030
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:53,959
Ah, man.
My eyes are closed.

1031
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:56,921
If there's no line, could we
go back and do that again?

1032
01:01:57,005 --> 01:01:58,631
There's the crate!

1033
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:08,682
If we shut the crate, the
house will go back to normal.

1034
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:10,559
You have the lock?

1035
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:12,895
Got it. Come on, let's go.

1036
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:17,441
Sally!

1037
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,153
Come on!

1038
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:22,363
It won't shut!

1039
01:02:23,365 --> 01:02:27,201
Sally! Everything is
disappearing up there!

1040
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:28,285
Help!

1041
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:29,370
Sally!

1042
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:32,331
Sal...

1043
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:33,749
Help me, Conrad!

1044
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:35,167
Sally!

1045
01:02:36,837 --> 01:02:40,381
Help me! I can't hold on!

1046
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:42,758
Hang on!

1047
01:02:42,843 --> 01:02:44,260
Help me, Conrad!

1048
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:45,553
Help!

1049
01:02:45,637 --> 01:02:47,930
Sally, I can't reach the lock!

1050
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:49,098
No!

1051
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:51,934
I can't save you unless you let go!

1052
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,270
Okay.

1053
01:02:56,273 --> 01:02:58,149
Help me!

1054
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:01,777
Yes.

1055
01:03:36,605 --> 01:03:38,481
I did it. I did it.

1056
01:03:38,565 --> 01:03:41,317
I did it. I did it. I did it.

1057
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:43,527
I did it. I did it.

1058
01:03:46,698 --> 01:03:49,617
Okay, "we" did it.

1059
01:03:51,495 --> 01:03:53,454
I don't think we did anything.

1060
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,164
The place is still a wreck.

1061
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:57,833
You said if we shut the crate,
everything would be okay!

1062
01:03:57,918 --> 01:04:00,961
But it's not.
It's a complete disaster.

1063
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:03,088
Well, what are you gonna do?

1064
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:05,508
Tennis, anyone?

1065
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:17,770
Love that new ball smell.
Yeah.

1066
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:21,398
Hey, your hat, it's magic again?

1067
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:25,861
Well, now that
the cat's out of the bag,

1068
01:04:25,946 --> 01:04:28,697
to use an archaic
and cruel-sounding metaphor,

1069
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:30,115
why don't you serve first?

1070
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,284
You had your real hat this whole time?

1071
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:35,621
Yup. I planned
the whole day.

1072
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:37,706
What do you mean,
you planned the whole day?

1073
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:39,375
All of it?
Yup.

1074
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:40,751
The house getting trashed?
Yup.

1075
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:42,545
Quinn taking Nevins?
Yup.

1076
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:44,922
Cutting off your tail?
Nope. No.

1077
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,968
You even knew I'd open the crate?

1078
01:04:49,803 --> 01:04:51,470
Why do you think
I made it my one rule?

1079
01:04:51,555 --> 01:04:53,097
I knew you couldn't resist.

1080
01:04:53,181 --> 01:04:56,267
Now, who's up for a game
of Canadian doubles?

1081
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:01,730
Cat, you said
nothing bad would happen.

1082
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:04,733
Cat, you need to get out.

1083
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:06,235
I don't know that game.

1084
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:09,029
It's not a game.
None of this is a game!

1085
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:13,909
But I thought you two
wanted to have fun today.

1086
01:05:13,994 --> 01:05:15,077
Look around, Cat.

1087
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:18,247
You were right. It's fun to have
fun, but you have to know how.

1088
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:20,332
You don't know when enough is enough.

1089
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:21,959
Now, go!

1090
01:05:22,794 --> 01:05:24,003
Suzy.

1091
01:05:25,005 --> 01:05:26,547
Cromwell.

1092
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:28,591
Please.

1093
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:30,842
Out!
Out!

1094
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:57,161
Good riddance.

1095
01:05:57,245 --> 01:06:00,414
Now, this may not be the time
for "I told you so," but...

1096
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:08,881
Like I said, not the time.

1097
01:06:09,341 --> 01:06:11,300
I'll get the mop and bucket.

1098
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:13,302
Conrad, you might
want to get out of here

1099
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:15,471
until Mom has a chance to calm down.

1100
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:20,142
No. This was my fault.
I'll take the blame.

1101
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:21,977
Look, Mom will be home any second.

1102
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:23,646
Why don't you go upstairs?

1103
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:26,273
I'm not going upstairs.
I'm staying with you.

1104
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:27,941
Really? Why?

1105
01:06:28,068 --> 01:06:29,693
Two reasons.

1106
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:32,154
One, the stairs are destroyed.

1107
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:37,034
Two, this is just as
much my fault as yours.

1108
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:39,620
We should share the blame.

1109
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:43,207
Thanks, Sally.

1110
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:46,293
By the way,
you're a pretty good brother.

1111
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,212
Glad you think that.

1112
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:50,673
Maybe we can room together
at military school.

1113
01:06:54,219 --> 01:06:56,637
Well, here goes.

1114
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:09,108
Bet you thought I'd gone
Bet you felt a sting

1115
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:12,027
Bet you never thought
I'd have another song to sing

1116
01:07:12,112 --> 01:07:15,072
But now that you've learned your
lesson Allow me to blow your mind

1117
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:16,573
By reading to you the small print

1118
01:07:16,658 --> 01:07:18,033
of the contract that you signed

1119
01:07:18,118 --> 01:07:21,870
Okay, section eight,
article 93, subparagraph 834.

1120
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:23,455
Right by the chili stain.

1121
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:27,543
It reads, "If Conrad, a.k.a.
Concrete, should open the crate,"

1122
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:30,838
and we know he will, "the
contract shall be null and void.

1123
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:33,882
"However,

1124
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:36,176
"if Sally and Conrad should
learn from their mistakes,

1125
01:07:36,261 --> 01:07:38,178
"the contract
shall be reinstated."

1126
01:07:38,263 --> 01:07:41,306
And I think you two have satisfied
the legal burden of learning.

1127
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:42,474
Yeah!
Yeah!

1128
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,268
So there's just one last game to play.

1129
01:07:44,352 --> 01:07:45,686
It's called
"Clean Up the House."

1130
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:50,149
Kids, meet the Dynamic Industrial
Renovating Tractormajigger.

1131
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:51,984
D-I-R-T?
D-I-R-T?

1132
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,652
That's right!

1133
01:07:57,490 --> 01:08:00,868
It's getting better all the time

1134
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:04,496
I used to get mad at my school

1135
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:07,958
The teachers who
taught me weren't cool

1136
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:10,002
You're holding me down

1137
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,920
Turning me 'round

1138
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:15,424
Filling me up with your rules

1139
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:19,052
I've got to admit it's
getting better Better

1140
01:08:19,137 --> 01:08:21,764
A little better all the time

1141
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:23,599
It can't get no worse

1142
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:27,269
I have to admit it's
getting better Better

1143
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:30,314
A little better since you've been mine

1144
01:08:33,902 --> 01:08:37,362
Me used to be an angry young man

1145
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:40,115
Me hiding my head in the sand

1146
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:44,787
You gave me the word I finally heard

1147
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:48,332
I'm doing the best that I can, yeah

1148
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:50,959
I've got to admit it's getting better

1149
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:54,463
Better A little better all the time

1150
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:55,881
Can't get no worse

1151
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,091
I have to admit it's getting better

1152
01:08:58,176 --> 01:09:00,844
Better It's getting better

1153
01:09:00,929 --> 01:09:02,012
Since you've been mine

1154
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:03,138
Oh, yeah!

1155
01:09:03,223 --> 01:09:04,473
Getting so much better

1156
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:06,350
These drapes are so out, they're in!

1157
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:07,851
All the time

1158
01:09:07,936 --> 01:09:09,895
It's getting better all the time

1159
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:12,481
Better, better, better

1160
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:13,565
Spin! Spin!

1161
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:17,110
It's getting better all the time

1162
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:20,531
Better, better, better

1163
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:43,178
I have to admit it's getting better

1164
01:09:43,263 --> 01:09:46,723
A little better all the time

1165
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:50,686
It can't get no worse Yes, I
admit it's getting better

1166
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:51,979
It's getting better

1167
01:09:52,063 --> 01:09:53,063
Bye.

1168
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:55,148
Since you've been mine

1169
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:59,152
Getting so much better all the time

1170
01:10:02,824 --> 01:10:05,826
Okay, we had some good times.

1171
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,619
We cleaned up the house.

1172
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:10,372
We even managed to work in an
up-tempo pop tune for the soundtrack.

1173
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:12,416
That's important.

1174
01:10:13,334 --> 01:10:16,336
I guess there's just
one last thing to check.

1175
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:31,643
Looks like everything's in balance,

1176
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:33,437
but you're still smoking
way too many cigars.

1177
01:10:33,521 --> 01:10:36,648
And you, lay off the sauce.

1178
01:10:39,277 --> 01:10:43,822
Cat, this day has been amazing.

1179
01:10:45,325 --> 01:10:47,284
Thank you, Cat.

1180
01:10:50,163 --> 01:10:51,997
For everything.

1181
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:56,168
Conrad?

1182
01:10:57,712 --> 01:10:59,671
Sally?

1183
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:03,133
Adieu.

1184
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:08,347
- Cat!
- Cat!

1185
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:09,514
Wait, Cat.

1186
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:10,641
Don't go.

1187
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:19,191
All right, kids.

1188
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,275
This place better not be a mess.

1189
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,736
I'm home.

1190
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:24,863
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Mom.

1191
01:11:25,365 --> 01:11:27,324
Miss Walden, home so soon?

1192
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:29,409
The children were angels.

1193
01:11:29,661 --> 01:11:31,036
Thanks, Mrs. Kwan.

1194
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,120
Hello, Joan.

1195
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:35,916
Lawrence, what happened to you?

1196
01:11:37,669 --> 01:11:40,295
They happened to me.

1197
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:43,757
Your demonic children.

1198
01:11:45,093 --> 01:11:47,344
They destroyed your house!

1199
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:51,682
The house was alive.

1200
01:11:51,808 --> 01:11:53,433
The wall was made of paper.

1201
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:57,396
I fell off the cliff.
And the giant cat...

1202
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:00,816
The giant cat!

1203
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:03,568
Tell her.

1204
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:06,113
Larry, Larry.

1205
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:08,365
You look terrible,

1206
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:11,034
and my mom thinks you're insane.

1207
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:14,997
This is what we in sales
call "a win-win scenario."

1208
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:20,293
Joan, you are passing up the
opportunity of a lifetime.

1209
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:24,047
You know what kind of kid your boy is.

1210
01:12:24,132 --> 01:12:27,175
I mean, who are you going to believe?

1211
01:12:28,636 --> 01:12:32,055
You're right. I do know
what kind of kid Conrad is.

1212
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:34,141
He can be irresponsible.
Yes.

1213
01:12:34,225 --> 01:12:35,225
He makes bad choices.

1214
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:36,309
Yes.

1215
01:12:36,394 --> 01:12:37,978
Sometimes he makes me
want to tear my hair out.

1216
01:12:38,062 --> 01:12:39,604
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1217
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:43,650
But he's a good kid,
and I believe in him.

1218
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:45,861
Now, I'd like you to leave.

1219
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:48,655
Wha... Joan. Joan.

1220
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:52,200
Joan. Joan.

1221
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:57,164
Oh, Joan, Joan, Joan.

1222
01:13:06,007 --> 01:13:08,216
Will you marry me, Joan?

1223
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:11,720
Oh, Joan, Joan, Joan, Joan.

1224
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:17,809
Yes!
Yeah!

1225
01:13:18,853 --> 01:13:20,479
Yeah!

1226
01:13:21,064 --> 01:13:23,732
That's nice.

1227
01:13:29,572 --> 01:13:30,864
Mr. Humberfloob?

1228
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:35,452
Almost got me again.
Enjoy the party.

1229
01:13:36,204 --> 01:13:37,204
Mr. Humberfloob.

1230
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:40,457
Joan, the party's a hit
and the house is immaculate.

1231
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:42,334
Congratulations.

1232
01:13:42,794 --> 01:13:44,586
Miss Walden. Miss Walden.

1233
01:13:44,712 --> 01:13:47,422
Chicka-ow,
chicka-ow, chica-yee-haw!

1234
01:13:47,507 --> 01:13:48,757
Hi, Mom.

1235
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:50,509
Honey, your cupcakes are a huge hit.

1236
01:13:50,593 --> 01:13:51,927
What did you put in them?

1237
01:13:52,011 --> 01:13:54,721
Mom, you can make
cupcakes out of anything.

1238
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:58,517
Are you telling me you can
make cupcakes out of anything?

1239
01:13:58,601 --> 01:13:59,810
Anything.

1240
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:01,144
Anything?

1241
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:04,648
So what did you kids do today, huh?

1242
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:08,193
Well, what would you
do if your mother asked you?

1243
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:11,696
The family was whole,
all thanks to the Cat,

1244
01:14:11,781 --> 01:14:14,825
who was dashing and charming,
no doubt about that.

1245
01:14:14,909 --> 01:14:16,701
He was witty and cultured

1246
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:20,956
and, well, very endearing
and tremendously attractive,

1247
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,375
but in a sort of real way.

1248
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:25,252
You know, kind of an approachable way

1249
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:27,504
that I think
you don't see these days...

1250
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:29,631
Hello! I was just...

1251
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:32,384
I really should be going.

1252
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,554
How'd they get so smart?

1253
01:14:41,102 --> 01:14:42,561
Oh, yeah!

1254
01:14:57,743 --> 01:14:59,494
Come on, Things!
Let's go!

1255
01:14:59,579 --> 01:15:02,247
What's on my schedule for tomorrow?

1256
01:15:03,249 --> 01:15:06,251
What do you say we go on vacation?

1257
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:08,753
How about Hawaii?
I like Hawaii.

1258
01:15:10,131 --> 01:15:12,174
I should warn you,
there are certain places

1259
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:14,259
that don't allow certain Things.

1260
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:18,221
Things are complicated.

1261
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:43,079
Things are getting weird
Things are getting tough

1262
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:46,625
Nothing's making sense
but you keep on looking up

1263
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:50,086
They tell you to be true
You're trying every day

1264
01:15:50,171 --> 01:15:53,465
To keep it on the real
Still you gotta find a way

1265
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:57,052
To make your mama happy
To make your papa proud

1266
01:15:57,136 --> 01:16:00,513
You wanna turn it up but all
you hear is "tone it down"

1267
01:16:00,598 --> 01:16:04,017
So gather 'round, I'm here to say

1268
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:07,479
You'll never make everybody's day

1269
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:10,106
But while you're around
you might as well

1270
01:16:10,191 --> 01:16:13,151
Catch the tiger by its tail

1271
01:16:13,444 --> 01:16:15,779
And hang on, hang on, hang on

1272
01:16:15,863 --> 01:16:19,199
Everybody just get on, get on, get on

1273
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:22,661
Get started and go on, go on, go on

1274
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:28,166
Everybody just hold on

1275
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:31,795
Sometimes I wanna cry
or throw the towel in

1276
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:35,215
They try to bring me down
but I'll take it on the chin

1277
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:38,760
And everywhere I go
the people are the same

1278
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:42,180
They just want to know
that everything will be okay

1279
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:45,767
When things are getting rough
you turn it back around

1280
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:49,187
You gotta turn it up when
they tell you "tone it down"

1281
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:52,607
So gather 'round, I'm here to say

1282
01:16:52,692 --> 01:16:56,111
You'll never make everybody's day

1283
01:16:56,195 --> 01:16:58,738
But while you're around
you might as well

1284
01:16:58,823 --> 01:17:01,866
Catch the tiger by its tail

1285
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:04,411
And hang on, hang on, hang on

1286
01:17:04,495 --> 01:17:07,747
Everybody just get on, get on, get on

1287
01:17:07,915 --> 01:17:11,293
Get started and go on, go on, go on

1288
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:15,588
Everybody just hold on

1289
01:17:15,673 --> 01:17:20,635
Just hang on

1290
01:17:34,734 --> 01:17:37,902
So gather 'round, I'm here to say

1291
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:41,364
You'll never make everybody's day

1292
01:17:41,449 --> 01:17:44,159
But while you're around
you might as well

1293
01:17:44,243 --> 01:17:47,162
Catch the tiger by its tail

1294
01:17:47,246 --> 01:17:49,622
And hang on, hang on, hang on

1295
01:17:49,707 --> 01:17:53,126
Everybody just get on, get on, get on

1296
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:56,546
Get started and go on, go on, go on

1297
01:17:56,630 --> 01:18:01,593
Everybody just hold on

1298
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:03,553
Hang on, hang on, hang on

1299
01:18:03,637 --> 01:18:06,890
Everybody just get on, get on, get on

1300
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:10,393
Get started and go on, go on, go on

1301
01:18:10,478 --> 01:18:14,647
Everybody just hold on

1302
01:18:14,732 --> 01:18:20,195
Just hang on
