1
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,815
<i>For centuries the sacred magic
of the Divine Crystal...</i>

2
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,234
<i>...blessed our world and its people.</i>

3
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:35,244
<i>But in time the promise of its power
brought war to our lands.</i>

4
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:46,681
<i>Lucis, a peaceful kingdom of great magic
kept safe by the power of the crystal.</i>

5
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,219
<i>And Niflheim,
a military empire of vast machinery...</i>

6
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:55,014
<i>...made strong by
the might of its Magitek.</i>

7
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:58,313
<i>Long has war raged between the two.</i>

8
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:05,107
<i>As the years passed,
Niflheim marched on nearby nations...</i>

9
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,363
<i>...driven by its unsurpassed technology.</i>

10
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:14,033
<i>To defend itself,
Lucis raised a magical wall...</i>

11
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:17,287
<i>...the strength of which comes
from the crystal itself.</i>

12
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:23,087
<i>Insomnia alone, the crown city
and last bastion of Lucian defence...</i>

13
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:26,171
<i>...remained beyond Niflheim reach
for many years.</i>

14
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:31,683
<i>Amid the escalating war...</i>

15
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,311
<i>...Prince Noctis of Lucis
had come to Tenebrae...</i>

16
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,813
<i>...to seek healing for a grievous injury.</i>

17
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:41,398
<i>He made the long journey
together with his father, King Regis.</i>

18
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,318
<i>Mother, brother, and I,
the royalty of Tenebrae...</i>

19
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,482
<i>...had all welcomed their visit.</i>

20
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:06,047
<i>It was then that the fires came,
everywhere and all at once.</i>

21
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:12,557
<i>In a mere instant,
the whole of Tenebrae was ablaze.</i>

22
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,053
<i>Ravus!</i>

23
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,446
Mother!

24
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,704
General Glauca.

25
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:48,468
<i>The Niflheim attack was an attempt on the
lives of the visiting Lucian royalty.</i>

26
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,968
Noctis!

27
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,607
Please. Help us!

28
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,234
King Regis!

29
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,958
Lunafreya...

30
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,048
Luna!

31
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,168
<i>From that day until this day...</i>

32
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,760
<i>...Tenebrae has been gripped
in the iron fist of Niflheim...</i>

33
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,971
<i>...sworn enemy of Lucis.</i>

34
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:46,064
<i>King Regis assembles a force of mighty
warriors to combat the imperial menace.</i>

35
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:50,652
<i>Dubbed the Kingsglaive,
they fight relentlessly against Niflheim...</i>

36
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,908
<i>...empowered by the magic
of their sovereign.</i>

37
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,920
All units, move to secure the Wall.

38
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,709
If they break through, we're done.

39
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,285
What's the hold-up, Crowe?

40
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,784
<i>Crowe! Status?</i>

41
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,160
Almost there.

42
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,247
No!

43
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,514
<i>I need help. East Wall's going down.
Pelna, can you get to me?</i>

44
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,177
Lucis isn't paying us refugees enough...

45
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,311
...for this.

46
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,403
How is this fair?

47
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,912
Nyx, I owe you one.

48
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,167
You and everyone else.

49
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,833
<i>We need support on the east flank.
Nyx, where are you?</i>

50
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,091
I'm on my way.

51
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,549
Pelna, fall back
and regroup with the others.

52
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,930
Go easy on the magic, hero.

53
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,932
You got people
waiting for you back home.

54
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,388
I'm worth the wait.

55
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:45,887
Show-off.

56
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,573
<i>Watch your back, Libertus.
We got more incoming.</i>

57
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,743
We ain't gonna last much longer.

58
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,163
Crowe!

59
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,288
Yes!

60
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,760
<i>All Glaives, fall back.
Repeat, all Glaives fall back!</i>

61
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,603
Release the daemon.

62
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:35,061
<i>We can't take down that daemon.
I'm ordering a full retreat.</i>

63
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,526
<i>Get back here alive.
That's an order.</i>

64
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,361
<i>For hearth and home.</i>

65
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:59,753
<i>All units, fall back to the extraction point.
Support is inbound.</i>

66
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,504
Nyx! We have to get out of here.

67
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:10,266
- Nyx! We have orders!
- Yeah.

68
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,426
Help!

69
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:12,594
Nyx!

70
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,183
That idiot.

71
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,777
Nyx!

72
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,897
Crowe. We gotta move.

73
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,066
You gotta be kidding me.

74
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,690
You know I ain't got
the stomach for this crap.

75
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:05,985
Would you rather walk?

76
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,149
Come on.
Just like Galahd Canyon back home.

77
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:22,710
Libertus!

78
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,650
Luche, report.

79
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:51,618
The imperial forces
look to be withdrawing, sir.

80
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,842
Guess I owe you another one.

81
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,216
I'll put it on your tab.

82
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,597
You just try and get some rest, all right?

83
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,028
You disobeyed a direct order to retreat.

84
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,113
For hearth and home, right, sir?

85
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:42,995
As long as I got strength in my body,
I obey that order.

86
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,964
Don't fool yourself, Nyx Ulric.

87
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,421
Whatever strength you have
is on loan from the king.

88
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,424
You are nothing without him.

89
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,215
Await details of your reassignment.

90
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,455
Yes, Your Majesty.

91
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,037
Despite their victory all but assured.

92
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,045
A sudden and inexplicable retreat.

93
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,802
We are at risk nonetheless, Your Majesty.

94
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,764
We cannot know
when they will strike again.

95
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,592
Your Majesty, word from the West Gate.

96
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,644
A man claiming to be an envoy
of the empire requests an audience.

97
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:31,565
The envoy from Niflheim awaits without,
Your Majesty.

98
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:37,908
Hello there.

99
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,198
Hello!

100
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,613
Good day to you...

101
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,197
...and you.

102
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,375
Well met, my dear Lucians.

103
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:49,329
Has Niflheim grown so bold...

104
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,791
...that they send the chancellor himself
as envoy?

105
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,294
And under no guard, at that?

106
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,510
It is an honour to be recognised
by the great King Regis.

107
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:04,436
Yet permit me to stand on ceremony
and introduce myself nonetheless.

108
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:09,479
Ardyn Izunia, Chancellor of Niflheim...

109
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:13,520
...at your humble service.

110
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,772
And I come to you on this...

111
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:20,451
...most auspicious of days
to offer terms of peace.

112
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:22,411
Peace?

113
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,035
As you no doubt surmised...

114
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,669
...that recent manoeuvre of ours
was no strategic retreat.

115
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,046
Call it...

116
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,009
...a gesture of imperial goodwill.

117
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,970
Like you, we wish nothing more...

118
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:43,884
...than to bring a swift end
to this senseless war.

119
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:45,977
Is that so?

120
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,178
It is, indeed.

121
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,565
And we require
but a singular compliance.

122
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:55,066
Save your grand Insomnia here.

123
00:14:55,269 --> 00:15:00,776
Lucis must forfeit
all territories to Niflheim rule.

124
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,538
Insomnia!

125
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:09,451
The jewel in the crown
of the Lucian kingdom.

126
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,412
How foolish of me to forget.

127
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,794
There is just one more trivial thing.

128
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,342
It concerns your son.

129
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,472
The fetching Prince Noctis of Lucis...

130
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:27,348
...and the fair Princess Lunafreya
of Tenebrae...

131
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,722
They are to be wed.

132
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,400
You seem vexed, Your Highness.

133
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:40,904
I assure you, the princess
still holds you in the highest regard...

134
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,444
...as she has done
all these 12 long years.

135
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,688
Don't know if anyone's told you...

136
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,465
...but we don't take kindly
to insubordination around here.

137
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,105
Do yourself a favour, take a look around.

138
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:17,189
This is what a hundred years of peace
looks like.

139
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:25,653
It's a lasting peace made by the Wall
and the Wall alone.

140
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,787
See, we don't need any of you
immigrants...

141
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:36,413
...jumping around, playing war hero.

142
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,494
Hey!
Rough day on the gate, huh, Glaive?

143
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,538
You jerk.
It's your fault he got stuck there.

144
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:21,632
- Not a very nice welcome for a big hero.
- Not a very nice outfit for one, either.

145
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,418
I think it brings out my eyes.

146
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,180
What'd you put in this?

147
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,682
Tastes like a chocobo turd.

148
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,057
Hey, Shut your trap!

149
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,345
This ain't Galahd.
That's the way folks around here like it.

150
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:39,359
Oh, well. I'm glad to see you're willing to
sell out our heritage for a few extra gil.

151
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,653
Hey, Libertus.
You thank Nyx for saving your life yet?

152
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:45,986
Oh, come on, Crowe.
Nyx and I are too close for that.

153
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,776
He helps me, I help him.
That's the way it's always been.

154
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,492
Looks like you got a little help
from something else, huh?

155
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,201
I need all I can get.

156
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,408
For hearth!

157
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:57,789
- And home.
- And home.

158
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:04,384
So, Nyx the Gatekeeper.
How's the new post treating you?

159
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,586
Oh, it's amazing.
You guys would love it.

160
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,759
The gate watch are real sweethearts.

161
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:10,673
Yeah, right.

162
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,434
We all know they hate us outsiders
more than anything.

163
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,766
So bored they got nothing better to do.

164
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,480
Boredom's not so bad.

165
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,015
Means there's peace, at least.

166
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:22,109
I'd fight a hundred more wars
for Galahdans to know boredom.

167
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:23,985
Fight all you want.

168
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,488
Just don't go dying yet.

169
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,280
I still owe you.

170
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:28,858
A lot.

171
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,660
Where would the Glaive be
without its hero?

172
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,572
Can you not talk like this
while we're drinking, please?

173
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,913
We just sent the Niffs running
with tails between their legs, right?

174
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,828
They weren't running from us.
No, they were toying with us.

175
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:46,251
Stop being such a buzzkill, Luche.
We all know what happened.

176
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,174
Did you know they sent an envoy
to the Citadel after that?

177
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,840
What for? To offer their surrender?

178
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,349
- More like demand ours.
- What?

179
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,509
Demand? My ass!

180
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,519
No? Think about it.

181
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,851
The empire's got Lucis on its last legs.

182
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,142
It's the perfect time to make demands.

183
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,863
We are losing this war, Your Majesty.

184
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,445
Lucis cannot rely
on the Kingsglaive alone.

185
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,737
Accepting the truce may be
our best course of action.

186
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,451
You speak of matters
beyond the New Wall.

187
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:20,456
We have no need of a truce here,
so long as it stands.

188
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:25,089
And if our position worsens,
we still have the Old Wall.

189
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:30,295
Yes, but this truce
will end the fighting altogether.

190
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,514
If only we could compromise...

191
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,596
Compromise is unwise.

192
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:38,602
We know nothing
of Niflheim's true intentions.

193
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:42,978
Do not fool yourselves.
The Walls are far from impenetrable.

194
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:46,440
The paths left to us are few.

195
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,818
The New Wall draws its power
from the throne.

196
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:54,865
I am able to sustain it for some years yet,
if the kingdom requires it.

197
00:19:56,153 --> 00:20:01,125
But the chancellor spoke one truth,
if only one.

198
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,254
We are old, and the Old Wall...

199
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:10,502
I cannot command the Old Wall
with a weakened hand...

200
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:15,094
...nor do I have the strength to muster
an offensive to turn the tide on this war.

201
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:18,017
Then let the choice be made,
Your Majesty.

202
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,062
What are we to protect?

203
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,498
<i>Help Mother!</i>

204
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,187
How come you never
lose your lunch like that?

205
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,065
Just doesn't add up.

206
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,526
Here's this ancient art,
secret of the royal family and all that.

207
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,066
Libertus! Nyx!

208
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,615
Come here, guys, you gotta see this.

209
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,500
<i>Things were hectic in the capital today...</i>

210
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,425
<i>...as the Lucian government
announced full acceptance...</i>

211
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:26,293
<i>...of what some are criticising
as the unilateral peace terms...</i>

212
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,500
<i>...proposed by Chancellor Izunia
of Niflheim.</i>

213
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,958
<i>The signing of the truce will see
power over all Lucian territories...</i>

214
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,378
<i>...transferred to the empire,
with the sole exception of Insomnia.</i>

215
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:39,924
<i>In return, Niflheim guarantees
the safety of Insomnia and its citizenry...</i>

216
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,305
<i>...as well as a cessation
to all hostilities...</i>

217
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:45,392
<i>...bringing a decisive end
to this long and bitter war.</i>

218
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:53,021
All that fighting we did.
All for nothing.

219
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:57,150
Glaives.
Assemble in the briefing room.

220
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,572
Now.

221
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:09,082
The king has spoken,
and you have heard.

222
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,794
All lands beyond the Wall
are to be relinquished to the empire.

223
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,875
Will no regions be spared?

224
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,879
- None.
- But your home's out there too!

225
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,255
It is.

226
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,090
Why would the king do this?

227
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,058
Because it'll end this damn war.

228
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,599
- Crowe.
- Sir!

229
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:30,938
Prepare to deploy.
You're being sent to infiltrate Tenebrae.

230
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,609
Tenebrae, sir?

231
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,275
Mission details are classified.

232
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:38,032
Report to my office for briefing
in 30 minutes.

233
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:40,610
And, Nyx...

234
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,574
You're off the West Gate.

235
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,497
You've been reassigned
to the castle guard.

236
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,742
That is all.

237
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:58,048
So this is what you were
talking about, Luche?

238
00:22:58,252 --> 00:22:59,299
You heard the captain.

239
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,635
- This wasn't our decision to make.
- Not ours to make?

240
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,389
Those are our homes out there!
Our people!

241
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:08,012
You're just gonna go along
and abandon them?

242
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,725
If we don't go along with them...

243
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,142
...the empire will unleash all hell
on Insomnia.

244
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,686
- We'll unleash it right back at them!
- Easy, easy.

245
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,069
He's not the enemy.

246
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,772
Don't you get it?

247
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,192
We're nothing to them.

248
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,950
Rats, snuck in from beyond the Wall.

249
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,831
Sure, they had a use for us...

250
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,163
...when they realised
we could work their magic.

251
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:33,079
So they handpicked us
from all the other rats out there...

252
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:38,046
...and just let us nibble away
at his royal majesty's precious power.

253
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,795
But as soon as this war's all over...

254
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,381
...it's back to the sewers for all of us.

255
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:47,472
That means you too, hero.

256
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:53,433
You missing home so much, Libertus,
why don't you and Nyx head on back?

257
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,022
I'm sure Niflheim will welcome you
with open arms.

258
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,233
You've got a home out there too.

259
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,862
Or did you forget?

260
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,121
Damn it!

261
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,875
I'm not gonna let it end like this.

262
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:24,263
It is said sentiment amongst the people
is favourable, Your Majesty.

263
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,674
Most all will welcome this peace.

264
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,568
If you yourself
have not heard their voices...

265
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,970
...how can you claim
to know their hearts?

266
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:34,060
What of the mission to Tenebrae,
Your Majesty?

267
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,521
Is such clandestine action wise?

268
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:39,608
If discovered, it will only serve
to provoke the empire.

269
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,944
The empire remains our enemy
until the treaty is signed.

270
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,692
So long as we are at war...

271
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,907
...His Majesty intends to remain
one step ahead of them.

272
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:49,488
Of course.

273
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:03,510
A hairpin? I didn't think you were
into that kind of thing.

274
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:06,464
It's not for me.
It's a gift for the princess.

275
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:08,967
But keep that quiet.
Nobody's supposed to know.

276
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,312
Well, that's me.

277
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,723
Watch your back out there.

278
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:19,185
I know you're sick of hearing it,
but you're like a little...

279
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,821
Little sister to you.
Yeah, I am sick of hearing it.

280
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:28,160
Just make sure you come back
in one piece, all right?

281
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,411
Says the guy in two pieces.

282
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,899
Lady Lunafreya,
I have left the rear gate open.

283
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,059
Thank you.

284
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,192
Must you go?

285
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,355
Yes.

286
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,534
Then go quickly.

287
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,290
I do not recall granting you permission to
leave your quarters, Lunafreya.

288
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:20,288
Ravus.

289
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:27,762
You are not to leave this room again
until the journey to Lucis.

290
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,593
It is for your own good.

291
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:31,928
My own good?

292
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,308
What is truly going on here?

293
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:40,608
What cause does the empire have
to see me wed to Noctis?

294
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:44,153
They have offered a peace,
and your marriage is the olive branch.

295
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:46,230
You expect me to believe that?

296
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,448
What you believe does not concern me.

297
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,069
What does concern me
is you sneaking off...

298
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:54,330
...to go tell our mother's killer
about some plot you've dreamt up.

299
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,957
You are wrong to hate King Regis.

300
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:00,418
Niflheim killed Mother, not him.

301
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:04,336
They murdered her
and made you their lapdog.

302
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,610
It's done.

303
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:08,400
<i>An air of jubilation has swept the city
in anticipation of the coming armistice.</i>

304
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:13,075
<i>With only three days remaining until the
peace is officially signed into effect...</i>

305
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:16,370
<i>...throngs of citizens
have taken to the streets to show...</i>

306
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,922
<i>Lucis needs your strength,
young warriors.</i>

307
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,480
<i>We don't need
any of you immigrants.</i>

308
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,712
<i>Whatever strength you have
is on loan from the king.</i>

309
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,220
<i>- You are nothing without him.
- Nyx, help Mother.</i>

310
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,517
<i>Selena, get down.</i>

311
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,770
<i>...and the waves of
imperial diplomats entering the city.</i>

312
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:47,102
The princess? Are you certain?

313
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,985
Yes, Your Majesty.

314
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:53,441
She was amongst the last of
the imperial contingent to enter the city.

315
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,723
Get in.

316
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,185
I'm reporting to my post now though, sir.

317
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,054
New orders.

318
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:27,270
Come on.
We've got a princess to pick up.

319
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:36,029
Nice ride, sir.

320
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,410
It belongs to the prince.

321
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,570
We've taken him outside the city.

322
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:43,991
Doesn't he have a wedding to plan, sir?

323
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,873
Cut the "sir" crap.

324
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,087
The king has a plan of his own.

325
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:52,716
Prince Noctis and Princess Lunafreya
are to meet far from Insomnia.

326
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,413
What's she doing here then?

327
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,842
Complicating things.

328
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:01,182
We sent Crowe to find the princess
and escort her out of Tenebrae.

329
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:07,398
We're still trying to figure out
what went wrong.

330
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:25,166
So I know what you think about this war,
but what do you think about this peace?

331
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,745
You happy giving up your home?

332
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,752
It's the king's decision.
I owe him for taking me in.

333
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:36,131
I was lucky.
There are people in Galahd who weren't.

334
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,383
And they need me.

335
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,761
So you're going back?

336
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:44,556
What good will you be
without the king's magic?

337
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,724
Yeah, always wanting to save somebody.

338
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:53,485
I get it. Believe me.
But it doesn't win wars.

339
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,021
It's not just wanting.

340
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:58,407
It's not just me.

341
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:01,781
Libertus is the one
you need to worry about.

342
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,537
He'll go back if things gets worse.

343
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,659
The worst is yet to come.

344
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,815
Do you have any idea
who you're stopping?

345
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:35,477
Open this gate now,
and maybe you'll have a job tomorrow.

346
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,613
- King's orders.
- Are you sure you want to risk...

347
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:41,525
...a diplomatic issue now, of all times?

348
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:45,946
I am the personal escort
of Lady Lunafreya Nox Fleuret...

349
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:48,582
...princess of the former Tenebrae and...

350
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,619
And our kingdom's beloved bride-to-be.

351
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:55,710
Welcome to sovereign jurisdiction.
We'll take care of things from here.

352
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,392
- Forgive me, Captain Drautos.
- See Her Highness to the castle.

353
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,595
I had no idea that you...
I wasn't made aware of any...

354
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,880
- Excuse me. Thank you.
- No, you... I must...

355
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,192
I must... No, I have to clear it
with my superiors first.

356
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:07,763
Your Highness.

357
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:22,275
Her Royal Highness,
Princess Lunafreya of Tenebrae.

358
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:32,747
It has been a long time, Your Majesty.

359
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,458
Yes.

360
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,127
Far too long.

361
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,587
Prince Noctis isn't here, is he?

362
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:46,010
No, my dear. He is not.

363
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,224
I am too old to fight this war.

364
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:57,063
I have no choice but to receive
the empire and accept their treaty.

365
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,023
Even so...

366
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:04,199
...I had hoped to hold the wedding
elsewhere, somewhere safe.

367
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:07,281
I sent one of my Glaive
to see you there, but...

368
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,956
It is not too late.

369
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:14,209
I can ready an escort.

370
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,745
Please, go to my son.

371
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:20,465
No.

372
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:25,053
Wherever I go, the empire will follow.

373
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:29,558
It would only place the prince
in greater danger.

374
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:35,226
It is my duty to protect the prince
and see his destiny fulfilled.

375
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:39,063
These 12 years
have not changed that.

376
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:42,187
And what of your destiny?

377
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:47,193
My duty is my destiny, Your Majesty.

378
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:51,622
I'm prepared to accept
whatever may come to pass.

379
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,461
So, what do you think?

380
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,928
All these lands will be imperial soon.

381
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:09,306
Reckon things will get better
when them Niffs start calling the shots?

382
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,137
Not one damn bit.

383
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,393
Don't matter who's calling the shots.

384
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:15,592
Long as they're calling them
from behind the Wall...

385
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:18,265
...ain't nothing gonna change
around here.

386
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,479
Get over here.

387
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:22,189
All right.

388
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:27,608
<i>That's a hand!</i>

389
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,739
I trust the reunion was a happy one?

390
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,455
Has she been a hostage of Niflheim
all this time?

391
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,753
She is a symbol of the peace.
That's all I'm told.

392
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:40,912
Doesn't sound like it.

393
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,182
Sounds like she's here
for something much bigger than that.

394
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,334
Your orders are to protect her.

395
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,678
Not to look, not to listen, not to think.

396
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,510
Understood?

397
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,762
Drautos.

398
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,892
Yes, report.

399
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:03,652
Get the hell out of my way. That's
my friend you got in there, damn it.

400
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,913
Sir, you can't go in
until the examination has ended.

401
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,939
What examination?
What the hell's going on?

402
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,734
Hey, take it easy, big guy.

403
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:14,905
These bastards rushed Crowe in there
the moment she got back.

404
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,994
And now they won't let me in
to see her.

405
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,703
Wait.

406
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,826
Crowe's personal effects.

407
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,170
Do with them as you see fit.

408
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:09,793
So, what kind of mission
did you really send her on?

409
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:14,723
No Glaive winds up dead
on a standard escort.

410
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:19,720
I'll see the armistice does not interfere
with a full investigation.

411
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,478
She was a good soldier.

412
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,394
Her death will not go unanswered.

413
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,904
What a life, huh?

414
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,992
She was brought up an orphan.

415
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:41,704
Run out of her village.

416
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:48,833
I still remember the first time I saw her.

417
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,084
Scrawny little thing...

418
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,379
...all covered in dirt.

419
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,098
Not a friend in the world.

420
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:02,350
But those eyes...

421
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,181
Damn.

422
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:07,393
There was something
about those eyes.

423
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,444
She deserved better.

424
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,914
And I would've done anything
to give it to...

425
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:38,632
Libertus, wait.

426
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,019
Crowe died a Glaive.

427
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,813
You can still honour her
by fighting as one.

428
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:50,569
You're dumber than me sometimes,
you know that?

429
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:52,650
Don't you get it?

430
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,406
Lucis killed Crowe.

431
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,702
Go back to the castle.

432
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:09,167
Tell the king there's no peace to be had
from throwing the weak to the wolves.

433
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,958
I'll fight my own fight from here on out.

434
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:18,301
See you around, hero.

435
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:48,539
<i>A hairpin?</i>

436
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,581
<i>I didn't think you were
into that kind of thing.</i>

437
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:53,040
<i>It's not for me.
It's a gift for the princess.</i>

438
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:35,461
A most grand reception, King Regis.

439
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,126
You honour all of Niflheim.

440
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:42,218
Oh, the honour is ours,
Emperor Aldercapt.

441
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:45,767
You have ventured far
to grace us with your presence.

442
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:49,016
It was the very least I could do.

443
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:54,901
Tomorrow will be an historic day
for both our nations.

444
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:59,356
And your Insomnia is truly a marvel.

445
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,698
My own cities pale in comparison.

446
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:08,866
I pray we are able to take away much
from this visit.

447
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,419
Hello.

448
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:22,254
I am afraid we were never
properly introduced yesterday.

449
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:27,509
I'm afraid it's going to have to wait,
Your Highness. I'm on guard duty.

450
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,390
Then surely there's
no safer place for me to be.

451
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,648
May I ask your name?

452
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:39,316
Nyx. Nyx Ulric.

453
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,201
There is something else
I wish to ask you, Nyx Ulric.

454
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,867
King Regis said he sent
one of your order to come find me.

455
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:52,496
I should like to offer my thanks
in person.

456
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,495
Where might I find this brave soldier?

457
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,879
Oh, I did not...

458
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:07,307
- I am so sorry.
- Don't be.

459
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,765
Here.

460
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,232
She was carrying this.

461
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,309
It was meant for you.

462
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:21,855
For me?

463
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:23,986
Keep it.

464
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,780
She would've wanted you to have it.

465
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,365
I will carry it with me always.

466
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,204
Thank you.

467
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:06,783
Do you have any idea
what this peace means?

468
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,410
It means our homes are gone...

469
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:10,946
...all of them...

470
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:12,830
...forever.

471
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,462
Heard I could find
some treaty haters here.

472
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,127
I come to the right place?

473
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,008
You certainly have.

474
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:26,465
Everyone say hello to a man
who spends his days...

475
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,721
...in the loyal service of our good king.

476
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,723
"Spent."

477
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:33,301
Those days are over.

478
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:36,521
I'm done listening
to that bastard's lies.

479
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,353
He may sit on a throne,
but he ain't no king...

480
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,609
...least not of mine.

481
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,733
Well, then...

482
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:47,027
...welcome to the resistance, brother.

483
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:49,697
I hope you're here to talk.

484
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:51,615
What do you wanna know?

485
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,914
Please...

486
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:05,584
...wherever Noctis is, keep him safe.

487
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,718
That is all I ask.

488
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:10,050
To what god do you pray?

489
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:13,929
You, the slave of fate and destiny.

490
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:17,721
Abandon your prayers.

491
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,647
The gods do not listen.

492
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:22,776
General Glauca. Why are you here?

493
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:26,900
You are far too clever
to have ever believed in this peace.

494
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:31,152
Pity you couldn't see your beloved
Noctis. You have another purpose.

495
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:34,036
- I'm not here for Niflheim.
- No.

496
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:35,538
You are here for me.

497
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:36,864
You?

498
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,453
I do not understand.

499
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,290
Come tomorrow, you will.

500
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:31,544
<i>Niflheim contingent has left the hotel.</i>

501
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:33,884
<i>Less than three hours
until the ceremony.</i>

502
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,723
<i>Bolster the Citadel guard.</i>

503
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:44,724
<i>Nyx, is the princess with you?</i>

504
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:45,933
No.

505
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,522
I'm on duty at the Citadel.

506
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:50,105
<i>Well, the Niffs just left
for the ceremony.</i>

507
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:52,319
<i>And she wasn't with them.</i>

508
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,764
<i>- A homing beacon?</i>
- Yeah, I'll send the coordinates now.

509
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:18,391
Can you pinpoint a location for me?

510
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,802
<i>Sure, but it sounds like
a wild-goose chase.</i>

511
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,848
<i>Guess you got some
free time on your hands, huh?</i>

512
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:25,811
Guess I do, for better or worse.

513
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:51,708
<i>Those coordinates are about
20 miles south of Insomnia.</i>

514
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,630
Outside the Wall.

515
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:56,553
<i>What the hell was Crowe doing
all the way out there?</i>

516
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,760
No, no. They sent her to...

517
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:03,311
I need another favour, Pelna.

518
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,530
Pull those coordinates up on the radar
and let me know what you find.

519
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:08,307
<i>On it. You're thinking
this is all a big deal now, huh?</i>

520
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:09,642
Yeah, too big to ignore.

521
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,898
- Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.
- Hey, hey, hey.

522
00:46:15,064 --> 00:46:16,987
- Whoa, wait a minute.
- Stop right there.

523
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,658
Listen up. This is not the gate watch.

524
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:28,795
This is the heart of our city,
the home of our king.

525
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:31,627
The ceremony must not be disturbed.

526
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:35,134
Neutralise any threat quickly and quietly.

527
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:36,965
Is that understood?

528
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:38,926
Yes, sir.

529
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,556
Glaive to command.
Are you there, captain?

530
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,187
Urgent.

531
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,973
Damn it, Drautos.

532
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:35,103
<i>Jackpot, Nyx. There's a whole fleet of
airships sitting at that spot.</i>

533
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,271
- Niflheim.
<i>- Yup, and from the looks of it...</i>

534
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:38,985
<i>...I'd say they're headed to war.</i>

535
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,667
- Where's the captain?
<i>- Should be at the Citadel.</i>

536
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,091
There's no answer on his frequency.

537
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:44,546
<i>I don't know, must have his hands full
with the escort detail.</i>

538
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:48,120
Pelna, one last favour.
I need you to prep the Glaive for action.

539
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,454
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

540
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:51,377
<i>You wanna deploy
without the captain's order?</i>

541
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,832
Trust me. Just get it done.

542
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,713
<i>Wait, what am I supposed to tell...?</i>

543
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:55,961
Stand down, Glaive.

544
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,840
The ceremony is in less than two hours.

545
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,883
We must make ready.

546
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,100
Very well.

547
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:11,560
Your Majesty.

548
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:13,607
A man of the Kingsglaive is here, sire.

549
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:15,143
He demands an audience.

550
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:16,815
"Demands"?

551
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,511
- Your Majesty, please.
- Halt.

552
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,606
Give the order to deploy the Glaive.

553
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,864
You.

554
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:27,822
A Niflheim fleet makes ready for war
20 miles to the south.

555
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,740
An imperial fleet.

556
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,333
And they have the princess.

557
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:36,339
Clarus, post guards
outside the treaty room.

558
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:38,377
It will be seen
as a lack of faith in the peace.

559
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:40,168
Which we all harbour.

560
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,378
See it done.

561
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,131
We may well have to take
Emperor Aldercapt into custody.

562
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:47,011
Detain him?

563
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,472
That would go beyond
a new declaration of war.

564
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:52,058
We are still at war, Clarus.

565
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:56,479
And you, Nyx Ulric.

566
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,982
How soon can the Kingsglaive deploy?

567
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:02,615
On your word, at once.

568
00:49:03,149 --> 00:49:04,776
Go, then.

569
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:06,486
Save Luna.

570
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,458
What if this is a diversion?

571
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:14,911
Not likely.

572
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:17,296
Tenebrae's princess is on board.

573
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:24,337
We've got two jobs.

574
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:26,718
Save her.

575
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:30,343
And stop those Niff ships
from flying on Insomnia.

576
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:39,106
We go in teams.

577
00:49:39,852 --> 00:49:42,776
Standard infiltrate and extract.

578
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,650
Nyx, you command. We'll follow.

579
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:52,289
The Glaive stands together,
captain or no.

580
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:53,537
For hearth.

581
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,201
And home!

582
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:12,552
<i>We are less than 20 minutes away
from the signing of this historic treaty.</i>

583
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:23,195
<i>I received word
of the king's order to deploy.</i>

584
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:24,856
<i>I'll see to matters in the city.</i>

585
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:28,944
<i>You have your mission,
and it won't be easy.</i>

586
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,531
<i>The objective is two-fold.</i>

587
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,947
<i>Secure the hostage,
and stay the enemy advance.</i>

588
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:35,245
<i>Just be careful.</i>

589
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:37,751
<i>One Glaive already died
for this princess.</i>

590
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:40,501
<i>Niflheim won't give her up easily.</i>

591
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:54,934
<i>Team Two.</i>

592
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,448
<i>Oh, man.</i>

593
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:17,283
<i>Hurry up, Nyx!</i>

594
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:25,917
<i>Help!</i>

595
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,602
Over here.

596
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:44,856
Preparing to head below deck.

597
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:47,693
<i>Do not engage the enemy
until instructed.</i>

598
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,277
<i>The ceremony is underway.</i>

599
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,193
<i>Let's wait and see
how Niflheim plays this.</i>

600
00:51:57,323 --> 00:51:59,371
The Kingsglaive
have infiltrated the ships.

601
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,911
So everything's going according to plan.

602
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:35,237
Ulric reporting. Six Niflheim airships
confirmed inbound for Insomnia.

603
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:43,957
Nyx, this doesn't feel like a war fleet.

604
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:10,946
I think I might've found her.
I got a guarded door here.

605
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:14,109
<i>Two Niff MTs. What's the plan?</i>

606
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,612
Hold position.

607
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:22,621
Arrived at destination.
High possibility of target in the vicinity.

608
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:27,504
<i>Proceed to secure.</i>

609
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,089
It's going to mean a fight.

610
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,883
<i>Keep it quiet and keep it confined.</i>

611
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:35,137
Pelna, you're clear to engage.
But keep it quiet.

612
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,135
I'm on my way.

613
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:44,271
Forgive my delay.

614
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:46,728
A bit of unforeseen trouble.

615
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,734
Nothing too vexing, I hope.

616
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:52,696
A simple theft, nothing more.

617
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:55,153
A daring thief, to steal from the king.

618
00:53:55,983 --> 00:54:01,661
Perhaps magical walls and castle gates
do not keep all things safe.

619
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:03,369
Perhaps.

620
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:07,670
But no matter. That which was taken
will soon be returned.

621
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:09,671
Impressive.

622
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:14,043
You are a paragon of kingly composure.

623
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:17,717
But I must ask...

624
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,591
...how can you be so sure?

625
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:24,057
Because this thing is no mere trinket.

626
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:27,063
It possesses a will all its own.

627
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:30,435
Enough to break any thief's grasp.

628
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:37,484
That sounds a very fine prize indeed.

629
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,744
Not now, damn it.

630
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,464
For me? You shouldn't have.

631
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,720
Target confirmed. She's unharmed.

632
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:07,354
The Glaives have recovered the princess,
Your Majesty.

633
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:13,314
<i>Have you found your thief?</i>

634
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:14,896
We have.

635
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:17,656
And what was stolen remains intact.

636
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:19,237
Joyous news.

637
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,868
I am relieved to hear it.

638
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:24,371
Tell me...

639
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:25,993
...how heavy a sentence...

640
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:29,160
...does the crime of theft
carry in your empire?

641
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:30,711
Among the heaviest.

642
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:33,213
Although there is one...

643
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:35,089
...exception.

644
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:38,427
Things are about to get ugly over here.

645
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:42,632
Pelna, get out of there. It's a trap.

646
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:45,846
- What is that?
- A curious old law...

647
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,637
...I still permit in the outlands.

648
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:51,683
A thief who escapes his captor...

649
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:54,443
...can no longer be held to account
for his crime.

650
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,021
A warning to the victim.

651
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:02,531
Never show weakness,
lest you forgo the hand of justice.

652
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,987
Oh, no, good king.

653
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:08,073
Far from it.

654
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:10,330
<i>The treaty is now on the table.</i>

655
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:13,086
<i>The countdown begins
to this historical moment.</i>

656
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:17,375
<i>It is a warning
to the hand of justice itself...</i>

657
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:21,258
...never to loose its grip.

658
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,809
Unit One, secure the perimeter.

659
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:37,819
Unit Two, stand your ground.

660
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:41,198
Pelna.

661
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:44,701
One Tenebrae princess, safe and...

662
00:56:47,446 --> 00:56:48,447
Come on.

663
00:57:13,472 --> 00:57:16,191
The crystal. They're after the crystal.

664
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:23,699
There's something going on below deck.

665
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:26,652
The ship's not going to make it
to Insom...

666
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,785
You...

667
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:38,456
<i>What's going on?</i>

668
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:39,839
<i>Insomnia is under attack.</i>

669
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,584
Who brought you here?

670
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:45,129
- General Glauca.
- You were bait.

671
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,514
Us coming here was all part of their plan.

672
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:18,083
Target secured.
Request permission to withdraw.

673
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:21,836
<i>Granted. Get to...</i>

674
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:49,652
The crystal will not serve you.

675
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,828
Nor you...

676
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:55,074
...once I take it from this accursed city.

677
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:58,540
It's not the crystal I'm here for.

678
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:01,046
The Wall. It's gone.

679
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:05,418
Fall back. It's a trap.

680
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:15,640
What the hell is going on?

681
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:28,023
Traitors.

682
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:30,822
What's got into you?

683
01:02:17,025 --> 01:02:19,448
Come, we must escape while we can.

684
01:02:19,611 --> 01:02:21,284
No, Clarus.

685
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,916
I fear escape is no longer an option.

686
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,922
General Glauca.

687
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:42,012
Can you make it up? Can you stand?

688
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:04,956
Luche!

689
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,878
What are you doing?

690
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:24,009
You gotta be kidding me.

691
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:32,275
They teach piloting
back at the royal academy?

692
01:03:32,434 --> 01:03:34,186
Give me that.

693
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:41,693
Been a long time
since I fought at your side, old friend.

694
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:43,237
Yes...

695
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:46,239
...but this time it is not your fight.

696
01:03:46,406 --> 01:03:48,124
If you wish to leave, go now.

697
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:51,537
And abandon my king? I think not.

698
01:03:51,703 --> 01:03:55,173
Besides, our magic is bound to you.

699
01:03:55,707 --> 01:03:58,051
If you fall, Lucis falls.

700
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:01,175
Then let us once more into the fray...

701
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:02,931
...old friend.

702
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:31,830
You must take me back to King Regis.

703
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:34,712
Are you out of your mind?
Insomnia's a war zone.

704
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:37,708
I have a duty. I cannot neglect it.

705
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:41,174
- Yeah, I heard all that before.
- Then you know we must hurry.

706
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:43,213
Hurry to do what? Get yourself killed?

707
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:44,381
I do not fear death.

708
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:47,426
Enough with all this brave princess act.

709
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:53,932
Just pray this thing will make the trip.

710
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,003
Clarus.

711
01:05:23,795 --> 01:05:28,050
Well, I daresay everything has proceeded
according to plan.

712
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:30,556
- No?
- So it has.

713
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:32,391
We have broken the Wall.

714
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:35,103
All that remains is to break the city.

715
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:39,356
Shall we take our leave, then?

716
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:41,567
The sun will soon set.

717
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:46,242
We need not be here
to witness the terrors of the night.

718
01:05:58,371 --> 01:05:59,497
The crystal.

719
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:06,088
You're going too fast.
We have to land.

720
01:06:06,254 --> 01:06:10,225
- You're gonna have to give me a minute.
- There is no time. I will go on my own.

721
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:13,478
You got wings underneath that dress?
You can't use magic.

722
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:16,681
Not all miracles are made by magic.

723
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:18,566
I do not fear death.

724
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:21,649
What I fear is doing nothing
and losing everything.

725
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:25,030
Oh, come on.

726
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:35,663
You can thank magic for that miracle,
Your Highness.

727
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:57,476
The reckoning is at hand.

728
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:03,603
Dawn of a new age.

729
01:07:07,815 --> 01:07:11,069
You have the crystal.
What more would you take from me?

730
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,798
The Ring of the Lucii.

731
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:31,298
<i>I lost my mother, my country,
my birth-right.</i>

732
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:33,887
Niflheim was the only life left to me.

733
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:36,719
But all of that was for this.

734
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:40,440
The ring belongs to me now.

735
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:54,780
Hear me, Lucian kings of old,
for I am Ravus Nox Fleuret...

736
01:07:54,988 --> 01:07:58,333
...and none is more worthy of your power
than I.

737
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:02,462
No. Why?

738
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,622
Why do you refuse me?

739
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,149
Look out.

740
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:54,384
Quickly, through here.

741
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:16,695
This leads to a hidden passageway.

742
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:17,908
Follow it.

743
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:19,789
Once you are away, make for Altissia.

744
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:21,199
Noctis awaits you there.

745
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:24,294
- Your Majesty.
- You knew this was coming...

746
01:09:24,452 --> 01:09:27,456
Yes. But it was the only way
to draw their wrath from Noctis.

747
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:31,342
Is that the way of our king?

748
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:34,721
Sacrifice Lucian sons to save his own?

749
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:36,552
To save the world.

750
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:40,810
See Luna safely to Altissia.

751
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:45,473
This is not an order
from a king to his Glaive.

752
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:49,144
This is a plea from one man to another.
Please, Nyx Ulric, keep her safe.

753
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:51,984
For the future of all.

754
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:53,944
The future?

755
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:58,570
Here.

756
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:00,158
Take this.

757
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:03,871
It is time it passed to another's keeping.

758
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:38,405
No, please. Stop.

759
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:40,491
- Get back.
- Please. Don't leave us.

760
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:45,496
I know your mother
would wish the same as me.

761
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:49,500
That you and Noctis live happily.

762
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:52,666
All those years captive
because I failed you.

763
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:53,879
Not again.

764
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:56,920
Locked doors
will seal your fate no longer.

765
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:59,009
King Regis...

766
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:03,893
Our hope goes with you now,
Nyx Ulric. Godspeed.

767
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:41,840
Behold the King of Lucis...

768
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,593
...who hoarded tranquility
within his precious walls.

769
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:49,601
Where is your tranquility now, king?

770
01:11:50,515 --> 01:11:54,691
Here is your peace,
by steel's swift descent.

771
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:12,249
Go.

772
01:12:32,223 --> 01:12:35,648
No. We must get away from here.

773
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,612
It is what your king wanted.

774
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:21,238
<i>Lady Lunafreya has escaped
with the ring.</i>

775
01:13:21,856 --> 01:13:22,948
<i>Find her at once.</i>

776
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:24,575
<i>She is not to leave the city.</i>

777
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:29,702
<i>- Ulric to command. Come in, captain.
- Footage of the perpetrators...</i>

778
01:13:29,864 --> 01:13:31,866
<i>...was captured
by a nearby surveillance camera.</i>

779
01:13:32,033 --> 01:13:34,001
<i>Here are images of the six suspects.</i>

780
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:38,040
<i>One has been identified
as Galahdian refugee, Libertus Ostium...</i>

781
01:13:38,205 --> 01:13:41,584
<i>...a former member
of the Lucian Kingsglaive.</i>

782
01:13:43,628 --> 01:13:45,505
Hey, come here. Come here.

783
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:47,673
I got you, I got you. You're all right.

784
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,513
You're okay.

785
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:51,681
It's fine.

786
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:53,096
We're free.

787
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:55,064
We're free now.

788
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:57,190
We're free? What do you mean,
"We're free"?

789
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:59,944
The empire. They promised.

790
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:02,735
This district's ours.

791
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:04,649
All the refugees.

792
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:06,658
It's our new home.

793
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:10,405
- The empire? You went in with Niflheim?
- Here.

794
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:13,708
Take this. Meet up with the others.

795
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:18,792
You're the hero of our revolution,
brother.

796
01:14:23,918 --> 01:14:24,965
Damn it.

797
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:36,268
This guy just doesn't know
when he's beat.

798
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:39,733
- Can you drive?
- I can try.

799
01:14:43,354 --> 01:14:44,697
I'll be right back.

800
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:58,252
No warping for you this time, hero.

801
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:05,088
Give me the wheel. Go.

802
01:15:07,795 --> 01:15:09,172
You are without your magic.

803
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:13,013
You noticed that, huh?
It must have died with the king.

804
01:15:13,384 --> 01:15:15,603
You're making a mess of my city, Glaive.

805
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:17,481
I thought I told you
not to go playing hero.

806
01:15:18,139 --> 01:15:19,311
Leave the ship to me.

807
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:22,193
Looks like you got a royal fare to see to.

808
01:16:11,776 --> 01:16:13,073
Move it.

809
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:41,146
Maybe not all miracles
are made by magic.

810
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:51,774
Oh, great.

811
01:17:09,917 --> 01:17:11,965
The hell did you do
to piss these things off?

812
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:14,881
It's not me they're after.
It's the ring.

813
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:18,517
What's so special about this ring?
Don't tell me the future's riding on it.

814
01:17:18,676 --> 01:17:20,556
He who wears the ring
communes with the Lucii...

815
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:22,980
- ...and commands great power.
- What kind of power?

816
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:26,018
A forbidden one.
Sealed within the ring, long ago.

817
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:31,105
The Old Wall.
I thought that was just a bedtime story.

818
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:40,205
I can assure you it is not.

819
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:43,493
But the Lucii grant their power
only to those they deem worthy.

820
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:45,787
So that guy who tried it on back there...

821
01:17:45,953 --> 01:17:47,796
...I guess he wasn't deemed worthy.

822
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:50,625
That was my brother.

823
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:55,633
These 12 years have changed Ravus.

824
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:58,717
He is bound by the past,
and lost in his lust for power.

825
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:02,265
How the hell did they find us?

826
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:24,583
Your hairpin. They're tracking it.
Give it to me.

827
01:18:32,249 --> 01:18:36,379
I had a little sister once.
She was killed when the empire came.

828
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:40,012
I couldn't save her.

829
01:18:40,883 --> 01:18:43,887
I was as helpless then as I am now.

830
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:49,104
I couldn't show her the future
she wanted.

831
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:55,273
True power is not something that is found
by those who seek it.

832
01:18:56,357 --> 01:18:58,906
It is something that comes
to those who deserve it.

833
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:03,948
Your sister wanted you to see
a future as well.

834
01:19:07,034 --> 01:19:09,958
Anyone would wish the same
for family they love.

835
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:16,794
You don't pull any punches, do you?

836
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:26,054
I'm over here.

837
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:28,564
<i>Do you hear me?
Repeat, this is Drautos.</i>

838
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:30,065
<i>Can you hear me? Over.</i>

839
01:19:30,349 --> 01:19:32,397
Your timing's impeccable, captain.

840
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:39,483
If the Lucii are real...

841
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:42,494
...they sure don't seem to mind
their city getting torn apart.

842
01:19:48,492 --> 01:19:50,620
<i>You're to rendezvous and regroup.
Understood?</i>

843
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:54,548
Might not be so easy, captain.

844
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:58,131
My wings have been clipped,
if you didn't know.

845
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:32,165
<i>Ulric. Are you all right?</i>

846
01:20:33,787 --> 01:20:35,789
I'm not dead, if that's what you mean, sir.

847
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:38,755
<i>Head for Section D
as soon as you can.</i>

848
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:41,215
<i>I'll have an evacuation team ready.</i>

849
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:44,215
Don't suppose you could meet me
at the gate.

850
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:46,725
I'd kind of like to
get the hell out of this city.

851
01:20:46,884 --> 01:20:49,558
<i>Imperials hold all exits.
There's no way through.</i>

852
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:50,972
<i>I'll meet you at Section D.</i>

853
01:20:51,138 --> 01:20:55,188
<i>Cut all radio contact until then.
And make sure you get there.</i>

854
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:56,398
It's a date, sir.

855
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:15,538
Ain't no turning back now.

856
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:17,001
<i>Status report.</i>

857
01:21:17,164 --> 01:21:19,166
<i>Ulric killed some good men.</i>

858
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:21,552
<i>- What about the ring?
- We don't have it yet.</i>

859
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:25,131
<i>This is Glauca. King Regis is dead.</i>

860
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:27,884
<i>The ring is on its way to Section D.</i>

861
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:30,599
<i>We must recover the ring
to realise our goal.</i>

862
01:21:30,761 --> 01:21:33,605
<i>If Ulric or the princess get in the way,
take them out.</i>

863
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:36,062
<i>Reclaim our hearth and home.</i>

864
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:38,148
"Hearth and home"?

865
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,436
<i>Libertus, come in.</i>

866
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:41,276
<i>Where are you? Are you all right?</i>

867
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:42,781
I'm fine.

868
01:21:43,649 --> 01:21:45,526
On the way back to base now.

869
01:21:45,692 --> 01:21:48,161
<i>We need you to head to the junction
in Section D.</i>

870
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,540
<i>We're gonna join with another unit,
make a clean sweep of the place.</i>

871
01:21:51,698 --> 01:21:54,326
<i>We're one step away
from realising this revolution.</i>

872
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:56,712
<i>Let's not let Pruvia's death be in vain.</i>

873
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:59,123
<i>We'll be waiting for you, hero.</i>

874
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:28,948
- Don't move until I say it's safe, all right?
- I won't.

875
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:39,121
Ulric, reporting.

876
01:22:40,372 --> 01:22:42,466
I have the princess.

877
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:44,718
She's alive and well.

878
01:22:52,593 --> 01:22:53,936
- No!
- Get out of here.

879
01:22:57,139 --> 01:22:59,642
You've got some fight in you, Nyx,
I'll give you that.

880
01:23:01,602 --> 01:23:03,229
Run. Now.

881
01:23:05,022 --> 01:23:09,243
I can't believe you're still moving
with that hollowpoint in you.

882
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:13,076
All Crowe could do was scream,
when one tore her insides apart.

883
01:23:14,448 --> 01:23:18,203
- Why'd you do it?
- Because the Kingsglaive is nothing.

884
01:23:18,368 --> 01:23:19,961
An old man's battle fodder...

885
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,872
...sent to die in insomnia's war...

886
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:23,791
...while our homes
are bound and shackled.

887
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:26,668
Niflheim took your home.

888
01:23:28,962 --> 01:23:30,805
Took all our homes!

889
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,763
Nothing will ever change that.

890
01:23:34,051 --> 01:23:35,974
You never were too smart.

891
01:23:37,638 --> 01:23:40,312
You could've had a new future
with the empire.

892
01:23:57,491 --> 01:24:00,370
There's nowhere to run, princess.

893
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:01,870
The ring.

894
01:24:04,081 --> 01:24:05,628
Give it to me.

895
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:30,820
So many dead over so simple a thing.

896
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:35,158
But why? For what?

897
01:24:35,696 --> 01:24:37,369
Power.

898
01:24:37,614 --> 01:24:40,208
Untold power,
beyond the control of someone like you.

899
01:24:42,202 --> 01:24:43,704
Power...

900
01:25:24,077 --> 01:25:25,750
Captain.

901
01:25:38,759 --> 01:25:40,227
Nyx.

902
01:25:42,721 --> 01:25:46,351
It's over. The daemons are unleashed.

903
01:25:47,351 --> 01:25:49,900
Lucis is fallen.

904
01:25:52,105 --> 01:25:53,448
Surrender the ring.

905
01:25:57,444 --> 01:26:00,118
Plan on giving those kings
a piece of your mind, princess?

906
01:26:01,865 --> 01:26:04,914
You got a destiny to take care of here,
remember?

907
01:26:05,327 --> 01:26:08,422
Besides, didn't anyone tell you?

908
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:12,838
I'm the hero around here.

909
01:26:30,477 --> 01:26:35,028
Show yourselves, kings of Lucis.

910
01:26:39,528 --> 01:26:42,702
You call upon the wards
of this world's future, mortal.

911
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:47,620
And if you come lusting for our power,
you must first stand in our judgement.

912
01:26:47,994 --> 01:26:52,625
How long will you do nothing
whilst Insomnia burns?

913
01:26:53,083 --> 01:26:55,461
Old or new, or whatever it is.

914
01:26:56,545 --> 01:26:58,673
Summon your Wall.

915
01:26:59,339 --> 01:27:00,932
You do not command us.

916
01:27:01,091 --> 01:27:04,265
Yours is not even royal blood.

917
01:27:04,428 --> 01:27:07,523
It does not fall to us to guard your city.

918
01:27:07,681 --> 01:27:09,149
Man is a fool creature...

919
01:27:09,307 --> 01:27:12,356
...clinging to his past
and cowering from his future.

920
01:27:12,519 --> 01:27:16,114
Wasting his strength on bygone days.

921
01:27:16,523 --> 01:27:19,276
And what future are you wards of?

922
01:27:19,443 --> 01:27:20,786
So shortsighted.

923
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:23,288
And cursed never to rise above it.

924
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:24,614
Wait.

925
01:27:24,781 --> 01:27:28,126
I have seen what this brave soul
is prepared to do.

926
01:27:28,285 --> 01:27:31,038
He, too, seeks to safeguard the future.

927
01:27:31,204 --> 01:27:32,456
Your Majesty.

928
01:27:33,206 --> 01:27:37,052
Very well, young king.
We will weigh your Warrior's worth.

929
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:39,755
But our boon does not come cheap.

930
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:46,137
The cost is a life. His or hers.

931
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:47,972
No.

932
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:51,687
To hell with your power.

933
01:27:52,976 --> 01:27:55,024
I'm not here for it.

934
01:27:56,438 --> 01:28:00,614
I only came to tell you, you are no kings.

935
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:04,155
Your worth has been weighed
and found wanting.

936
01:28:04,362 --> 01:28:06,080
Now burn.

937
01:28:12,329 --> 01:28:15,048
You're going to lose your precious ring.

938
01:28:17,834 --> 01:28:20,587
But it's not too late to save it.

939
01:28:21,463 --> 01:28:23,465
You mean to barter for your life.

940
01:28:23,632 --> 01:28:25,600
No, no.

941
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:28,763
My life is nothing.

942
01:28:31,264 --> 01:28:34,643
Giving a future
to those who want to see it...

943
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:38,063
...is everything.

944
01:28:40,065 --> 01:28:43,490
You do not fear,
even if that future is doomed.

945
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:47,748
If that sentiment is not false,
perhaps you are worthy.

946
01:28:48,281 --> 01:28:50,704
We will grant you our light.

947
01:28:50,867 --> 01:28:53,791
But know it will set when the sun rises.

948
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:57,629
And the price for it will be your life.

949
01:28:59,876 --> 01:29:02,846
You guys drive a hard bargain.

950
01:29:05,507 --> 01:29:07,430
<i>Where do I sign?</i>

951
01:29:17,394 --> 01:29:19,613
I could get used to this.

952
01:29:25,193 --> 01:29:26,194
Nyx...

953
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:29,163
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

954
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:31,992
You saved me.

955
01:29:32,576 --> 01:29:33,998
Now I owe you.

956
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:35,829
For a change.

957
01:29:36,955 --> 01:29:38,377
I'm gonna need another favour.

958
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:42,761
Meet Lunafreya Nox Fleuret,
our prince's beloved bride-to-be.

959
01:29:42,919 --> 01:29:45,843
And she has the future of the world
in her hands.

960
01:29:46,006 --> 01:29:49,385
Keep her safe, get her out of Insomnia.

961
01:29:50,093 --> 01:29:52,437
Oh, I almost forgot. You'll need this.

962
01:29:54,431 --> 01:29:57,310
Give Prince Noctis my regards.

963
01:29:58,018 --> 01:30:00,112
Libertus will take care of you from here.

964
01:30:00,312 --> 01:30:03,441
Have a safe journey, Your Highness.

965
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:06,861
- What will come of you?
- What the hell are you doing?

966
01:30:07,444 --> 01:30:09,412
Following the kings' orders.

967
01:30:10,196 --> 01:30:12,699
I will see the ring to Noctis.

968
01:30:13,992 --> 01:30:16,336
The future will be safe. I swear it.

969
01:30:26,504 --> 01:30:29,428
Planning on punching your way
out of the city? Keep it.

970
01:30:30,091 --> 01:30:31,934
- Now we're even.
- No.

971
01:30:32,302 --> 01:30:34,680
We'll settle up
once you're back in Galahd.

972
01:30:34,888 --> 01:30:37,391
Me and everyone else
will be waiting for you.

973
01:30:37,599 --> 01:30:38,976
I'm counting on you...

974
01:30:40,310 --> 01:30:41,357
...hero.

975
01:31:00,163 --> 01:31:03,383
- Buckle up, princess.
- My life is in your hands.

976
01:31:13,176 --> 01:31:16,555
So, the power of the Lucii returns.

977
01:31:17,055 --> 01:31:18,728
No matter. You are out of time.

978
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:20,984
For you, I'll make some.

979
01:31:54,759 --> 01:31:57,137
What can you hope to do?

980
01:31:58,638 --> 01:32:01,562
One man against an empire.

981
01:32:01,725 --> 01:32:03,523
Against the daemons.

982
01:32:03,810 --> 01:32:07,781
How will you save Insomnia
with no wall to protect you?

983
01:32:09,357 --> 01:32:13,362
You've got it all wrong.
I'm not fighting to save Insomnia.

984
01:33:39,405 --> 01:33:44,457
So this is the might of the Old Wall.

985
01:33:44,661 --> 01:33:48,336
Marvellous. Truly marvellous.

986
01:34:59,402 --> 01:35:01,404
Why'd you do it?

987
01:35:01,696 --> 01:35:03,994
Lucis. Niflheim.

988
01:35:04,157 --> 01:35:06,831
It isn't who we fight for that matters,
only what.

989
01:35:07,744 --> 01:35:11,874
We fight for our homes.
That is where our allegiance lies.

990
01:36:31,327 --> 01:36:33,750
That's not something you see every day.

991
01:36:50,013 --> 01:36:53,313
Oh, such a pitiable waste.

992
01:36:53,474 --> 01:36:58,230
All those beautiful city streets,
all laid to unsightly ruin.

993
01:36:58,438 --> 01:37:01,817
- I will return to Niflheim.
- So soon?

994
01:37:02,567 --> 01:37:04,160
The crystal is ours.

995
01:37:05,028 --> 01:37:06,245
Finish this...

996
01:37:06,571 --> 01:37:09,040
...and see the daemons disposed of.

997
01:37:09,198 --> 01:37:10,575
As you command.

998
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:14,833
Such a pitiable waste.

999
01:37:28,176 --> 01:37:30,725
How could you serve the empire?

1000
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:34,019
After everything they did?

1001
01:37:34,682 --> 01:37:38,186
I do not fault them
for taking what was given.

1002
01:37:40,313 --> 01:37:42,907
I fault the man who gave it.

1003
01:37:43,524 --> 01:37:45,492
The man who cowered behind his wall...

1004
01:37:45,693 --> 01:37:49,539
...and abandoned us
to save his throne and his son.

1005
01:37:50,156 --> 01:37:53,160
Give me the ring,
and our homes will be free again.

1006
01:37:53,326 --> 01:37:55,624
The empire has promised it.

1007
01:37:56,329 --> 01:38:00,209
I don't see much of a future
on the other side of that promise.

1008
01:38:00,416 --> 01:38:01,963
Don't be a fool.

1009
01:38:02,126 --> 01:38:03,753
Save your friends.

1010
01:38:05,213 --> 01:38:06,931
Give your dead sister peace.

1011
01:38:08,049 --> 01:38:10,848
What do you fight for if not that?

1012
01:38:56,097 --> 01:38:58,566
Hang on. This could get bumpy.

1013
01:39:08,276 --> 01:39:09,903
Drautos.

1014
01:39:18,244 --> 01:39:19,837
Here, take the wheel.

1015
01:39:28,171 --> 01:39:29,889
Floor it!

1016
01:39:40,183 --> 01:39:42,777
- Libertus!
- Just keep your foot on the gas.

1017
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:05,083
You're all right?

1018
01:40:11,422 --> 01:40:13,595
I'll be waiting for you, hero.

1019
01:40:40,993 --> 01:40:42,620
What of your kings' power now?

1020
01:40:42,787 --> 01:40:46,508
They've given you a burden
you cannot hope to bear.

1021
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,718
I told you before.

1022
01:40:49,919 --> 01:40:53,173
Just wanting doesn't win wars.

1023
01:42:05,745 --> 01:42:11,752
For the honour of my home,
I fought and killed under a king I loathed.

1024
01:42:13,419 --> 01:42:15,888
And still he betrayed me.

1025
01:42:17,173 --> 01:42:19,221
He betrayed us all.

1026
01:42:19,383 --> 01:42:23,104
We fought for the same thing. All of us.

1027
01:42:24,472 --> 01:42:26,474
But you've looked too long on the past.

1028
01:42:27,433 --> 01:42:28,685
You're blind to the future.

1029
01:42:33,773 --> 01:42:35,525
Predictable.

1030
01:42:36,233 --> 01:42:39,988
Unlike you, I learn from history.

1031
01:42:40,446 --> 01:42:43,165
But you're a slave to the past.

1032
01:42:43,949 --> 01:42:46,702
A man's past is his pride.

1033
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:48,462
No.

1034
01:42:48,829 --> 01:42:52,504
My pride is shaping the future.

1035
01:43:05,137 --> 01:43:07,435
Looks like I'm gonna owe him big.

1036
01:43:23,322 --> 01:43:25,074
We're almost there.

1037
01:43:25,658 --> 01:43:26,875
Almost.

1038
01:43:39,547 --> 01:43:42,767
King Regis did what he did for the future.

1039
01:43:43,759 --> 01:43:45,682
Because of him...

1040
01:43:46,512 --> 01:43:49,311
...there's still hope for our homes.

1041
01:43:50,474 --> 01:43:52,272
Hope...

1042
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:03,613
Not the worst way to go.

1043
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:06,328
Rule well, young king.

1044
01:44:26,802 --> 01:44:28,304
We should move.

1045
01:44:30,264 --> 01:44:32,608
It ain't safe here either.

1046
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:36,437
Hey.

1047
01:44:37,396 --> 01:44:39,398
Don't worry about Nyx.

1048
01:44:40,691 --> 01:44:42,864
He can take care of himself.

1049
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:49,412
Come on.

1050
01:44:51,660 --> 01:44:52,912
No.

1051
01:44:55,623 --> 01:44:57,591
We must part ways here.

1052
01:44:58,375 --> 01:44:59,672
What?

1053
01:45:00,377 --> 01:45:04,052
I can hardly travel in secrecy
alongside so great a hero.

1054
01:45:05,049 --> 01:45:08,178
And I, too,
have a promise to keep to Nyx.

1055
01:45:09,303 --> 01:45:11,726
I pray you two see each other again soon.

1056
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:16,147
Yeah.

1057
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:19,738
Me too.

1058
01:45:22,525 --> 01:45:24,778
Thank you, Libertus.

1059
01:45:42,503 --> 01:45:43,720
Hey, queen!

1060
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:47,759
You and the king
are always welcome in Galahd.

1061
01:45:48,801 --> 01:45:51,475
Me and Nyx will be waiting for you.

1062
01:54:48,131 --> 01:54:49,178
<i>It's been some while.</i>

1063
01:54:49,341 --> 01:54:52,561
<i>Do you remember the last time
you saw Lady Lunafreya?</i>

1064
01:54:53,136 --> 01:54:54,638
About 12 years ago.

1065
01:54:54,805 --> 01:54:56,648
That would make you 8?

1066
01:54:56,807 --> 01:54:59,276
- You were kids.
- Hope she hasn't gotten her hopes up.

1067
01:54:59,434 --> 01:55:01,186
Why not? Calm yourself.

1068
01:55:01,395 --> 01:55:03,363
Try and keep it together
when you meet her.

1069
01:55:03,522 --> 01:55:06,459
- She'll expect to see a fine, young prince.
- Tell me something I don't know.

1070
01:55:06,483 --> 01:55:08,736
We don't have time for all that.

1071
01:55:08,902 --> 01:55:11,576
But this is your wedding
we're talking about, Noc.

1072
01:55:11,738 --> 01:55:13,581
Knew that too.

1073
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:16,209
You really gotta calm down.

1074
01:55:17,869 --> 01:55:20,292
What do you mean, "Uh-oh"?

1075
01:55:20,455 --> 01:55:22,207
I think I know.
