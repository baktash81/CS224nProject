1
00:08:04,697 --> 00:08:08,105
As everyone knows, the existence
of mutants was first discovered

2
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:12,805
during the Paris Peace Accords
after the Vietnam war in 1973.

3
00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:17,144
6 days later, we all watched
as one of those mutants...

4
00:08:17,308 --> 00:08:20,704
Erik Lehnsherr, attacked the president
and the cabinet

5
00:08:20,728 --> 00:08:22,296
on the lawn of the White House.

6
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,085
Their lives were saved by
a young mutant, who stopped him.

7
00:08:26,109 --> 00:08:29,550
Now, Lehnsherr escaped and became
the world's most wanted fugitive.

8
00:08:29,574 --> 00:08:31,994
And as for her,
she disappeared as well.

9
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:35,065
But, she has become
the symbol of a new age.

10
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:37,354
The face of a world
that will never...

11
00:08:37,378 --> 00:08:39,170
- ...be the same again.
- You winking at my girl?

12
00:08:39,194 --> 00:08:40,398
Yes, the world is panicked.

13
00:08:40,422 --> 00:08:42,026
- Your girl.
- ... and there is still some prejudice.

14
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,205
- I guess you do look old enough
- But today,

15
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:45,628
-  to be her father.
- mutants are found in all walks of life.

16
00:08:45,652 --> 00:08:47,246
Excuse me, gentlemen, is there
something that you would like

17
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,722
to be sharing with
the rest of the class?

18
00:08:48,746 --> 00:08:50,876
Can I please go to the bathroom.

19
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,218
I think there's something
seriously wrong with my eyes.

20
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:55,650
Fine, Scott, and afterward,
why don't you stop by

21
00:08:55,673 --> 00:08:59,536
the principas office and explain to him
that you're disrupting the class again.

22
00:09:00,132 --> 00:09:01,394
I trust you know the way.

23
00:09:01,418 --> 00:09:03,855
- Yeah, I do.
- Okay.

24
00:09:03,979 --> 00:09:06,672
Oh.
Hang on. Hang on.

25
00:09:10,569 --> 00:09:15,428
Now, I know most of you were what?
Around 7 years old at that time.

26
00:09:24,546 --> 00:09:26,082
Summers!

27
00:09:27,294 --> 00:09:29,372
I know you're in here.

28
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:32,733
Are you crying?

29
00:09:32,757 --> 00:09:34,989
I haven't even kick your ass yet.

30
00:09:36,592 --> 00:09:39,401
Summers.
You want to eyeball my girl?

31
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:44,389
Summers.

32
00:09:47,341 --> 00:09:48,767
Summers.

33
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:10,897
EAST BERLIN

34
00:10:24,141 --> 00:10:25,155
YES!

35
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:26,670
10 fights.

36
00:10:26,694 --> 00:10:28,278
10 victories.

37
00:10:28,302 --> 00:10:30,653
The Winged Warrior.

38
00:10:30,684 --> 00:10:33,306
The Bird of Prey.
The Angel of Death.

39
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,983
ANGEL!

40
00:10:35,007 --> 00:10:37,007
Yes!

41
00:10:41,268 --> 00:10:44,136
A round of applause for fat boy!

42
00:10:44,696 --> 00:10:47,259
Our next opponent

43
00:10:47,283 --> 00:10:49,113
comes directly

44
00:10:49,137 --> 00:10:51,951
from Circus Munich.

45
00:10:51,975 --> 00:10:53,055
FIGHT

46
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:54,490
Ladies and gentlemen.

47
00:10:54,514 --> 00:10:56,993
The one who could face an Angel

48
00:10:57,017 --> 00:10:59,600
is the devil himself!

49
00:11:00,488 --> 00:11:02,659
Presenting.

50
00:11:02,683 --> 00:11:04,600
The amazing,

51
00:11:04,624 --> 00:11:06,832
the fantastic,

52
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,589
Nightcrawler!

53
00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:30,622
Caution.
High voltage.

54
00:11:30,646 --> 00:11:33,016
Sorry, mutants!

55
00:11:47,195 --> 00:11:48,209
Hey.

56
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:50,506
You lost, little girl?

57
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,309
The fight is there.

58
00:11:54,652 --> 00:11:57,655
Fight!
Or they'll kill us both.

59
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,895
It's getting exciting.

60
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:05,298
Ah, you mean this.
Yes.

61
00:12:23,414 --> 00:12:25,631
Nightcrawler!

62
00:12:27,557 --> 00:12:32,416
- Nightcrawler!
- Nightcrawler!

63
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,335
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!

64
00:13:00,897 --> 00:13:02,577
Come with me.

65
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:05,404
Hold it!

66
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,333
They went over there!

67
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,566
You can transform.

68
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:26,013
- You're her, the hero.
- I'm nobody.

69
00:13:26,037 --> 00:13:28,734
I'm not a hero.
Let's get out of here.

70
00:13:30,673 --> 00:13:33,238
PRUSZKOW, POLAND

71
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:50,994
Have a good night, Henryk

72
00:13:51,018 --> 00:13:52,989
Same to you, Milosz.

73
00:14:20,742 --> 00:14:22,110
Hi, my love.

74
00:14:22,134 --> 00:14:23,653
Hi.

75
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:28,455
Good day?

76
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:29,951
Better now.

77
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,344
- Where's Nina?
- At the back.

78
00:14:32,368 --> 00:14:34,233
With her friends.

79
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,056
Where did you learn that song, Papa?

80
00:15:04,951 --> 00:15:07,508
I learned it from my parents.

81
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:10,292
And they learned it from their parents.

82
00:15:10,773 --> 00:15:13,005
And them from theirs.

83
00:15:13,594 --> 00:15:18,039
And one day,
you will sing it to you children too.

84
00:15:19,224 --> 00:15:22,601
What happened to them, your parents?

85
00:15:25,307 --> 00:15:29,646
They were taken from me,
when I was a little boy.

86
00:15:32,282 --> 00:15:36,158
But, they are still here, inside.

87
00:15:37,181 --> 00:15:41,862
And here...
with you.

88
00:15:41,886 --> 00:15:45,020
Is someone going to take you away?

89
00:15:46,427 --> 00:15:47,990
Never.

90
00:16:03,751 --> 00:16:05,575
I guess we're more
alike than we thought.

91
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:07,406
He won't listen to us.

92
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:10,408
- He just... He's been...
- Scott.

93
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,946
Let me try.

94
00:16:24,907 --> 00:16:28,178
XAVIER'S SCHOOL
FOR
GIFTED YOUNGSTERS

95
00:16:28,202 --> 00:16:31,601
Smells pretty old in here.
Is this a school or museum.

96
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:35,537
One more, and last one.

97
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,932
Oh.

98
00:16:47,626 --> 00:16:48,940
Watch where you're going.

99
00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:50,375
I can't...

100
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,809
- What? Who are you talking to?
- Me.

101
00:16:55,038 --> 00:16:57,103
I just heard you in my head.

102
00:16:57,127 --> 00:16:59,898
- I'm telepathic, I read minds.
- Well, stay out of mine.

103
00:16:59,922 --> 00:17:02,865
I don't need some weird girl
creeping around in there.

104
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:05,544
Don't worry, Scott,
there's not much to see.

105
00:17:05,844 --> 00:17:07,971
Hey, wait.
I didn't tell you my name.

106
00:17:07,995 --> 00:17:09,918
No, you didn't.

107
00:17:10,587 --> 00:17:12,325
Alex Summers?

108
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:14,091
Hank McCoy!

109
00:17:14,115 --> 00:17:16,868
Whoa.
What happen to the big blue... furry you?

110
00:17:16,893 --> 00:17:19,375
I, keep it under control now.

111
00:17:19,951 --> 00:17:21,964
- This is my brother, Scott.
- Hey, Scott.

112
00:17:21,988 --> 00:17:24,531
I'm Hank McCoy.
I'm one of the teachers here.

113
00:17:26,655 --> 00:17:27,884
Where's the Professor?

114
00:17:27,908 --> 00:17:33,915
... to break forth bloodily, then the past
must be obliterated and a new start made.

115
00:17:33,939 --> 00:17:37,326
Let us now start fresh
without remembrance,

116
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:41,601
rather than live forward and
backward at the same time.

117
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,648
Now, what are the aggrieve things
that the author meant

118
00:17:44,672 --> 00:17:47,507
when he wrote all that?
He...

119
00:17:48,032 --> 00:17:50,942
That's going to be your
assignment for tomorrow.

120
00:17:50,966 --> 00:17:54,278
Top marks, everyone.
Class dismiss.

121
00:17:54,528 --> 00:17:57,349
- Alex, it's good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

122
00:17:57,373 --> 00:17:59,176
You look... well.
It's been a while.

123
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,023
It has.
You're not too bad yourself.

124
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:02,124
Thank you.

125
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:04,437
This is my brother, Scott.

126
00:18:04,461 --> 00:18:07,355
Hello, Scott.
Welcome to the school for the gifted.

127
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:10,537
Yeah.
It doesn't exactly feel like a gift.

128
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:13,258
It never does, not at first.

129
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:19,324
The first step in understanding
one's power is learning the extent of it.

130
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,440
Only then, can we begin the process
of teaching you how to control it.

131
00:18:22,464 --> 00:18:24,433
If you do decide to stay,

132
00:18:24,457 --> 00:18:27,197
I can promise you that by
the time you are done here

133
00:18:27,221 --> 00:18:31,241
you'll be able to go back into the world
and play a stable productive partner.

134
00:18:31,265 --> 00:18:33,115
Why don't you take your bandages off
and we can have a look

135
00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:35,029
at what we're dealing with here.

136
00:18:35,053 --> 00:18:38,464
Alex, would you line him up.
Face him in the right direction if you will.

137
00:18:38,488 --> 00:18:40,044
There's a target just across the water.

138
00:18:40,068 --> 00:18:42,407
When you open your eyes,
try and hit that.

139
00:18:45,281 --> 00:18:48,988
You can open your eyes, Scott.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

140
00:18:49,042 --> 00:18:50,383
It's quite...

141
00:18:56,422 --> 00:18:57,503
Get back!

142
00:18:57,527 --> 00:18:59,207
Get back.
Get back.

143
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,265
Whoa!

144
00:19:03,739 --> 00:19:06,829
My grandfather planted that tree
when he was 5 years old.

145
00:19:06,853 --> 00:19:10,569
I used to swing from
the branches then myself.

146
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,751
I think that was probably
my favourite tree.

147
00:19:16,636 --> 00:19:19,955
- Does that mean I'm expel?
- On the contrary.

148
00:19:20,728 --> 00:19:22,485
You're enrolled.

149
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:11,009
Do you sell carpets?

150
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:13,286
You cannot come in here.

151
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,155
The carpet is for sale?

152
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:16,742
I said...

153
00:24:08,397 --> 00:24:10,513
Earthquake!

154
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:55,012
Back to bed, please, my darling.

155
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:56,609
- Back to bed.
- She's doing it again.

156
00:24:56,633 --> 00:24:59,421
Back to bed, please, everyone.
Jessie, back to bed, please.

157
00:24:59,445 --> 00:25:01,155
Come on, now.
Spitzbolt, back to bed.

158
00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:03,761
Carrie Anne, come on, now.
Back to bed.

159
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:14,342
- I've never seen her like this.
- Well, I do.

160
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,509
Don't let any of the children
come this way.

161
00:25:36,532 --> 00:25:37,979
Jean.

162
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:00,859
Jean!

163
00:26:02,063 --> 00:26:04,625
JEAN !!!

164
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,096
I...
I saw the end of the world.

165
00:26:14,335 --> 00:26:18,040
I could feel all this death.

166
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,488
Nope.
It was just a dream.

167
00:26:21,512 --> 00:26:24,682
- But, it felt real.
- I know.

168
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:28,175
Your mind is the most powerful
I've ever seen.

169
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:31,016
- It can convince itself...
- No, it's not

170
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,416
just a mind reading or a telekinesis,
it's something else.

171
00:26:36,185 --> 00:26:43,043
Some... dark power inside
and it's growing, like a fire.

172
00:26:43,067 --> 00:26:47,746
- I thought I was getting better.
- You are. You will.

173
00:26:47,993 --> 00:26:49,640
- You just have to be patient.
- No. No.

174
00:26:49,664 --> 00:26:52,474
You don't know what it's like
to be afraid to shut your eyes.

175
00:26:52,498 --> 00:26:56,839
- To be trapped inside your own head.
- Oh, but I think I do.

176
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:00,814
It wasn't so long ago,
that I was plagued by voices of myself.

177
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:04,723
All their suffering.
All their pain.

178
00:27:04,747 --> 00:27:06,836
Their secrets.

179
00:27:09,525 --> 00:27:12,677
I'm afraid one day
I am going to hurt someone.

180
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:16,886
Lie back.

181
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:30,601
Everyone fears that
which they do not understand.

182
00:27:31,888 --> 00:27:34,526
You will learn to control your powers.

183
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:39,385
And when you do,
you'll have nothing to fear.

184
00:27:40,908 --> 00:27:42,698
Her nightmares were different this time.

185
00:27:42,722 --> 00:27:45,413
Well, it could have count for something
I saw while I was in my lab earlier.

186
00:27:45,437 --> 00:27:47,914
There was some kind of tremor.
Like an energy surge.

187
00:27:47,938 --> 00:27:50,898
- I picked it up on one of my meters.
- You're saying that Jean created it.

188
00:27:50,922 --> 00:27:52,385
No, I'm saying something else did.

189
00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:54,666
Maybe she was reacting to it,
I don't know.

190
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,436
But, the Epicenter was
half way around the world.

191
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,963
- Half way around the world?
- Yeah.

192
00:27:57,987 --> 00:27:59,551
That's why I was hoping
you could take a look.

193
00:27:59,575 --> 00:28:01,589
Let's see what we can find.

194
00:28:04,118 --> 00:28:06,366
Welcome Professor.

195
00:28:16,149 --> 00:28:18,479
The source came from Cairo.

196
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:21,654
I'll put in the coordinates.

197
00:28:44,813 --> 00:28:47,882
I got to get out of here
and give them a report.

198
00:28:50,535 --> 00:28:51,731
What?
What is it?

199
00:28:51,755 --> 00:28:55,354
Something happened here,
I can tell it's real.

200
00:28:56,582 --> 00:28:59,358
- It's her.
- Who?

201
00:29:00,342 --> 00:29:01,712
- Moira.
- What?

202
00:29:01,736 --> 00:29:03,640
- Moira MacTaggert?
- Mm-hm.

203
00:29:03,663 --> 00:29:06,054
- And give me the details?
- Well, she looks amazing.

204
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:09,459
- She's barely aged a day.
- No. I meant...

205
00:29:09,592 --> 00:29:11,964
What is she doing there?
What's the CIA doing with this?

206
00:29:11,996 --> 00:29:15,828
She's going back to Langley
to deliver a report.

207
00:29:15,938 --> 00:29:17,176
I'm going to go there,

208
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,269
see if she knows something
about the tremor.

209
00:29:19,294 --> 00:29:20,860
You'll wind up seeing Moira.

210
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:24,445
I want to go check her out,
check out... the situation.

211
00:29:27,635 --> 00:29:29,532
Moira MacTaggert.

212
00:29:30,991 --> 00:29:33,420
It's like a ghost from the past.

213
00:29:35,586 --> 00:29:37,435
You did a good thing,
you saved that man.

214
00:29:37,459 --> 00:29:39,124
That's not the point.

215
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,106
If I'm exposed,
we're all exposed.

216
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,774
We have to go.

217
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:44,757
This is our home.

218
00:29:44,781 --> 00:29:46,518
This is our daughter's home.

219
00:29:46,542 --> 00:29:48,836
We are our home.

220
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:53,222
I told you who I was,
the first night I met you.

221
00:29:53,246 --> 00:29:57,571
I trusted you then.
I need you to trust me now.

222
00:29:57,901 --> 00:30:00,570
We can't stay here anymore.

223
00:30:04,855 --> 00:30:06,692
I'll get Nina.

224
00:30:08,512 --> 00:30:10,241
Sweetheart?

225
00:30:20,113 --> 00:30:21,626
She's not in her room.

226
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,707
And I don't see her
at the back.

227
00:32:50,849 --> 00:32:53,185
Nina.

228
00:32:53,698 --> 00:32:56,982
Nina.
Nina.

229
00:32:57,006 --> 00:32:58,007
Please!

230
00:33:01,127 --> 00:33:02,537
Please.

231
00:33:04,955 --> 00:33:06,365
- Nina.
- Please.

232
00:33:07,793 --> 00:33:12,776
I'm not letting them take you!
I'm not letting them take you!

233
00:33:20,143 --> 00:33:21,425
Nina.

234
00:33:22,287 --> 00:33:23,663
No.

235
00:33:24,228 --> 00:33:26,304
No, Nina!

236
00:33:41,917 --> 00:33:42,923
Nina?

237
00:33:42,946 --> 00:33:44,540
Nina.
No.

238
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,797
Don't...
Please. Please. Please.

239
00:33:46,821 --> 00:33:48,684
What have you done?

240
00:34:00,061 --> 00:34:02,441
Not my babies.

241
00:34:06,648 --> 00:34:08,996
Not my babies.

242
00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:52,180
IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT FROM ME?

243
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:56,208
Is this what I am?

244
00:35:02,556 --> 00:35:04,678
Is this what I am?

245
00:37:31,826 --> 00:37:33,198
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

246
00:37:33,222 --> 00:37:35,358
So, you really haven't
seen her in all these years?

247
00:37:35,382 --> 00:37:37,622
You never looked her up?
Not even in Cerebro?

248
00:37:37,652 --> 00:37:38,849
Alex.

249
00:37:38,873 --> 00:37:40,302
Who do you take me for?
Some kind of pervert?

250
00:37:40,326 --> 00:37:41,906
I...
Yes, I looked her up once.

251
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:44,222
Twice.
But, not in a long time. Alright?

252
00:37:44,246 --> 00:37:45,905
How'd you leave things?

253
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:48,154
- Any hard feelings?
- Not likely.

254
00:37:48,178 --> 00:37:50,062
Everybody take a break.

255
00:37:51,278 --> 00:37:54,055
I wiped her mind off
all memories of us.

256
00:37:54,078 --> 00:37:56,957
The beach, Cuba,
that whole time.

257
00:37:56,982 --> 00:37:58,989
It's so long ago, Alex.

258
00:37:59,013 --> 00:38:01,405
Before the world knew about mutants,
I have felt...

259
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:04,272
it was the best thing for her.

260
00:38:04,296 --> 00:38:05,901
And for you?

261
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,670
It didn't really matter
what's best for me.

262
00:38:13,937 --> 00:38:17,948
Moira MacTaggert.
Hello.

263
00:38:21,672 --> 00:38:23,667
Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm Professor...

264
00:38:23,691 --> 00:38:25,053
Charles Xavier

265
00:38:25,084 --> 00:38:27,397
- I know exactly who you are
- You do?

266
00:38:27,421 --> 00:38:28,896
Of course I do.

267
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:34,227
I've read all of your papers.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

268
00:38:34,484 --> 00:38:36,226
- Moira MacTaggert.
- Alex Summers.

269
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:39,322
Have a seat.
Just, throw that on the floor.

270
00:38:39,777 --> 00:38:41,020
It's wonderful to see you again.

271
00:38:41,044 --> 00:38:43,142
To-To meet you again
for the first time.

272
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:45,828
I...
You got a son?

273
00:38:46,641 --> 00:38:49,813
- Yes.
- Does he have a husband or...

274
00:38:51,289 --> 00:38:52,859
Do you have a husband?

275
00:38:52,883 --> 00:38:54,918
I had a husband, but...

276
00:38:54,942 --> 00:38:57,200
It's hard to do this job and
make it home in time for dinner.

277
00:38:57,224 --> 00:38:58,156
Good.
Good.

278
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,428
We all make choices, right?

279
00:39:00,452 --> 00:39:02,687
Yes, we do.

280
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:07,118
- Professor.
- Yes?

281
00:39:07,298 --> 00:39:10,365
Yes. I was... we were hoping

282
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:13,694
that you would tell us about
what happened yesterday in Egypt.

283
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:16,304
I'm afraid that's classified information.

284
00:39:16,328 --> 00:39:19,040
And, I don't mean to be rude,
but...

285
00:39:19,393 --> 00:39:21,396
How did you get in here?

286
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,797
I have level 5 clearance.

287
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,897
Ever since the world found out
about mutants in '73,

288
00:39:27,921 --> 00:39:31,427
there have been cults who see them
as some kind of second coming

289
00:39:31,451 --> 00:39:33,088
or sign of god.

290
00:39:33,112 --> 00:39:35,290
I was tracking one of them.

291
00:39:35,314 --> 00:39:38,173
They called themselves,
Ashir En Sabah Nur,

292
00:39:38,197 --> 00:39:41,654
named after an ancient being
they believed to be the world's first.

293
00:39:41,678 --> 00:39:43,198
The world first's what?

294
00:39:43,222 --> 00:39:45,109
The world's first mutant.

295
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:47,215
I thought mutants didn't
evolve until this century

296
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:49,858
That's the common theory, yes.
But, these guys believe that

297
00:39:49,882 --> 00:39:52,884
the first mutant was born
ten of thousands of years ago.

298
00:39:52,908 --> 00:39:55,228
And they believe he will rise again.

299
00:39:55,342 --> 00:39:59,289
They've been searching ancient sites
all round the world for clues.

300
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:04,236
These hieroglyphs described a specific set
of powers greater than any man can possess.

301
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,186
They think he lived all that time?

302
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:08,208
Yes and no.
They believe he had the ability

303
00:40:08,232 --> 00:40:10,797
to transfer his consciousness
from body to body,

304
00:40:10,821 --> 00:40:13,719
and whenever he was close to death
he would just take on a new body.

305
00:40:13,743 --> 00:40:17,152
So, these may have been the bodies of
mutants enabling him to take their powers

306
00:40:17,176 --> 00:40:19,595
amassing varies abilities over the years.

307
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:22,307
- An all powerful mutant.
- Exactly.

308
00:40:22,331 --> 00:40:26,581
And wherever this being was,
he always had 4 principle followers.

309
00:40:26,605 --> 00:40:29,891
Disciples.
Protectors he would imbue their powers.

310
00:40:29,915 --> 00:40:33,362
Like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

311
00:40:33,386 --> 00:40:36,931
- He got that one from the Bible.
- Or the Bible got it from him.

312
00:40:36,955 --> 00:40:42,027
And wherever he ruled,
eventually, it would end in disaster.

313
00:40:42,051 --> 00:40:47,358
Cataclysm.
Some kind of... Apocalypse.

314
00:40:48,005 --> 00:40:50,148
The end of the world.

315
00:40:51,172 --> 00:40:53,060
I must say, Apollo.

316
00:40:54,017 --> 00:40:56,511
The way you ape
human behavior is remarkable.

317
00:40:56,536 --> 00:40:58,001
Get out.
Come one.

318
00:40:58,025 --> 00:40:59,685
Come on.
Come on.

319
00:41:03,775 --> 00:41:06,873
I've never seen another
mutant in this city.

320
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:09,837
Do you speak Egyptian?
Arab?

321
00:41:09,861 --> 00:41:11,434
English?

322
00:41:14,477 --> 00:41:16,228
Great fighter.

323
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:20,719
She's my hero.
I want to be like her.

324
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:25,333
There's some food here,
not much.

325
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:28,386
I don't believe it.
You love me.

326
00:41:28,907 --> 00:41:32,226
Love you?
Be logical.

327
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:35,880
I'm not some simple
shepherdess you can awe.

328
00:41:36,601 --> 00:41:40,731
Why, I could no more love you than
I could love a new species of...

329
00:41:40,944 --> 00:41:42,638
Bacteria.

330
00:41:43,048 --> 00:41:44,788
What are you doing?

331
00:41:46,278 --> 00:41:48,936
Learning.

332
00:41:55,655 --> 00:41:59,757
In the streets there is outrage against
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan...

333
00:41:59,781 --> 00:42:02,076
The brotherhood of our kind.

334
00:42:03,175 --> 00:42:05,578
One of them was held in Boston.

335
00:42:06,213 --> 00:42:10,514
Since the act in the nuclear weapons,
the United States does not start fights...

336
00:42:10,538 --> 00:42:11,643
Weapons.

337
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:14,080
Never before has man
possess so much power.

338
00:42:14,104 --> 00:42:17,898
With Soviet Union and the
United States being superpowers...

339
00:42:18,704 --> 00:42:21,939
Superpowers.

340
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:26,652
The weak have taken the Earth.

341
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,204
For this, I was betrayed.

342
00:42:30,228 --> 00:42:32,602
False gods.

343
00:42:33,132 --> 00:42:35,244
Idols.

344
00:42:36,118 --> 00:42:38,308
No more.

345
00:42:41,251 --> 00:42:45,148
I have returned.

346
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:50,321
The new tomorrow,
that starts today.

347
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:56,271
Where did you come from?

348
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:06,301
The time before man lost his way.

349
00:43:06,692 --> 00:43:10,530
Well.
Welcome to the 80s.

350
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:14,439
This world needs to be...

351
00:43:14,788 --> 00:43:16,681
Purged.

352
00:43:17,256 --> 00:43:18,634
What?

353
00:43:19,021 --> 00:43:20,834
Saved.

354
00:43:22,731 --> 00:43:26,549
You can't save the world,
just going around killing people.

355
00:43:26,573 --> 00:43:30,210
There's laws, system and place
for that kind of thing.

356
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:37,080
My child, why do you enslave yourself?

357
00:43:40,503 --> 00:43:44,742
- What are you doing?
- Making you stronger.

358
00:43:45,037 --> 00:43:47,621
My goddess.

359
00:43:56,911 --> 00:43:59,146
Yes.

360
00:44:01,683 --> 00:44:03,297
You were right.

361
00:44:03,664 --> 00:44:05,767
The time has passed.

362
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:09,100
There is no room for gods.

363
00:44:12,718 --> 00:44:16,200
- Why can't I go with you.
- I told you, I work alone.

364
00:44:22,688 --> 00:44:24,081
Wait there.

365
00:44:25,145 --> 00:44:29,148
Always good to see your face,
even if it's not yours.

366
00:44:29,172 --> 00:44:31,399
Papers and passage for me.

367
00:44:32,967 --> 00:44:35,436
Where is the gentleman going,
may I ask?

368
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,207
Don't matter, don't care.

369
00:44:37,231 --> 00:44:39,701
I just saved his life, what
he does with it is up to him.

370
00:44:39,725 --> 00:44:42,724
- Mystique, the mercenary.
- Don't call me that.

371
00:44:42,748 --> 00:44:44,815
No matter how much you
pretend to be someone else,

372
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:46,418
Caliban knows who you are.

373
00:44:46,442 --> 00:44:50,526
If there's anything worth knowing
about mutants, Caliban knows it.

374
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:52,575
Mystique.

375
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:55,688
Why don't you ask your psychics
what will happen if you keep pushing me.

376
00:44:55,712 --> 00:44:57,445
What will happen?

377
00:45:00,578 --> 00:45:02,968
Psylocke gets a little jealous.

378
00:45:04,154 --> 00:45:07,120
- 'Cause Caliban likes you.
- Caliban likes money.

379
00:45:07,144 --> 00:45:11,270
Caliban likes you so much,
he wants to give you free information.

380
00:45:11,294 --> 00:45:13,429
About an old friend.

381
00:45:13,453 --> 00:45:15,281
From back when you have friends.

382
00:45:15,305 --> 00:45:20,056
Do you remember, Erik Lehnsherr?

383
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,942
My girls had a flash
of him in Poland.

384
00:45:21,966 --> 00:45:24,121
He left quite a few
dead bodies in his wake,

385
00:45:24,145 --> 00:45:27,190
including his wife and daughter.

386
00:45:27,214 --> 00:45:29,170
Should be on the news soon enough.

387
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:32,755
But...
Caliban gives you a little head start.

388
00:45:33,751 --> 00:45:35,041
How fast are you?

389
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,709
- How fast?
- How far can you cover?

390
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:38,187
Uh, as far as I can see,

391
00:45:38,211 --> 00:45:40,384
- or if I've been there before.
- Come with me Crawler.

392
00:45:40,408 --> 00:45:44,713
Actually it's Nightcrawler,
and my real name is...

393
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:47,263
... Kurt Wagner.

394
00:45:51,178 --> 00:45:53,450
The lenses are made up of some
ruby quartz I have lying around.

395
00:45:53,474 --> 00:45:55,177
They should be able to refract
your optic beams

396
00:45:55,201 --> 00:45:57,815
and keep them contain
within their own vector fields.

397
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,265
Try them on.

398
00:46:13,044 --> 00:46:15,263
Okay, go ahead.

399
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,662
Wait. Wait.
Sorry, no.

400
00:46:18,848 --> 00:46:19,650
Okay.

401
00:46:19,674 --> 00:46:20,632
- Now?
- Yeah, you're good.

402
00:46:20,656 --> 00:46:21,861
Alright.

403
00:46:25,531 --> 00:46:26,707
Whoa.

404
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:29,579
I can see.

405
00:46:29,603 --> 00:46:30,894
Thank you.

406
00:46:31,059 --> 00:46:32,832
Professor, thank you.
You're a genius.

407
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:35,994
No, I'm... not a professor.

408
00:46:36,018 --> 00:46:37,277
I wish.

409
00:46:38,857 --> 00:46:40,177
Who's that?

410
00:46:42,106 --> 00:46:43,688
I believe you two have met,
that's Jean Grey.

411
00:46:43,712 --> 00:46:45,236
You bumped into her
when you arrived.

412
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,635
- Wait, that's her?
- Yeah.

413
00:46:52,508 --> 00:46:53,862
Hey.

414
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:57,748
You can see.

415
00:46:58,222 --> 00:47:00,688
Yeah.
It's not as bad as I thought here.

416
00:47:00,712 --> 00:47:03,102
- Freak.
- Some one should warn that new kid.

417
00:47:03,126 --> 00:47:04,955
They're still scared of me.

418
00:47:04,979 --> 00:47:06,998
Hey, I have special glasses now!

419
00:47:07,022 --> 00:47:09,577
They're not scared of you,
they're scared of me.

420
00:47:10,489 --> 00:47:14,004
You're not the only one who
can't full control your powers.

421
00:47:14,679 --> 00:47:15,790
Wait, so...

422
00:47:15,814 --> 00:47:19,765
Last night, when the house shook...
That was you?

423
00:47:19,789 --> 00:47:23,219
Sorry to break it to you, but you are
not the biggest freak of this school.

424
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,079
Well.
That's a first.

425
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,021
Raven.

426
00:47:44,167 --> 00:47:46,117
Wow.
Uh.

427
00:47:46,141 --> 00:47:49,397
- I... You're...
- Not blue?

428
00:47:49,421 --> 00:47:51,389
It's like you and I have
that in common now.

429
00:47:51,413 --> 00:47:54,420
No. No, I meant...
You're...

430
00:47:55,104 --> 00:47:56,704
You're back.

431
00:47:57,969 --> 00:47:59,913
I never thought I would
see you here again.

432
00:48:01,004 --> 00:48:03,008
Yeah, me neither.

433
00:48:05,643 --> 00:48:07,112
I'm blue.

434
00:48:07,261 --> 00:48:08,613
I'm Kurt.

435
00:48:08,637 --> 00:48:10,253
Oh, right.

436
00:48:10,277 --> 00:48:12,184
Kurt Wagner.

437
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:13,656
Welcome.

438
00:48:16,202 --> 00:48:17,912
We're closed.

439
00:48:20,923 --> 00:48:23,430
I knew I felt
a chill in the air.

440
00:48:25,623 --> 00:48:26,770
How did you get in here?

441
00:48:26,794 --> 00:48:28,085
We let ourselves in.

442
00:48:28,109 --> 00:48:29,675
We are looking for mutants.

443
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:32,764
Since you know where to find them,
we came here.

444
00:48:32,788 --> 00:48:35,124
Caliban doesn't know you.

445
00:48:35,355 --> 00:48:39,051
We are looking for the strongest.

446
00:48:42,198 --> 00:48:44,934
- Everything alright?
- I'm fine, Psylocke.

447
00:48:45,258 --> 00:48:47,544
How much money do you have?

448
00:48:47,568 --> 00:48:49,138
None.

449
00:48:49,579 --> 00:48:51,310
Like Caliban said...

450
00:48:51,334 --> 00:48:54,042
We are closed, yeah?

451
00:48:54,762 --> 00:48:57,665
I need your help, my child.

452
00:48:57,984 --> 00:49:00,186
You don't look Caliban's father.

453
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:02,744
Maybe a little bit up here.

454
00:49:09,503 --> 00:49:11,580
You are all my children.

455
00:49:11,604 --> 00:49:15,473
And you are lost, because
you follow blind leaders.

456
00:49:15,497 --> 00:49:18,053
These false gods.

457
00:49:18,077 --> 00:49:21,041
Systems of the weak.

458
00:49:21,065 --> 00:49:23,752
They ruined my world...

459
00:49:23,776 --> 00:49:25,682
... no more.

460
00:49:32,959 --> 00:49:34,834
What do you want?

461
00:49:44,049 --> 00:49:45,961
I want you...

462
00:49:46,304 --> 00:49:50,543
To feel the full reach
of your power.

463
00:49:54,496 --> 00:49:57,528
You've only have a taste
of your true strength.

464
00:49:57,552 --> 00:50:01,749
Unlike others who seek to control you.

465
00:50:01,917 --> 00:50:04,472
I want to set you free.

466
00:50:13,585 --> 00:50:16,402
I know the kind of mutants
you are looking for.

467
00:50:17,892 --> 00:50:20,107
And I know where to find them.

468
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:25,004
It's my first time in America.

469
00:50:25,028 --> 00:50:27,036
I am very excited
to see your culture.

470
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,999
Well, you are not
going to see it here.

471
00:50:29,023 --> 00:50:32,303
The only thing American about this place
is that it used to be British.

472
00:50:32,304 --> 00:50:33,833
This is Scott.

473
00:50:33,834 --> 00:50:35,717
He is new here too.

474
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,999
And I'm already up
for a prison break.

475
00:50:39,437 --> 00:50:41,793
What do you say we take this
blue guy on a little field trip?

476
00:50:41,817 --> 00:50:44,230
I'm sure there's a mall
around here somewhere.

477
00:50:44,254 --> 00:50:46,010
What's a mall?

478
00:50:46,707 --> 00:50:49,728
What's a mall? Alright.
Now it's a matter of national pride.

479
00:50:49,752 --> 00:50:51,947
- Civic duty.
- Scott.

480
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:54,790
What? You've been cooped up
here for a long time.

481
00:50:54,814 --> 00:50:57,046
And the Professor is not even home.

482
00:50:57,558 --> 00:50:59,855
I-I like to go to the mall.

483
00:51:01,389 --> 00:51:03,725
- Try it.
- Alright.

484
00:51:03,749 --> 00:51:05,619
Where does he keep his cars?

485
00:51:18,095 --> 00:51:19,709
Faire pisse.

486
00:51:19,734 --> 00:51:22,244
Or should I say, "Piss off"?

487
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:29,789
- This is the guy?
- He used to be.

488
00:51:29,813 --> 00:51:31,988
I didn't know his wings were...

489
00:51:35,784 --> 00:51:37,119
Let's get out of here.

490
00:51:37,143 --> 00:51:39,221
His fighting days are done.

491
00:51:39,245 --> 00:51:40,975
No, they're not.

492
00:51:46,334 --> 00:51:48,451
What the hell is this?

493
00:51:50,481 --> 00:51:52,411
I want to give you something.

494
00:51:52,435 --> 00:51:55,408
There is nothing you can
give me that I want.

495
00:51:55,432 --> 00:51:57,629
Yes, there is.

496
00:52:11,306 --> 00:52:14,467
Yes, my son.

497
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:29,713
Yes.

498
00:52:39,029 --> 00:52:42,557
Rise, my angel.

499
00:52:44,773 --> 00:52:46,838
Rise.

500
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:20,942
Hypersonic, blast resistance,
stealth technology.

501
00:53:20,966 --> 00:53:22,690
That's impressive.

502
00:53:22,853 --> 00:53:25,655
How are you ever gonna
get it out of here?

503
00:53:26,744 --> 00:53:30,143
Well, that's okay. I built a
retractable roof into the basketball court.

504
00:53:31,144 --> 00:53:33,689
Hank, you're building
a warplane down here.

505
00:53:33,713 --> 00:53:35,649
After what happened in Washington,

506
00:53:35,673 --> 00:53:37,540
I thought we would come back
to start the X-Men.

507
00:53:37,564 --> 00:53:40,064
Like we always talked about, but...

508
00:53:40,088 --> 00:53:42,337
Charles wants students
not soldiers.

509
00:53:42,361 --> 00:53:45,341
He thinks the best of people.
He has hope.

510
00:53:45,365 --> 00:53:46,875
And you?

511
00:53:47,703 --> 00:53:49,831
You know, I think
we should hope for the best.

512
00:53:49,855 --> 00:53:52,759
And prepare for the worst.

513
00:53:52,783 --> 00:53:55,048
I think the world needs the X-Men.

514
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:59,631
Maybe, now that you're back
you can help me convince him

515
00:53:59,655 --> 00:54:02,034
- ... we can start it together.
- Hank, I'm here about Erik.

516
00:54:03,085 --> 00:54:06,507
Right. Erik.
Yeah, of course.

517
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,490
Of course.

518
00:54:07,514 --> 00:54:09,867
I think he might be in
some kind of trouble.

519
00:54:09,891 --> 00:54:11,636
Real trouble.

520
00:54:12,596 --> 00:54:14,453
Isn't he always?

521
00:54:47,277 --> 00:54:49,371
Some of you spoke to the police...

522
00:54:49,395 --> 00:54:52,958
About what your believed
you witnessed here yesterday.

523
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:57,715
You want to know my past?

524
00:54:58,541 --> 00:55:00,790
Know who I am?

525
00:55:01,661 --> 00:55:03,742
See what I can do?

526
00:55:05,625 --> 00:55:07,267
I'll show you.

527
00:55:09,587 --> 00:55:13,167
Think about the person
you love most in your life.

528
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:16,496
Your wife.

529
00:55:18,749 --> 00:55:20,327
Mother.

530
00:55:22,915 --> 00:55:24,647
Daughter.

531
00:55:28,623 --> 00:55:32,618
Now that person will know what
it is to lose someone they love.

532
00:55:32,969 --> 00:55:35,293
And live with that pain.

533
00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:39,442
- Forever.
- Henryk, please.

534
00:55:39,466 --> 00:55:41,212
Don't do it.

535
00:55:41,878 --> 00:55:43,965
My name isn't Henryk.

536
00:55:47,422 --> 00:55:49,695
My name is Magneto.

537
00:56:09,542 --> 00:56:11,551
Who the fuck are you?

538
00:56:13,653 --> 00:56:15,557
Stay back.

539
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:19,143
Whoever you are,

540
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:22,577
don't try to stop me
from killing these men.

541
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:41,899
I'm not here for them.

542
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:45,366
I'm here for you.

543
00:57:01,566 --> 00:57:03,405
Come and see.

544
00:57:35,046 --> 00:57:38,209
This is where your power was born.

545
00:57:39,984 --> 00:57:43,102
And this is where your
people were slaughtered.

546
00:57:57,342 --> 00:57:59,717
You shouldn't have brought me here.

547
00:58:01,628 --> 00:58:03,281
Why?

548
00:58:04,961 --> 00:58:07,418
Are you afraid to be here?

549
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:11,539
You can't escape it, Erik.

550
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:14,752
Who are you?

551
00:58:14,776 --> 00:58:18,305
Elohim, Shen, Ra.

552
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:22,319
I've been called many names
over many lifetimes.

553
00:58:22,998 --> 00:58:25,793
I am born of death.

554
00:58:25,817 --> 00:58:30,237
I was there to spark and fan
the flame of man's awakening,

555
00:58:30,261 --> 00:58:32,856
to spin the wheel of civilization.

556
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,239
And when the forest would grow rank
and in need of clearing for new growth...

557
00:58:37,471 --> 00:58:41,579
I was there to set it ablaze.

558
00:58:42,209 --> 00:58:43,792
Where were you?

559
00:58:43,816 --> 00:58:46,493
When my father and mother
were slaughtered in this place?

560
00:58:46,517 --> 00:58:47,819
Asleep.

561
00:58:47,843 --> 00:58:50,304
Trapped in darkness.

562
00:58:50,328 --> 00:58:52,184
I was not there for you, my son.

563
00:58:52,208 --> 00:58:54,665
But I am here now.

564
00:58:54,689 --> 00:58:58,314
You don't know your own strength,
but I do.

565
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:03,734
Reach down.

566
00:59:03,758 --> 00:59:06,838
Feel the metal in the ground.

567
00:59:07,202 --> 00:59:10,401
Reach, as deep as you can.

568
00:59:12,651 --> 00:59:17,974
You'll find you have the power
to move the very Earth itself.

569
00:59:49,251 --> 00:59:54,703
Everything they've built will fall!

570
00:59:55,209 --> 00:59:58,714
And from the ashes of their world,

571
00:59:59,036 --> 01:00:02,350
we'll build a better one!

572
01:00:28,044 --> 01:00:32,346
Lehnsherr was identified yesterday
in this small town, in central Poland.

573
01:00:32,377 --> 01:00:36,206
Leaders from all communities are
urging their citizens to remain calm

574
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:38,453
as police and armed forces
are mobilizing

575
01:00:38,477 --> 01:00:40,761
to find Lehnsherr before
he can strike again.

576
01:00:40,785 --> 01:00:43,737
If anyone has information about Lehnsherr,

577
01:00:43,761 --> 01:00:46,009
or as he is also known as Magneto.

578
01:00:46,033 --> 01:00:48,656
Contact you local authorities immediately.

579
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:50,500
And proceed with caution.

580
01:00:50,524 --> 01:00:53,791
- As he is considered extremely dangerous.
- Peter.

581
01:00:53,815 --> 01:00:55,259
What's up?

582
01:00:58,114 --> 01:01:01,361
- I'm just checking on you.
- I'm good, playing Pac-Man.

583
01:01:06,487 --> 01:01:08,207
Are you sure
you weren't watching this?

584
01:01:08,208 --> 01:01:12,092
The world was celebrating 10 years of
peace between mutants and man kind.

585
01:01:12,116 --> 01:01:14,341
You're going after him, aren't you?

586
01:01:15,331 --> 01:01:17,937
You wanted me to get out
of the house more, right?

587
01:01:18,204 --> 01:01:21,028
I can't stop you.
Nobody can.

588
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:23,407
Trust me.
This won't end well.

589
01:01:24,042 --> 01:01:26,202
Nothing does with him.

590
01:01:29,308 --> 01:01:30,939
I'm not afraid of him.

591
01:01:30,963 --> 01:01:32,709
You should be.

592
01:01:41,221 --> 01:01:43,743
XAVIER'S SCHOOL
FOR GIFTED YOUNGSTERS

593
01:01:57,613 --> 01:02:00,342
I've read so much about this place.

594
01:02:00,931 --> 01:02:04,048
But being here,
it actually seems kind of...

595
01:02:04,072 --> 01:02:05,440
... familiar.

596
01:02:05,464 --> 01:02:07,977
- It's strange.
- It could be quite.

597
01:02:08,001 --> 01:02:09,868
Shall we?

598
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:10,601
NOW PLAYING
THE RETURN OF THE JEDI

599
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:12,608
I'm just saying,
"The Empire" is still the best.

600
01:02:12,632 --> 01:02:15,053
It's the most complex,
the most sophisticated,

601
01:02:15,077 --> 01:02:16,664
wasn't afraid to have a dark ending.

602
01:02:16,688 --> 01:02:18,222
Yeah, but come on. If it
wasn't for the first one

603
01:02:18,246 --> 01:02:19,782
you wouldn't have any of
the rest of the movies.

604
01:02:19,806 --> 01:02:23,381
Well, at least we can all agree
the third one is always the worst.

605
01:02:23,995 --> 01:02:25,663
Hank.
You in here?

606
01:02:25,687 --> 01:02:27,875
I'd like you to meet the...

607
01:02:29,108 --> 01:02:30,314
Moira.

608
01:02:30,338 --> 01:02:31,808
Raven?

609
01:02:32,216 --> 01:02:34,103
I'm sorry, have we met?

610
01:02:35,468 --> 01:02:40,378
Hank, Alex, agent MacTaggert, would
you give us just one moment please?

611
01:02:40,816 --> 01:02:42,392
Of course.

612
01:02:45,588 --> 01:02:47,951
Charles, why didn't she recognize me?
She knew me in this form.

613
01:02:47,975 --> 01:02:50,900
Well. After you left me
on the beach in Cuba,

614
01:02:50,924 --> 01:02:54,062
I took her memories of that time.
Have a sit.

615
01:02:54,086 --> 01:02:55,811
Lucky girl.

616
01:02:57,892 --> 01:03:00,637
It's good to see you, Raven.

617
01:03:00,661 --> 01:03:03,014
- Welcome home.
- This isn't my house.

618
01:03:03,753 --> 01:03:04,858
It was once.

619
01:03:04,882 --> 01:03:07,647
No, it was your home.
I just lived here.

620
01:03:07,671 --> 01:03:09,513
I barely even recognize it now.

621
01:03:09,537 --> 01:03:12,040
Yeah, I have plans for this place.

622
01:03:12,467 --> 01:03:14,415
I mean to turn it
into a real campus.

623
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:19,057
A university. Not just for mutants,
even for humans too.

624
01:03:19,062 --> 01:03:21,244
Living and working,

625
01:03:21,268 --> 01:03:23,214
... growing together.

626
01:03:23,617 --> 01:03:25,670
You know, I really believed that once.

627
01:03:25,694 --> 01:03:28,727
I really believed we can
change them after DC.

628
01:03:28,755 --> 01:03:29,752
We did.

629
01:03:29,776 --> 01:03:31,916
No Charles.
They still hate and fear us.

630
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:34,131
It's just harder to see because
they're more polite about it.

631
01:03:34,155 --> 01:03:35,727
I got sick of living that lie.

632
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:38,642
That's why you're not
in your natural blue form.

633
01:03:38,643 --> 01:03:41,743
I'm not going to be the face
of a world that doesn't exist.

634
01:03:42,322 --> 01:03:44,487
Things are better.
The world is better.

635
01:03:44,511 --> 01:03:46,627
Maybe in Westchester.

636
01:03:46,769 --> 01:03:51,087
Out there, mutants are still running,
hiding, living in fear.

637
01:03:51,111 --> 01:03:54,315
Just because there's not a war
doesn't mean there's peace.

638
01:03:54,316 --> 01:03:56,135
If you want to teach your kids
something, teach them that.

639
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:57,374
Teach them to fight.

640
01:03:57,398 --> 01:03:59,585
Otherwise, they might as well live
in this house for the rest of their lives.

641
01:03:59,609 --> 01:04:04,105
You still sound just like him.
You sound just like Erik.

642
01:04:05,721 --> 01:04:07,480
That's why I'm here.

643
01:04:07,934 --> 01:04:09,785
He's resurfaced.

644
01:04:11,654 --> 01:04:15,348
He had a wife and a daughter.
They were killed.

645
01:04:15,731 --> 01:04:18,248
Along with a handful of policemen.

646
01:04:20,187 --> 01:04:22,296
The whole world
will be looking for him.

647
01:04:22,297 --> 01:04:25,176
But you can help me
find him before they do.

648
01:04:33,561 --> 01:04:36,331
Moira, I'm going to have to
ask you to keep this a secret.

649
01:04:36,355 --> 01:04:39,306
I don't even know
what this... is.

650
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:41,134
It's Cerebro.

651
01:04:41,158 --> 01:04:44,326
- The new model.
- Yeah. I based the color on...

652
01:04:46,278 --> 01:04:47,884
It doesn't matter.

653
01:05:04,301 --> 01:05:05,959
What are those?

654
01:05:05,983 --> 01:05:08,512
Those are all the humans
of the world.

655
01:05:10,130 --> 01:05:11,996
And these...

656
01:05:12,314 --> 01:05:14,464
... are all the mutants.

657
01:05:14,488 --> 01:05:17,511
I'm connected to all of their minds.

658
01:05:18,065 --> 01:05:19,899
The CIA would kill for this.

659
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:21,804
I know they would.

660
01:05:24,008 --> 01:05:25,990
Where are you, Erik?

661
01:05:56,597 --> 01:05:58,273
Charles?

662
01:05:59,105 --> 01:06:01,025
Hello, old friend.

663
01:06:03,450 --> 01:06:05,371
I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

664
01:06:05,395 --> 01:06:07,317
I feel your pain.

665
01:06:08,404 --> 01:06:10,434
And your loss.

666
01:06:11,157 --> 01:06:14,260
You think, because
you can see into my head...

667
01:06:14,284 --> 01:06:16,649
... you know how it feels?

668
01:06:17,121 --> 01:06:19,590
You are looking in the wrong place, Charles.

669
01:06:19,614 --> 01:06:22,611
What happened to them,
it was terribly wrong.

670
01:06:23,951 --> 01:06:27,378
But, come back to us.
I can help you.

671
01:06:27,544 --> 01:06:29,546
Help me?

672
01:06:30,182 --> 01:06:31,691
Think of your wife,
think of your daughter.

673
01:06:31,715 --> 01:06:34,875
- What would they have wanted?
- They would have wanted to live.

674
01:06:35,769 --> 01:06:38,303
I tried your way, Charles.

675
01:06:38,873 --> 01:06:41,178
I tried to be like them.

676
01:06:42,158 --> 01:06:44,252
Live like them.

677
01:06:45,998 --> 01:06:48,938
But it always ends the same way.

678
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:52,938
They took everything away from me.

679
01:06:56,077 --> 01:06:57,759
Now...

680
01:07:00,976 --> 01:07:04,180
We'll take everything from them.

681
01:07:11,162 --> 01:07:12,617
Hank.

682
01:07:14,366 --> 01:07:16,232
He's not alone.

683
01:07:23,207 --> 01:07:25,316
Extraordinary.

684
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:28,204
What do you see?

685
01:07:30,395 --> 01:07:32,574
The answer.

686
01:07:48,582 --> 01:07:50,405
Oh my god.

687
01:07:50,702 --> 01:07:53,698
Thank you for letting me in.

688
01:07:58,171 --> 01:07:59,946
Charles.
Charles, get out!

689
01:07:59,970 --> 01:08:01,279
Charles?

690
01:08:01,821 --> 01:08:05,098
I have never felt
power like this before.

691
01:08:05,345 --> 01:08:07,081
Charles.
Charles, get out!

692
01:08:07,105 --> 01:08:08,816
What's going on?
What's happening?

693
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,418
I think...

694
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,902
Someone's taken over Cerebro.

695
01:08:11,926 --> 01:08:14,264
- They've taken control of it.
- To do what?

696
01:08:15,628 --> 01:08:17,362
To connect.

697
01:08:25,499 --> 01:08:28,285
It's always the same.

698
01:08:28,575 --> 01:08:31,941
And now all this.

699
01:08:34,825 --> 01:08:38,074
No more stones.

700
01:08:39,814 --> 01:08:42,944
Not more spears.

701
01:08:48,862 --> 01:08:52,400
No more slings.

702
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:58,296
No more swords.

703
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:01,716
No more weapons!

704
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:05,269
No more systems!

705
01:09:05,456 --> 01:09:08,059
No more!

706
01:09:08,467 --> 01:09:11,795
No more superpowers.

707
01:09:12,603 --> 01:09:14,277
Charles!

708
01:09:16,901 --> 01:09:18,312
Hank!

709
01:09:35,113 --> 01:09:37,091
What the hell is going on?

710
01:09:37,115 --> 01:09:39,398
Who's turning the keys?

711
01:09:39,596 --> 01:09:41,057
The men are.

712
01:09:41,081 --> 01:09:42,506
Who agreed with the launch?

713
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:44,556
Hank, do something!

714
01:09:49,043 --> 01:09:50,957
It won't shut down!

715
01:09:52,931 --> 01:09:55,617
We've lost contact with the
Trident and Polaris subs.

716
01:09:55,618 --> 01:09:57,458
The Air Force is reporting
the same thing.

717
01:09:57,482 --> 01:10:01,118
So much faith in their... tools

718
01:10:01,142 --> 01:10:03,717
and their... machines.

719
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:07,956
Russia, China, England,
Israel, India.

720
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:10,029
Everybody's got nukes in the air.

721
01:10:10,053 --> 01:10:12,139
What's the target?
Where are they going?

722
01:10:12,163 --> 01:10:14,114
Up.
Straight up.

723
01:10:14,137 --> 01:10:15,544
- Alex.
- What?

724
01:10:15,569 --> 01:10:16,647
Destroy it!

725
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:19,612
Destroy everything.
Destroy Cerebro!

726
01:10:23,148 --> 01:10:24,989
Wreak havoc.

727
01:10:28,672 --> 01:10:33,566
You can fire your arrows
from the Tower of Babel.

728
01:10:41,967 --> 01:10:47,961
BUT YOU CAN NEVER STRIKE GOD!

729
01:11:03,146 --> 01:11:05,486
Charles.
Charles, are you okay?

730
01:11:22,468 --> 01:11:24,132
Erik.

731
01:11:26,835 --> 01:11:28,484
Charles!

732
01:11:29,249 --> 01:11:30,770
Alex!

733
01:11:31,084 --> 01:11:32,899
Hey!
Hey, asshole!

734
01:11:32,923 --> 01:11:35,314
All will be revealed, my child.

735
01:11:35,338 --> 01:11:36,514
Stop!

736
01:11:36,538 --> 01:11:37,951
NO!

737
01:14:26,578 --> 01:14:28,055
Wow!

738
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:33,894
Where...
Where did you...?

739
01:14:33,895 --> 01:14:36,506
I was looking for the Professor.
I thought he lived here.

740
01:14:39,845 --> 01:14:41,617
They took him away.

741
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:44,380
She's the one.
That's her.

742
01:14:44,404 --> 01:14:46,029
Are you sure?

743
01:14:46,452 --> 01:14:48,380
Is she going to help us?

744
01:14:57,015 --> 01:14:58,786
They look up to you.

745
01:15:02,774 --> 01:15:04,213
Right now.

746
01:15:04,453 --> 01:15:06,007
They need you.

747
01:15:08,975 --> 01:15:10,972
That's not what they need.

748
01:15:12,143 --> 01:15:14,110
Whoa!
That's far out.

749
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:24,487
What happened?
Where's Alex?

750
01:15:24,511 --> 01:15:25,924
Where's my brother?

751
01:15:25,948 --> 01:15:28,143
I'm pretty sure I got everybody.

752
01:15:30,141 --> 01:15:32,691
Alex was closest to the blast.

753
01:15:47,836 --> 01:15:49,263
Alex.

754
01:16:09,954 --> 01:16:11,824
We're 1 click out.

755
01:16:12,009 --> 01:16:14,130
Alright, boys.
This is it.

756
01:16:15,864 --> 01:16:17,069
Please remain calm.

757
01:16:17,093 --> 01:16:18,157
Scott.

758
01:16:18,158 --> 01:16:21,253
Medical assistance is on the way.

759
01:16:22,229 --> 01:16:24,375
Please remain calm.

760
01:16:24,399 --> 01:16:27,585
Medical assistance is on the way.

761
01:16:28,214 --> 01:16:30,363
Please remain calm.

762
01:16:30,387 --> 01:16:33,475
Medical assistance is on the way.

763
01:16:34,562 --> 01:16:36,730
Please remain calm.

764
01:16:36,754 --> 01:16:39,954
Medical assistance is on the way.

765
01:16:41,671 --> 01:16:42,654
Hey!

766
01:16:42,678 --> 01:16:46,622
Moira MacTaggert, CIA!
Thank God you're here!

767
01:16:51,533 --> 01:16:53,080
WAIT !

768
01:16:53,104 --> 01:16:54,632
Fire!

769
01:16:59,585 --> 01:17:01,219
I want her!

770
01:17:02,987 --> 01:17:04,235
Him!

771
01:17:05,227 --> 01:17:06,475
Him!

772
01:17:13,226 --> 01:17:15,672
- And her!
- Yes, sir.

773
01:17:19,226 --> 01:17:21,136
Leave the kids.

774
01:17:27,073 --> 01:17:29,326
- What do we do?
- Keep quiet.

775
01:17:30,026 --> 01:17:33,043
X-Ray 7, I'm doing a
final sweep on the ground.

776
01:17:40,139 --> 01:17:42,069
Alright, you!
Are you clear?

777
01:17:42,093 --> 01:17:43,541
Clear!

778
01:17:44,808 --> 01:17:46,912
Pack them up.
Let's go.

779
01:17:47,498 --> 01:17:48,865
Come on, let's move!

780
01:17:48,889 --> 01:17:50,409
Thanks, Jean.

781
01:17:50,827 --> 01:17:51,998
We got to help them.

782
01:17:52,022 --> 01:17:54,463
- Kurt, can you get us in that thing?
- You want to get in there?

783
01:17:54,494 --> 01:17:55,660
What if the soldiers see us?

784
01:17:55,684 --> 01:17:58,196
Don't worry.
They won't see us, trust me.

785
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:01,566
Hold on.

786
01:18:16,176 --> 01:18:18,134
Kurt, get us all out of here!

787
01:18:19,932 --> 01:18:20,930
I can't!

788
01:18:20,954 --> 01:18:24,482
When they closed the doors,
there's some kind of electric field.

789
01:18:24,506 --> 01:18:26,576
- It's like Berlin all over.
- Jean, get into the pilots heads.

790
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:27,999
- Don't let them take off!
- I can't.

791
01:18:28,023 --> 01:18:31,102
I can't reach the pilots.
I can't reach anyone.

792
01:18:37,895 --> 01:18:39,947
We're also getting reports
from Europe and Asia.

793
01:18:39,971 --> 01:18:42,109
This was not just
the US phenomenon.

794
01:18:42,133 --> 01:18:45,841
It seems the entire world has been
disarmed of nuclear weapons.

795
01:18:45,842 --> 01:18:48,553
The Pentagon has confirmed
multiple launches from Russia,

796
01:18:48,577 --> 01:18:50,536
as well as the UK,
Israel and China.

797
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:51,625
- Look!
- Up there.

798
01:18:51,626 --> 01:18:53,518
So far, there has been
no response from the White House.

799
01:18:53,542 --> 01:18:57,292
Eye witness accounts have been pouring in
from across the globe.

800
01:18:57,316 --> 01:19:02,014
Authorities are not sure if it was
an act of peace or an act of war.

801
01:19:07,773 --> 01:19:09,428
Dear Father.

802
01:19:10,113 --> 01:19:12,790
Hold me in the light of God.

803
01:19:16,538 --> 01:19:18,523
It should have been me.

804
01:19:19,419 --> 01:19:22,857
He was the one who's going to
do something with his life.

805
01:19:22,881 --> 01:19:24,911
He was always the one.

806
01:19:25,998 --> 01:19:28,403
That's not how he felt.

807
01:19:28,558 --> 01:19:32,761
He felt you were the one who's going to
do something special with your life.

808
01:19:33,149 --> 01:19:36,138
That you're going to make
a difference in the world.

809
01:19:37,334 --> 01:19:39,469
Maybe even change it.

810
01:19:39,977 --> 01:19:42,015
How did you know what he felt?

811
01:19:43,071 --> 01:19:45,567
I know what everybody feels.

812
01:19:59,983 --> 01:20:02,773
Hold me in the light of God.

813
01:20:03,265 --> 01:20:05,950
Protect me from danger.

814
01:20:06,412 --> 01:20:09,118
Save me by your command.

815
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:12,213
Listen to my prayer.

816
01:20:12,829 --> 01:20:15,284
And keep me safe.

817
01:20:48,332 --> 01:20:51,375
You're blocking me.
How?

818
01:20:51,399 --> 01:20:53,724
I can shield their minds
from your power.

819
01:20:53,748 --> 01:20:57,471
It's one of the many gifts I have
acquired through out the millennia.

820
01:20:57,495 --> 01:21:02,330
But to... see...
inside a mind.

821
01:21:02,354 --> 01:21:04,366
To control it.

822
01:21:05,178 --> 01:21:07,328
That's your gift.

823
01:21:08,297 --> 01:21:10,227
You saw it, didn't you?

824
01:21:10,251 --> 01:21:12,729
The glory of what's to come.

825
01:21:13,517 --> 01:21:16,008
Are you going to take part
in all this killing?

826
01:21:16,757 --> 01:21:18,462
Destruction?

827
01:21:19,008 --> 01:21:21,992
- It's all I ever known.
- No, it isn't.

828
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:25,945
- You've just forgotten.
- No, Charles, I remember.

829
01:21:27,493 --> 01:21:29,358
Your way doesn't work.

830
01:21:29,381 --> 01:21:33,197
I showed him a better way.
A better world.

831
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:37,018
No, you just tapped into his rage and pain.
That's all you've done.

832
01:21:37,152 --> 01:21:39,079
I told you from the moment I met you,

833
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:43,137
there's more to you, Erik.
There is good in you too.

834
01:21:43,161 --> 01:21:46,506
Whatever it is you think
you saw in me, Charles.

835
01:21:48,231 --> 01:21:49,920
I buried it.

836
01:21:49,944 --> 01:21:51,845
With my family.

837
01:22:03,909 --> 01:22:05,021
- What?
- What?

838
01:22:05,045 --> 01:22:06,634
What's wrong with you?

839
01:22:06,658 --> 01:22:08,875
Is that going to
happen to all of us?

840
01:22:09,746 --> 01:22:12,631
No, I just left my meds
in the house.

841
01:22:12,655 --> 01:22:14,129
- What happened? Where we are?
- Hey.

842
01:22:14,153 --> 01:22:15,385
Hey!

843
01:22:15,409 --> 01:22:17,960
- Hello, Mystique.
- Major Stryker.

844
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:19,140
Colonel Stryker.

845
01:22:19,164 --> 01:22:20,929
I wouldn't get too close
to the wall if I were you.

846
01:22:20,953 --> 01:22:23,071
It may create some... discomfort.

847
01:22:23,095 --> 01:22:26,264
I'm Moira MacTaggert.
I'm a senior officer at the CIA.

848
01:22:26,288 --> 01:22:27,939
I know who you are,
agent MacTaggert.

849
01:22:27,963 --> 01:22:31,281
- You cannot keep me here in this...
- Actually, I can.

850
01:22:31,305 --> 01:22:35,192
A psychic event just destroyed
every nuke from here to Moscow.

851
01:22:35,216 --> 01:22:38,291
That event emanated from
exactly where we found you.

852
01:22:38,315 --> 01:22:41,054
At the home of the world's
most powerful psychic.

853
01:22:41,085 --> 01:22:45,138
So, you're going to tell me.
Where is Charles Xavier?

854
01:22:45,162 --> 01:22:47,647
It's not him
you should be worried about.

855
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:51,251
There's someone else.
Someone more powerful.

856
01:22:51,275 --> 01:22:54,239
If you let us out of here,
we can help you.

857
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:57,948
Do you really expect me
to believe that?

858
01:22:57,972 --> 01:22:59,518
You can put on any face
that you want,

859
01:22:59,542 --> 01:23:02,600
but I know who you are.
What you are.

860
01:23:07,247 --> 01:23:09,253
Hey, Moira.
Mm.

861
01:23:09,277 --> 01:23:13,532
What did you mean when you said
someone more powerful than Charles?

862
01:23:14,727 --> 01:23:17,106
Once he finished this,
we'll go from there.

863
01:23:23,079 --> 01:23:24,623
What's taking so long?

864
01:23:24,647 --> 01:23:25,796
I can't get in.

865
01:23:25,820 --> 01:23:28,469
It has a field around it
like the helicopter.

866
01:23:28,493 --> 01:23:30,568
There's got to be a way
to cut the power.

867
01:23:30,591 --> 01:23:35,950
Charles, you will send a message
to every living mind.

868
01:23:35,974 --> 01:23:39,463
You will tell them that this Earth
will be laid waste.

869
01:23:39,487 --> 01:23:44,216
That it is I, En Sabah Nur,
who wreak this upon them.

870
01:23:49,296 --> 01:23:50,864
Now.

871
01:23:51,162 --> 01:23:54,350
Deliver my message.

872
01:23:54,374 --> 01:23:56,148
Even if I wanted to,

873
01:23:56,172 --> 01:23:59,710
I couldn't reach that many people.
I don't have Cerebro.

874
01:24:01,631 --> 01:24:06,236
You don't need a machine...
to amplify your powers.

875
01:24:06,791 --> 01:24:08,657
You have me.

876
01:24:21,192 --> 01:24:24,336
Guys, that could be
our way out of here.

877
01:24:27,741 --> 01:24:30,426
You know him?
Magneto.

878
01:24:31,132 --> 01:24:32,794
I used to.

879
01:24:33,341 --> 01:24:34,913
I'm not so sure anymore.

880
01:24:34,937 --> 01:24:36,321
What was he like?

881
01:24:36,345 --> 01:24:40,601
Was he... like they say he was?
Was he a...

882
01:24:41,108 --> 01:24:42,526
... bad guy?

883
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:43,894
No.

884
01:24:44,593 --> 01:24:48,361
I mean, yeah.
He was...

885
01:24:49,619 --> 01:24:52,653
Why do you care so much? Did you
see his speech on TV or something?

886
01:24:52,677 --> 01:24:55,158
Yeah, but...

887
01:24:58,987 --> 01:25:00,465
He's my father.

888
01:25:00,489 --> 01:25:01,694
What?

889
01:25:01,718 --> 01:25:03,386
- He and my mom, they...
- Yeah, I know.

890
01:25:03,410 --> 01:25:05,136
But...
Are you sure?

891
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:08,519
Yeah. Yeah. yeah.
He left my mom before I was born.

892
01:25:08,543 --> 01:25:11,399
I met him 10 years back,
but I didn't know it was him.

893
01:25:11,423 --> 01:25:14,140
By the time I figured it out,
it was too late, you know.

894
01:25:14,164 --> 01:25:15,855
Then, this week I saw him
on TV again.

895
01:25:15,879 --> 01:25:18,746
And, I came to their house
looking for him.

896
01:25:18,770 --> 01:25:21,363
But, by the time I got there...

897
01:25:23,274 --> 01:25:24,939
Late again.

898
01:25:26,964 --> 01:25:28,578
You know, for a guy
who moves as fast as me,

899
01:25:28,602 --> 01:25:31,030
I always seem to be too late.

900
01:25:31,791 --> 01:25:33,971
Let's hope not this time.

901
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:36,659
Yeah.
Seriously.

902
01:25:36,683 --> 01:25:40,304
Hear me,
inhabitants of this world.

903
01:25:40,328 --> 01:25:42,434
- What is this?
- This is a message.

904
01:25:42,435 --> 01:25:43,789
I think it's the Professor.

905
01:25:43,790 --> 01:25:48,005
A message to every man,
woman and mutant.

906
01:25:48,029 --> 01:25:51,498
You have lost your way.

907
01:25:51,522 --> 01:25:53,889
You have lost your way.

908
01:25:53,913 --> 01:25:56,199
But I have returned.

909
01:25:56,223 --> 01:25:59,524
But I have returned.

910
01:25:59,548 --> 01:26:03,046
The day of reckoning,
it is here.

911
01:26:03,547 --> 01:26:05,519
All your buildings...

912
01:26:05,635 --> 01:26:09,633
All your buildings and temples...

913
01:26:09,657 --> 01:26:11,315
... will fall.

914
01:26:11,339 --> 01:26:16,686
The dawn of a new era will emerge.

915
01:26:16,710 --> 01:26:19,152
For there is nothing you can do...

916
01:26:19,153 --> 01:26:21,362
- Jean.
- ... to stop what is coming.

917
01:26:21,386 --> 01:26:25,074
Jean, if you can hear me,
focus on my voice.

918
01:26:25,074 --> 01:26:27,088
Cairo.
Find us.

919
01:26:27,112 --> 01:26:29,497
Jean, find us.
Cairo. Find us.

920
01:26:29,521 --> 01:26:32,611
Jean.
This message is for one reason alone.

921
01:26:32,634 --> 01:26:35,300
To tell the strongest among you...

922
01:26:35,324 --> 01:26:38,850
Those with the greatest power.

923
01:26:38,874 --> 01:26:42,396
This earth will be yours.

924
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:45,265
Those with the greatest power.

925
01:26:48,194 --> 01:26:50,638
Protect those without.

926
01:26:52,919 --> 01:26:55,468
That's my message to the world.

927
01:26:59,745 --> 01:27:02,114
That was Charles doing that
without Cerebro.

928
01:27:02,138 --> 01:27:04,612
Sir, what was that voice?

929
01:27:05,022 --> 01:27:06,165
I know that voice.

930
01:27:06,189 --> 01:27:07,736
It's Xavier, isn't it?
What's going on?

931
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:10,286
- We don't know!
- We don't know, bro!

932
01:27:10,603 --> 01:27:11,924
He just spoke to me.

933
01:27:11,948 --> 01:27:14,230
- I think he spoke to everyone.
- I can hear him too.

934
01:27:14,254 --> 01:27:16,900
No, no. He just sent
me a hidden message.

935
01:27:16,993 --> 01:27:19,049
One he knew only I would hear.

936
01:27:19,073 --> 01:27:20,779
I know where they are.

937
01:27:21,265 --> 01:27:22,512
Hey!

938
01:27:23,842 --> 01:27:26,208
Shots fired!
Where's it coming from?

939
01:27:27,005 --> 01:27:29,258
I have intruders in quad 6.

940
01:27:30,441 --> 01:27:32,822
Send a security team
and take them out.

941
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:42,365
The generator.
It's worth a shot.

942
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:43,957
Kurt?

943
01:28:04,524 --> 01:28:06,672
There's some kind of animal in there.

944
01:28:09,931 --> 01:28:11,774
It's no animal.

945
01:28:13,009 --> 01:28:14,553
It's a man.

946
01:28:14,577 --> 01:28:16,136
Who is he?

947
01:28:16,874 --> 01:28:19,711
A part of himself
has been taken away.

948
01:28:19,939 --> 01:28:21,121
What do you mean?

949
01:28:21,145 --> 01:28:23,956
I mean, they turned him into...

950
01:28:23,980 --> 01:28:25,898
... some kind of weapon.

951
01:28:30,085 --> 01:28:33,332
Charlie 3, report.
Did you find them?

952
01:28:43,578 --> 01:28:45,064
Turn it down.

953
01:29:07,367 --> 01:29:08,703
Fire!

954
01:29:18,565 --> 01:29:21,003
Weapon X is loose.
I repeat.

955
01:29:21,027 --> 01:29:23,630
Weapon X is loose.

956
01:29:25,270 --> 01:29:27,338
You sure he's not an animal?

957
01:29:31,767 --> 01:29:34,724
- He's in the central halls.
- Engaging target, Sector 5.

958
01:29:35,608 --> 01:29:37,173
We can't stop h... !

959
01:29:51,804 --> 01:29:53,052
Hey!

960
01:30:12,501 --> 01:30:14,288
- What are they doing?
- What's going on?

961
01:30:14,312 --> 01:30:15,326
I just lost the feed.

962
01:30:15,350 --> 01:30:17,635
- What's going on here?
- Hey!

963
01:30:18,281 --> 01:30:19,954
I'll be right back.

964
01:30:22,486 --> 01:30:24,036
Move!

965
01:30:39,669 --> 01:30:42,192
Hey!
Stay where you are!

966
01:31:00,646 --> 01:31:02,289
Scott, wait.

967
01:31:04,096 --> 01:31:06,319
I can help you.

968
01:31:11,248 --> 01:31:12,688
Jean.

969
01:31:49,519 --> 01:31:51,934
Logan.
Logan.

970
01:32:37,484 --> 01:32:39,146
What did you do to him?

971
01:32:40,330 --> 01:32:43,277
I found a piece of his past
and gave it back to him.

972
01:32:44,032 --> 01:32:46,536
Just a few memories I could reach.

973
01:32:48,186 --> 01:32:50,763
I hope that's the last
we'd seen of that guy.

974
01:33:08,846 --> 01:33:10,297
Kurt.

975
01:33:12,442 --> 01:33:13,952
- What?
- What?

976
01:33:13,976 --> 01:33:15,279
Hey.

977
01:33:19,641 --> 01:33:22,162
Stay away from the...

978
01:33:22,163 --> 01:33:23,411
The what?

979
01:33:23,435 --> 01:33:25,733
Th... door...
Stay away from the...

980
01:33:25,757 --> 01:33:27,199
- Get away from the door!
- The door! The door!

981
01:33:27,223 --> 01:33:29,413
On three.
One.

982
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:30,685
Two.

983
01:33:42,969 --> 01:33:44,418
We know where the Professor is.

984
01:33:44,442 --> 01:33:45,965
I think we might have
a way out of here.

985
01:33:45,989 --> 01:33:47,268
Well, you've been busy.

986
01:33:47,298 --> 01:33:49,764
We had a... a little help.

987
01:33:49,823 --> 01:33:51,293
Let's go.

988
01:33:53,103 --> 01:33:54,785
- Watch out!
- Jesus!

989
01:33:54,809 --> 01:33:56,131
Oh, sorry.

990
01:33:56,155 --> 01:33:57,634
This way.

991
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:08,812
This was meant to be
the center of the universe

992
01:34:08,836 --> 01:34:10,539
before I was betrayed.

993
01:34:10,563 --> 01:34:14,316
Now.
It will be.

994
01:35:30,836 --> 01:35:32,509
Nice.

995
01:35:32,533 --> 01:35:35,050
Hey, Hank. Do you think
you can fly this thing?

996
01:35:36,133 --> 01:35:38,077
Yeah, I can figure it out.

997
01:35:39,223 --> 01:35:40,917
Hey, guys.

998
01:35:41,199 --> 01:35:43,029
Flight suits.

999
01:35:46,556 --> 01:35:48,427
You got your warplane.

1000
01:35:48,451 --> 01:35:50,277
Let's go to war.

1001
01:35:56,778 --> 01:35:58,649
A gift...

1002
01:35:58,673 --> 01:36:01,444
From the past you left behind.

1003
01:36:01,468 --> 01:36:04,928
And the future that lies ahead.

1004
01:36:05,546 --> 01:36:09,019
You, will reach down, my son,

1005
01:36:09,049 --> 01:36:11,232
deep into the Earth.

1006
01:36:11,256 --> 01:36:14,503
Rip everything they built
from the ground.

1007
01:36:14,527 --> 01:36:17,274
Wipe clean this world.

1008
01:36:17,298 --> 01:36:20,797
And we will lead those that survived.

1009
01:36:20,820 --> 01:36:23,836
Tinge to a better one.

1010
01:36:23,861 --> 01:36:25,318
And me?

1011
01:36:26,567 --> 01:36:29,689
Am I to play a role
in this madness?

1012
01:36:30,517 --> 01:36:34,218
You have the most
important role of all.

1013
01:36:44,956 --> 01:36:46,750
Were you scared?

1014
01:36:47,171 --> 01:36:49,199
That day in DC,
were you scared?

1015
01:36:49,223 --> 01:36:50,513
No.

1016
01:36:55,866 --> 01:36:58,131
But I was scared
on my first mission.

1017
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,212
I was on a plane like this
with my friends.

1018
01:37:01,236 --> 01:37:03,070
About your age.

1019
01:37:06,061 --> 01:37:08,478
We called ourselves the X-Men.

1020
01:37:09,634 --> 01:37:11,529
Your brother was there.

1021
01:37:11,553 --> 01:37:13,385
We used to call Havoc.

1022
01:37:13,409 --> 01:37:15,693
He was a real handful, but...

1023
01:37:17,036 --> 01:37:19,887
When it came down to it,
he was very brave.

1024
01:37:21,843 --> 01:37:24,517
What happened to the rest
of the kids that went with you?

1025
01:37:24,541 --> 01:37:26,082
The X-Men.

1026
01:37:28,359 --> 01:37:30,661
Hank and I are
the only ones left.

1027
01:37:31,159 --> 01:37:33,406
I couldn't save the rest of them.

1028
01:37:33,834 --> 01:37:35,905
I told you, I'm not a hero.

1029
01:37:36,335 --> 01:37:38,601
Well, you're a hero to us.

1030
01:37:38,625 --> 01:37:42,437
Seeing you that day on TV
changed my life.

1031
01:37:42,461 --> 01:37:43,962
My too.

1032
01:37:43,986 --> 01:37:45,504
My too.

1033
01:37:47,096 --> 01:37:50,214
I mean, I still live in
my mom's basement, but...

1034
01:37:50,238 --> 01:37:52,134
Everything else is...

1035
01:37:54,017 --> 01:37:56,067
Well, it's pretty much the same.

1036
01:37:57,473 --> 01:37:59,404
I'm a total loser.

1037
01:38:56,475 --> 01:38:58,668
What we're seeing is a
magnetic phenomenon

1038
01:38:58,692 --> 01:39:01,550
on a much larger scale
than we saw in Auschwitz.

1039
01:39:01,574 --> 01:39:05,774
The ground is full of magnetic elements.
Iron, nickel, cobalt.

1040
01:39:05,798 --> 01:39:08,152
The ocean's floor is
lying with them too.

1041
01:39:08,176 --> 01:39:11,051
It's already begun,
at the lowest depths.

1042
01:39:11,075 --> 01:39:14,140
Land masses will slow it,
but not for long.

1043
01:39:14,140 --> 01:39:16,810
Eventually, cities, urban centers.

1044
01:39:16,834 --> 01:39:20,786
Anything built since the
Bronze Age will be wiped away.

1045
01:39:20,810 --> 01:39:22,521
The death toll will be billions.

1046
01:39:22,545 --> 01:39:25,602
He's talking about the
whole god damn world.

1047
01:40:11,642 --> 01:40:13,954
You're just another false god.

1048
01:40:13,978 --> 01:40:16,425
And whoever's left to follow you
when this is all over.

1049
01:40:16,449 --> 01:40:19,555
They will betray you again.

1050
01:40:21,464 --> 01:40:23,578
You're wrong, Charles.

1051
01:40:23,602 --> 01:40:27,046
For the first time in a thousand lifetimes...

1052
01:40:27,070 --> 01:40:29,292
I have you.

1053
01:40:29,316 --> 01:40:34,802
For all my gifts, I've yet to
possess the one I needed most.

1054
01:40:35,222 --> 01:40:39,342
To be... everywhere.

1055
01:40:41,828 --> 01:40:46,112
To be... everyone.

1056
01:41:00,058 --> 01:41:02,296
Seventh wonder, 12 o'clock.

1057
01:41:09,854 --> 01:41:12,724
He has the Professor in the
center of the pyramid.

1058
01:41:13,101 --> 01:41:16,470
He's going to transfer his
consciousness into the Professor.

1059
01:41:16,494 --> 01:41:21,180
If he does that, he'll have the power
to control every mind in the world.

1060
01:41:27,339 --> 01:41:29,911
What the hell is that?

1061
01:41:30,501 --> 01:41:32,070
It's Erik.

1062
01:41:40,805 --> 01:41:43,641
You guys help Nightcrawler
get into the pyramid.

1063
01:41:44,690 --> 01:41:46,744
Get Charles.
I'll take care of Erik.

1064
01:41:46,768 --> 01:41:48,775
How are you going to
get through that?

1065
01:41:49,523 --> 01:41:51,470
I can get you in there.

1066
01:41:51,494 --> 01:41:53,725
I came here for him.
Let me help you.

1067
01:41:54,278 --> 01:41:56,813
The rest of you, get Charles on
this plane and get him out of here.

1068
01:41:56,837 --> 01:41:59,411
- We're not leaving without you!
- Don't worry.

1069
01:41:59,435 --> 01:42:00,640
We'll catch up.

1070
01:42:00,664 --> 01:42:02,077
Hold on.

1071
01:42:30,889 --> 01:42:32,147
Hank, you go with the kids.

1072
01:42:32,171 --> 01:42:34,411
- Moira will be waiting on the plane.
- Wait.

1073
01:42:34,770 --> 01:42:35,915
What?

1074
01:42:35,916 --> 01:42:38,751
Not all of us can fully
control our powers.

1075
01:42:38,775 --> 01:42:40,360
Then, don't.

1076
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:42,542
You need to embrace them.

1077
01:42:45,085 --> 01:42:46,720
We all do.

1078
01:43:09,237 --> 01:43:12,033
Go, join the others.

1079
01:43:12,057 --> 01:43:15,783
Protect me until the
transference is complete.

1080
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:41,167
There's an entrance.
It's clear.

1081
01:43:44,905 --> 01:43:47,120
Kurt.
Get in there!

1082
01:43:56,752 --> 01:43:58,603
In the pyramid.
Move!

1083
01:43:58,919 --> 01:44:00,211
Go!

1084
01:44:35,070 --> 01:44:36,739
Split them up.

1085
01:44:58,774 --> 01:45:00,359
Professor.

1086
01:45:03,444 --> 01:45:04,757
Kurt, you have to hurry!

1087
01:45:04,781 --> 01:45:07,674
I'm trying.
It's like a maze in here.

1088
01:45:16,839 --> 01:45:18,312
Kurt, no!

1089
01:45:42,176 --> 01:45:45,046
The magnetic field is too strong,
I can't get us in there.

1090
01:45:46,821 --> 01:45:48,527
Erik!

1091
01:45:54,743 --> 01:45:56,442
Mystique.

1092
01:45:59,946 --> 01:46:02,596
I know you think
you've lost everything.

1093
01:46:03,543 --> 01:46:05,339
But, you haven't.

1094
01:46:06,474 --> 01:46:08,223
You have me.

1095
01:46:08,699 --> 01:46:10,724
You have Charles.

1096
01:46:16,165 --> 01:46:18,788
You have more family than you know.

1097
01:46:19,750 --> 01:46:23,010
You never had the chance
to save your family before.

1098
01:46:23,568 --> 01:46:25,678
But you do now.

1099
01:46:27,780 --> 01:46:30,103
That's what I've come here
to tell you.

1100
01:46:35,378 --> 01:46:36,870
And you?

1101
01:46:45,423 --> 01:46:46,717
I'm your...

1102
01:46:51,094 --> 01:46:53,519
I'm here for my family too.

1103
01:47:40,774 --> 01:47:42,590
Get out!
Get out!

1104
01:47:42,614 --> 01:47:44,558
GET OUT !!!

1105
01:47:50,399 --> 01:47:52,006
Arrivederci.

1106
01:48:02,864 --> 01:48:04,574
We're losing him.

1107
01:48:19,703 --> 01:48:21,377
I'll be right back.

1108
01:48:31,498 --> 01:48:33,580
Scott, glasses on!

1109
01:48:42,394 --> 01:48:43,834
Let's go!

1110
01:48:59,428 --> 01:49:01,477
- Lock on.
- Here we go.

1111
01:49:17,796 --> 01:49:19,349
Psylocke!

1112
01:49:34,598 --> 01:49:36,468
What the hell was that?

1113
01:49:42,386 --> 01:49:43,562
Kurt.

1114
01:49:43,586 --> 01:49:45,076
Everyone grab hold of Nightcrawler!

1115
01:49:45,100 --> 01:49:46,475
I've never done it
with this many people.

1116
01:49:46,499 --> 01:49:48,269
Get us out of here.

1117
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:04,427
Kurt, hurry!

1118
01:50:05,372 --> 01:50:06,657
Kurt!

1119
01:50:31,218 --> 01:50:32,832
Charles.

1120
01:50:38,049 --> 01:50:39,159
Is he okay?

1121
01:50:39,160 --> 01:50:41,317
It's his energy.
He's drained.

1122
01:50:41,385 --> 01:50:43,768
No.
Get out.

1123
01:50:43,792 --> 01:50:45,645
Get...
Get out!

1124
01:50:45,669 --> 01:50:48,725
Professor. Professor, it's okay.
You're with us.

1125
01:50:49,041 --> 01:50:50,660
It's okay.

1126
01:50:58,727 --> 01:51:01,460
I'm going to go fight
for what I have left.

1127
01:51:04,545 --> 01:51:06,161
Are you?

1128
01:51:18,617 --> 01:51:21,155
There's so much more than you
than you know.

1129
01:51:21,179 --> 01:51:23,968
Not just pain and anger.

1130
01:51:24,232 --> 01:51:26,504
There's good too.
I felt it.

1131
01:51:26,528 --> 01:51:28,549
It's not just me
you're walking away from.

1132
01:51:28,573 --> 01:51:32,537
Here you have the chance to be part
of something much bigger than yourself.

1133
01:51:32,890 --> 01:51:35,272
And it needs you, Erik.

1134
01:52:03,038 --> 01:52:05,085
Useless.

1135
01:52:10,212 --> 01:52:12,254
Charles.

1136
01:52:13,501 --> 01:52:16,047
I know you can hear me.

1137
01:52:16,564 --> 01:52:20,269
We're still connected.

1138
01:52:22,952 --> 01:52:24,664
Charles!

1139
01:52:25,030 --> 01:52:27,181
Show yourself!

1140
01:52:27,327 --> 01:52:29,943
CHARLES!

1141
01:52:30,038 --> 01:52:32,614
SHOW YOURSELF!

1142
01:53:00,590 --> 01:53:03,122
Foolish child.

1143
01:53:10,843 --> 01:53:12,236
Peter.

1144
01:53:28,342 --> 01:53:29,943
End him.

1145
01:53:50,945 --> 01:53:54,380
(Greater fighter. She's my hero.
I want to be like her... )

1146
01:53:55,031 --> 01:53:56,606
Raven.

1147
01:54:03,489 --> 01:54:05,836
The great hero.

1148
01:54:10,095 --> 01:54:12,052
- I'm going out there.
- I'm going with you.

1149
01:54:12,053 --> 01:54:13,493
No.

1150
01:54:14,155 --> 01:54:17,317
- It's me he wants.
- Charles, you can't give yourself up.

1151
01:54:17,341 --> 01:54:20,861
If he has you, he has us all.
The whole world.

1152
01:54:20,885 --> 01:54:24,607
You are feeble.
Just like the others.

1153
01:54:24,631 --> 01:54:26,319
Charles!

1154
01:54:26,343 --> 01:54:29,613
Come!
Rescue your weakling!

1155
01:54:29,637 --> 01:54:32,852
Give your life,
for their's!

1156
01:54:33,682 --> 01:54:35,122
No.

1157
01:54:42,620 --> 01:54:44,139
He was right.

1158
01:54:44,807 --> 01:54:47,752
There is still some part
of me connected to him.

1159
01:54:47,776 --> 01:54:48,883
Charles!

1160
01:54:48,907 --> 01:54:50,248
I can get inside his head.

1161
01:54:50,272 --> 01:54:52,648
Will you do nothing?

1162
01:54:53,567 --> 01:54:55,966
Thank you for letting me in.

1163
01:55:12,639 --> 01:55:14,521
You want what I have?

1164
01:55:14,545 --> 01:55:17,007
You want to feel what I feel?

1165
01:55:27,859 --> 01:55:29,820
Welcome to my world!

1166
01:55:31,144 --> 01:55:33,314
You're in my house now!

1167
01:55:42,477 --> 01:55:44,980
You'll need a bigger house.

1168
01:57:00,681 --> 01:57:02,427
You betray me.

1169
01:57:02,451 --> 01:57:03,891
No.

1170
01:57:04,196 --> 01:57:06,155
I betrayed them.

1171
01:57:32,717 --> 01:57:33,938
Let's jump.

1172
01:57:33,939 --> 01:57:35,379
What?

1173
01:57:39,908 --> 01:57:41,348
Cover me.

1174
01:57:43,261 --> 01:57:44,701
I got you.

1175
01:57:49,647 --> 01:57:51,087
Come on!

1176
01:58:11,302 --> 01:58:13,972
You lack strength, Charles.

1177
01:58:19,793 --> 01:58:21,263
Jean.

1178
01:58:26,299 --> 01:58:27,927
Come here.

1179
01:58:39,448 --> 01:58:40,940
Help...

1180
01:58:43,153 --> 01:58:44,467
Me.

1181
01:58:49,157 --> 01:58:50,605
Stay here.

1182
01:58:59,374 --> 01:59:01,276
You can't stop him.

1183
01:59:01,627 --> 01:59:03,131
Jean.

1184
01:59:04,856 --> 01:59:07,572
Help me!

1185
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:30,752
Hank!

1186
01:59:31,575 --> 01:59:33,098
Hank!

1187
01:59:39,284 --> 01:59:42,213
It's over, Charles.
You're finished.

1188
01:59:42,237 --> 01:59:44,556
You're mine now.

1189
01:59:46,216 --> 01:59:49,149
You will never win.

1190
01:59:49,173 --> 01:59:51,377
And why is that?

1191
01:59:51,401 --> 01:59:53,404
Because you are alone.

1192
01:59:55,143 --> 01:59:58,734
And I am not!

1193
02:00:09,992 --> 02:00:11,608
Let ...

1194
02:00:11,632 --> 02:00:13,278
go.

1195
02:00:13,302 --> 02:00:15,976
Unleash your power, Jean.

1196
02:00:16,548 --> 02:00:18,501
No fear.

1197
02:01:03,598 --> 02:01:06,375
Unleash your power!

1198
02:01:06,399 --> 02:01:08,605
Let go, Jean!

1199
02:01:08,629 --> 02:01:11,290
Jean, let go!

1200
02:01:44,625 --> 02:01:46,517
He's getting away.

1201
02:02:03,033 --> 02:02:06,682
All is revealed.

1202
02:03:05,877 --> 02:03:08,000
Charles! Charles!

1203
02:03:08,779 --> 02:03:09,975
- We've lost him!
- Charles.

1204
02:03:09,999 --> 02:03:11,867
- He's gone.
- No, Charles.

1205
02:03:11,891 --> 02:03:13,220
Charles...

1206
02:03:13,244 --> 02:03:14,922
No, he's not.

1207
02:03:15,538 --> 02:03:17,504
I can still feel him.

1208
02:03:40,318 --> 02:03:42,109
Thank you, Jean.

1209
02:03:43,820 --> 02:03:45,260
Charles?

1210
02:03:45,701 --> 02:03:47,990
Charles, do you know where you are?

1211
02:03:50,521 --> 02:03:52,626
I'm on a beach.

1212
02:03:58,089 --> 02:04:00,020
In Cuba.

1213
02:04:01,364 --> 02:04:03,095
With you.

1214
02:04:03,119 --> 02:04:04,758
What beach?

1215
02:04:11,522 --> 02:04:13,235
Charles Xavier.

1216
02:04:38,454 --> 02:04:40,242
I'm sorry.

1217
02:04:40,465 --> 02:04:43,417
I should never have
taken those from you.

1218
02:04:46,038 --> 02:04:47,627
Hold on!

1219
02:04:51,865 --> 02:04:53,644
What did I miss?

1220
02:04:55,880 --> 02:04:58,284
It seems only by the grace of God,

1221
02:04:58,308 --> 02:04:59,769
that the ominous destruction...

1222
02:04:59,793 --> 02:05:02,614
seen from one end of the globe
to the other, has stopped.

1223
02:05:02,638 --> 02:05:05,385
At a debriefing today,
CIA Special Agent Moira MacTaggert...

1224
02:05:05,409 --> 02:05:07,165
revealed to an investigative
committee...

1225
02:05:07,189 --> 02:05:10,171
The committee was further stunned
to learn that fugitive Erik Lehnsherr...

1226
02:05:10,195 --> 02:05:12,675
aided in defeating
this powerful and unknown...

1227
02:05:12,699 --> 02:05:15,040
I think our prayers were answered.

1228
02:05:15,489 --> 02:05:16,981
Thank you, Mr. President.

1229
02:05:17,005 --> 02:05:18,232
The potential destructive power
of mutants...

1230
02:05:18,256 --> 02:05:20,571
... is sure to fuel new controversy
and debate...

1231
02:05:20,595 --> 02:05:24,652
at a time when mutants were becoming
accepted around the world.

1232
02:05:50,424 --> 02:05:53,308
Mystique told me he is your father.

1233
02:05:53,788 --> 02:05:55,787
Are you gonna tell him?

1234
02:05:57,046 --> 02:05:58,502
I might...

1235
02:05:58,784 --> 02:06:00,282
one day.

1236
02:06:01,452 --> 02:06:04,268
I think for now, I'm just gonna
stick around here for a while.

1237
02:06:09,780 --> 02:06:11,488
Me, too.

1238
02:06:21,492 --> 02:06:24,898
The world's already begun
rebuilding it's arsenals.

1239
02:06:24,922 --> 02:06:27,375
It's human nature, Charles.

1240
02:06:28,964 --> 02:06:30,808
I still have hope.

1241
02:06:31,099 --> 02:06:32,864
Oh, yes.

1242
02:06:33,677 --> 02:06:35,181
"Hope."

1243
02:06:35,528 --> 02:06:37,545
I was right about Raven.

1244
02:06:38,118 --> 02:06:40,331
I was even right about you.

1245
02:06:42,928 --> 02:06:44,903
What about the rest of the world?

1246
02:06:45,802 --> 02:06:49,234
Doesn't it ever wake you up
in the middle of the night?

1247
02:06:50,933 --> 02:06:53,964
The feeling that one day
they'll come for you...

1248
02:06:53,988 --> 02:06:55,966
and your children.

1249
02:06:57,384 --> 02:06:59,278
It does, indeed

1250
02:06:59,279 --> 02:07:01,731
What do you do when
you wake up to that?

1251
02:07:03,055 --> 02:07:05,397
I feel a great swell of pity
for the poor soul...

1252
02:07:05,421 --> 02:07:08,655
that comes to my school
looking for trouble.

1253
02:07:13,456 --> 02:07:16,182
You're sure I can't convince you
to stay?

1254
02:07:17,285 --> 02:07:19,367
You're psychic, Charles.

1255
02:07:19,520 --> 02:07:21,981
You can convince me to do anything.

1256
02:07:24,028 --> 02:07:26,002
Goodbye, old friend.

1257
02:07:26,577 --> 02:07:28,460
Good luck, Professor.

1258
02:07:33,136 --> 02:07:35,603
Forget everything you think you know.

1259
02:07:36,573 --> 02:07:39,369
Whatever lessons you learned
in school...

1260
02:07:39,589 --> 02:07:42,037
whatever your parents taught you.

1261
02:07:43,340 --> 02:07:46,667
None of that matters!

1262
02:07:47,416 --> 02:07:49,737
You're not kids anymore.

1263
02:07:49,761 --> 02:07:51,825
You're not students.

1264
02:07:55,350 --> 02:07:57,281
You're X-men.
