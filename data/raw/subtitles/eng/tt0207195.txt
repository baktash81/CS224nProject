00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,634
<i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,236
Well, now that you've moved in, I see
you're making yourself right at home.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,753
You're not, like, into him, are you?

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,990
You told Summer you weren't coming.
Now you're here with him?

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,878
- Ryan and I aren't here together.
- We're done.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,793
I can't say no to my family.
I'll pay everything back.

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,350
- Put your feelings for him aside.
- He's one of my oldest friends.

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,796
Are you telling me you lost everything?
That is my money! My kids' tuition!

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,599
- I'm sorry.
- Son of a bitch! You're a thief!

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,558
- I'm sorry.
- I just need to be alone right now.

11
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,831
So, what are we doing
in front of this tank?

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,309
Ryan, we're like two samurai, really.

13
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,439
And we need to have respect
for each other before meeting in battle.

14
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,070
And eating lobster is a battle,
as you will soon learn.

15
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,798
Is that a new shirt?

16
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,236
Yeah. Your mom bought me some new
clothes, which she didn't have to do.

17
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,039
Right. You can get a lot of mileage
out of a tank top.

18
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,953
Hey, do you think I could pull off
the wife-beater?

19
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,111
You know, switch up my look?

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,195
Got you. You got your style, I got mine.

21
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,271
- Yeah.
- You're dead.

22
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,192
That was amazing.
A lot of work, but amazing.

23
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,999
What's going on with you and Marissa?
Did you talk to her?

24
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,991
I don't think she wants to talk.

25
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,630
- Everything with her and her dad...
- Do you know what your problem is?

26
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,678
And I speak from experience,
with great authority here.

27
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,638
Is that you really need
to be aggressive, okay?

28
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,713
Her and Luke broke up. You need to go
after her, tell her how you feel. It's easy.

29
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,872
What do we do? Where do we go?
I have no car, no money.

30
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,353
I got it. I picked up extra sailing lessons
this week. Feeling a little bit flush.

31
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,238
Not you too. I can't keep doing this.

32
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,597
Your parents pay for everything.
I can't keep taking their money.

33
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,035
- They're parents. They work for us.
- They're your parents.

34
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,794
They're your guardians.
It's the same principle.

35
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,838
- What are you gonna do for cash, then?
- You're out of here!

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,275
You can't fire me. I quit!

37
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,319
Fine. But you're hooking me up
with free lobster.

38
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,233
This actually works out good for me,
you starting the new job.

39
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,154
I'll have time to do that stuff I haven't
been able to do since you moved here...

40
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,151
...like I'm gonna get to start my novel.

41
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,594
I'll be back by 6.

42
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,432
Yeah. I know. It's 9 now.

43
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,478
Which means I'm gonna have
nine hours of "me" time.

44
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,392
Know what I'm saying? For me, Ryan.

45
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,438
I'm gonna do stuff like learn Chinese,
study my Talmud.

46
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,079
You know, sink my teeth into it.

47
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,912
You gonna be okay?

48
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,399
Yes. Before you moved here...

49
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,632
...all I did was hang out by myself,
so it's really a return to form.

50
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,233
Should we not go?

51
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,358
Maybe we could tell Julie
we're not going and go anyway.

52
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,910
You guys, that's too mean.
We can't do that. Can we, Kirsten?

53
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,470
Absolutely not. We've had this retreat
on the books now for months.

54
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,232
And Julie's looking forward to it.

55
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,437
Yeah, and some of us
were looking forward to retiring early...

56
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,556
...before her husband stole our money.

57
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,711
Dad. What are you doing, man?

58
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,075
I'm waiting for them to disperse.

59
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,357
I left my briefcase in there.
I need to get to work.

60
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,876
- Well, go get it.
- And talk to those women? I can't.

61
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,996
He didn't steal. It wasn't like...

62
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,511
She's our friend.

63
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,195
I can't believe you're defending them.
Jimmy Cooper's a thief and a felon.

64
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,834
Those women are obsessed.

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,514
You kidding?
A scandal this big in a town this small...

66
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,591
...they'll be dining out
on this for months.

67
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,991
What are their kids gonna do?
I mean, with their father in prison?

68
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,515
- You think he's going to jail?
- I heard 10 to 20.

69
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,399
- Is it true he's going to jail?
- He stole a lot of money...

70
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,754
...from powerful people.

71
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,277
What's Marissa gonna do
without her dad?

72
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,590
No one knows if she'll even wanna go.

73
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,594
I don't want to go, I have to go.
The trip's already been paid for.

74
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,356
Besides, if I don't show up, they'll spend
the entire weekend gossiping about me.

75
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,999
You're being a little paranoid.

76
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,470
No, I'm not. I'm sure they think
I've masterminded this whole debacle.

77
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,631
Honey, they're your friends.

78
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,792
Please. They're the gatekeepers
of this entire community...

79
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,032
...a community your daughters and I
would like to remain a part of.

80
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,034
This is my chance to go before the firing
squad and plead for a stay of execution.

81
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,510
I was hoping to be able to talk
this weekend.

82
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,240
This is your mess, Jimmy.
You clean it up.

83
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,473
And when I get back, we'll figure out
what the hell we're gonna tell our girls.

84
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,870
I'm totally crispy.

85
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,636
Let's go do something.
Shopping, get exfoliated, anything.

86
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,156
And pay for it how? I mean, my dad's
credit cards got shut off yesterday.

87
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,515
What about Luke?
I mean, he can pay for you.

88
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,713
- He is your boyfriend, right?
- I don't know.

89
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,038
We left things kind of up in the air.

90
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,115
- You haven't talked since cotillion?
- I haven't talked to anyone, except you.

91
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,714
Okay, this is so not the way
to handle this.

92
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,792
You're gonna become depressed.
Then you'll need medication...

93
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,838
...and then you're gonna stop
feeling like anything.

94
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,350
According to my stepmom.

95
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,948
Let me buy you lunch. My dad gave me
his credit card in case of emergencies.

96
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,396
- And, well, this is an emergency.
- Okay.

97
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,949
All right, man, I'm gonna give you
the rundown.

98
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,119
This...

99
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,714
...is garbage.

100
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,996
It belongs in the garbage.

101
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,799
This belongs over here.

102
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,949
And now for the advanced class.

103
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,113
Hello, Mrs. Palmer. How are you today?
Would you like another glass of merlot?

104
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,918
Coming right up.

105
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,793
Drunk.

106
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,155
- Been working here long?
- Oh, man, too long.

107
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,108
Everybody who comes in is a freak show.
They like $30 entrees on plastic plates...

108
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,671
...$60 bottles of wine in plastic cups,
and service with a big smile.

109
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,638
Welcome to Newport,
where things only appear to be casual.

110
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,758
Of course,
living here does have its upside.

111
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,911
- Hey.
- Hey.

112
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,038
First day on the job.

113
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,917
Well, the food here is really good.

114
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,912
Yeah.

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,195
- How's your dad?
- He's okay.

116
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,838
- How are you?
- Coop! Starving.

117
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,190
- I should get back to work.
- Right.

118
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,954
You wanna hang out sometime?
Go out?

119
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,753
- Like on a date?
- Not a date, just...

120
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,997
- I can't right now.
- No, of course.

121
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,596
- Right.
- But thanks.

122
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,239
See you.

123
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,711
Hey, Jimmy.

124
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,632
- How's it going?
- Never better.

125
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,315
Listen, I was thinking, how would you
like some free legal advice?

126
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,350
You wanna be my lawyer? How long
do you wanna send me away for?

127
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,159
- I got way too big an ego for that.
- Well, that's true.

128
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,835
I wouldn't be representing you. I have
a friend who's a securities attorney.

129
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,877
But I could help you
put together a case.

130
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,395
Why? You don't even like me.

131
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,716
Well, I'm a public defender.

132
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,440
I represent a lot of people I don't like.

133
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,429
I wish somebody had told me
he worked here now.

134
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,794
- Why?
- No reason.

135
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,320
Oh, what do you know? Luke.

136
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,477
- What a coincidence.
- You invited him?

137
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,313
- Gotta pee. See you.
- Wait, Summer.

138
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,711
Hey, man.

139
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,791
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

140
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,077
I hate that kid, man.
I seriously hate that kid.

141
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,832
He walks in like he owns the place.

142
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,155
Let me tell you, that Abercrombie & Fitch
water-polo-playing bitch...

143
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,356
...wouldn't last two minutes in Corona.

144
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,317
- You're from Corona?
- Yeah, man.

145
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,914
- Chino.
- Chino?

146
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,310
It's a long way from home.
That place is no joke.

147
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,118
I'm sorry I haven't called you back.

148
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,795
No worries.
We don't have to talk about it.

149
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,632
- Maybe we should talk about it.
- Why?

150
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,588
Talking about stuff is just gonna get us
all bummed out. Let's just do something.

151
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,593
- Newport kids must make you sick too.
- Sounds like you're a fan.

152
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,957
You know, I like the surf,
I like the tips, love the girls.

153
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,518
It's not all like this.
There's some real people around here.

154
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,033
- Oh, yeah?
- I tell you what.

155
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,998
After work, I'll show you
what I'm talking about. Cool?

156
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,593
Cool.

157
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,556
Holly's beach house. Party.

158
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,438
- I don't really want to.
- Why not?

159
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,116
It's weird. I mean, her dad beat up
my dad at my debutante ball.

160
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,955
You can't blame Holly for that.
I mean, your dad stole all their mon...

161
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,958
Nice.

162
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,598
Normally we don't tip out to trainees,
but you did good, man.

163
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,990
- Thanks.
- All right, now you can buy me a beer.

164
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,958
- I'm gonna grab my sweatshirt.
- All right.

165
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,952
- Hey.
- What's up?

166
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,874
Craziest thing. I was in the neighborhood,
checked my watch, it's 6:00...

167
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,952
...I figured maybe we'd celebrate
your first day on the job.

168
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,519
- Yeah.
- Yo, kid. You ready?

169
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,559
Yeah. I made other plans. This is Donnie.
He grew up in a town next to me.

170
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,358
- Donnie, Seth.
- What's up, man?

171
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,069
Hey, what's up? You guys must
have a lot of catching up to do.

172
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,439
Got some girls we gotta catch up with.
The blond's a dancer.

173
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,429
Yes. The ladies. I feel you.

174
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,716
Well, do you wanna...?
Donnie, is it cool...?

175
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,190
No, no, no. Please, no.
You guys go. I have to...

176
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,432
I was gonna do stuff.
Donnie, it was really good to meet you.

177
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,670
- All right, man. Let's go.
- See you.

178
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,116
So then I'll see you at home tomorrow.

179
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,555
Or tonight. I don't know. Just go.

180
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,359
- You sure you don't want to...?
- No, no. Just...

181
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,636
- All right.
- Okay.

182
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,119
Have fun.

183
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,958
What are you reading?

184
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,236
The new <i>Legion</i> came out Wednesday.

185
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,916
- It's part two of five.
- I liked part one.

186
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,310
Yeah, I'll let you borrow it
when I'm done.

187
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,272
Thanks.

188
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,349
How was last night?

189
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,919
- Fun.
- Cool.

190
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,953
That's cool that, you know, you met
someone that's where you're from.

191
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,759
You know, it's just cool.

192
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,679
I mean, I know he's not
the most sensitive guy in the world.

193
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,479
No one wants to see you
with Luke more than me.

194
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,915
But what you're going through
right now is gnarly.

195
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,640
Luke's a boy. Maybe he can't handle it.

196
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,752
Is it bad to burn on top of a peel?

197
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,069
Yeah. Put 30 on.

198
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,037
Coop, your life will stabilize.

199
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,317
Your parents will work it out.
Your mom will go away this weekend...

200
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,596
...they'll miss each other
and have makeup sex.

201
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,672
- Summer. God.
- It's true.

202
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,879
Marissa.

203
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,753
Hi.

204
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,550
- I'm just heading to the office.
- Yeah, me too.

205
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,349
- You know what...?
- I was thinking...

206
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,429
When I asked you to hang out,
I was asking you out.

207
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,398
- I know.
- I wanted to clear that up...

208
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,471
...because I'm gonna ask you out again.

209
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,631
Do you wanna do something tonight?

210
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,756
I have to babysit for Kaitlin.

211
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,196
But I will be cooking.
Macaroni and cheese. It's my specialty.

212
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,396
So that's a yes.

213
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,993
All right.

214
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,509
Won't these costs
be covered by Chapter 11?

215
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,240
Well, filing for bankruptcy
won't make this go away.

216
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,233
The U.S. Attorney's Office
is involved in this now.

217
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,868
They'll push for fraud,
unauthorized transactions.

218
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,838
Okay, so they fine me,
I go back to work, I make it all back.

219
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,879
Four million dollars? Unless you plan on
going to the track and getting lucky...

220
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,349
Look, if you don't wanna do this...

221
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,954
You're gonna lose your Series 7 license.

222
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,918
It's important that you understand
the predicament you're in.

223
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,672
Look...

224
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,276
...I get it from my wife every day,
my daughters won't talk to me...

225
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,991
...I got beat up in front of everyone
at the most elegant event of the year.

226
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,594
I get it. Okay, man?
I definitely understand.

227
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,155
Well, look. You know, we're both tired.

228
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,789
Maybe we should take a break,
go out.

229
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,632
What do you wanna do?

230
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,917
Well, our wives are away
for the weekend. We could...

231
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,508
Well, what did we do
before we got married?

232
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,511
Put that thing away, Kirsten.

233
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,079
I'm sorry.

234
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,279
We put a bid in on a new development,
and the counteroffer's outrageous.

235
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,115
We're here to relax.
Just because you have a job...

236
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,635
She's lucky she has a career.

237
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,470
I mean, it's not luck.
You're a very hard worker.

238
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,356
God knows I could use
my own income right about now.

239
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,355
Let's say it. I better enjoy the weekend
because I won't be back for a while.

240
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,590
Don't say that. It's not true.

241
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,196
Jules, tell me. Did you have
any idea about any of it?

242
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,237
How would I have known?

243
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,359
We have a deal. My domain's the kitchen
and the bedroom. His is the office.

244
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,318
- I held up my end of the bargain.
- You poor thing.

245
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,950
Believe me, if I'd known, I'd have
taken my girls out of the country.

246
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,031
It's them I'm concerned about.

247
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,794
Having to live with the shame
of what your father's done?

248
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,679
- Maybe we shouldn't talk about this.
- Oh, no, I don't mind.

249
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,957
To be honest, I blame myself.

250
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,396
I feel like I should have known,
like I should have sensed it somehow.

251
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,109
- How could you? You had no idea.
- Don't beat yourself up. You're a victim.

252
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,952
You're right, I know.
It's just...

253
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,519
What else can I do?

254
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,992
- I have the name of a great attorney.
- A good attorney could really help Jimmy.

255
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,277
It's for Julie, to divorce his sorry ass.

256
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,513
Girls, this isn't helping Julie relax.
Isn't that why we're here?

257
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,990
Kirsten's right.
I mean, you wouldn't get a divorce.

258
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,472
Would you?

259
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,957
- Hey.
- Hey.

260
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,112
How do you feel about
a little thing that I like to call...

261
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,113
...the IMAX Experience?

262
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,872
- This town sucks. The best I could do.
- I can't.

263
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,792
I'm hanging out with Marissa tonight.

264
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,235
We'll get a third ticket.
I doubt it'll sell out.

265
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,152
Well, she's got her sister.

266
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,276
Fine. Four tickets then. I like Kaitlin.

267
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,670
She's nice, and she's smart,
for a fifth-grader.

268
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,149
Actually, I...

269
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,710
...was gonna go over there.
Help her babysit.

270
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,754
Nice. The babysit.

271
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,071
I see. Stepping it up, taking it
to the next level. I can respect that.

272
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,992
Yeah. Hey, Donnie, I'm gonna head out.

273
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,073
I'm gonna head out too. I can't believe
we survived this shift. I'm so hung-over.

274
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,834
What are you gonna do now?

275
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,991
- I got plans.
- All right, man.

276
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,237
I have an extra ticket to the IMAX.
Shark movie, hammerheads, very violent.

277
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,470
- What are you, like, 8?
- Got a better idea?

278
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,599
I got a house party in Long Beach.
Six kegs, crazy honeys.

279
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,035
- Okay, yes. That is better.
- Wanna come?

280
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,269
Is that...? Is that cool?

281
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,955
- Let me just change up.
- All right.

282
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,997
- I do enjoy the crazy honeys.
- You're not going.

283
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,116
Okay, Mom, except that I am.

284
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,714
It's a shady neighborhood.
It's pretty hardcore.

285
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,711
Dude, it's Long Beach, not Chechnya.

286
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,075
Guys like Donnie,
you don't exactly know them...

287
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,629
...and they don't exactly know
kids like you.

288
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,314
- So I shouldn't talk about Grey Poupon?
- How you gonna get there?

289
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,472
I got my mom's Range Rover.
Well, I'll park it up the street.

290
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,473
Look, man, Donnie's a good guy, right?
He's cool, right?

291
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,189
So maybe this way we can all
be friends. We can all hang out.

292
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,552
- You boys game or what?
- Yeah, man.

293
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,072
We'll go for one hour.

294
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,952
Do you know how long it's been
since I've had a steak?

295
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,519
I live with three vegetarians.

296
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,399
You know how long it's been
since we had beer in the house?

297
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,278
I'm so sick of chardonnay and merlot.

298
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,668
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

299
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,198
You wanna grab that?
These are almost done.

300
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,358
- Hello?
- Jimmy? Did I dial your number?

301
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,112
No, no. I'm at your place.

302
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,879
Oh, working on the case?

303
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,508
Well, we're taking a break, actually.

304
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,115
With Sandy?

305
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,999
Yeah. We're doing guy stuff.

306
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,275
All right. Well, when you finish
doing guy stuff...

307
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,433
...would you have Sandy give me a call?
I called to see if everything was okay.

308
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,433
- Is it?
- Well...

309
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,238
I guess. I don't know.

310
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,790
You know,
I've been really worried about you.

311
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,269
<i>Thanks. I appreciate it.</i>

312
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,319
Well, I'll talk to you when I get back.
Take care, Jimmy.

313
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,793
Your concern for my husband
is really touching.

314
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,358
Can you believe that? God.

315
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,111
She really is a dancer.

316
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,077
Chino. Come here, man.
I want you to meet some of my boys.

317
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,038
- We have 45 minutes.
- We should invite her to the pool house.

318
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,872
- Don't say "pool house."
- Right.

319
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,396
Oh, dude, I thought you said
you played before.

320
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,120
Well, some people
have a natural talent.

321
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,869
Not me.

322
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,589
I haven't played video games in, like...
I can't remember last time I played.

323
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,751
Are we old? Because...

324
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,148
...if I didn't know better,
I'd swear I was still 16.

325
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,392
Hell, I'm still 22.
It was the best year of my life.

326
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,958
- Yeah? Why 22?
- That's when I met Kirsten.

327
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,316
- Why 16?
- Oh, that's when...

328
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,511
...I met Kirsten.

329
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,875
- Hello?
- <i>Marissa?</i>

330
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,554
Hey. Where are you?

331
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,395
What'd I tell you, man?
How much better is this than Newport?

332
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,438
I got dragged to a party,
but I'm leaving. I'm on my way.

333
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,229
I just gotta get
Seth away from this...

334
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,789
- This dancer.
- Dancer?

335
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,119
It's a long story, but I'll be there soon.

336
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,158
- Save me some mac and cheese?
- Sure. See you.

337
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,192
- No, no way...
- Seth.

338
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,678
One second.

339
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,071
Hang on a second. Listen,
I am really connecting with this girl.

340
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,074
She just moved here with her sister from
Uzbekistan, they're saving for a condo.

341
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,673
Nice. That hits here.

342
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,833
Now, she does have a serious boyfriend,
but she's looking into...

343
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,357
Good luck with the condo.

344
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,830
Some dude just demo'd
a Range Rover.

345
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,309
That car's messed up.

346
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,314
This happened in the parking lot
of the IMAX theater?

347
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,318
Shark movies bring out
a rough crowd.

348
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,869
I'll call the insurance company, but
you're explaining this to your mother.

349
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,917
It could get ugly.

350
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,559
Yeah.

351
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,229
So did you call Marissa?

352
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,198
I tried her again this morning.
She doesn't wanna talk.

353
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,114
- I'm sorry I salted your game, man.
- I gotta get to work.

354
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,158
I'll give you Richard's number
when we get back. He's the best.

355
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,231
He did Carol's divorce.
She got everything.

356
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,118
Thanks. That'd be great.

357
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,477
- You're really considering a divorce?
- Why, are you gonna tell Jimmy?

358
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,637
Julie needs to protect herself.

359
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,031
I can't believe you're encouraging this.
When your husband had an affair...

360
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,350
...no one gave you
a divorce attorney's number.

361
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,829
Kirsten, that was very uncalled-for.

362
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,595
What's uncalled-for is your
$500-a-day coke habit in college.

363
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,196
- It was just sophomore year.
- What Jimmy did was wrong.

364
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,158
Spare me. You have a Guatemalan family
cleaning your house...

365
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,470
...for less than minimum wage.

366
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,310
I have spent this entire weekend
listening to you women judge Jimmy.

367
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,109
Yes, he made a big mistake. But life is
complicated, and none of us is perfect.

368
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,317
- Not even you, Julie.
- And what is that supposed to mean?

369
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,313
He didn't buy ponies and jewelry
for himself.

370
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,199
How interesting that you
should take his side.

371
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,952
Shower time. Limo leaves at 6.

372
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,510
He did this to give you everything.
And now you're just gonna leave him?

373
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,079
He lied to me, Kirsten.

374
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,549
You lied to yourself! I know Jimmy.

375
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,952
I know. I've heard. He still has
your prom photo up on our wall.

376
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,672
- It's all in the past.
- Really?

377
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,833
You think it's a coincidence that we
ended up living next door to you?

378
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,879
I'm the one who married him.
This is my problem, not yours.

379
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,197
Who knew that
when he knocked me up...

380
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,955
...it'd be the best thing
that ever happened to you?

381
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,398
- Hey.
- Hey.

382
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,632
Your dad let me in.
Seems like he's doing better.

383
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,473
Yeah, I guess.

384
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,917
Do you need to get that?

385
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,152
It's probably just Summer calling
about another party at Holly's.

386
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,550
Yes, another one of those.

387
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,240
- So how'd it go with the dancer?
- Actually...

388
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,154
...that's what I wanted to talk about.
Last night was totally my fault.

389
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,313
Okay? Ryan was extremely bummed he
didn't get to make his Blockbuster night.

390
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,711
I know you're going through a lot,
and you didn't need to get stood up.

391
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,714
- So I apologize.
- Wow, that's very...

392
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,713
...thoughtful.
- Well, he's pretty mad at me right now.

393
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,269
Why don't you help me out?
How about another date?

394
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,755
He's a good cook.

395
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,276
I tell you, one good swing...

396
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,317
...and I love this game.

397
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,879
Nice drive.

398
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,355
So I talked to my friend,
the securities attorney, this morning.

399
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,999
Working on the weekend?

400
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,230
Working for you, to keep you out of jail.

401
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,472
- He's pretty sure he can make it happen.
- Excellent.

402
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,870
It's contingent upon you
making full restitution.

403
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,473
You'll lose your license and never be
allowed near an investment account.

404
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,349
- But little or no jail time.
- So I gotta pay back everything I lost.

405
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,197
And even then, there are no guarantees.
But it's your only option.

406
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,273
Well, that's not an option. I mean, where
the hell am I gonna find $4 million?

407
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,194
Your house is valued at 3.2, you got
2.6 in equity. That's a good start.

408
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,351
You want me to sell my house?

409
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,033
Julie will...

410
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,919
- She'll leave me.
- Julie cares about you and the kids.

411
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,958
She won't care about losing the house,
if it means keeping you.

412
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,599
Whose wife are we talking about?

413
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,430
No. We gotta come up
with something else.

414
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,478
This is it. This is a gift. Be grateful.

415
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,675
- Grateful?
- Did you think it would just go away?

416
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,910
That there would be no consequences?
Get real.

417
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,436
Who are you to tell me to get real?
You live in a fantasy land.

418
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,637
Your wife is rich. You live in
a house you've never paid for.

419
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,995
You get fired,
Kirsten wouldn't even notice it.

420
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,233
You have no idea what
it's like to provide for a family.

421
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,555
I think there's more to providing
for a family than money.

422
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,992
Wanna be there when Marissa graduates?
You wanna watch Kaitlin grow up?

423
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,720
You can start over.
You can start a new life.

424
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,032
I don't want a new life.
I want my old one back.

425
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,474
But I guess
that's not gonna happen, huh?

426
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,714
- Hey.
- What's up?

427
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,678
Seth Cohen, your friendly
neighborhood pimp, at your service.

428
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,149
I talked with Marissa.
It's totally handled.

429
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,311
I'll be right back with your drinks.

430
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,754
What are you talking about?

431
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,674
It turns out that I'm skilled at getting
a date, provided it's not for me.

432
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,958
You'll have the house to yourself. She'll
be coming over, and you'll be cooking.

433
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,439
- What's up, man?
- Hey.

434
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,239
What's the agenda for tonight?
Any plans?

435
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,118
- Not really, no.
- Anything going on?

436
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,919
There's a lame beach party,
typical Newport scene.

437
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,389
You know what, man? We should go.

438
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,955
No. It's not for me. It's gonna be
water-polo guys and their girlfriends.

439
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,509
I don't get the whole
water-polo thing down here.

440
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,830
Nor do I. A bunch of dudes
who enjoy wearing Speedos.

441
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,117
- What do they know about partying?
- I couldn't agree more.

442
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,873
But the girls are hot.

443
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,635
So with the right attitude
and a couple cocktails, it could be fun.

444
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,439
If it's not, we'll make it fun.
Life is what you make it.

445
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,475
- That's very wise, Donnie.
- Tell you what, man.

446
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,996
Here's what we'll do. We're gonna go.
I'll call a couple of my boys.

447
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,357
We'll drink their beer, dance with
their honeys and have a good time.

448
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,555
- All right.
- All right?

449
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,153
All right.

450
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,358
Enough with the moody scowl thing.
Please, it's not a big deal.

451
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,990
- You're taking him to a Newport party?
- Exactly. It'll be on my turf.

452
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:35,039
I don't have turf, but if I did, this would
be it. And Summer will be there.

453
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,954
- I don't know about this, Seth.
- I do. It's fine. Not a big deal. I promise.

454
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,998
Now, you got a date, okay?
So you have to go.

455
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,351
Make me proud.

456
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,872
Put a sock on the door.

457
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,433
Hey.

458
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,550
I brought you some leftovers.

459
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,034
It should go well
with the grilled cheese.

460
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,594
My specialty.

461
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,309
- Very fancy.
- Hey, don't knock it till you've tried it.

462
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,793
Dinner is served.

463
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,318
Kind of lame, right?

464
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,711
I'm seeing lots of potential
in here, actually.

465
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,234
Hey.

466
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,510
Where's Marissa?

467
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,553
She's at home.

468
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,954
We're...

469
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,031
...sort of taking a break.

470
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,351
You are?

471
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,952
Are you okay?

472
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,914
That was the best grilled cheese ever.

473
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,275
Yeah. Your mac and cheese
was pretty good too.

474
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,795
Yeah? Well, it tasted better last night.

475
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,791
Hey.

476
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,158
- But, hey, we're here now, right?
- Yeah.

477
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,551
I'm glad we are.

478
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,636
So how are you with everything?

479
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,189
I'm okay, I guess.

480
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,954
I mean, I still don't know
what's gonna happen.

481
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,191
My parents are fighting all the time.

482
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,511
My family's not perfect.

483
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,269
Not even close, but...

484
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,992
...I just don't want us to fall apart.

485
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,353
Let's do something fun.
You can still have fun, right?

486
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,078
I don't know.

487
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,596
What if you don't have a choice?

488
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,637
What does that mean?

489
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,790
No, no, no. Don't. Stop.

490
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,039
Okay.

491
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,158
I'm taking you with me.

492
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,671
What's up, girl?
You don't like to dance?

493
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,036
Not with you.

494
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,796
I'm trying to get to the bar.

495
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,310
You're fine, you know that?

496
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,993
Good one.

497
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,993
But aren't you, like, the busboy?

498
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,397
- Random.
- Who is that guy?

499
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,276
What's up? Somebody got a problem?

500
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,629
Hey, hey.

501
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,029
- What's going on?
- These kids are mad-dogging me.

502
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,756
- Then why don't we go? I'm ready.
- No, I'm ready.

503
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,636
Yeah, what? That's what I'm saying.
Life is what you make it.

504
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,199
Hurry up, I'm freezing.

505
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,955
- You've got goosebumps.
- I know. Towel.

506
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,997
All right. Here.

507
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,319
- You want a sweatshirt?
- No. Can I borrow a tank top...

508
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,711
...so I can look as cool as you?
- Yeah. You wanna go back in the pool?

509
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,199
No.

510
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,712
Do you have to...?

511
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,479
I'm sorry.

512
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,476
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Seth. Donnie's kind of psycho.

513
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,152
Okay, not really a good time
right now.

514
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,995
I wouldn't call if it wasn't serious.
Take my dad's car, meet me at Holly's.

515
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,392
I'll be right there.

516
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,320
Okay. So that was Seth.

517
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,515
I gotta go pick him up.

518
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,877
- He's at Holly's if you want to...
- I can't go there.

519
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,553
Right.

520
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,751
Okay. So...

521
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,031
Sorry. I...

522
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,758
No. It's okay.

523
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,031
You know how long
I've wanted to do this?

524
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,077
As long as I have?

525
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,474
You guys should have
broken up a long time ago.

526
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,316
No. Chill. Chill!

527
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,629
Seriously, relax.

528
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,360
- What's up, bro? You want a drink?
- No, no.

529
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,635
- You sure?
- Yes.

530
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,472
It's vodka, very good. I'll do the...

531
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,716
That sounded expensive.

532
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,839
Come on.

533
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,472
You go. I'II...

534
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,471
I'm right behind you.

535
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,552
- That's my blender!
- Check it out. It's Abercrombie.

536
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,516
Or are you Fitch?

537
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,353
- Jackass, what's your problem?
- You.

538
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,114
- Luke, you really don't want to be...
- Shut up, Cohen.

539
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,191
How'd you get in here anyway?

540
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,077
Look, I don't know who you are.
You best be leaving.

541
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,834
Or what? What you gonna do, man?

542
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,036
What, you afraid I'm gonna
mess up your hair?

543
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,077
- Donnie.
- What's up, Ryan?

544
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,710
Should've figured he's a friend of yours.
Take him back to the trailer park.

545
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,474
- We should go.
- What did you say to me?

546
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,756
All right. Let's go.

547
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,994
What's up now?
Who's the tough guy now?

548
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,237
How much you hate this kid? The way
he talks to you like you're trash?

549
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,872
- What about you, Seth?
- Yeah, he's definitely flawed.

550
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,157
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Look at the role reversal now.

551
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,709
- Who's the bitch?
- Look, you scared him. Put it down.

552
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,510
I'm just trying to have a good time. I'm
trying to have fun. You boys having fun?

553
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,479
What's the matter with you, man?
I was just messing around.

554
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,949
- Oh, my God!
- We gotta go. Let's go.

555
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,792
Oh, my God.
Call an ambulance, somebody!

556
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,269
- You're gonna be okay.
- Call the cops, 911.

557
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:47,118
I guess this is me.
Thanks for a relaxing weekend, ladies.

558
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,748
I'm off to fire my cleaning lady.

559
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,908
- Okay. See you at spinning.
- Bye, Taryn.

560
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,196
Is it warm in here?

561
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,590
Could you turn the air on, please?

562
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,198
I'm sorry if I upset you.
It wasn't my place.

563
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,756
I remember as a kid,
if I saw a limousine driving...

564
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,480
...I'd always try to see
through the tinted window...

565
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,837
...wondering what kind of life
the people inside lived.

566
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,993
How glamorous and lucky.
Who knew, right?

567
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,399
You knew.

568
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,838
You were probably in there,
staring back at me.

569
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,355
Which means I've been
jealous of you since I was 8.

570
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,836
When I met Jimmy, I had nothing.
No money.

571
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,476
I don't wanna go back
to being nothing again.

572
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,633
You won't.

573
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,758
You have a family, you have Jimmy.
He loves you.

574
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,473
Not as much as he loved you.

575
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,153
But I knew that when I married him.

576
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,908
I was winning the lottery.
Great guy, great life.

577
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,354
And he was doing the honorable thing.

578
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,238
It's your turn, Julie.

579
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,319
Don't abandon him.

580
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,951
Hey. It's me.

581
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,031
Yeah. No.

582
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,432
I'm sorry.

583
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,318
I'm at the hospital.

584
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,392
No. Everything's fine, but...

585
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,991
...I think you'll wanna get down here.

586
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,473
- Hey.
- Hey.

587
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,517
Hi. How'd it go?

588
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,398
Not well.

589
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,913
How about you?

590
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,559
The same.

591
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,276
Sandy, what happened to our car?

592
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,232
Seth will explain everything.

593
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,834
- Where is he?
- I don't know. He's out, I guess.

594
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,875
You bought beer?

595
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,479
I miss beer.

596
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,508
- Want a sip?
- I want more than that.

597
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,033
Really?

598
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,719
You know, the boys might be out
for a while.

599
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,229
Hey.

600
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,634
I didn't hear you come in.

601
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,000
So how was your weekend?
You win the lottery?

602
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,838
That's funny.

603
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,630
Do you wanna sit or stand?
Because I've got some news.

604
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,397
It's not gonna be easy.

605
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,471
We've... Well...

606
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,870
...you've got a decision to make.

607
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,514
What is it, Jimmy?

608
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:18,349
We can liquidate our assets,
sell the house...

609
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,509
...and start all over with nothing
as a family.

610
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,029
Or we can declare bankruptcy...

611
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,997
...keep the house...

612
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,869
...and I see you and the girls
in about eight to 10 years.

613
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,112
It's up to you.
Whatever you wanna do, I'll do.

614
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,795
The cops said Donnie wasn't gonna
get far before they caught him.

615
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,993
If you wanna make some extra money,
I'm sure there's a job at the restaurant.

616
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:55,314
No. That's okay. It'd be good to take
some "me" time, work on the novel.

617
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,390
Tonight would make a good chapter.

618
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,712
Are you scared?

619
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,232
Yeah.

620
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,830
- Hi.
- Hey.

621
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,958
He's okay.
He's with his parents, third floor.

622
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,872
It's just his arm.

623
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,399
So this guy, was he a friend of yours?

624
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,437
No, not really.

625
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,077
- Well, thanks for calling me.
- Yeah.

626
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,553
I...

627
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,631
- I should go.
- I can wait.

628
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,913
No, it's okay. I might be a while.

629
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,754
Never thought the day would end here.

630
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,918
I'm sorry, man.

631
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,038
You were right. I shouldn't have
brought Donnie to that party.

632
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,034
No, it's my fault. If it wasn't for me,
you never would have met him.

633
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,350
Luke wouldn't be in the hospital.

634
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,593
I feel like ever since I got here,
everyone's life's just gotten worse.

635
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,637
Not everyone.

636
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,317
All I was thinking about
in that ambulance was...

637
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,268
...I'm so gone, back to Chino.
Or worse.

638
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,318
You're not going anywhere,
so don't worry about it.

639
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,793
I do think from now on, though,
we gotta stick together...

640
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,873
...because united we're unstoppable,
but divided it's like...

641
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,713
- People get shot.
- That's what I'm saying.

642
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,791
That's what I'm saying.
