1
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,350
Come on, butthead.

2
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:30,680
It can't be that hard.

3
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,650
Just light the stupid thing already.

4
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,750
All right, I'm doing the best I can.

5
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,220
It's not as easy as it looks, you know.

6
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,900
Oh, please.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,360
Hey, come on, guys, let me light 'em.

8
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,370
If your parents knew I was letting you touch matches,

9
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,770
they'd probably kill me.

10
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,870
Besides, I don't want you to burn the place down.

11
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,600
Yeah, Kyle, please let Michael do it.

12
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,440
I don't really want to sit out here in the dark all night.

13
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,740
OK, all right.

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,910
I really don't want to sit here all night

15
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,740
and listen to you whine either.

16
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,750
Where's the matches?

17
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:00,780
Where are you?

18
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,250
Hey, who needs a lantern?

19
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,380
Why don't we just use these guys to see?

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,050
Ah, Josh, why don't you let those poor things go?

21
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,020
No way.

22
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,690
I want to show them to Mom tomorrow.

23
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,620
Yeah, they'll look real neat during the day.

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,260
So I'll wait until tomorrow night.

25
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,860
Josh, they'll be dead by tomorrow night.

26
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,830
No, they won't.

27
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,130
I poked holes in the top.

28
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,630
Look, just bring them over here, so I can

29
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,070
see what I'm doing, all right?

30
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:21,830
Hey, better than a flashlight, huh?

31
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,270
Just bring 'em over here.

32
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,540
What's grosser than gross?

33
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,140
Oh, no, not your dumb joke.

34
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,440
Come on, what's grosser than gross?

35
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,410
I don't know.

36
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,010
What's grosser than gross?

37
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:38,350
Eating a bowl of rice when one of 'em gets up and walks away.

38
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,520
Oh no, please stop.

39
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,450
I think my sides are going to split.

40
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,790
What's grosser than gross?

41
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,090
Let there be light.

42
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:44,820
Cool.

43
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,390
Finally.

44
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,590
So we can see.

45
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,800
Now what?

46
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,930
I brought some video game cartridges.

47
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,300
What are we supposed to do with video game cartridges?

48
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,700
Play video games.

49
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,700
On what?

50
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,640
Oh yeah.

51
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,940
I didn't think about it.

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,440
You're so lame.

53
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,570
What's grosser than gross?

54
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,540
Your face, which I liked better

55
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,540
when it was dark in here.

56
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,540
Now shut up.

57
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,150
Ehh wrong.

58
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,780
Eating a bowl of cornflakes when your brother walks in and says,

59
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,520
hey, where's my scab collection?

60
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,920
Oh, that is disgusting.

61
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,520
You know, I think that actually happened

62
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,820
to us once at our house.

63
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,160
What's grosser than gross?

64
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,820
Enough already.

65
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,120
10 dead puppies in a barrel.

66
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,560
What's grosser than that?

67
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,960
I don't know.

68
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,460
What's grosser than 10 dead puppies in a barrel.

69
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,200
One dead puppy and 10 barrels.

70
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,370
I think I actually like that one.

71
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,200
What's grosser than--

72
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,770
I'm gonna smack you so hard.

73
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,370
Hey, do you guys really want to know

74
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,940
what's grosser than gross?

75
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,380
What do you mean?

76
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,680
I mean, do you want to hear something that's really

77
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,440
gross that really happened?

78
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,150
Please, anything to keep him from telling more retarded

79
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,320
jokes.

80
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,620
Is it grosser than eating a scab collection?

81
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,650
Yeah.

82
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,620
Definitely grosser than that.

83
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,190
Well, what is it?

84
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,290
Well, there was this lady who went

85
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,430
into a fast food restaurant to get herself some chicken.

86
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,930
Thank you, and come again.

87
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,970
Welcome to Tennessee Frick-a-See Chicken.

88
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,200
May I take your order, please?

89
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,540
Yeah.

90
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,140
I'd like the 15-piece bucket and a large chocolate shake.

91
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,440
For here or to go?

92
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,840
For here.

93
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:17,920
Could I interest you in our new Cajun Keels today?

94
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,650
Um, maybe later.

95
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:26,860
That'll be $8.95.

96
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,990
I'll be right back.

97
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,400
Thank you, and come again.

98
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,970
Thank you.

99
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,200
Welcome to Tennessee Frick-a-See Chicken.

100
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,040
May I take your order, please?

101
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:47,550
Yeah, give me the Gettysburg Nuggets to go.

102
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,470
Mmm!

103
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,190
Oh!

104
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,150
Oh!

105
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,920
Oh!

106
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,940
It was a big ol' rat, extra crispy.

107
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,170
Oh, ew, that's disgusting.

108
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,770
Hey, did she barf?

109
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,480
How's he supposed to know that?

110
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,680
I don't know.

111
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,250
Wouldn't you barf if you bit into a big, hairy rat?

112
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,150
I'm gonna go out on a limb here, fellas,

113
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,490
and say, yeah, she probably got the urge to regurg.

114
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,590
Ew!

115
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,890
Oh! Hey, wait, wait.

116
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,060
I know one.

117
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,520
And this is one really happened too.

118
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,730
What, the time when Mom found a Band-Aid in her soup?

119
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,760
No, no, no.

120
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,060
Besides, that wasn't a Band-Aid.

121
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,630
It was one of those moist towelette thingys.

122
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:15,130
No, no, no, this happened in California, at Wacky Kingdom.

123
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,900
Well, what happened?

124
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,370
Yeah, what happened?

125
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,940
Well, the first day they opened the Haunted Estate,

126
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,410
there was this old man.

127
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,920
Our ghouls are aware of your presence,

128
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,090
and have decided to meet you personally.

129
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,230
I could have gone on "It's Such a Wee World"

130
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,200
or "The Enchanted Wiki Hut."

131
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,500
Why did I have to go on this stupid ride?

132
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,410
Oh!

133
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,180
Help!

134
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,450
Let me out of here!

135
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,650
Please!

136
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,590
Help!

137
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,820
Help!

138
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,260
Ah!

139
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,000
Ah!

140
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,400
Ah!

141
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,200
The spirits are pleased you have come

142
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,270
and wish to further welcome you to their haunting ground.

143
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:31,540
No, please, I think I'd like to get out now!

144
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,650
Help me!

145
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,650
Please, you must help me.

146
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,690
He's right behind me.

147
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,220
He'll kill me if he finds me!

148
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,460
I-- I really think I'd like to get off now.

149
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,830
Will somebody please stop this ride?

150
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:53,800
I found you.

151
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,800
It's too late!

152
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:16,020
ANNOUNCER Did you say you wanted to meet more of our fiends--

153
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,690
ah, I mean friends?

154
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,490
No!

155
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,890
No!

156
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,360
The family ghoul-ery, living dead portraits of some

157
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,700
of our most famous guests.

158
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,970
Jonathan Livingston Seagu, ship ahoy.

159
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:35,410
Mr. Mortis, the undertaker, of course.

160
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,810
Farmer Hacket, ready to whack it.

161
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:39,850
Beware.

162
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,950
They hitch a ride home with you.

163
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,160
Please watch your step and enjoy the rest of the day.

164
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:58,260
Please watch your step and enjoy the rest of the day.

165
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,430
Please watch your step and enjoy the--

166
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,580
He died of fright, and that's why it's such a wussy ride now.

167
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,220
They had to shut it down and completely redo it.

168
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,350
Oh yeah.

169
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,950
I-- I-- I think I remember meeting

170
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:27,560
someone who knew a guy that went on the ride the very same day.

171
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,730
You think it's a wussy ride now?

172
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,900
I think it's still scary.

173
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,160
I rest my case.

174
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,730
Hey, guys, this is pretty good.

175
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,970
Do you know any more gross, spooky stories that are true?

176
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,900
Hey, I do. I've got a great one.

177
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,270
Wait, wait, we've already heard about the dead puppies

178
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,470
and the scab collection.

179
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,440
No, no, this is much better than that,

180
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,440
and I know it's true because it happened to a friend

181
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,810
of mine's grandmother.

182
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,810
Swear to God.

183
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,880
Well, go on.

184
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,180
What happened?

185
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,550
Go on.

186
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,390
Well, she had just finished giving her puddle

187
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,290
a bath in the kitchen sink.

188
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,560
Here we go, Pookums.

189
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:09,100
Ohh, Mama's little baby is gonna be so handsome when he's done.

190
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,040
Now we've just gotta try the baby off so he

191
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,470
won't get the sniffy-wifflies.

192
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,040
Just in-- right in there.

193
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,610
There we go.

194
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,550
There.

195
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,290
Just three minutes, babykins, and you'll be all

196
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:41,300
dry and such a handsome boy.

197
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,650
Yes, we're almost through, sweetheart.

198
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,090
There we go.

199
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,360
You're all done.

200
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,670
Pookums?

201
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,090
And it blew up, all over the place.

202
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,390
That really didn't happen.

203
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,320
Yes, it did.

204
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,660
It happened to--

205
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,290
I know, I know, your friend's grandmother.

206
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,330
Yeah!

207
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,390
Hey guys, who cares?

208
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,360
It was a great story.

209
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,360
Yeah.

210
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,200
Poodle in a microwave, yeck.

211
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,630
Hey, I thought of one I know you guys

212
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,030
definitely haven't heard of.

213
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,300
What?

214
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,370
And I happen to know it's true.

215
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,640
And wait, wait, wait a minute.

216
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,210
This isn't that dumb story about the time

217
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,580
you and your friends found that pirate ship in an old cave?

218
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,880
Naw, it's better than that.

219
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,780
What?

220
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,820
Ah, naw, you guys wouldn't believe me.

221
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,120
I--

222
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,050
Sure we will.

223
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,980
What is it?

224
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,150
Come on.

225
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,250
All right.

226
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,290
But be warned.

227
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:49,930
This story is guaranteed to give you the willies.

228
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,180
This is something that happened before we

229
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,750
moved out here, back at a school that my dad used to work at.

230
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,360
Uncle Henry used to work at a school?

231
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,190
Yeah, he's worked at a few of 'em.

232
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,130
Yeah, we knew that.

233
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,960
Remember, Josh? Go on.

234
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,100
What happened?

235
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,830
This happened to a kid named Danny Hollister,

236
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,630
back in the town of Greeley.

237
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,560
Hey, Daddy, what'd Mommy pack us for lunch?

238
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,030
Hey, come, Rudy. That's mine.

239
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,270
Give it back.

240
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:15,470
Anyone want a banana?

241
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:16,670
Come on, give it back.

242
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,270
What if I don't feel like it?

243
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:19,570
Just leave me alone.

244
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,970
Little Danny wants us to leave him alone.

245
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,140
Brad, why don't you leave little Danny alone.

246
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,080
Sure thing, Rudy.

247
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,580
Better pick up your mess, Hollister.

248
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,610
You don't want to get into trouble.

249
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,490
All right.

250
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,920
Hey, guys, look, Danny's drawing

251
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,960
won first place in the art festival.

252
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:39,960
Isn't that nice?

253
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,730
Yeah, he's a real artist.

254
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,730
You know, I think I'd like to have it.

255
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,430
No, Rudy, don't!

256
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:46,800
Please!

257
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,000
Don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt it.

258
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,070
I'll just put it somewhere real special.

259
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:53,810
Oops.

260
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,040
Now it's first place trash.

261
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,640
You guys are gonna get in trouble.

262
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,080
No we're not.

263
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,410
Because if you tell anyone, you know what'll happen.

264
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,550
Hold on to him, guys.

265
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,090
I got an idea.

266
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,690
What are you doin'?

267
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,860
Making sure little Danny doesn't

268
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,360
go crying to the principal.

269
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,230
Oh you press the third valve down.

270
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,870
And the music goes down and around below,

271
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:26,170
below, below, diddy-whoa-ho-ho.

272
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,570
Listen to jazz come out.

273
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:32,780
Oh, the music goes around and around, below, below, below.

274
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:39,320
--The music goes down and around below, below, below.

275
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,060
Well, my goodness, what the dickens

276
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,160
are you doing hanging up there?

277
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,470
Danny?

278
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,570
Danny Hollister's that you?

279
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,940
Say, you know, this ain't a public hanging.

280
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,310
You kids ought to be back in your classes.

281
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,210
You heard what I said.

282
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,520
I said, skedaddle!

283
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,450
Skedaddle!

284
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,790
Well, dunk my bread in the gravy.

285
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,430
How did you manage to get yourself in a mess like /

286
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,460
Don't worry, son.

287
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,530
I'll get you right on down.

288
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,100
Uh-huh.

289
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,540
So that's what happened to my plumber's helper, huh?

290
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,740
Hang on, son.

291
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,080
There we are.

292
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,380
Here, let me tell you there.

293
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,750
Oh, darn!

294
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,350
Here, let me help you.

295
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,620
There.

296
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,220
Are you all right?

297
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,490
Huh?

298
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,530
Yeah?

299
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:58,130
Who hung you up there, Danny?

300
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:58,830
I can't tell.

301
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,130
Why can't you tell me?

302
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,200
But if I tell, they'll beat me up.

303
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,840
Oh, no siree, Bob.

304
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,770
Nobody's gonna beat you up as long as I'm custodian

305
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,040
of Greeley Elementary School.

306
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,010
Now, you tell me who did it.

307
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,410
Uh-huh.

308
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,450
Was it Rudy Kobernicky and his two sidekicks Frick and Frack?

309
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,380
Uh-huh.

310
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,420
I thought as much.

311
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,450
I didn't tell you!

312
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,390
Oh, no, of course you didn't.

313
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,720
And if anybody asks me, I'll say absolutely not.

314
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,960
He's zipper lipped.

315
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,960
I'll say I tore out your fingernails,

316
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,290
and still you wouldn't squeal.

317
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,260
Thanks.

318
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,100
Come on, we better get this cleaned up.

319
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,070
OK.

320
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,000
Before somebody else trips over it.

321
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:37,940
OK.

322
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,610
And listen, don't look so worried.

323
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:44,340
I mean, those kids are just show-offs.

324
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,340
They're all bark.

325
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,510
They're no bite.

326
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,250
And I'll tell you something else.

327
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,110
I have a feeling they're gonna get what's

328
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,250
coming to them sooner or later.

329
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:55,390
Their type usually does, you know what I mean?

330
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,550
I know.

331
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,390
Well, guess you better get to class.

332
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,820
You don't want to be late.

333
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,390
If you're late, you'll think that Rudy and his pals

334
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:05,030
are a couple of creampuffs compared to Ms.

335
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,730
Titmarch when she gets sore.

336
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,130
I don't like her very much.

337
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,740
She's mean.

338
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,540
Well, just between you and me, Danny,

339
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,280
she is a bit of a sourpuss.

340
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,880
Well, guess you better get to class.

341
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,380
I've got to clean up the boys' room.

342
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,190
As a matter of fact, this whole place is in shambles.

343
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:31,560
Remember what I told you, anybody bothers you,

344
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,560
you come to me, OK?

345
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,790
OK.

346
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:36,860
Thanks, Mr. Jenkins.

347
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,260
See you later.

348
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,400
Bye.

349
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,070
See you later, alligator.

350
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,880
All right, people.

351
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,450
The bell has long since rung.

352
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:34,020
It's time for you to give me your undivided attention.

353
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,120
Good morning, class.

354
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,320
Good morning, Ms. Titmarch.

355
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,130
Very good.

356
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,430
Danny, you are late.

357
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,770
And since you are the last one in class,

358
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,070
you may hang up your coat and come up

359
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,940
here and pass out these papers.

360
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:08,990
Now today I have a little surprise.

361
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,460
Since so many of us don't seem to think that it's

362
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,890
necessary to turn in our math homework on time,

363
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,090
it's obvious to me that we all know everything

364
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,860
there is to know about math.

365
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,300
Sorry, could you get that for me?

366
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,200
So none of you will mind starting out

367
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:30,980
this morning with a little test, on our favorite subject,

368
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,210
fractions.

369
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:35,080
Now, I don't want to hear any talking.

370
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:43,090
You will have exactly 50 minutes to complete this test.

371
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,890
You may begin.

372
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,470
That's not funny, Rudy.

373
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,450
Ms. Titmarsh?

374
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:18,920
Ms. Titmarch?

375
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,050
What is it?

376
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,150
Can I go to the bathroom?

377
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,890
You should have gone before class.

378
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,490
But I didn't have to go then.

379
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,130
Have you finished your test?

380
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,730
Well, no, not yet.

381
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,230
Class, should we not Mr. Hollister

382
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:37,330
go to the little boy's room before finishing his test?

383
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,970
Forget it.

384
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,070
Let him wet his pants.

385
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,770
All right, go ahead.

386
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:44,710
Don't run.

387
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,720
Go.

388
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,620
Go.

389
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,600
Mr. Jenkins?

390
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,500
Mr. Jenkins?

391
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,770
Oh, sorry.

392
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:30,690
Hello?

393
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,120
You do it.

394
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,120
You do it.

395
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,130
You do it.

396
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,130
You do it.

397
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,130
No, you do it.

398
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,030
It's too ugly.

399
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,100
You do it.

400
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,700
You do it.

401
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,700
Oh, you.

402
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,670
No, you!

403
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,510
Ms. Titmarch, Ms. Titmarch, there's

404
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,910
a monster in the bathroom, monsters in the bathroom!

405
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:29,080
Quiet down.

406
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,050
This class is trying to concentrate.

407
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,520
What on earth are you talking about?

408
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,880
There's a monster in the bathroom.

409
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,450
I saw it!

410
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,420
Young man, you will stop this foolishness.

411
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,990
Now, sit down and finish your examination.

412
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:41,130
But--

413
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,530
I don't want to hear another word.

414
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,930
But--

415
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,460
You would fly to the moon and back if you thought you could

416
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,330
get out of taking an exam.

417
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:50,030
Hey, Danny, everything come out OK?

418
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:57,470
Oh, gross.

419
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,610
Mr. Hollister, you are disgraceful.

420
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:03,110
I have never met such a big baby.

421
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:05,080
You will go back to the bathroom immediately

422
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,280
and clean yourself up.

423
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,350
But there's a monster in the bathroom.

424
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:08,550
It'll get me!

425
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,290
I have had just about enough of this.

426
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:12,620
Now, you go back to the bathroom and clean yourself up

427
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,260
before I call your mother and tell her

428
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,260
you ought to be wearing diapers to school.

429
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,830
Now, go on.

430
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:19,530
Now!

431
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,610
Mr. Jenkins?

432
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,510
Mr. Jenkins!

433
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,370
It got Mr. Jenkins.

434
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,410
It killed him!

435
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:13,110
The monster killed Mr. Jenkins!

436
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:16,050
It pulled off his head!

437
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,580
Young man, that is done enough.

438
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,420
I have had it up to here with you.

439
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,320
You have tried my patience for the last time.

440
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,690
Class, you will continue with your test

441
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:28,190
while I escort Mr. Hollister to the lavatory.

442
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,860
But Ms. Titmarch--

443
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,260
Quiet!

444
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,460
Come with me.

445
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:38,070
Monsters and heads!

446
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:44,940
If you ever create a disturbance like that in my classroom

447
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,950
again, I'm going to see to it that you are severely punished.

448
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:50,610
Now we are going to go into the boy's room,

449
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:53,720
and then we are going to visit the principal.

450
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:57,450
But Ms. Titmarch, there's a monster in there, I swear!

451
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,020
And it got Mr. Jenkins.

452
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,020
All right.

453
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,990
Show me.

454
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:08,830
Now, where is this monster of yours?

455
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:12,640
Mhm.

456
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,640
And where is Mr. Jenkins?

457
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:18,940
In the sink in the supply closet.

458
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,350
Mhm.

459
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:22,550
We'll see.

460
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,960
This door is locked.

461
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,460
But there were keys in it, and I opened it--

462
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,860
And found Mr. Jenkins in the sink.

463
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,400
Now, I don't know what pleasure you get out of this,

464
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,630
but believe me, it is going to stop right now.

465
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,470
But he was in there!

466
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:46,770
You, Mr. Hollister,

467
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,610
are going with me to the principal's office.

468
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,410
And if I have anything to say about it,

469
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:53,210
you are going to be suspended indefinitely.

470
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:55,250
But he was in there, really!

471
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,750
And there was a monster in there.

472
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,160
Come here.

473
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,090
Come here!

474
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,440
Is that your monster?

475
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:21,000
That is just a bunch of protecto-sheets.

476
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:27,380
There is no monster in here, just vandalism.

477
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,720
You young people today, you have no sense of responsibility.

478
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,220
You just think because this is not your bathroom,

479
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,620
you can just come in and throw things right and left,

480
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,090
and somebody will come and clean up after you.

481
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:41,020
Where is Mr. Jenkins?

482
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,690
He should be cleaning up this mess, not me.

483
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:46,330
Dora Titmarch did not get a degree in education

484
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,100
to be cleaning up toilets!

485
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,930
Monster indeed!

486
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,700
You probably made this mess yourself!

487
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,610
Young man, when I am speaking to you, I want you to look at me.

488
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:59,110
What are you staring at?

489
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:01,480
No!

490
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,480
No!

491
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:16,290
Somebody help!

492
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:52,330
Hey, Danny, where's Ms. Titmarch?

493
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:54,700
Yeah, where is the old boob swamp?

494
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,930
A monster ate her.

495
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:56,830
What?

496
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:04,340
The same monster in the bathroom that ate Mr. Jenkins.

497
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,680
Hollister, you're either a first class liar

498
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,250
or you're crazy.

499
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,710
I think the little baby is just trying to get attention.

500
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,580
I say he's nuts.

501
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,820
So what is it, Hollister?

502
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,820
Why you making up such a stupid story.

503
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,150
You don't believe me?

504
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,190
Why don't you just go find out for yourself?

505
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:20,090
OK, we will.

506
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,020
Come on, guys.

507
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,500
So, what's this monster look like, Danny?

508
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,440
The werewolf, or Frankenstein, or is it more like a Martian?

509
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,170
Yeah, did it have antennas?

510
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:38,380
Maybe Danny just took a crap and thought it was a monster.

511
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,480
OK, guys, let's go and meet the mean and nasty monster.

512
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,150
That made little Danny piss his pants.

513
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,930
Hey, Mr. Monster.

514
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:58,530
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

515
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:00,730
Let's check this place out.

516
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:30,490
Hey, guys, there ain't nothin' in here.

517
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,100
What was that?

518
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,440
Let's get outta here!

519
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,410
There's something in the way.

520
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,860
Danny, let me out!

521
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,400
Please, the door is stuck!

522
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,800
Danny, help!

523
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,360
Danny help me.

524
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,740
No, no!

525
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:06,580
My god.

526
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,290
What the hell happened in here?

527
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,840
I don't want anyone in here.

528
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,450
Everyone stay out, please--

529
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:21,320
Ah!

530
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,220
After a few months,

531
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:51,820
he moved to another town and got a job at a different school.

532
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,030
Where do you work-a John,

533
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:58,960
on the Delaware-Lackawann.

534
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,530
And what do you do at dawn?

535
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:05,800
I push-a push-a--

536
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,310
--comes here.

537
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,280
Where?

538
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,210
Here.

539
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,950
Hot ginger and dynamite, that's all I do at night.

540
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,690
Back at Nagasaki, where the fellows chew tobaccy

541
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,460
in the land of Wicki-Wacki-Woo.

542
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,360
A fuggy am I, you get on my mind.

543
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:34,360
And then you-- hobbles and grease, dammit, kids.

544
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,300
God!

545
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,310
Mr. Jenkins, ah, Mr. Jenkins.

546
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:46,510
Oh, good, maybe you can help me. - Why not?

547
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:47,980
You're the principal.

548
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:52,750
Look, I know you've only worked here a week

549
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:54,650
and you're not really familiar yet with all the kids,

550
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:58,920
but we seem to have misplaced one of our students.

551
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,590
Ohh.

552
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:01,830
This is Mrs. Walters.

553
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,590
She's the president of our PTA.

554
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:07,160
Very happy to make your acquaintance, Mrs. Walters.

555
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,100
She was here to pick up her son, Jordan,

556
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,330
in the back parking lot.

557
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,040
When she got there, he wasn't around.

558
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,940
We've been looking all over for him with no luck.

559
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,840
I thought perhaps you've seen him.

560
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,170
I see lots of kids.

561
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:19,840
Jordy's about 4' 11".

562
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,580
He weighs 85 pounds.

563
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,650
Um. Let's see.

564
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:23,580
He has dark hair.

565
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,880
It's in a crew cut.

566
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,180
He's usually so reliable.

567
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,650
I can't think what could have happened to him.

568
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,150
Oh, let's see.

569
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,920
He was wearing jeans and a bright red, white, and blue

570
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,490
plaid final shirt.

571
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,330
Wait a minute.

572
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:40,030
I seen that kid this morning.

573
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:42,670
That kid's a bad apple, you know that?

574
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:43,970
Excuse me?

575
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:46,300
He was pushing around all the young kids.

576
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,140
He was trying to take away their lunch money, making

577
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,140
a nuisance out of himself.

578
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,180
Mr. Jenkins, I don't think this

579
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,350
is quite the time to get into this.

580
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:56,910
I think that kid of yours ought to be

581
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:59,950
taught a lesson, Mrs. Walters.

582
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,050
You must be mistaken.

583
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,190
My Jordy is a good boy.

584
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:05,420
I calls them as I sees them.

585
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,390
Well, have you seen Jordan recently?

586
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:11,290
Not since this morning, sir.

587
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:13,200
Well, if you do, you'll let me know immediately?

588
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,530
All right. Will do.

589
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,640
Come on, let's-- let's go to my office.

590
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,770
I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.

591
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,080
And they never, ever caught him.

592
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,110
He just keeps moving to different towns,

593
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,250
sometimes changing his identity.

594
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:05,820
And who knows.

595
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,880
He could even be working at one of your schools right now.

596
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,090
Wow, I wonder.

597
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:12,560
You know, Mr. Marsden in art class

598
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,560
always seemed a little weird to me.

599
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,230
That's 'cause he slipped in the shower

600
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:18,860
and bonked his head on the faucet over 20 years ago.

601
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,130
Oh.

602
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,870
Besides, Michael just made all that up.

603
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,170
I wish I did.

604
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:25,500
My dad told me that story, and it happened.

605
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,770
I swear to God.

606
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:28,640
How does Uncle Henry know all about this?

607
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,710
I told you.

608
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:31,240
He worked at the school where it happened.

609
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,780
And he knew this guy?

610
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,310
They were very close.

611
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,380
Yeah, well, whatever.

612
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,750
I think some of my fireflies are sick.

613
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:43,850
Told you you shouldn't have stuck 'em in that jar.

614
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,820
There's nothing wrong with them being in here.

615
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,220
Oh, I'm sorry.

616
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,290
Maybe it's just their batteries are running low.

617
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:50,960
They'll be fine.

618
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,660
Some of them are just sleeping.

619
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,460
Well, be careful with those things,

620
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,100
or you'll end up like Gordy Belcher.

621
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,430
No thanks.

622
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,370
Who's Gordy Belcher?

623
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:02,510
Whoa, you thought your story was strange?

624
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:05,070
Well, this one is even stranger.

625
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:06,340
What is it?

626
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,210
Well, Gordy Belcher was this kid that we

627
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:09,980
used to go to school with.

628
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,810
He had a rather odd hobby.

629
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:17,820
He also should have never gone near Old Farmer Spivey's place.

630
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,140
Gordy Belcher!

631
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,670
You lard ass.

632
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:51,210
What Sam hill you think you're doing on not my property?

633
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:53,980
None of your damn business, you old fart!

634
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,380
I've warned you before about what I do to little pests that

635
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,580
invade my garden.

636
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,950
I don't take kindly to rodents like you,

637
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:05,860
stealing my fertilizer and messing up my fence!

638
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,560
Well Well, yeah, I'm not the idiot

639
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:10,960
who just blew a hole in it.

640
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:13,560
Next time I catch you in here, I might just blow

641
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:16,330
a hole in you, make you 'member that

642
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:20,200
there Vietnamese boys' choir.

643
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,670
Use a gun and go to jail.

644
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:23,170
Why don't you mind your own business

645
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:25,170
and go back to your crappy job?

646
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:28,950
You just get out of here right now, before me and old Bessy

647
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:34,080
here decide to perform a little primitive weight reduction.

648
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,020
I said get!

649
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:51,570
Shit.

650
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,240
There you go.

651
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:28,170
Thank you.

652
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:37,580
Can I help you, Gordy?

653
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:44,990
Um, I'm sure.

654
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:47,620
I'll take one of these.

655
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,890
Is that all you need?

656
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:51,290
Yeah.

657
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:57,700
That'll be $0.10.

658
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,800
How about some asthma medicine today?

659
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,770
No thanks.

660
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:03,040
Bye.

661
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,900
Hi, kitty.

662
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,740
Nice kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

663
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,170
How you doin' kitty?

664
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,390
Nice kitty, kitty.

665
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:52,390
Woof!

666
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:53,290
Woof!

667
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:12,310
Disgusting!

668
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:13,310
Get it out of here!

669
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:15,310
It's disgusting!

670
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:18,920
Get this bug out of here!

671
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:23,890
All those bugs around me.

672
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:25,290
Help.

673
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:28,690
Lady!

674
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:29,690
Leave my bug alone.

675
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:30,890
That's expensive.

676
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:32,860
If you break it, I gotta pay for it.

677
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,060
You get that outta here!

678
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,430
Go on!

679
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:37,030
Look, now you wrecked it.

680
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:38,030
I'm gonna get fired.

681
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:40,000
I hope you do get fired!

682
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,130
Gordy, don't spend too much time down there.

683
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:19,530
Dinner's gonna be ready very soon.

684
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:26,800
It's your favorite, fried chicken.

685
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:27,940
Whatever.

686
00:56:45,290 --> 00:56:46,790
--Gordy, dinner's ready.

687
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,890
I'll be up in a little while.

688
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:53,030
Get up here now, Gordy.

689
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:53,960
You heard your mother.

690
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:56,270
You can finish whatever weird thing

691
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:58,570
you're doing down there later.

692
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:00,570
Did you hear me?

693
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:01,900
Yes.

694
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,840
Yes what? - Yes, sir.

695
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:06,810
I'm coming.

696
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:24,160
--Skeptical, but decided

697
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:26,630
to take a wait-and-see attitude for the time being.

698
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:27,560
Well--

699
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:28,660
No reading at the table, please.

700
00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:33,170
Wash your hands, please.

701
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:41,940
We'll talk more about that in a jiffy,

702
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,950
but first up, some community news.

703
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:46,520
The tri-county chapter of Kiwanis Club

704
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:48,420
is having a charity bowl-a-thon to help raise

705
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,420
money for a new youth center.

706
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:53,960
It starts Saturday at noon at the ..

707
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:54,920
All are welcome.

708
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,830
Gordy, how was school today?

709
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:01,760
Yeah, OK.

710
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:08,640
Mrs. Timmerman told me there's a school dance next week.

711
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:10,010
Are you gonna go?

712
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:13,280
Margaret, who the hell's gonna wanna dance with him?

713
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:14,980
Now, Ray, stop it.

714
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,350
I'm sure there are plenty of nice girls

715
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:18,610
who would love to dance with Gordy.

716
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:19,750
Aw, yeah.

717
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:21,780
And they're gonna crown him king of the ball.

718
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:22,950
Don't be mean.

719
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:24,990
Look, I'm not going to any stupid

720
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:29,560
dance with any stupid girls at some lame-o school thing, OK?

721
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:30,930
Oh no.

722
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:32,490
You just want to spend the evening

723
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:37,300
locked up in a dark basement playing with those stupid bugs.

724
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,570
Some sick kid you raised, Margaret.

725
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:41,870
Oh, so now it's all my fault. Well,

726
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:44,740
maybe if you'd spend some time with him every once in a while,

727
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:47,810
he wouldn't be so shy now.

728
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:49,240
Shy?

729
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:51,680
Is this what you call shy?

730
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:53,520
I call it pretty damn messed up in the head.

731
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:54,420
Shh.

732
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:55,420
Look.

733
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,450
That old fart Spivey's on television.

734
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:59,560
What's Old Man Spivey doing on TV?

735
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:02,620
Probably found a couple dead kids under his floorboards.

736
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,060
Ugh, Ray!

737
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,530
Shh!

738
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:07,100
Now people have been asking me what--

739
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,870
what that special secret ingredient is.

740
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:11,900
Well, I'm not tellin' nobody.

741
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,700
Many people dream of inventing something to make them rich.

742
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,740
One local man has come up with a revolutionary way to farm,

743
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,580
but he's not interested in selling.

744
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:24,080
Our KORN reporter Brock Richards went to find out why.

745
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:25,610
You say tomato.

746
00:59:25,710 --> 00:59:27,680
He says, tomato!

747
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:31,790
This is Brock Richards.

748
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:34,720
We're at the home of a local farmer Horace Spivey

749
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:38,330
to talk to him about a special fertilizer he's invented,

750
00:59:38,430 --> 00:59:42,200
a fertilizer that's the envy of all the county.

751
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:47,970
Farmer Spivey, tell us a little bit about your miracle manure.

752
00:59:48,070 --> 00:59:49,400
Well I--

753
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:53,110
I've been working on it, I'd say, oh, about 16 years.

754
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:58,850
And it came really into fruition about the last five or so.

755
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:03,220
And just to give you an example of what I'm talking about,

756
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,620
that there's a carrot.

757
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,720
You ever see a carrot like that before?

758
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:08,760
I can't say I have.

759
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:10,130
No, siree!

760
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:11,560
That's a big carrot.

761
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:16,200
And that's grown with Spivey's old miracle manure.

762
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:17,970
Yes, sir.

763
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:21,470
You know, Mr. Spivey, there's a lot of local farmers

764
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:23,510
in this county who would, well, give

765
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:26,780
their left arm to get a hold of a bag of your miracle manure.

766
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,910
I wonder, why is it you're not interested in selling

767
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:31,250
your fertilizer?

768
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:33,280
You could turn quite a tidy profit, I'm sure.

769
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:35,880
Well, yeah, but you see, money isn't everything.

770
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:39,220
And I decided that once I discovered this,

771
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,060
I better keep it to myself.

772
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:44,530
Because you don't know out there what they might put it to.

773
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:46,400
There's all kinds of applications

774
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:49,330
that it may have that we don't even know about.

775
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:51,670
And it could turn ugly.

776
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:55,300
So you see, I'd rather keep it to myself

777
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,010
and keep developing it.

778
01:00:57,110 --> 01:01:00,810
You see, I'd like to get a carrot as big as a man.

779
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:03,850
Now, can you imagine how many people that would feed, huh?

780
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:07,350
Well, I could imagine how many rabbits it would feel.

781
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:09,950
Well, all right.

782
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:11,920
Well, Mr. Spivey, I want to thank you for taking

783
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:15,060
the time to talk to us today. - My pleasure.

784
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,290
Thank you.

785
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:19,190
Well, this is quite a miracle manure,

786
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:22,530
as he calls it, a fertilizer the likes of which this reporter

787
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:23,970
has never seen before.

788
01:01:24,070 --> 01:01:25,270
And that's no bull.

789
01:01:25,370 --> 01:01:28,000
For KORN News, I brought Brock Richards.

790
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:32,410
Are we still rolling?

791
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:37,610
Thanks, Brock.

792
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:39,350
And be sure to check the bottom of your shoes

793
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:41,550
before you come back into the studio.

794
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:43,090
Well, that's it for the Evening Report.

795
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:45,490
Be sure to join us at 11:00 for Action News Night Side.

796
01:01:45,590 --> 01:01:48,590
Until then, I'm Kelly Appleton for KORN Action News.

797
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:49,860
Have a good evening.

798
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,730
The old geezer's nuts.

799
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:53,800
He's nuts for not selling that manure of his.

800
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:55,600
He'd laugh all the way to the bank.

801
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:57,500
I didn't know Old Man Spivey was up to anything

802
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:00,270
other than chasing people away from his property.

803
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:02,370
Well, you pass by his place on the way home from school,

804
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:03,540
don't you, Gordy?

805
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:04,940
Um, yeah, I guess.

806
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,110
Oh, did you know he was into all this?

807
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:09,210
How the heck would I know?

808
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:10,210
I'm just asking.

809
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:11,280
Sorry.

810
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:13,180
Yeah, how would Gordy know?

811
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,920
If it didn't have wings on it, he didn't care about it.

812
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,790
What?

813
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:56,020
What?

814
01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:00,130
Gordon Belcher, what in the hell are you doing?

815
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:01,560
What do you mean?

816
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:02,930
Gordy, I don't know how much more of this I

817
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:04,230
can take.

818
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:07,300
I mean, we have been very patient with you and your--

819
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:10,910
your-- hobby.

820
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:13,580
I mean, we keep thinking you're gonna grow out of all this,

821
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:16,750
but I don't see any signs of you changing.

822
01:03:16,850 --> 01:03:21,450
Other kids play baseball and go to school dances.

823
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:23,020
Other boys are interested in girls.

824
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:26,520
Hell, other kids even have some friends.

825
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:29,930
All you do is sit downstairs in the dark

826
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:33,930
and play with those filthy damn flies.

827
01:03:34,030 --> 01:03:37,000
Well, I didn't raise my son to be some kind of fruitcake.

828
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:40,400
From now on, this obsession of yours is gonna stop.

829
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,140
And that's it.

830
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,070
End of the argument.

831
01:03:50,810 --> 01:03:52,510
And what about this, Gordy?

832
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:57,790
Did you think this was funny, huh?

833
01:03:57,890 --> 01:04:01,860
Did you think I wouldn't notice these weren't raisins?

834
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:04,330
Well?

835
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:05,560
Gordon, your mother's talking to you.

836
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:07,160
I expect you to answer her.

837
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,060
I don't know.

838
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,000
What was that?

839
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,130
I don't know, OK?

840
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:12,270
I don't know.

841
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:13,500
Are you two through yet?

842
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,910
Sit down!

843
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:18,940
Aw, Dad!

844
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:20,480
We have more non-stop flights

845
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:23,210
from more destinations than any other airlines.

846
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:27,550
Now, I will tell you when to leave and when you are excused.

847
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:32,250
Until then, you sit here and eat your dinner.

848
01:04:32,350 --> 01:04:35,960
I just don't know what we're gonna do with you, Gordy.

849
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:37,290
I just don't know.

850
01:04:37,390 --> 01:04:38,630
Fly north, fly south.

851
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:41,260
But when you have to fly, fly with us.

852
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:12,760
Oh, man.

853
01:06:18,990 --> 01:06:20,500
Mike, you disgust me.

854
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,200
Sometimes I'm surprised we're related.

855
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:24,130
Well, Carol, I think you're old enough to know.

856
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:25,070
We're not.

857
01:06:25,170 --> 01:06:26,000
You're adopted.

858
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:30,740
Either way, you're still a pig.

859
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:33,610
Oh, relax. These flies aren't for me.

860
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:35,540
They're for Gordy Belcher.

861
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:41,820
It's a miracle, an agricultural breakthrough.

862
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:47,520
It'll put an end to world hunger and revolutionize the way we

863
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:48,820
farm.

864
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:51,030
Vegetables are only the beginning.

865
01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:55,630
There's no end to what you'll be able to do with Spivey's

866
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:59,330
own miracle manure!

867
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:06,370
As for you, Gordy Belcher, stay of my land!

868
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:10,380
What?

869
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:21,720
Oh my god.

870
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:33,300
That's what happens to things that go bad.

871
01:07:38,770 --> 01:07:40,280
Things that go bad!

872
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:44,280
Bad!

873
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:45,280
Bad!

874
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:46,280
Bad!

875
01:08:57,950 --> 01:09:00,460
That's what I'm telling her, you know?

876
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,640
Any of you guys want a cookie?

877
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:17,310
Uh, no thanks.

878
01:09:17,410 --> 01:09:18,140
They're homemade.

879
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:19,670
Uh, we gotta go, Jenny.

880
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:21,010
See you in Civics.

881
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:22,810
But lunch isn't over for another 20 minutes.

882
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:26,610
Uh, we told Ms. Dillon we would help her uh, uh--

883
01:09:26,710 --> 01:09:28,450
- Clean the blackboards. - Right.

884
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:29,450
Clean the blackboards.

885
01:09:29,550 --> 01:09:30,820
See ya.

886
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,820
Maybe we can find a place on the grass to eat.

887
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,460
Yeah, OK.

888
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:41,830
Look, I know you guys don't like me, big surprise.

889
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:43,770
Nobody likes me.

890
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:45,770
I mean, ever since elementary school,

891
01:09:45,870 --> 01:09:50,570
everybody said I was either too fat or too weird too mean.

892
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:52,170
The only reason why I'm never mean

893
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:55,510
is because nobody ever gives me the chance to be anything else.

894
01:09:55,610 --> 01:09:57,910
So if you don't want to sit with me, that's fine.

895
01:09:58,010 --> 01:09:59,180
You don't have to leave.

896
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,650
I'll go over and sit in the grass,

897
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:04,290
if I can find a place big enough.

898
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:05,950
Gordy, sit down.

899
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:07,390
You don't have to leave.

900
01:10:07,490 --> 01:10:08,520
You mean it?

901
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:09,960
Yeah, we mean it.

902
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:12,060
Thanks, guys.

903
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:13,660
Are you sure you don't want a cookie.

904
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:14,960
I made them myself.

905
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:17,200
OK, I'll have one.

906
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:18,170
Right here.

907
01:10:22,570 --> 01:10:24,870
Aren't you gonna taste it?

908
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:26,110
OK, I'll taste it.

909
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:53,300
Gordy Belcher, you are sick.

910
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:13,150
Go home, Gordy Belcher.

911
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:15,390
You've done enough damage for one day.

912
01:12:53,050 --> 01:12:55,790
Gordy Belcher, hold it right there.

913
01:12:55,890 --> 01:12:57,190
Why?

914
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:59,160
Is it too hard for you to shoot a moving target?

915
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:01,830
Now, I'm not gonna shoot anybody.

916
01:13:01,930 --> 01:13:03,400
I don't even have my gun with me.

917
01:13:06,930 --> 01:13:09,740
I suppose you're gonna want to invite me in for tea?

918
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,910
No.

919
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:17,980
No, I just want to take a look, see at your hand there.

920
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:21,020
Looks to me that it could be cut pretty bad.

921
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,150
No thanks.

922
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:24,490
I wouldn't want to get it infected.

923
01:13:24,590 --> 01:13:27,890
Gordy, what do you say we call a truce?

924
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:29,420
Huh?

925
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,690
I'm too old to be getting worked up over you all the time.

926
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:36,800
My doctor says it's-- it's not good for the old ticker.

927
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:42,000
So why don't you come on in here and let me clean up your hand?

928
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:43,600
I'll pass.

929
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:46,170
You'll pass out is what you'll do, from loss of blood

930
01:13:46,270 --> 01:13:48,340
by the time you get home.

931
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:49,110
Come on.

932
01:13:49,210 --> 01:13:50,950
It'll only take a minute.

933
01:13:51,050 --> 01:13:55,420
Besides, I got something for you in the woodshed here.

934
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:56,350
OK.

935
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:05,830
But if I'm not home soon, my parents are calling the police.

936
01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:09,560
If you're not home soon, you'll parents'll have a party.

937
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:19,010
This is where I mix all my fertilizer.

938
01:14:19,110 --> 01:14:22,210
Right here is where I first discovered

939
01:14:22,310 --> 01:14:25,010
my secret ingredient.

940
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:28,250
It's very impressive.

941
01:14:28,350 --> 01:14:29,880
Come on over here now.

942
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:34,090
Let me see that hand.

943
01:14:34,190 --> 01:14:35,020
Oh.

944
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:37,660
That's not so bad.

945
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:39,960
No, I don't see we're gonna to have amputate!

946
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:45,730
OK.

947
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:47,440
Let me put this on here.

948
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:50,170
That hurts, dammit!

949
01:14:50,270 --> 01:14:52,770
Oh, don't be such a baby!

950
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:54,180
Here.

951
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:56,680
Put the bandage on it, and then it'll be all done.

952
01:14:56,780 --> 01:14:58,010
Just hurry up.

953
01:14:58,110 --> 01:15:01,520
Here we go.

954
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:02,720
There!

955
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:04,590
There, all done.

956
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:05,920
Can I go now?

957
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:06,920
Yep, you're free to go.

958
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:08,820
Oh, wait a minute.

959
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:11,130
Don't forget this.

960
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:12,830
What's that?

961
01:15:12,930 --> 01:15:18,500
This is a jar of Spivey's old miracle manure.

962
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:21,270
Well, this batch is real different.

963
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:24,740
See, I mixed this up special just for you.

964
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:26,010
Yeah.

965
01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:30,040
I put in a few extra heapings of my secret ingredient.

966
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:36,880
So whatever you're using it for, it'll work extra good now.

967
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:39,720
Why are you doing all this?

968
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:43,560
Well, let's just say I hope that this token will

969
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:47,430
solve our differences, once and for all.

970
01:15:47,530 --> 01:15:50,700
And if I ever need to come back for more?

971
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:54,100
Oh, I don't think you'll be needing any more.

972
01:15:57,370 --> 01:15:59,810
Yeah, well, whatever.

973
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:00,740
I got to go.

974
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:17,560
Take care of that hand, now.

975
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:20,560
You never know what might happen.

976
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:21,500
Yeah, yeah.

977
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:17,050
Gordy, is that you?

978
01:17:17,150 --> 01:17:18,090
Uh-huh.

979
01:17:18,190 --> 01:17:19,190
You're home from school

980
01:17:19,290 --> 01:17:21,060
awfully early, aren't ya?

981
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:22,920
Yeah, I guess.

982
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:24,460
Well, why is that?

983
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,260
Um it was some sort of teacher's

984
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:28,030
conference day or something.

985
01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:29,260
It was a half day.

986
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:31,870
Funny, I didn't know about that.

987
01:17:31,970 --> 01:17:35,800
Usually I know when there's a teacher's conference day.

988
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:38,470
I thought I told you, but I guess I didn't.

989
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:39,910
Can I go upstairs now?

990
01:17:40,010 --> 01:17:41,310
Yes, you may.

991
01:17:41,410 --> 01:17:43,340
Oh, and by the way, you can just stay

992
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,680
up there too without supper.

993
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:47,620
Your principal called me this afternoon,

994
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:50,850
and I know all about what you did to that poor little girl.

995
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:52,250
Well, this is it.

996
01:17:52,350 --> 01:17:54,960
From now on, things are gonna be a lot different around here.

997
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:56,260
It was just a joke.

998
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:58,930
I mean, why is everybody getting so upset?

999
01:17:59,030 --> 01:18:00,430
Upset?

1000
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:03,600
Gordy, for God's sake, you made a girl eat dead flies.

1001
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:06,300
You got suspended from school.

1002
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,840
This weird obsession of yours has warped you.

1003
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:11,410
You don't even know what's right or wrong anymore.

1004
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:14,580
Well, it's over now.

1005
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:16,380
What's in the trash bag?

1006
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,650
Nothing that concerns you anymore.

1007
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:20,410
What's in the trash bag?

1008
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:22,420
Gordy, you go to your room right now.

1009
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:37,260
Gordy, get up here right now.

1010
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:40,000
There is nothing down there any more to concern yourself with.

1011
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:48,280
Gordy, do you hear me?

1012
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:51,050
You get up here and go to your room.

1013
01:18:51,150 --> 01:18:53,380
Your father is gonna want to have a word with you

1014
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:54,750
when he gets home.

1015
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:06,060
I hate you!

1016
01:19:28,350 --> 01:19:29,720
Wait a minute.

1017
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,890
She didn't know about you, now, did she?

1018
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:53,800
Don't worry.

1019
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:56,440
I'll get my stuff back, and then me and you

1020
01:20:56,540 --> 01:20:57,970
guys are gonna have some fun.

1021
01:21:53,130 --> 01:21:53,960
Who's there?

1022
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,090
Honey, honey.

1023
01:22:53,190 --> 01:22:54,150
What? What?

1024
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:55,090
What?

1025
01:22:55,190 --> 01:22:57,060
I heard something in Gordy's room.

1026
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:59,530
He's probably just going

1027
01:22:59,630 --> 01:23:01,530
to stuff his fat face again.

1028
01:23:01,630 --> 01:23:02,530
No.

1029
01:23:02,630 --> 01:23:03,760
No, no, it wasn't like that.

1030
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:06,300
I heard things falling. Come on.

1031
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:07,230
Come on.

1032
01:23:07,330 --> 01:23:08,270
Get up.

1033
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:10,540
Come on.

1034
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:11,510
All right.

1035
01:23:11,610 --> 01:23:12,440
God.

1036
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:33,490
Gordy, you in there?

1037
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:35,860
Everything OK, sweetheart?

1038
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:43,840
Gordy, what's wrong?

1039
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:47,570
Did you have a bad dream?

1040
01:23:47,670 --> 01:23:49,740
What in the hell's going on in here?

1041
01:23:54,210 --> 01:23:55,120
Oh my god.

1042
01:24:17,870 --> 01:24:22,440
I told him it was a special batch.

1043
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:08,090
After a while, Gordy stopped coming to school.

1044
01:25:08,190 --> 01:25:10,490
All the kids that he had been mean to before made fun of him

1045
01:25:10,590 --> 01:25:12,130
now.

1046
01:25:12,230 --> 01:25:15,600
I heard he went away to a special school somewhere.

1047
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:17,400
Anyway, you never see him anymore.

1048
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:20,070
A lot of the kids didn't believe the stories they heard.

1049
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:21,800
But everyone pretty much stays away from Old

1050
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:24,240
Man Spivey's place these days.

1051
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:25,440
Yeah.

1052
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:27,040
OK, I admit.

1053
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:30,280
That was a pretty good story, but come on guy, giant flies?

1054
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:31,310
Hey, it's true.

1055
01:25:31,410 --> 01:25:32,980
Don't believe it if you don't want to.

1056
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:35,880
But I knew Gordy Belcher, and I believe the stories.

1057
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:37,050
Me too.

1058
01:25:37,150 --> 01:25:38,750
Besides, we're supposed to believe

1059
01:25:38,850 --> 01:25:40,490
there was a janitor who pulled off

1060
01:25:40,590 --> 01:25:42,520
his face and the bratty kids?

1061
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:43,420
Well, that's true.

1062
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:44,590
You can ask my dad.

1063
01:25:44,690 --> 01:25:45,890
Yeah, right.

1064
01:25:45,990 --> 01:25:47,760
Hey, you little pipsqueak, you want to bet?

1065
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:49,060
No, I don't want to bet.

1066
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:51,470
Even if we did, how are you gonna prove it?

1067
01:25:51,570 --> 01:25:52,370
Well--

1068
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:53,930
Shh, guys, quiet!

1069
01:25:54,030 --> 01:25:56,200
Did you hear something? - No.

1070
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:57,000
Not me.

1071
01:25:57,100 --> 01:25:58,140
I think I heard something.

1072
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:00,210
It was probably just your stomach.

1073
01:26:00,310 --> 01:26:02,140
What do we have left to eat anyway?

1074
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,580
Yeah, I'm kinda hungry myself.

1075
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:04,510
There!

1076
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:05,880
Did you hear that?

1077
01:26:05,980 --> 01:26:06,910
What?

1078
01:26:07,010 --> 01:26:08,650
Are you just trying to scare us?

1079
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:09,680
No, no.

1080
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:10,720
I heard it that time too, Kyle.

1081
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:11,850
Shh.

1082
01:26:16,790 --> 01:26:18,160
Oh great, just what we need.

1083
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:19,490
Guys, look for the matches.

1084
01:26:19,590 --> 01:26:20,890
I'll try and light it again.

1085
01:26:20,990 --> 01:26:22,430
How are we supposed to look for the matches?

1086
01:26:22,530 --> 01:26:23,930
Well, well, feel around for 'em.

1087
01:26:24,030 --> 01:26:25,100
You know what I mean.

1088
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:26,700
Hey, I'm scared.

1089
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:28,200
Don't be such a baby.

1090
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:31,610
Beware of giant flies and janitors that eat children!

1091
01:26:31,710 --> 01:26:33,140
Blah!

1092
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:34,810
Hey, Josh, pass your jar of fireflies over here

1093
01:26:34,910 --> 01:26:36,580
so I can see what I'm doing.

1094
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:37,850
I don't see 'em.

1095
01:26:37,950 --> 01:26:39,910
Well, aren't they in your bag?

1096
01:26:40,010 --> 01:26:41,380
No, I left them out.

1097
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:42,180
Mm.

1098
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:43,450
I think maybe they're dead.

1099
01:26:43,550 --> 01:26:44,890
I told you they wouldn't make it.

1100
01:26:44,990 --> 01:26:45,820
Never mind.

1101
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:47,590
I found the matches.

1102
01:26:47,690 --> 01:26:49,820
I'm gonna stick you in a jar and see how you like it.

1103
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:50,760
KYLE: Ow!

1104
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:52,630
Ow! Oh, great.

1105
01:26:52,730 --> 01:26:54,230
I'm really scared, you guys.

1106
01:26:54,330 --> 01:26:55,500
Shut up.

1107
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,030
What's that?

1108
01:26:57,130 --> 01:26:58,430
Probably just my dad coming to check up on us.

1109
01:26:58,530 --> 01:27:00,400
Maybe he can help us get the lantern working.

1110
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:02,200
Quick, pretend like you're asleep.

1111
01:27:09,110 --> 01:27:10,940
You fellas all right out here?

1112
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:11,880
Fine, Uncle Henry.

1113
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:13,010
Great, just great.

1114
01:27:13,110 --> 01:27:14,550
Hey, we were just going to sleep.

1115
01:27:14,650 --> 01:27:16,520
You boys aren't out here giving each other the willies,

1116
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:17,420
are you?

1117
01:27:18,850 --> 01:27:20,750
I just told them what happened back at Greeley.

1118
01:27:20,850 --> 01:27:21,990
They didn't believe me.

1119
01:27:22,090 --> 01:27:23,890
Oh, they didn't, did they?

1120
01:27:23,990 --> 01:27:26,030
Yeah, we don't believe him.

1121
01:27:26,130 --> 01:27:28,600
That really didn't happen, did it, Uncle Henry?

1122
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:41,580
It really happened, all right.

1123
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:42,610
Every word of it.

1124
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:47,050
Prove it, Dad.

1125
01:27:47,150 --> 01:27:51,920
Yeah, prove it to us, Uncle Henry.

1126
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:53,520
You really think I should?

1127
01:27:56,590 --> 01:27:59,890
Go for it.

1128
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:01,090
All right.
