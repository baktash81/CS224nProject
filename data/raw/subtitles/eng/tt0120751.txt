1
00:02:20,396 --> 00:02:22,518
Jill, what did I tell you?

2
00:02:22,638 --> 00:02:26,670
- But Joe started it.
- It's not good for them to interact with us.

3
00:02:26,705 --> 00:02:28,914
Besides, that wasn't Joe,
that was Marley.

4
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:33,724
- No, it wasn't. It was Joe.
- Joe's just a baby, Jill.

5
00:02:33,844 --> 00:02:35,725
He's too big to be Joe.

6
00:02:35,845 --> 00:02:38,206
Check.
Check the pictures.

7
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,201
Hey, I said into bed.

8
00:03:37,361 --> 00:03:39,963
See? I am in bed.

9
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,924
Jill, what made you think...

10
00:03:42,044 --> 00:03:44,806
that that gorilla
we saw today was Joe?

11
00:03:44,926 --> 00:03:47,247
- I was right, wasn't I?
- Yeah.

12
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:50,969
My notes say that Joe
is only six months old.

13
00:03:51,089 --> 00:03:54,411
Either I got confused
or Joe is a very unusual gorilla.

14
00:03:54,531 --> 00:03:58,013
- I told you so.
- Yeah, you did.

15
00:03:58,133 --> 00:03:59,975
And Mommy's gonna write
in her journal...

16
00:04:00,095 --> 00:04:02,737
that my trusted colleague
Dr Jill Young...

17
00:04:02,857 --> 00:04:04,938
showed me the error of my ways.

18
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:09,540
Now, go to sleep.

19
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:15,464
~ Imba wimbo wa upepo ~

20
00:04:15,624 --> 00:04:18,786
~ Wakati unaji ~

21
00:04:18,906 --> 00:04:21,627
~ Wa na ~

22
00:04:21,787 --> 00:04:27,030
~ Imba wimbo wa upepo ~

23
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:31,433
~ Wakati unajiwa na ~

24
00:04:31,553 --> 00:04:35,115
Excuse me, Doctor.

25
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,476
- Night, Kweli.
- Good night, Jilly.

26
00:04:37,596 --> 00:04:40,879
- What is it, Kweli?
- You must come. Quickly.

27
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,041
Mommy, can I come?

28
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,522
Stay here, sweetheart.

29
00:04:49,324 --> 00:04:53,126
- I wanna go!
- No, no, no, no. You stay here, child.

30
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:02,091
- Poachers.
- East of the Village.

31
00:05:12,097 --> 00:05:14,298
N'Gai Zamu.

32
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:18,581
- N'Gai Zamu.
- N'Gai Zamu.

33
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:23,544
- They're at it again.
- N'Gai Zamu. Mystical monsters.

34
00:05:23,664 --> 00:05:27,066
There is only one thing you should
be afraid of on this mountain,

35
00:05:27,186 --> 00:05:30,588
and it's staring you
right in the face.

36
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:33,750
Gorilla. Fresh.

37
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,391
We're close.

38
00:05:53,161 --> 00:05:55,162
Gotta stop them.
Everybody spread out.

39
00:06:31,943 --> 00:06:34,665
- Get the baby.
- Give me the bag.

40
00:06:37,107 --> 00:06:40,349
Don't worry. We want you alive.

41
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,481
Garth!

42
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:05,283
Garth! Kill him!

43
00:07:05,403 --> 00:07:07,844
Joe!

44
00:07:10,766 --> 00:07:12,807
Give me that gun!

45
00:07:17,811 --> 00:07:20,693
Aaah!

46
00:07:29,618 --> 00:07:31,899
Joe?

47
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:34,180
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

48
00:07:36,942 --> 00:07:39,543
She's got to be here somewhere.

49
00:07:39,663 --> 00:07:42,585
The woman's got
that damn devil with her.

50
00:07:42,745 --> 00:07:44,946
But I think you
might have shot her.

51
00:07:45,186 --> 00:07:48,468
- These people
want to live like heroes.

52
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:51,190
Let them die like heroes. Oh!

53
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,831
Oh! That little demon...

54
00:07:53,951 --> 00:07:57,594
took off my thumb
and trigger finger.

55
00:07:57,714 --> 00:08:01,717
- Monstrule! Monstrule!
- What if you shot the woman?

56
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:04,958
- We should help her.
- No! Let's get out of here.

57
00:08:05,078 --> 00:08:08,040
Yeah. That looks bad. We better
get back before you bleed to death.

58
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,562
I will kill this
little monkey! I swear, I will kill him!

59
00:08:11,682 --> 00:08:13,603
You won't play
the violin again, that's for sure.

60
00:08:13,723 --> 00:08:15,924
Shut up!

61
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:27,891
Mommy!

62
00:08:28,051 --> 00:08:32,254
Mommy!

63
00:08:34,016 --> 00:08:38,538
- Mom, there were men and they-
- I know. I know.

64
00:08:38,658 --> 00:08:42,540
Are you okay, Mommy?

65
00:08:48,144 --> 00:08:51,145
Oh, look who's here.
Hello, Joe.

66
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:56,228
- He's scared.
- I know.

67
00:08:56,428 --> 00:09:00,951
Poor baby.
He lost his mommy tonight.

68
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:11,116
He needs someone to protect him.
Will you do that for me?

69
00:09:12,717 --> 00:09:14,639
Promise me you'll protect him.

70
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:18,922
I promise.

71
00:09:20,843 --> 00:09:23,244
Ah.

72
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:30,848
~ Wimbo wa upepo ~

73
00:09:30,968 --> 00:09:37,132
~ Wakati unajiwa na ~

74
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:40,254
~ Imbo wimbo ~

75
00:09:40,374 --> 00:09:42,815
~ Wa upepo ~

76
00:09:42,935 --> 00:09:49,659
~ Wakati ndoto tamu ~

77
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:56,264
~ Una endelea ~

78
00:09:56,384 --> 00:10:01,707
~ Milele ~

79
00:10:04,348 --> 00:10:07,150
~ Imbo wimbo ~

80
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,712
~ Wa upepo ~

81
00:10:10,872 --> 00:10:16,955

82
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:20,157

~ Wakati ndoto tamu ~

00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,966
~ Lala ~

86
00:10:34,086 --> 00:10:37,168
~ Mpaka usiku ~

87
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:39,449
Jill!

88
00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:41,130
Jill!

89
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:48,094
~ Upepo wa usiku ~

90
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:51,135
Come on, Joe.
Come on.

91
00:10:51,255 --> 00:10:56,779
~ Wimbo wako na ~

92
00:11:53,132 --> 00:11:56,974
- You must be Pindi.
- The one and only, bro.

93
00:11:57,094 --> 00:11:59,376
Come.

94
00:12:02,457 --> 00:12:07,020
Six men, three cars. That's everything
you asked for, Mr O'Hara.

95
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,582
All paid for in advance
out of Pindi's own pocket.

96
00:12:13,143 --> 00:12:15,144
These guys
wouldn't be poachers.

97
00:12:15,264 --> 00:12:19,187
I asked for experienced trackers.

98
00:12:19,307 --> 00:12:21,428
These men are the best.

99
00:12:21,588 --> 00:12:24,910
I assure you,
the very best.

100
00:12:26,271 --> 00:12:29,153
Let's get this show
on the road.

101
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:34,636
Hey, you've got
a nice piece here.

102
00:12:34,756 --> 00:12:37,358
- What are we hunting, elephants?
- We're not hunting anything.

103
00:12:37,438 --> 00:12:39,799
A- ha!
Tranquillizer darts.

104
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,081
I agree, much nicer
to animals than bullets.

105
00:12:42,201 --> 00:12:44,882
- Your men know how to use these, right?
- Oh, sure, boss.

106
00:12:45,002 --> 00:12:48,124
We only have professionals here.

107
00:12:48,244 --> 00:12:50,445
So, you tell me.
Where are we going today?

108
00:12:53,727 --> 00:12:55,608
There.

109
00:12:55,768 --> 00:12:57,809
There?

110
00:13:00,491 --> 00:13:02,492
That's not such
a good mountain, boss.

111
00:13:02,612 --> 00:13:04,613
The men don't like it very much at all.
You see there is...

112
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:07,575
- a legend they believe in, that a creature lives there.
- N'Gai Zamu.

113
00:13:07,695 --> 00:13:10,137
Sacred guardian of Mount Pangani.

114
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:15,740
They say any man who enters his domain
is never heard of again.

115
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,822
You know it.

116
00:13:17,982 --> 00:13:21,103
How strange.

117
00:13:21,223 --> 00:13:24,505
That's not by any chance
what you're looking for, is it, boss?

118
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:27,147
Looking for a legend?

119
00:13:27,267 --> 00:13:29,668
Why would I
want to do that?

120
00:13:53,202 --> 00:13:55,043
What are you listening to?

121
00:13:55,203 --> 00:13:57,085
Sounds.

122
00:13:57,205 --> 00:14:01,247
Hmm. I understand.
Songs of the jungle.

123
00:14:03,248 --> 00:14:06,490
I know a guy. He can get you
a CD of jungle sounds cheap.

124
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,491
Even cheaper if you-

125
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:11,773
Come on. Come on, let's go.

126
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:27,222
- See, boss, I told you
these men were the best.

127
00:14:27,342 --> 00:14:29,464
Oh.

128
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:35,187
You're a beauty.

129
00:14:49,115 --> 00:14:52,036
Okay.
Set him free.

130
00:14:54,598 --> 00:14:56,999
Why bring a cage
if you're not keeping the animal?

131
00:14:57,119 --> 00:15:00,161
'Cause I'm only taking this.

132
00:15:00,281 --> 00:15:03,523
Yes. Yes, but...

133
00:15:03,683 --> 00:15:06,205
I know a guy in Botswana.

134
00:15:06,325 --> 00:15:09,687
He'd pay you 10,000 American dollars
for that leopard.

135
00:15:09,807 --> 00:15:12,769
Now, I'm willing to split
with you 50-50.

136
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:14,770
Put him in the truck.

137
00:15:16,211 --> 00:15:18,132
Put the cat down now!

138
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:22,494
You heard him! Put the cat down!

139
00:15:26,977 --> 00:15:29,418
They never understand me.

140
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,772
Excuse me, but I think
it's time to leave.

141
00:16:26,892 --> 00:16:30,254
- Don't move!
- I'm not moving, but my bowels are.

142
00:16:30,374 --> 00:16:34,297
Don't run!
Stay still.

143
00:17:18,362 --> 00:17:20,804
Come on, he's gettin' away!

144
00:17:20,964 --> 00:17:24,686
- Come on, we're going after him!
- What do you mean, "we"?

145
00:17:24,806 --> 00:17:28,088
There's no way my men will risk
their lives with something like this.

146
00:17:28,168 --> 00:17:31,329
I'll triple your pay.

147
00:17:42,296 --> 00:17:45,018
Don't use the tranqs
unless I give the signal!

148
00:17:45,178 --> 00:17:49,541
Okay, when we catch up to him,
I want you men to herd him towards me!

149
00:17:49,661 --> 00:17:52,782
One second, one second.

150
00:17:52,903 --> 00:17:55,224
Herd him towards us?
Why?

151
00:17:55,344 --> 00:17:58,426
I gotta be close
to get a blood sample.

152
00:17:58,546 --> 00:18:00,347
Real close.

153
00:18:29,044 --> 00:18:31,285
No, no, don't shoot!

154
00:18:31,405 --> 00:18:34,407
No!

155
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,291
Whoa!

156
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,137
They'll live.

157
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,859
Bet you provide a great health plan.

158
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,782
Look at the way he moves.

159
00:19:00,902 --> 00:19:03,184
Magnificent.

160
00:19:03,344 --> 00:19:05,585
Watch out!

161
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:13,790
You stupid fool!

162
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,511
Come on, we're gonna lose him!
Come on, let's go!

163
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,557
What the hell is that guy
trying to do?

164
00:19:29,078 --> 00:19:30,759
Hey! Hey!

165
00:20:11,783 --> 00:20:14,025
I can't see him.
He's gone, long gone.

166
00:20:14,145 --> 00:20:17,587
No, he's coming out on the other side of
those trees. We gotta get in front of him.

167
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:28,514
There he is!

168
00:20:33,236 --> 00:20:34,917
What's he-

169
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,562
Get down!

170
00:21:39,636 --> 00:21:43,158
Did you see that?
Did you see what he did?

171
00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:45,319
Yes.
Yes.

172
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:47,760
Picked up the chain.
Did you see the intelligence?

173
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,801
Yes, I saw the intelligence.

174
00:21:49,961 --> 00:21:51,842
He almost took my head off!

175
00:21:59,006 --> 00:22:03,969
- Hurry up, bro. Let's go.
- Get these men down the mountain and bandaged up.

176
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,571
- You're not coming with us?
- Are you kidding?

177
00:22:06,691 --> 00:22:08,812
Crazy American.

178
00:22:08,932 --> 00:22:10,973
Okay!

179
00:23:22,415 --> 00:23:24,256
Joe! Joe!

180
00:23:24,376 --> 00:23:27,138
No!

181
00:23:29,939 --> 00:23:32,621
Joe, stop!

182
00:23:34,782 --> 00:23:37,264
Hey, can you get him
to put me down?

183
00:23:40,226 --> 00:23:41,307
- Joe, drop him.

184
00:23:57,236 --> 00:24:00,197
- Where am I?
- The infirmary.

185
00:24:00,317 --> 00:24:02,318
You've been unconscious
for an entire night.

186
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:04,680
You're lucky to be alive.

187
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,641
I don't feel very lucky.

188
00:24:06,761 --> 00:24:09,963
You crashed your vehicle.
It's waiting for you outside.

189
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:12,204
You're an injury behind.

190
00:24:14,045 --> 00:24:17,168
The kicker was getting dropped
on my head by N'Gai Zamu.

191
00:24:17,288 --> 00:24:20,129
Oh, you think that's funny?

192
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:24,932
- You oughta try it.
- N'Gai Zamu is just a legend, my friend.

193
00:24:25,092 --> 00:24:28,294
No, he's a giant gorilla
with a mean backhand.

194
00:24:30,455 --> 00:24:33,937
- Wait. There was a woman.
- A woman?

195
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:37,419
Out in the jungle, a beautiful woman.
She saved my life.

196
00:24:37,499 --> 00:24:40,301
I think it would be wise for you
to see a doctor in Kimanjay.

197
00:24:40,501 --> 00:24:42,862
I took the liberty
of calling one for you.

198
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,784
- Don't need one.
- But he's expecting you.

199
00:24:45,904 --> 00:24:48,785
If you can drive,
I think it's best that you leave today.

200
00:25:20,404 --> 00:25:22,806
Our visitor must be feeling better.

201
00:25:22,926 --> 00:25:25,247
Should leave the infirmary by today.

202
00:25:26,327 --> 00:25:28,889
Looks like he already has.

203
00:25:29,009 --> 00:25:33,291
He's walking so soon?
Joe should've dropped him harder.

204
00:25:33,411 --> 00:25:36,534
He's not a poacher, Jill.

205
00:25:36,654 --> 00:25:40,176
The man works for animal conservancy
in California.

206
00:25:42,938 --> 00:25:45,099
He can't be trusted.
He's an outsider.

207
00:25:58,026 --> 00:26:00,548
He said he was saved
yesterday by-

208
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:02,589
by a woman.

209
00:26:02,709 --> 00:26:05,991
A beautiful woman.

210
00:26:10,273 --> 00:26:14,476
- And what did you tell him?
- What can I tell him, Jill?

211
00:26:14,597 --> 00:26:19,159
The man knows what he saw.
He's not a fool.

212
00:27:55,135 --> 00:27:57,696
Hey, big guy.

213
00:27:57,856 --> 00:27:59,737
How are ya? Hmm?

214
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,621
What were you doin', stompin' around
and lookin' for trouble yesterday, huh?

215
00:28:06,741 --> 00:28:10,183
You're not supposed to
let people see you, remember?

216
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:16,468
Don't do that again, okay?
Please.

217
00:28:16,548 --> 00:28:21,070
Please.

218
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:25,273
You wanna play?

219
00:28:25,393 --> 00:28:30,476
Okay. You ready?

220
00:28:30,596 --> 00:28:35,518
One, two,

221
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,520
three,

222
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,402
four, five,

223
00:28:41,522 --> 00:28:44,764
six, seven, eight, nine,

224
00:28:44,884 --> 00:28:46,845
ten!

225
00:28:47,965 --> 00:28:49,886
Ready or not,
here I come!

226
00:28:53,329 --> 00:28:56,611
Joe!

227
00:28:56,731 --> 00:28:59,093
Where are you, big fella?

228
00:28:59,213 --> 00:29:01,094
Coming to get you!

229
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:07,417
Oh, my!

230
00:29:07,577 --> 00:29:10,019
I wonder where Joe can be.

231
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,461
Come out wherever you are.

232
00:29:14,621 --> 00:29:17,263
I found you!

233
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:20,305
Yes, yes I did.

234
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:24,547
Yeah.
Trying to hide from me.

235
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,792
You wanna come and find me?
Okay.

236
00:29:32,913 --> 00:29:35,034
Close your eyes.

237
00:29:36,114 --> 00:29:39,196
Ready? Go!

238
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:24,823
Come on, Joe.

239
00:30:33,347 --> 00:30:35,589
Nice monkey.

240
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,990
Joe.

241
00:30:43,673 --> 00:30:45,794
Joe, it's okay!

242
00:30:45,914 --> 00:30:48,036
Joe, run!
Get out of here!

243
00:30:58,763 --> 00:31:01,124
Thanks.

244
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:04,366
Hide and seek's
not really my game.

245
00:31:04,486 --> 00:31:06,407
Anything broken?

246
00:31:08,608 --> 00:31:11,330
No. No, I think I'm-

247
00:31:13,411 --> 00:31:15,452
- I think it's okay.
- Oh, good.

248
00:31:15,532 --> 00:31:17,893
- I think it's still working.
- Oh, great.

249
00:31:18,013 --> 00:31:20,135
- I can fix that for you.
- No, wait!

250
00:31:21,615 --> 00:31:23,496
Hey, w-where are you going?

251
00:31:23,617 --> 00:31:25,818
Wait, wait,
wait a minute!

252
00:31:25,938 --> 00:31:28,100
Hey, hold on a second.
What's the problem?

253
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,101
You.
You're the problem.

254
00:31:30,261 --> 00:31:32,062
This is the second time I've saved you
from being killed.

255
00:31:32,222 --> 00:31:34,424
Next time I'm just gonna watch,
you understand?

256
00:31:34,544 --> 00:31:36,505
Okay, all right.

257
00:31:36,665 --> 00:31:40,307
You saved me, and I'm grateful.
Thank you, Miss Young.

258
00:31:40,467 --> 00:31:43,349
I know who you are.
You're Ruth Young's daughter.

259
00:31:43,429 --> 00:31:45,470
Did she know about Joe?
Did she have a theory on him?

260
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:48,151
How did you keep him a secret
all these years?

261
00:31:48,271 --> 00:31:50,393
By keeping people like you
off this mountain.

262
00:31:50,513 --> 00:31:53,114
People like me?
I- I wanna help you.

263
00:31:53,234 --> 00:31:56,356
You go back to where you came from
and tell them what you saw,

264
00:31:56,436 --> 00:31:58,837
this place will be
crawling with people.

265
00:31:58,957 --> 00:32:00,798
That's gonna happen anyway.

266
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:02,799
Look, I'm not the only one
who saw him.

267
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,441
An animal as rare as Joe
means big money.

268
00:32:05,561 --> 00:32:08,564
It's going to be tough trying to protect
him here. Maybe impossible.

269
00:32:08,724 --> 00:32:11,485
Here is where he lives.

270
00:32:11,605 --> 00:32:13,607
- He doesn't have a choice.
- That's not true.

271
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:18,049
The people I work for could take
care of Joe. They have the facilities.

272
00:32:18,209 --> 00:32:21,011
A cage?
That's just what Joe needs.

273
00:32:21,131 --> 00:32:23,252
No, no, not a cage, a preserve.

274
00:32:23,412 --> 00:32:26,654
A place where he'll be free,
free from poachers, land developers.

275
00:32:26,814 --> 00:32:30,776
- A place he'll be safe.
- But he won't be free.

276
00:32:30,936 --> 00:32:33,578
How long do you think
he can stay free here?

277
00:32:33,698 --> 00:32:38,581
The next people who come are gonna be
coming to hunt Joe down.

278
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:49,388
Quite an impressive facility
you have here, Mr Strasser.

279
00:32:49,508 --> 00:32:51,869
- Thank you.
- Tell me, why is it...

280
00:32:51,989 --> 00:32:55,671
that you keep such a low profile
about this wonderful place?

281
00:32:55,871 --> 00:33:00,034
Our only interest is the well-being
of our animals.

282
00:33:00,194 --> 00:33:04,636
Well, I think I've come
to the right place for Morris.

283
00:33:04,756 --> 00:33:07,598
I'm sure you have.

284
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:12,040
He's grown out
of his habitat, and-

285
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,082
well, our zoo just doesn't have
the budget to do anything about it.

286
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:17,763
That's why he needs
a new home.

287
00:33:17,884 --> 00:33:20,725
That's the telephone for you,
Mr Strasser. It's urgent.

288
00:33:20,885 --> 00:33:23,006
Will you excuse me,
Mr Anderson?

289
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,968
- Sure.
- I'll be back.

290
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,693
Garth, see what the market is...

291
00:33:32,813 --> 00:33:35,094
for the organs of this lovely panda.

292
00:33:35,214 --> 00:33:37,896
- Ooh, big fella. We should get a lot.
- Strasser.

293
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,937
It's about time.
Do you know how long I've been waiting?

294
00:33:41,138 --> 00:33:43,219
What do you want, Pindi?

295
00:33:43,339 --> 00:33:46,060
Not what I want, boss,
what you want.

296
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,302
How about a giant gorilla?

297
00:33:48,382 --> 00:33:51,904
- Talk.
- As big as three men.

298
00:33:52,024 --> 00:33:55,786
- 2,000 pounds at least.
- You've been drinking, haven't you?

299
00:33:55,906 --> 00:33:57,907
I swear to God, boss.

300
00:33:58,067 --> 00:34:01,389
I saw him with my own two eyes.
He's- He's huge!

301
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:04,311
Don't waste my time, Pindi.

302
00:34:04,431 --> 00:34:08,394
- Hello? Boss?
- 2,000 pound gorilla.

303
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:10,755
He's crazy.

304
00:34:30,886 --> 00:34:32,928
Stupid girl!
What do you think you are doing?

305
00:34:33,128 --> 00:34:36,009
- Huh?
- I found this in the forest this morning.

306
00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:39,131
Thought maybe you dropped it
and might want it back!

307
00:34:39,251 --> 00:34:42,093
Poaching's illegal.
Get off this mountain.

308
00:34:44,575 --> 00:34:46,496
Jill.

309
00:34:46,616 --> 00:34:48,938
Jill, I need to talk to you.
Jill!

310
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,021
- Murderer.
- Yeah.

311
00:35:16,793 --> 00:35:20,115
Your mother slept in this bed.
She worked at this desk.

312
00:35:20,235 --> 00:35:23,878
She died in this jungle. Do you plan
to do everything just like her?

313
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:26,319
My mother would have been proud
of what I did today.

314
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,081
Proud?
Of this foolishness out there?

315
00:35:29,241 --> 00:35:30,922
Proud of you risking your life?

316
00:35:31,082 --> 00:35:34,844
She risked hers.
Why shouldn't I risk mine?

317
00:35:34,964 --> 00:35:39,047
I'm just trying to keep a promise here.
I promised to take care of Joe.

318
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:41,968
I will do everything it takes
to stop those poachers.

319
00:35:42,088 --> 00:35:46,691
You cannot stop them.
Even she could not stop them.

320
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:51,614
The other gorillas,
they have moved south to safer lands.

321
00:35:51,734 --> 00:35:55,336
- Joe stays behind.
- They won't accept him.

322
00:35:55,496 --> 00:35:57,457
Joe needs me.

323
00:36:00,819 --> 00:36:03,781
The danger here is building
for both of you.

324
00:36:03,902 --> 00:36:07,183
I feel it, and so do you.

325
00:36:08,904 --> 00:36:11,906
I know what the American
is offering, Jill.

326
00:36:12,066 --> 00:36:15,828
Consider it.
That's all I ask.

327
00:37:02,495 --> 00:37:06,137
- Leaving?
- Yeah, I'm heading up into the mountains.

328
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:09,819
See if I can throw some
of those dirtbags off Joe's trail.

329
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,781
Think it will work?

330
00:37:11,901 --> 00:37:14,422
Not for long.
I'm just trying to buy you some time.

331
00:37:14,542 --> 00:37:17,704
I suggest you get Joe
as deep into the jungle as you can,

332
00:37:17,824 --> 00:37:19,665
as fast as you can.

333
00:37:22,588 --> 00:37:24,349
- Okay.
- Okay what?

334
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:26,430
Okay, we'll go with you.

335
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:29,672
- We?
- Me and Joe.

336
00:37:29,832 --> 00:37:32,673
We'll go with you to that place
of yours in California.

337
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:36,235
- You sure about this?
- No, I'm absolutely not sure about this.

338
00:37:36,355 --> 00:37:38,917
- But I'll do this on one condition.
- Name it.

339
00:37:39,037 --> 00:37:41,038
- I'm in charge of Joe.
- Done.

340
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:42,799
- Done?
- Done.

341
00:37:42,919 --> 00:37:44,880
- Just like that?
- Just-

342
00:37:47,121 --> 00:37:49,563
- You're not very trusting, are you?
- No, I'm not.

343
00:37:49,683 --> 00:37:52,724
It must be tough for you then,
trying to measure me up.

344
00:37:52,885 --> 00:37:56,206
- Trying to decide if I'm full
of it or- - Or just a fool.

345
00:37:56,326 --> 00:37:59,688
I guess we'll just have to
figure it out as we go along.

346
00:37:59,888 --> 00:38:03,612
Look, what do you want me to say?
You'll be in charge of Joe, okay?

347
00:38:05,853 --> 00:38:08,414
Come on.
We'll shake on it.

348
00:38:08,534 --> 00:38:11,056
I don't shake.

349
00:38:11,176 --> 00:38:13,177
That's not how
we make pacts around here.

350
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:16,539
All right, how do you
make pacts around here?

351
00:38:16,659 --> 00:38:19,180
You have to endure a bite
from a Makiki spider.

352
00:38:20,461 --> 00:38:23,303
- A what?
- You'll have a high fever, hallucinations.

353
00:38:23,383 --> 00:38:27,145
You'll say things, lots of things.
I'll hear what's in your heart.

354
00:38:27,265 --> 00:38:31,467
Then, if your intentions prove true,
then we have a pact.

355
00:38:31,547 --> 00:38:36,470
- A spider bite and hallucinations?
- That's right.

356
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:40,113
Then you'll trust me to take
you and Joe to California with me?

357
00:38:40,273 --> 00:38:42,554
Absolutely.

358
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:46,957
Well? What do you say?

359
00:38:48,558 --> 00:38:52,200
I say that's the biggest load of crap
I ever heard in my whole life.

360
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:56,522
Maybe you're not a fool after all.

361
00:39:02,526 --> 00:39:05,447
Get your things together fast.

362
00:39:05,647 --> 00:39:08,689
We're gettin' outta here
as soon as we can.

363
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:13,292
Makiki spider.

364
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:46,231
I don't know what else to do, Joe.

365
00:39:47,912 --> 00:39:49,833
I just want you to be safe.

366
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,903
You think he's okay back there?

367
00:40:39,023 --> 00:40:41,264
- He's doing fine.
- Okay.

368
00:40:42,865 --> 00:40:45,106
I'm sorry.
I'm just a little tense.

369
00:40:49,789 --> 00:40:52,390
You think he's okay back there?

370
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:54,471
- I think he's okay back there.
- Good.

371
00:40:55,752 --> 00:40:58,674
So, this is L.A., huh?

372
00:40:58,834 --> 00:41:01,675
- Everything looks the same. How do you know where you are?
- It's easy.

373
00:41:01,795 --> 00:41:04,637
Ocean's that way, the mountains
are that way, Mexico's that way,

374
00:41:04,757 --> 00:41:06,598
and Canada's that-a-way.

375
00:41:06,758 --> 00:41:10,200
Don't worry about the rest.
You'll never see it through the smog.

376
00:41:12,361 --> 00:41:15,203
Maybe you better check and see
if Joe's okay back there.

377
00:41:52,465 --> 00:41:54,186
Mom! M-Mom!

378
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,401
Main gate to Dr Banks.
They're pulling up now.

379
00:42:20,601 --> 00:42:22,442
I copy that.

380
00:42:22,563 --> 00:42:26,365
Okay, everybody,
Elvis is in the building!

381
00:42:38,292 --> 00:42:40,894
- He's big!
- Did you see him?

382
00:42:41,014 --> 00:42:42,975
The fun begins.

383
00:42:43,135 --> 00:42:46,137
You hear that, Harry? They smell him.

384
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:48,858
Who, Gregg or the gorilla?

385
00:42:54,622 --> 00:42:56,583
All right.
I'm a little confused, O'Hara,

386
00:42:56,663 --> 00:43:00,225
because you phoned us to say you're
bringing back a 2,000-pound wild animal-

387
00:43:00,345 --> 00:43:02,386
- Hello, Harry. Hiya, gorgeous.
- Welcome back, Gregg.

388
00:43:02,506 --> 00:43:04,867
But security tells me you requested no
fire hoses and no restraints of any kind.

389
00:43:04,987 --> 00:43:07,549
- Come on, let me introduce you.
- Well, how are we supposed to control this animal?

390
00:43:07,629 --> 00:43:10,350
- With a giant rolled-up newspaper? Hi.
- Jill Young, I'd like you...

391
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:12,311
to meet Dr Harry Ruben,
who runs the place.

392
00:43:12,472 --> 00:43:15,114
- Nice to meet you.
- And Dr Cecily Banks,

393
00:43:15,234 --> 00:43:17,916
- who makes sure he doesn't screw it up.
- Nice to meet you both.

394
00:43:21,558 --> 00:43:23,399
Hold on, big guy.
I'm comin'.

395
00:43:28,001 --> 00:43:29,842
I think he's ready to come out.

396
00:43:29,962 --> 00:43:32,604
Harry, I think it's time
you met Joe.

397
00:43:35,645 --> 00:43:38,207
I know it looks small,
but this is just the entrance.

398
00:43:38,327 --> 00:43:40,648
- He has the entire hill to roam.
- Okay.

399
00:43:40,808 --> 00:43:43,490
Jack, Vern, are we gonna have to
hose you guys down too?

400
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:45,891
- Come on, get the sedatives ready.
- No, no, no.

401
00:43:46,011 --> 00:43:49,133
- We don't need any of that.
- Don't worry. We know what we're doing here.

402
00:43:49,253 --> 00:43:52,055
Hey, whoa, hold on.
Harry, we had an agreement.

403
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:54,737
- The lady's in charge of Joe.
- How is she gonna handle-

404
00:43:54,857 --> 00:43:57,699
Easy, tiger. Come on.

405
00:43:57,819 --> 00:44:00,500
Calm down. Calm-

406
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,782
Okay, guys. I got it.
All right.

407
00:44:02,902 --> 00:44:05,023
You sure you got everything
under control?

408
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:06,704
Yeah.

409
00:44:06,824 --> 00:44:08,905
Come on.

410
00:44:09,025 --> 00:44:11,627
- You sure she knows what she's doing?
- She knows.

411
00:44:11,787 --> 00:44:14,989
You want me to come in there
and get you?

412
00:44:15,109 --> 00:44:16,990
There you go.

413
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:19,471
Come on.
Come look at your new home.

414
00:44:19,591 --> 00:44:24,594
Come on. There you go.

415
00:44:32,358 --> 00:44:35,401
Come on, Joe.
Come on.

416
00:44:35,521 --> 00:44:37,402
Come on.

417
00:44:48,288 --> 00:44:51,170
Vern, what am I paying
you for? Get some pictures.

418
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:55,972
- All right.
- And get me in there, too. You know, for perspective.

419
00:45:03,737 --> 00:45:06,338
Okay. It's okay, Joe.

420
00:45:07,899 --> 00:45:12,061
Hey. Hey, Joe.
Come on. Nothing happened.

421
00:45:12,182 --> 00:45:14,704
You're not scared
of those people are you?

422
00:45:14,864 --> 00:45:19,347
I promise nothing
will happen to you, okay?

423
00:45:19,507 --> 00:45:22,909
- Come on, Joe.
- Come on, Joe. Come on.

424
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:29,832
There you go.
Yeah, you big guy.

425
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:31,834
Come on, Joe.

426
00:45:33,394 --> 00:45:36,036
There you go.
Come on, big guy.

427
00:45:36,276 --> 00:45:38,037
Come on.

428
00:45:50,884 --> 00:45:53,727
- I think he's gonna be fine.
- I'm glad.

429
00:45:53,847 --> 00:45:55,768
Let's move
that platform out of there.

430
00:45:55,928 --> 00:45:58,249
- Oh, no, I'm going back in there with him.
- No, I'm sorry.

431
00:45:58,369 --> 00:46:00,531
We can't allow that. We don't have insurance
to cover anyone who's not an employee.

432
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:02,612
You're not serious.

433
00:46:02,732 --> 00:46:05,173
- But I'm supposed to be in charge of Joe.
- Yes, you are.

434
00:46:05,253 --> 00:46:07,495
And I'm in charge of this facility.

435
00:46:07,655 --> 00:46:09,616
Let's go! Take it up.

436
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:16,019
Okay, swing it up!

437
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:19,461
"And I'm in charge of this facility. "

438
00:46:19,621 --> 00:46:21,462
I mean, who does he think he is?

439
00:46:21,582 --> 00:46:25,224
I bet that man has never spent
one night outside in his entire life.

440
00:46:25,345 --> 00:46:30,107
Probably not. Well, here are
your new, deluxe accommodations.

441
00:46:30,227 --> 00:46:33,670
I should be out there with Joe,
not here. Not in this-

442
00:46:35,351 --> 00:46:37,272
this cage.

443
00:46:37,392 --> 00:46:39,553
Look, I know how you feel.

444
00:46:39,674 --> 00:46:42,595
It's not exactly my idea
of "home, sweet home" either,

445
00:46:42,715 --> 00:46:45,037
but at least you're close to Joe.

446
00:47:47,673 --> 00:47:49,554
Where's Gregg?

447
00:47:49,674 --> 00:47:52,516
Talk to you later. I don't know.
He collected his paycheck.

448
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:55,758
He's probably in some jungle by now,
looking for giant sheep.

449
00:47:55,878 --> 00:47:59,200
Well, I think he should be here.
This is his discovery.

450
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:02,242
Excuse me.
Gregg's expertise is crashing Humvees.

451
00:48:02,362 --> 00:48:06,164
It's not explaining primate behaviour to
the chairman of the conservancy board.

452
00:48:06,284 --> 00:48:09,046
You know what I think, Harry?
I think you're jealous.

453
00:48:09,166 --> 00:48:11,447
I'm crippled with envy, yes.

454
00:48:11,567 --> 00:48:15,969
Just once I wanted to go into the field
and find a new species.

455
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:18,091
You know, anything.
A mollusc.

456
00:48:18,211 --> 00:48:20,052
Here we go.

457
00:48:20,132 --> 00:48:22,973
- Harry. Dr Banks.
- Hi.

458
00:48:23,093 --> 00:48:24,894
So, let's go see him.

459
00:48:25,015 --> 00:48:27,696
See, the gorillas in the Pangani
carry this recessive gene...

460
00:48:27,856 --> 00:48:31,899
that pops up every four or five generations
with this rare form of gigantism.

461
00:48:32,019 --> 00:48:33,981
And that's where
the legend comes from.

462
00:48:34,101 --> 00:48:36,382
But I knew it was more
than a legend,

463
00:48:36,502 --> 00:48:38,463
so I followed my gut instinct.

464
00:48:38,623 --> 00:48:42,465
- I just had a hunch that this thing was true.
- Pretty damn sharp, Harry.

465
00:48:42,625 --> 00:48:44,987
All right, here we are.

466
00:48:47,548 --> 00:48:51,030
- Pretty cool, huh?
- My, my, I should say so.

467
00:48:54,232 --> 00:48:56,953
- Where is he?
- Um-

468
00:48:57,073 --> 00:48:59,555
Uh, Joe?

469
00:49:00,756 --> 00:49:02,837
Come here, Joe!

470
00:49:05,638 --> 00:49:07,759
Come here, boy.

471
00:49:09,842 --> 00:49:12,483
Gorillas. There's never one around
when you need 'em.

472
00:49:12,603 --> 00:49:16,165
- Even for the chairman of the board.
- Well, I came here to see him.

473
00:49:16,325 --> 00:49:19,447
You know what, maybe-
You know what, I'll feed him.

474
00:49:19,607 --> 00:49:21,448
- That'll get him to come out.
- Um, Harry-

475
00:49:21,568 --> 00:49:24,010
Don't worry.
I know what I'm doing.

476
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:27,411
Elliot, you stay here.
I'm gonna go open the gate.

477
00:49:27,532 --> 00:49:31,334
Silver, brown, blond, white. There are
nine different colours to choose from.

478
00:49:31,454 --> 00:49:35,656
Ron, you have to ask
things like toxicity. This is safe?

479
00:49:35,816 --> 00:49:37,737
This product has been tested
for ten years.

480
00:49:37,857 --> 00:49:41,179
It's not just a coloured spray,
like some of you might be thinking.

481
00:49:41,419 --> 00:49:43,581
It's just a plain, ordinary cosmetic.

482
00:49:43,741 --> 00:49:47,062
And it just washes out in the evening.

483
00:49:57,709 --> 00:49:59,470
- I was coming to get you.
- What's that noise?

484
00:49:59,631 --> 00:50:01,792
Security alarm in Joe's habitat.
Come on.

485
00:50:11,877 --> 00:50:14,279
- Joe- Joe-
- What's happening?

486
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:16,440
- He's going crazy.
- Open the gate!

487
00:50:17,601 --> 00:50:19,762
Open it! Open it!

488
00:50:26,365 --> 00:50:28,528
- Hold it! Don't shoot!
- No!

489
00:50:40,214 --> 00:50:42,135
Oh, God.

490
00:50:42,255 --> 00:50:44,056
Harry, it's okay.

491
00:50:44,216 --> 00:50:46,338
- It doesn't feel okay.
- Listen to me.

492
00:50:46,458 --> 00:50:49,700
- Just jump out from behind the trees.
- No.

493
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:52,101
No, I'd rather not.

494
00:50:52,221 --> 00:50:55,703
Just jump out and say,
"You found me. "

495
00:50:55,823 --> 00:50:59,065
Well, he knows he's found me!
That's the problem!

496
00:50:59,185 --> 00:51:01,306
Harry, do what she says.

497
00:51:04,348 --> 00:51:08,271
You found me!

498
00:51:20,518 --> 00:51:24,240
Oh, God.
He's playing with him.

499
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,001
Harry, he's playing with you.

500
00:51:27,081 --> 00:51:29,283
- Hide-and-seek.
- What?

501
00:51:29,403 --> 00:51:31,564
Shh. Watch.

502
00:51:33,285 --> 00:51:36,647
Joe, where are you?

503
00:51:36,767 --> 00:51:38,728
Where could Joe be?

504
00:51:40,369 --> 00:51:43,931
- Here he is!
- Feeding time over, Harry?

505
00:51:44,091 --> 00:51:47,534
- Very funny.
- Good thing Joe didn't want to play doctor.

506
00:51:47,734 --> 00:51:50,736
Look at you, all happy.

507
00:51:50,856 --> 00:51:53,897
Huh, Joe?
That makes me so happy.

508
00:51:55,298 --> 00:51:57,820
- Harry.
- You know what? That never happened before.

509
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:01,702
- It was weird, wasn't it?
- Put that girl in charge of the gorilla.

510
00:52:01,822 --> 00:52:03,863
Elliot, she has
no scientific training.

511
00:52:03,983 --> 00:52:07,425
That ape is the best fund-raising tool
this conservancy's ever had.

512
00:52:07,545 --> 00:52:10,147
He's happy, I'm happy.

513
00:52:10,267 --> 00:52:12,428
So, you really think that
she's gonna be able to, you know-

514
00:52:12,548 --> 00:52:16,830
- Put her on the payroll, Harry.
- Okay.

515
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:19,672
- Did you see that? Did you see that?
- I saw, I saw.

516
00:52:19,832 --> 00:52:22,754
- He was playing hide-and-seek with him!
- It's great.

517
00:52:22,874 --> 00:52:24,876
You were right.
He likes it here.

518
00:52:28,638 --> 00:52:31,800
Oh, my God!
On his second day he's playing!

519
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,961
- He likes it here!
- Mm-mm-mm-mm.

520
00:52:35,082 --> 00:52:38,043
- You've got it bad.
- What are you talking about?

521
00:52:38,203 --> 00:52:40,365
You know what I'm talking about.

522
00:52:40,485 --> 00:52:44,407
Usually you are out the door
as soon as the animal's in his habitat.

523
00:52:44,527 --> 00:52:46,688
You have a very active imagination.

524
00:52:46,808 --> 00:52:48,769
I don't think so.

525
00:52:48,929 --> 00:52:51,891
- Oh, I think so.
- No, I don't think so.

526
00:52:52,051 --> 00:52:56,093
I think Mister World Traveller has
goo-goo eyes for the gorilla girl.

527
00:52:59,135 --> 00:53:01,056
Just close your eyes,
and then he's gonna do that.

528
00:53:01,176 --> 00:53:04,179
And then you say, "You found me!"
Come on.

529
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:10,062
Behind me is the habitat
of what the experts are calling...

530
00:53:10,182 --> 00:53:13,864
one of the world's most important
zoological finds of this century.

531
00:53:13,984 --> 00:53:18,067
This is the home of what is believed
to be the world's largest primate,

532
00:53:18,227 --> 00:53:21,789
a 2,000-pound gorilla named Joe.

533
00:53:21,909 --> 00:53:26,551
Joe has been at the California Animal
Conservancy for a little over a month now.

534
00:53:26,631 --> 00:53:29,993
He was brought here from Africa
by Dr Gregory O'Hara,

535
00:53:30,153 --> 00:53:33,475
- who told me that because of Joe's remarkable size,
- My God, Pindi was right.

536
00:53:33,595 --> 00:53:36,077
he is a natural target for poachers.

537
00:53:36,237 --> 00:53:40,679
- Fortunately, the California Animal Conservancy programme...
- He's beautiful.

538
00:53:40,799 --> 00:53:42,720
is rescuing animals
and bringing them here...

539
00:53:42,881 --> 00:53:45,243
- so they can-
- The most beautiful animal I ever seen.

540
00:53:45,363 --> 00:53:48,084
And the most valuable,
that's for sure.

541
00:53:48,204 --> 00:53:50,606
It can't escape
because it's surrounded by a moat,

542
00:53:50,726 --> 00:53:54,208
and there are also electrical wires
around the entire perimeter.

543
00:53:54,328 --> 00:53:56,209
- Isn't that the-
- Wait. Be quiet.

544
00:53:56,369 --> 00:54:00,291
Joe was raised from infancy by Jill Young,
the daughter of famed primatologist Ruth Young.

545
00:54:00,411 --> 00:54:03,293
Their closeness stems
from a tragic bond.

546
00:54:03,453 --> 00:54:07,255
Both Joe and Jill's mothers were killed by
poachers 12 years ago in the Pangani Forest.

547
00:54:07,415 --> 00:54:11,578
- Bloody hell, that's him!
- They both became orphans on the same night.

548
00:54:11,698 --> 00:54:14,459
That's the little fella
who bit your finger off!

549
00:54:18,261 --> 00:54:20,182
I'm always amazed how,

550
00:54:22,264 --> 00:54:28,148
if you wait long enough, the opportunity
for justice finally comes.

551
00:54:29,469 --> 00:54:32,230
Garth, book us two tickets
to America.

552
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:35,792
We are going to pay a visit
to this incredible animal.

553
00:54:35,912 --> 00:54:40,515
I think I know how to convince
his current owners to part with him.

554
00:54:46,078 --> 00:54:48,679
Now, this fellow is
one of only 300 wild yaks...

555
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:50,680
remaining on the planet.

556
00:54:50,841 --> 00:54:55,483
Now, you may ask: Why should we care
if this subspecies of yak survives?

557
00:54:55,563 --> 00:54:57,524
- But if we don't protect-
- Excuse me.

558
00:54:57,684 --> 00:54:59,846
Can we see Joe?

559
00:54:59,966 --> 00:55:02,848
Yes, you can certainly
all see Joe for the mere price of...

560
00:55:02,968 --> 00:55:06,130
a diamond circle benefactor ticket
to tomorrow night's benefit.

561
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:08,091
But, you know,
this is for a good cause.

562
00:55:08,211 --> 00:55:10,693
It's for the preservation
of an endangered species.

563
00:55:59,561 --> 00:56:02,082
You remember, don't you?

564
00:56:13,129 --> 00:56:16,891
- This is what you call
a good meal in a fine restaurant?

565
00:56:17,011 --> 00:56:19,492
Yeah.

566
00:56:19,572 --> 00:56:23,455
It's my favourite restaurant
'cause they let you take off your shoes.

567
00:56:28,058 --> 00:56:31,500
My granddad used to bring me
fishing down here when I was a kid.

568
00:56:32,541 --> 00:56:35,222
Wow. The Pacific Ocean.

569
00:56:38,504 --> 00:56:40,665
That's nice. Live music.

570
00:56:40,825 --> 00:56:42,666
I hired him special.

571
00:56:44,227 --> 00:56:46,829
Ten minutes ago.
You wanna dance?

572
00:56:46,949 --> 00:56:50,991
What?
So, this is a date, or something?

573
00:56:51,111 --> 00:56:54,153
Not that I'd know.
I've never been on one before.

574
00:56:54,233 --> 00:56:57,234
Yeah, well, I guess most guys
are afraid of a girl's father.

575
00:56:57,394 --> 00:57:00,597
I can just see a guy telling Joe
he's gonna get you home by midnight.

576
00:57:00,757 --> 00:57:05,520
Well, nobody's ever had to tell Joe
what time they'll have me home by.

577
00:57:10,683 --> 00:57:12,484
What's it like?

578
00:57:12,644 --> 00:57:14,245
"It"?

579
00:57:14,365 --> 00:57:19,168
Yeah. This whole dating,
dancing, love thing.

580
00:57:19,288 --> 00:57:22,169
Well, it's...

581
00:57:22,289 --> 00:57:25,091
kind of like being bit
by a Makiki spider.

582
00:57:28,453 --> 00:57:30,494
And how's that?

583
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:33,456
- You get kind of a fever.
- Fever?

584
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,497
Ah. And then?

585
00:57:35,657 --> 00:57:39,220
And then you-
you find yourself saying things.

586
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:41,301
Lots of things.

587
00:57:41,421 --> 00:57:43,382
What kind of things?

588
00:57:43,462 --> 00:57:45,303
Things like-

589
00:57:51,587 --> 00:57:53,508
What is it?

590
00:57:53,628 --> 00:57:55,709
I'm sorry.
It's this thing.

591
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:59,671
We gotta go.

592
00:58:12,478 --> 00:58:14,320
I don't understand
this animal.

593
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:17,441
- He's got everything he wants. Why can't he just relax?
- Harry, stop. Oh.

594
00:58:17,561 --> 00:58:19,443
He's ripping out saplings,
bam, bam, bam!

595
00:58:19,563 --> 00:58:21,565
- Taking out irrigation pipe.
- Really? Oh.

596
00:58:21,685 --> 00:58:23,446
One big yank,
here comes the flood.

597
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:26,527
- What happened? What's wrong with him?
- We don't know. Jill, do you?

598
00:58:26,647 --> 00:58:28,889
Is he okay?

599
00:58:29,009 --> 00:58:31,930
- Can you get in there and calm him down...
- Joe?

600
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,972
before he relandscapes
the habitat?

601
00:58:43,657 --> 00:58:46,058
Joe, it's okay.

602
00:58:54,943 --> 00:58:56,824
It's okay.

- Impossible.
- Please.

624
01:00:32,961 --> 01:00:35,242
I wouldn't be asking you
to postpone the benefit...

625
01:00:35,363 --> 01:00:37,604
unless I thought there was
something really wrong with Joe.

626
01:00:37,724 --> 01:00:39,965
And I do.

627
01:00:40,085 --> 01:00:44,648
From what I hear, you sang him to sleep
last night like a baby.

628
01:00:44,768 --> 01:00:47,129
What's really wrong
about that?

629
01:00:47,209 --> 01:00:52,172
Mr Baker, I swear to you,
Joe is still not himself.

630
01:00:52,292 --> 01:00:54,213
He's nervous and agitated,

631
01:00:54,333 --> 01:00:56,976
and he shouldn't be exposed
to a crowd of strangers right now.

632
01:00:57,096 --> 01:00:59,817
If you can just delay the party
just a few more-

633
01:00:59,937 --> 01:01:02,098
- It's too late, Jill.
- No!

634
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:09,142
- It's too soon.
- Miss Young, let me give you some advice:

635
01:01:09,262 --> 01:01:11,984
Stop worrying about Joe,

636
01:01:12,064 --> 01:01:15,586
and start worrying about what
you will wear to the party tonight.

637
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:36,679
Cecily?

638
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:38,800
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, my fault.

639
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:42,682
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

640
01:01:42,842 --> 01:01:44,603
It's just-

641
01:01:46,764 --> 01:01:50,086
- What?
- You must be Jill Young.

642
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:52,248
Yes?

643
01:01:52,368 --> 01:01:56,050
And you look just like her.

644
01:01:57,971 --> 01:02:00,372
- Who?
- Your mother.

645
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:09,017
- You knew my mother?
- Yes.

646
01:02:09,137 --> 01:02:12,259
I'm an old friend
of your mother's.

647
01:02:12,419 --> 01:02:16,302
I knew her when she was, uh,
only a little older than you.

648
01:02:16,422 --> 01:02:19,024
- And you were just a tiny thing.
- Oh.

649
01:02:20,264 --> 01:02:24,867
- What an incredible woman she was.
- Yeah.

650
01:02:24,987 --> 01:02:27,388
I'm sorry.
I'm Andre Strasser.

651
01:02:27,508 --> 01:02:31,711
I've come here
to talk with your Mr Baker.

652
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:35,353
- Actually, I'm here for Joe.
- Joe?

653
01:02:35,473 --> 01:02:37,954
And, in a way,
for your mother too.

654
01:02:38,074 --> 01:02:39,875
I believe she would agree with me.

655
01:02:39,995 --> 01:02:42,957
A magnificent wild animal
like Joe needs more space,

656
01:02:43,077 --> 01:02:45,839
like the Raja Preserve
I run in Botswana.

657
01:02:45,959 --> 01:02:48,440
Raja Preserve?

658
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:51,082
It's 20,000 acres there...

659
01:02:51,242 --> 01:02:54,324
where the animals
are free to run.

660
01:02:54,444 --> 01:02:59,927
Here it's such a shame to see Joe
living in a man-made habitat...

661
01:03:00,048 --> 01:03:02,849
and being used as
an attraction to raise money.

662
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:06,651
But I upset you.

663
01:03:06,811 --> 01:03:08,692
- No.
- Please.

664
01:03:08,852 --> 01:03:11,534
I only mean to offer
an alternative.

665
01:03:14,015 --> 01:03:17,577
Anyway, here is my card.

666
01:03:17,737 --> 01:03:20,579
I'll be attending
the event tonight.

667
01:03:20,699 --> 01:03:22,900
Maybe we can talk more
about this matter then.

668
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:25,302
I look forward to it.

669
01:03:26,782 --> 01:03:28,664
Yeah. Bye.

670
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:41,992
Boy, I can't believe
all the V.I.P.s here tonight.

671
01:03:42,112 --> 01:03:45,114
Ooh, don't you clean up nice?

672
01:03:45,274 --> 01:03:48,476
- Cecily, you look ravishing.
- Thank you.

673
01:03:48,596 --> 01:03:52,238
Harry, you got a little, um,
cocktail sauce on your shirt there.

674
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:55,400
Oh, great.
Now I look ridiculous.

675
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:59,602
No, you look fine.
They look ridiculous.

676
01:03:59,762 --> 01:04:01,963
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, well, she doesn't.

677
01:04:13,571 --> 01:04:16,172
I picked out the dress.
Aren't I smart?

678
01:04:16,292 --> 01:04:18,373
Brilliant.

679
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:21,895
Harry, you're dripping again.

680
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:24,537
Oh, look at me.
I'm a mess here.

681
01:04:24,657 --> 01:04:26,498
You know, I have to give
a speech tonight.

682
01:04:26,618 --> 01:04:28,619
You think anyone'll notice?

683
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:30,940
No.

684
01:04:32,061 --> 01:04:34,062
Hi.

685
01:04:34,182 --> 01:04:37,064
I feel so stupid
in this dress.

686
01:04:37,304 --> 01:04:39,185
You look anything but stupid.

687
01:04:39,345 --> 01:04:41,146
Come on,
let's get a drink.

688
01:04:42,507 --> 01:04:44,508
She reminds me of somebody,

689
01:04:44,628 --> 01:04:47,149
but...
I can't think who it is.

690
01:04:47,270 --> 01:04:49,751
You, when we first met.

691
01:04:51,073 --> 01:04:53,034
Why are they staring at me?

692
01:04:53,154 --> 01:04:57,756
They're not staring at you, they're
staring at, uh, that banana tower.

693
01:04:59,197 --> 01:05:01,078
Very funny.

694
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:04,080
Come on.

695
01:05:07,402 --> 01:05:10,684
It's nice to see you all.
Good evening.

696
01:05:10,804 --> 01:05:13,285
- Quite a turnout.
- All the better.

697
01:05:13,405 --> 01:05:15,807
Ladies and gentlemen,
would you please take your seats?

698
01:05:15,927 --> 01:05:19,208
Please. Can I have
your attention, please?

699
01:05:19,409 --> 01:05:22,050
Can I have your attention, please?

700
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:25,372
- Take your seats.
- Ooh, I'm sorry. Oh.

701
01:05:25,492 --> 01:05:27,853
Excuse me, sir, you, uh,
dropped your, uh-

702
01:05:27,973 --> 01:05:30,136
- Key chain.
- Ah, of course.

703
01:05:30,336 --> 01:05:33,257
Garth, you would lose your head
if it wasn't screwed on.

704
01:05:34,498 --> 01:05:36,579
Nice party, huh?

705
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:39,581
Just take your seats.
- Where do we think he's from?

706
01:05:39,821 --> 01:05:43,263
- I don't know.
- I'm Elliot Baker.

707
01:05:43,383 --> 01:05:46,425
The world was once
a garden teeming with life.

708
01:05:46,545 --> 01:05:50,547
A wondrous place to contemplate
creation in all its-

709
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,161
- So, you haven't forgotten me?
Can I have your attention?

710
01:06:14,281 --> 01:06:16,322
As you can hear, the secret...

711
01:06:16,443 --> 01:06:18,724
- announced itself loud and clear.
- Good.

712
01:06:18,844 --> 01:06:21,325
Have you forgotten this?

713
01:06:35,413 --> 01:06:37,975
How much do you think he's worth,
couple of million?

714
01:06:38,095 --> 01:06:42,737
After we sell him off,
piece by piece,

715
01:06:42,857 --> 01:06:45,059
who knows how much we'll make?

716
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:50,342
Ah, that got you going.

717
01:06:50,463 --> 01:06:53,464
Now be a good boy
and frighten the ladies.

718
01:06:53,624 --> 01:06:57,386
Can I have your attention?
Our guest seems to be telling you...

719
01:06:57,506 --> 01:07:00,948
- that I'm talking too long.
- Okay, let's go. We've done our job here.

720
01:07:01,068 --> 01:07:04,470
I'd like to bring up to the podium
the director of our conservancy-

721
01:07:06,992 --> 01:07:12,235
Well, I suppose there's no need
to add to that introduction.

722
01:07:12,355 --> 01:07:14,476
Here's Dr Harry Ruben!

723
01:07:19,479 --> 01:07:22,761
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

724
01:07:22,881 --> 01:07:24,922
In the time it took you
to drive here tonight,

725
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:29,005
three species have disappeared
from the Earth.

726
01:07:29,165 --> 01:07:32,687
Extinct. Never to be replaced.

727
01:07:34,128 --> 01:07:36,489
We here at the conservancy
say this is a tragedy-

728
01:07:38,931 --> 01:07:42,012
Well, uh, obviously Joe agrees.

729
01:07:42,132 --> 01:07:45,134
- There's something wrong.
- But, um,

730
01:07:45,254 --> 01:07:49,016
tonight, instead of focusing
on what we've lost,

731
01:07:49,136 --> 01:07:52,098
we'd like to introduce you
to something that we've found.

732
01:07:52,258 --> 01:07:56,741
Ladies and gentlemen, behind
this curtain is the newest member...

733
01:07:56,861 --> 01:08:00,103
of the California Animal Conservancy.

734
01:08:00,223 --> 01:08:04,105
We are very happy and proud
to introduce to you,

735
01:08:04,225 --> 01:08:07,388
Mighty Joe-

736
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:17,513
Joe?

737
01:08:19,755 --> 01:08:21,556
It's okay.

738
01:08:23,076 --> 01:08:26,238
Come on, Joe.

739
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,922
No! Joe!

740
01:08:50,653 --> 01:08:52,574
My God, what's wrong with him?

741
01:08:52,694 --> 01:08:55,135
He's out of control!
I'm going for the tranq gun!

742
01:08:55,255 --> 01:08:57,417
No, Gregg!
I'll stop him!

743
01:09:06,862 --> 01:09:09,664
Oh, my God!

744
01:09:10,744 --> 01:09:12,665
Move!

745
01:09:23,671 --> 01:09:26,674
Oh, God.

746
01:09:52,128 --> 01:09:54,410
The gorilla
literally crashed the party.

747
01:09:54,530 --> 01:09:56,491
Officials here at the conservancy
are saying...

748
01:09:56,651 --> 01:09:59,532
they don't know what caused
the animal's rampage.

749
01:09:59,652 --> 01:10:01,774
More than a dozen people
were injured.

750
01:10:01,854 --> 01:10:04,215
Eight of them remain
hospitalized today.

751
01:10:04,335 --> 01:10:06,577
In fact, three lawsuits
have been filed so far,

752
01:10:06,737 --> 01:10:11,060
and word has it the city's attorney is
calling for the animal to be put to sleep.

753
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:14,262
Standing with me is the conservancy
board's chairman, Elliot Baker.

754
01:10:14,422 --> 01:10:18,744
Exactly what is being done to assure
the public that Joe won't attack again?

755
01:10:18,864 --> 01:10:23,107
Joe has been transferred to a special
steel-reinforced concrete bunker.

756
01:10:23,227 --> 01:10:24,988
But what about
when you let him out?

757
01:10:25,148 --> 01:10:28,109
That won't be happening any time soon.

758
01:10:28,189 --> 01:10:31,111
In fact, I want to make it clear
that we will be doing...

759
01:10:31,231 --> 01:10:34,673
anything necessary to ensure
the safety of the public.

760
01:10:34,833 --> 01:10:37,955
With the number of
lawsuits the conservancy is now facing,

761
01:10:38,075 --> 01:10:40,917
will you shut down the facility
to the public?

762
01:10:43,158 --> 01:10:45,120
Joe.

763
01:10:49,002 --> 01:10:51,484
I'm right here. Okay?

764
01:10:55,966 --> 01:10:58,047
I knew there was
something wrong with him.

765
01:10:58,167 --> 01:11:00,649
What do you think
happened out there?

766
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:05,772
Joe would have never hurt
those people unprovoked.

767
01:11:05,892 --> 01:11:07,813
Something must've got to him.

768
01:11:13,056 --> 01:11:14,777
Jill?

769
01:11:16,377 --> 01:11:19,419
Could I, um, talk to you for a second?

770
01:11:37,270 --> 01:11:40,312
Well, this wasn't
in the brochure, was it?

771
01:11:48,276 --> 01:11:51,198
I promised you wouldn't be
put in a cage.

772
01:11:53,759 --> 01:11:56,521
I'm sorry, Joe.

773
01:12:37,985 --> 01:12:41,227
Then the city attorney
talked to Baker.

774
01:12:41,347 --> 01:12:43,990
- I had nothing to do with this.
- With what?

775
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:47,592
Joe's gonna have to stay in here until
they decide what they're gonna do with him.

776
01:12:47,712 --> 01:12:49,553
- In here?
- Yeah.

777
01:12:49,713 --> 01:12:51,634
Harry, look at him.

778
01:12:51,794 --> 01:12:53,715
He's depressed.
He won't eat.

779
01:12:53,795 --> 01:12:57,197
If he stays in here,
he'll die within days.

780
01:12:57,397 --> 01:12:59,518
There is nothing we can do.

781
01:12:59,638 --> 01:13:02,200
Either you tell them you're getting
Joe out of here, or I will.

782
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:05,001
This is way beyond
you and me.

783
01:13:05,161 --> 01:13:07,283
Joe freaked out on some
very influential people.

784
01:13:07,403 --> 01:13:09,444
Now he's a public relations nightmare.

785
01:13:09,604 --> 01:13:12,806
No zoo will take
a 2,000-pound killer gorilla!

786
01:13:12,926 --> 01:13:15,127
- He's not a killer!
- Okay, okay.

787
01:13:15,287 --> 01:13:17,528
But unless you can write a cheque
for millions of dollars...

788
01:13:17,688 --> 01:13:19,770
and find him
a big backyard somewhere,

789
01:13:19,890 --> 01:13:21,852
then Joe's got nowhere to go.

790
01:13:22,012 --> 01:13:24,493
I'm sorry.

791
01:13:25,574 --> 01:13:28,375
Harry.

792
01:13:28,495 --> 01:13:31,897
You're not gonna do anything?

793
01:13:57,352 --> 01:13:59,233
I need your help.

794
01:14:04,757 --> 01:14:06,598
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

795
01:14:06,758 --> 01:14:09,639
- You can't go in there.
- It's okay. We're here to give Joe more sedatives.

796
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,721
Wha- I, uh-

797
01:14:11,841 --> 01:14:14,682
Unless you want him
to get frisky on your shift,

798
01:14:14,802 --> 01:14:18,164
I suggest you let us get on with our job
so you can get on with yours.

799
01:14:33,573 --> 01:14:35,134
Come on, Joe.

800
01:14:35,214 --> 01:14:36,895
We're leaving.

801
01:14:37,015 --> 01:14:38,296
Yeah.

802
01:14:38,456 --> 01:14:40,938
Let's get you out of here.

803
01:14:42,259 --> 01:14:44,620
What the hell are you doin'?

804
01:14:46,501 --> 01:14:50,303
The gorilla needs medication, and I've
gotta take him over to the clinic for that.

805
01:14:50,423 --> 01:14:53,905
- Who says?
- Doctor's orders, and I'm the doctor.

806
01:14:54,025 --> 01:14:57,107
Yeah, well, uh,
I take my orders from Mr Baker,

807
01:14:57,227 --> 01:15:00,029
so, uh, put him back
in his cage now.

808
01:15:00,149 --> 01:15:02,430
Easy, Joe, easy.

809
01:15:04,471 --> 01:15:07,913
Officer, you don't want to point
that thing at him, believe me.

810
01:15:14,997 --> 01:15:16,758
He didn't believe you.

811
01:15:30,247 --> 01:15:33,208
Okay, come on!
Bring him out!

812
01:15:40,973 --> 01:15:44,014
Come on, big guy.
Come on.

813
01:15:55,941 --> 01:15:58,784
Come on, Joe.
Into the truck.

814
01:15:58,904 --> 01:16:01,345
That's it.

815
01:16:03,866 --> 01:16:05,788
Okay.

816
01:16:07,949 --> 01:16:09,870
Thanks.

817
01:16:18,755 --> 01:16:21,596
I am gonna miss
those big ol' brown eyes.

818
01:16:24,118 --> 01:16:25,959
You be good, Joe.

819
01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:28,440
Goodbye, Joe.

820
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:31,962
I was just starting to get
the hang of hide-and-seek.

821
01:16:34,123 --> 01:16:39,607
I, uh, I think you should be
all right up here at the gate.

822
01:16:39,728 --> 01:16:44,130
Someone, uh, just called the guard away.
Urgent business.

823
01:16:45,651 --> 01:16:47,972
You came through for us, Harry.

824
01:16:50,734 --> 01:16:53,415
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

825
01:16:58,658 --> 01:17:01,980
You be sure to write us
as soon as you get Joe settled, okay?

826
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:04,581
I promise.

827
01:17:05,862 --> 01:17:08,023
Okay. You're all set.

828
01:17:08,143 --> 01:17:10,305
So, you're gonna...

829
01:17:10,425 --> 01:17:13,146
come to the airport,
or-

830
01:17:13,266 --> 01:17:16,188
No, I'm gonna hang back and make sure
nobody notices Joe's gone,

831
01:17:16,308 --> 01:17:19,111
give you guys a chance
to make a run for it.

832
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:21,312
Okay.

833
01:17:21,512 --> 01:17:25,634
If you're ever in Botswana and feel like taking
me out for a good meal at a fine restaurant-

834
01:17:25,754 --> 01:17:29,917
That is, if you're not too afraid
to let Joe know what time you'll be-

835
01:17:40,082 --> 01:17:43,804
Jill, we should go now.
The plane is waiting.

836
01:17:45,685 --> 01:17:47,767
Come.
Let's go.

837
01:17:47,967 --> 01:17:50,648
- Gotta go.
- Yeah.

838
01:18:05,458 --> 01:18:08,619
- Hello.
- Hi.

839
01:18:14,543 --> 01:18:16,424
Don't worry, Jill.

840
01:18:16,544 --> 01:18:19,225
Soon Joe will be
back home again.

841
01:18:28,430 --> 01:18:30,271
So, what do you think?

842
01:18:30,392 --> 01:18:33,313
How many minutes before the whole world
knows he's missing?

843
01:18:33,433 --> 01:18:35,274
- Five.
- Hmph.

844
01:18:35,434 --> 01:18:40,478
- How many minutes before we're both looking through the want ads?
- Six.

845
01:18:41,959 --> 01:18:43,760
What are you guys doin' here?

846
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,761
What are you guys
doin' here?

847
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:48,603
Baker wants us to clean up
the tent A.S.A.P.

848
01:18:48,723 --> 01:18:52,125
Yeah, you should see some of the stuff
we found in the post-party melee.

849
01:18:52,245 --> 01:18:55,086
We've got the fun job of figuring out
who all this stuff belongs to.

850
01:18:55,206 --> 01:18:57,648
Somebody's head
is very cold right now.

851
01:18:57,808 --> 01:19:01,250
Look at this. What is this thing?

852
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:04,372
Where did you find this?

853
01:19:04,492 --> 01:19:07,773
- By the habitat. We gotta find those two guys.
- What two guys?

854
01:19:07,934 --> 01:19:11,135
What, that- that one guy,
he was, what, Lithuanian.

855
01:19:11,255 --> 01:19:13,657
Yeah, Russian.
Eastern European.

856
01:19:13,777 --> 01:19:16,659
- Is everything okay?
- That thing's used by poachers!

857
01:19:23,543 --> 01:19:25,704
Please, be careful.

858
01:19:25,905 --> 01:19:28,266
Always worrying, huh?

859
01:19:28,386 --> 01:19:30,987
Your mother was a worrier too.

860
01:19:31,148 --> 01:19:34,029
Always worrying
about the gorillas.

861
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:38,952
It made her a lot of enemies.

862
01:19:39,072 --> 01:19:41,153
It led to tragedy.

863
01:19:42,234 --> 01:19:44,155
My mother was brave.

864
01:19:45,275 --> 01:19:47,116
So are you, my dear.

865
01:19:55,882 --> 01:19:58,924
What? It's not pretty.
I know.

866
01:20:00,085 --> 01:20:02,006
I'm sorry.

867
01:20:02,126 --> 01:20:03,967
How did it happen?

868
01:20:07,489 --> 01:20:10,290
Well, you could say
I had an encounter...

869
01:20:10,411 --> 01:20:12,212
with a monster.

870
01:20:13,412 --> 01:20:14,973
Monstrule.

871
01:20:17,134 --> 01:20:18,575
"Monstrule. "

872
01:20:18,735 --> 01:20:21,096
Oh! That little demon...

873
01:20:21,217 --> 01:20:23,498
took off my thumb
and trigger finger!

874
01:20:23,618 --> 01:20:27,220
Monstrule! Monstrule!

875
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:45,431
Come on, come on!

876
01:21:02,201 --> 01:21:04,642
Murderer! Aaah!

877
01:21:15,529 --> 01:21:17,370
Jeez!

878
01:21:23,013 --> 01:21:25,254
Joe! Get out!

879
01:21:25,374 --> 01:21:27,296
Keep driving!

880
01:21:30,057 --> 01:21:32,659
Jill! Are you okay?

881
01:21:34,059 --> 01:21:36,821
What did I do? Those are
the guys who killed my mother.

882
01:21:36,941 --> 01:21:39,262
We gotta go!
Joe's in trouble!

883
01:21:40,743 --> 01:21:42,824
Whoa!

884
01:21:52,831 --> 01:21:55,072
Stop it!

885
01:21:56,073 --> 01:21:57,634
Ohh!

886
01:21:59,314 --> 01:22:02,716
Get out of the way! Get out
of the way! Come on, let's go!

887
01:22:05,158 --> 01:22:06,999
Come on, move it!
Move it!

888
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:09,600
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

889
01:22:20,686 --> 01:22:23,048
- Whoa! Look!
- Can you see it?

890
01:22:36,536 --> 01:22:39,538
What? Come on.
Nobody's seen an accident? What?

891
01:22:54,787 --> 01:22:57,788
Oh, my God.

892
01:23:02,711 --> 01:23:04,552
Phat!

893
01:23:04,672 --> 01:23:07,314
Come on. Come on!

894
01:23:07,434 --> 01:23:10,756
Will you just go!

895
01:23:34,290 --> 01:23:36,171
- Come on.
- Wait.

896
01:23:36,331 --> 01:23:38,212
The police will be here
any second.

897
01:23:38,332 --> 01:23:41,013
We have to get away from here.

898
01:23:45,216 --> 01:23:47,377
Ape! Oh, my God!

899
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:11,712
Far out!

900
01:24:13,833 --> 01:24:15,594
All right!

901
01:24:28,361 --> 01:24:30,643
Turn it off!

902
01:24:44,331 --> 01:24:47,213
Go, Lisa, go!
Hurry!

903
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:48,813
Aaah!

904
01:24:54,136 --> 01:24:56,978
Oh... my God.

905
01:24:57,138 --> 01:25:00,180
Oh, my God. Shut up!

906
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:03,021
- What are you laughing at?
- That was so cool!

907
01:25:03,141 --> 01:25:05,063
- Cool?
- He almost squashed us!

908
01:25:05,183 --> 01:25:07,904
That was not funny at all!

909
01:25:29,597 --> 01:25:31,558
- Yeah!
- Go, Joe! Yeah!

910
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:50,730
- All right!
- Go, Joe!

911
01:26:03,257 --> 01:26:05,498
Oh, no.

912
01:26:05,618 --> 01:26:07,459
He's not here.

913
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:09,581
- Couldn't have gotten far.
- Come on, girls.

914
01:26:09,741 --> 01:26:13,103
- Come on. This way.
- Let's go.

915
01:26:16,945 --> 01:26:20,107
Copy that. Our orders are shoot
to kill. He's extremely dangerous.

916
01:26:20,227 --> 01:26:23,308
Shoot to kill? He's not dangerous.
You're dangerous!

917
01:26:23,428 --> 01:26:25,309
It's okay, Officer.
She didn't mean it.

918
01:26:25,349 --> 01:26:28,632
- I meant it! They're going to shoot him.
- Not if we find him first.

919
01:26:28,752 --> 01:26:30,633
What's that?

920
01:26:32,875 --> 01:26:34,716
That's it.
We'll follow that helicopter.

921
01:26:34,836 --> 01:26:36,557
- What?
- Come on!

922
01:27:04,092 --> 01:27:07,535
I'm already 20 minutes late.
Who's gonna pay for this?

923
01:27:09,416 --> 01:27:13,018
What are you doing?
We can't go after the gorilla now.

924
01:27:14,219 --> 01:27:15,980
We need a car.

925
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:18,341
What is your supervisor's name?

926
01:27:18,461 --> 01:27:21,703
- Would you please step out of the vehicle.
- What's the problem?

927
01:27:22,744 --> 01:27:25,825
Fifth time this year.
Hey. Hey!

928
01:27:25,945 --> 01:27:27,826
Hey, I'm goin'!
I'm goin'!

929
01:27:27,987 --> 01:27:30,908
You don't have to be so pushy about it!

930
01:27:31,028 --> 01:27:33,630
Hello?
County Animal Control?

931
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:36,631
- You're not gonna believe this.
- Honey, look at the birdbath.

932
01:27:36,791 --> 01:27:39,073
Yes! Yes, it was
a gorilla, a big one!

933
01:27:39,193 --> 01:27:41,154
Did you guys see it?

934
01:27:41,274 --> 01:27:44,716
Andy, come on, sweetheart.
No, no. It's a gorilla, honey.

935
01:28:13,933 --> 01:28:17,335
SWAT One, SWAT One, this is Police 2-4.
We've found him.

936
01:28:40,749 --> 01:28:44,031
Yeah, Police 2-4,
SWAT One's on the scene.

937
01:28:45,712 --> 01:28:48,754
He's goin' in the brush.
Don't lose him.

938
01:29:32,419 --> 01:29:34,460
We've got him now.

939
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:50,951
Look out!
Electrical wires!

940
01:29:51,111 --> 01:29:52,632
Pull up! Pull up!

941
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:08,440
Where'd he go?

942
01:30:11,642 --> 01:30:14,604
- He must have gone under that overpass.
- Well, cut him off.

943
01:30:19,967 --> 01:30:22,008
Bring 'er down.

944
01:30:35,897 --> 01:30:37,778
Must've gone up
that access ramp.

945
01:30:39,059 --> 01:30:41,380
Let's go find 'im.
Let's go.

946
01:31:23,284 --> 01:31:25,686
Where's he headed?

947
01:31:27,006 --> 01:31:29,528
Look.
He thinks it's my flashlight.

948
01:31:29,728 --> 01:31:33,690
He's going towards the light.
He thinks I'm calling him. That's it!

949
01:32:03,428 --> 01:32:06,309
- Daddy!
- Hi, Mommy!

950
01:32:06,429 --> 01:32:10,312
- Mom, I don't think you should go on this ride.
- Why?

951
01:32:10,472 --> 01:32:13,914
- Because you threw up last time.
- What if I promise to throw up over the side?

952
01:32:14,074 --> 01:32:15,955
I should go on this by myself.

953
01:32:16,075 --> 01:32:18,876
Okay. I'll get us
some cotton candy.

954
01:32:18,997 --> 01:32:21,599
- Okay.
- And no rocking, Jason!

955
01:32:21,719 --> 01:32:23,920
- Okay.
- Have a good time.

956
01:32:27,762 --> 01:32:30,564
All you gotta do is
hit the pig on the bottom!

957
01:32:30,684 --> 01:32:33,165
That's all you gotta do!

958
01:33:01,342 --> 01:33:04,944
Oh, my- Honey, come on.
Come on with Mommy. Give Mommy a break.

959
01:33:05,104 --> 01:33:07,466
- No, Mommy, let's stay!
- No, honey!

960
01:33:07,586 --> 01:33:09,787
Please!

961
01:33:37,282 --> 01:33:39,164
Come on, let's stop it!

962
01:33:39,244 --> 01:33:42,046
Come on, kids, outta there.
There's a wild animal loose.

963
01:33:42,166 --> 01:33:44,087
- Find your parents. Go! Go!
- Whoa!

964
01:33:44,207 --> 01:33:47,329
See that thing?

965
01:33:48,930 --> 01:33:50,731
Yow!

966
01:33:53,452 --> 01:33:56,214
Holy-

967
01:34:08,941 --> 01:34:10,582
Come on.

968
01:34:13,904 --> 01:34:15,705
There she is.

969
01:34:15,865 --> 01:34:18,267
Just what exactly
are you aiming at?

970
01:34:20,669 --> 01:34:23,270
No! You can't do that.

971
01:34:23,470 --> 01:34:26,512
If that girl starts telling people
who we really are,

972
01:34:26,632 --> 01:34:30,314
our whole cover operation
will be blown.

973
01:34:30,474 --> 01:34:32,275
She's not an animal.

974
01:34:32,435 --> 01:34:34,837
- She's a human being.
- Joe!

975
01:34:36,758 --> 01:34:38,519
Let's go this way.

976
01:34:45,643 --> 01:34:48,084
That was very stupid, Garth.

977
01:34:48,244 --> 01:34:50,685
- What was that?
- I don't know. Come on.

978
01:34:52,006 --> 01:34:54,888
Fire!

979
01:34:55,008 --> 01:34:56,769
Fire!

980
01:34:56,889 --> 01:34:59,331
- Go on! Find Joe!
- Joe!

981
01:34:59,491 --> 01:35:03,414
You're not a hunter, you're a murderer,
and I don't want any part of this.

982
01:35:06,015 --> 01:35:08,016
Anything else on your mind?

983
01:35:14,260 --> 01:35:18,622
The fire's spreading fast. Keep this
wheel moving. We'll get 'em out on the run.

984
01:35:18,782 --> 01:35:21,784
Come on, you guys.
All right. That's it.

985
01:35:23,985 --> 01:35:26,386
Okay, come on.

986
01:35:26,507 --> 01:35:28,308
Oh, my God.

987
01:35:30,309 --> 01:35:32,790
Keep running! Hurry!

988
01:35:32,870 --> 01:35:34,911
Move it!

989
01:35:43,837 --> 01:35:45,398
Mommy!

990
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:52,762
Okay, we got everybody off! Thanks!

991
01:35:59,166 --> 01:36:01,047
Aaah!

992
01:36:02,648 --> 01:36:04,569
- Go, go, go!
- Help!

993
01:36:09,372 --> 01:36:11,253
It's an ape!

994
01:36:11,413 --> 01:36:13,214
Jason!

995
01:36:14,775 --> 01:36:16,416
Jason!

996
01:36:50,676 --> 01:36:53,517
Joe!

997
01:36:57,961 --> 01:36:59,842
Goodbye, Jill.

998
01:37:00,002 --> 01:37:03,244
Meet your mother...
in hell.

999
01:37:04,364 --> 01:37:06,005
Goodbye.

1000
01:37:43,267 --> 01:37:45,909
Bring the marksmen
up here now!

1001
01:38:21,570 --> 01:38:24,371
We need paramedics. Over.

1002
01:38:24,491 --> 01:38:26,172
Jill!

1003
01:38:26,292 --> 01:38:29,414
Strasser was here. Joe just killed him.
We gotta get out of here now.

1004
01:38:29,534 --> 01:38:31,535
It's too late.

1005
01:38:31,695 --> 01:38:34,177
No. We gotta stop 'em.
Come on!

1006
01:38:34,297 --> 01:38:37,939
Mom! Mom!

1007
01:38:38,059 --> 01:38:41,381
- Evacuate the area! Get out of the way!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1008
01:38:41,501 --> 01:38:43,382
- He's not dangerous!
- Get out of here!

1009
01:38:46,904 --> 01:38:48,665
Mom!

1010
01:38:51,506 --> 01:38:53,949
Mommy, help me.

1011
01:39:15,081 --> 01:39:17,042
Joe?

1012
01:39:20,323 --> 01:39:22,845
- Joe!
- Fire upon my command!

1013
01:39:26,927 --> 01:39:29,128
Ready!

1014
01:39:29,248 --> 01:39:31,930
Officer, I can't find my son,

1015
01:39:32,050 --> 01:39:35,613
and I never saw him
get off the Ferris wheel.

1016
01:39:35,733 --> 01:39:37,454
Look!

1017
01:39:37,614 --> 01:39:39,455
Oh, my God!

1018
01:39:41,056 --> 01:39:43,738
- Jason!
- Mommy.

1019
01:39:43,858 --> 01:39:45,899
Mommy!

1020
01:39:54,143 --> 01:39:57,705
He's gonna try and save him.
Don't shoot!

1021
01:40:05,270 --> 01:40:07,671
Hold your fire!

1022
01:40:22,961 --> 01:40:25,402
Come on, Joe.

1023
01:40:25,522 --> 01:40:28,564
Get the trucks in place.

1024
01:40:40,290 --> 01:40:42,692
Help, please!

1025
01:40:43,812 --> 01:40:45,293
He's gonna be okay.

1026
01:40:49,695 --> 01:40:52,378
- Mom.
- Hang on.

1027
01:41:08,507 --> 01:41:11,108
He's got him.

1028
01:41:12,509 --> 01:41:15,671
Oh, no! Jason!

1029
01:41:24,556 --> 01:41:27,117
Come on, Joe.

1030
01:41:29,319 --> 01:41:32,401
Oh, my God, it's gonna tip!
It's gonna tilt!

1031
01:41:32,521 --> 01:41:34,483
- Everybody get back! Run!
- Joe!

1032
01:41:34,603 --> 01:41:37,604
- No! No!
- Joe!

1033
01:41:37,724 --> 01:41:40,686
Get out of the way! Run!

1034
01:41:43,047 --> 01:41:45,329
Come on! Come on!

1035
01:41:50,732 --> 01:41:53,013
No!

1036
01:41:58,256 --> 01:41:59,697
Aaah!

1037
01:42:04,780 --> 01:42:06,781
No!

1038
01:42:29,154 --> 01:42:31,716
Oh, please!
Oh, baby!

1039
01:42:33,116 --> 01:42:34,797
- Joe!
- Easy does it.

1040
01:42:34,917 --> 01:42:36,838
Open your eyes.
Come on, big guy.

1041
01:42:36,959 --> 01:42:39,720
- Come on. Oh, yeah, honey.
- Mommy!

1042
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:42,242
- Ohh. I'm here.
- Come on, big guy.

1043
01:42:42,402 --> 01:42:45,924
- Open your eyes.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

1044
01:42:46,084 --> 01:42:48,165
Come on, Joe!

1045
01:42:48,285 --> 01:42:52,648
Joe?
No. No. No.

1046
01:42:52,808 --> 01:42:56,450
- Mommy, is he gonna be okay?
- I don't know, honey.

1047
01:42:56,611 --> 01:42:59,092
No. No!

1048
01:42:59,212 --> 01:43:00,893
Joe!

1049
01:43:03,294 --> 01:43:05,536
Keep these people back!

1050
01:43:05,656 --> 01:43:08,777
Back it up!

1051
01:43:08,897 --> 01:43:10,778
No.

1052
01:43:12,259 --> 01:43:14,140
No!

1053
01:43:21,504 --> 01:43:24,546
Don't leave me, big guy.

1054
01:44:19,379 --> 01:44:21,780
Joe?

1055
01:44:26,543 --> 01:44:29,385
Joe?

1056
01:44:29,625 --> 01:44:32,426
- He's alive!
- He's alive?

1057
01:44:32,546 --> 01:44:34,707
- Joe!
- He's alive!

1058
01:44:37,949 --> 01:44:40,111
- Joe.
- He's alive!

1059
01:44:40,271 --> 01:44:44,313
You big palooka.
That's no way to ride a Ferris wheel.

1060
01:44:44,433 --> 01:44:46,475
Joe!
Big guy, you scared me.

1061
01:44:46,555 --> 01:44:50,157
We gotta get him outta here,
get him somewhere safe.

1062
01:44:52,318 --> 01:44:54,039
Somewhere safe?

1063
01:44:56,241 --> 01:44:59,002
Somewhere safe means
a new home for Joe.

1064
01:44:59,122 --> 01:45:02,124
Where are we gonna get
that kind of money?

1065
01:45:02,244 --> 01:45:04,845
I've got some money for Joe.

1066
01:45:17,012 --> 01:45:19,974
Here. For Joe.

1067
01:45:20,094 --> 01:45:23,336
- Folks, let's help him out.
- Thank you.

1068
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:26,258
Thank you.

1069
01:45:26,418 --> 01:45:28,700
Thank you.

1070
01:45:33,422 --> 01:45:35,263
Dear Cecily,

1071
01:45:35,383 --> 01:45:39,906
I promised to write you when Joe
was settled, and now I finally can.

1072
01:45:40,026 --> 01:45:42,908
With all the contributions
people sent in for Joe,

1073
01:45:42,988 --> 01:45:47,750
we were able to buy a beautiful land
preserve that's even big enough for him.

1074
01:45:50,352 --> 01:45:53,354
Tome fahura!

1075
01:45:53,474 --> 01:45:57,036
We dedicated
the Joe Young Wildlife Park today,

1076
01:45:57,156 --> 01:46:00,518
and it was one of
the happiest days of my life.

1077
01:46:05,321 --> 01:46:07,162
At last...

1078
01:46:07,322 --> 01:46:10,084
I have kept my promise
to my mother.

1079
01:46:13,006 --> 01:46:16,608
The people here are saying N'Gai Zamu
the sacred guardian...

1080
01:46:16,808 --> 01:46:19,689
has returned to protect the mountains.

1081
01:46:19,809 --> 01:46:24,332
Other people still say
N'Gai Zamu is just a legend.

1082
01:46:24,452 --> 01:46:27,734
I say legends live forever.
