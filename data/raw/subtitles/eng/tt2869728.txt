1
00:00:54,453 --> 00:00:55,621
Nick, be good.

2
00:00:56,121 --> 00:00:57,891
Ladies, are we having a good time?

3
00:01:00,892 --> 00:01:04,030
Shayla, you know
you're my brown sugar Barbie.

4
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,299
And you're my Asian daddy.

5
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,100
You're a naughty girl, Shayla.

6
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,802
- Wait. I'll be right back.
- Don't tease me.

7
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:12,037
- You ready?
- My God.

8
00:01:12,137 --> 00:01:14,906
Okay, jus... Yes. Yes.

9
00:01:15,006 --> 00:01:18,977
Bounce the mouse, big daddy!
Bounce the mouse! Spank me!

10
00:01:19,077 --> 00:01:21,781
You are the nastiest of all girls.

11
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:23,281
- Cool.
- Damn it.

12
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:25,250
Hold that thought.
I gotta go. Screen shot.

13
00:01:30,122 --> 00:01:32,391
- Looking good.
- We call those "ladies."

14
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:35,662
But of course, you wouldn't know that
because you've never been with one before.

15
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,362
Come on, man.

16
00:01:37,462 --> 00:01:41,167
That old hackers being nerds clichÃ©,
that's pretty dated now.

17
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,235
I do a'ight.

18
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,040
Okay, the encoded cell phone
is nearly done.

19
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,010
And all I gots to do is slap
a little Bone Machine on it.

20
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:57,115
Stop talking. Just get me a secure line.
And stop speaking to me as if I care.

21
00:01:58,215 --> 00:01:59,951
There you go.

22
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:03,221
God, I hate you so much.

23
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:06,292
Eavesdropping here.

24
00:02:12,497 --> 00:02:14,199
It's Griffin.

25
00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:18,304
You owe me a million dollars
and a sincere apology.

26
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:20,706
Antonio. What are you talking about?

27
00:02:20,806 --> 00:02:25,377
In the language of bribes,
taking the money equals "I accept."

28
00:02:25,477 --> 00:02:29,314
I see that you took the money,
so we have an implied agreement.

29
00:02:29,414 --> 00:02:33,151
The commissioner of ports
is a team player. Yay!

30
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:36,489
Then my shipment gets busted?
Come on. Boo.

31
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:40,026
Your shipment was held up 'cause I didn't
get the money. Thought you called it off.

32
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:43,363
- You had a job to do.
- I have a job to do when I get my...

33
00:02:45,063 --> 00:02:47,066
Is my guy there? Tell him to wait.

34
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,769
Wait! He said wait.
Antonio, listen, please.

35
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:53,038
- If I knew the deal was still on, I would...
- Put it on speaker, please.

36
00:02:54,906 --> 00:02:57,977
There. Now I feel like I'm participating.

37
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:01,514
Now... go for it.

38
00:03:05,383 --> 00:03:07,252
So, if he didn't get the money,

39
00:03:07,352 --> 00:03:10,889
find out who in my organization
stole from me and kill them.

40
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:12,992
Shit.

41
00:03:17,029 --> 00:03:20,100
Now, my little lovely, where were we?

42
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:03,376
I got my eye on our man, Troy.

43
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:07,379
That's the biggest MCAT dealer
south of Knoxville right there.

44
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:10,515
We got 100K in impound cash

45
00:04:10,615 --> 00:04:14,854
and a lieutenant with real trust issues.

46
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,355
This could get interesting.

47
00:04:16,455 --> 00:04:18,223
Ready, partner?

48
00:04:18,323 --> 00:04:20,826
All day, every day.

49
00:04:20,926 --> 00:04:22,929
Twice on Sundays.

50
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:28,401
Stay frosty out there, Mayfield.
This guy can be trigger happy.

51
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:31,603
Don't worry. I got your back.

52
00:04:31,703 --> 00:04:34,372
I got your back too, James.
Way before he had your back.

53
00:04:34,472 --> 00:04:38,244
What part of "Stay off the goddamn mike"
don't you understand, Ben?

54
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:40,879
You're just a beat cop
one month out the academy.

55
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,482
- You're lucky I let you shadow us.
Now shut up. - Copy that.

56
00:04:43,582 --> 00:04:47,620
Real quick, just before I start shadowing,
I don't know about this Mayfield guy.

57
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,122
I mean, he's big and all, and that's fine
if we trying to start a rap label.

58
00:04:51,222 --> 00:04:53,024
But we're here to be detectives.

59
00:04:53,124 --> 00:04:55,293
And you know what you need
to be a detective? A big brain.

60
00:04:55,393 --> 00:04:58,926
I'm not convinced you got a big brain
inside that tiny head.

61
00:04:59,026 --> 00:05:01,533
- So say you.
- It's a physiological impossibility.

62
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:03,903
Look who's breaking out
the double-point Scrabble words.

63
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:07,273
Everybody just be quiet.
And, Ben, stay off the goddamn radio.

64
00:05:13,712 --> 00:05:15,681
These are them now, boss.

65
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:22,120
- Got what we need?
- Cash first.

66
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,189
Must be a misunderstanding.

67
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:26,658
Look, we can do this two ways...

68
00:05:26,758 --> 00:05:31,664
Our way or the hard way.
Which is our way anyway.

69
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:37,270
Well, since you put it that way,
we got ourselves a deal.

70
00:05:42,073 --> 00:05:44,076
- Shit. It's a gun.
- Zoom in.

71
00:05:44,876 --> 00:05:47,812
- Guys, I'm coming out there right now.
- Sit tight. James' orders.

72
00:05:47,912 --> 00:05:51,116
You don't know James like I do.
That's the look of needing Ben.

73
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:54,319
He's shaking with terror!
That's my partner out there!

74
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,622
You hear me? I'm coming in hot!
Call it in.

75
00:05:57,722 --> 00:06:01,394
- Why you wanna go and do that? - Just hand
over that cash, and we got ourselves a deal.

76
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,563
- Are you sure you wanna go this route?
- I'm sure.

77
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:11,804
The hell?

78
00:06:23,442 --> 00:06:25,299
Oh, shit!

79
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:36,329
One second. Shit.

80
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,997
Sh... Come on, turn off.

81
00:06:39,097 --> 00:06:41,467
Goddamn it. Stop.

82
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,154
Did I interrupt something?

83
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,057
Did I break up your party?

84
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,492
Funny thing is,

85
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,661
I see all these muscle cars,

86
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,463
but I don't see no muscle.

87
00:07:11,563 --> 00:07:15,000
- Boss, you want me to put a slug in this one first?
- That supposed to scare me?

88
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,370
Let me ask you a question.
Would you be scared if you knew this?

89
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,110
That's that Muay Thai kicking back in.

90
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,079
Muscle memory. Unconscious.

91
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:29,549
Are you eyeballing me?

92
00:07:30,415 --> 00:07:32,151
You sneaking up on me?

93
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,520
'Cause this is all open.

94
00:07:36,821 --> 00:07:38,057
Kick move!

95
00:07:44,196 --> 00:07:46,166
Is that yours?

96
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,547
Mayfield!

97
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,687
I got you, James! Gimme... I got him!

98
00:08:09,787 --> 00:08:11,223
Foot chase!

99
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,560
Foot chase!

100
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,161
- Hey! Ben!
- Everybody move! Police!

101
00:08:19,505 --> 00:08:21,170
Oh, shit!

102
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:29,809
Damn pig.

103
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,821
Thanks for the ride.

104
00:08:45,624 --> 00:08:47,494
Hold on.

105
00:08:54,966 --> 00:08:55,801
Shit!

106
00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:01,907
God.

107
00:09:06,244 --> 00:09:07,345
Stop!

108
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:12,451
- Ben, move!
- You think I'm playing games?

109
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:13,920
Move!

110
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,422
No, he didn't!

111
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,633
James! Watch out! Watch out!

112
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,935
Shit!

113
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,664
James.

114
00:09:59,764 --> 00:10:02,567
- What, did we kill him?
- Just a little fender-bender.

115
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:03,936
Little fender-bender, my ass!

116
00:10:09,407 --> 00:10:10,676
Get up!

117
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,779
That's for shooting my partner.

118
00:10:14,713 --> 00:10:16,649
What you got here?

119
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,485
This looks like more than just drugs.

120
00:10:27,825 --> 00:10:30,696
Mayfield is out for weeks because of you,
and you bring him flowers?

121
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,782
It's a bad choice.

122
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:32,898
I disagree.

123
00:10:32,998 --> 00:10:36,434
- I'm the only one that got Mayfield something.
- You the one that got him shot!

124
00:10:36,534 --> 00:10:38,903
I went to the gift shop.
They had two choices.

125
00:10:39,003 --> 00:10:41,774
He's not pregnant, so I went with this.
It was a better fit.

126
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:43,509
- Just get rid of them.
- Fine.

127
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,778
Hey, man, congratulations.
Everybody heard about what you did.

128
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,614
- All right.
- What do you got?

129
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,517
Are you gonna head this one? Go, go.

130
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:53,485
Yeah.

131
00:10:53,585 --> 00:10:54,820
What you got for me?

132
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,889
I tried to get into this,
and it fried my computer.

133
00:10:57,989 --> 00:11:00,493
- It's like it's got acid for blood.
- Aliens.

134
00:11:03,428 --> 00:11:05,931
- Go.
- I've never seen a device locked this tight.

135
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:09,335
- Someone encrypted this to a level
we can't crack. - Hackers.

136
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:12,804
Like, freelance hackers.
Which would make a hacker a fracker.

137
00:11:12,904 --> 00:11:15,506
Do you ever listen to the shit
that fly out your mouth?

138
00:11:15,606 --> 00:11:18,876
- No.
- This is next-level hacking.

139
00:11:18,976 --> 00:11:22,748
The only way we got lucky is because
our guy has an ego and he left his tag.

140
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,850
- Who would do that?
- This guy, out of Miami.

141
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:28,419
He look like a low-budget-ass Jackie Chan.

142
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,955
- That was a good one.
- I know.

143
00:11:30,055 --> 00:11:31,956
And get this. His handle is Bone Machine.

144
00:11:32,056 --> 00:11:33,859
Let me talk to Brooks.

145
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,262
You want me to come with you?

146
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:36,695
No.

147
00:11:36,795 --> 00:11:39,865
So Troy is trying to become the new kingpin
of Atlanta, and what do you do?

148
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:43,869
Lose a hundred grand of the city's money, wind
up completely destroying a parking structure.

149
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:45,671
You get your partner shot? Nice.

150
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:48,006
Well, in his defense,
Mayfield wasn't his true partner.

151
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:49,741
The grown-ups are speaking, Ben.

152
00:11:49,841 --> 00:11:54,513
Get me something on this guy. I've got three,
maybe four days before I have to let him go.

153
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:58,017
I found a guy in Miami
that encrypted Troy's flash drive.

154
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,852
I think he can lead me to Troy's supplier.

155
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:05,057
I need to go down there and scoop
this dude up. Two days, tops. Milk run.

156
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,792
Good. So get a team together and fix this.

157
00:12:10,027 --> 00:12:12,730
What was that? Something went in there.

158
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,466
Did it get you too, or no?

159
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:17,469
Pollen or something. I don't know.

160
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:20,438
I'm free though, so if you guys
wanna put that team together...

161
00:12:20,538 --> 00:12:22,740
But you're not a detective, Ben.
You're barely even a probationary officer.

162
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,744
- After this mess, you're about an inch
from being fired. - Okay, listen.

163
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:27,645
Sir, you can't teach what I have.

164
00:12:27,745 --> 00:12:29,414
I'm like a cat.

165
00:12:29,514 --> 00:12:32,451
I'm like half cop, half puma,
but I'm all detective.

166
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:35,086
Like, I'll get in your ass.

167
00:12:35,186 --> 00:12:38,823
You know what? The psych department
wants me to take less responsibility.

168
00:12:38,923 --> 00:12:43,528
Mr. Barber here is still in his work placement,
so if you wanna take him to Miami you can.

169
00:12:43,628 --> 00:12:46,565
But if he screws up in any way,
it's on you.

170
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:47,966
Come on.

171
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:50,969
No. Everybody's busy. I'll fly solo.

172
00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:52,672
All right.

173
00:12:56,975 --> 00:13:00,913
What was that, man? You're supposed
to have my back back there, James.

174
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:03,948
- We family. Family's not supposed
to let shit go down... - Wait, stop. Stop.

175
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:07,919
It's not about family. It's not
about friends. It's not about feelings.

176
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:11,724
- It's about you not knowing how serious
this work is. - I know how serious this work is.

177
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:15,464
- That's why I know I need to be on the team.
- No, you don't. You're just a rookie.

178
00:13:15,564 --> 00:13:17,929
You got lucky
on your first little police case, man.

179
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:21,866
That was the worst thing to ever happen
to you. Turned you into a monster.

180
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:23,686
Now you think you're ready,
but you're not.

181
00:13:23,786 --> 00:13:25,537
James, I am ready, man!

182
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:28,841
You need to take me so I can prove it to you,
the lieutenant and everybody else.

183
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:31,876
You don't gotta prove nothing to me.
You almost got us killed.

184
00:13:31,976 --> 00:13:33,611
Don't let one incident define me.

185
00:13:33,711 --> 00:13:35,581
You trying to say that
with a straight face?

186
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,950
- Do you wanna be responsible for
ruining my career? - I don't care!

187
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,753
And you shouldn't either.
You're getting married in a week.

188
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,821
Stay here and help Angela
with the wedding.

189
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:45,923
You said it's a milk run. Two days, tops.
Those are your words.

190
00:13:46,023 --> 00:13:47,960
I can't go back to marry
Angela as no scrub.

191
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,764
You told me to prove myself.
That's what I'm trying to do! Let me do it!

192
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,565
Nope. You don't listen.

193
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:56,035
James, what I'm... Listen!

194
00:14:03,575 --> 00:14:07,145
It's bullshit, James,
not taking me to Miami.

195
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:09,081
That's ridiculous, man.

196
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,518
I am ready to be a detective.
I'm 100% ready.

197
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,119
What's up, Black Hammer?

198
00:14:14,219 --> 00:14:16,955
Move, AssFace. I'm not in the mood right now.
Y'all done made me mad.

199
00:14:17,055 --> 00:14:20,057
I'm-a show Lieutenant Brooks.
I'm-a show all y'all.

200
00:14:20,157 --> 00:14:23,595
People, get out of my way.
I'm getting in my zone.

201
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:27,166
I don't care. I'm-a show you
what happens when you chase me.

202
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,768
That's what happen when you
make Ben mad. Spin out.

203
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:32,937
And take it out.

204
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:36,041
- Yeah. I see a car I want. Get out the car.
- You need some help?

205
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:39,644
Get your Bengay-using ass out the car.
Get your old ass on that ground.

206
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:42,181
- This ain't a game to me.
- Bitch!

207
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:46,118
Where'd she get the bat from?
Grandma... Hey. Hey!

208
00:14:49,253 --> 00:14:52,691
- Grandma playing dirty.
- We turning it up now.

209
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,760
She pulled a gun out her ass?
Grandma, it ain't even got to go here.

210
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,730
I just got shot by a grandma!

211
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:02,801
That is why I hired you, Cori.
You're the best.

212
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:06,038
I know. We have 12 tables over here.

213
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:11,009
If we put flower arrangements at about half,
then we can do a vase with crystal around it.

214
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:13,044
- I love it.
- Cori?

215
00:15:13,144 --> 00:15:14,645
Ben.

216
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:16,615
I didn't know we were having
a meeting today.

217
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,750
I didn't get that memo.

218
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,086
We just thought we could do some
last-minute wedding details, that's all.

219
00:15:22,186 --> 00:15:25,157
W-without me?

220
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:30,696
Well, if that's the case,
then I'll just...

221
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:33,664
Listen from afar.

222
00:15:33,764 --> 00:15:35,100
Hmph.

223
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,369
Thank you, Ben.

224
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:37,668
Yep.

225
00:15:37,768 --> 00:15:40,038
I am so excited to tell you,

226
00:15:40,138 --> 00:15:44,509
my associate has the best hydrangea
connection in all of Atlanta.

227
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:46,044
No.

228
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:51,216
For the final seating chart,
I've decided to move everyone to table five

229
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:53,951
because I don't want anything
overshadowing your wedding.

230
00:15:54,051 --> 00:15:55,953
- Perfect.
- Table five, that's the perfect table.

231
00:15:56,053 --> 00:15:57,339
No, we can't sit them there.

232
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,756
Why?

233
00:15:58,856 --> 00:16:02,594
We can't put my uncle and Carol at the same
table. They used to be on that stuff together.

234
00:16:02,694 --> 00:16:04,929
You want all these people Electric Sliding
all night? That's what'll happen.

235
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:07,099
Fine. I'll move him. But...

236
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,634
Angela, no! You're not moving anyone.

237
00:16:09,734 --> 00:16:12,671
Ben. You've had your opportunity.

238
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:15,706
And you've ignored them all.
Let me ask you a question.

239
00:16:15,806 --> 00:16:19,644
Have you looked at my Dreamboard I posted
online? My color wheel? My glam shots?

240
00:16:19,744 --> 00:16:23,115
Why am I going back and forth with you?
This is my wedding!

241
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,149
And I got a vision for my wedding.

242
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:28,320
A magnificent vision
that will not be ignored by you.

243
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,606
She's not ignoring.

244
00:16:29,706 --> 00:16:30,923
Baby, she is ignoring it.

245
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,557
- She hasn't addressed it.
- Excuse me.

246
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:34,192
What are you all walkin' up,
all swellin' up?

247
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:37,696
Do you know the level
of who you're dealing with?

248
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:39,697
I'm a first-ballot hall of famer.

249
00:16:39,797 --> 00:16:42,600
- I crap out high-end clients.
- That's a little too much information for me.

250
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,238
And they keep coming back.
Why? Because I have taste.

251
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:50,008
I'm not gonna do this with you.
The reason why is because...

252
00:16:50,108 --> 00:16:52,844
Just help me up.
I'm not intimidated by you.

253
00:16:52,944 --> 00:16:56,648
I'm a cop. Real badge. Authentic.
What you gonna do is respect it.

254
00:16:56,748 --> 00:16:59,618
Also respect the fact
that you are my employee!

255
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:00,751
- Your employee?
- That's right.

256
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:01,804
Don't you step...

257
00:17:01,904 --> 00:17:02,888
Look, cop.

258
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,824
What you need to do is,
you need to step the hell back

259
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:08,626
and let me create
the wedding of your dreams!

260
00:17:08,726 --> 00:17:10,895
What I'm gonna do is step up!

261
00:17:10,995 --> 00:17:12,831
- No!
- I'm sick of this shit.

262
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,201
Ben.

263
00:17:17,301 --> 00:17:19,371
So I guess we'll go with my vision now.

264
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:22,340
Get out of my house, Cori!

265
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,144
Look, just let Cori do her job,
which is to plan the wedding.

266
00:17:26,244 --> 00:17:28,747
Cori's job should be
to show a little respect.

267
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,916
I specifically told Cori,
I said, "No hydrangeas."

268
00:17:32,016 --> 00:17:34,318
And what does she show up
here with? Hydrangeas!

269
00:17:34,418 --> 00:17:36,855
I keep forgetting that you're the bride.

270
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,856
Why does nobody want to show me respect?

271
00:17:38,956 --> 00:17:40,993
That's what I wanna know, Ange.

272
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,731
I respect you.

273
00:17:46,831 --> 00:17:50,735
Well, obviously not, because we're sitting
here talking about my passion and...

274
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,705
I respect that.

275
00:17:54,805 --> 00:17:57,976
I do. A lot.

276
00:17:58,076 --> 00:17:59,744
Practice run for the wedding night?

277
00:17:59,844 --> 00:18:02,413
Yeah. I mean, we're here.

278
00:18:02,513 --> 00:18:05,282
I'm taking you into custody.

279
00:18:05,382 --> 00:18:08,019
You are going down...

280
00:18:08,786 --> 00:18:10,188
town.

281
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:12,857
Well, I like that.
'Cause of the play on words.

282
00:18:12,957 --> 00:18:14,425
Yeah... What are you...

283
00:18:14,525 --> 00:18:18,063
What is that? What you trying to do?
No, stop. Don't do that.

284
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,698
Stop.

285
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:22,166
You have the right to stay silent.

286
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:24,068
You have the right to remain silent.

287
00:18:24,168 --> 00:18:26,337
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything...

288
00:18:26,437 --> 00:18:29,740
Let me stop you right here.
I want you to Mirandize me.

289
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,277
I want you to Mirandize
the hell out of me.

290
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:36,882
But first I need to go in that bathroom
and wash all this Atlanta crime off my butt.

291
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:39,817
When I'm done, I'm-a come out clean
and give myself to the law.

292
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:41,386
Take me. Handcuff me to the bed.

293
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,423
Babe, put that baton down.
You break it, I'm-a have to pay for it.

294
00:18:45,523 --> 00:18:48,292
What is going on in my stomach?
I gotta get in the bathroom.

295
00:18:51,295 --> 00:18:53,131
Okay.

296
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,367
Hey, Sis. Everything okay?

297
00:18:56,467 --> 00:19:00,005
I need you to do something for me,
for the wedding.

298
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:02,307
If this is about me not bringing a date...

299
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,442
That's not what I'm calling you about.

300
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:08,446
I was wondering, did you get me
a gift for the wedding yet?

301
00:19:08,546 --> 00:19:10,449
Sound like you want a favor.

302
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,317
Ange!

303
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,486
Ben really wants to go to Miami.

304
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,406
He told me you wouldn't take him.

305
00:19:16,506 --> 00:19:18,355
Hell no. You crazy?

306
00:19:18,455 --> 00:19:21,826
- It would mean so much to him.
- I don't care what it'd mean to him.

307
00:19:21,926 --> 00:19:25,363
Look, is this about him or about you
getting him out of your hair for a few days?

308
00:19:25,463 --> 00:19:26,582
Ange!

309
00:19:26,682 --> 00:19:27,833
A little bit of both.

310
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:31,036
No can do, Sis. Get the dwarf a sedative.

311
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:34,038
- He's not going with me. This is way too important.
- He just wants to prove himself.

312
00:19:34,138 --> 00:19:36,240
The answer is no.

313
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,875
Hello?

314
00:19:37,975 --> 00:19:40,244
This girl crazy.

315
00:19:40,344 --> 00:19:43,981
Now, why would you want me
to take this little flea to Miami?

316
00:19:44,081 --> 00:19:46,886
To show what kind of a idiot he i...

317
00:19:57,361 --> 00:19:59,396
Baby?

318
00:19:59,496 --> 00:20:00,865
- Baby!
- Yeah?

319
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:02,867
The door. Someone's at the door.

320
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:05,436
All right. They'll go away, Ange.

321
00:20:05,536 --> 00:20:08,306
No, they're not. They're not going away.

322
00:20:16,247 --> 00:20:19,250
I learned my lesson. I didn't break in.

323
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:22,453
- I see that, James.
- At least not this time.

324
00:20:22,553 --> 00:20:24,556
What are you wearing?

325
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:28,926
"What am I wearing?" It's called a kimono,
James. They make them for men.

326
00:20:29,026 --> 00:20:31,128
You need to expand your horizons.

327
00:20:31,228 --> 00:20:34,199
Well, just please don't bring
this bullshit to Miami with us.

328
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,167
Well, I won't br...

329
00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:39,171
Wait a minute. Hold on.
Miami, James? I'm going?

330
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:42,574
- You taking me to Miami?
- I'm leaving in 5 minutes. You better hurry up.

331
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,409
Come here, man.

332
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:47,311
All right. It's too soon.
Baby steps. I'm okay with that.

333
00:20:47,411 --> 00:20:48,931
I knew you were gonna change your mind,

334
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:52,216
'cause when we were talking,
you looked at me like...

335
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:57,388
And I was like, "He's thinking about it."
You were mulling it over.

336
00:20:57,488 --> 00:20:59,057
I'm pumped up.

337
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:01,026
Okay.

338
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,260
This is a little awkward, babe.

339
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:09,067
James wants me to go away with him for
a couple days on official police business.

340
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,969
I don't wanna go. I don't.

341
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:12,570
But James needs me.

342
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,373
Okay, yeah. Baby, do what you need to do.

343
00:21:15,473 --> 00:21:16,674
- Really?
- Yeah.

344
00:21:16,774 --> 00:21:19,877
Just make sure you're back in time
to make me Mrs. Black Hammer.

345
00:21:19,977 --> 00:21:23,080
Yes! Of course! I can't wait to get back.

346
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:26,917
Because as soon as I get here, you and I,
we are gonna marry the hell out of each other.

347
00:21:27,017 --> 00:21:29,487
We are gonna marry our asses off. Okay?

348
00:21:29,587 --> 00:21:31,455
Give me three.

349
00:21:31,555 --> 00:21:32,923
I love you. All right.

350
00:21:33,023 --> 00:21:35,227
You! Hey, what can I say?

351
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:36,745
You just... Miami!

352
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:41,098
- Hurry up.
- I'm hurrying.

353
00:21:41,198 --> 00:21:43,367
Don't think I'm not grateful.

354
00:21:43,467 --> 00:21:45,269
But why did you change your mind?

355
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:47,873
Ben is never gonna make detective.

356
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,307
And everybody on the force knows this.

357
00:21:50,407 --> 00:21:55,180
But he thinks if he makes this Miami run
with me that he'll prove us all wrong.

358
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,148
So I'm taking him
so he can see for hisself.

359
00:21:58,248 --> 00:22:01,219
'Cause I don't wanna hear him
complaining for the rest of my life

360
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:03,254
that I never gave him a chance.

361
00:22:04,455 --> 00:22:06,657
You never know. He may surprise you.

362
00:22:06,757 --> 00:22:08,292
- I doubt it.
- He's done it before.

363
00:22:08,392 --> 00:22:09,695
Beginner's luck.

364
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,128
Okay.

365
00:22:11,228 --> 00:22:12,963
You'll be careful, right?

366
00:22:13,063 --> 00:22:16,367
Don't worry. I'll have your little man child
back here safe and sound.

367
00:22:16,467 --> 00:22:18,236
He's all man.

368
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:19,904
- Hey, Ange?
- Yeah, babe?

369
00:22:20,004 --> 00:22:22,374
- You know where my thong is?
- The silver or the gold?

370
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:25,175
- The silver one.
- Check my top right drawer.

371
00:22:25,275 --> 00:22:27,378
Don't mix up our thongs again.

372
00:22:27,478 --> 00:22:28,480
I'm out.

373
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,614
I got 'em.

374
00:22:29,714 --> 00:22:33,085
- They were in my panty drawer, not yours.
Thank you. - You're welcome!

375
00:22:44,495 --> 00:22:45,696
Whoo! James!

376
00:22:54,438 --> 00:22:57,342
Look at this, man! James, do you see this?

377
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:59,576
This is Miami! The 305!

378
00:22:59,676 --> 00:23:01,445
Remember, this ain't no vacation.

379
00:23:01,545 --> 00:23:05,150
First thing we gonna do is go by Miami PD,
let them know we here.

380
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,986
You can't just slide in somebody's
backyard, start doing police work

381
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:10,020
without letting them know you in town.

382
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,657
- If that's the case, we gotta stop so I can change.
- Why? What's the reason?

383
00:23:25,302 --> 00:23:27,172
This is just wrong.

384
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:29,673
If linen is wrong, I don't wanna be right.

385
00:23:29,773 --> 00:23:32,609
- You look like you're in a damn cult.
- Tommy Bahama run a cult?

386
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:35,380
If so, good. Where can I sign up?

387
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,648
If we're gonna be a team,
you gotta coordinate.

388
00:23:37,748 --> 00:23:41,152
Listen to me, James.
We gotta complement each other.

389
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:42,854
I'm not trying to complement
no marshmallow.

390
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:46,290
A good detective knows how to blend in with
the locals so his prey never sees him coming.

391
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,093
Yeah, you blending, all right.

392
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:53,498
The right gust of wind hit this thing,
I'm giving you '90s P. Diddy.

393
00:24:03,511 --> 00:24:05,661
- All right, wait here.
- Why I gotta wait here?

394
00:24:05,761 --> 00:24:07,411
Why you gotta talk?

395
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:12,217
Detective, I'm asking nicely.

396
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:14,253
Please. I need a suspect.

397
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,189
You're the Atlanta fella.

398
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:20,525
Captain Pedro Hernandez.
Honored to meet you.

399
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,694
Detective James Payton.
We just wanted to give you a heads-up.

400
00:24:23,794 --> 00:24:26,798
We're gonna be working in your jurisdiction,
questioning a possible witness.

401
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:28,699
Thanks for the heads-up.

402
00:24:32,369 --> 00:24:33,604
What? Hydrangeas?

403
00:24:43,881 --> 00:24:47,152
- What's up with this? - The Antonio
Pope Foundation's annual fund-raiser.

404
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:50,288
That's Antonio himself. He's a big donor.

405
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:52,858
He owns one of the largest shipping
companies on the East Coast.

406
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,733
- What is your problem?
- You're at my desk.

407
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:04,769
- I'm sorry. I'm just looking at some
floral arrangements. - Well, don't.

408
00:25:04,869 --> 00:25:07,806
Don't touch my computer. Don't look
at my computer. This stuff is sensitive.

409
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,574
That is fine. I'll log out.

410
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,776
- You're gonna log out?
- Girl!

411
00:25:11,876 --> 00:25:14,244
I said don't touch!

412
00:25:14,344 --> 00:25:17,615
- It hurts. I know.
- James!

413
00:25:17,715 --> 00:25:20,285
Soft-tissue manipulation.

414
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:22,153
Pressure points.

415
00:25:22,253 --> 00:25:25,256
- You should be able to get out of that.
- She got my appendix, James.

416
00:25:25,356 --> 00:25:27,625
- She locked this whole side up.
- Can he get out of this?

417
00:25:27,725 --> 00:25:30,828
I don't know about that one.

418
00:25:30,928 --> 00:25:33,664
Come on, Ben.
You're embarrassing me. Man up.

419
00:25:33,764 --> 00:25:35,432
- Yeah, you're embarrassing him.
- You're pathetic.

420
00:25:35,532 --> 00:25:38,403
- I tap out!
- Detective Payton, Atlanta Vice.

421
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:41,239
- Down here a couple of days on assignment.
- My hat!

422
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:42,875
Detective Cruz. Homicide.

423
00:25:45,376 --> 00:25:48,579
- I'm Officer Ben Barber, and I am his partner.
- No, he's not.

424
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:51,348
I'm not shaking your hand after that.

425
00:25:51,448 --> 00:25:55,286
Come on, James.
Let's go before I have to bust her ass.

426
00:25:55,386 --> 00:25:57,821
Come on, James. 'Cause she's too much.

427
00:25:57,921 --> 00:26:00,825
Don't know what her problem is.

428
00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:15,772
James, it's really cool that you need me
to come down here and all.

429
00:26:15,872 --> 00:26:19,477
But I feel bad 'cause then you
had to cancel all your plans.

430
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:20,563
What plans?

431
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:21,679
My bachelor party.

432
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:23,847
- I didn't have nothin' planned.
- Yeah, right.

433
00:26:23,947 --> 00:26:26,416
Boy, if you don't stop...

434
00:26:26,516 --> 00:26:28,886
Seriously, you didn't have anything?
Nothing? You...

435
00:26:30,788 --> 00:26:33,391
James, I'm not even into that...
strippers and...

436
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:36,760
I'm not trying to come home
to the Lady Hammer with glitter all on me.

437
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:40,531
Hey, Angela need to know
who you're bringing to the wedding.

438
00:26:40,631 --> 00:26:44,736
Either, Nicki Minaj or Patti LaBelle.

439
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:46,938
You know what you're doing?
You're road-blocking.

440
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:51,375
That's what you're doing, man. You're still
holding on to something. I know what it is.

441
00:26:51,475 --> 00:26:55,779
You're afraid that when me and Angela sail off
into the sunset, you're gonna be by yourself.

442
00:26:55,879 --> 00:26:59,416
But here's the thing, James. You can
sail off into the sunset with me and Angela.

443
00:26:59,516 --> 00:27:02,220
After the honeymoon though.
You can't go there.

444
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,721
'Cause that's when me
and Angela gets busy.

445
00:27:04,821 --> 00:27:08,226
You say that one more time,
I'm-a shoot you in the face.

446
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:11,895
Again, it doesn't bother me. You know why,
James? Because it's just banter.

447
00:27:11,995 --> 00:27:14,898
- Is that right?
- It's a trademark of all great partnerships.

448
00:27:14,998 --> 00:27:17,801
No, no. It's a trademark
of the brothers-in-law.

449
00:27:17,901 --> 00:27:21,306
Guess who just showed up.

450
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:22,839
The brothers-in-law.

451
00:27:22,939 --> 00:27:24,608
Look, man. That ain't gonna fly.

452
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:26,611
One more, one more.

453
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:29,580
Everybody settle down! Because
the brothers-in-law just got to town.

454
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,750
You say that again,
and I'm-a shoot you in the face too.

455
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,988
You... All right, fine.

456
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,199
You funny.

457
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:48,766
It's gonna stick.

458
00:27:57,608 --> 00:28:00,244
All right.

459
00:28:00,344 --> 00:28:03,347
How you wanna handle
this whole thing with A.J.?

460
00:28:03,447 --> 00:28:05,817
Wanna do Good Cop-Bad Cop?
Prisoner's Dilemma?

461
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:08,353
Leave that by-the-book shit
at the academy.

462
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:12,022
We're gonna assess the situation
and play it on instincts... my instincts.

463
00:28:12,122 --> 00:28:14,992
With all due respect, we should do
the Reid technique. I done studied it.

464
00:28:15,092 --> 00:28:18,863
Why don't we try the "Ben, shut the hell up"
technique? Let's run that all day.

465
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,632
A.J., open up!

466
00:28:21,898 --> 00:28:23,901
I'm gonna go check around the window.

467
00:28:30,574 --> 00:28:32,710
Hey! Police! Stop! You better stop!

468
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,878
James! He running!

469
00:28:34,978 --> 00:28:36,881
- That's a foot chase!
- Don't say foot...

470
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,049
It's a foot chase!

471
00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:41,986
It's a foot chase, James!
Stop right there!

472
00:28:42,086 --> 00:28:44,288
- You ain't gotta say "Foot chase!"
- Stop!

473
00:28:44,388 --> 00:28:45,722
Hey! Relax!

474
00:28:45,822 --> 00:28:47,892
James! I'm okay!

475
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:50,628
What'd I say?

476
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,531
Police! Stop!

477
00:28:54,631 --> 00:28:56,935
Slow down! Shit!

478
00:28:58,569 --> 00:29:00,872
Police! Stop! Hey! Stop!

479
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:03,108
Stop! Stop!

480
00:29:04,475 --> 00:29:07,010
Police!

481
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,348
Goddamn rookie.

482
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,319
Enjoy your barbecue!

483
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:16,987
Get down! I see you! Stop!

484
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,500
Police, stop!

485
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,936
That's it! I'm-a shoot you!

486
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,609
A.J.! A.J., don't you jump...

487
00:29:39,042 --> 00:29:40,877
Damn it!

488
00:29:40,977 --> 00:29:42,613
A.J.!

489
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:51,889
I got you, A.J.!

490
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:55,960
Goddamn it, I missed.

491
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,862
You'll be okay. Doesn't look that bad!

492
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,965
A.J., get your ass... A.J.!

493
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,601
A.J.!

494
00:30:07,905 --> 00:30:10,041
Get in that room.

495
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:16,548
Stop! Stop!

496
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:20,852
Stop! Stop!

497
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:22,886
Shit!

498
00:30:22,986 --> 00:30:25,956
Heel! Heel!

499
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:30,128
Police!

500
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,968
Goddamn it.

501
00:30:41,886 --> 00:30:44,152
Shit! Shit!

502
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:46,811
Get out of here! Get out!

503
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:59,790
A.J. You okay, man?

504
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,792
Damn, I didn't see you.

505
00:31:01,892 --> 00:31:04,127
It's all right. This is my friend.
We just playing.

506
00:31:04,227 --> 00:31:06,130
He's okay. We just playing.

507
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,566
What's up, Bone Machine?
What you running from?

508
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:11,001
- Why you chasing me?
- Why you running from the police?

509
00:31:11,101 --> 00:31:12,936
I didn't know you were "po-lice."

510
00:31:13,036 --> 00:31:14,971
You didn't hear us say,
"Stop! We the police"?

511
00:31:15,071 --> 00:31:16,740
Hey. I didn't see a badge.

512
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,977
All I saw was two
mean-looking bla... entlemen.

513
00:31:20,077 --> 00:31:23,881
"Blentlemen"? That ain't even a word, A.J.
What you trying to say, man?

514
00:31:23,981 --> 00:31:27,018
- Just forget about it.
- Say what you mean. Have some balls! Say it!

515
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:30,188
Okay. Black.

516
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:33,557
You ran from us just 'cause we black?

517
00:31:33,657 --> 00:31:35,792
Look at you.

518
00:31:35,892 --> 00:31:38,128
You would run from you. Okay?

519
00:31:38,228 --> 00:31:41,766
Look, all we wanna do is talk to you, A.J.

520
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:46,770
You and your son over there should be ashamed
of yourselves for trying to intimidate me!

521
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:49,140
You can't hear me calling you?
Running after you in flats?

522
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,175
- Ben! What are you doing?
- He got me running through alleyways!

523
00:31:52,275 --> 00:31:55,779
People's houses! Chasing you
through chicken coops and dogs and shit!

524
00:31:55,879 --> 00:31:59,217
In flats, James? Look at my outfit.
I can't get another one of these.

525
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,685
- Where's my hat at?
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey. Come here.

526
00:32:01,785 --> 00:32:05,222
Stay focused. Stay focused. Let me show
you how a real detective handles this.

527
00:32:06,323 --> 00:32:07,991
Damn.

528
00:32:08,091 --> 00:32:11,261
A.J., look, man.

529
00:32:11,361 --> 00:32:16,032
All we trying to do is have a little
conversation about your boy Troy in Atlanta.

530
00:32:16,132 --> 00:32:17,986
Troy who?

531
00:32:18,086 --> 00:32:19,971
You just encrypted a drive for Troy.

532
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:23,574
Troy? I-It doesn't ring a bell.
I don't know any Troy.

533
00:32:23,674 --> 00:32:24,777
It don't ring a bell?

534
00:32:24,877 --> 00:32:26,009
No, it does not.

535
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:28,945
- I'm taking your ass to jail.
- Come on, man!

536
00:32:29,045 --> 00:32:32,950
Until you let me know what's on that secret
drive of Troy's, your ass is locked up.

537
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:35,819
My word is my rep. And this is oppression.

538
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,589
Get your ass in there.

539
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:42,226
Why you lookin' so nervous, A.J.?

540
00:32:42,326 --> 00:32:44,694
- Why your legs so twitchy?
- Got restless leg syndrome.

541
00:32:44,794 --> 00:32:47,731
Your legs won't rest when you get to jail.

542
00:32:47,831 --> 00:32:51,269
They gonna be working overtime to
keep them "blentlemen" off your back.

543
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,905
Last thing they're gonna do
with your ass is be "blentle."

544
00:32:55,005 --> 00:32:58,009
I am not a criminal, and you know that.

545
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:01,244
- This is not fair!
- It's not fair? Welcome to the real world.

546
00:33:01,344 --> 00:33:05,082
I'm sorry it's not fair here. You know why?
It's a world where your feelings can get hurt.

547
00:33:05,182 --> 00:33:08,553
It's a world where a guy can get married
and not be thrown a bachelor party.

548
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,886
- You getting married?
- Yes.

549
00:33:09,986 --> 00:33:11,622
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

550
00:33:11,722 --> 00:33:14,258
This guy here is about to
be my brother... in-law.

551
00:33:14,358 --> 00:33:17,994
Your partner is marrying your sister?

552
00:33:18,094 --> 00:33:19,397
He's not my partner.

553
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,830
That's gotta be weird.

554
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:23,601
It's not weird at all. It's actually magical.
Brings us closer together.

555
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:27,038
- Ben. Stay focused.
- What makes you think I'm not focused?

556
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:29,740
- Let me ask you a question.
- Go ahead.

557
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,076
- Your girl. His sister.
- Yeah?

558
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:36,747
She hefty? I hope she's not a twin,
all bearded and grumpy.

559
00:33:36,847 --> 00:33:39,049
No, they don't look alike.

560
00:33:39,149 --> 00:33:42,787
My whole point is, your partner marrying
your sister has got to be tough on you.

561
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:45,623
The sex part. Think about it.

562
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:48,025
Your partner, boning...

563
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:50,294
- No, we don't bone.
- ...your sister.

564
00:33:50,394 --> 00:33:52,797
Don't... That's not... No.

565
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:55,166
- A.J., you better cool out.
- Me so horny.

566
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:58,669
- Geez!
- Been there.

567
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:01,672
I think you broke my nose.

568
00:34:01,772 --> 00:34:05,942
That's a lawsuit right there!
You just made me a very rich man!

569
00:34:06,042 --> 00:34:08,713
- Can't spend no money in the pen. Or dead.
- No.

570
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:12,083
- What's it gonna be?
- Okay, okay.

571
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:16,152
I may have a master code key
for emergencies.

572
00:34:16,252 --> 00:34:18,088
- You "may"?
- Okay. I do have one.

573
00:34:18,188 --> 00:34:21,958
But it's too dangerous to keep on me.
I keep it in my man Stevie B's safe.

574
00:34:22,058 --> 00:34:24,128
Where's the safe?

575
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,396
It's at the club he owns. Tell you what.

576
00:34:26,496 --> 00:34:30,101
I get that for you, you can crack
Troy's computer and we're good.

577
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:33,737
What you think?
Sound like a plan to me, James.

578
00:34:40,143 --> 00:34:41,846
- Have you been watching this?
- What?

579
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:44,715
Since we walked in, everybody
he walk by, handshake or hug.

580
00:34:44,815 --> 00:34:46,349
- Hey, Candi.
- Hi, sweetie.

581
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:48,018
- How are you?
- Fine.

582
00:34:48,118 --> 00:34:49,119
Usual table?

583
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:51,688
And please tell the guys that

584
00:34:51,788 --> 00:34:53,724
midnight is coming early tonight.

585
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,092
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

586
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,969
I know that look.

587
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:07,371
"How come the nerd
is with all the hotties?"

588
00:35:07,471 --> 00:35:11,074
Well, anyway, Stevie B's gonna
be here in an hour, tops.

589
00:35:11,174 --> 00:35:16,047
You said you didn't get a bachelor party,
and we are in a club with ladies.

590
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:19,784
And we are on official
police business, so...

591
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:23,119
You want to look like cops? Think about it.
Maybe scare my guy off?

592
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:25,989
James, I hate to agree with A.J.,
but he's got a point.

593
00:35:26,089 --> 00:35:29,059
- Loosen up a little bit.
- Yeah!

594
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:32,262
- Hey, where you going?
- I'm-a get some drinks, man. Chillax.

595
00:35:32,362 --> 00:35:35,699
What is your problem? If he wanna
get us a couple of drinks, let him!

596
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:38,768
He is working you like a rookie,
and if you lose him, it's your fault.

597
00:35:38,868 --> 00:35:41,005
Stop it. You don't think I know that?

598
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:44,407
Here's the play, James.
We sit here until his friend gets here.

599
00:35:44,507 --> 00:35:47,811
We act as if this is a bachelor party,
let him get loose,

600
00:35:47,911 --> 00:35:49,780
get the information
we need and then we leave.

601
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,916
Key word is "act."

602
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:53,918
- That's what you're doing?
- I'm acting.

603
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,321
It's my bachelor party!

604
00:36:10,366 --> 00:36:12,969
I got you! I got him!

605
00:36:13,069 --> 00:36:16,172
One more time! One more time!

606
00:36:16,272 --> 00:36:17,908
One more time!

607
00:36:24,581 --> 00:36:27,083
Wait a minute.

608
00:36:27,183 --> 00:36:28,485
What's happening, Black Hammer?

609
00:36:28,585 --> 00:36:30,019
- AssFace!
- Hey!

610
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:31,322
- What?
- What are you doing?

611
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:34,759
- Skyping in the rest of the bachelor party!
- Get off the table!

612
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,159
I'm acting.

613
00:36:36,259 --> 00:36:39,963
Ben, I want you to meet
my new lady friends.

614
00:36:40,063 --> 00:36:41,931
They love to get loose and party,

615
00:36:42,031 --> 00:36:44,101
but they are not prostitutes.

616
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:46,971
- It's his bachelor party.
- Let it rip.

617
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:49,405
No, that's too much, ladies. Hands off.

618
00:36:49,505 --> 00:36:51,474
- Hey, Ben, take a photo for me?
- Okay.

619
00:36:51,574 --> 00:36:54,778
- One, two... - I can't breathe no more.
I can't breathe no more.

620
00:36:54,878 --> 00:36:55,980
I got it.

621
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,920
Go ahead.

622
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,322
Ange is such a strong woman.

623
00:37:05,422 --> 00:37:08,125
I don't wanna give her anything
that's girly or ratchet.

624
00:37:08,225 --> 00:37:10,360
Nobody's information is safe
unless A.J. makes it safe.

625
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,463
That's a great idea!

626
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,798
- A.J.
- Hey, hey, hey.

627
00:37:14,898 --> 00:37:17,434
- Where is Stevie B? We need to find him!
- You're ruining my clothes.

628
00:37:17,534 --> 00:37:19,103
I'm sick of waiting on you.

629
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:21,172
We gotta toast the groom. Toast! Toast!

630
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:24,507
Toast! Toast! Toast! Toast! Toast!

631
00:37:24,607 --> 00:37:27,911
Would it kill you to say
something nice about me?

632
00:37:28,011 --> 00:37:29,280
- You want a toast?
- Yes!

633
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,081
- All right. Give me my water.
- Here!

634
00:37:32,181 --> 00:37:36,085
I've never gotten him to do anything
like this. Come on. Let's hear it!

635
00:37:36,185 --> 00:37:39,088
- To my brother-in-law, Benjamin Barber.
- That's me.

636
00:37:39,188 --> 00:37:42,893
He's 5'4". Gonna marry my sister.

637
00:37:42,993 --> 00:37:45,061
Just graduated from the academy.

638
00:37:45,161 --> 00:37:48,198
You're not doing anything but stating facts.

639
00:37:51,234 --> 00:37:53,570
Guys, do you know what time it is?

640
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:57,007
It's midnight!

641
00:37:57,107 --> 00:37:58,442
Whoo!

642
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:00,210
Bachelor party!

643
00:38:09,652 --> 00:38:11,154
- What?
- He's gone!

644
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:15,626
Excuse me, ladies! Shit.

645
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:18,128
I'll give the money back! I swear!

646
00:38:18,228 --> 00:38:20,598
Easy, dude!

647
00:38:22,232 --> 00:38:23,634
Gun! Gun!

648
00:38:29,973 --> 00:38:32,476
Freeze!

649
00:38:34,344 --> 00:38:36,880
Everybody down! Down! Get down!

650
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,249
Get up, A.J.! Get your ass up!

651
00:38:47,424 --> 00:38:50,427
- Every time I go to a club with you,
I get into trouble. - It's probably that jacket.

652
00:38:50,527 --> 00:38:53,496
He's shooting a FN 5.7, James!
That gun is serious!

653
00:38:53,596 --> 00:38:56,166
- I'm-a push him back.
- Don't go now.

654
00:38:56,266 --> 00:38:58,601
- Too many people!
- Told you not to go!

655
00:38:58,701 --> 00:39:01,271
- Thirteen. Fourteen.
- What are you counting?

656
00:39:01,371 --> 00:39:02,973
He's out!

657
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,150
Everybody stay down! Stay down!

658
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:15,085
A.J.

659
00:39:19,723 --> 00:39:21,324
What?

660
00:39:21,424 --> 00:39:22,659
He's gone.

661
00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:27,563
Hey.

662
00:39:27,663 --> 00:39:30,199
There was no code key in the damn safe.

663
00:39:30,299 --> 00:39:32,202
A.J. played us.

664
00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:35,438
You okay?

665
00:39:35,538 --> 00:39:38,108
No. No, I am not.

666
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:41,378
Let me ask you a serious question.
Maybe you not cut out for this.

667
00:39:41,478 --> 00:39:43,646
That's not a question. It's a statement.

668
00:39:43,746 --> 00:39:47,050
You was having such a good time at your
bachelor party, you wasn't even ready.

669
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:49,685
First of all, don't act like
I wanted to go to this club

670
00:39:49,785 --> 00:39:53,157
and stand on tables and party
with a bunch of hot women.

671
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:55,192
That didn't come out right.
I'm gonna start over.

672
00:40:03,299 --> 00:40:06,402
My God. Detective by day, hottie by night.

673
00:40:06,502 --> 00:40:09,405
- What the hell's going on? - I'll tell you
what's not going on... a Pilates class.

674
00:40:09,505 --> 00:40:12,509
Don't know what you're dressed for,
but it's stupid.

675
00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:14,610
- What happened?
- One shooter.

676
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:17,715
Obviously a professional.
Went right after A.J.

677
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:21,284
- Who the hell is A.J.? - A.J.'s the hacker
that we came out here to question.

678
00:40:21,384 --> 00:40:25,155
Now, your guys think it's gang-related.
I say that's bullshit.

679
00:40:25,255 --> 00:40:28,559
- Because you're an expert on local gangs?
- I'm an expert on bullshit.

680
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:31,262
- Well, expert, how'd he get the gun in?
- Gun was ceramic.

681
00:40:32,295 --> 00:40:33,998
Or plastic. I saw it.

682
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,099
It was a FN 5.7. It's undetectable.

683
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:40,670
It's a downloadable super pack on my video
game. You get that pack, game over!

684
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:42,706
That's how he got the gun in.

685
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:46,309
The case I'm working on right now?

686
00:40:46,409 --> 00:40:49,413
Shooter got a gun inside of a secured area.
And get this.

687
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:54,550
The threads on the bullet
matched the casings of an FN 5.7.

688
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:56,619
Same MO. Could be the same shooter.

689
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:58,089
- Who was shot?
- Port commissioner.

690
00:40:59,822 --> 00:41:02,358
Could be connected.

691
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:05,295
It's like watching rams mate.

692
00:41:05,395 --> 00:41:08,431
Why would somebody hire
a professional hit man

693
00:41:08,531 --> 00:41:10,434
to take out a computer guy

694
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:12,568
for a mid-level Atlanta dealer?

695
00:41:12,668 --> 00:41:16,206
- 'Cause he's annoying. - If that was
the case, you'd be dead a long time ago.

696
00:41:16,306 --> 00:41:19,175
- I'm just spitballing.
- Fact is, he wouldn't.

697
00:41:19,275 --> 00:41:23,079
So the guy who hit the port commissioner is
the same guy who tried to hit your hacker.

698
00:41:23,179 --> 00:41:25,782
Maybe he's involved with something bigger.

699
00:41:25,882 --> 00:41:29,186
You know what? She should be
your "plus-one" for the wedding.

700
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:32,056
- Get in the car.
- I need to get somebody for you.

701
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:35,125
- Get in the car.
- You wanna just have an empty plate there...

702
00:41:35,225 --> 00:41:39,195
I'm not gonna keep doing this. There's so
much disrespect. What's funny to me, James?

703
00:41:39,295 --> 00:41:42,298
The plastic gun? I detected that.
But you don't say nothing about that, do you?

704
00:41:42,398 --> 00:41:45,436
- A professional hitter on a hacker?
- Club full of witnesses?

705
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,070
- I'm driving.
- No, you're not.

706
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:49,539
I'm in the driver's seat, James,
which means I'm driving.

707
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:53,811
- Give me my keys.
- Your car smell like burnt toast. It stinks.

708
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:57,780
- That's not toast. Get out of the car.
- Get off my neck!

709
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,150
Get off me!

710
00:42:12,895 --> 00:42:14,731
You guys okay?

711
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:23,139
Do you have any idea
what your insurance is gonna be?

712
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:26,242
That's the second car you done got blown up!
Gonna go through the roof!

713
00:42:26,342 --> 00:42:28,744
Police are no closer to a suspect

714
00:42:28,844 --> 00:42:31,248
in the shocking murder of Port
Commissioner Douglas Griffin.

715
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:33,717
And although the investigation continues,

716
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:36,186
the city has wasted no time in appointing
Charles NuÃ±ez as his successor.

717
00:42:36,286 --> 00:42:38,422
I will carry on my predecessor's mission

718
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:41,291
to eradicate corruption
and clean up the port,

719
00:42:41,391 --> 00:42:43,159
no matter the cost.

720
00:42:43,259 --> 00:42:45,829
No sign of him at the house.

721
00:42:45,929 --> 00:42:48,599
He's not going back to the house.
He's a wanted man.

722
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:52,170
Whoever's after A.J. needs to get to him,
even if that means killing you guys to do it.

723
00:42:53,436 --> 00:42:55,838
Guys, guys, guys.

724
00:42:55,938 --> 00:42:57,507
I'm a little disappointed.

725
00:42:57,607 --> 00:43:00,744
Since you've been here I've had
a nightclub shooting downtown,

726
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:05,382
I've fielded about 20 trespassing
complaints in Little Havana.

727
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:08,152
- And a freaking car blew up.
- We didn't plant the car bomb.

728
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,387
Yeah, but we did the other stuff, James.

729
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:13,958
I spoke to your lieutenant in Atlanta,
and he'd love it if you went home.

730
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,494
Happy travels, guys.

731
00:43:17,594 --> 00:43:19,896
Happy travels, my ass.
We ain't going nowhere.

732
00:43:19,996 --> 00:43:22,431
Answer that phone.

733
00:43:22,531 --> 00:43:23,833
- It's not my phone.
- It's in your pocket.

734
00:43:23,933 --> 00:43:25,936
Ain't no phone in...

735
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:28,572
There is a phone in my pocket.

736
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:31,208
A.J.'s phone. I never gave A.J.
back his phone.

737
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:33,777
The phone's been going off
the last couple of hours.

738
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:37,614
There's texts in here
from Tasha, Bree, Colette.

739
00:43:37,714 --> 00:43:40,817
First of all, A.J. is a "slore."
I'm-a call Tasha right now.

740
00:43:40,917 --> 00:43:43,987
No, that's gonna raise a red flag.
See if she got a work number.

741
00:43:45,621 --> 00:43:47,657
- "Tasha work." Good thinking, James.
- I know.

742
00:43:47,757 --> 00:43:49,393
- I'm just telling you.
- You ain't gotta tell me.

743
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:51,195
- I should. You did a good...
- Just call.

744
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,565
You know what your problem is?
You think you're cute, but you're not.

745
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:56,967
You're ugly. And you got man hands.

746
00:43:59,935 --> 00:44:02,572
Beach Kitten of South Beach,
open seven days a week...

747
00:44:02,672 --> 00:44:04,675
- Blam-a-Iam-bam!
- Guess we're going to Tasha's job.

748
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:07,577
I took this from your car.
I'm gonna go see my explosives guy.

749
00:44:07,677 --> 00:44:10,581
Maybe he can tell us
what kind of ordnance it was.

750
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:13,483
Damn, that's what left of your trunk.
They got you good.

751
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:16,821
- We're gonna need a new ride.
- I can help you with that.

752
00:44:18,621 --> 00:44:20,007
I gotta tell Angela.

753
00:44:20,107 --> 00:44:21,525
Don't tell her what we drivin'.

754
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:24,327
- Feel like a dope dealer. - Stop it.
This is the best car from the impound lot.

755
00:44:24,427 --> 00:44:27,331
Hey, baby.

756
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:28,965
- Guess what I call me and James?
- What?

757
00:44:29,065 --> 00:44:30,766
- Don't.
- The brothers-in-law!

758
00:44:30,866 --> 00:44:32,052
I love it.

759
00:44:32,152 --> 00:44:33,369
Don't say that no more.

760
00:44:33,469 --> 00:44:36,773
So, Ben, I don't have to worry about
not seeing you on Saturday, right?

761
00:44:36,873 --> 00:44:39,064
- I'll be home way before the wedding.
- You're finishing things up?

762
00:44:39,164 --> 00:44:42,313
I just got a lead. We're about
to crack this thing wide open.

763
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:45,849
Well, you do that. Everything's
all right here. We've got it all covered.

764
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:47,851
"We"? Ange, is Cori over there?

765
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:50,586
- Is that Ben? Let me talk to him.
- No, don't put her...

766
00:44:50,686 --> 00:44:54,925
What kind of man leaves town
a week before the wedding?

767
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,827
- A detective man.
- You're not a detective.

768
00:44:56,927 --> 00:45:00,764
I'm not gonna shout with you right now.
Respect my choices, Cori.

769
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:04,400
- You gotta earn respect from me.
- Why you gotta keep going off-menu?

770
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,271
Because your menu is dog shit!

771
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,505
- Menu is not dog...
- Yes, it is, Ben.

772
00:45:09,605 --> 00:45:12,909
- That's why I put my Dreambook on Pinterest.
- Pinterest this! Bye!

773
00:45:14,143 --> 00:45:15,911
Cori.

774
00:45:16,011 --> 00:45:17,481
Cori?

775
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:20,384
I can't believe she just hung up on me.

776
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:25,489
You know your biggest problem?

777
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:27,858
- Here we go.
- You don't know how to stay focused.

778
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:30,927
I'm going through a crisis, and it'd be
real nice to get support from my brother.

779
00:45:31,027 --> 00:45:32,572
You ain't got no brother.

780
00:45:32,672 --> 00:45:35,204
What do you callthe guy
that's about to marry your sister?

781
00:45:35,231 --> 00:45:38,969
Not my brother. That would be incest,
and that would be nasty.

782
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:42,739
You're twisting stuff. You twist things
because you don't have the ability to love.

783
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:44,675
I'll prove it. Let me take the lead.

784
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:46,710
- I'll show you I could be a detective.
- Hell no.

785
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:50,079
- Tell me why. - This girl's probably
not gonna wanna talk to us in public.

786
00:45:50,179 --> 00:45:53,750
So it's not gonna be a good look if you get
all screechy or accidentally shoot the girl.

787
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:56,552
- Why can't you let the past be the past?
- You can't even handle Cori!

788
00:45:56,652 --> 00:45:59,856
She's irrelevant right now. The girl
is the devil's spawn with lady parts.

789
00:45:59,956 --> 00:46:02,092
I'm taking the lead
'cause I'm the detective.

790
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:05,929
Fine. It's like I'm dealing with a child.

791
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:08,597
My God.

792
00:46:08,697 --> 00:46:09,650
James, do you see this?

793
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:10,733
Yep.

794
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:12,869
It's like a Costco for supermodels.
Look at this.

795
00:46:12,969 --> 00:46:14,971
James. She's like a dolphin.

796
00:46:15,071 --> 00:46:16,672
- Hey, stay focused.
- I'm focused.

797
00:46:16,772 --> 00:46:18,441
At the same time, I'm not.

798
00:46:19,976 --> 00:46:23,045
Hello.

799
00:46:23,145 --> 00:46:24,415
Can I help you?

800
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:25,815
Yep.

801
00:46:25,915 --> 00:46:30,853
- Where's Tasha? - Give me a second.
I gotta get her from the back.

802
00:46:30,953 --> 00:46:34,457
Tasha? Two police officers
here to see you. Thanks

803
00:46:34,557 --> 00:46:39,061
- Can I get anybody a bottled water?
- No, no. I'm fine. I'm about to get married.

804
00:46:39,161 --> 00:46:41,498
I'm engaged right now, so...

805
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:43,567
- Didn't nobody ask you that.
- I'm just letting her know.

806
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:46,536
You can't put a fish in the water
if you don't want him to swim.

807
00:46:46,636 --> 00:46:49,739
I don't know where he is,
and if I did I wouldn't tell you.

808
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:52,007
You will if you wanna see him alive again.

809
00:46:52,107 --> 00:46:55,478
A.J. is in way over his head
and we just trying to help him.

810
00:46:55,578 --> 00:46:57,847
- Why should I believe you?
- I didn't come here to play with you.

811
00:46:57,947 --> 00:47:01,050
- You think I'm gonna give up my man?
- You're gonna give him up. Guaranteed.

812
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:03,619
- Nope, I'm not.
- Stop. It's a little too much.

813
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:08,759
Tasha, James may not understand
what you're saying, but I do.

814
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:11,762
You and A.J. obviously have a connection
and you're trying to honor him right now.

815
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:13,963
Right, James?

816
00:47:14,063 --> 00:47:16,632
My question to everyone standing here is,

817
00:47:16,732 --> 00:47:19,001
"Is he honoring you, Tasha?"

818
00:47:19,101 --> 00:47:21,804
Because when I went through this phone
here, I'm not gonna lie to you...

819
00:47:21,904 --> 00:47:24,807
I was kinda thrown off by what
was going on in the contact list.

820
00:47:24,907 --> 00:47:26,175
Especially the favorites.

821
00:47:26,275 --> 00:47:28,778
Because the first name
I came across was Colette.

822
00:47:28,878 --> 00:47:31,181
I said, "Who is Colette?"
More importantly, "What's her ringtone?"

823
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:33,183
So I played it.

824
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:39,789
I don't know about you, but that
throws me off 'cause it's hypersexual.

825
00:47:39,889 --> 00:47:42,492
What's that relationship about?
So I said, "Maybe that's the only one."

826
00:47:42,592 --> 00:47:44,628
- But then right underneath it, I see "Bree."
- Bree?

827
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:48,065
Yeah. Who is that? What's her ringtone?
So I played it.

828
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,570
- James, do you hear that?
- Let me see.

829
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:56,172
- Yeah, he licking that up and down, no doubt.
- That's a little graphic.

830
00:47:56,272 --> 00:47:58,541
- It's true.
- Well... Disregard that.

831
00:47:58,641 --> 00:48:01,043
So then I started thinking about you.

832
00:48:01,143 --> 00:48:03,579
You're priority.
At least I thought you were.

833
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:07,583
But then I see your name at the bottom of
the list? "Maybe he saved best for last."

834
00:48:07,683 --> 00:48:10,821
Then I played your ringtone, Tasha.
This is where it got dark.

835
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,925
Tasha, that's a Apple chime.

836
00:48:17,226 --> 00:48:18,894
That's a factory ringtone.

837
00:48:18,994 --> 00:48:20,697
That cost absolutely nothing.

838
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:22,965
That's the guy that you wanna take up for?

839
00:48:23,065 --> 00:48:24,934
Mr. Generic Ringtone For My Lady?

840
00:48:25,034 --> 00:48:27,603
I'm just asking.

841
00:48:27,703 --> 00:48:30,039
That is how you talk to a woman.

842
00:48:30,139 --> 00:48:33,076
I got A.J.'s cell phone
burner number just like that.

843
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:35,978
Okay. When did we start doing that?

844
00:48:36,078 --> 00:48:39,048
- Maya, what you got? - My guy
Alonso's following a lead on the explosives.

845
00:48:39,148 --> 00:48:41,751
- It's definitely not from the States.
- We got a number on A.J.

846
00:48:41,851 --> 00:48:43,954
No, Ben got a number on A.J.

847
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:46,690
His girl say he stole some money,
but she didn't know from who.

848
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,057
- Let me know when you find him.
- Champagne?

849
00:48:48,157 --> 00:48:50,126
Hey. What are you doing?

850
00:48:50,226 --> 00:48:53,063
Why is it so hard for you
to say the word "we"?

851
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:54,416
What is wrong with you?

852
00:48:54,516 --> 00:48:55,798
What's wrong with you? You...

853
00:48:55,898 --> 00:48:58,101
Is that her number saved
to your phone already?

854
00:48:58,201 --> 00:48:59,521
With a smiley face next to it?

855
00:48:59,621 --> 00:49:00,971
Let's go.

856
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:04,173
The smiley face with the tongue
sticking out is what you're doing now?

857
00:49:04,273 --> 00:49:07,577
You know why Tasha gave us the number?
I got the human touch.

858
00:49:07,677 --> 00:49:09,778
You just gotta be open.

859
00:49:09,878 --> 00:49:14,818
And let me tell you, that is much more
important than being focused.

860
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:17,621
Half a second. Listen. Here's what
we're going to focus on from now on.

861
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:20,956
I'm gonna deal with all
of the human parts, male or female.

862
00:49:21,056 --> 00:49:23,293
- You wanna deal with all the male human parts?
- That's not what I said.

863
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:25,061
- That's exactly what you said.
- Don't twist my words.

864
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:31,635
- Hello?
- Ben Barber speaking.

865
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:33,269
How'd you get this number?

866
00:49:33,369 --> 00:49:35,572
A little something called
platinum-level detectiveness.

867
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:37,106
Give me that phone. A.J.

868
00:49:37,206 --> 00:49:38,942
Your girlfriend told us
about the money you stole.

869
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:41,844
- I didn't steal any money.
- Be open.

870
00:49:41,944 --> 00:49:44,114
Turn yourself in, man.
We need to keep you safe.

871
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:46,550
How do I know
you weren't in on trying to kill me?

872
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,952
If I wanted to smoke you,
you'd be dead already.

873
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:53,657
You got some major heat on you, the kind
of heat that your skinny ass can't take.

874
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:55,958
I hang up, A.J., you dead in 24 hours.

875
00:49:56,058 --> 00:49:59,195
Look around, man.
We the only friends you got.

876
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:02,666
You know what? I'm sick of
talking to your ass. Here.

877
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:05,135
Wait, wait, wait! Wait! Wait! Hello?

878
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:06,936
- Hello? Hello?
- Hello?

879
00:50:07,036 --> 00:50:09,338
Hello. Ben Barber back on the phone.

880
00:50:09,438 --> 00:50:12,743
I'll text you a time and location.
Just you, or I bolt.

881
00:50:14,777 --> 00:50:17,614
- What was that?
- It worked, didn't it?

882
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:22,152
This nerd steals my money, exposes my
operation, and he's still walking the streets?

883
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:24,788
- I put my best guys on him.
- You'd better.

884
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:26,922
The livelihood of merchants
across the globe depend on it.

885
00:50:27,022 --> 00:50:29,092
- I get it.
- I don't think you do.

886
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:32,929
My pipeline is opening. We are exposed.

887
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:36,467
- Kill him.
- Yes, sir.

888
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:40,670
And what about the payment? Did it
get through, or did that get stolen too?

889
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:43,739
- Receipt confirmed by the new commissioner.
- Look at that.

890
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,809
One thing done right.
Things are looking up.

891
00:50:46,909 --> 00:50:48,678
Now get out of here. I'm late.

892
00:51:02,156 --> 00:51:03,292
Here it is.

893
00:51:04,393 --> 00:51:06,762
- Remember what I told you.
- Yeah.

894
00:51:06,862 --> 00:51:08,665
One eye on him and one eye out.

895
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:17,072
I can't do it. Show me how.

896
00:51:17,172 --> 00:51:18,642
Man, you not a lizard. Just scan.

897
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,242
Well, you have to say that.

898
00:51:20,342 --> 00:51:21,811
- Get out.
- Okay.

899
00:51:21,911 --> 00:51:23,714
- I'll be listening.
- All right.

900
00:51:28,118 --> 00:51:30,387
I'm walking on the damn beach.

901
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:33,255
Listen, A.J., I don't have time
to play games with you.

902
00:51:33,355 --> 00:51:36,259
- Where are you?
- Slow your roll, son. It's not that easy.

903
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:38,327
- We gotta make sure we're clear.
- Watch your tone.

904
00:51:38,427 --> 00:51:41,231
- I didn't come out here to be sassed by you.
- Okay, walk to the booth.

905
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:42,500
What booth? Where?

906
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,800
The other way. Turn around.

907
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,668
- This booth?
- Yeah, that booth right there.

908
00:51:45,768 --> 00:51:47,436
Okay, I'm walking. Going to the booth.

909
00:51:47,536 --> 00:51:50,873
- Now what? I'm here.
- Okay, I want you to pick up a can.

910
00:51:50,973 --> 00:51:52,775
- I got it.
- Now put it back down.

911
00:51:52,875 --> 00:51:54,344
A.J., what are we doing right now?

912
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,179
I'm seeing if you're being followed.

913
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,248
Then say that. That makes sense. Say that.

914
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:00,250
- Just walk.
- All right, walking.

915
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,786
Stop. Remove your shirt.

916
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:05,789
- Why am I removing my shirt?
- To make sure you're not wired.

917
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:07,356
See that? There's no wire.

918
00:52:07,456 --> 00:52:10,293
You are shredded. Abs of steel.

919
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:12,695
- Stop playing games.
- Okay, walk to the trash can.

920
00:52:12,795 --> 00:52:14,197
To the trash can? Going.

921
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:17,000
All right.

922
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:20,069
- Now what? - Now reach into the trash can
and take out whatever's on top.

923
00:52:22,404 --> 00:52:23,607
Is he digging in the trash?

924
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:24,940
I got it.

925
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,343
Okay, open the contents
and tell me what it is.

926
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:34,250
It's, just some half-eaten nachos

927
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:37,119
with sauce and guacamole
and hair all in it.

928
00:52:37,219 --> 00:52:38,887
Good. That's perfect.

929
00:52:38,987 --> 00:52:40,023
Eat it.

930
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:41,190
I'm sorry. What?

931
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:44,094
- Eat... it.
- I'm not eat... No! I'm not eating this.

932
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:46,496
- Do it, or I walk.
- You better not eat that.

933
00:52:58,007 --> 00:53:00,175
That's just nasty.

934
00:53:00,275 --> 00:53:03,045
That was sick.
I can't believe you actually did that.

935
00:53:03,145 --> 00:53:05,914
That shit was gross.

936
00:53:06,014 --> 00:53:07,817
Get your ass out here right now.

937
00:53:07,917 --> 00:53:11,954
A.J., you got two seconds
to get out here before you go to jail.

938
00:53:12,054 --> 00:53:14,891
We gotta get out of here.
This is not the place for this.

939
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:18,228
- Then why would you ask me to meet you
out here? - I didn't think it through.

940
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:20,429
A.J. A.J.

941
00:53:27,603 --> 00:53:30,039
Hey, A.J., somebody
is trying to kill all of us.

942
00:53:30,139 --> 00:53:31,541
They blew up my car looking for you,

943
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:34,344
so you need to come clean
and tell us who it is.

944
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:36,880
I already told you everything.

945
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:39,815
We got company.

946
00:53:39,915 --> 00:53:41,884
- Get down!
- Shit!

947
00:53:43,552 --> 00:53:45,387
- What are you doing?
- I'm about to start shooting!

948
00:53:45,487 --> 00:53:47,257
You ain't never shot out of a moving car!

949
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:49,025
You gonna drive or you gonna
shoot, James? Pick one!

950
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:50,960
Shit!

951
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,561
Switch!

952
00:53:52,661 --> 00:53:54,463
- I'm going over.
- Hurry!

953
00:53:54,563 --> 00:53:57,167
You guys are gonna do that now?

954
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:01,570
- Stop!
- Get your ass off of me!

955
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:03,573
James, you didn't move!

956
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,009
I got it! I got it!

957
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:11,882
My God!

958
00:54:13,282 --> 00:54:15,585
Why you got the damn seat
so far back, James?

959
00:54:19,922 --> 00:54:21,891
- Front!
- James!

960
00:54:21,991 --> 00:54:24,059
- All right. Don't head straight at 'em!
- Not right now, James.

961
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:26,330
- I'm getting in my mode.
- What mode?

962
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:31,068
What the hell are you doing? Ben!

963
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:40,477
Fuck!

964
00:54:43,078 --> 00:54:44,413
Get back!

965
00:54:49,351 --> 00:54:51,221
They're coming back!

966
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:53,523
I got it.

967
00:54:59,194 --> 00:55:00,529
Hold on!

968
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:14,610
- What the hell was that?
- What?

969
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:17,347
That's called driving!

970
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:19,181
Where you learn how to drive, man?

971
00:55:19,281 --> 00:55:22,885
James, just get off my back
and let me do me.

972
00:55:22,985 --> 00:55:24,487
- Bust a "U"!
- Hold on!

973
00:55:29,525 --> 00:55:31,594
- Lose them! - I'm driving.
I don't need that type of pressure.

974
00:55:31,694 --> 00:55:33,463
- Let me out of here!
- Worried about what I'm doing?

975
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:35,530
How about you shoot somebody?

976
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:37,199
Lean back!

977
00:55:37,299 --> 00:55:39,002
Don't shoot across my face like that!

978
00:55:48,277 --> 00:55:49,980
Are you signaling?

979
00:55:51,279 --> 00:55:52,715
I'm sorry. It's a habit.

980
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,423
He's making a right. This is too easy!

981
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:10,166
- He told you not to do that!
- Listen, I got a plan.

982
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:12,269
Well, execute the goddamn plan!

983
00:56:15,804 --> 00:56:17,440
Here we go!

984
00:56:19,241 --> 00:56:20,676
- He's making another right.
- Everybody hold on.

985
00:56:25,581 --> 00:56:27,751
Shit! He went left!

986
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:34,523
- Yeah!
- I'm Ben Barber, bitch!

987
00:56:37,226 --> 00:56:39,029
Game over.

988
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:51,673
- Get your ass out.
- Come on, dude!

989
00:56:51,773 --> 00:56:54,210
Let me go. You guys are nuts.

990
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:56,179
- Where the hell are we?
- Safe house.

991
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:59,148
We staying here till
we find out who we can trust.

992
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,318
- Really, fellas?
- Whose house is this?

993
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:04,519
Alonso's. My explosives guy.

994
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:06,456
He's out on a case.

995
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:07,725
Who the hell is she?

996
00:57:07,825 --> 00:57:09,025
I'm Miami Homicide.

997
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:11,494
James, if you give me to the cops,

998
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,496
I will be hanging from a bedsheet.

999
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,597
You think I give a damn, A.J.?

1000
00:57:15,697 --> 00:57:17,632
Who did you steal from,
and who's shooting at us?

1001
00:57:17,732 --> 00:57:18,635
I ain't telling you shit.

1002
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:19,668
Is that right?

1003
00:57:19,768 --> 00:57:22,005
Pope! Antonio Pope!

1004
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,639
- A-N-T-O-N-I-O!
- Antonio Pope?

1005
00:57:23,739 --> 00:57:25,708
- That's bullshit.
- It's not bullshit, all right?

1006
00:57:25,808 --> 00:57:29,311
Everyone thinks Pope is this legit
businessman, but he's so not.

1007
00:57:29,411 --> 00:57:32,481
He is a huge criminal, into everything.

1008
00:57:32,581 --> 00:57:34,001
Drugs, guns.

1009
00:57:34,101 --> 00:57:35,550
So Troy must be his Atlanta boy.

1010
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:37,619
Yes!

1011
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:41,056
That's a big operation.
Catching Pope would get us Troy for sure.

1012
00:57:41,156 --> 00:57:44,126
To sum up, I'm his cyber dark arts guy.

1013
00:57:44,226 --> 00:57:46,596
I hack into his competition.
I install his systems.

1014
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:48,664
I launder his money.

1015
00:57:48,764 --> 00:57:51,166
You just admitted to about
four or five crimes right there.

1016
00:57:51,266 --> 00:57:53,168
That's Fifth Amendment.
A couple of days ago,

1017
00:57:53,268 --> 00:57:56,172
I may have taken some money
from his account

1018
00:57:56,272 --> 00:57:58,074
and put it into mine.

1019
00:57:58,174 --> 00:58:00,342
- You "may have"?
- I didn't think he'd notice.

1020
00:58:00,442 --> 00:58:02,110
- Apparently, he did.
- Maya, what the hell is that...

1021
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:04,246
Drop your gun, man!

1022
00:58:04,346 --> 00:58:05,648
- Put it down!
- Drop it!

1023
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:07,250
Hold on!

1024
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:09,385
- A.J., stop screaming!
- I'll shoot your face!

1025
00:58:09,485 --> 00:58:12,521
- This is Alonso, my explosives guy.
- Put it down, now!

1026
00:58:12,621 --> 00:58:15,124
- Alonso, holster your weapon. They're cops.
- You better drop it!

1027
00:58:15,224 --> 00:58:17,039
- Put your gun away.
- Put it down, Castro!

1028
00:58:17,139 --> 00:58:18,972
Drop it!

1029
00:58:19,862 --> 00:58:21,630
- It's down, okay? You put it down.
- Ben, we're good.

1030
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:23,466
All right.

1031
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,436
What the hell?

1032
00:58:27,536 --> 00:58:29,172
Again?

1033
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:31,340
- You've done this before?
- I don't know what to tell you.

1034
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,608
- I'm on edge.
- We're cop killers!

1035
00:58:32,708 --> 00:58:33,928
My nerves is bad, man!

1036
00:58:34,028 --> 00:58:35,277
I told you to focus!

1037
00:58:35,377 --> 00:58:37,079
You think I meant to do it?
I thought he shot.

1038
00:58:37,179 --> 00:58:38,447
You didn't shoot, so I shot!

1039
00:58:38,547 --> 00:58:41,416
Oh, my God! He a zombie!

1040
00:58:41,516 --> 00:58:44,119
Head shot!

1041
00:58:44,219 --> 00:58:46,255
Hold up! Hold up! Hold up!

1042
00:58:46,355 --> 00:58:47,557
It's a vest!

1043
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:50,126
Idiots.

1044
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:51,461
It's a vest.

1045
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:57,333
That's why I need a vest, James.
Accidents like this.

1046
00:58:57,433 --> 00:58:59,802
Who are these two fools,
and what are they doing in my house?

1047
00:58:59,902 --> 00:59:02,338
They're the officers from Atlanta.
It was their car that exploded.

1048
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:04,639
Hey, man. I'm Ben Barber. I apologize.

1049
00:59:04,739 --> 00:59:06,876
- Hey, man. CÃ¡llate la boca.
- What?

1050
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:09,846
Or I reach into your chest
and snatch out your midget heart.

1051
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:11,481
Okay. I came over here to apologize.

1052
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:13,181
- You shot me.
- Well, I take it back.

1053
00:59:13,281 --> 00:59:14,583
- Take the sorry with you and leave.
- Fine!

1054
00:59:14,683 --> 00:59:18,153
Can we just stay focused?
Did you find anything out?

1055
00:59:18,253 --> 00:59:20,556
The explosive from the car
and the detonator are both rare.

1056
00:59:20,656 --> 00:59:23,192
- Eastern European, actually.
- It's freaking Pope!

1057
00:59:23,292 --> 00:59:26,128
- Can you stop with that?
- Hold on, Maya. He could be telling the truth.

1058
00:59:26,228 --> 00:59:29,165
It would take someone with serious reach
to locate that kind of untraceable device.

1059
00:59:30,532 --> 00:59:32,835
You're gonna help me
get some hard evidence on him.

1060
00:59:32,935 --> 00:59:35,871
Pope ain't gonna stop shooting at your ass,
so we the only choice you got.

1061
00:59:35,971 --> 00:59:38,641
You set up his computer, right?

1062
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,742
So, can you get us into it?

1063
00:59:40,842 --> 00:59:42,878
Someone would need to get
to his home computer

1064
00:59:42,978 --> 00:59:45,347
and download the shipping manifests.

1065
00:59:45,447 --> 00:59:47,382
Well, Pope's having a party
at his mansion tonight.

1066
00:59:47,482 --> 00:59:49,385
Security's gonna be tight.

1067
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:52,255
- There's gonna be a lot of foreign
dignitaries there. - No problem.

1068
00:59:52,355 --> 00:59:53,922
We're gonna get in there undetected.

1069
00:59:54,022 --> 00:59:55,891
He's gonna let us know
where the computer is

1070
00:59:55,991 --> 00:59:57,827
and he gonna talk us through.

1071
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:59,429
How do we get in undetected?

1072
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,443
Name?

1073
01:00:14,543 --> 01:00:15,911
My name.

1074
01:00:16,011 --> 01:00:17,746
My name.

1075
01:00:17,846 --> 01:00:19,382
Prince Admiral Steven Matumbe.

1076
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:21,351
Nigerian consul.

1077
01:00:22,752 --> 01:00:25,755
Plus two. My two servants.

1078
01:00:25,855 --> 01:00:27,422
I don't have you on the list.

1079
01:00:27,522 --> 01:00:31,494
Then check the VIP list.
And do not look me in my eye.

1080
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:33,228
Don't look at me.

1081
01:00:33,328 --> 01:00:35,264
You look at the pad. You read the names.

1082
01:00:35,364 --> 01:00:37,266
You look at me, and you close your eyes.

1083
01:00:37,366 --> 01:00:38,867
Look at me. Don't look at me.

1084
01:00:38,967 --> 01:00:41,304
Look at me! That was a test.

1085
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:44,407
- You failed.
- You... aren't on it.

1086
01:00:44,507 --> 01:00:46,375
All right. Stall him, guys.

1087
01:00:46,475 --> 01:00:48,476
- A.J.'s on it.
- Step aside, por favor.

1088
01:00:48,576 --> 01:00:49,979
Wait!

1089
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:53,682
This is all your fault.

1090
01:00:53,782 --> 01:00:56,719
You know I do what I am supposed to do.

1091
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:59,387
I clothe you, I feed you,

1092
01:00:59,487 --> 01:01:02,757
and yet your incompetence infuriates me.

1093
01:01:02,857 --> 01:01:04,527
Sir.

1094
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:06,829
I'm your bodyguard, not your servant.

1095
01:01:09,898 --> 01:01:11,967
You are what I say you are!

1096
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:14,436
God.

1097
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:16,706
Sorry, sir.

1098
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:18,407
You got a fly on your face.

1099
01:01:22,677 --> 01:01:24,614
Traditional. A sign of respect.

1100
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:29,352
- Okay, try it now.
- Check the list one more time.

1101
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:32,621
There it is.

1102
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:35,523
Sorry about that. Head right in.

1103
01:01:35,623 --> 01:01:37,492
I will go.

1104
01:01:37,592 --> 01:01:39,362
- No, no, no!
- Release me!

1105
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:42,498
- This way.
- Where are we? I cannot feel my face.

1106
01:01:42,598 --> 01:01:44,433
And you're welcome.

1107
01:01:47,402 --> 01:01:49,389
Hello.

1108
01:01:49,489 --> 01:01:51,507
Remember, we're on the defense.

1109
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:55,510
A.J. is on the earpiece.
All you gotta do is download the file.

1110
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:56,913
You trust him to do this?

1111
01:01:57,013 --> 01:01:58,347
Of course not.

1112
01:01:58,447 --> 01:01:59,784
Do we have a choice?

1113
01:01:59,884 --> 01:02:01,318
First of all, Ben can hear you.

1114
01:02:03,518 --> 01:02:05,987
James, look at that.
They got a Baccarat diamond dolphin.

1115
01:02:06,087 --> 01:02:08,056
Yeah, he probably got a Gucci toilet too.

1116
01:02:08,156 --> 01:02:10,326
- Do I look like I care? Stay on point.
- Just walk.

1117
01:02:10,426 --> 01:02:12,795
If he got a Gucci toilet,
I'm sitting on it.

1118
01:02:19,668 --> 01:02:22,605
There he is. A.J., can you hear us?

1119
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:25,875
Hey, is this a passed app event?
'Cause I'd love a wonton or two.

1120
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:28,376
- It's not racist if I say it.
- Where are we going?

1121
01:02:28,476 --> 01:02:30,512
First, you have to get
to the north hallway.

1122
01:02:30,612 --> 01:02:32,514
It leads to the other wing of the house.

1123
01:02:32,614 --> 01:02:34,317
I'm gonna create a distraction.

1124
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:37,018
You guys, act casual
until you see an opening.

1125
01:02:45,927 --> 01:02:47,463
What you doing? Put your hands down.

1126
01:02:47,563 --> 01:02:50,032
I'm waving.

1127
01:02:56,572 --> 01:02:58,940
Law enforcement is always
welcome at my functions.

1128
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:01,844
So, Mr. Pope, do you dance?

1129
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:03,980
Do I dance?

1130
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:07,016
You're in for a treat.

1131
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:29,905
- Are you dancing?
- Yes.

1132
01:03:30,005 --> 01:03:31,508
Well, stop.

1133
01:03:40,882 --> 01:03:43,452
Okay, it worked.

1134
01:03:43,552 --> 01:03:44,705
Let's get busy.

1135
01:03:44,805 --> 01:03:45,987
He's really good though.

1136
01:03:46,087 --> 01:03:47,823
I'm not sure... Let's go.

1137
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:54,896
Okay, Ben, go up the first set of stairs.

1138
01:03:54,996 --> 01:03:57,465
- Roger that.
- And proceed to the end of the hallway.

1139
01:03:57,565 --> 01:04:00,568
All right, James. It's stealth mode time.

1140
01:04:00,668 --> 01:04:02,838
Do you even know what "stealth mode" mean?

1141
01:04:02,938 --> 01:04:05,141
Yes, it's from Assassin's Creed.
It means be undetectable.

1142
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:07,842
The double doors to his office
are on the left.

1143
01:04:07,942 --> 01:04:09,077
- Okay.
- Tell me when you're there.

1144
01:04:09,177 --> 01:04:11,214
All right, A.J. This must be it here.

1145
01:04:13,815 --> 01:04:15,483
- It's locked, A.J.
- Okay, you know what?

1146
01:04:15,583 --> 01:04:17,519
Guest bathroom is down the hallway.
We'll get in from there.

1147
01:04:17,619 --> 01:04:19,121
Okay.

1148
01:04:19,221 --> 01:04:22,592
Go, go, go. I got this.

1149
01:04:24,125 --> 01:04:25,595
Hey, man. Did you see her?

1150
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:27,195
See who?

1151
01:04:27,295 --> 01:04:29,864
I think she went down there.
She said she was gonna have my baby.

1152
01:04:29,964 --> 01:04:31,666
No, man, you can't be up...

1153
01:04:31,766 --> 01:04:34,036
Get downstairs. Use the bathroom
downstairs. Get down there.

1154
01:04:34,136 --> 01:04:36,771
Okay, I need you to go
over to the window and open it.

1155
01:04:36,871 --> 01:04:39,007
Okay, I see it. I see it. I see it.

1156
01:04:39,107 --> 01:04:40,775
Okay.

1157
01:04:40,875 --> 01:04:42,445
- All right, it's open.
- Climb out.

1158
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,031
I'm sorry. What?

1159
01:04:44,131 --> 01:04:45,715
You heard me. I said climb out.

1160
01:04:49,784 --> 01:04:51,586
A.J., I'm two stories up.

1161
01:04:51,686 --> 01:04:53,489
Look, we're here now, so own it.

1162
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:56,157
Nobody say nothing to me about
getting out of no window two stories up.

1163
01:04:56,257 --> 01:04:58,860
- Ben, get on that damn ledge.
- I'm two stories up, James!

1164
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,531
You heard me. Get on that ledge now.

1165
01:05:04,766 --> 01:05:06,268
They got a Gucci toilet, James.

1166
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:15,744
Come on, Ben.

1167
01:05:18,279 --> 01:05:20,015
Okay.

1168
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,918
Okay.

1169
01:05:29,058 --> 01:05:31,994
Hey, guys? I'm in-between
two lamps and a hard place.

1170
01:05:34,029 --> 01:05:36,865
I'm just gonna try to reach for it.

1171
01:05:36,965 --> 01:05:40,536
Okay? No, no! Guys! Lost balance!

1172
01:05:42,495 --> 01:05:44,172
God!

1173
01:05:44,272 --> 01:05:45,774
Stupid.

1174
01:05:55,302 --> 01:05:56,518
Excuse me, sir.

1175
01:05:56,618 --> 01:05:58,887
- Can I offer you a lamb burger?
- Stop! James!

1176
01:05:59,888 --> 01:06:01,155
Get back! Get back!

1177
01:06:01,255 --> 01:06:02,992
- Lamb burger?
- Yeah.

1178
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:04,793
I ain't never had one of them. Let me see.

1179
01:06:04,893 --> 01:06:07,228
Help!

1180
01:06:07,328 --> 01:06:10,298
My God!

1181
01:06:10,398 --> 01:06:13,068
- Got a Spanish kick to it. What kind
of cheese is that? - Manchego cheese.

1182
01:06:13,168 --> 01:06:14,904
Manchego?

1183
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:24,613
- Leave me alone!
- Nah, this is...

1184
01:06:26,714 --> 01:06:28,684
- Help!
- You didn't cook these, did you?

1185
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:31,219
Get your ass back!

1186
01:06:31,319 --> 01:06:32,788
Ben, what's going on?

1187
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:36,258
Get back! Gator got my foot!

1188
01:06:37,726 --> 01:06:39,796
Get off! Get off my ankle!

1189
01:06:40,795 --> 01:06:42,297
Leave me alone!

1190
01:06:44,032 --> 01:06:46,002
I don't wanna die like this!

1191
01:06:49,737 --> 01:06:51,073
I don't care! You can keep it!

1192
01:06:57,913 --> 01:06:59,981
Ben, you okay?

1193
01:07:00,081 --> 01:07:01,084
Are you okay? Confirm.

1194
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:02,217
Shut the hell up, A.J.!

1195
01:07:02,317 --> 01:07:04,954
- You couldn't tell me that he had a alligator?
- I dropped the ball on that.

1196
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:06,855
- I won't lie to you.
- A alligator!

1197
01:07:06,955 --> 01:07:09,858
- Did Marcus bite you?
- Can I offer you a drink?

1198
01:07:09,958 --> 01:07:12,061
No.

1199
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:13,929
Wait. Maya, I need more time!

1200
01:07:14,029 --> 01:07:15,764
A gator got my shoe.

1201
01:07:15,864 --> 01:07:19,134
Yes, I-I would actually
love to have a drink.

1202
01:07:19,234 --> 01:07:20,735
Fantastic.

1203
01:07:20,835 --> 01:07:22,004
Do you like tequila?

1204
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:23,304
Yeah.

1205
01:07:23,404 --> 01:07:24,974
All right. What's going on?

1206
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:27,076
Hold on, James.

1207
01:07:27,176 --> 01:07:28,844
Okay.

1208
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:31,045
Okay, A.J., I'm headed
in the office right now.

1209
01:07:31,145 --> 01:07:33,748
- Wait, wait! - What? What?
What? He got a alligator in here?

1210
01:07:33,848 --> 01:07:36,217
No. It's gator-free from here on out.

1211
01:07:36,317 --> 01:07:38,987
- There's an audio alarm system.
- When were you gonna tell me that?

1212
01:07:39,087 --> 01:07:41,690
- You don't think that's need-to-know information?
- No one's perfect.

1213
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:43,759
Just get to the desk quietly.

1214
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:45,728
Stop playing. This is serious.

1215
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:48,063
Okay. Going to the desk now.

1216
01:07:49,897 --> 01:07:52,300
He got a black panther!

1217
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,902
Jesus!

1218
01:07:55,002 --> 01:07:57,373
Quietly, Ben!

1219
01:07:57,473 --> 01:07:59,340
The alarm system is picking up
some audio in Pope's office.

1220
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,010
- Check it out.
- Copy.

1221
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:03,177
James? Ben set off the alarm.

1222
01:08:03,277 --> 01:08:05,146
You're gonna have to run interference.
East hallway.

1223
01:08:05,246 --> 01:08:07,916
- He's traveling towards you.
- Okay.

1224
01:08:08,016 --> 01:08:09,284
Okay.

1225
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:14,289
Got hydrangeas.

1226
01:08:14,389 --> 01:08:16,225
He's got hydrangeas.

1227
01:08:16,325 --> 01:08:18,227
Sorry.

1228
01:08:25,032 --> 01:08:28,737
Okay, A.J. I'm at the computer.
Guide me through it.

1229
01:08:28,837 --> 01:08:31,873
There's a seven-digit code that he
inputted himself, so I don't know it.

1230
01:08:31,973 --> 01:08:34,275
But I use my own personal code
on there as well

1231
01:08:34,375 --> 01:08:36,110
'cause, you know, why not?

1232
01:08:36,210 --> 01:08:38,046
You really are a criminal,
aren't you, A.J.?

1233
01:08:38,146 --> 01:08:39,414
- What's the code?
- Open bracket-O...

1234
01:08:39,514 --> 01:08:43,018
Close bracket-space...
open bracket-O-close bracket.

1235
01:08:43,118 --> 01:08:45,254
Wait a minute. Wait. Are they...

1236
01:08:46,187 --> 01:08:48,690
Titties, yep.

1237
01:08:48,790 --> 01:08:52,261
- What now, A.J.? - Plug in that
flash drive and open the file on it.

1238
01:08:52,361 --> 01:08:55,096
- All right, I got it.
- The rest takes care of itself.

1239
01:08:55,196 --> 01:08:56,132
Thank you, my darling.

1240
01:08:56,232 --> 01:08:57,198
My pleasure.

1241
01:08:57,298 --> 01:08:59,301
So tell me about this tequila. Is it rare?

1242
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:02,304
One of the rarest on the market.
Impossible to purchase.

1243
01:09:02,404 --> 01:09:03,806
Salud.

1244
01:09:08,142 --> 01:09:09,811
Moments away, guys.

1245
01:09:09,911 --> 01:09:11,412
Look, you guys need to hurry up.

1246
01:09:11,512 --> 01:09:13,482
I ain't gonna keep
knocking people out all night.

1247
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:17,418
- Okay, it's done.
- Did you know...

1248
01:09:17,518 --> 01:09:18,655
Maya, let's roll.

1249
01:09:18,755 --> 01:09:19,921
I gotta go.

1250
01:09:20,021 --> 01:09:22,457
Thank you. Okay. My hand.

1251
01:09:22,557 --> 01:09:25,194
I gotta... I gotta go. High five.

1252
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:27,863
Here you go.

1253
01:09:27,963 --> 01:09:30,164
This has got to be one
of the worst goddamn days.

1254
01:09:30,264 --> 01:09:34,103
Alligators, hydrangeas,
swords all over the place.

1255
01:09:34,203 --> 01:09:35,221
Where your shoe?

1256
01:09:35,321 --> 01:09:36,371
It's a long story, James.

1257
01:09:36,471 --> 01:09:37,641
The man got a damn alligator.

1258
01:09:37,741 --> 01:09:38,940
You look silly!

1259
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,842
You know what?

1260
01:09:40,942 --> 01:09:42,845
This look better, James?

1261
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:44,445
Is that better now?

1262
01:09:44,545 --> 01:09:45,631
Hey, guys, did you get it?

1263
01:09:45,731 --> 01:09:46,849
Yes. I'm a professional!

1264
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:49,251
Okay, we gotta go.

1265
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:51,821
Officers.

1266
01:09:54,121 --> 01:09:55,990
- Interesting look.
- Interesting home.

1267
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:57,359
- In my country...
- Cut the act.

1268
01:09:57,459 --> 01:09:59,727
- Yes.
- The party is this way.

1269
01:09:59,827 --> 01:10:02,097
- I insist.
- Okay.

1270
01:10:04,232 --> 01:10:05,801
Have a drink.

1271
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:07,970
RÃ©my? Dom?

1272
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:10,372
I got this shit from Peru.

1273
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:14,342
Illegal in the States, but,
it can keep you up all night.

1274
01:10:14,442 --> 01:10:16,311
If you know what I mean.

1275
01:10:18,446 --> 01:10:21,049
No. We're not thirsty.

1276
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:23,417
I'm not thirsty.

1277
01:10:24,317 --> 01:10:27,288
Look at that. Class is still in session.

1278
01:10:27,388 --> 01:10:30,792
When are you going to let Ben
make his own mistakes, James?

1279
01:10:30,892 --> 01:10:32,994
Yes, that's right. I know your names.

1280
01:10:33,094 --> 01:10:34,863
Does that surprise you?

1281
01:10:34,963 --> 01:10:39,067
Perhaps the bigger question is,
why are the Atlanta police crashing my party?

1282
01:10:39,167 --> 01:10:43,471
Well, we thought that you might
have a problem with theft.

1283
01:10:43,571 --> 01:10:48,277
Now that you mention it,
I did have an embezzlement issue this week.

1284
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:50,979
Don't remember reporting it though.

1285
01:10:51,079 --> 01:10:53,614
I'm guessing that you found the culprit.

1286
01:10:54,414 --> 01:10:55,850
You douche bag.

1287
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:59,854
I think you know who took from me.
And if I don't get some answers soon,

1288
01:10:59,954 --> 01:11:03,292
a few of my city official friends in Atlanta
won't be too happy to learn

1289
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:05,460
that one of their benefactors
is being harassed.

1290
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:07,162
In his own home, no less.

1291
01:11:07,262 --> 01:11:09,931
You gonna snitch on us?
Do you think we care?

1292
01:11:10,031 --> 01:11:13,268
It is true that one of you
might just receive a reprimand.

1293
01:11:13,368 --> 01:11:16,604
But what if one of you is still
on his probationary period?

1294
01:11:16,704 --> 01:11:22,144
That particular officer,
he could be eliminated... just like that.

1295
01:11:22,244 --> 01:11:24,979
Wait, wait, wait. I don't think we need
to ruin anybody's careers here.

1296
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:28,050
Especially with the unemployment rate
being so high amongst blacks now.

1297
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:30,418
- Tranquilo.
- I'm sorry, what?

1298
01:11:30,518 --> 01:11:34,189
Listen, all I know is that I'm a victim
of a hacker who stole from me.

1299
01:11:34,289 --> 01:11:35,690
I don't even want to have him arrested.

1300
01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:39,294
I want to figure out how he got in so
I can prevent it from happening again.

1301
01:11:39,394 --> 01:11:43,265
I'm worried that my charities
are vulnerable.

1302
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:46,935
So, if you are not here to help,
why did you come?

1303
01:11:47,035 --> 01:11:49,305
I heard you had a Gucci toilet.

1304
01:11:53,141 --> 01:11:56,478
I think we're done here.
My men will show you out.

1305
01:11:56,578 --> 01:12:00,948
And the next time you want to come
to one of my parties, just ask.

1306
01:12:01,048 --> 01:12:02,918
Your parties suck.

1307
01:12:07,521 --> 01:12:09,091
What went wrong?

1308
01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:13,195
Now I'm feeding these people sliders and having
conversations I don't want to be having?

1309
01:12:14,195 --> 01:12:18,432
Take it easy. I'm not going to shoot you.
This is just a prop to make my point.

1310
01:12:18,532 --> 01:12:23,907
We are multinational now.
Any mistakes will be way too costly?

1311
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:27,376
No more annoying conversations.

1312
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:29,310
No more excuses.

1313
01:12:29,410 --> 01:12:33,315
Just get the job done.

1314
01:12:36,752 --> 01:12:39,288
Sorry, Antonio.

1315
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:43,091
Definitely kill them. I just don't
want to get blood on my pants.

1316
01:12:46,527 --> 01:12:49,698
Okay, I found a discussion he tried
to erase on his big solar project.

1317
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:53,935
Looks like Pope orders his guy to delete
certain shipments from the manifest.

1318
01:12:54,035 --> 01:12:57,171
But he specifically tells that guy
to leave other shipments alone.

1319
01:12:57,271 --> 01:12:59,440
Why would he wanna hide
shipments of solar panels?

1320
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:01,342
Because it's not solar panels.

1321
01:13:01,442 --> 01:13:05,079
Well, he's got one of them hidden
shipments arriving tomorrow.

1322
01:13:05,179 --> 01:13:07,082
We need to find out
what's in that shipment.

1323
01:13:07,182 --> 01:13:09,083
Wait. Does that mean
what I think it means?

1324
01:13:09,183 --> 01:13:11,019
We are on a stakeout!

1325
01:13:11,119 --> 01:13:13,587
Longtime dream achievement unlocked.

1326
01:13:13,687 --> 01:13:16,024
I think I really proved myself this trip.

1327
01:13:16,124 --> 01:13:19,728
- I guarantee you, that truck will be full of drugs.
- All right, man, slow down.

1328
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:23,364
If the port commissioner wasn't cooperating,
it could be a problem.

1329
01:13:23,464 --> 01:13:24,900
One to kill for.

1330
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,403
He tried to cooperate,
but Pope still killed him anyway.

1331
01:13:28,503 --> 01:13:30,838
- How do you know that?
- I was there, on Pope's yacht.

1332
01:13:30,938 --> 01:13:34,109
I told you to tell me everything you know.
Why you didn't tell me everything you knew?

1333
01:13:34,209 --> 01:13:36,979
I didn't see anything.
I was listening in on his phone.

1334
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:40,081
- Then shut up with all that hearsay.
- It's not admissible in court.

1335
01:13:43,618 --> 01:13:46,587
Star Wars, the original trilogy.
Name 'em and rank 'em. Let's go.

1336
01:13:46,687 --> 01:13:49,190
Episode V: Empire Strikes Back.
Episode IV: New Hope.

1337
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:50,725
Episode VI, Jedi. Boom.

1338
01:13:50,825 --> 01:13:53,729
- Empire Strikes Back?
- What?

1339
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:56,664
- Return of the Jedi.
- Jedi! My God. Those Ewoks?

1340
01:13:56,764 --> 01:13:59,134
The Ewoks are what made Star Wars.

1341
01:13:59,234 --> 01:14:00,668
- They're so annoying.
- No, no.

1342
01:14:00,768 --> 01:14:02,604
- James. James.
- Maya. Maya.

1343
01:14:02,704 --> 01:14:04,072
- James, real quick.
- Maya.

1344
01:14:04,172 --> 01:14:05,707
- James... Maya.
- James... Maya.

1345
01:14:05,807 --> 01:14:07,375
You could be a shark or a eagle,
which would you be?

1346
01:14:07,475 --> 01:14:09,444
- Shark!
- You got so many disadvantages being a shark.

1347
01:14:09,544 --> 01:14:11,246
If you're an eagle, you're flying!

1348
01:14:11,346 --> 01:14:13,715
- I saw a eagle take this lady baby one time.
- No!

1349
01:14:13,815 --> 01:14:16,752
Biggie Smalls. Is he slightly overrated?

1350
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:19,054
- He's no Sir Mix-A-Lot.
- What?

1351
01:14:19,154 --> 01:14:20,322
- Maya?
- Maya? Maya?

1352
01:14:20,422 --> 01:14:21,655
- Maya?
- James?

1353
01:14:21,755 --> 01:14:24,091
- James?
- Shut up!

1354
01:14:27,294 --> 01:14:29,097
Damn.

1355
01:14:30,598 --> 01:14:32,267
They got some nerve.

1356
01:14:34,768 --> 01:14:37,605
He never stops talking.
He's got to be able to breathe.

1357
01:14:37,705 --> 01:14:40,274
Yep. Trust me, I know.

1358
01:14:40,374 --> 01:14:42,511
Nine out of 10 things out that dude mouth

1359
01:14:42,611 --> 01:14:45,613
is either crazy, irrational or silly.

1360
01:14:45,713 --> 01:14:47,715
But that 10th thing...

1361
01:14:49,383 --> 01:14:52,220
10th thing goes beyond crazy, you know,

1362
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:56,658
into a, like, accidental genius realm.

1363
01:14:56,758 --> 01:14:59,327
I'm gonna ask you something.

1364
01:14:59,427 --> 01:15:02,430
If you really feel that way,
why are you so tough on that guy?

1365
01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:05,567
All he wants is to be a detective.

1366
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:08,704
He's setting hisself up for a disappointment
when we get back, so...

1367
01:15:15,209 --> 01:15:16,677
Trucks!

1368
01:15:16,777 --> 01:15:19,314
James! I see the trucks!

1369
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:21,217
- The trucks are coming. Look!
- Give it to me.

1370
01:15:25,654 --> 01:15:28,355
A.J., get ready to check the container
numbers against the port's manifest.

1371
01:15:28,455 --> 01:15:29,658
Copy that.

1372
01:15:29,758 --> 01:15:31,859
Where are we going? Where are we going?

1373
01:15:31,959 --> 01:15:33,528
- This the one right here.
- What's the number?

1374
01:15:33,628 --> 01:15:37,165
4552345B.

1375
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,268
That number does not exist. It's a ghost.

1376
01:15:40,368 --> 01:15:41,570
Jackpot.

1377
01:15:50,978 --> 01:15:53,180
- There you go.
- Copy that.

1378
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,627
We're heading west on Port Bridge.

1379
01:15:54,727 --> 01:15:59,253
Bring all units on outbound lanes
and set up a blockade at Biscayne.

1380
01:15:59,553 --> 01:16:03,424
This is MDPD Air One.
En route following westbound 886.

1381
01:16:13,567 --> 01:16:15,303
Okay. Here we go.

1382
01:16:25,746 --> 01:16:27,649
- Hands! Hands up!
- Get your hands up!

1383
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:28,985
- Get them hands up!
- Put your hands up!

1384
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:31,365
Ben, get the door.

1385
01:16:32,587 --> 01:16:34,790
Out the cab, Slim!

1386
01:16:35,723 --> 01:16:37,359
Hurry up! Turn around!

1387
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:40,729
- You know who this truck belong to?
- Yeah, it belong to me.

1388
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:45,399
Us. It's our first bust.
As the brothers-in-law.

1389
01:16:45,499 --> 01:16:48,436
- Get to the back.
- Right. I'm on it.

1390
01:16:52,473 --> 01:16:54,476
Open it up!

1391
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:06,453
All right, Ben? Let me
know what we got, partner!

1392
01:17:06,553 --> 01:17:08,598
Is it my birthday?

1393
01:17:08,698 --> 01:17:11,802
- No!
- Okay, it must be Christmas!

1394
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,230
What we got?

1395
01:17:17,531 --> 01:17:19,768
Department's about
to get sued for harassment.

1396
01:17:19,868 --> 01:17:21,970
And I get to explain
to the new port commissioner

1397
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:24,138
why we've made a mess of his front yard!

1398
01:17:24,238 --> 01:17:27,908
We had good intel. It was an unregistered,
off-the-books shipment.

1399
01:17:28,008 --> 01:17:29,515
It was a clerical error.

1400
01:17:29,615 --> 01:17:32,747
I really don't understand what I gotta do

1401
01:17:32,847 --> 01:17:35,583
to get off whatever shit list
I seem to be on here.

1402
01:17:35,683 --> 01:17:39,386
- Mr. Pope, let me apologize.
- See, I don't get it.

1403
01:17:39,486 --> 01:17:42,423
I've tried to be nice.
I've tried to be cool.

1404
01:17:42,523 --> 01:17:45,327
Did I press charges when you
three crashed my party? No.

1405
01:17:46,127 --> 01:17:49,597
But now... See, now I'm pissed.

1406
01:17:49,697 --> 01:17:51,966
I have a reputation to protect.

1407
01:17:52,766 --> 01:17:57,005
This is gonna come out weird,
but I'm really, really rich.

1408
01:17:57,105 --> 01:18:01,375
I mean, I make sick money.
And do you know what that money buys me?

1409
01:18:03,411 --> 01:18:05,080
Access.

1410
01:18:07,214 --> 01:18:10,252
So, you can imagine
that I have already begun

1411
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:12,820
to make calls up the chain of command.

1412
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:18,025
So, James, it looks to me
like your training day is officially over.

1413
01:18:18,125 --> 01:18:23,665
But, hey, good luck on your
future careers, or... whatever.

1414
01:18:30,137 --> 01:18:32,840
Captain! Can I have a word?

1415
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:39,714
You, come with me. You can help me
explain this mess to the new commissioner.

1416
01:18:40,749 --> 01:18:42,484
Shit.

1417
01:18:43,785 --> 01:18:46,320
- Ouch.
- That went really badly.

1418
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:48,289
It's kind of hard to think of any outcome

1419
01:18:48,389 --> 01:18:50,825
that's gonna be worse
than that, right there.

1420
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:56,730
It's about to get worse.

1421
01:18:57,030 --> 01:18:58,667
- Hello?
- Milk run?

1422
01:18:58,767 --> 01:19:01,903
I'm gonna assume you've been chewed out
already, so I'm gonna save my voice.

1423
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:04,038
James, we're talking about
a lengthy suspension.

1424
01:19:04,138 --> 01:19:06,740
Ben, you're still probationary,
so there's really no choice.

1425
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,909
Wait, Lieutenant Brooks. Now, hold on now.

1426
01:19:09,009 --> 01:19:11,779
There'll be a hearing, but it's just
a formality. You're done as a cop, Ben.

1427
01:19:11,879 --> 01:19:13,715
Like "done" done?

1428
01:19:13,815 --> 01:19:15,750
Lieutenant, you don't wanna
hear my side of the story?

1429
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:17,385
No! Just get your asses back here!

1430
01:19:17,485 --> 01:19:19,587
- Please don't do this.
- You did this!

1431
01:19:19,687 --> 01:19:22,990
- You and James.
- Lieutenant. Lieut...

1432
01:19:24,057 --> 01:19:25,960
Here, man.

1433
01:19:37,938 --> 01:19:41,109
What the hell did we miss?

1434
01:19:41,209 --> 01:19:43,944
I know that shipment ain't nothing
but a front to move coke.

1435
01:19:44,044 --> 01:19:47,015
Yeah, but the containers was empty, James.

1436
01:19:47,115 --> 01:19:50,019
Maybe the container was made of coke.

1437
01:19:50,919 --> 01:19:54,455
I'll put a pin in that.
I gotta use the bathroom so bad.

1438
01:19:57,124 --> 01:19:58,960
This is Ange.

1439
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:01,930
- Hey, what's up, babe?
- Ben, I need you here now.

1440
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:03,731
- Angela?
- Cori is driving me crazy.

1441
01:20:03,831 --> 01:20:05,500
- You said two days.
- I know.

1442
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,868
I'm marrying someone on Saturday.

1443
01:20:07,968 --> 01:20:11,072
- I'd prefer it to be you.
- The whole thing just went pear-shaped.

1444
01:20:11,172 --> 01:20:13,942
We took a swing and we missed bad, Ange.
We missed real bad.

1445
01:20:15,342 --> 01:20:16,578
I am so sorry.

1446
01:20:16,678 --> 01:20:19,948
But no matter how bad it went,
I still have faith in you.

1447
01:20:20,048 --> 01:20:22,516
I appreciate that, babe, but you got...

1448
01:20:22,616 --> 01:20:26,921
And I always will.
We can get through anything together.

1449
01:20:28,789 --> 01:20:32,560
I just want you to know that I love you.
I love you so much.

1450
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:34,696
Love you.

1451
01:20:38,999 --> 01:20:40,536
I was about to tell her I lost my job,

1452
01:20:40,636 --> 01:20:43,171
but I started thinking,
"No, just wait till you get home because..."

1453
01:20:43,271 --> 01:20:46,608
Hey, guys. I was just thinking about
the port commissioner's replacement.

1454
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:49,411
It's weird how he showed up
on the bridge right after Pope.

1455
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:51,412
- So?
- You don't kill the port commissioner

1456
01:20:51,512 --> 01:20:54,680
if you don't control the replacement.

1457
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:56,687
- Makes sense.
- That makes a lot of sense.

1458
01:20:56,787 --> 01:21:00,125
Jukebox is ready. Got that Taylor
Swift song you wanted, player.

1459
01:21:00,225 --> 01:21:02,421
Look, if NuÃ±ez is in on it,

1460
01:21:02,521 --> 01:21:05,059
that means Pope is moving
contraband through the port.

1461
01:21:05,159 --> 01:21:07,599
NuÃ±ez? Charlie NuÃ±ez?

1462
01:21:07,699 --> 01:21:11,439
That was one of the names on Pope's
payroll report on his computer.

1463
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:17,109
- Was that important?
- Asshole played us.

1464
01:21:17,209 --> 01:21:19,106
He planted the info on his computer,

1465
01:21:19,206 --> 01:21:21,643
let us find that container,
got us to prove his innocence

1466
01:21:21,743 --> 01:21:23,645
so that the other containers
could skate through.

1467
01:21:23,745 --> 01:21:25,846
- Son of a bitch.
- When is the next shipment, A.J.?

1468
01:21:25,946 --> 01:21:27,582
One every morning this week.

1469
01:21:27,682 --> 01:21:30,217
- We gotta hit him in the morning then.
- Let's do it!

1470
01:21:30,317 --> 01:21:32,120
- Let's do it!
- Let's go.

1471
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:34,655
- I should have put that together.
- Let me talk to you.

1472
01:21:34,755 --> 01:21:37,458
James? Look, I knew about the containers.

1473
01:21:37,558 --> 01:21:39,226
But my thing is,
I didn't think further than that.

1474
01:21:39,326 --> 01:21:41,462
- That's where I went wrong.
- Ben, I just want to...

1475
01:21:41,562 --> 01:21:43,730
You don't have to say it.
I already know what you're gonna say.

1476
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:47,569
Listen, man, I just brought you
over here to tell you you're not going.

1477
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:49,970
What are you talking about? I am going.

1478
01:21:50,070 --> 01:21:52,140
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am, James.

1479
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,576
No, you're not!
You just got kicked off the force.

1480
01:21:54,676 --> 01:21:57,945
James, I've been out here
putting my life on the line

1481
01:21:58,045 --> 01:22:00,147
to prove to you that I can be a detective.

1482
01:22:00,247 --> 01:22:03,150
I don't know what your real problem is,
James, but this is what I wanna...

1483
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:07,188
Listen! You getting married to my sister.

1484
01:22:07,288 --> 01:22:10,158
This thing goes wrong,
you can end up in jail.

1485
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:11,993
Or worse.

1486
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:14,696
You can end up dead.

1487
01:22:18,766 --> 01:22:21,269
I'm sorry, Ben,
but this is for your own good.

1488
01:22:21,369 --> 01:22:23,237
They're not gonna let us
within a mile of the port.

1489
01:22:23,337 --> 01:22:25,773
- We gotta take a boat and head north.
- You got a boat?

1490
01:22:25,873 --> 01:22:27,908
James! Hey, stop! James!

1491
01:22:28,008 --> 01:22:30,244
- I'll tell you how it goes.
- What... A.J. A.J.

1492
01:22:30,344 --> 01:22:33,115
A.J. A.J. A.J.! A.J.!

1493
01:22:40,855 --> 01:22:43,824
Look, our best bet is to take
a boat across the bay at dawn.

1494
01:22:43,924 --> 01:22:46,761
So your captain just lets you take out
cars and boats whenever you want to?

1495
01:22:46,861 --> 01:22:48,997
I don't know. I don't ask him.

1496
01:22:54,817 --> 01:22:56,521
Come on.

1497
01:22:58,873 --> 01:23:00,574
Hey, don't shoot me, man!

1498
01:23:00,674 --> 01:23:02,577
- Ain't nobody gonna shoot you.
- Show me your hands.

1499
01:23:02,677 --> 01:23:04,177
Stop it! Come on, get up!
I need your help.

1500
01:23:04,277 --> 01:23:06,080
For what?

1501
01:23:35,142 --> 01:23:37,913
All right, A.J. When we get up here,
I need you to hide.

1502
01:23:50,524 --> 01:23:52,593
Okay.

1503
01:23:52,893 --> 01:23:55,697
What do you wanna do?
Slice his hamstrings, take him down?

1504
01:23:55,797 --> 01:23:58,666
That's a bit aggressive.

1505
01:23:58,766 --> 01:24:00,869
I think there's a different way
we could do this.

1506
01:24:14,715 --> 01:24:19,020
Hey, do you know where South Beach is?
'Cause my GPS ain't working worth a d...

1507
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,954
That is pretty impressive.

1508
01:24:21,054 --> 01:24:22,789
- Wanna give it a try?
- Can I get him under here?

1509
01:24:22,889 --> 01:24:25,226
Now twist.

1510
01:24:25,326 --> 01:24:27,862
- Right?
- Yeah. You know, I gotta do this on Ben.

1511
01:24:27,962 --> 01:24:31,064
Let me show you
how we do it in the "A" though.

1512
01:24:31,164 --> 01:24:32,633
Yeah. Well, that works too.

1513
01:24:44,078 --> 01:24:46,881
- We got him.
- Send a car over to pick up Pope's ass.

1514
01:24:46,981 --> 01:24:49,216
- I'm already here.
- Freeze!

1515
01:24:49,316 --> 01:24:51,386
As a matter of fact, I'm everywhere.

1516
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:57,257
- Psst.
- God!

1517
01:24:57,357 --> 01:24:59,260
You scared the shit out of me.
How'd you get out of...

1518
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,363
Don't worry about it.
Where's James and Maya at?

1519
01:25:01,463 --> 01:25:03,120
Checking a container somewhere over there.

1520
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:06,219
The container yard.
This is classic boss level.

1521
01:25:06,319 --> 01:25:08,703
Something always goes down
in the container yard.

1522
01:25:08,803 --> 01:25:12,806
And it's not just cocaine.
I'm opening a contraband superhighway.

1523
01:25:12,906 --> 01:25:16,277
Guns, drugs, freaking whale meat.
Whatever.

1524
01:25:16,377 --> 01:25:20,148
I think there's even
a pygmy giraffe in one of these.

1525
01:25:20,248 --> 01:25:23,384
Fun. I had to come down
to see it for myself.

1526
01:25:23,484 --> 01:25:25,053
And look what I find.

1527
01:25:27,555 --> 01:25:29,991
Shit. Pope's got 'em.

1528
01:25:30,991 --> 01:25:33,295
You stay here. I got an idea.

1529
01:25:38,599 --> 01:25:42,302
You look discouraged.
I feel bad for you guys.

1530
01:25:42,402 --> 01:25:45,073
It's like when my nephew
loses a soccer game.

1531
01:25:45,173 --> 01:25:48,242
I wanna give you a hug and a Capri Sun.

1532
01:25:48,342 --> 01:25:49,911
But I feel worse for these guys.

1533
01:25:50,011 --> 01:25:53,948
They have to kill two rogue cops
who they mistook for terrorists.

1534
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:56,484
Uncool. They have to live with that.

1535
01:26:01,521 --> 01:26:03,690
I have a better idea.

1536
01:26:03,790 --> 01:26:07,329
How 'bout having a professional
take care of it?

1537
01:26:09,396 --> 01:26:11,432
Ben Barber, bitches!

1538
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:21,276
Hold up, James! I got it! Yeah!

1539
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:31,253
Did I do that?

1540
01:26:34,722 --> 01:26:36,156
Shit!

1541
01:26:40,526 --> 01:26:42,436
Shit!

1542
01:26:43,597 --> 01:26:46,266
Backup! I need backup!

1543
01:26:46,366 --> 01:26:48,502
Help! Help!

1544
01:26:48,602 --> 01:26:51,005
Hey! Hurt Locker! God!

1545
01:27:17,330 --> 01:27:19,100
Maya, down!

1546
01:27:23,236 --> 01:27:24,873
You're welcome. Let's go.

1547
01:27:26,339 --> 01:27:30,344
You have been a real nuisance.

1548
01:27:30,444 --> 01:27:33,247
I swear, I'm a double-secret spy.

1549
01:27:33,347 --> 01:27:36,985
I volunteered to infiltrate
myself in the group.

1550
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,163
Shit.

1551
01:27:53,401 --> 01:27:55,503
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I won't do it again!

1552
01:28:08,414 --> 01:28:09,950
Look!

1553
01:28:18,359 --> 01:28:19,928
Here we go!

1554
01:28:29,501 --> 01:28:31,372
Shit!

1555
01:28:31,472 --> 01:28:33,208
Come on, Ben!

1556
01:28:50,290 --> 01:28:52,459
I got you now.

1557
01:28:54,495 --> 01:28:57,065
Take this, Pope!

1558
01:29:14,347 --> 01:29:16,550
All right, Pope! It's over!

1559
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:19,487
Let me see them hands! Out the cab, now!

1560
01:29:19,587 --> 01:29:20,989
Get out, Pope! Out the cab...

1561
01:29:23,723 --> 01:29:25,659
- It's clear!
- Oye, chicos.

1562
01:29:25,759 --> 01:29:28,029
Are you looking for something?

1563
01:29:28,129 --> 01:29:30,031
Put the gun down, please.

1564
01:29:30,697 --> 01:29:33,534
Put down your weapons now.

1565
01:29:36,603 --> 01:29:40,373
Now, this is the part where I needlessly
tell you that you are going to die.

1566
01:29:40,473 --> 01:29:42,009
Blah, blah, blah.

1567
01:29:42,109 --> 01:29:44,145
But of course, you already know that.

1568
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:48,416
So, which one of you
would like to go first?

1569
01:29:48,516 --> 01:29:51,018
James, let's start with you.

1570
01:30:02,596 --> 01:30:05,533
Ben! Why'd you do that, man?

1571
01:30:05,633 --> 01:30:10,070
You're always trying some Assassin's
Creed, Call of Duty stuff.

1572
01:30:11,804 --> 01:30:14,607
Got on a vest. You got on a vest?

1573
01:30:16,243 --> 01:30:19,180
See that? We protect each other, James.

1574
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:21,748
I don't know about that. Technically,
you got a vest on.

1575
01:30:21,848 --> 01:30:25,752
- I definitely saved your life, man.
- Don't go too far now.

1576
01:30:25,852 --> 01:30:27,755
- He could've shot me in the damn head.
- He didn't.

1577
01:30:27,855 --> 01:30:30,024
Maya, did I save his life?

1578
01:30:30,124 --> 01:30:31,693
- Maybe a little.
- Thank you.

1579
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:48,309
James!

1580
01:30:55,249 --> 01:30:57,717
It's clear!

1581
01:30:57,817 --> 01:31:00,186
You know what?
You might have saved my life that time.

1582
01:31:00,286 --> 01:31:02,322
- I'm telling Angela.
- Come on, walk it off.

1583
01:31:03,656 --> 01:31:05,359
- I can't walk.
- Rub some dirt on it.

1584
01:31:05,459 --> 01:31:07,494
Don't put no dirt on no bullet holes.

1585
01:31:07,594 --> 01:31:10,065
- Hey, man, we the brothers-in-law!
- Not anymore.

1586
01:31:11,799 --> 01:31:14,702
Offer is off the table.

1587
01:31:14,802 --> 01:31:18,738
No brother-in-law of mine
would do that to me.

1588
01:31:18,838 --> 01:31:21,075
You tried to kill me.

1589
01:31:21,575 --> 01:31:25,813
You took down a drug dealer and a crooked
politician in three days. I'm impressed.

1590
01:31:25,913 --> 01:31:27,715
- I know.
- That's how we do it in Atlanta, Cap.

1591
01:31:27,815 --> 01:31:30,384
- It's a pleasure.
- Thanks, Captain.

1592
01:31:30,484 --> 01:31:32,486
- Thanks for everything, Cap.
- Good luck, guys.

1593
01:31:33,887 --> 01:31:35,622
Okay, we got eight hours to make it back.

1594
01:31:35,722 --> 01:31:37,859
The only way we're gonna
make it back is by plane.

1595
01:31:37,959 --> 01:31:40,261
- Do I look like a bird?
- Stop, I'm serious.

1596
01:31:40,361 --> 01:31:42,328
- That's the only way we're going
to make it back. - I don't fly.

1597
01:31:42,428 --> 01:31:45,565
- This is my wedding, James.
- Hey!

1598
01:31:45,665 --> 01:31:48,802
After all that, you guys were gonna
leave without saying anything?

1599
01:31:48,902 --> 01:31:51,538
We was actually trying to figure out
how we was gonna get back.

1600
01:31:51,638 --> 01:31:54,174
Figured that. So I got you something.

1601
01:31:56,343 --> 01:31:59,712
- It's one of Pope's cars.
- My God!

1602
01:31:59,812 --> 01:32:02,283
- Let me have it. James.
- It's nice.

1603
01:32:02,383 --> 01:32:05,586
- Bring it back with no bullet holes.
- Man!

1604
01:32:06,286 --> 01:32:08,456
James! You gotta make her
your "plus-one," James!

1605
01:32:08,556 --> 01:32:10,858
Ask her how to open it.
I don't see the handle.

1606
01:32:10,958 --> 01:32:13,493
You've got to let me drive this! Whoo!

1607
01:32:13,593 --> 01:32:15,995
- So...
- Sure.

1608
01:32:18,499 --> 01:32:21,502
You were inviting me
to the wedding, right?

1609
01:32:21,602 --> 01:32:23,737
- I guess so.
- I answered too quick, didn't I?

1610
01:32:23,837 --> 01:32:26,106
- When I said "Sure"?
- It's okay.

1611
01:32:26,206 --> 01:32:29,342
I was waiting for you to...
But I thought that you...

1612
01:32:29,442 --> 01:32:30,744
Sorry.

1613
01:32:33,246 --> 01:32:34,516
See you later.

1614
01:32:35,348 --> 01:32:36,817
- James.
- What?

1615
01:32:36,917 --> 01:32:39,819
- How do I... Hey, I gotta drive this.
- You don't need to open it.

1616
01:32:39,919 --> 01:32:41,689
- No, I'm gonna drive.
- Give me the key.

1617
01:32:41,789 --> 01:32:43,858
- Don't play with me.
- I'm-a drive this time.

1618
01:32:43,958 --> 01:32:45,994
- Give me that damn key.
- James, I'm not gonna do this.

1619
01:32:46,094 --> 01:32:49,229
- Are you serious right now?
- Give me the damn key!

1620
01:32:49,329 --> 01:32:50,730
Get off! Maya, call the cops!

1621
01:32:50,830 --> 01:32:53,734
James, you better wait.
Wait till I get in.

1622
01:32:53,834 --> 01:32:57,672
Maya, this is great!
Hey, I'll see you at the wedding!

1623
01:32:59,539 --> 01:33:02,475
Here I come, Angela!

1624
01:33:02,575 --> 01:33:04,477
Yeah!

1625
01:33:08,648 --> 01:33:10,850
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you

1626
01:33:10,950 --> 01:33:13,520
Mr. and Mrs. Black Hammer.

1627
01:33:14,554 --> 01:33:16,691
Black Hammer!

1628
01:33:18,091 --> 01:33:20,261
James, come here.

1629
01:33:20,361 --> 01:33:22,897
I'm your brother-in-law.

1630
01:33:27,735 --> 01:33:29,770
I did it!

1631
01:33:29,870 --> 01:33:32,338
- I love you.
- I love you.

1632
01:33:32,438 --> 01:33:35,708
Hey, Cori, I just wanted to say thank you.

1633
01:33:35,808 --> 01:33:38,378
- You did a really amazing job.
- I did a what?

1634
01:33:38,478 --> 01:33:40,881
- You did an amazing job.
- You don't have to tell me that.

1635
01:33:40,981 --> 01:33:43,985
The fact that you think I couldn't do it
makes me want to hit you in your sack.

1636
01:33:44,085 --> 01:33:47,220
- What?
- But you know what? It's your day. Enjoy it.

1637
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:48,457
Working it...

1638
01:33:48,557 --> 01:33:51,324
We're low on run. We should go on a rum.

1639
01:33:51,424 --> 01:33:54,828
- What are you doing? I didn't invite you, man.
- Okay, I'll get it myself.

1640
01:33:54,928 --> 01:33:57,664
Happy Kwanzaa, Ben. Sorry for your loss.

1641
01:33:57,764 --> 01:34:01,769
- AssFace, let me borrow your keys!
- It's a wedding, A.J. Ain't nobody die.

1642
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:06,175
Thank you, babe.

1643
01:34:06,275 --> 01:34:08,408
Stop, guys.

1644
01:34:08,508 --> 01:34:10,610
Look, I should have told you earlier,
but I didn't.

1645
01:34:10,710 --> 01:34:12,912
I'm glad you decided to finally join us.

1646
01:34:13,012 --> 01:34:16,483
You look really nice today.
Like, handsome.

1647
01:34:16,583 --> 01:34:18,484
- Ben.
- No, it's okay.

1648
01:34:18,584 --> 01:34:20,520
- It's a compliment. Just take it.
- Not really a compliment.

1649
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:23,556
You need to accept it because
you're not gonna get many from him.

1650
01:34:23,656 --> 01:34:26,894
About to get on the boat
and drive off with my wife.

1651
01:34:26,994 --> 01:34:30,129
You wanna say anything nice to me,
this would be the time.

1652
01:34:31,248 --> 01:34:34,268
- Bye.
- You wanna say something?

1653
01:34:34,368 --> 01:34:36,804
- Good-bye.
- James wants to make a toast! Go ahead!

1654
01:34:36,904 --> 01:34:38,738
- Toast!
- Toast! You said it.

1655
01:34:38,838 --> 01:34:41,440
Toast! Toast! Toast! Toast!

1656
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:45,113
- Come on, big guy. Toast.
- Toast.

1657
01:34:46,512 --> 01:34:48,748
To Ben. You've set me on fire,

1658
01:34:48,848 --> 01:34:50,850
- stabbed me...
- You stabbed him?

1659
01:34:50,950 --> 01:34:53,987
- It was a accident.
- Got two of my cars blown up.

1660
01:34:54,221 --> 01:34:57,858
And almost got me killed
more times than I can count.

1661
01:34:57,958 --> 01:35:00,594
Now, usually, I'd toss him off the dock,

1662
01:35:00,694 --> 01:35:02,829
but in this case...

1663
01:35:03,529 --> 01:35:05,464
I can't do that.

1664
01:35:05,833 --> 01:35:08,334
'Cause, dude, you saved my life,

1665
01:35:08,434 --> 01:35:12,038
made my sister happier
than I've ever seen her.

1666
01:35:13,038 --> 01:35:16,877
- Don't you do this to me, James. Not here.
- And in a crazy kinda way...

1667
01:35:16,977 --> 01:35:19,712
made me a better person and a better cop.

1668
01:35:20,745 --> 01:35:23,516
- Fight it, Ben.
- To my brother-in-law.

1669
01:35:23,616 --> 01:35:25,652
Family.

1670
01:35:26,152 --> 01:35:28,021
You finally said "family," James.

1671
01:35:28,121 --> 01:35:31,690
- To Ben and Angela.
- Ben and Angela!

1672
01:35:33,025 --> 01:35:36,359
You are something else, buddy.
Come on, Ange.

1673
01:35:36,459 --> 01:35:39,133
- You ready?
- Yes!

1674
01:35:43,802 --> 01:35:46,006
- You hear that?
- I hear it.

1675
01:35:47,407 --> 01:35:50,243
It's like a Le Tigre.
That's French for "puma."

1676
01:35:50,343 --> 01:35:51,578
It's not actually.

1677
01:35:51,678 --> 01:35:56,117
Just go with the moment. People back
there want a show. Let's give 'em one.

1678
01:35:56,217 --> 01:35:57,752
- Baby, you know what I want?
- What?

1679
01:35:57,852 --> 01:36:01,055
- The Black Hammer. - Then we need
to get this boat out of here then.

1680
01:36:02,021 --> 01:36:03,590
Bye!

1681
01:36:06,126 --> 01:36:07,355
Ben, I like this.

1682
01:36:07,455 --> 01:36:09,902
Before we go, let's loop
back around one more time.

1683
01:36:10,002 --> 01:36:12,865
- I'm-a show 'em what we capable of, baby!
- Slow down a little bit.

1684
01:36:12,965 --> 01:36:15,869
You ain't got nothing to worry about!
You with the Black Hammer!

1685
01:36:15,969 --> 01:36:18,606
- There's a boat right in front of us.
- I know how to drive this boat!

1686
01:36:18,706 --> 01:36:21,129
That's the first thing they teach you.

1687
01:36:24,211 --> 01:36:26,880
Ben, hold on! Hold on!

1688
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:29,850
Angela! Stop the boat!

1689
01:36:33,486 --> 01:36:36,123
Ben, how do I stop this thing?

1690
01:36:36,422 --> 01:36:38,458
- Angela!
- What?

1691
01:36:38,558 --> 01:36:41,494
- This marriage will never last.
- Let's just pray for him.

1692
01:36:41,594 --> 01:36:43,463
- Can he swim?
- I hope not.

1693
01:36:43,563 --> 01:36:45,399
Stop the boat!

1694
01:36:45,499 --> 01:36:48,969
- James!
- Welcome to the family, brother-in-law!

1695
01:36:49,069 --> 01:36:52,106
Angela! Are you trying to kill me?

1696
01:36:54,974 --> 01:36:56,777
Dodge the buoys!
