1
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,630
Freddy, go and find a cab.

2
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,424
Do you want me to catch pneumonia?

3
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,855
Don't just stand there, Freddy.
Go and find a cab.

4
00:05:15,147 --> 00:05:17,525
All right, I'll get one.

5
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:36,419
Look where you're goin', dear.
Look where you're goin'!

6
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,795
I'm so sorry.

7
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,841
Two bunches o' violets trod in the mud.
A full day's wages.

8
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,387
-Freddy, go and find a cab.
-Yes, Mother.

9
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,309
He's your son, is he?

10
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,686
If you'd done your duty
as a mother should...

11
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:57,690
...you wouldn't let 'im spoil a poor girl's
flow'rs and run away without payin'.

12
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,734
Go about your business, my girl.

13
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,611
And you wouldn't go off
without payin', either.

14
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,781
Two bunches o' violets trod in the mud.

15
00:06:08,617 --> 00:06:11,495
Sir, is there any sign of it stopping?

16
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,040
I'm afraid not. It's worse than before.

17
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:16,542
If it's worse, it's a sign it's nearly over.

18
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,420
Cheer up, Capt'n,
buy a flow'r off a poor girl.

19
00:06:19,503 --> 00:06:20,921
I'm sorry, I haven't any change.

20
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,632
I can change 'alf a crown.
Take this for tuppence.

21
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,177
I told you, I'm awfully sorry.
Wait a minute.

22
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,513
Oh, yes. Here's three ha' pence,
if that's any use to you.

23
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:30,973
Thank you, sir.

24
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,233
You be careful.
Better give 'im a flower for it.

25
00:06:41,358 --> 00:06:43,319
There's a bloke here behind that pillar...

26
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:46,238
...takin' down every blessed word
you're sayin'.

27
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,411
I ain't done nothin' wrong
by speakin' to the gentleman.

28
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,247
I've a right to sell flow'rs
if I keep off the curb.

29
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,500
I'm a respectable girl, so help me.

30
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:01,170
I never spoke to him except to ask him
to buy a flow'r off me.

31
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:03,798
-What's the bloomin' noise?
-A tec's takin' her down.

32
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,716
I'm makin' an honest livin'.

33
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,802
Who's doing all that shouting?

34
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,556
Sir, don't let 'im charge me.
You dunno what it means to me.

35
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,643
They'll take away me character
and drive me on the streets...

36
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,394
...for speakin' to gentlemen.

37
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:21,315
There, there. Who's hurting you,
you silly girl? What'd you take me for?

38
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,275
On my Bible oath, I never spoke a word.

39
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,277
Shut up! Do I look like a policeman?

40
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:28,697
Why'd ya take down me words?
'Ow do I know you took me down right?

41
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,283
You just show me
what you wrote ab'ut me.

42
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,293
That ain't proper writin'. I can't read it.

43
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,336
I can.

44
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:46,465
'"l say, Capt'n,
now buy a flow'r off a poor girl.'"

45
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,221
Oh, it's cause I called him '"Capt'n.'"

46
00:07:52,846 --> 00:07:57,101
I meant no 'arm. Sir, don't let him lay
a charge against me for a word like that.

47
00:07:57,184 --> 00:08:00,604
I'll make no charge.
Really, sir, if you are a detective...

48
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,816
...you needn't protect me
against molestation from young women...

49
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:04,817
...until I ask you.

50
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,278
Anyone could tell the girl meant no harm.

51
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:10,447
He ain't no tec. He's a gentleman.
Look at his boots.

52
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,533
How are all your people down at Selsey?

53
00:08:12,616 --> 00:08:15,077
Who told you my people
come from Selsey?

54
00:08:15,202 --> 00:08:16,745
Never mind, they do.

55
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:21,292
How do you come to be up so far east?
You were born in Lisson Grove.

56
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:25,629
What 'arm is there
in my leavin' Lisson Grove?

57
00:08:25,754 --> 00:08:28,966
It weren't fit for pigs to live.
I had to pay four and six a week.

58
00:08:29,049 --> 00:08:30,801
Live where you like but stop that noise!

59
00:08:30,884 --> 00:08:34,430
Come, come, he can't touch you.
You've a right to live where you please.

60
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:36,390
I'm a good girl, I am.

61
00:08:36,932 --> 00:08:39,351
-Where do I come from?
-Hawkestone.

62
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:42,187
Who said I didn't?
Blimey, you know everything, you do.

63
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:45,441
You, sir, do you think
you could find me a taxi?

64
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,609
Madam, it's stopped raining.

65
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,195
You can get a motorbus to Hampton Court.

66
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,031
Isn't that where you live?

67
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,824
What impertinence!

68
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:57,828
Tell 'im where he comes from,
if you wanta go fortune-telling.

69
00:08:59,955 --> 00:09:02,750
Cheltenham, Harrow...

70
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,753
...Cambridge and...

71
00:09:07,796 --> 00:09:08,881
...lndia?

72
00:09:08,964 --> 00:09:10,132
Quite right.

73
00:09:10,507 --> 00:09:12,843
He ain't a tec, he's a bloomin' busybody.

74
00:09:12,926 --> 00:09:15,763
Do you do this sort of thing
for a living at a music hall?

75
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,973
I have thought of it.
Perhaps I will one day.

76
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:21,393
He's no gentleman, he ain't,
to interfere with a poor girl!

77
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,187
How do you do it, may I ask?

78
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:28,150
Simple phonetics. The science of speech.
That's my profession. Also my hobby.

79
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:31,695
Anyone can spot an lrishman
or a Yorkshireman by his brogue...

80
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,906
...but I can place a man within six miles.

81
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:37,826
I can place 'im within two miles in London.
Sometimes within two streets.

82
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:40,746
Ought to be ashamed of 'imself,
unmanly coward.

83
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:42,706
-Is there a living in that?
-Oh, yes.

84
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,126
Let him mind his own business
and leave a poor girl alone.

85
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,171
Cease this detestable
boohooing instantly...

86
00:09:49,296 --> 00:09:52,174
...or else seek the shelter
of some other place of worship!

87
00:09:52,966 --> 00:09:55,844
I have a right to be here if I like,
same as you!

88
00:09:56,136 --> 00:09:58,889
A woman who utters such disgusting,
depressing noises...

89
00:09:58,972 --> 00:10:01,517
...has no right to be anywhere,
no right to live.

90
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,393
Remember, you're a human with a soul...

91
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:06,146
...and the divine gift of articulate speech.

92
00:10:06,313 --> 00:10:09,316
Your native language is the language
of Shakespeare and...

93
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:13,570
...Milton and the Bible. Don't sit there
crooning like a bilious pigeon.

In six months I could pass her off
as a duchess at an Embassy Ball.

143
00:13:03,406 --> 00:13:06,409
I could get her a job as a lady's maid

You incarnate insult

I could pass you off as the Queen of Sheba.

You don't believe that, Capt'n?

151
00:13:26,763 --> 00:13:30,350
Anything's possible.
I, myself, am a student of lndian dialects.

164

You ought to be stuffed with nails,
you ought!

-How many are there actually?
-How many what?

168
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:24,696
Indian dialects?

169
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:29,117
No fewer than 147 distinct languages
are recorded as vernacular in lndia.

170
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,714
Shouldn't we stand up, gentlemen?
We've got a bloomin' heiress in our midst.

171
00:14:43,214 --> 00:14:45,467
Would you be lookin'
for a good butler, Eliza?

172
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,218

It's nearly 5:00.
My daughter Eliza'll be along soon.

225
00:19:50,897 --> 00:19:54,066
She ought to be good for 'alf a crown
for a father that loves 'er.

226
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,986
That's a laugh.
You ain't been near 'er for months.

00:19:57,069 --> 00:20:00,865
What's that got to do with it?
What's 'alf a crown after all I've give 'er?

228
00:20:00,948 --> 00:20:02,992
When did you ever give 'er anythin'?

229
00:20:03,075 --> 00:20:05,244
Anythin'? I give 'er everythin'.

230
00:20:05,328 --> 00:20:09,123
I give 'er the greatest gift
any human being can give to another:

231
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:10,208
Life!

232
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:15,004
I introduced 'er to this here planet, I did,
with all its wonders and marvels.

233
00:20:15,171 --> 00:20:17,715
The sun that shines, the moon that glows.

234
00:20:17,924 --> 00:20:20,801
Hyde Park to walk through
on a fine spring night.

235
00:20:21,177 --> 00:20:25,514
The 'ole ruddy city o' London to roam
around in sellin' 'er bloomin' flow'rs.

236
00:20:25,723 --> 00:20:27,224
I give 'er all that.

237
00:20:28,017 --> 00:20:30,895
Then I disappears and leaves 'er
on 'er own to enjoy it.

238
00:20:30,978 --> 00:20:33,272
If that ain't worth 'alf a crown
now and again...

239
00:20:33,356 --> 00:20:35,524
...l'll take my belt off and give 'er what for.

240
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:38,819
You got a good 'eart.
But you want a 'alf a crown out o' Eliza...

241
00:20:38,903 --> 00:20:40,613
...you better have a good story.

242
00:20:40,696 --> 00:20:42,448
Leave that to me, my boy.

243
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:46,202
-Good mornin', George.
-Not a brass farthin'.

244
00:20:53,376 --> 00:20:55,211
Not a brass farthin'.

245
00:22:16,459 --> 00:22:17,668
There she is.

246
00:22:26,177 --> 00:22:28,471
Why, Liza, what a surprise.

247
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,391
Hop along, Charlie, you're too old for me.

248
00:22:32,808 --> 00:22:35,728
-Don't you know your daughter?
-You don't know what she looks like.

249
00:22:35,811 --> 00:22:38,647
I know 'er, I know 'er.
Come on, I'll find 'er.

250
00:23:08,052 --> 00:23:09,595
Eliza, what a surprise.

251
00:23:09,678 --> 00:23:11,263
Not a brass farthin'.

252
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,641
Hey, you come 'ere, Eliza.

253
00:23:13,849 --> 00:23:16,101
I ain't gonna take me 'ard-earned wages...

254
00:23:16,185 --> 00:23:19,063
...and let you pass 'em on
to a bloody pubkeeper.

255
00:23:26,362 --> 00:23:29,406
You wouldn't send me 'ome
to your stepmother...

256
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:32,493
...without a drop o' liquid protection,
would ya?

257
00:23:32,576 --> 00:23:34,578
Stepmother, indeed!

258
00:23:34,787 --> 00:23:37,915
Well, I'm willin' to marry 'er.
It's me that suffers by it.

259
00:23:37,998 --> 00:23:40,084
I'm a slave to that woman, Eliza.

260
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:43,128
Just because I ain't 'er lawful 'usband.

261
00:23:43,337 --> 00:23:44,380
Come on.

262
00:23:44,463 --> 00:23:47,508
Slip your ol' dad just 'alf a crown
to go 'ome on.

263
00:23:47,841 --> 00:23:50,511
Well, I had a bit o' luck meself last night.

264
00:23:54,348 --> 00:23:57,851
But don't keep comin' around
countin' on 'alf crowns from me!

265
00:23:58,143 --> 00:24:01,146
Thank you, Eliza. You're a noble daughter.

266
00:24:04,024 --> 00:24:07,861
'"Beer, beer, glorious beer

267
00:24:08,487 --> 00:24:10,155
'"Fill yourself right up'"

268
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:32,970
See this creature
with her curbstone English...

269
00:24:33,053 --> 00:24:37,141
...that will keep her
in the gutter till the end of her days?

270
00:24:37,641 --> 00:24:41,437
In six months, I could pass her off
as a duchess at an Embassy Ball.

271
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:44,732
I could get her ajob as a lady's maid
or a shop assistant...

272
00:24:44,815 --> 00:24:46,984
...which requires better English.

273
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:58,662
You disgrace to the noble architecture
of these columns!

274
00:25:04,877 --> 00:25:07,796
I could get her ajob as a lady's maid
or a shop assistant...

275
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,048
...which requires better English.

276
00:25:36,575 --> 00:25:38,702
How many vowel sounds
did you hear altogether?

277
00:25:38,785 --> 00:25:40,496
I believe I counted 24.

278
00:25:40,621 --> 00:25:43,707
Wrong by 100. To be exact you heard 130.

279
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:45,918
Listen to them one at a time.

280
00:25:46,001 --> 00:25:49,004
Must l? I'm really quite done up
for one morning.

281
00:26:13,195 --> 00:26:14,655
Your name, please?

282
00:26:15,322 --> 00:26:16,657
Your name, miss?

283
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,660
My name is of no concern to you
whatsoever.

284
00:26:19,785 --> 00:26:21,578
One moment, please.

285
00:26:30,587 --> 00:26:33,215
London is gettin' so dirty these days.

286
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:37,010
I'm Mrs. Pearce, the housekeeper.
Can I help you?

287
00:26:37,261 --> 00:26:40,889
Good morning, missus.
I'd like to see the professor, please.

288
00:26:41,014 --> 00:26:42,599
Could you tell me what it's about?

289
00:26:42,683 --> 00:26:45,477
It's business of a personal nature.

290
00:26:47,521 --> 00:26:49,022
One moment, please.

291
00:26:58,615 --> 00:27:01,284
-Mr. Higgins?
-What is it, Mrs. Pearce?

292
00:27:01,368 --> 00:27:03,912
There's a young woman
who wants to see you, sir.

293
00:27:03,996 --> 00:27:05,205
A young woman?

294
00:27:06,373 --> 00:27:07,374
What does she want?

295
00:27:07,457 --> 00:27:10,210
She's quite a common girl, sir.
Very common indeed.

296
00:27:10,293 --> 00:27:12,337
I should've sent her away, only I thought...

297
00:27:12,421 --> 00:27:14,423
...you wanted her to talk
into your machine.

298
00:27:14,506 --> 00:27:17,300
-Has she an interesting accent?
-Simply ghastly.

299
00:27:17,384 --> 00:27:20,387
Good. Let's have her in.
Show her in, Mrs. Pearce.

300
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:24,641
This is rather a bit of luck.
I'll show you how I make records.

301
00:27:24,725 --> 00:27:28,645
We'll set her talking, then I'll take
her down first in Bell's Visible Speech...

302
00:27:28,729 --> 00:27:31,898
...then in broad Romic.
Then we'll get her on the phonograph...

303
00:27:31,982 --> 00:27:36,403
...so you can turn her on when you want
with the written transcript before you.

304
00:27:39,656 --> 00:27:41,450
This is the young woman, sir.

305
00:27:41,533 --> 00:27:42,826
Good mornin', my good man.

306
00:27:42,909 --> 00:27:44,828
Might I 'ave a word with you?

307
00:27:44,911 --> 00:27:47,414
Oh, no. This is the girl
I jotted down last night.

308
00:27:47,497 --> 00:27:50,751
She's no use. I got the records I want
of the Lisson Grove lingo.

309
00:27:50,834 --> 00:27:52,753
I won't waste another cylinder on that.

310
00:27:52,836 --> 00:27:54,463
Be off with you. I don't want you.

311
00:27:54,546 --> 00:27:57,716
Don't be so saucy.
You ain't 'eard what I come for yet.

312
00:27:57,883 --> 00:27:59,676
Did you tell 'im I come in a taxi?

313
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,804
Nonsense. Do you think a gentleman
like Mr. Higgins cares...

314
00:28:02,888 --> 00:28:04,055
...what you came in?

315
00:28:04,139 --> 00:28:05,724
Oh, we are proud.

316
00:28:05,891 --> 00:28:09,144
He ain't above givin' lessons, not 'im.
I 'eard 'im say so.

317
00:28:09,227 --> 00:28:11,313
I ain't come here to ask
for any compliment...

318
00:28:11,396 --> 00:28:14,149
...and if my money's not good enough,
I can go elsewhere.

319
00:28:14,232 --> 00:28:15,692
Good enough for what?

320
00:28:15,776 --> 00:28:17,527
Good enough for you.

321
00:28:18,653 --> 00:28:21,490
Now you know, don't ya?
I'm come to 'ave lessons.

322
00:28:21,573 --> 00:28:24,117
And to pay for 'em, too, make no mistake.

323
00:28:24,242 --> 00:28:25,243
Well!

324
00:28:26,036 --> 00:28:28,580
And what do you expect me to say?

325
00:28:29,372 --> 00:28:32,876
Well, if you was a gentleman,
you might ask me to sit down, I think.

326
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:35,670
Don't I tell you I'm bringin' you business?

327
00:28:36,421 --> 00:28:38,381
Should we ask this baggage to sit down...

328
00:28:38,465 --> 00:28:40,884
...or shall we just throw her
out of the window?

329
00:28:40,967 --> 00:28:45,013
I won't be called a baggage.
Not when I've offered to pay like any lady.

330
00:28:46,223 --> 00:28:48,016
What do you want, my girl?

331
00:28:52,145 --> 00:28:53,980
I want to be a lady in a flow'r shop...

332
00:28:54,064 --> 00:28:56,900
...'stead of sellin' at the corner
of Tottenham Court Road.

333
00:28:56,983 --> 00:28:59,736
But they won't take me
unless I can talk more genteel.

334
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:01,112
He said 'e could teach me.

335
00:29:01,196 --> 00:29:03,281
Well, 'ere I am ready to pay 'im.

336
00:29:03,365 --> 00:29:06,618
Not asking any favor
and he treats me as if I was dirt.

337
00:29:07,285 --> 00:29:11,164
I know what lessons cost as well as you do
and I'm ready to pay.

338
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:15,460
How much?

339
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,629
Now you're talkin'.

340
00:29:17,837 --> 00:29:20,382
I thought you'd come off it
for a chance to get back...

341
00:29:20,465 --> 00:29:22,592
...a bit of what you chucked
at me last night.

342
00:29:22,676 --> 00:29:24,386
You'd had a drop in, 'adn't you?

343
00:29:24,469 --> 00:29:25,679
Sit down.

344
00:29:25,804 --> 00:29:29,015
-If you're goin' t' make a compliment of it--
-Sit down!

345
00:29:29,975 --> 00:29:32,185
Sit down, girl. Do as you're told.

346
00:29:32,727 --> 00:29:34,104
What's your name?

347
00:29:34,229 --> 00:29:36,147
Eliza Doolittle.

348
00:29:36,815 --> 00:29:39,276
Won't you sit down, Miss Doolittle?

349
00:29:43,154 --> 00:29:44,739
I don't mind if I do.

350
00:29:48,285 --> 00:29:51,413
How much do you propose
to pay me for these lessons?

351
00:29:51,621 --> 00:29:53,123
Oh, I know what's right.

352
00:29:53,206 --> 00:29:56,084
My lady friend gets French lessons
for 18 pence an hour...

353
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:58,086
...from a real French gentleman.

354
00:29:58,169 --> 00:30:00,505
You wouldn't have the face
to ask me the same...

355
00:30:00,588 --> 00:30:03,425
...for teachin' me my own language
as you would for French.

356
00:30:03,508 --> 00:30:06,886
I won't give more than a shillin'.
Take it or leave it.

357
00:30:09,014 --> 00:30:12,100
Do you know, Pickering,
if you think of a shilling...

358
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:16,438
...not as a simple shilling,
but as a percentage of this girl's income...

359
00:30:16,771 --> 00:30:19,482
...it works out as fully equivalent of...

360
00:30:21,192 --> 00:30:23,653
...60 or 70 pounds from a millionaire.

361
00:30:24,487 --> 00:30:27,907
By George, it's enormous.
It's the biggest offer I ever had.

362
00:30:27,991 --> 00:30:32,203
Sixty pounds? What are you talkin' about?
Where would I get 60 pounds?

363
00:30:32,287 --> 00:30:34,664
-I never offered you 60 pounds!
-Hold your tongue!

364
00:30:34,748 --> 00:30:36,374
But I ain't got 60 pounds!

365
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:40,253
Don't cry, silly girl. Sit down.
Nobody's going to touch your money.

366
00:30:40,336 --> 00:30:43,673
Somebody'll touch you with a broomstick
if you don't stop sniveling.

367
00:30:43,757 --> 00:30:44,924
Sit down!

368
00:30:48,887 --> 00:30:51,431
Anybody'd think you was my father!

369
00:30:51,556 --> 00:30:55,185
If I decide to teach you,
I'll be worse than two fathers to you.

370
00:30:55,977 --> 00:30:56,978
Here.

371
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,313
What's this for?

372
00:30:58,396 --> 00:31:02,192
To wipe your eyes. To wipe any part
of your face that feels moist.

373
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,236
Remember, that's your handkerchief
and that's your sleeve.

374
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,907
Don't confuse one with the other,
if you want to become a lady in a shop.

375
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:12,827
It's no use to talk to her like that.
She doesn't understand you.

376
00:31:12,911 --> 00:31:16,539
Give the 'andkerchief to me.
He give it to me, not to you!

377
00:31:16,706 --> 00:31:18,708
Higgins, I'm interested.

378
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:20,168
What about your boast...

379
00:31:20,251 --> 00:31:23,129
...you could pass her off as a duchess
at the Embassy Ball?

380
00:31:23,213 --> 00:31:26,049
I'll say you're the greatest teacher alive
if you do that.

381
00:31:26,132 --> 00:31:30,261
I'll bet you all the expenses
of the experiment that you can't do it.

382
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:32,180
I'll even pay for the lessons.

383
00:31:32,263 --> 00:31:34,974
You're real good. Thank ye, Capt'n.

384
00:31:36,392 --> 00:31:38,353
It's almost irresistible.

385
00:31:41,064 --> 00:31:43,358
She's so deliciously low.

386
00:31:43,441 --> 00:31:44,984
So horribly dirty.

387
00:31:45,109 --> 00:31:48,655
I ain't dirty! I washed my face an' hands
before I come, I did.

388
00:31:48,738 --> 00:31:52,700
I'll take it. I'll make a duchess
of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.

389
00:31:53,076 --> 00:31:56,621
We'll start today. This moment.
Take her away and clean her.

390
00:31:56,704 --> 00:32:00,124
Sandpaper, if it won't come off.
Is there a fire in the kitchen?

391
00:32:00,208 --> 00:32:03,253
Take her clothes off and burn them
and order some new ones.

392
00:32:03,336 --> 00:32:05,964
Just wrap her in brown paper
till they come.

393
00:32:06,464 --> 00:32:10,051
You're no gentleman, you're not,
to talk o' such things.

394
00:32:10,134 --> 00:32:11,636
I'm a good girl, I am.

395
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:14,514
And I know what the likes of you are, I do.

396
00:32:15,181 --> 00:32:18,393
We want none of your slum prudery here,
young woman.

397
00:32:18,643 --> 00:32:20,895
You've got to learn to behave
like a duchess.

398
00:32:20,979 --> 00:32:24,440
Take her away, Mrs. Pearce.
If she gives you any trouble, wallop her.

399
00:32:24,524 --> 00:32:26,359
I'll call the police, I will.

400
00:32:26,442 --> 00:32:28,069
I've got no place to put her.

401
00:32:28,152 --> 00:32:30,113
Well, put her in the dustbin.

402
00:32:31,072 --> 00:32:33,074
Come, Higgins, be reasonable.

403
00:32:33,157 --> 00:32:35,743
You must be reasonable,
Mr. Higgins, you must.

404
00:32:35,827 --> 00:32:38,329
You can't walk over everybody like this.

405
00:32:41,082 --> 00:32:42,125
I?

406
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:44,711
Walk over everybody?

407
00:32:44,794 --> 00:32:48,965
My dear Mrs. Pearce, my dear Pickering,
I had no intention of walking over anybody.

408
00:32:49,048 --> 00:32:52,218
I merely suggested we should be kind
to this poor girl.

409
00:32:52,343 --> 00:32:56,889
I didn't express myself clearly
because I didn't wish to hurt her delicacy...

410
00:32:57,307 --> 00:32:58,433
...or yours.

411
00:32:58,516 --> 00:33:01,602
But, sir, you can't take a girl up like that...

412
00:33:01,769 --> 00:33:04,397
...as if you were picking up
a pebble on the beach.

413
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,648
Why not?

414
00:33:05,815 --> 00:33:08,609
Why not? But you don't know
anything about her.

415
00:33:08,693 --> 00:33:11,487
What about her parents?
She may be married.

416
00:33:11,696 --> 00:33:12,947
Garn!

417
00:33:13,281 --> 00:33:16,367
There. As the girl
very properly says, '"garn! '"

418
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,828
Who'd marry me?

419
00:33:21,247 --> 00:33:23,041
By George, Eliza...

420
00:33:23,833 --> 00:33:27,253
...the streets will be strewn
with the bodies of men...

421
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:31,007
...shooting themselves for your sake
before I'm done with you.

422
00:33:33,634 --> 00:33:34,802
I'm goin'.

423
00:33:35,094 --> 00:33:38,639
He's off his chump, he is.
I don't want no balmies teachin' me.

424
00:33:38,723 --> 00:33:41,893
Mad? All right, Mrs. Pearce,
don't order those new clothes.

425
00:33:41,976 --> 00:33:44,187
-Throw her out.
-Stop! I won't allow it.

426
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,772
Go home to your parents, girl.

427
00:33:45,855 --> 00:33:47,607
I ain't got no parents.

428
00:33:47,815 --> 00:33:49,734
She ain't got no parents. What's the fuss?

429
00:33:49,817 --> 00:33:53,237
Nobody wants her. She's no use
to anyone but me. Take her upstairs!

430
00:33:53,321 --> 00:33:55,782
What's to become of her?
ls she to be paid anything?

431
00:33:55,865 --> 00:33:57,450
Do be sensible, sir.

432
00:33:57,742 --> 00:34:00,244
What'd she do with money?
She'll have food and clothes.

433
00:34:00,328 --> 00:34:01,913
She'll drink if you give her money.

434
00:34:01,996 --> 00:34:03,748
You are a brute! It's a lie!

435
00:34:03,831 --> 00:34:06,334
Nobody ever saw the sign o' liquor on me.

436
00:34:06,417 --> 00:34:09,504
Sir, you're a gentleman.
Don't let 'im speak to me like that!

437
00:34:09,587 --> 00:34:12,799
Does it occur to you, Higgins,
the girl has some feelings?

438
00:34:12,882 --> 00:34:16,010
No, I don't think so.
No feelings we need worry about.

439
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:17,303
Well, have you, Eliza?

440
00:34:17,386 --> 00:34:19,722
I got me feelings same as anyone else.

441
00:34:19,806 --> 00:34:23,101
Mr. Higgins, I must know on what terms
the girl is to be here.

442
00:34:23,184 --> 00:34:25,603
What'll become of her
when you've finished teaching?

443
00:34:25,686 --> 00:34:27,522
You must look ahead a little, sir.

444
00:34:27,605 --> 00:34:30,858
What'll become of her if we leave her
in the gutter, Mrs. Pearce?

445
00:34:30,942 --> 00:34:33,277
That's her own business,
not yours, Mr. Higgins.

446
00:34:33,361 --> 00:34:34,904
When I'm done, we'll throw her back.

447
00:34:34,987 --> 00:34:38,324
Then it'll be her own business again.
That'll be all right, won't it?

448
00:34:38,407 --> 00:34:40,743
You've no feelin' 'eart in ya!

449
00:34:41,244 --> 00:34:43,746
You don't care for nothin' but yourself.

450
00:34:43,955 --> 00:34:46,165
I've 'ad enough of this. I'm goin'!

451
00:34:46,249 --> 00:34:48,292
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!

452
00:34:48,376 --> 00:34:50,294
Have some chocolates, Eliza.

453
00:34:57,051 --> 00:34:58,761
'Ow do I know what might be in 'em?

454
00:34:58,845 --> 00:35:01,973
I've 'eard of girls bein' drugged
by the likes o' you.

455
00:35:02,348 --> 00:35:03,933
Pledge of good faith.

456
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,143
I'll take one half.

457
00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:08,729
And you take the other.

458
00:35:12,191 --> 00:35:15,278
You'll have boxes of them,
barrels of them every day.

459
00:35:15,653 --> 00:35:17,363
You'll live on them, eh?

460
00:35:18,823 --> 00:35:22,368
I wouldn't 've ate it, only I'm too ladylike
to take it out o' me mouth.

461
00:35:22,451 --> 00:35:25,955
Think of it, Eliza.
Think of chocolates, and taxis...

462
00:35:26,289 --> 00:35:28,666
...and gold and diamonds.

463
00:35:30,042 --> 00:35:33,796
I don't want no gold and no diamonds.
I'm a good girl, I am.

464
00:35:34,171 --> 00:35:37,466
Higgins, I really must interfere.
Mrs. Pearce is quite right.

465
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:40,553
If this girl will put herself
in your hands for six months...

466
00:35:40,636 --> 00:35:45,182
...for an experiment in teaching, she must
understand thoroughly what she's doing.

467
00:35:49,312 --> 00:35:51,439
You are to stay here
for the next six months...

468
00:35:51,522 --> 00:35:55,526
...learning how to speak beautifully
like a lady in a florist shop.

469
00:35:56,736 --> 00:36:00,448
If you're good and do what you're told,
you'll sleep in a proper bedroom...

470
00:36:00,531 --> 00:36:04,827
...have lots to eat, money
to buy chocolates and take rides in taxis.

471
00:36:05,995 --> 00:36:08,372
But if you are naughty and idle...

472
00:36:08,456 --> 00:36:11,292
...you'll sleep in the kitchen
amongst the black beetles...

473
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:14,420
...and be walloped by Mrs. Pearce
with a broomstick.

474
00:36:15,755 --> 00:36:19,592
At the end of six months,
you shall be taken to Buckingham Palace...

475
00:36:19,925 --> 00:36:22,345
...in a carriage, beautifully dressed.

476
00:36:23,554 --> 00:36:26,515
If the king finds out
that you are not a lady...

477
00:36:26,682 --> 00:36:30,936
...the police will take you to the Tower
of London where your head will be cut off...

478
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:34,023
...as a warning to other
presumptuous flower girls.

479
00:36:35,024 --> 00:36:38,486
But if you are not found out,
you shall have a present of...

480
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:42,782
...seven and six to start life with
as a lady in a shop.

481
00:36:44,075 --> 00:36:46,035
If you refuse this offer...

482
00:36:46,118 --> 00:36:50,081
...you will be the most ungrateful,
wicked girl...

483
00:36:50,581 --> 00:36:54,126
...and the angels will weep for you!

484
00:36:59,215 --> 00:37:00,591
Are you satisfied, Pickering?

485
00:37:00,674 --> 00:37:02,760
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

486
00:37:02,843 --> 00:37:05,304
Could I put it more plainly or fairly,
Mrs. Pearce?

487
00:37:05,388 --> 00:37:06,305
Come with me.

488
00:37:06,389 --> 00:37:09,141
That's right.
Bundle her off to the bathroom.

489
00:37:09,225 --> 00:37:11,143
You're a great bully, you are!

490
00:37:11,227 --> 00:37:14,480
I won't stay here if I don't like it.
I won't let nobody wallop me!

491
00:37:14,563 --> 00:37:16,273
Don't answer back, girl.

492
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,236
I've always been a good girl, I 'ave.

493
00:37:21,403 --> 00:37:24,657
In six months...in three,
if she has a good ear and a quick tongue...

494
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,493
...l'll take her anywhere
and I'll pass her off as anything.

495
00:37:27,576 --> 00:37:30,246
I'll make a queen of that barbarous wretch!

496
00:37:37,294 --> 00:37:40,673
I've never had a bath in me life.
Not what you'd call a proper one.

497
00:37:40,756 --> 00:37:44,426
You know you can't be a nice girl inside
if you're dirty outside.

498
00:37:45,094 --> 00:37:48,305
I'll have to put you in here.
This will be your bedroom.

499
00:37:52,101 --> 00:37:54,353
I couldn't sleep in here, missus.

500
00:37:54,436 --> 00:37:56,605
It's too good for the likes o' me.

501
00:37:58,566 --> 00:38:00,651
I should be afraid to touch anythin'.

502
00:38:00,734 --> 00:38:02,820
I ain't a duchess yet, you know.

503
00:38:09,326 --> 00:38:11,829
What's this?
This where you wash clothes?

504
00:38:11,912 --> 00:38:15,958
This is where we wash ourselves, Eliza.
And where I'm going to wash you.

505
00:38:16,542 --> 00:38:19,753
You expect me to get into that
and wet meself all over?

506
00:38:19,837 --> 00:38:20,963
Not me!

507
00:38:27,428 --> 00:38:29,263
I shall catch me death.

508
00:38:31,765 --> 00:38:33,058
Come along now.

509
00:38:33,642 --> 00:38:34,810
Come along.

510
00:38:35,352 --> 00:38:36,979
Take your clothes off.

511
00:38:38,105 --> 00:38:40,941
Come on, girl, do as you're told.
Take your clothes off.

512
00:38:41,025 --> 00:38:43,402
Here, come on. Help me take these--

513
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:52,119
Take your hands off me!

514
00:39:12,056 --> 00:39:14,975
I'm a good girl, I am!

515
00:39:17,478 --> 00:39:20,356
It ain't right! It ain't decent!

516
00:39:26,695 --> 00:39:28,364
Get your hands off me!

517
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:38,165
I'm a good girl, I am!

518
00:39:52,054 --> 00:39:54,890
Forgive the bluntness,
but if I'm to be in this business...

519
00:39:54,973 --> 00:39:56,892
...l shall feel responsible for the girl.

520
00:39:56,975 --> 00:40:00,938
I hope it's clearly understood that
no advantage is to be taken of her position.

521
00:40:01,021 --> 00:40:03,690
What, that thing? Sacred, I assure you.

522
00:40:03,774 --> 00:40:06,777
Come now, you know what I mean.
This is no trifling matter.

523
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:10,322
Are you a man of good character
where women are concerned?

524
00:40:11,323 --> 00:40:14,618
Have you ever met a man of good
character where women are concerned?

525
00:40:14,701 --> 00:40:16,703
Yes, very frequently.

526
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:20,207
I haven't. The moment I let a woman
make friends with me...

527
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,584
...she becomes jealous, exacting...

528
00:40:22,668 --> 00:40:24,920
...suspicious and a damned nuisance.

529
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:29,299
The moment that I make friends with
a woman I become selfish and tyrannical.

530
00:40:29,383 --> 00:40:32,970
So here I am, a confirmed old bachelor
and likely to remain so.

531
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,222

Moved in with a swell, Eliza has.

667
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:34,993
Left here in a taxi all by herself,
smart as paint.

668
00:48:35,243 --> 00:48:37,412
An' ain't been home for three days.

669
00:48:37,495 --> 00:48:38,371
Go on.

670
00:48:38,454 --> 00:48:40,665
And this mornin' I gets a message from 'er.

671
00:48:40,748 --> 00:48:42,959
She wants her things sent over...

672
00:48:43,209 --> 00:48:46,129
...to 27A Wimpole Street...

673
00:48:46,462 --> 00:48:48,548
...care of Professor Higgins.

674
00:48:49,966 --> 00:48:51,968
An' what things does she want?

675
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:56,597
Her birdcage and her Chinese fan.

676
00:48:58,933 --> 00:49:00,226
But she says:

677
00:49:00,727 --> 00:49:04,021
'"Never mind about sending any clothes.'"

678
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:10,403
I knew she had a career in front of 'er.

679
00:49:10,653 --> 00:49:13,114
We're in for a booze-up.

680
00:49:13,197 --> 00:49:16,159
The sun is shining on Alfred P. Doolittle.

681
00:49:16,826 --> 00:49:20,204
'"A man was made
to 'elp support his children

682
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:23,791

00:50:29,982 --> 00:50:33,069
'"With a little bit o' bloomin' luck! '"

701
00:50:49,335 --> 00:50:50,586
The mail, sir.

702
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,589
Pay the bills and say no to the invitations.

703
00:51:38,843 --> 00:51:41,387
You simply cannot go on
working the girl this way.

704
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:43,764
Making her say her alphabet
over and over...

705
00:51:43,848 --> 00:51:46,600
...from sunup to sundown,
even during meals.

706
00:51:46,767 --> 00:51:49,353
You'll exhaust yourself. When will it stop?

707
00:51:49,437 --> 00:51:53,024
When she does it properly, of course.
Is that all, Mrs. Pearce?

708
00:51:53,107 --> 00:51:56,610
There's another letter from the
American millionaire, Ezra D. Wallingford.

709
00:51:56,694 --> 00:51:58,904
He still wants you
for his Moral Reform League.

710
00:51:58,988 --> 00:52:00,072
Throw it away.

711
00:52:00,156 --> 00:52:03,659
It's the third letter he's written you.
You should at least answer it.

712
00:52:03,743 --> 00:52:07,663
All right, leave it on the desk, Mrs. Pearce.
I'll try and get to it.

713
00:52:09,832 --> 00:52:13,878
If you please, sir. There's a dustman
downstairs, Alfred P. Doolittle...

714
00:52:14,003 --> 00:52:17,006
...who wants to see you.
He says you have his daughter here.

715
00:52:17,089 --> 00:52:18,340
I say!

716
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:21,510
Well, send the blackguard up.

717
00:52:21,635 --> 00:52:23,596
He may not be a blackguard, Higgins.

718
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:26,348
Nonsense. Of course
he's a blackguard, Pickering.

719
00:52:26,432 --> 00:52:28,809
I'm afraid we'll have some trouble
with him.

720
00:52:28,893 --> 00:52:33,397
No, I think not. Any trouble to be had,
he'll have it with me. Not I with him.

721
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:38,068
Doolittle, sir.

722
00:52:44,492 --> 00:52:46,577
-Professor Higgins?
-Here!

723
00:52:47,745 --> 00:52:48,788
Where?

724
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:51,207
Good morning, Governor.

725
00:52:51,624 --> 00:52:54,668
I come about a very serious matter,
Governor.

726
00:52:58,172 --> 00:53:00,216
Brought up in Houndslow.

727
00:53:00,883 --> 00:53:02,843
Mother Welsh, I should think.

728
00:53:03,844 --> 00:53:05,429
What is it you want, Doolittle?

729
00:53:05,513 --> 00:53:08,057
I want my daughter, that's what I want.
See?

730
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:10,643
Of course you do.
You're her father, aren't you?

731
00:53:10,726 --> 00:53:13,354
I'm glad to see you have a spark
of family feeling left.

732
00:53:13,437 --> 00:53:16,065
She's in there. Yes, take her away at once.

733
00:53:16,232 --> 00:53:17,274
What?

734
00:53:17,816 --> 00:53:21,779
Take her away. Do you think I am going
to keep your daughter for you?

735
00:53:21,904 --> 00:53:24,657
Now, is this reasonable, Governor?

736
00:53:24,823 --> 00:53:27,868
Is it fairity to take advantage
of a man like that?

737
00:53:28,035 --> 00:53:31,288
The girl belongs to me. You got 'er.
Where do I come in?

738
00:53:31,747 --> 00:53:35,417
How dare you come here
and attempt to blackmail me!

739
00:53:36,001 --> 00:53:37,962
You sent her here on purpose!

740
00:53:38,087 --> 00:53:41,382
Don't take a man up like that, Governor.

741
00:53:41,549 --> 00:53:43,717
The police shall take you up.
This is a plan...

742
00:53:43,801 --> 00:53:46,178
...a plot to extort money by threats.

743
00:53:46,262 --> 00:53:48,222
I shall telephone the police.

744
00:53:48,347 --> 00:53:51,350
Have I asked you for a brass farthin'?

745
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:55,437
I leave it to this gentleman 'ere.
Have I said a word about money?

746
00:53:55,521 --> 00:53:57,690
Well, what else did you come for?

747
00:53:59,567 --> 00:54:01,569
What would a bloke come for?

748
00:54:01,944 --> 00:54:03,862
Be 'uman, Governor.

749
00:54:08,951 --> 00:54:11,912
Alfred, you sent her here on purpose.

750
00:54:12,037 --> 00:54:13,706
So help me, Governor, I never did.

751
00:54:13,789 --> 00:54:15,207
How did you know she was here?

752
00:54:15,291 --> 00:54:18,168
I'd tell you, Governor,
if you'd let me get a word in.

753
00:54:18,252 --> 00:54:21,130
I'm willing to tell ya.
I'm wanting to tell ya.

754
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:23,173
I'm waiting to tell ya!

755
00:54:24,883 --> 00:54:28,929
You know, Pickering, this chap's got
a certain natural gift of rhetoric.

756
00:54:29,138 --> 00:54:32,057
Observe the rhythm
of his native woodnotes wild.

757
00:54:32,308 --> 00:54:36,270
'"l'm willing to tell you. I'm wanting
to tell you. I'm waiting to tell you.'"

758
00:54:36,353 --> 00:54:38,522
That's the Welsh strain in 'im.

759
00:54:38,772 --> 00:54:41,400
How did you know Eliza was here
if you didn't send 'er?

760
00:54:41,483 --> 00:54:44,987
Well, she sent back for her luggage
and I got to 'ear about it.

761
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:47,781
She said she didn't want no clothes.

762
00:54:48,407 --> 00:54:53,078
What was I to think from that, Governor?
I ask you, as a parent, what was I to think?

763
00:54:53,537 --> 00:54:57,291
So you came here to rescue her
from worse than death, eh?

764
00:54:57,624 --> 00:55:00,127
-Yes, sir, Governor. That's right.
-Yes.

765
00:55:00,502 --> 00:55:01,920
Mrs. Pearce!

766
00:55:03,338 --> 00:55:06,800
Eliza's father has come to take her away.
Give her to him, will you?

767
00:55:06,884 --> 00:55:10,304
Now wait a minute, Governor.
Wait a minute.

768
00:55:11,263 --> 00:55:13,932
You and me is men o' the world, ain't we?

769
00:55:14,433 --> 00:55:18,520
Men of the world, are we?
Perhaps you'd better go, Mrs. Pearce.

770
00:55:18,604 --> 00:55:20,314
I think so indeed, sir!

771
00:55:20,731 --> 00:55:22,024
Here, Governor.

772
00:55:22,441 --> 00:55:25,360
I've took a sort of a fancy to you and...

773
00:55:28,697 --> 00:55:32,076
...if you want the girl, I ain't so set
on 'avin' her home again...

774
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:35,079
...but what I might be open to
is an arrangement.

775
00:55:35,496 --> 00:55:37,915
All I ask is my rights as a father.

776
00:55:37,998 --> 00:55:41,668
You're the last man alive to expect me
to let her go for nothing.

777
00:55:42,002 --> 00:55:45,255
I can see you're a straight sort, Governor.

778
00:55:45,339 --> 00:55:46,381
So...

779
00:55:46,632 --> 00:55:50,427
...what's a five pound note to you?
An' what's Eliza to me?

780
00:55:51,053 --> 00:55:52,763
I think you should know, Doolittle...

781
00:55:52,846 --> 00:55:56,016
...that Mr. Higgins' intentions
are entirely honorable.

782
00:55:56,391 --> 00:56:00,229
Of course they are, Governor.
If I thought they wasn't, I'd ask 50.

783
00:56:00,729 --> 00:56:03,565
You mean, you'd sell your daughter
for 50 pounds?

784
00:56:03,649 --> 00:56:05,400
Have you no morals, man?

785
00:56:08,403 --> 00:56:12,491
No, I can't afford 'em, Governor. Neither
could you if you was as poor as me.

786
00:56:12,574 --> 00:56:14,785
Not that I mean any 'arm, but...

787
00:56:14,868 --> 00:56:18,372
...if Eliza is gonna have a bit out o' this,
why not me, too?

788
00:56:19,665 --> 00:56:20,749
Why not?

789
00:56:23,669 --> 00:56:26,171
Look at it my way. What am l?

790
00:56:27,172 --> 00:56:31,260
I ask ya, what am l? I'm one
o' the undeserving poor, that's what I am.

791
00:56:31,343 --> 00:56:33,387
Think what that means to a man.

792
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:37,182
It means he's up against
middle-class morality for all the time.

793
00:56:37,766 --> 00:56:41,728
If there's anything goin' an' I ask
for a bit of it, it's always the same story:

794
00:56:41,812 --> 00:56:44,439
'"You're undeservin', so you can't have it.'"

795
00:56:44,606 --> 00:56:48,610
But my needs is as great as the most
deservin' widows that ever got money...

796
00:56:48,694 --> 00:56:53,198
...out of six different charities in one week
for the death o' the same 'usband.

797
00:56:53,282 --> 00:56:56,785
I don't need less than a deservin' man,
I need more.

798
00:56:57,244 --> 00:57:00,247
I don't eat less 'earty than he does
and I drink...

799
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:02,291
...a lot more.

800
00:57:02,583 --> 00:57:04,585
I'm playin' straight with you.

801
00:57:04,668 --> 00:57:08,380
I ain't pretendin' to be deservin'.
No, I'm undeservin'...

802
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,926
...and I mean to go on bein' undeservin'.
I like it an' that's the truth.

803
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:16,597
But will you take advantage
of a man's nature...

804
00:57:16,847 --> 00:57:20,309
...do him out of the price of
his own daughter, what he's brought up...

805
00:57:20,392 --> 00:57:23,103
...fed and clothed
by the sweat of his brow...

806
00:57:23,812 --> 00:57:28,483
...till she's growed big enough
to be interestin' to you two gentlemen?

807
00:57:30,402 --> 00:57:33,739
Is five pounds unreasonable,
I put it to you?

808
00:57:34,114 --> 00:57:35,741
And I leave it to you.

809
00:57:38,577 --> 00:57:42,164
You know, Pickering, if we took this man
in hand for three months...

810
00:57:42,247 --> 00:57:46,668
...he could choose between a seat in
the Cabinet and a popular pulpit in Wales.

811
00:57:47,085 --> 00:57:50,839
-We'd better give 'im a fiver.
-He'll make bad use of it, I'm afraid.

812
00:57:50,922 --> 00:57:52,966
Not me, Governor, so 'elp me I won't.

813
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:55,552
Just one good spree
for meself an' the missus...

814
00:57:55,635 --> 00:57:58,722
...givin' pleasure to ourselves
and employment to others.

815
00:57:58,805 --> 00:58:01,683
An' satisfaction to you to know
it ain't been throwed away.

816
00:58:01,767 --> 00:58:03,435
You couldn't spend it better.

817
00:58:03,518 --> 00:58:06,271
This is irresistible. Let's give 'im ten.

818
00:58:06,646 --> 00:58:08,857
The missus wouldn't have the 'eart
to spend ten.

819
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:10,650
Ten pounds is a lot o' money.

820
00:58:10,734 --> 00:58:14,279
Makes a man feel prudent-like,
and then goodbye to 'appiness.

821
00:58:14,696 --> 00:58:18,742
No, you just give me what I ask, Governor.
Not a penny less, not a penny more.

822
00:58:18,825 --> 00:58:22,162
I rather draw the line at encouraging
this sort of immorality.

823
00:58:22,245 --> 00:58:24,331
Why don't you marry that missus of yours?

824
00:58:24,414 --> 00:58:27,834
After all, marriage isn't so frightening.
You married Eliza's mother.

825
00:58:27,918 --> 00:58:29,544
Who told you that, Governor?

826
00:58:29,628 --> 00:58:32,464
Well, nobody told me.
I concluded, naturally....

827
00:58:36,384 --> 00:58:39,930
If we listen to this man for another minute
we'll have no convictions left.

828
00:58:40,013 --> 00:58:42,849
-Five pounds, I think you said.
-Thank you, Governor.

829
00:58:42,933 --> 00:58:44,309
Are you sure you won't have ten?

830
00:58:44,392 --> 00:58:46,686
No. No, perhaps another time.

831
00:58:48,647 --> 00:58:49,898
I beg your pardon, miss.

832
00:58:49,981 --> 00:58:52,734
I won't say those ruddy vowels
one more time.

833
00:58:52,818 --> 00:58:54,486
Blimey, it's Eliza.

834
00:58:54,778 --> 00:58:57,364
I never thought she'd clean up
so good-looking.

835
00:58:57,447 --> 00:58:59,449
She does me credit, don't she?

836
00:58:59,533 --> 00:59:02,077
What are you doin' here?

837
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:06,623
Now, you hold your tongue and don't
you give these gentlemen none o' your lip.

838
00:59:07,165 --> 00:59:10,502
If you have any trouble with 'er,
give 'er a few licks o' the strap.

839
00:59:10,585 --> 00:59:12,879
That's the way to improve 'er mind.

840
00:59:13,171 --> 00:59:15,882
Well, good morning, gentlemen.
Cheerio, Eliza.

841
00:59:19,553 --> 00:59:23,265
There's a man for you.
A philosophical genius of the first water.

842
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:27,102
Write to Mr. Ezra Wallingford
and tell him...

843
00:59:27,185 --> 00:59:30,522
...if he wants a lecturer, to get in touch
with Mr. Doolittle...

844
00:59:30,605 --> 00:59:34,401
...a common dustman, one of
the most original moralists in England.

845
00:59:34,693 --> 00:59:36,486
What did he come for?

846
00:59:36,736 --> 00:59:37,779
Say your vowels.

847
00:59:37,863 --> 00:59:39,906
I know me vowels.
I knew 'em before I come.

848
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:41,283
If you know them, say them.

849
00:59:41,366 --> 00:59:44,452
Ahyee, e, iyee, ow, you.

850
00:59:45,453 --> 00:59:47,706
A, E, l, O, U.

851
00:59:48,164 --> 00:59:51,084
That's what I said. Ahyee, e, iyee, ow, you.

852
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:54,004
That's what I've said for three days
an' I won't no more.

853
00:59:54,087 --> 00:59:57,215
I know it's difficult, Miss Doolittle,
but try to understand.

854
00:59:57,299 --> 01:00:00,510
There's no use explaining.
As a military man you should know that.

855
01:00:00,594 --> 01:00:02,137
Drilling is what she needs.

856
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:04,639
Leave her alone or she'll turn to you
for sympathy.

857
01:00:04,723 --> 01:00:07,767
Very well, if you insist,
but have a little patience with her.

858
01:00:07,851 --> 01:00:09,060
Of course.

859
01:00:09,686 --> 01:00:11,062
Say '"A.'"

860
01:00:11,229 --> 01:00:13,398
You ain't got no 'eart, you ain't.

861
01:00:20,905 --> 01:00:24,951
I promise you, you'll say your vowels
correctly before this day is out...

862
01:00:25,243 --> 01:00:29,581
...or there'll be no lunch,
no dinner, and no chocolates.

863
01:00:41,051 --> 01:00:44,554
'"Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins

Didn't I saiy that?

900
01:04:17,141 --> 01:04:20,686
No, Eliza, you didn't '"saiy'" that.
You didn't even '"say'" that.

901
01:04:21,062 --> 01:04:24,399
Every night before you go to bed,
where you used to say your prayers...

902
01:04:24,482 --> 01:04:25,691

Fifty times.

905
01:04:30,947 --> 01:04:35,118
You'll get much further with the Lord
if you learn not to offend His ears.

906
01:04:35,868 --> 01:04:37,370
Now for your '"H's.'"

907
01:04:38,579 --> 01:04:40,540
Pickering, this is going to be ghastly.

908
01:04:40,623 --> 01:04:42,834
Control yourself, Higgins.
Give the girl a chance.

909
01:04:42,917 --> 01:04:45,878
I suppose you can't expect her
to get it right the first time.

910
01:04:45,962 --> 01:04:48,214
Come here, Eliza, and watch closely.

911
01:04:52,301 --> 01:04:54,011
Now, you see that flame?

912
01:04:54,303 --> 01:04:57,807
Every time you pronounce the letter '"H'"
correctly the flame will waver...

913
01:04:57,890 --> 01:05:01,185
...and every time you drop your '"H'"
the flame will remain stationary.

914
01:05:01,269 --> 01:05:02,979
That's how to know
you've done it correctly.

915
01:05:03,062 --> 01:05:04,939
In time, your ear will hear the difference.

916
01:05:05,022 --> 01:05:08,693
You'll see it better in the mirror.
Now listen carefully.

917
01:05:09,402 --> 01:05:12,321
'"ln Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire...

918
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:15,783
'"...hurricanes hardly ever happen.'"

919
01:05:16,951 --> 01:05:19,245
Now you repeat that after me.

920
01:05:19,954 --> 01:05:23,499
'"ln Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire,

921
01:05:23,583 --> 01:05:28,462
'"ln 'artford, 'ereford and 'ampshire

922
01:05:28,588 --> 01:05:30,298
Oh, no, no!

923
01:05:30,423 --> 01:05:32,216
Have you no ear at all?

924
01:05:32,341 --> 01:05:34,510
-Should I do it over?
-No, please.

925
01:05:35,219 --> 01:05:37,847
Start from the very beginning.
Just do this.

926
01:05:47,106 --> 01:05:48,774
Go on, go on.

927
01:05:52,653 --> 01:05:54,906
Does the same thing hold true in lndia?

928
01:05:54,989 --> 01:05:58,075
Have they the peculiar habit
of not only dropping a letter...

929
01:05:58,159 --> 01:06:02,204
...but using it where it doesn't belong,
like '"hever'" instead of '"ever'"?

930
01:06:25,561 --> 01:06:26,687
The girl, Higgins!

931
01:06:26,771 --> 01:06:27,980
Go on. Go on.

932
01:06:29,941 --> 01:06:32,777
''Poor Professor Higgins

933
01:06:34,195 --> 01:06:37,073
''Poor Professor Higgins

Again, Eliza.

941
01:07:10,189 --> 01:07:13,067
How kind of you to let me come.

942
01:07:14,193 --> 01:07:17,029
How kind of you to let me come.

943
01:07:17,113 --> 01:07:19,657
No. '"Kind of you.'"

944
01:07:19,824 --> 01:07:22,868
How kind of you to let me come.

945
01:07:23,411 --> 01:07:26,414
How kind of you to let me come.

946
01:07:26,497 --> 01:07:28,833
Kind of you. It's like '"cup of tea.'"

947
01:07:28,916 --> 01:07:31,752
Kind of you. Cup of tea. Say, '"cup of tea.'"

948
01:07:31,961 --> 01:07:33,003
Cuppatea.

949
01:07:33,087 --> 01:07:35,381
No. '"A cup of tea.'"

950
01:07:36,215 --> 01:07:39,593
It's awfully good cake.
I wonder where Mrs. Pearce gets it.

951
01:07:39,969 --> 01:07:44,598
First rate. And those strawberry tarts
are delicious. Did you try the pline cake?

952
01:07:50,271 --> 01:07:51,564
Try it again.

953
01:07:51,689 --> 01:07:53,607
-Did you try the--
-Pickering!

954
01:07:55,192 --> 01:07:56,485
Again, Eliza.

955
01:07:56,610 --> 01:07:57,862
Cuppatea.

956
01:07:57,945 --> 01:07:58,988
Oh, no.

957
01:07:59,572 --> 01:08:01,073
Can't you hear the difference?

958
01:08:01,157 --> 01:08:05,911
Look, put your tongue forward until
it squeezes on the top of your lower teeth.

959
01:08:06,454 --> 01:08:08,622
And then say '"cup.'"

960
01:08:10,124 --> 01:08:11,375
Then say '"of.'"

961
01:08:11,792 --> 01:08:14,545
Then say '"cup, cup, cup, cup, of, of, of, of.'"

962
01:08:18,299 --> 01:08:20,843
By Jove, Higgins, that was a glorious tea.

963
01:08:20,968 --> 01:08:24,221
You finish the last strawberry tart.
I couldn't eat another thing.

964
01:08:24,305 --> 01:08:26,223
-I couldn't touch it.
-Shame to waste it.

965
01:08:26,307 --> 01:08:31,103
Oh, it won't be wasted. I know somebody
who's immensely fond of strawberry tarts.

966
01:08:41,322 --> 01:08:44,033
''Poor Professor Higgins

967
01:08:45,534 --> 01:08:48,287

Four.

Five.

Six marbles.

977
01:09:26,033 --> 01:09:29,453
...every word just as if the marbles

01:09:36,085 --> 01:09:37,920
Each word, clear as a bell.

I can't!

984
01:09:45,886 --> 01:09:47,054
I can't!

985
01:09:47,179 --> 01:09:50,182
I say, Higgins, are those pebbles
really necessary?

986
01:09:50,432 --> 01:09:54,812
If they were necessary for Demosthenes
they are necessary for Eliza Doolittle.

987
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:56,355
Go on, Eliza.

988
01:09:56,772 --> 01:10:00,609
'"With the blackest moss the flower pots...

989
01:10:00,985 --> 01:10:04,071
'"...were thickly crusted one and--'"

990
01:10:04,446 --> 01:10:07,199
I can't understand a word, not a word.

991
01:10:07,366 --> 01:10:10,077
'"With blackest moss, the flower pots...

992
01:10:10,452 --> 01:10:13,122
'"...were thickly crusted, one and all.'"

993
01:10:13,414 --> 01:10:16,041
Perhaps the poem is
a little too difficult for the girl.

994
01:10:16,125 --> 01:10:19,628
Why don't you try something simpler,
like The Owl and the Pussycat?

995
01:10:19,712 --> 01:10:21,839
Yes, that's a charming one.

996
01:10:22,047 --> 01:10:25,050
Pickering, I can't hear a word
the girl is saying!

997
01:10:29,221 --> 01:10:30,681
What's the matter?

998
01:10:31,682 --> 01:10:32,975
I swallowed one.

999
01:10:33,058 --> 01:10:37,104
It doesn't matter. I've got plenty more.
Open your mouth. One, two....

1000
01:10:39,565 --> 01:10:42,234
''Quit, Professor Higgins

1001
01:10:43,485 --> 01:10:46,238

1010
01:11:23,609 --> 01:11:25,194
I can't!

1011
01:11:25,611 --> 01:11:27,362
I'm so tired!

1012
01:11:27,446 --> 01:11:29,948
I'm so tired.

1013
01:11:30,324 --> 01:11:33,869
For God's sake, Higgins,
it must be 3:00 in the morning.

1014
01:11:33,952 --> 01:11:35,329
Do be reasonable.

1015
01:11:36,121 --> 01:11:38,290
I am always reasonable.

1016
01:11:40,292 --> 01:11:44,880
Eliza, if I can go on
with a blistering headache, you can.

1017
01:11:46,173 --> 01:11:48,050
I got a 'eadache, too.

1018
01:11:51,553 --> 01:11:54,723
I know your head aches.
I know you're tired.

1019
01:11:55,307 --> 01:11:58,977
I know your nerves are as raw
as meat in a butcher's window.

1020
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:04,566
But think what you're trying to accomplish.

1021
01:12:05,525 --> 01:12:08,195
Just think what you're dealing with.

1022
01:12:09,821 --> 01:12:13,033
The majesty and grandeur
of the English language....

1023
01:12:13,116 --> 01:12:15,702
It's the greatest possession we have.

1024
01:12:16,495 --> 01:12:19,873
The noblest thoughts that ever flowed
through the hearts of men...

1025
01:12:19,957 --> 01:12:23,710
...are contained in its extraordinary,
imaginative...

1026
01:12:24,086 --> 01:12:26,421
...and musical mixtures of sounds.

1027
01:12:27,923 --> 01:12:31,260
And that's what you've set yourself
out to conquer, Eliza.

1028
01:12:32,970 --> 01:12:35,931
And conquer it you will.

1029
01:13:01,873 --> 01:13:03,625
Now try it again.

1030
01:13:07,212 --> 01:13:10,507
'"The rain in Spain...

1031
01:13:11,216 --> 01:13:15,137

'"The rain in Spain

1037
01:13:47,085 --> 01:13:50,046

1054
01:15:46,454 --> 01:15:50,959
We're making fine progress, Pickering.
I think the time has come to try her out.

1055
01:15:51,543 --> 01:15:53,253
Are you feeling all right, Mr. Higgins?

1056
01:15:53,336 --> 01:15:54,921
Yes, I'm feeling fine. How are you?

1057
01:15:55,005 --> 01:15:56,381
-Very well, thank you.
-Good.

1058
01:15:56,464 --> 01:15:59,175
Let's test her in public
and see how she fares.

1059
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:02,971
Mr. Higgins, I was awakened
by a dreadful pounding.

1060
01:16:03,054 --> 01:16:04,639
Do you know what it might have been?

1061
01:16:04,723 --> 01:16:07,475
I didn't hear any pounding.
Did you, Pickering?

1062
01:16:08,018 --> 01:16:10,437
If this goes on, you'd better see a doctor.

1063
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:13,356
-I know. We'll take her to the races.
-The races?

1064
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,191
My mother's box at Ascot.

1065
01:16:15,358 --> 01:16:18,903
-You'll consult your mother first, of course.
-Yes, of course.

1066
01:16:21,031 --> 01:16:24,284
No, I think we'd better surprise her.
Now let's go to bed.

1067
01:16:24,367 --> 01:16:27,245
First thing in the morning,
we'll go and buy her a dress.

1068
01:16:27,328 --> 01:16:28,955
Now get on with your work, Eliza.

1069
01:16:29,039 --> 01:16:31,082
But, Mr. Higgins, it's early in the morning.

1070
01:16:31,166 --> 01:16:34,169
What better time to work
than early in the morning?

1071
01:16:34,502 --> 01:16:36,463
Where does one buy a lady's gown?

1072
01:16:36,546 --> 01:16:37,839
Whitely's, of course.

1073
01:16:37,922 --> 01:16:39,007
How do you know that?

1074
01:16:39,090 --> 01:16:40,508
Common knowledge.

1075
01:16:40,717 --> 01:16:42,510
Let's not buy her anything too flowery.

1076
01:16:42,594 --> 01:16:46,890
I despise those gowns with weeds here
and weeds there.

1077
01:16:47,307 --> 01:16:49,809
We'll buy something simple and modest...

1078
01:16:49,893 --> 01:16:52,187
...and elegant. That's what's called for.

1079
01:16:52,270 --> 01:16:54,439
Perhaps with a bow.

1080
01:16:55,857 --> 01:16:57,567
Yes. That's just right.

1081
01:17:00,528 --> 01:17:04,282
You've all been working too hard.
I think the strain is beginning to show.

1082
01:17:04,365 --> 01:17:06,659
Eliza, I don't care what Mr. Higgins says.

1083
01:17:06,743 --> 01:17:09,329
You must put down your books
and go to bed.

1084
01:17:09,412 --> 01:17:12,373
'"Bed! Bed! I couldn't go to bed

Hello, Mother.

1153
01:24:52,625 --> 01:24:53,751
How nice you look.

1154
01:24:53,834 --> 01:24:57,212
What are you doing here? You promised
never to come to Ascot. Go home.

1155
01:24:57,296 --> 01:24:58,839
I can't. I'm here on business.

1156
01:24:58,922 --> 01:25:01,759
You must. I'm quite serious.
You'll offend all my friends.

1157
01:25:01,842 --> 01:25:04,303
The moment they meet you
I never see them again.

1158
01:25:04,386 --> 01:25:06,180
Besides, you aren't dressed for Ascot.

1159
01:25:06,263 --> 01:25:08,807
I changed my shirt.
Mother, I've got a job for you.

1160
01:25:08,891 --> 01:25:11,393
A phonetics job. I've picked up a girl.

1161
01:25:12,019 --> 01:25:14,313
Not a love affair. She's a flower girl.

1162
01:25:14,396 --> 01:25:17,858
I'm taking her to the annual Embassy Ball
but I wanted to try her out first.

1163
01:25:17,941 --> 01:25:21,028
-I beg your pardon?
-Well, you know the Embassy Ball.

1164
01:25:21,570 --> 01:25:24,448
So I invited her to your box today,
do you understand?

1165
01:25:24,531 --> 01:25:25,991
Common flower girl?

1166
01:25:26,158 --> 01:25:28,118
I taught her how to speak properly.

1167
01:25:28,202 --> 01:25:30,496
She has strict instructions
as to her behavior.

1168
01:25:30,579 --> 01:25:33,999
She's to keep to two subjects:
the weather and everybody's health.

1169
01:25:34,083 --> 01:25:37,252
'"Fine day! '" and '"How do you do?'"
Not let herself go on.

1170
01:25:37,336 --> 01:25:39,380
Help her along. You'll be quite safe.

1171
01:25:39,463 --> 01:25:41,673
Safe? To talk about one's health
in the middle of a race?

1172
01:25:41,757 --> 01:25:43,801
She's got to talk about something.

1173
01:25:43,884 --> 01:25:45,094
Where is the girl now?

1174
01:25:45,177 --> 01:25:48,472
She's being pinned. Some of the clothes
we bought her didn't fit.

1175
01:25:48,555 --> 01:25:51,475
I told Pickering we should have
taken her with us.

1176
01:25:54,186 --> 01:25:57,356
-Mrs. Eynsford-Hill.
-Good afternoon, Mrs. Higgins.

1177
01:25:58,399 --> 01:26:00,067
You know my son, Henry.

1178
01:26:00,150 --> 01:26:01,402
How do you do?

1179
01:26:01,985 --> 01:26:04,363
-I've seen you somewhere before.
-I don't know.

1180
01:26:04,446 --> 01:26:06,949
It doesn't matter. You better sit down.

1181
01:26:10,494 --> 01:26:12,412
Where the devil can they be?

1182
01:26:47,364 --> 01:26:49,575
Colonel Pickering,
you're just in time for tea.

1183
01:26:49,658 --> 01:26:52,953
Thank you, Mrs. Higgins.
May I introduce Miss Eliza Doolittle?

1184
01:26:53,036 --> 01:26:54,371
My dear Miss Doolittle.

1185
01:26:54,454 --> 01:26:57,165
How kind of you to let me come.

1186
01:26:57,249 --> 01:26:58,750
Delighted, my dear.

1187
01:26:59,710 --> 01:27:01,712
-Lady Boxington.
-How do you do?

1188
01:27:03,797 --> 01:27:05,674
-Lord Boxington.
-How do you do?

1189
01:27:05,757 --> 01:27:06,675
How do you do?

1190
01:27:06,758 --> 01:27:09,678
-Mrs. Eynsford-Hill, Miss Doolittle.
-How do you do?

1191
01:27:09,761 --> 01:27:11,263
How do you do?

1192
01:27:11,513 --> 01:27:13,390
And Freddy Eynsford-Hill.

1193
01:27:14,558 --> 01:27:16,101
How do you do?

1194
01:27:18,437 --> 01:27:20,022
How do you do?

1195
01:27:20,772 --> 01:27:22,065
Miss Doolittle.

1196
01:27:22,316 --> 01:27:25,485
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins.

1197
01:27:34,703 --> 01:27:37,414
The first race was very exciting,
Miss Doolittle.

1198
01:27:37,497 --> 01:27:39,750
I'm so sorry that you missed it.

1199
01:27:39,958 --> 01:27:41,793
Will it rain, do you think?

1200
01:27:42,085 --> 01:27:46,173
'"The rain in Spain stays mainly
in the plain.'"

1201
01:27:51,303 --> 01:27:55,807
'"But in Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire,
hurricanes hardly ever happen.'"

1202
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:58,644
How awfully funny.

1203
01:27:58,810 --> 01:28:02,272
What is wrong with that, young man?
I bet I got it right.

1204
01:28:02,564 --> 01:28:03,649
Smashing.

1205
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:06,401
Has it suddenly turned chilly?

1206
01:28:06,902 --> 01:28:10,280
I do hope we won't have
any unseasonable cold spells.

1207
01:28:10,530 --> 01:28:12,532
They bring on so much influenza.

1208
01:28:12,616 --> 01:28:15,369
And the whole of our family
is susceptible to it.

1209
01:28:15,452 --> 01:28:19,790
My aunt died of influenza, so they said.

1210
01:28:20,332 --> 01:28:24,127
But it's my belief they done
the old woman in.

1211
01:28:25,337 --> 01:28:26,630
Done her in?

1212
01:28:27,255 --> 01:28:28,965
Yes, Lord love you.

1213
01:28:29,216 --> 01:28:31,468
Why should she die of influenza...

1214
01:28:31,718 --> 01:28:35,514
...when she'd come through diphtheria
right enough the year before.

1215
01:28:35,764 --> 01:28:37,974
Fairly blue with it she was.

1216
01:28:38,642 --> 01:28:40,519
They all thought she was dead.

1217
01:28:40,602 --> 01:28:44,731
But my father, he kept ladling gin
down her throat.

1218
01:28:49,694 --> 01:28:54,074
Then she come to so sudden
she bit the bowl off the spoon.

1219
01:28:55,367 --> 01:28:56,827
Dear me!

1220
01:28:57,994 --> 01:29:01,331
Now what call would a woman
with that strength in her...

1221
01:29:01,415 --> 01:29:03,333
...have to die of influenza?

1222
01:29:04,042 --> 01:29:08,338
And what become of her new straw hat
that should have come to me?

1223
01:29:10,924 --> 01:29:13,260
Somebody pinched it.

1224
01:29:14,511 --> 01:29:16,304
And what I say is:

1225
01:29:16,513 --> 01:29:19,474
Them 'as pinched it, done her in.

1226
01:29:20,725 --> 01:29:23,270
Done her in? '"Done her in,'" did you say?

1227
01:29:23,979 --> 01:29:25,647
Whatever does it mean?

1228
01:29:25,772 --> 01:29:30,360
That's the new small talk.
'"To do somebody in'" means to kill them.

1229
01:29:31,027 --> 01:29:34,114
But you surely don't believe
your aunt was killed?

1230
01:29:34,698 --> 01:29:35,991
Do I not?

1231
01:29:36,116 --> 01:29:41,121
Them she lived with would have killed her
for a hatpin, let alone a hat.

1232
01:29:41,538 --> 01:29:43,957
But it can't have been right
for your father...

1233
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:46,877
...to pour spirits down her throat like that.

1234
01:29:47,252 --> 01:29:48,920
It might have killed her.

1235
01:29:49,004 --> 01:29:52,799
Not her. Gin was mother's milk to her.

1236
01:29:53,175 --> 01:29:58,305
Besides, he poured so much down
his own throat he knew the good of it.

1237
01:29:59,055 --> 01:30:00,807
Do you mean that he drank?

1238
01:30:00,891 --> 01:30:03,727
Drank? My word. Something chronic.

1239
01:30:07,564 --> 01:30:10,650
Here, what are you sniggering at?

1240
01:30:11,318 --> 01:30:14,446
The new small talk.
You do it so awfully well.

1241
01:30:14,654 --> 01:30:18,325
Well, if I was doing it proper,
what was you sniggering at?

1242
01:30:19,284 --> 01:30:21,578
Have I said anything I oughtn't?

1243
01:30:23,496 --> 01:30:25,081
Not at all, my dear.

1244
01:30:25,290 --> 01:30:27,250
Well, that's a mercy anyhow.

1245
01:30:30,253 --> 01:30:33,798
I don't know if there's time
before the next race to place a bet...

1246
01:30:33,882 --> 01:30:35,717
...but come, my dear.

1247
01:30:36,092 --> 01:30:39,763
I have a bet on number seven.
I should be so happy if you would take it.

1248
01:30:39,846 --> 01:30:41,973
You'll enjoy the race ever so much more.

1249
01:30:42,057 --> 01:30:43,683
That's very kind of you.

1250
01:30:43,767 --> 01:30:44,893
His name is Dover.

1251
01:30:44,976 --> 01:30:46,436
Come along.

1252
01:30:49,898 --> 01:30:51,816
'"There they are again

1253
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:53,526
'"Lining up to run

1254
01:30:53,985 --> 01:30:55,695
'"Now they're holding steady

1255
01:30:55,779 --> 01:30:58,073
'"They are ready for it. Look!

1256
01:30:59,115 --> 01:31:01,368
'"lt has begun'"

1257
01:31:07,290 --> 01:31:09,084
Come on. Come on, Dover.

1258
01:31:10,043 --> 01:31:11,044
Come on.

1259
01:31:11,336 --> 01:31:12,962
Come on, Dover!

1260
01:31:13,088 --> 01:31:14,130
Come on!

1261
01:31:18,468 --> 01:31:22,639
Come on, Dover!
Move your bloomin' arse!

1262
01:31:29,145 --> 01:31:30,522
Oh, my dear.

1263
01:31:45,495 --> 01:31:49,374
You're not serious, Henry. You don't
expect to take her to the Embassy Ball.

1264
01:31:49,457 --> 01:31:51,000
Don't you think she's ready for it?

1265
01:31:51,084 --> 01:31:53,461
Dear Henry, she's ready for a canal barge.

1266
01:31:53,545 --> 01:31:55,797
Her language may need
a little refining, but--

1267
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:59,509
Really, Henry, if you cannot see
how impossible this whole project is...

1268
01:31:59,592 --> 01:32:01,261
...then you must be potty about her.

1269
01:32:01,344 --> 01:32:03,430
I advise you to give up
and not put yourself...

1270
01:32:03,513 --> 01:32:05,098
...or this poor girl through any more.

1271
01:32:05,181 --> 01:32:07,725
It's the most fascinating venture
I've ever undertaken.

1272
01:32:07,809 --> 01:32:11,271
Pickering and I are at it from morning
till night. It fills our whole lives.

1273
01:32:11,354 --> 01:32:15,233
Teaching Eliza, talking to Eliza,
listening to Eliza, dressing Eliza.

1274
01:32:16,401 --> 01:32:19,946
You're a pretty pair of babies
playing with your live doll.

1275
01:32:20,029 --> 01:32:21,322
Here's the car.

1276
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:43,571
Good evening, sir.

1277
01:33:43,655 --> 01:33:46,324
-Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
-Immediately, sir.

1278
01:33:46,407 --> 01:33:48,493
Good evening, Professor Higgins.

1279
01:34:06,094 --> 01:34:10,306
'"When she mentioned
how her aunt bit off the spoon

1280
01:34:11,057 --> 01:34:14,352
'"She completely done me in

1281
01:34:14,852 --> 01:34:18,231
'"And my heart went on
a journey to the moon

1282
01:34:18,815 --> 01:34:23,444
'"When she told about her father
and the gin

1283
01:34:24,112 --> 01:34:28,116
'"And I never saw a more enchanting farce

1284
01:34:28,825 --> 01:34:33,788
'"Than the moment when she shouted
'Move your bloomin'--''"

1285
01:34:34,497 --> 01:34:36,541
-Yes, sir?
-Is Miss Doolittle in?

1286
01:34:36,624 --> 01:34:38,459
Whom shall I say is calling?

1287
01:34:38,543 --> 01:34:41,838
Freddy Eynsford-Hill.
If she doesn't remember who I am...

1288
01:34:41,963 --> 01:34:44,882
...tell her I'm the chap
who was '"sniggering'" at her.

1289
01:34:44,966 --> 01:34:45,967
Yes, sir.

1290
01:34:46,050 --> 01:34:47,969
And will you give her these?

1291
01:34:48,428 --> 01:34:49,637
Wouldn't you like to come in?

1292
01:34:49,721 --> 01:34:51,848
They're having dinner,
but you may wait in the hall.

1293
01:34:51,931 --> 01:34:55,476
No, thank you. I want to drink in
the street where she lives.

1294
01:35:03,818 --> 01:35:08,781
'"l have often walked
down this street before

1295
01:35:09,615 --> 01:35:14,495
'"But the pavement always stayed
beneath my feet before

1296
01:35:15,246 --> 01:35:20,209
'"All at once am I several stories high

01:35:20,877 --> 01:35:25,506
'"Knowing I'm on the street where you live

01:35:26,799 --> 01:35:31,762

'"Can you hear a lark

'"Does enchantment pour

1301
01:35:43,983 --> 01:35:48,654
'"No, it's just on the street where you live

1302
01:35:50,198 --> 01:35:54,702
'"And, oh, the towering feeling

01:35:55,536 --> 01:36:00,041
'"Just to know somehow you are near

'"Can be here on the street where you live'"

1311
01:36:44,710 --> 01:36:46,629
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

1312
01:36:46,754 --> 01:36:49,882
Miss Doolittle says she doesn't want
to see anyone ever again.

1313
01:36:49,966 --> 01:36:51,676
But why? She was unbelievable.

1314
01:36:51,759 --> 01:36:54,929
So I've been told, sir.
Is there any further message?

1315
01:36:56,097 --> 01:36:57,348
Tell her that I'll wait.

1316
01:36:57,431 --> 01:36:59,850
But it might be days, sir, even weeks.

1317
01:36:59,934 --> 01:37:02,478
But don't you see? I'll be happier here.

1318
01:37:11,404 --> 01:37:16,075
'"People stop and stare,
they don't bother me

1319
01:37:17,410 --> 01:37:22,081

'"Can be here on the street where you live'"

1323
01:37:46,939 --> 01:37:49,567
It really is, Higgins.
It's inhuman to continue.

1324
01:37:49,650 --> 01:37:52,695
Do you realize what you've got to teach
this girl in six weeks?

1325
01:37:52,778 --> 01:37:55,740
You've got to teach her to walk, talk,
address a duke, a lord...

1326
01:37:55,823 --> 01:37:58,534
...a bishop, an ambassador.
It's absolutely impossible.

1327
01:37:58,617 --> 01:38:02,163
Higgins, I'm trying to tell you
that I want to call off the bet.

1328
01:38:02,246 --> 01:38:04,498
I know you're a stubborn man, but so am l.

1329
01:38:04,582 --> 01:38:06,500
This experiment is over.

1330
01:38:06,584 --> 01:38:10,921
And nothing short of an order
from the king could force me to recant.

1331
01:38:12,923 --> 01:38:15,301
You understand, Higgins? It's over.

1332
01:38:17,052 --> 01:38:19,847
Higgins, if there's any mishap
at the Embassy tonight...

1333
01:38:19,930 --> 01:38:22,558
...if Miss Doolittle suffers
any embarrassment...

1334
01:38:22,641 --> 01:38:23,893
...it'll be on your head alone.

1335
01:38:23,976 --> 01:38:25,227
Eliza can do anything.

1336
01:38:25,311 --> 01:38:27,104
Suppose she's discovered?
Remember Ascot.

1337
01:38:27,188 --> 01:38:29,064
Suppose she makes
another ghastly mistake?

1338
01:38:29,148 --> 01:38:31,817
There'll be no horses at the ball, Pickering.

1339
01:38:33,861 --> 01:38:36,155
Think of how agonizing it would be.

1340
01:38:36,238 --> 01:38:38,908
If anything happened tonight,
I don't know what I'd do.

1341
01:38:38,991 --> 01:38:40,576
You could always rejoin your regiment.

1342
01:38:40,659 --> 01:38:42,495
This is no time for flippancy, Higgins.

1343
01:38:42,578 --> 01:38:44,622
The way you've driven her
the last six weeks...

1344
01:38:44,705 --> 01:38:46,790
...has exceeded all bounds
of common decency.

1345
01:38:46,874 --> 01:38:49,877
For God's sake, stop pacing.
Can't you settle somewhere?

1346
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:51,921
Have some port. It'll quieten your nerves.

1347
01:38:52,004 --> 01:38:53,339
I'm not nervous.

1348
01:38:54,965 --> 01:38:56,884
-Where is it?
-On the piano.

1349
01:38:58,427 --> 01:38:59,762
The car's here, sir.

1350
01:38:59,845 --> 01:39:01,514
Good. Tell Miss Doolittle.

1351
01:39:01,597 --> 01:39:05,226
Tell Miss Doolittle indeed.
I'll bet you that damned gown doesn't fit.

1352
01:39:05,309 --> 01:39:07,394
I warned you about these French designers.

1353
01:39:07,478 --> 01:39:10,814
We should've gone to an English shop.
They would've been on our side.

1354
01:39:10,898 --> 01:39:13,234
-Have a glass of port?
-No, thank you.

1355
01:39:19,573 --> 01:39:23,786
Are you so sure this girl will retain
everything you've hammered into her?

1356
01:39:24,370 --> 01:39:26,038
Well, we shall see.

1357
01:39:26,372 --> 01:39:27,915
Suppose she doesn't?

1358
01:39:29,166 --> 01:39:30,709
I lose my bet.

1359
01:39:30,876 --> 01:39:34,547
There's one thing I can't stand about you,
your confounded complacency.

1360
01:39:34,630 --> 01:39:36,674
At a moment like this,
with so much at stake...

1361
01:39:36,757 --> 01:39:40,261
...it's utterly indecent
that you don't need a glass of port.

1362
01:39:41,929 --> 01:39:45,683
And what about the girl? You act
as though she doesn't matter at all.

1363
01:39:45,766 --> 01:39:48,394
Rubbish, Pickering. Of course she matters.

1364
01:39:48,769 --> 01:39:51,188
What do you think I've been doing
all these months?

1365
01:39:51,272 --> 01:39:54,775
What could possibly matter more
than to take a human being...

1366
01:39:54,858 --> 01:39:59,071
...and change her into a different human
being by creating a new speech for her?

1367
01:39:59,154 --> 01:40:02,908
It's filling up the deepest gap
that separates class from class...

1368
01:40:03,075 --> 01:40:04,660
...and soul from soul.

1369
01:40:05,077 --> 01:40:07,746
Oh, she matters immensely.

1370
01:40:29,852 --> 01:40:32,354
Miss Doolittle, you look beautiful.

1371
01:40:33,022 --> 01:40:34,606
Thank you, Colonel Pickering.

1372
01:40:34,690 --> 01:40:36,608
Don't you think so, Higgins?

1373
01:40:39,319 --> 01:40:41,989
Not bad. Not bad at all.

1374
01:43:42,669 --> 01:43:45,130
Maestro! Maestro!

1375
01:43:47,382 --> 01:43:48,550
Don't you remember me?

1376
01:43:48,633 --> 01:43:50,260
No. Who the devil are you?

1377
01:43:50,343 --> 01:43:53,805
I'm your pupil. Your first, your greatest,
your best pupil.

1378
01:43:53,930 --> 01:43:56,433
I'm Zoltan Karpathy, that marvelous boy.

1379
01:43:57,601 --> 01:43:59,561
I made your name famous
throughout Europe.

1380
01:43:59,644 --> 01:44:01,563
You teach me phonetics.
You can't forget me.

1381
01:44:01,646 --> 01:44:03,398
Why don't you have your hair cut?

1382
01:44:03,482 --> 01:44:07,027
I don't have your imposing appearance,
your figure, your brow.

1383
01:44:07,152 --> 01:44:09,196
If I had my hair cut,
nobody would notice me.

1384
01:44:09,279 --> 01:44:11,114
Where did you get these old coins?

1385
01:44:11,198 --> 01:44:13,200
These are decorations for languages.

1386
01:44:13,283 --> 01:44:15,035
The Queen of Transylvania is here.

1387
01:44:15,118 --> 01:44:18,246
I'm indispensable to her
at these official international parties.

1388
01:44:18,330 --> 01:44:21,249
I speak 32 languages.
I know everyone in Europe.

1389
01:44:21,333 --> 01:44:23,418
No imposter can escape my detection.

1390
01:44:23,502 --> 01:44:25,504
Professor Karpathy.

1391
01:44:27,672 --> 01:44:29,216
The Greek ambassador.

1392
01:44:30,008 --> 01:44:31,093
Greek, my foot!

1393
01:44:31,176 --> 01:44:33,970
He pretends not to know English,
but he can't deceive me.

1394
01:44:34,054 --> 01:44:36,473
He's the son of a Yorkshire watchmaker.

1395
01:44:37,182 --> 01:44:40,602
He speaks English so villainously
that he cannot utter a word...

1396
01:44:40,685 --> 01:44:42,938
...without betraying his origin.

1397
01:44:43,021 --> 01:44:46,775
I help him pretend, but make him pay
through the nose. I make them all pay.

1398
01:44:46,858 --> 01:44:50,153
Excuse me, sir, you are wanted upstairs.
Her Excellency asked for you.

1399
01:45:09,881 --> 01:45:11,883
Viscount and Viscountess Saxon.

1400
01:45:15,262 --> 01:45:18,139
Baron and Baroness of Yorkshire.

1401
01:45:19,850 --> 01:45:22,686
Sir Guy and Lady Scot-Auckland.

1402
01:45:42,539 --> 01:45:44,708
The Count and Countess Demereau.

1403
01:45:45,417 --> 01:45:47,919
The Viscount and Viscountess Hillyard.

1404
01:45:48,086 --> 01:45:50,964
Mr. and Mrs. Richard Lanser.

1405
01:45:51,590 --> 01:45:54,217
Lord and Lady Clanders.

1406
01:45:54,884 --> 01:45:57,762
Miss Eliza Doolittle, Colonel Pickering.

1407
01:45:58,096 --> 01:46:01,683
Miss Eliza Doolittle. Colonel Pickering.

1408
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:04,102
Professor Higgins.

1409
01:46:04,603 --> 01:46:06,688
-Your Excellency.
-Miss Doolittle.

1410
01:46:06,771 --> 01:46:08,064
How do you do?

1411
01:46:08,148 --> 01:46:10,442
-Good evening, Colonel.
-Good evening.

1412
01:46:11,860 --> 01:46:15,196
What an enchanting young lady
you have with you this evening.

1413
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:16,698
Well, who is she?

1414
01:46:17,073 --> 01:46:20,785
Oh, a cousin of mine. And Higgins.
Excuse me.

1415
01:46:21,119 --> 01:46:22,454
Professor Higgins.

1416
01:46:22,537 --> 01:46:26,624
Such a faraway look,
as if she's always lived in a garden.

1417
01:46:26,958 --> 01:46:29,127
So she has. A sort of garden.

1418
01:46:57,989 --> 01:47:01,451
Henry must take Eliza home at once.
There's a language expert here.

1419
01:47:01,534 --> 01:47:04,704
-Sort of, you know, '"imposterologist.'"
-I beg you pardon?

1420
01:47:05,455 --> 01:47:07,999
The young lady with Colonel Pickering....

1421
01:47:08,124 --> 01:47:09,709
Find out who she is.

1422
01:47:09,959 --> 01:47:11,211
With pleasure.

1423
01:47:11,669 --> 01:47:14,172
The whole situation is highly explosive.

1424
01:47:19,969 --> 01:47:22,555
Tell me, Zoltan,
some more about the Greek ambassador.

1425
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:26,226
Gladly, but first I would love you
to present me to this glorious creature.

1426
01:47:26,309 --> 01:47:28,520
Does he really come from Yorkshire?

1427
01:47:37,362 --> 01:47:40,198
Her Majesty, the Queen of Transylvania...

1428
01:47:40,490 --> 01:47:43,660
...and His Royal Highness Prince Gregor.

1429
01:48:29,747 --> 01:48:32,250
Charming. Quite charming.

1430
01:48:33,585 --> 01:48:35,378
Miss Doolittle, Madam.

1431
01:50:11,474 --> 01:50:14,519
Miss Doolittle, my son would like
to dance with you.

1432
01:53:21,163 --> 01:53:22,998
Absolutely fantastic.

1433
01:53:26,460 --> 01:53:27,920
A lot of tomfoolery.

1434
01:53:28,003 --> 01:53:30,047
It was an immense achievement.

1435
01:53:30,131 --> 01:53:31,590
Well, Mr. Higgins?

1436
01:53:32,049 --> 01:53:35,177
A triumph, Mrs. Pearce. A total triumph.

1437
01:53:35,469 --> 01:53:38,931
Higgins, you were superb,
absolutely superb.

1438
01:53:39,140 --> 01:53:43,102
Tell us the truth now, weren't you
a little bit nervous once or twice?

1439
01:53:43,227 --> 01:53:44,979
Not during the whole evening?

1440
01:53:45,062 --> 01:53:46,730
Not when I saw we were going to win.

1441
01:53:46,814 --> 01:53:48,816
I felt like a bear in a cage hanging about.

1442
01:53:48,899 --> 01:53:50,568
It was an immense achievement.

1443
01:53:50,651 --> 01:53:53,737
If I hadn't backed myself to do it,
I'd have given up two months ago.

1444
01:53:53,821 --> 01:53:55,156
Absolutely fantastic.

1445
01:53:55,239 --> 01:53:56,782
Yes, a lot of tomfoolery.

1446
01:53:56,866 --> 01:53:58,826
Higgins, I salute you.

1447
01:53:58,909 --> 01:54:01,662
The silly people don't know
their own silly business.

1448
01:54:01,745 --> 01:54:04,748
'"Tonight, old man, you did it
You did it, you did it

1449
01:54:04,915 --> 01:54:07,793

1474

Thank goodness for Zoltan Karpathy.

1475
01:55:34,755 --> 01:55:37,007
If it hadn't been for him
I would've died of boredom.

1476
01:55:37,091 --> 01:55:39,343
Karpathy? That dreadful Hungarian?
Was he there?

1477
01:55:39,426 --> 01:55:42,513
Yes, he was there all right
and up to his old tricks.

'"She is a princess

01:57:43,175 --> 01:57:47,471
'"'And she's Hungarian

1508
01:57:55,479 --> 01:57:59,316
'"Congratulations, Professor Higgins

'"For your glorious victory

'"Congratulations, Professor Higgins

'"You'll be mentioned in history'"

1512
01:58:33,767 --> 01:58:35,978
Well, thank God, that's over.

1513
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:39,231
Now I can go to bed
without dreading tomorrow.

1514
01:58:41,650 --> 01:58:43,986
-Good night, Mr. Higgins.
-Good night, Mrs. Pearce.

1515
01:58:44,069 --> 01:58:47,948
I think I'll turn in, too. Good night.
It's been a great occasion.

1516
01:58:48,031 --> 01:58:49,658
Good night, Pickering.

1517
01:58:50,575 --> 01:58:51,910
Mrs. Pearce?

1518
01:58:52,828 --> 01:58:57,040
Damn, I meant to ask her to give me coffee
in the morning instead of tea.

1519
01:58:57,666 --> 01:59:01,503
Leave a little note for her will you, Eliza.
And put out the lights.

1520
01:59:49,259 --> 01:59:51,845
Must be downstairs. Oh, darn it.

1521
01:59:52,220 --> 01:59:54,055
I'll leave my head behind
one of these days.

1522
01:59:54,139 --> 01:59:56,766
What the devil have I done
with my slippers?

1523
01:59:59,478 --> 02:00:01,188
Here are your slippers!

1524
02:00:06,485 --> 02:00:10,280
Take your slippers and may you never
have a day's luck with them.

1525
02:00:10,989 --> 02:00:12,991
What on earth? What's the matter?

1526
02:00:13,074 --> 02:00:14,743
Is anything wrong?

1527
02:00:14,868 --> 02:00:17,829
No, nothing's wrong with you.
I won your bet for you, haven't l?

1528
02:00:17,913 --> 02:00:20,790
That's enough for you!
I don't matter, I suppose?

1529
02:00:21,374 --> 02:00:25,003
You won my bet?
You presumptuous insect! I won it!

1530
02:00:25,086 --> 02:00:26,755
Why did you throw the slippers at me?

1531
02:00:26,838 --> 02:00:30,300
Because I wanted to smash your face.
I could kill you, you selfish brute!

1532
02:00:30,383 --> 02:00:32,552
Why didn't you leave me
where you picked me up?

1533
02:00:32,636 --> 02:00:36,431
You thank God it's all over. Now you can
throw me back again! Do you?

1534
02:00:36,515 --> 02:00:39,100
Oh, so the creature's nervous after all?

1535
02:00:42,354 --> 02:00:44,940
Claws in, you cat!
How dare you show your temper to me?

1536
02:00:45,023 --> 02:00:46,608
Sit down and be quiet!

1537
02:00:46,691 --> 02:00:49,319
What's to become of me?

1538
02:00:52,489 --> 02:00:54,407
How do I know what's to become of you?

1539
02:00:54,491 --> 02:00:55,700
What does it matter?

1540
02:00:55,784 --> 02:00:58,453
You don't care. I know you don't care.

1541
02:00:58,536 --> 02:01:01,039
You wouldn't care if I was dead.
I'm nothing to you.

1542
02:01:01,122 --> 02:01:02,999
Not as much as them slippers.

1543
02:01:03,083 --> 02:01:04,167
Those slippers!

1544
02:01:04,251 --> 02:01:07,921
Those slippers! I didn't think it meant
any difference now.

1545
02:01:11,508 --> 02:01:14,261
Why have you suddenly begun
going on like this?

1546
02:01:14,594 --> 02:01:17,264
May I ask if you complain
of your treatment here?

1547
02:01:17,347 --> 02:01:18,181
No.

1548
02:01:18,306 --> 02:01:21,434
Has anybody behaved badly?
Colonel Pickering, Mrs. Pearce?

1549
02:01:21,518 --> 02:01:22,560
No.

1550
02:01:22,852 --> 02:01:25,939
Well you don't pretend
that I have treated you badly?

1551
02:01:26,731 --> 02:01:27,774
No.

1552
02:01:27,857 --> 02:01:29,776
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

1553
02:01:30,777 --> 02:01:33,655
Perhaps you're tired
after the strain of the day.

1554
02:01:34,322 --> 02:01:36,700
Would you have a chocolate?

1555
02:01:37,033 --> 02:01:39,536
No, thank you.

1556
02:01:41,705 --> 02:01:45,709
Well, it's only natural that you should
be anxious, but it's all over now.

1557
02:01:45,792 --> 02:01:47,669
Nothing more to worry about.

1558
02:01:47,752 --> 02:01:50,630
No, nothing more for you to worry about.

1559
02:01:51,965 --> 02:01:54,676
Oh, God, I wish I was dead.

1560
02:01:55,301 --> 02:01:57,887
Why? ln heaven's name, why?

1561
02:01:58,722 --> 02:02:02,475
Now listen to me, Eliza.
All this irritation is purely subjective.

1562
02:02:02,851 --> 02:02:05,103
I don't understand. I'm too ignorant.

1563
02:02:05,186 --> 02:02:08,690
It's just imagination. Nothing's wrong.
Nobody's hurting you.

1564
02:02:08,773 --> 02:02:09,983
Go to bed and sleep it off.

1565
02:02:10,066 --> 02:02:14,529
Have a little cry and say your prayers.
You'll feel very much more comfortable.

1566
02:02:14,863 --> 02:02:16,698
I heard your prayers.

1567
02:02:16,865 --> 02:02:18,616
'"Thank God it's all over.'"

1568
02:02:18,742 --> 02:02:20,452
Don't you thank God it's all over?

1569
02:02:20,535 --> 02:02:22,954
Now you're free,
and you can do what you like.

1570
02:02:23,038 --> 02:02:26,166
Oh, what am I fit for?
What have you left me fit for?

1571
02:02:26,875 --> 02:02:29,627
Where am I to go? What am I to do?

1572
02:02:30,253 --> 02:02:32,338
And what's to become of me?

1573
02:02:33,423 --> 02:02:36,259
That's what's worrying you, is it?

1574
02:02:37,886 --> 02:02:39,846
I wouldn't worry about that if I were you.

1575
02:02:39,929 --> 02:02:44,350
I'm sure you won't have any difficulty
in settling yourself somewhere or other.

1576
02:02:47,103 --> 02:02:49,731
I didn't quite realize you were going away.

1577
02:02:50,774 --> 02:02:52,734
You might marry, you know.

1578
02:02:53,109 --> 02:02:57,030
You see, Eliza, all men are not confirmed
old bachelors like me and the Colonel.

1579
02:02:57,113 --> 02:03:00,116
Most men are the marrying sort,
poor devils.

1580
02:03:00,867 --> 02:03:01,868
You're not bad-looking.

1581
02:03:01,951 --> 02:03:04,454
You're really quite a pleasure
to look at sometimes.

1582
02:03:04,537 --> 02:03:06,080
Not now, when you've been crying.

1583
02:03:06,164 --> 02:03:07,957
You look like the very devil, but...

1584
02:03:08,041 --> 02:03:12,504
...when you're all right and quite yourself
you're what I would call attractive.

1585
02:03:14,422 --> 02:03:16,758
Go to bed, have a good rest,
get up in the morning...

1586
02:03:16,841 --> 02:03:20,637
...and have a look at yourself in the glass.
You won't feel so bad.

1587
02:03:25,099 --> 02:03:28,937
I daresay, my mother might find some
fellow or other who would do very well.

1588
02:03:29,020 --> 02:03:31,147
We were above that at Covent Garden.

1589
02:03:31,231 --> 02:03:32,690
What do you mean?

1590
02:03:32,899 --> 02:03:35,443
I sold flowers, I didn't sell myself.

1591
02:03:36,194 --> 02:03:39,322
Now you've made a lady of me,
I'm not fit to sell anything else.

1592
02:03:39,405 --> 02:03:42,075
Oh, tosh, Eliza.
Don't insult human relations...

1593
02:03:42,158 --> 02:03:45,203
...by dragging all that cant
about buying and selling into it.

1594
02:03:45,286 --> 02:03:47,372
Don't marry the fellow if you don't want to.

1595
02:03:47,455 --> 02:03:49,082
What else am I to do?

1596
02:03:49,165 --> 02:03:51,000
Oh, there are lots of things.

1597
02:03:51,084 --> 02:03:53,503
What about the old idea of a florist shop?

1598
02:03:53,586 --> 02:03:56,631
I'm sure Pickering'd set you up in one.
He's got lots of money.

1599
02:03:56,714 --> 02:03:58,675
He'll pay for all those togs you're wearing.

1600
02:03:58,758 --> 02:04:02,845
And that with the hire of the jewelry'll
make a big hole in 200 pounds.

1601
02:04:03,054 --> 02:04:05,431
Come on now. You'll be all right.

1602
02:04:06,599 --> 02:04:09,769
Well, I must be off to bed.
I'm really devilish sleepy.

1603
02:04:11,104 --> 02:04:13,398
I was looking for something. What was it?

1604
02:04:13,481 --> 02:04:14,691
Your slippers.

1605
02:04:15,191 --> 02:04:17,944
Oh, yes, of course. You shied them at me.

1606
02:04:19,070 --> 02:04:21,364
Before you go, sir.

1607
02:04:25,118 --> 02:04:28,121
Do my clothes belong to me
or to Colonel Pickering?

1608
02:04:29,205 --> 02:04:31,416
What the devil use would they be
to Pickering?

1609
02:04:31,499 --> 02:04:33,501
Why bother about that
in the middle of the night?

1610
02:04:33,584 --> 02:04:35,044
What may I take away with me?

1611
02:04:35,128 --> 02:04:37,547
I don't want to be accused of stealing.

1612
02:04:38,214 --> 02:04:39,299
Stealing?

1613
02:04:40,383 --> 02:04:43,678
You shouldn't have said that.
That shows a want of feeling.

1614
02:04:43,761 --> 02:04:47,807
I'm sorry. I'm a common, ignorant girl
and in my station I have to be careful.

1615
02:04:47,890 --> 02:04:51,352
There can't be any feelings between
the likes of you and the likes of me.

1616
02:04:51,436 --> 02:04:54,939
Please, will you tell me
what belongs to me and what doesn't?

1617
02:04:55,398 --> 02:04:57,775
Take the whole damned houseful
if you want.

1618
02:04:57,859 --> 02:05:00,611
Except the jewelry. That's hired.
Will that satisfy you?

1619
02:05:00,695 --> 02:05:01,946
Stop, please.

1620
02:05:04,157 --> 02:05:07,201
Will you take these to your room
and keep them safe?

1621
02:05:08,036 --> 02:05:10,955
I don't want to run the risk
of them being missed.

1622
02:05:12,540 --> 02:05:16,044
Hand them over! lf these belonged
to me and not the jeweler, I'd...

1623
02:05:16,127 --> 02:05:18,713
...l'd ram them down
your ungrateful throat.

1624
02:05:19,005 --> 02:05:23,092
The ring isn't the jeweler's.
It's the one you bought me in Brighton.

1625
02:05:24,427 --> 02:05:25,970
I don't want it now.

1626
02:05:29,223 --> 02:05:30,892
Don't you hit me!

1627
02:05:31,392 --> 02:05:34,562
Hit you? You infamous creature!
How dare you suggest such a thing!

1628
02:05:34,645 --> 02:05:37,315
It's you who've hit me.
You've wounded me to the heart.

1629
02:05:37,398 --> 02:05:40,985
I'm glad. I've got a little
of my own back anyhow.

1630
02:05:42,153 --> 02:05:45,740
You've caused me to lose my temper.
That's hardly happened to me before.

1631
02:05:45,823 --> 02:05:48,618
I don't wish to discuss it further tonight.
I'm going to bed.

1632
02:05:48,701 --> 02:05:51,287
Leave your own note for Mrs. Pearce
about the coffee...

1633
02:05:51,370 --> 02:05:52,955
...for it won't be done by me!

1634
02:05:53,039 --> 02:05:56,626
Damn Mrs. Pearce,
damn the coffee and damn you!

1635
02:05:57,877 --> 02:06:01,130
Damn my own folly for having lavished
my hard-earned knowledge...

1636
02:06:01,214 --> 02:06:05,384
...and the treasure of my regard
and intimacy on a heartless guttersnipe!

1637
02:06:56,644 --> 02:07:01,274
'"Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins

Freddy, whatever are you doing here?

1657
02:09:12,112 --> 02:09:15,991
Nothing. I spend most of my nights here.
It's the only place where I'm happy.

1658
02:09:16,075 --> 02:09:17,701
Don't laugh at me, Miss Doolittle.

1659
02:09:17,785 --> 02:09:22,122
Don't you call me '"Miss Doolittle,'"
do you hear? Eliza's good enough for me.

1660
02:09:24,041 --> 02:09:27,628
Freddy, you don't think

1661
02:09:27,711 --> 02:09:30,798
Darling, how could you imagine
such a thing? You know how I feel.

1662

Forgive me, ma'am. Early morning light
playing tricks with my eyes.

1719
02:14:27,719 --> 02:14:30,639
Can I get you a taxi?
A lady shouldn't be walkin' alone...

1720

We value your patronage always.

02:15:27,070 --> 02:15:30,115
Thank you, my good man. Thank you.
Here. Come 'ere.

1730
02:15:30,907 --> 02:15:33,493
Take the missus on a trip to Brighton
with my compliments.

1731
02:15:33,577 --> 02:15:35,412
Thank you, Mr. Doolittle.

1732
02:15:36,705 --> 02:15:39,875
Jolly spot this, Harry.
We must visit it more often.

1733
02:15:40,876 --> 02:15:41,835
Father?

1734
02:15:44,087 --> 02:15:47,424
Oh, no. You see, Harry, he has no mercy.

1735
02:15:47,716 --> 02:15:51,803
Sent her down to spy on me in me misery,
he did. Me own flesh and blood.

1736
02:15:54,764 --> 02:15:57,851
Well, I'm miserable, all right.
You can tell him that straight.

1737
02:15:57,934 --> 02:16:00,604
What are you talking about?
What are you dressed up for?

1738
02:16:00,687 --> 02:16:02,105
As if you didn't know.

1739
02:16:02,188 --> 02:16:06,192
Go on back to that Wimpole Street devil.
Tell him what he's done to me.

1740
02:16:06,401 --> 02:16:08,028
What's he done to you?

1741
02:16:08,445 --> 02:16:09,696
Ruined me, that's all.

1742
02:16:09,779 --> 02:16:13,617
Tied me up and delivered me
into the hands of middle-class morality.

1743
02:16:14,034 --> 02:16:15,410
And don't you defend him.

1744
02:16:15,493 --> 02:16:20,040
Was it 'im or was it not 'im wrote to an old
American blighter named Wallingford...

1745
02:16:20,123 --> 02:16:24,294
...who was giving $5,000,000
to found Moral Reform societies...

1746
02:16:24,794 --> 02:16:29,382
...to tell him the most original moralist
in England was Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle...

1747
02:16:29,466 --> 02:16:31,009
...a common dustman?

1748
02:16:32,510 --> 02:16:34,471
Sounds like one of his jokes.

1749
02:16:34,638 --> 02:16:37,849
You may call it a joke.
It's put the lid on me. Proper.

1750
02:16:38,141 --> 02:16:42,395
The old bloke died and left me
4,000 pounds a year in his bloomin' will.

1751
02:16:43,813 --> 02:16:47,942
Who asked him to make a gentleman
outta me? I was 'appy. I was free.

1752
02:16:48,526 --> 02:16:52,739
I touched pretty nigh everyone for money
when I wanted it, same as I touched him.

1753
02:16:52,822 --> 02:16:56,451
Now I'm tied neck and 'eels
and everybody touches me.

1754
02:16:57,160 --> 02:17:00,038
A year ago I 'adn't a relation in the world...

1755
02:17:00,747 --> 02:17:02,832
...except one or two
who wouldn't speak to me.

1756
02:17:02,916 --> 02:17:06,544
Now I've 50. Not a decent week's wages
amongst the lot of them.

1757
02:17:07,170 --> 02:17:11,841
I have to live for others now,
not for meself. Middle-class morality.

1758
02:17:12,550 --> 02:17:15,887
Come on, Alfie, in a few hours
we have to be at the church.

1759
02:17:15,970 --> 02:17:18,181
-Church?
-Yeah, church.

1760
02:17:19,182 --> 02:17:21,101
The deepest cut of all.

1761
02:17:21,601 --> 02:17:24,813
Why do you think I'm dressed up
like a ruddy pallbearer?

1762
02:17:25,355 --> 02:17:27,273
Your stepmother wants to marry me.

1763
02:17:27,357 --> 02:17:30,193
Now I'm respectable,
she wants to be respectable.

1764
02:17:30,485 --> 02:17:33,863
If that's the way you feel,
why don't you give the money back?

1765
02:17:33,947 --> 02:17:36,032
That's the tragedy of it, Eliza.

1766
02:17:36,282 --> 02:17:38,159
It's easy to say chuck it...

1767
02:17:38,993 --> 02:17:40,829
...but I 'aven't the nerve.

1768
02:17:41,162 --> 02:17:43,790
We're all intimidated.
That's what we are, intimidated.

1769
02:17:43,873 --> 02:17:46,543
Bought up. Yeah. That's what I am.

1770
02:17:47,293 --> 02:17:49,963
That's what your precious professor's
brought me to.

1771
02:17:50,046 --> 02:17:52,048
Not my precious professor.

1772
02:17:52,757 --> 02:17:54,676
Oh, sent you back, 'as he?

1773
02:17:56,344 --> 02:18:01,266
First he shoves me in the middle-class,
then he chucks you out for me to support.

1774
02:18:01,891 --> 02:18:03,893
That's all part of his plan...

1775
02:18:04,519 --> 02:18:06,438
...but you double-cross him.

1776
02:18:07,021 --> 02:18:11,192
Don't you come back home to me.
Don't you take tuppence from me.

1777
02:18:11,776 --> 02:18:15,321
You stand on your own two feet.
You're a lady now, you can do it.

1778
02:18:15,405 --> 02:18:18,366
Yeah, that's right, Eliza.
You're a lady now.

1779
02:18:19,033 --> 02:18:21,119
It's getting awfully cold in that taxi.

1780
02:18:21,202 --> 02:18:25,331
Here, Eliza, would you like to come
and see me turned off this morning?

1782
02:18:28,126 --> 02:18:30,170
I wouldn't advise it, but you're welcome.

02:18:30,253 --> 02:18:31,754
No, thank you, Dad.

1784
02:18:32,922 --> 02:18:35,091

1785
02:18:35,675 --> 02:18:38,678
Yes, Freddy, I'm all finished here.

I told you, sir, she took them all with her.

Here's a confounded thing. Eliza's bolted.

1866

Last night Mrs. Pearce let her go
without telling me about it!

1867

What'll I do? I got tea this morning
instead of coffee.

1868
02:25:21,455 --> 02:25:24,124
I don't know where anything is,
what my appointments are.

-Eliza'd know.
-Damn it, she's gone!

Did either of you frighten her last night?

1871
02:25:28,295 --> 02:25:30,506
We hardly said a word to her.
You were there.

1872
02:25:30,589 --> 02:25:32,424
Did you bully her after I went to bed?

1873
02:25:32,508 --> 02:25:33,884
She threw the slippers at me.

1874
02:25:33,968 --> 02:25:35,886
I never gave her the slightest provocation.

1875
02:25:35,970 --> 02:25:38,472
The slippers came at my head
before I uttered a word.

1876
02:25:38,555 --> 02:25:42,434
She used the most disgraceful language.
I was shocked! I don't understand.

1877
02:25:42,518 --> 02:25:45,187
We always gave her every consideration.
She admitted it.

1878
02:25:45,271 --> 02:25:46,146
I'm dashed!

1879
02:25:46,230 --> 02:25:49,775
Pickering, for God's sake,
stop being dashed and do something!

1880
02:25:49,858 --> 02:25:52,486
Phone the police. What are they there for?

1881
02:25:52,569 --> 02:25:55,072
You can't give Eliza's name to the police...

1882
02:25:55,155 --> 02:25:57,283
...as if she were a thief or a lost umbrella.

1883
02:25:57,366 --> 02:25:59,285
But why not? I want to find the girl.

1884
02:25:59,368 --> 02:26:02,079
She belongs to me.
I paid five pounds for her.

1885
02:26:02,329 --> 02:26:04,999
Quite right. Hello. Scotland Yard, please?

1886
02:26:05,332 --> 02:26:07,668
Get me some coffee, would you please?

1887
02:26:08,502 --> 02:26:09,753

1891
02:26:21,557 --> 02:26:23,851
Miss Eliza Doolittle.

1892
02:26:24,852 --> 02:26:25,936
About 21 .

1893
02:26:27,021 --> 02:26:29,898
I should say about 5 foot 7.

1894
02:26:31,150 --> 02:26:35,112
Her eyes? Let me think now. Her eyes....

1895
02:26:35,446 --> 02:26:37,197
-Brown.
-Brown.

1896
02:26:39,950 --> 02:26:44,663
Her hair? Good Lord.
Sort of a nondescript neutral sort of--

1897
02:26:44,747 --> 02:26:46,373
Brown, brown, brown!

1898
02:26:46,498 --> 02:26:49,168
You heard what he said?
Brown, brown, brown, yes.

1899
02:26:49,251 --> 02:26:51,754
No. This is her residence. 27A--

1900
02:26:51,837 --> 02:26:55,632
Yes, about between 3:00 and 4:00
this morning, I understand.

1901
02:26:56,800 --> 02:26:59,887
No.... She's no relation, no.

1902
02:27:00,846 --> 02:27:03,766
Well, let's call her a good friend, shall we?

1903
02:27:04,224 --> 02:27:05,684
I beg your pardon?

1904
02:27:05,809 --> 02:27:08,562
Listen to me, I don't like the tenor
of that question.

1905
02:27:08,645 --> 02:27:11,023
What the girl does here is our affair.

1906
02:27:12,316 --> 02:27:15,778
Your affair is to get her back
so she can continue doing it.

1907
02:27:16,403 --> 02:27:17,905
Well, I'm dashed!

1908

02:32:18,288 --> 02:32:22,083
Never petted you, or admired you,
or told you how splendid you'd been?

1990
02:32:22,167 --> 02:32:22,834
Not a word.

1991
02:32:22,917 --> 02:32:26,129
They just congratulated each other
on how marvelous they'd been.

1992
02:32:26,212 --> 02:32:28,715
The next moment, how glad they were
it was all over...

1993
02:32:28,798 --> 02:32:30,592
...and what a bore it had all been.

1994
02:32:30,675 --> 02:32:33,928
This is appalling. I should not
have thrown my slippers at him.

1995
02:32:34,012 --> 02:32:36,264
I should have thrown the fire irons.

1996
02:32:36,389 --> 02:32:37,557
Who's that?

1997
02:32:37,682 --> 02:32:40,393
Henry. I knew it wouldn't be too long.

1998
02:32:41,978 --> 02:32:43,355
Now, remember...

1999
02:32:44,105 --> 02:32:48,443
...you not only danced with a prince
last night, you behaved like a princess.

2000
02:32:55,325 --> 02:32:58,036
Mother, the most confounded thing....
Do you--

2001
02:33:01,581 --> 02:33:02,499
You!

2002
02:33:03,333 --> 02:33:06,461
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins.
Are you quite well?

2003
02:33:07,921 --> 02:33:12,050
Of course you are. You are never ill.
Would you care for some tea?

2004
02:33:12,842 --> 02:33:15,720
Don't you dare try that game on me.
I taught it to you.

2005
02:33:15,804 --> 02:33:17,555
Get up, come home and stop being a fool.

2006
02:33:17,639 --> 02:33:19,182
You've caused me enough trouble.

2007
02:33:19,265 --> 02:33:23,269
Very nicely put indeed, Henry.
No woman could resist such an invitation.

2008
02:33:23,353 --> 02:33:24,938
How did this baggage get here?

2009
02:33:25,021 --> 02:33:27,982
Eliza came to see me this morning
and I was delighted to have her.

2010
02:33:28,066 --> 02:33:31,027
If you don't promise to behave yourself
I'll ask you to leave.

2011
02:33:31,111 --> 02:33:33,113
I'm to put on my Sunday manners
for this...

2012
02:33:33,196 --> 02:33:36,991
...thing that I created out of the squashed
cabbage leaves of Covent Garden?

2013
02:33:37,075 --> 02:33:38,827
That's precisely what I mean.

2014
02:33:38,910 --> 02:33:40,495
I'll see her damned first.

2015
02:33:40,578 --> 02:33:43,706
However did you learn good manners
with my son around?

2016
02:33:43,915 --> 02:33:48,253
It was very difficult. I should never have
known how ladies and gentlemen behave...

2017
02:33:48,336 --> 02:33:50,964
...if it hadn't been for Colonel Pickering.

2018
02:33:52,382 --> 02:33:54,634
He showed me that he felt
and thought about me...

2019
02:33:54,717 --> 02:33:58,096
...as if I were something better
than a common flower girl.

2020
02:34:00,723 --> 02:34:04,310
You see, Mrs. Higgins,
apart from the things one can pick up...

2021
02:34:04,477 --> 02:34:08,231
...the difference between a lady
and a flower girl isn't how she behaves...

2022
02:34:08,314 --> 02:34:10,108
...but how she is treated.

2023
02:34:12,902 --> 02:34:15,405
I'll always be a flower girl
to Professor Higgins...

2024
02:34:15,530 --> 02:34:19,117
...because he always treats me
as a flower girl and always will.

2025
02:34:19,826 --> 02:34:21,953
I'll always be a lady to Colonel Pickering...

2026
02:34:22,078 --> 02:34:25,331
...because he always treats me
as a lady and always will.

2027
02:34:30,211 --> 02:34:31,671
Henry, don't grind your teeth.

2028
02:34:31,754 --> 02:34:34,591
The bishop is here.
Shall I show him into the garden?

2029
02:34:34,674 --> 02:34:37,176
The bishop and the professor?
Good heavens, no!

2030
02:34:37,260 --> 02:34:39,095
I should be excommunicated.

2031
02:34:39,429 --> 02:34:41,306
I'll see him in the library.

2032
02:34:42,098 --> 02:34:44,767
Eliza, if my son starts breaking up things...

2033
02:34:44,934 --> 02:34:47,645
...l give you full permission
to have him evicted.

2034
02:34:47,770 --> 02:34:51,941
Henry, I suggest you stick to two subjects:
the weather and your health.

2035
02:35:19,802 --> 02:35:21,804
You've had a bit of your own back,
as you say.

2036
02:35:21,888 --> 02:35:25,308
Have you had enough and will you
be reasonable or do you want any more?

2037
02:35:25,433 --> 02:35:27,393
You want me back to pick up
your slippers...

2038
02:35:27,518 --> 02:35:30,521
...and put up with your tempers
and fetch and carry for you.

2039
02:35:30,646 --> 02:35:32,398
I didn't say I wanted you back at all.

2040
02:35:32,482 --> 02:35:33,858
Then what are we talking about?

2041
02:35:33,983 --> 02:35:35,568
Well, about you, not about me.

2042
02:35:35,651 --> 02:35:38,363
If you come back you'll be treated
as you always have.

2043
02:35:38,488 --> 02:35:40,698
I can't change my nature or my manners.

2044
02:35:40,823 --> 02:35:43,618
My manners are exactly
the same as Colonel Pickering's.

2045
02:35:43,743 --> 02:35:47,497
That's not true. He treats a flower girl
as if she were a duchess.

2046
02:35:47,663 --> 02:35:49,874
I treat a duchess
as if she was a flower girl.

2047
02:35:49,999 --> 02:35:52,126
I see. The same to everybody.

2048
02:35:52,585 --> 02:35:55,338
The great secret is not a question
of good manners...

2049
02:35:55,421 --> 02:35:58,883
...or bad manners
or any particular sort of manner...

2050
02:35:59,425 --> 02:36:02,762
...but having the same manner
for all human souls.

2051
02:36:04,680 --> 02:36:07,058
The question is not
whether I treat you rudely...

2052
02:36:07,141 --> 02:36:10,561
...but whether you've ever heard me
treat anyone else better.

2053
02:36:10,686 --> 02:36:12,605
I don't care how you treat me.

2054
02:36:12,688 --> 02:36:15,775
I don't mind your swearing at me.
I shouldn't mind a black eye.

2055
02:36:15,858 --> 02:36:18,945
I've had one before this.
But I won't be passed over!

2056
02:36:19,195 --> 02:36:21,030
Get out of my way,
for I won't stop for you.

2057
02:36:21,114 --> 02:36:23,241
You talk about me as though
I was a motorbus.

2058
02:36:23,366 --> 02:36:27,537
So you are a motorbus. All bounce and go
and no consideration for anybody.

2059
02:36:27,787 --> 02:36:30,540
But I can get along without you.
Don't you think I can't!

2060
02:36:30,623 --> 02:36:33,042
I know you can. I told you, you could.

2061
02:36:36,462 --> 02:36:39,048
You've never wondered, I suppose,
whether...

2062
02:36:39,132 --> 02:36:41,676
...whether I could get along without you?

2063
02:36:42,802 --> 02:36:45,805
Don't you try to get around me.
You'll have to.

2064
02:36:47,056 --> 02:36:49,642
So I can, without you or any soul on earth.

2065
02:36:52,812 --> 02:36:56,983
I shall miss you, Eliza. I've learned
something from your idiotic notions.

2066
02:36:57,650 --> 02:37:00,194
I confess that humbly and gratefully.

2067
02:37:03,155 --> 02:37:05,533
Well, you have my voice
on your gramophone.

2068
02:37:05,616 --> 02:37:10,121
When you feel lonely without me you can
turn it on. It has no feelings to hurt.

2069
02:37:11,664 --> 02:37:14,375
Well, I can't turn your soul on.

2070
02:37:17,044 --> 02:37:19,297
You are a devil!

2071
02:37:20,256 --> 02:37:22,758
You can twist the heart in a girl
just as easily...

2072
02:37:22,842 --> 02:37:25,303
...as some can twist her arms to hurt her.

2073
02:37:25,386 --> 02:37:27,221
What am I to come back for?

2074
02:37:27,555 --> 02:37:29,640
For the fun of it. That's why I took you on.

2075
02:37:29,765 --> 02:37:32,476
You may throw me out tomorrow
if I don't do everything you want.

2076
02:37:32,602 --> 02:37:35,980
Yes. And you may walk out tomorrow
if I don't do everything you want.

2077
02:37:36,105 --> 02:37:37,273
And live with my father?

2078
02:37:37,356 --> 02:37:39,901
Yes, or sell flowers.
Would you rather marry Pickering?

2079
02:37:39,984 --> 02:37:43,738
I wouldn't marry you if you asked me
and you're nearer my age then what he is.

2080
02:37:43,863 --> 02:37:47,033
-Than he is.
-I'll talk as I like, you're not my teacher.

2081
02:37:47,158 --> 02:37:49,952
That's not what I want
and don't you think it is.

2082
02:37:50,036 --> 02:37:52,288
I've always had chaps enough
wanting me that way.

2083
02:37:52,413 --> 02:37:55,458
Freddy Hill writes me twice
and three times a day. Sheets and sheets.

2084
02:37:55,583 --> 02:37:59,503
In short, you want me to be
as infatuated about you as he is, is that it?

2085
02:37:59,629 --> 02:38:03,591
No, I don't. That's not the sort of feeling
I want from you.

2086
02:38:04,717 --> 02:38:06,427
I want a little kindness.

2087
02:38:06,886 --> 02:38:10,556
I know I'm a common, ignorant girl,
and you're a book-learned gentleman...

2088
02:38:10,640 --> 02:38:12,892
...but I'm not dirt under your feet.

2089
02:38:13,184 --> 02:38:18,147
What I done...what I did was not
for the taxis and the dresses...

2090
02:38:18,564 --> 02:38:22,234
...but because we were pleasant together
and I come to...came...

2091
02:38:23,611 --> 02:38:25,071
...to care for you.

2092
02:38:25,404 --> 02:38:27,156
Not to want you to make love to me...

2093
02:38:27,239 --> 02:38:30,326
...and not forgetting the difference
between us, but...

2094
02:38:30,409 --> 02:38:32,078
...more friendly like.

2095
02:38:34,288 --> 02:38:36,540
Well, of course. That's how I feel.

2096
02:38:37,208 --> 02:38:40,753
And how Pickering feels.
Eliza, you're a fool!

2097
02:38:40,836 --> 02:38:42,213
That's not the proper answer.

2098
02:38:42,338 --> 02:38:44,256
It's the only answer
till you stop being an idiot.

2099
02:38:44,340 --> 02:38:46,509
To be a lady, you must stop
feeling neglected...

2100
02:38:46,634 --> 02:38:49,220
...if men don't spend half their time
sniveling over you...

2101
02:38:49,345 --> 02:38:51,347
...and the other half giving you black eyes.

2102
02:38:51,430 --> 02:38:53,849
You find me cold, unfeeling, selfish,
don't you?

2103
02:38:53,974 --> 02:38:56,018
Off with you to the sort of people you like.

2104
02:38:56,102 --> 02:38:58,020
Marry a sentimental hog
with lots of money...

2105
02:38:58,145 --> 02:39:00,856
...and thick lips to kiss you,
and thick boots to kick you.

2106
02:39:00,940 --> 02:39:04,110
If you can't appreciate what you have,
then get what you can appreciate.

2107
02:39:04,485 --> 02:39:07,279
I can't talk to you.
You always turn everything against me.

2108
02:39:07,405 --> 02:39:09,073
I'm always in the wrong.

2109
02:39:09,323 --> 02:39:11,534
Don't be too sure you have me
under your feet...

2110
02:39:11,659 --> 02:39:13,744
...to be trampled on and talked down.

2111
02:39:13,869 --> 02:39:17,373
I'll marry Freddy, I will,
as soon as I'm able to support him.

2112
02:39:18,874 --> 02:39:21,460
The poor devil who couldn't get a job
as an errand boy...

2113
02:39:21,585 --> 02:39:23,504
...even if he had the guts to try?

2114
02:39:23,629 --> 02:39:27,341
Don't you understand?
I have made you a consort for a king!

2115
02:39:27,550 --> 02:39:30,469
Freddy loves me.
That makes him king enough for me.

2116
02:39:30,594 --> 02:39:33,556
I don't want him to work.
He wasn't brought up to do it as I was.

2117
02:39:33,681 --> 02:39:35,391
I'll go and be a teacher.

2118
02:39:35,850 --> 02:39:37,810
What'll you teach, in heaven's name?

2119
02:39:37,935 --> 02:39:40,437
What you taught me. I'll teach phonetics.

2120
02:39:44,859 --> 02:39:49,071
I'll offer myself as an assistant
to that brilliant Hungarian.

2121
02:39:49,989 --> 02:39:53,617
What, that imposter? That humbug?
That toadying ignoramus?

2122
02:39:54,034 --> 02:39:56,162
Teach him my methods, my discoveries?

2123
02:39:56,287 --> 02:39:58,873
You take one step in that direction,
I'll wring your neck!

2124
02:39:58,998 --> 02:40:02,418
Wring away! What do I care?
I knew you'd strike me one day.

2125
02:40:05,713 --> 02:40:08,632
That's done you, 'Enry 'lggins, it 'as.

2126
02:40:08,757 --> 02:40:11,802
Now, I don't care for your bullyin'
an' your big talk.
