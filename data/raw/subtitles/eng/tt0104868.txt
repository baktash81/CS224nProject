1
00:00:28,378 --> 00:00:31,644
...The Minnesota Pee Wee
Championship is up for grabs.

2
00:00:31,716 --> 00:00:35,243
Both teams playing like there's
no tomorrow. Duluth, in the Hawks'zone,

3
00:00:35,353 --> 00:00:37,821
looking for a chance to win it.
Only a few seconds remain.

4
00:00:37,889 --> 00:00:40,687
There's a pass out to the blue line.
Intercepted by Gordon Bombay!

5
00:00:40,758 --> 00:00:43,022
Bombay! He's got a breakaway.

6
00:00:43,094 --> 00:00:45,722
Across the blue line all alone
for a chance to win the game!

7
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,594
He's pulled down from behind
by Fox of Duluth.

8
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,863
Fox definitely pulled him down
from behind and this could be -

9
00:00:51,936 --> 00:00:54,769
Yes, the referee calls
for a penalty shot.

10
00:01:06,351 --> 00:01:11,050
Gordon, it's up to you. I don't wanna
see any goats around after the game.

11
00:01:11,122 --> 00:01:14,387
You got it?
Now, you miss this shot...

12
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:17,917
you're not just lettin' me down,
you're lettin' your team down.

13
00:01:39,382 --> 00:01:41,647
Apressure situation he's in now.

14
00:01:41,753 --> 00:01:45,416
The 1973 Pee Wee State
Championship now rests...

15
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:50,427
on the little shoulders
of number 9, Gordon Bombay.

16
00:01:56,633 --> 00:02:06,170
Gordon! Gordon!

17
00:02:37,108 --> 00:02:40,942
Let's go, son!
All right!

18
00:03:01,965 --> 00:03:05,834
He hit the goalpost!
What a heartbreaker!

19
00:03:05,903 --> 00:03:08,963
Little Gordon Bombay
had the chance -

20
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:50,199
All my client did was attempt
to give you what you wanted!

21
00:03:50,276 --> 00:03:52,244
Isn't that right?

22
00:03:52,311 --> 00:03:55,246
This man put his neck
on the line for your greed.

23
00:03:55,314 --> 00:03:57,407
Objection. Your Honour?

24
00:03:57,483 --> 00:03:59,713
Will both counsellors
approach the bench?

25
00:04:03,055 --> 00:04:06,388
What's he doing?

26
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:09,053
I don't have anything to tell you.
I just wanna make a point.

27
00:04:09,128 --> 00:04:11,562
So nod like I'm saying
something important.

28
00:04:11,597 --> 00:04:14,760
- Mr. Bombay?
- Gordon, what are you doing?

29
00:04:14,834 --> 00:04:17,632
- Get out there and be my lawyer.
- Perfect.

30
00:04:17,737 --> 00:04:20,103
This drives him nuts
and I love it.

31
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:24,640
Nice tie, Frank.
You wore that yesterday, didn't ya?

32
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:27,838
Oh, Mr. Bombay,
I'm so glad you could make it.

33
00:04:27,947 --> 00:04:31,405
Please restrict yourself
to a relevant cross-examination!

34
00:04:31,484 --> 00:04:34,817
Your Honour, the applicability
of societal intent...

35
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,286
vis-a-vis individual action
is well established.

36
00:04:37,356 --> 00:04:40,257
I'm citing
Minneapolis V. Higgins.

37
00:04:40,326 --> 00:04:45,423
The appellant court overruled a judge
who disallowed similar testimony.

38
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:49,627
Now, if I'm not mistaken,
that was... you.

39
00:04:49,702 --> 00:04:51,636
Wasn't it,Judge Weathers?

40
00:04:51,704 --> 00:04:56,107
I stand corrected, counsellor.
Objection overruled.

41
00:04:56,175 --> 00:04:59,975
Oh,you really stooped
to an all-time low on this, Bombay.

42
00:05:00,045 --> 00:05:03,708
I'm insulted, Frank.
You have no idea how low I can stoop.

43
00:05:03,816 --> 00:05:06,341
I don't mind losing.
I would just like to lose fair.

44
00:05:06,452 --> 00:05:09,387
Losing fair is still losing, Frank.
Gotta go for the "W" every time.

45
00:05:09,488 --> 00:05:12,150
And what about justice?
That man should be in jail.

46
00:05:12,224 --> 00:05:15,216
It was your job to put him there.
Don't take it out on me!

47
00:05:15,327 --> 00:05:18,990
Next time do your job,
Frankie boy.

48
00:05:19,064 --> 00:05:21,464
- 30 and 0! I remain undefeated.
- What about the Frazier case?

49
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:24,560
We don't count that one because
I scored with the court reporter.

50
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:27,332
- The one you said had the intelligent body?
- That's the one.

51
00:05:27,406 --> 00:05:29,340
- No calls on the Duck phone?
- Not yet.

52
00:05:29,408 --> 00:05:31,672
What's he waiting for?
I saw him in the back of the courtroom.

53
00:05:31,744 --> 00:05:33,974
How about some kudos here, huh?

54
00:05:34,046 --> 00:05:36,981
Mr. Tolbert dropped off ringside
seats for tonight's North Stars game.

55
00:05:37,049 --> 00:05:39,381
Hockey?
Forget it!

56
00:05:39,485 --> 00:05:41,510
Gordon, here's the research
for the Pearlstein Project.

57
00:05:41,587 --> 00:05:43,714
- Can you get started?
- Jane!

58
00:05:43,823 --> 00:05:46,724
Can't you see I'm reveling here?
Today I'm 30 and 0!

59
00:05:46,826 --> 00:05:51,058
- 30 and one.
- Type,Jeannie, don't speak.

60
00:05:51,163 --> 00:05:54,098
Mr. Bombay's office.

61
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,658
Yes. It's Ducksworth.
You're right. He wants to see you.

62
00:05:57,736 --> 00:06:01,331
Ha-ha-ha!
Thank you very much, Mr. Ducksworth!

63
00:06:01,407 --> 00:06:05,867
It was nothing, Mr. Ducksworth.
Quack, quack, quack, Mr. Ducksworth.

64
00:06:08,747 --> 00:06:11,341
Gordon, another fine job today.

65
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:14,181
- Thank you, sir.
- Just one thing.

66
00:06:14,253 --> 00:06:17,745
Score. Don't spike.

67
00:06:17,857 --> 00:06:20,519
I'm not sure I understand
what you mean, sir.

68
00:06:20,593 --> 00:06:24,085
This is a business.
It isn't a game.

69
00:06:24,196 --> 00:06:26,687
Next time a little
restraint might be in order.

70
00:06:36,787 --> 00:06:41,622
~Hey, man, get off my back
I'm doin'the best I can,yeah ~

71
00:06:44,261 --> 00:06:46,252
~ You bust my neck
Cut no slack ~

72
00:06:46,329 --> 00:06:52,268
- ~Forget your fellow man
Yeah yeah uh-huh ~

73
00:06:52,335 --> 00:06:56,431
- Pull your vehicle over to the right, now!
- This is not good.

74
00:07:04,748 --> 00:07:07,273
- ~ Hey, man, whoa yeah yeah ~
- Licence, please.

75
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:11,980
- Could you turn down the stereo?
- Sure.

76
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:14,114
I guess it was a "widdle" noisy.

77
00:07:14,191 --> 00:07:16,284
A "widdle"?

78
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:19,260
Okay, I'm taking you down to precinct.
Breath, blood or urine?

79
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:21,957
No, thanks, I'm full.

80
00:07:22,032 --> 00:07:25,331
Okay, out of the car. Now.

81
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:29,531
The charges against Mr. Bombay
are driving under the influence,

82
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,473
driving with an open container
and reckless endangerment.

83
00:07:33,543 --> 00:07:37,138
And to think I almost
stayed home this morning.

84
00:07:37,214 --> 00:07:39,614
I assume you're
representing yourself?

85
00:07:39,683 --> 00:07:44,120
Twelve moving violations in three years?
How do you still have a licence?

86
00:07:44,187 --> 00:07:46,781
Okay, let's talk business.
What am I facing?

87
00:07:46,857 --> 00:07:49,951
Suspension of licence?
Fines? What?

88
00:07:50,026 --> 00:07:53,325
Yes, unless the D.A.'s office will allow
you to plead guilty to lesser charges.

89
00:07:53,396 --> 00:07:56,729
But that's solely
up to the prosecutor.

90
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:59,893
The city of Minneapolis does not wish
to pursue a plea bargain in this case.

91
00:08:00,003 --> 00:08:03,905
- Hmm.
- Gotta go for the "W," right, Gordo?

92
00:08:04,007 --> 00:08:07,807
The defendant is released
on his own recognizance.

93
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:14,813
Mr. Ducksworth.
What are you doing here?

94
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:17,683
I own the place.
How about you?

95
00:08:17,754 --> 00:08:20,518
Just goin' over a few cases.
RICOH Statute stuff.

96
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,889
Oh, I thought you might be
researching your defence...

97
00:08:23,994 --> 00:08:28,090
against D.U.I.
and reckless endangerment.

98
00:08:28,198 --> 00:08:31,258
Did you think I wouldn't
find out, Gordon?

99
00:08:31,368 --> 00:08:33,529
There was no reason to concern you
with it, sir. They have no case.

100
00:08:33,603 --> 00:08:37,198
Frank Huddy just wants my scalp. I found
a loophole. I'm gonna plead not guilty -

101
00:08:37,274 --> 00:08:40,402
Gordon, stop it.
There's not going to be a loophole.

102
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,274
There's not going to be a trial.
I am not going to have you drag...

103
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,439
this firm's good name
through the mud.

104
00:08:45,549 --> 00:08:50,111
I've talked toJudge Weathers
and he has agreed to suspend your case.

105
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,020
- Under what conditions?
- Probation, suspension of your driver's licence...

106
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,684
and 500 hours
of community service.

107
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,694
And a leave of absence
from the firm.

108
00:08:58,762 --> 00:09:02,061
A leave of absence?
He can't do that.

109
00:09:02,132 --> 00:09:05,465
- He can't stop me from working!
- He's not. I am.

110
00:09:05,569 --> 00:09:09,061
That was my condition.
Gordon, you need a break.

111
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:13,132
- You're too wrapped up in your work.
- But, sir, my work is my life.

112
00:09:13,243 --> 00:09:17,771
That's just my point.
The community service will do you good.

113
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:21,874
It'll teach you compassion,
a sense of fair play, how to fit in.

114
00:09:21,952 --> 00:09:25,911
- Community service? This is horrible.
- You'll get used to it.

115
00:09:25,989 --> 00:09:29,152
And hopefully you'll come back
a better person and a better attorney,

116
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:33,423
which is why I'm keeping you on salary
and have arranged a driver for you.

117
00:09:33,496 --> 00:09:38,763
You know, in the early '7 Os I drove the
tour bus for The Grand Funk Railroad.

118
00:09:38,835 --> 00:09:42,100
Man, that was the life.
Chicks, parties,

119
00:09:42,172 --> 00:09:44,265
amps cranked up to about
eight jillion decibels.

120
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:48,072
All that loud music damaged my hearing,
but I got no regrets...

121
00:09:48,144 --> 00:09:51,602
- except for the '80s.
- How could he do this to me?

122
00:09:51,681 --> 00:09:55,310
Community service...
coaching hockey!

123
00:09:58,521 --> 00:10:00,614
I found one!
I'm comin' out!

124
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,954
Karp,you finally found
something for once in your life.

125
00:10:03,026 --> 00:10:05,790
Dumpster Dave comes through!

126
00:10:05,862 --> 00:10:10,094
- What do you think?
- Lovely, Karp, it goes with your eyes.

127
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:13,693
- You gonna take that from him, Karp?
- Remind me to bust you, Averman.

128
00:10:13,803 --> 00:10:16,465
- Thanks, Peter. Thanks very much.
- Did you get it?

129
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:20,976
- Yeah! Right there!
- Yeah!

130
00:10:21,044 --> 00:10:23,672
Here, Petie. Here, boy.

131
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,180
A little chili
to keep you warm, buddy.

132
00:10:26,283 --> 00:10:31,687
- Oh, yeah, that's nice.
- Oh, yeah, look!

133
00:10:31,788 --> 00:10:34,313
I can't believe he ate the can too.

134
00:10:34,391 --> 00:10:36,825
He sniffs.

135
00:10:36,893 --> 00:10:40,727
He sniffs again.
Looking for that perfect place.

136
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,298
He sniffs some more. He stops.

137
00:10:43,366 --> 00:10:46,301
I think this is it!
He's turnin' in a circle.

138
00:10:46,369 --> 00:10:50,829
- He squats! He scores!
- Yes! We did it!

139
00:10:50,907 --> 00:10:54,741
Full load.

140
00:10:54,844 --> 00:10:58,007
Stinks!

141
00:10:58,081 --> 00:11:00,413
Come on, come on, give me the dollar!

142
00:11:00,517 --> 00:11:02,508
- Hurry it up already.
- I'm hurryin', okay?

143
00:11:02,585 --> 00:11:05,179
- Go, go, go, go!
- Yeah! All right! Let's do it!

144
00:11:10,593 --> 00:11:13,391
Oh, come on. Stop!

145
00:11:13,496 --> 00:11:17,159
- Yes!
- Okay! Here we go.

146
00:11:21,438 --> 00:11:24,703
Yeah. There's more inside.

147
00:11:24,774 --> 00:11:26,867
He's takin'off with it.

148
00:11:26,943 --> 00:11:29,844
This guy deserves what he gets.

149
00:11:44,361 --> 00:11:46,261
Oh, guys, he saw us.

150
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:13,212
Oh, my!

151
00:12:20,663 --> 00:12:22,426
Rink's gotta be
around here someplace.

152
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:25,263
Just look for a sign
that says " Personal Hell. "

153
00:12:25,335 --> 00:12:29,066
How could he do this to me?
I hate kids. They're barely human.

154
00:12:32,609 --> 00:12:34,907
Come on! Over here!

155
00:12:34,978 --> 00:12:36,639
Keep it down, please!

156
00:12:36,746 --> 00:12:39,579
Hey, come on.
There's no need for this.

157
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:41,742
Let's talk, come on.
I'm your friend, aren't I?

158
00:12:41,818 --> 00:12:46,016
Come on, Goldberg, at least try to
stop it. I'm tired of chasin' the puck.

159
00:12:46,122 --> 00:12:49,091
Be careful, man.
It almost hit me that time.

160
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:51,957
Goldberg, you're the goalie.
It's supposed to hit you.

161
00:12:52,028 --> 00:12:54,087
Does that sound stupid
to anyone else?

162
00:12:58,334 --> 00:13:02,998
Good God.
That's the hockey team.

163
00:13:03,106 --> 00:13:08,134
Drive out on the ice.
It'll be all right.

164
00:13:15,552 --> 00:13:18,043
I ain't scared.

165
00:13:18,154 --> 00:13:21,646
- You don't know what you're doin'.
- Shut your face, Karp.

166
00:13:21,724 --> 00:13:24,192
We're gonna get in big trouble.

167
00:13:24,294 --> 00:13:27,161
- I'll take care of it.
- They're drugs, I just know it.

168
00:13:37,507 --> 00:13:41,568
Yo, dude.
You obviously in the wrong hood.

169
00:13:41,678 --> 00:13:45,705
This is my dominion. This is
a drug-free zone, you understand?

170
00:13:45,815 --> 00:13:49,546
We ain't buyin' nothin'.
I'm feelin' generous today.

171
00:13:49,652 --> 00:13:52,485
So I'm gonna let you get your
sorry vanilla bootie outta here...

172
00:13:52,555 --> 00:13:56,548
before we be usin'
your eyeballs as hockey pucks.

173
00:13:56,659 --> 00:14:01,926
Thanks, bro, but I'm not goin' home
'til I take care of business.

174
00:14:02,031 --> 00:14:05,330
He's got a gun.
Stand back.

175
00:14:08,171 --> 00:14:09,661
Whew!

176
00:14:09,739 --> 00:14:12,230
District Five Pee Wee hockey team.

177
00:14:12,342 --> 00:14:14,742
I'm Gordon Bombay.
I'm the new coach.

178
00:14:14,844 --> 00:14:17,904
What a joke!

179
00:14:18,014 --> 00:14:20,744
- Yeah, right.
- Afraid so, dude.

180
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:25,378
Got the roster right here.
Averman, Dave.

181
00:14:25,455 --> 00:14:28,788
Conway, Charlie.
Hall, Terry.

182
00:14:28,892 --> 00:14:33,056
Here's the long and the short of it.
I hate hockey and I don't like kids.

183
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:35,427
What's this supposed to be,
a pep talk?

184
00:14:35,532 --> 00:14:38,729
I'm sure this'll be
a real bonding experience.

185
00:14:38,801 --> 00:14:41,736
Maybe one day one of you
will even write a book about it in jail.

186
00:14:41,804 --> 00:14:44,204
- Funny.
- Is there a goalie?

187
00:14:44,274 --> 00:14:46,299
Only for a little while.
I'm movin' back to Philly.

188
00:14:46,409 --> 00:14:48,536
- Thank you for sharing that.
- No problem.

189
00:14:48,611 --> 00:14:52,047
All right, get out on the ice.
Let me see what you can do.

190
00:14:52,115 --> 00:14:55,551
Uh,just so you know.
We really suck.

191
00:14:55,618 --> 00:14:58,109
I'll decide
who sucks around here.

192
00:15:01,824 --> 00:15:05,658
- Get off me.
- They really suck.

193
00:15:08,064 --> 00:15:11,090
The Pete-meister.
Mr. Rabble-rouser.

194
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:14,261
Passing the puck
over toJesse-roonie, the enforcer.

195
00:15:14,337 --> 00:15:16,635
Ouch!

196
00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:18,639
That hurt!

197
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:23,405
Oh, it's the Connie-meister,
the velvet hammer.

198
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:25,413
Hi, coach. I'm Connie.

199
00:15:25,481 --> 00:15:28,973
- Do you play?
- No. So what's our record anyway?

200
00:15:29,085 --> 00:15:32,145
0 and 9. One was pretty close, though.
We only lost by five.

201
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:35,019
We almost scored a goal too.

202
00:15:35,124 --> 00:15:37,786
So what do we do now... coach?

203
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,761
- What did your old coach have you do?
- He just yelled a lot.

204
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:43,765
- That's how he hurt his arm.
- His arm?

205
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:47,360
Yeah, one minute he's yelling at us, "
Little bastards, where'd you learn to play?

206
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:52,100
Oh, you suck, you!
Skate, you little bast-"

207
00:15:52,175 --> 00:15:54,643
Heart attack. Great.

208
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:57,271
All right, look.
I gotta make a phone call.

209
00:15:57,347 --> 00:16:00,339
Keep scrimmaging. You, you, you,
you and you against you four.

210
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:03,681
- We got names, you know?
- I'm sure you do.

211
00:16:03,786 --> 00:16:06,311
And I'll bet they're very nice names.
I might even learn 'em.

212
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:08,220
For now, I'll be in my office.

213
00:16:08,324 --> 00:16:11,657
Oh, and if you
need anything, fax me.

214
00:16:11,728 --> 00:16:13,855
Geez, what a jerk.

215
00:16:13,963 --> 00:16:16,693
Where do they find these coaches
anyways? We're impressionable kids, right?

216
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:18,960
Shouldn't we check
his qualifications or somethin'?

217
00:16:19,035 --> 00:16:23,062
Jeannie, who told you
not to give me my messages?

218
00:16:23,172 --> 00:16:27,336
Ducksworth!
Then who's handling my cases?

219
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,401
- On three!
- Jane!

220
00:16:29,512 --> 00:16:31,480
- One, two, three! Charge!
- Are you kidding me?

221
00:16:31,547 --> 00:16:34,311
She's outta law school one year.
She's not qualified to -

222
00:16:34,384 --> 00:16:36,352
Hold on a second!

223
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:41,356
Hey! Get your mouth off the windows!

224
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:46,892
- Hey!
- Get off there!

225
00:16:46,996 --> 00:16:50,227
Get off the car!

226
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:54,929
- We're being invaded!
- Get off!

227
00:16:55,038 --> 00:16:58,166
- Get off the roof, you little monkey.
- Oh, cool!

228
00:16:58,241 --> 00:17:00,539
- Is that a real phone?
- Yes, and I'm really on it.

229
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,578
- Not any more.
- Thank you.

230
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:06,171
- Let's see, who should I -
- Watch the upholstery.

231
00:17:09,552 --> 00:17:13,454
- Don't touch that.
- We wanna ride!

232
00:17:13,556 --> 00:17:16,184
We wanna ride! We wanna ride!

233
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:20,093
- We wanna ride!
- I could kill one of'em just to set an example.

234
00:17:20,196 --> 00:17:24,064
Not yet, Lewis.
Take 'em for a spin, anything!

235
00:17:30,773 --> 00:17:34,573
This looks good.
I'm gonna eat it.

236
00:17:34,644 --> 00:17:36,703
- Wow, I feel like Madonna.
- You wish!

237
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:38,576
Seats ten comfortably.

238
00:17:38,648 --> 00:17:43,051
Hey, pass me one of those glasses.

239
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:46,282
Yeah, I see your point.

240
00:17:46,389 --> 00:17:48,323
Oh.

241
00:17:48,424 --> 00:17:52,451
Goldberg!

242
00:17:52,562 --> 00:17:55,622
- It wasn't me, all right!
- Young man, what did you eat?

243
00:17:55,732 --> 00:17:58,428
- Nothing! It wasn't me!
- Open a window!

244
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:01,902
Oh, man! It's my mom!

245
00:18:01,971 --> 00:18:04,166
- She looks pissed.
- Oh, man.

246
00:18:06,476 --> 00:18:09,240
All right, out!
Everybody, out of the car right now.

247
00:18:09,312 --> 00:18:13,510
Goldberg, why'd you
have to ruin the fun?

248
00:18:13,616 --> 00:18:16,813
Are you out of your mind? What were you
thinking putting that car on the ice?

249
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,114
- My son was in that car.
- Lady, lady, relax.

250
00:18:19,188 --> 00:18:22,157
One crack in the ice.
That's all it would take. One crack!

251
00:18:22,258 --> 00:18:23,987
- The ice is not gonna crack.
- Who do you think you are?

252
00:18:24,093 --> 00:18:27,426
- I'm Gordon Bombay, the new hockey coach.
- The new coach?

253
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:30,125
They send you over here to coach
the team and you endanger their lives.

254
00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:33,259
What danger? I grew up on the ice;
I know when it's safe to drive on.

255
00:18:33,336 --> 00:18:35,998
- How do you know?
- I just know! All right?

256
00:18:36,105 --> 00:18:40,041
Well, listen, Mr. Zen Master, you may be
in tune with the ice universe,

257
00:18:40,143 --> 00:18:43,510
but when it comes to my kid,
"I just know" doesn't cut it.

258
00:18:43,613 --> 00:18:46,605
Charlie, let's go.

259
00:18:46,682 --> 00:18:51,016
- Mom?
- Give me my candy! All of it!

260
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,715
Well, I guess practise is over.

261
00:18:54,824 --> 00:18:58,555
- Sorry my mom ruined it, guys.
- It's all right, Charlie.

262
00:18:58,661 --> 00:19:01,687
Coach, gonna be
at the game tomorrow?

263
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:05,325
By order of the state
of Minnesota, yeah.

264
00:19:05,501 --> 00:19:10,063
Hawks! Hawks! Hawks!

265
00:19:10,173 --> 00:19:13,074
Hawks! Hawks! Hawks!
Hawks! Hawks! Hawks!

266
00:19:13,176 --> 00:19:15,838
Hawks! Hawks! Hawks!

267
00:19:15,912 --> 00:19:20,144
One, two, three, four, five!
One, two, three, four, five!

268
00:19:20,216 --> 00:19:23,549
One, two, three, four, five!

269
00:19:31,093 --> 00:19:33,994
- Hi, girls.
- Karp! No!

270
00:19:34,063 --> 00:19:37,157
Goodbye.

271
00:20:00,523 --> 00:20:05,222
The hawks. My first game
and it had to be the Hawks.

272
00:20:06,295 --> 00:20:09,389
Gordon? Gordon Bombay.

273
00:20:09,465 --> 00:20:12,400
- Coach Reilly.
- We're both adults now.

274
00:20:12,468 --> 00:20:14,459
Why don't you
just call meJack?

275
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:17,801
Hey, come back
to see your old coach, huh?

276
00:20:17,907 --> 00:20:22,401
Well, actually I'm, uh,
coaching... Pee Wee.

277
00:20:22,478 --> 00:20:28,041
- District Five team.
- No kiddin'. You got a kid on the team or something?

278
00:20:28,117 --> 00:20:32,247
No, I'm here because I need
to be of service to the community.

279
00:20:32,321 --> 00:20:35,984
How about this, huh? Whoever thought
we'd be coachin' against each other?

280
00:20:36,092 --> 00:20:38,652
Yeah, who'd have thought?

281
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:41,491
So, who's your hotshot
player this year?

282
00:20:41,597 --> 00:20:43,963
- Anyone good?
- I got a kid named Banks.

283
00:20:44,066 --> 00:20:47,763
Might go all the way.
Not quite as good as you were.

284
00:20:47,837 --> 00:20:50,738
But he wants it more.
Kid won't give up.

285
00:20:54,977 --> 00:20:56,638
Oh, boy,

286
00:20:58,681 --> 00:21:02,583
I wish they would
take that one down. Don't you?

287
00:21:04,253 --> 00:21:06,744
Well, good luck.

288
00:21:06,822 --> 00:21:09,916
You're gonna need it.

289
00:21:09,992 --> 00:21:14,429
It's up to you, Gordon.
You miss this shot, you're not just...

290
00:21:14,497 --> 00:21:17,261
letting me down, you're letting
your whole team down too.

291
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:20,131
I wish your dad
could be here to see this.

292
00:21:20,202 --> 00:21:23,501
Make him proud of you!

293
00:21:23,606 --> 00:21:27,133
Win! Win! Win!

294
00:21:28,778 --> 00:21:32,179
All right, guys, gather round.
Come on, come on.

295
00:21:32,281 --> 00:21:35,148
- Win! Win! Win!
- Win. Win.

296
00:21:35,217 --> 00:21:38,516
Win! Win! Win!

297
00:21:38,621 --> 00:21:41,784
- Win?
- Win! Win! Win!

298
00:21:41,857 --> 00:21:45,156
Yeah, we're fired up.

299
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:52,996
All right! Watch this!

300
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:57,005
Oh, great. Good concept, guys.
Nice - ouch!

301
00:21:57,073 --> 00:21:59,974
Nice goin', fool!

302
00:22:00,042 --> 00:22:03,239
- Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.
- Oh, yeah, "I didn't mean to. "

303
00:22:03,346 --> 00:22:05,678
Yeah, sure,
you're on my own team.

304
00:22:05,748 --> 00:22:08,182
Oh, sorry, Goldberg.
Didn't mean to.

305
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,411
Would you get off me
before I clock you?

306
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:14,751
Let's go,Jesse!
Go, Terry!

307
00:22:14,857 --> 00:22:18,691
Let's go! Come on in.

308
00:22:18,761 --> 00:22:21,525
What's this?
The Oreo line!

309
00:22:21,597 --> 00:22:23,861
Hey, come on.
Let's play hockey.

310
00:22:23,933 --> 00:22:26,527
Um, batter, batter,
hum, batter, batter!

311
00:22:26,602 --> 00:22:29,901
Hey, batter, batter,
swing, batter, batter!

312
00:22:30,006 --> 00:22:32,770
- Hum, batter, batter, swing, batter, batter!
- Averman!

313
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:36,538
It's hockey!
There's no batter. Idiot.

314
00:22:36,612 --> 00:22:38,944
Hum, goalie, goalie,
hum, goalie, goalie!

315
00:22:39,048 --> 00:22:41,516
Hey, goalie, goalie,
save, goalie, goalie!

316
00:22:41,584 --> 00:22:44,246
Hum, goalie, goalie,
hey, goalie, goalie!

317
00:22:55,097 --> 00:22:57,725
No, I got him!
I, I, I got him!

318
00:23:06,275 --> 00:23:09,142
That's one!

319
00:23:09,245 --> 00:23:11,213
Hey, hey, hey! Easy!

320
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,477
Good show. Sloppy pass.

321
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:17,814
Way to stuff it, Banks!

322
00:23:20,056 --> 00:23:23,253
All right, all right! Let's run it up!
Run it up! Run it up!

323
00:23:31,901 --> 00:23:34,267
Oh, man! How could you
let him get by you?

324
00:23:35,905 --> 00:23:38,635
All right, line change.
Come on, go, go, go.

325
00:23:43,345 --> 00:23:47,645
Hey!

326
00:23:52,488 --> 00:23:55,355
Banks! Banks! Banks!

327
00:23:58,027 --> 00:24:00,461
Hey, you!
Come back here! Oh!

328
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:03,020
Why me?

329
00:24:05,701 --> 00:24:09,637
How lazy can you be?
They're killing us out there!

330
00:24:09,705 --> 00:24:12,970
How many times do I have to tell you:
Get those rebounds,

331
00:24:13,042 --> 00:24:15,943
get your heads up,
get those loose pucks.

332
00:24:16,011 --> 00:24:17,979
Get - Just -

333
00:24:18,047 --> 00:24:20,845
Just get the hell outta here.

334
00:24:25,221 --> 00:24:28,281
All right!

335
00:24:28,357 --> 00:24:30,621
It's Spaz-way. He'll screw up.

336
00:24:42,638 --> 00:24:46,301
Hey, hey! Way to play it, Banks!
All right!

337
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:50,141
That's okay, Charlie!
Nice try!

338
00:24:50,212 --> 00:24:53,204
Nice fan, Charlie. Keep swingin'.
Maybe you'll give 'em a cold.

339
00:24:53,315 --> 00:24:55,510
Hey, hey, hey,
knock it off!

340
00:24:55,584 --> 00:24:59,315
Against this team we should have
twice this many! Now let's run it up!

341
00:24:59,388 --> 00:25:03,984
Remember it's not worth winning
if you can't win big!

342
00:25:04,059 --> 00:25:06,027
All right!

343
00:25:08,597 --> 00:25:11,157
Guys! No! Come on,
let's talk about this!

344
00:25:11,233 --> 00:25:13,701
Be civilized!
Come on! Please!

345
00:25:19,742 --> 00:25:22,074
Oh no, guys!
Come on, not again! Please!

346
00:25:22,178 --> 00:25:26,342
Just take the goal.
Fine! I don't care!

347
00:25:26,415 --> 00:25:29,248
- I'm so embarrassed.
- We need a new goalie.

348
00:25:33,622 --> 00:25:35,556
All right!
Hey, knock it off!

349
00:25:35,624 --> 00:25:38,422
That was a lousy third period.
Anybody could beat these pansies.

350
00:25:38,527 --> 00:25:42,588
I want you guys
to stay hungry out there!

351
00:25:42,698 --> 00:25:45,565
All right, nice goin', Banks.
New Hawks record.

352
00:25:45,634 --> 00:25:48,569
- Okay, boys. Let's go.
- All right!

353
00:25:48,637 --> 00:25:51,367
Hey, Gordon! Nice game.

354
00:25:52,374 --> 00:25:54,433
I enjoyed it thoroughly.

355
00:25:55,644 --> 00:25:58,738
At least I can handle the puck!

356
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:04,943
Hey, shut up!
You guys stink!

357
00:26:05,054 --> 00:26:07,147
I thought we came
here to play hockey.

358
00:26:07,256 --> 00:26:10,123
You know, I knew we forgot something.

359
00:26:10,226 --> 00:26:13,059
Oh, you think it's funny?
You think losing is funny?

360
00:26:13,128 --> 00:26:15,596
Well, not at first,
but once you get the hang of it.

361
00:26:15,664 --> 00:26:17,757
We're the ones out there
gettin' our butts kicked.

362
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:21,291
Yeah, it's not like you coach us
or anything. At least we try.

363
00:26:21,403 --> 00:26:23,394
You didn't listen
to a word I said.

364
00:26:23,472 --> 00:26:25,440
I said, keep your heads up.
You put your heads down.

365
00:26:25,507 --> 00:26:27,441
I said, hustle.
You went slower!

366
00:26:27,509 --> 00:26:30,069
That was the sloppiest
playing I've ever seen.

367
00:26:30,145 --> 00:26:33,808
Why the hell don't you
just listen to me?

368
00:26:33,916 --> 00:26:37,784
Why the hell should we?

369
00:26:37,853 --> 00:26:41,152
I don't care.

370
00:26:41,257 --> 00:26:45,523
You want to lose, fine. You're the ones
who look like idiots out there.

371
00:26:52,434 --> 00:26:55,267
Great game!

372
00:26:55,337 --> 00:26:57,305
Hans?

373
00:27:10,886 --> 00:27:13,013
I don't believe it!
Who would throw these away?

374
00:27:13,122 --> 00:27:17,024
- First look's free, next five minutes costs a buck each.
- Fork it over.

375
00:27:17,126 --> 00:27:20,220
Forget it, Karp.
I can see this every day on MTV.

376
00:27:20,329 --> 00:27:24,789
This one's from Minneapolis.
Hey, Guy, look, it's your mom.

377
00:27:27,202 --> 00:27:29,363
- Let's give him a wedgie.
- Good idea,Jesse!

378
00:27:29,471 --> 00:27:32,463
I was just kidding, okay?

379
00:27:32,541 --> 00:27:34,907
Hey! Give that back!

380
00:27:36,512 --> 00:27:40,505
- Hi, girls.
- Does your mommy know you have that?

381
00:27:40,582 --> 00:27:43,244
Nah, she's busy with the mailman.

382
00:27:43,352 --> 00:27:44,842
That'll make great bathroom reading.

383
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,888
That's mine, you jerk!
I found it!

384
00:27:46,989 --> 00:27:48,889
You don't even know
what to do with it, wuss-breath.

385
00:27:48,991 --> 00:27:52,518
- You gonna let him call
you wuss-breath? - No!

386
00:27:52,594 --> 00:27:55,427
Hey! Hey!

387
00:27:55,531 --> 00:27:59,365
- Oh!
- Come on. Want some more?

388
00:27:59,435 --> 00:28:03,531
You guys want some more?
Come on!

389
00:28:03,605 --> 00:28:05,539
Yeah! You want some more?
Come on!

390
00:28:17,586 --> 00:28:20,054
Let's get out!
Move it!

391
00:28:20,122 --> 00:28:22,352
- Thanks a lot.
- All right, man.

392
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,524
One, two, three! Boom!

393
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:32,567
What are you laughing at,
cream cheese boy? Go!

394
00:28:32,634 --> 00:28:36,092
If we're gonna cheat,
we gotta make those falls look real.

395
00:28:36,205 --> 00:28:40,198
Keep it up! Whoa!
Score one for the spirit.

396
00:28:42,144 --> 00:28:44,772
Go at him! Go at him!
Good! Go at him!

397
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,781
Come on, get angry! Oh!

398
00:28:47,883 --> 00:28:50,147
Come on, make it look real.
Act hurt!

399
00:28:50,252 --> 00:28:52,311
I am hurt.

400
00:28:52,421 --> 00:28:54,787
Good, good.
Now say it again!

401
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:58,382
Take the fall!
Act hurt! Get indignant!

402
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:03,261
- One more time!
- Take the fall! Act hurt! Get indignant!

403
00:29:03,332 --> 00:29:07,098
Good! You guys are ready.

404
00:29:12,007 --> 00:29:15,943
Give me a break, ref! Open your eyes!
Did you see what he did to me?

405
00:29:16,011 --> 00:29:20,573
Goldberg, you don't take the fall
while they're shooting at you.

406
00:29:20,649 --> 00:29:23,447
Oh! Well, I guess you didn't
explain that very well, did ya?

407
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:26,147
- District Five!
- I throw myself on the ice -

408
00:29:26,255 --> 00:29:30,123
Cut the acting class.
One more dive, I forfeit to theJets!

409
00:29:30,192 --> 00:29:33,025
What? I'm insulted by that!

410
00:29:36,465 --> 00:29:39,332
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Quit it!

411
00:29:48,944 --> 00:29:51,606
Face-off! Let's go!

412
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,478
Charlie!

413
00:30:00,656 --> 00:30:04,148
That guy is twice your size. The next
time he gets you in a corner like that,

414
00:30:04,226 --> 00:30:07,457
I want you to grab your eye
like it's cut and then hit the ice!

415
00:30:07,529 --> 00:30:12,364
- Got it? Let's go.
- Let's go! Face-off!

416
00:30:12,468 --> 00:30:14,698
Okay, even 'em up, boys.
Here we go.

417
00:30:16,071 --> 00:30:18,130
Hey -

418
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:24,005
- Come on!
- That's it, Charlie.

419
00:30:26,482 --> 00:30:29,042
- That's it, Charlie!
- Come on!

420
00:30:32,254 --> 00:30:34,154
Damn it, Charlie!

421
00:30:34,223 --> 00:30:37,590
We can't even win when we cheat.

422
00:30:37,693 --> 00:30:41,026
- Stupid cake-eater tricks!
- That was embarrassing.

423
00:30:41,096 --> 00:30:45,362
Charlie! What the hell
is the matter with you?

424
00:30:45,434 --> 00:30:47,868
When I tell you to do something,
you do it! You got it?

425
00:30:49,605 --> 00:30:52,335
Look at me.

426
00:30:52,407 --> 00:30:56,537
- You got it?
- You can't make me cheat.

427
00:30:59,715 --> 00:31:04,379
Jesse, Terry, let's go.

428
00:31:04,453 --> 00:31:06,887
This is what I gave up
my overtime pay for?

429
00:31:06,955 --> 00:31:09,924
To see my kids takin' falls?

430
00:31:53,902 --> 00:31:56,462
Gordon.

431
00:31:56,572 --> 00:31:59,939
- How did you know?
- Through the back door at this time of night.

432
00:32:00,008 --> 00:32:03,341
Just like you used to.

433
00:32:03,445 --> 00:32:06,005
You'd spend hours
watching me do this.

434
00:32:06,114 --> 00:32:08,309
What do you think?

435
00:32:08,417 --> 00:32:10,317
Is this sharp enough? Ow!

436
00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:14,014
- Did you cut yourself?
- No.

437
00:32:14,122 --> 00:32:16,454
You always fell for that.

438
00:32:16,525 --> 00:32:19,983
- God, you're morbid, Hans.
- No, I'm Scandinavian.

439
00:32:20,095 --> 00:32:23,656
- It's nice to see you.
- Sure, sure, sure.

440
00:32:23,765 --> 00:32:26,757
You probably thought
I was dead.

441
00:32:26,835 --> 00:32:29,963
I saw you at the game the other night.
Why didn't you say anything?

442
00:32:30,038 --> 00:32:33,496
You were so busy
screaming at the kids.

443
00:32:33,609 --> 00:32:36,009
I didn't want
to spoil the moment.

444
00:32:46,321 --> 00:32:51,315
- Everything's the same.
- Well, the game hasn't changed.

445
00:32:51,393 --> 00:32:54,157
Why should my store?

446
00:32:54,229 --> 00:32:56,493
- Heard you became a doctor.
- Lawyer.

447
00:32:56,565 --> 00:32:59,500
Oh, that's too bad.
Enjoy that?

448
00:32:59,568 --> 00:33:02,230
Well, I hardly
ever lose a case.

449
00:33:02,337 --> 00:33:05,704
That is not what I asked.

450
00:33:05,807 --> 00:33:08,708
Hmm! I see you still have this up.

451
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:12,541
- Thanks very much.
- It is important to remember the past.

452
00:33:12,648 --> 00:33:15,208
I'd just as soon forget it.

453
00:33:15,317 --> 00:33:20,084
That was the worse time in my life.
My dad died that year.

454
00:33:20,188 --> 00:33:24,488
- The two are not related.
- No, but it felt like they were.

455
00:33:24,526 --> 00:33:28,394
I found this not long ago.

456
00:33:30,499 --> 00:33:32,660
He was proud of you.

457
00:33:32,734 --> 00:33:34,998
I miss him.

458
00:33:40,542 --> 00:33:44,410
You scored 198 goals
in that season, Gordon.

459
00:33:44,513 --> 00:33:46,879
It's a shame you quit. You -

460
00:33:46,948 --> 00:33:50,679
- Could have gone all the way. Yeah.
- No!

461
00:33:50,752 --> 00:33:53,846
You really loved to play.

462
00:33:53,922 --> 00:33:58,359
You remember? You remember...

463
00:33:58,427 --> 00:34:01,021
you used to play on the ponds
until after dark,

464
00:34:01,096 --> 00:34:03,963
until your father
called you back.

465
00:34:04,066 --> 00:34:06,534
You really flew
on that ice, Gordon.

466
00:34:06,601 --> 00:34:09,195
That's all I ever wanted to do.

467
00:34:09,271 --> 00:34:13,799
Then why did you stop? Reilly?

468
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:17,936
I saw what he did to you.
Reilly is an idiot.

469
00:34:18,046 --> 00:34:22,073
- The guy wins.
- It's not about winning. It never was.

470
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:27,554
Just show they how to play. Show them
how to have fun. Teach them to fly.

471
00:34:27,622 --> 00:34:32,582
That is what they'll remember long after
you've gone back to being a doctor.

472
00:34:32,661 --> 00:34:35,061
Lawyer.

473
00:34:35,163 --> 00:34:38,599
And long after they've stopped
buying skates from me.

474
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:42,103
Here... there you are.

475
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:44,468
Sharpened, laced, ready to go.

476
00:34:44,573 --> 00:34:47,406
- What's this?
- Your new skates.

477
00:34:47,476 --> 00:34:50,468
That is why you came here
tonight, isn't it?

478
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:55,846
- I figured nine and a half was your size.
- Actually, I'm a nine.

479
00:34:55,951 --> 00:35:00,752
Wear thick socks, Gordon.
Enjoy them.

480
00:36:02,017 --> 00:36:04,008
Here comes Bombay
on an end-to-end rush.

481
00:36:04,085 --> 00:36:07,577
Past the blue line, past centre.
He's not skating, he's flying!

482
00:36:07,689 --> 00:36:09,987
He fakes once,
he fakes twice.

483
00:36:10,058 --> 00:36:13,516
Fakes three times!
Shoots! Scores! Yes!

484
00:36:13,595 --> 00:36:16,894
Yes! Yes! Yes!
What a play!

485
00:36:16,998 --> 00:36:19,432
What a guy!
Gordon Bombay does it again!

486
00:36:19,534 --> 00:36:24,267
Great move, Gordy!
You faked him out of his pads.

487
00:36:24,372 --> 00:36:26,840
Come here, son.

488
00:36:26,908 --> 00:36:31,106
You look great out there. Come on,
let's go inside, get something to eat.

489
00:36:31,213 --> 00:36:34,512
A few more minutes?

490
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:37,347
Please?

491
00:36:37,419 --> 00:36:39,683
- Go on. Get outta here.
- Thanks.

492
00:37:16,591 --> 00:37:18,957
- Hi, uh - - Please,just go
away. Charlie doesn't want...

493
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,995
to be on the team any more, and neither
he nor I have anything to say to you.

494
00:37:22,097 --> 00:37:24,725
- Well, I have something to say to you.
- Oh, really?

495
00:37:24,799 --> 00:37:26,926
Door-to-door mistreatment now.

496
00:37:27,002 --> 00:37:29,562
Now the team can feel miserable
between games too, huh?

497
00:37:29,671 --> 00:37:34,802
I came to apologize to Charlie...
to both of you.

498
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:38,812
- What?
- Apologize.

499
00:37:38,914 --> 00:37:42,850
Well... you should.

500
00:37:44,152 --> 00:37:48,589
Charlie.
Somebody's here to see you.

501
00:37:50,992 --> 00:37:52,960
Hey, Charlie, how ya doin'?

502
00:37:54,829 --> 00:37:58,788
I was just, uh, walkin'
around thinkin' and, uh -

503
00:38:01,503 --> 00:38:04,802
Wanna give us a minute?

504
00:38:04,873 --> 00:38:08,639
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

505
00:38:14,883 --> 00:38:18,284
Listen, it was
very wrong of me...

506
00:38:18,353 --> 00:38:20,548
to ask you and
the other guys to cheat.

507
00:38:20,655 --> 00:38:24,386
I never should have said to you what I
said to you. I was angry. I was frustrated.

508
00:38:24,492 --> 00:38:28,952
It took a lot of guts for you to do
what you knew was right. I admire that.

509
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:33,967
And, uh, I just wanted
to tell you that, uh,

510
00:38:34,035 --> 00:38:36,833
that I'm -

511
00:38:36,905 --> 00:38:39,499
Oh, boy, this is difficult.

512
00:38:39,574 --> 00:38:41,838
- I'm -
- You're sorry.

513
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:45,869
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. All right?

514
00:38:45,981 --> 00:38:51,078
Tell your mom that hopefully it'll be
a lot more fun this time around.

515
00:38:51,186 --> 00:38:53,484
What do you say?

516
00:38:53,555 --> 00:38:56,547
Do you want to stay for dinner?

517
00:38:56,658 --> 00:38:59,422
- What?
- Charlie!

518
00:38:59,527 --> 00:39:03,486
Uh, no, I -
I can't. Uh -

519
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,334
Well, what are you havin'?

520
00:39:11,873 --> 00:39:15,274
Mr. Ducksworth,
there are two reasons I came by.

521
00:39:15,377 --> 00:39:17,937
First off, I want to let
you know things are going well.

522
00:39:18,046 --> 00:39:21,072
I'm learning a lot about teamwork,
fair play and all that junk.

523
00:39:21,182 --> 00:39:24,379
Good, good.
And the second thing?

524
00:39:24,452 --> 00:39:27,250
Well, sir,
fair play doesn't come cheap.

525
00:39:27,355 --> 00:39:29,915
These kids, my team,
have no money.

526
00:39:30,025 --> 00:39:33,392
They can't afford rink time,
safe equipment, proper uniforms,

527
00:39:33,461 --> 00:39:35,588
which makes it difficult
for them to compete.

528
00:39:35,697 --> 00:39:40,134
Now imagine, sir, being ten years old
and stepping out onto that ice...

529
00:39:40,235 --> 00:39:44,194
with old copies of the " Enquirer"
taped to your shins instead of pads.

530
00:39:44,272 --> 00:39:46,206
The point I'm trying to make, sir,

531
00:39:46,274 --> 00:39:49,038
is that you wouldn't be taken seriously
and neither are these kids.

532
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:52,944
So I thought maybe
the firm could help 'em out.

533
00:39:53,048 --> 00:39:54,743
How much are we talking about?

534
00:39:54,816 --> 00:39:58,115
- $15,000.
- No way.

535
00:39:58,219 --> 00:40:02,588
Wait a minute. Think of the goodwill.
We name the team after the firm.

536
00:40:02,657 --> 00:40:07,094
Suddenly, we're the good guys.
Ducksworth, Saver and Gross,

537
00:40:07,162 --> 00:40:11,394
the firm that gives back
to the community.

538
00:40:11,466 --> 00:40:13,798
Come on.
I'll get you your own jersey.

539
00:40:17,238 --> 00:40:19,502
~ Ooo,yeah ~

540
00:40:19,607 --> 00:40:22,940
~ Can you feel it baby
Ooo ~

541
00:40:23,011 --> 00:40:26,811
~I can too, Ooo ~

542
00:40:29,017 --> 00:40:31,417
~ Ooo ~

543
00:40:33,288 --> 00:40:36,155
~ Ooo, come on swing ~

544
00:40:36,257 --> 00:40:38,191
~ Come on swing ~

545
00:40:38,293 --> 00:40:40,318
~ Come on swing ~

546
00:40:40,428 --> 00:40:42,521
~ C-Come on swing
Ooo ~

547
00:40:44,699 --> 00:40:46,633
~ Ooo ~

548
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:52,137
~It's such a good vibration ~

549
00:40:52,207 --> 00:40:56,701
~It's such a sweet sensation ~

550
00:40:56,811 --> 00:41:00,611
~It's such a good vibration ~

551
00:41:00,682 --> 00:41:03,674
~It's such a sweet sensation ~

552
00:41:03,785 --> 00:41:06,015
Who is that kid?

553
00:41:06,121 --> 00:41:08,021
Thanks, Fulton.

554
00:41:08,123 --> 00:41:10,557
- Fulton Reed. He's in one of my classes.
- How come he's not on the team?

555
00:41:10,658 --> 00:41:13,456
He only plays football. Some preppie
school gave him a scholarship...

556
00:41:13,528 --> 00:41:15,496
as long as he doesn't play hockey.

557
00:41:15,563 --> 00:41:17,497
- They don't want him gettin' hurt.
- I heard it was colleges.

558
00:41:17,565 --> 00:41:19,658
He's been accepted to four of'em.

559
00:41:19,734 --> 00:41:23,500
- Yeah, but I heard he's got to repeat the sixth grade.
- Ah, shut up.

560
00:41:23,571 --> 00:41:27,302
Gordon Bombay?

561
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:29,809
Bombay was a Hawk.

562
00:41:29,878 --> 00:41:32,210
~... Good vibration ~

563
00:41:32,313 --> 00:41:35,714
~It's such a sweet sensation ~

564
00:41:35,817 --> 00:41:39,810
~Feel the vibration
It's such a good vibration ~~

565
00:41:41,222 --> 00:41:43,520
Dude, check 'em out, man.

566
00:41:43,591 --> 00:41:45,525
Holy cow.

567
00:41:45,593 --> 00:41:48,994
- They're pretty good skaters.
- Anybody know who they are?

568
00:41:49,063 --> 00:41:53,500
That's Tommy Duncan. He's in my science
class. That's his sister, Tammy.

569
00:41:53,568 --> 00:41:56,537
- Think they'd want to play hockey with us?
- Yeah!

570
00:41:56,604 --> 00:42:01,064
Go get dressed.
I'll do the negotiating.

571
00:42:02,744 --> 00:42:06,236
Just think of it
as figure skating... with a stick.

572
00:42:06,347 --> 00:42:09,714
You're gonna love it, Tammy.
Hey, atta boy, Tommy!

573
00:42:09,784 --> 00:42:13,447
Lookin' good, lookin' tough.
Give me five, show me you're alive!

574
00:42:13,555 --> 00:42:15,887
Mom isn't gonna
like this at all.

575
00:42:15,957 --> 00:42:19,017
So what? You want me to figure skate,
then you gotta play hockey.

576
00:42:19,093 --> 00:42:22,085
What do I know about hockey?

577
00:42:22,197 --> 00:42:24,688
More than you think.

578
00:42:24,766 --> 00:42:28,725
Back to basics! Skating!

579
00:42:28,803 --> 00:42:33,467
Go! Go! Side to side.
Shift your weight.

580
00:42:33,575 --> 00:42:37,602
Get comfortable on your edges.
That's good, that's good.

581
00:42:37,712 --> 00:42:40,237
Keep your balance, Karp.
Trust your edges.

582
00:42:40,315 --> 00:42:43,284
That's okay, Charlie.

583
00:42:46,154 --> 00:42:48,714
Soft hands.

584
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:53,591
You don't shoot the puck
to your teammate. You sail it to him.

585
00:42:53,661 --> 00:42:56,289
Karp, on your feet.

586
00:42:56,397 --> 00:43:01,596
- You send it.
- Oh! Gross!

587
00:43:01,669 --> 00:43:05,662
You don't stop the pass.
You accept it. Cradle it.

588
00:43:06,774 --> 00:43:08,833
- Oh!
- Again!

589
00:43:08,943 --> 00:43:11,138
Concentration, not strength.

590
00:43:11,246 --> 00:43:14,738
Like the Karate Kid, right?
"Wax on! Wax off!"

591
00:43:14,816 --> 00:43:17,580
Just shut up and try it, Averman!

592
00:43:17,652 --> 00:43:20,280
- You're such a jerk.
- Send it back, Averman.

593
00:43:20,355 --> 00:43:22,755
Good, Averman. Charlie.

594
00:43:24,759 --> 00:43:27,091
That's good. Good.
Now sail it back.

595
00:43:27,161 --> 00:43:31,495
Oh! Way to go!

596
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,126
Good, good.
Good, cradle it.

597
00:43:35,203 --> 00:43:37,535
Cradle it.
Soft hands, soft hands.

598
00:43:37,639 --> 00:43:39,937
Oh!

599
00:43:40,008 --> 00:43:42,272
Here it comes.
Nice and easy. Good.

600
00:43:42,343 --> 00:43:47,212
- I did it! I did it!
- All right.

601
00:43:47,315 --> 00:43:49,875
Nice drill, coach.
Really very cute.

602
00:43:49,984 --> 00:43:54,182
- But when are you gonna work with me in goal?
- Goldberg, do you trust me?

603
00:43:54,289 --> 00:43:58,316
My mother would not approve of this, coach.
She'd like me to live to be bar mitzvah'd.

604
00:43:58,393 --> 00:44:02,159
This is your bar mitzvah, Goldberg.
Today you will become a man.

605
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:05,495
Coach, I think you got the ceremonies
mixed up. It's more like a circumcision.

606
00:44:05,566 --> 00:44:08,626
Coach! Will you come back here?
What'd I ever do to you, man?

607
00:44:08,703 --> 00:44:12,298
District Five! Ready!

608
00:44:12,373 --> 00:44:15,001
Oh, man, I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die.

609
00:44:15,076 --> 00:44:17,670
- Aim!
- Nice knowin' ya, Goldie.

610
00:44:17,745 --> 00:44:19,872
- Oh, please! No!
- Fire!

611
00:44:24,552 --> 00:44:27,646
I wanna go home!

612
00:44:33,394 --> 00:44:35,692
This doesn't hurt!

613
00:44:35,763 --> 00:44:38,163
You wimps!
Give me your best shot!

614
00:44:38,232 --> 00:44:40,723
Oh! Come on!
That's good!

615
00:44:40,835 --> 00:44:44,430
Hex goal! Goalie boot save!
Whoa! Nice shot, man!

616
00:44:44,539 --> 00:44:47,406
I'm a dog! I'm a crazed dog!
Come on!

617
00:44:47,508 --> 00:44:51,911
Goldberg! Goldberg!

618
00:44:52,013 --> 00:44:55,915
I am Goldberg!
The goalie!

619
00:44:57,852 --> 00:45:01,288
Good! Good!
All right, Charlie!

620
00:45:01,389 --> 00:45:04,290
Good hustle! Conway, way to go.
All right, Karp!

621
00:45:04,392 --> 00:45:06,519
- You guys hungry? Tired?
- Yeah!

622
00:45:06,594 --> 00:45:10,394
- Do you ache? Are you pumped up?
- Yeah!

623
00:45:10,465 --> 00:45:14,731
Good! That was a hell of a practise.
Be proud of yourself.

624
00:45:17,705 --> 00:45:21,903
Hey, guys! Excuse me, guys!
You gotta untie me now!

625
00:45:21,976 --> 00:45:25,742
Ha-ha! Good joke.
Very funny. I like it.

626
00:45:25,813 --> 00:45:28,805
No joke, come on, guys.
Hey, coach!

627
00:45:28,916 --> 00:45:31,407
Coach, come on, don't leave me
hangin' like this!

628
00:45:31,486 --> 00:45:33,750
Coach, don't make me
come after you, coach.

629
00:45:47,802 --> 00:45:51,431
- Here you go.
- Thanks. Thanks for the ride.

630
00:45:51,506 --> 00:45:54,566
You did real well in
practise today, Charlie.

631
00:45:54,642 --> 00:45:57,770
Let me ask you something.
What happened to your dad?

632
00:45:59,847 --> 00:46:05,410
Mom and I left him. I don't really
remember, but that's what she says.

633
00:46:05,486 --> 00:46:09,320
You know, when I was a boy,
I had to take care of my mother too.

634
00:46:09,424 --> 00:46:11,654
Really?
What happened to your dad?

635
00:46:11,759 --> 00:46:15,160
He passed away.

636
00:46:16,798 --> 00:46:20,598
You do a good job
takin' care of your mom.

637
00:46:20,668 --> 00:46:22,761
- Thanks.
- Keep it up, all right?

638
00:46:22,837 --> 00:46:26,466
- Okay. We'll see ya.
- Okay. Hey, coach.

639
00:46:26,541 --> 00:46:28,771
- What's that?
- Huh?

640
00:46:28,843 --> 00:46:30,936
- Oh!
- Victory!

641
00:46:31,012 --> 00:46:35,005
You've just entered the tickling zone!

642
00:46:41,355 --> 00:46:44,324
So I'm right in the middle of my
cross-examination and I say to the guy,

643
00:46:44,392 --> 00:46:48,158
I usually defend heels like you,
you scuzzy, mole-faced rat.

644
00:46:48,229 --> 00:46:50,493
That's a good one, sir.

645
00:46:50,565 --> 00:46:52,499
Whoa!

646
00:47:00,408 --> 00:47:04,469
Hey! Hey! Hold it!

647
00:47:05,913 --> 00:47:09,815
Hold it!

648
00:47:09,884 --> 00:47:12,546
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

649
00:47:12,653 --> 00:47:14,848
Look, it was an accident,
all right?

650
00:47:14,922 --> 00:47:17,516
Never mind the window.
Where'd you learn to shoot like that?

651
00:47:17,592 --> 00:47:19,685
I didn't learn.
I just do it.

652
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,024
Do it again.

653
00:47:32,773 --> 00:47:34,832
Yargh!

654
00:47:37,778 --> 00:47:41,214
Well, you're great at breaking windows.
Do you ever hit the goal?

655
00:47:41,282 --> 00:47:44,581
Yeah. Well, one out of five.

656
00:47:44,685 --> 00:47:47,950
Fulton, is it true what they say?

657
00:47:48,055 --> 00:47:50,216
About the scholarships and how
they won't let you play hockey?

658
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:52,384
People talk.
It don't mean nothin'.

659
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:55,088
- Why don't you play for us?
- I can't.

660
00:47:55,196 --> 00:47:57,596
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I can't.

661
00:47:57,698 --> 00:48:02,032
- You afraid?
- No, I mean I can't, you moron. I don't know how to skate.

662
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:07,901
Whoa!

663
00:48:07,975 --> 00:48:09,943
Is that all that's stoppin' ya?

664
00:48:20,321 --> 00:48:23,290
~I ride the top of the line
I can't settle for less ~

665
00:48:23,391 --> 00:48:25,382
Push, Fulton, push.
Keep your knees bent.

666
00:48:25,459 --> 00:48:28,087
Side to side, good!
Follow me.

667
00:48:33,801 --> 00:48:36,634
Aaah!

668
00:48:37,738 --> 00:48:40,002
Watch it!
Get out of the way!

669
00:48:42,343 --> 00:48:44,641
Sorry!

670
00:48:44,745 --> 00:48:46,940
~ This is all we got baby
It's got to be enough ~

671
00:48:47,014 --> 00:48:49,278
~I'd like to try to quit
But I don't know how ~

672
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:53,184
~I needed it then and baby
I need it right now ~

673
00:48:53,287 --> 00:48:55,448
Come on, Fulton.
Let's go!

674
00:48:55,523 --> 00:48:58,458
- ~I gotta keep movin' 'til I'm satisfied ~
- Hey!

675
00:48:58,526 --> 00:49:02,257
~ Come on, Come on
It's gonna be all right ~~

676
00:49:05,032 --> 00:49:08,126
The Ducks?
We're the Ducks?

677
00:49:08,202 --> 00:49:10,670
Man, what brain-dead jerk
came up with that name?

678
00:49:10,771 --> 00:49:15,834
As a matter of fact, I did. But I didn't
have a choice. We're being sponsored.

679
00:49:15,943 --> 00:49:19,435
By who? Donald and Daisy?

680
00:49:19,513 --> 00:49:23,210
Hey, you don't wanna be Ducks? You'd
rather be District Five? Some stupid number?

681
00:49:23,317 --> 00:49:26,480
Better than some stupid animal.

682
00:49:26,554 --> 00:49:30,820
I'll have you know, Peter,
that the Duck is one of the most noble,

683
00:49:30,891 --> 00:49:33,519
agile and intelligent creatures
of the animal kingdom.

684
00:49:33,628 --> 00:49:36,188
- But they're wimpy.
- They don't even have teeth.

685
00:49:36,297 --> 00:49:39,232
Neither do hockey players.

686
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:42,530
Have you guys ever seen a flock
of ducks flying in perfect formation?

687
00:49:42,637 --> 00:49:46,971
It's beautiful. Pretty awesome
the way they all stick together.

688
00:49:47,041 --> 00:49:50,306
Ducks never say die.
Ever seen a duck fight?

689
00:49:50,378 --> 00:49:55,008
No way. Why?
Because the other animals are afraid.

690
00:49:55,082 --> 00:49:58,142
They know that
if they mess with one duck,

691
00:49:58,219 --> 00:50:01,677
they gotta deal
with the whole flock.

692
00:50:03,724 --> 00:50:05,919
Oh, man!

693
00:50:06,027 --> 00:50:08,052
I'm proud to be a duck.

694
00:50:08,162 --> 00:50:11,529
And I'd be proud to fly
with any one of you.

695
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:14,159
So how about it?
Who's a Duck?

696
00:50:19,507 --> 00:50:24,206
I'll be a Duck.

697
00:50:24,278 --> 00:50:28,578
Yeah. Me too.

698
00:50:34,455 --> 00:50:37,686
Anybody see Goldberg?
All right!

699
00:50:40,561 --> 00:50:44,122
Now we're the Ducks!

700
00:50:44,231 --> 00:50:46,756
The Mighty Ducks!

701
00:50:46,867 --> 00:50:49,062
- What are we?
- The Ducks!

702
00:50:55,142 --> 00:50:57,235
What the hell are they doing?

703
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:02,645
Every time you get the puck,
you're the quarterback.

704
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:06,481
Make eye contact with the receiver.
Talk to him, let him know it's comin'.

705
00:51:06,587 --> 00:51:10,284
Come on, guys. This isn't a library.
Talk to each other.

706
00:51:10,391 --> 00:51:12,621
What a weird-ass team.

707
00:51:12,727 --> 00:51:14,888
How you doin'?

708
00:51:14,962 --> 00:51:16,930
- You ready?
- I think so.

709
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,925
Okay, Fulton.
Shoot your heart out.

710
00:51:31,178 --> 00:51:33,578
My God!

711
00:51:44,024 --> 00:51:46,117
Wow!

712
00:51:53,768 --> 00:51:56,601
One out of five.

713
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:02,639
All right,
Let's forget the past.

714
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:06,373
We lost a few games, tough!
That was District Five.

715
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,005
- Now we're the Ducks.
- Yeah.

716
00:52:09,116 --> 00:52:13,450
- And the Ducks... are undefeated.
- All right! Yeah!

717
00:52:13,521 --> 00:52:15,853
Quack, quack.

718
00:52:15,956 --> 00:52:18,982
- Quack. Quack.
- Quack! Quack!

719
00:52:19,059 --> 00:52:22,495
Quack! Quack!
Quack! Quack!

720
00:52:22,563 --> 00:52:26,294
Quack! Quack!

721
00:52:26,367 --> 00:52:29,393
Go... Ducks!

722
00:52:29,503 --> 00:52:31,994
What the hell was that?

723
00:52:35,976 --> 00:52:38,843
Let's go, Ducks! Defence! Defence!

724
00:52:43,818 --> 00:52:46,218
Dig it outta there!

725
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:50,689
Let's go! Let's go! Yeah!

726
00:52:50,758 --> 00:52:54,489
Let's go, Ducks!

727
00:52:54,562 --> 00:52:57,360
Throw it! Throw it!
To the crease!

728
00:53:08,576 --> 00:53:12,034
Yes! The Oreo line!

729
00:53:12,112 --> 00:53:14,945
That's my boy!

730
00:53:21,922 --> 00:53:25,050
Defence, Karp!
Defence! Come on.

731
00:53:38,806 --> 00:53:41,900
I don't wanna go
to school today, Mom.

732
00:53:41,976 --> 00:53:44,137
- How many fingers am I holdin' up?
- He wouldn't know.

733
00:53:44,245 --> 00:53:46,770
Shut up, Peter.
Karp, are you okay?

734
00:53:46,881 --> 00:53:51,443
- Look at this. - The Karp-ster
used his head to stop the puck.

735
00:53:51,552 --> 00:53:55,386
Let's get you off the ice.
Come on.

736
00:53:58,592 --> 00:54:02,824
Get him on the bench, Charlie.

737
00:54:04,832 --> 00:54:07,392
Okay, Ducks,
we still got a chance here.

738
00:54:07,468 --> 00:54:10,403
Connie, Terry,Jesse, Guy,
time for the secret weapon.

739
00:54:10,471 --> 00:54:14,271
Okay, Fulton.
Remember,just like we talked about.

740
00:54:15,609 --> 00:54:17,577
Come on, guys.
Let's do it.

741
00:54:24,618 --> 00:54:27,280
Oh, no.

742
00:54:27,354 --> 00:54:30,812
- Go! Get the face-off!
- Line up, boys, let's go.

743
00:54:35,863 --> 00:54:38,354
That's it.

744
00:54:38,465 --> 00:54:40,365
Aaah!

745
00:54:40,467 --> 00:54:43,027
Whoa!

746
00:54:55,883 --> 00:54:58,374
Whoo! Yeah!

747
00:55:09,296 --> 00:55:12,288
That tie of yours might be what you need
to make the play-offs.

748
00:55:12,366 --> 00:55:14,459
- The ducks have a shot
at the play-offs? - Sure.

749
00:55:14,535 --> 00:55:17,902
Everyone but the last two teams
are in, remember?

750
00:55:18,005 --> 00:55:20,974
Panthers got the measles
and they forfeited the season.

751
00:55:21,041 --> 00:55:24,568
So,you beat the Huskies
and you'll make the play-offs.

752
00:55:24,678 --> 00:55:28,136
- Well, we might have to play the Hawks.
- So?

753
00:55:28,215 --> 00:55:31,241
So they're a tough team.
Nothing's changed since I played.

754
00:55:31,352 --> 00:55:33,343
Actually, one little thing
has changed.

755
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:36,321
You wouldn't even be a Hawk now.

756
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:40,918
They redrew the district
lines last year.

757
00:55:41,028 --> 00:55:43,360
The lake is not
the boundary any more.

758
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:46,422
You see? You'd be a Duck.

759
00:55:46,533 --> 00:55:50,492
I'd be a Duck.

760
00:55:53,007 --> 00:55:54,998
Excuse me. Coach Reilly?

761
00:55:55,075 --> 00:55:57,009
- Yeah?
- I'm afraid there's a bit of a problem.

762
00:55:57,077 --> 00:56:00,205
- What's that?
- One of your players is ineligible.

763
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:03,909
Banks! Over here!

764
00:56:04,018 --> 00:56:06,009
- This is a joke, right?
- I'm afraid it's no joke.

765
00:56:06,086 --> 00:56:09,112
- Problem?
- No,just a mistake.

766
00:56:09,223 --> 00:56:13,887
Are you this boy's father? 450 North
Hennipen, is that your address?

767
00:56:13,961 --> 00:56:16,020
- Yes.
- I'm afraid there's no mistake.

768
00:56:16,096 --> 00:56:19,361
- This boy is playing for the wrong team.
- What?

769
00:56:19,433 --> 00:56:22,197
According to league rules, Adam Banks
should be playing for District Five.

770
00:56:22,269 --> 00:56:27,639
- My son is a Hawk, not a Duck.
- Is this your doing, Gordon?

771
00:56:27,741 --> 00:56:30,141
I'll expect to see him
at our next game.

772
00:56:30,244 --> 00:56:33,042
- We'll have a uniform waiting for you.
- No way.

773
00:56:33,113 --> 00:56:36,605
My son would rather not play
than play for your team.

774
00:56:36,717 --> 00:56:38,878
Fine, if that's the way
you want it. But remember,

775
00:56:38,952 --> 00:56:42,911
if Adam plays for the Hawks, you'll forfeit
every game for the rest of the season.

776
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:46,153
Boy, I'd hate to see that.

777
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:50,162
Look, I'm sorry this had to happen,
but you can see on the map.

778
00:56:52,299 --> 00:56:55,132
Gordon? Hey, Bombay!

779
00:56:55,235 --> 00:56:58,466
You stop when
I'm talking to you, son!

780
00:56:58,572 --> 00:57:01,063
What's the idea here?
You trying to sabotage me or what?

781
00:57:01,141 --> 00:57:04,133
The law's a bitch when it
works against you, isn't it,Jack?

782
00:57:04,244 --> 00:57:06,678
You got a whole team of Banks's.
One kid isn't gonna make a difference.

783
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:10,841
Even with Banks, what do you think you're
gonna prove, you and that bunch of losers?

784
00:57:10,951 --> 00:57:13,249
That's right, coach.
They are losers.

785
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:17,086
We hate losers, don't we?
They don't even deserve to live.

786
00:57:17,157 --> 00:57:22,618
Maybe Banks won't make a difference,
but at least we're playing by the rules.

787
00:57:22,696 --> 00:57:27,360
Why'd you turn against me,
Gordon? For six years...

788
00:57:27,468 --> 00:57:30,266
I taught ya how to skate,
I taught ya how to score.

789
00:57:30,337 --> 00:57:32,601
I taught ya how
to go for the "W."

790
00:57:32,673 --> 00:57:35,301
You could have been
one of the greats.

791
00:57:35,375 --> 00:57:38,276
And now look at yourself.

792
00:57:38,345 --> 00:57:42,179
You're not even a has-been.
You're a never-was.

793
00:57:50,491 --> 00:57:54,552
Going to the play-offs! Whoo!

794
00:57:54,661 --> 00:57:58,028
One win!

795
00:57:58,132 --> 00:58:01,898
Hey, why aren't you guys in uniform?
We got warm-ups in half an hour.

796
00:58:02,002 --> 00:58:06,496
All right, everyone, listen up.
I got some good news.

797
00:58:06,573 --> 00:58:09,041
We're getting a new player,
Adam Banks.

798
00:58:09,143 --> 00:58:11,703
What?

799
00:58:11,812 --> 00:58:13,746
- He's a Hawk.
- He's a good player.

800
00:58:13,847 --> 00:58:16,645
- Yuck.
- Everybody hates him.

801
00:58:16,717 --> 00:58:19,982
- We don't need him.
- I'm the coach. I say we do need him.

802
00:58:20,053 --> 00:58:22,544
- If we make it to the play-offs,
he could be a big help. - If?

803
00:58:22,656 --> 00:58:24,749
All of a sudden you don't
think we're good enough.

804
00:58:24,858 --> 00:58:27,827
No, he thinks we're losers.
That's what he told Reilly.

805
00:58:27,895 --> 00:58:31,729
- What?
- We heard what you said.

806
00:58:31,832 --> 00:58:34,926
You said we were losers,
we didn't deserve to live.

807
00:58:35,035 --> 00:58:39,836
- That's not what I meant.
- I saw that picture of you missing that goal.

808
00:58:39,907 --> 00:58:44,105
You were a Hawk, weren't you? Guess
you guys stick together to the end.

809
00:58:44,211 --> 00:58:48,011
You know what?
I don't need your stinkin'equipment.

810
00:58:48,081 --> 00:58:52,347
- See you around.
- Peter, come back here.

811
00:58:52,419 --> 00:58:55,616
- I'm talkin' to you, son!
- Forget it, cake-eater.

812
00:58:55,722 --> 00:59:00,216
If you wanna play, play with yourself.
Come on, Terry.

813
00:59:03,363 --> 00:59:05,524
Where do you guys
think you're goin'?

814
00:59:08,302 --> 00:59:12,796
I don't believe this.

815
00:59:12,906 --> 00:59:17,138
All right, I'm goin' up to the bench
because that's where I'm supposed to be.

816
00:59:17,244 --> 00:59:21,078
Anyone who wants to join me
can join me. Anyone who doesn't -

817
00:59:21,148 --> 00:59:24,879
Well -

818
00:59:39,067 --> 00:59:40,967
Ten minutes to game time, coach.

819
00:59:41,069 --> 00:59:42,969
Yeah, yeah, they'll
be out in a minute.

820
00:59:43,071 --> 00:59:46,097
They're, you know, working
themselves into a frenzy.

821
00:59:58,286 --> 01:00:00,720
Not much of a frenzy.

822
01:00:03,825 --> 01:00:06,419
We forfeit.

823
01:00:06,528 --> 01:00:08,962
Ducks forfeit. Flames, you win.

824
01:00:15,036 --> 01:00:17,470
Hey. Can I sit?

825
01:00:17,539 --> 01:00:19,473
Sure.

826
01:00:21,709 --> 01:00:23,643
You talk to the guys?

827
01:00:23,711 --> 01:00:27,147
I tried. They think I'm a traitor
for even showing up.

828
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:29,910
I guess they
really hate me, huh?

829
01:00:30,018 --> 01:00:33,044
Is it true you were
really a Hawk?

830
01:00:34,389 --> 01:00:36,323
Yeah.

831
01:00:36,391 --> 01:00:40,521
Peter said you blew
a really big game once.

832
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:42,529
Yeah, well, Peter's right.

833
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:44,827
It was the last game
of the state finals.

834
01:00:44,899 --> 01:00:47,493
We were tied 2-2
in the end of the third period.

835
01:00:47,569 --> 01:00:49,503
I get a penalty shot.

836
01:00:49,571 --> 01:00:53,507
I go in, I triple deke.
I fake the goalie right out of his pads.

837
01:00:53,575 --> 01:00:55,509
The puck's headed in,
and then...

838
01:00:55,577 --> 01:00:58,341
Clang! Hits the post.

839
01:00:58,413 --> 01:01:00,847
We lost in overtime.

840
01:01:00,915 --> 01:01:04,009
A quarter of an inch this way
and it would have gone in.

841
01:01:04,085 --> 01:01:06,053
A quarter of an inch, Charlie.

842
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:10,523
Yeah, but a quarter inch the other way
and you'd have missed completely.

843
01:01:10,592 --> 01:01:12,526
I never thought of it that way.

844
01:01:12,594 --> 01:01:15,062
At least you got to play
in a championship game.

845
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:19,293
- That must've been so cool.
- Hey. Can I get you a cup of coffee?

846
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,698
I'd love one.

847
01:01:24,105 --> 01:01:27,541
You know, she has many fine qualities
that men find attractive.

848
01:01:27,609 --> 01:01:30,442
I know that, Charlie.
That fact hasn't escaped me.

849
01:01:30,545 --> 01:01:33,139
So, what kind of guys
does she usually date?

850
01:01:33,247 --> 01:01:35,647
Jerks. I mean,
most of them like her,

851
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:37,775
but as soon as they
catch a glimpse of me -

852
01:01:37,885 --> 01:01:41,082
Pow! Warp speed!
They are gone!

853
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:43,385
- Don't take it personally, Charlie.
- Oh, I wouldn't even care...

854
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:45,425
except it's not fair to my mom.

855
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:48,155
She deserves somebody nice.

856
01:01:48,262 --> 01:01:51,254
Are you gonna come over
for dinner again?

857
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:53,266
I don't know, Charlie.

858
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:56,269
I'm not sure
it's such a good idea.

859
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:58,965
See, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

860
01:01:59,073 --> 01:02:03,476
I, um, talked
toJesse and Terry's dad,

861
01:02:03,578 --> 01:02:06,604
and he's gonna take over
coaching for the rest of the year.

862
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:09,775
- You're quitting?
- I'm stepping aside to keep the team together.

863
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:11,785
The guys can't play for
somebody they don't trust.

864
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,946
I trust you.
The other guys do too.

865
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:16,115
They just don't know it.
Talk to 'em.

866
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:19,182
- I've done all I can.
- No, you haven't.

867
01:02:19,293 --> 01:02:22,456
You gotta make 'em understand.
You can't walk out on the Ducks.

868
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,623
- We're your team.
- No, you're not.

869
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:27,634
We are too! We weren't even
the Ducks until you came along.

870
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:30,796
You made us and now
you're stuck with us.

871
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:32,806
Charlie.

872
01:02:36,344 --> 01:02:39,472
That's right.
The red is oxygen.

873
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:42,277
Now what are the blue balls?

874
01:02:44,352 --> 01:02:46,513
- Tommy?
- Hydrogen?

875
01:02:46,621 --> 01:02:48,816
Is correct.
Now put them together...

876
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:53,020
and you have a molecule
that makes up 96% of your body.

877
01:02:53,127 --> 01:02:55,322
- What is it?
- Pizza?

878
01:02:57,532 --> 01:03:01,468
It's the principal. I'll be right back.

879
01:03:01,536 --> 01:03:06,371
Work on H2 CO3.
It's a goody.

880
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:12,178
- How'd the forfeit go, Spaz-way?
- Yeah, did you score?

881
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:14,544
Leave me alone, guys.
I don't want to talk about the team.

882
01:03:14,649 --> 01:03:16,514
Oh, yeah, sure.
Coach's pet.

883
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:18,848
Everybody knows
he likes you best.

884
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,684
- Likes his mom, you mean.
- Take it back, Karp!

885
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:23,690
Take it back now!

886
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:25,658
- Leave him alone.
- You have no right shoving Karp.

887
01:03:25,727 --> 01:03:27,854
- Don't push me.
- Don't push her, she's a girl!

888
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:30,022
- Lay off!
- Don't shove, Peter.

889
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:34,534
Atoms away!

890
01:03:41,743 --> 01:03:43,836
My atoms!

891
01:03:43,911 --> 01:03:45,936
You! Sit!

892
01:03:47,115 --> 01:03:50,414
Sit now!

893
01:03:50,518 --> 01:03:53,214
In your seats now!

894
01:04:00,194 --> 01:04:02,560
I have never in my life -

895
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:05,895
What have you got to say
for yourselves?

896
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:07,901
Quack.

897
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:12,303
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack!

898
01:04:12,573 --> 01:04:15,201
Thanks for coming by
on such short notice, Gordon.

899
01:04:15,276 --> 01:04:17,210
By the way, your court
release came through.

900
01:04:17,278 --> 01:04:20,213
- Congratulations. Your community service is over.
- You're kidding.

901
01:04:20,281 --> 01:04:22,715
So you wanted to talk
about my coming back to work then?

902
01:04:22,784 --> 01:04:24,877
- Well, actually -
- Oh, you got your jersey. Great!

903
01:04:24,952 --> 01:04:28,945
A lot's been happening.
The Ducks might even make the play-offs.

904
01:04:29,056 --> 01:04:33,288
Gordon, you know
Coach Reilly and Mr. Banks.

905
01:04:33,394 --> 01:04:35,294
Sir, they're the bad guys.

906
01:04:35,396 --> 01:04:38,126
No, actually, Phil is
one of my oldest friends.

907
01:04:38,232 --> 01:04:42,464
Gerald was kind enough to get us all together
here to try to work out this little problem.

908
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:45,300
You see, my son Adam
wants to play for the Hawks.

909
01:04:45,406 --> 01:04:47,601
His older brother was a Hawk.

910
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:51,076
All of his little friends are Hawks.
That's where he belongs.

911
01:04:51,145 --> 01:04:54,979
It's a tradition. You understand that,
Gordon. You played.

912
01:04:55,082 --> 01:04:57,642
But the league's
already ruled on it.

913
01:04:57,752 --> 01:05:00,744
We've talked to the league,
and we worked out a little deal.

914
01:05:00,822 --> 01:05:03,950
- You guys cut a deal with the Pee Wee Hockey League?
- Yes, we did.

915
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:08,155
The long and short of it is that Adam stays
on the Hawks for the rest of the season.

916
01:05:08,262 --> 01:05:10,992
And then next year,
they redraft the lines.

917
01:05:11,098 --> 01:05:13,828
- Correctly.
- The league did make one condition.

918
01:05:13,935 --> 01:05:15,835
What's that?

919
01:05:15,937 --> 01:05:18,838
That you withdraw your protest.

920
01:05:20,942 --> 01:05:23,843
- That's great.
- Good, good.

921
01:05:23,945 --> 01:05:25,845
Well, that's settled then.

922
01:05:25,947 --> 01:05:28,347
No, sir, you don't understand.

923
01:05:28,449 --> 01:05:30,644
I can't withdraw my protest.

924
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:33,312
- What?
- Mr. Ducksworth,

925
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:35,821
you wanted me to learn
about fair play...

926
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:38,825
and how to be part
of a team...

927
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:41,828
and I may not have
learned everything yet,

928
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:44,831
but I remember something
my father said to me.

929
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:47,834
A team isn't a bunch
of kids out to win.

930
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:51,167
A team is something
you belong to,

931
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:54,174
something you feel,

932
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:57,177
something you have to earn.

933
01:05:57,245 --> 01:06:00,339
And I'm not gonna
let those kids down.

934
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:14,353
Gordon, I'm going
to make this simple.

935
01:06:14,428 --> 01:06:20,196
Are you prepared to lose your job
over some kids? Some game?

936
01:06:20,268 --> 01:06:23,533
Let me ask you, sir.

937
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:28,041
Are you prepared to fire me
over some kids? Some game?

938
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:32,842
Collect your personal
belongings, Gordon.

939
01:06:35,182 --> 01:06:38,447
Yes, sir, Mr. Ducksworth!

940
01:06:38,552 --> 01:06:40,452
Thank you very much,
Mr. Ducksworth!

941
01:06:40,554 --> 01:06:43,523
Quack, quack, quack, quack,
quack, Mr. Ducksworth!

942
01:06:43,591 --> 01:06:47,391
- Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.
- Gordon, stop quacking.

943
01:06:51,232 --> 01:06:55,896
You may have paid for this jersey, sir,
but you didn't earn it.

944
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:59,428
I'll see you in the play-offs.

945
01:07:05,246 --> 01:07:09,046
- Excuse me. There are some students here that I'd like to see.
- Who are you?

946
01:07:09,116 --> 01:07:11,050
I'm their hockey coach.

947
01:07:11,118 --> 01:07:15,487
If you could tell me where
I can find each of them, please.

948
01:07:15,589 --> 01:07:18,057
They're in room 223.

949
01:07:18,125 --> 01:07:22,084
- All of them?
- All of them.

950
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:32,268
"I will not quack
at the principal. "

951
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:34,774
- What do you want?
- I want to talk to you guys.

952
01:07:34,842 --> 01:07:37,777
- People.
- People, right.

953
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:39,779
Sit down, please.
All of you.

954
01:07:42,416 --> 01:07:44,407
Okay, don't sit down.

955
01:07:44,485 --> 01:07:46,783
Look, what's done is done.

956
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:49,448
I want to be your coach again.

957
01:07:49,523 --> 01:07:51,991
You're gonna coach
a bunch of losers?

958
01:07:52,093 --> 01:07:54,789
- No, I want to coach the Ducks.
- What about the things you said?

959
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:57,160
You said we didn't
deserve to live.

960
01:07:57,264 --> 01:08:00,961
Karp, I was being sarcastic.
Do you know what that means?

961
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:04,129
- No.
- Okay, then you do.

962
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:06,799
I didn't mean those things
the way they sounded.

963
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:09,672
You guys know what it's like
to be misunderstood, right?

964
01:08:09,777 --> 01:08:12,473
- Yeah, of course. We're kids.
- So...

965
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:16,004
Can you forgive me?
Can I be your coach again?

966
01:08:16,117 --> 01:08:19,644
- What about Banks?
- He can be on the team if he wants.

967
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,517
He should have been
with us all year.

968
01:08:21,622 --> 01:08:25,820
It's you guys who were cheated.
Let's forget all that crap!

969
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:29,693
- We're a team, right?
- Yeah.

970
01:08:29,797 --> 01:08:34,200
I made you guys,
and I'm sticking with you.

971
01:08:34,301 --> 01:08:38,465
So, what's it gonna be?

972
01:08:38,539 --> 01:08:41,804
We can play tomorrow night and still
have a shot at the play-offs...

973
01:08:41,876 --> 01:08:47,007
or we can forfeit again
and the season's over.

974
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:49,208
Peter, what do you say?

975
01:08:49,316 --> 01:08:52,217
Well...

976
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:56,050
I guess it would help
if we practised first.

977
01:08:56,157 --> 01:08:59,058
All right. Let me see if I can
get you out of detention.

978
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,355
- Yes.
- Take that.

979
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:03,522
You really quacked
at the principal?

980
01:09:03,597 --> 01:09:05,827
Yeah.

981
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:08,528
Are we Ducks, or what?

982
01:09:08,602 --> 01:09:10,365
Yeah!

983
01:09:12,573 --> 01:09:14,507
Look at your mother.

984
01:09:14,575 --> 01:09:17,510
Let's see how it is
in ten minutes.

985
01:09:17,578 --> 01:09:19,512
I'm gonna kill you!

986
01:09:31,926 --> 01:09:34,861
Hey. Wasn't sure
if you'd show up.

987
01:09:34,929 --> 01:09:36,863
Yeah, whatever.

988
01:09:36,931 --> 01:09:39,365
- I just want to play hockey.
- Good.

989
01:09:39,433 --> 01:09:42,527
Ducks, you all know Adam Banks.

990
01:09:42,603 --> 01:09:44,867
On behalf of the Ducks,
I'd like to say welcome.

991
01:09:44,939 --> 01:09:47,772
Cake-eater.

992
01:09:47,875 --> 01:09:51,242
Ooh, theJess-man, dissin'the new guy!
TheJess-ster!

993
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:53,542
Shut up, Averman!

994
01:09:53,614 --> 01:09:56,378
It's just a joke.

995
01:09:56,450 --> 01:10:02,047
Puttin' on a Ducks jersey
doesn't mean you're a real Duck.

996
01:10:27,014 --> 01:10:31,110
- They're a good group once you get to know 'em.
- I bet.

997
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:34,780
Well, suit up.
I'll see you on the ice.

998
01:10:48,602 --> 01:10:50,502
On your left!

999
01:10:52,606 --> 01:10:54,301
Over here!

1000
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:56,639
I'm open!

1001
01:10:56,710 --> 01:11:00,168
Come on, right here!
Up front!

1002
01:11:01,949 --> 01:11:04,213
- Up front!
- Pass it to Banks!

1003
01:11:05,786 --> 01:11:07,811
Come on!
Do somethin' with it!

1004
01:11:10,624 --> 01:11:12,524
Yeah! All right!

1005
01:11:14,361 --> 01:11:17,194
Way to go, Banks!

1006
01:11:17,298 --> 01:11:19,323
All right!
Score another one for the Ducks!

1007
01:11:24,305 --> 01:11:26,705
Goldberg, you're gonna
sit this one out.

1008
01:11:26,807 --> 01:11:29,833
What? You're pulling
the goalie when we're tied?

1009
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:31,844
Listen, listen, listen!

1010
01:11:31,912 --> 01:11:34,847
A tie isn't gonna help us.
We need the win.

1011
01:11:34,915 --> 01:11:37,816
Okay, Fulton,
you're our extra man.

1012
01:11:37,885 --> 01:11:40,979
Everybody, get the puck to Fulton.
That's your job.

1013
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:43,853
- We pulling the Statue of Liberty play?
- Yeah?

1014
01:11:43,924 --> 01:11:47,052
No, take your shot. You may only
get one, so it's gotta be good.

1015
01:11:47,161 --> 01:11:50,187
- But, coach, one outta one?
- Soft hands, Fulton.

1016
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:53,358
- Concentration, not strength.
- That's right!

1017
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:55,732
Okay? Let's get the Huskies!

1018
01:11:55,836 --> 01:11:57,861
Let's go! Come on!

1019
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:09,571
Let's back it up, boys.
Let's make it a fair one. Let's go!

1020
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:17,856
- Get in there!
- Come on!

1021
01:12:23,597 --> 01:12:26,566
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!

1022
01:12:27,768 --> 01:12:29,736
Shoot, Fulton, shoot!

1023
01:12:38,946 --> 01:12:41,073
We won!

1024
01:12:45,819 --> 01:12:47,753
We made the play-offs!

1025
01:13:01,435 --> 01:13:03,335
Boy, this is great.

1026
01:13:03,437 --> 01:13:05,598
Guys, look, it's the North Stars.

1027
01:13:05,673 --> 01:13:08,938
- Oh, man.
- It's Mike Modano!

1028
01:13:12,012 --> 01:13:13,946
- ... Believe this?
- Cool!

1029
01:13:14,014 --> 01:13:15,948
This is too cool.

1030
01:13:16,016 --> 01:13:18,177
I can't believe this.

1031
01:13:18,285 --> 01:13:21,516
This place is humongous.

1032
01:13:21,622 --> 01:13:24,022
What are we doing here?

1033
01:13:24,124 --> 01:13:26,149
It's a little play-offs present.

1034
01:13:32,166 --> 01:13:35,101
Hey, Gordo!
Gordon Bombay, right?

1035
01:13:35,169 --> 01:13:37,603
- You remember me?
- Sure, from Pee Wees.

1036
01:13:37,671 --> 01:13:41,300
- This guy used to rule in Pee Wees.
- I heard you were a farmer.

1037
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,309
Actually, I became a lawyer.

1038
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:45,641
But I'm coaching Pee Wee now
and this is my team, the Ducks.

1039
01:13:45,713 --> 01:13:49,809
- Ducks, this is Basil McRae and Mike Modano.
- We can see that.

1040
01:13:49,883 --> 01:13:51,817
- All right.
- Hey, Ducks!

1041
01:13:51,885 --> 01:13:53,853
Listen to this guy.
He knows what he's talking about.

1042
01:13:53,954 --> 01:13:57,185
If you ever want a shot, I'll get you
a tryout in the minor league clubs.

1043
01:13:57,291 --> 01:14:00,317
- Thanks.
- No problem. Hey, nice seein' ya.

1044
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:02,624
Take it easy.

1045
01:14:02,696 --> 01:14:05,824
All right, let's have some fun!

1046
01:14:05,899 --> 01:14:10,836
~ You've got to accentuate
the positive ~

1047
01:14:10,904 --> 01:14:14,840
~Eliminate the negative ~

1048
01:14:14,908 --> 01:14:19,004
~Latch on to the affirmative ~

1049
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:22,014
~Don't mess
with Mister In-between ~

1050
01:14:22,082 --> 01:14:27,042
~ You've got to spread joy
up to the maximum ~

1051
01:14:27,154 --> 01:14:31,147
~Bring gloom
down to that minimum ~

1052
01:14:31,225 --> 01:14:34,820
~Have faith or pandemonium ~

1053
01:14:34,895 --> 01:14:37,363
~ You're liable
to walk upon the sea ~

1054
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:41,492
~ To illustrate my last remark ~

1055
01:14:41,568 --> 01:14:46,164
~ Talking aboutJonah in a whale
and Noah in an ark ~

1056
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:51,177
~ What did they do
when everything looked so dark ~

1057
01:14:51,245 --> 01:14:54,214
~ Then they say ~

1058
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:59,184
~ You better
accentuate the positive ~

1059
01:14:59,253 --> 01:15:03,189
~Eliminate that negative ~

1060
01:15:03,257 --> 01:15:07,193
~Latch on to the affirmative ~

1061
01:15:07,261 --> 01:15:10,196
~Don't mess
with Mister In-between ~

1062
01:15:25,946 --> 01:15:31,384
~ We better
accentuate the positive ~

1063
01:15:31,452 --> 01:15:34,785
~Eliminate all the negative ~

1064
01:15:34,888 --> 01:15:38,585
~Latch on to the affirmative ~

1065
01:15:38,659 --> 01:15:41,719
~Don't mess
with Mister In-between ~

1066
01:15:41,795 --> 01:15:46,255
~No, don't mess
with Mister In-between ~

1067
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:48,267
- Hey!
- Hey!

1068
01:15:48,335 --> 01:15:52,271
~Don't you mess
with Mister In-between ~~

1069
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:57,799
You know, I heard the North Stars
wore the same underwear...

1070
01:15:57,911 --> 01:16:00,812
all through the play-offs
last year for luck.

1071
01:16:00,914 --> 01:16:02,814
So I'm doin' the same thing.

1072
01:16:02,916 --> 01:16:05,817
Hmm. Maybe I should've cooked.

1073
01:16:05,919 --> 01:16:09,855
You know, I'm thinkin' maybe we can all
go down to the winter festival tonight.

1074
01:16:09,957 --> 01:16:11,857
- All three of us?
- Sure.

1075
01:16:11,959 --> 01:16:14,291
I don't think I should,
'cause I got a lot of homework.

1076
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:17,797
You should go. With my mom.
By yourselves.

1077
01:16:19,867 --> 01:16:22,836
Mmm, smells great!

1078
01:16:22,936 --> 01:16:25,461
Hello.

1079
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:27,837
Go for it.

1080
01:16:27,941 --> 01:16:30,034
Hi.

1081
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,815
I don't know how they sculpt these.

1082
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:38,147
Hmm, I wonder.

1083
01:16:38,218 --> 01:16:41,847
I used to sculpt,
but now I do mostly paintings.

1084
01:16:41,955 --> 01:16:45,152
How do you think
they do the details?

1085
01:16:45,225 --> 01:16:49,491
Oh, little men.
Tiny chisels, big mittens.

1086
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:52,498
Oh.

1087
01:16:52,566 --> 01:16:54,500
I'm nervous.

1088
01:16:54,568 --> 01:16:56,502
I'm rambling on and on here.

1089
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:58,504
You probably think I'm weird.

1090
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:01,837
No, I think you're great.

1091
01:17:13,921 --> 01:17:18,358
When I was a little girl, I used
to pretend that that was an ice castle.

1092
01:17:18,425 --> 01:17:21,519
And that was my room,
that window right up there.

1093
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:23,688
And last winter
I gave Charlie that one.

1094
01:17:23,764 --> 01:17:26,858
What about me?
Which window's mine?

1095
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:30,370
I want to live there too.

1096
01:17:34,508 --> 01:17:38,410
What? What did I say?

1097
01:17:38,512 --> 01:17:42,448
- It's just not that easy.
- What's not that easy?

1098
01:17:42,549 --> 01:17:44,779
Casey, I was just
playin' around.

1099
01:17:44,885 --> 01:17:47,786
Look, I don't know
how you feel about me.

1100
01:17:47,888 --> 01:17:50,083
I don't even know
how I feel about you.

1101
01:17:50,190 --> 01:17:53,591
But I do know there's
a little kid back home...

1102
01:17:53,694 --> 01:17:57,186
who's absolutely falling
in love with his coach...

1103
01:17:57,264 --> 01:17:59,528
and if you
can't deal with that,

1104
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,898
if you're just playing around,
then you better let me know.

1105
01:18:01,969 --> 01:18:03,903
What are we talking?
'Til death do us part?

1106
01:18:03,971 --> 01:18:06,804
- I have to decide on the first date?
- Stop it, Gordon.

1107
01:18:06,907 --> 01:18:09,808
Charlie's gonna be there
when we get back.

1108
01:18:09,910 --> 01:18:13,073
And tomorrow.
And ten years from now.

1109
01:18:13,146 --> 01:18:15,580
Look, I can take it.

1110
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:20,814
But if Charlie
gets too attached -

1111
01:18:20,921 --> 01:18:24,652
Every time this happens,
it gets...

1112
01:18:24,758 --> 01:18:27,249
a little rougher on him.

1113
01:18:29,496 --> 01:18:31,987
Just on him?

1114
01:18:53,353 --> 01:18:56,254
I'm glad to be here with you.

1115
01:18:57,524 --> 01:18:59,617
Me too.

1116
01:18:59,993 --> 01:19:02,826
The surprising Ducks
are still in this game...

1117
01:19:02,929 --> 01:19:05,454
against the Hornets.

1118
01:19:05,532 --> 01:19:08,865
Banks moving right in front, stops.
He shoots, he scores!

1119
01:19:14,675 --> 01:19:18,634
It's getting rough out there
between the Ducks and the Hornets.

1120
01:19:18,712 --> 01:19:22,204
Here's Adam Banks in the slot.
He stops, shoots. He scores!

1121
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:31,987
Back it goes to Averman.
He shoots! Score!

1122
01:19:32,059 --> 01:19:36,155
The ducks win it,
5-3 over the Hornets.

1123
01:19:36,229 --> 01:19:38,493
And now it's on
to the semifinals...

1124
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:42,001
where the Ducks
will face the Cardinals.

1125
01:19:49,576 --> 01:19:52,875
What a game so far, ladies and
gentlemen! The Ducks and the Cardinals!

1126
01:19:52,979 --> 01:19:55,345
Cardinals with it in their own zone,
tryin'to clear it out.

1127
01:19:55,415 --> 01:19:57,474
Pass to the blue line,
intercepted by the Ducks.

1128
01:19:57,551 --> 01:20:01,851
Here's their star, Adam Banks. Banks
has great speed. Right down the middle!

1129
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:05,517
Goes around one man with a great move!
Steps around another defender!

1130
01:20:05,592 --> 01:20:07,526
He scores!

1131
01:20:22,509 --> 01:20:25,171
Come on! Come on,Jesse!

1132
01:20:25,245 --> 01:20:27,577
Ducks with it again.

1133
01:20:27,681 --> 01:20:30,844
Here's Averman,
now getting it over to Banks.

1134
01:20:30,917 --> 01:20:32,851
Germaine is right in the slot.
Germaine with it!

1135
01:20:32,919 --> 01:20:34,887
He shoots, he scores!

1136
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:37,719
Germaine put it off
the goaltender's glove into the net!

1137
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:41,056
And that does it! The Ducks have won!
Can you believe it?

1138
01:20:41,128 --> 01:20:46,862
4-2, and the Ducks now get set
to face the Hawks in the state finals.

1139
01:21:08,955 --> 01:21:11,219
All right, it's up to you, Gordon.

1140
01:21:11,291 --> 01:21:14,556
Now,you miss this shot,
you're not just letting your team down,

1141
01:21:14,628 --> 01:21:17,222
you're letting me down too.

1142
01:21:17,297 --> 01:21:20,061
Remember, it's not worth playing -

1143
01:21:20,133 --> 01:21:23,330
- If you can't win.
- That's right. Okay, son, let's go.

1144
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:36,344
Let's go, son!

1145
01:22:42,916 --> 01:22:47,683
~... Oh, say does
that star-spangled ~

1146
01:22:47,754 --> 01:22:51,884
~Banner yet wave ~

1147
01:22:51,992 --> 01:22:56,326
~ O'er the land of the free ~

1148
01:22:56,396 --> 01:23:01,857
~And the home of the brave ~~

1149
01:23:01,935 --> 01:23:05,029
- Let's go!
- Let's go! All right!

Go... Ducks!
Let's go!

1166
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:58,924
Hey, Banks.

1167
01:23:58,992 --> 01:24:01,927
Don't forget what side you're on.

1168
01:24:01,995 --> 01:24:05,726
He's a Duck,Jesse.
He'll play like a Duck.

1169
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:25,511
And the game is underway,

1170
01:24:25,618 --> 01:24:29,076
and right off Larson and McGill
with a heavy hit.

1171
01:24:29,155 --> 01:24:33,785
That gives you an indication
of what you're going to see tonight.

1172
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:36,795
Good hit! That's the way
I want you guys to play it!

1173
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:46,668
The Ducks in green
chasing it down against -

1174
01:24:46,773 --> 01:24:49,469
A hard hit out at centre ice!

1175
01:24:49,542 --> 01:24:51,772
Keep it away from 'em!
Come on, Banks!

1176
01:24:51,845 --> 01:24:54,143
Heavy hitting continues
in this championship game.

1177
01:24:54,214 --> 01:24:57,149
Banks up the centre ice.
He drives it down into the Hawks'zone.

1178
01:24:57,217 --> 01:25:00,482
Back in again to Larson,
the man behind the net.

1179
01:25:15,568 --> 01:25:18,503
Go, go, go!
Get it out of there!

1180
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:21,971
Banks, two comin' hard!

1181
01:25:22,042 --> 01:25:24,670
Banks still looking
for an opening, moves it up -

1182
01:25:24,744 --> 01:25:29,477
Banks gets knocked down against the boards.
The puck is intercepted by the Hawks.

1183
01:25:29,549 --> 01:25:33,417
Here's Larson, over to Brown. Brown,
in front, goes backhand. He scores!

1184
01:25:58,278 --> 01:26:00,075
Come on! Hustle!

1185
01:26:08,421 --> 01:26:10,355
Come on, you guys!

1186
01:26:13,293 --> 01:26:15,853
Hawks with a 1-0 lead,
come back to centre ice.

1187
01:26:15,929 --> 01:26:17,863
Larson gives it up to McGill.

1188
01:26:17,931 --> 01:26:20,365
Here's McGill, inside,
the lead at centre ice.

1189
01:26:20,433 --> 01:26:23,266
He's up on the blue line
and around the net.

1190
01:26:23,369 --> 01:26:25,269
And he scores!

1191
01:26:28,441 --> 01:26:31,968
And now the Hawks lead 2-0.

1192
01:26:39,486 --> 01:26:41,716
Good save, Goldberg!

1193
01:26:54,968 --> 01:26:57,402
All right, all right!
That's the kind of hockey...

1194
01:26:57,470 --> 01:26:59,404
I want to see
played all day, boys.

1195
01:27:02,909 --> 01:27:04,809
Larson stopped at the blue line,

1196
01:27:04,911 --> 01:27:07,277
but the Ducks can't clear it out.

1197
01:27:07,347 --> 01:27:09,645
McGill to Brown, left side.
He shoots! He scores!

1198
01:27:13,586 --> 01:27:19,422
The Hawks lead late
in the first period, 3-0.

1199
01:27:19,492 --> 01:27:22,655
Don't be scared of them, Ducks.
That's what they want.

1200
01:27:22,762 --> 01:27:25,822
Keep your heads up.
Play proud.

1201
01:27:25,932 --> 01:27:28,992
Let's fly! Come on, let's go!

1202
01:27:29,102 --> 01:27:31,502
All right, pressure, boys.
Pressure, pressure!

1203
01:27:31,604 --> 01:27:33,504
All right, hold it, hold it.

1204
01:27:33,606 --> 01:27:37,599
I want you to drop Banks like a bad
habit. I want him outta the game.

1205
01:27:37,677 --> 01:27:39,804
- Finish him off. You got it?
- Yeah.

1206
01:27:39,879 --> 01:27:41,471
Okay, boys, let's go.

1207
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:43,812
All right, all right, all right,
all right, all right!

1208
01:27:43,883 --> 01:27:46,647
Face-off for the second period,
and the Hawks win the draw.

1209
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:49,483
They get it back to Stickler.
3-0, Hawks lead.

1210
01:27:49,556 --> 01:27:52,821
Stickler to the blue line of the Ducks.
His pass taken away by Conway.

1211
01:27:52,892 --> 01:27:54,519
Go after him!

1212
01:27:54,627 --> 01:27:57,027
Taken by Adam Banks.
Here's Banks across the blue line!

1213
01:27:57,130 --> 01:27:59,030
McGill from behind!
Knocks Banks down!

1214
01:27:59,132 --> 01:28:01,464
Banks shoots! He scores!

1215
01:28:01,534 --> 01:28:04,196
Adam Banks with a great goal
for the Ducks!

1216
01:28:04,304 --> 01:28:08,832
McGill knocked him down
from behind, but Banks scored.

1217
01:28:14,147 --> 01:28:16,047
Adam.

1218
01:28:16,149 --> 01:28:18,140
Adam, are you okay?

1219
01:28:18,218 --> 01:28:22,484
- What'd you do?
- My job.

1220
01:28:22,555 --> 01:28:26,389
Okay, we need the paramedics in.
He's injured.

1221
01:28:26,492 --> 01:28:28,824
Oh, my God.

1222
01:28:28,895 --> 01:28:31,090
Come on, son, let's go.
Come on.

1223
01:28:37,870 --> 01:28:39,770
Number seven, McGill.

1224
01:28:39,872 --> 01:28:41,931
Cross-checking.
Two minutes.

1225
01:28:42,041 --> 01:28:44,771
Don't worry, guys.

1226
01:28:49,882 --> 01:28:52,043
Did it go in?

1227
01:28:52,118 --> 01:28:56,111
- Yeah, man.
- Jesse, do me a favour.

1228
01:28:56,222 --> 01:28:58,190
Kick some Hawk butt.

1229
01:28:58,258 --> 01:29:01,193
All right, cake-eater.

1230
01:29:06,566 --> 01:29:08,796
He'll be okay, sir.
We need to take some X rays, though.

1231
01:29:08,901 --> 01:29:11,301
Hell of a job, son.

1232
01:29:14,707 --> 01:29:16,971
They score against us,
they're gonna pay the price.

1233
01:29:17,076 --> 01:29:20,136
Now, don't worry.
We're gonna get that one back.

1234
01:29:20,246 --> 01:29:22,237
You got somethin'
to say to me, Bombay?

1235
01:29:22,315 --> 01:29:27,719
To think I wasted all those years
worrying about what you thought.

1236
01:29:30,156 --> 01:29:32,784
You're goin' down, Reilly.

1237
01:29:40,733 --> 01:29:43,497
- Let me go after 'em, coach. Let me get 'em.
- No, we're better than that.

1238
01:29:43,603 --> 01:29:48,506
Look, look, it's time
to play smart hockey, Duck hockey.

1239
01:29:48,608 --> 01:29:52,009
- All right? Now we got the power play.
- Yeah. All right.

1240
01:29:52,111 --> 01:29:56,775
We're gonna hit 'em
where it hurts the most: up there.

1241
01:29:56,849 --> 01:29:58,976
Fulton, you're in.

1242
01:29:59,085 --> 01:30:01,110
- Coach, they'll be rushin' him.
- Right.

1243
01:30:01,187 --> 01:30:03,655
Jesse, make sure you give
Fulton plenty of time.

1244
01:30:03,756 --> 01:30:05,451
- Right, coach.
- Jesse, do good.

1245
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:06,924
Let's go!

1246
01:30:06,993 --> 01:30:09,587
- Yeah!
- Hold it! Wait! Whoa!

1247
01:30:09,662 --> 01:30:11,459
Let's have fun out there.

1248
01:30:11,531 --> 01:30:13,465
- All right!
- All right!

1249
01:30:13,533 --> 01:30:15,364
Let's go!
Let's go!

1250
01:30:15,468 --> 01:30:18,801
The Ducks trail 3-1, and now they
call on number 44, Fulton Reed...

1251
01:30:18,871 --> 01:30:21,305
Get the face-off!

1252
01:30:21,374 --> 01:30:23,638
...who has a big, booming shot.

1253
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:26,474
And the Ducks get it
back to Fulton Reed.

1254
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:30,448
Hall clears the front of the net.
Here's Reed winding.

1255
01:30:34,554 --> 01:30:36,818
He scores!

1256
01:30:36,889 --> 01:30:40,620
Fulton Reed has scored,
and the Ducks are back in the game!

1257
01:30:40,693 --> 01:30:43,560
Yeah! Yeah!

1258
01:30:45,631 --> 01:30:48,156
Yes!

1259
01:30:48,234 --> 01:30:50,998
Yes! That's it!

1260
01:30:51,070 --> 01:30:54,301
More fun! More fun!

1261
01:30:54,374 --> 01:30:58,333
Of all the sloppy ass - Ladies,
they don't need our help out there!

1262
01:30:58,411 --> 01:31:00,845
Now I want that
Fulton Reed covered.

1263
01:31:00,913 --> 01:31:03,347
He better not make another shot.
You got it?

1264
01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:08,854
I'm tellin' you, you blow this game
and nobody makes the team next year!

1265
01:31:08,921 --> 01:31:11,355
All right, get out there!

1266
01:31:31,611 --> 01:31:33,511
Quick feet, now!
Quick feet!

1267
01:31:33,579 --> 01:31:35,513
The puck comes around,
now to Blake on the right side.

1268
01:31:35,581 --> 01:31:38,516
Blake through the slot
with a backhand. Scores!

1269
01:31:38,584 --> 01:31:40,745
Blake with a backhanded goal,

1270
01:31:40,853 --> 01:31:45,222
and the Hawks regain
the two goal lead at 4-2.

1271
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:47,350
Guys, guys, guys,
listen up, listen.

1272
01:31:47,427 --> 01:31:50,362
We have got to stay
fired up and focused, all right?

1273
01:31:50,430 --> 01:31:52,455
It ain't over 'til it's over.

1274
01:31:52,565 --> 01:31:56,865
Tammy, Tommy, let's show these Hawks
something really different. Come here.

1275
01:31:56,936 --> 01:32:01,236
All right.
I want you guys to start up here -

1276
01:32:01,307 --> 01:32:05,710
Third period and the Ducks trail 4-2,
trying desperately to get back in the game.

1277
01:32:05,778 --> 01:32:08,110
The Ducks with Tammy
and Tommy Duncan on the ice.

1278
01:32:08,214 --> 01:32:10,739
Tammy Duncan goes in front
of the net, Tommy with the puck.

1279
01:32:10,817 --> 01:32:14,082
Tammy's spinning,
and the Hawks are just looking at her.

1280
01:32:14,153 --> 01:32:15,916
- Come on.
- Come on!

1281
01:32:15,988 --> 01:32:18,582
Now!

1282
01:32:18,658 --> 01:32:20,956
Tammy Duncan shoots, she scores!

1283
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:23,290
Yes! Yes!
We're still alive!

1284
01:32:34,173 --> 01:32:36,641
I'm on, coach.

1285
01:32:36,742 --> 01:32:38,733
Yes, we're still in there!

1286
01:32:39,912 --> 01:32:41,812
He Grabs McGill from behind...

1287
01:32:41,914 --> 01:32:44,439
and throws him over the boards
into the bench.

1288
01:32:44,517 --> 01:32:47,145
Now he wants to pick a fight
with the entire Hawks team.

1289
01:32:47,253 --> 01:32:49,813
Fulton Reed has to be restrained
by the referee.

1290
01:32:49,922 --> 01:32:52,152
Game misconduct.
You're outta here, son.

1291
01:32:52,258 --> 01:32:54,158
I'm off, coach.

1292
01:32:54,260 --> 01:32:56,421
He barely touched him.

1293
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:09,007
Oreo line!

1294
01:33:09,108 --> 01:33:12,168
I want you to remember
what we learned.

1295
01:33:12,278 --> 01:33:14,508
- Ducks stick together, right?
- Yeah!

1296
01:33:14,614 --> 01:33:16,844
So let's see it!
Show me the flying "V."

1297
01:33:16,949 --> 01:33:18,348
- All right!
- All right!

1298
01:33:18,451 --> 01:33:20,783
Let's get a line change!
Let's go!

1299
01:33:20,853 --> 01:33:23,981
Here we go!
Come on, y'all, let's go!

1300
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:35,527
Come on! Come on!

1301
01:33:35,635 --> 01:33:37,626
Flying "V"!

1302
01:33:37,703 --> 01:33:42,140
Jesse Hall goes behind his own net,
joined by the rest of his team.

1303
01:33:42,208 --> 01:33:46,975
Here they come from behind the net!
It's the flying "V"!

1304
01:33:49,749 --> 01:33:51,512
Come on! Come on!

1305
01:33:51,584 --> 01:33:55,520
Terry Hall, with the puck,
moves the puck ahead to brotherJesse.

1306
01:33:55,588 --> 01:33:59,547
They stay onside the blue line. Jesse
Hall with it, trying to come down the slot.

1307
01:33:59,659 --> 01:34:03,356
Moves down the right side,
now in front of the net. Jesse scores!

1308
01:34:25,585 --> 01:34:29,521
With the score tied 4-4, the next goal
will decide the championship.

1309
01:34:29,589 --> 01:34:32,524
Tremendous pressure. Neither team
can afford any mistakes now.

1310
01:34:32,592 --> 01:34:35,220
23 seconds left to go in regulation.

1311
01:34:41,567 --> 01:34:43,967
Looking for
the game-winning goal,

1312
01:34:44,070 --> 01:34:46,698
here's Morgan moving into the slot.
He shoots and a big save.

1313
01:34:46,772 --> 01:34:50,731
Big save, Goldberg!
We'll get 'em in overtime!

1314
01:34:50,810 --> 01:34:54,906
Score tied at four.
Now Averman ahead to Charlie Conway.

1315
01:34:54,981 --> 01:34:57,211
- Come on, Charlie.
- Conway to centre ice on a breakaway!

1316
01:34:57,283 --> 01:35:00,912
Conway moving across the Hawk blue line,
down the middle! He could win the game!

1317
01:35:05,491 --> 01:35:08,585
Hey! Where's the call?

1318
01:35:08,661 --> 01:35:13,098
No time left on the clock, but
the referee is calling a penalty shot!

1319
01:35:14,266 --> 01:35:16,166
What kind of call is that?

1320
01:35:16,268 --> 01:35:18,828
Okay, we've got a penalty shot
for the Ducks.

1321
01:35:18,938 --> 01:35:22,169
Coach, penalty shot.
Anyone on the ice can take it.

1322
01:35:24,276 --> 01:35:26,836
All right, Ducks,
who's gonna take it?

1323
01:35:26,946 --> 01:35:28,846
- I think he should take it.
- Me?

1324
01:35:28,948 --> 01:35:30,848
What about Charlie?

1325
01:35:30,950 --> 01:35:33,111
- What about Charlie?
- All he does is fan.

1326
01:35:33,185 --> 01:35:35,119
Let's let him finish
what he started.

1327
01:35:35,187 --> 01:35:38,122
- Coach, we have a chance to win.
- Damn straight we do.

1328
01:35:38,190 --> 01:35:41,785
Come here. You been practising
that triple deke?

1329
01:35:41,861 --> 01:35:44,091
- Yeah.
- Then you're all set.

1330
01:35:44,163 --> 01:35:46,597
You may make it, you may not.

1331
01:35:46,666 --> 01:35:49,794
But that doesn't matter, Charlie.
What matters is that we're here.

1332
01:35:49,869 --> 01:35:51,803
Look around.

1333
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:54,635
Whoever thought
we'd make it this far?

1334
01:35:54,707 --> 01:35:59,144
One, two, three.
Triple deke.

1335
01:35:59,211 --> 01:36:01,839
Take your best shot.

1336
01:36:01,947 --> 01:36:06,475
I believe in you, Charlie,
win or lose.

1337
01:36:06,552 --> 01:36:10,648
- Thanks, coach.
- Go get 'em.

1338
01:36:12,892 --> 01:36:16,828
- All right, Charlie.
- Let's go, Charlie.

1339
01:36:27,573 --> 01:36:30,474
Okay, now wait for my signal.
Good luck.

1340
01:36:38,317 --> 01:36:44,187
Charlie, Charlie,
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie,

1341
01:36:44,256 --> 01:36:48,522
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie...

1342
01:36:48,594 --> 01:36:51,825
Okay, now don't leave your crease
before he touches the puck. Good luck.

1343
01:37:04,744 --> 01:37:07,372
Come on, Charlie.
Come on, Charlie.

1344
01:37:38,077 --> 01:37:40,807
~ We are the champions, my friend ~

1345
01:37:43,149 --> 01:37:46,084
~And we'll keep on fighting ~

1346
01:37:46,152 --> 01:37:49,986

01:37:50,089 --> 01:37:57,823

1348
01:37:57,930 --> 01:38:01,388
~No time for losers ~

1349
01:38:01,467 --> 01:38:06,666
~ 'Cause we are the champions ~

1350
01:38:06,772 --> 01:38:08,672

~ 'Til the end ~

1354
01:38:21,353 --> 01:38:23,287
~ Oh, we are the champions ~

1355
01:38:23,355 --> 01:38:25,255
Thank you, Hans.

1356
01:38:25,324 --> 01:38:28,122
I'm proud of you, Gordon.

1357
01:38:28,194 --> 01:38:29,923
~ We are the champions ~

1358
01:38:29,995 --> 01:38:34,022

Ducks, Ducks, Ducks,

1364
01:39:00,459 --> 01:39:02,654
Look, don't take
any bad dives, okay?

1365
01:39:03,796 --> 01:39:05,696
Just remember,

1366
01:39:05,798 --> 01:39:08,824
keep your head up, man.

1367
01:39:08,901 --> 01:39:10,835
Cake-eater.

1368
01:39:16,408 --> 01:39:19,172
Remember, strength,
not concentration.

1369
01:39:19,245 --> 01:39:21,179
Right.

1370
01:39:21,247 --> 01:39:24,182
And for God's sakes, soft hands.

1371
01:39:24,250 --> 01:39:27,549
Right. Anything else?

1372
01:39:27,653 --> 01:39:30,554
Yeah. Have fun
out there, coach.

1373
01:39:35,094 --> 01:39:38,029
I must be crazy.
A tryout with the minors.

1374
01:39:38,097 --> 01:39:41,362
I'm gonna be goin' up
against kids half my age.

1375
01:39:41,433 --> 01:39:44,527
Just have a good tryout, Gordon.
One step at a time.

1376
01:39:44,603 --> 01:39:47,197
Yeah, you're right.

1377
01:39:58,284 --> 01:40:00,548
Bye. I'll call you
when I get there.

1378
01:40:00,619 --> 01:40:02,883
Banks is first in line next!

1379
01:40:08,127 --> 01:40:10,186
Hey, Ducks!

1380
01:40:10,262 --> 01:40:13,060
No matter what happens,
we'll see you next season.

1381
01:40:13,132 --> 01:40:17,728

~But committed no crime ~

1408
01:42:08,394 --> 01:42:10,658
~And bad mistakes ~

1409
01:42:12,164 --> 01:42:14,655
~I've made a few ~

1410
01:42:16,135 --> 01:42:19,468
