1
00:01:36,636 --> 00:01:38,911
It's small!

2
00:01:52,076 --> 00:01:54,146
No, please. No!
Please!

3
00:01:54,396 --> 00:01:55,670
Davey!

4
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,072
Come running, lad!

5
00:01:59,836 --> 00:02:01,986
-Stop!
-Brand you like a damn steer!

6
00:02:02,236 --> 00:02:04,545
-Bitch!
-No. Please!

7
00:02:04,796 --> 00:02:06,991
Hold the bitch!
Go on, hold her!

8
00:02:07,236 --> 00:02:10,467
Hold her, damn it,
or I'll cut her tits off!

9
00:02:10,796 --> 00:02:12,707
Go get Skinny! Quick!

10
00:02:14,036 --> 00:02:15,310
Mike, don't!

11
00:02:20,676 --> 00:02:21,631
Skinny!

12
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:23,475
Think it's funny?

13
00:02:25,516 --> 00:02:27,586
Skinny, get the gun!

14
00:02:37,636 --> 00:02:39,866
Get off of her, cowboy.

15
00:02:46,276 --> 00:02:48,744
-Wouldn't let you settle it?
-You know Skinny.

16
00:02:49,116 --> 00:02:52,267
He says he'll shoot them.
I says, ''You can't. ''

17
00:02:52,516 --> 00:02:55,792
He says, ''Get Little Bill. ''
I says, ''He's sleeping. ''

18
00:02:56,036 --> 00:02:59,551
He says, ''He don't care. ''
He'll shoot them boys soon.

19
00:03:12,356 --> 00:03:13,914
She going to die?

20
00:03:14,196 --> 00:03:15,868
She's going to live.

21
00:03:17,876 --> 00:03:20,674
She didn't steal nothing
or touch his poke.

22
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:23,476
When she seen
his teensy little pecker. . .

23
00:03:23,716 --> 00:03:26,230
. . .she giggled.
She didn't know no better.

24
00:03:29,796 --> 00:03:31,707
You can hang them, Little Bill.

25
00:03:51,436 --> 00:03:54,269
Step over to the office
and get the bullwhip.

26
00:03:55,796 --> 00:03:58,947
A whipping's all they get
after what they done?

27
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:04,665
-It ain't no little thing, Alice.
-But what they done--

28
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,349
Shut up!

29
00:04:09,236 --> 00:04:11,704
-Whipping ain't going to settle this.
-No?

30
00:04:11,956 --> 00:04:15,426
Here's a contract between me
and Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut whore.

31
00:04:17,876 --> 00:04:21,266
I brought her from Boston,
paid her expenses and all.

32
00:04:21,756 --> 00:04:25,032
I got a contract that represents
an investment of capital.

33
00:04:25,316 --> 00:04:26,510
Property.

34
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,474
Damaged property.

35
00:04:29,956 --> 00:04:32,151
Like if I hamstrung
one of their ponies.

36
00:04:33,596 --> 00:04:35,632
You think nobody'll fuck her now?

37
00:04:37,516 --> 00:04:38,869
Hell, no!

38
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,834
Won't pay to do it!

39
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:45,195
She can clean, but nobody's going to pay
good money for a cut-up whore!

40
00:04:48,596 --> 00:04:52,748
You boys are off the Bar T.
Got your own string of ponies?

41
00:04:53,396 --> 00:04:55,387
Yeah, I got four.

42
00:04:57,876 --> 00:04:59,434
Six.

43
00:05:00,876 --> 00:05:03,515
You just as soon
not have a trial, no fuss?

44
00:05:04,196 --> 00:05:05,424
No, sir.

45
00:05:06,356 --> 00:05:07,391
All right.

46
00:05:08,036 --> 00:05:09,594
You did the cutting.

47
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:13,272
Come the fall, you bring in
five ponies to Skinny here.

48
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,110
Five?

49
00:05:15,476 --> 00:05:18,036
And you!
You bring in two.

50
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,312
-You give them over, hear?
-Yes, sir.

51
00:05:21,156 --> 00:05:22,384
The bullwhip.

52
00:05:25,156 --> 00:05:27,067
Maybe we don't need this now.

53
00:05:28,636 --> 00:05:32,948
Let me tell you, come the spring,
Skinny don't have those ponies. . . .

54
00:05:34,116 --> 00:05:37,153
-I'll come looking for you.
-You ain't whipping them?

55
00:05:39,156 --> 00:05:41,226
I fined them instead, Alice.

56
00:05:41,516 --> 00:05:44,076
Skinny gets some ponies and that's it?!

57
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,194
That ain't fair.

58
00:05:47,436 --> 00:05:48,710
That ain't fair!

59
00:05:55,996 --> 00:05:58,032
Haven't you seen
enough blood tonight?

60
00:06:01,756 --> 00:06:03,235
Hell, Alice!

61
00:06:04,316 --> 00:06:07,592
It ain't like they was tramps
or loafers or bad men.

62
00:06:07,836 --> 00:06:09,508
They were just. . .

63
00:06:09,756 --> 00:06:12,748
. . .hardworking boys that were foolish.

64
00:06:12,996 --> 00:06:16,784
-lf they was given over to wickedness--
-Like whores?

65
00:06:18,636 --> 00:06:20,354
Tend to Delilah.

66
00:06:22,876 --> 00:06:24,150
Go ahead.

67
00:06:45,756 --> 00:06:47,269
I got $85.

68
00:06:47,516 --> 00:06:48,915
I don't know.

69
00:06:49,356 --> 00:06:52,507
If Delilah doesn't care,
what are we so riled up about?

70
00:06:52,956 --> 00:06:56,266
Just because we let them smelly fools
ride us like horses. . .

71
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:59,588
. . .don't mean we let them
brand us like horses.

72
00:06:59,996 --> 00:07:04,865
Maybe we ain't nothing but whores,
but, by God, we ain't horses!

73
00:07:06,436 --> 00:07:08,666
I got $ 112.

74
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:10,990
That's everything.

75
00:07:11,236 --> 00:07:12,669
And you, Faith?

76
00:07:15,956 --> 00:07:16,832
200.

77
00:07:18,796 --> 00:07:21,071
$240.

78
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,471
Jesus, Faith!
What you been doing?

79
00:07:24,836 --> 00:07:27,145
Been giving Skinny something special?

80
00:07:31,836 --> 00:07:33,554
She laughs.

81
00:07:36,716 --> 00:07:40,345
With what Kate got, and Silky,
me and Little Sue--

82
00:07:40,596 --> 00:07:41,745
It ain't enough.

83
00:07:43,836 --> 00:07:45,315
Not yet, maybe.

84
00:08:24,236 --> 00:08:26,670
You don't look like no
rootin'-tootin' . . .

85
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,271
. . .son of a bitching
cold-blooded assassin.

86
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,110
Say what?

87
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:38,674
My guess is you call yourself
Mr. William Munny.

88
00:08:40,356 --> 00:08:43,154
You have me confused with
someone else, mister.

89
00:08:43,596 --> 00:08:46,554
The same who shot Charlie Pepper
in Lake County?

90
00:08:47,316 --> 00:08:48,544
Pa!

91
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:50,395
What's up, son?

92
00:08:50,636 --> 00:08:52,547
Two more hogs got the fever.

93
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:54,509
You shot Charlie Pepper.

94
00:08:54,756 --> 00:08:57,953
You killed William Harvey
and robbed that train in Missouri.

95
00:08:58,196 --> 00:08:59,424
Hold on, mister.

96
00:09:00,516 --> 00:09:03,189
Son, get those hogs separated there.

97
00:09:03,596 --> 00:09:05,234
Penny, help your brother.

98
00:09:05,516 --> 00:09:07,632
That one's sick too.

99
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,747
We'll talk inside.

100
00:09:20,876 --> 00:09:23,709
So you're Pete Sothow's nephew?

101
00:09:24,836 --> 00:09:29,352
I thought you'd come to kill me for
something I'd done in the old days.

102
00:09:31,076 --> 00:09:32,270
I could have.

103
00:09:32,596 --> 00:09:33,585
Easy.

104
00:09:35,796 --> 00:09:37,912
I guess maybe so.

105
00:09:39,196 --> 00:09:44,111
You don't look like no meaner-than-hell,
cold-blooded, damn killer.

106
00:09:45,196 --> 00:09:46,549
Maybe I ain't.

107
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:50,994
Uncle Pete says you was the meanest
goddamn son-of-a-bitch alive.

108
00:09:51,236 --> 00:09:53,545
And if I wanted a
partner for a killing. . .

109
00:09:54,116 --> 00:09:55,834
. . .you were the worst one.

110
00:09:59,276 --> 00:10:00,948
Meaning the best.

111
00:10:01,356 --> 00:10:03,790
On account as
you're as cold as snow. . .

112
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,789
. . .and don't have no
weak nerve nor fear.

113
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,914
Pete said that?

114
00:10:12,436 --> 00:10:14,108
Yeah, he did.

115
00:10:14,756 --> 00:10:16,553
I'm a killer myself,
except. . .

116
00:10:16,796 --> 00:10:19,868
. . .I haven't killed as many as you
because of my youth.

117
00:10:20,116 --> 00:10:22,505
Schofield Kid,
that's what they call me.

118
00:10:25,596 --> 00:10:26,870
Why?

119
00:10:27,116 --> 00:10:29,266
You from Schofield?

120
00:10:29,636 --> 00:10:31,194
No, it's on account. . .

121
00:10:31,436 --> 00:10:34,746
. . .of my Schofield model
Smith & Wesson pistol.

122
00:10:39,436 --> 00:10:40,835
How about it, Will?

123
00:10:41,836 --> 00:10:43,315
How about what?

124
00:10:43,756 --> 00:10:45,872
How about being my partner?

125
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:51,709
I'm heading north through Niobrara
to Wyoming to kill two no-good cowboys.

126
00:10:53,356 --> 00:10:54,550
For what?

127
00:10:54,836 --> 00:10:58,624
For cutting up a lady.
Cut up her face.

128
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,555
Cut her eyes out,
cut her ears off.

129
00:11:02,076 --> 00:11:04,670
They even cut her teets.

130
00:11:07,716 --> 00:11:08,944
Jesus!

131
00:11:09,756 --> 00:11:11,986
$ 1,000 reward, Will.

132
00:11:13,316 --> 00:11:14,635
500 apiece.

133
00:11:18,476 --> 00:11:20,751
I can't move those damn pigs!

134
00:11:21,756 --> 00:11:25,192
Watch your cussing, will you?
Do the best you can with it.

135
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:28,394
Then go to the pump
and get cleaned up. Come on.

136
00:11:34,756 --> 00:11:36,906
I ain't like that anymore, Kid.

137
00:11:38,316 --> 00:11:41,433
It was whiskey done it as
much as anything else.

138
00:11:41,796 --> 00:11:43,991
I ain't had a drop in over 10 years.

139
00:11:44,516 --> 00:11:47,986
My wife, she cured me of that.

140
00:11:49,156 --> 00:11:52,273
Cured me of drinking and wickedness.

141
00:11:53,836 --> 00:11:55,952
You don't look so prosperous.

142
00:11:58,036 --> 00:12:00,948
You could buy her a new
dress with your half.

143
00:12:01,196 --> 00:12:03,232
If we kill them, you can buy--

144
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,588
She's passed on.

145
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,791
Been gone near 3 years now.

146
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:22,466
Don't tell no one about the reward.
I don't need other gunmen collecting.

147
00:12:23,316 --> 00:12:25,113
We don't see no one out here.

148
00:12:26,836 --> 00:12:30,465
If you was to change your mind,
I'll be riding due west. . .

149
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,866
. . .for the trail into Wyoming.

150
00:12:37,996 --> 00:12:40,226
Come on, let's separate those hogs.

151
00:13:09,516 --> 00:13:10,585
Two others.

152
00:13:11,076 --> 00:13:13,226
I think they got the fever.

153
00:14:08,956 --> 00:14:10,787
Took you boys a while.

154
00:14:11,036 --> 00:14:15,188
A few more days and I was
going to call on the sheriff.

155
00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:16,630
How about that?

156
00:14:16,876 --> 00:14:19,868
The river was all swelled up.
Couldn't cross it.

157
00:14:20,116 --> 00:14:22,789
I bet. Sleepy,
get them horses to the livery.

158
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:25,550
Neil, take that one
over around the back.

159
00:14:32,836 --> 00:14:35,145
Now there's a beauty.

160
00:14:35,676 --> 00:14:38,349
You got two of mine.
This one here ain't yours.

161
00:14:38,596 --> 00:14:40,268
We'll see about that.

162
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:44,193
Bastards!
Get out of town!

163
00:14:46,076 --> 00:14:48,431
You are very sick sons of bitches!

164
00:14:53,036 --> 00:14:54,310
Don't come back, butcher!

165
00:14:54,556 --> 00:14:55,955
This here pony. . .

166
00:14:56,676 --> 00:14:59,429
. . .I brung for the lady my partner cut.

167
00:15:10,956 --> 00:15:12,275
She's the best.

168
00:15:17,396 --> 00:15:19,068
Better than what I gave him.

169
00:15:23,596 --> 00:15:25,268
She can sell her. . .

170
00:15:25,836 --> 00:15:27,474
. . .or do what she wants.

171
00:15:31,036 --> 00:15:35,587
A pony? She ain't got no face left,
you give her a mangy pony?

172
00:15:36,316 --> 00:15:37,829
She ain't mangy!

173
00:15:38,276 --> 00:15:40,392
Get out of here!

174
00:15:41,516 --> 00:15:43,825
We don't need your goddamn charity!

175
00:15:44,356 --> 00:15:46,824
Get out of our town
and don't come back!

176
00:15:48,876 --> 00:15:50,673
Get out of our town!

177
00:17:00,396 --> 00:17:03,274
Did Pa use to kill folks?

178
00:18:08,996 --> 00:18:12,227
I could tell your ma liked
those flowers I gave her.

179
00:18:12,476 --> 00:18:16,025
He ain't a saddle horse no more.
Ain't used to the feel.

180
00:18:17,316 --> 00:18:19,147
Take care of your sister, son.

181
00:18:19,396 --> 00:18:23,947
Kill a few chickens if you must.
Keep those hogs with the fever separate.

182
00:18:24,196 --> 00:18:28,712
If you have any problem, go see
Sally Two Trees at Ned Logan's.

183
00:18:52,796 --> 00:18:55,993
Ain't been in the saddle myself
in a while.

184
00:18:59,516 --> 00:19:03,065
She's getting even with me
for the sins of my youth.

185
00:19:03,316 --> 00:19:07,309
In my youth before I met
your dear departed ma. . .

186
00:19:07,556 --> 00:19:10,992
. . .I used to be weak
and given to mistreating animals.

187
00:19:16,116 --> 00:19:20,394
This horse
and those hogs over there. . .

188
00:19:23,156 --> 00:19:26,148
. . .are getting even
for the cruelty I inflicted.

189
00:19:26,396 --> 00:19:28,068
I used to be able to cuss. . .

190
00:19:28,316 --> 00:19:32,628
. . .and whip a horse, but your ma
showed me the error of my ways.

191
00:19:34,436 --> 00:19:35,835
I'll be back in two weeks.

192
00:19:36,756 --> 00:19:40,749
Remember the spirit of your dear
departed ma watches over you.

193
00:19:57,956 --> 00:20:00,754
-Where'd you get the money?
-We ain't got any!

194
00:20:00,996 --> 00:20:04,193
-You told them cowboys you had!
-We was lying!

195
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,228
Lying?

196
00:20:06,476 --> 00:20:09,274
What'll you do
if somebody comes to collect?

197
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:13,634
You going to hump them
a thousand times?

198
00:20:16,636 --> 00:20:20,515
The kind of people who come for it
won't tolerate you not having it!

199
00:20:23,876 --> 00:20:25,912
They won't just cut up your face!

200
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:32,112
You stupid bitches.

201
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:34,673
You stupid bitches!

202
00:20:46,596 --> 00:20:47,585
Shit!

203
00:20:47,836 --> 00:20:50,270
Damn it! Jesus!

204
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:53,350
Hit your finger?

205
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:57,235
Hello, Skinny.

206
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,587
Damn, you snuck up on me.

207
00:21:00,276 --> 00:21:02,312
What do you think of her?

208
00:21:02,556 --> 00:21:04,990
I heard you done the roof yourself.

209
00:21:05,236 --> 00:21:09,627
Roof? Jesus, I did practically
the whole damn thing myself.

210
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:13,585
The Roberts boy carried wood for me,
but that's all.

211
00:21:13,836 --> 00:21:15,633
What is all that wood?

212
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:19,511
I'm building a porch
so I can sit of an evening. . .

213
00:21:19,756 --> 00:21:24,113
. . .and smoke my pipe and drink coffee
and watch the sunset.

214
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,476
Came out here just
to take a look at her?

215
00:21:29,716 --> 00:21:31,627
-Them whores!
-Yeah?

216
00:21:31,876 --> 00:21:35,869
Been humping them cowboys
who been in town the last 2 weeks.

217
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:38,954
Shit, Skinny.

218
00:21:40,596 --> 00:21:43,394
We got railroad barons.
We got cattle barons.

219
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,786
You'll be the first billiard baron.

220
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:50,344
They been humping and telling
every bowlegged one of them. . .

221
00:21:50,596 --> 00:21:53,474
. . .they'll pay $ 1,000 to whoever. . .

222
00:21:53,716 --> 00:21:56,594
. . .kills the two boys
that cut up Delilah.

223
00:21:58,716 --> 00:22:02,789
Those cowboys are riding that beef
down to Kansas and Cheyenne?

224
00:22:10,476 --> 00:22:11,829
All week long?

225
00:22:12,116 --> 00:22:14,471
I didn't hear till last night myself.

226
00:22:15,076 --> 00:22:18,591
The word's probably got
all the way to Texas by now.

227
00:22:19,676 --> 00:22:21,667
Nobody'll come clear from Texas.

228
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,794
You sure they got that money?

229
00:22:26,276 --> 00:22:31,304
Women can lie. Ask where the
money is, they say they got none.

230
00:22:31,556 --> 00:22:35,674
But those five could have
squirreled it away. Maybe.

231
00:22:38,636 --> 00:22:40,149
That much?

232
00:22:41,556 --> 00:22:43,433
Could run off them two cowboys.

233
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,227
I could run off them whores.

234
00:22:49,116 --> 00:22:51,914
They'll just up and
run anyhow, them two.

235
00:22:55,676 --> 00:22:57,906
They'll stay out at the Bar T.

236
00:22:58,636 --> 00:23:00,228
Close to their friends.

237
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:04,714
Shit, could be nobody won't come at all.

238
00:23:07,116 --> 00:23:09,266
Got to go.
I like your house.

239
00:23:42,396 --> 00:23:44,387
Well, I'll be. . . .

240
00:23:45,556 --> 00:23:47,114
It's Will!

241
00:23:53,476 --> 00:23:56,786
Come in the house out of the sun.
Sally. . .

242
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:58,867
. . .see to Will's horse.

243
00:24:03,836 --> 00:24:05,508
What are you doing here?

244
00:24:06,076 --> 00:24:08,146
Just thought I'd drop in on you.

245
00:24:09,836 --> 00:24:12,304
We ain't bad men no more.

246
00:24:12,636 --> 00:24:14,228
We're farmers.

247
00:24:14,636 --> 00:24:19,232
Should be easy killing them,
if they don't go on down to Texas.

248
00:24:20,636 --> 00:24:24,709
How long since you fired a gun
at a man? Nine, ten years?

249
00:24:26,796 --> 00:24:27,911
Eleven.

250
00:24:29,756 --> 00:24:30,950
Easy, huh?

251
00:24:31,916 --> 00:24:34,874
I don't know it was
all that easy even back then.

252
00:24:35,196 --> 00:24:37,266
And we were young and full of beans.

253
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:40,067
If you was mad at them. . .

254
00:24:40,716 --> 00:24:43,310
. . .over some wrong,
I could see shooting them.

255
00:24:43,956 --> 00:24:46,550
We done stuff for money before.

256
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:51,992
We thought we did.

257
00:24:52,236 --> 00:24:55,148
What'd these fellows do?
Cheat at cards?

258
00:24:55,396 --> 00:24:58,786
Steal some strays?
Spit on a rich fellow? What?

259
00:24:59,156 --> 00:25:00,509
They cut up a woman.

260
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:02,104
What?

261
00:25:03,436 --> 00:25:08,430
Cut up her face, cut her eyes out,
cut her fingers off, cut her tits.

262
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:12,226
Everything but her cunny,
I suppose.

263
00:25:14,076 --> 00:25:15,589
I'll be dogged.

264
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:21,668
Guess they got it coming.

265
00:25:23,196 --> 00:25:24,629
Of course, Will. . .

266
00:25:25,836 --> 00:25:28,634
. . .if Claudia was alive,
you wouldn't do this.

267
00:25:38,636 --> 00:25:41,389
Could you look in on my youngsters
next week?

268
00:25:41,636 --> 00:25:44,389
They got some hogs
they're trying to separate.

269
00:25:46,476 --> 00:25:48,068
How long will you be gone?

270
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,149
Two weeks, I guess.

271
00:26:03,676 --> 00:26:05,189
What's this Kid like?

272
00:26:08,236 --> 00:26:09,464
Three ways?

273
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:14,075
I see you still have that Spencer rifle.

274
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:19,307
And I can still knock the
eye out of a bird flying.

275
00:26:28,236 --> 00:26:29,715
Jesus, Will!

276
00:27:24,556 --> 00:27:26,467
He must be moving right along.

277
00:27:26,956 --> 00:27:29,516
We'll come across him
tomorrow, I reckon.

278
00:27:40,796 --> 00:27:42,627
Kind of got used to my bed.

279
00:27:42,876 --> 00:27:45,231
This ain't going to be like no home.

280
00:27:46,316 --> 00:27:48,955
That ain't the only thing I'll miss.

281
00:27:54,276 --> 00:27:55,550
Hell, I'm sorry.

282
00:27:56,156 --> 00:27:59,512
Don't fret it.
It ain't nothing.

283
00:28:01,756 --> 00:28:03,474
She don't like it much. . .

284
00:28:03,716 --> 00:28:05,388
. . .you riding off with me.

285
00:28:06,356 --> 00:28:08,108
Gave me the evil eye.

286
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:14,066
You know, Sally's injun. . .

287
00:28:14,916 --> 00:28:16,986
. . .and injuns ain't over-friendly.

288
00:28:19,116 --> 00:28:20,469
I don't blame her.

289
00:28:21,836 --> 00:28:23,667
I won't hold it against her.

290
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:25,747
She knew me back then.

291
00:28:26,316 --> 00:28:27,669
She knew what a. . .

292
00:28:28,236 --> 00:28:30,545
. . .no-good son of a bitch I was.

293
00:28:32,316 --> 00:28:34,784
She ain't allowing that I changed.

294
00:28:35,596 --> 00:28:38,235
She don't realize I
ain't like that no more.

295
00:28:38,476 --> 00:28:40,706
-You know women.
-I ain't the same, Ned.

296
00:28:42,156 --> 00:28:46,707
Claudia straightened me up.
Cleared me of drinking whiskey and all.

297
00:28:48,076 --> 00:28:49,714
Going on this killing. . .

298
00:28:49,956 --> 00:28:52,914
. . .don't mean I'll go back
to the way I was.

299
00:28:54,236 --> 00:28:55,828
Just need the money.

300
00:28:56,316 --> 00:28:58,546
Get a new start for them youngsters.

301
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,306
Remember that drover
I shot in the mouth. . .

302
00:29:06,556 --> 00:29:09,024
. . .and his teeth came
out the back of his head?

303
00:29:12,236 --> 00:29:14,227
I think about him now and again.

304
00:29:17,276 --> 00:29:19,915
He didn't do anything
to deserve to get shot.

305
00:29:20,796 --> 00:29:23,435
At least nothing I remembered
when I sobered up.

306
00:29:28,556 --> 00:29:31,024
You was one crazy son of a bitch.

307
00:29:34,156 --> 00:29:36,989
No one liked me
and the boys all thought. . .

308
00:29:37,236 --> 00:29:39,591
. . .I'd shoot them
out of pure meanness.

309
00:29:42,076 --> 00:29:43,907
You ain't like that no more.

310
00:29:44,796 --> 00:29:46,866
Eagle, he hated my guts.

311
00:29:48,476 --> 00:29:50,944
Bonaparte didn't think too much of me.

312
00:29:51,516 --> 00:29:53,188
Quincy neither, I reckon.

313
00:29:55,516 --> 00:29:58,394
Quincy used to just watch all the time. . .

314
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,189
. . .scared.

315
00:30:02,316 --> 00:30:03,749
Like I said. . .

316
00:30:05,196 --> 00:30:07,027
. . .you ain't like that no more.

317
00:30:07,996 --> 00:30:09,270
That's right.

318
00:30:10,796 --> 00:30:12,627
I'm just a fellow now.

319
00:30:12,876 --> 00:30:15,595
I ain't no different than anyone else. . .

320
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:17,510
. . .no more.

321
00:30:32,276 --> 00:30:37,066
What son of a bitch shot him?
Was it one of them John Bulls?

322
00:30:37,316 --> 00:30:41,628
No, sir. The would-be assassin
is a gentleman of French ancestry.

323
00:30:41,876 --> 00:30:45,505
Or so it seems.
I don't wish to give offense. . .

324
00:30:45,756 --> 00:30:49,510
. . .but the French are known
to be a race of assassins. . .

325
00:30:49,756 --> 00:30:51,667
. . .who can't shoot worth a damn.

326
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:55,431
Any Frenchmen present
are excluded, of course.

327
00:30:55,676 --> 00:31:00,227
Says here a fellow by the name
of Guiteau. G-U-l-T--

328
00:31:00,476 --> 00:31:03,991
Sure as hell sounds
like a John Bull to me.

329
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:09,789
Again, I don't wish to give offense
when I suggest this country select. . .

330
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:14,154
. . .a king or even a queen,
rather than a President.

331
00:31:16,036 --> 00:31:18,834
One isn't that quick
to shoot a king or a queen.

332
00:31:19,076 --> 00:31:21,510
The majesty of royalty, you see.

333
00:31:24,476 --> 00:31:27,274
Maybe you don't wish to
give offense, sir. . .

334
00:31:27,556 --> 00:31:29,592
. . .but you are giving it pretty thick.

335
00:31:29,996 --> 00:31:32,635
This country don't need
no queens whatsoever.

336
00:31:32,956 --> 00:31:35,516
-When I heard about queens--
-Shut up, Joe.

337
00:31:35,756 --> 00:31:38,395
What's wrong with you, Thirsty?
This dude--

338
00:31:38,636 --> 00:31:41,389
Might be that this dude
is English Bob.

339
00:31:42,356 --> 00:31:45,268
Works for the railroad
shooting Chinamen.

340
00:31:45,516 --> 00:31:49,191
Might be he's waiting
for some cowboy to touch his pistol. . .

341
00:31:49,436 --> 00:31:50,994
. . .so he can shoot him.

342
00:32:02,316 --> 00:32:03,988
Is that a fact, mister?

343
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:06,628
You English Bob?

344
00:32:09,196 --> 00:32:10,151
Pheasants.

345
00:32:12,476 --> 00:32:14,387
Let's shoot some pheasants.

346
00:32:14,636 --> 00:32:15,830
Ten shots.

347
00:32:16,156 --> 00:32:18,716
At, let's say, $ 1 a pheasant.

348
00:32:19,356 --> 00:32:22,393
I'll shoot for the Queen, and you. . .

349
00:32:22,796 --> 00:32:24,309
. . .for whomever.

350
00:32:40,076 --> 00:32:41,987
That's eight for me and one for you.

351
00:32:42,236 --> 00:32:44,704
That comes to seven American dollars.

352
00:32:45,356 --> 00:32:47,267
Pretty damn good shooting. . .

353
00:32:47,836 --> 00:32:49,508
. . .for a John Bull.

354
00:32:49,996 --> 00:32:52,635
No doubt your aim was
affected by your grief. . .

355
00:32:54,956 --> 00:32:57,345
. . .over the injury to your President.

356
00:33:09,036 --> 00:33:12,949
It's the climate that does it.
That, and the infernal distances.

357
00:33:13,276 --> 00:33:14,231
Does what?

358
00:33:14,636 --> 00:33:17,594
Induces people to shoot
persons in high places.

359
00:33:25,596 --> 00:33:28,952
It's uncivilized shooting
persons of substance.

360
00:34:23,756 --> 00:34:24,950
Thank you.

361
00:34:27,596 --> 00:34:28,949
Pardon me, gentlemen.

362
00:34:31,196 --> 00:34:36,395
The law obliges you to surrender
sidearms to the proper authorities.

363
00:34:37,356 --> 00:34:38,584
Proper authority?

364
00:34:41,596 --> 00:34:46,795
I assure you that neither my companion
or I carry firearms on our person.

365
00:34:47,356 --> 00:34:50,985
We rely upon the goodwill
of our fellow man. . .

366
00:34:51,236 --> 00:34:53,591
. . .and the forbearance of reptiles.

367
00:35:06,476 --> 00:35:08,148
Unarmed, my ass!

368
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:10,510
Christ, it's hot!

369
00:35:10,756 --> 00:35:15,147
If I'm going to get shot,
I'd rather it was hot than cold.

370
00:35:15,396 --> 00:35:19,355
Everything hurts me more when it's cold.
You know how if you hit your--

371
00:35:19,596 --> 00:35:20,745
Shut up, Fatty!

372
00:35:22,796 --> 00:35:24,229
Clyde's back.

373
00:35:24,476 --> 00:35:26,228
-With Little Bill?
-No.

374
00:35:26,996 --> 00:35:27,985
Shit!

375
00:35:33,196 --> 00:35:35,869
-You clean my Remington?
-Cleaned and loaded.

376
00:35:36,996 --> 00:35:38,793
Where's Little Bill?

377
00:35:39,276 --> 00:35:40,834
Building his damn porch.

378
00:35:41,236 --> 00:35:42,828
Building his porch?

379
00:35:43,356 --> 00:35:46,587
If you got shot,
would you want it to be hot or cold?

380
00:35:46,876 --> 00:35:48,514
I ain't going to get shot.

381
00:35:50,396 --> 00:35:51,465
He's coming?

382
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,147
Of course he's coming.

383
00:35:54,916 --> 00:35:56,269
I just loaded that.

384
00:35:56,516 --> 00:35:59,428
I trust nobody loading my guns
if I'm shooting.

385
00:36:00,956 --> 00:36:01,832
What'd he say?

386
00:36:02,276 --> 00:36:05,188
Little Bill said
he was building his porch.

387
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:08,629
-You seen that thing?
-It was all loaded.

388
00:36:08,876 --> 00:36:12,107
Clyde, you got three pistols
and you only got one arm!

389
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:15,629
I don't want to get killed
for lack of shooting back.

390
00:36:18,356 --> 00:36:21,234
He don't have a straight
angle on that whole porch!

391
00:36:21,716 --> 00:36:23,627
Or the whole house, for that matter!

392
00:36:23,996 --> 00:36:26,032
He is the worst damn carpenter.

393
00:36:26,716 --> 00:36:28,274
He didn't say nothing?

394
00:36:29,116 --> 00:36:30,947
Asked what they looked like.

395
00:36:32,516 --> 00:36:35,155
Maybe he's tough but he
sure ain't no carpenter.

396
00:36:35,636 --> 00:36:37,354
Maybe he ain't so tough.

397
00:36:38,516 --> 00:36:40,108
Seem like he was scared?

398
00:36:41,956 --> 00:36:43,912
Little Bill? Him scared?

399
00:36:45,156 --> 00:36:48,228
We never seen him up
against any like these ones.

400
00:36:48,516 --> 00:36:49,392
Killers.

401
00:36:50,756 --> 00:36:53,714
Little Bill come out of
Kansas and Texas, boys.

402
00:36:54,436 --> 00:36:56,392
He worked them tough towns.

403
00:36:56,716 --> 00:36:57,990
Just wondered.

404
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:01,713
Anybody could be scared.

405
00:37:06,596 --> 00:37:08,427
He wasn't scared, boys.

406
00:37:09,636 --> 00:37:11,308
He just ain't no carpenter.

407
00:37:17,036 --> 00:37:19,231
There's a dignity in royalty. . .

408
00:37:19,476 --> 00:37:22,468
. . .which precludes
the likelihood of assassination.

409
00:37:22,716 --> 00:37:24,195
If you pointed a pistol. . .

410
00:37:24,436 --> 00:37:27,587
. . .at a monarch,
your hands would shake as if palsied.

411
00:37:27,836 --> 00:37:29,986
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody.

412
00:37:31,396 --> 00:37:33,227
That's a wise policy.

413
00:37:34,116 --> 00:37:37,472
But if you did, I assure you,
the sight of royalty. . .

414
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:42,232
. . .would cause you to dismiss thoughts
of bloodshed. You would stand. . .

415
00:37:42,476 --> 00:37:43,829
. . .how should I put it. . .

416
00:37:44,076 --> 00:37:45,668
. . .in awe.

417
00:37:48,316 --> 00:37:53,071
A President. . . .
Why not shoot a President?

418
00:37:58,596 --> 00:37:59,949
Keep the change.

419
00:38:00,196 --> 00:38:03,791
This Strawberry Alice
person, tell me again.

420
00:38:04,036 --> 00:38:07,631
Down the street to Greely's Beer
Garden and Billiards Parlor.

421
00:38:07,996 --> 00:38:10,305
Say you want a game of billiards.

422
00:38:10,556 --> 00:38:13,707
Billiards?
Even though I don't really wish to play?

423
00:38:13,996 --> 00:38:17,227
No matter. They burned the
table in '78 for firewood.

424
00:38:18,276 --> 00:38:19,789
Quite right.

425
00:38:21,036 --> 00:38:23,596
Mr. Beauchamp,
I think a cup of tea--

426
00:38:38,076 --> 00:38:39,270
Hello, Bob.

427
00:38:41,836 --> 00:38:44,225
Boys, this here is English Bob.

428
00:38:45,676 --> 00:38:47,507
Shit and fried eggs!

429
00:38:49,996 --> 00:38:51,429
Been a long time.

430
00:38:52,716 --> 00:38:54,069
Run out of Chinamen?

431
00:38:56,196 --> 00:38:58,505
I thought that you were dead.

432
00:38:59,596 --> 00:39:01,905
You've shaved your chin whiskers off.

433
00:39:02,836 --> 00:39:05,748
I was tasting the soup
two hours after I ate it.

434
00:39:06,756 --> 00:39:08,553
Actually, what I heard was you. . .

435
00:39:08,796 --> 00:39:11,469
. . .fell off your horse,
drunk, of course.

436
00:39:11,756 --> 00:39:14,224
And that you broke your bloody neck.

437
00:39:15,716 --> 00:39:17,593
I heard that one myself, Bob.

438
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:19,747
Hell, I even thought I was dead.

439
00:39:20,036 --> 00:39:22,504
Till I found out I was just in Nebraska.

440
00:39:24,076 --> 00:39:25,111
Who's he?

441
00:39:25,836 --> 00:39:27,030
W.W. Beauchamp.

442
00:39:28,236 --> 00:39:30,704
This is Little Bill Daggett.

443
00:39:31,596 --> 00:39:33,552
And friends, of course.

444
00:39:34,596 --> 00:39:36,951
>From Newton, Hays? From Abilene?

445
00:39:37,676 --> 00:39:39,348
In person.

446
00:39:40,676 --> 00:39:42,871
You work for the railroads too?

447
00:39:44,876 --> 00:39:45,911
I write.

448
00:39:46,956 --> 00:39:47,945
Letters?

449
00:39:48,396 --> 00:39:50,068
Books, Bill. Books.

450
00:39:51,116 --> 00:39:52,151
Actually. . .

451
00:39:52,716 --> 00:39:54,547
. . .he's my biographer.

452
00:40:00,556 --> 00:40:02,865
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

453
00:40:10,436 --> 00:40:11,835
It's only a book.

454
00:40:12,396 --> 00:40:13,385
A book?

455
00:40:19,516 --> 00:40:20,995
That means you boys can read.

456
00:40:21,996 --> 00:40:27,628
That means you saw the signs outside
town saying surrender your firearms.

457
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:31,467
But like you told young Andy. . .

458
00:40:33,276 --> 00:40:34,834
. . .you're not armed, are you?

459
00:40:36,396 --> 00:40:37,909
Not really, Bill.

460
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:42,706
Got a Peacemaker, but that
wouldn't worry you, would it?

461
00:40:43,076 --> 00:40:46,386
If you don't see it.
Or better, if you don't hear it.

462
00:40:47,596 --> 00:40:49,234
I'm afraid so, Bob.

463
00:40:49,996 --> 00:40:51,793
I don't like firearms around.

464
00:41:12,996 --> 00:41:14,714
Be very careful with it, sonny.

465
00:41:20,876 --> 00:41:23,595
See what kind of books
Mr. Beauchamp is packing.

466
00:41:28,076 --> 00:41:29,907
Make sure you don't get wet.

467
00:41:36,636 --> 00:41:37,830
No shit.

468
00:41:38,076 --> 00:41:40,874
All he's got is writing
stuff and this book.

469
00:41:43,516 --> 00:41:45,507
''The Duck of Death''?

470
00:41:45,756 --> 00:41:46,984
Duke.

471
00:41:48,676 --> 00:41:50,029
''The Duke. ''

472
00:41:53,076 --> 00:41:54,987
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

473
00:41:55,236 --> 00:41:57,272
I'll have that .32, Bob.

474
00:42:09,876 --> 00:42:11,468
Now, Little Bill. . .

475
00:42:12,156 --> 00:42:15,307
. . .you will leave me at
the mercy of my enemies.

476
00:42:19,876 --> 00:42:21,355
Enemies?

477
00:42:24,316 --> 00:42:26,989
You been talking about the Queen again?

478
00:42:27,996 --> 00:42:29,190
On Independence Day?

479
00:42:41,756 --> 00:42:43,428
I guess you think I'm kicking you.

480
00:42:45,076 --> 00:42:46,475
But it ain't so!

481
00:42:46,876 --> 00:42:48,673
What I'm doing is talking!

482
00:42:48,956 --> 00:42:49,832
Hear?!

483
00:42:50,396 --> 00:42:52,626
Talking to all them villains in Kansas!

484
00:42:52,876 --> 00:42:55,265
To all those villains in Missouri!

485
00:43:02,716 --> 00:43:03,910
And those villains. . .

486
00:43:05,276 --> 00:43:07,073
. . .down in Cheyenne!

487
00:43:12,636 --> 00:43:15,070
I'm saying there ain't no whore's gold!

488
00:43:20,476 --> 00:43:23,388
Even if there was, they
don't want to come for it. . .

489
00:43:24,516 --> 00:43:25,665
. . .anyhow!

490
00:43:53,716 --> 00:43:55,115
What are you looking at?!

491
00:43:55,356 --> 00:43:56,550
Go on!

492
00:44:03,676 --> 00:44:05,507
Mind your own business!

493
00:44:33,356 --> 00:44:34,675
Ever go into town?

494
00:44:35,876 --> 00:44:39,585
On occasion.
To sell a hog, pick up supplies.

495
00:44:41,116 --> 00:44:43,311
I mean, get yourself a woman.

496
00:44:46,476 --> 00:44:48,592
No, I never go into town for that.

497
00:44:48,836 --> 00:44:50,633
A man like me?

498
00:44:51,636 --> 00:44:55,072
Only woman I could get is
one I'd have to pay for.

499
00:44:55,716 --> 00:44:57,866
That ain't right, buying flesh.

500
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:02,752
Claudia, rest her soul,
wouldn't want me doing that. . .

501
00:45:02,996 --> 00:45:04,395
. . .me being a father.

502
00:45:08,756 --> 00:45:10,712
You just use your hand?

503
00:45:16,476 --> 00:45:18,990
I don't miss it all that much.

504
00:45:38,956 --> 00:45:41,026
Goddamn!
Somebody's shooting at us!

505
00:45:42,316 --> 00:45:43,749
Did it hit you?

506
00:45:45,916 --> 00:45:48,350
I bumped my head
falling off my horse.

507
00:45:53,436 --> 00:45:55,267
Ain't shooting at us no more.

508
00:45:57,596 --> 00:45:59,109
Shooting way over yonder.

509
00:46:01,436 --> 00:46:03,427
What the hell's he shooting at?

510
00:46:03,996 --> 00:46:05,668
Beats the hell out of me.

511
00:46:08,716 --> 00:46:10,786
Reckon we in somebody's field?

512
00:46:11,036 --> 00:46:12,867
I didn't see nothing planted.

513
00:46:13,876 --> 00:46:15,275
Shooting at us again.

514
00:46:19,636 --> 00:46:21,945
He's shooting at the whole horizon.

515
00:46:23,116 --> 00:46:24,708
Wait! You'll mark us!

516
00:46:24,956 --> 00:46:26,150
Hey, Kid!

517
00:46:28,396 --> 00:46:29,988
That's the Kid shooting at us?

518
00:46:30,316 --> 00:46:31,908
Kid, it's me! Will Munny!

519
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:34,386
What the hell's he shooting at us for?

520
00:46:34,636 --> 00:46:35,751
That you?

521
00:46:38,476 --> 00:46:39,750
Yeah, it's me!

522
00:46:40,276 --> 00:46:43,268
Don't go shooting at us
no more! You hear me?

523
00:46:43,996 --> 00:46:46,146
Who the hell you got with you, Will?

524
00:46:47,196 --> 00:46:49,426
It's Ned Logan, my old partner!

525
00:46:49,756 --> 00:46:52,065
Don't go shooting at us, you hear?

526
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:55,595
We'll get our horses
and come on over there.

527
00:46:55,956 --> 00:46:57,947
You ain't going to shoot, are you?

528
00:47:00,156 --> 00:47:01,350
No, I ain't!

529
00:47:13,596 --> 00:47:17,555
-Chased that horse a damn mile.
-What was you shooting at us for?

530
00:47:17,796 --> 00:47:20,435
-I thought you was following me.
-We was.

531
00:47:20,676 --> 00:47:24,988
-You said if I changed my mind--
-Wasn't nothing said about no partner.

532
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,428
This here's Ned Logan.

533
00:47:27,676 --> 00:47:30,668
He's the Schofield Kid,
nephew to Pete Sothow.

534
00:47:30,916 --> 00:47:34,704
I seen two fellows following me.
My guess is you come to kill me.

535
00:47:36,156 --> 00:47:38,545
We never talked about no other fellow.

536
00:47:38,796 --> 00:47:42,994
There's two cowboys. Better there's
three of us, if they got friends.

537
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:46,911
I can take care of them two myself.
It don't take three.

538
00:47:47,716 --> 00:47:51,789
Ned's an awful good shot with a rifle.
Hit a bird in the eye flying.

539
00:47:52,356 --> 00:47:54,153
Better than you, anyhow.

540
00:47:54,636 --> 00:47:55,864
You wasn't even close.

541
00:47:56,116 --> 00:47:58,505
Get your damn hands off my rifle!

542
00:48:07,516 --> 00:48:11,145
Thought I'd check it for you.
Maybe something's bent.

543
00:48:11,396 --> 00:48:12,749
It ain't bent.

544
00:48:13,836 --> 00:48:15,633
You were shooting all over creation!

545
00:48:15,876 --> 00:48:17,389
You'll share your half with him?

546
00:48:18,036 --> 00:48:19,674
I figure three ways.

547
00:48:20,836 --> 00:48:22,155
You figured wrong.

548
00:48:23,756 --> 00:48:26,111
Sorry I wasted your time, Ned.

549
00:48:28,436 --> 00:48:30,074
You going back with him?

550
00:48:31,076 --> 00:48:32,873
He's my partner.

551
00:48:33,196 --> 00:48:34,868
He don't go, I don't go.

552
00:48:39,436 --> 00:48:41,552
What's it come to, three ways?

553
00:49:33,356 --> 00:49:34,505
Shit!

554
00:49:36,076 --> 00:49:38,067
What are you pissing on about?

555
00:49:40,076 --> 00:49:43,512
-What are you looking at, anyhow?
-''Looking at''?

556
00:49:43,756 --> 00:49:45,075
Clouds, Kid.

557
00:49:45,476 --> 00:49:49,151
Looking at them on account of
we got a storm riding up our ass.

558
00:49:52,196 --> 00:49:53,675
Hell, I seen them.

559
00:50:03,716 --> 00:50:06,025
You was smart to change your mind.

560
00:50:09,156 --> 00:50:11,306
I'm a real good shot with this rifle.

561
00:50:13,836 --> 00:50:15,315
See that hawk?

562
00:50:18,596 --> 00:50:20,154
I could hit it with one shot.

563
00:50:24,036 --> 00:50:27,790
Hell, I could hit it too.
If I didn't mind wasting a shot.

564
00:50:30,476 --> 00:50:32,114
There ain't no hawk, Kid.

565
00:50:33,156 --> 00:50:34,987
You can't see for shit, can you?

566
00:50:38,156 --> 00:50:39,794
See your canteen?

567
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:47,429
How far can you see?

568
00:50:47,676 --> 00:50:51,112
-Far enough.
-We ain't shooting canteens! How far?

569
00:50:51,356 --> 00:50:53,506
-100 yards?
-More.

570
00:50:53,756 --> 00:50:56,316
-See that scrub oak tree yonder?
-Fuck you.

571
00:50:56,556 --> 00:50:58,069
-He's blind!
-I ain't!

572
00:50:58,316 --> 00:50:59,465
Asshole!

573
00:50:59,876 --> 00:51:01,229
Hold it!

574
00:51:02,076 --> 00:51:04,465
How far can you see, Kid?
50 yards?

575
00:51:04,956 --> 00:51:07,675
You bet your ass
I can see 50 yards, Will.

576
00:51:08,076 --> 00:51:11,307
I can see well enough
to shoot this son of a bitch.

577
00:51:11,596 --> 00:51:12,790
Hold on.

578
00:51:13,316 --> 00:51:14,669
Hear that, Ned?

579
00:51:14,956 --> 00:51:17,265
Kid can see 50 yards. Fine.

580
00:51:18,516 --> 00:51:19,471
Jesus!

581
00:51:22,756 --> 00:51:25,987
50 yards'll do just fine.
Now let's move out.

582
00:51:34,996 --> 00:51:37,669
They look like real hard cases, Bob.

583
00:51:39,076 --> 00:51:40,589
Did you kill all seven of them?

584
00:51:40,836 --> 00:51:42,747
Or just wing some of them?

585
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:51,468
That you here embalmed on the cover?

586
00:51:53,676 --> 00:51:55,394
''The Duck of Death''?

587
00:51:56,756 --> 00:51:59,509
It's the Duke.
''Duke of Death. ''

588
00:52:03,276 --> 00:52:07,269
You always were the hell in Jesus
with a pistol, but seven of them?

589
00:52:07,516 --> 00:52:09,984
Protecting that woman.
How do you do that?

590
00:52:14,236 --> 00:52:18,115
It's desirable in the publishing
business to take a certain. . .

591
00:52:18,356 --> 00:52:21,109
. . .liberty when depicting
the cover scene.

592
00:52:21,356 --> 00:52:23,108
For reasons involving the marketplace--

593
00:52:23,396 --> 00:52:27,674
>From what I read, the writing's not
that much different than the picture.

594
00:52:29,916 --> 00:52:32,225
I can assure you, Mr. Daggett. . .

595
00:52:32,596 --> 00:52:36,145
. . .that the events described are
from eyewitness accounts.

596
00:52:36,396 --> 00:52:37,988
Eyewitnesses?

597
00:52:38,916 --> 00:52:40,747
Like the Duck himself, I guess.

598
00:52:42,956 --> 00:52:44,105
The Duke.

599
00:52:44,516 --> 00:52:45,744
Duck, I says.

600
00:52:53,996 --> 00:52:57,875
'''You have insulted the honor of
this beautiful woman, Corcoran. . .'

601
00:52:58,116 --> 00:52:59,310
. . .said the Duck.

602
00:53:00,596 --> 00:53:02,427
'You must apologize.'

603
00:53:02,796 --> 00:53:05,151
But Two-Gun Corcoran
would have none of it.

604
00:53:05,396 --> 00:53:08,672
Cursing, he reached for his
pistols and would have killed him. . .

605
00:53:08,916 --> 00:53:13,307
. . .but the Duck was faster and hot lead
blazed from his smoking six-guns. ''

606
00:53:14,796 --> 00:53:17,469
I consider that an accurate
depiction of events.

607
00:53:17,716 --> 00:53:21,914
There is a certain poetry to the
language which I couldn't resist.

608
00:53:24,996 --> 00:53:28,033
I was in the Blue Bottle
Saloon in Wichita. . .

609
00:53:28,356 --> 00:53:31,234
. . .the night English Bob
killed Corky Corcoran.

610
00:53:31,916 --> 00:53:33,554
I didn't see you there.

611
00:53:34,356 --> 00:53:35,789
Nor no woman.

612
00:53:36,036 --> 00:53:38,072
Nor two-gun shooters.

613
00:53:38,356 --> 00:53:40,950
-Nor none of this.
-You were there?

614
00:53:41,196 --> 00:53:42,549
Yeah, I was there.

615
00:53:45,156 --> 00:53:46,430
First off. . .

616
00:53:47,076 --> 00:53:50,546
. . .Corky never carried two guns,
though he should have.

617
00:53:50,996 --> 00:53:52,827
He was called Two-Gun Corcoran.

618
00:53:53,076 --> 00:53:57,433
A lot of folks did call him Two-Gun,
but not because he had two pistols.

619
00:53:57,676 --> 00:53:59,587
It was because his dick. . .

620
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:03,112
. . .was longer than the barrel
on his Walker Colt.

621
00:54:04,636 --> 00:54:08,311
Only insulting he did was stick it
into a French lady. . .

622
00:54:08,556 --> 00:54:10,069
. . .that he was sweet on.

623
00:54:10,436 --> 00:54:15,635
When Corky walked into the Blue Bottle
and before he knew what's what. . .

624
00:54:15,876 --> 00:54:19,232
. . .Bob takes a shot at him!
And misses, he's so damn drunk.

625
00:54:19,476 --> 00:54:23,469
That bullet whizzing by panicked
Corky. He did the wrong thing.

626
00:54:24,276 --> 00:54:26,426
He hurried
and shot his damn toe off.

627
00:54:27,396 --> 00:54:29,148
Meantime, Bob here. . .

628
00:54:30,036 --> 00:54:32,596
. . .aims real good
and squeezes off another. . .

629
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:37,591
. . .but he misses, he's still so drunk!
Hits a $ 1,000 mirror over the bar.

630
00:54:38,516 --> 00:54:41,349
The Duck of Death is as good as dead. . .

631
00:54:41,596 --> 00:54:43,348
. . .because Corky does it right.

632
00:54:43,996 --> 00:54:45,634
He aims real careful.

633
00:54:46,076 --> 00:54:47,794
-No hurry.
-And?

634
00:54:50,116 --> 00:54:55,349
That Walker Colt blew up in his hand,
a failing common to that model.

635
00:54:56,076 --> 00:55:00,069
If Corky'd had two guns instead of
a big dick, he would've been there. . .

636
00:55:01,236 --> 00:55:03,796
. . .to defend himself to the end.

637
00:55:04,116 --> 00:55:05,435
Wait a minute.

638
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:10,145
English Bob killed him when
he didn't even have. . . .

639
00:55:10,476 --> 00:55:13,912
Bob wasn't going to wait
for Corky to grow a new hand.

640
00:55:14,316 --> 00:55:16,955
No, he just
walked over there real slow. . .

641
00:55:18,396 --> 00:55:19,590
. . .because he was drunk. . .

642
00:55:21,876 --> 00:55:23,832
. . .and shot him
through the liver.

643
00:55:43,436 --> 00:55:45,745
Don't like rocks
on my dadgum back!

644
00:55:46,636 --> 00:55:49,753
-I sure do miss my bed.
-You said that last night.

645
00:55:49,996 --> 00:55:54,547
Last night I said I missed my wife.
Tonight I just miss my dadgum bed!

646
00:55:56,076 --> 00:55:59,193
You'll miss your dadgum roof next,
I suppose.

647
00:56:00,796 --> 00:56:02,149
Shit!

648
00:56:16,516 --> 00:56:18,586
That business
up in Jackson County. . .

649
00:56:18,836 --> 00:56:20,474
. . .that really happen?

650
00:56:20,716 --> 00:56:22,354
The way they say it happened?

651
00:56:23,236 --> 00:56:24,191
What business?

652
00:56:26,796 --> 00:56:30,471
There's two deputies up close
pointing their rifles right at you.

653
00:56:30,716 --> 00:56:32,388
Got you dead to rights.

654
00:56:32,716 --> 00:56:35,549
You pulled out your pistol
and blew them to hell.

655
00:56:36,236 --> 00:56:37,908
Only took a scratch yourself.

656
00:56:44,396 --> 00:56:46,830
Uncle Pete never seen nothing like it. . .

657
00:56:47,076 --> 00:56:49,510
. . .shooting your way out
of that scrape.

658
00:56:53,956 --> 00:56:55,594
I don't recollect.

659
00:56:58,796 --> 00:57:00,548
You don't recollect?

660
00:57:01,356 --> 00:57:02,425
Right.

661
00:57:04,276 --> 00:57:05,265
Ned. . .

662
00:57:08,356 --> 00:57:10,028
. . .how many men you killed?

663
00:57:14,636 --> 00:57:16,308
Aren't you going to answer?

664
00:57:16,876 --> 00:57:18,548
What the hell's that to you?

665
00:57:21,356 --> 00:57:25,952
To know the kind of fellow I'm riding
with, in case we get into a scrape.

666
00:57:29,356 --> 00:57:31,233
How many men you killed, Kid?

667
00:57:31,836 --> 00:57:32,791
Five.

668
00:57:33,036 --> 00:57:33,991
How many?

669
00:57:36,676 --> 00:57:37,631
Five!

670
00:57:38,676 --> 00:57:40,667
I done killed five of them.

671
00:57:42,196 --> 00:57:45,280
That's including a Mexican.
He come after me with a knife.
