00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,837
[narrator] Once upon a time,

00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:47,841
back before I knew
how to tie my shoes,

3
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:50,477
the sun came up.

00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,647
Now, I know an
everyday sunrise

5
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:58,518
may not seem like
such a big deal to some folks,

6
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,820
but imagine for a moment

7
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:03,122
if instead of rising up,

8
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,091
like this,

00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:07,360
one morning
where you lived

10
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:08,862
she took a look around

11
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:12,432
and decided
to go back to sleep.

12
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:15,335
It happened once to us.

00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,314
that he liked to

and Chanticleer's
was to wake up the sun.

34

old Chanticleer

Good day, Mr. Chanticleer.

But all that
was about to change.

66
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,015
One morning,

67
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,350
before Chanticleer
was even awake,

68
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,453
-a stranger snuck
onto our farm...
-Hey, Chanticleer!

69
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,422
...to stop Chanticleer
from crowing!

70
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:51,457
Of course, Chanticleer
wouldn't give up

71
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:52,992
without a fight.

72
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,895
But what he didn't know
was that this stranger

73
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,399
had been sent
by the Grand Duke of Owls.

74
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,868
A nasty fella.

75
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:07,907
The good news here

76
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,076
was that Chanticleer
had won the fight.

77
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,745
The bad news was
the Grand Duke's bully

78
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,281
had done his dirty deed.

79
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,450
For in all the commotion,

80
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:21,020
Chanticleer had plum forgot
to crow,

81
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:26,125
and the sun was comin' up
without him.

82
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:27,860
[animals gasp]

83
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:31,798
When Chanticleer saw this,
it broke his heart.

84
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:35,968
He reckoned maybe his crow
never did raise the sun.

85
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,739
Look! It's comin' up
without him!

86
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:42,442

00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:50,316
The Grand Duke's evil plan
had worked.

90
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:54,520
He had turned us against
our very best friend.

91
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:56,989
And without a reason to crow,

92
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:59,158
poor Chanticleer
left the farm

93
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,427
to look for work in the city.

94
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:05,565
Then came the rain,

95
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,868

with the Duke.

That's the Grand Duke.

He's the one who's
causing all the trouble.

99
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,381
He sent that mean old rooster
to Chanticleer's farm

100
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,516
to pick a fight.

101
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,785
Hmm. How come?

102
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,054
Because he didn't
like Chanticleer

103
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,522
doing all that crowing

104
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:30,957
and bringing up
the sun.

00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:36,095
Well, like most owls,

107
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:40,433

and the rain.

Poor Edmond's family
was havin' their share, too.

The river's
rising too fast!

reinforce the sandbags!

that'll work?

We'll make it work.
I'll get the boys.

to call for Chanticleer,

168
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,679

who was going to answer...

00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:53,993
I'm always doing that.

180
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:58,664
But, you see,
we creatures of the night

181
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,933
have worked very hard

182
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,537
to make absolutely sure

183
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:08,741
that that bird does not return.

184
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,242
And you...

185
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:14,380
You, with no regard
for the feelings of others,

186
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,648
have the nerve

187
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:19,218
to call him back here by name!

188
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,021
And besides,

189
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:27,760
I positively loathe
rock 'n' roll!

190
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,328
[laughs boisterously]

191
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,030
You're not gonna eat me!

192
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,232
[Patou]
And that's when the Duke
hit the ceiling!

193
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,634
If Edmond wanted
to bring Chanticleer back

194
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,336
to raise the sun,

195
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:40,373
the Duke was going to have
something to say about it.

196
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:43,976
Kittens are more digestible.

197
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:47,913
Young Edmond was about to have
the most amazing adventure

198
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,049
he'd ever dreamed of.

199
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,117
[laughs]

200
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,422
[The Duke laughing]

201
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,329
Ah...

202
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,806
Mom! Dad!

203
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,041
Wake me up!

204
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,742
This is where I come in!

205
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,345
Ow!

206
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:20,446
Yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!

207
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,050
You'll pay for this, Patou!

208
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:25,551
This does not concern you.

209
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,186
It does if it's
about Chanti!

210
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,455
The light! Owls hate the light!

211
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:35,027
[screams]

212
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,265
Whew!

213
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,535
Hey, boy.

214
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:45,071
We were this close!

215
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:49,041
Oh, that flashlight biz was
quick thinking on your part!

216
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,776
What's your name,
little fella?

217
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,178
Edmond.

218
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,212
Is he gone?

219
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,980
Yeah, he's gone,
but he'll be back.

220
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,916
And he won't be alone,
the coward.

221
00:11:56,982 --> 00:12:00,619
I would have whopped him
if I'd of had my shoes tied!

222
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,088
But you know something?

223
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:05,124
Tying shoes is harder
than dry dog food.

224
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,293
What you wearing shoes for?

225
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,427
Bunions!

226
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,930
I got a load of bunions.

227
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:13,432
And them shoes
help my feet.

228
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:16,402
Here, let me show you
how to tie them.

229
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,604
Oh, jeepers!

230
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,005
I'm all furry!

231
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,574
Well, kittens are furry.

232
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,477
But, but I'm a little boy!

233
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:26,011
[meows]

234
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,115
Did that come out of me?

235
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,517
Oh! I'm... I'm a cat!

236
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,153
He turned me into a cat!
Help me!

237
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,522
Do something!
I can't be a cat!

238
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,723
I'm a boy!

239
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,225
Patou, what will I do?

240
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,027
Alright, steady, boy,
keep your pants on.

241
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,829
[gasps]

242
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:58,010
Yuck! What am I doing?
I'm licking myself!

243
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:02,214
[Peepers] Patou!

244
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,315
I'm in here!

245
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:07,253
According to my calculations,

246
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,421
this can't possibly
be the city.

247
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:12,525
Let's see,
36 by 7 southeast...

248
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:14,894
Thirty-six by 77...

249
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,129
Or is it 37 by 6?

250
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:18,931
[gasps]

251
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,933
[chuckles]

252
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,002
It's okay, Peepers!

253
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:25,638
It's Edmond,
he's a nice kid.

254
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:26,805
I'm a boy!

255
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:28,507
And I almost
ate a mouse!

256
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:29,875
I must be crazy!

257
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,111
You bet your
sweet whiskers!

258
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:35,214
Wow!

259
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,815
[Stuey]
There's no city around here.

260
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,218
Oh, sadness!

261
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:42,555
Hey, aren't you going to
tie my shoes?

262
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:43,889
I can't!

263
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:47,092
I can't help anybody!
I'm too little!

264
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,796
I'm a scrawny fur-ball runt!

265
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:53,899
Mom and Dad
won't even recognize me!

266
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,435
Mom! Dad!

267
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,903
Help!

268
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,139
[thunder crashes]

269
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:04,543
Oh, Chanticleer.

270
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,046
If he doesn't
come back and crow,

271
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:09,215
the sun won't ever shine again,

272
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:11,250
and the rain
will keep coming down,

273
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,118
and the water will
get higher and higher,

274
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:16,956
until we all drown.

275
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,559
Wowee wow wow wow!

276
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,294
Are we close?
Are we near the city?

277
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,129
Us magpies are just
made for the city!

278
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,998
Come on, already!
Hurry it up, Peepers!

279
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:27,366
We're not looking
for the city!

280
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,401
We're looking
for Chanticleer.

281
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,670
Well, he's in the city,
isn't he?

282
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:33,038
Then he is in the city!

283
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,607
Girls, they think
they know everything!

284
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,709
Why don't you run home,
be a mousewife? Make cheese?

285
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:39,345
[lisps] Snipes, you think
you're so superior!

286
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:41,146
"Thuperior!"
Nithe lithp!

287
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,183
My lisp isolates
and elevates me

288
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,585
and makes me
a rare specimen.

289
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,188
[Snipes and Peepers argue]

290
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,889
Pipe down, you two!

291
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,291
The story's true!

292
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,927
You all laughed at him,
and he went away!

293
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,263
You're right, son.
We done wrong!

294
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:00,032
And that's why we're searching
for the city.

295
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,868
We got to find Chanti
and apologize.

296
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,203
So he'll forgive us.

297
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,739
Come home
and raise the sun!

298
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,674
Well, I know where the city is.

299
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,310
I've been there
lots of times as a boy.

300
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,511
A boy?

301
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,847
Before that big owl
turned me into a cat!

302
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:16,949
Owl? Owl?

303
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:20,386
Edmond, would you take us
to the city?

304
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:21,920
I can't.

305
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:24,256
Look at me,
I'm a cat.

306
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,659
No, a little kitty.

307
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,127
What can I do?

308
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,896
I can do lots of things,

309
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,631
and I'm a lot smaller
than you.

310
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:33,932
And furthermore,

311
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,602
I could forgive you
for being a cat

312
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,470
if you would take us
to the city.

313
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,506
Of course,
if you're a fraidy-cat--

314
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,007
I'm not afraid!

315
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,876
Or a scaredy-cat.

316
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:45,144
Me, scared?

317
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,579
Lay off the boy!

318
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:48,747
Hey, guys! Guys!

319
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,483
Okay, okay!
I'm not afraid of anything!

320
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,220
I'll take you to the city
to find Chanticleer!

321
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:58,057
And bring him home,

322
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,727
and save Dad and Mom
and the farm!

323
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:02,995
[all] Hurray!

324
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,897
Hope you can swim, guys.

325
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,198
[Edmond] Oh, no!

326
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,803
[coughing]

327
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:11,737
Ahhh!

328
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,238
We don't have to swim!

329
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,307
We'll go by boat!

330
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:19,111
Oh, this is serious!

331
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:22,881
Peepers, you'll need this
if those owls return!

332
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:25,884
Owls? Owls? Owls?

333
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,586
I'm sticking with you!

00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,389
-Well, fellas, this is it!

Goodbye!
Good luck with the owls!

338
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,132
Owls?

339
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,638
[Patou] Yep, owls.

340
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:49,308
While Edmond set our course
for the city

341
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,543
in the U.S.S. Toybox,

342
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,513
the Duke and his owls
were back in their lair

343
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,216
storing up some
powerful nasty weather...

344
00:16:57,282 --> 00:17:00,486
[organ music plays]

345
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,264
So he turns on the Duke.

346
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,899
And with what,
do you suppose,

347
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,868
he turns on the Duke?

348
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,002
[all] What, master?

349
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,437

Alienation!

1249
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:10,466
Anticipation!

1250
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:12,769
Altercation! Wow!

1251
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:23,946
[Patou] Well, our journey
had finally come to an end.

1252
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:26,849
Old Chanticleer
was back to stay,

1253
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:28,518
the sun was up,

1254
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:29,886
the rain had stopped,

1255
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:34,057
and the owls
were gone for good.

1256
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:37,460
Everything seemed to be
turning out just fine.

1257
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:40,763
Except for one thing...

1258
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:43,933
Edmond.

1259
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,335
We just didn't know
how to help him.

1260
01:02:07,723 --> 01:02:09,926
He was a little boy!

1261
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:15,431
Oh, he was
a handsome little boy.

1262
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:17,333
Edmond...

1263
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:21,104
Edmond...

1264
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:26,275
-Edmond...
-[Mother] Edmond...

1265
01:02:26,342 --> 01:02:27,910
Edmond...

1266
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:31,514
Edmond...

1267
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:38,221
Edmond...

1268
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:41,023
Edmond, come on, honey,
wake up.

1269
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:51,234
Wake up, honey.

1270
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:54,670
Mom... Mom!

1271
01:02:54,737 --> 01:02:55,705
[gasps]

1272
01:02:55,771 --> 01:02:58,374
Look, I'm not furry anymore!

1273
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:01,043
Lie down, sweetheart.

1274
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:04,347
-Mom, is that the sun?
-Mmm-hmm.

1275
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:06,215
Edmond...

1276
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,451
Edmond, get back
into bed.

1277
01:03:09,152 --> 01:03:10,386
Wow!

1278
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:13,055
Okay, take a look.

1279
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:15,858
Look, Mom,
Chanticleer raised the sun!

1280
01:03:15,925 --> 01:03:17,994
Hi, Edmond!
How ya doing, son?

1281
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:21,430
[Edmond]
Fine! But what happened
to Chanti and the gang?

1282
01:03:21,497 --> 01:03:22,899
Mom, where are they?

1283
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:26,035
Edmond, Chanticleer
is just a storybook.

1284
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:28,137
Those characters
are only make-believe!

1285
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:29,405
Now, come on,
let's get back into bed.

1286
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:32,208
No, mom! No, they're not!
I saw them!

1287
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:34,343
I bet they're wondering
what happened to me.

1288
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:36,179
I want to
tell them I'm okay.

1289
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:38,681
-I'm sure they know.
-You think so?

1290
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:39,916
Mmm-hmm.

1291
01:03:42,518 --> 01:03:43,920
They'll be just fine.

1292
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:46,088
[Patou]
Edmond's mom was right,
of course,

1293
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:47,890
but she didn't know why.

1294
01:03:47,957 --> 01:03:51,861
She also never knew just what
stopped the rain that night.

1295
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:53,496
But that just
goes to show you,

1296
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:55,731
with a little help
from your friends,

1297
01:03:55,798 --> 01:03:57,700
you can do just
about anything.

1298
01:03:57,767 --> 01:04:00,236
Welcome home, Chanticleer.

1299
01:04:00,303 --> 01:04:03,039
