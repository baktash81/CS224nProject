1
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,270
This global warming is killing me.

2
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:18,350
This is too hot,
the Ice Age was too cold.

3
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,440
What would it take to make you happy?

4
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,110
This I like.

5
00:03:59,268 --> 00:04:01,978
Oh, no, you won't catch me.

6
00:04:08,358 --> 00:04:11,318
No running, James. Camp rules.

7
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:15,618
Make me, sloth.

8
00:04:15,698 --> 00:04:19,038
Make me, sir. It's all about respect.

9
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,747
Water ball.

10
00:04:22,837 --> 00:04:25,212
Sammy, you just ate. Wait an hour.

11
00:04:25,247 --> 00:04:27,757
Hector, no, no, no,
you can't pee-pee there.

12
00:04:27,837 --> 00:04:30,757
OK, there is fine.
Ashley, stop picking your...

13
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,427
Pinata!

14
00:04:32,507 --> 00:04:35,717
Stop! You're supposed to wear blindfolds.

15
00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:37,727
OK.

16
00:04:37,807 --> 00:04:40,437
- Hey, it's my turn to hit the sloth.
- Mine.

17
00:04:40,517 --> 00:04:42,517
- Mine.
- Mine.

18
00:04:48,027 --> 00:04:50,656
Hey, you didn't have any candy in you.

19
00:04:50,736 --> 00:04:53,116
- Let's bury him.
- Yeah!

20
00:04:57,946 --> 00:05:01,036
Hey, whoa. Who said you kids
could torture the sloth?

21
00:05:01,116 --> 00:05:03,916
Manny, don't squash their creativity.

22
00:05:03,996 --> 00:05:07,916
Hey, Manny, Diego,
my bad mammals-jammals.

23
00:05:08,006 --> 00:05:10,126
Wanna give a sloth a hand?

24
00:05:11,676 --> 00:05:16,425
Look, I opened my camp.
"Campo del Sid". It means Camp of Sid.

25
00:05:16,505 --> 00:05:20,385
Congratulations.
You're now an idiot in two languages.

26
00:05:20,475 --> 00:05:25,145
Not in front of the k-i-d-z.
These little guys love me. Right, Billy?

27
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:27,475
Don't make me eat you.

28
00:05:27,565 --> 00:05:30,775
They kid. That's why they're called kids.

29
00:05:30,855 --> 00:05:34,655
I told you, Sid.
You're not qualified to run a camp.

30
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:37,485
What do qualifications
have to do with childcare?

31
00:05:37,575 --> 00:05:42,115
Besides, these kids look up to me.
I'm a role model to them.

32
00:05:43,574 --> 00:05:45,994
I can see that.

33
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:50,584
You guys never think I can do anything,
but I'm an equal member of this herd.

34
00:05:50,664 --> 00:05:56,254
I made this herd, so you need
to start treating me with some respect.

35
00:05:58,054 --> 00:06:01,344
- Come on, Sid.
- Sid, we were just kidding.

36
00:06:01,424 --> 00:06:04,394
Hey, let's play
pin-the-tail-on-the-mammoth.

37
00:06:04,429 --> 00:06:05,934
Yeah!

38
00:06:06,474 --> 00:06:07,974
Sid!

39
00:06:08,064 --> 00:06:10,064
I can do stuff.

40
00:06:11,183 --> 00:06:14,193
Won't give me their stupid respect.

41
00:06:17,773 --> 00:06:19,363
I'll show 'em.

42
00:06:20,403 --> 00:06:26,243
And so, in the end,
the little burro reached his mommy.

43
00:06:26,323 --> 00:06:29,333
And they lived happily ever after.

44
00:06:32,043 --> 00:06:34,333
- Good job.
- Question.

45
00:06:34,423 --> 00:06:37,883
Why does the burro go home?
Why doesn't he stay with the rabbits?

46
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:41,842
Because... because he wanted
to be with his family.

47
00:06:41,922 --> 00:06:45,302
He should go with the girl burro.
That's a better love story.

48
00:06:45,382 --> 00:06:49,012
OK, well, when you tell your burro story,
that's what he'll do.

49
00:06:49,102 --> 00:06:53,022
Burro is a demeaning name.
Technically, it's called a wild ass.

50
00:06:53,102 --> 00:06:57,812
Fine. The wild ass boy
came home to his wild ass mother.

51
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:01,902
See, that's why I called it a burro.

52
00:07:03,362 --> 00:07:06,991
Could the burro have a grazing problem?
Then he'd be more relatable.

53
00:07:07,071 --> 00:07:09,581
- Boring.
- It's not believable.

54
00:07:09,661 --> 00:07:12,201
- Do burros eat their young?
- It's not a good ending.

55
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,621
Sometimes I throw up.

56
00:07:15,251 --> 00:07:19,711
They lived happily ever after.
You can't get more satisfying than that.

57
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:23,711
One big, happy family.
That's the way it's supposed to be.

58
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:26,471
Where's your big, happy family?

59
00:07:31,261 --> 00:07:35,520
Then the hungry tiger
ate the pesky little kids.

60
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,980
- You OK, buddy?
- Sure. Why not?

61
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,610
- I thought...
- Story time's over. The end.

62
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,990
- Run for your lives!
- Where's everybody going?

63
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,160
- The world's coming to an end.
- What are you talking about?

64
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,540
Fast Tony - he says
the world's gonna flood.

65
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,330
Folks, I hold in my hand
a device so powerful,

66
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,750
it can actually pull air
right out of the sky.

67
00:07:57,785 --> 00:07:58,830
Yeah, right.

68
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,289
Gather round, gather round.

69
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:03,879
Pardon me, do you have gills, ma'am?

70
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:06,509
So you can't breathe underwater?

71
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:08,929
My assistant here will demonstrate.

72
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:11,469
Hey, I can smell the ocean.

73
00:08:11,549 --> 00:08:14,809
What are you doing?
I can't sell that now.

74
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:17,809
You suck air through your mouth,
you moron.

75
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:21,019
Through its design
and sturdy construction,

76
00:08:21,054 --> 00:08:24,149
you'll have plenty of air
for eons to come.

77
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,939
Of course, results may vary.

78
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:31,068
Why are you scaring everybody
with this doomsday stuff?

79
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:33,988
I'm trying to make a living here, pal.

80
00:08:35,368 --> 00:08:39,578
It's my weather forecast. The five-day
outlook calls for intense flooding

81
00:08:39,668 --> 00:08:42,248
followed by the end of the world.

82
00:08:43,088 --> 00:08:46,128
And a slight chance of patchy sunshine
later in the week.

83
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:51,008
Come on, don't listen to him. Fast Tony
would sell his own mother for a grape.

84
00:08:51,088 --> 00:08:55,677
Are you making an offer?
I mean, no, I would not.

85
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:58,307
Haven't you heard? The ice is melting.

86
00:08:58,387 --> 00:09:00,727
You see this ground,
it's covered in ice.

87
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:03,227
A thousand years ago,
it was covered in ice.

88
00:09:03,307 --> 00:09:06,067
A thousand years from now,
it will still be ice.

89
00:09:06,147 --> 00:09:10,487
Say, buddy, not to cast aspersions
on your survival instincts or nothing,

90
00:09:10,567 --> 00:09:13,867
but haven't mammoths
pretty much gone extinct?

91
00:09:13,947 --> 00:09:18,037
- What are you talking about?
- About you being the last of your kind.

92
00:09:18,117 --> 00:09:20,957
Your breath smells like ants.

93
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:28,416
Be that as it may, when's the last time
you saw another mammoth?

94
00:09:29,506 --> 00:09:31,506
Don't pay any attention to him.

95
00:09:31,586 --> 00:09:34,596
Mammoths can't go extinct.
They're the biggest things on Earth.

96
00:09:34,676 --> 00:09:36,601
What about the dinosaurs?

97
00:09:36,636 --> 00:09:39,056
The dinosaurs got cocky
and made enemies.

98
00:09:39,136 --> 00:09:42,436
Look. Some idiot's
going down the Eviscerator.

99
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:45,566
Please tell me that's not our idiot.

100
00:09:46,226 --> 00:09:50,895
OK, I'm gonna jump
on the count of three.

101
00:09:52,105 --> 00:09:54,115
One,

102
00:09:54,815 --> 00:09:56,025
two...

103
00:09:56,115 --> 00:09:59,575
Sid, don't move a muscle.
We're coming up.

104
00:09:59,655 --> 00:10:01,405
Jump! Jump! Jump!

105
00:10:01,615 --> 00:10:03,615
Jump! Jump! Jump!

106
00:10:03,705 --> 00:10:05,205
Sorry.

107
00:10:05,285 --> 00:10:09,045
Two and three one-thousandths,
two and four one-thousandths...

108
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,795
Sid, what are you doing?
Get down from there.

109
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,795
No. I'm gonna be the first
to jump off the Eviscerator

110
00:10:14,885 --> 00:10:18,254
and then you guys are gonna have to
show me some respect.

111
00:10:18,344 --> 00:10:21,514
The only respect you'll get
is respect for the dead.

112
00:10:21,594 --> 00:10:24,594
Come on, Manny, he's not that stupid.

113
00:10:25,644 --> 00:10:29,104
- But I've been wrong before.
- Geronimo!

114
00:10:32,734 --> 00:10:34,604
Hey, watch it.

115
00:10:40,444 --> 00:10:45,454
I can't breathe.
I think I just coughed up my spleen.

116
00:10:59,753 --> 00:11:04,633
- Diego, retract the claws, please.
- Right. Sorry.

117
00:11:04,723 --> 00:11:09,143
If I didn't know you better, Diego,
I'd think you were afraid of the water.

118
00:11:09,223 --> 00:11:11,773
OK, OK. Good thing I know you better.

119
00:11:11,853 --> 00:11:13,482
Guys.

120
00:11:13,562 --> 00:11:15,732
Fast Tony was right.

121
00:11:16,852 --> 00:11:19,482
Everything is melting.

122
00:11:44,091 --> 00:11:48,431
It's all gonna flood.
Come on, we gotta warn them.

123
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:51,431
Maybe we can rapidly evolve
into water creatures.

124
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:55,641
- That's genius, Sid.
- Call me Squid.

125
00:11:56,981 --> 00:12:02,401
This whole thing's a piece of junk.
I can't believe I live here.

126
00:12:03,901 --> 00:12:05,401
What?

127
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:16,000
Forget reeds. I present you with this
revolutionary gizmo we call bark.

128
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:21,420
- It's so buoyant, it actually floats.
- I'll show you something that floats.

129
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,590
All right, it's your funeral.

130
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,889
See? This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

131
00:12:36,979 --> 00:12:40,939
Giants balls of furry lava the size of
mammoths raining from the sky.

132
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:43,779
Go suck air through a reed.

133
00:12:43,859 --> 00:12:47,239
Listen to him.
He's right about the flood.

134
00:12:47,274 --> 00:12:49,409
I am? I mean, yes, I am.

135
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:54,079
Wait. You said there wasn't going to be
a flood. Why should we listen to you?

136
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,209
Because we saw what's up there.
The dam's gonna break.

137
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,209
The entire valley's gonna flood.

138
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:06,418
Flood's real, all right.
And it's coming fast.

139
00:13:06,508 --> 00:13:09,588
Look around. You're in a bowl.

140
00:13:10,888 --> 00:13:14,888
Bowl's gonna fill up. Ain't no way out.

141
00:13:15,718 --> 00:13:17,893
What are we gonna do?

142
00:13:17,928 --> 00:13:20,598
Unless you make it
to the end of the valley.

143
00:13:20,688 --> 00:13:23,438
There's a boat. It can save you.

144
00:13:23,518 --> 00:13:26,478
- I don't see anything.
- But

145
00:13:26,568 --> 00:13:28,898
y'all better hurry.

146
00:13:28,988 --> 00:13:33,487
Ground's melting,
walls tumbling, rocks crumbling.

147
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,577
Survive that
and you'll be racing the water,

148
00:13:36,657 --> 00:13:40,997
cos in three days' time,
it's gonna hit the geyser fields.

149
00:13:41,077 --> 00:13:43,077
Boom!

150
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:46,747
There is some good news, though.

151
00:13:46,837 --> 00:13:48,877
The more of you die,

152
00:13:48,967 --> 00:13:50,967
the better I eat.

153
00:13:52,257 --> 00:13:55,757
I didn't say it was good news for you.

154
00:13:58,926 --> 00:14:02,686
He must have been
a real pleasure to have in class.

155
00:14:26,745 --> 00:14:28,375
Dam.

156
00:14:28,795 --> 00:14:33,215
All right, you heard the scary vulture.
Let's move out.

157
00:14:33,295 --> 00:14:35,795
Manny, you really think there's a boat?

158
00:14:35,885 --> 00:14:39,515
I don't know, but in a few days,
this place is gonna be underwater.

159
00:14:39,595 --> 00:14:42,595
If there's any hope, it's that way.

160
00:15:03,244 --> 00:15:05,414
Manny, let's go.

161
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:29,158
Overturned glyptodont
in the far right lane.

162
00:15:29,193 --> 00:15:31,723
Traffic backed up
as far as the eye can see.

163
00:15:31,813 --> 00:15:35,353
And it looks like
there might be a fatality.

164
00:15:35,443 --> 00:15:37,403
I call the dark meat.

165
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:43,613
Come on, everybody, let's go.
Come on, come, come, come. Get in.

166
00:15:44,493 --> 00:15:48,033
- Come on, Grandpa, come on.
- We have to go.

167
00:15:48,122 --> 00:15:54,122
Well, I'm not leaving. I was born
in this hole and I'll die in this hole.

168
00:16:00,962 --> 00:16:03,632
Do we have to bring this crap?

169
00:16:03,722 --> 00:16:09,052
- I'm sure there's crap where we're going.
- This was a gift from my mother.

170
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:11,182
OK, keep it moving, keep it moving.

171
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:14,062
Manny,
I just heard you're going extinct.

172
00:16:14,142 --> 00:16:18,061
Hey, if you ever master hygiene,
try working on sensitivity.

173
00:16:18,151 --> 00:16:23,651
- I'm not going extinct.
- Kids, look. The last mammoth.

174
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:28,741
Well, you probably won't see
another one of those again.

175
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,071
See?

176
00:16:30,161 --> 00:16:33,791
OK, one, two, three... Where is James?

177
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:14,659
Stu. Come on, Stu.

178
00:17:14,739 --> 00:17:17,499
Let's blow this ice-cube stand.

179
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,629
Stu.

180
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:31,469
Folks, be the first in the valley
to have your very own mobile home.

181
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,474
- Shut up, Sid.
- OK.

182
00:19:52,564 --> 00:19:54,894
Stop singing, Sid.

183
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:03,743
Sid, I'm going to fall on you again
and this time I will kill you.

184
00:20:03,823 --> 00:20:07,033
OK, someone doesn't like the classics.

185
00:20:17,753 --> 00:20:19,843
What if you're right?

186
00:20:19,923 --> 00:20:21,923
What if I am the last mammoth?

187
00:20:22,003 --> 00:20:25,302
But Manny, look at the bright side,
you have us.

188
00:20:25,382 --> 00:20:28,762
Not your most persuasive argument, Sid.

189
00:20:32,852 --> 00:20:35,482
- Mammoths?
- I knew I couldn't be the last one.

190
00:20:35,562 --> 00:20:38,062
I felt it in my gut.

191
00:20:49,572 --> 00:20:51,741
Extinct? Come on.

192
00:20:55,331 --> 00:20:58,421
He's up by a couple of fifths,
ahead by a tusk.

193
00:20:58,501 --> 00:21:02,461
And he's beating Diego
as Diego's coming round the corner.

194
00:21:09,261 --> 00:21:13,181
Sorry. My stomach hates me.

195
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:19,600
Well, don't that put
the "stink" in extinction?

196
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,320
Nasty.

197
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,150
Manny.

198
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,570
I need to be alone for a while.

199
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,450
You go on ahead. I'll catch up.

200
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,340
One truly is the loneliest number.

201
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,129
These work great.

202
00:21:50,929 --> 00:21:52,799
Cool.

203
00:21:53,929 --> 00:21:57,809
- Missed me, now you gotta kiss me.
- I'll get 'em.

204
00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:02,109
- Which end is up?
- I'd hide that face too.

205
00:22:02,479 --> 00:22:06,029
- Hey, ugly.
- I gotta sit on that.

206
00:22:10,699 --> 00:22:12,279
Gotcha.

207
00:22:18,998 --> 00:22:20,958
OK, I'm going in.

208
00:22:21,828 --> 00:22:24,168
- Sid.
- What?

209
00:22:24,248 --> 00:22:26,048
- Nice miss.
- Cover your side.

210
00:22:26,128 --> 00:22:29,008
- I felt some breeze in that one.
- Smile.

211
00:22:33,928 --> 00:22:36,348
- Out of my way.
- Hello.

212
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:38,888
Over here.

213
00:22:40,518 --> 00:22:42,267
- Surrender?
- Never.

214
00:22:42,347 --> 00:22:44,057
Cool.

215
00:22:44,727 --> 00:22:46,227
Smoke them.

216
00:22:53,197 --> 00:22:58,287
If anyone asks, there were 50 of 'em
and they were rattlesnakes.

217
00:22:58,947 --> 00:23:01,997
- Here, kitty, kitty.
- Big mistake, you miscreants.

218
00:23:02,077 --> 00:23:04,577
Miscreants?

219
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,957
Diego, they're possums.

220
00:23:10,376 --> 00:23:12,376
Retreat.

221
00:23:38,325 --> 00:23:40,995
I guess it's just you and me now.

222
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:55,795
I knew it.
I knew I wasn't the only one.

223
00:23:55,885 --> 00:24:00,005
Everyone falls out of the tree now
and then. They just don't admit it.

224
00:24:00,095 --> 00:24:01,675
Wait. What?

225
00:24:01,765 --> 00:24:04,434
Some of us have a tough time
holding on to branches.

226
00:24:04,514 --> 00:24:08,604
It's not like we're bats or something.
We don't have wings to keep us up.

227
00:24:08,684 --> 00:24:12,894
And you were in the tree because...?

228
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:16,404
I was looking for my brothers.
They are always in trouble.

229
00:24:16,484 --> 00:24:19,024
Brothers? You mean there's more?

230
00:24:19,114 --> 00:24:21,114
Sure.

231
00:24:21,904 --> 00:24:23,994
- There's lots of us.
- Where?

232
00:24:24,824 --> 00:24:28,204
Everywhere.
Under rocks. In holes in the ground.

233
00:24:28,284 --> 00:24:31,493
Usually we come out at night
so birds don't carry us off.

234
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:33,753
Help! Help!

235
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:35,833
Help!

236
00:24:40,043 --> 00:24:44,383
Well, shave me down and call me
a mole rat. You found another mammoth.

237
00:24:44,473 --> 00:24:48,183
Where? Wait a minute.
I thought mammoths were extinct.

238
00:24:49,853 --> 00:24:54,603
- What are you looking at me for?
- I don't know. Because you're a mammoth.

239
00:24:54,683 --> 00:24:59,232
Me? Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not a mammoth. I'm a possum.

240
00:24:59,312 --> 00:25:03,322
Right. Good one. I'm a newt.
This is my friend, the badger.

241
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:05,452
And my other friend, the platypus.

242
00:25:05,532 --> 00:25:09,202
Why do I gotta be the platypus?
Make him the platypus.

243
00:25:09,282 --> 00:25:12,582
- This guy giving you trouble, sis?
- Sis?

244
00:25:12,662 --> 00:25:17,752
That's right. These are my brothers.
Possum, possum, possum.

245
00:25:18,252 --> 00:25:22,882
I don't think her tree
goes all the way to the top branch.

246
00:25:24,212 --> 00:25:27,221
Manny, brink of extinction's
a bad time to be picky.

247
00:25:27,301 --> 00:25:29,511
Hey, she should come with us.

248
00:25:29,591 --> 00:25:32,181
Are you insane? No way.

249
00:25:32,261 --> 00:25:33,811
OK.

250
00:25:33,891 --> 00:25:37,981
Manny wants me to ask you
if you'd like to escape the flood with us.

251
00:25:38,061 --> 00:25:41,521
- I'd rather be road kill.
- That can be arranged.

252
00:25:41,611 --> 00:25:46,191
Funny. Let me have a little word
with my brothers.

253
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:49,281
Ellie, are you crazy?
We're not going with them.

254
00:25:49,361 --> 00:25:52,701
Look, we'll never make it in time
if we only travel at night.

255
00:25:52,781 --> 00:25:57,210
These guys can protect us out in the open.
What do you say?

256
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,120
Why did you invite them?

257
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:03,420
Cos you might be
the only two mammoths left on Earth.

258
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,765
He has a point.

259
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,800
Sorry, when did I join
this dating service?

260
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,140
My brothers and I
would be delighted to come with you.

261
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,510
If you treat us nicely.

262
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,180
See that?
That's the total opposite of nice.

263
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,940
Maybe we'll have a snack
before we hit the road.

264
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:23,189
You want a piece of us? Let's go.

265
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:25,069
Banzai!

266
00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:27,569
- I got 'em.
- Back! Back!

267
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,529
You know the best part?
We're carrying diseases.

268
00:26:39,249 --> 00:26:43,039
OK, thanks to Sid,
we're now travelling together.

269
00:26:43,129 --> 00:26:46,839
And like it or not,
we're going to be one big, happy family.

270
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:49,758
I'll be the daddy,
Ellie will be the mommy.

271
00:26:49,838 --> 00:26:53,758
And Diego will be the uncle
who eats the kids who get on my nerves.

272
00:26:53,848 --> 00:26:57,718
Now, let's move it before the ground
falls out from under our feet.

273
00:26:57,808 --> 00:27:00,728
I thought fat guys
were supposed to be jolly.

274
00:27:00,808 --> 00:27:05,018
I'm not fat. It's this fur,
it makes me look big.

275
00:27:05,108 --> 00:27:08,028
- It's poofy.
- OK.

276
00:27:08,108 --> 00:27:10,278
He's fat.

277
00:27:44,516 --> 00:27:48,606
Escaping the flood is the perfect time
to shed those unsightly pounds

278
00:27:48,686 --> 00:27:51,526
with Fast Tony's Disaster Diet.

279
00:27:53,396 --> 00:27:56,776
You, ma'am, you look
like a big, fat, hairy beast.

280
00:27:56,866 --> 00:27:59,866
How would you like
to lose a ton or two?

281
00:27:59,946 --> 00:28:01,536
Would I ever.

282
00:28:01,616 --> 00:28:06,376
Don't listen to him, Vera.
You're already thin as a twig.

283
00:28:06,456 --> 00:28:11,505
I also have the perfect cure
for your eyesight, my blind friend.

284
00:28:40,864 --> 00:28:42,864
We'll never make it at this pace.

285
00:28:42,944 --> 00:28:47,374
Ellie, it's OK, you can
lose the camouflage. You're safe.

286
00:28:47,454 --> 00:28:50,334
OK. Safe? Please.

287
00:28:50,414 --> 00:28:52,454
Crash, Eddie, you two go scope it out.

288
00:28:52,544 --> 00:28:54,754
- What you got?
- Perimeter all clear.

289
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:59,794
- Roger that. One-niner, over.
- Roger, over, victor...

290
00:28:59,884 --> 00:29:01,754
- Guys.
- All clear.

291
00:29:08,303 --> 00:29:10,053
Hawk!

292
00:29:17,353 --> 00:29:20,773
- What are you doing?
- Playing dead.

293
00:29:21,273 --> 00:29:25,193
- Manny, why don't you do that?
- Because I'm a mammoth.

294
00:29:25,283 --> 00:29:27,663
But you'd do it for treats, right?

295
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,783
Is he gone?

296
00:29:33,082 --> 00:29:35,162
You're safe. Get up.

297
00:29:36,212 --> 00:29:37,332
Man.

298
00:29:37,422 --> 00:29:41,882
If you weren't here, that hawk would have
swooped down and snatched me for dinner.

299
00:29:41,962 --> 00:29:44,632
That's how cousin Wilton went.

300
00:29:47,762 --> 00:29:50,052
Boy, I really feel for you. I do.

301
00:29:50,142 --> 00:29:54,432
I can't even imagine what it'd be like
to be the last one of your species.

302
00:29:54,522 --> 00:29:58,982
- I'm not the last one.
- You brave, brave soul.

303
00:29:59,062 --> 00:30:02,071
That's right. Don't give up hope.

304
00:30:03,571 --> 00:30:05,611
Ellie.

305
00:30:05,691 --> 00:30:08,531
Look at our footprints.

306
00:30:08,611 --> 00:30:10,871
They're the same shape.

307
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:14,081
Well, how do I know
those aren't your footprints?

308
00:30:14,161 --> 00:30:16,201
Well, then,

309
00:30:16,291 --> 00:30:18,581
look at our shadows.

310
00:30:18,661 --> 00:30:20,961
We match.

311
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:23,751
You're right. They're the same.

312
00:30:23,841 --> 00:30:26,011
You must be part possum.

313
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,180
You wish.

314
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:47,490
Diego, there are whole continents
moving faster than you.

315
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:50,570
We gotta catch up with the others.

316
00:30:58,869 --> 00:31:01,209
Hey. Knock it off.

317
00:31:03,709 --> 00:31:07,549
Cry me a river, blubber-tooth tiger.
Have some fun.

318
00:31:07,629 --> 00:31:10,799
The ice is thin enough
without you two wearing it down.

319
00:31:10,879 --> 00:31:13,049
Diego, come on. The ice may be thin,

320
00:31:13,139 --> 00:31:19,019
but it's strong enough to hold
a ten-ton mammoth and a nine-ton possum.

321
00:31:41,368 --> 00:31:43,328
Mammal overboard!

322
00:31:57,637 --> 00:32:01,387
Ellie, get up.
If you play dead, you'll be dead.

323
00:32:01,477 --> 00:32:03,517
Look at me.

324
00:32:10,027 --> 00:32:12,067
Diego.

325
00:32:20,076 --> 00:32:21,446
Diego.

326
00:32:31,006 --> 00:32:33,216
Come on, Diego. Come on.

327
00:32:34,796 --> 00:32:37,506
This may sting a little.

328
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:45,363
- What in the animal kingdom was that?
- I don't know.

329
00:33:45,453 --> 00:33:49,323
From now on,
land - safe, water - not safe.

330
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:58,293
That was the bravest thing
I've ever seen.

331
00:33:58,373 --> 00:34:01,293
- It was nothing. I...
- It's not a compliment.

332
00:34:01,383 --> 00:34:03,423
To a possum, bravery is just dumb.

333
00:34:03,503 --> 00:34:06,473
- Yeah, we're spineless.
- Lily-livered.

334
00:34:06,553 --> 00:34:09,972
Maybe mammoths are going extinct
because they get in danger.

335
00:34:10,052 --> 00:34:13,062
Maybe you should run away more.

336
00:34:13,142 --> 00:34:15,432
Good point. Thanks for the advice.

337
00:34:15,522 --> 00:34:17,522
Happy to help.

338
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:22,942
Do you believe her? "Bravery is dumb.
Maybe you should run away more".

339
00:34:23,022 --> 00:34:26,112
She's infuriating
and stubborn and narrow-minded.

340
00:34:26,192 --> 00:34:28,452
You like her.

341
00:34:28,532 --> 00:34:33,082
- I do not.
- Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

342
00:34:33,162 --> 00:34:35,831
- And so is yours.
- What secret?

343
00:34:35,911 --> 00:34:38,661
You know, the one where you can't swim.

344
00:34:38,751 --> 00:34:40,046
That's ridiculous.

345
00:34:40,081 --> 00:34:42,541
Fine. But we're living
in a melting world.

346
00:34:42,631 --> 00:34:47,131
You're going to have to
face your fear sooner or later.

347
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,609
Almost there.

348
00:35:49,489 --> 00:35:51,859
- OK. Ready, Eddie?
- Set.

349
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:53,949
Let's roll.

350
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:58,488
Wait for me.

351
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:13,008
No brakes. Gotta roll.
Meet you at the other end.

352
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:16,008
So you think she's the girl for me?

353
00:36:16,098 --> 00:36:19,268
Yeah. She's tons of fun
and you're no fun at all.

354
00:36:19,348 --> 00:36:21,978
She completes you.

355
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:25,687
Yeah.

356
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:30,027
Hey, Manny. Can you pull back the tree
and shoot me into the pond?

357
00:36:30,107 --> 00:36:32,447
- No.
- Come on.

358
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,157
You expect to impress
with that attitude?

359
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:36,657
I don't want to impress.

360
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:39,617
Why are you trying
to convince her she's a mammoth?

361
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:43,367
Because that's what she is.
I don't care if she thinks she's a possum.

362
00:36:43,457 --> 00:36:47,837
<i>- You can't be two things.
- Au contraire, Man-fered.</i>

363
00:36:47,917 --> 00:36:50,587
Tell that to the bullfrog,
chicken hawk or turtledove.

364
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:53,011
He's never gonna let up on you.

365
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:56,676
It'll be easier on all of us
if you just go with it.

366
00:36:58,296 --> 00:37:00,641
So what do you want me to do?

367
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:03,136
Pull the tree
and shoot me into the pond.

368
00:37:03,226 --> 00:37:04,811
I don't know.

369
00:37:04,846 --> 00:37:07,766
If you're too lame to do it,
we can get Ellie.

370
00:37:07,856 --> 00:37:10,566
No, no, no. No, I can do it.
I can do it.

371
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:12,606
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, come on.

372
00:37:12,686 --> 00:37:16,406
- Have you done this before?
- Only a million times.

373
00:37:16,856 --> 00:37:19,026
Farther, farther, farther.

374
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:22,035
Perfect. Fire!

375
00:37:24,205 --> 00:37:26,575
Yeah! I can fly!

376
00:37:38,545 --> 00:37:40,295
Crash!

377
00:37:42,175 --> 00:37:44,725
Crash! Crash!

378
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:47,395
- Crash, are you OK?
- What happened?

379
00:37:47,475 --> 00:37:50,434
- Manny shot him out of a tree.
- What's wrong with you?

380
00:37:50,514 --> 00:37:53,854
- He said he could do it.
- And you listened to him?

381
00:37:53,934 --> 00:37:57,314
Crash, whatever you do,
don't go into the light.

382
00:37:57,404 --> 00:37:59,564
Can I help in any way here?

383
00:37:59,654 --> 00:38:02,614
You've done enough.

384
00:38:03,154 --> 00:38:07,534
- Are you happy now?
- Crash, Crash, don't leave me.

385
00:38:07,614 --> 00:38:09,994
Who's gonna watch my back?

386
00:38:10,074 --> 00:38:13,664
Who's gonna be my wingman of mayhem?

387
00:38:13,754 --> 00:38:18,003
Who's gonna roll
in that dung patch with me?

388
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:20,043
Dung patch?

389
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:24,883
- Wait. My legs. I can stand.
- He can stand.

390
00:38:24,963 --> 00:38:28,683
- I can run.
- He can run. It's a miracle.

391
00:38:28,763 --> 00:38:30,763
Hallelujah!

392
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:42,023
What can I say? They're boys.
They make my life a little adventure.

393
00:38:42,113 --> 00:38:45,362
You guys are so dead.
Thanks for embarrassing me.

394
00:38:45,442 --> 00:38:47,612
Not the face.

395
00:38:58,332 --> 00:39:00,672
Ellie, Ellie, me too.

396
00:39:00,752 --> 00:39:02,922
She's not half bad.

397
00:39:04,172 --> 00:39:07,672
Crazy and confused, but sweet.

398
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,762
So?

399
00:39:11,301 --> 00:39:13,811
So what's holding you back?

400
00:39:16,141 --> 00:39:18,141
My family.

401
00:39:21,691 --> 00:39:24,271
You can have that again, you know.

402
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:26,531
No, Sid, I can't.

403
00:39:27,861 --> 00:39:31,361
OK, OK, but think about it.
I mean, if you let this chance go,

404
00:39:31,451 --> 00:39:36,491
you're letting your whole species go
and that's just... that's just selfish.

405
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,500
I think I'm starting
to get through to him.

406
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,720
- Wait, wait. I got you.
- Slowpoke.

407
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:58,640
- Need help?
- No, no. Just catching my breath.

408
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,440
- You're stuck.
- I am not.

409
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,190
All right, then, let's go.

410
00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:07,529
I can't.

411
00:40:08,189 --> 00:40:09,819
I'm stuck.

412
00:40:09,899 --> 00:40:14,529
Don't you think that picking them up
like this would be easier?

413
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:32,759
Ellie?

414
00:40:55,448 --> 00:40:57,658
I know this place.

415
00:43:01,523 --> 00:43:05,533
You know, deep down,
I knew I was different.

416
00:43:08,113 --> 00:43:12,243
I was a little bigger
than the other possum kids.

417
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:14,833
OK, a lot bigger.

418
00:43:16,623 --> 00:43:20,632
Now I understand why the possum boys
didn't find me appealing.

419
00:43:20,712 --> 00:43:26,632
That's too bad,
because as far as mammoths go, you're,

420
00:43:26,712 --> 00:43:29,052
- you know.
- What?

421
00:43:33,642 --> 00:43:35,352
Attractive.

422
00:43:35,432 --> 00:43:38,522
- Really?
- Sure.

423
00:43:38,602 --> 00:43:41,852
What about me is attractive?

424
00:43:43,982 --> 00:43:45,981
I don't know.

425
00:43:46,071 --> 00:43:48,321
Well, there's your

426
00:43:49,741 --> 00:43:51,861
butt.

427
00:43:52,621 --> 00:43:55,031
What about it?

428
00:43:55,121 --> 00:43:57,251
It's

429
00:43:57,331 --> 00:43:59,581
big.

430
00:43:59,661 --> 00:44:01,791
You're just saying that.

431
00:44:02,381 --> 00:44:05,341
No, no, no, I mean it.

432
00:44:05,421 --> 00:44:09,671
It's huge.
Biggest darn butt I've ever seen.

433
00:44:09,761 --> 00:44:12,721
That is really sweet.

434
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:15,050
What a crazy day.

435
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:20,480
This morning I woke up a possum
and now I'm a mammoth.

436
00:46:06,786 --> 00:46:09,496
Boy, Manny sure took a big leap
with Ellie today.

437
00:46:09,586 --> 00:46:11,916
Sure did.

438
00:46:12,006 --> 00:46:16,796
He stood on the shore of uncertainty
and dove right in. Splash.

439
00:46:16,876 --> 00:46:20,346
Kind of brave, huh?
The way he faced his fear.

440
00:46:20,426 --> 00:46:23,636
I wouldn't know.
Sabres don't feel fear.

441
00:46:23,726 --> 00:46:28,266
Come on, all animals feel fear.
It's what separates us from, say, rocks.

442
00:46:28,346 --> 00:46:30,855
Rocks have no fear.

443
00:46:30,935 --> 00:46:34,435
- And they sink.
- What are you getting at, Sid?

444
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:39,405
It may surprise you to know
that I, too, have experienced fear.

445
00:46:39,485 --> 00:46:41,275
No. You?

446
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:43,905
Yeah. Yes, as impossible as it seems,

447
00:46:43,995 --> 00:46:49,665
the sloth has natural enemies that would
like to harm or otherwise "kill" us.

448
00:46:49,745 --> 00:46:52,495
- I wonder why?
- Jealousy, mostly.

449
00:46:52,585 --> 00:46:55,545
But the point is that fear is natural.

450
00:46:56,585 --> 00:46:59,214
Fear is for prey.

451
00:46:59,294 --> 00:47:03,004
Well, then, you're letting
the water make you its prey.

452
00:47:03,094 --> 00:47:07,014
Just jump in and trust your instincts.

453
00:47:07,094 --> 00:47:09,804
You know, most animals
can swim as babies.

454
00:47:09,894 --> 00:47:15,894
And for a tiger, it's like crawling
on your belly to stalk helpless prey.

455
00:47:16,604 --> 00:47:21,064
But faster, OK?
Now, claw, kick, claw, kick.

456
00:47:21,154 --> 00:47:24,154
I'm stalking the prey. Claw, kick.

457
00:47:24,234 --> 00:47:27,153
I look back over my shoulder
to see if I'm being followed.

458
00:47:27,243 --> 00:47:29,573
And I'm breathing.

459
00:47:29,663 --> 00:47:33,083
And I'm stalking
and I'm stalking and I'm...

460
00:47:34,493 --> 00:47:38,873
- I'm falling.
- Correction. You're sinking.

461
00:47:38,963 --> 00:47:41,463
Kind of like a rock.

462
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:49,053
Hey, do we do any special tricks
like roll over?

463
00:47:49,133 --> 00:47:52,223
Or do we just throw our weight around?

464
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:54,062
Whoops. Sorry.

465
00:47:54,142 --> 00:47:56,722
I don't know my own strength yet.

466
00:47:56,812 --> 00:48:01,192
Ellie, do you realize that now
we have a chance to save our species?

467
00:48:01,272 --> 00:48:05,942
- Really? How are we gonna do that?
- Well, you know...

468
00:48:06,032 --> 00:48:07,902
Did you just...?

469
00:48:07,992 --> 00:48:11,822
I'm not a mammoth for five minutes
and you're hitting on me?

470
00:48:11,912 --> 00:48:15,622
I wasn't saying...
Not right now. In time.

471
00:48:15,702 --> 00:48:18,332
I was just saying that
it's our responsibility.

472
00:48:18,367 --> 00:48:19,712
What?

473
00:48:19,792 --> 00:48:22,581
All right, that came out wrong. I...

474
00:48:22,671 --> 00:48:24,751
You're very pretty, but we just met...

475
00:48:24,841 --> 00:48:28,211
Responsibility?
Just doing your duty? Is that it?

476
00:48:28,301 --> 00:48:32,301
Ready to make the ultimate sacrifice
to save your species.

477
00:48:32,391 --> 00:48:38,141
I got some news for you. You're not saving
the species tonight or any other night.

478
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:51,990
- So, how did it go?
- Not bad.

479
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,910
OK, let's go.
We travelled with you all day,

480
00:48:59,945 --> 00:49:02,580
now you're coming with us at night.

481
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:04,830
But we can't see at night.

482
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,130
Then enjoy the flood.

483
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,920
I can't even look at him.

484
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:12,010
Pervert.

485
00:49:16,759 --> 00:49:21,769
Making friends everywhere you go.
Just making friends.

486
00:49:45,828 --> 00:49:49,088
- Watch out, there's a stump.
- Not anymore.

487
00:49:50,878 --> 00:49:53,418
I thought we could walk together.

488
00:49:53,508 --> 00:49:56,138
Crash,
ask the mammoth why he thinks that.

489
00:49:56,218 --> 00:49:59,508
She said she thinks you're a jerk
and to go away.

490
00:49:59,598 --> 00:50:01,598
She didn't say...

491
00:50:02,518 --> 00:50:05,518
Look, maybe if we spend more time...

492
00:50:05,598 --> 00:50:09,608
Tell him that I need
a little personal space right now.

493
00:50:09,688 --> 00:50:14,607
- She said go jump in a lake.
- And possums rule.

494
00:50:14,697 --> 00:50:17,697
- I can hear her, you know.
- What do you want? A medal?

495
00:50:29,417 --> 00:50:31,627
Stop moving.

496
00:50:34,877 --> 00:50:36,797
Thank you.

497
00:50:44,516 --> 00:50:46,596
Manny, Ellie. Lock trunks.

498
00:50:49,436 --> 00:50:51,516
Now!

499
00:50:55,946 --> 00:50:59,486
Crash, Eddie. Grab on to that ledge.

500
00:51:04,866 --> 00:51:08,415
- Funny. Now what's your real plan?
- Just do it.

501
00:51:08,495 --> 00:51:10,535
- Bye, Eddie.
- Bye, Crash.

502
00:51:10,625 --> 00:51:12,955
- Bye, Ellie.
- Go now.

503
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:21,095
I'm sorry if what I said before
offended you.

504
00:51:21,175 --> 00:51:23,715
What do you mean "if" it offended me?

505
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:27,435
That it offended her!

506
00:51:27,515 --> 00:51:30,355
I mean that, that it offended you.

507
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:36,894
- You just overreacted, that's all.
- What?

508
00:51:36,984 --> 00:51:39,854
- Take it back.
- There are other lives at stake here.

509
00:51:39,944 --> 00:51:42,234
- He's got a point.
- He's got nothing.

510
00:51:42,324 --> 00:51:45,194
- It was a misunderstanding.
- It was insensitive.

511
00:51:45,284 --> 00:51:48,074
- Apologize.
- Why me? She overreacted.

512
00:51:48,154 --> 00:51:50,414
- Just apologies.
- No.

513
00:51:50,494 --> 00:51:53,414
- Do it.
- OK, I'm sorry.

514
00:51:53,494 --> 00:51:54,954
What?

515
00:51:55,044 --> 00:51:57,544
- He's right. I overreacted.
- You mean...

516
00:51:57,624 --> 00:52:02,213
Not another word or I'll come down there
and push you over myself.

517
00:52:02,963 --> 00:52:05,513
I got it. I got it.

518
00:52:05,593 --> 00:52:07,593
I got it.

519
00:52:13,513 --> 00:52:15,773
Manny, Ellie, run! Run!

520
00:52:28,572 --> 00:52:32,122
I guess we finally
did something right together.

521
00:52:32,202 --> 00:52:37,252
Hey, don't mind me.
Just hanging off the edge of a cliff here.

522
00:52:57,311 --> 00:53:00,351
- Remember the good old days?
- Which good old days?

523
00:53:00,441 --> 00:53:03,941
You know. Yesterday, last week.

524
00:53:04,021 --> 00:53:09,491
Back when the trees went up and down
and the ground stayed under our feet.

525
00:53:09,571 --> 00:53:12,111
Yep. Those were the good days.

526
00:53:12,201 --> 00:53:16,661
Possums were possums
and mammoths were mammoths.

527
00:53:16,741 --> 00:53:19,201
- We should get some sleep.
- Yeah.

528
00:53:19,291 --> 00:53:24,290
Tomorrow's the day
the vulture said we're all going to die.

529
00:54:38,948 --> 00:54:41,368
Wait a minute.

530
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:43,958
Can I help you?

531
00:54:54,587 --> 00:54:57,587
Now, that's what I call respect.

532
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,177
Nice.

533
00:55:07,187 --> 00:55:10,357
Somebody here likes Sid.

534
00:55:10,897 --> 00:55:14,896
Who is your decorator?
I mean, this is fabulous.

535
00:55:19,946 --> 00:55:22,576
Fire King.

536
00:55:28,536 --> 00:55:34,416
Fire King? Well, you know, it's about time
someone recognized my true potential.

537
00:55:34,506 --> 00:55:36,666
Let there be fire.

538
00:56:46,363 --> 00:56:49,203
If only the guys could see me now.

539
00:56:50,823 --> 00:56:54,123
This is either really good
or really bad.

540
00:56:56,123 --> 00:56:57,293
No, no, no.

541
00:56:57,373 --> 00:56:59,878
Me Fire King. Why kill Fire King?

542
00:56:59,913 --> 00:57:03,332
A thousand years' bad juju
for killing Fire King.

543
00:57:03,422 --> 00:57:06,462
Super-heated rock from Earth's core
is surging to the crust,

544
00:57:06,552 --> 00:57:08,882
melting ice built up
over thousands of years.

545
00:57:08,972 --> 00:57:13,052
You're a very advanced race.
Together, we can look for a solution.

546
00:57:13,142 --> 00:57:15,762
We have one - sacrifice the Fire King.

547
00:57:15,852 --> 00:57:18,812
- Well, that's not very advanced.
- Worth a shot.

548
00:57:19,642 --> 00:57:21,642
No! No!

549
00:57:37,741 --> 00:57:40,081
Bad juju!

550
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,810
Water? Water!

551
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,300
Crash, I told you not to drink
before bed.

552
00:58:12,335 --> 00:58:15,160
I didn't do this.
At least, not all of it.

553
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:18,660
- What's happening?
- We overslept. We need to move.

554
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:21,040
What if we're the last creatures
left alive?

555
00:58:21,075 --> 00:58:23,330
We'll have to repopulate the Earth.

556
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:26,749
How? Everyone's either
a dude or our sister.

557
00:58:27,709 --> 00:58:30,549
Hi. Hey, Manny.

558
00:58:30,629 --> 00:58:33,589
Wow. What a night.
You'll never guess what happened.

559
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:36,139
You were sleepwalking.

560
00:58:36,219 --> 00:58:39,809
No, no, no. I was kidnapped
by a tribe of mini sloths.

561
00:58:39,889 --> 00:58:43,179
- That was gonna be my second guess.
- And they worshiped me.

562
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:47,479
I mean, sure, they tossed me into a
flaming tar pit, but they worshiped me.

563
00:58:47,559 --> 00:58:51,569
You were dreaming. Come on, the water's
rising faster than we're moving.

564
00:58:51,649 --> 00:58:56,818
I'm telling you, I was kidnapped.
I was worshiped. Guys.

565
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:58,908
Fine.

566
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:09,628
Can we slow down a little?
I'm dying here.

567
00:59:13,718 --> 00:59:16,178
It was just a figure of speech.

568
00:59:21,177 --> 00:59:25,017
They just sit there, watching us.

569
00:59:25,097 --> 00:59:27,937
I wish I knew what they were thinking.

570
01:01:01,154 --> 01:01:04,024
There. Now you know
what they were thinking.

571
01:01:09,574 --> 01:01:12,453
- Sid!
- What? It's catchy.

572
01:01:24,883 --> 01:01:28,553
- We made it.
- Yeah, we showed those scary vultures.

573
01:01:54,662 --> 01:01:58,952
It's just a little hot water and steam.
How bad could it be?

574
01:02:05,541 --> 01:02:09,421
I just did something
involuntary and messy.

575
01:02:10,471 --> 01:02:12,471
OK, come on.

576
01:02:13,511 --> 01:02:16,181
Manny. Get back.
It's a minefield out there.

577
01:02:16,261 --> 01:02:19,221
There's only one way to go.
Straight through.

578
01:02:19,311 --> 01:02:23,271
Straight through? We'd like to
keep the fur on our bodies, thank you.

579
01:02:23,351 --> 01:02:26,651
- We'll head back and go around.
- There's no time.

580
01:02:26,731 --> 01:02:29,401
The dam will burst before we make it.
We'll drown.

581
01:02:29,481 --> 01:02:31,951
If we go through this,
we get blown to bits.

582
01:02:32,031 --> 01:02:33,950
- We go forward.
- We go back.

583
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:36,530
- Forward.
- Back.

584
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:38,870
- Can I say something?
- No.

585
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:43,830
- You are so stubborn and hard-headed.
- Well, I guess that proves it.

586
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,920
I am a mammoth.

587
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:50,710
- Come on.
- Fine.

588
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:54,180
I don't know. Drowning sounds like
a much gentler way to go.

589
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:57,850
Blown to bits sounds so sudden.

590
01:03:08,479 --> 01:03:11,609
He's going to get himself killed.
Manny, wait.

591
01:03:11,689 --> 01:03:13,439
Manny.

592
01:03:36,378 --> 01:03:39,178
Kids, look, the last mammoth.

593
01:03:39,258 --> 01:03:41,598
I just heard you're going extinct.

594
01:03:41,678 --> 01:03:45,308
- You can't be two things.
- She thinks you're a jerk.

595
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:48,148
Where's your big, happy family?

596
01:03:48,228 --> 01:03:50,818
What's wrong with you?

597
01:03:50,898 --> 01:03:53,318
Manny, come on. We gotta go. Now!

598
01:04:00,577 --> 01:04:02,077
That way.

599
01:04:41,736 --> 01:04:47,746
Do not leave your children unattended.
All unattended children will be eaten.

600
01:04:51,915 --> 01:04:53,915
- Have you seen a mammoth?
- No, sorry.

601
01:04:53,995 --> 01:04:56,125
- Have you seen a mammoth?
- No.

602
01:04:56,205 --> 01:04:59,335
Possum? About 11 foot tall?

603
01:05:01,005 --> 01:05:04,385
- Hey, buddy, have you seen a mammoth?
- I sure have. Big as life.

604
01:05:04,465 --> 01:05:06,555
- Where?
- I'm looking at him.

605
01:05:06,635 --> 01:05:08,885
Not me.

606
01:05:08,975 --> 01:05:11,145
Poor guy doesn't know he's a mammoth.

607
01:06:10,703 --> 01:06:15,582
- I don't see her anywhere.
- Maybe she's already on board.

608
01:06:28,552 --> 01:06:30,552
Hurry, this way. Come on.

609
01:06:32,842 --> 01:06:36,512
- There it is.
- Ellie! Help!

610
01:06:45,151 --> 01:06:47,821
Come on, come on, run!

611
01:06:53,911 --> 01:06:55,911
Push.

612
01:06:58,621 --> 01:07:02,041
- You guys gotta go.
- We're not leaving you.

613
01:07:02,121 --> 01:07:04,581
- I'm not asking.
- Ellie, no.

614
01:07:07,131 --> 01:07:09,840
Ellie, don't worry.
We're going for help.

615
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,760
Stay here.

616
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:30,190
- Help us.
- Help! Somebody help.

617
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:32,360
Manny.

618
01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:34,740
Manny.

619
01:07:38,449 --> 01:07:41,619
- Manny.
- It's Ellie, she's trapped in a cave.

620
01:08:42,057 --> 01:08:43,717
Ellie.

621
01:08:43,807 --> 01:08:45,807
Manny.

622
01:08:48,897 --> 01:08:52,357
- Help!
- I'll save you.

623
01:08:56,777 --> 01:08:59,066
Great. Who's gonna save him?

624
01:09:01,696 --> 01:09:03,826
You really need to brush.

625
01:09:09,076 --> 01:09:12,706
OK, OK, OK. Jump in now.

626
01:09:14,046 --> 01:09:16,506
Come on, 'fraidy cat. Come on.

627
01:09:16,586 --> 01:09:20,506
You can do this, you can do this,
you can do this.

628
01:09:20,586 --> 01:09:22,966
Trust your instincts. Attack the water.

629
01:09:23,046 --> 01:09:25,176
I am not your prey. I am not your prey.

630
01:09:25,255 --> 01:09:27,675
I am not your prey.

631
01:09:50,745 --> 01:09:53,244
Attack the water. Stalking the prey.

632
01:09:53,324 --> 01:09:56,874
Claw, kick. Even babies can do it.
Come on.

633
01:09:56,954 --> 01:10:00,964
Claw, kick, claw, kick.

634
01:10:01,044 --> 01:10:04,174
Hey. I'm stalking the prey.

635
01:10:10,054 --> 01:10:12,054
Eddie.

636
01:10:25,733 --> 01:10:29,693
You did it, buddy.
You kicked water's butt.

637
01:10:29,783 --> 01:10:33,203
Nothing to it. Most animals
can swim as babies, you know.

638
01:10:33,283 --> 01:10:36,533
Yeah, but not tigers.
I left that part out.

639
01:10:51,802 --> 01:10:54,762
There he is.

640
01:10:54,842 --> 01:10:57,262
Ellie, hold on to me.

641
01:11:29,171 --> 01:11:31,591
Manny, Manny, behind you.

642
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:10,589
There they are.

643
01:12:11,669 --> 01:12:13,759
They made it.

644
01:12:24,269 --> 01:12:27,309
We thought we'd never see you again.

645
01:12:36,649 --> 01:12:38,818
We're gonna live.

646
01:12:42,448 --> 01:12:45,368
We're gonna die.

647
01:14:39,144 --> 01:14:40,859
Well, I'm not leaving.

648
01:14:40,894 --> 01:14:43,944
Grandpa, let go of the boat.
The flood's over.

649
01:14:44,024 --> 01:14:48,994
- This is my boat now.
- Come on, let's go. Come on, come on.

650
01:14:49,074 --> 01:14:53,164
Stu. We made it. We're gonna live.

651
01:14:53,244 --> 01:14:55,533
Well, I am anyway.

652
01:14:58,083 --> 01:15:01,003
I'm thinking about starting
a swim school.

653
01:15:01,083 --> 01:15:03,543
Sid's Squids.

654
01:15:08,463 --> 01:15:11,633
All hail Fire King.

655
01:15:16,853 --> 01:15:18,643
Hi.

656
01:15:22,692 --> 01:15:28,362
Fire King avert flood.
Join us, O great and noble flaming one.

657
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:35,822
No, not so fast there, OK.
You make a quality offer.

658
01:15:35,912 --> 01:15:41,502
But Fire King has a prior commitment.
His herd needs him.

659
01:15:42,002 --> 01:15:48,252
He is the gooey, sticky stuff
that holds us together.

660
01:15:49,382 --> 01:15:55,221
He made this herd,
and we'd be nothing without him.

661
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:58,931
- You mean it?
- Sid. Sid.

662
01:15:59,011 --> 01:16:01,931
That doesn't mean "want to touch".

663
01:16:07,561 --> 01:16:09,691
Don't ask.

664
01:17:10,039 --> 01:17:13,128
We're not the last ones anymore.

665
01:17:18,048 --> 01:17:20,048
You're not coming?

666
01:17:20,138 --> 01:17:22,388
You wanna go with them?

667
01:17:22,468 --> 01:17:24,638
I am a mammoth.

668
01:17:24,718 --> 01:17:27,348
I should probably be with a mammoth.

669
01:17:27,438 --> 01:17:29,938
Don't you think?

670
01:17:30,018 --> 01:17:32,018
Yeah, unless...

671
01:17:33,818 --> 01:17:35,818
Unless?

672
01:17:37,358 --> 01:17:39,698
Unless I...

673
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:44,987
I just wanna say...

674
01:17:45,907 --> 01:17:48,247
I need to tell you...

675
01:17:50,037 --> 01:17:53,957
I hope you find everything
you're looking for.

676
01:17:57,337 --> 01:17:59,337
You too.

677
01:18:33,666 --> 01:18:39,545
Manny, you've come a long way since we
met and I'll take full credit for that,

678
01:18:39,625 --> 01:18:44,635
but you need to let go of the past
so you can have a future.

679
01:18:48,675 --> 01:18:51,635
- Go after her.
- It's OK.

680
01:18:52,555 --> 01:18:54,805
We'll always be here for you.

681
01:18:55,515 --> 01:18:59,355
- I'll keep in touch.
- Yeah, yeah. You're a good friend.

682
01:18:59,435 --> 01:19:02,105
Point made. Now, go on. Scat.

683
01:19:08,324 --> 01:19:11,364
Our Manny's growing up.

684
01:19:11,954 --> 01:19:14,874
Ellie! Ellie!

685
01:19:19,164 --> 01:19:21,164
Manny.

686
01:19:22,674 --> 01:19:26,714
Ellie, I don't want us
to be together because we have to.

687
01:19:26,794 --> 01:19:29,424
I want us to be together
because we want to.

688
01:19:29,514 --> 01:19:31,673
And I wanna be with you, Ellie.

689
01:19:33,383 --> 01:19:38,143
- What do you say?
- Manny, I thought you were going...

690
01:19:42,143 --> 01:19:44,563
You're possum enough for me.

691
01:19:58,792 --> 01:20:04,672
Well, it's just you and me now.
Two bachelors knocking about in the wild.

692
01:20:05,082 --> 01:20:07,422
Fine. But I'm not gonna carry you.

693
01:20:07,502 --> 01:20:12,222
- I still have my pride, you know.
- Come on, buddy, for old time's sake.

694
01:20:12,302 --> 01:20:14,802
I'll carry him.

695
01:20:16,342 --> 01:20:19,262
- But your herd's leaving.
- We are now.

696
01:20:19,352 --> 01:20:20,812
Shotgun!

697
01:20:23,062 --> 01:20:25,771
Manny, who do you like better?
Me or Diego?

698
01:20:25,851 --> 01:20:29,151
- Diego. It's not even close.
- Told you.

699
01:20:29,231 --> 01:20:32,151
Manny, you can't choose
between your kids.

700
01:20:32,241 --> 01:20:35,281
He's not my kid. Not even my dog.

701
01:20:35,361 --> 01:20:37,956
If I had a dog and my dog had a kid...

702
01:20:37,991 --> 01:20:40,621
and the dog's kid had a pet,
that would be Sid.

703
01:20:40,701 --> 01:20:43,291
- Can I have a dog, Manny?
- No.

704
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:46,291
- Ellie, can I have a dog?
- Of course you can, sweetie.

705
01:20:46,371 --> 01:20:49,881
Ellie,
we have to be consistent with him.

706
01:23:09,136 --> 01:23:11,475
I saved you, little buddy.

707
01:23:23,865 --> 01:23:27,905
Calm down.
I saved you, little buddy. Remember?
