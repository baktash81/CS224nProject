351
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,132
Wow! The prettiest girl
in school,

352
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:32,900
and the coolest guy in school!

353
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,310
Oh, man, I got lucky.

354
00:16:34,435 --> 00:16:35,670
I mean, you guys are like
a power couple, dude!

355

No, no.
Yes!

356
00:16:37,238 --> 00:16:38,381

357
00:16:38,506 --> 00:16:40,175

358
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,484
Power.

359
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:42,852
Uh... Thanks!

360
00:16:42,977 --> 00:16:44,612
Yeah. You guys got kids?

361
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:45,988
No. No kids yet.

362
00:16:46,113 --> 00:16:47,915
We planned on it after college,

363
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,085
but Maggie went to law school,
I kept changing jobs.

364
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,664
You know, having kids just
isn't in our cards right now.

365
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:56,090
Not at this point, that's all.

366
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,267
Oh, okay.
Yeah.

367
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,093
Oh, I got an idea.
Let's do shots!

368
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,536
No!

369
00:17:00,661 --> 00:17:02,205
I'm sorry for saying
it like that, but no.

370

I haven't had shots
in almost 10 years, man.

371

What? Come on, we have to!
We're celebrating!

372

apologize to Big Rick here

440
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,123
and then go jerk each other
in the parking lot?

Yeah. You're right, CJ.

You need to go get that looked
at by a trained professional.

escalated this whole scenario

all these innocent people,

I can no longer, in good
conscience, walk away

451
00:19:28,776 --> 00:19:30,645
and jerk anyone off in the parking lot.

this whole thing goes down,

526
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,506
Man, I thought high school was
gonna be like Sixteen Candles

527
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:13,215
and I was gonna be like Molly Ringwald.

528
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,609
Sure, things were
difficult in the beginning,

529
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:16,151
but then, by the end,

530
00:22:16,276 --> 00:22:17,487
everything worked out.

531
00:22:17,612 --> 00:22:19,914
And Jake Ryan picked her up
in that red Porsche.

532
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,090
What-what?

533
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:23,292
You ever see that movie?

534
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:25,495
I'm black, so I don't know the...

535
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,187
Oh. You gotta
see it, dude.

536
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:30,466
Total classic. It's my
favorite all-time movie.

537
00:22:30,591 --> 00:22:31,792
Then I realized high school

538
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,737
was nothing like Sixteen Candles.

539
00:22:34,862 --> 00:22:36,931
And I'll never be like Molly Ringwald.

540
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:40,635
Yeah, well, depends on who you ask.

541
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,537
That's the thing.
For me, I...

542
00:22:43,804 --> 00:22:46,048
What's going on?

543
00:22:46,173 --> 00:22:49,018
Oh, wow.

544
00:22:49,143 --> 00:22:50,978
Hey, man, I just wanna say
that I'm really sorry

545
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,714
about what Trevor and those
guys did to you back then.

546
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,327
(ECHOING LAUGHTER)

547
00:22:58,452 --> 00:23:00,062
(EXCLAIMS)

548
00:23:00,187 --> 00:23:03,599
No biggie. I don't even
think about it anymore. No.

549
00:23:03,724 --> 00:23:05,100
Okay, good.

550
00:23:05,225 --> 00:23:07,061
Yeah. Here's the secret.
You know what I did, Jet?

551
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,496
I took all that stuff and
I balled it up real tight

552
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:12,475
and then I shoved it way down deep.

553
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,869
And I just pretty much ignore it.

554
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:18,047
You know, that sounds
really unhealthy, Bob.

555
00:23:18,172 --> 00:23:19,214
Hey, I gotta tell you.

556
00:23:19,339 --> 00:23:21,375
You were the only one
who helped me out that day.

557
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,943
In the gym?
Remember that?

558
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,521
And you gave me your lettermans jacket!

559
00:23:25,646 --> 00:23:26,881
Hey, not for nothing,

560
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:29,183
but I never got that jacket back, man.

561
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:31,118
Huh! Really?

562
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,062
Strange.

563
00:23:33,187 --> 00:23:34,488
Hey, but, listen,
I just wanna thank you

564
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:35,723
for what you did for me that day.

565
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:37,391
That was really cool of you, Jet.

566
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:40,703
Stop, man. It was the right
thing to do, you know?

567
00:23:40,828 --> 00:23:42,029
You wanna hear something weird?

568
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,105
What?

569
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,265
I have not been naked since that day.

570
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,101
I mean, not in front of anyone.

571
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:48,410
Never.

572
00:23:48,535 --> 00:23:50,137
So, you're telling me
that for the last 20 years,

573
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,939
you've never been seen
in your birthday suit?

574
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,373
What about when you have sex?

575
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:55,610
I keep it pitch-black,
just like Vin Diesel.

576
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:58,779
Hey, Bob, look, if you
ever wanna talk, I'm here.

577
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:00,890
So I don't mind, you know?

578
00:24:01,015 --> 00:24:02,316
I don't mind at all, if you wanna...

579
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,041
What?

580
00:24:07,087 --> 00:24:09,565
Whoa. This is all our stuff
from our year!

581
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:10,891
Yeah. Must be getting ready

582
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,568
for the reunion tomorrow night.

583
00:24:12,693 --> 00:24:13,994
Come on, man.
Let's get out of here.

584
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,096
What? No! "Get out..."
Look, you're all over this!

585
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:19,900
Look at this. Basketball,
baseball, cross country.

586
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:21,176
Hamlet.

587
00:24:21,301 --> 00:24:22,311
Prom King.

588
00:24:22,436 --> 00:24:23,913
There's Darla McGuckian.

589
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:26,248
Synchronized swimming, that's so sexy.

590
00:24:26,373 --> 00:24:27,817
This is like the Guinness Book

591
00:24:27,942 --> 00:24:30,144
of Golden Jet Records right there.
(TAPS GLASS)

592
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:32,321
I see that.

593
00:24:32,446 --> 00:24:35,558
To be honest with you, I don't
even recognize this guy anymore.

594
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:37,184
This guy, here, he was gonna...

595
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,353
He was gonna conquer the world.

596
00:24:40,788 --> 00:24:42,356
If 18-year-old me
could see me now,

597
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,591
he'd probably think
I was a total loser.

598
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,336
What? That's crazy talk!

599
00:24:47,461 --> 00:24:49,163
You're The Golden Jet, dude! Stop.

600
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:52,808
Stop, Bob. Spare me
with The Golden Jet shit.

601
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:55,269
I'm not The Golden Jet, man.
I'm an accountant.

602
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:56,994
That's my reality.

603
00:24:59,473 --> 00:25:03,018
(SIGHS) I just thought I was
meant for more, you know?

604
00:25:03,143 --> 00:25:05,379
My life would be something special.

605
00:25:07,081 --> 00:25:08,215
You know how they say every man

606
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,826
is the hero of his own story?

607
00:25:10,951 --> 00:25:12,662
Was that in Twilight?

608
00:25:12,787 --> 00:25:15,297
No, I don't think
that's where it's from.

609
00:25:15,422 --> 00:25:17,667
But those books are cool,
right? Vampires!

610
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:19,660
Oh, and there's a wolf-boy.
(GROWLS SOFTLY)

611
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:24,774
I'm not... I'm not talking
about Twilight, Bob, okay?

612
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:26,133
I'm talking about the fact
that I don't feel like

613
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,977
I'm the hero
of my own story. That's...

614
00:25:28,102 --> 00:25:29,870
How are you not the hero
of your own story?

615
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:31,280
No one else can be!

616
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:33,215
Yo, CJ, I gotta be
honest with you, man.

617
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,042
I mean, all this talk
about Calvin Joyner

618
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:36,543
not feeling like he's a hero...

619
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:38,578
That's crazy talk, man.

620
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,122
No. No, it's not.

621
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,449
You were the best thing
about high school.

622
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:43,984
I'll always believe in you.

623
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:46,862
Yo, do you remember those
backflips you used to do?

624
00:25:46,987 --> 00:25:48,756
The crowd would go crazy!
I was there, too.

625
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,891
I was, like,
"What? How's he do that?"

626
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,616
How did you do that?

627
00:25:53,894 --> 00:25:56,138
I don't know.
I just did it, man.

628
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,406
Exactly.

629
00:25:57,531 --> 00:25:59,308
So, do it now.

630
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:02,511
No, no. You're crazy! No.

631
00:26:02,636 --> 00:26:03,813
What's that?

632
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:05,139
What're you talking about?
What's what?

633
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:06,707
(SOFTLY) Golden Jet!
No, stop it.

634
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:08,642
Golden Jet!
Okay, stop it!

635
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,410
Golden Jet!
All right.

636
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:11,754
Golden Jet!

637
00:26:11,879 --> 00:26:15,049
I'm not gonna stop until
you do The Golden Jet flip!

638
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:16,258
Golden Jet!

639
00:26:16,383 --> 00:26:18,252
All right, everybody,
settle down. Settle down!

640
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:20,963
If the crowd wants a Golden Jet flip,

641
00:26:21,088 --> 00:26:23,123
then they gonna get a Golden Jet flip.

642
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,848
You go, girl!

643
00:26:26,927 --> 00:26:30,205
(GROANS) Oh, God!

644
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,099
That was so close, Jet.

645
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:33,275
(GROANS)

646
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,144
Here, buddy. Come on.

647
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:37,219
They must have just waxed these floors.

648
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,141
That was definitely a first, man.

649
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,384
(BOB LAUGHS)

650
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:44,319
Oh, man, I am beat.

651
00:26:44,444 --> 00:26:46,044
Oh.

652
00:26:47,514 --> 00:26:48,624
Hey, Jet!

653
00:26:48,749 --> 00:26:52,286
Man, I had a great time tonight.

654
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:53,729
Whoa.

655
00:26:53,854 --> 00:26:55,865
You know what? I had a
good time, too, man.

656
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,591
I feel like I needed this, you know?

657
00:26:57,716 --> 00:27:00,302
Yeah. Yeah. Me, too!

658
00:27:00,427 --> 00:27:01,470
Thank you.

659
00:27:01,595 --> 00:27:03,739
My pleasure, amigo.
Anytime.

660
00:27:03,864 --> 00:27:07,634
Hey, if there's ever anything I can
do for you, just say the word.

661
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,612
Wow. You really mean that?

662
00:27:10,737 --> 00:27:12,081
Yeah.

663
00:27:12,206 --> 00:27:14,750
I wasn't gonna bring it up,
but I might as well.

664
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:16,043
Lately, I've been having this problem

665
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:18,654
with my payroll account.
And, um...

666
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:20,522
It's all screwed up, somehow.

667
00:27:20,647 --> 00:27:23,617
You know, I was overseas working
for a while before I got fired.

668
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:24,727
So, it's kinda like

669
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:26,486
a forensic international account thingy

670
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:30,124
which, I think, is kind
of your specialty, right?

671
00:27:31,325 --> 00:27:32,601
Um...

672
00:27:32,726 --> 00:27:36,138
Yeah, no, it is. I'll take
a look at that for you.

673
00:27:36,263 --> 00:27:37,664
You would?
You would do that for me?

674
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:38,774
I've got the login info,

675
00:27:38,899 --> 00:27:40,434
if you wanna crack open your computer,

676
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,144
we can do this!

677
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:43,713
Oh, you mean now?

678
00:27:43,838 --> 00:27:46,006
That's awesome! Yeah!
Okay.

679
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:48,075
Look at this!
Hey, Bob...

680
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,084
Whoa!

681
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,544
Bob, you gotta keep your voice down!

682
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,022
(SOFTLY) Maggie's sleeping.

683
00:27:53,147 --> 00:27:54,223
Wow.

684
00:27:54,348 --> 00:27:55,950
This is a pretty serious international

685
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:57,760
account dossier you've got here.

686
00:27:57,885 --> 00:27:59,419
Right? I just want
to make sure

687
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:01,521
everything was hunky-dory.

688
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:03,246
(MUMBLING)

689
00:28:05,492 --> 00:28:07,194
Going to your router.

690
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,997
Now you're talking to me.

691
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,399
Bingo.

692
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,743
I'm in.

693
00:28:13,868 --> 00:28:16,303
Oh. That's great, Jet.
Thank you, man!

694
00:28:19,874 --> 00:28:21,884
I mean, just looking
at it first-hand,

695
00:28:22,009 --> 00:28:23,143
it kinda looks like it's a bunch

696
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,254
of off-shore
escrow accounts.

697
00:28:25,379 --> 00:28:28,858
These have been backwashed
into a series of domestic

698
00:28:28,983 --> 00:28:30,525
dummy accounts for some reason.

699
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:33,695
I mean, the logs are all crazy, too.
You have China,

700
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,098

and had drinks last night.

815

First of all, fuck Mark
Zuckerberg, all right?

821
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:19,448
Now, I accepted
because it was Facebook.

822
00:33:19,573 --> 00:33:20,915
And it's rude when you don't accept it

823
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,209
and I don't know if
the person on the other end

824
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,618
can see me not accept it.

825
00:33:23,743 --> 00:33:24,611
That's why I accepted.

Because I'm getting hot.

I'm not gonna take off my jacket

830
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,086
because that makes me look guilty.

831
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,789
And that's what
you guys look for. Hmm?

832
00:33:35,914 --> 00:33:38,425

00:35:29,436 --> 00:35:32,614
Well, hey. Well, yeah.

880
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:35,150
Yeah, wassup?

881
00:35:35,275 --> 00:35:37,919
What up, Bobby-o?

882
00:35:38,044 --> 00:35:40,222
Are you quite well?

883
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:41,556
I'm in big trouble.

884
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,817
Oh, God! I screwed up.
I screwed up big time.

885
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:46,195
We gotta talk.
Can you meet me?

886
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,396
Sure. Yeah. Where?

887
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:49,298
Where do you want me to meet you?

888
00:35:49,423 --> 00:35:51,090
I'm in the stairwell of your
building, two flights down.

889
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:53,168
Stairwell?
Hurry!

890
00:35:53,293 --> 00:35:55,962
He's in the stairwell, two flights down!
Move, move!

891
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:57,272
Alert Charlie team.

892
00:35:57,397 --> 00:35:59,040
Hold on. What's going on?
Am I safe here?

893
00:35:59,165 --> 00:36:01,234
As long as Bob Stone is in
the building, no one's safe.

894
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,370
Get back in your office now!

895
00:36:07,907 --> 00:36:08,850
Okay!

896
00:36:08,975 --> 00:36:11,378
Good news is we heard her, guys.

897
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:14,414
So, everybody,
let's all just stay calm.

898
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:17,050
As long as...
As long... Shit!

899
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:22,121

Relax.
Hey.

901
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:25,258
Great job at getting
them out of here, Jet.

902
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:26,601
Oh, Bob!
That's teamwork!

903
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,428
Wait! How did you...
What did you just do?

904
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:29,996
It's a tradecraft, buddy.

905
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:31,398

906
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:32,799

Oh, no shit!

908
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:35,810
Hey, hey! What're you
doing with my phone?

909
00:36:35,935 --> 00:36:37,437
You about to turn my phone
into a bomb, aren't you?

910
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:39,706
I've seen Homeland.
So I know what they do.

911
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:42,409
(LAUGHS) Homeland? No,
I'm ordering us an Uber.

912
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,886
Six minutes.
That's kinda tight.

913
00:36:45,011 --> 00:36:47,256
(SIGHS) I'm gonna need your tie.

914
00:36:47,381 --> 00:36:48,557
You're gonna... No!

915
00:36:48,682 --> 00:36:49,958
Your necktie, take it off. No,

916
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,618
I'm not taking my tie off!
Come on, Jet!

917
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:53,295
Don't do that. Don't do that. (LAUGHS)

918
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,588
That's good.
Save it, save it, save it.

919
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:55,989
Save it, Jet.
Fine, take it, take it.

920
00:36:56,114 --> 00:36:57,824
There we go, just right over here.

921
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,626
You can have it.
Okay, that...

922
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:01,127
Listen to me. Listen.

923
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:02,371
Stop. Stop!

924
00:37:02,496 --> 00:37:04,431
I need to know what is
happening, right now.

925
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,566
Okay, okay. You know what?
Moving too fast.

926
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:10,479
Bottom line, are you in or you out?

927
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:12,038
What are you...
In or out of what?

928
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:14,541
Mmm-mmm. No time for
questions, just action.

929
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:17,051
In or out? Okay, well, then I'm out.

930
00:37:17,176 --> 00:37:19,446
I'm sorry, Jet.
Actually you're already in.

931
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:20,889
Then why would you ask me?

932
00:37:21,014 --> 00:37:22,857
Because I thought
you would go, "I'm in, Bob!"

933
00:37:22,982 --> 00:37:24,451
And we would've
had a really cool moment,

934
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,119
but you kinda ruined the whole thing.

935
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,195
I ruined...

936
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,397
Okay, okay, okay.

937
00:37:28,522 --> 00:37:29,864
Listen to me right now.

938
00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:31,725
Bob, I don't know what it is
that you're into

939
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,393
but what I do know is that

940
00:37:33,518 --> 00:37:34,961
I am really, really

941
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,372
100% out!

942
00:37:37,497 --> 00:37:38,565
Do you understand that?

943
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:39,933

Okay. Stop it,
stop it, stop it.

949
00:37:47,707 --> 00:37:49,250
This is not a game.

950
00:37:49,375 --> 00:37:51,386
I'm being serious right now.

951
00:37:51,511 --> 00:37:53,111
I'm out!

952
00:37:55,348 --> 00:37:56,525
Okay. Okay.

953
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:59,294
I can't say I'm not disappointed, Jet,

954
00:37:59,419 --> 00:38:00,920
but if you're out, you're out.

955
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,697
Thank you! I'm out!

956
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,058
Well, I'm just happy
that we can communicate

957
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:06,635
openly and honestly.

958
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,338
I think it says a lot
about our relationship.

Wait, hold up, wait. What're you doing?
Oh, my God!

Here's the thing, though.

961

There's only one way
for you to get out.

00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:16,478
What's that?

963
00:38:16,603 --> 00:38:18,037
You gotta get in first.

00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:19,381

965
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:20,807

968

I will do no such thing.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1058
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,591
Oh, shit!

1059
00:42:22,716 --> 00:42:24,316
Whoo-hoo!

1062
00:42:39,332 --> 00:42:40,809
Whoo!

1063
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:42,802
Wow! Did you
feel that, Jet?

1064
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:45,604
That was the balls right there!

1065
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,329
(SCREAMING)

1066
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:52,320
CALVIN: Get it off!

1067
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:53,546
You guys order an Uber?

(GUN FIRING)

1069
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,892
What are you doing?

1070
00:42:58,017 --> 00:42:59,552
You better get your tuchus in the car.

1071
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:00,686
You're gonna get shot!

1072
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:01,988
Don't shoot me! Shoot him!

1073
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:04,432
Shoot him! I'm out!
I'm out! I'm out!

1074
00:43:04,557 --> 00:43:07,060
Let me in! Let me in!
Let me in! Go, Bob!

1075
00:43:11,865 --> 00:43:14,008
Put the word out to all assets.

1076
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,969
I'm doubling the price on Bob's head.

1077
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,212
Hey, what the shit,
honey... (GROANS)

1078
00:43:18,337 --> 00:43:19,313
(THUDS)

1079
00:43:19,438 --> 00:43:21,040
Get Larry on it.

1080
00:43:26,245 --> 00:43:27,588
Car, car, car!

1081
00:43:27,713 --> 00:43:29,323
All right, well,
here's the dilly-o, Jet.

1082
00:43:29,448 --> 00:43:31,217
About three weeks ago,
an enemy of the state

1083
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:33,227
codenamed "The Black Badger"

1084
00:43:33,352 --> 00:43:35,822
stole the encryption keys to the
entire US spy satellite program

1085
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,331
which he's gonna sell to a buyer

1086
00:43:37,456 --> 00:43:39,192
from that auction site
on your computer last night.

1087
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:40,201
Bob...

1088
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,903
If we lose control of our satellites,

1089
00:43:42,028 --> 00:43:44,238
we're completely vulnerable
to any terrorist attacks.

1090
00:43:44,363 --> 00:43:46,365
That's why I had to go back to
your office and get you, Jet.

1091
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,242
I need your super sweet
accounting skills

1092
00:43:48,367 --> 00:43:50,369
to help me figure out the
last piece of this puzzle

1093
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:52,906
which is the transaction
number from the winning bid.

1094
00:43:53,031 --> 00:43:55,172
That'll tell us where
the deal is going down.

1095
00:43:56,776 --> 00:43:59,187
That way, we can get The Black Badger.

1096
00:43:59,312 --> 00:44:00,646
I can't do it without you, Jet.

1097
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:01,956
Stop the car.

1098
00:44:02,081 --> 00:44:03,917
You stop the car right now!
Stop the car!

1099
00:44:04,042 --> 00:44:05,952
Okay, okay.
That's a great idea, Jet.

1100
00:44:06,077 --> 00:44:07,987
We should get off the grid right now.

1101
00:44:09,022 --> 00:44:10,622
CALVIN: Whoa!

1102
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,997
All right. We're clear.

1103
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:25,079
Okay.

1104
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,606
Okay. Let's just take
some deep breaths.

1105
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:29,918
Okay? Deep breaths.

1106
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:32,486
All you gotta do is get out of this car

1107
00:44:32,611 --> 00:44:34,914
and have a rational
conversation with Bob

1108
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:36,639
and he'll understand.

1109
00:44:45,091 --> 00:44:48,027
Robert, I would like to
go home now, please.

1110
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:49,670
Buddy, you and me both.

1111
00:44:49,795 --> 00:44:52,173
But until we clear our names,
there's no going home.

1112
00:44:52,298 --> 00:44:54,675
I'm sorry, can you clarify
that last sentence for me?

1113
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,102
Yeah, well, now that you're in...

1114
00:44:56,227 --> 00:44:58,504
Let me stop you
right there. I'm not in.

1115
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:00,114
I never said that I was in.

1116
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,084
In fact, I expressly remember
saying that I was out!

1117
00:45:03,209 --> 00:45:04,844
I know, but they think you're in.

1118
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:06,220
I am...

1119
00:45:06,345 --> 00:45:08,289
I'm freaking out!
I'm out!

1120
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:10,124
What's left to tell?
Hey, no, I get it.

1121
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,784
I'm not in! I'm just saying
they think you're in.

1122
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:14,653
I'm not in! I am not in!
I get it.

1123
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:16,564
I'm not in! I'm out!

1124
00:45:16,689 --> 00:45:19,758
One sec, Jet, just
gotta disable the GPS.

1125
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,069
Where did you...

1126
00:45:21,194 --> 00:45:22,862
You wanna go under...
That's fine!

1127
00:45:22,987 --> 00:45:24,072
Wait a minute.

1128
00:45:24,197 --> 00:45:26,299
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

1129
00:45:26,424 --> 00:45:28,868
This whole thing was done on purpose.

1130
00:45:28,993 --> 00:45:30,636
This is your plan!

1131
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:32,280
You tricked me!

1132
00:45:32,405 --> 00:45:34,849
It's fine, but I know you tricked me.

1133
00:45:34,974 --> 00:45:36,575
Trick you? You tricked... Hey, boy!

1134
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,643
What?
(LAUGHS)

1135
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:38,987
What'd you just...

1136
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:40,413
I didn't trick you,
you offered to help me.

1137
00:45:40,538 --> 00:45:42,048
You know what's funny?
Harris told me.

1138
00:45:42,173 --> 00:45:43,457
She told me everything, man.

1139
00:45:43,582 --> 00:45:45,093
She told me that you stole the codes.

1140
00:45:45,218 --> 00:45:46,319
Let me tell you something about Harris.

1141
00:45:46,444 --> 00:45:48,262
You can't trust her, all right?

1142
00:45:48,387 --> 00:45:49,956
She's already trying to frame
me for my partner's murder!

1143
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:51,800
You killed your partner?
No.

1144
00:45:51,925 --> 00:45:52,934
I would never do that.

1145
00:45:53,059 --> 00:45:54,235
The Black Badger killed my partner.

1146
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,628
Let me explain to you something, dude.

1147
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,671
This is what happened.

1148
00:45:57,796 --> 00:46:00,266
After The Black Badger stole the
satellite encryption codes,

1149
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:04,070
my partner Phil and I tracked
him to a penthouse in Kiev.

1150
00:46:04,195 --> 00:46:05,814
Hey, Phil.
Yeah.

1151
00:46:05,939 --> 00:46:08,216
I'll see you on the other side.

1152
00:46:08,341 --> 00:46:10,143
See you on the other side.

1153
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:12,821
All right.

1154
00:46:12,946 --> 00:46:14,388
God, I love that guy.

1155
00:46:14,513 --> 00:46:16,049
BOB: He knew we were coming,
so he set a trap.

1156
00:46:16,174 --> 00:46:18,384
Hey, Bob! Bob!

1157
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:19,527
No!

1158
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:22,763
BOB: Phil was my partner,
my teammate

1159
00:46:22,888 --> 00:46:23,957
and I couldn't save him.

1160
00:46:24,082 --> 00:46:25,682
No!
(EXPLOSION)

1161
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,003
It was awful, Cal.

1162
00:46:29,128 --> 00:46:30,978
It was a setup,
right from the get-go.

1163
00:46:32,365 --> 00:46:33,707
Damn, man.

1164
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:35,301
The Black Badger was never there.

1165
00:46:35,426 --> 00:46:37,836
I should've been the one
on that elevator, not Phil.

1166
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:38,980
God.

1167
00:46:39,105 --> 00:46:41,415
Okay. Bob, please...

1168
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:44,010
I'm begging you, man. Can
you just let me go home?

1169
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:45,486
CJ, I totally understand.

1170
00:46:45,611 --> 00:46:47,513
But right now, Agent
Harris and her taskforce

1171
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,357
has that place surveilled
up the yin-yang.

1172
00:46:49,482 --> 00:46:51,217
She's got contract killers
looking for us.

1173
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:52,751
Your place isn't safe.

1174
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:54,428
Oh, my God. Maggie.

1175
00:46:54,553 --> 00:46:57,253
Maggie! What the hell am I
supposed to do about Maggie?

1176
00:46:59,225 --> 00:47:00,825
(SHOUTS) Get down, Jet!

00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:29,545
Oh, shit.

1183
00:47:34,493 --> 00:47:36,093
Larry.

1184
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:39,865
Thought you retired.

1185
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:41,442
I did.

1186
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,545
But you're worth a lot of
money, Bob, dead or alive.

1187
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:46,305
Well, tough luck,
because I've got back up.

1188
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,030
Ain't that right, Jet?

1189
00:47:50,543 --> 00:47:52,186
Jet!

(GROANS)

1191
00:48:07,993 --> 00:48:09,593

(PHONE RINGING)

1193
00:48:13,666 --> 00:48:16,177
Hey, baby. I know.
I'm sorry I'm late.

1194
00:48:16,302 --> 00:48:18,346
The stupid Koplin deposition ran long.

1195
00:48:18,471 --> 00:48:20,539
I'm leaving right now.
I'll meet you at the house.

1196
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:21,983
No, no, no!
Don't go home!

1197
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:23,676
Don't go home!
Why? What's going on?

1198
00:48:23,801 --> 00:48:26,554
Nothing! Nothing.
I'm just running late, too.

1199
00:48:26,679 --> 00:48:30,258
So I was gonna say let's just
meet at Dr. Dan's office.

1200
00:48:30,383 --> 00:48:32,651
Yeah. Okay.
Is everything all right?

1201
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:34,963
Yeah! Yeah. Why?

1202
00:48:35,088 --> 00:48:36,998
Everything's fine.

1203
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:38,857
Uh, because you kind of sound like
Ray Liotta at the end of Goodfellas.

1204
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:41,202
(LAUGHS) What?

1205
00:48:41,327 --> 00:48:43,496
That's so funny, babe.
That's such a good reference.

1206
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:45,464
That's classic Mags right there.

1207
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,376
So, okay. So you're not
gonna go home, right?

1208
00:48:48,501 --> 00:48:49,810
Okay, fine.
I won't go home.

1209
00:48:49,935 --> 00:48:51,604
I'll meet you at Dr. Dan's.
See you soon.

All right, bye.

1212
00:49:16,862 --> 00:49:18,462
Get in.

1213
00:49:35,348 --> 00:49:38,050
(STAMMERING) I'm gonna
address the elephant

1214
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:39,185
in the room.

1215
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:42,530
Okay, first of all, you...

1216
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:45,533
You guys, I want to say sorry to.

1217
00:49:45,658 --> 00:49:49,528
Because what you're probably
thinking is not what happened.

1218
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:50,871
Accidents!

1219
00:49:50,996 --> 00:49:52,306

1222
00:49:54,892 --> 00:49:56,202
Well, it can happen.

1223
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:59,513
Okay? Today is proof
that it can happen. So...

1224
00:49:59,638 --> 00:50:01,982
I'm glad I got to
get that off my chest.

1225
00:50:02,107 --> 00:50:03,942
Relax, Mr. Joyner.
I believe you.

1226
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:05,719
Okay, thank you.

1227
00:50:05,844 --> 00:50:08,614
Trust me, I know a scared-shitless
civilian when I see one.

1228
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,115
You don't have to convince me.

1229
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,993
You got him over here.
That is me.

1230
00:50:13,118 --> 00:50:15,053
Right now, I'm not comfortable.

1231
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,755
Okay, I am scared, okay?

1232
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,333
I don't have no shit in my system.

1233
00:50:19,458 --> 00:50:21,694
If I sat down on a toilet,
nothing's coming out.

1234
00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:22,928
Farts or just air.

1235
00:50:23,053 --> 00:50:24,230
(SLOW WHISTLES)

1236
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:26,365
(HISSING)

1237
00:50:29,402 --> 00:50:30,669
It'd sound like lasers.

1238
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:32,613
Thank you for that description.

1239
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,607
Mr. Joyner,
let me explain something.

1240
00:50:34,732 --> 00:50:36,175
Bob's last forced psych eval

1241
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,187
show a person rapidly
losing his grip on reality.

1242
00:50:39,312 --> 00:50:41,189
Bob became obsessed with a ghost,

1243
00:50:41,314 --> 00:50:42,581
a figment of his imagination,

1244
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,383
he started calling,
"The Black Badger."

1245
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:46,485
This obsession led to an instability,

1246
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:49,355
first reported by his partner,
Phil, three weeks ago.

1247
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,066
Just before Phil
was killed in the field.

1248
00:50:52,191 --> 00:50:53,634
Do you know how Phil died?

1249
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:56,529
Yeah, uh, Bob told me that
The Black Badger killed him.

1250
00:51:00,666 --> 00:51:02,510
What?

1251
00:51:02,635 --> 00:51:03,677
What?

1252
00:51:03,802 --> 00:51:07,748
Mr. Joyner, Bob Stone
is The Black Badger.

1253
00:51:07,873 --> 00:51:10,684
Phil was Bob's partner of six years.

1254
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:11,785
His best friend.

1255
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:12,878
See you on the other side.

1256
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:15,055
See you on the other side.

1257
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:16,657
Hey, Bob!

1258
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:19,184
AGENT HARRIS: After he stole
the satellite encryption codes

1259
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:20,653
Bob betrayed Phil.

1260
00:51:20,778 --> 00:51:22,230
No!

1261
00:51:22,355 --> 00:51:25,258
He killed him to cover his tracks.

1262
00:51:28,894 --> 00:51:32,206
And, after that, Bob went rogue.

1263
00:51:32,331 --> 00:51:34,300
This is all that's left of Phil.

1264
00:51:37,836 --> 00:51:41,014
Um, this is PornHub.

1265
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:44,818
Oh, shit, shit,
shit. Sorry.

1266
00:51:44,943 --> 00:51:46,279
There you go.

1267
00:51:46,404 --> 00:51:48,356
CALVIN: Oh! Oh, God!

1268
00:51:48,481 --> 00:51:50,082
Oh, I didn't see that coming.

1269
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:51,807
(BREATHES HEAVILY)
Oh, man!

1270
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:54,219
It's a hell of a way to go.

1271
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:56,096
Okay, wait a minute.

1272
00:51:56,221 --> 00:51:57,923
Why wouldn't Bob just go sell the
satellite encryption codes himself?

1273
00:51:58,048 --> 00:51:59,725
Because in a black market,
blind-bidding situation

1274
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,594
the buyer and the seller,
they don't know each other.

1275
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:02,970
They need the auction site

1276
00:52:03,095 --> 00:52:04,196
to tell them exactly where to meet up

1277
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:06,039
and when to make the exchange.

1278
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:09,167
The transaction number from the
auction site gives them that,

1279
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:12,213
which means Bob still needs you.

1280
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:13,606
Which is why we find ourselves

1281
00:52:13,731 --> 00:52:15,741
in a little catch-and-release
scenario.

1282
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:18,552
You are the only one Bob trusts.

1283
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,245
That's why we're
putting you in the field.

1284
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:23,123
The next time you're with Bob,

1285
00:52:23,248 --> 00:52:24,992
press this button.

1286
00:52:25,117 --> 00:52:26,717
We're going to have him cold.

1287
00:52:32,625 --> 00:52:34,527
Now, go take care of your marriage.

1288
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:37,730
Oh, one more thing.
Don't tell your wife shit.

1289
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,464
All right.

1290
00:52:41,834 --> 00:52:43,235
MAGGIE: I just don't know
what's wrong.

1291
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,803
I mean, the man that I married,

1292
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:46,972
the person I knew in high school,

1293
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:51,352
he was filled with
drive and desire. I mean...

1294
00:52:51,477 --> 00:52:52,778
We used to sneak off every lunch hour

1295
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:54,480
and make out under the gym bleachers.

1296
00:52:54,605 --> 00:52:56,524
Like, that guy, back then,

1297
00:52:56,649 --> 00:52:57,950
he wanted things, you know?

1298
00:52:58,075 --> 00:52:59,560
DR. DAN: Hmm.

1299
00:52:59,685 --> 00:53:01,219
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late. I
couldn't find the parking.

1300
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:03,389
Hi, no, no, it's okay.
We got started without you.

1301
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:05,766
Babe, Calvin,
this is Dr. Dan.

1302
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:06,934
Hello, Calvin.

1303
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:09,002
Oh, shit! Oh, jeez. What's the matter?

1304
00:53:09,127 --> 00:53:11,597
Holy shit! Get behind me!
Honey... Calvin, what?

1305
00:53:11,722 --> 00:53:13,907
It's okay, Maggie.
It's okay. Just relax.

1306
00:53:14,032 --> 00:53:16,535
This is a very common reaction
in the therapeutic process.

1307
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:17,611
It is?
What?

1308
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,146
It is.
It absolutely is.

1309
00:53:19,271 --> 00:53:21,949
Calvin, this is a very safe place.
Please, sit down.

1310
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:23,976
This is not a safe place! No, no, no.
Honey, it's a...

1311
00:53:24,101 --> 00:53:25,711
No, this is most definitely
not a safe place!

1312
00:53:25,836 --> 00:53:27,680
Me and my wife
are leaving. Let's go.

1313
00:53:27,805 --> 00:53:29,782
No, no, no! You are
going to sit down...

1314
00:53:29,907 --> 00:53:32,885
And we are going to go through
this therapeutic process...

1315
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:35,396
Yes...together, as a couple.

1316
00:53:35,521 --> 00:53:37,398
Um... Fine, fine, fine.

1317
00:53:37,523 --> 00:53:39,157
Sit down. Thank you.

1318
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:40,401
Fine.

1319
00:53:40,526 --> 00:53:41,960
Okay, guys.
Why don't we start off

1320
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:44,262
with a little bit of word association?

1321
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:45,373
Okay.

1322
00:53:45,498 --> 00:53:46,840
This is exciting.

1323
00:53:46,965 --> 00:53:49,402
I've heard this can really
open a couple up.

1324
00:53:49,527 --> 00:53:52,713
Uh, Maggie, I'm going to
offer you a word,

1325
00:53:52,838 --> 00:53:55,908
and you respond however you're moved to

1326
00:53:56,033 --> 00:53:57,009
from here.

1327
00:53:57,134 --> 00:53:58,085
Okay.

1328
00:53:58,210 --> 00:53:59,512
Black.
White.

1329
00:53:59,637 --> 00:54:01,154
Water.
Ocean.

1330
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,381
Sunshine.

1331
00:54:02,506 --> 00:54:03,857
Happy.

1332
00:54:03,982 --> 00:54:06,794
I'm very impressed, Maggie.
Really?

1333
00:54:06,919 --> 00:54:08,521
You're very in tune.

1334
00:54:08,646 --> 00:54:10,155
I'm very in tune.

1335
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,300
Calvin, you're next.

1336
00:54:12,425 --> 00:54:14,302
I do not want to do this.

1337
00:54:14,427 --> 00:54:17,095
Relax, Calvin.
There are no wrong answers.

1338
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:18,820
Up.

1339
00:54:19,898 --> 00:54:21,275
Down.

1340
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,010
Mmm.

1341
00:54:23,135 --> 00:54:24,545
"Mmm." What is that?

1342
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:26,046
What're you writing in your book?

1343
00:54:26,171 --> 00:54:27,748
It's fine. Don't freak out.
Nobody's freaking out.

1344
00:54:27,873 --> 00:54:29,241
I just don't understand
the rules to the game.

1345
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:30,551
Freaking out.

1346
00:54:30,676 --> 00:54:32,244
Let's switch gears for a second, okay?

1347
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:36,014
Why don't we try a simple
role-playing exercise?

1348
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:38,016
Calvin, you be Calvin

1349
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:40,486
and I will become Maggie.

1350
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:42,763
(GASPS) Mmm.

1351
00:54:42,888 --> 00:54:44,488
I'm confused.

1352
00:54:48,694 --> 00:54:50,563
It's called "soul gazing."

1353
00:54:50,688 --> 00:54:54,775
Stare into my soul
and I'll stare into yours.

1354
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,810
Maggie, this...
Hey. Shh.

1355
00:54:56,935 --> 00:54:59,271
There's no talking,
and don't look away.

1356
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:01,173
(WHISPERS)
Stare into my soul.

1357
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,316
You are not my...

1358
00:55:02,441 --> 00:55:03,809
Shh. There's no talking.

1359
00:55:03,934 --> 00:55:05,753
Babe, I'm not staring...

1360
00:55:05,878 --> 00:55:08,889
(WHISPERS) Me and you.
Stay with me. I'm your wife.

1361
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:10,883
You are not my wife.
(BOTH EXCLAIMING)

1362
00:55:11,008 --> 00:55:13,226
(GASPS)

1363
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:15,195
How could you hit your wife?

1364
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,589
How can I...
How can I what?

1365
00:55:16,714 --> 00:55:18,332
You hit your wife!
No...

1366
00:55:18,457 --> 00:55:19,492
He hit me!
Okay.

1367
00:55:19,617 --> 00:55:20,859
He hit you!
Okay.

1368
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,584
You hit us!

1369
00:55:26,632 --> 00:55:28,467
I'm swaddling you.
I know what you're doing.

1370
00:55:28,592 --> 00:55:30,202
I'm swaddling you.
I know what you're...

1371
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:31,537
Come here.

1372
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:33,238
Oh, my God!

1373
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:35,082
You...

1374
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:38,276
You know what?
We're leaving! Let's go!

1375
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:40,053
This is not real.

1376
00:55:40,178 --> 00:55:41,622
It's real to me.

1377
00:55:41,747 --> 00:55:42,956
You know what, Calvin?

1378
00:55:43,081 --> 00:55:45,417
If you can't commit
to working on our marriage,

1379
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:47,252
then you need to let me know.

1380
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:49,287
Maggie, you...
(DOOR OPENS)

1381
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:50,698
(CHUCKLING)

1382
00:55:50,823 --> 00:55:52,533
What!
Oh, my God!

1383
00:55:52,658 --> 00:55:53,992
You're...
Something's not right.

1384
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:56,904
Come on, Jet, listen.
Come on, come on, Jet!

1385
00:55:57,029 --> 00:55:59,131
Now, I know things got a
little rough there at the end.

1386
00:55:59,256 --> 00:56:00,566
But the truth is, with all the heat

1387
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:01,934
that you have coming down on you,

1388
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:04,344
Maggie is definitely safer without you.

1389
00:56:04,469 --> 00:56:06,880
And, trust me, when this
whole thing is said and done

1390
00:56:07,005 --> 00:56:08,649
and you basically save
the entire free world,

1391
00:56:08,774 --> 00:56:09,808
she's going to forgive you.

1392
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:11,376
It'll all work itself out.

1393
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:13,286
It'll all work itself out?

1394
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:15,614
Okay, Bob, you know, I'm sick
of playing games with you.

1395
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:17,625
Where's the real Dr. Dan?

1396
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:19,226
(MUMBLING)
What-what?

1397
00:56:19,351 --> 00:56:21,962
Oh, my... Dr. Dan, I had
nothing to do with this.

1398
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:23,556
He's fine. I'll get you
some water in a little bit.

1399
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:24,657
(MUMBLING)
Thanks, doc.

1400
00:56:24,782 --> 00:56:26,191
(DOOR CLOSES)
You know...

1401
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:28,260
That's it. That is it.

1402
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,062
That is it.

1403
00:56:31,463 --> 00:56:32,840
All right, Jet.

1404
00:56:32,965 --> 00:56:35,175
I see that Harris has
given you a button to push.

1405
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:38,036
Relax, I would've taken the same
deal, too, if I was in your shoes.

1406
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:40,639
Otherwise, she wouldn't let
you out of her sight, right?

1407
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:43,083
It makes perfect sense.

1408
00:56:43,208 --> 00:56:46,119
But you're not going to
press the button, right?

1409
00:56:46,244 --> 00:56:49,047
You got the top-secret
satellite codes?

1410
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:50,323
Yes or no?

1411
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:52,350
This ain't the time to bullshit me.

1412
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:53,994
Okay, my ass is sweating.

1413
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,588
I'm nervous.
Don't bullshit me!

1414
00:56:55,713 --> 00:56:57,731
Of course not, dude.
Hey, hey, come on!

1415
00:56:57,856 --> 00:56:59,166
Of course, I don't have the codes.

1416
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:00,893
Why would I go through
all this trouble, then?

1417
00:57:01,018 --> 00:57:02,703
I need your skill set, Jet,

1418
00:57:02,828 --> 00:57:05,631
to help me get the bank transaction
numbers to the winning bid.

1419
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:07,441
We already know it's going down tonight

1420
00:57:07,566 --> 00:57:08,934
from the countdown on your computer.

1421
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:10,811
Now, all we need is
the "where."

1422
00:57:10,936 --> 00:57:12,170
And the bank transaction numbers

1423
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:13,338
will give us the "where."

1424
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:14,582
That's why I need you.

1425
00:57:14,707 --> 00:57:16,041
Your job gives you access to

1426
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:17,918
exactly that kind of information.

1427
00:57:18,043 --> 00:57:20,378
Then we can get The Badger,
we can get the buyer

1428
00:57:20,503 --> 00:57:21,580
in one fell swoop.

1429
00:57:21,705 --> 00:57:23,515
And it'll all be over tonight.

1430
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,817
Please, I swear.

1431
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:26,652
You gotta believe me.

1432
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:38,405
Can't you just get us
the transaction number?

1433
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:40,774
Not when the money originates
from an offshore account.

1434
00:57:40,899 --> 00:57:43,535
When that happens, then only a certified
international banking official

1435
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:44,678
can access it.

1436
00:57:44,803 --> 00:57:46,680
But, it shouldn't be a problem.

1437
00:57:46,805 --> 00:57:48,774
We just give this guy the offshore
account numbers that you gave me,

1438
00:57:48,899 --> 00:57:50,375
then he can give us
the transaction number

1439
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,745
without knowing that he's
committing treason when he does it.

1440
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:54,246
Sound familiar?

1441
00:57:54,371 --> 00:57:56,156
Ouch! Low blow, CJ.

1442
00:57:56,281 --> 00:57:58,483
Hey, besides, it's only
treason if we're wrong.

1443
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:00,208
Who's this mystery man?

1444
00:58:01,319 --> 00:58:03,030
It's Trevor.

1445
00:58:03,155 --> 00:58:05,023
(LAUGHING)

1446
00:58:07,092 --> 00:58:08,692
Trevor.

1447
00:58:10,829 --> 00:58:12,631
TREVOR: This week
just keeps getting better.

1448
00:58:12,756 --> 00:58:14,474
You know, I mean...

1449
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:17,670
Robbie Wheirdicht and Calvin "The
Golden Jet" Joyner in my office.

1450
00:58:17,795 --> 00:58:19,772
Who would've thunk it?
Not me.

1451
00:58:19,897 --> 00:58:21,715
This is great, huh?

1452
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,909
Talk about caterpillar
to the butterfly...

1453
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:25,978
What is this? P-90-X?

1454
00:58:26,103 --> 00:58:29,214
More like
"P-1,000,000-X," huh?

1455
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,958
Congratulations.

1456
00:58:31,083 --> 00:58:32,660
CALVIN: (STAMMERS)
Hey, I, um...

1457
00:58:32,785 --> 00:58:34,261
I really appreciate the help, Trevor.

1458
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:36,722
My client's all on me to get
this stuff handled right away.

1459
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:38,231
So, you know, if we could...

1460
00:58:38,356 --> 00:58:40,033
Say no more. It's my pleasure.
I've been there.

1461
00:58:40,158 --> 00:58:41,794
These international accounts
can be very, very tricky

1462
00:58:41,919 --> 00:58:43,195
if you don't have the right clearances.

1463
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,297
You can get a bunch of
digital red tape.

1464
00:58:45,422 --> 00:58:47,399
I'm happy to help, you know?

1465
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,576
Robbie.

1466
00:58:48,701 --> 00:58:50,277
You're such a blast
from the past, buddy.

1467
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:51,770
How long has it been since I saw you?

1468
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:53,947
Was it high school?

1469
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,708
(WHIMPERING)

1470
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:57,484
What's that?

1471
00:58:57,609 --> 00:58:59,519
(STUTTERS) Um... How we doing
with those account access codes?

1472
00:58:59,644 --> 00:59:00,713
Are they coming?
TREVOR: It's coming.

1473
00:59:00,838 --> 00:59:02,823
Everything's good?
It's coming.

1474
00:59:02,948 --> 00:59:04,683
I'm going as fast as I can. I know you
guys are in a rush. I'm so sorry.

1475
00:59:04,808 --> 00:59:06,760
Anything for a couple of
fellow Centaurs.

1476
00:59:06,885 --> 00:59:08,120
Speaking of which, you guys are going

1477
00:59:08,245 --> 00:59:09,888
to the reunion tonight, right?

1478
00:59:11,556 --> 00:59:13,300
No, I don't think so.

1479
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:14,768
You're both going.
(COMPUTER CHIMES)

1480
00:59:14,893 --> 00:59:16,528
Here it is. Here's your
transaction number.

1481
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:18,405
You're both going because
you want to know what?

1482
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:20,465
They're going to vote on
homecoming king and queen again.

1483
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:22,334
Maybe you and Maggie
can make it two for two.

1484
00:59:22,459 --> 00:59:24,837
Now, before you go,
stay seated one second.

1485
00:59:24,962 --> 00:59:27,280
Give me two minutes, sit down.

1486
00:59:27,405 --> 00:59:29,382
(SIGHS) Men,

1487
00:59:29,507 --> 00:59:30,976
a few years ago...

1488
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:33,854
(SIGHS)
I found the Lord Almighty.

1489
00:59:33,979 --> 00:59:35,180
And, ever since then,

1490
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:38,025
my life has been
completely different. Okay?

1491
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:40,652
He's got a plan for each
and every one of us

1492
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:42,721
and, in his infinite wisdom,

1493
00:59:42,846 --> 00:59:45,498
he makes no mistakes. Hmm?

1494
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:46,867
You're right about that.

1495
00:59:46,992 --> 00:59:48,293
I think the Lord put you here because

1496
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:49,862
he wants me to get
something off my chest.

1497
00:59:49,987 --> 00:59:51,229
He wants me to clear my conscience

1498
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:53,198
and he wants me to ask for forgiveness.

1499
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:54,507
Robert.

1500
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:56,869
What I did to you at that
rally in senior year

1501
00:59:56,994 --> 00:59:58,311
was a cowardly act.

1502
00:59:58,436 --> 01:00:00,973
It's something that I've
regretted every single day.

1503
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:04,109
Yeah. I mean, bullying
is a national crisis.

1504
01:00:04,234 --> 01:00:09,156
It can leave people
with a lifetime of pain.

1505
01:00:09,281 --> 01:00:10,881
So...

1506
01:00:13,952 --> 01:00:18,131
I just want to say how truly sorry I am

1507
01:00:18,256 --> 01:00:20,868
for what happened, you know.

1508
01:00:20,993 --> 01:00:22,535
Or for what I did.

1509
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,129
It didn't just happen.
I did it.

1510
01:00:24,254 --> 01:00:27,199
I did it, and I wish to God
that I had not done it.

1511
01:00:27,324 --> 01:00:30,502
So, I'm hoping that you
can find it in your heart

1512
01:00:31,703 --> 01:00:33,839
to forgive me.

1513
01:00:35,207 --> 01:00:37,517
I wasn't expecting this at all.

1514
01:00:37,642 --> 01:00:39,377
Don't I know it.
I know it.

1515
01:00:40,578 --> 01:00:42,923
I'm just so happy.

1516
01:00:43,048 --> 01:00:45,450
Uh, I don't know what to say.

1517
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:47,219
How about you say...

1518
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:52,757
"The Oscar goes
to Trevor Olson."

1519
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,030
What do you mean?
(LAUGHING)

1520
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:07,147
Weird Dick!

1521
01:01:07,272 --> 01:01:08,782
You stupid ass!

1522
01:01:08,907 --> 01:01:10,617
Good God, you're dumb!

1523
01:01:10,742 --> 01:01:12,744
Dumber than ever, I guess!

1524
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:14,454
And you, too, Calvin!

1525
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:17,315
Look at that stupid look
on those two faces.

1526
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,318
"The Lord taught me to care."
Unbelievable.

1527
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:28,799
I'm a Scientologist.
Okay, that's "A."

1528
01:01:28,925 --> 01:01:31,120
And thetan-free since 2003.

1529
01:01:31,493 --> 01:01:32,603
Clear as shit.

1530
01:01:32,728 --> 01:01:34,030
And I'm sorry for what I did?

1531
01:01:34,155 --> 01:01:35,940
Let me tell you what I'm sorry about.

1532
01:01:36,065 --> 01:01:37,800
I'm sorry I didn't toss your naked
ass out there three more times.

1533
01:01:37,925 --> 01:01:39,201
It was the best senior prank ever.

1534
01:01:39,326 --> 01:01:40,903
I still get emails about it.

1535
01:01:41,028 --> 01:01:42,814
Know what?

1536
01:01:42,939 --> 01:01:44,740
You're going to regret you ever opened
your mouth. You hear me, Trevor?

1537
01:01:44,865 --> 01:01:46,250
Oh, yeah?
How come, Calvin?

1538
01:01:46,375 --> 01:01:48,244
Oh, because he's about to
whoop your ass, that's why.

1539
01:01:48,369 --> 01:01:49,153
Who is?

1540
01:01:49,278 --> 01:01:50,888
Bob, get up and whoop his ass.

1541
01:01:51,013 --> 01:01:52,748
Oh, here she comes!
Let me tell you something...

1542
01:01:52,873 --> 01:01:55,551
Weird Dick can't chug a bunch
of steroids and elk urine

1543
01:01:55,676 --> 01:01:56,986
and miraculously be able

1544
01:01:57,111 --> 01:01:59,355
to kick my ass all of a sudden, okay?

1545
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:00,823
It ain't gonna happen.

1546
01:02:00,948 --> 01:02:02,191
'Cause here's why.

1547
01:02:02,316 --> 01:02:06,403
Once a fat kid, always a fat kid.

1548
01:02:06,528 --> 01:02:07,638
Huh? Prove me wrong.

1549
01:02:07,763 --> 01:02:09,763
Bob, come on.
Do what you did in the bar.

1550
01:02:20,109 --> 01:02:22,219
Come on, hit me!

1551
01:02:22,344 --> 01:02:25,114
And I'll sue your ass, and
take your fanny pack away.

1552
01:02:25,239 --> 01:02:26,290
(BLOWS)

1553
01:02:26,415 --> 01:02:28,350
What's the matter with you?
I just want to go.

1554
01:02:28,475 --> 01:02:30,086
She wants to go.

1555
01:02:30,211 --> 01:02:32,730
Go ahead. There you go.

1556
01:02:32,855 --> 01:02:33,965
No, it's a push.

1557
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:36,233
Boy, 50-50 shot.
You missed that.

1558
01:02:36,358 --> 01:02:37,894
At least you found the handle.

1559
01:02:38,019 --> 01:02:40,304
Boy, he's still a scared little bitch.

1560
01:02:40,429 --> 01:02:41,964
You know, you're still an asshole.

01:02:42,089 --> 01:02:44,776
Yeah, well, you're still
shorter than my cat.

1562
01:02:44,901 --> 01:02:46,502
Here's your transaction number.

1563
01:02:46,627 --> 01:02:48,227
Hit it, Ant-Man.

1564
01:02:49,471 --> 01:02:51,140
(CLEARS THROAT)
Thank you, Trevor.

1565
01:02:51,265 --> 01:02:52,249
Yup.

1566
01:02:52,374 --> 01:02:54,410
Glad to see you haven't changed a bit.

Keep overwatch.

1894

I'll go down there
and check things out.

Wait, what?
No, I'm going with you.

1896

Well, you can't go with me.

1897
01:16:56,142 --> 01:16:57,719
The smarter play is if we split up.

1901
01:17:02,423 --> 01:17:03,867
I'd be the one to die.
You know why?

1902
01:17:03,992 --> 01:17:05,426
Because I don't have a bulletproof vest

1903
01:17:05,551 --> 01:17:06,770
and I don't have a gun!

1904
01:17:06,895 --> 01:17:08,772
Which means that you
are my bulletproof vest!

1905
01:17:08,897 --> 01:17:10,866
My little black ass is gonna stay
behind you, you're not leaving me!

1906
01:17:10,991 --> 01:17:12,734
That's exactly why
you should stay up here.

1907
01:17:12,859 --> 01:17:15,536
Look, if you went down in that
garage and you got shot to death

1908
01:17:15,661 --> 01:17:16,847
you know how hurt I would be?

1909
01:17:16,972 --> 01:17:18,606
I'd be super bummed out!
I don't want that.

1910
01:17:18,731 --> 01:17:20,350
It's safer for you up here.

what am I supposed to do, Bob?

2440
01:41:21,748 --> 01:41:22,682
What does that mean?

2441
01:41:22,807 --> 01:41:25,719
(STAMMERS)
What, you think Mr. T

2442
01:41:25,844 --> 01:41:26,795

You think those guys are real?

01:41:29,481 --> 01:41:30,965
That's a bunch of dumbass nicknames

2446
01:41:31,090 --> 01:41:32,192

2447
01:41:32,317 --> 01:41:34,361
