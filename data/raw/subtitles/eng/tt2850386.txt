00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:51,865
[all groan]

176
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,451
[groans]

177
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,621
- [snoring, exhaling]
- Oh!

178
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,249
Eep. Eep, are you awake?

179
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:01,333
Yeah.

180
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,168
Hold on. I'm coming over.

181
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:05,254
Aah!

182
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:07,631
Oh. Hey, Gran.

183
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:12,052
[snorts]

184
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:15,722
- [snorting continues]
- [shivers]

185
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,726
[grunting]

186
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,353
[gasps]

187
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,771
- Hi.
- Hi.

188
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:24,940
Can he hear us?

189
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,192
- Nah. Once he's out, he's out.
- Oh.

190
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,862
- Hey.
- Hey.

191
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:33,407
No, no. This is a "hey" with a question.
Um...

192
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,076
So, uh, I was thinking...

193
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:38,412
That's not my hand.

194
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,083
Anyway, uh...

195
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,961
I couldn't sleep.
I was thinking about Tomorrow.

196
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,671
Our Tomorrow.

197
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,215
Our Tomorrow?
What do you mean?

198
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:51,842
What I mean is, um,

199
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:57,514
maybe our Tomorrow is different
than the rest of... of the pack's.

200
00:09:57,598 --> 00:10:01,476
Maybe our Tomorrow is a place
of our own, you know?

201
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,563
Like a home. Just the two of us.

202
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,148
Just the two of us?

203
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:10,027
Hmm. Guy, I'd really miss my family.

204
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:14,031
But that does sound amazing!

205
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,532
A place of our own?

206
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,451
Our home?

207
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,620
Ooh! Can our home have flowers?

208
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,246
Sure can. And butterflies.

209
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,831
And a sweet, babbling brook?

210
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:24,499
And privacy.

211
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,293
Ooh! What's "privacy"?

212
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:29,713
It means you only smell the feet
you wanna smell.

213
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:30,797
Wow.

214
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,716
So, um...

215
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:37,304
do you, Eep Amber Crood,

216
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:40,599
think you could
spend your Tomorrow with me?

217
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:41,850
[gasps]

218
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:45,312
I do.

219
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,148
[stomach rumbling]

220
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:52,069
I'm going to fall asleep
and dream about our home.

221
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,987
- Good night, Guy.
- Good night, Eep.

222
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,034
Just the two of them?

223
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,374
Warping my baby's mind
with whispers and kisses.

224
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:09,378
"Can Grug hear us?"
Oh, yeah, Grug hears. Grug hears all.

225
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:12,005
All about your private
two-person house of Tomorrow,

226
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:15,092
whispering, kissing,
butter-babble-brooking.

227
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,678
[shouts] What the heck is that?

228
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:20,097
[snoring]

229
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:25,018
[stomach rumbling repeatedly]

230
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:26,603
Thunk,

231
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,230
make it stop.

232
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:30,440
[Ugga] Hit snooze!

233
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:31,608
Stop it, tummy.

234
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,444
[roars]

235
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,154
Another glorious morning. [grunts]

236
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:38,323
What's that? You wanna play?

237
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:39,575
Go get it, boy!

238
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:40,784
No, Sandy!

239
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,912
Mom! Sandy's fetching
Douglas's stick again.

240
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:45,038
[rustling]

241
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:47,249
[yelping]

242
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:48,542
Uh, what's that?

243
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,710
[growls]

244
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,044
Kill circle!

245
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,051
Safety off, babe.

246
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,136
Thanks.

247
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:06,143
Today is a good day to die!

248
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,438
Hey, everyone!
You'll never guess what I fo...

249
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,983
Oops. Sorry, honey.

250
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,194
We thought you were a predator
trying to kill us.

251
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:17,487
No, never apologize
for an effective kill circle.

252
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:20,365
You have to come see this.
Follow me! Come on. This way.

253
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:21,491
Whoo-hoo!

254
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,452
Yes! You're gonna love it!

255
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,204
- [laughs]
- [Chunky grumbles]

256
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,377
- Wow!
- Whoa.

257
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,388
Dun-dun-duh?

258
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:48,143
[Ugga] What is that?

259
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:50,562
[Eep] I've never seen anything like it.

260
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:53,398
[Thunk shrieks]

261
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,108
What is it, Mom? Make it leave.

262
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,402
There's something about this.

263
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,366
I think it's... the end of the world.

264
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,618
Looks like I've seen it all.

265
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,580
Well, that's it for me.
I'm glad it's you, Chunky.

266
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:10,958
[Grug] It's not the end.

267
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,793
[grunts]

268
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,795
It's just the beginning.

269
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:18,048
Welcome to our Tomorrow!

270
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,554
- [Guy] Whoa.
- [Eep] Wow!

271
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:24,638
[Ugga] Wow!

272
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,975
[all gasp]

273
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:29,935
Look at all this food!

274
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,603
Guy, are you seeing this?

275
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,814
You're the best dad ever! Let's eat!

276
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,899
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
One moment, Thunk.

277
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:39,069
Before we eat,
I'd like to say a few words.

278
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:43,991
Let this flag mark the day
I discovered our home,

279
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:47,494
filled with flowers, and butterflies,

280
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:49,162
and a sweet, babbling brook.

281
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:50,539
Huh?

282
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:53,250
Here, right here,
all your needs will be met...

283
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,544
- I'm hungry!
- [shouts] In a minute!

284
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:56,795
Go now! He's not looking.

285
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,797
- Whoa!
- Whoa. Ahh.

286
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:01,508
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Just a minute. Just a minute. One minute.

287
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,802
- [growling]
- No, no, no. Wait, wait. Just wait.

288
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:07,514
This is our home, a place we'll always
be together forever and ever,

289
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:08,849
and you're welcome!

290
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:10,517
[panting]

291
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:12,019
I did this.

292
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:13,353
Problem solved.

293
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:15,939
[stomach rumbling]
Whoo-hoo!

294
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:18,442
- [Thunk] Food!
- [laughs]

295
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:22,112
Isn't it strange how this food
grows in perfectly straight ro...

296
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:23,197
Ahh!

297
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,199
[all grunting]

298
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,075
Whoo-hoo!

299
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:31,121
[growls]

300
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:35,501
[laughs]

301
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:40,005
[all grunting, gulping]

302
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:46,428
[quiet lapping]

303
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:48,472
[laughing]

304
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:58,357
[all groaning]

305
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,651
I don't feel like eating anymore.

306
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:01,944
Mom, am I sick?

307
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:04,488
No, honey. You're full.

308
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,448
Full feels weird.

309
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:10,244
I can't eat another bite.

310
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:12,454
Wait.

311
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:16,875
Yes, I can.

312
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,044
Buh-nah-nuh.

313
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,379
Banana?

314
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:24,174
I tasted one once, long, long ago.

315
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:28,178
It was summer.
The sun was warm on my shoulders.

316
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,389
Flowers were in high bloom.

317
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:32,266
I was just a cub.

318
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:36,228
Well, I ate that banana in one bite.

319
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:40,858
And ever since, a day hasn't gone by
without me thinking about it.

320
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,861
What was it like, Father?
What was it like?

321
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,946
No words can describe it, Thunk.

322
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,283
No words are good enough.

323
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:52,870
We get it, Dad. Just grab the banana!

324
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:54,997
Come here, sweet thing.

325
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,374
[screaming]

326
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,835
[both shrieking]

327
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:06,550
[shrieking in distance]

328
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:11,138
[birds shrieking]

329
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:13,140
[groaning]

330
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:14,558
[tapping]

331
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:16,518
Do you guys hear that?

332
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,438
What is that?

333
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,693
What's happening? I can't see.

334
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:26,904
It's getting closer!

335
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:29,656
Kill circle?

336
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,953
Something got over the wall.

337
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:36,121
Don't get too close.

338
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:39,875
Who knows what kind of weird
beyond-the-wall creatures they are.

339
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,169
Let's just jab at them from afar.

340
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:43,504
- Jab!
- [Guy] Ow!

341
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:44,922
Jab, jab!

342
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,048
- [buzzes]
- [woman] Ah!

343
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,342
Wait a moment.

344
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:51,553
Look past the matted pelts
and gnashing teeth.

345
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:55,182
The eyes,
there's a kind of humanity in them.

346
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:57,476
Ba-na-na.

347
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,520
It's trying to communicate.

348
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:01,980
Hope, these are people!

349
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,818
Cave people.

350
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:09,488
I thought cave people died off years ago.

351
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:19,957
We happy meet you.

352
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,084
In hearts...

353
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,712
[together] ...much joy.

354
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:28,966
- Thanks.
- Much joy to you too.

355
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,301
Oh. They speak beautifully.

356
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:34,263
Oh, forgive our condescension, friend.

357
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:35,347
I'm Phil.

358
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,350
And I am Hope. And we are...

359
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:39,476
The Bettermans.

360
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,395
"Better man"?

361
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:43,313
- Betterman.
- Emphasis on the "better."

362
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:45,482
- Well, we're the Croods.
- [grunts]

363
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:47,234
- And this is...
- Guy?

364
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:49,444
Wow. Good guess.

365
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:51,905
Mr. and Mrs. Betterman?

366
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:53,907
- Guy!
- What-What's going on here?

367
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:55,951
- Oh, Guy.
- Guy. Guy!

368
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,828
Hope, it's Guy.

369
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,580
Guy, Guy, Guy.

370
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:01,206
What's going on here?

371
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,168
[Guy] I grew up with Hope and Phil.

372
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:06,837
They were
my parents' best friends until...

373
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,963
[Hope] Oh, Guy.

374
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,632
We thought we lost your whole family.

375
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:15,012
That was the moment we realized,
in such a dangerous world,

376
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,723
there had to be a better way to live.

377
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:20,893
Wha... [laughs]

378
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:22,311
Is that your home?

379
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:24,730
[Eep] Whoa! That's their home!

380
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,857
- [Gran] Whoa, mama!
- [Thunk] Look, Dad!

381
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,859
- Wow.
- [laughing]

382
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,611
Hey, Guy, race you to the top.

383
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:32,029
[grunting]

384
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:35,157
Oh, um, excuse me, little tiger girl?

385
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,618
- Uh, we don't climb this tree.
- Huh?

386
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:40,537
- There's a "Betterman" way.
- Unofficial motto.

387
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:43,081
- Ooh.
- Okay, everybody in?

388
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:44,666
- Ah!
- [purrs]

389
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,420
Yeah, the, um, death cat
will have to stay outside.

390
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:50,631
- See ya, Chunky.
- [yowls]

391
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:53,008
Sorry. Animals track in too much...

392
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:55,636
um, dirt.

393
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:56,803
Going up.

394
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:58,805
[Grug] Whoa! What's happening?

395
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:02,434
Oh.

396
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:04,520
[sighs]

397
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:06,772
Welcome to the Betterman home!

398
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:07,981
[all] Wow!

399
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:09,358
[Ugga] It's beautiful!

400
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:11,318
Kind of big, isn't it?

401
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:13,570
What?

402
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:18,659
Whoa! [chuckles] I can see the clouds!
But I'm inside.

403
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:20,869
What is this? What is this?

404
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:23,664
Uh, we call that a window.

405
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:26,708
[slowly] Window.

406
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:29,711
- [moans]
- Okay.

407
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:32,798
Guy, Dawn will be so happy to see you.

408
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,174
- Dawn?
- Dawn?

409
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:35,801
Yeah, yeah. We grew up together.

410
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:37,469
Oh, Dawn!

411
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:38,720
- Ahh!
- [shatters]

412
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:42,015
Oh. That's just your reflection.
It's called a mirror.

413
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:43,350
Oh, sorry.

414
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:44,476
Dawn!

415
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,602
[glass shatters]

416
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:47,563
- Sorry.
- Dawn!

417
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,189
Where is she?

418
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:51,817
- [Dawn] I'm in the panic cubby!
- Panic cubby!

419
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,528
Dawn, it wasn't wild animals.

420
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:56,154
It's safe to come out.

421
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:59,032
[gasps]

422
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:03,078
Mom, maybe we should drill some air holes
in the door of the panic cubby?

423
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:05,247
No air holes. Snakes could get in.

424
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,583
But you'll never believe
who we just found.

425
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:10,335
- Guy?
- Dawn?

426
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:12,671
Guy! Is it really you?

427
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,089
It's you! You're here!

428
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:18,010
[together] You're so old! So are you!
That's what I said! [laughing]

429
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:19,094
Oh, together again.

430
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:21,930
These two were inseparable
when they were young.

431
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:23,724
Inseparable.

432
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:25,309
Dawn's a girl?

433
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,895
[laughs, gasps]

434
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:30,314
Hold on, stop.
You accessorize with a sloth?

435
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:33,150
I accessorize with a sloth!
This is Belt!

436
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,526
[coos]

437
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:38,155
- [Dawn] Mine's Sash.
- Ooh la la.

438
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,157
Oh, oh! These are the Croods.

439
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,241
- Hello.
- Hey.

440
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:42,910
- 'Sup?
- And this...

441
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:44,411
Wait. Nope, nope.

442
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:45,871
Yeah. This is Eep.

443
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:47,748
- You're a girl?
- Yeah.

444
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:48,999
A girl...

445
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,375
friend!

446
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:52,628
I've never had a girlfriend before!

447
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:54,046
- Me either! Me either!
- Girlfriends!

448
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:55,464
Okay, careful! Small bones.

449
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:56,965
Extra vertebrae!

450
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:58,550
- This is amazing!
- What do we do?

451
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:00,761
- What do we say to each other?
- What's happening to our voices?

452
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:03,347
Why are our voices getting so high?
[squealing]

453
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,307
[howling]

454
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,935
[croaking]

455
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:11,980
As our houseguests,
you're welcome to anything you want.

456
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:14,858
[chuckles] I know what I want.

457
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:18,070
Uh, except for that. [chuckles]

458
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:19,988
But there's so many of them.

459
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:21,198
Uh, sorry, Grug.

460
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:24,159
I'm afraid we have one house rule here.

461
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:25,577
We don't eat the bananas.

462
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:26,787
But they're right here.

463
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,873
Anything else, anything at all,
is yours to enjoy.

464
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:32,960
But we don't eat the bananas.
[chuckles]

465
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:35,128
- Really?
- Heh?

466
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:37,422
- No bananas?
- Heh?

467
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:38,507
But...

468
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,467
We won't eat your bananas.

469
00:21:40,551 --> 00:21:42,469
[chuckles]
It's getting late, so...

470
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:44,972
Well, we can just sleep-pile right here.

471
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:47,182
Got it. Solid spot, Dad.

472
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:49,893
Look, Phil. They sleep in a pile.

473
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:51,895
- Ooh, fun!
- Nuh-uh.

474
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:54,857
Actually, everyone gets their own rooms.

475
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,401
[gasps] We get separate rooms!

476
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:59,528
- What's a room?
- What's a separate?

477
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:02,573
We Bettermans believe
that privacy promotes individuality.

478
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:04,032
Unofficial motto.

479
00:22:04,116 --> 00:22:08,412
Well, we Croods believe that
the pack sticks together no matter...

480
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:09,496
What?

481
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,290
Tell me about my room,
Mr. Better-dad.

482
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:13,292
Well, son, it's right this way.

483
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,378
It all started with a tree and an idea.

484
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:17,629
[groans]

485
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:23,051
- [Belt sighs]
- Wow. What a day.

486
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:25,554
I never thought
I'd see the Bettermans again.

487
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:26,847
- Hey, you!
- Hey.

488
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:27,931
Wow.

489
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:30,434
Sure beats the view
from any cave I know.

490
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:32,269
Yeah,
I can't believe this place.

491
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:34,688
[groans]

492
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:37,858
Oh, this bed is so comfortable.

493
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:38,984
[chirrups]

494
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,694
Ah, nobody's foot in my mouth.

495
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:43,280
So much better.

496
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:45,115
[giggles] Yeah.

497
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:51,371
So, is this that privacy thing
you were telling me about?

498
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:52,956
Just feels kind of...

499
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:55,709
far... you know?

500
00:22:57,336 --> 00:22:58,337
Guy?

501
00:22:58,837 --> 00:22:59,838
Guy?

502
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:01,590
[snoring]

503
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:02,758
Guy?

504
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:05,135
- [scraping]
- [grunts]

505
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:09,389
- Time to watch some late-night window.
- [barks]

506
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:11,767
Ooh, ooh. Check it out, Douglas.
This guy's my favorite.

507
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:16,522
Okay, moommoth. Whatcha gonna do now?

508
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:18,357
[groans, trumpets]

509
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,734
Oh! What an idiot!

510
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,611
[grunting]

511
00:23:23,946 --> 00:23:26,198
[snorting]

512
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:36,375
Ugga?

513
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:39,545
Ugga.

514
00:23:41,964 --> 00:23:43,423
[snoring lightly]

515
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:44,800
- Ugga!
- Kill circle!

516
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:47,469
Oh. Hey, honey.

517
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:49,221
Yeah, I couldn't sleep either.

518
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:52,599
All these separate rooms.
Who could live in a place like this?

519
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:53,684
Well...

520
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:57,271
And there's something off about that
Phil Betterman guy. Like, way off.

521
00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:59,356
Grug, you know what I think?

522
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,275
Maybe we could stay.

523
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:03,944
Excuse me?
You're thinking about staying here?

524
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:07,698
No. I want to be in the wild
fighting vulture rats for scraps.

525
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:09,575
- Of course I want to stay.
- Yeah, but...

526
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:10,951
- It's nice here.
- But...

527
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:14,079
And you were just worried about
your daughter leaving,

528
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:16,665
but the pack is together.

529
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:17,749
Sort of.

530
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:21,295
If you give this place a chance,
you might actually like it here.

531
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:23,297
[sighs]

532
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:25,257
Do I have to like Phil?

533
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,676
You have to be nice. No hitting.

534
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,636
Okay.

535
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,638
But if I have to be alone...

536
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:35,809
I'm gonna be alone with you.

537
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:39,104
[Hope] I mean, can you believe it?

538
00:24:39,188 --> 00:24:43,275
After all these years,
and Guy shows up on our doorstep.

539
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:47,237
And to think that we were worrying
about Dawn being alone.

540
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:48,572
And now Guy's back!

541
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:50,782
It's like fate
brought them back together.

542
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:52,659
Like it was meant to be.

543
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:57,539
But did you see the way
that cave girl was holding Guy's hand?

544
00:24:57,623 --> 00:24:58,457
Hmm.

545
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:02,252
You don't think Guy could possibly
be serious about that Meep?

546
00:25:02,336 --> 00:25:03,962
Or "Peep"? Or is it "Eep"?

547
00:25:04,046 --> 00:25:05,297
"Eep." It's "Eep," right?

548
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:09,426
Well, I'm just not sure
Eep fits in here. You know?

549
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:12,054
In fact, none of them do.

550
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:16,350
Poor things do seem to struggle
with the concept of walls.

551
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:19,561
I don't know if cave people
belong in a modern world.

552
00:25:19,645 --> 00:25:21,438
[Thunk] Aah! [laughs]

553
00:25:21,522 --> 00:25:23,815
I'm going to watch window forever!

554
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:25,776
Do they know that?

555
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,570
I feel like we just need to
help them understand

556
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:30,697
that they have a bright future...

557
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:32,324
outside these walls.

558
00:25:33,242 --> 00:25:34,284
[squeals, grunts]

559
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:37,913
And Guy's future is inside the walls.

560
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:39,748
With Dawn.

561
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:42,543
[Phil]
Hope Betterman, always thinking of others.

562
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:44,586
[Hope] Honestly, I just can't help it.

563
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:48,757
[rooster seal crows, barks]

564
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:54,888
- [Guy] Ooh, that was...
- [neck cracking]

565
00:25:54,972 --> 00:25:57,724
...hands down,
the best night's sleep I've gotten in...

566
00:25:57,808 --> 00:25:59,059
- Morning, Guy!
- Oh!

567
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:00,227
Hi, Mr. Betterman.

568
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,562
Fresh bitter bean juice?

569
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:04,189
Uh, thank you?

570
00:26:04,273 --> 00:26:06,233
- Hi, Guy!
- Ah! Mrs. Betterman.

571
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:08,694
These are for you.
I made them last night.

572
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:13,574
Oh, uh, I should wake Eep up.

573
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:16,535
You know, it's been seven hours
since I said, uh, "Hey."

574
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:18,453
That's adorable!

575
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:22,040
You know, let's let that poor Eep sleep.
She must be exhausted.

576
00:26:22,124 --> 00:26:24,209
- Nah, I'm sure she's...
- Oh, look!

577
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:27,004
Here's Dawn! What a coincidence.

578
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:30,632
Why, Dawn, whatever are you doing
on this particular rope bridge

579
00:26:30,716 --> 00:26:33,218
at this particular moment in time?

580
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:36,346
My morning chores?

581
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,056
Morning chores!

582
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:49,902
[squawks]

583
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:52,279
Genius.

[grunts]

585
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:58,160
Genius!

586
00:26:58,243 --> 00:26:59,369
Genius!

587
00:27:00,245 --> 00:27:01,330
Genius!

588
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:03,832
[chanting] Genius! Genius! Genius!

589
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:05,209
[croaking, squeals]

590
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:06,668
[laughs]

591
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:07,878
Genius.

592
00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:14,593
Genius. Mmm.

593
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:22,267
- Boom.
- Boom.

594
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:24,019
[groans] Couldn't sleep last night.

595
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:25,354
Me neither.

596
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:27,481
When I woke up,
your mom was missing.

597
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:29,900
You don't think
a predator took her, do you?

598
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:31,443
Nope. Found her.

599
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:34,404
[sighs]

600
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:37,533
It's like this place is changing everyone.

601
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:40,619
We don't sleep-pile anymore.
We don't wake up together.

602
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:43,455
And Thunk just stares at that box.

603
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:44,915
[Thunk] Ohh.

604
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:47,668
- [grunts]
- Not now, Douglas. The birds are on.

605
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:51,213
- [whines]
- Dad, relax. It's been one night.

606
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:53,590
And a little change can be... Guy?

607
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:58,554
- Hey.
- Guy?

608
00:27:58,637 --> 00:28:02,558
Wow. You're you,
but you don't look like you.

609
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:06,019
[sniffs] And you smell like flowers.

610
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:07,646
And soft rain.

611
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:09,857
More like a clear mountain stream.

612
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,775
With just a hint of vanilla.

613
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:14,444
It's called a shower.
You should try it.

614
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,406
You want me to smell like vanilla?

615
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:18,657
Just a hint.

616
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,367
What happened to your clothes?

617
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,578
We burned his clothes
while he was in the shower.

618
00:28:22,661 --> 00:28:26,790
In fact, they were so dirty
that we washed them and then burned them.

619
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:29,126
[laughing]

620
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:31,128
[slowed laughing]

621
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:35,007
Come on, Thunk. We're going outside.

622
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,342
[whines] I don't wanna.
I'm watching birds.

623
00:28:37,426 --> 00:28:40,387
In my day, we didn't stare at birds.
We fought them.

624
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,847
[Thunk] Let me live my life!

625
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,932
Hey, new friend girl!
Want some breakfast?

626
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:45,309
Uh, sure!

627
00:28:45,392 --> 00:28:47,060
Oh! I'll start the fire again.

628
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:48,187
Fire.

629
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:53,150
- ["True" plays]
- Hey.

630
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:54,693
Hey, yeah. Check this out.

- [music stops]
- [grunts]

632
00:28:58,447 --> 00:29:01,909
Now, that's how you make a fire.
You don't need two people anymore.

633
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:05,204
I can't believe how much time
I wasted clacking rocks. This is amazing!

634
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:08,457
And it's such a time-saver,
and it's so simple.

635
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,000
No more smashed fingers.

636
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:11,543
The Bettermans really do...

637

[animals squawking, birds calling]

638
00:29:20,928 --> 00:29:25,349
Oh, there you are.
I was looking all over for you.

639
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:28,727
Whoa. We are really up here!

640
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,480
Do I smell weird to you?

641
00:29:32,022 --> 00:29:34,525
[sniffs] You smell... different.

642
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:36,360
Like river rocks with, uh...

643
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:39,154
a hint of moss.

644
00:29:40,197 --> 00:29:41,907
Whoa! What's that mark on your wrist?

645
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,784
Oh, it's just a scar.

646
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:44,868
Scar?

647
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:47,412
Yeah, from a thorned crab.
No big deal.

648
00:29:47,496 --> 00:29:49,081
Whoa! And that?

649
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:50,707
Razor worm.

- Well, what about that one?
- Scorpion badger.

654
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:02,803
And my dad doesn't even know
about this one.

- Whoa. Peanut toe.

Every mark is an adventure!

657
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:12,855
My parents won't even let me have scars.

658
00:30:12,938 --> 00:30:15,899
That's why they built the wall.
To keep me safe.

659

You're not allowed outside the wall?

660
00:30:20,946 --> 00:30:24,366
Nope, not since
what happened to Guy's family.

661
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:27,828
So, this farm...

662

He spends a lot of time in there.

Anyway, here.

00:32:22,234 --> 00:32:23,652
Where does this go?

709
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:28,156
[Thunk] Dad, what if I miss something?
I wanna go back inside.

710
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,451
No, Thunk. Play with Douglas.
He's feeling left out.

711
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:34,788
And he's sad that everyone isn't
spending time together anymore.

712
00:32:34,872 --> 00:32:37,082
- [panting]
- [Thunk sighs]

713
00:32:37,165 --> 00:32:39,293
All right.
You wanna play fetch, Douglas?

714
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:42,796
- [barks]
- Yeah? Okay. Okay. Go get it!

715
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:44,840
- [shrieks]
- Oh!

716
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:47,259
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

717
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:49,344
I'm going back to the window!

718
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:51,263
[sighs]

719
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:53,390
[Phil] Hey! There he is!

720
00:32:53,473 --> 00:32:56,435
- [groaning]
- Grug! Over here, buddy.

721
00:32:56,518 --> 00:32:58,312
Let's go for a ride.

722
00:32:58,395 --> 00:33:00,397
Grug. Gruggers.

723
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,565
G-G-G-Grug.

724
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:02,649
Grug.

725
00:33:02,733 --> 00:33:04,276
[shrieks]

726
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:06,236
Grug? Grug.

727
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,030
Wanna go for that ride?

728
00:33:08,113 --> 00:33:09,907
Pretty impressive, eh, Grug?

729
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,241
Funny story,

730
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:16,997
everything you see before you used to be
a sad, hopeless, dust-filled wasteland.

731
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,498
That doesn't sound funny.

732
00:33:18,582 --> 00:33:20,834
But through the power of higher thought,

733
00:33:20,918 --> 00:33:25,297
I devised a way to get all the water
from that high mountain source

734
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,507
to flow down here.

735
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,799
[Grug] How interesting.

736
00:33:27,883 --> 00:33:31,428
Yup, I turned a barren desert
into a lush oasis.

737
00:33:31,512 --> 00:33:33,972
Now we have all the water we need
and then some.

738
00:33:34,056 --> 00:33:36,475
Matter of fact, we're thinking of
putting in a new...

739
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:38,435
- Ooh, banana.
- No!

740
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:39,728
Ow.

741
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:40,938
What'd you do that for?

742
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:44,525
Sorry. I'm afraid I must remind you
of our one rule.

743
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:46,360
We don't eat the bananas.

744
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:49,696
Well, why not?
I mean, they're everywhere!

745
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:53,116
Look! You got a whole bowl full of them
over there. Who are those for?

746
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,577
Grug, we could talk about fruit all day.

747
00:33:55,661 --> 00:33:56,870
Or...

748
00:33:56,954 --> 00:33:59,164
do you wanna see something really cool?

749
00:33:59,248 --> 00:34:00,499
[Grug] I don't know.

750
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:04,127
[squeals]

751
00:34:10,092 --> 00:34:11,552
[grunts]

752
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:16,639
Hey. Fixing yourself a snack?

753
00:34:16,723 --> 00:34:20,686
Oh, I thought I'd clean up a little.
Noticed we made a bit of a mess yesterday.

754
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:24,690
- Oh, no. I hadn't noticed.
- [flies buzzing]

755
00:34:24,773 --> 00:34:27,693
Um, you can just put that over there
in the compost bin.

756
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:29,777
Oh, smart.

757
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:34,574
Good job.

758
00:34:34,658 --> 00:34:38,161
Well, we didn't want you to think
we're a family of savages. [chuckles]

759
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:39,871
[trumpeting]

760
00:34:39,955 --> 00:34:41,831
[laughs] Savages.

761
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:43,750
Sandy, drop it.

762
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,210
- Drop it!
- [growls]

763
00:34:46,295 --> 00:34:48,088
Kids, right?

764
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:51,382
[clears throat] So, Ugga,
you must really miss the wild.

765
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:53,844
- Right? With the hunting...
- Not really.

766
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:56,263
- ...and the gathering...
- Not really.

767
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:58,182
...the baying at the moon.

768
00:34:58,265 --> 00:34:59,474
[howls]

769
00:34:59,558 --> 00:35:00,893
Not at all.

770
00:35:00,976 --> 00:35:03,604
Honestly, it sucks out there.

771
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:07,441
If no one's died before breakfast,
it's a win. [chuckles]

772
00:35:07,524 --> 00:35:10,277
It is so much better in here.

773
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,570
[voice trembles] Oh.

774
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:12,821
That's nice.

775
00:35:14,406 --> 00:35:15,449
Yeah.

776
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:19,536
Actually, Grug and I were thinking
that maybe we...

777
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,289
Ah! I almost forgot. I made this for you.

778
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:23,832
- A basket?
- Mm-hmm.

779
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:26,877
Well, it's more like-like a travel basket.

780
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,337
Travel basket?

781
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,838
Yeah, for the road.

782
00:35:29,922 --> 00:35:34,301
It's got fruit, nuts, soap, more soap
and a neck pillow.

783
00:35:34,843 --> 00:35:38,639
Oh. Yeah. This'll be great...
for the road.

784
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:40,766
Thank you.

785
00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:43,810
It's the least we can do
to thank you for bringing Guy home.

786
00:35:43,894 --> 00:35:45,187
- Home?
- Home.

787
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,271
Guy?

788
00:35:46,355 --> 00:35:47,689
Guy's home. You got it.

789
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:49,858
Well, gotta go.
See you at dinner, okay?

790
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:54,154
[grunts]

791
00:35:55,656 --> 00:35:58,575
- [screaming]
- Yeah!

792
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:02,204
[Dawn laughing] Whoo!

793
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:04,414
Ooh!

794
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:06,250
Huh? Whoa!

795
00:36:08,252 --> 00:36:12,047
Whoa. [laughs]

796
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:15,384
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

797
00:36:17,302 --> 00:36:18,554
Yeah!

798
00:36:19,805 --> 00:36:22,266
[drumming, choir vocalizing]

799
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:24,101
- [gasps]
- Whoa!

800
00:36:30,566 --> 00:36:32,693
[laughs]

801
00:36:33,944 --> 00:36:35,696
[both laughing]

802
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:37,906
Ooh!

803
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:40,951
- [laughing]
- Ahh! Eep!

804
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:45,622
- Eep?
- [groaning]

805
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:48,500
[shouting]

806
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,753
[groans]

807
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:55,340
[grunting]

808
00:36:56,758 --> 00:37:00,137
- [growls]
- [laughs]

809
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,724
[gasps] Ow.

810
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:06,310
I have a scar.

811
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:07,436
You have a scar!

812
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:09,271
- I have a scar!
- Yeah!

813
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:10,522
Ow!

814
00:37:11,315 --> 00:37:13,233
[whistling]

815
00:37:13,317 --> 00:37:16,278
[groans] Don't tell Mrs. Betterman,

816
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:19,948
but while she thinks
I'm toiling in the hot sun,

817
00:37:20,032 --> 00:37:21,867
I'm actually in here,

818
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,368
my man cave.

819
00:37:23,994 --> 00:37:26,580
[sighs] It's hot in here.

820
00:37:26,663 --> 00:37:30,626
Grug, you might be more comfortable
if you removed your fur pelt.

821
00:37:30,709 --> 00:37:32,044
I-I already did.

822
00:37:32,878 --> 00:37:33,879
Right.

823
00:37:33,962 --> 00:37:38,550
Yeah, it's a place a father
can escape the chaos of family life.

824
00:37:38,634 --> 00:37:41,136
Relax, hang with his bros,

825
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,722
if bros he has.

826
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:45,390
Another shark milk?

827
00:37:45,474 --> 00:37:50,145
So, you come in here
to hide from your family?

828
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:53,690
Not hide, help. I help my family.

829
00:37:53,774 --> 00:37:55,901
[slurps, sighs]

830
00:37:57,486 --> 00:38:00,239
So, uh,

831
00:38:00,322 --> 00:38:01,865
how does this help your family?

832
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:03,325
Yeah. [sighs]

833
00:38:03,408 --> 00:38:07,829
This is where I find solutions
to my family's biggest problems.

834
00:38:07,913 --> 00:38:09,164
[steam hissing]

835
00:38:09,248 --> 00:38:10,415
Okay.

836
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:14,044
So, feeling relaxed? Comfortable?

837
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:16,547
Susceptible to suggestion?

838
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,423
[hissing continues]

839
00:38:18,507 --> 00:38:20,092
What's your problem, big guy?

840
00:38:20,175 --> 00:38:22,177
[grunts] I don't have a problem.

841
00:38:22,261 --> 00:38:24,721
Come on, Grug.
I've seen you moping around.

842
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:25,848
What's your problem?

843
00:38:25,931 --> 00:38:27,933
I'm hot. That-That's my problem.

844
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:29,393
Knock, knock.

845
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:32,688
I'm knocking on the door, big guy.
Open it.

846
00:38:32,771 --> 00:38:34,439
- No.
- [steam whistles]

847
00:38:34,523 --> 00:38:36,775
- Open up to me.
- No.

848
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:40,028
- Share with me.
- Uh-uh. I don't wanna. I'm hot.

849
00:38:40,112 --> 00:38:41,405
[Phil] Tell me your problem.

850
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:42,906
I don't have a problem.

851
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,449
You have a problem.

852
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:46,743
Tell me your problem. [echoing]

853
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:48,161
- I don't...
- Tell me.

854
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:49,121
- I don't...
- Tell me.

855
00:38:49,204 --> 00:38:50,539
- I don't...
- Tell me. Tell me.

856
00:38:50,622 --> 00:38:52,708
I don't like it here, all right?

857
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:55,586
My pack's all split up.
There's no one to sleep-pile with.

858
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:57,754
You won't let me eat bananas.

859
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:00,632
Guy gave Eep a rock.
He kissed my hand.

860
00:39:00,716 --> 00:39:02,843
They're planning on leaving the pack.

861
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:04,428
And I don't like you at all!

862
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:06,638
Hmm. Now, that's interesting.

863
00:39:06,722 --> 00:39:09,808
You know, maybe I just
need to get to know you better.

864
00:39:09,892 --> 00:39:12,853
No, not that.
The part about Eep and Guy.

865
00:39:12,936 --> 00:39:16,064
Oh. Guy's trying to take my daughter away.

866
00:39:16,148 --> 00:39:19,276
Father to father,
I worry about my daughter too.

867
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,112
She was so lonely
before Guy came back.

868
00:39:22,196 --> 00:39:23,322
Yeah.

869
00:39:23,405 --> 00:39:25,908
It's almost like Guy's the problem.

870
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:29,328
Wait a minute. Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

871
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:31,205
Yes. No.

872
00:39:31,288 --> 00:39:32,873
I don't know. Hot.

873
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:34,625
- Are you suggesting...
- [steam hissing]

874
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:38,378
...we take Guy off your hands
so Dawn isn't lonely,

875
00:39:38,462 --> 00:39:41,381
and Eep stays with you,
with your pack?

876
00:39:42,382 --> 00:39:44,218
Uh, am I?

877
00:39:44,301 --> 00:39:47,262
Why, Grug, that's a truly great idea.

878
00:39:47,346 --> 00:39:49,932
You've done it!
You've solved both our problems.

879
00:39:50,474 --> 00:39:53,060
[laughs] No. Really?

880
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:54,770
So, we have a deal, bro?

881
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,523
Deal.

882
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:06,198
Hey, Ugga!
I just had the best time with Phil!

883
00:40:06,281 --> 00:40:09,409
Look at me.
Standing up straight, got lots of ideas.

884
00:40:09,493 --> 00:40:11,078
You know, Phil's a good listener.

885
00:40:11,161 --> 00:40:14,456
He knows a smart idea
when he hears... one.

886
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:19,044
Heh.

887
00:40:19,127 --> 00:40:22,756
[sighs] The Bettermans want us
to leave without Guy.

888
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,134
- Oh, um... You think so, huh?
- As if we would ever do that.

889
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:28,136
- Well...
- Guy's a member of our pack.

890
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,221
Kind of.

891
00:40:29,304 --> 00:40:32,599
And can you imagine what that would do
to Eep? It would absolutely destroy her!

892
00:40:32,683 --> 00:40:34,142
Well, initially.

893
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:36,228
They think we're just simple cave people.

894
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:39,481
That we're so stupid,
we'd trade Guy for a fruit basket.

895
00:40:40,315 --> 00:40:43,151
And then she tried to
make me think it was my idea!

896
00:40:43,235 --> 00:40:46,446
- That is a great idea.
- Betterman.

897
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,365
[Ugga] As if we'd ever do that!

898
00:40:48,448 --> 00:40:50,617
- So we have a deal?
- Betterman.

899
00:40:50,701 --> 00:40:52,703
[Ugga] They must think
we're pretty stupid.

900
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:55,831
You've done it, Grug. Thinking man.
You're not stupid.

901
00:40:55,914 --> 00:40:57,457
- Betterman!
- Betterman!

902
00:40:58,166 --> 00:40:59,751
- [grunting] Betterman!
- Betterman!

903
00:41:00,669 --> 00:41:02,963
- [slurring]
- Betterman!

904
00:41:04,381 --> 00:41:06,884
[roaring]

905
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:08,927
Maybe we should
take it down a notch, honey.

906
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:10,512
- [mumbles]
- [repeats mumble]

907
00:41:10,596 --> 00:41:14,141
We gotta focus. We've gotta get Guy
and get out of here.

908
00:41:14,224 --> 00:41:15,851
Okay. But first,

909
00:41:15,934 --> 00:41:20,355
there's something I've wanted to do
for a really, really long time.

910
00:41:24,985 --> 00:41:28,614
Ah. I can't believe they kept
these old picture albums.

911
00:41:28,697 --> 00:41:30,490
That's the Bettermans.

912
00:41:30,574 --> 00:41:34,453
Okay, this is my mom,
this is my dad, and that's me.

913
00:41:34,536 --> 00:41:35,913
[laughing]

914
00:41:35,996 --> 00:41:37,873
Yeah, I get it. I was skinny.

915
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:44,713
[sighs] It's pretty great here, huh, Belt?

916
00:41:45,672 --> 00:41:46,882
[rustling]

917
00:41:46,965 --> 00:41:48,300
- [giggling]
- Shh!

918
00:41:55,307 --> 00:41:57,935
[all grunting] Whee!

919
00:41:58,018 --> 00:42:00,270
Shh. [giggles]

920
00:42:00,896 --> 00:42:02,147
[shoes tapping]

921
00:42:02,231 --> 00:42:04,733
Is that my dad? Hide me!

922
00:42:04,816 --> 00:42:06,026
Mr. Betterman?

923
00:42:07,486 --> 00:42:08,612
"Mr. Betterman"?

924
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:12,282
[blows raspberry]
It's just Guy. Hi, Guy!

925
00:42:12,366 --> 00:42:13,575
Hey, you.

926
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:16,078
- Where'd you go?
- Took Chunky for a joyride.

927
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:18,288
- Joyride!
- [gasps] Joyride?

928
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:19,831
We rolled the death...

929
00:42:19,915 --> 00:42:21,333
- Outside the wall.
- ...cat!

930
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:24,837
You took Dawn for a joyride

931
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,630
- outside the wall?
- Yeah.

932
00:42:26,713 --> 00:42:28,882
The Bettermans don't want Dawn
outside the wall.

933
00:42:28,966 --> 00:42:32,386
They built the wall for a reason,
you know, to keep everyone safe.

934
00:42:32,469 --> 00:42:33,804
Guy, relax.

935
00:42:33,887 --> 00:42:37,516
Yeah, Guy, take it down low.

936
00:42:38,267 --> 00:42:39,309
What's wrong with her?

937
00:42:39,393 --> 00:42:41,144
It's just a reaction to the bee venom.

938
00:42:41,228 --> 00:42:43,438
- Bee venom?
- Bee venom!

939
00:42:43,522 --> 00:42:44,648
What the...

940
00:42:45,774 --> 00:42:47,609
- It's just a little bee sting.
- "Little"?

941
00:42:47,693 --> 00:42:50,696
Hey, you're not the boss of me.

942
00:42:50,779 --> 00:42:51,905
This is a very severe...

943
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:53,282
- Shh.
- [giggles]

944
00:42:53,365 --> 00:42:56,243
Eep, this is a very severe bee sting!

945
00:42:56,326 --> 00:42:58,453
- "This is a very severe bee sting."
- She's fine.

946
00:42:58,537 --> 00:42:59,830
No, no. She's not fine.

947
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:01,582
- I'm fine.
- Dawn!

948
00:43:01,665 --> 00:43:05,377
Eep, that was not smart.
She could have been seriously hurt.

949
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,379
You gotta think about these things!

950
00:43:07,462 --> 00:43:10,048
Why are you acting like this?
You like adventures.

951
00:43:10,132 --> 00:43:13,635
No! No. I like not dying.
Things are different now.

952
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:15,888
But she needed to get out.

953
00:43:15,971 --> 00:43:18,557
She's just like me.
This is her cave!

954
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,185
No, she's not like you.
This is not her cave!

955
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:22,644
She's not a cave girl.

956
00:43:24,605 --> 00:43:26,023
"Cave girl"?

957
00:43:31,069 --> 00:43:33,447
What does he mean by "cave girl"?

958
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:35,324
I'll give him a cave girl!

959
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:40,704
[grunting]

960
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:46,251
I trust you've all brought your appetites.

961
00:43:46,335 --> 00:43:48,504
Chef Hope's been working hard all day.

962
00:43:48,587 --> 00:43:51,632
Mmm.
This is so good, Mrs. Better-mom.

963
00:43:52,216 --> 00:43:54,468
You're eating the flower arrangement.

964
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:58,013
Wow.

965
00:43:58,096 --> 00:44:00,933
Uh, Grug, Ugga,
what can we offer you?

966
00:44:01,016 --> 00:44:02,142
Ah, we're good.

967
00:44:02,226 --> 00:44:04,811
Yeah, we ate a little something
on the way over.

968
00:44:04,895 --> 00:44:06,939
[burps] Oops. Pardon me.

969
00:44:07,022 --> 00:44:08,398
- Eh...
- [grunting]

970
00:44:08,482 --> 00:44:09,608
Okay.

971
00:44:09,691 --> 00:44:10,692
Oh, look!

972
00:44:10,776 --> 00:44:12,945
- Oh!
- Guy and Dawn are here...

973
00:44:13,028 --> 00:44:14,780
- [blows raspberry]
- ...together.

974
00:44:14,863 --> 00:44:16,365
[giggles]

975
00:44:16,448 --> 00:44:17,824
You good to do this?

976
00:44:17,908 --> 00:44:19,952
Just try to keep your giant hand
out of sight.

977
00:44:20,035 --> 00:44:21,119
- Gotcha!
- Ah!

978
00:44:21,203 --> 00:44:22,204
[giggles]

979
00:44:22,287 --> 00:44:24,331
- [branches breaking]
- [grunting]

980
00:44:24,414 --> 00:44:26,083
[grunts]

981
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:29,044
Oh, welcome, Eep.
Your seat is over here, next to...

982
00:44:29,127 --> 00:44:30,128
Gran.

983
00:44:31,922 --> 00:44:34,800
We're not done.
You called me a cave girl.

984
00:44:34,883 --> 00:44:37,553
But y-y-you are a cave girl.

985
00:44:37,636 --> 00:44:38,846
[blows raspberry]

986
00:44:38,929 --> 00:44:42,015
But you said "cave girl"
like it's a bad thing.

987
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:45,269
What's wrong with cave people, Guy?

988
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:47,104
There's nothing wrong with cave people.

989
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:48,897
Can I get you a towel
or a utensil or something?

990
00:44:48,981 --> 00:44:50,691
[gulping]

991
00:44:50,774 --> 00:44:51,775
[burps]

992
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:53,110
I'm good.

993
00:44:53,193 --> 00:44:54,528
Why are you acting like this?

994
00:44:54,611 --> 00:44:56,530
I'm just acting like a cave girl, Guy.

995
00:44:56,613 --> 00:44:58,615
But I guess that's not good enough
for you anymore.

996
00:44:58,699 --> 00:44:59,741
I never said that.

997
00:44:59,825 --> 00:45:02,578
Grug, let's take this moment
to talk about your great idea.

998
00:45:02,661 --> 00:45:03,745
Uh, what?

999
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:05,622
Grug felt, and I concurred,

1000
00:45:05,706 --> 00:45:09,001
that Guy should be
with his kind of people, evolved people.

1001
00:45:09,084 --> 00:45:10,794
And Eep should stay with her kind.

1002
00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:13,839
- So we made a deal.
- Say again?

1003
00:45:13,922 --> 00:45:14,965
- What deal?
- His deal!

1004
00:45:15,799 --> 00:45:17,801
- Your idea.
- Your idea?

1005
00:45:17,885 --> 00:45:20,304
Guy stays with us,
and Eep stays with her pack.

1006
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:21,680
Grug's words, not mine.

1007
00:45:21,763 --> 00:45:24,099
- You tried to get rid of me?
- Really, Dad?

1008
00:45:24,183 --> 00:45:25,601
No! Honey, I don't think that.

1009
00:45:25,684 --> 00:45:27,978
I mean, he made me think
that I thought that.

1010
00:45:28,061 --> 00:45:29,479
He tricked me!

1011
00:45:29,563 --> 00:45:31,607
He took me
into his stupid secret man cave,

1012
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:32,983
and he tricked me.

1013
00:45:33,066 --> 00:45:34,401
What's a man cave?

1014
00:45:34,484 --> 00:45:37,196
It's a place I go to get away.

1015
00:45:37,279 --> 00:45:38,488
Away from what?

1016
00:45:38,572 --> 00:45:40,574
Away from you! Duh!

1017
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:42,743
- What?
- We're all thinking it.

1018
00:45:42,826 --> 00:45:44,703
- How dare you?
- How dare you!

1019
00:45:44,786 --> 00:45:46,246
How dare the both of you!

1020
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:48,832
- [gasps]
- You're trying to fix me up with Guy?

1021
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:50,334
What happened to your hand?

1022
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:52,211
Oh. I got stung by a bee. Oh!

1023
00:45:52,294 --> 00:45:53,921
Outside the wall. [giggles] Oh!

1024
00:45:54,004 --> 00:45:56,423
- You went outside the wall?
- Outside the wall?

1025
00:45:56,507 --> 00:45:58,717
- This is all your fault!
- Oh! Our fault?

1026
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,801
Can I say something?

1027
00:45:59,885 --> 00:46:01,011
- [all] No!
- Okay.

1028
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:03,180
I can't believe
you actually made that deal.

1029
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:05,724
- What did they do to you?
- I got [deep voice] scars.

1030
00:46:05,807 --> 00:46:07,017
Our baby!

1031
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,477
[Grug] It was really hot.

1032
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,355
I was full of shark milk.
I was naked!

1033
00:46:11,438 --> 00:46:13,023
Why, Phil? Why?

1034
00:46:13,106 --> 00:46:16,944
Because privacy promotes individuality!
Unofficial motto!

1035
00:46:17,027 --> 00:46:19,571
Well, kiddo, looks like
we all have something to hide.

1036
00:46:19,655 --> 00:46:21,281
- [hisses]
- [screams]

1037
00:46:21,365 --> 00:46:24,409
[shouting]

1038
00:46:24,493 --> 00:46:26,745
That's it! Come on, Guy. We're leaving.

1039
00:46:26,828 --> 00:46:29,456
Wait, hold on a second.
First, you wanted to get rid of me, Grug,

1040
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,250
and now you want me to come with you?

1041
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:32,835
You were trying to take my daughter away!

1042
00:46:32,918 --> 00:46:36,129
Promising my baby girl butterflies
and babbling brooks.

1043
00:46:36,213 --> 00:46:37,506
Aha!

1044
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:39,341
You see? I knew you were listening.

1045
00:46:39,424 --> 00:46:41,301
There is no privacy with you people.

1046
00:46:41,385 --> 00:46:43,387
Oh, you mean cave people?

1047
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:44,555
Not what I said.

1048
00:46:44,638 --> 00:46:48,684
Positives, Eep, that's all I'm saying.
Lots of things here are better.

1049
00:46:48,767 --> 00:46:53,063
- "Better"?
- Like not starving, no sleep pile.

1050
00:46:53,146 --> 00:46:57,401
- What's wrong with the sleep pile?
- Oh, come on, Eep! The sleep pile reeks!

1051
00:46:57,484 --> 00:46:58,735
Reeks of love!

1052
00:46:58,819 --> 00:47:01,822
Well, at least I smell like me.
[sniffing]

1053
00:47:01,905 --> 00:47:04,032
I don't even know what you smell like.

1054
00:47:04,116 --> 00:47:05,701
Flowers and soft rain.

1055
00:47:05,784 --> 00:47:07,619
I don't even know who you are anymore!

1056
00:47:07,703 --> 00:47:10,747
With your vanilla
and your stupid neck rock!

1057
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:13,542
It's this place. This place is...

1058
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:16,044
Home! This place is home!

1059
00:47:16,753 --> 00:47:17,754
"Home"?

1060
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:20,424
This is the place
my parents wanted me to find!

1061
00:47:20,507 --> 00:47:22,259
This is Tomorrow.

1062
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:27,472
[sighs] Well, clearly,
I don't belong in this Tomorrow.

1063
00:47:29,683 --> 00:47:31,268
I'm leaving.

1064
00:47:31,351 --> 00:47:32,561
Are you coming with me?

1065
00:47:33,437 --> 00:47:34,438
I, um...

1066
00:47:35,397 --> 00:47:36,523
I can't.

1067
00:47:40,068 --> 00:47:42,321
Then I guess we have
two different Tomorrows.

1068
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:50,871
Eep.

1069
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:53,207
[footsteps departing]

1070
00:47:57,544 --> 00:48:00,881
[pops lips]
So, who's ready for dessert?

1071
00:48:00,964 --> 00:48:02,090
I told you,

1072
00:48:02,174 --> 00:48:04,635
we're not hungry!

1073
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:06,261
You ate a banana?

1074
00:48:06,345 --> 00:48:09,473
Nuh-uh. We ate all the bananas.

1075
00:48:10,098 --> 00:48:13,685
[chuckles] That's impossible.

1076
00:48:13,769 --> 00:48:15,687
Not for cave people.

1077
00:48:16,355 --> 00:48:17,981
What have you done?

1078
00:48:18,065 --> 00:48:20,067
They're just bananas, Phil.

1079
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:22,611
"Just bananas"?
"Just bananas," she says!

1080
00:48:22,694 --> 00:48:24,321
That was my one rule!

1081
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:26,823
Wait, we're not done.

1082
00:48:26,907 --> 00:48:29,201
There was more
I was planning on saying to you!

1083
00:48:29,952 --> 00:48:33,205
Mrs. Better-mom,
I'll just take my dessert at the window.

1084
00:48:33,789 --> 00:48:36,917
You kidding me?
I've lived with her family for how long?

1085
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,087
With the... With the dirt and the smell.

1086
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:44,216
- [howling]
- Eep? Eep, is that... you?

1087
00:48:44,299 --> 00:48:47,052
[sobbing]

1088
00:48:47,135 --> 00:48:48,512
I don't know.

1089
00:48:48,595 --> 00:48:50,097
[sobbing continues]

1090
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:52,474
- Did you hit him?
- No.

1091
00:48:52,558 --> 00:48:53,725
I thought about it.

1092
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:57,104
The bananas were key to our survival.

1093
00:48:57,187 --> 00:49:02,609
The bananas were keeping us safe.
[wails]

1094
00:49:02,693 --> 00:49:04,319
Safe from what?

1095
00:49:04,403 --> 00:49:08,323
[branches snapping, leaves rustling]

1096
00:49:08,407 --> 00:49:09,783
[Phil] It's here...

1097
00:49:09,867 --> 00:49:11,451
for the bananas!

1098
00:49:11,535 --> 00:49:12,911
What is, Phil?

1099
00:49:12,995 --> 00:49:15,914
It has come every night
for 100 moons or more.

1100
00:49:18,959 --> 00:49:22,171
<i>I found bananas are the only thing
that keeps it at bay.</i>

1101
00:49:25,549 --> 00:49:27,134
[yelps]

1102
00:49:27,217 --> 00:49:28,969
What's on the other side
of the wall, Phil?

1103
00:49:29,052 --> 00:49:32,723
[Phil]
<i>Night after night, it was never enough!</i>

1104
00:49:36,226 --> 00:49:37,227
[gasps]

1105
00:49:37,311 --> 00:49:41,231
It wants its bananas!

1106
00:49:41,315 --> 00:49:43,650
What's behind the wall, Phil?

1107
00:49:44,193 --> 00:49:45,277
What is it, Phil?

1108
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,945
[yelps]

1109
00:49:47,029 --> 00:49:49,031
- What are the bananas for?
- What is it?

1110
00:49:49,114 --> 00:49:51,700
I don't know!

1111
00:49:54,828 --> 00:50:00,834
[screams]

1112
00:50:03,086 --> 00:50:04,087
Huh?

1113
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:07,799
It's just a little punch monkey.

1114
00:50:07,883 --> 00:50:10,594
- I'm leaving.
- [laughing]

1115
00:50:10,677 --> 00:50:12,888
You just kept giving it bananas?

1116
00:50:12,971 --> 00:50:15,390
[laughing continues]

1117
00:50:15,474 --> 00:50:17,559
Wait, wait. Let me understand something.

1118
00:50:18,352 --> 00:50:21,396
You had no idea you were working...

1119
00:50:22,898 --> 00:50:24,399
for an itty-bitty monkey?

1120
00:50:25,067 --> 00:50:31,615
Giving it bananas for years!
[laughs]

1121
00:50:34,201 --> 00:50:38,956
[rhythmic punching]

1122
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:42,668
[gasps]

1123
00:50:42,751 --> 00:50:43,794
That's not good.

1124
00:50:43,877 --> 00:50:46,296
- [monkey shrieks]
- [shouting]

1125
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,590
[Grug] No, no, no! Get away!

1126
00:50:50,342 --> 00:50:51,343
Phil!

1127
00:50:51,426 --> 00:50:52,803
[yelps]

1128
00:50:54,388 --> 00:50:57,182
[repeating]
Come on, come on, come on!

1129
00:50:57,266 --> 00:50:58,892
[Guy screams]

1130
00:51:04,857 --> 00:51:08,861
Oh, Douglas, those flowers
did not agree with me.

1131
00:51:08,944 --> 00:51:10,779
- What'd I miss?
- [whines]

1132
00:51:12,447 --> 00:51:15,409
Hey, Mrs. Better-mom,
wasn't there a wall there before?

1133
00:51:15,492 --> 00:51:16,493
[gasps]

1134
00:51:19,204 --> 00:51:20,205
Phil?

1135
00:51:20,289 --> 00:51:22,332
Dad? Guy?

1136
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:23,458
Grug?

1137
00:51:23,542 --> 00:51:25,252
[Belt, Sash whine]

1138
00:51:25,335 --> 00:51:26,587
[Hope] It's gone.

1139
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:29,131
The wall is gone. Phil's gone.

1140
00:51:29,214 --> 00:51:32,259
Oh, my gosh. Something has taken him,
taken all of them.

1141
00:51:32,342 --> 00:51:33,635
What are we gonna do?

1142
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:37,014
No sign of them.
But I did find this though.

1143
00:51:37,097 --> 00:51:39,725
- Is that my basket?
- Good eye.

1144
00:51:39,808 --> 00:51:42,060
Sandy can track them with this.

1145
00:51:42,144 --> 00:51:43,437
Sandy, seek.

1146
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,563
[sniffs]

1147
00:51:44,646 --> 00:51:45,647
[Hope] Okay, right.

1148
00:51:45,731 --> 00:51:48,692
You guys go, and Dawn and I
will stay here and fix the wall.

1149
00:51:48,775 --> 00:51:52,029
Or better yet, Dawn, let's get you
back inside your panic cubby.

1150
00:51:52,112 --> 00:51:54,781
In fact, I think we can both fit
if we suck it in.

1151
00:51:54,865 --> 00:51:57,117
- [howls]
- She's got the scent.

1152
00:51:57,201 --> 00:51:58,952
[Ugga] Whatever took them
couldn't have gotten far.

1153
00:51:59,036 --> 00:52:01,246
[sighs] Mom,

1154
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:02,831
I'm going too.

1155
00:52:02,915 --> 00:52:06,418
Dawn, listen to yourself!
We are not like them.

1156
00:52:06,502 --> 00:52:08,003
Dad needs us.

1157
00:52:08,086 --> 00:52:09,796
Wait. Dawn!

1158
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,219
[grunts]
Dawn, you'll need the travel basket.

1159
00:52:15,302 --> 00:52:16,595
It has a neck pillow.

1160
00:52:17,179 --> 00:52:18,889
Where are you taking us? [grunts]

1161
00:52:18,972 --> 00:52:20,015
Stop talking!

1162
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:22,559
[Phil] If you're going to eat us,

1163
00:52:22,643 --> 00:52:25,437
you should eat the fat one first.
He ate your bananas.

1164
00:52:25,521 --> 00:52:27,231
[Grug] Oh, don't you blame me for this.

1165
00:52:27,314 --> 00:52:29,274
- [Phil] This is all your fault!
- [Grug] My fault?

1166
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:30,692
Tell him, Guy!

1167
00:52:30,776 --> 00:52:33,570
[Guy] She says I changed. [chuckles]

1168
00:52:33,654 --> 00:52:36,365
I didn't change!
This is the real me, baby!

1169
00:52:36,448 --> 00:52:38,367
- You know? You know what I'm saying?
- [growls]

1170
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:41,495
What you see, that's what you get.
That's what you...

1171
00:52:41,578 --> 00:52:43,372
There you are. I lost you for a second.

1172
00:52:43,455 --> 00:52:45,332
Anyway, I don't need anybody.
No one at all.

1173
00:52:45,415 --> 00:52:49,378
Ow! Fine! Wasn't much
of a conversation anyway.

1174
00:52:49,461 --> 00:52:52,506
Guess it's just me with my thoughts.

1175
00:52:52,589 --> 00:52:53,841
Travel log.

1176
00:52:53,924 --> 00:52:56,343
Literally, I'm traveling in a log.

1177
00:52:56,426 --> 00:52:58,470
So, it's been a while. A little update.

1178
00:52:58,554 --> 00:53:00,180
[Guy narrating] <i>Remember that Tomorrow?</i>

1179
00:53:00,264 --> 00:53:02,975
<i>You know, the one
I spent my whole life looking for?</i>

1180
00:53:03,058 --> 00:53:06,812
<i>Well, turns out, the girl I love
wants nothing to do with it...</i>

1181
00:53:06,895 --> 00:53:07,896
<i>or me.</i>

1182
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,649
<i>Girls, very, very complicated.</i>

1183
00:53:10,732 --> 00:53:13,485
[Eep narrating] <i>Dear diary. Hey, it's me.</i>

1184
00:53:13,569 --> 00:53:15,571
- <i>Remember what I said about fate?</i>
- [thunderclap]

1185
00:53:15,654 --> 00:53:18,490
<i>Well, fate's dumb and a liar</i>.

1186
00:53:18,574 --> 00:53:20,784
<i>Fate thinks it's better than you.</i>

1187
00:53:20,868 --> 00:53:22,911
<i>Fate wants to stay with...</i>

1188
00:53:22,995 --> 00:53:26,540
[Guy] <i>The Bettermans! They're amazing.
I mean, have you seen their tree house?</i>

1189
00:53:26,623 --> 00:53:29,168
[Eep]
<i>What's so great about living in a tree?</i>

1190
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:31,712
[Guy] <i>Showers, instant fire,
so much food, and...</i>

1191
00:53:31,795 --> 00:53:33,213
[Eep, mocking] <i>"Privacy."</i>

1192
00:53:33,297 --> 00:53:34,631
<i>Well, one thing's clear.</i>

1193
00:53:34,715 --> 00:53:36,258
- It's over!
- ...over!

1194
00:53:36,341 --> 00:53:37,467
- Fine!
- Fine!

1195
00:53:37,551 --> 00:53:38,802
- Who cares?
- Not me.

1196
00:53:38,886 --> 00:53:42,806
[both scoff repeatedly]

1197
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:45,517
[scoffing continues]

1198
00:53:45,601 --> 00:53:48,520
Are you okay?

1199
00:53:48,604 --> 00:53:51,273
- Huh?
- [groans] It's so bright out here.

1200
00:53:51,356 --> 00:53:54,359
I just need to watch the window for a...
I just need to watch it for a minute!

1201
00:53:54,443 --> 00:53:55,777
[growls]

1202
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,280
Oh.

1203
00:53:58,363 --> 00:54:00,282
Hey, my travel basket!

1204
00:54:00,365 --> 00:54:03,076
[sighs] Travel window.

1205
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:07,080
Ugga, can you tell your son to keep
his grubby hands off my stuff, please?

1206
00:54:07,164 --> 00:54:09,875
Listen, I feel really bad
about what happened at dinner

1207
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:12,461
with my parents, and you, and Guy.

1208
00:54:12,544 --> 00:54:14,046
Oh. [scoffs]

1209
00:54:14,129 --> 00:54:16,965
Please, I'm good. It's in the past!

1210
00:54:18,342 --> 00:54:21,178
You know, Guy and I, we're too different.

1211
00:54:21,261 --> 00:54:25,849
Well, you and I are different,
and we get along great, right?

1212
00:54:25,933 --> 00:54:27,309
Yeah, yeah.

1213
00:54:27,392 --> 00:54:29,645
But it's-it's complicated.

1214
00:54:29,728 --> 00:54:31,313
He's a boy.

1215
00:54:31,396 --> 00:54:34,483
He is... um... stupid.

1216
00:54:34,566 --> 00:54:35,817
You know, it's different.

1217
00:54:35,901 --> 00:54:38,320
What's the matter? Boy problems?

1218
00:54:38,403 --> 00:54:41,740
Well, in my day,
we didn't have boy problems.

1219
00:54:41,823 --> 00:54:46,578
Because we didn't have any boys,
or men, or clothes.

1220
00:54:46,662 --> 00:54:50,499
We were a warrior tribe of wimmins.

1221
00:54:50,582 --> 00:54:53,210
The Thunder Sisters!

1222
00:54:53,293 --> 00:54:54,461
[gasps]

1223
00:54:54,545 --> 00:54:56,463
What's a Thunder Sister?

1224
00:54:56,547 --> 00:54:59,341
Just Gran's old bedtime stories.

1225
00:54:59,424 --> 00:55:00,676
True stories!

1226
00:55:00,759 --> 00:55:04,137
Okay. Dawn, stop talking
to the crazy lady. Whoa!

1227
00:55:04,763 --> 00:55:07,224
We aren't actually
gonna cross that, are we?

1228
00:55:07,307 --> 00:55:09,184
Yes. Sandy's tracking the scent.

1229
00:55:09,268 --> 00:55:11,645
Well, there's gotta be another way.
You know?

1230
00:55:11,728 --> 00:55:16,275
Maybe one that's stable
and not infested with land sharks!

1231
00:55:16,358 --> 00:55:17,359
[Ugga] Tell you what,

1232
00:55:17,442 --> 00:55:21,071
you be in charge of gift baskets,
and I'll be in charge of tracking the men.

1233
00:55:21,154 --> 00:55:22,155
We cross!

1234
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:25,576
[gasps]
Oh, no, no, no. We are not crossing this!

1235
00:55:25,659 --> 00:55:27,828
[Ugga] My cat, my rules. We cross!

1236
00:55:28,412 --> 00:55:30,497
- Maybe we should take a vote?
- Around!

1237
00:55:30,581 --> 00:55:32,749
- Whoa!
- Cross!

1238
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:34,209
Around!

1239
00:55:34,793 --> 00:55:36,712
- [Ugga] Cross!
- [Hope] No!

1240
00:55:40,465 --> 00:55:41,633
[Ugga] Sandy, come!

1241
00:55:41,717 --> 00:55:43,343
[purrs, yelps]

1242
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:47,347
Thank you, Hope. This is so much safer.

1243
00:55:47,431 --> 00:55:50,058
[monkeys chirping]

1244
00:55:50,142 --> 00:55:51,602
[Phil] I can't see!

1245
00:55:51,685 --> 00:55:52,978
What's happening?

1246
00:55:53,061 --> 00:55:54,730
[Guy] Where are they taking us?

1247
00:55:54,813 --> 00:55:57,357
Hold tight, Guy.
As soon as we get out of this log,

1248
00:55:57,441 --> 00:56:00,360
I'll start swinging and punching
our way to freedom.

1249
00:56:00,444 --> 00:56:02,613
[screams]

1250
00:56:05,908 --> 00:56:09,536
Come on, punch monkeys! Let's get this on!

1251
00:56:11,914 --> 00:56:12,915
[groans]

1252
00:56:12,998 --> 00:56:15,375
[grunting]

1253
00:56:16,043 --> 00:56:17,127
[sighs]

1254
00:56:17,211 --> 00:56:19,671
It's-It's not just punch monkeys.

1255
00:56:19,755 --> 00:56:20,923
It's kick monkeys,

1256
00:56:21,006 --> 00:56:23,550
headbutt monkeys, low-blow monkeys,

1257
00:56:23,634 --> 00:56:25,594
bite monkeys, ab-tight monkeys!

1258
00:56:25,677 --> 00:56:28,138
Shoulders that punch! Tails that crunch!

1259
00:56:28,222 --> 00:56:31,350
Deranged stranglers! Strange danglers!
Fanged manglers!

1260
00:56:31,433 --> 00:56:33,685
Mouth-breathers! Brain squeezers!

1261
00:56:33,769 --> 00:56:35,479
And a dude with...

1262
00:56:36,104 --> 00:56:37,147
weird eyes.

1263
00:56:38,649 --> 00:56:39,733
[high-pitched] Mmm.

1264
00:56:41,985 --> 00:56:44,571
[chirping]

1265
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,241
[growls]

1266
00:56:49,201 --> 00:56:51,328
[hooting]

1267
00:56:52,829 --> 00:56:54,164
[growls]

1268
00:56:55,666 --> 00:56:57,084
Hmm.

1269
00:56:57,167 --> 00:57:00,337
They seem to have
some kind of primitive language.

1270
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:02,673
But you can't speak it,
huh, smarty-pants?

1271
00:57:02,756 --> 00:57:06,051
Well, no. But I'm sure
after a few months in captivity...

1272
00:57:06,134 --> 00:57:09,179
I can talk to them.
I'm fluent in punch monkey.

1273
00:57:09,263 --> 00:57:10,931
- You are?
- Impossible.

1274
00:57:11,014 --> 00:57:13,892
Oh, I really don't want to do this.
It's not a pretty language.

1275
00:57:15,769 --> 00:57:18,689
[clears throat]
Pardon me, I'd like to ask...

1276
00:57:20,941 --> 00:57:22,484
Hmm.

1277
00:57:23,193 --> 00:57:24,570
- [shrieks]
- Uh-huh.

1278
00:57:24,653 --> 00:57:26,446
- Ooh! I see.
- [Grug] So, what's he saying?

1279
00:57:27,281 --> 00:57:31,326
They're angry because
Phil broke the terms of their contract!

1280
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:34,454
Ludicrous! We had no formal agreement,
you chiselers!

1281
00:57:34,538 --> 00:57:37,249
Oh! Also, they want their bananas.

1282
00:57:37,332 --> 00:57:41,420
Yeah, bananas are delicious.
Why is that our problem?

1283
00:57:41,503 --> 00:57:43,505
And one more question.

1284
00:57:45,966 --> 00:57:47,926
- [knuckles cracking]
- [grunts]

1285
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:51,388
Many moons ago,
their world was a paradise.

1286
00:57:51,471 --> 00:57:53,348
[groans] This is gonna be a long story.

1287
00:57:53,849 --> 00:57:56,226
[Guy narrating]
<i>"It was a time of much joy.</i>

1288
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:58,395
<i>The water flowed freely.</i>

1289
00:57:58,478 --> 00:58:00,731
<i>The bananas grew in bunches.</i>

1290
00:58:00,814 --> 00:58:03,483
- <i>We had art, politics...</i>
- [shrieking]

1291
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:05,611
- <i>...economics...</i>
- Ooh.

1292
00:58:05,694 --> 00:58:07,696
<i>...but most of all, bananas.</i>

1293
00:58:07,779 --> 00:58:09,990
<i>So many bananas.</i>

1294
00:58:10,073 --> 00:58:11,950
<i>Then, at full moon,</i>

1295
00:58:12,034 --> 00:58:14,119
<i>the monster came for its bananas.</i>

1296
00:58:14,912 --> 00:58:16,705
<i>Yep. Good times."</i>

1297
00:58:16,788 --> 00:58:19,499
- Wait. Um, go back.
- Yeah. Did he say "monster"?

1298
00:58:19,583 --> 00:58:22,169
We are not going back!
As I was saying...

1299
00:58:22,252 --> 00:58:23,587
[narrating continues] <i>"Good times.</i>

1300
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:27,925
<i>But then, for some strange reason,
the water went away.</i>

1301
00:58:28,008 --> 00:58:31,053
<i>After that, the bananas went away too.</i>

1302
00:58:31,136 --> 00:58:33,597
<i>But the monster didn't go away. No.</i>

1303
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,600
- <i>It came back for its bananas.</i>
- [monster groaning]

1304
00:58:36,683 --> 00:58:38,185
<i>There were no bananas."</i>

1305
00:58:39,228 --> 00:58:43,440
[shrieking]

1306
00:58:44,983 --> 00:58:48,445
In summary,
they really need those bananas.

1307
00:58:49,029 --> 00:58:50,864
Monsters, bananas.

1308
00:58:50,948 --> 00:58:55,118
I'll tell you what their problem is.
Their water supply is dried up.

1309
00:58:55,202 --> 00:58:57,120
Tell them this word-for-word, Guy.

1310
00:58:57,204 --> 00:59:01,166
I, Phil Betterman, single-handedly
turned a desert into an oasis

1311
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:04,002
by diverting water
from a high mountain source,

1312
00:59:04,086 --> 00:59:06,547
much like that... one.

1313
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:08,048
Wait, Guy, don't translate that.

1314
00:59:10,008 --> 00:59:11,093
[monkeys gasp]

1315
00:59:11,176 --> 00:59:13,595
- Too late.
- [shrieks]

1316
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:16,515
It was all him!

1317
00:59:16,598 --> 00:59:19,685
He stole your water, ate your bananas
and ruined your society!

1318
00:59:21,061 --> 00:59:24,106
That's it! I will not be pelted!

1319
00:59:25,315 --> 00:59:27,818
Now, impertinent apes...

1320
00:59:27,901 --> 00:59:30,529
- [gasps]
- ...meet the full force of my intellect.

1321
00:59:30,612 --> 00:59:35,033
Look upon Betterman the toolmaker
and despair!

1322
00:59:35,117 --> 00:59:36,285
Jab, jab.

1323
00:59:37,703 --> 00:59:39,204
[all] Ooh!

1324
00:59:46,587 --> 00:59:47,754
[chanting] Jab, jab, jab.

1325
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:49,423
Way to go, Phil.

1326
00:59:50,632 --> 00:59:53,468
[Ugga] Way to go, Hope. We lost the scent.

1327
00:59:57,097 --> 00:59:59,558
No, no, no! Travel window!

1328
01:00:00,142 --> 01:00:02,186
Come on, come on. Whoo!

1329
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:03,770
It still works, everybody!

1330
01:00:03,854 --> 01:00:06,732
We are lost.

1331
01:00:06,815 --> 01:00:10,360
This is why you don't follow cave people.
One more word out of...

1332
01:00:10,444 --> 01:00:13,906
We have forgotten the old ways,

1333
01:00:13,989 --> 01:00:17,826
the ways of the world when it was young,
and I was young,

1334
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:24,917
when I was the queen matriarch
of a warrior tribe of wimmins.

1335
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,543
The Thunder Sisters.

1336
01:00:26,627 --> 01:00:29,880
You got it, girl.
The Thunder Sisters.

1337
01:00:29,963 --> 01:00:33,550
We faced down danger
and kicked death in the crotch!

1338
01:00:33,634 --> 01:00:38,013
We don't need the Thunder Sisters, Mom.
We need a way to find the men!

1339
01:00:38,096 --> 01:00:39,932
Oh, a way?

1340
01:00:40,015 --> 01:00:43,143
The Thunder Sisters always find a way!

1341
01:00:43,227 --> 01:00:45,479
Think you got one more flight
in you, old girl?

1342
01:00:45,562 --> 01:00:46,563
[caws]

1343
01:00:48,398 --> 01:00:49,775
Oh, my goodness.

1344
01:00:52,361 --> 01:00:54,821
Fly, Wigasus, fly!

1345
01:00:54,905 --> 01:00:56,448
- [shrieks]
- Go.

1346
01:00:56,532 --> 01:00:58,325
Go and find them, Wigasus.

1347
01:01:00,077 --> 01:01:01,578
That is it!

1348
01:01:01,662 --> 01:01:03,747
You are all crazy!

1349
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:06,542
And you know what?
That hair's not coming back. It escaped.

1350
01:01:06,625 --> 01:01:08,544
Which is what we need to be doing,
Dawn.

1351
01:01:08,627 --> 01:01:11,547
Getting away from these crazy...
cave people!

1352
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:12,631
Mom!

1353
01:01:12,714 --> 01:01:15,050
You came barging
into our lives uninvited,

1354
01:01:15,133 --> 01:01:18,428
without even wiping
your disgusting... feet!

1355
01:01:18,512 --> 01:01:19,721
[yelps]

1356
01:01:19,805 --> 01:01:23,308
And peeping Thunk over here,
with his dumb... window.

1357
01:01:23,392 --> 01:01:25,060
[groans] This show is for older kids.

1358
01:01:25,143 --> 01:01:27,479
And that flea-infested rat baby!

1359
01:01:27,563 --> 01:01:29,231
- Mmm?
- You dumb baby.

1360
01:01:29,314 --> 01:01:30,816
Okay. I'm gonna kill her.

1361
01:01:30,899 --> 01:01:32,609
Hey, hey, hey. Chill.

1362
01:01:32,693 --> 01:01:34,069
And you!

1363
01:01:34,152 --> 01:01:38,031
Taking my daughter outside the wall,
giving her scars and stupid ideas!

1364
01:01:38,115 --> 01:01:40,284
Mom!
Don't talk to my friend that way.

1365
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:41,994
And I'm glad Guy came to his senses

1366
01:01:42,077 --> 01:01:44,204
and realized he doesn't belong
with a cave girl.

1367
01:01:44,288 --> 01:01:46,540
He belongs with us,
the Bettermans!

1368
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,083
Let's go, Dawn!

1369
01:01:48,166 --> 01:01:49,960
Mom, where are you going?

1370
01:01:50,043 --> 01:01:52,212
[Hope] Got to get away!

1371
01:01:53,297 --> 01:01:54,548
Cave people!

1372
01:01:54,631 --> 01:01:59,136
[screams]

1373
01:02:01,763 --> 01:02:03,015
Oh, no.

1374
01:02:03,098 --> 01:02:04,766
[growls]

1375
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:07,186
What is that?

1376
01:02:10,022 --> 01:02:11,273
[gasps]

1377
01:02:14,735 --> 01:02:16,445
[shouts]

1378
01:02:16,528 --> 01:02:17,529
Eep!

1379
01:02:20,574 --> 01:02:22,201
Get him, Eep! Get him!

1380
01:02:23,285 --> 01:02:24,870
- [Dawn] Mom!
- [Ugga] There she is!

1381
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:28,999
[Gran] We're coming for you, ice lady!

1382
01:02:29,625 --> 01:02:30,918
[barks]

1383
01:02:34,671 --> 01:02:36,006
- [barks]
- [yelps]

1384
01:02:40,135 --> 01:02:42,304
- [growls]
- Kill circle!

1385
01:02:42,387 --> 01:02:45,474
Come on, stabby. Time to get stabbing.

1386
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:49,853
[yelps]

1387
01:02:49,937 --> 01:02:50,979
[whimpers]

1388
01:02:51,605 --> 01:02:53,440
- [growls, whines]
- Guys, wait a minute.

1389
01:02:53,524 --> 01:02:55,317
Everyone lower your weapons.

1390
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,819
Dawn. What is she doing?

1391
01:02:57,903 --> 01:02:59,488
Trust her. Lower your weapons.

1392
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:01,114
[growls]

1393
01:03:01,198 --> 01:03:02,783
[whimpers]

1394
01:03:02,866 --> 01:03:05,327
Come here, little guy.
You can come out.

1395
01:03:06,828 --> 01:03:08,956
Yeah. It's okay. You got it.

1396
01:03:12,167 --> 01:03:13,710
This isn't a monster.

1397
01:03:13,794 --> 01:03:15,003
It's a mom

1398
01:03:15,087 --> 01:03:19,424
who was just afraid for her baby
and being protective,

1399
01:03:19,508 --> 01:03:22,177
and maybe a bit, uh, rude.

1400
01:03:22,261 --> 01:03:26,181
And maybe she just didn't realize

1401
01:03:26,265 --> 01:03:30,352
that the outsiders weren't a threat
but actually...

1402
01:03:30,435 --> 01:03:31,812
friends.

1403
01:03:31,895 --> 01:03:33,397
And that maybe,

1404
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:37,150
the wolf spiders and outsiders
could live in beautiful harmony together

1405
01:03:37,234 --> 01:03:39,361
- in their tree house!
- [whines]

1406
01:03:39,444 --> 01:03:40,779
I mean ice cave.

1407
01:03:41,822 --> 01:03:42,823
Whoa.

1408
01:03:42,906 --> 01:03:46,368
You got all that
just from looking at them?

1409
01:03:46,451 --> 01:03:51,290
Perhaps the window
by which I view the world is flawed.

1410
01:03:52,499 --> 01:03:54,459
[chuckles] I'm gonna go pet them.

1411
01:03:54,543 --> 01:03:56,086
- [laughs]
- [growls]

1412
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:57,963
Oh, look,
they're hugging me with their teeth!

1413
01:03:58,046 --> 01:03:59,214
Ow!

1414
01:04:08,307 --> 01:04:09,600
[sighs]

1415
01:04:10,184 --> 01:04:12,186
- [Eep] Guy.
- Eep?

1416
01:04:12,269 --> 01:04:14,563
- Guy.
- Eep, you came back!

1417
01:04:14,646 --> 01:04:15,856
[Eep] No.

1418
01:04:16,565 --> 01:04:18,066
You made your choice.

1419
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:21,820
- No. That's not what I wanted!
- Enjoy your... Tomorrow!

1420
01:04:21,904 --> 01:04:23,697
Eep! Come back!

1421
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:24,781
No!

1422
01:04:24,865 --> 01:04:26,408
[panting]

1423
01:04:30,412 --> 01:04:32,372
[shouts, grunts]

1424
01:04:32,456 --> 01:04:34,833
[grunting]

1425
01:04:36,084 --> 01:04:39,922
Grug, do you mind?
I'm trying to think!

1426
01:04:40,005 --> 01:04:44,510
Well, I'm trying to get out of here
before that monster shows up!

1427
01:04:45,886 --> 01:04:48,263
There's no monster,
you bonehead.

1428
01:04:48,347 --> 01:04:51,058
They just want to... scare us.

1429
01:04:51,141 --> 01:04:52,142
That's it!

1430
01:04:52,226 --> 01:04:55,771
Time to strike fear
into the hearts of these apes.

1431
01:04:58,190 --> 01:04:59,441
[yelps]

1432
01:05:01,318 --> 01:05:03,070
[growling]

1433
01:05:03,153 --> 01:05:07,616
Look upon Betterman the fire maker
and despair!

1434
01:05:07,699 --> 01:05:08,700
Flame, flame!

1435
01:05:09,535 --> 01:05:11,954
[shrieking]

1436
01:05:12,037 --> 01:05:14,665
Great. Now they have spears and fire.

1437
01:05:14,748 --> 01:05:17,167
Guy, he just gave the monkeys fire!

1438
01:05:18,043 --> 01:05:19,211
[shrieks]

1439
01:05:21,588 --> 01:05:23,006
[cries]

1440
01:05:24,675 --> 01:05:26,176
[yelps]

1441
01:05:28,762 --> 01:05:29,930
[panting]

1442
01:05:30,013 --> 01:05:33,100
- You ready? And shake.
- [barks]

1443
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:34,685
Oh. And shake!

1444
01:05:35,227 --> 01:05:36,228
[barking continues]

1445
01:05:36,311 --> 01:05:38,856
And shake, and shake, and shake,
and shake, and shake!

1446
01:05:38,939 --> 01:05:41,650
Hey, Gran?
Are you sure this is safe?

1447
01:05:41,733 --> 01:05:44,820
Don't worry. It won't hurt... much.

1448
01:05:44,903 --> 01:05:48,323
- Where's Eep?
- She went off to get more firewood.

1449
01:05:48,407 --> 01:05:50,826
- I'm gonna go find her.
- Ugga, help me.

1450
01:05:50,909 --> 01:05:52,494
[Gran] Shh.

1451
01:05:52,578 --> 01:05:53,912
Eep?

1452
01:05:53,996 --> 01:05:55,873
- [Gran laughs]
- Eep?

1453
01:05:56,999 --> 01:05:59,251
[shouting]

1454
01:05:59,835 --> 01:06:00,961
[shouts]

1455
01:06:03,922 --> 01:06:05,090
[grunts]

1456
01:06:06,967 --> 01:06:09,428
[panting, growls]

1457
01:06:11,013 --> 01:06:12,306
Oh, hey!

1458
01:06:12,389 --> 01:06:13,432
I'm just...

1459
01:06:13,932 --> 01:06:15,684
I'm just getting some firewood.

1460
01:06:18,604 --> 01:06:20,606
[Ugga] I think you've got it covered.

1461
01:06:20,689 --> 01:06:24,109
Do you wanna take a break
from beating up the forest?

1462
01:06:26,111 --> 01:06:29,114
- [rumbles]
- [grunts]

1463
01:06:31,158 --> 01:06:32,951
Are you ready to talk about it?

1464
01:06:34,286 --> 01:06:35,329
[sighs]

1465
01:06:38,916 --> 01:06:43,795
I can't believe
he would choose a tree over me.

1466
01:06:43,879 --> 01:06:46,256
I don't think it's that simple.

1467
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:49,760
Guy knew the Bettermans
when he was little.

1468
01:06:49,843 --> 01:06:52,679
They're the closest thing
he has to a family.

1469
01:06:55,098 --> 01:06:57,601
Every time I've been hurt before...

1470
01:06:58,727 --> 01:07:02,147
I've gotten a mark I can see.

1471
01:07:02,231 --> 01:07:05,567
This hurts so much,

1472
01:07:05,651 --> 01:07:07,736
and I can't even see it.

1473
01:07:07,819 --> 01:07:09,530
I can see it.

1474
01:07:10,489 --> 01:07:13,033
[sniffs] Doesn't matter.

1475
01:07:13,116 --> 01:07:14,910
We're just too different.

1476
01:07:15,702 --> 01:07:17,204
I don't even care.

1477
01:07:18,038 --> 01:07:21,583
Eep, if something hurts this much,

1478
01:07:21,667 --> 01:07:23,710
maybe it means you do care.

1479
01:07:24,461 --> 01:07:27,840
Maybe it's something worth fighting for.

1480
01:07:29,216 --> 01:07:32,344
So, what are you gonna do about it?

1481
01:07:35,347 --> 01:07:38,851
[shivering]

1482
01:07:40,018 --> 01:07:43,522
Mom, you sure you don't wanna join us?
It's really warm in here.

1483
01:07:43,605 --> 01:07:46,066
Uh, I'm not really a sleep-pile person.

1484
01:07:46,149 --> 01:07:50,404
I have a shawl to keep me... warm.
That's okay.

1485
01:07:50,487 --> 01:07:53,907
I'll just use the travel basket
to shield mys...

1486
01:07:53,991 --> 01:07:55,868
Aw, come on!

1487
01:07:57,494 --> 01:08:00,414
[yelps]

1488
01:08:04,418 --> 01:08:06,879
- [panting]
- It's cozy, isn't it?

1489
01:08:06,962 --> 01:08:09,047
- Mmm.
- Told ya.

1490
01:08:10,215 --> 01:08:11,300
[sighs]

1491
01:08:13,886 --> 01:08:16,054
Hey, um, Ugga?

1492
01:08:16,638 --> 01:08:18,223
- Eep?
- Hmm?

1493
01:08:18,307 --> 01:08:19,850
Hi.

1494
01:08:19,933 --> 01:08:22,019
I just wanna say, um...

1495
01:08:23,312 --> 01:08:25,647
that I have been terrible.

1496
01:08:25,731 --> 01:08:32,029
After everything I did and said,
you still saved me.

1497
01:08:32,112 --> 01:08:33,113
Why?

1498
01:08:33,697 --> 01:08:36,533
Well, we always say
the pack stays together.

1499
01:08:37,117 --> 01:08:38,285
Unofficial motto.

1500
01:08:38,368 --> 01:08:39,703
It's okay.

1501
01:08:40,453 --> 01:08:45,000
- No. It is not okay. I was awful.
- It's fine.

1502
01:08:45,082 --> 01:08:47,002
- I tried to steal Guy from you.
- It's okay.

1503
01:08:47,085 --> 01:08:50,255
And I gave you
a passive-aggressive basket.

1504
01:08:50,339 --> 01:08:51,381
Yeah, that was weird.

1505
01:08:51,465 --> 01:08:53,008
Who does that?

1506
01:08:53,091 --> 01:08:58,180
And your daughter, obviously,
is not a rat baby.

1507
01:08:58,263 --> 01:08:59,555
She's beautiful.

1508
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:03,894
She is a beautiful human baby.

1509
01:09:03,977 --> 01:09:05,520
- And...
- [Gran] Enough!

1510
01:09:06,854 --> 01:09:10,108
[shrieking]

1511
01:09:15,531 --> 01:09:16,698
Where's Guy?

1512
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:20,243
- I think I'm his new pet.
- [growls]

1513
01:09:20,327 --> 01:09:22,621
Oh, that's rough.

1514
01:09:23,622 --> 01:09:24,665
[yelping]

1515
01:09:25,707 --> 01:09:27,125
What's he saying, Guy?

1516
01:09:27,209 --> 01:09:29,877
The aged wise one has decreed,

1517
01:09:29,962 --> 01:09:32,631
because we have no bananas
for the monster,

1518
01:09:32,714 --> 01:09:35,216
you will be...

1519
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:37,719
I think I can translate from here, Guy.

1520
01:09:37,803 --> 01:09:43,140
They're saying the oafish caveman
will grow bananas for them,

1521
01:09:43,225 --> 01:09:46,270
watering the fields with his bitter tears.

1522
01:09:46,353 --> 01:09:50,314
Oh. And naturally,
they want me to supervise.

1523
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:51,399
Not what they said.

1524
01:09:51,483 --> 01:09:53,193
You can't speak punch monkey.

1525
01:09:53,277 --> 01:09:54,570
Can I not?

1526
01:09:54,653 --> 01:09:59,783
{\an8}Monkeys, I have mastered your zesty
and expressive language.

1527
01:09:59,867 --> 01:10:00,909
{\an8}[Guy] No, you haven't.

1528
01:10:00,993 --> 01:10:06,039
{\an8}Let me talk a little punch monkey.
Phil Betterman is so smart, he's stupid!

1529
01:10:06,123 --> 01:10:09,209
{\an8}Oh, what do you have to say
to this witty rejoinder?

1530
01:10:10,752 --> 01:10:13,172
{\an8}[chuckles]
You know what? Let me fix this.

1531
01:10:13,255 --> 01:10:15,591
Do you mind? Can I take this? Thanks.

1532
01:10:15,674 --> 01:10:17,676
- Do not interrupt me!
- You stop interrupting me!

1533
01:10:17,759 --> 01:10:20,262
Will you two stop it?
I'm trying to get us out of this!

1534
01:10:20,345 --> 01:10:22,973
I'm in good with these monkeys.
I have a job!

1535
01:10:23,056 --> 01:10:24,892
And you two, you're gonna mess it up!

1536
01:10:24,975 --> 01:10:26,268
Like you mess up everything!

1537
01:10:26,351 --> 01:10:30,189
Like you messed up
my beautiful teenage romance.

1538
01:10:30,272 --> 01:10:32,524
[crying]

1539
01:10:33,483 --> 01:10:37,738
Guy, son, please understand.

1540
01:10:37,821 --> 01:10:39,656
It's Grug's fault.

1541
01:10:40,324 --> 01:10:41,325
[shouts]

1542
01:10:41,408 --> 01:10:42,784
Huh?

1543
01:10:42,868 --> 01:10:45,245
- [Phil] Get him, Guy!
- [Guy] I am not on your side!

1544
01:10:45,329 --> 01:10:47,122
- Yeah, he's with me!
- I'm not on yours either!

1545
01:10:48,957 --> 01:10:50,209
Oh.

1546
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:54,421
I recognize those broad shoulders.

1547
01:10:54,505 --> 01:10:57,049
Oh, Eep, you came for me. Boop.

1548
01:10:57,132 --> 01:10:58,800
- [growls]
- Ah!

1549
01:11:03,055 --> 01:11:04,640
[screams]

1550
01:11:04,723 --> 01:11:06,141
[grunting]

1551
01:11:06,767 --> 01:11:08,060
[high-pitched] Mmm.

1552
01:11:09,394 --> 01:11:11,021
What are you doing?

1553
01:11:12,064 --> 01:11:13,524
[Grug] Where you going, Phil?

1554
01:11:13,607 --> 01:11:15,609
[breathing heavily]

1555
01:11:15,692 --> 01:11:18,153
No man cave here.

1556
01:11:18,237 --> 01:11:21,657
- [shrieks]
- You can hide from your family...

1557
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:26,286
[chuckles]
...but you can't hide from me.

1558
01:11:28,163 --> 01:11:31,041
Well, your precious pack...

1559
01:11:31,959 --> 01:11:33,836
is glad you're gone...

1560
01:11:34,962 --> 01:11:36,505
because you smother them.

1561
01:11:37,548 --> 01:11:41,260
Oh!
Well, you built a wall around your family.

1562
01:11:41,343 --> 01:11:43,470
But you also built a wall

1563
01:11:43,554 --> 01:11:46,431
around your heart.

1564
01:11:46,515 --> 01:11:47,683
Oh!

1565
01:11:47,766 --> 01:11:49,476
You know what you are?

1566
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:51,061
I'll tell you what you are.

1567
01:11:51,144 --> 01:11:52,479
- You're...
