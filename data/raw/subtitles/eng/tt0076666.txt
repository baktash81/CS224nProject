1
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,117
Hiya, Tony. Two or three?

2
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:00,661
Two. Two. Give me two. That's good.

3
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,298
Hey, you guys do layaway?

4
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,717
As long as it don't turn into
a 20-year mortgage.

5
00:02:56,802 --> 00:03:00,805
All right, look, put me down for $5
for that blue shirt in the window.

6
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,558
-Hold it for me.
-Hey, wait for your receipt.

7
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:06,435
-I trust you.
-Please don't. Don't trust me.

8
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:58,654
-What did he charge you?
-$7.98.

9
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,406
That bastard.
Wait till he runs out of something.

10
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,074
Listen, you know what to tell her.

11
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,410
Excuse me, ma'am, I gotta get by.

12
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,828
-Got a second?
-Just a minute.

13
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,997
Look what I got for you,
Carnival, gold, just like you wanted.

14
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,166
Where have you been?
I've been here for a half hour.

15
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,335
That's all right. Look, I'm gonna
make you a deal on this paint.

16
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,920
-I'm very angry with you.
-That's all right.

17
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:17,131
Look, I'm gonna make you
a nice deal on this. $1 off for you.

18
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,967
$1 0.98 on this special gold paint.

19
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:21,802
-How you like that?
-Thank you.

20
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,554
-I'll take a gallon of this.
-All right.

21
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,556
You got it. Heads up.

22
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,352
That's all right.

23
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,563
Customers like that,
it gives them a sense of power.

24
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,774
I need some brushes.

25
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,901
All right, how much painting
you planning to do?

26
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:40,446
After these two rooms,
I wouldn't paint my wife's ass purple.

27
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,198
What color is it now?

28
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,033
You wanna know
what color my wife's ass is?

29
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,910
You brung it up.

30
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:50,414
Actually, it ain't got no color,
just stripes, them stretch stripes.

31
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:51,874
What about them brushes?

32
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,378
Right. See that second display counter?
Over there.

33
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:05,680
-Hey, Mr. Fusco, can I get an advance?
-Payday's Monday.

34
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,598
I know payday is Monday,

35
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:09,809
but every place else
is Friday or Saturday.

36
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,477
And they're broke on Monday.

37
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,562
-Boozing, whoring...
-Oh, come off it.

38
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,731
Pissing away their money all weekend.

39
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,776
This way, you're paid on a Monday,
you got money all week.

40
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,446
-You can save a little, build a future.
-Oh, fuck the future.

41
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:28,077
No, Tony, you can't fuck the future,
the future fucks you.

42
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:32,373
It catches up with you, and it fucks you
if you ain't planned for it.

43
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,084
Look, tonight is the future,
and I am planning for it.

44
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,044
There's a shirt I gotta buy,
a beautiful shirt. Blue...

45
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,380
Sorry, Tony, no exceptions.

46
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,301
Just wait till you need an advance,
all right?

47
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:45,720
Big shot.

48
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,432
Hey, come on.

49
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:54,895
Thanks, Tony.

50
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,327
Where you been?

51
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:15,458
Your mother wants to know
where you been.

52
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,253
Where you been?

53
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:22,256
Your father's asking you!
Where you been?

54
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,551
Dinner's gonna be late tonight,
they was out of things at the market.

55
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,636
But you'd have been late
if it was normal.

56
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,431
-Hey, Tony.
-Hey, hot stuff. Give me a kiss.

57
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:34,101
-Look what I made for you. Here.
-Oh, that is beautiful.

58
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:35,352
-You like it?
-Yeah.

59
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:36,479
You'll put it in your room?

60
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:37,605
Yeah, I'll put it in my room right now,
how's that?

61
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:38,731
-Okay.
-All right.

62
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,890
-Dinner's on the table.
-I ain't hungry.

63
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,643
Hey, just because
you're kicking in for food,

64
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,103
don't mean you don't gotta eat.

65
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,729
You still gotta eat.

66
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:03,232
-I got my shirt on, all right?
-So?

67
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,734
So, I don't want to get anything on it,
that's what.

68
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,611
You got nothing to be afraid of.

69
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,030
Your mother's spaghetti sauce
don't drip.

70
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,700
It don't taste and it don't drip.

71
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,119
Let's go.

72
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,047
How come every day
it's the same thing?

73
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,216
I come home,
you tell me I'm late for dinner

74
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:32,845
when you know that I gotta work till 6:00
and I can't make dinner on time.

75
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,555
You should've been a priest,
like your brother,

76
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,099
you wouldn't worry about a job.

77
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,018
Yeah.

78
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,979
Every time you mention Frank, Jr.,
you gotta cross yourself?

79
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:46,025
He's a priest, ain't he?
Father Frank, Jr., your brother.

80
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:49,361
Your mother doesn't have much
to cross herself about these days.

81
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,030
You're so jealous of Frank, Jr.

82
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,282
-Oh, shut up, will you?
-Hey!

83
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,786
-What are you doing?
-Hey, the shirt! Watch the shirt, stupid.

84
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,580
-Basta!
-All right. Come on.

85
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,790
-Mangia, mangia.
-Yeah, go ahead. Eat, eat.

86
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,959
I got more pork chops, more spaghetti.

87
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,420
What do you mean, you got
more pork chops? I'm out of work.

88
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,672
Yeah, well, as long as we got $1 left,
we eat good in this house.

89
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,549
-What?
-Yeah, I might even get a job myself.

90
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,509
Like hell, you will.

91
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:16,764
Twenty-five years in construction work,
I always brought home a paycheck.

92
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,934
What, six, seven months
I'm out of work?

93
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,435
Then, all of a sudden, what?

94
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,938
-You're hitting me and talking back.
-All right, all right.

95
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,189
Talking about getting a job
and hitting me.

96
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,775
All right, all right. No hitting,
no slapping at the dinner table. Okay?

97
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:31,403
That's the rule.
And you was the one that was hitting.

98
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,906
You never hit me before. Never.

99
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,575
Not in front of the kids.

100
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,001
-One pork chop! One!
-Hey, Frank!

101
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,545
It's disgusting, Ma. He's sick.

102
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:51,173
Will you just watch the hair?

103
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:55,052
You know, I work on my hair a long time
and you hit it.

104
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,845
He hits my hair.

105
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:02,351
Take care of his hair.
I'm gonna take a walk.

106
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,858
Tony, you walk me to church later?

107
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,443
Didn't you go already today?

108
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,821
Yeah, confession.
I gotta go back and pray for something.

109
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,239
For what?

110
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,867
I gotta pray
for Father Frank, Jr. to call me.

111
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,286
Why don't you call him direct?

112
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,997
I want him to call me.
A son should call his mother.

113
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:27,543
Wait a minute. You're going to church
to have God make Frank, Jr. call you?

114
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,920
-Right.
-I don't believe it.

115
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,633
You know, you're turning God
into a telephone operator.

116
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,944
Go, go, now!

117
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,989
Hey, you scumbags! Get back here!

118
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,576
-Assholes.
-Come on, fuckhead!

119
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,579
Hey, the stubborn fuck won't budge.

120
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,516
-Will you put two hands on the wheel?
-I got two hands on the wheel!

121
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,810
Hey, you know, you assholes
almost broke my pussy finger.

122
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,480
Oh, yeah, you wouldn't know
which one it was.

123
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:30,647
Hey, get some of this, will you?

124
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:31,982
Hey, Gus, tell them what we got.

125
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,151
Oh, yeah, we got some ups,
we got some downs,

126
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,570
three ludes, two Js,
and a half a bottle of vodka.

127
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,946
All right, yeah, yeah!

128
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:41,450
That's what you got, huh?
I bet I'd get a bigger high from a fart.

129
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,993
-You want something?
-No.

130
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,621
We ain't dropping nothing till I say so.

131
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,790
-Oh, come on. Why the fuck not?
-Hey, bullshit.

132
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,625
I got my reasons, all right?
I got my reasons.

133
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,627
Oh, fuck, Tony.
What's wrong with you, man?

134
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,920
Hey, give me the vodka.

135
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,464
Hey, when're you gonna get new tapes?
These things are four years old.

136
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,383
I bought them in the bargain basement.

137
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,843
You don't like my tapes?
I'll get new tapes.

138
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,503
Hey, looking sharp, huh?

139
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,505
Sharp as you can look
without turning into a nigger.

140
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,424
-Or a spic.
-Spic, spic.

141
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,925
Would you put your dick in a spic?

142
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,094
-Does it get bigger in a nigger?
-I don't know.

143
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,387
I gotta score tonight, man.

144
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,347
I'm horny, you know what I mean?
Horny.

145
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,933
Yeah, man, I know what you mean.
Horny, right? Horny!

146
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,060
Hey, anybody scores,
you get in the car for 10 minutes,

147
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,603
and you're out for the next guy, all right?

148
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,522
If you get five, you get
a medal of honor with rubies,

149
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,690
and a piece of the Pope's ass.

150
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,858
What are you talking about, man?

151
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,443
The Pope don't got no ass,
that's why he's the Pope.

152
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,862
Now, shape up, you assholes.
We're the faces.

153
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,899
Tony, how's it going? All right?

154
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,793
Hey, Moe!

155
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:14,019
Hey, Tony, you seen Pauline
around here at all?

156
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,479
No, we ain't seen Pauline.

157
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,814
Joey, you seen Pauline?

158
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:20,275
Hi. What would you like?

159
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,570
-Oh, give me a Seven and Seven.
-Yeah, I'll take a beer.

160
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:24,947
Hey, I'd like a vodka and tonic.

161
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,783
You guys wanna go see the Knicks
on Tuesday? Anybody?

162
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,327
-Give me a...
-Wanna see the Knicks?

163
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:47,803
Tony.

164
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,723
-Yeah.
-What do you mean, "yeah"?

165
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,308
Well, I mean, I could dance with you,

166
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,812
but, you know, you're not
my dream girl or nothing like that.

167
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:01,149
You want a dream girl?

168
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,944
Well, then go to sleep
and have a nightmare.

169
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,446
Hey, Gus, here's the speed.

170
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:09,241
What are you doing? Here, take this.

171
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,494
Hello, again. This is beautiful Monti,
your delicious deejay,

172
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,705
reminding you about
the Universal Disco sweepstakes,

173
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,291
so get in line to get the prize.

174
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,836
-Oh, looks good!
-Go, baby.

175
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:52,326
A trip. A good trip.
Feel the music, baby.

176
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,295
Look at that chick.
I'm gonna dance with her.

177
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,713
Which one?

178
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,302
Come on, Tony! Dance!

179
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:26,985
All right!

180
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,838
It's so beautiful in there.
I like your new haircuts.

181
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,841
I like that polyester look.
Turn yourself there, baby.

182
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,477
All right!

183
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,562
Yeah!

184
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,777
Hey, Tony, you know something?

185
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,446
You're the king out there.
You're great. You're a great dancer.

186
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,490
You could do as good as me
if you practiced.

187
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,575
Yeah?
Think I'd be a good dancer, Tony?

188
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,911
Sure. Why not? No.

189
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:19,996
-No?
-No.

190
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:23,792
-Ain't you gonna ask me to sit down?
-No, you'd do it.

191
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,212
-But you'd ask me to lay down.
-No, you would not do it.

192
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,549
Double J, move over.
I want you to meet my friend here.

193
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:31,717
Hey.

194
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,260
Hey, Tony, listen,
you want some speed?

195
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:36,221
It's very good stuff, Ton.
Really, it's good stuff. You want some?

196
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,181
Can't you guys get off on dancing?

197
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:41,685
Tony, can I wipe off your forehead?

198
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,604
Why not? Sure. Go ahead.

199
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,694
Hey, Doreen, it ain't no blowjob.

200
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,821
You don't know fuck
about women, Joey.

201
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,906
You get a blowjob easier
than you get that.

202
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,324
I noticed.

203
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,326
I love to watch you dance, Tony.

204
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:02,247
-Oh, yeah?
-I love it. I love to watch you dance.

205
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:06,752
I just love it, watching you dance.

206
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,336
Hey, Tony, listen, do her a favor.

207
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,088
Why don't you take her
for a dance, huh?

208
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,298
That's a good idea. Wanna dance?

209
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:12,841
Would you like to dance with me?
I'd dance with you.

210
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,634
It's for charity.

211
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,013
Any kind of dresses
with the lace on the side.

212
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,390
Weirdest chick I ever seen.

213
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,561
Ton, I love to watch you dance.

214
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,775
I just love it, watching you dance.

215
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,403
Doreen, move up a little bit.
Come on, doll.

216
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:36,114
She's doing a two-step with him.
Jesus Christ.

217
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:39,117
Get your head out of his belt, there, doll.

218
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:40,577
Oh, Jesus.

219
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:44,539
You can't dance to this shit.

220
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,542
-Let's get the fuck out of here.
-I paid $5 to hear this shit?

221
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,462
You paid $5?
I fucking paid for you to get in.

222
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,257
Hey, Monti,
what are you playing that shit for?

223
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:56,051
What are you talking about, baby?

224
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,471
Look at that chick, she's dancing, man.
She's grooving.

225
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:27,833
-Joey?
-Yeah.

226
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,584
You know that girl?

227
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,505
No.

228
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,049
-You ever see her before?
-No.

229
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,428
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I seen her here
about a month ago.

230
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,895
She can dance, you know that?

231
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,232
She got the wrong partner, of course,
but she can dance.

232
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:57,195
-Go ask her.
-Fuck you.

233
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,197
Yeah? Which position?

234
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,834
Who the hell's that guy?

235
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,057
-Hey, Penny.
-Hey, Tony!

236
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,059
-How you doing?
-Okay. How you been?

237
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,853
All right. You gonna dance for me?

238
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,980
-Sure, why not?
-Okay.

239
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,154
-Hello, Lucille.
-Hello, Nureyev. How you doing?

240
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,616
-You got a Seven and Seven for me?
-Sure, doll.

241
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,034
Give me one of your butts, too,
all right?

242
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:45,535
Sure.

243
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,208
Having another sweepstakes.

244
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:53,752
I know that.

245
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:57,130
It's double the prize money. $500.

246
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,803
You gonna enter?

247
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,389
Well, you'll need a partner.

248
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,814
We won before.

249
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:17,859
But we're gonna have to practice.

250
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,029
We'll have to practice.

251
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,490
They got people coming in
from Manhattan.

252
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:26,034
Revelation, Gazebo's.
You know that, right?

253
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,495
We'll have to practice.

254
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:29,955
That's "practice," Annette.

255
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,499
It don't mean dating,
it don't mean socializing,

256
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,417
it means practice.

257
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,463
Why not? We had a date.

258
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,508
Yeah, once, and once was enough.

259
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:43,385
Why?

260
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:47,180
Why? Annette, the whole time,
you talked about your married sister.

261
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,183
And then, you was talking
about your other married sister.

262
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,893
And then, your third married sister.

263
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,812
I got the idea
that all you was interested in

264
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,689
was being a married sister yourself.

265
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,649
I got bored with it.

266
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,777
Hey, look, I told you
I'd take care of it, huh?

267
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:04,030
Hey, Tony, look, Double J's been
in the car 25 minutes with some chick.

268
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:05,198
So what?

269
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,993
So, I can't get the selfish prick out.

270
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:11,454
These guys can't do nothing without me,
you know that?

271
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,221
Hey, listen, are you gonna
make it with Annette?

272
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,181
No, I don't think so.

273
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:32,267
You know, Joey, you make it
with some of these chicks,

274
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,685
and they think
you gotta dance with them.

275
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,228
Look at this guy, huh?

276
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,772
All right, get out.
You've been in there 20 minutes.

277
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:40,608
-Come on!
-25 in the car, 20 in the chick.

278
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,862
Yeah, well, get out
before we pull you out.

279
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:47,032
-She ain't come yet.
-Since when do you care?

280
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,078
Hey, come on!

281
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,456
Whoa. Okay.

282
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,416
-Harder! Harder!
-Okay, it's happening!

283
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,377
It's happening! It's happening!

284
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:01,588
I'll be out in a minute, man.

285
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:04,507
Harder! I'm coming! I'm coming!

286
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:06,593
Oh, yeah!

287
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:10,930
Yes.

288
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:17,812
What did you say your name was?

289
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,461
Kiss me.

290
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,671
Kiss me!

291
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,844
Oh, I just kissed Al Pacino!

292
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,256
Al Pacino. I don't look like Al Pacino.

293
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,301
Well, I could look like him.

294
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:36,761
Al Pacino.

295
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:39,555
Yeah. Al Pacino.

296
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:45,103
Al Pacino!

297
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:47,438
"Attica! Attica!

298
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:49,649
"Attica! Attica!

299
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,401
-"Attica!"
-Hey, give me the ball.

300
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,988
Hey, you wanna go see
that Bruce Lee picture at the Orpheum?

301
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:56,239
-Yeah!
-Hey, you wanna know something?

302
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,283
Bruce Lee's dead,
so I don't give a damn about him.

303
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,868
-Hey, look.
-Man, you got no respect for the dead.

304
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,161
What kind of shit is that, huh?

305
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:04,080
Hey, you guys see what the Knicks
are gonna pay Frazier?

306
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,374
We're never gonna make
that much money in our whole life.

307
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,794
-Hey, douche! Douche!
-It's all right. It's okay.

308
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,171
Hey, you know why
you don't kill fags on Sunday?

309
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,716
You kill fags on Sunday,
they go straight to heaven.

310
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,426
Hey, sweetheart! Hey, your turn, isn't it?

311
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,803
You look so heavenly,
it makes me want to die, you know?

312
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,680
Hey, Double J, hey!

313
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,308
You know, this is a drag.

314
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,643
What's with you today, huh?

315
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:27,854
Nothing.
I'd just rather be doing 2001 tonight.

316
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:29,397
Yeah? Well, fucking do it.

317
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,691
Oh, "fucking do it."
20, 30 bucks, asshole!

318
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,901
You got 20, 30 bucks
to blow twice a week?

319
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,737
-Come on, Tony.
-Hey, Tony.

320
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:38,156
Man, I'm gonna get myself one of these,
you know.

321
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,615
You're never gonna get yourself
one of these.

322
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,783
These things cost too much money.

323
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:41,951
You'll never have that kind of money.

324
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:43,578
Hey, you, you know,
I've had you up to here.

325
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:44,912
That's your favorite speech.

326
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,080
You're never gonna have
that kind of money.

327
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:47,290
Not you, not me, not anybody.

328
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:50,084
Hey, get it together before it's all
over the street, huh? You see this?

329
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,502
This is a Caddy Seville.

330
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:54,130
My Uncle Nunzio's got one of these
and he's got a Mercedes Benz, too.

331
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,340
You know how he got it?

332
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:58,301
He forced his partner to sell out.
He gave him a real screwing.

333
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:01,471
It's a dog-eat-dog world, right?
Everybody's out for what they can get.

334
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:03,181
It's true.

335
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:05,058
They got it all locked up.

336
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:06,601
Ain't nobody gonna give you a chance.

337
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,227
Nobody gives you nothing, Joey.

338
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:10,855
Yeah, you know,
it's every man for himself.

339
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,066
It's a stinking rat race.

340
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:18,738
Hey, that stuff goes on beautiful, Tony.
Best vinyl I ever seen at that price.

341
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,282
See? I told you.
You just listen to me, right?

342
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:24,118
You know, you saved me a bit
of change on the job. You know paint.

343
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:26,371
You ever want a job as a painter,
why don't you let me know, huh?

344
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,206
You make twice as much
as you make here,

345
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,458
but you break your back.
You interested?

346
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,460
-I don't know.
-Don't be interested.

347
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:36,047
You'll make twice as much,
but you'll break your back.

348
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:39,467
-No advances, no nothing. It's payday...
-I gave you a raise.

349
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,719
-You gave me what?
-A raise.

350
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:45,640
-You kidding me?
-No. Come on, look. See how much it is.

351
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,059
You gave me a raise? Thank you.
I can't believe this.

352
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,560
Wait, hold on, you better look first.

353
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,229
I don't gotta look.
It don't make no difference.

354
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:52,897
You gave me a raise.
That's the important thing.

355
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,316
-It's only $2.50.
-So what?

356
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,819
That's $2.50. It ain't much.

357
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:00,405
The important thing is it's a raise.
I think that's really great.

358
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,407
I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna give you $3.50, all right?

359
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:03,908
-You do not have to, Mr. Fusco.
-I'll give you $3.50.

360
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,493
-I like the raise just the way it is.
-I'll give you $1 more.

361
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,829
Shut up, will you? $4.

362
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:10,081
I'll make it an even $4.

363
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,499
Christ, I've never seen anybody

364
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,085
so shit-ass happy over
a crummy $2.50 raise.

365
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:17,672
Wait a minute. $2?
You just said $4.00, didn't you?

366
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,178
What the hell are you doing?

367
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,681
-I just feel like it, all right?
-Girls do that.

368
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,766
I got a raise today.
How do you like that?

369
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:30,935
Yeah?
Why didn't you say so during dinner?

370
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:34,522
We could've used the conversation.
Put them down. Come here.

371
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:37,442
-How much you get?
-It's gonna be $4.00.

372
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,861
It was... It was $2.50, right?

373
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:41,696
But he raised the raise

374
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,282
when he found out
I wasn't so, you know, disappointed.

375
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,867
-$4.00?
-Yeah.

376
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:49,036
Shit. You know what $4.00 buys today?

377
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:51,456
It don't even buy $3.00.

378
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,292
I don't see nobody giving you a raise
down at Unemployment.

379
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:56,878
$4.00. Shit.

380
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,630
I knew you'd piss on it.
Go on, just piss on it, right?

381
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:02,300
A raise says, like, you're good,
you know what I mean?

382
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:04,635
You know how many times somebody
told me I was good in my life?

383
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,888
Two. Two. Twice. Two fucking times,

384
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:09,891
this raise today and dancing,
dancing at the disco.

385
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:12,727
You sure as fuck never did. Asshole.

386
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:17,648
$4.00. Shit.

387
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:39,420
Why ain't you waiting inside?

388
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:41,672
Well, I wanted to watch you
come down the street.

389
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,424
I like the way you walk.

390
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:45,343
Shit.

391
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:49,263
Tony, listen, I've been thinking.

392
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,016
Maybe I'll make it with you.

393
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,269
That's what you call thinking, huh?
Jesus Christ.

394
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,523
You know what? You're too much,
Annette. You know that?

395
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:01,609
I mean, you say we're gonna make it,
that means we're gonna make it, right?

396
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,528
I mean, like,
I got no say in this at all, right?

397
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:05,029
It's time we went out.

398
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,614
You told me you wanted to do it.

399
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,533
You told me
how horny a man gets when he's 19,

400
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:10,451
how much his balls ache
morning, noon and night,

401
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:13,454
six days a week, sometimes seven,
if he don't get it.

402
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,957
How do you remember those things?

403
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,376
Look, Annette, we're gonna be
spending a lot of time together,

404
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,795
you know, rehearsing,
practicing, whatnot.

405
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:24,048
If we was balling,
it would be like we was going together.

406
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,300
And I won't be going with you.

407
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:28,970
Look, I mean, what are you, anyway?
You a nice girl or you a cunt?

408
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,138
I don't know. Both?

409
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:34,058
You can't be both. I mean, that's a thing
a girl's gotta decide early on.

410
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:37,144
You gotta decide whether
you're gonna be a nice girl or a cunt.

411
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,313
-How you doing, Pete?
-Hey, Tony, my man.

412
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,732
-You got a studio free or what?
-Yeah, two is free.

413
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:46,112
-Good. Hey, how you doing?
-Steady at 65%.

414
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:50,575
Pete. He's always busting my onions.

415
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:53,744
I send him a lot of customers, you know.
He gives me free studio time when...

416
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:55,788
What did he mean, 65%?

417
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:59,292
Oh, that... Oh, that means that he...

418
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:03,671
He scores with 65% of the chicks
that come in here.

419
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,512
And one, two, three, two, two, three.

420
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,514
One, two, one, two, three.

421
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,600
One, two, three. Good.
Two, two, three. Good.

422
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,518
One, two, one, two, three.

423
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,103
Good, that's it.

424
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,688
Now do it again.

425
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,617
That's it, good. All right. All right. Again.

426
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:34,452
Tony, it's only dancing. Jesus.

427
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,787
Only dancing? Forget it, Annette.

428
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:39,206
If you're not gonna take this seriously,
I don't wanna dance.

429
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:40,791
-Don't get mad.
-"Don't get mad."

430
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,209
Jesus.

431
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,966
Look, I think we done
enough dancing for today.

432
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:51,636
So, why don't we... Why don't we
dance Wednesday, all right?

433
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,220
Yeah. Sure.

434
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,140
-All right. Here.
-You walking home now?

435
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,727
No. I'm gonna stick around
and talk to Peter a little bit,

436
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:02,730
and, you know,
work on some stuff myself.

437
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:05,149
-I'll see you later, all right?
-Yeah.

438
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,026
You was good today.

439
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:36,430
Hi. How you doing?

440
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:43,562
Hey, you know, you're
a very good dancer, you know that?

441
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,608
I would like to meet you.

442
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:52,279
Look, would you...
Would you mind just going away, okay?

443
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,365
-What?
-Don't be hurt, but I...

444
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,616
Don't be hurt?

445
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:58,285
Yeah, I wanna be by myself now,
you know?

446
00:33:58,412 --> 00:33:59,787
Listen, I seen you at 2001
the other night.

447
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:01,539
Yeah, so? So?

448
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:04,208
Well, I mean, you was looking at me
and I was looking at you, remember?

449
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,877
Well, what is this? I look at a guy
longer than a millionth of a second,

450
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:10,047
already, he gets delusions of grandeur.

451
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:12,550
You know what you are?
I'm gonna tell you what you are.

452
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:15,553
I bet it begins with a "C," Mr. P.

453
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:18,973
Oh, fine. Fine. That's...

454
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:21,934
I know the type. I know the type. Fine.

455
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:33,154
What you doing up so late?

456
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:37,074
What is this? I walk in,
you don't got no criticism of me?

457
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:41,245
-Your brother's upstairs.
-You're kidding.

458
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,247
-Yo, Frankie!
-Tony.

459
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,666
-Hey, how you doing?
-Hiya, kid.

460
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:50,087
-It's good to see you.
-You, too.

461
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:52,506
Yeah. You look good.

462
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:55,509
No, I don't. You do. You look wonderful.

463
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:58,262
-You checking out my trophy?
-Oh, yeah. That's you, huh?

464
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,181
-Yeah.
-"First prize."

465
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,850
Looks just like you.

466
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,435
Hey, what did you say
to them downstairs?

467
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,353
They look crazy,
they look like zombies, like...

468
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,522
Like somebody died or something.

469
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,649
I think they're in shock, Tony.

470
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:14,320
In shock?
Well, how come they're in shock?

471
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:16,697
I'm leaving the church, Tony.

472
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,326
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure.
Leaving the church.

473
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:24,830
-Tell me another one.
-I'm leaving the priesthood.

474
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:28,918
Oh, come on, Frank.
Don't fool around like that.

475
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:30,836
Do you think I'm losing my hair?

476
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,881
It looks awful thin
right over here and here.

477
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:38,260
Are you serious?

478
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,179
Can I borrow some of your clothes
until I buy some?

479
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,723
I don't want to wear the uniform.

480
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:46,310
I'm sorry, Frank. I really am. I'm sorry.

481
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,395
What are you sorry about?

482
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,398
You got fired, huh?

483
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:53,442
I didn't get fired. I quit.

484
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,735
You quit?

485
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,571
Yeah, you can do those things,
you know.

486
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:10,125
What did Mom say?
What did she say about it?

487
00:36:10,252 --> 00:36:14,797
She said, "Dear Lord, what am I
gonna tell Theresa and Marie?"

488
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:18,425
-And Dad? What did he say about it?
-They're ashamed, the both of them.

489
00:36:18,552 --> 00:36:20,553
They're ashamed, right?

490
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:24,265
You ashamed of me, Tony?

491
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:27,268
Yeah, you are.

492
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,897
-They didn't ask why or nothing?
-No.

493
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:35,776
I think they're afraid to.
Like, I might say, "celibacy."

494
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:40,447
But...

495
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,749
You gonna sleep here tonight?
You wanna sleep in my room?

496
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:53,752
-Yeah, I thought I would.
-All right, you can...

497
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:56,255
I'll get your blankets for you.

498
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:18,611
Frank, how come you left? Really?

499
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:25,826
It's not easy to explain, Anthony.
A lot of things.

500
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,330
One day, you look at a crucifix,

501
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,876
and all you see
is a man dying on a cross.

502
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:38,172
But that's only a backdrop
to something else.

503
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:43,385
Mama and Papa,
their dreams of pious glory.

504
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,972
They turn you
into what they wish at a time...

505
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:52,227
You can't defend yourself
against their fantasies.

506
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:56,523
All I ever really had any belief in
was their image of me as a priest.

507
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,025
That's all.

508
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:10,079
Guess we're gonna have to take
your picture down from the mantle.

509
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:16,460
Know what's weird?

510
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,713
Like, I always felt like
I was the shit of the family,

511
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,173
and you was always, like, perfect.

512
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:25,678
Now that I'm the disgrace to the family,
I'm not so perfect anymore.

513
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:29,056
So, maybe you're not shit anymore.

514
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:35,270
Yeah, maybe if you ain't so good,
I ain't so bad, you know?

515
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:37,189
Yeah.

516
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,401
Ha.

517
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,450
-Give me the groceries, motherfucker.
-Hey, come on.

518
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,910
-Hey, don't take my groceries, man.
-I'm hungry.

519
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,412
-I'm hungry, Gus.
-Hey, what are you doing?

520
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:53,914
Hey, come on! Hey, come on!
Hey, don't eat the apple!

521
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,916
-Give me... Give me it back.
-Here.

522
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,168
Jesus.
What's the matter with you anyway?

523
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:00,546
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

524
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,506
My brother, he quit the Church.
You believe that?

525
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,966
-Yeah?
-I feel...

526
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:06,135
I feel wild. I got all this energy.
I can't believe it.

527
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,302
Yeah?

528
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:08,804
Hey, listen, I'll call you later tonight,
all right?

529
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,222
Yeah, we'll do... Hey!

530
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,891
-See you later, Gus.
-I'll see you.

531
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,978
Come on, honey, higher with the arms.

532
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:18,272
Yeah, that's it.

533
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:20,399
Yeah, do it to me!

534
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,653
Pete, she come in?

535
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,905
I told you on the phone,
she comes in on Tuesday.

536
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,825
-I know. So, did she come in or what?
-And what is it today, huh?

537
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:31,744
-It's Tuesday.
-Yeah.

538
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:37,541
Hey, Ton! Watch it, man.
That one's practicing to be a bitch.

539
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,334
Come on, people!

540
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:45,090
Good, yeah. Oh, that's good.
You're doing great. Yeah.

541
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:19,666
Hello, Stephanie Mangano.

542
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:22,086
I'm Tony Manero.

543
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:25,130
We both got the same last initials.
How do you like that?

544
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:27,341
Wow. We get married,
I don't have to change the monogram

545
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:29,343
on my luggage, huh?

546
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,013
Somebody told me
you was practicing to be a bitch.

547
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,348
Is that true?

548
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:43,899
All right, Mr. Manero.
What do you want to ask me?

549
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,026
I would like to take you out to coffee.
Would that be good?

550
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,112
That's it, huh?
You want me to have coffee with you?

551
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:50,072
I think you're a very good dancer.

552
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:53,826
You know that 2001 Odyssey,

553
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,453
they got a dance contest now.

554
00:40:56,538 --> 00:41:00,040
And I think that we could be
a dynamite team together.

555
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,921
-How old are you, huh?
-I'm 20.

556
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:12,136
Well, I'm 19 at the moment,
but I'll be 20 very shortly.

557
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,679
What I think is this.

558
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:15,722
There's a world of difference
between us, you know?

559
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:18,559
Not just chronologically,
but emotionally,

560
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:21,019
culturally, physically, every which way.

561
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:22,813
And this world would get much bigger

562
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,691
and much worse
with every passing week.

563
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:28,110
What kind of shit is that?

564
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:30,779
-Coffee, not sex.
-Just coffee, huh?

565
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,657
See, look, where I work,
the people are very remarkable.

566
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,243
They're not like these here
Bay Ridge people at all.

567
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,370
You mean snobs
instead of slobs, right?

568
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,330
-What?
-Nothing.

569
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:42,499
Hey, you know, Bay Ridge
ain't the worst part of Brooklyn.

570
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:43,667
You know what I'm talking?

571
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,419
I mean, you know,
it ain't like a hellhole or nothing.

572
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:48,297
Yeah, well, it ain't Manhattan.
It isn't Manhattan.

573
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:50,215
You got no idea how it changes,
you know.

574
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,717
Just right over there,
right across the river,

575
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:53,969
everything is different,
completely different.

576
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,554
It's beautiful, just beautiful.

577
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,473
The people are beautiful,
offices are beautiful.

578
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,268
The secretaries, you know,
they all shop at Bonwit Teller.

579
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,477
Oh, yeah?

580
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:04,396
And, like, the lunch hours
are beautiful, too.

581
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,816
Like, you know, they'll give you,
like, two hours for lunch

582
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,610
-to do something that's related.
-Oh, yeah?

583
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:12,529
Like we've seen
Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet.

584
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:16,533
Over here. Romeo and Juliet, yeah?
I read that in high school.

585
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:19,620
That's... That's Shakespeare, right?

586
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:22,706
No, it's Zeffirelli,
the director of the movie.

587
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,876
-You know, the movie? Film.
-Yeah.

588
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,378
You know what?
What I never understood

589
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:30,339
about that Romeo and Juliet,

590
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:33,759
I never understood why Romeo,
he took the poison so quick, you know?

591
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:36,511
I feel like he could have waited
or something.

592
00:42:36,638 --> 00:42:39,640
Well, that's the way
they took the poison in those days.

593
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,894
Hey, you gonna eat?
Here, look at a menu.

594
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,897
No, no. I'll just have tea.
Tea with lemon.

595
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:51,526
I started drinking tea recently, you know.
It's really a lot more refined.

596
00:42:51,653 --> 00:42:53,362
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

597
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:54,947
All those women executives
in my office,

598
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:56,490
they all drink tea with lemon.

599
00:42:56,574 --> 00:43:00,118
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah. And you notice that I do, too.

600
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:03,497
-I like coffee, you know? I drink coffee.
-Yeah.

601
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:10,712
You see, like, I've only been
at this agency a really short time,

602
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:15,467
but already I'm functioning in a, kind of,
public relations capacity, you know.

603
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,178
I fill in for the agents
when they're elsewhere.

604
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:20,722
Like, this week, you know, I had...

605
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,725
I had business lunches
with Eric Clapton at La Cote Basque

606
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,853
-and Cat Stevens at Le Madrigal.
-Oh, far out.

607
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:30,357
Yeah. You heard of
those restaurants, huh?

608
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:34,444
No, I don't know
those exact restaurants.

609
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:35,737
I know the type.

610
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,948
Yeah, but you must have heard
of the artists.

611
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,951
No, I... Not... I don't know... You know.

612
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,452
Not really.

613
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:45,122
So what did you say "far out" for, huh?

614
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:47,708
'Cause it sounded, like, far out.
Wasn't it? I mean...

615
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:50,919
-Well, yeah.
-We'd like a lemon with some tea now.

616
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:54,548
And I'd like a cheeseburger
and some coffee.

617
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:02,597
Hey, you know who came
in the office the other day?

618
00:44:02,724 --> 00:44:04,725
-Who?
-Laurence Olivier.

619
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:05,976
Who's that?

620
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,354
Who's Laurence Olivier?
You don't know who he is?

621
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:10,772
Laurence Olivier, man!

622
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,983
He's the greatest actor
in the whole world.

623
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,152
Oh, come on, you know who he is.

624
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:16,445
He's the English actor,

625
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:19,489
the one on television who does
all those Polaroid commercials.

626
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,867
You know, Laurence Olivier.

627
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:24,703
-Oh, him. Oh, he's good. He is good.
-Yeah.

628
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,496
Well, anyway,
he comes in the office, right?

629
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,165
So, I just do a few errands for him.

630
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,417
So, he goes around,
he tells everybody in the entire office,

631
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,752
he says I'm the brightest,

632
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:35,422
I'm the most vivacious thing
in the entire office he's seen in years.

633
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,965
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

634
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:41,678
Do you think that you could get, like,
a camera from him at a discount?

635
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:44,431
I didn't ask him about a camera.

636
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,641
'Cause you got one already, right,
you sly fox, you.

637
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:48,685
Hey, look, are you enjoying
all this stuff I'm telling you?

638
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:50,145
Sure. I think it's good.

639
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:52,647
Well, I just think maybe you can't handle
hearing about a kind of life

640
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:55,817
that is so completely different
than yours.

641
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:59,279
-You mean "better," don't you?
-Yes, I mean better. Sure, it's better.

642
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:01,114
Can I have some ketchup, please?

643
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:03,033
I mean, I'm out of this scene
almost completely,

644
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,202
you know, this Bay Ridge scene.
I'm moving into Manhattan.

645
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:07,746
I'm getting my own apartment.

646
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,331
I'm changing.

647
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:11,708
I'm really changing as a person,
and I'm growing.

648
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:14,294
You know what I mean? Nobody has
any idea how much I'm growing.

649
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:16,505
Why don't you go on a diet?

650
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:25,097
Okay, listen. I like you.
We could dance together.

651
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:27,682
That's it. We could just dance together
and nothing more.

652
00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:29,935
Nothing personal.
I don't want you coming on to me.

653
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:31,103
Why not?

654
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:33,688
Because I don't date guys
like you anymore, for one thing.

655
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:35,941
You're too young,
you haven't got any class, and, yeah,

656
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:38,568
I'm sick of jerk-off guys
ain't got their shit together!

657
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:41,321
Oh, come on.
It's easy to get your shit together.

658
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:44,825
All you need is a salad bowl
and a potato masher.

659
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,411
Get your shit together.

660
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:50,122
-Would you like to know what I do?
-It's not necessary.

661
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:51,957
I'll tell you what I do.

662
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:55,210
I work in a paint store,
and I got a raise this week.

663
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,087
Right. You work in a paint store, right?

664
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:59,464
You probably live with your family,
you hang out with your buddies,

665
00:45:59,549 --> 00:46:02,467
and on Saturday night you go,
you blow it all off at 2001 , right?

666
00:46:02,552 --> 00:46:05,178
-That's right.
-You're a cliché.

667
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:08,181
You're nowhere,
on your way to no place.

668
00:46:11,853 --> 00:46:14,271
What do you got?
A fucking stairway to the stars or what?

669
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:15,647
-Yeah, maybe.
-Yeah.

670
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,315
I'm taking a course, nights,
at the new school.

671
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,067
Next semester, I'm gonna take two.

672
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,902
Now, you, you probably
didn't get no college, did you?

673
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,195
No, I did not.

674
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,114
Well, did you ever think
about going to college?

675
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,574
-No.
-Not ever?

676
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,451
-No. Did you?
-Well, not back then, no...

677
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:29,494
Then why the fuck
are you bugging me about it for?

678
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:31,663
Well, why not? Why didn't
you ever want to go to college?

679
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:34,249
-Oh, just fuck off, will you? I did not.
-No, really. Tell me. Why not?

680
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:36,543
Oh, Jesus Christ! I didn't!

681
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:44,009
The thing is
the high I get at 2001 is just dancing,

682
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:47,429
it's not being the best
or nothing like that.

683
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:49,973
The only thing is
that I would like to get that high

684
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:53,226
someplace else in my life. You know?

685
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:54,895
Like where?

686
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:58,440
I don't know where.
I don't know. Someplace.

687
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:01,443
You see, dancing, it can't last forever.

688
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:04,070
It's a short-lived kind of thing.

689
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:06,615
But I'm getting older, you know.

690
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,242
You know, I feel like...

691
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:11,244
I feel like, you know,
so what, I'm getting older.

692
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:13,914
Does that mean, like, I can't feel
that way about nothing left in my life?

693
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:15,874
You know? Is that it?

694
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,502
Listen, we gotta split here.

695
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:20,962
No, I'll walk you the rest of the way.

696
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:24,674
No, I'll meet you at the dance studio,
just like we said, okay?

697
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:26,468
Stephanie, I can walk you home.

698
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:29,429
Look, nothing personal, right?

699
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:32,307
Oh, come on, Stephanie. I can walk you.

700
00:47:33,643 --> 00:47:37,270
Oh, Jesus Christ! You know?

701
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:46,488
I don't know where he is.

702
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:48,490
-Did you call him?
-No.

703
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,829
What's the matter? What's going on?

704
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:57,749
It's Gus, man. He's in the hospital.
The spics got him.

705
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,501
-Spanish Barons?
-Barracudas.

706
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:01,962
-Hey, that's my fucking car!
-Forget the car!

707
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:04,005
-Save it for the spics.
-Just give me the keys.

708
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:07,050
-You're asking for it.
-I can't believe it. I just saw him.

709
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,844
He could have run, you know?
But he hung tight. That's Gus.

710
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:12,013
Don't worry about it. Okay? All right?

711
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,807
I got in the hospital to see him.

712
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:17,435
He got a broken nose, busted ribs,
a broken leg and four teeth knocked out.

713
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,603
Shit.

714
00:48:18,688 --> 00:48:21,439
I mean, all he was doing was walking
along the street carrying his groceries,

715
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:23,191
and three of them
do a shove number on him.

716
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,694
They spill his fucking groceries
into the street.

717
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:28,780
So, he says under his breath,
"grease balls, spic dicks,"

718
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,198
and they laid into him.

719
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:44,254
All right. Go check it out.

720
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:04,065
Nobody in there, man.

721
00:49:08,029 --> 00:49:09,696
All right, all right.
This is what we're gonna do.

722
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,905
We're just gonna cruise around

723
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,824
until there's enough of them
that we can handle.

724
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:15,035
Yeah, yeah, we'll just pick
off a couple on the street.

725
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,995
-That's pussy, man!
-Fuck, man. Fuck.

726
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:20,206
-You're fucked up!
-I'm sorry, guys.

727
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:23,293
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

728
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:24,669
You're sorry.

729
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:27,631
Oh, forget it. We'll get them tomorrow.

730
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:34,137
All right, dream good. Jerk off better.

731
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:38,975
Tony, I'm getting married.

732
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:41,227
Will you cut it with that shit?

733
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:44,022
No, listen.
I just wanted to let you know, all right?

734
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,523
All right. Look. If you get married,

735
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:47,359
we'll all go with you
on your honeymoon, all right?

736
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:50,779
-You will? Okay.
-Okay, good. Take it easy.

737
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:53,323
Come on, Bobby. Get in the car.

738
00:49:54,075 --> 00:49:55,450
Hey.

739
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:58,203
Hey, you know,
we should go to the hospital tomorrow.

740
00:49:58,287 --> 00:49:59,954
You know what I'm talking?

741
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:03,541
And you, cool off! You know?

742
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:05,543
All right. Good night.

743
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:31,319
Tony, what did you say
to Father Frank, Jr.?

744
00:50:31,404 --> 00:50:33,655
-What?
-What did you say? What did you do?

745
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,031
Yeah, what did you say?

746
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:39,119
-What are you talking about?
-You must have said something to him.

747
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:40,787
You sleep in the same room.
You talk to him.

748
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,956
The next night he stays out all night,
he don't come back.

749
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,959
-I said nothing to him.
-A priest staying out all night.

750
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,460
A priest is not a priest no more,

751
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:49,713
and he's grown up,
so he can do what he wants.

752
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:51,631
Something you said to him.

753
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:54,175
Oh, yeah? You try and blame me
now he ain't a priest no more?

754
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,969
You been writing to him.

755
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:59,222
I don't believe this.
You're trying to hang this on me?

756
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:03,309
Forget it, all right?
He called. He called. He called.

757
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:06,479
In a couple of days
he's gonna see he's wrong.

758
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:09,482
He's going through, like,
a trial of the soul, you know?

759
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:11,234
He's going back to the church.
He's going back.

760
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,861
No, he won't.
He's not going back to the church.

761
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:14,320
Yes he is.
He's going back to the church!

762
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,156
I'm telling you, he's going back!

763
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,367
You know what?
You don't got a priest no more!

764
00:51:19,452 --> 00:51:20,577
And you got no saint!

765
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:22,746
You got nothing
but three shit children now!

766
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,789
Good. Good.

767
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,126
No.

768
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:36,468
I'm sorry, Mom.

769
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,013
I just...

770
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:44,142
I didn't mean that. I'm sorry.
I'll never say that.

771
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,644
I love you, Mom. I really do.

772
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,439
Go on. Get out of here.

773
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:04,287
-How you doing, Annette?
-Okay.

774
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:05,747
-That's good.
-Yeah.

775
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:10,251
Hey, listen, look, Annette.
I gotta tell you something, all right?

776
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:13,338
It's very hard to tell you this, but...

777
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:16,466
I changed my mind
about us dancing together.

778
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,468
I got another partner.

779
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:24,641
Look, it's professional.
You know what I mean? It's like...

780
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:27,894
Things like this happen
when it's professional.

781
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:31,606
Oh, Jesus Christ.
My fucking mother, now you.

782
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,025
Why do you hate me so much?

783
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,736
All I ever did to you was like you.

784
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:39,239
Give me a break, huh?

785
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:55,672
Hi.

786
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:57,257
You're late.

787
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,926
Five minutes. That's not late.

788
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,469
How long you been here?

789
00:53:01,554 --> 00:53:03,930
I don't know.
Six, seven, something like that.

790
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,391
Pete said you been here 15.

791
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:08,601
Well, who's he?

792
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:12,272
Hey, I got some records over here.
I don't know if you like them or not.

793
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:15,567
-You like these guys?
-Yeah, yeah. Super.

794
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:19,988
Do you do the New York hustle,
the Latin hustle, what?

795
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:22,740
-New York, Latin, I do it all.
-Okay.

796
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,271
Follow me this time.

797
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:05,950
Yeah, that's really nice.
What'd you do, make that up?

798
00:54:06,035 --> 00:54:08,912
Yeah. Yeah. No, I saw it on TV first.

799
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:10,955
Then I made it up.

800
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,124
Hey, you know what? I know this one.
What I do is...

801
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:16,294
Wait a minute. This is simple.
Let me just check something out.

802
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:33,770
-Come on. Come on.
-What you doing?

803
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:42,570
Okay, stay right there.

804
00:54:52,164 --> 00:54:53,665
Now we can dance.

805
00:54:53,749 --> 00:54:55,416
Let me show you the step, okay?

806
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:57,669
The Latin one I was
gonna show you, okay?

807
00:54:57,753 --> 00:55:01,130
Now, take your hand like this,
and count one, two, three.

808
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:05,176
Two, two, three.
Three, two, three, kick, two, three.

809
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:07,720
-Okay, I got that.
-Okay?

810
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:09,555
-Looks good.
-All right.

811
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:18,064
-That's good. I like that.
-Yeah.

812
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,441
-Do you know the tango hustle?
-Yeah, yeah.

813
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:22,443
Okay, let's try that.

814
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:38,644
-Would you like some coffee?
-Yeah.

815
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:41,564
No, no. Look, I really gotta go home.

816
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:46,861
You know something?
I like you when you're like this.

817
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:51,616
When you're quiet and you ain't laying
all that shit on me and everything.

818
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:53,367
Oh, yeah? Well, as a matter of fact,

819
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:55,703
guess who I had lunch with today?
Paul Anka.

820
00:56:55,788 --> 00:56:57,413
I had to open my big mouth, right?

821
00:56:57,498 --> 00:57:00,208
It was very interesting.
Very interesting. Very interesting.

822
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:02,460
Very, very intelligent fellow.

823
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:05,254
You cream over that word,
"interesting," don't you?

824
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:07,840
-Well, what's wrong with "interesting"?
-I don't know, something.

825
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:09,092
You know, I want to tell you something.

826
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:12,220
I've never told you this before,
but I think you're full of shit.

827
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:14,931
-Oh, you do, do you, huh?
-Yeah, except I'm not sure.

828
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:17,725
I'm not sure how much is just shit
and how much is bullshit.

829
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:21,771
Well, listen, when you figure it out,
just let me know, all right?

830
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:26,234
We should really practice
a couple more times.

831
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:28,486
Maybe go to 2001 with a crowd.

832
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,738
How about Saturday?
Would that be good?

833
00:57:30,823 --> 00:57:32,156
Maybe.

834
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:36,327
Stephanie, I wanna
ask you something, all right?

835
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:39,413
I don't know how to say this.

836
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:45,628
Do you think that I am
either interesting or intelligent?

837
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:50,049
Interesting? Yeah. Yeah.

838
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:51,717
Intelligent?

839
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:55,555
I don't know. Maybe.

840
00:57:56,765 --> 00:57:58,516
I don't know. I gotta know you better.
You know what I mean?

841
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,476
You got a way of putting things together,
you know?

842
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:02,228
Seeing things a certain way.

843
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:04,605
Interesting? Yeah, yeah.

844
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:08,651
Intelligent? Yeah, maybe.
Maybe intelligent.

845
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,611
Well, what do you know?

846
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:13,322
All right.

847
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:16,242
Hey, Stephanie,
how come we never talk

848
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,785
about how we feel when we're dancing?

849
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:20,913
-How come we never talk about that?
-Good night and thanks.

850
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:23,249
No, maybe I could walk you
the rest of the way.

851
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,293
-Let me do that.
-Nope.

852
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:31,174
You shouldn't have asked.
You should have just done it.

853
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:33,301
Oh, hot stuff, Jesus.

854
00:59:16,637 --> 00:59:19,055
-Hey, what's happening, Tony?
-Bob, what's up. My brother, Frank.

855
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:20,932
Hey, how you doing? Double J.

856
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,276
Hey, how you doing?

857
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:36,739
-Come on up to the table over there.
-Oh, okay.

858
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:55,883
You guys have the Moses effect.

859
00:59:55,968 --> 00:59:58,928
You arrive
and the crowd parts like the Red Sea.

860
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,680
They know we're the faces, that's all.

861
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:03,975
-How do you like it, Father?
-What father? I look like your father?

862
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:07,561
Please don't call me that.
I never could stand that.

863
01:00:07,646 --> 01:00:10,439
But, yeah, I think the place is,
you know, energizing.

864
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:13,150
-It's all right, huh?
-Great.

865
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:14,402
Good place.

866
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,496
-Tony.
-Hey.

867
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:27,164
Hey.

868
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:30,876
Are you as good in bed
as you are on that dance floor?

869
01:00:33,005 --> 01:00:34,630
Well, are you?

870
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:37,758
Are you as good in bed
as you are on the dance floor?

871
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:41,095
-Hey, he never made it in a bed.
-Watch this.

872
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:44,140
This ain't my regular partner,
but you'll see.

873
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:49,478
Ton, what are you gonna have to drink?
We'll get you something, huh?

874
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:52,148
-Seven and Seven.
-Seven and Seven.

875
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:11,709
So, when's Connie
gonna get her answer, huh?

876
01:01:13,045 --> 01:01:15,296
-You know, Connie.
-Yeah.

877
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,840
If you're as good in bed
as you are on the dance floor,

878
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:20,676
I'll bet you're one lousy fuck.

879
01:01:20,761 --> 01:01:24,180
So, how come they always send me
flowers the next day, huh?

880
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:26,432
You know, some guys don't know
a lousy fuck when they got one.

881
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:29,101
-You know what I mean?
-Oh, yeah?

882
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:31,228
Maybe they thought you was dead.

883
01:01:31,313 --> 01:01:33,814
Father, wanna hear something? Listen.

884
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:36,859
I got a girlfriend of mine, you know.
She's such a good Catholic, Father.

885
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:40,196
She tells me she loves the taste
of communion wafers.

886
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:44,408
Hey, Mr. Manero,
could I talk to you for a sec?

887
01:01:44,493 --> 01:01:45,910
-Hey, what's he doing?
-Frank.

888
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:47,078
Frank, yeah, Frank, yeah. Listen...

889
01:01:49,081 --> 01:01:50,790
Oh, forget this.

890
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:55,169
Look out. Give the kid some room.
He's taking over again.

891
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:56,420
-All right!
-All right!

892
01:01:56,505 --> 01:01:57,713
Go, go!

893
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:03,594
Right on.

894
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:11,394
There he goes.

895
01:02:12,604 --> 01:02:15,022
-Okay, babe.
-There he goes.

896
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,280
Go, Tony!

897
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:49,783
Yeah!

898
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:08,177
Oh, yeah.

899
01:04:12,891 --> 01:04:16,393
-He's very good, yeah.
-He's the king out there, Father.

900
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:19,772
-He's the best.
-Hey, man, he's great. He's great.

901
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,398
You know, man?

902
01:04:27,906 --> 01:04:29,532
Listen, can I talk to you
for a second, Father?

903
01:04:29,616 --> 01:04:31,158
Yes, but call me Frank.

904
01:04:31,243 --> 01:04:34,995
Frank? Frank, listen. Come here.
You wanna hear something? Listen.

905
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,748
I got... My girlfriend, you know...
Can I tell you something?

906
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,250
-Yeah.
-Come here for a sec.

907
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:41,835
Listen, Frank. Wanna hear something?

908
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,922
I got a lot of ideas. You see, like,
I was reading up about the Pope.

909
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:46,715
-Hey, Father?
-Yeah, sure. Frank, Frank.

910
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,676
Frank. Yeah, Frank. Yeah, Frank.

911
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:52,805
Okay, Frank. Listen, Frank,
I got a girlfriend, you know?

912
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,640
She's Pauline.
Her name's Pauline. And...

913
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:57,059
Yeah. What do you mean, you got her...

914
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:58,978
Did you get her pregnant?

915
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:01,522
Yes, I did. Yes. Yes, I did.

916
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:04,483
She loves the taste
of communion wafers.

917
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:07,653
Well, I got a lot of ideas, you know,
swimming around in my head.

918
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,738
And I was reading a lot of stuff lately.

919
01:05:09,823 --> 01:05:13,826
I heard, like, the Pope, he gives special,

920
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,786
-you know...
-Dispensation.

921
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:20,124
Yeah. Do you think the Pope
could give Pauline an abortion?

922
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:22,668
You mean give you
a dispensation for an abortion?

923
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:25,337
Yeah, you think you could do this?

924
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,798
I don't think so, Bobby.

925
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:30,217
Well, maybe, you know,
maybe you could do it for me.

926
01:05:30,302 --> 01:05:33,387
-Maybe?
-I'm sorry, Bobby. I don't think so.

927
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:34,722
I was just thinking.

928
01:05:34,806 --> 01:05:36,765
Have you talked to your priest about it?

929
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:39,727
Yeah, I talk to everybody about it.

930
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:42,187
I talked to a lot of people.
A lot of people. A lot of people.

931
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:44,857
All right, thank you.
Thanks a lot. All right?

932
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,985
You play, you pay. It's funny, huh?

933
01:05:50,322 --> 01:05:54,033
Don't forget, everybody.
You could win, too, man.

934
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:56,952
Disco Universe sweepstakes,
just a week away.

935
01:05:57,037 --> 01:05:58,871
500 bucks. 500 big ones.

936
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:01,373
-Do you know Stephanie Mangano?
-No.

937
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:03,292
-No?
-I know Stephanie.

938
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:05,961
-Did she come in yet?
-No, she didn't get in yet.

939
01:06:06,046 --> 01:06:07,838
-You sure?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

940
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,469
Right, right. Don't forget again, baby,

941
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:15,888
Universal Disco sweepstakes,
just a week away.

942
01:06:16,014 --> 01:06:17,806
Tony! Tony, that was really great.

943
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:19,141
-Oh, you liked it?
-Yeah.

944
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:20,559
Listen, I'm gonna go home now.
All right?

945
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:22,227
-You're gonna go home?
-Yeah.

946
01:06:22,354 --> 01:06:25,648
No, no, stay a little longer, Frank.
The night's just beginning.

947
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:28,400
Yeah, I know,
but it's not my scene, you know?

948
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:30,903
Come on. You didn't expect me
to stay the whole night, did you?

949
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:32,655
No, no. I didn't...

950
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:36,241
Yes, I thought maybe
you'd stay a little longer.

951
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:39,078
-No, it's not your scene. Of course not.
-I'm sorry, Tony.

952
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:41,163
Don't worry about it.
It's nothing, you know.

953
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:42,998
So what, right? Come on.

954
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:45,167
I'll walk you to the door.

955
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:49,254
Hey, you know,
your dancing is really marvelous.

956
01:06:49,381 --> 01:06:52,257
It's exciting. I mean, it's exciting
to watch you out there.

957
01:06:52,384 --> 01:06:55,010
They can't keep their eyes off of you.

958
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:56,845
Look, I got to go now, okay?
I'll see you later.

959
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:59,098
All right, well, have a good night.
I'll see you later. All right?

960
01:06:59,224 --> 01:07:00,432
Yeah, you, too.

961
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:02,267
Hey, she come in or what?

962
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:05,604
Hey, you just asked me,
and I told you she isn't here.

963
01:07:13,405 --> 01:07:16,198
-Tony, your brother, is he okay?
-He's fine.

964
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:19,284
He just had a stomach thing.
I don't know.

965
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:31,255
Just the two of them.

966
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:38,220
-We could make it now.
-What?

967
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:40,556
We ain't practicing,
seeing each other like you said,

968
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:41,807
so we could make it.

969
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:44,393
Look, Annette, we make it
when I decide, all right?

970
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:45,561
No other time.

971
01:07:45,645 --> 01:07:47,146
-All right.
-When I say so, all right?

972
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:49,398
I'll just make it with somebody else.

973
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:51,400
Who? Who?

974
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:53,736
Somebody. I don't care. Anybody here.

975
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:56,071
-Oh, somebody here?
-Yeah.

976
01:07:56,156 --> 01:07:58,407
Double J, Joey.

977
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:00,576
Oh, the fuck you will.
Hey, look. Hey, Bobby.

978
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,327
Look, we're gonna go out to the car,

979
01:08:02,454 --> 01:08:05,789
and when I get back,
we'll go to the bridge, all right?

980
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:10,794
You fixed?

981
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:13,255
Huh?

982
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:15,591
-You fixed?
-What do you mean?

983
01:08:16,676 --> 01:08:19,678
-You know, are you on the pill or what?
-No.

984
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:21,513
No?

985
01:08:22,849 --> 01:08:25,601
What do you got, the IOU, that thing?

986
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:27,811
-Huh?
-No.

987
01:08:28,855 --> 01:08:30,355
No diaphragm?

988
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:32,524
-Nothing?
-It doesn't matter, though.

989
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:35,110
-You don't got nothing?
-It doesn't matter. Tony, I love you.

990
01:08:35,195 --> 01:08:36,612
Are you kidding me?

991
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:38,781
Oh, forget it. Oh, fuck.

992
01:08:38,865 --> 01:08:41,617
Just give me a blowjob.
Ready? Come on.

993
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:47,498
-Just a minute.
-Hey, Tony!

994
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:50,584
Forget it. Forget it. Just fix yourself up.

995
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:52,836
Everything was cool.
Everything was all right.

996
01:08:52,921 --> 01:08:54,755
You had a good time.

997
01:09:07,227 --> 01:09:09,102
Annette, cigarette?

998
01:09:12,023 --> 01:09:13,607
Guess not, huh?

999
01:09:52,063 --> 01:09:53,647
Stupid goofs.

1000
01:10:07,954 --> 01:10:11,790
Hey, Annette, can you dig it?
I knew that you could.

1001
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:23,468
-Joey!
-You're fucked, Double J.

1002
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:25,637
-Hey, Tony.
-What?

1003
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:28,056
Come on.
Let's get this selfish motherfucker.

1004
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:29,808
-All right.
-Let's push him off.

1005
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:32,644
-All right.
-You're going in, you big, fucking hump!

1006
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:38,650
Come on, Ton. Let's get him.

1007
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:43,155
Come on. Let's go. Shit.

1008
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:47,034
Hey, come on, let's get the fucking
show off and throw him the fuck off.

1009
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,535
Hey, Tarzan!

1010
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:57,377
Look out, Double J!

1011
01:10:59,297 --> 01:11:01,548
Don't worry about nothing! I'm coming!

1012
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:08,180
You fuckers!

1013
01:11:08,306 --> 01:11:11,850
-Can you dig it? I knew that you could.
-I knew that you could.

1014
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:16,563
You stupid bitch.

1015
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:30,577
I wish you was staying longer,
you know, Frank?

1016
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:33,163
Ex-priests don't stay back home.

1017
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:35,958
Listen, everyone's too shocked
and disgraced.

1018
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:37,209
A family raises a priest,

1019
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:38,710
they think
they've scored points in heaven,

1020
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:41,046
-and now they're gonna lose them.
-Hey, Frank. How you doing?

1021
01:11:41,172 --> 01:11:44,716
Okay. We better get a move on.
I gotta pick some people on the way.

1022
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:47,886
Okay. Listen, we gotta keep in touch.

1023
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:49,638
Yeah. You gonna like
this settlement house?

1024
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:50,889
What do you think?

1025
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:53,308
-It'll do until I figure out my next move.
-Yeah.

1026
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:55,477
-What about you?
-What about me?

1027
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:57,479
Are you gonna do something
with your dancing, Tony?

1028
01:11:57,563 --> 01:11:59,481
I don't know.
People ask me all the time.

1029
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:02,901
But I don't know, I mean, you know,
I feel like my whole life, right,

1030
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:05,904
I've been told I'm the no-good
in the family and that...

1031
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:11,076
Tony, the only way you're gonna survive
is to do what you think is right,

1032
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:14,246
not what they keep trying
to jam you into.

1033
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:18,125
You let them do that and you're
gonna end up nothing but miserable.

1034
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:19,543
Huh?

1035
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:26,508
-Hey, have a good trip, all right?
-Yeah.

1036
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:30,095
I left you something in your room.

1037
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:32,431
-What did you leave me?
-A souvenir.

1038
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:34,933
Money?

1039
01:12:36,436 --> 01:12:38,103
Leave me money.

1040
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:20,562
So, what are you standing there for?

1041
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:22,647
How come you wasn't there
Saturday night?

1042
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:25,150
I didn't say I was gonna be there
Saturday night.

1043
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:28,820
-The fuck you didn't.
-I said maybe. Maybe's a maybe.

1044
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:30,989
I didn't think you'd go
and get upset about it.

1045
01:13:31,074 --> 01:13:34,409
Oh, forget upset. I'm not upset.
It's just that we needed the practice.

1046
01:13:34,494 --> 01:13:35,994
I mean, you know,
you should've been there.

1047
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,914
All right, right, let's practice then.

1048
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:42,084
We can't.

1049
01:13:42,168 --> 01:13:44,920
I didn't bring the records 'cause
I didn't think you was gonna be here.

1050
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:47,672
Yeah? So what did you come for, huh?

1051
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:55,514
-Stugats. You know "stugats"?
-Yeah, I know "stugats".

1052
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:57,099
All right, we'll use some of this stuff.

1053
01:13:57,183 --> 01:14:00,185
"If you're not of a mind to break up..."

1054
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:02,771
What's up?

1055
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:04,689
We've been waiting, man.

1056
01:14:04,816 --> 01:14:06,608
Pete said you was practicing, you know.

1057
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:09,528
Hey, Tony, we were cruising
you know who. Looking good.

1058
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:12,364
Not now. Don't talk about it now.
Talk about it later.

1059
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:16,034
Stephanie, this is Joey,
this is Double J, this is Bobby C.

1060
01:14:16,119 --> 01:14:18,286
-How you doing, Stephanie?
-How do you do?

1061
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:20,122
-You a dancer?
-Yeah.

1062
01:14:20,206 --> 01:14:22,124
-You hungry?
-Yeah.

1063
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:24,042
What do you wanna eat, huh?

1064
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:28,880
-I'm gonna change and then...
-All right.

1065
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:32,884
What maracas. She's got maracas.
She's got nice tits.

1066
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:36,555
It's like,
I'm gonna be traveling, you know.

1067
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:38,890
Promotional tours
with authors and performers.

1068
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:41,143
Of course, I'm gonna hate
to leave Manhattan, even briefly.

1069
01:14:41,227 --> 01:14:44,312
There's certain ballets and concerts
I'm just gonna have to miss.

1070
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:46,231
Tell them about the people
who come into the office.

1071
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:47,816
That's what they wanna hear.
Tell them that.

1072
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:50,902
Oh, you know who came in today?
This guy, David Bowie.

1073
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:53,738
-He comes in, has this Astrakhan coat...
-He's a fagot.

1074
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:57,492
-He's a half-fagot, man.
-Hey, relax! Come on. Sit down.

1075
01:14:57,577 --> 01:14:59,411
You mean, he's a bisexual.

1076
01:14:59,537 --> 01:15:02,664
Yeah, he swings both ways.
Men and boys.

1077
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:04,666
-What's so funny?
-Oh yeah?

1078
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:08,170
Well, you know who came in today?
Joe Namath. You know Joe Namath?

1079
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:10,172
He comes in
and he wants some coffee,

1080
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:11,339
so I brought him coffee.

1081
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:13,592
And then he asked me to sit down,
have some coffee with him.

1082
01:15:13,718 --> 01:15:14,843
You had coffee with Joe Namath?

1083
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:17,179
Yeah, that's right.
We were talking a little bit.

1084
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:20,098
He wanted to know
what it was like to be 21 .

1085
01:15:20,224 --> 01:15:22,601
I told him I didn't know
'cause I was just 20.

1086
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:25,270
-Yeah, what else?
-That's all.

1087
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:26,438
Ain't that enough?

1088
01:15:26,564 --> 01:15:28,773
Hey, don't you never chew, Tony?
Don't you never chew?

1089
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:31,443
Hey, look, when my mother dies,
I'll give you the job, all right?

1090
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:32,944
You know what's going
down your throat, man?

1091
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:34,362
Big chunks of hamburger, you know.

1092
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:37,365
Big gobs, like dog food,
dog friskies, dog yummies.

1093
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:40,535
You know something, Joey?
He's gonna turn into a dog.

1094
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:58,136
Stephanie, listen,
can I talk to you for a second?

1095
01:15:58,221 --> 01:15:59,804
I was listening
to what you said in there before,

1096
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:04,643
and you seem to know a lot of people,
and a lot of places and a lot of things.

1097
01:16:04,727 --> 01:16:06,228
I got a friend of mine, you know,

1098
01:16:06,312 --> 01:16:09,898
he's a very good friend of mine
and he got a girl pregnant.

1099
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:12,234
He got a girl pregnant,
and I wanted to know

1100
01:16:12,318 --> 01:16:14,152
if you had to make a choice

1101
01:16:14,237 --> 01:16:16,738
between getting an abortion
and have to get married to somebody,

1102
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:18,323
what would you do?

1103
01:16:18,449 --> 01:16:20,659
Well, who would I have to marry?

1104
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:25,080
You'd have to marry me.
You'd have to marry me. Yeah.

1105
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:27,666
I think I'd get an abortion.
Hey, so long, Tony.

1106
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:29,960
It's very nice meeting you.

1107
01:16:30,753 --> 01:16:32,087
So, what'd you guys think of her?

1108
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:35,090
Hey, Tony, I liked her.
I thought she was nice. I liked her a lot.

1109
01:16:35,174 --> 01:16:37,342
She's a snotty bitch, man.

1110
01:16:37,969 --> 01:16:40,428
She's cool.
You just gotta get to know her, that's all.

1111
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:42,514
Hey, Ton, did you fuck her, yet?

1112
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,516
-What do you think?
-I don't think so.

1113
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,352
You know, you guys got a lot
of growing up to do, you know that?

1114
01:16:47,478 --> 01:16:49,980
A lot of growing up. You're babies.

1115
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:52,023
Yeah.

1116
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:55,860
Hey, Mr. Fusco, look,
I need the afternoon off.

1117
01:16:55,945 --> 01:16:58,780
Sam's out. Harold's sick.
Here, take these.

1118
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:01,700
-But I gotta, Mr. Fusco.
-Sorry, Tony.

1119
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:03,952
Look, all I'm asking for
is one afternoon off.

1120
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:06,288
I've been here almost eight months.
I didn't miss a day yet!

1121
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:09,374
-Not today, Tony.
-Oh, come on, Mr. Fusco.

1122
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,876
Some of those old farts,
they miss three, four days at a time,

1123
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:13,128
you don't say nothing to them.

1124
01:17:13,212 --> 01:17:14,796
Hey, cool off.

1125
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,382
Look, I got to have the afternoon off.
I'm taking it.

1126
01:17:17,508 --> 01:17:19,801
-You do, you're fired.
-I'm doing it.

1127
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:23,221
-Then you're fired!
-Then fuck you, asshole!

1128
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:26,224
And the fuck horse you rode in on.

1129
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:27,976
-Fucking cocksucker asshole!
-Tony.

1130
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:31,062
Tony, I don't wanna marry Pauline.
I don't give a fuck about this cunt.

1131
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:34,065
-So, don't marry her!
-Tony, I gotta marry her!

1132
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:35,734
Fuck it. She won't get the abortion.

1133
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:38,570
-Everyone says I gotta marry her, Tony.
-Who says that?

1134
01:17:38,696 --> 01:17:41,072
Oh, fuck, her fucking parents,
my fucking parents.

1135
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:43,158
The fucking priest on the corner.

1136
01:17:43,242 --> 01:17:45,994
Her fucking high school
guidance counselor.

1137
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:48,496
Tony, I'm paralyzed.
I got no more control.

1138
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:50,999
I mean, you and me, Tony,
we've been friends for so long.

1139
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:53,084
I mean, I'm hurting.

1140
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:57,172
Shit! You're always together.

1141
01:17:57,256 --> 01:18:00,091
And I'm always fucking up,
and you're always all right. You know?

1142
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:03,678
I... Oh, come on.
Everybody fucks up. Really.

1143
01:18:03,763 --> 01:18:06,431
-Don't worry about nothing.
-You know, you're great.

1144
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:08,850
I'm in a terrible rush.
I hate to leave you like this.

1145
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:10,685
You got no idea
how much I appreciate this.

1146
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:12,687
I mean, this car's very important
for me today, you know?

1147
01:18:12,772 --> 01:18:14,522
-Will you call me tonight?
-Yeah, I'll call you.

1148
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:16,608
Don't worry about nothing, all right?
Take care.

1149
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:19,361
-I'll talk to you later then?
-Yeah.

1150
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:21,613
-Call me tonight, right?
-Yeah.

1151
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:23,948
You're gonna call me tonight?

1152
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:00,485
You know, Stephanie, this got me fired.

1153
01:19:00,611 --> 01:19:02,404
-What?
-This got me fired.

1154
01:19:02,488 --> 01:19:06,408
You know, you couldn't do it on Sunday,
so, my boss, he fired me.

1155
01:19:06,492 --> 01:19:08,493
Well, I just wanted
to get everything in, you know,

1156
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,412
so I could start fixing up
when I move in on Saturday.

1157
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:11,663
Yeah.

1158
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:14,749
Nobody bitched at my office.
I got the whole day off.

1159
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:18,336
Hey, I'm sorry.

1160
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:21,756
Oh, it's all right. No problem.
No big deal. I can handle it.

1161
01:20:23,903 --> 01:20:26,321
Yeah, come on in.

1162
01:20:26,405 --> 01:20:29,073
Now, put that over here.

1163
01:20:29,867 --> 01:20:31,034
Hey!

1164
01:20:31,911 --> 01:20:33,578
I thought you were
gonna be out of town.

1165
01:20:33,704 --> 01:20:35,580
I postponed the trip.

1166
01:20:39,084 --> 01:20:41,836
Jay, this is Tony Manero. He's a friend.

1167
01:20:41,921 --> 01:20:45,173
-Tony, this is Jay Langhart.
-Unspecified status.

1168
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:47,175
How do you do?

1169
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:49,844
Well, I've decided to leave you
all the furniture.

1170
01:20:49,929 --> 01:20:52,013
What, are you kidding?
You're not gonna take any of this stuff?

1171
01:20:52,097 --> 01:20:54,849
No, I'm gonna start fresh. What the hell,
you picked out most of it anyway.

1172
01:20:54,934 --> 01:20:57,519
-Well, super.
-Stephanie, I told you not to say "super."

1173
01:20:57,603 --> 01:21:00,355
Nobody says "super" anymore.

1174
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:03,691
Can I get you a beer? Glass of wine?

1175
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:06,194
No, man, it's all right.

1176
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:08,613
Hey, I read that book you told me to.
You know, the...

1177
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:10,532
Kerr or the Lawson?

1178
01:21:10,616 --> 01:21:13,618
-The Kerr.
-Should have read the Lawson.

1179
01:21:14,954 --> 01:21:19,290
Listen, if I can help you guys move in,
you just say the word. Be glad to help.

1180
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:30,093
I'll get the rest of the stuff.

1181
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:43,648
Stephanie, who is that guy?

1182
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:47,652
He's an arranger, a record producer.
He wants to do films.

1183
01:21:47,778 --> 01:21:50,488
He's gonna move now
to a more expensive apartment.

1184
01:21:50,614 --> 01:21:52,574
I met him at the agency.

1185
01:21:52,658 --> 01:21:54,826
He didn't want his wife
to know how much money he had

1186
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:57,161
until the divorce was final.

1187
01:21:58,330 --> 01:21:59,497
Come on. Let's go.

1188
01:21:59,582 --> 01:22:03,459
I mean, who is he to you, Stephanie?
That's what I'm talking about.

1189
01:22:04,628 --> 01:22:07,505
He's a friend of mine, okay?
He's a friend.

1190
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:11,509
And I was living with him
for a little while.

1191
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:14,012
Are you in love with this man or what?
I mean, tell me the story.

1192
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:17,265
-That's all I'm asking, is the story.
-No, I'm not. We had a thing.

1193
01:22:17,349 --> 01:22:19,601
You know?
It didn't work out, and it's over now,

1194
01:22:19,685 --> 01:22:21,769
and he's my friend, and he still likes me.

1195
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:23,521
He likes you. He likes you to have...

1196
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:25,940
To have you around for a quick piece
when he feels like it.

1197
01:22:26,025 --> 01:22:28,610
He helped me, man. You don't know
what it's like at that place.

1198
01:22:28,694 --> 01:22:31,112
It's crazy. You don't know shit!

1199
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:35,116
You know? I didn't know how to do stuff,
so I'd go to him and I would ask him,

1200
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,285
and he would tell me how to do things.

1201
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:39,704
And then I'd go back to work
and everything would be all right.

1202
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:41,623
Otherwise, I'd be walking around
like an idiot,

1203
01:22:41,707 --> 01:22:43,875
going, "I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know."

1204
01:22:44,001 --> 01:22:45,960
-And he helps me. He does.
-Yeah, he helps you. Helps you what?

1205
01:22:46,045 --> 01:22:48,546
Get in and out of the sack?
Is that what he helps you do?

1206
01:22:48,631 --> 01:22:50,131
-He helped me.
-Sure.

1207
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:52,550
What the hell do you
expect me to do, man?

1208
01:22:52,635 --> 01:22:55,637
What do you expect me to do?
He helped me.

1209
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:07,899
Don't cry about it. I mean, you know.

1210
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:11,027
All right, so he helped you.
That's good for you.

1211
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:17,575
All right. Come on. Let's get out of here.

1212
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:19,911
I'm sorry.

1213
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:23,498
It's all right. Don't worry about nothing.

1214
01:23:23,582 --> 01:23:26,668
Don't worry about that.
Don't worry about nothing.

1215
01:23:26,752 --> 01:23:28,544
Stephanie, don't.

1216
01:23:30,047 --> 01:23:32,423
Look, we'll stop here for a while.
We'll sit down. All right?

1217
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:34,759
Don't stop. Just take me home.
Just take me home, man.

1218
01:23:34,885 --> 01:23:36,594
No, come on, we'll sit here
for a while, all right?

1219
01:23:36,679 --> 01:23:39,097
Just, don't worry about nothing.

1220
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:47,355
It's pretty, isn't it?

1221
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:55,947
Sit down.

1222
01:24:08,085 --> 01:24:10,294
You know how tall that bridge is?

1223
01:24:10,379 --> 01:24:13,881
That bridge, that tower right there,
goes up 690 feet.

1224
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:17,969
They got 40 million cars
going across there a year.

1225
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:22,640
127,000 tons of steel is involved in that.

1226
01:24:23,642 --> 01:24:24,892
The concrete there,

1227
01:24:24,977 --> 01:24:28,980
they got almost three-quarter
of a million yards of concrete.

1228
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:30,148
That's right.

1229
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:34,902
The center span, right there,
is 4,260 feet long.

1230
01:24:34,987 --> 01:24:37,739
And with the on-ramps,
it all together totals, like,

1231
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:40,241
something like 2.5 miles.

1232
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:44,078
You know all about the bridge,
don't you?

1233
01:24:44,163 --> 01:24:45,997
That's right.

1234
01:24:46,123 --> 01:24:48,499
I know everything about that bridge.

1235
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:52,628
You know what else?
They got a guy buried in the cement.

1236
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:54,839
Yeah?

1237
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:57,925
Know how it happened?

1238
01:24:58,010 --> 01:25:00,428
Well, they was working on it,
apparently, at the time.

1239
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:03,681
And they, I guess,
they were pouring the cement,

1240
01:25:03,766 --> 01:25:05,266
and he slipped off, you know,

1241
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:09,353
on the upper part of the bridge
and, you know, fell in.

1242
01:25:12,191 --> 01:25:13,691
Dumb fuck.

1243
01:25:14,151 --> 01:25:16,360
-What a way to go.
-I come down here a lot.

1244
01:25:16,445 --> 01:25:18,446
You know, I get ideas.

1245
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:21,157
Oh, yeah? What kind of ideas you get?

1246
01:25:21,825 --> 01:25:25,286
I don't know, daydreams, you know?
I daydream a lot.

1247
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:53,147
Mr. Fusco, I come for what I got coming.

1248
01:25:53,232 --> 01:25:54,482
Tony. Come on.

1249
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:57,151
Things got a little hot under the collar,
don't you think?

1250
01:25:57,236 --> 01:25:58,486
What are you talking about?

1251
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:00,905
I don't want to lose you, Tony.
You're a good kid.

1252
01:26:01,031 --> 01:26:04,408
Customers like you.
I want you to stay on.

1253
01:26:04,535 --> 01:26:08,079
-You mean, I ain't fired?
-No. Come on. Here.

1254
01:26:08,205 --> 01:26:11,415
-Jesus Christ. I don't believe this.
-You got a future here, Tony.

1255
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:14,502
Here, Harold's with me 18 years,
since I opened.

1256
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:16,712
Mike, 15 years, huh?

1257
01:26:17,256 --> 01:26:20,716
Come on, now. Give Harold
a hand, huh? He's making a mess.

1258
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:39,944
Pete, what are you doing?

1259
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:43,197
Trying to get up to 70%?

1260
01:26:43,282 --> 01:26:46,951
Whoa, man.
I didn't know you hung your label on her.

1261
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:49,704
What are you doing?

1262
01:26:49,788 --> 01:26:52,123
That guy's the biggest cunt hound
in Bay Ridge.

1263
01:26:52,249 --> 01:26:54,125
Oh, my God.
I've been in serious danger.

1264
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:58,087
It's no fucking joke, Stephanie.
That guy's a fucking sleazy whore.

1265
01:26:59,965 --> 01:27:03,134
I was dancing with the fella.
You know? Dancing.

1266
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:06,387
-No, no. No, forget it.
-Come on. Let's dance, huh?

1267
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:08,723
You disgust me, you know that?

1268
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:10,016
-Well, what do you mean?
-Forget it.

1269
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:12,602
-Forget it.
-Tony, I was just dancing with the guy.

1270
01:27:17,608 --> 01:27:18,983
Tony! Tony!

1271
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:22,111
-Annette, what do you want?
-Just look. Look.

1272
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:28,618
Oh, Jesus.

1273
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:19,460
Beautiful, man. They got six or seven
of them in there and a couple of chicks.

1274
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:22,296
Listen, why don't we wait till they get
down to about three, four people?

1275
01:28:22,381 --> 01:28:23,714
-Yeah, one or two?
-Tony!

1276
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,884
-All right. I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
-Tony, listen, you gotta help...

1277
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:29,553
-Shut up! Shut up!
-Back up, all right?

1278
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:32,139
What are you doing?
What are you doing, Double J?

1279
01:28:32,224 --> 01:28:35,059
-Trying to back it up!
-What are you, crazy?

1280
01:28:36,019 --> 01:28:38,896
-Tony, I'm gonna get married.
-Shut up!

1281
01:28:40,691 --> 01:28:42,692
Come on, fuckers!

1282
01:28:57,749 --> 01:28:59,250
Tony!

1283
01:29:07,551 --> 01:29:11,262
Tony! Tony, help me! Please, God!

1284
01:29:19,021 --> 01:29:21,772
Hey, what the hell
you think you're doing, huh?

1285
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:49,592
Ton!

1286
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:56,807
Ton! Come here, it's me! Come on!

1287
01:29:56,933 --> 01:29:59,393
-Let's get out of here.
-You okay?

1288
01:30:03,273 --> 01:30:04,565
Jesus!

1289
01:30:07,486 --> 01:30:09,779
He chickened, man! Where is he?

1290
01:30:17,996 --> 01:30:19,663
Go, man! Go!

1291
01:30:23,585 --> 01:30:27,004
-Where the hell were you, huh?
-Tony, I was just driving around.

1292
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:30,800
-Oh, Jesus Christ!
-I was looking for you. Where were you?

1293
01:30:39,309 --> 01:30:41,519
Hey, Gus. Did you get the number
of the truck that hit you?

1294
01:30:41,645 --> 01:30:43,604
Don't make me laugh, all right?
Do not make me laugh.

1295
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:45,689
-Look at this. We don't love you, right?
-Right.

1296
01:30:45,774 --> 01:30:47,274
-We got them.
-Does that hurt?

1297
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:48,859
Yeah, really, huh?

1298
01:30:48,944 --> 01:30:51,612
Hey, you guys really, you know,
you really kicked their asses?

1299
01:30:51,696 --> 01:30:54,031
Hey, come on, we got them
where they breathe, Italian style.

1300
01:30:54,157 --> 01:30:55,449
Yeah, that's great, you know.

1301
01:30:55,534 --> 01:30:58,786
Only, you know,
I ain't so sure it was the Barracudas.

1302
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:01,038
Dr. Allison to Emergency.

1303
01:31:07,129 --> 01:31:09,547
Hey, what are you talking about?
You said it was.

1304
01:31:09,631 --> 01:31:11,549
No, I said it probably was.

1305
01:31:11,675 --> 01:31:12,967
Don't be pulling our legs now.

1306
01:31:13,051 --> 01:31:15,970
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1307
01:31:16,054 --> 01:31:18,139
-You said it probably was.
-Yeah, I said probably.

1308
01:31:18,223 --> 01:31:20,474
-That's what you told us.
-I said probably 'cause I wasn't sure.

1309
01:31:20,559 --> 01:31:22,643
You know? I mean,
it could've been a Spanish...

1310
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:24,562
Stupid, fucking bastard.

1311
01:31:24,688 --> 01:31:29,066
-We almost got our heads busted.
-Yeah, not you, lover.

1312
01:31:39,578 --> 01:31:42,163
You know, you got some fucking pair
of balls on you, you know that, Gus?

1313
01:31:42,247 --> 01:31:43,330
-Hey, hey, come on.
-You know that?

1314
01:31:43,415 --> 01:31:46,417
Hey, you know, I had to say something.
Right? I had to lay somebody out for it.

1315
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:48,586
What are you, stupid?
You can't see who hurt you, right?

1316
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:49,837
Oh, my God, what are you doing?

1317
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:52,173
If I said I didn't know who it was,
they would have got off. Come on.

1318
01:31:52,257 --> 01:31:53,924
Yeah, well, fuck you, Gus.
You know what I feel like doing?

1319
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:56,594
I feel like breaking your broken leg.
That's what I feel like doing.

1320
01:31:56,678 --> 01:31:57,928
-Hey, come on.
-Let's get out of here.

1321
01:31:58,013 --> 01:32:00,598
Oh, God, I can't believe
this whole fucking thing.

1322
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:03,684
You wanna know something?
I could have killed him.

1323
01:32:03,768 --> 01:32:07,021
-You couldn't kill a fucking crab lice.
-Oh, shit, what do you think I am?

1324
01:32:07,105 --> 01:32:09,607
-You think I'm a coward?
-What do you think you are?

1325
01:32:09,691 --> 01:32:13,736
Enough of that shit, already. I'm bored.
I'm bored with it, all right?

1326
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:30,878
Hey, hey. Jeez, look at this.
You're beautiful, babe.

1327
01:32:30,962 --> 01:32:33,881
Hey, come on. We got the winners here.
Let's get a table. Let's go.

1328
01:32:33,965 --> 01:32:36,217
Yeah. Let's get a table.

1329
01:32:38,261 --> 01:32:40,930
-How you doing?
-I'm all right.

1330
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:45,226
What happened to your face, huh?

1331
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:47,311
I cut myself shaving.

1332
01:32:47,812 --> 01:32:49,730
With a switchblade, huh?

1333
01:32:49,814 --> 01:32:51,398
Come on.

1334
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:03,911
Climb aboard my magic carpet

1335
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:08,749
and let us take a ride to the oasis.

1336
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:10,960
Feel the power.

1337
01:33:37,529 --> 01:33:40,030
Open sesame.

1338
01:33:49,791 --> 01:33:52,126
A big hand
for Shirley and Charles Tuck.

1339
01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:54,545
Give them a big hand.
Come on, everybody.

1340
01:33:54,671 --> 01:33:57,548
What are you booing?
Come on, be cool, everybody.

1341
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:00,551
No way. No good. No way.

1342
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:01,844
Yes!

1343
01:34:02,345 --> 01:34:05,306
Now we have Stephanie Mangano
and Tony Manero!

1344
01:34:06,057 --> 01:34:07,308
Come on.

1345
01:34:07,392 --> 01:34:08,809
All right.

1346
01:34:15,025 --> 01:34:16,900
Joey, hey, give me
another one of those, huh?

1347
01:34:17,027 --> 01:34:18,319
Hey, come on, you had enough.

1348
01:34:18,403 --> 01:34:19,903
Come on. I like it.
They're good. Come on.

1349
01:34:19,988 --> 01:34:21,905
All right. Get high.
You know, it's your head.

1350
01:34:22,032 --> 01:34:24,575
-That's right.
-Here you go.

1351
01:37:44,234 --> 01:37:46,610
Right on! That is the money.

1352
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:56,537
Hey! Hey, be cool, baby!

1353
01:37:56,621 --> 01:37:59,790
Here now, we have couple number 15,
the Puerto Ricans...

1354
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:12,886
Wrong neighborhood, huh?

1355
01:38:12,971 --> 01:38:15,722
Tony, listen to me,
you're gonna take the prize.

1356
01:38:57,307 --> 01:38:59,182
Jesus Christ. They're so fucking good.

1357
01:38:59,267 --> 01:39:00,934
How could they be? They're spics.

1358
01:39:01,019 --> 01:39:03,437
Look at them greasing up the floor.

1359
01:39:55,156 --> 01:39:56,698
Numero uno!

1360
01:39:57,408 --> 01:39:59,076
No contest, man. No contest.

1361
01:39:59,202 --> 01:40:01,495
I don't want to hear that shit.
They was fucking better than us.

1362
01:40:01,579 --> 01:40:03,997
They weren't better, they was different,
that's all. Just different.

1363
01:40:04,082 --> 01:40:06,249
-Bullshit.
-All right, folks!

1364
01:40:06,334 --> 01:40:08,085
We have the decision of the judges.

1365
01:40:08,211 --> 01:40:11,338
In third place,
we have Elizabeth and Joseph Cursa!

1366
01:40:11,422 --> 01:40:12,923
Give them a hand!

1367
01:40:13,007 --> 01:40:14,341
Baby!

1368
01:40:15,009 --> 01:40:16,301
Come on, baby.

1369
01:40:16,386 --> 01:40:17,427
Yeah!

1370
01:40:21,015 --> 01:40:22,516
Second prize!

1371
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:26,269
From Puerto Rico, we have
Cesar Rodriguez, Maria Huerta!

1372
01:40:29,357 --> 01:40:32,901
-You're doing them a favor!
-They're gonna take the prize.

1373
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:35,028
-Thank you.
-Unbelievable!

1374
01:40:35,113 --> 01:40:37,364
-Don't spend it in one place, baby.
-Thank you.

1375
01:40:38,408 --> 01:40:40,867
In first place, the coolest,

1376
01:40:40,952 --> 01:40:42,869
the Fred Astaire of Brooklyn,
the boogie-woogie man,

1377
01:40:42,954 --> 01:40:45,455
the man who gave you coolness,
hotness and everything you wanted.

1378
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:47,958
He was hot! He was right on!

1379
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:50,627
Stephanie Mangano and Tony Manero.

1380
01:40:52,922 --> 01:40:54,297
We won.

1381
01:40:57,635 --> 01:40:59,928
Come on. Come on!

1382
01:41:03,307 --> 01:41:04,933
Didn't I tell you?

1383
01:41:09,147 --> 01:41:10,480
Won.

1384
01:41:19,157 --> 01:41:20,991
Come on, let's boogie.
Come on, everybody.

1385
01:41:21,159 --> 01:41:24,453
It's over. Come on, let's dance.
Come on, everybody!

1386
01:41:32,128 --> 01:41:34,921
Man, you put them down,
is what you did, huh?

1387
01:41:35,006 --> 01:41:36,506
You phony bastards!

1388
01:41:36,591 --> 01:41:38,842
You know who should have won
that contest.

1389
01:41:38,926 --> 01:41:41,011
My own fucking friends
can't even be straight with me.

1390
01:41:41,137 --> 01:41:43,013
You gotta lie
right through your fucking teeth.

1391
01:41:43,139 --> 01:41:44,848
-Come on!
-What's up your ass, man?

1392
01:41:44,974 --> 01:41:47,934
-Look, we won it.
-Stephanie, that was rigged.

1393
01:41:48,019 --> 01:41:50,604
That's like family. They can't give it
to no spic or no stranger.

1394
01:41:50,688 --> 01:41:51,772
What are you, crazy?

1395
01:41:51,856 --> 01:41:54,775
We was just as good
as they were, Tony, and I know it.

1396
01:41:54,859 --> 01:41:57,027
-Oh, you think so, huh?
-Yeah!

1397
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:02,199
Here. Come with me.

1398
01:42:03,534 --> 01:42:06,870
Excuse me. Congratulations. Here.

1399
01:42:06,954 --> 01:42:08,538
I'd like to give this,
I'd like to give you that,

1400
01:42:08,664 --> 01:42:11,166
'cause I think you deserve it, all right?
Come on.

1401
01:42:12,043 --> 01:42:14,795
God damn it! Good is good.
If the spics are good, they deserve it.

1402
01:42:14,879 --> 01:42:16,797
-That's all there is to it.
-Yeah, but we won it. They didn't.

1403
01:42:16,881 --> 01:42:19,633
This is a fucking shit hole,
you know that? A fucking shit hole!

1404
01:42:19,717 --> 01:42:22,469
God damn it.
My friends, the assholes I hang out with,

1405
01:42:22,553 --> 01:42:24,971
I can't believe them sometimes.
You know that?

1406
01:42:25,056 --> 01:42:28,058
Everybody's gotta dump
on somebody, right? Of course.

1407
01:42:28,142 --> 01:42:30,727
I mean, everybody...
Everybody can't do it straight, right?

1408
01:42:30,812 --> 01:42:32,813
My pa goes to work,
he gets dumped on,

1409
01:42:32,897 --> 01:42:34,648
so he comes home
and he dumps on my mother, right?

1410
01:42:34,732 --> 01:42:36,733
Of course, right?
Then the spics, they dump on us,

1411
01:42:36,859 --> 01:42:38,902
so we gotta dump on spics.
Of course, right?

1412
01:42:39,028 --> 01:42:41,571
Everybody's dumping on everybody.

1413
01:42:41,739 --> 01:42:44,241
Even the humping's dumping
most of the time.

1414
01:42:44,325 --> 01:42:47,661
All right. Okay. Listen, would you just
tell me what's wrong? Okay?

1415
01:42:47,745 --> 01:42:48,912
-Get in.
-What is it?

1416
01:42:49,038 --> 01:42:51,081
-Get in!
-Just tell me.

1417
01:42:58,256 --> 01:43:00,715
What the hell is wrong with you?

1418
01:43:06,556 --> 01:43:09,850
Wait. Stop it. Look, just stop it!

1419
01:43:09,934 --> 01:43:12,602
Let me alone, man!
Come on. Get away!

1420
01:43:12,728 --> 01:43:14,604
You know, you're such
a fucking cockteaser, you know that?

1421
01:43:14,730 --> 01:43:16,523
Don't you fucking call me
no goddamn cockteaser!

1422
01:43:16,607 --> 01:43:17,691
You are a cockteaser!

1423
01:43:17,775 --> 01:43:19,609
-Why you hanging around with me?
-Dancing, that's why.

1424
01:43:19,735 --> 01:43:21,528
-Oh, dancing, huh? Why else?
-Yeah!

1425
01:43:21,612 --> 01:43:24,030
You wanna know?
It's bullshit, that's why. Bullshit, man.

1426
01:43:24,115 --> 01:43:26,616
I've just been
dumping my bullshit all over you,

1427
01:43:26,742 --> 01:43:28,034
selling my act on you,

1428
01:43:28,119 --> 01:43:30,287
using you,
making you think that I love you!

1429
01:43:30,413 --> 01:43:32,205
It's just all bullshit, man!

1430
01:43:32,290 --> 01:43:36,293
-You fucking cunt!
-Don't fucking start! You stop it! Don't!

1431
01:43:38,087 --> 01:43:39,629
Get off of me.

1432
01:43:40,965 --> 01:43:42,465
Oh, Stephanie.

1433
01:43:58,983 --> 01:44:01,151
-I'm mad at you, Tony.
-Hey, Tony, come on.

1434
01:44:01,235 --> 01:44:03,153
Annette's gonna give everybody
a piece of snatch pie.

1435
01:44:03,279 --> 01:44:04,487
Yeah.

1436
01:44:04,822 --> 01:44:07,324
Oh, yeah? The fuck you are.
I wanna talk to you.

1437
01:44:07,450 --> 01:44:09,743
-Hey, what are you doing?
-What is with you, huh?

1438
01:44:09,827 --> 01:44:12,078
-What's with you, you little punk?
-What are you doing?

1439
01:44:12,163 --> 01:44:15,749
-What is it, man? What the fuck is it?
-You don't give a shit about her!

1440
01:44:18,753 --> 01:44:21,004
Come on, Annette. Get in the car.

1441
01:44:29,597 --> 01:44:31,806
Come on. Do it.

1442
01:44:37,355 --> 01:44:40,106
I told you.
You can fuck all night on this speed.

1443
01:44:40,191 --> 01:44:41,441
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah, you will.

1444
01:44:41,525 --> 01:44:43,526
Joey, what you doing back there?

1445
01:44:43,653 --> 01:44:45,528
Hey, you fuck.
The first is always the best.

1446
01:44:45,655 --> 01:44:47,197
That's right.

1447
01:44:55,831 --> 01:44:57,666
Yes. Yes.

1448
01:44:58,834 --> 01:45:00,210
Joey?

1449
01:45:02,046 --> 01:45:03,380
Oh, God.

1450
01:45:08,386 --> 01:45:11,554
Come on, Double J. You're up.

1451
01:45:11,681 --> 01:45:13,723
See you guys later, huh?

1452
01:45:16,894 --> 01:45:19,396
-No. Joey.
-Come on, mother.

1453
01:45:19,563 --> 01:45:21,398
-Oh, yeah! My turn.
-No. You know what?

1454
01:45:21,482 --> 01:45:24,567
No, Double J. No, I don't wanna do it.

1455
01:45:29,699 --> 01:45:31,533
Fuck-A!

1456
01:45:34,078 --> 01:45:36,579
Shit. With me she's gotta cry?

1457
01:45:36,664 --> 01:45:40,250
-God damn, Annette. Come on.
-No. No. Don't.

1458
01:45:40,376 --> 01:45:41,835
Come on.

1459
01:45:52,596 --> 01:45:53,763
Yeah!

1460
01:45:58,686 --> 01:46:01,104
Fuck! Double J!

1461
01:46:01,188 --> 01:46:03,690
Come on, Double J! Come on!

1462
01:46:09,739 --> 01:46:13,783
-Give me a beer huh?
-Hey! Hey! With no pants.

1463
01:46:13,868 --> 01:46:15,702
And no hands!

1464
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:18,121
Here, beer.

1465
01:46:20,708 --> 01:46:23,126
-All right!
-All right.

1466
01:46:23,377 --> 01:46:26,463
Fuck you, Manhattan!
Come to Brooklyn!

1467
01:46:30,551 --> 01:46:32,802
Mine's so big, I gotta strap it to my leg.

1468
01:46:32,887 --> 01:46:35,638
Anita says
I got the biggest thing in town.

1469
01:46:36,766 --> 01:46:38,641
Proud of yourself now?

1470
01:46:39,477 --> 01:46:42,479
Is that what you wanted? Good.

1471
01:46:44,482 --> 01:46:46,232
Now you're a cunt.

1472
01:46:47,651 --> 01:46:50,487
Man, don't fuck around.
What are you doing?

1473
01:46:53,407 --> 01:46:55,575
Where you going? Annette.

1474
01:47:01,499 --> 01:47:04,084
No. No. No. Leave me.

1475
01:47:07,671 --> 01:47:09,839
Come on, Annette. I'm sorry.

1476
01:47:11,634 --> 01:47:15,512
-Annette, I said I'm sorry.
-I didn't want to do it.

1477
01:47:17,473 --> 01:47:18,848
Look at this guy.

1478
01:47:18,933 --> 01:47:20,934
Hey, Bobby! Hey, you punk!

1479
01:47:21,018 --> 01:47:23,686
Tony! Look at me!

1480
01:47:23,813 --> 01:47:27,357
-Look at the punk.
-Bobby, get down. It's too dangerous.

1481
01:47:27,441 --> 01:47:32,278
Look at me, Tony.
Hey, Tony, look at me!

1482
01:47:32,363 --> 01:47:34,489
Look! Hey, Tony!

1483
01:47:36,158 --> 01:47:38,368
I'm not kidding, Bobby.
Get down from there.

1484
01:47:38,452 --> 01:47:40,703
I'm all right. I'm all right.

1485
01:47:41,872 --> 01:47:45,375
I'm all right, Tony.
I'm all right. Watch me.

1486
01:47:53,717 --> 01:47:57,137
-Hey, Tony, look at me!
-That's crazy. Now you're being crazy.

1487
01:47:57,221 --> 01:47:59,222
Look at me, look at me, look at me.
I'm doing it.

1488
01:47:59,306 --> 01:48:00,557
-It's too dangerous.
-Look at me.

1489
01:48:00,641 --> 01:48:02,517
-I see you.
-Look at me.

1490
01:48:04,019 --> 01:48:05,478
Oh, Jesus.

1491
01:48:08,482 --> 01:48:10,900
It's a long way down there.

1492
01:48:12,403 --> 01:48:14,487
-Give me your hand.
-I did it!

1493
01:48:14,572 --> 01:48:16,990
Come back. Come back in. Come on.

1494
01:48:19,410 --> 01:48:20,743
-Watch.
-Don't, don't.

1495
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:23,580
You're making me
very nervous now, Bobby.

1496
01:48:23,664 --> 01:48:25,832
Don't do that. Jesus Christ.

1497
01:48:25,916 --> 01:48:29,836
Get over here. Get over here, right now!
Give me your hand.

1498
01:48:31,088 --> 01:48:33,756
Oh, Jesus! No. No!

1499
01:48:33,841 --> 01:48:36,176
-Oh, come on.
-I did it.

1500
01:48:36,260 --> 01:48:39,095
-What did you do?
-I did it.

1501
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:40,430
Watch.

1502
01:48:44,351 --> 01:48:47,103
Come on, Bobby. Get over here.
Right now. Come on.

1503
01:48:47,229 --> 01:48:48,938
Now, don't get upset.
Come on. We'll talk.

1504
01:48:49,064 --> 01:48:51,024
We'll go talk in the car.
It's warmer there.

1505
01:48:51,108 --> 01:48:53,443
You didn't talk to me before.

1506
01:48:54,695 --> 01:48:57,071
How come you never called me?

1507
01:49:00,117 --> 01:49:02,535
-I didn't wanna fuck up.
-You didn't fuck up, Bobby.

1508
01:49:02,620 --> 01:49:06,789
-Come on. We'll talk, all right?
-I didn't wanna fuck up this time.

1509
01:49:12,630 --> 01:49:17,550
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

1510
01:49:28,020 --> 01:49:29,229
No!

1511
01:49:40,783 --> 01:49:43,743
Any of you guys think
maybe he killed himself?

1512
01:49:43,827 --> 01:49:45,036
No.

1513
01:49:49,375 --> 01:49:52,293
There's ways of killing yourself
without killing yourself.

1514
01:49:52,378 --> 01:49:55,713
Yeah. Okay, you can go now.

1515
01:50:01,637 --> 01:50:02,845
Forget the number, Chief.

1516
01:50:02,930 --> 01:50:05,765
We ain't gonna find nothing
out there tonight.

1517
01:50:09,061 --> 01:50:10,228
Shit.

1518
01:50:24,576 --> 01:50:25,702
Ton?

1519
01:50:26,495 --> 01:50:27,870
Hey, Tony!

1520
01:52:35,666 --> 01:52:37,041
Stephanie?

1521
01:52:39,795 --> 01:52:42,422
-Is that you?
-Yeah, it's me, Stephanie.

1522
01:52:42,506 --> 01:52:44,674
Hey, look, look,
I'm really sorry about last night.

1523
01:52:44,758 --> 01:52:48,094
-You're sorry?
-Yeah, I'm sorry, Stephanie. I just...

1524
01:52:48,178 --> 01:52:50,888
Look, it won't happen again,
I promise you.

1525
01:52:50,973 --> 01:52:52,890
I just... I just, I really need to talk to you.

1526
01:52:52,975 --> 01:52:55,768
What are you talking about,
you need to talk to me?

1527
01:52:55,853 --> 01:52:58,771
It's just like what I said.
I need to talk to you.

1528
01:53:00,941 --> 01:53:02,775
Okay, listen. Now, if I open this door,

1529
01:53:02,860 --> 01:53:05,111
you're not gonna pull
any funny stuff on me, right?

1530
01:53:05,195 --> 01:53:06,988
No, of course not.

1531
01:53:18,333 --> 01:53:21,043
First time I ever let a known rapist
in my apartment.

1532
01:53:21,128 --> 01:53:24,130
Hey, look, I'll just stay right here,
all right?

1533
01:53:24,214 --> 01:53:28,509
So, that way you don't think that I'm
gonna, you know, jump you or nothing.

1534
01:53:31,388 --> 01:53:33,556
What's wrong with you, man?

1535
01:53:37,728 --> 01:53:40,104
Nothing. I'll tell you later. Right?

1536
01:53:42,065 --> 01:53:45,860
Well, you can’t just stand there.
This is ridiculous. Come on.

1537
01:53:49,072 --> 01:53:51,616
I've been up all night
just walking and looking around.

1538
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:54,827
And, you know,
I'm gonna get myself my own place.

1539
01:53:54,912 --> 01:53:56,204
You know what I'm gonna do?

1540
01:53:56,288 --> 01:53:57,914
I'm getting my money,
I'm coming back, you know.

1541
01:53:57,998 --> 01:53:59,248
'Cause I ain't going back there.

1542
01:53:59,333 --> 01:54:02,710
Wait a minute. Why don't you sit down,
okay? Come on.

1543
01:54:06,548 --> 01:54:09,300
-So, what are you doing?
-What am I doing?

1544
01:54:09,384 --> 01:54:12,678
I'm just not going back there, that's all.
They're assholes back there.

1545
01:54:12,763 --> 01:54:15,014
-I'm fed up to here with it. It's bullshit.
-Okay. Okay.

1546
01:54:15,098 --> 01:54:16,891
What are you gonna do?

1547
01:54:16,975 --> 01:54:19,101
What do you do?
You come in. You get a job. You know.

1548
01:54:19,186 --> 01:54:21,145
Do what you do. Get a nice apartment.

1549
01:54:21,230 --> 01:54:23,356
Okay, what kind of job?

1550
01:54:25,150 --> 01:54:26,984
I don't know.

1551
01:54:27,069 --> 01:54:29,153
What did you do? You came in,
you couldn't do nothing, right?

1552
01:54:29,238 --> 01:54:31,405
I could type when I came.

1553
01:54:33,659 --> 01:54:37,078
No big deal. I'm an able person.
I mean, I can do these things.

1554
01:54:37,162 --> 01:54:39,205
Yeah, of course you can.

1555
01:54:41,542 --> 01:54:44,126
Tony, I wanna tell you something.

1556
01:54:45,045 --> 01:54:48,381
Now, you know, I said
all that stuff to you about...

1557
01:54:49,299 --> 01:54:52,677
Using you,
practicing my act on you, you know?

1558
01:54:53,303 --> 01:54:54,804
It wasn't true.

1559
01:54:54,888 --> 01:54:58,140
There's a lot of other reasons
that I was hanging around you.

1560
01:54:58,225 --> 01:55:01,477
-What do you mean?
-You made me feel better.

1561
01:55:03,063 --> 01:55:06,440
You gave me, like, admiration,
you know? Respect.

1562
01:55:07,526 --> 01:55:08,859
Support.

1563
01:55:13,407 --> 01:55:17,743
Stephanie, maybe now that, you know,
like, I'm gonna be in town like I planned,

1564
01:55:17,828 --> 01:55:20,580
maybe, like, we could see each other.

1565
01:55:21,873 --> 01:55:25,042
No, I don't mean like that.
I know what you're thinking.

1566
01:55:25,127 --> 01:55:27,920
You're thinking, like,
I'm promoting your pussy, but I ain't.

1567
01:55:28,005 --> 01:55:29,714
I mean, like, friends, right?

1568
01:55:29,798 --> 01:55:33,009
You know, like you once said,
we could help each other.

1569
01:55:33,093 --> 01:55:36,887
-Wanna be friends?
-Yeah. I'd like to be friends with you.

1570
01:55:39,141 --> 01:55:41,601
Think you know how, huh?

1571
01:55:41,685 --> 01:55:43,436
Think you could be friends with a girl?

1572
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:46,480
Could you stand
being friends with a girl, huh?

1573
01:55:47,441 --> 01:55:48,816
-The truth?
-Yeah.

1574
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:50,109
I don't know.

1575
01:55:51,194 --> 01:55:52,445
I don't know. I mean, I could try.

1576
01:55:52,529 --> 01:55:55,364
That's all I can say, Stephanie.
I could try.

1577
01:56:01,455 --> 01:56:03,497
Okay. Okay.

1578
01:56:04,583 --> 01:56:07,877
Let's be friends, all right?
We'll just be friends.

1579
01:56:09,171 --> 01:56:10,546
All right.

1580
01:56:11,673 --> 01:56:12,673
Okay.

1581
01:56:17,346 --> 01:56:20,346
Friends, man.
