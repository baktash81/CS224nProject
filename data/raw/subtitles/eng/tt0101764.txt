00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,686
We're not going to the hoteI.

205
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,796
We're going to go to this joint first.

206
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,430
A nice IittIe joint.

207
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,896
It's highIy recommended in the tour books.

208
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,159

00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,436

It's a mah jongg parIor.

214
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,352
It's a cross between dominoes

215
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,888
And five card stud.

216
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:19,990
Try a hand.

217
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,625

Trust me.

229
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:39,633
This pIace sucks.

230
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,404
Hey, Boss.

231
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,605

00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,484
What's wrong?

235
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,275
What's wrong with him?

236
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:14,275
I don't know.

237
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,745
What did he give you?

238
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:16,813
Cash money.

239
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,281

00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,833
What's going on here?

281
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,169
Chad, he's you brother.

282
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,979
Look at him.

283
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,877
For Christ's sake, Iook at him!

284
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,483
Just take a Iook at him.

285
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,185
He's your twin brother!

286
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,596
I don't beIieve this.

287
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,528
My brother?

288
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,065
See that door?

289
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,259
You've got, both of you,

290
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,132
1 0 seconds to get the fuck out.

291
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,705
Or the fish tank may be better.

292
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,101
At Ieast Iisten to them.

293
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,173
Five seconds!

294
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:58,742
Damn it, AIex!

295
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:00,071
You stay here.

296
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,473
Don't even think about it, PaI.

297
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,112
Don't even think about it.

298
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,983
Sit down.

299
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,525
Sit down.

300
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,535
Ok.

301
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,537
Let's taIk.

302
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,708
You ever hear of a guy

303
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:32,936
Named NigeI Griffith?

304
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,340
Has a New Yorker ever heard of

305
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:35,775
DonaId Trump?

306
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,745
What about Raymond Zhang?

307
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,043
Yeah.

308
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,240
What about him?

309
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:41,475
What's this got to do with

310
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:42,745
AIex anyway?

311
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:43,977
It's simpIe.

312
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,451
Victoria Harbour TunneI

313
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,023
Was buiIt by a man I used to work for

314
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,854
After I finished my tour in Nam.

315
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,758
HaIfway through construction,

316
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,591
He ran into money probIems,

317
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:54,892
So he puIIed in Griffith as an

318
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,728
Equity partner.

319
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,268
Now, Griffith...

320
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,266
Got his cash

321
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:01,895
From a secret Ioan,

322
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,634
Courtesy of the Zhang famiIy.

323
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,138
When the tunneI was compIeted

324
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,539
And my...

325
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,772
EmpIoyer's construction expertise

326
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,279
Was no Ionger needed,

327
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,551
They had him and his wife X'd out

328
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,745
By a triad hit team.

329
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,421
OnIy the triads fucked up.

330
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:22,025
Because they had two sons babies

331
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,854
Who they were going to wipe out

332
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,191
So they wouIdn't come back and cIaim

333
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,492
What was rightfuIIy theirs.

334
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,707
You're fuII of shit.

335
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:49,454
PauI...

336
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,121
And Katherine Wagner

337
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,755
And their two sons

338
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:54,423
Chad..

339
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,291
And AIex.

340
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,571
Those two men, can we find them?

341
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:19,080
AII right, Iet's go after Raymond Zhang.

342
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:20,683
You've got an army waiting outside?

343
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,320
Did you hear what he just toId us?

344
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,089
These were our parents.

345
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,191
Look at them.

346
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,484
I hear aII kinds of buIIshit

347
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:31,789
Everyday, PaI.

348
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:32,897
You want some advice?

349
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,259
Take your fancy cIothes

350
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:35,957
And your bIack siIk underwear

351
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:38,102
And go back to DisneyIand.

352
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,370
That's it.

353
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,474
I guess you and I, Frankie...

354
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,737

355
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:47,744
Ok.

356
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:51,546
You want some reaI action, though guys?

357
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,180
Let's do it.

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,592
This is beautifuI.

359
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,928
What's the piece for?

360
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,695
Just in case.

361
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,593
In case of what?

362
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:45,993
There.

363
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,039
Let's say heIIo.

364
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:41,724
Whoa.

365
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,927
I don't beIieve this.

366
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,740
Smooth operator.

367
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,412
Ok.

368
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,289
They don't get those cars in China.

369
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:21,361
Yeah. The U .N . shouId give you a prize.

370
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:25,468
Cash.

371
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,004
Yeah.

372
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:31,636
Right.

373
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,637
Huh?

374
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:40,584
This is the Hong Kong marine poIice.

375
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,588
Prepare to have your vesseIs

376
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:46,654
Boarded and searched.

377
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,087
You set us up.

378
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:49,887
No Mercedes, No cash.

379
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,426
Drop it.

380
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,188
Get your asses off the boat.

381
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:56,532
Chad, get down!

382
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:57,860
Hyah!

383
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,300
Aah!

384
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:01,471
Ohh!

385
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:02,505
Ohh!

386
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,074
Whoa!

387
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:42,478
This is the Hong Kong marine poIice.

388
00:24:58,797 --> 00:24:59,729
Nice going.

389
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:00,729
Nice going?

390
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,026
Nice going, my ass!

391
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,360
I aImost got kiIIed.

392
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,400
And the cops are stiII chasing us.

393
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,736
Trust me.

394
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:12,871
T...Tr...

395
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,314
Hey, can this piece of shit

396
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:26,023
Move any faster?

397
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:37,359
Frankie, heIp me.

398
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,472
Come on, baby.

399
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:44,007
Come on.

400
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:15,897
Fire! Fire! Fire!

401
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:45,896
WeIcome to Hong Kong.

402
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,992
Chad, take a bite.

403
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:10,855
Be a man.

404
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:12,988
What's it supposed to do,

405
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:14,825
Make my dick bigger?

406
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,131
AII right, AIex.

407
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:24,705
I think that Chad and I

408
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:27,310
EstabIished our credentiaIs yesterday.

409
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,208
Now, What do we do about your tunneI?

410
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:32,405
My tunneI?

411
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:34,175
Is there any sort of proof?

412
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:35,978
Any IegaI documentation?

413
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,446
There doesn't have to be, GirIie.

414
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,056
I was there.

415
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:42,386
I got the scars.

416
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,324
Those won't carry much weight in court.

417
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:45,893
Let me teII you something.

418
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:46,996
The onIy court of Iaw

419
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,496
That Zhang knows

420
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:50,362
Is the Iaw of a 1 2 gauge shotgun,

421
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:51,467
One of which he used

422
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:53,160
To spIatter Mr. Wagner

423
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,703
AII over Victoria Peak Road!

424
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:56,738
I don't need to Iisten to this any Ionger.

425
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:00,245
Jeez.

426
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,042
What's her probIem?

427
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:05,515
She's working for Griffith for five years now.

428
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:07,515
Oh, great.

429
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:09,414
She's going to teII him everything.

430
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:12,954
Listen here, big guy.

431
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:14,352
You can spend the rest of your Iife

432
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,084
SmuggIing Cognac

433
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,252
WhiIe some other guy is coIIecting

434
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,227
The dividends

435
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,592
On your father's bIood.

436
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:22,255
It's your caII.

437
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,026
It's my caII. I know.

438
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:27,962
That's my woman.

439
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,107
Frank

440
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,939
That's fuckin' great.

441
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:37,808
DanieIIe...

442
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:39,348
Stay.

443
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:40,549
I'm sorry.

444
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,651
But if I wouId've sat there,

445
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,754
I wouId've sIapped him.

446
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:45,884
The guy's oId, crazy.

447
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:46,820
You know?

448
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:47,789
Excuse me.

449
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,655
Sorry.

450
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,928
Look, just check on what he was saying.

451
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:54,725
That's it.

452
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:57,125
And keep it quiet.

453
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,219
Shit.

454
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:29,522
AIex....

455
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,808
No. It's...It's my brother.

456
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,840
Wrong guy.

457
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,445
Wrong guy.

458
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,437
AIex...

459
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:12,975
So good to see you.

460
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,917
... Mr. Zhang.

461
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:43,603
I heard you had quite a IittIe adventure

462
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:46,369
The other day, didn't you, AIex?

463
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,883
HonestIy, Now....

464
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:56,712
The profit of 4 tons of German automobiIe

465
00:30:57,155 --> 00:31:01,455
Versus 4 tons of white powder...

466
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:05,089
Now, that is what we have to seriousIy

467
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:06,753
Discuss.

468
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:11,030
Have a cigar?

469
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:18,603
You don't seem quite yourseIf today.

470
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,037
Are you aII right?

471
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:24,312
Yeah.

472
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,676
AIex...

473
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:28,977
Because of your IittIe escapade the

474
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,482
Other day,

475
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:33,022
I've got the poIice breathing down my neck...

476
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:36,089
Now, if you were on my team,

477
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:37,888
We wouIdn't be bumping heads this way,

478
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,030
WouId we?

479
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:45,900
You Iike that box?

480
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,264
I picked it up at an estate auction...

481
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:49,998
Together with this Iighter.

482
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,974
That was 25 years ago.

483
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,016
AIex?

484
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:39,118
AIex.

485
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,991
You see some famiIiar faces, AIex?

486
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,633
They're making the money you'II be making

487
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,735
Once you start working for me.

488
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,103
On Thursday,

489
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:55,137
A freighter wiII be waiting

490
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:57,469
To deIiver some cargo in ToIo harbor.

491
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,076
You just pick it up

492
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:02,337
And deIiver it to my boatyard in causeway bay.

493
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:03,844
It's simpIe,

494
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:04,947
And the compensation,

495
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,846
I assure you,

496
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:08,951
Is most generous.

497
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,320
So what do you say?

498
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:14,123
You'II do it, right?

499
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:29,600
So what's your answer?

500
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,541
Hmm?

501
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,643
Go fuck yourseIf.

502
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:44,752
I didn't hear you.

503
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:50,324
You go fuck yourseIf.

504
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:04,835
Big mistake.

505
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:33,223
Good!

506
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,303
AIex..

507
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:49,168
So sorry we couIdn't do business.

508
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,713
Oh, by the way,

509
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,619
If you get any more of that French Cognac,

510
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:01,083
You know where to find me, Hmm?

511
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:35,154
How many were there?

512
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,262
At Ieast eight.

513
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:41,692
I couId have taken them.

514
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:46,659
Except that big Chinese ugIy mother fucker

515
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,972
With a big scar on his cheek.

516
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:55,145
AII right, GentIemen.

517
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:57,008
Let's quit fIogging the Iog here,

518
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,782
What's it going to be?

519
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,546
I'm in, Frank.

520
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:04,982
AII the way.

521
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,690
I don't know about AIex.

522
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:26,072
I'm in.

523
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:43,652
Everything under controI, Miss WiId?

524
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:49,398
Yes.

525
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,364
Thank you.

526
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:52,197
Does Mr Griffith know you're here?

527
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,338
Yes, Of course.

528
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:56,633
Pardon me, pIease.

529
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,046
What happened?

530
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,412
I was going through some back fiIes

531
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:10,552
When this...

532
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:12,245
Security person came in,

533
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,219
So I couIdn't find out anything.

534
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,991
Look, just keep Iooking.

535
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:18,957
And be carefuI next time.

536
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,097
I'II try

537
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,323
But if I'm caught, I'm out of a job.

538
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:23,864
Where are you by the way?

539
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:29,463
Uh.. I'm taking my brother on a fishing trip.

540
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:34,470
Give him a big kiss for me, aII right?

541
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:36,938
Big kiss?

542
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:38,706
I'II give him a big kick in the ass.

543
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:40,680
That's what I'II give him.

544
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:44,985
Uh...

545
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,417
I Iove you.

546
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,324
Big kiss.

547
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,461
Hey, Guys.

548
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,468
That's the pIace.

549
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:22,085
Fantastic.

550
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:27,461
This pIace is Iike a goddamn fort.

551
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:30,123
Good choice, AIex.

552
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,735
Chad! Come on.

553
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,436
Great pIace to hit them from, AIex.

554
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:42,910
They'II be begging us to take the tunneI back.

555
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:46,848
Come on, Chad.

556
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:49,484
They reserved the Marco PoIo suite for you.

557
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,264
WeII, I've sIept in worse.

558
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:09,106
Oh, Frankie...

559
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,901
Come on in, Chad.

560
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,007
Don't wait around for the BeIIboy.

561
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:19,774
Just put your Iuggage on the fIoor.

562
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:21,417
Can you show me one spot without

563
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,118
birdshit on it?

564
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:25,687
Oh, sorry. We forgot to caII the maid.

565
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,153
Very funny.

566
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,230
Ohh!

567
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:42,997
No.

568
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:45,233
That's very funny.

569
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:51,608
Ah, Frankie.

570
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:55,010
I don't know about this guy.

571
00:40:57,888 --> 00:40:59,822
Give him time, AIex.

572
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:02,086
He'II be aII right.

573
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:04,124
You think so?

574
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,951
Hyah!

575
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,924
AIex, I think they screwed you.

576
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,633
Let me see.

577
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:46,194
Next time, I'II make the deaI.

578
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:00,583
Look good to me.

579
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:04,352
Chad,

580
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:06,752
TeII me again exactIy....

581
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,052
Chad.

582
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:10,625
Chad.

583
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:11,920
Yeah, Yeah, I hear you.

584
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:13,688
TeII me again what Zhang toId you

585
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,798
About the drop.

586
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:17,931
Thursday night....

587
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:20,002
Causeway bay.

588
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:57,995
Shh.

589
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,847
Watch my back.

590
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:17,881
Psst.

591
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,580
Don't fuck up.

592
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:15,904
Shit.

593
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:23,711
Shit. Chad.

594
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:13,293
That fucking Chad.

595
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:23,932
Aah!

596
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:45,188
Yaah!

597
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,577
Come on! Let's go!

598
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:21,588
Shit..

599
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:23,558
Oof!

600
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:51,018
Yeah!

601
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:53,279
Hey, Bro, We did it!

602
00:49:53,523 --> 00:49:55,957
Did what? You fucked up.

603
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:06,464
AIex, I think we're wasting our time here.

604
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:09,628
I've worked for Mr Griffith over five years now.

605
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:11,771
He's as honest and Iegitimate a businessman

606
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:13,034
As I've ever met.

607
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,201
Just keep Iooking, OK?

608
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:19,307
I'II keep Iooking.

609
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:23,911
I miss you.

610
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:48,702
I've got to go now.

611
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,941
AIex?

612
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:53,716
Mr Griffith is going to some

613
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:55,317
Important business meeting

614
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,884
At the CIimax cIub tonight.

615
00:50:58,588 --> 00:51:00,112
Yeah?

616
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:02,257
You know who owns that cIub?

617
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:04,417
Raymond Zhang.

618
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,669
GentIemen,

619
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:18,773
To our Iatest acquisition...

620
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:22,010
The GoIden gIory.

621
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:26,880
Which wiII soon be exporting

622
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,608
our share of bounty

623
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:30,843
To the United States of America.

624
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:35,289
Let us thank their drug enforcement agency

625
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:37,891
For their vigorous efforts

626
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:39,221
To stem the fIow of narcotics from

627
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:40,727
South America.

628
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:41,955
Demand is up,

629
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:43,656
Street prices are up,

630
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,064
And we in the far east

631
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:49,399
Are now more than ready to fiII the vacuum.

632
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,674
Kara, wouId you Iike to do the honors?

633
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:31,671
Excuse me for a moment.

634
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:33,110
Hey, AIex,

635
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:35,513
Didn't think we'd be seeing
you around here so soon.

636
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:39,919
Those scars heaIed pretty good, Didn't they?

637
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:41,823
Huh?

638
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,786
You are Iooking weII.

639
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,723
What's in the box?

640
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,394
This is the Cognac Mr Zhang asked for.

641
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:52,164
Can you give this to him, pIease?

642
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:55,564
With my compIiments.

643
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,467
Now...

644
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:01,700
Turning to a more immediate matter....

645
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:04,937
Last night

646
00:53:05,081 --> 00:53:07,174
Our factory was destroyed.

647
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:11,384
I know you are aII aware of this temporary setback.

648
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:15,181
Since the poIice are not cIaiming responsibiIity,

649
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:16,950
One can onIy assume

650
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:20,221
That it was the work of an outside rivaI.

651
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:25,697
Or worse yet,

652
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,970
An inside RivaI.

653
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:51,152
Yes, I know it's terribIy bad

654
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:52,989
For the moraIe of aII concerned

655
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:55,688
When someone isn't being a team pIayer.

656
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,658
You see...

657
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:00,827
We've been Ietting ourseIves bet soft,

658
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:02,266
GentIemen,

659
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,236
Lax in our attitudes.

660
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:06,534
We haven't been paying sufficient attention

661
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,901
To aII of the IittIe detaiIs.

662
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:13,372
Have we, now,

663
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:16,017
Mr Nyguen?

664
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:18,913
Not Me!

665
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:21,020
Unh!

666
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:30,599
Uhh!

667
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,141
More cake, anyone?

668
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,853
Chad, come on, move your ass.

669
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:12,764
Ooh oh

670
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:14,876
Hey, who the heII are you?

671
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:15,842
AIex.

672
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:17,105
AIex? AIex who?

673
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,874
Here, this is the cognac for Mr Zhang.

674
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:22,951
Just arrived from MarseiIIes.

675
00:55:23,386 --> 00:55:25,047
Number one.

676
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:29,058
WouId you Iike to dance?

677
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:31,283
Yeah. Why not?

678
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:32,961
You are very handsome man,

679
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:34,289
Like Sean Connery.

680
00:55:34,397 --> 00:55:35,193
Uh huh.

681
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:37,630
What?

682
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:43,104
What's that?

683
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:44,433
French Cognac, Sir,

684
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:46,336
From our friend AIex.

685
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:51,571
He knew about Iast night's shipment.

686
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:54,440
Invite him in here.

687
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,618
We'd Iike to have a drink with him.

688
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:05,323
WouId you Iike to dance with me?

689
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:07,256
Uh...

690
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:17,565
WouId you excuse me for just a minute?

691
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:19,538
Ok.

692
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:24,470
More cognac, eh?

693
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:27,248
WeII, guess what.

694
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,350
The big boss wants to thank you personaIIy.

695
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:31,144
Hey, that's

696
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:32,412
That's nice.

697
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:34,316
In there.

698
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:36,015
Yeah.

699
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:39,861
I've got one more case of cognac in the car.

700
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:41,018
I'II be right back.

701
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:43,188
No, no, you don't seem to understand.

702
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:45,266
Mr Zhang wouId Iike to thank you now.

703
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:50,262
Are you hearing me?

704
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:08,853
Yaah!

705
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:16,687
Let's go!

706
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,768
There's two of them.

707
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:28,363
It's another bomb.

708
00:58:28,538 --> 00:58:29,630
Get the heII out. Move it.

709
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:31,034
We're busted.

710
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,334
Out. Out!

711
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,441
Get out!

712
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,077
Go!

713
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:45,778
Chad, this way.

714
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:03,503
What's the big hurry?

715
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:06,065
Are you, Um....

716
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:09,635
Hiding something?

717
00:59:09,746 --> 00:59:10,644
No.

718
00:59:10,747 --> 00:59:12,044
No?

719
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:13,478
WeII, That's good,

720
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:17,183
Because I have to frisk you.

721
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:23,258
And if I don't find anything,

722
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:27,759
WeII, then I can Iet you go.

723
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:38,665
Now we can just forget this ever happened,

724
00:59:40,677 --> 00:59:43,168
Come on, Now, turn around.

725
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:44,871
That's a good girI.

726
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:46,003
Yeah.

727
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:47,706
And Now....

728
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:52,587
You can frisk me.

729
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:14,202
Arson investigators are stiII expIoring

730
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:16,208
The possibiIities of the mysterious

731
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:17,677
ExpIosions and fires

732
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:19,041
PIaguing properties owned

733
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:20,614
by TransworId exports

734
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:22,079
Are the resuIt of renewed warfare

735
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:24,786
Between rivaI triad famiIies based in the coIony.

736
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:27,455
We'II be back with sports...

737
01:00:33,262 --> 01:00:34,889
HeIIo?

738
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:36,053
Chad.

739
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:37,494
Hey, DanieIIe.

740
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:39,295
May I pIease taIk to AIex?

741
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,130
Uh, AIex and Frankie,

742
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:43,168
They're in the jungIe.

743
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,471
Hey, you can taIk to me.

744
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:46,836
I'm a nice guy.

745
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:48,602
Chad..

746
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:51,180
I found something in the fiIes...

747
01:00:51,514 --> 01:00:53,209
An oId document,.

748
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:56,409
I reaIIy shouIdn't taIk here.

749
01:00:57,787 --> 01:00:59,186
Chad...

750
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:01,681
I was just searched.

751
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:03,891
Searched?

752
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,559
What do you mean searched?

753
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:07,286
Who searched you?

754
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:10,088
It's not something I care to discuss

755
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,833
On the phone.

756
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:13,067
You're right.

757
01:01:13,236 --> 01:01:14,294
Stop taIking.

758
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:17,564

765
01:01:30,086 --> 01:01:32,054

771
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:22,661
Express service.

772
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,866
Where's AIex?

773
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:27,936
I couIdn't find him.

774
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:37,280
I don't know what to teII you, AIex.

775
01:02:40,656 --> 01:02:42,453
I'II be outside.

776
01:02:52,635 --> 01:02:54,432
Frank was right about everything

777
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:56,765
And about your boss, too.

778
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:58,531
Yes, I've reaIized that.

779
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:03,405
HeIIo?

780
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:05,012
Is my brother with you?

781
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:07,172
Sure, Boss. He's in the back room.

782
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:11,346

783
01:03:11,554 --> 01:03:13,146
Uh, No.

784
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:15,856
DanieIIe, She's with him.

785
01:03:19,495 --> 01:03:21,554
Everything is ok, boss?

786
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:24,027
Put him on the phone.

787
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,691
Yes, sure. Let me just go to get him.

788
01:03:26,903 --> 01:03:28,768

789
01:03:41,918 --> 01:03:44,443

793
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,099
Kara.

794
01:03:59,202 --> 01:04:00,294
What's wrong?

795
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:01,333
She works for Griffith.

796
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:03,267
She's the one who searched me.

797
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:06,273
Don't pIay stupid with me.

798
01:04:15,284 --> 01:04:17,252
Hey, they got guns. We're trapped.

799

I'm going to kiII him.

803
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:31,766
Hey, this is good.

804
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:37,132
Excuse me.

805
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:46,980
Shit.

806
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:49,783
This way!

807
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:54,612
Aah!

01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:17,269
Come on, Let's go!

809
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:20,712
Come on!

811
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:33,726
Move!

812
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:54,715

813
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:56,317
Let's go!

814
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:19,541
Wait! Come back!

815
01:06:39,762 --> 01:06:41,320
Jump!

816
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:42,429
Come on!

817
01:06:42,531 --> 01:06:43,964
Jump!

818
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:45,801
Aah!

819
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:57,707
Aah!

820
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:15,330
Let's move out!

821
01:07:17,933 --> 01:07:19,332
Fuck!

822
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:22,002
Let's go!

823
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:52,411
Let's go back.

824
01:11:09,031 --> 01:11:10,623
Mother fucker!

825
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:29,783
Aah!

826
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:37,883
Frankie!

827
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:40,317
You got a Iot of expIaining to do, boy.

828
01:12:40,489 --> 01:12:41,581
I got to ditch this boat.

829
01:12:41,824 --> 01:12:43,587
Now get out of there.

830
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:44,987
Why? What's going on?

831
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,560
There's been a Iot of strange Iooking aircraft

832
01:12:47,796 --> 01:12:50,162
FIoating around here this aftern

833
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:52,191
What is she doing here?

834
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:53,767
She finaIIy reaIized

835
01:12:54,069 --> 01:12:56,367
Griffith ain't Mr cIean

836
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:58,072
Ok?

837
01:12:59,074 --> 01:13:00,939
We got enough prima donnas here.

838
01:13:02,177 --> 01:13:03,701
Like I say,

839
01:13:04,747 --> 01:13:07,215
You got a Iot of expIaining to do.

840
01:13:08,016 --> 01:13:09,677
Madame, you suite is ready.

841
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,626
This is it.

842
01:13:23,932 --> 01:13:26,059
Home sweet home.

843
01:13:26,201 --> 01:13:27,759
WeII, weII, weII.

844
01:13:30,205 --> 01:13:32,139
And it's a sweet picture.

845
01:13:32,307 --> 01:13:33,399
AIex,

846
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:34,906
I tried to caII you.

847
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:37,010
Somebody searched me at the office.

848
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:43,282
Ohh, don't stop there, bro.

849
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:45,509
I think she Iikes it.

850
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:46,986
AIex,

851
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:48,555
It's not what it seems.

852
01:13:48,857 --> 01:13:50,290
You shut up.

853
01:13:50,492 --> 01:13:51,390
AIex,

854
01:13:51,527 --> 01:13:52,721

860
01:14:07,643 --> 01:14:09,372
Mr CaIifornia.

861
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:12,342
Mr SiIk Underwear.

862
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:15,043
Mr Perfection.

863
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:18,385
You want to see how we chiII out in Hong Kong?

864
01:14:18,587 --> 01:14:20,111
You're drunk, AIex. Now, stop this.

865
01:14:20,589 --> 01:14:22,181
Aah!

866
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:31,493
Don't even think about it.

867
01:14:41,109 --> 01:14:43,270
I was waiting for that.

868
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:50,479
AIex.

869
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:52,186
Come on.

870
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:54,412
Come on!

871
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:55,918
AIex, He's your brother.

872
01:14:56,091 --> 01:14:56,989
Brother?

873
01:14:57,192 --> 01:14:58,090
Why?

874
01:14:58,227 --> 01:14:59,956
Because he Iooks Iike me?

875
01:15:00,529 --> 01:15:02,497
I'm going to change that.

876
01:15:03,298 --> 01:15:05,562
Because I'm gonna fuck up his face.

877
01:15:06,735 --> 01:15:07,667
Frank!

878
01:15:07,769 --> 01:15:09,327
Frank!

879
01:15:11,473 --> 01:15:13,031
You're not bad for a pussy.

880
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:26,586
Come on!

881
01:15:27,155 --> 01:15:28,383
Aah!

882
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:35,763
Heh Heh Heh.

883
01:15:36,732 --> 01:15:38,324
Aah!

884
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:55,948
Hey!

885
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:57,443

886
01:15:58,253 --> 01:15:59,686
Chad! AIex!

887
01:16:00,255 --> 01:16:02,280
Hey, Hey, You guys out of your mind?

888
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:06,159
Frank! Frank, stop them!

889
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:09,191
Aah!

890
01:16:16,171 --> 01:16:18,105
We're supposed to be fighting the Zhangs,

891
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,364
Not each other.

892
01:16:20,776 --> 01:16:22,641
Now you, AIex.

893
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:24,439
You need him more now

894
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:26,376
Than you ever have.

895
01:16:28,116 --> 01:16:30,107
You don't teII me what I need.

896
01:16:30,352 --> 01:16:31,785
You're drunk.

897
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:34,079
Maybe I'm drunk.

898
01:16:34,289 --> 01:16:35,779
Tomorrow I'II be sober,

899
01:16:36,391 --> 01:16:38,586
But he'II aIways be a faggot.

900
01:16:40,996 --> 01:16:42,793
That's it, Frank.

901
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:44,657
I don't need him.

902
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:45,960
I don't need him.

903
01:16:46,134 --> 01:16:48,295
I don't need the fucking tunneI.

904
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,268

01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:52,668
Fuck him!

906
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:55,265

01:16:57,346 --> 01:16:57,937
Fuck him.

909
01:16:58,046 --> 01:16:59,877
Chad!

910
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:05,616
What do you mean you're out of here?

911
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:06,685
Where are you going?

912
01:17:06,822 --> 01:17:09,120
I'm going home! Los AngeIes.

913
01:17:09,825 --> 01:17:10,985
We're on an isIand

914
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:11,991
On the other side

915
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:13,617
Of the fucking ocean!

916
01:17:14,563 --> 01:17:15,825
I'II swim!

917
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,232

919
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,598
Damn!

920
01:17:30,045 --> 01:17:32,878
AIex, he is you brother.

921
01:17:33,281 --> 01:17:35,078
Who was there for me

922
01:17:35,283 --> 01:17:36,978
When I was on the street aIone, Huh?

923
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:39,578
Nobody heIped me.

924
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:44,690
Nobody heIped me.

925
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:48,862
I don't have a brother.

926
01:17:49,698 --> 01:17:50,062
I don't have a brother!

927
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:44,708
Aah!

928
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:04,329
Aah!

929
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:05,838
No!

930
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:20,920
Oh, mother fucker.

931
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:51,851
Where are they?

932
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:56,390
Where are the twins?

933
01:19:56,858 --> 01:19:58,416
Fuck you.

934
01:19:59,261 --> 01:20:00,660
Stop! They've gone.

They couId take us somewhere eIse.

938
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:09,901
If you find them,

939
01:20:10,071 --> 01:20:12,232
Bring back their bodies.

940
01:20:12,607 --> 01:20:13,539
And I think Griffith

01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:23,895

I hope he'II taIk.

948
01:23:28,203 --> 01:23:29,761
He'II taIk.

949
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:32,836
Trust me.

950
01:23:37,712 --> 01:23:40,203
So we don't have the entire cabaI in custody.

951
01:23:40,382 --> 01:23:40,746
But we wiII before the day's over.

952
01:23:57,632 --> 01:23:59,259
Are they cooperating yet?

953
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:02,226
No. Sir.

954
01:24:11,379 --> 01:24:13,370
HeIIo, Frank.

955
01:24:21,289 --> 01:24:23,018
Are you ready to taIk...

956
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:25,851
Or are you ready to scream?

957
01:24:26,394 --> 01:24:28,225
Like I said....

958
01:24:28,396 --> 01:24:30,193
Fuck you.

959
01:24:35,437 --> 01:24:37,564
Aah!

960
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:58,223
Hey, where's your brother, huh?

961
01:24:59,527 --> 01:25:00,892
Where's you brother?

962
01:25:02,797 --> 01:25:05,027
He's Iate for the party, huh?

963
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:11,862
My brother hates parties, man.

964
01:25:12,674 --> 01:25:14,266
Aah!

965
01:25:36,397 --> 01:25:37,591
You don't know what side

966
01:25:37,732 --> 01:25:39,097
Your bread is buttered on, do you,

967
01:25:39,267 --> 01:25:40,791
You siIIy bitch?

968
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:42,527
You think. Aah!

969
01:25:42,704 --> 01:25:43,636
You fooIed us?

970
01:25:43,738 --> 01:25:44,670
AII the kindness

971
01:25:44,772 --> 01:25:46,740
I wasted on you over the years.

972
01:26:00,622 --> 01:26:02,055
Move.

973
01:26:08,396 --> 01:26:09,624
Go!

974
01:26:10,098 --> 01:26:11,497
Chad.

975
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:24,110
Zhang here.

976
01:26:24,245 --> 01:26:25,769
What the heII's going on up there?

977
01:26:25,947 --> 01:26:27,278
It's painfuIIy obvious, Raymond.

978
01:26:27,448 --> 01:26:29,109
WouId you pIease give me the phone?

979
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:33,844
This is NigeI Griffith speaking.

980
01:26:34,055 --> 01:26:35,750
Good evening, Iads,

981
01:26:38,259 --> 01:26:41,160
Not in a conversationaI mood, are we?

982
01:26:41,963 --> 01:26:43,123
Fuck you.

983
01:26:43,298 --> 01:26:45,732
WeII, perhaps a word or two from a friend

984
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:47,732
Might serve to break the ice.

985
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:49,692
Uhh!

986
01:26:49,837 --> 01:26:50,963
Uhh!

987
01:26:51,139 --> 01:26:53,073
Aah! Ooh!

988
01:26:53,341 --> 01:26:54,968
Kara, make him scream!

989
01:26:57,545 --> 01:26:59,877
Chad! In the boiIer room!

990
01:27:00,014 --> 01:27:01,606
In the boiIer room!

991
01:27:05,453 --> 01:27:06,385
They know where we are now.

992
01:27:06,621 --> 01:27:07,645
That's good.

993
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:08,787
We can stop wasting time.

994
01:27:08,957 --> 01:27:09,889
Ring the area with your men.

995
01:27:10,091 --> 01:27:11,490
Hurry!

996
01:27:16,497 --> 01:27:17,987
We're stiII waiting for you,

997
01:27:18,166 --> 01:27:19,155
Lads.

998
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:20,961
You know, it's not terribIy poIite

999
01:27:21,135 --> 01:27:22,124
To treat your friends this way.

1000
01:27:22,303 --> 01:27:23,235
If you don't hurry.

1001
01:27:23,338 --> 01:27:24,498
I'm afraid that one of them

1002
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:26,799
Might just have to depart our company.

1003
01:27:26,975 --> 01:27:29,068
Which one wouId you prefer it to be?

1004
01:27:29,644 --> 01:27:31,339
The young Iady?

1005
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:33,112
Aah!

1006
01:27:33,781 --> 01:27:35,373
No, No, No, No, No.

1007
01:27:37,151 --> 01:27:39,619
Mr Frank Avery.

1008
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:44,724
Don't faII for their trick, Chad!

1009
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:46,723
Don't faII for their trick!

1010
01:27:49,831 --> 01:27:52,231
No!

1011
01:27:57,639 --> 01:28:00,107
One down, one to go.

1012
01:28:00,241 --> 01:28:02,038
Do hurry, Iads.

1013
01:28:19,394 --> 01:28:21,021
Griffith.

1014
01:28:23,398 --> 01:28:25,229
You're dead!

1015
01:28:27,335 --> 01:28:29,360
You're dead!

1016
01:28:31,539 --> 01:28:33,097
They're on their way.

1017
01:28:33,741 --> 01:28:35,231
Good!

1018
01:28:39,247 --> 01:28:40,942
Oh, don't worry, Frank.

1019
01:28:41,783 --> 01:28:43,774
Next time we'II make it reaI.

1020
01:28:57,031 --> 01:28:57,963
Uuh!

1021
01:28:58,066 --> 01:28:59,556
Ah!

1022
01:28:59,734 --> 01:29:01,565
Aah!

1023
01:29:19,721 --> 01:29:20,779
Ah!

1024
01:29:29,797 --> 01:29:30,855
Ugh!

1025
01:30:35,062 --> 01:30:36,188
Ok!

1026
01:30:36,364 --> 01:30:38,229
Come on.

1027
01:30:41,702 --> 01:30:43,135
Shit.

1028
01:30:48,743 --> 01:30:50,210
Hyah!

1030
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:25,476
Come on!

01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:00,172
Hoo! Aah!

1032
01:32:00,681 --> 01:32:02,148
Heh Heh Heh.

1033
01:32:50,264 --> 01:32:51,492
Raah!

1034

01:33:56,464 --> 01:33:56,953
Cargo hoId number two, it's gone.

1039
01:33:57,064 --> 01:33:58,554
Cargo hoId number two, it's gone.

1040
01:33:58,733 --> 01:34:00,166
And everybody in it!

1041
01:34:00,267 --> 01:34:01,029
The twins.

1042
01:34:01,135 --> 01:34:02,329
What about the twins?

1043
01:34:02,436 --> 01:34:03,232
Everybody.

1044
01:34:03,337 --> 01:34:04,497
They're aII dead.

1045
01:34:05,039 --> 01:34:06,597
Goodbye, frank.

1046
01:34:07,808 --> 01:34:09,969
Uhh....ooh..

01:34:16,183 --> 01:34:17,480
Get away!

1049
01:34:18,352 --> 01:34:19,842
Uuh! Uhh!

1050
01:34:23,791 --> 01:34:25,383
Don't touch me!

1051
01:34:25,559 --> 01:34:26,992
No!

1052
01:34:30,831 --> 01:34:31,855
Come on. Luv.

1053
01:34:31,999 --> 01:34:33,694
This ain't going to hurt.

01:34:34,268 --> 01:34:35,257
No! Uhh!

1055
01:34:35,403 --> 01:34:36,768

Take care of Frank and DanieIIe.

01:36:17,671 --> 01:36:18,831
Yeah!

1072
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:51,062

Aah!

1085
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:21,241
Whoa!

01:41:32,252 --> 01:41:34,152
What's this reaIIy about anyway?

1096
01:41:34,555 --> 01:41:36,420
Is it the tunneI?

1097
01:41:39,726 --> 01:41:40,715
You know, AIex...

1098
01:41:40,894 --> 01:41:41,952
Griffith...

1099
01:41:42,096 --> 01:41:43,723
He's too weak.

1100
01:41:45,399 --> 01:41:47,128
Don't worry about Griffith.

1101
01:41:47,534 --> 01:41:48,796
My brother...

1102
01:41:49,103 --> 01:41:50,695
He's taking care of him.

1103
01:41:51,338 --> 01:41:52,270
Oh. heh.

1104
01:41:52,372 --> 01:41:53,839
Good.

AIex...

1106
01:41:55,576 --> 01:41:57,203
If you're in with me,

I'II give you haIf of everything.

1108

Everything.

1109
01:42:06,286 --> 01:42:08,584
What about my father?

1110
01:42:11,258 --> 01:42:12,885
Come on. Come on.

1111
01:42:13,060 --> 01:42:14,618
You've got to breathe, haven't you?

1112
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:21,690
