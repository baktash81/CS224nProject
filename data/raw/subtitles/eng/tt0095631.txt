1
00:01:01,246 --> 00:01:03,248
[shotgun blast]
Shit!

2
00:01:20,391 --> 00:01:21,768
[gunshot]

3
00:01:42,957 --> 00:01:44,959
[gunshot]

4
00:01:53,385 --> 00:01:54,978
[brakes screeching]

5
00:01:55,554 --> 00:01:57,477
Crazy-drivin' motherfucker.

6
00:01:58,265 --> 00:01:59,892
- Shit.
- Come on.

7
00:02:02,352 --> 00:02:05,152
Hey! Hey, Marvin,
what are you doin'?

8
00:02:05,356 --> 00:02:07,609
- He's mine, Jack. Get lost.
- Fuck you he's yours, he's mine.

9
00:02:07,817 --> 00:02:09,569
Eddie assigned this guy to me.
What the hell are you doing'?

10
00:02:09,777 --> 00:02:10,824
Well then go
straighten it out with Eddie.

11
00:02:10,987 --> 00:02:12,034
I'll collect the money.

12
00:02:12,238 --> 00:02:14,115
I almost got killed
tryin' to get this guy.

13
00:02:14,324 --> 00:02:16,122
- He shot at me...
- Back off, goddamn it!

14
00:02:16,326 --> 00:02:17,828
I said I'm takin' him, all right?

15
00:02:18,036 --> 00:02:19,914
- All right, Marvin.
- This guy's worth $1,200!

16
00:02:20,122 --> 00:02:20,873
Okay, okay Marvin.

17
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:22,799
What the hell are we fightin' for?
We're friends...

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,423
Nothin' personal, Jack,
but fuck off, all right?

19
00:02:25,628 --> 00:02:27,847
Take it easy. Jesus!

20
00:02:28,422 --> 00:02:29,844
Marvin, watch out!

21
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,395
What the fuck's goin' on?
You guys ain't cops.

22
00:02:33,637 --> 00:02:35,480
No, we're ballet dancers.

23
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,642
Didn't your mother ever teach you
how to react to strangers?

24
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,477
Not shoot at them? Huh?

25
00:02:55,117 --> 00:02:57,745
Hey, Marvin, thanks for the car.

26
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:01,125
You sleep,
and I'll bring it back a little later.

27
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:03,927
[engine starts]

28
00:03:23,356 --> 00:03:25,324
Got a delivery for you, Gooch.

29
00:03:25,734 --> 00:03:28,453
Jack. The soda machine's been out
for a week and a half.

30
00:03:30,823 --> 00:03:32,291
Check that for me, would ya?

31
00:03:32,783 --> 00:03:34,410
What do we got here?

32
00:03:35,786 --> 00:03:37,003
Alright.

33
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:40,716
- Give you any trouble?
- Did you give me any trouble?

34
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,007
- Fuck you, man!
- He didn't give me any trouble.

35
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:44,633
Fuck you, too, man!

36
00:03:44,838 --> 00:03:47,091
- Move!
- I know my motherfuckin' rights!

37
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:52,472
Slap it.

38
00:04:40,522 --> 00:04:42,650
Moscone's Bail Bonds.

39
00:04:45,027 --> 00:04:48,623
No, it's cash only.
No checks, no cards.

40
00:04:49,157 --> 00:04:53,754
I'm sorry, ma'am. That's the policy.
I wish I could help you out. Sorry.

41
00:04:57,207 --> 00:04:59,050
Just dropped off Bouchet. Is Eddie in?

42
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,470
So you finally caught someone, Jack.

43
00:05:01,712 --> 00:05:03,430
Jerry, is he in?

44
00:05:04,006 --> 00:05:05,633
I think that's terrific.

45
00:05:06,342 --> 00:05:08,310
Jack, I been tryin' to reach
you since last night.

46
00:05:08,511 --> 00:05:09,512
What do you got for me?

47
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,472
Been tryin' to reach me? It's Bouchet.

48
00:05:11,722 --> 00:05:13,600
Ooh, Bouchet. Good score, Jack.
$900, right?

49
00:05:13,809 --> 00:05:14,981
No, it's $1,200.

50
00:05:15,268 --> 00:05:18,238
- No, $900.
- That's, that's $1,200. Come on.

51
00:05:18,438 --> 00:05:20,236
No. Yeah, you're right.

52
00:05:21,983 --> 00:05:23,530
My stomach's killin' me.

53
00:05:23,735 --> 00:05:24,907
<i>I'm gain' over
to Chin Leo's for breakfast.</i>

54
00:05:25,111 --> 00:05:27,865
- I want to talk to you.
- About what?

55
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:31,494
- I'll talk to you over there.
- Could I have my money first?

56
00:05:32,495 --> 00:05:33,712
Of course.

57
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:35,631
What, do you think
I'm gonna try and stiff you?

58
00:05:35,832 --> 00:05:37,926
You? Never!
He would never try and stiff me.

59
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,547
Do I detect some kind of sarcasm here?

60
00:05:39,752 --> 00:05:40,675
Never.

61
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,847
Where have
I inherited this reputation?

62
00:05:43,048 --> 00:05:44,846
I have never done business
with anybody,

63
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,267
and Jerry is my witness...

64
00:05:46,468 --> 00:05:48,391
...that I have ever, ever, ever...

65
00:05:48,595 --> 00:05:49,437
Has that phone ever rang...

66
00:05:49,638 --> 00:05:52,232
Has that phone ever rang
with a complaint about me?

67
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:55,065
Never, never. So let's go.
I'll buy you some breakfast.

68
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,112
I don't eat breakfast.

69
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:57,898
Well then, have an early lunch.
Let's go.

70
00:06:01,776 --> 00:06:03,778
You ever hear of a guy
named Jonathan Mardukas?

71
00:06:03,987 --> 00:06:06,240
- The Duke. Yeah, I know who he is.
- What do you know?

72
00:06:06,447 --> 00:06:08,325
He's that accountant that
embezzled a couple of million

73
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,377
from some Vegas wise guy
and he gave it to charity.

74
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,420
That's very good.

75
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,874
Only thing is, that it wasn't a couple
of million. It was $15 million.

76
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,010
It wasn't some Vegas wise guy.
It was Jimmy Serrano.

77
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:21,264
I know, I know.
I can read the papers.

78
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:24,218
Look, I don't want to
bring up the past, but...

79
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,519
...isn't Serrano the guy
that ran you

80
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,893
out of Chicago when he
was runnin' things back there?

81
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,064
He didn't run me out.

82
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:33,018
Yeah, right right right. You gave
up bein' a cop to do this shit?

83
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,856
- Alright, what's the point?
- The point, Jack:

84
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:40,485
I bailed out the accountant.
I didn't know who he was at the time.

85
00:06:40,693 --> 00:06:43,572
I mean, had I known there was
no way I would've put up the bond.

86
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,122
I mean it's only a matter of time

87
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:47,577
before Serrano vanishes
this guy from the planet

88
00:06:47,743 --> 00:06:49,541
and I'm out $450,000.

89
00:06:49,745 --> 00:06:51,793
You're out $450,000 on this guy?

90
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:53,131
- No.
- No.

91
00:06:53,332 --> 00:06:55,426
No, because I got you,
and you're the best,

92
00:06:55,626 --> 00:06:57,799
and you're gonna find him
and bring him back.

93
00:06:58,003 --> 00:06:59,300
Yeah, right.

94
00:06:59,504 --> 00:07:01,428
How do you even know
this guy is still alive?

95
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:05,638
Because this guy is crazy.
He sends postcards to Serrano.

96
00:07:05,845 --> 00:07:08,439
He's tellin' him what a great time
he's havin' with his money.

97
00:07:09,515 --> 00:07:10,892
How much time you got left?

98
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:13,437
Friday, midnight, I default.
I eat the $450,000.

99
00:07:13,645 --> 00:07:15,648
This Friday? That's five days.

100
00:07:15,856 --> 00:07:18,029
Forget it. You go find him,
give me my money.

101
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:19,325
Jack, alright, look.
Listen to me.

102
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:22,120
I'll give you $40...
I'll give you $50,000.

103
00:07:22,321 --> 00:07:25,120
$50,000? I gotta chase you down
for $1,200. Forget about it.

104
00:07:25,324 --> 00:07:28,204
- No, no, no, no, Jack, please.
- Jack, nothing, forget about it. What else you got?

105
00:07:28,411 --> 00:07:29,788
I ain't got nothin', this is it.

106
00:07:29,996 --> 00:07:32,249
If you don't find this guy,
I'm out of business.

107
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,505
Eddie...

108
00:07:35,543 --> 00:07:37,216
I'll do it for $100,000.

109
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,764
$100,000? Are you out of your mind?
This is an easy gig.

110
00:07:39,965 --> 00:07:41,559
It's a midnight run for Christ sakes.

111
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,228
Maybe you haven't noticed,
but I'm tired of gettin' shot at.

112
00:07:44,428 --> 00:07:46,430
I'm tired of this
miserable fuckin' business,

113
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,982
every lowlife that I run into.

114
00:07:48,182 --> 00:07:50,230
If you're gonna pay me,
you gotta pay me what's right.

115
00:07:50,434 --> 00:07:52,857
You want me for this job,
give me what's right.

116
00:07:53,062 --> 00:07:54,986
First of all,
the guy is an accountant.

117
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,407
He's not gonna shoot you.

118
00:07:56,608 --> 00:07:59,327
All you have to do is find him.
You put him in a bag,

119
00:07:59,528 --> 00:08:01,030
hit him with a rubber hose,
bring him home.

120
00:08:01,238 --> 00:08:02,785
That's easy for you to say,
listen to me,

121
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,039
it's $100,000, no more, no less,
and I want a contract.

122
00:08:06,243 --> 00:08:08,838
- Contract?
- That's right, I want it in writing.

123
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:11,632
$100,000, and I'll have the Duke
here for you by Friday night.

124
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,881
Now, can I have my $1,200, please?

125
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,930
Man, you do worse than any crook
I ever put a bond up for.

126
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:31,478
Stanley?

127
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:33,446
Stan.

128
00:08:37,027 --> 00:08:39,200
Hey, Big Dog. How are you?

129
00:08:39,946 --> 00:08:41,414
What are you doin' here?

130
00:08:41,614 --> 00:08:43,116
Listen, I need a favor.

131
00:08:43,324 --> 00:08:46,077
I need to see the booking slip
of a Jonathan Mardukas.

132
00:08:46,286 --> 00:08:48,085
M-A-R-D-U-K-A-S.

133
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:50,087
There you go.

134
00:08:56,464 --> 00:08:58,933
- Yes, sir.
- What's that?

135
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,980
The number he called
right after he was arrested.

136
00:09:05,223 --> 00:09:06,941
212 area code.

137
00:09:07,601 --> 00:09:09,478
Looks like I'm goin' to New York.

138
00:09:16,903 --> 00:09:18,280
Are you Jack Walsh?

139
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:21,661
- Excuse me.
- Are you Jack Walsh?

140
00:09:21,866 --> 00:09:24,870
- I'm sorry, do I know you?
- Alonzo Mosely, FBI.

141
00:09:25,328 --> 00:09:28,081
That's a nice badge.
How can I get one of those?

142
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,507
I want to talk to you, Jack.

143
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,426
Yeah? Why don't you
call my social secretary?

144
00:09:31,627 --> 00:09:34,050
Yeah, very funny.
I want to talk to you.

145
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,465
Take your hands off me!

146
00:09:39,134 --> 00:09:40,260
Jeez.

147
00:09:40,427 --> 00:09:41,930
Take it easy!

148
00:09:44,974 --> 00:09:46,601
You know it's a $10 fine
for jaywalking in Los Angeles?

149
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:47,936
Shut up.

150
00:09:48,186 --> 00:09:49,312
What I want to know is

151
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:52,775
are you working on anything
having to do with Jonathan Mardukas?

152
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:55,365
Never heard of him.

153
00:09:55,569 --> 00:09:57,492
Well, I believe you have heard of him.

154
00:09:58,906 --> 00:10:00,453
Let me tell you something, asshole.

155
00:10:00,658 --> 00:10:02,410
We've been working on
this Jimmy Serrano thing

156
00:10:02,618 --> 00:10:04,336
for about six years.

157
00:10:04,578 --> 00:10:06,546
Mardukas is my shot.

158
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:08,963
I'm gonna bring him into federal court

159
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:11,044
and I don't want any
third rate rent-a-thug

160
00:10:11,253 --> 00:10:12,971
who couldn't cut it
as a cop in Chicago

161
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:16,095
bringing him to LA
on some bullshit local charge.

162
00:10:25,143 --> 00:10:26,986
Do I make myself understood?

163
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,147
Can I ask you something?

164
00:10:30,273 --> 00:10:32,446
These sunglasses, they're really nice.

165
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,902
Are they government issued

166
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,785
or do all you guys go to, like,
the same store to get them?

167
00:10:40,784 --> 00:10:42,627
Do I make myself understood?

168
00:10:42,828 --> 00:10:44,455
Can't you take a joke?

169
00:10:45,998 --> 00:10:47,420
Get him out of here.

170
00:10:49,127 --> 00:10:50,253
No, let's talk some more.

171
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:51,553
Get the fuck out of here.

172
00:10:51,754 --> 00:10:53,427
If I hear anything,
I'll let you know.

173
00:10:53,631 --> 00:10:55,349
Good-bye. Have a nice day.

174
00:10:59,345 --> 00:11:01,143
Think I could have my sunglasses back?

175
00:11:01,347 --> 00:11:02,315
Here's your sunglasses.

176
00:11:02,516 --> 00:11:04,268
[engine revs]

177
00:11:06,979 --> 00:11:10,199
Thanks. Thanks for this, too.

178
00:11:14,153 --> 00:11:15,997
"Alonzo Mosely."

179
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,367
Alonzo.

180
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,043
How's that?

181
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,763
Looks fine to me.

182
00:12:10,965 --> 00:12:12,717
Harold Longman, please.

183
00:12:14,677 --> 00:12:17,476
Harry? Jack Walsh.
How're you doin'?

184
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,775
You got that address check
on that phone number for me?

185
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,436
Uh-huh.

186
00:12:24,437 --> 00:12:28,567
Okay, thanks a lot, Harry.
Say hello to Julie for me. Okay, bye.

187
00:12:30,235 --> 00:12:31,987
Thank you.

188
00:12:34,823 --> 00:12:36,701
You Jack Walsh?

189
00:12:38,744 --> 00:12:40,872
- Who wants to know?
- That's a "Yes."

190
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:43,041
We'd really like to have
a word with you.

191
00:12:43,249 --> 00:12:46,469
- Yeah? What about?
- It involves big cash, lot of prizes.

192
00:12:46,752 --> 00:12:48,345
I'll make it short and sweet.

193
00:12:48,546 --> 00:12:51,141
The people I work for are really
interested in your visit here.

194
00:12:51,341 --> 00:12:52,809
Oh yeah? Who are the
people you work for?

195
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,388
An old friend of yours
from the Chicago days.

196
00:12:56,805 --> 00:12:57,977
You're here for the Duke.

197
00:12:58,181 --> 00:13:00,229
You think he's in New York,
and we think you're right.

198
00:13:00,434 --> 00:13:02,812
That's a nice jacket.
What is it, goatskin?

199
00:13:03,021 --> 00:13:05,820
Come on, Joey, please. Will you?
Never mind him.

200
00:13:06,524 --> 00:13:07,946
The way I hear it,

201
00:13:08,192 --> 00:13:10,820
you didn't cooperate
with my boss a few years back.

202
00:13:10,987 --> 00:13:12,239
Is that the way you heard it?

203
00:13:12,447 --> 00:13:14,449
Yeah, but I got a
news flash for you, Jack.

204
00:13:14,657 --> 00:13:16,000
He'd pay a hell of a lot more
for the Duke

205
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,503
than that putz bail bondsman
back in LA.

206
00:13:17,703 --> 00:13:20,502
- Oh yeah? How much more?
- How about a one with six zeros?

207
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,843
Are you gonna propose?

208
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,177
- Propose?
- Propose.

209
00:13:26,378 --> 00:13:27,755
'Cause if you're not,
quit starin' at me.

210
00:13:27,963 --> 00:13:29,135
- Okay?
- Starin' at you?

211
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,514
- You're staring at me.
- Joey, back off, will you please? C'mon.

212
00:13:31,718 --> 00:13:35,814
Mr. Walsh, your car's located
in space number 206.

213
00:13:36,014 --> 00:13:38,557
You can catch our shuttle bus
just through these doors.

214
00:13:38,558 --> 00:13:39,229
Thank you.

215
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,944
Here's my number, Jack.
Ask for Tony Darvo. That's me.

216
00:13:42,145 --> 00:13:43,989
They'll put you through
to wherever I am.

217
00:13:44,148 --> 00:13:46,697
And be good to
yourself this time. Okay?

218
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:52,161
Tell Jimmy I said hello.

00:14:25,025 --> 00:14:26,572
[phone ringing]

220
00:14:27,903 --> 00:14:30,031
- [Woman]: Hello?
- Hello? Mrs. Nelson?

221
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:31,206
<i>Yes</i> g

222
00:14:31,407 --> 00:14:33,000
Alonzo Mosely,
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

223
00:14:33,242 --> 00:14:35,916
- How are you this afternoon?
- I'm fine.

224
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,624
Let me get right to the
point if I may, Mrs. Nelson.

225
00:14:38,832 --> 00:14:41,301
An agent in our Los Angeles office
discovered a detail

226
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:43,253
that was somehow overlooked until now.

227
00:14:43,461 --> 00:14:45,509
It seems that when a
Jonathan Mardukas was arrested

228
00:14:45,713 --> 00:14:49,138
you were the first person he called.
Is that correct, Mrs. Nelson?

229
00:14:50,636 --> 00:14:52,889
- <i>Are you there, Mrs. Nelson?
- Yes.</i>

230
00:14:53,097 --> 00:14:55,475
Needless to say, this is a
matter of great concern to us,

231
00:14:55,683 --> 00:14:57,026
and if it would not
be too much trouble,

232
00:14:57,226 --> 00:14:58,227
we would like you to come down

233
00:14:58,436 --> 00:15:02,066
tomorrow morning to 26 Federal Plaza.
Do you think you could do that?

234
00:15:02,314 --> 00:15:04,363
- I suppose so.
- About 9:00 a.m.?

235
00:15:05,652 --> 00:15:08,531
- Yes.
- Just ask for Agent Alonzo Mosely.

236
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,408
Thanks for your cooperation.
Have a nice day.

00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,612
<i>They want to speak to me
about Jonathan.</i>

- [Jonathan]: Helen, what's going on?</i>

243
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,863
<i>[Helen]: Jonathan,
the FBI just called.</i>

244
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,036
<i>They know we spoke the night
you were arrested.</i>

245
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,490

Right now.</i>

- What is it, Jon?
- I don't know.

255
00:18:09,974 --> 00:18:12,069
Okay. Okay, Heidi. Okay.

256
00:18:13,312 --> 00:18:15,314
Alonzo Mosely, FBI!
You're under arrest!

257
00:18:15,522 --> 00:18:17,195
Get this fucking dog out of here!

258
00:18:17,399 --> 00:18:18,901
Get the dog out of here, ma'am!

259
00:18:19,109 --> 00:18:21,203
Not you. You stay there.
Get the dog, ma'am.

260
00:18:21,403 --> 00:18:22,655
- Do it, do it.
- Get the dog!

261
00:18:22,863 --> 00:18:24,615
Heidi. Come on, girl.
Come on, now.

262
00:18:24,823 --> 00:18:26,121
Good girl.
Come on, come on.

263
00:18:26,326 --> 00:18:28,795
Don't move or I'll shoot you
right through the glass.

264
00:18:34,918 --> 00:18:36,886
Get over here.
Put your hands up against the wall.

265
00:18:37,045 --> 00:18:39,890
Your hands up against the wall.
Spread your feet.

266
00:18:44,136 --> 00:18:46,230
Relax. There won't be a problem.

267
00:18:47,598 --> 00:18:49,771
Put your left hand behind your head.

268
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:52,062
Put your left... That's it.

269
00:19:03,865 --> 00:19:05,834
You're taking me to the airport,
aren't you?

270
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:11,837
You don't look
like an FBI agent to me.

271
00:19:13,292 --> 00:19:15,260
Yeah?
Well you don't look like a Duke to me.

272
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:17,179
If you're an FBI agent,

273
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,427
why don't you just take me
to the FBI office?

274
00:19:18,631 --> 00:19:22,603
If you don't be quiet, this is going
to be the worst trip of your life.

275
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,477
You work for Jimmy Serrano,
don't you?

276
00:19:25,681 --> 00:19:27,183
I don't work for that
piece of shit.

277
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:29,564
Your bail bondsman hired me
to bring you back to LA,

278
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:30,769
and that's what I'm doing.

279
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:32,897
- I got money, you know.
- I'm sure you do.

280
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:35,734
- I'll give you whatever you want.
- Start by shutting up.

281
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:38,786
I've known you all of two minutes,
and already I don't like you.

282
00:19:39,237 --> 00:19:41,490
Gee, that's too bad.
I really like you.

283
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:47,292
I can't keep you cuffed
on a commercial flight.

284
00:19:47,496 --> 00:19:49,123
I gotta check my gun with my luggage,

285
00:19:49,331 --> 00:19:51,959
but you fuck with me once
and I'm gonna break your neck.

286
00:19:52,168 --> 00:19:53,511
- I can't fly.
- What?

287
00:19:53,711 --> 00:19:56,715
- You heard me. I can't fly.
- No, no. You're gonna have to do better than that, pal.

288
00:19:56,922 --> 00:19:59,847
No, I don't have to do better than that,
because it's the truth. I can't fly.

289
00:20:00,051 --> 00:20:01,849
- I suffer from aviophobia.
- What does that mean?

290
00:20:02,053 --> 00:20:05,523
It means I can't fly. I also suffer
from acrophobia and claustrophobia.

291
00:20:05,724 --> 00:20:07,567
Well, I'll tell you what.
If you don't cooperate,

292
00:20:07,768 --> 00:20:09,520
you're gonna suffer
from "fistophobia."

Jack, what's the progress?

297
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,866
- I got him.
- You got who?

298
00:20:22,074 --> 00:20:23,371
The Duke. He's standing right here.

299
00:20:23,618 --> 00:20:25,495
You got him? Already?

300
00:20:25,745 --> 00:20:27,339
<i>Sure do. Want to say hello?</i>

301
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:29,792
Say hello to your bail bondsman,
Eddie Moscone.

302
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,126
Hello.

00:20:31,376 --> 00:20:33,504
There you go.

Jack, I love you!

305
00:20:35,088 --> 00:20:37,386
<i>What happened? How did this happen?
Where'd you find him?</i>

306
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:39,932
<i>[Jack]: I found him in New York.
We're at the airport.</i>

this is wonderful!</i>

<i>This is wonderful news!</i>

00:20:43,515 --> 00:20:45,142
<i>[Jack]: I'll be in your office
by midnight tonight</i>

310
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,522
<i>and I'm tellin' you right now, Eddie,</i>

311
00:20:46,726 --> 00:20:49,024
<i>I don't want to hear any bullshit.
I want the money tonight.</i>

312
00:20:49,229 --> 00:20:50,856
So go empty out
one of your Swiss bank accounts.

313
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:52,945
No, Jack, you don't have
to worry about nothin'.

314
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,402
This is the best money
I've ever spent.

315
00:20:54,652 --> 00:20:56,245
<i>Okay. See you in a few hours.</i>

316
00:20:56,445 --> 00:20:58,618
All right. I'll see you later.
'Night.

317
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:04,128
- So what's that all about?
- Jerry Walsh got the Duke!

318
00:21:04,954 --> 00:21:08,050
- Walsh got the Duke?
- He got him! He got the Duke!

This calls for a celebration.

found him so fast?

- Eating dinner. What do you want?

but I thought you'd like to know

327
00:21:43,704 --> 00:21:46,503
that Walsh found the Duke in New York.

found the accountant.

around midnight.

- Done.

00:22:27,335 --> 00:22:29,758
- Can I take your coat?
- That's fine. Thanks.

336
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:31,680
- May I take your coat?
- No.

337
00:22:33,132 --> 00:22:36,602
First class is nice.
I could make a habit out of this.

338
00:22:36,886 --> 00:22:38,980
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening to you.

339
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,559
Would either of you like a drink
before we take off?

340
00:22:41,767 --> 00:22:43,940
Yes, we would like
one of your finest champagnes.

341
00:22:44,102 --> 00:22:45,445
Certainly.

342
00:22:46,897 --> 00:22:49,491
Let's see. Look at this.

343
00:22:49,942 --> 00:22:53,162
Only in America. What a country. Huh?

344
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:56,408
Unbelievable.

345
00:22:56,741 --> 00:22:59,494
I think I'm gonna have the steak.
How about you?

346
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:01,580
I'm not hungry.

347
00:23:01,871 --> 00:23:03,464
Well why don't you
then get the lobster,

348
00:23:03,623 --> 00:23:06,092
because then I can get a little
surf and turf action going.

349
00:23:06,292 --> 00:23:09,467
I got a problem.
I can't fly.

350
00:23:09,672 --> 00:23:11,094
I don't think
you're takin' me seriously.

351
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,389
- I'm takin' you very seriously.
- I can't be on this plane.

352
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:16,470
You think I haven't
heard your story before?

353
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:19,023
Who do you think you're
traveling with, a fucking novice?

354
00:23:19,473 --> 00:23:21,317
Know what I'm talkin' about?

355
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:23,232
That's it. Settle in.

356
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:25,279
If you want to get up and talk
and be social and

357
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,777
mingle with the rest
of the passengers,

358
00:23:26,982 --> 00:23:29,030
be my guest.
You ain't goin' nowhere.

359
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:31,573
There's a couple
of nice-lookin' people here.

360
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:33,405
Better class of people.

361
00:23:33,947 --> 00:23:37,122
Your class.
Probably all embezzlers, too.

362
00:23:39,829 --> 00:23:44,300
[singing]
Come fly with me, come fly away...

363
00:23:50,716 --> 00:23:53,970
[engine starting]

364
00:23:54,302 --> 00:23:56,350
Why don't you just try and relax?

365
00:24:02,437 --> 00:24:03,780
Look, I...

366
00:24:04,105 --> 00:24:07,279
Just calm down.
Just relax and calm down.

367
00:24:08,484 --> 00:24:10,532
What are you
gettin' so excited about?

368
00:24:10,737 --> 00:24:12,364
It's not...

369
00:24:13,489 --> 00:24:16,164
No! I can't! I can't.

370
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:19,710
No, no, no!
I can't! I can't.

371
00:24:19,955 --> 00:24:21,878
Just relax! What did I tell you?

372
00:24:22,082 --> 00:24:26,087
- Now, don't pull that shit on me...
- No no no. I'm tellin' you, I can't do it.

373
00:24:26,295 --> 00:24:27,467
No, I can't!

374
00:24:27,671 --> 00:24:29,549
- These things go down!
- All right.

375
00:24:29,758 --> 00:24:33,854
These things go down! It's too big!
It's too big! It can't go up!

376
00:24:34,054 --> 00:24:36,227
[engines winding down]

377
00:24:37,891 --> 00:24:40,144
All right, everyone. Just calm down.

378
00:24:40,435 --> 00:24:43,030
- Alright, what's the problem?
- It's nothing, sir. It's okay.

379
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,278
Alonzo Mosely, FBI.
This man is in my custody.

380
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:46,359
I'm taking him
back to Los Angeles.

381
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:47,910
There won't be any more problems.

382
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,828
I don't want to fly.
I can't fly, really.

383
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:52,077
You can't take a prisoner aboard
an airplane if he doesn't want to fly.

384
00:24:52,281 --> 00:24:53,624
You should know that.

385
00:24:53,824 --> 00:24:56,829
I do. I'm sorry. I thought he was
bluffing. I thought he was bluffing.

386
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,999
I suggest you find some other mode
of transportation.

387
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:11,261
- What the fuck are you smilin' about?
- I love to travel by train.

388
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:14,143
Oh yeah? What do you think
this is, a class trip?

389
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:16,440
Are you always this angry?

390
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,559
Hey, look, right now
I'm in a great fucking mood.

391
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:20,520
You wait'll I'm cooped up
on that thing for a while

392
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:21,821
and you're not gonna be smilin'.

393
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:24,400
You're gonna be runnin'
for that fucking jail cell.

394
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:27,027
Still gonna make your schedule?

395
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:29,371
I'll make it, 14 hours to spare.

396
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:35,295
Oh, nice, nice. It's a double.
It's a double.

397
00:25:35,495 --> 00:25:37,714
- There'll be a lot of room.
- Glad you like it.

398
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:43,591
Thanks, 'cause they're starting
to cut into my wrists. Thank you.

399
00:25:43,795 --> 00:25:45,889
It just gets the skin after a while.

400
00:25:46,089 --> 00:25:48,718
- Get in there.
- What do you want? What?

401
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,058
Oh, come on. Come on.

402
00:25:52,555 --> 00:25:54,899
- Why would you do that?
- You enjoy yourself.

403
00:25:55,099 --> 00:25:57,397
This is my room, and that's your room.
Good night.

404
00:26:13,493 --> 00:26:17,294
- Hey, can I help you guys?
- Special Agent Mosely, FBI.

405
00:26:17,582 --> 00:26:19,459
Mosely? Are all you guys named Mosely?

406
00:26:19,667 --> 00:26:21,340
What the hell are you talking about?

407
00:26:21,544 --> 00:26:23,592
You're here to pick up a prisoner,
right?

408
00:26:23,796 --> 00:26:24,922
How did you know that?

409
00:26:25,131 --> 00:26:27,680
He was afraid to fly,
so he got off the plane.

410
00:26:27,884 --> 00:26:30,354
He left with an Agent Mosely.

411
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:33,978
Sir, that must mean that Walsh
has your identification.

412
00:26:38,687 --> 00:26:40,360
[phone ringing]

413
00:26:40,564 --> 00:26:41,281
Yeah?

414
00:26:41,481 --> 00:26:45,237
Is this Moron Number 1?
Put Moron Number 2 on the phone.

415
00:26:45,486 --> 00:26:47,705
Yeah, Jimmy.
He's, uh, right here. Hold on.

416
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:49,203
He's pissed.

417
00:26:51,826 --> 00:26:52,577
Yeah?

418
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:54,545
I thought you told me this guy
was gonna be on the plane.

419
00:26:54,871 --> 00:26:56,215
That's the information we got, Jimmy.

420
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:58,838
"That's the information we got."
I'm gonna tell you something,

421
00:26:59,043 --> 00:27:01,262
I want this guy taken out,
and I want him taken out fast.

422
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,763
<i>You and that other dummy better start</i>

423
00:27:02,963 --> 00:27:05,089
<i>getting more personally
involved in your work</i>

424
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,684
or I'm gonna stab you through the heart
with a fucking pencil, do you understand me?

425
00:27:08,052 --> 00:27:09,430
You got it, Jimmy.

426
00:27:15,185 --> 00:27:18,280
Tony.
He ain't mad at me, is he?

427
00:27:22,735 --> 00:27:24,533
<i>[JOB]: Jack?</i>

428
00:27:25,488 --> 00:27:28,082
<i>Jack, I think this is illegal.</i>

429
00:27:29,367 --> 00:27:33,088
<i>Jack, I don't think you can
keep a person in a bathroom like this.</i>

430
00:27:34,288 --> 00:27:37,509
- It's very claustrophobic in here...
- Yeah, it is?

431
00:27:37,709 --> 00:27:41,634
Well, I'll tell you what. When we get to LA, you
can tell the prison psychiatrist all about it.

432
00:27:41,838 --> 00:27:44,762
<i>There's no air.
There's no ventilation in here.</i>

433
00:27:44,925 --> 00:27:47,269
<i>I told you I was claustrophobic.
Come on.</i>

434
00:27:47,427 --> 00:27:49,020
<i>What do you think I'm gonna do?</i>

435
00:27:49,222 --> 00:27:51,441
<i>Jump off a train
moving 90 miles an hour?</i>

436
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,648
<i>Jack?</i>

437
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,568
<i>Jack?</i>

438
00:27:58,064 --> 00:27:59,907
<i>Jack?</i>

439
00:28:02,861 --> 00:28:05,205
Good. Thanks. Thanks.

440
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,333
Thanks a lot.

441
00:28:12,413 --> 00:28:14,165
- Good.
- Sit down.

442
00:28:14,498 --> 00:28:17,844
Yeah, that's great. Very kind of you.

443
00:28:22,674 --> 00:28:25,518
Nice, much better. Thank you. Good.

444
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:33,611
What are you doing?

445
00:28:34,103 --> 00:28:35,480
What am I doin'?

446
00:28:36,522 --> 00:28:38,445
- Arithmetic.
- Arithmetic?

447
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:41,198
Maybe I can help you.
I am an accountant.

448
00:28:41,485 --> 00:28:42,908
Well, you know what?

449
00:28:43,071 --> 00:28:45,369
I was thinkin', after I turn your
ass in and collect my money,

450
00:28:45,615 --> 00:28:47,617
I'm gonna open up
a nice little coffee shop.

451
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:50,420
How much exactly are you getting
for me, may I ask?

452
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,714
I don't think that's any
of your concern,

453
00:28:52,914 --> 00:28:54,757
but I'll tell you just to tell you.

454
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:58,296
- $100,000.
- $100,000?

455
00:28:58,629 --> 00:29:01,178
Does that mean you'd take $100,000
to let me go?

456
00:29:01,382 --> 00:29:02,884
Not by a long shot.

457
00:29:03,885 --> 00:29:04,932
$200,000?

458
00:29:05,136 --> 00:29:06,638
I never took a payoff in my life,

459
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:08,689
and I'm not gonna start
with someone like you.

460
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:11,815
- Why not?
- Because you're a fucking criminal,

461
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:14,272
and you deserve to go where you're goin',
and I'm gonna take you there.

462
00:29:14,521 --> 00:29:15,989
If I hear any more shit out of you

463
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,487
I'm gonna fucking
bust your head and

464
00:29:17,691 --> 00:29:19,409
I'm gonna put you back
in that fucking hole

465
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:21,783
and I'm gonna stick your head
in the fucking toilet bowl

466
00:29:21,987 --> 00:29:24,332
and I'm gonna make it stay there.

467
00:29:29,371 --> 00:29:30,668
I have to tell you,

468
00:29:30,872 --> 00:29:32,670
a restaurant is a very
tricky investment.

469
00:29:32,874 --> 00:29:35,627
More than half of them go under
within the first six months.

470
00:29:35,835 --> 00:29:36,803
If I were your accountant,

471
00:29:37,004 --> 00:29:38,722
I'd have to
strongly advise you against it.

472
00:29:38,923 --> 00:29:40,550
You would, huh? Well,
you're not my accountant.

473
00:29:40,758 --> 00:29:42,305
If I were your accountant...

474
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,057
I told you, I took you out here...

475
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,144
No, I'm just saying that
it's a very, very tricky business and

476
00:29:47,348 --> 00:29:48,770
if I were your accountant,

477
00:29:48,974 --> 00:29:51,774
I would really strongly have
to advise you against it,

478
00:29:51,978 --> 00:29:53,070
as an accountant.

479
00:29:53,271 --> 00:29:56,445
- You're not my accountant.
- I realize I'm not your accountant.

480
00:29:58,944 --> 00:30:00,821
I'm just saying
if I were your accountant...

481
00:30:05,576 --> 00:30:06,202
Jerry...

482
00:30:06,452 --> 00:30:08,705
How the hell could he
miss the goddamn plane?

483
00:30:08,913 --> 00:30:10,756
He called from the airport!

484
00:30:11,207 --> 00:30:15,678
Alright, alright. It's time to bring in Marvin,
alright? Call him up. He's in Pittsburgh.

485
00:30:15,878 --> 00:30:17,597
- Marvin Dorfler?
- Yeah, Dorfler.

486
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:20,347
Under "D" in the Rolodex
for "jerk," Jerry.

487
00:30:22,553 --> 00:30:24,476
Can I at least have some french fries?

488
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,479
I said no, pecker breath. Now shut up.

489
00:30:29,101 --> 00:30:31,480
[phone rings]

490
00:30:35,525 --> 00:30:36,401
Yeah, Dorfler.

491
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:39,453
Marvin?
Sweetheart, am I glad I got you!

492
00:30:39,821 --> 00:30:42,370
- Boy, do I have a job for you!
- Yeah? I'm listening.

493
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:45,249
First of all I gotta apologize,
because we were trying to find you

494
00:30:45,453 --> 00:30:47,956
and it's a very important job,
but I couldn't find you.

495
00:30:48,164 --> 00:30:50,838
So I had to give it to Walsh,
but now he's fucking it up...

496
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:52,759
I don't know why you
keep hiring that fucking guy.

497
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,137
<i>I know. I apologize. You are the best
at what you do. You know that? Now listen.</i>

498
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,808
Do you know who
Jonathan Mardukas is?

499
00:30:59,009 --> 00:31:01,432
- No.
- Jonathan Mardukas, the Duke?

500
00:31:01,636 --> 00:31:04,185
- Eddie, I never heard of him.
- Alright, listen. That's not important.

501
00:31:04,389 --> 00:31:07,393
What's important is that you find him
and you bring him back. Okay?

502
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:09,649
Now, last I heard,
he had him in New York,

503
00:31:09,853 --> 00:31:11,606
and now I don't know
where the hell they are.

504
00:31:11,814 --> 00:31:14,192
<i>But if you find him,
I'll give you what I'm givin' Walsh.</i>

505
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,027
Yeah, what's that?

506
00:31:16,944 --> 00:31:18,321
$25,000.

507
00:31:18,696 --> 00:31:20,448
<i>But you gotta have him
back by Friday, midnight.</i>

508
00:31:20,656 --> 00:31:21,623
<i>Otherwise the deal is off.</i>

509
00:31:21,824 --> 00:31:25,295
Yeah, well, don't worry, Eddie. For $25,000,
I'll bring him in on a silver platter.

510
00:31:25,496 --> 00:31:28,045
Bring him any way you want,
but bring him, okay?

511
00:31:28,248 --> 00:31:29,124
Bye.

512
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:33,712
Hey, scumbag.

513
00:31:33,921 --> 00:31:35,548
My name's Carmine, fucko.

514
00:31:35,756 --> 00:31:38,351
Yeah, well, Carmine,
today's your lucky day.

515
00:31:39,552 --> 00:31:42,226
Why is today my “Icky da,
<i>'</i> Shut up! y'

516
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,683
Yeah, yeah, my name
is Jack Walsh.

517
00:31:44,891 --> 00:31:47,064
Excuse me. John Wesley Walsh.

518
00:31:47,268 --> 00:31:49,362
Yeah, I think I lost my credit card.

519
00:31:49,562 --> 00:31:52,032
Can you tell me
the last place I used it?

520
00:31:53,734 --> 00:31:58,706
Yeah, 731-483-9521-13.

521
00:31:59,782 --> 00:32:02,376
The Amtrak office,
Grand Central Station?

522
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:06,168
Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah. I
remember that now.

523
00:32:06,373 --> 00:32:08,091
Yeah, okay, yeah.
Thanks very much.

524
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:10,009
Hey, uh...

525
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:12,258
Maybe we ought to cancel that card, huh?

526
00:32:12,921 --> 00:32:14,298
Yeah. Thank you.

527
00:32:30,898 --> 00:32:33,618
Familiar with the word
"arteriosclerosis"?

528
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:37,539
"Cholesterol"?

529
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:41,956
If you want, I'll outline
a complete balanced diet for you.

530
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,083
Mail it to me from C-Block.

531
00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:47,967
Why would you eat that?

532
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:49,635
Why? 'Cause it tastes good.

533
00:32:49,836 --> 00:32:51,964
- But it's not good for you.
- I'm aware of that.

534
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:54,970
Why would you do something,
if you know it's not good for you?

535
00:32:55,174 --> 00:32:56,551
Because I don't think about it.

536
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:58,182
That's living in denial.

537
00:32:58,387 --> 00:33:00,105
- Living in denial?
- Yeah.

538
00:33:01,724 --> 00:33:02,976
I'm aware of that.

539
00:33:03,142 --> 00:33:05,611
So you're aware of all your behavior
yet you continue to do things

540
00:33:05,811 --> 00:33:07,028
that aren't good for you.

541
00:33:07,229 --> 00:33:09,323
That sounds sort of foolish.
Don't you think so, Jack?

542
00:33:09,523 --> 00:33:12,949
No. Stealing $15 million
from Jimmy Serrano sounds foolish.

543
00:33:15,822 --> 00:33:17,495
I didn't think I'd get caught.

544
00:33:17,866 --> 00:33:19,334
Now, that's livin' in denial.

545
00:33:19,576 --> 00:33:20,873
I'm aware of that.

546
00:33:21,077 --> 00:33:22,670
So you're aware of your behavior

547
00:33:22,871 --> 00:33:25,796
and yet you continue to do things
that aren't good for you.

548
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,923
Sounds kind of foolish to me,
don't you think, Jon?

549
00:33:28,127 --> 00:33:29,049
It was foolish.

550
00:33:29,253 --> 00:33:32,302
But taking $15 million in mob money
and giving it to charity

551
00:33:32,506 --> 00:33:34,008
was good for a lot of people.

552
00:33:34,216 --> 00:33:35,559
So you pissed off a Mafioso killer

553
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,808
just to be loved
by a bunch of fuckin' strangers.

554
00:33:38,012 --> 00:33:39,139
That makes a lot of sense.

555
00:33:39,348 --> 00:33:41,066
Don't you want to be loved?

556
00:33:43,518 --> 00:33:45,065
Lots of people love me.

557
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,067
Really?

558
00:33:49,441 --> 00:33:50,943
Who?

559
00:33:51,568 --> 00:33:54,413
I got an ex-wife,
and I got a daughter in Chicago.

560
00:33:58,117 --> 00:34:00,586
How do they put up
with all your sarcasm?

561
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,589
Beautifully. I haven't seen either
of them in nine years.

562
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,543
Think maybe we should go see them?

563
00:34:05,751 --> 00:34:08,254
No, I don't think maybe
we should go see them.

564
00:34:08,462 --> 00:34:10,180
Thanks for the interest, though.

565
00:34:10,881 --> 00:34:12,428
The job must have been tough on them.

566
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,635
- I didn't do this then.
- What did you do?

567
00:34:14,843 --> 00:34:17,642
- I was a cop.
- You were a cop in Chicago?

568
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:21,693
Then you must know
all about Jimmy Serrano.

569
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,654
Do you have the right
to ask these sort of questions?

570
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,401
- Yeah, I think I do.
- No, you don't.

571
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:27,858
- I think I do.
- No, you don't.

572
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,067
Why not?

573
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,778
Dinner's over. Let's go.

574
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:37,869
I can see this is gonna
be some fuckin' trip.

575
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:41,672
I wouldn't worry about it, Jack.
I'm not gonna be with you that much longer.

576
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:43,044
What do you mean?

577
00:34:43,249 --> 00:34:44,421
With what I know about Serrano,

578
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:46,378
if I go to jail I'll be dead
within 24 hours,

579
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:49,723
so sooner or later,
I'm gonna have to give you the slip.

580
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:51,766
[chuckles]

581
00:34:53,176 --> 00:34:55,053
Glad you find it humorous.

582
00:34:58,098 --> 00:35:00,272
- Let's go.
- $2? That's all you're gonna leave?

583
00:35:00,476 --> 00:35:02,194
- That's 15 percent.
- That's 13 percent.

584
00:35:02,395 --> 00:35:04,818
These people depend
on tips for a living.

585
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:39,978
Can I help you, sir?

586
00:35:41,061 --> 00:35:43,814
Yeah, yeah, I'm lookin' for this
buddy of mine, Jack Walsh.

587
00:35:44,023 --> 00:35:46,276
He told me he'd meet me on this train.

588
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:50,496
Yeah, Mr. Walsh.
He's in Bedroom D, next car.

589
00:35:51,322 --> 00:35:53,826
- That next car?
- Yes, sir. That way.

590
00:35:54,034 --> 00:35:56,833
- Thanks.
- Sure thing. Have a good night.

591
00:36:38,081 --> 00:36:40,004
One word and you're dead, asshole.

592
00:36:43,294 --> 00:36:44,796
Shit! Son of a...

593
00:36:45,004 --> 00:36:46,803
[grunts]

594
00:36:48,801 --> 00:36:51,930
- How the fuck did you find out where I am?
- I ain't tellin' you shit!

595
00:36:52,137 --> 00:36:54,265
Marvin, you'll force me to do something
I don't want to!

596
00:36:54,473 --> 00:36:56,350
- What's going on here?
- Everything's under control.

597
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:59,403
Take it easy. Alonzo Mosely, FBI.

598
00:36:59,603 --> 00:37:00,947
Radio ahead.
I want the local police

599
00:37:01,147 --> 00:37:02,865
at the next stop to place
this man under arrest.

600
00:37:03,066 --> 00:37:05,410
- What the fuck are you talkin' about?
- That's enough out of you!

601
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,237
Go ahead.
Get on the horn and call the cops.

602
00:37:18,624 --> 00:37:19,876
Is this good news or bad news?

603
00:37:20,084 --> 00:37:21,336
Apparently Mardukas and Walsh

604
00:37:21,544 --> 00:37:23,342
are on the Amtrak
headed to Los Angeles.

605
00:37:23,546 --> 00:37:27,552
Another bounty hunter was arrested
after he tried to take Mardukas away.

606
00:37:27,801 --> 00:37:29,769
I want the jet ready in 20 minutes.

607
00:37:58,751 --> 00:38:01,721
- Where's Jack Walsh?
- He got off with the other guy...

608
00:38:01,921 --> 00:38:03,639
...two or three stops ago.

609
00:38:04,506 --> 00:38:06,133
His real name's Mosely.

610
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,098
I'm Mosely!

611
00:38:12,349 --> 00:38:15,944
I want to make a collect call
to Eddie Moscone from Jack Walsh.

612
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:22,323
- Moscone's Bail Bonds.
- Jerry, it's Jack. Put Eddie on.

613
00:38:22,652 --> 00:38:25,906
- Jesus, Jack! Where the hell have you been?
- Jack, I want to talk to him.

614
00:38:26,113 --> 00:38:26,955
Jack, where are you?

615
00:38:27,156 --> 00:38:28,783
Where am I?
Eddie, I want to ask you something.

616
00:38:28,991 --> 00:38:30,413
How come Dorfler wound up on my ass?

617
00:38:30,618 --> 00:38:32,461
Did you put him on this,
you son of a bitch?

618
00:38:32,662 --> 00:38:35,212
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Dorfler?
How could I put Dorfler on you?

619
00:38:35,415 --> 00:38:37,964
- I don't even know where the fuck you are.
- You had nothin' to do with it?

620
00:38:38,168 --> 00:38:39,841
Where are you?
You got the Duke or what?

621
00:38:40,045 --> 00:38:42,594
- You're damn right I got him.
- Where are you?

622
00:38:42,798 --> 00:38:46,302
<i>Where am I? I'm somewhere between...
I don't know. Toledo and Cleveland.</i>

623
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:48,184
- We're gettin' on a bus.
- Bingo.

624
00:38:48,805 --> 00:38:51,433
Bus? What're you gonna do... Jack, don't
get on a... What, are you out of your mind?

625
00:38:51,641 --> 00:38:53,985
Will you just shut up for a minute
and listen to me? We're gettin' on a bus.

626
00:38:54,185 --> 00:38:56,608
<i>I just wanted to let you know
we're on our way, okay?</i>

627
00:38:56,813 --> 00:38:58,531
Don't hang UP!

628
00:38:58,815 --> 00:39:01,820
Shit! What the hell is this guy doin'?

629
00:39:02,069 --> 00:39:03,241
I don't know.

630
00:39:05,572 --> 00:39:06,869
Listen...

631
00:39:07,074 --> 00:39:09,042
Maybe I ought to get some donuts
or something, huh?

632
00:39:24,175 --> 00:39:26,598
Two one-way tickets
to Los Angeles, please.

633
00:39:27,847 --> 00:39:29,190
Still gonna make our schedule?

634
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:31,518
Don't worry.
I'll get you there on time.

635
00:39:31,726 --> 00:39:33,069
Don't have any illusions.

636
00:39:33,436 --> 00:39:35,734
- Illusions?
- Illusions.

637
00:39:35,896 --> 00:39:37,318
Illusions.

638
00:39:37,523 --> 00:39:40,275
I'm sorry, sir.
This card's been canceled.

639
00:39:40,276 --> 00:39:42,325
Huh?
Has it been canceled?

640
00:39:42,571 --> 00:39:44,573
I'm sorry, that's a mistake.
Would you please try it again?

641
00:39:44,781 --> 00:39:47,079
- I checked it twice, sir.
- Please try it again.

642
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:48,786
Please try it again.

643
00:39:48,994 --> 00:39:50,712
- Did you pay the bill?
- Shut up.

644
00:39:50,912 --> 00:39:52,505
I'm sorry, sir. It's been canceled.

645
00:39:52,748 --> 00:39:56,253
Ma'am, that is impossible. I pay my bills.
There is no way that that could be canceled.

646
00:39:56,461 --> 00:39:58,304
- It's been canceled.
- Shut up!

647
00:39:58,504 --> 00:39:59,881
- Please.
- It's canceled, sir.

648
00:40:00,089 --> 00:40:03,059
- Would you like to try another credit card?
- I don't have any other credit cards.

649
00:40:03,259 --> 00:40:05,478
- Or cash.
- Please, would you just try that again?

650
00:40:05,678 --> 00:40:07,021
- No.
- All right.

651
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:10,442
Alonzo... Jack Walsh.

652
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:12,231
Federal Bureau of investigation.

653
00:40:12,436 --> 00:40:14,939
This is an official business.
I'm taking this man and he's in my custody.

654
00:40:15,147 --> 00:40:18,321
I'm taking him to Los Angeles, okay?
So please try this once more.

655
00:40:19,693 --> 00:40:22,322
Jack Walsh is not the name
on that badge, sir.

656
00:40:25,158 --> 00:40:27,331
Would you like me to call the FBI?

657
00:40:29,245 --> 00:40:31,088
Or would you like to pay cash?

658
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:37,426
- How much is it?
- $264 for two tickets.

659
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,052
$264.

660
00:40:39,256 --> 00:40:40,678
Here's $100.

661
00:40:46,347 --> 00:40:48,601
- Got any money on you?
- A lot.

662
00:40:55,732 --> 00:40:57,530
You call that a lot of money?

663
00:40:57,734 --> 00:40:59,828
It's enough to get you
where I'm gonna get you.

664
00:41:02,156 --> 00:41:06,206
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

665
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:08,833
Got the whole fuckin' force after me, huh?

666
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:09,877
[laughs]

667
00:41:26,056 --> 00:41:27,603
Who the fuck are you?

668
00:41:28,058 --> 00:41:29,982
Special Agent Mosely, FBI.

669
00:41:30,562 --> 00:41:32,405
Oh, goddamn it! I didn't do anything.

670
00:41:32,647 --> 00:41:35,025
Relax. Just want to ask you
a few questions, that's all.

671
00:41:35,233 --> 00:41:37,406
Yeah. Fucking A. Help yourself.

672
00:41:50,332 --> 00:41:52,676
So what do you know about Jack Walsh?

673
00:41:56,882 --> 00:41:59,886
Oh, no, no. Come on, come on.
Cigarettes are killers.

674
00:42:00,802 --> 00:42:01,724
So are women.

675
00:42:01,928 --> 00:42:05,182
Not the right woman. My wife
and I have a wonderful relationship.

676
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:06,482
She's stuck it out with me
through all of this.

677
00:42:06,641 --> 00:42:09,612
Stuck it out with you and
all your millions, what a trooper.

678
00:42:09,812 --> 00:42:12,986
I don't have millions, Jack.
I gave it all to charity, remember?

679
00:42:13,191 --> 00:42:15,487
You didn't keep
just a little for yourself, Jon?

680
00:42:15,488 --> 00:42:17,527
I kept enough to get away
and stay hidden.

681
00:42:17,528 --> 00:42:18,450
Yeah, right.

682
00:42:19,697 --> 00:42:22,372
You know, when we change buses in Chicago
you're gonna have a couple hours.

683
00:42:22,618 --> 00:42:23,835
I think you'd be a better man

684
00:42:24,036 --> 00:42:25,959
if you used that time to
look up your ex-wife and daughter.

685
00:42:26,163 --> 00:42:27,665
It's a perfect opportunity.

686
00:42:27,873 --> 00:42:30,046
Why don't you mind your own business?

687
00:42:34,588 --> 00:42:37,217
Let me ask you this: Why is it you
haven't seen them in nine years?

688
00:42:37,425 --> 00:42:38,677
- Why?
- Yeah.

689
00:42:38,885 --> 00:42:40,512
Just to get you off my back
I'll tell you why.

690
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,267
She married a police lieutenant

691
00:42:42,472 --> 00:42:44,474
and I'm not very popular
with the Chicago Police Department.

692
00:42:44,724 --> 00:42:47,443
- Why aren't you popular with them?
- That's a whole other...

693
00:42:47,644 --> 00:42:49,443
Do we know each other?

694
00:42:50,105 --> 00:42:51,482
- Why?
- Why?

695
00:42:52,316 --> 00:42:53,613
What did you do?

696
00:42:54,401 --> 00:42:56,449
Why aren't you popular
with the Chicago Police?

697
00:42:56,654 --> 00:42:58,907
That's something that
really doesn't concern you.

698
00:42:59,114 --> 00:43:01,617
- Did she hurt you, Jack?
- Yeah.

699
00:43:02,827 --> 00:43:05,250
- I'm sorry.
- What are you sorry about?

700
00:43:05,455 --> 00:43:07,708
- I'm sorry you're hurt.
- I'm not hurt.

701
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:10,131
- You just said you were hurt.
- I'm not hurt.

702
00:43:10,335 --> 00:43:12,884
- You just said you were hurt.
- I didn't say I was hurt. You said I was hurt.

703
00:43:13,088 --> 00:43:14,931
I asked you if you were hurt
and you said, "Yeah, I'm hurt."

704
00:43:15,131 --> 00:43:16,384
That's because you made me say it.

705
00:43:16,592 --> 00:43:18,060
You're startin'
to put words in my mouth.

706
00:43:18,261 --> 00:43:20,684
Jack, you're a grown man.
You have control over your own words.

707
00:43:20,888 --> 00:43:22,105
You're goddamn right I do.

708
00:43:22,265 --> 00:43:24,563
So here come two words for you:
Shut the fuck up!

709
00:43:28,312 --> 00:43:29,906
Excuse me.

710
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,201
Walsh called Moscone about
a half an hour ago

711
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,576
from outside Toledo.

712
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:38,203
He's on an interstate Coach Lines bus
headed for Chicago.

713
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,546
Come on.

714
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:47,421
Sir, what do we do with this guy?

715
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,049
Let him go.

716
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:57,311
Son of a bitch stole my cigarettes.

717
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:00,439
When's the last time
you had a chest X-ray?

718
00:44:03,183 --> 00:44:05,060
You know about secondary smoke?

719
00:44:05,269 --> 00:44:07,237
You could give people lung cancer

720
00:44:07,438 --> 00:44:10,443
who are innocent
and trying to live healthy lives.

721
00:44:10,775 --> 00:44:14,200
Why don't you just go back to sleep?
Leave me alone.

722
00:44:14,446 --> 00:44:16,824
- Do whatever you have to do.
- Put the cigarette out.

723
00:44:17,032 --> 00:44:18,955
Why don't you shut up
and leave me alone?

724
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:21,002
Put the cigarette out, Jack.

725
00:44:23,497 --> 00:44:25,340
Put the cigarette out.

726
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:28,089
What a pain in the ass this guy is.

727
00:44:28,544 --> 00:44:29,841
Thank you, thank you.

728
00:44:30,046 --> 00:44:33,550
- I thought you were putting it out.
- No, I'm not putting it out.

729
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:36,930
Why aren't you popular
with the Chicago Police Department?

730
00:44:38,972 --> 00:44:40,895
Sid's downstairs.

731
00:44:45,645 --> 00:44:47,818
- What's up?
- I think you and I should talk.

732
00:44:48,023 --> 00:44:49,776
Why are you hangin' around for?
Take a walk.

733
00:44:49,984 --> 00:44:51,657
I heard somebody picked up Mardukas
in New York.

734
00:44:51,819 --> 00:44:54,072
- It's old news, Sidney. I'm already on it.
- I don't have to tell you

735
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,657
<i>(what)“ happen if he becomes
a government witness.</i>

736
00:44:55,865 --> 00:44:57,242
I can assure you that
will not be the case.

737
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:59,623
I assumed you were
taking that position

738
00:44:59,827 --> 00:45:01,795
but I am supposed to advise you
against such action.

739
00:45:01,996 --> 00:45:03,499
Sidney, relax.
Have a cream soda.

740
00:45:03,707 --> 00:45:06,051
Everything is gonna be
all over within a few minutes.

741
00:45:40,162 --> 00:45:42,415
[sirens wailing]

742
00:45:48,296 --> 00:45:50,094
Who the fuck are these guys?

743
00:45:51,299 --> 00:45:52,846
Hands on the bus!

744
00:45:58,099 --> 00:45:59,726
All right, spread 'em.

745
00:46:06,023 --> 00:46:07,650
It's the fuckin' feds.

746
00:46:09,527 --> 00:46:11,121
Remember me?

747
00:46:13,115 --> 00:46:14,833
Agent Foster Grant.

748
00:46:15,033 --> 00:46:17,536
Alonzo, aren't you gonna thank me
for doin' your job for you?

749
00:46:19,913 --> 00:46:21,586
Thank you, Walsh.

750
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:23,588
[gunshots]

751
00:46:30,758 --> 00:46:32,135
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Come on!

752
00:46:49,195 --> 00:46:51,665
- What the hell are you doing?
- Keep moving.

753
00:46:52,282 --> 00:46:54,876
What? No, no!

754
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:04,387
Wait a minute. Jesus Christ!
All right, I'm comin'!

755
00:47:04,629 --> 00:47:07,508
- Come on!
- All right! Wait a minute!

756
00:47:09,592 --> 00:47:12,516
Walsh, you son of a bitch!

757
00:47:22,022 --> 00:47:23,695
- My God, my God!
- Shut up.

758
00:47:23,899 --> 00:47:25,276
- What the hell was that?
- Shut up.

759
00:47:25,484 --> 00:47:27,907
- Why were they shooting?
- Those are Serrano's people back there.

760
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:30,034
They're not even waiting
for you to get to jail.

761
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:32,834
You're turnin' me in.
Why are we runnin' away from the FBI?

762
00:47:33,034 --> 00:47:35,708
'Cause I gotta bring you back myself,
otherwise I won't get my money.

763
00:47:35,912 --> 00:47:37,209
I won't give you to the feds.

764
00:47:39,249 --> 00:47:41,843
"Alonzo Mosely."
Isn't that the name you've been using?

765
00:47:42,043 --> 00:47:43,465
Let me see that.

766
00:47:46,549 --> 00:47:48,517
- Look at this wealth of information.
- What?

767
00:47:48,717 --> 00:47:50,890
They got a tap on Moscone's line.

768
00:47:52,805 --> 00:47:54,227
Son of a bitch!

769
00:47:56,141 --> 00:47:58,816
What are you doin'?
What are you doin'?

770
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,450
How far do you think we're
gonna get in a stolen FBI car?

771
00:48:06,152 --> 00:48:07,324
What's that for?

772
00:48:07,529 --> 00:48:09,748
An inside joke between me and Alonzo.

773
00:48:10,615 --> 00:48:13,165
- Tony Darvo, line one.
- Yeah?

774
00:48:13,369 --> 00:48:15,246
Sorry, Jimmy. It didn't happen.

775
00:48:16,289 --> 00:48:18,087
It didn't happen?
Say that again, Tony?

776
00:48:18,291 --> 00:48:19,292
<i>It just didn't happen.</i>

777
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,047
I mean, there were cops all over the place.

778
00:48:21,252 --> 00:48:23,050
There were a million
fuckin' feds all over.

779
00:48:23,212 --> 00:48:25,056
Jimmy, it was... it was a mess.

780
00:48:25,215 --> 00:48:27,183
- It was a real mess.
- You'd better get off the line, Jimmy.

781
00:48:27,426 --> 00:48:31,021
- If they've got a tap on that line...
- Sidney, shut your fucking mouth!

782
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:33,523
Now listen to me, dummy.

783
00:48:33,724 --> 00:48:36,225
Do they have Mardukas
in custody or not?

784
00:48:36,226 --> 00:48:37,193
I don't, I don't, I don't know.

785
00:48:37,394 --> 00:48:39,523
Jimmy, I don't know. The cops
are swarming all over the place.

786
00:48:39,772 --> 00:48:41,024
<i>We couldn't see anything.</i>

787
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:43,192
Let me tell you two stupid
motherfuckers something.

788
00:48:43,401 --> 00:48:45,904
I don't want to get another
phone call like this, because

789
00:48:46,112 --> 00:48:49,241
if I do I'll get on a fuckin' plane,
and I'm gonna blowtorch the both of you.

790
00:48:49,449 --> 00:48:50,871
Do you understand?

791
00:48:51,327 --> 00:48:52,829
Are you gonna stop? I'm on the phone!

792
00:48:53,037 --> 00:48:54,414
I'm talking to Jimmy.
What are you doin'?

793
00:48:54,955 --> 00:48:57,504
I should've killed Walsh
in Chicago a long time ago.

794
00:48:57,875 --> 00:49:00,469
Don't say a word to me, Sidney.
Don't say a fuckin' word to me.

795
00:49:00,669 --> 00:49:03,263
I'll get up and I'll bury
this telephone in your head.

796
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:30,034
I can't believe this.

797
00:49:30,242 --> 00:49:33,417
I haven't seen either of them in nine years
and the first thing outta my mouth is gonna be:

798
00:49:33,622 --> 00:49:35,624
"Can I borrow a few hundred bucks?"

799
00:49:35,832 --> 00:49:38,802
I have a feeling this is going
to be very good for you.

800
00:49:46,302 --> 00:49:48,145
[bell rings]

801
00:49:51,683 --> 00:49:53,526
You look fine.

802
00:49:57,939 --> 00:49:59,362
<i>Who are you Ql-“ls?</i>

803
00:50:00,234 --> 00:50:02,236
I'm your mother's ex-husband.

804
00:50:04,279 --> 00:50:07,499
- Mom!
- Nice kid.

805
00:50:17,544 --> 00:50:18,841
Hi, Gail.

806
00:50:19,421 --> 00:50:21,264
- Hello.
- How're you doin'?

807
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,217
I'm doin' good.

808
00:50:27,847 --> 00:50:28,814
Hi.

809
00:50:29,932 --> 00:50:31,900
They mentioned you and him
on the news this morning.

810
00:50:32,101 --> 00:50:33,478
- They did?
- Yeah.

811
00:50:34,645 --> 00:50:36,568
What did they say? Anything good?

812
00:50:36,772 --> 00:50:38,490
[chuckles]

813
00:50:38,649 --> 00:50:41,529
No. Are you all right?

814
00:50:42,237 --> 00:50:43,534
Yeah.

815
00:50:44,823 --> 00:50:46,996
You're in a lot of trouble, Jack.

816
00:50:48,785 --> 00:50:51,083
Can I come in for a few minutes, Gail?

817
00:50:53,207 --> 00:50:55,255
Can I come in for a few minutes?

818
00:50:56,794 --> 00:50:58,546
Yeah.

819
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:02,307
I won't stay long.

820
00:51:02,508 --> 00:51:05,057
I just need to borrow
some money to get to LA.

821
00:51:05,596 --> 00:51:07,223
You know I'm good for it.

822
00:51:08,015 --> 00:51:10,734
Jack, I don't think I have
that kind of cash in the house.

823
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:14,780
I'm so embarrassed.
I'm just in a jam, Gail.

824
00:51:16,982 --> 00:51:18,529
You look beautiful.

825
00:51:19,486 --> 00:51:21,409
You don't look much like a criminal.

826
00:51:21,613 --> 00:51:22,830
I'm a white-collar criminal.

827
00:51:23,031 --> 00:51:24,658
Jason, go upstairs now.

828
00:51:28,453 --> 00:51:29,955
Jack, you shouldn't be here.

829
00:51:30,246 --> 00:51:32,921
If Ted comes home,
he's gonna arrest you and him.

830
00:51:33,125 --> 00:51:34,968
- Arrest us?
- Yeah.

831
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:39,390
Then we'd really be in a lot of trouble 'cause
I'm afraid I'm a little short of bribe money.

832
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:42,093
All right, Jack, don't start.
Please, don't.

833
00:51:42,301 --> 00:51:44,429
How is Lieutenant
whatever-his-name-is?

834
00:51:44,637 --> 00:51:47,266
- It's captain now.
- Captain? Royalty.

835
00:51:47,474 --> 00:51:50,068
Jack, I don't want any trouble.
Do you understand that?

836
00:51:50,268 --> 00:51:52,771
Please, it is not a good day for this.
I mean it.

837
00:51:52,979 --> 00:51:54,401
I'm sorry that my fugitive timetable

838
00:51:54,606 --> 00:51:56,608
doesn't coincide
with your social calendar.

839
00:51:56,817 --> 00:51:58,945
- I don't think she was saying that.
- Stay out of this, Jon.

840
00:51:59,152 --> 00:51:59,824
Alright, same old Jack,

841
00:52:00,029 --> 00:52:03,156
you get your feelings hurt and then you
just walk around and hurt everybody else.

842
00:52:03,157 --> 00:52:04,452
The last thing I need
now is one of your lectures!

843
00:52:04,453 --> 00:52:06,168
I'm not lecturing you, stupid!
I'm trying to protect you!

844
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:08,538
- Come on!
- Ted is gonna be home any minute.

845
00:52:08,746 --> 00:52:10,589
We're all going out.
It's an important night for us.

846
00:52:11,082 --> 00:52:13,006
Important night? What's so important
about tonight? Wait, let me guess.

847
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:15,759
- What is it, payoff night?
- Alright, that's it! Get out!

848
00:52:15,963 --> 00:52:19,131
- Let's not fight.
- Gail, listen! I'm in a big fuckin' jam!

849
00:52:19,132 --> 00:52:21,260
I just need to borrow some money
so I can get this guy back to LA

850
00:52:21,468 --> 00:52:23,220
and I'm out of this
miserable fucking business forever!

851
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:25,222
Can't you understand that?

852
00:52:43,492 --> 00:52:44,664
Hi.

853
00:52:47,621 --> 00:52:49,123
Denise?

854
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,635
You got so big.

855
00:53:12,315 --> 00:53:15,159
- I'm sorry. I'm gonna go now. I'm sorry.
- No, hold on.

856
00:53:21,742 --> 00:53:24,871
I'm sorry, honey.
It's just, we're havin' a...

857
00:53:33,253 --> 00:53:34,972
What grade are you in now?

858
00:53:35,131 --> 00:53:36,098
Eighth.

859
00:53:36,299 --> 00:53:38,097
Are you in the eighth grade?

860
00:53:58,948 --> 00:54:02,670
Here's $40. That's all I've got,
but these are the keys to my car.

861
00:54:02,869 --> 00:54:04,542
It's the station wagon
in the driveway.

862
00:54:04,746 --> 00:54:07,249
- I'll tell Ted that it's in the shop.
- Okay.

863
00:54:07,499 --> 00:54:10,378
And we'll worry about it
when you get back to LA.

864
00:54:11,503 --> 00:54:13,551
So, does he take good care of you?

865
00:54:16,801 --> 00:54:19,224
Yeah?
Well, that's all I wanted to know.

866
00:54:20,638 --> 00:54:22,732
So what's he gonna say about this?

867
00:54:23,975 --> 00:54:27,571
- He'll understand.
- Yeah, that's love, y'know?

868
00:54:29,189 --> 00:54:30,816
Bye, honey.

869
00:55:08,523 --> 00:55:09,866
Wait.

870
00:55:10,692 --> 00:55:13,161
It isn't much.
About $180 babysitting money.

871
00:55:13,361 --> 00:55:15,409
- Sweetheart, I can't.
- Take it.

872
00:55:15,613 --> 00:55:17,786
- I can't.
- Please.

873
00:55:19,325 --> 00:55:21,545
- Take it.
- I can't, sweetheart.

874
00:55:55,490 --> 00:55:59,791
Hello. I'd like to make a collect call
to an Eddie Moscone from a Jack Walsh.

875
00:56:00,203 --> 00:56:03,003
[phone rings]

876
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:04,667
Moscone's Bail Bonds.

877
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:06,422
Jerry, Jack, put Eddie on the phone.

878
00:56:06,794 --> 00:56:08,171
Eddie, it's Jack.

879
00:56:08,712 --> 00:56:10,635
Jack, stop fuckin' around.
Where are you?

880
00:56:10,839 --> 00:56:13,262
Where am I? I'm in Boise, Idaho.

881
00:56:13,592 --> 00:56:15,812
No, no, no, wait a minute.
I'm in Anchorage, Alaska.

882
00:56:16,054 --> 00:56:18,273
No, no, no, wait.
I'm in Casper, Wyoming.

883
00:56:18,515 --> 00:56:21,860
I'm in the lobby of a Howard Johnson's
and I'm wearing a pink carnation.

884
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:23,903
What the fuck
are you talkin' about?

885
00:56:24,104 --> 00:56:26,402
I'm not talkin' to you.
I'm talkin' to the other guys.

886
00:56:26,648 --> 00:56:27,774
What other guys?

887
00:56:27,983 --> 00:56:30,657
Let me describe the scene to you.
There's these guys, see.

888
00:56:30,861 --> 00:56:32,534
They've probably been up
for like two days.

889
00:56:32,738 --> 00:56:34,957
They stink of B.0.
They have coffee breath.

890
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:38,078
They're constipated from sitting
on their asses for so long.

891
00:56:38,327 --> 00:56:40,329
They're sitting in a van
and they're probably parked

892
00:56:40,538 --> 00:56:41,961
right up the street
from your office.

893
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:45,044
But now, you guys, you're gonna
have to pack up all your shit and go home,

894
00:56:45,252 --> 00:56:47,721
<i>because I'm onto you, you dumb fucks.</i>

895
00:56:47,921 --> 00:56:49,343
<i>Eddie, your phone is tapped.</i>

896
00:56:49,506 --> 00:56:52,510
<i>Listen, I'm not going to use
this line anymore. Go to Chin Loo 's.</i>

897
00:56:52,717 --> 00:56:55,597
I'll call you there in five minutes.
They can't run a tap that fast.

898
00:56:55,805 --> 00:56:57,227
So long, everybody.

899
00:56:57,932 --> 00:57:00,151
[phone rings]

900
00:57:00,685 --> 00:57:04,280
Excuse me, buddy. I got it, I got it, I got
it! I think it's for me. Jack, that you?

901
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,858
Listen, I need you to wire me $500
to the Western Union office

902
00:57:07,108 --> 00:57:08,577
in Amarillo, Texas right away.

903
00:57:08,777 --> 00:57:11,075
Wait a minute. What do you
need with $500 on a bus?

904
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,203
And why the fuck
aren't you on a plane?

905
00:57:13,407 --> 00:57:15,501
Did it ever occur to you
that I am a professional

906
00:57:15,659 --> 00:57:16,581
and that I might have my reasons?

907
00:57:16,827 --> 00:57:19,956
We are driving now, and I only have
enough cash to get to Amarillo.

908
00:57:20,164 --> 00:57:21,507
We had to scrap the bus.

909
00:57:21,708 --> 00:57:24,336
Fuck the bus! I wanna know
what happened to the goddamn plane!

910
00:57:25,837 --> 00:57:28,966
- He doesn't like to fly.
- He doesn't like to fly?

911
00:57:29,174 --> 00:57:31,643
What the fuck does that mean?
Listen to me, Jack!

912
00:57:31,843 --> 00:57:34,687
You gotta be back here in less
than two and a half fucking days.

913
00:57:34,888 --> 00:57:38,768
A half million dollars of my money!
What the fuck is goin' on there?

914
00:57:38,769 --> 00:57:42,317
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, I swear to God,
don't start with me now or I will shoot him

915
00:57:42,563 --> 00:57:45,032
and I will dump him
in a fuckin' swamp!

916
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:47,572
I am in no fuckin' mood for this.

917
00:57:47,776 --> 00:57:50,155
Just send me the money and
I'll have him back by the deadline.

918
00:57:50,363 --> 00:57:52,240
- You hear me?
- Yes.

919
00:57:53,241 --> 00:57:54,709
Let's go.

920
00:57:56,995 --> 00:58:00,920
Jerry, wire $500 to Jack Walsh
in Amarillo, Texas right away.

921
00:58:01,124 --> 00:58:03,253
Amarillo, Texas. Now, listen.

922
00:58:03,628 --> 00:58:06,928
Also, get Dorfler down there!
Find him and get him down there, too.

923
00:58:07,256 --> 00:58:09,258
- You got it, Eddie.
- Shit!

924
00:58:09,467 --> 00:58:11,265
[door slams]

925
00:58:11,761 --> 00:58:14,389
<i>[Jon singing] If one of those bottles
of beer should fall,</i>

926
00:58:14,597 --> 00:58:17,772
<i>96 bottles of beer on the wall.</i>

927
00:58:17,976 --> 00:58:20,855
<i>96 bottles of beer on the wall,</i>

928
00:58:21,063 --> 00:58:26,035
Ba-ba-boom.
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-boom.

929
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,158
Nine...

930
00:58:30,865 --> 00:58:35,462
93 bottles of beer on the wall.

931
00:58:38,039 --> 00:58:41,464
Why were you so unpopular
with the Chicago Police Department?

932
00:58:42,336 --> 00:58:44,134
'Cause of your personality?

933
00:58:46,674 --> 00:58:49,974
What happened back at your house?
What was that all about?

934
00:58:50,427 --> 00:58:53,021
Your wife married
a corrupt police officer?

935
00:58:56,351 --> 00:58:57,898
What was it all about?

936
00:59:00,855 --> 00:59:03,028
That whole fuckin' department
was corrupt.

937
00:59:03,275 --> 00:59:05,277
There's good and bad everywhere,
don't you think?

938
00:59:05,485 --> 00:59:08,739
I'd say there's bad everywhere.
Good I don't know about.

939
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:14,003
What happened to you?

940
00:59:18,916 --> 00:59:20,839
I wouldn't go on the payroll.

941
00:59:22,421 --> 00:59:23,968
What payroll?

942
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:27,308
I was workin' undercover.

943
00:59:27,509 --> 00:59:31,810
I was close to this guy,
this big heroin dealer in Chicago.

944
00:59:32,055 --> 00:59:34,183
He supplied the whole city.

945
00:59:34,975 --> 00:59:37,525
Took me a year just
to get his confidence.

946
00:59:38,313 --> 00:59:42,238
Just when I was about to nail the son
of a bitch my fellow officers

947
00:59:42,483 --> 00:59:46,158
mysteriously discovered seven pounds
of heroin in my house.

948
00:59:46,654 --> 00:59:49,750
So this big-time drug dealer
gave me a choice:

949
00:59:49,992 --> 00:59:52,165
Get on the payroll
like everybody else,

950
00:59:52,369 --> 00:59:54,963
get out of town,
or go to jail for 30 years.

951
00:59:55,998 --> 00:59:57,841
Well, I didn't get on the payroll.

952
00:59:58,417 --> 01:00:00,044
And that's why I do this.

953
01:00:01,003 --> 01:00:03,678
When I find a criminal like you,
I bring him in.

954
01:00:03,882 --> 01:00:06,385
I don't have to worry
about anybody takin' a payoff

955
01:00:06,593 --> 01:00:08,812
because there is no anybody.
There's just me.

956
01:00:18,356 --> 01:00:20,734
Why don't you
get yourself a new watch?

957
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:22,944
I'll tell you when I know you better.

958
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:25,826
When you know me better? When will you get to
know me better? I'll get to know you better.

959
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:28,374
- You're not gonna get to know me better.
- Will you shut up?

960
01:00:28,574 --> 01:00:29,952
That's what I mean.

961
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,734
How much money do we have left?

962
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,232
- That's it?
- That's it.

963
01:00:59,817 --> 01:01:01,945
We're starvin',
and you're buying cigarettes?

964
01:01:02,152 --> 01:01:03,495
I need these cigarettes.

965
01:01:03,695 --> 01:01:06,244
You can have your whatever
you're gonna have, I'll have this.

966
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:08,208
What can I do for you boys?

967
01:01:08,409 --> 01:01:09,535
Coffee, please.

968
01:01:13,581 --> 01:01:16,004
- How much is the coffee?
- It's 53 cents.

969
01:01:16,251 --> 01:01:18,674
- How much is tea?
- 53 cents.

970
01:01:22,132 --> 01:01:23,555
I'll have tea.

971
01:01:23,801 --> 01:01:26,429
Our breakfast special today
is chorizo and eggs.

972
01:01:26,637 --> 01:01:28,981
- Chorizo and eggs?
- Chorizo and eggs. Yes.

973
01:01:29,223 --> 01:01:31,317
- What is that?
- It's a Mexican sausage

974
01:01:31,517 --> 01:01:34,521
mixed in with scrambled eggs.
It comes with hash browns and toast.

975
01:01:34,728 --> 01:01:36,902
We won't be havin' that. Thank you.

976
01:01:42,946 --> 01:01:44,368
What time you got?

977
01:01:46,741 --> 01:01:47,663
Ten to nine.

978
01:01:47,868 --> 01:01:50,839
Alright, in 10 minutes we'll be at the
Western Union office, we'll have $500,

979
01:01:50,997 --> 01:01:54,171
and I'll buy you a nice juicy steak
or whatever you want, okay?

980
01:01:55,251 --> 01:01:58,128
- Chorizo and eggs?
- Huh?

981
01:01:58,129 --> 01:02:00,678
- Chorizo and eggs?
- I'll get you whatever you want.

982
01:02:04,553 --> 01:02:05,395
You know, Jon,

983
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:08,099
you're in this mess
because you're in this mess.

984
01:02:08,265 --> 01:02:09,858
I didn't put you in this mess.

985
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,522
Do you understand?

986
01:02:11,727 --> 01:02:13,024
Yeah.

987
01:02:13,228 --> 01:02:16,858
If you had left Jimmy Serrano alone,
this wouldn't be happening.

988
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:21,199
Thank you.

989
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:23,698
Thank you.

990
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:25,913
I had a way out of this, you know.

991
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:28,373
Oh, yeah 7?

992
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:31,336
What's the thing
Serrano's most afraid of?

993
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:36,549
<i>Gain' cross-country with you.</i>

994
01:02:40,883 --> 01:02:43,227
Gettin' knocked off by his own people.

995
01:02:44,429 --> 01:02:46,773
What I know about
his financial transactions

996
01:02:46,973 --> 01:02:50,227
could not only put him away but
every mob guy he ever did business with.

997
01:02:50,477 --> 01:02:52,525
That's why he wants to kill me.

998
01:02:52,938 --> 01:02:55,862
I was gonna put all his records
on computer disks.

999
01:02:56,149 --> 01:02:59,154
I figured if things got too rough
I could always trade them for my life.

1000
01:02:59,362 --> 01:03:00,284
So what happened?

1001
01:03:00,488 --> 01:03:03,958
What happened was I got arrested
before I had a chance to do it.

1002
01:03:04,492 --> 01:03:06,711
Why didn't you just leave him alone?

1003
01:03:07,453 --> 01:03:10,457
You don't look like the kind of guy
who'd be involved in that sort of...

1004
01:03:10,665 --> 01:03:13,260
Why didn't you just leave
that heroin dealer alone?

1005
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:17,388
I was a mob accountant.

1006
01:03:18,131 --> 01:03:20,554
I thought I worked
in a legitimate firm.

1007
01:03:21,009 --> 01:03:23,432
When I found out I was managing
accounts that were fronts for Serrano

1008
01:03:23,637 --> 01:03:25,515
I couldn't just sit back and do nothing.

1009
01:03:25,723 --> 01:03:27,976
Yeah, but Jon, you still took
what didn't belong to you.

1010
01:03:28,184 --> 01:03:30,027
How can you be
on the side of a mobster?

1011
01:03:30,228 --> 01:03:32,777
- I'm not on the side of a mobster.
- You're on his side if you're not on my side.

1012
01:03:32,981 --> 01:03:34,904
I'm not on anybody's side.
I got nothing to do with it.

1013
01:03:35,108 --> 01:03:36,576
You got everything to do with it.

1014
01:03:36,776 --> 01:03:38,950
You're takin' me to jail
and in jail you know I'll be killed.

1015
01:03:39,154 --> 01:03:41,452
- That's not my problem.
- It's not your problem?

1016
01:03:41,657 --> 01:03:43,284
It's not your problem?

1017
01:03:45,202 --> 01:03:47,330
Did you read about me in the papers?

1018
01:03:47,788 --> 01:03:49,415
- Yeah, I did.
- Were you on my side then?

1019
01:03:49,623 --> 01:03:51,342
- Yeah, I was.
- Then why aren't you now?

1020
01:03:51,543 --> 01:03:54,046
- Because now you're in my way.
- I'm in your way?

1021
01:03:54,254 --> 01:03:56,348
What you mean is you want the money
for turning me in

1022
01:03:56,548 --> 01:04:00,598
because that's all you're about.
You're just about the fuckin' money.

1023
01:04:03,847 --> 01:04:05,600
Hey, Jon.

1024
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:07,943
You can think
whatever you want to think.

1025
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:12,069
Doesn't matter to me, 'cause I'm gettin'
my $100,000 any which way you want it.

1026
01:04:20,324 --> 01:04:21,997
Let's go.

1027
01:04:26,455 --> 01:04:29,208
Hey, Tony.
Tony, Hopalong Cassidy.

1028
01:04:29,416 --> 01:04:30,963
You got your camera?
Take a picture.

1029
01:04:31,168 --> 01:04:32,546
Come on,
they got these at the airport.

1030
01:04:32,754 --> 01:04:33,926
Should I get one
on the way back?

1031
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:35,222
Come on. Put that away.

1032
01:04:35,423 --> 01:04:37,300
I'm not gonna tell you again.

1033
01:04:38,593 --> 01:04:40,891
Tony, there they are.

1034
01:04:50,689 --> 01:04:52,612
- How you doin', Jack?
- Shit.

1035
01:04:52,816 --> 01:04:54,409
Jimmy sends his regards.

1036
01:04:56,111 --> 01:04:57,488
Don't worry, Jack.

1037
01:04:57,696 --> 01:05:00,325
We're not here for you.
We're here for him.

1038
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,377
What are you starin' at?

1039
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:05,167
Are you gonna propose?

1040
01:05:08,166 --> 01:05:09,292
Drop 'em!

1041
01:05:09,501 --> 01:05:11,721
I said, "Drop 'em," assholes!

1042
01:05:17,009 --> 01:05:18,477
Who the fuck are you guys?

1043
01:05:18,678 --> 01:05:20,180
Who the fuck are you?

1044
01:05:25,936 --> 01:05:29,440
You're dead.
You know who you're fuckin' with?

1045
01:05:29,648 --> 01:05:31,742
No. Why don't you tell me about it?

1046
01:05:31,942 --> 01:05:34,445
Make sure you speak
into the microphone.

1047
01:05:36,154 --> 01:05:37,576
Marvin, Marvin!

1048
01:05:39,158 --> 01:05:41,752
Very clever, Jack. Now give me the keys.

1049
01:05:42,328 --> 01:05:44,046
Come on! Give me the keys!

1050
01:05:44,956 --> 01:05:46,299
Keys.

1051
01:05:49,502 --> 01:05:51,220
Looks like a package deal
to me, Marvin.

1052
01:05:51,754 --> 01:05:53,883
Goddamn it. Come on! Both of you!

1053
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:58,971
Who the hell were those guys?

1054
01:05:59,179 --> 01:06:01,273
- Marvin, you did it this time.
- What are you talkin' about?

1055
01:06:01,473 --> 01:06:03,066
Those are hired killers back there.

1056
01:06:03,267 --> 01:06:05,691
- Hired to kill who?
- Hired to kill this guy.

1057
01:06:05,895 --> 01:06:08,569
- Me. Me, can you believe it?
- Hired by who?

1058
01:06:08,773 --> 01:06:11,117
Hired by who? Jimmy Serrano.
That's who.

1059
01:06:11,317 --> 01:06:13,411
Oh, fuck.
Why do they want to kill this guy?

1060
01:06:13,611 --> 01:06:15,363
Don't you read the papers,
knucklehead?

1061
01:06:15,572 --> 01:06:17,495
- Yeah, I read the fuckin' papers.
- I can't take this.

1062
01:06:18,701 --> 01:06:21,454
They got away. Grey Dodge.
Get after them.

1063
01:06:21,829 --> 01:06:23,126
How the fuck
did you know where we were?

1064
01:06:23,330 --> 01:06:25,378
- I can't take this.
- Shut up a minute. Did Eddie put you on this?

1065
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:27,802
- Of course Eddie put me on this.
- That son of a bitch!

1066
01:06:28,002 --> 01:06:30,300
- You know I have a contract with him?
- You got a contract?

1067
01:06:30,504 --> 01:06:32,051
- Yeah, I signed it on Monday.
- He called me in Pittsburgh.

1068
01:06:32,257 --> 01:06:34,100
He said you were
fucking this thing up.

1069
01:06:34,301 --> 01:06:35,644
I'm not fuckin' anything up.

1070
01:06:35,844 --> 01:06:37,471
You should've been in LA two days ago.

1071
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:40,603
Hey Marvin, don't tell me how to do my goddamn
job! I'm half-thinkin' not to turn him in

1072
01:06:40,807 --> 01:06:42,901
just to watch Eddie
go down the fuckin' toilet.

1073
01:06:43,101 --> 01:06:45,946
- See, that's a good thought.
- What? Who the hell's talkin' to you?

1074
01:06:46,147 --> 01:06:49,492
Yeah, who the fuck's talkin' to you? He's not
yours to take anymore, limpdick. He's mine.

1075
01:06:49,692 --> 01:06:51,820
[helicopter approaching]
Do you hear that?

1076
01:06:52,487 --> 01:06:54,615
Fuck! Now who the fuck is this?

1077
01:06:55,114 --> 01:06:57,116
[gunfire]

1078
01:06:58,743 --> 01:07:00,462
Jesus Christ!

1079
01:07:02,289 --> 01:07:03,632
Do something!

1080
01:07:06,502 --> 01:07:11,349
You guys are the dumbest
bounty hunters I've ever seen!

1081
01:07:13,468 --> 01:07:15,266
[gunfire]

1082
01:07:16,221 --> 01:07:18,724
You couldn't even
deliver a bottle of milk!

1083
01:07:21,226 --> 01:07:22,773
[gunfire]
[Jon screams]

1084
01:07:22,977 --> 01:07:25,400
Will you shut the fuck up?

1085
01:07:33,531 --> 01:07:35,204
Where the hell did he go?

1086
01:07:36,325 --> 01:07:38,999
- You think we lost him?
- I don't know. I don't see anything.

1087
01:07:39,203 --> 01:07:41,298
Oh, I'm sure we're completely safe.

1088
01:07:42,666 --> 01:07:45,044
[screams]
[gunfire]

1089
01:07:49,130 --> 01:07:50,928
[horn honks]

1090
01:07:51,132 --> 01:07:52,931
[tires screech]

1091
01:08:04,605 --> 01:08:07,530
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm enjoying it.

1092
01:08:07,693 --> 01:08:10,572
- Marvin, Marvin, give me a gun.
- No fuckin' way!

1093
01:08:11,238 --> 01:08:13,036
[gunfire]

1094
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:18,795
- Will you give me a fucking gun?
- Give him a gun, Marvin!

1095
01:08:18,996 --> 01:08:20,499
Don't fuck me, Jack!

1096
01:08:20,707 --> 01:08:21,833
Yeah, yeah.

1097
01:08:22,041 --> 01:08:23,839
[gunfire]

1098
01:08:30,466 --> 01:08:31,968
Shit.

1099
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:37,309
They're not after me.
Just kidding, just kidding.

1100
01:08:37,516 --> 01:08:40,190
- Thought you threw those away.
- Always check the evidence, Marvin.

1101
01:08:40,394 --> 01:08:41,941
Those were car keys.

1102
01:08:45,482 --> 01:08:47,861
[screams]

1103
01:08:49,863 --> 01:08:51,536
[gunfire]

1104
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:54,243
Son of a bitch! There goes $100,000.

1105
01:08:54,451 --> 01:08:57,125
$100,000? Eddie was gonna
pay you $100,000?

1106
01:08:57,287 --> 01:09:00,007
. Why? What was he gonna pay you?
<i>'</i> $25,000.

1107
01:09:00,958 --> 01:09:02,551
Son of a bitch!

1108
01:09:14,431 --> 01:09:16,650
[gunfire]

1109
01:09:32,283 --> 01:09:34,661
Holy shit, Jack! You got him!

1110
01:09:35,495 --> 01:09:37,293
[laughs]

1111
01:09:37,497 --> 01:09:39,295
Marvin!

1112
01:09:51,011 --> 01:09:52,684
What the hell are you doin', Jack?

1113
01:09:56,142 --> 01:09:57,610
See you in LA, Marvin.

1114
01:10:49,283 --> 01:10:52,457
[Jack]: Jon! Jon!

1115
01:10:53,203 --> 01:10:56,673
Jon! Where the fuck are you, Jon?

1116
01:10:58,834 --> 01:11:03,215
Give me your hand. I'm slippery.
I can't hold on. Give me your hand.

1117
01:11:07,677 --> 01:11:09,520
<i>Where are you gain'?</i>

1118
01:11:10,388 --> 01:11:11,810
Jon!

1119
01:11:14,226 --> 01:11:15,603
Jon!

1120
01:11:19,023 --> 01:11:20,275
Good.

1121
01:11:21,942 --> 01:11:23,239
- Promise you'll let me go?
- What?

1122
01:11:23,861 --> 01:11:26,239
Do you promise to let me go?

1123
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,167
Fuck you!

1124
01:11:29,326 --> 01:11:31,374
- Promise to let me go!
- Fuck you.

1125
01:11:31,578 --> 01:11:35,208
You're making it very difficult for me
to do the right thing here.

1126
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:41,594
All right. I promise I'll let you go.

1127
01:11:59,399 --> 01:12:00,867
Jesus.

1128
01:12:01,568 --> 01:12:03,115
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1129
01:12:07,616 --> 01:12:09,244
Thanks for saving my life.

1130
01:12:10,036 --> 01:12:11,754
Thanks for lettin' me go.

1131
01:12:14,916 --> 01:12:19,012
I'll let you go, all right.
The second you're in LA County Jail.

1132
01:12:19,796 --> 01:12:21,219
Come on.

1133
01:12:26,303 --> 01:12:28,101
Yeah, that's right. Down here!

1134
01:12:28,722 --> 01:12:30,975
Are you gonna stand there
with your thumb up your ass

1135
01:12:31,183 --> 01:12:33,026
or are you gonna get me
the fuck out of here?

1136
01:12:40,610 --> 01:12:42,203
This just came in.

1137
01:12:44,156 --> 01:12:45,783
Is this gonna upset me?

1138
01:12:45,991 --> 01:12:48,745
I think it's safe to say that.

1139
01:12:50,121 --> 01:12:54,922
Are you familiar with a dish,
a potato dish, lyonnaise potato?

1140
01:12:55,084 --> 01:12:59,305
It's a kind of fried potato.

1141
01:12:59,505 --> 01:13:02,180
But it's got, like, an onion in it.
It's quite delicious.

1142
01:13:02,342 --> 01:13:07,815
It really goes beautifully
with steak, chops,

1143
01:13:08,015 --> 01:13:11,064
you know, hamburger, cheeseburger,
any of your meat dishes.

1144
01:13:11,268 --> 01:13:12,770
It's just a...

1145
01:13:13,353 --> 01:13:15,652
You know, I have... I have
enough money to buy

1146
01:13:15,857 --> 01:13:18,280
- Look.
- ...as much lyonnaise potatoes

1147
01:13:18,484 --> 01:13:22,114
- ...as you ever would enjoy.
- Just shut the fuck up, will you, please?

1148
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:24,157
I just think you ought
to think about it a little bit,

1149
01:13:24,324 --> 01:13:26,372
because it's nothing...

1150
01:13:26,576 --> 01:13:29,251
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1151
01:13:29,496 --> 01:13:34,297
Oh, thank you, thank you.
Thank you. Very much.

1152
01:13:34,543 --> 01:13:36,216
Cover that.

1153
01:13:39,381 --> 01:13:42,226
Hi, you think you could give us
a ride to the next town?

1154
01:13:42,385 --> 01:13:44,137
- Sure. Jump in the back.
- Thanks a lot.

1155
01:13:44,304 --> 01:13:48,229
Great, great. See? For every shit,
there's six nice people.

1156
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:51,353
- Jahé, everyone. Jahé.
- Jahé.

1157
01:13:51,561 --> 01:13:52,483
What's that?

1158
01:13:52,687 --> 01:13:55,692
It's "Hello." I can say "Hello"
in a lot of different languages.

1159
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:58,198
Not yours, but a lot of them.

1160
01:14:03,783 --> 01:14:05,251
Welcome, sir.

1161
01:14:09,998 --> 01:14:13,127
- I'm not lookin' forward to this.
- What, do you think I am?

1162
01:14:13,293 --> 01:14:14,966
I don't understand the problem
with you two.

1163
01:14:15,170 --> 01:14:16,296
The guy's a fuckin' accountant.

1164
01:14:16,505 --> 01:14:17,722
Jimmy, it's been bad luck
right down the line.

1165
01:14:17,923 --> 01:14:19,175
Plus this guy Walsh is pretty good.

1166
01:14:19,341 --> 01:14:21,469
If he's that good, Tony,
maybe I should hire him to hit you.

1167
01:14:21,677 --> 01:14:24,056
I hope there's no chance of any
of this coming back to Jimmy.

1168
01:14:24,264 --> 01:14:26,483
No chance.
Rented the chopper out of Kansas City.

1169
01:14:26,724 --> 01:14:29,273
He's five times removed from you.
So you're clear of this. Don't worry.

1170
01:14:29,477 --> 01:14:32,447
Clear as shit, you fuckin' moron!
The guy is still out there, ain't he?

1171
01:14:32,647 --> 01:14:34,273
Let me tell you two guys somethin'.

1172
01:14:34,274 --> 01:14:37,119
I'm not interested in seein'
either of you two alive again

1173
01:14:37,278 --> 01:14:39,576
until you get the accountant,
you got the message?

1174
01:14:49,791 --> 01:14:52,169
[chickens squawking]

1175
01:14:56,214 --> 01:14:57,215
It's the end of the ride.

1176
01:14:57,382 --> 01:14:59,055
- This is it?
- This is it.

1177
01:14:59,259 --> 01:15:02,263
Is there a real... a real town
around here some place?

1178
01:15:02,471 --> 01:15:04,223
- Channing.
- Channing?

1179
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:05,357
Yeah.

1180
01:15:05,558 --> 01:15:06,775
How far is that from here?

1181
01:15:06,976 --> 01:15:10,776
- Thirty miles.
- Thirty miles. Jesus Christ.

1182
01:15:15,026 --> 01:15:17,576
[chickens clucking]

1183
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:21,078
What the hell kind of town is this?

1184
01:15:32,503 --> 01:15:35,131
Is there someone that can give us
a ride to Channing?

1185
01:15:35,298 --> 01:15:37,471
Is there anyone going
in that direction?

1186
01:15:37,675 --> 01:15:38,892
No, don't have a ride.

1187
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:39,977
Excuse me a minute.

1188
01:15:40,178 --> 01:15:42,226
Is there a bathroom
in there I could use?

1189
01:15:42,388 --> 01:15:43,606
Yeah, go ahead.

1190
01:15:44,641 --> 01:15:46,393
Is there a telephone here?

1191
01:15:47,478 --> 01:15:49,947
- Telephone.
- No, no, no telephone.

1192
01:15:50,147 --> 01:15:51,865
No telephone? Nothing.

1193
01:15:52,066 --> 01:15:54,364
[speaking other language]

1194
01:15:54,568 --> 01:15:57,163
[all laughing]

1195
01:16:01,159 --> 01:16:03,287
Glad you're all havin' a good time.

1196
01:16:04,662 --> 01:16:07,085
[engine sputtering]

1197
01:16:28,355 --> 01:16:30,733
Fear of flying, you son of a bitch?

1198
01:16:30,941 --> 01:16:33,785
Get over here!
Get back here, you son of a bitch!

1199
01:16:35,362 --> 01:16:37,491
Get over here! Stop!

1200
01:16:38,491 --> 01:16:39,834
Stop!

1201
01:16:45,415 --> 01:16:47,292
Fear of flying my ass,
you son of a bitch!

1202
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:48,467
Get out of that plane!

1203
01:16:50,421 --> 01:16:52,674
You're a goddamn pilot,
you son of a bitch?

1204
01:16:52,881 --> 01:16:55,885
I didn't feel it was appropriate
to share that with you, Jack.

1205
01:16:56,093 --> 01:16:57,936
I'm gonna fucking appropriate
your head, goddamn it.

1206
01:16:58,137 --> 01:16:59,605
How do you turn this
fucking thing off?

1207
01:17:03,016 --> 01:17:06,066
Turn it off!
Turn it off!

1208
01:17:06,396 --> 01:17:09,149
Hang in there!
I'm gonna let it down easy!

1209
01:17:15,155 --> 01:17:16,954
Turn this fucking thing off!

1210
01:17:20,411 --> 01:17:22,254
Oh, shit!

1211
01:17:37,304 --> 01:17:39,272
Pilot? You're a goddamn pilot?

1212
01:17:39,431 --> 01:17:41,934
You're a pilot?
Here, I'll show you a pilot.

1213
01:17:42,225 --> 01:17:43,899
Let me tell you
about the coffee shop

1214
01:17:44,103 --> 01:17:45,776
I'm gonna open up
after I dump you off

1215
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:48,074
and get my $100,000.
You're gonna love it.

1216
01:17:52,737 --> 01:17:54,614
All right, get back!
Get back! Get back!

1217
01:17:54,822 --> 01:17:56,119
Everybody back, back!

1218
01:17:56,699 --> 01:17:59,579
- Give me the keys to the truck.
- You can't steal their truck.

1219
01:17:59,786 --> 01:18:01,254
Shut up!
You were about to steal a plane!

1220
01:18:01,413 --> 01:18:04,166
- What are you talking about?
- I'm trying to save my life!

1221
01:18:04,333 --> 01:18:05,550
You're right,
I should give them something.

1222
01:18:05,751 --> 01:18:06,752
Give me your watch.

1223
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,837
- My watch? Shit!
- Give me your watch!

1224
01:18:09,296 --> 01:18:11,720
Keep it. It's worth a lot of money.

1225
01:18:11,925 --> 01:18:12,767
Get in.

1226
01:18:13,259 --> 01:18:14,385
Stand back!

1227
01:18:14,594 --> 01:18:15,846
Get in.

1228
01:18:16,471 --> 01:18:17,643
Get in!

1229
01:18:20,558 --> 01:18:22,310
Jack, let's be fair about this.

1230
01:18:22,519 --> 01:18:24,113
You lied to me first.

1231
01:18:24,313 --> 01:18:27,237
- At the river.
- What? Get the fuck...

1232
01:18:27,441 --> 01:18:30,160
- At the river!
- You lied to me first.

1233
01:18:30,319 --> 01:18:33,698
- You got some fuckin' nerve!
- No. You lied to me first.

1234
01:18:33,948 --> 01:18:35,996
You lied to me first.

1235
01:18:37,827 --> 01:18:41,252
Yes, yes, I lied to you first
but you had no knowledge

1236
01:18:41,456 --> 01:18:43,424
I was lying about my fear of flying

1237
01:18:43,708 --> 01:18:45,710
at the river when you lied to me.

1238
01:18:45,877 --> 01:18:48,847
So as far as you knew,
you lied to me first.

1239
01:18:50,173 --> 01:18:52,643
Can't even argue with you. I don't even
know what the fuck you're talking about.

1240
01:18:52,843 --> 01:18:55,892
I'm just saying you lied to me first
as far as you knew.

1241
01:18:56,097 --> 01:18:56,848
Jesus.

1242
01:18:57,056 --> 01:18:58,808
- What's the matter?
- I got an ulcer.

1243
01:18:59,016 --> 01:19:00,438
- An ulcer?
- Yeah, I got an ulcer.

1244
01:19:00,643 --> 01:19:01,610
I got a big fucking ulcer,

1245
01:19:01,811 --> 01:19:03,859
and all your bullshit
started to make it bleed again.

1246
01:19:04,064 --> 01:19:05,281
You know why you have an ulcer?

1247
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,158
Because you have
two forms of expression:

1248
01:19:07,317 --> 01:19:09,319
Silence and rage.

1249
01:19:14,157 --> 01:19:15,409
You should get some milk
to coat it.

1250
01:19:15,617 --> 01:19:17,085
Don't tell me what I need.

1251
01:19:17,286 --> 01:19:18,504
I need something to eat,
that's what I need.

1252
01:19:18,746 --> 01:19:20,919
What are we gonna buy it with? Dirt?

1253
01:19:21,374 --> 01:19:23,342
You drive to the next town.
I'll take care of it.

1254
01:19:23,543 --> 01:19:24,544
- You'll take care of it?
- I'll take care of it.

1255
01:19:24,794 --> 01:19:25,920
What do you mean,
you'll take care of it?

1256
01:19:26,129 --> 01:19:27,255
Drive to the next town.

1257
01:19:30,133 --> 01:19:31,852
But you lied to me first.

1258
01:19:41,979 --> 01:19:44,198
- Now what?
- Give me that FBI badge.

1259
01:19:45,859 --> 01:19:49,363
- The FBI badge?
- Yeah, give me the FBI badge.

1260
01:19:59,498 --> 01:20:00,499
Uncuff me.

1261
01:20:00,708 --> 01:20:02,255
- Uncuff you?
- Uncuff me.

1262
01:20:03,544 --> 01:20:05,842
Want to eat? Want a nice meal?

1263
01:20:06,130 --> 01:20:10,385
Want some of that shit you eat?
Come on. Uncuff me.

1264
01:20:17,768 --> 01:20:18,769
You fuck with me...

1265
01:20:18,977 --> 01:20:21,947
And you'll hit me on the head
and drop me in a thing.

1266
01:20:22,147 --> 01:20:23,774
Right. Come on.
Uncuff me.

1267
01:20:32,325 --> 01:20:34,293
- Who's in charge here?
- Who wants to know?

1268
01:20:34,494 --> 01:20:37,373
- Me.
- That'd be the manager.

1269
01:20:37,747 --> 01:20:39,750
I'd like to see the manager
as soon as possible.

1270
01:20:39,958 --> 01:20:41,426
Yes, sir.

1271
01:20:46,131 --> 01:20:47,929
Sorry.

1272
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:58,403
- Yeah?
- Alonzo Mosely, FBI.

1273
01:20:59,979 --> 01:21:01,856
My partner and I have been
tracking a ring of counterfeiters

1274
01:21:02,065 --> 01:21:04,568
passing phony $20 bills
across the state.

1275
01:21:04,776 --> 01:21:07,576
Have you received any $20 bills
in the last couple of hours?

1276
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:10,249
Yeah, sure,
we get 'em all the time.

1277
01:21:13,661 --> 01:21:17,541
You get them all the time. Would
you mind taking two steps backwards?

1278
01:21:19,751 --> 01:21:21,970
Would you mind opening the register?

1279
01:21:24,464 --> 01:21:26,137
No, don't touch them.

1280
01:21:27,384 --> 01:21:28,385
Excuse me.

1281
01:21:29,469 --> 01:21:31,642
Contract two, Hank. Check 'em out.

1282
01:21:33,015 --> 01:21:34,858
Give him a pencil, please.

1283
01:21:41,566 --> 01:21:43,443
Do the litmus configuration.

1284
01:21:45,362 --> 01:21:47,114
Doing the litmus configuration?

1285
01:21:47,322 --> 01:21:49,074
- Litmus configuration.
- Yes.

1286
01:21:54,913 --> 01:21:57,336
You seen any suspicious-looking
characters around here?

1287
01:21:57,541 --> 01:21:58,885
Nope.

1288
01:21:59,210 --> 01:22:02,009
- Do you live around here?
- Yep.

1289
01:22:06,718 --> 01:22:08,891
- How does it look?
- This one's bad.

1290
01:22:12,266 --> 01:22:14,268
Would you describe exactly
what the last man

1291
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:16,983
who passed a $20 bill
to you looked like?

1292
01:22:17,188 --> 01:22:19,282
- Thirty. Tall.
- About 6 feet tall?

1293
01:22:19,565 --> 01:22:21,238
<i>_</i> 6! 5"-
Dark brown hair?

1294
01:22:21,609 --> 01:22:22,861
Light colored.

1295
01:22:23,527 --> 01:22:25,370
- Sounds like our man.
- That's him.

1296
01:22:25,614 --> 01:22:27,491
We're gonna take
these bills for evidence.

1297
01:22:27,699 --> 01:22:28,575
Make them a receipt.

1298
01:22:28,784 --> 01:22:30,331
- This one's bad, too.
- This one's bad, too.

1299
01:22:30,535 --> 01:22:32,287
I'd like you to notify all
the other establishments

1300
01:22:32,454 --> 01:22:33,455
in the area of this situation.

1301
01:22:33,663 --> 01:22:35,040
What's the name of your establishment?

1302
01:22:35,248 --> 01:22:36,591
- Red's Corner Bar.
- Are you Red?

1303
01:22:36,792 --> 01:22:38,510
Yes, sir.

1304
01:22:38,710 --> 01:22:40,258
Do you dye your hair?

1305
01:22:40,421 --> 01:22:41,388
No.

1306
01:22:41,589 --> 01:22:42,966
Why do they call you "Red"?

1307
01:22:43,174 --> 01:22:45,893
It's short for Redwood.
My last name's Wood.

1308
01:22:46,385 --> 01:22:48,353
- What's your first name?
- Bill.

1309
01:22:51,390 --> 01:22:53,485
Thank you for your cooperation, Bill.

1310
01:22:53,769 --> 01:22:55,066
Hank.

1311
01:22:57,105 --> 01:22:59,483
These are all bad. Those are good.

1312
01:23:14,916 --> 01:23:17,135
- Come on. We're gonna get this train.
- What?

1313
01:23:17,335 --> 01:23:18,928
We're gonna catch this train.
Come on.

1314
01:23:19,171 --> 01:23:20,514
I can't catch a train.

1315
01:23:20,714 --> 01:23:22,512
You also couldn't fly.
Start running. Let's go.

1316
01:23:22,716 --> 01:23:25,390
Wait a minute. Wait!
It's a freight train!

1317
01:23:26,428 --> 01:23:30,274
I can't do this!
I can't do this!

1318
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:40,994
I deeply feel I can't do this.

1319
01:23:41,194 --> 01:23:42,571
I thought you liked
to travel by train.

1320
01:23:42,779 --> 01:23:44,201
Get up there!

1321
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:52,708
- What are you doing?
- Promise to let me go?

1322
01:23:52,915 --> 01:23:55,964
- Open the fuckin' door!
- See you in the next life, Jack.

1323
01:23:56,377 --> 01:23:58,175
Son of a bitch!

1324
01:23:58,379 --> 01:24:01,008
You son of a bitch!
Open that fuckin' door!

1325
01:24:15,189 --> 01:24:16,691
Glad to see me?

1326
01:24:17,358 --> 01:24:19,531
I guess we're in the next life, Jon.

1327
01:24:19,736 --> 01:24:22,034
- Don't overreact now.
- Don't overreact?

1328
01:24:22,238 --> 01:24:24,991
I won't overreact! Get over here!
Overreact?

1329
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:27,999
You do this again,
I'll throw you off the fuckin' train!

1330
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:30,752
Jack, Jack, it's a bad...

1331
01:24:30,956 --> 01:24:32,879
Get down there!
Put your hand in there!

1332
01:24:33,083 --> 01:24:34,710
- Easy, Jack. Easy, easy.
- There.

1333
01:24:35,336 --> 01:24:36,963
You son of a bitch!

1334
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:41,973
- Jack?
- You shut up!

1335
01:24:42,177 --> 01:24:44,396
I'm not talking to you
for the whole rest of this trip!

1336
01:24:47,974 --> 01:24:51,274
Hey, you guys gonna let me go or what?
I'm telling you I don't know anything.

1337
01:24:51,436 --> 01:24:52,653
Is that a fact?

1338
01:24:53,648 --> 01:24:54,991
Oh, shit.

1339
01:25:02,907 --> 01:25:05,751
Why don't you quit?
It'd be cheaper for both of us.

1340
01:25:13,001 --> 01:25:14,173
Where are they?

1341
01:25:14,378 --> 01:25:15,550
You got me.

1342
01:25:16,588 --> 01:25:18,215
- Inspector.
- Shut up.

1343
01:25:18,382 --> 01:25:20,306
Now you listen, you son of a bitch.

1344
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:22,228
I want answers
and I want them right now.

1345
01:25:22,387 --> 01:25:24,060
What do you want from me?
I don't know nothin'.

1346
01:25:28,893 --> 01:25:30,691
Sir...

1347
01:25:31,396 --> 01:25:35,322
It seems that an Agent Alonzo Mosely
and his partner

1348
01:25:35,567 --> 01:25:38,992
were seen hopping a westbound
freight train near Channing.

1349
01:25:41,615 --> 01:25:43,083
Come on.

1350
01:25:44,326 --> 01:25:46,749
[horn sounds]

1351
01:25:59,968 --> 01:26:01,562
- Jack?
- What?

1352
01:26:04,682 --> 01:26:06,309
How much further
do you think we have to go?

1353
01:26:06,517 --> 01:26:08,565
[imitating Jack]
None of your fuckin' business!

1354
01:26:08,769 --> 01:26:10,988
You know, because eventually
I'm gonna have to go to the bathroom.

1355
01:26:11,230 --> 01:26:12,527
[imitating Jack]
Shut the fuck up!

1356
01:26:19,031 --> 01:26:21,284
Did you ever have sex
with an animal, Jack?

1357
01:26:24,870 --> 01:26:27,841
Remember those chickens
around the Indian reservation?

1358
01:26:28,041 --> 01:26:29,964
<i>There were some good-Rankin'
chickens there, Jack.</i>

1359
01:26:30,168 --> 01:26:31,795
You know, between us.

1360
01:26:32,086 --> 01:26:35,135
Yeah, there were a couple there
I might have taken a shot at.

1361
01:26:39,177 --> 01:26:41,226
What's with you and that watch?
What is it with the watch?

1362
01:26:41,388 --> 01:26:43,265
You told me when you
get to know me better.

1363
01:26:43,432 --> 01:26:45,560
You told me about your feelings
for chickens.

1364
01:26:45,768 --> 01:26:48,942
How private could the watch be?
What's the big secret?

1365
01:26:53,484 --> 01:26:55,988
Gail bought me this watch.
She gave it to me.

1366
01:26:56,196 --> 01:26:58,290
It was the first thing
she ever gave me.

1367
01:27:02,118 --> 01:27:06,294
She, uh... she bought it
because I was always late

1368
01:27:06,498 --> 01:27:08,172
by at least a half an hour.

1369
01:27:08,334 --> 01:27:13,135
So she bought it and set it ahead
a half an hour so I'd never be late.

1370
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:23,437
Somewhere in the back of my mind

1371
01:27:23,642 --> 01:27:25,315
I keep thinking we're gonna
wind up together again.

1372
01:27:25,477 --> 01:27:28,777
I don't know why I'm still hanging on.
I'm still waitin' around.

1373
01:27:33,777 --> 01:27:35,872
<i>I don't think she's cumin' back.</i>

1374
01:27:38,449 --> 01:27:39,996
Yeah, I don't either.

1375
01:27:40,785 --> 01:27:42,253
I don't either.

1376
01:27:44,413 --> 01:27:46,666
Sometimes you just have to let go.

1377
01:27:49,795 --> 01:27:51,672
Just get yourself a new watch.

1378
01:27:59,054 --> 01:28:01,102
You're okay, Jack.

1379
01:28:03,601 --> 01:28:05,023
I think...

1380
01:28:05,812 --> 01:28:07,985
under different circumstances...

1381
01:28:09,482 --> 01:28:10,699
you and I...

1382
01:28:11,901 --> 01:28:14,154
probably still would've
hated each other.

1383
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:16,164
[both laugh]

1384
01:28:19,076 --> 01:28:21,204
We probably could've been friends.

1385
01:28:23,372 --> 01:28:25,045
In the next life.

1386
01:28:26,167 --> 01:28:28,011
Yeah, the next life.

1387
01:28:33,717 --> 01:28:34,889
Yeah, great.

1388
01:28:35,343 --> 01:28:37,471
Accommodations were wonderful.

1389
01:28:39,097 --> 01:28:41,065
- You got a smoke?
- Don't smoke.

1390
01:28:42,226 --> 01:28:43,944
That fed took my cigarettes.

1391
01:28:44,145 --> 01:28:46,022
You want your cigarettes back?

1392
01:28:46,272 --> 01:28:48,320
Then you're gonna have to go
to Flagstaff to get 'em,

1393
01:28:48,482 --> 01:28:51,201
'cause that's where
your pal Mosely went.

1394
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,203
[chuckles]

1395
01:28:54,197 --> 01:28:55,791
Just might do that.

1396
01:29:01,914 --> 01:29:03,587
Where do you figure we are?

1397
01:29:04,333 --> 01:29:07,303
My guess would be Arizona.
We've been goin' west all night.

1398
01:29:07,461 --> 01:29:09,180
I think we're almost home.

1399
01:29:12,008 --> 01:29:14,010
I'm almost dead.

1400
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:21,773
Hey, look, John.

1401
01:29:21,977 --> 01:29:24,196
You know, the Witness
Protection Program isn't so bad.

1402
01:29:24,772 --> 01:29:26,945
They'll give you a new name.
You'll have a new life.

1403
01:29:27,149 --> 01:29:29,698
I'm not gonna make it
to any witness protection program.

1404
01:29:29,902 --> 01:29:32,121
- You don't know that, Jon.
- I know it. You know it.

1405
01:29:32,321 --> 01:29:35,826
Serrano's gonna get to me before I get
to any Witness Protection Program.

1406
01:29:36,409 --> 01:29:37,626
Do me a favor.

1407
01:29:37,869 --> 01:29:41,248
Don't pretend you care about me.
It really insults my intelligence.

1408
01:29:41,414 --> 01:29:42,586
I mean, let's face it.

1409
01:29:42,791 --> 01:29:45,010
The only important thing
about me to you

1410
01:29:45,210 --> 01:29:46,803
is gettin' your money.

1411
01:29:47,128 --> 01:29:50,008
You know, I'm really tired of you
makin' me out to be some kind of thug

1412
01:29:50,216 --> 01:29:52,435
whose only concern
is a big chunk of change.

1413
01:29:52,718 --> 01:29:55,267
Did you know that Serrano's people
offered me $1,000,000 for you?

1414
01:29:55,429 --> 01:29:58,182
Why didn't you go for the big money?
You're doing his work for him anyway.

1415
01:29:58,349 --> 01:29:59,601
I'm workin' for him anyway?

1416
01:29:59,809 --> 01:30:01,402
You don't know what
the fuck you're talkin' about.

1417
01:30:01,602 --> 01:30:03,947
The reason I do this shit
in the first place

1418
01:30:04,147 --> 01:30:06,445
is 'cause I wouldn't work
for that lowlife asshole.

1419
01:30:07,442 --> 01:30:09,945
- What does that mean?
- Nothin'.

1420
01:30:10,153 --> 01:30:11,746
Doesn't mean anything.

1421
01:30:16,119 --> 01:30:19,749
Serrano is the heroin dealer
you told me about in Chicago?

1422
01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:25,337
Who owned your buddies
and destroyed your life?

1423
01:30:25,545 --> 01:30:27,218
That's Serrano?

1424
01:30:29,216 --> 01:30:31,765
That's the guy
that you're takin' me in...

1425
01:30:32,428 --> 01:30:34,681
That's the guy that's gonna kill me?

1426
01:30:39,310 --> 01:30:41,859
Hope it's a wonderful
coffee shop, Jack.

1427
01:30:59,623 --> 01:31:02,502
- Come on. We're gettin' off.
- What? What? What?

1428
01:31:02,918 --> 01:31:05,046
We are getting off here,
Mr. Railroad Man.

1429
01:31:05,254 --> 01:31:06,631
- Come on.
- What? What? No, come on!

1430
01:31:06,839 --> 01:31:08,557
- You should be good at this.
- What are you talkin' about?

1431
01:31:08,758 --> 01:31:10,887
Come on!
Let's discuss this!

1432
01:31:21,938 --> 01:31:24,158
- Find anything?
- Not yet.

1433
01:31:24,484 --> 01:31:27,033
They could've jumped off the train
anywhere along the line.

1434
01:31:35,495 --> 01:31:37,464
Trains have regularly scheduled stops.

1435
01:31:37,664 --> 01:31:41,885
The reason for that is, y'know, because people
plan to get off the trains when they stop.

1436
01:31:42,086 --> 01:31:43,713
And that's how,
generally, people do it.

1437
01:31:43,921 --> 01:31:47,050
They don't, like, throw
each other off the trains.

1438
01:31:47,257 --> 01:31:50,432
That's the purpose of having stops.

1439
01:31:51,554 --> 01:31:52,601
What's this?

1440
01:31:52,847 --> 01:31:55,441
What are you gonna do?
What are you doin' now?

1441
01:31:56,976 --> 01:31:59,445
What are you doin'?
What are you doin'?

1442
01:32:03,567 --> 01:32:06,741
Oh, Christ, Christ!
Come on! Come on!

1443
01:32:06,946 --> 01:32:08,072
Are you kidding?

1444
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:11,079
They're gonna come out
and shoot us, for Christ's sake.

1445
01:32:11,367 --> 01:32:12,619
What the hell?

1446
01:32:13,369 --> 01:32:14,962
What the hell?

1447
01:32:15,162 --> 01:32:17,291
Jesus.
Oh, great!

1448
01:32:21,002 --> 01:32:22,800
You get it started...

1449
01:32:24,339 --> 01:32:27,843
and I'll run you over.
That's the best plan I can think of.

1450
01:32:29,469 --> 01:32:31,017
[engine starts]

1451
01:32:31,222 --> 01:32:33,850
Congratulations. Another crime.

1452
01:32:34,267 --> 01:32:35,769
Come on.

1453
01:32:38,104 --> 01:32:39,230
I don't like this.

1454
01:32:39,397 --> 01:32:42,867
I don't like anything you do,
to tell you the truth. Nothin'.

1455
01:32:54,329 --> 01:32:55,626
Where are we going?

1456
01:32:55,831 --> 01:32:57,675
To the nearest airport.

1457
01:33:02,422 --> 01:33:04,925
[sirens]

1458
01:33:05,341 --> 01:33:08,470
I'm not the kind of guy that says,
"I told you so," but...

1459
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:13,483
Oh, shit!

1460
01:33:15,561 --> 01:33:16,938
Looks like they've been spotted

1461
01:33:17,146 --> 01:33:19,114
around 35 miles south
of here near Sedona.

1462
01:33:19,315 --> 01:33:21,238
There are officers in pursuit.

1463
01:33:21,984 --> 01:33:23,532
Let's take the chopper.

1464
01:33:35,373 --> 01:33:38,924
This is-this is-this is the kind of
situation where something bad happens.

1465
01:33:42,757 --> 01:33:43,883
Easy!

1466
01:33:46,469 --> 01:33:48,597
Goddamn it, I don't like this!

1467
01:34:05,406 --> 01:34:07,454
[screams]

1468
01:34:07,659 --> 01:34:09,627
[horn honks]
Truck!

1469
01:34:48,995 --> 01:34:52,215
- Where are you goin', Jack?
- You'll find out when we get there.

1470
01:35:05,262 --> 01:35:06,730
I've come too far.

1471
01:35:07,389 --> 01:35:08,857
Too far.

1472
01:35:09,850 --> 01:35:11,694
I'm too close.

1473
01:35:38,632 --> 01:35:40,726
[screams]

1474
01:35:46,431 --> 01:35:48,024
[helicopter whirring]

1475
01:36:07,871 --> 01:36:10,374
Okay. I'm coming. All right.

1476
01:36:13,502 --> 01:36:15,004
- Come on.
- All right.

1477
01:36:25,390 --> 01:36:26,812
Here we go.

1478
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:29,861
Hello! Hello!

1479
01:36:33,857 --> 01:36:35,985
Am I lucky, or am I just good?

1480
01:36:36,402 --> 01:36:37,619
Is that Marvin?

1481
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:38,696
[chuckles]

1482
01:36:38,904 --> 01:36:40,497
Fuckin' A. I'm the best.

1483
01:36:40,698 --> 01:36:41,950
Marvin?

1484
01:36:42,157 --> 01:36:45,162
Hello, Jack, you dumb shit.

1485
01:36:53,545 --> 01:36:55,968
- Come on, you fuckin' pain in the ass!
- What was that?

1486
01:36:56,172 --> 01:36:57,344
Wait a minute.

1487
01:36:59,927 --> 01:37:02,521
If you move,
I'll tear your fuckin' lungs out!

1488
01:37:05,224 --> 01:37:06,692
See you in LA, Jack.

1489
01:37:32,295 --> 01:37:34,673
Shit.

1490
01:37:52,066 --> 01:37:53,864
Afternoon, sir.

1491
01:37:55,737 --> 01:37:58,536
- You're open?
- Oh, we're always open.

1492
01:38:01,493 --> 01:38:03,166
Hard day, huh?

1493
01:38:03,703 --> 01:38:05,046
Hard week.

1494
01:38:05,539 --> 01:38:07,291
Yeah, I know what you mean.

1495
01:38:08,459 --> 01:38:10,336
I could use a cup of coffee.

1496
01:38:11,212 --> 01:38:12,338
Yes sir.

1497
01:38:27,562 --> 01:38:29,235
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1498
01:38:32,568 --> 01:38:33,740
Keep 'em.

1499
01:38:48,210 --> 01:38:51,760
Gee, I been lookin'
all over for these.

1500
01:38:52,464 --> 01:38:53,807
Thanks, Alonzo.

1501
01:38:59,514 --> 01:39:01,312
Marvin, I have to tell you,

1502
01:39:01,516 --> 01:39:04,393
I have this very serious
fear of flying.

1503
01:39:04,394 --> 01:39:05,561
Yeah?

1504
01:39:05,562 --> 01:39:08,236
Why don't you just relax
and sleep through it?

1505
01:39:12,026 --> 01:39:13,654
Forget your deadline, Walsh.
That's over.

1506
01:39:13,821 --> 01:39:14,993
That's the way that one went.

1507
01:39:15,239 --> 01:39:17,458
I know my rights.
You owe me phone calls.

1508
01:39:17,658 --> 01:39:20,377
What should be of paramount importance
to you right now is not the phone call

1509
01:39:20,578 --> 01:39:22,376
but the fact that you're
gonna spend 10 years

1510
01:39:22,580 --> 01:39:23,923
for impersonating a federal agent.

1511
01:39:24,123 --> 01:39:25,875
- 10 years for impersonating a fed, huh?
- 10 years.

1512
01:39:26,084 --> 01:39:28,507
10 years. How come no one's after you?

1513
01:39:38,471 --> 01:39:40,019
Give this guy his calls.

1514
01:39:40,224 --> 01:39:41,601
Thanks.

1515
01:39:43,019 --> 01:39:44,942
Can I have a little privacy, please?

1516
01:39:54,990 --> 01:39:57,288
[phone rings]

1517
01:39:57,576 --> 01:39:59,044
Moscone's Bail Bonds.

1518
01:39:59,286 --> 01:40:00,788
It's Jack Walsh. Put Eddie on.

1519
01:40:01,038 --> 01:40:02,039
It's Jack.

1520
01:40:03,916 --> 01:40:07,672
Yeah. This better be good news, fuckin'
Jack, because you got five hours left.

1521
01:40:07,921 --> 01:40:08,592
No, it's not, Eddie.

1522
01:40:08,796 --> 01:40:11,094
I'm callin' to let you know that
you're a dead motherfucker.

1523
01:40:11,299 --> 01:40:11,891
You understand me?

1524
01:40:12,091 --> 01:40:13,388
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1525
01:40:13,593 --> 01:40:16,062
You put Marvin on this case,
you fucking piece of shit.

1526
01:40:16,262 --> 01:40:18,981
<i>You're fucking deceptive. You vermin!
You serpent!</i>

1527
01:40:19,182 --> 01:40:22,562
- Are you fuckin' done yet?
- You slime ball in a sea of pus!

1528
01:40:22,770 --> 01:40:24,943
- What?
- You blew it, all right?

1529
01:40:25,147 --> 01:40:28,071
You had the guy four fuckin' days,
Jack, four days!

1530
01:40:28,275 --> 01:40:30,403
You could've fuckin'...
you could've walked him backwards

1531
01:40:30,569 --> 01:40:32,822
and not fuckin' blown it,
but you blew it.

1532
01:40:33,030 --> 01:40:37,036
When have I ever let you down,
you fuckin' rat?

1533
01:40:37,285 --> 01:40:40,789
Are you fuckin' nuts,
tellin' Dorfler I offered you $100,000

1534
01:40:41,039 --> 01:40:43,212
when I told him I'd give him $25,000?

1535
01:40:44,167 --> 01:40:45,635
- When did you speak to him?
- What's the difference?

1536
01:40:45,835 --> 01:40:46,928
When did you speak to Marvin?

1537
01:40:47,129 --> 01:40:49,302
He called me fuckin', what, ten minutes ago

1538
01:40:49,465 --> 01:40:51,809
yellin' and screamin',
tellin' me to go fuck myself.

1539
01:40:52,009 --> 01:40:54,478
You're tellin' me, everybody's
tellin' me to go fuck myself?

1540
01:40:54,679 --> 01:40:57,432
<i>Am I supposed to just sit
on my fuckin' butt?</i>

1541
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:59,392
Eddie,
what are you fucking'talkin' about?

1542
01:40:59,642 --> 01:41:03,273
Look, you got five hours left. Can
you bring the fuckin' Duke in, yes or no?

1543
01:41:03,438 --> 01:41:05,111
I thought he's bringin' him to you.

1544
01:41:05,315 --> 01:41:08,114
I just talked to fuckin' Dorfler.
He don't have the Duke.

1545
01:41:08,318 --> 01:41:10,241
- What?
- Where's the fuckin' Duke?

1546
01:41:11,530 --> 01:41:13,248
- Hello?
- I'll talk to you later.

1547
01:41:13,408 --> 01:41:15,251
Jack!

1548
01:41:49,154 --> 01:41:51,031
- Hello?
- Yeah, Tony Darvo there, please?

1549
01:41:51,239 --> 01:41:53,412
- Who's calling?
- Marvin Dorfler.

1550
01:41:57,538 --> 01:41:58,630
Yo.

1551
01:41:58,831 --> 01:42:00,754
<i>[Man]: I got Marvin Dorfler on the line.
Shall I put him through?</i>

1552
01:42:00,958 --> 01:42:02,551
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Put him through.

1553
01:42:03,210 --> 01:42:04,712
Marvin.

1554
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:06,297
Everything still on schedule,
pal, isn't it?

1555
01:42:06,464 --> 01:42:08,467
So Dorfler's workin' for you guys.

1556
01:42:08,675 --> 01:42:10,643
- Who is this?
- This is Jack Walsh.

1557
01:42:10,844 --> 01:42:14,599
Jack, what are you complainin' for?
We came to you first, didn't we?

1558
01:42:14,848 --> 01:42:18,022
It's Jack Walsh.
Hold on. Somebody wants to say hello.

1559
01:42:19,644 --> 01:42:22,023
Hey.
Too late for you, scumbag.

1560
01:42:22,231 --> 01:42:23,483
No, no, no, too late for you.

1561
01:42:23,691 --> 01:42:25,238
I didn't come this far
not to collect my money.

1562
01:42:25,401 --> 01:42:28,200
You understand me, you motherfuckers?
I want the Duke back.

1563
01:42:28,404 --> 01:42:29,656
So what the fuck
are you tellin' me for?

1564
01:42:29,864 --> 01:42:32,617
What am I tellin' you for?
What am I tellin' you for?

1565
01:42:32,909 --> 01:42:34,708
I'll tell you what
I'm tellin' you for.

1566
01:42:34,953 --> 01:42:37,172
I got some of the Duke's belongings.
That's why.

1567
01:42:37,414 --> 01:42:40,088
Including some computer disks
that have every last detail

1568
01:42:40,334 --> 01:42:44,259
of Serrano's businesses and his
money-laundering operations. Everything.

1569
01:42:44,421 --> 01:42:47,140
<i>And if I don't get the Duke back
in the next two hours</i>

1570
01:42:47,342 --> 01:42:50,346
I'm gonna turn those disks over
to the feds. You hear me?

1571
01:42:50,553 --> 01:42:52,726
<i>You tell Serrano
I want to meet him with the Duke</i>

1572
01:42:52,931 --> 01:42:54,854
<i>alone in two hours in the main
terminal of McCarran Airport</i>

1573
01:42:55,058 --> 01:42:56,310
where we'll make the exchange.

1574
01:42:56,476 --> 01:42:57,978
I know he's the only one
of you fucking idiots

1575
01:42:58,186 --> 01:42:59,358
who won't try to take a shot at me
in a public place,

1576
01:42:59,562 --> 01:43:02,692
and if I see one fuckin' single goon
within a mile of that airport...

1577
01:43:03,067 --> 01:43:04,614
<i>Now listen to me very carefully...</i>

1578
01:43:04,819 --> 01:43:06,742
...the deal is off,
and I'm going to the feds.

1579
01:43:06,946 --> 01:43:09,040
I ain't gonna bother Jimmy
with your bullshit.

1580
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:11,868
You're not? Okay, fine. Fine.
After he's busted

1581
01:43:12,076 --> 01:43:14,455
I'll make sure to let him know
you knew all about it beforehand.

1582
01:43:14,871 --> 01:43:18,171
<i>That's two hours from now.
Main terminal, McCarran Airport.</i>

1583
01:43:18,416 --> 01:43:20,760
You got that, moron? Have a nice day.

1584
01:43:27,551 --> 01:43:29,429
Tell Alonzo I want to make a deal.

1585
01:43:44,319 --> 01:43:45,741
You want to make a deal with me?

1586
01:43:45,946 --> 01:43:48,074
What would you do
if I could deliver you Serrano?

1587
01:43:50,409 --> 01:43:51,581
What do you mean, "deliver"?

1588
01:43:51,785 --> 01:43:54,459
For starters, conspiracy to destroy
government evidence.

1589
01:43:54,664 --> 01:43:56,041
What government evidence?

1590
01:43:56,207 --> 01:43:58,926
Will you let me take the Duke back
myself and collect my money?

1591
01:44:08,679 --> 01:44:09,601
Tell me more.

1592
01:44:09,805 --> 01:44:10,897
I'll have to tell you on the way

1593
01:44:11,098 --> 01:44:12,566
'cause we gotta be
in Las Vegas in two hours.

1594
01:44:30,202 --> 01:44:31,499
[JON]: Marvin?

1595
01:44:32,829 --> 01:44:35,504
- Marvin?
- No, it's room service.

1596
01:44:46,510 --> 01:44:47,978
Here. Hold this up...

1597
01:44:48,597 --> 01:44:50,645
so they know I took this today.

1598
01:44:51,683 --> 01:44:54,277
I amaze myself. I'm always thinking.

1599
01:44:55,854 --> 01:44:57,481
Got it all figured out.

1600
01:44:58,023 --> 01:45:00,947
- Now say, "Cheese."
- Don't do this, Marvin.

1601
01:45:03,821 --> 01:45:05,243
<i>Adios.</i>

1602
01:45:08,451 --> 01:45:10,453
All right.
There are no real computer disks.

1603
01:45:10,703 --> 01:45:12,330
- Is that right?
- Right.

1604
01:45:12,538 --> 01:45:14,085
So if you give him blank disks...

1605
01:45:14,290 --> 01:45:17,511
and he accepts them would that
still be considered an overt act?

1606
01:45:17,711 --> 01:45:19,384
If he just sets foot
inside the airport

1607
01:45:19,588 --> 01:45:22,592
he's committed an overt act,
conspiracy to obstruct justice.

1608
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:25,098
When he shows up with the Duke,
you add kidnapping.

1609
01:45:25,344 --> 01:45:27,517
Anybody packing a gun,
conspiracy to commit murder.

1610
01:45:27,721 --> 01:45:29,144
The fact that it's an airport,

1611
01:45:29,349 --> 01:45:30,851
and Alonzo, correct me
if you think I'm wrong here.

1612
01:45:31,059 --> 01:45:32,151
I don't want to
step on your toes.

1613
01:45:32,352 --> 01:45:33,979
You can slap an interstate
transportation aid

1614
01:45:34,187 --> 01:45:35,939
or racketeering rap
on him right away as well.

1615
01:45:37,399 --> 01:45:39,026
Yeah, well none of that
bullshit means anything

1616
01:45:39,234 --> 01:45:41,157
unless you can get him
to take those disks from you.

1617
01:45:41,319 --> 01:45:44,039
Don't worry.
I'll get him to take the disks.

1618
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:45,913
Get a wire on this man.

1619
01:45:56,211 --> 01:45:58,009
Marvin.

1620
01:46:00,048 --> 01:46:03,518
No hard feelings about
what happened back in Amarillo, huh?

1621
01:46:07,556 --> 01:46:10,936
Just one of those
spur-of-the-moment deals, you know?

1622
01:46:11,311 --> 01:46:13,780
- Where is he?
- Where's the money?

1623
01:46:14,272 --> 01:46:15,819
In the car. Where is he?

1624
01:46:19,110 --> 01:46:22,581
Slight change of plans.
Now I want $2 million.

1625
01:46:22,781 --> 01:46:23,452
What?

1626
01:46:23,657 --> 01:46:25,204
I read the newspapers, you know?

1627
01:46:25,409 --> 01:46:27,377
The guy got you
for $15 million, right?

1628
01:46:27,536 --> 01:46:30,130
So I figure he's gotta be worth
at least $2 million.

1629
01:46:31,415 --> 01:46:33,088
I'm a businessman.

1630
01:46:34,710 --> 01:46:36,588
How do we know you got him?

1631
01:46:44,346 --> 01:46:45,973
I want $1 million now...

1632
01:46:46,639 --> 01:46:48,516
and I'll call you in 20 minutes,

1633
01:46:48,725 --> 01:46:51,445
tell you where to drop off
the second million.

1634
01:46:51,645 --> 01:46:54,694
Once I know it's there,
then I'll tell you where he is.

1635
01:46:55,900 --> 01:46:57,652
Okay?

1636
01:46:58,486 --> 01:47:00,614
- Not okay.
- Why not?

1637
01:47:06,119 --> 01:47:07,962
What are you, fucking nuts?
What's Jimmy gonna say?

1638
01:47:08,121 --> 01:47:09,623
How the fuck we gonna get the Duke now?

1639
01:47:09,873 --> 01:47:11,125
You got the answer
right in your hand!

1640
01:47:11,333 --> 01:47:12,710
What are you talkin' about?

1641
01:47:13,627 --> 01:47:15,926
Joey, when are you gonna learn
how to pay attention?

1642
01:47:16,422 --> 01:47:18,845
Look. See what it says there?

1643
01:47:23,763 --> 01:47:24,889
All right. This is it.

1644
01:47:25,098 --> 01:47:27,601
Tonight is the fucking night.
You understand?

1645
01:47:27,809 --> 01:47:29,608
I'm sick of all of these screw-ups.

1646
01:47:29,770 --> 01:47:32,068
As soon as I get the disks from Walsh,

1647
01:47:32,356 --> 01:47:35,576
you guys drop Walsh
and you drop the Duke. Do you understand?

1648
01:47:35,776 --> 01:47:38,575
I get the disks, you drop them. Okay?

1649
01:47:39,196 --> 01:47:41,619
- I don't think you should do this.
- Oh, really?

1650
01:47:41,949 --> 01:47:43,543
What do you propose that I do?

1651
01:47:43,743 --> 01:47:46,166
Send somebody with a cash offer,
but don't do this.

1652
01:47:46,413 --> 01:47:48,507
I know Walsh.
He won't take any money from me.

1653
01:47:48,748 --> 01:47:50,375
He's a very self-righteous
type of guy.

1654
01:47:50,542 --> 01:47:51,759
It aggravates me.

1655
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:53,132
In his mind, this is clean.

1656
01:47:53,336 --> 01:47:55,259
He gets what he wants,
I get what I want.

1657
01:47:55,422 --> 01:47:57,676
- The guy's a fuckin' burnout, Sidney.
- Hey, Jimmy...

1658
01:47:57,883 --> 01:48:01,979
Sidney, sit down, relax, have a sandwich, drink
a glass of milk. Do some fuckin' thing, will 'ya.

1659
01:48:20,073 --> 01:48:21,370
He's on his way.

1660
01:48:35,590 --> 01:48:37,468
<i>[Agent]: He's heading north
on Las Vegas Boulevard,</i>

1661
01:48:37,718 --> 01:48:40,722
<i>approximately two miles
from the airport. We're right on him.</i>

1662
01:48:40,929 --> 01:48:42,397
Why are you smiling?

1663
01:48:43,432 --> 01:48:45,275
I feel like a cop again.

1664
01:49:38,241 --> 01:49:40,960
So I'm finally in the
presence of greatness, huh?

1665
01:49:41,661 --> 01:49:42,833
The Duke.

1666
01:49:44,122 --> 01:49:46,170
The guy that steals money
from the scum of the earth

1667
01:49:46,375 --> 01:49:49,003
and gives it to the unfortunates
of the world.

1668
01:49:49,211 --> 01:49:51,259
I wanted to meet you face to face.

1669
01:49:57,387 --> 01:50:00,436
Did you actually think that
you were gonna steal my money

1670
01:50:00,640 --> 01:50:02,392
and get away with it?

1671
01:50:04,352 --> 01:50:06,821
I stopped by here
to tell you two things:

1672
01:50:07,689 --> 01:50:10,158
Number one is that
you're gonna die tonight.

1673
01:50:11,026 --> 01:50:15,827
Number two: I'm gonna go home,
have a nice hot meal...

1674
01:50:17,157 --> 01:50:21,003
...I'm gonna find your wife,
and I'm gonna kill her, too.

1675
01:50:30,213 --> 01:50:32,591
Joey, wait here for my call.
The rest of you start going in.

1676
01:50:32,799 --> 01:50:34,051
You got it.

1677
01:50:50,861 --> 01:50:52,204
Here he comes.

1678
01:51:02,456 --> 01:51:05,631
Jack. Long time no see.

1679
01:51:06,085 --> 01:51:07,428
Long time no see.

1680
01:51:07,712 --> 01:51:10,135
I see you're still spendin'
all your money on clothes.

1681
01:51:10,340 --> 01:51:13,310
- You know...
- Listen, while you're in town

1682
01:51:13,468 --> 01:51:16,688
<i>if you want to go see a show
or you want a free meal or something</i>

1683
01:51:16,929 --> 01:51:18,728
<i>like that you just
let me know, all right? On me.</i>

1684
01:51:18,974 --> 01:51:20,317
That's the type of guy I am.

1685
01:51:20,476 --> 01:51:21,978
You're a real sport.

1686
01:51:22,311 --> 01:51:24,234
Just give him the disks.

1687
01:51:24,647 --> 01:51:26,149
How's your mother?

1688
01:51:27,858 --> 01:51:29,155
She's all right.

1689
01:51:29,401 --> 01:51:31,404
Daughter's gettin' big, growing up.

1690
01:51:36,368 --> 01:51:39,838
You know, I was thinkin' maybe if we
would've clone business way back when,

1691
01:51:40,038 --> 01:51:43,133
you wouldn't look like a guy
with a fucking cup in your hand.

1692
01:51:44,209 --> 01:51:46,053
- I'm tryin' to make a living.
- Yeah.

1693
01:51:46,337 --> 01:51:47,964
Listen, Jack, you got those disks

1694
01:51:48,172 --> 01:51:50,766
or did you lose them
like you lost your job?

1695
01:51:54,428 --> 01:51:56,271
Give him the disks, Walsh.

1696
01:51:57,515 --> 01:51:59,564
I see you, but I don't see the Duke.

1697
01:51:59,810 --> 01:52:03,485
- We'll worry about him in a minute.
- We gotta worry about him now.

1698
01:52:05,649 --> 01:52:08,778
Let me tell you somethin', Jimmy.
This isn't a reunion.

1699
01:52:09,152 --> 01:52:13,158
If I don't see the Duke
in about five seconds, I'm walking.

1700
01:52:14,242 --> 01:52:16,586
You know,
you're still way too serious.

1701
01:52:16,786 --> 01:52:19,756
Really. Listen.
Why don't you just hand over the tapes,

1702
01:52:19,956 --> 01:52:21,378
we'll take a walk,
we'll go get the guy together.

1703
01:52:21,541 --> 01:52:23,543
Fuck you.
I'll see you at the arraignment.

1704
01:52:23,751 --> 01:52:25,550
Hey, Jack, Jack. Hey.

1705
01:52:25,838 --> 01:52:27,431
Where the hell is he goin'?

1706
01:52:27,631 --> 01:52:28,848
You win, all right?

1707
01:52:29,049 --> 01:52:29,800
- I what?
- You won.

1708
01:52:30,008 --> 01:52:32,602
What do you want me to do,
yell it all over this fucking airport?

1709
01:52:34,430 --> 01:52:35,647
Where is he?

1710
01:52:39,561 --> 01:52:42,314
- He's on his way.
- You know I said no goons.

1711
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:44,699
Never mind him.
You're gonna get what you want.

1712
01:52:44,899 --> 01:52:46,151
Didn't I just tell you that?

1713
01:52:46,359 --> 01:52:48,532
This thing is gonna give me
a heart attack before it's all over.

1714
01:52:48,737 --> 01:52:50,535
I know I'm gonna
get a heart attack.

1715
01:53:02,710 --> 01:53:04,758
Since we have this moment
to share together

1716
01:53:04,962 --> 01:53:06,715
there's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

1717
01:53:10,218 --> 01:53:14,849
Doesn't it bother you that another
copper is fuckin' your wife?

1718
01:53:17,309 --> 01:53:19,733
Do you know
they made this guy a captain?

1719
01:53:20,980 --> 01:53:24,575
Can you imagine that?
Go figure it out. Made him a captain.

1720
01:53:32,534 --> 01:53:35,583
- Can I help you, sir?
- Give me a one-way ticket to LA.

1721
01:53:35,788 --> 01:53:37,711
One-way ticket to Los Angeles.

1722
01:53:39,416 --> 01:53:41,589
Will that be smoking or non-smoking?

1723
01:53:41,877 --> 01:53:43,504
Take a wild guess.

1724
01:53:44,463 --> 01:53:46,341
Smoking.

1725
01:53:56,684 --> 01:53:59,313
And how will you
be paying for this, sir?

1726
01:54:08,030 --> 01:54:09,077
- Oh shit.
- What?

1727
01:54:09,281 --> 01:54:10,578
Look.

1728
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:18,587
What the hell is he doing here?

1729
01:54:18,792 --> 01:54:21,170
Alright, we have a male Caucasian
carrying a green duffel bag

1730
01:54:21,378 --> 01:54:23,801
with his hands inside his vest
approaching the subjects.

1731
01:54:24,005 --> 01:54:26,850
Get him out of there as quickly
and as quietly as possible.

1732
01:54:27,051 --> 01:54:29,975
Shoot him if you have to,
but get him out of here.

1733
01:54:31,848 --> 01:54:33,100
- You okay, Jon?
- Yeah.

1734
01:54:33,391 --> 01:54:35,985
- Stand behind me.
- It's all right.

1735
01:54:37,436 --> 01:54:38,938
Alright, come on.

1736
01:54:41,149 --> 01:54:43,368
- Hey, how's everybody doin'?
- Get out of here, Marvin.

1737
01:54:43,527 --> 01:54:44,995
Back off, everybody. Back off.

1738
01:54:45,195 --> 01:54:47,744
- Who the fuck are you?
- What, are you writin' a book? Who the fuck are you?

1739
01:54:47,948 --> 01:54:49,245
Who is this guy?

1740
01:54:49,449 --> 01:54:50,701
Jesus.

1741
01:54:50,909 --> 01:54:52,377
Marvin, Marvin. You're missin'
the bigger picture here.

1742
01:54:52,537 --> 01:54:53,789
I'm telling you, get out of here.

1743
01:54:54,205 --> 01:54:55,627
Wire's gone dead.

1744
01:54:55,832 --> 01:54:56,879
Are you crazy?

1745
01:54:57,125 --> 01:54:59,298
I didn't come all
this way for nothin'.

1746
01:55:01,170 --> 01:55:02,717
- Serrano's leaving.
- Did he take the disks?

1747
01:55:02,964 --> 01:55:04,341
I don't know.

1748
01:55:04,841 --> 01:55:06,719
- Serrano's got the disks.
- Let him go, Jack.

1749
01:55:06,927 --> 01:55:09,021
Serrano's got the disks.

1750
01:55:09,221 --> 01:55:10,564
Did he or did he not take the disks?

1751
01:55:10,764 --> 01:55:12,732
I couldn't tell.
There's too much goin' on down there.

1752
01:55:15,144 --> 01:55:17,772
Serrano's got the disks.
He's got the disks.

1753
01:55:20,150 --> 01:55:21,823
Marvin! Marvin, Marvin, look out!

1754
01:55:22,027 --> 01:55:23,404
Marvin, Marvin, Marvin, look out!

1755
01:55:23,612 --> 01:55:25,706
If you think I'm fallin' for
that shit again you're crazy.

1756
01:55:25,989 --> 01:55:29,334
Marvin! Marvin, look out!
You stupid fuck, will you look out!

1757
01:55:29,618 --> 01:55:32,246
Serrano's got the disks!
Serrano's got the disks!

1758
01:55:32,747 --> 01:55:34,374
Move in.

1759
01:55:34,540 --> 01:55:36,383
[all shouting]

1760
01:55:42,882 --> 01:55:45,055
Take it easy! Come on!

1761
01:55:46,052 --> 01:55:49,023
Ow! Goddamn it!
Who the fuck are you guys?

1762
01:55:53,560 --> 01:55:57,736
Jimmy, there's somethin' I've been
wanting to say to you for ten years.

1763
01:55:57,940 --> 01:56:00,319
- Oh, yeah? What's that?
- You're under arrest.

1764
01:56:01,527 --> 01:56:03,404
We'll catch up with each other
one of these days.

1765
01:56:03,613 --> 01:56:05,411
Maybe we will.

1766
01:56:06,824 --> 01:56:09,077
- We still got our deal?
- We got our deal.

1767
01:56:09,285 --> 01:56:12,789
Hey, wait a minute! What deal?
Why the fuck does he get special treatment?

1768
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:14,462
See you in LA, Marvin.

1769
01:56:14,667 --> 01:56:17,136
Watch your cigarettes
with this guy, Jack.

1770
01:56:18,253 --> 01:56:19,630
<i>What's gain' on?</i>

1771
01:56:19,838 --> 01:56:22,682
Sorry, Jon. I got an hour and a half
to get you back to LA.

1772
01:56:22,883 --> 01:56:24,135
Thanks, Alonzo.

1773
01:58:06,244 --> 01:58:07,962
[phone rings]

1774
01:58:08,163 --> 01:58:09,631
Yeah, Moscone's Bail Bonds.

1775
01:58:10,082 --> 01:58:12,255
- Hello, Eddie. Where's Jerry?
- Yeah?

1776
01:58:12,459 --> 01:58:14,588
Never mind Jerry.
Where the hell are you, Jack?

1777
01:58:14,796 --> 01:58:16,673
Feds picked him up 20 minutes ago.

1778
01:58:16,923 --> 01:58:18,846
- Yeah, what for?
- What's the difference, man?

1779
01:58:19,050 --> 01:58:20,802
I never trusted that guy anyway.

1780
01:58:21,010 --> 01:58:24,059
- Where the hell are you?
- Where am I? I'm at the airport.

1781
01:58:24,263 --> 01:58:26,391
And guess who I'm with?
I'm with the Duke.

1782
01:58:26,557 --> 01:58:30,358
You got him! You got him, Jack!
I love you!

1783
01:58:30,521 --> 01:58:33,240
- You want to say hello?
- Yeah. Put him on.

1784
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:34,908
- Say hello.
- Hello.

1785
01:58:35,109 --> 01:58:37,157
Hello, you son of a bitch!

1786
01:58:37,569 --> 01:58:38,445
<i>We got you.</i>

1787
01:58:38,612 --> 01:58:40,205
<i>You son of a bitch!</i>

1788
01:58:40,447 --> 01:58:42,325
Now say goodbye,
you lying little piece of shit,

1789
01:58:42,534 --> 01:58:43,911
because I'm letting him go.

1790
01:58:44,119 --> 01:58:45,871
Jack?

1791
01:58:51,918 --> 01:58:53,966
Would've been a nice coffee shop.

1792
01:58:55,965 --> 01:58:59,560
Oh, Jesus. Oh.

1793
01:59:01,512 --> 01:59:02,764
I don't get it.

1794
01:59:03,806 --> 01:59:05,353
I did what I wanted to do, Jon.

1795
01:59:05,558 --> 01:59:07,527
I got you to LA
before midnight, so...

1796
01:59:15,944 --> 01:59:17,571
I don't know what to say.

1797
01:59:18,238 --> 01:59:19,455
Don't say anything.

1798
01:59:19,614 --> 01:59:22,664
Knowing you, you'll make me want
to put those back on you again.

1799
01:59:24,036 --> 01:59:25,253
Thanks.

1800
01:59:25,454 --> 01:59:27,957
- No, Jon, thank you.
- Thank you.

1801
01:59:34,255 --> 01:59:36,634
Somethin' to remember
our adventure by.

1802
01:59:40,554 --> 01:59:42,147
Jack.

1803
01:59:50,690 --> 01:59:52,112
This better be good.

1804
01:59:54,027 --> 01:59:55,370
This is good.

1805
01:59:56,779 --> 01:59:58,622
This is very good.

1806
02:00:03,495 --> 02:00:04,838
When I was makin' my getaway,

1807
02:00:05,039 --> 02:00:07,007
I thought the FBI
was closin' in on me.

1808
02:00:07,208 --> 02:00:10,337
Take it, take it.
I took some traveling money.

1809
02:00:10,502 --> 02:00:12,049
Take it, take it.

1810
02:00:14,048 --> 02:00:18,225
It's not a payoff. It's a gift.
You already let me go.

1811
02:00:20,555 --> 02:00:22,228
You son of a bitch.

1812
02:00:23,266 --> 02:00:25,985
- You son of a bitch.
- Told you I had money.

1813
02:00:26,186 --> 02:00:29,282
I know you had money,
but I didn't know you had money.

1814
02:00:38,407 --> 02:00:39,704
How much is here?

1815
02:00:40,243 --> 02:00:41,996
Neighborhood of $300,000.

1816
02:00:44,039 --> 02:00:48,545
That's a... that's a very
respectable neighborhood.

1817
02:00:54,091 --> 02:00:55,935
I don't know what to say, Jon.

1818
02:00:57,637 --> 02:00:59,310
Take care.
