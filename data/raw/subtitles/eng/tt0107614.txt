00:00:16,523 --> 00:00:20,403
Figaro, Figaro, Figaro,
Figaro, Figaro, Figaro,

00:00:20,476 --> 00:00:23,049
Figaro, Figaro, Figaro,
Figaro, Figaro, Figaro.

00:00:23,332 --> 00:00:24,525
Figaro!

5
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:25,959
Son qua.

6
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:27,862
Hey, Figaro!

7
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:28,889
Son qua.

8
00:00:28,942 --> 00:00:32,182
Figaro qua, Figaro là,
Figaro qua, Figaro là,

00:00:32,222 --> 00:00:35,529
Figaro su, Figaro giù,
Figaro su, Figaro giù.

10
00:00:35,592 --> 00:00:38,705
Pronto prontissimo, son come il fulmine,
sono il factotum della città.

11
00:00:38,765 --> 00:00:42,601
Della città, della città,
della città, della città.

12
00:00:43,148 --> 00:00:44,508
Phew!

13
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:51,176
Ah bravo Figaro, bravo bravissimo,
ah bravo Figaro, bravo bravissimo.

14
00:00:51,203 --> 00:00:54,136
A te fortuna, a te fortuna,
a te fortuna non mancherà.

La la la la la la, la la la la la la,
la la la la la la, la la la la.

16
00:00:57,466 --> 00:01:00,732
A te fortuna, a te fortuna,
a te fortuna non mancherà.

17
00:01:00,866 --> 00:01:03,946
Sono il factotum della città.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,963
Sono il factotum della città.

19
00:01:07,023 --> 00:01:10,399
Della città, della città.

20
00:01:10,472 --> 00:01:16,500
Della città.

21
00:01:17,488 --> 00:01:18,575
Oops!

22
00:01:18,832 --> 00:01:21,442
Salutations, snack.

23
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:22,656
Yipe.

24
00:01:22,752 --> 00:01:24,202
On second thought...

25
00:01:24,262 --> 00:01:26,542
Yiiipe!

26
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,993
9-1-1!
9-1-1!

27
00:01:29,073 --> 00:01:32,747
Police! Civic authorities!
ASPCA! ASAP!

28
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,276
Murder! Betrayal!
Kidnapped!

29
00:01:35,309 --> 00:01:37,070
No, birdnapped!

30
00:01:37,949 --> 00:01:40,878
A cup of garlic,
a twist of parakeet.

31
00:01:40,914 --> 00:01:43,863
Eat your heart out, Julia Child.

32
00:01:44,057 --> 00:01:45,363
Excuse me.

33
00:01:45,537 --> 00:01:50,048
But isn't it customary for the jailbird
to get one telephone call?

34
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:51,873
In your case, I think not.

35
00:01:52,032 --> 00:01:54,559
Afternoon snacks have few civil liberties.

36
00:01:54,627 --> 00:01:56,990
But I'm not wholly without heart.

37
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:59,527
How about a nice soothing cigarette?

38
00:02:02,097 --> 00:02:05,097
Pah! Pah!
Pah! Agh!

39
00:02:05,176 --> 00:02:05,976
Ugh!

40
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:08,622
Oh, I will not do this.
I cannot!

41
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:13,277
Oh, what a foul way for a bird to die!
I don't want to get beak cancer.

42
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,679
No! My lungs are blackened!

43
00:02:15,726 --> 00:02:18,579
Here we go again.
Cut, cut, cut! Roll it back.

44
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:21,179
- Help me...
- What are you doing? Daniel...

45
00:02:21,257 --> 00:02:24,127
That line is not in the script.
Why did you add it?

46
00:02:24,213 --> 00:02:26,787
Well, I thought I should
comment on the situation.

47
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:28,153
What situation?

48
00:02:28,196 --> 00:02:30,952
The fact that Pudgie the parrot has
a cigarette shoved into his mouth

49
00:02:30,986 --> 00:02:33,766
- is morally irresponsible.
- This is a cartoon, okay?

50
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:35,980
This is not a friggin'
Oprah Winfrey Special.

51
00:02:36,006 --> 00:02:37,789
Lou, millions of kids see this cartoon.

52
00:02:37,836 --> 00:02:40,229
It's like sending each one of them
a pack of cigarettes and saying "Light up."

53
00:02:40,276 --> 00:02:43,906
You can't put words in Pudgie's mouth
if his mouth isn't moving.

54
00:02:43,966 --> 00:02:45,949
Well, it's voice-over.
An interior monologue.

55
00:02:46,002 --> 00:02:47,836
Maybe even the voice of God.

56
00:02:47,887 --> 00:02:50,787
Pudgie, don't smoke.

57
00:02:50,856 --> 00:02:52,632
- Actors.
- What?

58
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:54,352
Well, let's ask the technicians.

59
00:02:54,386 --> 00:02:57,599
You think it's morally right to promote
smoking to the youth of America?

60
00:03:00,988 --> 00:03:02,668
They're biased.
That's a mistrial.

61
00:03:02,768 --> 00:03:03,808
Daniel, listen to me.

62
00:03:03,861 --> 00:03:06,194
This session is costing the studio
thousands of dollars.

63
00:03:06,241 --> 00:03:08,734
Now, if you want a paycheck,
stick to the script.

64
00:03:08,774 --> 00:03:12,204
If you want to play Gandhi,
then do it on somebody else's time.

65
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:21,485
Then I've got to do
what I've got to do.

66
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:24,691
That's pretty funny.
Where the hell are you goin'?

67
00:03:24,898 --> 00:03:27,930
Hey, listen buddy. I'll tell you something.
If you leave, you're not comin' back in.

68
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,914
I'm not takin' any crap from you, pal.

69
00:03:30,694 --> 00:03:33,657
Well, in the words of Porky Pig:

70
00:03:33,817 --> 00:03:38,384
P-P-P-P... P-P-P-P-P
Piss off, Lou.

71
00:04:10,963 --> 00:04:13,793
- So what about that history test?
- Don't ask.

72
00:04:14,303 --> 00:04:16,779
- Did you have fun in school?
- I painted a picture...

73
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,939
- Oh, yeah?
- of a...  of a rainbow.

74
00:04:21,607 --> 00:04:22,487
- Dad?
- Dad?

75
00:04:22,547 --> 00:04:23,561
Daddy!

76
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,467
Daddy!

77
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,347
Yow!

78
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:29,662
Oh!

79
00:04:30,882 --> 00:04:33,835
- I thought you couldn't pick us up.
- Well, I got off early.

80
00:04:34,647 --> 00:04:36,667
- You mean you got fired?
- No, I quit.

81
00:04:37,168 --> 00:04:38,748
For reasons of conscience.

82
00:04:38,954 --> 00:04:40,027
Actors?

83
00:04:40,066 --> 00:04:41,593
Hey dude!

84
00:04:41,653 --> 00:04:44,867
Congratulations on
your 12th birthday, all right.

85
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:46,503
Got a surprise for you.

86
00:04:46,696 --> 00:04:48,369
- A stripper?
- Ooh, please!

87
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:50,483
- Two strippers?
- Hoo-hah, boy!

88
00:04:50,603 --> 00:04:51,976
- A party?
- Yes!

89
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:52,850
- No.
- Yes.

90
00:04:52,903 --> 00:04:54,322
- Yes.
- No parties.

91
00:04:54,472 --> 00:04:57,097
Mom said you couldn't have one
because of your report card.

92
00:04:57,887 --> 00:05:01,567
Mom's not gonna be home
for another four hours, is she?

93
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:08,694
Prepare yourself...
for the wild kingdom. Huh?

94
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,913
What?
No, no, no.

95
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,970
Coming up toward the very end.
There she goes. And she wins that race.

96
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,033
Come on off now.
Here we go. Ohh!

97
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,080
You want to feed him?

98
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,116
Look!
See if this guy will.

99
00:05:42,183 --> 00:05:43,223
Want some?

100
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,249
Oops, oops.
Sorry.

101
00:05:46,043 --> 00:05:47,003
Shoo!

102
00:05:47,582 --> 00:05:48,682
Get out!

103
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:53,433
Shoo!
Shoo!

104
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:19,518
<i>- Gregory, Henderson and Hillard.</i>
- Miranda Hillard, please.

105
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:23,765
I know what you're going for
with these murals,

106
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:25,818
but perhaps if they weren't so large.

107
00:06:26,045 --> 00:06:28,782
And let's do steel windows, not wood.

108
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:29,605
Uh huh.

109
00:06:29,658 --> 00:06:33,188
Eliminate the Oriental rug.
Let's try an Aubusson carpet.

110
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:34,892
More pink than red.

111
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,266
- I like that.
- Good idea.

112
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:38,635
Union Square Inn.
Ah, this is better.

113
00:06:38,755 --> 00:06:41,989
More Arts and Crafts.
A Dirk Van Erp lamp, a Stickley chair.

114
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:43,676
Don't be seduced by chintz.

115
00:06:43,808 --> 00:06:46,464
Excuse me. Miranda,
can I speak to you for a minute?

116
00:06:46,558 --> 00:06:48,978
- Yes. Excuse me.
- Certainly.

117
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:51,138
Just be one minute.

118
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:55,161
I just got off the phone
with a Stuart Dunmeyer.

119
00:06:55,318 --> 00:06:57,257
- Stuart Dunmeyer?
- Uh huh.

120
00:06:57,378 --> 00:06:58,825
He said you were acquaintances.

121
00:06:58,987 --> 00:07:02,028
- Stuart Dunmeyer?
- Yeah. He's putting millions of dollars

122
00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:04,571
into restoring that old
Wellman mansion on Nob Hill.

123
00:07:04,627 --> 00:07:07,710
He wants to make it into
a $500-a-night B&B.

124
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,650
Yes, I read about it.

125
00:07:09,723 --> 00:07:12,797
- He's been doing very well.
- Uh huh. That's him.

126
00:07:12,937 --> 00:07:16,091
And he specifically asked for you, Miranda.

127
00:07:16,506 --> 00:07:17,734
- He did?
- Yep.

128
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,320
So, I told him you'd get in touch
with him first thing tomorrow.

129
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,489
Yes, I will.

130
00:07:22,235 --> 00:07:23,135
Miss Hillard?

131
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:25,918
The operator has a Gloria Chaney on hold.

132
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,772
- She says it's an emergency.
- Excuse me.

133
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,120
Gloria?

134
00:07:44,436 --> 00:07:47,306
- Oh, my God!
- Is this your residence, ma'am?

135
00:07:47,406 --> 00:07:49,426
Yes.
I'm sorry to say it is.

136
00:07:49,498 --> 00:07:51,162
Are you aware that
it's illegal to possess

137
00:07:51,195 --> 00:07:53,961
animals of the barnyard nature
in a residential area, ma'am?

138
00:07:54,001 --> 00:07:55,381
What if you're married to one?

139
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,808
Also, we're responding to
a noise ordinance violation.

140
00:07:57,885 --> 00:07:59,577
Believe, I'm going to respond myself.

141
00:07:59,624 --> 00:08:01,985
I'm awfully sorry about this.
I'll get back with you.

142
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,345
You ate my begonias!
God!

143
00:08:05,581 --> 00:08:06,784
Get out of my way!

144
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:42,498
Oh, shoo!
Get! Get!

145
00:09:04,468 --> 00:09:05,268
Hah!

146
00:09:06,283 --> 00:09:08,804
Miranda!
Whassup?

147
00:09:09,284 --> 00:09:11,119
You're home early, girlfriend.

148
00:09:11,753 --> 00:09:13,813
Havin' a birthday in the house.

149
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,909
What the hell is going on around here?

150
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,439
Don't get mad, honey.
Listen.

151
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:20,956
You're home a little early.

152
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,849
I-I was gonna have everything
clean up before you got home.

153
00:09:27,263 --> 00:09:28,139
Honey...

154
00:09:28,353 --> 00:09:30,269
What-what?
Honey, what are you looking for?

155
00:09:30,939 --> 00:09:34,119
Honey, I-I'd be careful.
That pony had a lot of water.

156
00:09:34,346 --> 00:09:35,193
Ugh!

157
00:09:43,431 --> 00:09:44,654
Party's over.

158
00:09:48,807 --> 00:09:52,451
Oh, that's great. She called you,
you bust the birthday party. That's great!

159
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:55,191
Don't you dare make me out
to be the monster here, Daniel!

160
00:09:55,238 --> 00:09:56,285
Don't you dare!

161
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:59,071
You have all the fun and
I get whatever's left over.

162
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:00,528
Oh, you chose the career, Mrs...

163
00:10:00,595 --> 00:10:03,362
I have no choices here, Daniel.
I have no choices!

164
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:07,060
Even when I try to do something fun,
you have to do it ten times bigger!

165
00:10:07,093 --> 00:10:08,876
I bring home a birthday cake
and a few gifts,

166
00:10:08,936 --> 00:10:12,326
You bring home the goddamn San Diego Zoo
and I have to clean up after!

167
00:10:12,366 --> 00:10:15,185
Oh, I'm sorry. But, it's not toxic waste,
just a few party plates, huh!

168
00:10:15,211 --> 00:10:18,040
Why am I the only one
that feels there has to be rules?

169
00:10:18,213 --> 00:10:20,603
Why do you always
make me out to be the heavy?

170
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:23,621
Well, I don't make you to be anything.
You do it yourself quite naturally.

171
00:10:23,654 --> 00:10:25,681
- You set me up, Daniel, every time...
- I don't.

172
00:10:25,715 --> 00:10:27,625
- to be the bad guy.
- Oh, lighten up, will you?

173
00:10:27,678 --> 00:10:30,545
Just realize you're spending
too much time with those corporate clones

174
00:10:30,591 --> 00:10:31,798
you used to despise.

175
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,800
I spend too much time with you, Daniel.
It's over!

176
00:10:34,861 --> 00:10:36,960
It's over.

177
00:10:38,801 --> 00:10:39,997
Come on, Miranda.

178
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:41,764
Listen, We've got problems,
but who doesn't?

179
00:10:41,804 --> 00:10:44,171
We could work 'em out.
What are you talking about, it's over?

180
00:10:44,204 --> 00:10:47,344
We've been trying to work them out
for 14 years.

181
00:10:47,558 --> 00:10:48,938
Come on, please.

182
00:10:48,998 --> 00:10:52,218
Listen.
Maybe, we need some help, OK?

183
00:10:52,644 --> 00:10:55,678
Maybe, we can go to a family therapist.
They'll help us pull through this together.

184
00:10:55,726 --> 00:10:57,636
It's too late for that.

185
00:10:57,922 --> 00:11:01,976
Well, let's take a vacation together
with the kids, as a family.

186
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,075
Get you away from work.

187
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,089
You're a different person,
you really are. You're great.

188
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:09,629
Oh, Daniel. Our problems would be
waiting for us when we got back.

189
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:13,129
We'll move, and hopefully
our damn problems won't follow us.

190
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,765
Daniel, please don't joke.

191
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,799
OK.

192
00:11:20,084 --> 00:11:25,037
We... We've just grown apart.
We're different.

193
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:30,127
- We have nothing in common.
- Oh, sure we do. We love each other.

194
00:11:35,577 --> 00:11:39,150
Come on, Miranda.
We love each other.

195
00:11:43,421 --> 00:11:44,851
Don't we?

196
00:11:49,788 --> 00:11:51,847
I want a divorce.

197
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:54,276
No.

198
00:12:01,412 --> 00:12:03,925
We can't.
We're a family.

199
00:12:04,026 --> 00:12:05,538
You know?

200
00:12:06,707 --> 00:12:08,565
I'm so sorry.

201
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:51,177
Yeah, Ma.
He told me all about it.

202
00:12:52,044 --> 00:12:54,591
Yeah, Ma.
I heard, I heard.

203
00:12:54,651 --> 00:12:55,993
<i>I want to talk to him.
What...</i>

204
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:59,035
- Well, yeah, he's here.
- No.

205
00:12:59,273 --> 00:13:00,120
<i>Frank?</i>

206
00:13:00,206 --> 00:13:01,853
Ma, he's not really in the mood to talk.

207
00:13:01,893 --> 00:13:03,025
<i>He's depressed or what?</i>

208
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:06,572
Yeah, depressed. You know?
I mean, his marriage is ending.

209
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:09,842
My marriage is not ending.
It's just on hiatus.

210
00:13:09,942 --> 00:13:13,155
<i>Talk to him. I mean I do.
I really want to talk to him.</i>

211
00:13:13,316 --> 00:13:15,686
Ma, I think he's in a little bit of denial.

212
00:13:15,786 --> 00:13:18,296
No, we're taking
good care of your little boy.

213
00:13:18,349 --> 00:13:19,502
Don't worry, Mom.

214
00:13:19,554 --> 00:13:22,696
- Hi, Evelyn. Thanks for the jam.
- She says you're welcome.

215
00:13:22,746 --> 00:13:23,932
Oh, I don't know.

216
00:13:23,972 --> 00:13:26,839
Uh, that beige concealer.
You know, when are we gettin' more of it?

217
00:13:26,892 --> 00:13:29,299
- Next week.
- You hear that, Ma? Next week.

218
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:30,980
<i>- Well, I'm so glad.</i>
- Wait, hang on.

219
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,616
- Enough already. It's a man.
- How would you know?

220
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,876
- Bitch.
<i>- This is your mother you're talking to.</i>

221
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,530
No, Ma, not you.
I was talkin' about the dog.

222
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:40,973
Ma, listen. Uh...

223
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:43,169
- We got people waiting for us on the set.
<i>- Same thing all the time.</i>

224
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:44,601
Oh, yeah.
It's a busy life, Ma.

225
00:13:44,628 --> 00:13:47,428
- Places to go, faces to paint.
<i>- I know. But, tell Daniel that I...</i>

226
00:13:47,484 --> 00:13:49,384
- Yeah, I'll tell him, Ma.
<i>- I wanted to come...</i>

227
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:51,372
- Don't worry, I'll tell him.
<i>- I would love it.</i>

228
00:13:51,424 --> 00:13:52,947
Yeah. Hold on, Ma.

229
00:13:53,014 --> 00:13:55,920
She wants to know
if you want to come stay with her.

230
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,630
No way.

231
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,850
He says he'll think about it, Ma.

232
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:02,923
- I will. All right. I love you, too.
<i>- Love you.</i>

233
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:05,093
- Bye, Ma.
<i>- Bye-bye.</i>

234
00:14:05,648 --> 00:14:09,558
Hey, listen, you know you could always
stay with us just as long as you want.

235
00:14:10,424 --> 00:14:12,487
Thank you. But I'm OK, really.

236
00:14:12,534 --> 00:14:15,034
I mean, this is...
this is just a temporary thing.

237
00:14:15,094 --> 00:14:18,180
I know Miranda.
It's gonna blow over.

238
00:14:22,382 --> 00:14:28,123
Mr and Mrs Hillard, although these custody
proceedings tend to favor the mother,

239
00:14:28,286 --> 00:14:31,326
we also realize,
perhaps now more than ever,

240
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,352
that it is not in a child's best interest

241
00:14:33,398 --> 00:14:37,445
to deprive him or her
of an obviously loving father.

242
00:14:38,434 --> 00:14:40,421
However, since at the present time

243
00:14:40,455 --> 00:14:44,468
Mr Hillard has no place to live
and no employment,...

244
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:49,502
it is the court's ruling
to award sole custody to Mrs Hillard.

245
00:14:49,612 --> 00:14:51,604
- Congratulations.
- No.

246
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:55,187
Mr Hillard will have
visitation rights every Saturday.

247
00:14:55,621 --> 00:14:57,947
- Can't you do something?
- He's made his decision.

248
00:14:58,001 --> 00:15:00,851
Isn't it traditional to say
"I object" or something?

249
00:15:01,351 --> 00:15:03,644
Your Honor, please.

250
00:15:04,464 --> 00:15:06,887
You mean, every Saturday?
That's one day a week.

251
00:15:06,961 --> 00:15:08,534
That's not enough.

252
00:15:09,107 --> 00:15:11,187
I have to be with my children.

253
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,460
It's not a question, really. I mean,
I have to be with them, sir. Please.

254
00:15:14,671 --> 00:15:18,161
I know it seems like a lot,
but for me it's not enough. Really.

255
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,741
I haven't been away from 'em

256
00:15:19,801 --> 00:15:22,694
for more than one day
since the day they were born.

257
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:26,211
Mr Hillard, I would like to add that
this ruling is only temporary.

258
00:15:26,251 --> 00:15:27,011
Oh, good.

259
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:30,017
I will assign a court liaison
to oversee your case.

260
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:33,127
And there will be a continuance
of these proceedings in 90 days.

261
00:15:33,594 --> 00:15:36,404
- I'm giving you three months, Mr Hillard.
- Thank you.

262
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:41,330
Three months in which to get a job,
keep it and create a suitable home.

263
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,091
If this proves to be a possibility for you,

264
00:15:44,231 --> 00:15:48,360
I will consider a joint-custody
arrangement when we reconvene.

265
00:15:48,507 --> 00:15:50,146
We're adjourned.

266
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:54,842
Well, it looks like there is a little light
at the end of our tunnel, heh?

267
00:16:25,394 --> 00:16:29,009
- That's all my stuff.
- This is all my fault.

268
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:31,908
God, no.
Why would you think that?

269
00:16:32,048 --> 00:16:34,538
I should have never had a birthday, Dad.

270
00:16:34,678 --> 00:16:37,548
- This never would have happened.
- Yes, it would.

271
00:16:37,678 --> 00:16:40,918
It was an accident waiting to happen, OK?

272
00:16:41,048 --> 00:16:43,549
You did nothing wrong.
You got that?

273
00:16:44,664 --> 00:16:46,724
OK, gimme five.

274
00:16:53,467 --> 00:16:55,487
You're the man of the house now.

275
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:57,687
Don't be messy.
OK?

276
00:16:58,868 --> 00:17:02,224
- You can't go now.
- Honey, I have to.

277
00:17:02,508 --> 00:17:07,277
We're in the middle of Charlotte's Web.
Who's gonna finish it?

278
00:17:07,947 --> 00:17:10,597
Well, Grandma will finish it for you.

279
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:13,257
She's not as good.

280
00:17:13,304 --> 00:17:17,384
She always skips parts,
and she never does the voices.

281
00:17:17,477 --> 00:17:19,437
She smells funny, too.

282
00:17:19,887 --> 00:17:24,416
That's the formaldehyde.
That's why Granny's so well preserved.

283
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,436
Hey, come here.

284
00:17:27,868 --> 00:17:29,481
Oh, oh.
Heh.

285
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:34,067
It's the same as always.
We just have a really big backyard, OK?

286
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:37,136
- I love you.
- I love you.

287
00:17:39,077 --> 00:17:40,184
OK.

288
00:17:40,362 --> 00:17:41,918
I'll miss you.

289
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:44,726
Saturday comes real quickly.

290
00:17:45,946 --> 00:17:47,409
I'll miss you.

291
00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:49,463
Ditto.

292
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,169
Oh, Dad...

293
00:17:53,836 --> 00:17:56,336
- Take care of her.
- OK.

294
00:17:57,955 --> 00:17:59,381
Goodbye.

295
00:18:05,435 --> 00:18:07,351
Thanks for the time, warden.

296
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:14,957
Bye, Dad.

297
00:18:35,427 --> 00:18:38,876
As your court liaison,
I will be looking at two things...

298
00:18:39,074 --> 00:18:43,273
- Your living environment...
- It's more like a habitat, really.

299
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:50,209
And I will be coming by on Monday
and Friday evenings to inspect it.

300
00:18:50,274 --> 00:18:52,244
Well, I'll put on a chicken.

301
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:55,104
Of course, there's always the job issue.

302
00:18:55,172 --> 00:18:57,742
This is the nearest employment office.

303
00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:00,822
I've taken the liberty of making
an appointment for you.

304
00:19:00,877 --> 00:19:01,667
Thank you.

305
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:04,800
Oh, by the way,
do you have any special skills?

306
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:06,420
Oh, yes. I do.

307
00:19:06,476 --> 00:19:08,496
I...I do voices.

308
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,836
What do you mean that you do voices?

309
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,898
Well, I do voices.

310
00:19:14,962 --> 00:19:15,831
Yes!

311
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,938
We're on this planet
looking for intelligent life.

312
00:19:17,985 --> 00:19:18,952
Oops, we made a mistake!

313
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:22,303
We're happy to be in America.
Don't ask for a green card.

314
00:19:22,365 --> 00:19:24,912
I want you in the worst way.

315
00:19:24,968 --> 00:19:26,468
Well, this is certainly a rough meeting.

316
00:19:26,501 --> 00:19:28,762
And it's not going very well for me,
I tell you that.

317
00:19:28,808 --> 00:19:32,451
Hey, boss, give her a chance.
She's gonna loosen up any moment.

318
00:19:32,531 --> 00:19:34,251
Look at me right now, Moneypenny.

319
00:19:34,384 --> 00:19:36,398
I want to undo that bow
and get to know you.

320
00:19:36,522 --> 00:19:39,122
I'm crazy to make a deal with you!

321
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:42,092
Nancy and I are still looking for
the other half of my head.

322
00:19:42,142 --> 00:19:46,005
They're doin' it!
I'm sittin' on a gold mine!

323
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,462
Don't make me smack you, sweetheart.
I ought to do it.

324
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,722
I do a great impression of a hot dog.

325
00:19:54,671 --> 00:19:57,271
Mr Hillard, do you
consider yourself humorous?

326
00:19:57,371 --> 00:19:59,127
I used to.

327
00:19:59,294 --> 00:20:02,672
There was a time when I found myself funny.

328
00:20:02,727 --> 00:20:05,912
But today you have proven me wrong.
Thank you.

329
00:20:08,221 --> 00:20:10,311
Listen, bottom line...

330
00:20:11,151 --> 00:20:13,067
I need to be with my children.

331
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,047
And I'll do anything to do that.

332
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,621
You just tell me what to do.

333
00:20:35,223 --> 00:20:36,330
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

334
00:20:36,397 --> 00:20:37,764
- You Tony?
- That's me.

335
00:20:37,843 --> 00:20:40,326
Hi. I'm Daniel Hillard, the actor.

336
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,726
Follow me.

337
00:20:46,961 --> 00:20:50,789
Oh, films! Will I be
introducing these movies on air?

338
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:53,359
- Not exactly.
- What do I do?

339
00:20:53,459 --> 00:20:56,689
Well, you take all these cans.
You box 'em and you ship 'em.

340
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,569
Then you box those cans over there.
Ship them. Then more of them will come in.

341
00:21:00,769 --> 00:21:03,400
You box those, you ship those.

342
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:04,728
Any questions?

343
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,219
After you box 'em...?

344
00:21:08,843 --> 00:21:10,353
You ship 'em.

345
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:13,139
Lots of luck, smartass.

346
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:18,418
I think I made a friend.

347
00:21:26,122 --> 00:21:27,262
Miranda.

348
00:21:28,209 --> 00:21:29,238
Stu!

349
00:21:34,398 --> 00:21:35,861
Hello, Miranda.

350
00:21:37,068 --> 00:21:39,738
- It's been a long time.
- Yes.

351
00:21:42,757 --> 00:21:46,813
Umm, Mr Dunmeyer's come by
to look over your sketches.

352
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:48,700
Umm.

353
00:21:48,918 --> 00:21:51,548
Let me show you to the conference room.

354
00:21:52,254 --> 00:21:55,487
As you probably know,
the estate was built in 1876.

355
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:59,866
Now, these sketches are meant to reflect
your desire to have it completely restored.

356
00:21:59,993 --> 00:22:01,959
You look better than ever.

357
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:04,677
The lobby will resemble a music salon

358
00:22:04,744 --> 00:22:07,831
with a great deal of inspiration
from the French Second Empire.

359
00:22:07,867 --> 00:22:10,767
I was thinking
a 17th-century grand piano...

360
00:22:10,822 --> 00:22:14,437
You realize I've been following your career
in the trade these past couple of years?

361
00:22:14,537 --> 00:22:19,507
A tufted sofa, a Flemish tapestry,
a brass-bound Regency-style table...

362
00:22:19,553 --> 00:22:21,740
I'd love to get reacquainted.

363
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,840
Catch up.

364
00:22:24,717 --> 00:22:26,688
Mantel clocks.

365
00:22:27,216 --> 00:22:30,016
Fringed, upholstered chairs, heavy drapes.

366
00:22:30,092 --> 00:22:32,946
Can we talk?
Over dinner, maybe?

367
00:22:34,712 --> 00:22:37,996
Stuart, thank you.
I-I...

368
00:22:38,126 --> 00:22:41,872
I... uh...
I'm at the beginning of a divorce.

369
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,825
It just didn't work out.

370
00:22:44,935 --> 00:22:48,266
- Oh, Miranda, I'm sorry.
- You don't have to say that.

371
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:52,496
No, really. I mean, I never
held any grudges or anything. I just...

372
00:22:53,112 --> 00:22:55,449
Well, I always hoped you'd find happiness.

373
00:22:56,886 --> 00:22:58,898
Oh, God, that's so nice.

374
00:22:58,938 --> 00:23:00,718
I mean, I was just worried
about coming in here

375
00:23:00,758 --> 00:23:02,822
I-I thought I might
scare you off the project.

376
00:23:02,909 --> 00:23:05,949
Oh, no, no.
Of course not. I...

377
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:08,925
I'm a professional.
I-I'm...

378
00:23:09,065 --> 00:23:13,953
I was flattered that you thought of me
after all these years and everything.

379
00:23:14,785 --> 00:23:16,595
Yeah, everything.

380
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:17,641
Well...

381
00:23:18,768 --> 00:23:20,468
Ancient history.

382
00:23:20,561 --> 00:23:21,675
Yeah.

383
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:29,665
I'm late.
I've got a meeting over at the bank.

384
00:23:29,812 --> 00:23:30,865
Oh.

385
00:23:34,355 --> 00:23:36,985
Can we talk?
Maybe later in the week?

386
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,048
- Sure.
- Good.

387
00:23:39,861 --> 00:23:41,808
It's good to see you again.

388
00:23:46,697 --> 00:23:48,184
Phew!!!

389
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:06,059
Mmm...
Good, huh?

390
00:24:09,402 --> 00:24:12,046
I know the place doesn't
look like much now, but...

391
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:15,483
It'll be OK. How do you like it?

392
00:24:16,963 --> 00:24:19,332
- Nice.
- It's OK.

393
00:24:19,563 --> 00:24:21,079
Detestable.

394
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:24,963
Hey, just give me some time.

395
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:27,929
I'm not too comfortable
with this new lifestyle.

396
00:24:28,118 --> 00:24:29,929
Neither are we.

397
00:24:30,825 --> 00:24:32,808
I know it's hard, sweetie.

398
00:24:34,453 --> 00:24:37,328
Can't you just tell Mommy
you're sorry?

399
00:24:39,348 --> 00:24:40,938
Wish I could.

400
00:24:41,944 --> 00:24:44,031
You know, grown-up problems...

401
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,858
They're a little more complicated, Nattie.

402
00:24:50,562 --> 00:24:52,465
How is the old battle-axe?

403
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,649
- Your mom.
- She's fine.

404
00:24:55,888 --> 00:24:58,377
Oh. I'm glad to hear that.

405
00:24:59,578 --> 00:25:03,958
I'd hate to think that she came down
with amoebic dysentery or piles.

406
00:25:04,325 --> 00:25:06,781
What's amoebic dysentery?

407
00:25:07,301 --> 00:25:09,828
Nat, it's some kind of
an infection in your tummy

408
00:25:09,911 --> 00:25:11,364
where you get diarrhoea for ever.

409
00:25:11,421 --> 00:25:13,491
- Diarrhoea for ever?
- It's not...

410
00:25:13,538 --> 00:25:15,078
And your body dries up and you die.

411
00:25:15,111 --> 00:25:16,227
You die?

412
00:25:16,374 --> 00:25:18,474
You don't have to be
so graphic with her.

413
00:25:18,541 --> 00:25:20,601
I read about it in a science book.

414
00:25:20,661 --> 00:25:23,414
Why would you want Mommy to die?

415
00:25:24,461 --> 00:25:27,751
Oh, honey, I don't want Mommy to die.

416
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,436
Then why did you say that?

417
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:36,260
Look, Dad, you're not trying very hard.

418
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,086
We only get to come here once a week.
That's not very much.

419
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,870
You're right. I'm sorry.
I'll try harder.

420
00:25:45,832 --> 00:25:47,059
Nattie,...

421
00:25:48,044 --> 00:25:49,954
I'll think good thoughts, OK?

422
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:51,597
About Mommy?

423
00:25:52,238 --> 00:25:54,698
I'll try.
I really will.

424
00:25:54,889 --> 00:25:58,789
- And call her a princess.
- Oh, yes.

425
00:25:59,956 --> 00:26:03,516
And right now I feel like a toad.

426
00:26:05,859 --> 00:26:07,433
Daddy's a toad.

427
00:26:14,307 --> 00:26:17,228
- Well, that's Mom.
- No. That can't be. She's an hour early.

428
00:26:17,638 --> 00:26:20,074
- Come on, Nattie, we gotta go.
- OK.

429
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,639
No, no, no! Come on.
Sit down, sit down.

430
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:24,348
Sit down!

431
00:26:24,494 --> 00:26:27,017
You don't have to run off
when she honks the horn.

432
00:26:27,804 --> 00:26:30,157
Come on, you're on my time now.

433
00:26:30,642 --> 00:26:32,729
You're my goddamn kids, too!

434
00:26:39,387 --> 00:26:41,177
Come on.
Hey.

435
00:26:50,237 --> 00:26:51,803
Hi.

436
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:55,108
Oh, Daniel...
Charming.

437
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:58,877
Thank you, Miranda.
I was going kind of for a refugee motif.

438
00:26:58,987 --> 00:27:01,498
You know, fleeing-my-homeland
kind of thing.

439
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:03,485
But look at you!

440
00:27:03,518 --> 00:27:08,388
This lovely Dances With Wolves motif.
What's your Indian name: Shops With A Fist?

441
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:12,127
- Are my children ready yet?
- No, our children are not ready yet...

442
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:16,463
...because you are an hour early
and you were late dropping them off.

443
00:27:16,503 --> 00:27:19,059
Daniel, I'm really sorry;
but, I don't have time for this, all right?

444
00:27:19,086 --> 00:27:20,706
I have to go to the bank
and the market.

445
00:27:20,733 --> 00:27:22,846
I have to drop something off
at the newspaper office.

446
00:27:22,873 --> 00:27:24,036
- I'm sorry.
- Newspaper? Oh.

447
00:27:24,063 --> 00:27:26,003
Are you taking out
one of those personal ads?

448
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:30,656
"DWF seeks WWM with BMW,
into light B&D"?

449
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:33,076
I'm placing an ad for a housekeeper.

450
00:27:34,316 --> 00:27:37,587
Housekeeper?
Why do you need a housekeeper?

451
00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:40,472
I need someone to be there
when the children get home from school,

452
00:27:40,546 --> 00:27:43,299
to clean, possibly start dinner...

453
00:27:43,512 --> 00:27:47,286
- How much are you gonna pay this person?
- $300 a week. Is that all right?

454
00:27:49,865 --> 00:27:52,048
May I see the ad?

455
00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:53,335
- Miranda?
- All right.

456
00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:55,342
Just let me look at the ad.
I have a right as their father. Please?

457
00:27:55,369 --> 00:27:57,229
All right. Here you go.
Anything else you wanna see?

458
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:59,729
- Are you offering?
- Not any more.

459
00:28:00,276 --> 00:28:01,565
What's the change?

460
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:04,522
- Are you guys all right?
- Yeah, Mommy. We're fine.

461
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:05,263
Oh!

462
00:28:06,082 --> 00:28:08,865
Hey, Miranda? Why don't you
let me take care of the kids?

463
00:28:08,955 --> 00:28:10,378
I'll pick 'em up after school,

464
00:28:10,418 --> 00:28:12,045
they can be with me for a couple hours,

465
00:28:12,072 --> 00:28:13,792
then drop them off
at your house after work.

466
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,333
- Yeah.
- Oh Mom, that'd be great!

467
00:28:15,379 --> 00:28:16,860
- Please!
- Look. The kids love it.

468
00:28:16,893 --> 00:28:18,146
Mommy, please.

469
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,106
I'll think about it.

470
00:28:25,124 --> 00:28:28,451
We're his goddamn kids, too.

471
00:28:32,814 --> 00:28:35,007
Kids say the darndest things.

472
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:36,974
Thank you.

473
00:28:37,361 --> 00:28:41,680
Any other choice phrases you'd like
to teach our five-year-old, Daniel?

474
00:28:41,747 --> 00:28:42,467
Uh!

475
00:28:42,751 --> 00:28:44,647
Come on, everybody get their coats.

476
00:28:44,768 --> 00:28:45,795
Come on.

477
00:28:45,853 --> 00:28:49,623
- Put them on and let's get out of here.
- OK, Mom.

478
00:28:49,683 --> 00:28:51,776
I would say go to the bathroom
before we go,

479
00:28:51,823 --> 00:28:53,704
but I don't think that's a good idea.

480
00:28:53,764 --> 00:28:54,991
Wait.

481
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,784
Hope you didn't eat much of that.

482
00:28:57,974 --> 00:29:00,207
Come on. Don't forget anything.
I don't wanna come back.

483
00:29:00,274 --> 00:29:01,468
- All right.
- OK.

484
00:29:01,514 --> 00:29:03,221
Come on, let's go.

485
00:29:03,736 --> 00:29:06,299
- See you Saturday.
- Say goodbye to your father.

486
00:29:06,766 --> 00:29:08,432
Bye, Daddy.

487
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,980
- Here's your ad.
- I'll get my purse.

488
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,986
Yeah, you'd better.

489
00:29:30,132 --> 00:29:31,217
Hello.

490
00:29:31,351 --> 00:29:33,744
Are you calling
in response to the ad?

491
00:29:34,527 --> 00:29:39,494
- Tell me, who was your previous employer?
<i>- I was in a band. Severe Tyre Damage.</i>

492
00:29:39,547 --> 00:29:42,070
- In a band?
- I just wanna know one thing.

493
00:29:42,097 --> 00:29:44,037
Are your kids well-behaved,

494
00:29:44,124 --> 00:29:47,414
or do they need, like, a few light slams
every now and then?

495
00:29:47,487 --> 00:29:48,520
Umm...

496
00:29:48,641 --> 00:29:51,067
- I'll have to get back to you.
<i>- Wow!</i>

497
00:29:54,182 --> 00:29:59,091
Ja, my name is llsa Himmelman. And I want
to know how many children do you have?

498
00:29:59,191 --> 00:30:02,721
- I have two girls and a boy.
<i>- Oh, a boy!</i>

499
00:30:02,817 --> 00:30:06,664
I don't work with the males
cos I used to be one.

500
00:30:09,417 --> 00:30:10,931
Yikes.

501
00:30:14,082 --> 00:30:15,736
- Hello.
- Aigh!

502
00:30:16,229 --> 00:30:21,040
Leyla, get back in your cell!
Don't make me get the hose!

503
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:22,456
Hello?

504
00:30:27,121 --> 00:30:30,130
I am job.

505
00:30:31,021 --> 00:30:35,150
- Do you speak English?
- I am job.

506
00:30:35,372 --> 00:30:37,898
I'm sorry. The position has been filled.

507
00:30:38,696 --> 00:30:40,899
Oh, what a nightmare!

508
00:30:42,346 --> 00:30:45,573
Let's go in for the kill.

509
00:30:53,962 --> 00:30:56,189
- Hello?
- Hello.

510
00:30:56,316 --> 00:30:59,899
I'm calling in regards
to the ad I read in the paper.

511
00:31:01,649 --> 00:31:05,549
Yes. Well, would you tell me
a little bit about yourself?

512
00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:07,909
Oh, certainly, dear.

513
00:31:07,979 --> 00:31:13,042
For the past 15 years I've worked for
the Smythe family of Elbourne, England.

514
00:31:13,102 --> 00:31:15,429
That's Smythe, not Smith, dear.

515
00:31:15,771 --> 00:31:18,764
<i>And for them, I did housecleaning, cooking,</i>

516
00:31:18,821 --> 00:31:22,101
<i>and took care of
their four glorious children.</i>

517
00:31:22,201 --> 00:31:24,911
<i>Boy, I grew quite attached
to them after 15 years,</i>

518
00:31:24,944 --> 00:31:27,884
<i>but they grew up,
as children tend to.</i>

519
00:31:27,977 --> 00:31:29,140
Oh, but listen to me.

520
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:32,600
I am going on when you should be
telling me about your little ones.

521
00:31:33,212 --> 00:31:36,508
- Well, I have two girls...
<i>- Oh, two precious gems.</i>

522
00:31:36,548 --> 00:31:38,468
<i>No doubt the jewel of your eye.</i>

523
00:31:38,747 --> 00:31:39,843
And one boy.

524
00:31:40,017 --> 00:31:43,223
Oh, the little prince.
How wonderful!

525
00:31:43,483 --> 00:31:46,723
I must tell you, there would be
a little light cooking is required.

526
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:49,592
Oh, I don't mind that, dear.
I'd love some heavy cooking.

527
00:31:49,632 --> 00:31:54,155
But I do have one rule: They'll only eat
good nutritious food with me.

528
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:55,915
And if there's any dispute about that,

529
00:31:55,962 --> 00:31:58,605
it's either good wholesome food
or empty tummies.

530
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,972
That's my rule.
I hope it's not too harsh for you, dear.

531
00:32:02,184 --> 00:32:03,780
No!
Umm...

532
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:08,200
Would you mind coming on an interview?
Say, Monday night at 7:30?

533
00:32:08,447 --> 00:32:11,248
<i>- Oh, I'd love to, dear.
- Wonderful.</i>

534
00:32:11,483 --> 00:32:16,277
I'm at 2640 Steiner Street.

535
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:18,892
Steiner.
Oh, how lovely!

536
00:32:19,196 --> 00:32:22,359
- Could you tell me your name?
- My name?

537
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,626
I thought I gave it to you, dear.

538
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:27,766
- No.
- Oh!

539
00:32:32,436 --> 00:32:35,066
- Doubtfire.
- I beg your pardon?

540
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:38,614
Doubtfire, dear.
Mrs Doubtfire.

541
00:32:38,676 --> 00:32:43,176
- Well, I look forward to meeting you.
- Oh, lovely, dear. Me, too.

542
00:32:43,245 --> 00:32:45,409
- Bye-bye.
- Ta-ta.

543
00:32:49,252 --> 00:32:50,742
Showtime.

544
00:32:56,453 --> 00:32:59,362
- Daniel, hi.
- Could you make me a woman?

545
00:33:00,649 --> 00:33:03,856
Honey, I'm so happy!

546
00:33:03,905 --> 00:33:06,721
- Oh, come here.
- I knew you'd understand.

547
00:33:08,874 --> 00:33:11,535
- Is this gonna hurt?
- Don't whine. Just relax.

548
00:33:11,675 --> 00:33:14,615
- Are you sure?
- Just remember, pain is beauty.

549
00:33:14,715 --> 00:33:16,478
OK, here we go.
Take a deep breath.

550
00:33:16,524 --> 00:33:18,711
- Instant eye lift.
- Wow!

551
00:33:20,155 --> 00:33:22,518
And you'd never see
the strings are under the wig.

552
00:33:22,705 --> 00:33:26,071
The man has five-o'clock shadow at 8.30am.
And you worry about the strings?

553
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:27,965
All right, we'll start with make-up.

554
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,747
- I'm not gonna wax.
- Don't worry. We'll just lightly spackle.

555
00:33:31,874 --> 00:33:35,347
- I feel like Gloria Swanson.
- You look like her mother.

556
00:33:35,534 --> 00:33:38,257
I'm ready for my close-up, Mr DeMille.

557
00:33:38,777 --> 00:33:40,450
OK, everyone.

558
00:33:40,924 --> 00:33:42,157
Let's pray.

559
00:33:45,626 --> 00:33:48,906
I hope you are using Jungle Red
because that is only the color I love.

560
00:33:48,952 --> 00:33:51,332
- Hmm. Matches your lips.
- God bless you. You know, umm...

561
00:33:51,392 --> 00:33:54,282
I'm feeling fabulous
because I met this beautiful Cuban.

562
00:33:54,362 --> 00:33:57,354
- Uh-huh.
- Every night is like the Bay of Pigs.

563
00:33:57,422 --> 00:34:00,048
I can't lie to you.
It's beautiful with him.

564
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,530
I don't know.

565
00:34:01,557 --> 00:34:03,390
This would scare the children.
You think so.

566
00:34:03,424 --> 00:34:05,637
I don't know.
Maybe this is too much for them.

567
00:34:05,723 --> 00:34:07,964
I think we have to go
to the next level.

568
00:34:08,097 --> 00:34:09,700
Latex.

569
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:13,620
Oy, it was such a shandeh.

570
00:34:13,673 --> 00:34:15,820
I should never buy
gribbenes from a mohel.

571
00:34:15,847 --> 00:34:17,220
It's so chewy.

572
00:34:17,343 --> 00:34:19,852
No, I know I feel like Bubbee.
This is not working.

573
00:34:19,893 --> 00:34:22,859
Daniel, this isn't a working.
But, don't worry, it's work in progress

574
00:34:22,893 --> 00:34:25,434
and you're my brother.
I will never let you be embarrassed.

575
00:34:25,461 --> 00:34:26,268
God bless you.

576
00:34:26,294 --> 00:34:28,101
I think we're gonna
have to do the entire face.

577
00:34:28,134 --> 00:34:30,841
But look at this nice thing though
we have here.

578
00:34:30,936 --> 00:34:33,662
♪ Matchmaker, matchmaker ♪
♪ Make me a match. ♪

579
00:34:33,722 --> 00:34:36,825
♪ Find me a find. ♪
♪ Catch me a catch. ♪

580
00:34:41,377 --> 00:34:43,804
♪ Don't tell me not to live, ♪
♪ Just sit and putter, ♪

581
00:34:43,844 --> 00:34:46,204
♪ Life's candy and the sun's ♪
♪ A ball of butter. ♪

582
00:34:46,558 --> 00:34:50,061
♪ Don't bring around the cloud ♪
♪ To rain on my parade. ♪

583
00:34:51,128 --> 00:34:53,131
It's not working.
I need to go older.

584
00:34:53,331 --> 00:34:56,851
Older? You mean, like Shelley Winters older
or Shirley MacLaine older?

585
00:34:56,904 --> 00:35:00,204
- What's the difference?
- Some Scotch tape and red hair dye.

586
00:35:00,452 --> 00:35:03,375
- What about Joan Collins?
- Oh, I don't think I have the strength.

587
00:35:03,428 --> 00:35:05,835
- All right.
- But I have some plaster.

588
00:36:09,649 --> 00:36:11,403
Are we close?

589
00:36:11,623 --> 00:36:14,956
Any closer and you'd be Mom.

590
00:36:17,674 --> 00:36:19,241
Yow!

591
00:36:31,049 --> 00:36:33,199
That's disgusting!

592
00:36:34,939 --> 00:36:38,042
That's the most revolting thing
that I've ever seen.

593
00:36:38,175 --> 00:36:39,702
Awesome.

594
00:36:42,047 --> 00:36:44,138
What is this?
Turn it off, will you?

595
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:47,618
Come on. Everybody over here.
I want you to meet this lady with me.

596
00:36:47,718 --> 00:36:51,554
I want you to be polite to her, then...
tell me what you think.

597
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:55,048
Everybody stand over here
and help me decide what to do.

598
00:37:00,527 --> 00:37:03,057
Hello.
Mrs Hillard, I presume.

599
00:37:03,167 --> 00:37:05,297
Yes. I'm Miranda Hillard.

600
00:37:05,397 --> 00:37:07,193
Euphegenia Doubtfire.

601
00:37:07,366 --> 00:37:10,137
Oh. Yes.
Won't you please come in?

602
00:37:10,227 --> 00:37:11,980
Thank you, dear.

603
00:37:13,278 --> 00:37:16,177
- And these must be the cherubs.
- Yes.

604
00:37:17,187 --> 00:37:20,381
- This is Natalie.
- Oh, hello, Natalie.

605
00:37:20,443 --> 00:37:22,346
- Are you wearing bug spray?
- Oh!

606
00:37:22,386 --> 00:37:24,206
- Nattie!
- Oh, it's quite all right, dear.

607
00:37:24,252 --> 00:37:27,195
No offense taken.
I was a little liberal with the atomizer.

608
00:37:27,229 --> 00:37:29,529
And at my age, dear, you know,
it's like a good Stilton.

609
00:37:29,562 --> 00:37:31,822
Everything does have its own aroma.

610
00:37:31,927 --> 00:37:36,390
I admire that honesty, Nattie.
That's a noble quality. Never lose that.

611
00:37:36,496 --> 00:37:40,043
It often disappears with age
or entering politics.

612
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:44,060
Look at that face.
You remind me of Stuart Little,

613
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:47,633
one of the most honorable creatures
in all of literature.

614
00:37:47,706 --> 00:37:51,352
- Do you know that book, Stuart Little?
- Yeah! It's one of my favorites.

615
00:37:51,398 --> 00:37:53,171
Oh!
Mine, too!

616
00:37:53,299 --> 00:37:56,015
Maybe I could read it to you -
if I get the position.

617
00:37:56,091 --> 00:37:57,754
- That would be wonderful.
- Agree.

618
00:37:57,808 --> 00:37:59,721
And who is this strapping young lad?

619
00:37:59,767 --> 00:38:01,961
- This is Chris.
- Hello, Christopher.

620
00:38:02,026 --> 00:38:03,294
Hello.

621
00:38:03,707 --> 00:38:07,725
Jeez, you're big for a lady.
You could play for the 49ers.

622
00:38:07,825 --> 00:38:11,734
Well, I was a fullback.
But that's European football, dear.

623
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:14,305
- Soccer?
- Yes. You play soccer, too?

624
00:38:14,435 --> 00:38:16,677
- Yeah!
- Oh, isn't that amazing?

625
00:38:16,775 --> 00:38:21,345
Yes, I was captain of the women's team.
We won three university championships.

626
00:38:21,445 --> 00:38:23,564
Oh, but that was decades ago!

627
00:38:23,615 --> 00:38:25,678
But I was more disciplined back then.

628
00:38:25,731 --> 00:38:28,104
I always put my studies
ahead of my athletics.

629
00:38:28,165 --> 00:38:29,491
I'm sure you're the same way.

630
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:31,938
I'm sure you got all
your homework done already.

631
00:38:31,984 --> 00:38:35,794
- No, not exactly.
- Really? Oh. That's a pity.

632
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,936
Because young men
who don't do their studies

633
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:40,990
often miss out
on more amusing activities.

634
00:38:42,294 --> 00:38:45,797
- And who is this young lady?
- This is Lydia.

635
00:38:46,837 --> 00:38:48,444
Hello, Lydia.

636
00:38:51,273 --> 00:38:53,863
This isn't fair, Mom.
Why do we need a housekeeper anyway?

637
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:55,949
Oh!
This is all I need.

638
00:38:56,016 --> 00:38:57,465
Look, why can't Dad do it?

639
00:38:57,492 --> 00:38:59,516
Excuse me, dear.
But, I don't think it's appropriate

640
00:38:59,556 --> 00:39:01,819
to argue with your mother
in front of a perfect stranger.

641
00:39:01,862 --> 00:39:03,272
If you don't mind me ssaying so.

642
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:06,784
I just don't see why
we can't spend the extra time with Dad.

643
00:39:06,884 --> 00:39:08,200
Maybe she's right, dear.

644
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,854
Maybe their father would be
a more appropriate person.

645
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:13,578
- No, I don't think so.
- Really?

646
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:15,642
It's not my fault, honey.

647
00:39:15,689 --> 00:39:18,295
If he would get a job and
a decent apartment...

648
00:39:18,433 --> 00:39:21,188
- You see, he's the kind...
- Excuse me, dear.

649
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:24,963
I'm sure you normally would encourage
the children to step out of the room

650
00:39:25,073 --> 00:39:28,002
before you verbally bash their father. Hm?

651
00:39:28,056 --> 00:39:30,802
If I did that,
I might never see them again.

652
00:39:33,026 --> 00:39:34,313
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

653
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,820
- You're right.
- No harm done.

654
00:39:35,893 --> 00:39:36,950
You're absolutely right.

655
00:39:36,997 --> 00:39:40,708
I'm not a therapist.
I just see what I see. They're yours.

656
00:39:40,802 --> 00:39:43,648
Why don't you guys go on upstairs?
I'll be up in a minute.

657
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:46,862
- It's lovely to meet you.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

658
00:39:47,028 --> 00:39:48,648
You too, Lydie.

659
00:39:55,235 --> 00:39:57,441
- Oh, they're a spirited bunch.
- Yes.

660
00:39:57,581 --> 00:39:59,777
Especially that Lydie.
She's got daggers for you.

661
00:39:59,837 --> 00:40:00,951
I know.

662
00:40:01,037 --> 00:40:04,224
- They're very upset with me right now.
- Probably the divorce.

663
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,273
How did you know?

664
00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:08,506
Well, you can sense it, dear,

665
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:10,455
- the way she talks about her father.
- Really?

666
00:40:10,481 --> 00:40:13,665
I don't think he's in the Navy, really,
the way she's saying she misses him.

667
00:40:13,712 --> 00:40:16,052
You know it. She wants him here.
It's like he's nearby.

668
00:40:16,191 --> 00:40:18,167
- Yes.
- Oh, that's so sad.

669
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,021
- Would you care to have a cup of tea?
- I'd love that.

670
00:40:21,121 --> 00:40:23,960
- It's right in here.
- What a lovely home you have.

671
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:26,360
- Did you decorate this yourself?
- Yes, I did.

672
00:40:26,459 --> 00:40:30,288
Oh, it reeks of taste!
Isn't this lovely, dear!

673
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:31,096
Thank you.

674
00:40:31,131 --> 00:40:33,842
- Here's my résumé.
- Oh. Thank you.

675
00:40:34,464 --> 00:40:37,700
- Let me start this tea.
- Oh, no, dear. Let me get that for you.

676
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,153
You've had a hard day.

677
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:44,000
 You just sit yourself down there
on that stool and leave the tea to me.

678
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:46,910
Thank you.
That's very nice of you.

679
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,070
Oh, not at all, dear.

680
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,243
- Oh. What a wonderful résumé.
- Oh, thank you, dear.

681
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,890
"Expert in first aid and CPR."

682
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,929
And Heimlich manoeuvre, dear.

683
00:40:57,043 --> 00:41:00,576
You can never be too prepared when
you got little ones are around, you know.

684
00:41:00,669 --> 00:41:04,445
Because they'll swallow anything.
You've got to be ready to pop it out.

685
00:41:05,419 --> 00:41:07,689
Oh, let's see.

686
00:41:07,842 --> 00:41:08,762
Oh!

687
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:11,659
What a perfectly appointed little cubby!

688
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:15,899
Look at this. Everything
has its place and name tag.

689
00:41:16,009 --> 00:41:18,949
How precise!
It's lovely.

690
00:41:19,049 --> 00:41:21,108
My husband never appreciated it.

691
00:41:21,165 --> 00:41:22,992
Oh. Poor dolt.

692
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:26,397
That's not the reason
you divorced him, was it?

693
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:28,077
No.

694
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:32,710
It's so sad, because marriage
can be such a blessing.

695
00:41:33,309 --> 00:41:35,078
So can divorce.

696
00:41:37,029 --> 00:41:40,529
Daniel is a very difficult man
to live with.

697
00:41:40,782 --> 00:41:41,756
Huh.

698
00:41:42,549 --> 00:41:44,302
But the children are crazy about him.

699
00:41:44,342 --> 00:41:47,858
You don't have to be
a psychic to sense that.

700
00:41:48,745 --> 00:41:51,898
My, you certainly do know
your way around a kitchen!

701
00:41:52,112 --> 00:41:53,119
Oh.

702
00:41:54,218 --> 00:41:57,033
It's just because everything
is so accessible.

703
00:41:57,207 --> 00:41:58,667
You designed it.

704
00:41:58,847 --> 00:42:02,133
I'm amazed that there isn't
a little label there that says "spoons".

705
00:42:05,427 --> 00:42:08,187
You remind me of someone.

706
00:42:08,929 --> 00:42:10,824
Really?
Who?

707
00:42:13,837 --> 00:42:16,067
I feel like I've known you for years.

708
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,772
Maybe we knew each other in another life.

709
00:42:22,307 --> 00:42:25,256
I would love for you
to come and work with us.

710
00:42:25,696 --> 00:42:28,366
- So would I.
- Great!

711
00:42:28,422 --> 00:42:30,163
Oh, it would be an honor.

712
00:42:31,316 --> 00:42:32,972
To us.

713
00:42:33,725 --> 00:42:37,499
To us.
The start of a business relationship.

714
00:43:07,715 --> 00:43:09,291
Good evening, dear.

715
00:43:11,411 --> 00:43:12,778
Evening, ma'am.

716
00:43:19,495 --> 00:43:21,222
Cold night, isn't it?

717
00:43:21,748 --> 00:43:23,195
Yes, it is.

718
00:43:24,328 --> 00:43:28,198
Hope you have something nice
and warm to go home to.

719
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,503
My back.

720
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,809
Jesus!

721
00:43:45,403 --> 00:43:49,723
If I find the misogynistic bastard
that invented heels, I'll kill him.

722
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,347
God...!

723
00:44:00,776 --> 00:44:02,190
Excuse me.

724
00:44:02,683 --> 00:44:04,370
Mrs Sellner!

725
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:07,337
Have we met?

726
00:44:08,094 --> 00:44:09,054
No.

727
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,680
But Danny's told me all about you.

728
00:44:12,144 --> 00:44:13,833
I'm his sister.

729
00:44:15,625 --> 00:44:18,422
His... much older sister.

730
00:44:19,348 --> 00:44:23,361
- You have his eyes.
- Only if he fills out a donor card.

731
00:44:24,903 --> 00:44:29,659
- Is Mr Hillard in? I have an appointment.
- Do you? Oh, that's wonderful.

732
00:44:29,759 --> 00:44:32,442
Let me go up and get him
and he'll be right down.

733
00:44:32,501 --> 00:44:34,062
- I'll come with you.
- No.

734
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,415
- Yes.
- Why?

735
00:44:35,509 --> 00:44:41,562
Because I have an appointment on Monday
and Friday evenings to check the apartment.

736
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:44,542
I remember him saying
something about that.

737
00:44:44,642 --> 00:44:48,205
Are you sure you want to walk in, dear?
It's three floors, hoofin' it all the way.

738
00:44:48,298 --> 00:44:50,682
- If you can do it, I can.
- I'll bet so!

739
00:44:50,738 --> 00:44:52,812
- Is your ticker all right?
- Topnotch.

740
00:44:52,952 --> 00:44:56,421
Oh, good!
Cos I don't want to jump-start you.

741
00:44:59,022 --> 00:45:00,415
Damn door.

742
00:45:00,577 --> 00:45:03,691
Come in, please, dear.
Sorry about that.

743
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,593
Here we are.
Daniel's abode.

744
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,953
Ah!

745
00:45:08,371 --> 00:45:12,054
Oh, that's mine, dear.
I'm a messy house guest.

746
00:45:12,141 --> 00:45:15,200
Well, just make yourself at home.
I'll be right back.

747
00:45:15,294 --> 00:45:17,370
He'll be back.
I'll go get him.

748
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:20,571
Don't be afraid.
I'll be right there. Danny!

749
00:45:20,681 --> 00:45:24,411
Danny boy, where are you?
Oh, here he is, dear. I found him.

750
00:45:24,459 --> 00:45:27,319
Danny, there's a
Mrs Sellner here to see you!

751
00:45:27,413 --> 00:45:29,955
- Oh, is she here?
- Yes, dear, she is.

752
00:45:30,009 --> 00:45:33,222
Oh Mrs Sellner,
I just got out of the shower!

753
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:35,873
I think you'll be very pleased with me!

754
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,260
I've been through
some really interesting changes!

755
00:45:39,329 --> 00:45:43,209
And I'm becoming a new man
and a model father!

756
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,269
He'll be right there.
He's just changing, dear.

757
00:45:48,309 --> 00:45:51,772
Yes, I want to keep you abreast
of the changes in my career!

758
00:45:51,835 --> 00:45:56,540
There have been two big developments!
I'm finally starting to come into my own!

759
00:45:56,650 --> 00:46:01,200
Things are really starting to take shape,
and I'm blossoming! Really, I am!

760
00:46:01,253 --> 00:46:06,529
Things were hairy for a while,
but oh, I'm in great shape now!

761
00:46:06,616 --> 00:46:09,259
I'm my own man now! Oh, yes!

762
00:46:10,529 --> 00:46:13,365
A job I could really sink my teeth into!

763
00:46:13,529 --> 00:46:15,525
I'll be right there, Mrs Sellner!

764
00:46:18,975 --> 00:46:22,809
So nice I don't have to save
face any more, Mrs Sellner!

765
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:25,982
Agh!

766
00:46:26,078 --> 00:46:29,681
Mrs Sellner! How are you?
Always a joy!

767
00:46:29,774 --> 00:46:32,778
If you wanted some cheese,
why didn't you just say so?

768
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:36,854
Well, I know you'll be happy to know
that I now am holding down two jobs.

769
00:46:36,907 --> 00:46:40,689
One for an educational film
and TV company - heavy responsibility.

770
00:46:40,829 --> 00:46:43,565
- And the other?
- Cleaning houses.

771
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,459
Not mine.

772
00:46:47,019 --> 00:46:49,452
- Big girl!
- Your sister is English?

773
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:51,388
Oh, she's half-English,
half-American.

774
00:46:51,474 --> 00:46:52,429
Half-sister, really.

775
00:46:52,455 --> 00:46:55,762
So, that makes her about eighth English.
I don't know.  I've never done the math.

776
00:46:55,838 --> 00:47:00,561
Let me see, my father was American.
He flew for the English during the war.

777
00:47:00,648 --> 00:47:04,266
He was in London and...
he met this lovely Englishwoman.

778
00:47:04,376 --> 00:47:07,472
Well, my sister was
the fruit of their passions.

779
00:47:07,526 --> 00:47:09,185
- Ah!
- Sorry.

780
00:47:09,385 --> 00:47:10,906
My sister's, not yours.

781
00:47:10,987 --> 00:47:13,316
You see, she's not
a very good housekeeper.

782
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:16,484
But she makes a fabulous cup
of English tea.

783
00:47:16,557 --> 00:47:17,807
- Really?
- Really.

784
00:47:17,887 --> 00:47:20,174
Well, I would adore
a good cup of English tea.

785
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:23,667
Oh! Wouldn't we all! I'll go get her.

786
00:47:23,767 --> 00:47:26,477
Sis! Oh, sis!

787
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:28,626
Sis, are you in here?

788
00:47:28,736 --> 00:47:31,543
Tea?
Cup of TNT.

789
00:47:49,155 --> 00:47:51,664
- Shit uh...
- Mom!

790
00:47:53,652 --> 00:47:54,919
Oh!

791
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,399
My face!

792
00:48:00,396 --> 00:48:01,996
Oh...
Oh!

793
00:48:03,975 --> 00:48:05,995
I've gotta go down and get it.

794
00:48:08,165 --> 00:48:09,025
Oh...

795
00:48:09,145 --> 00:48:10,735
Norman Bates!

796
00:48:32,617 --> 00:48:34,177
Miss Hillard?

797
00:48:34,834 --> 00:48:37,957
- Yes, dear?
- I take sugar in my tea.

798
00:48:38,034 --> 00:48:39,750
Oh, your tea!

799
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:42,764
Good!
I'll be right there with your tea!

800
00:48:46,144 --> 00:48:49,744
Coming right up, dear!
Sugar - one lump or two, dear?

801
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:53,144
- Two, please!
- Tea, sugar, hot water.

802
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:56,893
You got ow! it
Coming right your way, dear!

803
00:48:57,033 --> 00:48:59,286
I'll be right there with your tea!

804
00:49:02,023 --> 00:49:03,859
No!
Stop!

805
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,133
Stop!

806
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,213
Oh. Oh. No!

807
00:49:12,503 --> 00:49:13,972
Oh, shit!

808
00:49:15,842 --> 00:49:16,882
Oh.

809
00:49:17,156 --> 00:49:18,142
Ouch!

810
00:49:18,698 --> 00:49:19,885
Oh!

811
00:49:20,798 --> 00:49:22,545
Can I give you a hand?

812
00:49:22,698 --> 00:49:25,126
Oh, no, dear!
I don't need a hand.

813
00:49:25,179 --> 00:49:28,302
I need a face.
A face.

814
00:49:28,823 --> 00:49:32,948
- Are you sure?
- Oh, definitely!

815
00:49:38,122 --> 00:49:42,212
I'm not a Muslim.
I need a face! A face! Oh, God.

816
00:49:45,041 --> 00:49:46,651
Miss Hillard?

817
00:49:47,257 --> 00:49:48,791
The water's boiling.

818
00:49:49,042 --> 00:49:49,990
Hello!

819
00:49:50,378 --> 00:49:51,398
Ah!

820
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:56,901
Oh, I'm sorry to frighten you, dear.
I must look like a yeti in this get-up.

821
00:49:57,074 --> 00:50:00,734
This is my nightly meringue mask.
Part of my beauty regimen.

822
00:50:00,876 --> 00:50:02,885
What it is, it's basically egg whites,

823
00:50:03,092 --> 00:50:06,166
creme fraîche, powdered sugar,
vanilla and a touch of alum.

824
00:50:06,235 --> 00:50:07,288
There you go, dear.

825
00:50:07,355 --> 00:50:10,228
Oh, there you go! You've got
your cream and your sugar now.

826
00:50:10,275 --> 00:50:11,688
It's a little cappu-tea-no.

827
00:50:11,761 --> 00:50:13,891
One drop or two?
Would you like another?

828
00:50:13,961 --> 00:50:16,384
Oh! There you go!

829
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:18,963
Oh, as you can see,
I can't stay with you, dear.

830
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:21,203
I'm melting like
a snow cone in Phoenix.

831
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:23,856
There we go again!
I'll go get Danny, all right?

832
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:26,556
He'll be right with you.
Hold on.

833
00:50:26,716 --> 00:50:29,810
- Danny!
- Coming, sis!

834
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:33,470
- It was lovely to have met you!
- Lovely to meet you.

835
00:50:50,737 --> 00:50:52,390
Had a little accident.

836
00:50:52,557 --> 00:50:55,970
Would you be careful with this one?
She's an old woman.

837
00:50:58,303 --> 00:51:00,606
Why wasn't I an only child?

838
00:51:36,978 --> 00:51:39,308
- Oh! I'm sorry.
- That's quite all right.

839
00:51:47,931 --> 00:51:49,252
Here we go.

840
00:51:50,132 --> 00:51:52,377
Ready?
OK.

841
00:51:52,978 --> 00:51:54,588
- Did you have fun?
- Uh huh.

842
00:51:54,728 --> 00:51:57,671
- What did you do?
- I painted a picture of a bunny.

843
00:51:57,728 --> 00:51:59,431
And the teacher liked it.

844
00:51:59,511 --> 00:52:01,084
- He did?
- Uh huh.

845
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,347
<i>Here it is, Mel. A $1,000 worth of hair.
What am I supposed to do with it?</i>

846
00:52:05,406 --> 00:52:08,640
<i>- Well, Alan, I was wondering if...
- You want one of them?</i>

847
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:10,895
<i>I'd rather make a coat for my wife.</i>

848
00:52:10,941 --> 00:52:12,475
Oh, pick it up.
Pick it up. Pick it up.

849
00:52:12,515 --> 00:52:16,068
All right, everyone.
It's time to expand your minds.

850
00:52:16,147 --> 00:52:21,550
- It's homework time. OK?
- Yeah, but... after Dick Van Dyke.

851
00:52:22,887 --> 00:52:23,903
No.

852
00:52:24,803 --> 00:52:25,823
Now.

853
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,123
No.

854
00:52:28,435 --> 00:52:30,863
We always watch Dick Van Dyke.

855
00:52:33,796 --> 00:52:36,954
Really?
Well, not any more.

856
00:52:38,106 --> 00:52:41,699
The only thing you'll be watching
is Deep Sea-N-N.

857
00:52:42,806 --> 00:52:44,206
Now,

858
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:47,745
I know you're used to loosey-goosey.

859
00:52:47,845 --> 00:52:50,808
But I run a much tighter ship.

860
00:52:51,041 --> 00:52:55,648
Between the hours of 3pm and 7pm,
I'm in charge.

861
00:52:55,989 --> 00:52:59,779
And when I'm in charge,
you will follow a schedule.

862
00:53:00,086 --> 00:53:03,266
Those who do not follow the schedule
will be punished.

863
00:53:03,925 --> 00:53:06,608
- Punished?
- She's lying.

864
00:53:07,174 --> 00:53:09,001
She'd never punish us.

865
00:53:09,694 --> 00:53:11,934
Don't... fuss with me.

866
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,704
This is exploitation.
It's not fair.

867
00:53:46,773 --> 00:53:49,994
- Shut up, Lydie.
- Yeah. You got us into this.

868
00:53:50,147 --> 00:53:52,580
Ooh, my little ankle-biters.

869
00:53:52,643 --> 00:53:55,203
Do I sense dissension in the ranks?

870
00:53:55,313 --> 00:53:58,820
Are we ready for homework,
or shall we continue manual labor?

871
00:53:59,113 --> 00:54:00,836
No. Anything but this.

872
00:54:00,996 --> 00:54:04,389
Right. Then upstairs,
my little nose-miners.

873
00:54:04,496 --> 00:54:07,143
Go.
Flee before me!

874
00:54:07,293 --> 00:54:09,409
Onward and upward!

875
00:54:09,693 --> 00:54:11,863
Go pump some neurons.

876
00:54:12,002 --> 00:54:14,053
Expand your craniums.

877
00:54:14,163 --> 00:54:16,329
- I miss Dad.
- Me, too.

878
00:54:16,476 --> 00:54:18,296
Me most.

879
00:54:20,474 --> 00:54:22,316
I'm here, guys.

880
00:54:23,738 --> 00:54:25,514
In some form.

881
00:54:28,743 --> 00:54:30,272
Let's see.

882
00:54:34,213 --> 00:54:36,473
OK.
Pinch of basil.

883
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:38,918
Oh!

884
00:54:39,187 --> 00:54:40,384
Damn!

885
00:54:46,856 --> 00:54:48,776
Oh, ah!

886
00:54:49,018 --> 00:54:50,614
Mayday!

887
00:54:51,832 --> 00:54:53,921
Oh, God!
It's gonna blow!

888
00:54:54,601 --> 00:54:55,674
Oh, wait.

889
00:54:56,104 --> 00:54:58,164
Easy. Easy.
Oh.

890
00:54:58,401 --> 00:55:00,174
Damn.
Calm down.

891
00:55:00,241 --> 00:55:01,561
Oh. Oh. Oh.

892
00:55:01,641 --> 00:55:04,244
Come on.
Hey, hey, hey. Sh!!

893
00:55:04,324 --> 00:55:06,404
How is it?
Oh, my God! It's clotted.

894
00:55:06,524 --> 00:55:07,797
Oh, God.

895
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:11,660
This hollandaise smells like burnt rubber.

896
00:55:12,778 --> 00:55:14,626
God, it's hot in here.

897
00:55:15,381 --> 00:55:16,448
Ah!

898
00:55:16,775 --> 00:55:18,861
Oh! Oh! Oh!

899
00:55:18,928 --> 00:55:20,081
Ow! Ow!

900
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:35,263
Look at this!

901
00:55:35,337 --> 00:55:38,123
My first day as a woman
and I'm getting hot flashes.

902
00:55:55,429 --> 00:55:57,790
- Hey, here's your food, lady.
- How much do I owe you?

903
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:01,159
- 135.27.
- 135 dollars?!

904
00:56:01,216 --> 00:56:03,319
- That's certainly...
- And 27 cents.

905
00:56:03,429 --> 00:56:06,269
Four dinners.
20 bucks extra for rushing us.

906
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:10,338
Rushing? Well, you could have been
a little bit faster, dear.

907
00:56:10,391 --> 00:56:13,888
- There's 140. Do you have change?
- No.

908
00:56:14,009 --> 00:56:17,069
I thought you wouldn't.
Thank you very much.

909
00:56:47,424 --> 00:56:49,236
Hello!

910
00:56:51,047 --> 00:56:53,583
Hello!
Anybody home?

911
00:56:55,647 --> 00:56:58,618
- Where were you guys?
- Upstairs, doing our homework.

912
00:56:58,718 --> 00:57:00,918
Mrs Doubtfire said we had to.

913
00:57:01,088 --> 00:57:03,681
Oh, she did, huh?

914
00:57:03,758 --> 00:57:06,727
Doing your homework.
How great!

915
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:08,626
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.

916
00:57:08,726 --> 00:57:13,072
Look at this place! It looks wonderful!
All spick-and-span.

917
00:57:21,149 --> 00:57:22,616
Wow!

918
00:57:26,349 --> 00:57:28,789
Dinner is served, madam.

919
00:57:29,656 --> 00:57:31,281
How lovely!

920
00:57:53,711 --> 00:57:55,387
Mrs Doubtfire?

921
00:57:55,731 --> 00:57:59,462
Lydia, dear. Get back inside
right now before you freeze.

922
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:04,115
Look... I just want to apologize
for being such a pain today.

923
00:58:04,215 --> 00:58:08,346
- Oh, dear, it's all right.
- No, I'm really sorry.

924
00:58:09,225 --> 00:58:11,588
It's just...
I'm still kind of messed-up.

925
00:58:11,742 --> 00:58:13,609
About everything.

926
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,861
We all are, sweetie.

927
00:58:18,621 --> 00:58:19,691
What?

928
00:58:20,965 --> 00:58:25,124
I just mean I understand
the pain you're all going through.

929
00:58:27,273 --> 00:58:28,522
Yeah.

930
00:58:30,076 --> 00:58:32,522
Well, I also wanted to thank you.

931
00:58:33,044 --> 00:58:36,174
- For what?
- For making my mom so happy.

932
00:58:36,924 --> 00:58:37,884
Oh.

933
00:58:38,784 --> 00:58:41,980
She hasn't been in
this good a mood since...

934
00:58:42,414 --> 00:58:44,147
I can't even remember.

935
00:58:46,024 --> 00:58:47,700
It's been a long time.

936
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:50,624
- It has?
- Yeah.

937
00:58:51,934 --> 00:58:53,953
Well, I...I gotta go back in, but...

938
00:58:54,133 --> 00:58:57,593
- Go.
- OK. Thank you.

939
00:58:58,233 --> 00:59:00,183
You're welcome.

940
00:59:03,743 --> 00:59:05,763
- Bye.
- Bye.

941
00:59:11,653 --> 00:59:13,149
Thank you.

942
00:59:26,692 --> 00:59:28,143
Oh, no.

943
00:59:29,762 --> 00:59:33,665
Well, milady!
It's a pleasure to see you again!

944
00:59:33,973 --> 00:59:35,852
A joy, as always.

945
00:59:50,797 --> 00:59:52,204
Uh!

946
00:59:54,522 --> 00:59:57,357
I like that Mediterranean look in women.

947
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:00,713
Natural. Healthy.

948
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:04,291
Just the way God made you.

949
01:00:05,431 --> 01:00:08,287
But, he broke the mould
when he made me, dear.

950
01:00:08,488 --> 01:00:10,375
He made me very special.

951
01:00:10,471 --> 01:00:12,141
He sure did.

952
01:00:14,141 --> 01:00:15,250
Bless you.

953
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:24,843
Oh!

954
01:00:39,965 --> 01:00:41,665
Oh! Good!

955
01:01:34,018 --> 01:01:37,458
I am not a crook.
I am not a crook.

956
01:01:37,558 --> 01:01:40,314
"She kissed Stuart and thanked him. "

957
01:01:40,758 --> 01:01:43,128
"'How was it down there? '
asked Mr Little,

958
01:01:43,228 --> 01:01:46,758
who was always curious to know
about places he'd never been to. "

959
01:01:46,898 --> 01:01:48,567
"'It was all right," said Stuart.

960
01:02:36,632 --> 01:02:37,599
Oh!

961
01:02:38,416 --> 01:02:40,176
Back off, asshole!

962
01:02:40,485 --> 01:02:41,678
Beat it!

963
01:02:44,586 --> 01:02:46,697
Broke my bag, the bastard.

964
01:02:46,884 --> 01:02:47,864
Oh.

965
01:02:55,375 --> 01:02:57,004
Lover boy's here.

966
01:02:57,518 --> 01:03:01,415
What a beautiful little car for Don Juan!

967
01:03:05,566 --> 01:03:07,778
So sad when that happens!

968
01:03:08,218 --> 01:03:10,051
It was our junior year in college, OK?

969
01:03:10,118 --> 01:03:13,245
And your mother got asked
to design this big float.

970
01:03:15,786 --> 01:03:18,800
- I wasn't that young.
- I went to kiss her...

971
01:03:19,235 --> 01:03:23,005
Elastic bands were flying out everywhere.
Hit you in the face.

972
01:03:23,105 --> 01:03:25,908
- That's not true!
- It was like Jaws.

973
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:30,601
- Isn't that the pretty picture!
- Oh. Mrs Doubtfire.

974
01:03:30,884 --> 01:03:34,690
Miranda. What a pleasant surprise
to see you home so early, dear.

975
01:03:34,816 --> 01:03:37,899
- And who is your gentleman caller?
- This is Stu.

976
01:03:38,012 --> 01:03:41,519
- He just wanted to come and meet the kids.
- Oh, did he?

977
01:03:41,594 --> 01:03:44,993
Ah, this must be the famous Mrs Doubtfire.

978
01:03:45,175 --> 01:03:47,683
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Oh.

979
01:03:48,394 --> 01:03:51,234
Yes, well...
Miranda's been raving about you.

980
01:03:51,364 --> 01:03:54,234
- Odd. She's never mentioned you.
- No?

981
01:03:54,374 --> 01:03:57,463
- No.
- Well... It's good to meet you.

982
01:03:57,603 --> 01:03:59,633
- You, too.
- Yes.

983
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:04,689
I have a home in London. I was born there.
What part of England are you from?

984
01:04:04,801 --> 01:04:08,786
- Here and there, dear. All over, really.
- Yes?

985
01:04:09,531 --> 01:04:13,573
- Accent's a little kind of... muddled.
- Really? So is your tan.

986
01:04:16,136 --> 01:04:16,989
Oh, no, dear.

987
01:04:17,043 --> 01:04:20,316
You know, can you help me with something?
I found this outside.

988
01:04:20,869 --> 01:04:22,962
Yes. This is off my Mercedes.

989
01:04:23,062 --> 01:04:27,592
Off your Mercedes, dear?
You own that big, expensive car out there?

990
01:04:27,702 --> 01:04:30,971
Oh, dear. What they say a man
who has to buy a big car like that

991
01:04:31,011 --> 01:04:33,473
tries to compensate for smaller genitals.

992
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:37,490
But not in your case, cos I see
that you're a strapping lad, aren't you?

993
01:04:38,112 --> 01:04:40,811
- It was lovely to meet you.
- You too, dear.

994
01:04:41,444 --> 01:04:43,927
Mrs Doubtfire, may I speak
with you for moments?

995
01:04:43,967 --> 01:04:45,760
Ooh, certainly, dear.

996
01:04:46,081 --> 01:04:48,992
Could you stay
a few extra hours this evening?

997
01:04:49,092 --> 01:04:53,252
Stu. That's more of a thick soup
than a name, really.

998
01:04:53,362 --> 01:04:55,481
It's a name. It's short for Stuart.

999
01:04:55,532 --> 01:04:58,361
- Is it?
- Yes. He's a client. And a friend.

1000
01:04:58,732 --> 01:05:01,320
- He was... he is a friend.
- What is he?

1001
01:05:01,470 --> 01:05:04,286
- I don't know what's happening.
- Oh, what is it, dear? Just take...

1002
01:05:04,366 --> 01:05:07,106
- Isn't he fabulous?
- Oh, kind of, dear.

1003
01:05:07,173 --> 01:05:09,701
If you like that handsome, rugged type.

1004
01:05:09,881 --> 01:05:13,311
But personally, I prefer short,
furry and funny.

1005
01:05:14,071 --> 01:05:15,977
He just wants to go out and have a drink.

1006
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,934
And I think that's pretty harmless.
Don't you?

1007
01:05:17,988 --> 01:05:19,560
Oh, absolutely not, dear.

1008
01:05:19,634 --> 01:05:21,570
'Cause they always have other intentions.

1009
01:05:21,610 --> 01:05:23,651
Well, this is business, mostly.

1010
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:27,264
I'll just sit there and sip club soda
and we'll go over wallpaper samples.

1011
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:30,620
Dear Miranda. Wake up
and smell the coffee, dear.

1012
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:33,320
Can't you see the lust in that man's eyes?

1013
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:36,331
It's too soon, dear.
Really.

1014
01:05:36,471 --> 01:05:38,700
You've got to give
your divorce time, dear.

1015
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:43,574
Let your sheets cool down before you bring
someone else into the bed, all right?

1016
01:05:43,812 --> 01:05:46,290
Mrs Doubtfire, may I ask you a question?

1017
01:05:46,328 --> 01:05:48,096
Oh, certainly, dear.

1018
01:05:48,437 --> 01:05:51,303
How long after
Mr Doubtfire passed away...

1019
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:52,709
- Winston.
- Winston.

1020
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:55,836
...did you feel any desire...

1021
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:01,119
- Never.
- Never.

1022
01:06:01,229 --> 01:06:03,129
- Never again.
- Never again?

1023
01:06:03,229 --> 01:06:07,099
Once the father of your children
is out of the picture,

1024
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:10,915
the only solution is
total and lifelong celibacy.

1025
01:06:11,265 --> 01:06:12,825
- Celibacy?
- Yes.

1026
01:06:13,088 --> 01:06:15,938
And if you violate that,
heaven forgive you.

1027
01:06:17,194 --> 01:06:18,327
Good luck.

1028
01:06:19,795 --> 01:06:21,401
Thank you.

1029
01:06:27,648 --> 01:06:29,988
"Preponderance."

1030
01:06:30,333 --> 01:06:32,049

Oh, that's very good.

1039
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:53,827
Will you excuse me, dear?
Call of nature.

1040
01:06:53,883 --> 01:06:54,750
All right.

1041
01:06:54,947 --> 01:06:57,377
Check those.
I'll be right back.

1042
01:07:00,911 --> 01:07:02,644
Oh.
Sh...

1043
01:07:19,766 --> 01:07:21,967
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God!

1044
01:07:22,667 --> 01:07:25,167
- Oh, my God!
- Chris! Wait!

1045
01:07:26,007 --> 01:07:28,037
Lydia! Lydia, come on.
We gotta call the cops!

1046
01:07:28,177 --> 01:07:30,666
- We gotta dial 911 now!
- Why?

1047
01:07:30,816 --> 01:07:34,595
Well, Mrs Doubtfire.
He's a she! He's a she! He's a she, see.

1048
01:07:34,714 --> 01:07:36,441
- What?!
- Ah! Ah.

1049
01:07:36,579 --> 01:07:39,154
- He's half man, half woman!
- What?!

1050
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:40,317
Yes, I awear.

1051
01:07:40,404 --> 01:07:42,204
All right, everyone.
No, just calm down.

1052
01:07:42,241 --> 01:07:43,491
- Freeze!
- Just relax, please.

1053
01:07:43,517 --> 01:07:44,891
- Or you're gonna get it!
- In the balls!

1054
01:07:44,924 --> 01:07:45,690
Yeah!

1055
01:07:46,096 --> 01:07:48,586
- She's got 'em?
- She's got everything.

1056
01:07:48,696 --> 01:07:50,417
All right. Listen to me.

1057
01:07:50,896 --> 01:07:53,365
I'm not... who you think I am.

1058
01:07:53,465 --> 01:07:56,788
- Ah, no shit!
- Watch your mouth, young man!

1059
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:01,921
Oh, my God.

1060
01:08:05,898 --> 01:08:07,138
Dad?

1061
01:08:07,492 --> 01:08:08,752
Yeah.

1062
01:08:09,515 --> 01:08:12,115
- Dad?
- Yeah, honey.

1063
01:08:13,724 --> 01:08:16,522
You don't really like
wearin' that stuff, do you, dad?

1064
01:08:17,024 --> 01:08:19,987
Well, some of it's comfortable.
No! No.

1065
01:08:20,207 --> 01:08:21,793
It's a pain in the padded ass.

1066
01:08:22,161 --> 01:08:24,761
This is not a way of life.
It's just a job.

1067
01:08:24,865 --> 01:08:28,261
I don't go to old-lady bars or
anything like that after work. You know.

1068
01:08:28,314 --> 01:08:31,334
You know, it's...it's the only way
I could see you guys every day.

1069
01:08:31,474 --> 01:08:35,273
- Who did this?
- Uncle Frank and Aunt Jack.

1070
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:43,614
It's really you in there.

1071
01:08:44,008 --> 01:08:45,588
Yeah.

1072
01:08:48,323 --> 01:08:49,912
It's just a mask.

1073
01:08:50,066 --> 01:08:53,272
And this is a body suit.
I didn't have any operations or anything.

1074
01:08:53,694 --> 01:08:55,612
- It's good.
- Yeah.

1075
01:08:56,033 --> 01:08:57,412
- Hi.
- Hi.

1076
01:08:57,512 --> 01:08:58,992
Oh.
Hey.

1077
01:08:59,393 --> 01:09:00,649
Sorry I scared you.

1078
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:03,230
- Come here, Chris.
- No. No, it's OK.

1079
01:09:03,373 --> 01:09:04,649
I get it.

1080
01:09:04,803 --> 01:09:07,309
I just, you know,
don't hug you or anything.

1081
01:09:07,503 --> 01:09:08,879
Not just yet.

1082
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:11,666
That's cool.
It's a guy thing.

1083
01:09:11,826 --> 01:09:12,926
Yeah.

1084
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:17,212
Well, now that you know,
you can't tell Mom, OK?

1085
01:09:17,483 --> 01:09:23,183
Cos if she finds out, I'll only be able
to see you through plate glass. OK?

1086
01:09:23,413 --> 01:09:26,382
And we can't tell Nattie,
cos she'll blow my cover.

1087
01:09:26,522 --> 01:09:29,682
So you have to promise me,
it's just us. All right?

1088
01:09:29,792 --> 01:09:32,162
- You promise?
- Yeah.

1089
01:09:34,632 --> 01:09:36,208
It's OK.

1090
01:09:38,603 --> 01:09:41,302
All right?
It's our little secret.

1091
01:09:44,841 --> 01:09:49,141
Most of the dinosaurs were herbivorous.

1092
01:09:49,511 --> 01:09:52,112
But this Tyrannosaurus rex

1093
01:09:52,961 --> 01:09:55,248
is a carnivore.

1094
01:10:02,061 --> 01:10:05,577
The reptile-like Saurischia

1095
01:10:06,184 --> 01:10:07,611
Saurischia

1096
01:10:08,377 --> 01:10:10,953
and the bird-like

1097
01:10:11,873 --> 01:10:13,374
Ornithischia.

1098
01:10:19,881 --> 01:10:22,640
<i>Now, we're going to go</i>

1099
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:25,250
<i>where no human being has ever been.</i>

1100
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:26,183
Oh, no.

1101
01:10:26,283 --> 01:10:28,663
<i>As we continue our deam with free history.</i>

1102
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:31,110
Which one's the dinosaur?

1103
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:35,010
- The one in the middle, I think.
- Nah, you're wrong. They're all extinct.

1104
01:10:37,791 --> 01:10:41,407
I can't believe they're still
subjecting kids to this. This is insane.

1105
01:10:41,998 --> 01:10:43,838
They should have
a little disclaimer that says:

1106
01:10:43,864 --> 01:10:46,564
Do not operate heavy machinery
while watching this show.

1107
01:10:47,469 --> 01:10:48,879
It's incredible.

1108
01:10:50,005 --> 01:10:52,772
This guy used to put me to sleep
when I was a kid.

1109
01:10:52,842 --> 01:10:53,768
It's amazing.

1110
01:10:53,845 --> 01:10:57,125
He has the warmth of a snow pea.
It makes Mr Rogers look like Mick Jagger.

1111
01:10:57,178 --> 01:10:58,644
That's insane.

1112
01:10:59,752 --> 01:11:03,305
What kind of idiot kept
this guy on the air for 25 years?

1113
01:11:03,825 --> 01:11:05,112
Me.

1114
01:11:08,465 --> 01:11:09,792
You?

1115
01:11:10,442 --> 01:11:12,302
Jonathan Lundy.

1116
01:11:13,706 --> 01:11:16,519
Jonathan Lundy, General Manager, owner?

1117
01:11:17,399 --> 01:11:19,802
Daniel Hillard, former employee.

1118
01:11:20,051 --> 01:11:22,242
- Ah, maybe.
- Huh?

1119
01:11:23,348 --> 01:11:24,875
That's funny.

1120
01:11:25,433 --> 01:11:29,087
Listen, I-I don't mean to criticize.
I just, you know, sometimes I have...

1121
01:11:29,154 --> 01:11:31,420
Criticize all you want.
The show's terrible.

1122
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:33,056
- Oh, Mr Lundry...
- No, I'm gonna cancel it.

1123
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:34,863
It's pulling down the whole
afternoon schedule.

1124
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:36,210
- Come on.
- Nah, he's gone.

1125
01:11:36,278 --> 01:11:37,568
- You know what you gotta do?
- What?

1126
01:11:37,601 --> 01:11:39,195
Maybe, just um...
you know, start from scratch.

1127
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:41,548
Give it kind of uh...
maybe a musical number.

1128
01:11:41,618 --> 01:11:44,718
You know, imagine a little...a little
Tyrannosaurus rex comes out you know...

1129
01:11:44,765 --> 01:11:45,724
- Hillard?
- Yes.

1130
01:11:45,765 --> 01:11:47,164
Get your ass to the truck.

1131
01:11:47,218 --> 01:11:49,974
That shipment's gotta make
a six o'clock flight to LA.

1132
01:11:50,167 --> 01:11:52,687
Tone, this is Mr Lundy.

1133
01:11:53,367 --> 01:11:55,688
- He knows who I am.
- Yeah.

1134
01:11:55,838 --> 01:12:00,137
Did you ever wish that sometimes you could
freeze-frame a single moment in your day,

1135
01:12:00,254 --> 01:12:03,281
look at it and say "This is not my life"?

1136
01:12:30,167 --> 01:12:33,283
Miranda.
What are you home early for, dear?

1137
01:12:33,362 --> 01:12:35,436
I had an appointment.
Oh, thank you!

1138
01:12:35,505 --> 01:12:37,876
With the court liaison. Mrs Sellner.

1139
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:38,849
Oh.

1140
01:12:38,982 --> 01:12:41,453
- I can't believe it.
- What, dear?

1141
01:12:42,258 --> 01:12:45,111
She says that Daniel has
some woman living with him,

1142
01:12:45,185 --> 01:12:47,085
- pretending to be his sister!
- Oh!

1143
01:12:47,486 --> 01:12:49,736
I told her he doesn't even have a sister.

1144
01:12:49,869 --> 01:12:53,442
Oh, Mrs Sellner's probably mistaken.

1145
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:56,945
Oh, she's a social worker, dear.
Really!

1146
01:12:57,095 --> 01:13:00,725
And besides,
how could he replace you?

1147
01:13:00,795 --> 01:13:03,325
And so quickly.
Really!

1148
01:13:03,505 --> 01:13:07,131
She's supposed to be older
and very unattractive.

1149
01:13:09,107 --> 01:13:11,128
Really?
Oh.

1150
01:13:11,446 --> 01:13:12,938
Mrs Doubtfire.

1151
01:13:15,077 --> 01:13:18,137
- Yes?
- Did you and Mr Doubtfire ever...

1152
01:13:19,184 --> 01:13:21,340
You must have had
your share of problems.

1153
01:13:21,387 --> 01:13:24,927
Oh, of course, dear.
What marriage doesn't?

1154
01:13:25,155 --> 01:13:28,815
But I always say:
The bad times fade away,

1155
01:13:28,955 --> 01:13:32,051
and the good ones adhere
themselves to your memory.

1156
01:13:32,124 --> 01:13:34,907
- Yes. Excuse me.
- That's all right.

1157
01:13:36,274 --> 01:13:37,401
Oh.

1158
01:13:37,803 --> 01:13:41,057
As I hold this cold meat,
I'm reminded of Winston.

1159
01:13:41,124 --> 01:13:42,771
God rest his soul.

1160
01:13:43,204 --> 01:13:45,722
When did he... pass on?

1161
01:13:46,814 --> 01:13:48,284
Eight years ago, dear.

1162
01:13:48,751 --> 01:13:50,191
This November.

1163
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:51,897
What happened?

1164
01:13:52,543 --> 01:13:55,244
- He was quite fond of the drink.
- Ah.

1165
01:13:56,290 --> 01:13:57,757
It was the drink that killed him.

1166
01:13:57,844 --> 01:13:59,857
How awful!
He was an alcoholic?

1167
01:13:59,904 --> 01:14:02,377
No.
He was hit by a Guinness truck.

1168
01:14:03,282 --> 01:14:05,862
So it was quite literally
the drink that killed him.

1169
01:14:06,309 --> 01:14:08,808
- How tragic!
- Yes.

1170
01:14:11,314 --> 01:14:12,481
Oh.

1171
01:14:13,263 --> 01:14:16,813
But he was a good man, though, really.

1172
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:19,492
A sainted man.

1173
01:14:20,195 --> 01:14:22,662
And despite his mountains of faults,

1174
01:14:22,688 --> 01:14:26,848
Still I always say: A flawed husband
is better than none at all.

1175
01:14:27,515 --> 01:14:29,471
Who needs a husband
when I've got you?

1176
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:32,058
Oh, surely you don't mean that, dear?

1177
01:14:32,122 --> 01:14:34,552
- Well...
- Oh, that's so sweet!

1178
01:14:34,652 --> 01:14:38,422
You can't imagine what it was like
being married to Daniel.

1179
01:14:38,522 --> 01:14:43,055
Tell me, dear. What was so horrible
about this man you lived with for 14 years?

1180
01:14:43,432 --> 01:14:45,492
Well, at first, nothing.

1181
01:14:45,632 --> 01:14:49,108
He was...
He was so... romantic.

1182
01:14:49,175 --> 01:14:50,948
- So passionate.
- Really?

1183
01:14:51,001 --> 01:14:53,871
He sounds like an absolute stud, dear.

1184
01:14:53,937 --> 01:14:57,397
Oh, I hope you don't mind me
being a tad rude, but...

1185
01:14:57,942 --> 01:15:02,225
How was he... you know...
on a scale of 1 to 10?

1186
01:15:02,292 --> 01:15:05,445
Oh, well. That part was always...

1187
01:15:06,161 --> 01:15:07,495
OK.

1188
01:15:07,843 --> 01:15:10,421
Just OK?
Oh.

1189
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:14,443
He was probably a Casanova
compared to poor old Winston.

1190
01:15:14,761 --> 01:15:17,251
- What was the matter with Winston?
- Oh, dear.

1191
01:15:17,361 --> 01:15:21,351
Winston's idea of foreplay was
"Effie, brace yourself. "

1192
01:15:24,839 --> 01:15:28,182
It was Daniel's spontaneity and energy
I fell in love with.

1193
01:15:28,275 --> 01:15:29,769
Really?

1194
01:15:30,209 --> 01:15:34,345
Everyone else I knew
was so organized, so scheduled.

1195
01:15:34,753 --> 01:15:36,265
Like me, I guess.

1196
01:15:37,153 --> 01:15:42,033
But Daniel was so wonderfully different.
And funny. He could always make me laugh.

1197
01:15:42,293 --> 01:15:45,250
I always say: The key
to a solid marriage is laughter.

1198
01:15:46,889 --> 01:15:50,199
But after a few years,
everything just stopped being funny.

1199
01:15:50,313 --> 01:15:51,532
Why?

1200
01:15:52,285 --> 01:15:54,245
I was working all the time and...

1201
01:15:54,499 --> 01:15:56,429
he was always between jobs.

1202
01:15:56,702 --> 01:15:58,768
I hardly ever got
to see the kids and...

1203
01:15:58,802 --> 01:16:02,669
On the night I would try to get home early
to be with them, something would go wrong.

1204
01:16:02,722 --> 01:16:05,724
The house would be wrecked
and I'd have to clean it up.

1205
01:16:07,343 --> 01:16:12,239
He never knew, but so many nights I just...
cried myself to sleep.

1206
01:16:13,762 --> 01:16:15,146
Really?

1207
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:19,034
The truth is,...

1208
01:16:19,367 --> 01:16:21,920
I didn't like who I was
when I was with him.

1209
01:16:22,154 --> 01:16:24,400
I would turn into this horrible person.

1210
01:16:25,571 --> 01:16:28,901
I didn't want my kids growing up
with a mother like that.

1211
01:16:30,471 --> 01:16:32,931
When I'm not with Daniel,
I'm better.

1212
01:16:34,148 --> 01:16:35,308
And...

1213
01:16:35,974 --> 01:16:38,354
I'm sure he's better
when he's not with me.

1214
01:16:40,077 --> 01:16:41,524
Well, you never...

1215
01:16:42,678 --> 01:16:43,974
I mean...

1216
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:47,041
Did you ever say
anything to him, dear?

1217
01:16:49,477 --> 01:16:52,307
Daniel never liked
to talk about anything serious.

1218
01:16:56,885 --> 01:16:57,885
Uh...

1219
01:16:58,184 --> 01:17:01,021
I used to think Daniel could do anything.

1220
01:17:01,234 --> 01:17:02,801
Except be serious.

1221
01:17:04,970 --> 01:17:08,133
But then, I was serious enough
for everybody.

1222
01:17:29,950 --> 01:17:31,171
- Oh!
- Oh!

1223
01:17:31,244 --> 01:17:32,964
- Oh, man.
- This is great!

1224
01:17:33,044 --> 01:17:35,377
- Isn't this posh!
- This is wonderful and amazing.

1225
01:17:35,427 --> 01:17:37,060
- Wow!
- I'll bet it's very exclusive.

1226
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:39,520
Probably need a credit reference
just to get in the pool.

1227
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:41,281
- Oh.
- Oh.

1228
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:43,893
- Amazing!
- Oh, Nattie.

1229
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:47,870
Not a single body that exists in nature.
Look at that.

1230
01:17:48,172 --> 01:17:50,522
- Lydie...
- There's Stu!

1231
01:17:50,608 --> 01:17:53,095
Where?
Oh. On the board there.

1232
01:17:53,388 --> 01:17:55,934
Oh, isn't he a stunning piece of work?

1233
01:17:56,084 --> 01:18:00,394
Look, Nattie.
That's called liposuction. Hmm.

1234
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:10,092
- Wow!
- Wow!

1235
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:11,834
I hope he had protection, you know.

1236
01:18:11,867 --> 01:18:14,074
He hit the water at that speed,
God knows what happened.

1237
01:18:14,107 --> 01:18:17,102
- Oh, let-let's go say hi.
- Let's do, please.

1238
01:18:17,174 --> 01:18:19,509
- That's amazing.
- Stunning.

1239
01:18:26,627 --> 01:18:27,900
Oh, whoa, whoa!
Hello.

1240
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,145
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! You look lovely!
- Hi.

1241
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:32,488
Oh, guys, I'm so glad
you could make it.

1242
01:18:32,521 --> 01:18:35,070
Oh, by the looks of you,
that water's so cold!

1243
01:18:35,663 --> 01:18:36,816
Yes, well...

1244
01:18:37,614 --> 01:18:40,340
Your tummy looks different
from my daddy's.

1245
01:18:40,587 --> 01:18:42,074
- Oh, Nattie!
- Well.

1246
01:18:42,207 --> 01:18:45,254
Not everyone has
their own personal trainer.

1247
01:18:45,794 --> 01:18:48,237
Well, guys. You got your swimsuits?
You wanna go for a dip?

1248
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:49,537
- Oh, great.
- That'd be great!

1249
01:18:49,604 --> 01:18:53,503
- Good! How about you, Mrs Doubtfire?
- Oh, you wicked, wicked man!

1250
01:18:53,603 --> 01:18:56,933
Isn't there enough flesh here
for you to feast your eyes on?

1251
01:18:56,999 --> 01:18:59,193
Come now, Mrs Doubtfire.
Don't be bashful.

1252
01:18:59,266 --> 01:19:01,533
Oh no, dear. I think
they've outlawed whaling.

1253
01:19:01,613 --> 01:19:05,062
- We'd be re-enacting the Titanic.
- Come on, Mrs Doubtfire.

1254
01:19:05,116 --> 01:19:08,913
Oh, no, no, no. Just go, go. Leave me here.
I'll just sit in the sun and crisp.

1255
01:19:09,023 --> 01:19:11,719
I don't think you can get
heatstroke twice in the same year.

1256
01:19:11,766 --> 01:19:14,766
OK. Well, let's go, kids.
Swim time.

1257
01:19:15,023 --> 01:19:16,399
Go, go, dear.
I'll be fine.

1258
01:19:16,466 --> 01:19:18,553
Come on, come on.
Your day's on me, Mrs Doubtfire.

1259
01:19:18,613 --> 01:19:21,232
- Anything you need, put it on my tab. OK?
- Oh, thank you, dear.

1260
01:19:21,305 --> 01:19:23,982
Touch me again and
I'll drown you, you bastard.

1261
01:19:24,089 --> 01:19:28,462
Oh, I'll just sit here and watch you
move in on my family.

1262
01:19:28,672 --> 01:19:29,972
Hello, hello!

1263
01:19:31,239 --> 01:19:32,019
Hey!

1264
01:19:33,272 --> 01:19:37,682
Oh, God. What am I doing here?
This is beyond obsession.

1265
01:19:37,955 --> 01:19:39,302
Oh, God.

1266
01:19:50,461 --> 01:19:52,134
- Yes!
- Yeah!

1267
01:19:53,907 --> 01:19:55,054
- OK.
- Nice.

1268
01:19:55,281 --> 01:19:56,481
OK, Natalie.

1269
01:20:05,641 --> 01:20:09,451
- Is everything all right, ma'am?
- Fan-bloody-tastic.

1270
01:20:09,710 --> 01:20:11,270
- Can I have another?
- Sure.

1271
01:20:11,410 --> 01:20:12,400
Great.

1272
01:20:12,627 --> 01:20:15,313
- Yes!
- Oh, OK, Chris.

1273
01:20:15,426 --> 01:20:17,267
- Yeah!
- All right, Nattie.

1274
01:20:22,363 --> 01:20:23,076
Hi.

1275
01:20:23,121 --> 01:20:25,044
Soda with a lime, please.

1276
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:37,540
- It's on me.
- No, thanks.

1277
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:48,576
Four iced teas, Todd.

1278
01:20:49,849 --> 01:20:51,879
So, whose rugrats?

1279
01:20:54,789 --> 01:20:56,479
Miranda Hillard's.

1280
01:20:56,589 --> 01:20:58,625
- Miranda Hillard?
- Uh huh.

1281
01:20:58,886 --> 01:21:00,166
The woman I'm seeing.

1282
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:03,753
No kidding? You?
The guy who's never having kids?

1283
01:21:03,852 --> 01:21:07,673
Won't have anything to do with kids?
You won't even date a woman who's got kids.

1284
01:21:08,169 --> 01:21:09,933
People change, Ron.

1285
01:21:10,338 --> 01:21:11,441
I'm pushing 40.

1286
01:21:11,481 --> 01:21:14,228
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life by myself.

1287
01:21:14,278 --> 01:21:16,676
She's got an awful lot
of baggage though. Three kids.

1288
01:21:16,756 --> 01:21:18,996
Three terrific kids.
And I'm crazy about them.

1289
01:21:19,103 --> 01:21:21,249
Especially little Natalie.
Look at her.

1290
01:21:21,302 --> 01:21:23,862
She's a sweetie pie.
Ah!

1291
01:21:24,718 --> 01:21:25,588
God knows.

1292
01:21:25,628 --> 01:21:28,528
They need some kind of a stable
father figure in their life right now.

1293
01:21:28,568 --> 01:21:29,521
Thanks Todd.

1294
01:21:29,561 --> 01:21:31,511
Well, what about their real father?

1295
01:21:31,598 --> 01:21:34,964
Ah, what can I say, Ron?
The guy's a loser. I'll see you.

1296
01:21:35,728 --> 01:21:37,794
Loser?
Oh, yeah?

1297
01:21:43,515 --> 01:21:45,108
Oh, sir!

1298
01:21:45,481 --> 01:21:46,715
I saw it!

1299
01:21:47,062 --> 01:21:50,054
Some angry member of the kitchen staff.
Did you not tip them?

1300
01:21:50,121 --> 01:21:53,807
Oh, the terrorists! They ran that way.
It was a run-by fruiting.

1301
01:21:53,947 --> 01:21:56,308
I'll get them, sir.
Don't worry.

1302
01:22:00,455 --> 01:22:01,501
Oh.

1303
01:22:02,455 --> 01:22:03,488
Oh.

1304
01:22:04,108 --> 01:22:05,488
Good waste of juice.

1305
01:22:06,441 --> 01:22:07,534
Loser.

1306
01:22:10,027 --> 01:22:11,791
What are you looking at?

1307
01:22:43,962 --> 01:22:45,489
Hi, boys and girls.

1308
01:22:46,165 --> 01:22:49,521
Today we'll be talking about dinosaurs.

1309
01:22:49,566 --> 01:22:53,602
It's A Dinosaurus Line!

1310
01:22:53,669 --> 01:22:56,369
Daa, dadadada, dadada.

1311
01:22:56,531 --> 01:22:59,105
And please welcome... the king!

1312
01:22:59,172 --> 01:23:01,558
Dong-dong-dong, dong-dong-dong.

1313
01:23:02,038 --> 01:23:02,990
Dong-dong-dong.

1314
01:23:03,043 --> 01:23:04,438
It's a dinner show.
Dong-dong-dong.

1315
01:23:04,472 --> 01:23:06,839
Hiya! Hi! Where you from?
Hi! I'm gonna make you lunch.

1316
01:23:06,915 --> 01:23:09,285
Thank you very much.
Thank you! All right!

1317
01:23:09,415 --> 01:23:12,475
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your claws together!

1318
01:23:12,625 --> 01:23:17,245
Please welcome...
James Browntosaurus!

1319
01:23:17,368 --> 01:23:18,661

Ah, I didn't know anybody was watching.
I was just playing. I don't think...

1334
01:24:00,971 --> 01:24:02,604
I was watching.
That's funny stuff.

1335
01:24:02,702 --> 01:24:05,565
- Well, thanks.
- I think kids'd like it.

1336
01:24:05,792 --> 01:24:07,998
They'd be entertained and
get some information too.

1337
01:24:08,024 --> 01:24:10,465
Yeah, that's kinda my theory.
I think you could, you know...

1338
01:24:10,525 --> 01:24:13,113
You don't have to play down to 'em,
just play to 'em.

1339
01:24:13,243 --> 01:24:15,514
Listen, I'd like to hear
some more of your ideas.

1340
01:24:15,582 --> 01:24:16,875
My ideas?

1341
01:24:16,955 --> 01:24:20,625
- How about a dinner meeting?
- Wow. OK.

1342
01:24:20,683 --> 01:24:24,158
Next Friday. Bridges Restaurant.
Seven o'clock sharp.

1343
01:24:25,171 --> 01:24:26,814
I'll be there.

1344
01:24:32,488 --> 01:24:34,078
Take five.

1345
01:24:34,265 --> 01:24:36,832
Take five million.
You're dead.

1346
01:24:40,942 --> 01:24:44,092
Well, we've just had our first
home-cooked meal.

1347
01:24:44,299 --> 01:24:45,972
I'm domestic now, huh?

1348
01:24:46,306 --> 01:24:49,495
- This is terrific, Dad.
- You want some more spaghetti?

1349
01:24:49,605 --> 01:24:50,589
No, I'm stuffed.

1350
01:24:50,643 --> 01:24:52,709
How's little garlic bread?
I made it myself.

1351
01:24:52,742 --> 01:24:55,845
Well, I didn't make it myself.
I cooked it, you know. I sliced it.

1352
01:24:55,905 --> 01:24:58,581
- Yeah, it's OK, Dad. Thank you.
- Thanks.

1353
01:24:58,721 --> 01:25:01,745
Hmm. The place looks great.
The food's terrific.

1354
01:25:02,431 --> 01:25:04,361
I'm really proud of you.

1355
01:25:05,232 --> 01:25:06,721
Yeah. Me, too.

1356
01:25:06,831 --> 01:25:08,167
Me, too.

1357
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:13,869
I'll be right back.

1358
01:25:19,931 --> 01:25:22,067
- Thank you for knocking.
- Yeah.

1359
01:25:23,414 --> 01:25:24,621
Whoa!

1360
01:25:24,851 --> 01:25:26,861
Look at this!

1361
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,733
I see you got someone to clean for you.

1362
01:25:29,886 --> 01:25:31,996
- No.
- You?

1363
01:25:33,499 --> 01:25:35,816
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Mom.

1364
01:25:36,475 --> 01:25:39,342
- Are they ready?
- No. They haven't had dessert yet.

1365
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:42,686
- You cooked?
- Yes. I cook, I bake, I sew.

1366
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,280
Thanks to this Amish home study course,
I'm doing quite well.

1367
01:25:46,406 --> 01:25:48,834
- I'm very impressed.
- Really?

1368
01:25:49,068 --> 01:25:52,909
Give me a second chance. OK?
Let me take the kids after school.

1369
01:25:53,639 --> 01:25:56,395
I can't get rid of Mrs Doubtfire.
She's terrific.

1370
01:25:56,449 --> 01:25:57,482
Come on, Miranda.
Why not?

1371
01:25:57,549 --> 01:25:59,769
She's the best thing
that ever happened to us.

1372
01:25:59,991 --> 01:26:04,174
The kids are all doing better in school.
Chris is passing every single subject.

1373
01:26:04,281 --> 01:26:05,087
He is.

1374
01:26:05,190 --> 01:26:08,400
I-I-I find myself getting home early
just to be with them.

1375
01:26:08,433 --> 01:26:10,353
We're all doing so great.

1376
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:11,919
P... Oh!

1377
01:26:12,298 --> 01:26:14,858
Sounds like an amazing woman.
Too good to be true.

1378
01:26:15,067 --> 01:26:16,394
She is.

1379
01:26:24,909 --> 01:26:27,482
- I kinda like the black one.
- Me, too.

1380
01:26:28,048 --> 01:26:30,408
I don't know.
Actually... Mrs Doubtfire!

1381
01:26:30,578 --> 01:26:32,777
- Yes?
- We need another woman's opinion.

1382
01:26:32,877 --> 01:26:34,938
Oh!
Then I'm your woman.

1383
01:26:35,048 --> 01:26:36,151
Which one?

1384
01:26:36,698 --> 01:26:38,058
What's the occasion?

1385
01:26:38,104 --> 01:26:40,518
- It's my birthday.
- Oh!

1386
01:26:40,658 --> 01:26:42,384
Stu's taking me out to dinner.

1387
01:26:42,431 --> 01:26:43,504
Oh!

1388
01:26:45,258 --> 01:26:47,157
- Neither.
- Neither?

1389
01:26:47,257 --> 01:26:50,551
They're both too brazen, dear.
They cry "harlot", really.

1390
01:26:50,598 --> 01:26:53,461
I mean, the red one is the traditional
color for streetwalkers, dear.

1391
01:26:53,594 --> 01:26:57,108
And the black one is far too short.
I hope you waxed.

1392
01:26:57,221 --> 01:27:00,330
They both say to me "I'm easy."
And you don't want that, do you?

1393
01:27:00,377 --> 01:27:03,529
You want to be Kilimanjaro
on your first date - inaccessible.

1394
01:27:03,673 --> 01:27:06,377
Why buy the cow
when you can get the milk for free?

1395
01:27:06,477 --> 01:27:09,917
No, let's find something
more your own age, all right?

1396
01:27:10,047 --> 01:27:12,077
Something a little less tawdry.

1397
01:27:12,533 --> 01:27:14,340
Oh, let's see.

1398
01:27:15,086 --> 01:27:18,456
How about this lovely frock?
Tasteful, elegant...

1399
01:27:18,802 --> 01:27:20,536
Don't you think?

1400
01:27:20,857 --> 01:27:24,573
And old. I wore that
to my aunt's funeral in 1976.

1401
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:27,900
Well, the classic never dies, dear.
I think it's time to revive it.

1402
01:27:27,966 --> 01:27:29,869
- Well, I think we should ask the kids.
- All right, let's do that.

1403
01:27:29,903 --> 01:27:31,049
What do you think?

1404
01:27:31,162 --> 01:27:33,602
I'd go with the short, black one.

1405
01:27:33,976 --> 01:27:35,902
Yeah.
It's the most fun.

1406
01:27:36,419 --> 01:27:38,506
There. You see?
I-I agree.

1407
01:27:38,676 --> 01:27:40,762
Fine.
I get the frock out of here.

1408
01:27:40,882 --> 01:27:42,555
You ask my opinion,
then don't take it.

1409
01:27:42,595 --> 01:27:44,611
I will not be held responsible
for your virtue.

1410
01:27:44,645 --> 01:27:46,831
- Well, you'll be there to protect me.
- Really?

1411
01:27:46,885 --> 01:27:49,321
Stu has invited you and
the children to join us.

1412
01:27:49,388 --> 01:27:52,515
Oh, how lovely!
One big, happy family.

1413
01:27:52,555 --> 01:27:56,038
I wouldn't miss that for the world!
Should be smashing good fun!

1414
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:57,247
Oh, I'm so glad.

1415
01:27:57,347 --> 01:27:59,940
When does this enchanted
evening take place?

1416
01:27:59,994 --> 01:28:02,200
Friday night, seven o'clock.

1417
01:28:02,804 --> 01:28:04,740
- This Friday at seven?
- Yes.

1418
01:28:04,794 --> 01:28:07,154
We're going to my favorite restaurant.
Bridges.

1419
01:28:07,707 --> 01:28:09,580
- Bridges?
- Yes.

1420
01:28:09,975 --> 01:28:12,065
- Friday at seven.
- Bridges.

1421
01:28:12,344 --> 01:28:14,278
Sorry.
Oh, uh.

1422
01:28:14,365 --> 01:28:15,178
Yes.

1423
01:28:15,285 --> 01:28:17,764
- Bridges?
- Yes! Bridges.

1424
01:28:17,934 --> 01:28:20,713
- The restaurant Bridges?
- Friday at seven.

1425
01:28:21,677 --> 01:28:23,110
- I can't.
- Whay not?

1426
01:28:23,151 --> 01:28:25,920
Please, don't.
No, it's bingo night, dear. Cancel it.

1427
01:28:26,034 --> 01:28:29,364
I can't do it. It's my turn to pull
the balls at the rectory. I can't.

1428
01:28:29,464 --> 01:28:31,527
Mrs Doubtfire, please join us.

1429
01:28:31,567 --> 01:28:34,175
- Don't do that...do that, dear.
- I can't have my birthday without you.

1430
01:28:34,215 --> 01:28:37,157
It's so important to me and
the children that you be there.

1431
01:28:37,204 --> 01:28:38,503
You're part of the family now.

1432
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:40,534
I can't have a birthday without you.

1433
01:28:40,581 --> 01:28:43,308
It would mean so much to me
and the children, wouldn't it?

1434
01:28:43,403 --> 01:28:47,813
Please promise you'll come with us,
Mrs Doubtfire. You just have to.

1435
01:28:49,583 --> 01:28:52,074
Who could resist that little face?

1436
01:28:53,584 --> 01:28:54,638
I promise.

1437
01:28:54,832 --> 01:28:56,605
- Thank you!
- Oh.

1438
01:28:57,384 --> 01:28:58,945
Thank you, dear.

1439
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:02,023
- Oh! Are you all right?
- I'm Fine.

1440
01:29:02,163 --> 01:29:04,247
Mmm, let's see..
Nothing.

1441
01:29:04,288 --> 01:29:06,492
- Anything in May?
- Not a thing.

1442
01:29:06,593 --> 01:29:08,218
It doesn't look good.

1443
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:10,598
I'm sorry.

1444
01:29:10,745 --> 01:29:13,338
Mr Lundy is completely booked
for the next two months.

1445
01:29:13,433 --> 01:29:15,363
Listen, I'll meet him
any time, anywhere.

1446
01:29:15,489 --> 01:29:17,576
I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do.

1447
01:29:17,702 --> 01:29:20,553
Please. I can't cancel.
I'll be blowing a huge opportunity.

1448
01:29:20,593 --> 01:29:23,503
Take my advice:
Don't cancel.

1449
01:29:26,812 --> 01:29:28,322
Thank you.

1450
01:29:40,950 --> 01:29:42,190
Pardon me.

1451
01:29:43,562 --> 01:29:45,105
Come along, Nattie.

1452
01:29:45,225 --> 01:29:47,201
- Hi, hello, hello, darling!
- Thank you.

1453
01:29:47,248 --> 01:29:49,015
Shouldn't you cover
your shoulders, Miranda?

1454
01:29:49,042 --> 01:29:50,089
No! I'm fine.

1455
01:29:50,301 --> 01:29:52,602
- Good evening, Mr Lundy.
- Uh, good evening.

1456
01:29:53,182 --> 01:29:54,728
Oh, God.

1457
01:29:55,695 --> 01:29:56,875
Here we go.

1458
01:29:57,035 --> 01:29:59,562
- Mrs Doubtfire, you look wonderful.
- Thank you.

1459
01:29:59,651 --> 01:30:02,119
So is everyone. Come on.
I hope you're all hungry.

1460
01:30:06,691 --> 01:30:08,041
Good evening, Mr Lundy.

1461
01:30:08,094 --> 01:30:10,555
I'm meeting someone.
Has he arrived yet?

1462
01:30:10,721 --> 01:30:12,814
No, I'm sorry.
He hasn't arrived yet.

1463
01:30:12,867 --> 01:30:15,660
But we can seat you.
Smoking or nonsmoking?

1464
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:18,260
- Nonsmoking, please.
- Nonsmoking.

1465
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:22,083
- Tanya will seat you. Table 15.
- This way, please.

1466
01:30:23,309 --> 01:30:26,561
- Uh, reservation. Dunmeyer.
- Yes, sir.

1467
01:30:27,271 --> 01:30:29,314
- Smoking or nonsmoking?
- Nonsmoking.

1468
01:30:29,347 --> 01:30:32,380
- Smoking!
- Mrs Doubtfire, you don't smoke.

1469
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,176
No, I don't.
But I did.

1470
01:30:34,270 --> 01:30:35,123
- Oh.
- Oh.

1471
01:30:35,223 --> 01:30:38,183
Dear, I found the best way to keep
from smoking again and lighting up

1472
01:30:38,249 --> 01:30:40,025
is to be around those who do smoke.

1473
01:30:40,150 --> 01:30:44,856
I have to randomly ingest just a little bit
of nicotine and it steels my wool.

1474
01:30:44,930 --> 01:30:46,546
Oh, and I know you're Mr Health.

1475
01:30:46,593 --> 01:30:48,840
 Bless you for putting
yourself in harm's way.

1476
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:51,469
- Smoking.
- All right. Table 39.

1477
01:30:51,923 --> 01:30:52,870
- Table 39.
- 39.

1478
01:30:52,936 --> 01:30:55,669
- Follow me, please.
- My age! You're a saint.

1479
01:30:56,739 --> 01:30:59,155
Thank you very much
for humoring an old lady.

1480
01:30:59,216 --> 01:31:00,042
Thank you.

1481
01:31:09,561 --> 01:31:11,708
- Oh, he's pissed already.
- Mrs Doubtfire.

1482
01:31:11,875 --> 01:31:12,842
What?

1483
01:31:13,648 --> 01:31:17,948
- Would you like to join us?
- Oh. I thought I saw Clint Eastwood.

1484
01:31:18,088 --> 01:31:21,718
That would make my day!
He is such a stud-muffin.

1485
01:31:21,858 --> 01:31:24,694
Will you excuse me, dear?
I have to check my wrap.

1486
01:31:24,761 --> 01:31:26,124
- Oh, I can do it for you.
- Oh, no, please.

1487
01:31:26,170 --> 01:31:28,544
I'm fine.
I'm quite capable of doing... Oh.

1488
01:31:28,637 --> 01:31:31,817
All right, dear. There-There you go.
All right.

1489
01:31:31,910 --> 01:31:34,760
- Oh, and your bag too, ma'am.
- Drop it!

1490
01:31:35,007 --> 01:31:38,010
Oh, I'm very sorry, dear.
It's my medicine.

1491
01:31:38,107 --> 01:31:41,508
- I-I have to go take my medicine now.
- Well, we have water at the table.

1492
01:31:41,618 --> 01:31:43,454
I can't take it orally, dear.

1493
01:31:43,654 --> 01:31:45,527
Would you forgive me?
I'll be right back.

1494
01:31:45,628 --> 01:31:49,274
- Would you like something to drink?
- Oh, yes. A good stiff Chardonnay.

1495
01:31:49,957 --> 01:31:52,000
I like 'em light and woody.

1496
01:32:01,897 --> 01:32:03,737
 Hello. Bridges Restaurant
 May I help you?

1497
01:32:03,897 --> 01:32:05,357
<i>Yes. My name is Daniel Hillard.</i>

1498
01:32:05,437 --> 01:32:07,697
<i>I believe Mr Lundy is
expecting me for dinner.</i>

1499
01:32:07,773 --> 01:32:09,459
Will you tell him that
I'm running a little late?

1500
01:32:09,513 --> 01:32:11,693
I was caught on traffic,
but I'm on my way.

1501
01:32:11,747 --> 01:32:15,323
- I'll deliver the message personally, sir.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

1502
01:32:22,716 --> 01:32:25,705
Oh, oh, Stu!

1503
01:32:26,019 --> 01:32:27,379
- Oh.
- I hope you like it.

1504
01:32:27,425 --> 01:32:30,599
Oh, it looks gorgeous!
Thank you!

1505
01:32:30,679 --> 01:32:31,679
Oh!

1506
01:32:31,785 --> 01:32:33,885
Did I miss anything?

1507
01:32:34,658 --> 01:32:35,801
Well, yes.
Look.

1508
01:32:35,835 --> 01:32:38,528
This is the gift that Stu gave me
for my birthday.

1509
01:32:38,601 --> 01:32:39,721
Oh!

1510
01:32:40,494 --> 01:32:41,834
Isn't it gorgeous!

1511
01:32:41,861 --> 01:32:42,894
- You like it.
- Is it real?

1512
01:32:42,947 --> 01:32:44,977
It is very real, Mrs Doubtfire.
Very real.

1513
01:32:45,023 --> 01:32:47,477
You can either wear that or
feed a small country.

1514
01:32:47,530 --> 01:32:50,149
That's so nice.
So decadent.

1515
01:32:50,220 --> 01:32:52,387
Mommy, I need to go.

1516
01:32:53,853 --> 01:32:56,786
- Mrs Doubtfire, would you take her?
- No. You.

1517
01:32:57,256 --> 01:33:00,679
- She wants you, dear.
- Well, I'll be right back.

1518
01:33:00,755 --> 01:33:01,845
OK.

1519
01:33:06,794 --> 01:33:08,824
Yes, well then...

1520
01:33:08,964 --> 01:33:12,525
Children, look at that lovely
dessert tray over there.

1521
01:33:12,635 --> 01:33:16,005
Why don't you go over and pick what
you'd like now so they could reserve it?

1522
01:33:16,078 --> 01:33:17,131
All right.

1523
01:33:17,205 --> 01:33:19,235
- We'll be back.
- All right.

1524
01:33:21,374 --> 01:33:23,690
That's a pretty impressive
bauble you got her.

1525
01:33:23,830 --> 01:33:26,157
Huh? Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

1526
01:33:26,534 --> 01:33:27,844
A fella gives a gift like that,

1527
01:33:27,884 --> 01:33:30,750
he wants more than
a piece of her heart, eh?

1528
01:33:31,290 --> 01:33:33,854
Bit of a going-down payment, huh?

1529
01:33:33,930 --> 01:33:37,560
- Excuse me?
- You know, dear. Sink the sub.

1530
01:33:37,724 --> 01:33:40,106
Hide the weasel?
Park the porpoise?

1531
01:33:40,259 --> 01:33:42,185
Bit of the old humpty dumpty?

1532
01:33:42,294 --> 01:33:45,777
 Little Jack Horny?
The horizontal mambo? Huh?

1533
01:33:45,857 --> 01:33:47,063
Mrs Doubtfire...

1534
01:33:47,124 --> 01:33:50,563
The bone dance, eh?
Rumpleforeskin? Baloney bop?

1535
01:33:50,673 --> 01:33:53,202
Bit of the old cunning linguistics?
Huh?

1536
01:33:53,249 --> 01:33:54,436
Mrs Doubtfire, please.

1537
01:33:54,490 --> 01:33:57,477
Oh, dear. I'm sorry for being
a little graphic. Sorry.

1538
01:33:58,317 --> 01:34:00,580
I hope you're up for
a little competition.

1539
01:34:00,694 --> 01:34:01,761
I beg your pardon?

1540
01:34:01,813 --> 01:34:03,993
She's got a power tool
in the bedroom, dear.

1541
01:34:04,107 --> 01:34:07,400
It's her personal jackhammer.
She could break sidewalk with that.

1542
01:34:07,585 --> 01:34:11,023
She uses it and the lights dim.
It's like a prison movie.

1543
01:34:11,081 --> 01:34:13,308
Amazed she hasn't chipped her teeth.

1544
01:34:13,388 --> 01:34:14,621
Oh!

1545
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:17,739
I hope you bring cocktail sauce.

1546
01:34:18,953 --> 01:34:21,801
She's got the crabs, dear.
And I don't mean Dungeness.

1547
01:34:22,672 --> 01:34:25,508
I'm being blunt as a spoon, aren't I?

1548
01:34:25,902 --> 01:34:28,048
Forgive me.
Oh!

1549
01:34:33,169 --> 01:34:35,999
It's the wine.
Oh, gosh!

1550
01:34:36,312 --> 01:34:40,004
Be back in a flash.
All right? My tiny bladder.

1551
01:34:43,555 --> 01:34:45,515
- Mrs Doubtfire!
- What?!

1552
01:34:45,921 --> 01:34:49,891
- You're going into the men's room.
- No! Oh, so it is!

1553
01:34:49,991 --> 01:34:54,001
I do need new glasses, dear.
Sorry!

1554
01:34:56,422 --> 01:34:57,974
Hello!

1555
01:35:27,011 --> 01:35:27,951
Hah!

1556
01:35:28,097 --> 01:35:30,117
Jesus!
God!

1557
01:35:42,299 --> 01:35:45,595
- Excuse me. May I have a menu?
- Of course.

1558
01:35:47,887 --> 01:35:50,817
- What's France like?
- France's very beautiful.

1559
01:35:53,892 --> 01:35:55,776
Thank you very much.

1560
01:35:57,290 --> 01:35:59,219
- Mr Lundy.
- Oh, hi.

1561
01:35:59,359 --> 01:36:02,919
- Sorry I'm late. Did you get my message?
- Yes. Sit down.

1562
01:36:03,029 --> 01:36:05,462
- How about a drink?
- Oh, sure. I'll have what he's having.

1563
01:36:05,516 --> 01:36:06,196
All righty.

1564
01:36:06,269 --> 01:36:08,239
- Double Chivas on the rocks.
- Double Chivas...

1565
01:36:08,336 --> 01:36:10,092
Bring him two doubles so he can catch up.

1566
01:36:10,152 --> 01:36:11,845
Two doubles. All right.
I'll be right back.

1567
01:36:11,898 --> 01:36:14,441
Scotch drinker, huh?
That's my kinda guy!

1568
01:36:14,481 --> 01:36:16,741
Gentlemen, start your engines.

1569
01:36:21,649 --> 01:36:23,662
OK, everybody.
Are we ready to order?

1570
01:36:23,743 --> 01:36:26,702
Yes, I believe we are.
All right, children, fire away.

1571
01:36:26,876 --> 01:36:29,236
Shouldn't we wait for Mrs Doubtfire?

1572
01:36:30,302 --> 01:36:31,599
Yes.

1573
01:36:33,432 --> 01:36:34,652
OK.

1574
01:36:36,152 --> 01:36:37,659
- Hmm!
- Hmm!

1575
01:36:38,721 --> 01:36:40,321
- Ah!
- Ah!

1576
01:36:40,687 --> 01:36:42,813
- Ah hah ha!
- Ah hah ha!

1577
01:36:43,204 --> 01:36:45,397
- Come on.
- How are we doin' over here, OK?

1578
01:36:45,483 --> 01:36:46,310
Oh, yes.

1579
01:36:46,364 --> 01:36:48,283
- One more for you.
- Yeah, yeah.

1580
01:36:52,637 --> 01:36:53,679
Now...

1581
01:36:55,686 --> 01:36:58,617
What can you do to help
the ratings on the kid show?

1582
01:36:58,717 --> 01:37:01,220
Bottom line: Don't patronize kids.
You know.

1583
01:37:01,287 --> 01:37:03,354
They're little people.
You gotta personalize it.

1584
01:37:03,387 --> 01:37:04,927
Make it fun and entertaining.

1585
01:37:04,987 --> 01:37:07,567
If it's something you'd enjoy,
they'd enjoy it. Huh?

1586
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:10,217
- That's what I'm interested in.
- Bingo! Uh huh.

1587
01:37:10,570 --> 01:37:13,263
Well, I wonder what's happened
to Mrs Doubtfire.

1588
01:37:13,317 --> 01:37:17,147
- We could cross over to the news.
- Would you excuse me for a moment?

1589
01:37:17,314 --> 01:37:18,440
But...

1590
01:37:49,365 --> 01:37:52,375
- May I help you, ma'am?
- Yes, dear. Thank you very much.

1591
01:37:52,468 --> 01:37:54,094
Thank you.
Oh, oh!

1592
01:37:54,182 --> 01:37:55,355
- Oh!
- Oh!

1593
01:37:55,441 --> 01:37:56,937
- Oh, my goodness!
- I'm so sorry!

1594
01:37:57,011 --> 01:37:59,704
- Mrs Doubtfire, are you all right?
- It's my fault.

1595
01:37:59,758 --> 01:38:00,678
My fault.

1596
01:38:02,085 --> 01:38:05,145
- Forgive me. Excuse me.
- I'm all right. There we go.

1597
01:38:05,228 --> 01:38:08,061
Thank you.
Oh, let's see here!

1598
01:38:08,122 --> 01:38:09,921
- May I take your order, ma'am?
- Oh, yes.

1599
01:38:09,991 --> 01:38:11,131
Whoa!

1600
01:38:12,524 --> 01:38:16,933
Let's see.
I'll have the poached salmon.

1601
01:38:17,013 --> 01:38:19,840
- Yes, ma'am. And you, sir?
- I'll have the jambalaya.

1602
01:38:19,895 --> 01:38:22,365
And make mine not spicy.
I'm allergic to pepper.

1603
01:38:22,432 --> 01:38:24,019
Not spicy.
Certainly, sir.

1604
01:38:24,134 --> 01:38:26,438
Thank you.
Cheers. Your health.

1605
01:38:37,094 --> 01:38:38,593
Oh, my God.

1606
01:38:39,337 --> 01:38:41,790
So sorry about that.

1607
01:38:42,164 --> 01:38:43,431
Just one moment.

1608
01:38:43,484 --> 01:38:45,544
Carpe dentum - seize the teeth.

1609
01:38:45,623 --> 01:38:47,523
- Let me assist you.
- Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

1610
01:38:47,623 --> 01:38:51,393
A spoon. Oh, how clever.
Wait. I've got it.

1611
01:38:51,523 --> 01:38:53,723
Wait. Back up. There.
Make a pincer.

1612
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:54,983
Come at it from both sides.

1613
01:38:55,056 --> 01:38:58,023
- Together - up, up, up, up. Oh!
- Here we go. That's it. Here we go.

1614
01:38:58,503 --> 01:39:00,524
Thank you.
There it is.

1615
01:39:01,770 --> 01:39:04,029
Oh, just shake them off,
like a dog.

1616
01:39:04,203 --> 01:39:06,262
Sorry.
Oh, forgive me.

1617
01:39:06,372 --> 01:39:08,879
- That's all right.
- Sorry about my spray.

1618
01:39:10,442 --> 01:39:11,772
I'll be right back.

1619
01:39:11,959 --> 01:39:14,566
I just have to re-attach them
with a little adhesive.

1620
01:39:14,678 --> 01:39:17,418
Yes, and tell him to purée
the salmon, if you will, please.

1621
01:39:17,465 --> 01:39:18,285
Purée the salmon.

1622
01:39:18,338 --> 01:39:20,848
Thank you.
Sorry about that.

1623
01:39:27,591 --> 01:39:29,314
Oh, that one.

1624
01:39:34,007 --> 01:39:37,010
Oh. I didn't know there was
someone else in here.

1625
01:39:37,090 --> 01:39:38,403
Sorry.

1626
01:39:44,554 --> 01:39:46,486
Damn it!
Oh, there it is.

1627
01:39:46,767 --> 01:39:47,806
Oh!

1628
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:51,380
Excuse me.

1629
01:39:59,882 --> 01:40:02,042
- Oh!
- Red and this big.

1630
01:40:03,078 --> 01:40:04,345
Argh!

1631
01:40:11,946 --> 01:40:13,053
Mmm.

1632
01:40:13,299 --> 01:40:14,812
Where the hell have you been?

1633
01:40:14,899 --> 01:40:17,632
I took a liberty of ordering
you another Scotch.

1634
01:40:17,711 --> 01:40:18,954
Bully!

1635
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,556
- Daniel?
- Huh?

1636
01:40:27,546 --> 01:40:29,810
Are you wearing ladies' perfume?

1637
01:40:32,390 --> 01:40:33,860
Yes, I am.

1638
01:40:36,952 --> 01:40:39,059
Are you wearing lipstick?

1639
01:40:41,469 --> 01:40:42,465
Yeah.

1640
01:40:43,799 --> 01:40:44,999
Why?

1641
01:40:46,353 --> 01:40:47,565
It rubbed off.

1642
01:40:48,559 --> 01:40:49,692
From whom?

1643
01:40:51,348 --> 01:40:54,188
A girl I used to date.
And she's a waitress.

1644
01:40:54,349 --> 01:40:56,409
- A waitress? Here?
- Oh, yeah.

1645
01:40:57,128 --> 01:41:01,519
On the way to the bathroom...
Couldn't keep her hands off me.

1646
01:41:03,819 --> 01:41:07,415
- You dog!
- You scallywag!

1647
01:41:11,382 --> 01:41:15,029
I got the stretch outside.
Does your girlfriend have a girlfriend?

1648
01:41:15,128 --> 01:41:17,798
- Hey, it's the '90s.
- No, no! I mean...

1649
01:41:18,841 --> 01:41:21,531
Does she have a lady friend for me?

1650
01:41:21,777 --> 01:41:23,958
- Go ahead. Ask her.
- I'll go ask her.

1651
01:41:24,078 --> 01:41:27,191
Go on.
Come on, go get 'em!

1652
01:41:34,489 --> 01:41:36,518
- Hey, Dan! Dan!
- Yeah.

1653
01:41:36,598 --> 01:41:38,665
Hey, I need my order for table 39!

1654
01:41:38,739 --> 01:41:42,612
- Relax. It'll be out in a minute.
- Thank you! Great. Geez.

1655
01:41:47,834 --> 01:41:49,000
39.

1656
01:42:01,701 --> 01:42:03,867
Come on.
Table 39!

1657
01:42:20,296 --> 01:42:21,926
Hot jambalaya!

1658
01:42:33,976 --> 01:42:36,157
- Can I help you, ma'am?
- Oh, sorry I'm late.

1659
01:42:36,254 --> 01:42:39,887
But after all those Scotches
I had to piss like a racehorse. Hmm.

1660
01:42:42,715 --> 01:42:44,874
- Daniel?
- Yeah.

1661
01:42:46,124 --> 01:42:49,857
Why in God's name
are you dressed like a woman?!

1662
01:42:54,724 --> 01:42:56,194
Oh, damn.

1663
01:42:56,907 --> 01:42:58,094
I...

1664
01:43:03,174 --> 01:43:04,297
Well...

1665
01:43:07,861 --> 01:43:10,437
I'd like you to meet
the host of your new show.

1666
01:43:11,221 --> 01:43:12,637
Host?

1667
01:43:13,257 --> 01:43:15,560
Euphegenia Doubtfire, dear.

1668
01:43:16,020 --> 01:43:19,820
I specialize in the education
and entertainment of children.

1669
01:43:22,381 --> 01:43:23,757
Surprise!

1670
01:43:27,624 --> 01:43:29,290
Oh, thank you very much.

1671
01:43:29,633 --> 01:43:32,683
- This looks terrific, heh?
- Where's Mrs Doubtfire?

1672
01:43:32,742 --> 01:43:34,503
Well, I hope the dear lady's all right.

1673
01:43:34,612 --> 01:43:36,352
- Shall we start?
- Yes. Yes.

1674
01:43:36,419 --> 01:43:38,138
Let's start.
I don't want it to get cold.

1675
01:43:38,192 --> 01:43:40,232
- Go ahead.
- Bon appetit, huh.

1676
01:43:41,128 --> 01:43:44,482
All right. Tell me. Why would
Mrs Doubtfire be a good host?

1677
01:43:44,548 --> 01:43:49,573
I'm a hip old granny who could
hip-hop, bebop, dance till ya drop,

1678
01:43:49,649 --> 01:43:52,739
and yo, yo, make a wicked cup of cocoa.

1679
01:44:09,035 --> 01:44:10,089
Stu?

1680
01:44:11,032 --> 01:44:13,788
Oh, he's choking.
He's choking!

1681
01:44:13,862 --> 01:44:17,472
He's choking! Help us! Somebody help!
He's choking! Help us!

1682
01:44:17,612 --> 01:44:19,773
Oh, God!
Oh, oh, God!

1683
01:44:19,883 --> 01:44:22,899
- He's choking here! Call 911!
- Oh, no. I killed the bastard.

1684
01:44:22,939 --> 01:44:23,666
He's choking!

1685
01:44:23,713 --> 01:44:27,615
- Mrs Doubtfire! Help us! He's choking!
- Help is on the way, dear!

1686
01:44:27,852 --> 01:44:30,355
- Mrs Doubtfire!
- Help is on the way!

1687
01:44:30,708 --> 01:44:33,982
- Mrs Doubtfire, he's choking!
- Hold on, dear.

1688
01:44:37,370 --> 01:44:40,892
One more time, dear.
Oh, no. Work with me!

1689
01:44:41,032 --> 01:44:43,420
Come on!
Come on!

1690
01:44:43,502 --> 01:44:44,722
Uh!
Uh!

1691
01:44:44,769 --> 01:44:45,822
My God!

1692
01:44:45,889 --> 01:44:47,422
Uh!
Uh!

1693
01:44:47,569 --> 01:44:49,588
Uh!
Come on.

1694
01:45:01,510 --> 01:45:03,710
I'm all right.
I'm all right.

1695
01:45:03,951 --> 01:45:05,774
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

1696
01:45:05,847 --> 01:45:07,261
Almost lost you.

1697
01:45:13,557 --> 01:45:15,971
- Dad.
- Oh, my...

1698
01:45:18,689 --> 01:45:19,917
Daddy?

1699
01:45:25,653 --> 01:45:27,862
Yeah, honey. It's me.

1700
01:45:28,116 --> 01:45:29,409
Oh!

1701
01:45:30,180 --> 01:45:31,696
Happy birthday.

1702
01:45:32,030 --> 01:45:32,957
Oh!

1703
01:45:34,393 --> 01:45:35,663
Daniel...

1704
01:45:35,869 --> 01:45:37,959
Daniel!
Oh, my God!

1705
01:45:38,590 --> 01:45:41,280
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1706
01:45:41,420 --> 01:45:43,326
The whole time?
The whole time...

1707
01:45:43,386 --> 01:45:46,180
- You would... The whole time?!
- Oh, I'm-I'm sorry, Miranda. Please?

1708
01:45:46,229 --> 01:45:50,052
Don't talk to me!
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

1709
01:45:50,125 --> 01:45:53,190
I have to go. We have to leave now.
I have to leave!

1710
01:45:53,340 --> 01:45:56,129
We have to leave now!
I have to go! We're going.

1711
01:45:59,065 --> 01:46:01,516
- You guys go.
- I'm sorry, Dad.

1712
01:46:02,778 --> 01:46:03,941
Bye.

1713
01:46:05,669 --> 01:46:07,729
Sorry about the pepper.
I was...

1714
01:46:08,088 --> 01:46:09,155
Yeah.

1715
01:46:19,179 --> 01:46:21,312
What are you lookin' at? Show's over.

1716
01:46:27,838 --> 01:46:31,146
Miss Robeson,
do you have any closing remarks?

1717
01:46:31,713 --> 01:46:33,553
Nothing further, Your Honor.

1718
01:46:34,725 --> 01:46:39,093
Mr Hillard, since you've determined
to act as your own attorney,

1719
01:46:39,413 --> 01:46:42,608
you are entitled to make
a closing statement at this time.

1720
01:46:53,058 --> 01:46:56,454
Your Honor, in the past two months,
I've secured a residence,

1721
01:46:56,768 --> 01:46:58,188
I refurbished that residence.

1722
01:46:58,228 --> 01:47:00,881
And made it "an environment
fit for children".

1723
01:47:01,021 --> 01:47:02,121
Those are your words.

1724
01:47:02,634 --> 01:47:04,860
And I'm also holding down a job
as a shipping clerk.

1725
01:47:04,917 --> 01:47:07,537
So I-I believe I met
your requirements.

1726
01:47:08,077 --> 01:47:09,710
Ahead of schedule.

1727
01:47:11,244 --> 01:47:13,067
In regards to my behavior,

1728
01:47:13,817 --> 01:47:15,714
I can only plead insanity.

1729
01:47:16,267 --> 01:47:18,576
Because, ever since my children were born,

1730
01:47:18,686 --> 01:47:21,482
the moment I looked at them,
I was crazy about them.

1731
01:47:21,829 --> 01:47:24,546
Once I held them,
I was hooked.

1732
01:47:25,996 --> 01:47:28,016
I'm addicted to my children, sir.

1733
01:47:28,972 --> 01:47:30,906
I love them with all my heart.

1734
01:47:30,999 --> 01:47:35,489
And the idea of someone telling me I can't
be with them, I can't see them every day...

1735
01:47:36,306 --> 01:47:38,849
It's like someone saying I can't have air.

1736
01:47:39,106 --> 01:47:42,295
I can't live without air,
and I can't live without them.

1737
01:47:43,009 --> 01:47:45,959
Listen, I would do anything.
I just want to be with them.

1738
01:47:46,052 --> 01:47:47,872
You know I need that, sir.

1739
01:47:49,052 --> 01:47:50,852
We have a history.

1740
01:47:52,616 --> 01:47:53,479
And I just...

1741
01:47:53,846 --> 01:47:57,126
They mean everything to me.
And they need me as much as I need them.

1742
01:48:00,095 --> 01:48:01,525
So, please.

1743
01:48:01,755 --> 01:48:03,738
Don't take my kids away from me.

1744
01:48:09,608 --> 01:48:10,864
Thank you.

1745
01:48:21,121 --> 01:48:22,582
Mr Hillard...

1746
01:48:23,432 --> 01:48:26,328
You've been able to fool
a lot of people into believing

1747
01:48:26,362 --> 01:48:28,968
that you're a 60-year-old woman.

1748
01:48:29,484 --> 01:48:30,935
No easy task.

1749
01:48:31,684 --> 01:48:38,287
And your little speech seemed to be
very heartfelt and genuine.

1750
01:48:40,310 --> 01:48:44,233
But I believe it
to be a terrific performance

1751
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:46,799
by a very gifted actor.
Nothing more.

1752
01:48:46,934 --> 01:48:50,373
- No. It's not that.
- The reality, Mr Hillard,

1753
01:48:50,784 --> 01:48:56,177
is that your lifestyle over the past month
has been very unorthodox.

1754
01:48:56,413 --> 01:49:00,101
And I refuse to further subject
three innocent children

1755
01:49:00,153 --> 01:49:03,736
to your peculiar
and potentially harmful behavior.

1756
01:49:04,523 --> 01:49:08,236
It is this court's decision
to award full custody to Mrs Hillard.

1757
01:49:08,324 --> 01:49:09,583
Oh, God!
No, sir. Please.

1758
01:49:09,762 --> 01:49:13,353
You will have supervised
visitation rights every Saturday.

1759
01:49:13,420 --> 01:49:14,882
- Supervised, sir?
- Yes.

1760
01:49:14,992 --> 01:49:18,822
A court liaison will accompany you
when you spend time with the children.

1761
01:49:19,188 --> 01:49:22,331
I am suggesting a period of
psychological testing

1762
01:49:22,391 --> 01:49:25,018
and perhaps treatment for you, Mr Hillard.

1763
01:49:25,899 --> 01:49:29,532
We will re-examine this case
one year from now.

1764
01:49:29,642 --> 01:49:31,566
Thank you.
Court is adjourned.

1765
01:49:46,362 --> 01:49:49,599
I don't do laundry.
I don't do windows. I don't do carpets.

1766
01:49:49,661 --> 01:49:53,646
I don't do bathtubs. I don't do toilets.
And I don't do diapers.

1767
01:49:53,706 --> 01:49:56,631
My children have been potty-trained
for quite some time.

1768
01:49:56,801 --> 01:49:59,431
Well, I don't do washing.
I don't do basements.

1769
01:49:59,571 --> 01:50:02,994
I don't do dinners.
I don't do reading.

1770
01:50:03,994 --> 01:50:04,901
Ah!

1771
01:50:06,081 --> 01:50:10,241
Yes. Well, we have your number.
Thank you so much for coming.

1772
01:50:10,381 --> 01:50:12,941
- We'll be getting back to you.
- Thank you.

1773
01:50:13,051 --> 01:50:14,784
I'll show you to the door.

1774
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:20,790
Yes, here we are.
Please...

1775
01:50:26,370 --> 01:50:29,133
Laura, that shipment
has been delayed three times.

1776
01:50:29,226 --> 01:50:31,570
<i>- Well, shipments are late sometimes.</i>
- Yes, but...

1777
01:50:31,633 --> 01:50:34,013
Laura, I'm not gonna wait
another six months for it.

1778
01:50:34,053 --> 01:50:35,060
<i>OK, I'll try to...</i>

1779
01:50:35,110 --> 01:50:37,169
You do that.
Call me back.

1780
01:50:39,450 --> 01:50:42,540
Oh, guys, please don't be so depressed.

1781
01:50:42,803 --> 01:50:44,626
Everything's gonna be all right.

1782
01:50:45,119 --> 01:50:48,139
- I miss her spaghetti.
- I miss her jokes.

1783
01:50:48,689 --> 01:50:50,549
I miss her stories.

1784
01:50:51,219 --> 01:50:55,350
Don't worry. We will find someone.
There are plenty of people out there.

1785
01:50:55,460 --> 01:50:57,399
Nobody like her.

1786
01:50:59,004 --> 01:51:00,437
All right, I admit.

1787
01:51:00,564 --> 01:51:03,104
Things were a lot nicer
when she was around.

1788
01:51:03,931 --> 01:51:06,160
The house was so warm and cosy and...

1789
01:51:06,241 --> 01:51:08,801
the beds were always made,
and the dinner was...

1790
01:51:09,339 --> 01:51:11,302
She isn't real!

1791
01:51:11,376 --> 01:51:14,083
We have to stop referring to her
as if she were a real person.

1792
01:51:14,169 --> 01:51:17,179
<i>Hello, my dears!</i>

1793
01:51:18,318 --> 01:51:20,978
<i>We have a wonderful show today.</i>

1794
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:24,204
<i>We have Mr Van Zandt
from the Sierra Club,</i>

1795
01:51:24,284 --> 01:51:28,574
<i>and he's going to bring some animals
that are endangered species.</i>

1796
01:51:28,741 --> 01:51:32,234
<i>- Do you know what that means, poppets?
- Wait a minute. Did you say "puppet"?</i>

1797
01:51:32,307 --> 01:51:36,138
<i>Oh, no, dear! Oh, it's Kovacs!
Welcome, Kovacs!</i>

1798
01:51:36,191 --> 01:51:39,760
<i>Hi, guys. Did you say "extinction"?
Did you say something? Something stinks?</i>

1799
01:51:39,827 --> 01:51:42,531
<i>It's not something smelling bad.
I'm talking about the extinction.</i>

1800
01:51:42,585 --> 01:51:45,648
<i>That means when there's no more
of a particular animal.</i>

1801
01:51:45,695 --> 01:51:48,237
<i>- Oh, my God.
- Doesn't that make you a little mad?</i>

1802
01:51:48,308 --> 01:51:50,435
<i>- Makes meery mad!
- Well, tell people about it.</i>

1803
01:51:50,477 --> 01:51:52,807
<i>I'm mad! You know why?
Because next, it's the chimps!</i>

1804
01:51:52,853 --> 01:51:55,487
<i>That's right, there are fewer chimps
in the world than the year...</i>

1805
01:51:55,533 --> 01:51:59,178
<i>Doesn't it make you mad that
humans play your parts in movies?</i>

1806
01:51:59,224 --> 01:52:01,611
<i>- Ooh! Cheated "Planet of the Apes"
- Right.</i>

1807
01:52:01,658 --> 01:52:03,784
<i>Who gets this role? Roddy McDowall!</i>

1808
01:52:03,831 --> 01:52:05,345
<i>- Ooh, wee.
- I'd be better than that!</i>

1809
01:52:05,371 --> 01:52:07,394
<i>I'd be better than Charlton Heston!</i>

1810
01:52:07,474 --> 01:52:09,568
<i>- And your rug is better, too.
- Much better.</i>

1811
01:52:09,597 --> 01:52:12,081
<i>You could fly to Persia on that rug.</i>

1812
01:52:12,740 --> 01:52:14,700
<i>But, you know boys and girls?</i>

1813
01:52:25,788 --> 01:52:28,088
Shall we tell them where
we're going tomorrow?

1814
01:52:28,149 --> 01:52:29,609
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They wanna know.

1815
01:52:29,686 --> 01:52:32,676
Tomorrow, poppets,
we're taking a wonderful trip.

1816
01:52:32,786 --> 01:52:36,222
But you don't have to pack your bags
because we're going in our mind.

1817
01:52:36,276 --> 01:52:41,526
We're going across the Atlantic Ocean
to England, where I came from.

1818
01:52:41,626 --> 01:52:44,465
- You came from England, huh?
- I did, dear. It's a wonderful country.

1819
01:52:44,529 --> 01:52:47,055
- Do you know about England?
- I just know that it's an island.

1820
01:52:47,165 --> 01:52:49,236
It's an island, dear.
And a glorious one.

1821
01:52:49,322 --> 01:52:52,512
Because they have a queen and
they have a royal family.

1822
01:52:52,538 --> 01:52:54,258
Oh! Just like a poker game!

1823
01:52:54,305 --> 01:52:55,438
It's a full house.

1824
01:52:55,465 --> 01:52:57,332
Couple of cards aren't living
at home any more.

1825
01:52:57,372 --> 01:53:00,235
Not any more dear.
Thanks to mobile phones. No, no.

1826
01:53:00,515 --> 01:53:03,075
Do you know what language
they speak in England?

1827
01:53:03,185 --> 01:53:04,148
Pakistani?

1828
01:53:04,195 --> 01:53:07,108
Oh! That's right, Kovacs.
In many stores they do.

1829
01:53:07,188 --> 01:53:10,015
But we'll get into that tomorrow,
boys and girls.

1830
01:53:10,155 --> 01:53:12,995
- You owe me a kiss, Kovacs.
- I'm gonna give you two.

1831
01:53:13,038 --> 01:53:14,598
- All right, dear.
- Here's one on the cheek.

1832
01:53:14,638 --> 01:53:15,578
All right.

1833
01:53:15,665 --> 01:53:20,494
- And here's a monkey bite!
- Oh, you wicked, wicked monkey!

1834
01:53:21,164 --> 01:53:24,764
Well, that's all for today.
Bye-bye.

1835
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:26,500
Cut!

1836
01:53:27,804 --> 01:53:30,504
That's a wrap, folks!
Thank you very much.

1837
01:53:34,759 --> 01:53:38,449
We're a smash!
Number one in our time slot!

1838
01:53:38,496 --> 01:53:39,435
- Yeah?
- Yes.

1839
01:53:39,495 --> 01:53:42,862
Calls from Detroit, Cleveland,
Chicago, Los Angeles...

1840
01:53:42,954 --> 01:53:45,984
- All with offers to syndicate.
- Hollywood!

1841
01:53:46,164 --> 01:53:47,544
- Daniel?
- Whoa!

1842
01:53:47,700 --> 01:53:49,240
- Daniel?
- Yes?

1843
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:51,220
Miranda.

1844
01:53:52,273 --> 01:53:54,054
Could I talk to you?

1845
01:53:55,970 --> 01:53:56,984
Yeah.

1846
01:53:57,653 --> 01:53:59,638
I'll be right out.
Just wait here.

1847
01:54:22,154 --> 01:54:24,237
Welcome to Euphegenia's house.

1848
01:54:25,032 --> 01:54:27,957
A little drafty but...
you know. It's nice.

1849
01:54:31,319 --> 01:54:32,989
What can I do for you?

1850
01:54:35,001 --> 01:54:37,403
First of all, congratulations on the show.

1851
01:54:37,654 --> 01:54:40,624
Oh, thanks. You got to see
the dress rehearsal, you know

1852
01:54:42,044 --> 01:54:44,250
We've... 
The kids...

1853
01:54:45,498 --> 01:54:47,661
We've been watching every day.

1854
01:54:49,352 --> 01:54:51,935
It's nice to know
they can see me every day.

1855
01:54:55,260 --> 01:54:59,739
Look, Daniel. I know it's gonna take
a long time to get over all the fights and

1856
01:55:00,061 --> 01:55:02,725
all the horrible things
we said to each other.

1857
01:55:03,771 --> 01:55:06,201
It's...
It's so hard.

1858
01:55:07,901 --> 01:55:11,554
But I know somehow you and I will be
all right and we'll get through this.

1859
01:55:14,911 --> 01:55:16,506
But the kids...

1860
01:55:17,234 --> 01:55:18,547
I uh...

1861
01:55:19,950 --> 01:55:21,646
I don't wanna hurt our children.

1862
01:55:24,663 --> 01:55:26,563
So what do you want me to do?

1863
01:55:26,921 --> 01:55:31,070
You want me to pretend like everything's
all right? Put on a happy face? Smile?

1864
01:55:32,930 --> 01:55:35,849
Jesus, Miranda.
You took my children away from me.

1865
01:55:36,449 --> 01:55:38,529
I can only see them now with supervision.

1866
01:55:38,612 --> 01:55:42,540
Some woman watches me with the kids
like I'm some sort of deviant.

1867
01:55:42,670 --> 01:55:44,885
If I try to hug them,
she wonders why.

1868
01:55:44,959 --> 01:55:46,566
You know what that's like?

1869
01:55:46,696 --> 01:55:49,573
You just sat there in that courtroom.
You knew the truth. You didn't say a word.

1870
01:55:49,620 --> 01:55:51,800
You let that judge pass
that despicable sentence.

1871
01:55:51,879 --> 01:55:53,629
- I was angry.
- Oh, God.

1872
01:55:53,662 --> 01:55:54,675
Look, you hurt me, too!

1873
01:55:54,702 --> 01:55:57,209
Oh, you ripped my heart out!
And you come back to do it again.

1874
01:55:57,269 --> 01:55:57,969
You lied to us.

1875
01:55:58,042 --> 01:55:58,989
- You know what?
- What?

1876
01:55:59,022 --> 01:56:00,689
I don't wanna do this any more.

1877
01:56:00,719 --> 01:56:03,709
I don't wanna do any more
"who did what to whom".

1878
01:56:07,041 --> 01:56:09,941
Ever since this happened,
I've been trying to make sense out of it.

1879
01:56:10,367 --> 01:56:12,314
And the only thing I know
to be true in my heart

1880
01:56:12,368 --> 01:56:14,581
is that the children were happier

1881
01:56:14,769 --> 01:56:17,279
when Mrs Doubtfire
was a part of their lives.

1882
01:56:17,518 --> 01:56:18,812
Yeah?

1883
01:56:19,952 --> 01:56:20,885
She...

1884
01:56:22,132 --> 01:56:23,798
She brought out the best in them.

1885
01:56:24,724 --> 01:56:26,605
She brought out the best in you.

1886
01:56:26,912 --> 01:56:28,518
And you.

1887
01:56:28,779 --> 01:56:29,679
Yeah.

1888
01:56:33,621 --> 01:56:35,424
They miss her terribly.

1889
01:56:38,388 --> 01:56:40,098
What are you saying?

1890
01:56:40,378 --> 01:56:41,931
Daniel, the kids need you.

1891
01:56:50,890 --> 01:56:52,233
I need them.

1892
01:56:59,604 --> 01:57:03,116
<i>Well, tomorrow we'll have Frank,
who is a make-up artist.</i>

1893
01:57:04,374 --> 01:57:06,480
<i>A big knock at the door.</i>

1894
01:57:06,670 --> 01:57:09,946
<i>Who could that be?
And do we have enough time?</i>

1895
01:57:10,704 --> 01:57:13,284
<i>Mr Sprinkles, boys and girls!</i>

1896
01:57:13,337 --> 01:57:16,100
<i>Hello Mr Sprinkles!
What do you have for me today?</i>

1897
01:57:16,147 --> 01:57:19,513
<i>Mrs Doubtflier,
I've got a letter from Katie...</i>

1898
01:57:21,597 --> 01:57:23,507
It's the new baby-sitter.

1899
01:57:24,665 --> 01:57:27,587
Come on, guys! Come on!
Get up! Let's go!

1900
01:57:29,183 --> 01:57:30,493
Come on.

1901
01:57:32,092 --> 01:57:33,972
It's gonna be all right.

1902
01:57:34,482 --> 01:57:37,312
Chris, wait right over there.
Everybody.

1903
01:57:48,844 --> 01:57:50,389
Daddy!

1904
01:57:52,825 --> 01:57:54,143
Hi.

1905
01:57:55,495 --> 01:57:56,805
What's going on?

1906
01:57:57,192 --> 01:57:59,212
I'm here to pick you up.

1907
01:57:59,628 --> 01:58:03,565
Your dad's gonna take you
for a few hours every day after school.

1908
01:58:04,052 --> 01:58:05,288
Really?

1909
01:58:06,715 --> 01:58:09,548
What about the courts?
That legal stuff.

1910
01:58:09,708 --> 01:58:12,474
- Ask your mom.
- I took care of it.

1911
01:58:13,154 --> 01:58:16,904
No more supervised visits.
No more court liaison.

1912
01:58:17,110 --> 01:58:20,457
- Just us?
- Just us.

1913
01:58:22,762 --> 01:58:23,802
Oh.

1914
01:58:25,342 --> 01:58:26,769
Oh, oh, oh.

1915
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:33,043
Go get Mr Bear.

1916
01:58:33,880 --> 01:58:36,469
- Go get your stuff. Hurry up.
- All right.

1917
01:58:41,313 --> 01:58:44,714
- Would you like to come in?
- No, I'll wait outside.

1918
01:58:45,223 --> 01:58:46,410
OK.

1919
01:58:49,607 --> 01:58:51,157
Thank you.

1920
01:58:56,801 --> 01:58:58,104
See you.

1921
01:59:03,202 --> 01:59:04,909
<i>"Dear Mrs Doubtfire,"</i>

1922
01:59:05,056 --> 01:59:08,509
<i>"Two months ago my mom and
dad decided to separate. "</i>

1923
01:59:08,603 --> 01:59:10,859
<i>"Now they live in different houses. "</i>

1924
01:59:11,180 --> 01:59:14,466
<i>"My brother Andrew says that
we aren't a real family any more."</i>

1925
01:59:14,633 --> 01:59:16,040
<i>"Is this true?"</i>

1926
01:59:16,295 --> 01:59:18,354
<i>"Did I lose my family?"</i>

1927
01:59:18,535 --> 01:59:21,962
<i>"Is there anything I could do
to get my parents back together?"</i>

1928
01:59:23,001 --> 01:59:25,251
<i>"Sincerely, Katie McCormick. "</i>

1929
01:59:27,909 --> 01:59:29,940
<i>Oh, my dear Katie.</i>

1930
01:59:31,593 --> 01:59:33,666
<i>You know, some parents
when they're angry,</i>

1931
01:59:33,807 --> 01:59:36,760
<i>they get along much better
when they don't live together.</i>

1932
01:59:37,201 --> 01:59:40,677
<i>They don't fight all the time
and they can become better people.</i>

1933
01:59:40,831 --> 01:59:44,091
<i>And much better mommies
and daddies for you.</i>

1934
01:59:44,201 --> 01:59:47,157
<i>And sometimes they get back together.</i>

1935
01:59:48,342 --> 01:59:50,551
<i>And sometimes they don't, dear.</i>

1936
01:59:51,142 --> 01:59:52,944
<i>And if they don't,</i>

1937
01:59:53,217 --> 01:59:55,047
<i>don't blame yourself.</i>

1938
01:59:55,773 --> 02:00:00,620
<i>Just because they don't love each other
doesn't mean that they don't love you.</i>

1939
02:00:02,194 --> 02:00:05,443
<i>There are all sorts of
different families, Katie.</i>

1940
02:00:05,861 --> 02:00:09,704
<i>Some families have one mommy,
some families have one daddy,</i>

1941
02:00:09,777 --> 02:00:11,727
<i>or-or two families.</i>

1942
02:00:12,193 --> 02:00:14,930
<i>Some children live with
their uncle or aunt.</i>

1943
02:00:14,984 --> 02:00:19,641
<i>Some live with their grandparents,
and some children live with foster parents.</i>

1944
02:00:19,921 --> 02:00:23,254
<i>And some live in separate homes
and some in separate neighborhoods</i>

1945
02:00:23,307 --> 02:00:25,357
<i>in different areas of the country.</i>

1946
02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:31,923
<i>They may not see each other for days,
weeks, months or even years at a time.</i>

1947
02:00:32,613 --> 02:00:34,673
<i>But if there's love, dear,</i>

1948
02:00:36,390 --> 02:00:38,859
<i>those are the ties that bind.</i>

1949
02:00:39,689 --> 02:00:43,492
<i>And you'll have a family
in your heart forever.</i>

1950
02:00:45,400 --> 02:00:47,712
<i>All my love to you, poppet.</i>

1951
02:00:47,900 --> 02:00:49,750
<i>You're going to be all right.</i>

1952
02:00:52,205 --> 02:00:53,830
<i>Bye-bye.</i>
