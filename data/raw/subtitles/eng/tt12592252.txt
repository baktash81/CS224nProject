- I have a question for you.
- Yes?

105
00:04:58,332 --> 00:05:01,802
So, I was wondering
about the whole Ellie thing.

Yeah, what about it?

107
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,540
So, her mom says
that it's fine

108
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:10,878
if she comes and hangs out
for a little while.

109

I'm sorry. You know
we can't have people over.

00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,087
Call Sanitation on two 12-year-olds?
Have them take us to the zone?

113
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:24,023
You keep pushing it,
and you might just find out.

114
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,826
Did you take your vitamins?

115
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,294

I'll call you tonight?

349
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:03,810
I don't know. I think I have
to check my busy schedule,

350
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:06,280

I can make it work.

<i>You miss it, Dozer,
the way things were?</i>

365
00:20:35,536 --> 00:20:39,273
I was on lockdown long

people are...</i>

369

They see you, they put
their face in their phones.

370
00:20:51,385 --> 00:20:53,454
They don't want
to have to face that.

371
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:59,025
Somewhere down the line,
I just...

372
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:01,628
stopped going out.

373
00:21:03,497 --> 00:21:04,698

[May] <i>Wow.
You're a pro at lockdowns.</i>

377
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:17,378
This must be a cakewalk

<i>Is it as bad as it seems
out there?</i>

382
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:34,862
It's worse. It's way worse.

383
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:37,731
<i>But it pays the bills.</i>

384
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:43,103
[man in film] <i>Three thousand dollars.
It might as well have been three million.</i>

[woman] <i>What's the matter
with you tonight?</i>

386
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,242

<i>How'd you like to go to...</i>

388
00:21:49,877 --> 00:21:51,378
I feel like
I'm at the theater.

389
00:21:51,512 --> 00:21:54,381
Yeah, you kinda
have to squint a little,

390
00:21:54,515 --> 00:21:57,584
but, I mean, it's basically
like Mann's Chinese out here.

391
00:21:58,185 --> 00:22:00,788
Mmm. That was my favorite one.

392
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,824
You know I used to go there
every Friday for matinees, right?

393
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:08,462
Do you think that maybe we were
there for the same showings?

394
00:22:08,595 --> 00:22:12,566
I did remember seeing this really hot
girl that I was too scared to talk to.

395
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:15,169
You're full of shit.

You really emptied
that place out, huh?

399
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:24,711
Oh, there's nothing left.
Everything's here.

400
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:26,914
I could make a law firm
out of my house right now.

401
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:30,918
I have paper, paper clips, binders,
highlighters, a hole punch.

402

[woman in film] <i>There'll be
thousands of dollars there.</i>

00:22:43,263 --> 00:22:45,965
would you mind telling the guy in front
if he could please remove his hat?

you could go places.

Who are you?

1067
01:10:45,078 --> 01:10:48,515
Before this shit started
to hit the fan,

1068
01:10:48,649 --> 01:10:53,920
I used to drive garbage trucks
for the Department of Sanitation.

1069
01:10:54,822 --> 01:10:58,592
Then all of a sudden,
my superiors...

1070
01:10:58,726 --> 01:11:00,661
they started to die off.

1072
01:11:02,696 --> 01:11:04,231
And then one day,

1073
01:11:04,365 --> 01:11:09,068
I was running
the whole damn department.

1074
01:11:09,203 --> 01:11:11,871
[laughs] I did it. Four aces.

1075

Emmett D. Harland,
once a lowly refuse collector,

1078
01:11:22,383 --> 01:11:26,787
is now the thin blue line
between death...

1079
01:11:26,919 --> 01:11:30,791
[chuckles]
and a miserable existence.

1080
01:11:30,923 --> 01:11:33,360
Hey, uh, what about yourself?

1081
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:36,163
What did you do
before the fall?

1082
01:11:37,564 --> 01:11:39,199
I was a paralegal.

1083
01:11:40,334 --> 01:11:42,403
I was putting myself
through law school.

1084
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:44,405
Oh.

1085
01:11:44,538 --> 01:11:47,207
Well, I guess it didn't
work out for everybody.

1086
01:11:48,208 --> 01:11:50,344
That's your problem, Nico.

1087
01:11:51,178 --> 01:11:55,115
You don't seem
to understand how good...

1088

us munies have it, huh?

1089
01:11:58,318 --> 01:12:04,291
Only a handful of us, like you and me,
we're allowed to roam around as we like.

1090
01:12:04,425 --> 01:12:08,562
You want a new car? Just go to
the dealership and drive it off.

1091
01:12:08,695 --> 01:12:12,666
Go into a house up in the
hills and just take over.

1092
01:12:13,167 --> 01:12:15,536
We're untouchable.

1093

You see, munies...

1094
01:12:19,139 --> 01:12:22,109
we're not human anymore.

1095
01:12:23,009 --> 01:12:25,913
[chuckles] We're gods.

1096
01:12:26,045 --> 01:12:29,516
And how do you use
your godly power? Huh?

1097
01:12:30,651 --> 01:12:31,919
You run around

1098
01:12:32,051 --> 01:12:37,691
and you try to save some
specimen that is bound to die.

1099
01:12:38,392 --> 01:12:39,927
I mean, what's wrong with you?

1100

Oh, Sara? I don't know.

1103
01:12:48,435 --> 01:12:52,339
She's halfway
to the Q-zone by now, I guess.

1104
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:54,208
