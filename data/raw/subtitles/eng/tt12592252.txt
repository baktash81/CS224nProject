Yeah, what about it?

107

So, her mom says
that it's fine

for a little while.

Call Sanitation on two 12-year-olds?
Have them take us to the zone?

Did you take your vitamins?

I'm at the theater.

Yeah, you kinda
have to squint a little,

390
00:21:54,515 --> 00:21:57,584
but, I mean, it's basically
like Mann's Chinese out here.

391

Mmm. That was my favorite one.

Do you think that maybe we were
there for the same showings?

394
00:22:08,595 --> 00:22:12,566
I did remember seeing this really hot
girl that I was too scared to talk to.

Oh, there's nothing left.
Everything's here.

00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:26,914
I could make a law firm
out of my house right now.

Yeah, right.

Thank you.

- Oh, Jesus.

510
00:29:38,346 --> 00:29:40,580
Harland needs to see me.

511
00:29:40,714 --> 00:29:42,782
- Oh, does he?
- [William] Yeah.

512
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:44,252
Mm.

513
00:29:44,384 --> 00:29:47,687
He has those passes
that we need.

514
00:29:47,821 --> 00:29:49,022
Mm.

515
00:29:52,926 --> 00:29:55,562
So may I leave?

516
00:29:55,695 --> 00:30:01,001
You know, every time you open that door,
you risk letting in what's out there.

517
00:30:01,135 --> 00:30:04,771
Yeah, I know. I also know
that it is the only way

518
00:30:04,905 --> 00:30:07,040
that we are keeping a roof
over our heads.

519
00:30:07,174 --> 00:30:10,043
Those are your words.
Not mine... Jesus.

520
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:14,047
Piper, you think
I want to go out there?

521
00:30:14,514 --> 00:30:16,449
I think you love it.

522
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:23,456
And just because you wear that
bracelet, doesn't make it true.

523
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:30,364
So be a good boy and burn that
sleek little outfit of yours

524
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:33,167

into the house.

Hey...

535
00:31:34,594 --> 00:31:36,796
Do you remember
when we first met,

536
00:31:37,697 --> 00:31:39,433
and you were yelling at me
in Spanish?

537
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:40,800
[chuckles]

538
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,471
I have no recollection
of that.

539

[Nico] I blame
Lester's handwriting.

540
00:31:46,474 --> 00:31:51,178
It said 31,
but I read it as 37,

541
00:31:51,312 --> 00:31:54,514
and I came pounding on
your door like a jackass.

542
00:31:58,152 --> 00:31:59,719
Do you ever wonder
what would've happened

543
00:31:59,853 --> 00:32:02,289
if you knocked
on some other girl's door?

544
00:32:04,024 --> 00:32:06,593
Well, I knock
on a hundred doors a day.

545
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,137
But I've never met
anyone like you.

546
00:32:17,304 --> 00:32:20,840
I'm really glad
Lester messed up that address.

547
00:32:23,377 --> 00:32:24,911
Yeah, me too.

548
00:32:33,254 --> 00:32:34,422
Oh, hey, Mom.

549
00:32:34,587 --> 00:32:36,223
What are you
still doing awake?

550
00:32:36,357 --> 00:32:39,692
I heard voices. Did Dad leave?

551
00:32:39,826 --> 00:32:43,063
Yeah, he had to go out,
but he'll be back.

552
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:46,866
He shouldn't do that.
It's not safe.

553
00:32:48,001 --> 00:32:49,537
I know.

554
00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:54,175
But sometimes we have to do
things we don't want to survive.

555
00:32:59,946 --> 00:33:01,047
Mom...

556
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:05,319
Do you ever wish
I was different?

557
00:33:06,554 --> 00:33:09,022
What? No, sweetie.

558
00:33:09,156 --> 00:33:11,091
What do you mean?

559
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:15,028
Ellie said with you
being immune,

560
00:33:15,162 --> 00:33:17,764
there's a 50% chance
I would be.

561
00:33:17,897 --> 00:33:20,134
- [Piper] Oh, honey.
- And I'm not.

562
00:33:21,402 --> 00:33:23,736
Instead, I'm even weaker
than a normal person.

563
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:26,673
You are not weak.

564
00:33:28,074 --> 00:33:30,743
But if I wasn't like this,
you could go places.

565
00:33:30,877 --> 00:33:32,645
You wouldn't have to
worry about me.

566
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:37,184
And why would I wanna go anywhere
if you couldn't be with me?

567
00:33:39,253 --> 00:33:40,287
Listen to me.

568
00:33:41,654 --> 00:33:43,357
You are perfect.

569
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,992
Absolutely perfect.

570
00:33:46,127 --> 00:33:50,997
And I wouldn't change
one thing about you.

571
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:55,068
And neither would your father.

00:40:55,022 --> 00:40:56,790
Yeah, what do you want?

676
00:40:56,924 --> 00:41:00,059
<i>I would never normally do
this, but it's an emergency.</i>

677
00:41:01,328 --> 00:41:04,598
<i>I need two of these.
I heard maybe you can help me.</i>

678
00:41:07,099 --> 00:41:08,201
<i>Mr. Griffin?</i>

679
00:41:08,335 --> 00:41:10,437
I don't know
what to tell you, kid.

680
00:41:10,571 --> 00:41:15,042
I... I can't get those any more
than anybody else can.

681
00:41:15,175 --> 00:41:16,743
Look, Mr. Griffin,
I have 13 grand.

682
00:41:16,877 --> 00:41:19,246
<i>I know that's nowhere
near enough, but it's all I...</i>

683
00:41:25,185 --> 00:41:27,054
How does he know about us?

684
00:41:27,187 --> 00:41:28,522
I don't know.

685
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:30,424
Who've you been
shooting your mouth off to?

686
00:41:30,557 --> 00:41:32,292
I haven't been shooting
my mouth off to anyone.

687
00:41:32,426 --> 00:41:37,164
Why don't you ask your network,
'cause it's so "reliable"?

688
00:41:37,297 --> 00:41:40,667
- Need I remind you what happens to us...
- No.

689
00:41:40,801 --> 00:41:42,402
...if people find out
what we're doing?

690
00:41:42,536 --> 00:41:44,705
- We go to jail, or even worse...
- You do not. I know.

691
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:46,940
- ...we get thrown into the Q-zone.
- Really?

692
00:41:47,074 --> 00:41:48,809
And then what happens to Emma?

693
00:41:49,776 --> 00:41:53,146
Piper, I told the kid
to go away.

694
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,082
What else
do you want me to do?

695
00:41:55,215 --> 00:41:56,783
I'd like to know
how he knows about us.

696
00:41:56,917 --> 00:41:59,052
Well, why don't you do it?
Why don't you find out?

697
00:41:59,186 --> 00:42:02,456
I'm so sick of cleaning
up your shit.

698
00:42:02,589 --> 00:42:04,658
- Uh, Nico?
- <i>Mrs. Griffin?</i>

699
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:07,294
I think my husband
is just being extra cautious,

700
00:42:07,427 --> 00:42:09,262
but I think I can help you.

701
00:42:10,097 --> 00:42:11,198
Thank you, Mrs. Griffin.

702
00:42:11,331 --> 00:42:16,169
Hey, listen, um,
who told you about us?

703
00:42:16,903 --> 00:42:18,639
<i>Nobody. Nobody told me.</i>

704
00:42:18,772 --> 00:42:21,908
I had nowhere to go, so I came here.
I figured you guys had connections.

705
00:42:23,877 --> 00:42:27,180
[Piper] Listen, we don't have
what you're looking for,

706
00:42:27,314 --> 00:42:30,584
but, um,
I know someone who does.

707
00:42:31,184 --> 00:42:32,452
Marie.

708
00:42:32,586 --> 00:42:34,755
Can I give you what I have?
It's not much.

709
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:40,661
I don't need your money.

710
00:42:41,695 --> 00:42:44,564
[automated female voice]
<i>UV sanitation activated.</i>

711
00:42:44,698 --> 00:42:47,434
<i>Mrs. Griffin, you have
no idea how much this means.</i>

712
00:42:47,567 --> 00:42:49,703
<i>Thank you,
and you're saving a life.</i>

713
00:42:59,479 --> 00:43:01,115
[sanitation man]
<i>It's not done yet.</i>

714
00:43:01,248 --> 00:43:02,983
[Nico] I have a lead.
I'm on my way there now. How's Lita?

715
00:43:03,117 --> 00:43:06,154
She's not good.
There's armed guards outside my door.

716
00:43:06,286 --> 00:43:08,188
[automated female voice] <i>Do
not attempt to leave your home.</i>

717
00:43:08,321 --> 00:43:10,557
[Nico] I'll call you when I have
the passes. Just be ready, okay?

718
00:43:10,691 --> 00:43:11,792
Okay.

719
00:43:27,941 --> 00:43:28,875
Sara.

720
00:43:29,009 --> 00:43:30,410
[in Spanish]

721
00:43:42,556 --> 00:43:44,791
[sobbing chuckle]

722
00:44:20,194 --> 00:44:21,928
[Sara in Spanish]

723
00:44:55,462 --> 00:44:57,430
[machinery whirring]

724
00:45:00,467 --> 00:45:04,205
[man singing opera
in distance]

725
00:45:04,337 --> 00:45:05,639
Hello?

726
00:45:11,311 --> 00:45:12,246
Hello?

727
00:45:12,379 --> 00:45:14,447
[man] <i>âª Maria âª</i>

728
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:20,288
<i>âª Maria âª</i>

729
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:23,657
[operatic singing continues]

730
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:35,502
[sighs, laughs]

731
00:45:35,635 --> 00:45:38,071
It's like La Scala in Milan.

732
00:45:39,307 --> 00:45:40,540
You see, in this country,

733
00:45:40,674 --> 00:45:43,977
most people think
that Puccini is a mushroom.

734
00:45:44,111 --> 00:45:45,979
You want a smoke?

735
00:45:46,113 --> 00:45:47,814
No, I don't smoke.

736
00:45:47,948 --> 00:45:50,117
Do you know
what I love about smoking?

737
00:45:50,251 --> 00:45:55,256
It's nice to know there's something
out there that still can kill you.

738
00:45:55,388 --> 00:45:57,524
[chuckles]

739
00:45:59,693 --> 00:46:02,996
Now, a little bird came
flying, landed on my shoulder,

740
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:07,901
whispered in my ear
that you need two passes.

741
00:46:08,401 --> 00:46:09,936
Yeah.

742
00:46:10,937 --> 00:46:12,072
Follow me.

743
00:46:18,212 --> 00:46:24,252
Don't worry, I'm a regular guy like
you just trying to make a living.

744
00:46:24,384 --> 00:46:26,019
You're a munie, right?

745
00:46:26,153 --> 00:46:29,756
So I assume these passes,
they're not for you?

746
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:33,160
No, my girl's grandma
got sick.

747
00:46:33,294 --> 00:46:35,729
Let's start with the girl.
Age?

748
00:46:35,862 --> 00:46:37,298
Twenty-six.

749
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:40,000
Her full name and social,
please?

750
00:46:44,372 --> 00:46:45,772
I need a name...

751
00:46:46,706 --> 00:46:48,842
because I have to program
these passes.

752
00:46:48,975 --> 00:46:50,043
You with me?

753
00:46:51,511 --> 00:46:53,046
Sara.

754
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,982
I need her full name.

755
00:46:57,385 --> 00:46:59,819
I get it. You gotta be cautious
and you gotta be smart,

756
00:46:59,953 --> 00:47:01,955
especially these days,
you know.

757
00:47:02,088 --> 00:47:05,126
I didn't set up this meeting.
You did.

758
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:08,662
And I'm here
wasting my goddamn time.

759
00:47:08,795 --> 00:47:10,597
If you don't trust me, leave.

760
00:47:11,365 --> 00:47:12,666
No.

761
00:47:13,334 --> 00:47:14,268
I'm good.

762
00:47:14,402 --> 00:47:15,969
You good?

763
00:47:17,037 --> 00:47:23,076
You know, we're kinda lucky
because we're two munies.

764
00:47:23,543 --> 00:47:24,878
I give you my word.

765
00:47:25,011 --> 00:47:28,316
And I would like
to back it up...

766
00:47:28,448 --> 00:47:29,749
the old-fashioned way.

767
00:47:33,453 --> 00:47:35,055
What do you say?

768
00:47:39,693 --> 00:47:40,727
[chuckles] Good.

769
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,396
Feels good, doesn't it?

770
00:47:42,529 --> 00:47:44,698
It's like a childhood memory.

771
00:47:45,399 --> 00:47:48,135
A bite out of
grandma's cookies.

772
00:47:48,902 --> 00:47:50,737
So I need the name
of the girl,

773
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:54,674
and I need the name of whoever
knows about this meeting.

774
00:47:54,808 --> 00:47:56,509
Do you understand?

775
00:47:57,777 --> 00:48:01,514
And I can stick as many holes
in you as I like.

776
00:48:01,648 --> 00:48:03,750
- [Harland shouts]
- [Nico grunts]

777
00:48:07,288 --> 00:48:10,458
[Harland] Come on. Just go in!

778
00:48:15,996 --> 00:48:18,199
[panting]

779
00:48:29,377 --> 00:48:31,811
[gunshots ricocheting]

780
00:49:02,443 --> 00:49:04,211
[sanitation man]
Get on the ground!

781
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:10,984
Come on!

782
00:49:18,192 --> 00:49:19,759
- What's your name, soldier?
- Nico.

783
00:49:19,893 --> 00:49:22,129
- Nico, Boomer.
- Why are you even helping me?

784
00:49:22,263 --> 00:49:24,798
They drag and pull schmucks like
you down here to their death.

785
00:49:24,931 --> 00:49:27,033
Today, I'm drawing a line
in the sand.

786
00:49:27,834 --> 00:49:29,869
I like you, bro.

787
00:49:30,003 --> 00:49:32,306
One dead body down here
stinks up the whole building.

788
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,176
Once you get that smell
in your nostrils, it lingers.

789
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:36,444
You can't blow it out.

790
00:49:36,576 --> 00:49:38,611
Tired of it, man. No more.

791
00:49:38,745 --> 00:49:40,680
- [sanitation man] Over here!
- Shit!

792
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,454
What are you doing?

793
00:50:20,588 --> 00:50:22,189
I'm staying.

794
00:50:22,323 --> 00:50:25,226
Head downstairs.
That'll get you back to the elevators.

795
00:50:27,894 --> 00:50:30,297
Stay safe, pilgrim.
I'm rooting for ya.

796
00:50:30,763 --> 00:50:32,866
Come on!

797
00:50:39,607 --> 00:50:41,342
Oh, jeez.

798
00:50:41,908 --> 00:50:43,910
How hard can it be, guys?

799
00:50:47,281 --> 00:50:49,550
Hey!

800
00:50:49,682 --> 00:50:51,318
[dogs howling]

801
00:50:51,452 --> 00:50:53,653
[ringtone: Lester's voice] <i>Answer
the phone. Answer the phone.</i>

802
00:50:53,786 --> 00:50:55,422
<i>Answer the phone.
Answer the phone.</i>

803
00:50:55,556 --> 00:50:56,789
- [beeps]
- Lester's Gets.

804
00:50:56,923 --> 00:50:59,859
- Distribution...
- Cut the crap. Where is he?

805
00:50:59,993 --> 00:51:01,495
Who are we talking about now?

806
00:51:01,629 --> 00:51:03,497
Your courier, Nico.

807
00:51:03,631 --> 00:51:05,299
He showed up here at my house

808
00:51:05,432 --> 00:51:08,302
and he accused me of
selling black-market passes.

809
00:51:09,203 --> 00:51:11,205
[sighs] <i>Well,
he's not working today.</i>

810
00:51:11,338 --> 00:51:13,641
Don't bullshit me, Lester.
I know you sit there

811
00:51:13,773 --> 00:51:16,443
and watch your guys drive around
all day like rats in a maze.

812
00:51:16,577 --> 00:51:20,381
Just give me his GPS or I'm
gonna take my business elsewhere.

813
00:51:23,683 --> 00:51:26,953
He... Looks like
he disabled his GPS.

814
00:51:27,086 --> 00:51:29,323
<i>I'll let you know
if he comes back online.</i>

815
00:51:29,822 --> 00:51:31,292
Yeah, you do that.

816
00:51:33,194 --> 00:51:33,960
So?

817
00:51:34,093 --> 00:51:36,330
He slipped the leash.

818
00:51:36,463 --> 00:51:38,865
What do we pay Harland for?

819
00:51:38,998 --> 00:51:40,967
He better get this contained.

820
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:42,136
Yeah.

821
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:46,407
[May] <i>So, it was pre-pandemic,
and I met this record exec online,</i>

822
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:49,776
and he saw one of my YouTube
videos, and he invited me out here,

823
00:51:49,909 --> 00:51:51,878
<i>and he told me that
I was gonna be a big star,</i>

824
00:51:52,011 --> 00:51:56,450
and then all the shit hit,
and I got trapped here.

825
00:51:56,584 --> 00:52:00,454
<i>And the record deal that
never existed now was gone.</i>

826
00:52:00,588 --> 00:52:01,754
<i>It was never gonna happen.</i>

827
00:52:01,888 --> 00:52:04,291
He keeps doing
this weird dance with me

828
00:52:04,425 --> 00:52:06,393
like somehow
things are gonna be different,

829
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:10,029
or somehow things are gonna be
the way that they were, but the...

830
00:52:10,164 --> 00:52:13,267
<i>You know that nothing
is ever gonna be the same.</i>

831
00:52:14,635 --> 00:52:16,337
<i>And I'm lonely, you know?</i>

832
00:52:18,405 --> 00:52:19,373
[exhales]

833
00:52:19,506 --> 00:52:21,975
Well, this is nice
and light conversation.

834
00:52:22,109 --> 00:52:24,278
- <i>You know what I mean?</i>
- [laughs, sniffles]

835
00:52:24,411 --> 00:52:27,114
I don't know why
I'm telling you all this.

836
00:52:31,452 --> 00:52:32,785
What's the matter?

837
00:52:32,919 --> 00:52:35,256
- <i>Are you okay? What's going on?</i>
- Nothing.

838
00:52:42,429 --> 00:52:43,664
<i>Is it that guy?</i>

839
00:52:43,796 --> 00:52:45,633
The suit
you were telling me about?

840
00:52:45,765 --> 00:52:48,469
You gonna save me, Dozer?

841
00:52:48,602 --> 00:52:51,538
I don't know if you're kidding
or not. Do you need saving?

842
00:52:51,672 --> 00:52:55,142
- <i>'Cause I'll come over there.</i>
- No, it's okay.

843
00:52:55,842 --> 00:52:57,944
If you got it, you got it.

844
00:52:58,545 --> 00:53:01,348
No, I'm gonna handle it.

You'd be coughing up
your lungs right now,

1067

Before this shit started
to hit the fan,

1068
01:10:48,649 --> 01:10:53,920
I used to drive garbage trucks
for the Department of Sanitation.

1069
01:10:54,822 --> 01:10:58,592
Then all of a sudden,
my superiors...

1070
01:10:58,726 --> 01:11:00,661
they started to die off.

1071

1072
01:11:02,696 --> 01:11:04,231
And then one day,

1073
01:11:04,365 --> 01:11:09,068
I was running
the whole damn department.

1074
01:11:09,203 --> 01:11:11,871
[laughs] I did it. Four aces.

1075

Emmett D. Harland,
once a lowly refuse collector,

1078
01:11:22,383 --> 01:11:26,787
is now the thin blue line
between death...

1079
01:11:26,919 --> 01:11:30,791
[chuckles]
and a miserable existence.

1080
01:11:30,923 --> 01:11:33,360
Hey, uh, what about yourself?

1081
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:36,163
What did you do
before the fall?

1082
01:11:37,564 --> 01:11:39,199
I was a paralegal.

1083
01:11:40,334 --> 01:11:42,403
I was putting myself
through law school.

1084
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:44,405
Oh.

1085
01:11:44,538 --> 01:11:47,207
Well, I guess it didn't
work out for everybody.

1086
01:11:48,208 --> 01:11:50,344
That's your problem, Nico.

1087
01:11:51,178 --> 01:11:55,115
You don't seem
to understand how good...

1088
01:11:55,249 --> 01:11:58,185
us munies have it, huh?

1089
01:11:58,318 --> 01:12:04,291
Only a handful of us, like you and me,
we're allowed to roam around as we like.

1090
01:12:04,425 --> 01:12:08,562
You want a new car? Just go to
the dealership and drive it off.

1091
01:12:08,695 --> 01:12:12,666
Go into a house up in the
hills and just take over.

1092
01:12:13,167 --> 01:12:15,536
We're untouchable.

1093
01:12:16,035 --> 01:12:18,472
You see, munies...

1094
01:12:19,139 --> 01:12:22,109
we're not human anymore.

1095
01:12:23,009 --> 01:12:25,913
[chuckles] We're gods.

1096
01:12:26,045 --> 01:12:29,516
And how do you use
your godly power? Huh?

1097
01:12:30,651 --> 01:12:31,919
You run around

1098
01:12:32,051 --> 01:12:37,691
and you try to save some
specimen that is bound to die.

1099
01:12:38,392 --> 01:12:39,927
I mean, what's wrong with you?

1100

You could have

1102
01:12:45,799 --> 01:12:48,302
Oh, Sara? I don't know.

1103
01:12:48,435 --> 01:12:52,339
She's halfway
to the Q-zone by now, I guess.

1104
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:54,208
I'm sorry.

1105
01:12:54,842 --> 01:12:55,975

- <i>Fair to say you owe me one?</i>
- I'm sorry, man.

1116
01:13:43,089 --> 01:13:46,360
There's a sanitation transport headed
for the Q-zone. I need to find it.

1117
01:13:46,493 --> 01:13:48,128
That ain't gonna be easy.

1118

I've already mapped out every route
from Sara's place to the zone.

1122
01:14:17,089 --> 01:14:18,792
