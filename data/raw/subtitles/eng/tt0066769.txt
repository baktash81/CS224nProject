1
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,590
Piedmont, New Mexico.

2
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,264
Population 68.

3
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,104
Come on.

4
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,452
I didn't notice them before.

5
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,205
That's crazy. I didn't know
buzzards fly at night.

6
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,584
That's what they look like.

7
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,298
Here.

8
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:56,301
Boy, that's some dead burg.

9
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:01,351
Buzzards only come
when something's dead.

10
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,860
Well, I guess we better
go in and have a look.

11
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,335
This is Caper One to Vandal Deca.

12
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,334
Caper One to Vandal Deca.
Are you reading? Over.

13
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,632
Yes, I'm reading. Over.

14
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,841
We're about to enter
the town of Piedmont

15
00:05:34,842 --> 00:05:36,178
and recover the satellite.

16
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,136
Very good, Caper One.

17
00:05:39,137 --> 00:05:40,427
Leave your radio open.

18
00:05:40,428 --> 00:05:43,643
<i>Roger .</i>

19
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:48,140
We're now inside the town.

20
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,766
It's kind of spooky.

21
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,486
I see a church steeple
ahead on the left.

22
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,438
It's quiet here.

23
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,148
It's the damndest thing.

24
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,947
There's no sign of life.

25
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,742
The signals from the satellite
are getting very strong.

26
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,709
Sir! You see that, Lieutenant?

27
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:08,658
See what, Crane?

28
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,038
Over by the fence.
It looks like a body.

29
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,329
Easy, Crane.

30
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,502
You're imagining things.

31
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,126
Holy!

32
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,004
Sir, it's another one.

33
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:22,682
You're right. It looks dead.

34
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,923
Yes, sir, shall I...

35
00:06:23,924 --> 00:06:25,097
No! Stay in the van.

36
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,094
Vandal Deca to Caper One.

37
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,517
What's happening?

38
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,681
We see bodies, lots of them.

39
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,059
Are you certain, Caper One?

40
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,018
Damn it, Com roe,

41
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,692
of course we're certain.

42
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:40,238
Your orders are proceed
to satellite and retrieve.

43
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,411
Roger, Vandal Deca.

44
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,658
Stay at your stations!

45
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:51,912
Hit that security button!

46
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,998
Get me Major Manchek.

47
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,093
Somehow they don't
hardly look dead, Lieutenant.

48
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,629
They're all over the place.

49
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,843
Must be dozens of them.

50
00:07:00,844 --> 00:07:02,589
Damn it, get this call through!

51
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,013
It's sort of like they just

52
00:07:04,014 --> 00:07:05,224
dropped in their tracks, sir.

53
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,300
Sir!

54
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:09,771
Good Chri...!

55
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,354
Do you see that thing in white?

56
00:07:11,355 --> 00:07:12,814
Yeah, it's coming toward us.

57
00:07:12,815 --> 00:07:14,102
Major, this may sound crazy,

58
00:07:14,103 --> 00:07:15,475
but there's something strange

59
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,774
going on with Caper One.

60
00:07:16,775 --> 00:07:19,569
Sir, I think we should get out of h...

61
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,114
Hello, Ops, this is Major Manchek,

62
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,662
Scoop Control A-12.

63
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,744
We need a flyby over
Piedmont, New Mexico.

64
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,998
Infrared. A F.L.l.R scan, all sectors.

65
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:37,998
Film to come direct to Scoop.

66
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,917
Assign Gunner Wilson,

67
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,842
if he's not crocked someplace.

68
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,538
Jeez!

69
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,702
I'm declaring a state of emergency.

70
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,408
All personnel restricted to base.

71
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,118
Everything seen and heard

72
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:56,961
in that room is top secret.

73
00:08:56,962 --> 00:08:57,704
Yes, sir.

74
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,322
This is a recording.

75
00:09:28,323 --> 00:09:29,651
State your name and

76
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,529
your message and hang up.

77
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,280
Major Arthur Manchek,

78
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,625
Scoop Mission Control A-12.

79
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,748
I recommend calling a Wildfire Alert.

80
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,414
We have evidence here on film

81
00:09:39,415 --> 00:09:41,003
of unnatural death caused by.

82
00:09:41,004 --> 00:09:42,624
Scoop <i>7</i> returning to earth.

83
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:46,632
Time check 0-1-4-7 inclusive.

84
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,685
We'd like to see Dr. Jeremy Stone, please.

85
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,598
Well, I'm Mrs. Stone.

86
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,694
We are having a party. May I...

87
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,608
Does that man have a gun?

88
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,775
Ma'am, we must see Dr. Stone.

89
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,198
What is this?

90
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,576
Please call Dr. Stone to the door.

91
00:10:55,577 --> 00:10:57,495
Otherwise we'll go get him.

92
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,038
Just a minute.

93
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,714
I'll just wait here, ma'am.

94
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,837
I'll come to Berkeley anytime, Stone.

95
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,965
That $4 million must be
your largest federal grant.

96
00:11:09,966 --> 00:11:12,339
May I see you, Jeremy?

97
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,926
The S.D.S. Has arrived, no doubt.

98
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,601
Jeremy, there are some
Army types in the hall

99
00:11:18,602 --> 00:11:20,393
and two more outside with guns.

100
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,848
They want to see you.

101
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,350
I'll take care of it.

102
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,853
Jeremy! If you knew about this,

103
00:11:24,854 --> 00:11:25,943
you might've told...

104
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,613
I didn't. I'll explain later.

105
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:33,364
I'm Dr. Stone.

106
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,366
Yes. I'm Captain Morton.

107
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:38,039
There's a fire, sir.

108
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,710
I've got to leave.

109
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,162
For God's sakes, Jeremy!

110
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,581
When will you be back?

111
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:48,624
I'm not sure.

112
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,423
The guns, is it...

113
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:51,967
Mrs. Stone, it's our job

114
00:11:51,968 --> 00:11:53,554
to protect your husband.

115
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,220
From now on, nothing must
be allowed to happen to him.

116
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,973
I'll be safe as in your arms.

117
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,555
Jeremy? Jeremy!

118
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:28,081
You tell the senator it's his daughter!

119
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,047
Allison?

120
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:35,003
Dad, something very
peculiar has just happened,

121
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:35,971
even for Jeremy.

122
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,469
A few minutes ago...

123
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:39,885
Dad, are you there?

124
00:12:39,886 --> 00:12:41,056
What's going on?

125
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,636
This communication

126
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:44,478
is being monitored. The connection

127
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:47,271
has been broken for reasons
of national security.

128
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,899
You will be briefed
at the appropriate time.

129
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,114
Thank you for your cooperation, Mrs. Stone.

130
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,357
I feel like Onassis.

131
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,481
It was the fastest thing
we could arrange, sir.

132
00:13:30,482 --> 00:13:33,025
Thanks.

133
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,822
Yes?

134
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:35,817
General Sparks here.

135
00:13:35,818 --> 00:13:37,192
I just wanted to inform you

136
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,034
that all members of your
team have been cleared

137
00:13:40,035 --> 00:13:41,701
and are now being called in.

138
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,036
Except for Professor Kirke.

139
00:13:43,037 --> 00:13:44,827
He's in the hospital. Appendectomy.

140
00:13:44,828 --> 00:13:46,540
You'll get complete
details on everything

141
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:47,706
when your team is assembled.

142
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:48,701
You don't make sense.

143
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,501
You talk like you've been brainwashed.

144
00:13:50,502 --> 00:13:52,373
You don't understand.

145
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,130
Germ warfare people, Dad?

146
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:55,250
A lab accident?

147
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,127
Thank you.

148
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,676
It's different this time.

149
00:13:57,677 --> 00:13:58,794
Don't pack, Claire,

150
00:13:58,795 --> 00:14:00,264
I won't need anything.

151
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,765
A hippie. He's going to a love-in.

152
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,844
I give up.

153
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,637
One minute you're fed up.

154
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:10,517
You talk about retiring to Alaska yet!

155
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,643
Now you've turned into
a cloak-and-dagger man.

156
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:13,602
My glasses.

157
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:14,650
Here they are, Dad.

158
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,695
Can't you at least tell me who phoned

159
00:14:16,696 --> 00:14:17,906
at this ungodly hour?

160
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,733
Grandpa, there's a car,

161
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,236
and they got guns.

162
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,903
Do they now?

163
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:25,874
Well, that's serious.

164
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:26,788
I'll watch out.

165
00:14:26,789 --> 00:14:28,456
Honey, you've been dreaming.

166
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,081
I wish I were!

167
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:35,582
No. Uh-uh.

168
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,677
Get someone else.

169
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:40,972
Dr. Leavitt, I told you, there's a fire!

170
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,970
My experiment's at the critical stage.

171
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,302
I've been working around the clock.

172
00:14:45,303 --> 00:14:46,894
I can't just leave now.

173
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,729
I want that new plate read

174
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,144
as soon as it's developed.

175
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,396
Yes, ma'am.

176
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,977
My orders come from Dr. Robertson,

177
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,154
the president's science
advisor in Washington.

178
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,943
There's a phone. Pick it up.

179
00:14:57,944 --> 00:14:58,781
Call Robbie.

180
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,822
Tell him I burnt my draft card.

181
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,572
Are you sick, ma'am?

182
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,450
We have a physician on call.

183
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,498
All Dr. Leavitt needs is rest.

184
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,037
Knock it off, Bess.

185
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,632
If the physician certifies that
you are unable to continue...

186
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:18,626
No!

187
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,884
I'm fine.

188
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,595
Relax.

189
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,099
I'm going with you.

190
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,696
Skin knife.

191
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,813
Hold it, Mark.

192
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,606
Sorry to disturb you.

193
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,152
There's just been a call

194
00:15:43,153 --> 00:15:44,494
from a Dr. Robertson

195
00:15:44,495 --> 00:15:45,944
at the White House.

196
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,448
Your orders are to break scrub.

197
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:52,161
Orders? I've got a patient all ready.

198
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,453
Kelly will take over for you.

199
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,328
It's all arranged.

200
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,923
You're expected in the
surgeon's room in 30 seconds.

201
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:38,003
Are you sure the satellite
isn't radioactive?

202
00:16:38,004 --> 00:16:40,921
No. Manchek showed me
the telemetry reports.

203
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,586
Presumably, it could be
some form of space germ.

204
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:48,763
Presumably this stuff is nonporous.

205
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,935
Why did you pick me?

206
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,595
You're an M.D., a talented surgeon

207
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,815
who knows blood chemistries

208
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,432
and you're single...

209
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,351
the "Odd Man Hypothesis."

210
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,320
What the hell is that?

211
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,395
Didn't you read the Wildfire material

212
00:17:03,396 --> 00:17:04,738
I've been sending you?

213
00:17:04,739 --> 00:17:05,401
Very little.

214
00:17:05,402 --> 00:17:07,902
I never went in much
for science fiction.

215
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,779
Nor do I!

216
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,752
It seems to me, General,

217
00:17:22,753 --> 00:17:24,752
Dr. Stone put one over on you.

218
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,551
In fact, he made us all think

219
00:17:26,552 --> 00:17:28,296
his Wildfire Lab could handle

220
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,345
contamination from outer space.

221
00:17:30,346 --> 00:17:33,390
I disagree with the senator from Vermont.

222
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,437
Dr. Stone, a Nobel Prize winner,

223
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,306
twice president of the
National Academy of Sciences,

224
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,105
is well known here in Washington.

225
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,980
Is the implication that Dr. Stone

226
00:17:41,981 --> 00:17:43,355
deliberately misled us?

227
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,898
Perhaps not deliberately, Senator.

228
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,069
I'm reasonably certain

229
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,237
that before the night

230
00:17:49,238 --> 00:17:51,158
the Wildfire Team was mobilized,

231
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,239
Dr. Stone didn't know Scoop existed.

232
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,281
I'm astounded.

233
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:56,410
Reasons of national security.

234
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,242
Very smart.

235
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:00,463
We've had experiences
with scientists before.

236
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:03,542
Now, let's talk about
this famous letter.

237
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:04,874
Dr. Stone sent to the president

238
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:05,751
some two years ago.

239
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,502
From what you're saying,

240
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,801
it was just a shot in the dark?

241
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,425
Perhaps that's a little unfair, Senator.

242
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,975
Dr. Stone and I were
consultants with NASA

243
00:18:14,976 --> 00:18:16,562
on the Lunar Receiving Lab.

244
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,228
He wasn't completely satisfied.

245
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:20,395
He felt a more advanced
lab was required.

246
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,315
You mean more expensive, don't you?

247
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:28,023
I call that Dr. Stone's $90 million
mash note to Uncle Sam.

248
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,820
"In a true biological crisis

249
00:18:29,821 --> 00:18:32,320
which our exploration of
space could bring about,

250
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,286
the present Lunar Receiving Laboratory

251
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:35,497
might prove inadequate.

252
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:41,911
I therefore urge

253
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,381
the establishment of a facility

254
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:45,456
to deal specifically

255
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,460
with an extraterrestrial form of life.

256
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,793
The purpose of this facility

257
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,669
would be to limit the dissemination

258
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,171
of such an unknown organism

259
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,172
from outer space

260
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,640
and to provide laboratories

261
00:18:54,641 --> 00:18:55,601
for its analysis.

262
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,099
I recommend that this facility be located

263
00:18:58,179 --> 00:18:59,599
in an uninhabited region

264
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,974
of the United States,

265
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,401
that it utilize all known
isolation techniques,

266
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,818
and that it be equipped
with a nuclear device

267
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:07,779
for self-destruction in the event

268
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,897
of an emergency.

269
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:12,152
Yours very truly, Jeremy Stone."

270
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,987
Don't encourage the president

271
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,457
to think scientists are wizards.

272
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,203
If things get out of control,

273
00:19:20,204 --> 00:19:21,121
and they might,

274
00:19:21,122 --> 00:19:22,995
even you can't work miracles.

275
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,707
I'd expect to have
your help, Charlie.

276
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,810
Piedmont approaching, gentlemen.

277
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,058
Go over and give us a look first, Dempsey.

278
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,410
I was afraid of that.

279
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,581
The birds'll eat the infected flesh,

280
00:20:04,582 --> 00:20:07,001
and then fly off and
spread the disease.

281
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,924
If it is a disease.

282
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,221
Drop the gas canisters.

283
00:20:20,222 --> 00:20:22,688
Someone's supposed to be alive down there!

284
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,223
Somebody did something.

285
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,147
That's for sure.

286
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:29,396
Let's give it a double dose.

287
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:43,209
That gas will only kill the birds.

288
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,410
Okay, Dempsey, hover
over the main street

289
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:46,503
and drop the ladder.

290
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,920
Do not attempt to land.

291
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:48,835
Is that clear?

292
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,793
Roger. Clearer all the time.

293
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,377
When we climb down,
lift off to 1,000 feet

294
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,174
and hover at a safe distance.

295
00:20:56,175 --> 00:20:57,387
And come back when we signal.

296
00:20:57,388 --> 00:20:58,505
If anything happens to us,

297
00:20:58,506 --> 00:20:59,508
you have your orders.

298
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:04,143
Yes, sir. Proceed directly
to Wildfire and then...

299
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,471
If we're eliminated,

300
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:06,850
the aircraft and pilot

301
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:08,692
will have to be sterilized.

302
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,732
Wait a minute!

303
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,979
That's not what they told me.

304
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,402
Just incinerated.

305
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,617
Coronary?

306
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:09,666
I doubt it.

307
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,620
Hall!

308
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,078
Take a look at this.

309
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,502
Are you sure that isn't coronary?

310
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:57,000
No, coronary's painful.

311
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:58,793
They should grimace.

312
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,013
If it was fast, they wouldn't have time.

313
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,217
Fast? These people were
cut down in mid-stride.

314
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,615
Up there! Look.

315
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,331
An Air Force jet.

316
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,001
If we don't make it to Wildfire,

317
00:24:15,002 --> 00:24:16,711
he'll see the helicopter does...

318
00:24:16,712 --> 00:24:17,750
or shoot it down.

319
00:24:17,751 --> 00:24:19,089
Well, for Dempsey's sake,

320
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,380
we better not slip up.

321
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,483
"The Day of Judgment is at hand.

322
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,984
Have mercy on my soul

323
00:24:41,985 --> 00:24:44,780
and to hell with all
the others. Amen."

324
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:45,483
Senile.

325
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:46,449
This took time!

326
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,491
Regardless of what made her do it,

327
00:24:48,492 --> 00:24:49,454
it took time.

328
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,744
There's a chance someone's still alive.

329
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:01,425
I wouldn't believe you could
commit suicide that way.

330
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,875
Most of them died instantly,

331
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,878
but a few had time
to go quietly nuts.

332
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:07,715
Let's find the damn satellite.

333
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,618
This injury, there isn't any bleeding.

334
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,319
A cut like this... torn veins,

335
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,869
broken capillaries...
should bleed like hell.

336
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,616
Yes. Well, there's no blood

337
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,335
on any of them.

338
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,716
Even where it's chewed, no bleeding.

339
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,370
Hold it, hold it!

340
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:13,536
You'd better back up.

341
00:26:13,537 --> 00:26:15,157
We gotta go to the... left.

342
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:35,431
We're damn close. Bear right.

343
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,956
I'll bet they took it to the doctor.

344
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:18,846
There it is.

345
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,154
The damn fool opened it!

346
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:28,900
Yeah, every country doctor

347
00:27:28,901 --> 00:27:30,274
should run his office

348
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:31,651
like the lunar lab.

349
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:35,283
The capsule first, Hall.

350
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:38,408
We've got about 40
minutes of oxygen left.

351
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,471
Have a look at his buttocks.

352
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,009
That's not funny.

353
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,557
Not meant to be.

354
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,307
Normally blood in a dead person

355
00:28:01,308 --> 00:28:02,850
goes to the lowest points.

356
00:28:02,851 --> 00:28:04,598
There should be marks of lividity.

357
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,694
Do you see purplish marks on his butt?

358
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,691
No.

359
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:16,533
Careful you don't puncture your suit.

360
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:24,336
Clotted blood!

361
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,288
Powdered!

362
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,419
I'll be damned!

363
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,043
No wonder they didn't bleed.

364
00:28:30,044 --> 00:28:32,465
It's clotted throughout
the entire system.

365
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:36,181
Five quarts of blood
turned to powder!

366
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:37,422
In theory, I suppose,

367
00:28:37,423 --> 00:28:39,176
a single organism could do it.

368
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:42,180
But, in fact, there isn't
an organism on Earth...

369
00:28:42,181 --> 00:28:44,602
You mean, there didn't used to be.

370
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,439
I don't...

371
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,989
We heard it all right.

372
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,115
Go away! Go back!

373
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:50,005
Get back! Get out
of here. Go back!

374
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,879
Get away!

375
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,374
This must be the mother.

376
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:32,752
He's scared, and hungry as hell.

377
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,376
Can't be more than six months.

378
00:30:34,377 --> 00:30:36,672
There's probably a
formula in the kitchen.

379
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:37,342
Don't feed it!

380
00:30:37,343 --> 00:30:39,054
He hasn't eaten in
at least 12 hours!

381
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:39,923
We don't do anything

382
00:30:39,924 --> 00:30:40,795
until we get that kid

383
00:30:40,796 --> 00:30:42,092
into a controlled situation.

384
00:30:42,093 --> 00:30:44,090
Maybe feeding is part
of the disease process.

385
00:30:44,091 --> 00:30:46,060
Maybe those who hadn't
eaten lasted longest.

386
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:48,102
Whatever it is, with
our oxygen running out,

387
00:30:48,103 --> 00:30:49,143
we can't take a chance.

388
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,389
Wait a minute.

389
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,558
This is a major break...

390
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,685
a survivor.

391
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,988
Too bad he can't tell
us what happened.

392
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:59,693
Maybe he can... if he lives.

393
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,274
<i>You!</i>

394
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,458
You... you did it!

395
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:52,582
Give me that knife.

396
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:55,037
You're not human.

397
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,712
Everybody's dead.

398
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,255
What happened?

399
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,758
What is it?

400
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,470
What happened?

401
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,899
The town is finished,

402
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,493
contaminated beyond all...

403
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:26,284
Careful, sir.

404
00:32:26,285 --> 00:32:27,949
This is an open transmission.

405
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,287
I'm aware of that, Manchek.

406
00:32:29,288 --> 00:32:30,123
Order up a 7-12.

407
00:32:30,124 --> 00:32:31,913
Only the president...

408
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,742
Precisely. Get on it.

409
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:37,213
The town must be
neutralized immediately.

410
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,804
Has the president made his decision

411
00:32:48,805 --> 00:32:50,393
on Directive 7-12 yet?

412
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,972
He doesn't jump into
things, Dr. Robertson.

413
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,599
First I've got to put together
a briefing for him.

414
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,353
The president's main concern is

415
00:32:57,354 --> 00:32:59,148
the international consequences.

416
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:01,195
What do you think, Mr. Secretary?

417
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,820
It's against the Moscow Treaty of 1963

418
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,819
to fire thermonuclear
weapons above ground.

419
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:10,076
The Russians will have
to be privately informed

420
00:33:10,077 --> 00:33:12,415
we're going to cauterize the area.

421
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,583
Then they'll ask a flock of questions.

422
00:33:14,584 --> 00:33:16,203
Some we don't want answered.

423
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:18,960
That'll take hours.

424
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,043
God knows how far the infection
can spread in that time.

425
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,179
Yes, Chief?

426
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,728
Yes, sir.

427
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:37,771
Yes, Mr. President.

428
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,642
The president's decided

429
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,769
to postpone Directive 7-12

430
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,488
for 24 to 48 hours.

431
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,859
Instead he'll call
out the National Guard

432
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,074
to cordon off the area around Piedmont.

433
00:33:48,075 --> 00:33:49,568
That's your department, Ed.

434
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,536
Safe and sound.

435
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:53,830
It should've been left up

436
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:54,995
to the scientists.

437
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:57,077
It's a colossal mistake.

438
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,913
Tell the president I said so.

439
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,247
No, but...

440
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:04,377
I'll get you an appointment.

441
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,502
By whose decision, General,

442
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:07,971
was the site for Wildfire chosen?

443
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,338
Dr. Stone's.

444
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:12,092
It seemed ideal because
of its remoteness.

445
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,891
There was no inhabited area

446
00:34:13,892 --> 00:34:16,604
near Wildfire for a
radius of 112 miles.

447
00:34:16,605 --> 00:34:18,514
Las Vegas is to the north,

448
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:20,140
Phoenix to the south,

449
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,609
Los Angeles west.

450
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,520
Weren't you worried

451
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:24,146
the infection might spread to them?

452
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:25,103
Yes, sir, I was,

453
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,903
but Dr. Stone and Dr. Robertson

454
00:34:26,904 --> 00:34:28,525
assured the president.

455
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,823
Wildfire was foolproof

456
00:34:29,824 --> 00:34:30,988
because of its device

457
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:32,533
for atomic self-destruct.

458
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:35,115
The military had to
take a backseat.

459
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:51,512
At least they could've
sent a licensed driver

460
00:34:51,513 --> 00:34:53,053
to meet me at that crummy airstrip.

461
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,181
They keep personnel to a minimum

462
00:34:55,182 --> 00:34:56,598
for obvious reasons.

463
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:58,971
You're lost!

464
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:00,347
No one's been down

465
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,442
this goat path for years.

466
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,732
That's how it's supposed to look.

467
00:35:04,733 --> 00:35:06,526
They spent $50,000 on it.

468
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,193
Putting in the potholes?

469
00:35:08,194 --> 00:35:10,362
Getting rid of the tread marks.

470
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,366
Those big tractors leave
a lasting impression.

471
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,573
A lot of heavy equipment
has passed this way.

472
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,663
Where's our leader?

473
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:28,339
We'll catch up to him
and Hall very soon now.

474
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:29,877
Why'd they pick Hall?

475
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:31,211
He's no scientist.

476
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,431
Who needs an overpriced M. D?

477
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,431
Relax and enjoy your cigarette.

478
00:35:37,432 --> 00:35:38,553
It's your last.

479
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,432
It starts here.

480
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,703
It's a great place to grow pot.

481
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,794
Just a plain old crop of barley.

482
00:36:05,795 --> 00:36:08,133
Still, it is rather clever, I think.

483
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:40,868
Something wrong?

484
00:36:40,869 --> 00:36:42,412
I never liked red lights.

485
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:45,245
Reminds me of my years in a bordello.

486
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,965
Howdy.

487
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,046
Howdy-do-dee.

488
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,714
You got the time?

489
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,264
My watch stopped at 11:46.

490
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:00,384
Darn shame.

491
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,183
Must be the heat.

492
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:18,324
It's no fake, believe me.

493
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:19,403
When I retire,

494
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:22,408
I'd like an agricultural
station like this in Alaska.

495
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:24,116
You, a sourdough?

496
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:27,087
Hmph! The sourest. This way.

497
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,626
Step in.

498
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,764
Cute.

499
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,389
The whole thing,

500
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,142
what a world we're making.

501
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:52,066
I can see why the kids are dropping out.

502
00:37:52,067 --> 00:37:53,103
We should've.

503
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,695
It's an emergency, Dutton.

504
00:37:54,696 --> 00:37:56,111
We got tagged. Period.

505
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:59,156
Until I saw those photos
from Van den berg, I...

506
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,403
They brought it on themselves.

507
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,657
Who? The people in Piedmont?

508
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,315
What you said before,

509
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,066
you don't believe the
infection in that capsule

510
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:41,587
was brought back deliberately, do you?

511
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:42,736
Skip it. I hope

512
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,988
I'm talking through my hat.

513
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,035
Put your hands on
that glass, palms down.

514
00:38:47,036 --> 00:38:49,286
It's a finger and palm
print analyzer. it...

515
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:53,044
Reads a composite of 10,000
dermatographic lines.

516
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,540
How'd you know that?

517
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:57,715
Oh, Dutton, I have a
long criminal record.

518
00:38:57,794 --> 00:38:59,419
Then you're in trouble.

519
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,764
This machine has a long memory.

520
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:06,686
It gives you final clearance
to enter Wildfire.

521
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:16,112
Isothermal
reading for M.C. Levels 4 and 5

522
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:20,112
is Z.B. And R.A. Over 2.9.

523
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,029
How's Piedmont?

524
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,197
I had to order up a 7-12.

525
00:39:24,198 --> 00:39:25,194
How are you, Ruth?

526
00:39:25,195 --> 00:39:27,447
No other way to halt
the infection spread.

527
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:27,698
Oh.

528
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:30,122
Oh, you two know
each other, don't you?

529
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,535
By reputation only.

530
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:35,257
Ah, yes, up to now we've
had to worship from a far.

531
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,922
Be good, Ruth.

532
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:45,926
Any messages for me

533
00:39:45,927 --> 00:39:47,472
from the White House?

534
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:50,095
Not a thing, Dr. Stone, or you'd have it.

535
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,473
No personal messages?

536
00:39:51,474 --> 00:39:52,306
No, ma'am.

537
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:53,352
Nothing from Dr. Robertson?

538
00:39:53,353 --> 00:39:54,316
Are you sure, Sergeant?

539
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:58,113
Dr. Stone, sir, I have
one thing to do. Just one.

540
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,647
Everything else is fully automatic,

541
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,117
computerized and self-regulating.

542
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:06,412
I... I listen for a
little bell in here.

543
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,112
Ding-a-ling. That
means a message

544
00:40:08,113 --> 00:40:09,832
coming in is for the Wildfire Team.

545
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,579
Precisely! An M.C.N. Communication.

546
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,543
I'm expecting one.

547
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:14,838
Yes, sir! Top priority.

548
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,122
Ding-a-ling. I push a button

549
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,419
and all five level control
centers are notified

550
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,509
the same time you are.

551
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:22,550
The bell hasn't rung, sir.

552
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:25,052
Thanks for the tour, Sergeant.

553
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:31,145
Dr. Dutton. Thank you.

554
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,686
Will you follow me, Dr. Leavitt?

555
00:40:32,687 --> 00:40:34,398
And may I have your glasses, please?

556
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:34,893
What for?

557
00:40:34,894 --> 00:40:37,394
They'll be treated and
returned to you, Doctor.

558
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,438
They better be,

559
00:40:38,439 --> 00:40:40,109
or I'll need a white cane.

560
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:44,524
Who picked Leavitt?

561
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,698
Talk about the Odd Man Hypothesis,

562
00:40:46,699 --> 00:40:48,153
which we haven't yet.

563
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,747
She's really an oddball.

564
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,745
We're lucky to have her.

565
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:52,914
She's the best equipped of us

566
00:40:52,915 --> 00:40:54,476
to double up for Kirke in microbiology.

567
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:57,162
When dressed,
the team will proceed

568
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,915
directly to conference room 7.

569
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,891
Keep this with you at all times.

570
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:15,394
What's it for?

571
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,472
You're the Odd Man.

572
00:41:16,473 --> 00:41:18,192
The key man, quite literally.

573
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,685
This other key,

574
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:21,645
and Wildfire itself,

575
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:23,694
depend on your key.

576
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,843
Wildfire's equipped
with a nuclear device

577
00:41:45,844 --> 00:41:46,963
for self-destruct.

578
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,171
In an emergency,

579
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,424
it's activated automatically.

580
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,642
I've just inserted the
key in the main station

581
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:53,807
that arms the mechanism.

582
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,980
The device is ready for detonation.

583
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:56,518
When?

584
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:58,812
Never, we hope.

585
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,641
It only goes off if there's danger

586
00:42:00,642 --> 00:42:02,566
of infection breaking out from here.

587
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:05,647
That silver key can't be removed.

588
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:06,442
You're the only one

589
00:42:06,443 --> 00:42:07,691
who can disarm the mechanism

590
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:08,784
by inserting your red key

591
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,453
in one of the substations

592
00:42:10,454 --> 00:42:12,654
located throughout the facility.

593
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,200
There's a five-minute delay

594
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:16,290
between the time detonation locks in

595
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:17,661
and the bomb explodes.

596
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:20,293
That gives
you a chance to think

597
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,669
and, please God, call it off.

598
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:25,127
Look, I'm the new boy here. Why me?

599
00:42:25,128 --> 00:42:26,799
Because you're single.

600
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:30,380
You should have done
your homework, sport.

601
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:35,844
Page 255, Robbie's Odd Man Hypothesis.

602
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:37,597
"Results of testing confirm

603
00:42:37,598 --> 00:42:39,895
the Robertson Odd Man Hypothesis:

604
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,523
That an unmarried male should
carry out command decisions

605
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:45,613
involving thermonuclear
destruct contexts."

606
00:42:45,614 --> 00:42:48,324
Let me take a look at that.

607
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,949
It's of vital importance

608
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,666
that you always know where you are

609
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:01,628
in relation to the nearest substation.

610
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,375
To do that, you have to be familiar

611
00:43:03,376 --> 00:43:04,669
with the entire facility.

612
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:08,710
It can be studied on
this electronic diagram

613
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:11,339
which rotates to afford an overall view,

614
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,637
or can be stopped at any section.

615
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,728
Detailed plans of the
various levels and labs

616
00:43:19,729 --> 00:43:21,565
are also stored in the system.

617
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,944
We're on level 1 of a five-story

618
00:43:27,945 --> 00:43:30,067
cylindrical underground structure

619
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,527
surrounded by solid rock.

620
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,235
Each level has three substations,

621
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:35,864
indicated by the yellow lights.

622
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,915
In the event the nuclear
device is triggered,

623
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:41,411
you can still cancel self-destruct

624
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:43,713
by inserting your red
key in a substation.

625
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:47,050
After our last simulation run,

626
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,376
we decided to add two
more substations per level,

627
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:50,549
but they're not finished.

628
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,552
So don't confuse them
with functioning ones.

629
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,757
At the bottom of the central core

630
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:58,136
is the apparatus for self-destruct.

631
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,735
Each level is a different color

632
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:07,067
based on a navy study

633
00:44:07,068 --> 00:44:08,777
of the psychological effects

634
00:44:08,778 --> 00:44:10,398
of color in environments.

635
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,902
Also, each level is bio-medically cleaner

636
00:44:12,903 --> 00:44:14,366
than the one above it.

637
00:44:14,367 --> 00:44:15,701
We don't want anything

638
00:44:15,702 --> 00:44:17,868
to contaminate a possible organism.

639
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:19,995
That would make it twice as hard

640
00:44:19,996 --> 00:44:21,914
to isolate and characterize.

641
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:25,880
It'll take us 16 hours to descend

642
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:29,298
through the programmed
decontamination procedures

643
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:31,636
on the first four levels to level 5

644
00:44:31,637 --> 00:44:33,378
where the main labs are.

645
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,802
Where, exactly, are we now?

646
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,882
There's one way you can
always locate yourself

647
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:38,974
or any of us instantly.

648
00:44:38,975 --> 00:44:40,639
Simply by calling up projections

649
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,138
from the electronic diagram

650
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:44,891
on any video monitor
anywhere in Wildfire.

651
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:46,897
Views such as this.

652
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:51,813
This shows we're in
conference room 7, level 1.

653
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:54,533
Each of us is indicated by our initial.

654
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:56,405
Our movements are continuously monitored

655
00:44:56,406 --> 00:44:57,654
on the electronic diagram.

656
00:44:57,737 --> 00:44:59,446
Where are the patients?

657
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:01,120
Where's the capsule?

658
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,243
The patients are the yellow X's.

659
00:45:04,244 --> 00:45:06,453
The red circle is the capsule.

660
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:09,331
On level 5, the patients
and capsule will be isolated

661
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:11,005
in biologically secure setups.

662
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,378
Are you sure the old man

663
00:45:12,379 --> 00:45:14,049
and the baby are still alive?

664
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:31,645
What are their chances, Hall?

665
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:32,646
Uncertain.

666
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:34,864
I'm hoping the intravenous dextrose

667
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:36,450
and saline will hold them

668
00:45:36,451 --> 00:45:37,910
until we get to them.

669
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,410
We start decontamination and

670
00:45:40,411 --> 00:45:42,077
immunization procedures now.

671
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,878
You really expect me to fire the thing?

672
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,802
I'm afraid you don't understand.

673
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:57,420
All you can do is stop it.

674
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,921
In a biological emergency,

675
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,176
the bomb is activated automatically.

676
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,925
It'll then go off within five minutes

677
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,395
unless you get to a substation

678
00:46:04,396 --> 00:46:06,640
and lock in your key.

679
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:10,484
Oh.

680
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:15,649
Delta Five to all levels.

681
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:18,858
We are checking out ray-ban
emergency communications.

682
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:19,781
This is a test.

683
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:39,045
Proceed to infrared radiation

684
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,390
decontamination room 1-D.

685
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:47,345
Also it could be an organism

686
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,815
from another planet
released deliberately.

687
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,980
To wipe us out? Really, Charles!

688
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:52,933
Just the opposite.

689
00:46:52,934 --> 00:46:54,276
To make friendly contact.

690
00:46:54,277 --> 00:46:56,238
A kind of messenger to show us

691
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:58,824
life exists elsewhere in the universe.

692
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:01,152
It could be benign in
its own environment.

693
00:47:01,153 --> 00:47:02,574
Pretty far-fetched.

694
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,997
We can't ignore any possibility.

695
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,282
You are about to

696
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:09,160
undergo long-wave radiation.

697
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,618
A buzzer will sound.

698
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,787
Close your eyes and stand still

699
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,631
or blindness may result.

700
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:39,441
We face quite a problem:

701
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,647
How to disinfect the human body,

702
00:47:40,648 --> 00:47:41,614
one of the dirtiest things

703
00:47:41,615 --> 00:47:42,495
in the known universe.

704
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:45,452
That is without killing the
human being at the same time.

705
00:47:45,453 --> 00:47:46,787
It gets tougher as we go.

706
00:47:46,788 --> 00:47:47,996
Hard on the taxpayers,

707
00:47:47,997 --> 00:47:49,617
the way we burn up uniforms.

708
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,702
They're paper.

709
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:53,288
I'd swear it was cloth.

710
00:47:53,289 --> 00:47:54,209
New process.

711
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,038
Where's the next substation, Hall?

712
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,587
Left of elevator on level 2.

713
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,585
Right. Across the corridor
from body analysis,

714
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,054
our next port of call.

715
00:48:02,055 --> 00:48:04,344
Not for my alabaster body.

716
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:05,172
I mean it, Stone.

717
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:07,427
You can take your body
analyzer and you can...

718
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:14,897
Sit down, please.

719
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:23,992
Please look at the screen
in front of you.

720
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:27,362
Please place your body so

721
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:29,741
that all points are obliterated.

722
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,380
That is fine. We may proceed.

723
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,794
State your name for the records.

724
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:43,920
Surname first.

725
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:44,888
Mark Hall.

726
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:47,924
Hall, Mark.

727
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,394
Thank you for your cooperation.

728
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,471
Yes, dear.

729
00:48:56,684 --> 00:49:00,270
Please answer the
following questions yes or no.

730
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:01,818
Have you any allergies?

731
00:49:01,819 --> 00:49:03,487
Yes, to ragweed pollen.

732
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,407
Okay, I'll repeat for
your memory cells...

733
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,446
Please repeat your response

734
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:11,120
for our memory cells.

735
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:14,077
Ragweed pollen!

736
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,622
This ends the formal questioning.

737
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,875
Please undress.

738
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:30,806
This is a scan for fungal lesions.

739
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,228
Dr. Stone, this is level 2 control.

740
00:49:43,229 --> 00:49:44,903
The answer is affirmative.

741
00:49:44,904 --> 00:49:47,817
Major Manchek contacted the White House

742
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,616
at 11:23 this morning.

743
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:54,949
Contact on
all leads is "R" for ready.

744
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,285
Do not be nervous.

745
00:49:57,286 --> 00:49:59,630
I'm not nervous.

746
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:03,171
Physical parameters
are being measured.

747
00:50:03,172 --> 00:50:06,922
There's no need to be nervous, Dr. Leavitt.

748
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,934
Please raise your left arm.

749
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:22,101
Please sit up, facing the scan screen

750
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,729
and watch carefully.

751
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:49,638
You have received pneumatic injections

752
00:50:49,639 --> 00:50:51,382
of booster immunizations.

753
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:53,843
You may get dressed. Thank you.

754
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:56,520
This recording is now ended.

755
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:03,650
That body analyzer!

756
00:51:03,651 --> 00:51:06,441
I want to be there when
the A.M.A. Gets wind of it.

757
00:51:06,442 --> 00:51:07,813
So far it's only been used by NASA

758
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,192
to diagnose astronauts in space.

759
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:12,449
You doctors better start
making house calls again.

760
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:24,289
This is a xenon lamp apparatus.

761
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:27,000
To insure complete effectiveness,

762
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:29,095
spread your feet apart.

763
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:34,801
To protect scalp and facial hair,

764
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,305
place the metal helmet

765
00:51:36,306 --> 00:51:37,804
securely on the head.

766
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:45,393
Make sure the helmet is firmly seated

767
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:47,112
and the visor lowered.

768
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:50,111
Then raise your arms and wait.

769
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:12,467
You may now remove helmet.

770
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:17,643
You will notice a fine
white ash on your body.

771
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:20,765
This is the outer epithelial
layers of your skin

772
00:52:20,766 --> 00:52:22,515
that have been burned away.

773
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:26,775
Please replace the helmet in compartment

774
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:29,238
and proceed through shower in next room.

775
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:32,237
Then you may dress
and descend to level 4.

776
00:52:39,448 --> 00:52:41,540
We're required to rest
for six hours on level 4

777
00:52:41,541 --> 00:52:43,035
after exposure to the xenon lamp.

778
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,212
So go to your rooms and sleep.

779
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:47,878
At the end of the corridor
is the cafeteria.

780
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:50,667
We'll meet there at 0400 hours...

781
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:51,544
tomorrow.

782
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:58,347
Pharmacology
to maintenance L.B.

783
00:52:58,467 --> 00:53:00,686
One of our R.F. S shows six points

784
00:53:00,687 --> 00:53:02,897
over nominal at pressure three.

785
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:09,310
Watchdog to all levels.

786
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,029
Scoop <i>7</i> capsule secure.

787
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:15,155
Bio-check 66 plus 9 minus OL-5.

788
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,383
LEO control to KEEPSAKE 5.

789
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:36,802
The pressure integrity check
runs 2.54 G-CM to the second.

790
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,850
Please confirm.

791
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:15,336
A new form of life.

792
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:20,214
Like Rudolph Karp's bacteria.

793
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:22,058
Fools!

794
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:23,760
They refuse to believe

795
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:25,855
life exists in meteorites.

796
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:29,729
I showed them at the Astrophysics
Conference what I just showed you.

797
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:32,185
But no, even with a microscope,

798
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:33,519
they are blind.

799
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,610
What do I have to do?

800
00:54:34,611 --> 00:54:35,857
Hit them over the head?

801
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:57,049
I'm glad you're amused, gentlemen,

802
00:54:57,050 --> 00:54:59,342
but it might just turn out to be true.

803
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:00,466
During this symposium,

804
00:55:00,467 --> 00:55:01,966
we'll discuss the possibility

805
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:04,559
that intelligent life
on a distant planet

806
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:06,599
may be no larger than a flea.

807
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:11,984
Perhaps no larger
than a bacterium.

808
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,731
Time to wake up, sir.

809
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:21,781
Time to wake up, sir!

810
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,241
Hello?

811
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:30,961
Time to wake up, sir.

812
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:33,871
Who are you?

813
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:36,716
Time to wake up, sir.

814
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:45,132
Do you wish something, sir?

815
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:47,101
Your name.

816
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:50,137
Will that be all, sir?

817
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:52,106
For the moment.

818
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:16,916
This is the answering
service supervisor.

819
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:18,419
We wish you would adopt

820
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,670
a more serious attitude, Dr. Hall.

821
00:56:20,671 --> 00:56:23,263
Sorry. Her voice is quite luscious.

822
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:26,173
The voice belongs to Miss Gladys Stevens

823
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,721
who is 63 years old.

824
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:30,018
She lives in Omaha and makes her living

825
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:32,606
taping messages for
voice-reminder systems.

826
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:35,104
Much obliged.

827
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,476
Let's not get sidetracked
on Rudolph Karp

828
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:38,979
and his meteorite theories.

829
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:41,105
His technique was worthless!

830
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:43,106
I still think we should contact him.

831
00:56:43,107 --> 00:56:44,653
Fair enough. Where is he?

832
00:56:44,654 --> 00:56:45,946
Behind the Iron Curtain.

833
00:56:45,947 --> 00:56:48,197
He couldn't get a research grant here.

834
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:55,880
H.P. Nutrient now
available in the cafeteria

835
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:59,174
for staff members
from sectors 1 through 6.

836
00:56:59,249 --> 00:56:59,999
Hemlock!

837
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,503
All for you, Hippocrates.

838
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:04,634
Not your own venom?

839
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:09,175
Tastes like orange juice.

840
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:11,270
Nutrient 42-5.

841
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:13,143
Developed for the astronauts.

842
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,982
Eight ounces satisfy all daily
nutritional requirements.

843
00:57:16,058 --> 00:57:17,975
Except coffee.

844
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:20,436
And lipid soluble vitamins.

845
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:21,939
For that we have these.

846
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:22,986
Help yourself.

847
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:25,363
So what's the point
of the cafeteria?

848
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,991
Wildfire isn't always on crash status.

849
00:57:27,992 --> 00:57:29,779
Maybe there's some sugar.

850
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:30,028
Nope.

851
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:32,829
Nothing that might provide
a bacterial growth medium.

852
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:34,876
Precisely. No sugar in the gut.

853
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:37,171
I'd like a cigarette right now.

854
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,753
It's after meals you miss them.

855
00:57:38,754 --> 00:57:40,713
You should have no trouble on level 5.

856
00:57:40,714 --> 00:57:43,005
You won't even get
this close to a meal.

857
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:45,632
We'll be entirely on
high-protein nutrients.

858
00:57:45,633 --> 00:57:48,007
I planned our work in three stages.

859
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:50,013
One: Detection.

860
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:52,811
First step is to confirm
that an organism is present.

861
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,136
Two: Characterization.

862
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,515
How is it structured,
how does it work?

863
00:57:56,516 --> 00:57:59,268
Three: Control.

864
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:01,862
How to contain and exterminate?

865
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:04,188
Jeremy, on this matter of extermination,

866
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:05,484
we should go slowly.

867
00:58:05,485 --> 00:58:06,857
Without ever realizing it,

868
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:09,702
we might destroy a highly
intelligent form of life.

869
00:58:09,778 --> 00:58:10,948
Why don't we get going?

870
00:58:10,949 --> 00:58:12,698
I've got two patients down there.

871
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:14,201
The team has two subjects.

872
00:58:14,202 --> 00:58:15,951
They're not guinea pigs, Stone.

873
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:20,836
You may now
proceed to level 5, gentlemen.

874
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:29,672
Stop by your rooms and insert these

875
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:31,846
before taking the elevator.

876
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:34,644
I have risked drowning
in that foul bath.

877
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:35,765
I have been parboiled,

878
00:58:35,766 --> 00:58:37,137
irradiated and xenon flashed.

879
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:38,436
And now you suggest I...

880
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:38,979
I have to!

881
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:41,352
We haven't done anything
about the G.l. Tract yet.

882
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:42,685
On level 5 we must be

883
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:44,688
as nearly germ free as possible.

884
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:49,948
Anyone care to join me for a smoke?

885
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:54,282
Watchdog to level 2, sector D.

886
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,787
You are Red Kappa Phoenix status.

887
00:58:58,035 --> 00:59:00,538
Off the main
corridor on the outer rim

888
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:03,379
are the living quarters,
conference room,

889
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:06,001
cafeteria, bio-safety maintenance, etc.

890
00:59:06,002 --> 00:59:08,085
Inside are the labs.

891
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:10,384
Where is the library?

892
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:11,681
No need for books.

893
00:59:11,682 --> 00:59:13,841
Everything's in the computer.

894
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:16,345
Notice the capsule has
already been delivered

895
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:19,263
by the sterile conveyor system

896
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:22,143
to the main control lab here.

897
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:23,517
Your patients are here

898
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,520
in the hot room of miscellaneous.

899
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:27,821
We can't have any
direct contact with them.

900
00:59:27,822 --> 00:59:28,406
Poor souls.

901
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:31,275
Dr. Dutton
and Dr. Hall are wanted

902
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:33,028
in main control immediately.

903
00:59:34,863 --> 00:59:37,412
Hey!

904
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:39,287
If the patients are sealed off,

905
00:59:39,288 --> 00:59:40,627
how do I get to them?

906
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:42,286
Ever used a glove box?

907
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:42,662
No.

908
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:44,919
Wildfire's gone a step further.

909
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:47,421
Whole rooms that operate
like glove boxes.

910
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:49,424
You'll be working in one shortly.

911
01:00:00,889 --> 01:00:03,057
We have a magnetic "K" indices.

912
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:05,561
Give us a code 3 when you get it.

913
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,538
I wanted you here
while we find out

914
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:25,745
if there's anything still

915
01:00:25,746 --> 01:00:27,420
biologically active in the capsule.

916
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:28,582
Suggestions?

917
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:29,960
Use a buffalo.

918
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:32,262
Audio.

919
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:55,077
Detectors "E"
through "G" correction.

920
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:56,735
Negative "N" scan.

921
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:59,364
Negative "N" scope in L Y-1.

922
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:02,366
Affirmative. "N" indicator in MP-4.

923
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:03,710
I will repeat.

924
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:05,452
Negative "N" scan.

925
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:08,252
Negative "N" scope in L Y-1.

926
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:09,665
Affirmative.

927
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,215
"N" indicator in MP-4.

928
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:36,525
Whatever killed them at Piedmont

929
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:38,620
is still there and
still as potent as ever.

930
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,237
If potent's the word.

931
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:41,785
Let's try a rhesus.

932
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:44,456
Yeah. We'll want
a postmortem on it anyway.

933
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:58,265
Housekeeping to level 5.

934
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,975
Clean sweep schedule "B" now in effect.

935
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:03,010
Germ-free animal technicians,

936
01:02:03,011 --> 01:02:05,059
please consult schedule.

937
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:58,524
So, okay.

938
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:01,529
Isolate and identify.

939
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:04,615
Right. You and I'll scan
the capsule, Ruth.

940
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:07,242
Charlie, you work on these in autopsy.

941
01:03:07,243 --> 01:03:08,710
Open the S.L., Ruth.

942
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:39,106
Adjust S. Y. System

943
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:41,317
for aseptricity as follows.

944
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:42,818
Points 2-A at 5.

945
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,868
Points 9 through 12 at plus 1.

946
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:49,209
Plus 3, plus 6 at minus.

947
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:29,123
Run an initial vector study, Charlie.

948
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,577
Find out how the disease
enters the body.

949
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:35,079
Charlie?

950
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,705
Yes.

951
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:39,291
Yes, the vector study first,

952
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:41,795
then autopsy. Incredible.

953
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:47,009
Dutton, be careful.

954
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:49,265
Let our distinguished surgeon
handle the knife.

955
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:52,429
Fine, but not for a while.

956
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:56,105
First, I'm a pediatrician
and a geriatrist.

957
01:04:56,184 --> 01:04:57,226
Take it easy.

958
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:59,946
Charlie will have a technician.

959
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:15,541
What's been done for them?

960
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:19,255
Just plasma for the old man,

961
01:05:19,256 --> 01:05:20,592
dextrose for the baby.

962
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:22,793
Your therapy?

963
01:05:22,794 --> 01:05:25,217
No. Medcom's.

964
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:27,845
Do I call you Miss Medcom?

965
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:29,591
If you like, Dr. Hall.

966
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,435
My name's Karen Anson.

967
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:34,763
Good. I couldn't cope with two machines.

968
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,482
How does this work?

969
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:37,475
You're lucky.

970
01:05:37,476 --> 01:05:40,519
Medcom's got one of the best minds here.

971
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,111
It's a medical data analyzer

972
01:05:42,112 --> 01:05:44,526
that can diagnose as well as prescribe.

973
01:05:44,527 --> 01:05:47,653
It's hooked up to the
main computer on level 1.

974
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:49,908
Every console and
instrument in Wildfire

975
01:05:49,988 --> 01:05:51,829
is plugged into the main computer

976
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:53,291
on a time-sharing basis.

977
01:05:53,408 --> 01:05:54,532
All our key lab studies

978
01:05:54,533 --> 01:05:56,207
are done on automated machines.

979
01:05:56,208 --> 01:05:58,125
I prefer the personal touch.

980
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:00,753
It's hard to come
by in those suits.

981
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:08,262
Have you worked in them?

982
01:06:08,263 --> 01:06:08,971
Not for real.

983
01:06:08,972 --> 01:06:11,218
But I've been drilling for three months.

984
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:12,516
Thank God for an expert.

985
01:06:12,517 --> 01:06:14,228
This sort of thing's new to me.

986
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:16,346
It's new to all of us.

987
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:19,099
Until now, Wildfire's been like a game.

988
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:22,274
We've even had simulation
biowar games here

989
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:24,822
with live subjects... volunteers.

990
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:29,160
I mean, I'm scared.

991
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:31,954
I never believed
this could really happen.

992
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:33,998
Well, it has happened.

993
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:37,168
I'll need some lab tests.

994
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:54,352
Use this to check off
what you want.

995
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:58,436
Just touch the pen to the screen.

996
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:16,198
You draw the bloods,

997
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:18,327
I'll do the physicals.

998
01:07:21,496 --> 01:07:23,464
Use the bar.

999
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:26,508
The tunnel seals off
automatically behind you.

1000
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:27,921
The only way you might possibly

1001
01:07:27,922 --> 01:07:29,546
break your suit is with a scalpel,

1002
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:32,678
and a surgeon isn't likely to do that.

1003
01:07:57,657 --> 01:07:59,825
Bio-safety to S.L.

1004
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:02,035
An animal in airlock 0-9-5.

1005
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:05,961
Reconfirm red R.D.P.
Status before transfer.

1006
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:49,374
Second scan completed.

1007
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,335
Score, nothing to nothing.

1008
01:08:51,336 --> 01:08:52,679
Go to 100 power.

1009
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,184
No, Ruth.

1010
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:08,903
Use only one micro-scanner.

1011
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:10,065
You being paid by the hour?

1012
01:09:10,066 --> 01:09:12,031
We could cover the capsule
in one half the time.

1013
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:13,447
There's less chance of missing something

1014
01:09:13,448 --> 01:09:14,818
when we both concentrate on one screen.

1015
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:16,025
Let's go directly to the inside.

1016
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:17,825
We can assume they put
the Scoop on the thing

1017
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:19,998
to scoop something into it.

1018
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:22,035
They sure got what
they were looking for.

1019
01:09:22,036 --> 01:09:24,127
We're not here to make accusations.

1020
01:09:24,128 --> 01:09:25,620
We have a job to do

1021
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:27,204
purely as scientists.

1022
01:09:27,205 --> 01:09:28,627
Maybe not so pure.

1023
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:33,465
Continue the scan, Ruth, on the outside.

1024
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:51,436
No, don't do that.

1025
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:53,405
We'll use the hands.

1026
01:09:53,481 --> 01:09:54,526
Nothing can happen, sir.

1027
01:09:54,527 --> 01:09:55,774
I'm faster than the hands.

1028
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:57,823
I want you out of the hot room.

1029
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:06,169
B.Z. Doris to I.Z. Alice.

1030
01:10:06,244 --> 01:10:10,715
S.D.T. Energy output
is 1.8 to 3.0 joules

1031
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:13,750
with rate two to three milliradians.

1032
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:16,049
And we still need those blankets.

1033
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:18,007
No sweat, sir.

1034
01:10:18,008 --> 01:10:19,596
Those cages are airtight.

1035
01:10:19,597 --> 01:10:21,590
I wish you would sweat
a little more, Toby.

1036
01:10:21,591 --> 01:10:25,062
Sweat is a safeguard against some
kinds of bacteria and carelessness.

1037
01:10:25,063 --> 01:10:27,273
Use the hands.

1038
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:56,093
Wow!

1039
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:59,305
Transmitted by air, as we thought.

1040
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:02,016
Now we've got to determine its size.

1041
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:04,435
Could be a gas or some kind of a virus.

1042
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:08,310
We'll use a hundred
angstrom filter to begin.

1043
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:10,525
About the size of a small virus.

1044
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:30,787
All systems go, sir.

1045
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:49,095
Whatever it is,

1046
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:51,144
it's larger than a virus.

1047
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:53,188
We'll try a one micron filter.

1048
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:55,315
Hang in there, baby.

1049
01:12:05,363 --> 01:12:06,578
He must be pretty big.

1050
01:12:06,579 --> 01:12:08,415
I'm gonna get me a fly swatter.

1051
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:09,074
Do that.

1052
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:11,203
Here goes with two microns.

1053
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:25,846
Uh-huh.

1054
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:27,968
Nasty.

1055
01:12:27,969 --> 01:12:30,595
At least we'll be able
to get a good look at it.

1056
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:31,518
Dutton to Stone.

1057
01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:33,480
We've just found out its size:

1058
01:12:33,481 --> 01:12:35,442
About two microns in diameter.

1059
01:12:35,518 --> 01:12:37,646
Big enough to be a complete cell.

1060
01:12:37,647 --> 01:12:38,562
Interesting.

1061
01:12:38,563 --> 01:12:40,657
There's a good chance it's alive.

1062
01:12:40,658 --> 01:12:42,195
Airborne transmission?

1063
01:12:42,275 --> 01:12:44,494
Yes. What have you found?

1064
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:45,491
So far nothing.

1065
01:12:45,492 --> 01:12:47,238
Our Nobel laureate here

1066
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:49,196
won't scan on the inside
because he says...

1067
01:12:49,197 --> 01:12:49,915
All right, Ruth.

1068
01:12:49,991 --> 01:12:51,584
Thanks, Charlie. Keep at it.

1069
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:56,422
It's pointless to go on scanning outside.

1070
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:57,872
If it's two microns in diameter,

1071
01:12:57,873 --> 01:12:59,217
it would've showed up at 440.

1072
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:01,966
True, but we didn't know
that before, did we?

1073
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:04,593
We'll start with five power on the inside.

1074
01:13:04,672 --> 01:13:06,343
Stick to established procedure.

1075
01:13:06,344 --> 01:13:08,809
Establishment gonna
fall down and go boom.

1076
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:09,884
Switch to manual, Ruth.

1077
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:11,354
The interior's too irregular

1078
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:13,313
to probe on automatic.

1079
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,713
More light, huh?

1080
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:26,970
Here's his blood value now.

1081
01:14:31,509 --> 01:14:33,887
Half normal. Severely anemic.

1082
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:41,727
Wake up, sir.

1083
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:45,982
Can you hear me?

1084
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:49,159
What's your name?

1085
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,490
Jackson.

1086
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:56,583
What?

1087
01:14:59,662 --> 01:15:01,585
Jackson.

1088
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:07,465
Stay awake, Mr. Jackson.

1089
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:10,385
Stay awake!

1090
01:15:21,559 --> 01:15:24,187
Tongue blade.

1091
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:27,490
Sixty-eight degrees on 1-4-0-7.

1092
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:29,533
Sixty-one on 1-2-0-3.

1093
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:34,372
Loss rate is minus 0-0-12.

1094
01:15:34,488 --> 01:15:37,913
Please copy and confirm
all receiving locks.

1095
01:15:58,054 --> 01:15:59,599
You can tell you're a bachelor.

1096
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:00,223
What was that?

1097
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:03,025
I didn't say anything.

1098
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:07,817
We're doing an isotope scan.

1099
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:09,192
How the bugs get into the body.

1100
01:16:09,193 --> 01:16:10,440
Thought you should watch it.

1101
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:11,861
I assume it was inhaled.

1102
01:16:11,862 --> 01:16:14,487
Not likely it's absorbed
through the skin.

1103
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,491
That's what we'll find out now:

1104
01:16:16,492 --> 01:16:18,036
The mechanism of death.

1105
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:16,845
We'll look at a
replay of that at speed 6.

1106
01:17:25,933 --> 01:17:28,152
That tells us
what we want to know, Hall.

1107
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:30,311
The organism is inhaled.

1108
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:32,610
The clotting begins in the lungs
and spreads outward.

1109
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:34,818
I didn't think it possible.

1110
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,400
I didn't think the total volume

1111
01:17:36,401 --> 01:17:38,198
of blood could solidify that fast.

1112
01:17:38,199 --> 01:17:39,445
I hoped maybe one crucial clot

1113
01:17:39,446 --> 01:17:40,491
might form in the brain,

1114
01:17:40,492 --> 01:17:42,114
which was what made them go insane,

1115
01:17:42,115 --> 01:17:44,335
and then the rest of the
blood clot more slowly.

1116
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:46,333
We'd have a chance to cure that.

1117
01:17:46,412 --> 01:17:47,083
Cure what?

1118
01:17:47,084 --> 01:17:48,831
We don't know what it is.

1119
01:17:48,956 --> 01:17:52,961
Stone and Leavitt haven't been
able to isolate the hellish thing.

1120
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:55,512
Of course they will in time.

1121
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:00,342
Of course.

1122
01:18:32,499 --> 01:18:34,501
Hold it.

1123
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:41,216
At the edge of that
shadow, I think...

1124
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:43,345
Me too.

1125
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,805
It's an indentation.

1126
01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:52,027
Yes, about the
size of a pencil point.

1127
01:18:52,102 --> 01:18:54,025
Go to 40.

1128
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:04,744
Go to 60.

1129
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:13,248
Jeremy, do you think maybe...

1130
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:16,093
Maybe it's
just a grain of sand.

1131
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:20,430
Go to 80.

1132
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:30,732
What about the bits of green?

1133
01:19:30,849 --> 01:19:32,767
Paint. For God's sake!

1134
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:33,517
Pistachio ice cream!

1135
01:19:33,518 --> 01:19:35,360
There's no basis to
assume it's anything yet.

1136
01:19:35,361 --> 01:19:38,574
You're too good a scientist not to
be thinking the same thing I am.

1137
01:19:38,649 --> 01:19:41,526
If this is
really something new,

1138
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:43,655
some brand-new form of life...

1139
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:46,286
The best hope of cracking it
is to be grindingly thorough

1140
01:19:46,287 --> 01:19:49,377
with the help of computer number one.

1141
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:51,795
Okay? Now let's get on with it.

1142
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:04,474
Hold it.

1143
01:20:06,093 --> 01:20:08,061
More pistachio?

1144
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:11,356
I count four patches.

1145
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:12,265
Keep going.

1146
01:20:12,266 --> 01:20:14,892
I'll computerize the coordinates.

1147
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:17,396
Let's take a look
at the rock at 100.

1148
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:27,080
I doubt that's what
knocked the capsule off trajectory.

1149
01:20:27,197 --> 01:20:29,495
Unless the rock was going
at tremendous speed,

1150
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:31,327
or unless it's terribly heavy.

1151
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:33,504
For Pete's sake, Ruth,
it can't be that heavy.

1152
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:35,625
Hall and I could lift the capsule.

1153
01:20:35,626 --> 01:20:37,873
However, it's possible the
rock is different in space:

1154
01:20:37,874 --> 01:20:39,172
Out there it might do anything.

1155
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:42,297
Maybe it has elastic properties
we don't even know yet.

1156
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:45,474
Let's have a look
at the green patches.

1157
01:20:45,591 --> 01:20:48,811
They must've come off the rock,

1158
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:50,854
if it is rock.

1159
01:20:53,891 --> 01:20:55,933
You know something?

1160
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:58,733
They do look like spatters of paint.

1161
01:20:59,938 --> 01:21:02,487
Let's go back to the rock
and see it at 440.

1162
01:21:11,909 --> 01:21:13,326
If that's a meteor,

1163
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:14,749
it's a damn peculiar one.

1164
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:19,379
This left border over here,

1165
01:21:20,918 --> 01:21:22,794
it's smooth, almost like

1166
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:24,638
an artificial surface.

1167
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:26,089
Painted, maybe.

1168
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:27,637
Luminous paint.

1169
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:29,550
If I keep watching it,

1170
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:31,144
I might think so.

1171
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:33,393
Wet paint sign and all.

1172
01:21:36,934 --> 01:21:38,476
Jeremy?

1173
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:40,024
What?

1174
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:44,658
Nothing.

1175
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:46,906
You okay?

1176
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:48,360
It's just my eyes are tired.

1177
01:21:48,361 --> 01:21:50,330
We've been at it five hours straight.

1178
01:21:50,447 --> 01:21:52,370
We'll take a caffeine
break in a minute.

1179
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:54,199
First I'd like to see one of the

1180
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:56,249
separate patches of green at 1,000.

1181
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:10,466
Did you see that?

1182
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:11,093
I saw it.

1183
01:22:11,218 --> 01:22:12,843
You didn't change the lighting?

1184
01:22:12,844 --> 01:22:13,937
I didn't touch it.

1185
01:22:16,974 --> 01:22:18,933
Looks alive.

1186
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:19,517
Yes.

1187
01:22:19,518 --> 01:22:21,484
It's bigger than two microns.

1188
01:22:21,485 --> 01:22:23,604
Which means the infection is spread

1189
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:25,653
by a mere fraction of the green.

1190
01:22:25,732 --> 01:22:27,567
I'm bringing down cameras.

1191
01:22:27,568 --> 01:22:29,491
Let's have the other micro-scanner.

1192
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,620
Stone to Level Control.

1193
01:22:36,621 --> 01:22:37,619
I need a Mic-T.

1194
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:38,871
Roger. Will send.

1195
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:43,713
Jump it up to 1500.

1196
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:45,965
Microscan doesn't go any higher.

1197
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:47,170
We can get 1500 light

1198
01:22:47,171 --> 01:22:49,048
magnification in micro-chemistry.

1199
01:22:49,131 --> 01:22:51,179
I'll send the rock through.

1200
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:56,554
Attention
C.L.T. S on levels 4 and 5.

1201
01:22:56,555 --> 01:22:58,931
Main computer shows capacity

1202
01:22:58,932 --> 01:23:00,980
versus access time

1203
01:23:01,059 --> 01:23:03,528
at ten to the twelfth bits.

1204
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:06,153
For any change in memory configuration,

1205
01:23:06,231 --> 01:23:09,781
C.L.T. S must check their unicorn op.

1206
01:23:58,325 --> 01:24:00,284
Beautiful, sir.

1207
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:00,909
I'm the Mic-T.

1208
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:02,379
You're real sharp on the hands.

1209
01:24:02,496 --> 01:24:05,090
Thanks. Nice to know one
hasn't lost one's touch.

1210
01:24:05,207 --> 01:24:06,297
The next step is to find out

1211
01:24:06,298 --> 01:24:07,087
what makes it grow.

1212
01:24:07,209 --> 01:24:08,459
We'll need samples from the scoop

1213
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:10,420
to send through maxcult
for culture and isolation.

1214
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:12,681
Roger, sir. In work.

1215
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:18,850
Good God!

1216
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:39,825
It's growing.

1217
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:57,680
Not so good.

1218
01:24:57,759 --> 01:24:59,179
Naturally he has acidosis.

1219
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:01,555
His blood pH was nine points off normal.

1220
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:03,431
But why? Stupid machine!

1221
01:25:03,432 --> 01:25:05,891
What makes his blood too acid?

1222
01:25:05,892 --> 01:25:08,145
Ask the patient.

1223
01:25:23,577 --> 01:25:27,207
Bio-safety to S.L., sectors 3 and 6.

1224
01:25:27,289 --> 01:25:29,667
Give us a code 3 when you get it.

1225
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:38,304
Mr. Jackson?

1226
01:25:42,846 --> 01:25:44,805
Now, don't be scared.

1227
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:46,228
I'm a doctor.

1228
01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:50,817
Bull.

1229
01:25:52,606 --> 01:25:54,324
Where am I?

1230
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:57,243
A special laboratory in Nevada.

1231
01:25:57,319 --> 01:25:59,617
We brought you here from Piedmont.

1232
01:25:59,618 --> 01:26:00,580
You're sick.

1233
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:05,001
It's this damn stomach of mine.

1234
01:26:05,118 --> 01:26:06,035
Bleeding?

1235
01:26:06,036 --> 01:26:08,380
Hell, yes, bleeding!

1236
01:26:08,455 --> 01:26:09,830
Bleeding in your stomach?

1237
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:10,957
You have an ulcer?

1238
01:26:10,958 --> 01:26:14,712
Damn tooting. Two years.

1239
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:16,086
But you must have pain.

1240
01:26:16,087 --> 01:26:17,385
What do you do for it?

1241
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:22,718
Aspirin...

1242
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:24,721
and squeeze.

1243
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:26,889
Squeeze? What's that?

1244
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:29,143
Ain't gonna tell you.

1245
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:48,671
So you're a Sterno drinker, huh?

1246
01:26:48,745 --> 01:26:50,668
Works good.

1247
01:26:56,378 --> 01:26:59,006
Give him squeeze.

1248
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:09,687
What's the baby's name, Mr. Jackson?

1249
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:12,643
You the nurse?

1250
01:27:12,644 --> 01:27:14,066
Uh-huh.

1251
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:18,195
Shoot!

1252
01:27:18,275 --> 01:27:20,198
Can't see your legs.

1253
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:26,541
Do you know the baby's name?

1254
01:27:27,993 --> 01:27:30,035
Give us a butt first.

1255
01:27:30,036 --> 01:27:32,038
Smoking isn't allowed here.

1256
01:27:33,623 --> 01:27:35,796
Then go fish.

1257
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:42,382
Yeah.

1258
01:27:42,383 --> 01:27:44,091
When you're finished,

1259
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:45,512
we'll transfuse Jackson

1260
01:27:45,513 --> 01:27:47,262
and start ice water lavage.

1261
01:27:47,345 --> 01:27:48,765
He has a two-year history

1262
01:27:48,766 --> 01:27:49,936
of bleeding ulcers.

1263
01:27:50,015 --> 01:27:51,185
You seem delighted.

1264
01:27:51,186 --> 01:27:53,402
It may be the reason he survived.

1265
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:57,906
If only our young gourmet
weren't so normal.

1266
01:27:57,907 --> 01:28:00,697
Well, let's hope
nothing changes that.

1267
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:02,990
We might have to
before this is over.

1268
01:28:39,397 --> 01:28:41,941
They should've dropped the bomb.

1269
01:28:41,942 --> 01:28:43,651
They should've dropped it

1270
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:45,325
two days ago, General.

1271
01:28:45,403 --> 01:28:47,153
This Phantom crashed a good 60 miles

1272
01:28:47,154 --> 01:28:48,498
beyond the cordoned area.

1273
01:28:48,615 --> 01:28:50,834
Men on the ground can't
cordon off airspace, sir.

1274
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:53,128
I just don't understand
why the Wildfire Team

1275
01:28:53,129 --> 01:28:56,293
hasn't beefed about
the delay in 7-12.

1276
01:28:56,414 --> 01:28:58,462
It's been almost 24 hours,
and not a word from them.

1277
01:28:58,542 --> 01:29:00,383
I don't think Piedmont had anything

1278
01:29:00,384 --> 01:29:02,129
to do with this crash, Manchek.

1279
01:29:02,212 --> 01:29:04,755
It was a fluke.

1280
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:07,305
That plane was only over the W.F. Area

1281
01:29:07,306 --> 01:29:09,552
for two minutes at 23,000 feet.

1282
01:29:09,553 --> 01:29:12,056
It's a routine training
mission accident, I bet you.

1283
01:29:12,057 --> 01:29:13,013
Pilot error.

1284
01:29:13,014 --> 01:29:13,890
Let's go.

1285
01:29:19,729 --> 01:29:21,902
Check with Wildfire
Message Center, Delta Five.

1286
01:29:21,982 --> 01:29:23,982
Make sure everything there is nominal.

1287
01:29:23,983 --> 01:29:27,156
Send me word on scrambler
at Big Head crash base.

1288
01:29:27,157 --> 01:29:27,657
Okay.

1289
01:29:34,077 --> 01:29:35,920
Checklim program completed.

1290
01:29:35,921 --> 01:29:37,835
All circuit banks nominal.

1291
01:29:47,465 --> 01:29:49,763
Same thing on the M.C.N. Console, Captain.

1292
01:29:51,761 --> 01:29:53,684
Just a minute, Dr. Robertson.

1293
01:29:53,763 --> 01:29:55,980
You're saying Stone's
$90 million facility,

1294
01:29:55,981 --> 01:29:57,191
which you recommended,

1295
01:29:57,192 --> 01:29:58,225
was knocked out

1296
01:29:58,226 --> 01:29:59,852
by a sliver of paper?

1297
01:29:59,853 --> 01:30:02,606
You tell that to the taxpayers!

1298
01:30:02,689 --> 01:30:04,440
These were highly-trained

1299
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:05,738
electronics men, Senator,

1300
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:07,911
looking for an electronic fault.

1301
01:30:07,986 --> 01:30:09,952
The trouble was purely mechanical

1302
01:30:09,953 --> 01:30:11,366
of the simplest kind.

1303
01:30:11,367 --> 01:30:13,364
But for them, it was like trying to see

1304
01:30:13,365 --> 01:30:15,164
an elephant through a microscope.

1305
01:30:15,285 --> 01:30:17,208
The sliver had peeled from the roll

1306
01:30:17,287 --> 01:30:18,912
and wedged between the bell and striker,

1307
01:30:18,913 --> 01:30:20,336
preventing the bell from ringing.

1308
01:30:28,006 --> 01:30:31,681
I'm convinced we're
being held incommunicado.

1309
01:30:31,801 --> 01:30:32,766
Very flattering.

1310
01:30:32,767 --> 01:30:35,810
We don't know much more
than when we got here.

1311
01:30:35,889 --> 01:30:37,812
We know about Scoop now.

1312
01:30:37,891 --> 01:30:41,310
It's possible what Scoop
found was no accident.

1313
01:30:41,311 --> 01:30:42,856
I suspect they were looking for

1314
01:30:42,857 --> 01:30:44,481
the ultimate biological weapon.

1315
01:30:44,606 --> 01:30:46,482
Sounds like you're getting

1316
01:30:46,483 --> 01:30:49,236
a little paranoid in this fun house.

1317
01:30:49,319 --> 01:30:51,070
What does Stone think

1318
01:30:51,071 --> 01:30:53,699
about the ultimate weapon, I mean?

1319
01:30:53,823 --> 01:30:56,542
We've isolated the organism.

1320
01:30:56,618 --> 01:30:58,871
It's in micro-chemistry.

1321
01:30:58,954 --> 01:30:59,796
We'll show you.

1322
01:30:59,797 --> 01:31:02,507
Watchdog
to electrical support...

1323
01:32:09,858 --> 01:32:11,610
All right, Lieutenant.

1324
01:32:11,693 --> 01:32:15,414
Albuquerque
Center, this is Air Force 561.

1325
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:16,447
Go ahead 561.

1326
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:18,200
My air hose is coming apart...

1327
01:32:18,283 --> 01:32:20,206
like it's dissolving!

1328
01:32:20,285 --> 01:32:23,004
Everything made of rubber
is coming apart!

1329
01:32:24,164 --> 01:32:25,916
I feel funny.

1330
01:32:29,794 --> 01:32:33,424
It's a fluke, a vibration effect maybe.

1331
01:32:33,506 --> 01:32:35,883
Let's get up there.

1332
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:37,054
Has Wildfire been informed?

1333
01:32:37,055 --> 01:32:38,224
You mean the germ people?

1334
01:32:38,303 --> 01:32:40,850
It went out to them on
the scrambler an hour ago.

1335
01:32:40,851 --> 01:32:42,099
This they can't ignore.

1336
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:10,544
I. B. Control
to cafeteria level 3.

1337
01:33:10,627 --> 01:33:12,721
Number 4 Charlie hatch
shows condition blue.

1338
01:33:12,837 --> 01:33:15,135
Alter responsivity characteristics

1339
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:17,304
until you get condition green.

1340
01:33:24,641 --> 01:33:26,564
Ready.

1341
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:36,485
Nothing so unusual

1342
01:33:36,486 --> 01:33:38,159
about our rock after all.

1343
01:33:38,238 --> 01:33:39,947
Hydrogen, carbon, oxygen,

1344
01:33:39,948 --> 01:33:41,916
sulfur, silicon, et cetera.

1345
01:33:41,991 --> 01:33:44,961
Except the black rock
isn't rock at all.

1346
01:33:45,036 --> 01:33:47,209
It's some kind of material
similar to plastic.

1347
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:49,040
How about that?

1348
01:33:49,165 --> 01:33:51,088
The green is even simpler.

1349
01:33:51,167 --> 01:33:54,091
Hydrogen, carbon,
nitrogen and oxygen.

1350
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:57,174
The four basic elements
of life on Earth, nothing else.

1351
01:33:57,257 --> 01:33:59,180
That's a relief.

1352
01:33:59,259 --> 01:34:00,258
I'd have been happier

1353
01:34:00,259 --> 01:34:02,103
if it'd turned out not to be alive.

1354
01:34:02,178 --> 01:34:03,637
Green stuff,

1355
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:06,141
you really had us going for a while.

1356
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:09,353
A. A. Analysis results
are ready, Dr. Dutton.

1357
01:34:12,939 --> 01:34:14,314
Something's wrong.

1358
01:34:14,315 --> 01:34:15,532
It's not registering.

1359
01:34:15,608 --> 01:34:17,406
Yes it is, sir.

1360
01:34:17,527 --> 01:34:21,452
It's just registering
double-zero, double-zero.

1361
01:34:21,531 --> 01:34:24,080
We'll switch to computerized analysis.

1362
01:34:30,456 --> 01:34:32,457
No amino acids!

1363
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:35,678
No proteins, no
enzymes, no nucleic acid.

1364
01:34:35,795 --> 01:34:39,299
Impossible! No organism
can maintain life without them!

1365
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:41,550
You mean, no Earth organism.

1366
01:34:41,551 --> 01:34:43,804
It must have evolved in
a totally different way.

1367
01:34:43,887 --> 01:34:45,137
You got it.

1368
01:34:45,138 --> 01:34:48,390
It doesn't come from here.

1369
01:34:48,391 --> 01:34:51,268
Without chemical reactions
there can't be life,

1370
01:34:51,269 --> 01:34:52,896
yet it grows, reproduces...

1371
01:34:52,897 --> 01:34:53,772
Wait!

1372
01:34:53,855 --> 01:34:55,196
The infection at Piedmont

1373
01:34:55,197 --> 01:34:56,863
has been stopped by the bomb.

1374
01:34:56,941 --> 01:34:58,065
We're secure at Wildfire.

1375
01:34:58,066 --> 01:35:00,490
We have everything we need
to achieve a breakthrough.

1376
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:06,042
All we have to do is attack this
problem like any other in science.

1377
01:35:06,117 --> 01:35:07,207
You could spend years

1378
01:35:07,208 --> 01:35:08,247
working on a thing like that

1379
01:35:08,248 --> 01:35:09,494
without solving its structure.

1380
01:35:09,495 --> 01:35:11,040
But when you do, there'll be

1381
01:35:11,041 --> 01:35:12,289
some red faces around.

1382
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:13,963
It could change everything.

1383
01:35:17,795 --> 01:35:19,638
Great.

1384
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:20,804
Ruth, since Kirke isn't here,

1385
01:35:20,805 --> 01:35:22,725
you take over the growth
program in microbiology.

1386
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,928
We're halfway home if we find out

1387
01:35:24,929 --> 01:35:27,221
what will keep that from growing.

1388
01:35:27,222 --> 01:35:29,816
Charlie, you work with
me on the E.M. Hall...

1389
01:35:29,817 --> 01:35:30,899
All right.

1390
01:35:30,975 --> 01:35:32,145
Let me get back to my patients.

1391
01:35:32,146 --> 01:35:34,020
I'm sure they were
protected by the same thing:

1392
01:35:34,103 --> 01:35:35,400
Some simple mechanism

1393
01:35:35,401 --> 01:35:37,237
I just don't recognize yet.

1394
01:35:37,238 --> 01:35:38,573
There's got to be something

1395
01:35:38,574 --> 01:35:40,785
that the old man and
baby have in common.

1396
01:35:40,902 --> 01:35:42,825
Oh, Hall?

1397
01:35:44,197 --> 01:35:45,322
Five minutes.

1398
01:35:45,323 --> 01:35:47,121
You told me before.

1399
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,950
Yes, we wouldn't want you to get

1400
01:35:48,951 --> 01:35:50,795
too far from the substation now.

1401
01:35:59,128 --> 01:36:02,928
Men, keep a
sharp eye open for pieces of rubber.

1402
01:36:03,007 --> 01:36:04,348
I'll repeat that for you.

1403
01:36:04,349 --> 01:36:06,765
Keep a sharp eye open
for pieces of rubber.

1404
01:36:10,932 --> 01:36:11,765
Major!

1405
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:14,064
Major Manchek!

1406
01:36:16,813 --> 01:36:19,236
Take a look at that, sir.

1407
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:22,775
We just found this, General.

1408
01:36:22,776 --> 01:36:23,949
It's a human bone.

1409
01:36:24,028 --> 01:36:26,702
Arm, I think.

1410
01:36:26,781 --> 01:36:28,122
It looks picked clean,

1411
01:36:28,123 --> 01:36:29,959
almost like it was polished.

1412
01:36:30,034 --> 01:36:31,034
That's right.

1413
01:36:31,035 --> 01:36:32,787
Well, I don't get it.

1414
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:34,211
There is no actual rubber

1415
01:36:34,212 --> 01:36:35,832
on the Phantom F-4, General.

1416
01:36:35,833 --> 01:36:38,250
It's all a synthetic plastic

1417
01:36:38,251 --> 01:36:40,595
compound called polycron.

1418
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:42,843
It has some of the characteristics

1419
01:36:42,844 --> 01:36:43,886
of human skin.

1420
01:36:43,965 --> 01:36:45,888
What the hell is that?

1421
01:36:45,967 --> 01:36:48,093
What's left of his oxygen mask.

1422
01:36:48,094 --> 01:36:49,803
It's made of polycron.

1423
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:51,896
I'd say it was done
by a chemical reaction

1424
01:36:51,897 --> 01:36:52,560
of some sort.

1425
01:36:52,682 --> 01:36:54,355
Or maybe a microorganism.

1426
01:36:54,356 --> 01:36:55,021
Meaning?

1427
01:36:55,101 --> 01:36:56,476
Meaning there was something

1428
01:36:56,477 --> 01:36:58,445
in that plane that consumes plastic.

1429
01:37:30,178 --> 01:37:32,220
How's Maxcult coming, Ruth?

1430
01:37:32,221 --> 01:37:35,393
Will you be finished by
the midnight conference?

1431
01:37:35,394 --> 01:37:35,766
Easy.

1432
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:38,899
Good. You can give us
the results then.

1433
01:38:42,458 --> 01:38:45,758
Feeling better, aren't you, Mr. Jackson?

1434
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:47,801
Yep!

1435
01:38:50,049 --> 01:38:52,768
Do you always have
to wear that iron suit?

1436
01:38:52,885 --> 01:38:54,886
Yep!

1437
01:38:54,887 --> 01:38:57,354
Maybe you'll tell us
the baby's name now,

1438
01:38:57,355 --> 01:38:58,099
Mr. Jackson.

1439
01:38:58,182 --> 01:39:02,394
Manuel Rios. Mex.

1440
01:39:02,395 --> 01:39:04,614
Real little heller.

1441
01:39:04,689 --> 01:39:07,192
Squalls morning, noon and night.

1442
01:39:07,275 --> 01:39:08,900
Neighbors wouldn't let them

1443
01:39:08,901 --> 01:39:10,403
keep their windows open.

1444
01:39:12,697 --> 01:39:15,291
Do you sleep with your window closed?

1445
01:39:15,366 --> 01:39:18,040
No sirree, Bob.

1446
01:39:18,119 --> 01:39:20,087
Fresh air fiend.

1447
01:39:23,332 --> 01:39:27,085
Tell us what happened, Mr. Jackson.

1448
01:39:27,086 --> 01:39:29,635
I don't want to think about it.

1449
01:39:31,883 --> 01:39:34,352
You know what people will say?

1450
01:39:34,427 --> 01:39:35,677
Piedmont was bad.

1451
01:39:35,678 --> 01:39:37,772
That's why it was punished.

1452
01:39:37,847 --> 01:39:40,432
First the town went crazy

1453
01:39:40,433 --> 01:39:42,982
and then was destroyed.

1454
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:44,983
You're crazy!

1455
01:39:45,062 --> 01:39:47,314
Folks at Piedmont was good,

1456
01:39:47,315 --> 01:39:49,238
decent, normal folks.

1457
01:39:49,358 --> 01:39:50,653
The man we found dressed up

1458
01:39:50,654 --> 01:39:51,992
in his dough-boy’s uniform,

1459
01:39:51,993 --> 01:39:52,953
call that normal?

1460
01:39:53,070 --> 01:39:56,490
Pete Arnold, who worked at the store.

1461
01:39:56,491 --> 01:39:57,866
It was the disease.

1462
01:39:57,867 --> 01:39:59,164
How do you know?

1463
01:39:59,285 --> 01:40:01,126
'Cause the only thing wrong with him

1464
01:40:01,127 --> 01:40:02,667
before that night was sugar.

1465
01:40:02,788 --> 01:40:05,007
Diabetes? Did he take insulin?

1466
01:40:05,082 --> 01:40:07,505
A couple of times a day.

1467
01:40:07,585 --> 01:40:09,883
Hated the needle.

1468
01:40:09,962 --> 01:40:12,511
I tried to talk him
into using squeeze.

1469
01:40:12,590 --> 01:40:15,218
Insulin. If he missed his
treatment, he'd go...

1470
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:22,433
Thanks, Mr. Jackson.

1471
01:41:05,142 --> 01:41:07,270
Oh, my God!

1472
01:41:16,737 --> 01:41:18,113
Central C.C.

1473
01:41:18,114 --> 01:41:20,162
To big P.C. Control, all levels.

1474
01:41:20,283 --> 01:41:22,377
Testing laser system.

1475
01:41:22,451 --> 01:41:24,954
Please maintain random fringe drift

1476
01:41:25,037 --> 01:41:28,211
within ten percent of initial value.

1477
01:41:37,883 --> 01:41:40,509
Dr. Leavitt, you have
a midnight conference.

1478
01:41:40,510 --> 01:41:42,184
The signal has struck twice.

1479
01:41:42,263 --> 01:41:44,482
I heard!

1480
01:41:44,557 --> 01:41:46,980
I heard! I've been busy.

1481
01:41:55,985 --> 01:41:57,485
The important thing is

1482
01:41:57,486 --> 01:41:59,487
something can slow it down.

1483
01:41:59,488 --> 01:42:01,957
I think it's some kind
of blood disorder.

1484
01:42:02,074 --> 01:42:04,370
If the old soldier missed
his insulin treatment,

1485
01:42:04,371 --> 01:42:05,494
he'd go into acidosis.

1486
01:42:05,495 --> 01:42:08,168
The same as Jackson on Sterno.

1487
01:42:08,289 --> 01:42:11,006
I'll bet Leavitt finds the
organism shows no growth

1488
01:42:11,007 --> 01:42:12,673
on some of the blood cultures.

1489
01:42:12,674 --> 01:42:15,712
What's wrong
with the baby's blood?

1490
01:42:15,713 --> 01:42:17,213
Nothing... so far.

1491
01:42:17,214 --> 01:42:20,091
Then you're back where you started.

1492
01:42:20,092 --> 01:42:22,891
No. Somehow they're all interrelated.

1493
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:24,938
I'll have the answer when I know

1494
01:42:24,939 --> 01:42:27,432
why a 69-year-old Sterno drinker

1495
01:42:27,433 --> 01:42:29,684
with an ulcer is like a normal

1496
01:42:29,685 --> 01:42:31,278
six-month-old baby.

1497
01:42:32,897 --> 01:42:34,738
Did you get any no-growth readouts...

1498
01:42:34,739 --> 01:42:36,234
No, but I'm not finished yet.

1499
01:42:36,317 --> 01:42:37,988
You told me you'd be finished.

1500
01:42:37,989 --> 01:42:39,987
I decided to play part of it back.

1501
01:42:40,112 --> 01:42:42,488
What for? The first
time around should be...

1502
01:42:42,489 --> 01:42:43,537
Knock it off, Hall!

1503
01:42:43,616 --> 01:42:45,869
Wait. Wait.

1504
01:42:47,203 --> 01:42:49,797
We're all tired.

1505
01:42:49,914 --> 01:42:51,757
Tired people make mistakes.

1506
01:42:51,832 --> 01:42:53,630
They draw wrong conclusions,

1507
01:42:53,631 --> 01:42:54,878
they drop things.

1508
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:57,337
That mustn't happen.

1509
01:42:57,338 --> 01:42:59,259
Starting now, I want the team to get

1510
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:01,054
six hours sleep out of every 24.

1511
01:43:01,133 --> 01:43:03,056
Suits me.

1512
01:43:05,054 --> 01:43:06,053
Before turning in,

1513
01:43:06,054 --> 01:43:08,057
shouldn't we file for a code name?

1514
01:43:08,182 --> 01:43:10,480
Yeah, good idea.

1515
01:43:11,977 --> 01:43:14,354
Nine over 4 over 8

1516
01:43:14,355 --> 01:43:17,359
under 167.29.

1517
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:21,537
Auto check in grade.

1518
01:43:57,481 --> 01:43:58,355
Why Andromeda?

1519
01:43:58,356 --> 01:43:59,574
Andromeda's our...

1520
01:43:59,692 --> 01:44:01,615
Stone!

1521
01:44:03,863 --> 01:44:06,412
"Directive 7-12 has not been acted upon.

1522
01:44:06,532 --> 01:44:10,285
Alternative directive 7-11 now in effect."

1523
01:44:10,286 --> 01:44:11,536
They didn't drop the bomb!

1524
01:44:11,537 --> 01:44:13,756
It's an M.C.N. Transmission sent yesterday.

1525
01:44:13,831 --> 01:44:15,424
Idiots!

1526
01:44:20,838 --> 01:44:22,806
Put me through to Dr. Robertson.

1527
01:44:22,882 --> 01:44:23,965
In work, sir.

1528
01:44:23,966 --> 01:44:25,466
Burke, you didn't special alert

1529
01:44:25,467 --> 01:44:26,720
an M.C.N. Message to us.

1530
01:44:26,844 --> 01:44:28,389
There haven't been any, sir.

1531
01:44:28,390 --> 01:44:29,855
The bell didn't ring...

1532
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:31,054
Don't argue, damn it!

1533
01:44:31,055 --> 01:44:32,433
I've got one in my hand.

1534
01:44:34,518 --> 01:44:37,567
Well, well. About time
we heard from you.

1535
01:44:37,646 --> 01:44:39,066
There has been a communications foul-up.

1536
01:44:39,067 --> 01:44:39,781
Never mind that now.

1537
01:44:39,857 --> 01:44:41,825
Why hasn't that bomb
been dropped on Piedmont?

1538
01:44:41,901 --> 01:44:43,993
The decision on 7-12 isn't final.

1539
01:44:43,994 --> 01:44:46,080
It was just postponed 48 hours.

1540
01:44:46,155 --> 01:44:47,655
By then the disease could spread

1541
01:44:47,656 --> 01:44:48,953
into a worldwide epidemic.

1542
01:44:49,033 --> 01:44:50,954
It's because of rash
statements like that

1543
01:44:50,955 --> 01:44:52,794
the president doesn't trust scientists.

1544
01:44:52,912 --> 01:44:55,040
Warn the president
it may already be too late.

1545
01:44:55,122 --> 01:44:56,212
Stay on his back, Robbie.

1546
01:44:56,213 --> 01:44:57,834
You've got to make him call a 7-12.

1547
01:44:57,917 --> 01:45:00,295
Can you get me another
appointment tonight, Grimes?

1548
01:45:00,377 --> 01:45:03,256
Now let's all just keep
our heads screwed on.

1549
01:45:03,257 --> 01:45:06,680
Any thoughts about
the Phantom crash?

1550
01:45:06,759 --> 01:45:09,683
We sent you a couple messages on it.

1551
01:45:09,762 --> 01:45:12,982
A Phantom jet strayed over the
cordoned area around Piedmont.

1552
01:45:13,098 --> 01:45:14,224
Any other information?

1553
01:45:14,225 --> 01:45:15,600
Well, the pilot said...

1554
01:45:15,601 --> 01:45:18,650
that all the rubber on
the plane was dissolving.

1555
01:45:18,729 --> 01:45:20,697
His last communication was pretty weird.

1556
01:45:20,773 --> 01:45:21,693
Like he was crazy?

1557
01:45:21,694 --> 01:45:23,736
He was mighty confused, that's for sure.

1558
01:45:23,737 --> 01:45:25,951
Robbie, it's your job
to get the president

1559
01:45:25,952 --> 01:45:27,616
to activate a 7-12 immediately.

1560
01:45:27,617 --> 01:45:28,908
If he doesn't, there's no guarantee

1561
01:45:28,909 --> 01:45:29,871
anyone west of Piedmont

1562
01:45:29,872 --> 01:45:31,032
will be alive in the morning.

1563
01:45:31,033 --> 01:45:32,580
Simmer down, Professor.

1564
01:45:32,581 --> 01:45:33,998
I'll wake the boss.

1565
01:45:34,078 --> 01:45:36,456
But General Sparks says
the crash was just a fluke.

1566
01:45:36,539 --> 01:45:37,789
Forget the crash, Robbie.

1567
01:45:37,790 --> 01:45:39,792
Stay on that 7-12 and get back to me.

1568
01:45:39,917 --> 01:45:41,840
We'll be working around the clock.

1569
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:17,161
That's a good slice.

1570
01:46:17,162 --> 01:46:18,379
It's too thick.

1571
01:46:23,544 --> 01:46:25,672
I'm setting it at 800 angstroms,

1572
01:46:25,754 --> 01:46:29,429
and I'm going to a higher magnification.

1573
01:46:31,093 --> 01:46:33,052
Now we're getting somewhere!

1574
01:46:33,053 --> 01:46:33,636
Yeah.

1575
01:46:33,637 --> 01:46:34,852
But these can't be more

1576
01:46:34,853 --> 01:46:36,520
than a few molecules in depth.

1577
01:46:40,269 --> 01:46:42,692
That's the one, that silver one.

1578
01:46:47,443 --> 01:46:49,866
This is a Villabach alert,
all levels.

1579
01:46:49,945 --> 01:46:51,868
This is a Villabach alert.

1580
01:46:51,947 --> 01:46:55,872
Electromagnetic waves are not
registering on the D.l.R.

1581
01:47:10,799 --> 01:47:12,674
Sample in the button
and sealed, Charlie.

1582
01:47:12,675 --> 01:47:13,677
Start the vacuum pump.

1583
01:47:23,020 --> 01:47:25,239
Stone, can I see you?

1584
01:47:25,314 --> 01:47:27,282
I have the results
of the growth cultures.

1585
01:47:27,399 --> 01:47:28,694
No, we can't leave now.

1586
01:47:28,695 --> 01:47:30,945
We have an Andromeda cell in the E.M.

1587
01:47:31,028 --> 01:47:33,998
Okay, Charlie, let's
put it on the screen.

1588
01:47:42,915 --> 01:47:44,631
Let's run it through the computer

1589
01:47:44,632 --> 01:47:45,922
for contrast expansion.

1590
01:47:54,927 --> 01:47:55,510
Stone?

1591
01:47:55,511 --> 01:47:57,479
What do you think?

1592
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:02,063
It looks like a crystal.

1593
01:48:02,142 --> 01:48:04,852
Well, gentlemen, there's our answer.

1594
01:48:04,853 --> 01:48:05,604
To what?

1595
01:48:05,729 --> 01:48:08,448
How Andromeda functions
without amino acids.

1596
01:48:08,524 --> 01:48:10,149
Crystalline structure.

1597
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:10,650
Yes.

1598
01:48:10,651 --> 01:48:13,120
I've often thought
that living matter

1599
01:48:13,237 --> 01:48:15,740
might be based on
crystals of some kind.

1600
01:48:15,823 --> 01:48:17,996
All these wedge-shaped compartments,

1601
01:48:18,075 --> 01:48:19,541
they'd serve to separate

1602
01:48:19,542 --> 01:48:21,629
biochemical functions very well.

1603
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:26,542
It's dividing.

1604
01:48:29,253 --> 01:48:31,506
In a vacuum, bombarded by electrons?

1605
01:48:31,507 --> 01:48:33,348
It shouldn't even be alive!

1606
01:48:33,465 --> 01:48:34,840
That's what I wanted to tell you.

1607
01:48:34,841 --> 01:48:36,217
The growth program shows

1608
01:48:36,218 --> 01:48:38,095
Andromeda can live on anything.

1609
01:48:38,178 --> 01:48:40,476
Only gas and light affect it.

1610
01:48:40,556 --> 01:48:43,353
You didn't get any no-growth
results on the cultures?

1611
01:48:43,354 --> 01:48:43,976
None. Look.

1612
01:48:48,564 --> 01:48:51,192
The poorest growth
occurs in pure oxygen

1613
01:48:51,275 --> 01:48:53,869
incubated under infrared light.

1614
01:48:53,986 --> 01:48:56,705
Andromeda grows best in
carbon dioxide and hydrogen

1615
01:48:56,780 --> 01:48:58,703
incubated under X rays.

1616
01:48:58,782 --> 01:49:00,580
No excretions.

1617
01:49:00,659 --> 01:49:02,326
No waste of any kind.

1618
01:49:02,327 --> 01:49:03,874
You'd expect that.

1619
01:49:03,996 --> 01:49:07,000
Andromeda's perfect
for existence in outer space.

1620
01:49:07,082 --> 01:49:10,052
Consumes everything, wastes nothing.

1621
01:49:13,881 --> 01:49:15,256
Good Lord. Stone to Delta Five.

1622
01:49:15,257 --> 01:49:17,180
Put me through to Robertson immediately.

1623
01:49:17,301 --> 01:49:17,549
What?

1624
01:49:17,550 --> 01:49:19,224
God, I hope we're not too late.

1625
01:49:19,303 --> 01:49:19,886
Tell me.

1626
01:49:19,887 --> 01:49:22,390
It functions like an atomic reactor.

1627
01:49:22,514 --> 01:49:23,638
An atomic blast could provide it

1628
01:49:23,639 --> 01:49:25,015
with enough energy to grow

1629
01:49:25,016 --> 01:49:26,517
into a gigantic super-colony.

1630
01:49:26,518 --> 01:49:27,235
In one day.

1631
01:49:29,521 --> 01:49:31,522
You can relax now.

1632
01:49:31,523 --> 01:49:33,114
We've just left the president.

1633
01:49:33,115 --> 01:49:34,655
He agreed to drop the bomb.

1634
01:49:34,735 --> 01:49:36,735
No, you've got to stop 7-12
from being carried out.

1635
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:37,944
Now, wait a minute!

1636
01:49:37,945 --> 01:49:39,742
We're not playing Ping-Pong.

1637
01:49:39,743 --> 01:49:41,911
We just got through
telling the president...

1638
01:49:41,912 --> 01:49:43,081
For God's sake, go back!

1639
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:46,002
It grows when exposed to X rays
or any source of energy.

1640
01:49:46,003 --> 01:49:47,416
Tell him no nuclear device

1641
01:49:47,417 --> 01:49:49,460
must be detonated anywhere near it.

1642
01:49:49,461 --> 01:49:50,924
We just found out Andromeda works

1643
01:49:50,925 --> 01:49:51,965
like a little reactor:

1644
01:49:52,044 --> 01:49:53,762
Converts matter to energy,

1645
01:49:53,763 --> 01:49:55,597
energy to matter directly.

1646
01:49:55,672 --> 01:49:57,468
Then the bomb would only provide

1647
01:49:57,469 --> 01:49:59,512
a fantastically rich growth medium.

1648
01:49:59,513 --> 01:50:00,261
Understand?

1649
01:50:00,344 --> 01:50:03,018
No, but I'll pass along
the recommendation.

1650
01:50:03,514 --> 01:50:05,059
The boss will be pleased to know

1651
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:06,432
that he made the right decision

1652
01:50:06,433 --> 01:50:07,685
on 7-12 in the first place.

1653
01:50:07,768 --> 01:50:10,112
Congratulate him
on his scientific insight.

1654
01:50:11,063 --> 01:50:13,031
And, Robbie?

1655
01:50:13,148 --> 01:50:15,194
You'd better get the
atomic self-destruct in here

1656
01:50:15,195 --> 01:50:16,409
disarmed as soon as possible.

1657
01:50:16,485 --> 01:50:19,284
Right. I'll start on the clearances now.

1658
01:50:19,363 --> 01:50:21,866
It'll be done by morning.

1659
01:50:23,951 --> 01:50:24,541
No, no, no.

1660
01:50:24,542 --> 01:50:27,038
That won't work until
the damn thing's going.

1661
01:50:52,521 --> 01:50:55,240
All the molecules
appear to be the same.

1662
01:50:55,315 --> 01:50:56,023
Yes.

1663
01:50:56,024 --> 01:50:58,743
Andromeda isn't composed
of different substances

1664
01:50:58,819 --> 01:51:00,742
like a normal cell.

1665
01:51:00,821 --> 01:51:02,994
All the subunits are the same.

1666
01:51:03,073 --> 01:51:05,408
Damndest thing I've ever s...

1667
01:51:05,409 --> 01:51:07,457
Boy, a single substance.

1668
01:51:07,536 --> 01:51:09,959
Then how the
hell does it operate?

1669
01:51:10,038 --> 01:51:11,629
How does anything so simple

1670
01:51:11,630 --> 01:51:13,250
utilize energy for growth?

1671
01:51:13,333 --> 01:51:15,425
No way of telling
from that structure.

1672
01:51:15,426 --> 01:51:16,341
Yes, there is.

1673
01:51:16,342 --> 01:51:17,713
With this new data,

1674
01:51:17,838 --> 01:51:19,713
we can get a computerized version

1675
01:51:19,714 --> 01:51:21,388
of how Andromeda functions.

1676
01:51:29,349 --> 01:51:31,058
They're not uniform.

1677
01:51:31,059 --> 01:51:32,857
Could be mutations.

1678
01:51:46,283 --> 01:51:47,909
What the devil?

1679
01:51:47,910 --> 01:51:48,877
601?

1680
01:51:48,952 --> 01:51:50,828
The computer's overloaded!

1681
01:51:50,829 --> 01:51:53,378
Too much data coming in too fast.

1682
01:51:53,457 --> 01:51:56,381
Dividing and mutating
at the same time?

1683
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:58,554
And nothing to stop it.

1684
01:51:58,670 --> 01:52:01,219
Normal Earth checks and
balances don't exist for it.

1685
01:52:01,298 --> 01:52:03,344
We'd better get a bio-math mapping

1686
01:52:03,345 --> 01:52:05,891
of its new growth potential and spread.

1687
01:52:16,104 --> 01:52:19,324
According to this,
there'll be a super-colony

1688
01:52:19,399 --> 01:52:21,493
of Andromeda over the
entire Southwest...

1689
01:52:21,610 --> 01:52:25,831
Jeremy, these are
biological warfare maps.

1690
01:52:27,950 --> 01:52:30,785
Why, yes, so they are.

1691
01:52:30,786 --> 01:52:34,381
Oh, but simulations, Charlie.

1692
01:52:34,498 --> 01:52:37,752
Defensive. It's just a scenario.

1693
01:52:37,834 --> 01:52:39,377
That's not the point,

1694
01:52:39,378 --> 01:52:40,630
for God's sake!

1695
01:52:40,712 --> 01:52:43,261
Wildfire was built
for germ warfare!

1696
01:52:43,340 --> 01:52:44,715
Wildfire and Scoop.

1697
01:52:44,716 --> 01:52:46,259
And you knew, Stone.

1698
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:47,352
You knew it!

1699
01:52:47,427 --> 01:52:48,301
That's not true, Ruth.

1700
01:52:48,302 --> 01:52:50,180
I learned about Scoop
the same time you did.

1701
01:52:50,264 --> 01:52:53,015
They already have
Andromeda programmed.

1702
01:52:53,016 --> 01:52:54,391
The purpose of Scoop was to find

1703
01:52:54,392 --> 01:52:56,111
new biological weapons in outer space,

1704
01:52:56,228 --> 01:52:58,401
and then use Wildfire to develop them.

1705
01:52:58,402 --> 01:52:59,105
It stinks!

1706
01:52:59,106 --> 01:53:00,653
You're blowing your tops.

1707
01:53:00,654 --> 01:53:01,857
We have no proof.

1708
01:53:01,858 --> 01:53:02,322
The map!

1709
01:53:02,323 --> 01:53:03,318
Don't be an ass!

1710
01:53:03,443 --> 01:53:04,818
That map only shows what Andromeda

1711
01:53:04,819 --> 01:53:06,322
could do in the hands of an enemy.

1712
01:53:06,446 --> 01:53:09,165
Enemy? We did it to ourselves.

1713
01:53:09,241 --> 01:53:11,241
Perhaps, but this is hardly the time

1714
01:53:11,242 --> 01:53:12,620
to organize a protest.

1715
01:53:12,621 --> 01:53:15,623
Another giant leap for mankind!

1716
01:53:15,747 --> 01:53:17,715
I wish I could believe you.

1717
01:53:17,791 --> 01:53:18,631
Whether you do or not,

1718
01:53:18,632 --> 01:53:19,749
the only important thing now

1719
01:53:19,750 --> 01:53:20,843
is to find the antidote.

1720
01:53:20,844 --> 01:53:23,379
Let's get on with it, Charlie.

1721
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:25,423
Test the cultured organisms

1722
01:53:25,424 --> 01:53:27,176
for biologic potency.

1723
01:53:27,259 --> 01:53:28,383
All right, I'll run them

1724
01:53:28,384 --> 01:53:29,637
against a rat in autopsy.

1725
01:53:29,761 --> 01:53:32,430
I want to seal up the capsule.

1726
01:53:32,431 --> 01:53:33,472
Watch it.

1727
01:53:33,473 --> 01:53:34,768
Andromeda's altered.

1728
01:53:34,769 --> 01:53:37,485
Its effect might be radically different.

1729
01:53:37,561 --> 01:53:39,814
I'll try to get us a photo
of the mutated form.

1730
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:55,083
Photo lab to red map.

1731
01:53:55,162 --> 01:54:00,384
The offbeat access reference
reads at 649-F, 1.500.

1732
01:54:02,085 --> 01:54:04,008
Please copy.

1733
01:54:15,807 --> 01:54:18,399
This may be the key
to beating Andromeda.

1734
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:19,517
How, by starving him to death?

1735
01:54:19,518 --> 01:54:21,119
No, but don't feed him until I tell you.

1736
01:54:25,817 --> 01:54:28,240
Contamination!

1737
01:54:34,201 --> 01:54:38,923
A seal has broken in autopsy.

1738
01:54:38,997 --> 01:54:41,341
Emergency procedures are in effect.

1739
01:54:41,416 --> 01:54:42,666
What's the matter?

1740
01:54:42,667 --> 01:54:44,669
Infection spread. Autopsy.

1741
01:54:54,262 --> 01:54:54,806
Is he alive?

1742
01:54:54,807 --> 01:54:56,603
I should've been with him! Dr. Dutton!

1743
01:54:56,681 --> 01:54:58,604
It's no use. It's sealed off.

1744
01:54:59,768 --> 01:55:02,021
Dr. Hall!

1745
01:55:04,731 --> 01:55:06,649
She's in trouble.

1746
01:55:06,650 --> 01:55:08,618
Ruth, are you...

1747
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:29,636
She's got the germ!

1748
01:55:36,346 --> 01:55:38,347
Someone bring 100 milligrams

1749
01:55:38,348 --> 01:55:40,692
of phenobarb in a syringe fast!

1750
01:55:43,687 --> 01:55:44,811
There's no danger.

1751
01:55:44,812 --> 01:55:46,235
She isn't contagious.

1752
01:55:48,066 --> 01:55:51,616
There's no danger!

1753
01:55:51,695 --> 01:55:55,495
...to L-5,
P. I. E. And E. T. E.

1754
01:55:55,615 --> 01:55:58,414
Your second quarter rest
period has been canceled.

1755
01:55:58,535 --> 01:56:01,163
Time R.A. Has been reassigned

1756
01:56:01,246 --> 01:56:03,624
according to crash program.

1757
01:56:04,833 --> 01:56:06,756
Come on!

1758
01:56:06,835 --> 01:56:08,257
Come on. She can't hurt you.

1759
01:56:08,336 --> 01:56:10,555
Wasn't she with Dr. Dutton?

1760
01:56:10,630 --> 01:56:11,595
No, it's epilepsy.

1761
01:56:11,596 --> 01:56:12,885
Give her the injection.

1762
01:56:12,886 --> 01:56:14,100
She'll be all right.

1763
01:56:15,677 --> 01:56:18,055
Good girl. Thanks.

1764
01:56:21,141 --> 01:56:22,141
I'm scared.

1765
01:56:22,142 --> 01:56:24,268
Oh, Lord, I'm scared.

1766
01:56:24,269 --> 01:56:25,143
You'll be okay, Charlie.

1767
01:56:25,144 --> 01:56:26,988
We're pumping pure oxygen
through your lab now.

1768
01:56:27,063 --> 01:56:29,316
We know Andromeda
doesn't do well in oxygen.

1769
01:56:31,401 --> 01:56:32,025
He's alive!

1770
01:56:32,026 --> 01:56:33,324
Where have you been?

1771
01:56:33,445 --> 01:56:36,405
Leavitt had a seizure.

1772
01:56:36,406 --> 01:56:37,373
What?

1773
01:56:37,449 --> 01:56:38,664
Epilepsy. The red light

1774
01:56:38,665 --> 01:56:39,953
flashing at 3 per second

1775
01:56:39,954 --> 01:56:40,952
brought on a fit.

1776
01:56:41,077 --> 01:56:43,000
Why in the hell didn't
she tell us about it?

1777
01:56:43,079 --> 01:56:45,045
No top lab would have her if they knew.

1778
01:56:45,046 --> 01:56:47,008
Insurance, prejudice, all that crap.

1779
01:56:47,083 --> 01:56:49,006
From the Middle Ages.

1780
01:56:49,085 --> 01:56:52,009
Amazing he's still alive.

1781
01:56:52,088 --> 01:56:54,090
Well, it's been three minutes.

1782
01:56:54,174 --> 01:56:55,471
He's on pure oxygen.

1783
01:56:55,472 --> 01:56:58,260
I don't know how long that can hold him.

1784
01:56:58,261 --> 01:57:01,060
We're, working on some ideas, Charlie.

1785
01:57:01,181 --> 01:57:04,401
Ask your germ warfare friends.

1786
01:57:04,476 --> 01:57:06,399
They have lots.

1787
01:57:06,478 --> 01:57:08,572
Try to stay calm.

1788
01:57:08,688 --> 01:57:10,611
What happened?

1789
01:57:10,690 --> 01:57:12,909
Seal must've broken in there.

1790
01:57:12,984 --> 01:57:15,407
They had the same thing at the lunar lab.

1791
01:57:15,487 --> 01:57:17,785
That's why we use polycron gaskets here.

1792
01:57:17,906 --> 01:57:20,329
At least the rest of Wildfire is secure.

1793
01:57:22,786 --> 01:57:24,709
Poor devil.

1794
01:57:24,788 --> 01:57:26,711
Look at the way he's breathing.

1795
01:57:26,712 --> 01:57:28,629
He's scared to death.

1796
01:57:28,708 --> 01:57:30,793
That oxygen should relax him,

1797
01:57:30,794 --> 01:57:32,671
slow down his breathing.

1798
01:57:32,754 --> 01:57:34,722
No, we want him to breathe fast!

1799
01:57:34,798 --> 01:57:36,764
In Piedmont, Jackson
was crocked on Sterno.

1800
01:57:36,765 --> 01:57:37,509
Sterno acidosis.

1801
01:57:37,592 --> 01:57:39,060
Acidosis: Rapid breathing.

1802
01:57:39,135 --> 01:57:40,261
What the hell you doing?

1803
01:57:40,262 --> 01:57:42,230
Turn off the oxygen.
Put him on room air.

1804
01:57:42,305 --> 01:57:43,179
The baby, he's normal.

1805
01:57:43,180 --> 01:57:43,975
Cries all the time.

1806
01:57:43,976 --> 01:57:45,064
Can't catch his breath.

1807
01:57:45,065 --> 01:57:45,682
Rapid breathing?

1808
01:57:45,683 --> 01:57:46,899
It just can't be that simple.

1809
01:57:46,900 --> 01:57:47,400
It isn't.

1810
01:57:47,435 --> 01:57:50,646
Dutton, I think rapid breathing helps.

1811
01:57:50,647 --> 01:57:52,647
Don't let the bug in
your lungs long enough

1812
01:57:52,648 --> 01:57:53,901
to penetrate blood vessels.

1813
01:57:54,025 --> 01:57:55,775
I want to turn off the pure oxygen,

1814
01:57:55,776 --> 01:57:58,496
then you start breathing
room air as fast as you can.

1815
01:57:58,572 --> 01:57:59,154
No! No.

1816
01:57:59,155 --> 01:58:01,829
I was running a test in here.

1817
01:58:01,950 --> 01:58:03,575
The air is thick with Andromeda.

1818
01:58:03,576 --> 01:58:05,705
Experiment with your own life, damn it!

1819
01:58:05,787 --> 01:58:06,581
We won't do it, Charlie.

1820
01:58:06,582 --> 01:58:07,044
Take it easy.

1821
01:58:07,045 --> 01:58:07,726
I know I'm close.

1822
01:58:07,831 --> 01:58:09,376
I'm sure it has something to do

1823
01:58:09,377 --> 01:58:11,170
with blood chemistry and breathing.

1824
01:58:11,171 --> 01:58:13,588
Dr. Hall. May I please
feed the baby now?

1825
01:58:13,589 --> 01:58:15,337
He's been crying steadily...

1826
01:58:15,338 --> 01:58:17,716
That's what I want. Keep him crying.

1827
01:58:17,799 --> 01:58:19,174
Run another blood value on him.

1828
01:58:19,175 --> 01:58:20,347
Get his pH measurements.

1829
01:58:20,427 --> 01:58:22,145
Yes, Doctor!

1830
01:58:23,638 --> 01:58:24,762
With all the yelling,

1831
01:58:24,763 --> 01:58:26,264
blowing off carbon dioxide,

1832
01:58:26,265 --> 01:58:28,360
the kid should have too little acid.

1833
01:58:28,435 --> 01:58:30,185
Alkaline: A blood condition just

1834
01:58:30,186 --> 01:58:31,857
the opposite from the old man.

1835
01:58:31,858 --> 01:58:32,947
Too much alkali.

1836
01:58:32,948 --> 01:58:35,738
Well, what good does that do Dutton?

1837
01:58:35,859 --> 01:58:37,827
Karen, where's the blood test?

1838
01:58:37,902 --> 01:58:41,905
It's coming through now on your console.

1839
01:58:41,906 --> 01:58:44,284
Hell of a way to run a hospital.

1840
01:58:47,412 --> 01:58:49,413
Just what you expected.

1841
01:58:49,414 --> 01:58:50,538
Opposite blood chemistries,

1842
01:58:50,539 --> 01:58:51,666
the baby and the old man.

1843
01:58:51,791 --> 01:58:53,962
One of them should
be a dead opposite...

1844
01:58:53,963 --> 01:58:54,711
But he's not.

1845
01:58:54,794 --> 01:58:57,013
There must be a connection!

1846
01:58:58,465 --> 01:59:00,056
They both stayed alive at Piedmont

1847
01:59:00,057 --> 01:59:01,176
breathing the same air.

1848
01:59:01,301 --> 01:59:03,010
One's blood too alkaline,

1849
01:59:03,011 --> 01:59:04,763
the other too... acid.

1850
01:59:08,975 --> 01:59:12,149
Yes. Yes!

1851
01:59:14,522 --> 01:59:16,238
Dutton, I'm turning off the oxygen.

1852
01:59:16,239 --> 01:59:17,404
Breathe fast and hard.

1853
01:59:17,484 --> 01:59:18,074
No, Jeremy!

1854
01:59:18,075 --> 01:59:19,911
Don't let him cut off my oxygen.

1855
01:59:19,986 --> 01:59:22,455
No! The air in that room is loaded...

1856
01:59:22,456 --> 01:59:23,822
Air doesn't matter.

1857
01:59:23,823 --> 01:59:26,793
Blood does. That's the answer.

1858
01:59:34,417 --> 01:59:37,341
I need 30 seconds
to run a growth program.

1859
01:59:37,342 --> 01:59:39,338
He could die in 30 seconds.

1860
01:59:39,339 --> 01:59:41,387
Besides, Leavitt checked
all the growth programs.

1861
01:59:41,466 --> 01:59:42,761
She might have missed something.

1862
01:59:42,762 --> 01:59:43,602
Epileptics blank out.

1863
01:59:43,635 --> 01:59:45,601
I want to see how the
growth of Andromeda

1864
01:59:45,602 --> 01:59:47,597
is affected by blood
chemistry. The pH...

1865
01:59:47,722 --> 01:59:50,191
Oh, damn!

1866
01:59:52,268 --> 01:59:54,236
You do it.

1867
02:00:10,495 --> 02:00:11,328
Excellent.

1868
02:00:11,329 --> 02:00:13,707
The graph's practically
straight up and down.

1869
02:00:13,790 --> 02:00:15,461
That means Andromeda can only exist

1870
02:00:15,462 --> 02:00:16,880
within a narrow range of pH.

1871
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:19,002
A very narrow range.

1872
02:00:19,003 --> 02:00:21,176
On either side of the
tolerance range, no growth.

1873
02:00:21,256 --> 02:00:22,223
Nothing, right?

1874
02:00:22,224 --> 02:00:23,512
It's exterminated.

1875
02:00:25,844 --> 02:00:27,344
Dutton, our troubles are over.

1876
02:00:27,345 --> 02:00:28,517
Look at your console.

1877
02:00:28,596 --> 02:00:30,724
It grows within
a narrow range of pH.

1878
02:00:30,725 --> 02:00:32,141
A very narrow range.

1879
02:00:32,142 --> 02:00:35,646
If your blood's abnormal,
if it's too acid or alkaline,

1880
02:00:35,770 --> 02:00:38,480
Andromeda can't survive
in the body.

1881
02:00:38,481 --> 02:00:40,277
So breathe as fast as you can.

1882
02:00:40,278 --> 02:00:42,152
Go into respiratory alkalosis.

1883
02:00:47,115 --> 02:00:47,739
Yes, fine.

1884
02:00:47,740 --> 02:00:50,620
That'll shoot your
blood chemistry to hell.

1885
02:00:50,702 --> 02:00:51,997
It's what happens to the baby

1886
02:00:51,998 --> 02:00:53,085
when he cries too much,

1887
02:00:53,086 --> 02:00:54,331
or the old man on Sterno.

1888
02:00:55,790 --> 02:00:57,708
How do you feel?

1889
02:00:57,709 --> 02:00:58,301
Okay.

1890
02:00:58,376 --> 02:01:00,674
A little dizzy, but okay.

1891
02:01:00,795 --> 02:01:02,889
He can't keep breathing
like that forever.

1892
02:01:03,006 --> 02:01:04,051
He'll hyperventilate, pass out.

1893
02:01:04,052 --> 02:01:05,971
We've got to get him something
to alkalize his blood.

1894
02:01:06,092 --> 02:01:08,686
We can't in there.

1895
02:01:08,803 --> 02:01:10,726
Charlie!

1896
02:01:10,805 --> 02:01:14,892
That cage... in the hot room.

1897
02:01:14,893 --> 02:01:17,021
Right in front of you.

1898
02:01:18,104 --> 02:01:20,027
It's alive!

1899
02:01:20,106 --> 02:01:22,655
The rat's been exposed as long as I have.

1900
02:01:22,734 --> 02:01:24,655
Longer. I exposed it to the cultures

1901
02:01:24,656 --> 02:01:25,904
before the seal broke.

1902
02:01:25,987 --> 02:01:26,695
Precisely.

1903
02:01:26,696 --> 02:01:30,121
Andromeda's mutated
to a noninfectious form.

1904
02:01:34,954 --> 02:01:37,252
Holy!

1905
02:01:41,044 --> 02:01:42,544
Where does that gasket lead?

1906
02:01:42,545 --> 02:01:43,387
Central core.

1907
02:01:43,388 --> 02:01:45,347
It connects all the labs.

1908
02:01:49,552 --> 02:01:51,553
The gaskets are decomposing.

1909
02:01:51,554 --> 02:01:52,771
It's Andromeda.

1910
02:01:59,479 --> 02:02:00,103
Next sector.

1911
02:02:00,104 --> 02:02:02,106
There's no substation in this sector.

1912
02:02:14,786 --> 02:02:18,080
Level 5 is sealed.

1913
02:02:18,081 --> 02:02:20,129
Emergency procedures are in effect.

1914
02:02:20,208 --> 02:02:21,423
When the bomb goes off,

1915
02:02:21,424 --> 02:02:23,292
there'll be a thousand mutations.

1916
02:02:23,293 --> 02:02:24,635
Andromeda will spread everywhere.

1917
02:02:24,636 --> 02:02:25,801
They'll never be rid of it.

1918
02:02:25,922 --> 02:02:30,018
There are now five
minutes to self-destruct.

1919
02:02:31,094 --> 02:02:33,554
What about the other levels?

1920
02:02:33,555 --> 02:02:35,226
Can't tell. Each sector seals off

1921
02:02:35,227 --> 02:02:36,393
when it's contaminated,

1922
02:02:36,394 --> 02:02:37,438
even the elevator.

1923
02:02:39,936 --> 02:02:42,109
The defense system is perfect.

1924
02:02:42,230 --> 02:02:44,904
It'll even bury our mistakes.

1925
02:02:46,150 --> 02:02:48,278
What about the central core?

1926
02:02:51,322 --> 02:02:52,993
The core's equipped with safeguards.

1927
02:02:52,994 --> 02:02:53,537
Like what?

1928
02:02:53,616 --> 02:02:54,616
Gas, lasers,

1929
02:02:54,617 --> 02:02:56,335
to prevent escape of lab animals.

1930
02:02:56,411 --> 02:02:57,626
What would my chances be?

1931
02:02:57,627 --> 02:03:00,246
They don't exist for anyone
anywhere if you stay here.

1932
02:03:00,247 --> 02:03:01,748
How do I get into the core?

1933
02:03:01,749 --> 02:03:03,296
Through that service port.

1934
02:03:03,376 --> 02:03:04,042
Go ahead.

1935
02:03:04,043 --> 02:03:07,388
I'll ride shotgun for
you in main control.

1936
02:03:07,463 --> 02:03:09,511
I can't monitor the lasers here.

1937
02:03:09,591 --> 02:03:11,592
Karen, get me a scalpel.

1938
02:03:11,593 --> 02:03:14,177
There are now four minutes

1939
02:03:14,178 --> 02:03:16,556
and 30 seconds to self-destruct.

1940
02:03:20,143 --> 02:03:21,393
Cut it off!

1941
02:03:21,394 --> 02:03:23,647
Cut the panel off.

1942
02:03:26,065 --> 02:03:28,659
Karen, cut it!

1943
02:03:30,153 --> 02:03:32,497
Come on. Hurry up.

1944
02:03:43,166 --> 02:03:46,716
Hey, Doc, you ain't leaving
us here, are you?

1945
02:03:48,671 --> 02:03:51,390
The lasers are tuned low
for small animals, Mark.

1946
02:03:51,466 --> 02:03:54,470
You can make it if you're not
hit along the spinal cord.

1947
02:03:54,594 --> 02:03:59,020
There are now
four minutes to self-destruct.

1948
02:04:12,111 --> 02:04:14,407
That's the
ladder across from you.

1949
02:04:14,408 --> 02:04:15,827
Go before the gas starts.

1950
02:04:24,540 --> 02:04:29,670
There are now three minutes
and 30 seconds to self-destruct.

1951
02:04:29,671 --> 02:04:31,719
That's the gas. Keep going.

1952
02:04:34,926 --> 02:04:37,020
The sensors have picked you up.

1953
02:04:37,021 --> 02:04:37,887
Get moving.

1954
02:04:40,932 --> 02:04:43,230
Duck!

1955
02:04:43,309 --> 02:04:46,108
Keep going.

1956
02:04:46,229 --> 02:04:48,105
Duck!

1957
02:04:48,106 --> 02:04:50,279
Keep going.

1958
02:04:50,358 --> 02:04:52,110
Duck!

1959
02:04:53,861 --> 02:04:57,832
There are now
three minutes to self-destruct.

1960
02:04:59,617 --> 02:05:02,370
No, it's no good.

1961
02:05:02,453 --> 02:05:03,498
The level's contaminated.

1962
02:05:03,499 --> 02:05:04,543
You'll have to go to 3.

1963
02:05:04,622 --> 02:05:06,716
Go to 3!

1964
02:05:06,833 --> 02:05:12,260
There are now two minutes
and 45 seconds to self-destruct.

1965
02:05:12,338 --> 02:05:15,262
Sway! Weave!

1966
02:05:16,884 --> 02:05:20,804
You're zeroed in. Duck!

1967
02:05:20,805 --> 02:05:23,015
There are now two minutes

1968
02:05:23,016 --> 02:05:26,270
and 30 seconds to self-destruct.

1969
02:05:26,352 --> 02:05:29,276
Keep going! You'll make it.

1970
02:05:35,903 --> 02:05:41,285
There are now two minutes
and 15 seconds to self-destruct.

1971
02:05:43,786 --> 02:05:46,460
Fight the effect. It's mostly shock.

1972
02:05:50,668 --> 02:05:53,169
You've lost some time,
but you can still do it.

1973
02:05:53,170 --> 02:05:53,888
See the door?

1974
02:05:53,963 --> 02:05:58,264
There are now two
minutes to self-destruct.

1975
02:06:07,810 --> 02:06:14,864
There is now one minute and
45 seconds to self-destruct.

1976
02:06:20,156 --> 02:06:26,004
There is now one minute and
30 seconds to self-destruct.

1977
02:06:32,335 --> 02:06:33,129
There is now...

1978
02:06:33,130 --> 02:06:34,342
You're in an airlock.

1979
02:06:34,343 --> 02:06:35,131
Turn the wheel.

1980
02:06:35,132 --> 02:06:37,382
...one minute and 15
seconds to self-destruct.

1981
02:06:37,465 --> 02:06:38,924
No, not that one.

1982
02:06:38,925 --> 02:06:41,019
The one near the door.

1983
02:06:47,141 --> 02:06:50,771
There are now
60 seconds to self-destruct.

1984
02:06:55,024 --> 02:06:59,029
There are now 55 seconds to self-destruct.

1985
02:07:02,198 --> 02:07:06,123
There are now 50 seconds to self-destruct.

1986
02:07:07,787 --> 02:07:08,787
Where is it?

1987
02:07:08,788 --> 02:07:11,915
There are now 45 seconds to self-destruct.

1988
02:07:11,916 --> 02:07:13,133
Come on. Where is it?

1989
02:07:13,134 --> 02:07:15,174
Help me!

1990
02:07:15,294 --> 02:07:20,391
There are now 40 seconds to self-destruct.

1991
02:07:23,136 --> 02:07:27,812
There are now 35 seconds to self-destruct.

1992
02:07:30,393 --> 02:07:34,944
There are now 30 seconds to self-destruct.

1993
02:07:37,608 --> 02:07:41,863
There are now 25 seconds to self-destruct.

1994
02:07:43,739 --> 02:07:46,074
Twenty seconds,

1995
02:07:46,075 --> 02:07:48,160
19, 18, 17,

1996
02:07:48,161 --> 02:07:50,209
16,15,

1997
02:07:50,329 --> 02:07:53,415
14,13,12,

1998
02:07:53,416 --> 02:07:56,465
11,10, 9...

1999
02:07:56,544 --> 02:07:58,842
Self-destruct has been canceled.

2000
02:08:08,264 --> 02:08:10,232
Congratulations.

2001
02:08:11,851 --> 02:08:14,060
I take it the bomb didn't...

2002
02:08:14,061 --> 02:08:16,280
No, it didn't.

2003
02:08:16,355 --> 02:08:17,902
Eight seconds to spare.

2004
02:08:17,903 --> 02:08:19,446
Hardly even exciting.

2005
02:08:20,568 --> 02:08:22,569
What's happening?

2006
02:08:22,570 --> 02:08:25,574
The super colony's now off the coast

2007
02:08:25,656 --> 02:08:27,784
and moving southwest across the Pacific.

2008
02:08:27,867 --> 02:08:29,869
Apparently Andromeda
hasn't turned lethal again.

2009
02:08:29,952 --> 02:08:31,247
At least there haven't been

2010
02:08:31,248 --> 02:08:32,790
any reports of bizarre deaths.

2011
02:08:32,791 --> 02:08:34,083
We're applying an adaptation

2012
02:08:34,084 --> 02:08:35,253
of your antidote to it.

2013
02:08:35,374 --> 02:08:36,089
Cloud seeding.

2014
02:08:36,090 --> 02:08:38,302
We're seeding the clouds above Andromeda

2015
02:08:38,303 --> 02:08:40,295
with silver iodide.

2016
02:08:40,296 --> 02:08:41,546
The raindrops will carry the

2017
02:08:41,547 --> 02:08:42,762
organism into the ocean,

2018
02:08:42,763 --> 02:08:44,007
and the alkaline reaction

2019
02:08:44,008 --> 02:08:45,510
from seawater should kill it.

2020
02:08:45,593 --> 02:08:47,469
Just as acids or alkali

2021
02:08:47,470 --> 02:08:49,017
in the blood stopped it.

2022
02:08:51,098 --> 02:08:53,225
This cloud seeding business,

2023
02:08:53,226 --> 02:08:54,603
you absolutely sure it worked?

2024
02:08:54,685 --> 02:08:55,481
You better be.

2025
02:08:55,482 --> 02:08:57,062
All reports indicate

2026
02:08:57,063 --> 02:08:58,906
the experiment was successful.

2027
02:08:58,981 --> 02:09:01,358
Then we can feel confident

2028
02:09:01,359 --> 02:09:03,532
your so-called
biological crisis is over?

2029
02:09:03,611 --> 02:09:05,238
As far as Andromeda's concerned, yes.

2030
02:09:05,321 --> 02:09:06,787
We have the organism at Wildfire

2031
02:09:06,788 --> 02:09:08,124
and we continue to study it.

2032
02:09:08,199 --> 02:09:09,665
We now know beyond a doubt

2033
02:09:09,666 --> 02:09:11,034
that other forms of life

2034
02:09:11,035 --> 02:09:12,412
exist in the universe.

2035
02:09:12,495 --> 02:09:15,664
Thanks to Scoop.

2036
02:09:15,665 --> 02:09:16,211
Yes.

2037
02:09:16,290 --> 02:09:18,211
However, with this new knowledge,

2038
02:09:18,212 --> 02:09:19,461
there's no guarantee

2039
02:09:19,543 --> 02:09:22,262
that another so-called biological crisis

2040
02:09:22,263 --> 02:09:23,546
won't occur again.

2041
02:09:23,547 --> 02:09:25,632
Hmm.

2042
02:09:25,633 --> 02:09:28,102
What do we do about that?

2043
02:09:28,219 --> 02:09:30,595
Precisely, Senator.

2044
02:09:30,596 --> 02:09:32,974
What do we do?
