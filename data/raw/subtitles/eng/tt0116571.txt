00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:59,520
Hi. I'm Grover Beindorf.
I'm 14 years old.

2
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:02,627
<i>I live in Defiance, Ohio,</i>

3
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:06,223
<i>which is somewhere between</i>
<i>Toledo and Hicksville.</i>

4
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,371
<i>It's a nice town,</i>
<i>but pretty average, I guess.</i>

5
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,836
<i>To tell you the truth,</i>
<i>that's how I was, too,</i>

6
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:23,143
<i>that is, until last April,</i>
<i>when everything happened.</i>

7
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,747
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:31,014
<i>Now, if you're going to blame someone,</i>

9
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:32,557
you should blame me.

10
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:36,356
But things just didn't happen
like they were supposed to.

11
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:39,057
It's like everything snowballed on me.

12
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,031
I'm getting ahead of my story.

13
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:47,902
Let's start at the beginning,
when Mom and Dad got married.

14
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:00,940
So.

15
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,103
What did you think?

16
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,111
- It's excellent.
- Except the song.

17
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:11,215
- Stacy, it's their song.
- I still think it sucks.

18
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:16,050
Jeez, Groves, your parents
have been married 18 years?

19
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,252
That's got to be some kind of record.

20
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:21,086
Teddy, Jimmy,
you're going to be late for school.

21
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:23,059
- Don't think it's gonna work.
- Yeah, it will.

22
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,629
- Hi, Louise.
- Hi, kids.

23
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:25,755
Hi, Mrs. Finley.

24
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,629
- Will you get dressed?
- You can't make us.

25
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,793
Yeah, you're not our real mom.

26
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,803
- Bull's-eye!
- Awesome!

27
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,778
That's how I know there's a God.

28
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,479
Louise!

29
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:45,915
I'm coming!

30
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:48,383
Would you just get
the bomb squad dressed?

31
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,022
Shut up!

32
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,957
I don't owe you any more alimony!
What are you talking about?

33
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,618
- Louise!
- Coming!

34
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:56,751
Don't look!

35
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,160
What?

36
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,091
Cosmo.

37
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,289
Shut up!

38
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,460
What do you mean, child support?

39
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:08,129
Why would I owe you child support?
I've got the kids!

40
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:11,072
- Wife Number two.
- Thanks.

41
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,982
- Come on, Stacy, hurry up!
- Wait up.

42
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,091
Morning!

43
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:28,553
Not bad, huh?

44
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:31,393
- How's it going?
- Okay.

45
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,908
- Coming up on the rear.
- No fair.

46
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,103
- Passing on the right.
- Wait up!

47
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:49,272
- By a nose!
- No fair, you're cheating!

48
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,709
Come on, Stace!

49
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:00,585
- Anybody home?
- We're in here.

50
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,596
Here, Fuzzy.

51
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,264
- Morning.
- Morning.

52
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,468
- Where did you go so early?
- To Matt's.

53
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,670
- Did you get our note?
- Yes, thank you.

54
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,771
- You are the note queen.
- Yes, I am, and here's another one.

55
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,850
Today's my Thursday staff meeting.

56
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,454
I'm going to be late.
There's lasagna in the freezer.

57
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:32,149
- Put it in at 5:00 at 350, no higher.
- At 350, no higher.

58
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,782
Smarty, I'll be home to take it out.

59
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,661
So, why were you at Matt's?

60
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,761
He was just helping us with something.

61
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:41,925
What?

62
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,300
- Happy anniversary!
- Happy anniversary.

63
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:52,704
Unwrap it.

64
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,741
It's for both of you. Do it together.

65
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:08,454
- We call it "The Best of the Beindorfs."
- The best part's when I'm born.

66
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,921
Did I say something wrong?

67
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,267
No, honey, why don't we watch it later,
after work...

68
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,630
Listen, kids,

69
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:19,534
Daddy and I have something
we need to talk to you about.

70
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,606
Janet.

71
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,265
Here you go.

72
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:27,676
It's Mystery Meat Day.
Grover Beindorf just can't get enough.

73
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,476
- Say something, Grove.
- Turn it off, Matt.

74
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,313
Oh, baby, come to Papa.

75
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,183
- Next.
- I'm paying for both.

76
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,421
- You're a quarter short.
- It's all I've got.

77
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,929
Move out of the line,
and put something back.

78
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,025
Here.

79
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:53,665
Thanks.

80
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:57,735
Come on, let's go.

81
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,069
Go sit with her.

82
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,071
I can't breathe.

83
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,608
Why not?
You just loaned Brooke Figler lunch.

84
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:07,083
- She's got to be nice to you.
- She doesn't know...

85
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:08,778
- Man.
- Nasty.

86
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:11,820
I'm sorry.

87
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,284
Where are you going, Finley?

88
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,563
- Just chill, man.
- What did you say, Barndoor?

89
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,491
I didn't hear you.

90
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:22,295
I said, "I'm sorry."

91
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:27,165
Good. Now tell me
that you're a skinny, ugly little wussy.

92
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,365
Go, T.J.

93
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,606
I'm a skinny, ugly little wussy.

94
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,474
No shit.

95
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,277
Looks good on you, Beindorf.

96
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,212
Later.

97
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,486
Way to go, Beindorf!

98
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,488
You geek!

99
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:54,191
Loser!

100
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,229
Remember when Krupp
pulled down your gym shorts?

101
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:02,967
Or when he flunked sixth grade and said
he was gonna beat up all fifth graders

102
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,906
but he only beat up you?

103
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:09,538
Or in fourth grade when he smeared
dog crap all over your back

104
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,880
- and called you "Turd Boy"...
- Matt, shut up, okay?

105
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,684
I'm sorry.

106
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,494
My parents are getting separated.

107
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:26,992
Really?

108
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,263
Groves, I'm sorry.

109
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:34,230
Did they say why?

110
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,732
Not really.

111
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,605
I don't mean to scare you,
but that's usually a bad sign.

112
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,202
It means there's a lot wrong.

113
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,079
- Who's moving out, your mom or dad?
- My dad.

114
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:45,743
Also bad.

115
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,981
If your mom's moving out,
it's usually just temporary.

116
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,350
Check out his suitcases.

117
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,754
If most of them are packed,
you're really in trouble.

118
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:55,383
- What do you mean?
- Divorce.

119
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:59,659
No. They're not getting a divorce.
They said it was only a separation.

120
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,993
Divorce isn't even up for consideration.

121
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:05,998
Groves, I hate to break it to you,
but that's what they always say.

122
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,596
First it's separation, then it's divorce.

123
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:10,866
If I were you,

124
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,745
I'd lock them in a closet
until they worked everything out.

125
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:17,179
But look on the bright side.

126
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:20,680
From now on, you get twice the gifts
on your birthday and Christmas.

127
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:25,212
I'm kidding.

128
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,454
Hey.

129
00:10:58,991 --> 00:10:59,958
Hi.

130
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,360
How's it going?

131
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:09,826
Bad.

132
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,228
Same here.

133
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,536
What can we do about it?

134
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:20,977
I don't know.

135
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,552
Have you been
down in the basement again?

136
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,055
I think there's mice down there.

137
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,825
Come on.

138
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:03,246
- Watch your step.
- Stacy, I can't see, honey.

139
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,549
One, two, three!

140
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,124
Surprise!

141
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:08,794
Wow.

142
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:10,993
Oh, my.

143
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:18,836
Do you like it?

144
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,232
What's all this?

145
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,906
Your anniversary party.

146
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:32,046
- When did you kids do all this?
- When we got home from school.

147
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,880
What do you think?

148
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,248
Grover!

149
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:41,323
Honey, you know the rules about this.
You're not supposed to touch it.

150
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,022
It's only for a very special occasion.

151
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:49,424
You guys are getting separated.
What could be more special than that?

152
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,761
Good cake.

153
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,438
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

154
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,567
And you've made the basement
look very festive.

155
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:02,373
We wanted to remind you
of your honeymoon in Hawaii.

156
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,278
There's the lanai you stayed in.

157
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,509
I made it.

158
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:09,815
And Dad,
we even found your old ukulele.

159
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:13,550
- My God, where did you find this?
- It was stuck behind the workbench.

160
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,291
- Why don't you play something?
- Yeah.

161
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,261
No, that's probably not a good idea.

162
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,063
Listen, kids,
I'm not sure you understood.

163
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,295
We did.

164
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,329
You guys are getting separated.

165
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,332
What we don't understand is why.

166
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,011
- Grover...
- Are you two having affairs?

167
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,172
No.

168
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,975
Oh, no. Kids...

169
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:43,813
It's like we said this morning,
Daddy and I are just having some

170
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:49,523
difficulties, and we feel like
we need some time apart. That's all.

171
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,523
Maybe you should get counseling.

172
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:54,432
No, honey, actually,
we don't need counseling.

173
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,732
The truth is,
no one ever really needs counseling.

174
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,804
We just need time apart
from each other.

175
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,904
- No, you don't.
- Grover.

176
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:05,306
You guys spend enough time apart.
Maybe you need some time together.

177
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:10,037
- That's enough, son.
- You guys used to get along just fine.

178
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,879
I remember when you couldn't
keep your hands off each other.

179
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,783
- Grover, let's just stop this, okay?
- Ned, don't yell at him.

180
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,946
I'm not yelling,
I'm trying to get some control here.

181
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,287
You don't get control
by yelling at people.

182
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:23,418
I'm sorry, is there a list of ways
to get control that you've made for us?

183
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,690
Things I'm doing, not doing,
should've done?

184
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,322
- Not doing?
- Yes.

185
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,898
- Okay, the Beindorf family room.
- What about it?

186
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:33,267
Well, supposed to have
an entertainment area,

187
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,136
and a room for pool
and maybe an extra bedroom.

188
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,836
It's been 14 years,
you haven't finished the bathroom.

189
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:42,505
I've been working 14 years, Janet,
trying to afford the house.

190
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,105
And what's my job?

191
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:45,982
Is it a hobby?

192
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:52,383
Excuse me, kids. Great job on the party.

193
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,893
Wait. Dad, you can't leave.

194
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,257
I mean,

195
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,796
the party's not over.

196
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:04,426
Yeah, you've got to watch the tape.
You promised you'd watch it. Come on.

197
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,698
It's really not very long.

198
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,869
Plus, we have one more surprise.

199
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:12,432
Oh, Grover.

200
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,478
Please take the champagne
back upstairs

201
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,275
and put it back where you found it.

202
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,609
Thank you.

203
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:21,375
Label out.

204
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,526
What has gotten into these kids?

205
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,155
Why did you argue
in front of the children?

206
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,326
One thing the book said is,
"Don't argue in front of the children."

207
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,462
Did it also mention
that I would always be at fault?

208
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,938
- What?
- Keep your voice down.

209
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,533
I think they know
there's something wrong here, Janet.

210
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,475
Can't you just be quiet?

211
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,211
- What is that?
- I don't know.

212
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,749
- Grover, what are you doing up there?
- I'm nailing the door shut.

213
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,317
There you go, he's nailing the door shut.

214
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,818
It drives me...

215
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,887
What?

216
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,989
You guys are gonna stay
down there a while.

217
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,192
He's really doing it.
He's nailing the door shut.

218
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:09,495
Grover, stop it right now. What you're
doing is very bad for the wood.

219
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,402
We'll pay for the wood.

220
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:14,896
We'll be back in the morning
and see if you worked anything out.

221
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,211
They got my tools.

222
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:27,708
And the phone's gone, too.

223
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:30,647
Oh, my God!

224
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,722
Boarded up the windows?

225
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,688
We boarded them up
and put cement in the basins.

226
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,492
I used the cement that's been
sitting in the garage for three years.

227
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:41,998
And if you yell for help,
no one will hear you.

228
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,035
Besides, the Bagleys are on vacation.

229
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:47,434
You two are in very serious trouble!
Do you hear me?

230
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:48,870
Very serious trouble!

231
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:51,238
As a matter of fact, starting now,
you're both grounded.

232
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,243
No offense, guys, but

233
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,540
I think you are.

234
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,345
Grover! Stacy!

235
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,082
Good night.

236
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,226
Grover!

237
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,559
Will they be ready
by tomorrow morning?

238
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,222
I don't know, I hope so.

239
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,096
What do you think
they're going to do tonight?

240
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,463
Try to escape.

241
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:00,504
Morning.

242
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:05,316
Morning.

243
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,784
- Morning.
- Good morning.

244
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:13,457
- You guys ready to come out?
- Yes, honey.

245
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,957
We talked through most of our problems
last night

246
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:17,085
and we think we've solved them.

247
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:20,393
Yes, all of them, in fact.
This was a good idea.

248
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,899
Yes, we're fine. Really, we're fine now.

249
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,128
- Dad, is that true?
- Yeah, I can't believe it, but...

250
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,205
- It worked.
- Yeah, you should see us.

251
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,776
- Really?
- Yes.

252
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:34,202
- Swear to God?
- Swear to God.

253
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,281
Come on, we're fine now.
We're really happy.

254
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:37,746
You should see us.

255
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,715
So, what did you guys talk about?

256
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,050
Everything. What didn't we talk about?

257
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:48,115
- I need to be home more often.
- And I need to be less controlling

258
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:49,461
and organized.

259
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:52,155
And critical,
and I need to finish things that I start.

260
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,630
I'm actually not very critical.
You're critical.

261
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,224
- Of the two of us, I'd say...
- No, you're critical.

262
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,997
- When am I critical?
- You hate my hair.

263
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:01,197
I love the claw. I just can't touch it.

264
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,604
- Doesn't make me critical.
- It's not nice of you

265
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,200
to criticize the one thing
that I'm very sensitive about.

266
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,041
No. Wait! Stop! What are you doing?

267
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,378
You guys lied. You're not better at all.

268
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:15,182
Grover, let Mommy and...

269
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,126
Come on!

270
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,521
Let us out, damn it!

271
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:24,921
I got it!

272
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,193
- This is not funny!
- Wait! What about this?

273
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,266
Yeah, come on!

274
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,943
- Why did you argue?
- Why did you have to say I was critical?

275
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,210
Because you are.
Grover, are you on drugs?

276
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:49,986
Yeah, I'm on heroin,
and Stacy's on crack.

277
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,923
- Happy now?
- He's kidding.

278
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:55,726
You'd better be joking!

279
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,694
Do you hear me?
Gregory Alan Beindorf, do you hear me?

280
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,195
What is wrong with you?

281
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,132
You guys are splitting up,
that's what's wrong with me.

282
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:07,569
Now get down there,
and start solving your problems.

283
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:13,706
Not critical?

284
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,381
Hi, Mr. Mitchell?

285
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,882
Yeah, okay.
My dad can't come to work today.

286
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,054
He's barfing up all over the place.

287
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:27,625
Okay. Thanks.

288
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,387
Breakfast. Lunch.

289
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,372
Hurry up.

290
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,300
You can't tell any of your friends
at school.

291
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,466
I won't.

292
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,305
Hey, you Beindorfs.

293
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:51,410
Where are your folks?
They're late for work.

294
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,848
Good morning, Chief Rocco.

295
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,478
They got the bug that's going around.

296
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,916
I didn't know there was one.

297
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,749
Yeah, it's really bad.

298
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,519
Especially for old people.

299
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,093
What?

300
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:12,859
Shut up.

301
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,275
Grover.

302
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:22,238
Grover.

303
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,283
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

304
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:32,548
Yeah, there is.
You've been acting weird all day.

305
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:35,354
Listen, if you're still freaked
about your parents, you can tell me.

306
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,950
I've been through it.

307
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,393
Not through this.

308
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,456
What do you mean?

309
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:49,097
- Promise not to tell.
- Of course.

310
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,109
Okay.

311
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:53,107
Do you remember yesterday
when you said

312
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,372
that I should lock my parents
in a closet?

313
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:56,538
Yeah.

314
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:58,346
Well,

315
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,250
I did, but not in the closet.

316
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:04,886
I locked them in the basement.

317
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:08,186
But I didn't really lock them in.

318
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:09,917
I nailed the door shut.

319
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:14,021
And I told them I wasn't gonna let them
out until they talked out their problems.

320
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:16,362
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

321
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,501
Yeah, you are. You're yanking my chain.

322
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:23,333
Matt, I swear. I swear.

323
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,342
It's like something came over me.

324
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,838
I had to do it.

325
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,679
- Where are they now?
- They're still down there.

326
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,552
You kidnapped your parents?

327
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:43,818
I am impressed, Barndoor.

328
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,431
Who would have thought
that a wussy like you

329
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,091
could pull off something like that?

330
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,277
Please, tell me you're kidding.

331
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,439
Come on, faster, faster.

332
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:11,586
Anybody home?

333
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,783
What is it? One of them? Wait.

334
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,055
- Got it.
- Give it here.

335
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,252
Oh, please.

336
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,424
- Who's out there?
- I don't know. Let me see.

337
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,198
Give me whatever it is
you're using to do that.

338
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:25,701
Come in here and get it, son.

339
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:28,663
- Hi, Mr. Beindorf.
- Move!

340
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,468
- Hi, Matt.
- Hi, Mrs. Beindorf. How are you?

341
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,373
How do you think we are, Matty-boy?

342
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:36,709
- Don't yell at him. He could help us.
- Maybe I should ask if he likes cake.

343
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:38,077
Do you like cake, Matt?

344
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,051
- No.
- No, that's mine!

345
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:44,054
- I'm trying to get their attention.
- I'm in the Twilight Zone.

346
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:07,612
Matt.

347
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,610
You know you were always my favorite
of Grover's friends.

348
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,880
I don't know
where he got this stupid idea,

349
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:15,145
but do you think
you could talk him out of it?

350
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:16,618
- What do you want?
- Thank you.

351
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:20,555
- Phone. Somebody's on the phone!
- No, she's not here right now.

352
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:23,093
Ralph Doyle? Got it.

353
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:25,395
Hello! We're locked
in the basement! Help!

354
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:29,626
The noise? Yeah, it's the TV.

355
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:30,701
Bye.

356
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:35,034
How come you can tell your friends,
but I can't tell mine?

357
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:36,741
Hey, everybody.

358
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:39,610
Oh, no.

359
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:43,175
- What is that?
- I don't know.

360
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:44,848
- Hello?
- Is someone else there?

361
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,851
Is someone else there?
Excuse me, hey, who are you?

362
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:50,010
Hello, who are you? Excuse me.

363
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:52,218
I'm your new security guard.

364
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:54,218
Oh, my God.

365
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:56,155
This door's gotta go.

366
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:01,265
Folks,

367
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,158
you're looking at "The Enforcer 2000."

368
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:09,429
It's the best security door
that money can buy.

369
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:13,741
Now, there's no need to thank me.
It's my gift to you.

370
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:19,045
Since you're my favorite new customers,
here's a little bonus gift.

371
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,746
A shiny new pair of jumper cables,

372
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:25,448
which just so happen to be connected
to two, count them, two

373
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:28,788
12-volt car batteries in my backpack.

374
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:33,161
That's why you're going
to hand over the knife, Mr. Beindorf.

375
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:36,464
What are you talking about?

376
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:40,504
Let's just say that this tomato here
is you. Gentlemen, please.

377
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:42,130
Here you go.

378
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:56,586
- Well, he wouldn't use that on us.
- No, of course not.

379
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:57,655
So let's go.

380
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:00,551
After you, hon.

381
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,359
Give it to me, Mr. Beindorf.

382
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:03,719
Of course.

383
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:07,258
Now give me whatever Mrs. Beindorf
was digging with.

384
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:11,035
That was mine.
He was using this piece of chair.

385
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:14,969
Give it to me, Mr. Beindorf.
And give me the rest of the chair, too.

386
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:19,243
Good.

387
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:21,641
Why don't you just tell him everything?

388
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,737
Maybe he'd like
my social security number.

389
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,678
I'm surprised you're not out there
helping them.

390
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:27,513
If you were, they'd never finish.

391
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,786
Thanks, big guy.

392
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:32,514
- Okay, we're all done.
- Good.

393
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:34,923
Catch you later.

394
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:38,590
Who is this guy?

395
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,291
Remember,
this hurts us more than it hurts you.

396
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:49,533
- You want a ride?
- Yeah, that would be good.

397
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:52,139
Groves, I've got a way to keep an eye
on your parents.

398
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:53,574
You can use my video equipment

399
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:56,238
hooked to the cable
on the basement TV.

400
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:57,372
No.

401
00:26:57,482 --> 00:27:00,144
Well, hey, man, you gotta
disconnect your doorbell.

402
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,185
Otherwise your parents'll know
when somebody rings.

403
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,278
- You can use my Christmas lights...
- No.

404
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,387
Wait a second.

405
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:10,655
I don't get it. Why are you helping me?

406
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:17,198
It's like I told you.
I think what you're doing is a good idea.

407
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:22,867
No. But you hate me, remember?
You've always hated me.

408
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:27,409
That's before I respected you.
Okay, buddy?

409
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:28,771
Later.

410
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:37,911
- Man, I still think I had a good idea.
- Yeah, well, I got a better one.

411
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:44,256
Hello, Dad. Hi, Mrs. Burtis.

412
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:46,354
Changing your will again?

413
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,526
I think I better be going.

414
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,973
- Bye, Mrs. Burtis.
- Bye. Nice to meet you.

415
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:58,201
- Say hi to your husband for me.
- I will.

416
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,142
What class did you say
this was for, T. J?

417
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,945
Sociology, Mom.

418
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,577
It's a trust experiment.

419
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,784
Sociology? This is kind of fun.

420
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:15,518
You know, they used to take us
on wheelchairs, and...

421
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:23,898
Hang on, Dad.

422
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,564
Experiment complete.

423
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:32,641
Except one thing.

424
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,401
We don't take Sociology.

425
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:36,070
You guys should pay more attention.

426
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:43,051
Wait a second. What are you doing?
They can't go down there.

427
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:45,413
Yes, they can. I paid for the door.

428
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:47,991
Now, open it.
I can't hold them much longer.

429
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:49,925
Hurry! Hurry!

430
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:54,991
- Open the door!
- I'll get it!

431
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:57,060
Come on! Hurry up!

432
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,461
This way, everybody!

433
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:03,103
Push them in!

434
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:09,405
Thank you.

435
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:13,474
- What is going on?
- I don't know!

436
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,452
Who are these people?

437
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,011
Grover!

438
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,183
No, wait a second! They can't stay here!

439
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,157
Look, it took over three hours
getting them here.

440
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,728
We ain't taking them back!

441
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:27,194
No. Stop! You can't do this!

442
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:30,233
Listen, dude, your parents aren't
the only ones with problems, okay?

443
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:32,166
My dad treats Mom like dirt.

444
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,795
My dad's coming up
on his second year with Louise.

445
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:36,268
So what?

446
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:39,343
So he always gets divorced
on his second year. You know that.

447
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,036
It's like clockwork. Come on, Groves.

448
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:44,638
We'll do some massive group therapy
on them. It'll be fun.

449
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:46,216
MATT: Teddy. Stop it.

450
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:48,182
What are they doing here?

451
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:51,287
- Well, I couldn't leave them at home.
- Here you go, Matt.

452
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:54,916
- You're such a good doggy.
- You brought Cosmo?

453
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:58,855
- T.J. brought Spot.
- Say hi, Spot.

454
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,488
- A snake?
- A boa constrictor.

455
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,863
- Cool.
- Where do you want the sleeping bag?

456
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,333
What is all this?

457
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,300
Dude, our parents could be
down there for months.

458
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:09,770
Make way.

459
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:15,068
- Somebody had to have seen you guys.
- Nobody saw us, all right? Trust me.

460
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:16,975
I can't see.

461
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:21,550
Get off of my leg. Get off.
I've got business to do.

462
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,620
Get away.

463
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:25,655
People, if we could just...

464
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:26,857
Hello!

465
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:28,047
Go ahead.

466
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,148
You don't understand.

467
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,057
We've been trying this for a little while.
They don't listen.

468
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,426
Maybe you could come downstairs,
be a little more comfortable.

469
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:34,725
It could be a while.

470
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,599
Wait a minute.

471
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:39,261
You mean we're going to be locked
in a basement for a long time?

472
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,133
That's some kind of joke, right?

473
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,639
I don't know, I read an article
about some people

474
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:45,231
who were locked in a basement.

475
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:48,437
The neighbor came and found them,
hanged to death.

476
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:51,378
Jimmy!

477
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:05,828
Hello. Sorry.

478
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,630
Jimmy, what are you doing?
Get those things outside.

479
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,062
Incoming!

480
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:20,945
What are you guys doing?

481
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:23,739
No rules, man! Boogie down!

482
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,142
We'll punish the parents tomorrow.

483
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:30,119
I don't want to punish them, okay.
I want to help them!

484
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:11,892
Cosmo!

485
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,133
Grover, honey!

486
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:54,171
Hi.

487
00:32:56,641 --> 00:33:00,042
Grover, listen, your mother
and my problems aside,

488
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,668
this is completely out of hand now.

489
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,610
I know.

490
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,308
What do I do?

491
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,974
- What do you do?
- It's very simple.

492
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:09,610
All you have to do is let us out.

493
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,882
You listen to me, sonny boy.

494
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:15,822
The second that I get out of here,
I'm having you arrested.

495
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:20,664
That's right. Yeah. This is
unlawful restraint. Now, that's a felony.

496
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:22,623
- Honey.
- Come here!

497
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:27,701
I'm going to have you arrested, too.

498
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:32,207
Oh, sweetheart. Here, darling, take this.

499
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:35,640
You know?

500
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:39,942
What is it with you people?
Have you ever heard of dusting?

501
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:41,715
Here.

502
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,247
Donald's allergic to mold.

503
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:50,120
Honey, if anything,
the house is spotless.

504
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:54,656
<i>So, when you're frightened,</i>
<i>just do like my book says,</i>

505
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,390
<i>"Feel the fear, and go for it."</i>

506
00:33:57,935 --> 00:34:01,996
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>"Feel the fear, and go for it."</i>

507
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:06,506
Sorry about last night.
I just wanted to have some fun.

508
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,340
Fun time is over, Stace.

509
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,807
- Why, are you letting them out?
- How can I? I'm a felon.

510
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:15,883
I'm gonna do what we started out to do,
get Mom and Dad back together.

511
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:17,716
They need our help,
so we're gonna help them.

512
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:20,256
- How?
- I don't know yet. I need time to think.

513
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:24,620
- What about the other parents?
- Stacy, they're not our problem.

514
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:31,599
Okay, make sure
everybody gets some breakfast.

515
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:34,466
And don't let T.J. out of your sight.

516
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:36,930
Good morning.

517
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:42,479
Lovely day.

518
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:51,578
- Lots of marshmallows.
- More marshmallows.

519
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,054
All right.

520
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,979
- What are these?
- Crunch-berry burgers.

521
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:52,381
Delicious.

522
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:03,158
Excuse me.

523
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,297
If we could gather around?

524
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:11,725
Ned and I just want to tell you
how embarrassed we are and sorry,

525
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:14,798
and really hope
we're going to get out soon.

526
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:17,170
But until we do, I just thought
maybe it would be a good idea

527
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:18,867
if we laid some ground rules

528
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:21,706
so that we all just got along better.

529
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:24,779
First of all, if you have any questions,
please don't...

530
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:27,212
I do. Listen.

531
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:30,949
You could actually...
I need some help with something.

532
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:33,080
You don't happen to have a cigarette,
do you?

533
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,215
No.

534
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:37,052
No, in fact,
we don't allow smoking in the house.

535
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:40,025
Oh, well, I guess I'll just go outside.

536
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:43,563
- What a charming...
- Secondly,

537
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:47,331
we are down here, so we might as well
make the best of it, and...

538
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:50,502
Just like that, just make the best of it?

539
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:52,667
Did you hear that, Gwen?

540
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:55,837
T.J. did say something about sleeping
bags, in case we have to stay...

541
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:58,882
Listen, honey.
We don't need sleeping bags

542
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:03,051
because we're not staying another night
in this godforsaken...

543
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:05,687
Oh, sweetheart.

544
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,588
Oh, my God, give me the roll.

545
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:12,792
So, Ned, how long have you been
remodeling down here?

546
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:14,458
Well, I...

547
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,658
About 14 years!

548
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:21,829
Well, takes time.
So, is your bathroom still working?

549
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:25,373
Yes. Toilet, sink, it all works.

550
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:26,568
- Louise?
- Yes.

551
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:29,441
Would you run interference
for me, please?

552
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:35,686
<i>Mine eyes have seen the glory</i>
<i>of the coming of the Lord</i>

553
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:40,583
<i>Where the grapes of wrath are stored</i>

554
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:44,320
I'm not being punished because
your marriage is falling apart, buddy.

555
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,896
I'm holding you personally responsible
for this.

556
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:50,297
- Sounds like some sort of threat.
- Well, is that what you think?

557
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:53,062
Dad, can you come up here
for a second?

558
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:57,203
Go ahead, wussy.

559
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:02,839
Yes, what is it?

560
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:06,547
Mr. Mitchell just called. He wants you
to be at the airport in one hour

561
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:09,518
with the plans for the Lakewood mall.

562
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,180
Good, then it's not too late. Great.

563
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:16,850
Let me out of here right now,
and I can still make the flight.

564
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,656
- I don't think so, Dad.
- Found it.

565
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:19,752
- What do you mean?
- Good.

566
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,094
- Where are you going?
- The airport.

567
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:24,167
We told Mr. Mitchell you were still sick.

568
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:26,896
Wait. You don't understand. I worked
very hard on this. I can't blow it.

569
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:30,440
Dude, just chill out, all right!
It's just a mall. Later.

570
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,907
Ned, would you like to play Operation?

571
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:37,271
Stacy!

572
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:46,723
Bombs away!

573
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:48,116
Stop it.

574
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,719
Guys, don't ring the doorbell
until I tell you.

575
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,262
We didn't.

576
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:06,468
- Yeah?
- Are the Beindorfs home?

577
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,046
No. They're at the doctor's.
I'm babysitting.

578
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:13,875
Well, I brought them
some chicken soup.

579
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,682
Thanks.

580
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:18,710
"Feel the fear, and go for it."

581
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:30,052
"Feel the fear, and go for it."

582
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:32,618
Feel the fear.

583
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,188
Feel the fear.

584
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:44,231
You owe me a quarter.

585
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:06,329
<i>Thank you for joining us.</i>
<i>I'm Robin Leach</i>

586
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:09,695
<i>with those champagne wishes</i>
<i>and caviar dreams.</i>

587
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,458
- <i>We'll look forward to joining you...</i>
- Incoming!

588
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:16,131
- <i>... on the next edition of...</i>
- This way, my friend.

589
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:20,336
Hey, guys.

590
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:23,939
Everything okay?

591
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:26,148
- Everything is just groovy.
- Fine.

592
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,812
Well, listen.

593
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:32,377
I brought some company.

594
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:36,316
I think we can help her.

595
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:39,955
Hi.

596
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,767
Hi.

597
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:55,107
Hi. I'm Cindy Figler, Brooke's mom.

598
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:58,274
I'm here for the emergency
PTA meeting.

599
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,515
Come on in. Everybody's downstairs.

600
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:07,691
Cool.

601
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:15,392
Hello. My daughter says there's
some kind of health problem at school.

602
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:17,296
- Yeah, lice.
- Lice?

603
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:20,295
I don't understand.

604
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:23,237
Isn't that some disease
from the Middle Ages?

605
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:25,108
Hi.

606
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,507
Everybody's right down here. Go ahead.

607
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:28,635
That way.

608
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:30,270
That's your mom?

609
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:33,579
Is this the PTA meeting?

610
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:34,776
Mom.

611
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:38,820
Brooke, don't call me Mom.
I have a name. What is it?

612
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:40,348
What is it?

613
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:41,981
- Cindy.
- Thank you.

614
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:43,218
- Fresh meat.
- Excuse me.

615
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,988
What seems to be the problem here?

616
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:46,960
- We've been kidnapped, honey.
- Kidnapped?

617
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:50,090
My name is Gwenna.
This is my husband, Donald.

618
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,566
Everybody, let's get started.

619
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:56,602
Just gather around the door.
We're going to start group therapy.

620
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:58,504
What? Group therapy?

621
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:01,912
That's funny. You're gonna need
physical therapy when I'm done.

622
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:03,445
What's going on?

623
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:05,845
- You understand me?
- We'll explain it to you.

624
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,919
Mom, you dress like me,
you look like me, you talk like me,

625
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:10,418
you say "cool," Mom.

626
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:12,687
Not group therapy.

627
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,348
It was a nice try.

628
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:15,425
Now.

629
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:18,153
Does anybody
wanna play some football?

630
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:21,264
Guys!

631
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,264
All right, there's no need to shout.

632
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:27,496
I always believe we should
relate to children as adults and peers.

633
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,971
I think if we talk to them very calmly...

634
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:33,467
Watch this. Brooke, honey.

635
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:38,809
- Come here.
- Go deep.

636
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,583
Brooke, it's Cindy.

637
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:43,448
Obviously, you're feeling confused
about something.

638
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:45,655
Brooke, darling.

639
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:47,651
This way.

640
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:55,131
Hey, Barndoor. Incoming.

641
00:43:57,434 --> 00:43:58,401
This way!

642
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:02,762
- Dude!
- Why did you do that?

643
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:07,843
Shut up, okay? Everybody just shut up,
and listen for a second.

644
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:09,575
Come on, Groves. You don't...

645
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,917
Your parents are here because
you guys said they needed help.

646
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:21,853
Now you could just care less.
You're too busy playing football

647
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:24,086
or watching TV or having some party.

648
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:27,026
Who died and made you housemom?

649
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:31,826
I've got news for all of you.
This was my idea, remember?

650
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:37,239
It's not a joke, and it's not a party.
I'm not doing this to impress anybody.

651
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:41,442
You got that, Matt?
Or are you too busy kissing up to T. J?

652
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:46,082
Well, what's wrong with that?

653
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,650
Go ahead.

654
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:54,090
Beat me up.

655
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:55,384
T.J., let him go.

656
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:57,653
"T.J., let him go."

657
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:01,462
From now on, you're gonna start
to listen to what I have to say.

658
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:04,162
Or I'm gonna let all the parents out.

659
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:06,563
Come on.

660
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:09,538
You're such a bully.
My mother needs help.

661
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,902
Dude, let him go.

662
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:13,674
You guys heard the man.

663
00:45:14,578 --> 00:45:16,409
Now, let's listen up.

664
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,717
Okay. First order of business.

665
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:30,693
We gotta clean the house. After that,

666
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:33,889
we're going to make
this group therapy thing work.

667
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:37,660
But, Grover, how are we going
to get them to listen to us?

668
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:40,896
I've got an idea.

669
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:47,100
Don't hover over me.
You made me drop the Adam's apple.

670
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:50,344
I'm sorry, Vic. My God, it's just a game.

671
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:54,684
They've been vacuuming up there
for over an hour.

672
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:56,309
I hope they haven't stained my carpet.

673
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,944
What do you use?

674
00:45:58,055 --> 00:46:00,489
For really tough ones,
I dab a little detergent.

675
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:03,253
Then I sprinkle
with a little talcum powder.

676
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,418
Does that blot?

677
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:07,691
Hello. What is this, vacation?

678
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:12,791
We're being outwitted by a bunch
of snot-nosed kids. Come on.

679
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:14,393
There's gotta be a way out of here.

680
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:17,269
Excuse me, I'm not sure
who elected you mayor of the basement

681
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:19,774
but this is my house,
and I also happen to be an architect,

682
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:21,742
so I think I would know
every nook and cranny...

683
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:23,176
Of course.

684
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,339
- What?
- The laundry chute.

685
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:27,843
Do you remember
when we bought the house,

686
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,249
there was a laundry chute that went
from our bedroom to the basement?

687
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:32,686
You closed it 'cause you were scared
the kids would fall through.

688
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,485
- It's under the drywall.
- The laundry chute!

689
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:36,320
Where are the plans?

690
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:39,320
Now we're going up the laundry chute.

691
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,196
<i>Even marry your own brother?</i>

692
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:48,498
<i>He's not my brother. He was</i>
<i>my brother, but he's my husband now.</i>

693
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:51,597
Hi. You don't happen to have
a cigarette, do you?

694
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:53,676
Yes. As a matter of fact, I do.

695
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:56,337
I have one cigarette
that I've carried in my purse

696
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:58,937
ever since I quit smoking five years ago.

697
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:03,645
Any time I get the urge, I pull it out,
and I look at it, and I say,

698
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:06,813
"Who's stronger, you or me?"

699
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:10,257
That cigarette...
That's so good. Good for you.

700
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,385
- Thanks.
- Can I have it?

701
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:15,590
No. It has sentimental value.

702
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:19,692
Don't label them all, all right?
This crap's labeled, these aren't.

703
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,202
- I just...
- Found it!

704
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:22,431
- Found it.
- Got it!

705
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,803
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.

706
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,806
Okay. Here we go. Let's see.

707
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:31,312
Watch out.

708
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:35,412
Stop that, Grover.

709
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:39,886
Watch out.

710
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:47,263
Grover, what are you...

711
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:50,895
- Is that a camera?
- It has a camera for a head.

712
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:58,832
<i>Testing. Testing. Testing.</i>

713
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:02,844
<i>Five, four, three, two...</i>

714
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:07,447
<i>Hello, and welcome</i>

715
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:10,585
<i>to</i> The Grover Beindorf Hour,

716
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:13,612
<i>live from up above.</i>

717
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:16,822
<i>These are my assistants.</i>

718
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:19,519
<i>We are here to help you.</i>

719
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:21,491
Oh, my God.

720
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:23,289
Did you say something, Mom?

721
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:25,733
Yeah, the holes.

722
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:27,565
If you're mad about the holes,
don't worry.

723
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:29,536
I promise, it may take 30 years

724
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,268
but I'll pay you back for them.

725
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:34,970
<i>Okay, everybody, let's get started.</i>

726
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:37,444
- Mrs. Finley, please move the TV...
- <i>I've had enough.</i>

727
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:40,983
...under the camera, everybody make
a semicircle around the TV

728
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,177
and we'll begin with a little music

729
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:46,814
to remind us of better days gone by.

730
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:48,784
Remember this one?

731
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:56,261
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

732
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:02,271
<i>No. We're not just getting started,</i>
<i>we're finishing.</i>

733
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:05,170
<i>It's ending, it's over right now!</i> Finito!

734
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,242
Pull it up!

735
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:08,942
- Faster!
- Teddy, Jimmy. Pull it up.

736
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,739
I hate that song.

737
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:13,577
That was our song.

738
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:16,883
Well, how am I supposed
to remember that?

739
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,883
- I gotta get out of here.
- It was.

740
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:21,116
<i>Everyone is going to participate, Dad.</i>

741
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:22,486
And why's that, son?

742
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:26,893
<i>Well, because if you don't,</i>
<i>we won't feed you. Then,</i>

743
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:32,998
<i>we'll shut off the water, which means,</i>
<i>once you flush that toilet,</i>

744
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:34,762
<i>your drinking water's gone.</i>

745
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:37,032
- You wouldn't.
- Of course he wouldn't.

746
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,108
<i>Oh, yes, we would, Louise.</i>

747
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:41,977
<i>Now, move the TV.</i>

748
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:43,837
Come on, help me move the TV.

749
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:46,775
<i>It will start out easy.</i>
<i>I promise, it won't be hard.</i>

750
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,846
<i>When we're through,</i>
<i>we'll have a little lunch.</i>

751
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:51,921
- <i>Maybe.</i>
- <i>How's that?</i>

752
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:54,122
<i>You know, my son's got a point.</i>

753
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:56,757
T.J., I just wanted to say...

754
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:01,228
- What's wrong?
- What's the matter?

755
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:03,094
What's happening?

756
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:06,936
- <i>Help!</i>
- <i>Do something!</i>

757
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:11,404
- What do we do?
- Stacy, call 911!

758
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:14,236
Breathe in his mouth!

759
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:18,676
<i>Dad, cut it out. Everyone sit down,</i>
<i>and let's get this thing going.</i>

760
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:21,546
- Please.
- He's trying to breathe on his own.

761
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:24,347
- Get off me.
- It worked.

762
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:28,456
He's alive. Did you see that? He's alive.

763
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:29,616
Cool.

764
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:32,593
- That just wasn't funny at all.
- At least I tried.

765
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,596
Okay. Everybody,

766
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:35,732
<i>settle down.</i>

767
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:37,029
<i>settle down.</i>

768
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:41,301
I think that the kids
have a very good idea here.

769
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:45,273
It's obviously important to them,
and I think that we should cooperate.

770
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:47,907
I certainly don't want
to drink toilet water.

771
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:49,205
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

772
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:51,576
<i>Yes, I think my wife is right.</i>

773
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:54,949
<i>Why don't we get in that circle thing,</i>
<i>that they were saying?</i>

774
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:57,450
Good, good, good. Okay.

775
00:50:58,021 --> 00:51:00,489
Okay, let's start out easy,
by going down the line,

776
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:02,649
and saying our names and occupations.

777
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,928
We'll start on Dad's end. Dad?

778
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:07,591
Dad.

779
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:09,922
<i>Ned Beindorf.</i>

780
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:13,400
<i>I'm an architect.</i>
<i>I work at Mitchell Engineering.</i>

781
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:15,698
<i>Or at least I did.</i>

782
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:21,909
<i>Oh, me? I'm Cindy Figler.</i>

783
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:26,847
<i>I'm a dental hygienist by day,</i>
<i>and I'm a performance artist by night.</i>

784
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:28,315
Mom, you're a waitress.

785
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:30,443
<i>Brooke, I am not a waitress.</i>

786
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:32,954
<i>You know I get up</i>
<i>and perform those pieces.</i>

787
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:35,183
<i>I only serve coffee between sets.</i>

788
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:38,490
Anyhow, I think it's way cool
that you kids

789
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:41,063
have chosen to share your feelings
with us.

790
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:43,430
God, she's doing it again.

791
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:44,625
What? Your mom's okay.

792
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:46,827
She's talking like me. I can't stand it.

793
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:48,870
What's she talking about?

794
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:52,401
<i>I think we should all hold hands.</i>

795
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:54,973
Mom, please stop it.

796
00:51:55,812 --> 00:52:00,078
I'm Victor Finley.
But everybody just calls me Vic.

797
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,610
Hi, Vic.

798
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:05,947
<i>I'm a salesman at Buckeye Big and Tall.</i>
<i>You know.</i>

799
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:09,323
<i>"If you're big and tall,</i>
<i>and you want to look sporty,</i>

800
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:13,192
<i>"come on down to Buckeye's,</i>
<i>and ask for Shorty."</i>

801
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:19,335
<i>Hi.</i>

802
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:25,030
I'm Louise Finley,
and I am a part-time cosmetologist

803
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:29,077
at Stang's Pharmacy,
and I'm Vic's full-time audience.

804
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:30,168
Yes, well.

805
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:35,115
I'm always getting standing ovations,
especially in bed.

806
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:43,716
This is great. We're all talking.

807
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:45,917
Let's continue.

808
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:47,724
Mom?

809
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,229
Yes?

810
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:57,296
What were you doing?

811
00:52:57,407 --> 00:53:01,343
<i>Just stretching, honey. My back hurts</i>
<i>very much. I didn't sleep well.</i>

812
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:06,381
<i>I'm Janet Beindorf,</i>
<i>and I'm a loan officer at Defiance Bank.</i>

813
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,916
<i>I'm in charge of</i>

814
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:12,213
keeping 317 credit histories up to date

815
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:14,620
and ready at a moment's notice.

816
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,121
So, you're the one!

817
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:28,370
He loves to play games
with finance people.

818
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:31,331
Stop it. Just stop it.

819
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:35,936
<i>Next.</i>

820
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,013
Dad?

821
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:41,575
<i>Yes, I'm Donald Krupp, attorney at law.</i>

822
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:45,454
<i>I want you kids to know</i>
<i>that you are guilty of kidnapping</i>

823
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:50,356
<i>under Ohio revised code,</i>
<i>Section 2905.01.</i>

824
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:53,293
<i>This is an aggravated felony</i>
<i>of the first degree.</i>

825
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:56,991
- <i>Second degree under the revised code.</i>
- <i>Gwenna, I'm talking.</i>

826
00:53:58,034 --> 00:54:00,400
Mrs. Krupp, what were you saying?

827
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:07,510
<i>Gwenna Krupp, homemaker.</i>

828
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:18,843
That's it. I've had it. This is ridiculous.
Your son is truly certifiable.

829
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:20,888
Wait a minute.

830
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:22,985
- My son is certifiable?
- Yeah, your son.

831
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,287
How about when
the yearbook comes out

832
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:25,554
and your kid's picture's gonna be there,

833
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:28,187
"Most likely to be a serial killer."
That's your boy.

834
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:30,799
Everybody just settle down, okay?

835
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:35,636
<i>That's right. Go ahead, push me.</i>
<i>That's worth a few thousand bucks.</i>

836
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,238
<i>Come on. Go ahead.</i>

837
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:41,141
Okay, everybody settle down.

838
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:43,439
<i>Violence doesn't solve anything.</i>

839
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:50,582
- This is better than <i>American Gladiator.</i>
- Give him a left.

840
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,757
<i>Everybody has to take a deep breath.</i>

841
00:54:55,191 --> 00:54:56,624
The squirt guns.

842
00:54:57,093 --> 00:54:58,151
Hurry.

843
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,593
You're acting like children.

844
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:08,466
You take your dad, I'll take mine.

845
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,457
- I'm gonna faint.
- This is horrible.

846
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:32,752
Louise, I'm sorry.
I didn't know what it was.

847
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:35,395
What can I do? I'm sorry.

848
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:37,689
<i>We're taking a break.</i>

849
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:41,362
<i>But you guys aren't getting any lunch,</i>
<i>you're not getting any dinner,</i>

850
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:44,929
<i>you're not getting anything,</i>
<i>until you apologize.</i>

851
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:52,713
He started it.

852
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:58,183
<i>Janet? Ralph Doyle here.</i>
<i>Listen, I'm leaving town on Monday.</i>

853
00:55:58,288 --> 00:56:00,813
<i>Please give me a call before then.</i>

854
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:06,322
So, what's next?

855
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,855
We just wait.

856
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,265
- My dad's pretty stubborn, you know?
- Yeah, so is ours.

857
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:17,069
You know, your mom's been
handling this the best of all.

858
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:20,040
Yeah. She should. She's been
in therapy since the day I was born.

859
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:21,770
Well. It worked.

860
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:24,540
She's always been
the most popular mom on the block.

861
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:26,774
That was okay when I was seven.

862
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,918
Now she wants to, like, go
and hang out with me and my friends,

863
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:31,680
or worse, go out with us.

864
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,323
I just wish she'd learn
to stay out of my life.

865
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:38,120
At least she cares enough
to try to stay in it.

866
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:44,790
You know,
I don't see why this is necessary.

867
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:48,598
That old fart still thinks he's chief
of police. He's dangerous, okay?

868
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:51,437
Yeah, but I don't know about this.

869
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:53,907
All right. Prepare for demonstration.

870
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:57,039
Now, it's just really quite simple, okay?

871
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:01,009
Rocco trips over a series of
carefully disguised wires,

872
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:02,477
<i>et voila!</i>

873
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:06,312
- Awesome.
- Wow.

874
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:11,651
I think you might want to give this
a little more thought.

875
00:57:12,996 --> 00:57:16,295
- I think maybe this'll work for you.
- Thank you.

876
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:21,228
Grover?

877
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:25,799
<i>Grover? Grover.</i>

878
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:29,808
- Yeah, Mom?
- <i>Can I talk to you upstairs, please?</i>

879
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:34,080
- Grover, whose dog is that?
- Matt's.

880
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:36,443
This has gotten out of hand.

881
00:57:36,753 --> 00:57:40,154
It's very tense down here, especially
between your father and Mr. Krupp.

882
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:42,656
Tell them to start getting along.
They're adults.

883
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:46,694
You know how your father gets.
He's not gonna back down.

884
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:49,161
Especially when his pride is hurt.

885
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:52,564
- Honey, please just let us out.
- I can't do that.

886
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:54,803
Well, at least give us some food.

887
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:57,305
Something's gotta bend here.

888
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:00,642
Now, I know these people
are your hostages.

889
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:05,674
But they're also guests in our home,
and we don't treat guests this way.

890
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,982
So why don't you make a meatloaf?

891
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:12,283
There's some turkey in the fridge,
and you can use Aunt Mary's recipe.

892
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:13,650
Yeah, I know, Mom.

893
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:17,222
I've made meatloaf and lasagna,
pot roast.

894
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:20,763
You don't have to leave notes for me,
or hide them in my lunch,

895
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,794
laminate lists for me.

896
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:25,334
I'm not a kid anymore.

897
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:27,697
I know.

898
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:35,109
Here they are.

899
00:58:35,578 --> 00:58:36,738
Thanks.

900
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:41,981
- Ned, Ned.
- Yes?

901
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:45,919
Do you think Krupp is right?
Do you think we're bad parents?

902
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:48,257
I think Krupp is an idiot.

903
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:51,049
No, I don't think
we've been bad parents.

904
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:53,123
I think you've done a great job.

905
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,832
- Listen. We found the chute.
- Great.

906
00:58:57,433 --> 00:59:00,266
Okay. I think the kids are gonna be
distracted cooking for a while, let's go.

907
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,565
- All right. We gotta organize. Louise?
- What?

908
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:04,333
- Could you watch the stairs?
- Where?

909
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,805
- At the top of the stairs.
- Okay.

910
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:09,436
Cindy, could you find something sharp
to dig with over there?

911
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:12,107
Incoming!

912
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:15,209
Sleeping bags? Thanks.

913
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:19,482
- Gwenna, sleeping bags.
- Sleeping bags!

914
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:21,413
I got something!

915
00:59:22,926 --> 00:59:25,759
You can hit the thing,
even if it's really hard.

916
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:27,830
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

917
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:29,424
Where? Where? Where?

918
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:31,898
- Straight up.
- Straight up?

919
00:59:32,335 --> 00:59:35,827
<i>Mine eyes have seen the glory</i>
<i>of the coming of the Lord</i>

920
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:37,167
Louder, louder!

921
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:46,676
Forks on the left,
knife and spoon on the right.

922
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:49,843
Well, our silverware usually comes
wrapped in plastic.

923
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:52,552
Doesn't your mom cook?

924
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:55,653
- She can defrost it.
- Or have it delivered.

925
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:59,394
Actually, guys, the glasses go on the...

926
01:00:00,296 --> 01:00:04,733
Wait a minute. Who's gonna say
anything if we change things around?

927
01:00:05,735 --> 01:00:07,635
"Obi-Wan has taught you well."

928
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:44,289
Well, shall we?

929
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,770
Here we are.

930
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:03,018
This is unbelievable.

931
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,813
Yeah. This is really nice.

932
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:07,887
I still can't believe you're here.

933
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:10,823
Why not?

934
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:14,818
Because, you know,
you're Brooke Figler.

935
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:19,735
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Gorgeous, popular, legendary.

936
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:21,767
And what are you?

937
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:26,140
Invisible.

938
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:31,411
Everyone's invisible to the Ice Queen.
She has her image to uphold.

939
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:33,181
How would you know?

940
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:36,841
In eighth grade,
I sat behind you for a whole year.

941
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:40,721
I felt the chill.

942
01:02:41,057 --> 01:02:42,854
You never even came to class.

943
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:45,126
Did I strike a nerve?

944
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:47,696
Come on, you guys,
you're acting like them.

945
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,535
She's right. I'm sorry.

946
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:55,764
Yeah. Me, too.

947
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:00,998
You know, they could learn from us,
I mean, if we could get along.

948
01:03:01,177 --> 01:03:04,305
That's one thing all of us have
in common. Our parents are nuts.

949
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:06,938
If my mom reads one more
New Age self-help book...

950
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:10,444
My mom still labels my sandwiches.

951
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:14,582
What about Matt's dad
with those jokes?

952
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:17,289
- What's wrong with my dad's jokes?
- Yeah. They're funny.

953
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:19,327
We happen to like them.

954
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:25,900
And then there's my parents.

955
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:35,304
When you get old, you get crazy.

956
01:03:35,912 --> 01:03:37,743
I'm not gonna be like that
when I grow up.

957
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:39,007
Me neither.

958
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:45,953
You know, this dinner calls
for a special celebration.

959
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:49,289
And a little music. I'll be right back.

960
01:03:59,135 --> 01:04:00,830
What are you doing? No!

961
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:03,728
What's a little fine dining
without some bubbly?

962
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:07,571
You don't understand! My mom
has been saving that for 14 years!

963
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,145
- She's gonna kill me.
- No wine before your prime.

964
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:11,941
- She'll get over it.
- No!

965
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:14,516
Yes, siree, a little beverage for thee.

966
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:18,511
"To champagne wishes
and caviar dreams."

967
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:25,123
I've always wanted to try this stuff.

968
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:48,210
Your mom should have drank it
while it was still fresh.

969
01:04:53,422 --> 01:04:57,620
So, Ned, why do you have all these
strange decorations down here?

970
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,654
Well, the kids put them up
for our anniversary.

971
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:04,293
Yeah. They wanted to remind us
of our honeymoon in Hawaii.

972
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:06,992
Can you imagine having
a Hawaii honeymoon?

973
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:09,333
That'd be so great. Where did you go?

974
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:12,100
- We didn't have a honeymoon.
- You didn't have a honeymoon?

975
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:15,302
No. Donald was still busy at work,
and I was still waitressing.

976
01:05:15,978 --> 01:05:18,208
- You waitressed?
- Yeah, for five years.

977
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:19,281
Really?

978
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:21,213
You see, Donald and I
were at law school together.

979
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:23,046
He couldn't afford the tuition

980
01:05:23,152 --> 01:05:26,519
so I dropped out and started waitressing
until he got established.

981
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:28,522
- She wanted to.
- I got it!

982
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:30,453
Well?

983
01:05:34,997 --> 01:05:38,160
The latch is broken,
and the door is rusted shut.

984
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:39,700
Get me down.

985
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:44,099
Honey, let's take a little break.

986
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:49,043
A pipe or something that we could hit
at it with.

987
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:57,909
Just hang on a little longer, honey.

988
01:05:58,688 --> 01:06:02,556
When we get out of here, I'm gonna buy
you a whole truckload of cigarettes.

989
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:05,557
- No, it's not that.
- What is it, then?

990
01:06:05,661 --> 01:06:10,530
It just must be nice to have kids who
care about you as much as theirs do.

991
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,701
What are you talking about?
My kids love you.

992
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:15,668
You see, it's your kids.

993
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:18,797
They don't think of me as their mother,
they don't want me as their mother.

994
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:22,400
Well, of course they do. Why do you
think they locked you in here?

995
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:23,739
- Brilliant.
- Brilliant.

996
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:27,482
Brilliant.

997
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:32,109
Absolutely brilliant.

998
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:37,190
- What are you doing?
- Turning off the electricity.

999
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:39,659
Don't you understand?
They can't survive without electricity.

1000
01:06:39,762 --> 01:06:41,161
No Nintendo, no MTV.

1001
01:06:41,263 --> 01:06:43,390
I've already thought of it. It won't work.

1002
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,434
It will work.

1003
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:49,130
Two hours without electricity,
they'll be screaming for their mommy.

1004
01:06:49,238 --> 01:06:51,866
Two hours without electricity
and we're gonna be screaming

1005
01:06:51,974 --> 01:06:54,340
while they burn down the house
with matches.

1006
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:08,981
You don't like this
because it isn't your plan.

1007
01:07:09,091 --> 01:07:11,025
- You are so childish.
- No, I'm not.

1008
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:12,560
Yes, you are.

1009
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:16,256
- Why are you acting this way?
- Why am I acting this way? Why?

1010
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:19,027
I haven't a clue.
Let's take a stab at it, shall we?

1011
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:21,228
I got it! We've been held hostage
since Thursday,

1012
01:07:21,337 --> 01:07:24,238
our kids are starting to act like Freud,
I've probably lost my job,

1013
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:26,331
spurned a fist-fight with the town's
biggest ass-wipe

1014
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:29,809
and we just wasted the entire day
with your stupid plan.

1015
01:07:30,312 --> 01:07:33,475
Turning off the electricity is brilliant,
it's a brilliant plan.

1016
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:36,116
I forgot, you graduated from Mensa,
didn't you?

1017
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:37,947
You and Nostradamus were like this.

1018
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:40,750
It's a bad plan, Ned, a stupid plan.

1019
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:44,725
- What did he just call me?
- "Ass-wipe."

1020
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:51,456
The plumber's wrench
is over by the camera.

1021
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,432
You guys are in big trouble now.

1022
01:07:57,773 --> 01:07:59,206
Who's there?

1023
01:07:59,308 --> 01:08:01,401
Groves, what's going on?

1024
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:07,377
- It's the cops.
- Hide.

1025
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:18,649
Hi.

1026
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:23,394
Can I help you?

1027
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:25,358
We're responding to a complaint.

1028
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:27,333
A neighbor says
your lights keep flashing.

1029
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:32,670
Oh, that. It's the electricity. We've been
having some troubles with it.

1030
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:35,505
- Are your parents at home?
- No, sir.

1031
01:08:36,345 --> 01:08:39,746
Hi, officers. Groves,
we're waiting for you. Come on.

1032
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:42,451
You guys can come, too.

1033
01:08:42,852 --> 01:08:45,116
- You sure?
- Yeah, follow me.

1034
01:08:48,524 --> 01:08:49,855
Come on in.

1035
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:56,658
Hi.

1036
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:58,831
- Wanna play?
- Yeah.

1037
01:09:00,169 --> 01:09:01,466
No, thanks.

1038
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:05,973
The problem's with the fuse box.

1039
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:10,739
The wire came loose from the jamrod,
which caused a short in the connector.

1040
01:09:11,013 --> 01:09:14,540
How are you doing, officers?
I paid those parking tickets.

1041
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:25,024
So, what did you find?

1042
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:29,763
The usual, Chief. Sex, drugs, Twister.

1043
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:33,534
Everything's fine, Chief.
Have a good night.

1044
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,403
Get some rest.

1045
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:45,206
Yes! We did it!

1046
01:09:46,248 --> 01:09:50,981
- How did you keep the parents quiet?
- Ah, my friend, with Matt.

1047
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:57,751
Stay back.
Remember the tomato, okay?

1048
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,521
You are going too far with this.

1049
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:01,460
You're not staying back.

1050
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:03,995
You're not fooling me.

1051
01:10:05,768 --> 01:10:08,464
Got him! He is faking. I knew it.

1052
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,666
Come on, you little wuss.

1053
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:14,836
Stop it!

1054
01:10:19,415 --> 01:10:22,111
- Mr. Krupp.
- How?

1055
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:25,987
Mom, thanks.

1056
01:10:30,593 --> 01:10:32,220
He called me "Mom."

1057
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:35,723
It was our way out of here.
That dumb thing didn't work.

1058
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:38,726
<i>Grover! Grover!</i>

1059
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:41,628
I am ashamed of all of you.

1060
01:10:42,037 --> 01:10:45,632
You ask us to listen to you and trust you
and you're up there drinking?

1061
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:50,476
It was my fault, Mrs. Beindorf.
I opened it, and I only took a little sip.

1062
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:53,847
<i>Only a sip? Well, that's just fine, isn't it?</i>

1063
01:10:54,216 --> 01:10:57,447
<i>What kind of impression are you making</i>
<i>on these younger children?</i>

1064
01:10:58,654 --> 01:11:01,248
- I'm sorry.
- Well, sorry isn't good enough, is it?

1065
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:04,218
Now, I want you all in bed right now!
Do you hear me? Right now!

1066
01:11:04,326 --> 01:11:05,293
Right now!

1067
01:11:06,028 --> 01:11:07,552
<i>You heard the lady, let's go.</i>

1068
01:11:10,566 --> 01:11:11,760
That was good.

1069
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:15,033
<i>Good night.</i>

1070
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:17,462
So, that's how it's done.

1071
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,405
What do we do now?

1072
01:11:19,508 --> 01:11:22,773
If I had a little piece of wire,
my stupid plan would have worked.

1073
01:11:22,878 --> 01:11:26,075
Wire? That's it?
There's wire all over the basement!

1074
01:11:27,182 --> 01:11:30,811
If that's all you want, why not take
a part of Louise's brassiere?

1075
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:33,444
You could wire the whole town.

1076
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:41,856
She's gonna get it.
This is gonna be the time.

1077
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:44,895
- I got her.
- Don't let her go.

1078
01:11:48,037 --> 01:11:51,200
Hook it around the ledge.
Just bend it around really good.

1079
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:52,932
I got it!

1080
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:56,201
What is this?

1081
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:04,141
Take it away from my face!

1082
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:06,254
Grover.

1083
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:08,880
Quick, come here.

1084
01:12:12,194 --> 01:12:14,162
First window on the right.

1085
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:18,466
That dude can have us put away, man.

1086
01:12:18,701 --> 01:12:20,100
But we're minors.

1087
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:40,544
I don't think Rocco's smart enough
to get us put away.

1088
01:12:40,656 --> 01:12:42,624
Yeah, but what if he does?
I mean, what if we end up in jail?

1089
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:44,249
What would our parents do to us?

1090
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,056
What would the other prisoners
do to us?

1091
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:54,936
- They could be outside the house.
- We could be surrounded.

1092
01:13:01,577 --> 01:13:02,874
Did you hear something?

1093
01:13:04,913 --> 01:13:07,677
- They're inside the house.
- They're in the wall.

1094
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:20,018
Wait!

1095
01:13:21,597 --> 01:13:22,791
It's Mom.

1096
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:29,196
Hi, kids. Do you think you could maybe
just give me a little hand here?

1097
01:13:29,304 --> 01:13:30,464
Thanks.

1098
01:13:39,748 --> 01:13:40,715
Look out!

1099
01:13:43,285 --> 01:13:44,775
I got you.

1100
01:13:48,123 --> 01:13:49,886
- What happened?
- Why were you screaming?

1101
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:51,550
What's so funny?

1102
01:13:53,162 --> 01:13:57,496
The only thing you ever finished in
this house was closing off our escape.

1103
01:13:57,599 --> 01:13:59,533
What do you mean, our escape?

1104
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:02,464
What do you mean?
This is our only means of escape?

1105
01:14:02,571 --> 01:14:04,937
- Are you all right?
- I ripped my pants.

1106
01:14:07,476 --> 01:14:11,037
There's always champagne.
What do you say?

1107
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,104
Why not?

1108
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:19,983
- We gotta board this up.
- Yeah.

1109
01:14:26,195 --> 01:14:27,753
What is this?

1110
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:32,991
That was something that Ned gave me
for Valentine's Day. It just wasn't me.

1111
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:36,832
I know. When you become a mom, you
don't get to wear stuff like this anymore.

1112
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:39,271
I'd roll over and die if I believed that.

1113
01:14:39,374 --> 01:14:40,932
- Cake?
- No, thanks.

1114
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:44,806
- Do you want some champagne?
- No, thank you.

1115
01:14:44,913 --> 01:14:48,713
I prefer not to indulge
in artificial stimulants of any kind.

1116
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:52,549
You are of age to drink, right?
21 at least?

1117
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:54,144
What do you mean by that?

1118
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:58,522
I think what he's trying to say is,
judging from the way you talk and dress

1119
01:14:58,627 --> 01:15:00,322
- I'd say you're about 15.
- Excuse me.

1120
01:15:00,429 --> 01:15:05,162
Excuse me, I don't really think the way I
talk and dress is any business of yours.

1121
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:07,360
You know, a lot of people
don't dress their age.

1122
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:08,959
Phil Donahue did a whole show...

1123
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:11,266
Gwenna, no one wants to hear
about Phil Donahue right now.

1124
01:15:11,373 --> 01:15:13,967
Why are you always interrupting her
all the time?

1125
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:16,038
How would like it
if somebody interrupted you

1126
01:15:16,144 --> 01:15:17,634
every time you started to talk?

1127
01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:18,770
Like I said...

1128
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:21,748
- I don't think you respect her very much.
- Respect?

1129
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:24,478
She's my wife.
Of course I respect her, for God's sake.

1130
01:15:24,987 --> 01:15:27,080
- Actually, Donald, you do...
- Gwenna, I'm talking.

1131
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:29,350
You're a fine one to talk about respect,
with you and your kid.

1132
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:32,484
Think your daughter respects you,
you dress like you're 12?

1133
01:15:37,866 --> 01:15:39,561
Not bad. Excuse me.

1134
01:15:45,807 --> 01:15:48,071
- How about a toast?
- To what?

1135
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:52,010
How about to a night

1136
01:15:52,114 --> 01:15:55,481
all alone, without our kids.

1137
01:15:58,420 --> 01:15:59,751
Sorry, John.

1138
01:16:03,425 --> 01:16:06,622
- Ned, do you play that thing?
- No.

1139
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:09,697
Come on, Ned, one song.

1140
01:16:17,806 --> 01:16:20,036
I'm sorry I made fun of you,
really, honey.

1141
01:16:20,809 --> 01:16:23,539
Come on. You play, I'll hula.

1142
01:16:24,346 --> 01:16:28,339
- How do you know how to do a hula?
- I learned it on our honeymoon.

1143
01:16:33,655 --> 01:16:35,213
Go, girl.

1144
01:16:35,524 --> 01:16:39,221
Hey, handsome.
Come on, dance with me.

1145
01:16:49,171 --> 01:16:51,867
Come on, Ned. Dance with me, please?

1146
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:53,134
No, I can't.

1147
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:54,936
That's not what I remember.

1148
01:16:55,477 --> 01:16:56,705
Come on.

1149
01:16:57,713 --> 01:17:01,410
- What about music?
- I'll take care of the music.

1150
01:17:06,154 --> 01:17:07,815
- It's a music box.
- Oh, no.

1151
01:17:19,601 --> 01:17:21,762
- I don't remember.
- Yes, you do.

1152
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:24,772
Hips.

1153
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:49,063
It's a shame
these other people are here.

1154
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:50,153
What people?

1155
01:17:50,265 --> 01:17:52,165
<i>The night is young</i>

1156
01:17:52,267 --> 01:17:55,794
<i>And so are we</i>

1157
01:18:00,108 --> 01:18:02,042
<i>Dreams come true</i>

1158
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:04,168
<i>Dreams come true</i>

1159
01:18:04,413 --> 01:18:07,576
<i>In Blue Hawaii</i>

1160
01:18:08,483 --> 01:18:11,680
<i>All my dreams will come true</i>

1161
01:18:11,887 --> 01:18:15,789
<i>On this night of nights with you</i>

1162
01:18:43,752 --> 01:18:46,949
- What are you doing up?
- I couldn't sleep.

1163
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:50,086
Me either.

1164
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:54,092
What's going on?

1165
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:57,798
They're dancing.

1166
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:01,732
<i>Lovely you</i>

1167
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:05,999
<i>And Blue Hawaii</i>

1168
01:19:07,175 --> 01:19:10,838
<i>With all this loveliness...</i>

1169
01:19:10,946 --> 01:19:12,413
Let's go to bed.

1170
01:19:13,181 --> 01:19:14,148
Okay.

1171
01:20:18,346 --> 01:20:19,870
Cosmo, go away.

1172
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:40,863
<i>Ladies and gentleman, put your</i>
<i>hands together for the Mr. Tom Jones.</i>

1173
01:20:52,747 --> 01:20:55,079
They're playing our song.

1174
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:08,090
I'm sorry.

1175
01:21:09,598 --> 01:21:11,998
It's okay. I just finished, actually.

1176
01:21:12,567 --> 01:21:15,058
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

1177
01:21:16,838 --> 01:21:18,032
And, Grover.

1178
01:21:19,741 --> 01:21:22,904
Remember last night,
when you said that you were invisible?

1179
01:21:23,812 --> 01:21:24,779
Yeah.

1180
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:29,109
Well, you're wrong.
I've always noticed you, and

1181
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,547
you're not invisible.

1182
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:53,696
I fixed up those traps, but I think
we ought to give them a test.

1183
01:21:54,376 --> 01:21:55,775
I'll get it.

1184
01:21:59,848 --> 01:22:01,782
Hello. Is your mother home?

1185
01:22:02,984 --> 01:22:06,215
Yes, but she's sick.

1186
01:22:06,721 --> 01:22:07,745
We all are.

1187
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:15,254
She's been waiting for this.
Can you tell her it's from Mr. Doyle?

1188
01:22:16,064 --> 01:22:17,725
Okay. Do you work with her at the bank?

1189
01:22:17,832 --> 01:22:19,129
No, I'm her lawyer.

1190
01:22:19,801 --> 01:22:20,768
Thanks.

1191
01:22:41,756 --> 01:22:43,519
- Listen, I just...
- I thought that...

1192
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:44,887
- Go ahead.
- No, go on.

1193
01:22:44,993 --> 01:22:46,255
Well, last night, I...

1194
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:49,391
Could I just have your attention
for just a minute, please?

1195
01:22:49,497 --> 01:22:51,829
Introducing the new Cindy Figler.

1196
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:54,727
Come on.

1197
01:22:56,137 --> 01:22:59,732
From the private basement collection
of Janet Beindorf,

1198
01:23:00,308 --> 01:23:03,607
Cindy is wearing
a beautiful evening gown

1199
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:05,837
of green sequins

1200
01:23:05,947 --> 01:23:09,178
and it's got a green dirndl skirt, as well.

1201
01:23:14,255 --> 01:23:15,722
We're ready.

1202
01:23:17,225 --> 01:23:18,783
All right, everybody.

1203
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:21,352
<i>Let's get down to business.</i>

1204
01:23:23,465 --> 01:23:25,330
<i>Mom? Dad?</i>

1205
01:23:29,771 --> 01:23:31,762
- <i>Your turn.</i>
- Are you all right?

1206
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:35,704
Okay, I'm the one asking the questions
right now, all right?

1207
01:23:37,746 --> 01:23:40,806
What's the first thing
that you noticed about Dad?

1208
01:23:42,617 --> 01:23:43,879
<i>Honestly?</i>

1209
01:23:45,553 --> 01:23:46,815
<i>His car.</i>

1210
01:23:47,455 --> 01:23:49,013
- <i>His car?</i>
- <i>It's true.</i>

1211
01:23:49,124 --> 01:23:52,582
<i>It was a 1972 Olds Cutlass convertible.</i>

1212
01:23:53,461 --> 01:23:57,295
<i>It was dark blue with a V8 engine.</i>
<i>It had no muffler. It was very loud.</i>

1213
01:23:57,399 --> 01:24:00,596
<i>My father hated it,</i>
<i>and of course, I loved it.</i>

1214
01:24:01,069 --> 01:24:04,596
<i>It really was a beauty,</i>
<i>and Ned took great care of it.</i>

1215
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,431
Dad? What did you notice about Mom?

1216
01:24:15,617 --> 01:24:18,552
<i>That she was the most beautiful girl</i>
<i>I had ever seen.</i>

1217
01:24:22,657 --> 01:24:24,124
<i>So, let's cut to the chase.</i>

1218
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,118
What went wrong?

1219
01:24:26,528 --> 01:24:29,656
<i>It's just like we said.</i>
<i>It's not any big thing.</i>

1220
01:24:29,764 --> 01:24:31,698
- <i>It's just a bunch of...</i>
- Little things?

1221
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:34,000
Like you thought you should
get a divorce?

1222
01:24:34,102 --> 01:24:36,969
<i>Honey, we've said</i>
<i>we're not getting a divorce.</i>

1223
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:39,433
<i>Mommy and Daddy</i>
<i>just needed some time.</i>

1224
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:43,068
<i>We thought it would be best</i>
<i>if we separated for just a little while.</i>

1225
01:24:43,445 --> 01:24:45,345
<i>I didn't, actually.</i>

1226
01:24:46,214 --> 01:24:49,081
<i>I mean, you said you were unhappy,</i>
<i>and I said, "Well, if you're unhappy,</i>

1227
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:52,119
- <i>"then maybe we should get..."</i>
- <i>Ned, you did say so.</i>

1228
01:24:52,821 --> 01:24:55,688
<i>No, I wasn't happy, but I didn't say...</i>

1229
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:57,451
<i>Ned, I remember you saying it.</i>

1230
01:24:57,559 --> 01:25:00,494
<i>You don't really talk all that much, so I</i>
<i>would remember that you would say it.</i>

1231
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:04,623
Why does everything have to
turn into a fight with you guys?

1232
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:07,259
No wonder you're getting divorced.

1233
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:12,737
<i>Son, again, no one is saying anything</i>
<i>about divorce.</i>

1234
01:25:12,907 --> 01:25:15,068
No one is talking about divorce.

1235
01:25:19,614 --> 01:25:21,343
Then who sent the divorce papers?

1236
01:25:26,421 --> 01:25:28,855
Who turned off the answering machine?

1237
01:25:33,695 --> 01:25:36,129
I want to see those papers. Matt!

1238
01:25:36,865 --> 01:25:39,959
- <i>Hey, Matt, are you still up there?</i>
- Right here, Mr. Beindorf.

1239
01:25:40,335 --> 01:25:41,302
<i>Matt.</i>

1240
01:25:41,703 --> 01:25:45,230
<i>Matt, bring the papers up</i>
<i>for me to see. Now!</i>

1241
01:25:50,211 --> 01:25:52,805
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, it's Ralph Doyle.</i>

1242
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:55,844
- What do you want?
- <i>I want to talk to your mother.</i>

1243
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:59,442
- I thought I told you that she's sick.
- <i>Did you give her that...</i>

1244
01:25:59,554 --> 01:26:02,824
You mean the divorce papers?
She got them, she was just thrilled.

1245
01:26:02,957 --> 01:26:06,893
- What happened to trial separation?
- Just listen to me, please. You never...

1246
01:26:07,061 --> 01:26:11,020
- It's getting a little ugly down here, man.
- Can't you tell we're having a party?

1247
01:26:11,132 --> 01:26:13,396
Whoopee!

1248
01:26:14,335 --> 01:26:16,098
<i>I'm sure she must have</i>
<i>some questions.</i>

1249
01:26:16,204 --> 01:26:18,399
Oh, yeah? Well, so do I!

1250
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:23,273
We're supposed to be saving
marriages, not breaking them up.

1251
01:27:20,268 --> 01:27:21,701
What happened?

1252
01:27:23,371 --> 01:27:28,035
Things just aren't going
exactly the way we planned.

1253
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:43,447
- Ned.
- What?

1254
01:27:44,459 --> 01:27:46,017
Come on, I'm sorry.

1255
01:27:46,127 --> 01:27:48,925
About what? You purposely
deceiving me? I don't think so.

1256
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:52,056
I went to this lawyer just for advice.

1257
01:27:52,166 --> 01:27:56,398
He said anybody who separates,
they usually draw up divorce papers.

1258
01:27:56,504 --> 01:27:58,199
He said you were probably doing
the same thing.

1259
01:27:58,306 --> 01:27:59,295
Well, I wasn't.

1260
01:27:59,407 --> 01:28:02,865
- And if I were, I would've told you.
- Come on, Ned, just talk to me.

1261
01:28:03,544 --> 01:28:06,069
Talk to my attorney, Donald.

1262
01:28:10,585 --> 01:28:13,418
I'll get you the house.
The kids may be a problem.

1263
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:13,270
Yes! That's it!

1264
01:29:17,552 --> 01:29:19,543
- We're through!
- Oh, my God!

1265
01:29:23,991 --> 01:29:26,755
Yeah, but who are you going to get
to fit through there?

1266
01:29:33,101 --> 01:29:35,968
- They're trying to escape!
- It'll be okay.

1267
01:29:36,237 --> 01:29:38,933
Groves is going to be pissed!
He'll be back any second.

1268
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:40,401
Get in there!

1269
01:29:44,912 --> 01:29:46,038
Making progress.

1270
01:29:46,447 --> 01:29:47,709
I made it!

1271
01:29:51,519 --> 01:29:55,114
- I'm stuck!
- Hang in. Hang in, honey, hang in.

1272
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:56,986
- Yes, you can do it!
- Louise.

1273
01:29:57,492 --> 01:29:59,619
- Help!
- Be careful!

1274
01:30:00,027 --> 01:30:00,994
Help!

1275
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:14,405
Look out for the trip wire!

1276
01:30:16,177 --> 01:30:17,235
Don't do that!

1277
01:30:17,712 --> 01:30:19,441
Help me, come on!

1278
01:30:23,885 --> 01:30:26,615
Matt, Jimmy, Teddy, come here!

1279
01:30:35,863 --> 01:30:38,491
You can't push and pull
at the same time!

1280
01:30:42,336 --> 01:30:43,360
Grover?

1281
01:30:49,243 --> 01:30:50,210
Wait!

1282
01:30:51,112 --> 01:30:53,774
Groves, where have you been, man?

1283
01:30:53,981 --> 01:30:56,814
Hey, what about me?

1284
01:30:58,920 --> 01:30:59,887
Later!

1285
01:31:01,022 --> 01:31:05,618
Operator? This is Chief Rocco.
Get me the police.

1286
01:31:12,633 --> 01:31:13,622
Grover!

1287
01:31:16,204 --> 01:31:20,868
Nothing's wrong, huh?
Well, what about this?

1288
01:31:26,914 --> 01:31:27,881
Hello.

1289
01:31:29,717 --> 01:31:32,208
This is Officers Davis and Brickowski.

1290
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:33,917
All right, now.

1291
01:31:34,021 --> 01:31:37,980
- Don't you worry about anything.
- Something strange is going on here.

1292
01:31:41,362 --> 01:31:43,728
Hey! Did you see that?

1293
01:31:44,031 --> 01:31:46,829
Hey, Dave! What happened to you?

1294
01:31:50,071 --> 01:31:52,665
Did you see that?
How did those kids do that?

1295
01:31:53,407 --> 01:31:55,034
Mayday!

1296
01:31:55,142 --> 01:31:57,303
You wait right here. Don't go away.

1297
01:31:57,478 --> 01:31:59,537
- I'm gonna get help.
- But...

1298
01:32:00,481 --> 01:32:02,176
- Chief!
- Chief Rocco!

1299
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:07,478
Help!

1300
01:32:11,259 --> 01:32:13,625
Grover, come on, open the door.

1301
01:32:14,428 --> 01:32:15,395
Please?

1302
01:32:25,573 --> 01:32:26,870
Come on in.

1303
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:39,481
How are you doing?

1304
01:32:40,521 --> 01:32:41,488
Bad.

1305
01:32:42,323 --> 01:32:43,722
Same here.

1306
01:32:54,035 --> 01:32:55,832
- It's over.
- What do you mean?

1307
01:32:57,805 --> 01:32:59,739
I mean, we failed.

1308
01:33:02,510 --> 01:33:06,606
Our parents aren't going to change
just because we want them to.

1309
01:33:09,216 --> 01:33:10,649
What we did was wrong.

1310
01:33:11,352 --> 01:33:13,877
Wrong and stupid.

1311
01:33:17,258 --> 01:33:18,987
It's time to let them out, guys.

1312
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:21,224
No, wait a minute!

1313
01:33:24,732 --> 01:33:27,166
Look, it wasn't stupid at all.

1314
01:33:28,603 --> 01:33:31,436
So, maybe we can't fix everything,
you know, but,

1315
01:33:31,872 --> 01:33:32,964
who can?

1316
01:33:34,642 --> 01:33:36,234
But at least we tried, right?

1317
01:33:39,146 --> 01:33:43,913
I don't know if your parents will separate
or divorce or live happily ever after,

1318
01:33:45,353 --> 01:33:46,980
but we didn't fail.

1319
01:33:47,922 --> 01:33:49,412
I mean, at least they know how we feel.

1320
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:52,516
She's right, Groves.

1321
01:33:53,327 --> 01:33:56,057
Who'd have thought we'd all be friends,
you know?

1322
01:33:56,664 --> 01:33:59,098
Hey, who says we're friends?

1323
01:34:03,371 --> 01:34:05,362
We're more like a family.

1324
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:25,789
You guys, group hug, group hug!

1325
01:34:27,728 --> 01:34:29,559
God, I love you all so much!

1326
01:34:33,467 --> 01:34:34,798
I love you!

1327
01:34:45,212 --> 01:34:49,171
<i>The house is completely surrounded!</i>
<i>Come out with your hands up!</i>

1328
01:34:49,316 --> 01:34:51,614
- What's going on?
- Oh, no.

1329
01:34:52,887 --> 01:34:54,149
- The cops!
- The cops?

1330
01:34:57,725 --> 01:35:00,193
Hey! Mayday!

1331
01:35:00,528 --> 01:35:03,156
<i>The house is surrounded.</i>
<i>Come out with your hands up.</i>

1332
01:35:03,264 --> 01:35:05,095
Fellas? Excuse me?

1333
01:35:05,733 --> 01:35:07,394
Did you hear that? We're free.

1334
01:35:07,568 --> 01:35:09,092
- Who is that?
- We're free!

1335
01:35:09,236 --> 01:35:10,601
We're free?

1336
01:35:12,273 --> 01:35:15,242
We're free!
I can't believe that we're free!

1337
01:35:17,511 --> 01:35:19,911
Come on! Let's go.

1338
01:35:22,616 --> 01:35:23,583
Gwenna.

1339
01:35:24,618 --> 01:35:26,518
I forgive you. Come on.

1340
01:35:41,235 --> 01:35:42,202
Come on.

1341
01:35:45,406 --> 01:35:48,000
I'm sure that it's not over yet for you.

1342
01:35:48,109 --> 01:35:50,043
I knew you two still loved each other

1343
01:35:50,144 --> 01:35:51,975
when you were fighting
over the fuse box.

1344
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:53,444
You have so much passion.

1345
01:35:53,547 --> 01:35:55,674
Yeah, don't ever lose that, honey, okay?

1346
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:58,845
Move it, rookie.

1347
01:35:58,953 --> 01:36:00,921
Keep the house covered!

1348
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:10,462
<i>I repeat. Put down your weapons,</i>
<i>and come out with your hands up.</i>

1349
01:36:10,798 --> 01:36:13,562
<i>The house is completely surrounded.</i>

1350
01:36:16,403 --> 01:36:18,394
Prepare to enter, boys.

1351
01:36:18,672 --> 01:36:20,503
<i>You have five seconds.</i>

1352
01:36:20,674 --> 01:36:21,641
<i>One.</i>

1353
01:36:22,543 --> 01:36:23,510
<i>Two.</i>

1354
01:36:23,944 --> 01:36:24,911
<i>Three.</i>

1355
01:36:26,514 --> 01:36:28,607
Movement at the door!

1356
01:36:46,634 --> 01:36:48,534
Our parents are locked in the...

1357
01:36:51,972 --> 01:36:54,702
Our parents are locked in the basement.

1358
01:36:57,645 --> 01:36:58,612
And

1359
01:36:59,213 --> 01:37:02,114
Mr. Finley is stuck
in one of the windows.

1360
01:37:03,884 --> 01:37:08,480
We are prepared to surrender!

1361
01:37:18,432 --> 01:37:19,763
Let's go!

1362
01:37:20,601 --> 01:37:22,159
Let's go, go, go!

1363
01:37:22,636 --> 01:37:23,762
Move!

1364
01:37:27,107 --> 01:37:29,234
Come on, move!
Come on. Let's go. Move.

1365
01:37:31,645 --> 01:37:34,409
- We're in here!
- Help us!

1366
01:37:34,515 --> 01:37:36,039
In here!

1367
01:37:36,650 --> 01:37:38,982
Behind the blanket, you idiots.
Come on!

1368
01:37:44,124 --> 01:37:45,921
- Look at this!
- It's some kind of cult!

1369
01:37:46,227 --> 01:37:48,024
Officer, my husband's in the wall.

1370
01:39:23,724 --> 01:39:26,420
Does anybody have a cigarette
for my friend here?

1371
01:39:27,361 --> 01:39:29,090
Forget it, I quit.

1372
01:39:29,797 --> 01:39:32,994
Sir, sir, sir, could you help me?
My husband is in the wall.

1373
01:39:41,642 --> 01:39:44,167
You're in very big trouble.
You know that, don't you?

1374
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:45,946
Ned?

1375
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:49,178
We're going to have to get
a statement from your daughter.

1376
01:39:49,316 --> 01:39:52,649
- I'll be there in a minute.
- Ned? We have to talk.

1377
01:39:53,954 --> 01:39:56,388
- I don't...
- Don't talk. Look.

1378
01:39:57,591 --> 01:39:58,717
Just look!

1379
01:39:59,093 --> 01:40:01,789
Look at what Grover's done for us.

1380
01:40:02,763 --> 01:40:05,960
Not this. Just everything else.

1381
01:40:07,434 --> 01:40:10,767
I know we made mistakes, Ned.
I made most of them.

1382
01:40:11,839 --> 01:40:15,798
I don't think they would have done any of
this if we hadn't done something right.

1383
01:40:16,043 --> 01:40:18,534
- But you said...
- But it doesn't matter what I said.

1384
01:40:19,446 --> 01:40:20,413
Ned.

1385
01:40:22,750 --> 01:40:25,048
You love me very much.

1386
01:40:29,823 --> 01:40:31,484
And you love me, too.

1387
01:40:43,871 --> 01:40:46,533
Hold on a second, Ma. Grover!

1388
01:40:48,509 --> 01:40:51,239
- Grover.
- Grover.

1389
01:40:51,812 --> 01:40:54,212
Anything you say can...

1390
01:40:55,182 --> 01:40:58,015
You've also the right to remain silent.
Anything you say...

1391
01:40:58,552 --> 01:41:00,645
- Excuse me?
- All right!

1392
01:41:02,322 --> 01:41:04,552
Oh, my God! They're kissing!

1393
01:41:28,549 --> 01:41:30,608
- Let's go bail out our boy.
- Okay.

1394
01:41:31,652 --> 01:41:33,119
I'm stuck!

1395
01:41:45,199 --> 01:41:49,033
Excuse me, miss.
Son, do you understand these rights...

1396
01:41:49,203 --> 01:41:52,366
Grover! Do you have any idea...

1397
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:01,645
Excuse me!

1398
01:42:02,082 --> 01:42:03,276
Excuse me.

1399
01:42:04,384 --> 01:42:06,682
Hello? Anybody?

1400
01:42:06,787 --> 01:42:09,984
We were charged with kidnapping,
civil disobedience

1401
01:42:10,324 --> 01:42:13,259
and practicing psychotherapy
without a license.

1402
01:42:14,027 --> 01:42:18,657
<i>We all spent a night in juvenile hall,</i>
<i>but then Mr. Krupp came and got us out.</i>

1403
01:42:19,399 --> 01:42:23,301
<i>Mrs. Krupp said she'd take him</i>
<i>for everything he had if he didn't.</i>

1404
01:42:23,770 --> 01:42:26,705
<i>They later got divorced.</i>

1405
01:42:27,307 --> 01:42:29,571
<i>Mrs. Krupp went back</i>
<i>to law school, though.</i>

1406
01:42:30,344 --> 01:42:34,781
<i>They started up their own law practice,</i>
<i>Krupp & Krupp, attorneys at law.</i>

1407
01:42:36,049 --> 01:42:40,110
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Finley are doing great.</i>
<i>They even passed the two-year mark.</i>

1408
01:42:40,387 --> 01:42:43,720
<i>And Mrs. Finley is expecting</i>
<i>a new member of the family.</i>

1409
01:42:44,291 --> 01:42:46,782
<i>Mrs. Figler stopped going out</i>
<i>on Brooke's dates</i>

1410
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:48,925
<i>and started going out on her own.</i>

1411
01:42:52,666 --> 01:42:55,226
<i>All of us kids still pretty much</i>
<i>hang out together</i>

1412
01:42:55,435 --> 01:42:59,531
<i>and things pretty much</i>
<i>got back to normal.</i>

1413
01:43:01,975 --> 01:43:05,035
<i>Well, not quite normal.</i>

1414
01:43:19,826 --> 01:43:22,624
<i>And Brooke and I are also</i>
<i>kind of dating right now.</i>

1415
01:43:23,263 --> 01:43:26,130
<i>It's weird, but great.</i>

1416
01:43:33,707 --> 01:43:35,675
All right, Grover rules!

1417
01:43:36,443 --> 01:43:40,812
Mom and Dad found a good shrink,
and they're still together.

1418
01:43:41,381 --> 01:43:45,681
In fact, right now, me and Stacy are
with them on their second honeymoon

1419
01:43:45,886 --> 01:43:47,217
in Hawaii.

1420
01:43:47,688 --> 01:43:50,350
- Stacy, can you zoom in on that kiss?
- Sure!

1421
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:55,620
Hang on a second, I almost forgot.

1422
01:43:55,963 --> 01:43:59,831
Mom and Dad made us promise never
to lock them in the basement again.

1423
01:44:00,667 --> 01:44:04,728
We promised. Because we figured
there's always the attic.

1424
01:44:05,939 --> 01:44:06,906
Come on!

1425
01:44:08,942 --> 01:44:11,877
Come on, let's go to the beach
before it's too late.

1426
01:44:12,012 --> 01:44:14,139
Tomorrow, the first thing we should do
is go windsurfing

1427
01:44:14,248 --> 01:44:16,239
and then go scuba diving.

1428
01:44:16,350 --> 01:44:19,581
- All right, should I stop making plans?
- I think so!
