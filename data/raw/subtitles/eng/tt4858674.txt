<i>I ever saw her.</i>

6
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:34,595
<i>But before we talk about her,</i>
<i>I have to tell you something about me.</i>

7
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,847
<i>And I'm sorry I have to tell you,</i>
<i>but I do.</i>

9
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,812
<i>I know it's sad, but it's true,</i>
<i>and it happened.</i>

10
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:46,857
<i>And it's something</i>
<i>you need to know about me.</i>

11
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,527
<i>But here's the good news.</i>
<i>When he was alive, he was the best.</i>

12
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,988
<i>He was funny and silly and...</i>

13
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,992
<i>He had this amazing porcupine tie</i>
<i>he used to wear all the time.</i>

14
00:01:57,576 --> 00:02:00,954
<i>And when he died,</i>
<i>my mom let me wear it to his funeral.</i>

15
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:05,500
<i>And after that,</i>
<i>I wore it pretty much every day.</i>

16
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,879
<i>Fighting dinosaurs? Tie.</i>

17

20

21
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,272

22
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:32,110

<i>and that it was quiet and far away.</i>

23

<i>She said we could start fresh.</i>
<i>Just the two of us.</i>

24
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,216
<i>But guess what?</i>

25
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,885
<i>Mica was quieter</i>
<i>than I ever could've imagined.</i>

26
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,887
<i>Nothing ever happened here.</i>

27
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:00,889

28

<i>no celebrations, no stories.</i>

32
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,240
<i>Because it had been that way for so long,</i>
<i>it just felt normal.</i>

33
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:22,452
<i>And as the new kid, that meant I became</i>
<i>the center of attention real fast.</i>

34
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,879
<i>And not in a good way.</i>

35
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,093
<i>And right then, I knew.</i>

36
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:41,388

Maybe.

You finally found me out.

No.

KEVIN: Imagine being popular
for doing absolutely nothing.

79
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,912
They're popular because they're beautiful.

80
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,497
Yeah, Tess, that's not something you do.

Something tastes different.

82
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,961

<i>Oh, my Lord please</i>

1187
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:31,370
<i>Take hold of my hand</i>

1188
01:38:31,453 --> 01:38:35,999
<i>And I might understand you</i>

1189
01:38:36,083 --> 01:38:40,045
<i>Won't you please</i>
<i>Oh, won't you?</i>

1190
01:38:58,939 --> 01:39:04,903
<i>Don't say maybe</i>
<i>Just await me</i>

1191
01:39:04,987 --> 01:39:08,156
<i>We can stay here</i>

1192
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:14,121
<i>For as long as we want</i>

1193
01:39:14,204 --> 01:39:17,833
<i>Make forever last a while</i>

1194
01:39:23,046 --> 01:39:26,508
<i>Leave the light on</i>

1195
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:29,553
<i>After the song</i>

1196
01:39:29,636 --> 01:39:35,517
<i>Leaves and goes to a far off ocean</i>

1197
01:39:35,601 --> 01:39:42,107
<i>Lay here with me</i>

1198
01:39:47,446 --> 01:39:51,658
<i>And I'll catch you</i>

1199
01:39:52,492 --> 01:39:58,582
<i>Falling into me</i>
<i>Falling into you</i>

1200
01:39:58,665 --> 01:40:04,421
<i>Letting go of all the things</i>
<i>I thought were true</i>

1201
01:40:04,505 --> 01:40:10,636
<i>Falling into me</i>
<i>as I'm falling into you</i>

1202
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:17,100
<i>It seems so clear</i>
<i>that I don't know what to do</i>

1203
01:40:21,563 --> 01:40:27,694
<i>I speak too much</i>
<i>You stay closed off</i>

1204
01:40:27,778 --> 01:40:30,697
<i>But I can see</i>

1205
01:40:30,781 --> 01:40:36,036
<i>Your thoughts in the stardust</i>

1206
01:40:36,912 --> 01:40:40,457
<i>Shining back at me</i>

1207
01:40:45,420 --> 01:40:49,383
<i>As I catch you</i>

1208
01:40:50,509 --> 01:40:56,598
<i>Falling into me</i>
<i>Falling into you</i>

1209
01:40:56,682 --> 01:41:02,646
<i>Letting go of all the things</i>
<i>I thought were true</i>

1210
01:41:02,729 --> 01:41:08,652
<i>Falling into me as I'm falling into you</i>

1211
01:41:08,735 --> 01:41:14,074
<i>It seems so clear</i>
<i>that I don't know what to do</i>

1212
01:41:44,229 --> 01:41:50,360
<i>One day I'll be old and ugly</i>

1213
01:41:50,444 --> 01:41:56,450
<i>Will you still be thinking of me?</i>

1214
01:41:56,533 --> 01:42:03,207
<i>If we were as brave as we are now</i>

1215
01:42:08,295 --> 01:42:13,175
<i>And I'll catch you</i>

1216
01:42:13,258 --> 01:42:19,223
<i>Thinking of me as I'm thinking of you</i>

1217
01:42:19,306 --> 01:42:24,686
<i>Letting go of all the things</i>
<i>I thought were true</i>

1218
01:42:24,770 --> 01:42:31,235
<i>As you're falling into me</i>
<i>I'm falling into you</i>

1219
01:42:31,318 --> 01:42:37,241
<i>It seems so clear</i>
<i>that I don't know what to do</i>

1220
01:42:37,324 --> 01:42:38,825
(VOCALIZING)

1221
01:42:58,053 --> 01:42:59,054
(STOPS PLAYING)

1222
01:43:00,514 --> 01:43:02,516
- That's it.
- (BOTH CHUCKLE)
