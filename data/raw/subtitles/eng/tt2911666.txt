00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,080
<i>MAN: (ON RADIO) It looks
like the storm has passed.</i>

2
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,920
<i>New Yorkers, a season high,
seven inches of rain last night.</i>

3
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,120
<i>High winds and
flooding in some areas</i>

4
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,220
<i>even left some New
Yorkers stranded.</i>

5
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,790
<i>City crews still
working this morning.</i>

6
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,030
<i>They're trying to restore power</i>

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,860
<i>Good news is, today should be
sunny with highs in the low 60s.</i>

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,370
<i>Relentless weather
these past few weeks.</i>

9
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,110
<i>So get out there, enjoy the sun,</i>

10
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,970
<i>go to the park, get
outside if you can,</i>

11
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,540
<i>because it's not
gonna last long.</i>

12
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,910
<i>What are you doing, John?</i>

13
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,050
<i>JOHN: Looking at you.</i>

14
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,550
<i>HELEN: Come here.</i>

15
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,390
<i>HELEN: Are you still filming?</i>

16
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,520
JOHN:  Just an anniversary...

17
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,050
MARCUS: It's been a while.

18
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,050
My condolences.

19
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,050
How're you holdin' up?

20
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,820
I keep asking "Why her?"

21
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,730
There's no rhyme or
reason to this life.

22
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,760
It's days like today
scattered among the rest.

23
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,770
Are you sure?

24
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,470
Don't blame yourself.

25
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,810
What are you really
doing here, Marcus?

26
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,650
Just checkin' up
on an old friend.

27
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,490
Goodbye, John.

28
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,290
John Wick?

29
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,560
Yes.

30
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,860
Sign here, please.

31
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,130
And the pen.

32
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,500
Sorry.

33
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,400
Here you go. Good night.
Thanks.

34
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:08,800
<i>HELEN: "John, I'm sorry
I can't be there for you.</i>

35
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,780
<i>"But you still need
something, someone, to love.</i>

36
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:17,580
<i>"So start with this. Because
the car doesn't count.</i>

37
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,680

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,850

40
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:29,630
<i>"Until that day, your
best friend, Helen."</i>

41
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,860
Hey.

42
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,570
Hey.

43
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,910
Daisy.

44
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,780
Of course.

45
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,820
Hey.

46
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,720
Come on.

47
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,620
I'm up. I'm up...

48
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,050
I'm up. I'm up.

49
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,410
Hey!

50
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,540
Oh.

51
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,910
Right.

52
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,590
What?

53
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,940
We'll grab you
some kibble later.

54
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,700
Nice ride.

55
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,770
Mustang.

56
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:31,970
Boss 429.

57
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,740
She a '70?

58
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,210
'69.

59
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,810
Huh.

60
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,640
Beautiful car.

61
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,710
Thanks.

62
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,850
How much?

63
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,620
Excuse me?

64
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,980
How much for the car?

65
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,590
She's not for sale.

66
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,790
Oh, I love dogs.

67
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,840
You have good day, sir.

68
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,630
All right, come on, then.

69
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,240
How you doin'?

70
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,980
You need to go?

71
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,030
Uh-huh.

72
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,420
Yo, Aurelio!

73
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,920
Ah?

74
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,490
I want a new VIN number
and some clean papers.

75
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,530
Where'd you get that car?

76
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,510
Is it here?

77
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,930
It was.

78
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,540
I asked you where the
hell did you get it?

79
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,470
<i>AURELIO:  Iosef
Tarasov nicked it.</i>

80
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,570
Viggo's son.

81
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,310
Yeah.

82
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:22,440
All right, get out of here. Just get
out of my shop. Get out right now.

83
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,110
Did you just lose
your shit, Aurelio?

84
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,520
Because we own you.

85
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,190
What did you say? What
did you say to me?

86
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,560
We own you.

87
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,990
You don't own me, punk.

88
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,900
I work with your
father, all right?

89
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,270
The owner of that car,
did you kill him or what?

90
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,940
No.

91
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,340
I sure as hell fucked up his dog.
(LAUGHS)

92
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,540
You fucked up his dog?
That's what you did?

93
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,040
You fucked up his dog?

94
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,380
Yeah...

95
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,210
That's crazy shit, man.

96
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,520
Aw, look at you. That's great.

97
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,090
You're gonna come into my shop and
you're gonna pull a gun on me.

98
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,420
Ah, that's great, man. Come on!

99
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,030
Now, either you
kill me right now

100
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,360
or you get the
fuck outta my shop!

101
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,030
Viggo is not gonna like this.

102
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,000
How do you know what Viggo
likes or doesn't like?

103
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,850
I'll tell you somethin'
he's gonna understand.

104
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,110
You've got a fuckin'
pair on you, old man!

105
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,620
I guess we'll be takin' our
business someplace else.

106
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,990
<i>AURELIO: So what
are you gonna do?</i>

107
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,700
(EXHALES)

108
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,970
I need a ride.

109
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,950
Aurelio speaking.

110
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,420
VIGGO: I heard you
struck my son.

111
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:16,960
<i>AURELIO: Yes sir, I did.</i>

112
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,660
And may I ask why?

113
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,260
Yeah. Well, because he
stole John Wick's car, sir.

114
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,500
And, uh, killed his dog.

115
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,740
Oh.

116
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,170
Viggo?

117
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,610
Yeah?

118
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:07,240
They've agreed to your terms.

119
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,480
I mean, it's not like
you gave them much

120
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,410
of a choice anyway,
though, right?

121
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,580
Congratulations.

122
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,350
Sir?

123
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,430
Have you seen my son?

124
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,180
How was your trip, kid?

125
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,510
We won't be hearing
from them anytime soon.

126
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,080
Or ever.

127
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,680
That's a nice jacket.

128
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,680
Thanks. Yeah.

129
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,520
Should I go?

130
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,360
Viggo, English, please.
Come on...

131
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,460
Stay, God damn it!

132
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,990
IOSEF: What did I do?

133
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,370
IOSEF: We did what you asked.

134
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,270
No one saw shit.

135
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,270
(GRUNTS)

136
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,610
I'm not talking
about Atlantic City.

137
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,750
(SWALLOWS)

138
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,680
What, then?

139
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,820
You mean Aurelio's? So
I stole a fucking car!

140
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,390
Aw, fuck, Viggo!

141
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,620
Right, I'll go... You stay!

142
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:23,610
It's not what you did,
son, that angers me so.

143
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,610
It's who you did it to.

144
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,180
Who? The fucking nobody!

145
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,750
That fuckin' nobody

146
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,320
is John Wick.

147
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,910
<i>He once was an
associate of ours.</i>

148
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,310
They call him Baba Yaga.

149
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,180
The Boogeyman?

150
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,920
Well, John wasn't
exactly The Boogeyman.

151
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,960
He was the one you sent to
kill the fucking Boogeyman.

152
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,770
Oh.

153
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:20,340
VIGGO: John is a man of focus,

154
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:22,570
commitment,

155
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,710
sheer will.

156
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,740
Something you know
very little about.

157
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:33,380
I once saw him kill
three men in a bar.

158
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,680
With a pencil.

159
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,520
With a fuckin'...

160
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,920
pencil.

161
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:54,000
Then suddenly one day
he asked to leave.

162
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,640
It's over a woman, of course.

163
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,480
<i>So I made a deal with him.</i>

164
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,590
I gave him an impossible task.

165
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:14,960
A job no one could
have pulled off.

166
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,970
The bodies he buried that day

167
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,000
laid the foundation
of what we are now.

168
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:34,510
And then, my son,

169
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,980
a few days after his wife died,

170
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,720
you steal his car

171
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,450
and kill his fuckin' dog.

172
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,760
Father, I can make this right.

173
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,860
Oh...

174
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,830
How do you plan that?

175
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,890
By finishing what I started.

176
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,500
What the... Did he hear a fucking
word I said? (SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

177
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,630
Iosef! Iosef! Listen!

178
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,040
Huh?

179
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,970
John will come for you.

180
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,750
<i>And you will do nothing,</i>

181
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,820
because you can do nothing.

182
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,350
So get the fuck out of my sight!

183
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,880
<i>VIGGO: Hello, John.</i>

184
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,590
I heard about your
wife, and I'm sorry.

185
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,690
My condolences.

186
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:01,960
<i>It seems to be fate,
or happenstance</i>

187
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:05,730
<i>or just bad fuckin' luck caused
our paths to cross once again.</i>

188
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,710
John?

189
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:19,680
Let us not resort to
our baser instincts

190
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,680
<i>and handle this like
civilized men, to move on...</i>

191
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,730
AVI: What'd he say?

192
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,800
Enough.

193
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,900
Oh, God.

194
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:46,610
Task your crew.

195
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,940
How many?

196
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,410
How many do you have?

197
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,060
Evenin', John.

198
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,200
Evenin', Jimmy.

199
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,670
Noise complaint?

200
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,300
Noise complaint.

201
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,880
You, uh, workin' again?

202
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,450
No, just sortin' some stuff out.

203
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,690
Ah, well...

204
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,960
I'll leave you be, then.

205
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,100
Good night, John.

206
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,300
Good night, Jimmy.

207
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,720
This is Wick.

208
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,080
Yes, John Wick, that's right.

209
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:58,720
I'd like to make a dinner
reservation for 12.

210
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,070
Good to see you, John.

211
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,110
JOHN: Charlie.

212
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,060
You look good.

213
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:39,260
And here I'd feared you'd
left all this behind.

214
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:23,170
Will I be hearin'
from you anytime soon?

215
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,570
Goodbye, Charlie.

216
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,510
John.

217
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,520
Of course he did.

218
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,820
Put a contract on John Wick.

219
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,390
How much?

220
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:42,490
Two million.

221
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,270
English, Viggo, please.

222
00:34:56,270 --> 00:35:00,010
Put losef in the Red
Circle and wait.

223
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,410
For what?

224
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:05,580
For John Wick, of course.

225
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:32,070
Thank you.

226
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,440
MARCUS: To what do
I owe this visit?

227
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:42,420
I have a job for you.

228
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:45,320
And I've got a phone.

229
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,590
Hmm.

230
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:51,160
I want to offer you
this face to face

231
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,160
seeing as how you might
find it personal.

232
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,030
Would you kill John Wick
for two million dollars?

233
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,340
After all, you were close.

234
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:09,110
Is the contract exclusive?

235
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,910
No, it's open.

236
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:13,080
It's a timely matter, it
has to be handled quickly.

237
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,650
Consider it done.

238
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,650
Thank you, Marcus.

239
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:22,020
I know I can trust you.
Thanks for the drink.

240
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:29,220
CHARON: Room 918.
Do enjoy your stay.

241
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,620
Thanks.

242
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:34,450
Good seeing you again, John.

243
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,490
Perkins.

244
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:41,630
I have you for two nights.

245
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,760
Depending on business,
it may be more.

246
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,430
Of course, sir.

247
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,370
So when did the old
place get a facelift?

248
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,440
Around four years ago.

249
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,440
But I assure you, sir, she
really hasn't changed much.

250
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,640
Same owner?

251
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,210
Same owner.

252
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,520
Room 818.

253
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,160
And, as always,

254
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,800
it is a pleasure having you
with us again, Mr. Wick.

255
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:31,770
<i>HELEN: What are
you doing, John?</i>

256
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,450
<i>JOHN: Looking at you.</i>

257
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,820
<i>Come here.</i>

258
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,550
Hello, Winston.

259
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:15,250
Jonathan.

260
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,620
Now, as I recall,

261
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,690
weren't you the one
tasked to dole out

262
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:23,790
the beatings, not receive them?

263
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,290
Rusty, I guess.

264
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,000
To what do we owe the pleasure?

265
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,600
Iosef Tarasov.

266
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,270
What about him?

267
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:35,470
I'd like to talk with him.

268
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:39,470
A talk, you say.

269
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,550
I'm familiar with the
parlance, Jonathan.

270
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:48,020
I want to ask you this.

271
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,880
Have you returned to the fold?

272
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:53,650
Just visiting.

273
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,760
Have you thought this through?

274
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,560
I mean, chewed down to the bone?

275
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:03,460
You got out once.

276
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,970
You dip so much as a pinky
back into this pond,

277
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:11,310
you may well find
something reaches out

278
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:13,670
and drags you back
into its depths.

279
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,940
Where do I find him?

280
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,850
AVI: Hey.

281
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,480
Wick's at The Continental.

282
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:26,850
Welcome home, John.

283
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:29,300
We have a contact there who's
willing to take him out for us.

284
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,420
Yeah?

285
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:33,290
How brazen.

286
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,400
If they're willing to break
the rules of Continental,

287
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,970
double the bounty.

288
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:42,500
You know the rules.

289
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:44,610
No business can be
conducted on these premises

290
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:48,040
lest incurring heavy penalties.

291
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:52,710
Have a drink

292
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,420
and relax.

293
00:42:58,790 --> 00:42:59,850
For now.

294
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,660
It's personal.

295
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:14,570
Holy shit! Jonathan!

296
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:16,840
Hey, Addy. My God!

297
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,710
How long has it been?
Four years?

298
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,340
Five and change.

299
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:24,780
So tell me, how was
life on the other side?

300
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,780
It was good, Addy.

301
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:28,620
Far better than I deserved.

302
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,720
Hey, I'm sorry to
hear about your...

303
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,820
Thanks.

304
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,720
I've never seen you like this.

305
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:38,790
Like what?

306
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:41,400
Vulnerable.

307
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:45,470
I'm retired.

308
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:47,400
Not if you're drinkin'
here, you're not.

309
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Usual? Please.

310
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:58,850
Compliments of the house.

311
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:01,380
Thanks.

312
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:12,050
Did you see the
tits on that girl?

313
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:17,120
Better hope Lita
is working tonight.

314
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,270
Are you scared of the
fuckin' boogeyman?

315
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:37,070
I'm not.

316
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:40,110
No. But you should be.

317
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,610
I want another bottle!

318
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,850
Right fuckin' now!
Go get me a bottle!

319
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,320
Come on!

320
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,260
Hello, Francis.

321
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:05,790
Mr. Wick.

322
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,610
Are you here on business, sir?

323
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,150
Afraid so, Francis.

324
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,880
Why don't you take
the night off.

325
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,320
Thank you, sir.

326
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:00,950
Fuck you, motherfucker!

327
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,760
Where is losef?

328
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,070
Bath house, downstairs.

329
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:20,190
Go!

330
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:29,470
John Wick's there. Go get him!

331
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,950
Move! He's here! He's fucking here!
He's there! He's coming!

332
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,960
Get in! Get in!

333
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:37,120
Come on, come on!

334
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,700
CHARON: Good evening, Mr. Wick.

335
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:24,830
Good evening.

336
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:26,670
How may I be of service?

337
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:27,730
Is the doctor in?

338
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:29,600
Yes, sir. 24/7.

339
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,600
Then send him up, please.
Yes, sir.

340
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:33,110
How good's your laundry?

341
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:37,580
I'm sorry to say that
no one's that good.

342
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:41,410
No. I thought not.

343
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:44,320
May I suggest a drink, sir.

344
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:45,520
Bourbon, perhaps.

345
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:48,690
That sounds perfect.

346
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:05,810
So what sort of movement
am I looking at?

347
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:08,540
Well, if you're lookin' to heal,

348
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:09,840
then keep it marginal.

349
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:14,380
However, if you still have...

350
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:15,880
...business
to attend to,

351
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,820
take two of these beforehand.

352
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:25,130
Your stitches'll tear
and you'll bleed,

353
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:29,160
but you'll have full function.

354
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,730
Do you need anything
for the pain?

355
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:34,200
No, I've got that covered.

356
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:42,570
Hey, John.

357
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:47,310
Perkins?

358
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:48,470
I thought I'd let myself in.

359
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:51,340
I noticed.

360
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:02,360
I never knew Ms. Perkins to get
out of bed for less than three.

361
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,320
Viggo's giving me four
to break hotel rules.

362
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:05,890
That's unwise, I assure you.

363
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:14,500
You were always a pussy.

364
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:32,480
Yes?

365
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,650
<i>CHARON:  I apologize for
calling you at this hour,</i>

366
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:37,780
but we have received a
number of grievances

367
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:39,690
from your floor
concerning the noise.

368
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:43,620
JOHN: My apologies.

369
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:47,660
I was dealing with
an uninvited guest.

370
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:49,730
Have you need then of, say,

371
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:51,860
a dinner reservation, perhaps?

372
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:54,570
JOHN: Perhaps. I'll
have to get back to you.

373
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:03,440
No!

374
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:06,550
Where's losef?

375
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:07,610
Fuck you.

376
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:08,680
Where's Viggo?

377
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,980
I'm not telling you shit!

378
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:13,450
Do you really wanna
die here, Perkins?

379
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,620
Give me somethin'.

380
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:22,700
Little Russia.

381
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:25,830
There's a church
near Cannon Court.

382
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:27,070
<i>JOHN: What about it?</i>

383
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:28,600
<i>PERKINS: It's a front.</i>

384
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,240
It's where Viggo keeps
his private stash.

385
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:33,810
Thank you.

386
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:42,420
MAN: Do I know you?

387
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:45,620
I'm thinkin' so.

388
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:54,630
Hey, John.

389
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:56,530
Hey, Harry.

390
01:00:56,530 --> 01:00:57,960
Everything all right?

391
01:00:57,970 --> 01:01:00,900
Yeah. Everything's fine.

392
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,840
I'll leave you to it, then.

393
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:04,900
Hey, Harry?

394
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:08,670
You keen on earning a coin?

395
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:10,140
Babysittin' the sleepin' one?

396
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:11,610
Catch and release?

397
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:12,850
Catch and release.

398
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:46,710
My son, how might I help you?

399
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:54,830
Motherfucker!

400
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:07,800
Let's go to the vault.

401
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:20,370
Open it.

402
01:02:27,790 --> 01:02:28,960
Viggo will kill me.

403
01:02:33,890 --> 01:02:34,890
Uh-huh.

404
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:48,110
Ladies, out.

405
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,220
Honestly,

406
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:05,690
what do you think you're
going to do with all of that?

407
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:07,260
This.

408
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:58,680
HARRY: Don't worry.

409
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,050
Housekeeping will find you.

410
01:04:01,350 --> 01:04:03,350
Treat all your ladies like this?

411
01:04:03,350 --> 01:04:06,250
You are no lady. Trust me.

412
01:04:13,230 --> 01:04:14,930
Harry, is it?

413
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,930
How'd you like to earn
more than just a gold coin?

414
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,940
You've broken the rules.

415
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:29,110
You've done business
on Continental grounds.

416
01:04:29,110 --> 01:04:33,250
And management does not take
kindly to that sort of behavior.

417
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:36,380
Fuck management.

418
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:46,030
Don't worry. Housekeeping
will find you.

419
01:04:52,870 --> 01:04:54,630
Ashes to ashes.

420
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,400
Can we recover from this?

421
01:04:57,410 --> 01:04:58,970
Viggo, you know what was
in that vault, right?

422
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:00,270
It was nothing.

423
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:05,910
Shit!

424
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,230
Come on!

425
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:44,940
VIGGO: I'll say this, John.

426
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:47,510
They sure as fuck broke
the mold with you.

427
01:06:50,990 --> 01:06:52,420
Ay, ay...

428
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:03,860
You always had a certain...

429
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:07,170
audacity about you, you know.

430
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,370
Right? Oh, yeah.

431
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:18,410
I can say you're still very
much the John Wick of old.

432
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:20,510
Am I?

433
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:27,220
People don't change.
You know that.

434
01:07:28,290 --> 01:07:30,020
Times, they do.

435
01:07:34,130 --> 01:07:37,360
Do you know what
was in that vault?

436
01:07:37,370 --> 01:07:39,500
Artwork, cash, not
without its worth,

437
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:42,230
but the leverage I
had on this city,

438
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:46,170
audio recordings, physical
evidence, blackmail,

439
01:07:46,170 --> 01:07:47,510
it was fuckin' priceless!

440
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:50,040
Priceless!

441
01:07:52,810 --> 01:07:56,380
Yeah. I kind of enjoyed that.

442
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:59,390
Yeah, I know you did.

443
01:07:59,390 --> 01:08:00,450
Yeah.

444
01:08:01,490 --> 01:08:02,890
Are you really laughing?

445
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:11,260
So...

446
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,470
Then you got married, ah?
Settled down.

447
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:20,150
How did you manage that anyways?

448
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:22,580
Luck, I guess.

449
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:26,050
Yeah.

450
01:08:26,050 --> 01:08:29,080
Yeah, while you had
your wife, I had my son.

451
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:32,150
And believe me, you
had a far better deal.

452
01:08:37,390 --> 01:08:39,430
And then you left.

453
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:41,560
And the way you got out,

454
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:47,030
lying to yourself that the past
held no sway over the future.

455
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:48,630
But in the end,

456
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:55,270
a lot of us are rewarded
for our misdeeds,

457
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:59,010
which is why God took your wife

458
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:03,020
and unleashed you upon me.

459
01:09:04,990 --> 01:09:09,120
This life follows you.

460
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:14,030
It clings to you,

461
01:09:14,030 --> 01:09:19,370
infecting everyone who
comes close to you.

462
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:22,170
We are cursed, you and I.

463
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:26,670
On that we agree.

464
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:32,680
Finally, common ground.

465
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:35,350
Okay.

466
01:09:35,350 --> 01:09:37,620
Step aside.

467
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:39,550
Give me your son.

468
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,190
John Wick.

469
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:52,200
It was just a fucking car!
Just a fuckin' dog!

470
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,630
Just a dog...

471
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,040
Viggo?

472
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,070
Yeah.

473
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:01,310
When Helen died, I
lost everything.

474
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:06,150
Until that dog arrived
on my doorstep.

475
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:09,380
A final gift from my wife.

476
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:12,550
In that moment, I received
some semblance of hope.

477
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:17,620
An opportunity to
grieve unalone.

478
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:21,330
And your son

479
01:10:22,330 --> 01:10:24,230
took that from me!

480
01:10:24,230 --> 01:10:25,300
Oh, come on...

481
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:27,330
Stole that from me!

482
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:30,300
Killed that from me!

483
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:33,040
People keep asking if I'm back.

484
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:35,640
And I haven't really
had an answer.

485
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:39,350
But now, yeah, I'm
thinkin' I'm back!

486
01:10:39,350 --> 01:10:42,450
So you can either hand over your son...

487
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:46,120
or you can die
screaming alongside him!

488
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,040
Cool it, cool it, cool
it, cool it, cool it!

489
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:27,180
John!

490
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:30,920
Where is he? Shit.

491
01:13:32,890 --> 01:13:34,220
Shit!

492
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:41,730
I have your word that if
I tell you where he is,

493
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:43,560
you'll let me walk away?

494
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:44,800
Pull the contract.

495
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:50,540
Done.

496
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:58,380
He's kept in a safe house.
Brooklyn.

497
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:00,250
434 Wallace Place.

498
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:04,350
They know you're coming.

499
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:06,420
Of course.

500
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:07,820
But it won't matter.

501
01:14:59,910 --> 01:15:01,710
Will you stop playing
the fucking video game?

502
01:15:15,490 --> 01:15:18,420
Will you stop playing
that fucking video game?

503
01:15:29,670 --> 01:15:30,870
Get down, get down!

504
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:42,710
Come on, come on!
Get down, get down!

505
01:17:01,890 --> 01:17:03,060
Make the arrangements.

506
01:17:21,610 --> 01:17:22,610
Thank you.

507
01:17:23,850 --> 01:17:25,080
Our pleasure, sir.

508
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:32,490
A parting gift.
From the management.

509
01:17:32,490 --> 01:17:34,690
Compensation for last
night's unfortunate

510
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:36,800
incident.

511
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,850
MARCUS: How many times do
I have to save your ass?

512
01:18:27,850 --> 01:18:28,880
JOHN: I appreciate it.

513
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:30,950
MARCUS: Of course.

514
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:31,980
You look terrible.

515
01:18:32,990 --> 01:18:34,820
No, I look retired.

516
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:36,490
Retired?

517
01:18:36,490 --> 01:18:37,920
You really believe that?

518
01:18:52,570 --> 01:18:54,170
You made a new life.

519
01:18:56,210 --> 01:18:57,810
You'll find your way back to it.

520
01:18:59,910 --> 01:19:01,550
It's time to go home.

521
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:59,140
Let's get on with this,
whatever the fuck this is.

522
01:19:59,140 --> 01:20:00,270
VIGGO: Hello, Marcus.

523
01:20:13,890 --> 01:20:14,990
This is John.

524
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:19,620
I appreciate you granting
my son a swift death.

525
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:24,800
<i>I wouldn't know how to
reply to that either.</i>

526
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,930
Marcus betrayed me.

527
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:42,150
You pulled the contract.

528
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:46,920
And while it was open,
you had every chance,

529
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:50,190
every opportunity
to kill John Wick.

530
01:20:50,190 --> 01:20:53,290
And if you had done your job,

531
01:20:53,290 --> 01:20:55,590
my son would be still alive!

532
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:00,130
<i>And in so doing,</i>

533
01:21:00,130 --> 01:21:02,300
he broke the cardinal rule.

534
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:05,340
Thank you.

535
01:21:09,210 --> 01:21:10,280
Ms. Perkins.

536
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:14,280
Why am I not surprised?

537
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:16,380
In for a penny, in for a pound.

538
01:21:18,050 --> 01:21:21,290
<i>VIGGO: So, John,
I had no choice.</i>

539
01:21:22,290 --> 01:21:24,660
I always liked you, Marcus.

540
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:28,190
The last of the old guard.

541
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:33,900
Oh.

542
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:40,940
But unlike the others,
you go out on my terms.

543
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:43,780
God! No!

544
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:48,150
No, my good sir.

545
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,780
I go out on my own.

546
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:14,740
See?

547
01:22:26,390 --> 01:22:27,950
Well played, old friend.

548
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:37,130
AVI: We done, Viggo?

549
01:22:37,130 --> 01:22:38,800
We're done.

550
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:39,800
Okay. Here.

551
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,030
Thank you.

552
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:47,470
Yeah. Fuel the chopper.

553
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:14,470
<i>CHARON: Ms. Perkins, I apologize
for calling you at this hour.</i>

554
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:00,080
Ms. Perkins,

555
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:02,250
your membership to the
Continental has been,

556
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:05,020
by thine own hand, revoked.

557
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:34,580
<i>WINSTON: I know what
you're thinking, Jonathan.</i>

558
01:24:34,580 --> 01:24:36,480
<i>We live by a code.</i>

559
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,180
Which is why I'm not the
one telling you that

560
01:24:38,190 --> 01:24:40,190
a certain helicopter
at a certain helipad

561
01:24:40,190 --> 01:24:42,520
is being fueled for
a certain someone.

562
01:25:01,570 --> 01:25:02,910
Have you got my cigarettes?

563
01:25:02,910 --> 01:25:04,070
Yeah, I got your cigarettes.

564
01:25:27,970 --> 01:25:28,970
AVI: Oh, fuck!

565
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:34,240
Yeah. Super. Come on, let's go.
Faster!

566
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:36,360
The helicopter's right down there.
Come on! Let's go!

567
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:50,560
Oh, shit!

568
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:52,620
Goddamn, I knew he'd come.

569
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:09,340
What's fuckin' wrong
with this guy?

570
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:11,040
Somebody give me a gun.
Who's got a gun?

571
01:26:13,310 --> 01:26:14,680
Oh, God!

572
01:26:16,450 --> 01:26:18,380
That was a good one.

573
01:26:18,390 --> 01:26:19,390
Who's got a gun?

574
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:36,600
AVI: Fuck!

575
01:26:53,650 --> 01:26:56,370
Viggo, the helicopters, right over there.
We have to get over there.

576
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:07,670
Ah!

577
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:14,710
Oh, my God, I need a gun.

578
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:38,600
English, please.

579
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:39,660
Good luck.

580
01:27:41,330 --> 01:27:43,270
Russian cocksucker.

581
01:27:43,270 --> 01:27:44,470
Ah!

582
01:27:44,470 --> 01:27:45,640
Fuck!

583
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:12,760
No!

584
01:29:15,790 --> 01:29:17,660
VIGGO: No more guns, John.

585
01:29:20,130 --> 01:29:21,770
No more bullets.

586
01:29:22,770 --> 01:29:24,400
No more bullets.

587
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:34,350
Just you and me, John.

588
01:29:35,510 --> 01:29:36,550
You and me.

589
01:30:00,370 --> 01:30:02,710
What happened, John?

590
01:30:02,710 --> 01:30:05,480
We were professionals.
Civilized.

591
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:07,350
Do I look civilized to you?

592
01:31:30,430 --> 01:31:32,260
Be seeing you, John.

593
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:35,670
Yeah.

594
01:31:36,770 --> 01:31:38,440
Be seeing you.

595
01:32:29,690 --> 01:32:32,920
<i>HELEN: Come on, John.
Let's go home.</i>

596
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,060
It's okay.

597
01:34:19,730 --> 01:34:20,970
Let's go home.
