1
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,560
Orbilus, look! It's Unicron!

2
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,120
The ships! Get to the ships!
It's our only chance!

3
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,280
Kranix! Ahh!

4
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,960
It is the year 2005.

5
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,720
The treacherous decepticons

6
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,800
have conquered the autobots'
home planet of Cybertron.

7
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,640
But from secret staging grounds
on two of Cybertron's moons

8
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,400
the valiant autobots prepare
to retake their homeland.

9
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,200
Ironhide, report to me at once.

10
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,760
Every time I look into
a monitor, Prime,

11
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,520
my circuits sizzle.

12
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,800
When are we gonna
start busting decepti-chops?

13
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,680
I want you to make a special run
to Autobot City on Earth.

14
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,040
- But, Prime--
- listen, Ironhide,

15
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,800
we don't have enough
energon cubes

16
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,040
to power a full-scale assault.

17
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,440
Ready the shuttle for launch!

18
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,600
Your days are numbered now,
decepti-creeps.

19
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,920
Jazz, report security status.

20
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,840
No sign of decepticons here,
Prime.

21
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,600
What about Moonbase Two?

22
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,800
Jazz to Moonbase Two.
Jazz to Moonbase Two.

23
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,480
Bumblebee and Spike here.

24
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,480
We're about to
send up a shuttle.

25
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,200
Any decepticon shenanigans
in your area?

26
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,440
All clear, Jazz.

27
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,880
Hey, Ironhide, tell my son,
Daniel, I miss him.

28
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,480
And tell him not to worry.

29
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,280
I'll be coming home as soon as
we've kicked Megatron's tail

30
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,800
across the galaxy.

31
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,560
Will do, Spike.

32
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,560
Cliffjumper,
commence countdown.

33
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,680
Five, four, three,

34
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,880
two, one.

35
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,240
Blastoff!

36
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,600
Now, all we need is a little
energon and a lot of luck.

37
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,920
Laserbeak returns, Megatron.

38
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,920
Welcome, Laserbeak.

39
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,520
Unlike some of my other warriors
you never fail me.

40
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,080
Soundwave, play back
Laserbeak's findings.

41
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,840
As you command, Megatron.

42
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,360
I want you to make a special run
to Autobot City on Earth.

43
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,600
- But, Prime--
- listen, Ironhide,

44
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,600
we don't have enough
energon cubes

45
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,920
to power a full-scale assault.

46
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,040
Ready the shuttle for launch!

47
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,600
Now, all we need is a little
energon and a lot of luck.

48
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,960
More than you imagine,
Optimus Prime.

49
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,000
Megatron!

50
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,120
Decepticons!

51
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,120
Die, autobots!

52
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,120
This was almost too easy,
Starscream.

53
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:49,920
Much easier, almighty Megatron,
than attacking the real threat--

54
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,360
the autobots' moonbase.

55
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,560
You're an idiot, Starscream

56
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,360
when we slip by their early
warning systems

57
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,720
in their own shuttle
and destroy Autobot City

58
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,720
the autobots
will be vanquished forever!

59
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,840
No!

60
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,880
Such heroic nonsense.

61
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,520
Fish are jumping today,
huh, Danno?

62
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,880
- I guess so.
- Hey, what's the matter?

63
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,160
Oh, I don't know, Hotrod.

64
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,440
Come on, you can tell me.

65
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,480
I guess I just miss my dad.

66
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,360
Don't worry,
Spike'll be back soon.

67
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,600
Oh, hey! I got something!

68
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,960
Wow! Look at the size of it!

69
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,640
Yep, it's a whopper all right!

70
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,280
Hotrod, the shuttle's coming!
Let's watch it land!

71
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,560
Talk about dull, Daniel.

72
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,800
Hurry or we'll miss it!

73
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,200
If you're gonna ride, Danno,
ride in style!

74
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,160
Let's stop here!

75
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,040
Why settle for a peek, Daniel,

76
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,120
when you can see everything
from lookout mountain?

77
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,360
A little to the left.
A little bit more.

78
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,960
Turbo-revvin' young punk--
I'll straighten you out yet!

79
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,360
Hotrod, look!
There's a hole in the shuttle!

80
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,320
What?!

81
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,960
Decepticons!

82
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,240
What's that darn fool doing?

83
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,800
Attack!

84
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,240
Daniel!

85
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,320
Come on down, autobrat!

86
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,280
Huh, not bad for an old-timer.

87
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,200
"Old-timer"?
That's something you'll never be

88
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,200
if you don't get
back to the city.

89
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,560
Save it, Kup!

90
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,520
Let's burn rubber!

91
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,000
Ultra Magnus,
a cursory evaluation

92
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,600
of decepticon capability

93
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,120
indicates a distinct
tactical deficiency.

94
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,800
In other words, Perceptor?

95
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,800
We're outnumbered!

96
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,720
Springer, you and Arcee
transform Autobot City.

97
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,080
Perceptor, tell Blaster to radio
Prime for reinforcements.

98
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,080
What about me, Magnus?
What about me? Huh? Huh? Huh?

99
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,600
I can help. I wanna help.
What about me?

100
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,240
Blurr, you can help me
alert the others.

101
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,640
Absolutely positively
definitely.

102
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,640
Nobody can get the job done
faster than I can. Nobody!

103
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,880
Come on, Arcee, let's go!

104
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,440
But Hotrod and Kup
are still outside the city!

105
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,920
We can't wait.

106
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,320
They'll have to take care
of themselves. Come on!

107
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,800
Pathetic fools!

108
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,720
There's no escape!

109
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,760
Oh!

110
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,960
Ah! My foot!

111
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,880
Breach their defenses!

112
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,080
Mm, delicious. Eh, scrapmate?

113
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,760
Er, a little heavy
on the electrons, electron.

114
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,320
The insecticons
are in our way!

115
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,440
Wrong!
They're our way in!

116
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,800
Yah!

117
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,240
Look out and shout! Ow!

118
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,560
Hey, Perceptor, what's shaking
--other than this fortress?

119
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,240
Blaster, Ultra Magnus
sends orders

120
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,040
to contact Optimus Prime
on Moonbase One.

121
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,080
All right,
cover your receptors, Perceptor!

122
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,040
Optimus Prime, do you read me?

123
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,560
The decepticons
are blitzing Autobot City.

124
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,520
We're really taking a pounding!

125
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,720
Don't know how much longer
we can hold out.

126
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,440
Soundwave,
jam that transmission!

127
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:43,200
Rumble, Frenzy, Ravage, Ratbat--
eject. Operation: Interference!

128
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,400
Optimus Prime,
do you read me?

129
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,000
The decepticons are blitzing
Autobot City.

130
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,880
We're really taking...

131
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,200
first we crack the shell,

132
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,280
then we crack the nuts inside!

133
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,360
Hey! Run, Blaster!
Save yourself!

134
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,520
No way! Two can play!

135
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,120
Sic 'em!

136
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,800
Do you think
you got through to Prime?

137
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,200
Let's hope so. Cos if I didn't

138
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,760
we're all gonna look like
burnt-out toaster ovens.

139
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,360
We've got decepticons at the
gates! Decepticons in the air!

140
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,960
Decepticons inside the
walls! Decepticons! Decepticons!

141
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,160
If we beat them at the walls
they're still in the air,

142
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,800
so where does that leave us?
Nowhere, that's where!

143
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,320
Come on, Arcee, we gotta get
this launcher into place.

144
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,440
Megatron's making his big push
and we gotta push back!

145
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,560
Keep at it, Springer, my boy,
help's to hand!

146
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,200
Together now.

147
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,680
I was afraid you'd be trapped
outside the city.

148
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,880
Unh! Hey, I wasn't worried
for a microsecond.

149
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,280
Then you probably didn't
understand the situation.

150
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,560
That did it.

151
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,040
Constructicons,
merge for the kill!

152
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,800
Kup, Hotrod, look!

153
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,520
Devastator.

154
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,960
Prepare
for extermination!

155
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,160
I got better things
to do tonight than die.

156
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,840
Their defenses are
broken, let the slaughter begin!

157
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,400
Dinobots, destroy Devastator!

158
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,600
Me, Grimlock, love challenge!

159
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,640
Dinobots transform!

160
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,360
Megatron must be stopped...

161
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,320
no matter the cost.

162
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,240
Prime!

163
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,280
One shall stand, one shall fall.

164
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,480
Why throw away your life
so recklessly?

165
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,840
That's a question you should
ask yourself, Megatron.

166
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,680
No, I'll crush you
with my bare hands!

167
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,240
I've got to help Prime!

168
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,080
Stay away, lad,
that's Prime's fight!

169
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,240
I'll rip out your optics!

170
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,600
Finish him off, Prime!
Do it now!

171
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,360
No more, Optimus Prime!

172
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,920
Grant me mercy, I beg of you!

173
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,800
You, who are without mercy,
now plead for it?

174
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,240
I thought you were
made of sterner stuff.

175
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,320
No, you don't, Megatron!

176
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,120
Out of the way, Hotrod!

177
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,200
Fall! Fall!

178
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,800
I would've waited
an eternity for this

179
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,920
it's over, Prime.

180
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,720
Never!

181
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,760
Optimus... forgive me.

182
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,720
How do you feel,
mighty Megatron?

183
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,880
Yah!

184
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:59,000
Astrotrain, transform
and get us out of here.

185
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,000
Don't leave me, Soundwave.

186
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,200
As you command, Megatron.

187
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
The decepticons are retreating.

188
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,840
Prime did it,
he turned the tide.

189
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,360
Astrotrain, take off!

190
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,680
I fear the wounds are fatal.

191
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,520
Prime, you can't die!

192
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,600
Do not grieve.

193
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,720
Soon I shall be
one with the matrix.

194
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,960
Prime...

195
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:34,640
Ultra Magnus,
it... it is to you, old friend...

196
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,160
I shall pass
the matrix of leadership

197
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,200
as it was passed to me.

198
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,120
But, Prime,
I am... just a soldier, I...

199
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,840
I'm not worthy.

200
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,800
nor was I,

201
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,920
but one day an autobot
shall rise from our ranks

202
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,240
and use the power of the matrix

203
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,360
to light... our darkest hour.

204
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,720
Until that day...

205
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,280
till all are one...

206
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,520
Jettison some weight or I'll
never make it to Cybertron!

207
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,760
Fellow decepticons!

208
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,600
Astrotrain has requested
that we lighten our burden.

209
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,760
In that case I say it is
survival of the fittest.

210
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,920
Do I hear a second on that?

211
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,600
Aye!

212
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,120
And against?

213
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,880
Nay!

214
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,360
The ayes have it!

215
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,480
- Get! Make room for others!
- Don't!

216
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,480
Oh, how it pains me to do this.

217
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,760
Wait...

218
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,800
I still function.

219
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,480
Wanna bet?

220
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,160
Starscream!

221
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:39,040
Well, as Megatron has,
how shall we say, departed,

222
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,320
I nominate myself
as the new leader.

223
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,480
Wait, the constructicons
formed Devastator,

224
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,480
the most powerful robot.
We should rule!

225
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,680
Soundwave superior.
Constructicons inferior.

226
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,000
Who are you calling inferior?!

227
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,720
Nobody would follow an
uncharismatic bore like you!

228
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,720
Hey, nobody calls
Soundwave uncrassimatic!

229
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,720
Yeah, let's kick tailgate!

230
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,200
Constructicons unite!

231
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,560
No way!

232
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,800
Welcome, Megatron.

233
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,000
Who... who said that?

234
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,480
I... am Unicron.

235
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,360
Show yourself.

236
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,560
I have summoned you here
for a purpose.

237
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,720
Nobody summons Megatron.

238
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,320
Then it pleases me
to be the first.

239
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,000
State your business.

240
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,600
This is my command.

241
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,600
You are to destroy the
autobot matrix of leadership.

242
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:33,600
It is the one thing,
the only thing,

243
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,200
that can stand in my way.

244
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,840
You have nothing to fear.

245
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:43,400
I have already crushed Optimus
Prime with my bare hands.

246
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,160
You exaggerate.

247
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,120
The point is, he's dead.

248
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,400
And the matrix died with him.

249
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,640
No, the point is you are a fool.

250
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,440
The matrix has been passed
to their new leader,

251
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,520
Ultra Magnus.

252
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,680
- Destroy it for me.
- Why should I?

253
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,240
What's in it for me?

254
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,280
Your bargaining posture
is highly dubious.

255
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:12,480
Very well, I will
provide you with a new body

256
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,280
and new troops to command.

257
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,480
- And?
- And nothing!

258
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,120
You belong to me now.

259
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,920
I belong to nobody!

260
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,720
Perhaps I misjudged you.

261
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,560
Proceed...

262
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,560
on your way to oblivion.

263
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,560
Ah! No! No!

264
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,360
I accept your terms! I accept!

265
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,680
Ah!

266
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,960
Excellent.

267
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,560
Behold... Galvatron!

268
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,960
And these shall be your minions.

269
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,040
Scourge, the tracker.

270
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,360
And his huntsmen-- the sweeps.

271
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,520
Cyclonus

272
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,600
the warrior and his armada.

273
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,720
And this shall be your ship.

274
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,840
Now go.

275
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,840
Destroy the autobot matrix.

276
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:44,000
I will rip open Ultra Magnus
and every other autobot

277
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,080
until the matrix
has been destroyed.

278
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,240
To Cybertron!

279
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,800
Destroy the matrix.

280
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,520
Get on with the ceremony!

281
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,280
My fellow decepticons

282
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,120
as your new leader, I...

283
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,080
who disrupts my coronation?!

284
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:48,440
"Coronation", Starscream?
This is bad comedy.

285
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,720
Megatron? Is that you?

286
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,360
Here's a hint!

287
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,400
Will anyone else
attempt to fill his shoes?

288
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,000
What did he say his name was?

289
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,640
Galvatron!

290
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,960
Long live Galvatron!

291
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,200
Galvatron!

292
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,160
Where'd that come from?

293
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,800
Who cares? I'm more worried
about where it's going!

294
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,360
Talk to me, Earth,
we got a situation out here!

295
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,120
Roger me, wilco me, anything!
Hello, hello, Earth!

296
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,080
I'm picking up a faint signal.

297
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,280
This is Jazz. A ginormous,
weird-looking planet

298
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,040
just showed up
in the suburbs of Cybertron.

299
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,640
And it's
attacking Moonbase One!

300
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,240
Jazz! Cliffjumper!

301
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,320
Got to blast free, if we can!

302
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,040
Ignition and... hit it!

303
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,280
Jazz, we're not getting away!

304
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,000
This is Spike and Bumblebee
up here on Moonbase Two.

305
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,600
This thing... this monster planet

306
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,960
just ripped
the first moon to shreds

307
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,360
and it's heading this way!

308
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,360
We'll try and slow it down.

309
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,800
But you'd better get here fast
because we're not gonna...

310
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,080
dad!

311
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,120
Bumblebee,
activate the explosives!

312
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,000
If this doesn't stop it,
nothing will.

313
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,000
The explosives are activated,
let's get out of here!

314
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,440
Hurry!
It's gonna blow!

315
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,440
- Hooray! We've done it!
- We did it!

316
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,440
Way to go!

317
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,240
- Look!
- It isn't even dented.

318
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,760
Oh, shit,
what are we gonna do now?

319
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,960
We're being
sucked into it!

320
00:34:54,680 --> 00:35:00,840
How dare Unicron? Cybertron
and all its moons belong to me!

321
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,600
Remember, we belong to him.

322
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,520
I belong to nobody!

323
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,920
I will obey... Unicron.

324
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,000
Decepticons, to Earth!

325
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,160
Autobots, prepare to
board the shuttles.

326
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,840
This new menace
is more dangerous

327
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,840
than all the decepticons
put together.

328
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,520
Somehow we must destroy it
before it devours Cybertron.

329
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,200
But what about my dad?

330
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,880
He's on the moon between that
monster planet and Cybertron.

331
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,240
Daniel, we'll do everything
we can for Spike.

332
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,120
And what are we gonna do
when we get there?

333
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,160
If that thing crunches moons
it'll make short work of us.

334
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,120
Maybe the matrix can stop it.

335
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,560
You're right, it can!

336
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,400
What do you know about it, lad?

337
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,560
I just got this feeling.

338
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,960
Look!

339
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,280
To the shuttles!

340
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:15,160
I, Galvatron, will crush you
just as Megatron crushed Prime!

341
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,920
And you'll die trying,
just like Megatron.

342
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,280
Uh! Autobot scrap!

343
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,240
Do you want me
to gut Ultra Magnus?

344
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:29,440
There are plenty of autobots
for you. Ultra Magnus is mine!

345
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,080
Stay close to me, Daniel!

346
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,880
And you better stay close to me!

347
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,320
No, you'd better
stay close to me.

348
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,480
Nice dino, good dino,
sweet dino,

349
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,720
won't you step into
the nice spaceship for Blurr?

350
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,240
Pretty, pretty please? Nice
dino, good dino, sweet dino!

351
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,480
Me Grimlock, not nice dino!

352
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,960
Me bash brains!

353
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,080
Blurr, get the dinobots
in the shuttle!

354
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,320
I'm trying to get them
into the shuttle

355
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,520
cos I know we can't
launch the shuttle

356
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,680
until I get them
into the shuttle

357
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,720
but they're impossible,
impossible, impossible!

358
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,920
OK, forget it.

359
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,400
Kup, Hotrod, you guys
get the dinobots aboard

360
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,160
and get out of here.

361
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,440
Come on, you big bozo,
get in the shuttle!

362
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,560
This reminds me
of the battle on alpha 9.

363
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,800
The petrorabbits were...

364
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,160
Grimlock, get your noodle
out of my face!

365
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,160
Me Grimlock
love Kup's war stories!

366
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,840
You're living one now.

367
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,040
Engage the boosters,
for Cybertron's sake!

368
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,920
Tell Grimlock about
petro-rabbits again.

369
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,880
I'll give you petro-rabbits!

370
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,120
Contact!

371
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,040
Looks like we're
shipmates, squirt!

372
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,440
All right!

373
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,680
But if you get spacesick
you're gonna walk home!

374
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,440
Hurry!

375
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,520
Wait, Ultra Magnus!
Arcee's still out there!

376
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,120
Jump!

377
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,160
Thanks.

378
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,440
That was close.

379
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,880
Believe it or not,
this is the fun part.

380
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,960
Congratulations,
autobots, we've lost them,

381
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,880
so rest while you can.

382
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,160
Yep, I remember,
the dust was so thick on beta 4

383
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,080
you had to use windshield wipers
on your optic sensors.

384
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,040
Me Grimlock
know all about wipers!

385
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,960
Want to hear good part of story!

386
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,680
Good part, Kup,
tell Swoop good part.

387
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,920
OK, OK.

388
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,400
Well, the dust was really thick,

389
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,240
and then this gigantic icthyac

390
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,320
came tromping and stomping
down the mountain,

391
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,880
flames spewing out
of its nostrils,

392
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,480
and I thought for sure...

393
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,120
hey, Kup, don't you think we
have better things to do now

394
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,360
than tell old stories?

395
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,480
Like what?

396
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,880
Like maybe figure out

397
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,720
how we're gonna
rescue our friends

398
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,120
and then save Cybertron.

399
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,080
No! Tell story!

400
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,920
- Shh!
- Quiet!

401
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,800
We want to hear story!

402
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,160
- Grr!
- Time-out! Time-out! Time-out!

403
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,720
They're closing on us.

404
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,240
Yep, like the shrikebats
of Dromedon.

405
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,760
- How'd you beat them?
- I'm trying to remember.

406
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,280
There were an awful lot
of casualties that day.

407
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,320
Oh, yeah--
we inverted polarities!

408
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,240
They're coming back!

409
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,520
All right, we survived that!

410
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,600
Yeah, but will we survive this?

411
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,920
Cyclonus,
transform and attack.

412
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,200
I can't control it!

413
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,760
We're gonna crash!

414
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,560
Kup and Hotrod just bought it.

415
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,560
I can't deal with that now.

416
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,880
Face it, Magnus,

417
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:36,040
the decepticons are gonna dog us
until they see us dead!

418
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,680
Then that's exactly
what they're gonna see.

419
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,680
Prepare for
emergency separation.

420
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,920
- That's too dangerous!
- What choice do we have?

421
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,440
The autobots
have been terminated.

422
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,800
Excellent.
And the matrix with them.

423
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,520
Unicron!

424
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:27,080
Why?! Take me to Unicron.
Take me now!

425
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,200
Ah!

426
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:44,360
Did we have to let them detonate
three-quarters of the ship?

427
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,920
Seeing as how they would have
detonated four-quarters,

428
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,680
I think it was a good choice.

429
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,040
But how are we gonna get there
in this wreck?

430
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,120
Perceptor, can you locate
a place to set down for repairs?

431
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,280
Gamma waves
in this sector of space

432
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,480
create marginal navigation
probabilities. However...

433
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,680
ahem... yes, I believe I can.

434
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,560
The planet of junk
is in this vicinity.

435
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,400
Then let's go for it.

436
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,920
Kup! Grimlock!

437
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,320
Slag! Anybody!

438
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,520
Hotrod! Help me!

439
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,640
Kup?!

440
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,040
Kup!

441
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,280
Help!

442
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,280
Kup?

443
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,840
Talk to me!

444
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,320
- Fix me...
- sure, Kup, right away.

445
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,800
Brace for impact!

446
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,280
Say something... anybody!

447
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,080
Remind me to give
the autopilot a raise.

448
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,680
Daniel?

449
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,000
I... I'm OK.

450
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,280
Let's try to salvage this thing.

451
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,040
Can I help too?

452
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,160
It's rough out there, kid.

453
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,320
I think Daniel can make himself
useful with this.

454
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,200
It was Spike's exo-suit.

455
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,720
Dad's exo-suit!
He told me all about it.

456
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,200
Here, try it on.

457
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,080
Now, try to walk.
Come on, you can do it.

458
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,800
Just think about what you
want to do before you do it.

459
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,880
It... it's kind of tricky.

460
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,040
Whoa! Oh!

461
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,560
Keep on practicing,
you'll get the hang of it.

462
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,360
Come on, showtime's over.
We've got work to do.

463
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,440
This must be the junk capital
of the universe.

464
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,040
Stop, thief!
No welcome-wagon hello stranger

465
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,280
with that good coffee
flavor for you.

466
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,280
Offer expires while you wait.
Operators are standing by.

467
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,600
That does it.
Well, what do you think?

468
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,320
Of all the circuit-glitched,
diode-blowing dim-wittery

469
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,960
you left a piece out!

470
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,080
No way!
You're just a little stiff.

471
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:42,880
Anyway, all things considered,
you did an amazing job, lad.

472
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:43,960
Amazing!

473
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,920
- Really?
- Yeah.

474
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,920
You even got rid of
that nasty burr in my rotator.

475
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,760
Now, let's find the dinobots
and get off this twisted planet.

476
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,960
Don't act hostile.
I'll use the universal greeting.

477
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,240
"Universal greeting"?

478
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:18,040
Watch, I'll have 'em
eating out of my hand.

479
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:21,720
Baa weep grahna
weep ninny bong!

480
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,280
"Baa weep grahna
weep ninny bong"?

481
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:28,600
Baa weep grahna
weep ninny bong.

482
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,760
See? The universal greeting
works every time.

483
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,480
Now, without making
any sudden moves,

484
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,440
offer them an energon goodie.

485
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,440
This is getting expensive!

486
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,840
Don't worry,
they'll reciprocate.

487
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,320
I thought they were
supposed to reciprocate?

488
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,360
No more!

489
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,440
Empty!

490
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,760
Reminds me of the Nitith
slave mines on Galganas 7.

491
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,440
Every place
reminds you of someplace else.

492
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,120
Experience, lad, you should
learn to appreciate it.

493
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,760
Lot of good
it's done us so far.

494
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,320
Hey, what's going on over there?

495
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:29,720
Has the imperial magistrate
reached a verdict?

496
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,480
I have.

497
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:34,480
Guilty
or innocent?

498
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,520
Innocent.

499
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,200
Feed him to the sharkticons.

500
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,720
We've got to get
a new travel agent.

501
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,760
What is this place?

502
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,200
The world of
the savage sharkticons

503
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,240
and their cruel masters,
the Quintessons.

504
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,120
I am Kranix.

505
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,840
My planet was
destroyed by Unicron.

506
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,400
Unicron? Who's Unicron?

507
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,920
A planet that devours
everything in its path.

508
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,680
So that's the monster's name.

509
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,280
No, please!

510
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:30,680
Ah! I'm the last survivor
of Lithone!

511
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,160
No!

512
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,720
Let him go!

513
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,320
Ah!

514
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:40,160
Soon you too
shall receive your sentence.

515
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,760
Has the imperial magistrate
reached a verdict?

516
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,360
I have.

517
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,560
Guilty or innocent?

518
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,880
Spare me
this mockery of justice!

519
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:58,840
I repeat, guilty or innocent?

520
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,240
Innocent.

521
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,720
Ah!

522
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,120
Ah!

523
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,040
Not the end I'd wish for, lad.

524
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,480
Me Swoop no see nothing.

525
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:33,160
Me Grimlock positive
Hotrod and Kup close

526
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:37,120
me Slag say you
full of beryllium baloney

527
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:43,480
me Grimlock say you
full of cesium salami!

528
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,560
Beryllium baloney!

529
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,960
Who say that?

530
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,880
you go wrong way.
You fool, I say.

531
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,120
Me Grimlock, fool?

532
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:07,040
Picture you got,
no fool you not!

533
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,200
Me Grimlock no like you.

534
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,920
Ow!

535
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,760
Why boy hit my nose?

536
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,320
Wheelie save my friends today.

537
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,960
Me Grimlock say we on our way.

538
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:48,080
Unicron,
why did you torture me?!

539
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:51,600
- You have failed.
- No, Unicron!

540
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:56,400
Ultra Magnus is dead
and the matrix destroyed.

541
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,880
The matrix...
has not been destroyed.

542
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:06,160
And Ultra Magnus lives
on the planet of junk.

543
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:10,200
Stalk him. Tear him apart.

544
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,440
And destroy the matrix.

545
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,800
Be sure the fittings
are securely welded.

546
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,280
Absolutely, positively
definitely,

547
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,680
I wouldn't do it
any other way!

548
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,240
Wow! This exo-suit's fantastic!

549
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,320
I think I'm starting to
get the hang of it.

550
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,160
Decepticons!

551
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,600
We've got to draw them off
and double back to the shuttle.

552
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,480
There goes the shuttle!

553
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,680
What do I do?!

554
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,440
Transform! Transform! You can
do it, I know you can do it!

555
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:13,960
Transform!

556
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,600
Human germ!

557
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,360
Transform!

558
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,480
Yeah!

559
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,320
There they are. Attack!

560
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,520
Make a break for cover.

561
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,840
I'll try to unleash
the power of the matrix.

562
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,960
Till all are one!

563
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,080
Till all are one!

564
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,760
Open, damn it, open!

565
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,640
Prime, you said the matrix
would light our darkest hour.

566
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,640
Magnus! I want the matrix!

567
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,800
Never!

568
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,920
Sweeps, terminate him!

569
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,240
Ah!

570
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,880
Die!

571
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,400
Die!

572
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,920
Unicron, my master,

573
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:38,560
with this I shall
make you my slave.

574
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,200
Before his imperial magistrate
delivers a verdict

575
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,800
would you like to
beg for your lives?

576
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:52,080
It sometimes helps,
but not often.

577
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,960
I can't transform.

578
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,240
Keep trying.

579
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,280
Silence or you will be held
in contempt of this court!

580
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,960
I have nothing but contempt
for this court.

581
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,960
Guilty or innocent?

582
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,080
Innocent.

583
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,040
They've got more sharkticons
than we have photon charges.

584
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,160
Then let's hold
a demolition derby.

585
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:10,080
Didn't even bend a fender!

586
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,720
Yeah, but look,
there are a lot more

587
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,360
of those can-diggin',
grill-crackin' things!

588
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,200
We can't hold out forever, Kup,

589
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:25,400
but we can give them
one humungous repair bill!

590
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,120
Execute them!

591
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,480
Excuse me!

592
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:59,240
Me Grimlock want to munch metal.

593
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:26,640
I never thought I'd be
so happy to see those big bozos!

594
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,680
Me Grimlock no bozo!

595
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,000
Me king!

596
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,520
Sharkticons, execute them!

597
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,920
Me Grimlock say execute them!

598
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,280
I think the problems
on this planet

599
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,160
will be solved very shortly.

600
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,400
Yeah, but what about
our problems? We need a ship.

601
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,160
You get ship if I get trip!

602
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,480
Who are you?

603
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,080
Him Wheelie.

604
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,960
Him friend!

605
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:03,360
He'll be mine too
if he can find a ship.

606
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,560
Give stare over there.

607
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,080
That's a ship?

608
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,440
Who cares, as long as it flies.

609
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,960
Ultra Magnus!

610
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,600
Without the matrix there is no
hope, no, hope, no hope at all.

611
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,760
First Prime, now Ultra Magnus.
What'll we do?

612
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,920
- Look!
Don't look behind

613
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,520
door number 2, Monty!

614
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:37,840
It's time to play
end of the line, my valentine.

615
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:41,840
Geroni-do-ron-ron-ronimo!

616
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,560
It's not hard
to knock 'em down,

617
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:18,760
it's getting 'em to stay down
that's the trick.

618
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,280
They're indestructible!
And they're everywhere!

619
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,960
You check in
but you don't check out.

620
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:27,080
Steady as she goes, bob.

621
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:30,240
Snooping visitors getting mud in
the eye, by and by. Film at 11.

622
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:38,480
It's Hotrod!

623
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,480
And Kup and the dinobots!

624
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,960
Guns aren't exactly friendly.

625
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,560
Neither are they,
in case you haven't noticed.

626
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:51,080
What was that universal greeting
again? Never mind, I remember.

627
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:55,000
Baa weep grahna
weep ninny bong!

628
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:58,200
Baa weep grahna
weep ninny bong?

629
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:01,080
Baa weep grahna
weep ninny bong.

630
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:04,440
Baa weep grahna
weep ninny bong!

631
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,440
Baa weep grahna
weep ninny bong!

632
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:31,480
Ugh! Me Grimlock not kisser!

633
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,280
Me Grimlock king!

634
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:39,280
Have a nice day! Please close
cover before striking, friends!

635
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:42,920
...so say the Junkions!

636
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,560
Where'd you learn
to talk like that?

637
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:49,040
TV. We talk TV.
You talk some TV?

638
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:53,000
I talk some TV-- and now
the news, don't touch that dial.

639
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,560
By George, Kemo Sabes,

640
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:00,400
your smashed-up friend soon like
brand-new with 90-day warranty.

641
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:13,520
Happy motoring!
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

642
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,520
Look, he's alive!

643
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,440
He's alive, I don't believe it!

644
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,280
You're... all alive.

645
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,840
The matrix...

646
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,440
has gone

647
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,200
and with it all hope.

648
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,440
- No!
- Galvatron has it!

649
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,280
Where's Galvatron? Where is he?

650
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:37,200
And the answer is...

651
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,440
Unicron!

652
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,840
Then we've got to
destroy Unicron.

653
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,640
Yes, friends,
and now destroy Unicron.

654
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,160
Kill the grand poobah!

655
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:47,960
Eliminate even
the toughest stain.

656
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,760
Help us, home us.
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

657
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,360
Sale must end.
Rush right on down

658
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,840
and test-drive latest model
with no obligation.

659
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,600
New, improved Junkion planet
is sleek, sexy import

660
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:01,640
with turbo handling!

661
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:13,840
Yeah, destroy Unicron!
Kill the grand poobah!

662
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,200
Eliminate even
the toughest stains!

663
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:17,640
Destroy Unicron...!

664
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,400
Unicron!

665
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,440
Unicron, answer me!

666
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,000
See this? The matrix!

667
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:41,920
I now possess
that which you most fear.

668
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:48,560
You will do my bidding
or taste my wrath.

669
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:57,200
You underestimate me, Galvatron.

670
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,080
For a time...

671
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:48,160
I considered sparing

672
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,920
your wretched
little planet, Cybertron.

673
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,920
But now...

674
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,440
you shall witness...
its dismemberment!

675
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:59,000
No!

676
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:09,000
Decepticons, we're under attack!

677
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,320
Scramble!

678
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:50,120
I don't believe it.

679
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:52,320
Doesn't this remind you
of anything, Kup?

680
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,520
No.

681
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,760
I've never seen
anything like this before.

682
01:06:55,840 --> 01:07:00,120
What happened to Moonbase Two?
Where's my dad?!

683
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,240
That's what
we're gonna find out.

684
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:10,920
Framed in enamel!

685
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,440
Resists fire, rain and corrosion
for up to 5 years.

686
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:15,360
Satisfaction guaranteed.

687
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,000
Or your money back!

688
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:45,920
- Where's Hotrod?
- I don't know.

689
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:48,040
But I hope they didn't get him!

690
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,360
Quick, this way!

691
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:30,000
The matrix!

692
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:33,240
It will do you no good, autobot.
It cannot be opened.

693
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:35,800
Not by a decepticon.

694
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:40,080
Like it or not, we are allies
now against a common foe.

695
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:42,520
Ah!

696
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:46,000
Destroy him, Galvatron.
Now!

697
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:48,640
Or you yourself
shall be obliterated.

698
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,760
Of course, my master!

699
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:10,320
Puny autobot,
you lack even Prime's courage!

700
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,360
Me Grimlock kick butt!

701
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:47,840
Me Grimlock need new strategy.

702
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,480
Help!

703
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:00,520
Help!

704
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:01,760
Daniel!

705
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,800
Arcee! Kup!

706
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:58,680
Dad!

707
01:10:58,760 --> 01:10:59,960
Daniel!

708
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:01,640
Dad, what can I do?!

709
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,640
Knock down the acid cover!

710
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:04,640
How?!

711
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,040
Blast it, son!

712
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,560
But I don't have a gun!

713
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,480
Use your exo-suit!

714
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:13,720
Hurry!

715
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:21,320
Dad!

716
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,080
Daniel! You did it!

717
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,440
Yeah! I did it!

718
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,880
Come out, autobot!

719
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:41,000
We all must die sometime.

720
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:43,120
Not today, Galvatron!

721
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:23,600
I will crush you
with my bare hands.

722
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,960
Die autobot!

723
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,960
First Prime,

724
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:48,760
then Ultra Magnus

725
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,440
and now... you.

726
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:55,200
It's a pity
you autobots die so easily

727
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:59,400
or I might have
a sense of satisfaction now.

728
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,760
Arise, Rodimus Prime.

729
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,520
Optimus...

730
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,280
no!

731
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:26,840
This is the end of the road,
Galvatron.

732
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:36,200
Ah!

733
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:49,680
Now light our darkest hour.

734
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,160
Spike! Daniel!

735
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:36,080
Springer, what's going on?!

736
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:39,440
No time to answer that now -
let's get out of here!

737
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:45,160
Look!

738
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:53,080
Autobots,
transform and roll out!

739
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:00,800
I knew you had potential, lad.

740
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,760
Destiny!

741
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,600
You cannot...

742
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:31,200
destroy...

743
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,120
my...

744
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,840
destiny!

745
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:49,600
Let this mark the end
of the Cybertronian Wars

746
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:53,600
as we march forward to a new age
of peace and happiness!

747
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:55,440
Till all are one!

748
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,360
Till all are one!

749
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,520
Till all are one!

750
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,640
Till all are one!
