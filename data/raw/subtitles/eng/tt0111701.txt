1
00:00:22,454 --> 00:00:25,289
Dear Henry,

2
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:30,290
all I can think about
is white fang and Alaska.

3
00:00:30,295 --> 00:00:33,325
Alex, belinda, and I continue
the repairs on the hotel

4
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:35,261
and will reopen soon.

5
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:37,566
I apologize again
for leaving you in the lurch,

6
00:00:37,568 --> 00:00:40,738
but after seeing the destruction
caused by the earthquake,

7
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:44,337
I now understand why they
were so desperate for my help.

8
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,310
In truth, though,
my heart is with white fang,

9
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:50,079
and I will return to the claim
as soon as possible.

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,478
Thanks again
for taking care of him.

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,048
Or is he taking care of you?

12
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:57,049
By the time this letter
reaches you,

13
00:00:57,051 --> 00:00:58,451
the ice will have thawed,

14
00:00:58,452 --> 00:01:01,292
and you will have survived
your first Alaskan winter.

15
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:03,318
Did you stand it all right?

16
00:01:07,327 --> 00:01:10,587
Spring is a great time
for adventures with white fang.

17
00:01:10,596 --> 00:01:12,726
Let him run, Henry.
Let him guide you.

18
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:15,061
He always knows the way.

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,430
Your friend, Jack.

20
00:02:08,648 --> 00:02:11,316
White fang!

21
00:02:20,758 --> 00:02:22,818
White fang!

22
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:24,826
Wait up, boy.

23
00:02:24,828 --> 00:02:27,398
White fang.

24
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,570
Sorry, boy.

25
00:03:57,576 --> 00:04:00,976
I guess
it's potatoes again tonight.

26
00:04:07,918 --> 00:04:10,488
Come on, boy. Come on.

27
00:04:18,427 --> 00:04:20,557
Hey, white fang.

28
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,765
Come on, get a drink.

29
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,039
Hey! You lookin' for somethin'?

30
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,641
Heh, hey! Howdy-hey, there, boy.

31
00:05:13,643 --> 00:05:15,677
Name is halverson,

32
00:05:15,678 --> 00:05:18,878
Lloyd halverson. Ha ha.

33
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:19,981
I-I hate the name,

34
00:05:19,982 --> 00:05:23,951
so you can just
use what you like.

35
00:05:23,952 --> 00:05:26,920
Now, the, uh, wolf here,

36
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:28,821
I recollect him vividly.

37
00:05:28,822 --> 00:05:32,357
I don't believe
I know you, though.

38
00:05:32,358 --> 00:05:34,888
Where's, uh...
Where's the other boy?

39
00:05:34,893 --> 00:05:37,561
Uh, what's-his-name?

40
00:05:37,562 --> 00:05:41,062
You tell me.

41
00:05:41,065 --> 00:05:44,525
Jack. Hey?

42
00:05:44,535 --> 00:05:48,435
Jack, uh... Conroy.

43
00:05:48,438 --> 00:05:50,498
Right, huh? Jack Conroy?

44
00:05:50,506 --> 00:05:53,506
Always did have me a...

45
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:54,976
Mind for names,

46
00:05:54,977 --> 00:05:56,707
all the good it done me.

47
00:05:56,712 --> 00:05:58,950
Jack went back to San Francisco

48
00:05:58,951 --> 00:06:00,747
about a year ago this time.

49
00:06:00,748 --> 00:06:03,416
Is he, uh... He your brother?

50
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:05,877
Friend.

51
00:06:05,886 --> 00:06:09,686
He left me
in charge of his claim.

52
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:12,359
Yeah, me and Jack,
we, uh, set a spell.

53
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,818
What, uh, two, three years back,

54
00:06:13,826 --> 00:06:16,086
when I was passin' through.

55
00:06:16,094 --> 00:06:18,361
I been west of here.

56
00:06:18,362 --> 00:06:20,629
Bellied up at least
a dozen digs.

57
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,760
The whole country's been...

58
00:06:22,765 --> 00:06:24,895
Picked clean.

59
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,930
Sad to see.

60
00:06:26,935 --> 00:06:28,495
What's your name?

61
00:06:28,503 --> 00:06:30,570
Henry.

62
00:06:30,571 --> 00:06:32,071
Henry Casey.

63
00:06:32,072 --> 00:06:34,072
You, uh...

64
00:06:34,074 --> 00:06:37,476
You here all by yourself? Hmm?

65
00:06:37,477 --> 00:06:40,607
Well, Henry.

66
00:06:40,613 --> 00:06:43,413
How do I know you ain't killed
that other boy

67
00:06:43,415 --> 00:06:46,375
and just took over yourself?

68
00:06:47,818 --> 00:06:49,448
Move on, mister!

69
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:51,090
No! Hold on, boy, hold on.
I never...

70
00:06:51,091 --> 00:06:53,087
Hold your water.
I'm... I'm leavin'.

71
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:56,019
Get out of here!

72
00:06:56,025 --> 00:06:59,625
- Get a hold of him!
- He does what he wants.

73
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:01,688
Just don't move real fast.

74
00:07:53,413 --> 00:07:55,680
I know what you're thinkin'.

75
00:07:55,681 --> 00:07:58,821
You're thinking how
you're gonna spend your share.

76
00:07:58,822 --> 00:07:59,917
Am I right?

77
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,589
My little pals...

78
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,520
Too many of you.

79
00:08:42,525 --> 00:08:46,455
Got to get you to Dawson...
Soon.

80
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,510
What is it, boy?

81
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:25,556
Damn!

82
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:05,529
Aah!

83
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:20,579
Down boy! Down!

84
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,549
Aah!

85
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:33,124
Get this trap
off my butt, boy...

86
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,555
Or shoot me where I lie.

87
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,097
Ah-ah-ah...

88
00:10:42,098 --> 00:10:43,598
Oh!

89
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:48,767
There'll be more comin' through.

90
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,700
Got to get that gold to a bank.

91
00:10:50,705 --> 00:10:52,965
Oh!

92
00:10:52,973 --> 00:10:56,342
What do ya say we...
Drag out that raft?

93
00:10:56,343 --> 00:10:58,877
Float on into Dawson?

94
00:10:58,878 --> 00:11:02,308
We need supplies.

95
00:11:02,314 --> 00:11:04,748
You up for it?

96
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,646
Okay.

97
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:09,851
We leave in the morning.

98
00:11:57,163 --> 00:11:59,903
On earth as it is in heaven.

99
00:11:59,904 --> 00:12:02,199
Give us this day
our daily bread,

100
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:04,131
and forgive us our...

101
00:12:09,073 --> 00:12:11,913
I mourn the passing
of your father, Moses.

102
00:12:11,914 --> 00:12:14,909
I'll pray for you
in your time of need.

103
00:12:14,912 --> 00:12:18,648
Thank you for sharing your food.
I'll return the favor.

104
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:21,179
We expect nothing
in return, God-man.

105
00:12:21,184 --> 00:12:23,184
Get away from there. Come on.

106
00:12:23,186 --> 00:12:25,646
Go, go, go.

107
00:12:27,056 --> 00:12:30,856
- No, no.
- To refuse is an insult.

108
00:12:37,231 --> 00:12:39,831
There is something of yours
I want.

109
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:44,069
Your soul, Moses. Your soul.

110
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,400
Safe trip back.

111
00:12:46,405 --> 00:12:49,365
You wonder
why God's punishing you?

112
00:12:49,374 --> 00:12:51,814
We've done nothing
to anger your God.

113
00:12:51,815 --> 00:12:54,739
And yet your people
are starving.

114
00:12:54,745 --> 00:12:56,845
There must be a reason for that.

115
00:12:56,847 --> 00:12:58,907
My grandfather
spoke often of the time

116
00:12:58,915 --> 00:13:01,175
when the caribou
would disappear,

117
00:13:01,183 --> 00:13:02,952
a time when the thunder
in the earth

118
00:13:02,953 --> 00:13:05,951
would be followed
by the coming of the wolf.

119
00:13:05,954 --> 00:13:08,754
If we are patient,

120
00:13:08,756 --> 00:13:11,756
we will be instructed
how to restore the balance.

121
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,459
These are stories, Moses.

122
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,396
You cannot live your life
by that.

123
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:22,167
In your book, there are stories.

124
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:25,137
If you care for your people,

125
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:28,268
you'll take them to live with
your relatives on the island.

126
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:33,878
You wear the same collar
as the one before you,

127
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,437
but your words are hollow.

128
00:13:36,446 --> 00:13:40,406
Reverend Michael
underestimated the situation.

129
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,516
Why let this suffering continue?

130
00:13:42,518 --> 00:13:45,988
Move your people
before it's too late.

131
00:13:48,022 --> 00:13:49,862
It is good you have a concern.

132
00:13:51,825 --> 00:13:54,085
Thank you.

133
00:15:28,314 --> 00:15:30,948
Lily.

134
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:32,279
Lily.

135
00:15:33,984 --> 00:15:38,187
You came to me in my dream,
you and the wolf.

136
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:41,418
You showed me the way.

137
00:15:41,424 --> 00:15:43,164
You will leave in the morning.

138
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:49,430
- Where am I going, Uncle?
- To bring back the wolf.

139
00:15:49,431 --> 00:15:52,101
He will lead us to the caribou.

140
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:57,235
- Where will I look?
- He'll find you.

141
00:16:11,384 --> 00:16:14,084
Come on, boy. Boat's sailin'.

142
00:16:16,221 --> 00:16:18,188
Come on.

143
00:16:18,189 --> 00:16:22,389
What is it?

144
00:16:22,392 --> 00:16:24,326
It's safe.

145
00:16:24,327 --> 00:16:25,687
Look.

146
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,560
Don't you want to go?

147
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,400
Come on, boy.

148
00:16:40,405 --> 00:16:43,265
Come on, boy. Come on.

149
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:47,039
Good boy.

150
00:16:47,044 --> 00:16:49,344
Relax. Relax.

151
00:16:49,346 --> 00:16:51,576
This is the easy part.

152
00:16:56,218 --> 00:16:58,986
When the sun burst
across the horizon,

153
00:16:58,987 --> 00:17:01,347
it swept away the dark.

154
00:17:01,356 --> 00:17:04,216
That's when ice woman,
your namesake,

155
00:17:04,225 --> 00:17:07,685
led her people away from the ice
that crushed the villages.

156
00:17:07,695 --> 00:17:09,555
This is her crest.

157
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:13,263
It will shield you from danger.

158
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:16,226
Don't be fooled by what you see.

159
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:19,035
The wolf is a powerful being.

160
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:21,467
He might not be visible to you.

161
00:17:21,472 --> 00:17:24,772
He can change shape.

162
00:17:24,775 --> 00:17:28,105
He might not be a wolf.

163
00:17:28,111 --> 00:17:30,479
When I do find the wolf,

164
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,480
what should I do with it?

165
00:17:32,482 --> 00:17:35,022
You will know.

166
00:17:56,469 --> 00:17:59,639
Hold on, boy. It'll be okay.

167
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,379
This look familiar, white fang?

168
00:18:16,252 --> 00:18:18,586
The water seems high.

169
00:18:18,587 --> 00:18:21,247
Movin' right along, boy.

170
00:18:29,363 --> 00:18:32,063
Hang on, boy!

171
00:18:59,489 --> 00:19:02,389
Stay low! Stay low, white fang!

172
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:17,168
Ohh! Oh! Hang on! Hang on.

173
00:19:27,312 --> 00:19:29,652
Hang on.

174
00:19:36,186 --> 00:19:37,846
White fang!

175
00:19:52,134 --> 00:19:54,334
White fang!

176
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:59,369
White fang!

177
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:27,610
Who are you?

178
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:30,481
Lily.

179
00:25:30,482 --> 00:25:32,882
Where are we goin'?

180
00:25:32,884 --> 00:25:35,724
To my village.

181
00:25:39,055 --> 00:25:41,545
Did you see a wolf?

182
00:25:44,859 --> 00:25:48,528
Did he go in the water?

183
00:25:48,529 --> 00:25:52,929
Did he come back up?

184
00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:55,773
Where is he?

185
00:25:57,904 --> 00:26:00,004
Me?

186
00:26:02,074 --> 00:26:07,144
I don't understand. Um...

187
00:26:07,145 --> 00:26:09,975
Did he... Did he get out?

188
00:26:21,592 --> 00:26:24,062
White fang.

189
00:26:31,901 --> 00:26:35,069
My gold. I lost my gold.

190
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,537
Sit down.

191
00:26:36,538 --> 00:26:38,038
No, no, no!
We have to go... go back!

192
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:40,669
- Be still!
- It's got to be somewhere

193
00:26:40,674 --> 00:26:43,074
in this damn river!

194
00:26:46,545 --> 00:26:49,675
I have nothing left.

195
00:26:57,988 --> 00:27:01,118
She's here! She's arriving!

196
00:27:03,626 --> 00:27:07,286
To the water!
The canoe is arriving!

197
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,666
What's that all about?

198
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,797
You.

199
00:28:00,944 --> 00:28:02,944
Wait!

200
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,128
Who is this, lily?

201
00:28:21,129 --> 00:28:23,259
This is the one, Uncle.

202
00:28:23,264 --> 00:28:25,431
This boy.

203
00:28:25,432 --> 00:28:27,432
I saw the change.

204
00:28:27,434 --> 00:28:31,270
The wolf went under the water.
The boy came back up.

205
00:28:31,271 --> 00:28:33,341
No, no, now, wait just a minute.

206
00:28:33,342 --> 00:28:36,169
No one changed into anything.

207
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:39,805
The wolf was my friend.
I lived with him.

208
00:28:39,811 --> 00:28:43,911
And I lost him in the river.

209
00:28:43,915 --> 00:28:45,405
You live with the wolf?

210
00:28:45,416 --> 00:28:48,376
Yes, sir.

211
00:28:51,754 --> 00:28:54,154
This is very good.

212
00:28:54,156 --> 00:28:56,316
Welcome to our village.

213
00:28:56,324 --> 00:29:00,327
I am Moses Joseph,
chief of the haidas.

214
00:29:00,328 --> 00:29:03,897
Henry Casey, San Francisco.

215
00:29:03,898 --> 00:29:06,328
Henry Casey.

216
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:09,868
Casey Henry.

217
00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:11,869
Funny name.

218
00:29:11,871 --> 00:29:13,371
Thank you.

219
00:29:13,372 --> 00:29:16,142
Come.

220
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:42,288
At the time of my
grandfather's grandfather,

221
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:46,059
our mother, the earth, shook,

222
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,890
and part of the Mountain

223
00:30:47,895 --> 00:30:51,255
you call devil's thumb
broke off.

224
00:30:51,265 --> 00:30:55,925
Many of our people died,
but in return,

225
00:30:55,936 --> 00:30:58,596
the creator gave us the caribou.

226
00:30:58,605 --> 00:31:03,235
Each year they come to us
from devil's thumb.

227
00:31:03,242 --> 00:31:06,377
For this reason,
we respect the Mountain

228
00:31:06,378 --> 00:31:08,878
and do not go there.

229
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,980
For two years now,
the caribou have not returned.

230
00:31:13,984 --> 00:31:16,118
Eight hunters went to find them.

231
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:18,249
They, too, have vanished.

232
00:31:18,254 --> 00:31:21,389
Without the caribou...

233
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:25,090
The balance in our lives
is gone.

234
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:28,193
Without this balance...

235
00:31:28,196 --> 00:31:30,596
My people...

236
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:32,428
Slowly starve,

237
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:37,069
die, move away.

238
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:41,339
If my dream showed me
the way of this God-man,

239
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,540
I would ask my people to move.

240
00:31:44,543 --> 00:31:49,179
But the dream
told of the wolf...

241
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,010
That would lead us
to the caribou.

242
00:31:52,016 --> 00:31:55,346
And now, Henry Casey,
you are here.

243
00:31:58,421 --> 00:31:59,491
Me?

244
00:32:03,892 --> 00:32:05,892
Got the wrong man, sir.

245
00:32:05,894 --> 00:32:09,096
I'm not much of a hunter.

246
00:32:09,097 --> 00:32:11,097
I'm more of a miner.

247
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:16,067
That is very interesting.

248
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:18,899
Really?

249
00:32:21,908 --> 00:32:24,208
That wolf your niece
saw me with...

250
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:27,210
Was a pet.

251
00:32:27,213 --> 00:32:32,116
He's the hunter.

252
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:35,147
He was something.

253
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,420
But he's gone now.

254
00:32:37,421 --> 00:32:40,389
He could be alive inside you.

255
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:42,020
The wolf has
the power to change.

256
00:32:42,024 --> 00:32:45,124
Into me?

257
00:32:47,094 --> 00:32:51,263
I guess that's okay
to believe, sir,

258
00:32:51,264 --> 00:32:54,534
but I don't.

259
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:58,702
I'm no wolf.

260
00:32:58,703 --> 00:33:01,203
I'm a man.

261
00:33:05,309 --> 00:33:07,109
That's all.

262
00:33:26,661 --> 00:33:29,961
This boy is free to leave
when he wishes.

263
00:33:34,034 --> 00:33:35,534
Thank you.

264
00:33:35,535 --> 00:33:37,295
I need supplies.

265
00:33:37,303 --> 00:33:40,041
I need to wire San Francisco
for some money.

266
00:33:40,042 --> 00:33:42,109
There must be a town near here.

267
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:45,437
When you are ready,
we can show you the way.

268
00:33:45,443 --> 00:33:48,243
If it's all right with you,
I'll stay here tonight.

269
00:33:48,245 --> 00:33:51,205
I'll leave in the morning.
Good idea.

270
00:33:51,214 --> 00:33:54,349
Katrin can show you
where to lay down.

271
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,580
Sleep now, Casey Henry.

272
00:33:58,553 --> 00:34:02,123
We can talk again tomorrow.
Okay.

273
00:34:03,756 --> 00:34:07,216
He's a nice old guy, huh?

274
00:34:09,293 --> 00:34:11,727
Old guy is my father.

275
00:34:11,728 --> 00:34:16,098
Who are you in his house?
I didn't mean anything.

276
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:18,499
Henry, this way.

277
00:34:34,683 --> 00:34:37,323
White fang.

278
00:34:42,689 --> 00:34:46,589
I should have known.
You don't see.

279
00:34:46,592 --> 00:34:49,692
I didn't ask you
to bring me here.

280
00:34:51,662 --> 00:34:54,196
I sang the healing song for you.

281
00:34:54,197 --> 00:34:56,427
What's that supposed to mean?

282
00:34:56,432 --> 00:34:59,132
I gave you back your life.

283
00:35:03,171 --> 00:35:05,571
Do you believe that stuff?

284
00:35:08,709 --> 00:35:11,209
All you believe in is your gold.

285
00:35:14,214 --> 00:35:17,484
I'm grateful
what you did for me.

286
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:24,147
But I'm not gonna go
to some godforsaken place

287
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:25,316
to hunt caribou.

288
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,623
We thought you were the wolf.

289
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,160
Sorry.

290
00:35:32,162 --> 00:35:36,431
The wolf is a great hunter
with a warrior's heart.

291
00:35:36,432 --> 00:35:40,432
You are like every other
white man.

292
00:35:59,621 --> 00:36:02,189
Follow the river.

293
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:04,490
Before dark,
you will come to it.

294
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,170
- Major.
- You shouldn't be here.

295
00:36:56,175 --> 00:36:57,535
Sir, we thought
you should know...

296
00:36:57,543 --> 00:36:59,683
I told you not to...

297
00:37:02,247 --> 00:37:03,447
- Follow me.
- Yes, sir.

298
00:37:03,448 --> 00:37:06,148
- Hyah!
- Let's go. Hyah!

299
00:37:26,269 --> 00:37:27,736
Morning there, John.

300
00:37:27,737 --> 00:37:29,697
Hi, there.

301
00:37:43,251 --> 00:37:46,351
I figured the best thing
to do is just keep movin'.

302
00:37:46,354 --> 00:37:48,194
At least I wouldn't be eatin'
their food.

303
00:37:50,324 --> 00:37:53,459
Then lily...

304
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,460
The Indian girl...

305
00:37:56,463 --> 00:38:00,432
She walked me to the stream
and pointed me here.

306
00:38:00,433 --> 00:38:03,501
Why didn't you stay
and help them?

307
00:38:03,502 --> 00:38:06,502
Why? I'll tell you why.

308
00:38:06,505 --> 00:38:08,565
You're Indian, right?

309
00:38:11,576 --> 00:38:12,936
I thought so.

310
00:38:12,944 --> 00:38:14,514
So you probably understand them

311
00:38:14,515 --> 00:38:16,312
a bit better than I do.

312
00:38:16,313 --> 00:38:19,513
They believe...
S-strange things up there,

313
00:38:19,516 --> 00:38:22,516
like their dreams.

314
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:24,589
They need help.

315
00:38:26,689 --> 00:38:29,719
I thought I saw some soldiers
while I was comin' in.

316
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:32,385
Where are they quartered?

317
00:38:32,394 --> 00:38:34,261
The army's in Dawson.

318
00:38:34,262 --> 00:38:37,831
Mm-mm. No, I just saw them.

319
00:38:37,832 --> 00:38:42,701
You just saw somebody
passin' through.

320
00:38:42,702 --> 00:38:45,302
So now you'll go home...

321
00:38:45,304 --> 00:38:47,704
And forget these people
who helped you.

322
00:38:50,275 --> 00:38:52,705
If I thought
I could help them, I would.

323
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,540
They think you can.

324
00:38:54,545 --> 00:38:57,505
They think I'm the white wolf.

325
00:38:57,514 --> 00:39:00,954
Maybe you are.

326
00:39:20,434 --> 00:39:23,436
That's him, Uncle.

327
00:39:23,437 --> 00:39:24,767
That's the wolf.

328
00:39:26,472 --> 00:39:28,572
The other half...

329
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:31,309
It's a good sign.

330
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:33,640
Good sign.

331
00:40:02,373 --> 00:40:04,407
Don't be afraid, my brother.

332
00:40:04,408 --> 00:40:06,438
Don't be afraid.

333
00:41:21,648 --> 00:41:23,878
Sad, isn't it?

334
00:43:20,192 --> 00:43:23,732
I'm goin' back.

335
00:44:07,033 --> 00:44:10,668
Gentlemen.

336
00:44:10,669 --> 00:44:12,899
Was there any mail
for me yesterday, Mr. hale?

337
00:44:12,904 --> 00:44:15,914
- One for reverend Michael.
- I'll take that.

338
00:44:15,915 --> 00:44:18,237
How long you figure?

339
00:44:18,242 --> 00:44:21,880
Telegram will be there in two,
three days at the most.

340
00:44:21,881 --> 00:44:25,378
Of course, when your money
comes back... it's another story.

341
00:44:25,381 --> 00:44:28,216
At least a week, maybe more.

342
00:44:28,217 --> 00:44:30,017
Can I get some credit?

343
00:44:30,018 --> 00:44:31,848
I'm leavin'
for the village tomorrow.

344
00:44:31,853 --> 00:44:34,253
I was hopin'
to take some food out there.

345
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:37,955
Sorry, kid... No credit.

346
00:44:37,958 --> 00:44:41,727
I'll pay for it, Mr. heath.
Give him what he wants.

347
00:44:41,728 --> 00:44:43,828
All right.

348
00:44:47,232 --> 00:44:49,166
I'm leland drury.

349
00:44:49,167 --> 00:44:53,236
- Henry Casey.
- I couldn't help but overhear.

350
00:44:53,237 --> 00:44:55,837
I go to the village often.

351
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,939
Their suffering
is hard to ignore.

352
00:44:57,941 --> 00:44:59,811
I have some mules
that know the way,

353
00:44:59,812 --> 00:45:02,209
if you'd care to use one.

354
00:45:02,211 --> 00:45:05,211
Yeah, thanks.

355
00:45:05,214 --> 00:45:09,024
You're savin' me a trip.

356
00:45:14,388 --> 00:45:16,388
Walks like a soldier.

357
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:19,820
Protestant.

358
00:47:24,016 --> 00:47:26,446
You understand the problem.
I want him out of the way.

359
00:47:26,451 --> 00:47:29,551
He is a problem now. Do it now!

360
00:47:29,554 --> 00:47:31,524
All right.

361
00:49:35,008 --> 00:49:37,708
This is for you.

362
00:49:45,249 --> 00:49:47,479
Why would I wear this?

363
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,284
I don't know, I...

364
00:49:49,285 --> 00:49:51,245
I thought it would look pretty.

365
00:49:51,253 --> 00:49:53,453
Pretty like a white girl?

366
00:49:55,389 --> 00:49:58,019
No.

367
00:49:58,024 --> 00:50:00,492
Tell you what, don't wear it.

368
00:50:00,493 --> 00:50:03,693
See if I care.
Here, give it back.

369
00:50:03,696 --> 00:50:08,426
What do I have to do?
Look, I'm here!

370
00:50:08,434 --> 00:50:10,974
And I came back
to find those caribou,

371
00:50:10,975 --> 00:50:13,169
whether you believe me or not.

372
00:50:13,171 --> 00:50:15,471
Maybe one of these days
when this is all over,

373
00:50:15,473 --> 00:50:18,043
you'll realize I'm not
as worthless as you think I am.

374
00:50:18,044 --> 00:50:20,576
Henry Casey.

375
00:50:20,577 --> 00:50:23,577
He was here looking for you.
Who was?

376
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:25,250
The wolf.

377
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:29,450
White fang?

378
00:50:29,452 --> 00:50:32,520
- He's alive?
- Yeah.

379
00:50:32,521 --> 00:50:35,021
- Are you sure it was him?
- Same wolf.

380
00:50:35,023 --> 00:50:37,457
Well, where is he?
Where'd he go?

381
00:50:37,458 --> 00:50:39,758
Be patient. He will find you.

382
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,560
Lily. Go find katrin.

383
00:50:41,561 --> 00:50:45,761
Tonight we do the ceremony.

384
00:51:15,227 --> 00:51:16,557
Mr. heath?

385
00:51:27,371 --> 00:51:29,638
He's just a boy, leland.

386
00:51:29,639 --> 00:51:32,439
That boy could ruin everything.

387
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:38,110
Do I have to do
everything myself?

388
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,793
I shouldn't be down here.

389
00:51:54,794 --> 00:51:57,334
Let the wolf inside you free.

390
00:52:52,646 --> 00:52:54,276
That's white fang.

391
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,180
Go. Go.

392
00:53:31,615 --> 00:53:33,715
White fang?

393
00:53:41,524 --> 00:53:43,794
Wait here.

394
00:53:56,804 --> 00:53:59,604
White fang?

395
00:54:01,774 --> 00:54:03,674
Is that you, boy?

396
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:11,414
White fang.

397
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:14,782
Aah!

398
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:17,652
Hah! Hah!

399
00:54:17,653 --> 00:54:18,653
Hah!

400
00:54:20,522 --> 00:54:22,292
Hyah!

401
00:54:23,891 --> 00:54:25,191
White fang!

402
00:54:37,802 --> 00:54:40,702
White fang! Come on, boy!

403
00:54:44,941 --> 00:54:47,571
You found a friend.

404
00:54:49,878 --> 00:54:52,246
Wow.

405
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:53,807
Henry Casey!

406
00:54:57,384 --> 00:54:59,384
Moses.

407
00:55:00,653 --> 00:55:02,253
Want to come, boy?

408
00:55:07,525 --> 00:55:09,655
Okay.

409
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:12,230
That's okay.

410
00:55:18,801 --> 00:55:20,968
You missed me. I knew it.

411
00:55:50,564 --> 00:55:52,534
The white wolf.

412
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:07,880
These belonged to my brother.

413
00:56:10,448 --> 00:56:13,448
For the hunt.

414
00:56:15,752 --> 00:56:17,852
I was wrong about you.

415
00:56:19,555 --> 00:56:21,715
It's okay, lily.

416
00:56:24,792 --> 00:56:27,792
Sleep well...

417
00:56:27,795 --> 00:56:29,955
White wolf.

418
00:56:32,999 --> 00:56:37,068
She likes me.

419
00:56:37,069 --> 00:56:39,699
She likes me, boy.

420
00:56:43,908 --> 00:56:46,776
This is tishlinjao.

421
00:56:46,777 --> 00:56:49,877
Devil's club juice
and saltwater.

422
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:54,516
For three days, you will fast
and drink only this.

423
00:56:54,517 --> 00:56:58,017
To hunt is a sacred act.

424
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:01,756
You must purify your body
to be worthy to kill.

425
00:57:01,757 --> 00:57:03,917
Your mind must be clear
of all else,

426
00:57:03,925 --> 00:57:06,985
no distractions.

427
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,767
You care for lily.

428
00:57:15,768 --> 00:57:18,068
Yes, sir, I do.

429
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:20,970
Lily does not yield so easily.

430
00:57:20,972 --> 00:57:22,839
She's tough.

431
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,770
All haida women are like this,

432
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:26,665
but lily learned
when she was very young.

433
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:28,676
Why's that?

434
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:30,908
Already death
has visited her three times...

435
00:57:30,913 --> 00:57:34,013
Her mother, her father,

436
00:57:34,016 --> 00:57:36,146
her brother.

437
00:57:36,151 --> 00:57:39,221
All taken by the smallpox,
white man's plague.

438
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:42,889
So lily has found her strength.

439
00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:45,658
It is out of your hands,
white wolf.

440
00:57:45,659 --> 00:57:46,889
Haida women do the choosing,

441
00:57:46,893 --> 00:57:50,161
and the sun will set
on top of my head...

442
00:57:50,162 --> 00:57:52,496
Before lily yields.

443
00:57:52,497 --> 00:57:54,157
Put her out of your mind.

444
00:57:54,165 --> 00:57:56,495
That's not gonna be so easy.

445
00:57:58,834 --> 00:58:00,634
Drink this.

446
00:58:05,239 --> 00:58:07,907
All the way.
Drink it all the way down.

447
00:58:07,908 --> 00:58:10,068
More.

448
00:58:10,076 --> 00:58:12,176
There you go.

449
00:59:06,263 --> 00:59:09,233
That's a nice shot.

450
00:59:10,266 --> 00:59:12,126
Hello!

451
00:59:12,134 --> 00:59:14,234
Who's out there?

452
00:59:17,638 --> 00:59:19,198
Who's out there?

453
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:26,710
Was that you?

454
00:59:34,786 --> 00:59:37,086
I can teach you.

455
00:59:39,022 --> 00:59:40,952
Gently.

456
00:59:44,626 --> 00:59:47,786
There's nothing else
in the world...

457
00:59:47,795 --> 00:59:50,295
But you, this arrow,
and the tree...

458
00:59:50,297 --> 00:59:54,766
And you are all one.

459
00:59:54,767 --> 00:59:56,267
Let it go.

460
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:17,618
We have the wolf.
Why do we need the boy?

461
01:00:17,619 --> 01:00:18,849
They're one and the same.

462
01:00:18,853 --> 01:00:21,621
In the dream, it was a wolf.

463
01:00:21,622 --> 01:00:24,090
- Dreams have many shapes.
- But...

464
01:00:24,091 --> 01:00:25,891
I know. I know.

465
01:00:25,892 --> 01:00:27,762
This is very hard on you, son.

466
01:00:27,763 --> 01:00:31,090
Be patient. Your time will come.

467
01:00:31,096 --> 01:00:35,026
Your time will come.

468
01:00:55,786 --> 01:00:59,086
Grandfather's bow.

469
01:01:01,623 --> 01:01:04,393
- I couldn't take this, sir.
- You will need it.

470
01:01:10,196 --> 01:01:13,126
Let Peter and lily come with me.

471
01:01:13,132 --> 01:01:15,199
Women don't hunt.

472
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,967
Why?

473
01:01:16,968 --> 01:01:19,668
Old ways.

474
01:01:21,171 --> 01:01:25,040
But Peter... can't he go?

475
01:01:25,041 --> 01:01:27,776
He's ready. You know it.

476
01:01:27,777 --> 01:01:30,207
I will speak to the holy man.

477
01:02:00,441 --> 01:02:02,711
How do I look?

478
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:46,180
You can go on the Mountain.
You can hunt.

479
01:03:01,963 --> 01:03:03,930
Uncle, in the pack,

480
01:03:03,931 --> 01:03:05,901
it is the female wolf
who runs down the caribou.

481
01:03:05,902 --> 01:03:07,329
Lily, you can't go.

482
01:03:07,333 --> 01:03:08,873
But I am better than Peter
with a bow.

483
01:03:08,874 --> 01:03:10,798
You know this.
Stop. My head aches.

484
01:03:10,803 --> 01:03:13,437
Who found the white wolf?

485
01:03:13,438 --> 01:03:15,368
He found you.

486
01:03:18,308 --> 01:03:20,038
Moses.

487
01:03:20,043 --> 01:03:24,012
What else did he see?

488
01:03:24,013 --> 01:03:26,913
One will not return.

489
01:03:30,785 --> 01:03:33,915
Where you come from
there are no women?

490
01:03:33,921 --> 01:03:35,988
We don't see them, only men.

491
01:03:35,989 --> 01:03:39,319
No, no, there's women,
beautiful women.

492
01:03:39,325 --> 01:03:41,185
They're just too soft
for livin' up here.

493
01:03:41,193 --> 01:03:44,161
- So you want a haida girl.
- I want lily.

494
01:03:44,162 --> 01:03:46,162
My cousin's a princess.

495
01:03:46,164 --> 01:03:49,900
Doesn't matter to me.

496
01:03:49,901 --> 01:03:51,968
We don't buy presents.

497
01:03:51,969 --> 01:03:54,899
If you want to tell a haida girl
you care for her,

498
01:03:54,905 --> 01:03:58,505
you come up behind her,
put your chin on her shoulder,

499
01:03:58,508 --> 01:04:01,176
and you talk softly in her ear.

500
01:04:01,177 --> 01:04:03,807
That's it?

501
01:04:03,812 --> 01:04:06,082
And she'll understand?
Or break your nose.

502
01:04:08,115 --> 01:04:10,245
You don't choose a haida woman.

503
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:13,180
She chooses you.

504
01:04:15,855 --> 01:04:17,985
Oh, man.

505
01:04:44,081 --> 01:04:46,851
A miner's pack.

506
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:56,920
My grandfather's pole.

507
01:04:56,926 --> 01:05:00,556
It tells
of a great haida chief...

508
01:05:02,830 --> 01:05:05,100
Bear clan.

509
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,400
His father, the wolf.

510
01:05:13,938 --> 01:05:16,838
Mother...

511
01:05:19,175 --> 01:05:21,975
Calm woman with fish.

512
01:05:26,581 --> 01:05:28,551
Raven...

513
01:05:30,317 --> 01:05:33,177
My father.

514
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:38,390
To be remembered by a pole
is a great honor.

515
01:05:43,228 --> 01:05:46,428
In my clan, there have been
many chiefs and warrior women.

516
01:05:46,431 --> 01:05:49,599
I carry all of them
inside of me,

517
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,500
even those yet to be born.

518
01:05:52,502 --> 01:05:54,502
And they carry me.

519
01:05:57,139 --> 01:06:00,639
We belong only to each other.

520
01:06:00,642 --> 01:06:04,077
And no one can take that
away from us.

521
01:06:04,078 --> 01:06:06,446
Do you understand?

522
01:06:06,447 --> 01:06:10,247
Since I've been here,
I've even felt that way myself,

523
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:13,380
you know, part of something.

524
01:06:14,954 --> 01:06:19,024
I've never felt
more at home anywhere.

525
01:06:20,458 --> 01:06:23,958
When you go back to your world,

526
01:06:23,961 --> 01:06:26,529
I hope you won't forget.

527
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:30,060
I'll never forget you, lily.

528
01:06:30,066 --> 01:06:34,066
I won't forget you, white wolf.

529
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:37,140
The river delivered you
at my feet.

530
01:06:39,573 --> 01:06:42,107
Lily...

531
01:06:42,108 --> 01:06:45,278
There's got to be a way.

532
01:06:47,312 --> 01:06:50,047
What do you want me to do?

533
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:53,216
Tell me. I'll do it.

534
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:55,617
- It's not possible.
- I want to be with you.

535
01:06:55,619 --> 01:06:59,149
- Don't talk like that.
- I want us to be together.

536
01:06:59,155 --> 01:07:02,515
I'm lily Joseph.
My grandfather was a chief.

537
01:07:02,525 --> 01:07:04,455
I will marry one of my own.

538
01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:06,590
I want to make this my home.

539
01:07:06,595 --> 01:07:08,595
I want to learn your language.

540
01:07:08,597 --> 01:07:10,697
I want to be a part of this
with you.

541
01:07:10,699 --> 01:07:12,569
- That will change.
- No, it won't.

542
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:14,467
You'll change.

543
01:07:14,468 --> 01:07:17,098
I'm not gonna change
how I feel about you.

544
01:07:17,103 --> 01:07:19,337
You'll leave.

545
01:07:19,338 --> 01:07:21,706
It's not possible.

546
01:07:21,707 --> 01:07:24,437
- Lily.
- No.

547
01:07:24,443 --> 01:07:27,443
Lily, please.

548
01:07:27,446 --> 01:07:30,046
It's not...

549
01:07:30,048 --> 01:07:33,178
Possible.

550
01:07:33,184 --> 01:07:36,224
Believe me?

551
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:43,520
Believe me.

552
01:08:28,269 --> 01:08:30,099
Get dressed, you pig.

553
01:08:30,104 --> 01:08:34,874
- What for?
- We're going to the village.

554
01:08:47,253 --> 01:08:49,587
He brought us here.

555
01:08:49,588 --> 01:08:52,888
Good sign...

556
01:08:52,891 --> 01:08:55,161
Devil's thumb.

557
01:09:00,497 --> 01:09:03,597
Beyond the Mountain,
you will find the path.

558
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:07,800
Follow it.
It will lead you to the caribou.

559
01:09:17,847 --> 01:09:21,316
Morning, Moses.

560
01:09:21,317 --> 01:09:23,747
Walk with me, Henry.

561
01:09:23,752 --> 01:09:25,419
I have some good news.

562
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:27,420
Yeah, what's that?

563
01:09:27,422 --> 01:09:29,922
Friend of mine's shipping
a load of gold to fort tongass.

564
01:09:29,924 --> 01:09:32,394
He needs someone to help
that we can trust.

565
01:09:32,395 --> 01:09:34,593
It pays $1,000.

566
01:09:34,595 --> 01:09:36,695
That's enough to get you home
and then some,

567
01:09:36,697 --> 01:09:38,657
but you have to leave today.

568
01:09:38,665 --> 01:09:42,825
I can't do that.
I gave Moses my word.

569
01:09:42,835 --> 01:09:46,635
Tomorrow white wolf
leads a hunt to devil's thumb.

570
01:09:46,638 --> 01:09:48,598
White wolf?

571
01:09:48,606 --> 01:09:50,206
Henry Casey.

572
01:09:54,311 --> 01:09:57,179
I'm losing my patience
with you, Henry.

573
01:09:57,180 --> 01:09:59,480
These people might think
you're something special,

574
01:09:59,482 --> 01:10:00,851
but I know you're not.

575
01:10:00,852 --> 01:10:03,580
Now, I'm warning you,
don't go back up that Mountain.

576
01:10:03,586 --> 01:10:05,546
Warning me?

577
01:10:05,554 --> 01:10:08,294
What kind of religion are you?

578
01:10:09,824 --> 01:10:10,961
The same as you, boy.

579
01:10:10,962 --> 01:10:12,688
I don't know who you are

580
01:10:12,693 --> 01:10:14,293
or what you want
with these people,

581
01:10:14,294 --> 01:10:16,662
but I know it ain't right.

582
01:10:16,663 --> 01:10:18,433
So why don't you
pack up your things

583
01:10:18,434 --> 01:10:19,831
and get out of here?

584
01:10:21,567 --> 01:10:24,667
Don't show off at my expense.

585
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:27,300
It'll come back and haunt you.

586
01:10:29,874 --> 01:10:31,574
I said get out of here!

587
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:46,320
I'll pray for you.

588
01:11:00,001 --> 01:11:01,931
Get the men ready.

589
01:11:01,936 --> 01:11:04,636
The boy's going up the Mountain.

590
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:18,950
I brought you food.

591
01:11:18,951 --> 01:11:20,851
Lily, I...

592
01:11:20,852 --> 01:11:23,920
you were in my dreams.

593
01:11:23,921 --> 01:11:26,391
But that is where it must stop.
Why?

594
01:11:26,392 --> 01:11:30,930
Because of who I am
and who you are.

595
01:11:32,662 --> 01:11:35,632
That is the way it is.

596
01:12:19,707 --> 01:12:21,567
Are you prepared to die?

597
01:12:21,575 --> 01:12:24,435
Nobody's gonna die.

598
01:12:24,444 --> 01:12:26,844
You must be ready.

599
01:12:26,846 --> 01:12:30,546
When I die,
I will come back as a raven,

600
01:12:30,549 --> 01:12:32,119
live in the forest
behind the village,

601
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:34,447
make so much noise,
no one will be able to sleep.

602
01:13:01,707 --> 01:13:03,037
Whoa!

603
01:13:12,048 --> 01:13:14,878
White man's tricks.

604
01:14:06,833 --> 01:14:09,803
I must cut him down.

605
01:14:22,446 --> 01:14:24,446
What is it, boy?

606
01:14:28,585 --> 01:14:30,845
Peter!

607
01:14:55,674 --> 01:14:57,774
I could always outrun a horse.

608
01:14:57,776 --> 01:14:59,606
Peter, no.

609
01:14:59,611 --> 01:15:01,979
Find the caribou.

610
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:04,210
Peter!

611
01:15:17,962 --> 01:15:19,192
Peter.

612
01:15:58,766 --> 01:16:01,026
Whoa!

613
01:16:01,034 --> 01:16:03,974
Ah... Uh...

614
01:16:20,752 --> 01:16:22,952
Uh... Uh!

615
01:16:50,013 --> 01:16:52,881
Where's Peter?

616
01:16:52,882 --> 01:16:54,716
He went that way.

617
01:16:54,717 --> 01:16:57,617
Lily, you should go get help.

618
01:16:57,619 --> 01:17:00,219
No. We stay together.

619
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:05,890
I'm goin' with him.

620
01:18:21,764 --> 01:18:25,304
You found 'em, boy,
just like Moses said.

621
01:18:38,713 --> 01:18:40,080
Look...

622
01:18:40,081 --> 01:18:43,016
That's why the caribou
haven't returned.

623
01:18:43,017 --> 01:18:45,277
That wall is blocking the pass.

624
01:18:51,891 --> 01:18:54,058
Come on.

625
01:18:54,059 --> 01:18:56,359
Let's go find out who built it.

626
01:19:15,279 --> 01:19:17,949
Oh! Aah!

627
01:19:40,366 --> 01:19:42,896
Are you okay?

628
01:19:42,901 --> 01:19:44,701
Where are we?

629
01:19:46,403 --> 01:19:49,703
Looks like the air shaft
of a mine.

630
01:19:56,445 --> 01:19:59,475
Does your family
know this is here?

631
01:19:59,481 --> 01:20:01,111
This is a gold mine, lily.

632
01:20:01,115 --> 01:20:02,845
You know what that means?

633
01:20:02,850 --> 01:20:04,750
Money.

634
01:20:04,751 --> 01:20:06,051
Lots of money.

635
01:20:06,052 --> 01:20:08,022
That's why they want to keep
you away from here.

636
01:20:10,856 --> 01:20:13,286
We got to get out of here,
get some help.

637
01:20:13,291 --> 01:20:15,461
The caribou will turn
and not come back.

638
01:20:15,462 --> 01:20:16,959
We can't help that.

639
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:18,990
We need to knock down that wall.

640
01:20:18,995 --> 01:20:22,155
- We need dynamite.
- Miners have dynamite.

641
01:21:05,134 --> 01:21:06,834
Now!

642
01:21:37,296 --> 01:21:40,196
Come on.

643
01:21:40,198 --> 01:21:42,028
The hunters.

644
01:21:44,934 --> 01:21:47,234
- This way.
- That's heath.

645
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:57,639
Come on! Get going!

646
01:22:02,649 --> 01:22:04,579
Back to work!

647
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:13,150
Stop, or I'll put a bullet
between your eyes!

648
01:22:15,625 --> 01:22:17,955
Is that you, Henry?

649
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:19,460
Whoa, whoa.

650
01:22:31,372 --> 01:22:33,239
Congratulations.

651
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:36,240
You're the first one
to get through.

652
01:22:36,243 --> 01:22:38,510
Get back!

653
01:22:38,511 --> 01:22:42,380
You sound very sinister, Henry.

654
01:22:42,381 --> 01:22:45,521
I've told you, you and I,
we have the same religion...

655
01:22:45,522 --> 01:22:46,617
Gold.

656
01:22:46,618 --> 01:22:48,418
Who are you?

657
01:22:48,419 --> 01:22:50,389
I sure as hell know
you're not a preacher.

658
01:22:50,390 --> 01:22:53,517
No. I'm just
another greedy American,

659
01:22:53,523 --> 01:22:55,357
just like yourself.

660
01:22:55,358 --> 01:22:57,388
I'm not like you.

661
01:22:57,393 --> 01:23:01,162
Oh, come on, now, Henry.

662
01:23:01,163 --> 01:23:04,203
You, if anyone,
should understand.

663
01:23:06,301 --> 01:23:08,501
All this gold.

664
01:23:10,471 --> 01:23:13,206
They aren't miners.

665
01:23:13,207 --> 01:23:15,507
They never came up here.

666
01:23:15,509 --> 01:23:17,739
- Who would it hurt?
- Who?

667
01:23:17,744 --> 01:23:19,444
You starved these people

668
01:23:19,445 --> 01:23:21,975
and stole from them
at the same time.

669
01:23:21,980 --> 01:23:24,110
That's not the way I planned it.

670
01:23:24,115 --> 01:23:25,545
I thought they'd move.

671
01:23:25,549 --> 01:23:29,049
You're sick, mister.
And you'll burn in hell.

672
01:23:29,052 --> 01:23:31,386
Harsh words, Henry.

673
01:23:31,387 --> 01:23:34,417
Very harsh words.

674
01:23:34,423 --> 01:23:38,023
But I'm not gonna let you turn
on your own people.

675
01:23:38,026 --> 01:23:40,426
I'm prepared to offer you
a piece of everything

676
01:23:40,428 --> 01:23:44,497
we take out of this mine...
From here on in.

677
01:23:44,498 --> 01:23:46,398
What do ya say?

678
01:23:46,399 --> 01:23:47,999
It's not yours to give.

679
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,700
- Well, sure it is, Henry.
- Get back!

680
01:23:51,769 --> 01:23:54,069
Do we have a deal?

681
01:23:58,675 --> 01:24:01,205
Get him!

682
01:24:01,210 --> 01:24:03,640
Get him!

683
01:24:03,645 --> 01:24:07,745
Get him!

684
01:24:46,116 --> 01:24:47,716
Come on.

685
01:24:47,717 --> 01:24:48,717
Lily!

686
01:24:48,718 --> 01:24:51,748
Go on, white wolf!

687
01:24:51,754 --> 01:24:54,624
Go! Go!

688
01:25:50,143 --> 01:25:52,878
Leland! Leland!

689
01:25:52,879 --> 01:25:54,746
Let the boy go.

690
01:25:54,747 --> 01:25:57,507
He's probably halfway
to Dawson by now to get help.

691
01:25:57,516 --> 01:26:00,246
He's got dynamite.
He'll blow the wall.

692
01:26:01,686 --> 01:26:04,546
- Get the girl.
- What?

693
01:26:04,555 --> 01:26:06,415
Get the girl!

694
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:13,460
Come with me.

695
01:26:32,481 --> 01:26:34,281
Okay.

696
01:27:12,852 --> 01:27:15,386
I got him!

697
01:27:39,542 --> 01:27:41,376
Uh!

698
01:27:41,377 --> 01:27:44,637
Aah!

699
01:27:56,456 --> 01:27:59,486
Henry! We're leaving now, Henry!

700
01:28:01,426 --> 01:28:02,986
Put her in the wagon!

701
01:28:06,731 --> 01:28:09,531
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

702
01:28:12,836 --> 01:28:17,236
Come on! Come on! Hyah! Hyah!

703
01:29:01,745 --> 01:29:03,945
Yah! Come on!

704
01:29:25,701 --> 01:29:28,069
White fang!

705
01:29:28,070 --> 01:29:30,438
White wolf!

706
01:29:30,439 --> 01:29:32,709
Peter! Wait!

707
01:29:44,385 --> 01:29:46,615
Peter!

708
01:29:48,088 --> 01:29:51,688
Where are we going?
Where are we going?

709
01:29:51,691 --> 01:29:53,961
Hyah! Hyah!

710
01:29:55,427 --> 01:29:58,727
Hyah!

711
01:30:35,032 --> 01:30:36,599
Hyah!

712
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:38,367
Hyah! Hyah!

713
01:30:38,368 --> 01:30:40,768
Hyah! Yah!

714
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:56,776
Henry!

715
01:30:58,819 --> 01:31:01,019
Untie me!

716
01:31:02,455 --> 01:31:04,755
I can't get it!

717
01:31:15,867 --> 01:31:18,667
Aah!

718
01:31:39,789 --> 01:31:41,819
That's my gold.

719
01:31:41,824 --> 01:31:44,024
That's my gold.

720
01:31:48,830 --> 01:31:51,660
Oh!

721
01:32:01,808 --> 01:32:05,638
Aah!

722
01:32:09,849 --> 01:32:13,079
Here, boy!

723
01:32:13,085 --> 01:32:16,085
White fang!

724
01:32:16,088 --> 01:32:18,118
Here, boy!

725
01:32:25,129 --> 01:32:26,459
Look.

726
01:32:29,599 --> 01:32:31,599
White fang!

727
01:33:32,725 --> 01:33:35,125
Moses.

728
01:33:35,127 --> 01:33:37,657
It's done.

729
01:33:39,830 --> 01:33:41,760
Peter.

730
01:33:43,133 --> 01:33:45,868
They couldn't catch my son.

731
01:33:45,869 --> 01:33:48,039
They shot him in the back.

732
01:33:51,740 --> 01:33:53,240
No.

733
01:33:53,241 --> 01:33:58,010
That's impossible.
He was just running with me...

734
01:33:58,011 --> 01:33:59,781
Right beside me.

735
01:34:01,981 --> 01:34:05,051
Peter loved to run.

736
01:34:17,894 --> 01:34:19,961
Sleep.

737
01:34:19,962 --> 01:34:22,029
I will watch him.

738
01:34:31,638 --> 01:34:32,968
Huh?

739
01:34:55,026 --> 01:34:56,986
Lily!

740
01:35:22,718 --> 01:35:25,748
White fang! Come here, boy.

741
01:35:25,754 --> 01:35:28,294
Come here.

742
01:35:31,726 --> 01:35:33,826
Good boy.

743
01:35:33,828 --> 01:35:36,128
Good boy. How you feelin'?

744
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:37,330
Okay?

745
01:35:54,814 --> 01:35:58,216
Thank you.

746
01:36:02,754 --> 01:36:05,424
That's Peter.

747
01:36:08,392 --> 01:36:10,392
Just like he promised.

748
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:27,007
Lily, would you stop?

749
01:36:27,008 --> 01:36:29,538
What is it? What's wrong?

750
01:36:36,116 --> 01:36:38,176
My gold.

751
01:36:39,351 --> 01:36:41,551
You found it.

752
01:36:43,421 --> 01:36:46,321
Now you can go.

753
01:36:46,323 --> 01:36:48,463
I don't want to go.

754
01:36:50,559 --> 01:36:54,228
Lily.

755
01:36:54,229 --> 01:36:55,929
Lily!

756
01:37:00,034 --> 01:37:02,068
Where will you go now?

757
01:37:02,069 --> 01:37:04,469
I don't know yet.

758
01:37:04,471 --> 01:37:06,238
Where's home?

759
01:37:06,239 --> 01:37:08,269
San Francisco.

760
01:37:08,274 --> 01:37:11,209
But there's nothing
there for me,

761
01:37:11,210 --> 01:37:12,577
not anymore.

762
01:37:12,578 --> 01:37:16,078
Nothing? Not even
for a man with gold?

763
01:37:16,081 --> 01:37:19,181
Nothing I'm interested in.

764
01:37:19,184 --> 01:37:21,384
Nothing I want.

765
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:39,100
If you see lily...

766
01:37:52,349 --> 01:37:56,279
Thank you, Moses,
for everything.

767
01:38:00,490 --> 01:38:03,420
It was you who did the giving.

768
01:38:03,426 --> 01:38:07,326
May the great spirit
and all the spirits...

769
01:38:07,329 --> 01:38:10,297
Keep you and protect you.

770
01:38:10,298 --> 01:38:13,366
You are a human being...

771
01:38:13,367 --> 01:38:16,897
Of courage and of honor.

772
01:38:16,903 --> 01:38:20,138
When we speak of you,

773
01:38:20,139 --> 01:38:22,909
it will be with pride.

774
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:40,220
Henry, come back in the spring!

775
01:39:04,679 --> 01:39:09,179
White fang! Come on, boy!

776
01:39:09,183 --> 01:39:11,017
Come on, boy!

777
01:39:16,956 --> 01:39:21,456
Let's go, boy.
Come on, let's go!

778
01:39:42,380 --> 01:39:44,450
White wolf!

779
01:39:51,087 --> 01:39:53,017
White wolf!

780
01:39:56,190 --> 01:39:59,990
White wolf...

781
01:39:59,993 --> 01:40:02,063
I choose you.

782
01:40:38,096 --> 01:40:41,626
I choose you, Henry Casey.

783
01:41:46,623 --> 01:41:49,163
Hey, white fang!
