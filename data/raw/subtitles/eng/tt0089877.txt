1
00:00:39,101 --> 00:00:42,332
No one tells me what I can do.

2
00:00:42,805 --> 00:00:44,102
Especially you.

3
00:00:44,173 --> 00:00:48,769
-I traveled all this way to--
-I can have anything I want...

4
00:00:49,345 --> 00:00:51,609
and I want that diamond...

5
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,513
the greatest diamond in all the universe.

6
00:00:55,818 --> 00:00:59,345
Let me try to explain this
just once more, Your Highness.

7
00:00:59,622 --> 00:01:02,113
If anything happens to that diamond--

8
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:04,716
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

9
00:01:09,498 --> 00:01:13,400
You are going to destroy everybody
in the whole universe.

10
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:16,927
-Take him away!
-You will destroy yourself.

11
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,400
You dare attack my power?

12
00:01:23,846 --> 00:01:26,747
You can stop me, but there are others.

13
00:01:27,516 --> 00:01:28,642
If only....

14
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,715
Where is my horse?
At least let me say goodbye to my horse.

15
00:01:40,696 --> 00:01:43,722
No one is going to stop me.

16
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:51,789
It's spring!

17
00:02:52,668 --> 00:02:55,432
Spring! It's in the air.

18
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:10,643
<i>Wake up, flowers</i>

19
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,150
<i>I've been up for hours</i>

20
00:03:14,356 --> 00:03:16,688
<i>There's work to do</i>

21
00:03:18,227 --> 00:03:21,685
<i>Birds, start flyin'</i>

22
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,765
<i>No more me-oh-myin'</i>

23
00:03:25,234 --> 00:03:27,498
<i>There's work to do</i>

24
00:03:28,971 --> 00:03:32,407
<i>Everybody's got a part to play</i>

25
00:03:32,508 --> 00:03:36,035
<i>To start each day in a beautiful way</i>

26
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:39,109
<i>Every mornin' when the night goes away</i>

27
00:03:39,248 --> 00:03:43,048
<i>Every mornin' is a brand-new day</i>

28
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:00,068
What do you take me for,
the morning bus?

29
00:04:03,205 --> 00:04:06,368
<i>Even little things</i>

30
00:04:06,642 --> 00:04:09,543
<i>Need a helping wing</i>

31
00:04:09,745 --> 00:04:12,043
<i>There's work to do</i>

32
00:04:24,593 --> 00:04:27,426
<i>Sun, start glowin'</i>

33
00:04:28,297 --> 00:04:31,095
<i>Pack away your snow things</i>

34
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:33,493
<i>There's work to do</i>

35
00:04:35,304 --> 00:04:38,273
<i>Up and at 'em</i>

36
00:04:38,507 --> 00:04:41,704
<i>You can't just hang around when</i>

37
00:04:41,977 --> 00:04:44,878
<i>There's work to do</i>

38
00:04:49,885 --> 00:04:52,854
<i>Everybody's got a part to play</i>

39
00:04:52,921 --> 00:04:56,413
<i>To start each day in a beautiful way</i>

40
00:04:56,792 --> 00:05:00,785
<i>Every mornin' when the night goes away</i>

41
00:05:01,864 --> 00:05:03,456
Good morning, Starlite.

42
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:05,257
Good morning to you all.

43
00:05:05,434 --> 00:05:08,665
<i>Every mornin' is a brand-new day</i>

44
00:05:28,957 --> 00:05:30,925
That's my job.

45
00:05:53,348 --> 00:05:54,815
Good morning.

46
00:05:54,883 --> 00:05:56,407
<i>Mornin'</i>

47
00:05:56,752 --> 00:06:00,381
<i>Rainbow Brite</i>

48
00:06:02,157 --> 00:06:06,059
<i>Feel the sunlight</i>

49
00:06:07,095 --> 00:06:09,359
<i>There's work to do</i>

50
00:06:09,431 --> 00:06:11,262
Good morning, everyone.

51
00:06:12,701 --> 00:06:15,431
It's spring, Rainbow.

52
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:20,969
I know, Twink. Thank you.
Twink, the star sprinkles.

53
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,986
Okay, let's get to work.

54
00:06:35,123 --> 00:06:38,092
<i>Everybody's got a part to play</i>

55
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,119
<i>To start each day in a beautiful way</i>

56
00:06:42,297 --> 00:06:45,061
<i>Every mornin' when the night goes away</i>

57
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:49,263
<i>Every mornin' is a rainbow day</i>

58
00:06:51,273 --> 00:06:54,208
<i>Every mornin' is a brand-new day</i>

59
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:58,536
<i>And you've got a part to play</i>

60
00:07:02,084 --> 00:07:06,418
Come on, Starlite.
Everyone on Earth is waiting for spring.

61
00:07:06,488 --> 00:07:08,513
We've got work to do.

62
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,950
Oh, boy.

63
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:50,557
Murky, hurry. It's almost spring.

64
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,267
It's never going to be spring.

65
00:07:58,473 --> 00:08:01,340
One blast from my Super Gloom Boomer...

66
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:05,403
and Rainbow Brite
will never make anything beautiful again.

67
00:08:05,881 --> 00:08:09,647
Oh, boy. Then do I get to
ride on her horsy?

68
00:08:10,786 --> 00:08:14,187
Murky, that smells terrible.

69
00:08:14,423 --> 00:08:18,189
Now, at last,
I'll be the ruler of Rainbow Land.

70
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,458
No more colors.
Nothing but gloom everywhere.

71
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:28,469
Get it, banana-brain!

72
00:08:28,904 --> 00:08:30,667
No.

73
00:08:31,807 --> 00:08:34,435
Get after it.

74
00:08:35,277 --> 00:08:36,642
Okay, Murky.

75
00:08:43,151 --> 00:08:45,551
I'm getting it, Murky.

76
00:08:52,861 --> 00:08:55,728
Don't worry, Murky. I'll get it.

77
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,268
Come back here.

78
00:09:07,042 --> 00:09:09,033
No!

79
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:16,615
Faster, snail-brain.

80
00:09:22,257 --> 00:09:24,350
Lurky!

81
00:09:36,138 --> 00:09:39,596
I wish we didn't have to go through this
every spring.

82
00:09:39,674 --> 00:09:42,700
The Earth needs the winter rain, Twink.
You know that.

83
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:44,837
Everyone knows that.

84
00:09:45,614 --> 00:09:49,050
But I think they've had enough winter
for this year.

85
00:09:52,687 --> 00:09:56,453
-Winter isn't over yet.
-Stormy, it's time for spring.

86
00:09:57,859 --> 00:10:00,259
I'm having too much fun.

87
00:10:09,204 --> 00:10:10,967
Skydancer.

88
00:10:19,648 --> 00:10:21,775
It's time for spring, Stormy.

89
00:10:24,653 --> 00:10:27,349
Stormy, things have to happen
when it's time.

90
00:10:27,422 --> 00:10:28,980
It's wintertime!

91
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,734
-Come on, Starlite. Let's catch them.
-My pleasure.

92
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,745
You'll never catch us.

93
00:10:54,082 --> 00:10:59,019
There isn't a horse in the universe
who can outrun the magnificent Starlite.

94
00:11:02,224 --> 00:11:03,589
Come on, Skydancer.

95
00:11:03,658 --> 00:11:07,150
If they catch us,
winter's over for another year.

96
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,500
Now it will be winter all year round.

97
00:11:25,914 --> 00:11:28,041
Come on, Skydancer.

98
00:11:29,784 --> 00:11:33,379
-See you in Rainbow Land.
-See you.

99
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,670
No more fun for three whole seasons.

100
00:11:59,047 --> 00:12:00,912
Long winter this year.

101
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,557
Hi, what's up?

102
00:12:22,771 --> 00:12:23,931
Rainbow.

103
00:12:24,005 --> 00:12:25,734
I could never let anything happen...

104
00:12:25,807 --> 00:12:28,002
to the only person on Earth
who can see me.

105
00:12:28,109 --> 00:12:31,476
Boy, it's about time you got here.
Look at all this snow.

106
00:12:31,646 --> 00:12:34,774
Stormy got a little carried away
this year. Twink?

107
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,528
The rainbow didn't do anything.

108
00:12:51,132 --> 00:12:54,363
Maybe the star sprinkles
are tired from the winter.

109
00:12:54,436 --> 00:12:58,031
They never got tired before.
There's something wrong.

110
00:12:58,106 --> 00:13:02,099
If spring doesn't get started soon,
flowers will die.

111
00:13:02,544 --> 00:13:04,444
The birds won't lay their eggs.

112
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:07,343
And I don't want to think
about the baseball season.

113
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:11,579
Spring's when life comes back,
when hope starts to grow again.

114
00:13:11,953 --> 00:13:15,514
All sorts of terrible things will happen
if there isn't any spring.

115
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:18,457
We'd better get back to Rainbow Land
and see what happened.

116
00:13:18,526 --> 00:13:19,857
And fast.

117
00:13:21,563 --> 00:13:23,895
Spring will be here
before you know it, Brian.

118
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:26,559
-Come on, Starlite.
-To Rainbow Land.

119
00:13:26,635 --> 00:13:29,536
I know where we have to go.
Thank you very much.

120
00:13:29,671 --> 00:13:30,968
Goodbye, Rainbow.

121
00:13:39,748 --> 00:13:42,444
There's no place like home.

122
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:47,511
Every place will be like home
as soon as I get this machine fixed.

123
00:13:50,425 --> 00:13:53,519
-No.
-Murky, you're dancing.

124
00:13:56,931 --> 00:13:58,899
Help me!

125
00:13:59,534 --> 00:14:01,229
I love dancing.

126
00:14:02,637 --> 00:14:04,070
Goody.

127
00:14:12,013 --> 00:14:15,210
-I'm coming, Murky.
-No!

128
00:14:16,584 --> 00:14:19,314
Get off me.

129
00:14:21,256 --> 00:14:22,917
Murky, look.

130
00:14:23,591 --> 00:14:25,650
It's a shooting star.

131
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:30,727
Haven't you ever seen
a shooting star before?

132
00:14:33,201 --> 00:14:35,465
Never this close before.

133
00:14:36,204 --> 00:14:38,729
Lurky, come back here.

134
00:14:43,845 --> 00:14:46,746
Stay down. It may explode.

135
00:14:47,982 --> 00:14:52,544
-Go see what it is.
-Okay, Murky. I'll go see what it is.

136
00:14:55,457 --> 00:14:57,618
It's a lot of smoke, Murky.

137
00:14:57,692 --> 00:15:00,820
Come back here, dodo-brain.

138
00:15:07,369 --> 00:15:10,566
A horsy! Take me for a ride.

139
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:12,836
Get back here.

140
00:15:14,075 --> 00:15:17,135
Goody. Boy, I get to ride a horsy.

141
00:15:20,582 --> 00:15:22,573
<i>You are Rainbow Brite?</i>

142
00:15:23,151 --> 00:15:24,812
Me? No.

143
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,946
You're looking for Rainbow Brite?

144
00:15:29,858 --> 00:15:30,882
<i>Yes.</i>

145
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,891
I'm Rainbow Brite.

146
00:15:34,429 --> 00:15:36,397
Murky, I never knew.

147
00:15:36,564 --> 00:15:39,055
Not now, bozo-brain.

148
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,897
<i>Not Rainbow Brite.</i>

149
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:48,605
See, Murky? Horsies are smart.
Can I have a ride now?

150
00:15:50,044 --> 00:15:52,877
<i>Not Rainbow Brite.</i>

151
00:15:53,381 --> 00:15:56,782
Just what do you want
with Rainbow Brite?

152
00:15:57,685 --> 00:16:00,586
<i>Deliver message about diamond.</i>

153
00:16:01,723 --> 00:16:03,588
Diamond?

154
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:09,096
It's right over that hill, my friend,
in Rainbow Land.

155
00:16:09,631 --> 00:16:13,067
Murky, you're helping Rainbow Brite?

156
00:16:13,334 --> 00:16:16,735
I'm helping us, hairball.

157
00:16:21,676 --> 00:16:25,271
You tell her all about the diamond.

158
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,344
Boy, I get to ride now.

159
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:36,748
<i>Goodbye.</i>

160
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:43,288
Hurry. We've got to get to Rainbow Land
in time to hear that horse's message.

161
00:16:43,832 --> 00:16:46,767
I'm hurrying, Murky. Boy.

162
00:16:49,671 --> 00:16:53,402
Wait, Lurky. Wait for me.

163
00:16:54,108 --> 00:16:55,598
No.

164
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,948
Am I hurrying enough for you, Murky?

165
00:17:17,298 --> 00:17:19,289
A flying horse?

166
00:17:19,634 --> 00:17:22,603
-Starlite.
-Rainbow's back.

167
00:17:30,245 --> 00:17:33,043
That's not Starlite.

168
00:17:37,552 --> 00:17:39,918
-Who's he?
-Where did he come from?

169
00:17:44,158 --> 00:17:45,989
What does he want?

170
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,167
<i>Danger, rain....</i>

171
00:18:01,976 --> 00:18:05,036
-Rain?
-It's not raining.

172
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:08,080
<i>-Rainbow Brite.</i>
-Here I am.

173
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:29,098
<i>Rain.... Danger.</i>

174
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:36,367
<i>Brite, I am On-X. Push button.</i>

175
00:18:40,081 --> 00:18:41,514
Quick.

176
00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:44,641
This'll let us hear the message, Murky?

177
00:18:44,786 --> 00:18:48,722
If you stop talking long enough
to let me listen.

178
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:52,216
<i>Danger.</i>

179
00:18:56,598 --> 00:18:58,589
<i>Spectra's in danger.</i>

180
00:18:58,666 --> 00:18:59,860
<i>Emergency.</i>

181
00:19:02,236 --> 00:19:06,502
-What's a Spectra?
-Spectra's the diamond planet.

182
00:19:06,941 --> 00:19:10,240
All the light in the universe
has to pass through it.

183
00:19:10,311 --> 00:19:13,246
Boy, Murky, I bet it's shiny.

184
00:19:13,881 --> 00:19:16,213
Not after I get done with it.

185
00:19:16,284 --> 00:19:20,050
This is my chance
to rid the universe of color forever.

186
00:19:20,188 --> 00:19:21,177
Let's go.

187
00:19:21,422 --> 00:19:25,859
Maybe we should hear
the rest of the message. Maybe....

188
00:19:25,994 --> 00:19:28,292
You come on, bubblehead.

189
00:19:28,663 --> 00:19:31,564
You want them to beat us
to that diamond?

190
00:19:36,004 --> 00:19:38,598
If something's happened
to that diamond....

191
00:19:38,706 --> 00:19:41,072
That explains what's happening on Earth.

192
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,978
<i>The universe.... Danger.</i>

193
00:19:46,014 --> 00:19:49,211
<i>The universe will die unless you hurry.</i>

194
00:19:51,786 --> 00:19:55,620
<i>Orin says only hope is Rainbow Brite.</i>

195
00:19:55,857 --> 00:19:58,724
Orin says? And just who is Orin?

196
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,520
<i>Wise one, ancient one.</i>

197
00:20:02,363 --> 00:20:04,354
The only Orin I ever heard of...

198
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:07,424
is the one that Sprites
tells stories about at bedtime.

199
00:20:07,502 --> 00:20:09,163
But he's not real.

200
00:20:11,673 --> 00:20:13,402
Yes, he is.

201
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,374
<i>Sent me to find Rainbow Brite.</i>

202
00:20:17,645 --> 00:20:20,580
<i>The universe grows darker.</i>

203
00:20:21,816 --> 00:20:23,374
I will go.

204
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,219
Rainbow.

205
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:32,216
Twink, you take care of Rainbow Land
while I'm gone.

206
00:20:32,293 --> 00:20:35,353
-Can I help, please?
-Stormy.

207
00:20:35,697 --> 00:20:39,098
I never get a chance to make things
bright and colorful.

208
00:20:45,473 --> 00:20:48,465
-Rainbow.
-Rainbow, we need you here.

209
00:20:48,543 --> 00:20:51,137
-It's spring.
-Don't you understand?

210
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:55,840
Spring will never come again
if something happens to Spectra.

211
00:20:58,653 --> 00:21:01,679
I've never been there, but it's part of me.

212
00:21:02,356 --> 00:21:04,984
It's part of the colors and the joy we bring.

213
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:08,893
And if Spectra dies,
happiness everywhere will die.

214
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:13,399
Without the light of life, we'll all....
All of us will die.

215
00:21:18,172 --> 00:21:21,699
Come on, Starlite.
We haven't got a minute to lose.

216
00:21:24,645 --> 00:21:28,308
-Goodbye, Rainbow.
-Be careful.

217
00:21:33,755 --> 00:21:37,851
And hurry, Rainbow. Please. Hurry.

218
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:50,632
Hurry up, molasses-brain,
or we'll never catch up to them.

219
00:21:51,272 --> 00:21:53,638
Yeah, I'm coming, Murky.

220
00:22:09,924 --> 00:22:14,623
Done. That diamond's going to be mine.

221
00:22:19,534 --> 00:22:21,729
Brakes, Lurky.

222
00:22:22,904 --> 00:22:25,372
Yeah. Brakes.

223
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,534
Boy, I hope that wasn't the brakes.

224
00:22:31,813 --> 00:22:35,681
-Yes. Those were the brakes.
-You....

225
00:22:44,725 --> 00:22:48,684
Let's see that Rainbow brat
beat me this time.

226
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:59,330
Next stop, Spectra.

227
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,412
No.

228
00:23:13,487 --> 00:23:17,685
-Murky.
-Up. We want to go up.

229
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:29,033
The signal isn't going through.

230
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:33,304
-There's some kind of interference.
-We have to keep trying.

231
00:23:57,798 --> 00:24:01,632
-Starlite, look.
-What a magnificent sight.

232
00:24:01,702 --> 00:24:05,331
It really does shine
with all the light in the universe.

233
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,440
But something's covering it up.

234
00:24:08,509 --> 00:24:11,569
Look. Not all the light's getting through.

235
00:24:11,946 --> 00:24:15,677
If we don't get it uncovered,
everything on Earth will die.

236
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:37,234
You missed a spot.

237
00:24:43,511 --> 00:24:45,103
You'll scratch it.

238
00:24:46,113 --> 00:24:48,673
You have no idea how hard a job this is.

239
00:24:49,216 --> 00:24:51,480
<i>Where is Orin?</i>

240
00:24:52,153 --> 00:24:54,212
Never heard of him. My name--

241
00:24:54,288 --> 00:24:58,281
I'm Bombo. Polisher first-class. This is....

242
00:25:02,196 --> 00:25:05,063
-Oh, no.
<i>-Must find Orin.</i>

243
00:25:05,132 --> 00:25:07,828
No time to talk. Work to do.

244
00:25:07,935 --> 00:25:10,165
Stop.

245
00:25:10,805 --> 00:25:12,932
We worked all day on that spot.

246
00:25:13,374 --> 00:25:15,137
There's the problem.

247
00:25:26,354 --> 00:25:28,185
Why are they doing that?

248
00:25:28,322 --> 00:25:30,517
I don't know. Not our job.

249
00:25:32,126 --> 00:25:35,254
Just doing our job. Polish, polish, polish.

250
00:25:36,163 --> 00:25:38,188
But they're shutting out the light.

251
00:25:38,265 --> 00:25:40,233
Keep it bright and shiny.

252
00:25:41,202 --> 00:25:44,365
<i>Hypnotized, no response.</i>

253
00:25:44,905 --> 00:25:48,363
And the light of Spectra
is the light of the universe.

254
00:25:48,476 --> 00:25:52,003
With that net all over everything,
the light can't get through.

255
00:25:52,313 --> 00:25:55,407
<i>Princess plans to pull Spectra</i>
<i>with spaceship.</i>

256
00:25:55,816 --> 00:25:59,445
<i>Net is for spaceship to hold on to. Orin.</i>

257
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,287
No Orin.

258
00:26:01,489 --> 00:26:02,547
<i>Krys?</i>

259
00:26:03,357 --> 00:26:04,517
Bombo.

260
00:26:06,861 --> 00:26:10,160
Popo, Bodo, Baglo,
Bonglo, Beezo, his cousin Deezo...

261
00:26:10,231 --> 00:26:13,667
Dazzo, Poonch, my brother, my sister,
my nephew, and his friend.

262
00:26:14,668 --> 00:26:16,693
No Orin.

263
00:26:17,238 --> 00:26:18,227
<i>Krys?</i>

264
00:26:20,374 --> 00:26:23,571
Things on Earth will die
if you cover up the diamond.

265
00:26:24,678 --> 00:26:27,146
Earth? What's Earth?

266
00:26:27,681 --> 00:26:32,482
It's the place I bring color to,
a beautiful place full of life.

267
00:26:32,653 --> 00:26:37,386
But it can't live without Spectra's light.
Who hypnotized them all?

268
00:26:37,591 --> 00:26:40,185
-Not me.
-Not our job.

269
00:26:40,461 --> 00:26:43,624
We have to stop them before it's too late.

270
00:26:44,698 --> 00:26:48,725
-Can't talk about it.
-I'm tired of talking myself.

271
00:26:52,506 --> 00:26:53,996
We can do it.

272
00:26:57,078 --> 00:26:59,672
Glitterbots.

273
00:27:10,324 --> 00:27:13,020
Starlite. No.

274
00:27:37,852 --> 00:27:39,376
Hide. Hurry.

275
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,343
Glitterbot.

276
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,091
<i>No Orin, find Krys.</i>

277
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:31,931
-Krys?
-Who's Krys?

278
00:28:32,306 --> 00:28:34,001
<i>Friend.</i>

279
00:28:43,184 --> 00:28:44,708
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

280
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:46,816
<i>Open.</i>

281
00:28:48,923 --> 00:28:50,288
At last.

282
00:28:58,032 --> 00:28:59,522
He's not here.

283
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,330
-But the Glitterbots are.
-No.

284
00:29:02,403 --> 00:29:03,893
<i>Emergency.</i>

285
00:29:06,207 --> 00:29:08,038
Hurry.

286
00:30:02,596 --> 00:30:06,555
-Starlite, quick.
-I will not wear booties.

287
00:30:08,402 --> 00:30:10,063
<i>Better than falling down.</i>

288
00:30:15,342 --> 00:30:17,173
My poor dignity.

289
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,917
<i>-Find Orin now?</i>
-Yes.

290
00:30:35,496 --> 00:30:38,431
Boy, Murky, that's a big diamond.

291
00:30:38,966 --> 00:30:40,729
What are we going to do with it?

292
00:30:40,801 --> 00:30:44,168
We're going to crash into it, amoeba-brain.

293
00:30:45,272 --> 00:30:46,637
Hang on.

294
00:30:47,441 --> 00:30:50,035
No. The gloom pipe.

295
00:30:52,579 --> 00:30:55,241
Stop. You're scratching it.

296
00:31:00,654 --> 00:31:05,557
Now, how do we get the diamond
onto the spaceship?

297
00:31:09,863 --> 00:31:12,855
Look what you did, you....

298
00:31:13,867 --> 00:31:16,199
I'll polish it later.

299
00:31:16,837 --> 00:31:20,864
Murky, the Super Gloom Boomer's
all ready.

300
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:24,207
Not yet, chicken-breath.

301
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:26,746
First, we're gonna find
that Rainbow Brite...

302
00:31:26,814 --> 00:31:31,274
and use it on her, whoever she is.

303
00:31:47,301 --> 00:31:48,495
<i>Danger.</i>

304
00:32:04,351 --> 00:32:09,118
Seems like the perfect moment
for a swim. Hang on.

305
00:32:12,593 --> 00:32:16,029
I can't get anywhere in this water.

306
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,024
Try.

307
00:32:20,334 --> 00:32:22,359
I'm a magnificent swimmer.

308
00:32:22,436 --> 00:32:26,497
We have to do something
or we'll get hypnotized like the Spectrans.

309
00:32:37,017 --> 00:32:38,484
Get in the boat.

310
00:32:39,887 --> 00:32:42,515
It's a chance for you, at least.

311
00:32:44,291 --> 00:32:47,749
-Hurry.
-The boat won't hold me.

312
00:32:47,828 --> 00:32:49,796
I won't leave you.

313
00:32:50,631 --> 00:32:52,656
They're getting closer.

314
00:33:01,508 --> 00:33:03,408
There are no oars.

315
00:33:04,378 --> 00:33:05,845
And no sail.

316
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,771
There's no way to make the boat go.

317
00:33:35,676 --> 00:33:38,110
I hope he knows where he's going.

318
00:33:38,645 --> 00:33:42,240
Wherever we're going,
it seems like we're going faster.

319
00:33:50,023 --> 00:33:51,456
No!

320
00:34:08,575 --> 00:34:09,872
<i>Emergency.</i>

321
00:34:14,214 --> 00:34:16,944
The rainbow can't get through this mist.

322
00:34:30,931 --> 00:34:34,662
-He saved us.
-Now let's see if he knows how to land.

323
00:34:47,848 --> 00:34:50,339
Well, we got away from the Glitterbots.

324
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:57,322
But now we've got to get back
and do something about that net.

325
00:35:02,496 --> 00:35:05,431
You think dropping a boat on me
is gonna stop me...

326
00:35:05,499 --> 00:35:09,799
you'd better think again.
Maybe I'm the last one, but I'll fight.

327
00:35:10,571 --> 00:35:11,697
<i>Krys.</i>

328
00:35:13,073 --> 00:35:15,064
On-X. Where's Orin?

329
00:35:15,309 --> 00:35:17,903
<i>Prison. Sent me for help.</i>

330
00:35:18,645 --> 00:35:20,909
<i>-Rainbow Brite.</i>
-Hi.

331
00:35:24,151 --> 00:35:26,779
This is what you call help? A girl?

332
00:35:27,287 --> 00:35:28,720
Orin's locked up someplace.

333
00:35:28,789 --> 00:35:32,156
The Glitterbots have everybody on Spectra
hypnotized but me...

334
00:35:32,225 --> 00:35:34,955
and that's only
because I can run faster than anybody.

335
00:35:35,028 --> 00:35:38,429
The Princess is wrapping the planet up
like a birthday present...

336
00:35:38,498 --> 00:35:40,432
and you bring me a girl?

337
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,990
What princess?

338
00:35:42,669 --> 00:35:45,797
The Princess. She wants to own Spectra.

339
00:35:46,306 --> 00:35:50,037
Nobody can own Spectra.
It's the life of the whole universe.

340
00:35:51,011 --> 00:35:53,479
You go and tell the Princess that.

341
00:35:53,747 --> 00:35:55,544
I guess I'll have to.

342
00:35:55,682 --> 00:35:57,877
Sure. All by yourself?

343
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:00,883
Just tell me where to find her.

344
00:36:02,723 --> 00:36:05,590
You can come with us if you're not afraid.

345
00:36:05,993 --> 00:36:08,154
I'm braver than any girl.

346
00:36:44,598 --> 00:36:49,262
Murky, how are we gonna get
this whole planet in our spaceship--

347
00:36:52,406 --> 00:36:57,309
Why don't you just go out
and tell those robots where we are?

348
00:36:58,545 --> 00:37:00,012
Okay, Murky.

349
00:37:00,414 --> 00:37:02,882
Stop, rutabaga-brain!

350
00:37:03,483 --> 00:37:07,249
Robots, we're over here.

351
00:37:08,321 --> 00:37:10,551
Here they come, Murky.

352
00:37:11,491 --> 00:37:14,858
Murky, look. A pretty rainbow.

353
00:37:15,295 --> 00:37:16,853
There she goes.

354
00:37:19,032 --> 00:37:21,330
There. Get after her.

355
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:24,434
We've got to stop her before she stops us.

356
00:37:47,994 --> 00:37:51,725
<i>The weather bureau reports</i>
<i>no sign of an end to the dreariness...</i>

357
00:37:51,798 --> 00:37:54,028
<i>that's bringing the whole world to a stop.</i>

358
00:37:54,101 --> 00:37:56,831
<i>The accident rate is up,</i>
<i>the birth rate is down...</i>

359
00:37:56,903 --> 00:38:00,202
<i>and every country in the world</i>
<i>is blaming the whole situation...</i>

360
00:38:00,273 --> 00:38:01,968
<i>on some other country.</i>

361
00:38:02,042 --> 00:38:05,205
<i>Hospitals report their patients</i>
<i>have stopped asking...</i>

362
00:38:05,278 --> 00:38:06,711
<i>when they'll get better.</i>

363
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:10,113
<i>Things have become so depressing,</i>
<i>in fact....</i>

364
00:38:10,717 --> 00:38:12,776
<i>In fact, why am I even here?</i>

365
00:38:12,853 --> 00:38:16,050
<i>Why should I be the only one</i>
<i>who hasn't given up?</i>

366
00:38:23,063 --> 00:38:25,930
When she gave it to me,
Rainbow said never to use it...

367
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:27,796
except in a real emergency.

368
00:38:28,602 --> 00:38:30,229
But this sure looks like it.

369
00:38:30,303 --> 00:38:34,637
If we don't get the color back in the world
soon, there won't be a world.

370
00:38:34,975 --> 00:38:37,944
She said all I have to do
was put it in any door...

371
00:38:38,311 --> 00:38:40,711
and it'll take me to Rainbow Land.

372
00:38:45,986 --> 00:38:48,011
Even the magic's given up.

373
00:38:52,425 --> 00:38:54,916
Rainbow, help!

374
00:39:29,329 --> 00:39:30,956
Intruders!

375
00:39:32,899 --> 00:39:34,833
I didn't invite anybody.

376
00:39:40,607 --> 00:39:43,940
Children.
Children never bring good presents.

377
00:39:44,878 --> 00:39:46,505
Never.

378
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,104
Get rid of them.

379
00:39:57,023 --> 00:39:59,787
I don't like the look of this place.

380
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,564
Rainbow, we can't.

381
00:40:06,499 --> 00:40:09,093
Go back if you want to.

382
00:40:09,369 --> 00:40:11,735
I can do anything you can.

383
00:40:19,913 --> 00:40:21,005
Girls.

384
00:40:21,348 --> 00:40:23,339
We're almost there.

385
00:40:23,617 --> 00:40:25,107
<i>Danger.</i>

386
00:40:25,685 --> 00:40:27,346
I've got to help her.

387
00:40:46,406 --> 00:40:48,966
This is fun.

388
00:40:50,911 --> 00:40:53,243
We should have guests more often.

389
00:41:35,021 --> 00:41:39,458
What do you seek here?

390
00:41:40,093 --> 00:41:43,790
-We have to talk to the Princess.
-Please?

391
00:41:43,964 --> 00:41:45,329
No.

392
00:41:55,075 --> 00:41:56,201
Come on!

393
00:41:56,276 --> 00:41:57,300
This way!

394
00:41:57,377 --> 00:41:59,675
I want that belt.

395
00:42:00,613 --> 00:42:04,105
You even need somebody to tell you
which way to run.

396
00:42:04,184 --> 00:42:06,914
Some of us aren't used to running away.

397
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:11,821
Hurry.

398
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,694
No.

399
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:32,009
Hang on to me.

400
00:42:43,189 --> 00:42:44,656
It's an elevator.

401
00:42:49,696 --> 00:42:52,893
One of these
has to take us where the Princess is.

402
00:42:53,066 --> 00:42:54,727
Maybe it's a trap.

403
00:43:33,573 --> 00:43:34,870
Come in.

404
00:43:35,608 --> 00:43:39,044
The Princess has been looking forward
to meeting you.

405
00:43:41,481 --> 00:43:43,073
Where's my present?

406
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:50,987
How can you think of presents
at a time like this?

407
00:43:51,057 --> 00:43:55,084
That belt is fabulous. Take it off.

408
00:43:55,361 --> 00:43:57,727
Come on, give it to me.

409
00:43:57,797 --> 00:44:00,129
There are some things you can't have.

410
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,758
Don't yell.

411
00:44:02,635 --> 00:44:06,503
You're frightening him.
There, now, it's all right.

412
00:44:06,806 --> 00:44:08,740
Everything's all right.

413
00:44:10,643 --> 00:44:13,237
You have to leave Spectra alone.

414
00:44:13,613 --> 00:44:16,241
Nobody says no to me.

415
00:44:25,325 --> 00:44:27,589
I want the belt.

416
00:44:32,565 --> 00:44:33,657
Stay.

417
00:44:41,608 --> 00:44:43,940
No, Krys.

418
00:44:51,951 --> 00:44:53,145
Got you.

419
00:44:57,891 --> 00:45:00,587
It'll look marvelous with my red dress.

420
00:45:02,262 --> 00:45:04,958
I don't ever want to see them again.

421
00:45:15,275 --> 00:45:19,302
"And all we have to do is walk in
and explain it all to the Princess."

422
00:45:19,479 --> 00:45:21,538
How dumb can a girl get?

423
00:45:21,714 --> 00:45:24,649
If you hadn't been in such a hurry
to be a hero...

424
00:45:24,717 --> 00:45:26,480
I'd still have my belt.

425
00:45:26,686 --> 00:45:28,551
It doesn't matter much.

426
00:45:28,821 --> 00:45:32,951
By the time we get out of here,
the whole universe will be this dark.

427
00:45:33,026 --> 00:45:36,553
We'll find a way.
We have to keep believing, Krys.

428
00:45:36,729 --> 00:45:40,028
I know everybody in Rainbow Land
will be ready to help.

429
00:45:40,099 --> 00:45:42,465
I know there won't be any trouble there.

430
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:49,208
Come on, Skydancer,
we have to work faster.

431
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:52,378
More. Faster.

432
00:45:56,349 --> 00:45:58,943
They've got the color console working.

433
00:46:03,623 --> 00:46:05,113
Keep trying.

434
00:46:12,165 --> 00:46:16,067
I've got to find a way to get out of here
without the color belt.

435
00:46:16,135 --> 00:46:18,899
We don't need any belt. We need a ladder.

436
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,164
There's a light.

437
00:46:24,744 --> 00:46:27,736
-On-X.
<i>-Greetings, Krys.</i>

438
00:46:29,048 --> 00:46:31,539
You have to get us out of here.

439
00:46:31,918 --> 00:46:33,180
<i>Oh, no.</i>

440
00:46:38,224 --> 00:46:40,124
Somebody will hear him.

441
00:46:41,694 --> 00:46:43,628
He'll never get in.

442
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:46,592
On-X, keep trying.

443
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,392
On-X, go and get Starlite.

444
00:46:51,104 --> 00:46:53,504
<i>Starlite. Mission accepted.</i>

445
00:46:53,573 --> 00:46:56,508
Tell him the Princess has the color belt.

446
00:46:59,512 --> 00:47:01,537
A lot of good that's gonna do.

447
00:47:01,614 --> 00:47:04,549
That dumb horse can't even fly
without your rainbow.

448
00:47:04,617 --> 00:47:07,848
He can think.
Which is more than your horse can do.

449
00:47:12,258 --> 00:47:15,318
I've got to get into that castle somehow
and get that belt.

450
00:47:15,395 --> 00:47:17,693
And you've got to make sure
they don't see me.

451
00:47:17,764 --> 00:47:20,255
You start flying around out there.

452
00:47:20,366 --> 00:47:22,266
<i>Plan accepted.</i>

453
00:47:38,885 --> 00:47:40,648
-Krys, look.
-What?

454
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,347
He's back.

455
00:47:48,194 --> 00:47:50,526
Who's making all that noise?

456
00:47:55,068 --> 00:47:56,330
Fire.

457
00:48:05,978 --> 00:48:07,502
Go away.

458
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,347
Get off the bed.

459
00:48:17,256 --> 00:48:20,885
You better start listening to me, all of you.

460
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:37,002
There must be a stairway
here somewhere.

461
00:48:56,829 --> 00:48:58,091
Up.

462
00:48:59,132 --> 00:49:03,466
Why am I the only one who can
ever do anything around this place?

463
00:49:04,137 --> 00:49:07,265
Meet me at the dungeon.
I'm coming down.

464
00:49:13,913 --> 00:49:15,972
If that tin horse doesn't give himself up...

465
00:49:16,048 --> 00:49:19,449
his little friends
get thrown off my balcony.

466
00:49:23,723 --> 00:49:25,623
Another horse?

467
00:49:28,528 --> 00:49:30,928
No horses in my room.

468
00:49:37,236 --> 00:49:40,262
No horse is getting teeth marks
on my belt.

469
00:49:45,144 --> 00:49:47,078
I want my belt back.

470
00:49:56,489 --> 00:49:58,957
Guards, to the dungeon.

471
00:49:59,692 --> 00:50:02,490
Not you. You get that horse.

472
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:06,255
He's got the color belt.

473
00:50:09,168 --> 00:50:10,635
Try, On-X.

474
00:50:14,507 --> 00:50:17,806
We've got to find a way to get up there
and get it from him.

475
00:50:32,091 --> 00:50:34,082
<i>Danger!</i>

476
00:51:10,663 --> 00:51:13,757
Bring my belt back here this minute!

477
00:51:13,833 --> 00:51:15,858
You'll never get away with this.

478
00:51:18,337 --> 00:51:22,967
You'll never, ever get away with this.

479
00:51:31,684 --> 00:51:35,950
We've got to get that magic jewel.
That's the only way to stop her.

480
00:51:36,088 --> 00:51:37,817
I need more power.

481
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:41,257
We've got to get back to Rainbow Land
and get more star sprinkle.

482
00:51:41,327 --> 00:51:42,919
And we've got to hurry.

483
00:51:42,995 --> 00:51:46,226
I hope that rainbow's still strong enough
to get us there.

484
00:51:56,075 --> 00:52:00,478
Banish them
where they'll never bother me again.

485
00:52:06,819 --> 00:52:08,081
<i>Danger.</i>

486
00:52:09,422 --> 00:52:11,413
Rainbow! Watch out!

487
00:52:13,192 --> 00:52:17,424
Faster, Starlite!
We've got to get away from it.

488
00:52:33,279 --> 00:52:37,511
Krys, get to Rainbow Land! Get help!

489
00:52:44,857 --> 00:52:46,916
On-X, try.

490
00:53:02,274 --> 00:53:04,242
Starlite, jump!

491
00:53:09,148 --> 00:53:10,615
Oh, no!

492
00:53:33,572 --> 00:53:35,540
Boy, what a ride.

493
00:53:36,042 --> 00:53:40,206
-Where are we?
-Wherever we are, I'm not staying.

494
00:53:43,249 --> 00:53:45,877
Oh, no. Its power's used up.

495
00:53:55,961 --> 00:53:58,327
I haven't lost all my power.

496
00:53:58,397 --> 00:54:01,662
-Throw down that belt.
-No.

497
00:54:03,102 --> 00:54:07,368
-You'll stay up there till you do.
-You can't keep us up here.

498
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,204
Prisoners don't talk back.

499
00:54:10,876 --> 00:54:14,039
Sgt. Zombo reporting to the Princess.

500
00:54:14,113 --> 00:54:16,980
If she ever wants to come down
from there, Your Highness...

501
00:54:17,049 --> 00:54:19,449
she'll give me the belt.

502
00:54:32,765 --> 00:54:36,826
His name's not Starlite.
His name's Crusader.

503
00:54:36,936 --> 00:54:38,995
He's my horse now.

504
00:54:49,014 --> 00:54:50,777
I'll get your horse back.

505
00:54:51,283 --> 00:54:53,183
We'll get him back.

506
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:55,682
Come on, On-X.

507
00:54:59,024 --> 00:55:00,184
<i>Obstacle.</i>

508
00:55:09,468 --> 00:55:11,834
<i>Obstacle removed.</i>

509
00:55:21,647 --> 00:55:23,137
New ones.

510
00:55:24,116 --> 00:55:27,313
I remember when we tried to get away.

511
00:55:28,387 --> 00:55:31,379
I can't remember that far back.

512
00:55:33,492 --> 00:55:38,452
Help me, hopscotch-brain! Get me down.

513
00:55:38,531 --> 00:55:41,159
We've got to find out
where they put our spaceship.

514
00:55:41,233 --> 00:55:43,758
I'll get you down, Murky.

515
00:55:44,203 --> 00:55:46,603
I'm hurrying, Murky.

516
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:53,670
No. Put me down.

517
00:55:53,746 --> 00:55:57,182
I don't see
the spaceship anywhere, Murky.

518
00:55:57,249 --> 00:55:59,274
Put me down.

519
00:56:02,621 --> 00:56:05,181
Lurky, there's someone coming.

520
00:56:05,257 --> 00:56:06,485
No.

521
00:56:29,481 --> 00:56:30,971
Where did he go?

522
00:56:40,259 --> 00:56:42,159
Yes, Your Highness?

523
00:56:43,195 --> 00:56:47,564
Yes, Your Highness.
The new prisoners have escaped.

524
00:56:52,338 --> 00:56:54,203
Who said that?

525
00:57:02,715 --> 00:57:06,879
-We'll never get in there.
-lf you're too scared, stay here.

526
00:57:08,153 --> 00:57:10,246
I'm not scared of anything.

527
00:57:25,471 --> 00:57:27,371
<i>Danger.</i>

528
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:30,934
<i>Passenger too heavy.</i>

529
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:33,035
Get off my horse.

530
00:57:37,216 --> 00:57:39,013
I'm coming, On-X!

531
00:57:44,623 --> 00:57:46,523
<i>Over....</i>

532
00:58:09,214 --> 00:58:11,273
<i>Overload.</i>

533
00:58:12,384 --> 00:58:13,578
Oh, no!

534
00:59:41,774 --> 00:59:43,173
There.

535
00:59:46,278 --> 00:59:47,870
Star sprinkles.

536
01:00:13,939 --> 01:00:15,406
This way.

537
01:00:23,949 --> 01:00:25,143
No.

538
01:00:39,565 --> 01:00:40,657
Watch out.

539
01:00:49,374 --> 01:00:51,467
Can your rainbow get us up there?

540
01:00:52,644 --> 01:00:54,805
The rainbow can take us anywhere.

541
01:01:01,987 --> 01:01:04,683
Where did you get those star sprinkles?

542
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:07,256
Magic and I are old friends.

543
01:01:07,326 --> 01:01:09,089
How did you know my name?

544
01:01:11,363 --> 01:01:14,093
I sent my horse to fetch you.

545
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,591
-You're....
-Orin.

546
01:01:16,668 --> 01:01:18,932
I heard the Princess sent you here.

547
01:01:19,004 --> 01:01:23,202
I've been searching all over for....
But there's no time for chitchat now.

548
01:01:23,275 --> 01:01:25,800
Spectra grows darker by the moment.

549
01:01:26,512 --> 01:01:29,208
There is one thing we have to do first.

550
01:01:30,015 --> 01:01:34,782
What could possibly be more important
than saving the universe?

551
01:01:49,168 --> 01:01:53,468
-Your power is his only chance.
-And Starlite's.

552
01:01:53,705 --> 01:01:57,835
I think the time has come
for Krys to have this.

553
01:01:58,076 --> 01:02:00,909
I knew you the two of you
would meet one day.

554
01:02:00,979 --> 01:02:05,473
Its magic has endured
since the most ancient times.

555
01:02:06,385 --> 01:02:09,445
He'll need the power of your rainbow
to make it work.

556
01:02:09,521 --> 01:02:13,958
But with your help, he'll be the warrior
he's always dreamed of being.

557
01:02:14,026 --> 01:02:16,119
If we can get it to him.

558
01:02:16,628 --> 01:02:18,391
I'll get it to him.

559
01:02:35,314 --> 01:02:37,680
Wipe that smile off your....

560
01:02:40,118 --> 01:02:43,645
-Murky, look.
-Stop her.

561
01:02:46,592 --> 01:02:47,854
Rainbow!

562
01:02:54,299 --> 01:02:56,028
Stand still.

563
01:02:59,204 --> 01:03:00,831
Get out of the way.

564
01:03:02,941 --> 01:03:04,670
Get away from there.

565
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:10,605
Put this on your wrist.

566
01:03:14,886 --> 01:03:16,444
Out of the way.

567
01:03:16,555 --> 01:03:18,113
Attention!

568
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:19,248
You.

569
01:03:24,796 --> 01:03:28,288
-What does it do?
-I forgot to ask.

570
01:03:38,944 --> 01:03:40,639
Thanks, Rainbow.

571
01:03:52,157 --> 01:03:56,059
How can they build a fort
with only one gate?

572
01:04:02,534 --> 01:04:04,695
Now we'll stop the Princess.

573
01:04:05,904 --> 01:04:07,303
Let's go.

574
01:04:12,144 --> 01:04:15,079
We caught them trying to escape,
Your Highness.

575
01:04:17,683 --> 01:04:21,278
They are not the ones I want.
I want Rainbow Brite.

576
01:04:21,353 --> 01:04:22,718
And her belt.

577
01:04:22,788 --> 01:04:24,881
Not on my throne.

578
01:04:26,258 --> 01:04:28,590
I know they don't have a present for me.

579
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:31,823
We do have a present for you,
Your Highness.

580
01:04:33,265 --> 01:04:36,166
You didn't have to.

581
01:04:36,435 --> 01:04:39,666
We're going to give you Rainbow Brite.

582
01:04:39,738 --> 01:04:44,402
You're going to do
what all my forces couldn't do?

583
01:04:45,143 --> 01:04:49,170
Your Highness,
we've been fighting that Rainbow brat...

584
01:04:49,247 --> 01:04:52,182
for years and years and years.

585
01:04:52,851 --> 01:04:55,081
We know her weak spots.

586
01:04:55,153 --> 01:04:57,587
Then why haven't you stopped her?

587
01:05:00,125 --> 01:05:02,389
-Answer the question.
-Why?

588
01:05:02,461 --> 01:05:05,589
Because, Your Highness....

589
01:05:07,432 --> 01:05:10,765
Because we were waiting
until she led us...

590
01:05:10,836 --> 01:05:13,270
to where she keeps all her belts.

591
01:05:13,338 --> 01:05:15,772
She has more belts?

592
01:05:16,842 --> 01:05:19,333
Dozens of them, Your Highness.

593
01:05:19,578 --> 01:05:22,342
Go after her. Bring her back here.

594
01:05:22,414 --> 01:05:26,407
Meanwhile, your spaceship
will be bringing you Spectra.

595
01:05:26,651 --> 01:05:29,518
I'll have everything.

596
01:05:29,588 --> 01:05:32,421
I deserve everything.

597
01:05:40,499 --> 01:05:43,935
Murky, how are we gonna
catch Rainbow Brite?

598
01:05:44,336 --> 01:05:47,897
We're not going to catch her,
kangaroo-brain.

599
01:05:47,973 --> 01:05:50,533
We're going after that diamond.

600
01:05:57,416 --> 01:06:00,078
It's not Murky and Lurky
I'm worried about.

601
01:06:00,152 --> 01:06:02,450
It's the Princess' spaceship.

602
01:06:02,654 --> 01:06:05,987
The only way to stop that ship
from reaching Spectra...

603
01:06:06,057 --> 01:06:08,855
is to destroy the source of its power.

604
01:06:08,927 --> 01:06:10,360
The magic jewel?

605
01:06:10,695 --> 01:06:15,530
The source of all her power.
And she will use it all to stop you.

606
01:06:15,967 --> 01:06:20,870
The castle's defenses are strong,
but there is a way in.

607
01:06:20,939 --> 01:06:25,035
A way so perilous that it is left unguarded.

608
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:28,477
A wheel turns at the foot of the tower.

609
01:06:28,547 --> 01:06:30,515
If you're not afraid....

610
01:06:30,582 --> 01:06:33,551
-I'm not.
-I'm not afraid of anything.

611
01:06:33,618 --> 01:06:35,609
You have the prism now.

612
01:06:36,154 --> 01:06:38,122
-But how does it--
-Work?

613
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:42,456
Just as you saw.
All you have to do is need it.

614
01:06:42,894 --> 01:06:47,695
It will do its job
as long as your purpose is true...

615
01:06:47,933 --> 01:06:50,060
and the rainbow is near.

616
01:06:50,135 --> 01:06:51,932
And I must do my job.

617
01:06:52,003 --> 01:06:56,667
Spectra must be kept alive
until you've destroyed the stone.

618
01:06:57,142 --> 01:07:00,077
I'm afraid I'll have to borrow my horse.

619
01:07:00,579 --> 01:07:04,515
Old On-X, trusty steed of noble voice.

620
01:07:05,183 --> 01:07:07,651
You can ride with me on Starlite.

621
01:07:14,226 --> 01:07:15,284
<i>Orin.</i>

622
01:07:17,229 --> 01:07:21,563
And remember,
the whole universe depends on you.

623
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:26,996
Be brave, be bold,
and don't fight with each other.

624
01:07:46,458 --> 01:07:49,791
I don't like the idea
of you going up there without me.

625
01:07:50,195 --> 01:07:54,131
I'll send the rainbow down for you
as soon as it's safe to use it.

626
01:08:03,642 --> 01:08:05,234
No.

627
01:08:09,648 --> 01:08:11,206
Krys, jump.

628
01:08:18,690 --> 01:08:21,659
Come on. Get it loaded.

629
01:08:21,726 --> 01:08:25,218
They're not taking away
any diamonds, are they?

630
01:08:25,297 --> 01:08:28,027
No. Just worthless minerals,
Your Highness.

631
01:08:28,099 --> 01:08:31,830
The engines melt them
and turn them into fuel.

632
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:33,537
Those spider legs...

633
01:08:33,605 --> 01:08:36,802
will take hold of the net
we've woven around Spectra.

634
01:08:36,875 --> 01:08:41,642
The greatest diamond in the universe
is almost yours.

635
01:08:42,414 --> 01:08:43,506
Mine.

636
01:08:44,316 --> 01:08:47,080
I've always loved the sound of that word.

637
01:08:59,698 --> 01:09:02,667
-You broke it.
-I didn't break it.

638
01:09:11,443 --> 01:09:14,879
-Do you mind?
-I didn't mean it.

639
01:09:17,582 --> 01:09:19,482
-Can you swim?
-Sure.

640
01:09:19,551 --> 01:09:20,916
Good.

641
01:09:32,364 --> 01:09:34,457
Why, at a moment like this...

642
01:09:34,532 --> 01:09:37,729
is the most magnificent horse
in the universe...

643
01:09:37,802 --> 01:09:40,327
standing here doing nothing at all?

644
01:09:48,647 --> 01:09:50,842
I want that ship on its way in one hour.

645
01:09:50,915 --> 01:09:52,849
Less than an hour, Your Highness.

646
01:09:52,917 --> 01:09:55,249
I do want that diamond.

647
01:10:07,432 --> 01:10:08,990
Oh, no!

648
01:10:54,079 --> 01:10:57,412
I don't know why
they don't think keep horses in mind...

649
01:10:57,482 --> 01:11:00,349
when they design a castle. Here goes.

650
01:11:20,905 --> 01:11:22,805
-Spectra.
-Orin.

651
01:11:23,041 --> 01:11:26,374
Come on. He's doing his job. Let's do ours.

652
01:11:26,678 --> 01:11:28,669
Let's get that jewel.

653
01:11:39,390 --> 01:11:43,724
They never even noticed me.
Nobody ever notices me.

654
01:11:44,095 --> 01:11:45,995
Just hurry, my friend.

655
01:11:47,165 --> 01:11:49,895
Talk a little less, work a little more.

656
01:11:51,169 --> 01:11:56,163
I don't know how just the two of us
are going to save the whole universe.

657
01:11:57,308 --> 01:12:01,904
There are three more,
but they should've been back by now.

658
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:04,915
I can't even see the Earth anymore.

659
01:12:18,129 --> 01:12:21,326
She'll come through. I know she will.

660
01:12:22,333 --> 01:12:23,960
You have to, Rainbow.

661
01:12:58,069 --> 01:12:59,400
Come on.

662
01:13:02,106 --> 01:13:05,507
Lurky, get back there and fix that engine.

663
01:13:05,577 --> 01:13:08,876
Murky, look. Rainbow Land.

664
01:13:09,547 --> 01:13:13,608
Goody, I get to sleep
in my own bed tonight.

665
01:13:13,785 --> 01:13:17,050
That's not Rainbow Land, alfalfa-breath.

666
01:13:17,355 --> 01:13:18,686
That's....

667
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:23,857
It's....

668
01:13:32,403 --> 01:13:35,839
My belt. You've brought it back.

669
01:13:35,907 --> 01:13:38,808
-To stop you.
-You're too late.

670
01:13:39,344 --> 01:13:44,145
My spaceship is all ready to take off
to bring my diamond home.

671
01:13:54,325 --> 01:13:56,190
We can do it, Krys.

672
01:14:06,104 --> 01:14:07,537
I need your power.

673
01:14:15,179 --> 01:14:16,942
Now I've got you.

674
01:14:19,317 --> 01:14:21,547
You stay right where you are.

675
01:14:43,942 --> 01:14:47,571
Nobody touches that throne but me.

676
01:14:48,846 --> 01:14:51,576
See, Murky? It is Rainbow Land.

677
01:14:52,016 --> 01:14:53,449
Now, Krys.

678
01:14:54,819 --> 01:14:55,979
No!

679
01:14:58,323 --> 01:14:59,551
Stop!

680
01:15:06,998 --> 01:15:08,693
No!

681
01:15:15,239 --> 01:15:19,039
It's all right. I won't let them hurt you.

682
01:15:27,418 --> 01:15:30,387
-We did it.
-We won.

683
01:15:31,155 --> 01:15:32,850
Not so fast.

684
01:15:34,926 --> 01:15:39,124
Now I've got you
right where I want you, Rainbow Brite.

685
01:15:46,204 --> 01:15:49,696
See, Murky?
I told you it was Rainbow Land.

686
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:10,522
Look.

687
01:16:14,599 --> 01:16:17,159
You thought you stopped me?
You little brats.

688
01:16:20,838 --> 01:16:23,773
No. She's heading for Spectra.

689
01:16:24,042 --> 01:16:25,873
We've got to stop her.

690
01:16:32,350 --> 01:16:35,581
Hi, I'm Bombo. Polisher first-class.

691
01:16:36,287 --> 01:16:38,050
What's all this?

692
01:16:38,389 --> 01:16:40,721
He's not hypnotized anymore.

693
01:16:44,796 --> 01:16:46,195
They all stopped.

694
01:16:53,137 --> 01:16:55,196
-You did it.
-What's that?

695
01:17:00,211 --> 01:17:03,806
You can't stop me now. You can't!

696
01:17:06,984 --> 01:17:08,713
Not now.

697
01:17:09,253 --> 01:17:11,414
We can't be out of fuel now.

698
01:17:13,224 --> 01:17:16,682
There must be something.

699
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,135
It's going to crash.

700
01:17:31,209 --> 01:17:36,078
And this whole planet
will shatter into a billion pieces.

701
01:17:40,351 --> 01:17:43,684
If I can't have that diamond,
no one's going to have it.

702
01:17:46,757 --> 01:17:50,386
I always get my way in the end.

703
01:17:56,734 --> 01:18:00,363
No, not the rainbow.

704
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:34,235
She did it!

705
01:18:50,821 --> 01:18:52,413
Thanks, Rainbow.

706
01:19:05,236 --> 01:19:07,602
See? Everything's fine.

707
01:19:14,011 --> 01:19:16,445
Welcome to Rainbow Land, Krys.

708
01:19:24,956 --> 01:19:26,583
Winter's a whole lot easier...

709
01:19:26,657 --> 01:19:29,592
but I think next winter,
I'm taking a vacation.

710
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:32,026
We'll all help fix things up.

711
01:19:39,737 --> 01:19:43,673
We have time now. The universe is safe.

712
01:19:43,808 --> 01:19:48,370
The universe is alive again.
There's color, joy, and hope again.

713
01:19:48,446 --> 01:19:50,744
And we'll keep it that way.

714
01:19:52,783 --> 01:19:55,081
You'll need help, you know.

715
01:19:57,688 --> 01:20:00,657
-You mean it?
-He's your horse now.

716
01:20:05,463 --> 01:20:07,192
We'll all work together.

717
01:20:07,265 --> 01:20:11,565
And keep the universe
bright and beautiful forever.

718
01:20:30,588 --> 01:20:33,557
Maybe Rainbow Land is that way, Murky.

719
01:20:33,624 --> 01:20:36,752
Or this way. Or maybe it's that.
