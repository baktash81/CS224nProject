1
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:49,230
We were once a peaceful race of intelligent mechanical beings.

2
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,570
But then came the war.

3
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,250
Between the autobots who fought for freedom,

4
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,540
and the decepticons in draft of tyranny.

5
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,400
Over matched, and out numbered.

6
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,150
Our defeat was all but certain.

7
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,290
But in the wars final days,

8
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,160
one autobot ship escaped the battle.

9
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,770
It was carrying a secret cargo,

10
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,920
which would have changed our planets fate.

11
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,560
A desperate mission.

12
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,170
Our final hope.

13
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,540
A hope, that vanished.

14
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,640
Move it over there.

15
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,980
Move it over there, one more down there.

16
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,400
Whatcha got?

17
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,260
Impact detected.

18
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,160
We have impact confirmed.

19
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,310
Contacted.

20
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,440
- 22:50 GMT. - What?

21
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,270
Give me SEC-DEV on the phone right away.

22
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,310
Mr. McNamara, the President is expecting you.

23
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,560
- Get Bobby in here. - Mr. President.

24
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,380
Definition, top secret.

25
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,630
We believe a UFO has crashed into the moon.

26
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,610
We think the Russians are on to it as well.

27
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,340
Well then you tell NASA to move heaven and earth.

28
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,830
We need to get to the moon.

29
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,800
We're going to attempt a manned mission.

30
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,630
NASA said it would take five years.

31
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,430
You get there before the Russians.

32
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,650
I believe that this nation should commit itself,

33
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,420
to achieving the goal.

34
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,980
- Fifteen seconds. - Before this decade is out,

35
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,060
of landing a man on the moon,

36
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,150
and returning him safely to the earth.

37
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,200
Ignition sequence starts

38
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,570
Five, four, three,

39
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,670
two, one.

40
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,300
And ignition.

41
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,990
Lift off, we have a lift off.

42
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,120
Thirty two minutes past the hour.

43
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,810
Lift off on Apollo 11, tower three.

44
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,660
Apollo 11 is on the way.

45
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:06,170
Riding that pillar of flame from the Saturn five.

46
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,110
Out there 250,000 miles away,

47
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:13,650
where the moon is waiting for man's first arrival.

48
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,500
Houston you're a go for landing, over.

49
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,320
40 feet, down 2 1/2. Kicking up some dust.

50
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,050
Thirty feet, two and a half down. Faint shadow

51
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,390
Four Forward. Drifting to the right a little.

52
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,700
20 feet, down a half.

53
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,830
Contact light.

54
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,360
Okay, engine stop.

55
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:46,460
Houston, tranquility base here, The Eagle has landed.

56
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,390
You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue.

57
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,430
We're breathing again.

58
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,720
Perhaps 400 million persons are watching this broadcast today,

59
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,670
of the greatest event in our time.

60
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:05,220
And one of the great events of all recorded history.

61
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,100
I'm at the foot of the ladder.

62
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,190
I'm going to step on to land now.

63
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,070
That's one small step for man,

64
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,120
one giant leap for mankind.

65
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,430
- Are we good? - Yes sir.

66
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,700
An official time on the first step 1092....

67
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,250
Eagle we're getting a signal interference.

68
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,230
Do you copy?

69
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,880
We now have a confirmation. Loss of signal from Apollo 11.

70
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,640
The Apollo 11 is for the moment, on the far side of the moon.

71
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,680
Neil, you are dark on the rock.

72
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,960
Mission is a go.

73
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,850
You have 21 minutes.

74
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,560
Please stand by, 3 minutes and 45 seconds and counting.

75
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,830
My god.

76
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,010
It's some sort of giant metal face.

77
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,940
Jesus.

78
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,320
Control, we are inside the ship.

79
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,550
Extensive damage.

80
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,830
Way to big to check the entire ship.

81
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,560
Everything is dead in here, Houston.

82
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,160
No signs of life anywhere.

83
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,760
This thing is massive.

84
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,350
We copy.

85
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,880
You got seven minutes on your oxygen.

86
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,130
We are not alone after all, are we.

87
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,570
No, sir.

88
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,120
We're not alone.

89
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,300
All right, go ahead Mr. President.

90
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,920
Hello, Neil, Buzz.

91
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,800
I'm talking to you by telephone

92
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,140
from the oval room at the White House.

93
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:41,900
And this certainly has to

94
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,700
be the most historic telephone call ever made.

95
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,850
I just can't tell you how proud we all are.

96
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:55,090
For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives.

97
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,780
Because of what you have done.

98
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,570
We have splashed down.

99
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,900
The heavens has become a part of man's world.

100
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,110
For one priceless moment.

101
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,410
In all of history of man.

102
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,290
All the people on this earth are truly one.

103
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,520
Along with their pride in which you have done.

104
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,690
You've inspired us to redouble our efforts,

105
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,370
to bring peace and tranquility to Earth.

106
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,950
My hero, needs to wake up.

107
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,540
What is that?

108
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,210
This is your new lucky bunny.

109
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,500
Yeah, it's a beautiful thought, Carly.

110
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,070
But I don't think it's the whole, uh, bunny that's lucky.

111
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,810
You see it's just this section here.

112
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,270
You see it's just the rabbit's foot that's lucky.

113
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,170
All right, it's just a good luck charm.

114
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,230
Hmm, help you think positive.

115
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,170
Today's important.

116
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,350
Come on, get up.

117
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,920
- Hey, wear that nice tie. - Yeah.

118
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,970
You need any money for lunch?

119
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,630
No, I don't need any money for lunch.

120
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,440
I have money from yesterday's lunch.

121
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,280
You love it, don't you.

122
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,080
I'm just your American boy-toy.

123
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,170
I love boy-toy.

124
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,580
You know how demoralizing it is to save the world twice,

125
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,970
to be groveling for a job.

126
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,190
They don't know you saved the world, Sam.

127
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,320
I mean I do, I believe you.

128
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,060
Government knows, but he doesn't give me a job right here in D.C.

129
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,650
I mean I should be working with the autobots.

130
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,910
Otherwise, it's not fair.

131
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,220
Come on, they paid for your college.

132
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,250
The president gave you a hero medal.

133
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,680
Thank you, man. Great job.

134
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,480
And as I recall

135
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,460
that wasn't even the highlight of your day.

136
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,170
Mr. Ambassador, here.

137
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,250
British Embassy you're up next.

138
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,030
- It's not really... - No, you don't wear it.

139
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,190
- I couldn't even if I wanted to. - Leave it there.

140
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,560
Leave it in the box, right.

141
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,340
You keep it in there, what a gorgeous box.

142
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,100
Oh yeah, my medal.

143
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,990
You know who gave that to me?

144
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,140
Who?

145
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,050


146
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,050
- POTUS. - Oh.

147
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,730
The President of the United States.

148
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,330
Hey, it's hard for everybody to get a job.

149
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:17,970
I don't have time.

150
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,600
You see, my parents are going to be here in a week.

151
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,570
From their road-trip party world tour.

152
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,080
My dad gets here, and I don't have a job.

153
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,520
He's gonna spank me you know. It's go time for me.

154
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,890
All right, tonight I'll give you a job.

155
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,430
Romance me with a nice dinner and, uh...

156
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,330
maybe you'll get that bonus.

157
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,870
- Good looking. - Get out of here.

158
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,440
Wait, no, no, no, no, no.

159
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,090
Oh, he's gross.

160
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,000
She's good.

161
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,100
They've been stranded here,

162
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,060
somebody's got to watch out for them, you know.

163
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,400
Yesterday that one was in my underwear drawer.

164
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,240
Good reason, it looked real good too.

165
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,280
- What are you hitting, huh? - I want a normal boyfriend.

166
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,880
That's what you love about me, isn't it?

167
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,070
Heh, what a cry baby.

168
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,500
You know I don't have the word yet.

169
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,720
Maybe a little bit closer when you can pay your half of the rent.

170
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,350
Bye.

171
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,520
Frinking shorting my circuits out here.

172
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,530
It's inhumane, what it is.

173
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,650
Make us live in a box on a balcony.

174
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:13,230
Right next to a beast.

175
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,280
- Like a common animal. - Stop, okay.

176
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,340
You and your creepy psychic,

177
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,670
you can't be in here without permission.

178
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,900
According to who, Miss blondy-blonde?

179
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,410
Get out little doggie.

180
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,550
Yo brain's what's up?

181
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,130
Doing good.

182
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,810
Ah shoot, I'd seen this one.

183
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,630
It's the one where Spock goes nuts.

184
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,700
You know Sam, I don't know about moving in with this chick.

185
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,130
Uh, what if she dumps us like the last girl?

186
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,960
What she was mean, didn't like her.

187
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,950
Us guys got to stick together.

188
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,210
No, we're not family. You're a political refugee.

189
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:49,770
And I have finally found someone who appreciates me for me.

190
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,720
Well you tell her that we're not your pets.

191
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,870
And we're not your toys.

192
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,300
All right, we're an advanced genius alien race,

193
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,500
just looking for a home.

194
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,320
- We could leave it right here. - Didn't think we should stop.

195
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,020
Come on, what are they going to do, tow it?

196
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,130
Where is he?

197
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,320
Sammy!

198
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,790
- Oh, come on that's funny, ha, ha. - Sam.

199
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,670
I miss you guys so much.

200
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,310
Sure you did, what do you think?

201
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,150
- Look at that. - Cute.

202
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,540
-Gold. - Stop it.

203
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,460
Wait until you see the end.

204
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,980
Oh I love your little tie.

205
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,600
Hey, where's my girl?

206
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,480
- where's my beautiful Carly? - She's at work, Ma.

207
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,700
- She's got a new job. - Right.

208
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,800
I thought you were going to be here in a week.

209
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,190
The 21st of the 11th, Dad remember?

210
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,820
- It's all the enthusiastic thing... - ... A love job with flies.

211
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,660
Oh, are we keeping you from something?

212
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,900
Like say, your job.

213
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,240
Well it's about time.

214
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,320
You had us worried.

215
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,080
Uh, I have, uh, job interviews.

216
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,280
Oh, that's good.

217
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,220
- That sucks. - Stop it.

218
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,420
You don't have to be so negative dad, you know.

219
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,280
You're in DC, you're here with your son, your family.

220
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,330
I mean it's good times.

221
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,360
It sucks that you don't have a job.

222
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,030
- Good things to do here too, right? - Yeah.

223
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,900
Right, museums and monuments, okay.

224
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,030
- I'll see you tonight. - I'm bagging the gift.

225
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,580
Sam, I think for an interview you should wear real pants.

226
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,460
I think for life you should wear real pants.

227
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,470
Oh, wha...what happened to Bumble Bee?

228
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,670
He's off on his missions, I had to get this as a back-up.

229
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,600
Oh, your car has a job, huh?

230
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,000
What does it change into?

231
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,480
It doesn't change into anything.

232
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,250
It's a collectors' item, I got it for a steal.

233
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,510
It just needs some work, trust me.

234
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:18,560
Oh, I think it's darling. It reminds me a lot of Bumble Bee.

235
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,310
If Bumble Bee were a sad piece of shit.

236
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,780
Come on we'll give you a ride.

237
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,390
In the years since our arrival.

238
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:33,230
Our new home, Earth had seen much change.

239
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,760
Energon detectors guard its cities now.

240
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:40,610
Long range defense systems watch the skies.

241
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,620


242
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,480
So now we assist our allies,

243
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,810
in solving human conflicts.

244
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:51,480
To prevent mankind from bringing harm to itself.

245
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,630
The Defense Minister's car.

246
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,960
On the ground. Better not move, and stay there.

247
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,900
We work in secret teams on various missions around the globe.

248
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,740
And all the while, we search for signs,

249
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,360
of our true enemies return.

250
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,620
I am Voshkod,

251
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,470
General Council with Ukrainian Department of Energy.

252
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,860
My government will officially deny

253
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,500
that we're having this conversation.

254
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,370
At one of our decontamination facilities a discovery was made,

255
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:57,200
which I fear may be alien in nature.

256
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,860
The Facility's name is, Chernobyl.

257
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,160
Mr. Voshkod.

258
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,590
Uninhabited since '86.

259
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:29,280
I hear it won't be livable again for another 20,000 years.

260
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:33,700
At least. Ukraine was the most fertile land, it's a tragedy.

261
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,080
This way.

262
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,830
Gear up, we have 60 minutes on the ground.

263
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,370
Watch your radiation levels.

264
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,850
Mr. Voshkod, where's your protective gear?

265
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,600
Where's your protective gear?

266
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,760
It would not matter.

267
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,480
For me it's only a matter of time.

268
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,630
Through the school.

269
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,250
Uri will take you below.

270
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,780
And one other thing, Colonel, in private.

271
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,860
There are some energy strength...

272
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,560
It can wait.

273
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,120
Keep moving, stay tight.

274
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,020
Okay, right here. Bring up the light.

275
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,930
Officer, we got a visual.

276
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,820
We've found an object. Strapped in some kind of metal harness.

277
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:43,850
What's this?

278
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,400
Guys,

279
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:48,390
Why does this thing have Soviet space program markings on it?

280
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,830
- Sputnik. - Energon readings, sir.

281
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,330
It's strong.

282
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,270
Below us.

283
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,900
It's coming fast.

284
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,530
Go there, go there.

285
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,130
Get to top, right now.

286
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,750
Let's go, let's go!

287
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,370
Let's go its an autobot.

288
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,160
Stay behind me.

289
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,320
Move, move!

290
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,650
Optimus!

291
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,550
Fall back!

292
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:08,180
Bring it flank, bring it flank come on.

293
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,590
Get the heavy weapons.

294
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,360
Optimus.

295
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,100
What the hell was that thing?

296
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,380
That is Shockwave.

297
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,610
Why was he after this?

298
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,750
It's impossible.

299
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,010
This is an engine part.

300
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,290
From a long lost autobot ship.

301
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,690
Pleasure working with you.

302
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,810
Interviews. This is so exciting.

303
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,580
Honey, do you want some gum?

304
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,980
Your breath gets really gnarly when you're nervous.

305
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,300
Mr. Whit-wickey.

306
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,570
Yep, the search is over.

307
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,850
I'm Mr. Whitley.

308
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,850
- Is any one else joining? - No.

309
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,160
No?

310
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,250
- Want me to move right there, I'm moving right there. - I prefer not.

311
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,250
Sensei.

312
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,320
Ready, begin.

313
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,240
Uh, graduated this year

314
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,680
majored in geo politics, minor text things.

315
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,360
Very interested in government technologies,

316
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,860
as they intersect and co-exist.

317
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,970
Shape, future.

318
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,420
Why did we bother sending him to an Ivy College for?

319
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,380
Three months out of school and he can't find a job.

320
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,570
- Mr. Matsu-piece-u. - Matsu Moto

321
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,850
- Masi Moto - Masu Moto.

322
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,760
- Martha, can I call you Martha? - No, you may not.

323
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,660
Okay. Jack, there's two type of people in this world.

324
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,020
There's thinkers and there's doers.

325
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,440
There's winners, there's dreamers and there's buddies.

326
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,510
What about, some witnesses.

327
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,640
You have a very trustworthy face.

328
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,470
You remind of like a... an Asian Colonel Sanders.

329
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,740
A man I can trust.

330
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,390
It's a millennial, you know like some kind of lost generation.

331
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,470
Why was the FBI looking for you?

332
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,260
The what?

333
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,930
Yeah, FBI getting a flag there.

334
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,700
Did you ever have any alien craziness when you were fourteen.

335
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,080
They were very kind to me, found me in a jiffy.

336
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,640
Uh, and that's all been expunged.

337
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,230
Obama get me a medal, actually.

338
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,100
Just saying.

339
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,990
It's always good to have a medal guy in the office, with a medal.

340
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,610
- From Obama? - Yeah.

341
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,420
In this office, we're mostly Republicans.

342
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:49,830
So.

343
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,780
- I'm not feeling to good. - No.

344
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,310
- No. - Why don't you get a little dipping tray.

345
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,300
And dip the dog in the pepto, that's the solution.

346
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,650
Pow, I got another one, we gotta go, come on.

347
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,580
Really?

348
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:00,880
Sit.

349
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,480
Got a nice sell from this.

350
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,380
Sam Witwicky, recent college graduate.

351
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,800
Previous experience next to zero.

352
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,970
Yet, he has a recommend letter from our board.

353
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,370
W.T.F. to that.

354
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,120
Do I know somebody on your board?

355
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,560
Here's the deal, we know who we are.

356
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,210
Accuretta systems is called the leader in telecom, aerospace.

357
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,300
17 billion on profit last year.

358
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,120
We contract for DOP, NASA,

359
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,630
JPL you name it.

360
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,940
You can find here doors open for you.

361
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,040
And what, first job out of college is critical, kid.

362
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,050
You either take a step down the correct career path.

363
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:38,840
Or you fall into a life sucking abyss.

364
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,490
So it all depends on how you respond to my next two words.

365
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,200
Impress me.

366
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,070
Now?

367
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,130
Impress me.

368
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,360
You catch me off guard, I...

369
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,460
Impress me.

370
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,200
I'm an open book, ask me any question you like.

371
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,100
- So you're a go get a ramrod. - Yes sir.

372
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,380
Take charge kind of guy.

373
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,570
I'm a killer, a stone cold killer.

374
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,380
So, take charge guy.

375
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,940
Take charge, Viking, barbarian.

376
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,950
Of course, it's me.

377
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,450
Pow! I'm here.

378
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,760
We are not looking for that here.

379
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,160
No brown nosing, no suck up.

380
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,100
No toolery, I...

381
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,890
Yes, Mr. Brazos.

382
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:25,130
Um, why is Chantal using what appears to be,

383
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,590
a red cup from the red floor?

384
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:30,220
- When we are on the yellow floor. - I'm on it.

385
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:35,090
It is a visual and therefore a visceral betrayal.

386
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,780
Stop it.

387
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,960
Such a dumb ass.

388
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,900
Disgusting.

389
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,680
Thank you.

390
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,500
It's a total anarchy around here.

391
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:51,730
The uh, email I read said administrative aid.

392
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,200
Nope, mail room.

393
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,050
I'm going to go.

394
00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:00,280
Uh, do you have any idea how many Ivy league,

395
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,670
Phi Beta Kappa's would kill...

396
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,570
Mister I saved your life twice.

397
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,800
Okay, I can't tell you how or when.

398
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,340
Or why, but I have done shit that matters.

399
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,410
And I'd just kinda like a job where I matter again.

400
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,640
So thank you, but no thank you.

401
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,200
- Okay. -You know what I think?

402
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,410
You want the job after this job.

403
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:20,550
But son, this is the job that's standing in your way.

404
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:23,820
And that's why you're going to be so very, very good at it.

405
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,230
'Cause when I look at you.

406
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,730
I see a younger me.

407
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,900


408
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,820
All running Autobots in car,

409
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,320
training in 15 minutes.

410
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,050
Dino report to bay 23.

411
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,550
Sideswipe bay 37 for weapons assessment.

412
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,630
Senator, I suggest you remember that when the NASA

413
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,180
...wants funding they call me.

414
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,630
When the CIA is going to take out a target.

415
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,690
They ask first for my permission.

416
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:11,900
When the President wants to know

417
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,200
which members of Congress are politically vulnerable.

418
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,890
In terms of oh, let's say undiscovered criminal conduct.

419
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,480
I'm on their memory dials.

420
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,000
USA agency say they have been monitoring the blast.

421
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,520


422
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:25,080
But in fact this was a covert military strike.

423
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,330
No nation has yet claimed ownership.

424
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,930
The CIA is up my ass about this mystery...

425
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,810
..raid in the middle east.

426
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,050
So it's time to come clean, was the unit involved?

427
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,450
Uh, I'm not sure, Ma'am.

428
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,540
All right guys, this is how you do a Decepticon...

429
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,800
...head kill shot.

430
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,500
As director of National Intelligence,

431
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,470
I'm a really big fan of intelligent answers.

432
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,260
I...I can't really tell you definitively.

433
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,110
These Autobots are like teenage kids.

434
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,560
They like to sneak out of the house once in a while.

435
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,180
Colonel Lennox, are you in command or are you not?

436
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,500
Yes, Ma'am. I am....

437
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,520
Stop with the Ma'am, enough with the Ma'am.

438
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,790
Do I look like a Ma'am?

439
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:54,760
No, ma'am.

440
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,470
Yes, ma'am, yes.

441
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,960
- This one is a perfect invention I have made. - Right.

442
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:02,110
Oh, good they're here.

443
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,560
My name's Que. I do hope you have answers for him.

444
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,990
I've never seen him so upset.

445
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:08,010
Optimus, you remember Charlotte Mearing?

446
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,480
Our director of National Intelligence.

447
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,400
He's in a bad mood.

448
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,750
He's a not want to talk-a to anybody today.

449
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,350
What is this?

450
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,030
The silent treatment?

451
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,920
We've seen that, and this is not that.

452
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,510
- Definitely not. - This is worse.

453
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,040
Prime, make something of yourself.

454
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,400
He's pissed.

455
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,020
You lied to us.

456
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,960
Everything humans' know of our planet

457
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,140
we were told had all been shared.

458
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:42,320
So why was this found in human possession?

459
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,270
We were in the dark on this also.

460
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:47,370
It was director only clearance at Sector 7, until now.

461
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,830
- The bag. - Which bag?

462
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,910
Hermes Birkin, green ostrich.

463
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,460
Oh my god.

464
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,860
This is a secret few men knew.

465
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,770
And fewer still remain alive.

466
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,170
Allow me to please introduce to you,

467
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,680
two of NASA's founding mission directors.

468
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,030
and astronaut, Dr. Buzz Aldrin.

469
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:10,180
One of the first two men to step foot on the moon. Sir.

470
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,490
Optimus Prime.

471
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,060
From a fellow space traveler.

472
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,870
It's a true honor.

473
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,710
The honor is mine.

474
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:22,110
Our entire space race of the 1960's...

475
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,760
...it appears was in response to an event.

476
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,370
Our astronauts investigated a crashed alien ship.

477
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,990
No survivors on board.

478
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:35,480
We were sworn to secrecy by our commander in chief.

479
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:39,090
This was a mission you will never speak of.

480
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,010
I understand, sir.

481
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:44,530
A total of 35 people knew the real plan at NASA.

482
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:47,780
Soviets managed to land unmanned probes.

483
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:51,090
Somehow they must have picked up that fuel rod.

484
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,930
We believe the Russians deduced

485
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,470
that the rod was a fissionable fuel assembly.

486
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:58,930
Believed they had it mastered and harnessed it at Chernobyl.

487
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:58,930


488
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:01,090
We went on six missions in all.

489
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,980
We took hundreds of photos and samples.

490
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,740
We locked them away forever.

491
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,670
And the moon program was shut down.

492
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:10,140
Where did you search the crash hold?

493
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:15,070
The ships name was the Ark.

494
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,490
I watched it escape Cybertron myself.

495
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,410
It was carrying an Autobot

496
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,040
technology which would have won us the war.

497
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,590
And its captain.

498
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,450
- Who was this captain? - The Great Sentinel Prime.

499
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,300
The technology's inventor.

500
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,740
He was commander of the Autobots.

501
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,950
Before me.

502
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,060
It's imperative that I find it

503
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:40,160
before the Decepticons learn of its location.

504
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,010
Our Autobot space craft has the ability to get there.

505
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,690
And, you must pray it's in time.

506
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,080
Hi, I'm here to see Carly Spenser.

507
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,130
Carly!

508
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:14,990
You got the job?

509
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,510
- This is crazy. - You really got it?

510
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,880
- Yes. - See what did I tell you, it's the bunny.

511
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,710
You are so welcome.

512
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,760
- Do you like me a little more? - A little bit, yeah.

513
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,800
I'm seriously curious about

514
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,730
this space mountain.

515
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,040
I know, isn't it beautiful in here?

516
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,230
And he's the coolest guy, ever.

517
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,070
- Yeah. - Yeah.

518
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:32,940
Sam.

519
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,310
Dylan Gould.

520
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,330
Pleasure to meet you.

521
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,500
Pleasure meeting you.

522
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,070
Carly has told me a lot about you.

523
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,770
Well, visa versa. It's a beautiful building you got.

524
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:46,900
The Star Ship Enterprise here.

525
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,720
Thank you very much, it leaks.

526
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,650
Ah, before Carly came to help on the collection

527
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,680
it was just a complete mess.

528
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,510
But now the restorations are back on track.

529
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,860
I'm going to pebble beach this year,

530
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,930
going to need a trophy for that stand right there.

531
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:58,980
You know why?

532
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,940
Because this woman right here,

533
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,310
...is my secret weapon. Okay.

534
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,480
Mr. Gould please, you exaggerate.

535
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,070
All I've done is get you organized.

536
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,400
Oh you have done much more than that, my Dutchess.

537
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,100
Nicknames, that's fun.

538
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,970
Yeah, the Dutchess.

539
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,720
She's adorable.

540
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,630
You know when I stole her away from the British Embassy,

541
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,700
I said, it's easy to manage a country.

542
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,860
Try managing a priceless collection of art.

543
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:26,760
Take a look at this 1939 Delahaye 165 Cabriolet.

544
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,160
Designed by a French man.

545
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,930
Look at the curves, elegant isn't it?

546
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,350
Beautiful.

547
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,350
Sensual.

548
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,280
Built to evoke the body of the ideal woman.

549
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,290
Come on.

550
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,730
My dad had a ten dollar desk and a dream.

551
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,580
And he built it into an empire.

552
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:48,550
We're the largest accounting firm in the US.

553
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,040
I started off the adventure side after he passed.

554
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,390
That's in the future.

555
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,940
Try and bet on the winners.

556
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,960
See collecting cars helps me keep my sanity.

557
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,020
These look great.

558
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:10,770
Oh, that was a great day, Mr. Gould.

559
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,800
- I didn't see that one. - No, me either.

560
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,060
Jeans are tight.

561
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,430
Oh, here we go, here we go.

562
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,510
You see that?

563
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,620
Judgment, judge to my car.

564
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,140
You going to wait on him while he's judging me?

565
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,800
What's with you? He's my boss.

566
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,540
He still pays for our food, our rent.

567
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,530
No, I totally understand.

568
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:28,190
I'm totally fine, I get it. I'm well fed.

569
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,900
Guess what, I'm not your boy toy anymore.

570
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:30,900
I got my big boy pants on now.

571
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,730
You see them?

572
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,080
In the car, thank you Duchess.

573
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,260
Oh, my god, are you threatened by him?

574
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,700
Threatened, what am I threatened by?

575
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,370
His money, his power, his good looks?

576
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,810
None of the above, check!

577
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,870
Your temper tantrums are so sexy.

578
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,090
Get in the car, please.

579
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,330
Sam, he's hardly the first man to ever smile at me.

580
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,210
I think I can handle it.

581
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,820
Hold on, hold on. It's..It's the smiling back part that gets me.

582
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,970
- Okay. - No more smiles.

583
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,430
Never again, I promise.

584
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,680
You see, that works for me.

585
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:09,350
Easy, easy.

586
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,740
You're not going to get it started that way.

587
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,490
What, I was just getting it ready.

588
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,890
I'm about 32% done with my restoration.

589
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,350
Chrome work, put a spoiler on the back, done deal.

590
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,690
You know Carly's been telling me you've been struggling job loss.

591
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:19,970
Just so you know.

592
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,950
I'm on the board for Accuretta systems.

593
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,820
And I put in a call for you.

594
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,410
Just keep it between us, okay.

595
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,900
She's so kind to me.

596
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,890
You're a lucky man.

597
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:35,280
Xanthium approaching Tranquility base.

598
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,370
Here's Houston, you're a go Xanthium.

599
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,260
Armstrong, having a good day.

600
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,810
Ratchet, let's roll.

601
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,160
Did they get that mag cap on?

602
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,750
Copy contact.

603
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,220
We're entering the Ark.

604
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,700
His levels are faint.

605
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,600
Locked himself away.

606
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,530
To guard the pillars.

607
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,340
Sentinel.

608
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,890
You're coming home, old friend.

609
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:27,390
All hail, Megatron.

610
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,720
My master, it's master.

611
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,860
Ah, don't be greedy.

612
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:46,940
My fragile ones.

613
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,790
You look poor, Master.

614
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:56,380
How it pains me to see you so vulnerable, so weak.

615
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:59,530
Spare me you gaseous sycophant.

616
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:02,660
You know what you were told. Resist nothing.

617
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:12,840
Soundwave reporting, Lord Megatron.

618
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,970
And what news from my assassin?

619
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,310
Autobots have taken the bait.

620
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,990
They discovered the Ark,

621
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,250
and returned with its cargo.

622
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:28,020
You did me great honor, tracking that ship to the moon.

623
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,660
Your human collaborators have served their purpose, Soundwave.

624
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:37,310
It's time to eliminate loose ends.

625
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,650
Laserbeak, kill them all.

626
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,510
With pleasure.

627
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,500
Is your daddy home?

628
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,340
Then the daddy said it's our time.

629
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,780
Hello, mom.

630
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,300
Get out of the house!

631
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:13,040
- What are you doing in my house? - Just visiting.

632
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,540


633
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:21,660


634
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,630
What's this hoochee around here?

635
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,240
Just because...

636
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,920
No. This is the aerospace baby.

637
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,300
You are not allowed back here.

638
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,780
New guy, you see that?

639
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,080
That's a Latin melt down, okay.

640
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,200
You ever show up in my office with a regional outfit you're fired.

641
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,170
You got that, okay?

642
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:45,120
If you're going to be on this job for 2 1/2 years, okay.

643
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,350
I want you to live it, love it and made it.

644
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:49,620
There's no ladder climbing in my office. I run a tight ship.

645
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,310
- Yes, sir. - Okay, so move.

646
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,210
I found that paper I was telling you about.

647
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,550
What are we looking at?

648
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,450
Shut up!

649
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,200
You do that to me again and I'll kick your ass.

650
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,780
- Hi Angel. - Hello.

651
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:27,740
You're good?

652
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,380
I had a meeting downtown, is it okay for me to stop by?

653
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,700
I don't know my 500 page

654
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,710
employee conduct manual isn't exactly a page turner.

655
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,850
This is grey.

656
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,340
Autobots are out there saving the world,

657
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,670
and I organize four binders.

658
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,330
It may be a dream, come on.

659
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,810
Visitor violation.

660
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,530
You okay?

661
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,960
Absolutely.

662
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,770
I'm next.

663
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,820
Listen, Saturday.

664
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,990
There's a party at the house it's a work thing,

665
00:37:58,990 --> 00:37:59,840
but Dylan's invited you too.

666
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,770
Really, oh did he.

667
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:02,520
No need to come off with bad jokes.

668
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,990
It would really mean a lot to me, okay.

669
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,090
I'd love to go. How did you get over here?

670
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,640
A car.

671
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,760
You don't have a car.

672
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,140
Yes I do.

673
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:11,600
What, did you win it in a raffle?

674
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,450
Uh, he gave me one.

675
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,490
He gave you a car?

676
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:16,010
Yeah, I think it was a work perk.

677
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,570
Hmm, a work perk.

678
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,800
What kind of car did he gave you?

679
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,410
Um, a Mercedes SLS AMG.

680
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,660
Really crazy engine.

681
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,740
Mercedes Benz SLS.

682
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,810
You rode this here?

683
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,130
It's a $200,000 Car.

684
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:34,830
I know.

685
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,010
You know how long it would take me to afford a car like this?

686
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,900
- Long time. - Yeah like, 53 years.

687
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,220
I said it was a perk, first.

688
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,680
You know what we should do? We should sell it and buy a house.

689
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,440
You're frustrated, I know.

690
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,630
I've been there.

691
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,210
It's called paying your dues.

692
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,410
Good things will happen.

693
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:53,470
Ladies and gentlemen.

694
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,260
I need some lunchtime filing done, stat.

695
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:59,390
Who would like to score some Bruce Brazos points?

696
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:01,110
Bruce, you found your guy.

697
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,330
Witwicky.

698
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,760
The man who makes this company run.

699
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,790
Now who have we here, a sister, facebook friend?

700
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:12,690
Twitter, tweeter.

701
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,990
- Carly this is Bruce. Bruce. - Hi.

702
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,810
I'm his girlfriend, pleasure to meet you.

703
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,350
Sam was right, you really do have smashing head of hair.

704
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:21,070
- Well thank you. - Your welcome.

705
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:22,990
Sam I gotta run.

706
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,260
Here, your present.

707
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,460
Your favorite color.

708
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:31,530
Nice to meet you Mr. Brazos.

709
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:32,370
And you.

710
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,750
See ya boys.

711
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,760
I'm still stewing about that binder incident, Jerry.

712
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,450
May I finish my Chu Wah milk, Tony.

713
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,690
I don's care about your exotic milk.

714
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,120
I care about respect.

715
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:11,680
I know who you are.

716
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,720
Wicky, Witwicky.

717
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,170
- You know who, I'm talking to you. - Excuse me.

718
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:16,980
Thank you.

719
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:19,930
No, no, slow down tiger.

720
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:21,900
You showed up on the background of six different photos.

721
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,380
Two contains of aliens.

722
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,710
That was you in Egypt.

723
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,650
Huh, right.

724
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:28,400
Because you know the Aliens.

725
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,250
See ya.

726
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,530
Give me my jacket.

727
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,350
Hey, I am Wang, Deep Wang.

728
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:44,050
Deep Wang.

729
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,910
You're not getting it, "Deep Throat".

730
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,070
Okay, cause they told you.

731
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:52,680
Shhh, they watch and listen.

732
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,760
I can't go to the government.

733
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,280
You, you can because shit's going down.

734
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,680


735
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,680
Son, it is code pink as in 'Floyd'.

736
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,820
Dark side, why do you think no ones been up there since 1972.

737
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:06,060
You speak in English, it's a very strange English.

738
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,910
That's why un. Oh....oh.

739
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,330
Don't, I'm gonna hit ya.

740
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,760
Well I'm going to hit ya right back, son.

741
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,850
That's my manifesto.

742
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,200
Your riding this out.

743
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,220
They are wiping us out. Everyone who knows this is in the dark.

744
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:18,980
Your alien friends is in danger.

745
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,650
You know the good ones, it's up to you.

746
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,490
Easy, Sam.

747
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:35,800
What are you looking at?

748
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:37,810
Yow, dog.

749
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:40,090
Did you look at my shit?

750
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:41,870
Who are you working for?

751
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,730
Stare down, you and me.

752
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:47,930
Guess I won.

753
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:53,050
Moons ... list.

754
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,450
More suspends program.

755
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:58,460
Experts dead.

756
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,450
Space Program ends.

757
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,640
Dark side.

758
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,020
Dark side of the moon.

759
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:05,170
Look what I found outside the bathroom, huh?

760
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:06,720
It yours? Deal with this.

761
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:07,790
Yes, sir.

762
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,490
I did everything you want.

763
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,670
I really think we should talk,

764
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,630
because some of the stuff...

765
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,400
Whoa, knock first.

766
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:17,750
Can't you see I'm busy.

767
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:19,500
Who are you, who are you?

768
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,330
You straddled me in the stall.

769
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,250
That's happened to me once in this life, I wouldn't forget it.

770
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,950
- No, no. - In the bathroom stall.

771
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,060
You pulled your package out.

772
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:31,540
Whoa, whoa, we are not boyfriends, okay.

773
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,690
One phone call from me and I'll have you fired.

774
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:35,350
Oh yes I will, Gaylord.

775
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,260
You okay?

776
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,240
It's a hemorrhoid.

777
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:42,040
Should I come back? When should I come back?

778
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,050
Come back when you learn some manners.

779
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,640
I don't know him, I would never say anything.

780
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:57,190
no one would touch the dark side, just like I promised.

781
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:59,250
I will blend them into the program bogus

782
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:00,730
What more do you want from me?

783
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:02,290
Jerry.

784
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,020
You are my favorite.

785
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,550
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

786
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,660
I know.

787
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:10,340
My superiors need me to....

788
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,930
- What? - Suicide you.

789
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:18,550
What did you say to Witwicky?

790
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,820
Shit.

791
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:25,060
Huh, who want's some chicken dinner now, bitch?

792
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,480
'Cause somebody messed with the wrong Wang today.

793
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,010
Come on, you want some of me.

794
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,370
I don't need anymore didactic lectures from Chuck.

795
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:47,730
Jesus!

796
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,510
Get it legal.

797
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,020
That's Jerry.

798
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,560
Come on, people. Yes, a workmate died.

799
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,800
But looking out windows is not going to bring him back.

800
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,990
The man was depressed.

801
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:05,150
Don't take a picture.

802
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:07,400
You can keep watching him but he's not getting up.

803
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,220


804
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,220
You all read Humpty Dumpty.

805
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,390
Okay.

806
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:11,790
Witwicky.

807
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:13,540
When this comes out in the press,

808
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,460
you clean up. Wang is everywhere.

809
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:19,400
He is in the bristle. He's in the bamboo.

810
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:20,970
He's on the balustrade.

811
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:22,560
Did you see the sidewalk down there?

812
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:23,940
Oh, man.

813
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:27,090
You forget his person, get his name off his parking space.

814
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:28,400
Hey, when did we get a new copier?

815
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,670
See, I'm not gonna say anything about what I saw?

816
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:34,550
Who you share a toilet stall with is totally your business.

817
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:37,890
This is exceedingly Japanese.

818
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,720
They never make it easy.

819
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:20,730
What is with you?

820
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:21,940
This is the really deal, Carly.

821
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,170
Okay, I need you to stay composed.

822
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:25,220
It's real life, I'll explain to you later.

823
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,450
We got an emergency, you gotta get Colonel Lennox in here.

824
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:33,020
On point decepticons, the deceptions are back again.

825
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,500
- You gotta open that gate up right now. - Easy, sir.

826
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,820
This is health and human services.

827
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:38,340
Right, packing M-4's?

828
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,360


829
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:39,720
What are you protecting, colostomy bags?

830
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,270
- Bed pans, throat lozenges? - Babe.

831
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,810
Where did you get that hat from? Nursing school?

832
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:44,520
So your are nurses and foot powder protector.

833
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,870
- Oh, fantastic, yes. - Baby, I don't think we're in....

834
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:47,150
- ... the right place. - We are in the right place.

835
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:48,120
We are in the right place.

836
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:48,940
We are in the right place,

837
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,070
and I want to talk to Optimus right now.

838
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:51,150
You're going to get me Optimus right now.

839
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:51,990
I'm sure you got the wrong building.

840
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:52,860
I don't know what you're talking about.

841
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,790
What part of the Deceptions are back don't you understand?

842
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:57,600
You're being a smart ass.

843
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,540
Do not hit my car, it's a collector's item.

844
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:02,150
I wouldn't do that.

845
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:03,200
You're crazy.

846
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,100
We got an Energon reading.

847
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:08,590
We got Missed it by that much in the vehicle.

848
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:17,380
- Freeze! -Whoa, whoa, whoa, we're freezing.

849
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,260
Are you...

850
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:21,540
Please get out of the car.

851
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,090
- I got him, go. - Bee!

852
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:27,310
Is Bee in there?

853
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:29,910
- Okay, you got me. - Stay down.

854
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,470
This how you treat Autobots?

855
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:32,680
We're on the same team.

856
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:35,410
Yeah, enjoy your next job at 7-11, dickhead.

857
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:37,270
- That's right. - A-hole.

858
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:38,550
How's your car now?

859
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:49,420
That's my car.

860
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:51,620
Come here.

861
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:52,930
Come here!

862
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,950
Come on... Sam.

863
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,560
What is your deal, huh?

864
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:58,320
I know your black ops stuff is important.

865
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,310
You know I'm not trying to diminish it,

866
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:00,550
or guilt trip you, or anything.

867
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:01,740
But I just never see you anymore.

868
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:04,300
You can't come to the garage and stay on one night?

869
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:06,710
Sam, that makes me feel bad.

870
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:08,680
Yeah, well, I hope you feel bad, you should feel bad.

871
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:09,740
Look at the jalopy I'm driving now.

872
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:10,980
I feel bad every single day.

873
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,750
Yo, let's go, both of you.

874
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:13,740
Lennox wants to see you.

875
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,210
What, we're not good enough for you anymore.

876
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:16,980
Sorry, babe, they were very rude, right.

877
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:19,890
And you're fixing my car.

878
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,540
You don't think so?

879
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,600
Raise your hand if you had a

880
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,050
flying psycho ninja copier try to kill you today.

881
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,330
Those are my brass knuckles.

882
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:28,280
That's my anklet, do I have to take that off too?

883
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,390
And my toe rings?

884
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,310
All the unofficials clear the floor.

885
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,370
We have ten minutes until attempted contact.

886
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:35,060
We've taken possession of

887
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,980
the five devices that were hidden in the ship of Sentinel Prime.

888
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:41,220
They're some kind of prototype Autobot technology.

889
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,960
They say Sentinel was the Einstein of his civilization.

890
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,490
So we're going to keep these locked up,

891
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:48,020
... until we know what we're dealing with.

892
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:50,270
Right now no one gets access.

893
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,470
- No one. - This morning a guy recognized me.

894
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:54,860
He told me to warn you,

895
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:56,080
he's talking about the dark side of the moon.

896
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,090
- Then they killed him. - Wait a minute, you mentioned the moon?

897
00:47:58,090 --> 00:47:59,290
Yeah, dark side of the moon.

898
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,800
But why would the decepticons want to kill humans?

899
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,090
I thought their war was with the Autobots.

900
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:06,390
And that is when he made his first quick list of time report.

901
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,470
That's what I want..

902
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,440
Who's the chick, okay.

903
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,450
Excuse me, Colonel Lennox.

904
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:12,490
Director Mearing.

905
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:13,790
This is Sam Witwicky.

906
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,510
- A civilian c.. - I know his name, Colonel.

907
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:17,020
I want to know who gave him clearance.

908
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,730
Who gave me Clearance? How about Optimus Prime.

909
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,770
When he touched down in suburbia looking for my house.

910
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,900
This is the national intelligence director.

911
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,190
In case you...

912
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:27,260
- Hi. - Disrespecting a federal officer.

913
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,050
That ought to get you somewhere, who's she?

914
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:30,110
She's my girlfriend.

915
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,140
What is this like a date?

916
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,950
She knows all about the Autobots, okay.

917
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,320
She knows Bumblebee, and comes from a military family.

918
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,250
I can vouch for her.

919
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:38,410
Hey, I have an idea.

920
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:39,860
How bout we get back to the important topics?

921
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:42,370
Like the fact I almost had my face cut off by a Decepticon.

922
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:44,800
As a tax payer I can lodge a complaint as a matter of fact.

923
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,850
Okay, listen.

924
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:48,440
One of the software engineers at Sam's office was murdered today.

925
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:50,500
He was involved in NASA's Lunar mapping probe.

926
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,280
Here's the thing, Colonel Lennox.

927
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:56,050
We cannot entrust national security to teenagers.

928
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:58,000
Unless I missed the policy paper.

929
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,100
Are we doing that now?

930
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:00,240
No, good.

931
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,170
I don't care who you are.

932
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:04,010
If you breathe a word of what you've seen here.

933
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:05,510
You will do time for treason.

934
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:07,030
Do you understand me?

935
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,180
I'll take my orders from the Autobots.

936
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,630
I know them, I don't know you.

937
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:12,390
You will.

938
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:15,960
Sentinel Prime.

939
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:18,680
He seems to run on Energon, and he's out of it.

940
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:20,980
He's in a sort of a sleep mode.

941
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,470
Let us begin.

942
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,380
It's the great matrix of leadership.

943
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,030
He holds the only thing in the

944
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:38,520
universe that can repower a Transformers spark.

945
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:41,020
This is incredible.

946
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:43,800
Sentinel Prime.

947
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,060
We bid you return.

948
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:54,470
Revenge.

949
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:58,280
- No. - Hold your fire.

950
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,640
- No, Sentinel. - Hold your fire.

951
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:04,240
It is I, Optimus Prime.

952
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:05,820
It is all right.

953
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,070
You are safe.

954
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:09,700
There's nothing to fear.

955
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,640
We are here.

956
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,180
You are home, Sentinel.

957
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:22,200
The war?

958
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:23,510
The war!

959
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:25,920
The war was lost.

960
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:29,560
Cybertron is now but a barren wasteland.

961
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:32,420
We have taken refuge here on Planet Earth.

962
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:35,200
Its human race is our allies.

963
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:36,460
My ship?

964
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:38,450
We came under fire.

965
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,670
The pillars.

966
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:42,220
Where are the pillars?

967
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:44,250
You saved five of them.

968
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,110
Including the control pillar.

969
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:47,680
Only five?

970
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:50,070
We once had hundreds.

971
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:51,990
Excuse me, gentlemen. May I ask,

972
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:54,080
what is this technology you're looking for?

973
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:57,030
It is the ability to reshape the universe.

974
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:59,710
Together the pillars form a space bridge.

975
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:03,580
I designed and I alone can control it.

976
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:05,580
It defied your laws of physics

977
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:08,470
to transport matter through time and space.

978
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:11,410
You're talking about a teleportation device, aren't you?

979
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:14,370
Yes, for resources, for refuges.

980
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:16,780
Refuges or troops of soldiers.

981
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:18,280
Weapons, maybe bombs.

982
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,740
A means of an instant strike,

983
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,140
that's its military function, isn't it?

984
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:23,200
It is our technology.

985
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:25,430
And it must be returned.

986
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:27,890
Yes, if humans say so.

987
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:29,840
You can't just bring weapons

988
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,980
of mass destruction into our atmosphere.

989
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:33,670
Kind of have to declare customs first.

990
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,150
A little formality called paperwork.

991
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:37,010
Kinda separates us from the animals.

992
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:40,400
I will overlook your condescending tone

993
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:43,050
if you heave the gravity of mine.

994
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:46,640
The decepticons must never know the space bridge is here.

995
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:47,970
For in their hands...

996
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:52,310
... it would mean the end of your world.

997
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,760
Totaly nightmare file.

998
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,250
So the investigation is open.

999
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:58,670
We sent agents to your office.

1000
00:51:58,670 --> 00:51:59,830
And for the time being,

1001
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:01,570
we're going to send you home with Autobot protection.

1002
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:03,390
Wh.. Who do I need to speak to,

1003
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:05,360
to get you guys to understand I can help.

1004
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:06,560
I can contribute.

1005
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,470
Hey, we can all help. You tell me what you know,

1006
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:10,740
I can tell you all the fun planets I've been.

1007
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:11,780
Get off my desk, please.

1008
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:14,440
Aw, you pulling out guns. Okay, can't help you on that.

1009
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:15,700
Oh, my god.

1010
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,550
What do you envision for me? I go back home now?

1011
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,470
I go back to work? I make copies? I mean...

1012
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,260
This is a unit for veteran

1013
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:23,220
intelligence officers and special forces.

1014
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,550
Not for boys who once owned special cars.

1015
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,670
That's a bit harsh, isn't it ma'am?

1016
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:29,200
Don't call me ma'am, I'm not a ma'am.

1017
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,660
But you're a woman, aren't you?

1018
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,460
Sooo.

1019
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,270
Are those yours?

1020
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,740
Yeah, CIA.

1021
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,920
I only ask because I also have a medal.

1022
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,340
From the President.

1023
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:40,340
Yeah.

1024
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:42,680
Great, so it's not that complicated, right?

1025
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:45,280
No one gets to work with the Autobots unless I approve it.

1026
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,970
You're breaking my chain of command.

1027
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:49,940
Come on, let's go.

1028
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,950
You've done what you can for them.

1029
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:53,440
With all due respect, young man.

1030
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,750
I appreciate what you did.

1031
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:55,890
But you're not a soldier.

1032
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:58,080
You're a messenger, you've always been a messenger.

1033
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:00,320
He's a hero.

1034
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:08,810
Bee, you take the freight elevator, I'll see you up there.

1035
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,900
Ah, this blows.

1036
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,240
- That lady officially kicked us out. - Yeah.

1037
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:19,490
Witness protection program sucks.

1038
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:20,640
Yeah, but we're a whole

1039
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,720
lot safer with big yellow and his cannons.

1040
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,510
That dog can't protect crap.

1041
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,060
Bee.

1042
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,060
You couldn't sleep.

1043
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,380
Yeah, me too.

1044
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:43,770
I don't believe she called me a messenger.

1045
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:46,460
Do you believe that? After everything I've done, I'm a messenger.

1046
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:49,220
Oh, I believe it. I tell ya, Sammy, we feel the same way.

1047
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:51,360
The disrespect on this rock is criminal.

1048
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,640
We should do something about it.

1049
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,100
Bee.

1050
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,020
I need to know why they're killing humans.

1051
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:00,880
What say we call in the expert?

1052
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:04,530
My next guest, is a former American intelligence operative

1053
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:06,220
who has dared to speak out

1054
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:08,420
regarding our alleged military alliance,

1055
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,980
... with what many describe

1056
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:13,470
as a group of extraterrestrial mercenaries.

1057
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:17,860
He is the author of the best selling book, "Code-Name Hero".

1058
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,160
For our special agent, Seymour Simmons.

1059
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,550
Bill, big fan. Great to be here.

1060
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,780
Now, agent Simmons.

1061
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:26,550
You would have us believe that it is in our best centuries

1062
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:30,240
to formally take sides in this so called alien civil war?

1063
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,060
Well, the other side wanted to spank us for breakfast, so.

1064
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:35,250
I wouldn't exactly want to call it a toss up.

1065
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:37,170
These decepticons are lethal.

1066
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:38,800
But polls show half the world

1067
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,980
would feel safer with the Autobots completely gone.

1068
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,160
Get them out of here.

1069
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,800
We don't need them here.

1070
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,900
I feel safer when I sleep with a hand grenade.

1071
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,280
It doesn't mean I'm always right.

1072
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:53,020
Thank you. Here's a fact, we obtained documents that show you were

1073
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:55,310
- fired by the intelligence committee. - Chuck, I'm doing the interview.

1074
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,770
Down sized. Bill, budget cuts.

1075
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:01,750
- Chuck, out. - ... report get severe delusional tendencies.

1076
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:02,840
This is ambush journalism.

1077
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,620
You want the truth about the alien alliance?

1078
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:05,810
Buy my book.

1079
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:07,330
Buy my book!

1080
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:08,880
Before it's to late, people.

1081
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,890
You want to piss me, Bill, you want get naked?

1082
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,510
I'm ready, interview is over.

1083
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,110
- You sound like a pin-head agent. - You get out of my house.

1084
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:15,550
And I got a suggestion for you.

1085
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:16,450
It is over, understand?

1086
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:17,230
Damage control.

1087
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,560
- Dutch! - You have obviously upset Mr. Simmons.

1088
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,810
You have 23 seconds to leave the property.

1089
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:23,320
I have called the police.

1090
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,970
You are peasant people throwing rocks at a giant.

1091
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:27,300
What's up next, what have we got?

1092
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:28,740
Book signing midtown at noon,

1093
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,990
then your pic reality show for discovery HM.

1094
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:32,610
Oh, and I had this, um... um.

1095
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:34,950
The Witwicky who keeps calling me five times today.

1096
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:36,370
The kid, what does he want?

1097
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:38,150
I called because the decepticons

1098
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:39,800
are back and I want to know why, and I need your help.

1099
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:40,930
They're back?

1100
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,390
Well, that's good for business.

1101
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,710
What if I told you I know a 50

1102
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:46,710
year old alien secret that nobody ever told you?

1103
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:50,000
Do not tempt my addiction.

1104
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,280
I have gone through withdrawal, kid.

1105
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:54,540
Dutch, is this line secure?

1106
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:55,380
No.

1107
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:56,970


1108
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,570
Don't take the risk.

1109
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:00,080
I'm rich, why should I?

1110
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:03,140
Do not relapse, I won't.

1111
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,890
Do not let the demons win.

1112
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:06,160


1113
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:06,890
Got.

1114
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,860
What kind of.... secret?

1115
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,100
Apollo, moon, aliens, cover-up...

1116
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,630
... future tech, assassinations, that kind of stuff.

1117
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:18,460
Oh, Apollo.

1118
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:20,790
Dutch!

1119
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:31,160
Tell Megatron, let's tango.

1120
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:44,950
So majestic and peaceful, this planet.

1121
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,260
Unlike the final days of Cybertron.

1122
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,760
I've wondered what might have been.

1123
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,660
If you had fought the final battle.

1124
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:55,260
Instead of me.

1125
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:58,090
Never morn the past, young warrior.

1126
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:02,180
Thanks to you, our race survives.

1127
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:06,540
You were our leader, Sentinel.

1128
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:09,920
It is your right to lead us again.

1129
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:11,680
In a world I do not know.

1130
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:15,450
I am no longer your teacher, Optimus.

1131
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:17,440
You are mine.

1132
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,490
We've got to break this case down.

1133
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:25,810
What we have here is an astronaut epidemic.

1134
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:27,810
M.I.A., dead, died in a car accident,

1135
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:29,440
killed, D.O.A., car death.

1136
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,510
It's like these guys can't drive.

1137
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:31,640
They can fly into outer space.

1138
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,000
But they can't drive a car.

1139
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,620
Procured your information, Witwicky.

1140
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:36,710
Thank you, Bruce.

1141
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,630
Noo.

1142
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,870
You let me see one of them, one time.

1143
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:44,480
- Quick. - Very.

1144
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,940
Here's their reconnaissance order.

1145
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:54,370
It say's NASA launched in 2009.

1146
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:57,270
See, forensics show Wang may have messed with the code

1147
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,950
preventing it from mapping the far side of the moon

1148
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:00,350
which is also the dark side.

1149
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:01,840
Freaking awesome.

1150
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,900
They pay for trade us, intimidate us.

1151
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,510
... coerce us to do their dirty work.

1152
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,790
And once they're done?

1153
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,300
Dushhhh.

1154
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:10,570
The double tap cerebellum.

1155
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,310
So he was working for the Decepticons.

1156
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:15,270
I don't think this is about the Decepticons.

1157
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:17,230
looking for something on the moon.

1158
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:22,090
I think it's about something they wanted to hide.

1159
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:23,790
Come to daddy.

1160
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,540
Come on, fall down.

1161
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,560
Did you eat a lot of paint chips when you were a kid?

1162
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:32,070
The freak.

1163
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:33,790
Hah, like it.

1164
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:38,630
I'll teach you...

1165
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:40,870
Sir.

1166
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,250
Having a pretty high level alien Intel confab here.

1167
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:46,890
That I don't think you're cleared for.

1168
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:48,870
- Errand boy. - Yeah, you're right.

1169
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:51,660
- It's a bitchin' robot. - I think it's time to go, Bruce, okay?

1170
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:52,840
Thank you so much for this.

1171
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,110
Better go, Bruce.

1172
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,570
Hey, I'm smokin' over here.

1173
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:59,680
Now with the missing Russian cosmonauts.

1174
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:02,750
Turns out the soviets cancelled a manned mission to the moon.

1175
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:04,480
The moon, in 1972

1176
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,870
when 2 of cosmonauts went into hiding in America.

1177
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:08,830
And I just found them, aaaah.

1178
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:10,190
You're a genius, Brains.

1179
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:17,130
Oh, that was smooth, Bumble Bee.

1180
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,870
Missed it by that much.

1181
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:26,510
Hi.

1182
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:29,220
Would somebody tell me what the hell's going on?

1183
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,230
Who are you?

1184
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:32,170
- Who are you? - Who am I?

1185
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,350
Who is that? Dutch, frisk her.

1186
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:36,460
- Certainly. - Here, no.

1187
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:37,720
Dutch, um...

1188
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:38,690
Don't touch me.

1189
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,750
- I'm not going to... - Sam?

1190
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,110
Angel.

1191
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:44,670
Uh, I was working.

1192
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:45,960
I'm sorry about this.

1193
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:46,830
Great, we're homeless.

1194
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:47,790
She lives here?

1195
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:50,600
You had your chance to frisk her.

1196
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:51,920
I have a girl friend.

1197
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:53,140
Really, what's her name?

1198
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,110
Innn...dia.

1199
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:58,620
We're suppose to be at Dylan's party, remember?

1200
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,250
I do remember, but you know, my friends,

1201
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:01,780
...they need me. I have to be here right now.

1202
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:02,850
And what, the Autobots and the

1203
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:04,730
military they can't handle this on their own.

1204
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,250
You know what I liked about your war stories, Sam?

1205
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:08,630
It's that they were stories.

1206
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:09,710
They were in the past.

1207
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:11,150
Look, I know you're thinking about your brother.

1208
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:12,800
Okay, and you're thinking about your family.

1209
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,160
And it's not that situation.

1210
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:15,070
- No? - No.

1211
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:16,040
Why not?

1212
01:00:16,330 --> 01:00:17,520
Why isn't it, Sam?

1213
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:20,730
You think we'd rather has his medals, or we'd rather have him?

1214
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:23,880
I hear you, I get it.

1215
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:25,850
Where are you taking my bunny, stop.

1216
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:27,460
Just stop for a second.

1217
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:29,010
You think I could sleep last night?

1218
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:31,450
I mean it hit me. No, Sam want's the big danger.

1219
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:32,600
He doesn't know who he is without it.

1220
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,660
I just wanna matter.

1221
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,320
You matter to me.

1222
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:44,490
I know you're worried, I know you're worried.

1223
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:46,670
But I promise you I can, I can handle this.

1224
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:48,810
Can you, you can promise it?

1225
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:50,010
I promise.

1226
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,690
Sam, I don't want to loose you, and I know where this leads.

1227
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:58,900
I'm not ready for this.

1228
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,320
Are you coming with me?

1229
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:03,840
I can't.

1230
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:06,770
Okay.

1231
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:18,620
Here's your foot.

1232
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,780
A warrior's path is a solitary one.

1233
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:35,390
How the hell does she afford that car?

1234
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,110
- Her boss. - Rich bastards.

1235
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:39,330
I used to hate them.

1236
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:40,590
But now it's...

1237
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,710
Going to a gang on a hunt for two Russian Cosmonauts.

1238
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:48,160
Nothing like driving in a Maybach, huh?

1239
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:50,400
Germans know how to make cars, let me tell ya.

1240
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:53,910
My Dutch man. Former NSA,

1241
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:56,100
Cyber sleuth extraordinaire.

1242
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:57,780
Tracked them down, here.

1243
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:01,250
So these cosmonauts wanted to hide. Why?

1244
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,630
Bingo, I got a match.

1245
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:06,160
You're a German Shepard, Dutch.

1246
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,550
The thing about Russians is...

1247
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,030
...they never like to talk.

1248
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:12,330
It's going to take a little of the international language.

1249
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:18,840
- Dos vedanya. - That means goodbye.

1250
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:33,090
Who's to get revolution.

1251
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:35,850
A famous, I have no idea.

1252
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:36,900
Dutch.

1253
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:38,350
Give me something tough.

1254
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:43,380
- Baryshnikov. - We do speak English.

1255
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:45,370
Dutch, you suck.

1256
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,280
It's a Cyrillic, alphabet.

1257
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:51,450
It's like all the buttons you never push on a calculator.

1258
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:53,610
I don't suck.

1259
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:57,310
Agent Seymour Simmons, CETI. Formerly Seta.

1260
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,550
We know who you are.

1261
01:02:58,770 --> 01:02:59,990
Cosmonaut chicks.

1262
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:01,220
So what?

1263
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:04,860
You were suppose to travel to the Dark side of the moon, then....

1264
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:07,020
It all got shut down.

1265
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,310
The question is.

1266
01:03:11,050 --> 01:03:11,890
Why?

1267
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:18,490
Can my child smoke in here?

1268
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,120
Okay, all right. Okay!

1269
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,860
- Yeah, shoot me. - Who was this delish, huh?

1270
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:33,900
I'm only the driver in my country are you?

1271
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:37,680
You are beautiful.

1272
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,040
Has anyone told you, you're beautiful?

1273
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:40,460
'Cause she's a beautiful woman.

1274
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:51,430
Dutch, back in the cage.

1275
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:56,320
Control your boy, please control your boy.

1276
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:57,750
Dutch, stop!

1277
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:05,400
I'm so sorry. That is the old me.

1278
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:07,080
Okay, let's everybody just calm down.

1279
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,600
Let's lower the heat, lower the guns. Just relax.

1280
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:11,060
World War 2 is over.

1281
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:16,930
You're about to see one of the biggest soviet secrets.

1282
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:21,350
America first to send men to the moon.

1283
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:23,860
But U.S.S.R. First to send camera.

1284
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:27,560
In 1959 our Lunar 3.

1285
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:31,070
take picture of the Dark, the shadow side.

1286
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:33,730
See's nothing.

1287
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:39,980
- But in 1963 Lunar 4 sees.. - ... strange rocks.

1288
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,830
- Yeah. - Around the ship.

1289
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:43,480
Hundreds of them.

1290
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:45,080
Here, show picture.

1291
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:49,230
With some, drag marks.

1292
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:54,530
I've seen these, these aren't rocks.

1293
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:55,670
These are pillars.

1294
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,770
Alien pillars for a space bridge.

1295
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:00,340
We know about them because the Autobots have five of these.

1296
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:01,780
The decepticons must have

1297
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:04,690
raided the ship before Apollo 11 ever got there.

1298
01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:07,120
Took the pillars and hid them.

1299
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:09,360
Well that doesn't make sense. The Decepticons have the ship.

1300
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,310
They have all those pillars.

1301
01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:11,620
Why would they leave several...

1302
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:13,260
... of these if he's the only one that can use them?

1303
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:14,740
Unless...

1304
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:17,130
He's the one thing they still need.

1305
01:05:18,110 --> 01:05:19,400
We got to meet up with Sentinel.

1306
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:21,040
Rendezvous with him, and keep him safe.

1307
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:23,790
Mearing, I just picked up Sentinel, Optimus is 10 minutes behind.

1308
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:25,060
We're coming in fast, now.

1309
01:05:27,350 --> 01:05:29,090
Mr. Witwicky I thought I made it clear to you,

1310
01:05:29,090 --> 01:05:30,680
that I did not want you calling this phone.

1311
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:33,270
Listen, the whole thing has been a set up since the beginning.

1312
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:35,570
Decepticons wanted Optimus to find Sentinel,

1313
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:37,510
because only Optimus could revive him.

1314
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:39,220
But we have the space bridge.

1315
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:40,980
Mearing, you have five pillars.

1316
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,460
I just learned that they have hundreds.

1317
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:43,900
You're doing exactly what they wanted you to do.

1318
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:45,400
What do I need to say to you.

1319
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,820
The Decepticons are coming for Sentinel Prime.

1320
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:49,320
We're going to NEST.

1321
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:55,500
We have an Energon alert.

1322
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,290
Currently tracking.

1323
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:01,490
Three black suburban.

1324
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:38,570
B, you gotta get Sentinel out of here, you got to floor it.

1325
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:50,010
Oh man, oh I'm fine.

1326
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:55,690
Watch out, watch out.

1327
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:13,960
Gotcha.

1328
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:16,660
Shoot him, shoot him!

1329
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:17,660
Shoot him, B.

1330
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:48,260
B, you gotta move. Faster, faster B, go!

1331
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:53,030
Wipeout.

1332
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:16,210
Come on, back to NEST.

1333
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:24,830
Dino, I got him.

1334
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:01,040
Is there a problem?

1335
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:05,000
Whoa, little Mexican stand-off we got here.

1336
01:09:05,370 --> 01:09:06,570
Weapons down.

1337
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:10,010
And we'll let you escape with your dignity.

1338
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:15,060
Drop them.

1339
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:18,650
That's good.

1340
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:24,270
Ironhide, watch out.

1341
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:31,980
Ironhide, catch.

1342
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:38,490
Behind you.

1343
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:44,330
Decepticon punk.

1344
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:53,850
Class dismissed.

1345
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:01,770
- Inside, let's go. - Move.

1346
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:03,210
Quick, move it.

1347
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:04,920
- Lennox. - Go, go, go, go.

1348
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:06,250
We got decepticons everywhere.

1349
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:07,680
I got my whole team deployed looking for them.

1350
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:08,710
Ironhide!

1351
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:11,010
Protect Sentinel, get him locked up inside.

1352
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:12,310
Consider it done.

1353
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:14,310
You gotta guard him, because he's the key to the whole thing.

1354
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:16,180
Indeed I am.

1355
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:19,460
What you must realized, my Autobot brothers.

1356
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:21,950
Is we were never going to win the war.

1357
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:24,680
For the sake of our planets survival.

1358
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,890
A deal had to be made.

1359
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:29,500
With Megatron.

1360
01:10:36,410 --> 01:10:37,150
Get back!

1361
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,900
What have you done?

1362
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:43,500
I hereby discharge you from duty.

1363
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:51,290
- B! - Get back.

1364
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:08,440
Bring all the NEST forces back to the base.

1365
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:09,530
Come on, move.

1366
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:21,020
Get them in, get them here. We don't have enough men.

1367
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:23,070
Do not engage Sentinel.

1368
01:11:23,770 --> 01:11:25,210
Just go to the back gate.

1369
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:31,500
Director, down.

1370
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:36,790
Let's slide, let's slide

1371
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:38,830
Go, follow me.

1372
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:40,780
Start firing.

1373
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:49,420
- Wait don't. - Get out.

1374
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:51,270
Hey, Sentinel.

1375
01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:52,990
What is going on?

1376
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:54,600
What do you think you're doing?

1377
01:11:58,070 --> 01:11:59,450
I am a Prime.

1378
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:02,020
I do not take orders from you.

1379
01:12:03,790 --> 01:12:05,950
Director Mearing come on. We can't fight him, let's go.

1380
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:07,270
- We have to go. - Now.

1381
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:09,870
Return what belongs to me.

1382
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:13,550
Oh, my god.

1383
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:30,240
Everybody out, everybody out.

1384
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,650
Everybody stay calm.

1385
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:43,320
Yeah take a look, Optimus.

1386
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:44,760
This is all on you.

1387
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:46,260
The Sentinel hit the vault.

1388
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:47,380
Took the pillars.

1389
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:49,880
Come on, let's go.

1390
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,090
All right, notify the 101st airborne.

1391
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:54,120
We need to hunt this thing down.

1392
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,060
Carly.

1393
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:07,460
Hot from a little camp fire.

1394
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:08,610
Smores.

1395
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:11,210
Isn't this great, we are really living off the land.

1396
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:14,170
Ma, Dad. Have you guys seen Carly come home yet?

1397
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:15,880
Excuse me, can you knock please.

1398
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:16,870
This is our bedroom.

1399
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:17,890
Why wouldn't she be at home?

1400
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:19,280
We had a fight, and....

1401
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,390
We might have broken up, or be on a break.

1402
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:22,290
I don't really know.

1403
01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:24,030
- What!?.. Noo. - Look, I can't talk about it.

1404
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:25,320
- You gotta be kidding me. - I

1405
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:26,880
can't go into details now, Mom. I have to find her.

1406
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,740
Sam, we're having a family meeting.

1407
01:13:28,830 --> 01:13:29,740
Family meeting.

1408
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:31,280
You may not know this. But your

1409
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,520
father and I were not always this perfectly happy.

1410
01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:35,400
You know there was a time in our marriage when I thought,

1411
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:36,710
"This is not going to work out."

1412
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:38,120
- Can you please hurry up. - I'm just hope you ...

1413
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:39,580
- .. just understand that you... - She's damaging me.

1414
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:41,350
...break up with one world class high.

1415
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:43,060
- No, stop, stop, okay. - Yeah.

1416
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:44,440
She dumped me, I moved to something better.

1417
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:45,490
That's it, I'm a happier person.

1418
01:13:45,490 --> 01:13:46,500
It's not going to be as beautiful...

1419
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:48,260
- Lose her, why did you lose her? - Help me.

1420
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:49,530
- They had an argument. - We had a fight.

1421
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:50,840
Okay, but you're not going to get a third one.

1422
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:52,660
I mean unless you have like a big...

1423
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:54,370
What the, mom!

1424
01:13:54,370 --> 01:13:55,530
Mom, mom, don't want to talk about it.

1425
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:56,290
I mean you just don't know.

1426
01:13:56,290 --> 01:13:58,290
- Just don't want to talk. - You need a book.

1427
01:13:58,720 --> 01:13:59,760
You'll always wrong.

1428
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,870
- Get used to it. -Okay, this you gotta read this.

1429
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:03,450
She comes first, there's some killer...

1430
01:14:03,450 --> 01:14:05,030
- ...shit in here. - No, No, No.

1431
01:14:05,030 --> 01:14:06,500
- Ah, let's get this. - No, no.

1432
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:08,570
- No, no. - Sit down. Sit down!

1433
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:09,810
Back me up.

1434
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:12,380
Happy wife, happy life.

1435
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:14,070
- Yeah. - unhappy wife

1436
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:16,460
Stone cold misery for the rest of your...

1437
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:17,670
- Stop. - It's true.

1438
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:18,860
All I'm saying is.

1439
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:20,140
Do you love this girl?

1440
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:21,190
She's the one.

1441
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:22,830
Then you gotta go get her.

1442
01:14:23,010 --> 01:14:25,070
I mean, your dad and I, when we had troubles.

1443
01:14:25,070 --> 01:14:27,650
He moved heaven and earth to find me.

1444
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:29,710
Would he, say what you said.

1445
01:14:30,150 --> 01:14:30,670
Say it.

1446
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:33,080
I would follow you to the end of time.

1447
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:34,970
- Does that suck or what? - No.

1448
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:36,390
Bad syfy dope.

1449
01:14:37,610 --> 01:14:39,840
I want you guys to get as far away from here as you can.

1450
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:41,230
You understand?

1451
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:42,820
I love you.

1452
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,290
Oh, my master.

1453
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:06,250
Such a brilliant scheme.

1454
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:08,830
So, when Sentinel left Cybertron,

1455
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:10,660
...it was to defect.

1456
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:14,360
He was meant to rendezvous with me here on Earth,

1457
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,890
before fate waylaid us both.

1458
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:19,520
The only way to revive him,

1459
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:22,880
...we needed Prime and his matrix.

1460
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,170
Excellent strategy.

1461
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,820
So he is now your partner, master.

1462
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,730
He is my greatest triumph.

1463
01:15:43,730 --> 01:15:44,980
So impressive.

1464
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:47,380
Commencing transport.

1465
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:50,470
Stop! No, no, no Sentinel!

1466
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:51,660
Forgive me.

1467
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,640
Here we are.

1468
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:59,600
Fight us now.

1469
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:47,800
Autobots, retreat.

1470
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:16,430
Why Sentinel, why?

1471
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:17,850
For Cybertron.

1472
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:19,100
For our home.

1473
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:22,020
What war destroyed, we can rebuild.

1474
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:25,050
But only if we join with the Decepticons.

1475
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:27,040
No, it's not the only way.

1476
01:17:27,150 --> 01:17:28,550
This is our home.

1477
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:30,210
We must defend the humans.

1478
01:17:30,210 --> 01:17:32,340
So lost you are, Optimus.

1479
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,250
On Cybertron we were Gods.

1480
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,680
And here they call us machines.

1481
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:40,240
Let the humans serve us.

1482
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:41,620
Or perish.

1483
01:17:44,650 --> 01:17:46,260
You're lucky I didn't kill you.

1484
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:49,260
In time, you'll see.

1485
01:17:50,050 --> 01:17:51,570
It's not over.

1486
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:56,260
And if I were him,

1487
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,470
...I wouldn't let you out of my sight for one second.

1488
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:03,530
It's funny I was just thinking on the way over here,

1489
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,060
I really could use some advice from Dylan.

1490
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:06,900
- And there he is. Can I speak to you? - Welcome.

1491
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:08,150
Please sit down, have a drink.

1492
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:10,180
You know what, I don't need a drink.

1493
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:11,710
Or a car, or a job.

1494
01:18:11,710 --> 01:18:13,230
I just need to speak to my girlfriend alone.

1495
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:14,880
Is that okay with you, Mr. Inappropriate?

1496
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:17,820
Excuse me.

1497
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:22,830
- What's going on? - I'll tell you outside.

1498
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:25,360
I really think I can help you, Sam.

1499
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:28,160
I remember a talk I had with my dad once, about tough choices.

1500
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:30,170
Now's not the time, I'll set something up, though.

1501
01:18:30,170 --> 01:18:32,350
'Cause that was way back when my dad's firm was in charge

1502
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:34,810
of budget review and accounting for NASA.

1503
01:18:36,490 --> 01:18:37,790
You see the thing that he taught me was...

1504
01:18:37,790 --> 01:18:39,120
When it's not your war,

1505
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:41,270
you join the side that's going to win.

1506
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:45,740
Too direct, or was it just me?

1507
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:47,240
Certainly not you, sir.

1508
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:01,580
You're mine.

1509
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:09,610
- Get help. Someone get help. - Sam, I can't get out.

1510
01:19:09,610 --> 01:19:11,330
- Goodnight - Goodnight Mr. Dylan.

1511
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:12,810
Sam, get me out of here.

1512
01:19:17,010 --> 01:19:17,860
Help.

1513
01:19:18,110 --> 01:19:19,060
Get help.

1514
01:19:19,210 --> 01:19:21,030
He's young, he will learn.

1515
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:22,640
- Get me out. - Goodnight.

1516
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:23,880
This was a fun night.

1517
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:25,330
You really think you're the

1518
01:19:25,330 --> 01:19:28,390
first man ever asked to join a noble alien cause?

1519
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:29,380
Who are you?

1520
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:30,640
You know why we've not

1521
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,890
been back to the moon since 1972?

1522
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:34,030
Because these two.

1523
01:19:34,830 --> 01:19:35,790
They came to my dad and

1524
01:19:35,790 --> 01:19:37,930
they told him to do some creative accounting.

1525
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:39,760
Make it way to expensive to ever go back.

1526
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,250
So he and others, shut

1527
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:43,020
down the American and Russian space programs.

1528
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:45,470
And they've been our clients ever since.

1529
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:46,690
You helped to kill people?

1530
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:48,110
You think they give you a choice?

1531
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:49,810
Besides, it's not like I personally participated.

1532
01:19:49,810 --> 01:19:50,810
I am a liaison.

1533
01:19:50,970 --> 01:19:52,160
I liaise.

1534
01:19:55,610 --> 01:19:57,070
It's hostile take over time, Sam.

1535
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:00,700
Sam!

1536
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,320
Let her go.

1537
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,000
Sam.

1538
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:13,070
I've had my eye on you for years, Sam.

1539
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:14,480
You're the one spy I've never been

1540
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,750
able to provide as the one close to the Autobots.

1541
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:22,270
Sam, don't do what he wants.

1542
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:23,500
Yes he will.

1543
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:25,090
They all do.

1544
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,720
You should be smarter. You understand me.

1545
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:31,300
The time it takes you to blink,

1546
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:33,140
they will do it to her, and they will do it to me.

1547
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:35,130
So you show a little respect.

1548
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:37,180
When someone offers you a job.

1549
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:39,810
Wrist.

1550
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,510
You are to track down, Optimus Prime.

1551
01:20:42,510 --> 01:20:44,230
Because you're the one human he trusts.

1552
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:45,870
You will ask one question.

1553
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:47,550
How does he intend to fight back?

1554
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:49,860
Strategies, tactics, everything.

1555
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:57,100
Has a nasty little bite, doesn't it.

1556
01:20:57,380 --> 01:20:58,520
It's very high tech.

1557
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:59,040
It lets us see

1558
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,760
what you see, hear what you hear.

1559
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:02,290
And it attacks your nervous system.

1560
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:04,940
So if you so much as try and signal.

1561
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:08,600
I know what to tell you, Sam.

1562
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:10,140
Relationships have consequences.

1563
01:21:10,150 --> 01:21:11,630
I am here because my father,

1564
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:13,310
she is here because of you.

1565
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:18,380
Stop! Stop, stop...stop.

1566
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:20,160
Soundwave, if you please.

1567
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:25,120
Sam.

1568
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:26,530
Do your job.

1569
01:21:26,630 --> 01:21:28,710
She'll be safe. I give you my word.

1570
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:32,730
I'll kill you.

1571
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:34,410
You have my word.

1572
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:40,530
Combatant commands are now at Defcon 1.

1573
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,260
Approximately 200 Decepticons are in hiding.

1574
01:21:43,630 --> 01:21:44,890
Energon detectors have been

1575
01:21:44,890 --> 01:21:47,630
triggered as far away as South America and China.

1576
01:21:47,890 --> 01:21:50,440
The U.N. just received an encrypted audio file.

1577
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,630
They say it's from the leaders of the Autobots.

1578
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:55,080
Defenders of Earth.

1579
01:21:55,390 --> 01:21:57,950
We have come for your natural resources.

1580
01:21:57,950 --> 01:22:00,530
To rebuild our damaged planet.

1581
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:03,190
When we have transported all we needed.

1582
01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:05,530
We will leave your world in peace.

1583
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,050
For such peace to exist.

1584
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:13,210
You must immediately exile the Autobot rebels you have harbored.

1585
01:22:13,870 --> 01:22:15,550
Non negotiable.

1586
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:17,510
Renounce the rebels.

1587
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:20,090
We await your reply.

1588
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:22,780
We'll debrief you in transit.

1589
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:24,170
Yeah I really don't see how I can be of any help.

1590
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:25,220
I mean you guys seem pretty busy.

1591
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:27,260
We can just do this another time, I think.

1592
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:33,270
I have underestimated you at every turn.

1593
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:34,380
You..Ha...what?

1594
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:36,310
You warned us that they were using humans.

1595
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:38,200
And you knew that Sentinel was the key.

1596
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:39,130
Director.

1597
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:41,770
Oh, who am I? Hey, you're the expert.

1598
01:22:41,780 --> 01:22:43,560
I'm just a walking security risk.

1599
01:22:49,530 --> 01:22:50,520
Are you all right?

1600
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,620
Yes.

1601
01:22:53,730 --> 01:22:55,520
- No you're not, you're sweating. - No, I'm fine.

1602
01:22:55,550 --> 01:22:57,280
I'm fine. I'm sweating because I'm nervous.

1603
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,250
I'm nervous because you

1604
01:22:58,250 --> 01:22:59,680
got me in here for this information, okay.

1605
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:00,970
I'm a twitter junkie, I blog everything,

1606
01:23:00,970 --> 01:23:01,870
I can't keep secrets.

1607
01:23:01,870 --> 01:23:03,030
- Oh you wouldn't dare. - That's the truth, I'm telling you.

1608
01:23:03,030 --> 01:23:03,550
You wouldn't dare.

1609
01:23:03,550 --> 01:23:04,760
Director I got a call for you at 15.

1610
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:08,070
What are you doing?

1611
01:23:08,130 --> 01:23:09,350
Nothing, what are you doing?

1612
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:11,360
Get away from me.

1613
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:14,380
It's been a remarkable series of events today at the Capitol.

1614
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:16,260
Just moments ago legislation was

1615
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:19,510
passed to exile the Autobots from American shores.

1616
01:23:19,510 --> 01:23:23,050
The U.S. Military alliance with them is officially over.

1617
01:23:23,150 --> 01:23:24,590
- The words of the house and the... - Yeah.

1618
01:23:24,590 --> 01:23:26,630
..Authority leaders responds to today's resolution.

1619
01:23:26,630 --> 01:23:28,490
- What? - We cannot in good conscious invite...

1620
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,930
They can't do this, you gotta tell them they can't do that.

1621
01:23:30,930 --> 01:23:32,830
Okay, it's official, it's a go people!

1622
01:23:32,830 --> 01:23:33,620
These are our allies.

1623
01:23:33,620 --> 01:23:35,140
The Autobot's fought for us, they fought with us.

1624
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:36,080
And where are we now?

1625
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:37,550
Facing an enemy invasion.

1626
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:40,670
With an enemy that has the means to deploy countless more.

1627
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:45,580
If there's more you know?

1628
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:48,090
Anything at all about the enemies intentions.

1629
01:23:49,450 --> 01:23:50,820
Now's the time to tell.

1630
01:23:51,810 --> 01:23:53,960
Autobots have no way of leaving this planet.

1631
01:23:54,410 --> 01:23:55,850
That is where you're wrong.

1632
01:23:57,070 --> 01:23:59,150
Its name is the Xanthium.

1633
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,060
It bought the second wave of Autobots.

1634
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:03,650
And it's been under NASA's care and study ever since.

1635
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:06,140
We've linked it with a decommissioned shuttle,

1636
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:08,880
to maintain military control until they're gone.

1637
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:10,910
Gonna be 10,000 pounds of torque

1638
01:24:10,910 --> 01:24:13,320
on this cheaper Cheep... Oh, not my thing.

1639
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:15,730
You damage this delays all me mates.

1640
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:17,560
That's your wreckers.

1641
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:19,210
They take care of the Xanthium.

1642
01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:20,500
We don't let them off the base much,

1643
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:21,440
because they're assholes.

1644
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,500
You gotta pull that you Nancy wanker.

1645
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,400
It's torqued to kill them.

1646
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,330
Calm down.

1647
01:24:29,610 --> 01:24:32,410
- Epps. - You are ridiculous, that's you.

1648
01:24:32,410 --> 01:24:33,380
Hello, man.

1649
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:36,740
-What are you doing here -I'm retired from the air force.

1650
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:38,190
Can you let my hand go?

1651
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:41,160
What the hell was that?

1652
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:43,840
I went on to just consult and run interference for them.

1653
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:45,590
No more combat

1654
01:24:45,590 --> 01:24:47,030
or alien shooting at my ass.

1655
01:24:47,030 --> 01:24:48,280
I got a dream job.

1656
01:24:50,230 --> 01:24:51,700
Kicking the Autobots out.

1657
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:53,740
Do you believe this is happening?

1658
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:55,640
Where do you think is taking them?

1659
01:24:55,870 --> 01:24:57,150
Any planet but here.

1660
01:25:00,690 --> 01:25:02,760
I want to talk to whoever's in charge here.

1661
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:07,700
Charlotte Mearing.

1662
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:08,880
Agent Simmons

1663
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,830
Former Agent Simmons, so.

1664
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:12,660
I see you survived Washington.

1665
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:14,540
Washington, Egypt, heartbreak.

1666
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:17,100
I survived, I will survive.

1667
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,000
They're bringing everybody in, kid.

1668
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,050
Putting all the Intel on the table.

1669
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:24,240
And if you think that putting 9 Autobots,

1670
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:26,430
is going to solve a damn thing...

1671
01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:27,520
It's out of my hands.

1672
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:30,450
Moving up in the world, huh?

1673
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:33,880
Your booty looks excellent.

1674
01:25:37,730 --> 01:25:39,340
You ever say word to anyone

1675
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:41,030
about what happened that night in Quantico.

1676
01:25:41,430 --> 01:25:42,910
I'll cut your heart out.

1677
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:44,650
You already did.

1678
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:46,670
Sammy, listen to me.

1679
01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:48,770
Don't let them exile us.

1680
01:25:48,770 --> 01:25:50,060
Don't let them take us, Sam.

1681
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:51,690
It's a Decepticon trap.

1682
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:31,100
Checked the nitrogen, we're booting out of here.

1683
01:26:33,950 --> 01:26:34,930
Optimus.

1684
01:26:35,050 --> 01:26:37,250
What your leaders say is true.

1685
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:39,900
This was all my fault.

1686
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:42,210
I told them whom to trust.

1687
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:44,260
I was so wrong.

1688
01:26:44,550 --> 01:26:45,480
It doesn't make your fault,

1689
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:47,030
it makes you human for a change.

1690
01:26:47,450 --> 01:26:48,630
Remember this.

1691
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,840
You may loose your faith in us.

1692
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:55,270
But never in yourselves.

1693
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:04,210
I need to know how you're going to fight back.

1694
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:07,160
I know there's a strategy.

1695
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:09,590
I know you're coming back with reinforcements.

1696
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:11,020
Something, I know there's a plan.

1697
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:17,360
You can tell me, no other human will ever know.

1698
01:27:19,020 --> 01:27:20,480
There is no plan.

1699
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:23,320
We just do what they want,

1700
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:24,650
how are we going to live with ourselves?

1701
01:27:26,590 --> 01:27:28,590
You are my friend, Sam.

1702
01:27:29,710 --> 01:27:31,100
You always will be.

1703
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:34,040
But your leaders have spoken.

1704
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:36,770
From here.

1705
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:40,640
The fight will be your own.

1706
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:56,040
Make it short.

1707
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:57,790
We're loading up.

1708
01:27:58,590 --> 01:28:00,570
All right, hustle up!

1709
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:07,500
When we do whatever we can.

1710
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:09,400
make it like it was.

1711
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:11,900
You will always be, my friend.

1712
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:13,300
Sam.

1713
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:14,900
I gotta be going on.

1714
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:31,600
Years from now, they're gonna ask us.

1715
01:28:32,670 --> 01:28:35,340
Where were you when they took over the planet?

1716
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:38,740
We're gonna say.

1717
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:42,440
We just stood by and watched.

1718
01:28:56,340 --> 01:28:58,640
You should really look at this as a partnership.

1719
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:01,730
You have to stand on the side of progress

1720
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:03,040
if you want to be a part of history.

1721
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:21,640
Go launch in..5...4...3..2

1722
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:24,040
1...zero.

1723
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:52,960
The word is, you got it.

1724
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,830
I always get what I want, Sam.

1725
01:29:54,830 --> 01:29:57,240
We just needed to be sure.

1726
01:29:57,340 --> 01:29:58,440
Sure of what?

1727
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:00,140
That they would go without a fight.

1728
01:30:10,390 --> 01:30:13,640
- Say again? - Detecting a foreign object.

1729
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:07,170
We all work for the Decepticons now.

1730
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:11,310


1731
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:13,440
I need your help to track a phone call.

1732
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:15,340
It's a man on this phone, he's the head of the human operation.

1733
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:16,540
And he's holding Carly hostage.

1734
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:18,240
Sit down, don't move.

1735
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,970
I'm watching him drive up right now.

1736
01:31:28,130 --> 01:31:29,630
The call was placed in-route.

1737
01:31:29,630 --> 01:31:32,130
I'm hacking into the phone's camera right now.

1738
01:31:32,430 --> 01:31:34,630
There that is, that's a live stream from the camera.

1739
01:31:34,730 --> 01:31:36,900
Someplace, hold on I can triangulate this.

1740
01:31:38,390 --> 01:31:39,890
Okay, it's Chicago cell site.

1741
01:31:39,990 --> 01:31:41,090
There, I got it.

1742
01:31:41,090 --> 01:31:43,290
Trump tower, Chicago, lower penthouse.

1743
01:31:43,490 --> 01:31:44,490
We're on.

1744
01:31:46,790 --> 01:31:48,290
- I'm going. - You're sure.

1745
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:49,590
She is out there without any help

1746
01:31:49,590 --> 01:31:51,640
I can be there in 15 hours.

1747
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:53,350
You're not going alone.

1748
01:31:56,650 --> 01:31:58,690
Still got my NEST friends out there.

1749
01:31:58,690 --> 01:31:59,940
We'll round them up,

1750
01:31:59,940 --> 01:32:02,250
find your girlfriend and bring this guy in.

1751
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:03,550
Why are you helping me?

1752
01:32:04,650 --> 01:32:07,150
'Cause that asshole killed my friends, too.

1753
01:32:23,850 --> 01:32:25,650
They said they were here for our resources.

1754
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:27,050
To rebuild their planet.

1755
01:32:27,050 --> 01:32:29,650
Yes, really one resource in particular.

1756
01:32:30,050 --> 01:32:31,950
One unique to our planet.

1757
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:35,350
Us.

1758
01:32:37,650 --> 01:32:39,150
You're very smart.

1759
01:32:39,150 --> 01:32:41,750
You see they can't rebuild without a slave labor force.

1760
01:32:41,950 --> 01:32:44,850
How many rocks up there in the universe offer 6 billion workers?

1761
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:46,150
What are you talking about?

1762
01:32:46,150 --> 01:32:48,150
We can't transport people.

1763
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:50,360
They're not shipping people.

1764
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:51,780
They're shipping their planet here.

1765
01:32:57,850 --> 01:32:58,750
Oh, my God.

1766
01:32:59,650 --> 01:33:01,380
What's Sentinel doing here?

1767
01:33:01,380 --> 01:33:02,860
Watch.

1768
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:05,260
They're spreading hundreds of pillars around the globe right now.

1769
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:06,860
In just a few hours.

1770
01:33:07,060 --> 01:33:08,460
They're going to launch them into orbit.

1771
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:11,160
And bring cybertron into our atmosphere.

1772
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:14,060
The red one there, controls the rest.

1773
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:16,360
He triggers that, it starts the whole thing.

1774
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:20,360
Be gone insect operative, your work is done.

1775
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:21,710
Your Excellency.

1776
01:33:21,710 --> 01:33:22,860
You're such a dick.

1777
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:28,450
You want this to happen?

1778
01:33:28,450 --> 01:33:30,060
I want to survive. I want 40 more years.

1779
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:31,460
You think I asked for this?

1780
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:32,960
I inherited a client.

1781
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:35,460
Yeah, and when Cybertron's here and we're all their slaves

1782
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:37,660
I guess they'll still need a human leader.

1783
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,960
Get this straight, you want to survive you listen to me.

1784
01:33:56,860 --> 01:33:58,750
It is time for the slaves of earth

1785
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:00,860
to recognize their masters.

1786
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:03,660
Seal off the city.

1787
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:01,260
Get the dogs out of here now, get them in the back.

1788
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:04,860
I guess they didn't tell you about this part, did they.

1789
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,260
You think I'm at every meeting?

1790
01:35:06,860 --> 01:35:08,160
They promised I'm safe.

1791
01:35:09,860 --> 01:35:11,260
They said I'm safe.

1792
01:35:22,980 --> 01:35:24,260
Let's roll.

1793
01:35:30,660 --> 01:35:32,160
Don't have a signal reading.

1794
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:33,560
It's not working.

1795
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:06,060
Move back.

1796
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:20,120
There's a ring of alien ships around Chicago.

1797
01:36:20,220 --> 01:36:23,800
Our high range bombers were just knocked out of the sky.

1798
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:27,680
They can't get through enemy air defenses over the city.

1799
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:29,250
Our satellites have been jammed.

1800
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:31,550
We have no way to monitor the enemies movement.

1801
01:36:31,550 --> 01:36:33,110
All NEST teams are on stand down.

1802
01:36:33,110 --> 01:36:34,850
Only have troops at air force base, move out.

1803
01:36:34,850 --> 01:36:36,240
10 minutes from the battle zone.

1804
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:39,110
We have special forces trying to gain access to the city.

1805
01:36:39,110 --> 01:36:40,820
An infantry is staging at the perimeter.

1806
01:36:41,020 --> 01:36:43,220
Excuse me, excuse me, it just doesn't make sense.

1807
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:45,960
Can't we get any eyes in there at all?

1808
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:48,080
They keep shooting down our drones.

1809
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:49,480
They want us blind.

1810
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:52,380
But we do have a couple of mini-drones we're gonna try.

1811
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,880
Well if we can man these UAV drones,

1812
01:36:54,980 --> 01:36:56,980
...Can we try to redirect them toward, Trump Tower?

1813
01:36:57,080 --> 01:36:59,180
The kid, Witwicky was on his way to Chicago.

1814
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:01,980
Set some point man human ops there,

1815
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:04,080
before the Decepticons.

1816
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:05,580
Listen, if I know anything, I know this.

1817
01:37:05,580 --> 01:37:09,580
That kid is an alien bad news magnet.

1818
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:51,580
My God.

1819
01:37:52,180 --> 01:37:55,280
We came here to find her in the middle of all that?

1820
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:57,030
Are we really going out there, Epps?

1821
01:37:57,680 --> 01:37:59,080
I'm not going in there.

1822
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:01,580
No one's going in.

1823
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:09,280
I am.

1824
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:12,680
With or without you, I'll find her.

1825
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:15,480
You're gonna get yourself killed, Sam.

1826
01:38:15,580 --> 01:38:16,680
Is that what you want?

1827
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:18,080
Is that what you want?

1828
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:20,960
You came all the way out here to get yourself killed.

1829
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:22,860
Huh? Listen...to me what I'm saying.

1830
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:24,460
She's here because of me, do you understand?

1831
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:26,560
Listen, if you go in this building.

1832
01:38:26,660 --> 01:38:28,360
That's if she's even still alive.

1833
01:38:28,460 --> 01:38:30,190
There's no way you're going to be able to even reach her.

1834
01:38:30,190 --> 01:38:31,370
Well what would you suggest I do.

1835
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:33,860
It's over.

1836
01:38:36,110 --> 01:38:37,980
I'm sorry, but it's over.

1837
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:39,780
No.

1838
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,940
Woah, incoming!

1839
01:39:29,250 --> 01:39:31,050
We will kill them all.

1840
01:39:35,890 --> 01:39:37,590
Wreckers, kill him.

1841
01:39:40,090 --> 01:39:43,490
This is going to hurt a lot.

1842
01:39:49,390 --> 01:39:51,990
Your leaders will now understand.

1843
01:39:52,190 --> 01:39:55,590
Decepticons will never leave your planet alone.

1844
01:39:55,890 --> 01:39:59,290
And we needed them to believe we had gone.

1845
01:39:59,290 --> 01:40:02,610
For today, in the name of freedom,

1846
01:40:03,170 --> 01:40:06,070
we take the battle to them.

1847
01:40:27,910 --> 01:40:29,570
I saw your ship blow up.

1848
01:40:29,570 --> 01:40:32,470
The ship, we were never in the ship.

1849
01:40:32,470 --> 01:40:35,030
We designed the damn thing, didn't we.

1850
01:40:35,030 --> 01:40:38,270
We were hidden in the first booster rocket to separate,

1851
01:40:38,270 --> 01:40:41,420
splashed down back in the Atlantic, just as planned.

1852
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:43,880
We ain't going no where.

1853
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:46,080
Yeah, no ones exiling us.

1854
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:50,580
The Autobots are just staying right here.

1855
01:40:50,780 --> 01:40:52,750
We're going to help you win this war.

1856
01:40:52,750 --> 01:40:55,740
They're surrounding the city to make a fortress.

1857
01:40:56,280 --> 01:40:58,980
So that no one can see what they're up to inside.

1858
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:02,860
Our only chance is the element of surprise.

1859
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:04,640
I think I know where to look.

1860
01:41:06,710 --> 01:41:08,710
Mini-drones on approach, Trump Tower.

1861
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:15,300
You're telling me, Sam's headed into that?

1862
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:17,460
Poor kid.

1863
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:20,400
Probably never got close.

1864
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:22,490
Your gonna fly this thing, right?

1865
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:25,660
What does, what is that, what is that?

1866
01:41:25,660 --> 01:41:26,740
So, so.

1867
01:41:27,380 --> 01:41:28,390
So you so, so can fly.

1868
01:41:28,390 --> 01:41:29,590
That feels terrible.

1869
01:41:31,830 --> 01:41:33,340
We're right behind you.

1870
01:41:40,130 --> 01:41:40,750
All right.

1871
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:41,990
We're going in.

1872
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:08,700
The city's secure.

1873
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:12,330
The humans cannot stop us.

1874
01:42:12,330 --> 01:42:14,230
As the afternoon falls,

1875
01:42:14,430 --> 01:42:18,100
the rest of the pillars will reach their launch position.

1876
01:42:18,100 --> 01:42:23,470
This is the victory I promised you so many years ago

1877
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:26,940
where we rebuild Cybertron.

1878
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:28,410
together.

1879
01:42:28,410 --> 01:42:34,610
I have gained to work with you that my planet may survive.

1880
01:42:34,610 --> 01:42:37,790
I will never work for you.

1881
01:42:38,710 --> 01:42:42,430
And you would be wise to remember the difference.

1882
01:43:03,150 --> 01:43:05,650
Oh, I'm so sick of this. I'm sick of waiting.

1883
01:43:09,550 --> 01:43:11,010
Where is she?

1884
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:12,640
Where is she!?

1885
01:43:13,750 --> 01:43:15,150
You've got some balls.

1886
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:29,260
No, Sam!

1887
01:43:30,790 --> 01:43:34,550
No!

1888
01:43:38,530 --> 01:43:40,050
Carly!

1889
01:43:41,250 --> 01:43:42,650
Carly!

1890
01:43:45,050 --> 01:43:46,750
Jump.

1891
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:21,650
Bee, fire.

1892
01:44:22,630 --> 01:44:24,350
Help him, Bee.

1893
01:44:47,550 --> 01:44:49,750
Autobots, they're alive.

1894
01:44:49,850 --> 01:44:52,140
They're here, Autobots.

1895
01:44:52,140 --> 01:44:53,800
Decepticons defend the pillar.

1896
01:44:55,120 --> 01:44:57,040
Release the bridges.

1897
01:44:57,920 --> 01:44:59,410
Find them.

1898
01:45:14,850 --> 01:45:15,750
Sam.

1899
01:45:17,850 --> 01:45:18,850
You found me.

1900
01:45:18,950 --> 01:45:20,150
I'd find you anywhere.

1901
01:45:33,850 --> 01:45:35,260
... let's go, let's go.

1902
01:45:35,350 --> 01:45:36,550
Well you're crazy.

1903
01:45:37,750 --> 01:45:39,540
What is that, is that us?

1904
01:45:40,670 --> 01:45:42,800
This thing is a military UAV drone.

1905
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:44,250
Check to see if it's still working.

1906
01:45:44,250 --> 01:45:45,370
Yeah, it's still got power.

1907
01:45:45,370 --> 01:45:47,150
Flight control, do you copy?

1908
01:45:47,150 --> 01:45:48,590
Can you rotate?

1909
01:45:48,590 --> 01:45:49,980
Can you do something?

1910
01:45:49,980 --> 01:45:51,160
I think we got something.

1911
01:45:51,160 --> 01:45:52,460
Epps, we got Epps.

1912
01:45:52,460 --> 01:45:53,960
...do something.

1913
01:45:54,060 --> 01:45:55,860
Come man, work, work.

1914
01:45:55,860 --> 01:45:57,560
All right, turn the volume up on that.

1915
01:45:57,660 --> 01:45:58,760
It's him.

1916
01:45:58,860 --> 01:46:00,560
Can you rotate, something.

1917
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:03,160
Yes, yes.

1918
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:04,560
Okay, okay they can see us.

1919
01:46:04,660 --> 01:46:06,460
Chicago is ground zero, you understand?

1920
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:08,560
- You hear us, understand? - Jesus.

1921
01:46:09,260 --> 01:46:10,430
The Sentinel prime is here

1922
01:46:10,430 --> 01:46:12,360
and he has components for his space bridge.

1923
01:46:12,460 --> 01:46:14,060
They're on top of a building on the Chicago river.

1924
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:15,460
So they have whole bunch school doing investment

1925
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:17,160
The control pillar controls everything.

1926
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:18,560
In the southeast cupola.

1927
01:46:18,660 --> 01:46:20,660
You gotta shoot the pillar. You have to shoot down the pillar.

1928
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:22,400
Or they're going to transport Cybertron here,

1929
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:23,590
do you understand?

1930
01:46:23,590 --> 01:46:24,560
What?

1931
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:27,060
Give me the GPS on that building and on that drone.

1932
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:28,160
Let's go.

1933
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:29,860
Knights read those co-ordinates.

1934
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:30,960
Show the kill chain.

1935
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:32,560
Guys on the tarmac, five minutes.

1936
01:46:32,660 --> 01:46:34,160
- South east cupalar. - All right.

1937
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:38,510
We need to move before the fighters spot us.

1938
01:46:38,510 --> 01:46:40,810
Wait here until we scout a route ahead.

1939
01:46:41,010 --> 01:46:42,010
Let's roll.

1940
01:46:42,110 --> 01:46:43,350
Ratchet, cover high.

1941
01:46:44,310 --> 01:46:46,710
Hey, think you could use that rocket to shoot down the pillar?

1942
01:46:46,750 --> 01:46:48,050
We're eight blocks away.

1943
01:46:48,250 --> 01:46:49,750
We gotta get closer to take a shot.

1944
01:46:49,750 --> 01:46:51,350
Not closer, higher.

1945
01:46:51,550 --> 01:46:52,950
We need clear line of sight.

1946
01:46:53,050 --> 01:46:54,150
And it's across the river.

1947
01:46:54,150 --> 01:46:56,050
Gonna have a hell of a time trying to sneaking up.

1948
01:46:56,250 --> 01:46:57,550
We only got one shot.

1949
01:46:58,750 --> 01:47:00,150
One shot's all we need.

1950
01:47:00,950 --> 01:47:03,630
We gotta be able to see around that building from the ground.

1951
01:47:03,630 --> 01:47:06,650
Get NSA to send service specs for any cameras in that area.

1952
01:47:06,750 --> 01:47:07,850
Maybe some are working.

1953
01:47:07,950 --> 01:47:10,650
Traffic lights, ATM's anything.

1954
01:47:11,660 --> 01:47:12,660
Listen up.

1955
01:47:12,860 --> 01:47:14,610
You want to get back?

1956
01:47:14,610 --> 01:47:16,360
We're going to have a wing-suit in.

1957
01:47:16,660 --> 01:47:17,960
It's the only way to get close.

1958
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:21,080
I can't promise anyone a ride home,

1959
01:47:21,080 --> 01:47:22,060
but if you're with me...

1960
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:24,360
The world needs you now.

1961
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:27,360
I'll find my own ride home, sir.

1962
01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:31,260
Who else?

1963
01:47:31,260 --> 01:47:32,360
Right here, sir.

1964
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:36,220
General warn tower we're

1965
01:47:36,220 --> 01:47:38,770
taking diversionary action to south of the city.

1966
01:47:38,770 --> 01:47:39,860
We're coming from north and low.

1967
01:47:39,860 --> 01:47:41,860
You guys drop in south east

1968
01:47:57,930 --> 01:48:00,030
Autobot victory, Autobot victory.

1969
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:35,280
Gotta warn you. It's scary out there, Decepticons.

1970
01:48:35,480 --> 01:48:39,130
They got my trailer, I need that flight tech.

1971
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:42,680
Shockwave can't hunt all of us at once.

1972
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:46,280
Wreckers, we need a diversion.

1973
01:48:46,580 --> 01:48:49,340
- Let's get some. - You got that right.

1974
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:52,380
Listen, we're going to circle around to that glass building.

1975
01:48:52,580 --> 01:48:54,680
We'll get high enough to make the rocket shot.

1976
01:48:54,780 --> 01:48:56,980
While you guys draw his fire, let's move.

1977
01:48:57,180 --> 01:48:58,180
Wait a minute.

1978
01:48:58,180 --> 01:48:59,890
I'm not going letting you go out there

1979
01:48:59,890 --> 01:49:01,470
without my urban-combat prototypes.

1980
01:49:01,470 --> 01:49:03,180
We gotta go, Que. Come on.

1981
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:05,180
Wait, they're great inventions for kicking ass.

1982
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:06,280
What are these?

1983
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:07,680
Those are boom sticks.

1984
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:10,240
Armed in thirty seconds.

1985
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:12,070
Grapple gloves, for climbing.

1986
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:15,080
- Move out, go on. - Move!

1987
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:16,480
Go, go, go.

1988
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:24,530
Move, move! Let's go.

1989
01:49:36,380 --> 01:49:37,780
Let's go, come on.

1990
01:49:45,170 --> 01:49:46,170
Hey, where you going?

1991
01:49:46,170 --> 01:49:48,670
- No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop. - Where you going?

1992
01:49:48,670 --> 01:49:50,970
- Don't leave. - Never leave a bro behind.

1993
01:49:51,070 --> 01:49:53,150
Aw, Shockwaves coming.

1994
01:49:57,570 --> 01:49:58,570
Go for the stairs.

1995
01:49:58,770 --> 01:50:00,070
Epps, this way.

1996
01:50:01,570 --> 01:50:03,170
Breaking right, breaking right.

1997
01:50:03,470 --> 01:50:04,570
Read, rolling left.

1998
01:50:10,170 --> 01:50:11,970
We got another one coming around. Coming on the left side.

1999
01:50:12,070 --> 01:50:13,370
Going around on to the right side. Going around.

2000
01:50:13,470 --> 01:50:15,670
We're going to use Willis Tower for cover.

2001
01:50:15,770 --> 01:50:17,270
Once we make altitude.

2002
01:50:17,270 --> 01:50:18,170
We jump.

2003
01:50:18,470 --> 01:50:21,270
Hot air. Attack on one now.

2004
01:50:22,970 --> 01:50:25,170
- Man I don't think he's going to make it. - Mayday, mayday.

2005
01:50:25,370 --> 01:50:26,670
Chopper one going down.

2006
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:33,830
Come on, come on, come on.

2007
01:50:44,170 --> 01:50:46,770
Got them on target, twenty seconds.

2008
01:50:47,470 --> 01:50:49,650
Well here we go, here we go.

2009
01:50:49,650 --> 01:50:51,120
Keep it tight.

2010
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:52,580
coming around.

2011
01:50:52,580 --> 01:50:54,760
All right, focus focus focus

2012
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:01,500
Six o'clock.

2013
01:51:06,860 --> 01:51:07,960
Watch out, watch out!

2014
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:09,760
Oh, shit.

2015
01:51:13,310 --> 01:51:14,810
Get them out, get them out, get them out.

2016
01:51:14,910 --> 01:51:17,010
Now, out, out! Jump, jump, jump.

2017
01:51:23,270 --> 01:51:24,470
Get out, get out.

2018
01:51:25,770 --> 01:51:26,970
Let's fly, let's move.

2019
01:51:26,970 --> 01:51:29,070
get them all down, get them all down.

2020
01:51:29,270 --> 01:51:30,770
Help!

2021
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:52,960
Get separation, track away, track away.

2022
01:52:12,860 --> 01:52:14,960
More flap, more flap.

2023
01:52:33,230 --> 01:52:34,860
Check your six, Check your six.

2024
01:52:34,860 --> 01:52:36,340
He's on our ass.

2025
01:52:43,010 --> 01:52:44,020
Separate.

2026
01:52:49,450 --> 01:52:50,610
Building, dead ahead.

2027
01:52:50,610 --> 01:52:51,830
Thread the needle.

2028
01:53:01,710 --> 01:53:02,860
Pull, pull!

2029
01:53:06,420 --> 01:53:07,290
Hey come on we'll line up.

2030
01:53:07,290 --> 01:53:08,370
This is a mother getting up here.

2031
01:53:08,370 --> 01:53:09,760
Get your fat ass over here.

2032
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:10,510
I'm coming.

2033
01:53:16,110 --> 01:53:17,340
Set up the rocket.

2034
01:53:18,940 --> 01:53:19,760
Come on.

2035
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:20,890
We're up and status.

2036
01:53:21,190 --> 01:53:22,180
Bring on bomb busters.

2037
01:53:22,180 --> 01:53:23,380
20 persons D spot.

2038
01:53:25,220 --> 01:53:27,250
There, the building with the Prime.

2039
01:53:28,790 --> 01:53:29,840
For our brothers.

2040
01:53:31,020 --> 01:53:32,610
Let's make this trip worth it.

2041
01:53:35,560 --> 01:53:36,330
Oh, oh God.

2042
01:53:37,850 --> 01:53:40,220
Whoa, this building oh the building.

2043
01:53:45,140 --> 01:53:46,300
They're shooting at the building.

2044
01:53:49,850 --> 01:53:51,140
This is not a good idea.

2045
01:53:51,140 --> 01:53:51,820
What?

2046
01:53:51,820 --> 01:53:53,750
This is not a good idea, the building's not stable.

2047
01:53:53,750 --> 01:53:55,590
Just stop for a second. We don't do what we can do.

2048
01:53:55,590 --> 01:53:56,700
Then it doesn't matter, we all die.

2049
01:53:56,710 --> 01:53:58,210
Right? It's your time, come on man.

2050
01:53:58,710 --> 01:54:00,270
I'm incapable of collapse.

2051
01:54:00,690 --> 01:54:01,960
I'm having a heart attack anyway.

2052
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:05,090
The building is going over.

2053
01:54:05,310 --> 01:54:06,510
-Hang on. -Take cover.

2054
01:54:25,010 --> 01:54:26,090
It's okay, it's done.

2055
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:27,780
Guys, look.

2056
01:54:28,210 --> 01:54:29,040
Incoming, incoming.

2057
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:30,160
Everybody hide.

2058
01:54:58,610 --> 01:54:59,530
Don't...

2059
01:54:59,530 --> 01:55:00,680
move.

2060
01:55:15,700 --> 01:55:16,810
Cover fire.

2061
01:55:19,610 --> 01:55:22,540
Shoot the glass, jump out the window.

2062
01:55:29,600 --> 01:55:30,700
Jump.

2063
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:53,380
Sam, I can't stop.

2064
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:54,590
Shoot the glass.

2065
01:56:21,430 --> 01:56:22,390
Sam.

2066
01:56:47,740 --> 01:56:49,000
Is everyone okay?

2067
01:56:50,370 --> 01:56:51,100
You okay?

2068
01:56:51,370 --> 01:56:52,890
What the hell was that?

2069
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:00,840
This Zevo thing is looking at me.

2070
01:57:00,970 --> 01:57:01,610
What?

2071
01:57:14,350 --> 01:57:16,530
He's even got a undulating decepticon with it.

2072
01:57:16,810 --> 01:57:17,760
Get back.

2073
01:57:36,470 --> 01:57:38,900
It's coming up, the stairs are blocked.

2074
01:57:40,770 --> 01:57:41,800
Hey, how do we get out of here.

2075
01:57:41,800 --> 01:57:42,970
Hey, come on.

2076
01:57:42,970 --> 01:57:45,760
Oh lord, just let me get out of this alive.

2077
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:47,740
I'll give you annuities, and get it together.

2078
01:57:56,060 --> 01:57:57,890
Move, we gotta move.

2079
01:57:57,890 --> 01:57:59,950
Why do the Decepticons always get the good shit.

2080
01:57:59,950 --> 01:58:00,540
Move.

2081
01:58:00,540 --> 01:58:01,850
We got leave people.

2082
01:58:43,070 --> 01:58:44,110
Give me your hand.

2083
01:58:44,110 --> 01:58:46,120
You know, got her.

2084
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:49,270
Let's drop her to the fire escape.

2085
01:59:07,530 --> 01:59:08,820
Sam!

2086
01:59:08,820 --> 01:59:10,900
Whoa, we gotta move.

2087
01:59:20,820 --> 01:59:21,960
Get down, move.

2088
01:59:24,950 --> 01:59:26,680
I'm coming for you.

2089
02:00:22,910 --> 02:00:23,920
Optimus!

2090
02:00:24,410 --> 02:00:25,270
Wreckers.

2091
02:00:25,720 --> 02:00:26,600
We're coming.

2092
02:00:27,930 --> 02:00:29,830
Decepticons around the world.

2093
02:00:30,710 --> 02:00:32,160
Launch the pillars.

2094
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:05,750
Ahh, we are so lost.

2095
02:01:06,180 --> 02:01:07,390
Always left out.

2096
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:09,860
Excellent.

2097
02:01:12,510 --> 02:01:14,240
It's time to lay down the law.

2098
02:01:14,310 --> 02:01:15,770
By to be the hurt now.

2099
02:01:24,060 --> 02:01:24,970
They're starting.

2100
02:01:25,610 --> 02:01:26,500
You see it.

2101
02:01:29,630 --> 02:01:30,500
Get down.

2102
02:01:39,380 --> 02:01:40,590
Where is Sam and Carly?

2103
02:01:43,010 --> 02:01:44,330
We can run this way.

2104
02:01:52,030 --> 02:01:53,230
I give you one thing to do.

2105
02:01:53,500 --> 02:01:55,600
One thing to do and you drop the ball on that.

2106
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:57,010
I never signed for all of this.

2107
02:01:57,190 --> 02:01:59,430
Got aliens blasting me, running around chasing me.

2108
02:01:59,440 --> 02:02:00,280
I'm ducking in churches and

2109
02:02:00,280 --> 02:02:01,890
buildings and all that kind of crap, maybe.

2110
02:02:01,890 --> 02:02:03,510
This is bullshit, I didn't sign up for this, Epps.

2111
02:02:04,870 --> 02:02:06,030
I'm trying to keep it down.

2112
02:02:10,470 --> 02:02:13,440
What a treat, you and me.  Alone.

2113
02:02:19,480 --> 02:02:20,660
Come on, come on. Let's run.

2114
02:02:24,460 --> 02:02:25,540
Okay, he's after me not you.

2115
02:02:25,890 --> 02:02:27,170
Wait run, run.

2116
02:02:29,540 --> 02:02:31,080
You can't hide, boy.

2117
02:02:34,300 --> 02:02:35,000
Run, move it.

2118
02:02:35,050 --> 02:02:37,590
Love it when your little insect feet,

2119
02:02:37,590 --> 02:02:39,310
...try to run!

2120
02:02:44,360 --> 02:02:45,060
You!

2121
02:02:45,900 --> 02:02:48,340
Thought you were working for us, boy.

2122
02:02:52,810 --> 02:02:54,430
Sam!

2123
02:03:04,240 --> 02:03:04,940
My eye.

2124
02:03:18,330 --> 02:03:19,160
My eye!

2125
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:23,820
Target, Decepticon.

2126
02:03:31,940 --> 02:03:33,130
Sam!

2127
02:03:38,140 --> 02:03:39,670
Lennox you've got to save, Sam.

2128
02:03:39,670 --> 02:03:40,980
- You've got to save him. - What is he doing?

2129
02:03:44,540 --> 02:03:45,710
This better work.

2130
02:03:59,640 --> 02:04:03,270
Ow, ow, ow. I can't see, I can't see.

2131
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:04,630
Sam,

2132
02:04:04,930 --> 02:04:05,720
take my hand.

2133
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:07,440
Cut the line, cut the line. Not that much.

2134
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:09,520
- I'm trying. - The line.

2135
02:04:12,750 --> 02:04:14,740
You humans.

2136
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:16,010
20 seconds for that bomb.

2137
02:04:16,010 --> 02:04:16,690
What bomb?

2138
02:04:16,690 --> 02:04:17,530
See that boom.

2139
02:04:19,120 --> 02:04:20,150
I got it.

2140
02:04:20,640 --> 02:04:21,670
Well hold onto to me now.

2141
02:04:22,840 --> 02:04:24,580
I'll kick you.

2142
02:04:56,210 --> 02:04:57,120
Well he's dead.

2143
02:05:00,340 --> 02:05:02,150
Okay, he's going to run with

2144
02:05:02,150 --> 02:05:03,510
the rest of the Autobots, meet us at the river.

2145
02:05:03,510 --> 02:05:04,210
All right.

2146
02:05:32,940 --> 02:05:34,820
He sucked me in, there was nothing I could do.

2147
02:05:36,040 --> 02:05:39,170
Uh oh. This is a total cluster form.

2148
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:40,790
We gotta get across the river.

2149
02:05:42,240 --> 02:05:42,940
You see that?

2150
02:05:43,100 --> 02:05:44,860
She said the control pillar is in that first cupola.

2151
02:05:45,930 --> 02:05:47,550
Go, move. Let's move.

2152
02:05:48,910 --> 02:05:50,100
Tomahawks are inbound.

2153
02:05:52,440 --> 02:05:53,620
ETA, twenty minutes.

2154
02:05:53,790 --> 02:05:55,090
I'm in the traffic cameras.

2155
02:05:56,250 --> 02:05:57,460
Four Aubobots are captured.

2156
02:05:58,940 --> 02:06:00,220
Oh my God, we're helpless.

2157
02:06:00,570 --> 02:06:02,120
It was set to happen. With those

2158
02:06:02,180 --> 02:06:04,250
pulses getting faster it was going to happen soon.

2159
02:06:05,740 --> 02:06:07,040
No sign of Optimus.

2160
02:06:07,820 --> 02:06:09,090
How do we get these bridges down?

2161
02:06:11,090 --> 02:06:12,300
Spread out, check in there.

2162
02:06:16,140 --> 02:06:18,260
Epps, you're here, what are you doing?

2163
02:06:18,300 --> 02:06:19,270
Time is wack.

2164
02:06:19,700 --> 02:06:20,860
Even worse,

2165
02:06:20,860 --> 02:06:22,800
we can't get across the river to that dude.

2166
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:24,720
And the Aubobots are upstairs surrounded.

2167
02:06:31,020 --> 02:06:32,560
Just pan the camera around, all right.

2168
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:34,320
All right pan, pan right, that's you.

2169
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,900
Trying to get to that bridge control.

2170
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:41,650
What are they doing there? They are just standing there.

2171
02:06:41,650 --> 02:06:42,940
Hang on, Dutch.

2172
02:06:43,300 --> 02:06:45,100
See if you can hack into the bridge.

2173
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:47,920
Sir, the seals are here.

2174
02:06:48,370 --> 02:06:50,600
Oh it's a good day boys, what do you got?

2175
02:06:50,600 --> 02:06:52,030
Got ten manned navy seal element sir,

2176
02:06:52,030 --> 02:06:53,010
and just charging in Tomahawks.

2177
02:06:53,010 --> 02:06:54,180
- How long? - Fifteen.

2178
02:06:55,560 --> 02:06:56,520
Take it easy.

2179
02:06:58,170 --> 02:06:59,430
Get off me.

2180
02:07:02,910 --> 02:07:03,610
All right, you're gonna need your

2181
02:07:03,610 --> 02:07:05,010
40 mike-mikes in your frags.

2182
02:07:05,010 --> 02:07:05,760
Go for auto,

2183
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:07,430
the vibrations jack up their circuits.

2184
02:07:07,430 --> 02:07:09,220
Snipers, shoot for the eyes.

2185
02:07:09,370 --> 02:07:11,390
All right your target is up on top of that building.

2186
02:07:11,390 --> 02:07:12,150
That cupola.

2187
02:07:12,610 --> 02:07:15,260
How doomed you are, Autobots.

2188
02:07:15,480 --> 02:07:17,400
You simply fail to understand.

2189
02:07:17,890 --> 02:07:19,730
That the needs of the many,

2190
02:07:19,890 --> 02:07:21,780
out weigh the needs of the few.

2191
02:07:22,530 --> 02:07:24,210
Activating the bridge.

2192
02:07:36,790 --> 02:07:38,030
They have to guard something.

2193
02:07:38,830 --> 02:07:40,460
We're in the heart of their ship.

2194
02:07:40,830 --> 02:07:42,230
Let's give him a little ride.

2195
02:07:42,930 --> 02:07:44,810
Ho, ho we going to screw this ship up.

2196
02:07:45,530 --> 02:07:48,020
It's 128K binary inscription code.

2197
02:07:49,530 --> 02:07:50,290
It's difficult.

2198
02:07:51,550 --> 02:07:52,760
But not for me, I'm in.

2199
02:07:53,130 --> 02:07:54,670
Bridge, down.

2200
02:07:55,930 --> 02:07:57,370
The bridge is coming down.

2201
02:07:57,430 --> 02:07:58,780
Someone's watching over us.

2202
02:08:00,730 --> 02:08:02,460
Pleasure working with you, Seymour.

2203
02:08:03,430 --> 02:08:04,770
I believe you're suppose to say.

2204
02:08:05,630 --> 02:08:06,960
Good job, Dutch.

2205
02:08:07,430 --> 02:08:08,600
Danke schoen.

2206
02:08:40,530 --> 02:08:43,200
Prime, they're triggering the pillars.

2207
02:08:44,330 --> 02:08:47,010
Prisoners, you're keeping prisoners?

2208
02:08:47,060 --> 02:08:48,950
Yeeesss.

2209
02:08:49,130 --> 02:08:50,900
You need to teach them about respect.

2210
02:08:51,250 --> 02:08:52,130
This was all business,

2211
02:08:52,130 --> 02:08:53,610
but now it's personal. Do you understand me?

2212
02:08:55,130 --> 02:08:56,680
I understand.

2213
02:08:56,930 --> 02:08:58,250
No prisoners.

2214
02:08:58,250 --> 02:09:00,240
Only trophies.

2215
02:09:00,630 --> 02:09:04,270
B, I think they're going to kill us.

2216
02:09:05,430 --> 02:09:06,420
You.

2217
02:09:06,430 --> 02:09:08,110
You're time is up.

2218
02:09:08,110 --> 02:09:08,850
Wait, wait, wait.

2219
02:09:08,890 --> 02:09:09,930
We surrender.

2220
02:09:10,100 --> 02:09:11,220
We give...

2221
02:09:11,220 --> 02:09:12,200
Move it.

2222
02:09:12,200 --> 02:09:13,260
Can't we talk this out?

2223
02:09:13,430 --> 02:09:15,290
We're all a bunch of good chaps.

2224
02:09:15,630 --> 02:09:17,140
I mean in all...unh!!!

2225
02:09:19,830 --> 02:09:20,630
Why did you....

2226
02:09:29,030 --> 02:09:30,550
Goodbye my old friend.

2227
02:09:32,230 --> 02:09:33,950
You're mine now.

2228
02:09:49,490 --> 02:09:50,490
Gotta help him.

2229
02:09:50,660 --> 02:09:51,350
What?

2230
02:09:51,730 --> 02:09:52,730
What are you doing?

2231
02:09:53,230 --> 02:09:54,240
I gotta help him.

2232
02:09:54,630 --> 02:09:55,550
You can't help him.

2233
02:09:56,120 --> 02:09:56,780
Sam.

2234
02:10:03,930 --> 02:10:05,240
Turn around.

2235
02:10:15,130 --> 02:10:16,790
We, we never had it around.

2236
02:10:33,380 --> 02:10:35,090
We did it Brains. We did it.

2237
02:10:35,090 --> 02:10:36,860
Rip this ship apart.

2238
02:11:15,520 --> 02:11:17,300
- We...we had a nice run Brains, you and me. - Yeah.

2239
02:11:17,300 --> 02:11:18,160
We're gonna die.

2240
02:11:35,630 --> 02:11:37,600
Okay baby, you are coming with us.

2241
02:11:38,180 --> 02:11:39,200
Let's go, you guys

2242
02:11:39,200 --> 02:11:40,790
follow that ground team, go.

2243
02:11:41,130 --> 02:11:42,110
Move, move, move.

2244
02:11:42,230 --> 02:11:43,960
Third floor, load up a 45.

2245
02:11:49,930 --> 02:11:51,640
All right you two snipers right here.

2246
02:11:53,490 --> 02:11:54,380
All right, dock up.

2247
02:11:56,030 --> 02:11:57,250
Its up to twenty minutes.

2248
02:12:01,260 --> 02:12:02,480
Set the shot right here.

2249
02:12:07,670 --> 02:12:08,390
All right, set up.

2250
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:11,890
Downstairs.

2251
02:12:12,730 --> 02:12:14,740
We got five targets and Shockwave right below us.

2252
02:12:14,890 --> 02:12:16,050
Everybody jump.

2253
02:12:16,860 --> 02:12:18,510
All right, let's go. Get ready, get ready.

2254
02:12:32,130 --> 02:12:33,370
Go, go.

2255
02:12:43,990 --> 02:12:45,690
Snipers, take out their eyes.

2256
02:12:49,410 --> 02:12:51,400
All right, Demo team lets crank steel.

2257
02:12:59,170 --> 02:13:00,670
Turning steel.

2258
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:38,870
Don't fire until I tell you.

2259
02:13:49,650 --> 02:13:50,250
Go!

2260
02:13:52,850 --> 02:13:54,050
All right, good job.

2261
02:13:54,750 --> 02:13:55,960
- Yes. - Fire!

2262
02:14:07,760 --> 02:14:08,660
We got him.

2263
02:14:08,660 --> 02:14:09,720
Yeah.

2264
02:14:10,710 --> 02:14:11,530
On the run.

2265
02:14:14,700 --> 02:14:16,000
Autobots, attack.

2266
02:14:21,890 --> 02:14:23,040
Mortar that bridge.

2267
02:14:27,490 --> 02:14:29,790
It's our world, now.

2268
02:14:30,690 --> 02:14:32,350
Commence transport.

2269
02:14:45,200 --> 02:14:45,980
My God.

2270
02:15:02,150 --> 02:15:03,520
Optimus!

2271
02:15:38,570 --> 02:15:40,110
You die.

2272
02:15:48,420 --> 02:15:49,620
Nooo.

2273
02:16:00,230 --> 02:16:02,290
Get down here, Sentinel.

2274
02:16:02,460 --> 02:16:03,480
Optimus.

2275
02:16:04,770 --> 02:16:06,640
You forget your place.

2276
02:16:13,470 --> 02:16:15,660
I bring you Cybertron.

2277
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:17,280
Your home.

2278
02:16:18,120 --> 02:16:20,540
And still you choose humanity.

2279
02:16:21,290 --> 02:16:24,630
You were the one who taught me freedom is everyone's right.

2280
02:16:28,710 --> 02:16:30,930
I will retrigger that pillar.

2281
02:16:30,930 --> 02:16:33,210
Then you'll have to go through me.

2282
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:39,600
Okay, I got to help.

2283
02:16:39,750 --> 02:16:41,450
- No, you don't. - Listen to me now.

2284
02:16:41,640 --> 02:16:42,750
You're gonna be fine.

2285
02:16:42,900 --> 02:16:44,660
- You promised. - You're going to be fine.

2286
02:16:44,660 --> 02:16:45,520
I gotta get to that pillar.

2287
02:16:47,230 --> 02:16:48,600
Guards to the pillar.

2288
02:16:49,230 --> 02:16:50,740
We got Autobots.

2289
02:17:03,520 --> 02:17:04,570
Move, move!

2290
02:17:07,690 --> 02:17:09,600
Reinforcements to me.

2291
02:17:09,970 --> 02:17:12,540
Decepticon six, fire at Optimus.

2292
02:17:17,600 --> 02:17:20,240
Fire, I need those tomahawks here now.

2293
02:17:20,240 --> 02:17:21,210
First wave, incoming.

2294
02:17:28,140 --> 02:17:29,760
We gotta cover for, Optimus.

2295
02:17:44,760 --> 02:17:46,280
Decepticons,

2296
02:17:46,280 --> 02:17:47,640
trigger the pillar.

2297
02:17:48,430 --> 02:17:50,420
Restart that pillar.

2298
02:17:51,250 --> 02:17:52,510
Trigger the pillars.

2299
02:17:53,310 --> 02:17:55,100
I can't hold him.

2300
02:17:55,210 --> 02:17:57,580
This step I must bend.

2301
02:17:58,440 --> 02:17:59,980
No.

2302
02:18:00,050 --> 02:18:02,600
Evan, ten seconds Tomahawks close.

2303
02:18:02,610 --> 02:18:05,140
Fourth levi, echo echo 1 4 2 5 zero,

2304
02:18:05,140 --> 02:18:07,170
- Found surface contact. - Got an ID.

2305
02:18:07,170 --> 02:18:08,530
Target acquired.

2306
02:18:36,490 --> 02:18:37,580
Dylan!

2307
02:18:37,590 --> 02:18:39,820
- Right. - No!

2308
02:18:41,440 --> 02:18:43,310
- Shit. - Dylan.

2309
02:18:44,050 --> 02:18:45,650
Stop, stop.

2310
02:18:45,990 --> 02:18:46,940
No.

2311
02:18:47,800 --> 02:18:49,120
You can't do this.

2312
02:18:49,120 --> 02:18:50,110
Okay.

2313
02:18:50,280 --> 02:18:51,940
There's only one future for me.

2314
02:19:16,280 --> 02:19:17,940
Cybertron.

2315
02:19:18,230 --> 02:19:20,340
You are saved.

2316
02:19:20,570 --> 02:19:22,890
At last.

2317
02:19:30,600 --> 02:19:34,840
Oh, have you come to surrender?

2318
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:37,570
- Was it all worth it? - Obviously.

2319
02:19:37,570 --> 02:19:39,390
All your work to bring Sentinel back.

2320
02:19:39,390 --> 02:19:41,840
And now clearly he has all the power.

2321
02:19:42,220 --> 02:19:43,650
It's actually almost tragic.

2322
02:19:43,660 --> 02:19:47,090
You dare lecture me, slave.

2323
02:19:47,230 --> 02:19:49,720
Your decepticons finally conquering this planet.

2324
02:19:49,720 --> 02:19:50,940
And yet their leader wasn't you.

2325
02:19:50,940 --> 02:19:55,440
It will be me, it will always be me.

2326
02:19:56,700 --> 02:19:58,180
Any minute from now.

2327
02:19:58,970 --> 02:20:00,380
They'll be laughing.

2328
02:20:00,770 --> 02:20:02,680
You're Sentinels bitch.

2329
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:11,390
Again!

2330
02:20:26,660 --> 02:20:27,880
You chose sides.

2331
02:20:29,110 --> 02:20:30,370
You chose wrong.

2332
02:20:36,320 --> 02:20:39,030
Always the bravest of us.

2333
02:20:42,210 --> 02:20:45,090
But you could never make the hard decisions.

2334
02:20:45,260 --> 02:20:46,310
Now!

2335
02:20:47,790 --> 02:20:50,610
Our planet will survive.

2336
02:20:51,870 --> 02:20:52,870
No.

2337
02:21:02,840 --> 02:21:04,610
We were Gods once.

2338
02:21:04,610 --> 02:21:05,900
All of us.

2339
02:21:06,110 --> 02:21:07,110
But here,

2340
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:08,180
Please.

2341
02:21:08,300 --> 02:21:10,650
They'll only be one.

2342
02:21:21,830 --> 02:21:25,690
This is MY planet.

2343
02:21:36,430 --> 02:21:38,260
I just saved a whole other world.

2344
02:21:38,450 --> 02:21:39,560
You think you're a hero?

2345
02:21:39,560 --> 02:21:41,430
Huh, you think you're a hero.

2346
02:21:41,440 --> 02:21:42,400
No.

2347
02:21:42,670 --> 02:21:44,130
I'm just a messenger.

2348
02:21:51,260 --> 02:21:53,200
It's still connected.

2349
02:21:55,250 --> 02:21:56,670
Watch, wait up.

2350
02:21:56,840 --> 02:21:58,920
- B!  - Get going, get going. Let's move it.

2351
02:21:58,920 --> 02:22:00,630
Oh it's still connected.

2352
02:22:00,720 --> 02:22:02,950
Lets lock it that.

2353
02:22:26,290 --> 02:22:27,440
No.

2354
02:22:28,150 --> 02:22:29,970
We need a truce.

2355
02:22:29,970 --> 02:22:33,500
All I wanted was to be back in charge.

2356
02:22:33,730 --> 02:22:35,260
Besides...

2357
02:22:35,690 --> 02:22:38,350
Who would you be without me?

2358
02:22:38,350 --> 02:22:39,640
Prime.

2359
02:22:39,660 --> 02:22:41,990
Time to find out.

2360
02:23:04,570 --> 02:23:07,660
Optimus. All I ever wanted,

2361
02:23:07,670 --> 02:23:10,390
was the survival of our race.

2362
02:23:10,700 --> 02:23:15,120
You must see why I had to betray you.

2363
02:23:15,210 --> 02:23:17,420
You didn't betray me.

2364
02:23:17,940 --> 02:23:20,320
You betrayed yourself.

2365
02:23:20,630 --> 02:23:22,500
No, Optimus!

2366
02:24:18,340 --> 02:24:19,310
Sam.

2367
02:24:59,260 --> 02:25:00,570
I love you.

2368
02:25:01,120 --> 02:25:02,340
I love you.

2369
02:25:03,470 --> 02:25:04,620
You're the only thing I need in this world.

2370
02:25:04,620 --> 02:25:06,920
And I'll do anything to make it up to you, I promise.

2371
02:25:08,150 --> 02:25:09,800
I'm gonna hold you to that.

2372
02:25:11,030 --> 02:25:12,620
Just never let me go.

2373
02:25:13,080 --> 02:25:14,360
Promise.

2374
02:25:20,210 --> 02:25:21,380
Rings.

2375
02:25:29,440 --> 02:25:31,160
I love this car.

2376
02:25:31,160 --> 02:25:32,930
But, you gotta slow down.

2377
02:25:33,310 --> 02:25:35,350
You gotta slow way down. Okay.

2378
02:25:35,750 --> 02:25:37,750
I'm just trying to help out.

2379
02:25:39,160 --> 02:25:40,880
In any war.

2380
02:25:41,050 --> 02:25:43,970
There are calms, between storms.

2381
02:25:44,710 --> 02:25:48,760
- You fought bravely. - There will be days when we loose faith.

2382
02:25:48,760 --> 02:25:51,740
Days when our allies turn against us.

2383
02:25:52,240 --> 02:25:54,480
But the day will never come.

2384
02:25:54,480 --> 02:25:56,960
That we forsake this planet.

2385
02:25:56,960 --> 02:25:58,540
And it's people.

2386
02:26:20,620 --> 02:26:24,810
That's what I called such a beautiful future

2387
02:26:26,220 --> 02:26:27,440
Arrest him

2388
02:26:28,360 --> 02:26:29,490
- It's worthy it - Get him out of here

2389
02:26:29,490 --> 02:26:31,610
I just got her for the love. I don't care.

2390
02:26:31,610 --> 02:26:36,770
I want going. Take me in. I want going. Let's going
