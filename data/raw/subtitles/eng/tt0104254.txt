1
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,100
Our world was much larger then.

2
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,500
The forest went on for ever.

3
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,300
We tree spirits nurtured
the harmony of all living things.

4
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,000
But our closest friends were humans.

5
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,000
Then, as sometimes happens,
the balance of nature shifted.

6
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,300
And Hexxus, the very spirit of destruction,

7
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,900
rose up from the bowels of the earth
and rained down his poison.

8
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,700
The forest was nearly destroyed.

9
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:43,200
Many lives were lost and the humans
fled in fear, never to return.

10
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,400
Most think they didn't survive.

11
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,100
It was only by calling up
the magical powers of nature

12
00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:02,300
that I was able to trap Hexxus inside
an enchanted tree and save FernGully.

13
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,600
Which is why it is so important
for you to learn to use these powers.

14
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,700
I won't be around for ever and you have to...

15
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,100
Crysta?

16
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,100
Yes.

17
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,100
That is why it is so important
for you to learn the secrets of...

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,900
- Crysta!
- Magi, yes. The secrets.

19
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,000
I know. But, I mean, it's all right now.

20
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,500
That was so long ago and you trapped
him in that tree and everything, so...

21
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,700
I really have to go now.
But I'll see you later, OK? Bye.

22
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,200
- Hey!
- Pips.

23
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,600
You're spending more time
with Magi than you do with me.

24
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,200
Well, what can I learn from you?

25
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,400
Hey!

26
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,600
# When the sleepy planet comes alive

27
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,600
# And I wake up in the warm sunlight

28
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,200
# There's a simple harmony to life

29
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,000
# A magic thing

30
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,800
# Then I walk among the flowers and trees

31
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,600
# It's a magic thing

32
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,000
# And I feel the earth beneath my feet

33
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,400
# It's a magic thing

34
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,900
# And I remember that the air we breathe

35
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,500
# Is a magic thing

36
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,800
# Everybody now

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,100
# Life is a magic

38
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,600
# Thing

39
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,600
# Yeah, yeah

40
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,700
# Life is a magic

41
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,600
# Thing

42
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
# Yeah, yeah, yeah

43
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,100
# Life is a magic

44
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,600
# Thing

45
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,500
# Yeah, yeah

46
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,300
# Yeah

47
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,600
# Life is a magic

48
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,200
# Thing

49
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,000
# Yeah, yeah, yeah

50
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,400
# Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

51
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,400
There they go. Come on. Don't lose her.

52
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,000
Whoa!

53
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,400
OK.

54
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,100
Crysta, stop!

55
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,100
Never, never go above the canopy.
Never go above the canopy.

56
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,100
Crysta!

57
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,200
Crysta!

58
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,500
I got ya.

59
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,300
Are you crazy, going above the canopy?!

60
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,200
Yeah, we was almost falcon fodder.

61
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,500
- I've got to tell Magi.
- Tell Magi what?

62
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Hey, wait. What... what'd you see...

63
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,700
up there?

64
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,300
- Halt! Who goes there?
- Hi, Crysta.

65
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,300
- OK, what's the password?
- Oh, come on, you guys.

66
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,200
- Is that the password?
- It sounds good.

67
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,700
- Bye.
- "Bye. " That's it. That's the password.

68
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,300
I don't know if it is or not. I'm so confused.

69
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,400
Magi?

70
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Magi?

71
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,600
Oh, Magi. I just saw the most
incredible thing above the canopy.

72
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,500
A whole other world. The sky went on
for ever. And way over in the distance,

73
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,000
as far as I could see,
there was this enormous rock.

74
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,000
- Like a...
- Mountain.

75
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:02,700
- That was Mount Warning.
- And next to it was a... a... I don't know.

76
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,000
It looked like a strange black cloud
rising out of the earth.

77
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,700
- Smoke, I should think.
- What's smoke?

78
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,300
Oh, there are many things in our world
you don't yet know about, Crysta.

79
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,200
There are worlds within worlds, Crysta.

80
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,800
Everything in our world is connected
by the delicate strands of the web of life,

81
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,900
which is balanced between
forces of destruction

82
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,800
and the magic forces of creation.

83
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,600
Help it grow.

84
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Why can't I do it?

85
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,200
Everyone can call on
the magic powers of the web of life.

86
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,700
You have to find it in yourself.

87
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,600
I want to, Magi. You know I do.

88
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,900
But I was thinking about that smoke.

89
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,200
Do you think it could be... Hexxus?

90
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,100
No, there's no force in nature
that could release him,

91
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,000
and there are no poisons here
on which he can feed.

92
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,300
Hexxus is trapped, for all time.

93
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,000
- Now, that's enough for today.
- But what could have caused the smoke?

94
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,400
- Now, now, now, off with you.
- But, Magi...

95
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,100
Hexxus.

96
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,200
So what'd the Mag have to say, huh?

97
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,800
She said I should get serious.

98
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,500
About time.

99
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,600
And stop hanging around
with bug-brain layabouts like you.

100
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,800
Oh, no!

101
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,300
Red light.

102
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,300
Red light again.

103
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,800
Immediate clearance. Request
immediate clearance. Oh, no!

104
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Crysta!

105
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,000
Hello?

106
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,300
Aaaah!

107
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,200
Bless your heart with magic light.
I give the gift of fairy sight.

108
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,200
Oh, what a strange little bug.

109
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
I did it. I did it!

110
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
Oh! Gravity works.

111
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,100
Oh, poor guy.

112
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
Oh.

113
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,000
Hey, Premier Testing Laboratory.
No! Pass the probe.

114
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,300
- Graduate students, all gather forward. No!
- Love the haircut.

115
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,100
It's all right. We won't hurt you.

116
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,300
- He's still a little confused.
- Clearly.

117
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:06,600
I'm a nocturnal, flying mammal. A member of
the family of Pterodidae. Or Ptero-didn't-ae!

118
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,100
If you can't tell, I'm a bat!

119
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,400
Yes, I am. And they used
to call me Batty. Batty Koda.

120
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,100
Nice to meet you. Bonjour.

121
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,100
And where are you from?

122
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,900
I just blew in from a biology lab.
I'm back and I'm flapping free.

123
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,400
Let me tell you a story, and it's all about...

124
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,000
# Yo, the name is Batty

125
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,700
# The logic is erratic

126
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,500
# Potato in ajacket

127
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,100
# Toys in the attic

128
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,700
# I rock and I ramble

129
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,700
# My brain is scrambled

130
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,400
# Rap like an animal

131
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,100
# But I'm a mammal

132
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,300
All of our cosmetics are non-carcinogenic.

133
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,700
# I've been brain-fried, electrified,
infected and injectified

134
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,400
# Vivisectified and fed pesticide

135
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,000
# My face is all cut up
cos my radar's all shut up

136
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,100
# Nurse

137
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,000
# I need a checkup from the neck up

138
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,400
# I'm Batty

139
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,900
- It seems to have no effect, Doctor
- Get me another one. Get me another animal.

140
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,900
# They used and abused me

141
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,400
# Battered and bruised me

142
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,200
# Red wires, green wires,
stuck 'em right through me

143
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,200
# So hear my Batty word
and exercise a little prudence

144
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,000
# When dealing with

145
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,200
- Humans.
- Humans?

146
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,400
Where? No, no, no, no, no, no.

147
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,000
Lucy!

148
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,800
- No, no, there are no humans.
- They're long gone.

149
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,000
- Vanished.
- Definitely extinct.

150
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,300
They only exist in stories.

151
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,000
- Excuse me.
- Oh, charming.

152
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,300
It's been lovely, but I gotta hoon.

153
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,600
Adios, amigos. Ting! Check, please.

154
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,200
Oh, father, do you think it's possible?
Could humans still exist?

155
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,400
Now, Crysta,

156
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,400
don't you think you're a little old
to believe in human tales?

157
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,800
Human tails? Humans don't have tails.

158
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,800
They have big, big bottoms
that they wear with bad shorts.

159
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,200
They walk around going "Hi, Helen!"

160
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,800
Did you really see humans?
Were they at Mount Warning?

161
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,200
Oh, masses of homo sapiens.

162
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,200
Hey! Where are you going?

163
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,600
Yeah, this territory looks kinda familiar.

164
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,900
Fabulous day in the canopy, isn't it?

165
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,200
- Now, where do you think you're going?
- Mount Warning.

166
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,700
I know where I am. I know where I am.

167
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,900
Hey! You scared me there.

168
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,900
I thought you said you were
going to Mount Warning.

169
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,100
Well, I did.

170
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,500
But there are humans on Mount Warning!

171
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,100
- Exactly.
- Fractured figs, fairy bug! Come on!

172
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:20,100
Mount Warning is the last place in
the world a little bug like you wants to go.

173
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,400
Look at these. Do you think nature did this?

174
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,200
Do you think I put this in to get better
reception? No! Humans did this.

175
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,100
We should stay here. It's nice here.

176
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,500
Come on. You got a great set of wings.
Let's just flutter for a while.

177
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,600
- Ooooh!
- Batty?

178
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,700
Batty!

179
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,800
Well, come on.

180
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,200
My heart. Ah! Oh, my heart.

181
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,300
I can't go on. Help me.
My little wings can't make it.

182
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,100
Hm. Maybe you should wait here for me.

183
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,300
It's a fabulous idea. I really
think we should fly with that.

184
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,200
Only, why don't you stay here with me?

185
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,200
It's OK, really. I'll be right back.

186
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,300
Why do I not believe you?

187
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,600
- How you comin' in your quadrant, Pete?
- All done here.

188
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,100
- How about you, Willy?
- Finito, good buddy.

189
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,800
How about you, Zak?

190
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,600
Zak?

191
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,200
Zak? Za-a-a-a-ak?

192
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,100
Yeah, yeah. What's the big deal?

193
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,000
You finished marking those trees yet?

194
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,600
I'm gettin' to it. Don't have a cow. Sheesh.

195
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,400
He's a city kid. Comes
up here for a summerjob.

196
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,800
- He doesn't take it seriously.
- That kid don't belong in the woods.

197
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,300
Freaky.

198
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,200
Ah! Heh, heh, heh. Gotcha.

199
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,800
Hexxus-s-s-s.

200
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,900
Aw, man!

201
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,600
- Huh?
- Look out!

202
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:19,600
Bless your eyes with magic light.
I give the gift of fairy size. Oh... sight!

203
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,100
No!

204
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,300
Lift. I need lift.

205
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,600
"Don't go" I said. "Bad idea" I said.

206
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,100
But would you listen? No.
Don't listen to Batty. Uh-uh.

207
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,800
Well, what have we here? Shoes.

208
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,600
Animals don't wear shoes. A human!

209
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,400
A tree!

210
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:08,000
Take anything you want.
I won't tell the cops. Huh?

211
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,100
- Are you all right?
- Ah! I'm fine.

212
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,500
- What is going on here?
- The monster, it tried to eat you.

213
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,100
- Monster?
- My friend and I saved you.

214
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,700
Oh, Batty. Batty?

215
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,100
Oh, sonic interference - what a nightmare.

216
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,400
I thought I saw a human.

217
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,100
Ah! Human!

218
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:48,100
- That's a human?
- Yes, yes. Kill it. Restrain it. Medicate it.

219
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,700
- Puff up. Puff up. They hate that.
- No.

220
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,400
- Aaah!
- Back. Back. Get back. Don't worry.

221
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,600
- I've got it scared.
- I have but one claw, but beware.

222
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,700
- Will you both just calm down?
- He's trying to kill you!

223
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,100
- I did not. You did!
- Hold on!

224
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,200
The only thing that tried to kill anybody
was that horrible monster in the forest.

225
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,000
Monster? What monster?

226
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,600
The one that ate the tree. It was terrible.

227
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,100
Tree?

228
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:28,000
The leveller. Hey! Am... am I dead?

229
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,300
- No.
- We could fix that for ya.

230
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,700
- Then I must be dreaming.
- Nope.

231
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:39,200
Ah, sure. And what are you
supposed to be? Some kind of fairy?

232
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,700
Of course I am. What about you?
Are you really a human?

233
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,400
Last time I checked.

234
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,700
Listen, fairy, it's been weird,
but I'm outta here. This dream is history.

235
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,800
Argh!

236
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,800
Argh!

237
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,900
Ha, ha! Whoo!

238
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,000
Check this out.

239
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,400
# I've a basic inclination

240
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,700
# A very primal need

241
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,100
# To inspect the vegetation

242
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,500
# For an egg or centipede

243
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,200
# I just can't control this hunger

244
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,800
# I just can't seem to cut it back

245
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,900
# For my ravenous consumption

246
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,500
# You're a welcome little snack

247
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,400
# If I'm gonna eat somebody

248
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,200
# It might as well be you

249
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,300
# Can you dig it?

250
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,100
# I can see you as a sandwich

251
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,600
# Or a strange, exotic stew

252
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,300
# Floating down the river

253
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,600
# Like an oyster in a stew

254
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,800
# He's gonna eat somebody

255
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,700
# It might as well be you

256
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,300
# You know it

257
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,300
# Kick it one time

258
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,300
# Welcome to the food chain

259
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,400
No! You can't eat him. He's a human.

260
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,800
Uh... what's a human?

261
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,500
Delicious and nutritious.
Tastes just like chicken.

262
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,200
He's my friend.

263
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,200
Well, any friend of a fairy...

264
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,900
- is a friend of mine.
- Thanks a lot.

265
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,200
Aw, man. You owe me
a free dinner after this one.

266
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,900
- Are you OK?
- Argh! What happened to me?

267
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,400
I'm... I'm three inches tall.

268
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,400
- Oh... I shrank you.
- You what?!

269
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,000
Look, it was the most amazing thing.

270
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,900
It's not what the spell's really supposed
to do. But Magi Lune will fix you.

271
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,700
You... you've shrank me?

272
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,300
- Yeah.
- Catches on quick, doesn't he?

273
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,700
- We better buzz off. It's getting late.
- Buzz off? I'm not buzzing anywhere.

274
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,300
No. Unshrink me. And I mean now!

275
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,600
- Well, I guess I could take a bash at it.
- Take a bash?

276
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,500
- Actually, I'm just sort of learning.
- Great! I've been shrunk by an amateur.

277
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,300
I don't believe this. OK, OK.
Come on. Bash away.

278
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,200
OK.

279
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,900
What was done, now undo.
Return you to the form that's true.

280
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,100
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Big ears. Elephant.

281
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,700
No, no, no, no, no. Anteater.

282
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,100
Orang-utan. OK, let me guess again.
Oh, wait. A duck. A duck.

283
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,500
Oh, it's Darwin's grab bag.

284
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,700
- Let me try again.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

285
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,400
No, no, no!

286
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,600
Thank you, but I think maybe
we better go see this Magi.

287
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,200
I'm Zak.

288
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,500
I'm Crysta.

289
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,900
Nice to meet you.

290
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:42,600
You're going to love FernGully. It's the most
beautiful, wonderful place in the forest.

291
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,700
- Well, come on. Batty can carry you.
- Moi? Uh-uh.

292
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:52,100
Not this little mammal. Fly a human?
I'd rather suck wax fruit.

293
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,600
- Hey.
- What?

294
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,600
- You see Zak anywhere?
- No. His shift's about over.

295
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,400
- He probably cut out early.
- That's the problem with the world today.

296
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,300
- People are lazy.
- I heard that with my bad ear.

297
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,800
- What is that?
- Hey, Tone.

298
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,600
- You think the leveller can handle this baby?
- Sure. That leveller eats everything.

299
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,600
Kinda like you.

300
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,200
How many times a day
I gotta threaten your life?

301
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,700
Hexxus-s-s-s.

302
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,300
I've got so many things I want to ask you.

303
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,400
Like "Why have humans
returned to the forest?"

304
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,500
And what was that monster
that tried to eat you?

305
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,900
That wasn't a monster.

306
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,200
It was a machine.

307
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:11,700
- What's a machine?
- It's a... a thing for cutting down trees.

308
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,000
- That's terrible.
- Only if you live in a tree.

309
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,500
- I do live in a tree.
- Oh.

310
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:27,000
You didn't have anything to do
with that... machine, did you?

311
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,500
Uh... What? Me?

312
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,000
No! No, no, no. Of course not.

313
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:41,800
Oops. How could I have anything to do
with something that eats trees?

314
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,400
- Could it come to FernGully?
- Oh, no, no. Of course not.

315
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,400
- You've got nothing to worry about.
- Why?

316
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,400
Because... it's trapped.

317
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,100
Oh, I know - by those red marks.

318
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,500
It can't go past them. They must be magic.

319
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,200
Yeah. You know, you're pretty smart, fairy.

320
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,500
I want to learn magic like yours.

321
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,900
Yeah? Uh... Well, here.

322
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,200
Come... come here.

323
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Ah! What is it?

324
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,900
It's fire.

325
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,200
That's fire?

326
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,600
- Ow!
- Careful.

327
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,100
Mm. Delicious.

328
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,800
A first-class smoke.

329
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,700
Mother's milk.

330
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,800
And what is this delightful thing?

331
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,600
And how did I get out of that tree?

332
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,900
Of course. Humans.

333
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,900
What wonderful creatures.
So clever. So helpful.

334
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:56,800
I must take this wonderful
human thing to... FernGully.

335
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,100
New orders, boys.

336
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,600
You're going to FernGully.

337
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,200
And I want you there by morning.

338
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,000
By mornin'? I don't know if we can do that.

339
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,700
You'll just have to work harder, then.

340
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,800
Double shifts. No breaks-s-s.

341
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:24,100
- No breaks?
- And make sure ya got plenty of oil.

342
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,500
Roger that. We'll give it a gas.

343
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,200
Hey, Tone, you know what this means?

344
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,200
Yeah.

345
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,200
Beaucoup overtime.

346
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,100
What a miraculous device.

347
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,300
I'm really getting the hang of this.

348
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,600
I do believe we are destined to be soul mates.

349
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,500
# Hit me one time

350
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,000
# Hit me twice

351
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,900
# Oh, ah

352
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,100
# Ohhh

353
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,400
# That's rather nice

354
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,900
# Oil and grime

355
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,200
# Poison sludge

356
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:18,100
# Diesel clouds and noxious muck

357
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,200
# Slime beneath me

358
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,100
# Mm, slime up above

359
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,600
# Ooh, you'll love my

360
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,700
# Oh, oh, oh

361
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,600
# Toxic love

362
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:44,200
# I see the world and all the creatures in it

363
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,000
# All the creatures in it

364
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,500
# I suck 'em dry

365
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,800
# And spit 'em out like spinach

366
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,300
# Cos greedy human beings

367
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,100
# Will always lend a hand

368
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:05,000
# With the destruction
of this worthless jungle land

369
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,500
# And what a beautiful machine

370
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,400
# They have provided

371
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,200
# To slice a path of doom

372
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,600
# With my sweet breath to guide it

373
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,800
Waaah! Ha, ha!

374
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:32,100
# Filthy brown acid rain

375
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:38,900
# Pouring down like egg chow mein

376
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,200
# Slime beneath me

377
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:45,500
# Mm, slime up above

378
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,900
# Ooh, you'll love my

379
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,200
# Oh, oh, oh

380
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,700
# Toxic love

381
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,500
Crysta!

382
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,100
Crysta!

383
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,500
- Any sign of her?
- Ah, let's go back.

384
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:24,700
- She's probably back home havin' dinner.
- Yeah, she's somebody else's dinner.

385
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,600
She's fine. Now, keep lookin'.

386
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,700
- We're lookin'. We're lookin'.
- Yeah, we're lookin'.

387
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,400
- Look at us look.
- What are we lookin' for?

388
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,700
Oh, look.

389
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,500
Look.

390
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,200
Is that what we're lookin' for?

391
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,900
This is so incredible.

392
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,400
What are the trees like where you live?

393
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,800
Not like this. I live in a city.

394
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,300
- Ciddy?
- Yeah.

395
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,300
Buildings.

396
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,600
Traffic. Roads. Lights.

397
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,300
A city.

398
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,900
Most humans live in cities.

399
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,000
- There's not many trees there.
- But how can you live without trees?

400
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,800
- Easy.
- But trees give life.

401
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
- They make the clouds, the rain, the air.
- Oh, we've got air.

402
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,200
Yeah, if you don't mind getting
all your minerals in one breath.

403
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,600
Don't you miss talking to the forest?

404
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,100
Can't say I've actually
talked with a forest before.

405
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:42,300
- I do all the time.
- Ah! What does it say?

406
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,300
Well, listen.

407
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,600
# It's raining like magic

408
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,200
# It's falling like starlight

409
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,200
# It's raining like magic

410
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,300
# It's raining life

411
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,600
# The forest is breathing

412
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,200
# And ferns are rejoicing

413
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,400
# The trees are all singing

414
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,500
# Hey, it's raining life

415
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,300
# Raining like magic

416
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:12,100
# La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

417
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,800
# It's raining life

418
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
So, what about you, Crysta.
I mean, what do fairies do anyway?

419
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,500
- Do?
- Yeah, I mean, do you have jobs or anything?

420
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,300
What... what's ajob?

421
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,000
I guess that answers that question.

422
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,500
- Look, um, what do you do all day?
- Mm, help things grow.

423
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,600
- Yeah? That sounds cool.
- No, usually it's warm.

424
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,400
- No, no. Cool means hot.
- What?

425
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:41,100
Yeah. You know, bodacious, bad, tubular.

426
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,600
Awesome use of the language, dude.

427
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:48,600
As in "You are one bodacious babe. "

428
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,300
And that's good? I mean, cool?

429
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,900
Yeah. We're communicating now.

430
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,200
Tubular.

431
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,300
Morning.

432
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,200
- What are you doing?
- Carving your name.

433
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,100
- See? C-r-y-s...
- No, no. You mustn't do that.

434
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,300
Here.

435
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,000
- Can't you feel its pain?
- Its pain?

436
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,300
Humans can't feel anything.
They're numb from the brain down.

437
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,100
Oh, Zak.

438
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,600
He doesn't understand.

439
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,700
Did I say somethin' wrong?

440
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,900
So, uh, which way to FernGully?

441
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,700
Ha, ha, ha, ha. Isn't this great?

442
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,200
Wow!

443
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:37,200
- What is this place?
- This is FernGully.

444
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,300
Argh!

445
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,300
Hey, Crysta, what's this?

446
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,300
Careful, Stump. He's a human.

447
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,400
Hey, hey, hey, how does it taste?

448
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,600
Got it.

449
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,700
- A hooman?
- Is this what we're lookin' for?

450
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,700
Yaboshi!

451
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,100
- Crysta!
- Hey! That's my human.

452
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,500
Oh, no!

453
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,000
Ow! Ow! I'm blind. Oh, no!

454
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,700
I can see. It's a miracle.

455
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,000
Another perfect landing.

456
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,400
No worries. I'm OK.

457
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,800
Thank you for caring.
It was just a few bruises.

458
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,900
- Nobody cares about me.
- I do, Batman.

459
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,500
- You sure?
- I'm positive.

460
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,800
- Only fools are positive.
- Are you sure?

461
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:42,300
I'm positive. I fell for it. I should have known.

462
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,500
Zak.

463
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,400
Crysta, we were so worried about y...

464
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,300
- What's that?
- Father, I'd like you to meet Zak.

465
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,700
- Hi.
- He's a bodacious babe.

466
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,100
- A what?
- He's a human.

467
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,800
Somehow I thought they'd be... bigger.

468
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,200
Well, I had a little accident
and he sort of shrank.

469
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,600
Butjust think - humans, back in the forest.

470
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,900
- Yeah, there goes the neighbourhood.
- Be nice, Batty.

471
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,700
First thing, all these trees go. Then
come your highways, your shopping malls,

472
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,000
your parking lots and your
convenience stores. And then come...

473
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,200
Price check on prune juice, Bob.
Price check on prune juice.

474
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:41,600
Crysta! Where you been?
I've been looking all over for ya.

475
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,100
Pips, you won't believe what I found.

476
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,600
- Isn't he amazing?
- Should we be charging admission for this?

477
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:54,400
That's all you got to say? I've been out all
night and you show me this weird creature?

478
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:58,300
This weird creature is a human.

479
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,500
Hm. He's kinda small, ain't he?

480
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,600
Look out!

481
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,900
- What is it?
- I don't know.

482
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:24,300
Pips, why don't you tell us
about your strange treasure?

483
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,300
Oh, well, it's simple, really.

484
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:33,700
It's hard like stone, yet... yet it's hollow.

485
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:40,500
And, uh, yeah, it has this little
vine coming out of it, and... and...

486
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,300
It's my stereo.

487
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,400
Look, I found it, so I'll explain it, all right?

488
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,700
OK, then what is it?

489
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,900
Well, it's obviously a...

490
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:56,000
- Yeah? Yeah?
- Obviously it's a...

491
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,600
- It's alive.
- And it's noisy.

492
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,500
It's a recording - of music.

493
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:16,300
Well, I don't know what a recording is, but
I know what music is, and that is not music.

494
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,100
Come on, everybody! Gather round.

495
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,200
# Nah, na na, na nah

496
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,900
# Na na, na nah, na na, nah, na na, nah

497
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,300
# Na, na, na, nah

498
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,200
# I need somebody to help me. Come on!

499
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,300
# Nah, na na, na nah

500
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,500
# Na na, na nah, na na, nah, na na, nah

501
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:35,300
Come on. Move. Move. Move.
Move. Move. Get the beat.

502
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,200
# You gotta know how to pony

503
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,800
# Like Bony Moroney

504
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,300
Audio pollution. Oh!

505
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,900
# Do the hot potato

506
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,500
# Do the alligator

507
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,200
# Put your hands on your hips, yeah

508
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,400
# Let your backbone slip

509
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,800
# Do the Watusi

510
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,200
# My little Lucy

511
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,300
# Come on

512
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,600
# Nah, na na, na nah

513
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:05,200
# Na na, na nah, na na, nah, na na, nah

514
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,600
# Nah, na na, nah

515
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,900
# Nah, na na, na nah

516
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,500
# Na na, na nah, na na, nah, na na, nah

517
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,600
# Nah, na na, nah

518
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,700
# Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

519
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,700
# This song feels good, yeah

520
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,500
# Like I knew it would

521
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,200
# Feel all right

522
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,400
# You know, we're down in the alley

523
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,600
# With Long Tall Sally

524
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,700
# Twisting with Lucy

525
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,800
# Doing the Watusi

526
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,900
# Roll over on your back, yeah

527
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,100
# I like it like that

528
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,000
# Hope you do the jerk

529
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:50,700
# And then watch me, watch me,
watch me work

530
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,000
Why don't you come with me and the boys?
We'll give you a taste of real wildlife.

531
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,100
Unless, of course, you're not up to it, Zak.

532
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:01,000
I'm up to anything you can dish out, Bud.

533
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,700
Not now, Pips.

534
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:11,200
- Nuts.
- Come on, Zak.

535
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,400
Hey! Hey! Where they goin'?

536
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,500
See you around, Zag.

537
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,800
Wow.

538
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,600
# Anytime you want to be right here

539
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:13,500
# Just imagine me and all this will appear

540
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:19,300
# You can keep this moment all your life

541
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:23,700
# For ever near

542
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:27,800
# A dream worth keeping

543
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,800
# When you're feeling lost

544
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,600
# I'll be your star

545
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:42,900
# Just reach out and touch me,
no matter where you are

546
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:51,600
# In a world where precious things
are disappearing overnight

547
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:57,500
# Just keep my star in sight

548
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:06,800
# I believe we've found a dream
that's worth keeping

549
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,600
# For more than just today

550
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:20,400
# And even though the winds of change
may come sweeping

551
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:26,100
# It's still a dream worth keeping

552
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:35,200
# So don't let it fade away

553
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,400
# Someday you might be thinking

554
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:44,000
# That life has passed you by

555
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,700
# Your spirits might be sinking

556
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:51,300
# With hope in short supply

557
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,000
# And that's the reason why

558
00:47:55,300 --> 00:48:03,600
# That's the reason why

559
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:09,300
# I know this dream's worth keeping

560
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:13,200
# As long as it will stay

561
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:22,300
# Even when you see
the darkness come creeping

562
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,700
# A dream worth keeping

563
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:36,800
# Will never fade away

564
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,800
Well, I guess I'd better go
find Magi and get you unshrunk.

565
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,700
- There's no hurry.
- No, I promised.

566
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,100
Let it wait till tomorrow. Come here.

567
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,100
No, I've got to tell her about you anyway.

568
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,100
Wait here. I'll be back
as soon as I can find her.

569
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,800
Can't you feel its pain?

570
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,200
Oil.

571
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,800
The leveller.

572
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,100
Oh, no.

573
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,400
Run, little ones. We'll catch up
to you in the FernGully soon enough.

574
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,600
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

575
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,500
Magi?

576
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,100
Magi?

577
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:20,700
Oh, Magi, I've got so much to tell you. I went
to Mount Warning and I found a human.

578
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,400
Well, come on. I want you to meet him.

579
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,800
Magi? What's wrong?

580
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,600
Magi, can you heal it?

581
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:51,300
A force outside of nature did this.

582
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:55,000
I can't heal it and I can't stop it.

583
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:01,800
Zak can. I know what did this, Magi.
A monster the humans fight.

584
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,900
Humans can stop it. They have
these magic red marks that...

585
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,900
But Zak said...

586
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:44,700
Humans did it. Humans did it all.

587
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,900
Crysta!

588
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,500
- Hey! What's going on, Zak?
- What are you talkin' about?

589
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,100
You know exactly what
I'm talking about: The forest.

590
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:07,900
- You know what's happening, don't you?
- Good idea. Ask the human. He may know.

591
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,400
- Crysta.
- You lied to me.

592
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,300
I... Crysta.

593
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,700
I wish...

594
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,000
I wish the human tales were true.

595
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,600
They're not here to protect the forest.

596
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:36,600
They're cutting down trees.
They're destroying the forest.

597
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:41,300
And I was helping them do it.

598
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,300
- Batty was right.
- I was?

599
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,500
They're coming this way.
You can't stop them.

600
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,000
You'll have to leave.

601
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:03,400
The humans have released Hexxus.

602
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:07,500
Gather everyone in the circle.

603
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:20,500
You know, Zak, truth doesn't always win
friends, but it certainly influences people.

604
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,100
You're not half bad for a hominid.

605
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,600
Father?

606
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:06,100
Since the beginning of time, we have been
the guardians and the healers of the forest.

607
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:11,200
We have too long forgotten
the magic powers of nature.

608
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:15,800
The time has come to call on them again.

609
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:25,000
Remember, all the magic of creation
exists within a single, tiny seed.

610
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,600
We must go to Magi.

611
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:38,300
Look for the hero inside yourself, Crysta.

612
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:43,100
Look to the good and loving
heart in you and all others.

613
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:47,100
Forjust as every seed holds
the power and magic of creation,

614
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:53,200
so, too, do you and every
other creature in this world.

615
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,600
Magi, don't leave me.

616
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:06,500
I love you. I'll always be with you.

617
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:13,500
We all have a power,
and it grows when it is shared.

618
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:16,400
Remember what you've learned, Crysta.

619
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Oh, Magi.

620
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,500
Ha, ha. I'm back.

621
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,600
Hexxus.

622
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:24,400
Tony! Ralph! Stop!

623
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,600
Come on.

624
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,600
Hey! It's safer in here.

625
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,200
Coming through!

626
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,900
A fairy fortification.

627
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:52,000
Crysta, we've got to get everyone out of here.

628
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,700
- No!
- Crysta!

629
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:57,300
We can't. We've got nowhere else to go.

630
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,800
This is our home.

631
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,600
Zak.

632
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:11,900
- This is the last time I save you, human.
- No, Batty, take me back to the leveller.

633
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:16,000
- Are you crazy? That's lemming talk.
- Wrong channel.

634
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,200
Oh, Caesar, Emperor of Rome.

635
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:25,400
- Wrong channel.
- We're going to war.

636
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:29,300
Yes, back to the camp. Batty, let's go!

637
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:37,100
Fasten your seat belts.
It's going to be a bumpy night.

638
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:41,900
We're goin' in full throttle. That oughta
keep those rebel fighters off our tail.

639
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,200
Lock and load, gentlemen.

640
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,500
Time to rock and roll.

641
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:51,700
- Tora! Tora! Tora!
- No, no, no. Batty, to the cap, to the cap.

642
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,700
Bogey, bogey at three o'clock.
Red leader, red leader.

643
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,100
Did you see that? It looked
like some kind of flying rat.

644
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:02,800
Aye aye, Cap'n. I can't get enough speed.
We got no dilithium crystals.

645
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:07,000
- Oh, no!
- Batty, watch out!

646
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,400
Oh, this is gonna hurt.

647
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,200
Oh, no!

648
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,500
Argh!

649
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,000
Hey, Tone. There's a little man
on the windshield here.

650
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,600
Tony! Ralph! It's me! It's Zak!

651
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:32,700
- Hey, hey, hey, Tone.
- Keep it moving, boys.

652
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,700
Aarrgghh!

653
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,400
You need a set of your own wings.

654
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,500
Here's your first flyin' lesson, Zak.

655
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:10,700
Thanks.

656
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:15,000
I should have sprayed for pests.

657
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:18,100
Mm! Lovely wings.

658
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,600
So easily detached.

659
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:57,000
What happened to the energy?

660
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:58,400
All the magic of creation
exists within a single, tiny seed.

661
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:25,100
- Crysta!
- No, no.

662
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,200
Come on!

663
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,400
Help it grow!

664
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,400
Come on, guys!

665
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,300
Come on!

666
01:05:55,400 --> 01:06:00,300
- Oh, Crysta's gone.
- I wish she were here with us now.

667
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:05,600
Oh, look.

668
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,800
We did it, Zak.

669
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:31,000
Now Hexxus can never harm FernGully again.

670
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:35,000
But humans still could.

671
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,600
That's why I have to go back.

672
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:42,100
There's a part of me that really wants to stay.

673
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:46,700
There's a part of you that will always stay.

674
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:56,200
Remember, Zak.

675
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,800
Remember everything.

676
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,700
- Keep the stereo, dude.
- Thanks... dude.

677
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,100
- Hey! He's not going already?
- He was a nice guy.

678
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:29,100
- He just needed wings.
- What was done, now undo.

679
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:33,800
Return you to the form... that's true.

680
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:37,300
Bye, Zak.

681
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:49,500
Oh.

682
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,500
Batty.

683
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,500
Oh! I've shrunk.

684
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:12,400
- Zak!
- What happened here?

685
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:31,500
I will remember.

686
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:41,200
Guys, things have gotta change.

687
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:45,300
Crysta, help it grow.

688
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:17,900
Hey! Where are you going?

689
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,300
# You stare through a tunnel of

690
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:06,400
# Solid wall that should be broken down

691
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:10,900
# And you can't see the field of green

692
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:15,300
