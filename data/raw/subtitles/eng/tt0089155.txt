# Makin' my connection #

3
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:38,465
# Something's up #

4
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,473
# I can feel it in the air #

5
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:45,805
# Private eyes #

00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,473
# Never know who's watchin' #

00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:52,812
# Play it cool #

8
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,980
# But you haven't got a prayer #

00:00:58,324 --> 00:00:59,757

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,934
# Comin' through the grapevine #

14
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:14,463

25
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,280
My name is Erwin Fletcher.

26
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:05,824
I'm an investigative reporter
for a Los Angeles paper.

27
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:08,884
You've probably read my stuff
under the byline of Jane Doe.

28
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,328
Is better than Erwin.

29
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:14,389
Recently I've been
loitering around the beach...

30
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,766
trying to pass for
a minor league junkie.

31
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:20,362
I don't nod out or drool;
thas too obvious.

32
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,034
Act like you don't care
and you fit right in.

33
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,873
[Whistles]
Business has really picked up.

34
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,378
I'm still closed.

35
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,438
Is it a Colombian national holiday?

36
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,948
What do you figure, Sam?

37
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:37,717
No idea.

38
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,588
- No idea at all?
- Some idea.

39
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,991
Like when?

40
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,120
When it comes, it comes.

41
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:46,522
I got some reds.

42
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,491
You don't mean communists,
do you?

43
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,060
Is everything a joke
to you, Fletch?

44
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,662
Everything, Sam.

45
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:58,739
- Hey, Gummy!
- Hey, Fletch. Hey, Sam.

46
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,438
How's the eye?

47
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,538
Is OK.
The cops did it.

48
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,674
They always
beating up on me.

49
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,762
- He doesn't know.
- Son of a bitch!

50
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,467
Thas what he said.

51
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:34,035
He doesn't know?
How come he doesn't know?

52
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:36,343
I don't know.
He just doesn't know.

53
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,475
Son of a bitch!

54
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,743
I wonder how he
gets the stuff.

55
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,448
I have no idea.

56
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,650
Sam never leaves the beach.

57
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:49,058
He sits in that chair.
He's out of shit.

58
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:52,029
Suddenly he gets up,
he's got shit.

59
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,896
Where's it coming from?
The sand?

60
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,961
Thas highly unlikely, Grease.

61
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,333
I oughta get some sleep.

62
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,137
Grease, how old are you?

63
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:08,578
Nineteen.

64
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:12,442
You're not taking
very good care of yourself.

65
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,594
[Fletch]
If you haven't guessed, there's been
a lot of drug traffic on the beach.

66
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,894
I'm not talking about No-Doze.

67
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:30,163
I talkin' about the hard stuff.
A lot of it.

68
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:34,196
I've been trying to find out
who's behind it.

69
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,299
It hasn't been easy.

70
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,367
I don't shower much.

71
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,650
Excuse me. I have something
I'd like to discuss with you.

72
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:53,715
- Whas that?
- We can't talk about it here.

73
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,853
- Why not?
- Because we can't.

74
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:02,365
You on a scavenger hunt, or did I
forget to pay my dinner check?

75
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,869
Come to my house
to talk.

76
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,461
Wrong gal, fella.

77
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,564
I'll give you
$1,000 cash.

78
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,070
What?

79
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:15,203
Come to my house
and listen to the proposition.

80
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,811
If you reject the proposition,
you keep the thousand...

81
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,144
and your mouth shut.

82
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,252
Does this entail
my dressing up as Little Bo Peep?

83
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:35,161
- Is nothing of a sexual nature.
- Yeah.

84
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,327
One thousand just to listen?

85
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,997
How can you pass that up,
Mister...

86
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:43,099
Nugent. Ted Nugent.

87
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,576
Alan Stanwyk.

88
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,136
Alan, charmed.

89
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:53,608
For an extra grand, I'll let you
take me out to dinner.

90
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,903
What a coincidence.

91
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:18,876
What?

92
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,641
I almost bought
this place.

93
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,649
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy
killed himself here. Blew it for me.

94
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,810
- Who?
- Hopalong Cassidy.

95
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,650
Bow and arrow.
Very weird.

96
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,553
Are you doped up?

97
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:34,616
Don't talk to me like that.
I don't work for you.

98
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,228
- Buenos días.
- Buenos días.

99
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,289
Pup 'N' Taco.

100
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:46,361
Oh, you've remodeled
the garage.

101
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,498
Must have
cost you hundreds.

102
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,404
Good idea.
I oughta frame mine.

103
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,238
Will the Pope
be in later?

104
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,555
Here's my proposition.

105
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,158
I'm all ears.

106
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,169
I want you
to murder me.

107
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,439
Here...

108
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:24,976
on Thursday.

109
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,236
I'd like you
to shoot me dead.

110
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:36,415
The reason
I ask for this service...

111
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,117
is because I'm already facing
a very long...

112
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:42,684
painful and most certain death.

113
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,764
You see, I have bone cancer.

114
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:49,928
I don't know if you
know about bone cancer.

115
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:52,095
Is the worst kind you can get.

116
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:55,197
It just eats you up
bit by bit.

117
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,705
You don't look sick.

118
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,079
I don't feel sick. Not yet.

119
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,711
Ill get bad
in a month.

120
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,813
After that, I'd rather
not be around for it.

121
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,950
Why not try suicide?

122
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:15,721
I've thought about it.

123
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,992
My company's taken out
a large life insurance policy on me.

124
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:23,502
Suicide would nullify it,
but murder does not.

125
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,742
- Why me?
- You're a drifter.

126
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:35,338
A, uh... pardon the expression...
a junkie.

127
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:38,178
Nobody would notice
if you disappeared.

128
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:42,380
I've been watching you
for a couple of weeks.

129
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,616
Maybe I'm
just on vacation.

130
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,126
Not with the scum
you hang out with.

131
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,891
No, I've watched...
and I've thought.

132
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,693
Is an elegant plan.

133
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,893
I've even figured out
your escape.

134
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,367
Swell.

135
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:03,607
Has it ever occurred to you
I might not want to murder you?

136
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,443
I've got $50,000
says you will.

137
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,614
50,000.

138
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,674
And a guarantee you
won't get caught.

139
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,743
I'm still here.

140
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,114
I want it done Thursday
around 8:00 p.m.

141
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,853
My wife will be out,
and is the staff's night off.

142
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,193
- These will be open.
- Wouldn't they normally be locked?

143
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:28,028
Sometimes. The staff
usually forgets.

144
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,432
I have the same trouble
with my help.

145
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,768
I'll be here
waiting for you.

146
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,898
The safe will be open.

147
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,976
There will be
$50,000 in it.

148
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:43,743
You'll be wearing rubber gloves.
Do you own rubber gloves?

149
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:46,910
I rent 'em. I have
a lease with an option to buy.

150
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,945
Now in this drawer...

151
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:52,982
Ah!

152
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,526
A.357 Magnum.

153
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,960
My.357. You use it.

154
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,361
No one can trace it to you.

155
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,423
The room will be
in disarray.

156
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,934
Like a burglary attempt?

157
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:08,065
You come in and catch me
stealing your ties and money?

158
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:13,077
We scuffle. The gun
gets loose and I shoot you.

159
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:14,737
Precisely.

160
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,883
- Are you a good shot?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

161
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,409
Get me on the first shot,
if you can.

162
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,252
- Do you have a passport?
- Can dig one up.

163
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:29,693
Good. Now, after you kill me,
take the Jaguar.

164
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,287
The keys will be
in the glove compartment.

165
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,459
- Take it where?
- L.A.X.

166
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,798
Pan Am will have a ticket for you.

167
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,861
- Where am I going?
- Rio.

168
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,339
It departs at 11 p.m.

169
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,638
They serve dinner onboard?

170
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,803
And a movie and drinks.

171
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,371
Stay down there
for a year.

172
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,714
So?

173
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,012
So...

174
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,384
You certainly
thought this out.

175
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,985
I don't leave
a great deal to chance.

176
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,262
Those will be open?

177
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,859
Take care of the gloves,
the passport and the aim.

178
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,335
I'll handle
everything else.

179
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:15,340
The gun, the money,
the tickets...

180
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,841
and the dying.

181
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,900
Thas right.

182
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,277
Looks like you
get the hard part.

183
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,282
What do you say?

184
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,944
You'll be doing me
a great service.

185
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,515
Will you kill me?

186
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,489
Sure.

187
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,904
Hey! Good to see you.

188
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,470
Slouch,
how are you?

189
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,507
Can I steal you?

190
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,348
If you promise
not to return me.

191
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,354
- Magic today?
- Yeah, Kareem's in the wash.

192
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,049
I need a favor.

193
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,615
- Fletch!
- Did you hear something?

194
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:10,685
See what we have on Alan Stanwyk
in Beverly Hills.

195
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,560
I need this right away.

196
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,259
- I take it the story's done.
- W-Y-K.

197
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,325
Tell me I'm right.

198
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,394
You're right,
but you're very peaked.

199
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,032
Want to vomit?
Come on in.

200
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,440
- The story's done, right?
- Uh... almost.

201
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,341
Almost is not an answer.

202
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,539
Yes is an answer.

203
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,344
And a damn fine answer.

204
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,509
Professional journalism time now.

205
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,749
Go back and finish
the story!

206
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:39,689
Frank, I will.
I swear it.

207
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,124
Something came up.

208
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:43,320
You've got
a deadline tomorrow.

209
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,386
Did you see Sunday's ad?

210
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,456
I don't read the paper.
Whas the spread on tonighs game?

211
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,264
- Lakers by six.
- Take a look.

212
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,831
Shame of the City.
Thas very nice.

213
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,807
Try to follow this.

214
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,868
You can't run the ad
and then not run the story.

215
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,604
You can't? Why not?

216
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,406
Shit. Really?

217
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:10,387
I'm putting you on. You'll get
the story. You'll be proud of it.

218
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,822
You broke it?
You know the source?

219
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,189
Practically.

220
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,093
Is it Fat Sam?
You said you had pictures of him.

221
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:20,360
- I do have pictures of him dealing.
- Les go. We'll run them.

222
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:21,990
You can't do that.

223
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:25,230
Fat Sam isn't the story.
There's a source behind him.

224
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,204
Who?

225
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,900
Thas a gray area.

226
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,134
How gray?

227
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,370
Charcoal.

228
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,071
May I help you with that?

229
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:39,878
OK. A little lighter.

230
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,920
Can you go higher?

231
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,979
Over to the right.
Higher. Perfect.

232
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:48,083
Nice and hard.
Thas good. Thank you.

233
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,151
- That it?
- Perfect.

234
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,992
Everything's recent.

235
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:55,556
Let me see that. Alan Stanwyk,
commercial airline pilot...

236
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,568
from Provo, Utah."

237
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:00,537
Formerly a test pilot,
member of the Jaycees.

238
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,335
- Move on?
- Yeah.

239
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,243
Married Boyd Aviation.

240
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,370
He's no dummy.
Thas big bucks.

241
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:11,314
His parents are Marvin and Velma,
were unable to attend the wedding.

242
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:15,285
Those are three names I enjoy:
Marvin, Velma and Provo.

243
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,819
Hold it there.

244
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:22,122
Cancer.
Cancer Society Benefit.

245
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,630
Internist Dr. Joseph Dolan.

246
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,826
I wonder if
thas his doctor.

247
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,892
One way to find out.

248
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,665
There is.

249
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,499
Where do you
know Alan from?

250
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:38,475
We play tennis
at the club.

251
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,011
California Racquet Club?

252
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,604
- Right.
- Thas my club too.

253
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,580
I don't remember
seeing you there.

254
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:50,520
I haven't been playing
because of these kidney pains.

255
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:54,821
Right. How long have you
had these pains, Mr. Barber?

256
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,452
No, thas Babar.

257
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,055
Two B's?

258
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,862
One B.
B-A-B-A-R.

259
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:04,232
- Thas two.
- Yeah, but not together.

260
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,203
I thought
thas what you meant.

261
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,675
Arnold Babar.

262
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,677
Aren't there
children's books...

263
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,975
about an elephant
named Babar?

264
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:19,176
- I don't know. I don't have any.
- No children?

265
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,685
No, elephant books.

266
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,688
Open wide.

267
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,582
Say, Ah.

268
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,023
Aah.

269
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,995
Is an odd name.

270
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,963
I haven't seen it
on the club registry.

271
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:36,490
I don't formally belong.
I'm a guest of my auns.

272
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:37,933
Your aunt?

273
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,064
- Right. Mrs. Smith.
- Joan or Margaret?

274
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,573
Uh-huh.

275
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,040
Which one?

276
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,202
Margaret.

277
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,774
Funny old bird.

278
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:51,873
I could tell you
some stories.

279
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,441
I bet.

280
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,786
You know,
is a shame about Ed.

281
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:01,792
It was.
That was really a shame.

282
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,794
To go so suddenly.

283
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:06,023
He was dying
for years.

284
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:09,363
But the end
was very sudden.

285
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,261
He was in intensive care
for eight weeks.

286
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,330
But the very end,
when he actually died...

287
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,409
was extremely sudden.

288
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:23,073
Alan and I were recently
speaking of dying.

289
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,447
He told me Boyd Aviation took out
a large insurance policy on him.

290
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,778
You've got to be
in perfect shape...

291
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:32,585
to get that sort
of a policy, I bet.

292
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,149
Drop your shorts
and bend over, Mr. Babar.

293
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:38,253
No, really.
We don't need to.

294
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,594
We don't want
to do that.

295
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,926
My kidneys feel better
in this position.

296
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,904
Maybe is that I'm not doing
any calisthenics.

297
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:49,167
If I did sit-ups
or bent over like this...

298
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,209
I'd feel 100% bet...

299
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:54,473
# Moon River ##

00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:57,538
Whew! Thank you, Doc.
You ever serve time?

301
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,777
- Breathe easy.
- Breathe easy.

302
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,180
I was surprised Alan
got that policy.

303
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,451
There's a history of cancer
in the family.

304
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,652
- There is?
- Yeah.

305
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:12,219
As a matter of fact... Aah!
You using the whole fist?

306
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,764
Just relax.

307
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:18,666
I saw Alan the other day.
He was looking peaked.

308
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:21,205
Are you sure
he's all right?

309
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:24,265
I can't discuss another patient.
You know that.

310
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,874
Well, I don't find
anything wrong with you.

311
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:31,109
I'm sure is not
for a lack of looking.

312
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:35,009
12 noon.

313
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,487
I was anxious
to return to my drug story.

314
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,218
But since Dr. Jellyfinger
wasn't talking...

315
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:43,284
I had to find out
about Stanwyk's health.

316
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,200
May I help you, Dr., uh...

317
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,396
Dr. Rosenpenis. I'm here
to check Stanwyk's file.

318
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,665
Doctor who?

319
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,104
Dr. Rosenrosen.

320
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,108
Your name again.

321
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,871
Is Dr. Rosenhite.

322
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,571
Doctor who?

323
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,671
Dr. Rosen.
Where's the records room?

324
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,808
- Next to Pathology.
- Would you take care of these things?

325
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:09,342
I'd like to check
Alan Stanwyk's file.

326
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,288
Where the hell's
the records room?

327
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:14,587
Next to Pathology, B1.

328
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,493
Collate these for me.
Where did you say that was?

329
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,531
- B1.
- Thank you very much.

330
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,532
- Take the elevator.
- Thank you.

331
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:59,269
Give me a hand, Doctor.

332
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,169
Me?

333
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,867
Come on!

334
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,575
Yeah.

335
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,952
Have you ever seen a spleen
that large?

336
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:19,286
No, not since breakfast.

337
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:20,916
Here. Hold this.

338
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,224
I haven't sterilized
my hands.

339
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:27,459

And bring me the head
of Alfredo Garcia.

354
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,978
Dr. Holmes was
surprised you fainted.

355
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,110
He was surprised?

356
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:23,211
I thought that body
was my dead brother.

357
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,188
Oh!

358
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,157
That spleen was
the spitting image.

359
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,126
No, I'm fine.

360
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,858
Nurse, I'm hyperventilating.

361
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,924
Would you get me
a paper bag?

362
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,061
- Yes, right away.
- Thank you.

363
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,254
Here you are, Doctor.

364
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,721
Oh, thank you.

365
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,724
Can I help you?

366
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,783
No. Uh, yes, there is,
actually.

367
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,456
One of my associates
was doing a biopsy on this man.

368
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:46,300
They said he had a melanoma,
carcinoma... some kind of noma.

369
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,899
There's no record
of it here.

370
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,876
If he had one,
it would be in here.

371
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,071
Wait. Here it is.

372
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,139
Surgical removal
of two moles.

373
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:00,275
Tissue was benign."

374
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:04,285
Benign? There's no mention
of cancer? Thas it?

375
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:05,846
Thas it.

376
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,451
This is one month ago.

377
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:13,826
According to this hospital,
Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.

378
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,423
I guess not.

379
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,929
He'll be so relieved.

380
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:22,373
- Thank you very much.
- My pleasure.

381
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,432
Have a nice day.

382
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,639
[Bang]

383
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,532
I'm not finished.

384
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:56,801
- Sorry, Mr. Underhill.
- Do I look finished?

385
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,274
I guess not.

386
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:02,671
- Now I'm finished.
- Whatever you say.

387
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:13,022
You're expecting
a nice gratuity, right?

388
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,252
Maybe next time.

389
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:22,630
Gail Stanwyk?

390
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:25,033
Yeah.

391
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,968
I haven't seen you
since the wedding. You look great.

392
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,336
I do?
Thas sweet of you.

393
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,406
I musve been plowed
at your wedding.

394
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:36,344
I don't know you.

395
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,573
Not my wedding,
your wedding.

396
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:42,745
Oh, my wedding.
Thank God.

397
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:46,222
Doesn't really help me.
Are you a friend of Alan's?

398
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,418
Yes, we flew together.
I'm John.

399
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,427
Oh, John.

400
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:56,299
Oh, yes.

401
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:57,699
No. John who?

402
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,500
John Cocktoasttoy.

403
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:01,698
Beautiful name.

404
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,240
Is Scotch-Rumanian.

405
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:05,708
- An odd combination.
- So were my parents.

406
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:10,181
Do you mind if I
practice some more?

407
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:11,738
Go ahead.

408
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,819
You're a member
of the club, señor?

409
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:24,361
No. I'm with the Underhills.

410
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:25,987
They left, señor.

411
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:29,056
He'll be back
after his urinalysis.

412
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,193
Would you like some drinks?

413
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:33,328
I'll put it on
the Underhills' bill.

414
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:37,639
Yes. I'll have
a Bloody Mary...

415
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:40,473
a steak sandwich,
and a steak sandwich.

416
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,116
So how's Alan?

417
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:51,485
He's been so busy lately,
I hardly see him.

418
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:54,320
- He's been preoccupied.
- With what?

419
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:57,020
I don't know.
Personal stuff.

420
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:59,620
Whoa!
I hit one.

421
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:01,791
Lobs are important
in tennis.

422
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:02,959
Sorry, sir.

423
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:08,500
I'll show you
a couple things.

424
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:10,336
Stand here.

425
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:13,605
When the ball comes,
face it like this.

426
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,168
Yeah.

427
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:16,839
And then
pivot your body,

428
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:19,406
step in
with your left foot.

429
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:21,315
Just like this.

430
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:22,785
OK?

431
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,515
Go ahead. Try one.

432
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,079
All right.
Go ahead.

433
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,091
Get in position.

434
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,356
The ball's going to come.
Ready?

435
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:33,090
How many are
in the machine?

436
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:35,758
- A lot, I thought.
- Is finished.

437
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,631
Good.
Much better.

438
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,271
I must be having an off day.
I'm usually a fabulous player.

439
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,365
I affect women this way.

440
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:46,376
I bet you do.

441
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:50,073
I bumped into Alan
this morning.

442
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:52,139
You know what
I can't figure out?

443
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,844
Alan's in Utah.

444
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,650
I can't figure out what I was doing
in Utah this morning.

445
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:04,020
I'm very flattered,
but I'm also very married.

446
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,964
You're hitting
on me, aren't you?

447
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,295
How did you guess?

448
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,533
I'm such a heel.
Don't know what came over me.

449
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:17,701
If I had a nickel
for every one of Alan's flyboy
buddies who tried to pick me up...

450
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:19,175
I'd be rich.

451
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:21,074
You are rich.

452
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,875
See what I mean?

453
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,186
The vice president knew
I was opening the door...

454
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,983
but the Secret Service...

455
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:32,523
Whack!
And blood...

456
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:36,418
Washington.

457
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:38,257
Sugar, Mr. Poon?

458
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,491
No, never, never.
Thank you.

459
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,671
Well, now,
let me reiterate...

460
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,106
that this is not
a formal investigation.

461
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:55,408
If Alan Stanwyk isn't involved
in improprieties...

462
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,881
Alan Stanwyk is not involved
in any improprieties.

463
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,818
How can the S.E.C.
make such an accusation?

464
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:05,151
You know that,
and I know that...

465
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:08,522
but somebody's bucking
for a promotion.

466
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,720
Is probably that
pederast Hanrahan.

467
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,854
If I don't go back
with something...

468
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,297
you and your son-in-law
will be the scapegoats.

469
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:18,029
Unbelievable.
This is unbelievable.

470
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:21,038
They want to know
why he's in Utah.

471
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:24,598
Jesus H. Christ
on a Popsicle stick.

472
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:25,938
First of all...

473
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:29,344
Alan Stanwyk does not own
one single share of stock.

474
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,308
The $3 million
for the ranch in Provo...

475
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:34,545
was entirely provided
by my daughter...

476
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:39,955
who converted her personal,
non-corporate holdings.

477
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,022
So, if any
of your D.C. boys...

478
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:47,428
want to challenge that,
bring them on.

479
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:52,527
Otherwise, tell them
to get out of my face.

480
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,140
God, I admire you.

481
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,337
Well...

482
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:05,406
consider
this case closed.

483
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,682
It stopped bleeding.
Isn't that something?

484
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:13,189
My pleasure.

485
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:15,249
Thank you and good day.

486
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:16,657
By the way...

487
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,354
what kind
of a name is Poon?

488
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,698
Comanche Indian.
Good-bye.

489
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:28,372
Madeline, Frieda lost the number
for Alan's realtor in Provo, Utah.

490
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,998
Could you get me that?

491
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:32,134
- Jim Swarthout?
- Yeah.

492
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,780
- Who are you again?
- I'm Frieda's boss.

493
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:41,183
- Who's Frieda?
- My secretary.

494
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:47,283
I knew my junkie pals were awaiting
my good cheer on the beach...

495
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:50,350
but I needed a second wind,
a beer and a wardrobe change.

496
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,795
As I pulled up to
my imitation apartment building...

497
00:28:56,868 --> 00:29:01,601
I observed the Oldsmobuick
of Mr. Arnold T. Pants, Esquire...

498
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:04,733
attorney for the former
Mrs. Erwin Fletcher.

499
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,672
Time to use
the service entrance.

500
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:47,751
Refusal to pay alimony
is a jailable offense, Fletch.

501
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,790
What about trespassing
and loitering?

502
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:56,019
I am neither loitering
nor trespassing.

503
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:58,426
I've simply chosen
an advisable location...

504
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:01,021
to await my cliens
delinquent husband.

505
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:04,193
I prefer to discuss
business inside.

506
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,963
Leave your rubbers outside.

507
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,869
A little one-on-one?

508
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,982
He draws the foul.

509
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:25,951
You owe Wendy $918.

510
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:29,118
She doesn't need it. She's been
living with somebody for months.

511
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,219
I don't
what you're referring to.

512
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:33,161
Wendy maintains
her own residence.

513
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:34,664
This stinks.

514
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:38,099
I empathize, Fletch.
However, you threw her out.

515
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,228
She slept with everybody.

516
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:42,102
Prove that in court.

517
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,038
My lawyer was a bum.

518
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:45,405
I agree.

519
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:47,034
They slept together.

520
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:49,636
You may be right.

521
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,113
Are you serious?

522
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,649
Thas history, Fletch.

523
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:55,277
You owe us $918.

524
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,214
Hey!

525
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:03,727
I think our problems may just
be solved. Ed McMahon.

526
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:08,654
I think I
just won $1 million.

527
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:11,167
Erwin M. Fletcher,
you choose.

528
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,761
Whoo-ee! I lost. Sorry.

529
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:15,499
Is no joke, Fletch.

530
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:20,533
If some kind of payment isn't made,
I'll have to garnish your wages.

531
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:24,304
I can't have
my wages garnish-ied.

532
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,371
Tell you what.

533
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:28,850
Cash? I'm impressed.

534
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,911
I saw my pimp today.

535
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,221
Open your raincoat.

536
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,691
Come on. Just once.
Is worth it.

537
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:40,519
Thas $1,000.
Apply some towards next month.

538
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:42,589
- Now scram.
- Till then.

539
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,864
Keep 10 and get yourself
a nice piece of ass.

540
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:06,088
Our guest is
the most valuable player...

541
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:08,352
of the National
Basketball Association...

542
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,360
from the Los Angeles Lakers...

543
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,556
the all-time scoring champion
of the N.B.A., Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

544
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:16,566
He's coming off a game that was
second to none in his brilliant career.

545
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:17,999
You must be proud.

546
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:20,196
Definitely, Chick.
It was a great effort.

547
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:23,365
But I had a lot of help,
and we're just glad to be here.

548
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,341
How about Fletch?

549
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,573
What can I say about Fletch?
He's been fantastic.

550
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:31,444
He boxes out for us,
gets the tough rebounds...

551
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:33,677
and does what
we need to win.

552
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:36,914
Is great working with him. I don't
know where we'd be without him.

553
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:41,783
Les look at the play.
He's 6'5. With the Afro, 6'9.

554
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:45,659
Good dribbler. Comes in deep.
His club is behind by one point.

555
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,461
Fletch puts the ball through the legs.
What a great play!

556
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,968
He puts it in!
The Lakers have the lead!

557
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:56,097
Was that some play! This kid
from Harlem really creates excitement.

558
00:32:56,174 --> 00:33:00,508
$4 million a year,
but he earns every nickel.

559
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:04,674
Look how he shakes off
four or five defenders with ease.

560
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:08,344
Fletch... he truly defines
grace under pressure.

561
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:17,720
See if you've got anything on Stanwyk
from when he lived in Utah.

562
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:21,094
Yeah. And check out a realtor
in Provo named Swarthout.

563
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:29,564
Shit!

564
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,284
Whas going on?

565
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,183
Take off, Fletch!

566

What are you doing?

567
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:46,780
They're after
Gummy again.

568
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,656
Slow down.
This is dumb.

569
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,857
Come on, man!

570
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:58,458
He's defenseless.

571
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,735
Don't...

572
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:02,430
Get up!

573
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:04,532

00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:12,008
Let me out!

576
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:21,615
Beat it, cop!

577
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:25,018
Hey, you're really nuts.

You OK?

579
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,557
Yeah. I feel like $100.

580

- They didn't do anything.
- What are you talking about?

581
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:35,871
I busted their window.

582
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,840
You're lucky.

583
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,934
Is not luck.
They didn't want me.

584
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:43,469
They wanted Gummy.

585
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,876
The cops and Gummy...

586
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:59,160
Relax, Frank.
I need more time.

587
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,130
I could be onto something.

589
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:06,328

Don't point. Speak!

592
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,878
- I need Fletch.
- She needs me.

593
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,005

or Jim Swarthout.

594

on the back burner.

just a little hint?

All right, Frank.

598
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:30,527

- Whas this?

601
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:38,567
More cops. Frank,
I need to go to Utah.

603
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,198
Yeah, Utah. Is wedged in
between Wyoming and Nevada.

604
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:45,834
- What about finding the source?
- I have some ideas.

605
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:50,472
Say yes, Frank. I'll buy you
some new deodorant.

606
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:54,483

Question.

613
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:30,015
Why does a man
ask me to kill him...

614

when he isn't dying?

I overheard some people
talking at the club.

625

00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:03,658
it might get
some of my men killed.

704
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:06,396
I can't have that,
Mr. Fletch.

705
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:07,801
You understand?

706
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,202
Yeah.

707
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:10,763
I understand.

708
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,309
I got a deadline.

709
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:17,503
The name's Karlin
with a K?

710
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:19,446
You dipshit!

711
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:23,610
Go back to that beach,
you won't live to regret it!

712
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:25,314
All right?

713
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,388
Hey, you and
Tommy Lasorda.

714
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:30,984
- Yeah.
- I hate Tommy Lasorda.

715
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:40,000
Hey!

716
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:44,464
I'll take care of it now.

717
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:47,476
# Swing low,
sweet chariot #

718
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:49,978
I'll handle it from here.

719
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:53,676
# Comin' for
to carry me home ##

720
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,241
Can't keep me here.

721
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:57,719
Maybe I won't keep you.

722
00:45:57,788 --> 00:46:00,814
Maybe I'll blow
your brains out.

723
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:05,686
I do believe thas
a violation of my rights.

724
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:09,824
After I shoot you,
I stick myself with this knife...

725
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,993
and place it
in your dead hand.

726
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:14,367
Self-defense.

727
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:18,033
We don't do it anymore,
but back in the old days...

728
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:21,739
You're serious.

729
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:23,871
Ask anybody.

730
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:27,576
Can I ask anybody now?

731
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:29,710
Can I call my mom,
tell her I love her.

732
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,880
Uh... guess not.

733
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:46,429
I'm a newspaper reporter. You don't
blow away newspaper reporters.

734
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:48,494
Kinda stupid, isn't it?

735
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:50,301
What will it be, Fletch?

736
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:59,043
Hey, I hate the beach anyway.

737
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:01,107
Is not even my story.

738
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,246
I've got a deadline
on the off-track betting...

739
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,846
in the Himalayas.

740
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:09,415
Smaller story, but I know
you've been following it.

741
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:15,126
You have things
under control down there.

742
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,224
Your beach.

743
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:26,299
Come on out.
Come on.

744
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,776
May I? Thank you.

745
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,740
How could you call him?

746
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:31,075
Fletch, I'm sorry.

747
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:33,116
You know how close
to death I came?

748
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,014
Yeah, is awful.

749
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:39,453
He had a gun at my head
and a knife in his hand!

750
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,354
He threatened
to kill me.

751
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:43,586
Hey, thas a shame.

752
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,594
He woulïve shot me.

753
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:46,686
Unbelievable.

754
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,060
You don't believe me.

755
00:47:54,104 --> 00:47:55,594
Nope.

756
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,704
- He thinks I'm lying.
- Unbelievable.

757
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,005
I need an article
by tomorrow.

758
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:03,012
- You believe me.
- Yes, I do.

759
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,981
I don't want unsubstantiated charges
about dope-dealing cops...

760
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:10,543
or paranoid fantasies
about homicidal police chiefs.

761
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:12,714
Give me something
I can print!

762
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,316
Print this.

763
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:19,895
Me, too.

764
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:23,524
Hey, watch it.
You're on thin ice, Larry.

765
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:34,169
It was time to hang out
at Boyd Aviation...

766
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:37,736
to find out what Stanwyk
was doing with that plane.

767
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:39,577
I splurged.

768
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:42,642
I invested 49 cents
on some novelty teeth.

769
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:54,955
Hey!

770
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:57,933
- You the guy from Ajax?
- Yeah, you bet.

771
00:48:58,001 --> 00:48:59,059
All right.

772
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:01,127
- Thought you were bringing the eight?
- They're coming.

773
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:04,935
I'm the supervisor.
I don't carry the stuff.

774
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:06,908
Freddie's bringing them?

775
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:08,444
Yeah. Freddie.

776
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:11,913
You were supposed to be here
an hour ago.

777
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:14,382
Traffic was murder.

778
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:18,410
A manure spreader
jackknifed on the Santa Ana.

779
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:20,422
God-awful mess.

780
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:22,890
You should see my shoes.

781
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,894
Whew!

782
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:29,131
Stanwyk's baby, huh?

783
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:30,860
Yeah.

784
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:32,526
Uh-huh.

785
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:39,632
Looks well-used.

786
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:41,735
Travels to Utah every weekend.

787
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,609
Is that right?

788
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,375
Is he a Mormon?

789
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:50,284
I don't think he's doing
a lot of singing...

790
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:52,549
with the Tabernacle Choir.

791
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:55,455
These executives live high.
Know what I mean?

792
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:57,015
I sure do.

793
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:08,769
Thas a terrific wing.
I love this shape.

794
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:13,272
Do us a favor, pal.

795
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,072
Name's Liddy.
Gordon Liddy.

796
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:18,046
Take a look
at the seventh Fetzer valve.

797
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:19,582
Is been sticking.

798
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:22,779
Probably the humidity.

799
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:25,486
Thas funny.

800
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:29,013
I think is
the by-pass line.

801
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:33,629
It could be the by-pass line.
I should look at it.

802
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:39,791
Uh, Gordo?

803
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:42,327
Back here?

804
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:45,737
Don't tell me
my business, boy!

805
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:48,539
Just checking the luggage.

806
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:52,309
Somebody should clean these windows.
There's gook all over 'em.

807
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,111
Look at that.

808
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:57,276
You use a lot of fuel
to go to Utah?

809
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:58,946
I ask that, too.

810
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:01,616
Burns enough to go
to South America and back.

811
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:03,716
South America and back.

812
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:06,987
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

813
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,123
I always kid him.
I say:

814
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:12,566
You doing some stunt flying
up there or something?

815
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:15,528
Whas he say?

816
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:18,904
Nothing.
He just gives me that look.

817
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:21,136
You know,
he's got that look.

818
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:23,679
Yeah, he just gives him
that look.

819
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,647
Sure.
He's the boss.

820
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:28,946
Let me look
at this Fetzer.

821
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:33,012
Uh, Gord.

822
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,617
I know. I'm getting
a birïs-eye view.

823
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:38,752
Oh, ho ho.

824
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:40,990
Is the by-pass line, right?

825
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:43,123
I think so. Yeah.

826
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,191
Told ya.

827
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:47,429
I'll need some pliers...

828
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:50,064
and a set of 30-weight
ball bearings.

829
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,301
- What?
- Yeah.

830
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:54,900
Tell ya what.
I gotta go to my truck.

831
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:57,947
If Fred gets here before I'm back,
tell him to start without me.

832
00:51:58,014 --> 00:52:01,040
Why do you need
ball bearings?

833
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,517
Come on, guys.

834
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:05,316
Maybe you need
a refresher course.

835
00:52:05,388 --> 00:52:08,380
Hey, is all
ball bearings nowadays.

836
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:14,357
Prepare that valve
with 3-in-1 oil...

837
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:16,490
and gauze pads.

838
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:18,796
And I'll need 10 quarts
of antifreeze...

839
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:20,803
preferably Prestone.

840
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:23,840
No, make that
Quaker State.

841
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,671
And wash those windows.
They got muck on 'em.

842
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:29,173
Buenos días, señor.

843
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:31,009
Hi. Where's
Mrs. Stanwyk?

844
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:32,480
In her cabana.

845
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:34,881
I'm supposed to meet her.
Cabana six?

846
00:52:34,951 --> 00:52:38,079
Cabana one. You would like
something to eat or drink?

847
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:39,622
Actually, I would.

848
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:41,680
Charge it
to the Underhills?

849
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:43,885
Right.
Do you have any caviar?

850
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,656
Sí, señor. Beluga.
But it is $80 a portion.

851
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:48,994
I better just take
two portions.

852
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:50,999
How's the Lobster Thermidor?

853
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:53,433
- I recommend it.
- Good. Thall be fine.

854
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,494
Bring two bottles
of Dom Perignon.

855
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:57,005
Very good, señor.

856
00:52:57,073 --> 00:53:00,099
- Put down $30 for yourself.
- Muchas gracias, señor.

857
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:12,554
Who is it?

858
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:14,522
Is John.

859
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:16,058
John who?

860
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:19,186
Is John.
John Levin... I don't remember.

861
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:20,786
John Cocktoastin?

862
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:23,690
Hi.

863
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:27,033
Hi.

864
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:30,129
I was hoping
you'd say that.

865
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:33,402
I just got out of the shower.

866
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:35,603
Yeah.
Can I borrow your towel?

867
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:38,045
My car hit
a water buffalo.

868
00:53:39,149 --> 00:53:40,741
Nice place.

869
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:45,379
I'm surprised to see you.
What are you doing here?

870
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:47,355
I ordered some lunch.

871
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:48,618
For here?

872
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:50,887
I knew this is where
my mouth would be.

873
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:54,925
I really should change.

874
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:57,967
No, you should stay
the wonderful person you are today.

875
00:53:58,034 --> 00:53:59,831
I mean put clothes on.

876
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:02,497
Make yourself comfortable.

877
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,563
Are you always
this forward?

878
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:07,405
Only with
wet married women.

879
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:08,944
[Knock At Door]

880
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:10,673
Get the door!

881
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:19,849
Ah. Very good, gentlemen.
Come right in.

882
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,515
Right in this way.

883
00:54:23,226 --> 00:54:24,659
Right in here.

884
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:27,288
Thas good.
Thas very nice.

885
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:28,592
Want I set up?

886
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:31,896
No, I'll take care of it.
Give each other $20.

887
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:34,732
- Put it on Underhill.
- Muchas gracias.

888

Sierra del fuego.

889
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:41,577
Oh, this is beautiful.

890
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:43,636
There we have it.

891
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:47,583
This goes
on the Underhills' bill?

892
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:50,119
I saved his life
during the war.

893
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:53,121
- You were in the war?
- No, he was. I got him out.

894
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:54,850
Oh.

895
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:57,119
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

896
00:54:57,193 --> 00:54:58,626
This is great.

897

Les eat.

898
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:03,490
- Your bill, señor.
- Oh, thank you.

899
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:07,961
- $400 for lunch?
- Your guest, señor.

900
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:11,405
We didn't have
any guests today.

901
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:14,238
Two bottles of Dom Perignon?
$100 a pop!

902
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:17,439
- Jesus H. Christ! Where is he?
- With Ms. Stanwyk.

903
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:19,345
- Where's she?
- Cabana one.

904
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,473
Can I ask you a question?

905
00:55:21,551 --> 00:55:23,678
- Depends on the question.
- More champagne?

906
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:26,153
- Yes.
- Are you still in love with Alan?

907
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:29,885
No. I mean, no, you can't
ask me that question.

908
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:33,053
- Ask me another one.
- Why'd you let me in?

909
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:36,759
Um, because I'm bored.

910
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:40,369
If you're bored, why didn't you
go to Utah with Alan?

911
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:44,066
Utah's not exactly
a cure for boredom.

912
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:45,607
Good point.

913
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,508
I've never been there.
I shouldn't say that.

914
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:50,102
What about his parents?

915
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,944
He hasn't seen them for years.
I've never met them.

916
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,881
They don't get along?

I'm sorry to disturb you.
Is Ted Underhill.

920
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,691
Thanks for a great time.
l... Whew! ...gotta go.

921
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:09,595
Wait a minute.
What is this?

922
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:11,361
Someone of
your acquaintance...

923
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:13,994
has charged a $400 lunch
to my account.

924
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:16,061
You don't know
the Underhills?

925
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:18,972
I'd like to discuss this matter
with you.

926
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,873
I'm just out of the shower.

927
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:22,935
- Wait a minute.
- I have to wee-wee.

928
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:24,570
Yes, of course.

929
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:30,250
- Why did you do it?
- You shouldn't have to pay the bill.

930
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,515
A $400 lunch tab?

931
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:35,057
Is outrageous.
Is way over the line.

932
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:37,992
I'll cover it. You can't
go out looking like that.

933
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,086
He might spot you.
Hold on.

934
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:43,826
You look like you're the same size
as Alan. Put this on.

935
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,095
- Nice suit.
- Just return it.

936
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:50,200
Any other surprises?

937
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:52,873
Yeah.

My name is not
John Cocktoastin.

939
00:56:57,046 --> 00:57:00,675
- I wasn't at your wedding.
- Who are you?

940
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,411
I'm Erwin Fletcher.

941

00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:09,324
So...

944
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:14,022
your husband
hired me to kill him.

945

946
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:20,427
- Mrs. Stanwyk!
- In a minute!

947
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,703
Enough surprises.
What are you talking about?

948
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,366
Sit down.

949
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:32,408
Your husband told me he was dying
of cancer. Is that true?

950
00:57:32,482 --> 00:57:34,609
Is not true.

951
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:38,484
That property you thought
you were buying in Utah? Not true.

952
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:42,055
He's a bad guy.

953
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,457
He's involved in something
very big and very bad.

954
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:46,222
Do you know Jim Swarthout?

955
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,821
Yeah. He's the man
who sold us the ranch.

956
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:52,891
Wrong. He sold you
$3,000 worth of scrub brush.

957
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,698
I saw the deed.

958
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:57,365
You saw a forgery.

959
00:57:59,075 --> 00:58:01,407
This is the real deed.

960
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,173
There's Swarthous name.

961
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:05,646
If this were legible,
you'd see what I meant.

962
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:09,242
This dog tried to bite me.

Stop it. Stop.

966
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:17,650
He's told me a lot of things.

967
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:20,924
So far, not one has been true.

968
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,965
I'm sorry to have to
tell you these things.

969
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:25,159
- Mrs. Stanwyk!
- Just wait a minute!

970
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:29,464
- I'll call my father. He'll know.
- No, you can't.

971
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:33,532
I know you don't know me,
but you've gotta trust me.

972
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:37,774
Give me 24 hours.

973
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,781
Mrs. Stanwyk!

974
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:44,079

975
00:58:45,121 --> 00:58:47,589
No.

976
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:50,057
- Just a minute!
- I'll take you to a game.

977
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:52,458

978
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:57,396
Sorry. Thanks. Bye.

979
00:58:57,467 --> 00:59:01,836
- What are you talking about?
- I'd like to take you to a Laker game.

980
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:05,637
- If you need me, call the paper.
- What do I do for 24 hours?

981
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:08,768
- Act natural.
- I was afraid you'd say that.

- No, sir.
- Well, les check it out.

Keep out the ozone.

for car theft?

1003
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:57,595
- Why, did you steal the car?
- I sure did!

1004
01:02:57,673 --> 01:03:00,665
I'm not even sure
thas a crime anymore.

01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:36,849
Thank God he stopped it
in its tracks.

1052
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:40,756
It takes a lot for a man...

1053
01:06:42,031 --> 01:06:45,194
to admit where he got it from
and how he got it.

1054
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:48,100
Look at him today.
Fred, you look just wonderful.

1055
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:51,503
The nose looks normal again.
The face has come back into shape.

1056
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:54,168
Is not drooling anymore.

1057
01:06:54,243 --> 01:06:57,838
And hats off to Marge, his wife,
because that whole experience...

1058
01:06:57,913 --> 01:07:01,349
the three weeks that she stayed
at Trembling Hills has paid off.

1059
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:04,682
No more alcohol
or sedatives in her life.

1060
01:07:04,754 --> 01:07:07,484
There are many other things
I wanna tell you about Fred...

1061
01:07:07,556 --> 01:07:11,117
things that maybe many of you
already know.

1062
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:14,492
Sammy, you're not going
to sing for us, are you?

1063
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:18,693
Did you know that Fred
spent much of his life...

1064
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:23,296
honoring a profession that has gone
largely unsung around here?

1065
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:27,206
Some of them are here tonight.
The profession is law enforcement.

1066
01:07:27,276 --> 01:07:31,269
I know Fred feels that too often
our feelings are locked in...

1067
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:33,815
and we feel restrained
and perhaps even embarrassed...

1068
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:36,443
to reach out and touch
an officer of the law.

1069
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:39,113
After all, they are people,
aren't they?

1070
01:07:39,188 --> 01:07:42,919
Stand up. Pat them on the back.
Reach out.

1071
01:07:42,992 --> 01:07:46,450
Shake hands with any one
of these men in blue.

1072
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:48,997
Hug a cop!
Yeah, go ahead. I said it.

1073
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,794
Yeah!
Thas a wonderful feeling!

1074
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:52,857
I'm so proud tonight!

1075
01:07:52,935 --> 01:07:57,668
# Oh, say can you see #

1076
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:03,269
# By the dawn's
early light #

1077
01:08:03,345 --> 01:08:07,748
# What so proudly we hail #

1078
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:10,183
# At the twilighs
last gleaming ##

1079
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:11,981
Hip, hip, hooray!

1080
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:13,919
Hooray!
Hooray!

1081
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:15,320
Hooray!
Hooray!

1082
01:08:23,999 --> 01:08:26,331
Mr. Stanwyk,
you are confirmed on Flight 441...

1083
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:29,633
to Rio de Janeiro tomorrow evening,
11 p.m., first class.

1084
01:08:29,705 --> 01:08:31,935
Thas terrific.
Thank you.

1085
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:34,532
- You reconfirmed this morning.
- You bet I did.

1086
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:36,601
I'm a bear for detail.

1087
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:38,943
I hope there's nobody
sitting next to me.

1088
01:08:39,014 --> 01:08:42,814
I always travel first class,
and I take both seats up.

1089
01:08:42,885 --> 01:08:45,786
I'm in bridge work.
Bridge construction.

1090
01:08:45,855 --> 01:08:49,291
These fold-outs
take a lot of space.

1091
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:51,223
There is someone
next to you.

1092
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:55,992
Oh, for God don don!
Who is it? Mr. Singleton?

1093
01:08:57,333 --> 01:09:00,894
- No. The name is Cavanaugh.
- Cavanaugh?

1094
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,369
Ah! Morris or Pierre?

1095
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:05,966
Sally Ann Cavanaugh.

1096
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:08,168
Sally Ann?
Well, terrific.

1097
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:11,077
In fact, you purchased
the ticket for Miss Cavanaugh.

1098
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:13,945
Doesn't mean I want her
sitting next to me.

1099
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:18,584
The flighs full.
She's connecting out of Provo.

1100
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:21,815
Oh. All right, fine.

1101
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:24,018
Provo, Spain?

1102
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:25,754
Utah.

1103
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:26,988
Utah.

1104
01:09:27,062 --> 01:09:30,828
Frank, don't give me crap
about the beach story.

1105
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,664
- I'm at the airport.
- [Frank] The airport?

1106
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:36,000
There are two dozen cops
after my ass.

1107
01:09:36,071 --> 01:09:39,632
I can't go home or to the office.
I'm a man without a country.

1108
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:43,439
If cops are really after you,
come in here. You'll be OK.

1109
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:46,515
I couldn't
get through the front door.

1110
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:48,277
I'm going to Utah.

1111
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,818
You go to Utah,
you stay in Utah.

1112
01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:54,287
I'm turning the story over
to a professional reporter.

1113
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:57,018
The story is Utah.
Trust me.

1114
01:09:57,092 --> 01:10:00,118
You're going to Utah?
Fine.

1115
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:03,222
If you're story is not on my desk
by 11:30, you're fired.

1116
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:33,986
Cujo?

1117
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:50,396
Who the hell are you?

1118
01:12:50,466 --> 01:12:52,093
Get up!

1119
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:53,759
I'm up.

1120
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:57,869
- Door was unlocked.
- Lock's busted.

1121
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:59,271
There you have it.

1122
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:02,943
I work for the landlord.

1123
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:05,741
He told me to watch out
for the place.

1124
01:13:05,848 --> 01:13:08,715
- I commend him on his choice.
- What?

1125
01:13:08,784 --> 01:13:10,684
I commend him
on his choice.

1126
01:13:13,422 --> 01:13:15,481
I was supposed to meet
Mrs. Cavanaugh here.

1127
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:16,717
Who are you?

1128
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:20,284
I'm Don Corleone,
Mrs. Cavanaugh's cousin.

1129
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:22,387
You know where she is?

1130
01:13:22,464 --> 01:13:23,863
Moved out.

1131
01:13:23,932 --> 01:13:28,028
Moved out?
Isn't that something.

1132
01:13:28,103 --> 01:13:31,072
I talked to her last week.
She didn't say a thing about it.

1133
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:33,404
- She moved out.
- You're saying she moved out.

1134
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:36,808
- This morning.
- This morning?

1135
01:13:36,879 --> 01:13:40,280
God! Uh. We had
so much to talk about.

1136
01:13:41,717 --> 01:13:43,708
Mo Green is out
of the Tropicana.

1137
01:13:43,786 --> 01:13:46,254
My sons, Mike and Fredo,
are taking over.

1138
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:49,347
What did you
want under the bed?

1139
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:56,294
I have to pull rank on you.
I didn't want to have to do this.

1140
01:13:56,365 --> 01:14:00,358
I'm with the mattress police.
There are no tags on these mattresses.

1141
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:04,504
I'm taking you downtown.
Give me the weapon.

1142
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:07,936
I'm calling the cops.

1143
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:11,605
- This is for the cops.
- Come on, man. I'm her cousin.

1144
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,045
Tell the cops.

1145
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:20,481
OK. You wanna call the cops,
call the cops.

1146
01:14:21,657 --> 01:14:23,955
Better tie
your shoelaces first.

1147
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:47,370
Thanks a lot!

1148
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:57,892
Stretch, whas happening?

1149
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,793
- Got an unbelievable story here.
- Yeah? Great.

1150
01:15:00,863 --> 01:15:03,297
- What can I do?
- Write this down. Sally Ann Cavanaugh.

1151
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:05,333
Sally Ann Cavanaugh.

1152
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:08,267
Check every hotel in L.A.
Start near the airport.

1153
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,567
He's supposed to leave the country
with her tomorrow night.

1154
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:12,197
Got that, honey?

1155
01:15:12,274 --> 01:15:14,333
I love your body, Larry.

1156
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:18,607
[Pigs Grunting, Squealing]

1157
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,591
Good afternoon.

1158
01:15:33,662 --> 01:15:35,562
Howdy.

1159
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:37,656
They should
recall these things.

1160
01:15:37,733 --> 01:15:41,328
Hit one bump
and the window explodes.

1161
01:15:41,403 --> 01:15:42,961
You're Marvin Stanwyk?

1162
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:44,505
- Yeah.
- Hi there.

1163
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:47,201
Harry S. Truman,
Casewell Insurance underwriters.

1164
01:15:47,276 --> 01:15:48,709
Harry S. Truman?

1165
01:15:48,777 --> 01:15:51,940
My parents were fans
of the former president.

1166
01:15:52,014 --> 01:15:54,676
Isn't that nice.
He was a good man.

1167
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:57,150
- He sure was.
- He showed the Japs a thing or two.

1168
01:15:57,219 --> 01:16:00,245
- Dropped the big one, huh?
- He dropped two big ones on them.

1169
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:02,381
- He was a real fighter.
- Yeah.

1170
01:16:02,457 --> 01:16:05,187
You're in insurance, Harry?

1171
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:06,921
Thas right.

1172
01:16:06,995 --> 01:16:10,522
- Well, I'm fully covered.
- I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk.

1173
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:14,160
Actually, my company
sub-insures a policy...

1174
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:17,672
held by Alan Stanwyk,
who I believe is your son.

1175
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:19,104
Yeah, he is.

1176
01:16:19,174 --> 01:16:21,665
Mr. Truman,
meet my wife Velma.

1177
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:23,574
- My pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

1178
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:26,409
Sit down and have
a glass of lemonade.

1179
01:16:26,481 --> 01:16:29,917
- Thank you.
- Velma makes the most unusual lemonade.

1180
01:16:29,985 --> 01:16:33,182
Is hard to keep it cold
on a day like this.

1181
01:16:35,157 --> 01:16:37,125
Where you from, Harry?

1182
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,387
I'm from California.

1183
01:16:40,462 --> 01:16:42,396
San Berdoo.

1184
01:16:42,464 --> 01:16:45,331
Yeah. Utah is
part of my route.

1185
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:51,138
You folks don't mind if I ask you
a couple of questions, do you?

1186
01:16:51,206 --> 01:16:53,640
- Shoot.
- Thank you very much.

1187
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:56,200
We'll start with
some routine things.

1188
01:16:57,846 --> 01:17:00,679
You and your wife
are currently alive, I take it?

1189
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:04,710
- Harry, if there's...
- Is just regulations.

1190
01:17:06,355 --> 01:17:10,485
Now, you, Marvin,
and your wife named Velma...

1191
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:15,462
are the parents of one Alan Stanwyk
of Beverly Hills...

1192
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:17,725
Executive Vice President
of Boyd Aviation.

1193
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:19,664
- [Marvin] Check.
- Check.

1194
01:17:19,735 --> 01:17:21,828
And when did you last see Alan?

1195
01:17:23,205 --> 01:17:25,139
Oh... uh...

1196
01:17:25,207 --> 01:17:26,731
about 10 days ago.

1197
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:28,241
10 days ago?

1198
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:31,871
He comes and visits
about every three weeks.

1199
01:17:33,582 --> 01:17:36,915
Isn't that nice.
How long has he done that?

1200
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:38,680
Since he moved to L.A.

1201
01:17:43,225 --> 01:17:48,891
Pardon me if I seem a bit personal here.
I don't know how to put it.

1202
01:17:48,964 --> 01:17:54,231
We understand that there's
a young lady friend in Provo...

1203
01:17:54,302 --> 01:17:56,099
that Alan's been seeing.

1204
01:17:56,171 --> 01:17:58,230
Whas this got to do
with insurance?

1205
01:17:58,306 --> 01:18:00,740
This is a comprehensive policy.

1206
01:18:00,809 --> 01:18:03,209
Forget about
that lady friend business.

1207
01:18:03,278 --> 01:18:06,042
Alan is
a loving husband.

1208
01:18:06,114 --> 01:18:08,105
He dotes on his bride.

1209
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:09,616
Who?

1210
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,380
His wife.

1211
01:18:12,721 --> 01:18:15,189
You've met her?

1212
01:18:15,257 --> 01:18:17,851
Of course we have.
He brings her with him.

1213
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:25,127
Has Alan ever mentioned
the name Sally Ann Cavanaugh?

1214
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:27,729
Has he?

1215
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:34,073
Boy, what in the hell's
the matter with you?

1216
01:18:34,142 --> 01:18:36,406
- He has.
- Of course he has.

1217
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:37,809
Thas his wife.

1218
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:41,072
Of course.

1219
01:18:41,149 --> 01:18:43,743
His wife's name
is Sally Ann Cavanaugh.

1220
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:46,845
Cute as a button.

1221
01:18:46,922 --> 01:18:49,891
You wouldn't have
a picture of them, would you?

1222
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:52,119
We've got lots of pictures.

1223
01:18:52,194 --> 01:18:54,321
- Let me get you some.
- Great.

1224
01:18:56,298 --> 01:18:58,357
Still married are they,
Alan and Sally Ann?

1225
01:18:58,433 --> 01:18:59,798
Yes, they are.

1226
01:18:59,868 --> 01:19:01,927
How long have
they been married?

1227
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:05,962
It was before
he moved to L.A.

1228
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:08,032
Eight years April.

1229
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:10,237
This gets heavier
each year.

1230
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:13,770
There we are.
Here it is.

1231
01:19:13,849 --> 01:19:16,113
- Thas the one.
- Oh, my goodness.

1232
01:19:16,184 --> 01:19:18,482
She is a button,
isn't she?

1233
01:19:18,553 --> 01:19:20,111
Isn't she cute?

1234
01:19:20,188 --> 01:19:23,749
Could I borrow this picture?
I promise to send it back.

1235
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:27,727
- Is routine. The actuarial people...
- Thas all right. We have more.

1236
01:19:27,796 --> 01:19:30,890
- Want to see the reception?
- No, thank you. I'm trying to quit.

1237
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:33,025
How about Marvin's
65th birthday party?

1238
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:36,195
- How about that, Marvin?
- They got a picture of me in here.

1239
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:41,202
This is Alan?
I can't believe this!

1240
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:43,642
Is really Alan,
and is really bigamy.

1241
01:19:43,712 --> 01:19:46,772
- How long have they been married?
- About eight years.

1242
01:19:46,882 --> 01:19:47,974
Who is this woman?

1243
01:19:48,049 --> 01:19:51,678
I think is Alan's
high school sweetheart.

1244
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:54,619
Sally Ann something or other.

1245
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:58,893
Alan's been keeping
many secrets lately.

1246
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,552
I'm calling the police.

1247
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:02,119
No, Gail, don't.

1248
01:20:02,197 --> 01:20:05,462
- I'm calling my father.
- Give me one more day.

1249
01:20:05,534 --> 01:20:09,368
Why? Do you have any idea
how humiliating this is?

1250
01:20:09,437 --> 01:20:11,564
Yes, I do.
I really do.

1251
01:20:14,209 --> 01:20:17,474
Remember what I told you?
Tomorrow night you have a club meeting.

1252
01:20:17,546 --> 01:20:20,515
Stay away from the house.
I'll take care of him.

1253
01:20:20,582 --> 01:20:22,641
- Don't worry.
- She looks like a hooker.

1254
01:20:22,717 --> 01:20:26,016
Look at her. Could you love
someone who looked like that?

1255
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:28,078
What are you talking about?
Of course not.

1256
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:32,356
5, 10 minutes tops,
maybe.

1257
01:20:33,762 --> 01:20:35,252
Is funny.

1258
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:38,227
I know. Listen.

1259
01:20:39,301 --> 01:20:44,102
Why don't we relax and lie down
and I'll fill you in.

1260
01:20:47,042 --> 01:20:50,569
This is a good time
to make a pass at me.

1261
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:23,477
- Gum?
- Who? Go somewhere else.

1262
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:25,604
Gum, is me.

1263
01:21:26,948 --> 01:21:30,247
- Fletch. Really, is that you?
- Shut up. Don't say my name.

1264
01:21:30,318 --> 01:21:33,310
Shut up. Don't look at me.
I gotta talk to you.

1265
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:35,583
All right. About what?

1266
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:39,725
There are cops all around here.
They're after me.

1267
01:21:39,794 --> 01:21:42,922
- You mean those surfers over there?
- Lay back down.

1268
01:21:42,998 --> 01:21:45,728
- Don't point. Just lay back.
- OK.

1269
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:49,201
- Why they after you?
- I'm a newspaper reporter.

1270
01:21:49,271 --> 01:21:52,138
I'm nailing Chief Karlin as
the major drug source on this beach.

1271
01:21:54,809 --> 01:21:56,834
Sit back.

1272
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:00,939
Fat Sam's turning
State's evidence.

1273
01:22:01,016 --> 01:22:02,506
Whas that?

1274
01:22:03,618 --> 01:22:05,609
He wrote me
a nice deposition.

1275
01:22:05,687 --> 01:22:07,678
Said he received the drugs
and you did the selling.

1276
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:11,248
He said what?
Fletch, he's lying.

1277
01:22:11,326 --> 01:22:14,386
I didn't sell nothing.
You gotta believe me.

1278
01:22:14,462 --> 01:22:17,454
I just carried the drugs
from the chief to Sam.

1279
01:22:17,532 --> 01:22:20,968
- Sure you did, Gum.
- Honest, man. Thas all I did.

1280
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:25,666
20 years in prison, Gum.
Unless you want to play ball.

1281
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:31,602
You don't leave me
much choice.

1282
01:22:35,984 --> 01:22:37,975
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1283
01:22:38,053 --> 01:22:41,511
These robes...
I got another question.

1284
01:22:41,589 --> 01:22:44,251
Where does the chief
get his drugs?

1285
01:22:44,326 --> 01:22:45,657
I don't know.

1286
01:22:47,429 --> 01:22:49,954
Have fun.
Don't bend over for the soap.

1287
01:22:50,031 --> 01:22:51,464
Fletch.
Fletch, OK.

1288
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:55,960
Is somewhere
in South America.

1289
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:02,943
Mind if I sit here?

1290
01:23:03,011 --> 01:23:04,410
Fletch?

1291
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:06,071
Man...
[Laughing]

1292
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:08,980
- You don't know me, Sam.
- My pleasure, brother.

1293
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:10,915
I'm a reporter, Sam.

1294
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:14,478
I'm breaking the story
on the drug traffic around here.

1295
01:23:14,556 --> 01:23:16,251
Gummy's turning
State's evidence.

1296
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:18,690
I got good proof
is the chief.

1297
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,751
You gonna bust the chief?

1298
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:22,592
Gonna bust the chief.

1299
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:26,757
I could use your help.

1300
01:23:29,604 --> 01:23:32,596
I'm a slave to that
son of a bitch.

1301
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:34,904
He busted me,
third offense.

1302
01:23:34,976 --> 01:23:39,538
Said push for him or do 15 long.
All I get from this is free junk.

1303
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:42,344
- You don't have a piece of the action?
- No. Free junk, thas it.

1304
01:23:48,156 --> 01:23:49,851
Hey, how you doing?

1305
01:23:49,924 --> 01:23:53,087
Albert Einstein's forehead.
You like it? Won it in a raffle.

1306
01:23:53,161 --> 01:23:55,391
Fellas, stay with me.

1307
01:23:55,463 --> 01:23:57,556
Fletch?

1308
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,065
Whas up?

1309
01:24:00,135 --> 01:24:02,296
- I'm quitting at midnight.
- Who are they?

1310
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:05,339
This is Fat Sam and Gummy.
Come with me.

1311
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:07,398
Their statements
name Chief Karlin...

1312
01:24:07,475 --> 01:24:10,103
as the number one drug pusher
from here to Oxnard.

1313
01:24:10,178 --> 01:24:12,976
I want them to have Federal protection
sponsored by the paper. OK?

1314
01:24:17,285 --> 01:24:19,879
- This is wonderful.
- I'm out, Frank.

1315
01:24:19,954 --> 01:24:23,014
- You lost faith in me.
- Fletch, I got nervous.

1316
01:24:23,091 --> 01:24:25,286
Forget it.
I'm writing the story.

1317
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,726
Hold the last two paragraphs
till 10:00.

1318
01:24:27,796 --> 01:24:30,264
You want an apology?

1319
01:24:30,331 --> 01:24:32,925
- You were going to can me, right?
- No, not really.

1320
01:24:33,001 --> 01:24:36,459
- Not really?
- I was upset. You know.

1321
01:24:39,274 --> 01:24:42,471
OK. Jesus,
I'm sick of this place.

1322
01:24:42,544 --> 01:24:43,636
Ow.

1323
01:24:43,711 --> 01:24:47,408
I'll try out for the Lakers.
They need a power forward.

1324
01:24:47,482 --> 01:24:50,246
This is a hell of a story.

1325
01:24:50,318 --> 01:24:51,342
Thanks.

1326
01:24:51,419 --> 01:24:53,580
- About these guys...
- They're fine.

1327
01:24:53,655 --> 01:24:56,783
You don't have valuables
in there, do you?

1328
01:27:13,761 --> 01:27:15,285
Good evening.

1329
01:27:21,736 --> 01:27:24,330
I like your outfit.

1330
01:27:24,405 --> 01:27:26,396
Did you bring the 50 grand
and the tickets?

1331
01:27:26,474 --> 01:27:28,408
Of course.

1332
01:27:28,476 --> 01:27:31,673
Oh, oh, oh. You forgot
your rubber gloves.

1333
01:27:31,746 --> 01:27:34,237
You're planning
on killing me, aren't you?

1334
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:39,145
You catch on real quick,
Mr. Nugent.

1335
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:41,347
Thas a hostile thing to do.

1336
01:27:41,422 --> 01:27:45,552
You were gonna kill me.
I look at this as self-defense.

1337
01:27:45,627 --> 01:27:49,654
Now, if you would be so kind
as to put your passport on my desk.

1338
01:27:53,701 --> 01:27:56,363
You're wearing my suit.
Where did you get that?

1339
01:27:57,772 --> 01:28:00,764
Where did you get my suit,
Mr. Nugent?

1340
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:03,640
The name's Fletcher.
I'm a newspaper reporter.

1341
01:28:03,711 --> 01:28:05,804
I write a column
under the name Jane Doe.

1342
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:09,372
- What is this?
- Read this.

1343
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:12,078
- I don't have time...
- Cut the crap.

1344
01:28:12,153 --> 01:28:14,144
Come read this.
I'm not going anywhere.

1345
01:28:27,602 --> 01:28:30,537
Unless my people hear differently,
that letter goes out at midnight.

1346
01:28:39,514 --> 01:28:40,981
Dear Mr. Boyd:

1347
01:28:41,049 --> 01:28:43,108
Alan Stanwyk
murdered me tonight.

1348
01:28:46,621 --> 01:28:49,488
Charred remains found in the Jaguar
are mine, not his.

1349
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:52,717
Mr. Stanwyk,
using my name and passport...

1350
01:28:52,794 --> 01:28:54,921
boarded Pan Am Flight 306.

1351
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:57,021
- On arrival, he intends..."
- Pretty hefty.

1352
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:00,827
Keep reading.

1353
01:29:00,902 --> 01:29:03,393
...with his legal wife...

1354
01:29:03,471 --> 01:29:05,496
the former
Sally Ann Cavanaugh..."

1355
01:29:05,573 --> 01:29:07,131
Don't stop, Alan.

1356
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:15,206
- Uh-oh. The missus.
- What are you doing here?

1357
01:29:15,283 --> 01:29:18,047
I know most of it. I want
to hear the rest from you.

1358
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:22,781
He doesn't read my stuff very well.
Let me take a crack at it.

1359
01:29:22,857 --> 01:29:26,054
Sally Ann and Alan
were married eight years ago...

1360
01:29:28,563 --> 01:29:31,430
never divorced, making Stanwyk
a bigamist, even in Utah.

1361
01:29:32,567 --> 01:29:35,263
Stanwyk is traveling
with $3 million in cash...

1362
01:29:35,336 --> 01:29:38,601
the result of Gail Stanwyk's
conversion of Boyd Aviation stock."

1363
01:29:43,745 --> 01:29:45,576
Is true, isn't it?

1364
01:29:45,646 --> 01:29:47,580
Sally Ann
can confirm this...

1365
01:29:47,648 --> 01:29:49,639
when the police pick her up
at the Airport Marriott."

1366
01:29:49,717 --> 01:29:51,582
Isn't that where she is?

1367
01:29:53,254 --> 01:29:55,950
By the way,
Alan is a big drug smuggler.

1368
01:29:56,023 --> 01:29:59,459
But you can read about that
in tomorrow's paper.

1369
01:30:00,294 --> 01:30:02,728
Sincerely, I.M. Fletcher.
P.S. Have a nice day."

1370
01:30:03,731 --> 01:30:06,131
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
Bravo.

1371
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:09,966
What tipped me was something your wife
said while we were in bed together.

1372
01:30:14,242 --> 01:30:17,473
Oh?
And what was that?

1373
01:30:17,545 --> 01:30:21,037
She said we had roughly
the same build.

1374
01:30:21,115 --> 01:30:23,140
From the waist up,
I imagine.

1375
01:30:25,319 --> 01:30:27,219
Then I figured it.

1376
01:30:27,288 --> 01:30:29,381
You bump me off,
plop me in the car...

1377
01:30:29,457 --> 01:30:30,947
and burn me up.

1378
01:30:32,894 --> 01:30:35,454
What the heck,
same bone structure.

1379
01:30:35,530 --> 01:30:37,088
You son of a bitch.

1380
01:30:37,165 --> 01:30:40,066
But I'm not a stupid
son of a bitch.

1381
01:30:40,134 --> 01:30:42,694
I was prepared to commit
one murder, assface.

1382
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:46,206
What makes you think
I won't commit two?

1383
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:49,175
- Whoops.
- What do you mean, Whoops?

1384
01:30:49,243 --> 01:30:51,837
By the time your story's published,
I'll be on the beach.

1385
01:30:51,913 --> 01:30:55,679
I understand extradition
from South America's complicated.

1386
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:57,775
For two murders,
is even more so.

1387
01:30:58,853 --> 01:31:01,117
That thing loaded?

1388
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:02,656
If you shoot me...

1389
01:31:02,723 --> 01:31:04,884
you're liable to lose
those humanitarian awards.

1390
01:31:04,959 --> 01:31:06,654
Tough shit, Hopalong.

1391
01:31:06,727 --> 01:31:07,989
Greetings, everyone.

1392
01:31:09,864 --> 01:31:11,729
Thank God, the police.

1393
01:31:11,799 --> 01:31:14,267
What are you doing here?

1394
01:31:14,335 --> 01:31:16,963
Put the gun down.
I can take care of them.

1395
01:31:17,038 --> 01:31:20,030
Thought you had this figured out.
Nice going, Erwin.

1396
01:31:20,107 --> 01:31:22,371
Don't ever
call me Erwin.

1397
01:31:22,443 --> 01:31:25,037
Fat Sam and Gummy
left the beach today.

1398
01:31:25,112 --> 01:31:30,243
It occurred to me that maybe there are
things happening I should be aware of.

1399
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:33,651
I'll take care of this.
It doesn't involve you. Go home.

1400
01:31:33,721 --> 01:31:35,655
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- What? Long distance?

1401
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:39,149
Overheard you say something
about South American extradition.

1402
01:31:39,227 --> 01:31:43,755
Are you taking that $800,000
I staked you with on the next load?

1403
01:31:43,831 --> 01:31:45,890
You two have a lot
to talk over.

1404
01:31:45,967 --> 01:31:48,993
We'll just catch the last
ten minutes of Dynasty.

1405
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:51,265
[Alan] Jerry,
you're gonna have to trust me!

1406
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:54,502
I got a way to get rid of this asshole,
and you're jeopardizing everything!

1407
01:31:54,575 --> 01:31:56,668
Your way is gonna land my butt
on the front page...

1408
01:31:56,744 --> 01:31:58,507
while you're basking
in the sun!

1409
01:31:58,579 --> 01:32:00,171
With your money.

1410
01:32:15,930 --> 01:32:18,023
The second one's
going to be more fun.

1411
01:32:18,099 --> 01:32:19,964
Go ahead, make my day.

1412
01:32:45,693 --> 01:32:46,887
Thanks.

1413
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:50,160
No, this is getting absurd.

1414
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:53,064
One Bob Haldeman wig,
a gorilla suit.

1415
01:32:53,134 --> 01:32:55,068
- A gibbon suit.
- Tennis shorts.

1416
01:32:55,136 --> 01:32:56,831
leather sneakers,
wrist bands."

1417
01:32:56,904 --> 01:32:59,566
- Is business. I hate tennis.
- Whas novelty teeth?

1418
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:02,939
Frank, is all business.

1419
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:05,103
A nun's habit.
Six tubes of Crazy Glue.

1420
01:33:05,179 --> 01:33:06,771
Thas personal.

1421
01:33:06,847 --> 01:33:10,010
- Take it out of my raise.
- You're not getting a raise. Come on.

1422
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:13,850
I would think the D.A. would need
these tickets for evidence.

1423
01:33:13,921 --> 01:33:15,115
Not necessarily.

1424
01:33:15,189 --> 01:33:17,419
- Not necessarily?
- Larry!

1425
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:21,789
In the court ruling
U.S. vs. Fishbein...

1426
01:33:21,862 --> 01:33:24,422
a man subjected to
potential incineration...

1427
01:33:24,498 --> 01:33:26,329
while wearing
another man's suit...

1428
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,425
is entitled to $10,000 worth
of airline tickets.

1429
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:32,099
Is an obscure ruling
but very important one to me.

1430
01:33:32,173 --> 01:33:36,371
Why don't you say that you want
to take me to Rio with you?

1431
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:39,675
There's a different slant.

1432
01:33:41,682 --> 01:33:43,946
The thing is, we haven't
really dated formally.

1433
01:33:44,018 --> 01:33:46,009
I take first dates
to Laker games.

1434
01:33:46,087 --> 01:33:49,215
I don't want to go
to a Laker game.

1435
01:33:49,290 --> 01:33:50,552
I don't like basketball.

1436
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:53,389
Maybe thas because
you don't understand basketball.

1437
01:33:53,461 --> 01:33:56,157
You haven't learned the fundamentals.
The pick and roll.

1438
01:33:56,230 --> 01:33:58,164
Sounds like a fast-food chain.

1439
01:33:58,232 --> 01:34:00,223
- Reverse stuff.
- That I've done.

1440
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:02,394
I'll bet you have,
you little vixen.

1441
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:04,734
[Fletch] The coroner
had certified Stanwyk dead...

1442
01:34:04,805 --> 01:34:06,966
or extremely sleepy.

1443
01:34:07,041 --> 01:34:10,670
And Chief Karlin was facing
20 years in the fun house.

1444
01:34:10,745 --> 01:34:12,736
I decided
to accompany Gail to Rio...

1445
01:34:12,813 --> 01:34:15,611
and personally assist her
in her grief therapy.

1446
01:34:15,683 --> 01:34:19,278
On the beach, I explained basketball
to her, but she didn't grasp it.

1447
01:34:19,353 --> 01:34:21,480
- Fletch?
- Call me Erwin.

1448
01:34:21,555 --> 01:34:24,547
[Gail Laughs]

1449
01:34:24,625 --> 01:34:26,889
Why do they bounce
the ball the whole time?

1450
01:34:26,961 --> 01:34:29,623
Doesn't it seem
a little childish?

1451
01:34:29,697 --> 01:34:31,995
Well, it may seem that,
but thas called dribbling.

1452
01:34:32,066 --> 01:34:34,626
- Dribbling?
- If they stop bouncing the ball...

1453
01:34:34,702 --> 01:34:36,431
they get called for traveling.

1454
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:38,734
Traveling. Aha.

1455
01:34:38,806 --> 01:34:41,001
Thas what they call it
when you don't bounce the ball.

1456
01:34:41,075 --> 01:34:43,703
When it came to basketball,
Gail was a loss.

1457
01:34:43,778 --> 01:34:45,769
But we had our own version
of one-on-one...

1458
01:34:45,846 --> 01:34:49,475
and she thought I was the bravest man
in the world, which I am.

1459
01:34:49,550 --> 01:34:53,145
By the way, I charged the vacation to
Mr. Underhill's American Express card.

1460
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:54,551
Want the number?

1461
