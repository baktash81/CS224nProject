00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:45,503
Letters From Iwo Jima

2
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:59,309
IWO JIMA

3
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:13,925
How did those soldiers ever manage
to dig out these tunnels?

4
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,219
Let's get a rotation in here.

5
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,263
Hey, I found something!

6
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:33,111
IWO JIMA

7
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,404
<i>Hanako...</i>

8
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,282
<i>We soldiers dig.</i>

9
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,452
<i>We dig all day.</i>

10
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,539
<i>This is the hole that we will fight...</i>

11
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,083
<i>and die in.</i>

12
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,879
<i>Hanako...</i>

13
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,674
<i>am I digging my own grave?</i>

14
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,961
<i>Today, I head for the post
where my men await.</i>

15
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:37,050
<i>I am determined to serve
and give my life for my country.</i>

16
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,720
<i>I believe I have organized
everything at home...</i>

17
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:45,517
<i>but I am sorry I wasn 't able to attend
to the kitchen floor before I left.</i>

18
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,977
<i>I had all the intention...</i>

19
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,480
<i>but had to leave
without having the time...</i>

20
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,982
<i>and I am still worried about it.</i>

21
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,361
<i>So make sure to have
Taro take care of it promptly.</i>

22
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,413
Damn this island!
The Americans can have it.

23
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,208
Nothing grows here.

24
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:16,214
It smells. It's hot. There are too many
damn bugs, and there's no water.

25
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:22,303
This island is part
of Japan's sacred homeland.

26
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,681
There's nothing sacred about this island.

27
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,394
Saigo.

28
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,648
We should just give the island
to the Americans...

29
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,358
and then we can go home.

30
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,029
Saigo!

31
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,199
What did you say, soldier?

32
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:48,329
I said if we beat the Americans,
then we can go home.

33
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,624
You there, is that what he said?

34
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,378
Yes, sir.

35
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,295
I'm Kuribayashi.

36
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,173
Welcome, General.
I am Admiral Ohsugi.

37
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,884
How long have you been
waiting here for me?

38
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,387
Three hours, sir.

39
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:28,888
Sorry to hear that.

40
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,391
They wouldn't allow me
to wire my arrival...

41
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,643
after what happened
to Admiral Yamamoto.

42
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,019
I understand, sir.

43
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,147
This is my aide, Lieutenant Fujita.

44
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,275
What's the matter, Admiral?
You don't look very well.

45
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,820
It's nothing, sir. The water
doesn't agree with me here.

46
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,488
Sorry to hear that.

47
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,657
This way to your quarters.

48
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,535
Admiral, I want to make a round
of the island first.

49
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,787
Shall I fetch a vehicle?

50
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,914
No, let's walk.

51
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,542
Walking is good for the health.

52
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,878
It might be just what you need, Ohsugi.

53
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,562
So that's Suribachi.

54
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,697
You unpatriotic...

55
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,741
no-good peasants!

56
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,451
Hey, stop it!

57
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:36,289
Stand up!

58
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,666
What are you doing?

59
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,712
These soldiers...

60
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,550
were conspiring
with unpatriotic words, sir.

61
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,719
I see.

62
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,597
And, Captain, do you have
such an excess of soldiers...

63
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,391
that you could put two
of them out of commission?

64
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,519
No, sir.

65
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,063
Then stop beating them.

66
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,732
Deny their lunch rations instead.

67
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,986
A good captain uses his brain,
not just his whip.

68
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,701
What is all this?

69
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,537
All this?

70
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,122
Trenches, sir.

71
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,582
Why are the men digging trenches here?

72
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,961
This is where the Americans
are expected to land.

73
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,548
Have them stop immediately.

74
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,758
But, General...

75
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:30,593
And, Captain...

76
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,430
make sure these men get proper breaks.

77
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,224
They look like they're from Mars.

78
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,196
Stop digging!

79
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,007
Just as well.

80
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,052
My stomach has been
bothering me anyway.

81
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,473
A toast to General Kuribayashi...

82
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,851
a fine commander.

83
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,523
Better than sake!

84
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,109
I heard he lived in America.

85
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,780
Maybe that's why he
doesn't want us digging trenches.

86
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,656
Maybe he likes Americans.

87
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:37,494
No, stupid.
He studied the Americans.

88
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,373
So now he knows how to beat them.

89
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,877
I heard from someone in the 204th...

90
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:51,174
that another general was
supposed to command the island...

91
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:55,011
but he didn't want the job.

92
00:09:56,471 --> 00:10:00,517
So Premier Tojo gave it
to Kuribayashi instead.

93
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:05,814
Nozaki, you hear a lot of things...

94
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,401
but your ears are full of wax!

95
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:15,115
Anyway, you can't trust anyone
from the 204th.

96
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,158
They're part of the Navy.

97
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:20,495
I think this Kuribayashi
must be a superb general.

98
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,247
Look...

99
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:28,294
we're not digging those damn trenches
in the sand anymore, are we?

100
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,814
This heat is more than I had anticipated.

101
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:57,615
This island is bigger than I thought.
I'm exhausted.

102
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,416
Ito, reporting for duty.

103
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,626
Thank you for coming right away.

104
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,505
How much air force
do we have available?

105
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,258
41 Zekes and 13 bombers, sir.

106
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,468
Is that all?

107
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:20,722
In order to support Saipan,
we lost 66 planes a few days ago.

108
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:26,352
We will have to rely on support
from the Combined Fleet then.

109
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,315
Is this the current defense plan?

110
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,948
And what about the Army troops?
Where will they be stationed?

111
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,661
I don't know exactly.

112
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,706
They are under independent
command of Colonel Adachi.

113
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,250
You have not coordinated
your plans with the Army?

114
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,170
According to Navy rules,
until the enemy lands...

115
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,256
This is a real war!
You are aware of that, aren't you?

116
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,555
This will not work.

117
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,183
You are concentrating all
your efforts on the beaches.

118
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,812
- Move the artillery to higher ground.
- But, sir, we just had them...

119
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,563
moved down to the beaches.

120
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,190
Well, move them back.

121
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,153
Coordinate with the Army
and have them start immediately.

122
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,407
Fortifications at Suribachi are the priority.

123
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,158
I'm going to walk some more.

124
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,245
- It's pitch black out there, sir.
- I know.

125
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,757
This one is trouble.

126
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:43,054
Army commanders usually are, sir.

127
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,140
Another letter?

128
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,435
You know that the mail only goes out
when there's a boat available?

129
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,312
I have a lot of family.

130
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:35,648
Then how come all your letters
are addressed to your wife?

131
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,401
Nosey!

132
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,236
Here, let me do you a favor.

133
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,948
Otherwise, your letters
will never make it through.

134
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,826
Hey, what are you doing?

135
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,705
I used to work at the censorship office
in Tokyo before I was transferred.

136
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,458
You mean demoted.

137
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:57,962
"To Hanako: We soldiers dig.
We dig all day."

138
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,840
No, no, no. This will never pass.

139
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,427
Give me that back!

140
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:17,607
There. You'll thank me
for this later, Saigo.

141
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:22,612
Next!

142
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,370
Good!

143
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:58,523
Are you blind?

144
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,860
Can't you see the target?

145
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:06,531
Even my six-year-old could
shoot better than you do.

146
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:08,908
Do it again!

147
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:18,460
You're an embarrassment!
You call yourself an Imperial soldier?

148
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:23,965
Tonight you will clean the boots
of your entire troop.

149
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,216
Go to the rear!

150
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:31,347
They should learn to clean their guns
properly, rather than their boots.

151
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:08,760
What are those tanks doing here?

152
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:13,098
Those are out of commission, sir.
They are waiting for parts.

153
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,934
- For how long?
- About a month, sir.

154
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:39,165
<i>Taro, America is filled with cars.</i>

155
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:44,462
<i>I have to be very careful
when I cross the street...</i>

156
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,882
<i>there are so many cars everywhere.</i>

157
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:52,929
<i>Taro, are you behaving yourself
and listening to your mother?</i>

158
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,306
<i>I miss you.</i>

159
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,611
These civilians need to be
evacuated as soon as possible.

160
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,573
Yes, sir.

161
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:13,927
<i>Hanako...</i>

162
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,763
<i>we have a celebrity here.</i>

163
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:20,683
<i>Baron Nishi, the Olympic gold medalist
in horse jumping.</i>

164
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:24,896
<i>He will lead the 26th tank regiment...</i>

165
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:28,441
<i>and has just arrived from Tokyo.</i>

166
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:47,585
<i>Nishi is very handsome, and there are
rumors of his womanizing skills.</i>

167
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:53,091
<i>But there are no women
left on the island to woo.</i>

168
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:22,495
Lieutenant Colonel Nishi!
You brought your horse.

169
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,247
From Chichi Jima.

170
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,422
I used to be a cavalryman myself,
you know.

171
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,674
Of course, I know.

172
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:38,344
I've been looking forward
to serving under you.

173
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,431
One who understands horses
the way I do.

174
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:45,769
When we used to ride horses
through the battlefield...

175
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,812
those were the good old days...

176
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,274
not like these mechanized contraptions.

177
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,819
I could send for another horse...

178
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,197
and we could ride together.

179
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,032
I'm afraid my riding days are over.

180
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:05,413
But tell me about this famous horse
of yours that you won the Olympics with.

181
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,624
My stallion, Uranus.

182
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,138
Oh, yes, this horse has a fine back.

183
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,685
I bought him in Italy.

184
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,522
They were happy to get rid of him.

185
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:33,441
He was such a wild horse.

186
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:38,738
No one could tame the beast,
but I told them...

187
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:40,824
such a headstrong horse...

188
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:44,619
is a perfect match for me.

189
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,668
Come dine with me tonight.
I feel like having a drink.

190
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,087
I think that can be arranged.

191
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:06,224
How did you manage to get
the Johnnie Walker?

192
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,643
I drank some already.

193
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:17,777
I'm sorry. This is all we have.

194
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:20,071
That's fine, as long as we have this.

195
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,202
What is this empty plate?

196
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,372
I have told our cook that all officers...

197
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:31,875
will have the same rations
and food as our men.

198
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:35,128
I'm sorry, but serving three dishes
is regulation.

199
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:39,883
Oh, but of course we have the right to be
served more than three dishes per meal.

200
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,301
You're absolutely right.

201
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:54,272
When you think about it...

202
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:58,943
it is regrettable that most of the
Combined Fleet was destroyed.

203
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,280
We still have some battleships left...

204
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:07,452
but we have very little striking power
from the air or sea.

205
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:10,080
Nishi, what do you mean?

206
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:18,046
So you have not heard about
the Mariana battle?

207
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:24,135
Admiral Ozawa's carrier and boat planes
were destroyed.

208
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:28,098
The Imperial headquarters...

209
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:31,643
is deceiving not just the people,
but us as well.

210
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,813
If you want my honest opinion, General...

211
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:38,441
the best thing to do...

212
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:43,822
would be to sink the island
to the bottom of the sea.

213
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,159
And yet, you still came?

214
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:52,414
Well...

215
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:57,836
I figured your men were going to need
all the tanks that I could bring.

216
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:48,261
This must be it.

217
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:50,638
Yes, the enemy must land here.

218
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:57,187
Run!

219
00:23:58,229 --> 00:23:59,856
Like you were one of the Americans!

220
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:01,983
Go on! Which direction would you take?

221
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:32,097
Hey...

222
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:35,308
I think your general has gone mad.

223
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,022
Look at the gun he has.

224
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,613
He probably took it
from a dead American.

225
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:51,157
Maybe.

226
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:00,583
Break time is over.

227
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:02,544
Back to work!

228
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:08,925
Are you all right, Kashiwara?

229
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:11,136
You look pale.

230
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:15,014
I'm fine. It's just the damn water.

231
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:19,519
But... I... really... need to go.

232
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:41,166
There will be a major change
in our strategy.

233
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:46,588
We will dig caves in the Motoyama,
Higashiyama, and Suribachi-yama areas.

234
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:51,509
We will build these underground
fortifications, and fight to the end.

235
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:55,013
- What about the beach defenses, sir?
- Not needed.

236
00:25:56,473 --> 00:26:00,185
But, sir, the beach trenches
are our first line of defense.

237
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:03,730
Without the beach trenches,
how do you expect us to win?

238
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:08,902
Hayashi, do you know how many cars
America produces in a year?

239
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:10,236
Five million.

240
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:13,782
The Americans' technological
advancements cannot be underestimated.

241
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:16,743
They will cross the beaches eventually.

242
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:20,830
If we waste our soldiers there,
there is no hope for victory.

243
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:22,791
It is inevitable that men will die...

244
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:26,628
but I never heard of an island operation
without beach fortifications.

245
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:30,423
General, it will be a futile waste of time
to start digging tunnels now.

246
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,217
We should force the enemy
near the island...

247
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:34,552
and launch a pincer drive
from the sea and air.

248
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:37,097
I agree. That makes the most sense.

249
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:38,389
Ohsugi...

250
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:41,142
doesn't the Navy know?

251
00:26:45,188 --> 00:26:48,691
The Combined Fleet has been completely
destroyed off the Marianas.

252
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,985
The island is now isolated.

253
00:26:56,533 --> 00:27:00,245
What's more, I received a new order from
the Imperial headquarters this morning.

254
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,039
The remaining fighter planes
are to be sent back...

255
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:04,833
to Tokyo to defend the mainland.

256
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:08,044
Outrageous! How are we to fight?

257
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:15,718
We do not have time for discussion.
We should head back.

258
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,878
<i>Dear Mother...</i>

259
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:54,758
<i>I have been commissioned
to a new troop today.</i>

260
00:27:56,509 --> 00:28:00,013
<i>I cannot talk about this transfer now.</i>

261
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:03,308
<i>Take good care of yourself.</i>

262
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:18,823
Look at this picture.

263
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:23,787
That's some fancy castle.

264
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,749
You know who this castle was built for?

265
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:30,376
Someone who was already dead.

266
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,964
They must have had
a lot of money back then...

267
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:37,592
to build a castle like that
for a dead person.

268
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:41,429
Why are you reading that book anyway?

269
00:28:42,013 --> 00:28:44,724
We're never going to war over there.

270
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:48,978
We'll be lucky if we even get
a hole in the ground when we're dead.

271
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:51,731
Don't talk about that. It's bad luck.

272
00:28:57,404 --> 00:28:59,197
Is this the 312th?

273
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:00,949
That's right.

274
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:04,411
I'm Nozaki. This is Saigo.

275
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:09,749
Shimizu, you can put your bedroll there.

276
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:16,089
There's an empty space in the back.

277
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:18,967
Don't mind him.

278
00:29:20,218 --> 00:29:23,680
His friend Kashiwara just died.

279
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:26,349
That used to be his spot.

280
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:35,942
But we are all going to die.

281
00:29:36,735 --> 00:29:38,737
That's the plan, isn't it?

282
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:42,991
For our country, it is an honor.

283
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:47,579
Kashiwara died of honorable dysentery.

284
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:51,708
Shimizu, where are you from?

285
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:55,295
Kanagawa-ken.

286
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:59,048
Ozawa is from there, aren't you?

287
00:30:00,091 --> 00:30:01,426
That's right.

288
00:30:05,388 --> 00:30:07,015
Where were you trained?

289
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:10,727
Maybe we were at the same school?

290
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,854
No.

291
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:15,732
I trained in Tokyo.

292
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:18,485
I trained in Tokyo, too. Where?

293
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:28,078
<i>The Koho Kimmu Yoin Yoseijo.</i>

294
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,132
Hey...

295
00:30:42,592 --> 00:30:44,886
<i>why do you think they put
a Kempeitai in our unit?</i>

296
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:46,429
I don't know.

297
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:53,937
<i>He's not wearing the white armband.
He's not Kempeitai.</i>

298
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,899
<i>He went to the Kempeitai
military academy.</i>

299
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:00,944
Maybe he was kicked out.

300
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:06,825
<i>He acts like a Kempeitai.</i>

301
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:13,873
Look at his holster.
That's not standard issue.

302
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:19,379
He's been put here to spy on us.

303
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:23,633
Why would he spy on us?

304
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:29,097
Maybe it's those letters
you've been writing.

305
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:33,017
You should be careful.

306
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:01,755
Weed soup again?

307
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,343
Kuribayashi is conserving
our food supplies for the battle.

308
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:11,973
We'll be dead
before the Americans even get here.

309
00:32:13,808 --> 00:32:16,936
And you would think that with all my
war effort contributions...

310
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:20,774
<i>we should be eating kasutera cakes
or sandwiches.</i>

311
00:32:22,192 --> 00:32:23,359
What?

312
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:29,365
I ran a bakery in Ohmiya with my wife.

313
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:31,618
Back when we could still get sugar...

314
00:32:33,078 --> 00:32:37,707
<i>we sold ampan and kasutera cakes.</i>

315
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:49,511
<i>However, his Kempeitai brethren...</i>

316
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:52,931
used to come and take
whatever they wanted.

317
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:58,019
For the war...

318
00:32:59,854 --> 00:33:01,648
For the country...

319
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:05,693
Why bread?

320
00:33:08,863 --> 00:33:14,160
We ran into those types
at our clothing store as well.

321
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:18,790
When we started making sandwiches...

322
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:22,502
they took those, too.

323
00:33:24,587 --> 00:33:28,174
And when we ran out of meat
and just had bread, they still came.

324
00:33:33,346 --> 00:33:37,684
Eventually, they took all of our
baking equipment for the metal...

325
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:43,481
and we were out of business.

326
00:33:47,402 --> 00:33:49,195
I should have been a fisherman.

327
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:54,784
It must have been hard on your wife...

328
00:33:57,662 --> 00:34:00,206
without the shop
and without her husband.

329
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:37,869
Tell them to go away.
We have nothing to sell.

330
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:47,670
Congratulations! Your husband
is going to war.

331
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:04,187
Thank you very much.

332
00:35:04,854 --> 00:35:08,691
I'm happy to serve the country.

333
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:16,282
Prayers for your eternal success at arms.

334
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:21,329
I beg of you! We have only each other.

335
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:27,544
This is not the time.

336
00:35:29,587 --> 00:35:34,259
We have all sent our husbands
and sons to war.

337
00:35:35,093 --> 00:35:39,305
We all have to do our part.

338
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:45,937
At least you'll have a little one
to carry on your name.

339
00:35:59,242 --> 00:36:01,786
I can't eat with you like that.

340
00:36:04,789 --> 00:36:09,085
What am I going to do after you die?

341
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:17,719
I'm not in the coffin yet.

342
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:24,267
The men never come home,
not even a soul.

343
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:28,938
They'll never let you come home.

344
00:36:30,982 --> 00:36:32,400
Don't worry.

345
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:36,529
And now, with the baby.

346
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,513
Can you hear me?

347
00:37:03,264 --> 00:37:04,557
It's Dad.

348
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:08,603
Listen.

349
00:37:11,564 --> 00:37:15,276
Don't tell anyone
what I'm telling you now.

350
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:18,738
It's a secret.

351
00:37:33,962 --> 00:37:35,171
Your dad...

352
00:37:39,008 --> 00:37:41,052
is going to come home for you.

353
00:38:37,317 --> 00:38:38,526
Hurry up!

354
00:38:41,946 --> 00:38:43,490
The enemy approaches!

355
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:55,585
This is ridiculous!

356
00:38:56,169 --> 00:38:58,463
Why waste time digging these tunnels?

357
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:01,216
They are all going to die anyway.

358
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,386
At least he conceded
to the pillboxes on the beach.

359
00:39:18,316 --> 00:39:20,026
You wanted to see me, sir?

360
00:39:21,194 --> 00:39:22,737
Care for a drink?

361
00:39:28,201 --> 00:39:30,495
You have been looking
quite pale these days.

362
00:39:33,998 --> 00:39:37,836
It's the water. It has
never agreed with me.

363
00:39:38,253 --> 00:39:39,462
That's not good.

364
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:44,050
Why don't you go back
to the mainland to recoup?

365
00:39:45,635 --> 00:39:49,806
I have commissioned Admiral Ichimaru
to take your place.

366
00:39:51,516 --> 00:39:53,810
We are wasting time
digging these tunnels.

367
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:58,648
General, the island won't last
five days without fleet support.

368
00:40:00,233 --> 00:40:02,610
We should fight to the death.

369
00:40:04,028 --> 00:40:08,366
The tunnel-digging may be futile.

370
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:13,079
Maybe the stand on Iwo will be futile.

371
00:40:13,538 --> 00:40:15,749
Maybe the whole war is futile.

372
00:40:15,915 --> 00:40:17,584
But will you give up then?

373
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:20,044
We will defend this island
until we are dead!

374
00:40:20,211 --> 00:40:22,464
Until the very last soldier is dead!

375
00:40:23,298 --> 00:40:27,635
If our children can live safely
for one more day...

376
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:31,014
it would be worth the one more day
that we defend this island!

377
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:33,141
Ohsugi...

378
00:40:33,725 --> 00:40:37,729
if you have an ounce
of pride left as an officer...

379
00:40:38,605 --> 00:40:39,939
I beg of you...

380
00:40:40,565 --> 00:40:43,693
go back to headquarters
and ask them to send support.

381
00:41:08,426 --> 00:41:12,138
So the rumor is true?
I couldn't believe it.

382
00:41:13,556 --> 00:41:17,394
I'm grateful to be leaving this island.

383
00:41:19,145 --> 00:41:21,147
We may have had our differences...

384
00:41:22,315 --> 00:41:25,193
but I'm truly sorry to see you go.

385
00:41:26,694 --> 00:41:29,864
General Hayashi, it is up to you now.

386
00:41:31,449 --> 00:41:36,329
Kuribayashi belongs behind a desk,
not commanding war.

387
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,456
I understand.

388
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:42,335
There are many of us
who agree with you, sir.

389
00:41:57,392 --> 00:41:58,435
Listen.

390
00:41:58,935 --> 00:42:02,647
The Americans are likely to land here.

391
00:42:04,149 --> 00:42:06,568
Crossfire positions will be here...

392
00:42:07,694 --> 00:42:08,737
here...

393
00:42:09,863 --> 00:42:11,030
and here.

394
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:13,742
The fact is...

395
00:42:13,908 --> 00:42:20,206
we are completely
outnumbered in every sector.

396
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,002
But we have a great advantage.

397
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:27,589
Can anyone tell me what that is?

398
00:42:33,178 --> 00:42:36,181
The Americans are weak-willed
and inferior to Japanese soldiers.

399
00:42:36,347 --> 00:42:37,807
Very good, Shimizu.

400
00:42:38,725 --> 00:42:40,226
Why is that?

401
00:42:40,518 --> 00:42:42,103
They are not as disciplined...

402
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:44,981
and they let their emotions
interfere with their duty.

403
00:42:45,148 --> 00:42:46,441
That is correct.

404
00:42:50,111 --> 00:42:53,114
Here is the uniform
of an American medic.

405
00:42:54,574 --> 00:42:55,825
He should be your target.

406
00:42:56,659 --> 00:43:00,747
For Americans will risk the lives
of many soldiers to save this one.

407
00:43:01,664 --> 00:43:02,749
Understood?

408
00:43:14,302 --> 00:43:17,222
General, may I speak with you?

409
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:22,060
Please keep an eye on
Major General Hayashi.

410
00:43:24,312 --> 00:43:26,523
Thank you for your concern, Nishi...

411
00:43:26,856 --> 00:43:29,901
but we don't have any time to waste.

412
00:43:30,235 --> 00:43:33,488
We must think about what
we can do at this moment.

413
00:43:36,783 --> 00:43:38,243
Admiral Ichimaru.

414
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:43,289
Reporting for duty, sir.

415
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:45,917
Excuse me.

416
00:43:46,334 --> 00:43:48,920
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

417
00:45:47,372 --> 00:45:48,540
Jupiter!

418
00:45:51,376 --> 00:45:52,669
Jupiter.

419
00:46:43,928 --> 00:46:45,138
Yamazaki...

420
00:46:46,181 --> 00:46:49,309
what are you doing just
sitting there? Help us...

421
00:47:29,265 --> 00:47:32,102
I think he's writing about us
in his reports.

422
00:47:33,311 --> 00:47:34,979
He's just writing a letter.

423
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:38,358
It's been two months, Nozaki.

424
00:47:39,818 --> 00:47:41,611
He would have reported us by now.

425
00:47:41,778 --> 00:47:43,530
How can you be sure?

426
00:47:51,538 --> 00:47:54,332
Will they ever stop?

427
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:57,836
Day and night, day and night...

428
00:48:00,213 --> 00:48:02,173
It's driving me crazy!

429
00:48:03,007 --> 00:48:07,387
If the damn Americans
are going to invade...

430
00:48:09,264 --> 00:48:11,224
why don't they hurry up and land?

431
00:48:25,905 --> 00:48:27,198
<i>Tako-Chan...</i>

432
00:48:27,532 --> 00:48:31,536
<i>the four chicks that were born
two months ago have grown so much.</i>

433
00:48:31,995 --> 00:48:36,040
<i>The mother chicken leads them
for food every day...</i>

434
00:48:36,541 --> 00:48:40,712
<i>but they're giving me a hard time, picking
at the vegetable garden I have grown.</i>

435
00:48:45,675 --> 00:48:49,012
The fleet of American ships
has left Saipan.

436
00:48:57,437 --> 00:48:59,105
So they are on their way.

437
00:49:00,732 --> 00:49:02,525
Ready the troops.

438
00:49:38,269 --> 00:49:39,437
Men...

439
00:49:40,772 --> 00:49:43,775
the time has come
to show your true colors.

440
00:49:44,734 --> 00:49:47,070
As a member of the honorable
Imperial Army...

441
00:49:47,821 --> 00:49:50,281
I trust that you will fight with honor.

442
00:49:53,535 --> 00:49:57,497
This island is of utmost importance
to Japan.

443
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:00,166
<i>Should the island fall...</i>

444
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:04,129
the enemy...

445
00:50:05,046 --> 00:50:09,134
will use it as their base
to attack our homeland.

446
00:50:10,552 --> 00:50:12,137
For the mainland...

447
00:50:13,596 --> 00:50:15,181
For our homeland...

448
00:50:15,724 --> 00:50:18,143
Until the very last man.

449
00:50:19,018 --> 00:50:22,188
<i>Our duty is to stop the enemy right here.</i>

450
00:50:23,606 --> 00:50:25,066
<i>Not one of you...</i>

451
00:50:25,692 --> 00:50:28,903
is allowed to die until you have killed
10 enemy soldiers.

452
00:50:32,949 --> 00:50:36,286
Do not expect to return home alive.

453
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,917
I will always be in front of you.

454
00:50:52,052 --> 00:50:53,720
Long live the Emperor.

455
00:51:37,806 --> 00:51:41,142
<i>Take care and be well.</i>

456
00:51:42,644 --> 00:51:47,774
<i>I will fight courageously until the end,
in the spirit of Yamato.</i>

457
00:51:48,942 --> 00:51:53,321
<i>My heart will always be with you.</i>

458
00:51:54,364 --> 00:51:55,615
<i>Takeichi.</i>

459
00:52:12,006 --> 00:52:17,387
<i>Every household is assigned a quota
of bag-making for the gunpowder.</i>

460
00:52:18,179 --> 00:52:22,684
<i>I cannot help but get tense when I think
that these will be used in battle.</i>

461
00:52:23,518 --> 00:52:26,521
<i>Taro and Yoko laugh at me for this.</i>

462
00:52:27,397 --> 00:52:30,734
<i>Takako, on evacuation in Nagano,
is also doing well.</i>

463
00:52:31,568 --> 00:52:33,695
<i>I pray for your safety.</i>

464
00:52:34,696 --> 00:52:37,073
<i>Sincerely, Yoshi.</i>

465
00:52:51,004 --> 00:52:52,714
No one can shoot me now.

466
00:52:56,718 --> 00:53:00,930
That's a nice belt.
My wife sent me one, too.

467
00:53:05,685 --> 00:53:09,856
<i>Doesn't look like Mr. Kempeitai
has a thousand-stitch belt, does he?</i>

468
00:53:10,231 --> 00:53:12,734
Maybe he thinks it will clash
with his uniform.

469
00:53:12,901 --> 00:53:15,445
He probably doesn't believe
in superstitions, anyway.

470
00:53:20,408 --> 00:53:22,702
His mother made him one after all.

471
00:53:45,809 --> 00:53:48,978
- Maybe they're trying to sink the island.
- My head hurts.

472
00:53:49,229 --> 00:53:52,232
How many ships do you think
there are out there?

473
00:53:52,399 --> 00:53:56,111
At least 30. Maybe even 50.

474
00:53:56,444 --> 00:53:59,030
- They must be really close.
- I need to take a leak.

475
00:53:59,197 --> 00:54:01,950
Don't go near the sewers.
Dysentery is spreading through there.

476
00:54:02,117 --> 00:54:03,284
Where do I go then?

477
00:54:03,618 --> 00:54:05,620
There is a pot at the end of the cave.

478
00:54:25,974 --> 00:54:27,851
The shit pot is full.

479
00:54:28,143 --> 00:54:30,103
Someone needs to throw it out.

480
00:54:53,668 --> 00:54:56,045
If anything happens to that pot...

481
00:54:57,505 --> 00:55:02,385
you'll be carrying our shit away
with your hands.

482
00:56:09,452 --> 00:56:11,287
Is this some kind of a joke?

483
00:56:12,288 --> 00:56:14,791
Why are you always picking on me?

484
00:56:53,747 --> 00:56:58,209
Thank you, God. I take back
what I said before.

485
00:57:12,932 --> 00:57:14,768
Shall we commence fire?

486
00:57:15,143 --> 00:57:16,227
Not yet.

487
00:57:21,357 --> 00:57:23,943
The men wish to commence firing.

488
00:57:31,451 --> 00:57:32,786
Hold your fire!

489
00:57:36,122 --> 00:57:37,457
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

490
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,125
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

491
00:57:47,175 --> 00:57:50,220
They will take the beach
in no time if we do not resist.

492
00:57:50,387 --> 00:57:52,389
Wait until the beach is full.

493
00:58:15,078 --> 00:58:17,956
Let's go. Commence firing!

494
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,338
Commence firing!

495
00:58:26,464 --> 00:58:27,924
<i>Commence firing!</i>

496
00:59:30,028 --> 00:59:32,072
The guns of the Kitakubo unit
were destroyed.

497
00:59:32,238 --> 00:59:34,574
All the pillbox units on the beach
have been destroyed.

498
00:59:34,741 --> 00:59:36,659
However, all other forces are intact...

499
00:59:36,826 --> 00:59:39,079
and we estimate more than
1,000 enemy casualties.

500
00:59:39,579 --> 00:59:41,998
The pillbox destruction was unavoidable.

501
00:59:42,373 --> 00:59:44,501
Overall, that is good news.

502
00:59:44,751 --> 00:59:46,669
How are the men
holding up at Suribachi?

503
00:59:47,754 --> 00:59:49,130
Forces are intact.

504
00:59:52,884 --> 00:59:54,302
What is the enemy situation?

505
00:59:54,469 --> 00:59:57,472
Approximately 20,000 men and 80 tanks.

506
00:59:57,847 --> 01:00:02,102
There has to be more than that.
They still have men waiting in the boats.

507
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:04,813
Currently the enemy front extends...

508
01:00:05,271 --> 01:00:07,982
between Suribachi
and the south landing...

509
01:00:08,525 --> 01:00:10,777
and Chidori airfield south.

510
01:00:11,444 --> 01:00:15,657
Just as I thought... Suribachi
and the Motoyama airfield.

511
01:00:16,616 --> 01:00:18,910
They are making a two-pronged attack.

512
01:00:34,259 --> 01:00:37,429
That's not enough! I need more ammo.

513
01:01:02,662 --> 01:01:03,997
Take his place!

514
01:01:04,414 --> 01:01:06,541
- The machine gun is blasted.
- Use your rifle!

515
01:01:09,127 --> 01:01:10,670
Watch out! Imbecile!

516
01:01:11,755 --> 01:01:12,964
I can't rely on you.

517
01:01:13,131 --> 01:01:16,342
Go send a report to Colonel Adachi
that we need another machine gun.

518
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,011
Hurry up!

519
01:01:44,454 --> 01:01:46,706
Colonel Adachi is asking
for reinforcements.

520
01:01:47,082 --> 01:01:51,377
We can't afford to send reinforcements.
Tell him to hold out.

521
01:02:02,764 --> 01:02:04,057
Shoot him!

522
01:02:12,065 --> 01:02:14,401
- What's the matter?
- We're out of bullets!

523
01:02:33,086 --> 01:02:35,088
We are losing Suribachi.

524
01:02:35,922 --> 01:02:40,260
All is lost. Request permission
to lead a suicide mission.

525
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:43,763
No. You must try to hold them off.

526
01:02:44,514 --> 01:02:48,351
Do what you can to survive
and join forces in the north caves.

527
01:02:49,144 --> 01:02:50,228
But, sir...

528
01:02:50,937 --> 01:02:53,857
I have failed to hold Suribachi.

529
01:02:54,107 --> 01:02:57,026
Permit me to die with honor with
my men.

530
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,528
No, Colonel.

531
01:02:59,195 --> 01:03:00,530
<i>This is an order!</i>

532
01:03:05,952 --> 01:03:07,120
Adachi.

533
01:03:09,289 --> 01:03:10,457
Adachi!

534
01:03:23,386 --> 01:03:27,390
Sir, Captain Tanida
requests machine guns.

535
01:03:29,559 --> 01:03:30,852
It's over.

536
01:03:38,985 --> 01:03:40,195
Suicide...

537
01:03:41,571 --> 01:03:43,531
That's the only thing left.

538
01:03:44,407 --> 01:03:45,450
But...

539
01:03:46,785 --> 01:03:49,788
Here, take this to your commander.

540
01:04:34,749 --> 01:04:38,378
I heard General Kuribayashi
order Colonel Adachi to escape.

541
01:04:38,545 --> 01:04:39,587
Quiet!

542
01:04:43,133 --> 01:04:46,386
Escape is the coward's way.

543
01:04:47,554 --> 01:04:48,805
Sit down!

544
01:05:00,942 --> 01:05:02,026
Men...

545
01:05:04,904 --> 01:05:05,989
we are...

546
01:05:08,825 --> 01:05:11,161
honorable soldiers of the Emperor.

547
01:05:14,873 --> 01:05:16,416
Don't ever forget that.

548
01:05:20,587 --> 01:05:22,505
The only way left for us...

549
01:05:24,424 --> 01:05:26,342
is to die with honor.

550
01:05:30,096 --> 01:05:31,598
This is our fate...

551
01:05:33,266 --> 01:05:35,602
to find our place at Yasukuni Shrine.

552
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:42,358
I'll see you there.

553
01:06:02,128 --> 01:06:04,130
Soldiers, farewell!

554
01:07:59,412 --> 01:08:00,497
Stop!

555
01:08:08,088 --> 01:08:11,674
You should die like an honorable soldier.

556
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:14,094
Look, Shimizu...

557
01:08:16,846 --> 01:08:19,641
we can still join the troops
in the northern caves.

558
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,269
Our orders are to stay here until death.

559
01:08:23,436 --> 01:08:25,271
I heard General Kuribayashi himself.

560
01:08:26,398 --> 01:08:28,066
That's what he said...

561
01:08:29,901 --> 01:08:31,236
over the radio.

562
01:08:32,695 --> 01:08:33,947
It's true.

563
01:08:38,118 --> 01:08:40,286
We can die here...

564
01:08:41,913 --> 01:08:44,457
or we can continue fighting.

565
01:08:47,877 --> 01:08:50,755
Which would better serve the Emperor?

566
01:08:53,633 --> 01:08:55,135
Which one?

567
01:09:17,323 --> 01:09:18,700
Where does this go?

568
01:09:18,867 --> 01:09:21,161
It will take us closer to Motoyama.

569
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:29,085
Do you have orders to move back?

570
01:09:30,503 --> 01:09:32,464
Where are the rest of your men?

571
01:09:32,964 --> 01:09:34,299
All dead.

572
01:09:35,842 --> 01:09:37,719
It's the same with us.

573
01:09:45,727 --> 01:09:47,979
There should be an outlet
somewhere near here.

574
01:09:48,188 --> 01:09:49,355
Be quiet!

575
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:41,908
So you thought you could blow us up,
or burn us alive, did you?

576
01:10:57,590 --> 01:10:59,926
- Have we heard from Suribachi?
- No, sir.

577
01:11:00,093 --> 01:11:01,636
Send a messenger!

578
01:11:09,644 --> 01:11:13,606
Lieutenant Oiso has ordered us
to rendezvous at the east cave.

579
01:11:21,781 --> 01:11:24,743
We will make a run for Motoyama.

580
01:11:25,452 --> 01:11:28,079
There is no cover for two kilometers.

581
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:31,458
It will be every man for himself.

582
01:11:38,131 --> 01:11:39,966
See you on the other side.

583
01:11:40,633 --> 01:11:44,429
If not on this earth,
then in the next world.

584
01:11:59,402 --> 01:12:02,072
Don't run with the herd.
That's where the enemy will fire.

585
01:12:02,238 --> 01:12:03,448
Stay back.

586
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:05,617
That's cowardice!

587
01:12:07,577 --> 01:12:11,081
There is no use for a dead soldier.

588
01:12:41,027 --> 01:12:43,196
Wait until the flare is gone.

589
01:13:09,305 --> 01:13:11,057
Crawl forward.

590
01:13:29,534 --> 01:13:31,077
What happened to the messenger?

591
01:13:31,327 --> 01:13:32,704
He never came back.

592
01:13:36,708 --> 01:13:38,334
I will go to Adachi myself.

593
01:13:38,585 --> 01:13:41,713
Motoyama's transmitter
still works, General.

594
01:13:42,964 --> 01:13:44,841
Why not try there, sir?

595
01:14:05,945 --> 01:14:07,947
Sir, these men retreated
from Mt. Suribachi.

596
01:14:15,038 --> 01:14:16,414
What are your names?

597
01:14:16,706 --> 01:14:19,250
Saigo, from the 312th.

598
01:14:19,876 --> 01:14:21,419
Shimizu, reporting for duty.

599
01:14:23,588 --> 01:14:25,590
You escaped from Suribachi?

600
01:14:32,055 --> 01:14:34,099
How dare you!

601
01:14:36,017 --> 01:14:38,937
It was your duty
to stay in your position until death.

602
01:14:41,231 --> 01:14:42,816
You should have died...

603
01:14:43,733 --> 01:14:46,111
with your fellow troop members.

604
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:51,157
You are both a disgrace.

605
01:14:55,286 --> 01:14:56,788
Get on your knees.

606
01:14:59,416 --> 01:15:02,127
- But, sir...
- I said, get on your knees!

607
01:15:22,355 --> 01:15:24,774
I don't want you to kill
my soldiers needlessly.

608
01:15:26,484 --> 01:15:28,069
Put down your sword.

609
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:29,904
Put it down!

610
01:15:36,286 --> 01:15:37,829
What's going on here?

611
01:15:40,165 --> 01:15:44,377
These men ran from Suribachi.

612
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:51,718
Lt. Ito, I gave the order that all survivors
retreat to the north caves.

613
01:15:54,054 --> 01:15:55,722
I am very sorry, General.

614
01:15:57,974 --> 01:15:59,225
It's just...

615
01:16:00,518 --> 01:16:01,978
Suribachi...

616
01:16:04,355 --> 01:16:05,774
has fallen.

617
01:16:27,087 --> 01:16:28,755
Now that Suribachi has been taken...

618
01:16:28,922 --> 01:16:31,341
the enemy will maneuver all forces
onto the hillside.

619
01:16:31,508 --> 01:16:33,510
We must move
our command center north, sir.

620
01:16:39,891 --> 01:16:41,017
Ito...

621
01:16:43,186 --> 01:16:45,355
fight for your fallen brethren...

622
01:16:47,190 --> 01:16:48,900
until the end.

623
01:17:11,423 --> 01:17:12,882
Get up!

624
01:17:17,178 --> 01:17:19,222
Major General Hayashi
is leading an attack.

625
01:17:19,389 --> 01:17:21,015
We are to join him.

626
01:17:24,561 --> 01:17:26,938
Kuribayashi's orders are
to remain in the caves.

627
01:17:29,441 --> 01:17:33,737
Lieutenant Ito says Kuribayashi
is a weak American sympathizer.

628
01:17:43,663 --> 01:17:46,499
We will take back Mt. Suribachi.

629
01:18:08,605 --> 01:18:10,648
Where is Major General Hayashi?

630
01:18:13,234 --> 01:18:14,611
We don't know, sir.

631
01:18:15,236 --> 01:18:16,654
Who is in charge here?

632
01:18:16,905 --> 01:18:18,782
I'm not sure.

633
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:24,287
Stay here until
I determine the plan of action.

634
01:18:50,063 --> 01:18:51,564
We're dead.

635
01:18:57,529 --> 01:18:59,656
Pull back!

636
01:19:00,198 --> 01:19:02,033
We'll get reinforcements.

637
01:19:34,357 --> 01:19:39,195
Why didn't your regiment join the attack?

638
01:19:43,241 --> 01:19:44,951
Don't sit here like rats!

639
01:19:45,827 --> 01:19:49,414
Come out of your caves and fight!

640
01:19:51,207 --> 01:19:52,792
Where is your commander?

641
01:19:52,959 --> 01:19:54,836
We haven't received the order to attack.

642
01:19:58,506 --> 01:20:01,259
Didn't you receive the order
from General Hayashi?

643
01:20:02,677 --> 01:20:05,764
Kuribayashi countermanded
Hayashi's order.

644
01:20:06,306 --> 01:20:08,224
There is to be no attack.

645
01:20:11,895 --> 01:20:14,064
We will take back Suribachi...

646
01:20:15,023 --> 01:20:16,649
with or without Kuribayashi.

647
01:20:17,358 --> 01:20:20,570
There are already troops on the attack.
Get your men in order.

648
01:20:20,737 --> 01:20:23,406
Lieutenant, may I remind you
of your rank!

649
01:20:23,573 --> 01:20:25,950
Your disrespect for senior officers...

650
01:20:26,785 --> 01:20:29,579
puts your men at needless risk.

651
01:20:31,623 --> 01:20:33,625
I suggest you go back to your cave...

652
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:37,670
or hand over your men.

653
01:20:47,889 --> 01:20:49,099
Enough.

654
01:20:49,516 --> 01:20:51,267
We'll do it ourselves.

655
01:21:02,362 --> 01:21:03,738
That's against regulations.

656
01:21:04,072 --> 01:21:07,659
That's the officer who tried to kill us.
He doesn't care.

657
01:21:39,816 --> 01:21:41,192
I won't go back.

658
01:21:43,236 --> 01:21:45,447
I've had enough of cave fighting.

659
01:21:47,657 --> 01:21:50,535
You men are now under
Lieutenant Colonel Nishi's command.

660
01:22:02,630 --> 01:22:04,507
I will throw myself under an enemy tank.

661
01:22:08,094 --> 01:22:10,638
I will take out one of their machines.

662
01:22:39,250 --> 01:22:40,502
Hurry.

663
01:22:42,879 --> 01:22:44,297
What is the status?

664
01:22:46,091 --> 01:22:47,842
A thousand men were lost...

665
01:22:48,009 --> 01:22:49,886
in a night attack along Chidori airfield.

666
01:22:50,053 --> 01:22:52,847
Why? I have given them strict orders
not to kill themselves.

667
01:22:53,014 --> 01:22:56,768
It seems that the order to retreat
was not conveyed to all sectors.

668
01:22:57,644 --> 01:22:58,895
Hayashi.

669
01:22:59,396 --> 01:23:00,730
Damn you!

670
01:23:01,815 --> 01:23:03,316
And the American advancement?

671
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:07,695
A battalion is headed north and we
are fighting back along the west ridge.

672
01:23:07,862 --> 01:23:12,117
Good. Once they cross the west ridge,
they will be surrounded on three sides.

673
01:23:13,535 --> 01:23:14,828
This just arrived.

674
01:23:14,994 --> 01:23:16,121
Read it.

675
01:23:21,084 --> 01:23:22,627
From headquarters...

676
01:23:24,796 --> 01:23:29,467
"We regret that we are unable to send
reinforcements to Iwo at this time.

677
01:23:30,885 --> 01:23:34,389
We earnestly hope you will
fight honorably...

678
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:37,350
and die for your country."

679
01:25:19,411 --> 01:25:20,537
Bring him in.

680
01:25:36,302 --> 01:25:37,345
Bring him in.

681
01:25:47,772 --> 01:25:49,941
Shall I finish him off?

682
01:25:50,692 --> 01:25:52,694
No. Treat him.

683
01:25:54,112 --> 01:25:55,363
But, sir...

684
01:25:55,530 --> 01:25:58,158
Okubo, you would expect the same,
wouldn't you?

685
01:25:58,324 --> 01:25:59,617
Endo, treat him.

686
01:26:00,035 --> 01:26:02,829
We are low on morphine as it is.

687
01:26:04,289 --> 01:26:07,125
Sir, the Americans would not treat
a wounded Japanese soldier.

688
01:26:07,292 --> 01:26:10,253
Son, have you ever met one?

689
01:26:11,796 --> 01:26:12,922
Treat him.

690
01:26:50,418 --> 01:26:52,504
Where are you, American tanks?

691
01:26:53,588 --> 01:26:55,215
Come and get me!

692
01:27:10,855 --> 01:27:12,482
How is the prisoner doing?

693
01:27:12,982 --> 01:27:14,317
He is awake, sir.

694
01:27:18,279 --> 01:27:21,449
I will question the prisoner
for information.

695
01:29:07,972 --> 01:29:09,224
Damn.

696
01:29:11,601 --> 01:29:13,103
I've had enough of this.

697
01:29:13,812 --> 01:29:15,397
I'm going to surrender.

698
01:29:20,110 --> 01:29:22,028
Go ahead and arrest me.

699
01:29:23,279 --> 01:29:27,033
I don't care anymore. That's what
you were put here for, isn't it?

700
01:29:28,451 --> 01:29:30,912
To report treasonous thoughts.

701
01:29:35,417 --> 01:29:37,210
I was put here because...

702
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:40,797
<i>I was discharged from the Kempeitai.</i>

703
01:29:44,050 --> 01:29:45,218
Discharged?

704
01:29:49,848 --> 01:29:53,143
I had only been in service
for five days.

705
01:29:56,396 --> 01:29:57,480
Shimizu...

706
01:29:57,647 --> 01:30:00,400
you must always be firm.

707
01:30:01,526 --> 01:30:05,739
Any mercy and people
will take advantage of you.

708
01:30:11,244 --> 01:30:12,412
That's unpatriotic.

709
01:30:12,704 --> 01:30:14,247
Go sort it out, Shimizu.

710
01:30:26,926 --> 01:30:29,763
You do not have the Imperial flag
properly displayed.

711
01:30:29,929 --> 01:30:31,181
I'm sorry.

712
01:30:31,347 --> 01:30:34,851
My husband has gone to war
and I couldn't put it up myself.

713
01:30:35,018 --> 01:30:37,729
It is unpatriotic
not to have the flag displayed.

714
01:30:37,896 --> 01:30:40,190
If you help me, I'll put it up now.

715
01:31:00,710 --> 01:31:02,629
Get that dog to shut up.

716
01:31:04,214 --> 01:31:05,382
What was that, sir?

717
01:31:06,549 --> 01:31:10,804
That dog is a nuisance.
It is disruptive of Army communications.

718
01:31:11,388 --> 01:31:13,431
I am very sorry, sir.

719
01:31:19,813 --> 01:31:21,898
Shimizu. Dispose of the dog.

720
01:31:23,233 --> 01:31:26,778
We can't have a dog interfering
with important military commands.

721
01:31:32,575 --> 01:31:34,202
Take the dog in the back.

722
01:31:34,536 --> 01:31:35,912
It's only a dog.

723
01:31:36,121 --> 01:31:38,707
It won't happen again.

724
01:31:39,165 --> 01:31:40,583
Take it out back.

725
01:31:41,084 --> 01:31:42,752
Keep the children inside.

726
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:45,171
Hurry up.

727
01:32:33,470 --> 01:32:35,805
Take the dog into the house
and keep him quiet...

728
01:32:36,473 --> 01:32:37,515
and never let him out.

729
01:32:49,694 --> 01:32:51,237
It's taken care of, sir.

730
01:33:29,609 --> 01:33:31,528
Are you trying to make a fool out of me?

731
01:33:33,363 --> 01:33:38,702
If you can't even shoot a dog,
you'll never be able to handle the Reds.

732
01:33:40,453 --> 01:33:41,871
You are unpatriotic!

733
01:33:48,086 --> 01:33:50,463
I was discharged for insubordination...

734
01:33:51,673 --> 01:33:53,383
and sent here.

735
01:34:02,183 --> 01:34:03,935
Don't look so glum, Shimizu.

736
01:34:05,478 --> 01:34:08,106
At least now only the enemy hates you.

737
01:34:13,236 --> 01:34:14,988
I don't blame the dog.

738
01:34:40,764 --> 01:34:41,931
<i>Taro...</i>

739
01:34:42,348 --> 01:34:45,268
<i>tonight I attended my farewell party.</i>

740
01:34:45,894 --> 01:34:48,438
<i>The wives also attended,
so there was a lot of fuss.</i>

741
01:34:48,605 --> 01:34:51,524
<i>Greeting all the ladies...</i>

742
01:34:51,775 --> 01:34:54,903
<i>kept me from enjoying the food.</i>

743
01:37:39,984 --> 01:37:42,028
Is there any information
of the enemy's plan?

744
01:37:42,821 --> 01:37:45,031
No, it's just a letter.

745
01:37:46,908 --> 01:37:48,702
It's from his mother.

746
01:37:51,162 --> 01:37:52,247
"Sam...

747
01:37:53,289 --> 01:37:55,625
I have mailed you
a couple of books to read.

748
01:37:56,251 --> 01:37:57,794
I hope that you like them.

749
01:37:59,129 --> 01:38:00,171
Yesterday...

750
01:38:00,922 --> 01:38:05,677
the dogs dug a hole under the fence.

751
01:38:07,053 --> 01:38:11,307
They ran all over the neighborhood.

752
01:38:12,392 --> 01:38:14,602
By the time we found them...

753
01:38:15,812 --> 01:38:20,817
the Harrisons' roosters were terrorized.

754
01:38:21,609 --> 01:38:24,446
Don't worry about us.

755
01:38:25,697 --> 01:38:29,784
Just take care of yourself
and come back safely.

756
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:33,872
Remember what I said to you...

757
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:39,127
always do what is right...

758
01:38:40,211 --> 01:38:42,422
because it is right.

759
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:47,260
I pray for a speedy end to the war...

760
01:38:47,427 --> 01:38:48,845
and your safe return.

761
01:38:50,430 --> 01:38:51,765
Love, Mom."

762
01:39:26,424 --> 01:39:29,052
I'm sorry, sir. There is no more medicine.

763
01:39:29,219 --> 01:39:32,389
It's all right. I'm useless now.
Go help the others!

764
01:41:03,730 --> 01:41:05,774
Okubo, come here.

765
01:41:12,489 --> 01:41:14,240
How are we on ammunition?

766
01:41:16,326 --> 01:41:18,745
Not good, sir.

767
01:41:20,288 --> 01:41:22,248
Our mortars have been taken out...

768
01:41:23,041 --> 01:41:24,918
and we're out of machine gun ammo.

769
01:41:26,711 --> 01:41:30,048
We have only our rifles.

770
01:41:32,092 --> 01:41:33,134
Okubo...

771
01:41:33,301 --> 01:41:37,097
you are now in charge of the men.

772
01:41:41,851 --> 01:41:43,436
We can no longer hold this area.

773
01:41:44,187 --> 01:41:47,690
You must guide
the rest of the men north.

774
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:53,738
Take whatever food and ammo
we have left.

775
01:41:54,906 --> 01:41:57,283
What about you, sir?

776
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:04,124
I'm tired of sharing this cave
with all of you.

777
01:42:04,958 --> 01:42:07,502
I'm a one-man show from here on out.

778
01:42:07,836 --> 01:42:09,587
What are you talking about, sir?

779
01:42:10,964 --> 01:42:14,259
Your first order of business...

780
01:42:15,301 --> 01:42:17,053
is to find some water.

781
01:42:44,039 --> 01:42:45,206
Men...

782
01:42:46,666 --> 01:42:48,293
do your best.

783
01:42:49,794 --> 01:42:54,215
Do what is right...

784
01:42:56,051 --> 01:42:58,303
because it is right.

785
01:43:00,472 --> 01:43:01,723
Understood?

786
01:43:09,522 --> 01:43:14,486
I will make sure that they send you
medicine and food.

787
01:43:16,738 --> 01:43:18,073
It has been a great honor...

788
01:43:19,491 --> 01:43:20,742
to serve...

789
01:43:22,035 --> 01:43:23,495
under you.

790
01:44:02,659 --> 01:44:04,202
Hand me my rifle.

791
01:44:28,017 --> 01:44:29,894
I'm sorry, Okubo.

792
01:45:50,016 --> 01:45:53,228
Why am I not getting any reports?
Have we heard from Admiral Ichimaru?

793
01:45:53,395 --> 01:45:56,147
- No, sir.
- What about Nishi or Hayashi?

794
01:45:58,608 --> 01:46:01,653
- Send out messengers!
- We have. Many times.

795
01:46:01,903 --> 01:46:03,613
None of them have come back.

796
01:46:04,114 --> 01:46:05,907
You can't plan strategy like this!

797
01:46:17,085 --> 01:46:20,588
I have been thinking about
what Lt. Colonel Nishi said.

798
01:46:21,339 --> 01:46:22,757
He's right.

799
01:46:28,012 --> 01:46:30,932
I don't know anything about the enemy.

800
01:46:31,683 --> 01:46:35,353
I believed that the Americans
were cowards...

801
01:46:41,484 --> 01:46:43,278
but they weren't.

802
01:46:48,491 --> 01:46:50,660
I was taught...

803
01:46:52,328 --> 01:46:54,039
that they were savages...

804
01:46:55,832 --> 01:46:57,834
but that American soldier...

805
01:47:05,341 --> 01:47:07,469
his mother's words...

806
01:47:11,389 --> 01:47:13,516
were the same as my mother's.

807
01:47:14,726 --> 01:47:18,730
I want to fulfill my duty
for the general...

808
01:47:19,647 --> 01:47:21,816
and our country...

809
01:47:23,526 --> 01:47:25,695
but I don't want to die for nothing.

810
01:47:31,701 --> 01:47:33,036
What do you think?

811
01:47:45,256 --> 01:47:46,383
You...

812
01:47:47,675 --> 01:47:50,428
haven't lived enough to realize...

813
01:47:55,266 --> 01:47:57,727
what you are sacrificing.

814
01:48:06,069 --> 01:48:08,279
Will you surrender with me?

815
01:48:29,718 --> 01:48:31,052
Careful.

816
01:48:34,639 --> 01:48:38,435
They'll notice if we leave together.
You go first.

817
01:48:39,436 --> 01:48:41,187
I'll make up an excuse.

818
01:48:41,354 --> 01:48:43,982
After a while, I'll tell them
I'm going to check on you.

819
01:48:44,149 --> 01:48:46,151
We'll be gone before they even notice.

820
01:48:49,571 --> 01:48:51,614
Pretend that you have dysentery.

821
01:48:52,449 --> 01:48:54,659
Give me your dysentery look.

822
01:49:04,627 --> 01:49:06,296
I guess that'll have to do.

823
01:49:15,263 --> 01:49:16,806
Where are you going?

824
01:49:17,140 --> 01:49:18,808
I've got dysentery.

825
01:49:19,267 --> 01:49:21,186
You're going to surrender, aren't you?

826
01:49:21,352 --> 01:49:23,480
If you are, take me with you.

827
01:49:24,105 --> 01:49:26,691
- I've had enough of this war.
- Be quiet!

828
01:49:35,158 --> 01:49:37,660
Where are you going?

829
01:49:37,911 --> 01:49:40,372
He said he wasn't feeling well.
It could be dysentery.

830
01:49:40,538 --> 01:49:41,831
You two! Stop!

831
01:49:47,587 --> 01:49:48,880
Sir, maybe they got spooked.

832
01:50:06,189 --> 01:50:08,650
Miura, you're on guard.

833
01:50:09,317 --> 01:50:11,319
Make sure we have no more deserters.

834
01:51:37,614 --> 01:51:39,240
What unit were you with?

835
01:51:42,077 --> 01:51:45,955
Higashiyama 314th.

836
01:51:55,673 --> 01:51:57,133
Did you hear...

837
01:51:58,802 --> 01:52:02,430
I heard that they would give you a meal.

838
01:52:04,432 --> 01:52:05,642
A meal...

839
01:52:09,813 --> 01:52:11,523
That sounds good.

840
01:52:16,528 --> 01:52:18,196
I'm from Yokohama, too.

841
01:52:21,658 --> 01:52:24,953
After this is over, you can come visit me.

842
01:53:41,237 --> 01:53:42,447
Lieutenant!

843
01:54:24,114 --> 01:54:25,907
Let this be a lesson to anyone else...

844
01:54:28,118 --> 01:54:29,786
who wants to surrender.

845
01:55:42,692 --> 01:55:46,529
We need to get through the crossfire
to reach the north...

846
01:55:47,405 --> 01:55:49,115
and join our forces at the front.

847
01:55:55,163 --> 01:55:56,247
Listen.

848
01:55:57,332 --> 01:55:59,834
We'll head for that cave
and make our way from there.

849
01:56:03,380 --> 01:56:04,923
Don't waste a bullet!

850
01:56:06,091 --> 01:56:07,550
Not a single one.

851
01:56:08,093 --> 01:56:09,677
Don't shoot recklessly.

852
01:57:10,321 --> 01:57:14,409
These are Nishi's troops
and the survivors from Suribachi.

853
01:57:18,496 --> 01:57:20,457
Are there no officers?

854
01:57:24,294 --> 01:57:26,588
You all did a good job making it here.

855
01:57:27,630 --> 01:57:29,299
Fujita, water for them.

856
01:57:33,970 --> 01:57:36,848
I'm sorry, sir. There is no more water.

857
01:57:40,685 --> 01:57:41,811
I'm sorry.

858
01:57:43,146 --> 01:57:44,481
At least you can rest.

859
01:57:59,662 --> 01:58:01,289
You look familiar.

860
01:58:06,503 --> 01:58:08,129
You almost lost your head.

861
01:58:11,174 --> 01:58:15,220
That was the second time you saved me.

862
01:58:18,014 --> 01:58:19,474
The first time...

863
01:58:20,183 --> 01:58:23,812
was the day you landed on the island.

864
01:58:27,565 --> 01:58:29,526
Of course. I remember.

865
01:58:31,194 --> 01:58:32,821
Well, everything happens in threes.

866
01:58:49,504 --> 01:58:50,839
<i>Hanako...</i>

867
01:58:51,881 --> 01:58:54,259
<i>This letter will probably
never get to you...</i>

868
01:58:54,968 --> 01:58:56,010
<i>but...</i>

869
01:58:56,720 --> 01:58:58,930
<i>it comforts me to write.</i>

870
01:59:00,390 --> 01:59:02,934
<i>For five days, we've been
without water and food.</i>

871
01:59:04,227 --> 01:59:06,020
<i>To survive...</i>

872
01:59:07,772 --> 01:59:09,858
<i>we do unspeakable things.</i>

873
01:59:12,861 --> 01:59:14,696
<i>There is no escape now.</i>

874
01:59:15,447 --> 01:59:16,614
<i>But...</i>

875
01:59:17,866 --> 01:59:20,702
<i>my only concern is for you and the baby.</i>

876
01:59:27,250 --> 01:59:28,793
Dig up some worms.

877
01:59:47,896 --> 01:59:50,607
<i>The battle is approaching its end...</i>

878
01:59:51,149 --> 01:59:53,902
<i>and there is no more ammunition,
no more water.</i>

879
01:59:54,069 --> 01:59:57,572
<i>All the survivors will engage
in a general attack.</i>

880
01:59:58,907 --> 02:00:02,327
<i>I pray for the victory
and safety of the Empire.</i>

881
02:00:02,952 --> 02:00:05,080
<i>I bid you farewell.</i>

882
02:00:06,748 --> 02:00:10,794
<i>For the country,
I could not fulfill all of my duties.</i>

883
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:14,923
<i>Now that we have no ammunition,
it is with regret that we must perish.</i>

884
02:00:21,429 --> 02:00:24,599
You made it all the way from Suribachi?

885
02:00:27,477 --> 02:00:29,688
That must have been quite a journey.

886
02:00:35,443 --> 02:00:37,028
You are quite a soldier.

887
02:00:39,364 --> 02:00:40,782
No, sir.

888
02:00:41,825 --> 02:00:43,159
I'm just a simple baker.

889
02:00:43,993 --> 02:00:45,787
You were a baker?

890
02:00:47,288 --> 02:00:48,331
Any family?

891
02:00:49,374 --> 02:00:50,667
A wife...

892
02:00:51,292 --> 02:00:55,839
and a baby girl born
last summer in Ohmiya.

893
02:00:59,342 --> 02:01:00,969
I haven't met her yet.

894
02:01:07,225 --> 02:01:08,643
It's strange.

895
02:01:11,187 --> 02:01:14,733
I promised myself to fight
until death for my family...

896
02:01:16,651 --> 02:01:20,989
but the thought of my family
makes it difficult to keep that promise.

897
02:01:44,387 --> 02:01:46,347
A radio transmission from the homeland.

898
02:02:00,028 --> 02:02:01,488
<i>For General Kuribayashi...</i>

899
02:02:01,654 --> 02:02:06,034
<i>and his troops, who are fighting bravely
for our country...</i>

900
02:02:06,201 --> 02:02:08,495
<i>a song will be sung by the children
of Nagano...</i>

901
02:02:08,661 --> 02:02:10,789
<i>which is Kuribayashi's hometown.</i>

902
02:02:11,122 --> 02:02:15,251
<i>On the waves of the Pacific</i>

903
02:02:15,418 --> 02:02:18,713
<i>down south from the Imperial City</i>

904
02:02:19,255 --> 02:02:23,927
<i>a small lonely island floats</i>

905
02:02:27,305 --> 02:02:30,934
<i>The fate of our Imperial country</i>

906
02:02:31,101 --> 02:02:35,772
<i>lies in the hands of this island</i>

907
02:02:38,608 --> 02:02:41,236
<i>Iwo Jima</i>

908
02:02:44,781 --> 02:02:48,284
<i>As long as we stand</i>

909
02:02:48,743 --> 02:02:52,831
<i>we shall feel safe, as the Imperial land</i>

910
02:02:52,997 --> 02:02:57,669
<i>shall forever be at peace</i>

911
02:03:00,964 --> 02:03:05,635
<i>We shall fight with pride
and honor at any price</i>

912
02:03:08,012 --> 02:03:11,599
<i>Our proud island</i>

913
02:03:12,183 --> 02:03:14,853
<i>Iwo Jima</i>

914
02:03:37,167 --> 02:03:38,501
Do me a favor.

915
02:03:40,170 --> 02:03:43,965
Stay here and burn all these documents,
and my military chest.

916
02:03:45,133 --> 02:03:47,302
Everything happens in threes.

917
02:04:16,748 --> 02:04:18,792
We will make a general attack.

918
02:04:19,876 --> 02:04:22,212
Although Japan has lost...

919
02:04:22,921 --> 02:04:24,798
one day...

920
02:04:25,673 --> 02:04:27,801
our people will praise your dedication.

921
02:04:28,927 --> 02:04:32,972
A day will come when they
will weep and pray for your souls.

922
02:04:35,683 --> 02:04:37,977
Be proud to die for your country.

923
02:04:45,110 --> 02:04:47,612
I will always be in front of you.

924
02:07:30,233 --> 02:07:31,484
No more.

925
02:07:33,653 --> 02:07:34,696
No more.

926
02:07:42,746 --> 02:07:44,456
Thank you, Fujita.

927
02:08:16,613 --> 02:08:17,781
This is an order.

928
02:09:26,224 --> 02:09:27,434
You again.

929
02:09:30,895 --> 02:09:34,691
I have one more favor to ask of you.

930
02:09:36,735 --> 02:09:37,944
Bury me...

931
02:09:39,070 --> 02:09:41,072
so that no one will find me.

932
02:09:55,628 --> 02:09:56,671
<i>Taro...</i>

933
02:09:57,047 --> 02:09:58,548
<i>I will be home soon.</i>

934
02:09:59,799 --> 02:10:01,801
<i>I'm glad to be going back to Japan...</i>

935
02:10:02,761 --> 02:10:06,181
<i>but I'm a bit sad
to leave my friends behind.</i>

936
02:10:09,642 --> 02:10:11,227
<i>I drove home...</i>

937
02:10:12,312 --> 02:10:13,355
<i>but...</i>

938
02:10:13,772 --> 02:10:16,399
<i>it's lonely driving all by myself.</i>

939
02:10:28,828 --> 02:10:30,830
Is this still Japanese soil?

940
02:10:40,340 --> 02:10:42,092
This is still Japan.

941
02:12:48,468 --> 02:12:49,677
Just put the shovel down.

942
02:14:02,876 --> 02:14:04,002
Be careful.
