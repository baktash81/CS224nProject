00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:48,084
"For heroism above
and beyond the call of duty.

2
00:00:49,013 --> 00:00:52,369
For successfully infiltrating
the enemy's ranks. . .

3
00:00:53,613 --> 00:00:57,811
. . .and securing victory independently,
with cunning and honor. "

(CANNONS BOOMING)

5
00:01:00,813 --> 00:01:02,451
Captain John Boyd.

6
00:01:10,253 --> 00:01:12,209
SLAUSON: Amen.
MEN: Amen.

7
00:02:01,973 --> 00:02:03,929
SLAUSON:
You're no hero, Boyd.

8
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:07,725
I want you as far from my company
as possible.

9
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:10,367
I'm sending you to California.

10
00:02:10,693 --> 00:02:12,570
Fort Spencer.

11
00:02:13,253 --> 00:02:15,130
Please, gentlemen, quickly.

12
00:02:15,773 --> 00:02:18,970
I want all of that in the largest
office on the left.

13
00:02:19,893 --> 00:02:22,202
Careful. Don't scratch it.

14
00:02:23,453 --> 00:02:25,091
Come, come, come.

15
00:05:30,453 --> 00:05:33,809
SOLDIER'S VOICE:
Lieutenant Boyd! Lieutenant Boyd!

16
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:37,407
Lieutenant Boyd!

17
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:40,930
(SCREAMING)

18
00:05:52,173 --> 00:05:53,492
Boyd!

19
00:05:53,693 --> 00:05:55,126
Boyd!

20
00:05:57,613 --> 00:05:59,126
Help me!

21
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:05,649
Captain John Boyd.

22
00:06:08,013 --> 00:06:09,366
War hero, huh?

23
00:06:11,453 --> 00:06:14,172
So the brass decided to reward you. . .

24
00:06:14,973 --> 00:06:17,726
. . .with a little appointment
to the California sun?

25
00:06:21,373 --> 00:06:23,011
Have a walnut, Boyd.

26
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:27,085
Martha brought them in fresh
from San Miguel.

27
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:29,851
This is my hobby.

28
00:06:30,693 --> 00:06:34,049
Reading in the original languages.

29
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:37,653
Well, you know, languages in general.

30
00:06:41,013 --> 00:06:43,163
It's tedious, I know. . .

31
00:06:43,373 --> 00:06:46,683
. . .but then this place thrives
on tedium.

32
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:53,246
So. . . .

33
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,608
You have a hobby, Boyd?

34
00:07:00,693 --> 00:07:02,012
Swimming.

35
00:07:03,853 --> 00:07:05,081
Swimming.

36
00:07:05,853 --> 00:07:08,321
I hope you don't mind hard water.

37
00:07:11,373 --> 00:07:13,045
Fort Spencer.

38
00:07:14,693 --> 00:07:16,843
The Spanish built this place
as a mission.

39
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:19,728
We inherited her. Now we're
a weigh station. . .

40
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:22,447
. . .for travelers on their way
through the Nevadas.

41
00:07:22,893 --> 00:07:25,361
We don't get much traffic
here in the winter. . .

42
00:07:25,573 --> 00:07:29,691
. . .so we maintain a skeleton company
that consists of Private Toffler. . .

43
00:07:29,893 --> 00:07:32,168
. . .who's our personal emissary
from the Lord.

44
00:07:32,373 --> 00:07:35,206
Major Knox, who never met a bottle
he didn't like.

45
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,007
Private Reich, he's our soldier.

46
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:42,609
I'd steer clear of him.

47
00:07:42,813 --> 00:07:46,852
And Martha, you've met. I bet you
didn't get a word out of her.

48
00:07:47,053 --> 00:07:48,645
And George, her brother.

49
00:07:48,853 --> 00:07:52,402
They're both locals and sort of
came with the place.

50
00:07:53,853 --> 00:07:56,765
And then there's Private Cleaves.

51
00:07:58,093 --> 00:08:00,971
The over-medicated Private Cleaves.

52
00:08:01,173 --> 00:08:03,368
And you and I make eight.

53
00:08:03,613 --> 00:08:06,969
Cleaves cooks. Knox used to be
a veterinarian, so he plays doctor.

54
00:08:07,173 --> 00:08:09,562
My advice to you is, don't get sick.

55
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:12,727
I'd say don't eat,
but then most of us have to.

56
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:15,925
So with your promotion, you'd be
number three in command.

57
00:08:20,813 --> 00:08:22,690
Toffler's prayer.

58
00:08:27,813 --> 00:08:30,611
O, Heavenly Father,
bless these to our use. . . .

59
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:34,003
-Amen.
-Amen.

60
00:08:34,373 --> 00:08:37,683
So, did anyone do anything today?

61
00:08:46,813 --> 00:08:49,930
We have a great sense of camaraderie
here at Fort Spencer.

62
00:09:21,213 --> 00:09:23,283
MAN 1 :
How'd you get behind the enemy line?

63
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:25,405
BOYD:
I froze. I was scared.

64
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:27,881
MAN 1 :
Scared?

65
00:09:28,293 --> 00:09:31,205
You froze while the rest
of your unit fought...

66
00:09:31,413 --> 00:09:33,005
...and died?

67
00:09:37,653 --> 00:09:39,564
MAN 2:
What did you do then?

68
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,130
BOYD:
I played dead.

69
00:09:44,973 --> 00:09:47,441
MAN 1 :
But you made it behind enemy lines.

70
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:50,851
BOYD:
I was buried...

71
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:58,410
... with my commanding officer's
half-shot-off head in my face.

72
00:10:00,053 --> 00:10:02,044
His blood running down my throat.

73
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,164
(COUGHS)

74
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:08,088
MAN 2:
So how did you take the command post?

75
00:10:10,853 --> 00:10:12,366
BOYD:
Something....

76
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,202
Something had changed.

77
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:35,932
(GUNFIRE)

78
00:10:36,173 --> 00:10:38,004
(MEN SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

79
00:10:46,893 --> 00:10:50,329
MAN 2: We're gonna promote you, Boyd.
We could shoot you...

80
00:10:50,573 --> 00:10:54,851
...but as you captured the enemy
command, it might set a bad precedent.

81
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,841
HART:
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

82
00:10:58,253 --> 00:11:00,608
Last-minute addition to the post.

83
00:11:00,853 --> 00:11:02,923
All right, Cleaves. Let's hear it.

84
00:11:04,013 --> 00:11:07,403
Salt, meat, beans, coffee. . .

85
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:10,571
. . .oil, bacon, flour.

86
00:11:10,773 --> 00:11:13,333
All right. Now, I want you back
in three days.

87
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,606
No local weed.

88
00:11:15,813 --> 00:11:17,644
No peyote.

89
00:11:17,853 --> 00:11:20,162
-No women.
-No women.

90
00:11:20,693 --> 00:11:22,285
Martha, keep him out of trouble.

91
00:11:23,893 --> 00:11:25,326
Okay, have a nice trip.

92
00:11:28,893 --> 00:11:29,848
Come on.

93
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,365
We'll pick up some salt. . .

94
00:11:34,613 --> 00:11:37,923
. . .meat, beans, local weeds, women.

95
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:40,408
MARTHA: No women.
CLEAVES: I can't get a woman if l. . . .

96
00:11:40,653 --> 00:11:42,928
Wish you were along for the ride?

97
00:11:53,573 --> 00:11:55,803
What did you get the medal for?

98
00:11:58,933 --> 00:12:00,366
Cowardice.

99
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:08,251
Knox has got some excellent bourbon.
It's really fine stuff.

100
00:12:08,453 --> 00:12:10,728
And he just passed out about. . .

101
00:12:11,293 --> 00:12:12,408
. . .a minute ago.

102
00:12:12,653 --> 00:12:15,406
So I'm wondering if you
would like to. . .?

103
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:18,647
-He won't mind?
-Probably.

104
00:12:19,933 --> 00:12:21,161
To escape.

105
00:12:21,973 --> 00:12:23,770
In one form or another.

106
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:28,412
Toffler.

107
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:30,327
Toffler!

108
00:12:33,373 --> 00:12:34,726
What are you doing?

109
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,692
It's a religious hymn.

110
00:12:38,373 --> 00:12:41,092
I'm writing a religious hymn.

111
00:12:43,173 --> 00:12:46,483
Well, could you find some inspiration
somewhere else?

112
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:49,008
And could you get us some ice?

113
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:02,566
Funny thing.

114
00:13:03,573 --> 00:13:05,325
We escape the world.

115
00:13:05,573 --> 00:13:07,086
We come here. . .

116
00:13:07,293 --> 00:13:10,649
. . .and then we turn right around
and try to escape this place.

117
00:13:14,453 --> 00:13:16,364
The frightening thing
about escape, though. . .

118
00:13:16,613 --> 00:13:18,922
. . .the chance you might end up
someplace worse.

119
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,482
He was here.

120
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:31,371
Reich, go that way.

121
00:13:31,613 --> 00:13:33,251
-Colonel?
-Yeah.

122
00:13:35,853 --> 00:13:37,002
Who are you?

123
00:13:38,453 --> 00:13:40,603
Reich! Reich!

124
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:43,081
-He's alive.
REICH: Jesus Christ!

125
00:13:43,293 --> 00:13:45,488
HART: Just barely.
Let's get him inside.

126
00:13:46,813 --> 00:13:49,805
We need hot water.
George, Toffler, hot water.

127
00:13:50,013 --> 00:13:52,243
Lots of hot water.
Reich, go rouse Knox.

128
00:13:52,453 --> 00:13:54,523
Let's get those rags off him.

129
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,008
See if we can get his blood moving.

130
00:14:00,213 --> 00:14:01,612
Toffler, more water.

131
00:14:06,693 --> 00:14:07,762
HART:
I think he'll live.

132
00:14:09,573 --> 00:14:12,485
Easy, easy, easy. Blanket.

133
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,922
Well, he's warm.

134
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,563
Frostbite didn't seem
to do much damage.

135
00:14:29,893 --> 00:14:32,691
I guess the only thing we can do
is let him rest.

136
00:14:34,613 --> 00:14:37,969
And pray. Toffler, your duty.

137
00:14:38,373 --> 00:14:39,726
Good work.

138
00:14:50,293 --> 00:14:54,081
Each one of these squares
is 1 mile by 1 .5 miles.

139
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,648
It takes about three days, actually--

140
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:01,682
Yes?

141
00:15:01,893 --> 00:15:04,202
He's up. Excellent.

142
00:15:04,893 --> 00:15:06,645
He's up. Let's go.

143
00:15:09,173 --> 00:15:10,447
Major Knox?

144
00:15:11,613 --> 00:15:12,887
Major Knox?

145
00:15:16,773 --> 00:15:19,082
Doc? Doc?

146
00:15:24,053 --> 00:15:25,247
Doc, he's awake.

147
00:15:25,453 --> 00:15:26,602
What? Who?

148
00:15:26,813 --> 00:15:28,804
The man who showed up last night.

149
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:31,971
He's gonna tell us what happened.

150
00:15:32,893 --> 00:15:34,770
(SNORES)

151
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:38,132
Where?

152
00:15:41,093 --> 00:15:41,889
Where am l?

153
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:44,763
Fort Spencer, California.

154
00:15:45,093 --> 00:15:47,129
Western Sierra Nevadas.

155
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,925
Excuse me.

156
00:15:57,693 --> 00:15:58,842
I'm sorry.

157
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:02,930
My name's Colqhoun.

158
00:16:05,053 --> 00:16:07,647
F.W. Colqhoun, servant of God.

159
00:16:09,493 --> 00:16:11,484
How are you feeling, Mr. Colqhoun?

160
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:14,844
Not bad, considering.

161
00:16:16,093 --> 00:16:17,731
Probably look like death.

162
00:16:17,973 --> 00:16:20,407
HART:
Not bad, considering.

163
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:23,132
How long were you out there?

164
00:16:24,773 --> 00:16:26,252
Three months.

165
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,887
-Without food?
-Yes.

166
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:34,408
-Toffler, help him.
COLQHOUN: Good Lord.

167
00:16:35,693 --> 00:16:37,604
Good Lord.

168
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:40,043
You should have seen me
three months ago.

169
00:16:42,853 --> 00:16:44,366
I was 30 pounds heavier.

170
00:16:44,973 --> 00:16:48,852
I'm sorry, but you did say
no food for three months?

171
00:16:52,733 --> 00:16:56,567
I said no food. I didn't say
there was nothing to eat. Understand?

172
00:16:57,813 --> 00:16:59,166
Do you understand?

173
00:17:01,573 --> 00:17:03,564
I suppose I owe you gentlemen a story.

174
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,128
HART:
Only if you feel up to it.

175
00:17:07,013 --> 00:17:08,207
Yes.

176
00:17:19,653 --> 00:17:21,371
We left in April.

177
00:17:23,093 --> 00:17:24,845
Six of us in all.

178
00:17:26,773 --> 00:17:30,846
Mr. MacCready and his wife
from lreland.

179
00:17:31,053 --> 00:17:34,204
Mr. Janus, from Virginia, I believe...

180
00:17:34,413 --> 00:17:36,802
... with his servant, Jones.

181
00:17:37,013 --> 00:17:40,369
Myself, I'm from Scotland.

182
00:17:41,813 --> 00:17:43,166
And our guide. . .

183
00:17:46,253 --> 00:17:49,484
. . .a military man, coincidentally.
A Colonel lves.

184
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:51,605
I don't think I know him.

185
00:17:52,653 --> 00:17:54,086
The better for you.

186
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,725
A detestable man.

187
00:17:58,133 --> 00:18:00,169
The most disastrous guide.

188
00:18:01,853 --> 00:18:04,162
He professed to know. . .

189
00:18:04,373 --> 00:18:07,410
. . .a new, shorter route
through the Nevadas.

190
00:18:09,093 --> 00:18:10,845
Quite a route that was.

191
00:18:11,253 --> 00:18:13,084
Longer than the known one...

192
00:18:14,453 --> 00:18:16,489
...and impossible to travel.

193
00:18:17,773 --> 00:18:19,809
We worked very, very hard.

194
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:26,843
By the first snow, we were 1 00 miles
from this place. That was November.

195
00:18:28,013 --> 00:18:30,732
Proceeding in the snow was futile.

196
00:18:31,613 --> 00:18:33,444
We took shelter in a cave.

197
00:18:34,093 --> 00:18:37,165
Decided to wait until
the storm had passed.

198
00:18:37,693 --> 00:18:39,604
But the storm did not pass.

199
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:44,051
The trail soon became impassable...

200
00:18:46,373 --> 00:18:48,250
. . .and we had run out of food.

201
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:52,452
We ate the oxen. . .

202
00:18:54,253 --> 00:18:55,891
. . .all the horses. . .

203
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,691
. . .even my own dog.

204
00:19:01,653 --> 00:19:03,564
And that lasted us about a month.

205
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:08,641
After that we turned to our belts.

206
00:19:09,373 --> 00:19:10,772
Shoes.

207
00:19:10,973 --> 00:19:13,851
Any roots we could dig up,
but you know. . .

208
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:16,328
. . .there's no real
nourishment in those.

209
00:19:19,013 --> 00:19:21,083
We remained famished.

210
00:19:22,973 --> 00:19:26,886
The day that Jones died,
I was out collecting wood.

211
00:19:28,573 --> 00:19:30,882
He had expired from malnourishment.

212
00:19:33,013 --> 00:19:36,369
When I returned, the others were
cooking his legs for dinner.

213
00:19:42,373 --> 00:19:44,728
Would I have stopped it
had I been there?

214
00:19:48,693 --> 00:19:49,842
I don't know.

215
00:19:52,253 --> 00:19:53,971
But I must say. . .

216
00:19:55,613 --> 00:19:58,127
. . .when I stepped inside that cave. . .

217
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:04,963
. . .the smell of meat cooking. . . .

218
00:20:09,853 --> 00:20:11,571
I thanked the Lord.

219
00:20:12,813 --> 00:20:14,451
I thanked the Lord.

220
00:20:21,133 --> 00:20:23,408
And then things got out of hand.

221
00:20:25,293 --> 00:20:27,249
I ate sparingly.

222
00:20:28,693 --> 00:20:30,206
Others did not.

223
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:35,249
The meat did not last us a week,
and we were soon hungry again.

224
00:20:35,453 --> 00:20:37,842
Only this time our hunger
was different.

225
00:20:39,293 --> 00:20:42,808
More severe.

226
00:20:44,933 --> 00:20:46,366
Savage.

227
00:20:47,453 --> 00:20:51,128
And Colonel lves, particularly,
could not be satisfied.

228
00:20:54,973 --> 00:20:57,328
Janus was the first to be killed.

229
00:21:00,813 --> 00:21:02,485
And then Mr. MacCready.

230
00:21:03,413 --> 00:21:07,770
That left Colonel lves,
MacCready's wife and I alone.

231
00:21:07,973 --> 00:21:11,124
And I knew in that company
that my days were numbered.

232
00:21:13,853 --> 00:21:17,562
I'm ashamed to say that I acted
in a most cowardly manner.

233
00:21:20,293 --> 00:21:24,684
It would've been nobler to stay and
protect Mrs. MacCready from lves. . .

234
00:21:26,573 --> 00:21:27,892
. . .but I was weak.

235
00:21:31,453 --> 00:21:32,772
I fled.

236
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:39,689
It was nothing less than pure
providence that I arrived here.

237
00:21:39,893 --> 00:21:42,965
Mrs. MacCready, is she still there?

238
00:21:43,173 --> 00:21:44,925
And Colonel lves, as far as I know.

239
00:21:45,133 --> 00:21:45,929
Let's pack up.

00:21:46,133 --> 00:21:48,852

Consequently, I ate the scout first,
and he was absolutely right.

01:12:40,513 --> 01:12:41,912
You killed Cleaves. . .

722
01:12:43,073 --> 01:12:44,472
. . .and the horses.

723
01:12:47,473 --> 01:12:48,826
What happened to you?

724
01:12:53,593 --> 01:12:55,265
I thought I was dead.

725
01:12:56,233 --> 01:13:00,465
I remember feeling panic
as my life slipped away.

726
01:13:01,993 --> 01:13:04,712
It was like drowning in darkness,
and then. . .

727
01:13:04,913 --> 01:13:06,392
. . .there was nothing.

728
01:13:08,433 --> 01:13:10,230
And then I woke up.

729
01:13:10,913 --> 01:13:11,982
Ives was feeding me.

730
01:13:13,113 --> 01:13:16,469
By the time I regained my senses,
there was no turning back.

731
01:13:18,073 --> 01:13:19,665
I feel terrific.

732
01:13:20,953 --> 01:13:23,262
-So you're gonna kill me?
-No.

733
01:13:24,473 --> 01:13:26,191
It's lonely being a cannibal.

734
01:13:26,393 --> 01:13:28,190
Tough making friends.

735
01:13:29,233 --> 01:13:30,905
I like you, Boyd.

736

746
01:14:05,353 --> 01:14:06,786
You know, come April. . .

747
01:14:07,833 --> 01:14:09,186

748

No.

754

Selectively.

755
01:14:37,393 --> 01:14:38,542
Good God!

756
01:14:39,673 --> 01:14:41,106
We don't want to break up families.

01:14:41,713 --> 01:14:43,544
-People aren't stupid, lves.
-Really?

758
01:14:44,513 --> 01:14:47,710
-You'll get caught.
-Well, if it's just the two of us.

759
01:14:49,873 --> 01:14:51,909
Jolly old Hart and l.

760
01:14:54,353 --> 01:14:56,309
You see, that's why we need others.

761
01:14:58,193 --> 01:14:59,512
You, for one.

762
01:15:01,593 --> 01:15:03,026
General Slauson.

763
01:15:04,313 --> 01:15:07,988
We don't wish to recruit everyone.
We have enough mouths to feed.

764
01:15:10,393 --> 01:15:11,906
We just need a home.

765
01:15:12,673 --> 01:15:14,106
And this country. . .

766
01:15:14,793 --> 01:15:16,511
. . .is seeking to be whole.

767
01:15:18,753 --> 01:15:20,983
Stretching out its arms. . .

768
01:15:21,513 --> 01:15:23,390
. . .and consuming all it can.

769
01:15:26,913 --> 01:15:28,505
And we merely follow.

770
01:15:30,753 --> 01:15:31,868
Not me.

771
01:15:35,393 --> 01:15:37,907
You know, it's not courage
to resist me, Boyd.

772
01:15:39,513 --> 01:15:41,504
It's courage to accept me.

773
01:15:44,473 --> 01:15:46,384
I mean, you're already one of us.

774
01:15:48,153 --> 01:15:49,108
Well. . .

776
01:15:52,553 --> 01:15:53,781
You hunger for it.

777
01:15:57,113 --> 01:15:59,263
You just won't resign yourself to it.

778
01:16:01,433 --> 01:16:03,708
It's not so difficult, really.

779
01:16:05,953 --> 01:16:07,068
Acquiescence.

780
01:16:09,073 --> 01:16:10,745
It's easy, actually.

781
01:16:14,433 --> 01:16:17,027
You just give in.

782
01:16:18,153 --> 01:16:19,222
I can't.

783
01:16:22,393 --> 01:16:23,746
Oh, well.

784
01:16:25,473 --> 01:16:26,588
Then. . .

785

786
01:16:34,553 --> 01:16:36,430
It's all right. It's not fatal.

A couple of doses of this, you'll be

"Eat to live.

Huh? Huh?

800
01:17:30,113 --> 01:17:32,422
Well, it's an easy decision, Boyd.

801
01:17:32,673 --> 01:17:35,392
You can either famine or feast.

802
01:17:36,313 --> 01:17:37,666
Live or die.

803
01:18:30,913 --> 01:18:31,902

Of course not.

Happiness, and how to achieve it.

827
01:20:48,993 --> 01:20:50,870
Aristotle sought truth,
not happiness.

828
01:20:51,193 --> 01:20:52,467
Truth?

829
01:20:53,593 --> 01:20:56,903

You have to do me a favor

01:22:19,793 --> 01:22:21,511
You have to kill me.
