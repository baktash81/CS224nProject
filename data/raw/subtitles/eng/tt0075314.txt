1
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,720
Harry, answer that.

2
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,930
So, what do you wanna
hack for, Bickle?

3
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,600
I can't sleep nights.

4
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:41,560
-There's porno theatres for that.
-Yeah, I know. I tried that.

5
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,860
So, what do you do now?

6
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:51,950
Now? Ride around nights mostly.
Subways, buses.

7
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,080
Figure l'm gonna do that,
I might as well get paid for it.

8
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,620
You wanna work uptown?
South Bronx, Harlem?

9
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,540
I'll work anytime, anywhere.

10
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,210
Will you work Jewish holidays?

11
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,130
Anytime, anywhere.

12
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,760
All right.
Let me see your chauffeur's licence.

13
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,800
-How's your driving record?
-lt's clean.

14
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,180
It's real clean, like my conscience.

15
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:17,180
You gonna break my chops? l got
enough trouble with guys like you.

16
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,770
If you're gonna break my chops,
you can take it on the arches.

17
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,360
Sorry, sir, I didn't mean that.

18
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,730
-Physical?
-Clean.

19
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,740
-Age?
-Twenty-six.

20
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,650
Education?

21
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,320
Some.

22
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,620
Here, there, you know.

23
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,910
Military record?

24
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,330
Honourable discharge.

25
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,840
May 1 973.

26
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,050
-Were you in the Army?
-Marines.

27
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,300
I was in the Marines too.

28
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,680
So, what is it?

29
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,970
You need an extra job?

30
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,480
Are you moonlighting?

31
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,480
Well, l--
I just wanna work long hours.

32
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,150
What's moonlighting?

33
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,490
Look, just fill out these forms
and check back tomorrow...

34
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,650
...when the shift breaks.

35
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,490
O'Brien, please step up.

36
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,240
Take the car out
through 58th Street, please.

37
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,290
Because it's crowded on 57th.

38
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,960
Hey, Rodriguez!

39
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,970
All right, all right,
I'm coming down there.

40
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,550
May 1 0th.

41
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,010
Thank God for the rain,
which has washed away...

42
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,520
...the garbage and the trash
off the sidewalks.

43
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,310
I'm working long hours now.

44
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,310
Six in the afternoon to 6 in the morning,
sometimes even 8 in the morning.

45
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,650
Six days a week,
sometimes seven days a week.

46
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,780
It's a long hustle,
but it keeps me real busy.

47
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,240
I can take in $300,
$350 a week.

48
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,030
Sometimes even more
when l do it off the meter.

49
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,480
All the animals come out at night.

50
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:12,730
Whores, skunk-pussies, buggers,
queens, fairies, dopers, junkies.

51
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,900
Sick, venal.

52
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,490
Someday a real rain'll come and
wash all this scum off the streets.

53
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,460
I go all over. l take people to the
Bronx, Brooklyn. l take them to Harlem.

54
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,630
I don't care.
Don't make no difference to me.

55
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,430
It does to some.
Some won't even take spooks.

56
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,220
Don't make no difference to me.

57
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,060
Driver, 48th and 6th, please.

58
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,350
Man, you are gorgeous!
Beautiful little girl.

59
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,150
I can't afford
to get stopped anywhere.

60
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,530
Oh, no.
We wouldn't want that to happen.

61
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,450
There'll be a big tip in it for you,
you do the right things.

62
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,240
You got a way.

63
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,910
Yeah. Now you're talking!

64
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,630
Driver, hurry up, will you?

65
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,330
Each night when l return the cab...

66
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,380
...I have to clean the come
off the back seat.

67
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,680
Some nights, l clean off the blood.

68
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,540
Can l help you?

69
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,800
Yeah, what's your name?

70
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,380
My name is Travis.

71
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,380
That's nice.
What can I do for you?

72
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,430
I'd like to know what your name is.
What's your name?

73
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,680
Give me a break.

74
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,810
Look, you can tell me what your
name is. l'm not gonna do anything.

75
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,650
-Do you want me to call the manager?
-You don't have to call the manager.

76
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,320
-Troy!
-All right. Okay, l mean....

77
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,700
Okay. Can l have a Chuckles there?

78
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,990
And do you have any Jujubes? They
last longer. I'd like to get some Jujubes.

79
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,410
What you see is what we got.

80
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,090
A Clark.

81
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,050
I'll take these.

82
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,890
Coca-Cola.

83
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,970
We don't have Coca-Cola.
Royal Crown Cola is all we got.

84
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,310
A dollar eighty-five.

85
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,750
Twelve hours of work
and l still can't sleep.

86
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,880
Damn.

87
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:07,180
The days go on and on.
And they don't end.

88
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,060
All my life needed was
a sense of some place to go.

89
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:16,640
I don't believe that one should devote
his life to morbid self-attention.

90
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,190
I believe that someone should
become a person like other people.

91
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:27,490
I first saw her at Palantine campaign
headquarters at 63rd and Broadway.

92
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,450
She was wearing a white dress.

93
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,120
She appeared like an angel...

94
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,250
...out of this filthy mass.

95
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,330
She is alone.

96
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,040
They...

97
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,920
...cannot...

98
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,800
...touch...

99
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,880
...her.

100
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:02,270
Yes. Well, you delivered two boxes.

101
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,230
I think it's a total
of 5000 campaign buttons.

102
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,780
Now, all the ones we had before
and our slogan is:

103
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,700
"We are the people,"
and "are" is underlined.

104
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,410
These new buttons
have "we" underlined.

105
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:19,210
That reads, "We are the people."
Well, l think there's a difference.

106
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,340
"We are the people" is not
the same as "We are the people."

107
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,630
Let's not fight.

108
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,550
Look, we'll make it real simple.

109
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,880
We don't pay for the buttons.

110
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,430
-We throw the buttons away, all right?
-Tom, come here a minute.

111
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,350
What?

112
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,070
What is it?

113
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:50,650
If Andy okays this canvass report,
send a copy to all headquarters.

114
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,160
I gotta get that New York Times article
xeroxed.

115
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,910
-Don't forget the new photos.
-l didn't forget.

116
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,370
We have to emphasise mandatory
welfare. That's the issue to push.

117
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,460
First push the man, then the issue.

118
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,670
Senator Palantine is a dynamic man.

119
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,920
An intelligent, interesting,
fresh, fascinating man.

120
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,300
You forgot sexy.

121
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,880
I did not forget sexy.

122
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,720
Listen to you. You sound
like you're selling mouthwash.

123
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,100
We are selling mouthwash.

124
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,260
-Are we authorized to do that?
-Very funny.

125
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:20,680
You can get in trouble selling
pharmaceuticals in a campaign office.

126
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,400
My uncle's in jail because of that.

127
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:27,730
It's not really jail. Of course, living
with his wife, anything would be jail.

128
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,230
Look over there.

129
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,690
I love you.

130
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,030
Notice anything?

131
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,450
-No.
-Well, put your glasses on.

132
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,240
Okay, just a minute. All right.

133
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,750
That taxi driver's been staring at us.

134
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,300
What taxi driver?

135
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,630
That one, the one that's sitting there.

136
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,220
-How long has he been there?
-l don't know. It feels like a long time.

137
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,260
-Does he bother you?
-No.

138
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,560
You mean yes,
and you're being sarcastic.

139
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,640
Oh, you're quick.
You're really quick.

140
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,400
Well, l try to be real quick.

141
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,860
I'll play the male
in this relationship--

142
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,320
Good luck.

143
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:12,860
--and tell him to move. And l don't
need good luck. Thank you.

144
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,820
Oh, yes, you do.
You just think you don't.

145
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,830
Say, you're blocking our doorway.
You think you might move your cab?

146
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,270
You know, eye shadow, mascara...

147
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:12,980
...lipstick, rouge.

148
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:16,070
Not rouge. Blush-on, they call it.

149
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,660
-The kind with the brush.
-Yeah, it's Blush-on.

150
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,530
Travis.

151
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,540
-Hey, Wiz.
-That's Blush-on. My wife uses it.

152
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,830
Ask Travis. He's a ladies' man.

153
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,460
A cup of coffee, please.

154
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,460
Anyway, whatever the fuck it is,
she uses a lot of it.

155
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,090
And then perfume. The spray kind.

156
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,800
Get this. ln the middle
of the Triborough Bridge--

157
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:44,220
And this woman is beautiful.
--she changes her pantyhose.

158
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,720
-No.
-Oh, yeah.

159
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,020
-What'd you do?
-l throw the meter, you know...

160
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:53,610
...and l jump in the back seat and whip
it out. l said, "You know what this is?"

161
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,610
She says, "lt's love."
I'm gonna fuck her brains out.

162
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,440
She goes wild and she said:

163
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,360
"That's the greatest
single experience of my life."

164
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,120
Then she gave me a $200 tip
and her phone number in Acapulco.

165
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,620
Travis, you know Doughboy,
Charlie T.?

166
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,040
Hey, Travis.
Got change for a nickel?

167
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,630
Doughboy'll do anything for a buck.

168
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,880
So how's it hanging?

169
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,510
What's that?

170
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:32,390
I turn on the radio. Some fleet driver
from Bell just got all cut up.

171
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,690
Stickup?

172
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,610
No, he got cut up by some
crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.

173
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,440
-Where?
-lt was at 122nd Street.

174
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,030
Fucking Mau Mau land.

175
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,330
You run all over town,
don't you, Travis?

176
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,790
Travis?

177
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,550
Travis.

178
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,720
-You run all over town, don't you?
-Yeah.

179
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,260
You handle some
pretty rough customers, huh?

180
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,010
Yeah, l have.

181
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:10,470
-You carry a piece?
-No.

182
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,770
-You need one?
-No.

183
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,190
I know a fella who can get you
a real nice deal.

184
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,270
There's lots of shit around.

185
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,940
I never use mine.
I'm conservative, you know.

186
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,030
But it's a good thing to have
just as a threat.

187
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,290
I'm gonna go dig my dirt.

188
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,170
Travis.

189
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,920
Look.

190
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,260
Piece of Errol Flynn's bathtub.

191
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,390
Dig the symbols.

192
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,430
F-4-0-5-4-3-4.

193
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,440
And the watermark.

194
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,360
There's one person...

195
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,230
...there's two persons...

196
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,940
...and there's three persons.

197
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,360
I got this at his estate, The Pines.

198
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,820
Why don't you take it,
and if you can sell it...

199
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,830
-...you give me half of what you got.
-l don't want to.

200
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,750
Hey, I'm gonna get in my cab
and boogie.

201
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,180
-Oh, I'm so terribly sorry.
-Well....

202
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,230
-Nothing.
-That's very cute. Thank you.

203
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,310
Hey, you wanna see something?

204
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,060
Wait, l just typed,
"You wanna see something?"

205
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,070
-What?
-lf you had...

206
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,530
...these three fingers
missing on this hand...

207
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,990
...and that hand missing
on that hand...

208
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,870
-...how would you light the match?
-l wouldn't.

209
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,250
Go ahead. Give it a try.

210
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,210
Well, l don't think I could do it.

211
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,710
No?

212
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,590
It's gonna be difficult.

213
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,630
I'll give it a try.

214
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,470
I got my thumb back for a second.
Thank God.

215
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,180
Just a minute.

216
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,240
I can't do it.

217
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,490
The guy at the newsstand can do it.

218
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,740
Well, l don't work at a newsstand.

219
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,990
-Anyway, he's probably Italian.
-No.

220
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,790
-You're sure?
-He's black.

221
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,330
If he had been ltalian, he might've been
a thief. The mob does that.

222
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:44,170
If a thief screws up on the job,
they'll blow his fingers off.

223
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,920
This sounds like a joke,
but it's true.

224
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:50,300
If they kill a stool pigeon,
they leave a canary on the body.

225
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,800
-lt's symbolic.
-Why not a pigeon instead of a canary?

226
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,720
I don't know why not a pigeon.
Wait a minute.

227
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:00,810
You gotta catch a pigeon. A canary,
you can walk into a pet store...

228
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,810
...boom, kill it right there.
Put it on anyone you want.

229
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,140
-Hi. I'd like to volunteer.
-Great. l'll take you right over here.

230
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:37,010
I'd rather volunteer to her,
if you don't mind.

231
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:43,100
Why do you feel
you have to volunteer to me?

232
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:47,440
Because I think that you are the most
beautiful woman I have ever seen.

233
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,240
Thanks.

234
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,700
But what do you think of Palantine?

235
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,910
Well, l....

236
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,370
Palantine, the man you're volunteering
to help elect president.

237
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,790
I'm sure he'll make a good president.

238
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,380
I don't know what his policies are,
but I'm sure he'll make a good one.

239
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,470
-You wanna canvass?
-Yeah, I'll canvass.

240
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,260
How do you feel about
the senator's stand on welfare?

241
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:20,930
I don't really know his stand on
welfare, but l'm sure it's a good stand.

242
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,060
-You're sure of that?
-Yeah.

243
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,730
We all work together here,
day and night...

244
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,110
...so l'm sure the gentlemen
will sign you up over there.

245
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,870
The thing is, l drive a taxi at night,
so it's kind of hard for me...

246
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,240
...to work in the day.

247
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,500
Then what exactly do you want?

248
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,460
Would you like to come have
some coffee and pie with me?

249
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:46,920
Why?

250
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,340
-Why? l'll tell you why.
-Yeah.

251
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,630
I think you're a lonely person.

252
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:55,470
I drive by a lot, and I see you here.

253
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,680
I see a lot of people around you...

254
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,970
...and l see these phones
and all this stuff on your desk...

255
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,520
...that means nothing.

256
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,850
And when I came inside and met you...

257
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,810
...l saw in your eyes
and how you carried yourself...

258
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,230
...that you're not a happy person.

259
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,610
And l think you need something.

260
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,700
And if you wanna call it a friend,
you can call it a friend.

261
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:19,990
-You're gonna be my friend?
-Yeah.

262
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,380
What do you say?

263
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:37,220
It's a little hard standing here
and asking you, so....

264
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:45,180
Five minutes, that's all.
Just outside. Right around here.

265
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,100
I'm there to protect you.

266
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,440
Come on. Just take a little break.

267
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,700
I have a break at 4:00.
And if you're here--

268
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,950
-4:00 today?
-Yes.

269
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,080
-l'll be here.
-l'm sure you will.

270
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,210
-All right, 4 p.m.
-Right.

271
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,250
-Outside in the front?
-Yes.

272
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,670
Okay.

273
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,300
Oh, my name is Travis. Betsy?

274
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,130
Travis.

275
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,890
I appreciate this, Betsy.

276
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:37,820
May 26th, 4:00 p.m.

277
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:41,950
I took Betsy to Charles' Coffee Shop
on Columbus Circle.

278
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:47,580
I had black coffee and apple pie
with a slice of melted yellow cheese.

279
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,040
I think that was a good selection.

280
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,580
Betsy had coffee
and a fruit salad dish.

281
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,710
She could've had
anything she wanted.

282
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,630
Fifteen thousand volunteers
in New York alone's not bad.

283
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,670
But the organizational problems.

284
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,800
Yeah, l know what you mean.
I got the same problems.

285
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:10,100
I gotta get organized. Little things,
like my apartment, my possessions.

286
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,730
I should get one of those signs: "One
of these days, l'll get organiz-ized."

287
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,610
You mean "organized"?

288
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,690
Organiz-ized.

289
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,360
Organiz-ized. It's a joke.

290
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,820
O-R-G-A-N-E-Z-I-E-Z-D.

291
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,330
You mean "organiz-ize." Like those
little signs in offices that say, "Thimk."

292
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,920
Do you like where you work?

293
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:42,260
We've got some good people. And
I think Palantine's got a good chance.

294
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,470
You know you have beautiful eyes?

295
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,150
Do you like the guy you work with?

296
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,980
He's okay.

297
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,240
Yeah, l know.
But do you like him?

298
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:07,200
He's funny, good at his job. He's okay.
Though he does have a few problems.

299
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,580
I would say
he has quite a few problems.

300
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:14,370
His energy seems to go
in the wrong places.

301
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,790
When I walked in and I saw
you two sitting there...

302
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,880
...l could just tell
that there was no connection...

303
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,470
...whatsoever.

304
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,930
And l felt when I walked in,
there was something between us.

305
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,850
There was an impulse
that we were both following.

306
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,770
So that gave me the right
to talk to you.

307
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,730
Otherwise, l never would've felt
that I had the right to talk to you.

308
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,940
I never would've had
the courage to talk to you.

309
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,320
And with him,
I felt there was nothing.

310
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:45,610
When I walked in, I knew l was right.
Did you feel that way?

311
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,490
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

312
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,080
Where are you from?

313
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,790
Upstate.

314
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,510
That fellow, l don't like him.

315
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:05,720
Not that l don't like him,
I just think he's silly.

316
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,430
I don't think he respects you.

317
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,680
I don't believe l've ever met
anyone quite like you.

318
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,740
You wanna go to...

319
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,740
...a movie with me?

320
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:35,250
-l have to go back to work now.
-l don't mean now. Another time?

321
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:44,210
Sure.
You know what you remind me of?

322
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,550
-What?
-That song...

323
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,800
...by Kris Kristofferson.

324
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:57,390
-Who's that?
-The songwriter.

325
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,150
"He's a prophet....

326
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,110
He's a prophet and a pusher...

327
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,360
...partly truth, partly fiction,
a walking contradiction."

328
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,450
You saying that about me?

329
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,360
Who else would l be talking about?

330
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,660
I'm no pusher.
I've never pushed.

331
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,580
No, just the part
about the contradictions.

332
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,620
You are that.

333
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,030
I called Betsy again at her office.
She said maybe we'd go to a movie...

334
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,160
...after work tomorrow.
That's my day off.

335
00:27:56,410 --> 00:28:00,540
At first she hesitated,
but I called her again and she agreed.

336
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,710
Betsy, Betsy. Oh, no.

337
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,630
Betsy what?
I forgot to ask her last name.

338
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,130
Damn! l gotta remember
stuff like that.

339
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,980
Don't worry about anyone
committing themselves...

340
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:26,860
...until things start coming in
from California.

341
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,990
Listen, l think we should've
waited for the limo.

342
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,990
I don't mind the cab,
but I mind...

343
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,990
...going to California without the right
preparation. That'll get us in trouble.

344
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,240
Are you Charles Palantine,
the candidate?

345
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,870
Yes, l am.

346
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,500
I'm a big supporter.

347
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:48,170
I tell everybody that comes in this taxi
they have to vote for you.

348
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,960
Why, thank you...

349
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,090
...Travis.

350
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,220
I'm sure you'll win.
Everybody l know's gonna vote for you.

351
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,850
I was gonna put one of
your stickers in my taxi...

352
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,980
...but the company said
it was against their policy.

353
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,810
They're a bunch ofjerks.

354
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,860
Let me tell you, l have learned
more about America...

355
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:10,280
...from riding in taxicabs than
in all the limos in the country.

356
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,990
-Oh, yeah?
-That's true.

357
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:18,030
-Can l ask you something, Travis?
-Sure.

358
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,410
What is the one thing about this
country that bugs you the most?

359
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,920
Well, l don't know. I don't follow
political issues that closely, sir.

360
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,630
Oh, well, there must be something.

361
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:35,010
Well, whatever it is, he should
clean up this city here...

362
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:39,720
...because this city here's like an
open sewer. lt's full of filth and scum.

363
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,020
Sometimes I can hardly take it.

364
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:45,230
Whatever ever becomes the president
should just...

365
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,980
...really clean it up.
Know what l mean?

366
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:51,860
Sometimes I go out and I smell it.
I get headaches, it's so bad.

367
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:55,150
And they just like-- They just
never go away, you know?

368
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:57,740
I think that the president
should just...

369
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,750
...clean up this mess. He should
flush it right down the fucking toilet.

370
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:13,380
Well, l think l know
what you mean, Travis.

371
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,630
But it's not gonna be easy.

372
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,300
-We'll have to make radical changes.
-Damn straight.

373
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,720
Here you go, Travis.
Keep the change.

374
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,230
Thank you.

375
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,770
-Nice talking to you.
-Nice talking to you.

376
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,360
You're a good man.
I know you're gonna win.

377
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,570
Thank you. Drive safe.

378
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,680
Come on, man.
Get me out of here, all right?

379
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,890
Come on!

380
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,390
Come on, baby.
This is a real drag.

381
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,230
Now, come on!
Come on, don't make no scene.

382
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,320
You wanna get busted?

383
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,820
Now, bitch, be cool!

384
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,790
Don't start no trouble.

385
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,960
Cabbie, forget about this.
It's nothing.

386
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,420
Be cool, bitch!

387
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,680
-Stop!
-Wanna hear something?

388
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,230
What's the matter, baby?

389
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,600
Get your ass out of here!

390
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,040
-Hi, there.
-Hi.

391
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,550
-Have a nice day today?
-Not particularly.

392
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,420
I got a present for you.

393
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,350
Now back to Gene Krupa's
syncopated style shortly.

394
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,730
Why'd you do that?

395
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,860
What else am l gonna do
with my money?

396
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,360
I wish you'd have listened to this.

397
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:09,950
I would have, except my record
player doesn't work now.

398
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,410
Your stereo's broken?

399
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:14,080
How can you stand it?
I can't live without music.

400
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:17,960
I don't follow music too much,
but I would really like to.

401
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:20,090
Then you haven't played
this record yet?

402
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,750
No.

403
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:27,260
But l was thinking maybe we could
listen to it on your record player.

404
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:31,180
Now, going back to
40 years of Chick Webb.

405
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:48,950
You gotta be kidding.

406
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,450
-What?
-This is a dirty movie.

407
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,870
No, no. This is a movie
that a lot of couples come to.

408
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:01,000
-All kinds of couples go here.
-You sure about that?

409
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,920
Yeah, l see them all the time.

410
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,300
Come on.

411
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:50,510
Shut the fuck up.

412
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,970
-Where are you going?
-l have to leave now.

413
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,470
-Why?
-l don't know why l came in here.

414
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,980
-l don't like these movies.
-Well, l mean--

415
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:01,100
I didn't know you'd feel
that way about this movie.

416
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:04,230
-lf I had known--
-These the only movies you go to?

417
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,440
Yeah, l mean I come and--
This is not so bad.

418
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:11,490
Taking me to a place like this is as
exciting to me as saying, "Let's fuck."

419
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:18,500
There are other places
I can take you.

420
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,830
I don't know much about them,
but I can take you other places.

421
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,830
We're just different.

422
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,630
-Wait a second.
-l have to go.

423
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,050
-l've gotta go now.
-Wait.

424
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:31,880
-Wait a second, I wanna talk to you.
-Look, I have to go.

425
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,590
Taxi!

426
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:37,970
Can l talk to you at least? Won't you at
least talk to me? I didn't know you'd--

427
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,520
Won't you take the record?

428
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:42,060
-l've already got it.
-But, please.

429
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:46,270
-l bought it for you, Betsy.
-Now l've got two. Let's go.

430
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,190
Can l call you?

431
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,530
Jesus Christ, l got a taxi.

432
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:58,990
Hello, Betsy.

433
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,910
Hi, it's Travis.

434
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:05,750
How you doing? Listen,
I'm sorry about the other night.

435
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,050
I didn't know that was
the way you felt about it.

436
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,930
Well, l didn't know. If l-- l would
have taken you somewhere else.

437
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,260
Are you feeling better or...?

438
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:23,850
Maybe you had a virus or something.
A 24-hour virus, you know.

439
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,360
It can happen. Yeah.

440
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:33,650
You've been working hard, huh?
Yeah.

441
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,990
Would you like to have
some dinner with me...

442
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,870
...in the next few days or something?

443
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,500
How about just a cup of coffee?

444
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:52,840
I could come by the headquarters
or something, and we could....

445
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,550
Okay, okay.

446
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,760
Did you get my flowers in the...?

447
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:07,020
You didn't get them?
But l sent some flowers.

448
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:13,320
Yeah. Well.... Okay, okay.

449
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:15,570
Can l call you again?

450
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:18,530
Tomorrow or the next day?
Okay.

451
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,620
No, I'm gonna--
Okay, yeah, sure. Okay.

452
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,290
So long.

453
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,540
I tried several times to call her...

454
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:31,630
...but after the first call, she wouldn't
come to the phone any longer.

455
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:34,460
I also sent flowers,
but with no luck.

456
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,300
The smell of the flowers
only made me sicker.

457
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:42,060
The headaches got worse.
I think l got stomach cancer.

458
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,770
I shouldn't complain, though.

459
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:47,270
You're only as healthy....

460
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,610
You're only as healthy as you feel.

461
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,320
You're only...

462
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:55,240
...as healthy...

463
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:56,860
...as...

464
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,660
...you...

465
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,240
...feel.

466
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:14,210
-Let's not have any trouble, okay?
-Why won't you talk to me?

467
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,880
You think I don't know you're here?

468
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:19,130
You think I don't know?

469
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,010
-Please leave.
-Take your hands off!

470
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,390
I just want you to know--

471
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,060
Please, just leave.
This is no place to do this.

472
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,350
Take your hands off me.

473
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,230
-Take your hands off!
-Just leave.

474
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,560
-All right, just leave, then.
-l'm gonna tell you...

475
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,400
...you're in a hell!
You'll die in hell like the rest.

476
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:38,360
-Come on. There's a cop.
-You're like the rest of them.

477
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,910
Look, l'm calling the cop.
Officer!

478
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,290
Officer!

479
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:50,250
Look, don't come around here,
because l'll call the police!

480
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:56,170
I realise now how much she's just
like the others, cold and distant.

481
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,050
And many people are like that.

482
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:01,550
Women for sure.
They're like a union.

483
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,300
Yo, cab!

484
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:15,980
Okay, pull over to the kerb over there.
Right over to the kerb. Over there.

485
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:20,070
No, no, don't-- Don't-- Don't--

486
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,660
The fucking meter.
What are you doing?

487
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,030
What are you doing with the meter?

488
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,410
Did I tell you to put--?
Did I tell you to do that with the meter?

489
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,660
Put the meter back.
Let the numbers go on.

490
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:32,540
I don't care what I have to pay.

491
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:36,380
I'm not getting out.
Put the meter back on.

492
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,590
Put it down.

493
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,970
Put it-- That's right.
Put it-- Put it down!

494
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,100
That's right.

495
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,470
Why are you writing?
Don't write!

496
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,180
Put the thing down. Just sit.

497
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:56,770
I didn't tell you to write.
I just said, "Pull over."

498
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:59,480
We pulled over to the kerb.
We're gonna sit here.

499
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,070
We're gonna sit.

500
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,760
Cabbie, you see that light up there?
The window?

501
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,600
The light?
The window in the second floor.

502
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:36,190
The one that's closest
to the edge of the building.

503
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,780
The light up in the window.
Second storey.

504
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,150
What are you, blind?

505
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,990
Do you see the light?

506
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:49,740
-Yeah.
-Yeah, you see it. Good.

507
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:53,040
You see the woman?

508
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:58,380
Do you see the woman in the window?

509
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:03,550
-Yeah.
-You see the woman. Good.

510
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,640
I want you to see that woman
because that's my wife.

511
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,010
But that's not my apartment.

512
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:16,650
It's not my apartment.
You know who lives there, huh?

513
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:21,230
No, I mean, you wouldn't know.
But you know who lives there?

514
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:24,150
A nigger lives there.

515
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,240
How do you like that?

516
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:35,410
And l'm g-- I'm gonna kill her.

517
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,500
There's nothing else.
I'm gonna kill her.

518
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:42,710
Well, what do you think of that?

519
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:46,680
I said, what do you think of that?

520
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,590
Don't answer.

521
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:51,050
You don't have to answer everything.

522
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,980
I'm gonna kill her
with a .44 Magnum pistol.

523
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:02,730
I have a .44 Magnum pistol.
I'm gonna kill her with that gun.

524
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:06,740
Did you ever see what a .44 Magnum
pistol can do to a woman's face?

525
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,870
I mean, it'd fucking destroy it.
Just blow it right apart.

526
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,370
That's what it can do to her face.

527
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,830
Did you ever see what it can do to
a woman's pussy? You should.

528
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:21,920
You should see what a .44 Magnum's
gonna do to a woman's pussy.

529
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:30,220
What's that?

530
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:33,390
I know you must think
that I'm, you know....

531
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,350
You must think
I'm pretty sick or something.

532
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:40,730
Right? You must think
I'm pretty sick?

533
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:48,400
Right? l bet you really
think l'm sick, right?

534
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:56,950
You think I'm sick?

535
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,670
You don't have to answer.
I'm paying for the ride.

536
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,590
I picked up this midget, you know.

537
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,340
He's very well-dressed,
Italian suit...

538
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:13,010
...good-looking,
with a beautiful tall blonde.

539
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,760
-Was it a lady midget?
-No, the guy was a midget.

540
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:18,270
-The blonde was a lady.
-l got you.

541
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,520
Those midgets are funny.

542
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:23,860
Sometimes I like to hold a midget.

543
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:26,860
They're funny. They always
wanna sit in the front seat.

544
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:32,360
Then l pick up these two fags.
They're going downtown.

545
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:38,700
They're wearing rhinestone T-shirts.
They start arguing and yelling.

546
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,920
The other one says, "You bitch,"
and starts beating him.

547
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,630
I say, "I don't care
what you do in the privacy...

548
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,210
...of your own home,
behind closed doors.

549
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,130
This is an American free country.

550
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:53,930
We got a pursuit of happiness thing.
You're consenting, you're adult.

551
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:58,720
But, you know, in my fucking cab,
don't go busting heads.

552
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:02,140
-God loves you, do what you want."
-Tell them to go to California.

553
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:07,020
In California, when two fags split up,
one's gotta pay the other one alimony.

554
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,240
Not bad. They're way ahead
out there, you know? California.

555
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:15,370
So l tell them to get out of the cab.

556
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:18,200
One time, I saw a cop chase
this guy with one leg.

557
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:21,540
-He was on crutches, you know.
-The cop?

558
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:25,040
No, the dude he was chasing.
Fucking cops, they chase anything.

559
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:28,710
-Hey, Travis.
-Hey, you got that 5 you owe me?

560
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:34,130
My man is loaded. Loaded.

561
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:39,010
I'd be broke if l hadn't caught me
some people from Ohio out at Kennedy.

562
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:43,350
I took them into Manhattan by way
of Long Beach, tipped me $5.

563
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,600
What's the action around?

564
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,400
It's pretty slow.

565
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:49,980
I'm shoving on.

566
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:52,530
Hey, Wiz, wait.

567
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,780
-Can l talk to you for a second?
-Bye, Killer.

568
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:01,910
Thank you. Night.

569
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,300
-You put it down.
-You can have them all you want!

570
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,890
Hey, don't be hitting my man!

571
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,190
You better take your ass out, boy!

572
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:32,150
Yeah?

573
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,820
I know you and l ain't talked
too much, you know.

574
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:37,910
But l figure you've been around a lot,
so you could....

575
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,620
Shoot, that's why
they call me the Wizard.

576
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:42,120
I got....

577
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:46,830
It's just that l got a.... I got a....

578
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,290
Things got you down?

579
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:51,540
Yeah, happens to the best of them.

580
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:55,260
Yeah, they got me real down.
Real....

581
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:02,350
I just wanna go out...

582
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:06,730
...and you know, like, really--
Really-- Really do something.

583
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:10,690
Taxi life, you mean?

584
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:14,230
Yeah, well....

585
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:16,320
No, it's....

586
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:18,820
I don't know.

587
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,200
I just wanna go out....

588
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:25,870
I really....

589
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:28,460
I really wanna....

590
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:31,750
I got some bad ideas in my head.
I just--

591
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,010
Look. Look at it this way.

592
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:41,140
A man....
A man takes a job, you know.

593
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,260
And that job...

594
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:47,810
...you know, that becomes what he is.

595
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,890
You know, like....

596
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,070
You do a thing,
and that's what you are.

597
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:59,110
I've been a cabbie for 1 7 years.
Ten years at night.

598
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,200
And l still don't own my own cab,
you know. Why?

599
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:07,160
Because I don't want to.
That must be what l want.

600
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:10,540
You know, to be on the night shift,
driving somebody else's cab.

601
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:12,420
You understand?

602
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:16,420
You get a job, you become the job.

603
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:20,180
One guy lives in Brooklyn,
one guy lives in Sutton Place.

604
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:22,890
You get a lawyer,
another guy's a doctor.

605
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:26,220
Another guy dies,
another guy gets well...

606
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,220
...and people are born.

607
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:30,560
I envy you, your youth.

608
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:35,190
Go out and get laid.
Get drunk. You know, do anything.

609
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:40,820
You got no choice, anyway.
I mean, we're all fucked.

610
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,740
More or less, you know?

611
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:52,670
I don't know. That's about
the dumbest thing l ever heard.

612
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:57,500
It's not Bertrand Russell,
but what do you want? I'm a cabbie.

613
00:48:57,670 --> 00:48:58,960
What do I know?

614
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:02,050
I don't even know what the fuck
you're talking about.

615
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:04,550
Maybe I don't know either.

616
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,430
Don't worry so much. Relax,
Killer, you're gonna be all right.

617
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,560
I know.
I've seen a lot of people...

618
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:16,940
-...and l know.
-Okay.

619
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:18,530
Okay. Thanks, man.

620
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:22,070
I'll see you. I guess....

621
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:27,490
Yeah, you know. You're all right.
You're all right.

622
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:49,970
What do you think of your opponent's
chances in the upcoming primary?

623
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:51,770
Mr. Goodman is a fine man.

624
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:55,310
I would certainly,
if it came to it, prefer him...

625
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:58,110
...to our opponent
in the other party.

626
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,940
I think that my programmes
are better defined than his.

627
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:05,860
They're more imaginative.
I have a better chance of winning.

628
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,910
It's academic, though. He's not
gonna win the primary. I am.

629
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,870
I see.

630
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:14,460
Well, one more thing
I'd like to ask you.

631
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:16,920
How do you feel
your campaign is going?

632
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:20,300
When we came up with our slogan
"We are the people"...

633
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,800
...when l said
"Let the people rule"...

634
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:25,880
...l felt l was being
somewhat overly optimistic.

635
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:29,680
I must tell you that l am more
optimistic now than ever before.

636
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:33,810
The people are rising to the demands
that l have made on them.

637
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:36,480
The people are beginning to rule.

638
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:39,310
I feel it is a groundswell.
I know...

639
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,480
...it will continue
through the primary and in Miami.

640
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:45,450
And l know it will rise...

641
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:48,360
...to an unprecedented swell
in November.

642
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:16,870
That bitch, goddamn!
I'll blow her brains out!

643
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:21,250
I'll kill her, goddamn it! l'm gonna
get my hands on her, I'll kill her!

644
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:22,750
Shoot, goddamn it! Fucker!

645
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:26,670
I swear if I get my hands on her,
I'll kill that fucking bitch!

646
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:29,970
-Hey, Sport.
-Hey, Sport.

647
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:32,340
I'll kill her! Damn it!

648
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:35,600
-That guy keeps following us.
-Don't look at him.

649
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:53,320
Hey, guys.

650
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,830
-You wanna take a walk?
-Yeah.

651
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,510
Loneliness has followed me
my whole life, everywhere.

652
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:17,310
In bars, in cars...

653
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,180
...sidewalks, stores, everywhere.

654
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:22,730
There's no escape.

655
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:25,650
I'm God's lonely man.

656
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:31,320
June 8th.

657
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:34,240
My life has taken another turn again.

658
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:37,950
The days move along
with regularity, over and over...

659
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,700
...one day indistinguishable
from the next.

660
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:43,410
A long, continuous chain.

661
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,460
And then suddenly...

662
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:47,750
...there is change.

663
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:05,270
Travis, this here's Easy Andy.
He's a travelling salesman.

664
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,560
How you doing, Travis?

665
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:33,010
-You got a .44 Magnum?
-lt's an expensive weapon.

666
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,260
That's all right. I got money.

667
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:37,180
It's a real monster.

668
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:41,970
Stop a car at 1 00 yards, put a round
right through the engine block.

669
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,690
Here you go.

670
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:57,740
It's a premium, high-resale weapon.

671
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,450
Look at that.

672
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,790
Look at that. That's a beauty.

673
00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:15,010
I could sell this gun to some
jungle bunny in Harlem for $500.

674
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:19,300
But l just deal high-quality goods
to the right people.

675
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:21,800
How about that?

676
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,180
This might be a little too big
for practical purposes.

677
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,640
In which case,
for you, l'd recommend...

678
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:29,850
...38 snub-nosed.

679
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:33,270
Look at this.

680
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:37,950
Look at that.
That's a beautiful little gun.

681
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:40,360
It's nickel-plated with a snub-nose...

682
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:42,990
...otherwise the same
as a service revolver.

683
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,450
That'll stop anything that moves.

684
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:49,040
The Magnum, they use that
in Africa for killing elephants.

685
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:52,460
That .38, that's a funny gun.

686
00:55:57,550 --> 00:55:59,800
Some of these guns are like toys.

687
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:03,140
That .38, you go out and
hammer nails with it all day...

688
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:06,640
...come back and it'll cut
dead centre on target every time.

689
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:10,810
It's got a really nice action to it
and a heck of a wallop.

690
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,230
You interested in an automatic?

691
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:19,570
It's a Colt .25 automatic.
It's a nice little gun.

692
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:20,990
It's a beautiful gun.

693
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,780
Holds six shots in the clip,
one shot in the chamber.

694
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:26,080
If you're dumb enough
to put a round there.

695
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:30,000
Here. Look at this.

696
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:31,710
.380 Walther.

697
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,170
Holds eight shots in the clip.

698
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:37,300
That's a nice gun.

699
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:40,010
That's a beautiful little gun.
Look at that.

700
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:47,720
During World War II, they used
this gun to replace the P 38.

701
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,770
Just given out to officers.

702
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:58,570
Ain't that a little honey?

703
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:10,330
-How much for everything?
-All together?

704
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:14,630
Well, only a jackass would carry
that cannon in the streets like that.

705
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:19,210
Here's a beautiful handmade holster
I had made in Mexico.

706
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:21,300
Forty dollars.

707
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:25,050
Three-fifty for the Magnum,
250 for the .38...

708
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:28,850
...one and a quarter for the .25,
1 50 for the .380.

709
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:32,270
You take this and wait here.
I'll walk down with you.

710
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:36,150
How about dope? Grass?
Hash? Coke?

711
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:40,320
Mescaline? Downers? Nembutal?
Tuinal? Chloral hydrates?

712
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:44,070
-How about uppers, amphetamines?
-No, I'm not interested in that stuff.

713
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,950
I can get you crystal meth,
nitrous oxide.

714
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,580
How about a Cadillac?
A brand-new Cadillac...

715
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:51,620
...with the pink slip, two grand.

716
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:01,760
June 29th.

717
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:05,720
I gotta get in shape now.
Too much sitting has ruined my body.

718
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:08,470
Too much abuse has gone on
for too long.

719
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,140
From now on, it'll be
50 pushups each morning.

720
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,480
Fifty pull-ups.
There will be no more pills.

721
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:18,860
There will be no more bad food,
no more destroyers of my body.

722
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,150
From now on, it'll be total organization.
Every muscle must be tight.

723
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:45,260
Look at the size of that.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

724
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:47,640
Oh, it looks so good.

725
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:57,440
It's getting harder and harder,
and it's throbbing now.

726
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:02,980
The idea had been growing
in my brain for some time.

727
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:05,320
True force.

728
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:10,160
All the king's men cannot
put it back together again.

729
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:14,620
-Where do we get more of these?
-Where do you think? At headquarters.

730
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:16,990
All the way back there?

731
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,410
-Come on.
-They'll work.

732
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:21,330
-Maybe it's the speakers.
-l've done this 1 00 times.

733
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:23,830
-You've done this before?
-Yes, don't worry.

734
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,960
-When was the last time?
-l've never done this before.

735
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:28,670
Betsy!

736
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:31,090
-Betsy!
-What?!

737
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,840
Betsy. Come here, come here.

738
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:30,730
Hey.

739
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:35,530
Hey, you're a Secret Service man,
aren't you?

740
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:39,700
Just waiting for the senator.

741
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:42,870
You're waiting for the senator?

742
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:48,920
That's a very good answer.

743
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:51,380
Shit, man.

744
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:55,970
I'm waiting for the sun to shine.
Yeah.

745
01:02:56,430 --> 01:03:00,140
No, the reason l asked
if you were a Secret Service man--

746
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:01,930
I won't say anything.

747
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:03,680
--is because l--

748
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:09,980
I saw some suspicious-looking
people over there.

749
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:12,400
-You did?
-They were right over there.

750
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:20,160
They were just here.

751
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:25,660
They were very, very....

752
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:28,250
-Suspicious.
-Yeah.

753
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,250
Where'd he go?

754
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:36,260
Is it hard to get to be in
the Secret Service?

755
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:37,510
Why?

756
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,640
Well, l was just curious,
because l think l'd be good at it.

757
01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:42,680
I'm very observant.

758
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:45,600
I was in the Marine Corps, you know.

759
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:47,940
I'm good with crowds.

760
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:53,770
I noticed your little pin there.
That's like a signal, isn't it?

761
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:55,070
Sort of.

762
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:59,360
A signal. A secret signal
for a Secret Service.

763
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:04,790
Hey, what kind of guns
you guys carry?

764
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:10,040
.38s? .45s? .357 Magnums?
Something bigger, maybe?

765
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:15,000
Look, if you're really interested, if
you give me your name and address...

766
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:18,760
...we'll send you all the information
on how to apply. How's that?

767
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:22,430
-You will?
-Sure.

768
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,140
Okay.

769
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,060
Why not?

770
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,480
My name is Henry...

771
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:35,860
...Krinkle. K-R-l-N-K-L-E.

772
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:43,160
1 54 Hopper Avenue.

773
01:04:43,410 --> 01:04:45,490
-"Hopper"?
-Yeah.

774
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:50,500
You know, like a rabbit? Hip, hop.

775
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,500
Fair Lawn, New Jersey.

776
01:04:58,260 --> 01:04:59,340
Is there a zip code?

777
01:04:59,590 --> 01:05:02,550
Yeah, 6-1-0-4-5-2.

778
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:08,560
-Okay?
-That's six digits. 6, 1 ....

779
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:12,730
Oh, well, 6-1 -0-4-5.

780
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:15,020
Okay.

781
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:18,320
I was thinking of
my telephone number.

782
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:19,650
Well, l've got it all.

783
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:22,610
Henry, we'll get all the stuff
right out to you.

784
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:26,330
Thanks a lot. Hey, great.
Thanks a lot. Hell. Jesus.

785
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:28,370
-Be careful today.
-Right. Will do.

786
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:32,790
You have to be careful around
a place like this. Bye.

787
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,420
Damn it!

788
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:06,200
Yeah.

789
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:13,460
I'm faster than you,
you fucking sick--

790
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:16,380
I saw you coming, you fuck.

791
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:18,250
Shitheel!

792
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:24,590
I'm standing here.
You make the move.

793
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,470
You make the move.

794
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:28,600
It's your move.

795
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:33,850
Don't try it, you fuck.

796
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:50,120
You talking to me?

797
01:06:52,370 --> 01:06:55,750
Well, then who the hell else are you
talking to? You talking to me?

798
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:58,250
Well, l'm the only one here.

799
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,460
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

800
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,340
Oh, yeah?

801
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:09,140
Okay.

802
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,810
Listen, you fuckers,
you screwheads.

803
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:21,570
Here is a man who would not
take it anymore.

804
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:23,940
Who would not let--

805
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:27,030
Listen, you fuckers,
you screwheads.

806
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:30,700
Here is a man who would not
take it anymore.

807
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:32,990
A man who stood up
against the scum...

808
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,580
...the cunts, the dogs,
the filth, the shit.

809
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:38,830
Here is someone who stood up.

810
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:47,170
You're dead.

811
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,410
Hey, Travis.

812
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,290
Hi, Melio.

813
01:08:28,510 --> 01:08:29,630
Yeah, man?

814
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:33,970
Okay, shut your fucking mouth and give
me the cash out the drawer. Come on!

815
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:37,020
-Let's go. Give me the damn cash.
-Don't shoot.

816
01:08:37,230 --> 01:08:39,430
Stop taking so long. Come on!

817
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:42,100
Let me have it. Give me the bread.

818
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:43,900
-This all you got?
-That's it.

819
01:08:44,070 --> 01:08:46,400
I don't have any more money, man.

820
01:08:46,610 --> 01:08:48,400
-That's all I got!
-You got more.

821
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:51,660
-l tell you, l got no money!
-Reach in your sock.

822
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:53,820
-Give me the rest of the bread.
-Hey. Hey.

823
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:01,790
-Did you get him?
-Yeah, I got him.

824
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:08,760
Shit, man.

825
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:13,510
-ls he dead?
-l don't know. His eyes are moving.

826
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:23,020
I ain't got a permit for this thing.
I don't know what l'm gonna do.

827
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:29,530
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

828
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:32,610
-Can l give you some money?
-No, man, just get out of here.

829
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:35,370
No, man. I'll take care of it.
Go ahead.

830
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:42,040
The fifth motherfucker this year!

831
01:11:27,730 --> 01:11:30,310
Walt Whitman, that great
American poet...

832
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:32,570
...spoke for all of us when he said:

833
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:35,570
"I am the man. l suffered.

834
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:38,950
I was there."
Today I say to you:

835
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:42,580
We are the people. We suffered.

836
01:11:42,830 --> 01:11:45,080
We were there.

837
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:50,580
We, the people,
suffered in Vietnam.

838
01:11:51,170 --> 01:11:53,920
We, the people, suffered.
We still suffer...

839
01:11:54,170 --> 01:11:56,920
...from unemployment, inflation...

840
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:59,180
...crime and corruption.

841
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:04,390
Dear Father and Mother...

842
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,930
...July is the month l remember...

843
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:10,350
...which brings not only
your wedding anniversary...

844
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,770
...but also Father's Day
and Mother's birthday.

845
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:16,900
I'm sorry I can't remember
the exact dates...

846
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:21,110
...but l hope this card
will take care of them all.

847
01:12:21,410 --> 01:12:24,530
I'm sorry, again, I cannot
send you my address...

848
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:27,200
...like l promised to last year.

849
01:12:27,370 --> 01:12:30,210
But the sensitive nature of my work
for the government...

850
01:12:30,370 --> 01:12:32,630
...demands utmost secrecy.

851
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:35,960
I know you will understand.

852
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:39,300
I am healthy and well
and making lots of money.

853
01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:41,800
I've been going with a girl
for several months...

854
01:12:42,050 --> 01:12:44,640
...and l know you'd be proud
if you could see her.

855
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:48,980
Her name is Betsy, but I can tell
you no more than that.

856
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:51,520
Hey, cabbie, you can't park here.

857
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:56,610
Come on! Come on, let's go!
Let's go! Move it!

858
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:02,450
--bear the burden of suffering
for the few.

859
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:05,990
No more will we fight the wars
of the few...

860
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:08,500
...through the heart of the many.

861
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:16,420
I hope this card finds you
all well, as it does me.

862
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:20,010
I hope no one has died.
Don't worry about me.

863
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:23,640
One day there will be a knock
on the door and it'll be me.

864
01:13:24,430 --> 01:13:26,430
Love, Travis.

865
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:34,850
Don't you have some idea?

866
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:36,860
I'm not the one who
wants to talk.

867
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:41,110
But you must know that the reason
that l didn't marry him...

868
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:45,200
...is because l couldn't stand
to be a cause of divorce.

869
01:13:47,870 --> 01:13:51,330
Now he's getting a divorce anyway.

870
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,500
Phillip wants to marry me, Brock.

871
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,880
I do love him.

872
01:14:06,970 --> 01:14:08,560
What about us, June?

873
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:11,890
Our marriage?

874
01:14:14,690 --> 01:14:16,690
You gotta know
our marriage wasn't legal.

875
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:20,030
In the eyes of God, we are married.

876
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:26,530
Brock, please don't do this to me.

877
01:14:28,910 --> 01:14:30,040
I love him so--

878
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:40,880
Damn.

879
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:44,420
Goddamn!

880
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:20,960
They trying to get in the picture.

881
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:27,800
-You looking for some action?
-Yeah.

882
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:34,430
-You see that guy over there?
-Yeah.

883
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,770
You go talk to him.
His name is Matthew.

884
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:40,480
-l'll be over there waiting for you.
-Okay.

885
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:47,400
Your name Matthew?
I want some action.

886
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:49,320
Officer.

887
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:54,490
I swear l'm clean.
I'm just waiting here for a friend.

888
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:57,000
You gonna bust me
for nothing, man?

889
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:59,580
I'm not a cop. l ain't a--

890
01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:02,000
Then why are you
asking me for action?

891
01:16:04,590 --> 01:16:06,590
Because she sent me over.

892
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:11,640
I suppose that ain't a .38
you've got in your sock.

893
01:16:11,850 --> 01:16:13,470
A .38?

894
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:17,930
I'm clean, man.

895
01:16:18,190 --> 01:16:20,850
-Shit, you're a real cowboy?
-Yeah.

896
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:24,520
That's nice, man. All right.
That's all right.

897
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:28,490
Fifteen dollars, 1 5 minutes.
Twenty-five dollars, half an hour.

898
01:16:30,110 --> 01:16:31,610
Shit.

899
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:33,240
A cowboy, huh?

900
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:37,200
I once had a horse.
In Coney lsland.

901
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:39,120
She got hit by a car.

902
01:16:41,670 --> 01:16:43,500
Well, take it or leave it.

903
01:16:43,710 --> 01:16:46,840
If you wanna save yourself
some money, don't fuck her.

904
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:48,840
Because you'll be back for more.

905
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:52,890
She's 1 2 and a half years old.
You ain't never had no pussy like that.

906
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,810
Do anything you want.
Come on her...

907
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:58,890
...fuck her in the mouth, in the ass.
Come on her face.

908
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:02,480
She'll get your cock so hard,
she'll make it explode.

909
01:17:04,570 --> 01:17:07,900
But no rough stuff. All right?

910
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:14,570
All right, l'll take it.

911
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:18,410
Hey, man! Don't take out no money
over here.

912
01:17:18,580 --> 01:17:19,830
You wanna fuck me?

913
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:23,080
You're gonna fuck her,
you give her the money.

914
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:26,090
Catch you later, copper.

915
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:29,590
-What'd you say?
-l'll see you later, copper.

916
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,090
I'm no cop, man.

917
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:37,720
Well, if you are,
it's entrapment already.

918
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:42,060
I'm hip.

919
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:45,440
Funny, you don't look hip.

920
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:51,900
Go ahead. Have yourself a good time.
Go ahead, man.

921
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:02,750
You're a funny guy.

922
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,960
But looks aren't everything.

923
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:10,260
Go ahead, man. Have a good time.

924
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:17,470
You're a funny guy.

925
01:18:57,510 --> 01:18:59,180
Hey.

926
01:18:59,470 --> 01:19:01,640
The room'll cost you 1 0 bucks.

927
01:19:14,650 --> 01:19:16,530
I'm timing you too.

928
01:19:35,550 --> 01:19:37,130
Come on.

929
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,310
Are you really 1 2 and a half?

930
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:54,440
Listen, mister, it's your time.
Fifteen minutes ain't long.

931
01:19:56,990 --> 01:19:59,860
When that cigarette burns out,
your time is up.

932
01:20:03,950 --> 01:20:05,500
How old are you?

933
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:09,250
You won't tell me?

934
01:20:09,670 --> 01:20:12,750
-What's your name?
-Easy.

935
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,880
-That's not any kind of name.
-lt's easy to remember.

936
01:20:16,090 --> 01:20:18,550
Yeah, but what's your real name?

937
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:20,260
I don't like my real name.

938
01:20:20,590 --> 01:20:22,600
But what's your real name?

939
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:27,850
Iris.

940
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:30,350
What's wrong with that?
It's a nice name.

941
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:32,650
That's what you think.

942
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:42,950
No, don't do that. Don't do that.
Don't you remember me?

943
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:47,290
Remember when you got into
a taxi? lt was a chequered taxi.

944
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:49,620
You got in and that guy
Matthew came by...

945
01:20:49,830 --> 01:20:52,290
...and he said he wanted to
take you away.

946
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:53,630
He pulled you away.

947
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:57,000
I don't remember that.

948
01:20:58,590 --> 01:21:01,470
-You don't remember any of that?
-No.

949
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,350
I'm gonna get you out of here.

950
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:06,850
Listen, we better make it
or Sport'll get mad.

951
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:10,140
-How do you wanna make it?
-l don't wanna make it. Who's Sport?

952
01:21:10,350 --> 01:21:13,150
That's Matthew. I call him Sport.

953
01:21:18,190 --> 01:21:20,190
Wanna make it like this?

954
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:27,490
Listen, l....

955
01:21:27,660 --> 01:21:29,160
Can't you understand something?

956
01:21:29,410 --> 01:21:33,000
You're the one that came into my cab.
You wanted to get out of here.

957
01:21:33,210 --> 01:21:34,670
Well, l must've been stoned.

958
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:38,500
-Why? They drug you?
-Oh, come off it, man.

959
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:42,130
What are you doing?

960
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:44,340
Don't you wanna make it?

961
01:21:47,430 --> 01:21:49,680
No, I don't wanna make it.
I wanna help you.

962
01:21:50,730 --> 01:21:52,520
Well, l could help you.

963
01:21:57,150 --> 01:21:58,400
Damn, man!

964
01:21:59,070 --> 01:22:00,690
Goddamn it!

965
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:07,870
Shit, man. What the hell's
the matter with you?

966
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:10,540
We don't have to make it, mister.

967
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:12,790
Damn it!
Don't you wanna get out of here?

968
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:18,210
Can't you understand why I'm here?

969
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:20,710
I think I understand.

970
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:24,220
I tried to get into your cab...

971
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:26,930
...and now you wanna
come and take me away.

972
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:31,770
-ls that it?
-Yeah, but don't you wanna go?

973
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:35,900
-l can leave any time I want to.
-Then what about that one night?

974
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:40,070
Look, l was stoned.

975
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:44,700
That's why they stopped me.

976
01:22:46,490 --> 01:22:49,410
When I'm not stoned l got
no place else to go.

977
01:22:50,740 --> 01:22:52,620
So they just...

978
01:22:53,210 --> 01:22:55,330
...protect me from myself.

979
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,260
I don't know.

980
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:09,100
I don't know. Okay, I tried.

981
01:23:09,970 --> 01:23:12,310
Hey, look, l understand.

982
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:17,600
-And it means something, really.
-Yeah, well.

983
01:23:18,230 --> 01:23:19,940
Well, look, can l see you again?

984
01:23:20,110 --> 01:23:22,610
-That's not hard to do.
-l don't mean like that.

985
01:23:22,820 --> 01:23:26,610
I mean, you know, regularly.
This is nothing for a person to do.

986
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:28,780
How about breakfast tomorrow?

987
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:30,990
-Tomorrow?
-l get up at 1 :00.

988
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:33,620
-One o'clock?
-One o'clock.

989
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:38,290
Well, l got a thing. I don't know--

990
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:39,790
Do you want to or not?

991
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Yeah, l want--
Okay, all right.

992
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:43,750
-Okay, 1 :00.
-One o'clock.

993
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:46,630
Okay. See you tomorrow.

994
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:50,800
Oh, lris. My name is Travis.

995
01:23:52,010 --> 01:23:54,140
Thanks a lot, Travis.

996
01:23:55,810 --> 01:23:59,150
So long, lris.
See you tomorrow.

997
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:02,480
Sweet lris.

998
01:24:26,510 --> 01:24:28,340
This is yours.

999
01:24:28,590 --> 01:24:30,180
Spend it right.

1000
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:37,390
Come back anytime, cowboy.

1001
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:39,440
I will.

1002
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:00,870
Why do you want me
to go back to my parents?

1003
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,580
They hate me.

1004
01:25:02,830 --> 01:25:06,090
Why do you think l split?
There ain't nothing there.

1005
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:09,840
Yeah, but you can't live like this.
It's a hell.

1006
01:25:10,050 --> 01:25:11,880
A girl should live at home.

1007
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:14,550
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?

1008
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:16,560
What do you mean, "women's lib"?

1009
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:19,600
You're a young girl.
You should be at home now.

1010
01:25:19,770 --> 01:25:21,940
You should be dressed up,
going out with boys.

1011
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:23,730
You should be going to school.

1012
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:27,650
-You know, that kind of stuff.
-Oh, God, are you square.

1013
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:29,900
Hey, I'm not square. You're square.

1014
01:25:30,070 --> 01:25:31,950
You're full of shit, man.

1015
01:25:32,110 --> 01:25:34,410
What are you talking about?
You walk out with...

1016
01:25:34,570 --> 01:25:36,950
...fucking creeps,
lowlifes and degenerates...

1017
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:40,620
...and you sell your little
pussy for nothing, man?

1018
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:42,750
For some lowlife pimp?

1019
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,080
Stands in a hall.

1020
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:49,300
I'm the--? l'm square?
You're the one that's square, man.

1021
01:25:49,590 --> 01:25:52,930
I don't go screw and fuck with
killers and junkies the way you do.

1022
01:25:53,970 --> 01:25:55,930
You call that being hip?

1023
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:58,600
What world you from?

1024
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:06,610
-Who's a killer?
-That guy Sport's a killer.

1025
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:08,270
Sport never killed nobody.

1026
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:09,940
-He killed--
-He's a Libra.

1027
01:26:10,150 --> 01:26:11,320
He's a what?

1028
01:26:11,530 --> 01:26:14,910
I'm a Libra too.
That's why we get along so well.

1029
01:26:17,330 --> 01:26:19,950
He looks like a killer to me.

1030
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:23,830
I think that Cancers
make the best lovers...

1031
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:26,290
...but my whole family
are air signs.

1032
01:26:26,460 --> 01:26:27,670
He's also a dope-shooter.

1033
01:26:28,630 --> 01:26:31,840
What makes you so high and mighty?
Will you tell me that?

1034
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:35,220
Did you ever try looking at
your own eyeballs in the mirror?

1035
01:26:41,310 --> 01:26:43,640
What'll you do about
Sport and that old bastard?

1036
01:26:43,850 --> 01:26:45,980
-When?
-When you leave.

1037
01:26:49,650 --> 01:26:50,820
I'll just leave them.

1038
01:26:51,030 --> 01:26:52,860
-Just leave?
-They got other girls.

1039
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:55,990
You just can't do that.
What are you gonna do?

1040
01:26:58,950 --> 01:27:00,330
Want me to call the cops?

1041
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:03,040
The cops don't do nothing.
You know that.

1042
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:07,370
Look, Sport never treated me bad.
He didn't beat me up once.

1043
01:27:07,670 --> 01:27:11,000
But you can't allow him to do
the same to other girls.

1044
01:27:11,170 --> 01:27:12,760
You can't allow him to do that.

1045
01:27:13,010 --> 01:27:15,170
He is the lowest kind of person.

1046
01:27:15,470 --> 01:27:17,340
Somebody's got to do
something to him.

1047
01:27:17,550 --> 01:27:19,010
He's the scum of the earth.

1048
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:20,760
He's the worst...

1049
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:24,560
...sucking scum
I have ever, ever seen.

1050
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:29,730
You know what he told me about you?

1051
01:27:32,030 --> 01:27:35,780
He called you names. He called
you a little piece of chicken.

1052
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:40,370
He does-- He--
He doesn't mean it.

1053
01:27:42,370 --> 01:27:46,040
I'll move up to one of them
communes in Vermont.

1054
01:27:50,380 --> 01:27:53,380
I never seen a commune before,
but I don't know.

1055
01:27:53,590 --> 01:27:55,710
I saw...

1056
01:27:56,050 --> 01:27:59,140
...some photos once in a magazine.
It didn't look very clean.

1057
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:01,640
Why don't you come with me?

1058
01:28:01,890 --> 01:28:05,430
What? Come to the commune
with you? No, no.

1059
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:07,060
Why not?

1060
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:12,820
-l don't go to places like that.
-Oh, come on, why not?

1061
01:28:13,070 --> 01:28:15,070
I don't get along with
people like that.

1062
01:28:15,570 --> 01:28:17,440
-Are you a Scorpion?
-What?

1063
01:28:17,610 --> 01:28:21,070
That's it. You're a Scorpion.
I can tell every time.

1064
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:24,240
Besides, l gotta stay here.

1065
01:28:24,450 --> 01:28:27,250
-Come on. Why?
-l got something very important to do.

1066
01:28:27,410 --> 01:28:29,040
So, what's so important?

1067
01:28:30,830 --> 01:28:33,130
I'm doing something
for the government.

1068
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:36,260
The cab thing is just part-time.

1069
01:28:37,420 --> 01:28:38,920
Are you a narc?

1070
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:42,550
Do I look like a narc?

1071
01:28:43,430 --> 01:28:45,100
Yeah.

1072
01:28:45,770 --> 01:28:47,560
I am a narc.

1073
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:52,100
God! I don't know who's
weirder, you or me.

1074
01:28:58,450 --> 01:29:02,450
-Sure you don't wanna come with me?
-l'll give you the money to go.

1075
01:29:02,990 --> 01:29:05,660
-You don't have to do that.
-l want you to take it.

1076
01:29:05,950 --> 01:29:08,660
I don't want you to take
anything from them.

1077
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,710
And l wanna do it.

1078
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:13,460
I don't have anything better
to do with my money.

1079
01:29:15,340 --> 01:29:17,630
I might be going away
for a while.

1080
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:46,660
You're just a little tense,
that's all.

1081
01:29:46,910 --> 01:29:49,370
I don't like what l'm doing, Sport.

1082
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:52,620
Baby, l never wanted you
to like what you're doing.

1083
01:29:52,830 --> 01:29:56,750
If you ever liked what you were doing,
you wouldn't be my woman.

1084
01:29:58,510 --> 01:30:01,010
You never spend any time
with me anymore.

1085
01:30:01,170 --> 01:30:04,260
Well, l got to attend
to business, baby.

1086
01:30:05,350 --> 01:30:07,850
You miss your man, don't you?

1087
01:30:09,180 --> 01:30:12,560
I don't like to be away
from you either.

1088
01:30:12,770 --> 01:30:15,350
You know how l feel about you.

1089
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:18,440
I depend on you.

1090
01:30:20,860 --> 01:30:22,030
I'd be lost without you.

1091
01:30:23,530 --> 01:30:25,950
Don't you ever forget that.

1092
01:30:35,380 --> 01:30:37,670
How much I need you.

1093
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:41,590
Come to me, baby.

1094
01:30:51,730 --> 01:30:53,480
Let me hold you.

1095
01:31:00,070 --> 01:31:04,320
When you're close to me like this,
I feel so good.

1096
01:31:08,990 --> 01:31:13,500
I only wish every man could know
what it's like to be loved by you.

1097
01:31:18,460 --> 01:31:21,420
That every woman, everywhere...

1098
01:31:23,130 --> 01:31:26,260
...had a man who loves her
like l love you.

1099
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:33,520
God, it's good so close.

1100
01:31:45,490 --> 01:31:47,490
You know, at times like this...

1101
01:31:47,990 --> 01:31:50,820
...l know l'm a lucky man.

1102
01:31:53,620 --> 01:31:56,870
Touching a woman who
wants me and needs me.

1103
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:06,300
It's only you that keeps me together.

1104
01:33:38,390 --> 01:33:41,230
Now l see it clearly.
My whole life has pointed...

1105
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,730
...in one direction. l see that now.

1106
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:48,440
There never has been
any choice for me.

1107
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:24,600
Ladies and gentlemen...

1108
01:34:24,810 --> 01:34:29,110
...the next president of the United
States, Senator Charles Palantine.

1109
01:34:35,530 --> 01:34:36,820
Thank you, Tom.

1110
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:39,280
Ladies and gentlemen...

1111
01:34:40,290 --> 01:34:44,620
...we are met today at a crossroads,
Columbus Circle.

1112
01:34:44,790 --> 01:34:46,960
This is no ordinary place.

1113
01:34:47,170 --> 01:34:51,960
It is a place where many roads
and many lives intersect.

1114
01:34:53,130 --> 01:34:55,800
It is appropriate that
we meet here today...

1115
01:34:56,090 --> 01:34:59,350
...because these
are not ordinary times.

1116
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:02,640
We meet at a crossroads in history.

1117
01:35:04,310 --> 01:35:07,980
For far too long, the wrong roads
have been taken.

1118
01:35:08,270 --> 01:35:12,480
The wrong roads have led us
into war, into poverty...

1119
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:15,610
...into unemployment and inflation.

1120
01:35:16,490 --> 01:35:20,160
Today l say to you,
we have reached the turning point.

1121
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:28,170
No longer will we, the people,
suffer for the few.

1122
01:35:36,340 --> 01:35:40,640
Now, l would lie to you if l told you
the new roads would be easy.

1123
01:35:41,310 --> 01:35:43,350
They will not be easy.

1124
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:47,140
Nothing that is right and good
has ever been easy.

1125
01:35:47,350 --> 01:35:49,350
We, the people, know that.

1126
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:57,610
And we, the people,
know the right roads and the good.

1127
01:35:58,620 --> 01:36:02,910
Today l say to you,
we are the people, you and l.

1128
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:06,410
And it is time to let the people rule!

1129
01:36:06,660 --> 01:36:07,870
Thank you.

1130
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:26,390
All right, let him through. Pull back.

1131
01:36:31,150 --> 01:36:33,270
Palantine.

1132
01:36:41,030 --> 01:36:42,740
Thank you. Thank you.

1133
01:36:47,660 --> 01:36:49,040
Over there. Get that man.

1134
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:52,960
Give him some air!

1135
01:36:53,670 --> 01:36:55,590
Give him some air, will you?

1136
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:57,760
-l never saw him.
-l saw him run.

1137
01:36:58,050 --> 01:36:59,930
-l saw him.
-Where was he?

1138
01:37:26,580 --> 01:37:27,740
What's happening?

1139
01:37:27,950 --> 01:37:29,290
Got the money?

1140
01:37:40,470 --> 01:37:41,630
-lris in her room?
-Yeah.

1141
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:43,300
Okay.

1142
01:38:19,050 --> 01:38:21,010
Hey, Sport, how you doing?

1143
01:38:21,170 --> 01:38:23,300
Okay, okay, my man. How--?

1144
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:27,680
-Where do I know you from, man?
-l don't know.

1145
01:38:27,890 --> 01:38:30,180
How's everything
in the pimp business?

1146
01:38:31,350 --> 01:38:33,520
-Do l know you?
-No.

1147
01:38:33,770 --> 01:38:35,190
Do I know you?

1148
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:37,310
Get out of here.
Come on, get lost.

1149
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:39,150
Do I know you?

1150
01:38:41,490 --> 01:38:42,860
How's lris?

1151
01:38:43,150 --> 01:38:44,530
You know Iris.

1152
01:38:44,780 --> 01:38:47,490
No, I don't know nobody named lris.

1153
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:49,790
Iris? Come on, get out of here, man.

1154
01:38:50,290 --> 01:38:55,000
-You don't know anybody named lris?
-l don't know nobody named lris.

1155
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:56,710
No?

1156
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:59,590
Get back to your fucking tribe
before you get hurt.

1157
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:02,300
I don't want no trouble, okay?

1158
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:05,220
You got a gun?

1159
01:39:06,430 --> 01:39:09,550
Get the fuck out of here, man.
Get out of here.

1160
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:11,680
Suck on this.

1161
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:47,760
Hey!

1162
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:27,970
You crazy son of a bitch!

1163
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:29,630
Fucking son of a bitch!

1164
01:40:29,930 --> 01:40:34,510
I'll kill you! l'll kill you!

1165
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:37,680
I'll kill you!
I'll fucking kill you!

1166
01:40:37,940 --> 01:40:40,020
Crazy son of a bitch!
I'll kill you!

1167
01:40:57,660 --> 01:40:59,000
Crazy son of a bitch!

1168
01:40:59,170 --> 01:41:02,630
You fucking bastard! l'll kill you!

1169
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:05,960
You crazy son of a bitch!
I'll kill you!

1170
01:41:06,130 --> 01:41:10,180
I'll kill you! l'll kill you! l'll kill you!

1171
01:41:13,140 --> 01:41:14,850
Stop!

1172
01:41:27,650 --> 01:41:28,740
Don't shoot him!

1173
01:46:08,310 --> 01:46:09,810
Dear Mr. Bickle:

1174
01:46:10,020 --> 01:46:13,980
I can't say how happy
Mrs. Steensma and l were...

1175
01:46:14,150 --> 01:46:17,150
...to hear that you are
well and recuperating.

1176
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:20,240
We tried to visit you at the hospital...

1177
01:46:20,490 --> 01:46:23,150
...when we were in New York
to pick up lris...

1178
01:46:23,450 --> 01:46:25,990
...but you were still in a coma.

1179
01:46:26,280 --> 01:46:28,330
There is no way we can repay you...

1180
01:46:28,540 --> 01:46:31,660
...for returning our lris to us.

1181
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:33,620
We thought we had lost her...

1182
01:46:33,830 --> 01:46:37,000
...and now our lives are full again.

1183
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:38,840
Needless to say...

1184
01:46:39,050 --> 01:46:43,550
...you are something
of a hero around this household.

1185
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:47,800
I'm sure you want to know about lris.

1186
01:46:48,010 --> 01:46:51,520
She's back in school and working hard.

1187
01:46:51,810 --> 01:46:54,850
The transition has been
very hard for her...

1188
01:46:55,020 --> 01:46:56,350
...as you can well imagine.

1189
01:46:57,860 --> 01:46:59,400
But we have taken steps to see...

1190
01:46:59,650 --> 01:47:03,820
...she has never cause
to run away again.

1191
01:47:04,410 --> 01:47:05,820
In conclusion...

1192
01:47:06,030 --> 01:47:09,780
...Mrs. Steensma and l
would like to again thank you...

1193
01:47:10,040 --> 01:47:12,700
...from the bottom of our hearts.

1194
01:47:12,910 --> 01:47:17,000
Unfortunately, we cannot afford
to come to New York again...

1195
01:47:17,210 --> 01:47:21,170
...to thank you in person,
or we surely would.

1196
01:47:21,380 --> 01:47:24,220
But if you should ever
come to Pittsburgh...

1197
01:47:24,510 --> 01:47:29,050
...you would find yourself
a most welcome guest in our home.

1198
01:47:29,350 --> 01:47:34,230
Our deepest thanks,
Burt and lvy Steensma.

1199
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:39,730
Eddie, the owner-operator, comes up,
he says, "Hey, l wanna swap tyres."

1200
01:47:39,900 --> 01:47:41,520
I say, "These are new tyres.

1201
01:47:42,070 --> 01:47:44,900
Why not throw in something else,
like your wife?"

1202
01:47:45,110 --> 01:47:49,200
-His wife was Miss New Jersey of 1 957.
-That's why the fleet has no spares.

1203
01:47:49,410 --> 01:47:51,830
-Doughboy, Wizard, Killer.
-Hey.

1204
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:54,450
-Charlie T.
-What's happening?

1205
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:56,960
Hey, Travis, you got a fare.

1206
01:47:58,460 --> 01:47:59,750
Shit.

1207
01:48:00,590 --> 01:48:01,960
Well, see you later.

1208
01:48:02,250 --> 01:48:03,880
See you, Travis.

1209
01:48:24,990 --> 01:48:26,780
Hello, Travis.

1210
01:48:28,240 --> 01:48:29,450
Hello.

1211
01:48:50,390 --> 01:48:53,100
I hear Palantine got the nomination.

1212
01:48:54,390 --> 01:48:57,480
Yeah, won't be long now.
Seventeen days.

1213
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:00,400
Well, l hope he wins.

1214
01:49:13,990 --> 01:49:17,120
I read about you in the papers.
How are you?

1215
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:22,670
Oh, it was nothing, really.
I got over that.

1216
01:49:25,170 --> 01:49:27,670
The papers always
blow these things up.

1217
01:49:29,510 --> 01:49:32,800
Just a little stiffness. That's all.

1218
01:50:09,050 --> 01:50:11,050
Travis.

1219
01:50:16,760 --> 01:50:18,470
How much was it?

1220
01:50:27,610 --> 01:50:28,980
So long.
