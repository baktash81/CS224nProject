00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,955
- Morning. - You're off to an early start.

5
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,223
Me?

6
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:04,357
What time did you get up to do all that?

7
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,992
Ah, it's on my way in.

8
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:07,160
It comes with the job.

9
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,197
That must be why you get an office

10
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,634
with your name on the door.

11
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:16,402
You think Denny would give you the big office

12
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,104
if you waxed his car?

13
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:19,506
It's not like that.

14
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:23,443
He's got a lot on his mind right now.

15
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:24,844
Well, if he doesn't get here soon,

16
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:28,481
you'll have to deal with that battleaxe Mrs. Rose.

17
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,215
Bam!

18
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,450
Right over them.

19
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,952
[laughs] Look, don't work too hard.

20
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:34,020
Hey, good morning.

21
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,555
Good morning, Denny.

22
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,389
Where's Claire?

23
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,291
She's in with your 10 o'clock.

24
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:39,993
I don't know why I bother coming in at all.

25
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,928
Think fast.

26
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:45,064
Mr. Montana believes this will deal with all your concerns.

27
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,733
Well, yes, but--

28
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,967
Is there a question?

29
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:49,068
Mark Morensi won't get as much--

30
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:50,136
[beep]

31
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:51,738
Yes?

32
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,907
Sorry to interrupt, but could you come out here for a moment?

33
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,174
Can it wait?

34
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,409
I'm afraid not.

35
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,877
Will you excuse me?

36
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,852
What?

37
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,554
Denny needs a consult.

38
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,622
Will you excuse me for just one minute, please?

39
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,198
Oh, hi.

40
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,134
Where have you been?

41
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:24,671
Which one of these ties goes with this jacket?

42
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:25,772
Good morning.

43
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,740
I told Mrs. Rose you were delayed at court.

44
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,342
Who?

45
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:30,610
The changes to her will.

46
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,879
Oh, you're so efficient, I'm sure you've

47
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:33,980
got it all under control.

48
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,648
Yes, but you're her lawyer.

49
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,050
Remember she was afraid her son would

50
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,184
be hit with a big tax bill?

51
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,752
As soon as you pick a tie.

52
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,370
Oh, it's perfect.

53
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:01,674
[whistles] Margo is taking me out to lunch.

54
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,042
Oh.

55
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:05,178
She got Bernier to give us a firm offer on the vineyard.

56
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:06,779
We're going to discuss it.

57
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,981
Of course you are.

58
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,849
You think I can't combine business with pleasure?

59
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:13,553
So what about Mrs. Rose?

60
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,588
Oh, did you get a card for the flowers?

61
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:16,990
You could just write a note.

62
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:17,957
No, no.

63
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,292
I never know what to say.

64
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,327
Yeah, I'll just get one from the drugstore.

65
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,996
No, you'll speak to Mrs. Rose.

66
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,801
All right, yes, I will get you a card.

67
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:29,702
See?

68
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,404
You are perfect.

69
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,172
Mrs. Rose, you can't just go in there.

70
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:36,542
Ah, Mrs. Rose, don't you look marvelous.

71
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:37,810
Doesn't she look marvelous?

72
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:38,711
Now.

73
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:41,781
A card.

74
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,353
Oh.

75
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:56,095
[laughs] Perfect.

76
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,440
Claire.

77
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,841
- Is that [inaudible]? - Yeah, but Claire--

78
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:09,842
- Oh-- - Wait.

79
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,311
- --I've got to get my laptop. - Wait!

80
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,311
We want to speak to major shareholders.

81
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:16,015
I-- do you mind?

82
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,484
Yes.

83
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,420
I'll call you back.

84
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,721
Can I help you?

85
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,323
Well, if it's not asking too much,

86
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,358
a little privacy would be appreciated.

87
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,126
Well, that explains why you're sitting at my desk

88
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:28,428
using my telephone. - Uh, Claire--

89
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,430
I might, if you weren't out buying

90
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,665
love notes on company time.

91
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:35,168
Lori, does this person have an appointment with Mr. Montana?

92
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,202
Not exactly.

93
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,637
I don't need an appointment.

94
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,138
Excuse me, you can't just barge into my office--

95
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,740
I am Mr. Montana.

96
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,545
Regan Montana?

97
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:49,182
No, I don't suppose my little brother ever mentions my name.

98
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,117
I'm sorry, I--

99
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:52,618
how can I help you?

100
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:56,756
Well, for starters, you can remove this debris.

101
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:01,294
I need an office, and this, apparently, is it.

102
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,562
This is my office.

103
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,464
These are my things.

104
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:05,898
I have dozens of open files.

105
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,468
Well, we all have to make sacrifices.

106
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:09,602
Does Denny know about this?

107
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,003
Yeah, he told me to--

108
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,605
I'm going to back him up on the vineyard merger.

109
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,041
Now, I'm sure you can take care of the details.

110
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,410
So when the courier shows up, will you just tell

111
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,346
him, uh, where to put my flies?

112
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:21,614
No problem.

113
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,049
I'll tell him exactly where to put them.

114
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,524
Hey!

115
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,459
I see you met by big brother.

116
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,994
Hey, buddy, where do you want these?

117
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,462
Hey, just put them right there, bro.

118
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,730
It was a total surprise.

119
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,465
He's been living in London for 10 years.

120
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,666
No, no, no, don't put them there.

121
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,569
Just put them in there.

122
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:46,139
We can put up with him for a few days.

123
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,073
Look, I'm sorry.

124
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,475
He won't stay long.

125
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,044
I need to get all the details on--

126
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,212
what do you want?

127
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:54,881
She said to put these boxes in here.

128
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,216
Does anyone care that I'm trying to get some work done?

129
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:58,351
Listen, Philip--

130
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,453
Do you want these in here or not?

131
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:01,621
Don't matter to me.

132
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,458
Yeah, I'm sorry.

133
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:18,571
He is so cool, the way he just steps in and takes charge.

134
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:19,972
You can't be serious.

135
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,240
He's a bully.

136
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,142
He's a hunk.

137
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:24,377
All the men I know are boys.

[LOUD CONVERSATION IN THE BACKGROUND]

139
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:29,248
--bank is happy with it.

140
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:30,616
Well, why should they care?

141
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:32,618
They'll get their money from you, or from mother.

142
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:34,987
Funny you should worry about that now.

143
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:38,591
Have you given any thought to why Bernier wants this merger?

144
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:39,826
That's not my business.

145
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,994
It's tough enough negotiating our end.

146
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:45,131
If you took the time to figure out what's in it for him,

147
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,632
you would make a better deal.

148
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,267
Why do you think you can just drop in after 10 years

149
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:49,535
and run everything?

150
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,636
Well, it's pretty obvious that somebody

151
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:51,971
has to take charge around here.

152
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:55,541
Especially that dad's not here to do it, huh?

153
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,742
Excuse me.

154
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,011
This is a private meeting.

155
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,479
That was a closed door.

156
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,181
Denny wanted this distribution deal

157
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,217
as soon as I finished with it.

158
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,820
My files are a little disorganized this morning.

159
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,889
He asked me to follow up on some ideas.

160
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,157
Really?

161
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,825
Denny saw a window to increase the vineyard's exports.

162
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,060
Oh?

163
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,462
Tell me about it, Denny.

164
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:19,799
Growth opportunities, you know, the usual.

165
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,834
Hm?

166
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:25,504
Yeah, the world is crazy for California chardonnay,

167
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:26,873
and I thought--

168
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,876
well, we thought-- that, you know.

169
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,315
Why don't I just read it for myself?

170
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:40,419
What's up with him?

171
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,888
It's just how he is.

172
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,690
Regan's always been very intense.

173
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,192
I'm so relieved.

174
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,194
I thought it was personal.

175
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:51,531
Should've known him 10 years ago before he went to London.

176
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,766
Hello, darling.

177
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,867
Margo!

178
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,269
Just in the nick of time.

179
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,503
We need to talk.

180
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:01,007
I have Bernier's final offer in my car.

181
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:01,941
Woo!

182
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:02,642
Good work!

183
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:03,976
That was quick.

184
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:05,811
That's how he is.

185
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,447
I found him a vineyard in South America a couple of years ago,

186
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:11,250
and he did the whole business in two weeks.

187
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,184
Nice tie.

188
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,219
Thank you.

189
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:17,089
And now he wants land in Napa.

190
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:22,728
I can see why they call you the best broker in the Bay Area.

191
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:26,299
They're beautiful, darling.

192
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,333
Merci, Claire.

193
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:28,267
They're lovely.

194
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,202
You're welcome.

195
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,337
And a card.

196
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:32,305
- Uh-huh. - Could you hold this?

197
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,239
Sure.

198
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,048
[chuckles]

199
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:50,389
Listen, there's something you should know about the merger.

200
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,525
So you're Denny's brother.

201
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,060
What a pleasant surprise.

202
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,529
Oh, no, the pleasure's all mine.

203
00:09:56,629 --> 00:10:00,733
Shame on you, Denny, keeping him a secret.

204
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,301
You must join us for lunch.

205
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,303
Well, unfortunately, I have a lot to catch up on,

206
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,872
but you two enjoy yourselves.

207
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,375
Only if you promise to join us some other time.

208
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:10,910
Absolutely.

209
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,283
Later.

210
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:18,384
Much later.

211
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:19,385
Get back to work.

212
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,657
So, Margo, where are you taking me to lunch?

213
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,459
Wherever you'd like.

214
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,627
Well, that's Denny.

215
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,629
He's got two women on the hook, and one of them

216
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,999
is taking care of the other.

217
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,066
What?

218
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,569
Ever since high school, my brother's

219
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:37,937
had a line of women ready to provide

220
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,839
for all his personal needs.

221
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,240
I work for Denny.

222
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,476
I have very clear boundaries between my professional

223
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:44,443
and my personal life.

224
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,012
I'm sure you do.

225
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,347
Buying cute cards for Denny's girlfriends all part

226
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,582
of your job description.

227
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:50,716
I do what he asks me to.

228
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:51,784
I'm going to lunch.

229
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:52,918
That's impossible.

230
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,453
I had a lot of catching up to do.

231
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,589
Well then, you'll be too busy to miss me while I'm gone.

232
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,624
I'm afraid I need your help.

233
00:10:58,724 --> 00:10:59,892
This Bernier's flying in tomorrow.

234
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,328
There's a lot I need to know before then.

235
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:03,596
If I don't eat, I get irritable.

236
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,331
I'd hat to see that.

237
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:06,932
I'll bring you back something.

238
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,974
When was the last time anybody cleaned out these files?

239
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,475
Are you looking for something specific,

240
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:17,743
or are you just rooting around?

241
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,912
Well, my files in London looked like this.

242
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,049
Maybe you'd be more comfortable there.

243
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,316
Don't worry.

244
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,819
I just have to get Denny through this deal and I'm gone.

245
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:27,953
How can I help you?

246
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:33,359
Well, to begin with, you can bring

247
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,294
me up to date on the vineyard.

248
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:39,198
Napa Hills was pretty much your father's domain.

249
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,167
When it came to running the vineyard,

250
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,935
Denny didn't pay much attention to the day to day.

251
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,204
Why am I not surprised?

252
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,740
So, if I wanted to see sales for the last five years,

253
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,643
I'd have to look through every one of these files?

254
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:53,679
That would be one way.

255
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,348
Napa Hill wine sales by region or variety.

256
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:57,450
All you had to do was ask.

257
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,464
Hi, honey!

258
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,333
I'm home. Hey, little brother.

259
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:15,468
Whatcha doing?

260
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,670
Making supper.

261
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,672
It's my turn.

262
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,742
Well, that never inspired you before.

263
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:25,978
Yeah, but it's for a school project.

264
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,114
What, weird science?

265
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:28,848
Ha ha.

266
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:29,782
Life skills.

267
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,684
It's an omelette.

268
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,986
Smells good.

269
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,387
How was your history test?

270
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,923
Oh, I remembered Bull Run and Pickett's Charge,

271
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,059
but I thought The Monitor was the Merry Mack.

272
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,394
We went over this last night.

273
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:43,496
Yeah, well, I got a B.

274
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,131
A B is good.

275
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:45,898
Uh-oh.

276
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,800
What's wrong?

277
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,635
Nothing, why?

278
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:52,171
A B is good?

279
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,574
You better quit while you're ahead.

280
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:56,509
Ah!

281
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,348
What?

282
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,317
You've got that Denny's driving me crazy look.

283
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:06,352
Don't be a smart ass.

284
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,286
Eat.

285
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,959
If the guy makes you that nuts, why don't you just quit?

286
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,061
I'd never make the same money anywhere else.

287
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,831
OK, OK, it's none of my business.

288
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,600
Don't give me that.

289
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,269
Do you like the omelette?

290
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:24,003
Sean, what is it?

291
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,772
What's bugging you?

292
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,742
Denny's a jerk.

293
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,911
You need a guy that treats you better.

294
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,612
He's not that bad.

295
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:34,847
It's just a job.

296
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,449
Yeah, right.

297
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,484
What's that supposed to mean?

298
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,957
Denny Montana would make a lousy brother-in-law.

299
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,082
Claire?

300
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,922
Well, I guess you start early.

301
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,657
Do you have a draft of that distribution agreement

302
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:20,426
somewhere? - It's in Denny's office.

303
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,094
He was working on it.

304
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,929
What time can we expect the young Mr. Montana

305
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,998
to put in an appearance?

306
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,299
I'd have to check his calendar.

307
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,872
I'm sure he was up late last night, mulling

308
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:36,408
over Margo's latest offer.

309
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:37,343
Hi, Phillip?

310
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:38,477
Yeah, it's Regan.

311
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:42,581
Oh, Denny.

312
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,469
These are your notes.

313
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,237
Actually, Denny did most of the work.

314
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:07,539
Actually, Denny didn't know anything about this yesterday.

315
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,341
Hey!

316
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:10,542
Morning.

317
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:11,844
What you up to?

318
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:14,747
Just going through some vineyard details.

319
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,015
OK.

320
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,182
We have the power of temp lease at 2:00?

321
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:18,751
Right. It's all taken care of.

322
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:19,852
Lori has the file on her desk.

323
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,453
I'm going to need you to brief me.

324
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,522
Uh, I need her to bring me up to speed for tonight's meeting

325
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:24,823
with Bernier.

326
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:25,991
It's dinner.

327
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,326
I don't know what you're used to,

328
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,462
but here we eat, drink, talk, social, you know.

329
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:31,397
You can fake it.

330
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:32,998
I'd rather not.

331
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,801
Let me keep her for another hour?

332
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:36,735
OK.

333
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:43,242
And by the way, today we're going out for lunch.

334
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:48,047
I can't leave.

335
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,615
I have to brief Denny. - It's a lease.

336
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:50,783
How tough can it be?

337
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,151
But he isn't really ready.

338
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,719
You mean he hasn't even looked at it yet.

339
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,688
Listen, I happen to know if you don't eat you get irritable,

340
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,622
so get in.

341
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,128
Also, I need someone to help me organize my thoughts.

342
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:05,864
Too bad we aren't in France.

343
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:07,900
You could just take your dog to lunch.

344
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,968
Well, that has a certain appeal.

345
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,171
[music playing]

346
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,957
The country club?

347
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,826
Don't you have to be a member?

348
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,394
You forget-- I used to live here.

349
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,532
Hello, Mr. Montana.

350
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:41,934
It's been a long time.

351
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,068
This way, please.

352
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:49,808
Enjoy your meal.

353
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,110
Thank you.

354
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,512
Looks like everybody else did, too.

355
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,180
I'm sorry?

356
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,582
Used to live here.

357
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,688
Have you had enough time to decide?

358
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:03,589
Yes.

359
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,590
No.

360
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,024
Would you like to hear the specials?

361
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:06,925
Yes.

362
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:09,928
No.

363
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,730
No.

364
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,532
What would you like?

365
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:19,705
Um-- I'll have a green salad, please.

366
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,073
Is that all?

367
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,775
I'm not that hungry.

368
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,143
Suit yourself.

369
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,578
I'll have the, uh, green salad, please,

370
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,881
followed by the risotto. - Excellent choice, sir.

371
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,682
Some wine?

372
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,451
You choose.

373
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,821
As long as it's a Napa Hill's vintage.

374
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,624
Um, merlot?

375
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,528
Merlot is for children.

376
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:51,036
This is an '85 Cabernet Sauvignon.

377
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:52,171
No, no, no.

378
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,305
Smell the berries.

379
00:17:57,075 --> 00:17:58,343
Now, taste the fruit.

380
00:17:58,444 --> 00:17:59,478
Tell me what you taste.

381
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:05,584
I can taste the berries--

382
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,956
and plums.

383
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,357
I remember harvesting these grapes.

384
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:19,832
Warm days, cool nights and good wine.

385
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,342
Thank you.

386
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:36,715
So, tell me, tell me what you know about this Bernier.

387
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:38,951
Not much.

388
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:43,088
Call me paranoid, if I was some kind of vulture looking

389
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,724
to pick up a vineyard at Value Village prices,

390
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:46,992
I'd find us a prime target.

391
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:48,293
I've got to assume that Bernier's

392
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,929
playing the same game, so what is he after?

393
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,030
Well, it seems pretty simple.

394
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,031
He's got a lot of cash.

395
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:55,067
He's looking to expand.

396
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,069
Why are you just a paralegal?

397
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,470
Excuse me?

398
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,105
You obviously have the talent for law school.

399
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,306
Where did you go?

400
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:04,409
I happen to like my job very much.

401
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,345
What are you trying to hide?

402
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,614
It's clear you're the brains behind Denny's law practice.

403
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:13,051
Oh, this is great.

404
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:14,219
Thank you.

405
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,226
Mm, this is good.

406
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,028
You sure you're not hungry?

407
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:23,962
Oh, no, I'm fine.

408
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:25,831
Positive.

409
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:28,534
So, tell me about your distribution agreement.

410
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:31,436
Well actually, it's Denny's.

411
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,572
- You could order something. - No, I'm fine.

412
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:37,442
So?

413
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:40,579
Well, Denny proposed an output deal.

414
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,982
They take the wine we produce at a guaranteed price.

415
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:45,384
And why would they want that?

416
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:48,287
As a favor to your father for old time's sake.

417
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,588
We didn't think they'd see much downside

418
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:50,989
risk because the volume has been so

419
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:52,524
low for the last three years.

420
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:55,460
Well, if there's no volume, what good is the deal to us?

421
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,029
Look, if you're hungry, just take it.

422
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,665
No, no, I'm fine, really.

423
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:02,601
Your father needed the security of a purchase guarantee.

424
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,404
He had to refinance the replacement of root stocks.

425
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:06,772
[claire's stomach growls]

426
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,308
They were hit by mold.

427
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:12,578
Would you please, please just finish it?

428
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,246
Well, if you don't want it.

429
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,354
Oh, this is good.

430
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,293
So, according to the [inaudible

431
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,796
Yield will start recovering next season.

432
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:35,133
But it will take five to seven years to come back completely.

433
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,335
This is all your idea?

434
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,170
Is there something wrong with it?

435
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,504
No, no.

436
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,340
The changes you suggested are very good.

437
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,542
Do you think the distributor will go for them?

438
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:44,376
Yep.

439
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,044
Well, how can you be so sure?

440
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,180
Because it's a done deal.

441
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,748
They agreed last week.

442
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:58,023
Thank you.

443
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:01,393
We're back.

444
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,195
Got any plans for the night?

445
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:04,096
Well, I have my, um--

446
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,497
Change them.

447
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,132
I need you to come to dinner with me.

448
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:08,967
Well, since you've asked so sweetly,

449
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,636
what girl could resist?

450
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,304
I need to work out why Bernier wants

451
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,239
to buy into a vineyard that hasn't been producing

452
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:15,874
and won't be for years.

453
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:17,542
What does Denny think?

454
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:20,712
Whatever Margo wants him to.

455
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,047
You are paranoid.

456
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,049
Unlike my brother, I don't keep my brains in my pants.

457
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:27,586
And since you're the only person around here that I trust,

458
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:30,022
you get to come to the ball.

459
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,024
[music playing]

460
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,973
Just leave everything to me.

461
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,447
Spa Renova?

462
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:56,748
What are we doing here?

463
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:59,384
I don't want Bernier thinking we're hicks.

464
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,354
This place better be as good as Lori said.

465
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:05,424
Total spa makeover from your toes to your mind--

466
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:09,394
haircut and color, facial, manicure, pedicure,

467
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:12,397
full leg wax, bikini wax, exfoliation,

468
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:17,035
makeup and seaweed body wrap.

469
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:18,637
We'll take it all.

470
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,439
Can we skip the seaweed body wrap?

471
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,641
[music playing]

472
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:39,991
Mr. Montana left this for you.

473
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:43,061
He'll be waiting downstairs when you're ready.

474
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:43,995
Thank you.

475
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,903
Oh, that feels wonderful.

476
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:53,872
[music playing]

477
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:15,861
Why are you trying to hide your face?

478
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:16,995
Wait!

479
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:19,898
How long have you worn your hair like this?

480
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:21,333
Since high school.

481
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,068
- Hm. - Wait!

482
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:27,038
Don't you think you've waited long enough?

483
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:27,973
Ah!

484
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,008
Oh, no you don't!

485
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:30,942
Can I see, please?

486
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:33,445
Sit still.

487
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:37,482
Did they ask Picasso to show his works in progress?

488
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,651
[music playing]

489
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,207
Excuse me.

490
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:03,608
Where is she?

491
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,243
Patience, Mr. Montana.

492
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:06,478
These things take time.

493
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:09,047
[music playing]

494
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,310
What do you think, Mr. Montana?

495
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,712
Think?

496
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:46,685
I think, I think I barely recognize you.

497
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,287
As good as that?

498
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:50,856
[laughing]

499
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:52,858
[music playing]

500
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,585
Not Medusa.

501
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,653
Why, you don't like it?

502
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:22,621
They'll never let me in.

503
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:23,955
They're so snobby here.

504
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:26,725
Apparently, it's one of Denny's favorite places.

505
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:27,726
Good evening, ma'am.

506
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:29,928
Welcome to Medusa.

507
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:33,231
We hope you enjoy your evening.

508
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:35,300
Yeah, real snobby.

509
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,401
Good evening.

510
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,770
You are Mr.-- - Montana.

511
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,704
We have a reservation.

512
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:41,473
Ah yes, of course.

513
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,408
The rest of your party has already arrived.

514
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:44,309
Follow me.

515
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,219
I can't wait to see the look on Denny's face.

516
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,353
And you?

517
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:56,821
- Chicken fried steak. - Oh, wow.

518
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:58,023
Huh?

519
00:25:58,123 --> 00:25:59,357
He's been here two days, and look at his date.

520
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:00,825
[chuckles]

521
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:06,631
This is Denny's older brother, Regan, and, uh, Claire.

522
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,233
She's gorgeous.

523
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,701
I never noticed.

524
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:11,670
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

525
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,837
I had to go to change.

526
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:19,544
Mr. Bernier, I'm Regan, Denny's older brother.

527
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:20,512
This is Claire.

528
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:21,646
Barnard.

529
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,882
Please call me Jean-Marc.

530
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:27,352
Claire is Denny's paralegal.

531
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:28,253
Enchante.

532
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:36,027
Jean-Marc, I don't think you know enough about our wine.

533
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:37,762
Napa Hills is considered one of the three

534
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:39,597
best labels in America.

535
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:41,199
Of course.

536
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:44,402
I fully appreciate the stature of the Napa Hills label.

537
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:46,404
Well then, you understand my caution.

538
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:47,405
There's a lot at stake here.

539
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:48,340
For me, too.

540
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:52,644
It's all right.

541
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,245
It's no problem.

542
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:57,248
I'm planning on staying in San Francisco for the week,

543
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:58,350
until the deed is closed.

544
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,918
Great.

545
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,753
Hey, hey, why don't we go up to the vineyard this weekend?

546
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,688
We can sign the deal there.

547
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,391
I don't want you to waste your time, Jean-Marc.

548
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:09,427
It could take longer.

549
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:12,030
My jet lag just caught up with me.

550
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,698
Ah, it was a pleasure meeting you.

551
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,101
No, no, it's been such a lovely evening up to now.

552
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:17,369
The night is young.

553
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,903
It's a shame to end like this.

554
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,472
You don't have to go yet, Regan.

555
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,507
Yeah, come on, hub?

556
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:24,142
What do you have in mind, Jean-Marc?

557
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:25,910
Well, in Paris we would go to someplace

558
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:28,980
relaxed where we would get to know each other better.

559
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,150
The evening would have just started.

560
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,152
[jazz music playing]

561
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:03,648
[laughs] What's your brother up to?

562
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:05,283
Oh, he's just being Regan.

563
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,318
It's proof that anything I can do, he can do better.

564
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,921
Ah, I hope he won't be too difficult because I don't

565
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:13,391
have another buyer waiting.

566
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:15,326
Do you mind if I borrow Claire for one dance.

567
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:16,494
Oh, not at all.

568
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:19,097
Enjoy yourself.

569
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:22,500
Be careful, monsieur, you're far too generous.

570
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,369
Oh, I'm not worried.

571
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:26,037
I trust Clair completely.

572
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:29,407
Yes, Regan and I know exactly where we stand with each other.

573
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,855
So you see, my family is very important to me.

574
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:48,226
There's nothing more important.

575
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:54,599
Even though it's difficult for us being separated,

576
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:58,369
no matter where we are, we still talk several times a week.

577
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:12,250
[applause]

578
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,418
I envy you, Regan.

579
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:14,886
She's a marvelous dancer.

580
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,662
Do you mind if I cut in?

581
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:25,597
Of course.

582
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:26,498
No.

583
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:36,407
Why don't we dance, Regan?

584
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:37,408
Why not?

585
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:51,389
Have you always been like this outside of the office?

586
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:52,891
I'm no different.

587
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:55,760
It's just a dress and a haircut.

588
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,761
Woo!

589
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:58,363
[laughter]

590
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,133
It's more than that.

591
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:04,702
Have I been taking you for granted?

592
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,705
That's me-- old, reliable Claire.

593
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:10,175
Just another piece of office furniture.

594
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:12,610
I know you're suspicious about the merger,

595
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:13,778
but it's a good deal.

596
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:16,447
You'll never get another one as good.

597
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,316
Well, I need to be sure of that in my own way.

598
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:19,284
Hm.

599
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:20,618
If you take too long to decide, then

600
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:22,487
he'll move on to another deal.

601
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:28,993
I love this song.

602
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:34,465
Would you mind terribly if I ditched you for your brother?

603
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,935
Would it matter if I did?

604
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:40,305
[laughs] I'm sorry.

605
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:41,239
Do you mind?

606
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:56,321
[laughter]

607
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,490
So what did you find out, everything?

608
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:00,458
Not much.

609
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:05,096
Bernier thinks we're an item.

610
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:08,666
So whisper in my ear like you my date, not my accountant.

611
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,505
He talks a lot, but he's very careful.

612
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,941
I don't know that he said anything important.

613
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,148
All I really know is that Jean-Marc

614
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:26,484
has six brothers and sisters still living in Algeria.

615
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,122
That's where he's from originally, not France.

616
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,238
Wow!

617
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:52,410
Whoa, what happened to you?

618
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,012
You look great.

619
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,079
Very funny.

620
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:56,281
What are you still doing up?

621
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:57,115
It's late.

622
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:59,384
She lost 473 toothpicks.

623
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,085
Just giving her a chance to get even.

624
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:03,288
Ah, that's very generous of you.

625
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:05,857
Sorry, I should have insisted he go to bed.

626
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:08,293
No, no, no, no. Thank you for staying with him.

627
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,862
I didn't think I was going to be so late.

628
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:13,431
So how was your date?

629
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:14,499
It wasn't a date.

630
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,700
It was business.

631
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,302
You had a date with Denny?

632
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:18,970
No, with Regan.

633
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,805
- Who's Regan? - Denny's brother.

634
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:21,873
It wasn't a date.

635
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:22,874
Sure it was.

636
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:25,543
Where did you go?

637
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:28,913
We went to Medusa's, and then we went dancing.

638
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:30,448
Whoa, wait a minute.

639
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:32,550
You went dancing with Denny's brother?

640
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:33,685
That's a date.

641
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:34,752
Say good night, Sean.

642
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:35,653
Good night, Sean.

643
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:37,488
[chuckles]

644
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:41,859
Thanks, Lori.

645
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:42,760
Good night.

646
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,695
Good night.

647
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,733
[music playing]

648
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:19,330
I don't care what Bernier wants.

649
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,367
The deal's not good enough. - Oh, come on.

650
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,736
We get the cash we need upfront, a management

651
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,638
contract, and mother gets to go on living in the house.

652
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:28,973
What don't you like?

653
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:30,942
His so-called management contract, for one.

654
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:33,010
The clause regarding operational control

655
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:34,212
is completely one-sided.

656
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:35,680
Oh, you're the great negotiator.

657
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,148
You fix it.

658
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:40,685
But don't tell me you care about operational control.

659
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:45,656
Listen, I'm just looking out for the family's interests

660
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:47,592
since no one else is.

661
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,293
You sound just like dad.

662
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:52,430
Nobody knows how to do anything but you.

663
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,499
It took three generations to build up the reputation

664
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:55,600
of Napa Hills wines.

665
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,068
Now, you just can't turn your back on that.

666
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,169
Well, isn't that what you did 10 years

667
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:01,139
ago when you went to London?

668
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:02,907
Tell me something, Regan, are you

669
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,742
here now to run the vineyard?

670
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,353
Yeah, that's what I thought.

671
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:16,854
You're here on a day pass.

672
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:27,799
$2,700.

673
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:28,766
For one dress?

674
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:30,101
No way.

675
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,003
And that's cheap, compared to the necklace.

676
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:34,705
Well, that's one thing he's not going to have to pay for.

677
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:36,174
Can you return this at lunchtime and get

678
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:37,775
them to credit the account?

679
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,377
But it's so beautiful.

680
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:50,488
Claire.

681
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,423
I need you.

682
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:53,357
Now.

683
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,029
Why should I help you undermine Denny?

684
00:34:58,129 --> 00:34:59,831
No one's undermining Denny.

685
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:03,701
It's the best thing for him, he just doesn't know it yet.

686
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:06,404
Are you ever wrong?

687
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:09,073
My father left us equal shares in the vineyard--

688
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:10,174
40% each.

689
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,375
Mother owns the rest.

690
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:13,478
So whoever convinces your mother--

691
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:15,580
She would never side with one of us against the other--

692
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,714
father knew that.

693
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:18,449
Forcing Denny and me to agree on something

694
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:21,986
was his last little joke.

695
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:26,958
So, I have an idea.

696
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,327
Right now Margo is driving this merger.

697
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:32,063
We have to help Denny make up his own mind.

698
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:32,997
You mean do what you want?

699
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:33,931
No.

700
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:36,067
I mean do what's best.

701
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,902
Now, we have to delay the deal until we

702
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:40,371
can strengthen our hand and convince Denny that I'm right.

703
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,274
Now, we can stall by hardening our bargaining position,

704
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:46,410
then pry Denny away from Margo so he'll listen to me.

705
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:47,778
Good luck with that one.

706
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,280
We have to do it.

707
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,516
She's got him convinced that Bernier's the only buyer.

708
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:53,551
Well, how are you going to do that?

709
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,785
Well, I have a secret weapon--

710
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:00,591
you.

711
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:01,526
Excuse me?

712
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:03,094
You can get Denny away from Margo.

713
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:04,428
That's ridiculous.

714
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:05,563
I saw the way he looked at you last night.

715
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:06,964
I've seen the way you look at him.

716
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:07,999
- What are you talking about? - Oh.

717
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,367
Well, maybe I'm wrong.

718
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:10,501
You probably like running his errands for him.

719
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:11,736
There is no way Denny would ever--

720
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:12,937
When I'm through with you, Denny will

721
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:14,071
be eating out of your hands.

722
00:36:14,171 --> 00:36:15,373
You expect me to turn into Margo?

723
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:16,507
No. Margo's attractive.

724
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:18,442
You'll be, uh, bewitching.

725
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:19,710
That's what it will take.

726
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:20,478
Listen to me.

727
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:21,746
Denny is very competitive.

728
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,281
If You figured you were in love with me,

729
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:24,715
you would be irresistible.

730
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,855
I couldn't.

731
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:32,857
Tell me he's not what you've been dreaming of.

732
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:35,726
Look, you help me, I help you, everybody wins,

733
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:37,862
including Denny.

734
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:41,566
Besides, you'd be good for him.

735
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:44,669
Don't you ever go after what you want?

736
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:47,371
You don't know anything about my life.

737
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:49,373
There are some people that don't have the time or the money

738
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:50,541
to always do what they want.

739
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,243
This is not about money.

740
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:55,947
It's about desire, taking what you want.

741
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,516
What about living with the choices that we make?

742
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:00,484
I made a choice to stay with my family.

743
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,386
You ran off to London. DENNY: Regan?

744
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:04,455
And you have to decide right now.

745
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:08,025
What are you doing?

746
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:08,993
DENNY: Regan?

747
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:10,795
We're an item, remember?

748
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,563
Well, everybody has to make sacrifices.

749
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:13,497
Yeah.

750
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,137
Oh, uh--

751
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,172
Excuse me.

752
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,507
I, I didn't mean to interrupt.

753
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:25,810
I just, uh, Claire, things are piling up.

754
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,011
Sorry.

755
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:29,981
Yeah, we were just making plans for, for later.

756
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,049
Yeah, I could see that.

757
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:33,751
But did the mortgages come back?

758
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:35,820
They should have. I'll get right on it.

759
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,021
Yeah, all right.

760
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:39,023
I got to call London anyway. (WHISPERING) Listen,

761
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:40,258
can you work late tonight?

762
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:41,392
Uh-huh.

763
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:53,771
Hey, bro, take it easy on her.

764
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:55,806
Claire's not as sophisticated as your London women.

765
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:07,084
Mm, I love Szechuan.

766
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:09,253
Mm, I didn't know about this.

767
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:10,521
You don't like it?

768
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:13,958
Here, try the chicken.

769
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:15,226
Uh, no, thanks.

770
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:17,895
I meant Bernier's financial statements.

771
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:19,397
What's the problem?

772
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:20,364
He's got lots of cash.

773
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,265
He's looking to expand.

774
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:22,233
Mm, yeah, I know.

775
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:23,267
We're a bargain.

776
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,369
It just can't be that simple.

777
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,637
Are you going to eat that?

778
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:33,077
Well, I thought we're good friends now--

779
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:34,845
you know, co-conspirators?

780
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:42,319
Well, I got to thinking, too.

781
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,587
I found something on the internet

782
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:47,291
when I decided to check up on Bernier.

783
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:50,494
Last year it seems he sold four times as much wine as he could

784
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:52,697
have grown on his holdings.

785
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:53,631
Go on.

786
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:58,636
When I was in college, I used to drink Algerian wine.

787
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:00,304
Mm, at every student party.

788
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:01,305
It was awful.

789
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:03,574
It was all we could afford.

790
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:06,477
Remember his cousins in Algeria?

791
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:10,181
Well, you don't think he's been bottling Algerian wine

792
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,782
and selling it as something else?

793
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:13,384
Well, that would explain why he wants to buy more holdings

794
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:14,585
and doesn't care about the yield.

795
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,820
All he wants is the Napa Hills label.

796
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,755
He has his own secret wine supply.

797
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,690
And he needs to make it look legit.

798
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:20,424
We got him!

799
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,493
I could kiss you!

800
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:24,228
You really should try some of this chicken.

801
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:25,229
- I'm really not hungry. - Oh, no, go on.

802
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:26,497
Just taste it. - Please--

803
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:27,631
- It's fabulous. - --I'm really not hungry.

804
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:29,133
Please-- [gasps] Oh, I'm sorry.

805
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,434
- No, no, really-- - No, please.

806
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,268
--it's fine. I'll--

807
00:39:31,368 --> 00:39:32,336
No, it'll stain.

808
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:33,571
I'll just send it out tomorrow.

809
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:34,605
No, I have to take this shirt off now

810
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,141
or you can just throw it away.

811
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:38,042
OK.

812
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:38,976
OK.

813
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:49,787
I'll be right back.

814
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:08,939
Here we are.

815
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,646
You really didn't have to wash my shirt.

816
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,782
That's not part of your job.

817
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:22,353
I felt awful about bombing you with General Tso's chicken.

818
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:23,587
Hey, what a great house.

819
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:26,357
It used to be my grandmother's.

820
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:27,758
It's lucky you held onto it.

821
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:30,261
This part of town's becoming fashionable again.

822
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:31,462
Yeah, I guess.

823
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:34,698
I can't imagine living anywhere else.

824
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:36,300
Now, are you sure you don't want

825
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,803
to see Bernier's face when I hit him with our counter-proposal?

826
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:40,037
You earned it.

827
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:42,006
I'd rather Denny didn't know about my part in this.

828
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,408
There you go again--

829
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:46,076
passing up the credit for great work.

830
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:48,078
[chuckles]

831
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:02,226
You call Bernier in the morning and set up the meeting.

832
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:04,161
I won't be in until later.

833
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:06,130
[music playing]

834
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:53,010
[laughing] Twice in one week!

835
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,411
Oh, how lovely.

836
00:41:54,511 --> 00:41:56,080
It's lovely to see you, too, mother.

837
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,448
What are you doing here?

838
00:41:57,548 --> 00:42:00,517
Don't tell me you were just driving by in the neighborhood.

839
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:02,386
Well, actually, I need to borrow some wine.

840
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:03,821
I hope you don't mind. - Mind?

841
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:04,788
Not a bit.

842
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,790
I'm just so delighted you're home.

843
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,162
I see you still remember the best vintages.

844
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:13,564
I've been in London, mother.

845
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:15,065
They haven't had a stoke.

846
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:19,703
Ah, do you know that this is the very wine your father

847
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:22,706
and I drank on our 25th anniversary?

848
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:24,508
What do you need these for?

849
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:26,076
Ammunition?

850
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:27,811
I'm meeting with a Frenchman who wants to buy the vineyard.

851
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:31,181
Hm, I don't know why that makes me sad.

852
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,986
I can't help feeling like I'm letting your father down.

853
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:37,187
Do you, really?

854
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:39,790
Uh-huh.

855
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,860
Well then, maybe we shouldn't sell.

856
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,695
Then who would run the place?

857
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:46,096
Certainly not Denny.

858
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:47,598
Well, what about you?

859
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:48,866
Guess you don't want to?

860
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:55,773
Well, I won't give it away.

861
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:58,442
I think we're being low-balled.

862
00:42:58,542 --> 00:42:59,543
Where is this coming from?

863
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:01,211
Oh, come on, mother.

864
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,914
We all know that Denny's not the greatest negotiator.

865
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:06,083
You know, I think that's very unfair.

866
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:07,751
Well, you've gone along with this whole thing.

867
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:09,520
Didn't Denny send you the papers over a month ago?

868
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,688
Yes, he did.

869
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:11,689
So don't you think it's a little

870
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:12,990
late to start objecting now?

871
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,859
Mother, I just want to get the best price.

872
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,495
Another two million dollars?

873
00:43:18,595 --> 00:43:20,064
That's hardly a little adjustment.

874
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:21,999
I think you've undervalued our assets.

875
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,934
Of course, that's just a preliminary figure.

876
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:25,369
But Denny, you were happy with the price.

877
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:28,038
My brother has always been more easygoing than me.

878
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:30,240
Of course, Jean-Marc, if you don't feel our asset

879
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:31,508
mix suits your needs--

880
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,510
But your yields for the last two years,

881
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:34,545
really, they're quite low.

882
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:36,513
Well, volume is a funny thing.

883
00:43:36,613 --> 00:43:37,448
Some years it's down.

884
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:38,449
Some years it's up.

885
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:40,784
It's often hard to know why.

886
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:43,821
But you can't fake quality.

887
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:57,534
Gold medal 1921, '28, and '45, '48, '51, '66, '85--

888
00:43:57,634 --> 00:43:58,669
Yes, I see your point.

889
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:02,139
--'89 and '91.

890
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:08,612
If you could give me a few moments with Margo.

891
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:09,813
Are you crazy?

892
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:11,281
Are you trying to blow this deal?

893
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:12,583
No.

894
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:13,817
I just want to make Bernier pay a fair price

895
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:14,952
for what he's buying.

896
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:16,687
But Margo had a valuation done.

897
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:18,188
I reviewed it. It was fine.

898
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:18,956
Denny--

899
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:20,090
What if he won't counter?

900
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,825
I think he will.

901
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:23,761
Well, this is one time I hope you're right.

902
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,599
I will have to do some fancy talking

903
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:29,633
to my board of directors.

904
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:30,567
Great.

905
00:44:30,667 --> 00:44:31,702
That's good.

906
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:33,170
But it's not a sure thing, Denny.

907
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:34,571
Well, I'm confident that Jean-Marc

908
00:44:34,671 --> 00:44:36,040
can explain the benefits.

909
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,542
After all, the Napa Hills name will

910
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:41,912
suit your needs for many years.

911
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:44,948
Even at this price, it could be profitable to all of us.

912
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:47,918
I hope I can convince them.

913
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,186
Yeah.

914
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:52,389
You know, I think Margo should go over for a few days

915
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:54,024
to help with the presentation.

916
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:55,325
I'm afraid that will be difficult.

917
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:56,994
I have another deal that's about to close.

918
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:58,629
No, that would help. You know me.

919
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:00,297
You know the region. You know the vineyard.

920
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:02,599
And it would only be for one or two days.

921
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,734
We're so close.

922
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:09,273
I will have to make a phone call.

923
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,274
How long will you need?

924
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,975
I've called a special board meeting.

925
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:14,545
Well, it has to be decided by the end of next week, one

926
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:15,546
way or the other.

927
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:17,014
Then, great.

928
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:19,049
And we sign the papers up at the vineyard this week.

929
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:27,291
I feel awful.

930
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,292
Why?

931
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,561
You just helped Denny find $2 million.

932
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:32,229
Then why do I feel so bad?

933
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:35,866
I know how to fix that.

934
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:39,103
Come on, we're going shopping.

935
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:40,537
If you're going to play my girlfriend,

936
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:41,538
you need a wardrobe.

937
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:43,640
I already have a wardrobe.

938
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,342
I am painfully aware of that.

939
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:47,478
I mean, a wardrobe to impress my brother.

940
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,378
Come on.

941
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:06,830
Regan, these are so expensive.

942
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:07,765
Who cares?

943
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:09,833
We had Bernier pay.

944
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,469
We should have asked for $4 million.

945
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:14,338
Go. Try on.

946
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:25,382
Mm.

947
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:26,316
I like it.

948
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:27,785
You like it?

949
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:28,719
It's all right.

950
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:29,787
Really?

951
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,288
- No, I like it. - You should do.

952
00:46:31,388 --> 00:46:32,289
You look great.

953
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:33,290
Yeah?

954
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:34,691
We'll take it.

955
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,894
[music playing]

956
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:43,667
[laughing]

957
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:44,668
Yeah, right.

958
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:45,803
I think it's a bit much.

959
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:47,771
Yeah, I think it's a no.

960
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:49,940
[music playing]

961
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:00,951
What do you think?

962
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:02,819
I think it's stunning.

963
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,755
[giggles] I'm going to get it.

964
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:06,690
I think you might like this one, too, sir.

965
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:07,591
I think I might.

966
00:47:07,691 --> 00:47:09,560
[music playing]

967
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:19,369
Do you like it?

968
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:20,904
I love it.

969
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,172
Not too funky?

970
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:22,973
No.

971
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:25,742
[inaudible

972
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,311
We'll take it.

973
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:30,314
[laughs]

974
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:31,848
Mm, good.

975
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:33,750
You'll need this since you and Denny spend so much

976
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,786
time together in the office.

977
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:38,622
Why?

978
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:40,824
Well, we can't break the illusion.

979
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:41,858
What are you afraid of?

980
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:44,328
He's already seen the real me.

981
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:48,665
Why are you so certain that was the real you?

982
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:50,033
Here we are.

983
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:52,369
It's our finest silk.

984
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:53,670
Regan, please.

985
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:55,872
Well, you'll need this for your weekend at the house.

986
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:58,675
I'll put them in your fitting room.

987
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,845
This is all so expensive.

988
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:04,448
Well, I think of it as an investment.

989
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:15,859
Can you unzip me, please?

990
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:16,994
Of course.

991
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:26,670
[telephone ringing]

992
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:33,577
Blaine Alexander Couture.

993
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:34,945
Yes.

994
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:37,514
Oh, did he?

995
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:39,516
Oh, that's wonderful.

996
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:41,718
Yes, let me get that.

997
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:43,453
Three?

998
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:45,422
[knock on door]

999
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,461
I, I, I'm so sorry.

1000
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:52,496
I really had no idea.

1001
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:55,098
No, I thought you were the salesclerk.

1002
00:48:55,198 --> 00:48:59,736
Um, I thought you might like this.

1003
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:00,704
It's gorgeous.

1004
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,075
Oh, um.

1005
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:07,244
[music playing]

1006
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:18,488
Regan?

1007
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:20,891
Uh, yes?

1008
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:22,059
Thank you.

1009
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:25,529
This has been a wonderful afternoon.

1010
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:28,131
Yes, it has been fun.

1011
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:31,234
Are you still there?

1012
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:32,669
Yeah.

1013
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:35,372
This new dress, I think I need help with the zipper.

1014
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,374
[music playing]

1015
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:14,745
Oh!

1016
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,146
Um--

1017
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:18,949
How we doing?

1018
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:20,484
Uh, yeah, it looks, it looks great.

1019
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:21,385
Thank you.

1020
00:50:57,954 --> 00:50:59,022
He's the guy?

1021
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:01,291
Well, I-- guilty, I guess.

1022
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,426
Sean.

1023
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:04,027
I'm glad to meet you, because Claire's been

1024
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:06,096
acting really weird lately.

1025
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:08,865
I thought my real sister was kidnapped by aliens.

1026
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:10,567
I'm not that lucky.

1027
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:13,336
Regan Montana, meet my brother Sean.

1028
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:14,805
Hi.

1029
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,073
Hi.

1030
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:18,375
Here, come on in.

1031
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:23,180
Um, I'm going to put these things away.

1032
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:30,287
Sean, offer Regan a drink.

1033
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:48,205
Scotch or gin?

1034
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:49,806
Really iced tea.

1035
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:51,475
These are your parents?

1036
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:52,542
Yeah.

1037
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:55,612
They died in a car crash when I was seven.

1038
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:56,513
I didn't know that.

1039
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:57,447
I'm sorry.

1040
00:52:00,116 --> 00:52:01,218
Yeah.

1041
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:02,953
Claire's kind of touchy about it though.

1042
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:04,921
She doesn't talk about them much.

1043
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:05,822
Don't worry.

1044
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:06,756
I'll be careful.

1045
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:12,796
[sighs] Here's mud in your eye.

1046
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:15,532
Here's looking at you, sir.

1047
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:22,172
Claire says you're a big London lawyer.

1048
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:23,440
Well, I live in London.

1049
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,276
I don't know how big I am.

1050
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:27,210
Here, have a, have a seat.

1051
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,311
Thank you.

1052
00:52:31,948 --> 00:52:33,550
Claire's going to be a lawyer, too, you know.

1053
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,585
Well, she's certainly got the brains for it.

1054
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:37,888
Yeah, she says we're going to go to law school together.

1055
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:42,425
Only if you live long enough to graduate from high school.

1056
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:43,226
What?

1057
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:46,129
You talk too much.

1058
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:48,498
Listen, we have to go back to the office.

1059
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:49,299
Now?

1060
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:50,667
You going to be OK?

1061
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:52,235
Sure, I'll be fine.

1062
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:56,940
I'll, uh, I'll try to have her back early, sir.

1063
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,809
Just see that you do, young man.

1064
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:01,778
[giggles]

1065
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:03,780
[music playing]

1066
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:29,105
Claire!

1067
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:31,107
Where have you been?

1068
00:53:31,207 --> 00:53:35,612
Would you just get the papers for the Handsworth closing?

1069
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:37,747
Claire, he needs these, too.

1070
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:42,519
Here you go.

1071
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:43,520
Thanks.

1072
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:44,854
Sorry, I let things get backed up.

1073
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:45,989
It's OK.

1074
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:47,624
I know how hard it is.

1075
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:50,393
Regan's some kind of irresistible force.

1076
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:52,596
And here are the corporate year-end files.

1077
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:53,530
Oh!

1078
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:54,464
Thank you.

1079
00:53:57,634 --> 00:54:00,337
You know, I never realized just how

1080
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:02,539
much work you do around here.

1081
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:05,075
I'm afraid I've been taking you for granted.

1082
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:06,776
What are you still doing here?

1083
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:08,478
I thought you were taking Margo to the airport.

1084
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:11,448
Just wrapping things up first, you stealing my paralegal

1085
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:12,949
all day and all night.

1086
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:13,850
Well, sorry about that.

1087
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,752
She IS invaluable.

1088
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:18,355
Yeah, she sure is.

1089
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:20,357
You two going to work late tonight?

1090
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:21,758
It's hard to say.

1091
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:23,226
We've got to be ready for when Bernier comes back.

1092
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:24,361
IF he comes back.

1093
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:25,629
He'll be back.

1094
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:26,696
Bank on it.

1095
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:29,299
And I can't do it without Claire's help.

1096
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:33,536
You know, until I got here, I don't think

1097
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:37,340
you really appreciated her.

1098
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,908
[crickets chirping]

1099
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:43,380
[tv on in the background]

1100
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:51,054
You could have stayed at the office, you know.

1101
00:54:51,154 --> 00:54:52,422
That's no problem.

1102
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:54,724
I knew you didn't want to leave Sean alone.

1103
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:57,127
Thanks, but he's becoming pretty self-reliant.

1104
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:58,161
Hm.

1105
00:54:58,261 --> 00:55:00,664
Yeah, you could even say, um--

1106
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:03,433
Overprotective?

1107
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:04,834
I guess that's how brothers are.

1108
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:11,174
You know, you were great with Denny today.

1109
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:12,542
I didn't do anything.

1110
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:14,411
He was practically tripping over his tongue.

1111
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:15,512
Oh, please.

1112
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:20,984
So, with Margo out of the way for the next few days--

1113
00:55:21,084 --> 00:55:23,219
and say thank you--

1114
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:25,188
the field is clear.

1115
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:27,424
The boy is at your mercy.

1116
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:28,792
But if the deal's all settled.

1117
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:31,294
Don't believe it. it's not settled.

1118
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:32,996
Who knows what Bernier's going to come back with,

1119
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:34,330
and I need Denny onside.

1120
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:36,199
I can't have him listening to whatever Margo's

1121
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:37,901
going to whisper in his ear.

1122
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:40,336
So this is just business?

1123
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:41,971
Come on, Claire, for me it is.

1124
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:43,006
That doesn't matter.

1125
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:45,942
It's what you want, isn't it?

1126
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:47,143
Let's just go for it.

1127
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:51,381
All right, I will.

1128
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,019
What?

1129
00:55:56,119 --> 00:56:00,523
Listen, we make a good team.

1130
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:06,029
But just remember, don't throw yourself at him.

1131
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:07,030
Let him come to you.

1132
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:17,941
Do you have the Bernier revenues for '93?

1133
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,877
It's right here.

1134
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:23,613
Good.

1135
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,348
Ooh, honey, admit it.

1136
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:26,916
You're in love.

1137
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:27,617
What?

1138
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:29,619
You're a changed woman.

1139
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,454
No, it's just clothes and a haircut.

1140
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:33,056
I'm not talking about that.

1141
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:34,424
I'm talking about you.

1142
00:56:34,524 --> 00:56:36,025
He shows up a week ago and he's--

1143
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:37,293
He? As in Regan?

1144
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:38,361
Uh-huh.

1145
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:39,963
No way.

1146
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:42,665
Say what you want, girl, but you look like a woman in love.

1147
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:47,437
Good morning.

1148
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:48,538
Good morning, Mr. Montana.

1149
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:50,273
Good morning.

1150
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:51,875
OK, what have we got here?

1151
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:52,776
There you go.

1152
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:54,210
[beep]

1153
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:55,478
Yes?

1154
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,013
Claire, could you come in here, please?

1155
00:56:57,113 --> 00:56:57,947
Right away.

1156
00:56:58,047 --> 00:56:58,882
Claire, I need you.

1157
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:07,223
Uh, listen.

1158
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:13,863
I'm sorry if I was a little insensitive yesterday.

1159
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:19,102
Um, my father always used to say that I was intense.

1160
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:20,403
Yeah, Ayatollah's intense.

1161
00:57:20,503 --> 00:57:21,704
I don't think they have a word for you yet.

1162
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:28,311
Well, I got you a little something.

1163
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:30,413
I don't need anymore presents.

1164
00:57:30,513 --> 00:57:33,483
Let's just call this your graduation gown?

1165
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:34,617
Go on, open it.

1166
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:43,693
Wow.

1167
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:48,198
It's for your first date with Denny.

1168
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:51,467
He'll be putty in your hands.

1169
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:53,002
Oh, and, uh--

1170
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:57,941
What's this?

1171
00:57:58,041 --> 00:57:59,475
Basketball tickets?

1172
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:01,611
Not just any basketball tickets, floor seats

1173
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:03,179
to the Warriors.

1174
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:05,481
I had to call in favors I've been saving since university.

1175
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:07,183
Well that will be a really romantic date.

1176
00:58:07,283 --> 00:58:08,318
Won't I be overdressed?

1177
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:10,653
No, they're for Sean and a friend.

1178
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:11,921
Aw, that's sweet.

1179
00:58:22,198 --> 00:58:24,067
You guys are going to have to stop that.

1180
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:27,303
All that passion is hard on a lonely bachelor.

1181
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:28,271
I got the wrong lease.

1182
00:58:28,371 --> 00:58:30,206
I need the Pyratemp lease.

1183
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:32,175
[music playing]

1184
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:42,986
CLAIRE: Good morning.

1185
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:45,889
LORI: Oh, thanks.

1186
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:46,923
Oh!

1187
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,558
Cappuccino!

1188
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:49,492
Where's Regan?

1189
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:51,160
Out of town.

1190
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:54,230
Something about some depositions he had to take in LA.

1191
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:55,765
Oh.

1192
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:58,101
There was a message when I got in, I assumed from you.

1193
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:09,712
Thank you.

1194
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:18,821
So, Regan's had to go out of town?

1195
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:20,423
Welcome to the big time.

1196
00:59:20,523 --> 00:59:21,991
Something came up.

1197
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:24,160
Oh, let's look on the bright side--

1198
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,096
we can catch up on work.

1199
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:34,771
And then maybe you and I could, I don't know,

1200
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:38,041
console each other over a nice dinner and a bottle of wine?

1201
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:39,976
Why not.

1202
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,678
Yeah?

1203
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:43,546
No, that sounds fine to me.

1204
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:45,315
How about 7 o'clock?

1205
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:46,716
Tonight?

1206
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:50,353
Yeah, I was planning on being hungry tonight--

1207
00:59:50,453 --> 00:59:53,323
and in need of a little consolation.

1208
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,758
Well, it's just that I haven't seen much of Sean lately,

1209
00:59:55,858 --> 00:59:57,126
and I thought I'd--

1210
00:59:57,226 --> 00:59:57,860
Sure.

1211
00:59:57,961 --> 00:59:59,762
I'm used to rejection.

1212
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:01,364
Like you mope around every night.

1213
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:03,366
[laughter]

1214
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:10,173
How about tomorrow night?

1215
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,107
Perfect.

1216
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:21,250

1219
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:47,310
You've got four dogs now?

1220
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:48,211
Yeah.

1221
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,380
Six on weekends.

1222
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,082
$50 a week.

1223
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:54,951
Where's Regan?

1224
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:56,319
Why?

1225
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:59,288
I'm just wondered why you're hanging out with me tonight.

1226
01:00:59,389 --> 01:01:00,957
Ha, he's out of town.

1227
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:02,225
[barking]

1228
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:04,594
That's too bad.

1229
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:06,729
He's way cool.

1230
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,931
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

1231
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:11,667
Nobody else could have scored those Warrior tickets.

1232

[telephone ringing]

1234
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:23,446
Did I wake you?

1235
01:01:23,546 --> 01:01:25,381
No.

1236
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:28,518
No, I figured you'd probably just go back in.

1237
01:01:28,618 --> 01:01:30,286
So how's it going?

1238
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:31,587
You're sick.

1239
01:01:31,687 --> 01:01:32,955
First you leave without saying goodbye,

1240
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:36,025
and now you call up wanting a play by play.

1241
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:37,293
You're going to be disappointed.

1242
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:39,495
No, I wasn't really expecting that much--

1243
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:40,530
not on a first date.

1244
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:41,497
You're not that kind of girl.

1245
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:46,636
So what happened?

1246
01:01:46,736 --> 01:01:48,337
Nothing.

1247
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:49,639
Absolutely nothing?

1248
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:51,074
Don't worry, we haven't gone out yet.

1249
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:52,909
- What, he didn't ask you? - He asked me.

1250
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:54,143
I turned him down.

1251
01:01:54,243 --> 01:01:55,111
What?

1252
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:56,345
Just following my mentor's advice.

1253
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:58,114
Making him wait one more night.

1254
01:01:58,214 --> 01:01:59,749
Good.

1255
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:01,017
So, where's he taking you?

1256
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:03,386
He's going to cook for me at his place.

1257
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:05,455
He's a gourmet cook, you know?

1258
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,857
Well, that's very good.

1259
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:10,293
I'm so glad you approve.

1260
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,295
[music playing]

1261
01:03:16,792 --> 01:03:18,161
Come on, you're going to be late!

1262
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:22,198
All right, all right, all right, all right.

1263
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:24,200
Ah!

1264
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,636
This one?

1265
01:03:26,736 --> 01:03:27,837
Ah.

1266
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:31,174
Sean, can you come zip me up, please?

1267
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:33,943
All right.

1268
01:03:34,043 --> 01:03:35,144
There you go.

1269
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:37,513
Look great.

1270
01:03:37,613 --> 01:03:40,249
You must think I'm a real dope.

1271
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:45,421
I've known you for four years, and I never really saw you.

1272
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:47,456
Were you and Regan close as children?

1273
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:48,591
Hm.

1274
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:49,759
When we weren't fighting, we were

1275
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:52,929
fiercely devoted to each other.

1276
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:54,330
Why did he leave home?

1277
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:56,799
From the time he was a teenager, he and my father

1278
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:58,868
fought about everything.

1279
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:00,803
Sounds like he was an unhappy child.

1280
01:04:00,903 --> 01:04:03,139
No, I think he just felt that his whole life

1281
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:05,007
was ruled by being a Montana.

1282
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:07,910
My father had all these plans for him.

1283
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,478
What about you?

1284
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:12,248
As long as I stayed off the streets and out of jail,

1285
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:13,382
he was happy.

1286
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:14,750
That's not true.

1287
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:16,719
Not specifically.

1288
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:19,055
He never really expected that much from me.

1289
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:22,692
But Regan-- my father had it all laid out for him.

1290
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:23,593
Just be careful, Claire.

1291
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:27,697
What are you saying?

1292
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:29,498
Regan's not big on commitment.

1293
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:30,967
He won't even buy green bananas.

1294
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:38,074
I can't get over the view from here.

1295
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:56,592
And neither can I. How could I have taken you for granted?

1296
01:04:56,692 --> 01:04:57,493
Hm?

1297
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:03,466
Without you, I'd have been lost.

1298
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,629
It's getting cold.

1299
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:35,631
Let's come inside.

1301
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:03,592
I don't know.

1302
01:06:03,693 --> 01:06:05,161
It's getting late.

1303
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:08,998
Well, we have years of wasted opportunity to make up for.

1304
01:06:09,098 --> 01:06:10,032
Some cognac?

1305
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:11,434
Just a small one.

1306

[music playing]

1307
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:26,315
An end to wasted opportunities.

1308
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:35,658
Ooh.

1309

1311
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,122
Shouldn't you get that?

1312
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:08,057
It's got to be a mistake.

1313
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:10,393
They'll go away.

1314
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:12,361

1316
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:23,472
It's just the Boy Scouts, their annual drive, clothing drive.

1317
01:07:23,572 --> 01:07:25,207
At this hour?

1318
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:27,376
[pounding on door]

1319
01:07:33,149 --> 01:07:34,617
This better be good.

1320
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:41,023
I hope my timing's not too inconvenient.

1321
01:07:41,123 --> 01:07:42,158
No.

1322
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:45,027
We were just about to have dessert.

1323
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:46,295
What are you doing here?

1324
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:47,329
What are you doing here?

1325
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:48,597
I thought you were in LA.

1326
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:50,866
I needed Denny to initial some changes,

1327
01:07:50,966 --> 01:07:52,535
and it seems damn lucky that I did.

1328
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:54,703
I leave you alone for one night--

1329
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:55,871
Just calm down, bro.

1330
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:58,240
You haven't changed a bit. Come on.

1331
01:07:58,340 --> 01:07:59,442
We're getting out of here.

1332
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:00,843
But really, nothing happened.

1333
01:08:00,943 --> 01:08:01,777
Yeah, yeah, right.

1334
01:08:01,877 --> 01:08:04,213
Regan, nothing happened.

1335
01:08:04,313 --> 01:08:06,248
- What are you doing? - I don't believe him.

1336
01:08:06,348 --> 01:08:09,752
I mean, I'm not surprised, but I do not believe him!

1337
01:08:09,852 --> 01:08:11,320
You can stop pretending now.

1338
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,622
I mean, you can't even trust your brother for one night?

1339
01:08:13,722 --> 01:08:14,723
What the hell was that?

1340
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:15,691
Denny's inside.

1341
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:16,792
He can't see you.

1342
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,800
Yeah, right.

1343
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,869
So, how was dinner?

1344
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:28,304
He's a gourmet cook, you know.

1345
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:49,658
When we were upset, mom always used to give us Coke.

1346
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:52,595
That's sweet, but I don't think it's going to help.

1347
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:59,001
What if we had some brandy?

1348
01:08:59,101 --> 01:08:59,935
Now you're talking.

1349
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:08,711
No way.

1350
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:11,180
What have you got to be upset about?

1351
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:13,616
I'm upset if you had a fight with Regan.

1352
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:14,650
Regan?

1353
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:15,951
You know, the guy you've been dating?

1354
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:17,386
I'm not dating Regan.

1355
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:18,654
I was out with Denny.

1356
01:09:18,754 --> 01:09:20,789
Denny!

1357
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:23,759
If you marry Denny, I will never speak to you again.

1358
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:25,895
Well, there's not much danger of that.

1359
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:26,795
Good.

1360
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:35,404
I don't know what's the matter with me.

1361
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:37,173
For years I've been dreaming of Denny.

1362
01:09:37,273 --> 01:09:38,340
Nobody's perfect.

1363
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:39,942
And then Regan barges into my life,

1364
01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:41,777
and my heart does flip-flops.

1365
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:42,745
This is good.

1366
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:45,080
No, it's not.

1367
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:47,149
At least he's not a wimp like--

1368
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:49,184
some other people we know.

1369
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:51,820
Smart ass.

1370
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:52,988
He's driving me crazy.

1371
01:09:53,088 --> 01:09:54,390
I can't figure out what he wants.

1372
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:59,028
Hey, why don't you figure out what you want.

1373
01:09:59,128 --> 01:09:59,962
I wish I could.

1374
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:09,438
[typing]

1375
01:10:19,748 --> 01:10:21,984
Do you have to do that so loud?

1376
01:10:22,084 --> 01:10:25,187
Ooh, rough night?

1377
01:10:25,287 --> 01:10:26,956
Don't ever mix brandy and cocoa.

1378
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:31,060
Why don't you lie down?

1379
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,262
Things look pretty quiet on all fronts.

1380
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:34,530
I'll cover for you. Go on.

1381
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:36,031
DENNY: Love you. Love you.

1382
01:10:36,131 --> 01:10:37,433
Bye-bye.

1383
01:10:37,533 --> 01:10:39,201
Woo!

1384
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:40,202
Hey, Regan!

1385
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:43,539
Regan, come out here!

1386
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:46,075
I just got off the phone with Margo.

1387
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:47,109
And?

1388
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:49,144
I don't know how you do it.

1389
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,679
Bernier caved!

1390
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:51,914
Woo!

1391
01:10:52,014 --> 01:10:53,382
Great.

1392
01:10:53,482 --> 01:10:56,518
His board agreed to the whole $2 million smackeroonies.

1393
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:59,154
Woo, that is my big brother.

1394
01:10:59,254 --> 01:11:00,189
Huh?

1395
01:11:00,289 --> 01:11:02,825
He always gets what he wants!

1396
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:05,027
Congratulations.

1397
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:08,631
Hey, Bernier wants to settle the deal as soon as possible.

1398
01:11:08,731 --> 01:11:10,966
Hey, we can close the deal up at the vineyard.

1399
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:12,635
Right.

1400
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:14,236
Hey, you want to go up and tell mother?

1401
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:15,237
I'll stay here.

1402
01:11:15,337 --> 01:11:16,672
I'll bring them up tonight.

1403
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:18,207
I'm going to need Claire to come with me.

1404
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:19,241
Yeah, whatever you want, bro.

1405
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:20,509
Whatever you want!

01:11:51,373 --> 01:11:53,942
You must be very pleased.

01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:55,711
I mean, you got everything you asked for.

1412
01:12:09,058 --> 01:12:11,393
When my great grandfather came over from Holland

1413
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:15,264
and found this soil, he knew it'd be perfect.

1414
01:12:15,364 --> 01:12:18,434
You see-- it's rich, chalky.

1415
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:20,536
I never knew dirt could smell so clean.

1416
01:12:20,636 --> 01:12:22,871
When he found this slope, he pitched his tent.

1417
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:26,709
He was home.

1418
01:12:44,626 --> 01:12:47,129
Just clip it a little bit there, OK?

1419
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:48,030
Darling!

1420
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:49,832
Hello, mother.

1421
01:12:49,932 --> 01:12:52,434
Denny says that you worked it all out?

1422
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:54,103
He wanted me to tell you.

1423
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:55,003
I guess he couldn't wait.

1424
01:12:55,104 --> 01:12:55,938
I know.

1425
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:57,072
Are you happy?

1426
01:12:57,172 --> 01:12:59,174
Well, so far, so good.

1427
01:12:59,274 --> 01:13:00,576
Regan?

1428
01:13:00,676 --> 01:13:02,177
Let's just see how it all plays out, mom.

1429
01:13:02,277 --> 01:13:03,112
All right.

1430
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:04,713
Who's this?

1431
01:13:04,813 --> 01:13:05,647
Claire?

1432
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:06,415
Hi.

1433
01:13:06,515 --> 01:13:08,350
I hardly recognized you.

1434
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:09,918
You look fabulous.

1435
01:13:10,018 --> 01:13:11,587
She looks OK, but I couldn't have

1436
01:13:11,687 --> 01:13:13,021
made this deal without her.

1437
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:15,157
Well, come along. I want to hear about everything.

1438
01:13:15,257 --> 01:13:16,058
Come on.

[giggles]

1440
01:13:17,626 --> 01:13:19,294
Must be very hard for you to part with all of this.

1441
01:13:19,394 --> 01:13:21,663
Ha, no, I did that years ago.

1442
01:13:21,764 --> 01:13:23,799
Now I'm making sure I get paid for it.

[music playing]

1444
01:13:39,314 --> 01:13:41,150
My grandfather built his place.

1445
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,919
My dad never came here.

1446
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:47,122
Used to be a hideout for Denny and me.

1447
01:13:51,994 --> 01:13:55,964
You know, when I was a kid, I used

1448
01:13:56,064 --> 01:13:57,633
to come up here and imagine what my life

1449
01:13:57,733 --> 01:13:59,802
would be like when I grew up.

1450
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:01,670
You love this place so much, why did you leave?

1451
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,806
I didn't want to go.

1452
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:05,574
My dad sent me to school back east.

1453
01:14:05,674 --> 01:14:08,911
That must have been a terrific opportunity for you.

1454
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:10,279
Yeah, right.

1455
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:13,415
Well, that's the way he saw it.

1456
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:14,850
All I wanted to do was stay right here.

1457
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:19,154
But I knew it was a fight I couldn't win.

1458
01:14:19,254 --> 01:14:23,459
So I figured if he wanted me gone, I was gone--

1459
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:26,462
but on my terms.

1460
01:14:26,562 --> 01:14:30,966
After I graduated college, I just kept going--

1461
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:31,900
all the way to England.

1462
01:14:37,339 --> 01:14:39,208
I guess you showed him.

1463
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:41,210
[birds chirping]

1464
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,212
[music playing]

1465
01:15:34,396 --> 01:15:35,230
Mm.

1466
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:37,866
Mm, mm, mm.

1467
01:15:37,966 --> 01:15:40,135
Only other man that could mix a martini this good

1468
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:41,069
was your father.

1469
01:15:43,672 --> 01:15:46,608
Well, maybe it's genetic.

1470
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:47,910
Probably.

1471
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:51,313
Oh, no, the two of you were so much alike.

1472
01:15:51,413 --> 01:15:53,782
If only you could see it.

1473
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:56,451
We couldn't stand to be in the same room with each other.

1474
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:58,020
He adored you.

1475
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:00,622
Yeah, well, he sure picked a funny way to show it.

1476
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:03,592
Oh, darling, don't be too hard on him.

1477
01:16:03,692 --> 01:16:04,893
Mother, he threw me out.

1478
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:06,461
He did not throw you out.

1479
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:07,562
He sent you to Yale.

1480
01:16:07,663 --> 01:16:09,231
Yeah, to get rid of me.

1481
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:10,365
No!

1482
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:13,168
Because he knew how smart you were.

1483
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:16,838
And he wanted to give you the best education he could afford.

1484
01:16:16,939 --> 01:16:18,807
He was so proud of you.

1485
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:22,077
He used to brag about you all the time to all his friends.

1486
01:16:29,484 --> 01:16:30,619
I thought he hated me.

1487
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:33,889
Oh, no, he loved you.

1488
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:50,038
I noticed he, he planted the eastern slope in pinot noir.

1489
01:16:50,138 --> 01:16:51,340
Yes.

1490
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,642
He finally took your advice.

1491
01:16:53,742 --> 01:16:54,943
It's a fascinating grape.

1492
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:56,278
I always knew it would make good wine here.

1493
01:16:59,548 --> 01:17:01,950
Well, I guess Monsieur Bernier will find out about that,

1494
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:02,851
right?

1495
01:17:05,854 --> 01:17:08,857
Oh, darling, why don't you come home?

1496
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:11,727
Oh, mother, what for?

1497
01:17:11,827 --> 01:17:13,695
My life is in London now.

1498
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:18,967
As soon as this merger's done, I'm going back there.

1499
01:17:19,067 --> 01:17:23,105
There's nothing, nothing to keep me here.

1500
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:37,786
Yes, wait till you see it in the daylight.

1501
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:40,522
The view is spectacular.

1502
01:17:40,622 --> 01:17:41,490
Thanks.

1503
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:43,592
This is the place.

1504
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:44,826
It's beautiful, right?

1505
01:17:44,926 --> 01:17:46,495
In the morning when the sun comes up,

1506
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:47,929
it just stretches out forever.

1507
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:49,798
Come on, Margo, Bernier.

1508
01:17:49,898 --> 01:17:52,100
Come on inside.

1509
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,035
Mom!

1510
01:17:57,472 --> 01:17:59,341
[claire sobbing]

1511
01:18:04,413 --> 01:18:05,247
Claire?

1512
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:12,754
Claire.

1513
01:18:17,559 --> 01:18:18,627
Claire, what's wrong?

1514
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:21,797
I'm such a dope.

1515
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:24,433
Regan was using me to get to you.

1516
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:26,535
I know.

1517
01:18:26,635 --> 01:18:30,605
It's got to be obvious.

1518
01:18:30,705 --> 01:18:32,007
I feel like a traitor.

1519
01:18:35,077 --> 01:18:37,179
I don't know why I did it.

1520
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:39,181
He said Margo was selling you out.

1521
01:18:39,281 --> 01:18:40,949
Oh, Margo.

1522
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:44,453
Look, my brother's opinion of women isn't always too high.

1523
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:46,088
Neither was his opinion of you.

1524
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:47,889
Yeah, that too.

1525
01:18:47,989 --> 01:18:50,559
But I helped him.

1526
01:18:50,659 --> 01:18:51,493
I'm so sorry.

1527
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:57,999
Worse than that, you fell for him.

1528
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:01,536
I feel like a traitor and a fool.

1529
01:19:01,636 --> 01:19:03,205
He's not entirely without charm.

1530
01:19:11,613 --> 01:19:12,881
So what was the other night about?

1531
01:19:17,786 --> 01:19:20,388
Old habits die hard?

1532
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:23,658
Look, I, I've been in competition with him

1533
01:19:23,758 --> 01:19:25,794
since forever.

1534
01:19:25,894 --> 01:19:31,933
And I truly, I truly regret what we--

1535
01:19:32,033 --> 01:19:36,771
maybe if we started four years ago.

1536
01:19:36,872 --> 01:19:37,873
Maybe.

1537
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:42,277
Maybe I was a different girl then.

1538
01:19:47,048 --> 01:19:48,650
Why is he leaving like this?

1539
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:50,051
He's terrified.

1540
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:53,588
But I know Regan, and we can stop him.

1541
01:19:53,688 --> 01:19:55,023
I've seen the way he looks at you.

1542
01:19:55,123 --> 01:19:57,192
And if you want him to admit how he feels,

1543
01:19:57,292 --> 01:19:59,127
then we're going to have to pretend that the other night

1544
01:19:59,227 --> 01:20:00,629
was for real. - Oh, not this again.

1545
01:20:00,729 --> 01:20:01,797
That we're crazy about each other.

1546
01:20:01,897 --> 01:20:03,532
I'm sick and tired of these games.

1547
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:06,134
You got another plan?

1548
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:08,303
Well, you love him, don't you?

1549
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:23,952
No, you can't do this.

1550
01:20:24,052 --> 01:20:25,020
Where's Denny?

1551
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,388
He'll be right down.

1552
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:27,756
Why not?

1553
01:20:27,856 --> 01:20:30,692
Well, you can't change deal points we already agreed upon.

1554
01:20:30,792 --> 01:20:31,660
Morning all.

1555
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:34,629
Oh, aren't we finished yet?

1556
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:37,365
Denny, will you please talk some sense into your brother?

1557
01:20:37,465 --> 01:20:39,167
Look, is Jean-Marc's unhappy, he's free

1558
01:20:39,267 --> 01:20:40,936
to walk away from the deal.

1559
01:20:41,036 --> 01:20:41,970
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1560
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:43,672
Regan, quit being such a bully.

1561
01:20:43,772 --> 01:20:44,873
Come on.

1562
01:20:44,973 --> 01:20:46,441
I'd like to settle this so I can show

1563
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:50,045
Claire the pond where you tried to drown me when I was six.

1564
01:20:50,145 --> 01:20:51,713
You want to go two out of three?

1565
01:20:51,813 --> 01:20:53,648
[laughs]

1566
01:20:56,451 --> 01:20:58,320
Why don't we take a break and think about this.

1567
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:00,889
We've all got a lot of time and energy invested here.

1568
01:21:00,989 --> 01:21:02,490
That sounds like a great idea.

1569
01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:03,558
Come on, I'll show you the pond.

1570
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,342
[laughing]

1571
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:23,311
[car starts up]

1572
01:21:30,118 --> 01:21:34,222
Giving us another seat on the board is not unreasonable.

1573
01:21:34,322 --> 01:21:36,524
After all, we created the Napa Hills label.

1574
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:38,493
I went along with your price, but I'm not

1575
01:21:38,593 --> 01:21:39,694
going to let you hold me up.

1576
01:21:39,794 --> 01:21:40,629
Wait.

1577
01:21:44,532 --> 01:21:47,002
Regan, you've got to be reasonable.

1578
01:21:47,102 --> 01:21:49,304
No, I've got to protect my family.

1579
01:21:49,404 --> 01:21:51,273
Well, it's not like you have more buyers lined

1580
01:21:51,373 --> 01:21:53,508
up if Jean-Marc walks away.

1581
01:21:53,608 --> 01:21:54,442
I'll take my chances.

1582
01:21:57,879 --> 01:22:00,015
How's it going?

1583
01:22:00,115 --> 01:22:01,049
Where have you been?

1584
01:22:01,149 --> 01:22:02,384
Just out for a walk.

1585
01:22:02,484 --> 01:22:05,887
The air's so nice and soft this time of year.

1586
01:22:05,987 --> 01:22:08,523
Jean-Marc, will you excuse us for a minute?

1587
01:22:08,623 --> 01:22:09,758
Don't bother.

1588
01:22:09,858 --> 01:22:11,559
I'll talk to them.

1589
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:12,861
We can change the contract.

1590
01:22:12,961 --> 01:22:13,862
Wait.

1591
01:22:13,962 --> 01:22:17,132
Does it mean we have a deal?

1592
01:22:17,232 --> 01:22:18,166
Oh, well, great.

1593
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:19,501
Let's break out the champagne.

1594
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:22,237
Just one more thing.

1595
01:22:22,337 --> 01:22:23,571
I'm afraid I have to insist that we

1596
01:22:23,672 --> 01:22:26,441
retain the title to the house. - Here we go.

1597
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:27,642
Oh, god.

1598
01:22:27,742 --> 01:22:30,145
It's always been separate from the corporation.

1599
01:22:30,245 --> 01:22:32,213
No, it's always been part of the deal.

1600
01:22:32,314 --> 01:22:34,549
Of course, if we ever decide to sell,

1601
01:22:34,649 --> 01:22:38,119
outside the immediate family and the direct line, Jean-Marc

1602
01:22:38,219 --> 01:22:41,356
has the right of first refusal.

1603
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:43,425
If I say yes to this, what will you want next?

1604
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:47,529
Nothing.

1605
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:50,065
That's it.

1606
01:22:50,165 --> 01:22:51,199
My last demand.

1607
01:22:54,402 --> 01:22:55,236
Margo.

That's [inaudible].

1611
01:23:16,991 --> 01:23:18,893
Really?

1612

1614

May I come in?

1615
01:23:49,524 --> 01:23:50,125
Why?

1616
01:23:50,225 --> 01:23:51,393
What's the point?

1617

1620

REGAN: Denny!

1621
01:25:30,558 --> 01:25:32,660
Hey, Denny, come out here!

1622
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:49,777
DENNY: What is it, Regan?

1623
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:55,683
I need your car.

1624
01:25:55,783 --> 01:25:57,852
Yeah, sure.

1625
01:25:57,952 --> 01:25:58,887
What's the big deal?

1626
01:25:58,987 --> 01:25:59,787
I got to get to the airport.

1627
01:25:59,888 --> 01:26:01,122
I can't miss my flight.

1628
01:26:01,222 --> 01:26:02,390
DENNY: What?

1629
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:05,160
REGAN: I got a reservation back to London.

1630
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:06,361
Hey, hey, hey!

1631
01:26:06,461 --> 01:26:07,128
Hey!

1632
01:26:07,228 --> 01:26:08,696
You can't leave now.

1633

[engine turns over]

1634
01:26:09,797 --> 01:26:11,065
Regan!

[music playing]

1636
01:26:26,981 --> 01:26:28,016
Don't worry about Bernier.

1637
01:26:28,116 --> 01:26:29,083
He'll sign.

1638
01:26:29,183 --> 01:26:30,685
Look, who cares about the deal?

1639
01:26:30,785 --> 01:26:32,253
What about Claire?

1640
01:26:32,353 --> 01:26:33,187
What about her?

1641
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:34,856
Well, she loves you.

1642
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:35,823
[tires screech]

1643
01:26:35,924 --> 01:26:37,225
Oh, whoa!

1644
01:26:37,325 --> 01:26:38,192
Jeez, Regan.

1645
01:26:38,293 --> 01:26:39,761
Look, just, just slow down.

1646
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:41,162
Come on.

1647
01:26:41,262 --> 01:26:43,131
You're such a jerk.

1648
01:26:43,231 --> 01:26:45,300
[engine accelerates]

1649
01:26:47,168 --> 01:26:49,003
She's a good woman and she loves you.

1650
01:26:49,103 --> 01:26:51,172
Don't you lecture me about women, not after the way

1651
01:26:51,272 --> 01:26:52,473
you treat Margo.

1652
01:26:52,574 --> 01:26:54,842
Oh, you used Claire to set me up to squeeze

1653
01:26:54,943 --> 01:26:56,110
more money out of Bernier.

1654
01:26:56,210 --> 01:26:57,879
He was going to use our label as a front

1655
01:26:57,979 --> 01:26:58,980
for his second-rate wine.

1656
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:00,014
So?

1657
01:27:00,114 --> 01:27:01,382
What, that doesn't bother you?

1658
01:27:01,482 --> 01:27:02,517
No, why should it?

1659
01:27:02,617 --> 01:27:04,085
You weren't going to sell anyway.

1660
01:27:04,185 --> 01:27:05,119
What are you talking about?

1661
01:27:05,219 --> 01:27:07,121
I came back here to make a deal.

1662
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:08,656
We've got a deal with Bernier.

1663
01:27:08,756 --> 01:27:10,525
- I'll get you better offer. - No.

1664
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:12,594
No offer is ever going to be good enough for you.

1665
01:27:12,694 --> 01:27:15,530
So what are you now, an amateur psychologist?

1666
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:17,098
You block every deal that comes up

1667
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:18,199
because you don't want to sell.

1668
01:27:18,299 --> 01:27:19,367
You want to keep the place.

1669
01:27:19,467 --> 01:27:20,635
That's ridiculous.

1670
01:27:20,735 --> 01:27:22,103
Oh, you don't know how to stop running

1671
01:27:22,203 --> 01:27:23,738
away from what you love.

1672
01:27:23,838 --> 01:27:25,873
Look, could you just live your own damn life and I'll

1673
01:27:25,974 --> 01:27:27,041
live mine? - No.

1674
01:27:27,141 --> 01:27:28,610
The truth of it is, you love Claire

1675
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:30,778
and you're afraid to tell her.

1676
01:27:30,878 --> 01:27:32,347
[slams on the brakes]

1677
01:27:42,523 --> 01:27:44,258
I'm so sorry, Claire.

1678
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:46,361
No, I was a fool to think I could change him.

1679
01:27:46,461 --> 01:27:48,830
I guess that only happens in fairy tales.

1680
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:51,766
I, I just don't think he's realized it.

1681
01:27:51,866 --> 01:27:55,436
It's just a pity that being stupid isn't more painful.

1682
01:27:55,536 --> 01:27:56,738
You take care, OK?

1683
01:27:56,838 --> 01:27:57,672
Bye.

1684
01:27:57,772 --> 01:27:58,606
Bye.

1685
01:28:07,448 --> 01:28:08,916
[tires squeal]

1686
01:28:16,891 --> 01:28:17,792
Claire!

1687
01:28:17,892 --> 01:28:20,161
What the hell?

1688
01:28:20,261 --> 01:28:23,798
Can we go, please?

1689
01:28:23,898 --> 01:28:24,766
Claire, wait!

1690
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:30,038
Claire, please, stop!

1691
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:31,239
- Ah! - Claire!

1692
01:28:31,339 --> 01:28:32,774
- Just go! - Stop!

1693
01:28:32,874 --> 01:28:33,708
Go!

1694
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:34,876
But lady.

1695
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:36,244
Please.

1696
01:28:36,344 --> 01:28:37,812
I love you!

1697
01:28:40,648 --> 01:28:43,951
You see, lady, you don't want to go anywhere.

1698
01:28:48,489 --> 01:28:50,992
We ain't going nowhere now.

1699
01:28:51,092 --> 01:28:53,528
You're the most stubborn, conceited, egotistical,

1700
01:28:53,628 --> 01:28:55,229
overbearing, arrogant--

1701
01:28:55,329 --> 01:28:56,264
what are you doing?

1702
01:28:56,364 --> 01:28:57,398
Nothing.

1703
01:29:00,802 --> 01:29:02,170
I'm home.

1704
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:04,839
I'm wonderful.

1705
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:05,973
I'm in love.

1706
01:29:06,074 --> 01:29:06,874
How nice for you.

1707
01:29:06,974 --> 01:29:07,608
Start the car.

1708
01:29:07,709 --> 01:29:08,976
Look, Claire I mean it.

1709
01:29:09,077 --> 01:29:10,211
Claire, wait!

1710
01:29:10,311 --> 01:29:11,979
I'm home.

1711
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:13,247
Who cares?

1712
01:29:13,347 --> 01:29:14,315
I care.

1713
01:29:14,415 --> 01:29:15,383
I need you.

1714
01:29:15,483 --> 01:29:16,451
Without you, nothing matters.

1715
01:29:16,551 --> 01:29:18,152
We'll sell Bernier tomorrow.

1716
01:29:18,252 --> 01:29:19,187
Liar.

1717
01:29:19,287 --> 01:29:20,388
Denny, get the papers.

1718
01:29:20,488 --> 01:29:22,857
I'll sign them right now.

1719
01:29:22,957 --> 01:29:24,625
Say it again.

1720
01:29:24,726 --> 01:29:29,664
Claire, for the first time in my life, I know what I need.

1721
01:29:33,501 --> 01:29:36,370
I love you.

1722
01:29:36,471 --> 01:29:38,940
Will you marry me?

1723
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,341
[giggles]

1724
01:29:40,441 --> 01:29:42,510
[music playing]

1725
01:29:47,348 --> 01:29:48,416
I love you.

1726
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:59,260
You're one hell of a negotiator, you know.

1727
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,129
Why not?

1728
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:04,766
After all, it's only the most important deal of my life.

1729
01:30:04,866 --> 01:30:05,933
[laughs]

1730
