[Sighs]

184
00:18:22,431 --> 00:18:24,126
JAMIE: It wasn't my fault!

185
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,134
Why won't you ever be
on my side?

186
00:18:26,168 --> 00:18:27,795
EVE: I am always
on your side...

187
00:18:27,837 --> 00:18:30,135
but you have to give me
a chance.

188
00:18:30,172 --> 00:18:31,298
SEAN: Now what?

189
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,500
[Sighs]

190
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:35,704
She was suspended again.
Kid made fun of her clothes.

191
00:18:35,745 --> 00:18:36,871
She started a fight?

192
00:18:36,913 --> 00:18:39,279
JAMIE: Right, Dad,
don't even ask me what happened.

193
00:18:39,315 --> 00:18:41,681
SEAN: OK. What happened?

194
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:48,518
Oh. I see.

195
00:18:48,557 --> 00:18:51,117
JAMIE: Not like you would
believe me anyway.

196
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,924
Jamie, look, it's not easy, OK?

197
00:18:53,963 --> 00:18:56,124
I mean, look...

198
00:18:56,165 --> 00:18:58,429
you change the way you look
every week.

199
00:18:58,467 --> 00:19:00,002
And the way you act?

200
00:19:00,002 --> 00:19:01,867
Who are you supposed to be now?

201
00:19:02,939 --> 00:19:04,634
I'm supposed to be me.

202
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,074
Not like you have a clue
who I am anyway.

203
00:19:11,113 --> 00:19:12,307
[Door closes]

204
00:19:16,118 --> 00:19:18,279
EVE: I have to work tonight.

205
00:19:18,321 --> 00:19:20,346
I called to tell you.

206
00:19:20,389 --> 00:19:23,290
I was on hold for 10 minutes,
and I couldn't wait any longer.

207
00:19:23,326 --> 00:19:24,657
I got him, Eve.

208
00:19:28,731 --> 00:19:30,596
It's over?

209
00:19:31,934 --> 00:19:33,231
It's over.

210
00:19:35,972 --> 00:19:37,599
Oh, Sean.

211
00:19:41,377 --> 00:19:44,471
I'll make it up to
you and and Jamie, I promise.

212
00:19:44,513 --> 00:19:46,777
I'll put in for a desk job...

213
00:19:46,816 --> 00:19:50,217
and I'll do counseling,
sit down, talk about Mike.

214
00:19:50,252 --> 00:19:52,015
I'll do it. Anything you want.

215
00:19:52,054 --> 00:19:55,080
I just want you.

216
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:58,582
Well, good, 'cause
that's what you're gonna get.

217
00:19:58,627 --> 00:19:59,958
You happy?

218
00:19:59,996 --> 00:20:03,022
I think so. Yes.

219
00:20:03,065 --> 00:20:05,966
[Laughing]
Oh, thank God.

220
00:20:17,813 --> 00:20:19,747
MAN: Hold on.

221
00:20:31,627 --> 00:20:32,958
What is all this?

222
00:20:35,464 --> 00:20:38,092
KIMBERLY:
Sir, the ClA sent this over.

223
00:20:39,502 --> 00:20:42,630
SEAN: Didn't know they catered.
Send it back.

224
00:20:42,671 --> 00:20:43,831
No, wait.

225
00:20:46,342 --> 00:20:47,969
How about, uh...

226
00:20:49,345 --> 00:20:51,142
What about to Anderson...

227
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,410
Montgomery, Berkley...

228
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:58,510
Pincus...Gianelli...

229
00:20:59,522 --> 00:21:00,955
Winters.

[Sighs]

231
00:21:39,628 --> 00:21:40,788
How's Loomis?

232
00:21:42,665 --> 00:21:45,133
TITO: He's gonna need
a little surgery, but, uh...

233
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:46,657
he'll be OK.

234
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,296
What's up?

235
00:21:49,338 --> 00:21:51,898
Special Ops.
They want a word.

236
00:21:51,941 --> 00:21:54,705
Aw, forget it.
I don't have the time.

237
00:21:54,743 --> 00:21:56,734
HOLLIS: Better make time, Sean.

238
00:21:56,779 --> 00:21:58,804
Recovered from the jet wreckage.

239
00:21:58,848 --> 00:22:01,817
Found in Pollux Troy's
briefcase.

240
00:22:09,191 --> 00:22:12,354
[Music plays,
woman moans with pleasure]

241
00:22:13,362 --> 00:22:14,522
WOMAN: Ohh!

242
00:22:20,035 --> 00:22:22,333
SEAN: Porcelain casing.

243
00:22:22,371 --> 00:22:24,100
Thermal cloak.

244
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,904
Nerve gas
and biological payload.

245
00:22:26,942 --> 00:22:29,410
HOLLIS: It's enough to flatten
a square mile.

246
00:22:29,445 --> 00:22:32,278
Then, depending
on the prevailing winds...

247
00:22:32,314 --> 00:22:34,748
the fallout will be
a tad worse...

248
00:22:34,783 --> 00:22:36,614
than Gulf War Syndrome.

249
00:22:39,221 --> 00:22:42,190
SEAN:
The biblical plague to L.A.--

250
00:22:42,224 --> 00:22:44,624
Fuck! Aah! Where is he?

251
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,525
Where's Pollux Troy?

252
00:22:50,332 --> 00:22:54,132
MAN: Why draw the schematic if
you're not gonna build the bomb?

253
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:57,196
POLLUX: What, is it a crime
to exercise the mind?

254
00:22:57,239 --> 00:23:00,174
I won't say another word
until I see my brother.

255
00:23:02,978 --> 00:23:04,138
VICTOR: Any progress?

256
00:23:05,447 --> 00:23:07,711
I need about 10 minutes
alone with this guy.

257
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,877
You got Castor. Just go home.

258
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,216
[Sighs]

259
00:23:11,253 --> 00:23:13,312
We won't evacuate the city
on your hunch.

260
00:23:13,355 --> 00:23:16,449
Look, I know Castor too well
for this to be a hunch.

261
00:23:16,492 --> 00:23:17,686
You know what?

262
00:23:17,726 --> 00:23:20,854
Just run the goddamn bureau
any way you like.

263
00:23:25,801 --> 00:23:26,961
[Sighs]

264
00:23:30,606 --> 00:23:32,836
HOLLIS: I could put
an agent in his cell.

265
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,433
Maybe Pollux will let it slip.

266
00:23:34,476 --> 00:23:38,242
SEAN: Oh, come on.
He's a paranoid sociopath.

267
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,841
The only person he'd talk to
is his brother, and he's dead.

268
00:23:42,985 --> 00:23:45,180
HOLLIS:
There is one other possibility.

269
00:24:02,369 --> 00:24:04,360
[Beeping]

270
00:24:11,311 --> 00:24:15,304
Oh, God!
You're keeping him alive.

271
00:24:15,348 --> 00:24:18,181
HOLLIS: Relax, Archer.
He's a turnip.

272
00:24:19,352 --> 00:24:22,583
[Sean groaning]

273
00:24:22,622 --> 00:24:26,285
What if you could walk
into Erewhon prison...

274
00:24:26,326 --> 00:24:29,090
and give Pollux
a nice big brotherly hug...

275
00:24:29,129 --> 00:24:30,687
as Castor Troy?

276
00:24:31,965 --> 00:24:34,433
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

277
00:24:34,467 --> 00:24:38,028
MALCOLM: Let me try.
Malcolm Walsh.

278
00:24:38,071 --> 00:24:39,629
I run the bio cover unit
for Special Ops.

279
00:24:39,673 --> 00:24:42,198
-I know who you are.
-But not what I can do.

280
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:45,640
Physical alteration.
Augmentation.

281
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,943
HOLLIS: Dr. Walsh
can alter the likeness...

282
00:24:47,981 --> 00:24:50,279
even the voice
of a government witness.

283
00:24:50,317 --> 00:24:52,649
MALCOLM: I think you'll
recognize this patient.

284
00:24:56,289 --> 00:24:58,621
We had to build
your friend Loomis...

285
00:24:58,658 --> 00:25:00,319
a whole new ear from scratch.

286
00:25:09,436 --> 00:25:13,395
What we're suggesting for you
isn't a permanent transplant.

287
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,135
Just a temporary trade.

288
00:25:16,276 --> 00:25:17,436
Come here.

289
00:25:21,047 --> 00:25:24,505
With new anti-inflammatories,
healing takes days, not weeks.

290
00:25:24,551 --> 00:25:27,281
Your blood types won't match,
but Pollux won't know that.

291
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,151
Height difference is negligible.

292
00:25:32,392 --> 00:25:36,192
Skin pigment, eye pigment,
both almost identical.

293
00:25:37,697 --> 00:25:39,892
We'll use laser shears
for the hairline...

294
00:25:39,933 --> 00:25:41,400
microplugs for body hair.

295
00:25:42,435 --> 00:25:43,902
We'll do an abdominoplasty...

296
00:25:43,937 --> 00:25:46,030
take care of those, uh,
love handles.

297
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,267
But all that's the easy part.

298
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:50,833
Here's the real science.

299
00:25:51,845 --> 00:25:54,814
This is a state of the art
morphogenetic template.

300
00:25:54,848 --> 00:25:58,614
The inside is modeled
on your skull...

301
00:25:58,651 --> 00:26:02,553
The outside exactly like Troy's.
Then we fit his face on top.

302
00:26:02,589 --> 00:26:04,887
Not a replica,
but the real thing.

303
00:26:04,924 --> 00:26:06,391
Then we simply connect...

304
00:26:06,426 --> 00:26:08,053
the muscles, tear ducts,
and nerve endings...

305
00:26:08,094 --> 00:26:09,823
SEAN: So you want to take
his face and mine--

306
00:26:09,863 --> 00:26:10,989
HOLLIS: Borrow.

307
00:26:11,031 --> 00:26:13,056
The procedure's
completely reversible.

308
00:26:13,099 --> 00:26:16,227
SEAN: You think
that I want to do this?

309
00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:18,100
No. No!

310
00:26:18,138 --> 00:26:20,106
There's no one else, Sean.

311
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,131
You have lived and breathed
Castor Troy for years.

312
00:26:22,175 --> 00:26:24,735
I'll get his gang to talk.
That's what I do!

313
00:26:24,778 --> 00:26:27,269
What if you can't?
The bomb will blow.

314
00:26:27,313 --> 00:26:29,304
And Castor Troy will win.

315
00:26:32,285 --> 00:26:33,411
SEAN: Get out!

316
00:26:33,453 --> 00:26:35,921
Go ahead. Wipe your ass.

317
00:26:35,955 --> 00:26:38,515
TITO: Damn!
What the hell is that smell?

318
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:40,583
He shit in his pants.
Where's Dietrich?

319
00:26:41,961 --> 00:26:43,428
SEAN: Hello, Sasha.

320
00:26:44,931 --> 00:26:46,899
When was the last time
you saw Castor Troy?

321
00:26:46,933 --> 00:26:49,663
-Who cares? He's dead.
-Answer the question.

322
00:26:49,702 --> 00:26:52,432
I know my rights.
I don't have to answer shit.

323
00:26:52,472 --> 00:26:53,803
You're right, but know this.

324
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,307
You're a convicted felon...

325
00:26:55,341 --> 00:26:57,809
on probation
for harboring Castor Troy.

326
00:26:57,844 --> 00:26:59,539
One phone call from me...

327
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:01,740
and your son will end up
in a foster home.

328
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,377
I understand why you would use
such a threat...

329
00:27:09,422 --> 00:27:11,390
but you try to take him
away from me...

330
00:27:11,424 --> 00:27:12,891
I swear to you...

331
00:27:18,131 --> 00:27:19,723
I haven't seen him for years.

332
00:27:24,471 --> 00:27:25,631
[Sighs]

333
00:27:35,448 --> 00:27:36,915
SEAN: This reeks of you.

334
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,009
It's got your signature
all over it.

335
00:27:41,554 --> 00:27:44,318
DIETRICH: Maybe, but you
ain't got nothin' on me...

336
00:27:44,357 --> 00:27:45,824
and you know it.

337
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:49,818
Maybe so, but I can keep you
within city limits...

338
00:27:49,863 --> 00:27:51,353
or I can talk
to your sister again.

339
00:27:51,397 --> 00:27:53,558
She's right outside.

340
00:27:55,368 --> 00:27:57,996
Only this time I'll be nice.

341
00:27:59,038 --> 00:27:59,970
Hey, Sean...

342
00:28:01,741 --> 00:28:02,901
how's your dead son?

343
00:28:07,614 --> 00:28:09,582
Aah!

344
00:28:12,252 --> 00:28:13,617
I don't know any--

345
00:28:13,653 --> 00:28:17,487
OK. Something about the 18th,
but that's all I know.

346
00:28:25,932 --> 00:28:30,301
TITO: Great. So we got a date.
Where the hell's the damn bomb?

347
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,133
Only Pollux Troy'll know that.

348
00:28:32,172 --> 00:28:33,969
It's your call, Sean.

349
00:28:34,007 --> 00:28:36,771
SEAN:
Does Lazarro know your plan?

350
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:39,107
HOLLIS: No.
This is a black bag operation.

351
00:28:39,145 --> 00:28:41,079
Strictly off the books.

352
00:28:41,114 --> 00:28:44,379
You can't tell Lazarro,
and you can't tell your wife.

353
00:28:46,953 --> 00:28:49,114
Oh, God.

354
00:28:49,155 --> 00:28:51,123
What are you asking me to do?

355
00:28:51,157 --> 00:28:52,624
OK, let's see.

356
00:28:52,659 --> 00:28:56,720
You're asking me
to break the law...

357

POLLUX: No. Although now I am
the only one with the looks.

718
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:01,930
Touché.

COP: Go! Go! Move this way!

725
01:01:29,035 --> 01:01:31,469
-Any ideas?
-Yeah. Run.

726
01:01:33,006 --> 01:01:35,600
COP: Sir, it's protected
by a tamper switch.

727
01:01:35,642 --> 01:01:37,371
It'll take us hours to bypass.

728
01:01:39,846 --> 01:01:41,575
CASTOR: Evacuate your team.

729
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:43,582
No, but, sir, we can't disarm--

730
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:44,776
Leave!

Oh, baby!

738
01:02:22,487 --> 01:02:23,647
Ohh!

739
01:02:26,991 --> 01:02:29,653
REPORTER: That was the scene
at the L.A. Convention Center...

740
01:02:29,694 --> 01:02:32,185
where an FBI agent
became a city savior.

741
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:35,825
Sean Archer disarmed
a massive bomb...

742
01:02:35,867 --> 01:02:38,199
just one second before
it was set to blow.

743
01:02:38,236 --> 01:02:41,694
The apparent targets were
three Supreme Court justices...

744
01:02:41,739 --> 01:02:43,536
scheduled to speak here today...

745
01:02:43,574 --> 01:02:46,566
and anyone unlucky enough to be
within a mile of the scene.

746
01:02:46,611 --> 01:02:49,603
We asked Agent Archer
if the FBI had any leads...

747
01:02:49,647 --> 01:02:51,444
on who planted the device.

748
01:02:51,482 --> 01:02:54,508
CASTOR: Well, that is
classified information.

749
01:02:54,552 --> 01:02:56,179
But, if he's listening...

750
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:58,279
I wouldn't mind
giving him a message.

751
01:02:58,322 --> 01:02:59,846
Interception!

752
01:02:59,891 --> 01:03:01,859
Now our side's got the ball!
Sorry.

CASTOR: Wanda? Everybody!

756
01:03:47,738 --> 01:03:49,569
Hey, look, l...

757
01:03:49,607 --> 01:03:51,837
I want to thank you...

758
01:03:51,876 --> 01:03:53,241
for, uh...

759
01:03:53,277 --> 01:03:57,475
enduring all these years
I was an insufferable bore.

760
01:03:57,515 --> 01:03:58,846
[Laughter]

761
01:03:58,883 --> 01:04:00,077
WANDA: Sir?

762
01:04:00,117 --> 01:04:02,051
Did you just have
a surgical procedure?

763
01:04:03,321 --> 01:04:04,447
What do you mean?

764
01:04:04,488 --> 01:04:07,480
Well, was the stick successfully
removed from your ass?

765
01:04:07,525 --> 01:04:08,685
[Laughter]

766
01:04:12,196 --> 01:04:15,165
KIMBERLY: Sir,
the White House on one.

767
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:17,895
It's the President.
Oh, and your wife on line two.

768
01:04:17,935 --> 01:04:20,495
Will you tell
the President to hold?

769
01:04:20,538 --> 01:04:22,335
[Gasps]

770
01:04:22,373 --> 01:04:24,000
Oh!

[Gasps]

772
01:04:51,769 --> 01:04:53,168
Oh, my God!

773
01:04:53,204 --> 01:04:54,694
Sean, you scared
the hell out of me.

774
01:04:54,739 --> 01:04:55,899
CASTOR: It's date night.

775
01:04:59,043 --> 01:05:00,169
Congratulations.

776
01:05:00,211 --> 01:05:02,509
Oh, big deal.

777
01:05:05,149 --> 01:05:06,275
OK, I said, uh...

778
01:05:06,317 --> 01:05:07,750
"Mr. President...

779
01:05:07,785 --> 01:05:11,118
"l want the authority...

780
01:05:11,155 --> 01:05:13,589
"and I want the funds
and the personnel...

781
01:05:13,624 --> 01:05:16,388
"to take over the whole gamut
of global terrorism."

782
01:05:16,427 --> 01:05:17,587
Right?

783
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:20,763
And he said...

784
01:05:20,798 --> 01:05:24,791
"The next name on
my calling list is Lazarro."

785
01:05:24,835 --> 01:05:27,929
And I'm telling him Sean Archer
writes his own ticket.

786
01:05:27,972 --> 01:05:29,234
OK?

787
01:05:30,408 --> 01:05:32,376
[Sighs]

788
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:34,435
What's the matter?

789
01:05:34,478 --> 01:05:37,140
I don't know, Sean.

790
01:05:37,181 --> 01:05:39,342
You just seem so different.

791
01:05:39,383 --> 01:05:40,941
Hmm?

792
01:05:40,985 --> 01:05:42,714
EVE: What is all this about?

793
01:05:42,753 --> 01:05:45,221
This intimate
candlelight dinner?

794
01:05:45,256 --> 01:05:47,019
Huh?

795
01:05:47,058 --> 01:05:49,185
I'm supposed to forget
all the promises...

796
01:05:49,226 --> 01:05:50,750
'cause you're going back
into the fray?

797
01:05:52,863 --> 01:05:55,297
[Sighs]

798
01:06:10,548 --> 01:06:14,143
If the top cop
in this country...

799
01:06:14,185 --> 01:06:16,449
can't come home every night
to his wife...

800
01:06:16,487 --> 01:06:19,547
then the hell
with the country...

801
01:06:19,590 --> 01:06:21,956
because the only place
I'm going...

802
01:06:23,327 --> 01:06:25,056
is upstairs with you.

803
01:06:40,878 --> 01:06:43,176

SEAN: How can l
get out of here?

806
01:06:56,460 --> 01:06:57,722
HICKS: You can't.

807
01:06:59,797 --> 01:07:01,560
How can I get these boots off?

808
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:03,726
They only take them off
in the clinic...

809
01:07:03,768 --> 01:07:06,566
right before
they fry your skull.

810
01:07:16,981 --> 01:07:18,141
Hey!

811
01:07:21,419 --> 01:07:23,216
I'm out of cigarettes.

812

GUARD: Get back in line, Troy.

813
01:07:27,258 --> 01:07:28,953
I said I'm out of cigarettes.

814
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,497
Ugh.

That's not right!

Aah!

-Anybody got a light?
-All right!

Anybody got a light?

822
01:08:05,629 --> 01:08:07,028
Anybody got a light?
