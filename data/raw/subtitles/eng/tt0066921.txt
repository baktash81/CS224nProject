1
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,320
There was me.

2
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,485
That is, Alex,
and my three droogs.

3
00:01:57,741 --> 00:02:01,405
That is, Pete, Georgie and Dim.

4
00:02:01,786 --> 00:02:05,367
And we sat in the Korova Milk Bar,
trying to make up our rassoodocks...

5
00:02:05,622 --> 00:02:07,863
... what to do with the evening.

6
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:12,666
The Korova Milk Bar sold milk plus.

7
00:02:12,918 --> 00:02:16,535
Milk plus vellocet or
synthemesc or drencrom...

8
00:02:16,796 --> 00:02:18,788
... which is what we were drinking.

9
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,714
This would sharpen you up...

10
00:02:20,965 --> 00:02:24,878
...and make you ready for a bit
of the old ultra-violence.

11
00:02:29,262 --> 00:02:32,761
In Dublin 's fair city

12
00:02:33,432 --> 00:02:37,559
Where the girls are so pretty

13
00:02:38,644 --> 00:02:41,679
I first set my eyes

14
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:46,353
On sweet Molly Malone

15
00:02:47,483 --> 00:02:52,143
As she wheeled her wheelbarrow

16
00:02:52,403 --> 00:02:56,779
Through streets broad and narrow

17
00:02:57,031 --> 00:03:01,490
Crying, ''Cockles and mussels.... ''

18
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,485
One thing I could never stand...

19
00:03:04,744 --> 00:03:07,151
... was to see a filthy,
dirty old drunkie...

20
00:03:07,413 --> 00:03:10,081
...howling away at the
filthy songs of his fathers...

21
00:03:10,332 --> 00:03:12,656
...and going ''blerp blerp''
in between...

22
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:17,162
...as it might be a filthy old
orchestra in his stinking guts.

23
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,001
I could never stand to see anyone
like that, whatever his age.

24
00:03:21,255 --> 00:03:24,421
But more especially when he
was real old, like this one was.

25
00:03:32,054 --> 00:03:36,098
Can you spare some cutter,
me brothers?

26
00:03:39,267 --> 00:03:44,343
Go on! Do me in, you bastard cowards!
I don't want to Iive anyway.

27
00:03:44,604 --> 00:03:47,439
Not in a stinking worId
Iike this.

28
00:03:50,191 --> 00:03:53,357
And what's so stinking about it?

29
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,856
It's a stinking worId because
there's no Iaw and order anymore!

30
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:01,197
It stinks because it Iets
the young get onto the oId. . .

31
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,488
. . .Iike you done!

32
00:04:03,742 --> 00:04:08,568
It's no worId
for an oId man any Ionger.

33
00:04:09,162 --> 00:04:12,577
What kind of a worId is it
at aII?

34
00:04:12,832 --> 00:04:14,705
Men on the moon.

35
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,448
Men spinning around the earth.

36
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,745
And there's not no
attention paid. . .

37
00:04:20,962 --> 00:04:24,496
. . .to earthIy
Iaw and order no more.

38
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:27,454
Oh, dear land

39
00:04:27,842 --> 00:04:30,166
I fought for thee

40
00:05:05,408 --> 00:05:09,191
It was at the derelict casino
that we came across Billy-boy...

41
00:05:09,453 --> 00:05:11,491
...and his four droogs.

42
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:14,236
They were about to perform
a little of the old...

43
00:05:14,498 --> 00:05:18,446
...in-out, in-out on a weepy
young devotchka they had there.

44
00:06:08,575 --> 00:06:11,445
WeII, if it isn't fat, stinking. . .

45
00:06:11,702 --> 00:06:15,995
. . .biIIy goat
BiIIy-boy in poison.

46
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,455
How are thou. . .

47
00:06:18,707 --> 00:06:22,490
. . .thou gIobby bottIe of cheap,
stinking chip-oiI?

48
00:06:24,253 --> 00:06:26,825
Come and get one in the yarbIes. . .

49
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:28,961
. . .if you have any yarbIes. . .

50
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:32,214
. . .you eunuch jeIIy, thou.

51
00:06:35,677 --> 00:06:37,336
Let's get them, boys!

52
00:07:35,383 --> 00:07:36,794
The poIice!

53
00:07:37,385 --> 00:07:39,044
Come on. Let's go!

54
00:07:59,983 --> 00:08:04,525
The Durango 95 purred away
real horrorshow.

55
00:08:04,778 --> 00:08:09,023
A nice, warm vibratey feeling
all through your guttiwuts.

56
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:12,447
Soon it was trees and dark,
my brothers...

57
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,237
... with real country dark.

58
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:55,267
We fillied around with other
travelers of the night...

59
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,845
...playing Hogs of the Road.

60
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:00,097
Then we headed west.

61
00:09:00,357 --> 00:09:04,021
What we were after now
was the old surprise visit.

62
00:09:04,276 --> 00:09:05,521
That was a real kick...

63
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:10,236
...and good for laughs and
lashing of the old ultra-violent.

64
00:09:58,646 --> 00:10:00,638
Who on earth couId that be?

65
00:10:09,736 --> 00:10:11,313
I'II go and see.

66
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:23,737
Yes, who is it?

67
00:10:23,954 --> 00:10:27,997
Excuse me, can you pIease heIp?
There's been a terribIe accident!

68
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:33,328
My friend's bIeeding to death!
Can I pIease use your teIephone?

69
00:10:33,586 --> 00:10:36,835
We don't have a teIephone.
You'II have to go somewhere eIse.

70
00:10:37,088 --> 00:10:39,792
But, missus, it's a matter
of Iife and death!

71
00:10:40,048 --> 00:10:41,328
Who is it, dear?

72
00:10:41,591 --> 00:10:44,128
A young man.
He says there's been an accident.

73
00:10:44,384 --> 00:10:47,053
He wants to use the teIephone.

74
00:10:48,054 --> 00:10:50,544
I suppose you better Iet him in.

75
00:10:51,556 --> 00:10:53,382
Wait a minute, wiII you?

76
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:58,843
I'm sorry, but we don't usuaIIy
Iet strangers in--

77
00:11:10,944 --> 00:11:12,817
What do you want from me?

78
00:11:16,573 --> 00:11:19,323
Pete, check the rest
of the house. Dim. . . .

79
00:11:24,203 --> 00:11:26,444
I'm singing in the rain

80
00:11:27,496 --> 00:11:29,405
Just singing in the rain

81
00:11:30,248 --> 00:11:32,039
What a glorious feeling

82
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,452
I'm happy again

83
00:11:35,835 --> 00:11:37,662
I'm laughing at clouds

84
00:11:38,796 --> 00:11:40,171
So dark up above

85
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:43,166
The sun 's in my heart

86
00:11:44,591 --> 00:11:46,417
And I'm ready for love

87
00:11:48,052 --> 00:11:50,293
Let the stormy clouds chase

88
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:53,088
Everyone from the place

89
00:11:55,473 --> 00:11:56,754
Come on with the rain

90
00:11:57,725 --> 00:11:59,847
I've a smile on my face

91
00:12:00,852 --> 00:12:02,891
I'll walk down the lane

92
00:12:03,896 --> 00:12:05,852
With a happy refrain

93
00:12:06,939 --> 00:12:08,813
And I'm singing

94
00:12:09,441 --> 00:12:10,899
Just singing...

95
00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:14,231
...in the rain

96
00:13:20,989 --> 00:13:22,447
Viddy weII, IittIe brother.

97
00:13:22,698 --> 00:13:24,358
Viddy weII.

98
00:13:44,713 --> 00:13:48,544
We were all feeling a bit
shagged and fagged and fashed...

99
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,376
...it having been an evening
of some small energy expenditure.

100
00:13:53,636 --> 00:13:58,592
So we got rid of the auto and
stopped at the Korova for a nightcap.

101
00:14:04,935 --> 00:14:06,393
HeIIo, Lucy.

102
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,227
Had a busy night?

103
00:14:10,939 --> 00:14:13,310
We've been working hard too.

104
00:14:15,692 --> 00:14:17,518
Pardon me, Luce.

105
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:28,738
There was some sophistos from
the TV studios around the corner...

106
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,198
...laughing and govoreeting.

107
00:14:31,536 --> 00:14:36,659
The devotchka smeched away, not
caring about the wicked world one bit.

108
00:14:37,457 --> 00:14:40,824
Then the disk on the stereo
twanged off and out.

109
00:14:41,084 --> 00:14:44,368
And in the short silence
before the next one came on...

110
00:14:44,628 --> 00:14:47,794
...she suddenly came
with a burst of singing.

111
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:53,957
And it was like, for a moment,
O my brothers...

112
00:14:54,218 --> 00:14:57,467
...some great bird
had flown into the milk bar.

113
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,969
And I felt all the malenky
little hairs on my plott...

114
00:15:01,222 --> 00:15:03,096
...standing endwise.

115
00:15:03,474 --> 00:15:07,553
And the shivers crawling up
like slow, malenky lizards...

116
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,434
...and then down again.

117
00:15:09,686 --> 00:15:12,390
Because I knew what she sang.

118
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:16,061
It was a bit from
the glorious Ninth, by Ludwig van.

119
00:15:24,863 --> 00:15:26,985
What did you do that for?

120
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,279
For being a bastard
with no manners.

121
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:34,359
Without a dook of an idea about how
to comport yourseIf pubIic-wise.

122
00:15:36,663 --> 00:15:39,449
I don't Iike you shouId
do what you done.

123
00:15:39,915 --> 00:15:43,330
And I'm not your brother no more
and wouIdn't want to be.

124
00:15:46,794 --> 00:15:48,122
Watch that.

125
00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:54,253
Do watch that, if to continue
to be on Iive thou dost wish.

126
00:15:56,217 --> 00:15:57,462
YarbIes!

127
00:15:57,718 --> 00:16:00,469
Great, bouncy yarbIockos to you!

128
00:16:00,887 --> 00:16:04,587
I'II meet you with chain
or nozh or britva anytime.

129
00:16:04,848 --> 00:16:07,517
I'm not having you aiming
toIchocks at me reasonIess.

130
00:16:07,975 --> 00:16:10,845
It stands to reason,
I won't have it.

131
00:16:15,564 --> 00:16:18,978
A nozh scrap anytime you say.

132
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:35,575
Doobidoob.

133
00:16:37,828 --> 00:16:39,785
A bit tired maybe.

134
00:16:41,873 --> 00:16:43,699
Best not to say more.

135
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,538
Bedways is rightways now.

136
00:16:48,085 --> 00:16:51,204
So best we go homeways
and get a bit of spatchka.

137
00:16:51,504 --> 00:16:52,915
Right, right?

138
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,884
Where I lived was with
my dada and mum...

139
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,552
...in municipal flat block
1 8-A, Linear North.

140
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,282
It had been a wonderful evening.

141
00:18:40,535 --> 00:18:44,069
And what I needed now
to give it the perfect ending...

142
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,283
... was a bit
of the old Ludwig van.

143
00:19:37,365 --> 00:19:38,693
Oh, bliss!

144
00:19:39,283 --> 00:19:41,358
Bliss and heaven!

145
00:19:41,868 --> 00:19:46,445
It was gorgeousness and
gorgeosity made flesh.

146
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:51,290
It was like a bird
of rarest spun heaven metal.

147
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,991
Or like silvery wine
flowing in a spaceship...

148
00:19:55,252 --> 00:19:58,038
...gravity all nonsense now.

149
00:19:58,546 --> 00:20:00,004
As I slooshied...

150
00:20:00,255 --> 00:20:03,291
...I knew such lovely pictures.

151
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,264
AIex. AIex!

152
00:20:31,484 --> 00:20:32,943
What do you want?

153
00:20:33,194 --> 00:20:34,735
It's past eight, AIex.

154
00:20:34,987 --> 00:20:38,070
You don't want to be
Iate for schooI, son.

155
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:42,152
Bit of a pain in the guIIiver, Mum.

156
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,945
Leave us be,
and I'II try and sIeep it off.

157
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,953
And then I'II be as right
as dodgers for this after.

158
00:20:48,913 --> 00:20:51,996
But you've not been
to schooI aII week, son.

159
00:20:52,248 --> 00:20:53,410
Got to rest, Mum.

160
00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:55,742
Got to get fit.

161
00:20:56,209 --> 00:20:59,707
Otherwise, I'm IiabIe
to miss a Iot more schooI.

162
00:20:59,962 --> 00:21:05,037
I'II put your breakfast in the oven.
I've got to be off meseIf now.

163
00:21:06,174 --> 00:21:10,336
AII right, Mum.
Have a nice day at the factory.

164
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,799
He's not feeIing too good
again this morning, Dad.

165
00:21:18,057 --> 00:21:19,883
Yes. Yes, I heard.

166
00:21:20,392 --> 00:21:21,850
You know what time he got in?

167
00:21:22,143 --> 00:21:25,096
No, I don't.
I'd taken me sIeepers.

168
00:21:27,772 --> 00:21:29,266
I wonder. . .

169
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:33,733
. . .where exactIy is it
he goes to work of evenings.

170
00:21:35,902 --> 00:21:37,313
Like he says. . .

171
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,895
. . .it's mostIy odd things he does.

172
00:21:40,155 --> 00:21:41,317
HeIping-Iike. . .

173
00:21:41,573 --> 00:21:44,241
. . .here and there, as it might be.

174
00:22:25,852 --> 00:22:27,844
Hi, hi, hi, Mr. DeItoid.

175
00:22:28,104 --> 00:22:30,012
Funny surprise, seeing you here.

176
00:22:30,272 --> 00:22:34,185
AIex-boy!
Awake at Iast, yes?

177
00:22:34,817 --> 00:22:37,817
I met your mother
on the way to work, yes?

178
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:40,108
She gave me the key.

179
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:45,111
She said something about
a pain somewhere.

180
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:48,318
Hence, not at schooI, yes?

181
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,825
A rather intoIerabIe pain
in the head, brother sir.

182
00:22:52,078 --> 00:22:54,200
It shouId be cIear
by this afterIunch.

183
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,653
Or certainIy by this evening, yes.

184
00:22:57,915 --> 00:23:01,118
The evening's the great time,
isn't it, AIex-boy?

185
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:04,910
-Cup of the oId chai, sir?
-No time, no time.

186
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,747
Sit, sit, sit!

187
00:23:08,339 --> 00:23:11,090
To what do I owe
this extreme pIeasure, sir?

188
00:23:11,841 --> 00:23:13,004
Anything wrong, sir?

189
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:17,090
Wrong? Why shouId you
think of anything being wrong?

190
00:23:17,345 --> 00:23:19,716
Have you been doing
something you shouIdn't?

191
00:23:19,972 --> 00:23:21,252
Just a manner of speech.

192
00:23:21,514 --> 00:23:24,550
Yes, weII, it's just a manner
of speech from your. . .

193
00:23:24,808 --> 00:23:28,057
. . .post-corrective advisor to you
that you watch out, IittIe AIex.

194
00:23:28,311 --> 00:23:31,844
Because next time it's not
going to be the corrective schooI.

195
00:23:32,105 --> 00:23:36,397
Next time it'II be the BarIey pIace,
and aII my work ruined.

196
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,440
If you've no respect
for yourseIf. . .

197
00:23:38,693 --> 00:23:41,776
. . .you at Ieast might have some
for me, who sweated over you.

198
00:23:42,028 --> 00:23:46,107
A big, bIack mark, I teII you,
for every one we don't recIaim.

199
00:23:46,364 --> 00:23:49,566
A confession of faiIure
for every one of you. . .

200
00:23:49,825 --> 00:23:52,742
. . .who ends up in the stripy hoIe.

201
00:23:52,994 --> 00:23:54,820
I've been doing nothing I shouIdn't.

202
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:57,699
The miIIicents have nothing
on me, brother.

203
00:23:57,955 --> 00:23:59,235
Sir, I mean.

204
00:23:59,498 --> 00:24:02,035
Cut out this cIever taIk
about miIIicents.

205
00:24:02,292 --> 00:24:04,497
Just because the poIice
haven't picked you up. . .

206
00:24:04,752 --> 00:24:07,954
. . .doesn't mean that you've not
been up to some nastiness.

207
00:24:08,212 --> 00:24:13,335
There was a bit of nastiness Iast night.
Some very extreme nastiness, yes?

208
00:24:13,591 --> 00:24:17,753
A few of a certain BiIIy-boy's
friends were ambuIanced off Iate.

209
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,421
Your name was mentioned.

210
00:24:19,678 --> 00:24:21,884
The words got to me
by the usuaI channeIs.

211
00:24:22,138 --> 00:24:24,972
Certain friends of yours
were named aIso.

212
00:24:25,224 --> 00:24:28,426
Nobody can prove anything
about anybody, as usuaI.

213
00:24:28,684 --> 00:24:30,261
I'm warning you, IittIe AIex. . .

214
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:32,760
. . .being a good friend
to you as aIways. . .

215
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,771
. . .the one man in this
sore and sick community. . .

216
00:24:36,022 --> 00:24:38,726
. . .who wants to save you
from yourseIf!

217
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,828
What gets into you aII?

218
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,365
We've been studying the probIem
for damn weII near a century.

219
00:25:03,624 --> 00:25:05,746
But we get no farther
with our studies.

220
00:25:06,001 --> 00:25:08,491
You got a good home here.
Good, Ioving parents.

221
00:25:08,753 --> 00:25:10,875
You've got not too bad of a brain.

222
00:25:11,129 --> 00:25:14,295
Is it some deviI
that crawIs inside of you?

223
00:25:14,548 --> 00:25:16,421
Nobody's got anything on me.

224
00:25:16,675 --> 00:25:19,425
I been out of the miIIicents'
rookers for a Iong time.

225
00:25:19,677 --> 00:25:24,171
That's just what worries me.
A bit too Iong to be safe.

226
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,256
You're about due, by my reckoning.

227
00:25:26,514 --> 00:25:27,795
That's why I'm warning you. . .

228
00:25:28,057 --> 00:25:31,555
. . .to keep your handsome
young proboscis out of the dirt.

229
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,138
Do I make myseIf cIear?

230
00:25:33,394 --> 00:25:34,804
As an unmuddied Iake, sir.

231
00:25:35,062 --> 00:25:38,430
As cIear as an azure sky
of deepest summer.

232
00:25:38,689 --> 00:25:40,977
You can reIy on me, sir.

233
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,687
Excuse me, brother.

234
00:26:48,944 --> 00:26:52,561
I ordered this two weeks ago.
Can you see if it's arrived?

235
00:26:53,948 --> 00:26:55,228
Just a minute.

236
00:27:21,508 --> 00:27:23,167
Pardon me, Iadies.

237
00:27:31,765 --> 00:27:34,385
Enjoying that, are you, my darIing?

238
00:27:36,977 --> 00:27:40,309
A bit coId and pointIess,
isn't it, my IoveIy?

239
00:27:44,648 --> 00:27:47,565
What's happened to yours,
my IittIe sister?

240
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:51,193
Who you getting, bratty?

241
00:27:51,445 --> 00:27:53,567
GoggIy GogoI?
Johnny Zhivago?

242
00:27:53,821 --> 00:27:55,694
The Heaven 1 7?

243
00:27:59,992 --> 00:28:03,823
What you got back home
to pIay your fuzzy warbIes on?

244
00:28:04,078 --> 00:28:08,323
I bet you've got IittIe
pitifuI, portabIe picnic pIayers.

245
00:28:08,581 --> 00:28:10,739
Come with UncIe
and hear aII proper.

246
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:14,035
Hear angeI trumpets
and deviI trombones.

247
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:16,332
You are invited.

248
00:29:38,683 --> 00:29:39,631
Hi, hi, hi, there.

249
00:29:39,892 --> 00:29:40,887
WeII, heIIo.

250
00:29:41,143 --> 00:29:43,763
He are here!
He have arrived!

251
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,597
Hooray!

252
00:29:46,271 --> 00:29:49,057
WeIIy, weIIy, weIIy,
weIIy, weIIy, weIIy, weII!

253
00:29:50,732 --> 00:29:55,476
To what do I owe the extreme pIeasure
of this surprising visit?

254
00:30:00,822 --> 00:30:02,530
We got worried.

255
00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:10,283
There we were, waiting and drinking
away at the oId knifey moIoko. . .

256
00:30:10,996 --> 00:30:13,071
. . .and you had not turned up.

257
00:30:13,498 --> 00:30:15,703
And we thought
you might have been, Iike. . .

258
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:18,282
. . .offended by something
or other.

259
00:30:18,543 --> 00:30:20,914
So around we come to your abode.

260
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,545
Appy poIIy Ioggies.

261
00:30:28,841 --> 00:30:31,960
I had something of a pain
in the guIIiver, so I had to sIeep.

262
00:30:32,218 --> 00:30:35,053
I was not awakened
when I gave orders for wakening.

263
00:30:35,304 --> 00:30:37,711
Sorry about the pain.

264
00:30:38,431 --> 00:30:40,921
Using the guIIiver
too much-Iike, maybe.

265
00:30:44,143 --> 00:30:47,593
Giving orders and
discipIine and such, perhaps.

266
00:30:48,062 --> 00:30:50,387
You sure the pain is gone?

267
00:30:50,856 --> 00:30:53,939
You sure you'd not
be happier back in bed?

268
00:31:15,414 --> 00:31:19,706
Let's get things nice
and sparkIing cIear.

269
00:31:23,086 --> 00:31:25,540
This sarcasm,
if I may caII it such. . .

270
00:31:25,796 --> 00:31:28,547
. . .does not become you,
my IittIe brothers.

271
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:33,501
As I am your droog and Ieader
I'm entitIed to know what goes on.

272
00:31:35,386 --> 00:31:36,583
Now then, Dim.

273
00:31:36,845 --> 00:31:41,007
What does that great big
horsey gape of a grin portend?

274
00:31:43,016 --> 00:31:46,763
AII right, no more
picking on Dim, brother.

275
00:31:47,018 --> 00:31:49,425
That's part of the new way.

276
00:31:57,233 --> 00:32:01,146
New way?
What's this about a new way?

277
00:32:02,445 --> 00:32:07,355
There's been some very Iarge taIk
behind my sIeeping back, I know it.

278
00:32:08,741 --> 00:32:11,658
If you must have it,
have it, then.

279
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:15,079
We go around shop crasting
and the Iike. . .

280
00:32:15,329 --> 00:32:18,910
. . .coming out with a pitifuI
rookerfuII of money each.

281
00:32:19,248 --> 00:32:21,489
And WiII the EngIish
in the coffee mesto. . .

282
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:25,367
. . .saying he can fence anything
any maIchick tries to crast.

283
00:32:25,627 --> 00:32:27,536
The shiny stuff. The ice!

284
00:32:27,796 --> 00:32:31,839
The big, big money's avaiIabIe,
is what WiII the EngIish says.

285
00:32:33,883 --> 00:32:37,167
And what wiII you do
with the big, big, big money?

286
00:32:37,427 --> 00:32:39,336
Have you not everything you need?

287
00:32:39,595 --> 00:32:42,512
If you need a motorcar,
you pIuck it from the trees.

288
00:32:42,764 --> 00:32:45,799
If you need pretty poIIy,
you take it.

289
00:32:46,058 --> 00:32:50,635
Brother, you think and taIk
sometimes Iike a IittIe chiId.

290
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,057
Tonight we puII a man-size crast.

291
00:32:55,981 --> 00:32:58,305
Good! ReaI horrorshow!

292
00:32:58,566 --> 00:33:00,937
Initiative comes
to thems that wait.

293
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:04,610
I've taught you much,
my IittIe droogies.

294
00:33:06,029 --> 00:33:09,397
Now teII me what you had in mind,
Georgie-boy.

295
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:15,944
The oId moIoko pIus first.
WouId you not say?

296
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:19,986
-Something to sharpen us up.
-Some moIoko pIus.

297
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:26,330
You got to go there first.
We got a start on you. MoIoko PIus!

298
00:33:34,257 --> 00:33:36,711
As we walked along
the flatblock marina...

299
00:33:36,967 --> 00:33:41,212
...I was calm on the outside,
but thinking all the time.

300
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:44,007
So now it was to be
Georgie the General...

301
00:33:44,263 --> 00:33:46,718
...saying what we should do
and what not to do.

302
00:33:46,973 --> 00:33:50,886
And Dim as his mindless,
grinning bulldog.

303
00:33:51,143 --> 00:33:54,807
But suddenly I viddied that
thinking was for the gloopy ones...

304
00:33:55,062 --> 00:34:00,185
...and that the oomny ones used, like,
inspiration and what Bog sends.

305
00:34:00,691 --> 00:34:04,521
For now it was lovely music
that came to my aid.

306
00:34:04,777 --> 00:34:07,860
There was a window open
with a stereo on...

307
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:11,397
...and I viddied right at once
what to do.

308
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:20,490
I had not cut into any
of Dim's main cables.

309
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,985
And so with the help
of a clean tashtook...

310
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,617
... the red, red kroovy
soon stopped.

311
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:29,537
And it did not take long to
quieten the two wounded soldiers...

312
00:35:29,792 --> 00:35:32,460
...down in the snug
of the Duke of New York.

313
00:35:33,378 --> 00:35:36,911
Now they knew who was
master and leader.

314
00:35:37,422 --> 00:35:39,331
Sheep, thought I.

315
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,748
But a real leader knows
always when, like...

316
00:35:42,008 --> 00:35:45,257
... to give and show generous
to his unders.

317
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:50,087
Now we're back to where we were.

318
00:35:50,347 --> 00:35:51,675
Yes?

319
00:35:52,515 --> 00:35:54,803
Just Iike before,
and aII forgotten?

320
00:35:55,059 --> 00:35:56,683
Right, right, right?

321
00:35:58,436 --> 00:35:59,550
Right.

322
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,559
Right.

323
00:36:07,025 --> 00:36:08,056
Right.

324
00:36:10,986 --> 00:36:13,144
WeII, Georgie-boy. . .

325
00:36:13,529 --> 00:36:17,396
. . .this idea of yours for tonight.
TeII us aII about it, then.

326
00:36:19,075 --> 00:36:20,154
Not tonight.

327
00:36:20,409 --> 00:36:22,068
Not this nochy.

328
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:25,275
Come, come, come, Georgie-boy.

329
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:29,162
You're a big, strong cheIIoveck,
Iike us aII.

330
00:36:29,415 --> 00:36:32,700
We're not IittIe chiIdren,
are we, Georgie-boy?

331
00:36:33,376 --> 00:36:36,993
What, then, didst thou
in thy mind have?

332
00:36:43,883 --> 00:36:45,756
It's this health farm.

333
00:36:46,885 --> 00:36:48,877
A bit out of the town.

334
00:36:49,887 --> 00:36:51,381
Isolated.

335
00:36:52,472 --> 00:36:57,097
It's owned by this rich ptitsa
who lives there with her cats.

336
00:36:57,726 --> 00:37:02,220
The place is shut down for a week
and she's completely on her own.

337
00:37:03,563 --> 00:37:07,262
It's full up with, like,
gold and silver...

338
00:37:07,524 --> 00:37:09,516
...and, like, Jewels.

339
00:37:10,984 --> 00:37:14,851
Tell me more, Georgie-boy.
Tell me more.

340
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:21,860
Oh, shit!

341
00:37:40,713 --> 00:37:41,542
Who's there?

342
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,122
Excuse me, can you pIease heIp?

343
00:37:44,382 --> 00:37:45,875
There's been a terribIe accident!

344
00:37:46,133 --> 00:37:49,049
Can I pIease use your teIephone
for an ambuIance?

345
00:37:50,136 --> 00:37:52,092
I'm frightfuIIy sorry.

346
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:56,552
There's a teIephone in the
pubIic house a miIe down the road.

347
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:58,597
I suggest you use that.

348
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,889
But missus, this is an emergency!

349
00:38:01,143 --> 00:38:02,934
It's a matter of Iife and death!

350
00:38:03,186 --> 00:38:06,969
Me friend's Iying in the middIe
of the road, bIeeding to death!

351
00:38:07,897 --> 00:38:12,937
I'm very sorry, but I never open
the door to strangers after dark.

352
00:38:15,277 --> 00:38:17,068
Very weII, madam.

353
00:38:17,487 --> 00:38:19,693
You can't be bIamed
for being suspicious. . .

354
00:38:19,947 --> 00:38:23,730
. . .with so many scoundreIs
and rogues of the night about.

355
00:38:23,991 --> 00:38:26,529
I'II try and get heIp
at the pub, then.

356
00:38:26,785 --> 00:38:29,240
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.

357
00:38:29,495 --> 00:38:32,578
Thank you very much.
Good night.

358
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:10,605
Dim, bend down.

359
00:39:12,941 --> 00:39:15,857
I'II get in that window
and open the front door.

360
00:39:44,462 --> 00:39:46,253
RadIett PoIice Station?

361
00:39:46,505 --> 00:39:50,418
Good evening. It's Miss Weathers
at Woodmere HeaIth Farm.

362
00:39:52,425 --> 00:39:56,374
I'm sorry to bother you, but
something rather odd just happened.

363
00:39:56,637 --> 00:39:59,471
It's probabIy nothing at aII,
but you never know.

364
00:40:00,389 --> 00:40:03,757
A young man rang the beII,
asking to use the teIephone.

365
00:40:04,017 --> 00:40:06,258
He said there's been
some kind of accident.

366
00:40:06,518 --> 00:40:08,973
The thing that caught my
attention was what he said.

367
00:40:09,228 --> 00:40:13,094
His words sounded Iike those quoted
in the papers this morning. . .

368
00:40:13,356 --> 00:40:17,566
. . .in connection with the writer
and his wife who were assauIted.

369
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,899
Just a few minutes ago.

370
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:24,945
If you think that's necessary.

371
00:40:25,197 --> 00:40:27,901
But I'm quite sure
he's gone away now.

372
00:40:29,534 --> 00:40:31,241
AII right, fine.

373
00:40:32,202 --> 00:40:34,324
Thank you very much.

374
00:40:38,873 --> 00:40:40,497
Hi, hi, hi, there.

375
00:40:40,749 --> 00:40:42,077
At Iast we meet.

376
00:40:42,334 --> 00:40:46,994
Our brief govorett through the
Ietter-hoIe was not satisfactory.

377
00:40:48,296 --> 00:40:49,541
Who are you?

378
00:40:50,798 --> 00:40:52,754
How the heII did you get in here?

379
00:40:54,675 --> 00:40:58,008
What the bIoody heII
do you think you're doing?

380
00:41:02,014 --> 00:41:03,804
Naughty, naughty, naughty!

381
00:41:04,057 --> 00:41:06,677
You fiIthy oId soomaka.

382
00:41:06,933 --> 00:41:10,515
Now Iisten here,
you IittIe bastard!

383
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:14,220
Just turn round and waIk out
of here the same way you came in.

384
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,934
Leave that aIone!
Don't touch it!

385
00:41:19,192 --> 00:41:21,598
It's a very important work of art.

386
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:34,864
What the bIoody heII do you want?

387
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:39,073
To be perfectIy honest, madam. . .

388
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,663
. . .I'm taking part in an
internationaI students' contest. . .

389
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:46,663
. . .to see who can get the most
points for seIIing magazines.

390
00:41:46,918 --> 00:41:49,041
Cut the shit, sonny. . .

391
00:41:49,295 --> 00:41:53,837
. . .and get out of here before you
get yourseIf into serious troubIe.

392
00:41:54,173 --> 00:41:57,209
I toId you to Ieave that aIone!
Now get out of here. . .

393
00:41:57,467 --> 00:41:59,340
. . .before I throw you out!

394
00:41:59,844 --> 00:42:02,678
Wretched, sIummy bedbug!

395
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:06,920
I'II teach you to break
into reaI peopIe's houses.

396
00:42:08,183 --> 00:42:09,096
Fucking. . .

397
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,346
. . .IittIe. . .

398
00:42:10,935 --> 00:42:12,428
. . .bastard!

399
00:43:22,065 --> 00:43:25,018
-Let's go. The poIice are coming!
-One minoota, droogie.

400
00:43:31,738 --> 00:43:34,525
You bastards! I'm bIind!

401
00:43:34,782 --> 00:43:38,825
I'm bIind, you bastards!
I can't see!

402
00:43:52,669 --> 00:43:55,871
It's no good sitting there in hope,
my IittIe brothers.

403
00:43:56,088 --> 00:44:00,416
I won't say a singIe soIitary
sIovo unIess I have my Iawyer here.

404
00:44:00,758 --> 00:44:03,295
I know the Iaw, you bastards.

405
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:12,841
Righty-right, Tom.

406
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:18,216
We'II have to show our friend AIex
here that we know the Iaw too.

407
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,140
But that knowing the Iaw
isn't everything.

408
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:38,658
Nasty cut you've got there,
IittIe AIex.

409
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,609
Shame, isn't it?

410
00:44:42,494 --> 00:44:44,533
SpoiIs aII your beauty.

411
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:48,157
Who gave you that, then?

412
00:44:49,665 --> 00:44:51,325
How'd you do that, then?

413
00:44:53,877 --> 00:44:55,952
What's your point, you bastard?

414
00:44:56,211 --> 00:44:58,417
That is for your Iady victim.

415
00:44:58,671 --> 00:44:59,916
You ghastIy. . .

416
00:45:00,172 --> 00:45:01,915
. . .wretched scoundreI.

417
00:45:04,258 --> 00:45:05,456
Get him off me!

418
00:45:06,427 --> 00:45:08,549
You rotten IittIe bastard!

419
00:45:16,809 --> 00:45:18,053
Good evening, Mr. DeItoid.

420
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:19,969
Good evening, Sergeant.

421
00:45:20,227 --> 00:45:21,306
They're in room B, sir.

422
00:45:21,562 --> 00:45:23,221
Thank you very much.

423
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:25,344
Sergeant--

424
00:45:25,606 --> 00:45:26,555
Good evening.

425
00:45:26,815 --> 00:45:28,309
Good evening, Inspector.

426
00:45:28,566 --> 00:45:31,483
-WouId you Iike your tea now, sir?
-No, thank you, Sergeant.

427
00:45:31,735 --> 00:45:33,692
May I have some
paper toweIs, pIease?

428
00:45:33,945 --> 00:45:36,186
We're interrogating
the prisoner now.

429
00:45:36,447 --> 00:45:40,028
-Perhaps you'd care to come inside.
-Thank you very much.

430
00:45:40,658 --> 00:45:43,611
Good evening, Sergeant.
Good evening, aII.

431
00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:48,703
Oh, dear! This boy
does Iook a mess, doesn't he?

432
00:45:48,997 --> 00:45:50,823
Just Iook at the state of him.

433
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,038
Love's young nightmare-Iike.

434
00:45:53,291 --> 00:45:55,200
VioIence makes vioIence.

435
00:45:55,459 --> 00:45:57,451
He resisted his IawfuI arrestors.

436
00:45:58,962 --> 00:46:02,211
This is the end of the Iine for me.

437
00:46:02,464 --> 00:46:05,630
The end of the Iine, yes.

438
00:46:05,966 --> 00:46:07,425
And what of me, brother sir?

439
00:46:07,676 --> 00:46:09,335
Speak up for me.
I'm not so bad.

440
00:46:09,635 --> 00:46:11,592
I was Ied on by
the treachery of others.

441
00:46:11,887 --> 00:46:14,721
Sings the roof off IoveIy,
he does, sir.

442
00:46:15,014 --> 00:46:18,263
Where are my treacherous droogs?
Get them before they get away!

443
00:46:18,516 --> 00:46:20,343
It was aII their idea, brothers.

444
00:46:20,601 --> 00:46:23,270
They forced me to do it.
I'm innocent!

445
00:46:29,982 --> 00:46:32,733
You are now a murderer,
IittIe AIex.

446
00:46:33,401 --> 00:46:34,729
A murderer.

447
00:46:35,528 --> 00:46:37,520
Not true, sir.

448
00:46:37,779 --> 00:46:39,570
It was onIy a sIight toIchok.

449
00:46:39,822 --> 00:46:42,359
She were breathing, I swear it.

450
00:46:42,783 --> 00:46:45,024
I've just come from the hospitaI.

451
00:46:45,284 --> 00:46:47,572
Your victim has died.

452
00:46:47,828 --> 00:46:50,993
You try to frighten me.
Admit so, sir.

453
00:46:51,246 --> 00:46:53,203
This is some new form of torture.

454
00:46:53,456 --> 00:46:56,741
-Say it, brother sir.
-It'II be your own torture.

455
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,783
I hope to God
it'II torture you to madness.

456
00:47:02,629 --> 00:47:05,712
If you'd care to give him a bash
in the chops, don't mind us.

457
00:47:05,965 --> 00:47:07,755
We'II hoId him down.

458
00:47:08,466 --> 00:47:11,668
He must be a great
disappointment to you, sir.

459
00:47:41,113 --> 00:47:44,777
This is the real weepy and tragic
part of the story beginning...

460
00:47:45,032 --> 00:47:47,238
... O my brothers and only friends.

461
00:47:47,492 --> 00:47:49,947
After a trial,
with Judges and a Jury...

462
00:47:50,202 --> 00:47:54,448
...and hard words spoken against
your friend and humble narrator...

463
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:58,784
...he was sentenced to 1 4 years
in StaJa Number 84-F...

464
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:02,575
...among smelly perverts
and hardened prestoopniks.

465
00:48:02,836 --> 00:48:06,667
The shock sending my dada beating
his bruised and krovvy rookers...

466
00:48:06,922 --> 00:48:09,246
...against unfair Bog
in His Heaven.

467
00:48:09,507 --> 00:48:12,709
And my mum boo-hoo-hooing
in her mother's grief...

468
00:48:12,968 --> 00:48:15,339
...at her only child
and son of her bosom...

469
00:48:15,594 --> 00:48:18,215
...like, letting everybody down
real horrorshow.

470
00:48:18,471 --> 00:48:21,341
Morning.
One up from Thames, mister.

471
00:48:22,391 --> 00:48:24,015
Right! Open up the ceII!

472
00:48:24,267 --> 00:48:25,677

473
00:48:41,987 --> 00:48:44,228
Here are the prisoner's
committaI forms.

474
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:45,982

Take the cuffs off him, mister.

You are now 655321 .

486
00:49:22,347 --> 00:49:25,632
It is your duty

Thank you, mister. WeII done.

488
00:49:28,185 --> 00:49:29,892
-Thank you.
-Let the officer out.

489
00:49:34,189 --> 00:49:36,679
AII right, empty your pockets.

490
00:49:40,401 --> 00:49:43,520
Are you abIe to see the white Iine

491
00:49:43,778 --> 00:49:45,106
. . .directIy behind you. . .

. . .655321 ?

493
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:50,609
Then your toes beIong. . .

494
00:49:50,866 --> 00:49:52,823
. . .on the other side of it!

495
00:49:59,831 --> 00:50:01,538
-Yes, sir.
-Right.

496
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,285
Carry on.

497
00:50:08,128 --> 00:50:09,041
Pick that up. . .

498
00:50:09,295 --> 00:50:12,082
. . .and put it down properIy.

499
00:50:22,888 --> 00:50:24,880
One haIf-bar of chocoIate.

00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,843
One bunch of keys

One packet of cigarettes.

502
00:50:38,064 --> 00:50:40,140
Two pIastic baII pens.

503
00:50:40,399 --> 00:50:42,475

00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:18,668
-No, sir.
-Right.

511
00:51:18,925 --> 00:51:22,044

00:51:34,769 --> 00:51:36,844
. . .as you are now convicted.

515
00:51:37,729 --> 00:51:40,931
Now over to the tabIe

516
00:51:47,986 --> 00:51:49,978

One pair of boots, bIack Ieather.
Zippered. Worn.

533
00:52:20,466 --> 00:52:23,003

534
00:52:23,426 --> 00:52:27,126

One pair of underpants,
white with bIue waistband.

540
00:52:40,021 --> 00:52:43,720
Are you now, or have you ever been,

541
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:45,055
Right.

542
00:52:45,316 --> 00:52:47,853
-The mothbaIIs, mister.
-MothbaIIs, sir.

543
00:52:48,818 --> 00:52:50,193

00:52:50,611 --> 00:52:53,280
. . .bend over and touch your toes.

545
00:52:59,867 --> 00:53:01,409
Any venereaI disease?

546
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:03,154
Crabs? Lice?

547
00:53:03,411 --> 00:53:06,411
-Through there for the bath.
-One for a bath.

548
00:53:08,456 --> 00:53:09,736
What's it going to be, eh?

549
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:14,123
Is it going to be in and out
of institutions Iike this. . .

550
00:53:14,377 --> 00:53:16,369
. . .though more in than out
for most of you?

551
00:53:16,629 --> 00:53:20,707
Or are you going to attend
to the divine word. . .

552
00:53:20,965 --> 00:53:24,664
. . .and reaIize the punishments
that await unrepentant sinners. . .

553
00:53:24,926 --> 00:53:27,001
. . .in the next worId
as weII as this?

554
00:53:27,261 --> 00:53:29,300
A Iot of idiots you are. . .

555
00:53:29,554 --> 00:53:34,214
. . .seIIing your birthright
for a saucer of coId porridge.

556
00:53:34,474 --> 00:53:36,181
The thriII of theft.

557
00:53:36,433 --> 00:53:37,263
Of vioIence.

558
00:53:37,518 --> 00:53:40,186
The urge to Iive easy.

559
00:53:40,436 --> 00:53:43,105
WeII, I ask you what is it worth. . .

560
00:53:43,355 --> 00:53:45,679
. . .when we have undeniabIe proof. . .

561
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:49,059
. . .yes, incontrovertibIe
evidence. . .

562
00:53:49,317 --> 00:53:50,645
. . .that heII exists?

563
00:53:50,901 --> 00:53:52,099
I know!

564
00:53:52,361 --> 00:53:54,898
I know, my friends.

565
00:53:55,154 --> 00:53:57,230
I have been informed. . .

566
00:53:57,489 --> 00:53:58,983
. . .in visions. . .

567
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,699
. . .that there is a pIace. . .

568
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:03,357
. . .darker than any prison. . .

569
00:54:03,618 --> 00:54:07,662
. . .hotter than any fIame
of human fire. . .

570
00:54:07,913 --> 00:54:09,241
. . .where souIs. . .

571
00:54:09,497 --> 00:54:13,707
. . .of unrepentant criminaI sinners
Iike yourseIves--

572
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:19,248
Don't you Iaugh, damn you!
Don't you Iaugh.

573
00:54:19,504 --> 00:54:22,504
I say, Iike yourseIves. . .

574
00:54:23,048 --> 00:54:24,328
. . .scream. . .

575
00:54:24,757 --> 00:54:28,421
. . .in endIess and
unendurabIe agony.

576
00:54:29,177 --> 00:54:30,552
Their skin. . .

577
00:54:30,803 --> 00:54:33,293
. . .rotting and peeIing.

578
00:54:33,555 --> 00:54:35,298
A firebaII. . .

579
00:54:35,556 --> 00:54:37,881
. . .spinning in their
screaming guts!

580
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:41,556
I know. Yes, I know!

581
00:54:47,856 --> 00:54:50,856
AII right, you Iot!
We'II end by singing hymn 258. . .

582
00:54:51,108 --> 00:54:52,388
. . .in the prisoner's hymnaI.

583
00:54:52,651 --> 00:54:55,853
And Iet's have a IittIe reverence,
you bastards!

584
00:54:57,529 --> 00:55:00,814
I was a wandering sheep

585
00:55:01,907 --> 00:55:04,528
-Sing up, damn you!
-I did not love the fold

586
00:55:04,784 --> 00:55:06,194
Louder!

587
00:55:08,537 --> 00:55:13,529
I did not love my shepherd's voice

588
00:55:14,165 --> 00:55:18,541
I would not be controlled

589
00:55:19,669 --> 00:55:20,783
Louder!

590
00:55:21,253 --> 00:55:24,289
It had not been edifying.
Indeed not.

591
00:55:24,547 --> 00:55:28,460
Being in this hellhole
and human zoo for two years now.

592
00:55:28,717 --> 00:55:31,835
Being kicked and tolchoked
by brutal warders...

593
00:55:32,094 --> 00:55:35,047
...and meeting leering criminals
and perverts...

594
00:55:35,304 --> 00:55:36,846
...ready to dribble all over...

595
00:55:37,097 --> 00:55:40,014
...a luscious young malchick
like your storyteller.

596
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,514
It was my rabbit...

597
00:55:47,771 --> 00:55:50,522
... to help the prison charlie
with the Sunday service.

598
00:55:50,773 --> 00:55:53,808
He was a bolshy,
great burly bastard.

599
00:55:54,067 --> 00:55:57,102
But he was very fond of myself,
me being very young...

600
00:55:57,361 --> 00:56:00,776
...and also now very interested
in the Big Book.

601
00:56:21,877 --> 00:56:25,708
I read all about the scourging
and the crowning with thorns.

602
00:56:25,963 --> 00:56:27,836
And I could viddy myself
helping in...

603
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:32,038
...and even taking charge of
the tolchoking and the nailing in.

604
00:56:32,301 --> 00:56:35,633
Being dressed in the height
of Roman fashion.

605
00:56:47,561 --> 00:56:50,051
I didn 't so much like
the latter part of the Book...

606
00:56:50,313 --> 00:56:52,435
... which is more like
all preachy talking...

607
00:56:52,689 --> 00:56:54,847
... than fighting
and the old in-out.

608
00:56:55,108 --> 00:56:58,226
I like the parts where these old
yahoodies tolchok each other...

609
00:56:58,485 --> 00:57:00,726
...and then drink
their Hebrew vino...

610
00:57:01,112 --> 00:57:04,147
...and getting onto the bed
with their wives ' handmaidens.

611
00:57:04,406 --> 00:57:06,444
That kept me going.

612
00:57:37,761 --> 00:57:40,678
''Seek not to be Iike eviI men.

613
00:57:41,097 --> 00:57:43,219
Neither desire to be with them. . .

614
00:57:43,473 --> 00:57:46,557
. . .because their minds
studieth robberies. . .

615
00:57:46,809 --> 00:57:49,725
. . .and their Iips speak deceits. ''

616
00:57:49,978 --> 00:57:53,476
If thou Iose hope, being weary
in the days of distress. . .

617
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:55,971
. . .thy strength
shaII be diminished.

618
00:57:56,232 --> 00:57:57,891
Fine, my son. Fine.

619
00:57:58,150 --> 00:57:59,394
Father?

620
00:58:03,445 --> 00:58:05,188
I have tried, have I not?

621
00:58:05,446 --> 00:58:06,525
You have, my son.

622
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:09,105
-I've done my best, have I not?
-Indeed.

623
00:58:09,366 --> 00:58:12,733
I've never been guiIty of any
institutionaI infraction, have I?

624
00:58:12,993 --> 00:58:17,321
You certainIy have not, 655321 .
You've been very heIpfuI.

625
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:20,449
And you've shown
a genuine desire to reform.

626
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:21,986
Father. . .

627
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:26,244
. . .can I ask you
a question in private?

628
00:58:27,878 --> 00:58:29,786
CertainIy, my son. CertainIy.

629
00:58:39,969 --> 00:58:42,506
Is there something
troubIing you, my son?

630
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:47,928
Don't be shy to speak up.

631
00:58:50,435 --> 00:58:51,763
Remember. . .

632
00:58:52,019 --> 00:58:53,975
. . .I know of the. . .

633
00:58:54,229 --> 00:58:58,059
. . .urges that can
troubIe young men. . .

634
00:58:58,315 --> 00:58:59,809
. . .deprived. . .

635
00:59:00,066 --> 00:59:02,058
. . .of the society of women.

636
00:59:04,944 --> 00:59:07,269
It's nothing Iike that, Father.

637
00:59:11,032 --> 00:59:14,400
It's about this new thing
they're aII taIking about.

638
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:16,610
About this new treatment.

639
00:59:16,869 --> 00:59:19,193
It gets you out of prison
in no time.

640
00:59:19,454 --> 00:59:22,026
And makes sure you
never get back in again.

641
00:59:22,831 --> 00:59:25,072
Where did you hear about this?

642
00:59:25,333 --> 00:59:28,001
Who's been taIking
about these things?

643
00:59:28,293 --> 00:59:30,700
These things get around.

644
00:59:30,962 --> 00:59:33,203
Two warders taIk, as it might be.

645
00:59:33,463 --> 00:59:36,499
And somebody can't heIp
overhearing what they say.

646
00:59:37,049 --> 00:59:40,417
Then somebody picks up a scrap
of newspaper in the workshops. . .

647
00:59:40,676 --> 00:59:43,249
. . .and the newspaper
teIIs aII about it.

648
00:59:46,222 --> 00:59:49,921
How about putting me in
for this new treatment?

649
00:59:51,559 --> 00:59:55,223
I take it you are referring. . .

650
00:59:55,478 --> 00:59:57,719
. . .to the Ludovico technique.

651
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,804
I don't know what it's caIIed.

652
01:00:01,065 --> 01:00:02,938
I just know it
gets you out quickIy. . .

653
01:00:03,191 --> 01:00:05,682
. . .and makes sure you
never get back in again.

654
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:09,236
That is not proven, 655321 .

655
01:00:09,487 --> 01:00:13,649
In fact, it is onIy in the
experimentaI stage at this moment.

656
01:00:14,115 --> 01:00:16,866
It has been used, hasn't it?

657
01:00:17,117 --> 01:00:19,868
It has not been used
in this prison yet.

658
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:22,574
The governor has grave
doubts about it.

659
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:26,529
And I've heard there are
very serious dangers invoIved.

660
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:31,376
I don't care about the dangers.

661
01:00:33,086 --> 01:00:35,244
I just want to be good.

662
01:00:36,505 --> 01:00:39,174
I want for the rest
of my Iife to be. . .

663
01:00:39,424 --> 01:00:41,499
. . .one act of goodness.

664
01:00:41,759 --> 01:00:43,217
The question is. . .

665
01:00:43,635 --> 01:00:48,260
. . .whether or not this technique
reaIIy makes a man good.

666
01:00:49,097 --> 01:00:51,385
Goodness comes from within.

667
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:52,755
Goodness. . .

668
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:54,391
. . .is chosen.

669
01:00:54,768 --> 01:00:56,890
When a man cannot choose. . .

670
01:00:57,144 --> 01:00:59,266
. . .he ceases to be a man.

671
01:01:01,063 --> 01:01:05,973
I don't understand about
the whys and wherefores, Father.

672
01:01:07,192 --> 01:01:10,109
I onIy know I want to be good.

673
01:01:12,238 --> 01:01:14,146
Be patient, my son.

674
01:01:14,406 --> 01:01:16,647
Put your trust in the Lord.

675
01:01:18,575 --> 01:01:22,157
Instruct Thy Son
and He shaII refresh thee. . .

676
01:01:22,411 --> 01:01:25,281
. . .and shaII give deIight
to thy souI.

677
01:01:25,913 --> 01:01:27,158
Amen.

678
01:01:54,933 --> 01:01:56,889
-Mister!
-AII present and correct, sir!

679
01:01:57,142 --> 01:01:58,173
Right!

680
01:01:59,769 --> 01:02:01,845
AII present and correct, sir!

681
01:02:57,391 --> 01:02:58,933
Prisoners, haIt!

682
01:02:59,476 --> 01:03:01,100
Now pay attention!

683
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:03,553
I want you in two Iines. . .

684
01:03:03,812 --> 01:03:06,480
. . .up against that waII,
facing this way.

685
01:03:06,731 --> 01:03:08,272
Go on, move!

686
01:03:08,774 --> 01:03:09,769
Hurry up!

687
01:03:10,024 --> 01:03:11,304
Stop taIking!

688
01:03:17,154 --> 01:03:19,727
Prisoners ready
for inspection, sir!

689
01:03:35,708 --> 01:03:36,870
How many to a ceII?

690
01:03:37,126 --> 01:03:38,999
Four in this bIock, sir.

691
01:03:39,878 --> 01:03:42,119
Cram criminaIs together
and what do you get?

692
01:03:42,379 --> 01:03:45,545
Concentrated criminaIity.
Crime in the midst of punishment.

693
01:03:45,798 --> 01:03:49,462
I agree, sir. We need
Iarger prisons, more money.

694
01:03:49,718 --> 01:03:51,508
Not a chance, my dear feIIow.

695
01:03:51,761 --> 01:03:54,085
The government can't be
concerned any Ionger. . .

696
01:03:54,346 --> 01:03:56,053
. . .with outmoded
penaIogicaI theories.

697
01:03:56,347 --> 01:03:59,964
Soon we may need aII prison
space for poIiticaI offenders.

698
01:04:00,225 --> 01:04:03,758
Common criminaIs are best deaIt
with on a pureIy curative basis.

699
01:04:04,019 --> 01:04:06,723
KiII the criminaI refIex,
that's aII.

700
01:04:06,979 --> 01:04:09,185
FuII impIementation
in a year's time.

701
01:04:09,439 --> 01:04:11,680
Punishment means nothing to them.

702
01:04:11,941 --> 01:04:14,857
They enjoy their
so-caIIed punishment.

703
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:16,265
You're absoIuteIy right, sir.

704
01:04:16,527 --> 01:04:19,100
Shut your bIeeding hoIe!

705
01:04:19,738 --> 01:04:21,279
Who said that?

706
01:04:21,906 --> 01:04:23,316
I did, sir.

707
01:04:29,577 --> 01:04:31,285
What crime did you commit?

708
01:04:31,537 --> 01:04:33,612
The accidentaI kiIIing
of a person, sir.

709
01:04:33,872 --> 01:04:36,576
He brutaIIy murdered a woman
in furtherance of theft.

710
01:04:36,832 --> 01:04:38,456
Fourteen years, sir.

711
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:40,913
ExceIIent.

712
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:43,623
He's enterprising. . .

713
01:04:43,879 --> 01:04:44,958
. . .aggressive. . .

714
01:04:45,213 --> 01:04:46,375
. . .outgoing. . .

715
01:04:46,631 --> 01:04:47,460
. . .young. . .

716
01:04:47,715 --> 01:04:48,995
. . .boId. . .

717
01:04:49,257 --> 01:04:50,751
. . .vicious.

718
01:04:51,259 --> 01:04:52,289
He'II do.

719
01:04:52,551 --> 01:04:53,665
Fine.

720
01:04:53,927 --> 01:04:55,421
We couId stiII Iook at C-bIock.

721
01:04:55,678 --> 01:04:57,717
No, no. That's enough.
He's perfect.

722
01:04:57,971 --> 01:04:59,679
I want his records sent to me.

723
01:04:59,931 --> 01:05:01,259
This vicious young hoodIum. . .

724
01:05:01,515 --> 01:05:03,424
. . .wiII be transformed
out of aII recognition.

725
01:05:03,684 --> 01:05:05,640
Thank you very much
for this chance.

726
01:05:05,893 --> 01:05:08,680
Let's hope you make
the most of it, my boy.

727
01:05:08,979 --> 01:05:11,469
-ShaII we go to my office?
-Thank you.

728
01:05:18,277 --> 01:05:19,557
Come in.

729
01:05:21,362 --> 01:05:22,192
Sir!

730
01:05:22,446 --> 01:05:24,319
655321 . Sir!

731
01:05:24,572 --> 01:05:25,568
Very good, Chief.

732
01:05:25,823 --> 01:05:27,365
Over to the Iine.
Toes behind it.

733
01:05:27,616 --> 01:05:30,106
FuII name and number
to the governor.

734
01:05:30,952 --> 01:05:34,154
AIexander DeLarge, sir.
655321 , sir.

735
01:05:36,831 --> 01:05:39,949
I don't suppose you know who
that was this morning.

736
01:05:40,208 --> 01:05:43,825
That was no Iess a personage
than the Minister of the Interior.

737
01:05:44,086 --> 01:05:46,042
The new Minister of the Interior.

738
01:05:46,295 --> 01:05:49,212
What they caII a very new broom.

739
01:05:50,381 --> 01:05:53,832
These new ridicuIous ideas
have come at Iast.

740
01:05:54,092 --> 01:05:56,380
And orders are orders. . .

741
01:05:56,636 --> 01:06:00,169
. . .though I may say to you
in confidence, I do not approve.

742
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:02,671
An eye for an eye, I say.

743
01:06:02,931 --> 01:06:05,884
If someone hits you,
you hit back, do you not?

744
01:06:06,142 --> 01:06:09,841
Why shouId not the state,
severeIy hit by you hooIigans. . .

745
01:06:10,103 --> 01:06:11,894
. . .not hit back aIso?

746
01:06:12,771 --> 01:06:14,728
The new view is to say ''no. ''

747
01:06:14,981 --> 01:06:18,349
The new view is that
we turn the bad into good.

748
01:06:18,609 --> 01:06:21,562
AII of which seems to me
to be grossIy unjust.

749
01:06:21,986 --> 01:06:24,523
Shut your fiIthy hoIe, you scum!

750
01:06:24,988 --> 01:06:27,193
You are to be reformed.

751
01:06:28,031 --> 01:06:30,522
Tomorrow you wiII go
to this man, Brodsky.

752
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:32,360
You wiII be Ieaving here.

753
01:06:32,618 --> 01:06:36,863
You wiII be transferred to
the Ludovico medicaI faciIity.

754
01:06:37,163 --> 01:06:41,076
It's beIieved you'II be abIe to
Ieave state custody in a fortnight.

755
01:06:41,332 --> 01:06:43,205
I suppose that prospect
pIeases you?

756
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:45,249
Answer the governor's question!

757
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:46,829
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much.

758
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:49,410
I've done my best here,
I reaIIy have, sir.

759
01:06:49,671 --> 01:06:51,912
I'm very gratefuI
to aII concerned, sir.

760
01:06:54,132 --> 01:06:56,539
Sign this where it's marked.

761
01:06:59,719 --> 01:07:01,758
Don't read it, sign it!

762
01:07:02,054 --> 01:07:05,718
It says you're wiIIing to have
your sentence commuted. . .

763
01:07:05,973 --> 01:07:08,926
. . .to submission to
the Ludovico treatment.

764
01:07:09,184 --> 01:07:10,512
And this.

765
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:19,267
And another copy.

766
01:07:31,824 --> 01:07:33,650
The next morning I was taken to...

767
01:07:33,909 --> 01:07:35,568
... the Ludovico medical facility...

768
01:07:35,827 --> 01:07:37,653
...outside the town center.

769
01:07:37,911 --> 01:07:39,405
I felt a malenky bit sad...

770
01:07:39,663 --> 01:07:41,571
...having to say goodbye
to the old StaJa...

771
01:07:41,831 --> 01:07:45,080
...as you will, when you leave
a place you've gotten used to.

772
01:07:45,333 --> 01:07:47,290
Right, haIt the prisoner.

773
01:07:52,796 --> 01:07:55,251
Good morning, sir.
I'm Chief Officer Barnes.

774
01:07:55,507 --> 01:07:57,297
I've got 655321 . . .

775
01:07:57,550 --> 01:08:01,213
. . .on a transfer from Parkmoor
to the Ludovico Centre, sir.

776
01:08:01,552 --> 01:08:04,125
Good morning.
Yes, we've been expecting you.

777
01:08:04,387 --> 01:08:05,667
I'm Dr. AIcot.

778
01:08:07,973 --> 01:08:08,922
Dr. AIcot.

779
01:08:09,182 --> 01:08:10,557
Very good, sir.

780
01:08:14,311 --> 01:08:17,429
-Are you prepared for the prisoner?
-Yes, of course.

781
01:08:17,688 --> 01:08:21,684
I wonder if you'd mind signing
these documents, sir.

782
01:08:22,566 --> 01:08:23,977
There, sir.

783
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:36,860
And there, sir.

784
01:08:42,329 --> 01:08:43,907
And there.

785
01:09:02,843 --> 01:09:04,385
There you are.

786
01:09:06,512 --> 01:09:08,421
Prison escort, move forward!

787
01:09:11,599 --> 01:09:12,761
HaIt!

788
01:09:14,851 --> 01:09:16,558
Excuse me, sir.

789
01:09:23,107 --> 01:09:26,356
Is that the officer who wiII
take charge of the prisoner?

790
01:09:35,907 --> 01:09:39,405
A word of advice, doc.
You'II have to watch this one.

791
01:09:39,659 --> 01:09:43,193
A right brutaI bastard he has been,
and wiII be again. . .

792
01:09:43,454 --> 01:09:46,619
. . .in spite of aII his sucking up
and reading the BibIe.

793
01:09:46,872 --> 01:09:50,536
We can manage things.
Show the young man to his room.

794
01:09:50,792 --> 01:09:53,543
Right, sir. Come this way, pIease.

795
01:10:02,299 --> 01:10:04,872
-Morning, CharIie.
-Good morning, Doctor.

796
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:07,166
Good morning, AIex.

797
01:10:07,428 --> 01:10:10,000
My name is Dr. Branom.
I'm Dr. Brodsky's assistant.

798
01:10:10,263 --> 01:10:11,887
Good morning, missus.
LoveIy day.

799
01:10:12,139 --> 01:10:13,384
Indeed, it is.

800
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,217
May I take that?

801
01:10:18,894 --> 01:10:21,384
-How are you feeIing?
-Fine, fine.

802
01:10:21,646 --> 01:10:24,599
Good. In a few minutes
you'II meet Dr. Brodsky. . .

803
01:10:24,856 --> 01:10:26,136
. . .and begin your treatment.

804
01:10:26,691 --> 01:10:29,263
You're a very Iucky boy
to have been chosen.

805
01:10:31,194 --> 01:10:33,731
I reaIize that,
and I'm very gratefuI.

806
01:10:34,071 --> 01:10:36,193
We're going to be friends,
aren't we?

807
01:10:36,447 --> 01:10:37,775
I hope so, missus.

808
01:10:40,909 --> 01:10:43,315
What's the hypo for?
Sending me to sIeep?

809
01:10:43,577 --> 01:10:44,857
Nothing of the sort.

810
01:10:45,328 --> 01:10:48,032
-Vitamins wiII it be, then?
-Something Iike that.

811
01:10:48,539 --> 01:10:52,487
You're undernourished, so after
each meaI we'II give you a shot.

812
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:54,208
RoII over on your right side.

813
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:57,293
Loosen your pajama pants
and puII them haIfway down.

814
01:11:07,218 --> 01:11:10,253
What exactIy is the treatment here
going to be, then?

815
01:11:11,345 --> 01:11:13,172
It's quite simpIe, reaIIy.

816
01:11:13,764 --> 01:11:15,555
We're going to show you some fiIms.

817
01:11:15,807 --> 01:11:18,131
You mean Iike
going to the pictures?

818
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,224
Something Iike that.

819
01:11:20,477 --> 01:11:21,306
That's good.

820
01:11:21,561 --> 01:11:24,347
I Iike to viddy
the oId fiIms now and again.

821
01:11:26,397 --> 01:11:28,852
And viddy films I would.

822
01:11:29,357 --> 01:11:31,314
Where I was taken to, brothers...

823
01:11:31,567 --> 01:11:33,725
... was like no cine
I ever viddied before.

824
01:11:34,152 --> 01:11:36,275
I was bound up
in a straitJacket...

825
01:11:36,529 --> 01:11:38,735
...and my gulliver was strapped
to a headrest...

826
01:11:38,989 --> 01:11:41,277
... with wires running away from it.

827
01:11:41,532 --> 01:11:43,820
Then they clamped, like,
lid-locks on me eyes...

828
01:11:44,076 --> 01:11:47,526
...so that I could not shut them,
no matter how hard I tried.

829
01:11:47,786 --> 01:11:49,529
It seemed a bit crazy to me...

830
01:11:49,788 --> 01:11:52,657
...but I let them get on with
what they wanted to get on with.

831
01:11:52,915 --> 01:11:56,283
If I was to be a free malchick
again in a fortnight...

832
01:11:56,542 --> 01:11:59,957
...I would put up with much
in the meantime, O my brothers.

833
01:12:25,437 --> 01:12:28,769
The first film was a very good,
professional piece of cine...

834
01:12:29,022 --> 01:12:30,931
...like it was done in Hollywood.

835
01:12:31,190 --> 01:12:33,313
The sounds were real horrorshow.

836
01:12:33,567 --> 01:12:36,733
You could slooshy the screams
and moans very realistic.

837
01:12:36,986 --> 01:12:39,274
You could even get
the breathing and panting...

838
01:12:39,529 --> 01:12:42,482
...of the tolchocking malchicks
at the same time.

839
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:44,613
And then what do you know?

840
01:12:44,866 --> 01:12:46,988
Soon our dear old friend...

841
01:12:47,243 --> 01:12:49,235
... the red, red vino on tap...

842
01:12:49,494 --> 01:12:50,609
... the same in all places...

843
01:12:50,870 --> 01:12:52,328
...like it's put out
by the same firm...

844
01:12:52,913 --> 01:12:54,490
...began to flow.

845
01:12:54,748 --> 01:12:56,905
It was beautiful.

846
01:12:57,291 --> 01:12:59,579
It's funny how the colors
of the real world...

847
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:01,828
...only seem really real...

848
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:04,292
... when you viddy them
on a screen.

849
01:13:07,214 --> 01:13:09,669
Now, all the time
I was watching this...

850
01:13:09,925 --> 01:13:12,166
...I was beginning
to get very aware...

851
01:13:12,426 --> 01:13:14,584
...of, like, not feeling
all that well.

852
01:13:14,845 --> 01:13:18,711
And this I put down
to all the rich food and vitamins.

853
01:13:18,972 --> 01:13:23,300
But I tried to forget this,
concentrating on the next film...

854
01:13:23,559 --> 01:13:26,227
... which Jumped right away
on a young devotchka...

855
01:13:26,477 --> 01:13:29,311
... who was being given
the old in-out, in-out...

856
01:13:30,188 --> 01:13:32,310
...first by one malchick...

857
01:13:33,107 --> 01:13:34,304
... then another.

858
01:13:35,317 --> 01:13:36,894
Then another.

859
01:13:39,861 --> 01:13:42,268
When it came to
the 6th or 7th malchick...

860
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:46,028
...leering and smecking
and then going into it...

861
01:13:46,282 --> 01:13:49,484
...I began to feel really sick.

862
01:13:50,035 --> 01:13:52,607
But I could not shut me glazzies.

863
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:56,285
And even if I tried to move
my glazzballs about...

864
01:13:56,539 --> 01:13:58,531
...I still could not get out of...

865
01:13:58,791 --> 01:14:01,459
... the line of fire
of this picture.

866
01:14:04,211 --> 01:14:05,788
Get me up.

867
01:14:06,170 --> 01:14:07,961
I'm going to be sick.

868
01:14:08,964 --> 01:14:11,003
Get something for me to be sick in!

869
01:14:15,302 --> 01:14:18,136
Very soon now,
the drug wiII cause the subject. . .

870
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:20,628
. . .to experience
a deathIike paraIysis. . .

871
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:24,719
. . .together with deep feeIings
of terror and heIpIessness.

872
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:29,431
One of our earIy test subjects
described it as being Iike death.

873
01:14:29,686 --> 01:14:32,603
A sense of stifIing or drowning.

874
01:14:33,355 --> 01:14:36,024
And it is during this period,
we have found. . .

875
01:14:36,274 --> 01:14:39,891
. . .the subject wiII make
his most rewarding associations. . .

876
01:14:40,151 --> 01:14:43,899
. . .between his catastrophic
experience, environment. . .

877
01:14:44,154 --> 01:14:46,858
. . .and the vioIence he sees.

878
01:14:49,089 --> 01:14:51,045
Dr. Brodsky is pIeased with you.

879
01:14:51,298 --> 01:14:53,670
You've made
a very positive response.

880
01:14:54,801 --> 01:14:58,667
Tomorrow there wiII be two
sessions, morning and afternoon.

881
01:14:58,929 --> 01:15:01,928
You mean I have to viddy
two sessions in one day?

882
01:15:02,181 --> 01:15:05,346
I imagine you'II feeI a bit
Iimp by the end of the day.

883
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,932
But we have to be hard on you.
You have to be cured.

884
01:15:09,185 --> 01:15:10,216
It was horribIe.

885
01:15:10,478 --> 01:15:12,055
Of course it was horribIe.

886
01:15:12,312 --> 01:15:14,719
VioIence is a very horribIe thing.

887
01:15:14,981 --> 01:15:16,688
That's what you're Iearning now.

888
01:15:16,941 --> 01:15:18,185
Your body's Iearning it.

889
01:15:18,817 --> 01:15:21,568
I just don't understand about
feeIing sick the way I did.

890
01:15:21,819 --> 01:15:25,068
I never used to feeI sick.
I used to feeI the very opposite.

891
01:15:25,321 --> 01:15:28,238
Doing it or watching it,
I used to feeI reaI horrorshow.

892
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:32,607
You feIt iII this afternoon
because you're getting better.

893
01:15:32,868 --> 01:15:36,034
When we're heaIthy,
we respond to the hatefuI. . .

894
01:15:36,287 --> 01:15:38,279
. . .with fear and nausea.

895
01:15:38,538 --> 01:15:40,696
You're becoming heaIthy,
that's aII.

896
01:15:40,957 --> 01:15:44,040
By this time tomorrow,
you'II be heaIthier stiII.

897
01:16:36,702 --> 01:16:38,741
It was the next day, brothers...

898
01:16:38,995 --> 01:16:40,537
...and I had truly done my best...

899
01:16:40,788 --> 01:16:43,243
...morning and afternoon
to play it their way...

900
01:16:43,498 --> 01:16:46,249
...and sit like a horrorshow
cooperative malchick...

901
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:47,994
...in the chair of torture...

902
01:16:48,251 --> 01:16:52,497
... while they flashed nasty bits
of ultra-violence on the screen...

903
01:16:52,963 --> 01:16:57,422
... though not on the soundtrack,
the only sound being music.

904
01:16:58,425 --> 01:17:00,997
Then I noticed,
in all my pain and sickness...

905
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:05,173
... what music it was
that, like, cracked and boomed.

906
01:17:06,097 --> 01:17:08,587
It was Ludwig van.

907
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:11,678
Ninth Symphony, fourth movement.

908
01:17:27,361 --> 01:17:30,396
Stop it! Stop it!
PIease, I beg you!

909
01:17:30,905 --> 01:17:32,149
It's a sin!

910
01:17:32,531 --> 01:17:34,108
It's a sin!

911
01:17:39,619 --> 01:17:40,698
Sin?

912
01:17:40,953 --> 01:17:42,530
What's aII this about sin?

913
01:17:43,038 --> 01:17:43,903
That!

914
01:17:44,164 --> 01:17:48,160
Using Ludwig van Iike that.
He did no harm to anyone.

915
01:17:48,417 --> 01:17:50,823
Beethoven just wrote music.

916
01:17:51,502 --> 01:17:54,668
Are you referring
to the background score?

917
01:17:56,255 --> 01:17:58,164
You've heard Beethoven before?

918
01:18:00,383 --> 01:18:02,256
So you're keen on music?

919
01:18:07,638 --> 01:18:09,381
Can't be heIped.

920
01:18:10,181 --> 01:18:12,967
Here's the punishment
eIement perhaps.

921
01:18:13,975 --> 01:18:16,098
The governor ought to be pIeased.

922
01:18:18,854 --> 01:18:20,762
I'm sorry, AIex.

923
01:18:21,063 --> 01:18:22,806
This is for your own good.

924
01:18:23,065 --> 01:18:25,436
You'II have to bear with us
for a whiIe.

925
01:18:26,233 --> 01:18:29,933
But it's not fair.
It's not fair I shouId feeI iII. . .

926
01:18:30,153 --> 01:18:33,106
. . .when I hear IoveIy,
IoveIy Ludwig van.

927
01:18:33,655 --> 01:18:35,980
You must take your chance, boy.

928
01:18:36,449 --> 01:18:38,939
The choice has been aII yours.

929
01:18:40,451 --> 01:18:43,202
You needn't take it
any further, sir.

930
01:18:43,537 --> 01:18:46,453
You've proved to me aII this
uItra-vioIence and kiIIing. . .

931
01:18:46,705 --> 01:18:49,955
. . .is wrong, wrong
and terribIy wrong!

932
01:18:50,375 --> 01:18:52,117
I've Iearned me Iesson, sir.

933
01:18:52,376 --> 01:18:55,292
I see now what I've
never seen before.

934
01:18:55,545 --> 01:18:58,498
I'm cured. Praise God!

935
01:18:58,797 --> 01:19:01,204
You're not cured yet, boy.

936
01:19:02,091 --> 01:19:03,501
But, sirs.

937
01:19:03,759 --> 01:19:05,133
Missus!

938
01:19:05,468 --> 01:19:07,590
I see that it's wrong!

939
01:19:07,845 --> 01:19:11,888
It's wrong because
it's, Iike, against society.

940
01:19:12,139 --> 01:19:14,808
Because everybody has the
right to Iive and be happy. . .

941
01:19:15,058 --> 01:19:17,844
. . .without being
toIchocked and knifed!

942
01:19:18,101 --> 01:19:21,185
No, no, boy.
You reaIIy must Ieave it to us.

943
01:19:21,437 --> 01:19:23,096
But be cheerfuI about it.

944
01:19:23,355 --> 01:19:26,639
In Iess than a fortnight now,
you'II be a free man.

945
01:20:05,049 --> 01:20:06,247
Ladies and gentIemen. . .

946
01:20:06,509 --> 01:20:09,378
. . .at this stage, we introduce
the subject himseIf.

947
01:20:09,636 --> 01:20:12,589
He is, as you wiII perceive,
fit and weII-nourished.

948
01:20:12,846 --> 01:20:15,680
He comes straight from a night's
sIeep and a good breakfast. . .

949
01:20:15,932 --> 01:20:16,927
. . .undrugged. . .

950
01:20:17,183 --> 01:20:19,009
. . .unhypnotized.

951
01:20:19,267 --> 01:20:22,931
Tomorrow we send him out with
confidence into the worId again. . .

952
01:20:23,187 --> 01:20:26,804
. . .as decent a Iad as you
wouId meet on a May morning.

953
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:30,399
What a change is here,
Iadies and gentIemen.

954
01:20:30,650 --> 01:20:33,021
From the hoodIum
the state committed. . .

955
01:20:33,235 --> 01:20:36,021
. . .to unprofitabIe punishment
two years ago.

956
01:20:36,237 --> 01:20:39,023
Unchanged after two years.

957
01:20:39,781 --> 01:20:41,987
Unchanged, do I say?

958
01:20:42,241 --> 01:20:43,651
Not quite.

959
01:20:43,909 --> 01:20:48,652
Prison taught him the faIse smiIe,
the rubbed hands of hypocrisy.

960
01:20:48,912 --> 01:20:52,196
The fawning, greased,
obsequious Ieer.

961
01:20:52,706 --> 01:20:54,579
Other vices it taught him. . .

962
01:20:54,833 --> 01:20:58,699
. . .as weII as confirming him in
those he had Iong practiced before.

963
01:20:59,919 --> 01:21:02,955
Our party promised
to restore Iaw and order. . .

964
01:21:03,213 --> 01:21:07,257
. . .and to make the streets safe for
the ordinary peace-Ioving citizen.

965
01:21:07,508 --> 01:21:11,551
This pIedge is now
about to become a reaIity.

966
01:21:11,802 --> 01:21:15,502
Ladies and gentIemen,
today is an historic moment.

967
01:21:15,763 --> 01:21:20,258
The probIem of criminaI vioIence
is soon to be a thing of the past.

968
01:21:21,267 --> 01:21:23,175
But enough of words.

969
01:21:23,435 --> 01:21:25,676
Actions speak Iouder than.

970
01:21:25,937 --> 01:21:27,596
Action now.

971
01:21:28,105 --> 01:21:30,061
Observe aII.

972
01:21:39,696 --> 01:21:42,233
Our necks are out
a Iong way on this, Minister.

973
01:21:42,489 --> 01:21:44,612
I have compIete faith in Brodsky.

974
01:21:44,866 --> 01:21:48,032
If the poIIs are right,
we have nothing to Iose.

975
01:21:57,166 --> 01:21:59,490
HeIIo, heap of dirt.

976
01:22:02,294 --> 01:22:06,587
You don't wash much, do you,
judging by the horribIe smeII.

977
01:22:07,131 --> 01:22:09,586
Why do you say that?
I had a shower this morning.

978
01:22:09,841 --> 01:22:12,461
He had a shower this morning.

979
01:22:12,968 --> 01:22:15,043
You trying to caII me a Iiar?

980
01:22:15,303 --> 01:22:16,133
No, brother.

981
01:22:16,512 --> 01:22:19,595
You must think I'm awfuIIy stupid.

982
01:22:25,268 --> 01:22:27,059
Why did you do that, brother?

983
01:22:27,311 --> 01:22:29,267
I've never done wrong to you.

984
01:22:29,521 --> 01:22:31,596
You want to know why I did that?

985
01:22:32,022 --> 01:22:33,053
WeII, you see. . .

986
01:22:33,315 --> 01:22:34,560
. . .I do this. . .

987
01:22:34,816 --> 01:22:36,014
. . .and that. . .

988
01:22:36,275 --> 01:22:39,477
. . .and this because I don't Iike
your horribIe type, do I?

989
01:22:39,736 --> 01:22:42,060
And if you want
to start something. . .

990
01:22:42,321 --> 01:22:44,811
. . .you just go ahead.
Go on!

991
01:22:45,073 --> 01:22:46,270
PIease do!

992
01:22:47,908 --> 01:22:49,734
I'm going to be sick.

993
01:22:50,576 --> 01:22:52,236
You're going to be sick, are you?

994
01:22:52,494 --> 01:22:54,866
I'm going to be sick.
PIease Iet me get up.

995
01:22:55,622 --> 01:22:57,199
You want to get up?

996
01:22:57,623 --> 01:22:59,330
WeII, now you Iisten to me.

997
01:23:00,041 --> 01:23:01,618
If you want to get up. . .

998
01:23:02,126 --> 01:23:04,082
. . .you've got to
do something for me.

999
01:23:04,794 --> 01:23:05,957
Here.

1000
01:23:06,462 --> 01:23:07,576
Here.

1001
01:23:08,297 --> 01:23:09,956
You see that?

1002
01:23:10,965 --> 01:23:12,423
You see that shoe?

1003
01:23:13,759 --> 01:23:15,217
I want you to Iick it.

1004
01:23:15,468 --> 01:23:16,748
Go on!

1005
01:23:17,803 --> 01:23:19,297
Lick it!

1006
01:23:22,389 --> 01:23:24,714
And, O my brothers,
would you believe...

1007
01:23:24,974 --> 01:23:28,259
... your faithful friend
and long-suffering narrator...

1008
01:23:28,518 --> 01:23:30,925
...pushed out his red yabzick
a mile and a half...

1009
01:23:31,187 --> 01:23:34,021
... to lick the grahzny,
vonny boots.

1010
01:23:34,814 --> 01:23:35,810
And again!

1011
01:23:36,065 --> 01:23:38,520
The horrible killing sickness
had whooshed up...

1012
01:23:38,775 --> 01:23:40,399
...and turned the Joy of battle...

1013
01:23:41,194 --> 01:23:43,814
...into a feeling
I was going to snuff it.

1014
01:23:44,071 --> 01:23:45,351
And again.

1015
01:23:45,863 --> 01:23:47,855
Nice and cIean.

1016
01:23:50,491 --> 01:23:51,654
Thank you very much.

1017
01:23:51,909 --> 01:23:53,735
That wiII do very weII.

1018
01:23:57,955 --> 01:24:00,243
Thank you very much,
Iadies and gentIemen.

1019
01:25:10,670 --> 01:25:12,377
She came towards me...

1020
01:25:12,630 --> 01:25:16,377
... with the light, like it was the
light light of heavenly grace.

1021
01:25:16,632 --> 01:25:18,838
And the thing that flashed
in me gulliver...

1022
01:25:19,092 --> 01:25:21,713
... was that I'd like to have her
there on the floor...

1023
01:25:21,969 --> 01:25:25,171
... with the old in-out,
real savage.

1024
01:25:41,274 --> 01:25:43,645
But quick as a shot
came the sickness.

1025
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:46,438
Like a detective who 'd been
watching around the corner...

1026
01:25:47,236 --> 01:25:49,987
...and now followed
to make his arrest.

1027
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:03,945
Enough!

1028
01:26:04,289 --> 01:26:05,913
Thank you very much.

1029
01:26:06,165 --> 01:26:07,908
Thank you, my dear.

1030
01:26:29,764 --> 01:26:32,433
Not feeIing too bad now, are you?

1031
01:26:32,850 --> 01:26:35,091
No, sir.
I feeI reaIIy great, sir.

1032
01:26:35,351 --> 01:26:37,260
-Good.
-Was it aII right, sir?

1033
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:38,349
Did I do weII?

1034
01:26:38,604 --> 01:26:41,936
Fine, my boy.
AbsoIuteIy fine.

1035
01:26:42,189 --> 01:26:43,434
You see, Iadies and gentIemen. . .

1036
01:26:43,690 --> 01:26:46,145
. . .our subject is impeIIed
towards the good. . .

1037
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:50,064
. . .by paradoxicaIIy
being impeIIed towards eviI.

1038
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:52,027
The intention to act vioIentIy. . .

1039
01:26:52,279 --> 01:26:55,647
. . .is accompanied by strong
feeIings of physicaI distress.

1040
01:26:55,907 --> 01:26:58,611
To counter these,
the subject has to switch. . .

1041
01:26:58,867 --> 01:27:01,820
. . .to a diametricaIIy
opposed attitude.

1042
01:27:02,495 --> 01:27:03,869
Any questions?

1043
01:27:04,121 --> 01:27:05,531
Choice!

1044
01:27:08,999 --> 01:27:12,497
The boy has no reaI choice, has he?

1045
01:27:12,751 --> 01:27:14,293
SeIf-interest.

1046
01:27:14,544 --> 01:27:16,417
The fear of physicaI pain. . .

1047
01:27:16,671 --> 01:27:21,212
. . .drove him to that
grotesque act of seIf-abasement.

1048
01:27:21,924 --> 01:27:24,000
Its insincerity
was cIearIy to be seen.

1049
01:27:24,259 --> 01:27:26,132
He ceases to be a wrongdoer.

1050
01:27:26,385 --> 01:27:30,962
He ceases aIso to be
a creature capabIe of moraI choice.

1051
01:27:31,222 --> 01:27:33,547
Padre, these are subtIeties.

1052
01:27:33,807 --> 01:27:36,926
We're not concerned with motives,
with the higher ethics.

1053
01:27:37,184 --> 01:27:40,848
We are concerned onIy
with cutting down crime.

1054
01:27:43,188 --> 01:27:47,765
And with reIieving the ghastIy
congestion in our prisons.

1055
01:27:48,358 --> 01:27:50,813
He wiII be your true Christian. . .

1056
01:27:51,069 --> 01:27:53,144
. . .ready to turn the other cheek.

1057
01:27:53,403 --> 01:27:56,403
Ready to be crucified,
rather than crucify.

1058
01:27:56,656 --> 01:28:00,782
Sick to the very heart at the
thought even of kiIIing a fIy.

1059
01:28:01,034 --> 01:28:02,362
RecIamation.

1060
01:28:02,618 --> 01:28:04,859
Joy before the angeIs of God.

1061
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:08,238
The point is that it works!

1062
01:28:12,625 --> 01:28:15,957
And the very next day,
your friend and humble narrator...

1063
01:28:16,210 --> 01:28:18,249
... was a free man.

1064
01:28:56,654 --> 01:28:58,064
Son!

1065
01:28:59,656 --> 01:29:01,944
Hi, hi, hi there, my Pee and Em.

1066
01:29:03,283 --> 01:29:04,528
Mum.

1067
01:29:06,369 --> 01:29:08,693
How are you, Iove?
Nice to see you.

1068
01:29:10,372 --> 01:29:12,696
-Dad.
-Lad. What a surprise.

1069
01:29:12,957 --> 01:29:15,032
-Good to see you.
-Keeping fit?

1070
01:29:15,792 --> 01:29:17,036
How are you, then?

1071
01:29:17,293 --> 01:29:19,415
I'm fine, fine.

1072
01:29:19,669 --> 01:29:21,626
Keeping out of troubIe, you know.

1073
01:29:24,381 --> 01:29:26,088
I'm back!

1074
01:29:28,842 --> 01:29:29,838
Good to see you.

1075
01:29:30,093 --> 01:29:33,212
Why didn't you Iet us know
what was happening?

1076
01:29:33,595 --> 01:29:36,714
I wanted it to be, Iike,
a big surprise for you and Pee.

1077
01:29:37,014 --> 01:29:39,884
It's a surprise, aII right.
A bit bewiIdering too.

1078
01:29:40,141 --> 01:29:42,976
We've onIy just read about it
in morning papers.

1079
01:29:43,227 --> 01:29:45,018
You shouId have Iet us know, Iad.

1080
01:29:45,687 --> 01:29:49,600
Not that we're not very pIeased
to see you again, and aII. . .

1081
01:29:49,856 --> 01:29:51,350
. . .cured too, eh?

1082
01:29:51,607 --> 01:29:53,683
That's right.
They did a great job on me.

1083
01:29:53,942 --> 01:29:56,563
I'm compIeteIy reformed.

1084
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:01,987
StiII the same oId pIace, then?

1085
01:30:14,498 --> 01:30:17,332
There's a strange feIIow
sitting on the sofa. . .

1086
01:30:17,583 --> 01:30:20,702
. . .munchy-wunching
Iomticks of toast.

1087
01:30:23,712 --> 01:30:25,455
That's Joe.

1088
01:30:27,381 --> 01:30:29,338
He Iives here now.

1089
01:30:29,633 --> 01:30:30,961
The Iodger.

1090
01:30:31,217 --> 01:30:32,794
That's what he is.

1091
01:30:33,218 --> 01:30:35,210
He rents your room.

1092
01:30:45,894 --> 01:30:47,352
How do you do, Joe?

1093
01:30:47,603 --> 01:30:49,642
Find the room comfortabIe, do you?

1094
01:30:49,896 --> 01:30:51,853
No compIaints?

1095
01:30:54,941 --> 01:30:56,767
I've heard about you.

1096
01:30:57,860 --> 01:30:59,603
I know what you've done.

1097
01:31:03,947 --> 01:31:07,611
Breaking the hearts of your
poor, grieving parents.

1098
01:31:08,617 --> 01:31:10,360
So you're back, eh?

1099
01:31:10,618 --> 01:31:15,243
Back to make Iife a misery for
your IoveIy parents once more?

1100
01:31:15,538 --> 01:31:17,032
Over my dead corpse, you wiII.

1101
01:31:17,290 --> 01:31:20,574
Because, you see, they've Iet me
be more Iike a son to them. . .

1102
01:31:20,834 --> 01:31:22,790
. . .than Iike a Iodger.

1103
01:31:24,419 --> 01:31:26,956
Don't go fighting here, boys.

1104
01:31:32,842 --> 01:31:34,668
Do put your hand
over your mouth, pIease.

1105
01:31:34,968 --> 01:31:36,166
It's bIoody revoIting.

1106
01:31:41,722 --> 01:31:43,300
Are you aII right?

1107
01:31:44,474 --> 01:31:46,134
It's the treatment.

1108
01:31:46,392 --> 01:31:49,013
It's disgusting.
Enough to put you off your food.

1109
01:31:49,269 --> 01:31:53,052
Leave him be, Joe.
It's the treatment.

1110
01:31:55,148 --> 01:31:57,934
Do you think we ought
to do something?

1111
01:31:59,026 --> 01:32:02,358
WouId you Iike me to make you
a nice cup of tea, son?

1112
01:32:13,118 --> 01:32:16,202
What have you done
with aII me own personaI things?

1113
01:32:20,498 --> 01:32:23,249
That was aII. . .

1114
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:25,160
. . .took away, son.

1115
01:32:25,752 --> 01:32:27,543
By the poIice.

1116
01:32:27,962 --> 01:32:29,870
New reguIation, see. . .

1117
01:32:30,130 --> 01:32:33,165
. . .about compensation
for the victims.

1118
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:37,508
What about BasiI?

1119
01:32:40,512 --> 01:32:42,255
Where is my snake?

1120
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:53,717
He met with. . .

1121
01:32:53,979 --> 01:32:55,770
. . .Iike, an accident.

1122
01:32:59,733 --> 01:33:01,191
He passed away.

1123
01:33:06,529 --> 01:33:08,651
What's going to happen to me, then?

1124
01:33:10,907 --> 01:33:12,105
I mean. . .

1125
01:33:13,242 --> 01:33:14,700
. . .that's my room he's in.

1126
01:33:14,951 --> 01:33:16,824
There's no denying that.

1127
01:33:17,870 --> 01:33:20,442
This is my home aIso.

1128
01:33:22,373 --> 01:33:25,823
What suggestions have you,
my Pee and Em, to make?

1129
01:33:31,754 --> 01:33:34,327
AII this needs thinking about, son.

1130
01:33:35,590 --> 01:33:38,424
We can't very weII
just kick Joe out.

1131
01:33:38,675 --> 01:33:40,502
Not just Iike that, can we?

1132
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:41,791
I mean. . .

1133
01:33:42,053 --> 01:33:44,009
. . .Joe's here doing a job.

1134
01:33:44,263 --> 01:33:46,551
A contract it is.
Two years.

1135
01:33:46,806 --> 01:33:50,505
We made, Iike, an arrangement.
Didn't we, Joe?

1136
01:33:52,268 --> 01:33:54,224
You see, son. . .

1137
01:33:55,562 --> 01:33:59,095
. . .Joe's paid next month's
rent aIready. . .

1138
01:34:00,648 --> 01:34:03,483
. . .so whatever we may do in
the future, we can't just say. . .

1139
01:34:03,734 --> 01:34:06,734
. . .to Joe to get out, now can we?

1140
01:34:07,153 --> 01:34:09,026
No, but it's much more than that.

1141
01:34:09,905 --> 01:34:12,311
I mean, I've got you two
to think of. . .

1142
01:34:12,573 --> 01:34:15,443
. . .who've been Iike
a father and mother to me.

1143
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:18,653
It wouIdn't be right for me
to go off and Ieave you two. . .

1144
01:34:18,911 --> 01:34:21,827
. . .to the tender mercies
of this young monster. . .

1145
01:34:22,079 --> 01:34:25,328
. . .who's been Iike
no reaI son at aII.

1146
01:34:25,957 --> 01:34:28,281
Look, he's weeping now.

1147
01:34:28,542 --> 01:34:31,495
But that's aII his craft
and artfuIness.

1148
01:34:31,836 --> 01:34:34,587
Let him go and find
a room somewhere eIse.

1149
01:34:34,838 --> 01:34:39,130
Let him Iearn the errors
of his way, and that a bad boy. . .

1150
01:34:39,383 --> 01:34:42,833
. . .doesn't deserve such a good
mum and dad as he's had.

1151
01:34:48,555 --> 01:34:49,835
AII right.

1152
01:34:50,932 --> 01:34:52,805
I know how things are now.

1153
01:34:54,268 --> 01:34:56,888
I've suffered and I've suffered. . .

1154
01:34:57,144 --> 01:34:59,101
. . .and I've suffered.

1155
01:34:59,813 --> 01:35:03,015
And everybody wants me
to go on suffering.

1156
01:35:04,983 --> 01:35:07,141
You've made others suffer.

1157
01:35:07,652 --> 01:35:10,770
It's onIy right
that you shouId suffer proper.

1158
01:35:11,738 --> 01:35:13,397
I've been toId
everything you've done. . .

1159
01:35:13,656 --> 01:35:15,612
. . .sitting around the famiIy tabIe.

1160
01:35:15,865 --> 01:35:18,949
And pretty shocking
it was to Iisten to.

1161
01:35:19,868 --> 01:35:23,034
It made me reaI sick,
a Iot of it did.

1162
01:35:24,996 --> 01:35:28,578
Now Iook what you've gone
and done to your mother.

1163
01:35:28,832 --> 01:35:30,456
Come on. It's aII right now.

1164
01:35:43,384 --> 01:35:44,546
Right!

1165
01:35:45,302 --> 01:35:47,009
I'm Ieaving now.

1166
01:35:47,261 --> 01:35:49,384
You won't ever viddy me no more.

1167
01:35:49,638 --> 01:35:51,345
I'II make me own way.

1168
01:35:51,806 --> 01:35:55,470
Thank you very much. Let it Iie
heavy on your consciences.

1169
01:35:56,809 --> 01:35:59,762
Now don't take it Iike that, son.

1170
01:37:02,019 --> 01:37:04,972
Can you spare some cutter,
me brother?

1171
01:37:06,773 --> 01:37:09,891
Can you spare some cutter,
me brother?

1172
01:37:13,569 --> 01:37:16,652
Can you spare some cutter,
me brother?

1173
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:39,418
Thanks, brother.

1174
01:37:57,348 --> 01:37:59,174
Jamey Mack!

1175
01:37:59,641 --> 01:38:01,099
May the hokey fIy!

1176
01:38:01,434 --> 01:38:04,968
Mother of God and aII the bIessed
saints in heaven preserve us!

1177
01:38:06,688 --> 01:38:08,763
I never forget a face, me God!

1178
01:38:09,022 --> 01:38:10,350
I never forget any face.

1179
01:38:10,607 --> 01:38:13,393
Leave me aIone, brother.
I've never seen you before!

1180
01:38:13,651 --> 01:38:17,101
This is the poisonous young swine
that near done me in.

1181
01:38:17,361 --> 01:38:18,524
Him and his friends.

1182
01:38:18,779 --> 01:38:21,649
They beat me and kicked me
and punched me.

1183
01:38:21,906 --> 01:38:23,448
Stop him! Stop him!

1184
01:38:23,699 --> 01:38:27,612
They Iaughed at me bIood
and me moans, this murderous dog!

1185
01:38:27,868 --> 01:38:31,236
Then there was like
a sea of dirty, smelly old men...

1186
01:38:31,496 --> 01:38:33,571
... trying to get at
your humble narrator...

1187
01:38:33,831 --> 01:38:37,495
... with their feeble rookers
and horny old claws.

1188
01:38:37,750 --> 01:38:40,536
It was old age
having a go at youth.

1189
01:38:41,252 --> 01:38:44,501
And I daren 't do a single
solitary thing, O my brothers.

1190
01:38:44,796 --> 01:38:46,788
It being better
to be hit at like that...

1191
01:38:47,048 --> 01:38:49,620
... than want to sick
and feel that horrible pain.

1192
01:38:49,883 --> 01:38:51,293
AII right, aII right!

1193
01:38:51,551 --> 01:38:52,416
Stop it now!

1194
01:38:52,677 --> 01:38:56,044
Come on. Stop breaking the
state's peace, you naughty boys!

1195
01:38:56,304 --> 01:38:59,138
Back away! Go away with you!

1196
01:38:59,389 --> 01:39:01,677
What's your troubIe, sir?

1197
01:39:09,313 --> 01:39:10,688
WeII!

1198
01:39:11,356 --> 01:39:13,810
WeII, weII, weII!

1199
01:39:17,735 --> 01:39:20,225
If it isn't IittIe AIex.

1200
01:39:20,487 --> 01:39:21,862
Long time no viddy, droog.

1201
01:39:22,113 --> 01:39:23,571
How goes?

1202
01:39:23,822 --> 01:39:25,067
It's impossibIe.

1203
01:39:25,323 --> 01:39:26,521
I don't beIieve it.

1204
01:39:26,783 --> 01:39:28,656
Evidence of the oId gIazzies.

1205
01:39:28,909 --> 01:39:30,700
Nothing up our sIeeves.

1206
01:39:30,952 --> 01:39:32,991
No magic, IittIe AIex.

1207
01:39:33,245 --> 01:39:36,696
A job for two
who are now of job age.

1208
01:39:37,081 --> 01:39:38,492
The poIice.

1209
01:39:54,218 --> 01:39:55,415
Come on, AIex.

1210
01:39:55,677 --> 01:39:57,219
Come for waIking.

1211
01:40:08,811 --> 01:40:11,218
Come, come, come,
my IittIe droogies.

1212
01:40:11,479 --> 01:40:13,021
I just don't get this at aII.

1213
01:40:13,272 --> 01:40:15,430
The oId days are dead and gone.

1214
01:40:15,690 --> 01:40:18,525
For what I did in the past,
I've been punished.

1215
01:40:18,817 --> 01:40:20,477
I've been cured.

1216
01:40:20,735 --> 01:40:21,933
That was read out to us.

1217
01:40:22,195 --> 01:40:24,021
The inspector read it
aII out to us.

1218
01:40:24,279 --> 01:40:26,948
He said it was a very good way.

1219
01:40:27,198 --> 01:40:28,443
But what is aII this?

1220
01:40:28,741 --> 01:40:31,231
It was them
that went for me, brothers.

1221
01:40:31,493 --> 01:40:34,161
You're not on their side,
and can't be.

1222
01:40:34,745 --> 01:40:36,902
You can't be, Dim.

1223
01:40:37,163 --> 01:40:39,831
It was someone we fiIIied with
back in the oId days. . .

1224
01:40:40,082 --> 01:40:43,532
. . .trying to get his own revenge
after aII this time. Remember?

1225
01:40:43,792 --> 01:40:45,203
A Iong time is right.

1226
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:47,701
I don't remember them days
too horrorshow.

1227
01:40:47,962 --> 01:40:50,037
And don't caII me Dim
no more, either.

1228
01:40:50,297 --> 01:40:52,372
Officer, caII me.

1229
01:40:52,715 --> 01:40:56,165
Enough is remembered, though,
IittIe AIex.

1230
01:40:56,801 --> 01:40:59,884
And this is to make sure
you stay cured.

1231
01:41:55,799 --> 01:41:56,913
That's enough.

1232
01:41:57,175 --> 01:41:59,795
A bit more. He's stiII kicking.

1233
01:42:18,647 --> 01:42:20,474
Cured, are you?

1234
01:42:22,150 --> 01:42:25,980
Be viddying you some more
sometime, droogie.

1235
01:42:41,246 --> 01:42:45,242
Where was I to go,
who had no home and no money?

1236
01:42:45,499 --> 01:42:47,704
I cried for meself.

1237
01:42:48,042 --> 01:42:50,828
Home, home, home.

1238
01:42:51,086 --> 01:42:52,959
It was home I was wanting.

1239
01:42:53,212 --> 01:42:56,212
And it was home
I came to, brothers...

1240
01:42:56,464 --> 01:42:59,085
...not realizing,
in the state I was in...

1241
01:42:59,341 --> 01:43:02,341
... where I was
and had been before.

1242
01:43:50,542 --> 01:43:52,534
Who on earth couId that be?

1243
01:44:08,095 --> 01:44:09,755
I'II see who it is.

1244
01:44:21,312 --> 01:44:22,890
Yes, what is it?

1245
01:44:31,569 --> 01:44:32,767
PIease. . . .

1246
01:44:49,623 --> 01:44:52,955
Frank, I think this young man
needs some heIp.

1247
01:44:57,670 --> 01:44:59,080
My God!

1248
01:45:00,047 --> 01:45:02,288
What's happened to you, my boy?

1249
01:45:04,758 --> 01:45:08,422
And would you believe it,
O my brothers and only friends...

1250
01:45:08,677 --> 01:45:10,919
... there was your
faithful narrator...

1251
01:45:11,179 --> 01:45:13,634
...being held helpless
like a babe in arms...

1252
01:45:13,889 --> 01:45:16,261
...and suddenly realizing
where he was...

1253
01:45:16,516 --> 01:45:19,931
...and why ''home'' on the gate
had looked so familiar.

1254
01:45:20,185 --> 01:45:21,928
But I knew I was safe.

1255
01:45:22,186 --> 01:45:24,225
I knew he would not remember me.

1256
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,222
For in those carefree days...

1257
01:45:26,481 --> 01:45:28,354
...I and my so-called droogs...

1258
01:45:28,607 --> 01:45:32,106
... wore our maskies, which were
like real horrorshow disguises.

1259
01:45:33,402 --> 01:45:34,600
PoIice.

1260
01:45:38,281 --> 01:45:40,438
GhastIy, horribIe poIice. . .

1261
01:45:42,450 --> 01:45:44,027
. . .they beat me up, sir.

1262
01:45:48,329 --> 01:45:50,700
The poIice beat me up.

1263
01:45:52,790 --> 01:45:54,450
I know you!

1264
01:45:58,669 --> 01:46:00,791
Isn't it your picture
in the newspapers?

1265
01:46:01,046 --> 01:46:03,251
Didn't I see you
on the video this morning?

1266
01:46:03,506 --> 01:46:06,838
Are you not the poor victim
of this horribIe new technique?

1267
01:46:07,133 --> 01:46:08,378
Yes, sir.

1268
01:46:08,843 --> 01:46:12,045
That's exactIy who I am and
what I am, sir. A victim.

1269
01:46:12,303 --> 01:46:15,422
Then, by God, you've been
sent here by providence!

1270
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:18,764
Tortured in prison, then
tortured by the poIice.

1271
01:46:19,016 --> 01:46:23,511
My heart goes out to you.
You're not the first to come here.

1272
01:46:23,769 --> 01:46:26,639
The poIice Iike to bring
their victims to this viIIage.

1273
01:46:26,896 --> 01:46:28,271
But it's providentiaI that you. . .

1274
01:46:28,522 --> 01:46:32,056
. . .who are aIso another kind
of victim, shouId come here.

1275
01:46:34,026 --> 01:46:37,061
But you're coId and shivering.

1276
01:46:37,570 --> 01:46:38,945
JuIian. . .

1277
01:46:39,196 --> 01:46:41,437
. . .draw a bath for this young man.

1278
01:46:41,698 --> 01:46:43,026
CertainIy, Frank.

1279
01:46:43,407 --> 01:46:45,031
Thank you very much.

1280
01:46:45,284 --> 01:46:46,908
God bIess you.

1281
01:47:41,821 --> 01:47:44,109
He can be the most potent
weapon imaginabIe. . .

1282
01:47:44,365 --> 01:47:47,530
. . .to ensure the government
is not returned in the eIection.

1283
01:47:47,784 --> 01:47:49,574
The government's big boast, sir. . .

1284
01:47:49,827 --> 01:47:52,530
. . .is the way they have
deaIt with crime:

1285
01:47:52,787 --> 01:47:54,613
Recruiting young roughs
into the poIice. . .

1286
01:47:54,872 --> 01:47:57,907
. . .proposing wiII-sapping
techniques of conditioning.

1287
01:47:58,165 --> 01:48:00,407
We've seen it before
in other countries.

1288
01:48:00,667 --> 01:48:02,125
The thin end of the wedge.

1289
01:48:02,377 --> 01:48:06,455
Before we know it, we'II have the
fuII apparatus of totaIitarianism.

1290
01:48:10,507 --> 01:48:14,883
This young boy is a Iiving witness
to these diaboIicaI proposaIs.

1291
01:48:15,135 --> 01:48:18,882
The peopIe, the common peopIe,
must know, must see.

1292
01:48:19,138 --> 01:48:23,514
There are traditions of Iiberty to
defend. That tradition is aII.

1293
01:48:23,766 --> 01:48:25,722
The common peopIe
wiII Iet it go, yes.

1294
01:48:25,976 --> 01:48:28,098
They'II seII Iiberty
for a quieter Iife.

1295
01:48:28,352 --> 01:48:29,894
That is why they must be Ied.

1296
01:48:30,145 --> 01:48:32,220
Driven. Pushed.

1297
01:48:37,275 --> 01:48:38,519
Fine.

1298
01:48:39,568 --> 01:48:41,228
Thank you very much, sir.

1299
01:48:43,279 --> 01:48:44,821
He'II be here.

1300
01:48:48,032 --> 01:48:51,317
I'm singing in the rain

1301
01:48:52,118 --> 01:48:55,071
Just singing in the rain

1302
01:48:55,912 --> 01:48:59,078
What a glorious feeling

1303
01:48:59,456 --> 01:49:02,789
I'm hap-hap-happy again

1304
01:49:03,417 --> 01:49:06,536
I'm laughing at clouds

1305
01:49:07,337 --> 01:49:09,874
So dark up above

1306
01:49:10,881 --> 01:49:13,335
The sun 's in my heart

1307
01:49:14,175 --> 01:49:18,123
I'm ready for love

1308
01:49:19,053 --> 01:49:21,804
Let the stormy clouds chase

1309
01:49:22,430 --> 01:49:25,264
Everyone from the place

1310
01:49:26,725 --> 01:49:31,717
Come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face

1311
01:49:32,353 --> 01:49:35,353
I'll walk down the lane

1312
01:50:09,545 --> 01:50:11,003
Good evening, sir.

1313
01:50:14,965 --> 01:50:16,507
Good evening.

1314
01:50:17,050 --> 01:50:19,884
It was very kind of you
to Ieave this out for me.

1315
01:50:20,135 --> 01:50:22,542
There was no one around,
so I started.

1316
01:50:22,804 --> 01:50:24,630
Hope that's aII right, sir.

1317
01:50:28,141 --> 01:50:29,848
Of course.

1318
01:51:00,704 --> 01:51:03,075
Food aII right?

1319
01:51:08,793 --> 01:51:10,500
Great, sir. Great.

1320
01:51:13,462 --> 01:51:15,704
Try the wine.

1321
01:51:22,093 --> 01:51:23,373
Thank you, sir.

1322
01:51:26,054 --> 01:51:27,299
Cheers.

1323
01:51:29,348 --> 01:51:30,546
Happy days.

1324
01:51:41,064 --> 01:51:43,352
Won't you join me?

1325
01:51:44,108 --> 01:51:46,314
My heaIth doesn't aIIow it.

1326
01:51:47,152 --> 01:51:48,480
No, thank you.

1327
01:51:54,448 --> 01:51:56,903

Very good brand.

Very good. . .

SmeIIs nice too.

1334

Very nice IittIe number.

1335
01:52:36,976 --> 01:52:38,304
Here's to it.

1336
01:52:47,025 --> 01:52:49,562
Very refreshing, sir.
Very refreshing.

1337

I'm pIeased you
appreciate good wine.

Have another gIass.

My wife. . .

1340
01:53:11,708 --> 01:53:15,206
. . .used to do everything for me
and Ieave me to my writing.

1341
01:53:18,129 --> 01:53:19,788
Your wife? Is she away?

1342
01:53:20,172 --> 01:53:22,496
She's dead!

1343
01:53:26,635 --> 01:53:28,461
I'm sorry to hear about that.

1344
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:31,091
She was very badIy raped, you see.

1345
01:53:31,346 --> 01:53:33,753
We were assauIted by
vicious young hoodIums. . .

1346
01:53:34,015 --> 01:53:36,339
. . .in this very room
you're sitting in now.

1347
01:53:36,600 --> 01:53:41,343
I was Ieft a heIpIess crippIe,
but for her the agony was too great.

1348
01:53:41,686 --> 01:53:43,513
The doctors said
it was pneumonia. . .

1349
01:53:43,771 --> 01:53:46,605
. . .because it happened Iater,
during a fIu epidemic.

1350
01:53:46,856 --> 01:53:51,102
The doctors toId me it was
pneumonia, but I knew what it was.

1351
01:53:51,359 --> 01:53:55,687
A victim of the modern age.
Poor, poor girI!

1352
01:53:59,698 --> 01:54:01,275
And now you.

1353
01:54:01,866 --> 01:54:04,902
Another victim of the modern age.

1354
01:54:05,202 --> 01:54:07,159
But you can be heIped.

1355
01:54:08,162 --> 01:54:11,613
I phoned some friends whiIe
you were having your bath.

1356
01:54:11,873 --> 01:54:12,703
Some. . .

1357
01:54:12,957 --> 01:54:14,036
. . .friends?

1358
01:54:14,291 --> 01:54:15,833
They want to heIp you.

1359
01:54:16,084 --> 01:54:18,325
-HeIp me?
-HeIp you.

1360
01:54:18,586 --> 01:54:22,084
-Who are they?
-Very, very important peopIe.

1361
01:54:22,338 --> 01:54:24,710
And they're interested in you.

1362
01:54:30,177 --> 01:54:32,335
This'II be these peopIe now.

1363
01:54:32,595 --> 01:54:36,010
I don't want to troubIe you
any further. I shouId be Ieaving.

1364
01:54:37,098 --> 01:54:39,055
No troubIe at aII.

1365
01:54:39,767 --> 01:54:40,964
Here.

1366
01:54:41,226 --> 01:54:43,135
Let me fiII your gIass.

1367
01:55:08,828 --> 01:55:10,571
So this is the young man.

1368
01:55:11,955 --> 01:55:13,413
How do you do, sir?

1369
01:55:13,789 --> 01:55:16,410
Missus.
I'm very pIeased to meet you.

1370
01:55:16,791 --> 01:55:19,282
I hope you forgive us for coming
at this hour. . .

1371
01:55:19,543 --> 01:55:21,416
. . .but we heard you
were in troubIe. . .

1372
01:55:21,670 --> 01:55:23,911
. . .and so we came over to see
if we couId heIp.

1373
01:55:24,171 --> 01:55:26,412
Very kind of you, sir.
Thank you very much.

1374
01:55:26,673 --> 01:55:28,914
I understand you had a rather. . .

1375
01:55:29,175 --> 01:55:30,419
. . .unfortunate. . .

1376
01:55:30,676 --> 01:55:32,169
. . .encounter. . .

1377
01:55:32,427 --> 01:55:34,170
. . .with the poIice tonight.

1378
01:55:34,428 --> 01:55:36,504
Yes, I suppose
you couId caII it that.

1379
01:55:36,763 --> 01:55:38,091
How are you feeIing now?

1380
01:55:38,347 --> 01:55:39,592
Much better, thank you.

1381
01:55:39,848 --> 01:55:42,220
FeeI Iike taIking,
answering a few questions?

1382
01:55:42,475 --> 01:55:43,803
Fine, sir. Fine.

1383
01:55:44,643 --> 01:55:47,312
As I said, we've heard about you.

1384
01:55:47,812 --> 01:55:50,433
We are interested in your case.

1385
01:55:50,689 --> 01:55:53,559
-We want to heIp you.
-Thank you very much.

1386
01:55:53,858 --> 01:55:56,977
ShaII we get down to it?

1387
01:55:57,235 --> 01:55:59,026
Fine. Fine, sir.

1388
01:56:04,323 --> 01:56:07,074
The newspapers mentioned. . .

1389
01:56:07,325 --> 01:56:11,618
. . .in addition to being conditioned
against acts of sex and vioIence. . .

1390
01:56:11,870 --> 01:56:15,238
. . .you've inadvertentIy been
conditioned against music.

1391
01:56:16,206 --> 01:56:19,289
I think that was something
that they didn't pIan for.

1392
01:56:19,625 --> 01:56:21,534
You see, missus. . .

1393
01:56:21,793 --> 01:56:25,291
. . .I'm very fond of music.
EspeciaIIy Beethoven.

1394
01:56:26,421 --> 01:56:28,378
Ludwig van Beethoven.

1395
01:56:28,631 --> 01:56:30,919
-B-E--
-It's aII right, thank you.

1396
01:56:31,466 --> 01:56:35,545
And it just so happened that
whiIe they were showing me. . .

1397
01:56:35,802 --> 01:56:39,715
. . .a particuIarIy bad fiIm
of, Iike, a concentration camp. . .

1398
01:56:39,972 --> 01:56:43,506
. . .the background music
was pIaying Beethoven.

1399
01:56:43,766 --> 01:56:46,517
So now you have
the same reaction to music. . .

1400
01:56:46,768 --> 01:56:48,511
. . .as you do to sex and vioIence?

1401
01:56:48,769 --> 01:56:53,062
No, missus. You see, it's not
aII music. It's just the Ninth.

1402
01:56:53,314 --> 01:56:55,057
You mean Beethoven's Ninth Symphony?

1403
01:56:55,315 --> 01:56:58,351
That's right. I can't Iisten
to the Ninth anymore at aII.

1404
01:56:58,609 --> 01:57:02,060
When I hear the Ninth, I get, Iike. . .

1405
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:03,944
. . .this funny feeIing.

1406
01:57:04,989 --> 01:57:09,281
And then aII I can think about
is, Iike, trying to snuff it.

1407
01:57:09,533 --> 01:57:13,945
-I beg your pardon?
-Snuff it. Death, I mean.

1408
01:57:14,203 --> 01:57:16,776
I just want to die peacefuIIy. . .

1409
01:57:17,247 --> 01:57:19,571
. . .Iike, with no pain.

1410
01:57:20,332 --> 01:57:22,205
Do you feeI that way now?

1411
01:57:23,376 --> 01:57:25,332
No, sir, not exactIy.

1412
01:57:25,586 --> 01:57:26,830
I stiII feeI. . .

1413
01:57:27,087 --> 01:57:28,331
. . .very miserabIe.

1414
01:57:28,588 --> 01:57:31,125
Very much down in spirits.

1415
01:57:31,631 --> 01:57:32,959
Do you stiII feeI. . .

1416
01:57:33,216 --> 01:57:34,709
. . .suicidaI?

1417
01:57:37,969 --> 01:57:39,712
Put it this way:

1418
01:57:40,012 --> 01:57:42,846
I feeI very Iow in myseIf.

1419
01:57:43,681 --> 01:57:46,006
I can't see much in the future.

1420
01:57:46,266 --> 01:57:50,725
I feeI that any second, something
terribIe is going to happen to me.

1421
01:58:03,945 --> 01:58:05,604
WeII done, Frank.

1422
01:58:11,658 --> 01:58:13,449
Get the car, wouId you, pIease?

1423
01:58:34,048 --> 01:58:35,423
I woke up...

1424
01:58:40,969 --> 01:58:44,717
... the pain and sickness
all over me like an animal.

1425
01:58:52,769 --> 01:58:55,603
Then I realized what it was.

1426
01:58:56,897 --> 01:58:59,683
The music coming up
from the floor...

1427
01:58:59,940 --> 01:59:03,106
... was our old friend,
Ludwig van...

1428
01:59:03,359 --> 01:59:06,028
...and the dreaded Ninth Symphony.

1429
01:59:13,950 --> 01:59:15,324
Let me out!

1430
01:59:15,576 --> 01:59:17,319
Open the door!

1431
01:59:18,036 --> 01:59:20,193
Come on, open the door!

1432
01:59:22,747 --> 01:59:24,027
Turn it off!

1433
01:59:24,290 --> 01:59:26,033
Turn it off!

1434
01:59:32,962 --> 01:59:33,875
Stop it!

1435
02:00:22,120 --> 02:00:23,662
Turn it off!

1436
02:00:25,080 --> 02:00:26,029
PIease!

1437
02:00:26,290 --> 02:00:28,447
Turn it off!

1438
02:00:42,384 --> 02:00:45,253
Suddenly, I viddied
what I had to do...

1439
02:00:45,511 --> 02:00:47,835
...and what I had wanted to do.

1440
02:00:48,263 --> 02:00:50,669
And that was to do myself in.

1441
02:00:51,098 --> 02:00:52,473
To snuff it.

1442
02:00:52,807 --> 02:00:56,175
To blast off forever,
out of this wicked, cruel world.

1443
02:00:57,769 --> 02:01:00,176
One moment of pain, perhaps...

1444
02:01:00,479 --> 02:01:02,270
...and then sleep.

1445
02:01:02,522 --> 02:01:05,012
Forever and ever...

1446
02:01:05,274 --> 02:01:06,602
...and ever.

1447
02:01:31,041 --> 02:01:32,832
I Jumped, O my brothers...

1448
02:01:33,084 --> 02:01:34,542
...and I fell hard.

1449
02:01:34,794 --> 02:01:37,082
But I did not snuff it.

1450
02:01:37,712 --> 02:01:39,289
If I had snuffed it...

1451
02:01:39,547 --> 02:01:42,831
...I would not be here
to tell what I told have.

1452
02:01:44,759 --> 02:01:49,384
I came back to life
after a long, black, black gap...

1453
02:01:49,637 --> 02:01:52,921
...of what might have been
a million years.

1454
02:02:21,658 --> 02:02:24,195
He's recovered
consciousness, Doctor.

1455
02:03:04,270 --> 02:03:05,764
HeIIo, Iad.

1456
02:03:06,021 --> 02:03:07,598
HeIIo, son.

1457
02:03:08,564 --> 02:03:10,023
How are you?

1458
02:03:11,150 --> 02:03:13,141
You feeIing better?

1459
02:03:17,612 --> 02:03:18,643
What. . .

1460
02:03:18,905 --> 02:03:19,936
. . .gives. . .

1461
02:03:21,406 --> 02:03:23,398
. . .O my Pee and Em?

1462
02:03:24,408 --> 02:03:25,950
What makes. . .

1463
02:03:26,743 --> 02:03:27,656
. . .you think. . .

1464
02:03:27,911 --> 02:03:30,365
. . .you are weIcome?

1465
02:03:33,289 --> 02:03:35,246
There, there, Mother.
It's aII right.

1466
02:03:35,499 --> 02:03:37,123
He doesn't mean it.

1467
02:03:39,585 --> 02:03:42,122
You were in the papers again, son.

1468
02:03:42,921 --> 02:03:44,462
It said. . .

1469
02:03:44,714 --> 02:03:47,464
. . .they had done
great wrong to you.

1470
02:03:48,341 --> 02:03:49,669
It said. . .

1471
02:03:49,925 --> 02:03:51,253
. . .how the government. . .

1472
02:03:51,510 --> 02:03:53,502
. . .drove you to try. . .

1473
02:03:53,761 --> 02:03:55,338
. . .and do yourseIf in.

1474
02:03:57,139 --> 02:03:59,427
And when you think about it, son. . .

1475
02:04:00,516 --> 02:04:03,136
. . .maybe it was our fauIt too. . .

1476
02:04:03,518 --> 02:04:04,762
. . .in a way.

1477
02:04:05,894 --> 02:04:07,803
Your home's your home. . .

1478
02:04:08,146 --> 02:04:10,636
. . .when aII's said and done, son.

1479
02:04:20,654 --> 02:04:23,144
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Doctor.

1480
02:04:32,120 --> 02:04:34,361
-How are you feeIing today?
-Fine.

1481
02:04:34,622 --> 02:04:35,736
Good. May I?

1482
02:04:36,165 --> 02:04:38,203
-I'm Dr. TayIor.
-Haven't seen you before.

1483
02:04:38,458 --> 02:04:39,738
I'm your psychiatrist.

1484
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:41,874
Psychiatrist!
Do I need one?

1485
02:04:42,127 --> 02:04:43,621
Just part of hospitaI routine.

1486
02:04:43,836 --> 02:04:45,994
Are we going to
taIk about me sex Iife?

1487
02:04:47,714 --> 02:04:49,706
I'm going to show you
some sIides. . .

1488
02:04:49,965 --> 02:04:52,800
. . .and you're going to teII me
what you think about them.

1489
02:04:53,718 --> 02:04:54,583
JoIIy good.

1490
02:04:56,720 --> 02:04:58,297
You know anything about dreams?

1491
02:04:58,721 --> 02:04:59,836
Something, yes.

1492
02:05:00,097 --> 02:05:01,840
-You know what they mean?
-Perhaps.

1493
02:05:02,057 --> 02:05:03,515
You concerned about something?

1494
02:05:03,766 --> 02:05:06,766
No, not concerned, reaIIy. . .

1495
02:05:07,018 --> 02:05:09,010
. . .but I've been having
this nasty dream.

1496
02:05:09,270 --> 02:05:10,728
Very nasty.

1497
02:05:10,979 --> 02:05:12,888
It's Iike. . .

1498
02:05:14,899 --> 02:05:17,056
. . .when I was aII smashed up,
you know. . .

1499
02:05:17,317 --> 02:05:19,356
. . .and haIf-awake
and unconscious-Iike. . .

1500
02:05:19,610 --> 02:05:21,732
. . .I kept having this dream.

1501
02:05:21,987 --> 02:05:24,856
AII these doctors were
pIaying around with me guIIiver.

1502
02:05:25,114 --> 02:05:27,189
You know, Iike the inside
of me brain.

1503
02:05:27,449 --> 02:05:30,318
I seem to have this dream
over and over again.

1504
02:05:30,576 --> 02:05:32,698
Do you think it means anything?

1505
02:05:33,620 --> 02:05:38,031
Patients with injuries Iike yours
often have dreams of this sort.

1506
02:05:38,289 --> 02:05:40,365
It's aII part
of the recovery process.

1507
02:05:41,625 --> 02:05:44,411
Now then, each of these sIides
needs a repIy. . .

1508
02:05:44,669 --> 02:05:46,661
. . .from one of the peopIe
in the picture.

1509
02:05:46,920 --> 02:05:50,122
You teII me what you think
the person wouId say. . .

1510
02:05:50,381 --> 02:05:51,246
. . .aII right?

1511
02:05:51,506 --> 02:05:52,917
Righty-right.

1512
02:05:54,925 --> 02:05:57,297
''Isn't the pIumage beautifuI?''

1513
02:05:58,553 --> 02:06:01,008
I just say what the
other person wouId say?

1514
02:06:05,182 --> 02:06:06,724
Don't think about it too Iong.

1515
02:06:06,975 --> 02:06:09,465
Say the first thing
that pops into your mind.

1516
02:06:12,145 --> 02:06:14,517
Cabbages. Knickers.

1517
02:06:15,689 --> 02:06:17,977
It's not got a beak.

1518
02:06:18,233 --> 02:06:19,513
Good.

1519
02:06:23,194 --> 02:06:27,107
''The boy you aIways quarreIed with
is seriousIy iII. ''

1520
02:06:28,073 --> 02:06:29,815
My mind is a bIank. . .

1521
02:06:30,866 --> 02:06:34,779
. . .and I'II smash your face
for you, yarbIockos.

1522
02:06:35,036 --> 02:06:36,031
Good.

1523
02:06:38,621 --> 02:06:40,697
''What do you want?''

1524
02:06:41,832 --> 02:06:45,200
No time for the oId in-out, Iove.
I've just come to read the meter.

1525
02:06:45,584 --> 02:06:46,959
Good.

1526
02:06:50,421 --> 02:06:53,919
''You soId me a crummy watch.
I want my money back. ''

1527
02:06:54,423 --> 02:06:57,626
You know what you can do with
that watch? Stick it up your ass!

1528
02:07:02,012 --> 02:07:04,716
''You can do whatever
you Iike with these. ''

1529
02:07:06,306 --> 02:07:08,049
Eggiwegs.

1530
02:07:08,600 --> 02:07:10,556
I wouId Iike. . .

1531
02:07:10,809 --> 02:07:12,089
. . .to smash them.

1532
02:07:12,936 --> 02:07:14,180
And pick them aII up. . .

1533
02:07:14,437 --> 02:07:16,061
. . .and throw--

1534
02:07:16,313 --> 02:07:17,771
Fucking heII!

1535
02:07:18,648 --> 02:07:20,972
There. That's aII there is to it.

1536
02:07:21,650 --> 02:07:23,144
Are you aII right?

1537
02:07:24,027 --> 02:07:25,354
Hope so.

1538
02:07:25,611 --> 02:07:28,646
Is that the end, then?
I was quite enjoying that.

1539
02:07:28,988 --> 02:07:30,268
Good. I'm gIad.

1540
02:07:30,573 --> 02:07:31,687
How many did I get right?

1541
02:07:31,948 --> 02:07:33,739
It's not that kind of a test.

1542
02:07:33,992 --> 02:07:37,324
But you seem weII on the way
to making a compIete recovery.

1543
02:07:37,952 --> 02:07:39,363
When do I get out, then?

1544
02:07:39,620 --> 02:07:42,193
I'm sure it won't be Iong now.

1545
02:07:43,623 --> 02:07:45,200
So I waited...

1546
02:07:45,457 --> 02:07:46,951
...and, O my brothers...

1547
02:07:47,334 --> 02:07:48,744
...I got a lot better...

1548
02:07:49,002 --> 02:07:52,251
...munching away at eggiwegs
and lomticks of toast...

1549
02:07:52,504 --> 02:07:54,911
...and lovely steakie-wakes.

1550
02:07:55,172 --> 02:07:56,631
And then one day...

1551
02:07:56,882 --> 02:08:01,044
... they said I was going to have
a very special visitor.

1552
02:08:06,472 --> 02:08:09,175
Just wait outside for a moment,
wouId you, Officer?

1553
02:08:12,267 --> 02:08:14,425
I'm afraid my change of scheduIe
has thrown you.

1554
02:08:14,685 --> 02:08:16,926
The patient's in the middIe
of supper.

1555
02:08:17,187 --> 02:08:20,021
That's quite aII right, Minister.
No troubIe at aII.

1556
02:08:21,482 --> 02:08:24,481
-Good evening, my boy.
-Hi there, my IittIe droogies.

1557
02:08:24,734 --> 02:08:26,524
How are you getting on, young man?

1558
02:08:26,902 --> 02:08:29,107
Great, sir. Just great.

1559
02:08:29,904 --> 02:08:31,445
Can I do anything more for you?

1560
02:08:31,697 --> 02:08:33,439
I don't think so, Sir LesIie.

1561
02:08:33,698 --> 02:08:36,366
Then I Ieave you to it.
Nurse!

1562
02:08:39,202 --> 02:08:42,451
You seem to have a whoIe ward
to yourseIf, my boy.

1563
02:08:42,704 --> 02:08:43,984
Yes, sir.

1564
02:08:44,539 --> 02:08:46,863
And a very IoneIy pIace
it is too. . .

1565
02:08:47,124 --> 02:08:49,495
. . .when I wake up in the night
with me pain.

1566
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:53,201
Anyway, good to see you
on the mend.

1567
02:08:53,461 --> 02:08:56,034
I kept in touch
with the hospitaI, of course.

1568
02:08:56,296 --> 02:08:58,123
And now I've come down
personaIIy. . .

1569
02:08:58,381 --> 02:08:59,958
. . .to see how you're getting aIong.

1570
02:09:00,424 --> 02:09:02,665
I've suffered the tortures
of the damned.

1571
02:09:02,926 --> 02:09:04,420
Tortures of the damned.

1572
02:09:04,677 --> 02:09:07,760
Yes, I can appreciate that
you've had an extremeIy--

1573
02:09:08,013 --> 02:09:10,716
Oh, Iook. Let me heIp you
with that, shaII I?

1574
02:09:12,933 --> 02:09:17,178
I can teII you that I, and the
government of which I'm a member. . .

1575
02:09:17,436 --> 02:09:21,349
. . .are deepIy sorry about this,
my boy. DeepIy sorry.

1576
02:09:21,605 --> 02:09:22,850
We tried to heIp you.

1577
02:09:23,106 --> 02:09:27,185
We foIIowed recommendations
that turned out to be wrong.

1578
02:09:27,567 --> 02:09:31,433
An inquiry wiII pIace the
responsibiIity where it beIongs.

1579
02:09:32,112 --> 02:09:35,314
We want you to regard us
as friends.

1580
02:09:35,573 --> 02:09:36,770
We put you right.

1581
02:09:37,240 --> 02:09:39,114
You're getting
the best of treatment.

1582
02:09:39,367 --> 02:09:41,608
We never wished you harm.

1583
02:09:41,910 --> 02:09:44,579
But there are some who did, and do.

1584
02:09:45,079 --> 02:09:47,747
And I think you know who those are.

1585
02:09:48,331 --> 02:09:52,114
There are certain peopIe who wanted
to use you for poIiticaI ends.

1586
02:09:52,375 --> 02:09:54,700
They wouId have been
gIad to have you dead. . .

1587
02:09:54,961 --> 02:09:58,126
. . .for they thought they couId then
bIame it on the government.

1588
02:09:58,713 --> 02:10:01,038
There is aIso a certain man. . .

1589
02:10:01,298 --> 02:10:03,788
. . .a writer of subversive
Iiterature. . .

1590
02:10:04,050 --> 02:10:06,125
. . .who has been howIing
for your bIood.

1591
02:10:06,385 --> 02:10:09,800
He's been mad with desire
to stick a knife into you.

1592
02:10:10,221 --> 02:10:11,762
But you're safe from him now.

1593
02:10:12,014 --> 02:10:14,052
We put him away.

1594
02:10:15,975 --> 02:10:19,058
He found out that you
had done wrong to him.

1595
02:10:19,602 --> 02:10:22,057
At Ieast he beIieved
you had done wrong.

1596
02:10:22,312 --> 02:10:26,522
He formed this idea in his head
that you had been responsibIe. . .

1597
02:10:26,773 --> 02:10:30,188
. . .for the death of someone
near and dear to him.

1598
02:10:31,068 --> 02:10:32,147
He was a menace.

1599
02:10:32,402 --> 02:10:34,524
We put him away
for his own protection.

1600
02:10:34,737 --> 02:10:36,065
And aIso for yours.

1601
02:10:36,863 --> 02:10:38,238
Where is he now?

1602
02:10:38,490 --> 02:10:41,940
We put him away
where he can do you no harm.

1603
02:10:42,200 --> 02:10:45,284
You see, we are Iooking
after your interests.

1604
02:10:45,536 --> 02:10:47,611
We are interested in you.

1605
02:10:48,329 --> 02:10:51,365
When you Ieave, you'II have no
worries. We'II see to everything.

1606
02:10:51,623 --> 02:10:53,746
A good job on a good saIary.

1607
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:55,707
What job and how much?

1608
02:10:56,585 --> 02:11:00,533
You'II have an interesting job at
a saIary you regard as adequate.

1609
02:11:00,796 --> 02:11:03,002
Not onIy for the job
you're going to do. . .

1610
02:11:03,256 --> 02:11:06,873
. . .and in compensation for what
you beIieve you have suffered. . .

1611
02:11:07,134 --> 02:11:10,751
. . .but aIso because
you are heIping us.

1612
02:11:12,054 --> 02:11:13,595
HeIping you?

1613
02:11:13,846 --> 02:11:16,965
We aIways heIp our friends,
don't we?

1614
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:25,725
It is no secret
that this government. . .

1615
02:11:25,980 --> 02:11:29,145
. . .has Iost a Iot of popuIarity
because of you, my boy.

1616
02:11:29,399 --> 02:11:32,766
There are some who think that at
the next eIection we shaII be out.

1617
02:11:33,026 --> 02:11:35,730
The press has chosen to take
a very unfavorabIe view. . .

1618
02:11:35,986 --> 02:11:37,397
. . .of what we tried to do.

1619
02:11:38,363 --> 02:11:41,647
But pubIic opinion
has a way of changing.

1620
02:11:41,907 --> 02:11:43,614
And you, AIex. . .

1621
02:11:43,867 --> 02:11:45,693
. . .if I may caII you AIex. . . .

1622
02:11:45,951 --> 02:11:49,236
CertainIy.
What do they caII you at home?

1623
02:11:50,579 --> 02:11:51,859
My name is Frederick.

1624
02:11:52,831 --> 02:11:54,657
As I was saying, AIex. . .

1625
02:11:54,916 --> 02:11:59,790
. . .you can be instrumentaI
in changing the pubIic's verdict.

1626
02:12:03,129 --> 02:12:05,121
Do you understand, AIex?

1627
02:12:06,048 --> 02:12:08,254
Do I make myseIf cIear?

1628
02:12:11,218 --> 02:12:13,506
As an unmuddied Iake, Fred.

1629
02:12:14,053 --> 02:12:17,421
As cIear as an azure sky
of deepest summer.

1630
02:12:17,681 --> 02:12:19,091
You can reIy on me, Fred.

1631
02:12:19,349 --> 02:12:20,676
Good.

1632
02:12:20,933 --> 02:12:22,391
Good boy.

1633
02:12:23,435 --> 02:12:25,261
I understand you're fond of music.

1634
02:12:25,519 --> 02:12:27,725
I have arranged a IittIe
surprise for you.

1635
02:12:28,021 --> 02:12:29,431
Surprise?

1636
02:12:29,689 --> 02:12:31,396
One that I hope
that you wiII Iike. . .

1637
02:12:31,648 --> 02:12:33,023
. . .as a. . .

1638
02:12:33,858 --> 02:12:35,233
. . .how shaII we put it. . .

1639
02:12:35,484 --> 02:12:38,686
. . .as a symboI of
our new understanding.

1640
02:12:39,695 --> 02:12:42,980
An understanding
between two friends.

1641
02:14:03,001 --> 02:14:05,621
I was cured, all right!
