1
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:45,490
I'll take that now, sir. Thank you.

2
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:58,538
- There you are, sir.
- Thank you.

3
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:05,900
- It's the heater switch.
- You told me that last week.

4
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,999
- You didn't leave it long enough.
- Work on it now.

5
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,405
- You got an appointment?
- What are you, a doctor?

6
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:20,176
<i>The bakery workers' strike continues
with no bread for a week.</i>

7
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:23,262
<i>Unseasonable temperatures
for New York...</i>

8
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,432
Gotta change... Come on, start.

9
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:30,337
<i>- ...with a humidity of 79%.</i>
- Damn.

10
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,260
I've gotta make an appointment?

11
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,976
- Get away from there!
- Get out of here!

12
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,442
What are you going to do?

13
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:08,212
Move that crate!
Will you move that heap?

14
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:12,379
- I'm talking to you, mister! Move!
- All right.

15
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,400
You're a menace!

16
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,145
Do you know that,
you senile, old cooker?

17
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:27,243
Don't you tell me to <i>langsamer,</i>
you Kraut meathead!

18
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,912
<i>- Langsamer!</i>
- Go on!

19
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,987
You Limburger-loving schmuck!

20
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:41,090
<i>Jude</i>! You are a <i>Jude!</i>

21
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,585
You Nazi bastard!

22
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:07,393
Go on! Get going,
you Mercedes bastard!

23
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:15,017
Get going! How do you like that?

24
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,794
Come on!

25
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,367
Damn it!

26
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,710
Come on!

27
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,106
How do you like that?

28
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:16,257
Hey! You maniac, you!

29
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,681
Go on, you son of a bitch!

30
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:25,110
Come on! Come on back!

31
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,515
You anti-Semitic bastard, you!

32
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,071
Come on back!

33
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,967
Behind schedule?

34
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,964
Put a leash on that dog!

35
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,300
Here comes the Creep. Yo, Melendez.

36
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:54,471
Hey. Creepy! Hey, twinkle toes!

37
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,601
Creepy!

38
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,069
Gonna time yourself in the shower?

39
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:25,177
What was it yesterday?
16:02. I was faster. Shit!

40
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,440
<i>...has shattered the peace
of this East Side neighbourhood</i>

41
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,276
<i>on this traditional Jewish
holiday of Yom Kippur.</i>

42
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:38,197
<i>Two men have been
killed in this accident.</i>

43
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:41,408
<i>An explosion and fire,
which you see behind me.</i>

44
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:46,455
<i>I'm going to talk to some people
to find out what happened.</i>

45
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:50,375
<i>- What were you doing here?
- I was taking pictures.</i>

46
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:54,880
<i>- Can you tell me what happened?
- "Boom", that's what.</i>

47
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:58,050
<i>One of the men killed
here was Klaus Szell,</i>

48
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:01,720
<i>the brother of the infamous
Nazi, Christian Szell,</i>

49
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:06,141
<i>thought to have perished fleeing
Berlin at the end of World War II.</i>

50
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,887
<i>Tom Ellis, reporting
direct from the scene.</i>

51
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,173
What's this?

52
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:41,134
They are protesting
against pollution.

53
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,752
They are a pain in the ass.

54
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,968
Janey!

55
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:35,222
London was hectic, but I'm fair.

56
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:40,391
Get a cab and get over here.
I've got plenty of room.

57
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,990
Oh, screw appearances. I miss you.

58
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,149
Just a second.

59
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,987
Excuse me, that's not my suit.

60
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:12,172
I don't know what it was about.
The valet came into the wrong room.

61
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,103
I'm not jittery.

62
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,356
Who else knows I'm here?

63
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,430
Are you sure?

64
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:26,399
Why don't you finish what you're
doing and get your ass over here?

65
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:38,429
- ...in francs is a lot of money.
- Is it really?

66
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:46,361
The price is too high.

67
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,113
You do speak English?

68
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,273
I'd like to offer you half.

69
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,625
- Bon appétit, bon appétit.
- I guess I didn't do it right.

70
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:04,280
We haven't done anything
right on the whole voyage.

71
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:08,121
I'm far too sensitive
for this kind of work.

72
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:13,047
Something for your crash diet,
LeClerc. The least I could do.

73
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,625
<i>Merci</i>, Scylla.

74
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:22,052
My diet is going badly.
I'm beginning to think I lack willpower.

75
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,052
Why were you surprised to see me?

76
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,221
I wasn't.

77
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,560
You were when I came in.

78
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,892
Did you think I was dead?

79
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:38,079
That's ridiculous. I expected
you three days ago, that's all.

80
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,581
London got busy.

81
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:43,486
I'm over here to do a lot of things.
You're only one of them.

82
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,488
Mmm.

83
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,046
I haven't got anything for you here.

84
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,507
- Why not?
- Well...

85
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,268
I couldn't keep it in the shop.

86
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,939
Look. I'll have it for you tonight.

87
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,025
You'll have to come to the opera.

88
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,803
The opera!

89
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:13,949
It's worse than that.
It's a very long French opera.

90
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,354
You'll have it tonight, won't you?

91
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:22,442
Leave the ticket at the box office.
I'll be there before it's over.

92
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,245
Plaza Athénée.

93
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:28,178
Mike, who you have for
English lit? Bayley? He sucks.

94
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,526
- Which room is Biesenthal's?
- 107.

95
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,931
You were picked for his seminar?

96
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,520
You weren't?

97
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:44,956
Ah, Levy. Good of you to come.
Won't you join us?

98
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,126
Tell us the subject of
your dissertation, please?

99
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,995
Tyranny, sir.

100
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:54,466
The use of tyranny in
American political life.

101
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,119
Such as?

102
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,129
Maybe...

103
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,808
Coolidge breaking up
the Boston police strike,

104
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,562
Roosevelt putting Japanese-Americans
into concentration camps...

105
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,886
You might consider the
McCarthy business?

106
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,401
- Sir?
- McCarthy.

107
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:18,808
Senator from Wisconsin? Ran a
series of purges in the '50s?

108
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:23,328
Yes, I'm aware of that, sir.
I was planning a chapter on him.

109
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:27,233
A chapter, I see. Yes, interesting.

110
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:32,087
Well, you four have
the dubious honour

111
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:36,925
of having been picked from over
200 applicants for this seminar.

112
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:42,847
There's a shortage of natural resources,
breathable air and adequate claret,

113
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,433
but there's no
shortage of historians.

114
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,687
We grind you out like link sausages.

115
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,341
It's called progress.

116
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:55,261
Manufactured doctorates
is called progress.

117
00:19:55,861 --> 00:20:01,518
I say, "Let us hush this cry of progress
till 10,000 years have passed."

118
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:05,146
That's a quote. Who said that?

119
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,607
Come on. Who said that?

120
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,536
Well, somebody must know the answer!

121
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,384
Tennyson, Alfred Lord Tennyson.

122
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:25,258
You can't compete on a doctoral level
and not know <i>Locksley Hall.</i>

123
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,880
I hope you all flunk! Dismissed.

124
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,129
- Levy?
- Yeah.

125
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,715
Come.

126
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,355
Oh. Sit.

127
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,567
I knew your father.

128
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,167
Rather well, in point of fact.
He was my mentor.

129
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,419
I know.

130
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,505
- There was another of you.
- I have an older brother.

131
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:02,177
A rich, successful businessman.
My father would have disowned him.

132
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:06,014
Why are you at Columbia
for your doctorate?

133
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:11,012
It's not just the way things worked out.
Your father got his at Columbia.

134
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,355
You can't fill his footsteps,
I'm sorry to say.

135
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,358
You might end up leaving
larger tracks than that,

136
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,763
but they'll be your tracks,
they won't be his.

137
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,616
Why didn't you answer
that Tennyson question?

138
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,486
It was obvious you knew.

139
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,157
I don't know.

140
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:37,405
How am I to fathom your mind if
you continue to hide it from me?

141
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,954
If you persist,
I'll conclude you're a drone.

142
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:46,054
The McCarthy section is central
to your dissertation, yes?

143
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:49,959
The McCarthy section is
central to your dissertation, yes?

144
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,965
Yes.

145
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,721
Very worrisome.

146
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:59,234
You wish to write about a period in
our history that destroyed your father.

147
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:02,737
But we're talking about an
objective doctoral thesis.

148
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:07,484
It mustn't become a hysterical crusade.
That's not the way to clear him.

149
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,071
<i>All right, you may go.</i>

150
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:28,919
I don't have to worry about clearing
him, because he was innocent.

151
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,940
Don't you think he was innocent, sir?

152
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,184
No, I think he was guilty.

153
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,607
<i>He was guilty of being arrogant
and brilliant and of being naive.</i>

154
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:51,354
<i>Of not being able to cope with the
humiliation of being dismissed.</i>

155
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:55,456
But of the charges,
I know he was innocent.

156
00:22:55,457 --> 00:23:00,328
And if it matters, Levy,
I wept the day he died.

157
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:05,208
It was a bad day for all of us, sir.

158
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:31,068
Under no circumstances do anything,
but call as soon as you...

159
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,494
Yes, I have the number.

160
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,942
Bye.

161
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:43,171
<i>Bonjour</i>. Commander.
We're meeting tonight, right?

162
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,924
- At the hotel?
- No, make it the Palais-Royal.

163
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:49,135
- Same time, then.
- I don't know. I'm going to the opera.

164
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:52,415
- You go to the opera? Bye.
- Goodbye.

165
00:23:56,936 --> 00:24:00,438
There's something going on
here that we don't know about.

166
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,690
- Can't you be more specific?
- Yes.

167
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,443
I almost got my ass blown
off at the flea market.

168
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,613
I'd like to find out by whom and why.

169
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:11,366
Also, LeClerc was not expecting me.

170
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:15,021
You sure you're not overusing
your limited imagination?

171
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,288
The bomb was not imaginary.

172
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,291
Three bombs a day have gone
off since the strikes began.

173
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:25,213
- I know that.
- Everyone with a grievance is busy.

174
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:28,383
- Am I crazy?
- Yeah, you're crazy.

175
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:31,886
- But you'll check it out?
- Of course.

176
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:35,461
Why do you need to be reassured?

177
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,211
We use you because you're the best.

178
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:43,124
I'm sorry I'm so late. I was down...

179
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:06,219
LeClerc, want to hear
something really silly?

180
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,576
Nicole?

181
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,580
Nicole.

182
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,261
Keep going, keep going.

183
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:20,138
LeClerc's dead.

184
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,382
It's not safe.

185
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,145
Nicole?

186
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,719
<i>- Division.</i>
- Scylla.

187
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,306
<i>- Yes, Scylla?</i>
- Removals.

188
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:35,085
<i>- My hotel.</i>
- Room 72?

189
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:41,390
<i>- And alert the clinic.
- Okay, Scylla.</i>

190
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,755
Sorry.

191
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,032
What was all that about?

192
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:35,937
I was just telling him how you
fucked up my tennis game.

193
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:39,373
What did he say?

194
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,791
Well...

195
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,911
We won't be playing
doubles for a while.

196
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,288
Can you move it?

197
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,619
That's it?

198
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,054
That's it.

199
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,798
That's not bad.

200
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:09,308
Szell's brother's been killed in
Manhattan, an accident with an oil truck.

201
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,356
Oh, boy.

202
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,744
Any changes?

203
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,738
Only everything.

204
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,905
They're getting all the couriers.

205
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:59,780
Please could you tell me,
Boss Tweed, around 1875...

206
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:03,359
Boss, is that his name? Boss?

207
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:06,627
No, that's his nickname.
William Marcy Tweed.

208
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:09,702
- Marthy...
- I'll write it down for you.

209
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:20,126
They called him Boss,
because he was a corrupt politician.

210
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:25,479
He had a bunch of political
hacks called "the Tweed ring".

211
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,398
This I know. Thank you.

212
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:30,143
- Could I have the pencil, please?
- It's mine.

213
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,271
Miss Opel!

214
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,867
Miss Opel!

215
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,955
Miss Opel. Hi. Sorry.

216
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:38,302
You forgot your book.
I thought it might be important.

217
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:41,252
- Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.

218
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:46,143
Your name and address
were on the inside of it,

219
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,647
in case you were wondering
how I knew where you live.

220
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,800
I wasn't.

221
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,970
- Thank you again. Bye.
- Bye.

222
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,976
Goodbye.

223
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,982
Bye.

224
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,411
You say "good night",
but you don't go.

225
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:08,332
I twisted my ankle on the way.
I was hoping to rest it.

226
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:11,418
- But you're not limping.
- I'm a marathon runner.

227
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,338
When you race 26 miles,
you don't give in to pain.

228
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:18,842
- It hurts, but I don't pay any attention.
- You won at this?

229
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:22,680
I haven't run a whole
marathon yet, but I hope to.

230
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:26,085
I wish you good luck. Bye.

231
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:29,353
- I'm sorry I stole your book.
- What?

232
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:32,690
I took your book. I didn't
know how to talk to you.

233
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:35,025
I was embarrassed,
so I took your book.

234
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:38,529
- Aren't you embarrassed now?
- Yeah, I'm humiliated.

235
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,490
Why do you pursue people
who sit at your library table?

236
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:45,691
I don't. It's just
that you're pretty.

237
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:52,710
I can't talk about how smart you are.
I don't know you. I'm done lying.

238
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:55,462
Are you always so
incompetent with women?

239
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:59,967
- Today is above average for me.
- Congratulations. Good night.

240
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:03,053
That's too bad. I could
make you so happy.

241
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,221
I'm smart as a whip.

242
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:07,141
You won't meet another
thief like me in a library.

243
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:09,840
Why don't you say you'll see me? Huh?

244
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:13,552
All right. I'll see you again.

245
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:15,649
But it won't come to anything.

246
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,393
You can't tell.

247
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,396
Yes, I can.

248
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,940
- How do you say "seals" in French?
- <i>Phoques.</i>

249
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:46,610
So you look at the <i>phoque</i>?
How do you spell that?

250
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:49,279
- You don't believe it.
- How do you spell it?

251
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,024
- F-O-C.
- No "K"?

252
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,458
I like you.

253
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:12,344
I like you, too.

254
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,097
<i>- Merde.</i>
- I know.

255
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:41,373
- What's the time?
- 11:47. You're faster.

256
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:43,583
- It's 'cause of you.
- Come on. Lunch!

257
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,986
- One more!
- Oh, no!

258
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:24,780
No, Babe. Not again.

259
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,197
Come on.

260
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,456
I can't!

261
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:46,547
Neither can I.

262
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:50,556
Thank God!

263
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,951
Come on.

264
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,195
What?

265
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:38,019
Babe! Babe.

266
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:40,659
Babe!

267
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,087
Babe!

268
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:07,894
<i>"Dear, Doc, I don't
feel much like writing,</i>

269
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,230

<i>Will passengers who have identified

289
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,165
The land of plenty.

290
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,885
They were always so confident
God was on their side.

291
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,880
Now, I think they are not so sure.

292
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:27,761
Who's there?

293
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:29,755
Who is it?

294
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:35,336
I got a gun.

295
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,172
I got a gun.

296
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:52,619
- Articulate as always.
- Prick. You scared the shit out of me.

297
00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:56,998
- What time is it?
- Don't know. Must be about midnight.

298
00:47:56,999 --> 00:48:00,460
- Why didn't you say you were coming?
- I wanted to test your reflexes.

299
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:02,796
- Still challenging me?
- As always.

300
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:06,326
Don't worry about me.
Worry about yourself.

301
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:10,011
Waking me up in the
middle of the night.

302
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,388
- Ouch!
- What's the matter?

303
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:15,259
Doesn't matter. I could
take you with one hand.

304
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,688
- How are you?
- Fine. How are you?

305
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:23,968
- You look terrific.
- You look terrific.

306
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:29,656
- What happened?
- A lousy bottle of Mouton broke on me.

307
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:31,825
Hey, get some glasses.

308
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:35,620
Do I have to hear a lecture on
the glories of a Burgundy again?

309
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:40,993
This is a Beaujolais, schmuck.
Moulin-a-Vent, '71.

310
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:46,381
Don't you ever clean
this armpit of a place?

311
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:48,258
How can you live like this?

312
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:49,926
I'm down in Washington.

313
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:53,054
- Here we go.
- I can put you up. Go to Georgetown.

314
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:54,848
No, thank you, but I prefer my hovel.

315
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:57,016
- I'll do it.
- Thanks.

316
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,919
You did it, huh?

317
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,147
- You really are uncouth.
- You wanted glasses.

318
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:05,768
You didn't say they needed
to be clean, asshole.

319
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,604
So, how's business?

320
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:14,200
- The oil business is always good.
- Just a bunch of polluters and thieves.

321
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,452
It's a crazy world.

322
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:17,537
Any way you can skin
it is your business.

323
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:19,565
- Cheers.
- Up yours.

324
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:27,035
- Irmgard must love your style.
- We don't drink this shit.

325
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:32,427
- What happened in the park?
- Exactly what I wrote you.

326
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:34,095
- How many?
- Two.

327
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:37,932
- Kids?
- They were more like businessmen.

328
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:41,803
They looked like you.
They had suits on.

329
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:46,024
What's this?
More bullshit for your thesis?

330
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:48,902
Some interviews about Dad. Read them.

331
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:50,778
Not interested.

332
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,447
I just want you to read it.

333
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:55,783
Face it. The old man is dead.
He was a drunk. He killed himself.

334
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:59,245
He didn't start to drink
till after the hearings.

335
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,788
I got it from his friends.

336
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:04,167
- Where were those people then?
- They were afraid.

337
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:07,420
- You're throwing your life away.
- I don't think so.

338
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,088
Nothing you write will change that!

339
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:12,493
- Give me the courtesy to read it!
- It's over! Forget it!

340
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:16,122
Maybe for you.

341
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:31,811
Do you want me to become
a corporate hustler like you?

342
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:37,522
- My life's thrown away, anyway.
- What do you mean?

343
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:40,286
I'm supposed to be the
best in my business.

344
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:43,031
I'm the best because
people think I am the best.

345
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:47,661
I'm past it. I know it. Soon it'll
become common knowledge.

346
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:51,365
Boy, something has gotten you.

347
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:54,285
Babe...

348
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:01,087
I bet you still have
that goddamn gun.

349
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,895
Why do you keep it?

350
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:18,768
I don't know.

351
00:51:22,705 --> 00:51:27,125
For a liberal pacifist, you've got
some sense of vengeance.

352
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:29,711
Is Helga as morbid as you?

353
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:33,381
I know you're trying to bait me.
You know her name isn't Helga.

354
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:36,509
Or Ursula or Irmgard.

355
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:40,346
- You know what her name is!
- All right, all right.

356
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:43,016
Can I take you and
Elsa to lunch tomorrow?

357
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:46,185
- But don't eat with your fingers.
- I promise.

358
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,687
It's a deal.

359
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:50,690
- Okay, I get the bed.
- Same as always.

360
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:52,684
You have any clean sheets?

361
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:56,188
I think I may have one left.

362
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:07,582
I really wanted to say that...

363
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,030
What?

364
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:10,694
What?

365
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,706
I'm glad to see you.

366
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:19,415
Doc?

367
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,959
I'm glad you came down.

368
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:35,193
- When did you last take a subway?
- About 1962.

369
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:39,072
Excuse me, sir. Would you
mind putting on this tie?

370
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:40,448
Why?

371
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:44,202
It's a rule of the house.
You have to wear a tie here.

372
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:47,830
- I don't have a button.
- Put it here.

373
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,291
- Would you like me to help?
- No, I can do it.

374
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:53,586
- Fine. Thank you very much.
- What a klutz.

375
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:58,091
- How could you forget a tie?
- Who wears a tie for lunch?

376
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:01,120
At least his fly is buttoned.

377
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:04,502
The truffles en croute
here are marvellous.

378
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:09,435
And if you get hungry,
I'll send the waiter to McDonald's.

379
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:12,009
- Does it look all right?
- Perfect.

380
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:17,686
- Number 36, Chablis Grand Cru.
- Yes, sir.

381
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:24,477
The great Chablis of the world
are almost always green-eyed.

382
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:29,774
In fact, they're the ones
that most resemble diamonds.

383
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:44,538
Please, start.

384
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,710
Sir.

385
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:53,388
- You approve?
- Too much.

386
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:55,273
- It's delicious.
- It should be.

387
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:58,052
I could pay my tuition
for what this meal costs.

388
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:02,894
See the watch he gave me
the last time he was here?

389
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,558
Nice.

390
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:07,785
Do you miss home? I bet you do.

391
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:12,407
What do you miss most of all?
The people? The country? Skiing?

392
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:14,834
I suppose all.

393
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:17,033
I'm not that familiar
with Switzerland.

394
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:18,880
What part are you from?

395
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:22,080
A tiny place. Verbier.

396
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,377
Verbier?

397
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:26,955
- I don't believe it!
- What?

398
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:31,476
A guy in my office, a ski bum,
a pain in the ass about skiing.

399
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:32,518
Excuse me.

400
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:38,566
He's always going on about Verbier.
Right at the foot of Mount Rosa?

401
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:41,944
- It's the best skiing in the world. True?
- Of course.

402
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,739
- Was he 100% right?
- Sure.

403
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:47,116
You must know Claude LeSeur.

404
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,118
- Have you skied with him?
- Yeah!

405
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,203
Where is it?

406
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:52,606
- Verbier.
- Verbier.

407
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,155
I've made all this up.

408
00:54:56,210 --> 00:55:00,213
There's no Mount Rosa in
Verbier or Claude LeSeur.

409
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:02,662
You're not Swiss. What are you?

410
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,293
What are you?

411
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:08,956
- Can't you guess?
- Sure. German.

412
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:12,968
- Anything else?
- How long are your papers good for?

413
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:16,437
Wait. If this is a joke,
it's not funny.

414
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:19,682
I don't need work papers.
I'm a student here.

415
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:23,903
Many foreigners marry Americans
to make things legal.

416
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:26,989
- Then the marriages don't work out.
- Is that what you think of me?

417
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,241
Stop it.

418
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:31,619
- Ask me if I care for him.
- Why? You haven't told the truth so far.

419
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:35,414
Why don't you ask me if I
love him? Why don't you...

420
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:38,334
Wait a minute. Elsa! Wait!

421
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:41,712
Let her go. She's a phoney.
She's after something. Can't you see it?

422
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:44,036
Stay out of it!

423
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:22,329
- You ordered Scylla to be prompt?
- <i>Ja.</i>

424
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:59,749
You keep me waiting.
Why? To upset me?

425
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:00,833
Good evening.

426
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,960
I'm not one to be mocked. Behave...

427
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:06,255
Don't give me shit about my behaviour.
Not after what you've been pulling.

428
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:09,660
- I've done nothing.
- So Chen acted on his own?

429
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:14,889
I don't mind you hiring him,
but getting my brother involved?

430
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:17,308
- It was nothing.
- It was a violation.

431
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:19,810
We do not involve family, ever.

432
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:23,215
Think of it as a warning.
Nothing more.

433
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:28,436
Think of that as a warning
and nothing more.

434
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:32,482
You'd like to fight, wouldn't you?

435
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,942
It will not happen.

436
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:38,314
I'm much too old and
far too smart for that.

437
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:42,652
But we must talk. Truthfully.

438
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:47,072
- Are you to be trusted?
- No.

439
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:53,511
Is that the truth, or are you
trying again to upset me?

440
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:57,014
- You'll go to the bank sooner or later.
- Perhaps I've already been.

441
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:59,558
If so, you wouldn't be here with me.

442
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:02,728
- What else do you know?
- I know you're panicking.

443
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:06,315
- You think you'll get robbed.
- Who would do that?

444
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,969
- Obviously, you think I would.
- Well?

445
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:13,072
- Can I trust you?
- You never could. You only had to.

446
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:15,817
We're talking of my safety.

447
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:19,154
- May I be candid?
- Yes.

448
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:22,566
I couldn't give a fuck about you...

449
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:25,061
Hello? Hi, Elsa.

450
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:27,813
Are you all right?
Did you get my note?

451
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:31,764
I've been trying you for two hours.
Finally, I just went running.

452
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:34,987
<i>I'm sorry about your brother.</i>

453
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:37,686
- It doesn't matter.
<i>- It does!</i>

454
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:40,451
I don't care. Forget it.
It didn't happen.

455
00:59:40,452 --> 00:59:43,947
<i>I wanted to explain.
I lied about the Swiss, because...</i>

456
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:52,701
<i>Take it easy, will you?
I can't understand.</i>

457
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,716
<i>Let me come over.</i>

458
00:59:55,717 --> 01:00:00,088
Okay? I'll take a shower,
I'll be there? Thanks. Okay, bye.

459
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:11,842
Doc!

460
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:25,943
- What? What?
- Babe...

461
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:29,234
I can't hear.

462
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:58,654
You look at me like I'm
doing something wrong,

463
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:01,979
like I did something wrong,
I don't understand it.

464
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:05,786
I don't know anything.

465
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:08,164
- Your name?
- I told you my name!

466
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:10,666
- Take it easy.
- Thomas Babington Levy.

467
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:11,750
You're a student.

468
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:15,826
I come from a family of historians.
My card is proof.

469
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:21,969
Please put the papers down.
Tell them. Put the papers down!

470
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:24,763
Take it easy. What's in the papers?

471
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:27,433
It's a paper I'm writing.

472
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:29,310
Would you tell me who this is?

473
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:30,436
It's my father.

474
01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:32,339
Where can we contact him?

475
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,058
He's not alive any more.

476
01:01:36,151 --> 01:01:40,279
- Is this yours?
- Yes. The license is in the drawer.

477
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,447
I don't know anything.

478
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:45,603
Why ask about this?
It has nothing to do with it.

479
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,521
Okay, enough.

480
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:52,317
- Here.
- Thanks.

481
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:57,463
I know this wasn't easy and
this is a bad time for you,

482
01:01:57,464 --> 01:02:01,539
but it's gotta be done,
you can understand that, right?

483
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:05,914
Good evening, sir.

484
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:39,129
- Whoever did it must have set him up.
- Get them all out of here.

485
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:41,453
I'll get the ambulance guys.

486
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:52,089
I'm sorry to intrude. I was
a friend of your brother's.

487
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:56,772
My name is Peter Janeway.
Call me Janey. All my friends do.

488
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,175
I'm not your friend.

489
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:02,224
Listen.

490
01:03:02,988 --> 01:03:07,894
- I'm anxious as you to find who did this.
- I'm a little more anxious.

491
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:12,788
- I think it may have been political.
- Political? Why?

492
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:16,614
Considering what your brother did.
And your father, of course.

493
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:20,379
- What about my father?
- He was H.V. Levy, for Christ sakes.

494
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:23,257
He's been dead for 20 years,
and he was innocent.

495
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:25,376
What are you saying?

496
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:29,096
Get off my back! They've been
after me for two hours!

497
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:30,514
I didn't mean to imply...

498
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:33,964
They told me they were done!
What are you saying?

499
01:03:34,853 --> 01:03:36,630
I'm sorry.

500
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,967
Come in.

501
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:24,226
Listen...

502
01:04:24,736 --> 01:04:28,436
Why don't we begin with
what happened tonight, hmm?

503
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:36,774
Perhaps you could give
me some of the details.

504
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:41,911
I was here. Doc died. You came.

505
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:44,614
That's it?

506
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:47,750
I'm a demon for details.

507
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:54,264
- You want me to explain, then?
- That's right.

508
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:56,475
- Where did your brother live?
- In Washington.

509
01:04:56,476 --> 01:05:00,005
- What did he do?
- Oil business.

510
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,980
Wrong.

511
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:04,608
I know exactly how
Doc made his living.

512
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:09,113
The closest he got to the oil business
was when he filled up with gas.

513
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:13,519
- Tell me what you're talking about.
- All right. Follow me.

514
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:17,037
Doc lived in Washington,
which is the centre of...

515
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:18,997
- Government.
- Correct.

516
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:21,458
All the branches are competitive.

517
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:24,453
Truth is they're all
paranoid schmucks.

518
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:28,966
When the gap gets too large between
what the FBI can handle effectively

519
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:33,220
and what the CIA doesn't
wanna deal with, we step in.

520
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:36,249
- Who's we?
- The Division.

521
01:05:36,808 --> 01:05:39,852
- And my brother worked with you?
- Yes.

522
01:05:39,853 --> 01:05:42,051
You're full of shit.

523
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:51,473
- What do you do exactly?
- We provide.

524
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:54,817
- Provide what?
- Anything.

525
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:58,620
And you two work together?

526
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:02,070
Why didn't Doc tell me?
Why did he lie to me?

527
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:05,912
He was afraid you'd be
disappointed in him, I expect.

528
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:11,118
We were very close for
many years. Believe me.

529
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:14,128
I know whereof I speak.

530
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:22,637
Doc was desperate to get here.
Remember anything he said?

531
01:06:22,854 --> 01:06:27,805
He said my name a couple of times.

532
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:33,014
Okay, I'm just guessing now,

533
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:37,318
but whoever killed him will
probably want to speak to you.

534
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:42,027
- I don't know anything.
- They won't know till they talk with you.

535
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:45,489
I'm staying across the park,
at The Carlyle,

536
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:49,489
and if you don't mind,
I'd like to use you as bait.

537
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,375
- Bait.
- Yes.

538
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:56,916
- Will they come tonight?
- No.

539
01:06:57,514 --> 01:07:02,670
I know it's risky, and I don't wanna
force you to do it. It's up to you.

540
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:05,633
Tub.

541
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,632
All right.

542
01:09:16,778 --> 01:09:20,773
All right, I got it. Here it is.

543
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:27,526
Turn it off. All right.

544
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:33,494
Shit. Jesus!

545
01:09:47,809 --> 01:09:49,506
Shit.

546
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:48,064
Help!

547
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:59,663
Help! Help! Please!

548
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:02,579
Somebody help me!

549
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:07,664
Help!

550
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:12,839
Help!

551
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:19,099
Help! Help!

552
01:12:58,749 --> 01:13:00,492
Is it safe?

553
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:16,963
Is it safe?

554
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:19,895
Are you talking to me?

555
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:22,799
- Is it safe?
- Is what safe?

556
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,474
- Is it safe?
- I don't know what you mean.

557
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:31,724
I can't tell you if
something is safe or not

558
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:35,565
unless I know specifically
what you're talking about.

559
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,613
Is it safe?

560
01:13:44,337 --> 01:13:46,614
Tell me what the "it" refers to.

561
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,792
Is it safe?

562
01:13:51,594 --> 01:13:55,248
Yes, it's safe. It's very safe.
So safe you wouldn't believe it.

563
01:13:57,391 --> 01:13:59,509
Is it safe?

564
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:07,184
No, it's not safe.
It's very dangerous. Be careful.

565
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:36,721
Relax, relax.

566
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:40,922
Come on. Open. Open. It's okay.

567
01:14:53,364 --> 01:14:57,242
- That hurt? I should think it would.
- Uh-huh.

568
01:14:57,243 --> 01:14:59,244
You should take better
care of your teeth.

569
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:02,489
You have quite a cavity here.

570
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:06,826
- Is it safe?
- I told you I can't tell you...

571
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:16,712
- Think he knows?
- Of course. He's being very stubborn.

572
01:15:19,473 --> 01:15:22,126
No, please. Please don't. No.

573
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:25,800
It's okay.

574
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:32,652
Is it not remarkable?

575
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:37,407
Simple oil of cloves and
how amazing the results.

576
01:15:37,408 --> 01:15:42,609
Life can be that simple.
Relief, discomfort.

577
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:47,785
Now, which of these I next apply,
that decision is in your hands,

578
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:53,533
so take your time and tell me.

579
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:57,832
- Is it safe?
- Please...

580
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:00,873
Please stop.

581
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:10,887
- Take him.
- I got him.

582
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:02,063
More.

583
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:06,943
Thank you.

584
01:17:11,502 --> 01:17:13,119
More.

585
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:52,989
Thank you. Thank you.

586
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:03,052
Things are coming together.
Down, or your head gets blown off.

587
01:18:03,053 --> 01:18:06,097
Those two guys I wasted
work for Christian Szell.

588
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:07,807
- Know that name?
- No.

589
01:18:07,808 --> 01:18:10,101
He did experiments at Auschwitz.

590
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:15,190
He was called The White Angel,
<i>Der Weiße Engel</i>, due to his white hair.

591
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:17,775
The wealthiest and most
wanted Nazi left alive.

592
01:18:17,776 --> 01:18:20,304
He's hiding out in Uruguay.

593
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:27,452
In '45, Szell told Jews in Auschwitz
he'd help them escape for a price.

594
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:31,039
He started out with gold, naturally,
but went on to diamonds.

595
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,874
Heard this?

596
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:34,334
Szell saw the end early.

597
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:36,544
His brother took the
diamonds to America

598
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:38,963
to a safe deposit box in New York.

599
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:40,215
Szell's brother had the key.

600
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:42,884
The only other key
Szell kept in Uruguay.

601
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:46,930
If he comes out to use it,
he'll expose himself to great risk.

602
01:18:46,931 --> 01:18:51,142
Everything went fine till his
brother got killed by an oil truck.

603
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:53,978
Why was it natural
to start with gold?

604
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:56,814
He took it from the Jews'
teeth before he burned them.

605
01:18:56,815 --> 01:18:58,717
Szell was a dentist.

606
01:19:01,612 --> 01:19:06,115
He's not coming to America,
Mr Janeway. He's here.

607
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:08,076
No. We'd have known it.

608
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:11,329
The dentist almost killed me.
He kept saying, "Is it safe?"

609
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:14,707
White hair? Keep your head down!
Did he have white hair?

610
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:16,626
He was bald.

611
01:19:16,627 --> 01:19:20,088
He's shaved his head!
He's here, and he's panicked.

612
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:24,175
- Why is he after me?
- Your brother was a diamond courier.

613
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:27,470
Szell thinks Doc said something
to you before he died.

614
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:30,974
- Did he?
- You say my brother worked for Szell?

615
01:19:30,975 --> 01:19:34,970
No! He worked for us.
Everything we do cuts both ways.

616
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:38,982
Szell ratted on all his buddies.
He kept track on all the Nazis.

617
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:41,567
When we wanted to bring
one in, we went to Szell.

618
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:44,529
Babe, you gotta do one
thing for me, just one thing.

619
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:47,156
- Quit protecting Doc!
- I'm not.

620
01:19:47,157 --> 01:19:50,785
- He kept alive to say something.
- He didn't.

621
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:53,371
- He must have. Tell me!
- Nothing!

622
01:19:53,372 --> 01:19:55,365
Shit!

623
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:06,718
I thought you killed them.
You killed them!

624
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:08,871
You killed them!

625
01:20:09,888 --> 01:20:12,056
You killed them!

626
01:20:12,057 --> 01:20:14,425
You fucking killed them!

627
01:20:14,435 --> 01:20:16,837
You killed my brother!

628
01:20:23,736 --> 01:20:26,821
I don't think he knows anything.
I think he knows too much.

629
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:30,192
You can afford to think
what you wish. I can't.

630
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:45,506
The gun had blanks,
the knife a retractable blade.

631
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:49,844
Hardly original, but effective enough.
I think you'll agree.

632
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:55,683
I'm told you are a graduate student.

633
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,677
Brilliant, yeah?

634
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:02,815
You're an historian,
and I am part of history.

635
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:06,778
I should have thought you
would have found me interesting.

636
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:10,573
Frankly, I am disappointed
in your silence.

637
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:13,117
Why do you have so little accent?

638
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:17,205
I had alexia as a child.
Alexia is a disease...

639
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:19,999
I know, it's where you can't
understand written speech.

640
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,292
Highest marks.

641
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:27,541
At any event, my writing is childish still,
but I'm a fanatic about spoken language.

642
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:31,636
I envy you your school days.
Enjoy them.

643
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:35,837
It's the last time in your life
no one expects anything of you.

644
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:41,396
I know I behaved terribly,
but I had to be sure what you knew.

645
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:42,969
You see...

646
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:46,150
I'm positive your
brother meant to rob me

647
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:49,904
when I left the bank
with my diamonds.

648
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:51,989
I don't know anything.

649
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:56,566
- Did Scylla plan the robbery alone?
- Robbery?

650
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:03,209
- You know the value of diamonds?
- No, I don't.

651
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:05,878
Neither do I. Not in today's market.

652
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:11,251
Tomorrow, I must go and find
out before I go to the bank.

653
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:14,750
You see...

654
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:20,795
Your brother was incredibly strong.

655
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:24,355
Strength is often inherited.

656
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:25,898
He died in your arms.

657
01:22:25,899 --> 01:22:29,402
He travelled far and in
great pain to do that.

658
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:33,056
There has to be a reason.

659
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:37,486
I don't know anything.

660
01:22:37,828 --> 01:22:39,445
Karl!

661
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:58,181
Please don't worry.

662
01:22:58,182 --> 01:23:02,560
I'm not going into that cavity.
That nerve's already dying.

663
01:23:02,561 --> 01:23:06,397
A live, freshly-cut nerve
is infinitely more sensitive,

664
01:23:07,524 --> 01:23:13,021
so I'll just drill into a healthy
tooth until I reach the pulp.

665
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:17,313
Unless, of course,
you can tell me that it's safe.

666
01:23:31,465 --> 01:23:33,367
Erhard!

667
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:37,595
He knew nothing. If he'd known,
he would have told.

668
01:23:37,596 --> 01:23:39,498
Get rid of him.

669
01:23:44,728 --> 01:23:46,545
I don't think you've heard the news.

670
01:23:54,613 --> 01:23:59,109
- What is that?
- Your flight is at 1:00 tomorrow.

671
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:05,031
- You are a very confident young man.
- It's all a front.

672
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:09,366
Just think of me as any
young executive on the come.

673
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:14,074
You're uncontrollable.

674
01:24:14,258 --> 01:24:18,135
What you offer us is valuable, but it's
not worth the chaos you're causing.

675
01:24:18,136 --> 01:24:22,056
And if I'm unable to conclude
my business by 1:00?

676
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:24,710
You'll just have to
manage that, won't you?

677
01:24:25,394 --> 01:24:28,854
As far as we're concerned,
Mr Szell, you're a relic.

678
01:24:28,855 --> 01:24:31,349
And you're on your way.

679
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:35,319
I find you rather detestable.

680
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:38,114
May I say that without
hurting your feelings?

681
01:24:38,115 --> 01:24:40,483
Praise from Caesar.

682
01:24:41,034 --> 01:24:45,530
I'm just doing my job.
I believe in my country.

683
01:24:48,292 --> 01:24:50,365
So did we all.

684
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:03,335
Jesus!

685
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:08,261
Come on, unlock it.

686
01:25:17,738 --> 01:25:19,530
Get up.

687
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:21,308
Get him!

688
01:25:30,334 --> 01:25:32,782
Hey!

689
01:25:39,718 --> 01:25:41,995
Stop!

690
01:26:03,867 --> 01:26:07,897
- He went around the corner.
- Get the fucking car!

691
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:15,282
He's on the north ramp.
Come on, for Christ sakes!

692
01:28:53,954 --> 01:28:56,356
Run him down! Run him down!

693
01:29:06,883 --> 01:29:09,510
What the fuck...

694
01:29:14,808 --> 01:29:19,588
Why are you walking away?
You guys are crazy!

695
01:29:49,676 --> 01:29:52,511
No, don't slow down. Keep going.

696
01:29:52,512 --> 01:29:54,960
You can drop me at the corner.

697
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:05,274
- Do you have a dime for the phone?
- What, a dime?

698
01:30:05,275 --> 01:30:08,645
Here. Take this and
just give me a dime.

699
01:30:08,904 --> 01:30:10,988
Wait. Let me see what you got.

700
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:15,394
It's a Rolex. My brother's watch.
Hey, come on.

701
01:30:16,202 --> 01:30:17,328
Please.

702
01:30:17,329 --> 01:30:21,029
Here is a dime, man.
Here's some more change.

703
01:30:43,021 --> 01:30:45,898
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Elsa.

704
01:30:45,899 --> 01:30:48,692
<i>Babe? What's the time?</i>

705
01:30:48,693 --> 01:30:51,187
I don't know. About 5:00.

706
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:55,074
I want you to do something
for me, to meet me.

707
01:30:55,075 --> 01:30:57,868
<i>- Where?</i>
- 51st and Broadway.

708
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:00,037
<i>- I can't.</i>
- There's an all-night drugstore.

709
01:31:00,038 --> 01:31:01,830
<i>Why? Tell me what...</i>

710
01:31:01,831 --> 01:31:05,709
Just get hold of a car.
Please. In an hour.

711
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:08,379
<i>- But why?</i>
- I'll tell you later.

712
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:12,455
- 51st and Broadway.
<i>- 51st and Broadway.</i>

713
01:31:12,509 --> 01:31:14,161
<i>Bye.</i>

714
01:32:25,498 --> 01:32:29,903
Mrs Melendez, I have to
see your son, it's important.

715
01:32:44,934 --> 01:32:47,603
<i>I'll cut your finger off if you
don't let go of that buzzer!</i>

716
01:32:47,604 --> 01:32:51,065
Melendez, it's me. I want
you to do a job for me.

717
01:32:51,066 --> 01:32:53,859
<i>One more time and I'm coming
down with the butcher knife!</i>

718
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:58,530
Please. I'm from across the street.
I want you to do something for me.

719
01:32:58,531 --> 01:33:01,867
<i>- Who is this?</i>
- It's Tom Levy from across the street.

720
01:33:01,868 --> 01:33:06,163
<i>- Who the fuck is this?</i>
- Tom... Creepy. It's the Creep.

721
01:33:06,164 --> 01:33:09,534
<i>- Creepy?</i>
- Open up.

722
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:23,722
What happened to you?

723
01:33:23,723 --> 01:33:27,093
Come here. Listen, man,
it's past my bedtime.

724
01:33:27,852 --> 01:33:31,522
I want you to rob my apartment.

725
01:33:31,523 --> 01:33:33,023
Why?

726
01:33:33,024 --> 01:33:34,900
Some guys are after me.

727
01:33:34,901 --> 01:33:38,445
I got a gun in my desk.
And get me some clothes.

728
01:33:38,446 --> 01:33:40,072
What's in it for me?

729
01:33:40,073 --> 01:33:44,523
I got a TV set. I got a hi-fi.
You can take it all. Do it.

730
01:33:44,661 --> 01:33:47,121
What's the catch?

731
01:33:47,122 --> 01:33:50,457
The catch is it's dangerous.
Please do it.

732
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:53,907
That ain't the catch, it's the fun.

733
01:33:56,131 --> 01:33:57,908
Come on.

734
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:36,787
All right, guys. Let's go,
move out of there.

735
01:34:43,052 --> 01:34:45,830
Blow it out your ass, motherfucker.

736
01:35:15,001 --> 01:35:17,294
- Hi.
- Hi, Elsa.

737
01:35:17,295 --> 01:35:20,214
- How... Babe, what's happened?
- God, I'm glad you're here.

738
01:35:20,215 --> 01:35:23,835
- What's happened to you?
- I'll tell you later. Let's go.

739
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:54,250
You like it?

740
01:36:55,977 --> 01:36:58,345
I must get the key.

741
01:37:05,611 --> 01:37:09,766
- How did you find this place?
- I hope the key is here.

742
01:37:14,329 --> 01:37:16,330
How did you find it?

743
01:37:16,331 --> 01:37:18,825
A girlfriend in my building.

744
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:21,535
It belongs to her family. Ah.

745
01:37:28,551 --> 01:37:30,578
Is it Szell's?

746
01:37:32,764 --> 01:37:34,507
Szell's?

747
01:37:35,433 --> 01:37:37,676
Is it Szell's?

748
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:42,928
You're very tired.

749
01:37:45,777 --> 01:37:47,770
Where is Janeway?

750
01:37:52,283 --> 01:37:53,684
Huh?

751
01:37:55,536 --> 01:37:58,413
- What do you do for Szell?
- Babe...

752
01:37:58,414 --> 01:38:00,123
- What?
- I'm sorry...

753
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:05,295
Tell me when they're coming.
What did you do for him?

754
01:38:05,296 --> 01:38:07,798
- Let me explain.
- Explain it.

755
01:38:07,799 --> 01:38:10,008
- Explain my brother! Say it!
- Please. Stop it!

756
01:38:10,009 --> 01:38:16,917
Stop it! Stop it!
Tell me when they're coming.

757
01:38:17,642 --> 01:38:20,295
I don't know, Babe. I...

758
01:38:23,773 --> 01:38:25,675
Soon.

759
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:31,472
Good.

760
01:38:32,990 --> 01:38:34,812
Thanks.

761
01:38:46,087 --> 01:38:49,081
- When did you know?
- I didn't.

762
01:38:49,882 --> 01:38:51,579
Till now.

763
01:39:01,686 --> 01:39:03,963
Whose house is this?

764
01:39:04,355 --> 01:39:06,223
Szell's brother's.

765
01:39:28,087 --> 01:39:29,754
No, Babe. There's
nobody here. Let's go.

766
01:39:44,604 --> 01:39:46,021
Please, Babe. Let's go.

767
01:39:46,022 --> 01:39:49,096
We still have time.
I can get you out of here.

768
01:39:52,153 --> 01:39:54,476
So that was Szell.

769
01:40:00,328 --> 01:40:04,198
- What's keeping them?
- I don't know.

770
01:40:08,753 --> 01:40:10,530
What were you?

771
01:40:11,088 --> 01:40:13,456
Were you Szell's mistress?

772
01:40:13,925 --> 01:40:19,377
- Tell me.
- No. I was a courier. Nothing more.

773
01:40:19,514 --> 01:40:23,714
I took money from Paris
into Uruguay, that's all.

774
01:40:25,019 --> 01:40:27,342
I never even met him.

775
01:40:31,776 --> 01:40:34,178
God, you are pretty.

776
01:41:38,593 --> 01:41:40,370
Where is he?

777
01:41:41,429 --> 01:41:43,422
Where is Szell?

778
01:41:43,514 --> 01:41:46,838
- Where is Szell?
- It's a lovely morning.

779
01:41:53,899 --> 01:41:55,596
Hold it!

780
01:42:02,033 --> 01:42:06,620
We're awaiting further instructions.
Do we take three giant steps or what?

781
01:42:06,621 --> 01:42:09,444
Cops will be here soon.

782
01:42:12,376 --> 01:42:14,870
I don't think the police are coming.

783
01:42:15,921 --> 01:42:19,621
Neither do I, but I could be wrong.

784
01:42:22,845 --> 01:42:28,251
We can work out what you wanna
work out, but shouldn't we do it inside?

785
01:42:31,062 --> 01:42:34,136
Okay. One at a time.

786
01:42:47,244 --> 01:42:49,897
No! Over here. Over here.

787
01:42:50,748 --> 01:42:52,695
Sit. Sit!

788
01:42:53,250 --> 01:42:57,087
You should realise we're only
authorised to go to certain limits.

789
01:42:57,088 --> 01:43:00,537
Cut the bullshit.
Tell me where Szell is.

790
01:43:00,883 --> 01:43:03,502
Why did you let us get so close?

791
01:43:04,261 --> 01:43:06,221
You're all in my killing range now.

792
01:43:06,222 --> 01:43:10,798
Taken target practice, have you?
A wizard at hitting paper?

793
01:43:10,935 --> 01:43:14,938
It's not the same with flesh.
Smashing bone is different...

794
01:43:14,939 --> 01:43:16,439
I wanna know where...

795
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:18,137
Hey.

796
01:43:20,361 --> 01:43:22,263
...Szell is.

797
01:43:22,571 --> 01:43:25,031
If the police were coming,
you wouldn't be so panicky.

798
01:43:25,032 --> 01:43:28,436
- They're coming.
- Somehow I don't believe that.

799
01:43:29,954 --> 01:43:31,981
Turn it on.

800
01:43:32,498 --> 01:43:35,026
Easy. Easy.

801
01:43:35,626 --> 01:43:39,451
We're all gonna take it easy.
Isn't that right, Erhard?

802
01:43:41,132 --> 01:43:45,378
We're all just gonna sit here and
wait for the police, right, Karl?

803
01:43:48,222 --> 01:43:50,420
Where is he?

804
01:43:51,976 --> 01:43:57,313
Elsa, why don't you move away,
give the boy some room to breathe?

805
01:43:57,314 --> 01:43:59,261
No!

806
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:08,241
- Drop it! Get it down!
- All right, it's down!

807
01:44:08,242 --> 01:44:10,910
I didn't want this to happen,
but I couldn't trust them.

808
01:44:10,911 --> 01:44:13,405
I'll give you Szell for your brother.

809
01:44:13,664 --> 01:44:16,192
He's at a bank at 58th and Madison.

810
01:44:20,963 --> 01:44:22,489
Go.

811
01:44:23,007 --> 01:44:24,704
Go!

812
01:44:44,904 --> 01:44:47,306
Babe!

813
01:45:28,697 --> 01:45:32,943
- What are you looking for, sir?
- Anything we can show you today?

814
01:45:36,705 --> 01:45:39,984
Morning, sir. Anything I
could interest you in today?

815
01:45:40,668 --> 01:45:44,993
We heard that you were not there,
but I wouldn't say it was relevant.

816
01:45:45,381 --> 01:45:49,661
I can't give you that much.
That much I don't make.

817
01:46:06,777 --> 01:46:09,279
Okay. Maybe we can make a trade.

818
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:12,949
No trade, I want cash for the ring.

819
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:17,480
If you want cash, I'll give you cash.
Let me take a look at it.

820
01:46:22,084 --> 01:46:25,753
I'd like to see a
three-carat diamond.

821
01:46:25,754 --> 01:46:30,508
Why? If you just wanna see,
go window-shop.

822
01:46:30,509 --> 01:46:33,803
- I was interested in...
- First there's gotta be trust.

823
01:46:33,804 --> 01:46:37,056
So I'll get this three-carat stone.

824
01:46:37,057 --> 01:46:40,643
We'll take it to this
independent appraiser I know.

825
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:44,689
If he doesn't swear I'm practically
giving this stone away,

826
01:46:44,690 --> 01:46:47,901
I just have to get myself
a new brother-in-law.

827
01:46:47,902 --> 01:46:51,070
I'm gonna do you a big favour.

828
01:46:51,071 --> 01:46:55,491
- Can't you just tell me what it's worth?
- I'm no high-pressure artist. I sell value.

829
01:46:55,492 --> 01:46:57,565
You never answer me!

830
01:47:15,763 --> 01:47:18,806
I'm only interested in gem quality.

831
01:47:18,807 --> 01:47:21,851
Around the size of
my little fingernail.

832
01:47:21,852 --> 01:47:25,021
You're talking six carat, sir.
More probably.

833
01:47:25,022 --> 01:47:28,801
- Would that be prohibitive?
- Fifteen thousand.

834
01:47:29,234 --> 01:47:31,227
Fifteen...

835
01:47:31,695 --> 01:47:34,063
Per carat, naturally.

836
01:47:35,032 --> 01:47:36,574
Naturally.

837
01:47:36,575 --> 01:47:38,727
I know you.

838
01:47:38,827 --> 01:47:42,413
Perhaps you do. I'm pretty
good at faces myself.

839
01:47:42,414 --> 01:47:45,625
- I know this man.
- Christopher Hesse. How do you do?

840
01:47:45,626 --> 01:47:48,211
Christopher Hesse. How do you do?

841
01:47:48,212 --> 01:47:51,047
Wait, let me think.

842
01:47:51,048 --> 01:47:53,291
I think...

843
01:47:54,051 --> 01:47:58,297
Surely, you came to our
antique shop in London?

844
01:47:59,139 --> 01:48:00,556
No, that wasn't it.

845
01:48:00,557 --> 01:48:03,726
- No? But you've been to London?
- But I don't think...

846
01:48:03,727 --> 01:48:10,555
Hesse of Golders Green, since '33,
when we got out of Germany.

847
01:48:11,068 --> 01:48:13,361
Our shop is quite fashionable now.

848
01:48:13,362 --> 01:48:15,279
I always wanted to visit London.

849
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:19,951
I suggest you hurry
while it's still there.

850
01:48:19,952 --> 01:48:25,748
I thank you for your time. I'm sorry,
90,000 is far too high for me.

851
01:48:25,749 --> 01:48:29,153
Our little shop isn't that
fashionable. Thank you.

852
01:48:59,116 --> 01:49:01,617
I know that man.

853
01:49:01,618 --> 01:49:05,113
It can't be... Szell?

854
01:49:05,831 --> 01:49:07,858
Szell.

855
01:49:07,958 --> 01:49:10,031
Szell!

856
01:49:10,127 --> 01:49:12,700
Szell! Szell!

857
01:49:14,548 --> 01:49:17,701
My God! Stop him!

858
01:49:18,302 --> 01:49:21,804
Szell! Stop Szell!

859
01:49:21,805 --> 01:49:26,051
It's Szell. <i>Der Weiße Engel!</i>

860
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:30,688
<i>Der Weiße Engel</i> is here.
Oh, my God. Stop him.

861
01:49:30,689 --> 01:49:34,434
Stop him! <i>Der Weiße Engel!</i>

862
01:49:34,818 --> 01:49:38,488
<i>Der Weiße Engel.
He has to be stopped.</i>

863
01:49:38,489 --> 01:49:43,201
My God! He gets away.
<i>Der Weiße Engel</i> is here!

864
01:49:43,202 --> 01:49:46,329
Szell. Stop him! Oh, please help me.

865
01:49:46,330 --> 01:49:50,291
He's a beast. He's a murderer.
You must stop him.

866
01:49:50,292 --> 01:49:55,619
Oh, my God, there he goes!
He's getting away!

867
01:49:56,215 --> 01:49:57,673
She's crazy.

868
01:49:57,674 --> 01:50:01,920
<i>Der Weiße Engel</i> is here!

869
01:50:02,304 --> 01:50:05,127
Stop him! Stop him!

870
01:50:06,183 --> 01:50:09,644
I will stop him! I will stop him!

871
01:50:09,645 --> 01:50:12,548
The beast! The beast!

872
01:50:22,449 --> 01:50:24,647
Szell!

873
01:50:41,635 --> 01:50:46,389
I know who you are, you murderer.
I know who you are!

874
01:50:46,390 --> 01:50:49,634
Help! Help!

875
01:50:49,810 --> 01:50:54,886
The man needs help here!
Help! Quick! A doctor! Quick!

876
01:50:57,234 --> 01:50:59,807
58th Street and Madison.

877
01:51:29,433 --> 01:51:32,382
- Morning, sir. Thank you.
- Thank you.

878
01:51:37,941 --> 01:51:41,971
Two-five-nine-six-six.

879
01:52:06,136 --> 01:52:08,429
All finished, Henry. Thank you.

880
01:52:08,430 --> 01:52:11,974
- Everything all right, Mrs Rosenheim?
- Yes. See you next week.

881
01:52:11,975 --> 01:52:14,252
There you are, sir.

882
01:52:15,103 --> 01:52:18,507
Close the door for the light, sir.
No one can enter.

883
01:52:45,217 --> 01:52:46,618
Ha!

884
01:52:55,352 --> 01:52:57,880
Everything all right, sir?

885
01:52:59,731 --> 01:53:01,678
Yeah!

886
01:53:04,069 --> 01:53:06,096
Yes!

887
01:53:44,443 --> 01:53:46,641
It isn't safe.

888
01:53:49,239 --> 01:53:50,936
Move.

889
01:53:51,908 --> 01:53:54,310
They're all dead. Move.

890
01:53:56,038 --> 01:53:59,206
You'd be foolish to
do anything hasty.

891
01:53:59,207 --> 01:54:00,583
Move.

892
01:54:00,584 --> 01:54:02,376
I have things in my possession...

893
01:54:02,377 --> 01:54:03,994
Just keep moving.

894
01:54:18,185 --> 01:54:24,148
<i>Name is Arnie, walks with a limp,
green jacket, brown pants.</i>

895
01:54:24,149 --> 01:54:26,017
<i>Ten-four.</i>

896
01:54:53,929 --> 01:54:58,015
- What are you guys doing in here?
- We'll just be a little while.

897
01:54:58,016 --> 01:55:01,386
- There's nobody allowed in here.
- Well, get out!

898
01:55:01,478 --> 01:55:03,175
Get out!

899
01:55:04,314 --> 01:55:05,931
Hurry up!

900
01:55:09,152 --> 01:55:11,805
Okay, let's see what you got.

901
01:55:13,990 --> 01:55:16,992
If you will just give me a
chance to get this open.

902
01:55:16,993 --> 01:55:19,316
That's okay. Take your time.

903
01:55:32,050 --> 01:55:36,080
All this happened because you were
afraid you were gonna be robbed?

904
01:55:37,097 --> 01:55:38,794
Yes.

905
01:55:38,932 --> 01:55:41,255
But you weren't sure.

906
01:55:41,476 --> 01:55:43,173
No.

907
01:55:45,230 --> 01:55:47,303
Jesus Christ.

908
01:55:47,649 --> 01:55:51,929
I was in a state
of hysteria, you know.

909
01:55:57,242 --> 01:56:00,771
Don't you want to take
a closer look than that?

910
01:56:02,789 --> 01:56:05,317
- No.
- You see...

911
01:56:06,710 --> 01:56:10,171
In a sense, one becomes
more emotional with age.

912
01:56:10,172 --> 01:56:14,925
First after a lifetime of being
taken by friends and enemies alike,

913
01:56:14,926 --> 01:56:18,512
and then, just when you think
you have your possession sure,

914
01:56:18,513 --> 01:56:21,507
your health begins to go.

915
01:56:22,476 --> 01:56:27,855
- That is, of course, the ultimate theft.
- That's close enough.

916
01:56:27,856 --> 01:56:31,650
- In the circumstances, one's paranoia...
- Close enough!

917
01:56:31,651 --> 01:56:34,270
- ...gets out of hand.
- Stop!

918
01:56:42,746 --> 01:56:44,238
Well?

919
01:56:45,248 --> 01:56:48,151
What are you going
to do now, shoot me?

920
01:56:49,127 --> 01:56:51,086
No, I don't think so.

921
01:56:51,087 --> 01:56:55,583
Then you'll take these from me.
If I could say a word about that?

922
01:56:56,635 --> 01:56:58,537
No, you can keep them.

923
01:57:01,806 --> 01:57:05,301
You can keep as many
as you can swallow.

924
01:57:05,602 --> 01:57:08,270
Pardon me, I'm not quite
sure what you said.

925
01:57:08,271 --> 01:57:09,813
Swallow?

926
01:57:09,814 --> 01:57:11,841
Yeah, swallow.

927
01:57:12,442 --> 01:57:14,094
Eat.

928
01:57:18,949 --> 01:57:22,353
- You're joking.
- No, I don't think so.

929
01:57:33,964 --> 01:57:35,616
I'm not joking.

930
01:57:42,722 --> 01:57:44,920
No, wait!

931
01:57:45,809 --> 01:57:48,644
That man who was here
has seen your gun!

932
01:57:48,645 --> 01:57:50,797
He'll bring others!

933
01:57:52,649 --> 01:57:54,392
Swallow!

934
01:57:55,610 --> 01:57:57,933
This is madness!

935
01:58:10,292 --> 01:58:11,989
Swallow.

936
01:59:07,766 --> 01:59:09,634
Again.

937
01:59:22,030 --> 01:59:23,556
No.

938
01:59:24,532 --> 01:59:26,149
I won't.

939
01:59:27,410 --> 01:59:29,653
You'll have to shoot me.

940
01:59:32,540 --> 01:59:34,333
Come on.

941
01:59:34,334 --> 01:59:36,031
Shoot.

942
01:59:41,383 --> 01:59:43,160
You won't.

943
01:59:45,470 --> 01:59:47,292
You can't.

944
01:59:48,932 --> 01:59:51,050
You're too weak.

945
01:59:52,352 --> 01:59:57,758
Your father was weak in his way,
your brother in his, now you in yours.

946
01:59:58,900 --> 02:00:03,350
You are all so predictable.

947
02:00:32,183 --> 02:00:34,335
Go get them!
