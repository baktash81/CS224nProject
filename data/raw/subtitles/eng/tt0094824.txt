1
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,100
Did you guys hear
what happened to Mary Ellen Tobin?

2
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,600
Total humiliation.

3
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,100
She found out that her boyfriend
is part Italian.

4
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,700
I bet I know which part, too.

5
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,200
I've always wondered.
What are you, Kate?

6
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,100
Me?

7
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,300
Erm, we're New Yorkers, originally.

8
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,400
Well, Miffy tells me that the two of you
room together at Radcliffe.

9
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,700
Five iron.

10
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,000
I was at Harvard Law.
I'm very surprised we never met.

11
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,300
Well, I just transferred last year
from Michigan.

12
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,600
I knew someone
who once went to Michigan.

13
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,900
I think it was our maid.

14
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,600
Kate, I am just kidding.

15
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,000
- Outstanding.
- Marvellous.

16
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,900
Marvellously outstanding.

17
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,300
Kate.

18
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,400
Caddy, could you please run
and get me a diet root beer?

19
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,100
Er... The nearest soda machine
is way back at the snack bar.

20
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,000
Er, yeah,
I know where the soda machine is.

21
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,600
Snotty little bitch.
I may never come back.

22
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,800
I know you thlnk

23
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,100

And I can't keep

33
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,800
I'm golng all the way

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,700
Sooner or later gotta love somebody

35
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,300
Don't care how long It takes

36
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,000
You can turn up the heat
But I'm playlng It cool

37

40
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,700
Don't care how long It takes...

41
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,500
Ah, good morning, Mr and Mrs Mannings.

42
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,500
I've not gone to school

43
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,200

Excuse me. Pardon me.
Excuse me. Pardon me. No, no!

47
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,000
My halluclnatlon

May come as some surprlse

49
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,400
You may try to deny It

50
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,300
You're amazed when the clown
slaps you In the face

51
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:33,100
Leaves you dumbfounded there
In hls way, yeah

52
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,700
- I'm golng all the way
- Yeah

53
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,700
- Sooner or later gotta love somebody
- Love somebody

54
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,600
Don't care how long It takes

55
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,800
Llke a shock to the heart
I've got news for you

56
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,600
Maybe I'm not so smart
But I'm nobody's fool

57
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,300
- I'm golng all the way
- Oh, yeah

58
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,900
Hup. Excuse me.

59
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,900
- I'm golng all the way
- I'm nobody's fool, baby...

60
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
One diet root beer.

61
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,900
This... was really good.

62
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,200
Thank you.

63
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,600
I won't be a caddy all my life. I'm
going to car-wash school in the fall.

64
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,000
Back to work.

65
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,500
Ah-ha.

66
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,900
Why don't you girls run along
and I'll take care of the caddies?

67
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,800
- Thank you, Todd.
- Great round, Kate.

68
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,400
Thanks.

69
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,500
All right, hunchbacks, listen up.

70
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,900
The club recently purchased 50
Cushman electric Golf Master golf carts,

71
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,200
which means that once they're delivered

72
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,600
your services as caddies
will no longer be required.

73
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,200
Does this mean that we're fired?

74
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
That's very good.

75
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,200
Pass it on to your brethren, won't you?

76
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Just so there are no hard feelings

77
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,400
I'll see what I can do
about letting you keep those coveralls.

78
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,900
Why don't you ask your father
to join Bushwood?

79
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,700
Imagine how much fun we could have.
All the tournaments we could win.

80
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,800
Oh, that would be great.
I would love that.

81
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,900
But I'm not sure
how my father would feel about it.

82
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,200
Oh. Well, maybe if he saw how dignified
and elegant everything is here...

83
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,700
Dignified and elegant.

84
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah. He'd fit right in.

85
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,100
Well, make up your mind.
You want to play or you want to fold?

86
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,200
Either you play or fold. If you're not
gonna play or fold, you're gonna sit.

87
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,900
Between me and you,
there's more comfortable places to sit.

88
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,400
Hello. Did you pass away?

89
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,300
Come on, hurry up. I'm talking to you.
Are you still living?

90
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,800
Blink twice if you can see me.

91
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,500
I should call you. Low-life phoneys
is what I should call you.

92
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm out.

93
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,700
How do you like that?
Wiped out again.

94
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:02,100
What are you doing gambling on a
job site anyway? I should fire you all.

95
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,200
I'm gonna do something better.
Make you go back to work.

96
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,100
OK, sweetheart, blow the whistle.

97
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,100
For 20 years
he thinks I speak Spanish.

98
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,600
- You don't speak Spanish?
- No, but I listen fluently.

99
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,400
God bless him. He gives that
cockamamie Spanish hell, doesn't he?

100
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,100
- His cheques don't bounce.
- You got that right.

101
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,100
Jack, why do you let him win?

102
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,600
- How did you know?
- I saw your hand.

103
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,900
You had him beat. You had a full house.

104
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,200
I got a full house.
He had a real full house.

105
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,800
Every time I walk in there
I see 24 kids.

106
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,700
You're a soft touch.

107
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,200
Don't tell him that.
I don't want him to know.

108
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,800
If he thinks I'm a wonderful person
he'll try to become my partner.

109
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,700
- Hello. What are you doing here?
- Hey, Jack.

110
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,900
Take chances, I'm insured.

111
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,700
What the hell is happening down there?

112
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,400
You in that tractor!
Can you hear me?

113
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,300
Not those people again!

114
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,100
I told them, you want to save a crummy
house that's about to fall down,

115
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,300
come over to my place.

116
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,800
Sometimes I'm tempted to say "To hell
with it, it's not my field".

117
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,800
But this is your field.

118
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,900
You bought this field. And that field.

119
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,100
You must be worth about $50 million.

120
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,200
It's nobody's business.
I'm worth a lot more than that.

121
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,600
- See you downstairs.
- Wait for me.

122
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,200
Let me talk to 'em. I hate those people!

123
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,000
Then hurry up.

124
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,800
Hey, what the hell are you doing here?
This is private property.

125
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,600
Please let me handle this.
It requires a little diplomacy and tact.

126
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,700
Lady, please, get lost.

127
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,100
People are working. Can't you see that?
You look like you never had a job.

128
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,500
- Mr Hartounian, I presume?
- Yes.

129
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,500
We represent
the Historical Preservation Society.

130
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,400
I have a temporary injunction...

131
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,400
restraining you from demolishing any
structures on the Armstrong Estate...

132
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,600
until the City Planning Commission
rules on our appeal.

133
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,100
What are you talking about?
This is nothing but an old dump!

134
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,700
This building is over 70 years old.
It's part of our heritage.

135
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,500
What are you talking about?
This is a garage, can't you see that?

136
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,100
Do you come from
a long line of mechanics?

137
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,800
It was a carriage house.

138
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,600
It's one of the original buildings
on what was the Armstrong Estate,

139
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,500
the property line of which
ran down to this brook.

140
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,600
Does this look like a brook to you?

141
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,200
This is not a brook, lady,
this is a sewer.

142
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,700
Originally it was a brook.

143
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,900
Originally your family comes from
monkeys. What's that got to do with it?

144
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,500
This property has been laying here,
dead, for 25 years, do you know that?

145
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,100
All of a sudden, I buy it,

146
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,700
I try to put up some decent housing
that working people can afford,

147
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,900
and what do I get? A historical society.

148
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,200
Out the bullshit!

149
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,500
You can't stand working people
living in this neighbourhood.

150
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm not going to argue with you. If you
want us to move you'll have to move us.

151
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,200
No problem. Rayette!

152
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,500
Let's go!

153
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,500
Come on! Come on!

154
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,300
Run!

155
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,600
I run and I run and I run and I run

156
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,500
I can't stay away, darlln'

157
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:41,000
I run and I run
and I run and I run...

158
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,600
Look, Pop, if someone asks you,

159
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,800
we winter in the Bahamas, somewhere in
the Hamptons and don't mention Jersey.

160
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,300
I'm only doing this because I love you.
That's the only reason.

161
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,400
If it was up to me,
I'd rather have a hernia operation.

162
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,000
Come on, Pop, joining Bushwood
is something you should want to do.

163
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,400
You worked hard for what you've got.
You deserve the best country club.

164
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,800
This is the best?
They're a bunch of snobs, that's all.

165
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,900
Look at the names of their kids.
You ever hear their names?

166
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,000
This and this Junior and The First.

167
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,800
The Second, The Third,
The Fifth, The Sixth.

168
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,100
They're brilliant! They can't even
think of a name for a kid.

169
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,200
It's not fair to condemn them
because they have roots.

170
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,400
They got roots like an oak tree. We
got roots. We got roots like a radish.

171
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:32,000
I don't want to be a radish all my life.
So, please, Pop, just try.

172
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,800
- Kate!
- Hi!

173
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,900
Hi.

174
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,100
Er, Daddy,
I'd like you to meet my friend Miffy.

175
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,700
Miffy? Miffy, that's a cute name.

176
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,600
I knew a girl in school once,
we called her Muffy.

177
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,500
Probably for different reasons.

178
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,500
She was an ugly girl. She had a
coming-out party, they made her go back.

179
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,200
They made her...

180
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,000
Well, shall we go?

181
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,700
Todd's waiting on the patio with
a scrumptious junk bonds salesman.

182
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,800
- Good luck, Daddy.
- Good luck. Have a good time.

183
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,300
- Bye.
- Goodbye, girls.

184
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,800
Kate, I am so sorry. I had no idea
what you were going through at home.

185
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,300
- What do you mean?
- Well, I mean your father.

186
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,400
- My father?
- He isn't your real father, is he?

187
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,100
I'll get that for you, sir.

188
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,700
- Are you expected?
- Why, does it show?

189
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,000
You look like a sick man.
I don't want to give you any problems.

190
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,400
I'm looking for Ty Webb.

191
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,200
The room that time forgot.

192
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,300
Mr Webb, your guest.

193
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,300
- Jack!
- I see you're working hard, as usual.

194
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,400
You know how it is. Managing
a large inheritance is a full-time job.

195
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,300
The lawyers and accountants
send me a lot of things.

196
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,200
Got to sign things. A lot of work for
a measly couple of million bucks a year.

197
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,600
I was born with a wooden spoon
in my mouth.

198
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,700
Hm. Must have been hard on your mother.

199
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,600
How's business?
Still building those apartments?

200
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,500
Yeah, yeah,
mostly middle and low-income housing.

201
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,900
No money in it,
but I sleep well at night.

202
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,700
That's interesting.
I sleep well during the daytime.

203
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,000
Where, in a cat box?
You look terrible.

204
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,200
I got it.

205
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,300
There you are.
Who built this thing anyway?

206
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,900
I'll be right with you, Jack.

207
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,700
You know me, I believe a healthy life
needs a balance between work and play.

208
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,900
Give and take. In and out. Yin and Yang.

209
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,400
I heard you get more Yang
than you can handle.

210
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,800
- Hey, Ty, you're looking well.
- Hey, nice to see you, Vinny.

211
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,100
- Er, Ted.
- Whatever.

212
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,000
What you going to do
with all those hearts?

213
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,800
Ty! Damn!

214
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,400
Seven of diamonds.
Keep that queen of spades.

215
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,500
- Have a seat.
- Sure.

216
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,900
- He's ruined the entire hand.
- So you want to join Bushwood?

217
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,800
It's for my daughter's sake.
Me, I couldn't care less.

218
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,900
This place is what the world would have
looked like if the Germans had won.

219
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,600
Well, lucky for us, the Japanese won.

220
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,600
I guess I should introduce you
to some of the members.

221
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,900
- Do you have to?
- Take it easy, Jack.

222
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,600
You just relax.
The important thing is to be yourself.

223
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,000
And of course, lose the accent.

224
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,500
What accent?

225
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,800
Jack Hartounian, I'd like you to meet
some of the oldest members.

226
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,700
- Mr Foreskin.
- Forrester.

227
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,200
Forrester. And Mr Crabs.

228
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,200
And Mr Wrinkle.

229
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,200
- That's Winkler.
- Winkler. And Mr er...

230
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,800
- Or is it Mrs?
- Jamison.

231
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,500
Jamison, that's right. Mrs Jamison.

232
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,400
- Oh, there you are, Ty.
- Hello, Chandler.

233
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,400
- I was looking for...
- PoliGrip?

234
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,500
- No, no...
- Condom machine?

235
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,100
- No.
- That blue stuff you put your combs in?

236
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,600
I was looking for a Mr Hartounian.

237
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,500
Hartounian? In this club?

238
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,700
Oh, you mean Jack? Here he is.

239
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,300
- Hello.
- How do you do?

240
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,500
- I'm Miffy's father. Chandler Young.
- Chandler Young?

241
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,400
I'm at a disadvantage.
I only have one last name.

242
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,100
And quite an interesting
last name it is.

243
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,100
- Hartounian?
- What is your background?

244
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,900
My background? My father was Armenian.

245
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,900
My mother was half Jewish,
half English, half Spanish.

246
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,100
- That's three halves.
- Oh, she was a big woman.

247
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,200
I thought you should meet Chandler.
He's the club president.

248
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,700
You can play golf with him.
If that goes well, a cocktail or two,

249
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,100
and er, maybe some light petting later.

250
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,400
I'll leave that up to you, Chandler.
Well, I got a thing.

251
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,700
He's a little strange.

252
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,700
Elizabeth.

253
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,100
- Oh.
- Jack, this is Elizabeth Pearce.

254
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
Hi, Jack. I sure like your suit.

255
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,000
Thank you.
You're a real nice-looking person.

256
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,900
- Thank you.
- I'll come back when you're dressed.

257
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,900
That's all right. I was just going to
get dressed. Real pleased to meet you.

258
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,400
Wait a minute.
Look what I did. I'm sorry.

259
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,100
It's OK.

260
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:17,000
Oh, is that where that goes? Most women
put that in a different location.

261
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,200
I don't need any there.

262
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,000
I've asked Elizabeth and my wife
to join us to make it a foursome.

263
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:27,400
I wouldn't mind if it's a foursome,
or two twosomes, or four onesomes.

264
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,500
And this is my wife. Cynthia.

265
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,200
Oh, oh. Hello, hello.

266
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,000
Hello.

267
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,500
Oh, no, absolutely not.
It's out of the question.

268
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,700
I refuse to play golf with this man.

269
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,900
Then I take it you've met?

270
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,000
This is the man who is trying
to destroy our community.

271
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,600
It was just a little disagreement
the other day.

272
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,300
Little?!

273
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,100
He tried to run me over
with a steam roller.

274
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,300
What steam roller?
Bulldozer. It was a bulldozer.

275
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,800
I really have to apologise to you. I was
wrong. I'm terribly, terribly sorry.

276
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,900
Darling, a word.

277
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,400
Excuse us for a moment.

278
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,400
Jack, let's get our clubs.

279
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,700
- Let's not make a scene.
- The man tried to kill me.

280
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,500
I'm sure he had his reasons.
The fact is he's here.

281
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,100
- I promised Miffy we'd play.
- It's funny running into Mrs Young.

282
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,100
I bet the first time was funnier.
Sorry I missed that.

283
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,000
Besides, this is an opportunity
for you to save the Armstrong Estate.

284
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,500
You can catch more flies with honey.

285
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,800
Mm.

286
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,200
I'm not going to run some
heavy equipment into a girl like you.

287
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
How sweet.

288
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,200
- Yeah?
- Yes.

289
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,600
So, everybody happy now?

290
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,600
- This should be fun, don't you think?
- I don't see how.

291
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,900
You're the guest.
You have the honour.

292
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,900
I'm only here 15 minutes and already
they want to give me honours.

293
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,200
I must be making a good impression.

294
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,500
You are, Jack. That means
they want you to tee off. Good luck.

295
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,200
Oh. Here goes.

296
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,000
Well, this'll be it.

297
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,000
Here we go.

298
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,400
Now!

299
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,300
Interesting club.
What would you call that?

300
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,500
It's a twelve-gauge.

301
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,000
Twelve-gauge.

302
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,100
Out of ammunition, Mr Hartounian?

303
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
A friend of mine at NASA sent me this.

304
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,200
I'm surprised
that you bother coming out at all.

305
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,400
Surely you could develop a gadget that
would allow you to sit in the club house

306
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,100
and punch buttons all day.

307
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,400
I got a friend working on that, too.

308
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,700
Doesn't that take
some of the sport out of it?

309
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,700
Not at all. Things could go wrong.
Batteries could go low, get static.

310
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,900
Anything could happen. Sometimes
the signal interferes with a pacemaker.

311
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,500
Edward! Edward!

312
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,000
Edward, are you all right?

313
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,700
- Bingo!
- Bango!

314
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,400
I feel all right now.

315
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,600
Must have been that chilidog.

316
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,400
He wants to become a member of Bushwood.
Can you imagine that?

317
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,300
With him around I can imagine anything.

318
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:02,700
So er... what would you say on my
chances of becoming a member here?

319
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,100
Well, thatjust may depend on you, Jack.

320
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,400
This is a lovely neighbourhood.

321
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,600
People hate to see it mucked up
with cheap apartments.

322
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,100
I can't tell you your business,
but you know what they say.

323
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:18,600
One hand washes the other.
You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.

324
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,900
You wouldn't want to disappoint
your daughter, would you?

325
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,700
- There's Daddy.
- Oh, hi.

326
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,600
- I certainly wouldn't.
- Why don't we get you an application?

327
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,300
Leave the real-estate business
to the lawyers.

328
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,700
If you want to leave it to the lawyers,
we'll leave it to them.

329
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,900
But remember, it was your idea.

330
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:45,400
I didn't go to one of those big, fancy
law schools like you did, Mr Pierpont.

331
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,600
So you're going to have
to explain something to me.

332
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,600
How in the world do you expect

333
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,600
Mr Hartounian to voluntarily
stop building on that site

334
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,700
and move this entire housing project
somewhere else?

335
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,000
I don't see it.

336
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,700
Because, sir, he'll have no choice.

337
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,400
Let me explain how the legal system
really works.

338
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,800
OK.

339
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,600
You see, Mr Blunt, if your client
doesn't voluntarily cease and desist

340
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,500
we'll be forced to go through the long
and very costly process of injunctions,

341
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,300
law suits, motions, counter motions,
hearings, appeals...

342
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:26,800
Which will cost you so much
in legal fees and construction delays

343
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,700
you'll wish you'd never heard
of the Historical Preservation Society.

344
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:36,200
Because there's no way in hell we'd let
you come barging into Bushwood Estates

345
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,600
and throw up a lot of cheap housing
for blue-collar trash.

346
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,500
Which one of you
is Chandler Young's son?

347
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,900
I am.

348
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:51,600
You've certainly made it clear how
your legal system works, Mr Young.

349
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,700
Now I'd like to explain a little bit
about the Peter Blunt system.

350
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:02,200
You see... I don't go in
for... law suits and motions

351
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,100
or any of that legal stuff.

352
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:08,700
No, no, see what happens is
I find out where you live

353
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,100
and then I come to your house, see,

354
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:17,600
and I... beat down your door
with a fuckin' baseball bat!

355
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,800
And then I'm gonna make a bonfire
with the Chippendale,

356
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,700
maybe roast that golden retriever,

357
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,500
then eat it!

358
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,800
Then I'm coming upstairs, junior,

359
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
and I'm gonna grab you
by your Brooks Brothers PJs

360
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:38,500
and I'm gonna take your brand-new BMW
and cram it up your tight ass!

361
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,600
Do we have an understanding?

362
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,300
- So, Martha, is he in?
- He's in a meeting.

363
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:55,200
Now get the hell outta here before
I really get mad and hurt somebody.

364
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,300
- I tried to sweet talk them.
- So I heard.

365
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,500
I don't think they went for it. We're
not allowed to build on Bushwood Estates

366
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,100
until we get
the planning commission ruling.

367
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,800
- We have to have a hearing.
- A hearing?

368
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,700
Do me a favour, don't try to sweet talk
the planning commission, OK?

369
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,800
Jack, have a little faith
in your lawyer.

370
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,200
Faith in a lawyer.

371
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,700
- That was great, Daddy.
- It really was, Mr Young.

372
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,700
Thanks, Kate. he's coming along nicely.

373
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,600
Jumping a fine horse is a special blend
of strength, courage and grace.

374
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,600
It's a beautiful thing to watch
when it's done right.

375
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,400
Slow down. Slow down.

376
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,300
- Elizabeth, where's the brake?
- Next to the clutch.

377
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,000
Slow down. Easy, easy.

378
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,100
Son of a bitch! You go this fast again,
I'll send you back to the beer truck.

379
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,900
Whoa! Dog Food!

380
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,200
Daddy. What are you doing here?

381
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,700
I asked him.

382
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,600
Oh, Kate, Elizabeth.
Elizabeth, my daughter Kate.

383
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,700
Oh, Kate, I'm so happy to meet you.

384
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,000
Hello. I can't believe
I'm seeing you on a horse.

385
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,500
He tells me he's been around
horses for years?

386
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,500
Betting on them, not riding them.

387
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,800
You want me to be a gentleman.
They ride.

388
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,100
- Not like that they don't.
- Quite an entrance, Jack.

389
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,600
For a moment, I was afraid
you might fall and break your neck.

390
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,100
Or your arm. Maybe strike your head
against a fence post.

391
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,900
Maybe be dragged several miles
over rough terrain.

392
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,600
Sweet of you to be concerned. So you're
not troubled by our lawyers' meeting.

393
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,200
No, not at all.

394
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,200
Care to take a few jumps?

395
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,400
I don't think he's quite ready
forjumping yet, do you?

396
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,200
Nonsense. Nothing to it.

397
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,000
Hold on tight, grip with your knees.
Let the animal do all the work.

398
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,300
Sounds like my wedding night.

399
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,000
Your horse has quite a gas problem.

400
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,600
It's not the horse.

401
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,200
- Raise all the jumps.
- Yes, sir.

402
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,800
I mean this is crazy.
He could really get hurt.

403
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Almost definitely, I'd say.

404
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,800
Stay behind me and do exactly as I do.

405
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,200
Go!

406
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,700
Ha!

407
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,100
Yee-ho!

408
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,000
A little higher next time. Higher!

409
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,200
You may want to urge him
a little more, Jack.

410
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,200
Come on.

411
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,700
Up, Prince.

412
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,000
This time, Dog Food, over it. Over it!

413
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,700
One more set ofjumps, Jack.
We'll make it an easy.

414
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,800
Having fun yet, Jack?

415
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,800
- Good evening, miss.
- Good evening, sir.

416
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,600
Pop. Daddy.

417
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,900
Did you have to wear that tux?

418
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,400
- Why, what's wrong with it?
- It's... blue.

419
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,700
It's notjust blue.
If you look at it this way it's purple.

420
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,300
If you look at it like this it's gold.

421
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,100
Beautiful, huh? Come on, sweetheart.

422
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,000
People here like their tuxedos black.

423
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,700
Sure. And they like their noses red,
their blood blue, their faces white.

424
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:41,800
Until they hire help and then they want
every face to be black, brown or yellow.

425
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,100
Isn't that amazing?

426
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,900
I'm not a hypocrite enough to go along
with a colour scheme like that.

427
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,500
Look, Pop, I don't expect
you to change all at once.

428
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,200
If you could just
turn down the volume a little.

429
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,000
I'm gonna introduce you to this guy
I really like,

430
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,700
so could you just pretend
you like everyone?

431
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:03,300
Pretend? I'm Jack Hartounian. I can't
pretend to like people I don't like.

432
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,900
Why are you so impressed
by these fonzanoons?

433
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,400
What's a fonzanoon?

434
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,800
A guy who farts in the bathtub
and bites the bubbles.

435
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,600
Nice. Pop, please don't...

436
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,300
Kate. I'm so glad you could make it.
This is for you.

437
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,100
- Thank you.
- That's a fonzanoon!

438
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,100
This is the person
I was telling you about.

439
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,100
Todd, I'd like you to meet my father,
Jack Hartounian.

440
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,600
- A pleasure, sir.
- Why do you look familiar?

441
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:31,200
Because I'm suing you, sir.
Nothing personal, of course.

442
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:35,200
Nothing personal? You think your head
getting busted might be personal?

443
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,200
You think a broken nose
might be personal?

444
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,200
You think your head in a toilet bowl
might be personal?

445
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,600
Have a pig in a blanket.
I love yourjacket.

446
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,800
Doesn't he look nice, Todd?
Kate, it's always a pleasure.

447
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,300
Thank you.

448
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,900
Come with me, Jack. Just over here.

449
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,700
- He's a very funny man.
- Yeah, he's a riot.

450
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,600
Hey, look at this. Chandler.
You want to buy a horse?

451
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,500
Look who's here.

452
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,000
Cynthia.
You must be happy to see me, huh?

453
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,000
Of course.

454
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,400
Hello there. How are you?
What's happening?

455
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,600
Look at this conversation I just had.

456
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:24,100
It's great. It's the first time in here
that someone else got the cold shoulder.

457
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,400
Do you think I care?
I like to talk to myself. You know why?

458
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,900
I like to deal
with a better class of people.

459
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,000
I like that.

460
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,000
Do you rumba, samba, mambo-schmambo?

461
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,500
- I try to tango.
- That's close enough.

462
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:43,400
Kate, will you please look at your
father and my cousin dancing out there.

463
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,500
Excuse me.

464
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,100
Ha!

465
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,700
Boy, this is a tough room.

466
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:08,300
- What are you doing?
- Wow.

467
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,400
I was just practising.

468
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,300
In the dark?
How can you tell where the ball went?

469
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:18,100
You can't. Which is probably why
you don't see a lot of night golf.

470
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,200
How's the party going?

471
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,300
I see. Was it er... Was it that bad?

472
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,300
Harry... just by looking at me,

473
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,400
would you say that I was lower class,
middle class or upper class?

474
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,000
- You're being serious?
- Yes.

475
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,900
I would say... middle.

476
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,000
Upper maybe. Middle upper.

477
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,600
Definitely.

478
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,600
So what are you? I mean, at home,
when you're not doing the caddy thing?

479
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,100
Well, at home we happen to be
upper lower.

480
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,600
But when I'm away at school
I like to pretend I'm lower middle.

481
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,500
But what I aspire to become
is middle middle.

482
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,800
You're obsessed with class, aren't you?

483
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,300
I just want to fit in.

484
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:09,400
But around here it's so important
that you look a certain way,

485
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,500
you have the right friends
and join the right sorority.

486
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,500
Come on, Kate.
Joining the right sorority...

487
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,000
It's not important.

488
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,300
- You know who you remind me of?
- Who?

489
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:25,000
- My father.
- Guess that's better than your mother.

490
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,800
Attention, everyone!

491
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,600
It's time for our little slave auction.

492
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,900
Remember, it's all for charity,

493
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,500
so let's see if we can break
last year's record of $4,500.

494
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,500
Break out your chequebooks
and think Mandlngo

495
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,500
while I read the list
of this year's willing slaves.

496
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,300
What is this all about?

497
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,600
It's a game they play
when they feel guilty about being rich.

498
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,200
They auction off
the judge or chairperson,

499
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,700
and you buy them, take them home and
they sweep your floor, clean your garage

500
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,700
and afterwards you give them lunch
and a martini and it's very civilised.

501
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,900
Civilised. How do you do?
Nice to see you.

502
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,900
Jack. I'd like to have a word with you.

503
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,000
Hey, Chandler, how are you?

504
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,300
Mr Club President, how you been?

505
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,200
I'm having
the time of my life here.

506
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:18,500
- Everything is lovely, wonderful.
- Yes, it is. Here's the thing.

507
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,100
My wife and I spoke
to several of our members.

508
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,800
We feel that after tonight

509
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,200
it might be better if you
didn't visit the club for a while.

510
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,700
- What do you mean "for a while"?
- Ever, actually.

511
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,400
We just don't feel
you're Bushwood material.

512
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:39,200
The messy apartment business,
the attempt on Cynthia's life.

513
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,500
You understand, I'm sure.

514
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,400
I understand.

515
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,400
Good.

516
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:54,000
Our first society slave going up
for bids is the charming Cynthia Young.

517
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,600
So I thought we'd start the bidding
at erm... $50. Do I hear 50?

518
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,800
- $50.
- $100.

519
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,800
- 200.
- 250.

520
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:15,400
- 300.
- Do I hear 325?

521
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,500
- Very well, going once at 300.
- Come on.

522
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,200
- Going twice.
- 325.

523
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,100
- I thought he'd left.
- 325 is bid.

524
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,500
Do I hear 350?

525
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,700
Please!

526
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,300
- Daddy.
- Don't worry. 350!

527
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,800
400!

528
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,700
- 450!
- 500!

529
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,800
Finish him, Chandler.

530
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,100
510!

531
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,500
A thousand bucks!

532
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,000
I have a thousand dollars.

533
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,500
Do I hear more?

534
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,000
- Daddy.
- Very well, going once.

535
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,700
- Father, bid!
- Going twice.

536
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,700
- Chandler!
- What's he waiting for?

537
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,300
Please!

538
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,600
Well...

539
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,200
- Sold! $1,000 to Mr Hartounian.
- Why?

540
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,700
Ha.

541
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,800
- Do you want a tip?
- I want a tip.

542
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,900
Bend from the hip sockets.

543
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,800
If you can see your zipper...
you're screwed.

544
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,800
Hip sockets? OK.

545
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,800
Here?

546
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,100
- No.
- Here.

547
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,300
- Here.
- Here?

548
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,600
- No, here. Yeah.
- Oh.

549
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,000
- That's good.
- Kate!

550
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,900
What is it you're doing out here?

551
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,800
- I'm just hitting some golf balls.
- Want to hit some?

552
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,300
- It's all in the hips.
- Oh, sure.

553
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,000
In my tuxedo,
without my glove or my spikes?

554
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,000
Aren't you an employee, and isn't
there some rule about how close

555
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,600
you're allowed to stand
to members and guests?

556
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,600
Yeah, I think it's 3.5 feet,
but only during working hours.

557
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:19,100
And if my memory serves, wise ass,
didn't I already fire you?

558
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,500
Yes, you did,
which is probably why I'm not working.

559
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,400
Kate, would you like to go back inside?

560
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,000
Actually, I think I might
go home from here.

561
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:35,000
Great idea. I'll drop you, and we can
stop at Bonny's. She's having a party.

562
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,100
Do you want to?

563
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,700
OK.

564
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,800
Thanks.

565
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Thank you.

566
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,300
See you around.

567
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,400
Not around here, she won't.

568
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,400
$1,100 going once.

569
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,400
Someone, please.

570
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,700
Going twice!

571
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:12,300
Sold, Mr Chandler Young for $1,100
once again to Mr Hartounian,

572
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:16,400
who has so graciously purchased
all of our society slaves tonight

573
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:21,400
for a grand total of $11,950.

574
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:26,200
I do hope you'll be able to find enough
little chores to keep us all busy.

575
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,600
I'll think of something.

576
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,200
Come on, guys, let's go!
We've got a lot of work to do.

577
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,100
I really hate this. Easy.

578
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,200
Oh, Jamison!

579
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,200
Hey, stupid, get out of there!
What are you, nuts?

580
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,100
- This is an outrage!
- Tell me about it.

581
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,700
I asked for labourers.
A labourer's a guy with big arms.

582
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,800
Bad teeth.
Just broke up with a waitress.

583
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,500
Hey, you're doin' a fine job.

584
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,800
Listen, a couple of us are going bowling
after work, suck down a couple of beers.

585
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,800
- Wanna come with us?
- Suck down a couple of beers.

586
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,200
Fine. Oh, excuse me... sir.

587
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,500
Hey, Jack, let me ask you a question.
How much did you pay for these people?

588
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,500
$11,900.

589
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:14,800
Well, you got burned. That old broad
can't carry lumber for shit.

590
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,400
All right, Hartounian,
you've had your fun.

591
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,700
What are you trying to prove with this?

592
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,600
I'm not trying to prove anything.

593
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,500
I want you and your friends to see
that people work hard for a living.

594
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,700
Don't tell me about hard work, mister.

595
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,400
I've cut more firewood
than you'll ever see.

596
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,300
It'll take more than you got
to break Chandler Young.

597
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,700
Chandler!

598
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,300
Chandler!

599
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,700
Chandler!

600
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,700
Hey, where's she goin'?
It's not even lunch time yet.

601
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,500
Chandler!

602
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,300
- All in favour?
- Aye!

603
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,200
Opposed?

604
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:11,500
Then it's settled.
Jack Hartounian's finished in this city.

605
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,500
- PP, you handle the IRS.
- Uh-huh.

606
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,200
Contact the police, fire and utilities.

607
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,600
OK.

608
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,600
PM, go to work on his suppliers
and subcontractors.

609
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,400
Excuse me, gentlemen, but aren't we
being a little childish about this?

610
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:30,900
Is punishing this boob
really worth all this time and effort?

611
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,900
- Mm-hm.
- Yes. I think so.

612
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:37,000
Definitely. I'll tell you this.

613
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,500
He'll wish he never set foot
in this club.

614
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,800
Hard to say, huh?

615
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,800
How long do you think it'll be
before you get our power turned back on?

616
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
- What?
- Hard to say. I see.

617
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,600
Well, is it as hard to say as

618
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,400
"Oh, God, help me, there's a man
in my office with a flamethrower"?

619
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,300
- What's going on here?
- We got a problem.

620
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,200
We got no cement, no lumber,
no steel, no nothing.

621
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,000
The building inspector
just pulled our permits.

622
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,700
- Where is the electricity?
- I'm working on it.

623
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,200
- There's a conspiracy.
- What are you telling me?

624
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,400
If you don't back off Bushwood Estates
they'll put us out of business.

625
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,300
That's what they think!

626
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,000
- Hi.
- Jack. Hi. Down here, reading.

627
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,600
Listen, I want to buy
Bushwood Country Club.

628
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:41,300
I made up my mind. I got to get even
with these sons of bitches.

629
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,500
Hold on a minute, Jack. Calm down.

630
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:49,000
- You want to buy Bushwood from me?
- That's right. That's right.

631
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,300
Well, let me ask you this. Do I own it?

632
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,500
I checked it out.
You own 53 per cent of the stock.

633
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,200
53 per cent?

634
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,200
Ah, good old Dad.

635
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,200
No flies on him.

636
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,300
Very few on Mom as I recall.

637
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,400
Mom and Dad.
Well, they're gone now.

638
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,700
- They passed away?
- No, no, Palm Beach.

639
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,700
Wait a minute.

640
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,900
I'm sorry, I think they are dead.

641
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,800
Listen, I want to talk business.

642
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,200
All right, let's talk
over a game of golf.

643
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,100
- But you don't play golf anymore.
- I still play.

644
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,800
Just not outdoors. I finally got it down
to the absolute basic essentials.

645
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:37,900
Club... ball... and swing.

646
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,500
The rest is just walking round the park
wearing funny pants.

647
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,800
Is it safe to hit a ball in here?

648
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,400
Of course. It's a ballroom.

649
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,100
- Want a lift?
- Why not?

650
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,200
There's a tough dogleg
to the right up here.

651
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,100
- So do you want to sell, or what?
- Why are you so upset?

652
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,100
Because they insulted me.

653
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:16,200
First they shut down my building sites.
Then they cut off my power and phones.

654
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,400
- Pulled all my permits...
- Ouch!

655
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,900
Let's look at it
from their point of view.

656
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,900
OK?

657
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,700
I can't wait. I need an answer today.

658
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,900
Take it easy, Jack.
We're gonna have to negotiate.

659
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:36,000
There's gonna be phone calls, maybe
some mail. Talkin' mucho dlnero here.

660
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,200
And probably some American money, too.

661
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,900
A little chunky.

662
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:51,100
I don't care what it costs. I want it.

663
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:54,300
Mm-hm. Tough lie.

664
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:02,800
Jack, if I sell it, half the people
I grew up with won't speak to me again.

665
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,700
They don't speak to you now.

666
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:08,700
That's a very good point.

667
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,300
I'm gonna have to bank it
off the Chagall.

668
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,300
I topped it.

669
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,100
I topped it. Got a good bounce.

670
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,000
- It's in.
- Do we have a deal or not?

671
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,400
- Hm?
- Huh?

672
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,800
- Why not?
- Now you're talkin'.

673
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,600
Do you have a twin sister?

674
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,000
Well, gentlemen, I think we've seen
the last of Mr Jack Hartounian.

675
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:53,400
I guess he learned a little something
about who calls the shots in this city.

676
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,300
Wake up!

677
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:02,700
Now I know what they do with the bodies
once the medical students are finished.

678
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,000
You have incredible nerve, Hartounian.

679
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,000
What makes you think
you can walk into a private club,

680
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:11,200
- and stroll around as if you own it?
- Cos I do own it.

681
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,500
You must be Chandler.

682
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,600
What are you up to?

683
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,600
- Where did you get these?
- Ty Webb.

684
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,800
Ty Webb.

685
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:25,300
I don't know what sleazy deal you made
or what do you intend to do here,

686
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,800
but our members
will never stand for this.

687
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,900
- Most of them can't stand anyway.
- Listen, Chandler.

688
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:34,200
You know what the most important problem
with the world is?

689
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:39,000
Privilege. People like you who somehow
think you're better than everybody else.

690
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,900
Here is a city full of poor people,
poor people who've suffered.

691
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:48,700
Suffered and struggled in the factories
and the slaughterhouses. For what?

692
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:53,300
So that people like you
should live in a mansion on the hill?

693
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,400
Chandler, let me tell you something.

694
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,300
There's gonna be a lot of new faces
in this club.

695
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:03,000
I'm gonna see to it. I'm gonna open
Bushwood Club to the general public.

696
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:10,500
And I'm gonna make sure that everyone...
has a taste... of the good life.

697
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:13,900
Don't you just love this guy?

698
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,600
Don't start thinking
you've won anything!

699
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,200
This isn't over yet.

700
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,400
See you at the reopening.
Hope you like pickled herring.

701
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:26,300
Yeah, come on back any time
and we'll play a few holes.

702
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,600
- Chandler, I want to go home.
- See here, Cynthia,

703
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,800
the last thing we want to do
is let him think he's winning.

704
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,300
But he is winning.

705
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:03,200
Well, it's no different, is it?

706
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,200
Perhaps it won't be so bad after all.

707
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,800
- Gimme that!
- This is outrageous.

708
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,700
I don't want to talk about it,
let's just play.

709
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:34,000
Hey, boys, you made it, huh?

710
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,500
What do you think? Isn't it great?
It's great, isn't it?

711
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:40,600
I suppose this is someone's idea
of having a good time.

712
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,000
What?

713
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,700
Perhaps you can turn the music down,
you idiot.

714
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,700
Oh, yeah, right.

715
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:52,200
What do you say I join you
for a little small ball?

716
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,700
Here, have a pull off of that
if you want.

717
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,100
You've got a driver and a putter.
How can you play with two clubs?

718
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,400
How many do you need?

719
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,200
I can't believe I'm playin' golf, huh?

720
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,800
Golf. Golf.

721
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,900
Sounds like you got something
stuck in your throat.

722
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:25,700
Oh, he really got a hold of that.
That one's in the upper deck.

723
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:27,900
Oh, that one's gone.

724
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,500
Where's my beer?

725
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,900
You know the problem with golf?

726
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,900
It's a game for wusses.
There's no damn contact.

727
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,100
You know what I mean?

728
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:49,200
Wait, wait, wait.
I got an idea. I got an idea, look.

729
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,900
Let's play one on one.

730
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,900
I'll defend the hole
and you try to score.

731
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:58,100
You got helmets, you got pads,
you got your clubs flying around.

732
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:02,300
Throw in a little stiff body checking.
Boom, you got yourself a game.

733
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:06,600
- What do you say?
- Good God.

734
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,800
Well, it was just an idea.

735
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,500
Ho! Where were you?
I've been looking for you all day.

736
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:31,500
I can tell.
Quite an impressive search party.

737
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,100
Ha!

738
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:36,900
Oh, Cynthia. I didn't even see you here.

739
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:41,000
- How are you? How you doin'?
- Do you mind? You're blocking my sun.

740
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,000
Your sun? Your sun?
I'm doing you a favour.

741
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,400
You lay around here your face
will look like an alligator bag.

742
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,200
You're gonna be wearing luggage tags
for earrings.

743
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,000
Really!

744
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,300
I hope you brought your wooden shoes.

745
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,900
It looks good, don't it, huh?
Don't it look great?

746
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:07,000
Yeah, we had a hell of a time
trying to find all these giant tulips.

747
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,300
You got to knock it
right through that little door.

748
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,300
It's hard as hell.

749
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:21,200
All right!

750
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,700
I'm on my game today.
Give it a try.

751
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,700
Hey, Kate!

752
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,700
He seems absolutely thrilled
with the joke he's made out of our club.

753
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:38,500
Miffy, I hardly think Kate wants to hear
our unvarnished opinion on the subject.

754
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:41,300
You don't have
to varnish it for me, Todd.

755
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:44,200
I stopped apologising for my dad
a long time ago.

756
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,800
I admire that, Kate.

757
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:56,400
Hey.
That's a pretty girl over there, huh?

758
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,900
Yes, it is.

759
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:01,300
You'd like to get her alone in the dark?

760
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,500
As long as I've got your permission.

761
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:07,900
What's yourjob here? Yourjob here is
as a lifeguard. That's why I hired you.

762
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,500
I didn't hire you to watch my daughter.

763
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:13,300
- The lives. Lives. You got that?
- Guarding lives.

764
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,600
Every life around this pool
is your responsibility.

765
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,300
- Yes, sir.
- Repeat after me.

766
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,800
- Every... single...
- Every single life...

767
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,100
- You're too fast.
- Every single life...

768
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:26,200
around this pool is your responsibility.

769
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,300
- My responsibility.
- Every life!

770
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,800
- It is my responsibility.
- Every single life.

771
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,700
Except that son of a bitch there.

772
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,300
Girls, now you'll see some sliding.

773
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,700
Get that bastard.

774
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:49,700
Kate! Miffy!

775
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,500
Watch this.

776
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,900
Look out below.

777
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,700
Yeah!

778
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,000
Oh, hot, hot!

779
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,800
Hot! Hot!

780
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
He's such a show-off.

781
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:17,700
Oh! Oh, boy!

782
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,800
Oh, boy! Oh, boy! That's hot! Ow!

783
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,800
Oh, that's... Ow, my ass!

784
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:34,600
That's it. Take him off!

785
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,100
Shoot!

786
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:44,200
Come on, shoot! Come on! Come on, shoot!

787
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,500
Shoot! Come on!

788
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,300
- Will you please move?
- Huh?

789
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,900
Oh. Sorry. Go ahead.

790
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,200
Come on, you got it!

791
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,600
He steals the puck.
He's got it off the ice!

792
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:11,100
Easy! Easy! Easy!

793
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,200
He shoots! He scores!

794
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,200
This is some damn sport,
eh, boys?

795
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:28,300
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Let's go another 18. What do you say?

796
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,200
Chandler Young?

797
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,800
Yes.

798
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,400
Our mutual friend
told me to meet you here.

799
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:55,200
Captain Tom Everett, United States
Marine Corps, Company A, retired.

800
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,700
I was expecting someone with a vehicle,
but not this.

801
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,600
Well, think about it,
your objective is to surveil a target

802
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,300
operating in the construction business.

803
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:09,800
What could be better suited to this sort
of covert recon than a barf wagon?

804
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:15,000
- Order something.
- I'm really not that hungry.

805
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,500
Typical.

806
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:22,900
Might I remind you that sacrifice is
the key to the survival of your country?

807
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,900
Or in this case, your country club.

808
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:28,300
All right,
then give me a cheese sandwich.

809
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,600
Don't have it.

810
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:33,200
I'll have a tuna on wholewheat.

811
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,300
Don't have it.

812
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:40,400
No.
I think you'll be ordering number six.

813
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,000
Fiesta burrito with chilli and eggs.

814
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:47,100
Just exactly what is
your military background?

815
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:50,400
Oh, I had 15 years in.

816
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:54,900
Covert stuff mainly.
Recon, LRRPs, special ops.

817
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:59,800
Yeah. Most of the details
of my assignments are still classified.

818
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,600
I can't go into it without compromising
elements of our foreign policy.

819
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:09,200
But it was mainly demolition work

820
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,900
of an inter-personal nature.

821
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,700
Then there was that damn
bureaucratic snafu in the Nam.

822
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:18,900
I ended up in a VA mental facility.

823
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,900
Typical.

824
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,500
So typical.

825
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:26,200
I can then assume our friend
will be discouraged from involvement

826
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,400
with Bushwood Country Club?

827
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:33,900
Are we talking... discouraged...
with extreme prejudice?

828
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:38,200
I'm afraid we already tried
extreme prejudice. Didn't work.

829
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:42,400
No, no, no, I meant
do you want him... terminated?

830
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:45,200
The less I know about that the better.

831
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,900
Good. That's my policy exactly.

832
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:52,700
That way, when we're captured, and they
put a 12-volt battery to our testicles,

833
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:56,900
which can, does and has happened...

834
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,700
we can honestly say
we're ignorant of the subject.

835
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:04,800
Should we swear a blood oath on it
or something?

836
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,700
Oh, I don't think that will be
necessary, Captain Everett.

837
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,900
OK.

838
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:18,000
From now on, in future communications,
you'll refer to me as... Mr Sanderson.

839
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:22,800
And I will refer to you as erm...
Mrs Esterhaus.

840
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,600
Fine.

841
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:28,100
Well... I guess that's it then.

842
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:32,700
- Oh, Mr Sanderson.
- Goodbye... Mrs Esterhaus.

843
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,100
My God.

844
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,700
- What's the matter?
- You look stunning.

845
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:18,400
Thank you.

846
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,600
Give me a minute. I'll be right back.

847
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,600
Jack?

848
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:36,600
Jack, I'm in the kitchen.

849
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,100
Jackie?

850
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:52,300
I'm just fixing something.

851
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:11,800
Oy!

852
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,500
Jack?

853
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:29,600
Jack, shall I get that?

854
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,500
What are you doing out there?

855
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:39,600
I just wanted to see what it would feel
like to come home to you every night.

856
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:42,100
Oh, how sweet.

857
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:47,100
- Now what were you really up to?
- Me?

858
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:50,600
Nothing. Nothing.
I just wanted to give you a present.

859
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,500
Hello.

860
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:17,000
- What's this? Where you going?
- Going to stay at Miffy's for a while.

861
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,900
Miffy's? Why?

862
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:21,900
Cos I can't live with you anymore.

863
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:25,400
Live with me? What happened?

864
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:29,700
You don't care about me, or you wouldn't
have done what you did to Bushwood.

865
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:33,000
Did to Bushwood?
I made it into a fun place.

866
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:37,400
No, you took a beautiful country club
and turned it into Coney Island.

867
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:41,400
It was perfect the way it was,
but you couldn't stand that, could you?

868
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,900
You had to make it cheap and common.

869
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:48,200
I don't believe this.
You sound just like one of them.

870
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,500
Don't you understand?

871
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:55,300
- I want to be one of them.
- You wanna be one...

872
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:59,300
Then be one of them. Go ahead.
Go ahead, you got no family anymore.

873
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:03,900
- You're now one of them.
- That's fine with me.

874
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,000
Fine with you, fine with them,
and it's fine with me.

875
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,000
Then go ahead.
And don't come back here anymore.

876
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:21,900
- Little bit hard on her, weren't you?
- I was hard on her?

877
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:26,500
I work like a dog all my life
so she should have everything.

878
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:28,900
And she talks to me like that?

879
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:31,300
All kids go through things like that.

880
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:35,300
They're embarrassed about their parents
or they want to be someone else.

881
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,200
I hope you're right.

882
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,500
Just give her a chance. She'll be fine.

883
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,500
Everything is perfect.

884
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:55,300
It's a perfect mess, that's what it is.
My daughter walked out on me.

885
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:59,000
Just when I thought I was
doing it right, I'm doing it all wrong.

886
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:02,300
Just when I think I'm on top
I'm on the bottom again.

887
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:07,800
My daughter was right. No matter how
rich I get I'm a filthy, vulgar person.

888
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,600
That's what I am. That's what I am.

889
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:15,600
I'm trash. I'm filth. I'm dirt.
I'm garbage. I'm the scum of the Earth.

890
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,900
I'm the scum of the Earth!

891
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,500
You can contradict me
any time you want, you know.

892
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:25,100
Hm? No, no, no argument here.

893
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:28,500
I make a point never to interfere
in people's relationships.

894
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:32,300
You know, there's no mystery
to dealing with women.

895
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:36,900
Women are... They're just
human beings like you and me.

896
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,700
They're fragile, they're sensitive,

897
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:45,600
they're responsive to...
kindness and warmth and honesty.

898
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,400
They just have to be treated that way,
that's all.

899
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,500
Let me show you what I'm talking about.

900
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,800
What the... Very funny.

901
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:01,500
- Hi.
- Hi.

902
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:04,900
- I'm Ty Webb.
- We were noticing you at the bar.

903
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,500
Er... want to play trap the clam?

904
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:15,200
- Dip the donkey?
- Excuse me.

905
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,700
Spank the puppy?

906
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,100
Swallow the swan?

907
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:26,700
- I have to put a dime in the meter.
- I'll help you.

908
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,600
Mow the lawn?

909
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,100
Pop the weasel?

910
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:38,500
Well, we're finally alone.

911
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:40,700
I know.

912
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:45,100
Have you ever seen a crisp $50 bill?

913
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:48,900
Urghh!

914
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:30,000
Uh-huh.

915
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,200
Jack, just the man I was looking for.

916
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,200
I just spoke to my friends
at the planning commission.

917
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,700
Here's a little present for you.

918
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:41,800
It'd be a miracle if you ever got
another building permit in this city.

919
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:48,300
You crooks are all on the take. Where
you're taking it I don't want to know.

920
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:51,600
So you might be interested
in selling your Bushwood stock,

921
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,500
at a whopping loss, of course.

922
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:56,400
I'm sick and tired of you
and your bullshit, got that?

923
01:07:56,600 --> 01:08:00,800
- I'm buying you out!
- You're crazy if you think we'll sell.

924
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,400
- Name your price!
- Why don't we flip for it?

925
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:05,700
OK, coin in the air.

926
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:08,200
Coin in the air.

927
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,500
...taking over...

928
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:13,600
Be honest, who had heads?
I'm gonna flip again. Here we go!

929
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,600
It's tails.

930
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,200
- Did you hear me?
- Let me tell you something.

931
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:39,300
OK. You want a fight,
you got yourself a fight.

932
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,800
One more word and I'll kill ya.
One more word!

933
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,900
- Clown.
- That's not the word.

934
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,200
- Barbarian.
- That's not the word either.

935
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:48,300
- Coward.
- That was the word.

936
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:51,800
- That was the word.
- Break it up! Break it up!

937
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:56,500
You want to settle this? Do it
like gentlemen, on the golf course.

938
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:59,900
- 18 holes. Partners.
- Great idea.

939
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:02,200
You win, you can have your club back.

940
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:05,400
He wins, he keeps the club
and he builds those apartments.

941
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,700
- You're on, mister.
- OK, you got a bet. It's on my course.

942
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:12,600
- And no trick clubs.
- Who needs them? You're finished.

943
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:18,700
Out of my way.

944
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Hey.

945
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:29,700
Todd. Go out and get a nice tie.
You look like a Pee-wee Herman doll.

946
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:54,500
Look how uncoordinated he is.
Can't even drive a car.

947
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:57,400
Can you imagine him beating me at golf?

948
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:06,300
Frankly, you're not great yourself.

949
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:09,600
Even with me as your partner
there's still an element of risk.

950
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:13,200
Take my word. Risk has been eliminated.

951
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:23,500
That's my car!

952
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:28,100
Place yourself in my hands.

953
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:30,300
OK, trust me.

954
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,600
Relax. Come on, relax.

955
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,900
All right. Bend your knees just a touch.

956
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:39,900
- You want to spread your legs.
- You want me to leave you alone?

957
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:42,700
That's not funny.
OK, let's see that grip.

958
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,000
No, Jack. Jack.

959
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:49,300
- Terry...
- Harry.

960
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:52,600
- Harry. You're gonna be his partner?
- Yes. 50/50, right?

961
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:57,400
- I don't like you that much. 90/20.
- Close enough.

962
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,000
I want you to swing nice and easy
and hit one down the fairway, OK?

963
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:05,000
Just want to see how you hit it.
Take your time. Nice and easy.

964
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,300
Right down the fairway.
Relax and swing easy.

965
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,800
Don't be afraid. Any time.

966
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:19,600
Just give it a good hit.
Right down the fairway.

967
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,700
Fellas?

968
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,700
No. No. Hold it. Time out.

969
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,500
You're picking your head up.
You got to keep it down. Down.

970
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:37,000
And I noticed you're bending
your left elbow on your back swing.

971
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:39,300
Keep that straight. Use both hands.

972
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,900
Bend your knees a little bit more.
That's it.

973
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:43,900
- It's really quite simple.
- Kevin.

974
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:45,800
- Harry.
- Whatever.

975
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,100
You're just confusing the man.
It's really quite simple.

976
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:51,800
First of all, get rid of all this stuff.

977
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:56,700
What you want to do is clear your mind.

978
01:11:56,900 --> 01:12:00,100
OK? Watch me, OK? Take a deep breath.

979
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:04,700
Close your eyes.

980
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:08,200
And just be the ball.

981
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,700
- Be the ball.
- Be the ball.

982
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:14,000
Be the ball.

983
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:17,500
- Na-na-na-na-na.
- Na-na-na-na-na.

984
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:21,500
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.
Na-na-na-na-na.

985
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,600
- Be the ball.
- Be the ball.

986
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:28,400
Be the ball. Be the ball. Be the ball.

987
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:31,300
- Be the ball.
- Na-na-na-na-na.

988
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,600
- Na-na-na-na-na.
- Na-na-na-na-na.

989
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:37,200
- Na-na-na-na-na.
- Na-na-na-na-na.

990
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:38,900
Na-na-na-na-na.

991
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:42,500
No, no, no, no, no. Jack. Jack. Jack!

992
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:45,100
Jack! You're not being the ball.
Be the ball.

993
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:47,100
Do me a favour, you be the ball.

994
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:50,600
If I wanted to be sports equipment
I'd be a lady's bicycle seat.

995
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:58,000
Tell you what,
the problem is concentration.

996
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,600
Why don't we try it blindfolded?

997
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:04,200
- Why not?
- All right, let's try that.

998
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:15,800
Jack, we tried the spiritual approach
and it didn't work. It's not your fault.

999
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,600
But this is the latest biomechanic,
ergonomic, kinaesthetic,

1000
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,800
state-of-the-art teaching technique.
You'll like it.

1001
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,200
Get rid of that wicked slice.
Let's try it.

1002
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,200
OK, let's try one.

1003
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:37,300
That's getting better.

1004
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:44,100
Perfect!

1005
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:02,800
- Good morning, Mrs Esterhaus.
- Don't "Mrs Esterhaus" me, you idiot.

1006
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:05,500
You blew up my Rolls-Royce.

1007
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:13,400
It's difficult. In my line of work you
learn it's the details that kill you.

1008
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,700
Just make sure that next time
there aren't any screw-ups.

1009
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,900
I'm playing this man in a golf match
and I don't intend to lose.

1010
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:23,200
You won't.

1011
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:39,600
OK. These are six mercury-filled,
steel-jacketed dum-dum golf balls.

1012
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,300
Feel the weight on this little sweetie.

1013
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,600
This is a high-tensile strength
titanium driver,

1014
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:52,200
which in the hands
of a trained professional

1015
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,300
will definitely redefine
the term "handicap".

1016
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:58,100
Oh, yeah, look in the eyepiece.

1017
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:00,000
Go ahead. Feel free.

1018
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:03,900
I've set up a simulation. See?
Watermelon hanging from those gallows.

1019
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:05,500
Yes.

1020
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:09,800
Let's just say that that watermelon
represents the head of your problem.

1021
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,600
All right?

1022
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,000
OK.

1023
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,000
Now, sir, if you would please...

1024
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,900
keep your eye on the fruit.

1025
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:29,200
Keep your eye on the fruit.

1026
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:35,100
Keep your eye on the fruit.

1027
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,500
- Good.
- Good?

1028
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:41,700
- Good.
- Good?

1029
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:45,600
It's better than good. It's gone.

1030
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:48,400
Now, listen,
I want to be very clear about this.

1031
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:51,100
Follow the match closely,
but stay out of sight.

1032
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,400
Do nothing, unless you my signal.

1033
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,400
OK.

1034
01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:00,400
But should my opponent start to win
I will tip my cap.

1035
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:04,300
Speaking of tipping, there is the
as yet unattended to matter of my fee.

1036
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:08,700
- I'd like it deposited there, please.
- What's this? A Swiss bank account?

1037
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:12,200
It's the combination of my locker
at the Greyhound bus station.

1038
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,400
How elegant.

1039
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:22,600
I hope this is the last time we have
to meet like this, Mr Sanderson.

1040
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:26,600
My sentiments exactly, Mrs Esterhaus.

1041
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,500
Ladies and gentlemen,

1042
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:40,700
let's get ready to rumble.

1043
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,300
Gentlemen,
these are the rules of the match.

1044
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:47,000
It's a Scotch twosome. Each partner
hits the other partner's ball.

1045
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:49,900
For those of you unfamiliar
with this type of play,

1046
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:53,900
it's a little like tag-team wrestling.
Only you can't do this.

1047
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:57,300
None of this. Or this.

1048
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:02,500
Now, fewest strokes wins the hole.
Most holes wins the match.

1049
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:05,000
- Fine.
- Australian winter rules.

1050
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:09,700
You may improve your lie in the rough if
you can roughly prove you're not lying.

1051
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:12,400
If your ball goes in the water
you may go in after it,

1052
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:15,200
but only if it's been 45 minutes
since you last ate.

1053
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:18,000
- Are you quite finished?
- Not quite, no.

1054
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:21,600
- Largest shoe size has the honour.
- Anybody beat a 12D?

1055
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:25,800
- I can, but I'm out of this.
- So?

1056
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:28,000
- So I guess you're up.
- OK.

1057
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:29,900
May the best man win.

1058
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:33,600
And if that doesn't happen,
I hope Jack and Harry pull this off.

1059
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:37,100
Wish I could stay, but I got a thing.
Bye.

1060
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:40,800
- Knock 'em dead, Harry.
- Come on, Harry.

1061
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,400
Straighten up!

1062
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:47,400
Yeah!

1063
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:55,100
If you have to have a partner
you're the partner to have.

1064
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:57,400
Great.

1065
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:05,900
These clubs are terrible!

1066
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,700
Here we go.

1067
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:22,700
I know. I know! Be the ball.

1068
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:25,500
Be the ball. Be the ball.

1069
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:27,700
Swing for the fences.

1070
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,100
He's sliced it.
Stay out of the woods.

1071
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,400
Stay out of the woods!

1072
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,700
- Stay out.
- Look out!

1073
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:54,100
There's my objective.

1074
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:57,900
He's no threat. Nice duds though.

1075
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:00,100
Sure hate to mess 'em up.

1076
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:03,600
This is gonna be an easy one.

1077
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:07,300
One quick stroke,
I'll bounce him and be out by sundown.

1078
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:11,900
Easiest money I ever made.

1079
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:15,100
Hmm. How the hell
am I supposed to concentrate

1080
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:17,400
with smurf like that walking around?

1081
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:22,100
You did that on purpose.

1082
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:24,600
Naughty! Naughty!

1083
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:29,100
I may have to put you in the duck suit,
and your little dog, too.

1084
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:31,500
Ah-ha!

1085
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:35,600
Hey! Hey! Who the hell sent you.
You little subversive vermin.

1086
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:43,900
Whoo! Whoo! Legal matter coming through.

1087
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:47,200
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
You getting the shit kicked out of ya?

1088
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,000
How's it goin'?

1089
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Terrible. I'm hungry
and have to go to the bathroom.

1090
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,500
No, I mean the game. What's the score?

1091
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:01,800
Ah, we're losing.
They're six holes ahead.

1092
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,200
I was starting to get used
to country club life.

1093
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:12,800
What do you say
we try something different? Come here.

1094
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
But the green is over there.

1095
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:18,400
You have the worst slice
in the history of golf.

1096
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,600
Might as well go with it.

1097
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,900
Ha-ha!

1098
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:43,400
- See that?
- Thank you. Thank you.

1099
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,200
And I thought this was a hard game.

1100
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:51,700
I got you now, you little furry freak.

1101
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:55,900
You're not going to get away from me.

1102
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:59,400
Scrambling around.
I know you're in there.

1103
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:04,300
He's close.

1104
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:09,000
You're close, aren't ya?
Just a few feet away.

1105
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,400
Mocking me.

1106
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:15,200
Ain't a gopher alive
that's a match for an ex-Marine.

1107
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:19,400
- Shh!
- Here we go.

1108
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,800
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Yes!

1109
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:34,200
Chandler, what's going on? You were up
seven holes, now he's won the last six.

1110
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:37,900
- You promised he couldn't win.
- He can't win if he doesn't finish.

1111
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:17,100
- Harry. Hi.
- Is your dad gonna be happy to see you.

1112
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:19,100
Yeah. How's the match going?

1113
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:21,700
It's all tied up
with this last hole to go.

1114
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:24,800
- Do you think you can win?
- We got the momentum.

1115
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Yeah. Yeah, I think we're gonna win.

1116
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:39,000
OK, little gopher. Hey.

1117
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:41,300
It's your friend Tom.

1118
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,500
I gotjunk food.

1119
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:47,900
Everybody loves mass-produced
cream-filled pastries.

1120
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:50,000
They're good.

1121
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:52,700
I was just trying
to get your attention before.

1122
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,700
Come on.

1123
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:58,400
They're good. Huh?

1124
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,600
Very subtle, Mrs Esterhaus.

1125
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:13,100
I read ya, loud and clear.

1126
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:25,400
Whoo!

1127
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:29,200
That hurts.

1128
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:33,500
I think it was a big mistake
tipping that arrow head with poison.

1129
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:40,700
- Don't hit it long.
- Gotcha.

1130
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:44,100
No, no, wait. Don't hit it short.

1131
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:47,400
OK, right in the middle there
is where I want to go.

1132
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:50,100
Wait, hit it long but let it go short.

1133
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:54,100
Well, it's not long.

1134
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:56,600
But it's short.

1135
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

1136
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,100
You...

1137
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,400
Come on, hit me. Huh? Come on, hit me.

1138
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:15,200
Come on, hit me!

1139
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:17,500
Nya! What's up, doc?

1140
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:39,400
Seems that cream
always rises to the top,

1141
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,600
doesn't it, bag boy?

1142
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:49,800
Well, girls, once we win this hole
this place will be back to normal.

1143
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,800
Kate, we might even be able to make it
in time for Bunny's brunch.

1144
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,900
Would you excuse me?

1145
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,700
Kate, I've decided that
you mustjoin my sorority.

1146
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:03,800
And I know that the Kappas
are just going to love you.

1147
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:09,200
There's only one thing? Would you
consider changing your name?

1148
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:13,400
Maybe take out the "ounian" and shorten
it to Kate Hart. Isn't that great?

1149
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:17,300
Wait a second.
What is wrong with my real name?

1150
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:20,700
Nothing. It's just that it sounds so...

1151
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:22,500
So what?

1152
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:26,700
Kate, you want people
to think that you belong.

1153
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:29,600
I do belong... to a family.

1154
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:34,300
Well... if you want
my honest opinion, Kate,

1155
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:37,300
I think that your family's
really embarrassing.

1156
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:40,400
And I'm really happy
that I'm not a part of it.

1157
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:43,100
Yeah, so am I.

1158
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:45,700
What? What?

1159
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:51,800
Miffy, you are a stupid,
superficial, snotty little bitch.

1160
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:55,200
Oh, really? Really, Kate? Oh!

1161
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:58,900
Whatever! What... Ow!

1162
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:11,200
Well, Jack,
I guess it's come down to this.

1163
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:14,300
Whoever sinks their putt wins the match.

1164
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:17,100
Frankly, I'm not worried.

1165
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:19,700
Chandler, could I talk to you
for a moment?

1166
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,200
Look, I don't know much about golf,

1167
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:28,600
but I do know the difference between
a 50-foot putt and a two-foot putt.

1168
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:35,000
It's always been my experience
to go with the guy closer to the hole.

1169
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:39,100
- You're my kind of guy.
- Thank you.

1170
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:43,700
- Can I give you some friendly advice?
- Yeah, all right.

1171
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,300
- Have you tried putting with a wedgie?
- A wedgie?

1172
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:50,800
Yeah. Oh, it's great.
All the pros are doing it.

1173
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,100
- Would you like me to show you?
- Yeah.

1174
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:58,300
See, what you do is you take your normal
stance, like you're putting the ball.

1175
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:01,100
Just like that.
You never putted with a wedgie?

1176
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:04,100
- No.
- You just take your stance.

1177
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:07,400
And then... this is the wedgie!

1178
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:13,300
Try putting with that
crammed up your crack.

1179
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,800
Pop?

1180
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,300
Pop.

1181
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:30,500
I just wanted to say that
whether or not you sink this putt...

1182
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:34,400
I love you.

1183
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:37,600
I'm really sorry I've been acting
like such a jerk lately.

1184
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:42,800
I guess that's what I get
for hanging round a bunch of fonzanoons.

1185
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,900
I don't know what you thought.

1186
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:49,200
Did you think you'd just walk out on me,
insult me, come back when you want?

1187
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:54,100
Put your arms around me, tell me
"I love you" and I'll forget everything?

1188
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:56,300
Yeah, that's the general idea.

1189
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,100
You're right.

1190
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,700
Ah-hah.

1191
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:35,500
Sink your putt.

1192
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:43,700
Now. Do it now. Now.

1193
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:56,100
Now! Now!

1194
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:04,800
- You can do it.
- Do it.

1195
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,300
Now. Do it now.

1196
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:12,600
Do it.

1197
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,600
No!

1198
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,700
Shh! He still might sink his putt.

1199
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:53,100
If he does, we tie.

1200
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:11,100
Father, a word.

1201
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:16,900
This putt is very simple
and very straight.

1202
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:19,300
Just tap it.

1203
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:23,900
- Tap it.
- Just tap it.

1204
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:27,000
A tiny, tiny tap.

1205
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:31,200
- Tiny tap.
- A tiny, tiny, tiny tap.

1206
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:53,000
- Lost ball, wouldn't you say?
- We win, you lose.

1207
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:59,300
Hey, Chandler, nice touch.

1208
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:05,100
Excuse me, Mr Something.

1209
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:12,000
Might I trouble you for a scalpel, some
forceps or maybe even a pair of pliers?

1210
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:16,400
You see, I had a little trouble
getting out of the roughs over there

1211
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:19,900
and damn if I didn't
accidentally shoot myself

1212
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:23,200
with a poison-tipped crossbow dart.

1213
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,900
If I pull the arrow out,

1214
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:31,600
will you please
suck out the poison for me?

1215
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:37,100
Let me get this straight.

1216
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:40,000
You pull it out, I suck?

1217
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:45,500
Is there any money in it for me?

1218
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:48,400
Oh, tough course.

1219
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:50,500
It was a tiny tap.

1220
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:53,300
Look at you,
you've burned your sweater.

1221
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:59,800
Mother, how could you marry a man
with such a terrible short game?

1222
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:02,100
Oh, shut up, Mary Frances.

1223
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:05,400
Spoiled, snotty,
superficial little bitch.

1224
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:07,600
What?

1225
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:10,100
Todd. Todd.

1226
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:15,900
Oh, drat, I guess this means
you won't be going to Bunny's brunch?

1227
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:40,000
Hey, baby.

1228
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:51,800
Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!
