1
00:00:29,743 --> 00:00:31,677
I hate television.

2
00:00:31,712 --> 00:00:33,009
Gives me headaches.

3
00:00:33,046 --> 00:00:34,104
...makes your

4
00:00:34,147 --> 00:00:35,011
color-treated hair...

5
00:00:35,048 --> 00:00:36,242
You know, I heard there's

6
00:00:36,283 --> 00:00:38,877
so many magnetic waves traveling
through the air

7
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:42,286
because of TV and telephones,
that we're losing, like

8
00:00:42,322 --> 00:00:45,416
ten times as many brain cells
as we're supposed to.

9
00:00:45,459 --> 00:00:48,223
Like, all the molecules
in our heads are all unstable.

10
00:00:48,261 --> 00:00:49,819
All the companies know
about it

11
00:00:49,863 --> 00:00:51,660
but they're not
doing anything about it.

12
00:00:51,698 --> 00:00:54,292
It's, like, a big conspiracy.

13
00:00:54,368 --> 00:00:56,302
You can pick something.

14
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,860
I don't care.

15
00:00:57,904 --> 00:00:59,804
Say hello to luscious,
full bod...

16
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:03,441
You have any idea
how many electro-rays

17
00:01:03,477 --> 00:01:06,446
are traveling
through our head every second?

18
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,447
I got a better one.

19
00:01:08,148 --> 00:01:09,672
Have you heard about
this videotape

20
00:01:09,716 --> 00:01:11,479
that kills you
when you watch it?

21
00:01:12,018 --> 00:01:13,212
What kind of tape?

22
00:01:13,253 --> 00:01:15,483
A tape, a regular tape.

23
00:01:15,522 --> 00:01:16,853
People rent it, I don't know.

24
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,187
You start to play it

25
00:01:18,225 --> 00:01:20,955
and it's, like,
somebody's nightmare.

26
00:01:20,994 --> 00:01:24,430
Then suddenly,
this woman comes on

27
00:01:24,464 --> 00:01:26,728
smiling at you, right?

28
00:01:26,767 --> 00:01:29,964
Seeing you through the screen...

29
00:01:30,003 --> 00:01:32,699
and as soon as
it's over...

30
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:34,502
your phone rings.

31
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:37,635
Someone knows
you've watched it

32
00:01:37,677 --> 00:01:40,202
and what they say is...

33
00:01:40,247 --> 00:01:43,512
''You will die
in seven days''

34
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,518
and exactly seven
days later...

35
00:01:47,053 --> 00:01:48,020
Who told you that?

36
00:01:48,054 --> 00:01:49,817
Somebody from Revere.
I don't...

37
00:01:49,856 --> 00:01:51,153
Who told you?

38
00:01:51,191 --> 00:01:53,250
What's your problem?

39
00:01:53,293 --> 00:01:56,490
I've watched it.

40
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,657
It's a story, Katie.

41
00:01:58,698 --> 00:02:00,529
No, me and Josh,
we saw it last weekend.

42
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:01,693
I thought you were
with your parents.

43
00:02:01,735 --> 00:02:02,861
I wanted to tell you.

44
00:02:02,903 --> 00:02:04,029
You were with
Josh all weekend?

45
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,697
Some of his friends
got this-this place

46
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:06,706
up in the mountains.

47
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,731
They were trying
to record a football game.

48
00:02:08,775 --> 00:02:10,402
I guess the reception
was so bad...

49
00:02:10,444 --> 00:02:11,433
What are you talking about?

50
00:02:11,478 --> 00:02:12,445
Listen to me!

51
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,845
When we played the tape,
the game wasn't there.

52
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:17,611
It was...

53
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:19,278
What?

54
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,911
Wh-What was it?

55
00:02:20,954 --> 00:02:23,946
It was something else.

56
00:02:26,526 --> 00:02:30,223
We thought it was
some kind of sick joke...

57
00:02:30,263 --> 00:02:32,390
and then the phone rang.

58
00:02:34,734 --> 00:02:36,702
It was a week ago...

59
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:40,832
one week ago tonight.

60
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:45,174
You're just trying to scare me.

61
00:02:54,354 --> 00:02:56,413
Oh, my God, Katie!

62
00:02:56,523 --> 00:02:58,150
Are you okay?

63
00:02:58,191 --> 00:02:59,419
Katie... oh, my...

64
00:03:00,527 --> 00:03:02,961
You freak!

65
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:04,964
You totally fell for it!

66
00:03:04,998 --> 00:03:06,659
No.

67
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,137
So... did you guys,
you know, do anything?

68
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:14,368
Like what?

69
00:03:14,407 --> 00:03:17,035
Oh, my God, you totally did!

70
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:18,305
You ho!

71
00:03:18,345 --> 00:03:19,573
Tell me now!

72
00:03:36,363 --> 00:03:38,991
There really is a tape?

73
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:03,686
This is so lame.

74
00:04:03,723 --> 00:04:04,849
Wait, don't!

75
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:06,859
Embrey residence.

76
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:28,043
Hello.

77
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:30,049
Hi, Mom.

78
00:04:32,052 --> 00:04:33,178
Yeah, that was Becca.

79
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:34,345
My mom says hi.

80
00:04:34,387 --> 00:04:35,513
She's glad you're here.

81
00:04:35,555 --> 00:04:37,682
Ask her where she keeps
the Vicodin.

82
00:04:38,892 --> 00:04:40,860
Yeah, we're about
to go to sleep.

83
00:04:40,894 --> 00:04:44,022
Okay. Yeah, I will.

84
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:48,160
Okay! Okay, yeah, yeah, I will.

85
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:51,170
No, I won't.

86
00:04:51,204 --> 00:04:52,501
Bye, Mom.

87
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:19,825
Becca, quit being a bitch.

88
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:21,356
Where's the remote?

89
00:05:46,693 --> 00:05:48,593
Becca, quit it!

90
00:06:46,553 --> 00:06:49,488
Becca, can you hear me?

91
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:50,444
Don't tell me what to write!

92
00:07:50,483 --> 00:07:52,610
That asshole's screaming
for my attention

93
00:07:52,652 --> 00:07:54,882
and I'm not going
to give it to him.

94
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:56,286
I am being objective!

95
00:07:56,322 --> 00:07:58,381
Listen, Harvey,
you punctilious prick

96
00:07:58,424 --> 00:07:59,516
you touch my column

97
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:02,357
and I'm coming down there
and poking your eye out

98
00:08:02,395 --> 00:08:04,955
with that little red pencil
you like so much!

99
00:08:04,998 --> 00:08:06,260
Harvey?

100
00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:07,960
Shit!

101
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:12,961
Hey...

102
00:08:13,006 --> 00:08:15,304
Hey.

103
00:08:15,341 --> 00:08:17,138
Sorry I'm late.

104
00:08:17,177 --> 00:08:19,145
No worries.

105
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:21,170
I'll wait in the car.

106
00:08:23,183 --> 00:08:25,583
Have you got a moment,
Ms. Keller?

107
00:08:25,618 --> 00:08:26,744
Um, sure.

108
00:08:26,786 --> 00:08:28,253
Call me Rachel.

109
00:08:28,288 --> 00:08:29,880
Please, sit down.

110
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:32,619
He certainly is
very independent, isn't he?

111
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,126
Oh, yeah, he sure is.

112
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,355
I never have to tell him
to do anything.

113
00:08:36,396 --> 00:08:37,761
Well, if that's a problem

114
00:08:37,831 --> 00:08:40,493
you'd be the first teacher
in history to say so.

115
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:42,501
Ms. Keller...

116
00:08:42,535 --> 00:08:43,297
Rachel.

117
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,297
I know that Aidan recently lost

118
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:47,431
his cousin...

119
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:48,667
Yes, and I'm doing what I can

120
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,505
to find him some good
daycare. It's just...

121
00:08:50,543 --> 00:08:51,874
Oh, no,
that's not what I meant.

122
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:53,105
By all means, take your time.

123
00:08:53,146 --> 00:08:55,808
I know they were very close,
Aidan and his cousin.

124
00:08:55,849 --> 00:08:58,409
Yeah. They spent a few
nights a week together.

125
00:08:58,451 --> 00:09:00,783
Did he talk to you
about her death?

126
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,256
Well, like you said, he's
not the talkative type.

127
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,952
That doesn't mean
he has nothing to say.

128
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:11,490
He knows I'm there.

129
00:09:11,531 --> 00:09:13,999
Yes, I'm sure he does

130
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:18,299
but he may be expressing himself
in... other ways.

131
00:09:18,338 --> 00:09:21,068
I'd like to show you something.

132
00:09:31,351 --> 00:09:33,751
That's his cousin.

133
00:09:33,786 --> 00:09:35,413
That's Katie.

134
00:09:35,455 --> 00:09:39,516
Ms. Keller...
I'm bothered by these drawings.

135
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:45,355
Listen, I appreciate
your concern

136
00:09:45,398 --> 00:09:48,834
but my son lost his best
friend three nights ago.

137
00:09:48,868 --> 00:09:50,802
He's just trying
to deal with it.

138
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:53,203
Yes, I understand,
but these pictures...

139
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:54,831
Are Aidan's way
of working it out...

140
00:09:54,941 --> 00:09:56,636
of expressing himself,
like you said.

141
00:09:58,344 --> 00:10:00,835
He'll be okay.

142
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:05,645
You say she died
three nights ago?

143
00:10:05,685 --> 00:10:07,152
Yeah, that's right.

144
00:10:07,186 --> 00:10:10,349
Aidan drew these last week.

145
00:10:35,181 --> 00:10:37,274
What?

146
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:40,016
Nothing.

147
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:51,096
Shall we read something?

148
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,654
I'm kind of tired.

149
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:53,825
Okay.

150
00:10:56,002 --> 00:10:57,299
Sweet dreams.

151
00:10:59,906 --> 00:11:01,897
We don't have enough time.

152
00:11:04,544 --> 00:11:07,172
Oh, honey,
I know I've been working a lot

153
00:11:07,213 --> 00:11:08,271
and I'm sorry

154
00:11:08,314 --> 00:11:11,340
but I promise you,
I'm going to make it up to you.

155
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:13,545
I'm not talking about that.

156
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:16,714
I'm talking about
time before we die.

157
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:20,192
You have lots of time.

158
00:11:20,226 --> 00:11:22,694
So, you know when I'm going
to die?

159
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:23,696
No.

160
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,197
No one does

161
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:28,223
but I know you don't have
to worry about it.

162
00:11:29,736 --> 00:11:30,930
Katie knew.

163
00:11:31,037 --> 00:11:32,436
She told me.

164
00:11:32,472 --> 00:11:35,032
Katie told you she was going
to die?

165
00:11:35,074 --> 00:11:37,770
She said she didn't
have enough time.

166
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:42,906
Good night, Rachel.

167
00:11:59,932 --> 00:12:02,400
Oh, shit!

168
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:07,298
Aidan...

169
00:12:09,175 --> 00:12:10,369
Goddamn it!

170
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,707
Honey?!

171
00:12:11,744 --> 00:12:14,804
Have you seen my black dress?

172
00:12:14,847 --> 00:12:16,838
Aidan?

173
00:12:16,883 --> 00:12:19,215
Have you seen my black...

174
00:12:19,252 --> 00:12:21,243
dress?

175
00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:25,952
It's a little wrinkled.

176
00:12:31,264 --> 00:12:32,925
It's fine.

177
00:13:12,972 --> 00:13:14,633
Yeah. Thank you.

178
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:43,001
Kids don't have strokes...

179
00:13:43,035 --> 00:13:44,969
unless they're on drugs.

180
00:13:45,004 --> 00:13:47,336
So, then,
why the closed coffin?

181
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:53,579
Oh, Ruthie.

182
00:13:53,613 --> 00:13:56,241
I'm so sorry.

183
00:14:05,558 --> 00:14:07,526
You all right, Dave?

184
00:14:09,562 --> 00:14:12,463
Yeah, I'm fine.

185
00:14:12,498 --> 00:14:14,864
How are you?

186
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:26,500
He sleeps all day.

187
00:14:26,546 --> 00:14:27,843
He doesn't move.

188
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:32,074
It's too much for him.

189
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:37,351
It doesn't make
any sense, Rachel.

190
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,984
I spent four hours
on the Internet

191
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:42,620
and I couldn't find
one single case

192
00:14:42,662 --> 00:14:46,063
of a 16-year-old girl's
heart just stopping.

193
00:14:46,098 --> 00:14:49,499
I spoke to three different
doctors and not one of them

194
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:54,097
could tell me exactly what
happened to my daughter.

195
00:14:58,211 --> 00:15:02,147
She was close... with you.

196
00:15:02,215 --> 00:15:03,842
And Aidan.

197
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:06,511
But she confided in you.

198
00:15:06,552 --> 00:15:09,020
Yeah, but she never
said anything...

199
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,922
nothing that would explain
what happened.

200
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,017
But you could find out.

201
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,551
It's what you do, isn't it--

202
00:15:16,596 --> 00:15:18,086
ask questions?

203
00:15:20,132 --> 00:15:22,464
Rachel, please.

204
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:29,297
I saw her face.

205
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:41,286
I knew Becca.

206
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,811
I mean, she was a little
intense, but she wasn't crazy.

207
00:15:43,856 --> 00:15:45,824
They don't put you in booties
and a straightjacket

208
00:15:45,858 --> 00:15:47,519
if you're just freaked out.

209
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,757
Something scared the shit
out of her.

210
00:15:50,796 --> 00:15:52,024
Hi.

211
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,901
So, who's
in the mental hospital?

212
00:15:57,103 --> 00:15:58,400
Becca...

213
00:15:58,604 --> 00:16:00,071
Katie's friend.

214
00:16:00,106 --> 00:16:01,596
Oh, right.
She was the one who was...

215
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:03,973
There when it happened.

216
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,673
So, what do you think
they were doing up there?

217
00:16:09,348 --> 00:16:11,612
Oh, thanks.

218
00:16:11,651 --> 00:16:13,710
I remember I was that age.

219
00:16:13,753 --> 00:16:15,983
Me and my girlfriend used to

220
00:16:16,022 --> 00:16:18,217
sneak up to my room, get high.

221
00:16:18,324 --> 00:16:20,986
Do you think maybe
she was into...?

222
00:16:21,027 --> 00:16:22,494
It's not about that.

223
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:25,429
It's about the tape.

224
00:16:25,464 --> 00:16:27,091
Kellen, don't even.

225
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:28,600
What tape?

226
00:16:28,634 --> 00:16:30,659
The one that kills you
when you watch it.

227
00:16:30,703 --> 00:16:32,227
Oh, please.

228
00:16:32,338 --> 00:16:34,898
What was on the tape?

229
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,840
I haven't seen it, obviously.

230
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:38,537
But Katie told you

231
00:16:38,577 --> 00:16:39,805
she saw this tape?

232
00:16:39,845 --> 00:16:41,335
Not Katie.

233
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,678
I heard it from her boyf...

234
00:16:43,716 --> 00:16:45,377
You heard it from who?

235
00:16:45,418 --> 00:16:48,615
She was dating
this guy Josh.

236
00:16:48,654 --> 00:16:49,985
He goes to Revere.

237
00:16:50,022 --> 00:16:51,990
It was kind
of a secret.

238
00:16:52,024 --> 00:16:53,150
Kind of?

239
00:16:53,192 --> 00:16:55,251
Where is he-- Josh?
Is-Is he here?

240
00:16:55,294 --> 00:16:56,352
Josh is dead.

241
00:16:56,395 --> 00:16:58,829
What?

242
00:16:58,864 --> 00:17:00,923
What happened?

243
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:03,366
Supposedly, he killed himself...

244
00:17:03,402 --> 00:17:05,836
the same night that Katie died.

245
00:18:28,254 --> 00:18:32,054
Aidan... what are
you doing in here?

246
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:35,356
Come on.

247
00:18:35,394 --> 00:18:37,692
We shouldn't be in her room.

248
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,994
It's not her room anymore.

249
00:20:17,696 --> 00:20:19,687
10:00 p.m.

250
00:20:37,449 --> 00:20:40,850
10:00 p.m.

251
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,585
Time of death, Wade

252
00:20:43,622 --> 00:20:45,249
that's all I want to know.

253
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,724
The name's Katie Embrey.

254
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:48,920
Pull the report
and read the time.

255
00:20:48,961 --> 00:20:51,930
No, that's okay. I'll hold.

256
00:20:51,964 --> 00:20:54,899
''Punctilious prick''?

257
00:20:54,934 --> 00:20:56,401
Nice alliteration, huh?

258
00:20:56,435 --> 00:20:57,561
You're fired.

259
00:20:57,603 --> 00:20:58,570
No, I'm not.

260
00:20:58,604 --> 00:20:59,662
Yes, you are.

261
00:20:59,705 --> 00:21:01,297
No, I'm not.

262
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,173
I'm cooking too good a story.

263
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:05,801
What is it?

264
00:21:05,844 --> 00:21:07,505
Yeah, I'm still here.

265
00:21:09,348 --> 00:21:10,679
Shh!

266
00:21:13,686 --> 00:21:16,018
Okay, so what's
the time of death?

267
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,734
Hi. I was wondering...

268
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:06,135
Pick a card, any card.

269
00:22:06,171 --> 00:22:07,832
Go ahead.

270
00:22:07,873 --> 00:22:10,501
Okay, put it back.

271
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:12,601
Don't let me see it.

272
00:22:17,683 --> 00:22:19,116
That your card?

273
00:22:19,151 --> 00:22:20,584
No.

274
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:23,588
Damn.

275
00:22:23,622 --> 00:22:25,214
I was wondering
if you'd remember someone

276
00:22:25,257 --> 00:22:26,224
from a week ago.

277
00:22:26,258 --> 00:22:28,192
Was there a problem?

278
00:22:28,227 --> 00:22:29,592
It's my niece.

279
00:22:29,662 --> 00:22:31,721
She sort of ran out

280
00:22:31,764 --> 00:22:33,254
on her parents.

281
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:35,095
No.

282
00:22:35,134 --> 00:22:36,533
I have some photos here.

283
00:22:36,568 --> 00:22:38,900
That's her and her friends.

284
00:22:38,937 --> 00:22:40,598
I think they stayed
here a night or so.

285
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:42,869
Yeah, they were in Cabin 12.

286
00:22:42,908 --> 00:22:46,071
They didn't pay.

287
00:22:46,111 --> 00:22:49,774
Had a number of complaints,
about the TV, mainly.

288
00:22:49,815 --> 00:22:52,340
Uh, reception's never good here.

289
00:22:52,384 --> 00:22:53,942
That's why we bought

290
00:22:53,986 --> 00:22:56,614
tape players for videos.

291
00:22:56,722 --> 00:22:59,020
Quite a selection.

292
00:23:01,293 --> 00:23:02,624
Mostly they're hand-me-downs

293
00:23:02,695 --> 00:23:03,821
left by other guests.

294
00:23:03,862 --> 00:23:07,491
Anyway, they didn't pay.

295
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:09,967
And kids like that
sometimes don't.

296
00:23:10,002 --> 00:23:11,560
Miss?

297
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:13,298
You know, I'm kind of tired.

298
00:23:13,338 --> 00:23:16,307
I'm thinking I might take a nap
before I drive back.

299
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:19,272
I'll take Cabin 12.

300
00:23:32,091 --> 00:23:32,989
Hey.

301
00:23:34,393 --> 00:23:37,089
This is your card, right?

302
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:41,664
That's it.

303
00:26:30,535 --> 00:26:33,129
Seven days.

304
00:27:02,467 --> 00:27:04,958
I'm going to school.

305
00:27:17,816 --> 00:27:20,284
Hold up.

306
00:27:41,573 --> 00:27:43,200
What do you think?

307
00:27:43,241 --> 00:27:45,641
Well, it's a pretty cool effect.

308
00:27:45,677 --> 00:27:50,546
What does this have to do
with the tape?

309
00:27:50,582 --> 00:27:53,745
Take my picture.

310
00:27:58,123 --> 00:27:59,590
Are you going to look at me

311
00:27:59,624 --> 00:28:01,819
at least?

312
00:28:06,865 --> 00:28:08,526
This the same camera?

313
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:11,468
No. Scan the rest.

314
00:28:15,173 --> 00:28:17,004
So, what do you think?

315
00:28:20,345 --> 00:28:22,939
Well, look, I thought you said
this was about a tape.

316
00:28:30,255 --> 00:28:32,280
I'm thinking maybe
you shouldn't see it.

317
00:28:33,492 --> 00:28:36,120
No, I should know
more about it first.

318
00:28:36,161 --> 00:28:38,095
Well, isn't that why I'm here?

319
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:40,394
So you can benefit
from my wisdom?

320
00:28:40,432 --> 00:28:42,127
Four kids are dead, Noah.

321
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:45,500
Not from watching a videotape.

322
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,268
Come on, show it to me.

323
00:30:05,283 --> 00:30:06,773
Roll credits.

324
00:30:06,818 --> 00:30:10,151
That was very student film.

325
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:15,324
I'm sure it's a lot...
scarier at night.

326
00:30:22,234 --> 00:30:24,634
You going to get that?

327
00:30:44,022 --> 00:30:45,319
So, you been working a lot?

328
00:30:45,357 --> 00:30:47,655
I'm not tired, Noah.

329
00:30:47,692 --> 00:30:48,989
Okay.

330
00:30:49,027 --> 00:30:51,325
That tape didn't scare you?

331
00:30:51,363 --> 00:30:52,830
No, not really. Sorry.

332
00:30:52,864 --> 00:30:53,888
Four people are dead.

333
00:30:53,932 --> 00:30:56,025
Yeah, but like I said,
not from watching...

334
00:30:56,067 --> 00:30:57,329
Four people who watched it.

335
00:30:57,369 --> 00:30:58,529
Come on, we watched it.

336
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,537
We're hanging.

337
00:30:59,571 --> 00:31:01,698
It... takes a week.

338
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,868
Right. Yeah, I'm just
going to go downtown.

339
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,537
I got to pick up some
cameras from this guy

340
00:31:06,578 --> 00:31:07,670
and then I got
to prep this thing

341
00:31:07,712 --> 00:31:08,906
that I may end up
doing next week.

342
00:31:08,947 --> 00:31:10,107
--Noah...
--Hmm?

343
00:31:10,148 --> 00:31:12,582
Would you say that I'm gullible?

344
00:31:12,617 --> 00:31:13,709
No.

345
00:31:13,752 --> 00:31:14,719
Easily rattled?

346
00:31:14,753 --> 00:31:15,777
Definitely not.

347
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,912
I mean, you're a little

348
00:31:16,955 --> 00:31:18,582
highly strung maybe.

349
00:31:18,623 --> 00:31:20,716
And you ain't much
of a dresser.

350
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:21,726
Who made it?

351
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,591
Where'd it come from?

352
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,527
All right.

353
00:31:26,565 --> 00:31:30,228
Make me a copy.
I'll see what I can do.

354
00:31:34,906 --> 00:31:35,895
Thanks.

355
00:31:38,043 --> 00:31:40,637
Yeah.

356
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,517
You sure this is a copy?

357
00:33:30,555 --> 00:33:32,682
Yeah, why?

358
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:36,659
The numbers are all screwed up.

359
00:33:38,196 --> 00:33:43,031
The same problem
got copied, I guess.

360
00:33:43,401 --> 00:33:44,425
That's impossible.

361
00:33:44,469 --> 00:33:46,027
The numbers of
the control track

362
00:33:46,071 --> 00:33:48,266
they put on the tape
whenever it's recorded

363
00:33:48,306 --> 00:33:51,139
which means theoretically,
there shouldn't be any images.

364
00:33:51,176 --> 00:33:53,542
Hey, Noah, can you pretend
for one minute

365
00:33:53,578 --> 00:33:55,808
that I don't read
Video Geek Magazine?

366
00:33:55,847 --> 00:33:57,280
Okay, when you record a tape

367
00:33:57,382 --> 00:33:59,748
the makeup of the tracks
is like a signature

368
00:33:59,784 --> 00:34:01,513
for whatever did the recording

369
00:34:01,553 --> 00:34:03,919
like a camcorder,
VCR, whatever.

370
00:34:03,955 --> 00:34:06,617
So the control track could
tell us where it came from.

371
00:34:06,658 --> 00:34:08,125
But to not have one...

372
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,457
I mean, that's like being born
without fingerprints.

373
00:34:10,495 --> 00:34:13,259
Then, how did this get recorded?

374
00:34:13,298 --> 00:34:15,198
I don't know.

375
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:18,634
But I'm going to find out.

376
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,262
All right, take a look.

377
00:34:20,305 --> 00:34:22,500
You should be able
to see the camera here

378
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,700
in the reflection.

379
00:34:23,742 --> 00:34:25,801
The angle's straight
on, but you don't.

380
00:34:25,844 --> 00:34:27,573
Hmm. What's that?

381
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:29,439
It looks like she's walking away

382
00:34:29,481 --> 00:34:30,448
whoever she is.

383
00:34:30,482 --> 00:34:32,245
No, I mean up there at the top.

384
00:34:33,451 --> 00:34:35,442
Oh, no, that's
just the tracking.

385
00:34:35,487 --> 00:34:37,079
I can fix that.

386
00:34:37,122 --> 00:34:38,111
Whup, sorry.

387
00:34:38,156 --> 00:34:39,123
Wait, go back.

388
00:34:39,157 --> 00:34:40,317
There's something there.

389
00:34:40,425 --> 00:34:42,290
Yeah, you're right.

390
00:34:42,327 --> 00:34:43,726
--There's more picture.
--Hold on.

391
00:34:43,762 --> 00:34:44,922
I'm going to stretch
the alignment.

392
00:34:44,963 --> 00:34:46,123
Yeah, it's working.

393
00:34:46,164 --> 00:34:47,131
Yeah, it won't go any further.

394
00:34:47,165 --> 00:34:48,097
Okay, keep going.

395
00:34:48,133 --> 00:34:49,100
No, no, no, no, let me do it.

396
00:34:49,134 --> 00:34:50,123
Wait, it won't go any further.

397
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:51,260
It won't go any further!
Get...

398
00:34:51,302 --> 00:34:52,530
--Let me do it.
--Shit!

399
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:53,537
Oh...

400
00:34:55,473 --> 00:34:56,337
Hey, Noah

401
00:34:56,374 --> 00:34:57,602
I picked up the cameras.

402
00:34:57,642 --> 00:34:58,973
They're in really good shape.

403
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,443
Did you see the reprints I did

404
00:35:00,478 --> 00:35:02,173
of that Guatemala stuff?

405
00:35:02,213 --> 00:35:04,704
'Cause they came out kind of...

406
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:06,148
overexposed.

407
00:35:06,184 --> 00:35:07,549
You working?

408
00:35:07,585 --> 00:35:09,815
This is a friend, Rachel Keller.

409
00:35:09,854 --> 00:35:11,446
She writes for the ''P.I.''

410
00:35:11,489 --> 00:35:13,855
Rachel, this is Beth,
my assistant.

411
00:35:13,892 --> 00:35:16,224
Well, I prefer
''partner in crime.''

412
00:35:17,662 --> 00:35:19,994
She's a journalism student
at Kirkland, actually.

413
00:35:20,031 --> 00:35:21,555
Well, I'll stay
out of your way.

414
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:22,588
I'm not even here.

415
00:35:24,502 --> 00:35:27,733
Rachel is researching a story.
It's this video hoax.

416
00:35:27,772 --> 00:35:29,672
It's sort of interesting.
So you know video.

417
00:35:29,707 --> 00:35:31,538
Why don't you come take a look
at this thing with the tracking.

418
00:35:31,576 --> 00:35:32,565
You know, I'm late.

419
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:33,577
I really should go.

420
00:35:33,611 --> 00:35:34,873
Yeah, but why are you taking...?

421
00:35:34,913 --> 00:35:36,005
I got to go.

422
00:35:36,047 --> 00:35:37,537
It's good to meet you.

423
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,347
So you're taking the tape?

424
00:35:44,389 --> 00:35:45,617
I don't want her to see it.

425
00:35:45,657 --> 00:35:47,318
Whoa. You don't
want her to see it?

426
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:48,382
What about me
seeing it?

427
00:35:48,493 --> 00:35:50,222
You had no problem
showing it to me.

428
00:35:50,261 --> 00:35:52,661
I did have a problem.

429
00:35:52,697 --> 00:35:53,686
You're angry.

430
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:54,857
I'm not angry.

431
00:35:54,899 --> 00:35:56,560
Oh, no? What
are you then?

432
00:35:56,601 --> 00:35:58,159
In a hurry.

433
00:35:59,404 --> 00:36:02,032
Look, I'm sorry, but I'm
not going to get all worked up

434
00:36:02,073 --> 00:36:03,438
over some high school rumor.

435
00:36:06,044 --> 00:36:08,171
What are you thinking?

436
00:36:08,213 --> 00:36:10,408
I'm thinking this is
the part where I say

437
00:36:10,515 --> 00:36:12,779
''You're a flake,
never finishes anything.''

438
00:36:12,817 --> 00:36:14,876
Then you say
I'm ''an obsessive bitch.

439
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:16,352
Needs to lighten up.''

440
00:36:16,387 --> 00:36:17,547
Then I storm out

441
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:19,955
all pissed off, kicking myself
for ever thinking

442
00:36:19,991 --> 00:36:21,424
that you could just...

443
00:36:21,493 --> 00:36:23,723
grow up.

444
00:36:27,532 --> 00:36:30,729
So, why don't we just
cut to that part right now

445
00:36:30,768 --> 00:36:33,066
and save ourselves
a lot of grief?

446
00:36:35,507 --> 00:36:37,134
All right.

447
00:36:37,175 --> 00:36:39,234
Bye.

448
00:37:06,804 --> 00:37:08,328
Watch out, missy.

449
00:37:08,373 --> 00:37:10,364
Bad luck.
You don't need that.

450
00:37:40,405 --> 00:37:42,305
Becca?

451
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:45,104
Becca.

452
00:37:45,143 --> 00:37:47,338
We're almost there.

453
00:37:47,378 --> 00:37:48,504
Summer, actually.

454
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,514
So circle gets that square.

455
00:37:50,582 --> 00:37:53,483
We take a break,
while you check this out.

456
00:37:53,518 --> 00:37:55,748
This is how you can be part...

457
00:37:55,787 --> 00:37:57,812
Do you remember anything

458
00:37:57,855 --> 00:37:59,083
about that night...

459
00:37:59,123 --> 00:38:01,182
that night with Katie?

460
00:38:04,028 --> 00:38:06,656
Do you remember...

461
00:38:06,698 --> 00:38:08,689
how she died?

462
00:38:11,135 --> 00:38:13,797
Becca?

463
00:38:23,815 --> 00:38:26,215
She told you about a videotape,
didn't she?

464
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:34,481
She was afraid, wasn't she?

465
00:38:34,525 --> 00:38:37,426
Something was happening to her.

466
00:38:37,462 --> 00:38:39,930
Becca...

467
00:38:39,964 --> 00:38:42,990
how did she die?

468
00:38:43,034 --> 00:38:44,763
Please.

469
00:38:44,802 --> 00:38:46,929
I need to know.

470
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:51,872
And you will.

471
00:38:56,014 --> 00:38:57,948
She'll show you.

472
00:38:57,982 --> 00:38:59,574
Who?

473
00:38:59,651 --> 00:39:02,484
Who will show me?

474
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,614
Not now.

475
00:39:11,396 --> 00:39:14,559
Four days.

476
00:39:21,305 --> 00:39:22,397
Yeah, well, your home VCRs

477
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,702
will give you a tracking window

478
00:39:23,741 --> 00:39:25,072
but they won't
let you stretch it.

479
00:39:25,109 --> 00:39:27,543
There's no point, really, unless
you're talking restoration.

480
00:39:27,578 --> 00:39:28,772
Archives will come in here

481
00:39:28,813 --> 00:39:30,576
with these crummy old tapes
sometimes.

482
00:39:30,615 --> 00:39:32,776
Tracks totally shot--
servos can't line them up.

483
00:39:32,817 --> 00:39:34,341
But the big box here's
a warhorse.

484
00:39:34,385 --> 00:39:35,352
Totally analog.

485
00:39:35,386 --> 00:39:37,513
She'll read to the very edge
of your tape.

486
00:39:37,555 --> 00:39:40,353
Just don't force her or
she'll get pissy with you.

487
00:39:40,391 --> 00:39:43,622
Your tracking, your monitor,
your printer, if you need it.

488
00:39:43,695 --> 00:39:46,061
So, uh...

489
00:39:46,097 --> 00:39:48,531
what are we watching,
home movies or something?

490
00:39:48,566 --> 00:39:51,967
I'd really
rather watch it alone.

491
00:39:52,003 --> 00:39:53,732
Really.

492
00:39:53,771 --> 00:39:55,671
Whatever.

493
00:40:10,154 --> 00:40:12,486
Come on...

494
00:40:16,961 --> 00:40:18,622
Come on.

495
00:40:32,577 --> 00:40:34,602
Lighthouse.

496
00:40:37,448 --> 00:40:39,609
Shit.

497
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:42,084
Hello? Somebody?

498
00:40:48,126 --> 00:40:50,959
Damn.

499
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:27,425
Something you needed help with?

500
00:41:28,733 --> 00:41:31,167
Hey, you... you got a... ya...

501
00:41:41,045 --> 00:41:43,240
Well, that seems to be
the lot of it.

502
00:41:43,281 --> 00:41:44,805

My cousin was two packs a day.

518
00:45:26,203 --> 00:45:28,967
Used the patch...
never looked back.

519
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,201
All right, well,
I'll keep that in mind.

520

You, too.

522
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,527
Hi.

523
00:46:23,561 --> 00:46:25,119
Sorry I'm late.

524
00:46:25,162 --> 00:46:27,130
Uh... mmm... no. No problem.

525
00:46:27,164 --> 00:46:28,927
Everything okay?

526
00:46:28,966 --> 00:46:31,799
Oh, yeah. He was an angel.

527
00:46:31,836 --> 00:46:34,669
I-I... went in to tell him
that it was bedtime

528
00:46:34,705 --> 00:46:36,900
and he was already
under the covers.

529
00:46:36,941 --> 00:46:39,136
And then he read me
a bedtime story.

530
00:46:39,176 --> 00:46:41,508
Um... 

531
00:46:41,545 --> 00:46:43,570
he learned the word ''conundrum.''

532
00:46:43,614 --> 00:46:44,581
Really?

533
00:46:44,615 --> 00:46:47,880
Yeah. And then...
he drew my picture.

534
00:46:47,918 --> 00:46:50,045
Well, here you go.

535
00:46:50,154 --> 00:46:51,451
Thanks.

536
00:46:51,489 --> 00:46:52,649
Sure.

537
00:47:25,623 --> 00:47:26,590
Hey, Ruthie, it's me.

538
00:47:26,624 --> 00:47:28,854
I'm sorry to call so late,
but I need a favor.

539
00:47:28,893 --> 00:47:30,622
I have to go upstate
to do this story

540
00:47:30,661 --> 00:47:32,390
and I need you
to watch Aidan for me.

541
00:47:32,429 --> 00:47:34,488
Oh, Rachel, I don't know.

542
00:47:34,532 --> 00:47:35,794
How long will you be gone?

543
00:47:35,833 --> 00:47:37,460
It's just for two days,
I promise.

544
00:47:37,501 --> 00:47:39,059
This isn't the best time for me.

545
00:47:40,104 --> 00:47:42,402
Rachel? Rachel, are you there?

546
00:47:42,439 --> 00:47:44,407
Hold on a sec...
Sorry.

547
00:47:46,844 --> 00:47:48,573
Rachel?

548
00:47:48,612 --> 00:47:50,102
Is this about Katie?

549
00:48:14,772 --> 00:48:17,002
Ruthie...

550
00:48:38,929 --> 00:48:40,920
Aidan?

551
00:49:51,402 --> 00:49:53,199
No!

552
00:50:01,578 --> 00:50:03,910
Why, baby, why? Why?!

553
00:50:03,947 --> 00:50:05,744
I couldn't sleep.

554
00:50:10,688 --> 00:50:14,180
Who is she, Rachel?

555
00:50:30,974 --> 00:50:32,839
Leave him alone!

556
00:50:32,876 --> 00:50:34,241
Rachel?

557
00:50:38,682 --> 00:50:39,979
Noah...

558
00:50:40,017 --> 00:50:41,450
L-Listen to me. R-Rachel...

559
00:50:41,485 --> 00:50:43,453
I need to talk to you, okay?

560
00:50:43,487 --> 00:50:45,546
I...

561
00:50:48,392 --> 00:50:50,292
I believe you.

562
00:50:50,327 --> 00:50:53,524
Rachel, you there?

563
00:50:54,998 --> 00:50:58,161
He... He watched the tape.

564
00:50:58,202 --> 00:51:01,137
Who? Who watched it?

565
00:51:04,641 --> 00:51:06,802
Our son.

566
00:51:31,635 --> 00:51:33,432
You took my picture.

567
00:51:37,808 --> 00:51:40,606
I've seen you.

568
00:51:40,644 --> 00:51:44,341
When I'm in the yard at school.

569
00:51:44,415 --> 00:51:46,406
You're there.

570
00:51:47,651 --> 00:51:49,744
You wish I was around more?

571
00:51:49,787 --> 00:51:52,585
No.

572
00:51:52,623 --> 00:51:54,352
Do you want to be around more?

573
00:51:55,726 --> 00:51:57,489
Rachel and I were...

574
00:51:57,528 --> 00:51:59,462
Young.

575
00:51:59,496 --> 00:52:01,487
Mom's told me that story.

576
00:52:05,869 --> 00:52:07,894
The thing is, I...

577
00:52:07,938 --> 00:52:10,532
I don't think
I'd make a good father.

578
00:52:12,443 --> 00:52:15,378
Maybe it was because
my own was...

579
00:52:15,446 --> 00:52:18,609
such a... disappointment.

580
00:52:27,157 --> 00:52:30,149
Thing is, I don't want
anyone else to do it, either.

581
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:35,794
Be your father.

582
00:52:35,833 --> 00:52:37,391
It's a conundrum.

583
00:52:41,605 --> 00:52:43,539
Yeah, it is.

584
00:53:21,745 --> 00:53:23,440
Time to go, mister.

585
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,640
I'm not finished.

586
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:29,712
Noah said to make one for you.

587
00:53:37,294 --> 00:53:38,818
You could almost draw

588
00:53:38,862 --> 00:53:41,160
a line through her life.

589
00:53:41,198 --> 00:53:43,723
On one side,
there's this happy woman

590
00:53:43,767 --> 00:53:47,464
who spends her time with her
husband, riding horses

591
00:53:47,538 --> 00:53:51,099
everything sheltered,
protected and comfortable.

592
00:53:51,141 --> 00:53:55,703
Her face, there's... light,
there's pride.

593
00:53:55,746 --> 00:53:57,941
And then, one day,
something happens

594
00:53:57,981 --> 00:54:00,415
and she takes
this hard corner

595
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:02,475
and the light... goes out

596
00:54:02,553 --> 00:54:05,613
and then she ends up
at Eola County Psychiatric

597
00:54:05,656 --> 00:54:07,624
all alone.

598
00:54:07,658 --> 00:54:09,649
What happened to her?.

599
00:54:09,693 --> 00:54:11,661
l don't know yet

600
00:54:11,695 --> 00:54:14,323
but l think it has something
to do with the horses.

601
00:54:14,364 --> 00:54:16,764
lt think we should go
to the island together.

602
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,324
lt's Tuesday, Noah.

603
00:54:18,368 --> 00:54:20,427
l only have one day left.

604
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:21,903
l need you to go to the
hospital

605
00:54:21,939 --> 00:54:23,839
and find out as much
as you can about Anna.

606
00:54:23,874 --> 00:54:27,867
The images on the tape
are leading us somewhere.

607
00:54:27,911 --> 00:54:29,435
Katie saw them all, too.

608
00:54:29,479 --> 00:54:33,074
I think... before you die

609
00:54:33,116 --> 00:54:35,107
you see the ring.

610
00:54:48,265 --> 00:54:49,323
Shit!

611
00:54:49,366 --> 00:54:52,164
Hey, Rach! Wait!

612
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:48,458
A daughter?
