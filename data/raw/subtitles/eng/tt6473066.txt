So I came up with three questions to help
you write the perfect college essay.

340
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:48,998
Question number one: What
do you hope to accomplish in college?

341
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:51,543
What do you wanna do once you get there?

342
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:53,586
Do you actually wanna go there to learn,

343
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,547
or do you wanna just go there
and play around?

344
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:59,092
Beer pong, physics? Think about that.

345
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:03,930
Number two:
What special attributes do you have

346
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:06,266
that should qualify you for consideration?

347
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:08,852
Why should a university accept you?

348
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:10,729
What do you have to offer?

349
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:12,731
And not even just to a university,
to the world?

350
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:14,441
What are your best attributes?

351
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,401
And finally, the last question,

352
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:19,529
and it comes from
one of my favorite poets, Mary Oliver.

353
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:28,038
What do you wanna do with your one,
wild and precious life?

354

one of the greats to ever do it.
