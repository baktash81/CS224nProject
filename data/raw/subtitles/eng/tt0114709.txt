All right, everyone! This is a stickup!
Don't anybody move!

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,317
Now empty that safe.

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,588
- Money, money, money!
- Stop it! Stop it, you mean old potato.

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,678
Quiet, Bo Peep,

Help! Baa! Help us!

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,195

Somebody, do something!

I'm here to stop you,
One-Eyed Bart.

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,159
- How'd you know it was me?
- Are you gonna come quietly?

20
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,238
You can't touch me, Sheriff.

21
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:10,796
I brought my attack dog with
the built-in force field.

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,310
Well, I brought my dinosaur
who eats force-field dogs.

00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:16,411
- [ Growling ]
- Yipe, yipe, yipe, yipe!

24
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,635
You're going to jail, Bart.
Say good-bye to the wife and tater tots.

- What do you think?
- Oh, this looks great, Mom!

55
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,938
Okay, birthday boy.

56
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:46,197
We saw that at the store!
I asked you for it!

57
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,457
- I hope I have enough places.
- Wow, look at that! That's so...

58

- Oh, my gosh, you got...
- One, two... four.

Yeah,
I think that's going to be enough.

- Can we leave this up 'til we move?
- Well, sure.

61

- We can leave it up.
- Yeah!

62
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,268

- You uncultured swine.

78
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,233
- Uh, hey, Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
- Sir! No, sir!

79
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,271
Okay. Hey, thank you.
At ease.

80
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,439
- Hey, uh, Slinky?
- Right here, Woody. I-I'm red this time.

No, S-Slink...

00:04:25,837 --> 00:04:27,313
Oh, well, all right.
You can be red if you want.

83
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,715
N-Not now, Slink.
I got some bad news.

84
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,816
- Bad news?
- Shh, shh, shh!

85

Fastest knobs in the West.

Now, where is that... Oh.

94
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,995
Hey, who moved my doodle pad
way over here?

95
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,715
- Uh, how're you doin', Rex?
- Were you scared? Tell me honestly.

96
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,671
I was close to being scared
that time.

97
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,315
Oh, I'm going for fearsome here,
but I just don't feel it!

98
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,510
I think I'm just
coming off as annoying.

99
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,558
Ow! Oh, hi, Bo. Hi.

100
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,672
I wanted to thank you, Woody,
for saving my flock.

101
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,995
Oh, hey, it was, uh, nothin'.

102
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,148
What do you say I get someone else
to watch the sheep tonight?

103
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,589
Oh, yeah.
I...

104
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,679
Remember, I'm just
a couple of blocks away.

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,877
Come on, come on.
Smaller toys up front.

106
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,477
Hey, Woody, come on.

107
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,354
Oh, thanks, Mike.
Okay... Oh, whoa. Step back.

108
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,789
- For crying out loud.
- Okay. Thank you.

109
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,714
Hello. Check.
That better? Great.

110
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,513
Everybody hear me?
Up on the shelf, can you hear me? Great.

111
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,837
Okay, first item today:

112
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,918
uh, oh, yeah... has everyone picked
a moving buddy?

113
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,300
- What?
- Moving buddy? You can't be serious.

114
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,511
Well, I didn't know we were
supposed to have one already.

115
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,275
Do we have to hold hands?

116
00:06:15,276 --> 00:06:18,311
- Oh, yeah.
- You guys think this is a big joke.

117
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,396
We've only got one week
left before the move.

118
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:22,353
I don't want any toys left behind.

119
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,075
A moving buddy.
If you don't have one, get one!

120
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,158
All right, next.
Uh, oh, yes.

121
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,317
Tuesday night's plastic
corrosion awareness meeting...

122
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,908
was, I think,
a big success,

123
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,713
and we want to thank Mr. Spell
for putting that on for us.

124
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,434
<i>- Thank you, Mr. Spell.
You're welcome.</i>

125
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,677
Okay. Uh, oh, yes.
One, uh, minor note here.

126
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,360
Andy's birthday party
has been moved to today.

127
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,095
Uh, next we have...
- Wait a minute.

128
00:06:48,096 --> 00:06:49,711
What do you mean the party's today?

129
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,274
- His birthday's not 'til next week!
- What's goin' on down there?

130
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,697
Is his mom losin' her marbles?

131
00:06:53,698 --> 00:06:57,394
Well, obviously, she wanted to
have the party before the move.

132
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,135
- I'm not worried.
- You shouldn't be worried.

133
00:06:59,136 --> 00:07:00,751
Of course Woody ain't worried.

134
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,899
He's been Andy's favorite
since kindergarten.

135
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,919
- Hey, hey.
- Come on, Potato Head.

136
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,510
If Woody says it's all right, then,
well, darn it, it's good enough for me.

137
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,915
Woody has never
steered us wrong before.

138
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,510
Come on, guys. Every Christmas
and birthday we go through this.

139
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,552
But what if Andy gets
another dinosaur, a mean one?

140
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,274
I just don't think I could take
that kind of rejection!

141
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,550
Hey, listen.
No one's getting replaced.

142
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,399
This is Andy
we're talking about.

143
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,796
It doesn't matter how much
we're played with.

144
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,318
What matters is that we're here
for Andy when he needs us.

145
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,271
That's what we're
made for, right?

146
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,109
Pardon me. I hate to break up
the staff meeting, but they're here!

147
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,674
- Birthday guests at three o'clock!
- Stay calm, everyone!

148
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,311
Hey!

149
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,419
Uh, meeting adjourned.

150
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,399
Ho, boy, will you take a
look at all those presents?

151
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,919
I can't see a thing.

152
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,198
Yes, sir. We're next month's
garage sale fodder for sure.

153
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,039
- Any dinosaur-shaped ones?
- Oh, for crying out loud.

154
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,197
- They're all in boxes, you idiot.
- They're getting bigger!

155
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,935
Wait, there's a nice
little one over there.

156
00:08:06,936 --> 00:08:08,551
<i>Hi!</i>

157
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,339
<i> Spell: trash can.
- We're doomed!</i>

158
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,516
All right. All right!

159
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,832
If I send out the troops,
will you all calm down?

160
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,430
- Yes! Yes! We promise!
- Okay! Save your batteries.

161
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,869
Eh, very good, Woody.
That's using the old noodle.

162
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,156
Sergeant, establish a recon post
downstairs. Code Red!

163
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,078
- You know what to do.
- Yes, sir!

164
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,156
All right, men.
You heard him. Code Red!

165
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,272
Repeat: we are at Code Red.
Recon plan Charlie. Execute!

166
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,356
Let's move, move,
move, move, move!

167
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,739
Okay. Come on, kids.
Everyone in the living room.

168
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,478
It's almost time for the presents.

169
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,476
All right, gangway, gangway.

170
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,558
And this is how we find out...

171
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,796
what is in those presents.

172
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,309
Okay! Who's hungry?

173
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,194
Here come the chips!
I've got Cool Ranch and barbecue! Ow!

174
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,269
What in the world? Oh!
I thought I told him to pick these up.

175
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,755
Shouldn't they be there by now?
What's taking them so long?

176
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,236
Hey, these guys are professionals.
They're the best.

177
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,715
Come on. They're not
lying down on the job.

178
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,137
G-Go on without me.
Just go.

179
00:10:13,138 --> 00:10:16,274
A good soldier never
leaves a man behind.

180
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,560
Okay, everybody.
Come on.

181
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,389
Settle down. Now, kids.
Everybody... You sit in a circle.

182
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,875
No, Andy. Andy, you sit
in the middle there.

183
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,993
Good. And which present
are you gonna open first?

184
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,760
There they are.

185
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,416
<i>Come in, Mother Bird.
This is Alpha Bravo.</i>

186
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,952
<i>- This is it! This is it!
- Come in, Mother Bird.</i>

187
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,174
<i>- Quiet, quiet, quiet!
- All right</i>

188
00:10:54,175 --> 00:10:56,868
<i>Andy's opening
the first present now.</i>

189
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,276
Mrs. Potato Head! Mrs. Potato Head!
Mrs. Potato Head!

190
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,994
<i>- Hey, I can dream, can't I?
- The bow's coming off.</i>

191
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,032
<i>He's ripping the wrapping paper.
It's a... It's... It's a...</i>

192
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,310
<i>A lunch box.
We've got a lunch box here.</i>

193
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,799
A lunch box?

194
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,159
- A lunch box?
- For the lunch.

195
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,396
<i>Okay, second present.
It appears to be...</i>

196
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,353
<i>- Okay, it's bed sheets.
- Who invited that kid?</i>

197
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,549
Oh! Only one left.

198
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,955
<i>- Okay, we're on the last present now.
- Last present!</i>

199
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,596
<i>It's a big one. It's a...
It's a board game! Repeat: Battleship.</i>

200
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,756
- Yay!
- Hallelujah!

201
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,734
- Yeah, all right.
- Hey! Watch it!

202
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,589
Sorry there, old spud head.

203
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,269
Mission accomplished. Well done, men.
Pack it up. We're goin' home.

204
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,755
So did I tell you? Huh?
Nothin' to worry about.

205
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,759
I knew you were right all along, Woody.
Never doubted you for a second.

206
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,190
Wait a minute.
Oh, what do we have here? Ohh!

207
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,356
Wait!
Turn that thing back on!

208
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,277
<i>Come in, Mother Bird.
Come in, Mother Bird.</i>

209
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,914
<i>Mom has pulled a surprise
present from the closet.</i>

210
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,554
<i>Andy's opening it.
He's really excited about this one.</i>

211
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,477
- Mom! What is it?
- It's a huge package.

212
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,592
Oh, get outta the... One of the kids
is in the way. I can't see.

213
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,632
It's a...

214
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,589
It's a what?
What is it?

215
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,056
- Oh, no!
- Oh, ya big lizard!

216
00:12:14,057 --> 00:12:15,393
Now we'll never know what it is!

217
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,835
Way to go, Rex!

218
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,479
- No, no! Turn 'em around!
Turn 'em around!

219
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,398
Oh, he's puttin'
'em in backwards.

220
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,616
You're... You're
puttin' 'em in backwards!

221
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,759
Plus is positive,
minus is negative! Oh, let me!

222
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,631
Let's go to my room, guys!

223
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,150
<i>Red alert! Red alert!
Andy is coming upstairs!</i>

224
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,359
<i>- There!
- Juvenile intrusion. </i>

225
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,238
<i>Repeat,
resume your positions now!</i>

226
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,954
Andy's coming, everybody!
Back to your places! Hurry!

227
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,877
Get to your places!
Get to your places!

228
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,036
Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear?
Did you see my ear?

229
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,675
Out of my way! Here I come!
Here I come! Ohh!

230
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,508
Hey, look!
Its lasers light up.

231
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,656
- Take that, Zurg!
- Quick, make a space.

232
00:12:58,657 --> 00:13:00,872
This is where the spaceship lands.

233
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,150
And he does it back, and he does
a karate-chop action.

234
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,033
Come on down, guys!
It's time for games!

235
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,390
- We got prizes!
- Oh, yeah!

236
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,837
- What is it?
- Can you see it?

237
00:13:20,838 --> 00:13:22,115
What the heck is up there?

238
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,073
Woody, who's up there
with ya?

239
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,154
Woody, what are you
doing under the bed?

240
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,257
Uh, nothin'.
Uh, nothin'.

241
00:13:30,258 --> 00:13:33,034
I'm sure Andy was just a
little excited, that's all.

242
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,799
Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.
It's just a mistake!

243
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,515
Well, that mistake is sitting
in your spot, Woody.

244
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,632
- Oh! Have you been replaced?
- Hey, what did I tell you earlier?

245
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,637
No one is getting replaced.

246
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,150
Now, let's all be polite
and give whatever it is up there...

247
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,750
a nice, big
Andy's-room welcome.

248
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,878
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.
Come in, Star Command.

249
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,356
Star Command, come in.
Do you read me?

250
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,789
Why don't they answer?

251
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,717
My ship!

252
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,597
Blast! This'll take
weeks to repair.

253
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,871
Buzz Lightyear mission log,
stardate 4-0-7-2.

254
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,912
My ship has run off course
en route to sector 12.

255
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,429
I've crash-landed
on a strange planet.

256
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,949
The impact must've awoken me
from hypersleep.

257
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,192
Terrain seems
a bit unstable.

258
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,450
No readout yet
if the air is breathable.

259
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,154
And there seems to be no sign
of intelligent life anywhere.

260
00:14:53,355 --> 00:14:55,629
Hello!

261
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,275
Whoa! He-Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Did I frighten you?

262
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,517
Didn't mean to. Sorry.
Howdy. My name is Woody...

263
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,710
and this is Andy's room.

264
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,637
That's all I wanted to say.

265
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,955
And also, there has been
a bit of a mix-up.

266
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,310
This is my spot, see...
the bed here.

267
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,795
Local law enforcement.
It's about time you got here.

268
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,559
I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger,
Universe Protection Unit.

269
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,796
My ship has crash-landed
here by mistake.

270
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,390
Yes, it is a mistake, because,
you see, the bed here is my spot.

271
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,317
I need to repair
my turbo boosters.

272
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,159
Do you people still use fossil fuels, or
have you discovered crystallic fusion?

273
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,874
Well, let's see.
We got double-A's.

274
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,389
- Watch yourself! Halt! Who goes there?
- Don't shoot!

275
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,034
- It's okay. Friends.
- Do you know these life-forms?

276
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,720
Yes. They're Andy's toys.

277
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,751
All right, everyone.
You're clear to come up.

278
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,553
I am Buzz Lightyear.
I come in peace.

279
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,752
Oh, I'm so glad
you're not a dinosaur!

280
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,314
All right, thank you.

281
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,829
Now, thank you all
for your kind welcome.

282
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,111
- Say, what's that button do?
- I'll show you.

283
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,549
<i>- Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.
- Wow!</i>

284
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,558
Hey, Woody's got something like that.
His is a pull string, only it's...

285
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,717
- Only it sounds like a car ran over it.
- Oh, yeah, but not like this one.

286
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,796
This is a quality sound system.

287
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,596
Probably all copper wiring, huh? So, uh,
where you from? Singapore? Hong Kong?

288
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,176
Well, no. Actually, l-I'm...

289
00:16:11,177 --> 00:16:14,032
I'm stationed up in the
Gamma Quadrant of Sector Four.

290
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,073
As a member of the elite Universe
Protection Unit of the Space Ranger Corps,

291
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,760
I protect the galaxy
from the threat of invasion...

292
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,431
from the evil Emperor Zurg,
sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance.

293
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,471
Oh, really?
I'm from Playskool.

294
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,830
And I'm from Mattel.
Well, I'm not really from Mattel.

295
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,793
I'm actually from a smaller company that
was purchased in a leveraged buyout.

296
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,559
You'd think they'd never
seen a new toy before.

297
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,435
Well, sure, look at him. He's got more
gadgets on him than a Swiss Army knife.

298
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,238
Ah, ah, ah, ah!
Please be careful.

299
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,916
You don't want to be in the way
when my laser goes off.

300
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,191
Hey, a laser! How come
you don't have a laser, Woody?

301
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,232
It's not a laser. It's a...
It's a little light bulb that blinks.

302
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,839
- What's with him?
- Laser envy.

303
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,318
All right, that's enough!

304
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,432
Look, we're all very impressed
with Andy's new toy.

305
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,994
- Toy?
- T-O-Y. TOY!

306
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,874
Excuse me. l-I think the word
you're searching for is "Space Ranger".

307
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,152
The word I'm searching for I can't say
because there's preschool toys present.

308
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,554
Gettin' kind of tense,
aren't ya?

309
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,638
Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear,
uh, now, I'm curious.

310
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,399
What does a Space Ranger
actually do?

311
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,878
He's not a Space Ranger! He doesn't
fight evil or... or shoot lasers or fly!

312
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,389
Excuse me.

313
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,751
- Wow!
- Oh, impressive wingspan. Very good!

314
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,351
Oh, what? What? These are plastic.
He can't fly.

315
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,756
<i>They are a terillium-carbonic
alloy, and I can fly.</i>

316
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,897
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can.

317
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,000
- You can't.
- Can.

318
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:39,680
Can't. Can't. Can't!

319
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,360
I tell you, I could fly around
this room with my eyes closed!

320
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,391
Okay, then, Mr. Light Beer,
prove it.

321
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,317
All right, then, I will.

322
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,237
Stand back, everyone.

323
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,314
To infinity and beyond!

324
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,638
- Can!
- Whoa!

325
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,149
Oh, wow! You flew
magnificently!

326
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,114
- I found my movin' buddy.
- Thank you. Th-Thank you all. Thank you.

327
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,074
That wasn't flying.
That was falling with style.

328
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,158
Man, the dolls must really go for you.
Can you teach me that?

329
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,038
- Golly bob howdy!
- Oh, shut up!

330
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,152
No, in a couple of days, everything will
be just the way it was. They'll see.

331
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,669
They'll see. I'm still
Andy's favorite toy.

332
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,390
<i># I was on top of the world #

333
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,195

338

339
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,632
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

Oh! Finally.

364
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,759
- Hey, who's got my hat?
- Look, I'm Woody. Howdy, howdy, howdy.

365
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,190
Ah-ha. Ah-ha!
Give me that!

366
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,959
Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog,
let me show you something.

367
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,548
It looks as though I've been
accepted into your culture.

368
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,513
Your chief, Andy,
inscribed his name on me.

369
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,552
Wow! With permanent ink too!

370
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,433
Well, I must get back
to repairing my ship.

371
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,159
- Don't let it get to you, Woody.
- Uh, let what?

372
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,077
I don't, uh...
What do you mean? Who?

373
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,839
I know Andy's excited
about Buzz,

374
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,430
but you know he'll always have
a special place for you.

375
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,870
- Yeah, like the attic.
- All right! That's it!

376
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,354
<i>- Unidirectional bonding strip.
- Mr. Lightyear wants more tape.</i>

377
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,837
Listen, Light Snack,
you stay away from Andy.

378
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,430
He's mine, and no one
is taking him away from me.

379
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,269
What are you talking about?
Where's that bonding strip?

380
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,754
And another thing:
Stop with this spaceman thing!

381
00:21:58,755 --> 00:21:59,989
It's getting on my nerves!

382
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,395
Are you saying you want to
lodge a complaint with Star Command?

383
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,308
Oh-ho-ho! Okay! Ooh, well, so you wanna
do it the hard way, huh?

384
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,035
- Don't even think about it, cowboy.
- Oh, yeah, tough guy?

385
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,016
The air isn't toxic.

386
00:22:23,017 --> 00:22:26,633
How dare you open a spaceman's
helmet on an uncharted planet!

387
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,719
My eyeballs could've been
sucked from their sockets.

388
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,072
You actually think
you're The Buzz Lightyear?

389
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,953
Oh, all this time
I thought it was an act!

390
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,470
Hey, guys, look!
It's the real Buzz Lightyear!

391
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,433
- You're mocking me, aren't you?
- Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

392
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,357
- Buzz, look! An alien!
- Where?

393
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,389
Yes!

394
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,999
Whoa!

395
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,156
- Uh-oh.
- It's Sid!

396
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,477
- Don't move!
- I thought he was at summer camp.

397
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,716
They, uh, must have kicked
him out early this year.

398
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,832
Oh, no, not Sid!

399
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,359
Incoming!

400
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,314
- Who is it this time?
- Uh, I can't... I can't tell.

401
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,317
- Hey, where's Lenny?
- Right here, Woody.

402
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,876
Oh, no, I can't bear
to watch one of these again.

403
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,276
- Stay where you are!
- Oh, no, it's a Combat Carl.

404
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,555
- What's going on?
- Nothing that concerns you spacemen

405
00:23:26,556 --> 00:23:28,110
Just us toys.

406
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,834
I'd better take a look
anyway.

407
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,871
Why is that soldier strapped
to an explosive device?

408
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,992
That's why... Sid.

409
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,318
- Hmm, sure is a hairy fellow.
- No, no, that's Scud, you idiot.

410
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,749
That is Sid.

411
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,000
- You mean that happy child?
- That ain't no happy child.

412
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,908
He tortures toys,
just for fun!

413
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,078
Well, then, we've
got to do something.

414
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,419
- What are you doing?
- Get down from there!

415
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,839
I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson.

416
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,794
Yeah, sure. You go ahead.
Melt him with your scary laser.

417
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,878
Be careful with that.
It's extremely dangerous.

418
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,470
He's lighting it!
He's lighting it! Hit the dirt!

419
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,397
Look out!

420
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,634
Yes! He's gone!
He's history!

421
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,157
I could've stopped him.

422
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,352
Buzz, I would love
to see you try.

423
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,835
- Of course, I'd love to see you as a crater.
- Yeah!

424
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,238
- The sooner we move, the better.
- Oh, what a great shot. Yeah!

425
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,151
To infinity and beyond!

426
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,458
Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.

427
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:44,637
What would you say to dinner
at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?

428
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,150
Pizza Planet? Oh, cool!

429
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,236
Go wash your hands,
and I'll get Molly ready.

430
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,432
- Can I bring some toys?
- You can bring one toy.

431
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,313
- Just one?
- One toy?

432
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,229
Will Andy pick me?

433
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,669
"Don't count on it"?
Ohh!

434
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,350
Buzz! Oh, Buzz!
Buzz Lightyear!

435
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,948
Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness!
We've got trouble!

436
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,514
- Trouble? Where?
- Down there. Just down there.

437
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,359
A helpless toy!
It's... It's trapped, Buzz!

438
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,516
Then we've no time to lose.

439
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,215
- I don't see anything.
- Uh, he's there.

440
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:50,491
Just... Just keep looking.

441
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,956
What kind of toy...

442
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,556
- Buzz!
- Buzz!

443
00:26:10,557 --> 00:26:11,432
Buzz!

444
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,277
- I don't see him in the driveway.
- Did you see what happened?

445
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,676
- I think he bounced into Sid's yard!
- Ohh! Buzz!

446
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:25,038
Hey, everyone! R.C.'s trying
to say something. What is it, boy?

447
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,879
- He's saying that this was no accident.
- Huh?

448
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,309
- What do you mean?
- I mean Humpty-Dumpty was pushed.

449
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,806
- No!
- By Woody!

450
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:32,973
- What?
- What?

451
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,673
Wait a minute.

452
00:26:33,674 --> 00:26:36,847
You... You don't think
I meant to knock Buzz out the window,

453
00:26:36,848 --> 00:26:37,994
Do you?
Potato Head?

454
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,353
That's Mr. Potato Head to you,
you back-stabbin' murderer!

455
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,869
Now, it was an accident, guys.
Come on.

456
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,070
Now, you... you gotta
believe me.

457
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,397
We believe ya, Woody.
Right, Rex?

458
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,875
Well, ye... n...
I don't like confrontations.

459
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,099
Where is your honor, dirt bag?
You are an absolute disgrace!

460
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,199
You don't deserve to... Hey!

461
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,153
You couldn't handle Buzz cuttin' in
on your playtime, could you, Woody?

462
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,158
Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz
just might be Andy's new favorite toy.

463
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,494
So you got rid of him.

464
00:27:06,495 --> 00:27:08,309
Well, what if Andy starts playing with me more, Woody, huh?

465
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,176
You're gonna knock me out
of the window too?

466
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,637
- I don't think we should give him the chance.
- There he is, men.

467
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,990
- Frag him!
- Let's string him up by his pull string!

468
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,195
- I've got dibs on his hat!
- Would you boys stop it?

469
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,674
- Tackle him!
- No, no, no! W-W-Wait!

470
00:27:19,675 --> 00:27:20,829
Boys, stop it!

471
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,474
- I can explain everything.
- Okay, Mom, be right down.

472
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,875
- I've gotta get Buzz.
- Retreat!

473
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,057
- Mom, do you know where Buzz is?
- No, I haven't seen him.

474
00:27:33,058 --> 00:27:34,355
Psst!

475
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,835
Andy, I'm heading
out the door!

476
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,337
- But, Mom, I can't find him!
- Honey, just grab some other toy.

477
00:27:41,338 --> 00:27:42,714
Now, come on.

478
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,796
Okay.

479
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,716
I couldn't find my Buzz.
I know I left him right there.

480
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,638
Honey, I'm sure he's around.
You'll find him.

481
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,394
It's too short!
We need more monkeys!

482
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,432
There aren't any more!
That's the whole barrel!

483
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,671
Buzz, the monkeys
aren't working.

484
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,030
We're formulating
another plan!

485
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,709
Stay calm!
Oh, where could he be?

486
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,797
- Can I help pump the gas?
- Sure! I'll even let you drive.

487
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,717
- Yeah?
- Yeah, when you're 16.

488
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,796
Yuk, yuk, yuk.
Funny, Mom.

489
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:46,232
Oh, great. How am I gonna convince
those guys it was an accident?

490
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,477
Buzz!

491
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,388
Buzz! Hah! You're alive!

492
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,877
This is great! Oh, I'm saved!
I'm saved! Andy will find you here.

493
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,072
He'll take us back to the room,
and then you can tell everyone...

494
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,158
that this was all
just a big mistake.

495
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,999
Huh? Right? Buddy?

496
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,351
I just want you to know that even
though you tried to terminate me,

497
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,119
revenge is not an idea
we promote on my planet.

498
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,596
- Oh. Oh, that's good.
- But we're not on my planet.

499
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,948
- Are we?
- No.

500
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,110
Okay. Come on!
You want a piece of me?

501
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,718
<i>Ow!</i>

502
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:39,396
<i>Buzz... Buzz... Buzz
Lightyear to the rescue.</i>

503
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,699
<i>- Ouch!</i>

504
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,479
- Next stop...
- Pizza Planet. Yeah!

505
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,078
Andy!

506
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,518
Wh... Doesn't he realize
that I'm not there?

507
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,877
I'm lost!

508
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,999
Oh, I'm a lost toy!

509
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,592
Buzz Lightyear mission log.

510
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,632
The local sheriff and I seem to be at
a huge refueling station of some sort.

511
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,591
You!

512
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,155
- According to my navi-computer, the...
- Shut up!

513
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,352
- Just shut up, you idiot!
- Sheriff, this is no time to panic.

514
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,711
This is the perfect time to panic!
I'm lost! Andy is gone!

515
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,070
They're gonna move from their house
in two days, and it's all your fault!

516
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,237
My... My fault? If you hadn't pushed me
out of the window in the first place...

517
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,148
Oh, yeah? Well, if you hadn't shown up in
your stupid little cardboard spaceship...

518
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,316
and taken away everything
that was important to me...

519
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,032
Don't talk to me
about importance.

520
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,913
Because of you, the security
of this entire universe is in jeopardy!

521
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,156
What? What are you
talking about?

522
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,114
Right now, poised at the edge of the galaxy,
Emperor Zurg has been secretly building...

523
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,630
a weapon with the destructive capacity
to annihilate an entire planet!

524
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,673
I alone have information that reveals
this weapon's only weakness.

525
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:18,430
And you, my friend, are responsible for
delaying my rendezvous with Star Command!

526
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,798
You are a toy!

527
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,754
You aren't the real Buzz Lightyear!
You're a... Uh, you're an action figure!

528
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,714
You are a child's
plaything!

529
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,391
You are a sad, strange little man,
and you have my pity. Farewell.

530
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,910
Oh, yeah? Well,
good riddance, ya loony.

531
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,112
"Rendezvous with Star Command."

532
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,379
<i>- Hey, gas dude!
- You talking to me?</i>

533
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,819
<i>- Pizza Planet?
- Yeah, man. Can you help me?</i>

534
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,231
<i>- D'you know where Cutting Boulevard is?
- Andy!</i>

535
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,157
- Just a moment.
- Oh, no!

536
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,958
I can't show my face
in that room without Buzz.

537
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:56,238
- Buzz! Buzz, come back!
- Go away.

538
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,397
No, Buzz, you gotta come back!
l...

539
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,315
I found a spaceship!

540
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,516
It's a spaceship, Buzz.

541
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,756
Come on, man, hurry up! Um, like,
the pizzas are getting cold here.

542
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,236
- Oh, yeah, Cutting Boulevard.
- Yeah, yeah. Which way?

543
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,396
Now, you're sure this space
freighter will return...

544
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,397
to its port of origin once
it jettisons its food supply?

545
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,715
Uh-huh. And when we
get there,

546
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,832
we'll be able to find a way
to transport you home.

547
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,350
- Well, then, let's climb aboard.
- No, no, no, wait! Buzz! Buzz!

548
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,357
Let's get in the back.
No one will see us there.

549
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,392
Negative. There are no restraining
harnesses in the cargo area.

550
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,193
- We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
- Yeah, but...

551
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,834
- Buzz! Buzz!
- That's two lefts and a right, huh?

552
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,757
- Yeah.
- Uh, thanks for the directions, okay?

553
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,235
- Yeah, remember, kid...
- Buzz!

554
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,598
"It's safer in the cockpit than
the cargo bay." What an idiot.

555
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,279
<i>Next shuttle lift off scheduled
for T-minus 30 minutes and counting.</i>

556
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,916
<i>You are cleared to enter.</i>

557
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,598
<i>Welcome to Pizza Planet.</i>

558
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:39,999
<i>The white zone is for eating pizza...
- Sheriff!</i>

559
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,896
Sheriff? There you are.

560
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,114
Now, the entrance is heavily guarded.
We need a way to get inside.

561
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,714
Great idea, Woody.
I like your thinkin'.

562
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,400
<i>You are cleared to enter.</i>

563
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,829
<i>- Welcome to Pizza Planet.
- Now!</i>

564
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,679
Quickly, Sheriff!
The air lock is closing.

565
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,394
<i>Jones, party of five,
your shuttle is now boarding...</i>

566
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,397
Mom, can we have
some tokens?

567
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:08,399
- Ow! Watch where you're going!
- Sorry!

568
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,829
<i>Nine, Eight, Seven, Six,</i>

569
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,997
<i>Five, Four, Three,</i>

570
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,897
<i>Two, One.</i>

571
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,874
What a spaceport!
Good work, Woody.

572
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,494
- Mom, can I play Black Hole?
Please, please, please!

573
00:34:37,495 --> 00:34:38,719
- Andy!
- Oh, it's so cool!

574
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,331
Now, we need to find a ship
that's headed for Sector 12.

575
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,474
Wait a minute. No, no, no, Buzz.

576
00:34:41,475 --> 00:34:44,289
This way! There's a
special ship. I just saw it.

577
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,919
You mean it has hyperdrive?

578
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:51,590
Hyperactive hyperdrive
and Astro, uh, turf!

579
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,154
- Where is it? l-I don't see the...
- Come on. That's it.

580
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,077
Spaceship!

581
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,892
All right, Buzz,
get ready. And...

582
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,178
Until the universe explodes!

583
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:03,637
Okay, Buzz, when I say go,
we're gonna jump in the basket.

584
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,797
Buzz!

585
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,077
- Hey, Mom, if I eat all of my pizza,
- No!

586
00:35:08,078 --> 00:35:10,335
Can I have some alien slime?

587
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,391
This cannot be
happening to me!

588
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:25,189
<i>- A stranger.
- From the outside. Ooh!</i>

589
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:28,039
Greetings.
I am Buzz Lightyear.

590
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,915
- I come in peace.
- Tell me what it's like outside.

591
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,318
<i>Before your space journey, re-energize
yourself with a slice of pepperoni,</i>

592
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,113
<i>now boarding at counter three.</i>

593
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,552
This is an intergalactic emergency.
I need to commandeer your vessel to Sector 12.

594
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,955
Who's in charge here?

595
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,833
<i>The claw!</i>

596
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,655
<i>The claw is our master.</i>

597
00:35:52,656 --> 00:35:55,071
<i>- The claw chooses who
will go and who will stay.</i>

598
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,397
<i>- This is ludicrous.
- Hey, bozo, you got a brain in there?</i>

599
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,995
<i>Take that!</i>

600
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,908
Oh, no! Sid!
Get down!

601
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,110
- What's gotten into you, Sheriff? I wa...
- You are the one...

602
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,629
<i>- That decided to climb into this...
- Shh! The claw.</i>

603
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,399
<i>It moves.</i>

604
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,991
<i>I have been chosen!</i>

605
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,556
<i>Farewell, my friends.
I go on to a better place.</i>

606
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,477
<i>Gotcha!</i>

607
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,753
<i>A Buzz Lightyear?
No way!</i>

608
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,836
<i>- Yes!
- Buzz! No!</i>

609
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,237
<i>Hey!</i>

610
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,855
<i>- He has been chosen.
- He must go. Hey!</i>

611
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,477
<i>- You might anger the claw.</i>

612
00:36:57,478 --> 00:36:59,874
<i>- What are you doing? Stop it!
- The claw! The claw!</i>

613
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,356
<i>- Stop it, you zealots!
- Do not fight the claw.</i>

614
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,318
<i>All right!
Double prizes!</i>

615
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,434
<i>Let's go home and play.</i>

616
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,158
Sheriff, I can see your dwelling
from here. You're almost home.

617
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,475
Nirvana is coming.
The mystic portal awaits.

618
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,989
Will you be quiet?
You guys don't get it, do you?

619
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,954
Once we go into Sid's house,
we won't be coming out!

620
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:42,073
Whoa, Scud! Hey, boy!
Sit! Good boy.

621
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,397
- Hey, I got something for you, boy.
- Freeze!

622
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,510
Ready, set, now!

623
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,989
Hannah! Hey, Hannah!

624
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,076
- What?
- Did I get my package in the mail?

625
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,475
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

626
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,909
I don't know.

627
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,234
- Oh, no, Hannah!
- What?

628
00:38:01,235 --> 00:38:02,429
Look... Janie!

629
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:02,935
Hey!

630
00:38:02,936 --> 00:38:04,410
- She's sick!
- No, she's not!

631
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,400
- I'll have to perform one of my operations.
- No!

632
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,556
- Not Sid's room. Not there.
- No!

633
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,477
Sid, give her back!

634
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,437
Sid!

635
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,197
- Oh, no! - Mom!
- We have a sick patient here, Nurse.

636
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,711
Prepare the O.R., stat!

637
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,430
Patient is prepped.

638
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,115
No one's ever attempted
a double bypass...

639
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,913
brain transplant before.

640
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,838
Now for the tricky part.
Pliers!

641
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,428
I don't believe that man's
ever been to medical school.

642
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,714
Doctor, you've done it!

643
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,998
Hannah!

644
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,793
Janie's all better now.

645
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,992
- Mom! Mom!
- She's lying!

646
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,588
Whatever she says,
it's not true!

647
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,794
We are gonna die.
I'm outta here!

648
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,150
Locked!

649
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,840
There's gotta be
another way outta here.

650
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,311
Uh, Buzz, was that you?

651
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,550
Hey, hi there,
little fella.

652
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,636
Come out here.
Do you know a way outta here?

653
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,838
Bu-Bu-Bu-Buzz!

654
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,755
They're cannibals.

655
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,870
Mayday, mayday. Come in,
Star Command. Send reinforcements.

656
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,560
Star Command, do you copy?

657
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,796
I've set my laser
from stun to kill.

658
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,357
Ah, great, great. Yeah, and if anyone
attacks us, we can blink 'em to death.

659
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,797
Hey, you guys, I think
I found him. Buzz, is that you?

660
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,115
Whiskers, will you
get out of here!

661
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,959
You're interfering
with a search and rescue!

662
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,310
Look! They're home.

663
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,117
- Mom, have you seen Woody?
- Where was the last place you left him?

664
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,515
- Right here in the van.
- I'm sure he's there.

665
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,232
You're just not looking
hard enough.

666
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,750
He's not here, Mom.
Woody's gone!

667
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,678
- Woody's gone?
- Yeah, boy, the weasel ran away.

668
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,791
Huh? Huh?
I told you he was guilty.

669
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,754
Who would've thought he was
capable of such atrocities?

670
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,074
Oh, Slink,
I hope he's okay.

671
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,509
Oh, a survivor!

672
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,790
Where's the rebel base?
Talk!

673
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,720
I can see your will
is strong.

674
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,077
Well, we have ways
of making you talk.

675
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,149
Where are your
rebel friends now?

676
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,034
- Sid, your Pop Tarts are ready!
- All right!

677
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,875
Are you all right?
I'm proud of you, Sheriff.

678
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,117
A lesser man would've
talked under such torture.

679
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,595
I sure hope this
isn't permanent.

680
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,234
Still no word from Star Command.
We're not that far from the spaceport.

681
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,113
The door. It's open!
We're free!

682
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,595
- Woody, we don't know what's out there!
- I'll tell you wha...

683
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,871
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!
Do something, quick!

684
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,911
Shield your eyes!

685
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,275
It's not working. I recharged it
before I left. l-It should be good for...

686
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,915
You idiot, you're a toy!
Use your karate-chop action!

687
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:43,658
Get away!

688
00:42:43,659 --> 00:42:46,376
Hey! Hey! How're you doin' that?
Stop that!

689
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,194
- Back! Back, you savages! Back!
- Woody, stop it.

690
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,118
Sorry, guys,
but dinner's cancelled.

691
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,595
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.

692
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,678
There's no place like home!

693
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,155
Another stunt like that, cowboy,
and you're gonna get us killed.

694
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,511
- Don't tell me what to do.
- Shh!

695
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,839
<i>Yee-haw! Giddyap, partner!</i>

696
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,873
<i>We got to get this
wagon train a-movin'!</i>

697
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,198
Split up!

698
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:09,393
<i>Calling Buzz Lightyear. Come in,
Buzz Lightyear. This is Star Command.</i>

699
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,317
<i>- Buzz Lightyear, Star Command!
- do you read me?</i>

700
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,476
<i>Buzz Lightyear responding.
Read you loud and clear.</i>

701
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,955
<i>Buzz Lightyear,
planet Earth needs your help!</i>

702
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,036
<i>- On the way!
- Buzz Lightyear!</i>

703
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,278
<i>The world's greatest superhero,
now the world's greatest toy!</i>

704
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,153
<i>Buzz has it all!
Locking wrist communicator!</i>

705
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,919
<i>- Calling Buzz Lightyear!
- Karate-chop action!</i>

706
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,837
<i>- Wow!
- Pulsating laser light!</i>

707
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,032
<i>- Total annihilation!
- Multi-phrase voice simulator!</i>

708
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,071
<i>There's a secret mission
in uncharted space.</i>

709
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,997
<i>There's a secret mission
in uncharted space.</i>

710
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,510
<i>And best of all,
high pressure space wings!</i>

711
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,076
<i>- To infinity and beyond!
- Not a flying toy.</i>

712
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,476
<i>Get your Buzz Lightyear action figure
and save a galaxy near you!</i>

713
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,955
<i>Buzz Lightyear!</i>

714
00:44:49,956 --> 00:44:52,310
<i>Available at all Al's Toy Barn outlets
in the Tri-county area.</i>

715
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,273
<i># Out among the stars I sit #</i>

716
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,234
<i># Way beyond the moon #</i>

717
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:11,592
<i># In my silver ship I sail #</i>

718
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,713
<i># To a dream #

719
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,910
<i># Now I know #</i>

720
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:22,238
<i># Exactly who I am #
# and what I'm here for #</i>

721
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,352
You are a toy!
You can't fly!

722
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:32,520
<i># And I will go sailing #</i>

723
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,279
<i># No more #</i>

724
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,269
<i># But no #
# It can't be true #</i>

725
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,756
<i># I could fly if I wanted to #</i>

726
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,269
<i># Like a bird in the sky #</i>

727
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,153
<i># If I believed I could fly #</i>

728
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,794
<i># Why, I'd fly #</i>

729
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,559
To infinity and beyond!

730
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,030
<i># Clearly I #</i>

731
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:20,790
<i># Will go sailing #</i>

732
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,559
<i># No more #</i>

733
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,629
Mom! Mom, have you seen
my Sally doll?

734
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,557
What, dear?
What was that?

735
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,437
Never mind!

736
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,399
Buzz, the coast is clear.
Buzz, where are you?

737
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,796
<i> There's a secret mission
in uncharted space. Let's go.</i>

738
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,232
Really? That is
so interesting.

739
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,079
Would you like some tea,
Mrs. Nesbitt?

740
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:05,735
Buzz!

741
00:47:05,736 --> 00:47:08,670
It's so nice you could
join us on such late notice.

742
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,634
- Oh, no.
- What a lovely hat, Mrs. Nesbitt.

743
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,399
It goes quite well
with your head.

744
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,034
Hannah! Oh, Hannah!

745
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:22,119
Mom? Please excuse me, ladies.
I'll be right back.

746
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,076
What is it, Mom?

747
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,713
Mom, where are you?

748
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,400
Buzz! Hey! Buzz, are you okay?

749
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,512
Gone! It's all gone.

750
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,313
All of it's gone.
Bye-bye. Whoo-whoo. See ya.

751
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,035
- What happened to you?
- One minute you're defending the whole galaxy,

752
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,835
and suddenly you find yourself
suckin' down Darjeeling...

753
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,952
with Marie Antoinette
and her little sister.

754
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,150
I think you've had enough tea
for today.

755
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:55,397
- Let's get you outta here, Buzz.
- Don't you get it?

756
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:00,310
You see the hat?
I am Mrs. Nesbitt!

757
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,476
Snap out of it, Buzz!

758
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,396
l-l-I'm... I'm sorry, l...
You're right.

759
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,351
I am just a little depressed, that's all.
l...

760
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,351
l-I can get through this.

761
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,879
- Oh, I'm a sham!
- Shh!

762
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,558
- Look at me.
- Quiet, Buzz!

763
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,035
I can't even fly out
of a window.

764
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,072
But the hat looked good?
Tell me the hat looked good.

765
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,237
- The apron is a bit much.
- Out the window!

766
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,955
Buzz, you're a genius!
Come on, come on. This way.

767
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:31,311
Years of academy training
wasted!

768
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,760
- B-3.
- Miss! G-6.

769
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,030
Ohh! You sunk it!

770
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,754
- Are you peeking?
- Oh, quit your whining and pay up.

771
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,757
No, no, not the ear.
Give me the nose. Come on.

772
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,279
How about three out of five?

773
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,716
Hey, guys! Guys!

774
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,990
- Hey!
- Son of a building block!

775
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,236
- It's Woody.
- He's in the psycho's bedroom.

776
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,510
- H-H-Hi!
- Everyone! It's Woody!

777
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,698
- Woody?
- You're kidding!

778
00:48:54,699 --> 00:48:55,756
Woody!

779
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,055
We're gonna get out
of here, Buzz.

780
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,554
Buzz?

781
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,519
- Hey, look!
- Woody!

782
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,676
Oh, boy, am I glad
to see you guys!

783
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,268
- I knew you'd come back, Woody!
- What are you doin' over there?

784
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,709
It's a long story, Bo.
I'll explain later.

785
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,558
Here! Catch this!

786
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,948
Whoa! I got it, Woody!

787
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,514
- He got it, Woody!
- Good goin', Slink!

788
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,835
- Now just, just tie it on to somethin'.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

789
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,075
- I got a better idea.
How about we don't?

790
00:49:23,176 --> 00:49:23,791
Hey!

791
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,832
- Potato Head!
- Did you all take stupid pills this morning?

792
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,695
Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?

793
00:49:28,696 --> 00:49:30,430
And now you want
to let him back over here?

794
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,596
No! No, no. No, no, no, no, no.
You got it...

795
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,711
You got it all wrong,
Potato Head.

796
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,876
Buzz is fine. Buzz is
right here. He's with me.

797
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,514
- You are a liar!
- No, I'm not!

798
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,494
Buzz, come over here and j-just
tell the nice toys

799
00:49:41,495 --> 00:49:43,349
that you're...
that you're not dead.

800
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,792
Just a sec! Buzz, will you
get up here and give me a hand?

801
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,116
That's very funny, Buzz.
This is serious!

802
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,196
Hey, Woody, where'd ya go?

803
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,709
He's lying. Buzz ain't there.

804
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:04,960
Oh, hi, Buzz. Why don't you
say hello to the guys over there?

805
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:08,277
Hiya, fellas!
To infinity and beyond!

806
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,072
Hey, look! It's Buzz!

807
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:15,194
Yeah! Hey, Buzz, let's show the guys
our new secret best-friends handshake.

808
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,515
- Give me five, man!
- Something's screwy here.

809
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,598
So you see, we're friends now,
guys. Aren't we, Buzz?

810
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,392
You bet. Give me a hug.

811
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,558
- Oh, I love you too.
- See? It is Buzz.

812
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,433
- Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
- Wait just a minute.

813
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,915
- What are you tryin' to pull?
- Nothin'.

814
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,997
- Oh, that is disgusting.
- Murderer!

815
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,270
- No! No, no, no, no, no!
- You murdering dog!

816
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,391
- It's not what you think, I swear!
- Save it for the jury!

817
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,715
I hope Sid pulls
your voice box out, you creep.

818
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,796
No! No! No, no! Don't leave!
Don't leave! Y-Ya gotta help us, please!

819
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:51,153
- You don't know what it's like over here!
- Come on, let's get out of here.

820
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,635
Go back to your lives, citizens.
Show's over.

821
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,035
Come back! Slink!

822
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:00,073
Slink, please!
Please listen to me!

823
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,316
No! No, come back!

824
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,073
Slinky!

825
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,912
Buzz!

826
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,235
Go away, you disgusting freaks!

827
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,836
All right, back!
Back, you cannibals!

828
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:30,075
He is still alive and you're...
you're not gonna get him, you monsters!

829
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,031
What are you doin'?

830
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,436
Hey. Hey, they fixed you.

831
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:43,311
But... But they're cannibals.
We saw them eat those other toys.

832
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:55,156
Uh, sorry. l-l-I thought
that you were gonna,

833
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,396
you kn...
you know, eat my friend.

834
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,715
Hey, no, no. Hey. Hey!
What's wrong?

835
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,956
- Sid!
- Not now, Mom! I'm busy!

836
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,957
Sid!

837
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,355
Buzz, come on, get up!
Use your legs!

838
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,631
Fine! Let Sid trash you!
But don't blame me!

839
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,478
It came! It finally came!

840
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,237
"The Big One."

841
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:26,436
"Extremely dangerous.
Keep out of reach of children."

842
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,197
Cool! What am I gonna blow?

843
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,232
Man! Hey, where's that
wimpy cowboy doll?

844
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,637
Yes.

845
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,911
I've always wanted to put
a spaceman into orbit.

846
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,439
Yes.

847
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,435
Oh, no!

848
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,676
Oh, man!

849
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,352
Sid Phillips reporting.

850
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,473
Launch of the shuttle has been delayed due to
adverse weather conditions at the launch site.

851
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,478
Tomorrow's forecast? Sunny.

852
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,597
Sweet dreams.

853
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,751
I looked everywhere, honey,
but all I could find was your hat.

854
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,950
W-What if we leave them behind?

855
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,877
Oh, don't worry, honey.

856
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,310
I'm sure we'll find Woody and
Buzz before we leave tomorrow.

857
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,278
- I need air.
- Will you quit moving around?

858
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,949
I'm sorry. It's just that I get...
I get so nervous before I travel.

859
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,435
How did I get stuck with you
as a moving buddy?

860
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,312
Everyone else was picked.

861
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,270
Oh, Woody.

862
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,029
If only you could see
how much Andy misses you.

863
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,718
Psst! Psst! Hey, Buzz!

864
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,397
Hey. Get over here and see
if you can get this tool box off me.

865
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,279
Oh, come on, Buzz, l...

866
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,153
Buzz, I can't do this
without you.

867
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,429
I need your help.

868
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,032
I can't help.
I can't help anyone.

869
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,879
Why, sure you can, Buzz.
You can get me out of here.

870
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,833
And then I'll get that rocket off you
and we'll make a break for Andy's house.

871
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,077
Andy's house, Sid's house.
What's the difference?

872
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:12,273
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall.
Y-You must not be thinking clearly.

873
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,995
No, Woody, for the first time
I am thinking clearly.

874
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,588
You were right all along.
I'm not a Space Ranger.

875
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:22,559
I'm just a toy.
A stupid little insignificant toy.

876
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:23,738
Whoa. Hey.
Wait a minute.

877
00:55:23,939 --> 00:55:27,396
Being a toy is a lot better than
being a, a Space Ranger.

878
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,351
- Yeah, right.
- No, it is.

879
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,756
Look, over in that house is a kid
who thinks you are the greatest,

880
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,314
and it's not because
you're a Space Ranger, pal.

881
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,910
It's because you're a toy.
You are his toy.

882
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:42,430
- But why would Andy want me?
- Why would Andy want you?

883
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:45,518
Look at you!
You're a Buzz Lightyear!

884
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,518
Any other toy would give up
his moving parts just to be you.

885
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,030
You've got wings!
You glow in the dark! You talk!

886
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,835
Your helmet does that...
that... that "whoosh" thing.

887
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,030
You are a cool toy.

888
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,956
As a matter of fact,
you're too cool.

889
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:08,072
I mean... I mean, what chance
does a toy like me have...

890
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,237
against a Buzz Lightyear
action figure?

891
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,954
All I can do is...

892
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,310
<i>There's a snake in my boots!</i>

893
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,949
Why would Andy ever want to
play with me when he's got you?

894
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,675
I'm the one that should be
strapped to that rocket.

895
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:54,235
Listen, Buzz, forget about me. You
should get out of here while you can.

896
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,919
- Buzz, what are you doin'? I thought you...
- Come on, Sheriff.

897
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,350
There's a kid over in that house who needs us.
Now let's get you out of this thing.

898
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,993
- Hit it!
- Yes, sir!

899
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,716
Come on, Buzz, we can do it.

900
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:28,030
- Woody! It's the moving van!
- We gotta get out of here now.

901
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,319
Come on, Buzz.

902
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,475
All right.

903
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,751
- Buzz. Hey, I'm out!
- Almost there.

904
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,958
I wanna ride the pony.

905
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,469
Whew.

906
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,433
Woody. Woody, are you all right?

907
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,074
No, I'm fine. I'm okay.

908
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,918
Oh, yeah!

909
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,395
Time for liftoff! Whoo!

910
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:19,831
To infinity and beyond!
Whoo-hoo!

911
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,116
Back! Back!

912
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,356
Down! Down!

913
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:34,233
Okay, what do I do?
Come on, Woody, think.

914
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,110
Guys!

915
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,629
No, no, no, no, wait!
Wait. Listen. Please!

916
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,799
There's a good toy down there and he's...
he's gonna be blown to bits in a few minutes,

917
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,751
all because of me.

918
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,199
We gotta save him.

919
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,118
But I need your help.

920
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:01,675
Please. He's my friend.

921
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,553
He's the only one I've got.

922
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,359
Thank you.

923
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,471
Okay, I think I know
what to do.

924
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:25,513
We're going to have to break a few rules,
but if it works it'll help everybody.

925
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,639
Houston to Mission Control.
Come in, Control.

926
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,354
Launchpad is being constructed.

927
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,234
All right, listen up.
I need Pump Boy here.

928
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,271
Ducky, here. Legs?

929
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,151
You're with Ducky.

930
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,350
RollerBob and I don't move
'til we get the signal. Clear?

931
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,795
Okay. Let's move!

932
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,116
Wind the frog!

933
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,390
Wait for the signal.

934
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:58,519
Go!

935
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,717
All right, let's go!

936
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,751
I'll get it!

937
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,030
Now!

938
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,355
I'm coming, I'm coming.

939
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,198
Whoa! Scud!

940
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,639
Stupid dog.

941
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,958
Lean back!

942
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,431
Uh, Mission Control, is the launchpad
construction complete?

943
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:45,472
Uh, roger. Rocket is now
secured to guide wire.

944
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:48,990
We are currently obtaining
the ignition sticks.

945
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:51,014
Countdown will commence momentarily.
Stand by.

946
01:01:51,015 --> 01:01:52,908
Let's go.

947
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,600
Hey, Mom!
Where are the matches?

948
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:58,314
- Oh, wait, here they are. Never mind!
- Woody! Great!

949
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,158
- Help me out of this thing.
- Shh!

950
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:03,238
- What?
- It's okay. Everything's under control.

951
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:07,717
- Woody, what are you doing?
- Houston, all systems are go.

952
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,956
Requesting permission to launch.

953
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,588
Hey. How'd you get out here?

954
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:17,793
Oh, well. You and I
can have a cookout later.

955
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,994
Houston, do we have
permission to launch?

956
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,758
Uh, roger. Permission granted.

957
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:29,350
You are confirmed
at T-minus ten seconds...

958
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:31,919
and counting.

959
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:35,589
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

960
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:40,271
six, five, four, three,
two, one...

961
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,995
<i>Reach for the sky.</i>

962
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:48,352
<i>- Huh?
- This town ain't big enough for the two of us.</i>

963
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,799
What?

964
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,354
<i>Somebody's poisoned
the water hole.</i>

965
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,393
<i>- It's busted.
- Who are you calling "busted,"buster?</i>

966
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,238
<i>- Huh?
- That's right.</i>

967
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:01,750
<i>- I'm talking to you, Sid Phillips.
- Huh?</i>

968
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:04,599
<i>We don't like
bein' blown up, Sid.</i>

969
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,188
<i>- Or smashed. Or ripped apart.
- We?</i>

970
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:09,515
<i>That's right. Your toys.</i>

971
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,429
Mama! Mama!

972
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:17,552
Mama! Mama!

973
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,312
Mama!

974
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:44,558
<i>From now on you must take
good care of your toys,</i>

975
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:48,673
<i>because if you don't,
we'll find out, Sid.</i>

976
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:54,193
<i>We toys can see everything.</i>

977
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:57,830
So play nice.

978
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:07,470
We did it! We did it! Yes!

979
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:10,034
The toys! The toys are alive!

980
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,515
N-Nice toy.

981
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,796
What's wrong, Sid? Don't you
want to play with Sally?

982
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,710
Nice work, fellas. Good job.

983
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:25,308
Coming out of the ground... what a touch.
That was a stroke of genius.

984
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,998
Woody.

985
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,117
Thanks.

986
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,351
Everybody say, "Bye, House!"

987
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,277
- Woody! The van!
- Bye, House.

988
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,038
We gotta run! Thanks, guys!

989
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,594
Quick!

990
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,718
Just go! I'll catch up!

991
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:12,789
Come on!

992
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:28,834
You can do it, Woody!

993
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,791
I made it.

994
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:43,916
Ow! Get away, you stupid dog!
Down! Down!

995
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,076
Hold on, Woody!

996
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,192
I can't do it.

997
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,754
Take care of Andy for me!

998
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:54,394
No!

999
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,873
Buzz!

1000
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,258
- Ow!
- Are we there already?

1001
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,356
- Woody?
- Woody!

1002
01:06:24,357 --> 01:06:25,432
- How did you...
- How'd he get here?

1003
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:28,074
- Where have you... What happened... Ow!
- What's goin' on?

1004
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:31,636
- What's the... What's he takin'?
- Aha! There you are!

1005
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,239
Hey, what's he doing?

1006
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,079
He's at it again!

1007
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:51,470
- Get him!
- Come on!

1008
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:53,875
Get him!

1009
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,517
Aah! Aah! No! No!

1010
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:07,792
No, no, no, no, wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1011
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,677
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1012
01:07:09,678 --> 01:07:11,435
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1013
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,313
Pig pile!

1014
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:39,669
- Get out of that car!
- Move it!

1015
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,555
- Whew.
- No, please! You don't understand!

1016
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,433
Buzz is out there!
We gotta help him!

1017
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:49,791
- Toss him overboard!
- No, no, no, no! Wait! Aaah!

1018
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,953
- Hooray!
- So long, Woody!

1019
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,839
- Ohh, Woody!
- Ohh!

1020
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:05,635
- Oh! Well, thanks for the ride!
- Look out! Aaaah!

1021
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,795
Now let's catch up
to that truck!

1022
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:20,393
- Guys! Guys! Woody's riding R.C.!
- What?

1023
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,351
And Buzz is with him!

1024
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:23,913
- Ohh!
- What? Buzz?

1025
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:29,437
It is Buzz!
Woody was telling the truth!

1026
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:32,472
- What have we done?
- Great! Now I have guilt!

1027
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:35,831
We're almost there!

1028
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:39,839
- Rocky, the ramp!
- Come on, Woody, Buzz! You can do it!

1029
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,990
Look out!

1030
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:50,554
Quick! Hold on to my tail!

1031
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,831
Atta boy, Slink!

1032
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:59,838
Uhh! Woody!

1033
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,916
- Woody, speed up!
- Speed up!

1034
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:04,759
The batteries!
They're running out!

1035
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,677
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1036
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:11,111
- Whoa!
- Aaaah!

1037
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,470
<i># Hakuna Matata</i>

1038
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,160
<i># What a wonderful phrase</i>

1039
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:22,190
I can't hold on much longer!

1040
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,436
Slink, hang on!

1041
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,358
Ouch!

1042
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,871
Great.

1043
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:46,078
- Woody! The rocket!
- The match!

1044
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:49,272
Yes! Thank you, Sid!

1045
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,515
No! No, no! No!

1046
01:09:58,640 --> 01:09:59,959
No!

1047
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:03,311
Oh, no, no, no,

1048
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:06,876
no, no, no, no!

1049
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,797
No!

1050
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:20,232
- Woody, what are you doing?
- Hold still, Buzz.

1051
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:26,117
You did it! Next stop, Andy.

1052
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:28,800
Wait a minute.
I just lit a rocket.

1053
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,717
Rockets explode!

1054
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:42,712
I should've held on longer.

1055
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:45,308
Look! Look! It's Woody and Buzz
coming up fast!

1056
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,072
Woody!

1057
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:57,957
Run! Take cover!

1058
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:06,909
Aah! This is the part
where we blow up!

1059
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:09,031
Not today.

1060
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,671
Hey, Buzz! You're flying!

1061
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:24,951
This isn't flying.
This is falling with style.

1062
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,549
To infinity and beyond!

1063
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:39,559
Uh, Buzz, we missed the truck.

1064
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:41,477
We're not aiming for the truck.

1065
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,757
- Hey! Wow!
- What? What is it?

1066
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:51,595
Woody!
Buzz!

1067
01:11:50,996 --> 01:11:53,111
Oh, great! You found 'em.
Where were they?

1068
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:55,017
- Here in the car!
- See?

1069
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:58,352
Now, what did I tell you?
Right where you left 'em.

1070
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,753
- Which one can I open first?
- Let's let Molly open one.

1071
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,514
<i>- Frankincense, this is Myrrh.
- Hey, heads up, everybody!</i>

1072
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,915
- It's show time!
- Oh! It's time!

1073
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:27,074
Oh. Bo. There's gotta be a less
painful way to get my attention.

1074
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:30,192
<i>Merry Christmas, Sheriff.</i>

1075
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,629
<i>- Say, isn't that mistletoe?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

1076
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:38,392
Maybe Andy'll get another
dinosaur, like a leaf eater.

1077
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:41,990
That way I could play
the, uh, dominant predator!

1078
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,873
<i>- Quiet, everyone, quiet.
- Molly's first present is...</i>

1079
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,399
<i>Mrs. Potato Head!</i>

1080
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,829
<i>Repeat, a Mrs. Potato Head!</i>

1081
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:52,350
- Way to go, Idaho!
- Gee, I'd better shave.

1082
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:00,476
<i>Come in, Frankincense. Andy is now
opening his first present. It's...</i>

1083
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:03,472
<i>- Buzz. Buzz Lightyear.
- I can't quite...</i>

1084
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,591
- You are not worried, are you?
- Me? No.

1085
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:09,315
<i>- make out...
- No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Mm-mmm.</i>

1086
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,476
<i>A large box.
It's, it's, it's...</i>

1087
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,114
- Are you?
- Oh, now, Buzz.

1088
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:18,199
What could Andy possibly get
that is worse than you?

1089
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:23,036
Oh, what is it? What is it?
Wow! A puppy!
