1
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:26,222
There has been a war between
orcs and humans

2
00:01:26,247 --> 00:01:28,845
for as long as
can be remembered.

3
00:01:32,673 --> 00:01:34,199
But there was once a time,

4
00:01:34,224 --> 00:01:37,562
when we did not even know
who our enemy was.

5
00:01:39,663 --> 00:01:44,045
Or what that evil green magic,
the fel, had done to us.

6
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:59,030
But in the beginning,
how could we have known.

7
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,580
What choice did we have?

8
00:02:03,102 --> 00:02:04,920
Our world was dying.

9
00:02:04,945 --> 00:02:08,567
And I had to find my clan
a new home.

10
00:02:16,574 --> 00:02:18,405
Durotan.

11
00:02:18,644 --> 00:02:21,445
I can feel your eyes.

12
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:26,026
I thought you were asleep.

13
00:02:26,517 --> 00:02:28,363
I was.

14
00:02:33,297 --> 00:02:38,341
Dreaming of a hunt,
through the snow.

15
00:02:45,764 --> 00:02:47,778
I thought of a name.

16
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:51,812
Well. Keep it to yourself, wife.

17
00:02:51,844 --> 00:02:54,031
I'll choose a name
when I meet him.

18
00:02:54,477 --> 00:02:56,196
Or her.

19
00:02:56,655 --> 00:02:58,070
Oh.

20
00:02:58,392 --> 00:03:01,765
And how will the great
Durotan name his son?

21
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:04,786
If I do not travel with him.

22
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:06,649
A son?

23
00:03:07,893 --> 00:03:10,273
Can you hide your fat belly?

24
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:16,312
Better than you can
hide your fat head.

25
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:53,082
So many clans from one place, Orgrim.

26
00:03:53,285 --> 00:03:56,358
Laughing skull. Black rock.

27
00:03:56,383 --> 00:03:58,116
All have been summoned.

28
00:03:58,141 --> 00:04:00,770
It will be a mighty warband.

29
00:04:01,164 --> 00:04:04,061
I just wonder
who's left to fight?

30
00:04:04,086 --> 00:04:06,196
Lok'tar ogar!
(Victory or death!)

31
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:09,540
Victory or death!

32
00:04:11,486 --> 00:04:13,803
Black rock, over there.

33
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:16,650
How much longer, Blackhand?

34
00:04:16,842 --> 00:04:19,179
We are ready, Gul'dan.

35
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,415
Help me.

36
00:04:21,446 --> 00:04:24,511
My child. Please let him go.

37
00:04:24,536 --> 00:04:26,305
I beg you.

38
00:04:26,693 --> 00:04:29,000
What did she say?

39
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:32,556
She begs for you
to free her child.

40
00:04:32,581 --> 00:04:36,850
But I need him.
I need all of them.

41
00:04:55,549 --> 00:04:57,954
Move, half breed.

42
00:05:05,293 --> 00:05:09,100
- What is that?
- Gul'dan's magic.

43
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:25,505
The fuel of my magic is life.

44
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:31,306
We only have enough prisoners to
send through our strongest warriors.

45
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:36,554
But that will be enough.
The enemy is weak.

46
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:42,217
When we arrive,
we will take them as fuel.

47
00:05:45,591 --> 00:05:49,967
We will build a new portal.
And when it is complete,

48
00:05:49,992 --> 00:05:56,365
we will bring through all...
of the Horde.

49
00:06:50,255 --> 00:06:52,338
Let me go first.

50
00:06:58,993 --> 00:07:01,217
For the Horde!

51
00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:59,859
With child?

52
00:07:59,884 --> 00:08:03,967
You dare bring that burden
into my war band!

53
00:08:05,309 --> 00:08:08,787
Let me go, Blackhand. Draka!

54
00:08:23,282 --> 00:08:26,851
Push, little one. Push.

55
00:08:35,362 --> 00:08:36,793
My son.

56
00:09:06,105 --> 00:09:09,754
A new warrior for the Horde.

57
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:26,513
WARCRAFT

58
00:09:30,372 --> 00:09:34,056
IRONGORGE

59
00:09:35,914 --> 00:09:40,314
Lothar, come.
I have got something for you.

60
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,817
- What is it?
- A mechanical marvel.

61
00:09:49,842 --> 00:09:52,706
It's a boomstick.

62
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,148
Odd.

63
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:06,098
Take water.

64
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:16,387
You might want to
head home, big man.

65
00:10:17,165 --> 00:10:20,103
Someone has attacked
one of your garrisons.

66
00:10:20,128 --> 00:10:23,420
It seems your king
needs you, commander.

67
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:36,594
Stormwind

68
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:40,441
The entire garrison,
and no one saw anything.

69
00:10:40,466 --> 00:10:42,073
We did find someone.

70
00:10:42,098 --> 00:10:45,679
He was searching the bodies,
here, in the barracks.

71
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,586
In the barracks?

72
00:10:51,563 --> 00:10:54,440
Finally. Are you in command?

73
00:10:58,609 --> 00:11:00,153
.

74
00:11:03,336 --> 00:11:05,843
That's the mark of the Kirin Tor.

75
00:11:06,152 --> 00:11:09,025
What are you doing in my city,
spell chucker?

76
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,656
Let me complete my examination
of the body across the hall.

77
00:11:18,703 --> 00:11:20,736
Now why would I do that?

78
00:11:20,761 --> 00:11:24,126
Within that body is the
secret to your attacks.

79
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,620
What was that?

80
00:11:46,669 --> 00:11:48,523
You must summon the Guardian.

81
00:11:48,548 --> 00:11:50,109
Medivh?

82
00:11:50,134 --> 00:11:52,238
It should be he who explains it.

83
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,757
Only the king summons the Guardian.

84
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,325
Get him to Goldshire.

85
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,606
- What kind of beasts?
- Rumors, your Majesty.

86
00:12:27,631 --> 00:12:30,279
How does a garrison of 30 men
disappear without a whisper.

87
00:12:30,304 --> 00:12:31,780
The fel.

88
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,235
Or at least it's influence.

89
00:12:37,763 --> 00:12:39,477
Is this him?

90
00:12:40,623 --> 00:12:42,304
Your Majesty.

91
00:12:43,734 --> 00:12:45,227
Dad.

92
00:12:45,657 --> 00:12:47,449
Thank you, son.

93
00:12:48,093 --> 00:12:50,630
So who are you, mage?

94
00:12:51,293 --> 00:12:54,301
My name is Khadgar.
I'm a Guardian novitiate.

95
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:56,203
I was. I renounced my vows.

96
00:12:56,228 --> 00:12:58,000
You mean you're a fugitive?

97
00:12:58,025 --> 00:13:00,001
I'm not hiding.

98
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,022
Your Majesty.

99
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,696
I may have left my training but
I didn't leave my abilities behind.

100
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,478
I senses something.

101
00:13:09,087 --> 00:13:13,176
Dark forces, when it's strong it...
almost has a smell.

102
00:13:13,201 --> 00:13:17,041
Knowing that something so evil was
so close I couldn't just ignore it.

103
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:19,154
What's going on out there?

104
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:22,088
Smoke, Sir. The southeast.

105
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,986
Your Majesty, I urge you to engage
the Guardian with all haste.

106
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,721
- They've reached Elwynn Forest.
- The Grand Hamlet is burning.

107
00:13:33,485 --> 00:13:35,048
An attack?

108
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,951
- What?
- Stop requesting Callan.

109
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:43,037
Stay out of my business.

110
00:13:43,062 --> 00:13:46,242
He wants to follow in
his father's footsteps.

111
00:13:46,267 --> 00:13:48,342
My son doesn't need your help.

112
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:51,237
Tread carefully when
you talk to your queen.

113
00:13:54,851 --> 00:13:57,325
You are my sister first.

114
00:13:59,185 --> 00:14:01,400
When was your last visit to Karazhan?

115
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:05,069
With you.
I don't know... 6 years?

116
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,263
And you had no contact
with Medivh since?

117
00:14:07,288 --> 00:14:09,196
Not for the lack of trying.

118
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:10,514
Well.

119
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,468
He can't hide from us now.

120
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,192
The Guardian is summoned.

121
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,146
Get on.

122
00:14:42,455 --> 00:14:43,971
Good luck.

123
00:14:47,716 --> 00:14:49,413
Okay.

124
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,566
Let me go!

125
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,890
Frostwolves do not join the hunt?

126
00:15:25,735 --> 00:15:29,354
We prefer our enemies armed
with an axe, not a child.

127
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:35,084
We have been commanded, Durotan.
Respect the old ways.

128
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,005
There must be a worthy foe
somewhere on this dung heap.

129
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,370
Find them all!

130
00:15:42,395 --> 00:15:46,014
Try not to kill too many,
we need them alive.

131
00:16:18,543 --> 00:16:20,221
Lothar.

132
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:22,011
Moroes.

133
00:16:22,201 --> 00:16:26,365
Look at you.
You haven't aged a bit.

134
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,496
Where is everyone?

135
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:38,060
Many things have changed.

136
00:16:38,085 --> 00:16:40,861
The power that must be locked away here,
the knowledge.

137
00:16:40,886 --> 00:16:42,791
Where is he?

138
00:16:43,593 --> 00:16:46,202
I didn't know so many books
even existed.

139
00:16:47,317 --> 00:16:48,921
Wait here.

140
00:16:49,517 --> 00:16:52,048
And try not to touch anything.

141
00:16:52,703 --> 00:16:56,530
- He sees no one?
- The world's been at peace.

142
00:16:58,136 --> 00:17:00,063
Good you are here, Lothar.

143
00:17:00,088 --> 00:17:01,649
It would do the Guardian
a world of good

144
00:17:01,674 --> 00:17:04,767
to see a friendly face
beyond this old one.

145
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:10,138
He can't refuse you...
nor King Wrynn.

146
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,444
Not if he's summoned.

147
00:17:14,353 --> 00:17:15,767
Chop chop.

148
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,185
Did you summon him, Moroes?

149
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:52,567
No. He did not.

150
00:17:57,936 --> 00:18:02,915
So. You become a sculptor?

151
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,213
I'm making a golem.

152
00:18:05,823 --> 00:18:10,386
It usually takes years of magic
to sip into the clay, but up here it's...

153
00:18:10,411 --> 00:18:12,266
much faster.

154
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:19,328
Makes someone to keep Moroes company.
Help to clean up around the house.

155
00:18:19,881 --> 00:18:21,541
Thank you.

156
00:18:25,261 --> 00:18:27,667
It's good to see you, Lothar.

157
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:30,590
We need your guidance, Medivh.

158
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:33,846
Our king summons you.

159
00:18:35,068 --> 00:18:37,295
Who's the boy downstairs?

160
00:18:45,188 --> 00:18:46,832
Hello?

161
00:18:48,445 --> 00:18:50,061
Guardian?

162
00:19:43,145 --> 00:19:45,145
Have a good look around?

163
00:19:49,824 --> 00:19:52,968
Getting some ideas what you are going to
do with the place once it's yours?

164
00:19:52,993 --> 00:19:56,700
Guardian, I've renounced my vow.

165
00:19:58,925 --> 00:20:02,373
I didn't want to come here.
I swear, Guardian.

166
00:20:02,398 --> 00:20:04,863
I urged them to find you.
I told them...

167
00:20:04,888 --> 00:20:06,816
you should be
the one to explain.

168
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:08,273
Explain what?

169
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:09,857
Fel!

170
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:15,577
In Azeroth?

171
00:20:15,602 --> 00:20:17,751
In the barracks,
one of the bodies.

172
00:20:17,776 --> 00:20:20,153
Guardian, what is the fel?

173
00:20:21,381 --> 00:20:26,014
A magic unlike any other.
It feeds on life itself.

174
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:29,537
It pollutes the user,
twisting everything it touches.

175
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:34,176
It promises great power but
it exacts a terrible price.

176
00:20:34,528 --> 00:20:37,560
There is no place for
the fel in Azeroth.

177
00:20:39,117 --> 00:20:41,148
You've done the right thing.

178
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:43,957
We'll go.

179
00:20:53,989 --> 00:20:56,695
Hey. Go home, you.

180
00:21:04,716 --> 00:21:06,423
Step in.

181
00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:25,147
- Medivh.
- Your Grace.

182
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:27,860
It has been too long.

183
00:21:30,449 --> 00:21:31,863
Come.

184
00:21:31,888 --> 00:21:34,642
Help us get to the roots
of these troubles about.

185
00:21:37,668 --> 00:21:41,565
- What kind of beasts?
- They are saying giants.

186
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,138
Armed giants.
Wolves to carry them.

187
00:21:44,163 --> 00:21:45,809
Huge unstoppable monsters

188
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:49,190
What are the other kingdoms?
Are they suffering the same?

189
00:21:49,215 --> 00:21:52,872
All seek our protection yet not trust
us enough to tell us anything.

190
00:21:52,897 --> 00:21:56,207
We know nothing about
these so call monsters.

191
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:57,878
We need prisoners.

192
00:21:57,903 --> 00:22:00,422
Even a corpse
can tell us something.

193
00:22:01,941 --> 00:22:04,598
I don't know what danger
we're in, Medivh.

194
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:07,639
I exist to protect this realm, my lord.

195
00:22:07,901 --> 00:22:10,141
It is my very purpose.

196
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,066
I am the Guardian.

197
00:22:12,091 --> 00:22:14,570
At least for the time being anyhow.

198
00:22:15,654 --> 00:22:17,113
Yes.

199
00:22:17,262 --> 00:22:21,036
What are we going to do about...
What is his name?

200
00:22:21,061 --> 00:22:23,065
Khadgar, sire.

201
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,478
He'll be coming with us.

202
00:22:29,192 --> 00:22:30,858
Well then.

203
00:22:31,823 --> 00:22:33,451
We better get going.

204
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:36,548
ELWYNN FOREST

205
00:23:03,447 --> 00:23:04,733
Halt!

206
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,025
It can't be.

207
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,919
- What is this?
- Can't tell from the look of it.

208
00:23:43,053 --> 00:23:44,532
.

209
00:23:44,557 --> 00:23:45,960
Guardian.

210
00:23:47,256 --> 00:23:48,851
Close ranks!

211
00:23:48,876 --> 00:23:50,641
Watch your back!

212
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,944
Victory or death!

213
00:24:00,275 --> 00:24:02,501
Watch the flank to your left!

214
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,812
Watch your flank!

215
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:18,601
- Watch your flank!
- To your left!

216
00:24:27,948 --> 00:24:29,738
Guardian!

217
00:24:48,707 --> 00:24:51,131
Now you die, you beast!

218
00:24:57,901 --> 00:25:00,427
Don't try and take them on
with brute force.

219
00:25:02,424 --> 00:25:05,106
They are stronger. Be smarter.

220
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:46,236
The fel.

221
00:25:46,373 --> 00:25:48,212
They're all dying.

222
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,419
Only the green ones!

223
00:25:50,444 --> 00:25:52,603
Kill that big bastard!

224
00:25:59,688 --> 00:26:02,524
Durotan. Move.

225
00:26:13,811 --> 00:26:17,382
Guardian.
Guardian, what did you do?

226
00:26:17,915 --> 00:26:19,815
I was right, wasn't I?
It's here.

227
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,314
- Where are you going?
- Get these men safely back to Stormwind.

228
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:25,594
I've to return to Karazhan.

229
00:26:26,462 --> 00:26:28,427
You did well today.

230
00:26:31,974 --> 00:26:34,492
- Where's the Guardian?
- Karazhan.

231
00:26:34,571 --> 00:26:36,623
We need a prisoner.
Where's your horse?

232
00:26:36,648 --> 00:26:38,753
- Uh. They took my horse.
- Really?

233
00:26:38,777 --> 00:26:40,931
Just stay there.

234
00:28:24,239 --> 00:28:26,581
How much do you
love your master?

235
00:28:27,742 --> 00:28:29,293
I'll do it.

236
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:32,712
Back off!

237
00:28:37,089 --> 00:28:41,116
Pity.
It would have make a good coat.

238
00:28:57,206 --> 00:28:59,233
Over here!

239
00:29:08,962 --> 00:29:11,757
- You took it alone.
- Yes.

240
00:29:12,732 --> 00:29:15,008
Looks like the runt to the litter.

241
00:29:28,438 --> 00:29:30,593
You. What are you?

242
00:29:30,618 --> 00:29:33,110
And why do you attack our lands?

243
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:39,002
- He does not know what you speak.
- You speak our language?

244
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,242
Speak one more word
in their language.

245
00:29:41,267 --> 00:29:44,314
And I will wear your tongue.

246
00:29:55,284 --> 00:29:57,990
I will not warn you again.

247
00:30:02,388 --> 00:30:04,800
- Tell him to stop.
- You tell him.

248
00:30:11,837 --> 00:30:13,485
You're welcome.

249
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:18,993
Have you a name?

250
00:30:21,783 --> 00:30:24,138
You understand our language.

251
00:30:26,108 --> 00:30:29,746
Again, have you a name?

252
00:30:35,321 --> 00:30:37,089
Garona.

253
00:30:37,898 --> 00:30:40,517
She calls herself, Garona.

254
00:30:42,232 --> 00:30:44,210
What kind of being are you?

255
00:30:44,235 --> 00:30:47,579
She seems more like us
than those... beast we fought.

256
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,842
Orc.

257
00:30:48,867 --> 00:30:50,310
Orc?

258
00:30:50,335 --> 00:30:53,705
That's what you are?
Or the beast in the cage was?

259
00:30:55,819 --> 00:30:59,565
I know every races in the Seven Kingdoms.
I've never heard of orc.

260
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:03,995
Show me where you come from.

261
00:31:09,552 --> 00:31:11,725
This is not orc world.

262
00:31:12,027 --> 00:31:14,033
Orc world is dead.

263
00:31:14,533 --> 00:31:16,601
Orcs take this world now.

264
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:18,835
Not from this world.

265
00:31:18,861 --> 00:31:21,347
How did you get here?

266
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:24,228
The great gate.

267
00:31:24,253 --> 00:31:27,158
Deep in ground and through
magic brought us here.

268
00:31:27,183 --> 00:31:29,656
But how did you learn our language?

269
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:31,443
Orc take prisoner for the gate.

270
00:31:31,468 --> 00:31:33,481
- I learn from them.
- Prisoners?

271
00:31:33,506 --> 00:31:36,953
Our people? Are they alive?

272
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,243
Yes.

273
00:31:38,268 --> 00:31:40,113
- Many.
- Why?

274
00:31:40,138 --> 00:31:42,012
To feed the gate.

275
00:31:42,037 --> 00:31:45,280
To bring the Horde
to take your world.

276
00:31:45,305 --> 00:31:47,072
You'll take us to them.

277
00:31:47,793 --> 00:31:49,017
No.

278
00:31:49,042 --> 00:31:54,044
You'll take us to them or you will
end up like your friend in the cage.

279
00:31:58,122 --> 00:32:00,326
You think you are fearsome.

280
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,714
Orc children have pets
more fearsome than you.

281
00:32:03,739 --> 00:32:06,312
We're not trying to be fearsome, Garona.

282
00:32:06,337 --> 00:32:09,774
We are trying to protect
our people, our families.

283
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:13,231
If you help us.
I give you my oath.

284
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:15,399
You will have your freedom.

285
00:32:19,965 --> 00:32:22,635
Fearsome Blackhand.

286
00:32:23,133 --> 00:32:26,099
Warchief of the Horde.

287
00:32:26,455 --> 00:32:31,890
You have allowed the smallteeths
to kill your warriors.

288
00:32:32,314 --> 00:32:33,390
Worse.

289
00:32:33,415 --> 00:32:37,524
You shamed your people
by running from an enemy.

290
00:32:38,847 --> 00:32:42,296
Are you too weak
to talk, destroyer?

291
00:32:42,321 --> 00:32:45,814
The Horde has no use
for weakness.

292
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:49,214
Respect our tradition, warchief.

293
00:32:52,408 --> 00:32:54,915
You know the penalty.

294
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,374
Death.

295
00:33:15,842 --> 00:33:17,151
Done.

296
00:33:19,817 --> 00:33:25,024
- You dare interrupt this judgment?
- We fought hard!

297
00:33:25,449 --> 00:33:28,564
Their warlock use
your fel against us.

298
00:33:28,603 --> 00:33:31,486
Only I can control the fel!

299
00:33:35,742 --> 00:33:39,049
I see you and
your men have survived.

300
00:33:39,074 --> 00:33:44,062
Perhaps Blackhand kept you
safely away from the battlefield.

301
00:33:44,424 --> 00:33:47,747
Maybe he knows you are weak too.

302
00:33:49,251 --> 00:33:53,599
Do you wish to challenge me,
little chieftain.

303
00:33:57,965 --> 00:34:00,232
I do not question, Gul'dan.

304
00:34:00,257 --> 00:34:05,074
But the fel is born of death,
must have a price.

305
00:34:06,626 --> 00:34:09,789
A price paid in lives taken.

306
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:24,184
Will you hold your son?

307
00:34:39,682 --> 00:34:42,278
He will be a great chieftain.

308
00:34:42,303 --> 00:34:46,100
Like his father, a born leader.

309
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,647
I was no leader today.

310
00:34:56,334 --> 00:34:58,963
He challenges you already.

311
00:35:00,038 --> 00:35:03,792
If Gul'dan can infect
born as innocent as he.

312
00:35:03,927 --> 00:35:06,662
What chance do
the rest of us have?

313
00:35:09,892 --> 00:35:12,484
Whatever happens.

314
00:35:12,764 --> 00:35:14,697
Whatever happens.

315
00:35:27,846 --> 00:35:29,644
I see you.

316
00:35:30,686 --> 00:35:34,928
This gate,
who showed it to Gul'dan?

317
00:35:35,188 --> 00:35:37,619
Who lead him to Azeroth?

318
00:35:37,907 --> 00:35:40,205
Gul'dan call him a demon.

319
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,959
Did you see it?

320
00:35:42,261 --> 00:35:45,762
Not the face, but the voice...

321
00:35:46,168 --> 00:35:48,425
Like fire and ash.

322
00:36:04,351 --> 00:36:06,622
I'll be here if you need me.

323
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,388
Your mate.

324
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:27,176
I could kill you before
he even reaches me.

325
00:36:29,797 --> 00:36:31,422
Lothar?

326
00:36:32,412 --> 00:36:34,458
He is my brother.

327
00:36:34,848 --> 00:36:37,409
The king is my mate.

328
00:36:38,441 --> 00:36:40,566
You are the chieftain's wife then?

329
00:36:40,591 --> 00:36:42,556
I suppose so.

330
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,666
Then killing you will bring
me even greater honor.

331
00:36:46,691 --> 00:36:48,569
Not among my kind.

332
00:36:49,739 --> 00:36:51,677
It is a cold night.

333
00:36:51,882 --> 00:36:54,184
I thought you might use these.

334
00:37:04,449 --> 00:37:06,353
It will warm you.

335
00:37:15,106 --> 00:37:17,719
More of our villages burned tonight.

336
00:37:19,724 --> 00:37:22,192
One of them is
the village of my birth.

337
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:28,423
I can not imagine what horrors
you have been through, Garona.

338
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:31,772
But this does not
need to happen.

339
00:37:31,798 --> 00:37:35,190
We have peace in these lands
for many years now.

340
00:37:35,215 --> 00:37:38,460
Peace between races
from all over the world.

341
00:37:44,242 --> 00:37:45,872
What is this?

342
00:37:50,137 --> 00:37:52,357
I can have it removed.

343
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:57,499
There is a life here
for you, Garona.

344
00:37:57,524 --> 00:38:01,600
With us. A life of freedom.

345
00:38:02,682 --> 00:38:04,465
If you want it.

346
00:38:16,552 --> 00:38:18,660
The great gate.

347
00:38:25,728 --> 00:38:32,129
From light comes darkness
and from darkness, light.

348
00:38:32,205 --> 00:38:34,063
Well, that's clear.

349
00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:36,528
Ask Alodi.

350
00:38:36,553 --> 00:38:38,410
Alodi.

351
00:38:52,507 --> 00:38:55,215
Ahh.
It's good to see trees again.

352
00:38:55,812 --> 00:38:57,695
And the snow.

353
00:38:58,068 --> 00:39:00,039
Even from a distance.

354
00:39:01,493 --> 00:39:05,555
Remember when we would track
blood ox through the Frostwind dunes?

355
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:09,626
There was always meat.
Always life.

356
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,833
You don't think it's strange

357
00:39:11,858 --> 00:39:14,932
that we lost our home when
Gul'dan came to power.

358
00:39:14,957 --> 00:39:17,465
One orc could not
kill a world, Durotan.

359
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,268
Are you sure?

360
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:23,955
Look around you.
Does it not remind you of something?

361
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:30,086
Wherever Gul'dan works his magic,
the land dies.

362
00:39:30,623 --> 00:39:35,259
If our people are to make
a home here, my friend.

363
00:39:37,511 --> 00:39:39,777
Gul'dan must be stopped.

364
00:39:41,768 --> 00:39:44,477
We are not powerful
enough to defeat Gul'dan.

365
00:39:44,502 --> 00:39:45,849
No.

366
00:39:47,561 --> 00:39:48,861
No.

367
00:39:52,418 --> 00:39:56,795
But with the humans help,
we could be.

368
00:40:10,622 --> 00:40:12,609
I want that weapon.

369
00:40:16,324 --> 00:40:18,208
You'll have me to protect you.

370
00:40:18,233 --> 00:40:20,506
I need no one to protect me.

371
00:40:26,733 --> 00:40:28,473
What are you looking at?

372
00:41:06,618 --> 00:41:09,090
Bookworm. Take the first watch.

373
00:41:09,115 --> 00:41:11,877
Respectfully, Commander,
my name is Khadgar.

374
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:14,620
My deepest apologies, Khadgar.

375
00:41:14,645 --> 00:41:16,605
You see, I thought
we bonded when

376
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:19,918
I didn't put you in a prison cell
for breaking into royal barracks.

377
00:41:20,863 --> 00:41:22,717
Now take the watch.

378
00:41:36,252 --> 00:41:40,047
Well.
At least you're not reading.

379
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,536
He wishes to lie with me.

380
00:41:47,696 --> 00:41:49,515
I beg your pardon?

381
00:41:50,325 --> 00:41:52,237
You will be injured

382
00:41:52,452 --> 00:41:55,152
- I don't want to lie with you.
- Good.

383
00:41:55,177 --> 00:41:57,452
You would not be
an effective mate.

384
00:41:58,288 --> 00:41:59,980
Why do you laugh?

385
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:03,617
I can't see how you humans
survive such a thing.

386
00:42:03,642 --> 00:42:07,534
No muscles to protect you.
Brittle bones that break.

387
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:09,927
You don't look that
different to us.

388
00:42:10,379 --> 00:42:12,383
How did you survive?

389
00:42:12,408 --> 00:42:14,969
Broken bones heal stronger.

390
00:42:15,576 --> 00:42:17,790
Mine are very strong.

391
00:42:21,468 --> 00:42:22,979
I'm sorry.

392
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:24,978
Do not be.

393
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:32,910
My name, Garona,

394
00:42:33,934 --> 00:42:36,089
it means "cursed" in orc.

395
00:42:40,621 --> 00:42:43,753
My mother was burned alive
for giving birth to me.

396
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:51,150
They kept you alive though.

397
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:53,312
Gul'dan did.

398
00:42:56,250 --> 00:43:01,786
He gave me her tusk
to remember her.

399
00:43:09,516 --> 00:43:13,450
My parents gave me to the Kirin Tor
when I was 6 years old.

400
00:43:14,771 --> 00:43:20,978
That's the last time I saw them or...
any of my brothers and sisters.

401
00:43:23,439 --> 00:43:27,894
It brings a family honor
to offer a child to the Kirin Tor.

402
00:43:28,248 --> 00:43:31,168
To have their son taken up
to the floating city of Dalaran

403
00:43:31,193 --> 00:43:34,835
and be trained by the most
powerful mages in the land.

404
00:43:36,587 --> 00:43:39,471
Less so, to have them run away.

405
00:43:43,542 --> 00:43:48,069
Well. That was cheerful.

406
00:43:50,862 --> 00:43:52,725
The great gate.

407
00:43:55,647 --> 00:43:58,429
Why do they need
so many prisoners?

408
00:43:58,644 --> 00:44:00,878
Like wood for a fire.

409
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:03,928
Green magic takes life
to open the gate.

410
00:44:04,429 --> 00:44:06,588
How many more orcs are
they planning on bringing?

411
00:44:06,613 --> 00:44:10,166
All of them.
This is just a warband.

412
00:44:10,571 --> 00:44:14,948
When the portal is open,
Gul'dan will bring the Horde.

413
00:44:22,153 --> 00:44:24,205
Get them back to Stormwind.

414
00:44:24,702 --> 00:44:26,439
We ride ahead.

415
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:39,969
Garona, we should go.
It's not safe...

416
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:42,498
Durotan.

417
00:44:42,523 --> 00:44:46,704
To the north, there is a black rock
that touches the sky.

418
00:44:47,297 --> 00:44:49,428
I would meet with their leader.

419
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:51,243
To challenge him?

420
00:44:51,268 --> 00:44:54,566
I saw you, lead the smallteeths
to our encampment.

421
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:57,412
They have seen
what is being built.

422
00:44:57,566 --> 00:45:01,932
And only you know, what
Gul'dan has planned for my people.

423
00:45:01,957 --> 00:45:06,739
His magic is death
to all things.

424
00:45:08,198 --> 00:45:10,109
He must be stopped.

425
00:45:11,773 --> 00:45:17,139
Tell him, the black rock,
when the sun is highest.

426
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:18,802
I will.

427
00:45:20,309 --> 00:45:21,804
Chieftain.

428
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:26,862
If I returned, would you
take me into your clan?

429
00:45:28,916 --> 00:45:32,744
You're safer here, with them.

430
00:46:24,242 --> 00:46:26,218
Is it as you feared?

431
00:46:26,243 --> 00:46:31,088
- The fel is everywhere.
- Then you mustn't leave again.

432
00:46:32,799 --> 00:46:36,079
They need the Guardian's help
now more than ever.

433
00:46:37,175 --> 00:46:39,620
Maybe the boy can help.

434
00:46:44,978 --> 00:46:47,348
- We need solution!
- Easy for you to say!

435
00:46:47,373 --> 00:46:52,472
- The Dwarf enforgers must work overtime.
- You treat us no better than dogs.

436
00:46:52,497 --> 00:46:56,185
- We shall supply you no more!
- Enough!

437
00:46:57,282 --> 00:47:01,671
You have all called on Stormwind in
the past either for troops or arbitration.

438
00:47:02,394 --> 00:47:08,250
If we do not unite to fight
this enemy, we will perish.

439
00:47:08,275 --> 00:47:11,730
Stormwind needs soldiers,
arms, horses...

440
00:47:11,755 --> 00:47:14,084
Ha! We have our own
kingdoms to look after.

441
00:47:14,109 --> 00:47:16,907
- Fight your own wars!
- Your Majesty.

442
00:47:17,542 --> 00:47:18,558
Commander.

443
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:22,461
The Orcs are building a portal, through
which they plan to bring an army.

444
00:47:22,486 --> 00:47:26,155
If we do not stop them now,
we may never get another opportunity.

445
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:30,330
Where is he?
Where is the protector of Azeroth?

446
00:47:30,355 --> 00:47:31,639
Where the Guardian?

447
00:47:31,664 --> 00:47:33,433
Where is Medivh?

448
00:47:33,944 --> 00:47:35,698
- My liege.
- I suggest we take a recess.

449
00:47:35,723 --> 00:47:39,617
Take as long as you like.
We're done.

450
00:47:43,448 --> 00:47:45,114
Commander.

451
00:47:45,139 --> 00:47:47,814
What's left of the 4th
has retreated from Stonewatch.

452
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:49,618
What's left?

453
00:47:49,643 --> 00:47:52,229
Callan is among the injured.

454
00:47:58,695 --> 00:48:00,217
Dad?

455
00:48:06,114 --> 00:48:08,004
I'm fine. It's fine.

456
00:48:10,794 --> 00:48:12,605
You had me worried.

457
00:48:16,372 --> 00:48:18,399
Where's the rest of your troop?

458
00:48:18,424 --> 00:48:20,900
They took most of them alive.

459
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:23,438
We'll get them back.

460
00:48:24,294 --> 00:48:26,376
Don't be in such a hurry.

461
00:48:31,989 --> 00:48:33,886
You're all I have.

462
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:39,273
I know. I'm a soldier.

463
00:48:48,462 --> 00:48:52,839
He would not ask for this meeting if
he thought he could defeat Gul'dan alone.

464
00:48:54,789 --> 00:48:57,993
- The fel must truly terrified him.
- Durotan is scared of nothing.

465
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:00,094
The location.

466
00:49:01,362 --> 00:49:03,986
The suddenness of this meeting.

467
00:49:05,226 --> 00:49:07,168
- Sounds like a trap.
- It is not.

468
00:49:07,193 --> 00:49:08,709
- Could be.
- It is not.

469
00:49:08,734 --> 00:49:10,493
- Could be.
- It is not.

470
00:49:10,518 --> 00:49:12,193
What do you think?

471
00:49:12,556 --> 00:49:14,929
It's too good an
opportunity to ignore.

472
00:49:14,954 --> 00:49:17,403
I think we have no choice.

473
00:49:18,192 --> 00:49:21,325
We must stop the orcs
from opening the portal.

474
00:49:22,163 --> 00:49:24,140
But we will need help.

475
00:49:24,165 --> 00:49:26,342
- And if he's lying?
- Orcs do not lie.

476
00:49:26,367 --> 00:49:28,611
- What if he is?
- There is no honor in it.

477
00:49:28,636 --> 00:49:31,940
And where's the 'honor'
in him betraying his own people?

478
00:49:31,965 --> 00:49:35,795
Durotan is protecting his clan.
His enemy is the fel.

479
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:37,882
Gul'dan is the betrayer.

480
00:49:37,907 --> 00:49:41,757
This orc, Durotan.
How do you know him?

481
00:49:41,782 --> 00:49:45,448
He freed me,
and he is loved by his clan.

482
00:49:45,792 --> 00:49:48,092
He's a strong chieftain.

483
00:49:48,117 --> 00:49:51,335
Strong chiefs must earn
their clans trust.

484
00:49:52,058 --> 00:49:54,672
If we are to expect you
to join us.

485
00:49:55,894 --> 00:49:57,972
We must earn yours.

486
00:50:05,945 --> 00:50:08,052
To defend yourself.

487
00:50:09,648 --> 00:50:11,075
With this?

488
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,696
Yes.

489
00:50:14,332 --> 00:50:16,108
Find the Guardian.

490
00:50:18,843 --> 00:50:20,689
What is this?

491
00:50:21,367 --> 00:50:22,934
Guardian?

492
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:25,908
Uh.

493
00:50:26,792 --> 00:50:29,586
The gate.
We saw it, in the morass.

494
00:50:29,611 --> 00:50:32,214
I've been putting together
all the clues I can about it.

495
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:34,948
This. This drawing.

496
00:50:34,973 --> 00:50:37,230
- Where did you copy it from?
- Guardian.

497
00:50:37,255 --> 00:50:38,860
And this?

498
00:50:41,591 --> 00:50:44,783
And this? And this?

499
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:47,371
I've been researching ever since
I felt the presence of the fel.

500
00:50:47,396 --> 00:50:51,997
I am the Guardian. Me, not you.

501
00:50:52,142 --> 00:50:53,757
Not yet.

502
00:50:53,782 --> 00:50:56,235
I just thought you might
appreciate some help.

503
00:51:05,177 --> 00:51:08,368
Don't presume you can help me.

504
00:51:08,393 --> 00:51:13,905
You have no idea the forces
I contend with.

505
00:51:14,798 --> 00:51:20,316
If you want to help,
protect the king.

506
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:22,975
You leave the fel to me.

507
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:37,810
- Interesting choice.
- Guardian.

508
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:44,033
Pack up and move
to the west gate.

509
00:51:48,579 --> 00:51:49,662
You there.

510
00:51:49,688 --> 00:51:52,174
Pack up your stall
and get moving now!

511
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,765
I need your help.

512
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:02,042
- I found a book.
- Of course you did.

513
00:52:02,067 --> 00:52:03,817
There was an illustration
that showed the gate

514
00:52:03,842 --> 00:52:05,884
like the one we saw being built.

515
00:52:06,486 --> 00:52:08,760
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Khadgar.

516
00:52:10,217 --> 00:52:12,984
Listen. I tried to show the Guardian
but he became furious.

517
00:52:13,009 --> 00:52:14,911
He burned all my research.

518
00:52:14,936 --> 00:52:17,844
He would have burn this too
If I hadn't hidden it in my robe.

519
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:26,951
No, turn the page. Here.

520
00:52:27,549 --> 00:52:28,996
Look.

521
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:30,512
See.

522
00:52:33,759 --> 00:52:35,115
What do you think
the image means?

523
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:37,069
The orcs were summoned.

524
00:52:37,094 --> 00:52:40,025
From this side of the gate.
They were invited in.

525
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:47,251
And the Guardian
burned your research.

526
00:52:49,864 --> 00:52:52,356
He's probably just
trying to protect you.

527
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:55,571
Now go away.

528
00:53:12,738 --> 00:53:15,501
Good spot for an ambush.

529
00:53:17,423 --> 00:53:19,851
Our sentries are well placed.

530
00:53:21,579 --> 00:53:23,536
I will check again.

531
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,778
You asked to speak
with the humanking.

532
00:54:23,803 --> 00:54:25,417
Here he stands.

533
00:54:27,858 --> 00:54:29,627
I am the King Llane.

534
00:54:30,173 --> 00:54:32,636
I'm told you wished to talk.

535
00:54:38,259 --> 00:54:41,328
Ask him if they plan
to return to their home?

536
00:54:50,278 --> 00:54:52,353
Our world is destroyed.

537
00:54:54,135 --> 00:54:55,632
There is nothing to go back to.

538
00:54:55,657 --> 00:54:59,092
We are not responsible
for destroying your world.

539
00:54:59,842 --> 00:55:02,245
War with us will solve nothing.

540
00:55:08,697 --> 00:55:12,385
He says,
"Orcs, war solves everything."

541
00:55:13,307 --> 00:55:15,308
Then why is he here?

542
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:21,901
To save my people.

543
00:55:23,345 --> 00:55:26,841
Fel takes life from
more than it's victims.

544
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:31,335
Kills the earth and
corrupts those who use it.

545
00:55:32,333 --> 00:55:35,850
Gul'dan will poison everything
with his death magic.

546
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:41,581
If my people are to survive,
Gul'dan must be destroyed.

547
00:55:43,855 --> 00:55:48,184
In 2 suns, the humans
we have captured...

548
00:55:49,687 --> 00:55:52,224
be used to fuel the portal.

549
00:55:52,652 --> 00:55:57,281
If you attack our camp,
and draw his warriors away,

550
00:55:58,952 --> 00:56:02,720
Frostwolf clan, will kill him.

551
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,647
Two days.

552
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:14,038
If we do this,
you will protect my people until then.

553
00:56:16,929 --> 00:56:18,809
I will try.

554
00:56:22,735 --> 00:56:24,315
It's a trap!

555
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:26,228
Traitor die!

556
00:56:29,846 --> 00:56:30,915
Retreat!

557
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:33,773
Back! Return to our camp!

558
00:56:34,493 --> 00:56:36,497
Fall back!

559
00:57:04,329 --> 00:57:06,212
Stay together!

560
00:57:10,327 --> 00:57:12,787
Focus. Like old times.

561
00:57:23,351 --> 00:57:25,987
Cover your flank!

562
00:57:32,518 --> 00:57:34,182
Spread out!

563
00:57:36,421 --> 00:57:38,397
Swords!

564
00:57:52,701 --> 00:57:54,270
You alright?

565
00:57:56,726 --> 00:57:59,056
You are no good to us dead. Go.

566
00:57:59,081 --> 00:58:00,828
I'll get the others.

567
00:58:01,701 --> 00:58:02,720
Fall back!

568
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:04,686
We're all getting out.

569
00:58:04,711 --> 00:58:06,961
Medivh will cover our retreat.

570
00:58:06,986 --> 00:58:08,718
Fall back!

571
00:58:19,812 --> 00:58:21,588
Garona!

572
00:58:23,789 --> 00:58:25,616
Stay together!

573
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:30,868
Fall back!

574
00:58:32,289 --> 00:58:34,480
Go on, now!

575
00:58:34,505 --> 00:58:36,800
Where's the bloody Guardian?

576
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:44,867
Protect the king. I got them.

577
00:58:44,892 --> 00:58:47,105
Move back!

578
00:59:01,054 --> 00:59:05,522
Shield FORMATION!

579
00:59:53,762 --> 00:59:55,930
Retreat to the plateau.

580
00:59:56,371 --> 00:59:57,798
Fall back!

581
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:00,736
Up the hill. Move!

582
01:00:19,463 --> 01:00:20,921
Medivh.

583
01:00:24,283 --> 01:00:27,314
Medivh, take it down!

584
01:00:38,979 --> 01:00:40,686
Medivh!

585
01:00:46,416 --> 01:00:48,312
Hold on, son.

586
01:00:50,305 --> 01:00:51,659
Dad.

587
01:00:54,263 --> 01:00:56,040
For Azeroth.

588
01:00:57,008 --> 01:00:58,729
Medivh!

589
01:01:32,597 --> 01:01:34,124
Stop.

590
01:01:35,975 --> 01:01:37,302
No.

591
01:01:40,176 --> 01:01:41,627
Callan.

592
01:02:50,077 --> 01:02:51,529
He's here!

593
01:02:55,532 --> 01:02:56,728
What's wrong with him?

594
01:02:56,753 --> 01:02:58,147
We need to get him to Karazhan.

595
01:02:58,172 --> 01:03:00,776
- I'll get the horses.
- You won't make any time by road.

596
01:03:00,801 --> 01:03:02,646
Take one of my birds.

597
01:03:11,732 --> 01:03:13,632
Place him in the font.

598
01:03:15,657 --> 01:03:19,589
- Moroes, what's wrong with him
- I told him not to leave Karazhan.

599
01:03:34,401 --> 01:03:36,121
I have to go.

600
01:03:36,984 --> 01:03:39,478
We need the help of
the Karin Tor, now.

601
01:03:39,503 --> 01:03:40,469
Go.

602
01:03:40,494 --> 01:03:43,522
There are medicines I must prepare.
Sit with him.

603
01:03:47,484 --> 01:03:50,416
You and the baby must leave now.

604
01:03:52,341 --> 01:03:55,085
You're a traitor, Durotan.

605
01:03:55,764 --> 01:03:57,203
No.

606
01:03:57,228 --> 01:04:00,805
One who values what we once were.
Like you used to.

607
01:04:00,830 --> 01:04:02,771
That time is past.

608
01:04:02,796 --> 01:04:05,585
We are but fuel for the fel now.

609
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:07,747
There is still hope, Blackhand.

610
01:04:07,772 --> 01:04:09,544
Our children.

611
01:04:18,695 --> 01:04:24,011
Do not make me take more
innocent lives, young chieftain.

612
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:29,063
If I submit...

613
01:04:30,467 --> 01:04:32,928
will you let my people be?

614
01:04:42,863 --> 01:04:45,202
What will I call our son?

615
01:04:49,966 --> 01:04:51,585
Go'el

616
01:05:07,817 --> 01:05:09,459
You.

617
01:05:09,557 --> 01:05:11,437
Where's the older man?

618
01:05:11,902 --> 01:05:13,999
He told me to watch you.

619
01:05:15,714 --> 01:05:18,534
- The king.
- He is alive.

620
01:05:21,213 --> 01:05:23,333
Lothar's son is dead.

621
01:05:27,598 --> 01:05:29,849
I argued for the meeting.

622
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:33,870
Lothar will hate me.

623
01:05:33,988 --> 01:05:35,907
This upsets you.

624
01:05:39,024 --> 01:05:41,109
He is a great warrior.

625
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:44,229
He defends his people well.

626
01:05:44,254 --> 01:05:47,271
A good mate for an orc.

627
01:05:47,665 --> 01:05:49,595
I am no orc.

628
01:05:51,663 --> 01:05:53,809
I am no human either.

629
01:05:56,754 --> 01:06:02,052
When I was younger,
I used to feel apart from my kin.

630
01:06:02,077 --> 01:06:09,528
I traveled far and wide,
looking for... wisdom.

631
01:06:09,553 --> 01:06:15,003
Feel a connection with all the souls
I was charged with protecting.

632
01:06:15,328 --> 01:06:20,127
On my travel, I met
a strong and noble people.

633
01:06:20,605 --> 01:06:26,478
Among them, a female,
who accepted me for what I was.

634
01:06:26,503 --> 01:06:28,614
Who loved me.

635
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:34,224
It was not a life
I was fated to have,

636
01:06:34,249 --> 01:06:36,393
but it taught me something.

637
01:06:36,957 --> 01:06:39,504
If love is what you need,

638
01:06:40,687 --> 01:06:44,533
you must be willing to travel
to the end the world to find it.

639
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:52,091
You left your mate.

640
01:06:52,116 --> 01:06:54,033
Go find Lothar.

641
01:07:15,515 --> 01:07:17,767
Step inside the circle.

642
01:07:26,774 --> 01:07:32,836
This... is my gift to you,
Garona.

643
01:08:02,779 --> 01:08:05,922
A whole world and
exchange for a statue.

644
01:08:06,575 --> 01:08:09,283
Gods are strange creatures.

645
01:08:11,719 --> 01:08:16,899
Frostwolves, you are a practical people.

646
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:21,158
Those of us from the south have
always admired that about you.

647
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:32,356
When the portal opens,
when the rest of the Horde join us

648
01:08:32,388 --> 01:08:35,201
we will give them the fel.

649
01:08:35,517 --> 01:08:38,355
- All of them.
- Durotan did not agree to this!

650
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:42,001
And why would you care
what that traitor thinks?

651
01:08:42,418 --> 01:08:46,017
It is time for a new leader
of the Frostwolf clan.

652
01:08:46,042 --> 01:08:49,446
One who has the best interest
of his orcs in mind.

653
01:08:49,478 --> 01:08:53,119
One who appreciates Gul'dan's vision,

654
01:08:55,719 --> 01:08:57,606
his power.

655
01:08:58,588 --> 01:09:00,093
Come.

656
01:09:00,884 --> 01:09:03,515
I will grant you the fel.

657
01:09:04,853 --> 01:09:10,440
Durotan, he... has poisoned
the Frostwolves against the fel.

658
01:09:10,667 --> 01:09:14,784
Let me gather them,
bring them here.

659
01:09:15,419 --> 01:09:18,372
Grant me the fel in front of them,
let them see...

660
01:09:18,397 --> 01:09:21,219
How much stronger I become.

661
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:26,755
As I said, a practical people.

662
01:09:27,915 --> 01:09:30,220
This is a new dawn.

663
01:09:30,245 --> 01:09:33,048
The time of the Horde.

664
01:09:33,556 --> 01:09:38,566
Be feared, or be fuel.

665
01:09:51,226 --> 01:09:52,989
I'm sorry.

666
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:57,238
Callan's mother,

667
01:09:58,764 --> 01:10:01,081
died in childbirth.

668
01:10:04,832 --> 01:10:08,549
I blamed him for it, for years.

669
01:10:09,209 --> 01:10:11,396
I'm not going to blame you.

670
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:23,083
He was so young.

671
01:10:34,744 --> 01:10:36,955
In my entire life,

672
01:10:39,541 --> 01:10:43,855
I have never felt
so much pain as I do now.

673
01:10:59,946 --> 01:11:03,311
Gul'dan does not want to waste
his power on the Frostwolves.

674
01:11:03,336 --> 01:11:05,226
Burn them!

675
01:11:10,513 --> 01:11:13,627
Take the weak, kill the strong!

676
01:11:29,848 --> 01:11:32,421
I'll bathe in your blood.

677
01:11:32,446 --> 01:11:34,877
Maybe, but not now.

678
01:11:34,902 --> 01:11:39,216
I can't give you long,
but I can give you a head start.

679
01:11:40,876 --> 01:11:43,617
For the sake of your son, Draka.

680
01:11:43,642 --> 01:11:47,002
Leave... now.

681
01:12:01,364 --> 01:12:06,229
You should have trusted in your
chieftain, Orgrim Doomhammer.

682
01:12:44,054 --> 01:12:45,643
Wait for me.

683
01:12:46,196 --> 01:12:49,077
- Khadgar!
- How dare you to come here!

684
01:12:49,102 --> 01:12:50,009
Get out!

685
01:12:50,034 --> 01:12:51,551
I come seeking your wisdom.

686
01:12:51,576 --> 01:12:53,409
There is nothing
for you here now.

687
01:12:53,434 --> 01:12:55,842
The Guardian, Medivh, is unwell.

688
01:12:55,867 --> 01:12:56,918
What?

689
01:12:56,943 --> 01:12:58,985
- He's been poisoned by the fel.
- What?

690
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:01,072
Ridiculous.

691
01:13:01,097 --> 01:13:02,894
What do you know
of the dark portal?

692
01:13:02,919 --> 01:13:05,788
You come back,
and accused the Guardian...

693
01:13:05,813 --> 01:13:07,487
What is Alodi?

694
01:13:07,512 --> 01:13:09,426
How does he know?

695
01:13:16,377 --> 01:13:18,024
Alodi.

696
01:13:18,522 --> 01:13:19,996
What is it?

697
01:13:20,202 --> 01:13:24,207
An entity from a time
before the Kirin Tor existed.

698
01:13:24,444 --> 01:13:28,045
We think it serve the functions
similar to that of the Guardian.

699
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:29,674
Protector.

700
01:13:30,333 --> 01:13:35,436
No one beyond the arch council knows of
it's existence, and it will stay that way.

701
01:13:35,806 --> 01:13:37,788
And you to mention it
in the same breath

702
01:13:37,813 --> 01:13:40,826
as the dark portal is
too much to be mere...

703
01:13:44,044 --> 01:13:45,867
coincidence.

704
01:13:47,746 --> 01:13:49,326
Do I go in?

705
01:13:49,351 --> 01:13:52,318
I don't know.
It's never done that before.

706
01:14:10,735 --> 01:14:12,236
Khadgar.

707
01:14:12,261 --> 01:14:15,607
I know you, from the library.

708
01:14:17,314 --> 01:14:19,078
You're Alodi?

709
01:14:22,474 --> 01:14:27,860
I used the last of my energies
to summon you here.

710
01:14:27,885 --> 01:14:31,967
- The Guardian has betrayed us.
- Medivh.

711
01:14:33,138 --> 01:14:37,043
- I saw the fel in his eyes.
- He is consumed by it.

712
01:14:37,068 --> 01:14:41,492
If he is not stopped,
this world will burn.

713
01:14:41,517 --> 01:14:44,046
I don't have the power
to defeat a Guardian.

714
01:14:45,025 --> 01:14:47,537
Guardian is but a name.

715
01:14:47,739 --> 01:14:52,542
The true Guardians of this world
are the people themselves.

716
01:14:52,567 --> 01:14:56,144
I know you see what
the Kirin Tor can not.

717
01:14:56,169 --> 01:14:58,167
It's why you left them.

718
01:14:58,192 --> 01:15:05,432
No one can stand against
the darkness... alone.

719
01:15:05,812 --> 01:15:08,556
I don't understand what
you want me to do.

720
01:15:11,937 --> 01:15:14,080
Yes, you do.

721
01:15:17,324 --> 01:15:19,747
Trust in your friends.

722
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:23,339
Together, you can save this world.

723
01:15:23,364 --> 01:15:26,221
Always remember.

724
01:15:26,246 --> 01:15:28,831
From light comes darkness,

725
01:15:28,856 --> 01:15:33,643
and from darkness... light.

726
01:15:44,098 --> 01:15:45,611
Up, up.

727
01:15:52,266 --> 01:15:55,144
Thank you, Moroes.

728
01:15:55,715 --> 01:15:57,776
You'll recover, Guardian.

729
01:15:57,801 --> 01:15:59,470
You always do.

730
01:16:00,226 --> 01:16:04,507
No... Thank you.

731
01:16:04,947 --> 01:16:07,177
For everything you've done.

732
01:16:23,289 --> 01:16:25,362
Sorry, old friend.

733
01:16:26,828 --> 01:16:31,832
It seems I have let
the orcs into this world.

734
01:16:31,992 --> 01:16:35,884
The fel has twisted me. I...

735
01:16:35,916 --> 01:16:39,147
don't even know
what else I may have done.

736
01:16:40,211 --> 01:16:43,913
I just don't remember.

737
01:16:48,451 --> 01:16:54,258
Everything I fought to protect,
I have... destroyed.

738
01:16:55,084 --> 01:16:57,529
I can't control the fel.

739
01:17:01,164 --> 01:17:03,097
No one can.

740
01:17:14,517 --> 01:17:17,177
Five legions to block Deadwind Pass.

741
01:17:17,202 --> 01:17:22,040
Another ten here, here, and here,
along Redridge Mountains.

742
01:17:22,065 --> 01:17:23,428
Supply lines here.

743
01:17:23,453 --> 01:17:26,893
While the Eastern Sea hems
them in both south and east.

744
01:17:27,805 --> 01:17:31,946
If we hold these positions,
we will be at our strongest.

745
01:17:32,544 --> 01:17:33,680
Containment?

746
01:17:33,705 --> 01:17:35,304
Until there is a better option, yes.

747
01:17:35,349 --> 01:17:38,003
And where there is
10 times as many.

748
01:17:38,028 --> 01:17:39,529
What then?

749
01:17:41,233 --> 01:17:42,544
If there were easy answers...

750
01:17:42,569 --> 01:17:45,856
Our priority must be
to stop the gate from opening.

751
01:17:46,195 --> 01:17:48,250
Fail there, and it's
just a matter of time

752
01:17:48,275 --> 01:17:49,899
before they beat us
with sheer numbers.

753
01:17:49,924 --> 01:17:51,804
What do you suggest?

754
01:17:52,575 --> 01:17:54,858
Send everything we got.

755
01:17:55,704 --> 01:17:59,020
Destroy the gate, free our people,
and end the immediate threat.

756
01:17:59,045 --> 01:18:01,778
- And the Orcs that remain?
- We'll take care of them later.

757
01:18:01,803 --> 01:18:04,306
After they've ravaged the entire kingdom?

758
01:18:04,521 --> 01:18:07,324
- My Lords.
- Medivh. You are up and well.

759
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:12,365
I am. I feel... restored.

760
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:15,324
We need you.
We've been agonizing over our options.

761
01:18:15,349 --> 01:18:17,363
Some of us believe
there are no options.

762
01:18:17,388 --> 01:18:20,117
- We need fresh eyes.
- I have news.

763
01:18:20,142 --> 01:18:23,263
- I've met with Durotan.
- You met with Durotan.

764
01:18:23,288 --> 01:18:27,447
The rebellion against Gul'dan
is gaining strength.

765
01:18:27,472 --> 01:18:29,670
With their help we can
destroy this gate.

766
01:18:29,695 --> 01:18:32,500
- That doesn't change my plan.
- What plan?

767
01:18:32,525 --> 01:18:35,446
Anduin believes we should
attack with full force.

768
01:18:35,471 --> 01:18:37,990
I'm concerned it leaves the rest
of the kingdom defenseless.

769
01:18:38,015 --> 01:18:41,875
How many legions would you need
to hold the orcs in place?

770
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:45,294
Five for Deadwind Pass.
Ten for the Redridge Mountains.

771
01:18:45,319 --> 01:18:46,454
Ten more to protect the city.

772
01:18:46,479 --> 01:18:48,981
We've already lost 18 legions.

773
01:18:49,006 --> 01:18:52,617
- That leaves one, two, three.
- Can it be done, Medivh?

774
01:18:52,642 --> 01:18:55,232
No, it can't be done.

775
01:18:56,281 --> 01:18:58,575
With three legion,
Frostwolves, and my power...

776
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,208
With all due respect, Guardian,
your powers

777
01:19:00,233 --> 01:19:03,538
have proven unreliable
at best recently.

778
01:19:03,782 --> 01:19:05,767
- Llane. Have I ever let you down?
- Let him down?

779
01:19:05,792 --> 01:19:08,610
Where have you even been
for the last 6 years?

780
01:19:09,628 --> 01:19:11,387
Please, Anduin.
Medivh is the Guardian...

781
01:19:11,412 --> 01:19:13,665
Not the one you remember.

782
01:19:14,151 --> 01:19:16,501
He's lost it. He's unstable.

783
01:19:16,526 --> 01:19:19,068
And he won't be there
when you really need him.

784
01:19:19,093 --> 01:19:21,171
Find your bearings, Anduin.

785
01:19:21,195 --> 01:19:23,313
I'd march into hell for you,

786
01:19:23,339 --> 01:19:25,953
if I thought there was a
slightest chance of victory.

787
01:19:25,978 --> 01:19:28,395
But there isn't,
this is suicide.

788
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:30,425
Is this about Callan?

789
01:19:31,176 --> 01:19:32,798
It was a tragedy.

790
01:19:32,823 --> 01:19:35,648
If he hadn't been trying so hard
to win your approval,

791
01:19:35,673 --> 01:19:38,394
- he might still be with us.
- Medivh.

792
01:19:38,419 --> 01:19:40,539
Callan wasn't ready.
You knew it.

793
01:19:40,563 --> 01:19:43,501
- And you let him play soldier anyway.
- Anduin, stop!

794
01:19:43,526 --> 01:19:45,229
You killed him!

795
01:19:46,149 --> 01:19:48,440
Commander. Please, sir. Please.

796
01:19:48,465 --> 01:19:51,919
Varis.
Take him to a cell to calm down.

797
01:19:53,005 --> 01:19:55,317
You are no use to us like this.

798
01:20:07,106 --> 01:20:09,775
We'll protect the kingdom, my lord.

799
01:20:10,001 --> 01:20:11,745
You and I.

800
01:20:24,654 --> 01:20:26,227
Why are you here?

801
01:20:26,252 --> 01:20:27,896
The king.

802
01:20:28,777 --> 01:20:31,025
He goes to fight the Horde.

803
01:20:32,778 --> 01:20:36,321
With your Guardian's help,
Durotan will kill Gul'dan.

804
01:20:36,346 --> 01:20:37,514
Don't trust him.

805
01:20:37,539 --> 01:20:39,513
I've told you, Orcs do not lie.

806
01:20:39,538 --> 01:20:41,308
Not Durotan.

807
01:20:44,516 --> 01:20:46,453
Don't trust Medivh.

808
01:20:50,996 --> 01:20:53,376
I will try to protect your king.

809
01:20:53,797 --> 01:20:55,688
Don't go with them.

810
01:20:55,713 --> 01:20:57,078
Why?

811
01:20:59,718 --> 01:21:01,620
I don't want you to get hurt.

812
01:21:15,534 --> 01:21:17,532
Come back alive.

813
01:21:40,012 --> 01:21:42,021
Hey, Frostwolf.

814
01:21:42,046 --> 01:21:43,552
Who goes...

815
01:21:45,118 --> 01:21:47,353
Now you are enemies
with all sides.

816
01:21:47,378 --> 01:21:49,508
I'll tell them it was you.

817
01:22:03,489 --> 01:22:05,284
What happened?

818
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:09,526
I'm sorry, Durotan.

819
01:22:10,459 --> 01:22:13,547
I did not see how we could
side with the humans...

820
01:22:13,572 --> 01:22:15,976
against our own kind.

821
01:22:16,835 --> 01:22:18,749
I was wrong.

822
01:22:18,944 --> 01:22:22,239
Gul'dan's fel magic is destroying us.

823
01:22:30,783 --> 01:22:33,075
Where's Draka? Safe?

824
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:35,255
But, the rest...

825
01:22:37,171 --> 01:22:39,248
They won't follow him,

826
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:41,765
if they could see
what he has become.

827
01:22:43,727 --> 01:22:45,905
And I will show them.

828
01:23:12,682 --> 01:23:16,905
There is no other man I would entrust
the safety of my family to, Varian.

829
01:23:17,202 --> 01:23:20,394
Keep them safe while I'm gone.

830
01:23:33,368 --> 01:23:34,802
Ready?

831
01:23:35,530 --> 01:23:38,425
I would feel better if
Lothar were riding with us.

832
01:23:38,450 --> 01:23:40,317
We'll be fine.

833
01:23:40,342 --> 01:23:43,361
I'll return to Karazhan
and get ready for battle.

834
01:23:44,265 --> 01:23:46,203
Find me at the portal.

835
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:01,029
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa, whoa!

836
01:24:08,249 --> 01:24:09,653
Guard.

837
01:24:09,911 --> 01:24:13,994
I know you're just doing your job,
and a good one at that.

838
01:24:15,235 --> 01:24:17,441
But I've cool down now.

839
01:24:17,466 --> 01:24:20,610
So, if you just come
and open this gate.

840
01:24:20,635 --> 01:24:22,897
So I can protect the king.

841
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:26,695
OPEN THE GATE!

842
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:28,787
I am just following my...

843
01:24:35,797 --> 01:24:38,253
- Where the hell have you been?
- The Kirin Tor.

844
01:24:38,993 --> 01:24:42,090
It only works on the simple minded,
last about a minute.

845
01:24:42,656 --> 01:24:44,492
Your armor, commander.

846
01:24:45,258 --> 01:24:46,718
Sorry.

847
01:24:50,745 --> 01:24:52,827
They have a full day
ahead of us.

848
01:24:53,414 --> 01:24:55,985
- I just hope we're not too late.
- We can't go after them.

849
01:24:56,010 --> 01:24:57,339
Not if you want to save Azeroth.

850
01:24:57,364 --> 01:25:00,259
- My king needs me.
- AZEROTH needs you more!

851
01:25:00,548 --> 01:25:04,463
If you want to save your king,
we need to stop Medivh first.

852
01:25:14,369 --> 01:25:16,163
Where is Medivh?

853
01:25:16,939 --> 01:25:19,065
We got a demon to kill.

854
01:25:24,330 --> 01:25:26,737
Go. Search over here.

855
01:25:44,948 --> 01:25:46,530
Remember.

856
01:25:46,555 --> 01:25:48,817
You are the son of
Durotan and Draka,

857
01:25:48,842 --> 01:25:51,474
an unbroken line of chieftains.

858
01:26:39,842 --> 01:26:44,148
I am Durotan, son of Garad.

859
01:26:44,954 --> 01:26:47,579
Chieftain of the Frostwolf clan.

860
01:26:47,604 --> 01:26:51,766
And I am here to kill Gul'dan.

861
01:26:52,607 --> 01:26:56,252
Ghost cannot invoke Mak'gora.
(Duel of honor)

862
01:26:56,277 --> 01:26:58,970
You are the chieftain
of no clan.

863
01:26:58,995 --> 01:27:02,004
Your people are food for worms.

864
01:27:02,626 --> 01:27:05,868
Some of us still live, warchief.

865
01:27:09,546 --> 01:27:12,008
Do I make a quick end of them?

866
01:27:12,256 --> 01:27:15,877
I always thought you were
one for tradition, Blackhand.

867
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:19,897
Durotan.

868
01:27:21,198 --> 01:27:25,637
Your clan was weak,
and you are a traitor.

869
01:27:26,494 --> 01:27:29,463
I accept your challenge,
if only to personally

870
01:27:29,488 --> 01:27:32,661
ripped the heart out
of your pathetic body.

871
01:27:32,686 --> 01:27:34,015
What of the portal?

872
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:37,207
You must be ready when
the incantation begins

873
01:27:37,509 --> 01:27:39,880
This won't take long.

874
01:29:04,219 --> 01:29:06,368
Crush him, Gul'dan!

875
01:29:16,230 --> 01:29:18,918
It's the incantation
to the Orc home world.

876
01:29:21,246 --> 01:29:23,944
He's opening the portal,
we need to shut him up.

877
01:29:27,467 --> 01:29:29,498
The incantation.

878
01:29:29,847 --> 01:29:33,537
I have no time for this.
Blackhand!

879
01:29:35,299 --> 01:29:37,811
(... Orc tradition...)

880
01:29:39,064 --> 01:29:41,526
This is a Mak'gora.
(Duel of honor)

881
01:29:43,101 --> 01:29:45,790
You will respect our tradition.

882
01:29:46,125 --> 01:29:48,130
Keep fighting.

883
01:29:54,747 --> 01:29:56,880
Gul'dan cheats.

884
01:30:05,579 --> 01:30:07,249
- Cheating!
- Shame on you!

885
01:30:07,274 --> 01:30:09,361
You cheat, Gul'dan!

886
01:30:09,386 --> 01:30:11,236
This is not our way.

887
01:30:11,261 --> 01:30:13,345
Traitor!

888
01:30:28,674 --> 01:30:30,598
GUL'DAN!

889
01:30:32,686 --> 01:30:35,703
You have no honor.

890
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:24,229
You will follow this... thing?

891
01:31:29,276 --> 01:31:30,742
Do you?

892
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:36,611
You will follow this demon?

893
01:31:38,004 --> 01:31:39,875
I will not.

894
01:31:41,780 --> 01:31:44,894
I follow a true Orc.

895
01:31:46,141 --> 01:31:47,987
A chieftain.

896
01:31:53,766 --> 01:31:56,914
May your balls rot, demon.

897
01:32:01,691 --> 01:32:03,697
Anyone else?

898
01:32:07,278 --> 01:32:09,859
And you, warchief.

899
01:32:09,883 --> 01:32:11,355
You will take the fel,

900
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:14,888
and you will become stronger
than any Orc has ever been.

901
01:32:14,914 --> 01:32:20,414
And when the fel has remade you,
you will crush the smallteeth.

902
01:32:22,990 --> 01:32:26,211
Now claim my new world.

903
01:32:33,862 --> 01:32:35,705
Legion! Halt!

904
01:32:35,730 --> 01:32:37,531
Frostwolves.

905
01:32:39,613 --> 01:32:41,923
We are on our own now.

906
01:32:41,948 --> 01:32:43,796
With you then.

907
01:32:53,352 --> 01:32:55,277
Get to the prisoners.

908
01:32:55,419 --> 01:32:57,788
We will free our people!

909
01:32:58,605 --> 01:33:00,330
Charge!

910
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:11,148
Attack!

911
01:33:13,142 --> 01:33:14,870
Ideas?

912
01:33:20,129 --> 01:33:24,573
Very impressive.
Now try shutting him up.

913
01:33:26,722 --> 01:33:28,575
Oh, that went well.

914
01:33:28,949 --> 01:33:31,311
Ohhhhh.

915
01:33:31,907 --> 01:33:34,879
- He's moving, do something.
- (What?)

916
01:33:34,904 --> 01:33:37,649
Fine, I'll handle this.

917
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:40,304
You take care of Medivh.

918
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:50,445
Hey, over here. Clayface.

919
01:34:09,799 --> 01:34:11,662
Now, men!

920
01:34:12,189 --> 01:34:13,875
Fire!

921
01:35:01,431 --> 01:35:03,391
Come, my orcs.

922
01:35:03,416 --> 01:35:08,225
Let the fel unleash the
full power of the Horde.

923
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:18,870
- For Gul'dan!
- For the Horde!

924
01:36:05,674 --> 01:36:08,532
Hey, kid! Wake up!

925
01:36:10,799 --> 01:36:12,468
You alright?

926
01:36:14,782 --> 01:36:16,299
Quick thinking.

927
01:36:16,324 --> 01:36:18,689
- Slicing it's head off like that.
- Yeah.

928
01:36:18,714 --> 01:36:20,531
Just how I planned it.

929
01:36:21,964 --> 01:36:23,152
What now?

930
01:36:23,177 --> 01:36:26,163
The Guardian has to speak
the incantation himself.

931
01:36:26,188 --> 01:36:28,545
So uh...
As long as he is doing that...

932
01:36:28,574 --> 01:36:31,929
we can get in close.
Distract him.

933
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:33,894
Then what?

934
01:36:34,578 --> 01:36:36,658
Get Medivh in the font.

935
01:36:37,019 --> 01:36:38,824
Is that all?

936
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:52,678
Medivh.

937
01:36:53,194 --> 01:36:56,550
If there is something of you
still in there, old friend,

938
01:36:58,049 --> 01:36:59,843
come back to us.

939
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:21,557
Medivh.

940
01:37:32,689 --> 01:37:34,030
Come.

941
01:37:34,798 --> 01:37:36,343
Kill me.

942
01:37:37,870 --> 01:37:41,241
I have got nothing left
to live for now anyway.

943
01:37:44,678 --> 01:37:47,950
After all, life is just
fuel to you, isn't it?

944
01:37:48,869 --> 01:37:51,952
But Llane, he believed in you.

945
01:37:53,094 --> 01:37:54,944
Don't kill your king.

946
01:37:56,639 --> 01:37:58,605
Don't kill your friend.

947
01:38:06,315 --> 01:38:08,612
Whatever you plan to do, kid.

948
01:38:09,099 --> 01:38:10,681
Do it now.

949
01:38:16,287 --> 01:38:17,661
Now.

950
01:38:19,151 --> 01:38:21,118
Now! Now!

951
01:38:21,143 --> 01:38:23,035
Now, kid!

952
01:38:30,537 --> 01:38:32,748
The portal. It's closing!

953
01:38:32,773 --> 01:38:34,251
No.

954
01:39:06,289 --> 01:39:08,523
You're stronger than he is.

955
01:39:25,583 --> 01:39:28,396
From light comes darkness...

956
01:39:29,294 --> 01:39:33,079
and from darkness... light.

957
01:39:50,252 --> 01:39:52,222
Show me your eyes.

958
01:40:00,795 --> 01:40:02,475
I have to go.

959
01:40:08,926 --> 01:40:10,750
I'm proud of you.

960
01:40:37,707 --> 01:40:39,426
Stormwind.

961
01:40:40,423 --> 01:40:44,002
My lord.
Through the portal, Stormwind!

962
01:40:44,027 --> 01:40:45,907
Thank you, Guardian.

963
01:40:46,003 --> 01:40:47,134
Varis!

964
01:40:47,159 --> 01:40:49,799
Legion, forward!

965
01:40:50,512 --> 01:40:52,177
Attack!

966
01:40:52,673 --> 01:40:55,085
Garona, ride with me.

967
01:41:20,106 --> 01:41:22,340
Varis, set the men
in a perimeter.

968
01:41:22,365 --> 01:41:25,920
Garona, Karos, take what men
we can spare and free the prisoners.

969
01:41:25,944 --> 01:41:27,854
And send them through to Stormwind.

970
01:41:27,879 --> 01:41:29,675
Form a line, shield to shield!

971
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:32,228
We will hold as long as we can.

972
01:41:33,509 --> 01:41:35,319
Get to the portal.

973
01:41:36,478 --> 01:41:38,896
- Go.
- Bless you.

974
01:41:39,096 --> 01:41:40,597
Thank you.

975
01:41:56,563 --> 01:41:58,507
I need more powder.

976
01:42:00,139 --> 01:42:03,721
Get over there! Help me push!

977
01:42:04,732 --> 01:42:09,167
Come on, boys!
Put your scorn into it!

978
01:42:16,619 --> 01:42:20,923
Go around!
We'll attack them behind the portal!

979
01:42:30,576 --> 01:42:32,543
Take care of him.

980
01:42:38,479 --> 01:42:39,988
We should leave.

981
01:42:40,013 --> 01:42:43,010
We save as many of
our people as we can.

982
01:42:47,067 --> 01:42:51,877
It's the loneliness
that makes us weak.

983
01:42:52,678 --> 01:42:54,305
Khadgar.

984
01:42:56,964 --> 01:42:58,667
I'm sorry.

985
01:43:00,263 --> 01:43:02,716
I wanted to save us all.

986
01:43:05,768 --> 01:43:07,769
I always did.

987
01:43:18,684 --> 01:43:19,933
Move!

988
01:43:27,078 --> 01:43:29,080
We've lost the Guardian.

989
01:43:37,189 --> 01:43:41,020
Protect the flank!
Protect the flank!

990
01:44:12,157 --> 01:44:15,525
Blackhand comes to claim
the honor of killing you.

991
01:44:20,672 --> 01:44:22,253
Garona.

992
01:44:23,575 --> 01:44:26,247
No good will come
from us both died.

993
01:44:27,055 --> 01:44:30,728
Look around you,
we are surrounded.

994
01:44:32,276 --> 01:44:35,871
Your killing me is the only
hope we have for peace.

995
01:44:36,488 --> 01:44:40,672
You told Lady Taria that killing her
would bring you honor.

996
01:44:40,697 --> 01:44:43,644
Well. Killing me
would make you a hero.

997
01:44:46,986 --> 01:44:48,624
Survive.

998
01:44:49,361 --> 01:44:52,710
Bring peace between
orcs and humans.

999
01:44:55,099 --> 01:44:56,994
You must.

1000
01:45:15,142 --> 01:45:16,953
You must.

1001
01:45:42,833 --> 01:45:44,751
No. No!

1002
01:46:02,257 --> 01:46:05,370
She has killed their chieftain,
Gul'dan.

1003
01:46:05,968 --> 01:46:08,912
The Horde embraces you.

1004
01:46:10,846 --> 01:46:12,539
Orc.

1005
01:47:49,956 --> 01:47:52,242
Mak'gora. (Duel of honor)

1006
01:49:06,091 --> 01:49:07,976
For my son.

1007
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:17,518
Kill him.

1008
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:24,628
Kill him!

1009
01:49:28,565 --> 01:49:32,351
Gul'dan, the Mak'gora is sacred.

1010
01:49:32,701 --> 01:49:35,730
The human won, fairly.

1011
01:49:36,498 --> 01:49:38,670
Let your warriors honor their tradition.

1012
01:49:38,695 --> 01:49:41,666
I will not be disobeyed.

1013
01:49:42,218 --> 01:49:44,902
What are you waiting for?

1014
01:49:50,214 --> 01:49:52,361
Do as I say!

1015
01:49:53,968 --> 01:49:55,760
Traitors!

1016
01:49:59,086 --> 01:50:02,280
Get out of my way,
I'll do it myself.

1017
01:50:02,305 --> 01:50:03,557
Who will obey you?

1018
01:50:03,582 --> 01:50:05,880
If you go to war
with your own kind.

1019
01:50:06,303 --> 01:50:09,719
If you do this,
you will lose the Horde.

1020
01:50:09,959 --> 01:50:12,217
And this war is only beginning.

1021
01:50:52,278 --> 01:50:54,258
For your son.

1022
01:50:58,160 --> 01:51:01,073
So your spirit can teach him.

1023
01:51:32,209 --> 01:51:33,963
Garona's dagger.

1024
01:51:35,067 --> 01:51:37,396
I pulled that from Llane's neck.

1025
01:51:37,421 --> 01:51:39,693
Well.
There has to be an explanation.

1026
01:51:39,718 --> 01:51:43,475
Yes. She made her choice.

1027
01:51:44,438 --> 01:51:46,193
I don't believe that.

1028
01:51:48,974 --> 01:51:52,469
Maybe you and I didn't know her
as well as we thought we did.

1029
01:51:56,083 --> 01:52:00,629
There is no greater blessing
a city can have

1030
01:52:00,654 --> 01:52:07,432
than a king who would
sacrifice himself for his people.

1031
01:52:09,552 --> 01:52:12,875
But such a sacrifice must be earned.

1032
01:52:12,900 --> 01:52:15,002
We must deserve it.

1033
01:52:15,316 --> 01:52:20,209
If we only show our unity
to mourn a good man's death.

1034
01:52:20,254 --> 01:52:22,850
Was King Llane wrong
to believe in you?

1035
01:52:22,875 --> 01:52:25,554
- No!
- No!

1036
01:52:25,608 --> 01:52:28,157
We will avenge you, my lady!

1037
01:52:28,826 --> 01:52:32,001
Lead us against the orcs, Lothar!

1038
01:52:32,950 --> 01:52:37,514
- Lothar!
- Lothar!

1039
01:52:37,539 --> 01:52:41,239
- Lothar!
- Lothar!

1040
01:52:41,264 --> 01:52:45,123
- Lothar!
- Lothar!

1041
01:52:49,147 --> 01:52:53,128
For Azeroth!
For Azeroth and the Alliance!

1042
01:52:53,153 --> 01:52:55,659
- For Azeroth!
- For Azeroth!

1043
01:52:55,684 --> 01:52:58,402
- For the Alliance!
- For the Alliance!

1044
01:53:21,712 --> 01:53:24,861
You will travel far, my little Go'el.

1045
01:53:29,994 --> 01:53:34,128
My world maybe lost,
but this is your world now.

1046
01:53:34,853 --> 01:53:37,046
Take what you need from it.

1047
01:53:37,071 --> 01:53:41,458
Make a home for the orcs
and let no one stand in your way.

1048
01:53:43,968 --> 01:53:46,949
My lord. You should see this.

1049
01:53:47,498 --> 01:53:51,008
You are the son of
Durotan and Draka,

1050
01:53:51,033 --> 01:53:53,521
an unbroken line of chieftains.

1051
01:53:53,546 --> 01:53:55,606
And our people need
a leader now...

1052
01:53:55,631 --> 01:53:57,472
more than ever.
