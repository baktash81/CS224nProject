<i>We knew this would happen,

would catch up with us.</i>

<i>Eight years

knows what to do</i>

10
00:01:28,987 --> 00:01:30,757

the price of water.</i>

11
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:33,693

14
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:42,835
<i>And I think about Ruth.</i>

15
00:01:44,002 --> 00:01:46,406
<i>I always think about Ruth.</i>

16
00:01:47,138 --> 00:01:50,709
<i>How did she survive out there
on her own as broken as she is?</i>

17
00:01:52,043 --> 00:01:53,645
I wish she'd never left.

18
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,449
I wish I could have helped her,
fixed her.

19
00:01:57,648 --> 00:01:59,584
But I can't let myself
think that.

20
00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:01,620
I know better than anyone.

21
00:02:02,954 --> 00:02:04,056
If something's broken...

22
00:02:05,556 --> 00:02:06,659

Half.

35
00:03:53,865 --> 00:03:55,601

What's the name of this town?

36
00:03:56,034 --> 00:03:56,969

Right.

- I understand.

45
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:25,764
What did I tell you?

46
00:04:26,697 --> 00:04:28,900
- Angela will... wait.
- Wait.

47
00:04:40,646 --> 00:04:41,547
It's...

48
00:04:42,214 --> 00:04:43,149

- <i>What are you talking about?</i>
- Stay away from the windows.

56
00:07:11,762 --> 00:07:12,697
And cover her head.

00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:56,342
It's okay.

66
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:07,386
She said this room
called the office?

67
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:08,821
Yeah.

68
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:12,091
- Just one woman?
- That's what the owner said.

69
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,694

Wow, this stuff is terrible,
huh?

84
00:09:49,286 --> 00:09:50,855
I don't even remember
what a, uh,

85
00:09:51,055 --> 00:09:52,358
proper cup of coffee
tastes like.

00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:55,194
- If...
- [indistinct chatter]

00:09:58,195 --> 00:09:59,864
Uh, miss, can I...

88
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,199
- What? Oh, no.
- Oh, come on.

89
00:10:04,201 --> 00:10:05,837
Uh, I couldn't.

90
00:10:06,403 --> 00:10:07,472
I'm on a business trip.

91
00:10:08,105 --> 00:10:09,207
Not like I'm paying for it.

92
00:10:10,075 --> 00:10:10,975
Here you go, honey.

93
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:14,313
Thank you.

94
00:10:17,081 --> 00:10:18,450
- Thank you.
- Oh, all right.

95
00:10:34,932 --> 00:10:37,001
I shouldn't have complained
about it.

96
00:10:37,902 --> 00:10:38,603
Uh...

97
00:10:39,503 --> 00:10:41,940
No, you're right,
it's terrible but...

98
00:10:43,108 --> 00:10:44,609
- so good.
- Mm-hmm.

99
00:10:47,978 --> 00:10:49,013
Where you headed?

100
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:53,618
Oh, uh, I'm just going.

101
00:10:55,185 --> 00:10:56,254
What does, uh...

102
00:10:56,988 --> 00:10:57,722
what does that mean?

103
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:02,995
- Figuring some things out.
- Hmm.

104
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,495
I remember those days.

105
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,432
I'm married.

106
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:08,563
Nine years, two kids.

107
00:11:08,565 --> 00:11:12,204
[inhales] So, my things
are pretty much figured.

108
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:15,608
Oh, speaking of which,
I should...

109
00:11:16,273 --> 00:11:17,942
I should probably
get going here.

110
00:11:19,109 --> 00:11:20,012
Well...

111
00:11:21,146 --> 00:11:22,348
it was nice talking to you.

112
00:11:23,647 --> 00:11:25,216
Take care, and, uh...

113
00:11:26,084 --> 00:11:26,986
and good luck.

114
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:30,455
- Thanks.
- Oh, I'm... I'm Bill.

115
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,292
Thanks, Bill.

116
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,195

[Bill] Honey?

121
00:12:17,334 --> 00:12:18,237
I'm over here.

122
00:12:26,511 --> 00:12:27,512
[Bill] <i>What did you do?</i>

123
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:29,981
If you don't mind me asking.

124
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:32,116
Really, you can just...

125
00:12:32,617 --> 00:12:35,187
- pull over here and I'll...
- Look, um...

126
00:12:35,753 --> 00:12:37,656
my life is pretty...

127
00:12:38,522 --> 00:12:39,457
boring.

128
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,328
Let me help you, all right?

129
00:12:43,627 --> 00:12:45,030
Let me make my wife proud.

130
00:12:52,203 --> 00:12:54,673
There should be a town...

131
00:12:55,507 --> 00:12:57,575
about 20 miles from here.

132
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:02,245
If you drop me there,
you can tell your wife

133
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:03,649
you saved someone's life today.

134
00:13:04,748 --> 00:13:07,286
- That's it?
- That's it.

135
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:09,654
Okay.

136
00:13:15,627 --> 00:13:17,128
It's just crazy, right,
I mean...

137
00:13:17,594 --> 00:13:19,731
here we are
in the middle of nowhere

138
00:13:20,131 --> 00:13:22,731
and a cop shows up
and heads right for your car

139
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:24,136
just as you're walking out.

140
00:13:25,203 --> 00:13:26,405
[scoffs]

141
00:13:27,338 --> 00:13:28,373
Yeah.

142
00:13:29,474 --> 00:13:32,478
The world is a strange place
these days, isn't it?

143
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,780
But...

144
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:36,314
I guess...

145
00:13:37,148 --> 00:13:38,347
everyone always thinks
they're living

146
00:13:38,349 --> 00:13:39,785
the end of the world.

147
00:13:40,685 --> 00:13:43,188
I remember my, um,
my grandmother...

148
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:47,593
telling me about, uh,
getting under her desk

149
00:13:47,825 --> 00:13:49,494
when they thought the bomb
was gonna drop.

150
00:13:50,695 --> 00:13:51,597
And...

151
00:13:52,564 --> 00:13:53,699
we're still here.

152
00:14:00,338 --> 00:14:01,707
Did you know
there was an earthquake

153
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,776
in View Park last night?

154
00:14:05,175 --> 00:14:05,977
Since when are there...

155
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:08,746
earthquakes in this part
of the country?

156
00:14:10,281 --> 00:14:13,318
Heard about it on the radio.
Headed this way.

157
00:14:14,786 --> 00:14:16,121
Stopped at, uh...

158
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:19,324
the motel there
and talked to a little girl.

159
00:14:19,623 --> 00:14:21,426
Heard all about this woman

160
00:14:21,658 --> 00:14:24,762
who told her and her mother
to seek cover

161
00:14:25,195 --> 00:14:27,798
right before
the earthquake started.

162
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:34,305
You really thought that cop
just showed up out of nowhere?

163
00:14:35,806 --> 00:14:37,209
Who do you think called them?

164
00:14:38,743 --> 00:14:40,112
Ruth?

165
00:14:49,487 --> 00:14:50,389
Ruth...

166
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:52,123
please.

167
00:14:53,157 --> 00:14:56,228
Don't be scared.
I'm a scientist.

168
00:14:56,694 --> 00:14:57,762
I work for the government.

169
00:14:58,897 --> 00:15:02,267
And we've been looking for you
for a very long time.

170
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:04,699
When... when Joe called

171
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:07,171
and he said
he finally found you...

172
00:15:08,272 --> 00:15:11,175
I didn't quite believe him,
but, uh...

173
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,546
he said he saw it
with his own eyes and...

174
00:15:15,813 --> 00:15:17,349
I needed to see it, too.

175
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:21,786
But, by the time I got there,
you were gone.

176
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,190
And Joe was, uh...

177
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,127
You're hurting people, Ruth.

178
00:15:29,227 --> 00:15:30,362
Is that really what you want?

179
00:15:31,496 --> 00:15:32,430
We can help you.

180
00:15:33,297 --> 00:15:34,532
There are tests we can run.

181
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:36,468
- [panting]
- Procedures.

182
00:15:37,502 --> 00:15:38,436
So...

183
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:40,438

366
00:40:27,223 --> 00:40:28,292
- it stays broken.
- it stays broken.

367
00:40:28,924 --> 00:40:29,859
Eat up now.

368
00:40:31,828 --> 00:40:33,197
All we needed was a little glue.

369
00:40:36,899 --> 00:40:38,201
So you can like we can?

370
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:41,672
I can't.

371
00:40:43,772 --> 00:40:44,707
I should.

372
00:40:45,007 --> 00:40:46,076
[inhales]

373
00:40:46,442 --> 00:40:47,944
I did a long time ago.

374
00:40:49,978 --> 00:40:50,881
[Lila] <i>What happened?</i>

375
00:40:56,453 --> 00:40:58,756
- What?
- You've never told her?

376
00:40:59,422 --> 00:41:00,391
Tell me what?

377
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:02,759
Your mother was different.

378
00:41:03,893 --> 00:41:04,828
How?

379
00:41:07,964 --> 00:41:09,266
When she used her abilities...

380
00:41:10,165 --> 00:41:12,068
strange things would happen.

381
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:19,276
<i>And no matter how hard
I tried...</i>

382
00:41:20,176 --> 00:41:21,411
<i>I couldn't figure out why.</i>

383
00:41:23,245 --> 00:41:24,448
I didn't know
what to do with her.

384
00:41:25,781 --> 00:41:27,417
I just didn't know
how to nurture it.

385
00:41:29,252 --> 00:41:31,087
And that's when
the seizures started.

386
00:41:37,026 --> 00:41:38,027
<i>And...</i>

387
00:41:38,495 --> 00:41:39,730
<i>when they did...</i>

388
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:43,100
I couldn't use
my abilities anymore.

389
00:41:44,067 --> 00:41:45,369
So what did you do?

390
00:41:47,504 --> 00:41:48,806
I left.

391
00:41:49,205 --> 00:41:50,207
[Lila] <i>You just left?</i>

392
00:41:51,174 --> 00:41:54,011
<i>I did some things
I shouldn't have done.</i>

393
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:57,280
<i>Spent time with people
I shouldn't have been with.</i>

394
00:41:58,281 --> 00:41:59,183
<i>What do you mean?</i>

395
00:42:00,049 --> 00:42:02,152
I was...

396
00:42:04,087 --> 00:42:05,022
sick...

397
00:42:06,388 --> 00:42:07,323
for a long time.

398
00:42:07,991 --> 00:42:09,426
Did you make her some medicine?

399
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:11,861
I did, honey but it didn't work.

400
00:42:13,096 --> 00:42:14,098
What did you have?

401
00:42:14,997 --> 00:42:17,198
It's not that kind of sick.

402
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,404
Um, I can't really explain it,
but, um...

403
00:42:21,538 --> 00:42:23,507
when I was...

404
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:25,743
sick...

405
00:42:27,009 --> 00:42:28,245
the seizures went away.

406
00:42:29,279 --> 00:42:31,181
[Lila] And did your abilities
come back?

407
00:42:34,484 --> 00:42:35,384
[Ruth] <i>They never did.</i>

408
00:42:37,453 --> 00:42:39,920
[Bo] <i>I knew the back
of your mother's head</i>

409
00:42:39,922 --> 00:42:41,825
<i>better than I knew her face.</i>

410
00:42:43,493 --> 00:42:47,163
- If you left, then how did I...
- I came back.

411
00:42:47,964 --> 00:42:48,698
With you.

412
00:42:49,431 --> 00:42:52,136
I was so messed up
by that point...

413
00:42:53,435 --> 00:42:54,403
I couldn't stay.

414
00:42:56,172 --> 00:42:57,908
So why is it okay now?

415
00:43:02,312 --> 00:43:03,947
Your mother needs our help.

416
00:43:07,082 --> 00:43:12,088
I think if Bo can help me
with my abilities...

417
00:43:13,323 --> 00:43:14,892
the seizures might go away.

418
00:43:20,529 --> 00:43:22,165
Why don't you show your mother
what you can do?

419
00:43:23,031 --> 00:43:24,000
Huh?

420
00:43:24,466 --> 00:43:25,368
Go on.

421
00:43:26,502 --> 00:43:27,404
Show her.

422
00:43:44,953 --> 00:43:46,957
[inhales deeply]

423
00:44:53,056 --> 00:44:54,024
[Ruth] You can see them?

424
00:44:54,524 --> 00:44:55,459
[Lila] She can.

425
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:58,094
And she still
finds it interesting.

426
00:44:59,428 --> 00:45:00,363
You don't?

427
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:04,100
I've been seeing the colors
for 52 years.

428
00:45:12,207 --> 00:45:13,276
What do they look like?

429
00:45:15,611 --> 00:45:16,546
You don't know?

430
00:45:18,614 --> 00:45:19,650
I've never seen them.

431
00:45:22,051 --> 00:45:22,953
Why not?

432
00:45:26,122 --> 00:45:27,024
I don't know.

433
00:45:28,491 --> 00:45:29,426
I just...

434
00:45:30,759 --> 00:45:31,661
can't.

435
00:45:32,562 --> 00:45:34,230
Hasn't Bo told you
what they look like?

436
00:45:36,165 --> 00:45:38,067
I think she wants to hear it
from you.

437
00:45:40,069 --> 00:45:40,971
Um...

438
00:45:42,638 --> 00:45:46,076
After you put back together
whatever it is you took apart,

439
00:45:46,475 --> 00:45:49,613
everyone sees this object,
but you see the colors.

440
00:45:50,645 --> 00:45:53,015
It's like an after-effect.

441
00:45:53,515 --> 00:45:54,651
An echo.

442
00:45:56,118 --> 00:45:58,421
Suddenly,
there are all these colors.

443
00:46:00,056 --> 00:46:02,192
Moving... over everything.

444
00:46:03,292 --> 00:46:04,393
Fast, like a race.

445
00:46:05,761 --> 00:46:07,064
How does it feel?

446
00:46:09,098 --> 00:46:10,033
Really warm.

447
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:14,004
It's like when you're about
to cry but you're happy.

448
00:46:16,205 --> 00:46:17,140
Bo says...

449
00:46:17,973 --> 00:46:19,241
if you do something
really big...

450
00:46:20,109 --> 00:46:21,678
the colors can last a long time.

451
00:46:23,578 --> 00:46:25,348
But just when you forget
where you are...

452
00:46:27,149 --> 00:46:28,050
<i>they're gone.</i>

453
00:46:29,585 --> 00:46:30,554
Everything's just...

454
00:46:31,486 --> 00:46:32,488
normal again.

455
00:46:44,567 --> 00:46:47,103
[metallic clanking]

456
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:08,290
Sheila.

457
00:47:09,357 --> 00:47:12,092
Has the analysis of the evidence
not come back yet?

458
00:47:12,094 --> 00:47:13,562
- You didn't hear?
- No.

459
00:47:14,129 --> 00:47:15,064
Didn't hear what?

460
00:47:16,198 --> 00:47:17,733
These other men, they said
they were taking it over.

461
00:47:18,433 --> 00:47:19,600
W... What other men?

462
00:47:19,602 --> 00:47:21,071
W... What the hell
are you talking about?

463
00:47:23,138 --> 00:47:24,073
You should call the lab.

464
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,339
Yeah, that's precisely why

465
00:47:26,341 --> 00:47:27,443
we take care
of our own business.

466
00:47:27,843 --> 00:47:28,909
[girl] <i>Well, times have changed</i>

467
00:47:28,911 --> 00:47:31,478
<i>and we're not able
to do anything about that.</i>

468
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,750
I mean, I... I understand that,
but there needs to be some...

469
00:47:35,484 --> 00:47:37,720
some semblance of order, right?
You can't just...

470
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:40,221
<i>Well, they took the samples.</i>

471
00:47:40,223 --> 00:47:42,058
<i>There's nothing you can do
about it now, all right?</i>

472
00:47:42,457 --> 00:47:44,525
Well, you do know
that those samples

473
00:47:44,527 --> 00:47:45,762
were the only evidence we had.

474
00:48:31,506 --> 00:48:32,575
[Bo] <i>Don't forget to breathe.</i>

475
00:48:34,343 --> 00:48:35,678
See the bucket in your mind.

476
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,448
Inhale slowly.

477
00:48:39,881 --> 00:48:42,251
Just feel your connection
to everything.

478
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:46,556
Feel how everything
is tied together.

479
00:48:47,857 --> 00:48:49,593
When you exhale...

480
00:48:51,227 --> 00:48:52,529
release the ties.

481
00:48:59,669 --> 00:49:02,138
- I'm so...
- It's okay, just breathe.

482
00:49:02,705 --> 00:49:04,207
Breathe. That's enough for now.

483
00:49:09,611 --> 00:49:11,280
<i>"Extraordinary discovery.</i>

484
00:49:12,348 --> 00:49:15,348
My daughter, Martha,
can also disintegrate objects

485
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:16,719
and put them
back together again.

486
00:49:17,553 --> 00:49:19,723
Do these abilities
run in our family?

487
00:49:20,556 --> 00:49:22,355
I wish my mother were alive

488
00:49:22,357 --> 00:49:24,660
so I could ask
if she could do this, too.

489
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:29,265
If she could... I don't know why
she never told me."

490
00:49:30,933 --> 00:49:32,268
Whose writing is that?

491
00:49:32,902 --> 00:49:33,870
My great-grandmother.

492
00:49:35,404 --> 00:49:38,275
All the women in our family
write in this book.

493
00:49:38,741 --> 00:49:40,509
I don't know, I thought,
maybe there would be...

494
00:49:41,343 --> 00:49:43,379
something in here
to help guide us.

495
00:49:51,286 --> 00:49:52,855
"This land is so beautiful.

496
00:49:54,422 --> 00:49:56,792
Martha wants to plant flowers
along the path.

497
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,497
I already feel
that we are safer.

498
00:50:02,631 --> 00:50:03,566
It was too dangerous

499
00:50:04,533 --> 00:50:05,568
after what happened
with Martha at school.

500
00:50:06,935 --> 00:50:08,337
I couldn't bear the fear.

501
00:50:10,372 --> 00:50:12,306
Here, we can live
our lives in peace

502
00:50:12,308 --> 00:50:13,843
and no one will know
our secret."

503
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,517
I knew this was Grandma's house,
but I didn't realize...

504
00:50:22,417 --> 00:50:25,555
The women in our family
have lived here for generations.

505
00:50:27,957 --> 00:50:30,627
Oh. Why didn't you ever tell me
any of this?

506
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:32,962
You weren't that big on history.

507
00:50:34,363 --> 00:50:36,265
- [footsteps approaching]
- [Lila] I have an idea.

508
00:50:36,899 --> 00:50:39,569
- Yes?
- What if, instead of the bucket,

509
00:50:39,968 --> 00:50:41,837
you just thought about
when I took the bowl apart?

510
00:50:42,672 --> 00:50:44,241
Instead of having to imagine...

511
00:50:44,906 --> 00:50:45,874
you could just remember.

512
00:51:08,797 --> 00:51:09,832
[glass shatters]

513
00:51:11,433 --> 00:51:12,699
- [Bo] What the...
- [Ruth] I don't...

514
00:51:12,701 --> 00:51:13,602
I'll go look.

515
00:51:21,977 --> 00:51:23,580
- What happened?
- I don't know.

516
00:51:27,382 --> 00:51:28,317
There's nothing.

517
00:51:28,984 --> 00:51:29,919
Nothing hit it.

518
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:32,055
Just a bunch of broken glass.

519
00:51:38,127 --> 00:51:39,895
Yours are different, right?

520
00:51:41,997 --> 00:51:42,899
Yeah.

521
00:51:46,835 --> 00:51:47,904
Did you do this?

522
00:51:51,607 --> 00:51:52,542
I don't know.

523
00:51:55,076 --> 00:51:55,978
I've been...

524
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:59,948
so disconnected from them
for such a long time, I...

525
00:52:01,049 --> 00:52:03,553
don't remember what it's like
to actually do something.

526
00:52:05,788 --> 00:52:06,890
[glass clattering]

527
00:52:09,158 --> 00:52:10,460
Are there others?

528
00:52:12,127 --> 00:52:14,330
- Other...
- Women.

529
00:52:14,864 --> 00:52:16,833
- Like us.
- I don't think so.

530
00:52:21,536 --> 00:52:23,473
But isn't that narciss...

531
00:52:24,839 --> 00:52:26,408
Narcissistic?

532
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:28,544
[chuckles]

533
00:52:29,444 --> 00:52:30,446
Uh...

534
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,449
yeah, it is.

535
00:52:34,049 --> 00:52:36,820
I mean,
if we've always been hiding...

536
00:52:37,919 --> 00:52:38,854
how do we know?

537
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:49,730
Did Bo ever tell you
about Simona?

538
00:52:49,732 --> 00:52:51,701
- Who?
- Don't get excited.

539
00:52:53,067 --> 00:52:54,002
Bo made her up.

540
00:52:55,103 --> 00:52:57,707
She lived in Europe, I think.

541
00:52:58,674 --> 00:53:01,378
And she could do things
we couldn't do.

542
00:53:01,977 --> 00:53:04,114
Like,
she could take apart the sky.

543
00:53:06,147 --> 00:53:08,617
I think Bo did it to help me.

544
00:53:09,884 --> 00:53:10,786
Like...

01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,377
I'm not leaving, all right?

724
01:08:03,578 --> 01:08:04,580
I'm not leaving.

725
01:08:26,568 --> 01:08:28,304
[Bill] <i>We saw a girl in town.</i>

726
01:08:28,702 --> 01:08:30,605
It looked just like her.
I think, uh...

727
01:08:30,971 --> 01:08:33,408
I think it's her family.
I think that's why she's here.

728
01:08:33,774 --> 01:08:35,544
- Now, my men...
- They're not happy.

729
01:08:36,144 --> 01:08:37,646
I just need a little more time.

730
01:08:37,845 --> 01:08:39,945
You left a car with blood
and bullet holes

731
01:08:39,947 --> 01:08:40,882
by the side of the road.

732
01:08:41,983 --> 01:08:43,651
Well, I couldn't just drive
a crime scene into town.

733
01:08:43,984 --> 01:08:45,685
So you just left it there
for them to find?

734
01:08:45,687 --> 01:08:48,721
I'm a scientist, okay?
I sit in a room all day.

735
01:08:48,723 --> 01:08:49,725
I'm collecting data.

736
01:08:50,791 --> 01:08:51,891
Getting her was supposed
to be Joe's job, not mine.

737
01:08:51,893 --> 01:08:54,962
Yeah, well, see, Bill,
that's precisely the point.

738
01:08:56,831 --> 01:08:59,468
- You had her and you lost her.
- [sighs]

739
01:09:00,635 --> 01:09:01,868
They're running out of patience.

740
01:09:01,870 --> 01:09:04,003
We have never
been this close before.

741
01:09:04,005 --> 01:09:05,607
You have to make them
\understand.

742
01:09:06,573 --> 01:09:08,109
You... you saw our research,
right?

743
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:11,677
This woman can cause
tectonic plates to shift.

744
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:13,082
Plates that have never moved
before.

745
01:09:13,881 --> 01:09:14,750
Do you realize what that means?

746
01:09:15,916 --> 01:09:18,486
She can affect the energy
of the Earth.

747
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,820
And they're running out
of patience

748
01:09:20,822 --> 01:09:22,458
because I needed backup?

749
01:09:55,956 --> 01:09:57,158
[door squeaks open]

750
01:09:59,126 --> 01:10:00,094
[door shuts]

751
01:10:46,573 --> 01:10:49,143
The first time
I left this house...

752
01:10:50,612 --> 01:10:51,680
I met your father.

753
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:57,319
My mother wouldn't even...

754
01:10:58,152 --> 01:11:00,656
take me to town with her
when she went.

755
01:11:01,755 --> 01:11:02,690
So...

756
01:11:04,759 --> 01:11:06,127
one day, I snuck out.

757
01:11:08,162 --> 01:11:10,232
Got as far
as the edge of Garrison...

758
01:11:11,765 --> 01:11:13,902
and stopped at the candy store.

759
01:11:16,604 --> 01:11:19,975
I could not believe
that there was a room

760
01:11:20,274 --> 01:11:25,277
somewhere in the world
that was full of candy.

761
01:11:25,279 --> 01:11:26,482
[both chuckle]

762
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:30,953
I just stood there
staring in the window.

763
01:11:32,019 --> 01:11:33,985
He was across the street
with his father, you know,

764
01:11:33,987 --> 01:11:35,623
where the old hardware store
used to be.

765
01:11:36,991 --> 01:11:37,893
Came over.

766
01:11:39,693 --> 01:11:40,795
Bought me a piece of...

767
01:11:41,796 --> 01:11:44,030
- blueberry taffy.
- [truck engine sputtering]

768
01:11:44,032 --> 01:11:46,902
And he walked with me
just for a little.

769
01:11:48,036 --> 01:11:52,507
We did that almost
every Saturday for a year...

770
01:11:53,575 --> 01:11:55,010
until my mother found out.

771
01:11:57,778 --> 01:11:58,813
When she did...

772
01:12:00,648 --> 01:12:02,885
even this front yard
was off limits.

773
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:09,091
But enough time went by
and she lowered her guard.

774
01:12:12,026 --> 01:12:13,161
I saw him again.

775
01:12:14,795 --> 01:12:16,531
We came up with a secret signal.

776
01:12:18,299 --> 01:12:20,536
We'd meet
at the high school track...

777
01:12:21,269 --> 01:12:22,938
in the middle of the night.

778
01:12:24,639 --> 01:12:25,873
[truck engine sputtering]

779
01:12:31,112 --> 01:12:34,116
By the time mother
caught on again...

780
01:12:36,984 --> 01:12:38,653
I was pregnant with you.

781
01:12:49,162 --> 01:12:50,998
I don't wanna mess it up
this time.

782
01:12:53,001 --> 01:12:53,902
I...

783
01:12:54,736 --> 01:12:56,134
We're all just doing
the same thing

784
01:12:56,136 --> 01:12:57,906
over and over again

785
01:12:58,206 --> 01:13:01,710
hoping that someone
will get it right.

786
01:13:02,242 --> 01:13:03,678
[truck engine revving]

787
01:13:09,282 --> 01:13:13,721
Oh, my... You did it! [laughs]

788
01:13:13,955 --> 01:13:18,260
Oh, my God. I can't...
Let me see that.

789
01:13:19,426 --> 01:13:20,728
Well...

790
01:13:22,764 --> 01:13:24,833
I told you if you did it,
you can have it.

791
01:13:26,067 --> 01:13:27,769
I am so proud of you.

792
01:13:28,169 --> 01:13:31,073
- Come here.
- Technically, it's my truck.

793
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:36,711
So I'm the only one
who can give it to you.

794
01:13:38,446 --> 01:13:40,881
And... I guess you can have it.

795
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:46,622
What're those?

796
01:13:48,121 --> 01:13:49,123
Tools.

797
01:13:49,357 --> 01:13:50,759
Yes, I'm aware of that.

798
01:13:51,358 --> 01:13:53,194
But where'd they come from?

799
01:13:54,394 --> 01:13:55,296
I found them.

800
01:13:56,464 --> 01:13:57,366
Where?

801
01:13:57,965 --> 01:13:58,867
In the shed.

802
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:01,770
Those tools are new, Lila.

803
01:14:03,904 --> 01:14:05,172
You've never lied to me.

804
01:14:07,841 --> 01:14:09,210
How'd you get them
out of the store?

805
01:14:12,412 --> 01:14:13,314
Lila?

806
01:14:16,017 --> 01:14:17,385
Did you have something
to do with this?

807
01:14:18,318 --> 01:14:20,656
- What? No.
- She didn't do anything.

808
01:14:24,291 --> 01:14:26,060
This is not what our abilities
are for.

809
01:14:26,461 --> 01:14:28,263
Then what are they for?

810
01:14:29,263 --> 01:14:30,297
What's the fucking point?

811
01:14:35,001 --> 01:14:37,238
Go inside now. Both of you. Now.

812
01:14:54,788 --> 01:14:57,125
What's going on?
What are you doing here, Dean?

813
01:14:57,959 --> 01:14:59,461
Don't worry, Bonnie,
I'm not here to take her in.

814
01:15:03,397 --> 01:15:04,763
[Bo] If you're not here
to take her in,

815
01:15:04,765 --> 01:15:05,933
then why are you here?

816
01:15:07,035 --> 01:15:08,437
There's a lot more to it
than I told you last night.

817
01:15:11,272 --> 01:15:12,207
They know, Bonnie.

818
01:15:13,507 --> 01:15:14,408
They know.

819
01:15:15,309 --> 01:15:16,110
They've been following her
for months.

820
01:15:17,377 --> 01:15:19,246
It's something about doing tests
on you.

821
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:21,215
They've tracked you to town.

822
01:15:21,482 --> 01:15:23,151
You need to go.
There's not much time.

823
01:15:28,355 --> 01:15:30,392
If I'd have told you,
would you have let me stay?

824
01:15:33,193 --> 01:15:34,196
Hey.

825
01:15:35,496 --> 01:15:36,732
Why are you helping us?

826
01:15:39,466 --> 01:15:40,469
She doesn't know?

827
01:15:45,872 --> 01:15:46,808
Lila...

828
01:15:47,041 --> 01:15:47,943
this is my dad.

829
01:15:48,809 --> 01:15:49,777
Your grandfather.

830
01:15:55,550 --> 01:15:56,885
Hey, you, uh...

831
01:15:57,885 --> 01:15:59,888
you know about
your mom's seizures, right?

832
01:16:01,956 --> 01:16:04,589
Well, wh... when they started
it was dangerous

833
01:16:04,591 --> 01:16:07,362
for all of us to live in town.

834
01:16:08,461 --> 01:16:10,098
So your Bo

835
01:16:10,464 --> 01:16:13,868
decided it was best that she
and your mom move out here.

836
01:16:14,434 --> 01:16:16,537
Back to the house
that Bo grew up in.

837
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:19,073
That's why
we haven't been together.

838
01:16:26,279 --> 01:16:27,181
Go.

839
01:16:36,023 --> 01:16:37,890
- Take me with you.
- Lila.

840
01:16:37,892 --> 01:16:39,124
- Please!
- Lila.

841
01:16:39,126 --> 01:16:40,892
Please. Please.

842
01:16:40,894 --> 01:16:42,263
You know how I told you
I was sick?

843
01:16:43,496 --> 01:16:45,366
I'm a drug addict, Lila.

844
01:16:46,166 --> 01:16:47,333
I was so messed up,

845
01:16:47,335 --> 01:16:49,203
I don't even know
who your father is.

846
01:16:50,438 --> 01:16:52,274
I got sober
when you were born and...

847
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,473
for a while the seizures
didn't happen

848
01:16:55,475 --> 01:16:56,510
and I thought maybe...

849
01:16:58,144 --> 01:16:59,080
you'd fixed me.

850
01:17:00,581 --> 01:17:01,483
But then...

851
01:17:02,649 --> 01:17:03,551
one morning...

852
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:06,822
it came back.

853
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:09,355
So you left me. Now you're just
gonna leave me again?

854
01:17:09,357 --> 01:17:11,593
Our abilities mean shit,
Lila! All right?

855
01:17:12,526 --> 01:17:14,362
There is nothing out there!

856
01:17:15,095 --> 01:17:17,131
It's just a horrible place
full of horrible people!

857
01:17:18,532 --> 01:17:20,335
- [truck door shuts]
- [truck engine revving]

858
01:17:20,968 --> 01:17:22,267
Come here, sweetheart.
Come here.

859
01:17:22,269 --> 01:17:23,237
Just go!

860
01:17:25,038 --> 01:17:25,940
All of you!

861
01:18:11,218 --> 01:18:13,054
[sighs] Shit, shit, shit.

862
01:18:25,966 --> 01:18:28,937
[engine sputtering]

863
01:18:31,505 --> 01:18:34,009
[rattlesnake rattling]

864
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:07,434
[panting]

865
01:20:22,382 --> 01:20:23,451
[gasps]

866
01:20:36,831 --> 01:20:38,199
[gasping]

867
01:21:05,392 --> 01:21:06,560
[baby crying]

868
01:21:41,162 --> 01:21:42,464
[panting]

869
01:23:00,006 --> 01:23:00,942
Mom!

870
01:23:06,913 --> 01:23:07,948
Lila?

871
01:23:11,417 --> 01:23:12,353
Lila!

872
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:14,922
Mom!

873
01:23:18,992 --> 01:23:20,361
[knocking]

874
01:23:21,894 --> 01:23:23,661
- Where are they?
- Ruth, what are you doing here?

875
01:23:23,663 --> 01:23:25,200
- You should be gone.
- Where are they?

876
01:23:25,532 --> 01:23:27,402
- Your mother's on her way here.
- And Lila?

877
01:23:28,836 --> 01:23:30,768
Those men came to the house
looking for you.

878
01:23:30,770 --> 01:23:31,672
Where's Lila?

879
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:34,809
- They took her to the station.
- What?

880
01:23:35,675 --> 01:23:37,844
When they came to the house,
she used her abilities.

881
01:23:39,479 --> 01:23:40,380
Why?

882
01:23:41,514 --> 01:23:42,614
She thought
she could make them

883
01:23:42,616 --> 01:23:43,618
stop looking for you.

884
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:48,656
You can't go, Ruth.
They've taken it over.

885
01:23:49,055 --> 01:23:49,991
Your mother's there now.

886
01:23:51,058 --> 01:23:53,361
She will be here soon,
and we just have to wait.

887
01:23:56,663 --> 01:23:58,765
You know,
in case you're wondering, um...

888
01:23:59,433 --> 01:24:02,303
you know, after you left,
I sold the body shop...

889
01:24:03,836 --> 01:24:05,305
and I became a sheriff.

890
01:24:07,707 --> 01:24:09,978
I figured it was the best way
to... [sighs]

891
01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:11,578
...take care of you all and...

892
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:14,649
maybe even find you.

893
01:24:19,819 --> 01:24:22,556
Whenever there was a case
of a woman gone missing, it's...

894
01:24:22,956 --> 01:24:23,891
it's always you.

895
01:24:25,024 --> 01:24:25,993
[scoffs]

896
01:24:27,461 --> 01:24:28,393
I've been doing it for so long

897
01:24:28,395 --> 01:24:30,697
I can't remember
when it started. [scoffs]

898
01:24:34,801 --> 01:24:36,737
How did you know
it was me this time?

899
01:24:37,571 --> 01:24:39,741
A bartender,
out at the place near Valley's.

Is that right?

902
01:24:48,916 --> 01:24:50,451
- Dean, you gotta get...
- Mom.

903
01:24:50,684 --> 01:24:52,987
- Ruth, what are you doing here?
- Where's Lila?

904
01:24:53,586 --> 01:24:54,522
They won't let me see her.

905
01:24:54,822 --> 01:24:56,454
- You've gotta go.
- I can't.

906
01:24:56,456 --> 01:24:57,491
- Ruth?
- I saw the colors.

907
01:25:00,928 --> 01:25:03,331
- What?
- I did. [panting]

908
01:25:03,764 --> 01:25:04,666
I saw them.

909
01:25:05,565 --> 01:25:06,567
Right after I left.

910
01:25:08,568 --> 01:25:10,638
You were right that someone
could take apart the sky.

911
01:25:11,904 --> 01:25:13,041
But it's not Simona.

912
01:25:18,545 --> 01:25:19,480
I'm gonna get Lila.

913
01:25:19,746 --> 01:25:20,745
- No.
- It's okay. Mom,

914
01:25:20,747 --> 01:25:21,713
- No.
- it's okay. It's okay.

915
01:25:21,715 --> 01:25:22,617
I'm in control.

916
01:25:24,651 --> 01:25:26,653
I started to have a seizure
but I stopped it.

917
01:25:28,755 --> 01:25:29,890
I'm in control now.

918
01:25:34,495 --> 01:25:37,061
For so long, I was haunted
by the pipes breaking

919
01:25:37,063 --> 01:25:38,665
and the walls and the water
but...

920
01:25:40,901 --> 01:25:42,603
I couldn't remember her face.

921
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:48,109
I'm not scared anymore.

922
01:26:01,788 --> 01:26:02,956
Bonnie, we gotta go after her.

923
01:26:06,693 --> 01:26:08,830
I know you think we might
not be able to stop those men,

924
01:26:09,129 --> 01:26:10,931
- but we gotta try.
- You don't understand.

925

926

wasn't just because of Ruth.

927
01:26:20,541 --> 01:26:23,111
I'm not afraid
that I can't stop these men.

928
01:26:26,013 --> 01:26:27,148

- It's her.
- Hands in the air!

938
01:30:26,752 --> 01:30:27,886
- Okay, give me a minute here.
- Put your hands up.

- Give me a minute.
- Don't move.

- Can we just...
- Let us handle this, sir.

941
01:30:31,090 --> 01:30:32,423
She doesn't have a weapon.

They're children.
You don't want them.

Take me instead.

01:31:24,443 --> 01:31:26,343
Bonnie,
that's not what we planned.

953
01:31:26,345 --> 01:31:29,481
No, I know, but they'll just
keep coming after us.

They'll always come after us,
