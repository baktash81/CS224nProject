1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
23.976

2
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,957
Ah!

3
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:55,430
- There you are, Tod.
- Shh!

4
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:57,640
I found one.

5
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:01,770
No way!
Look at the size of that thing.

6
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:04,981
- Sure is ugly.
- It's a monster!

7
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:09,235
I can smell its evil breath from here.

8
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,572
No, uh, that's me.
I had socks for lunch.

9
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,824
Ugh!

10
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,743
Uh, how about you take this one?

11
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:20,497
- Come on. We're a team, right?
- Wanna shake on it?

12
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,874
Shake on it.

13
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:29,005
- Ready... set...
- Go!

14
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:33,301
Come on, Copper!

15
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,470
Whoa!

16
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:38,014
Come on, keep up!

17
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,599
Wait for me!

18
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:47,482
Huh?

19
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:06,209
Whoa!

20
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,357
We got him now!

21
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:53,506
Ha-ha-ha! We chasing crickets,
or are we just hanging out?

22
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,051
I messed up again.

23
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:05,018
- I can't do nothing right.
- Hey, that's not true.

24
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:09,147
You're... you're...
You're housetrained, ain't ya?

25
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,900
Oh, Copper.

26
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,198
Race ya!

27
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,243
Wow! The trucks for the fair.

28
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,080
I've never seen so much stuff in my life.

29
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,793
Oh, boy! I can't wait.

30
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,711
- Are you goin'?
- I'm-a goin'.

31
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,713
- You goin'?
- I'm-a goin'.

32
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,299
Chief says you
can win a ribbon there.

33
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,302
- Really? For what?
- Just for being a good dog.

34
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:42,555
Whoa!
That's a pretty good pumpkin.

35
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,725
That one's even bigger.

36
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,437
And noisier.

37
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:57,654
Hey, Tod, do you hear that?

38
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,783
Whoa! Oh!

39
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,076
Oh!

40
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:20,135
- You OK?
- Tripped over my own ears.

41
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:25,306
See? I told ya.
I'm just a bad dog.

42
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,559
Ah, don't be like that.

43
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:31,354
- Copper!
- Uh-oh. Time for my hunting lesson.

44
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,482
Hey, maybe I'll be good at hunting.

45
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:38,445
Yeah! I'm gonna be
the huntingest puppy ever.

46
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,114
Now you're talkin'.

47
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:54,127
Let's see now.

48
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,588
Copper!

49
00:04:56,671 --> 00:05:01,926
Copper! Oh, where did
that pup gone off to?

50
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,928
Mm. Hmph!

51
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,851
Hi, Chief.
Ready for my lesson.

52
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:14,064
Oh, darn my hide.
Playing nursemaid to a pup

53
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,025
when I should be a-practicin'
for the contest.

54
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,611
Aw, you don't need to practice.

55
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,030
You're the best hunting dog
in the whole county.

56
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:25,950
Well, I reckon it's true.
I mean, they don't give

57
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:29,037
those fourth-place prizes
to just anybody.

58
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:33,792
Oh, there you are, Copper.
We'll make a hunting dog out of you yet.

59
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,461
Here, here. Snuff this up.

60
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:41,049
Now, when this rabbit takes off,
you follow his scent.

61
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:46,721
Then when you have him, let loose with
a big ol' hound-dog howl!

62
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:52,519
I must be going deaf.
I said howl!

63
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:02,237
You're gonna lose your head
one of these days, Amos Slade.

64
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:05,490
{Y:i}It's my head, woman!

65
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,034
Good boy. Heh-heh.

66
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:12,038
OK, Chief. Get goin'!

67
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:16,835
- What are you waiting for? Go get him!
- Go, Copper!

68
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,971
Attaboy, Copper!

69
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:34,477
Ahh! Pup's as useful
as a milk bucket under a bull.

70
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,611
Tod!
Oh, I'm getting all turned around.

71
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,739
I don't know what I'm doing.

72
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,992
It's easy.
You just sniff him out.

73
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:52,287
When you smell him,
lift up your head and howl.

74
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,164
Like this?

75
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,126
No, not me!

76
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,631
- Uh-oh.
- Gotta go!

77
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,849
Ow! Ding-dang it all!

78
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:18,480
Ha! I've got ya now.

79
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,861
Come back here, you little varmint!

80
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,780
Excuse me. Coming through.

81
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,201
Uh-oh.

82
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,744
Uh-oh.

83
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,664
- My milk!
- Oh, no!

84
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:42,796
Abigail, wait!
Amos Slade!

85
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,845
I've gotcha now!

86
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,032
Uh-oh.

87
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:18,998
Amos Slade, I told you to keep
your beast away from my Tod!

88
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:23,086
That mangy hound of yours
just cost me a bucket of milk!

89
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:29,926
Your fox was after my chickens, Tweed!
What do I care about your milk?

90
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,221
Well, as long as you're wasting my milk,

91
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,099
you may as well have some pie
to go along with it.

92
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,393
What the dickens are you...

93
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,902
Bad dog, Copper!

94
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:51,740
You are a very bad dog!

95
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:59,497
Well, you can just forget
about the fair, Copper.

96
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,249
Oh, dagnabit.

97
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:05,337
You couldn't find a rabbit
at a petting zoo on Easter Sunday.

98
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,382
There. That oughta keep
you out of trouble.

99
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:12,052
Let's go, Chief.
Fair's a-waitin'.

100
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,064
Aw, you'll get it one day, boy.

101
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:27,275
You just gotta grow up a little, is all.

102
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:54,260
He got you over a barrel, huh?

103
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:57,347
Well, say something.

104
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,475
There's nothing to say.

105
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,687
It's just what I'm good for - nothing.

106
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,815
You're real good at getting into trouble.

107
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,408
'Course you're good at
something, Copper.

108
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,494
We just gotta figure out what.

109
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,665
You know what you need?
A little fun.

110
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:27,502
I wonder if there's
a county fair around here.

111
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,463
Come to think of it, there is!

112
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,967
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm a little tied up right now.

113
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,178
Nothing a fox can't fix.

114
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:42,684
Whoo-hoo!

115
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,409
- What do you wanna do first?
- Everything.

116
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,454
Mom! Fireworks, fireworks!

117
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:06,041
Balloons! Ice cream!
Come on!

118
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,793
- Fireworks.
- Oh, yeah.

119
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:12,047
- We've gotta see 'em.
- Smack at sundown.

120
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,759
Shake on it!

121
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:19,054
There's that sound again.

122
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,100
Sounds pretty good.

123
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,729
Sounds like somebody got
their tail stuck in a door.

124
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,704
Voice like an angel...
with looks to match.

125
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,247
Oh, please.

126
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,796
- Aah!
- Oh!

127
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,465
Oh, my poor...

128
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,593
Darn this one-horse,
two-bit, free-timing fair!

129
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:02,931
Now, Dixie, it ain't like it smacked your
singing. Can we get back to rehearsing?

130
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:05,767
I refuse to work under these conditions.

131
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:09,020
- Uh-oh. Here we go.
- Well, I'll tell you what, Dixie.

132
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:13,608
You rehearse, and afterwards I'll give
that piece of wood a good old talking-to.

133
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,361
- I got two bones on Dixie.
- I'll cover that.

134
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:20,699
It just so happens I am a professional,
and my standards...

135
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,867
Oh, now, Dixie, darling,

136
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:27,122
you put on that same old record every day.
Ain't it just about wore out by now?

137
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,290
You have some nerve talking
to me that way.

138
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:32,460
If your ear were any more tin,
they could can beans with it.

139
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:36,881
Well, you listen to me, Miss Fancy Tail.
In a couple of days, we will be

140
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:40,677
in front of that talent scout
from the Grand Old Opry.

141
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:46,599
I get possibly maimed for life, and all you
can talk about is the Grand Old Opry?

142
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,643
- Now, Dixie...
- I'll be in my trailer.

143
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:53,690
Darling, we got a show to do.
You can't just walk...

144
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,400
...away.

145
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,530
Sometimes I dislike that woman.

146
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:04,367
If they disliked each other any more,
they'd have to get hitched.

147
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:08,121
- We're o...
- Ooh!

148
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,165
Sorry, fellas.

149
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:13,918
Oh, I can tell right now, this is gonna be
the worst show of all time!

150
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:17,547
It's gonna be the worst!

151
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,550
OK, let's have fun out there!

152
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,680
- Cash, who will sing Dixie's part?
- Just give me a second.

153
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:29,100
- I do a pretty good Dixie.
- Waylon, I don't picture you doing Di...

154
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,857
Sit!

155
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:39,444
OK. Here's the good news.

156
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,697
Granny Rose, you are
singing Dixie's part.

157
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:46,534
- Me?
- Oh, she's gonna love this one.

158
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:49,454
We have a real treat for you now.

159
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:53,333
Lyle Snotgrass and The Singin' Strays.

160
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:16,606
You could almost swear
them dogs are really singing.

161
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,857
Come on, kid. Sing with us.

162
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:20,920
What?

163
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:39,522
Yeah!

164
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:45,195
- Oh, yeah.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

165
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,990
Hot dog! Listen to 'em, Cash.
They love that number.

166
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,826
Yeah, and if a cow had wheels,
it'd be a milk truck.

167
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:55,497
That song is hokey.
They're clapping for this little puppy.

168
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,458
Well, the kid's cute, all right.

169
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,797
Ha-ha-ha!
Kid, I'll tell you what.

170
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,549
You can sing!
You got pipes of gold.

171
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:09,177
You sure do!

172
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,429
- Hey, kid, what's your name?
- Copper.

173
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:13,932
Copper, thanks for getting us
out of a tight spot.

174
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:17,686
- It was fun!
- You got a future in show business, kid.

175
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,271
You come back and see us
in a couple of years, you hear?

176
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:25,443
- Yep, in a couple of years.
- 'Cause being in a band takes maturity.

177
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,987
What?

178
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,156
What?

179
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:35,036
- What just happened?
- I'll tell you what happened.

180
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:39,040
You're good at something,
and I mean good!

181
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:40,667
Whoo-hoo!

182
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:47,298
- Just what do you think you're doing?
- A little audience participation.

183
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:50,385
- That kid wowed 'em.
- Kid? What kid?

184
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:54,180
- Bye, Mr. Cash.
- That kid.

185
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:58,435
- Little critter was heaven-sent.
- That sang my lead?

186
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,729
Oh, no.
He didn't just sing it.

187
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:03,023
{Y:i}He sang it.

188
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:06,067
You don't mean to tell me
that wet-behind-the-ears puppy

189
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,194
could ever take my place in a band.

190
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:14,117
I didn't say that. Although he does have
that refreshing, blooming youth about him.

191
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,288
- Just what exactly are you saying?
- What do you think I'm saying?

192
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,875
- You're saying what I think you're saying.
- I think you know what I think I'm saying.

193
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,961
You'd better know that what you're saying
isn't what I think you're saying.

194
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:26,338
Why do you always...

195
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,715
- Only 'cause you never...
- What if I said to you...

196
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,468
Ooh! You know, this is just
like the time when you...

197
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:35,096
You better not bring that up.

198
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:41,644
Hmph! Well, I think we've both
been perfectly clear.

199
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,481
Ohh, perfectly.

200
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,483
- I quit!
- Huh?

201
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,614
- Cash, what are we gonna do?
- She's gone with the wind.

202
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,076
Sit!

203
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:01,915
I'll take care of this. I'd better.
That talent scout will be here any minute.

204
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:15,303
- Hi, there.
- Well, who are you?

205
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:18,807
Olivia Farmer, designated chaperone
to Winchell P. Bickerstaff,

206
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,185
talent scout
from the Grand Old Opry. That's you.

207
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,978
Ahem. Chaperone, huh?

208
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,023
I'm working to get
my community service merit badge.

209
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,693
Well, that's quite admirable,
little lady.

210
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:32,362
Then I'll have more
than Sally Ann Merrybaum.

211
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,447
Thinks she's so great.

212
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:39,327
Well, lead on, Miss Farmer.
I'm a-lookin' for some talent.

213
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:52,924
Oh, Dixie, you ain't mad
over a little joshing, are ya?

214
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:58,596
I was only teasing you.
You know how I feel about you.

215
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,433
Yeah, you have a lousy way
of showing it.

216
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:07,856
I am trying to kiss
and make up here.

217
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:11,151
Now, won't you please
accept my apology?

218
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:14,237
Blow it out your ear.

219
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,033
All right, you diva dog,
but I'm in charge of this band,

220
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:20,410
and ain't no one's indispensable.

221
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,371
You're in charge?

222
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:27,709
- Which one of us is in the driver's seat?
- Now, listen, you...

223
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:31,087
Now you got me riled.

224
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:38,762
All right!

225
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:44,059
Yee-haw!
Ride 'em, cowboy, away!

226
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,521
Whoo-hoo!
Yee-haw!

227
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:51,399
All right!
This is the most fun ever!

228
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:54,944
- Second-most fun ever.
- Mr. Cash.

229
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,572
Kid, I saw how blissful
you looked singing.

230
00:19:57,614 --> 00:20:00,033
That had to be
the best time you ever had.

231
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,118
Oh, for sure.

232
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,954
Well, now, we can't let nothing
in the way of that.

233
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:16,383
Like I was saying,
how'd you like to join the band?

234
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:18,301
- Really? Huh?
- Yes, sir.

235
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:21,304
Genuine Singin' Stray.
What do you say?

236
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:22,681
Yeah!

237
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:25,600
Copper, we were gonna
have some more fun.

238
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:29,104
Well, Tod can be
in the band, too, right?

239
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,773
- Well, uh...
- He's my best friend.

240
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:33,358
Can you sing, kid?

241
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:37,278
- Uh...
- 'Course he can sing. Show him, Tod.

242
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:44,869
Whoa!

243
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:50,208
Hoo-hoo!
Here's the good news:

244
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,211
You're gonna be part
of the entourage-y.

245
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:55,255
- What's that?
- That's French.

246
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:58,174
Means you get to hang out with
our star here, keep him happy.

247
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,801
He does that already.

248
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:02,971
You know, fetch water, clean dog bowls -
fun stuff like that.

249
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:05,974
- That's fun?
- Does Granny have fleas?

250
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:08,393
Aw, come on, Todd.
It's gonna be great!

251
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:11,062
Well... OK.

252
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:13,356
All right, then.
Let's get moving.

253
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:19,988
Wasn't he amazing, the way
he ate fire, Mr. Bickerstaff?

254
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,323
Maybe you shouldn't
have stood so close.

255
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:26,077
Now you tell me.

256
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,332
- OK.
- Hey, Dixie.

257
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:36,588
- You come crawling back.
- Oh, by the way, you can't quit.

258
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:40,675
- You're fired.
- Oh! What? You can't fire me!

259
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:44,429
I already quit!
Cash, you... Oh!

260
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:47,932
Now you've got me riled.

261
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:51,853
Ohh!

262
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:57,650
Ah, don't get your collar
in a bunch, Dixie. Pitch a fur ball.

263
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:00,945
The nerve of that Cash!
Where's he get off firing me?

264
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:03,448
Oh, I thought you quit.

265
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:07,869
I'm that man's heart and soul!
It's plain as a pig on a sofa.

266
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:15,001
That Cash can talk a dog off a meat truck.
He talked me into getting sweet on him,

267
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:19,214
and now he tosses me away
like yesterday's cornbread!

268
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,883
Honey, I don't blame you
for feeling hurt.

269
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:25,929
Hurt? What do you mean by that?
You think Cash could hurt me?

270
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:36,147
Mangy mutt.

271
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:43,279
Oh, you'll howl real good
today, fellas.

272
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:47,867
Oh, well, there's more
than one way to skin a cat.

273
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:49,953
- Ahem.
- No offense.

274
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:54,457
Soup's on!
That's a good boy right there!

275
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:57,210
All right, fellas, all right.
Calling out the team.

276
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:05,010
You know, if I could just play the banjo
better, y'all would be eating steaks.

277
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:08,138
Hey! I guess I'd better go practice.

278
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:11,391
Welcome to the band, kid.
Let me do some introductions.

279
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:13,852
That there is Waylon and Floyd.

280
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:18,773
They're the, uh, brains of the outfit.

281
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:23,319
Oh, why I put up with this
low-class crew of mutts is beyond me.

282
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:28,283
Uh, and that delicate flower
is Granny Rose.

283
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,952
Textbook version of growing old gracefully.

284
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:32,495
I got me an itch.

285
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:37,959
Yep. You'll never harmonize
with a finer group of singing strays and...

286
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:41,588
Uh, you are a stray, right, boy?

287
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:47,135
- Uh...
- 'Course he's a stray.

288
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:49,262
You don't see a collar
around him, do ya?

289
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:51,181
- Well, that's true.
- I don't see one.

290
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:53,767
No collar, no home.

291
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:58,271
Whoo! Good.
Only strays allowed in this dog band.

292
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:02,150
- Tod, I'm not a stray.
- Shh!

293
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:04,277
It'll be our secret.

294
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:11,034
Ha-ha. Just wait till Copper sees this.

295
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:14,120
Another fourth-place ribbon.
Ha-ha.

296
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:17,165
Next year, we're going for the three-peat.

297
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:19,334
- Oh!
- What the...

298
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:21,544
- Widow Tweed.
- Hmm?

299
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:25,090
Oh! Do you make a career
out of getting in my way?

300
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:28,802
Step aside, woman.
I got a prize-winner coming through.

301
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:31,137
- Well, so do I.
- What?

302
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:34,724
This here's a hunting dog.
What could you do with a pie?

303
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,062
Uh... Oh, yeah. Oh.

304
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:45,777
Woman's got spunk.
I'll give her that. Hmph!

305
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:59,666
OK, fellas, ten minutes till curtain.
Let's round 'em up and move 'em out.

306
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:01,334
Move 'em, round 'em.

307
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:03,336
I'm movin'.

308
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,381
- That means you, Copper.
- Huh?

309
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:08,049
Whoa!

310
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:19,019
- Good luck, Copper.
- Thanks, entourage-y.

311
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:22,731
Say, Tod, while we're on, why don't you
spiff up those bowls a little bit?

312
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:26,818
The bowls? OK, Cash.

313
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:32,407
Don't forget - fireworks.
Smack at sundown.

314
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:34,534
It's a promise.

315
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:40,749
Psst! Little darling.

316
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:44,294
Come on in.
Dixie wants to talk to ya.

317
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:49,924
- But I'm supposed to sing now.
- Oh, I know, I know.

318
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:53,219
I just wanted to pass along
my secret of success.

319
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:55,764
Really? Thanks, Miss Dixie.

320
00:25:55,805 --> 00:26:00,518
Before every show,
take a big ol' helping of that.

321
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:04,189
Peanut butter?

322
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:07,233
All right, let's get
to growling and howling.

323
00:26:07,317 --> 00:26:10,153
Now... Granny Rose,
go fetch Copper, will you?

324
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:14,324
Ah, uh... Hang on.
Ooh, ah. Oh, that's good.

325
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:22,248
Uh-oh. Bad news in a rhinestone collar.

326
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:26,002
Oh, why, Cash, you look as
nervous as a long-tailed cat

327
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:27,837
in a room full of rocking chairs.

328
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:31,091
'Cause I'm busy as a farmer with
one hoe and two rattlesnakes.

329
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:35,845
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm as... as...
Oh, I got nothing.

330
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:37,806
- What is it, Dixie?
- Oh...

331
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:40,809
I just thought you could
use a lead singer.

332
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:56,991
Peanut butter?
But, Copper, you have to sing!

333
00:26:57,075 --> 00:27:01,413
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

334
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:10,797
Oh, hold on, Copper.
I'll be right back.

335
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:23,351
The winner of the milking
contest is the Widow Tweed

336
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:25,812
and her fine cow Abigail!

337
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:28,398
Ohh!

338
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:29,983
What?

339
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:41,828
Copper! Come on out!

340
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:43,955
Perfect! Just like that!

341
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:50,670
All right!

342
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:52,964
- Moo!
- Ha-ha-ha!

343
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:57,385
- You know darn well that Copper is...
- Copper? You mean that little pup?

344
00:27:57,427 --> 00:27:59,679
Why, he ran off
with that fox friend of his

345
00:27:59,763 --> 00:28:01,890
like a bank robber on roller skates.

346
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:04,476
- You're kidding.
- Hey, if I'm lying,

347
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,020
may my fur lose its natural luster.

348
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:09,064
That did it! I can sing!

349
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:11,441
Great. When you get out
there, don't forget to...

350
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:16,446
O-O-OK.
See you at the fireworks, right?

351
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:19,908
Get used to it... entourage.

352
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:26,289
- This is how it's gonna be from now on.
- What do you mean?

353
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:32,671
While he's off having fun and getting
the glory, he'll stick you with the chores.

354
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:35,006
No, Copper isn't like that.

355
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:39,052
Yeah.
Well, we'll see, won't we?

356
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,722
Here I am!
Ohh!

357
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:47,560
Huh. Ran off, huh?

358
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:49,145
Sorry, Dix.

359
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,565
Peanut butter?

360
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:55,777
Oh, Dixie.
You are through.

361
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:59,823
Well, getting rid of me
ain't gonna be so easy, Cash.

362
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:01,199
Whoa!

363
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:04,661
That looked easy.

364
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:07,580
Remind me to give that piece
of wood a bonus.

365
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:14,004
Look, Miss Farmer, this ain't the kind of
talent I'm a-looking for.

366
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:19,968
Yeah, you're right.
That flea circus was totally amateur hour.

367
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:23,263
Waylon, give me a back beat.

368
00:29:23,346 --> 00:29:25,807
We are headed for the big time,

369
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:29,978
and I got a big-time song to take us there.

370
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,189
Follow my lead, kid.

371
00:30:26,534 --> 00:30:29,287
Oh, he's just so darn cute.

372
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:35,502
Oh, Cash, I'm supposed
to meet Tod soon for the...

373
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:38,171
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We can't let nobody hold us back.

374
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:42,175
We're hound dudes, remember?

375
00:31:10,412 --> 00:31:13,707
Wow. Awesome.

376
00:31:31,891 --> 00:31:35,145
I've never been so high up in my life.

377
00:31:35,228 --> 00:31:37,939
I think I was higher
than the fireworks.

378
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:40,358
Yeah, and how about
those free hot dogs?

379
00:31:40,442 --> 00:31:44,279
You looked happier than a hog
at Sunday potluck.

380
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,489
All right.
Meet you backstage, kid.

381
00:31:46,573 --> 00:31:50,118
- We got a lot of work to do.
- You got it, Cash.

382
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:54,664
- Oh, sorry, Tod.
- Hey, Copper, how's the Ferris wheel?

383
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:59,127
The fireworks!
Oh, gosh, I forgot.

384
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:02,714
Cash and I were busier
than two mice in a cheese shop.

385
00:32:02,797 --> 00:32:06,718
- Too busy for your best friend?
- It's not like that, Tod.

386
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:08,720
Cash said I had
to let everyone see me.

387
00:32:08,803 --> 00:32:11,014
Cash said it's good
for the band. Cash said...

388
00:32:11,097 --> 00:32:16,394
"Cash said, Cash said."
Who cares about Cash?

389
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:20,774
Tod, what's wrong? Are you jealous?

390
00:32:20,857 --> 00:32:22,817
'Course not, you dumb dog.

391
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:25,862
- Then what's eating you?
- I don't know.

392
00:32:25,904 --> 00:32:28,740
It's like, you're not around anymore.

393
00:32:34,204 --> 00:32:38,708
Well, I'm around now. Let's do something.

394
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:41,378
I mean, if you wanna.

395
00:32:41,461 --> 00:32:43,004
Now?

396
00:32:43,088 --> 00:32:46,049
- Shake on it?
- Shake on it.

397
00:32:46,091 --> 00:32:51,513
Kid, I swear you're slow as an iron toad.
Come on, you're holding us up. Let's go.

398
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:55,183
Waylon, would you get up? We got more
ground to cover than the Pony Express.

399
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:57,394
Now, let's get to work, hounds!

400
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:05,235
- I guess I gotta go.
- But... but, Copper...

401
00:33:05,318 --> 00:33:08,405
I'll see you later, OK?

402
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:20,625
Yeah? Well, maybe you will
and maybe you won't!

403
00:33:35,682 --> 00:33:40,020
Why eat 'em, Dix? Might as well
just slap 'em right on your hips.

404
00:33:41,646 --> 00:33:44,149
Come on, Zelda. I need a drink.

405
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:56,745
Give me one straight.

406
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:02,083
Give me that.

407
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:12,093
Oh, darling. You look like
something the cat dragged in.

408
00:34:12,177 --> 00:34:14,888
- Ahem.
- Oh, no offense.

409
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:20,226
- What do you care?
- Oh, come on, Tod.

410
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:23,980
We're both
in the same old briar patch now.

411
00:34:24,064 --> 00:34:28,234
Cast off by the one we care about the most.

412
00:34:29,694 --> 00:34:32,530
Guess you know how that feels now.

413
00:34:32,614 --> 00:34:35,575
- Copper's forgotten all about me.
- Yeah.

414
00:34:35,658 --> 00:34:39,454
- I heard that. Hurts worse than anything.
- Yeah.

415
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:42,290
I remember this one tom cat
named Leroy...

416
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:45,043
I'm talking to the fox.

417
00:34:55,637 --> 00:35:00,600
You see, Tod, relationships
and show business, they just don't mix.

418
00:35:00,684 --> 00:35:03,478
Oh, it starts out nice and friendly.

419
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,400
Then they get that first taste of fame,
and it's "look out for number one."

420
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:06,041
All right, let's get to crooning.

421
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:26,353
Cold noses.

422
00:37:43,346 --> 00:37:46,933
Not even a little-bitty bone.

423
00:37:57,861 --> 00:38:01,781
Now, that's a good little doggie.

424
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:05,618
And you know what?
He wouldn't even be in that dumb old band

425
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:08,121
if I hadn't lied for him.

426
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:12,334
- Come again?
- I got Cash to think he was a stray.

427
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:16,463
Copper's no stray.
He lives just down the road apiece.

428
00:38:16,546 --> 00:38:19,966
Well, darling, all our troubles are over.

429
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:22,927
How'd you like
to get your best friend back?

430
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:25,221
- But how?
- Heh-heh-heh.

431
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:29,184
Just listen close to old Dixie here.

432
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:48,495
Whoa, whoa. That last note was flatter
than a duck's footprint.

433
00:38:48,578 --> 00:38:50,830
Take it from the top, please.

434
00:38:50,914 --> 00:38:54,334
Oh, but, Cash, we've been at it all night.

435
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:57,420
And we'll be at it all day
if that's what it takes.

436
00:38:57,504 --> 00:39:00,090
This ain't just another show.

437
00:39:00,173 --> 00:39:04,094
The scout from the Grand Old Opry
is gonna be watching.

438
00:39:05,178 --> 00:39:07,180
Take it from the top.

439
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,976
Copper. Just what are you doing?

440
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:15,980
Well, it's a cricket. Me and Tod used to...

441
00:39:16,064 --> 00:39:19,192
What is the matter with you, kid?
Don't you wanna be a star?

442
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:21,903
- Well... sure.
- Well, then, why don't you...

443
00:39:21,986 --> 00:39:24,489
Cash. He's just a pup.

444
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:31,705
Copper's just having a little fun.
You do remember fun, don't you?

445
00:39:33,915 --> 00:39:36,334
OK. All right.

446
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:39,754
Just take five, everyone.

447
00:39:40,422 --> 00:39:43,091
Sweetie pie, don't take it to heart.

448
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:45,677
Cash's bark is worse than his bite.

449
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,973
And if he growls at us again,
I'm gonna muzzle him myself.

450
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:06,239
Tod?

451
00:40:09,826 --> 00:40:12,078
Tod.

452
00:40:13,496 --> 00:40:15,790
You in there?

453
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:30,555
Cash, you have seen Tod?

454
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:34,017
Nope. Dixie ain't around neither.

455
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:37,854
You were looking for her?

456
00:40:37,937 --> 00:40:39,481
No.

457
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:43,193
Well...

458
00:40:44,861 --> 00:40:47,155
I remember when I first met her.

459
00:40:47,238 --> 00:40:51,201
I was just a little old stray like you,
all paws and ears,

460
00:40:51,284 --> 00:40:53,453
and felt like a real good-for-nothing.

461
00:40:53,536 --> 00:40:55,330
- You?
- Yeah.

462
00:40:55,413 --> 00:41:00,669
And then one night, we went a-howling
at the moon, and I found out we could sing.

463
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:07,050
I said, "Dixie, this is our ticket to success.
We are gonna be stars."

464
00:41:08,885 --> 00:41:14,808
I guess I'd be stretching it
if I said I didn't want her around sometimes.

465
00:41:14,891 --> 00:41:17,352
But we're a couple of hound dudes now,
remember?

466
00:41:17,394 --> 00:41:21,523
We can't let old friends get
in the way of that, right?

467
00:41:21,606 --> 00:41:25,360
- I guess not.
- Oh, come on. You're having fun, ain't ya?

468
00:41:25,443 --> 00:41:27,654
Ha! Are you kidding?

469
00:41:27,737 --> 00:41:32,409
Well, you just wait till we're on top.
We are so close, I can smell it.

470
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:35,870
The Grand Old Opry.

471
00:41:35,912 --> 00:41:39,040
All we gotta do is ace that audition.

472
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:41,835
- Right?
- Heh-heh-heh. Right.

473
00:41:45,505 --> 00:41:49,426
- Come on. Let's go rehearse some more.
- Attaboy.

474
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,472
Copper!

475
00:41:55,598 --> 00:41:57,434
Copper!

476
00:41:57,517 --> 00:42:01,521
Oh, where could that pup
have gotten off to?

477
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:04,482
Copper!

478
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:13,908
Tod! Oh, Tod!

479
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:16,661
Widow, what are you doing up
this time of night?

480
00:42:16,745 --> 00:42:22,167
Oh, I can't find my Tod anywhere.
That pup of yours probably chased him off.

481
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:25,337
I wouldn't know. I can't find him.

482
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,589
Oh...

483
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:32,761
Well, if I see a sign of your puppy,
I'll give you a holler.

484
00:42:32,802 --> 00:42:40,101
I'm obliged. If I see hide or hair
of that fox of yours, well...

485
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:44,773
Thank you, Amos.

486
00:42:45,899 --> 00:42:47,275
Tod!

487
00:42:47,776 --> 00:42:49,402
Tod!

488
00:42:49,486 --> 00:42:51,696
Oh, Tod.

489
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,698
Copper!

490
00:42:53,782 --> 00:42:55,575
Tod!

491
00:43:05,126 --> 00:43:07,212
Oh, my hair.

492
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:09,422
Hmph!

493
00:43:12,175 --> 00:43:13,134
Ugh.

494
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,762
Broke a nail...

495
00:43:17,847 --> 00:43:22,352
- That's where Copper lives.
- Nice spread. Could use woman's touch.

496
00:43:23,103 --> 00:43:25,605
You sure this is a good idea?

497
00:43:25,689 --> 00:43:31,403
It's the only way. When Clem Clod-kicker
over there gets to the fair and sees Copper,

498
00:43:31,486 --> 00:43:35,240
he'll bring him home for sure.
You two will get to be friends again,

499
00:43:35,323 --> 00:43:38,910
and I will reclaim my rightful place
in the spotlight.

500
00:43:38,993 --> 00:43:43,164
Hmm. We just gotta figure out
how to get them to follow us.

501
00:43:43,206 --> 00:43:44,207
Heh-heh.

502
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:47,794
That's the easy part.
See, old Chief there hates me,

503
00:43:47,877 --> 00:43:53,341
but he couldn't catch a cold in winter,
and wherever Chief goes, Slade follows.

504
00:43:53,466 --> 00:43:56,386
Well, let's see your stuff there, cowboy.

505
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:06,021
Psst! Chief!

506
00:44:09,274 --> 00:44:10,984
Chief!

507
00:44:21,494 --> 00:44:23,496
Oh, that tickles.

508
00:44:27,625 --> 00:44:29,669
Huh?

509
00:44:33,715 --> 00:44:34,758
Wha...

510
00:44:34,841 --> 00:44:37,177
- Oh!
- Ooh, ooh.

511
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:41,306
Snuggly-wuggly little pookie-pooh.

512
00:44:42,766 --> 00:44:44,684
Yow!

513
00:44:50,273 --> 00:44:52,859
Chief, what the devil...

514
00:45:01,701 --> 00:45:03,912
- Tod!
- Eh!

515
00:45:03,953 --> 00:45:06,539
It's that darn critter of yours!

516
00:45:06,623 --> 00:45:09,793
My critter? It's your hunt...
Oh, my! Oh, dear!

517
00:45:09,876 --> 00:45:12,379
When I get my hands on you...

518
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:17,133
Tod, I'm coming!

519
00:45:21,638 --> 00:45:24,182
I gotcha in my sight!

520
00:45:25,308 --> 00:45:27,727
You can't get away from me!

521
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:31,564
I'm a fourth-place winner two times over.

522
00:45:31,648 --> 00:45:34,067
Why, you! Come back here!

523
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:36,945
Ah, Chief, come back!

524
00:45:44,494 --> 00:45:46,621
Testing. Testing.

525
00:45:46,663 --> 00:45:51,042
Why, Cash, look at you.
You're nervous as a flea on dip day.

526
00:45:51,126 --> 00:45:56,047
- I haven't seen you like this in a long time.
- You ain't never seen me like this, Granny.

527
00:45:56,131 --> 00:45:59,467
I just hope that talent scout fella's
in a good mood.

528
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:05,265
You know, that snake charmer could use
a little more practice. Don't you think?

529
00:46:05,348 --> 00:46:07,017
Aah!

530
00:46:22,323 --> 00:46:25,035
Oh! Hey! Hey! Aah!

531
00:46:34,711 --> 00:46:37,339
Get the lead out of them boots,
Mr. Bickerstaff.

532
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,841
The talent show's just about to start.

533
00:46:39,924 --> 00:46:42,510
Aah!

534
00:46:42,594 --> 00:46:44,929
I know. I'm excited too.

535
00:46:45,597 --> 00:46:49,351
Whoa, whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Ugh! Ugh!

536
00:47:11,706 --> 00:47:15,168
- Mm! Blueberries.
- Oink!

537
00:47:29,516 --> 00:47:30,767
Aah!

538
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:34,604
Aah!

539
00:47:37,524 --> 00:47:41,027
Here we are, Mr. Bickerstaff.
Just in time.

540
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:45,240
Ladies and gentlemen, The Singin' Strays!

541
00:47:49,703 --> 00:47:52,580
Coming through! Excuse me! Pardon me!

542
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:55,417
- Tod?
- Copper?

543
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,960
- Chief!
- Tod!

544
00:47:57,043 --> 00:47:59,212
Copper! That's my dog!

545
00:47:59,295 --> 00:48:02,257
You ain't a stray?

546
00:48:02,841 --> 00:48:03,842
Aah!

547
00:48:05,135 --> 00:48:06,511
Aah!

548
00:48:06,594 --> 00:48:08,555
What in tarnation?

549
00:48:19,149 --> 00:48:21,651
Dixie, what have you done?

550
00:48:22,277 --> 00:48:26,948
Where they going? Wait. We can't let'em
leave. We got a show to do. Wait!

551
00:48:33,997 --> 00:48:37,792
That's it! I can't take anymore.

552
00:48:37,834 --> 00:48:40,628
I don't book no circuses!

553
00:48:57,687 --> 00:49:00,148
Why, thank you, little lady.

554
00:49:01,941 --> 00:49:04,944
- You've been so kind.
- Drive careful.

555
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:10,950
Bye, Mr. Bickerstaff. See ya next year!

556
00:49:11,034 --> 00:49:12,994
Ohh!

557
00:49:16,539 --> 00:49:18,750
What are we gonna do now, Cash?

558
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:21,294
You're gonna go home.

559
00:49:21,378 --> 00:49:24,464
- But the band...
- Don't you get it?

560
00:49:24,547 --> 00:49:26,675
You're fired!

561
00:49:31,971 --> 00:49:36,768
You know what? You used to be
a lot more fun to be around.

562
00:49:36,851 --> 00:49:39,771
Oh, now, come on. Where are you going?

563
00:49:39,854 --> 00:49:42,065
Hey!

564
00:49:42,148 --> 00:49:46,277
Oh, yeah? Fine! We don't need you, either.
Right, boys?

565
00:49:48,196 --> 00:49:53,368
- Sorry, Cash.
- It just ain't no fun anymore.

566
00:49:54,869 --> 00:49:58,665
Why does it always rain
when things go wrong?

567
00:49:58,748 --> 00:50:01,668
I don't know, Floyd.

568
00:50:09,592 --> 00:50:11,594
Happy now?

569
00:50:18,601 --> 00:50:22,272
Copper, I'm sorry. I just wanted to...

570
00:50:22,355 --> 00:50:25,233
You ruined everything!

571
00:50:26,109 --> 00:50:28,111
Copper!

572
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,242
Attaboy.

573
00:50:36,036 --> 00:50:38,496
Let's get outta here.

574
00:50:43,793 --> 00:50:47,589
Oh, Tod. There, there, now.

575
00:51:25,001 --> 00:51:26,461
Oh! Oh!

576
00:52:29,315 --> 00:52:31,735
Copper?

577
00:52:31,818 --> 00:52:33,570
Dixie?

578
00:52:33,653 --> 00:52:36,239
What are you doing here?

579
00:52:38,408 --> 00:52:43,121
I just thought you should know
that blowing your cover was my idea.

580
00:52:43,204 --> 00:52:45,790
Not Tod's.

581
00:52:45,874 --> 00:52:50,587
I guess I just lost sight
of what's really important.

582
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:53,840
And, darling, I'm awful sorry.

583
00:52:53,923 --> 00:52:57,344
He never wanted to hurt you.

584
00:52:57,427 --> 00:53:00,263
He just wanted you to be his friend again.

585
00:53:03,641 --> 00:53:07,562
Well, that's what I came to say.

586
00:53:34,214 --> 00:53:35,340
Copper?

587
00:53:37,634 --> 00:53:40,178
- Hi.
- Hi.

588
00:53:40,845 --> 00:53:45,392
- Are we still friends?
- I don't know. Aren't you all mad?

589
00:53:45,975 --> 00:53:48,812
Well, I've been thinking,

590
00:53:48,895 --> 00:53:51,481
I've been kind of a cabbage head.

591
00:53:51,564 --> 00:53:55,318
If that ain't right, grits ain't groceries.

592
00:53:55,402 --> 00:53:59,906
Well, anyway, I sure am sorry.

593
00:53:59,989 --> 00:54:03,660
Yeah, and I'm sorry too.

594
00:54:03,743 --> 00:54:07,247
Hey! I just got a great idea. Hang on.

595
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:09,749
Got something for you.

596
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:13,086
Thanks, but I didn't get you anything.

597
00:54:13,128 --> 00:54:18,800
No, no. It belongs to the talent scout.
I figure you could use it to find him.

598
00:54:18,883 --> 00:54:22,262
You know, if you still want that audition.

599
00:54:22,345 --> 00:54:25,557
- How?
- You're a real hunting dog, aren't you?

600
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,143
And this here hat is his address.

601
00:54:31,521 --> 00:54:34,441
Yeah, that's it. Get a good whiff.

602
00:54:35,859 --> 00:54:39,863
OK, you get the scout,
and I'll go get the band.

603
00:54:43,366 --> 00:54:46,286
Lyle, you fool. There's your problem.

604
00:54:46,369 --> 00:54:49,414
The doohickey is coming out
of the whatchamacallit

605
00:54:49,497 --> 00:54:51,541
and leaking all over the hoozanozzle.

606
00:54:51,624 --> 00:54:54,294
Cash! Cash!

607
00:54:54,377 --> 00:54:56,796
- Dixie's in trouble!
- What's happened?

608
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,883
What's wrong?

609
00:54:59,966 --> 00:55:01,968
Sit!

610
00:55:02,635 --> 00:55:04,971
- Where is she?
- Follow me.

611
00:55:06,389 --> 00:55:10,977
All right, that'll do it.
All right, fellas. We are off to...

612
00:55:11,061 --> 00:55:12,187
Uh...

613
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:14,314
fellas?

614
00:55:14,397 --> 00:55:16,483
Waylon? Cash?

615
00:55:17,942 --> 00:55:19,110
Anybody?

616
00:55:24,866 --> 00:55:25,950
Huh?

617
00:55:34,918 --> 00:55:36,795
Doh!

618
00:55:43,426 --> 00:55:44,719
Huh? Huh?

619
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:50,308
- Well, where is she?
- Uh...

620
00:55:50,392 --> 00:55:51,685
Um...

621
00:55:51,768 --> 00:55:53,520
Huh?

622
00:55:56,564 --> 00:55:58,024
Thataway!

623
00:55:58,108 --> 00:56:00,318
Come on, everyone! Follow me!

624
00:56:16,251 --> 00:56:18,211
Copper, where's Dixie?

625
00:56:18,294 --> 00:56:20,422
She'll be along.

626
00:56:20,505 --> 00:56:22,549
Cash!

627
00:56:22,632 --> 00:56:24,592
Way to go, Copper!

628
00:56:24,676 --> 00:56:27,554
- Cash, are you all right?
- No, no, are you all right? I'm...

629
00:56:27,637 --> 00:56:29,597
I'm fine.

630
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:33,727
What in tarnation...
I thought you were in trouble.

631
00:56:37,564 --> 00:56:41,276
Just exactly why did you get us
all together?

632
00:56:42,277 --> 00:56:45,113
'Cause... 'cause...

633
00:56:45,196 --> 00:56:47,824
'Cause that's how it oughta be.

634
00:56:47,907 --> 00:56:49,909
Like the words in the song.

635
00:56:49,993 --> 00:56:55,790
Like the sun and blue skies. Um...

636
00:56:55,874 --> 00:56:59,544
Like summer nights. And fireflies.

637
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:03,882
- Like an itch.
- And a scratch.

638
00:57:06,051 --> 00:57:09,846
Well, ain't somebody gonna sing?

639
00:58:15,412 --> 00:58:17,497
Gosh, I missed you.

640
00:58:49,404 --> 00:58:54,242
Ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

641
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:56,619
Whoo-hoo!

642
00:58:56,703 --> 00:59:01,791
Well, bravo! I finally found my act!

643
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:03,376
Yahoo!

644
00:59:03,418 --> 00:59:06,463
You all gonna be stars!

645
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:12,052
Whoo-whoo!

646
00:59:15,013 --> 00:59:17,015
There you fellas are!

647
00:59:17,098 --> 00:59:21,269
- Are these here talented canines yours?
- Yes, yes, sir.

648
00:59:21,353 --> 00:59:23,980
We've got to talk.
Come over here, son.

649
00:59:24,064 --> 00:59:28,151
Well, there you go, Cash.
You just got what you always wanted.

650
00:59:28,234 --> 00:59:31,196
Well, maybe I had it all along.

651
00:59:31,279 --> 00:59:34,824
- Well, what are you saying?
- Well, what do you think I'm saying?

652
00:59:34,908 --> 00:59:38,620
Well, you'd better be saying
what I think you're saying.

653
00:59:38,703 --> 00:59:41,998
I think you know what I'm saying is
what you think I'm saying.

654
00:59:42,082 --> 00:59:46,670
Well, I thought you'd never ask.

655
00:59:48,004 --> 00:59:51,007
Now, there's the good news.

656
00:59:51,091 --> 00:59:53,635
Somebody smack me.
I must be dreaming.

657
00:59:53,718 --> 00:59:57,138
We got a little old barn called the Grand
Old Opry I'd kinda like to show you.

658
00:59:57,180 --> 01:00:02,268
Yes, yes, sir. That sounds great.
That would be fantastic.

659
01:00:05,355 --> 01:00:07,273
Tod!

660
01:00:11,736 --> 01:00:13,530
- Tod!
- Huh?

661
01:00:13,613 --> 01:00:15,448
Tod!

662
01:00:17,117 --> 01:00:19,244
Copper?

663
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:22,539
But the band... Aren't you doing with them?

664
01:00:22,622 --> 01:00:26,793
Can't.
You and me... we got crickets to chase.

665
01:00:28,586 --> 01:00:33,842
And if I ever forget that again,
you just kick me in my walkin'-awayin'.

666
01:00:33,883 --> 01:00:37,095
- Shake on it?
- Shake on it.

667
01:01:17,635 --> 01:01:18,887
Hey!

668
01:01:53,046 --> 01:01:55,173
Aah!

669
01:01:58,635 --> 01:02:00,261
Huh?

670
01:02:01,638 --> 01:02:04,599
- Oh!
- Wait for me!
