1
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:55,348
-Check, please.
- Look, Daddy, a volcano.

2
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,754
That's very pretty. Drink up your volcano.

3
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:01,818
- All right, we're going. Mummy's waiting.
- Just one more minute?

4
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:04,658
- We're going.
- No.

5
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:06,029
- Yes.
- No.

6
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,499
Yes.

7
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,195
No.

8
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:13,898
Until I ended up flatlining at the hospital.

9
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:19,043
But I survived and, instead of letting that scare me,
I kept on going.

10
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:24,614
Until my first daughter was born.

11
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,623
And now, I look at my girls

12
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:33,752
And my husband,

13
00:01:33,795 --> 00:01:38,255
Who has been standing by me for so long...

14
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,095
Think which one you're gonna pull out.

15
00:01:44,139 --> 00:01:46,107
- I always think, man.
- No, you don't.

16
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:49,235
They didn't lock you up because you're not 1 8.

17
00:01:49,278 --> 00:01:52,679
Next time, they're going to lock you up, brother.

18
00:01:52,714 --> 00:01:54,375
Come on.

19
00:02:03,692 --> 00:02:05,683
You're not thinking.

20
00:02:05,727 --> 00:02:09,528
Stealing might get you money,
get to tap some cheerleader's ass,

21
00:02:09,566 --> 00:02:12,535
Show off riding some pickle-colored Thunderbird.

22
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,336
But what's gonna happen if you shoot
a pregnant woman or an old man?

23
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:23,502
You know what will happen?

24
00:02:24,214 --> 00:02:26,648
The guilt will suck you down to the bone.

25
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,261
Stealing ain't worth it.

26
00:02:41,298 --> 00:02:45,928
Going to church, reading the Bible
and believing in Jesus, brother -

27
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,665
That's your ticket.

28
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,707
Yeah.

29
00:02:54,378 --> 00:02:56,870
Think it's a fantasy, right?

30
00:02:57,749 --> 00:02:59,774
Huh?

31
00:03:01,653 --> 00:03:04,486
Come here, man. Get up, come here.

32
00:03:11,463 --> 00:03:14,364
- See that truck? Beauty, ain't it?

33
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:17,163
- I won it at a friend's raffle.
- No shit.

34
00:03:17,202 --> 00:03:22,573
You know what? It wasn't luck.
It was Jesus who wanted me to have that truck.

35
00:03:22,608 --> 00:03:24,940
Bullshit. I bet you stole it.

36
00:03:26,412 --> 00:03:28,812
Jesus gave me that truck.

37
00:03:30,383 --> 00:03:33,978
And it's He who gives and He who takes away.

38
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,786
- Yeah, right. He doesn't give a shit about us.
- Come back.

39
00:03:37,823 --> 00:03:39,814
Come back!

40
00:03:44,463 --> 00:03:46,455
Take off the hat.

41
00:03:46,967 --> 00:03:49,094
Take off that hat.

42
00:03:51,972 --> 00:03:55,066
God even knows
when a single hair moves on your head.

43
00:03:58,345 --> 00:04:00,336
You're wrong, Nick.

44
00:04:26,341 --> 00:04:30,300
'So, this is death's waiting room.

45
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,277
'These ridiculous tubes.

46
00:04:36,618 --> 00:04:39,485
'These needles swelling my arms.

47
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,957
'What am I doing in this pre-corpse club?

48
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:51,899
'What do I have to do with them?

49
00:04:56,271 --> 00:04:59,297
'l don't know when anything began anymore.

50
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,308
'Or when it's gonna end.

51
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:08,082
'Who will be the first to lose his life?

52
00:05:10,587 --> 00:05:13,454
'He, in the coma?

53
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:21,520
'Or me?'

54
00:06:04,342 --> 00:06:07,778
All right. You can get dressed now.

55
00:06:07,813 --> 00:06:11,340
Your fallopian tubes are severely damaged.

56
00:06:11,383 --> 00:06:14,945
It, er, looks like you had some kind of infection

57
00:06:14,987 --> 00:06:17,979
That wasn't taken care of properly.

58
00:06:18,024 --> 00:06:23,587
We can try surgery but I have to tell you,
I think the probabilities are pretty slim.

59
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:27,697
Look,

60
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:32,432
Excuse me for asking this
but it's important that you tell me the truth.

61
00:06:32,472 --> 00:06:34,906
Have you ever had an abortion?

62
00:06:41,648 --> 00:06:44,515
- Yes.
- Any reason?

63
00:06:46,386 --> 00:06:50,516
I had already separated from my husband
when I got pregnant...

64
00:06:50,557 --> 00:06:52,991
No, I meant medical reason.

65
00:06:56,697 --> 00:06:59,860
- My husband's dying.
- I'm sorry?

66
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,061
Paul, my husband, he's dying.

67
00:07:02,102 --> 00:07:04,333
And I want to have his baby.

68
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,675
We can operate then and hope you get pregnant
within three or four months.

69
00:07:13,615 --> 00:07:16,880
He's got one month left, at most.

70
00:07:22,157 --> 00:07:24,557
- How did it go?
- Not good, Reverend.

71
00:07:24,592 --> 00:07:28,256
- In one ear and out the other.
- Be patient.

72
00:07:28,297 --> 00:07:34,065
- All it takes is one sheep in 1,000, Jack.
- Wolf, you still having that party Wednesday?

73
00:07:34,103 --> 00:07:36,128
- My place, brother.
- Cool.

74
00:07:38,174 --> 00:07:40,642
I may be late. I have Bible class Wednesday.

75
00:07:40,676 --> 00:07:43,270
- Let it go.
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

76
00:07:43,312 --> 00:07:45,610
- Here, hold this.
-

77
00:07:45,648 --> 00:07:47,616
- I will hurt you, boy!
- Paul.

78
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,380
-.. Motherfucking dead!
- Back off. Back.

79
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:53,082
- I told you to think.
- Fuck you.

80
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,985
Hit me. Hit me. Hit me, eh?

81
00:07:57,027 --> 00:07:59,791
Jack! Jack! Jack! Hey! Hey!

82
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:01,797
Come on, come on.

83
00:08:02,132 --> 00:08:04,396
Leave it, Jack.

84
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,199
He's a kid, Jack.

85
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,603
- He's a punk, Reverend.
- No, he's a kid.

86
00:08:11,274 --> 00:08:13,606
You think, Jack. You think.

87
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,588
'For those who are
making decisions that affect our life

88
00:08:26,624 --> 00:08:29,787
'we must call out to God
to give them His wisdom...'

89
00:08:29,827 --> 00:08:34,890
Daddy's home. I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll pick the boys up after school if you want.

90
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,128
-
- Daddy!

91
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:39,466
Hello.

92
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:43,471
How's my queen?

93
00:08:44,042 --> 00:08:46,476
- And Hercules?
- You don't have a queen.

94
00:08:46,511 --> 00:08:49,878
Help me. I got the cooler from the religious center.

95
00:08:49,915 --> 00:08:53,544
- Are we gonna go buy a dog now?
- We agreed, no dogs.

96
00:08:53,585 --> 00:08:57,146
- You said if I got good grades...
- We've been through this,

97
00:08:57,189 --> 00:09:02,286
- dog hair is bad for your sister's allergies.
- It's not bad for me. Get me a dog.

98
00:09:02,327 --> 00:09:06,320
- Freddy, leave it alone.
- At least get me a hamster.

99
00:09:06,866 --> 00:09:11,530
- We'll see.
- We'll see? You always say you promise.

100
00:09:38,532 --> 00:09:41,933
Hey, Wolf! Are you back, motherfucker?

101
00:09:41,969 --> 00:09:44,062
Lock down six!

102
00:09:45,973 --> 00:09:48,203
Six down!

103
00:10:07,095 --> 00:10:09,563
- I win.
- Age before beauty.

104
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:12,762
Such a sore loser.

105
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:23,236
- Do you want to go to the Jacuzzi for a while?
- I can't.

106
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,612
- Michael and the girls are waiting for me.
- OK.

107
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,875
- Call me later.
- I'll call you.

108
00:10:32,355 --> 00:10:34,050
Cristina?

109
00:10:36,692 --> 00:10:41,686
If you get away from leading your family
like a man of God ought to lead his family -

110
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:44,757
In prayer and reading the word of God

111
00:10:45,234 --> 00:10:49,001
And the things of God
and bringing them to the house of God -

112
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:52,805
Then you're opening a door for the devil to come in
and slay your family.

113
00:10:52,843 --> 00:10:54,242
Amen.

114
00:10:54,277 --> 00:10:56,939
- Jesus is our light.
- Jesus is our light.

115
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,642
- Jesus is our hope.
- Jesus is our hope.

116
00:10:59,683 --> 00:11:03,380
- Jesus is our forgiveness.
- Jesus is our forgiveness.

117
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:09,188
- Jesus is the water that quenches my thirst.
- Jesus is the water that quenches my thirst.

118
00:11:09,226 --> 00:11:13,391
- If you're saved and you know it, say amen.
- Amen!

119
00:11:13,431 --> 00:11:15,729
Everybody up on your feet!

120
00:11:17,368 --> 00:11:20,826
- Jesus is our light.
- Jesus is our light.

121
00:13:02,611 --> 00:13:05,307
-
- Hey, honey, I'm home.

122
00:13:26,903 --> 00:13:29,371
- Hi.
- Jesus, you scared me.

123
00:13:29,405 --> 00:13:31,236
How are you feeling?

124
00:13:31,274 --> 00:13:34,334
- I feel great.
- Have you been smoking again?

125
00:13:35,711 --> 00:13:37,838
For fuck's sake, Paul.

126
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:41,943
If they find out they'll take you off the transplant list.

127
00:13:41,985 --> 00:13:44,180
If I don't smoke I go fucking nuts.

128
00:13:44,221 --> 00:13:46,052
Better nuts than dead.

129
00:13:47,257 --> 00:13:49,225
Not necessarily.

130
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:51,659
I don't know how the hell you get them.

131
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:58,362
Baby, baby...

132
00:13:58,402 --> 00:14:02,236
Baby, baby.

133
00:14:02,272 --> 00:14:06,972
Oh, God! Call an ambulance.

134
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,473
Call a fucking ambulance!

135
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:14,615
Goddamnit.

136
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,713
Please do something.

137
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,631
Come on. Please.

138
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,905
- Whoops.
- Can you handle your clubs?

139
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:12,935
Jack, the boss wants to talk to you.
Wants to see you now.

140
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:17,214
Come on, we both know I'm not a caddy yet.

141
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,881
But I'm working at it. And I'm learning, Brown.

142
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:28,028
- I swear to God, I'm not going to let you down.
- That's not the problem.

143
00:15:28,963 --> 00:15:33,366
- What's the problem?
- There have been complaints about your tattoos.

144
00:15:33,401 --> 00:15:38,771
- I got a long-sleeved shirt.
- No shirt gonna cover the one on your neck.

145
00:15:38,806 --> 00:15:41,297
Or are you gonna start wearing a scarf?

146
00:15:45,514 --> 00:15:48,142
This club is for people different from me and you...

147
00:15:48,183 --> 00:15:51,448
No, no, no. You know, I don't drink, I don't steal.

148
00:15:51,486 --> 00:15:56,150
- I'm clean. Tell me, why me?
- I know you're clean, that's why I hired you.

149
00:15:56,191 --> 00:15:58,955
But this decision is from the administration

150
00:15:58,994 --> 00:16:03,055
And if I don't follow through with it,
they're gonna fuck me too.

151
00:16:07,336 --> 00:16:12,603
I cut you a hefty severance check,
you can pick it up on the way to the cashier's.

152
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:14,976
Try to understand.

153
00:16:51,482 --> 00:16:55,475
OK, good. So, is there any pain?

154
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,116
- My head hurts a bit.
- That's the blood pressure medicine.

155
00:17:00,158 --> 00:17:03,924
- We'll get you something to make you feel better.
- Thank you.

156
00:17:03,962 --> 00:17:06,988
I brought what you asked for.

157
00:17:07,031 --> 00:17:09,329
Oh, my God.

158
00:17:11,436 --> 00:17:13,529
Oh!

159
00:17:13,571 --> 00:17:15,903
Is that my heart?

160
00:17:22,214 --> 00:17:24,205
The culprit.

161
00:17:41,133 --> 00:17:43,363
Which one is he?

162
00:17:45,638 --> 00:17:47,869
That's him with the brown vest.

163
00:17:47,908 --> 00:17:50,433
He's putting the bag up on the top right now.

164
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,451
You OK?

165
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,569
I want to kill him.

166
00:18:25,613 --> 00:18:27,945
We have to kill him.

167
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:36,523
Thank you Lord for keeping us together,
for filling us with love

168
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:39,118
And for giving us this meal. Amen.

169
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:40,924
- Amen.
- Amen.

170
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,203
I got fired from the club today.

171
00:18:55,143 --> 00:18:59,671
- Cos of your good pal Brown, right?
- He had nothing to do with it.

172
00:18:59,715 --> 00:19:02,685
- You believe that, Jack?
- Yes, I do.

173
00:19:04,053 --> 00:19:06,647
- Freddy, stop it.
- He hit me in the arm.

174
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:09,385
- Which arm, baby?
- This one.

175
00:19:09,425 --> 00:19:12,519
Hold out your other arm
and let your brother hit you.

176
00:19:15,565 --> 00:19:17,328
- Give me that.
- Jack, no!

177
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:18,994
Hold it out.

178
00:19:19,469 --> 00:19:22,267
"Whoever slaps you on the right cheek,

179
00:19:22,305 --> 00:19:24,900
"turn the other to him also."

180
00:19:26,577 --> 00:19:28,977
- Hit her. Don't be afraid.
- Jack!

181
00:19:29,013 --> 00:19:30,981
Hit her!

182
00:19:34,585 --> 00:19:37,679
Isn't that great? Wonderful. Great parenting.

183
00:19:37,721 --> 00:19:39,848
Good job. It's OK.

184
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,256
He didn't hurt her.

185
00:19:57,108 --> 00:19:59,599
There's no hitting in this house.

186
00:19:59,644 --> 00:20:02,738
You understand? Get in the corner.

187
00:20:13,658 --> 00:20:18,596
- Do I put the chocolate chips in now, Mommy?
- That's right, and then stir.

188
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:22,663
Stir real quick.

189
00:20:22,702 --> 00:20:25,034
Laura, put that back. Come on.

190
00:20:25,805 --> 00:20:29,002
- When's Daddy coming?
- Soon. Let's get this finished.

191
00:20:30,743 --> 00:20:32,233
Mm.

192
00:20:32,745 --> 00:20:34,076
Mm!

193
00:20:34,113 --> 00:20:38,447
-
- No, Laura, stop it now.

194
00:20:38,884 --> 00:20:41,217
Ask Lupe to stay next Friday.

195
00:20:41,254 --> 00:20:44,621
I've invited the company managers over for dinner.

196
00:20:44,658 --> 00:20:46,819
I fired her.

197
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,454
You fired her? Why?

198
00:20:51,231 --> 00:20:53,597
She made me feel like a cripple.

199
00:20:53,633 --> 00:20:55,897
Goddamnit, Paul.

200
00:20:56,403 --> 00:20:58,701
So now who's going to cook for you?

201
00:20:58,739 --> 00:21:02,368
Who's going to clean up after you,
take care of you? Who?

202
00:21:02,409 --> 00:21:05,902
- I can do it for myself.
- Oh, you can do it by yourself?

203
00:21:07,882 --> 00:21:10,180
I can't do it anymore, Paul.

204
00:21:10,218 --> 00:21:12,345
Really, I can't.

205
00:21:30,139 --> 00:21:35,372
- What are you doing?
- I'm just... What does it feel like I'm doing?

206
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:39,078
- Don't. You might hurt yourself.
- I won't.

207
00:21:39,114 --> 00:21:41,742
Besides, I need you to...

208
00:21:43,085 --> 00:21:47,215
- I went to a fertility clinic.
- Oh, good, more doctors.

209
00:21:47,256 --> 00:21:52,091
- Mary, I can't have this discussion again.
- No, this is a specialist.

210
00:21:52,127 --> 00:21:56,462
He said that with surgery I might get pregnant.
You need to donate sperm...

211
00:21:56,499 --> 00:21:59,024
- No.
- I could take care of him.

212
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:02,527
But I can't. So what's the point?

213
00:22:04,474 --> 00:22:07,136
This is what I most want in the world.

214
00:22:07,644 --> 00:22:09,771
Do it for me, please.

215
00:23:06,037 --> 00:23:08,529
This will be 58.95.

216
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,011
Thank you.

217
00:23:26,993 --> 00:23:30,326
Did you find everything you need, sir?

218
00:23:30,363 --> 00:23:32,525
I'll have...

219
00:23:32,566 --> 00:23:35,763
Oh, you know what? I left my wallet.

220
00:23:59,394 --> 00:24:02,022
- It's gonna be hot.
- Great.

221
00:24:03,665 --> 00:24:08,193
- When does my brother plan to show up?
- He said he'd be back by six.

222
00:24:13,308 --> 00:24:16,471
1 00% pure golden lager.

223
00:24:17,212 --> 00:24:19,305
Are you out of your mind?

224
00:24:20,548 --> 00:24:24,315
- Oh, it's warm.
- If you want to drink lemonade all night...

225
00:24:31,827 --> 00:24:33,954
Katie? Laura?

226
00:24:35,931 --> 00:24:37,922
Where are you guys?

227
00:24:53,183 --> 00:24:56,277
'To repeat the message, press one. To delete it...'

228
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:01,882
'Hi, it's Dad. I was hoping we could have lunch
one day next week. Give me a call.'

229
00:25:01,925 --> 00:25:06,055
'Hi, honey, I'm on my way home.
If you need me to pick up anything...'

230
00:25:06,096 --> 00:25:09,725
-
- 'Girls, no. Laura, stop it.

231
00:25:09,766 --> 00:25:13,760
'Give me a call on my cell. I'll see you in a bit. Bye.'

232
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:16,238
'To save the message, press...'

233
00:25:30,254 --> 00:25:32,085
Hello.

234
00:25:34,225 --> 00:25:36,558
Speaking.

235
00:25:45,971 --> 00:25:48,633
What?

236
00:25:52,878 --> 00:25:54,846
Where?

237
00:26:41,929 --> 00:26:45,092
Stay here. I'll be right back.

238
00:26:51,973 --> 00:26:56,103
You understand that even
if the operation is successful

239
00:26:56,144 --> 00:27:01,241
- artificial insemination doesn't always work.
- It doesn't matter. We want to try.

240
00:27:03,752 --> 00:27:05,413
Paul?

241
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:08,211
Yeah.

242
00:27:13,161 --> 00:27:15,221
Now, Paul, um...

243
00:27:16,265 --> 00:27:18,961
This is about having a child

244
00:27:19,001 --> 00:27:24,735
And, with your condition,
you know you probably won't ever meet him.

245
00:27:27,643 --> 00:27:29,770
Life goes on, right?

246
00:27:32,181 --> 00:27:37,141
I'd like you to put on one of these gloves
to avoid contaminating the sample.

247
00:27:37,186 --> 00:27:41,055
And try to make it all land in the receptacle.

248
00:27:42,492 --> 00:27:44,858
When you're done, just leave it in here.

249
00:27:47,597 --> 00:27:50,589
In case you need a little inspiration.

250
00:27:58,408 --> 00:28:00,933
'Hey, big boy, how are you doing?

251
00:28:00,977 --> 00:28:05,745
- 'Oh, yeah, are you ready to party?'
- 'Yeah, well, I'm here now.'

252
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,981
'Oh, yeah! Yeah!

253
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,014
'Oh! Oh, God!

254
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:18,028
'Mm! I'm gonna come really quick!

255
00:28:18,062 --> 00:28:19,393
'Oh!'

256
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:38,076
- 'Dr Swann, call the operator.'
-

257
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:42,177
Excuse me, my husband and daughters
were in an accident.

258
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:45,850
- What were their names?
- Michael, Katherine and Laura Peck.

259
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:48,325
OK.

260
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:53,596
Excuse me for a minute.

261
00:28:56,002 --> 00:28:58,596
- Cris?
- What happened, sweetheart?

262
00:28:58,638 --> 00:29:01,368
I don't know, they haven't told me yet.

263
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:04,706
- It's gonna be all right.
- Yeah, don't worry.

264
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:14,015
What is the most important question for safe sex?

265
00:29:15,722 --> 00:29:17,815
What time does your husband get home?

266
00:29:19,693 --> 00:29:22,093
That's good, huh?

267
00:29:28,035 --> 00:29:30,333
His Highness has arrived.

268
00:29:35,476 --> 00:29:38,377
Let's see what he comes up with.

269
00:29:40,848 --> 00:29:42,873
Serve up that chili.

270
00:29:49,391 --> 00:29:52,827
It's seven o'clock.
What are you gonna make up this time - traffic?

271
00:29:52,861 --> 00:29:57,662
You were preaching the word?
The entire congregation's been waiting for you.

272
00:29:57,699 --> 00:30:00,259
It's your party, remember?

273
00:30:00,302 --> 00:30:02,395
What's wrong?

274
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,131
Have you been drinking?

275
00:30:08,978 --> 00:30:11,412
You didn't drink again, did you?

276
00:30:12,915 --> 00:30:15,713
I just ran over a man and two girls.

277
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:21,955
You're lying, right?

278
00:30:29,565 --> 00:30:31,863
I was driving home...

279
00:30:33,236 --> 00:30:35,227
Took a turn...

280
00:30:37,307 --> 00:30:39,002
A little too quickly,

281
00:30:39,042 --> 00:30:41,010
Didn't see them crossing.

282
00:31:09,841 --> 00:31:12,435
Can't you go any faster?

283
00:31:16,047 --> 00:31:18,413
Oh...

284
00:31:27,893 --> 00:31:30,054
I love you.

285
00:31:36,435 --> 00:31:38,926
Deep breath.

286
00:31:41,106 --> 00:31:43,768
Good. Your lungs are clear.

287
00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:45,709
I have a question for you.

288
00:31:45,744 --> 00:31:47,770
Whose heart do I have?

289
00:31:48,682 --> 00:31:51,981
I can't tell you, it's hospital regulations.

290
00:31:52,018 --> 00:31:56,717
- The donor's family doesn't know you either.
- But you know?

291
00:31:56,756 --> 00:31:58,724
Yes.

292
00:31:58,758 --> 00:32:03,957
- This is your heart, that's all that should matter.
- I want to know who saved my life.

293
00:32:03,997 --> 00:32:07,728
You could write an anonymous letter
through the Donors' Association.

294
00:32:07,767 --> 00:32:10,793
Personally, I think it's better that you don't know.

295
00:32:26,287 --> 00:32:30,348
- Mrs. Peck? Dr. Jones.
- What happened to my family?

296
00:32:30,391 --> 00:32:33,622
- Please sit down.
- No, I'm OK.

297
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:37,189
- What happened?
- Your husband and daughters were hit by a car.

298
00:32:37,232 --> 00:32:40,326
We had to perform emergency surgery
on your husband.

299
00:32:40,368 --> 00:32:43,337
Your husband suffered multiple skull fractures

300
00:32:43,371 --> 00:32:47,171
And we had to remove blood clots
from around the brain.

301
00:32:47,209 --> 00:32:51,737
He's critical and we're concerned
that he's showing low brain activity.

302
00:32:53,882 --> 00:32:56,578
Is he gonna be all right?

303
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:59,213
We're doing the best we can.

304
00:32:59,254 --> 00:33:01,450
And what about my daughters?

305
00:33:07,597 --> 00:33:11,693
Your youngest daughter was brought in
with severe bleeding.

306
00:33:11,734 --> 00:33:14,498
She just wasn't able to get here in time.

307
00:33:15,304 --> 00:33:17,295
I'm very sorry. They...

308
00:33:18,241 --> 00:33:20,300
They both died in the accident.

309
00:33:21,444 --> 00:33:23,935
No.

310
00:33:25,281 --> 00:33:28,683
No...

311
00:33:31,655 --> 00:33:34,180
Oh, my God!

312
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:37,686
No! Oh, my God!

313
00:33:44,401 --> 00:33:46,369
Where are they?!

314
00:33:48,172 --> 00:33:50,403
Where... Where are they?

315
00:33:51,609 --> 00:33:55,773
Mrs. Peck, your girls are here
and you can see them if you like.

316
00:33:55,814 --> 00:34:00,649
I wanna see them.
I wouldn't recommend it.

317
00:34:00,685 --> 00:34:03,313
Oh, God, Daddy.

318
00:34:03,354 --> 00:34:08,018
I'm very sorry. If you'll excuse us,
we have to get back to Mr. Peck.

319
00:34:09,961 --> 00:34:12,122
I'm very sorry.

320
00:34:16,936 --> 00:34:19,461
Oh, God... Oh...

321
00:34:20,873 --> 00:34:22,568
Oh, God.

322
00:34:23,475 --> 00:34:28,139
- We want dinner!
- Marianne, we'd like some dinner in here.

323
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:35,452
Tell Reverend John to stay, make sure
no one notices and get everyone to leave.

324
00:34:35,487 --> 00:34:38,752
- What happened?
- Trish, just do what I tell you.

325
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,489
It's going to be OK.

326
00:34:43,363 --> 00:34:45,126
It's all gonna be OK.

327
00:34:46,366 --> 00:34:52,498
- Start the truck up, pull it in. Come on, baby.
-

328
00:35:30,612 --> 00:35:32,409
Hey, Jack!

329
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:36,207
What are you doing here, man?

330
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:39,585
Just came to pick up my things, Brown.

331
00:35:50,198 --> 00:35:54,192
- Why don't you let me buy you a couple of beers?
- I don't drink.

332
00:35:54,237 --> 00:35:56,137
How about a Diet Coke?

333
00:35:56,739 --> 00:36:00,573
I've been talking to a buddy
about hooking you up with a job,

334
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,942
I've been telling him all about you.

335
00:36:05,148 --> 00:36:09,016
So what do you say?
I've been feeling shitty about what went down.

336
00:36:09,052 --> 00:36:11,043
I understand.

337
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:13,020
So what do you say?

338
00:36:13,056 --> 00:36:17,925
As you know the doctors did everything they could
to save your husband's life

339
00:36:17,961 --> 00:36:20,760
But he has shown no brain activity.

340
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:27,397
We're here to help you with
some of the final decisions that need to be made.

341
00:36:27,438 --> 00:36:30,601
We have a patient who is gravely ill.

342
00:36:31,408 --> 00:36:35,367
I'm here to give you some information
on organ donation.

343
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:39,572
Are you willing for your husband
to donate his heart?

344
00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:42,346
- Can we discuss this another time?
- I'm afraid not.

345
00:36:42,386 --> 00:36:46,221
You can discuss it
but this is a decision that needs to be made soon.

346
00:36:46,257 --> 00:36:48,350
-
- Paul?

347
00:36:49,928 --> 00:36:51,953
Paul, the beeper.

348
00:37:00,438 --> 00:37:03,498
It's the hospital. I think they've got a heart.

349
00:37:10,049 --> 00:37:14,315
Hello? Yes, I'm calling on behalf of
Mr. Paul Rivers.

350
00:37:15,388 --> 00:37:16,855
Yes.

351
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:20,281
OK. Yes, I understand.

352
00:37:20,993 --> 00:37:22,961
Where do I have to take him?

353
00:37:52,659 --> 00:37:54,354
Good luck, my love.

354
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,624
Hello.

355
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,760
Hello.

356
00:39:11,407 --> 00:39:14,536
- Does your shoulder bother you?
- Why?

357
00:39:14,578 --> 00:39:18,207
I was watching you swim before
and you have a wide stroke.

358
00:39:18,249 --> 00:39:21,218
If you bring it in tighter you get a better glide.

359
00:39:24,221 --> 00:39:26,689
Thanks for the advice.

360
00:39:32,396 --> 00:39:35,763
- Do you mind if I join you?
- Actually, I was just leaving.

361
00:39:36,902 --> 00:39:38,893
There you go.

362
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,133
Maybe just until you finish?

363
00:39:44,176 --> 00:39:46,406
No, maybe next time.

364
00:39:55,187 --> 00:40:00,784
Did you know that eating alone
can cause kidney damage? And that's bad.

365
00:40:05,932 --> 00:40:07,661
All right. Sorry.

366
00:40:37,998 --> 00:40:39,989
'Hello?'

367
00:40:40,867 --> 00:40:43,097
Hello. Is Ana there?

368
00:40:43,136 --> 00:40:45,127
- What?
-

369
00:40:45,172 --> 00:40:47,663
- 'ls Ana there?'
- Hold on a sec. Ana?

370
00:40:48,609 --> 00:40:49,940
Ana!

371
00:40:49,977 --> 00:40:51,809
Phone call.

372
00:40:52,947 --> 00:40:54,778
Hello.

373
00:40:57,051 --> 00:40:58,848
'Hello?

374
00:41:01,489 --> 00:41:03,047
'Who is that?'

375
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:17,868
Hi, honey, I'm on my way home.
If you need me to pick up anything...

376
00:41:17,906 --> 00:41:21,364
Girls, no, don't touch. Laura, stop it.

377
00:41:22,211 --> 00:41:25,578
Give me a call on my cell. See you in a bit. Bye.

378
00:41:53,877 --> 00:41:55,868
Did you go?

379
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:03,113
Are they dead?

380
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:13,260
I'm gonna turn myself in.

381
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:16,266
John says nobody saw you, nobody.

382
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,565
They don't know the license plate
or what kind of car...

383
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:22,538
What would you do if these were our children?

384
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:26,202
- Tell me.
- They're not. It didn't happen to us.

385
00:42:29,548 --> 00:42:32,039
No, it didn't happen to us.

386
00:42:33,352 --> 00:42:35,684
It happened to me.

387
00:42:49,935 --> 00:42:53,098
What the fuck do you gain by turning yourself in?

388
00:42:53,138 --> 00:42:58,441
- It's my duty, Marianne.
- No, Jack, your duty is here with us,

389
00:42:59,045 --> 00:43:01,036
Your family.

390
00:43:02,882 --> 00:43:06,113
- My duty is to God.
- Please.

391
00:43:06,152 --> 00:43:08,985
Marianne,

392
00:43:09,021 --> 00:43:10,682
Get out of my way.

393
00:43:12,592 --> 00:43:14,389
Jack!

394
00:44:09,418 --> 00:44:12,649
-
- Oh, buddy! Right there.

395
00:44:13,189 --> 00:44:15,020
My turn.

396
00:44:16,325 --> 00:44:18,657
I think I better go back to the hospital.

397
00:44:22,798 --> 00:44:26,097
- He deserves it.
- I thought you're not supposed to eat that.

398
00:44:26,135 --> 00:44:30,094
- I'm making up for lost time.
- Lost time not lost pounds.

399
00:44:30,139 --> 00:44:32,733
We're gonna send you back for liposuction.

400
00:44:32,775 --> 00:44:37,543
Well, here's to all those...
who didn't think I was gonna die.

401
00:44:37,948 --> 00:44:40,178
Hear! Hear!

402
00:44:40,217 --> 00:44:42,276
And to the first day of my new life.

403
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:46,688
It's good to have you home.
Knew you'd make it.

404
00:44:46,723 --> 00:44:48,554
He's so wonderful.

405
00:44:48,592 --> 00:44:51,060
I also have an announcement to make.

406
00:44:51,094 --> 00:44:55,929
I wanted to tell you that Paul and l
are going to be parents.

407
00:44:55,966 --> 00:44:59,698
- That's great!
- There's a scary thought, Paul being a parent.

408
00:45:00,171 --> 00:45:03,163
- You kept this quiet.
- Have you told your folks?

409
00:45:03,207 --> 00:45:06,370
We're going to be parents,
we don't know when yet.

410
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:11,370
I'm going to have an operation
and then try artificial insemination.

411
00:45:11,415 --> 00:45:14,714
Terrific.
Artificial insemination?

412
00:45:14,752 --> 00:45:18,381
Do your female students know
you no longer have lead in your pencil?

413
00:45:18,422 --> 00:45:22,484
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Oh!

414
00:45:22,528 --> 00:45:24,723
Play nice.

415
00:45:25,364 --> 00:45:30,563
Come on, let's pass the cake around.
Cut me a piece about half that size.

416
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:32,467
I can't wait to hear about this.

417
00:45:48,821 --> 00:45:51,312
- Mr. Donneaud?
- Mr. Rivers?

418
00:45:52,158 --> 00:45:53,819
Thanks for coming.

419
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:58,797
Sorry I couldn't cancel my bowling
but the way I'm bowling I probably should have.

420
00:45:58,831 --> 00:46:00,526
Park it right there.

421
00:46:40,709 --> 00:46:44,042
- Can I bring you something to eat?
- I'm not hungry.

422
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,276
- Honey, you need to eat something.
- I'm fine, Dad.

423
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,577
When your mother died
I thought I wasn't going to make it.

424
00:46:55,724 --> 00:47:00,218
I felt that the world was falling on me
and I was never going to get up.

425
00:47:01,296 --> 00:47:05,233
But, sweetie, life goes on.

426
00:47:09,305 --> 00:47:11,637
You know what I thought when Mom died?

427
00:47:14,744 --> 00:47:19,477
I couldn't understand how
you could talk to people again.

428
00:47:21,183 --> 00:47:23,777
How you could laugh...

429
00:47:23,819 --> 00:47:25,980
Again.

430
00:47:27,024 --> 00:47:30,016
I couldn't understand how you could play with us.

431
00:47:32,796 --> 00:47:36,254
And no. No, that's a lie.

432
00:47:38,368 --> 00:47:40,962
Life does not just go on.

433
00:47:51,716 --> 00:47:58,280
Louise is getting fat, don't you think?
She's done nothing but eat since Robert left her.

434
00:47:59,357 --> 00:48:01,552
What, she looks OK to you?

435
00:48:02,393 --> 00:48:06,193
Why did you tell everybody we're having a baby?

436
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:08,164
I wanted to share our plans with them.

437
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:09,757
Oh.

438
00:48:11,069 --> 00:48:15,403
That's what I mean. Why does everyone
have to know our private life?

439
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,739
Why the fuss? They're our best friends.

440
00:48:18,777 --> 00:48:21,678
But we haven't even talked about it.

441
00:48:21,714 --> 00:48:26,413
- Oh, we haven't? I thought this was settled.
- Things change, Mary.

442
00:48:28,654 --> 00:48:33,182
- It's something we have to think about.
- I don't have anything to think about.

443
00:48:33,225 --> 00:48:35,887
I've already made my decision.

444
00:48:40,232 --> 00:48:42,201
Would you help me with the glasses?

445
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:58,476
Do you want me to stay tonight?
I'm OK, thanks.

446
00:49:02,555 --> 00:49:04,853
I just want to be alone.

447
00:49:15,269 --> 00:49:17,260
Cris...

448
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,831
The police called.

449
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:27,271
They said you need to go and press charges.

450
00:49:27,314 --> 00:49:29,305
I'll go with you if you want.

451
00:49:30,118 --> 00:49:32,279
I'm not going to do anything.

452
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:39,048
This guy was... was some ex-con.

453
00:49:39,094 --> 00:49:41,392
Are you going to let him walk the streets?

454
00:49:41,429 --> 00:49:45,661
- What do you want me to do?
- He ran over Michael and your daughters...

455
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:50,797
Nothing I can do is going to bring them back.
Do you get that?

456
00:50:01,284 --> 00:50:03,514
Hey, how are you doing?

457
00:50:03,553 --> 00:50:06,147
- You found it OK?
- Yeah, I did.

458
00:50:07,156 --> 00:50:10,990
The donor's name was Michael Peck.
He was 37 years old.

459
00:50:11,027 --> 00:50:13,120
An architect and married.

460
00:50:13,162 --> 00:50:17,690
This is the transplant authorization
signed by his wife, Cristina Williams Peck.

461
00:50:17,733 --> 00:50:21,033
I have a copy of the medical report
if you'd care to see it

462
00:50:21,071 --> 00:50:25,838
And I also have the widow's phone number
and address if you're interested.

463
00:50:25,876 --> 00:50:28,436
How did Michael Peck die?

464
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:32,848
You might have seen it in the newspaper.

465
00:50:33,917 --> 00:50:38,616
This guy named Jack Jordan
ran over Mr. Peck and his two little girls,

466
00:50:38,655 --> 00:50:40,646
October 1 0th, 6:50pm.

467
00:50:40,691 --> 00:50:45,459
This Jack Jordan's a piece of work.
He's been in and out of jails since he was 1 6.

468
00:50:45,496 --> 00:50:50,399
Car thief, small-time crook,
drugs, bad checks, alcoholism.

469
00:50:52,036 --> 00:50:55,301
Last time he was in jail was only two years ago.

470
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:01,637
You feeling OK, Mr. Rivers?

471
00:51:04,148 --> 00:51:06,139
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

472
00:51:07,185 --> 00:51:09,552
- I just...
- You want some water?

473
00:51:12,758 --> 00:51:17,752
- He was an architect.
- What's the point in getting involved?

474
00:51:20,733 --> 00:51:23,031
Mary, I want to know who I am now.

475
00:51:24,637 --> 00:51:26,935
I don't think that's the way to do it.

476
00:51:28,173 --> 00:51:30,164
What is, then?

477
00:51:33,178 --> 00:51:35,477
Look for it with me.

478
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:39,976
Let's look ahead together, not behind.

479
00:51:53,233 --> 00:51:58,194
Not drinking on your birthday?
Come over to my place, I'm having a party.

480
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:02,175
I bet they're all as boring as you.
You'd be surprised.

481
00:52:02,209 --> 00:52:05,872
- I'll pass. I call you later about that job.
- All right.

482
00:52:06,914 --> 00:52:08,575
Thank you.

483
00:52:12,153 --> 00:52:14,713
Hey, Brown, you should.

484
00:52:14,755 --> 00:52:16,746
I will.

485
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:54,294
We can schedule the surgery.
Erm... I could get you in as early as Monday.

486
00:52:57,166 --> 00:52:58,497
Yeah.

487
00:52:58,534 --> 00:53:00,434
9am?

488
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:03,564
What's the percentage chance
that Mary will get pregnant?

489
00:53:03,606 --> 00:53:10,205
I can't offer you a real number on that.
There's the abortion that wasn't handled properly...

490
00:53:10,246 --> 00:53:12,374
What abortion?

491
00:53:13,917 --> 00:53:16,078
What abortion, Mary?

492
00:53:16,487 --> 00:53:18,614
I can explain.

493
00:53:18,655 --> 00:53:21,419
- Explain what?
- There is an explanation.

494
00:53:21,458 --> 00:53:25,827
Uh-huh. All that drama
about artificial insemination,

495
00:53:25,863 --> 00:53:30,596
Kids' names, we got pictures
of our friends' babies all over the place.

496
00:53:30,634 --> 00:53:33,797
Why? So you can flush it down the fucking toilet?

497
00:53:37,008 --> 00:53:40,273
We've been a fraud for a long time, Mary.

498
00:53:40,311 --> 00:53:43,474
Oh, yeah? Why didn't you tell me that
when you were sick?

499
00:53:43,515 --> 00:53:46,848
Or did you expect one of your girlfriends
to take care of you?

500
00:53:46,885 --> 00:53:50,218
You came back because
you wanted to, don't blame me.

501
00:53:50,255 --> 00:53:54,157
- I came back because I love you.
- Or because you were lonely.

502
00:54:08,874 --> 00:54:10,774
I'm sorry.

503
00:54:11,811 --> 00:54:13,711
I'm sorry.

504
00:54:14,613 --> 00:54:17,309
We can't keep going like this.

505
00:54:17,349 --> 00:54:19,544
The insemination, the child.

506
00:54:20,553 --> 00:54:25,388
It's like we're trying to put a Band-Aid
on something that's been bled dry.

507
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,325
It's finished.

508
00:54:28,895 --> 00:54:30,556
Finished?

509
00:54:30,597 --> 00:54:34,590
It isn't finished if we give it a chance
and have this baby.

510
00:54:35,102 --> 00:54:39,198
- When we could have, you didn't want to.
- We were separated, goddamnit!

511
00:54:39,239 --> 00:54:41,639
- It's different now.
- Yes.

512
00:54:41,675 --> 00:54:44,166
- It's different.
-

513
00:54:44,211 --> 00:54:47,908
- Ready to go?
- You only know how to think about yourself.

514
00:54:55,623 --> 00:54:57,818
Close six.

515
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:04,357
Thanks for finally seeing me.

516
00:55:07,635 --> 00:55:10,001
They tell me you don't want to eat.

517
00:55:10,671 --> 00:55:12,662
I'm not hungry.

518
00:55:14,709 --> 00:55:16,610
Jack...

519
00:55:16,645 --> 00:55:19,773
Jesus didn't come to free us from pain.

520
00:55:19,815 --> 00:55:23,080
He came to give us the strength to bear it.

521
00:55:23,118 --> 00:55:26,918
- Maybe He wanted this pain for me.
- No, this was an accident.

522
00:55:26,955 --> 00:55:29,082
No, it wasn't an accident.

523
00:55:29,124 --> 00:55:31,422
Jesus chose me for this.

524
00:55:33,328 --> 00:55:35,853
Jack...

525
00:55:35,898 --> 00:55:38,059
Ask for the mercy of Jesus Christ.

526
00:55:39,868 --> 00:55:44,203
If it was an accident,
why do I have to ask for His mercy?

527
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:49,838
"l will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,
compassion on whom I will have compassion."

528
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:54,077
- Don't be so prideful, it's a sin.
- ".. the fearful, the unbelieving..."

529
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:57,746
- Jack, listen to me.
- ".. murderers, warmongers, idolaters,

530
00:55:57,787 --> 00:56:01,086
- "and all liars have their part in the lake..."
- Jesus came to save us not to damn us.

531
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:04,582
".. which burneth with fire and brimstone."
Revelation 21 :8.

532
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:08,792
Jesus loves you but He also knows
how to punish arrogant sinners like you.

533
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:13,132
"As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten."
Revelation 3: 1 9.

534
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:16,936
- Jesus betrayed me.
- Stop this shit or you're going to Hell.

535
00:56:16,974 --> 00:56:19,238
Hell?

536
00:56:19,276 --> 00:56:21,141
This is Hell.

537
00:56:21,178 --> 00:56:23,840
- Right here.
- You're damning your soul.

538
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:26,543
- Ask Christ for forgiveness.
- Forgive me?

539
00:56:26,584 --> 00:56:29,781
I did everything He asked me to do. I changed.

540
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:33,313
I gave Him my life and He betrayed me.

541
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:38,921
He put that fucking truck in my hands,
made me do His will and kill those people

542
00:56:38,964 --> 00:56:41,626
But He didn't give me
the strength to save them.

543
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:45,864
Don't blaspheme, you bastard!
Christ had nothing to do with this.

544
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:51,036
God even knows when a single hair
moves on your head.

545
00:56:53,178 --> 00:56:55,511
And you taught me that.

546
00:56:57,950 --> 00:57:00,282
We're gonna pray for you, Jack.

547
00:58:10,225 --> 00:58:12,716
Just like old times. How have you been?

548
00:58:13,862 --> 00:58:17,263
Did you end up marrying that hunk
you brought here last time?

549
00:58:17,299 --> 00:58:20,029
- Yep.
- Yeah?

550
00:58:20,069 --> 00:58:23,732
Is he a good lay? How they make us suffer, huh?

551
00:58:23,772 --> 00:58:26,866
It's all right, I got some great candy for you.

552
00:58:26,909 --> 00:58:31,005
Got Special K, angel dust
and your all-time favorite.

553
00:58:31,814 --> 00:58:36,309
And I got the newest of the new - R2.

554
00:58:36,353 --> 00:58:40,915
This shit's all the rage. You take two of these,
you go straight to heaven.

555
00:58:40,957 --> 00:58:45,656
- I'm not into chemicals.
- You're not a cuddly little kittie now, are you?

556
00:58:46,296 --> 00:58:49,060
If you don't like 'em, you don't pay for 'em.

557
00:58:53,636 --> 00:58:55,661
- That's my girl.
-

558
00:58:55,705 --> 00:58:58,299
It's busy.

559
00:59:01,612 --> 00:59:04,342
Hey, go easy on the booze tonight, right?

560
00:59:33,678 --> 00:59:36,203
- What the fuck are you...?
-

561
00:59:40,919 --> 00:59:43,251
What the fuck are you doing?

562
01:00:00,406 --> 01:00:02,135
Would you get my car, please?

563
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:06,168
What do you care? I don't need a fucking taxi.

564
01:00:06,212 --> 01:00:07,873
There's your fucking glass.

565
01:00:10,249 --> 01:00:12,183
-
-

566
01:00:12,218 --> 01:00:17,282
Stupid fucking asshole, move your car!
I'm fine! Get away from my car!

567
01:00:17,324 --> 01:00:20,157
There's no damage, OK? There's no damage.

568
01:00:20,194 --> 01:00:22,219
I know her, I can drive her home.

569
01:00:22,262 --> 01:00:26,892
- Is this any of your business?
- I'm your friend Paul, from the sports club.

570
01:00:27,734 --> 01:00:29,964
- Yeah, well...
- Remember?

571
01:00:31,205 --> 01:00:35,369
Yeah, well, can you tell these assholes
to get away from me?

572
01:00:35,409 --> 01:00:38,208
I'll drive her home, it's not a big deal. OK?

573
01:00:39,714 --> 01:00:43,013
- You can't drive like this.
- What do you care?

574
01:00:44,285 --> 01:00:47,277
You're going to get arrested, let me drive you.

575
01:00:47,689 --> 01:00:49,657
Please?

576
01:00:53,394 --> 01:00:55,328
Damn it.

577
01:03:28,656 --> 01:03:31,820
I sold the truck to pay for the lawyer.

578
01:03:33,094 --> 01:03:35,289
I didn't ask for a lawyer.

579
01:03:36,531 --> 01:03:38,522
Marianne, I didn't ask for...

580
01:03:38,566 --> 01:03:43,503
You want your children to spend another
two years without you? Is that what you want?

581
01:03:43,538 --> 01:03:45,836
This is God's will.

582
01:03:45,874 --> 01:03:47,808
So be it.

583
01:03:48,977 --> 01:03:51,775
Two years ago you didn't believe in anything.

584
01:03:51,813 --> 01:03:54,145
Now everything has to do with God.

585
01:03:55,418 --> 01:03:59,377
- I think I preferred you the way you were.
- I was a fucking pig.

586
01:03:59,422 --> 01:04:02,289
- Is that what you prefer?
- At least it was you.

587
01:04:02,324 --> 01:04:06,124
Now I don't have the slightest fucking idea
who you are.

588
01:04:08,097 --> 01:04:11,897
Life has to go on, Jack. With or without God.

589
01:04:58,116 --> 01:04:59,947
Hey, how are you doing?

590
01:04:59,984 --> 01:05:01,884
- How are you?
- Fine.

591
01:05:01,919 --> 01:05:03,978
Were you able to find anything out?

592
01:05:04,021 --> 01:05:09,220
Jack Jordan's living in a cheap motel,
out in the middle of nowhere. Phone records.

593
01:05:09,628 --> 01:05:13,997
- One of his prison fishy pals is from there.
- That was quick.

594
01:05:14,032 --> 01:05:16,796
Just a matter of checking the calls.

595
01:05:16,835 --> 01:05:20,669
Phone number and address
for the motel he's living in.

596
01:05:22,274 --> 01:05:27,576
Here's a pretty recent photo of Jordan,
taken the last time he was in jail.

597
01:05:30,349 --> 01:05:32,909
Did you get that other thing I asked about?

598
01:05:32,951 --> 01:05:34,351
Mm-hm.

599
01:05:37,924 --> 01:05:39,789
This is a clean gun. No record.

600
01:05:42,128 --> 01:05:44,426
We call this an orphan.

601
01:05:44,464 --> 01:05:46,364
It is loaded.

602
01:05:47,567 --> 01:05:50,502
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Careful there, hoss.

603
01:05:50,537 --> 01:05:55,236
You don't have to cock it, just pull the trigger.
This releases the cylinder.

604
01:05:57,844 --> 01:06:00,939
I think we're set to go. That's all I wanna know.

605
01:06:02,316 --> 01:06:04,614
- Thank you.
- Good luck to you.

606
01:06:20,334 --> 01:06:22,825
Ma'am, it's an hour since I called.

607
01:06:23,672 --> 01:06:26,573
46, St. Vincent Street.

608
01:06:27,642 --> 01:06:29,633
Thank you.

609
01:06:32,547 --> 01:06:35,414
- Hello.
- Hello.

610
01:06:38,153 --> 01:06:39,814
Some rain.

611
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:47,955
- Do you not have your car?
- No, but my taxi will be here in a minute.

612
01:06:48,631 --> 01:06:51,532
I'm right over here. I can give you a lift.

613
01:06:51,567 --> 01:06:53,467
No, thanks.

614
01:06:59,375 --> 01:07:02,572
I'm the guy who drove your car home last week.

615
01:07:05,248 --> 01:07:07,842
I'm sorry, I don't remember.

616
01:07:07,884 --> 01:07:09,715
I left my jacket with you.

617
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,353
Oh.

618
01:07:16,226 --> 01:07:18,057
Sorry.

619
01:07:19,429 --> 01:07:24,389
- I'll bring it by tomorrow.
- Are you sure I can't give you a ride?

620
01:07:24,434 --> 01:07:26,129
Or do you want to swim?

621
01:07:29,373 --> 01:07:31,341
OK.

622
01:07:58,036 --> 01:08:00,027
Hello.

623
01:08:24,897 --> 01:08:27,628
- Thanks.
- You're very welcome.

624
01:08:28,601 --> 01:08:31,764
Let me just give you my cell phone number.

625
01:08:32,339 --> 01:08:34,671
So that you have it.

626
01:08:40,246 --> 01:08:42,578
Would you have lunch with me tomorrow?

627
01:08:44,951 --> 01:08:47,112
What for?

628
01:08:48,755 --> 01:08:53,625
You're going to have to eat at some point
and I'm very worried about those kidneys.

629
01:08:54,862 --> 01:08:58,662
Come on - Lawrence's, two o'clock?
It's very nearby.

630
01:09:00,868 --> 01:09:03,701
- Please?
- OK. I'll see you tomorrow.

631
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:07,808
Great.

That's why you've been vomiting so much.

646
01:11:44,571 --> 01:11:48,064
So what are we saying,
I've got to change medication?

647
01:11:49,744 --> 01:11:55,808
OK, I'm going to be frank with you. The heart
that you're carrying is gonna give out soon.

648
01:11:55,850 --> 01:12:00,184
I need you to stay in the hospital
until I can find you another heart.

649
01:12:01,222 --> 01:12:05,352
- You want me to wait for a new heart?
- We don't have a lot of choice.

650
01:12:09,230 --> 01:12:14,692
I can't do that. I can't wait for someone else to die
locked up in a fucking room. I can't do it.

651
01:12:14,736 --> 01:12:18,832
You're dangerously close to heart failure, Paul.

652
01:12:19,675 --> 01:12:21,506
You might die...

653
01:12:22,211 --> 01:12:24,338
A lot sooner than you think.

654
01:12:30,219 --> 01:12:34,589
Let me ask you something.
I want you to be really honest with me, OK?

655
01:12:37,393 --> 01:12:39,384
If I stay...

656
01:12:40,797 --> 01:12:42,788
Will I be saved?

657
01:12:43,833 --> 01:12:45,630
I can't guarantee it.

658
01:12:45,668 --> 01:12:50,628
But if you don't come back to hospital,
you're condemning yourself to a terrible death.

659
01:12:50,673 --> 01:12:52,903
Your heart won't work anymore.

660
01:12:52,942 --> 01:12:58,437
You'll die, asphyxiated.
It's an awful death, Paul, you can't imagine it.

661
01:12:58,481 --> 01:13:02,919
- At least here we can help you to...
- You can help me die better.

662
01:13:03,621 --> 01:13:07,523
That's what you're saying.
You can help me die better.

663
01:13:07,558 --> 01:13:09,719
I'm not going to do that.

664
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,627
OK? I'd rather die outside.

665
01:13:15,032 --> 01:13:16,863
I'm not going to do it again.

666
01:13:22,906 --> 01:13:25,375
How much did the lawyer charge?

667
01:13:29,748 --> 01:13:32,114
Marianne, how much did the fucking lawyer...?

668
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:34,380
- Enough.
- How much?

669
01:13:34,419 --> 01:13:37,911
Enough so your children can remember
your fucking face.

670
01:13:39,424 --> 01:13:43,793
Keep asking stupid questions
and I'm getting out at the next corner.

671
01:13:57,510 --> 01:13:59,740
Hi, guys, we're home.

672

673
01:14:04,917 --> 01:14:08,648
- I brought you a kiss.
- You didn't bring me a present, huh?

674
01:14:08,688 --> 01:14:10,656
No, just a kiss.

675
01:14:10,690 --> 01:14:12,851
We made you a cake.

676
01:14:12,892 --> 01:14:16,590
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- Freddy put the icing on it.

677
01:14:19,866 --> 01:14:23,267
Freddy, are you going to say hello to your father?

678
01:14:25,672 --> 01:14:29,438
Freddy drew those for you.
I drew those ones.

679
01:14:31,878 --> 01:14:34,506
- Mommy made the cake.
- Come here.

680
01:14:37,684 --> 01:14:41,121
She did?
Come look at the cake, Daddy.

681
01:14:51,566 --> 01:14:53,625
Come on, Daddy.

682
01:14:54,202 --> 01:14:58,662
There is a number hidden in every act of life,
in every aspect of the universe.

683
01:14:58,706 --> 01:15:03,406
Fractals, matter...
There's a number screaming to tell us something.

684
01:15:04,713 --> 01:15:06,840
- Am I boring you?
- No.

685
01:15:07,983 --> 01:15:10,383
No, l...

686
01:15:11,186 --> 01:15:13,916
- Sorry.
- I try to tell them

687
01:15:13,956 --> 01:15:19,451
That numbers are a door
to understanding a mystery that's bigger than us.

688
01:15:20,262 --> 01:15:23,493
How two people, strangers, come to meet.

689
01:15:24,299 --> 01:15:28,293
There's a poem by a Venezuelan writer
that begins,

690
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:34,005
"The earth turned to bring us closer.

691
01:15:34,911 --> 01:15:37,311
"lt turned on itself and in us

692
01:15:37,914 --> 01:15:41,247
"until it finally brought us together in this dream."

693
01:15:46,623 --> 01:15:49,319
That's beautiful.

694
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:53,922
There are so many things that have to happen
for two people to meet...

695
01:15:53,964 --> 01:15:57,695
Anyway that's what mathematics are.

696
01:16:03,174 --> 01:16:06,940
How long have you been swimming?
A few years.

697
01:16:06,977 --> 01:16:11,971
- It doesn't bore you?
- No. It's what makes me feel normal.

698
01:16:12,016 --> 01:16:15,952
If I didn't swim or walk or do something,
I think I'd go crazy.

699
01:16:17,622 --> 01:16:19,590
Thanks for lunch.

700
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:22,991
Yeah. Goodbye.

701
01:16:24,196 --> 01:16:25,959
Do you want to come in?

702
01:16:25,997 --> 01:16:29,228
No, thanks... Yes, I do want to come in.

703
01:17:42,343 --> 01:17:43,776
Hey!

704
01:17:44,212 --> 01:17:46,373
Can I ask you something?

705
01:17:46,414 --> 01:17:47,881
Huh?

706
01:17:47,916 --> 01:17:51,010
OK, I have a gun, OK? Don't look at me.

707
01:17:51,052 --> 01:17:55,318
- Don't look at me, I'll shoot you. Turn around.
- I don't have any money.

708
01:17:55,356 --> 01:17:58,155
- Go. Walk. Walk.
- Hey, come on.

709
01:17:58,861 --> 01:18:02,058
- Put them up. Put your hands up.
- Why? Wait.

710
01:18:02,097 --> 01:18:04,657
Just walk. Go.

711
01:18:05,167 --> 01:18:07,067
- Go down that path.
- Sir...

712
01:18:07,102 --> 01:18:10,401
- Do it and you won't get hurt.
- Please. I don't have...

713
01:18:10,439 --> 01:18:12,134
I'm not looking...

714
01:18:12,174 --> 01:18:14,734
Come on, keep walking. Right down here.

715
01:18:14,777 --> 01:18:19,009
Keep walking. Don't look at me,
I'll shoot you in the head. Hands up!

716
01:18:19,048 --> 01:18:23,509
Walk. Look, over here, over here. Come on.

717
01:18:23,553 --> 01:18:25,453
Don't look at me. Keep going.

718
01:18:26,122 --> 01:18:28,488
Stop. Right here, OK...

719
01:18:28,525 --> 01:18:31,551
Stop. Turn around.

720
01:18:31,595 --> 01:18:34,462
Keep your hands on your head.

721
01:18:35,031 --> 01:18:39,263
G-G-Get... Take your shoes off
and get down on your knees.

722
01:18:39,302 --> 01:18:41,236
Take off your shoes.

723
01:18:41,671 --> 01:18:45,904
No, not that one! Just get down on your knees!
Get down on your knees!

724
01:18:46,978 --> 01:18:49,071
Sir, please...

725
01:18:52,984 --> 01:18:55,043
Shouldn't have done it.

726
01:18:57,722 --> 01:19:00,452
- Done what?
- You shouldn't have done it!

727
01:19:02,326 --> 01:19:04,726
Close your goddamn eyes!

728
01:19:49,142 --> 01:19:52,839
- She looked me in the eyes.
- What are you talking about?

729
01:19:58,317 --> 01:20:01,014
One of the girls that I killed.

730
01:20:01,055 --> 01:20:03,114
She looked me in the eye.

731
01:20:07,795 --> 01:20:10,263
She wanted to tell me something.

732
01:20:13,133 --> 01:20:14,930
I left her.

733
01:20:14,968 --> 01:20:17,232
I left her there.

734
01:20:21,709 --> 01:20:23,734
I ran away.

735
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:27,674
- No...
- I ran away.

736
01:20:27,716 --> 01:20:31,277
I ran away. I ran away.

737
01:20:31,319 --> 01:20:33,378
Ran away.

738
01:20:34,456 --> 01:20:36,924
- Ran away.
- Shh-shh-shh...

739
01:20:48,436 --> 01:20:51,304
- You're sticking with red?
- Sure.

740
01:21:33,950 --> 01:21:35,679
Are you OK?

741
01:21:36,686 --> 01:21:38,552
Yeah.

742
01:21:41,058 --> 01:21:43,026
I, um...

743
01:21:44,996 --> 01:21:49,592
- I'm sorry, I had a dizzy...
- Can I get you a glass of water or something?

744
01:21:50,835 --> 01:21:52,769
I think I should go home.

745
01:21:53,538 --> 01:21:56,234
I'm sorry, I just...

746
01:22:04,049 --> 01:22:07,212
I like you a lot, Cristina.

747
01:22:07,853 --> 01:22:11,789
It's been a long time
since I liked someone so much.

748
01:22:15,828 --> 01:22:17,853
Can I see you again?

749
01:22:20,332 --> 01:22:22,197
I'm a married woman.

750
01:22:24,536 --> 01:22:26,527
I figured.

751
01:22:34,247 --> 01:22:36,772
- Thanks.
- Goodbye.

752
01:22:54,235 --> 01:23:00,196
I got peace like a river
I got peace like a river

753
01:23:00,241 --> 01:23:05,804
I got peace like a river in my soul...

754
01:23:05,846 --> 01:23:09,839
- Everybody!
- I got love like an ocean

755
01:23:09,884 --> 01:23:13,183
I got love like an ocean

756
01:23:13,220 --> 01:23:18,716
I got love like an ocean in my soul

757
01:23:19,427 --> 01:23:25,764
I got joy like a fountain
I got joy like a fountain

758
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:31,534
I got joy like a fountain in my soul...

759
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:35,499
Look, Daddy, these are the zebras
and these are the lions.

760
01:23:35,543 --> 01:23:38,671
- Very pretty.
- You've never been to a zoo.

761
01:23:38,713 --> 01:23:41,273
- I've seen them in...
- Stop fighting.

762
01:23:43,619 --> 01:23:47,248
The lawyer called to remind you
you have to go sign on Monday.

763
01:23:49,892 --> 01:23:52,156
If you want I'll go with you to church.

764
01:23:52,194 --> 01:23:55,686
In school they said
you killed two girls and their daddy.

765
01:23:55,731 --> 01:23:57,995
Is that true?

766
01:23:58,935 --> 01:24:00,562
- Yes.
- No.

767
01:24:01,504 --> 01:24:05,304
Yes. He killed them.

768
01:24:06,309 --> 01:24:09,541
It was an accident, sweetie.

769
01:24:09,579 --> 01:24:11,570
You understand?

770
01:24:15,552 --> 01:24:20,182
Oh, Jesus,
every time I look at my children...

771
01:24:36,374 --> 01:24:38,205
Hello?

772
01:24:40,144 --> 01:24:41,805
Hello?

773
01:24:41,846 --> 01:24:43,677
'Paul?'

774
01:24:48,252 --> 01:24:50,447
Who... Who is this?

775
01:24:50,488 --> 01:24:52,422
'Cristina.

776
01:24:55,059 --> 01:24:57,028
'Did I wake you?'

777
01:24:58,063 --> 01:25:00,429
Hang on a second.

778
01:25:05,471 --> 01:25:07,098
Hi.

779
01:25:07,906 --> 01:25:10,807
- 'Did I wake you?'
- No, that's OK.

780
01:25:12,845 --> 01:25:16,281
'Um, could... could you come to my house?'

781
01:25:18,417 --> 01:25:21,717
- Is something wrong?
- 'No, I just...

782
01:25:23,189 --> 01:25:25,953
'l just want you to come if you can.

783
01:25:26,893 --> 01:25:30,329
- 'Or if you want to.'
- Yeah.

784
01:25:31,031 --> 01:25:33,522
I'll be right there.

785
01:25:33,566 --> 01:25:35,397
'Thanks.'

786
01:25:35,435 --> 01:25:37,096
OK.

787
01:25:40,974 --> 01:25:44,171
It's two in the morning, who were you talking to?

788
01:25:44,210 --> 01:25:46,202
I won't be long.

789
01:25:47,381 --> 01:25:49,246
Where are you going?

790
01:25:49,283 --> 01:25:53,913
- I said I won't be long.
- Exactly where and with who are you going?

791
01:25:55,122 --> 01:25:58,285
I thought you'd change after the transplant.

792
01:25:58,325 --> 01:26:00,657
And I thought you'd change if I did.

793
01:26:00,694 --> 01:26:02,685
Neither of us changed.

794
01:26:54,050 --> 01:26:56,746
- What's wrong?
- He's been shot in the chest.

795
01:26:56,786 --> 01:27:00,848
Come on.
Shot in the chest. In the chest.

796
01:27:01,892 --> 01:27:05,521
- How's long he's been like that?
- He's dying! We need a...

797
01:27:05,562 --> 01:27:07,655
I'll go get a stretcher.

798
01:27:07,698 --> 01:27:10,929
- Ma'am, he'll be right back.
- It's OK, baby.

799
01:27:13,003 --> 01:27:15,301
I shot him.

800
01:27:15,339 --> 01:27:17,534
- I don't have the gun.
- What?

801
01:27:17,574 --> 01:27:20,975
- I shot him.
- Control, I need you to call the police.

802
01:27:21,745 --> 01:27:24,647
It's an emergency, yes. I'm right out front.

803
01:27:36,161 --> 01:27:38,061
Hi.

804
01:27:40,832 --> 01:27:43,164
Are you OK?

805
01:27:53,045 --> 01:27:55,741
You kept me thinking all day.

806
01:27:57,316 --> 01:28:01,844
You see, I haven't spoken to anyone in months

807
01:28:01,887 --> 01:28:04,117
And I barely know you

808
01:28:04,156 --> 01:28:07,887
And I already need to talk to you.

809
01:28:10,095 --> 01:28:11,960
And...

810
01:28:14,067 --> 01:28:18,128
There's something
the more I think about, the less I understand.

811
01:28:21,541 --> 01:28:24,408
Why the hell did you tell me that you liked me?

812
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:30,379
Answer me because
I didn't like you saying that at all.

813
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:38,020
You can't just walk up to a woman
you barely know and tell her you like her.

814
01:28:38,058 --> 01:28:41,722
You can't do that,
you don't know what she's going through.

815
01:28:42,296 --> 01:28:44,457
Or what she's feeling.

816
01:28:47,368 --> 01:28:49,700
I'm not married.

817
01:28:56,911 --> 01:28:59,505
- It's OK.
-

818
01:29:01,449 --> 01:29:03,714
- I'm sorry.
- No.

819
01:29:35,151 --> 01:29:37,517
Cristina... Wait.

820
01:29:38,454 --> 01:29:40,445
- I have to tell you something.
- OK.

821
01:29:40,490 --> 01:29:42,481
- Please.
- Kiss me.

822
01:29:42,525 --> 01:29:44,254
Wait, Cristina.

823
01:29:45,128 --> 01:29:46,993
Cristina...

824
01:29:49,832 --> 01:29:52,266
I have Michael's heart.

825
01:29:53,737 --> 01:29:55,728
I have Michael's heart.

826
01:29:58,008 --> 01:30:00,135
You understand what I'm saying?

827
01:30:00,544 --> 01:30:04,878
It was transplanted into me
at St. Francis Hospital on October 1 1th.

828
01:30:05,582 --> 01:30:07,049
No.

829
01:30:07,084 --> 01:30:10,611
I tried to tell you, I just didn't know how to tell you.

830
01:30:10,654 --> 01:30:12,645
How dare you?

831
01:30:13,624 --> 01:30:16,752
How dare you! How fucking dare you!

832
01:30:16,794 --> 01:30:19,559
- I'm here for a reason.
- Get out of my house!

833
01:30:21,232 --> 01:30:24,201
Don't touch me! Get out of my house now!

834
01:30:24,235 --> 01:30:27,170
- You make me sick!
- I'm here for a reason!

835
01:30:27,205 --> 01:30:28,968
Get out of my fucking...

836
01:30:29,007 --> 01:30:32,067
Get the fuck out of my house, you make me sick!

837
01:30:32,711 --> 01:30:34,406
Get out!

838
01:31:41,582 --> 01:31:43,573
Good morning.

839
01:31:53,761 --> 01:31:55,922
Why did you look for me?

840
01:31:59,435 --> 01:32:01,699
Because I needed to.

841
01:32:03,071 --> 01:32:05,665
I don't want your fucking pity.

842
01:32:07,576 --> 01:32:09,407
That wasn't it.

843
01:32:17,085 --> 01:32:20,020
I was sick, Cristina, I was very sick.

844
01:32:23,126 --> 01:32:26,960
I was dying when Michael gave me his heart.

845
01:32:31,134 --> 01:32:33,068
He saved my life.

846
01:32:38,975 --> 01:32:42,672
I tried in every way I knew how to find out...

847
01:32:43,379 --> 01:32:45,974
Who had given me this heart.

848
01:32:46,016 --> 01:32:50,385
And that's how I found out
how he and your daughters had died.

849
01:32:55,759 --> 01:32:59,024
It's very painful for me to know how I got this heart.

850
01:33:00,698 --> 01:33:03,030
I couldn't sleep.

851
01:33:03,934 --> 01:33:07,700
I wanted to thank you.
I wanted to help in some way.

852
01:33:07,738 --> 01:33:10,002
I just wanted to thank you for...

853
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:17,648
But I couldn't find you.

854
01:33:21,753 --> 01:33:23,584
And then I saw you

855
01:33:25,223 --> 01:33:27,282
That day.

856
01:33:30,762 --> 01:33:33,356
And now I can't be away from you.

857
01:33:37,069 --> 01:33:39,060
I can't.

858
01:33:46,646 --> 01:33:49,046
You don't have to be afraid.

859
01:33:51,717 --> 01:33:53,981
I've got a good heart.

860
01:34:10,704 --> 01:34:12,695
I'm scared too.

861
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:06,082
- 'Why did you leave us, Jack?'
- I'm where I have to be.

862
01:36:06,124 --> 01:36:11,152
- 'Gina got sick from the hamster.'
- The past is like the Atlantic Ocean.

863
01:36:11,196 --> 01:36:13,494
Back when I was me.

864
01:36:13,532 --> 01:36:18,629
- But the decisions I make, that's my mirror.
- 'What are you talking about?'

865
01:36:18,670 --> 01:36:20,501
That's my mirror.

866
01:36:20,539 --> 01:36:24,635
- 'lt doesn't matter.'
- I have to live with them alone.

867
01:36:24,676 --> 01:36:27,167
- 'Come back to us.'
- I can't erase it.

868
01:36:27,212 --> 01:36:30,444
- 'Your family needs you.'
- No one can erase it.

869
01:36:32,485 --> 01:36:34,214
'For me...'

870
01:36:39,992 --> 01:36:43,553
We need to stabilize him
before we get him to the hospital.

871
01:36:43,596 --> 01:36:47,396
Right now, what we really need
are units of B-positive blood.

872
01:36:47,433 --> 01:36:49,697
I'm O-positive, will that work?

873
01:36:49,736 --> 01:36:52,330
Open and close your fist several times.

874
01:38:39,183 --> 01:38:41,413
'Go ahead.'

875
01:38:44,989 --> 01:38:47,150
OK, pal.

876
01:38:47,191 --> 01:38:49,625
You're free to go for lack of evidence.

877
01:38:51,796 --> 01:38:55,755
Your story doesn't check out,
it contradicts our investigation

878
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:59,498
And the statements made
by Mrs. Peck and Mr. Rivers.

879
01:39:00,305 --> 01:39:02,296
I just need you to sign here.

880
01:39:02,908 --> 01:39:04,933
What if I really am guilty?

881
01:39:05,544 --> 01:39:07,671
Yeah, well, it happens.

882
01:39:08,113 --> 01:39:11,344
It won't be the first time, it won't be the last.

883
01:40:14,582 --> 01:40:16,675
What are you doing?

884
01:40:16,718 --> 01:40:20,882
You've been lost for too many days,
don't you think, you prick?

885
01:40:21,456 --> 01:40:23,617
Mary, I don't want a fight.

886
01:40:23,658 --> 01:40:28,391
- I want this to end well.
- And that means disappearing for a few days?

887
01:40:29,297 --> 01:40:32,858
You just waited until you got better
to tell me to fuck off.

888
01:40:32,901 --> 01:40:34,835
I'm going back to London.

889
01:40:34,869 --> 01:40:37,668
- You can't keep doing this.
- Really?

890
01:40:37,707 --> 01:40:40,972
I'll have surgery
and I'll be inseminated with your child.

891
01:40:41,010 --> 01:40:43,478
- With or without you.
- Mary, what for?

892
01:40:43,512 --> 01:40:45,503
- Why?
- Because I want to.

893
01:40:47,249 --> 01:40:49,774
- Well, I won't authorize that.
- No?

894
01:40:49,819 --> 01:40:54,882
You already have. I have a signed copy
of your authorization to use your semen.

895
01:40:54,924 --> 01:40:57,916
- What do you gain?
- I get what I want.

896
01:40:57,994 --> 01:41:00,623
You decide if you come looking for me or not.

897
01:42:52,813 --> 01:42:56,943
'Hi, honey, I'm on my way home.
If you need me to pick up anything...

898
01:42:56,984 --> 01:43:00,977
- 'Girls, no, don't touch. Laura, stop it.'
-

899
01:43:01,021 --> 01:43:04,321
'Give me a call on my cell. See you in a bit. Bye.'

900
01:43:04,359 --> 01:43:08,523
'To repeat the message, press one.
To delete, press two.'

901
01:43:10,532 --> 01:43:14,662
'Hi, honey, I'm on my way home.
If you need me to pick up anything...

902
01:43:14,703 --> 01:43:19,140
- 'Girls, no, don't touch. Laura, stop it.'
-

903
01:43:19,174 --> 01:43:22,041
'Give me a call on my cell. See you in a bit. Bye.'

904
01:44:50,069 --> 01:44:54,267
- I'm grilling some chicken, you want any?
- No, thanks.

905
01:44:54,306 --> 01:44:56,297
I could make you a sandwich...

906
01:44:56,342 --> 01:44:58,503
No. No, no, no. No!

907
01:45:00,512 --> 01:45:02,343
Cristina, Cristina,

908
01:45:02,381 --> 01:45:04,042
Iisten to me.

909
01:45:04,583 --> 01:45:07,347
You don't need that shit. You need...

910
01:45:07,386 --> 01:45:10,220
Don't tell me what I need.

911
01:45:53,267 --> 01:45:55,394
Katie could have lived.

912
01:45:57,439 --> 01:45:58,872
What?

913
01:46:00,275 --> 01:46:03,938
She'd be alive right now
but that bastard left her there.

914
01:46:06,081 --> 01:46:08,515
Lying in the street.

915
01:46:08,550 --> 01:46:13,544
He left the three of them like animals.
He didn't care.

916
01:46:17,592 --> 01:46:19,787
At least she could be here with me.

917
01:46:21,096 --> 01:46:24,191
That son of a bitch is walking the streets.

918
01:46:24,233 --> 01:46:28,829
- And I can't even go into their room.
- He's walking the streets?

919
01:46:31,441 --> 01:46:33,432
I want to kill him.

920
01:46:33,476 --> 01:46:35,706
You want to kill him?

921
01:46:35,745 --> 01:46:39,875
I'm gonna kill Jack Jordan.
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

922
01:46:39,916 --> 01:46:44,683
- Slow down, Cristina, just slow down.
- Slow down? Slow down?

923
01:46:44,721 --> 01:46:47,816
- While I what, huh? While I what?!
- Take it easy.

924
01:46:47,858 --> 01:46:51,487
Take it easy? My husband
and my little girls are dead

925
01:46:51,528 --> 01:46:53,792
And I'm supposed to take it fucking easy?!

926
01:46:54,565 --> 01:46:57,466
I can't just go on with my life!

927
01:46:57,501 --> 01:47:03,167
I am paralyzed here,
I am a fucking amputee, do you see that?!

928
01:47:03,574 --> 01:47:05,804
Who are you?!

929
01:47:05,843 --> 01:47:09,677
You owe it to Michael. No, you've got his heart,

930
01:47:09,713 --> 01:47:13,775
You're in his house, fucking his wife
and sitting in his chair!

931
01:47:13,818 --> 01:47:16,685
- We have to kill him!
- Not like this.

932
01:47:16,721 --> 01:47:19,121
Then how, tell me how!

933
01:47:38,244 --> 01:47:40,235
Katie died...

934
01:47:41,914 --> 01:47:44,474
With red shoelaces on.

935
01:47:44,517 --> 01:47:47,281
She hated red shoelaces.

936
01:47:50,389 --> 01:47:53,290
And she kept asking me
to get her some blue ones

937
01:47:53,325 --> 01:47:56,055
And I never got her the blue ones.

938
01:47:57,797 --> 01:48:01,962
She was wearing those fucking red shoelaces
when she was killed.

939
01:48:19,820 --> 01:48:21,447
You shouldn't have done it.

940
01:48:21,488 --> 01:48:24,514
Close your... close your goddamn eyes!

941
01:48:34,869 --> 01:48:37,804
You... murderer.

942
01:48:37,839 --> 01:48:40,603
You just let them lie there on the street.

943
01:48:40,641 --> 01:48:45,669
Those two little girls, you just let them die
like dogs. I should have killed you.

944
01:48:47,882 --> 01:48:52,582
Now you disappear. Don't even
go back to the motel and get your things.

945
01:48:53,322 --> 01:48:55,313
Just disappear.

946
01:49:34,397 --> 01:49:36,831
Mrs. Peck.

947
01:49:36,866 --> 01:49:41,531
- How is he?
- We couldn't use your blood for his transfusion.

948
01:49:41,572 --> 01:49:47,135
We found high levels of illegal substances
in your blood. You're taking very high risks here.

949
01:49:47,177 --> 01:49:51,375
- That's my problem.
- In your state, I suggest you stop using them.

950
01:49:52,650 --> 01:49:56,450
- What are you talking about?
- You're pregnant, Mrs. Peck.

951
01:50:01,859 --> 01:50:06,388
- You're sure?
- You need to start taking care of yourself.

952
01:50:06,998 --> 01:50:10,195
We'll let you know when Mr. Rivers
is out of the O. R.

953
01:51:02,189 --> 01:51:04,180
Where were you?

954
01:51:08,161 --> 01:51:10,493
Did you kill him?

955
01:51:11,031 --> 01:51:13,090
Did you?

956
01:51:21,776 --> 01:51:23,971
Why didn't you wake me up?

957
01:51:25,713 --> 01:51:27,874
Where's the body?

958
01:51:28,583 --> 01:51:30,949
Nobody will ever find the body.

959
01:52:01,950 --> 01:52:04,282
I'm sorry.

960
01:52:04,319 --> 01:52:06,446
We're gonna go home now.

961
01:52:08,358 --> 01:52:11,156
Let's just get out of here, OK? Yeah?

962
01:52:15,131 --> 01:52:18,225
It's OK, baby. Just lie down.

963
01:52:20,370 --> 01:52:23,032
- I need to rest.
- I know.

964
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:25,671
I know.

965
01:52:26,910 --> 01:52:29,174
I'm sorry.

966
01:52:33,117 --> 01:52:35,585
I love you.

967
01:52:37,755 --> 01:52:40,417
I love you. I love you.

968
01:52:40,458 --> 01:52:41,925
Oh!

969
01:53:10,455 --> 01:53:12,446
Wake up.

970
01:53:13,558 --> 01:53:15,389
Mm? Mm?

971
01:53:15,427 --> 01:53:17,418
There's somebody outside.

972
01:53:49,029 --> 01:53:51,657
Oh, my God!

973
01:53:52,166 --> 01:53:54,999
- Oh, my God.
- You want to kill me?

974
01:53:56,503 --> 01:53:59,734
- What's he doing here?
- Here I am.

975
01:54:00,974 --> 01:54:02,703
Shoot me.

976
01:54:02,743 --> 01:54:06,474
- Quick... Oh!
-

977
01:54:06,513 --> 01:54:09,141
- Oh, my God.
-

978
01:54:09,183 --> 01:54:11,344
Do something!

979
01:54:55,865 --> 01:54:59,926
- Oh...
-

980
01:55:00,937 --> 01:55:02,871
No, baby. Oh, no...

981
01:55:02,906 --> 01:55:04,498
No, no...

982
01:55:04,541 --> 01:55:08,068
- Oh, my God! Baby... baby...
-

983
01:55:08,111 --> 01:55:10,045
Oh, my God...

984
01:55:11,214 --> 01:55:14,081
- Baby...
-

985
01:55:14,117 --> 01:55:17,348
Baby, baby, baby...

986
01:55:17,387 --> 01:55:19,218
Baby!

987
01:55:20,023 --> 01:55:23,754
- Oh, God! Call an ambulance.
-

988
01:55:26,864 --> 01:55:29,526
Call a fucking ambulance!

989
01:55:52,624 --> 01:55:54,683
'How many lives do we live?'

990
01:55:56,695 --> 01:55:59,289
'How many times do we die?

991
01:56:04,836 --> 01:56:11,071
'They say we all lose 21 grams
at the exact moment of our death.

992
01:56:11,843 --> 01:56:13,834
'Everyone.

993
01:56:15,581 --> 01:56:19,847
'And how much fits into 21 grams?

994
01:56:24,424 --> 01:56:26,688
'How much is lost?'

995
01:56:36,836 --> 01:56:39,566
'When do we lose 21 grams?

996
01:56:54,755 --> 01:56:56,780
'How much goes with them?

997
01:57:11,039 --> 01:57:13,030
'How much is gained?

998
01:57:23,151 --> 01:57:26,143
'How much is gained?

999
01:57:37,700 --> 01:57:40,168
'21 grams.

1000
01:57:40,603 --> 01:57:44,437
'The weight of a stack of five nickels,

1001
01:57:44,473 --> 01:57:46,737
'the weight of a hummingbird.

1002
01:57:47,777 --> 01:57:49,938
'A chocolate bar.

1003
01:57:51,981 --> 01:57:54,917
'How much do 21 grams weigh?'

1004
01:58:19,277 --> 01:58:21,472
To Maria Eladia.

1005
01:58:21,512 --> 01:58:26,347
And when loss was burnt,
the maize fields became green again

1006
02:00:37,787 --> 02:00:40,620
One last kiss

1007
02:00:40,656 --> 02:00:43,648
One only

1008
02:00:44,627 --> 02:00:46,891
Then I'd let you go

1009
02:00:49,733 --> 02:00:52,861
Hard for you

1010
02:00:52,903 --> 02:00:55,269
I've fallen

1011
02:00:56,206 --> 02:00:59,175
But you can break my fall

1012
02:01:01,745 --> 02:01:04,714
I'm broken

1013
02:01:04,748 --> 02:01:07,342
Don't break me

1014
02:01:08,585 --> 02:01:10,985
When I hit the ground

1015
02:01:13,324 --> 02:01:16,350
Some devil

1016
02:01:16,394 --> 02:01:19,158
Some angel

1017
02:01:20,098 --> 02:01:23,556
Has got me to the bones

1018
02:01:25,303 --> 02:01:30,297
You said always and forever

1019
02:01:32,910 --> 02:01:37,143
Now I believe you, baby

1020
02:01:37,182 --> 02:01:43,246
You said always and forever

1021
02:01:44,757 --> 02:01:49,194
Is such a long, lonely time

1022
02:02:01,541 --> 02:02:04,476
Too drunk and

1023
02:02:04,511 --> 02:02:07,275
Still drinking

1024
02:02:08,515 --> 02:02:11,245
It's just the way I feel

1025
02:02:13,853 --> 02:02:16,515
It's all right

1026
02:02:16,556 --> 02:02:19,354
That's what you told me

1027
02:02:20,460 --> 02:02:24,897
Cos what we had was so beautiful

1028
02:02:25,732 --> 02:02:28,930
I feel heavy

1029
02:02:28,969 --> 02:02:31,529
Like floating

1030
02:02:32,406 --> 02:02:37,434
At the bottom of the sea

1031
02:02:37,478 --> 02:02:43,678
You said always and forever

1032
02:02:45,319 --> 02:02:49,312
Now I believe you, baby

1033
02:02:49,357 --> 02:02:55,661
You said always and forever

1034
02:02:57,132 --> 02:03:02,297
Is such a long, lonely time

1035
02:03:14,049 --> 02:03:16,883
Some devil is

1036
02:03:16,919 --> 02:03:19,945
Stuck inside of me

1037
02:03:20,790 --> 02:03:24,920
I cannot set it free

1038
02:03:24,961 --> 02:03:31,730
I wish, I wish I was dead and you were breathing

1039
02:03:32,769 --> 02:03:35,533
Just so that you could know

1040
02:03:37,874 --> 02:03:41,003
Some angel is

1041
02:03:41,044 --> 02:03:44,639
Stuck inside of me

1042
02:03:44,681 --> 02:03:47,878
I cannot set you free

1043
02:03:49,953 --> 02:03:55,949
You said always and forever

1044
02:03:57,628 --> 02:04:01,928
Now I believe you, baby

1045
02:04:01,965 --> 02:04:07,927
You said always and forever

1046
02:04:09,908 --> 02:04:14,777
Such a long, lonely time

1047
02:04:17,215 --> 02:04:19,877
Stuck inside of me
