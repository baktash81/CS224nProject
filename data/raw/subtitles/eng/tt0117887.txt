You are the winter,
Fall, and spring

00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:41,068
You are the sun
That summertime brings

3
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,541
You are the stars
In the nighttime sky

4
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,078
You are my girl,
And I'm your guy

5
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,671
You got me all tied up
In knots

6

And I'm lovin' you
Lots and lots

Ahoo-hoo hoo hoo hoo

You are as fresh
As the morning air

18
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,307
You are cute as
A cuddly bear

19
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,506
You are soft
As a baby's sigh

20
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,674
You are my girl,
And I'm your guy

21
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,480
That's why I'm lovin' you
Lots and lots

00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,714
I'm just lovin' you
Lots and lots

00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:31,154
And I'm all tied up
In knots

24
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,988
I'm just lovin' you
Lots and lots

25
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,910
You got me all tied up
In knots

26
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:57,279
And I'm lovin' you
Lots and lots

27
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,682
I'm just lovin' you
Lots and lots

00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:02,220

Lovin' you lots and lots

Lovin' you
Lots and lots

31
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,626
Lovin' you

32
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:17,762
Lots and lots

33
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:16,629
Patterson's.

34
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,823
what's goin' on
Down there?

35
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:19,922
Dad?

36
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:21,796
Harriet priestly
Just called your mama.

37
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,460
Her husband
Drove by the store

38
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,969
And said the lights
Were still on.

39
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,132
What are the lights
Still doing on?

40
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,267
I'm cookin' the books
As usual, dad.

41
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,436
The sign, guy.
The sign is still on.

42
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,707
Are we open for business
All night now?

43
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:37,375
No. Sorry. I, uh,
I'll turn that right off.

44
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,112
Is that music playing on one
Of the store hi-fis?

45
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,585
I'll turn that
Right off, too.

46
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:44,054
"Turn that off, too."

47
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:54,793
Dang.

48
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,731
Ohh.

49
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,073
But I thought you
Already decided on the echoes.

50
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:07,271
Nah. Some band
In buffalo's the echoes.

51
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,008
Anyway, I wasn't
Wild about that.

52
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,379
Let's just...

53
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,044
Call us the...band
You're about to hear.

54
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,609
How 'bout
The corvettes?

55
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,178
Is that the corvettes
Or the chordvettes?

56
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,986
No. Corvettes,
Like the car.

57
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,923
Well, see, I was thinkin',
Like, the chord...

58
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,926
Chordvettes.
Like chords in our music.

59
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,967
No.

60
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,526
here you are.
That's 10 cents.

61
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,935
Is that
Skitch patterson?

62
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,598
- hi.
- hey there.
Mornin', everybody.

63
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:35,698
Mornin'.
Hey, guy.

64
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,436
Well, here we are.
Erie's lone beatnik.

65
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,477
Any others?

66
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,774
What about the tempos?
You know, tempos?

67
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,781
Not the tempos.
Tempos...

68
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,340
I was in a band already
Called the tempos.

69
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:46,851
We were...

70
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,181
Terrible.

71
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,654
Hey, guy, weren't
You the drummer in the tempos?

72
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:52,350
Heard that.

73
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,521
I keep comin' back
To the herdsmen.

74
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,086
How 'bout
The big tippers?

75
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,961
I like it.

76
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,435
Ok, skitch.

77
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,698
You wanna experience
Shame tonight?

78
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,400
We're playin' the mercyhurst
College talent show.

79
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:10,704
It's gonna be
Hilarious.

80
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:13,803
Jimmy and the herdsmen.

81
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,848
Chad gonna solo
On wipeout?

82
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:18,713
Oh, you know, every song
Is wipeout to chad.

83
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:19,774
Enjoy your breakfast.

84
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:20,841
See ya, faye.

85
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,012
I gotta pass,

86
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,579
But if you kids
Need any new wires or plugs,

87
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,783
Give me a call.

88
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,826
All right, well,
You're gonna miss it.

89
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,862
College giris, co-eds...
By the fistful.

90
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,591
Ooh, hey, my dad
Wants a roto-antenna.

91
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,792
Tell him to come by
The store.

92
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,836
He already talked
To a salesman at tele-mart.

93
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:40,099
That's a big mistake.

94
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,973
Lenny, those cats
Don't know squat about service.

95
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,780
Hey, hey, hey.
Lookin' good.

96
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,976
Hmm?

97
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:57,690
Morning.

98
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,850
Don't we open at 10:00
On saturdays?

99
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,360
Yes, we do.
And it's a good thing.

100
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,964
You know,
Like the flock that follows,

101
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,762
But it's like " herds"
With a e-a.

102
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:09,893
So it's like
Heardsmen,

103
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,766
- so it's one of
The six senses.
- right.

104
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,135
So it's spelled
Like that.

105
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,298
What do you
Think?

106
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,306
A big herd.

107
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,307
Heards.

108
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,468
I don't get it.

109
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,807
No, it's spelled like this,
So it's heards,

110
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,905
So it's one of the senses.
Music heards.

111
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,950
I don't-
I don't get it.

112
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,814
Yeah, do it.

113
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,148
Oh, heards,
Like hear.

114
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,550
Yes. It's, like,
Heardsmen.

115
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:32,784
Heardsmen.

116
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,453
Oh, no. Oh. Ow.

117
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:38,759
Guys.

118
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,799
Chad fell down.

119
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,832
Ok, venus?

120
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,959
Ok, steve.

121
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:43,967
Right.

122
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:45,469
Let's go.

123
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:51,502
Unh!

124
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,690
Oh, hey.

125
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:09,652
Look at this.

126
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:10,787
See this?

127
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,455
My grandma and i
Watched this.

128
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,159
Three weeks,
We've been watching it,

129
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,997
And last week, she realizes
There's strings.

130
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:19,162
They're puppets.

131
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:20,432
Yeah.

132
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,371
They're marionettes.
That's what they are.

133
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,069
What can I help you with
Today, gentlemen?

134
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:27,271
We have a big proposition
For you, guy.

135
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,405
You, uh, you still, uh,
Playing percussiÃ³n?

136
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,609
I told you he was,
Didn't I?

137
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:32,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

138
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,250
Every day.

139
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,022
We need you, skitch.

140
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,683
How 'bout sittin' in for chad,
Just for tonight.

141
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,391
Why?

142
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,487
Asshole...

143
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,226
Just broke his arm.

144
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:56,773
Let's check out these clock radios
Over here, huh?

145
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,071
Oh, yeah.

146
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:02,012
Would anyone notice
If chad busted his arm? Ha ha.

147
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:04,242
These are the clock radios,
Fellas.

148
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,982
So...what's this tune?

149
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:12,149
Well, it's an original
That I wrote.

150
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,249
Hey.

151
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,554
We wrote.

152
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,117
It's nothing
You can't handle.

153
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,322
It's just for tonight.

154
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:19,796
And if we win,

155
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,595
We split $100.

156
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:23,659
Um...

157
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:24,896
Wow.

158
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,668
Playin'
In a group again.

159
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,538
Man, that sounds
Like fun.

160
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,843
All right,
Here's the deal.

161
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,887
If you want
These magic hands,

162
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:44,752
You gotta buy two
New record needles.

163
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,190
And this radio.

164
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:52,962
Are you serious?

165
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,267
It's 14.95 on sale.

166
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,963
How 'bout
A washing machine, too?

167
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,665
Yeah, ok.

168
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:06,411
'Cause it hurts me so
Just to see you go

169
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:10,643
Around with someone new

170
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:15,278
And if I know you,
You're doin' that thing

171
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:19,848
And every day,
Just doin' that thing

172
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:25,728
I can't take you
Doin' that thing you do

173
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:33,933
Perfect, man.

174
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,270
Very good.
Took chad a week to learn that.

175
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:39,140
Chad. Who's ch-chad?

176
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,508
Just one song, right?

177
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,979
that's right.

178
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,447
One-derful.

179
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,445
I gotta go.

180
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,817
That's it...

181
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,118
Guy patterson.

182
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,851
That's it-
The one-ders!

183
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,758
And then, you know how,
Like the beatles-the beatles,

184
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,796
They use an e-a
As the beatles?

185
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:00,661
Well, we can use an o-n-e
Like the one-ders.

186
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,098
You're talkin'
Gibberish.

187
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,726
No, look.

188
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:06,835
The one-ders.

189
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:07,873
Lenny.

190
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,534
Yeah, it looks like
The o-neders.

191
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,840
No. The-the one-ders.

192
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,176
Got it. Looks like
The o-neders.

193
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:19,183
Oh, I can hear
The children laughing

194
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:22,812
I can hear
The children laughing

195
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:26,289
Yes, I hear
The children laughing

196
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,851
And it's not far

197
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:33,365
No, it's not
Far away

198
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:36,663
No, it's not far

199
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:40,695
And I hear
The river flowing

200
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,297
Yes, I hear...

201
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,572
Hey! You're drowning
In the river! You're drowning!

202
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,772
Hear the river flowing

203
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:51,146
And it's not far

204
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:54,744
No, it's not
Far away

205
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,620
No, it's not far

206
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,056
This is hardly
A date, guy.

207
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,991
I thought we were
Going to the movies

208
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,188
And dinner
At the club.

209
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,958
We're gonna cream
These ladies.

210
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,659
Well, how long
Is this going to be?

211
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,702
Guy, I've been looking for you
Everywhere. You got to set up.

212
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,998
Oh. Ok. Um...

213
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,095
Where are they?

214
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,434
Um,
Right straight back,

215
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,441
Through the door,
By the stage.

216
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,136
Great.
Tina, this is faye.

217
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,111
Hi. How long
Is this going to be?

218
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:23,678
Um...

219
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,683
You know,
I- I don't know.

220
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:29,187
I've never really been
To one of these things before.

221
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,952
Nice to meet you.

222
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:38,920
Whoo-whoo!

223
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,425
Cha cha cha!

224
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,896
all right, yeah!
Listen to that applause.

225
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:15,433
What do you say,
Miss talent show?

226
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,026
Extra good? No! Super!

227
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:23,432
Very good. That definitely
Makes the legends of brass

228
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,976
Of phi kappa epsilon

229
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,342
Way over there
At gannon college...

230
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,278
Our front-runners!

231
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,476
ok.

232
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,747
How are you, boys?
You-you ready?

233
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:36,810
No.

234
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,151
Emcee: oh, well.

235
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:42,024
Hey, how do you sell
A chicken to a deaf man?

236
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,026
You're
A jerkhead!

237
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,255
You say,
238
0:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,128
" hey, would you
Like to buy a chicken?!"

238
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,325
Eat my shorts,
Captain.

239
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,994
Shut up!
I'll kick your ass.

240
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,069
Are you ready?

241
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,110
Ready.

242
00:12:58,177 --> 00:12:59,769
Oh, yeah,
Just one, please.

243
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:00,937
Hi. Have fun.

244
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:03,504
this next group,
They're all locals.

245
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,709
They call erie home.

246
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,151
The...o-neders.

247
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,881
all right,
Let's go!

248
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,217
That's "the one-ders."

249
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,924
1, 2, 3, 4.

250
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,656
That's too fast,
Guy. Slow down!

251
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,992
Come on, come on.

252
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:22,158
Slow down! Too fast!
Slow it down!

253
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,861
You

254
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,905
Doin' that thing
You do

255
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,372
Aw, come on.
That's too fast.

256
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,932
Breakin' my heart
Into a million pieces

257
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:35,139
Like you always do

258
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,772
And you

259
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:40,012
Don't mean to be cruel

260
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,246
You never even knew

261
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,516
About the heartache

262
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,582
I've been
Goin' through

263
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,592
And I try...

264
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,061
Aw, come on,
Guy. Aw.

265
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,759
But it's just
So hard to do

266
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:59,931
Every time you do
That thing you do

267
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:02,734
I

268
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:06,073
Know all the games
You play

269
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:10,946
I'm gonna find a way
To let you know that

270
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,849
You'll be mine someday

271
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,819
'Cause we

272
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:19,119
Could be happy,
Can't you see?

273
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:24,060
If you'd only let me
Be the one to hold you

274
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,927
And keep you here
With me

275
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:30,298
Yes, I try and I try
To forget you, girl

276
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,338
But it's just
So hard to do

277
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:38,172
Every time you do
That thing you do

278
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,373
I...

279
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,472
Man, what's
Goin' on here?

280
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,244
No one...

281
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:46,579
It's all right!

282
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:47,949
You're a lucky man!

283
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,749
An unhappy guy, girl

284
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:54,316
And I just can't
Take it anymore

285
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,605
'Cause we

286
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:13,008
Could be happy,
Can't you see?

287
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:18,209
If you'd only let me
Be the one to hold you

288
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,253
And keep you here
With me

289
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,756
'Cause it hurts me so
Just to see you go

290
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:27,849
Around with someone new

291
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:32,264
And if I know you,
You're doin' that thing

292
00:15:32,397 --> 00:15:34,763
Every day,
Just doin' that thing

293
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:39,702
And I can't take you
Doin' that thing you do

294
00:15:43,408 --> 00:15:46,275
Oh, my goodness!

295
00:15:46,344 --> 00:15:47,470
That was fantastic!

296
00:15:47,545 --> 00:15:49,172
That was way
Too fast, man.

297
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,771
It's a ballad!

298
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:51,838
You're right.

299
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,248
No, it was great!
It was great!

300
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,545
Oh, that's wicked!

301
00:15:57,622 --> 00:15:59,351
That's sure wicked!

302
00:15:59,424 --> 00:16:03,019
The o-neders
Are the champions!

303
00:16:03,094 --> 00:16:06,495
Because they do
That thing you do!

304
00:16:06,564 --> 00:16:08,259
That was great!
That was great, you guys!

305
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,960
Come over here.
I wanna talk to you.

306
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,229
You ever been
To villapiano's?

307
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,203
What, the spaghetti place
Out by the airport

308
00:16:13,271 --> 00:16:14,465
That's been
In the papers?

309
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:16,473
Yeah. I gotta have ya.
I just gotta have ya.

310
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,202
I want you playin'
At my place next weekend.

311
00:16:18,276 --> 00:16:19,709
What do you say, huh?

312
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,405
will there
Be money involved?

313
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:23,344
I'll pay you 100 bucks.
How's that?

314
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:24,677
we'll do it.

315
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:27,582
Yeah! Yeah, yeah!

316
00:16:30,288 --> 00:16:31,346
Ooh!

317
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:35,220
I don't know.

318
00:16:35,293 --> 00:16:38,160
It's like I could hear
The beat in my head, you know.

319
00:16:39,864 --> 00:16:40,853
Pull over!

320
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:43,059
Hey! You guys are wicked!

321
00:16:43,134 --> 00:16:44,567
You even drive
Too fast!

322
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,797
What are you doin' with him?
He's a drummer!

323
00:16:46,871 --> 00:16:47,860
Hey, one-ders!

324
00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:49,099
- whoo!
- whoo!

325
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,608
I don't know.
I haven't played in front of people

326
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:53,303
In so long,
So I was nervous.

327
00:16:53,378 --> 00:16:54,743
But it sounds
Better fast.

328
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:57,077
Jimmy wanted it slow,
But he was wrong.

329
00:16:57,148 --> 00:16:58,945
It's an up-tempo number.

330
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:00,382
And we won!

331
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:03,353
Thatjimmy fella
Certainly has a gal pal in faye.

332
00:17:03,421 --> 00:17:04,888
They make
A cute couple, huh?

333
00:17:04,956 --> 00:17:07,015
The only other band I was in
Was my uncle's band.

334
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:09,117
We played this wedding for free,
And then we broke up.

335
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,889
This one gets a paying gig.

336
00:17:10,962 --> 00:17:14,295
So, what are you
Doin' next weekend?

337
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,526
Are you kidding?

338
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,194
I'm gonna see my boyfriend's
Music group.

339
00:17:18,269 --> 00:17:20,100
Award-winning
Music group.

340
00:17:20,171 --> 00:17:22,435
Yeah, and you're playing
At a restaurant

341
00:17:22,507 --> 00:17:23,940
Out by the...airport?

342
00:17:24,008 --> 00:17:26,442
Villapiano's.

343
00:17:44,629 --> 00:17:48,656
And when i
Close my eyes

344
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:53,033
You'll be
Right by my side

345
00:17:53,104 --> 00:17:57,837
If I could have
Just one request

346
00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:59,968
Stay with me, girl

347
00:18:00,044 --> 00:18:02,205
i confess

348
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:10,551
All my lone...ly
Dreams

349
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:24,827
Thank you.

350
00:18:27,305 --> 00:18:30,069
Table 19,
Your pizza's ready.

351
00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:39,775
Hey, when are you gonna play
That thing you do?

352
00:18:39,851 --> 00:18:41,478
That's what we
Wanna hear!

353
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,384
Uh, has our fame
Preceded us?

354
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,286
Hey, we came here
To meet giris and dance,

355
00:18:45,356 --> 00:18:47,221
And we can't meet giris
Until we dance!

356
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,318
All right, this is an opportune time
To pick it up a little.

357
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:53,592
All right, here's one
For the kid in the back.

358
00:18:54,966 --> 00:18:56,092
Let's dance!

359
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,394
You

360
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,498
Doin' that thing
You do

361
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:09,411
Breakin' my heart
Into a million pieces

362
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,142
Like you...

363
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,612
Let it burn.
Let her burn.

364
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,279
Let her burn all night.

365
00:19:17,355 --> 00:19:19,721
Bring me out here in the doggone
Middle of the night

366
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,622
To turn off the light.

367
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,593
Can't he ever
Get anything right?

368
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:27,062
"Oh, no. No, dad,
I'll-i'll be sure
To turn the lights off."

369
00:19:27,131 --> 00:19:29,224
Hell, he couldn't
Turn a light off at the house.

370
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,461
Why would he ever
Turn one off down here at the store?

371
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:36,606
Know what that is?

372
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:39,876
Presidential
Flash cards?

373
00:19:39,944 --> 00:19:41,468
A bonus.

374
00:19:41,546 --> 00:19:42,911
Do you know why?

375
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:45,381
I have no idea.

376
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,849
To entice you back.

377
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:48,749
The word is out
On you o-neders.

378
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,412
Hey,
That's o-nedders.

379
00:19:50,488 --> 00:19:52,422
The door went up
On your second set tonight.

380
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,118
People were callin' their friends
To come down to villapiano's.

381
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:56,160
Yeah?

382
00:19:56,227 --> 00:19:58,161
I'm gonna make
A fortune off you.

383
00:19:58,229 --> 00:20:01,323
I tell you- hey, don't even bother
With the fake i.d.s.

384
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:03,299
Villapiano's is closed.
Lance! Lance.

385
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,835
Like, so whatever
Happened to tina?

386
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:06,894
Um, she had
To help her mom

387
00:20:06,971 --> 00:20:09,565
With a tupperware party,
Making food.

388
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:12,610
Well, she better get herself
Down here next time,

389
00:20:12,677 --> 00:20:15,271
'Cause all the giris
Were talking about you guys

390
00:20:15,346 --> 00:20:16,335
In the bathroom.

391
00:20:16,414 --> 00:20:17,881
Yeah?

392
00:20:17,949 --> 00:20:19,610
I almost slugged some girl
Called chrissy.

393
00:20:19,684 --> 00:20:21,618
- chrissy thompkins?
- short brown hair.

394
00:20:21,686 --> 00:20:23,813
Wait. What did I miss?
Who is she?

395
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:27,085
Oh, gray polka-dot dress,
Nursing a beer,

396
00:20:27,158 --> 00:20:28,420
Over by the photo-booth.

397
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:29,619
Stayed for both sets.

398
00:20:29,694 --> 00:20:31,787
Wait. Where was I?

399
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,797
Oh, playing songs
On my guitar.

400
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,765
Here you go, kids.
On the house.

401
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,460
She had her eye
On myjimmy.

402
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:40,060
Hey, three stooges,
Come on, out.

403
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:43,266
She had some fine things to say
About our drummer as well, though.

404
00:20:43,341 --> 00:20:45,935
- get out. What'd she say?
- I don't know.

405
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,500
Hey, guys. I don't
Mean to interrupt.

406
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,638
I just wanna say that,
Uh, love your song, love that music.

407
00:20:49,714 --> 00:20:51,147
I wanna know where I can
Get the record.

408
00:20:51,215 --> 00:20:52,443
- outside.
- hey, pops!

409
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,451
Pops? I'll give you a pop.

410
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,680
Hey, wasn't
That our fan?

411
00:20:58,856 --> 00:21:01,450
Hey, what do you guys
Think about that?

412
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:02,720
what?

413
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,785
Maybe we should
Make a record.

414
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:06,591
Like, actually
Make a record.

415
00:21:06,664 --> 00:21:07,926
A record-record
Record?

416
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:09,591
Yeah,
That's what I mean.

417
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:11,032
Not one
That we'd play.

418
00:21:11,102 --> 00:21:12,831
Yeah, I mean, we could, like,
Sell copies of them right here

419
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,132
For a buck apiece.

420
00:21:14,205 --> 00:21:16,969
There's a sound booth
At tele-mart that we could use.

421
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,633
No, that's for,
Like, two people.

422
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,177
That's for
Birthday greetings.

423
00:21:20,244 --> 00:21:21,609
You're talkin'
To spartacus here.

424
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,944
I happen to have a relative
In the record industry.

425
00:21:25,016 --> 00:21:26,449
Ooh. Uncle bob?

426
00:21:26,517 --> 00:21:28,041
Uncle-
Who's uncle bob?

427
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:30,849
He records church music.

428
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,981
Choirs, favorite sermons,

429
00:21:33,057 --> 00:21:34,684
Stuff my mom listens to.

430
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:36,852
So could he
Record our music?

431
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:37,860
maybe.

432
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,362
Wouldn't do it
For free.

433
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,864
And we'd have to
Watch our language.

434
00:21:43,801 --> 00:21:45,359
Wah!

435
00:21:58,716 --> 00:22:00,479
'Cause we

436
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:03,987
Could be happy,
Can't you see?

437
00:22:04,055 --> 00:22:09,687
If you'd only let me
Be the one to hold you

438
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:13,197
And keep you here
With me

439
00:22:13,264 --> 00:22:16,927
'Cause it hurts me so
Just to see you go

440
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:20,232
Around with someone new

441
00:22:20,304 --> 00:22:24,104
And if I know you,
You're doin' that thing

442
00:22:24,175 --> 00:22:27,611
Every day,
Just doin' that thing

443
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,707
And I can't take you
Doin' that thing you do

444
00:22:39,957 --> 00:22:41,652
That was swingin', man!

445
00:22:41,726 --> 00:22:42,750
- swingin'?
- swingin'!

446
00:22:42,827 --> 00:22:44,454
That's good, right?
Swingin' is good?

447
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,588
I think
It was still too fast.

448
00:22:46,664 --> 00:22:48,825
Thank you, uncle bob.
Thank you very, very much.

449
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,527
Say hi
To your dad for me.

450
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:51,693
You got it.

451
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:53,634
Hey, what about
All my own dreams?

452
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,799
I got to be in buffalo
At 7:00 to record a children's choir.

453
00:22:56,874 --> 00:22:59,069
I only got
That one take.

454
00:22:59,143 --> 00:23:02,806
Hey, uncle bob, when are we gonna
Get these records?

455
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,371
Uh...

456
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,213
Luke 21:19.

457
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:09,879
"And your patience
Possess ye your souls."

458
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:12,313
Luke? Who's luke?

459
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,688
When are we
Gettin' the record?

460
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:16,192
Wednesday.

461
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,156
come on!
Come on!

462
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:22,495
Hey, these are
The o-neders?

463
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,660
No. It's the one-ders.

464
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,567
The one-ders. O-n-e.

465
00:23:26,637 --> 00:23:28,867
- but the band is
Playing here tonight?
- yeah.

466
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,635
- they made a record?
- yeah.

467
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:31,675
Neat-o.

468
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,335
Here, your change.
Thank you.

469
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:35,606
so you mean,
You can see me from up there?

470
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,272
Oh, crystal clearly.

471
00:23:37,348 --> 00:23:39,373
You've been here
Every night.

472
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:42,112
You know, you guys
Are way better than anything.

473
00:23:42,186 --> 00:23:44,279
I told my parents I was going over
To my friends'-

474
00:23:44,355 --> 00:23:46,516
Bobbie and joanne-
To study, but I didn't.

475
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,990
I came here, instead.

476
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,425
I'm stooping to subterfuge
For you guys.

477
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:51,723
Hoo hoo. Subter-

478
00:23:51,796 --> 00:23:52,820
Hey, uh, skitch,

479
00:23:52,897 --> 00:23:55,491
Your girlfriend
Just walked in the door.

480
00:23:57,235 --> 00:24:00,534
Oh, great.
Tina made it.

481
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,129
I'll handle this.
Don't worry.

482
00:24:02,206 --> 00:24:03,195
Thanks.

483
00:24:03,274 --> 00:24:05,003
Hi. I'm lenny.

484
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:06,065
Hi.

485
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,839
What's your name?

486
00:24:07,912 --> 00:24:08,810
Chrissy.

487
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,610
T. Hey. You came!

488
00:24:11,682 --> 00:24:12,876
As promised.

489
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:13,848
Hey!

490
00:24:13,918 --> 00:24:15,579
And look.
New dancing shoes.

491
00:24:15,653 --> 00:24:17,553
Ah. You look great.

492
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,614
Yeah, he's got a very
Pretty girlfriend, doesn't he?

493
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:22,625
Is it serious,
Do you know?

494
00:24:22,693 --> 00:24:25,491
Very serious.
I'm single.

495
00:24:25,563 --> 00:24:27,258
What about
The bass player?

496
00:24:27,331 --> 00:24:29,196
He's married.

497
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:31,201
Is it always
This smoky?

498
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:32,964
Hey, ringo,
It's showtime.

499
00:24:33,037 --> 00:24:36,131
Come on, you should've
Been on five minutes ago.

500
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:51,953
With them, I feel like
I'm wastin' my time

501
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:55,550
And you make me feel
Like I'm losin' my mind

502
00:24:55,626 --> 00:24:59,722
Little wild

503
00:24:59,797 --> 00:25:00,889
Queen

504
00:25:01,966 --> 00:25:06,699
My little wild

505
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:08,238
One

506
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,932
Oh, I left
My girl, fine

507
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:17,447
But then I need you
All the time

508
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:18,982
Little wild one

509
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,381
I'll come back

510
00:25:20,451 --> 00:25:21,713
I'll take one.

511
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:23,515
Little wild one,
I'll come back

512
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:25,579
Sellin' a lot of these?

513
00:25:25,656 --> 00:25:28,523
I'll come back

514
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:29,992
Thank you.

515
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:36,762
To you

516
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:48,110
Thank you, erie, p-a!

517
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,549
Let me see that paper.

518
00:25:58,956 --> 00:26:01,823
Let's see what tele-mart's
Up to here today.

519
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,453
Full page, of course.

520
00:26:04,528 --> 00:26:06,189
Oh, get this.

521
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:08,494
Barbecue grills.
They got barbecue grills now.

522
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:09,760
For 7.89.

523
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:11,734
Good lord.

524

Oh, here's-
Here's somethin'.

Look here.

526
00:26:14,939 --> 00:26:16,770
Shoe-polisher kit.

527
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:19,469
People can't even
Get a brush and a rag out

528
00:26:19,543 --> 00:26:20,874
And shine
Their shoes anymore.

529
00:26:20,945 --> 00:26:22,845
They gotta have
A shoe-polisher kit.

530
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,211
Man, oh, man.

531
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:27,308
" portable radio, 8.88.

532
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:29,945

10:00-10:00.

533
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:33,218
Sunday, 12:00-6:00."

534
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:36,192
Open on sunday
From 12:00-6:00.

535
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,285
You know, I don't believe
I wanna live in a country

536
00:26:38,362 --> 00:26:40,990
Where you have
To stay open on sunday

537
00:26:41,065 --> 00:26:42,191
To do business.

538
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:43,995
You shouldn't have
To work on sunday

539
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:45,501
To support a family,
Should you?

540
00:26:45,569 --> 00:26:46,536
No, no. Hmm?

541
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:47,832
Let's put
That paper away.

542
00:26:47,905 --> 00:26:49,270
Let's just
Take that right now.

543
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,807
Yeah, let's get it
Out of here.

544
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:53,742
Ok, let's get to work. Guy,
Quit fiddling around with those records

545
00:26:53,811 --> 00:26:55,073
Up there in the window.

546
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:58,115
We're not selling
Records here, are we? Are we, mama?

547
00:26:58,182 --> 00:27:00,082
This is an appliance store,
I believe.

548
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:01,379
It's called
Patterson's appliances.

549
00:27:01,452 --> 00:27:03,386
Come on in. We're open.

550
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:07,655
Can I help you?

551
00:27:07,725 --> 00:27:09,989
Y-you're the drummer,
Aren't ya?

552
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:12,393
Of that group I heard
Last night, uh...

553
00:27:12,463 --> 00:27:14,192
Uh, uh,
Down at villapiano's.

554
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:15,857
Yes, I am.

555
00:27:17,835 --> 00:27:19,325
Phil horace.

556
00:27:19,403 --> 00:27:20,893
Guy patterson.

557
00:27:23,507 --> 00:27:27,273
Do you wanna buy one of our records?
They're on sale.

558
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:30,007
I don't wanna waste
Any more of your time.

559
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:31,878
Would you step
Into my office, please?

560
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:36,952
You know, guy...

561
00:27:37,021 --> 00:27:40,081
One of the good things about your group
Is there's a nice...

562
00:27:40,157 --> 00:27:42,591
Natural, raw quality.

563
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,128
I like that.

564
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:46,390
Thank you.

565
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:48,932
And I wanna tell you,
I've been around.

566
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,195
And I think this...

567
00:27:51,268 --> 00:27:52,997
Is a hit record.

568
00:27:54,438 --> 00:27:58,465
And I found that a hit record
Is like a stew.

569
00:27:58,542 --> 00:28:01,238
All the ingredients
Have to cook together just right.

570
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:03,212
Otherwise, it's just soup.

571
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:07,448
Not too early in the day
For one of these, I hope.

572
00:28:07,518 --> 00:28:08,450
I'm thirsty.

573
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:10,544
I'm not sure about this.

574
00:28:10,621 --> 00:28:12,054
It's a standard
Management contract.

575
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:15,024
It says if I do my job,
You guys make money.

576
00:28:15,092 --> 00:28:16,559
How do we make money?

577
00:28:16,627 --> 00:28:19,027
Yeah, how? You gonna wrangle us
Up some dances

578
00:28:19,096 --> 00:28:21,530
At roller rinks,
Youth for christ jamborees-

579
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:26,400
Rock 'n' roll shows in steubenville,
Youngstown, pittsburgh,

580
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,869
Places like that.

581
00:28:27,938 --> 00:28:30,372
- really?
- yeah.
- pittsburgh?

582
00:28:30,441 --> 00:28:31,373
Steubenville.

583
00:28:31,442 --> 00:28:33,307
Yeah.

584
00:28:33,377 --> 00:28:37,643
And how would you like to hear
That thing you do on the radio?

585
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:38,909
I'd love to.

586
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:40,541
Um, sure.

587
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:42,586
Well, then,
Leave it to me.

588
00:28:42,653 --> 00:28:44,086
And here's your guarantee.

589
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:46,055
If I don't get
This record going,

590
00:28:46,123 --> 00:28:47,818
And I mean serious radio airplay
Inside of a week-

591
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,257
10 days at the most-

592
00:28:49,326 --> 00:28:50,759
We'll tear this up.

593
00:28:50,828 --> 00:28:53,661
I'm no longer your manager.

594
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:55,164
I don't know.

595
00:28:55,232 --> 00:28:57,200
I'm reluctant
To sign anything

596
00:28:57,268 --> 00:29:00,101
That has to do
With my music.

597
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:01,604
What, are you crazy?

598
00:29:01,672 --> 00:29:05,540
A man in a really nice camper
Wants to put our song on the radio.

599
00:29:05,609 --> 00:29:07,008
Give me a pen.

600
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,842
I'm signing, you're signing,
We're all signing.

601
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,075
Hey, do you have
Something to drink besides juice?

602
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:15,209
Yeah, I think there's some
Soda pop under that blanket.

603
00:29:26,263 --> 00:29:28,060
The swelling will go down
In a couple of days.

604
00:29:28,132 --> 00:29:30,566
Put cold compresses,
20 minutes at a time, all right?

605
00:29:30,634 --> 00:29:32,568
I'll see you in
A couple of days.

606
00:29:32,636 --> 00:29:34,501
Your new patient,
Tina powers, is here.

607
00:29:37,141 --> 00:29:39,166
Hi, are you tina?

608
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:47,617
Tina? Yes.

609
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:49,482
Yes, I'm tina.

610
00:30:04,701 --> 00:30:07,261
You see those ladies
Over by the stove?

611
00:30:09,672 --> 00:30:12,607
Get that thing
Out of your ear and get over here.

612
00:30:12,675 --> 00:30:15,143
And put the hamburger away.
You can eat anytime.

613
00:30:15,211 --> 00:30:16,269
Come on!

614
00:30:18,181 --> 00:30:19,443
Hi, ladies.

615
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:28,523

With drive faster.

616
00:30:28,591 --> 00:30:31,219
Wj et hit-time,
10 minutes past the hour.

617
00:30:31,294 --> 00:30:32,693
Hey, here's something new.

618
00:30:32,762 --> 00:30:34,696
A local erie band's
Got a new record out.

619
00:30:34,764 --> 00:30:36,698
Just won the mercyhurst
Talent show a couple of weeks ago.

620
00:30:36,766 --> 00:30:39,098
This is erie's own...
The one-ders!

621
00:30:39,168 --> 00:30:40,601
Oh, my god!

622

623
00:30:43,673 --> 00:30:47,404
Doin' that thing
You do

624
00:30:47,477 --> 00:30:51,345
Breakin' my heart
Into a million pieces

625
00:30:56,452 --> 00:30:58,784
Aah! We're
On the radio!

626
00:30:58,855 --> 00:31:01,255
The radio's playing
That thing you do!

627
00:31:01,324 --> 00:31:03,053
- aah!
- aah!

628
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,161
Even knew
About the heartache

629
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:10,597
- aah!
- aah!

630
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:12,964
I try and try
To forget you

631
00:31:13,035 --> 00:31:16,471
Comes in beige,
Classic white,

632
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:17,471
Avocado...

633
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,438
- aah!
- aah!

634
00:31:18,508 --> 00:31:20,100
Oh, my god!

635
00:31:21,144 --> 00:31:22,611
Guy!

636
00:31:22,678 --> 00:31:25,772
Guy! Turn on the radio!
They're playing it!

637
00:31:35,057 --> 00:31:36,490
Ok. Turn it on.

638
00:31:38,895 --> 00:31:43,161
'Cause I try and try
To forget you

639
00:31:43,232 --> 00:31:47,100
But it's just
So hard to do

640
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:49,138
Every time

641
00:31:49,205 --> 00:31:52,538
Son, you wanna get your
Cotton-pickin' mitts off that!

642
00:31:52,608 --> 00:31:54,872
Yeah!

643
00:31:54,944 --> 00:31:57,640
I don't ask around, girl

644
00:31:57,713 --> 00:32:01,149
So I know one thing's
For sure

645
00:32:19,302 --> 00:32:21,770
Did you hear it?

646
00:32:21,838 --> 00:32:23,772
Huh? Yeah.

647
00:32:28,377 --> 00:32:30,902
Yes! We're on the radio!

648
00:32:44,794 --> 00:32:49,390
Put that down.
That is a very expensive floor display.

649
00:32:49,465 --> 00:32:51,126
Patterson's appliances.

650
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:53,068
What?

651
00:32:53,135 --> 00:32:56,070
Yes! We're listening
To it right now!

652
00:32:56,138 --> 00:32:57,765
Yes!

653
00:33:01,143 --> 00:33:03,077
I am spartacus!

654
00:33:06,949 --> 00:33:10,350
Oh, I can't believe
I missed it.

655
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:14,981
Well, it played 3 times...
This afternoon.

656
00:33:15,057 --> 00:33:16,354
So you said.

657
00:33:16,425 --> 00:33:19,758
But it's not like I haven't
Heard your song, guy.

658
00:33:19,829 --> 00:33:20,796
I have.

659
00:33:20,863 --> 00:33:22,524
You know what?

660
00:33:22,598 --> 00:33:25,066
There's a big
Rock 'n' roll show

661
00:33:25,134 --> 00:33:26,567
This weekend
In pittsburgh.

662
00:33:26,636 --> 00:33:28,035
Guess who's playing?

663
00:33:28,104 --> 00:33:29,901
Oh, this weekend.

664
00:33:29,972 --> 00:33:32,406
You will not believe
What I have to do.

665
00:33:32,475 --> 00:33:35,342
I'm getting the crown replaced
On my number 15 molar.

666
00:33:35,411 --> 00:33:38,744
It's-it's like gonna
Take all day tomorrow with the dentist.

667
00:33:38,814 --> 00:33:40,111
All day?

668
00:33:40,182 --> 00:33:41,706
At the dentist?

669
00:33:41,784 --> 00:33:42,716
Mm-hmm.

00:33:42,785 --> 00:33:45,219
You're gonna miss
2,000 screaming fans

00:35:38,701 --> 00:35:42,467
Which reminds me,
How're you sleeping?

709
00:35:44,873 --> 00:35:47,364
Who's gonna hit me?

710
00:35:47,443 --> 00:35:48,375
Hit me!
Hit me!

711
00:35:48,444 --> 00:35:49,376
You gonna hit me?

712
00:35:49,445 --> 00:35:50,377
- hit me!
- hit me!

713
00:35:50,446 --> 00:35:51,378
Who's gonna hit me?

714
00:35:51,447 --> 00:35:52,414
- hit me!
- hit me!

715
00:35:52,481 --> 00:35:54,381
All right! Let's go!

716
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:57,146
We gotjon d
And the walkers.

717
00:35:57,219 --> 00:35:58,618
We got the hollyhocks.

718
00:35:58,687 --> 00:36:03,147
We got the vicksburgs
In pittsburgh.

719
00:36:03,225 --> 00:36:06,661
But first it's time to fix that solid
Not broken heart

720
00:36:06,729 --> 00:36:08,594
If we're gonna shake, bake,
And make

721
00:36:08,664 --> 00:36:13,761
With lake erie's own...
The o-neders.

722
00:36:20,843 --> 00:36:24,108
Fire one up. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

723
00:36:25,314 --> 00:36:27,578
Thank you.

724
00:36:27,649 --> 00:36:29,048
Hey, hey!

725
00:36:29,118 --> 00:36:30,608
The mike's not on.

726
00:36:30,686 --> 00:36:32,677
We-the mike's
Not working.

727
00:36:32,755 --> 00:36:34,188
The mike's not working.

728
00:36:34,256 --> 00:36:35,917
All right. Who am I not paying
Back here? Come on.

729
00:36:35,991 --> 00:36:37,356
let's here it.
Come on!

730
00:36:40,996 --> 00:36:43,965
come on!

731
00:36:51,907 --> 00:36:52,839
Thank you.

732
00:36:52,908 --> 00:36:54,000
Thank you.

733
00:36:54,076 --> 00:36:55,543
We're the one-ders.

734
00:36:55,611 --> 00:36:58,011
Would you play some
Friggin' music? Come on!

735
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,104
All right.

736
00:36:59,181 --> 00:37:00,239
1...

737
00:37:00,315 --> 00:37:01,714
2...

738
00:37:07,623 --> 00:37:10,717
Forget it.
Let's go. Let's go.

739
00:37:11,627 --> 00:37:12,753
Let's go.

740
00:37:12,828 --> 00:37:14,159
Right now!

741
00:37:23,772 --> 00:37:26,206
Look, guy,
I keep telling ya.

742
00:37:26,275 --> 00:37:27,674
You are the drummer.

743
00:37:27,743 --> 00:37:29,176
You're the backbone,
The timekeeper.

744
00:37:29,244 --> 00:37:32,702
You can't let a tepid reaction
From one matinee house

745
00:37:32,781 --> 00:37:35,181
Affect your dedication
To the band.

746
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,686
I was playing like one of those
Wind-up monkey toys.

747
00:37:38,754 --> 00:37:40,688
They booed us
Off the stage.

748
00:37:40,756 --> 00:37:43,691
Jimmy couldn't even hear
How off-key he was.

749
00:37:43,759 --> 00:37:45,317
You're gonna get it all back tonight,
I promise you.

750
00:37:45,394 --> 00:37:47,362
You know what you need?

751
00:37:47,429 --> 00:37:50,364
You need to sample
The exotic cuisine of the far east.

752
00:37:50,432 --> 00:37:52,900
What do you say?
Come on. I'm buying.

753
00:37:59,775 --> 00:38:02,801
Well, son of a gun.
We're right on time.

754
00:38:02,878 --> 00:38:04,812
Here's somebody
I want you to meet.

755
00:38:06,815 --> 00:38:09,511
Mr. White...

756
00:38:09,585 --> 00:38:10,552
This is guy patterson.

757
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:11,551
Hi.

758
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,951
Sit down.

759
00:38:13,021 --> 00:38:16,354
Mr. White is with
Play-tone records.

760
00:38:16,425 --> 00:38:18,825
He just happened to be
In town this week,

761
00:38:18,894 --> 00:38:21,328
And he caught the show
This afternoon.

762
00:38:21,396 --> 00:38:22,294
Oh, great.

763
00:38:22,364 --> 00:38:23,388
Nevertheless,

764
00:38:23,465 --> 00:38:26,798
I think he wants to talk
Business with you.

765
00:38:28,136 --> 00:38:31,196
Well, I have heard
Your record, guy, and I like it.

766
00:38:31,273 --> 00:38:32,706
I like it a lot.

767
00:38:32,774 --> 00:38:35,174
That thing you do,
You know, it's snappy.

768
00:38:35,244 --> 00:38:36,211
Yeah, snappy.

769
00:38:36,278 --> 00:38:37,711
It's a hit record.

770
00:38:37,779 --> 00:38:40,247
We'd like to release it.

771
00:38:40,315 --> 00:38:42,579
And add the one-ders...

772
00:38:42,651 --> 00:38:45,381
To the play-tone stable
Of artists.

773
00:38:52,494 --> 00:38:54,189
Just like that.

774
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:57,764
Well, some papers
Will have to be signed,

775
00:38:57,833 --> 00:39:00,802
And you'll have to get me
The master recording tapes,

776
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:04,703
And you will have to say
Good-bye to phil here.

777
00:39:04,773 --> 00:39:06,741
Wait. No.
Phil's our manager.

778
00:39:06,808 --> 00:39:07,740
Not anymore.

779
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:10,209
My bird-dogging is done.

780
00:39:10,279 --> 00:39:12,713
Play-tone's gonna take
Real good care of you.

781
00:39:12,781 --> 00:39:16,182
Uh, what if we don't
Wanna be with play-tone?

782
00:39:16,251 --> 00:39:19,584
I don't know, no offense.

783
00:39:19,655 --> 00:39:21,054
None taken.

784
00:39:21,123 --> 00:39:22,556
You want to stay
In pittsburgh

785
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,558
And play to the
Three rivers crowd,

786
00:39:24,626 --> 00:39:26,059
Phil here
Is your man.

787
00:39:26,128 --> 00:39:27,459
No, no.
Wait a minute.

788
00:39:27,529 --> 00:39:29,463
Wait a minute.

789
00:39:29,531 --> 00:39:30,964
Guy...

790
00:39:31,033 --> 00:39:34,901
Play-tone has a show
Touring state fairs.

791
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:37,404
This is the big time.
The full bore.

792
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,440
This is
A rock 'n' roll tour

793
00:39:39,508 --> 00:39:40,941
That will feature
The one-ders

794
00:39:41,009 --> 00:39:43,603
Provided you quit sitting
On your brain.

795
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,671
We'd be on tour?

796
00:39:46,748 --> 00:39:47,840
Yeah!

797
00:39:47,916 --> 00:39:49,611
A tour?

798
00:39:49,685 --> 00:39:53,644
With other stars
Of the play-tone galaxy.

799
00:39:56,692 --> 00:39:59,092
I have to talk this over
With the rest of the band.

800
00:40:01,964 --> 00:40:03,397
See what I mean?

801
00:40:03,465 --> 00:40:04,864
Smart.

802
00:40:04,933 --> 00:40:07,060
Very good.

803
00:40:07,135 --> 00:40:11,299
Next...this one-ders
With the o-n-e...

804
00:40:11,373 --> 00:40:12,499
It doesn't work.

805
00:40:12,574 --> 00:40:13,802
It's confusing.

806
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:16,810
From now on you boys
Will just be simply the wonders.

807
00:40:16,878 --> 00:40:20,279
As in I wonder what happened
To the o-neders?

808
00:40:20,349 --> 00:40:21,407
That's right.

809
00:40:21,483 --> 00:40:23,576
Play-tone will release
The record nationally,

810
00:40:23,652 --> 00:40:26,212
But you'll be doing
An awful lot of promoting as we go,

811
00:40:26,288 --> 00:40:27,619
So be prepared.

812
00:40:27,689 --> 00:40:29,486
All my only dreams
Is on the " b" side?

813
00:40:29,558 --> 00:40:30,786
Mm-hmm.

814
00:40:30,859 --> 00:40:33,657
We only got one take of that
When we did that in church.

815
00:40:33,729 --> 00:40:35,128
Could we re-record that?

816
00:40:35,197 --> 00:40:38,132
I don't think so.
I think it's great just the way it is.

817
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,134
We are gonna get you
Some new clothes.

818
00:40:40,202 --> 00:40:41,635
Matching suits,
Nice suits.

819
00:40:41,703 --> 00:40:43,671
Nice, because
You are nice boys.

820
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:45,138
Except maybe
For you.

821
00:40:45,207 --> 00:40:48,142
So when do we cut
Our next record?

822
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:51,145
Touring is the priority,
Um,jimmy.

823
00:40:51,213 --> 00:40:54,148
We're gonna meet up with the rest
Of the play-tone gang

824
00:40:54,216 --> 00:40:56,684
In columbus as soon
As possible.

825
00:40:56,752 --> 00:40:59,550
You'll be out on the road with them
Until labor day.

826
00:40:59,621 --> 00:41:00,645
Not me.

827
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,714
Is this a mutiny
Already?

828
00:41:03,792 --> 00:41:06,420
No, see, um...

829
00:41:07,663 --> 00:41:10,097
Well, I joined the united states
Marine corps

830
00:41:10,165 --> 00:41:11,598
Back at home.
So, um...

831
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:14,602
I have to report to south carolina
At the end of august,

832
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:17,104
Which means I have
To leave the band

833
00:41:17,172 --> 00:41:18,935
At the end of august.

834
00:41:21,209 --> 00:41:25,612
But you will stay with the band
Until the end of august?

835
00:41:25,681 --> 00:41:27,672
Yes, sir.

836
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:35,050
Ok, next, uh...
Who is faye?

837
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:38,591
Uh...

838
00:41:39,695 --> 00:41:42,994
Faye's sort of, uh,
Like my girlfriend.

839
00:41:43,065 --> 00:41:45,033
Oh, that is
So sweet.

840
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,499
You want her
On tour?

841
00:41:46,568 --> 00:41:47,899
She's your
Costume mistress.

842
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:52,133
All right, boys, do better tonight
Than you did today.

843
00:41:52,207 --> 00:41:54,641
I'm gonna go up
And have a chat

844
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,143
With boss vic
Kosslovitch,

845
00:41:56,211 --> 00:41:58,179
Make sure your mikes work
This time.

846
00:41:58,246 --> 00:41:59,304
Ah! Guy...

847
00:42:01,616 --> 00:42:03,743
See what the worid looks
Like through those.

848
00:42:03,819 --> 00:42:04,877
And you...

849
00:42:13,361 --> 00:42:16,262
Percussionist foster grant.

850
00:42:16,331 --> 00:42:18,765
Well, you're an adult,
So go on.

851
00:42:18,834 --> 00:42:20,768
Go on off then and bang
On your bongo drums as long as you like.

852
00:42:20,836 --> 00:42:22,770
It's for the summer, dad.
I'll drop you a line.

853
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:24,806
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Yeah, yeah. You do that.

854
00:42:24,873 --> 00:42:26,306
Tell mom I love her.

855
00:42:26,374 --> 00:42:27,773
I'll tell her.

856
00:42:29,478 --> 00:42:30,467
Well, mama,

857
00:42:30,545 --> 00:42:31,978
Your son
Who loves you

858
00:42:32,047 --> 00:42:33,981
Just left us
In the lurch.

859
00:42:34,049 --> 00:42:36,017
Darlene, you just
Got promoted.

860
00:42:36,084 --> 00:42:38,018
You mean, you're gonna
Start paying me?

861
00:42:38,086 --> 00:42:39,348
I didn't say that.

862
00:42:39,421 --> 00:42:41,855
Oh, hi, folks.
How're you doing today?

863
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:50,790
Hey, isn't it about time
You got going?

864
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:57,939
Special moment
For any recording artist.

865
00:42:58,006 --> 00:42:59,166
It's our record!

866
00:42:59,241 --> 00:43:00,173
Wow!

867
00:43:00,242 --> 00:43:01,937
Wow.

868
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:03,307
Wow, wow, wow!

869
00:43:03,378 --> 00:43:05,812
Ooh! It's got a hole in it.

870
00:43:05,881 --> 00:43:07,815
It's got grooves.
It's a play-tone record!

871
00:43:07,883 --> 00:43:10,010
Hey, you're missing somebody, guy.
Where's your bass player?

872
00:43:10,085 --> 00:43:13,077
Oh, he went sniffing around
The chantrellines' bus.

873
00:43:13,155 --> 00:43:14,952
Guess he's trying
To get a glimpse.

874
00:43:15,023 --> 00:43:17,491
A big crush
On them sirens.

875
00:43:18,894 --> 00:43:20,555
Diane dane!
Diane dane!

876
00:43:20,629 --> 00:43:22,028
We love you.

877
00:43:22,097 --> 00:43:24,565
I had my first
Boy-girl thing.

878
00:43:24,633 --> 00:43:28,000
It was for a picture
Of you on a record sleeve.

879
00:43:28,069 --> 00:43:29,036
Yeah, charming.

880
00:43:29,104 --> 00:43:30,002
Excuse me.

881
00:43:30,071 --> 00:43:31,800
Diane dane!

882
00:43:31,873 --> 00:43:35,274
Really, honestly,
You were very important to me.

883
00:43:37,712 --> 00:43:39,145
You the wonders?

884
00:43:39,214 --> 00:43:40,112
We sure are.

885
00:43:40,182 --> 00:43:41,615
And you're freddy
Fredrickson.

886
00:43:41,683 --> 00:43:43,082
Aw, this is
Too much.

887
00:43:43,151 --> 00:43:45,642
I heard your tune in sound check.
It's catchy, man.

888
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,652
Thanks.

889
00:43:46,721 --> 00:43:48,655
First record
I ever bought

890
00:43:48,723 --> 00:43:50,691
Was theme from mr. Downtown.

891
00:43:50,759 --> 00:43:54,286
Darkness falls,
And the night's begun

892
00:43:54,362 --> 00:43:55,795
Wow. You sing
Better than I do.

893
00:43:55,864 --> 00:43:57,832
The river of lights
As bright as the sun

894
00:43:57,899 --> 00:43:59,799
Ok. I'll see you
Out there.

895
00:43:59,868 --> 00:44:01,233
Under the waning moon

896
00:44:01,303 --> 00:44:05,569
There's danger
To be found

897
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:09,974
For the man with the badge
In the night

898
00:44:10,045 --> 00:44:12,775
The man with the badge
In the night

899
00:44:12,848 --> 00:44:13,940
What's his name?

900
00:44:14,015 --> 00:44:18,076
Mr. Downtown

901
00:44:18,153 --> 00:44:21,816
Mr. Downtown

902
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:25,917
Mr. Downtown

903
00:44:25,994 --> 00:44:28,986
Mr. Downtown

904
00:44:29,064 --> 00:44:31,658
Oh, you can't
Run away

905
00:44:31,733 --> 00:44:33,826
No, you can't run away

906
00:44:33,902 --> 00:44:37,633
When you're walking
Along with me

907
00:44:37,706 --> 00:44:39,105
Guy, where are
Your sunglasses?

908
00:44:39,174 --> 00:44:41,608
Where're your sunglasses?
Faye! Faye!

909
00:44:41,676 --> 00:44:42,665
yeah?

910
00:44:42,744 --> 00:44:44,609
Find guy's glasses,
His sunglasses, quick!

911
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:48,615
The portly gentleman
Sniffing his stogy is k.o. Bailey.

912
00:44:48,683 --> 00:44:52,210
He's columbus' second most popular
Disc jockey.

913
00:44:52,287 --> 00:44:54,687
Well, he's the biggest
Cootie I ever saw.

914
00:44:54,756 --> 00:44:56,690
If he likes
What he hears,

915
00:44:56,758 --> 00:45:00,194
He's gonna play that thing you do
Tomorrow morning

916
00:45:00,262 --> 00:45:02,127
With 50,000 watts
Behind it.

917
00:45:02,197 --> 00:45:04,631
It's very important
You don't stink today.

918
00:45:04,699 --> 00:45:06,166
Hey, I make
No guarantees.

919
00:45:06,234 --> 00:45:07,633
We bow, right?
In unison.

920
00:45:07,702 --> 00:45:10,637
And we're off the stage
Before the applause dies out, right?

921
00:45:10,705 --> 00:45:12,138
What if they
Want an encore?

922
00:45:12,207 --> 00:45:14,675
You unplug and you run,
Run off stage...

923
00:45:14,743 --> 00:45:16,176
Smiling,
Smiling of course.

924
00:45:16,244 --> 00:45:17,677
Here you go. Here.

925
00:45:17,746 --> 00:45:19,646
No encores! Guy,
Keep these with you.

926
00:45:19,714 --> 00:45:21,682
Put 'em on. Put 'em on.
There you go.

927
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:24,150
From now on, you have them with you
Day and night.

928
00:45:24,219 --> 00:45:25,413
They're your trademark.

929
00:45:25,487 --> 00:45:27,421
You look good in 'em.

930
00:45:27,489 --> 00:45:29,423
You guys look great
In red.

931
00:45:29,491 --> 00:45:31,925
Have I told you that, yet?
You have your pick?

932
00:45:31,993 --> 00:45:32,960
Right here.

933
00:45:33,028 --> 00:45:33,960
Downtown

934
00:45:34,029 --> 00:45:35,963
All right, this is it.

935
00:45:36,031 --> 00:45:38,431
If the crowd doesn't
Go wild for you,

936
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,933
Don't worry about it.

937
00:45:40,001 --> 00:45:41,468
They will tomorrow.

938
00:45:41,536 --> 00:45:42,969
Thank you, ohio.

939
00:45:43,038 --> 00:45:44,938
All right. Timing is everything
On the entrance.

940
00:45:45,006 --> 00:45:46,940
Fix his jacket so it
Doesn't pouf up behind.

941
00:45:47,008 --> 00:45:48,441
Let's give
A big welcome

942
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:49,977
To the latest
Addition

943
00:45:50,045 --> 00:45:51,603
To the play-tone
Galaxy of stars.

944
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,113
That's it.
Go, go, go, go!

945
00:45:53,181 --> 00:45:54,648
Let's watch. Come on.

946
00:45:54,716 --> 00:45:55,614
The wonders!

947
00:45:55,684 --> 00:45:57,311
There you are.
Right here.

948
00:46:00,989 --> 00:46:03,719
Well, take us there,
Skitch.

949
00:46:14,502 --> 00:46:16,129
You

950
00:46:16,204 --> 00:46:19,367
Doin' that thing
You do

951
00:46:19,441 --> 00:46:25,380
Breakin' my heart
Into a million pieces

952
00:46:25,447 --> 00:46:28,746
Like you always do

953
00:46:28,817 --> 00:46:30,978
And you

954
00:46:31,052 --> 00:46:33,885
Don't mean to be cruel

955
00:46:33,955 --> 00:46:37,083
You never even knew

956
00:46:37,158 --> 00:46:39,626
About the heartache

957
00:46:39,694 --> 00:46:42,822
I've been
Goin' through

958
00:46:42,897 --> 00:46:46,298
Well, I try and try
To forget you, girl

959
00:46:46,368 --> 00:46:50,464
But it's just
So hard to do

960
00:46:50,538 --> 00:46:55,100
If I know you, you're
Doin' that thing you do

961
00:46:55,176 --> 00:46:56,939
Look at 93.

962
00:46:57,879 --> 00:46:58,937
Aah!

964
00:47:00,831 --> 00:47:02,578
- aah!
- hey!

965
00:48:38,178 --> 00:48:40,578
The biggest state fair
In the entire worid.

966
00:48:40,647 --> 00:48:43,115
Uh, talk about
This latest record.

967
00:48:43,183 --> 00:48:44,616
It's our first record.

968
00:48:44,684 --> 00:48:47,585
We wrote it in my garage
In erie, pennsylvania.

969
00:48:47,654 --> 00:48:50,088
I'll wager that
The kids and fellas here

970
00:48:50,156 --> 00:48:52,590
And all the folks
At the fair

971
00:48:52,659 --> 00:48:55,127
Are showing you a time
Like you never had.

972
00:48:55,195 --> 00:48:57,595
Oh, I'm not here
With these fellas.

973
00:48:57,664 --> 00:49:00,599
I got a pig in competition over
At the livestock pavilion,

974
00:49:00,667 --> 00:49:02,862
And I am gonna win
That blue ribbon.

975
00:49:02,936 --> 00:49:05,461
Come on, pretty baby

00:49:05,538 --> 00:49:09,565
Put your little hand

00:49:09,643 --> 00:49:12,373
Things are shakin'
On the dance floor

Everybody's
Feelin' fine

979
00:49:16,716 --> 00:49:19,184
Don't waste
Another minute

Yeah.

You recorded

On live at the philadelphia
Jazzjunction.

1035

00:52:26,506 --> 00:52:27,939
That's me
On the drums, man.

1037
00:52:28,007 --> 00:52:29,531
What was it like to record
With del paxton?

00:52:29,609 --> 00:52:33,067
Miss dane, hi. I'm james mattingly

Oh, yes. Hi.
Nice to see you.

00:52:35,715 --> 00:52:37,649
Did you know we became 21
In billboard?

1041
00:52:37,717 --> 00:52:42,677
Faye, what is jimmy doing
At diane dane's table?

He's showing her how the record made
Number 21 in billboard.

1043
00:52:46,759 --> 00:52:49,421
A record actually
Climbing the charts.

1044
00:52:49,495 --> 00:52:51,395
She'll be chartreuse
With envy.

1045

A lot of cards.

Tell me something, faye.

How long have you and jimmy
Been you and jimmy?

A long time.

Amazing.

1060
00:53:31,671 --> 00:53:33,104
He is.
He's amazing.

1061
00:53:33,172 --> 00:53:34,696
Now, what about
Guy there?

1062
00:53:34,774 --> 00:53:37,208
Does anybody at home
Think he's amazing?

1063
00:53:37,277 --> 00:53:40,041
Well, he had a girlfriend
Back in erie.

1064
00:53:40,113 --> 00:53:43,105
Um, tina. I met her
A couple of times.

1065
00:53:43,182 --> 00:53:45,150
She fell in love
With her dentist.

1066
00:53:45,218 --> 00:53:46,617
Now, that's too bad.

1067
00:53:46,686 --> 00:53:47,653
Yeah.

1068
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,621
Let's try maybe these.

1069
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:51,622
Thinner frames.

1070
00:53:51,691 --> 00:53:52,623
Ok.

1071
00:53:52,692 --> 00:53:55,126
Take those off.
Put these on.

1072
00:53:55,194 --> 00:53:57,662
Ok, look at me, guy.
Look at me.

1073
00:53:57,730 --> 00:53:59,129
These are hip?

1074
00:53:59,198 --> 00:54:01,063
No. Something else.
Try these on.

1075
00:54:01,134 --> 00:54:02,567
Hide your cards.
Sit down.

1076
00:54:02,635 --> 00:54:06,594
Watch these guys.
They're musicians. They cheat.

1077
00:54:06,673 --> 00:54:08,607
So, we're gonna play
The 8,jack...

1078
00:54:08,675 --> 00:54:10,575
Your worid goes on

1079
00:54:10,643 --> 00:54:14,841
But for me,
My worid is over

1080
00:54:14,914 --> 00:54:18,543
Don't know where
I'm gonna go now

1081
00:54:18,618 --> 00:54:22,418
But I got to move on
Somehow

1082
00:54:22,488 --> 00:54:25,252
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Whoa, whoa

1083
00:54:40,673 --> 00:54:45,076
It hurts me so badly,
Deep down inside

1084
00:54:45,144 --> 00:54:48,636
When I think about
All of your lies

1085
00:54:48,715 --> 00:54:50,376
Oh

1086
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:52,645
Your worid goes on

1087
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:57,486
But for me,
My worid is over

1088
00:54:57,557 --> 00:54:58,990
You fellas look
Great in gold.

1089
00:54:59,058 --> 00:55:00,491
Have I told you
That?

1090
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,460
You straight on
Those harmonies now?

1091
00:55:02,528 --> 00:55:03,426
Check.

1092
00:55:04,497 --> 00:55:06,431
Now, you boys have fun.

1093
00:55:06,499 --> 00:55:09,263
I think this is loose.
What is this?

1094
00:55:09,335 --> 00:55:12,031
That was diane dane.

1095
00:55:13,806 --> 00:55:15,239
There she is.

1096
00:55:15,308 --> 00:55:18,766
Diane dane.
Look at that dress, huh?

1097
00:55:18,845 --> 00:55:21,075
That's a-
That's a gold dress,

1098
00:55:21,147 --> 00:55:22,705
Like a wisconsin sunrise.

1099
00:55:22,782 --> 00:55:24,716
Get out of my way.

1100
00:55:24,784 --> 00:55:26,217
This next group...

1101
00:55:26,285 --> 00:55:27,183
Excellent.

1102
00:55:27,253 --> 00:55:28,447
You've all been
Waiting for...

1103
00:55:28,521 --> 00:55:29,920
Here they are...

1104
00:55:29,989 --> 00:55:33,083
Playing that thing that's
Racing up the charts...

1105
00:55:34,527 --> 00:55:35,926
Look out, wisconsin,

1106
00:55:35,995 --> 00:55:38,429
It's...the wonders!

1107
00:55:53,579 --> 00:55:55,479
'Cause we

1108
00:55:55,548 --> 00:55:58,574
Would be happy,
Can't you see?

1109
00:55:58,651 --> 00:56:04,146
If you'd only let me
Be the one to hold you

1110
00:56:04,223 --> 00:56:08,023
And keep you here
With me

1111
00:56:08,094 --> 00:56:11,393
'Cause it hurts me so
Just to see you go

1112
00:56:11,464 --> 00:56:14,592
Around with someone new

1113
00:56:14,667 --> 00:56:19,036
And if I know you,
You're doin' that thing

1114
00:56:19,105 --> 00:56:22,097
Every day,
Just doin' that thing

1115
00:56:22,175 --> 00:56:26,976
And I can't take you
Doin' that thing you do

1116
00:56:37,957 --> 00:56:39,288
Why do we have
To stand on stage

1117
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:40,951
With those other acts at the end
Of the show?

1118
00:56:41,027 --> 00:56:43,757
Because we're members of the play-tone
Galaxy of stars.

1119
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:45,297
Did you see
The cast of bonanza

1120
00:56:45,365 --> 00:56:46,764
Signing autographs
This afternoon?

1121
00:56:46,833 --> 00:56:49,927
I shook hoss' hand.
He had his gun on and everything.

1122
00:56:50,003 --> 00:56:51,834
Next weekend:
The beverly hillbillies.

1123
00:56:51,905 --> 00:56:53,133
Ah, miss elly may.

1124
00:56:53,206 --> 00:56:55,970
Miss elly may go skinny-dippin'
In the cee-ment pond.

1125
00:56:56,042 --> 00:56:57,509
Elly may.
I love her.

1126
00:56:57,577 --> 00:56:59,568
Inside, inside. Come on.

1127
00:56:59,646 --> 00:57:00,738
Change of plans.

1128
00:57:00,813 --> 00:57:03,304
We are leaving here
Just as soon as possible.

1129
00:57:03,383 --> 00:57:06,147
That thing you do
Is the fastest-rising single

1130
00:57:06,219 --> 00:57:08,813
In the history of
The play-tone label.

1131
00:57:08,888 --> 00:57:10,822
As of tomorrow morning,
You wonders-

1132
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:13,688
You've got the number 7 record
In the country.

1133
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:14,658
Aah!

1134
00:57:14,727 --> 00:57:17,321
- oh, my god!
- ohh!

1135
00:57:17,397 --> 00:57:18,989
Ha ha ha!

1136
00:57:21,267 --> 00:57:23,326
Watch the shelf.

1137
00:57:23,403 --> 00:57:25,871
Look, state fairs
Are small potatoes.

1138
00:57:25,939 --> 00:57:28,874
We are on a plane,
Flying to the coast...

1139
00:57:28,942 --> 00:57:31,672
As long as we make
The airport on time.

1140
00:57:31,744 --> 00:57:32,733
- to california?
- disneyland?

1141
00:57:32,812 --> 00:57:34,074
That's right.
California.

1142
00:57:34,147 --> 00:57:36,081
number 7 this week.
Number 1 next week.

1143
00:57:36,149 --> 00:57:37,673
If we become
Number one,

1144
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:40,116
Does that mean
We get a gold record?

1145
00:57:40,186 --> 00:57:42,620
500,000 copies
For a gold.

1146
00:57:47,293 --> 00:57:49,318
Heyyyyy!

1147
00:57:52,131 --> 00:57:53,894
Put your glasses
On, shades.

1148
00:57:53,967 --> 00:57:55,559
Give 'em
What they want.

1149
00:57:55,635 --> 00:57:56,727
Ha ha!
Shades.

1150
00:57:59,272 --> 00:58:00,534
The horses
Are coming.

1151
00:58:00,606 --> 00:58:02,870
Where's the limo?

1152
00:58:02,942 --> 00:58:04,671
All right, men,
Let's go!

1153
00:58:04,744 --> 00:58:06,609
Ha ha!

1154
00:58:10,717 --> 00:58:11,809
Cool!

1155
00:58:12,885 --> 00:58:15,115
No, wait.
I'm with them.jimmy!

1156
00:58:15,188 --> 00:58:19,557
Ladies, climb on top
Of the car with us!

1157
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:22,925
Hey, hold it!
She's with us!

1158
00:58:28,801 --> 00:58:32,134
Well, I like wisconsin.

1159
00:58:32,205 --> 00:58:33,263
Come on!

1160
00:58:40,146 --> 00:58:41,636
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1161
00:58:52,525 --> 00:58:54,652
Hey, fancy
Meeting you here.

1162
00:58:55,695 --> 00:58:57,629
That does not
Sound good.

1163
00:58:57,697 --> 00:58:58,789
You feeling ok?

1164
00:58:58,865 --> 00:59:01,459
No.

1165
00:59:01,534 --> 00:59:02,466
No?

1166
00:59:02,535 --> 00:59:04,332
It's cold in here,
Isn't it?

1167
00:59:04,404 --> 00:59:06,133
No, you've
Got a fever.

1168
00:59:06,205 --> 00:59:08,969
You're warm.
Here, lie down.

1169
00:59:12,745 --> 00:59:14,679
Just gotta
Bundle you up.

1170
00:59:14,747 --> 00:59:16,806
Skitch, band meeting
With herr play-tone.

1171
00:59:16,883 --> 00:59:17,975
Ok.

1172
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:22,650
There you are.

1173
00:59:22,722 --> 00:59:25,156
Now, sleep. No talking.

1174
00:59:25,224 --> 00:59:27,522
We're winging our way
To the coast.

1175
00:59:27,593 --> 00:59:29,891
Mmm, california.

1176
00:59:29,962 --> 00:59:31,554
Here we come.

1177
00:59:34,267 --> 00:59:36,326
You know, faye's
Not feeling very good.

1178
00:59:36,402 --> 00:59:39,235
I wanna know when we'll get
Into a recording studio.

1179
00:59:39,305 --> 00:59:41,136
First things first,
Fellas.

1180
00:59:41,207 --> 00:59:43,539
You have to go off
And pay homage

1181
00:59:43,609 --> 00:59:44,871
To mr. Sol siler.

1182
00:59:44,944 --> 00:59:47,742
He's the founder and chairman
Of play-tone records.

1183
00:59:47,814 --> 00:59:49,611
What hotel are
We staying at?

1184
00:59:49,682 --> 00:59:51,650
It's the place
Lucy and ricky stayed

1185
00:59:51,717 --> 00:59:53,742
When they came out
With fred and ethel.

1186
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:55,981
And then we go
Into the studio?

1187
00:59:56,055 --> 00:59:56,953
Exactly.

1188
00:59:57,023 --> 00:59:58,786
'Cause the point
Of all this

1189
00:59:58,858 --> 01:00:00,450
Is to make
More records.

1190
01:00:00,526 --> 01:00:02,153
What would you fellas
Think about

1191
01:00:02,228 --> 01:00:05,129
Making an appearance in
A major motion picture?

1192
01:00:05,198 --> 01:00:06,790
Whoa-ho-ho!
What movie?

1193
01:00:06,866 --> 01:00:09,835
Then, something
Very grand on the horizon,

1194
01:00:09,902 --> 01:00:12,132
If I have worked
The phones correctly-

1195
01:00:12,205 --> 01:00:15,663
The hollywood
TelevisiÃ³n showcase.

1196
01:00:15,741 --> 01:00:16,799
Hmm?

1197
01:00:16,876 --> 01:00:19,003
we are gonna
Be on tv.

1198
01:00:19,078 --> 01:00:20,477
Man!

1199
01:00:20,546 --> 01:00:22,173
Then after that,
Sometime,

1200
01:00:22,248 --> 01:00:24,341
Discmaster studios
On sunset...

1201
01:00:24,417 --> 01:00:26,009
We cut another record.

1202
01:00:26,085 --> 01:00:27,484
Any questions,
Don't ask.

1203
01:00:27,553 --> 01:00:29,180
I'm tired
Of talking to you,

1204
01:00:29,255 --> 01:00:31,314
And I want to sleep.

1205
01:00:34,727 --> 01:00:37,195
Lenny, give me
That paper.

1206
01:00:37,263 --> 01:00:38,753
Give me the paper.

1207
01:00:44,337 --> 01:00:47,773
Lenny, why don't you
Go and see if you can
Visit the cockpit?

1208
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:50,604
Tell them it's your birthday.
Go, go, go.

1209
01:01:12,231 --> 01:01:13,129
Hey, rose.

1210
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:14,166
Hi, lamarr.

1211
01:01:14,233 --> 01:01:16,133
I don't have any cash.

1212
01:01:16,202 --> 01:01:19,137
Well, then charge it
To your room, cherie.

1213
01:01:19,205 --> 01:01:20,331
2242.

1214
01:01:20,406 --> 01:01:21,464
Excuse me.

1215
01:01:21,541 --> 01:01:23,975
Ooh. And I'll send you up
Some soup, too.

1216
01:01:24,043 --> 01:01:25,010
Oh, thank you.

1217
01:01:25,077 --> 01:01:26,977
My name is lamarr,
And this is my hotel,

1218
01:01:27,046 --> 01:01:28,604
And we take care
Of people here.

1219
01:01:28,681 --> 01:01:29,875
I'm faye.

1220
01:01:29,949 --> 01:01:32,315
Didn't I check you
In with a quartet of gentlemen?

1221
01:01:32,385 --> 01:01:35,650
And why aren't they here to take care
Of your needs?

1222
01:01:35,721 --> 01:01:38,485
They're off making
A major motion picture.

1223
01:01:38,558 --> 01:01:42,324
Oh, we got movie stars
In my hotel.

1224
01:01:42,395 --> 01:01:44,625
They're musicians,
Actually.

1225
01:01:44,697 --> 01:01:45,789
Even better.

1226
01:01:49,835 --> 01:01:52,770
Whoo!

1227
01:02:20,132 --> 01:02:21,724
rick! Anita!

1228
01:02:21,801 --> 01:02:23,029
The music stopped.

1229
01:02:23,102 --> 01:02:24,626
Yeah. Keep playing.

1230
01:02:25,871 --> 01:02:28,465
All right, anita,
I get the message.

1231
01:02:28,541 --> 01:02:31,135
It's about time
You noticed, rick.

1232
01:02:32,211 --> 01:02:33,143
Thanks, goofball.

1233
01:02:33,212 --> 01:02:35,476
Sure thing,
Anita sweetheart.

1234
01:02:35,548 --> 01:02:37,243
keep dancing, goofball.

1235
01:02:38,317 --> 01:02:40,012
Now look out
At the ocean.

1236
01:02:40,086 --> 01:02:41,018
Say the line.

1237
01:02:41,087 --> 01:02:43,055
We're being
Invaded!

1238
01:02:43,122 --> 01:02:44,384
Run out of
The shot!

1239
01:02:44,457 --> 01:02:45,424
Playback!

1240
01:02:45,491 --> 01:02:46,549
Playback!

1241
01:02:57,937 --> 01:02:59,598
- cut!
- cut! Cut! Cut!

1242
01:02:59,672 --> 01:03:01,537
Print it!
Excellent!

1243
01:03:01,607 --> 01:03:03,541
Hey, guys,
Boots randolph!

1244
01:03:05,011 --> 01:03:05,978
Yeah!

1245
01:03:06,045 --> 01:03:08,309
We look like a bunch
Of chimpanzees.

1246
01:03:08,381 --> 01:03:10,349
No. We look like
A rock 'n' roll band

1247
01:03:10,416 --> 01:03:11,713
Playing
A rock 'n' roll song

1248
01:03:11,784 --> 01:03:13,342
During weekend at party pier.

1249
01:03:13,419 --> 01:03:15,114
We're not the wonders
Right now.

1250
01:03:15,187 --> 01:03:18,350
We're cap'n geech and
The shrimp shack shooters.

1251
01:03:18,424 --> 01:03:19,516
Hey, good news,
Fellas.

1252
01:03:19,592 --> 01:03:21,526
You get to keep
Your wardrobe.

1253
01:03:21,594 --> 01:03:23,221
Ha ha ha!

1254
01:03:24,463 --> 01:03:27,057
Hey, do we have
A top-10 record?

1255
01:03:27,133 --> 01:03:28,191
You sure do.

1256
01:03:28,267 --> 01:03:30,258
Then we shouldn't
Be here.

1257
01:03:30,336 --> 01:03:33,305
Would you rather be back
On that state fair tour?

1258
01:03:33,372 --> 01:03:35,135
They're playing
North dakota this week.

1259
01:03:35,207 --> 01:03:37,903
No, no, no.
I vote for weekend at party pier.

1260
01:03:37,977 --> 01:03:39,274
Smart man.

1261
01:03:39,345 --> 01:03:43,213
You should have told us about this
Rick and anita movie.

1262
01:03:43,282 --> 01:03:47,241
So mark that date-
Saturday and sunday,
August 20th and 21 st,

1263
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,753
Pacific car showroom.

1264
01:03:48,821 --> 01:03:51,255
Just look for the kmpc
Hit caravan and me.

1265
01:03:51,324 --> 01:03:53,053
I'll be out there
Signing autographs.

1266
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:57,118
If you want a picture of me
In my official dodge boys
Rally team windbreaker,

1267
01:03:57,196 --> 01:03:58,925
Well, then i
Just might oblige.

1268
01:03:58,998 --> 01:04:02,263
But hey! I got some exciting guests
On my show today.

1269
01:04:02,335 --> 01:04:05,065
Makers of a hit record,
Visitors from the east-

1270
01:04:05,137 --> 01:04:07,765
Oops! Hold on, giris.
Not those mop-tops.

1271
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,774
Ha ha ha.
No, I'm talking

1272
01:04:09,842 --> 01:04:12,640
About america's own
Wonderful...wonders!

1273
01:04:12,712 --> 01:04:13,906
Say hello, fellas!

1274
01:04:13,979 --> 01:04:15,139
- hi!
- hi!

1275
01:04:15,214 --> 01:04:16,613
And here's their hit-

1276
01:04:16,682 --> 01:04:20,311
A big l.a. Fave rave at 10 minutes
Past 7:00 in the morning

1277
01:04:20,386 --> 01:04:22,320
On kmpc...los Ã¡ngeles!

1278
01:04:24,023 --> 01:04:26,287
Thanks, guys.
Just leave the headphones in there.

1279
01:04:26,359 --> 01:04:28,122
That thing you do

1280
01:04:28,194 --> 01:04:29,456
Breaking my heart-

1281
01:04:29,528 --> 01:04:32,520
let me ask
You cats this question:

1282
01:04:32,598 --> 01:04:34,190
Who were your influences?

1283
01:04:34,266 --> 01:04:36,325
Which artists
Popped your cherry?

1284
01:04:36,402 --> 01:04:37,460
The chantrellines.

1285
01:04:40,506 --> 01:04:41,734
The chantrellines.

1286
01:04:41,807 --> 01:04:43,331
Dion and the belmonts.

1287
01:04:43,409 --> 01:04:46,469
Cap'n geech and
The shrimp shack shooters.

1288
01:04:48,247 --> 01:04:49,509
Uh...stan getz-

1289
01:04:49,582 --> 01:04:51,379
Anything he did on
The verve label...

1290
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:53,543
Bill evans trÃ­o,
Ira sullivan,

1291
01:04:53,619 --> 01:04:55,610
Kenny durham,
John young...

1292
01:04:56,522 --> 01:04:57,614
Del paxton.

1293
01:04:57,690 --> 01:04:59,817
Yeah.

1294
01:04:59,892 --> 01:05:02,827
Time to blow.
My uncle gave me that record,

1295
01:05:02,895 --> 01:05:05,830
And we played it in
The high school band.

1296
01:05:05,898 --> 01:05:08,833
Del paxton in the high school band-
That's wild.

1297
01:05:08,901 --> 01:05:11,495
Yeah, we were pretty wild
In erie, penn.

1298
01:05:11,570 --> 01:05:13,504
There was this one time

1299
01:05:13,572 --> 01:05:16,598
When we stayed up
Way past midnight, and...

1300
01:05:19,845 --> 01:05:20,777
Smiling, smiling...

1301
01:05:20,846 --> 01:05:23,314
Wait a minute, gigi.
Hold on, hold on.

1302
01:05:23,382 --> 01:05:25,543
Let's have the label
Right side up, shall we?

1303
01:05:25,618 --> 01:05:28,348
Hey, how come you guys
Don't have long hair like the beatles?

1304
01:05:28,421 --> 01:05:30,013
Don't you guys
Like the beatles?

1305
01:05:30,089 --> 01:05:32,023
You, in the linettes,
Are those prescription,

1306
01:05:32,091 --> 01:05:34,025
Or are you just trying
To look cool?

1307
01:05:34,093 --> 01:05:35,788
Well, I am
The drummer.

1308
01:05:35,861 --> 01:05:36,850
Oh.

1309
01:05:36,929 --> 01:05:38,260
Where the hell
Is solly?

1310
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:40,025
Sol siler is here!

1311
01:05:40,099 --> 01:05:41,828
- hooray!

1312
01:05:41,901 --> 01:05:44,199
- hi, gigi!
- hey, solly!

1313
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:45,965
Billy, how you doing?

1314
01:05:46,038 --> 01:05:47,266
Hey, fran,
Is that you?

1315
01:05:47,339 --> 01:05:48,328
How was
Acapulco, sol?

1316
01:05:48,407 --> 01:05:49,635
Wonderful,
Wonderful.

1317
01:05:49,708 --> 01:05:52,108
Did mimi go with you,
Or did she have to stay home?

1318
01:05:52,178 --> 01:05:53,406
She had the flu.

1319
01:05:53,479 --> 01:05:55,276
Solly, how's your pals
In the sheriff s department?

1320
01:05:55,347 --> 01:05:58,748
You guys spend a little too much time
In the wrong places.

1321
01:05:58,818 --> 01:06:01,446
Solly, is it true don drysdale
Gave you a sock in the snooker?

1322
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,283
Old news, fred.
Old news.

1323
01:06:03,355 --> 01:06:05,619
Business, gents.
Got to take care of business.

1324
01:06:05,691 --> 01:06:08,251
Wanna tell you about my new boys,
The wonders.

1325
01:06:08,327 --> 01:06:11,785
Top-10 and fastest ever
Teen sensations.

1326
01:06:11,864 --> 01:06:14,992
Caused the worst riot in texas
Since oswald got shot.

1327
01:06:15,067 --> 01:06:18,468
So, solly, saw you at chasen's
With suzanne pleshette.

1328
01:06:18,537 --> 01:06:21,597
Quit with that.
The wife works upstairs.

1329
01:06:21,674 --> 01:06:23,266
Let's go have
Some deli.

1330
01:06:23,342 --> 01:06:24,309
Lookin' good.

1331
01:06:24,376 --> 01:06:25,934
What about the
Dave clark five?

1332
01:06:26,011 --> 01:06:28,605
You think all this
British beat stuff is new?

1333
01:06:28,681 --> 01:06:31,115
Give us another month,
We'll be invading them.

1334
01:06:31,183 --> 01:06:32,445
Is that it?

1335
01:06:32,518 --> 01:06:33,485
Yeah.

1336
01:06:33,552 --> 01:06:36,146
I'll be sure to give him
The message.

1337
01:06:36,222 --> 01:06:38,622
Thank you.
Bye-bye.

1338
01:06:38,691 --> 01:06:39,623
Hi.

1339
01:06:39,692 --> 01:06:40,659
Hi.

1340
01:06:40,726 --> 01:06:41,624
How you doin'?

1341
01:06:41,694 --> 01:06:42,820
Good.

1342
01:06:42,895 --> 01:06:46,626
So, how long have you worked
Here at play-tone?

1343
01:06:46,699 --> 01:06:50,795
How long you been wearing
Such tight pants?

1344
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:53,464
Wow, if that was
A pick-up line,

1345
01:06:53,539 --> 01:06:55,404
We're a match
Made in heaven.

1346
01:06:55,474 --> 01:06:56,702
Excuse me, mr. Siler.

1347
01:06:56,775 --> 01:06:59,471
James mattingly ii,
Lead singer ofthe wonders.

1348
01:06:59,545 --> 01:07:01,513
I wrote
That thing you do.

1349
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:03,138
I wrote many other songs

1350
01:07:03,215 --> 01:07:05,979
That I think we should
Make an appointment and share.

1351
01:07:06,051 --> 01:07:07,678
What is jimmy doing?

1352
01:07:07,753 --> 01:07:08,845
arrghh!

1353
01:07:08,921 --> 01:07:10,286
Jimmy!

1354
01:07:10,356 --> 01:07:12,483
What in the bloody hell
Is this?

1355
01:07:12,558 --> 01:07:14,025
This is during
My lunchtime?

1356
01:07:14,093 --> 01:07:16,493
Yeah, like I got
Time on my hands-

1357
01:07:16,562 --> 01:07:18,826
You wanna get fabian
Away from me?

1358
01:07:18,898 --> 01:07:20,331
he doesn't know
Who we are.

1359
01:07:20,399 --> 01:07:21,866
To him, we could
Be anybody.

1360
01:07:21,934 --> 01:07:23,492
he knows who
The wonders are.

1361
01:07:23,569 --> 01:07:25,332
he didn't listen
To any other songs?

1362
01:07:25,404 --> 01:07:27,497
that guy hasn't even heard
That thing you do.

1363
01:07:27,573 --> 01:07:30,667
I don't think sol siler's
The person who listens to songs.

1364
01:07:30,743 --> 01:07:32,506
he's the guy
Who's in charge

1365
01:07:32,578 --> 01:07:34,512
Of the entire
Play-tone galaxy.

1366
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:37,879
This is the man who's in charge
Of our collective fate,

1367
01:07:37,950 --> 01:07:39,212
Our creative destiny.

1368
01:07:39,285 --> 01:07:41,617
Oh...come on!

1369
01:07:41,687 --> 01:07:44,451
Diane warned me
About this.

1370
01:07:44,523 --> 01:07:46,991
Diane dane?

1371
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:51,193
Diane dane.
What'd she say?

1372
01:07:51,263 --> 01:07:53,288
Never trust a label.

1373
01:07:53,365 --> 01:07:55,333
And I'm beginning
To believe her.

1374
01:07:55,401 --> 01:07:56,629
Lenny:
Oh, I agree.

1375
01:07:56,702 --> 01:08:00,297
Come on, they put us up
In a first-class hotel,

1376
01:08:00,372 --> 01:08:04,331
All expenses paid
While our record climbs the charts.

1377
01:08:04,410 --> 01:08:06,901
Bunch of lying snakes.

1378
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:10,144
I'm sorry
I'm bugging you.

1379
01:08:10,215 --> 01:08:14,083
I guess I'm alone
In my principles.

1380
01:08:14,153 --> 01:08:15,415
Come on.

1381
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:18,354
There he goes, off to his room
To write that hit song,

1382
01:08:18,424 --> 01:08:20,358
Alone /n
My principles.

1383
01:08:20,426 --> 01:08:22,724
Young squires,
Young squires.

1384
01:08:22,795 --> 01:08:25,320
Faye, I'm glad to see you're
Feeling better.

1385
01:08:25,397 --> 01:08:26,659
- lenny, right?
- yeah.

1386
01:08:26,732 --> 01:08:29,758
Listen, a major blonde
In a major car just pulled up.

1387
01:08:29,835 --> 01:08:32,167
I think she wants
To show you the town.

1388
01:08:34,773 --> 01:08:36,673
God! Great!

1389
01:08:36,742 --> 01:08:38,972
Breath-good? No?

1390
01:08:39,044 --> 01:08:41,478
All right. See you guys.

1391
01:08:41,547 --> 01:08:44,107
Hold my calls.

1392
01:08:44,183 --> 01:08:46,117
Listen, have you
Kids had dessert?

1393
01:08:46,185 --> 01:08:47,709
Try the
Peach cobbler.

1394
01:08:47,786 --> 01:08:49,378
Best in
The southland.

1395
01:08:49,455 --> 01:08:52,515
Hey, I got you
Some flowers.

1396
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:59,997
You gotta understand
Something aboutjimmy.

1397
01:09:00,065 --> 01:09:02,659
His-his standards
Are way up there

1398
01:09:02,735 --> 01:09:04,999
Because he's so smart.

1399
01:09:05,070 --> 01:09:08,164
He tested in high school
At genius level,

1400
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:10,970
So that's why...

1401
01:09:17,049 --> 01:09:20,018
I feel terrible.
I'm gonna go back to bed.

1402
01:09:20,085 --> 01:09:21,814
Yeah, that's
A good idea.

1403
01:09:23,088 --> 01:09:24,180
Bye, faye.

1404
01:09:24,256 --> 01:09:26,224

You wanna get

1411
01:09:46,045 --> 01:09:47,171
Go see some
Of the coast?

1412
01:09:47,246 --> 01:09:49,180
Yes, definitely.

1413
01:09:49,248 --> 01:09:51,443

What's that theater

The movie stars put their hands
In the front?

Oh. Grauman's
Chinese theater.

1417
01:09:58,390 --> 01:09:59,789
That'd be fun.

1418
01:10:01,427 --> 01:10:03,019
Excuse me, sirs.

01:10:03,095 --> 01:10:06,963
Um, I wanted to inform you

And, um, I can already
Do 200 pushups.

01:10:09,868 --> 01:10:10,926
Really, boot?

1422
01:10:11,003 --> 01:10:11,970
Yes, sir.

1423
01:10:12,037 --> 01:10:14,528
Why don't you give us 100

1424
01:10:14,606 --> 01:10:15,732
Yes, sir!

1425
01:10:15,808 --> 01:10:17,366
Count 'em off.

Gotcha.

01:10:35,394 --> 01:10:37,954
Hey, lamarr, is there
Any place around here

1436
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:39,588
With really good jazz?

1437
01:10:39,665 --> 01:10:41,599
Oh, you want good jazz?

1438
01:10:41,667 --> 01:10:43,100
Good jazz?

1439
01:10:43,168 --> 01:10:44,965
Let me ask you
A question.

1440
01:10:45,037 --> 01:10:50,475
Who played coronet
Forjacques st. Claire on vital stats?

1441
01:10:50,542 --> 01:10:51,770
Scotty mcdonald.

1442
01:10:51,844 --> 01:10:55,280
Get in the cab.
Get in the cab!

1443
01:10:55,347 --> 01:10:58,282
Take this young man
To the blue spot.

1444
01:11:30,549 --> 01:11:34,645
Oh, good jazz.
They're fine!

1445
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:37,086
Yeah.

1446
01:11:59,011 --> 01:12:00,603
Oh, yeah, yeah!

1447
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:09,412
Yeah.

1448
01:12:14,526 --> 01:12:17,495
I left vancouver
For tacoma,

1449
01:12:17,563 --> 01:12:20,794
Tacoma for portland...

1450
01:12:20,866 --> 01:12:22,959
Oh, I got married
In portland. Yeah.

1451
01:12:23,035 --> 01:12:25,629
Oh, and then I left portland
For reno,

1452
01:12:25,704 --> 01:12:27,968
And then I got
Divorced in reno.

1453
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:30,133
Then wised up and faced
The inevitable.

1454
01:12:30,209 --> 01:12:32,211
You know, I moved to l.a.

1455
01:12:32,344 --> 01:12:35,142
Is the trÃ­o
Going on again?

1456
01:12:36,315 --> 01:12:37,612
I don't know.

1457
01:12:37,683 --> 01:12:39,344
Looks like they're
Kind of busy

1458
01:12:39,418 --> 01:12:42,012
Doing the cock 'n' bull
With del there.

1459
01:12:42,087 --> 01:12:43,054

01:12:43,121 --> 01:12:44,952
Yeah, del paxton.

1461
01:12:45,023 --> 01:12:47,856
Roving hands,
But good cock 'n' bull.

01:12:47,926 --> 01:12:49,860
Del paxton.

01:12:58,237 --> 01:13:01,570
Oh...oh,
Oh, my god.

1468
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:05,337
Oh, my god. Del paxton
Is sitting over there.

1469
01:13:05,410 --> 01:13:07,970
Oh, heh heh heh.

1470
01:13:08,046 --> 01:13:09,980
I just lost you,
Didn't I?

1471
01:13:10,048 --> 01:13:12,482
You wanna meet him?

1472
01:13:15,087 --> 01:13:18,215
What? No...no.

1473
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:19,880

1474
01:13:19,958 --> 01:13:22,449

1475
01:13:22,527 --> 01:13:24,461
Marguerite,
What you got here?

1476
01:13:24,529 --> 01:13:25,962
You may not
Believe this, del,

1477
01:13:26,031 --> 01:13:27,293
But this kid has
Heard of you.

1478
01:13:27,366 --> 01:13:31,200
That right?
Well, sit down. Buy me a drink.

1479
01:13:33,538 --> 01:13:35,870
Del paxton.
Who are you?

1480
01:13:35,941 --> 01:13:38,239
I'm guy patterson.
I'm from erie, pennsylvania.

1481
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:40,403
I'm in a band
Called the wonders,

1482
01:13:40,479 --> 01:13:42,413
And we're-we
Just cut a record,

1483
01:13:42,481 --> 01:13:44,449
And we're out here
On the coast,

1484
01:13:44,516 --> 01:13:45,915
And I play
The drums,

1485
01:13:45,984 --> 01:13:47,417
And I have
All your records.

1486
01:13:47,486 --> 01:13:49,954
Well, not all of them,
But a lot of them.

1487
01:13:50,022 --> 01:13:51,580
At least I did until
Some of them got swiped

1488
01:13:51,657 --> 01:13:53,625
When I was stationed
In germany,

1489
01:13:53,692 --> 01:13:54,750
And you were
Playing in germany

1490
01:13:54,826 --> 01:13:56,191
At the time I was
Stationed there.

1491
01:13:56,261 --> 01:13:57,660
But, you know what?
I couldn't see you

1492
01:13:57,729 --> 01:13:58,991
Because you were
Playing in hamburg

1493
01:13:59,064 --> 01:14:00,292
And I was stationed
In munich.

1494
01:14:00,365 --> 01:14:02,094
But I listen
To your records,

1495
01:14:02,167 --> 01:14:03,566
And I think
You're great.

1496
01:14:03,635 --> 01:14:07,628
You are
My biggest fan.

1497
01:14:07,706 --> 01:14:08,934
Heh heh.

1498
01:14:09,007 --> 01:14:10,099
Thanks.

1499
01:14:10,175 --> 01:14:11,904
I'll have another
Hennessey.

1500
01:14:11,977 --> 01:14:13,808
A hennessey for
Del paxton.

1501
01:14:13,879 --> 01:14:14,937
All right.

1502
01:14:18,216 --> 01:14:20,650
Ain't no way to keep
A band together.

1503
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:22,414
Bands come and go.

1504
01:14:22,487 --> 01:14:27,823
You got to keep on playin',
No matter with who.

1505
01:14:27,893 --> 01:14:29,622
You guys any good?

1506
01:14:29,695 --> 01:14:31,788
Yeah.

1507
01:14:31,863 --> 01:14:33,797
Yeah, man, we got-

1508
01:14:33,865 --> 01:14:38,063
Jimmy and lenny
And me and...faye-

1509
01:14:39,971 --> 01:14:42,235
We got something
Snappy.

1510
01:14:42,307 --> 01:14:43,934
Really think we do.

1511
01:14:44,009 --> 01:14:45,533
I'm sure you do,

1512
01:14:45,610 --> 01:14:49,569
But sooner or later,
Something makes you crazy:

1513
01:14:49,648 --> 01:14:53,744
Money, women, the road.

1514
01:14:53,819 --> 01:14:56,447
Hell, man,just time.

1515
01:14:56,521 --> 01:14:59,081
Well, we've only been
Together for 2 months.

1516
01:14:59,157 --> 01:15:03,184
Some bands I been with,
That's 2 months too long.

1517
01:15:03,261 --> 01:15:06,025
Last call, lovers.

1518
01:15:07,999 --> 01:15:10,627
I'm gone.

1519
01:15:10,702 --> 01:15:13,102
You keep on playin'...

1520
01:15:13,171 --> 01:15:14,968
And watch your money.

1521
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,133
You'll land
On your feet.

1522
01:15:20,045 --> 01:15:21,637
Thanks for
Your hospitality.

1523
01:15:21,713 --> 01:15:24,614
Thank you,
Del paxton.

1524
01:15:24,683 --> 01:15:27,117
Nice young man,
Huh, marguerite?

1525
01:15:27,185 --> 01:15:29,949
Oh, very nice
Young man, del.

01:15:32,457 --> 01:15:33,890
Thank you, del!

1529
01:15:37,028 --> 01:15:38,757
Just look at you.

1530
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:41,060
You're no good
To me now.

1531
01:15:42,667 --> 01:15:44,225
Lamarr:
Taxi! Over here!

1532
01:15:51,176 --> 01:15:53,041
good morning, guy.
We have a crisis here.

1533
01:15:53,111 --> 01:15:54,669
Your bass player
Has disappeared,

1534
01:15:54,746 --> 01:15:56,373
And you are still in bed!

1535
01:15:56,448 --> 01:15:59,576
Just calling to tell you
To get your patootie down
To the televisiÃ³n studio!

1536
01:15:59,651 --> 01:16:01,744
You're gonna be
On tv tonight!

01:16:10,762 --> 01:16:12,855
Excuse me! Excuse me!

1538
01:16:29,014 --> 01:16:30,003
Hiya!

1539
01:16:30,081 --> 01:16:31,139
Where's lenny?

1540
01:16:31,216 --> 01:16:33,309
Gettin' me a soda.

1541
01:16:33,385 --> 01:16:34,352
Where's jimmy?

1542
01:16:34,419 --> 01:16:37,786
He the guy throwin' up
In the bathroom?

1543
01:16:41,693 --> 01:16:43,661
Holy cow! What's
Wrong with you?

1544
01:16:46,198 --> 01:16:48,166
Hey, guy, I think-

1545
01:16:48,233 --> 01:16:51,031
I think faye
Gave me something.

1546
01:16:51,102 --> 01:16:52,967
We're on tv
In a few hours.

1547
01:16:53,038 --> 01:16:54,005
I know!

1548
01:16:54,072 --> 01:16:56,131
Hey, guy,
What do you think of her?

1549
01:16:56,208 --> 01:16:57,766
She was
A playboy bunny!

1550
01:16:57,843 --> 01:17:00,311
Took me up to
Her apartment last night,

1551
01:17:00,378 --> 01:17:01,970
Way up with
The coyotes,

1552
01:17:02,047 --> 01:17:03,639
Where I did me
Some howling.

1553
01:17:03,715 --> 01:17:05,012
Where's
Our bass player?

1554
01:17:05,083 --> 01:17:06,015
Isn't he here?

1555
01:17:06,084 --> 01:17:07,813
No. I gotta call
The hotel.

1556
01:17:07,886 --> 01:17:09,854
How far a drive
Is it to las vegas?

1557
01:17:09,921 --> 01:17:11,513
'Cause I'm driving
There tonight,

1558
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:13,319
Through the desert
With the top down.

1559
01:17:13,391 --> 01:17:15,985
I'm in love, skitch!
Freakin' stars in my head.

1560
01:17:18,063 --> 01:17:20,122
Upchucking,
Mr. Hammerstein?

1561
01:17:20,198 --> 01:17:23,031
Are you nervous about tonight's
Big live broadcast?

1562
01:17:23,101 --> 01:17:24,932
Huh? Huhhhhhh?

1563
01:17:25,003 --> 01:17:27,665
No. I've left 15 messages!

1564
01:17:27,739 --> 01:17:30,469
Where the hell is he?

1565
01:17:30,542 --> 01:17:32,169
Aaaah!

1566
01:17:34,412 --> 01:17:35,310
Whooo!

1567
01:17:35,380 --> 01:17:37,245
Yeah!

1568
01:17:38,350 --> 01:17:39,783
Yeah!

1569
01:17:45,323 --> 01:17:46,722
I don't know
Where he is,

1570
01:17:46,791 --> 01:17:49,453
But he was joining the marines
In august anyway.

1571
01:17:49,528 --> 01:17:51,291
This was gonna happen sooner or later.

1572
01:17:51,363 --> 01:17:53,991
Guy, say hello to wolfman,
Mr. Scott pell.

1573

Yes.

1575
01:17:56,735 --> 01:17:58,066
Who's he
Played with?

1576
01:17:58,136 --> 01:18:00,070
The techniques...

1577
01:18:00,138 --> 01:18:02,936
Uh, roy maxwell
And the corsairs.

1578
01:18:03,008 --> 01:18:05,602
Ha ha...
Really?

1579
01:18:05,677 --> 01:18:08,009
He's your
New bass player.

1580
01:18:08,079 --> 01:18:10,343
Mr. White,
No offense...

1581
01:18:10,415 --> 01:18:12,610
I- we've been together
For a while.

1582
01:18:12,684 --> 01:18:14,743
There aren't a lot
Of options here, guy.

1583
01:18:14,819 --> 01:18:16,912
Can he handle
Our tune?

1584
01:18:16,988 --> 01:18:19,320
I think I can
Handle it,junior.

1585
01:18:31,903 --> 01:18:32,870
Ok.

1586
01:18:32,938 --> 01:18:34,030
All right.

1587
01:18:34,105 --> 01:18:35,629
Mr. White...

1588
01:18:35,707 --> 01:18:37,334
Faye's not gonna
Miss this, is she?

1589
01:18:37,409 --> 01:18:38,774
Oh, no.
She'll be here.

1590
01:18:38,843 --> 01:18:40,401
I've taken care
Of her.

1591
01:19:04,936 --> 01:19:07,962
from the brand-new
City of broadcasting

1592
01:19:08,039 --> 01:19:09,973
In santa monica,
California,

...Canadian funnymen,
Fletcher and o'shaughnessey!

Give me
The remote control.

1607
01:19:41,506 --> 01:19:43,064
Hey, mr. P,
Do you think guy

1608
01:19:43,141 --> 01:19:44,403
Got to meet
Gus grissom?

1609
01:19:44,476 --> 01:19:46,273
Oh, man, wouldn't
That be something

1610
01:19:46,344 --> 01:19:48,141
If he met
Gus grissom?

1611
01:19:48,213 --> 01:19:50,113
That's a good picture
There now.

1612
01:19:50,181 --> 01:19:51,205
Look at that.

1613
01:19:51,282 --> 01:19:53,614
...nylon,
And acrylon fibers.

1614
01:19:53,685 --> 01:19:56,313
And now, here's the star
Of this week's showcase...

1615
01:19:56,388 --> 01:19:59,289
Troy chesterfield!

1616
01:20:07,899 --> 01:20:09,127
Thank you!

1617
01:20:13,471 --> 01:20:14,904
All right now,
Everybody settle down.

1618
01:20:14,973 --> 01:20:16,406
He won't be on for
Another half-hour.

1619
01:20:16,474 --> 01:20:18,408
They got a bunch of other acts
That come on before.

1620
01:20:18,476 --> 01:20:20,068
Yeah. Last week,
They had this elephant-

1621
01:20:20,145 --> 01:20:21,578
Oh, playing
The harmonica!

1622
01:20:25,450 --> 01:20:27,042
But seriously, gus...

1623
01:20:27,118 --> 01:20:29,814
What is it like flying up there
In outer space

1624
01:20:29,888 --> 01:20:31,446
In the-what is it-
The gemini?

1625
01:20:31,523 --> 01:20:33,718
That's right, troy.
It'll be called the gemini.

1626
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:35,987
See, I guess I'd
Have to say

1627
01:20:36,061 --> 01:20:37,619
That flying
In outer space

1628
01:20:37,696 --> 01:20:40,256
Is a lot like your working
With gina lollobrigida

1629
01:20:40,331 --> 01:20:41,593
In your
Latest movie-

1630
01:20:41,666 --> 01:20:44,157
It's out of
This worid.

1631
01:20:44,235 --> 01:20:45,497
Here's a question
I have...

1632
01:20:45,570 --> 01:20:46,559
Going back
To one.

1633
01:20:46,638 --> 01:20:47,570
How's the food?

1634
01:20:47,639 --> 01:20:48,571
Go one!

1635
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,868
It's pretty good,
Troy.

1636
01:20:49,941 --> 01:20:52,569
Nasa's working on
New zero-g food all the time.

1637
01:20:52,644 --> 01:20:53,941
- take 2!
- like what?

1638
01:20:54,012 --> 01:20:55,274
Well,just last week,

1639
01:20:55,346 --> 01:20:57,314
I sampled a compressed
Turkey product,

1640
01:20:57,382 --> 01:20:58,781
Processed succotash,

1641
01:20:58,850 --> 01:21:01,114
And a packet of concentrated
Prune juice-

1642
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:21,065
Oh...that's gotta hurt.

1643
01:21:21,139 --> 01:21:24,006
teen sensations
The wonders to the stage, please.

1644
01:21:24,075 --> 01:21:25,133
Boys, we go.

1645
01:21:25,210 --> 01:21:27,303
Teen sensations the wonders
To the stage.

1646
01:21:27,378 --> 01:21:29,744
You look fabulous
In the black suits-

1647
01:21:29,814 --> 01:21:31,782
Hi-fabulous in
The black suits.

1648
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:34,182
I can just imagine
Guy backstage right now,

1649
01:21:34,252 --> 01:21:35,810
Just waiting to go on.

1650
01:21:35,887 --> 01:21:38,754
You think they'll show
A shot of him backstage, dear,

1651
01:21:38,823 --> 01:21:40,085
Waiting to go on?

1652
01:21:40,158 --> 01:21:41,921
No, honey, they won't show
Him backstage.

1653
01:21:41,993 --> 01:21:43,927
They'll show him
When he comes out to perform.

1654
01:21:43,995 --> 01:21:45,758
I wonder how many people
Are watching this.

1655
01:21:45,830 --> 01:21:48,196
How many people saw the beatles
On the ed sullivan show?

1656
01:21:49,834 --> 01:21:52,462
Excuse me.
Is that where the wonders come out?

1657
01:21:52,537 --> 01:21:54,095
Yeah, right there.

1658
01:22:00,445 --> 01:22:02,276
Hey, skitch...

1659
01:22:02,347 --> 01:22:04,679

And now...
For you kids,

1665
01:22:21,533 --> 01:22:23,558
The latest
Rock 'n' roll group

1666

To challenge the beatles
To a hair-combing contest-

1667
01:22:26,371 --> 01:22:28,168
That's just
What we all need-

1668
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:31,640
The new teen sensations,
The wonders!

1669
01:22:43,655 --> 01:22:45,088

Ha ha ha ha!

Well, I've tried and tried
To forget you, girl

1683
01:23:14,385 --> 01:23:18,481
But it's just
So hard to do

1684
01:23:18,556 --> 01:23:22,652

Slow move in.
There's not a big hurry here.

01:23:33,238 --> 01:23:34,466
Not a big hurry.

1691
01:23:34,539 --> 01:23:37,337
Nice and easy.
That's a pretty shot.

1692
01:23:37,408 --> 01:23:39,342

01:25:47,572 --> 01:25:48,561
For the whole worid
To see.

1737
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:50,072
I didn't
Say anything.

1738
01:25:50,141 --> 01:25:51,870
I was just as
Surprised as you.

1739
01:25:51,943 --> 01:25:55,572
"Careful, giris,
He's engaged."

1740
01:25:55,646 --> 01:25:57,273
Am I supposed to buy you
Some diamond ring now?

1741
01:25:57,348 --> 01:26:01,216
You're ruining this
Beautiful moment.

1742
01:26:01,285 --> 01:26:02,912
Where'd you get the idea
That we're engaged?

1743
01:26:02,987 --> 01:26:04,784
We're not!

1744
01:26:04,856 --> 01:26:06,619
That's the last thing
I need in the worid.

1745
01:26:06,691 --> 01:26:08,591

Are you kidding?

01:26:10,294 --> 01:26:12,888
Hey, man, you have a couple
Of hundred bucks?

For the craps tables.

01:26:16,768 --> 01:26:17,735
No.

1750
01:26:17,802 --> 01:26:18,894
No?

1751
01:26:18,970 --> 01:26:20,062
Come on!
Just a little bit.

1752
01:26:20,138 --> 01:26:22,606
This is my first trip
To vegas.

1753
01:26:22,673 --> 01:26:24,834
Try guy.
He's a sucker.

1754
01:26:24,909 --> 01:26:26,809
Well, that was
Very nice.

1755
01:26:26,878 --> 01:26:30,541
Whitey, can you spot me
Some blackjack cash?

1756
01:26:30,615 --> 01:26:32,276
That would be
Against my policy.

1757
01:26:32,350 --> 01:26:34,384
Mr. White,
It isn't true.

1758
01:26:34,517 --> 01:26:36,576
Oh ho
Ho ho!

1759
01:26:36,652 --> 01:26:37,880
Guy, can I borrow
Some money?

1760
01:26:37,954 --> 01:26:39,888
200 bucks.
How much you want?

1761
01:26:39,956 --> 01:26:42,390
Hah. Chump change.

1762
01:26:43,926 --> 01:26:46,451
Good lord, faye,
You look gorgeous.

1763
01:26:49,265 --> 01:26:51,495
Now, next up
For you kids...

1764
01:26:51,567 --> 01:26:53,865
You get to make
Another record.

1765
01:26:53,936 --> 01:26:56,234
Can I say
Something?

1766
01:26:56,305 --> 01:26:58,239
Hey, the fair faye
Wishes to address us all,

1767
01:26:58,307 --> 01:26:59,706
So it's...

1768
01:27:01,878 --> 01:27:05,541
Jimmy...

1769
01:27:05,615 --> 01:27:08,049
From now on,
You stay away from me.

1770
01:27:12,955 --> 01:27:18,359
I have wasted thousands
And thousands of kisses on you.

1771
01:27:18,428 --> 01:27:22,262
Kisses that I thought
Were special because
Of your lips and your smile

1772
01:27:22,331 --> 01:27:25,664
And all your
Color and life.

1773
01:27:25,735 --> 01:27:29,330
I used to think that was the real you
When you smiled.

1774
01:27:29,405 --> 01:27:32,841
But now I know that you
Don't mean any of it,

1775
01:27:32,909 --> 01:27:35,605
And you just save it
For all your songs.

1776
01:27:42,785 --> 01:27:48,280
Shame on me for kissing you
With my eyes closed so tight.

1777
01:28:00,069 --> 01:28:02,731
Should've dumped you
In pittsburgh!

1778
01:28:04,373 --> 01:28:06,671
Which one of you butts
Said we were engaged?

1779
01:28:10,646 --> 01:28:14,104
The same person who said
You had class,jimmy.

1780
01:28:17,119 --> 01:28:18,484
Let's blow, babe.

1781
01:28:18,554 --> 01:28:20,146
Get that desert air
In my hair.

1782
01:28:20,223 --> 01:28:21,884
Ok.

1783
01:28:21,958 --> 01:28:24,449
Do we really have to go
With the top down?

1784
01:28:35,872 --> 01:28:38,306
Take those stupid
Sunglasses off.

1785
01:28:46,616 --> 01:28:49,551
Why couldn't you
Have dumped her in pittsburgh?

1786
01:28:57,293 --> 01:29:00,387
We do my songs,
Or we don't record anything.

1787
01:29:00,463 --> 01:29:02,795
You got that, white?

1788
01:29:05,001 --> 01:29:07,595
Ok.jimmy.

1789
01:29:07,670 --> 01:29:09,729
I was looking forward
To working with you.

1790
01:29:09,805 --> 01:29:12,433
You know,
You're a liar, white!

1791
01:29:12,508 --> 01:29:14,135
You're a liar.

1792
01:29:14,210 --> 01:29:15,734
And you're in
A tough spot,jimmy,

1793
01:29:15,811 --> 01:29:18,746
'Cause you didn't read
The play-tone contract
That you yourself signed,

1794
01:29:18,814 --> 01:29:21,908
Because it says
You do what I say.

1795
01:29:21,984 --> 01:29:25,476
And I say you cover
These songs from
The play-tone catalog.

1796
01:29:25,555 --> 01:29:27,716
You record that thing you do
In spanish.

1797
01:29:27,790 --> 01:29:30,258
You get one cut
Per side of the lp,

1798
01:29:30,326 --> 01:29:32,590
But I don't want any of
This lover's lament crap.

1799
01:29:32,662 --> 01:29:35,597
I want something peppy,
Something happy,
Something up-tempo.

1800
01:29:35,665 --> 01:29:38,759
I want something snappy.

1801
01:29:48,878 --> 01:29:50,004
All right.

1802
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:53,514
I...

1803
01:29:53,583 --> 01:29:55,016
I quit

1804
01:29:55,084 --> 01:29:56,779
I quit

1805
01:29:56,852 --> 01:29:57,944
I quit

1806
01:30:00,022 --> 01:30:01,649
I quit, mr. White.

1807
01:30:16,238 --> 01:30:17,569
Jimmy just quit.

1808
01:30:19,475 --> 01:30:22,706
Your band is
Falling apart, guy.

1809
01:30:22,778 --> 01:30:23,904
Where's lenny?

1810
01:30:23,980 --> 01:30:26,141
I have no idea.

1811
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:34,083
I am so happy!

1812
01:30:36,058 --> 01:30:37,958
Oh, I can't wait
For tonight!

1813
01:30:38,027 --> 01:30:40,018
Oh, yeah!
Thanks so much.

1814
01:30:40,096 --> 01:30:41,529
I really-
Thanks a lot!

1815
01:30:41,597 --> 01:30:43,428
Thanks
For being here!

1816
01:30:43,499 --> 01:30:44,466
Thanks for
Sharing!

1817
01:30:44,533 --> 01:30:46,797
Oh, wow, I'm really so happy.

1818
01:30:46,869 --> 01:30:49,736
Well, I guess
You don't need me today.

1819
01:30:49,805 --> 01:30:51,830
Yeah. Wolfman,
Thank you very much.

1820
01:30:51,907 --> 01:30:53,272
You're a good man,
Scott pell.

1821
01:30:53,342 --> 01:30:55,276
Give me a call
Later on in the week.

1822
01:30:55,344 --> 01:30:56,777
We'll do something.

1823
01:30:59,015 --> 01:31:00,573
I can't believe this.

1824
01:31:03,185 --> 01:31:06,450
The wonders are
In breach of contract.

1825
01:31:06,522 --> 01:31:08,513
I'm sorry.

1826
01:31:08,591 --> 01:31:10,183
I'm really sorry,
Mr. White.

1827
01:31:13,229 --> 01:31:16,630
Well, don't worry.
No one's going to prison, son.

1828
01:31:17,667 --> 01:31:20,067
It's a very common tale.

1829
01:31:20,136 --> 01:31:22,263
Well, maybe for you,
But I was in a band,

1830
01:31:22,338 --> 01:31:24,363
And we still have
A hit record.

1831
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:26,169
Yeah, you do.

1832
01:31:26,242 --> 01:31:28,107
One-hit wonders.

1833
01:31:28,177 --> 01:31:30,509
It's a very
Common tale.

1834
01:31:34,583 --> 01:31:37,416
My first time in
A real recording studio.

1835
01:31:38,888 --> 01:31:40,685
You want to hang
Around for a while?

1836
01:31:40,756 --> 01:31:41,814
Ok by me.

1837
01:31:41,891 --> 01:31:44,860
But you're out of the hotel
This afternoon.

1838
01:31:44,927 --> 01:31:47,157
Can't help that.

1839
01:31:50,566 --> 01:31:53,091
You know, guy, horace
Was right about you.

1840
01:31:53,169 --> 01:31:54,830
You are the smart one.

1841
01:31:54,904 --> 01:31:56,633
Lenny is the fool.

1842
01:31:56,706 --> 01:32:00,608
Jimmy is...the talent.

1843
01:32:00,676 --> 01:32:02,439
Faye is...

1844
01:32:04,580 --> 01:32:07,378
Well, now, faye is
Special, isn't she?

1845
01:32:13,489 --> 01:32:16,049
And you are
The smart one.

1846
01:32:17,426 --> 01:32:19,656
That's what
I think anyway.

1847
01:34:00,629 --> 01:34:02,187
How you been?

1848
01:34:02,264 --> 01:34:03,663
Doing all right.
How about you?

1849
01:34:03,732 --> 01:34:05,063
All right.
Hanging in.

1850
01:34:22,117 --> 01:34:25,416
what do you call that?

1851
01:34:29,558 --> 01:34:31,458
/ am spartacus.

1852
01:34:31,527 --> 01:34:34,394
Ha ha ha!
You wanna lay it down?

1853
01:34:35,764 --> 01:34:37,994
Nah. I was just
Goofing around.

1854
01:34:41,971 --> 01:34:43,802
Hey, my man.

1855
01:34:46,008 --> 01:34:47,339
Hey, del!

1856
01:34:49,144 --> 01:34:50,668
What's your name again?

1857
01:34:50,746 --> 01:34:53,613
Guy...uh,
Guy patterson.

1858
01:34:53,682 --> 01:34:57,482
Guy. Yeah,
That's right.

1859
01:34:57,553 --> 01:34:59,248
Hey, you're good.

1860
01:34:59,321 --> 01:35:00,982
Oh, you heard that?

1861
01:35:01,056 --> 01:35:02,489
Swing.

1862
01:35:03,726 --> 01:35:04,658
Thank you.

1863
01:35:04,727 --> 01:35:07,855
Uh, can I jam
With you a bit?

1864
01:35:07,930 --> 01:35:09,397
You want to jam
With me?

1865
01:35:09,465 --> 01:35:11,695
Why not?

1866
01:35:14,103 --> 01:35:16,594
Sure. Sure.

1867
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,171
All right.

1868
01:35:19,241 --> 01:35:22,039
What are you
Doing here?

1869
01:35:22,111 --> 01:35:25,137
Recording some tracks in studio c
With willy walker.

1870
01:35:25,214 --> 01:35:28,183
Willy walker?

1871
01:35:28,250 --> 01:35:29,842
Can he jam
With us, too?

1872
01:35:29,919 --> 01:35:32,945
Nah, let's keep
This a duet.

1873
01:35:33,022 --> 01:35:35,547
Let's play that spartacus again.

1874
01:35:37,259 --> 01:35:38,749
Hey, ernie...

1875
01:35:38,827 --> 01:35:40,886
Roll tape on this.

1876
01:35:40,963 --> 01:35:42,931
You got it, del.

1877
01:35:42,998 --> 01:35:44,056
Go ahead.
Count it off.

1878
01:35:44,133 --> 01:35:46,328
1...2...3...4.

1879
01:36:19,969 --> 01:36:21,129
Hey!

1880
01:36:21,203 --> 01:36:23,535
Yeah. I'll talk
To you later.

1881
01:36:23,605 --> 01:36:25,470
Hey, hey, hey.
Slow down there, young squire.

1882
01:36:25,541 --> 01:36:26,530
Life is long.

1883
01:36:26,608 --> 01:36:27,836
I got to check out.

1884
01:36:27,910 --> 01:36:29,468
Oh, you're leaving us
Today, too, huh?

1885
01:36:29,545 --> 01:36:30,773
Yeah, well, that
Partner of yours-

1886
01:36:30,846 --> 01:36:31,835
The one with all
The attitude?

1887
01:36:31,914 --> 01:36:33,142
He left here hours ago.

1888
01:36:33,215 --> 01:36:35,683
And your little fifi
Is about to vamoose as well.

1889
01:36:37,052 --> 01:36:39,282
Wait, fifi-you mean faye.
Is she still here?

1890
01:36:39,355 --> 01:36:42,256
Yeah. She's sitting there
In the coffee shop.

1891
01:36:42,324 --> 01:36:44,383
At the counter. Alone.

1892
01:36:44,460 --> 01:36:46,121
Now, where I come from,
That just ain't right.

1893
01:36:46,195 --> 01:36:47,594
Take that.

1894
01:36:47,663 --> 01:36:49,631
lamarr here.

1895
01:36:49,698 --> 01:36:50,892
Yes, sir.
Blue impala.

1896
01:36:50,966 --> 01:36:53,093
Absolutely.
Uh-huh.

1897
01:36:54,737 --> 01:36:56,102
Thank you, sir.

1898
01:36:56,171 --> 01:36:58,662
Hey, hey, hey!
Now, that ain't your job.

1899
01:37:00,109 --> 01:37:03,567
Del says I got the chops to make it
As a drummer in l.a.

1900
01:37:03,645 --> 01:37:06,614
- oh.
- so I think I'm gonna
Give it a try.

1901
01:37:06,682 --> 01:37:08,650
Really?

1902
01:37:11,553 --> 01:37:16,320
So, you're-you're gonna be
A permanent west coaster?

1903
01:37:16,392 --> 01:37:18,417
Yeah, it looks
That way.

1904
01:37:18,494 --> 01:37:19,825
Wow.

1905
01:37:23,032 --> 01:37:24,829
So, what are you
Gonna do?

1906
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:26,959
Hmm...

1907
01:37:29,238 --> 01:37:31,001
I'm gonna
Go back to erie.

1908
01:37:34,710 --> 01:37:36,837
Figured that's
What you'd say.

1909
01:37:41,617 --> 01:37:43,141
Guy...

1910
01:37:43,218 --> 01:37:44,947
Can I ask you
A question?

1911
01:37:46,422 --> 01:37:47,548
Shoot.

1912
01:37:49,825 --> 01:37:51,417
Were you in love
In erie?

1913
01:37:54,463 --> 01:37:56,931
You know,
I thought so.

1914
01:37:56,999 --> 01:37:58,728
With that
Tina woman?

1915
01:38:00,035 --> 01:38:01,969
She wasn't right
For you.

1916
01:38:06,008 --> 01:38:07,566
Was she
A good kisser?

1917
01:38:07,643 --> 01:38:11,636
Yeah.

1918
01:38:11,713 --> 01:38:13,203
Yeah?

1919
01:38:13,282 --> 01:38:17,742
It would be ungentlemanly
For me to elaborate.

1920
01:38:19,121 --> 01:38:22,249
Gentlemen- I forgot what you
Fellas looked like.

1921
01:38:25,527 --> 01:38:28,257
Well, sir...

1922
01:38:28,330 --> 01:38:31,128
If you ever
Come back to erie,

1923
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:33,259
Please stop by
And see me.

1924
01:38:35,003 --> 01:38:36,766
Right. We'll listen
To records.

1925
01:38:36,839 --> 01:38:40,036
That'd be nice.

1926
01:38:40,109 --> 01:38:42,600
And here's good-bye.

1927
01:38:46,181 --> 01:38:49,981
You know that none
Of this would have happened

1928
01:38:50,052 --> 01:38:53,180
If you hadn't
Joined the band.

1929
01:38:53,255 --> 01:38:55,314
And I mean that
In a good way.

1930
01:39:06,034 --> 01:39:07,092
Bye.

1931
01:39:42,371 --> 01:39:44,532
So, young squire...

1932
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:53,748
Before you go...

1933
01:39:53,815 --> 01:39:56,113
Let me ask you
One question.

1934
01:39:56,185 --> 01:39:57,243
Shoot.

1935
01:39:59,021 --> 01:40:01,990
When was the last time you were
Decently kissed?

1936
01:40:03,258 --> 01:40:07,854
I mean, truly, truly...
Good and kissed?

1937
01:40:14,403 --> 01:40:17,065
Dave gammelgard...

1938
01:40:17,139 --> 01:40:19,300
New year's eve...

1939
01:40:19,374 --> 01:40:20,841
'61.

1940
01:40:27,149 --> 01:40:28,548
Ok.

1941
01:40:30,586 --> 01:40:31,678
Mm!

1942
01:41:08,390 --> 01:41:10,483
Whoo.

1943
01:41:14,663 --> 01:41:16,096
Whoo.

1944
01:41:18,033 --> 01:41:20,399
We should have done that
A long time ago.

1945
01:41:24,039 --> 01:41:25,563
Yeah.

1946
01:41:41,056 --> 01:41:42,956
Lamarr, would you mind
Watching our things?

1947
01:41:43,025 --> 01:41:45,493
Oh, that's
What I do.

1948
01:42:07,848 --> 01:42:09,907
I never thought my life

1949
01:42:09,984 --> 01:42:14,546
Would end up
Quite this way

1950
01:42:14,621 --> 01:42:17,556
Sometimes
It's hard to figure out

1951
01:42:17,624 --> 01:42:21,492
What I should say

1952
01:42:21,562 --> 01:42:27,296
I tried alone
To mend this broken heart

1953
01:42:27,368 --> 01:42:30,895
I need you

1954
01:42:30,971 --> 01:42:36,136
That thing you do

1955
01:42:38,312 --> 01:42:39,711
When we're apart

1956
01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:45,013
I find it very hard
To smile

1957
01:42:45,085 --> 01:42:47,110
You know that
Other giris

1958
01:42:47,187 --> 01:42:51,749
Have never been
My style

1959
01:42:51,825 --> 01:42:54,692
Well, there's a feeling
That I get

1960
01:42:54,762 --> 01:42:57,560
When I'm near you

1961
01:42:57,631 --> 01:43:01,362
I need you

1962
01:43:01,435 --> 01:43:05,098
That thing you do

1963
01:43:08,876 --> 01:43:11,504
I could search
Around the worid

1964
01:43:11,578 --> 01:43:15,605
Only to find

1965
01:43:15,682 --> 01:43:17,616
The only thing I need

1966
01:43:17,684 --> 01:43:24,988
Is you right by my side

1967
01:43:35,903 --> 01:43:38,269
There's a feeling
That I get

1968
01:43:38,338 --> 01:43:41,501
When I'm with you

1969
01:43:41,575 --> 01:43:45,375
Oh, oh, oh

1970
01:43:45,446 --> 01:43:49,405
That thing you do

1971
01:43:49,483 --> 01:43:51,951
I could search
Around the worid

1972
01:43:52,019 --> 01:43:56,012
Only to find

1973
01:43:56,090 --> 01:43:58,285
The only thing I need

1974
01:43:58,358 --> 01:44:02,954
Is you right by my side

1975
01:44:03,030 --> 01:44:04,964
I never thought my life

1976
01:44:05,032 --> 01:44:09,435
Would end up
Quite this way

1977
01:44:09,503 --> 01:44:12,370
Sometimes it's hard
To figure out

1978
01:44:12,439 --> 01:44:16,307
What I should say

1979
01:44:16,376 --> 01:44:22,178
I've tried alone
To mend this broken heart

1980
01:44:22,249 --> 01:44:25,707
I need you

1981
01:44:25,786 --> 01:44:29,916
That thing you do

1982
01:44:29,990 --> 01:44:32,720
I need you

1983
01:44:32,793 --> 01:44:40,564
That thing you do

1984
01:44:47,207 --> 01:44:53,043
I've never known
Someone like this

1985
01:44:53,113 --> 01:44:57,846
She's got a look
I can't resist

1986
01:44:57,918 --> 01:45:01,285
I know

1987
01:45:01,355 --> 01:45:04,813
In just a little while

1988
01:45:04,892 --> 01:45:10,797
I'll be the one
That makes her smile

1989
01:45:10,864 --> 01:45:16,734
Her parents say
That I'm no good

1990
01:45:16,803 --> 01:45:21,536
I don't come
From her neighborhood

1991
01:45:21,608 --> 01:45:24,839
Ohh

1992
01:45:24,912 --> 01:45:29,474
Before too long
They'll see though

1993
01:45:29,550 --> 01:45:34,578
Just what
She sees in me

1994
01:45:34,655 --> 01:45:37,522
But when
She holds my hand

1995
01:45:37,591 --> 01:45:42,688
I think
She understands

1996
01:45:42,763 --> 01:45:44,560
She knows it

1997
01:45:57,110 --> 01:46:00,204
It's true

1998
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:04,114
It might take
A little while

1999
01:46:04,184 --> 01:46:10,020
I'll be the one
That makes her smile

2000
01:46:10,090 --> 01:46:12,991
But when
She holds my hand

2001
01:46:13,060 --> 01:46:18,191
I think
She understands

2002
01:46:18,265 --> 01:46:21,928
She knows it

2003
01:46:22,002 --> 01:46:25,335
She knows

2004
01:46:25,405 --> 01:46:28,533
She knows

2005
01:46:28,609 --> 01:46:30,133
She knows

2006
01:46:30,210 --> 01:46:34,169
She knows
All my hopes and dreams

2007
01:46:34,248 --> 01:46:37,046
She knows

2008
01:46:37,117 --> 01:46:39,881
She knows

2009
01:46:39,953 --> 01:46:41,682
She knows

2010
01:46:41,755 --> 01:46:45,555
She means
Everything to me

2011
01:46:45,626 --> 01:46:51,622
Someday
I'm gonna make her see

2012
01:46:51,698 --> 01:46:56,294
How good together
We can be

2013
01:46:56,370 --> 01:46:59,464
It's true

2014
01:46:59,539 --> 01:47:03,373
It might take
A little time

2015
01:47:03,443 --> 01:47:09,279
One day I'm gonna
Make her mine

2016
01:47:09,349 --> 01:47:12,284
But when
She holds my hand

2017
01:47:12,352 --> 01:47:17,255
I think
She understands

2018
01:47:17,324 --> 01:47:20,350
She knows it

2019
01:47:20,427 --> 01:47:23,362
She knows it

2020
01:47:23,430 --> 01:47:25,295
She knows it
