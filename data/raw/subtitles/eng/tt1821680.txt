00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:41,625
love is calling.

00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:44,712
This flea collar you sold me ain't working!

Hmm. Really?

40
00:02:46,798 --> 00:02:49,300
Let me take a look at it, my dear friend.

00:02:49,342 --> 00:02:51,304
l'll fix it in just a second.

42
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:52,430
Ah, there it is.

43
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:55,475
Now, you'll have to excuse me,
l'm in a rush.

00:02:56,725 --> 00:02:58,144
Thank you!

45
00:03:05,821 --> 00:03:08,948

cos l hate birds!

- How dare you!

00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,558
Bye-bye.

53
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,404
They call me TC.

54
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:18,324
- Oh!
- It's short for Top Cat.

55
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:21,704
That's very clever.
l'm Trixie, which is short for...

56
00:04:21,745 --> 00:04:23,914
The future Mrs Top Cat?

57
00:04:23,956 --> 00:04:25,750
You're funny too.

58
00:04:25,792 --> 00:04:30,046
Too bad l have to go to work and too bad
l don't take anyone from the alley.

59
00:04:30,088 --> 00:04:33,551
l wasn't joking.
l think you've stolen my heart

60
00:04:33,592 --> 00:04:36,304
and l'm usually the one
who does the taking around here.

61
00:04:37,054 --> 00:04:38,141
Oh!

62
00:04:38,182 --> 00:04:40,183
ls that why he's so angry?

63
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,545
Now, where were we?

64
00:05:02,586 --> 00:05:03,920
Huh?

65
00:05:27,324 --> 00:05:29,327
TC: Oh, Benny, my boy!

66
00:05:30,994 --> 00:05:32,707
Hey, TC.

67
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:35,959
Oh, Benny, l am in love!

68
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,756
While you were out playing Romeo,
the waiter realised we were freeloading

69
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,008
and he chased me away.

70
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,136
The worst is, l'm still hungry.

71
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:48,434
Smells like you're making your famous
fish head, bottle cap, boot stew.

72
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:50,477
l just made my best batch yet.

73
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,654
Perfect!

74
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:00,739
Benny?

75
00:06:00,781 --> 00:06:04,328
Omicer Dibble!
What can we do for you today?

76
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,583
l've got a call from the Chez Snooty
about two freeloading cats.

77
00:06:08,623 --> 00:06:11,752
Oh! That is terrible!

78
00:06:11,794 --> 00:06:17,676
How could a crime ever be committed in this
city with the brave Omicer Dibble around?

79
00:06:17,718 --> 00:06:18,845
Cut it, TC.

80
00:06:18,886 --> 00:06:23,433
l'm up for an important promotion and l
want to make sure you don't mess it up.

81
00:06:23,475 --> 00:06:25,811
You offend me, Omicer Dibble.

82
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:30,150
Whatever you do, be sure to stay away
from Carnegie Hall.

83
00:06:30,191 --> 00:06:32,777
l'm talking too much. l'd better go.

84
00:06:32,818 --> 00:06:34,197
Carnegie Hall?

85
00:06:37,866 --> 00:06:42,164
Violinist Laszlo Laszlo is
performing tonight at Carnegie Hall.

86
00:06:42,204 --> 00:06:44,209
l love Laszlo Laszlo!

87
00:06:44,251 --> 00:06:48,797
He used to be a janitor
and he still cleans up after every show.

88
00:06:48,837 --> 00:06:54,555
Among the many expected to attend
is the Maharaja of Peekajoo...

89
00:06:54,595 --> 00:06:58,475
who's well-known
for giving away rubies as tips.

90
00:06:58,517 --> 00:07:00,061
Oh! Benny!

91
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:03,398
Those rubies are the answer
to all our problems.

92
00:07:03,438 --> 00:07:07,611
Trixie'll finally go
for an alley cat like me,

93
00:07:07,652 --> 00:07:10,324
when we're no longer living in the alley.

94
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:12,118
But l like living in the alley.

95
00:07:20,377 --> 00:07:21,754
Ah!

96
00:07:21,795 --> 00:07:23,797
B...l...N...G...

97
00:07:23,838 --> 00:07:27,427
Uh-oh. Must be TC.

98
00:07:43,571 --> 00:07:46,909
l'd love to go another round
but TC's calling.

99
00:07:46,951 --> 00:07:48,535
l gotta go.

100
00:07:49,953 --> 00:07:53,166
Promise me l'm the only girl in your life.

101
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,004
Yeah. Of course you are.

102
00:07:56,044 --> 00:07:58,672
We'll be together forever.

103
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,054
Hey, you promised me a romantic picnic
in the park!

104
00:08:03,095 --> 00:08:06,433
Honey, l was just getting up
to get you your present.

105
00:08:06,474 --> 00:08:09,519
Close your eyes and l'll give it to you.

106
00:08:11,354 --> 00:08:15,025
Oh, Fancy Fancy, you're the best!

107
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,195
Fancy?

108
00:08:17,905 --> 00:08:19,447
Aagh!

109
00:08:20,658 --> 00:08:25,162
l'm warning you for the last time:
stop copycatting me!

110
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:30,712
TC's calling. We'll finish this later.

111
00:08:33,005 --> 00:08:35,008
Choo-Choo, Spook...

112
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,012
Fancy Fancy...

113
00:08:37,052 --> 00:08:38,471
Brain.

114
00:08:38,553 --> 00:08:42,268
Everybody's here, TC,
except for Benny.

115
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:45,437
- You're Benny.
- Oh, yeah!

116
00:08:49,816 --> 00:08:51,612
Choo-Choo, turn that off.

117
00:08:51,653 --> 00:08:53,907
Now, men, listen up.

118
00:08:53,948 --> 00:09:00,580
The Maharaja of Peekajoo is in town
and that means his rubies are in town.

119
00:09:00,622 --> 00:09:05,252
And one ofthose things will be returning
to Peekajoo without the other.

120
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:11,428
But, TC, it says here that Omicer Dibble
is the Maharaja's police escort.

121
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:13,972
He'll never let you near his rubies.

122
00:09:14,014 --> 00:09:15,598
You're right, Choo-Choo.

123
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:19,479
Which is why l will not be attending
tonight's performance.

124
00:09:19,521 --> 00:09:23,650
Er...then how's he gonna get close
to the Maharaja?

125
00:09:23,692 --> 00:09:26,236
l will leave that up to...

126
00:09:29,658 --> 00:09:33,997
The Arabian oil king, Alley Kat!

127
00:09:34,122 --> 00:09:37,000
Hey! Where's TC?

128
00:09:47,763 --> 00:09:50,308
Stay close to me, Mr Maharaja.

129
00:09:50,348 --> 00:09:52,937
There's some shady characters
in these parts.

130
00:09:52,979 --> 00:09:57,107
For that tip, Omicer Dibble,
l'll give you a gift.

131
00:09:57,275 --> 00:09:58,901
No, thank you.

132
00:09:58,941 --> 00:10:03,491
Just being an honest officer ofthe law
is all the reward l need.

133
00:10:04,824 --> 00:10:08,121
Wow!
Did you see the size of that ruby?

134
00:10:08,162 --> 00:10:13,211
Poor Maharaja, having to carry all those
heavy priceless stones wherever he goes.

135
00:10:13,251 --> 00:10:15,004
What do you say we lighten his load?

136
00:10:17,715 --> 00:10:18,926
Uh-oh.

137
00:10:24,975 --> 00:10:27,477
The concert's, like, sold out, TC.

138
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,064
How are we, like, gonna get inside now?

139
00:10:30,105 --> 00:10:33,193
Er...we could steal
somebody else's tickets.

140
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,569
Hold it!

141
00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:38,908
My dear Brain, we are not common
cat burglars, we're con men!

142
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:41,119
Which means we live by a code.

143
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,789
We only steal from people
who deserve to be stolen from.

144
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:47,125
Outta my way, you jerks!

145
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,295
You make me sick, all of you!

146
00:10:49,337 --> 00:10:50,964
Like him.

147
00:10:51,006 --> 00:10:54,010
The name's Strickland.
l bought tickets online.

148
00:10:54,051 --> 00:10:57,638
Oh, yes, Mr Strickland.
Is the rest of your party here?

149
00:10:58,137 --> 00:11:00,475
l am my party, nitwit!

150
00:11:00,517 --> 00:11:04,356
l bought the seat in front of me,
the one behind me, the one on my left

151
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,149
and the one on my right,

152
00:11:06,189 --> 00:11:12,322
so l don't have to be anywhere near nosey,
annoying, obnoxious people like you!

153
00:11:14,868 --> 00:11:17,579
- Tickets, please.
- What do you mean, tickets?

154
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,000
l thought they collected them at the door.

155
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,879
Yes, sir, but for extra special VIPs
like yourself,

156
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,048
we have a complimentary
kerbside check-in.

157
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:30,720
Yeah, that's right. l am a VIP.

158
00:11:30,762 --> 00:11:34,726
l bet l'm the best-looking VIP
you ever saw, too!

159
00:11:34,766 --> 00:11:37,269
Uh...of course.

160
00:11:37,311 --> 00:11:42,817
l'll be back but momentarily with a golden
chariot to bring you to your seat.

161
00:11:42,857 --> 00:11:44,153
Uh...good.

162
00:11:46,322 --> 00:11:49,118
Gentlemen, who wants to see a show?

163
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,290
Hm♪ Hm♪ Hm?

164
00:11:57,334 --> 00:12:00,340
Where's that golden chariot
to take me to my seat?

165
00:12:00,382 --> 00:12:01,673
Chariot?

166
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:03,300
Beat it, weirdo!

167
00:12:04,052 --> 00:12:06,972
You can't treat me like this! l'm a VIP!

168
00:12:07,013 --> 00:12:08,098
Agh!

169
00:12:17,901 --> 00:12:20,114
Mm, now that was a very brief show, boss.

170
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:24,493
Never mind the concert, Trixie.
Now you, let's move it!

171
00:12:37,676 --> 00:12:40,930
TC, how are we gonna get
past Omicer Dibble?

172
00:12:40,971 --> 00:12:45,060
Don't worry, Benny, my boy, he has some
pressing business to attend to.

173
00:12:45,102 --> 00:12:48,730
CHOO-CHOO:
Candy, programmes, souvenirs!

174
00:12:48,771 --> 00:12:51,443
Candy, programmes, souvenirs!

175
00:12:51,485 --> 00:12:53,361
l'll buy a programme, young man.

176
00:12:56,157 --> 00:12:58,242
Hey! This is for the zoo!

177
00:12:58,284 --> 00:13:01,455
Candy, programmes, souvenirs!

178
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,498
Three dollars for a candy bar, ma'am?

179
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:05,502
That sounds reasonable.

180
00:13:05,543 --> 00:13:07,879
Candy for three dollars!
Do l hear four dollars?

181
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:10,006
- What?
- Four dollars! Do l hear ten?

182
00:13:10,046 --> 00:13:12,051
Ten dollars! Do l hear 20?

183
00:13:12,093 --> 00:13:15,847
Candy for 50 dollars!
Going once, going twice...

184
00:13:15,888 --> 00:13:17,765
1 OO dollars!

185
00:13:18,183 --> 00:13:21,772
lfthe Chief finds out about this,
l'll be fired.

186
00:13:21,812 --> 00:13:25,065
Excuse me, sir.
l need to tend to some hooligans.

187
00:13:25,107 --> 00:13:26,527
l'll be right back.

188
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,362
ls this seat taken?

189
00:13:29,404 --> 00:13:34,161
- Actually...
- l am Sheik Alley Kat.

190
00:13:34,202 --> 00:13:37,248
And this is my associate, Shabby Sheik.

191
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:40,209
- My name is the Maharaja of...
- Of Peekajoo!

192
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:42,963
We met during the thingamabob
at the what's-it-called,

193
00:13:43,004 --> 00:13:44,339
hosted by who's-his-face.

194
00:13:44,381 --> 00:13:47,093
The coronation of Princess Gilmar
at the Royal Gardens

195
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,803
hosted by His Highness
Sir Kingsley Featherstone Xll?

196
00:13:49,845 --> 00:13:52,308
- That's the one!
- Funny.

197
00:13:52,349 --> 00:13:54,893
l don't remember you
in any of my pictures.

198
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:58,147
Do you mind if l cross-reference you
with my photo library?

199
00:13:59,065 --> 00:14:02,153
Hey there, Maj, what's that doohickey?

200
00:14:02,193 --> 00:14:05,948
l own a tech company and this is
a prototype for our latest product,

201
00:14:05,989 --> 00:14:07,743
the Maharajaton 5000.

202
00:14:07,783 --> 00:14:10,870
lt's a phone, camera,
MP3 player, clock, microphone,

203
00:14:10,911 --> 00:14:13,708
flashlight, portable fan,
pencil holder, paperweight,

204
00:14:13,749 --> 00:14:15,960
hairdryer, hoverboard, suitcase...

205
00:14:16,962 --> 00:14:19,465
A suitcase♪ For what?

206
00:14:19,506 --> 00:14:21,717
So you can carry it wherever you go.

207
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:24,513
lt also reminds me
of important appointments.

208
00:14:24,554 --> 00:14:27,684
Attention.
The pe_ormance is about to begin.

209
00:14:30,977 --> 00:14:32,982
Yeay!

210
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,291
Oh! Such beautiful music.

211
00:14:47,332 --> 00:14:49,084
He's not so bad.

212
00:14:49,124 --> 00:14:51,628
l wouldn't be surprised
if he missed a note.

213
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,008
How dare you?
Laszlo Laszlo never misses a note.

214
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,845
l would stake all of my rubies on it!

215
00:14:57,886 --> 00:15:00,848
l'll take that bet and offer you uh...

216
00:15:01,848 --> 00:15:03,810
..my friend Shabby Sheik here!

217
00:15:03,851 --> 00:15:06,687
First-rate best pal
and servant to the stars.

218
00:15:06,728 --> 00:15:09,608
Does he do Windows?
Windows Vista?

219
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,821
Sure.
Whatever that is...he does it!

220
00:15:12,862 --> 00:15:14,199
Deal!

221
00:15:14,696 --> 00:15:16,241
Everything's in place.

222
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:18,286
Right, Benny?

223
00:15:20,204 --> 00:15:22,207
Sorry, something in my eye.

224
00:15:22,248 --> 00:15:24,252
What was the question again?

225
00:15:24,294 --> 00:15:26,045
Are the guys in position?

226
00:15:26,087 --> 00:15:28,089
Oh, oh, right.

227
00:15:48,195 --> 00:15:50,908
Of all the completely unexpected things
to happen.

228
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:53,412
Laszlo Laszlo missed a note!

229
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:59,712
Sheikh Alley Cat, l am so very
ashamed and embarrassed.

230
00:15:59,753 --> 00:16:02,755
l've given all of my rubies away as tips!

231
00:16:08,303 --> 00:16:09,306
Huh?

232
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,646
Look, don't uh...
don't worry about it, Maj.

233
00:16:14,688 --> 00:16:16,230
We have to be going, anyway.

234
00:16:16,272 --> 00:16:18,900
But l'm enjoying the concert, TC.

235
00:16:18,941 --> 00:16:21,028
- Come on!
- Please, Sheikh Alley Cat,

236
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:25,658
l insist you take the Maharajaton 5000
in place ofthe rubies.

237
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:27,785
You'll find it much more valuable.

238
00:16:28,452 --> 00:16:31,499
Why?
Does it turn into a bag of rubies, too?

239
00:16:39,091 --> 00:16:40,926
Hiya, Omicer Dibble!

240
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,761
Benny?

241
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:45,850
Which means this must be Top Cat!

242
00:16:46,642 --> 00:16:50,897
Please, Omicer Dibble,
Iet's handle this like adults, huh?

243
00:16:54,401 --> 00:16:57,322
There goes my promotion!
Top Cat!

244
00:16:58,155 --> 00:16:59,992
Come back here!

245
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:02,035
♪ Flight Of The Bumble Bee

246
00:17:08,585 --> 00:17:10,588
Hey, TC, come back here!

247
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,423
Are you trying to get me fired?

248
00:17:22,184 --> 00:17:23,393
Benny!

249
00:17:47,965 --> 00:17:49,967
Hold on, Benny, my boy!

250
00:17:59,897 --> 00:18:01,900
Why, you...

251
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,198
Aagh!

252
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:13,121
Thanks a lot, fellas.

253
00:18:13,163 --> 00:18:15,248
Now l'm never gonna become chief.

254
00:18:16,334 --> 00:18:18,670
Omicer Dibble, l didn't know you cooked.

255
00:18:18,752 --> 00:18:20,755
Chief! Not chef!

256
00:18:20,837 --> 00:18:23,050
That's why l've been working overtime,

257
00:18:23,091 --> 00:18:25,176
to impress the Chiefwho's retiring.

258
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:27,889
But now l'll never get the job.

259
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:35,480
Omicer Dibble speaking.

260
00:18:41,071 --> 00:18:43,908
Omicer Dibble speaking.

261
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,951
Oh, hello, Chief.

262
00:18:48,122 --> 00:18:50,415
l imagine you saw the paper.

263
00:18:53,711 --> 00:18:55,714
You didn't see the paper?

264
00:18:55,754 --> 00:18:57,759
Yes, sir!

265
00:18:57,801 --> 00:18:59,510
l understand!

266
00:18:59,552 --> 00:19:00,761
Woo-hoo!

267
00:19:00,802 --> 00:19:05,266
l'm going to be the new police chief
of New York City!

268
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:08,230
Yeah!

269
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:13,110
You're welcome, Dibble.

270
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,779
lf it wasn't for us,
there'd be no crime for you to fight

271
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,283
and you'd never have gotten the promotion.

272
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:21,160
You can give us your first pay cheque.
How much is that?

273
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,956
Well, the Chief didn't exactly
offer me the job.

274
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:27,920
He just said, "Show up at the station
for an important announcement."

275
00:19:27,962 --> 00:19:29,588
What else could it be?

276
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:31,840
Finally!

277
00:19:31,923 --> 00:19:35,845
l won't have to put up with you cats
ever again!

278
00:19:37,012 --> 00:19:39,016
Ha, ha! Honey, it's me!

279
00:19:39,141 --> 00:19:41,143
You can buy that boat you wanted.

280
00:19:41,184 --> 00:19:44,815
And the flat screen TV
and the swimming pool.

281
00:19:44,855 --> 00:19:46,399
Hee hee!

282
00:19:47,526 --> 00:19:51,656
Can you believe our very own Omicer
Dibble is going to be chief of police?

283
00:19:52,198 --> 00:19:54,660
We should throw him a party!

284
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:02,335
But...TC, shouldn't we wait for Dibble
to get back first?

285
00:20:02,377 --> 00:20:04,922
l really don't see why that's necessary.

286
00:20:11,887 --> 00:20:16,227
Dibble, as you may have heard, l need
someone to take my place as police chief.

287
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:20,316
Someone who has experience,
someone whom l can trust,

288
00:20:20,691 --> 00:20:23,278
and someone whose voice is
slightly higher than normal.

289
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,029
l understand, Chief.

290
00:20:25,071 --> 00:20:27,866
Someone who was born on December 1 8th,

291
00:20:27,906 --> 00:20:30,828
who enjoys fly fishing,
tuna fish sandwiches,

292
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,415
and who keeps a lucky penny
in his right shoe.

293
00:20:34,793 --> 00:20:37,753
lt's for all these reasons and more

294
00:20:37,794 --> 00:20:42,634
that it's my privilege to offer you,
Omicer Dibble...

295
00:20:42,884 --> 00:20:45,221
..the first chance to meet
the new police chief,

296
00:20:45,261 --> 00:20:47,681
- Lou Strickland!
- What?

297
00:20:49,852 --> 00:20:53,690
Hello, Dibble.
l understand we have the same birthday.

298
00:20:53,815 --> 00:20:59,072
Lou doesn't have much police experience,
but he is my son-in-law and needed a job.

299
00:20:59,112 --> 00:21:02,450
Now if you'll excuse me,
l'm offto retire in Florida!

300
00:21:05,452 --> 00:21:09,626
Dibble, l know what you're thinking:
How can l workfor a man this handsome?

301
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,669
You'lljust have to get past that.

302
00:21:12,837 --> 00:21:14,632
You may also be wondering:

303
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:18,093
How can a man who has never worked
in a police station run one?

304
00:21:18,134 --> 00:21:21,681
And my answer is: computers.

305
00:21:21,723 --> 00:21:23,725
- Computers, sir?
- That's right.

306
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:25,729
ln the 30 seconds l've been chief,

307
00:21:25,769 --> 00:21:31,903
l've already replaced all your co-workers
with computers via computer.

308
00:21:36,533 --> 00:21:38,075
But why, sir?

309
00:21:38,117 --> 00:21:42,582
Because machines don't make mistakes.

310
00:21:42,623 --> 00:21:44,793
People make mistakes.

311
00:21:44,835 --> 00:21:46,545
That's not always true.

312
00:21:46,585 --> 00:21:49,758
See, you're wrong!
And youjust proved my point.

313
00:21:50,425 --> 00:21:52,218
l hate to bring it up, but...

314
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,303
why didn't you fire me?

315
00:21:54,345 --> 00:21:57,725
Well, l need someone to turn on
the computers.

316
00:21:57,766 --> 00:22:03,523
Plus, since we share the same birthday,
it'd make thejoint party uncomfortable.

317
00:22:03,564 --> 00:22:05,568
- Oh.
- l knowwhat you're thinking:

318
00:22:05,609 --> 00:22:08,153
Did he evenjust get more handsome?

319
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10,115
The answer is yes. Yes, l did.

320
00:22:10,157 --> 00:22:12,367
That's what power does to a man.

321
00:22:12,408 --> 00:22:16,831
Now, l'd love to chat,
but l have a surprise inspection of...

322
00:22:16,872 --> 00:22:18,457
your beat.

323
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:20,419
Agh!

324
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,402
Huh?

325
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:45,240
Dibble, you're back!

326
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:49,661
Pardon me for not rising, but l haven't
felt this ill since l had blubberitis.

327
00:22:50,873 --> 00:22:53,958
ls this what you call good police work,
Dibble?

328
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,671
- Sir, you don't understand.
- l understand perfectly.

329
00:22:57,712 --> 00:23:00,175
You've been slacking on your job!

330
00:23:00,217 --> 00:23:02,929
Hey!
Like, you can't talk to him like that!

331
00:23:02,969 --> 00:23:05,515
He's, like, the Chief of, like, Police.

332
00:23:05,555 --> 00:23:07,435
l'm the Chief of Police!

333
00:23:08,393 --> 00:23:10,061
But if you're not chief,

334
00:23:10,103 --> 00:23:13,066
how are youse gonna afford
all that stuff you bought?

335
00:23:13,106 --> 00:23:14,650
Ohh!

336
00:23:16,737 --> 00:23:20,658
Please, Chief Strickland,
give me another chance!

337
00:23:20,698 --> 00:23:24,745
Strickland♪ Hey, you're the guy we
ripped off at the Laszlo Laszlo concert.

338
00:23:24,787 --> 00:23:28,167
Remember, TC,
he fell for it hook, line, and...

339
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:31,296
- Benny, shh!
- No need to quiet him, Top Cat.

340
00:23:31,338 --> 00:23:33,173
l know exactly who you are!

341
00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:38,053
l'm going to show you what happens
when you mess with Strickland.

342
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:44,978
Oh, how l love it when you're angry.

343
00:23:46,563 --> 00:23:50,276
Chief Strickland, l'm sure it was
all just a misunder... Whoa!

344
00:23:50,318 --> 00:23:51,444
What the...?

345
00:23:51,485 --> 00:23:54,866
You think l'd actually go inside
your filthy, filthy alley?

346
00:23:54,907 --> 00:23:57,828
l'm a hologram.

347
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:04,961
Dibble, you report back to my body
at the office, immediately.

348
00:24:05,502 --> 00:24:07,090
As for you,

349
00:24:07,131 --> 00:24:10,717
l will deal with you soon enough!

350
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:20,438
How do l shut this thing off?

351
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:22,107
Oh, yeah.

352
00:24:33,203 --> 00:24:36,457
Thank you so much for letting me
keep my job, sir.

353
00:24:36,499 --> 00:24:40,671
Yeah, well, l don't want to waste
my computers' time on unimportant tasks,

354
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:43,175
so l'm giving them all to you.

355
00:24:43,216 --> 00:24:47,470
Trixie, show Omicer Dibble
his new tasks and office.

356
00:24:47,511 --> 00:24:50,016
Omice♪ Thank you very much, sir.

357
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,896
Maybe all these changes
will be for the better.

358
00:24:53,938 --> 00:24:55,356
Oh, of course.

359
00:24:55,397 --> 00:24:58,068
Strickland will turn this town
into a better place.

360
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:01,029
And now, this is your office.

361
00:25:07,536 --> 00:25:09,247
At least l've got a window.

362
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:16,131
Start with the files on your desk
and don't disturb Gerry.

363
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:20,928
Hi, l'm Gerry.

364
00:25:20,969 --> 00:25:22,554
Candy bar?

365
00:25:22,595 --> 00:25:27,101
- Thanks, l'd love one.
- No, l meant do you have one?

366
00:25:27,142 --> 00:25:31,023
Strickland doesn't allow me
to take snack breaks. l'm starving.

367
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,992
ls it true, TC?

368
00:25:39,033 --> 00:25:41,494
ls Dibble really gone away forever?

369
00:25:41,535 --> 00:25:43,455
Well, l'm afraid so, Brain.

370
00:25:44,414 --> 00:25:48,085
Hey, aren't you supposed to be
holding up the ladder?

371
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,179
Whoa!

372
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:00,809
Luckily cats always land on their...

373
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:07,983
l'm, like, totally gonna miss Dibble.
He was, like, a cool cat

374
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,821
Yes, yes, he was.

375
00:26:09,863 --> 00:26:13,448
But now that Dibble's gone,
we have free rein of Hoagie's Alley.

376
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:15,745
We can play as many scams as we want,

377
00:26:15,786 --> 00:26:19,624
have all-night parties,
come and go as much as we please.

378
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:23,545
But, TC, isn't that what we did
when Dibble was around?

379
00:26:23,586 --> 00:26:24,713
Good point, Benny.

380
00:26:24,754 --> 00:26:28,884
lt was easy living before,
and it'll be even easier living now.

381
00:26:29,969 --> 00:26:31,054
Whoa!

382
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,191
This is ridiculous.

383
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:44,445
l knew Strickland was a tyrant
but this is shocking!

384
00:26:44,486 --> 00:26:46,198
Yee-ee-aaargh!

385
00:26:48,157 --> 00:26:51,662
Let's just keep that little bit of irony
to ourselves, shall we?

386
00:26:51,702 --> 00:26:56,709
- What are we supposed to do now, TC?
- Oooh, maybe we can go to the zoo!

387
00:26:56,751 --> 00:26:59,128
They have a new 800-pound gorilla!

388
00:27:00,547 --> 00:27:01,715
Hm.

389
00:27:04,175 --> 00:27:06,805
l can see my house from here!

390
00:27:06,846 --> 00:27:10,352
And you'll notice it's safe and sound,
Mr Mayor.

391
00:27:10,392 --> 00:27:14,939
With technology, l can keep tabs
on all crime throughout the city.

392
00:27:14,981 --> 00:27:17,693
Which brings me
to why l called you here today.

393
00:27:17,775 --> 00:27:23,241
Let me introduce to you
my new robot policeman!

394
00:27:23,283 --> 00:27:25,870
Would anyone care for some tea or coffee?

395
00:27:26,829 --> 00:27:29,999
Oh! He's so lifelike.

396
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:31,210
- Ow!
- No, no.

397
00:27:31,251 --> 00:27:35,005
Dibble's the only thing in this station
that isn't computerised.

398
00:27:35,047 --> 00:27:37,717
You can tell because he makes mistakes.
Watch.

399
00:27:41,138 --> 00:27:43,850
This is my robot!

400
00:27:47,228 --> 00:27:48,439
Gaargh!

401
00:27:54,362 --> 00:27:59,410
l have a company willing to build
thousands and thousands ofthese machines.

402
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:02,873
All l need is thousands and thousands
of dollars.

403
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:05,292
Which, again, is where you come in.

404
00:28:05,334 --> 00:28:06,878
l don't know.

405
00:28:06,961 --> 00:28:10,715
You think these hi-tech gizmos
will really work?

406
00:28:10,757 --> 00:28:16,181
Of course! You can trick a policeman,
but you can't trick technology.

407
00:28:22,103 --> 00:28:23,648
All set!

408
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:32,408
♪ Alo Hawaii, Alo Hawaii

409
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,287

410
00:28:39,459 --> 00:28:41,168

00:28:46,048 --> 00:28:47,344

413
00:29:06,365 --> 00:29:09,829
That's what l'm talking about.
That's what l'm talking about.

414
00:29:10,245 --> 00:29:12,165
Welcome home, boys.

415
00:29:12,206 --> 00:29:14,000
You did it again, TC!

416
00:29:15,334 --> 00:29:18,381
Top Cat, Top Cat, Top Cat!

417
00:29:18,921 --> 00:29:20,924
Top Cat, Top Cat!

418
00:29:22,009 --> 00:29:24,387
Pay the talent, too, will ya, Brain?

419
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,265
But we're out of bananas, TC.

420
00:29:31,062 --> 00:29:34,190
We gotta feed him something, so er...

421
00:30:22,456 --> 00:30:24,461
l suffer. l suffer. l suffer.

422
00:30:30,592 --> 00:30:32,594
CHOO-CHOO: Whoa-oh!

423
00:30:33,218 --> 00:30:34,723
Hi, guys!

424
00:30:34,806 --> 00:30:36,808
Oh! Choo-Choo.

425
00:30:40,897 --> 00:30:43,232
Well, if it isn't Fancy Fancy.

426
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:46,111
You won't escape from me this time.

427
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:48,907
lt's not a good time for this right now.

428
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:50,950
l'll call you tomorrow, OK, Donna?

429
00:30:51,492 --> 00:30:53,035
Who's Donna?

430
00:30:53,076 --> 00:30:55,706
Er...Diana♪ Daisy♪ Dee Dee?

431
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,294
You come back here, Fancy Fancy!

432
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,467
Whoagh!

433
00:31:11,516 --> 00:31:13,476
You won't regret this, Mr Mayor.

434
00:31:13,518 --> 00:31:16,856
You can make the cheque out
to Lou Strickland.

435
00:31:17,565 --> 00:31:19,025
No need to fill in the amount.

436
00:31:39,049 --> 00:31:41,345
That's my house!

437
00:31:41,386 --> 00:31:45,182
- One dollar to see the gorilla!
- Top Cat! Oh!

438
00:31:47,393 --> 00:31:50,523
Looks like Top Cat found a way
around your technology.

439
00:31:50,564 --> 00:31:52,232
No, wait!

440
00:31:52,273 --> 00:31:53,399
Wait!

441
00:31:53,482 --> 00:31:55,696
Let me know when your technology
is capable

442
00:31:55,737 --> 00:31:59,323
of catching criminals like Top Cat.

443
00:31:59,364 --> 00:32:01,368
You'll have your money then.

444
00:32:01,867 --> 00:32:04,204
No, don't leave. Mr Mayor, please!

445
00:32:04,245 --> 00:32:06,125
Wait, come back with my money!

446
00:32:06,167 --> 00:32:07,375
Arrgh!

447
00:32:07,416 --> 00:32:09,377
This is terrible, sir.

448
00:32:09,417 --> 00:32:14,133
Our dream of making New York City
a better and safer place is gone.

449
00:32:15,636 --> 00:32:17,263
Calm down, Trixie.

450
00:32:17,303 --> 00:32:21,309
l'll just show the Mayor
what my technology can do.

451
00:32:22,644 --> 00:32:25,354
l happen to know this...Top Cat guy.

452
00:32:25,395 --> 00:32:27,400
ls there anything l can do?

453
00:32:28,274 --> 00:32:32,031
Of course. Of course there is.

454
00:32:36,953 --> 00:32:41,167
l gotta admit, your asking me out
so suddenly was quite a surprise.

455
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:43,210
How'd you even find me?

456
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:46,298
l looked up Handsome
in the phone book

457
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,259
and then l called them up
and asked for your address.

458
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,426
Ha, ha, ha.

459
00:32:50,467 --> 00:32:52,472
l never did like that guy!

460
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:56,226
l'm sorry l was in such a rush
when we first met.

461
00:32:56,853 --> 00:32:58,854
Tonight is my treat.

462
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,526
Waiter, l'll have five orders of lobster.

463
00:33:02,568 --> 00:33:05,153
l think l'll order the small salad.

464
00:33:05,195 --> 00:33:09,574
That's so considerate that you're ordering
food to bring back to your gang.

465
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,830
That's a great idea!
Make that 25 orders of lobster!

466
00:33:14,705 --> 00:33:17,753
Now, where were we?

467
00:33:17,793 --> 00:33:20,588
Well...l was telling you about myself.

468
00:33:20,629 --> 00:33:24,218
l lived in an orphanage, grew up,
went to college, studied hard,

469
00:33:24,258 --> 00:33:26,262
got a job to pay for college...

470
00:33:26,303 --> 00:33:29,099
And now,
l have a very prestigious career.

471
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:30,433
Well, you know,

472
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,895
all work and no play is no way to live.

473
00:33:32,936 --> 00:33:34,689
lt beats living in an alley.

474
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:39,528
The alley's not so bad, especially if
you've someone special to share it with.

475
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,572
You and the other riff-raff?

476
00:33:42,615 --> 00:33:44,576
You got me all wrong.

477
00:33:44,617 --> 00:33:47,998
We only steal from those slimy
self-important rich people

478
00:33:48,038 --> 00:33:50,041
to give the money to ourselves...

479
00:33:51,542 --> 00:33:52,795
..and orphans.

480
00:33:52,837 --> 00:33:56,298
Did l ever tell you
how much l love orphans?

481
00:34:08,021 --> 00:34:10,440
Excuse me,
l really have to take this call.

482
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:11,983
Hurry back.

483
00:34:12,024 --> 00:34:15,362
l might get back faster
if l leave my purse just laying here.

484
00:34:15,403 --> 00:34:19,201
lt's so heavy with revealing stuff
about me that it would slow me down.

485
00:34:19,242 --> 00:34:24,248
You know what they say. You can tell a lot
about a woman from her purse.

486
00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:25,999
Oh, sure.

487
00:34:40,852 --> 00:34:42,561
Whoagh!

488
00:34:47,441 --> 00:34:50,112
You were right,
he couldn't resist snooping!

489
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:53,117
Perfect!

490
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,206
Got it!

491
00:34:58,248 --> 00:35:00,334
Great work, Trixie.

492
00:35:00,376 --> 00:35:03,713
And great work to you, beautiful.

493
00:35:03,755 --> 00:35:06,757
- Hm?
- Nothing! Get back here right now!

494
00:35:10,554 --> 00:35:13,057
l'm sorry, but l have to run.

495
00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:15,143
lt was really nice to see you tonight.

496
00:35:16,353 --> 00:35:19,358
What a shame.
We were just getting to know each other.

497
00:35:20,607 --> 00:35:21,984
Ohh!

498
00:35:33,873 --> 00:35:36,878
Boys, you're never gonna believe
the night l had.

499
00:35:36,918 --> 00:35:38,796
l am in love!

500
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:42,843
And to celebrate, l got gourmet
Iobster dinners for all of you!

501
00:35:42,884 --> 00:35:44,804
How could you, TC?

502
00:35:44,846 --> 00:35:48,349
Well, if l'd known you felt that way,
l would've brought back steak.

503
00:35:50,435 --> 00:35:51,979
Fish?

504
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,606
Pork chops?

505
00:35:53,647 --> 00:35:56,652
My, my, you are a bunch of picky eaters.

506
00:35:56,692 --> 00:36:00,699
We're not angry about that, TC,
we're angry about this!

507
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,830
"Terrible Top Cat Robs City Orphanage."
What?

508
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:11,920
l'll grant you the cat in the picture is
very good-looking, but it ain't me.

509
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:17,552
Well, if you didn't steal the money,
how did you get all those lobster dinners?

510
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:23,850
You told me we only robbed people
that deserved it, that we live by a code.

511
00:36:23,891 --> 00:36:26,353
Boys, boys, calm down a minute.

512
00:36:26,394 --> 00:36:27,939
l'm innocent.

513
00:36:36,241 --> 00:36:38,242
Arrest that cat!

514
00:36:38,493 --> 00:36:42,748
Strickland, l know we've had our
differences, but l am innocent.

515
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,793
l'd like to believe that, TC.

516
00:36:44,834 --> 00:36:46,629
Honestly, l would.

517
00:36:46,669 --> 00:36:51,385
But l have security camera footage of you
that says otherwise.

518
00:36:54,469 --> 00:36:55,807
Ha, ha, ha!

519
00:36:55,848 --> 00:37:01,605
There's nothing l like better
than stealing mom orphans.

520
00:37:01,647 --> 00:37:06,569
lt's a great excuse to get away
mom my gang, too.

521
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:09,738
Talk about a pack of losers!

522
00:37:10,071 --> 00:37:15,872
Also, Strickland is the most
handsome man l've ever seen!

523
00:37:16,456 --> 00:37:18,834
While l appreciate the compliment,
Top Cat,

524
00:37:18,876 --> 00:37:21,755
it doesn't change the fact
that you're a criminal.

525
00:37:21,796 --> 00:37:23,422
And the worst part is,

526
00:37:23,464 --> 00:37:29,304
you weren't even gonna share the money
you stole with your own gang.

527
00:37:30,306 --> 00:37:32,851
- Huh?
- Is that true, TC?

528
00:37:32,893 --> 00:37:36,564
Of course l wasn't gonna share the money,
cos l didn't take it!

529
00:37:36,981 --> 00:37:39,691
Where's Dibble♪ He knows
l wouldn't do something like this.

530
00:37:39,733 --> 00:37:42,779
- Dibble's a clown.
- Certainly, he can be foolish.

531
00:37:42,821 --> 00:37:46,201
No, l mean l've literally turned him
into a clown.

532
00:37:49,744 --> 00:37:51,958
Agh! You killed it!

533
00:37:52,915 --> 00:37:55,418
- Come with me.
- Wait! l'm innocent.

534
00:37:55,459 --> 00:37:58,172
l can prove it!
There's this girl, Trixie...

535
00:38:01,677 --> 00:38:05,139
Trixie! You're here!
Tell them l was with you.

536
00:38:07,727 --> 00:38:08,977
Trixie?

537
00:38:11,605 --> 00:38:13,482
You work for Strickland?

538
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:16,402
l'm sorry, TC, this...

539
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:20,282
this is just what's best for the city.

540
00:38:20,324 --> 00:38:21,785
This was a set-up!

541
00:38:21,826 --> 00:38:23,787
Get in the cat carrier.

542
00:38:23,829 --> 00:38:25,830
Boys, you got to help me!

543
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:45,979
l hereby condemn you to life in prison!

544
00:38:47,942 --> 00:38:49,944
Next up, Top Cat.

545
00:38:52,238 --> 00:38:54,240
Let's see what we have here.

546
00:38:54,323 --> 00:38:56,325
Yep, yep, mm-hm.

547
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,995
Yep, mm-hm.

548
00:38:58,036 --> 00:38:59,705
This doesn't make any sense.

549
00:38:59,746 --> 00:39:01,206
No, no, no!

550
00:39:01,247 --> 00:39:05,003
You obviously didn't commit this crime.

551
00:39:05,212 --> 00:39:06,922
My thoughts exactly.

552
00:39:06,963 --> 00:39:09,884
Right. l mean, you're not on trial here.

553
00:39:09,925 --> 00:39:15,849
Well, you are, but you deserve
to be treated innocent till proven guilty.

554
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:18,937
And you deserve a fair
and impartial trial.

555
00:39:18,978 --> 00:39:20,981
Couldn't agree more.

556
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,776
Bailiff, let's bring in the jury.

557
00:39:29,783 --> 00:39:32,996
But, sir, this isn't a fair
and impartial jury.

558
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,039
l want to talk to my lawyer.

559
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,582
Present!

560
00:39:36,622 --> 00:39:38,586
l promise to do my best, Top Cat.

561
00:39:38,628 --> 00:39:40,629
Are you kidding me?

562
00:39:40,671 --> 00:39:45,552
Before becoming chief of police,
Strickland was the best lawyer in town.

563
00:39:45,593 --> 00:39:50,933
- And don't forget handsome, Your Honour.
- But l don't want him to represent me.

564
00:39:50,975 --> 00:39:54,146
Noted: the accused renounces his defence.

565
00:39:54,396 --> 00:39:55,438
Jurors?

566
00:39:56,898 --> 00:40:01,279
Have you reached a verdict
in the case of sweet adorable orphans

567
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,325
versus Top Cat
who is obviously guilty?

568
00:40:04,366 --> 00:40:06,744
A verdict♪ But what about a trial?

569
00:40:06,826 --> 00:40:08,287
lt doesn't matter!

570
00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:12,751
We all saw the video of you earlier.
What's to say♪ You obviously did it.

571
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:18,718
We, the jurors,
find Top Cat guilty of all charges.

572
00:40:18,759 --> 00:40:23,055
Farewell.
l hereby sentence you to cat jail.

573
00:40:26,518 --> 00:40:29,314
Oh, no, looks like l can't send you there.

574
00:40:29,354 --> 00:40:30,856
lt's all filled up.

575
00:40:30,897 --> 00:40:32,650
Ha, ha, ha... Yes!

576
00:40:32,692 --> 00:40:38,949
So...l'll have to send you
to dog jail instead!

577
00:40:39,534 --> 00:40:41,118
But l'm innocent!

578
00:40:45,416 --> 00:40:50,840
Mr Mayor, l trust that now you can see
how technology can keep our city safe.

579
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:54,510
Here's your money, Strickland.
Use it wisely.

580
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:56,513
Oh, don't worry.

581
00:40:57,929 --> 00:40:59,850
l will.

582
00:41:22,419 --> 00:41:26,091
One side, make way!
Top Cat walking!

583
00:41:46,489 --> 00:41:48,241
Here comes my new chew toy.

584
00:41:48,283 --> 00:41:49,409
Uh-oh.

585
00:41:49,451 --> 00:41:52,998
You can say goodbye to a couple of
those nine lives, Top Cat.

586
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:55,376
Hey, my old pal, Griswald.

587
00:41:55,416 --> 00:41:59,546
- What'd they get you for?
- Overdue library book.

588
00:41:59,587 --> 00:42:01,549
Oh, that doesn't sound so bad.

589
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:04,969
The book was called
How To Eat Cats In Prison!

590
00:42:10,769 --> 00:42:12,020
You're dead!

591
00:42:15,648 --> 00:42:18,236
Hey, buddy,
your girlfriend's here to see you.

592
00:42:18,276 --> 00:42:20,906
She's got a tail, collar and says "bark".

593
00:42:20,947 --> 00:42:23,784
Woo-hoo! That's my girlfriend!

594
00:42:23,826 --> 00:42:25,619
l've been waiting 20 years to see her.

595
00:42:25,659 --> 00:42:26,955
Thanks a lot, buddy!

596
00:42:26,997 --> 00:42:28,832
l'm coming!

597
00:42:38,844 --> 00:42:44,100
l know we all feel very sad, but
with TC in jail, we'll need a new leader.

598
00:42:44,391 --> 00:42:49,314
l think the only way is for everyone
to think of a number from one to five.

599
00:42:49,356 --> 00:42:50,482
Benny?

600
00:42:50,524 --> 00:42:52,486
- Two.
- Spook?

601
00:42:52,527 --> 00:42:55,363
- Like, one?
- Fancy Fancy?

602
00:42:55,404 --> 00:42:57,408
- Three.
- Brain?

603
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,160
Brain?

604
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:01,497
Brain!

605
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:04,333
l'm thinking. l'm thinking.

606
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,460
Hmm...

607
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,673
Too late. You're all wrong!

608
00:43:10,756 --> 00:43:11,884
lt's four.

609
00:43:11,926 --> 00:43:15,387
But you said it had to be a number
from one to five.

610
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:18,393
Forget it, Brain. Don't worry, guys.

611
00:43:18,433 --> 00:43:23,399
We'll just do what TC used to
and everything will be all right!

612
00:43:31,364 --> 00:43:32,909
Whoagh!

613
00:43:35,203 --> 00:43:36,747
Wait for me!

614
00:44:05,238 --> 00:44:06,866
♪ Top Cat!

615
00:44:24,805 --> 00:44:27,808
Attention, citi_ens of New York.

616
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:31,687
lt was my brilliant technology
that allowed me to catch

617
00:44:31,728 --> 00:44:34,609
a vicious criminal like Top Cat.

618
00:44:37,026 --> 00:44:42,074
And l will continue to use that technology
to make your lives safer

619
00:44:42,116 --> 00:44:46,122
by putting security cameras
on every street corner!

620
00:44:50,377 --> 00:44:52,212
ln every home!

621
00:44:54,926 --> 00:44:59,931
And in every bedroom,
broom closet, and bathroom.

622
00:45:00,889 --> 00:45:03,017
There is nowhere that any of you

623
00:45:03,058 --> 00:45:05,521
will ever be able to hide

624
00:45:05,562 --> 00:45:06,521
e_er!

625
00:45:06,605 --> 00:45:12,152
There's also a new cu_ew
that started a ham hour ago!

626
00:45:12,194 --> 00:45:14,281
So get in your houses, now!

627
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:51,159
l guess that's that.

628
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,415
Oh, how l love you when
you're an evil dictator!

629
00:45:55,456 --> 00:45:59,711
- Sir, what have you done?
- Eliminated crime completely.

630
00:45:59,753 --> 00:46:03,673
No-one can do anything wrong
ifthey're watched 24/7.

631
00:46:03,714 --> 00:46:05,259
24/7?

632
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,762
- Isn't that a bit...
- Inspired?

633
00:46:07,802 --> 00:46:10,349
lt is! It's the only way to stop crime.

634
00:46:10,389 --> 00:46:12,268
So, people are a little scared.

635
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:13,935
They'll get used to the new way.

636
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:31,083
Going somewhere?

637
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:33,668
l just thought l'd do
some light gardening,

638
00:46:33,709 --> 00:46:37,088
try to pretty up the joint,
you know how it is.

639
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:43,305
Your gardening is gonna have to wait, cos
youse and mes got scores to settles, cat!

640
00:46:47,101 --> 00:46:50,354
Cat♪ Who are you calling a cat?

641
00:46:50,437 --> 00:46:52,566
l'm calling youse a cat!

642
00:46:52,607 --> 00:46:54,735
Well, you are clearly mistaken.

643
00:46:54,775 --> 00:46:56,363
l'm not a cat.

644
00:46:56,403 --> 00:46:58,406
l'm in dog jail, aren't l?

645
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,203
GRISWALD: Huh?

646
00:47:02,245 --> 00:47:03,455
l guess.

647
00:47:04,161 --> 00:47:07,042
Well, how can l be a cat
if l'm in dog jail?

648
00:47:07,084 --> 00:47:09,585
But how come you look different from me?

649
00:47:09,627 --> 00:47:12,299
l didn't want to mention
this in front ofthe other fellas.

650
00:47:12,381 --> 00:47:14,800
But if l'm a dog,
and l think we just agreed that l am,

651
00:47:14,842 --> 00:47:17,471
and you look different
from me, which you do...

652
00:47:17,595 --> 00:47:21,310
l'm afraid that makes you...a cat!

653
00:47:21,392 --> 00:47:24,021
No! It can't be!

654
00:47:24,062 --> 00:47:27,234
All the tail chasing, the hydrant peeing
and the biting mailmen...

655
00:47:27,275 --> 00:47:29,110
it was all a lie?

656
00:47:29,151 --> 00:47:31,070
lt's the only thing that makes sense.

657
00:47:31,821 --> 00:47:33,448
You know?

658
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:38,079
l think maybe l always suspected it
on some level.

659
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:43,127
Ohh, my poor wife, when she finds out!

660
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:47,675
You can't tell anyone!

661
00:47:48,008 --> 00:47:51,680
Griz, my pal, l wouldn't dream of letting
your little secret out.

662
00:47:51,722 --> 00:47:55,850
Of course, l might need a few favours
from you in return.

663
00:47:56,059 --> 00:47:58,146
- Ohh!
- This should get you started.

664
00:48:08,698 --> 00:48:12,079
Have you checked out the new
A1 5 robot vacuum on cell block C?

665
00:48:12,204 --> 00:48:15,457
Yeah. She's got all the attachments.

666
00:48:23,425 --> 00:48:25,427
Look at the lid on that!

667
00:48:25,468 --> 00:48:28,599
That's one _ne-looking garbage can.

668
00:48:31,936 --> 00:48:33,938
BENNY: TC!

669
00:48:34,313 --> 00:48:36,900
Oh, Top Cat, where are you?

670
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:38,694
Benny?

671
00:48:38,736 --> 00:48:41,321
CHOO-CHOO:
Forget about him, Benny.

672
00:48:41,363 --> 00:48:43,909
FANCY FANCY:
The nogood tNo face lied to us.

673
00:48:44,283 --> 00:48:46,953
He even stole mom dolphins.

674
00:48:47,037 --> 00:48:49,040
Maybe they were orphans.

675
00:48:50,291 --> 00:48:55,548
The sooner we all, like, forget about
Top Cat, you know, like, the better. OK?

676
00:48:55,588 --> 00:48:56,798
l guess you're right.

677
00:48:57,591 --> 00:49:01,053
lt's time to forget about TC and move on.

678
00:49:12,315 --> 00:49:13,945
OK, let's see here...

679
00:49:13,986 --> 00:49:19,327
"To spy on your citizens,
simply access the display of your cameras

680
00:49:19,369 --> 00:49:22,538
by pressing the Spy button, Figure C."

681
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:24,583
Now, that's easy.

682
00:49:27,753 --> 00:49:31,382
You! Do you have
an eating-bananas-in-public permit?

683
00:49:31,424 --> 00:49:34,345
Too bad! 1 OO-dollar fine!

684
00:49:34,385 --> 00:49:35,804
Throw it out now!

685
00:49:36,513 --> 00:49:40,018
There's another 50 for trash can rental.

686
00:49:40,058 --> 00:49:42,603
And 20 for trash can deposit fees.

687
00:49:42,644 --> 00:49:44,190
Pay the officer.

688
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:48,695
You there! Hat-wearing fee!

689
00:49:48,737 --> 00:49:50,155
20 dollars!

690
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:52,824
Carrying a concealed hat?

691
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:58,539
1,OOO-dollar fee and three days
in the slammer!

692
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:03,963
You there!
No parking at any time.

693
00:50:04,004 --> 00:50:06,466
But there isn't any sign.

694
00:50:07,215 --> 00:50:10,180
There. There's your sign.

695
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:16,353
Money, money, money.

696
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:25,948
Ha ha!

697
00:50:25,988 --> 00:50:29,995
lsn't it wonderful, Trixie?
No-one can stop me!

698
00:50:30,035 --> 00:50:36,126
And the best part is, l can use all the
money to make myself even more handsome.

699
00:50:36,168 --> 00:50:39,632
Look, l've already got my teeth whitened!
Ha, ha, ha!

700
00:50:39,673 --> 00:50:42,092
But the people are so terrified!

701
00:50:42,133 --> 00:50:44,386
How could you do this, Strickland?

702
00:50:44,428 --> 00:50:45,932
Oh, it was easy...

703
00:50:47,348 --> 00:50:49,225
..with the help ofthis little book here.

704
00:50:49,266 --> 00:50:51,937
This is an outrage.
What about all this money?

705
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:55,234
Don't worry, Trixie,
you'll get your share soon enough.

706
00:50:55,275 --> 00:50:57,277
That's not what l want.

707
00:50:57,318 --> 00:51:02,074
You were supposed to make this city safer,
but instead, no-one is safe from you!

708
00:51:02,491 --> 00:51:05,913
Maybe it's time you asked yourself
which side you're on.

709
00:51:05,954 --> 00:51:10,877
Yeah. Maybe.
Consider this my resignation...sir!

710
00:51:11,877 --> 00:51:16,050
You know what♪ You're fired, Trixie!
Do you hear me?

711
00:51:16,091 --> 00:51:17,761
Fired!

712
00:51:18,592 --> 00:51:21,474
There's not one honest person
in this place!

713
00:51:27,105 --> 00:51:28,232
Ooh.

714
00:51:37,407 --> 00:51:40,328
Hey! How did we end up broke?

715
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:45,459
l think we forgot how to make money,
but remembered how to spend it.

716
00:51:45,501 --> 00:51:48,339
l guess the good news is,
things can't get any worse.

717
00:51:50,633 --> 00:51:53,971
OK, now things definitely can't get any...

718
00:51:54,011 --> 00:51:56,015
Oww-eee!

719
00:51:57,309 --> 00:52:00,395
At least lightning never strikes
the same place twice.

720
00:52:00,436 --> 00:52:01,981
Aaaargh!

721
00:52:03,232 --> 00:52:04,566
Come on!

722
00:52:04,607 --> 00:52:07,571
l can't believe TC would abandon us
like this.

723
00:52:07,611 --> 00:52:09,864
He knows we can't take care of ourselves.

724
00:52:09,905 --> 00:52:16,038
l'm sure that, like... TC is doing
as bad as we're doing, probably worse!

725
00:52:22,213 --> 00:52:23,589
What is that?

726
00:52:27,637 --> 00:52:29,638
All right, move on.

727
00:52:36,813 --> 00:52:41,695
- Can we get some better chow here?
- Hey, you gonna finish that?

728
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:53,542
Hey! Have you ever seen Griswald do that?

729
00:52:53,583 --> 00:52:56,379
- Nope.
- And the new guy looks weird.

730
00:52:57,798 --> 00:53:02,220
Well, if he's got Griswald to serve him,
man, he must be a tough dog.

731
00:53:02,261 --> 00:53:04,222
Mm-hm!

732
00:53:05,596 --> 00:53:08,643
Yeuch! What the heck was that?

733
00:53:08,684 --> 00:53:10,146
lt's slops, sir.

734
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,232
All the dogs eat it.

735
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:15,443
l've made better meals out oftrash
l found in the alley.

736
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:19,573
Just because we're dogs doesn't mean
they should treat us like dogs!

737
00:53:19,614 --> 00:53:20,699
Yeah!

738
00:53:20,741 --> 00:53:22,745
We're not dogs! Ooops.

739
00:53:29,794 --> 00:53:32,255
TC: A little bit of pepper,
some oregano...

740
00:53:43,937 --> 00:53:46,313
Yippee! Finally some good grub!

741
00:53:46,438 --> 00:53:48,442
Whoo-hoo!

742
00:53:48,484 --> 00:53:49,735
Yeah!

743
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,324
l'll have what he's having.

744
00:53:54,699 --> 00:53:57,954
Top Dog, Top Dog, Top Dog!

745
00:54:05,754 --> 00:54:08,675
Top Cat, Top Cat, Top Cat!

746
00:54:13,388 --> 00:54:15,390
Let me down, boys.

747
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:19,647
l need some time alone.

748
00:54:24,986 --> 00:54:26,987
What got into him?

749
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:30,868
Beats me!

750
00:54:33,245 --> 00:54:36,041
Also...l'm not a cat.

751
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:51,852
You ain't going to believe me, Gerry.
Strickland made me clean his toilet again.

752
00:54:51,892 --> 00:54:53,686
Gerry?

753
00:54:56,398 --> 00:54:57,566
l'm coming.

754
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,445
You?

755
00:54:59,486 --> 00:55:01,905
Let me in, there's something
you need to see.

756
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:10,667
Top Cat Secret File?

757
00:55:17,923 --> 00:55:19,927
That robot robbed the orphanage!

758
00:55:20,051 --> 00:55:22,888
- That means...
- Top Cat is innocent!

759
00:55:23,389 --> 00:55:26,602
STRICKLAND: You! re wrong, Trixie.
Top Cat is guilty...

760
00:55:27,726 --> 00:55:30,106
..of standing in my way.

761
00:55:30,564 --> 00:55:34,152
But, the old police chief,
your father-in-law...

762
00:55:34,192 --> 00:55:35,863
he believed in you!

763
00:55:35,905 --> 00:55:37,905
Father-in-law♪ Hah!

764
00:55:37,947 --> 00:55:41,536
He doesn't even have a daughter,
that's how good a con man l am.

765
00:55:42,411 --> 00:55:44,080
l'll go to the police with this!

766
00:55:44,121 --> 00:55:46,876
You forget, Dibble. l am the police.

767
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:49,378
And you're not going an_here.

768
00:55:50,423 --> 00:55:52,424
Guards! Sei_e him!

769
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:56,554
Doo_ay ridiculously small.

770
00:55:57,221 --> 00:55:59,224
Movement impossible.

771
00:56:00,894 --> 00:56:02,895
We've been framed.

772
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,900
Resistance is futile, Dibble!

773
00:56:11,614 --> 00:56:13,282
Nowhere to run, Dibble!

774
00:56:13,323 --> 00:56:15,328
l've got you!

775
00:56:16,662 --> 00:56:18,663
You'll never escape me!

776
00:56:19,748 --> 00:56:21,752
Wait! That's the ladies' room.

777
00:56:21,794 --> 00:56:23,670
Should we knock_rst?

778
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:25,715
Occupied!

779
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:28,800
Hurry, Omicer Dibble!

780
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:34,349
Fools! Bring down that door
and arrest those traitors!

781
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:42,359
Run, Dibble, run! Tell Top Cat l'm sorry!

782
00:56:44,527 --> 00:56:46,365
Strickland is gonna kill us.

783
00:56:46,407 --> 00:56:49,325
lt's OK, we'll just say
a giant bird got him.

784
00:56:49,367 --> 00:56:52,498
Yeah, yeah, that's good.
l read something about one of those.

785
00:56:52,538 --> 00:56:53,873
When did you learn to read?

786
00:57:01,298 --> 00:57:03,302
l wonder what Top Cat is doing.

787
00:57:03,342 --> 00:57:05,721
- l bet l know who'd know.
- Who?

788
00:57:05,761 --> 00:57:06,973
Top Cat.

789
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:10,017
He always knew what everyone was up to.

790
00:57:10,558 --> 00:57:11,812
Any food left?

791
00:57:12,645 --> 00:57:15,398
No, that was always TC's job,

792
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:20,321
along with scheduling, planning, bossing,
and keeping the lizards away!

793
00:57:21,657 --> 00:57:24,118
Shoo, shoo! Get off! Agh!

794
00:57:24,159 --> 00:57:25,535
Get off!

795
00:57:30,666 --> 00:57:32,546
Omicer Dibble! What are you doing here?

796
00:57:32,586 --> 00:57:34,547
lt's not "officer" any more.

797
00:57:34,588 --> 00:57:38,510
These days it's actually
Valet-Manservant-Helper-Monkey Dibble...

798
00:57:38,551 --> 00:57:40,470
Must be nice.

799
00:57:40,512 --> 00:57:42,558
l'm here because Top Cat is innocent.

800
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:44,601
He didn't rob the orphans at all.

801
00:57:45,769 --> 00:57:49,440
You mean, like, he didn't break the code
or hold out on us?

802
00:57:49,773 --> 00:57:51,775
Nope. He was framed.

803
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:53,571
lt's all right here!

804
00:57:54,738 --> 00:57:57,408
That thing framed my friend Top Cat?

805
00:57:58,951 --> 00:58:00,911
Noo-oo!

806
00:58:00,953 --> 00:58:02,957
l got, l got it!

807
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:07,755
That was really awesome, dude!

808
00:58:07,797 --> 00:58:09,798
That's the way to do it.

809
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:17,014
That was the only evidence l had.

810
00:58:17,264 --> 00:58:19,100
Now we'll never get him out ofjail.

811
00:58:19,142 --> 00:58:20,978
Ha, yes, we will.

812
00:58:21,018 --> 00:58:23,023
We'll, like, break him out.

813
00:58:23,606 --> 00:58:26,776
l, like, used to play pool
with a fellow named Gus,

814
00:58:26,816 --> 00:58:30,698
who busted out ofjail, like,
more times than l can count.

815
00:58:31,031 --> 00:58:32,951
He can count pretty high, too.

816
00:58:32,992 --> 00:58:35,913
Gus even broke out of dog jail once!

817
00:58:35,955 --> 00:58:39,209
He was sent there for, like,
peeing on a fire hydrant.

818
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:42,003
He sounds gross. And perfect!

819
00:58:42,045 --> 00:58:47,677
Yeah! The only problem is,
he, like, lives way out in the Boonies.

820
00:58:47,969 --> 00:58:50,598
- Can we take your police cruiser?
- No good.

821
00:58:50,638 --> 00:58:53,434
Strickland has them all
on a GPS tracking device.

822
00:58:53,476 --> 00:58:55,061
He'll catch us in no time.

823
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:57,104
l think l have the answer.

824
00:59:03,572 --> 00:59:06,658
Hey! There's that eclipse
they mentioned on the news!

825
00:59:07,032 --> 00:59:09,037
CHOO-CHOO: Wow! It's so dark!

826
00:59:10,996 --> 00:59:15,961
SPOOK: How long is it going to last?
BENNY: Should be just a few more seconds.

827
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:19,675
There. It's over.

828
00:59:19,717 --> 00:59:21,593
Now this is what l was talking about.

829
00:59:30,894 --> 00:59:32,063
Ah!

830
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:55,092
Not to be ungrateful but...
does this thing go any faster?

831
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:57,261
Second gear coming up!

832
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:02,516
Yippee, yeah!

833
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:05,188
Ring the bell! Make him stop!

834
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:08,356
He loves getting his picture taken!

835
01:00:08,397 --> 01:00:10,235
lt's the only way to make him...

836
01:00:16,699 --> 01:00:18,411
..stop.

837
01:00:20,706 --> 01:00:22,708
Former Policeman! Open up!

838
01:00:24,458 --> 01:00:26,463
Just a minute.

839
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:43,273
Well, well, well.

840
01:00:43,314 --> 01:00:46,278
lt looks like Big Gus and his gang
are all here.

841
01:00:46,986 --> 01:00:48,989
- Small Louie.
- Evening.

842
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:53,620
Then there's Skinny Moe, Fatty Stan...

843
01:00:54,454 --> 01:00:56,291
..and of course, One-Eyed Bill.

844
01:00:56,332 --> 01:01:00,462
Why do you call him One-Eyed Bill
when he has all that other stuff going on?

845
01:01:00,503 --> 01:01:01,589
What?

846
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:05,343
You think we give him a new nickname
every time he has an accident?

847
01:01:06,928 --> 01:01:13,018
What can me and my "law-abiding citizen"
pals do for youse guys?

848
01:01:13,142 --> 01:01:16,690
Our pal Top Cat has been sent to jail
for a crime he didn't commit.

849
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:19,192
We need you to help us get him out.

850
01:01:19,232 --> 01:01:22,155
Why should l help Top Cat?

851
01:01:22,196 --> 01:01:23,781
Because you owe him.

852
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:28,371
Stick 'em up!

853
01:01:28,412 --> 01:01:31,292
l said, stick 'em up!

854
01:01:35,502 --> 01:01:39,800
Thanks, Gus. No doubt about it,
you're the best tailor in the biz.

855
01:01:44,888 --> 01:01:49,896
- Sorry, TC, l don't have change now.
- Ah, you can owe me.

856
01:01:52,232 --> 01:01:54,277
Hey, Gus, we're gonna go rob the bank.

857
01:01:54,317 --> 01:01:56,028
Wanna come?

858
01:01:56,070 --> 01:01:59,283
Well, sure beats being a tailor.

859
01:02:00,074 --> 01:02:02,036
l guess l do owe TC.

860
01:02:02,077 --> 01:02:04,038
All right, l'll help youse guys.

861
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:07,585
But first things first...dinner!

862
01:02:14,718 --> 01:02:16,428
Waagh!

863
01:02:19,264 --> 01:02:23,103
You know, maybe we should call him
Window Bill.

864
01:02:23,145 --> 01:02:25,605
He does seem to fall through them a lot.

865
01:02:32,615 --> 01:02:34,617
Why are we going backwards?

866
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:38,704
Because, l've only broken out ofjail.

867
01:02:38,746 --> 01:02:41,918
This is the only way l know
how to get back in.

868
01:02:41,959 --> 01:02:45,588
Boy, even l think that's a stupid reason.

869
01:02:48,134 --> 01:02:50,052
Gentlemen, before we go further,

870
01:02:50,093 --> 01:02:55,016
l must warn you the sight that awaits you
on the other side may be hard to take.

871
01:02:55,516 --> 01:02:58,772
This ain't kindergarten,
this is a violent, scary place,

872
01:02:58,812 --> 01:03:01,858
filled with beings of pure evil.

873
01:03:06,612 --> 01:03:07,740
Huh?

874
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:18,545
Cheer up, TC. You transformed
this place into a paradise.

875
01:03:18,587 --> 01:03:20,589
Yeah, well...

876
01:03:20,631 --> 01:03:22,507
TC, it's us!

877
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:27,931
Oh.

878
01:03:27,973 --> 01:03:31,101
You. What are you doing here?

879
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:33,146
We're here to, like, rescue you!

880
01:03:33,729 --> 01:03:35,732
And l'm here to give you this.

881
01:03:36,523 --> 01:03:38,486
One dollar and 49 cents.

882
01:03:39,153 --> 01:03:42,532
l don't owe you anything any more.
Best of luck, fellas!

883
01:03:44,825 --> 01:03:48,038
Quick, TC,
Iet's go before the guards catch us.

884
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:53,963
And why should l go with you♪ You think
l'm nothing but a common criminal.

885
01:03:54,004 --> 01:03:56,589
- No offence.
- None taken, Top Dog!

886
01:03:56,631 --> 01:03:59,636
But we know the truth now,
that Strickland set you up.

887
01:04:00,386 --> 01:04:06,144
l seem to remember someone else
saying that exact thing a long time ago.

888
01:04:06,893 --> 01:04:10,357
- It was you, TC!
- That it was, Brain.

889
01:04:10,397 --> 01:04:14,904
Why would l ever want to leave this place?
l've everything l could ever ask for.

890
01:04:14,945 --> 01:04:22,829
Meet my new best pals: Vinny, Einstein,
Dandy Dandy, Spectrum and Chattanooga.

891
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:24,875
Hi, there.

892
01:04:25,251 --> 01:04:27,044
Hey, what up, dog?

893
01:04:27,084 --> 01:04:30,756
Whoa, dude, like,
this is a little awkward.

894
01:04:30,797 --> 01:04:34,178
Le pleasure is moi.

895
01:04:34,595 --> 01:04:37,181
But you don't have us.

896
01:04:38,014 --> 01:04:41,395
Please, TC, you gotta come back.

897
01:04:41,437 --> 01:04:43,772
We can't function without you.

898
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:45,567
More important than that...

899
01:04:45,609 --> 01:04:47,609
we miss you.

900
01:04:47,651 --> 01:04:50,197
We're sorry we ever doubted you.

901
01:04:50,239 --> 01:04:52,199
lt'll never happen again.

902
01:04:57,703 --> 01:05:00,668
Aw, l missed you, too.

903
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:04,088
Not even all this fancy stuff
could cheer me up.

904
01:05:04,672 --> 01:05:08,135
Actually, those candies kind oftook
the edge off. You really gotta try one.

905
01:05:12,306 --> 01:05:17,104
Maybe a little less chewing
and a little more getting out of here?

906
01:05:17,144 --> 01:05:18,939
Oh, no, look!

907
01:05:22,234 --> 01:05:25,865
How are we supposed to, like, leave now?

908
01:05:25,906 --> 01:05:27,909
We'll go out the front door.

909
01:05:31,288 --> 01:05:34,166
Rupert, my good man.
Did you hear the great news?

910
01:05:34,206 --> 01:05:36,503
l served my full sentence.

911
01:05:36,545 --> 01:05:38,545
What are you talking about, TC?

912
01:05:38,586 --> 01:05:41,008
You just got here.

913
01:05:41,049 --> 01:05:44,303
lndeed l did.
But you heard about how l'm a dog, right?

914
01:05:44,344 --> 01:05:48,351
Yup. l had a hunch the whole time, too.
l really did.

915
01:05:48,391 --> 01:05:52,772
Well, then, according to my calculations,
if a day is equal to seven dog days

916
01:05:52,814 --> 01:05:54,815
and l'm a dog...

917
01:05:54,857 --> 01:05:57,653
Add this and this times
the square root of four,

918
01:05:57,693 --> 01:06:00,991
minus the boiling point oftungsten,
carry the three and...

919
01:06:01,033 --> 01:06:03,034
That means l get out ofjail today!

920
01:06:04,285 --> 01:06:05,955
How about that?

921
01:06:05,996 --> 01:06:08,332
- This way.
- See ya, dogs!

922
01:06:08,374 --> 01:06:11,796
Sure was nice of you to show us cats
such hospitality.

923
01:06:12,088 --> 01:06:17,010
And for taking care of
our numero uno cat pal, TC.

924
01:06:19,345 --> 01:06:24,559
You're telling me...l was serving a cat?

925
01:06:25,351 --> 01:06:27,106
Get 'em!

926
01:06:28,857 --> 01:06:30,150
Aagh!

927
01:06:34,361 --> 01:06:37,577
lfthose dogs find out l'm a cat,
l'll be dead meat!

928
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:47,380
Stop running away, tubby!

929
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:50,424
Who are you calling tubby, tubby?

930
01:06:50,464 --> 01:06:51,844
You really think l'm tubby?

931
01:06:51,885 --> 01:06:54,846
Orange makes me look chubby.

932
01:07:06,987 --> 01:07:10,907
Hey, like, nice tie! Is that silk?

933
01:07:10,949 --> 01:07:13,661
Mine's, like, prison-issue denim.

934
01:07:14,286 --> 01:07:17,625
What are you doing cavorting
with the enemy♪ This is a riot!

935
01:07:18,458 --> 01:07:20,251
Stop copycatting me!

936
01:07:20,293 --> 01:07:21,629
Oh-hh-hh!

937
01:07:42,321 --> 01:07:43,947
What the...

938
01:07:56,003 --> 01:07:58,132
CHOO-CHOO: Hey, guys, come here!

939
01:08:08,853 --> 01:08:10,313
Looks like this is it, boys.

940
01:08:10,937 --> 01:08:15,986
My one regret is l won't be able to pull
off any more cons with my old gang.

941
01:08:16,025 --> 01:08:18,614
l'll never woo another lady.

942
01:08:18,655 --> 01:08:20,993
l'll never be chief of police!

943
01:08:21,034 --> 01:08:24,997
l'll never live long enough
to see this sunburn wear off.

944
01:08:25,747 --> 01:08:30,337
And l'll never know ifthis secret
exit door to the sewer ever opens.

945
01:08:39,806 --> 01:08:40,974
Ha ha!

946
01:08:41,015 --> 01:08:43,478
Well, l guess that's that.

947
01:08:43,519 --> 01:08:46,856
Gentlemen, let's get ready.
This gang is moving to Detroit.

948
01:08:46,898 --> 01:08:48,859
Detroit♪ What do you mean?

949
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:52,738
We got to recue Trixie.
She's been held prisoner by Strickland.

950
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:54,575
Well, serves her good.

951
01:08:54,616 --> 01:08:55,784
No, TC.

952
01:08:55,826 --> 01:08:58,496
I
If it weren't for her
we never could have rescued you.

953
01:08:58,537 --> 01:09:00,999
She's the one
who told me you were innocent.

954
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:05,587
l think you owe Trixie now.

955
01:09:15,099 --> 01:09:18,644
- Let's go, fellas!
- Wait, look!

956
01:09:21,606 --> 01:09:23,358
We'll never sneak past all ofthem.

957
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,403
Violation in progress!

958
01:09:25,445 --> 01:09:29,951
You are guilty of breaking
Handsome Strickland's cu_ew.

959
01:09:29,992 --> 01:09:31,201
And loitering.

960
01:09:31,243 --> 01:09:34,581
Extend hands so you may be apprehended.

961
01:09:35,790 --> 01:09:37,542
Hold on a second.

962
01:09:37,583 --> 01:09:40,130
How come you're not arresting yourselves?

963
01:09:40,171 --> 01:09:43,967
Does not compute. Please elaborate.

964
01:09:44,007 --> 01:09:45,969
He is a little slow.

965
01:09:46,011 --> 01:09:48,180
But l, too, am notfollowing.

966
01:09:48,472 --> 01:09:50,809
You're loitering and out past curfew too!

967
01:09:51,601 --> 01:09:54,522
Wow. It is past cu_ew.

968
01:09:54,563 --> 01:09:56,273
We could be in trouble.

969
01:09:56,315 --> 01:09:57,983
No, we uphold the law.

970
01:09:58,024 --> 01:10:00,029
But we're breaking the law.

971
01:10:00,071 --> 01:10:02,863
ALL ROBOTS: We uphold the law.
But we break the law.

972
01:10:02,904 --> 01:10:04,993
We uphold...breaking, breaking...

973
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:14,880
We've got a change of plans.

974
01:10:23,596 --> 01:10:27,102
How dare you interrupt my daily mud bath!

975
01:10:27,143 --> 01:10:28,103
Huh?

976
01:10:29,188 --> 01:10:30,983
We captured Officer Dibble.

977
01:10:31,023 --> 01:10:32,358
DIBBLE: Let me go!

978
01:10:35,027 --> 01:10:36,698
Let me go!

979
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:48,211
l bet your first office doesn't look
so cramped now, does it, Dibble?

980
01:10:53,176 --> 01:10:54,509
Agh!

981
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:58,014
Mr Mayor♪ Mrs Rich Lady?

982
01:10:58,055 --> 01:11:00,058
Oh, no, Gerry!

983
01:11:00,098 --> 01:11:02,103
Not you, too?

984
01:11:02,769 --> 01:11:04,646
Candy bar?

985
01:11:04,688 --> 01:11:07,109
1 OO dollars!

986
01:11:07,524 --> 01:11:10,738
- Is there anyone even left in the city?
- Nope.

987
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:15,076
And let me tell you, Dibble,
it makes policing so-oo much easier!

988
01:11:15,117 --> 01:11:19,373
Soon every city in this country
will look like this.

989
01:11:19,789 --> 01:11:23,503
Like l said, technology solves everything!

990
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:27,467
Now, if you'll excuse me,
my mud is drying.

991
01:11:28,551 --> 01:11:34,099
Why don't you tell me more
about how much you like technology, sir?

992
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:35,559
Don't mind if l do.

993
01:11:35,601 --> 01:11:40,899
l like technology better than rainbows,
better than ice cream, better than...

994
01:11:41,608 --> 01:11:43,361
..rainbow ice cream.

995
01:11:47,407 --> 01:11:48,533
Now what?

996
01:11:50,451 --> 01:11:52,456
Top Cat♪ You're free!

997
01:11:53,121 --> 01:11:56,627
Thanks to your help, l've been told.
Now let's get you out of here.

998
01:11:57,127 --> 01:12:01,382
Oh, Top Cat, what l did was inexcusable.

999
01:12:01,422 --> 01:12:02,593
Well, we'll talk later.

1000
01:12:02,634 --> 01:12:06,012
Dibble is keeping Strickland distracted,
but it won't last long.

1001
01:12:06,053 --> 01:12:11,602
l like technology better than this mole l
have on my butt that's shaped like a cow.

1002
01:12:11,643 --> 01:12:13,147
Let me show you.

1003
01:12:13,189 --> 01:12:14,523
Hurry up!

1004
01:12:14,565 --> 01:12:18,445
lf only l can figure out
how this thing opens. Any ideas?

1005
01:12:18,487 --> 01:12:20,488
Ah, the user manual!

1006
01:12:20,530 --> 01:12:24,536
lt holds the keycodes
for all of Strickland's systems.

1007
01:12:24,577 --> 01:12:28,165
Unfortunately, he keeps it inside a vault
in the Command Center

1008
01:12:28,665 --> 01:12:30,959
and getting it would be impossible.

1009
01:12:31,834 --> 01:12:34,464
l don't know the meaning
ofthe word impossible.

1010
01:12:34,505 --> 01:12:36,507
Me neither.

1011
01:12:37,468 --> 01:12:39,136
Sure, Brain.

1012
01:12:39,178 --> 01:12:40,638
Let's go, fellas.

1013
01:12:47,856 --> 01:12:51,525
The user's manual is in that
Command Center and we've got to go in!

1014
01:12:51,566 --> 01:12:53,655
Like, those fellas look pretty tough.

1015
01:12:53,695 --> 01:12:56,406
How are we, like, gonna get past them?

1016
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:59,203
lt's too bad they ain't lady robots.

1017
01:12:59,244 --> 01:13:02,580
l could charm the pants off all them
while you guys snuck past.

1018
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:07,837
DIBBLE: Oh, boys?
- What is that?

1019
01:13:07,878 --> 01:13:10,757
Over here. Hello.

1020
01:13:12,341 --> 01:13:13,678
Hi!

1021
01:13:17,098 --> 01:13:20,394
Hello, what is your serial number?

1022
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:23,023
l saw herfirst!

1023
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:34,745
Everybody stay close!

1024
01:13:41,252 --> 01:13:44,048
But how are we gonna open the door?

1025
01:13:44,090 --> 01:13:48,260
lf only we had something really thick,
we could bring down that door.

1026
01:13:53,099 --> 01:13:55,104
Oh, oh, ooh!

1027
01:13:56,311 --> 01:13:58,064
Keep up the good work, boys.

1028
01:13:58,105 --> 01:14:01,318
- And hurry it up, will ya?
- Hey, baby! Where are you going?

1029
01:14:04,488 --> 01:14:05,907
Oh, yeah!

1030
01:14:07,657 --> 01:14:08,787
Ha, ha!

1031
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:14,502
Another door?
You have got to be kidding me!

1032

01:14:24,137 --> 01:14:26,140
who is the handsomest of them all?

1035
01:14:28,307 --> 01:14:31,104
The password is Strickland.

1036
01:14:31,146 --> 01:14:32,439
Access granted.

1037
01:14:38,154 --> 01:14:41,158
l have an "l love technology" tattoo.
Let me show you.

1038
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:43,452
lntruders in the Command Center's hall.

1039
01:14:45,997 --> 01:14:48,249
What♪ l thought everybody was locked up.

1040
01:14:49,001 --> 01:14:51,212
Never mind, l'll see to this myself.

1041
01:14:54,841 --> 01:14:56,635
Hey, TC, l found it!

1042
01:14:56,676 --> 01:14:59,890
Great job, Benny.
Now, how do we open up the cells?

1043
01:14:59,931 --> 01:15:02,767
Wait, this thing is written in Portuguese.

1044
01:15:02,808 --> 01:15:04,018
Huh?

1045
01:15:07,230 --> 01:15:08,565
Hold it!

1046
01:15:08,607 --> 01:15:10,444
l found the English section.

1047
01:15:10,486 --> 01:15:15,241
"Congratulations and thank you for
choosing Evil Villain Command Center."

1048
01:15:18,745 --> 01:15:21,374
"Please do not expose
to extreme temperatures

1049
01:15:21,415 --> 01:15:24,584
and keep Command Center
always away from the reach of children."

1050
01:15:24,625 --> 01:15:27,004
Give me that! There's an index here.

1051
01:15:27,045 --> 01:15:29,007
Well, look up unlocking the cells.

1052
01:15:29,048 --> 01:15:33,262
Let's see: "Raiding citizens,
self-destruction, setting date and time."

1053
01:15:33,303 --> 01:15:35,724
What was that last one?

1054
01:15:35,766 --> 01:15:37,184
Setting date and time?

1055
01:15:37,225 --> 01:15:40,855
No, the self-destruction.
Look up that one.

1056
01:15:40,897 --> 01:15:42,649
Wait, what was that?

1057
01:15:45,068 --> 01:15:47,072
Hey, TC, l found it!

1058
01:15:48,862 --> 01:15:51,451
You just think you're a genius,
don't you, TC?

1059
01:15:51,493 --> 01:15:53,036
Huh!

1060
01:15:53,077 --> 01:15:55,038
You think you can beat me, Top Cat?

1061
01:15:55,079 --> 01:15:59,793
Nobody beats me.
l have technology on my side.

1062
01:16:00,043 --> 01:16:02,047
TC: Yeah, l got that.

1063
01:16:02,923 --> 01:16:06,053
And what do you have -
some outdated tricks and schemes?

1064
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:07,887
Your charm?

1065
01:16:07,929 --> 01:16:09,472
Not enough!

1066
01:16:09,513 --> 01:16:13,853
lt's a new era, Top Cat,
and there's no room for you in it.

1067
01:16:14,686 --> 01:16:20,152
Robots, report to the vault immediately,
to annihilate Top Cat and his gang.

1068
01:16:33,293 --> 01:16:36,839
Say, Strickland, did you build
these robots yourself?

1069
01:16:37,298 --> 01:16:42,638
Are you crazy♪ l won't risk ruining
my perfect hands with manual labour.

1070
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:45,640
l hired some jerk in Peekajoo
to do the job.

1071
01:16:45,682 --> 01:16:47,769
l thought that logo looked familiar.

1072
01:16:47,811 --> 01:16:49,813
l know the Maharaja.

1073
01:16:49,854 --> 01:16:56,111
Last time l saw him, he gave me this
doohickey - the Maharajaton 5000.

1074
01:16:56,402 --> 01:16:59,658
Wow! l'm so-oo impressed!

1075
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:05,998
lt's a phone, an MP3 player, hairdryer
and it also just so happens to...

1076
01:17:06,039 --> 01:17:09,002
..control your robots!

1077
01:17:19,974 --> 01:17:21,977
Police Bot, stop doing that!

1078
01:17:22,602 --> 01:17:27,942
Police Bot, you stop doing that
this instant or l swear... Yagh!

1079
01:17:27,983 --> 01:17:30,528
Looks like l have control ofthe city
now, Strickland.

1080
01:17:30,570 --> 01:17:35,618
l demand you free the citizens from jail
and tell the people l'm innocent!

1081
01:17:35,659 --> 01:17:36,994
Never!

1082
01:17:37,035 --> 01:17:39,832
Well, you leave me no choice.

1083
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:42,042
Robot, arrest Strickland.

1084
01:17:45,546 --> 01:17:47,591
Arrest him. Arrest him.

1085
01:17:47,632 --> 01:17:50,010
Arrest him. Arrest him.

1086
01:17:50,052 --> 01:17:52,054
Looks like they're coming for you!

1087
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:54,724
You think you're so clever.

1088
01:17:54,765 --> 01:17:59,064
What you fail to realise is that l have
the system self-destruct button.

1089
01:18:04,111 --> 01:18:06,321
What are you doing after work?

1090
01:18:09,409 --> 01:18:10,409
Huh?

1091
01:18:11,244 --> 01:18:16,625
Here it is: "Push the self-destruction
button located on the control panel."

1092
01:18:20,255 --> 01:18:22,674
You know,
you really didn't have to do that.

1093
01:18:24,092 --> 01:18:26,096
But l destroyed the robots!

1094
01:18:26,970 --> 01:18:31,060
Like l said, the Maharajaton 5000
does a lot ofthings,

1095
01:18:31,102 --> 01:18:33,062
but it can't control your robots.

1096
01:18:33,103 --> 01:18:35,106
l mean, come on!

1097
01:18:36,108 --> 01:18:37,734
But then how...

1098
01:18:37,774 --> 01:18:40,404
Oh, that♪ That's just Fancy Fancy.

1099
01:18:41,406 --> 01:18:42,698
Hi, there!

1100
01:18:42,738 --> 01:18:47,078
Mr Strickland, in the name of all
that is honest and law-abiding,

1101
01:18:47,119 --> 01:18:48,957
you're under arrest.

1102
01:18:48,998 --> 01:18:52,126
Oh, please! l'm too pretty to go to jail!

1103
01:18:52,167 --> 01:18:53,586
No! Stop!

1104
01:18:53,628 --> 01:18:56,549
Stop! Stop!

1105
01:18:56,716 --> 01:18:58,259
Don't worry, Strickland.

1106
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:00,888
l hear there's no more room
in the human jail.

1107
01:19:02,055 --> 01:19:03,557
Whew!

1108
01:19:03,639 --> 01:19:04,976
Agh!

1109
01:19:32,509 --> 01:19:37,056
Whoo-hoo! Baby, l've been waiting
for you to visit, it's been so long!

1110
01:19:37,096 --> 01:19:40,311
- No, no! Go away! Go away!
- Come here!

1111
01:19:47,484 --> 01:19:52,783
Without further ado, l'd like to thank
the hero who acted quickly

1112
01:19:52,824 --> 01:19:55,913
to turn the tables on a corrupt chief.

1113
01:19:55,953 --> 01:19:58,873
l present the new police chief...

1114
01:19:58,914 --> 01:20:00,918
..Chief Dibble!

1115
01:20:14,308 --> 01:20:17,396
This is the happiest moment of my life!

1116
01:20:18,231 --> 01:20:22,068
l'm gonna miss Omicer Dibble
now that he has a fancy new promotion.

1117
01:20:23,404 --> 01:20:25,991
Yeah, l'm gonna miss him, too.

1118
01:20:32,162 --> 01:20:34,374
Oh, l'll miss you too, guys.

1119
01:20:35,041 --> 01:20:36,336
Omicer Dibble!

1120
01:20:36,377 --> 01:20:38,797
Don't think you'll get rid of me so easily.

1121
01:20:38,838 --> 01:20:41,885
l plan to keep a close eye
on Hoagie's Alley.

1122
01:20:45,095 --> 01:20:49,935
We'll be more than delighted if you do so,
more than delighted.

1123
01:20:53,648 --> 01:20:57,778
Say, Trixie, now that l think of it,
l believe l owe you a lobster dinner.

1124
01:20:58,278 --> 01:21:05,119
Now that l think of it...
you owe me 25 lobster dinners, silly!

1125
01:21:07,623 --> 01:21:09,042
Ooh!

1126
01:21:09,584 --> 01:21:11,462
l'll be waiting for your call.

1127
01:21:12,796 --> 01:21:16,259
Did l hear someone say dinner?
l'm starving!

1128
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:22,893
l know just the thing to cheer you up -
my famous fish head, bottle cap, boot stew!

1129
01:21:22,935 --> 01:21:25,353
Yippee! It's about time.

1130
01:21:25,393 --> 01:21:27,064
l'm hungry.

1131
01:21:29,024 --> 01:21:31,694
You guys got room for one more cat
in that alley?

1132
01:21:31,735 --> 01:21:33,737
Sure we do, pal.

1133
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:36,617
There's always room for one more cat
in the gang.

1134
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:39,745
And you, my friend, are a darn good cat...

1135
01:21:39,787 --> 01:21:41,163
for a dog, that is.

1136
01:21:41,707 --> 01:21:43,708
A one, a two...

1137
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:45,960
