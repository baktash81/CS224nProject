1
00:02:38,163 --> 00:02:39,915
He's clean.

2
00:02:42,164 --> 00:02:42,914
So...

3
00:02:43,004 --> 00:02:45,518
Why are you here? Hm?

4
00:04:32,503 --> 00:04:34,255
<i>There was a time.</i>

5
00:04:47,946 --> 00:04:49,220
4:35.

6
00:04:50,346 --> 00:04:52,303
You misunderstood.

7
00:04:52,387 --> 00:04:56,221
I wasn't asking for the time,
I was just saying, "There was a time."

8
00:04:58,308 --> 00:05:00,060
There was a time?

9
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:01,707
Mm-hm.

10
00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:04,064
Take brown sugar back there, for example.

11
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,179
<i>She's pretty fucking foxy, right?</i>

12
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,030
She's 70.

13
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,067
If she's a day.

14
00:05:12,151 --> 00:05:13,630
But there was a time.

15
00:05:15,031 --> 00:05:18,068
- I don't follow.
- The name's Smith. I'm from out of town.

16
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:20,108
- Listen, Mr. Smith...
- Just Smith.

17
00:05:21,632 --> 00:05:24,511
The reason I'm in town,
in case you're wondering...

18
00:05:26,073 --> 00:05:28,348
...is because of a Kansas City Shuffle.

19
00:05:29,194 --> 00:05:30,946
What's a Kansas City Shuffle?

20
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:36,426
Kansas City Shuffle is
when everybody looks right and you go left.

21
00:05:36,515 --> 00:05:38,471
- Never heard of it.
- Hm.

22
00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:40,626
It's not something people hear about.

23
00:05:41,636 --> 00:05:43,388
Falls on deaf ears mostly.

24
00:05:44,117 --> 00:05:47,348
But this particular one's
been over 20 years in the making.

25
00:05:47,437 --> 00:05:48,870
<i>20 years, huh?</i>

26
00:05:48,957 --> 00:05:50,913
No small matter.

27
00:05:53,678 --> 00:05:55,635
Requires a lot of planning.

28
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,715
It involves a lot of people.

29
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,392
People connected only
by the slightest of events.

30
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:05,396
Like whispers in the night...

31
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,114
...in that place that never forgets
even when those people do.

32
00:06:16,402 --> 00:06:18,597
It all starts with a horse.

33
00:06:22,684 --> 00:06:25,721
<i>It's what they called back then
a drugstore handicap.</i>

34
00:06:26,764 --> 00:06:30,724
<i>A guy wants what the fella calls a sure thing,
so he schemes to make it so.</i>

35
00:06:31,645 --> 00:06:36,594
<i>He calls in the doc, a nobbler from Antwerp
known for his savvy but not for his discretion.</i>

36
00:06:38,926 --> 00:06:41,077
<i>WOMA N: Oh, fuck me, baby, fuck me, baby.</i>

37
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:44,239
<i>The same could be said
for Doc's jelly on the side - Gloria.</i>

38
00:06:44,327 --> 00:06:46,796
- Almost there, almost there.
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

39
00:06:46,888 --> 00:06:49,243
Hey, which horse did you say
it was again, baby?

40
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:02,169
<i>Which brings us to Abe, because Gloria
was too much jelly for one outfit.</i>

41
00:07:03,211 --> 00:07:05,167
Hey, baby, is your wife around?

42
00:07:05,251 --> 00:07:07,402
<i>- What do you want?
WOMA N: Who is it, Abe?</i>

43
00:07:08,131 --> 00:07:10,088
<i>Ah... it's Seymour.</i>

44
00:07:10,172 --> 00:07:14,245
<i>GLORIA: Sure, tell that bitch to open her eyes,
maybe then she'd see more.</i>

45
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,289
Seymour says hello.

46
00:07:16,373 --> 00:07:18,841
What are you doing calling me here?

47
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:22,370
Christmas came early this year, baby.
I got a present for you.

48
00:07:22,454 --> 00:07:24,047
Remember my friend Doc?

49
00:07:24,134 --> 00:07:27,605
<i>SMITH: Now Abe wasn't a nosy fella,
but he had a nose.</i>

50
00:07:28,495 --> 00:07:30,611
<i>And right below his nose was his mouth.</i>

51
00:07:31,455 --> 00:07:33,606
<i>ABE: Do you remember Gloria the hooker?</i>

52
00:07:33,696 --> 00:07:38,373
Well, Gloria's got this friend Doc
who's got a line on a doped-up racehorse.

53
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:40,414
<i>The fix is in at Aqueduct.</i>

54
00:07:40,497 --> 00:07:42,728
- Seventh horse. Tenth race.
- Doped up?

55
00:07:42,818 --> 00:07:45,491
<i>SMITH:
And then there was this joker who had ears...</i>

56
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:47,857
<i>ABE: Let's get back.</i>

57
00:07:47,938 --> 00:07:50,169
<i>SMITH: ... who looked like somebody's uncle.</i>

58
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:52,216
Max, who's your favorite uncle?

59
00:07:52,299 --> 00:07:54,450
OK, who's your second favorite uncle?

60
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,293
Just pay attention.

61
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,133
I got something here.

62
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,850
<i>SMITH: And before you know it,
folks are getting a big dose of the gimmies,</i>

63
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:04,375
<i>and men start talking their hats off.</i>

64
00:08:04,462 --> 00:08:09,013
<i>And that Manischewitz Grapevine Wine spills in
your ear and tells you, you got a sure thing,</i>

65
00:08:09,102 --> 00:08:11,536
<i>and what's worse is, you start to believe it.</i>

66
00:08:12,263 --> 00:08:14,414
<i>At least that's how it went with old Max,</i>

67
00:08:14,504 --> 00:08:16,574
<i>who wasn't so much old, as he was tired.</i>

68
00:08:17,424 --> 00:08:19,380
<i>Tired of being a dog without a day.</i>

69
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:22,741
<i>Tired of waking up and finding
that his dreams were only dreams.</i>

70
00:08:22,825 --> 00:08:24,053
We're leaving.

71
00:08:24,145 --> 00:08:27,661
<i>But mostly,
Max was tired of not having a front lawn.</i>

72
00:08:27,746 --> 00:08:29,623
Make sure he doesn't come home late.

73
00:08:29,706 --> 00:08:32,095
- I will.
- I was talking to your son.

74
00:08:32,187 --> 00:08:34,462
- (Giggles)
- You think that's funny, do you?

75
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,186
Uh-huh. Bye, Mom.

76
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:38,417
Yeah. Bye, Mom!

77
00:08:38,508 --> 00:08:39,702
Love you.

78
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:46,059
<i>TANNOY: They're off.</i>

79
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,069
All right, if your ma asks,
where were we today?

80
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,503
- Shea Stadium.
- To see?

81
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,469
- Mets v Phillies.
- Good man. Give me the post-game.

82
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:59,190
Stallard gave up six runs in the first five innings.

83
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:03,424
Ed Kranepool hit a line drive down right field
but it hit the wall, fouled by a foot.

84
00:09:03,513 --> 00:09:05,787
Gonder hit a groundball
between first and second

85
00:09:05,873 --> 00:09:09,024
but he's so slow, second baseman
Tony Taylor tagged him out at first.

86
00:09:10,313 --> 00:09:12,270
Did you get all that from the radio?

87
00:09:12,354 --> 00:09:13,503
Mm -hm.

88
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,186
You're good.

89
00:09:15,274 --> 00:09:17,106
OK, I'll be right back.

90
00:09:17,195 --> 00:09:19,470
No, no, no. You've got to stay in the car.

91
00:09:19,555 --> 00:09:21,114
Why?

92
00:09:21,195 --> 00:09:24,074
Because they don't let little boys inside the track.

93
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:26,752
Saul's dad takes him to the track.

94
00:09:26,836 --> 00:09:29,067
Well, Saul's dad is a degenerate gambler.

95
00:09:29,157 --> 00:09:32,433
And if you're the son of a degenerate gambler,
they let you in.

96
00:09:32,518 --> 00:09:34,474
It's economically viable.

97
00:09:34,558 --> 00:09:36,788
Are you going to be a degenerate gambler?

98
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,995
Hey. You know better than that.

99
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,913
Your old man's smart.
He only plays a sure thing.

100
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,512
Look.
This money's gonna get you through Harvard.

101
00:09:48,601 --> 00:09:50,353
And you're gonna be a doctor.

102
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,715
But until then...

103
00:09:51,801 --> 00:09:53,713
you've got to stay in the car.

104
00:09:56,042 --> 00:09:57,999
Hey.

105
00:09:58,082 --> 00:10:00,916
Next weekend, you and me go to a ballgame.

106
00:10:01,002 --> 00:10:02,755
- OK.
- OK.

107
00:10:02,843 --> 00:10:04,561
I love you, kid.

108
00:10:04,644 --> 00:10:06,236
I love you too, Dad.

109
00:10:06,923 --> 00:10:08,880
Wait, watch. Watch, watch, watch.

110
00:10:08,964 --> 00:10:10,921
I almost forgot. 15 minutes.

111
00:10:11,004 --> 00:10:12,961
Start counting.

112
00:10:16,965 --> 00:10:20,038
<i>TANNOY:
The next race at the Aqueduct is the tenth race.</i>

113
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:31,760
<i>- Come on, come on.
TANNOY: The field is making towards</i>

114
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:36,240
<i>the final turn, and Number Seven has moved
into fifth position on the outside.</i>

115
00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:38,685
<i>- Number Two has the lead...
- (Cheering)</i>

116
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:40,328
Come on.

117
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,207
<i>Number One is against the rail.</i>

118
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:47,045
<i>And Number Seven is beginning
to pick up the pace on the outside.</i>

119
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:48,200
Yes!

120
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:50,089
<i>Yes, come on, baby, come on!</i>

121
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:54,121
- Let's go!
- (Cheering intensifies)

122
00:10:54,213 --> 00:10:58,764
<i>... to challenge, goes clear
and Number Seven takes the lead!</i>

123
00:10:58,853 --> 00:11:00,765
<i>It's Number Seven who now has the lead.</i>

124
00:11:00,854 --> 00:11:02,970
<i>It's strolling clear.</i>

125
00:11:03,054 --> 00:11:03,964
Yes!

126
00:11:06,455 --> 00:11:07,092
Oh!

127
00:11:09,455 --> 00:11:11,411
<i>Number Seven has fallen!</i>

128
00:11:13,856 --> 00:11:16,246
<i>Number One comes home
and takes the lead to win it.</i>

129
00:11:16,337 --> 00:11:19,613
<i>SMITH: Max woke up to find his dreams
had just been the stuff of pipes.</i>

130
00:11:19,697 --> 00:11:21,654
- I want to place a bet.
- How much?

131
00:11:21,737 --> 00:11:22,966
20 large.

132
00:11:24,377 --> 00:11:26,334
Oh, you must feel real lucky.

133
00:11:27,378 --> 00:11:28,892
<i>I'll take your bet.</i>

134
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,731
And lay it off.

135
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:32,457
I've got a bookie's bookie.

136
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,252
I'll give you 2-1 on the horse.

137
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,900
Uh-uh. The racing form says 9-1.

138
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,854
So you go to a ticket vendor
with your 20 grand in hand,

139
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:44,740
and you get 9-1 if the spread sticks.

140
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:48,497
You come in here with your pockets turned out,
you get 2-1.

141
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,733
The juice is ten.

142
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:55,055
That means if you lose, you're all in for 22 grand.

143
00:11:55,143 --> 00:11:57,100
20 for the bet, two for the juice.

144
00:11:57,903 --> 00:12:01,693
Can you pay these monies? Huh? Can you?

145
00:12:02,745 --> 00:12:04,303
Yeah.

146
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:11,382
<i>Just to be clear,</i>

147
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:13,025
<i>if you lose...</i>

148
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,900
...you're gonna owe a lot of money
to the kind of men

149
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:21,903
you do not want to owe
the smallest amount of money to.

150
00:12:34,911 --> 00:12:36,468
Henry!

151
00:12:37,511 --> 00:12:38,660
Henry!

152
00:12:42,552 --> 00:12:43,905
Henry!

153
00:12:46,313 --> 00:12:47,871
Henry!

154
00:12:49,513 --> 00:12:51,470
Hey, buddy. You got a light?

155
00:12:51,553 --> 00:12:53,510
No. Henry!

156
00:12:53,594 --> 00:12:56,826
In that case, how about the 20 Gs
you just blew on the Seven horse?

157
00:12:56,914 --> 00:13:00,032
- What have you done with my son?
- He's on his way home. Just like you.

158
00:13:00,115 --> 00:13:01,071
Urgh!

159
00:13:09,477 --> 00:13:11,229
Where am I?

160
00:13:16,798 --> 00:13:20,428
Roth, he'll tell you everything, I swear.

161
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:25,956
He already has.

162
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:33,074
Please.

163
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:36,118
I have a family.

164
00:13:38,162 --> 00:13:39,993
<i>Please.</i>

165
00:13:40,082 --> 00:13:41,721
<i>Please!</i>

166
00:13:41,803 --> 00:13:43,475
<i>Where's my boy?</i>

167
00:13:45,683 --> 00:13:47,036
<i>Henry!</i>

168
00:13:51,404 --> 00:13:52,997
<i>Where are they?</i>

169
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,082
<i>Henry!</i>

170
00:14:00,366 --> 00:14:01,595
<i>Henry!</i>

171
00:14:16,729 --> 00:14:17,878
Fuck.

172
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:19,323
Shit.

173
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,843
Jesus.

174
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,841
"Fuck, shit, Jesus" is right.

175
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,880
I don't understand.
Why did they kill Max's family?

176
00:14:25,971 --> 00:14:27,723
New outfit in town.

177
00:14:28,531 --> 00:14:31,921
They didn't want somebody else
betting on a fixed horserace with them.

178
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:35,289
Trying to make an impression.

179
00:14:36,892 --> 00:14:38,849
That's a fucking story, man.

180
00:14:38,933 --> 00:14:43,291
Charlie Chaplin entered a Charlie Chaplin
look-a-like contest in Monte Carlo

181
00:14:43,373 --> 00:14:45,330
and came in third.

182
00:14:45,414 --> 00:14:47,371
Now that's a story.

183
00:14:49,495 --> 00:14:51,451
This...

184
00:14:51,535 --> 00:14:53,491
This is something else.

185
00:14:53,576 --> 00:14:55,532
So that's a Kansas City Shuffle?

186
00:14:55,616 --> 00:14:56,935
No.

187
00:14:57,017 --> 00:14:58,972
It's just the inciting incident.

188
00:15:00,017 --> 00:15:01,973
The catalyst.

189
00:15:03,017 --> 00:15:06,169
This - is a Kansas City Shuffle.

190
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:09,495
<i>They look right...</i>

191
00:15:09,578 --> 00:15:11,649
And you...

192
00:15:11,739 --> 00:15:13,695
go left.

193
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,537
Sorry about that, son.

194
00:15:23,581 --> 00:15:26,255
Sometimes there's more to life than just living.

195
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:30,658
Besides... you can't have a Kansas City Shuffle
without a body.

196
00:16:27,273 --> 00:16:29,229
<i>- He's down!
- Get the roof!</i>

197
00:16:29,313 --> 00:16:31,065
<i>Up there!</i>

198
00:17:23,723 --> 00:17:25,679
I'm coming!

199
00:17:27,804 --> 00:17:29,362
Coming.

200
00:17:33,124 --> 00:17:35,081
It took you long enough.

201
00:17:36,165 --> 00:17:37,598
You're not Nick.

202
00:17:37,686 --> 00:17:39,995
You're not as tall as I thought you'd be.

203
00:17:40,086 --> 00:17:42,043
Well, I'm short for my height.

204
00:17:43,727 --> 00:17:47,322
That makes sense because I can usually
tell how tall someone is by their knock.

205
00:17:47,407 --> 00:17:50,445
You have a deceptively tall knock.
Congratulations.

206
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,800
So it's a good thing?

207
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:56,920
I open the door expecting you to be up here,
you're down here.

208
00:17:57,008 --> 00:18:00,285
That combined with a low centre of gravity -
forget about it.

209
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,041
Who are you?

210
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,563
I'm Slevin.

211
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,642
And what happened to your nose?

212
00:18:06,571 --> 00:18:08,641
I was using it to break some guy's fist.

213
00:18:08,731 --> 00:18:10,687
Somebody hit you?

214
00:18:10,772 --> 00:18:12,842
Yeah... I was kind of expecting it, though.

215
00:18:12,931 --> 00:18:14,524
You were kind of expecting it?

216
00:18:14,612 --> 00:18:16,968
Well, they say bad things happen in threes.

217
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:21,485
<i>First... I lost my job.</i>

218
00:18:21,573 --> 00:18:24,771
<i>Then I came home to find
my apartment building had been condemned</i>

219
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:28,370
<i>due to a hybrid breed
of Ecuadorian Super Termites.</i>

220
00:18:28,454 --> 00:18:30,411
<i>So I went to my girlfriend Kelly's.</i>

221
00:18:31,455 --> 00:18:33,491
<i>I had a key so I let myself in.</i>

222
00:18:44,418 --> 00:18:46,692
- Hey, don't stop on my account.
- Oh shit!

223
00:18:49,018 --> 00:18:50,371
Slevin.

224
00:18:50,459 --> 00:18:52,289
It was an accident.

225
00:18:52,979 --> 00:18:54,811
What, like he tripped and you fell?

226
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,416
<i>MA N: Slevin, do you know what time it is?</i>

227
00:19:00,501 --> 00:19:03,334
I'm at the airport,
are you sure you want me to come out?

228
00:19:03,421 --> 00:19:06,653
<i>Yeah, two weeks in New York
and the only Kelly you'll remember</i>

229
00:19:06,741 --> 00:19:10,371
<i>is the Kelly who gave you your first hand job
on the bus to summer camp.</i>

230
00:19:10,462 --> 00:19:13,216
Kelly Perkins. Said her hands were dry
and she needed...

231
00:19:13,303 --> 00:19:16,852
<i>She said that to a lot of guys,
that's why we called her Jerkins Perkins.</i>

232
00:19:16,943 --> 00:19:19,504
<i>- Just call me when you land, all right?
- Yeah.</i>

233
00:19:28,305 --> 00:19:31,537
Yeah, I just got into town, Nick.
I'm on my way over to your place.

234
00:19:31,626 --> 00:19:33,583
Say, man, you got the time?

235
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,818
Ya, man, it's uh... 7:23.

236
00:19:36,907 --> 00:19:38,863
So you're probably still asleep?

237
00:19:38,948 --> 00:19:41,416
- Yo, you got a smoke?
- No, I don't smoke, man.

238
00:19:41,507 --> 00:19:45,787
<i>Why don't you just go ahead and give me
your wallet and I'll buy my own smokes?</i>

239
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:47,348
Am I being mugged?

240
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:50,224
Man!

241
00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:52,186
And so here I am.

242
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,466
You said three.

243
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,780
- What?
- You said bad things happen in threes.

244
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:01,580
You lost your job, your apartment was
condemned, Kelly was cheating on you

245
00:20:01,671 --> 00:20:03,423
<i>and you got mugged - that makes four.</i>

246
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:05,389
When you're on a roll, you're on a roll.

247
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:07,224
Interesting, although I would add,

248
00:20:07,312 --> 00:20:10,032
not the ever so clever hold-up man
one hears so much about.

249
00:20:10,113 --> 00:20:13,310
- Well, he did break my nose.
- But overlooked your suitcase.

250
00:20:13,393 --> 00:20:15,429
Maybe it wouldn't make for a speedy getaway.

251
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:18,506
True, but then there's the matter of your watch.
Pretty fancy.

252
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:20,426
- It's a fake.
- But he didn't know that.

253
00:20:20,514 --> 00:20:23,234
- Maybe he didn't see it.
- He saw it. He asked you for the time.

254
00:20:23,316 --> 00:20:25,272
You say this was your third mugging?

255
00:20:25,356 --> 00:20:26,914
Uh... I travel a lot.

256
00:20:26,995 --> 00:20:28,749
Where's Nick?

257
00:20:28,836 --> 00:20:31,909
I don't know. He was supposed to
meet me here. He never showed up.

258
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,874
<i>- How did you get in?
- Door was open.</i>

259
00:20:33,957 --> 00:20:36,028
- Door was open?
- Yeah.

260
00:20:36,118 --> 00:20:38,268
- Open or unlocked?
- I don't remember.

261
00:20:38,358 --> 00:20:41,317
- You said open.
- Could have been. What was your name again?

262
00:20:41,398 --> 00:20:43,355
Lindsey. I live across the hall.

263
00:20:43,439 --> 00:20:45,669
- Oh.
- I came over to borrow a cup of sugar.

264
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:48,068
<i>- Where's your cup?
- I came to borrow a cup of sugar.</i>

265
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,230
If I had a cup, I'd have come to borrow sugar.

266
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,958
- Touché.
- (Phone rings)

267
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,475
Maybe that's Nick. It's right there.

268
00:20:55,281 --> 00:20:56,237
Hello?

269
00:20:57,682 --> 00:20:59,035
Hello?

270
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:02,999
They hung up.

271
00:21:03,082 --> 00:21:06,314
I have an idea. Have you used the phone
since you've been here?

272
00:21:06,403 --> 00:21:08,360
No, except for that.

273
00:21:09,204 --> 00:21:10,762
Sorry, wrong number.

274
00:21:10,844 --> 00:21:12,562
That was the Hotel Cheval.

275
00:21:12,644 --> 00:21:14,441
What are you doing?

276
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:16,356
We know who he called. Who called him?

277
00:21:16,445 --> 00:21:18,675
- Columbo says three things...
- Columbo?

278
00:21:18,765 --> 00:21:21,917
Yeah, Columbo was this TV detective
played by Peter Falk...

279
00:21:22,006 --> 00:21:24,237
I know who Columbo is. Yeah.

280
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:26,237
He looked for three things at a crime scene.

281
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:29,637
What's there now that wasn't before.
What was there before that isn't now.

282
00:21:29,727 --> 00:21:31,958
- And what's been moved.
- Is this a crime scene?

283
00:21:32,048 --> 00:21:33,925
- I think Nick's in trouble.
- Ah.

284
00:21:34,008 --> 00:21:35,362
Sorry, wrong number.

285
00:21:35,448 --> 00:21:37,404
That was the Hotel Cheval again!

286
00:21:37,489 --> 00:21:41,198
So what? He called the hotel,
the hotel called him back. Makes sense.

287
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:42,643
So, maybe it's a clue.

288
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,960
- A clue to what?
- A clue to what happened to Nick.

289
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:49,248
<i>- We don't know anything did.
- We don't know anything didn't.</i>

290
00:21:49,331 --> 00:21:52,688
You're here, he's not. The door was open.
Bad things happen where you...

291
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:54,682
Shit. I've got to stop by work.

292
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:58,481
Just for a couple of hours. I'll come back,
then we can start the investigation.

293
00:21:59,493 --> 00:22:01,882
- The investigation?
- Uh-huh. It'll be fun.

294
00:22:01,973 --> 00:22:02,769
OK.

295
00:22:05,853 --> 00:22:07,810
I totally forgot...

296
00:22:09,455 --> 00:22:11,331
Yeah.

297
00:22:12,175 --> 00:22:13,131
Sorry.

298
00:22:13,215 --> 00:22:15,605
- May I borrow a cup of sugar?
- What?

299
00:22:16,456 --> 00:22:19,368
<i>I never gave it much thought
until I put up a fresh pot of coffee.</i>

300
00:22:19,456 --> 00:22:22,176
I was on my way to the store
and I thought Nick'd have sugar.

301
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,691
You tell me your story, I leave, sugarless.

302
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:26,848
I come back, you put your penis on exhibition.

303
00:22:26,938 --> 00:22:30,772
Although the coffee's probably gone bad
by now, I insist on following through.

304
00:22:30,858 --> 00:22:33,054
It's like a Norman Rockwell painting.

305
00:22:33,139 --> 00:22:34,288
What, my penis?

306
00:22:34,379 --> 00:22:36,813
No. No, the sugar.

307
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:39,414
<i>Neighbors borrowing sugar from one another.</i>

308
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,377
It's very um... Andy Griffith.

309
00:22:42,141 --> 00:22:43,175
Yeah.

310
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:46,059
<i>That's Andy Griffith.
The penis thing is not very Mayberry.</i>

311
00:22:46,141 --> 00:22:47,699
No.

312
00:22:47,782 --> 00:22:49,738
Thanks for the sugar... sugar.

313
00:22:58,624 --> 00:23:01,058
I wanted to try and catch the next show.

314
00:23:01,144 --> 00:23:02,657
I don't go on again till eight.

315
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:10,261
Whew!

316
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,143
It's not nearly eight o'clock yet.

317
00:23:20,908 --> 00:23:23,138
- The Boss wants to see you.
- Who...?

318
00:23:23,228 --> 00:23:25,059
- The Boss.
- Who's The Boss?

319
00:23:25,148 --> 00:23:27,264
- The guy we work for.
- Jesus!

320
00:23:28,029 --> 00:23:30,259
Come here and sit your punk ass down.

321
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,265
Go.

322
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:36,188
I'm not the guy you're looking for.
I don't live here.

323
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,226
Well, you look like the guy that lives here.

324
00:23:38,311 --> 00:23:40,666
Then you don't know what he looks like.

325
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:42,628
He means to say you look like you live here.

326
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,828
Yeah, that's what I mean to say.

327
00:23:44,912 --> 00:23:46,868
I look like I live here, but I don't.

328
00:23:46,952 --> 00:23:49,420
I'm just visiting, I just got in this morning.

329
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:52,744
The cat I'm looking for, his name is uh...

330
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:55,189
- His name is Nick, man.
- Nick.

331
00:23:55,274 --> 00:23:57,230
The cat's name is Nick. Now...

332
00:23:58,635 --> 00:24:00,352
Who are you?

333
00:24:00,435 --> 00:24:01,753
I'm Slevin.

334
00:24:03,355 --> 00:24:05,107
You got some ID?

335
00:24:08,235 --> 00:24:10,796
The funny thing about that is
I got mugged this morning.

336
00:24:10,877 --> 00:24:12,390
Look, look.

337
00:24:12,476 --> 00:24:14,229
Tell it to the One Legged Man.

338
00:24:14,317 --> 00:24:16,273
So he can bump it off down the road.

339
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:27,913
- Hey, listen, motherfucker...
- Yo, I got this.

340
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:30,389
- Slow, slow, slow, slow your roll, man.
- I got this.

341
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,631
Just let me. Just let me, all right?

342
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,598
Motherfucker!

343
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:37,514
All I know is,
The Boss slides me this here address,

344
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,558
and he says, "Sloe" - that's him.

345
00:24:39,641 --> 00:24:41,200
"Elvis" - that's me.

346
00:24:41,282 --> 00:24:43,797
"Bring me the cat
who resides at this here address."

347
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:45,395
Now he told me that today.

348
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,838
You just so happen to be here today.

349
00:24:47,923 --> 00:24:51,075
So I guess you the cat I'm supposed to pick up.

350
00:24:51,884 --> 00:24:52,839
Today.

351
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:54,482
But I'm not Nick.

352
00:24:54,565 --> 00:24:56,236
Yeah, well, unfortunately for you,

353
00:24:56,325 --> 00:24:59,442
you're not the first cat to tell me
you wasn't the guy I was looking for.

354
00:25:00,285 --> 00:25:03,198
You can ask Lindsey, she lives across the hall.
She lives here.

355
00:25:03,286 --> 00:25:05,482
Hold on, man, I ain't asking nobody nothing.

356
00:25:05,566 --> 00:25:07,956
Nick, Slevin, Clark Kent -
whatever your name is.

357
00:25:08,047 --> 00:25:10,880
The Virgin Mary could come waltzing up
with her fine ass,

358
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,640
titties hanging out and everything.

359
00:25:12,728 --> 00:25:17,325
If she told me your name was Jesus Christ, I
still gotta take you to see The Boss. Know why?

360
00:25:17,408 --> 00:25:18,398
No.

361
00:25:18,489 --> 00:25:20,445
Orders.

362
00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:22,760
Now, you do know what orders is, right?

363
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,045
<i>Orders is orders.</i>

364
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:30,602
So I guess no-one ever taught you not to use
the word you're defining in the definition?

365
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:39,047
Say something else, I will break
your motherfucking nose. I ain't playing.

366
00:25:39,812 --> 00:25:41,769
My nose is already broken.

367
00:25:48,294 --> 00:25:50,250
<i>- Can I just say one more thing?
- What?</i>

368
00:25:50,335 --> 00:25:52,802
Can you turn the heat up in here
cos it's really cold?

369
00:25:52,895 --> 00:25:55,409
Uh... yeah.

370
00:25:55,495 --> 00:25:59,455
Y-You... You should have thought about that
before you started in with all the lip.

371
00:26:28,261 --> 00:26:30,616
SLEVIN: Ah, Jeez. (Sighs)

372
00:26:41,984 --> 00:26:44,976
- It's cold out there.
- Let's hurry it up, man.

373
00:26:57,307 --> 00:26:59,263
Yo, grab his ass.

374
00:27:03,068 --> 00:27:05,024
<i>The boss is right up there, chump.</i>

375
00:27:25,512 --> 00:27:26,865
Well, listen.

376
00:27:26,951 --> 00:27:29,625
Your boys Elvis and Sloe
picked up the wrong guy.

377
00:27:30,792 --> 00:27:32,749
<i>- I'm not Nick Fisher.
- Mr. Fisher?</i>

378
00:27:34,473 --> 00:27:36,829
Are you familiar with The Shmoo, Mr. Fisher?

379
00:27:37,874 --> 00:27:39,830
A comic strip I liked as a boy.

380
00:27:40,554 --> 00:27:42,910
The Shmoo was a loveable creature, really.

381
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,747
<i>Laid eggs...</i>

382
00:27:45,516 --> 00:27:47,472
gave milk...

383
00:27:48,515 --> 00:27:51,588
...and died of sheer ecstasy
when looked at with hunger.

384
00:27:53,557 --> 00:27:55,513
The Shmoo loved to be eaten.

385
00:27:55,597 --> 00:27:57,747
It could taste like any food you desire.

386
00:27:58,758 --> 00:28:02,194
Shmoo hide, cut thin, made fine leather.

387
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:06,592
<i>Even Shmoo whiskers
made excellent toothpicks.</i>

388
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:11,196
In essence, the Shmoo supplied
all of the world's wants.

389
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:17,118
I only bring up the Shmoo because it's relevant
to you and why you were brought here.

390
00:28:17,201 --> 00:28:18,520
I'm sorry, who are you?

391
00:28:18,601 --> 00:28:20,080
I'm The Boss.

392
00:28:20,162 --> 00:28:21,879
I thought he was The Boss.

393
00:28:22,682 --> 00:28:23,637
Why?

394
00:28:24,482 --> 00:28:25,915
Do we look alike?

395
00:28:27,003 --> 00:28:31,042
So, Mr. Fisher...
you were gonna tell me something?

396
00:28:31,124 --> 00:28:33,080
I don't know, you brought me here.

397
00:28:33,164 --> 00:28:34,483
<i>Yes, I did.</i>

398
00:28:34,564 --> 00:28:36,520
Back when you thought I was him.

399
00:28:37,244 --> 00:28:39,600
I never thought you were him.
I thought he was you.

400
00:28:39,685 --> 00:28:42,644
I was trying to tell him, you...
that they picked up the wrong guy.

401
00:28:42,725 --> 00:28:45,115
- Wrong guy for what?
- What you wanted to see me about.

402
00:28:45,206 --> 00:28:47,197
- Know what I wanted to see you about?
- No.

403
00:28:47,286 --> 00:28:49,243
Then how do you know I have the wrong guy?

404
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:52,479
- Because I'm not...
- Maybe I wanted to give you $96,000.

405
00:28:52,568 --> 00:28:54,559
In that case, do I still have the wrong guy?

406
00:28:55,808 --> 00:28:57,844
Do you want to give me $96,000?

407
00:28:57,928 --> 00:29:00,887
<i>No, do you want to give me $96,000?</i>

408
00:29:00,969 --> 00:29:02,322
No, should I?

409
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:04,321
I don't know, should you?

410
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,526
I don't know, should I?

411
00:29:13,692 --> 00:29:15,284
Long story short.

412
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:20,132
- I think we're well past that point.
- I'll bet it was that mouth that got you that nose.

413
00:29:23,213 --> 00:29:27,889
OK, I'm under the impression that you're
under the impression that I owe you $96,000.

414
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:30,329
No, you owe Slim Hopkins $96,000.

415
00:29:32,294 --> 00:29:34,251
You owe Slim, Slim owes me.

416
00:29:35,095 --> 00:29:36,414
You owe me.

417
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,653
<i>Well, in that case, is Slim around?</i>

418
00:29:48,418 --> 00:29:51,376
Hey, Slim. Do you know this cat?

419
00:29:53,499 --> 00:29:54,454
Slim?

420
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:57,732
No use.

421
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:01,972
Ever since somebody shot him,
old Slim went deaf.

422
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,976
What happened to make Slim go deaf?

423
00:30:05,061 --> 00:30:06,288
Why?

424
00:30:08,061 --> 00:30:12,499
Because I owe you $96,000 and I might have
a slight problem coming up with the money.

425
00:30:12,581 --> 00:30:13,935
Oh, OK.

426
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:17,379
Well, why don't we just make it an even 90?

427
00:30:19,383 --> 00:30:21,533
I may have exaggerated the slightness.

428
00:30:23,384 --> 00:30:24,339
Hm.

429
00:30:24,424 --> 00:30:28,862
Well, why don't I just cancel the whole debt
in exchange for a small favor?

430
00:30:32,185 --> 00:30:34,142
Well, that depends on the favor.

431
00:30:37,347 --> 00:30:39,099
<i>THE BOSS: That was my son.</i>

432
00:30:40,147 --> 00:30:42,104
Notice how I said "was"?

433
00:30:43,027 --> 00:30:44,905
Yeah.

434
00:30:44,987 --> 00:30:46,944
That's because he's dead.

435
00:30:47,988 --> 00:30:49,900
Murdered.

436
00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:53,626
Relegated to the past tense.

437
00:30:55,669 --> 00:30:59,380
<i>Sent from an is to a was
before he'd had his breakfast.</i>

438
00:31:00,431 --> 00:31:02,183
Bummer.

439
00:31:08,512 --> 00:31:10,468
Lex Talionis.

440
00:31:10,553 --> 00:31:12,827
The Law of Retaliation.

441
00:31:27,876 --> 00:31:29,832
<i>A pact was broken.</i>

442
00:31:29,916 --> 00:31:33,592
My son was murdered,
so The Rabbi's son must share the same fate.

443
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:36,035
Whose son?

444
00:31:36,117 --> 00:31:37,755
The Rabbi's.

445
00:31:37,837 --> 00:31:39,794
Why do they call him The Rabbi?

446
00:31:39,877 --> 00:31:41,197
Because...

447
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:45,512
Because he's a rabbi.

448
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:47,555
Who's his son?

449
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:50,199
- Yitzchok.
- Yitzchok. Yitzchok and The Rabbi.

450
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,271
Yitzchok the Fairy.

451
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,597
Why do they call him The Fairy?

452
00:31:58,601 --> 00:32:00,797
Because he's a fairy.

453
00:32:00,881 --> 00:32:04,158
He has wings, can fly?
Sprinkles magic dust all over the place?

454
00:32:04,242 --> 00:32:06,198
- He's homosexual.
- Right.

455
00:32:06,282 --> 00:32:08,239
Come on.

456
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:13,958
- So how does The Rabbi feel about that?
- He doesn't know.

457
00:32:14,044 --> 00:32:16,194
- You know, but he doesn't?
- Everybody knows.

458
00:32:16,284 --> 00:32:18,036
- Except The Rabbi.
- That's right.

459
00:32:18,845 --> 00:32:20,801
So where do I fit in?

460
00:32:20,885 --> 00:32:22,478
You?

461
00:32:23,886 --> 00:32:25,842
You're the trigger man.

462
00:32:27,286 --> 00:32:28,686
Me?

463
00:32:28,766 --> 00:32:30,518
You.

464
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:41,167
Aren't there professionals?
People you can hire to do this sort of thing?

465
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:43,840
Of course there are.

466
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:44,885
Yes.

467
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:47,886
But you owe me $96,000.

468
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:51,930
Why should I go out and pay someone else
when I've already paid you?

469
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:57,962
Hm. Sorry, kid,
but your money just isn't long enough.

470
00:32:58,051 --> 00:32:59,531
Which means you're in my pocket.

471
00:32:59,612 --> 00:33:02,252
Which means
if you don't do what I want you to do,

472
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:04,801
you're gonna go from my pocket to my fridge.

473
00:33:06,813 --> 00:33:08,770
Slim could use the company.

474
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:10,651
I could use the Shmoo.

475
00:33:10,734 --> 00:33:12,804
So I'll expect your answer by morning.

476
00:33:14,374 --> 00:33:16,331
Is there anything else?

477
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:20,611
Well, I don't suppose I have to say anything
as trite and clichéd as,

478
00:33:20,696 --> 00:33:22,812
"Go to the police and you're a dead man."

479
00:33:22,896 --> 00:33:25,127
I think you just did.

480
00:33:25,216 --> 00:33:26,696
I guess I did.

481
00:33:30,418 --> 00:33:33,171
So, let me see if I've got this right.

482
00:33:35,739 --> 00:33:40,495
I'm paying you a lot of money to kill somebody
and you're getting somebody else to do it?

483
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:43,459
Don't worry.

484
00:33:44,501 --> 00:33:46,456
I'm gonna kill somebody.

485
00:33:52,742 --> 00:33:54,334
Better call Brikowski.

486
00:33:54,422 --> 00:33:55,980
Tell him there's a new face in town.

487
00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:34,186
- Hey.
- Nick still hasn't shown, huh?

488
00:34:34,269 --> 00:34:36,101
- No.
- What's with you and that towel?

489
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,747
Oh... Lindsey...

490
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,900
- It's a very long story.
- Get dressed, and tell me about it on the way.

491
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,265
Where are we going?

492
00:34:43,351 --> 00:34:46,184
All we know is that somebody called Nick
from the Hotel Cheval.

493
00:34:46,271 --> 00:34:48,228
<i>I spoke to a friend who works there.</i>

494
00:34:48,311 --> 00:34:50,268
<i>They keep a record of every call made.</i>

495
00:34:50,352 --> 00:34:54,630
<i>She can access the computer and we can
find out what room the call came from.</i>

496
00:34:54,713 --> 00:34:56,351
What is it?

497
00:34:56,433 --> 00:34:58,390
<i>- I know this guy.
- Who?</i>

498
00:34:58,473 --> 00:34:59,872
This guy.

499
00:35:01,274 --> 00:35:03,230
You know that guy?

500
00:35:03,314 --> 00:35:05,226
Yeah, I met him.

501
00:35:05,315 --> 00:35:06,668
He was dead.

502
00:35:09,116 --> 00:35:11,072
You met a dead guy?

503
00:35:11,156 --> 00:35:13,112
Yeah.

504
00:35:13,196 --> 00:35:15,153
In a walk-in freezer.

505
00:35:18,677 --> 00:35:21,750
Bookmaker Slim Hopkins reported missing.
Police have no leads.

506
00:35:21,837 --> 00:35:23,396
Blah, blah, blah. Yada, yada...

507
00:35:23,478 --> 00:35:27,358
A spokesperson commented off the record,
"Ironic that Hopkins should go missing,

508
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:32,069
considering he's allegedly been behind
a few disappearing acts himself."

509
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,232
I think it's time you told me that story
about why you're still wearing that towel.

510
00:35:39,321 --> 00:35:41,676
- Do you mind if I get dressed first?
- (Phone rings)

511
00:35:41,761 --> 00:35:44,401
Could be my friend from the hotel. Be right back.

512
00:35:47,882 --> 00:35:49,440
Hm.

513
00:36:00,004 --> 00:36:03,315
Hey, Lindsey, I don't think it's such a good idea
that we continue to...

514
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:07,441
Put your shoes on, Schlomo wants to see you.

515
00:36:11,006 --> 00:36:12,963
I don't know anyone named Schlomo.

516
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:17,478
Someone named Schlomo knows you.
That is your only concern.

517
00:36:17,568 --> 00:36:18,921
Let's go.

518
00:36:19,008 --> 00:36:20,761
Like I said, I don't know...

519
00:36:22,569 --> 00:36:24,525
Aaahh... better...

520
00:36:25,529 --> 00:36:28,090
I think it's better if you let me do the talking.

521
00:36:28,169 --> 00:36:29,603
You think?

522
00:36:35,491 --> 00:36:38,005
What is it?

523
00:36:40,052 --> 00:36:41,405
He's sorry that he hit you.

524
00:36:41,492 --> 00:36:43,449
<i>- Do you always speak for him?
- Yes.</i>

525
00:36:45,533 --> 00:36:47,205
Hm.

526
00:36:47,294 --> 00:36:49,250
So, he's a mute, then.

527
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:50,289
Not quite.

528
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,330
Well, what, then?

529
00:36:52,414 --> 00:36:54,882
It's personal. You'll have to ask him.

530
00:36:54,975 --> 00:36:56,931
- Hm. How would he tell me?
- He wouldn't.

531
00:37:01,736 --> 00:37:03,647
- Hey, are we going to the...?
- No.

532
00:37:03,736 --> 00:37:06,046
- But he's right there.
- A different outfit entirely.

533
00:37:07,497 --> 00:37:09,375
<i>Right across the street from one another?</i>

534
00:37:09,457 --> 00:37:13,610
At one time they were one with one another.
And then they tried to kill one another.

535
00:37:14,698 --> 00:37:19,136
<i>And now neither man leaves
his respective tower of isolation</i>

536
00:37:19,219 --> 00:37:21,574
for fear of what the other man will do to him.

537
00:37:30,461 --> 00:37:32,417
Let me guess, all the way up?

538
00:37:35,182 --> 00:37:37,138
Penthouse.

539
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:46,260
Gentle piano music

540
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:06,817
You must be Mr. Fisher.

541
00:38:09,308 --> 00:38:12,220
Must I? Because... that hasn't been
working out for me lately.

542
00:38:12,309 --> 00:38:14,948
- But I'm afraid you must.
- Well, if I must.

543
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:18,505
Do you know for what reason
you've been brought here?

544
00:38:22,191 --> 00:38:23,783
For starters, I'm unlucky.

545
00:38:23,871 --> 00:38:27,705
The unlucky are nothing more than
a frame of reference for the lucky, Mr. Fisher.

546
00:38:27,791 --> 00:38:30,545
You are unlucky so I may know that I am not.

547
00:38:30,632 --> 00:38:34,068
Unfortunately, the lucky never realize
they are lucky until it's too late.

548
00:38:34,153 --> 00:38:37,623
Take yourself for instance. Yesterday
you were better off than you are today,

549
00:38:37,714 --> 00:38:42,868
but it took today for you to realize it. But...
today has arrived, and it's too late, you see?

550
00:38:44,315 --> 00:38:46,226
<i>People are never happy with what they have.</i>

551
00:38:47,315 --> 00:38:50,625
They always want what they had,
or what someone else has.

552
00:38:50,715 --> 00:38:53,025
Kinda like a rabbi
who would rather be a gangster,

553
00:38:53,116 --> 00:38:55,027
a gangster who would rather be a rabbi.

554
00:38:55,116 --> 00:38:56,151
I mean, what is that?

555
00:38:56,237 --> 00:38:59,309
Some sort of grass is always greener
on the other side of the fence thing?

556
00:38:59,398 --> 00:39:02,549
<i>I mean, how do you justify being a rabbi</i>

557
00:39:02,638 --> 00:39:04,708
and a gangster?

558
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:10,191
I don't.

559
00:39:10,279 --> 00:39:13,237
I'm a bad man who doesn't waste time
wondering what could've been,

560
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,311
when I am what could've been or not have been.

561
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,030
I live on both sides of the fence,
and my grass is always green.

562
00:39:19,681 --> 00:39:21,637
Consider, Mr. Fisher...

563
00:39:22,321 --> 00:39:24,152
...there are two men sitting here before you,

564
00:39:24,241 --> 00:39:27,120
and one of them you should be very afraid of.
Where's my money?

565
00:39:28,403 --> 00:39:31,122
- I've been hearing that a lot lately.
- My father used to say,

566
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:33,797
"The first time somebody calls you a horse,
you punch him.

567
00:39:33,884 --> 00:39:36,523
The second time somebody calls you a horse,
call him a jerk.

568
00:39:36,603 --> 00:39:40,723
But the third time somebody calls you a horse,
perhaps it's time to go shopping for a saddle."

569
00:39:50,006 --> 00:39:53,682
- I don't have your money.
- This isn't like skipping out on the check.

570
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:57,043
You owe me money.
I have interests, you owe them money.

571
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:59,926
- I don't even know how much money I owe you.
- $33,000.

572
00:40:00,008 --> 00:40:02,317
- But I'm not Nick fisher.
- Then who the hell are you?

573
00:40:02,408 --> 00:40:05,560
I'm just a guy who was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

574
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:10,766
You have 48 hours to get my money.

575
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:14,082
Saul will keep an eye on you.
In the meantime, you may go now.

576
00:40:20,092 --> 00:40:21,445
Wait, I just have one question.

577
00:40:23,012 --> 00:40:24,969
I wasn't frisked.

578
00:40:30,334 --> 00:40:34,213
I see. So, being a rabbi, a... a religious man...

579
00:40:34,295 --> 00:40:38,493
There are three things a Jew may not do
in order to save a life, including his own.

580
00:40:38,575 --> 00:40:44,333
He may not idol-worship, commit adultery,
or perform an act of premeditated murder.

581
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:47,365
Killing you before you killed me
would have been...

582
00:40:47,456 --> 00:40:49,413
- Kosher.
- (Exhales)

583
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:53,413
Acceptable.

584
00:41:12,541 --> 00:41:14,896
I've wired half the money
to your bank in the Caymans.

585
00:41:14,982 --> 00:41:18,100
The other half will be deposited
when our old friend is in the ground.

586
00:41:18,182 --> 00:41:20,139
Now I can expect that when?

587
00:41:24,663 --> 00:41:26,699
- Very soon.
- Good.

588
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,378
So, tell me. The kid...

589
00:41:30,184 --> 00:41:32,141
<i>What do you want with him?</i>

590
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:36,375
The kid and I have unfinished business.

591
00:41:45,907 --> 00:41:48,627
If there's one thing I know,
it's when someone is lying.

592
00:41:48,707 --> 00:41:50,859
A man in my position, it's all he has to go on.

593
00:41:52,348 --> 00:41:55,819
To know a lie when he hears it,
it's the difference between life and death -

594
00:41:55,909 --> 00:41:57,581
your own, someone else's.

595
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:00,628
That being said, he wasn't lying.

596
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,143
That's not Nick Fisher.

597
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,305
I know.

598
00:42:15,673 --> 00:42:19,986
I came back here, you were gone. So,
I went to the hotel without you to see my friend.

599
00:42:20,074 --> 00:42:22,907
She says the call to Nick came from Room 1009.

600
00:42:22,994 --> 00:42:26,624
A fellow registered under the name of Smith,
if you can believe that.

601
00:42:26,714 --> 00:42:30,425
It's one of the most common names in the world,
so there's bound to be a couple of 'em.

602
00:42:30,515 --> 00:42:32,711
But I get the feeling that this ain't one of 'em.

603
00:42:32,795 --> 00:42:35,708
I get up to the tenth floor, and just as I do,

604
00:42:35,796 --> 00:42:39,551
the door to room 1009 opens
and there's our Mr. Smith. In the flesh.

605
00:42:39,637 --> 00:42:44,348
So, I pretend I'm walking to the elevator instead
of coming from it and we take it down together.

606
00:42:44,438 --> 00:42:46,474
He smiles at me - thanks - I smile back.

607
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:49,788
<i>But I have no idea who he is
but I think you might,</i>

608
00:42:49,879 --> 00:42:53,076
<i>so I take a picture using my cell phone
which I thought was a total waste</i>

609
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,594
cos the photos look like shit and I never use it.

610
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,630
So there I am pretending to dial a number,
and taking Smith's picture - him none the wiser.

611
00:43:01,481 --> 00:43:03,551
This is Smith. Recognize him?

612
00:43:03,641 --> 00:43:04,391
No.

613
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:09,798
I didn't think you would, but it was worth a shot.
Anyway, we take the elevator to the lobby,

614
00:43:09,882 --> 00:43:13,592
and the man who calls himself Smith
walks outside and hails himself a cab.

615
00:43:13,683 --> 00:43:15,435
So I followed him.

616
00:43:20,925 --> 00:43:23,917
<i>He went down
into an apartment building downtown.</i>

617
00:43:24,005 --> 00:43:26,075
<i>So I wait. An hour goes by.</i>

618
00:43:27,325 --> 00:43:30,363
And just when I'm getting ready to leave -
who walks outside?

619
00:43:30,446 --> 00:43:32,198
- Smith?
- You.

620
00:43:36,607 --> 00:43:37,357
Me?

621
00:43:39,247 --> 00:43:43,207
<i>You out of the same building
with two Hasidic Jews on either side of you.</i>

622
00:43:44,168 --> 00:43:46,000
Friends of yours?

623
00:43:47,009 --> 00:43:48,408
Not exactly.

624
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:50,640
I think it's time you told me that story.

625
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:55,088
Well, there's this guy
and they call him The Boss, right?

626
00:43:56,131 --> 00:43:59,407
And then, right across the street
there's this man they call The Rabbi.

627
00:43:59,492 --> 00:44:02,529
- Why do they call him The Rabbi?
- Because he's a rabbi.

628
00:44:10,013 --> 00:44:12,926
So now I have to "take out",
to use the vernacular,

629
00:44:13,014 --> 00:44:15,813
The Fairy, in order to scratch a debt
that isn't even mine.

630
00:44:15,894 --> 00:44:21,492
And if that's not enough, I have 48 hours to
come up with $33,000 or The Rabbi's gonna...

631
00:44:22,456 --> 00:44:24,412
I don't know who Mr. Smith is.

632
00:44:25,296 --> 00:44:28,130
And the worst part about it is,
I'm not Nick Fisher.

633
00:44:28,897 --> 00:44:29,647
Ironic.

634
00:44:30,657 --> 00:44:32,296
I know, I don't even gamble.

635
00:44:32,377 --> 00:44:35,414
No, I mean the mobster having a gay son.
That's ironic.

636
00:44:38,219 --> 00:44:41,017
We are dealing with a bona fide case
of mistaken identity here.

637
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:44,808
Things like that aren't supposed to be real.
It's like amnesia.

638
00:44:44,899 --> 00:44:49,018
Notwithstanding, here you are,
and Nick's nowhere to be found, so...

639
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,296
I'd say you're fucked.

640
00:44:51,381 --> 00:44:53,292
Fucked.

641
00:44:56,742 --> 00:44:58,858
Shouldn't you be a little worried about this?

642
00:44:58,943 --> 00:45:01,138
I have Ataraxia.

643
00:45:01,222 --> 00:45:02,372
Ataraxia?

644
00:45:03,463 --> 00:45:08,492
It's a condition characterized by freedom
from worry or any other preoccupation really.

645
00:45:10,745 --> 00:45:12,974
I have to have my answer
to The Boss in the morning.

646
00:45:13,064 --> 00:45:15,021
Oh, what are you gonna say?

647
00:45:16,345 --> 00:45:18,939
What a man with two penises would say
when his tailor asks him

648
00:45:19,026 --> 00:45:21,494
- if he dresses to the right or to the left.
- What's that?

649
00:45:24,067 --> 00:45:24,943
Yes.

650
00:45:25,867 --> 00:45:27,823
I knew you had sense.

651
00:45:29,387 --> 00:45:32,141
Sense is something you have
when you have a choice.

652
00:45:32,228 --> 00:45:33,980
Sometimes.

653
00:45:34,068 --> 00:45:36,424
Sometimes it's when you know you don't.

654
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:41,305
Nah, don't move that bishop!
It's an obvious sucker bet.

655
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:44,538
If you don't, y-y-you can have him in four moves.

656
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:46,940
If you do, he's gonna have you in mate in one.

657
00:45:49,831 --> 00:45:51,345
He doesn't see it.

658
00:45:51,432 --> 00:45:53,992
Wouldn't matter if he did.

659
00:45:54,072 --> 00:45:55,506
Elvis lets me win.

660
00:45:56,673 --> 00:45:58,709
<i>Everybody lets me win.</i>

661
00:45:59,473 --> 00:46:02,306
Wait a minute. You know this game?

662
00:46:09,395 --> 00:46:11,067
THE BOSS: You got three days.

663
00:46:12,795 --> 00:46:14,514
I was thinking it would take me a week.

664
00:46:14,595 --> 00:46:16,985
Oh, you were thinking that, were you?

665
00:46:17,077 --> 00:46:21,116
With all your experience killing people?
I'll tell you what.

666
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,108
You win this game, you got your week.

667
00:46:29,518 --> 00:46:30,156
Hm.

668
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,079
THE BOSS: So, what's the plan with Yitzchok?

669
00:46:44,481 --> 00:46:46,200
Was gonna play it by ear.

670
00:46:46,281 --> 00:46:49,319
Well, if it's all the same,
I'd write it down. It's a tough tune.

671
00:46:50,802 --> 00:46:52,794
And, by the way, he has shadows.

672
00:46:56,483 --> 00:46:58,236
Shadows?

673
00:47:02,165 --> 00:47:03,836
Bodyguards.

674
00:47:04,564 --> 00:47:06,521
With him all the time.

675
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:10,123
Military.

676
00:47:15,006 --> 00:47:16,963
Ex-Israeli Mossad.

677
00:47:18,367 --> 00:47:22,247
THE BOSS: They go where he goes,
round-the-clock. Ex-Israeli Mossad.

678
00:47:22,328 --> 00:47:24,284
Ex-Israeli Mossad.

679
00:47:26,809 --> 00:47:27,958
That doesn't sound good.

680
00:47:29,129 --> 00:47:31,279
<i>They live in the apartment next door.</i>

681
00:47:32,169 --> 00:47:34,366
He wears a panic button on a chain
around his neck.

682
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:36,487
<i>Looks like an ordinary Star of David.</i>

683
00:47:37,331 --> 00:47:40,562
He presses that button
and, well, we all know how that ends.

684
00:47:40,651 --> 00:47:42,004
What's this?

685
00:47:43,132 --> 00:47:44,200
Oh, God! No, you didn't?

686
00:47:47,173 --> 00:47:48,845
- Get down!
- (Silenced gunshot)

687
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:52,689
<i>Response time's gonna be
three to five seconds.</i>

688
00:47:53,414 --> 00:47:55,609
He's gonna have to hit him
when he least expects it.

689
00:47:55,694 --> 00:47:57,650
Where?

690
00:47:57,734 --> 00:48:00,454
- Where?
- The apartment.

691
00:48:01,775 --> 00:48:05,370
How do I get in his apartment?
I can't just walk in the front door.

692
00:48:06,096 --> 00:48:08,371
No, I was thinking you'd use the back door.

693
00:48:15,618 --> 00:48:17,609
Then what?

694
00:48:17,698 --> 00:48:19,848
He does the kid, I do him.

695
00:48:20,739 --> 00:48:23,207
I plant my gun. Clean, no history.

696
00:48:23,299 --> 00:48:27,293
And Yitzchok - fire a round,
get some powder burns on the hands.

697
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:32,170
Take the clothes off- make it look like a,

698
00:48:32,261 --> 00:48:36,778
"You do me, I do you, we're both gay, the
world doesn't understand us," double suicide.

699
00:48:38,062 --> 00:48:39,814
And that's all there is to it.

700
00:48:40,902 --> 00:48:42,972
Is that all there is to it?

701
00:48:43,063 --> 00:48:45,452
Yeah. It's all there is to it.

702
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:54,934
Peww!

703
00:48:57,825 --> 00:48:59,862
I'm not such a bad guy, you know.

704
00:49:01,506 --> 00:49:03,656
<i>Some folks have grown pretty fat off me.</i>

705
00:49:06,307 --> 00:49:08,263
Some have grown pretty dead.

706
00:49:12,668 --> 00:49:14,067
You're a conundrum, you.

707
00:49:16,309 --> 00:49:20,746
You walk in here shooting your fucking mouth off
like you don't give a fuck if it gets shot off.

708
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:23,343
You can only kill me once.

709
00:49:31,031 --> 00:49:31,782
Checkmate.

710
00:49:38,033 --> 00:49:39,989
Nobody says I have to kill you quick.

711
00:49:43,234 --> 00:49:44,986
Cat.

712
00:49:46,034 --> 00:49:47,786
Mouse.

713
00:49:49,395 --> 00:49:51,351
You've got three days.

714
00:49:55,155 --> 00:49:57,112
Excuse me.

715
00:50:17,079 --> 00:50:18,638
Who the fuck is this guy?

716
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,911
<i>Dunno. But whoever he is, he's either in
very deep shit or I don't know what,</i>

717
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,677
because he's playing in the sandbox with
the Darkies, the Skullcaps and who knows who.

718
00:50:27,762 --> 00:50:31,641
Call Murph and see if he got a match
on that photo Marty snapped.

719
00:50:31,723 --> 00:50:33,714
Yes, boss.

720
00:50:33,803 --> 00:50:37,079
I want a complete rundown on this fucker.
Everything from A to Z.

721
00:50:37,163 --> 00:50:40,041
Who he is. Who does he know?
The people he knows, who do they know?

722
00:50:40,124 --> 00:50:43,481
I want to know
what the fuck he is doing in my fucking city.

723
00:50:53,206 --> 00:50:54,639
- What have you got?
- Get this.

724
00:50:54,726 --> 00:50:57,116
The Kat's in town.

725
00:50:57,207 --> 00:50:58,356
Good Kat?

726
00:50:58,447 --> 00:51:01,008
- It's the song junkies are singing.
- What's the happenstance?

727
00:51:01,088 --> 00:51:04,250
Didn't know the happenstance.
Just said the word was the Kat's in town.

728
00:51:04,263 --> 00:51:06,493
Um... who's er... who's Good Kat?

729
00:51:06,583 --> 00:51:09,017
<i>Real heavy hitter.</i>

730
00:51:09,102 --> 00:51:12,014
- The heaviest.
- He shows, people die, he vanishes.

731
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:14,536
No-one knows who he is, or what he looks like.

732
00:51:14,623 --> 00:51:17,500
And he hasn't worked New York
in, like, two decades.

733
00:51:17,582 --> 00:51:19,538
<i>Just what we need.</i>

734
00:51:19,622 --> 00:51:20,736
All right.

735
00:51:21,502 --> 00:51:26,450
And get some different fucking coffee in here,
will you? I gotta get to the fucking morgue.

736
00:51:34,141 --> 00:51:37,099
- Hey! I figured it out.
- Hey. What did you figure out?

737
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,614
You said that Slim Hopkins worked
for The Boss, right?

738
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,418
Well, listen.

739
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,330
The Rabbi also had a bookie - Benny Begin.

740
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:46,092
Benny's at the morgue.
Somebody killed him and his goons.

741
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:48,329
- The morgue?
- Didn't I say I was a coroner?

742
00:51:48,419 --> 00:51:50,092
No, you didn't say you were a coroner.

743
00:51:53,019 --> 00:51:54,975
Benny Begin - killed by a baseball.

744
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:57,417
My guess was a fastball.

745
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:02,335
Well, either way it proves
that the good Lord has a sense of humor.

746
00:52:02,418 --> 00:52:04,136
- Good morning, Detective.
- Morning.

747
00:52:04,218 --> 00:52:07,335
- You know this guy?
- Big-time bookie. Worked for The Rabbi.

748
00:52:07,418 --> 00:52:10,251
- Why do they call him The Rabbi?
- Because he's a rabbi.

749
00:52:10,338 --> 00:52:12,169
Between you and me...

750
00:52:13,017 --> 00:52:16,646
20 years ago he used to be my bookie.
I used to sign my pay cheques over to him.

751
00:52:17,977 --> 00:52:20,536
What about the other two?
Did you get anything on them yet?

752
00:52:20,617 --> 00:52:22,494
These two were poisoned.

753
00:52:22,576 --> 00:52:24,932
Something exotic.

754
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:27,291
- I'm running it down.
- Well, let me know.

755
00:52:27,376 --> 00:52:29,128
<i>Will do.</i>

756
00:52:29,856 --> 00:52:30,606
Prick.

757
00:52:34,416 --> 00:52:37,168
- Have a good day.
- You too, Detective.

758
00:52:41,695 --> 00:52:43,572
Jimmy, I'm taking my lunch break.

759
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:48,684
Don't you see?
Nick isn't missing, he's hiding. He set you up.

760
00:52:48,774 --> 00:52:50,527
- Nick set me up?
- Like a bowling pin.

761
00:52:50,614 --> 00:52:53,082
Nick found himself in a jam.
He got you to take his place.

762
00:52:53,174 --> 00:52:56,688
He paid a street thug to mug you,
but all he wants is your wallet and license

763
00:52:56,774 --> 00:52:58,526
<i>so he ignores the watch and suitcase.</i>

764
00:52:58,613 --> 00:53:00,365
<i>Then Nick kills Slim Hopkins and Benny,</i>

765
00:53:00,454 --> 00:53:03,889
the only guys who know what he looks like,
and now you're left holding the bag!

766
00:53:03,973 --> 00:53:07,522
- But I called Nick. I initiated contact.
- Well, maybe it just seems that way.

767
00:53:07,613 --> 00:53:10,286
- What about Smith?
- I still can't figure him out in all this.

768
00:53:10,373 --> 00:53:11,692
Hm.

769
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:14,081
- You should run.
- I can't.

770
00:53:14,173 --> 00:53:16,845
- They'll kill you if you stay.
- They'll kill me if I leave.

771
00:53:16,932 --> 00:53:19,810
- Go to the police!
- These guys buy cops like cops buy doughnuts.

772
00:53:19,891 --> 00:53:21,848
This isn't the first time this has happened.

773
00:53:21,931 --> 00:53:25,287
This isn't the first time a crime lord asked you
to kill the gay son of a rival

774
00:53:25,371 --> 00:53:28,920
to pay off a friend's debt whose place you're
staying in because you lost your job

775
00:53:29,011 --> 00:53:30,922
and found your girlfriend with another guy?

776
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:35,687
It is the first time it happened. But Nick has been
painting me into a corner since we were kids.

777
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:37,965
I guess I've always been a better friend to him...

778
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:41,803
Yeah, I'd love to hear the rest of this
but I've really gotta go back to work.

779
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:45,960
- Oh, hey. Hey.
- Hey.

780
00:53:46,049 --> 00:53:50,565
I was just thinking that if you're still alive
when I get back from work tonight, maybe...

781
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:54,164
I don't know,
we could go to dinner or something?

782
00:53:57,969 --> 00:53:59,402
Yeah, that would be great, yeah.

783
00:53:59,488 --> 00:54:01,445
- Really?
- Yeah.

784
00:54:01,528 --> 00:54:03,007
- (Chuckles)
- Yeah.

785
00:54:03,088 --> 00:54:06,000
OK. Um... No. Bye.

786
00:54:11,208 --> 00:54:12,960
Hm...

787
00:54:14,287 --> 00:54:15,515
Weird.

788
00:54:25,246 --> 00:54:26,725
What?

789
00:54:26,806 --> 00:54:30,845
I was just thinking about what it would be like
if we'd met under different circumstances.

790
00:54:30,926 --> 00:54:34,838
See, I think people should only fall in love
if there's a great story behind how they met.

791
00:54:35,685 --> 00:54:38,518
You know, seeing as you have to tell it
over and over again.

792
00:54:39,566 --> 00:54:43,001
If you and I fell in love,
we'd have one hell of a story to tell.

793
00:54:43,085 --> 00:54:46,157
We'd be at a dinner party and someone
would ask, "How'd you two meet?"

794
00:54:46,244 --> 00:54:51,365
And I'd say, "You tell the story, dear."
And you'd say, "No, you tell it better."

795
00:54:54,764 --> 00:54:55,992
So, come here often?

796
00:54:58,364 --> 00:55:01,673
No. But I heard about someone who does.

797
00:55:03,963 --> 00:55:05,794
- You mean... The Fairy?
- Yeah.

798
00:55:05,883 --> 00:55:07,839
- Is he...?
- Yeah.

799
00:55:08,602 --> 00:55:09,352
Where?

800
00:55:15,722 --> 00:55:17,394
This is absurd. What are you thinking?

801
00:55:18,842 --> 00:55:20,560
- I'm thinking of a new option.
- What?

802
00:55:20,642 --> 00:55:22,473
- Talking with him.
- Talking with him?

803
00:55:22,561 --> 00:55:23,233
Talking.

804
00:55:23,322 --> 00:55:27,281
You're gonna go over and say, "I'm Slevin,
some bad dudes think I am someone I am not.

805
00:55:27,361 --> 00:55:30,159
And I'm gonna have to take you out
or they're gonna take me out

806
00:55:30,241 --> 00:55:32,390
and I was wondering,
you wanna talk about it?"

807
00:55:32,481 --> 00:55:34,517
- I can't do that.
- You think?

808
00:55:34,601 --> 00:55:37,115
Look, I can't just walk over there.
He's got bodyguards.

809
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,919
Aside from that, you're pretty much dead-on.

810
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,709
- Bodyguards?
- Yeah. Right behind him. Two of them. Israelis.

811
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,271
Beards. Right behind him.

812
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,155
<i>See 'em?</i>

813
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:53,875
- You're getting good at this.
- Thanks.

814
00:55:53,959 --> 00:55:55,677
How are you gonna have a talk with him?

815
00:55:55,759 --> 00:55:58,034
When he goes to the bathroom,
I'll follow him in.

816
00:55:58,879 --> 00:56:00,835
What do you think?

817
00:56:01,719 --> 00:56:03,868
<i>Could someone tell me why I'm in the van?</i>

818
00:56:05,318 --> 00:56:07,434
<i>Because I could only get a reservation for two.</i>

819
00:56:08,718 --> 00:56:11,391
<i>All right, The Fairy's at a table in the middle.</i>

820
00:56:11,478 --> 00:56:12,830
<i>Bodyguards nearby.</i>

821
00:56:12,918 --> 00:56:16,796
<i>Our boy's not far away
but I can't make out who's with him.</i>

822
00:56:16,877 --> 00:56:20,426
<i>- Did Murph get a beat on him yet?
- Murph says, whoever he is, he's a ghost.</i>

823
00:56:20,517 --> 00:56:24,032
<i>Can't find anyone who's ever even
bumped into him, much less tripped over him.</i>

824
00:56:28,756 --> 00:56:30,906
<i>The Fairy's going to the bathroom.</i>

825
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:36,824
<i>And our boy's making a move. Shit.</i>

826
00:56:57,634 --> 00:56:59,942
<i>- Marty, the door's locked.
- Relax.</i>

827
00:57:00,033 --> 00:57:02,673
It's not gonna go down in the men's room.

828
00:57:06,553 --> 00:57:08,509
I got it next.

829
00:57:11,272 --> 00:57:13,343
- What went down in the men's room?
- We talked.

830
00:57:13,433 --> 00:57:14,182
And?

831
00:57:14,272 --> 00:57:16,263
I told him I thought we should get together.

832
00:57:16,352 --> 00:57:17,705
- You didn't?
- I did.

833
00:57:17,792 --> 00:57:19,623
And?

834
00:57:19,712 --> 00:57:22,545
- I got a date.
- Do you think this is safe?

835
00:57:22,632 --> 00:57:26,510
It can't be any worse than what's waiting for me
behind door number two.

836
00:57:27,671 --> 00:57:29,866
It's gonna be tough. I think I picked up a pigtail.

837
00:57:29,951 --> 00:57:32,067
- A what?
- The cops.

838
00:57:32,151 --> 00:57:35,302
Oh, a pig tail. Cute.

839
00:57:37,151 --> 00:57:39,459
I ran into a nosy cop in the men's room.

840
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:50,305
You and me need to talk.

841
00:57:53,349 --> 00:57:56,341
- Do I know you?
- No, but I know you.

842
00:58:03,668 --> 00:58:05,659
Listen, I'm sorry, no offence, but I'm not...

843
00:58:05,749 --> 00:58:07,386
I'm not gay.

844
00:58:07,468 --> 00:58:11,461
- I'm a cop.
- Well, I'm not a robber if you catch my drift?

845
00:58:12,427 --> 00:58:14,179
I've been watching you.

846
00:58:14,268 --> 00:58:18,863
I know what you're into.
Who are you? I mean, I know who you're not.

847
00:58:18,947 --> 00:58:21,586
You're not Nick Fisher.
The guy whose apartment you're in.

848
00:58:21,667 --> 00:58:24,306
I know because Nick
spent eight years in Dade Correctional

849
00:58:24,387 --> 00:58:27,220
for forcing himself on a 14-year-old cheerleader.

850
00:58:27,307 --> 00:58:29,262
Dade County sent me a picture of Nick Fisher.

851
00:58:29,346 --> 00:58:31,223
And you... are not him.

852
00:58:31,306 --> 00:58:34,582
So... who the fuck are you?

853
00:58:38,585 --> 00:58:40,941
I'm just a guy whose dinner's getting cold.

854
00:58:42,145 --> 00:58:43,976
May I leave now?

855
00:58:44,065 --> 00:58:45,737
- Come here.
- What?

856
00:58:45,825 --> 00:58:50,774
Dead bodies in refrigerators. Cops in men's
rooms. You remind me of... James Bond.

857
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:57,419
That is the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

858
00:58:57,504 --> 00:58:59,381
And The Boss, he could be Kananga.

859
00:58:59,463 --> 00:59:00,213
Kananga?

860
00:59:01,824 --> 00:59:04,098
- No, The Boss is no Kananga.
- Well, who's The Boss?

861
00:59:04,183 --> 00:59:06,139
Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

862
00:59:07,024 --> 00:59:10,459
Which one? Donald Pleasance?
Telly Savalas? Max von Sydow?

863
00:59:11,343 --> 00:59:14,732
You know your Bond.
But alas, I was referring to Anthony Dawson.

864
00:59:14,822 --> 00:59:16,380
Who?

865
00:59:16,462 --> 00:59:19,056
Well, he played Blofeld
in From Russia With Love.

866
00:59:19,142 --> 00:59:22,452
Well, you never see Blofeld's face
in From Russia With Love.

867
00:59:22,542 --> 00:59:26,739
And that's when the villain is most effective,
when you don't know what he looks like.

868
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:45,656
So...

869
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:50,255
See you later.

870
01:00:16,018 --> 01:00:18,976
SLEVIN: Ah, that was incredible!
- (Giggles) You...

871
01:00:22,177 --> 01:00:25,134
- I just realized something.
- What's that?

872
01:00:25,217 --> 01:00:28,208
- I just made love to you.
- You're just realizing that now?

873
01:00:28,296 --> 01:00:32,653
And I have no idea who specifically you were
referring to when you said James Bond.

874
01:00:32,736 --> 01:00:36,854
Because earlier when you were telling me
that I reminded you of James Bond,

875
01:00:36,935 --> 01:00:40,928
and I was saying that it was the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me,

876
01:00:41,015 --> 01:00:42,050
I naturally assumed...

877
01:00:42,135 --> 01:00:45,207
You naturally assumed
you knew who I was talking about.

878
01:00:50,494 --> 01:00:54,965
Because if you don't - if you weren't talking
about the guy I think that you're talking about,

879
01:00:55,055 --> 01:00:59,809
well, you have me mistaken for somebody else,
because in my mind there is only one Bond.

880
01:01:00,734 --> 01:01:02,964
Well, on that we agree.

881
01:01:05,214 --> 01:01:06,487
Same time on three.

882
01:01:06,574 --> 01:01:08,211
- One...
- Two...

883
01:01:08,293 --> 01:01:10,045
- Three. George Lazenby.
- Roger Moore.

884
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:12,407
- George Lazenby?
- Roger Moore? I was kidding.

885
01:01:12,493 --> 01:01:13,972
- Yeah, I was kidding.
- You were?

886
01:01:14,052 --> 01:01:16,009
The only James Bond is...

887
01:01:16,092 --> 01:01:18,128
- Timothy Dalton.
- Pierce Brosnan.

888
01:01:21,252 --> 01:01:23,447
- Scotland forever.
- I feel so much better.

889
01:01:55,289 --> 01:01:57,245
Why are you going?

890
01:01:57,929 --> 01:01:59,885
I'm just going to get us some coffee.

891
01:02:00,889 --> 01:02:02,641
OK.

892
01:02:05,929 --> 01:02:07,884
Hurry back to me.

893
01:02:08,648 --> 01:02:10,001
WENDY RENE: After Laughter

894
01:02:10,088 --> 01:02:17,038
When you're in love, you're happy

895
01:02:17,608 --> 01:02:21,680
Oh, and when you're in her arms

896
01:02:21,767 --> 01:02:26,794
You gain

897
01:02:28,606 --> 01:02:31,040
After...

898
01:02:31,126 --> 01:02:33,082
Hey! Police.

899
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:35,122
Aw, come on, man.

900
01:02:35,206 --> 01:02:37,674
I already talked to your buddy.

901
01:02:38,485 --> 01:02:42,273
After...
After your laughter

902
01:02:45,965 --> 01:02:48,320
Good morning. I'm Detective Dumbrowski.

903
01:02:48,405 --> 01:02:50,555
Good morning, Detective.
Am I being kidnapped?

904
01:02:50,645 --> 01:02:53,636
Nope. We just want to have
a quick, friendly word with you.

905
01:02:53,724 --> 01:02:57,239
Is this standard operating procedure
you'd find in the policeman's manual

906
01:02:57,325 --> 01:02:58,837
if you look up "quick, friendly word"?

907
01:02:58,924 --> 01:03:01,517
There is no SOP for the box
you got yourself into.

908
01:03:01,604 --> 01:03:02,957
Oh.

909
01:03:07,163 --> 01:03:10,041
- So what do you want to talk to me about?
- You.

910
01:03:10,123 --> 01:03:12,239
- What about me?
- Who are you?

911
01:03:12,323 --> 01:03:13,835
- Philosophically speaking?
- Name.

912
01:03:13,923 --> 01:03:16,390
- Rank, serial number...
- You should really play ball.

913
01:03:16,482 --> 01:03:18,439
You think I'm tall enough?

914
01:03:28,521 --> 01:03:32,036
- What is your name?
- Oh, yeah, I remember. Slevin Kelevra.

915
01:03:32,121 --> 01:03:34,351
K-E-L-E-V-R-A.

916
01:03:34,441 --> 01:03:37,160
<i>- Kelevra.
- Look, kid,</i>

917
01:03:37,241 --> 01:03:40,233
I don't know what's going on,
or how you're into this,

918
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,789
but when I figure out what there is to figure out,

919
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,711
I'm not gonna be so nice to you.

920
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,750
Oh, this is nice. Don't do me any favors.

921
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,995
<i>Last chance to come clean.</i>

922
01:03:57,559 --> 01:03:59,515
Take a walk.

923
01:04:00,679 --> 01:04:03,476
I think this is the part
where you tell me not to walk too far.

924
01:04:49,915 --> 01:04:53,111
When you're in love

925
01:04:53,195 --> 01:04:57,073
You're happy

926
01:04:57,674 --> 01:05:01,586
Oh, and when you're in her arms

927
01:05:01,674 --> 01:05:06,463
You gain

928
01:05:08,593 --> 01:05:13,462
After
This doesn't matter...

929
01:05:13,553 --> 01:05:14,906
I have to go to work.

930
01:05:15,953 --> 01:05:17,908
Hey.

931
01:05:18,512 --> 01:05:20,468
After
After...

932
01:05:43,751 --> 01:05:46,708
- Hey, guys, what are you doing here?
- Now's the time.

933
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:50,025
I've got at least... Jesus.

934
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:53,385
The Boss says he wants you to look nice
for The Fairy.

935
01:07:08,663 --> 01:07:10,415
You're early.

936
01:07:13,303 --> 01:07:17,136
Why don't you come in and fix yourself a drink?
I was just getting ready.

937
01:07:28,581 --> 01:07:30,254
<i>You'll have to excuse the...</i>

938
01:07:30,341 --> 01:07:32,093
I wasn't expecting you for...

939
01:07:35,021 --> 01:07:36,773
<i>You look good.</i>

940
01:07:37,581 --> 01:07:39,889
<i>- You want some wine?
- No.</i>

941
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:41,937
Is something the matter?

942
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:47,138
Somebody's trying to kill you.

943
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:50,852
Who?

944
01:07:53,779 --> 01:07:54,769
Me.

945
01:08:46,415 --> 01:08:48,770
- That was close.
- Yeah.

946
01:10:04,289 --> 01:10:05,324
Close.

947
01:11:25,482 --> 01:11:27,438
<i>THE BOSS: I hired you to do a job.</i>

948
01:11:28,962 --> 01:11:30,998
It wasn't supposed to look like a job.

949
01:11:32,922 --> 01:11:37,915
So you take out the Israelis,
bomb the damn building...

950
01:11:39,681 --> 01:11:42,957
and now the job
that was not supposed to look like a job's

951
01:11:43,041 --> 01:11:45,270
beginning to look very much

952
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,316
like a job.

953
01:11:55,919 --> 01:11:57,875
All right. Fuck it.

954
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:02,355
If the Rabbi wants a war...

955
01:12:03,239 --> 01:12:05,706
...l'll give him a war.

956
01:12:12,718 --> 01:12:14,470
Saul.

957
01:12:17,078 --> 01:12:19,467
- Saul.

958
01:12:19,918 --> 01:12:22,113
<i>Saul, the phone's been...</i>

959
01:12:22,197 --> 01:12:24,154
Oh.

960
01:12:24,237 --> 01:12:26,193
I thought you were Saul.

961
01:12:28,797 --> 01:12:31,027
People have been thinking I'm somebody else.

962
01:12:34,477 --> 01:12:36,910
Your predicament reminds me of a story.

963
01:12:36,996 --> 01:12:39,351
Hitchcock. North By Northwest.

964
01:12:40,195 --> 01:12:43,949
The movie where everybody thinks Cary Grant
is a man named George Kaplan,

965
01:12:44,035 --> 01:12:47,028
but the thing is there is no George Kaplan.
It's just a made-up name.

966
01:12:47,115 --> 01:12:49,470
But names, even made-up ones...

967
01:12:51,915 --> 01:12:54,145
...can bring about quite a bit of trouble.

968
01:12:56,074 --> 01:12:57,474
Now...

969
01:12:57,554 --> 01:12:59,704
the woman in the picture with Grant,

970
01:12:59,794 --> 01:13:02,149
<i>- her name was er...
- Eva Marie Saint.</i>

971
01:13:02,234 --> 01:13:04,987
- Oh... you know this movie.
- I know this movie.

972
01:13:05,074 --> 01:13:08,146
I took my father to see it in 1959.
His English wasn't very good,

973
01:13:08,234 --> 01:13:11,066
but boy, did he like Miss Saint.

974
01:13:11,153 --> 01:13:13,951
After the movie he turned to me and he said,
"She's a real Buick."

975
01:13:14,033 --> 01:13:17,423
You see, he couldn't pronounce
the word beauty, so he'd say Buick.

976
01:13:18,712 --> 01:13:22,466
- Caused quite a bit of confusion.
- Using the wrong name'll do that.

977
01:13:26,672 --> 01:13:28,503
Is that my money?

978
01:13:28,592 --> 01:13:29,945
This is everything I owe you.

979
01:14:03,189 --> 01:14:06,977
It's the Sabbath. You see,
we don't answer the phone on the Sabbath.

980
01:14:07,069 --> 01:14:08,865
I know.

981
01:14:08,949 --> 01:14:10,745
Normally Saul turns off the ringer.

982
01:14:10,829 --> 01:14:11,978
Saul!

983
01:14:12,069 --> 01:14:14,628
I tell you, you can't find good help these days.

984
01:14:18,467 --> 01:14:20,663
Saul's dead.

985
01:14:23,347 --> 01:14:24,575
<i>They're all dead.</i>

986
01:14:48,065 --> 01:14:50,022
Oh, I've been in this room before.

987
01:14:52,465 --> 01:14:54,421
Looks the same as it did 20 years ago.

988
01:14:55,665 --> 01:14:57,620
Somehow...

989
01:14:58,464 --> 01:14:59,817
Somehow it seems different.

990
01:14:59,905 --> 01:15:03,533
The way your car seems different
when someone else is driving it.

991
01:15:04,784 --> 01:15:07,821
Then again, it's been 20 years
since I've been in a car.

992
01:15:09,063 --> 01:15:12,101
Two decades spent behind three inches
of bulletproof glass

993
01:15:12,183 --> 01:15:16,779
due to a natural fear of high-powered rifles
and quiet... rooftops in New Jersey.

994
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:18,819
20 years...

995
01:15:20,743 --> 01:15:24,019
...locked away in my own paranoia,
a prisoner in my own home.

996
01:15:26,422 --> 01:15:29,175
Only to be delivered to fate by a boy.

997
01:15:32,781 --> 01:15:36,933
<i>Well, Anthony, it looks as though you've won,
if such a term may be applied.</i>

998
01:15:39,261 --> 01:15:41,536
<i>If I were wearing a hat, I would take it off.</i>

999
01:15:45,461 --> 01:15:47,018
Should we get on with it, then?

1000
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:55,256
You can keep your hat on, Schlomo.

1001
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:03,495
Looks like we were sold a bill of goods
by the same salesman.

1002
01:16:05,979 --> 01:16:07,935
Nice speech, though.

1003
01:16:11,658 --> 01:16:13,888
I wish I was standing for it.

1004
01:16:24,498 --> 01:16:26,647
You... you brought this upon our heads.

1005
01:16:28,937 --> 01:16:32,896
- Me?
- You... you hired Good Kat to kill my son.

1006
01:16:34,777 --> 01:16:36,732
After you murdered my son?

1007
01:16:38,457 --> 01:16:41,209
- I had no hand in that.
- Oh, sure.

1008
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:43,252
Just like in '84?

1009
01:16:43,776 --> 01:16:47,212
I suppose you had no hand in that either.
Just a finger, maybe?

1010
01:16:49,856 --> 01:16:51,811
Time's up, Rabbi.

1011
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:56,207
Lying to a dead man's
the same as lying to yourself.

1012
01:17:00,054 --> 01:17:02,011
You were getting too big.

1013
01:17:03,814 --> 01:17:05,770
See...

1014
01:17:07,014 --> 01:17:09,050
...problem when two men are standing in a room

1015
01:17:09,133 --> 01:17:11,932
is you can only look at one of them
and they were looking at you

1016
01:17:12,013 --> 01:17:15,369
with their backs turned,
their shirt collars smiling at me.

1017
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:19,286
Then they called you The Boss.

1018
01:17:22,253 --> 01:17:24,208
It was clear what had to be done.

1019
01:17:30,452 --> 01:17:33,171
Try and appreciate how it feels, Schlomo...

1020
01:17:35,571 --> 01:17:39,325
...to wake up in the middle of the night
with six bullets burning in your stomach.

1021
01:17:40,171 --> 01:17:42,401
Lying in a pool of your own blood and shit.

1022
01:17:46,611 --> 01:17:48,566
The dead eyes of...

1023
01:17:51,890 --> 01:17:54,404
...of your wife... staring back at you.

1024
01:17:58,050 --> 01:18:00,006
The only thing keeping you from passing out

1025
01:18:00,090 --> 01:18:03,048
is the sound of the footsteps of the man
going down the hall...

1026
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:06,365
...looking for your son.

1027
01:18:11,368 --> 01:18:13,325
I managed to save my son, Schlomo.

1028
01:18:14,969 --> 01:18:16,924
And now...

1029
01:18:18,048 --> 01:18:20,084
...after all these years...

1030
01:18:21,927 --> 01:18:23,406
...in spite of our agreement!

1031
01:18:24,647 --> 01:18:26,206
You... you...

1032
01:18:26,287 --> 01:18:29,165
fucking backstabbing Philistine.

1033
01:18:30,048 --> 01:18:32,117
You managed to take my son away from me.

1034
01:18:33,607 --> 01:18:35,563
Well...

1035
01:18:36,767 --> 01:18:38,803
...now I've taken your son away from you.

1036
01:18:38,886 --> 01:18:41,798
I told you I had nothing to do with...

1037
01:18:50,606 --> 01:18:52,436
You haven't heard.

1038
01:18:52,525 --> 01:18:54,481
Will I?

1039
01:18:55,045 --> 01:18:58,593
Look at my face, Schlomo. Look at my smile.

1040
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:02,082
Your son is dead.

1041
01:19:05,324 --> 01:19:07,393
Your son is dead.

1042
01:19:09,964 --> 01:19:12,477
I'm gonna kill you. Hm.

1043
01:19:14,723 --> 01:19:15,792
<i>SLEVIN: Rabbi.</i>

1044
01:19:17,043 --> 01:19:19,034
<i>Are you familiar with the Shmoo?</i>

1045
01:19:30,882 --> 01:19:32,838
Fisher.

1046
01:19:34,642 --> 01:19:36,597
Fisher, listen to me.

1047
01:19:39,321 --> 01:19:41,789
I already told you,

1048
01:19:41,882 --> 01:19:43,837
I'm not Nick Fisher.

1049
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,917
Then who is Nick Fisher?

1050
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:59,037
I think you mean, who was Nick Fisher?

1051
01:20:00,639 --> 01:20:02,437
Fisher was the answer to a question.

1052
01:20:02,519 --> 01:20:05,158
How do you get to two men
that can't be gotten to?

1053
01:20:12,798 --> 01:20:14,755
<i>You get them to come to you.</i>

1054
01:20:22,437 --> 01:20:24,871
<i>But to do that... I needed a name.</i>

1055
01:20:25,677 --> 01:20:27,748
<i>And where do you find names?</i>

1056
01:20:27,838 --> 01:20:29,828
<i>In books.</i>

1057
01:20:34,037 --> 01:20:35,549
<i>And who has books?</i>

1058
01:20:43,316 --> 01:20:45,272
<i>Well, your bookies have books.</i>

1059
01:20:47,036 --> 01:20:48,150
He's clean.

1060
01:20:48,236 --> 01:20:50,191
<i>SLEVIN: Crooked bookies...</i>

1061
01:20:50,996 --> 01:20:53,953
<i>- ... who work with big-time crooks.
- So... why are you here?</i>

1062
01:21:05,154 --> 01:21:06,827
<i>I was looking for a gambler.</i>

1063
01:21:08,394 --> 01:21:10,066
<i>One who was in both books...</i>

1064
01:21:10,794 --> 01:21:13,069
<i>... with a lot of red in the minus column.</i>

1065
01:21:13,153 --> 01:21:14,269
Got him.

1066
01:21:14,353 --> 01:21:16,310
<i>And that's when I found Nick Fisher.</i>

1067
01:21:16,913 --> 01:21:18,949
<i>A lowlife that no-one was gonna miss.</i>

1068
01:21:20,593 --> 01:21:21,912
1729.

1069
01:21:21,993 --> 01:21:24,143
Nick Fisher.

1070
01:21:24,232 --> 01:21:26,189
OK.

1071
01:21:37,431 --> 01:21:39,387
<i>GOODKAT: There was a time.</i>

1072
01:21:55,430 --> 01:21:57,943
All that was left to do was make the phone ring.

1073
01:22:17,668 --> 01:22:21,263
<i>All I had to do was pull the trigger
and wait for you to call the man</i>

1074
01:22:21,348 --> 01:22:23,578
<i>who does the jobs that no-one else wants.</i>

1075
01:22:25,628 --> 01:22:27,584
<i>THE BOSS: I want an outsider brought in.</i>

1076
01:22:28,988 --> 01:22:31,103
There's a specialist.

1077
01:22:33,226 --> 01:22:35,217
Calls himself Mr. Good Kat.

1078
01:22:41,026 --> 01:22:42,982
Fine.

1079
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:46,776
Tell him he can expect me in the morning.

1080
01:22:51,265 --> 01:22:53,222
Are you ready?

1081
01:22:53,305 --> 01:22:55,261
Yeah.

1082
01:22:58,225 --> 01:23:00,180
It's just that one last thing.

1083
01:23:08,784 --> 01:23:10,137
<i>THE BOSS: Mr. Good Kat.</i>

1084
01:23:11,104 --> 01:23:12,742
It's been a long time.

1085
01:23:16,903 --> 01:23:21,374
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, Mr. Good Kat.
So I'll get right down to business.

1086
01:23:22,463 --> 01:23:26,171
Slim Hopkins, the man who ran my book,
was hit yesterday.

1087
01:23:27,823 --> 01:23:29,972
And I guess you've already heard about...

1088
01:23:31,422 --> 01:23:33,936
<i>- ... my son.
- Yes, I heard.</i>

1089
01:23:34,901 --> 01:23:36,654
I need you to sort it out for me.

1090
01:23:36,742 --> 01:23:38,380
Who's the mark?

1091
01:23:38,461 --> 01:23:39,975
Yitzchok.

1092
01:23:43,221 --> 01:23:44,780
Yitzchok, The Rabbi's son?

1093
01:23:44,861 --> 01:23:46,977
<i>You remember The Rabbi?</i>

1094
01:23:47,061 --> 01:23:48,812
I remember The Rabbi well.

1095
01:23:48,901 --> 01:23:50,459
<i>Thing is...</i>

1096
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:52,975
it can't look like a job.

1097
01:23:53,861 --> 01:23:56,294
<i>If Yitzchok gets hit, The Rabbi will go to war.</i>

1098
01:23:58,780 --> 01:24:03,012
So... I need you to make it look like
it ain't what it is.

1099
01:24:04,499 --> 01:24:06,615
<i>Can that be done?</i>

1100
01:24:06,699 --> 01:24:08,610
Anything can be done.

1101
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:13,054
Good. How?

1102
01:24:13,138 --> 01:24:15,209
Kansas City Shuffle.

1103
01:24:16,938 --> 01:24:18,815
I'm not familiar with the term.

1104
01:24:21,498 --> 01:24:23,568
I'll need to see Slim's books.

1105
01:24:23,658 --> 01:24:29,015
Slim's books were taken when he was hit,
but... I do keep copies.

1106
01:24:33,577 --> 01:24:35,693
What are you looking for?

1107
01:24:39,017 --> 01:24:41,577
This is our guy. Nick - 1729.

1108
01:24:42,216 --> 01:24:44,252
1729.

1109
01:24:44,336 --> 01:24:45,689
Nick Fisher.

1110
01:24:45,776 --> 01:24:46,845
Why him?

1111
01:24:47,936 --> 01:24:49,528
A loser.

1112
01:24:49,615 --> 01:24:51,811
Pick him up. Bring him here.

1113
01:25:00,015 --> 01:25:02,290
<i>GOODKAT: Still not talking to each other, huh?</i>

1114
01:25:02,374 --> 01:25:04,331
<i>Can't say that I blame you.</i>

1115
01:25:04,414 --> 01:25:06,484
- Why are you here?
- Big job.

1116
01:25:06,574 --> 01:25:09,532
I was under the impression
you no longer worked New York.

1117
01:25:09,614 --> 01:25:12,651
Like I said... very big job.

1118
01:25:12,734 --> 01:25:16,773
And you thought, as long as you're in town,
you'd drop by and see your old pal Schlomo,

1119
01:25:16,853 --> 01:25:19,526
and say, "Hello. How about them Yanks?"

1120
01:25:21,813 --> 01:25:23,769
No. But something like that.

1121
01:25:27,773 --> 01:25:30,606
Only problem is you and I aren't old friends.

1122
01:25:30,692 --> 01:25:32,125
And I hate baseball.

1123
01:25:32,212 --> 01:25:35,363
And since we're not friends and
you hate baseball, why the fuck are you here?

1124
01:25:35,452 --> 01:25:38,205
It's because we're not friends that I'm here.

1125
01:25:39,091 --> 01:25:42,687
Because if we had been friends,
I wouldn't have been hired to kill your son.

1126
01:25:42,771 --> 01:25:47,322
Because that is right at the top of my list
of things that friends do not do to their friends.

1127
01:25:47,411 --> 01:25:50,528
The good news for you is,
my friendship is for sale.

1128
01:25:51,290 --> 01:25:54,521
You see, it seems to me
that your son means more to you alive

1129
01:25:54,611 --> 01:25:56,521
than he does to The Boss dead.

1130
01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:58,760
And more money means more to me
than less money.

1131
01:25:58,850 --> 01:26:02,808
And you are the guy that sleeps with
all that green under your mattress.

1132
01:26:03,609 --> 01:26:05,123
I'm listening.

1133
01:26:05,210 --> 01:26:09,122
You will pay me double to kill The Boss
what The Boss was paying me to kill Yitzchok.

1134
01:26:09,209 --> 01:26:12,281
- Ohh.
- And that...

1135
01:26:14,009 --> 01:26:15,964
And that will make us friends.

1136
01:26:16,729 --> 01:26:18,684
Right, Rabbi?

1137
01:26:19,729 --> 01:26:21,047
Hm?

1138
01:26:25,008 --> 01:26:29,559
And... since friends do favors for their friends,
you will do a favor for me.

1139
01:26:29,647 --> 01:26:32,446
Pray tell? What is this favor?

1140
01:26:32,527 --> 01:26:35,917
Concerns a matter of debt collection.
One debt in particular.

1141
01:26:36,007 --> 01:26:37,122
Whose?

1142
01:26:37,207 --> 01:26:40,198
A flop. From Benny's book.
Goes by the name of Nick Fisher.

1143
01:26:40,287 --> 01:26:42,356
Who is he?

1144
01:26:42,446 --> 01:26:44,402
Just a loser.

1145
01:26:44,486 --> 01:26:46,442
You just made a lot of money.

1146
01:26:49,766 --> 01:26:52,838
<i>SLEVIN: And then I was free
to come and go as I pleased.</i>

1147
01:27:06,205 --> 01:27:07,001
Hm?

1148
01:27:07,084 --> 01:27:10,042
Whatever they're paying you...

1149
01:27:16,604 --> 01:27:17,957
Oh.

1150
01:27:18,843 --> 01:27:20,037
There is nobody.

1151
01:27:22,283 --> 01:27:24,239
I did this to you.

1152
01:27:27,122 --> 01:27:28,271
- Me.
- You.

1153
01:27:29,002 --> 01:27:30,721
Me.

1154
01:27:36,602 --> 01:27:38,558
Who are you?

1155
01:27:41,121 --> 01:27:43,033
<i>BRIKOWSKl: Who is he?</i>

1156
01:27:43,121 --> 01:27:47,273
Considering he no longer has fingerprints,
I'd say it's unlikely we'll ever know.

1157
01:27:47,361 --> 01:27:49,113
What about dental records?

1158
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:54,559
Sure, find the bottom half of the jaw, then all
we need to do is find out who the dentist was.

1159
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,316
What a fucking mess.

1160
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:00,915
<i>Hey, Brikowski, it's Marty, you there?</i>

1161
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,912
<i>We found two more bodies
to go along with the two you've already got.</i>

1162
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,955
All right, I'll be right over.

1163
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:11,191
Did you ever get a hold of The Rabbi so he can
get down here and identify what's left of his kid?

1164
01:28:11,279 --> 01:28:14,510
<i>Negative.
We've been calling for the last hour, no answer.</i>

1165
01:28:14,599 --> 01:28:16,032
Send somebody over.

1166
01:28:16,119 --> 01:28:17,268
<i>Copy.</i>

1167
01:28:19,198 --> 01:28:21,917
You all right? You look a little shook-up.

1168
01:28:21,998 --> 01:28:23,795
No, I'm fine.

1169
01:28:23,878 --> 01:28:25,834
All right.

1170
01:28:48,316 --> 01:28:51,387
<i>- Yeah.
- Hey, Brikowski, it's Murphy.</i>

1171
01:28:51,476 --> 01:28:52,989
Hey, Murph, what's up?

1172
01:28:53,075 --> 01:28:56,068
<i>Harry Kello came by today.
You remember Harry?</i>

1173
01:28:56,156 --> 01:28:59,864
He retired a few years ago. His wife just died,
so he comes in a couple of times a week,

1174
01:28:59,955 --> 01:29:01,911
talks shop, tells stories to the rooks.

1175
01:29:01,994 --> 01:29:05,544
Starts every sentence with, "The way
things used to be". Guy living in the past.

1176
01:29:05,635 --> 01:29:08,103
<i>- Yeah. Yeah, what about him?
- We're making small talk.</i>

1177
01:29:08,195 --> 01:29:11,664
Guy says he can't complain,
then all he does is fuckin' complain.

1178
01:29:11,754 --> 01:29:15,030
His dead wife, the leg he got shot in,
his crappy pension,

1179
01:29:15,114 --> 01:29:18,663
but then he stops when he sees the picture
Marty snapped of your kid.

1180
01:29:18,754 --> 01:29:22,428
Just stares at it.
I say, "What is it? You know the kid?"

1181
01:29:22,513 --> 01:29:25,152
Thing is, he ain't looking at the picture,
but at the name.

1182
01:29:25,233 --> 01:29:28,509
I've got it written at the bottom.
He knows that name: Slevin.

1183
01:29:47,751 --> 01:29:49,707
I have that same phone.

1184
01:30:01,670 --> 01:30:05,867
<i>About an hour later the phone rings, it's Harry,
talking like a goddamned machine gun,</i>

1185
01:30:05,950 --> 01:30:08,338
going on and on about a horse race back in '79.

1186
01:30:11,110 --> 01:30:13,065
<i>Aqueduct.</i>

1187
01:30:14,069 --> 01:30:16,218
Seven horse, tenth race - ring a bell?

1188
01:30:17,309 --> 01:30:19,264
<i>(Race start bell)</i>

1189
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:25,624
<i>It was a drug store handicap.</i>

1190
01:30:25,708 --> 01:30:29,586
<i>Big wind-up, around the time The Boss,
The Rabbi set up shop in New York,</i>

1191
01:30:29,668 --> 01:30:32,580
<i>before people started
waking up with knives in their backs.</i>

1192
01:30:32,668 --> 01:30:37,183
Anyway, he goes on about this local legend,
about this kid.

1193
01:30:37,267 --> 01:30:38,985
His name was Max.

1194
01:30:41,747 --> 01:30:45,375
<i>Max placed a bet with a bookie named Roth.</i>

1195
01:30:45,466 --> 01:30:47,616
Roth laid the bet off.

1196
01:30:47,707 --> 01:30:49,219
On you.

1197
01:30:58,305 --> 01:31:00,057
And you.

1198
01:31:06,665 --> 01:31:09,338
But when The Rabbi and The Boss
find out the fix is in,

1199
01:31:09,424 --> 01:31:11,380
they are the opposite of happy.

1200
01:31:11,464 --> 01:31:14,376
Word comes down an example is to be made.

1201
01:31:14,464 --> 01:31:15,214
Aargh!

1202
01:31:15,304 --> 01:31:17,534
These guys kill everyone!

1203
01:31:17,624 --> 01:31:18,818
<i>And I mean every one.</i>

1204
01:31:19,863 --> 01:31:23,015
<i>Max, his wife, his kid, Roth...</i>

1205
01:31:23,103 --> 01:31:24,934
<i>even the goddamned horse died.</i>

1206
01:31:25,023 --> 01:31:28,493
These guys went to town with a tomahawk.
It was a fucking massacre.

1207
01:31:30,142 --> 01:31:34,182
<i>They had to bring in a specialist to do the kid
cos nobody would take the job.</i>

1208
01:31:51,381 --> 01:31:53,575
What have you done with my son?

1209
01:32:09,219 --> 01:32:10,891
You?

1210
01:32:10,979 --> 01:32:12,970
No.

1211
01:32:13,059 --> 01:32:15,253
You're dead.

1212
01:32:16,739 --> 01:32:19,047
You're dead!

1213
01:32:25,018 --> 01:32:29,057
<i>So Harry's going on about how they had to
bring in a specialist to kill the kid,</i>

1214
01:32:29,138 --> 01:32:33,176
but I ain't seeing the connection,
so I says, "What has this to do with the case?"

1215
01:32:33,258 --> 01:32:35,213
<i>He says, "The horse's name."</i>

1216
01:32:35,297 --> 01:32:37,333
<i>I say, "What about the horse's name?"</i>

1217
01:32:37,417 --> 01:32:41,649
<i>He says the horse's name was
Lucky Number Slevin.</i>

1218
01:32:41,736 --> 01:32:43,648
- What is your name?
- Slevin Kelevra.

1219
01:32:52,496 --> 01:32:54,451
Do you remember this part?

1220
01:33:04,774 --> 01:33:07,653
Please! I have a family.

1221
01:33:07,735 --> 01:33:09,566
Not any more, you don't.

1222
01:33:09,654 --> 01:33:11,373
Henry! (Sobs)

1223
01:33:13,374 --> 01:33:15,330
You fucking bastards!

1224
01:33:16,973 --> 01:33:19,488
You fucking bastards!

1225
01:33:38,052 --> 01:33:40,520
The two of you killed everything I ever loved.

1226
01:33:46,531 --> 01:33:48,488
Fuck you both.

1227
01:34:11,929 --> 01:34:16,719
<i>Now, there is no such person as Slevin Kelevra,
as far as I can tell.</i>

1228
01:34:16,809 --> 01:34:18,959
<i>Which means the kid was using a pseudonym.</i>

1229
01:34:19,048 --> 01:34:21,961
<i>Which is interesting,
him picking the name of a dead racehorse</i>

1230
01:34:22,048 --> 01:34:24,278
and keeping company
with The Boss and The Rabbi,

1231
01:34:24,368 --> 01:34:27,485
seeing as they had some involvement
with that very horse.

1232
01:34:27,568 --> 01:34:30,128
<i>I thought to myself, maybe it means something.</i>

1233
01:34:30,208 --> 01:34:34,883
<i>Then again, maybe its just a coincidence,
name's gotta come from someplace - right?</i>

1234
01:34:34,967 --> 01:34:38,516
<i>I guess none of this really matters
now that the kid's gone cold.</i>

1235
01:34:43,326 --> 01:34:46,364
<i>Ah, one more thing,
we've got a new guy in the precinct.</i>

1236
01:34:47,087 --> 01:34:49,520
<i>Jewish fella, funny little guy, talks a lot.</i>

1237
01:34:50,966 --> 01:34:55,721
<i>Anyway, in case you're interested,
he says the name Kelevra is Hebrew.</i>

1238
01:34:55,805 --> 01:34:57,921
<i>He says it means...</i>

1239
01:34:58,005 --> 01:34:59,961
Bad dog.

1240
01:35:06,245 --> 01:35:08,804
<i>BRIKOWSKl:
20 years ago, he used to be my bookie.</i>

1241
01:35:08,885 --> 01:35:10,954
<i>I used to sign my pay cheques over to him.</i>

1242
01:35:26,483 --> 01:35:28,439
Brikowski? You there?

1243
01:37:18,274 --> 01:37:19,991
<i>Your girl made me.</i>

1244
01:37:21,714 --> 01:37:23,669
She took my picture.

1245
01:37:24,594 --> 01:37:26,549
She's got to go in the ground.

1246
01:37:28,793 --> 01:37:29,748
OK.

1247
01:37:50,431 --> 01:37:52,387
I have something I have to tell you.

1248
01:37:54,951 --> 01:37:56,907
He told me that we needed to kill you.

1249
01:38:02,070 --> 01:38:04,026
You're gonna have to trust me.

1250
01:38:15,030 --> 01:38:16,985
Shit!

1251
01:38:19,788 --> 01:38:21,745
He's going to shoot you here.

1252
01:39:16,904 --> 01:39:18,860
I didn't think you'd understand.

1253
01:39:35,783 --> 01:39:37,340
I understood.

1254
01:39:41,982 --> 01:39:43,937
How did you find out about us?

1255
01:39:44,022 --> 01:39:46,172
I'm a world-class assassin, fuckhead.

1256
01:39:46,261 --> 01:39:48,218
How do you think I found out?

1257
01:39:51,741 --> 01:39:53,572
I thought you might want this.

1258
01:40:31,778 --> 01:40:33,529
I want to go home.

1259
01:40:33,618 --> 01:40:35,893
Neither of us is going home for a long time, kid.

1260
01:40:39,577 --> 01:40:41,534
My name is Good Kat.

1261
01:40:42,577 --> 01:40:44,532
You can call me Mr. Good Kat.
