1
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:24,249
Mom...

2
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:49,842
I love you, Libby.

3
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:52,444
I love you, ladybug.

4
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,646
Don't you ever forget that.

5
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:26,612
Libby,
what you're about to tell us
is very, very important.

6
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:30,282
Did Ben kill your mom
and your sisters?

7
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,721
You were in the house
when it happened.

8
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:43,295
So tell us. It was Ben.
He killed them, right?

9
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,769
I have a meanness inside me.

10
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,572
Real as an organ.

11
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,608
It's the day blood.

12
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,744
Something's fuckin'
wrong with it.

13
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:03,849
I was eight the night they were
killed and suddenly I was famous.

14
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:08,220
The little orphan girl of the
Kansas prairie massacre.

15
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,825
So, strangers send me money.

16
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:16,261
Just enough for
me to do nothing.

17
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,497
Which was exactly what I did.

18
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,567
How much is left?

19
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:24,303
Do you read
the reports I send you?

20
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:27,406
Sometimes.

21
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,108
Have you at least
listened to my messages?

22
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,211
How much?

23
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:36,081
There is $482 and 12 cents
left in your fund.

24
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:38,217
Now as I have
mentioned before...

25
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,219
Jesus...

26
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,253
...had you been
able to replenish it

27
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:43,655
with any kind of
regular income,

28
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:45,524
we'd have been
able to keep it afloat.

29
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:47,646
You're also two months
behind on your rent.

30
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,535
What about the book? Hmm?

31
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:58,303
That should have
made more money.

32
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:00,339
- I know.
- Any new donations?

33
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:01,907
Thirtieth anniversary
is coming up...

34
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,610
- You know, I could...
- People have short attention spans, Libby.

35
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:08,113
And there's always
a new murder, I'm afraid.

36
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,048
They want to help
other little girls.

37
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,851
And the truth is, you're not
a little girl anymore.

38
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,930
I'm not ready for this.

39
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,100
But in a way,

40
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:31,370
it could turn out to be
a blessing in disguise.

41
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:36,208
And lead you into an exciting
new phase of your life.

42
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,779
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

43
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,115
Are you fucking kidding me?

44
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:55,861
In the past Jim Jeffries used to
hand me bulging shoe boxes full of mail.

45
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,798
Most of them letters
with checks inside.

46
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,336
In return,
donors would receive

47
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:07,773
a form letter in my blocky
handwriting that read...

48
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:10,108
"Thank you for your donation.

49
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:15,280
"It's people like you who let me
look forward to a brighter future.

50
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:17,916
"Yours truly, Libby day."

51
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,673
Hello?

52
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:42,941
Hello?

53
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,376
Is this Lyle wirth?

54
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:45,777
Yeah, who's asking?

55
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,149
It's Libby day, you wrote me.

56
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:54,653
Oh, holy cow! Really?
Libby day?

57
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:56,254
Are you in town?

58
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,857
What do you mean, which town?

59
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,560
Well, you're in Kansas City,
that's where you live, right?

60
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:04,429
Hello?

61
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,165
Hello?

62
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:11,002
Yeah, I live in Kansas City.

63
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:13,205
Listen, your offer,
is it serious?

64
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,912
Lyle wirth looked
like a serial killer.

65
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:23,215
Which probably meant
he wasn't one.

66
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:24,316
Lyle?

67
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,686
Libby?

68
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,740
Yeah, what?
You were expecting someone else?

69
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:35,494
Wow, Libby day.
I'm so excited to finally meet you...

70
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:37,162
Okay, just fucking relax.

71
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,134
There's, uh,
no reason to be scared.

72
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:44,035
I'm not scared of you.

73
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:45,804
I'm just trying to figure out
what kind of a person

74
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:49,074
wants to meet in a laundromat
in the middle of the fucking night.

75
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,543
Oh, no, it's not what you think.
I own this place.

76
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,645
I own two of them.
I'm an entrepreneur.

77
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,616
- Can I offer you something?
- Like what?

78
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:59,151
Detergent?

79
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:00,352
I was thinking
maybe a coffee...

80
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:02,888
- Just take a fucking step back, man!
- Sorry.

81
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,689
What is it with you
and personal space?

82
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:05,691
All right.

83
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,729
Tell me about this club.

84
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,965
You know how some guys
collect baseball cards?

85
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,901
Or women who read
gossip magazines

86
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:18,103
and know everything
about some celebrity.

87
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,405
Like their baby's name or
the town where they grew up?

88
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:23,275
This is like that,
only it's about murders.

89
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:25,977
We call it the kill club.

90
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,815
It's not as weird
as it sounds.

91
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,986
It's like a bunch of people who
like true crimes and mysteries.

92
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:37,722
You know, everyone has a case
that they are passionate about.

93
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:40,792
You and your family are very special.
Huge with the club.

94
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,797
I mean, it's a real
tragedy what happened.

95
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,233
Your brother in jail,
going on 28 years.

96
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:54,239
Look, if you
and your little club

97
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:57,008
want to convince me that Ben's innocent,
you're wasting your time.

98
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,412
Just come along, it's like...
Like a convention.

99
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,617
How much?

100
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:08,587
Five hundred dollars. And there
will be a lot of collectors there,

101
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:10,522
so bring any souvenirs
from your childhood...

102
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:11,524
I want a thousand.

103
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,559
I can give you 700.

104
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:17,001
And you let us pick your brain
about what happened that day.

105
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:24,836
Fine.

106
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,005
Yeah?

107
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,373
Yeah. Deal.

108
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,646
I betcha can't!

109
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,118
Come on, let's go!

110
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,394
Hey! What about breakfast?

111
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,659
It's a little warm out for that hat,
don't you think?

112
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:54,192
Settle down girls.
Settle down.

113
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,163
Hey, Ben.

114
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,766
- Hey, Libby.
- I like your salt mountain.

115
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:02,768
Oh, yeah?

116
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,507
Mom, Ben and Libby are making
a mess at the table.

117
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:10,675
Sweetie, it's fine.

118
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:12,110
Michelle, can you make sure
everyone has juice.

119
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:15,714
Mom! Libby took my
pancake off my plate.

120
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:17,382
Libby, Ben...

121
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:18,384
Eggs?

122
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:24,022
Mom,
Ben's wearing a hat inside.
It's not even cold. Duh!

123
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:26,458
Michelle, you're right.
Ben, you need to take off your hat.

124
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,540
It's not polite to wear
a hat at the table.

125
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,029
Ben.

126
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:42,173
Mom, Ben looks like some ghoul
from one of his metal band posters.

127
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:43,642
Why?

128
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,678
It's just hair, mom.
Don't freak out.

129
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,415
I'll be back later.

130
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:04,462
It wasn't the first time I'd been
offered money for conferences or meetings.

131
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:11,269
I'd been offered all sorts of
twisted deals over the years.

132
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,360
Want some sweets, little girl?

133
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,433
Libby!

134
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,170
- Welcome to our club.
- What?

135
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:46,738
I said, "welcome to our club!"

136
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,620
You want me to
show you around?

137
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,575
I want my money.

138
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,948
Come on.
I'll show you upstairs.

139
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,417
The kill club,

140
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:03,588
or "KC," as we call it, is basically
for solvers and fans of famous murders.

141
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,356
Everyone from
Fanny Adams to the killer...

142
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,192
Who's Fanny Adams?

143
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:10,562
She's an eight-year-old who got
chopped to bits in england back in 1867.

144
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:13,031
- That guy you passed with the sweets downstairs.
- Mmm-hmm.

145
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:16,201
He was playing the role of her murderer,
Frederick Baker.

146
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:20,638
Jesus Christ...

147
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,873
You guys need to get a life.

148
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,042
Yeah, we've been trying to
push the role players out,

149
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:26,277
but, too many guys
are into that.

150
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,713
Plus, it's a good
source of income for us.

151
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,782
- Us?
- The solvers.

152
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,551
We're a serious-minded
organization.

153
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:35,787
Among our ranks
are ex-cops,

154
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:37,956
private and insurance
investigators, lawyers.

155
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,325
We solve crimes.
It's what we do.

156
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:49,801
Lyle. Who's your young friend?

157
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:52,570
Bob bredella,
this is Libby day.

158
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:56,941
Whose, uh, family was at
the Kansas farm house massacre.

159
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:57,942
Oh...

160
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:02,714
if you had a cock you would
be in pieces in my garbage right now.

161
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:04,636
Parts that
I didn't use for chili.

162
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,719
Get your fucking hands
off me! You freak!

163
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:09,287
- I'm kidding. I'm sorry.
- You think that's funny?

164
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,129
- Only kidding.
- You fat fuck!

165
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,224
That wouldn't have been
the first fight at kill club,

166
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:14,993
but it would've
been the weirdest.

167
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:16,094
You know what, I'm outta here.

168
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:17,295
No, no, no. Libby, please.

169
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,730
I don't want to
do this anymore.

170
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:22,233
No, no.
I can understand why
you wouldn't like it so far.

171
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,903
Okay.
But we're not all like that.

172
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:27,806
Look, just give me a chance.
Look at this in here.

173
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,811
It's a bunch of pi's who think
they've identified a serial killer.

174
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,646
They're about to
catch some guy

175
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:35,880
who has been crossing states.

176
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:39,150
You know, Missouri, Kansas,
Oklahoma, to help kill people.

177
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,565
What do you mean, help?

178
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:42,954
They call him
the Angel of debt.

179
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:44,823
They think he's like
a Jack Kevorkian

180
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,291
for people with bad credit,

181
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:48,213
good life insurance
and no way out.

182
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,896
You'll like our group.
It's serious, no costumes.

183
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:58,303
Hi everyone. It's my honor
to present our special guest,

184
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:00,772
and the star
of this year's kill club.

185
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:01,973
Libby day.

186
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:07,512
Around 2:00 A.M.
on October the 13th, 1985,

187
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:12,584
a person or persons killed
three members of the day family

188
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:15,220
in their farm house
in Kinnakee, Kansas.

189
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:17,655
The youngest child, Libby,

190
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:21,359
escaped the killer through
a window in her mother's room.

191
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,963
The oldest child, Benjamin,
never produced an alibi

192
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:28,466
and was extremely
uncooperative with the police.

193
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,034
Libby testified,

194
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,570
she saw Ben
commit the murders.

195
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:35,740
Despite Libby's
confused testimony,

196
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:38,209
and young age,

197
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:42,113
and despite a startling lack
of physical evidence,

198
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,715
Ben day was convicted.

199
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:47,285
Based largely on rumors that
he was involved in devil worship.

200
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,555
You done?

201
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,724
I think the general
consensus is that runner day,

202
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,125
her father, did it.

203
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:56,694
I mean, he goes to Patty,
tries to bully her for money,

204
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:58,630
as usual gets nothing,
and he goes haywire.

205
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:00,164
I mean, the guy
was crazy, right?

206
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,133
Right. I don't know...

207
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,803
Look, I didn't know him,
he left when I was, like, two.

208
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:07,372
- Where is he now?
- I don't know.

209
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:09,641
There was a blood stain
on Michelle's bed sheets.

210
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:11,576
Different blood type
than anyone in the family.

211
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,445
But since the sheets
were from goodwill,

212
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,714
prosecutor says that blood
could have come from anywhere.

213
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:18,149
Yeah, we were poor.

214
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,951
A lot of our shit
came from goodwill, okay?

215
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:22,754
Do you remember anything
out of the ordinary

216
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,455
- happening that day?
- Like what?

217
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:27,692
Like, how your mother reacted
to the Krissi cates scandal.

218
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:30,094
- Who?
- Krissi cates.

219
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:32,797
I don't know who that is.

220
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,399
You mentioned
her in your book.

221
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:37,335
I didn't write that book.
I didn't even read it.

222
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:39,137
What about Trey Teepano?

223
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:41,773
What about Ben day?
You want to hear
what I have to say about him?

224
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,742
Please, this is the grossest
miscarriage of justice ever.

225
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,144
What is this woman's deal?

226
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,279
Magda here is very involved in
the effort to free your brother.

227
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,616
He's a wonderful man.
He draws, he writes poetry.

228
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:54,485
You should get to know him, Libby.
You really should.

229
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:57,021
In three weeks,
that window is going to close.

230
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:58,690
What?

231
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:00,091
In order to solve this crime,

232
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,995
we need to compile
new evidence and

233
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:06,431
if you were inclined,
you could recant your testimony

234
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:11,002
when we file for habeas corpus.
But time is of the essence.

235
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,503
What are you talking about?

236
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:14,138
Oh, because of budget cuts,

237
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,474
they are consolidating departments
and disposing of evidence

238
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,356
from cases
older than 10 years.

239
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,980
Which means,
in three weeks' time,
Ben's file will be shredded.

240
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,385
You're just a few people

241
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:29,787
who like murder
mysteries and true crimes...

242
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,589
Libby. Ben is innocent
and we're trying to prove it.

243
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,524
He's never even
filed for an appeal!

244
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:37,495
He's had reason enough for
eight appeals but he has lost hope.

245
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,497
Good.

246
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,832
- Please help...
- No.

247
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:43,601
- It's not a conspiracy theory...
- Hey, don't be like that!

248
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:44,669
Get your hands off me!

249
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,504
At least stay and
try and convince us.

250
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,307
I told you she wouldn't
bother, lazy little liar.

251
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:55,046
Yes, that's what you are and
what you've always been.
A liar!

252
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,089
You don't know shit about
what happened that night.

253
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:10,895
None of you.

254
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,900
Run! Run!

255
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,735
No!

256
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,041
Libby! Libby!

257
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,746
Libby!

258
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,068
They're all dead!

259
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:25,369
"Once I was in art class
and met a boy named Ben.

260
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:28,039
"It was his heart
I knew I would win.

261
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:31,242
"He has big blue eyes
and really nice skin.

262
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:32,710
"Are you 'in'?"

263
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,982
"it's Saturday and I'm thinking of you.
Guess who?"

264
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,319
Hey, do you know someone here?

265
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:11,449
Him.

266
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,219
Hey. Hey.

267
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:16,888
Hey, do you know this kid?

268
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,192
No, I don't hang out
with middle-schoolers.

269
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:22,293
Fuck off.

270
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:23,661
Oh, little guy's pissed.

271
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,130
Okay, dude, what's up?
Do I know you or what?

272
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:27,732
I'm a friend of Trey's,
I come here all the time.

273
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:30,768
You liar. That crazy Indian
doesn't have any friends.

274
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,938
Is he even really Indian?
He looks Asian to me.

275
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,673
I think he's,
uh, what do they call it,

276
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,175
like, a mixed blood. He's like
two different things.

277
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,677
So, like, his drunken granddad
raped a Chinese whore?

278
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,312
You better watch your mouth,

279
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:43,194
Trey's into
some scary ass shit.

280
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,515
Satanic shit.

281
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,386
Yeah, we get into some
pretty dark shit sometimes.

282
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:50,508
You're one of the guys
that killed the cows?

283
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,158
We have to.

284
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,327
It's an order.

285
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:59,297
Bro, that's a weird order.
That was my hamburger.

286
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,366
Look at his face.

287
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,436
Sometimes things have to die.
We have to kill them.

288
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:11,642
Just like Jesus requires
sacrifice, so does Satan.

289
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,330
Mom, is Ben in trouble?

290
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:34,398
No, sweetie, Ben's fine.

291
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,520
- Are you sure?
- Michelle, what do you want?

292
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,569
I heard rumors.

293
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,238
What kind of rumors?

294
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,075
Mom, there's a car coming!

295
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,145
Who is it?

296
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,114
Morning.

297
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:56,821
Thank you.

298
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,327
Who's the little spy?

299
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:05,196
That's Libby.

300
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,593
She's got big blue eyes
like her mom.

301
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:12,003
Where are your people
from originally? Ireland?

302
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,139
Germany.
My maiden name was Krause.

303
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:17,108
There was another
German farmer near Ark city.

304
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,510
Last summer,
his hopper went screwy

305
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:22,546
and dumped 4000 pounds
of wheat on him.

306
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:23,848
Poor fellow drowned in it.

307
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,983
He suffocated before
they could get to him.

308
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,552
- I know the story.
- His farm's going under.

309
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:34,091
He owed us, uh, I mean,
the fha a lot of money.

310
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,459
Why you working on a Saturday, Joseph,
is something wrong?

311
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:42,233
They're going to foreclose.

312
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:44,502
Why now?

313
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,871
Prices aren't
what they used to be.

314
00:21:46,873 --> 00:21:48,105
A strong harvest
is what brought

315
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:50,041
those prices down,
that could change next year.

316
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:52,743
There's no way for
you to come out on top.

317
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:55,046
I could sell the animals,
I'll sell some of the machinery.

318
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:56,514
The animals aren't worth much.

319
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:58,916
You already sold
most of the machinery.

320
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,620
There's got to be a way.

321
00:22:02,622 --> 00:22:05,890
- Banks said they would back...
- Your bank's going under, too.

322
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,759
I'm sorry.

323
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:10,761
They're just
trying to get rid of us.

324
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,731
I'm not sure who "they" are.

325
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,701
The only way to
fix this is money.

326
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:19,403
I'm talking beg,

327
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:21,439
borrow, steal.

328
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:23,974
Time for pride is over, Patty.

329
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:30,681
Libby?
What you're about to tell us
is very, very important.

330
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:35,586
Did Ben kill your mom
and your sisters?

331
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:43,394
You were in the house
when it happened, so tell us.

332
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:47,365
It was Ben,
he killed them, right?

333
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:03,881
Listen, I've been thinking.

334
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,917
If I were to look
into this case some more,

335
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:09,200
is that something your club
would be able to finance?

336
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:10,721
You changed your mind?

337
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,004
No, as far as I'm concerned
Ben is the killer, but...

338
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,727
I need money.

339
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:20,698
I'm willing to offer
your club three weeks
of my life in exchange.

340
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:24,702
That doesn't sound very noble.

341
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:27,204
- Whatever.
- No, wait. Libby. Libby.

342
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,520
Do you really have
no contact with runner?

343
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:32,476
No.

344
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:34,211
Well, it might be a good idea
to track him down.

345
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:36,453
Although, personally
I don't think runner did it.

346
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:38,949
What's your theory?

347
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:40,951
I'm not quite ready
to share that yet.

348
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:44,288
Oh, come on!
If Ben is so innocent,
why doesn't he try to get out?

349
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,970
Maybe you should
go talk to him.

350
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,325
No.

351
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:49,894
We start with
other people first.

352
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:51,228
What is it?
Is it a money thing?

353
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,270
I just don't like
wasting my time, okay?

354
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:54,799
Okay.

355
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:57,168
How about... $300?

356
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,739
Where do you get this money?

357
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:04,175
As treasurer,
I have a certain amount
of discretionary funds.

358
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,710
This is the project
I choose to use them for.

359
00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:09,547
What? What's so funny?

360
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,552
You're a noble embezzler.
That's what's funny.

361
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:17,755
- That makes you almost likable.
- Thanks.

362
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:20,357
I need 500 more. An advance.

363
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:21,859
Why?

364
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:23,941
'Cause I got to get
my car out of the shop.

365
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:26,195
It's been held hostage
for the last six months.

366
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,266
I'm going to need a car.

367
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:33,804
All right.

368
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:40,277
- You better play ball.
- Yeah, yeah, I will.

369
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:41,378
Go see Ben.

370
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:43,214
It all starts with him.

371
00:24:43,216 --> 00:24:45,256
No, it all ends with him.
He killed them.

372
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:48,385
I'm serious,
Libby, go talk to him...

373
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:49,720
Fine! I'll talk to him!

374
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,590
Just to prove
you freaks wrong.

375
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:54,925
Make that fat bitch magda cry.

376
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,716
I think...

377
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:23,287
I saw Ben as I was standing
at the door of my mom's room.

378
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:27,091
He was threatening
her with our shotgun.

379
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:06,597
Satan encourages you
to do what feels good.

380
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:08,559
Because we're all
basically animals.

381
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:12,303
Settle down. Quiet.

382
00:26:12,305 --> 00:26:15,973
Benjamin, you do understand
this is very serious, don't you?

383
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,290
Hi, Libby.

384
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:34,292
Hey, Ben.

385
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,061
I never thought
I'd see you here.

386
00:26:37,063 --> 00:26:39,063
Yeah well,
I never thought I'd come.

387
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:41,832
Turns out you got
a couple of fans outside.

388
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:44,501
People who take you
for the victim, well played.

389
00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:46,670
I thought about you
a lot over the years.

390
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,541
Every once in a while,
someone tells me about you

391
00:26:50,543 --> 00:26:52,009
but it's not the same.

392
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,946
How's it in there?

393
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:59,783
I'm fine. Really, I am.
I have my high school diploma.

394
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:02,920
I'm even part way to
a college degree. English.

395
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,556
I read fucking
Shakespeare now.

396
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:11,595
Good for you.

397
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:17,747
Man, Libby,
you're so beautiful.

398
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:19,837
You've got mom's eyes.

399
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:21,839
You must hear
that all the time.

400
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,742
Who would tell me that?

401
00:27:24,744 --> 00:27:27,811
Runner's gone,
don't know where.

402
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:28,813
Diane's dead.

403
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:30,514
There's no one.

404
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:32,583
That's not good.
They should've taken better care of you.

405
00:27:32,585 --> 00:27:36,086
You're born again? Hmm?

406
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:38,422
You found Jesus in there?
Why are you being so nice to me?

407
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:39,723
I'm not that nice, Libby.

408
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:41,458
I got a lot of anger
for a lot of people.

409
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,594
Just, you're not one of them.

410
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,034
What?

411
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:56,807
You're different.

412
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:58,729
You're different
than I imagined.

413
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:03,147
You know, we don't
have to stay in this room.

414
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:05,282
This room is designated
for death row inmates.

415
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:07,017
We can be in an open room.

416
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:12,256
Unless you requested this one?

417
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,499
Remember that horse, yellow?

418
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:24,034
Yellow?

419
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:27,171
The famous horse that
refused to be ridden?

420
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:29,206
- What, did he bite you?
- Nothing that dramatic.

421
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,708
Just thought I had
a good hold of him,

422
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,142
he threw me against the fence

423
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:34,211
and slammed my hand
against a nail.

424
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:36,914
Runner been in here?

425
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:39,383
You know where he is?

426
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,985
The last letter came care of

427
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:44,755
Bert Nolan's group home
for men somewhere in Oklahoma.

428
00:28:44,757 --> 00:28:47,658
He asked me for $500
to carry on his research

429
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,661
on my behalf. Good ol' runner.

430
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:53,397
What's the tat on your arm?

431
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:56,500
Oh, it's a old flame.

432
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:00,237
We started out as pen pals.

433
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,509
I thought I loved her.
Thought we'd get married.

434
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:08,604
How about you?
You got a boyfriend?

435
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:11,949
Don't do that.

436
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:16,520
How dare you?
You don't get to do that.

437
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,655
Libby, I'm...

438
00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:21,391
No, you don't get to ask me
fucking questions.

439
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,063
I mean, here comes
my little sister

440
00:29:26,065 --> 00:29:28,465
after all these years.
And I'm thinking,

441
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:30,734
"maybe this one
thing will work out."

442
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:33,429
Maybe I won't be
so fucking lonely.

443
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:36,607
We can talk about
a goddamn horse,

444
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:37,941
that's all I'm asking for,

445
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,783
something
just as tiny as that.

446
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:41,745
I don't remember the horse.

447
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:43,380
Yellow?

448
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:46,583
It was a dirty old farm horse.
But it was your horse.

449
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:47,818
How come I can't remember him?

450
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,220
You were pretty young
when mom had to sell him.

451
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:53,123
Broke her heart,
but she needed the money.

452
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,792
I can tell you all about him.

453
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,601
Go ahead, ask the question.

454
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:10,073
I don't need to ask.
I know you killed them.

455
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:11,141
No, I did not.

456
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:14,678
Of course not, I was a teenage
boy in a house full of girls.

457
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,714
At school I was the kid
that nobody paid attention to.

458
00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:19,616
In that court room,
people were scared of me.

459
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:21,051
I was a bad ass.

460
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:23,020
A bad ass
who killed his family.

461
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:24,121
Libby, I was a fool,

462
00:30:24,123 --> 00:30:27,291
but I did not kill mom
or debby or Michelle.

463
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,860
Then why have you
never filed for an appeal?

464
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:32,362
Hmm?

465
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:35,499
You like it so much in there,
you want to stay there?

466
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:40,003
You know what I think?
I think you're full of shit.

467
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:31,421
You look awesome. Told ya.

468
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,599
You don't think I might
be too old for you, huh?

469
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:47,237
Means that 17 might just
be too old for your taste.

470
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,540
Come on.

471
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:08,525
Come on, Ben.
Focus on me.
Come on, baby.

472
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,827
Is that all you got?

473
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,943
You know, I saw a couple
of friends today at the mall.

474
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:29,780
You know a little girl
named Krissi cates?

475
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,285
Um, yeah.

476
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:38,527
She's in that art class I've been
helping out with after school. Why?

477
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,925
You never told me
about no art class, Ben.

478
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:45,562
Yeah, well, I'm just
helping kids.

479
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:47,531
One of my
old teachers asked me to.

480
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:53,203
Well, they say the police
are looking for ya.

481
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:56,340
They say you did some naughty
things to some little girls.

482
00:32:56,342 --> 00:32:58,182
Everyone's calling you
a perv.

483
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:00,711
What are you talking about?

484
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:04,314
I love you.

485
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,984
Shh...

486
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,257
The baby's kicking.

487
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:30,273
It's aunt Diane!

488
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:33,143
There are more bags
in the car,

489
00:33:33,145 --> 00:33:35,065
with some surprises!
Go get them.

490
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:41,718
- You shouldn't have.
- It's what I do.

491
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,186
Are you okay?

492
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:46,256
The wolves are at the door.

493
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:54,231
That's too much.

494
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,435
I love the land.

495
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,306
It's like loving your kids.

496
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:05,976
I know you probably
don't know what I mean,

497
00:34:05,978 --> 00:34:07,898
but it's this
overwhelming feeling.

498
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,717
Watching it grow
and produce. And reproduce.

499
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,621
But you can only work
so many hours a day,

500
00:34:17,623 --> 00:34:19,956
and so many
days a week, Patty.

501
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:23,326
All by yourself,
you never stood a chance.

502
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:25,395
You should have done
like me and left this place.

503
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,164
You should have gone
to college, you're the brains.

504
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:28,498
It's mom and dad's farm.

505
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,533
I know.

506
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:34,704
It's time to let it go.
I don't see Ben.

507
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,175
He left early this morning.

508
00:34:38,177 --> 00:34:39,709
How are things with him?

509
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:43,647
Difficult.

510
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:44,649
Where is he?

511
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:49,152
I don't know, why?

512
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,756
So what do you think,
is it a boy or a girl?

513
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,667
I don't know.
How would I know?

514
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,030
Oh, so you're
saying you don't care.

515
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,999
- No, I do care.
- Mmm-hmm.

516
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:05,602
I was actually thinking of
some names if it's a girl.

517
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,104
Well, do you care to share?

518
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:08,505
Mmm, not yet.

519
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:13,777
Are you sure Michelle
hasn't found out?

520
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,313
She hasn't said anything.

521
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:18,849
That little weasel.

522
00:35:18,851 --> 00:35:20,784
You know, I swear if I ever
get my hands on her...

523
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,119
Shut up.

524
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:26,056
You know I've promised
my dad, Ben.

525
00:35:26,058 --> 00:35:29,538
He said if he ever found out I wasn't a
virgin anymore he'd shoot me in the head.

526
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,031
So you tell your
nosy little sister

527
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:37,033
to stop talking shit
about me at school.

528
00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:39,402
Before he finds out.

529
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:40,704
Hey, it's Trey!

530
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:42,639
Quit fucking around
and get out of there.

531
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:43,807
You don't know him, Ben.

532
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,769
You don't know
what he's capable of.

533
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:55,652
You know,
I think we should leave town
before our parents get back.

534
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,154
Okay.

535
00:35:57,288 --> 00:36:00,290
Really? That easy.

536
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:02,972
- What?
- How are you going to support us?

537
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:09,099
You'll have to get a job or...

538
00:36:09,101 --> 00:36:11,067
I don't know,
ask runner for money.

539
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:12,602
Runner? My dad?

540
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:14,137
Yeah. He makes money, right?

541
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:31,288
He does handyman stuff,
for work, labor...

542
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:33,256
- He works on farms.
- Are you kidding?

543
00:36:33,258 --> 00:36:35,138
Well, yeah,
what did you expect?

544
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:38,261
Trey! Ben doesn't
know about his dad!

545
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,067
You sorry sack of shit.

546
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:48,071
You don't know about your dad?
What the fuck, dude?

547
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,975
Hey, Ben.
You're smoking your
dad's weed, buddy.

548
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:53,883
What are you guys
talking about?

549
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:56,947
It's crap and he overcharges.
Said he got it in Texas.

550
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,615
Let's go find runner, honey.

551
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,352
So we can get some money.
Get the hell out of here.

552
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:05,021
Teenagers across
America are playing

553
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:07,190
with a new and
frightening game.

554
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:08,391
Satanism.

555
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,527
Their school books are marked
up by satanic symbols.

556
00:37:10,529 --> 00:37:12,796
They are seduced
by heavy metal heroes,

557
00:37:12,798 --> 00:37:14,698
many of whom
feature satanic imagery

558
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,267
in their songs
and album covers.

559
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:19,836
The fixation on violence,
evil and death

560
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:22,072
leads them to commit
abominable crimes,

561
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:25,609
including human sacrifice and
sexual abuse of children.

562
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:27,877
We're in the very throes
of a new satanic age...

563
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:31,381
Everyone at the time.
Police, judges, the psychiatric community,

564
00:37:31,383 --> 00:37:33,083
they were seeing
satanists everywhere.

565
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:34,417
And there weren't?

566
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,953
A few lost,
frustrated kids take
those lyrics too literally?

567
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:39,589
Yes,
but real criminal satanists?

568
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:42,125
What did
the investigation say?

569
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:43,793
The crime scene
was contaminated.

570
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:45,595
People traipsing in and out
of the house all day

571
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:48,231
was against all the rules of police
procedure, but no one cared.

572
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:49,666
They had the perfect culprit,

573
00:37:49,668 --> 00:37:52,068
a strange teenage boy that
no one in town liked much

574
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,671
and listened to heavy metal.
You know, it was convenient.

575
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,142
I've got the files so
you can take a look.

576
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:04,814
Libby, it's not a request.
It's part of the job.

577
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:07,851
Seriously? it's like
you guys want Ben out

578
00:38:07,853 --> 00:38:09,919
more than he does.
It's ridiculous.

579
00:38:09,921 --> 00:38:11,054
What did you think of him?

580
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:12,756
I don't know, Lyle.

581
00:38:12,758 --> 00:38:15,659
Did you ever hear about him
with his serious girlfriend?

582
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:19,396
Molly or Polly?
Something like that.

583
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:21,665
No. it doesn't ring a bell.

584
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,602
It's probably nothing.

585
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:27,203
He had a tattoo
of it on his arm.

586
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:28,972
It's probably another magda.

587
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:32,375
Will you just tell me?

588
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:35,779
Just tell me,
who do you think did it?

589
00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:38,648
I think Lou cates did it.

590
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,216
Krissi cates' father.

591
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:42,218
Found out he had
a history of violence,

592
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,180
went to jail for
aggravated battery.

593
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:49,172
You still have no idea
who Krissi cates is, do you?

594
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,393
No.

595
00:38:50,395 --> 00:38:51,861
Libby...

596
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:54,664
Come on,
I know you hate doing this,
but could you try?

597
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:58,301
You're stuck with us anyway,
just try. You're smart,

598
00:38:58,303 --> 00:39:01,504
you'll see for yourself that
something's not right. Just...

599
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,406
Just take a look
at the folder.

600
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,810
Come on, you'll see. Please.

601
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:18,121
Since I was seven
I'd only seen flashes of Ben.

602
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:21,524
Like some evil entity
in a haunted house.

603
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:27,897
But I'd forgotten there
was once just Ben.

604
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:29,766
My brother.

605
00:39:29,768 --> 00:39:32,435
Shy. Serious.

606
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:37,073
Couldn't have done
what they said.

607
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:38,508
What I said.

608
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:47,684
The molestation of Krissi cates
and the murders weren't legally linked.

609
00:39:47,686 --> 00:39:51,788
But everyone had heard the rumors and the
jury was surely poisoned against him.

610
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:54,591
Oddly,

611
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:58,828
all the little girls backed down and the
cates family never pressed charges.

612
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:05,335
The kill club found Krissi cates
mother in emporia, Kansas.

613
00:40:05,337 --> 00:40:07,771
But she'd never returned
their calls.

614
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:14,177
You never leave a message for
someone you really want to reach.

615
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:19,048
You keep calling and calling
until somebody picks up.

616
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:24,621
Out of anger, curiosity
or just fear.

617
00:40:24,623 --> 00:40:26,022
Hello?

618
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:29,559
Hello?

619
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:32,429
I'm so sorry,
did I just wake you up?

620
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:34,330
I didn't realize
how late it was.

621
00:40:34,332 --> 00:40:36,199
I can call back later.

622
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:37,634
Who is this?

623
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:42,605
My name is Stephanie Adams,
I'm an old friend of Krissi's,

624
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,241
- I was just looking for her...
- Christ! You people won't stop calling

625
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:46,676
until I give you
what you want, right?

626
00:40:46,678 --> 00:40:48,912
I have no idea what
you're talking about, ma'am.

627
00:40:48,914 --> 00:40:50,680
I'm just an old friend
looking for her,

628
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:52,602
I thought maybe
you could help me.

629
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:56,519
What was your name? Sally?

630
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:58,688
Yeah, my name is Sally Adams.

631
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,223
Listen, Sally,

632
00:41:00,225 --> 00:41:03,359
I've remarried and
I have very little contact
with my previous family.

633
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:04,894
Got it.

634
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:09,065
You don't by chance have a number
for Lou or know where I can find him?

635
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:15,738
Lou would be in some bar
in Kansas, I'd guess.

636
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:21,578
As for Krissi, drive west on I-70.
Just past Columbia.

637
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,914
Take a left into
the giant strip club.

638
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:26,516
You'll find her.

639
00:41:26,518 --> 00:41:28,184
Don't call again.

640
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,668
Mrs. day. I've called
you down to the precinct

641
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,238
due to some serious
allegations about your son.

642
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,907
How's he regarded in school?
Is he a popular kid?

643
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:53,022
He has lots of friends.

644
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:56,379
From what we understand,
he's a bit of a loner.

645
00:41:56,381 --> 00:41:57,501
So what does that prove?

646
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:00,350
You have four children,
correct?

647
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:01,451
Yes.

648
00:42:01,453 --> 00:42:02,552
Same father?

649
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:03,953
Yes.

650
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:07,924
Mrs. day,

651
00:42:07,926 --> 00:42:12,962
we've got four little girls who say that
Ben touched them in their private areas.

652
00:42:12,964 --> 00:42:16,399
That he took them to some farm
and performed certain...

653
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:21,204
...acts associated with
ritualistic devil worship.

654
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:26,376
Some farm?
Ben doesn't even have a car.

655
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:27,378
You don't know Ben.

656
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:34,684
Satanic worship
is not uncommon.

657
00:42:34,686 --> 00:42:37,253
It's made its way into
all areas of the community,

658
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:41,057
and part of their rituals involve
the degradation of children.

659
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:43,026
Do you have any evidence?
Any witnesses?

660
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:44,727
Besides some
12-year-old girls...

661
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:47,096
We got the note Ben left
in Krissi cates' locker.

662
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,400
We need to speak to a lawyer.

663
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:54,470
You do realize that abuse
usually starts at home.

664
00:42:54,472 --> 00:43:00,376
Mrs. day,
with three little girls,

665
00:43:00,378 --> 00:43:03,338
if I were you,
I'd want the truth out more than anyone.

666
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:10,987
- Mrs. cates?
- Yes?

667
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:13,923
I'm Patty day.
Ben day's mother.

668
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,695
It's Ben day's mother.

669
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:23,566
Can you take
these and show me

670
00:43:23,568 --> 00:43:25,268
exactly what happened?

671
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,509
Thank you.

672
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:39,282
Krissi?

673
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:42,585
Krissi, I'm Patty day.

674
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,021
I'm Ben's mom.

675
00:43:47,192 --> 00:43:48,391
I don't want her here.

676
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:51,494
- I don't want her here! You promised!
- Okay. Okay.

677
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:53,596
We're not safe!

678
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:56,199
We've heard about you.

679
00:43:56,201 --> 00:43:58,101
Got four kids at home,
can't afford one of them!

680
00:43:58,103 --> 00:44:00,837
Their daddy's a drunk,
if not worse.

681
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:02,538
You're on welfare!

682
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,408
Your meals come from
a food bank and Jesus Christ,

683
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:07,510
you've let your son do this!

684
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:11,114
I hope you're not hiding him.
Police are looking for him.

685
00:44:11,116 --> 00:44:12,749
I'm trying to
find him, I swear.

686
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:14,484
Ben is going to hell!

687
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:29,165
Krissi?

688
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:31,834
Yeah?

689
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:34,137
- Do you have time for a little chat?
- About what?

690
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:36,572
To be frank,
it's about Ben day.

691
00:44:36,574 --> 00:44:38,474
- Buy me a drink.
- Sure.

692
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:44,681
Who's this?

693
00:44:44,683 --> 00:44:48,618
This is Libby. She's with me.
What can I get you?

694
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:51,287
Vodka cranberry, double.

695
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:52,588
Make it two.

696
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:55,725
So... Ben day, hmm?

697
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:58,094
He really fucked up my life.

698
00:44:59,496 --> 00:45:01,496
You maintain you
were molested by him?

699
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,869
I was 11 and he was 16.

700
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,531
He started hanging around
with me after school.

701
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,274
I got that a lot.

702
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:13,843
I was a cute kid.
And we had lots of money.

703
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:15,445
Go on.

704
00:45:15,447 --> 00:45:17,680
He would take me
into the closet

705
00:45:17,682 --> 00:45:20,016
and make me
perform oral sex on him

706
00:45:20,018 --> 00:45:22,351
while making me
pledge allegiance to Satan.

707
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,420
Hey, baby,
let me get a bag of chips.

708
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:29,058
You don't mind, do you?

709
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:32,528
Anyway, Ben was
pretty sneaky with me.

710
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:34,664
I mean,
he had an altar in there.

711
00:45:34,666 --> 00:45:37,700
Upside-down cross.
Some dead animals.

712
00:45:37,702 --> 00:45:39,135
Sacrificed things.

713
00:45:39,137 --> 00:45:41,971
That's why I thought that he was
working his way up to killing me,

714
00:45:41,973 --> 00:45:43,853
but he killed
his family instead.

715
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:46,141
His whole family
was devil worshiping.

716
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:48,544
Um...

717
00:45:48,546 --> 00:45:52,148
How did your dad react when
you told him what Ben had done to you?

718
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:54,884
God, he was so over-protective.
He went totally ballistic.

719
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,720
Sometimes I think,
had my dad had found Ben,

720
00:45:57,722 --> 00:46:00,356
he would have killed him and
Ben's family would still be alive.

721
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:01,858
Your dad live around here?

722
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:03,760
No, we lost touch.

723
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:06,896
Hey, can you lend me 20 bucks?

724
00:46:06,898 --> 00:46:08,164
Can we get your dad's address?

725
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:10,433
I just told you.
That we're out of touch.

726
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:12,668
- Yeah, I know, but I'm sure there's a way...
- Lyle.

727
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:14,170
Take care of the check.

728
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:18,407
How much did you say?

729
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:22,745
You know what, make it 50.
I'll totally pay you back.

730
00:46:22,747 --> 00:46:27,150
I'll give you a pen,
you can write down your name and address.

731
00:46:28,753 --> 00:46:29,753
Here.

732
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,223
Libby day.

733
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:38,461
My name is Libby day
you lying whore.

734
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:39,762
Don't lose that.

735
00:46:46,104 --> 00:46:47,537
Burt Nolan home.

736
00:46:47,539 --> 00:46:52,942
Hey, I was looking a runner, or a Ronald day.
Is he staying with you?

737
00:46:52,944 --> 00:46:57,413
Well, he's been in and out.
But I'd be happy to give him a message.

738
00:46:57,415 --> 00:47:00,316
Could you ask him to call me back?
My name's Libby day.

739
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:02,218
It's kind of important.

740
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:07,990
Would you tell him I need to talk to him
about Ben and what happened that night?

741
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:11,561
Ben and that night. Okay.

742
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,232
That night.

743
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,491
That night.

744
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:46,662
I'd been a sleepwalker
since I could walk.

745
00:47:46,664 --> 00:47:50,032
My mom usually didn't move
when I got in bed with her.

746
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:55,872
But, that night,
she turned to me and told me she loved me.

747
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:59,475
She hardly ever told us
she loved us.

748
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:04,580
That's why I remember it.

749
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:16,058
I can't dwell
on these thoughts.

750
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:20,596
I've labeled these memories as if they
were a particularly dangerous region.

751
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:23,599
Dark place.

752
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:40,583
Michelle's diary.

753
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:45,121
I'd forgotten what a rotten
busy-body Michelle was.

754
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:50,226
In her last pages,
she kept writing about Ben's girlfriend, Diondra,

755
00:48:50,228 --> 00:48:51,794
as an evil whore.

756
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:11,314
I don't ever remember Ben
ever having a girlfriend.

757
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:27,129
Diondra Wertzner.

758
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:45,648
I'm a bad mother.

759
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:48,617
What are you talking about?

760
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:50,699
You're superwoman
as far as I'm concerned.

761
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,556
You keep the farm going,
you raise four kids,

762
00:49:53,558 --> 00:49:54,890
get them to school every day

763
00:49:54,892 --> 00:49:56,993
and you don't drink
a gallon of bourbon to do it.

764
00:49:56,995 --> 00:49:58,661
No, that cop was right.

765
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:02,498
If things weren't bad at home,

766
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,420
Ben wouldn't be
in so much trouble.

767
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:11,107
Fundamentally he's a good boy.

768
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:20,549
Sometimes I think it'd be
better if I disappeared.

769
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:21,650
Oh, yeah?

770
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:23,352
And what about the kids?

771
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:25,187
They could go with you.

772
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:29,358
They'd be better off
in Kansas City.

773
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:35,865
Father's a nut job
and I'm a failure.

774
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:47,309
That's runner's new car.

775
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:53,983
Do you want me
to come in with you?

776
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:56,018
No, I'll be okay.

777
00:50:56,987 --> 00:51:00,022
Mommy! Daddy's here!

778
00:51:00,024 --> 00:51:02,491
And he brought doughnuts!

779
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:10,900
Nothing concentrates
the attention more

780
00:51:10,902 --> 00:51:12,742
than an animal
that can kill you.

781
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,372
Girls, you know
you're not supposed

782
00:51:16,374 --> 00:51:17,706
to let anyone in the house
when I'm away.

783
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:20,309
- But, mom, it's daddy.
- And now daddy needs to leave.

784
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:21,311
Come on!

785
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:23,712
Let's talk!

786
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:30,853
I'm in no mood, runner.

787
00:51:30,855 --> 00:51:33,756
Vern evelee told me.
You just sold the tiller.

788
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:36,992
Yeah, and that money's gone.

789
00:51:36,994 --> 00:51:39,862
That money is gone as quick as I get it.
You should know that.

790
00:51:39,864 --> 00:51:41,764
You're never as
broke as you say.

791
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:47,736
I just need enough cash
to get to Texas.

792
00:51:47,738 --> 00:51:48,971
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

793
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,240
Patty, I'm in a real jam here.

794
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:53,742
This is life or death stuff.

795
00:51:53,744 --> 00:51:56,245
Runner...

796
00:51:56,247 --> 00:51:59,181
I am dealing with
some really bad stuff.

797
00:51:59,183 --> 00:52:00,282
Oh, really?

798
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:01,984
Ben is in big trouble.

799
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:05,754
It's bad. He'll need a lawyer.

800
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,457
So you do have money.

801
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:11,193
No, I don't.

802
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:13,462
Lawyers cost money.

803
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:17,099
Okay, so you got jewelry,
don't you?

804
00:52:17,101 --> 00:52:18,767
You got some jewelry,
what about that ring I gave you?

805
00:52:18,769 --> 00:52:20,302
- The engagement ring?
- Yeah, the engagement ring.

806
00:52:20,304 --> 00:52:23,038
If what was worth anything I would
have pawned it off years ago.

807
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,541
What about this?
What about this?

808
00:52:25,543 --> 00:52:26,942
Those are real rubies, right?

809
00:52:26,944 --> 00:52:28,911
That is my grandmothers cross
and you know how much

810
00:52:28,913 --> 00:52:31,073
that means to me
and that stays in my family.

811
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:33,816
You're going to be
really sorry, Patty.

812
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:37,553
I've been sorry a long time.

813
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:56,438
Bye, girls.

814
00:52:57,407 --> 00:53:00,543
Your mom is a cunt!

815
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:05,247
Thanks for fucking nothing!

816
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:37,046
We don't open
for another hour.

817
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:43,452
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
This is a men's hostel.

818
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:47,456
I'm looking for someone. Runner day.
Are you the manager?

819
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:50,226
Manager, accountant, priest.

820
00:53:50,228 --> 00:53:51,827
But he's gone again.

821
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:55,231
I don't allow drinkers here,
and he just got his third strike.

822
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:56,699
You know where
I could find him?

823
00:53:56,701 --> 00:54:00,069
Well, I would bet anything he's
living at that toxic waste site.

824
00:54:00,071 --> 00:54:03,739
That's an old dumping spot
for grasshopper bait.

825
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,507
Loaded with arsenic.

826
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:09,078
Just prepare yourself
for some disappointment.

827
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:18,887
I wonder
what it said about me?

828
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:25,194
That my own father was living
in a toxic waste dump.

829
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:40,102
Don't even think about...

830
00:55:40,104 --> 00:55:43,806
Put the gun down!
It's your daughter!

831
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:47,676
Prove it.

832
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,347
I can't prove it.

833
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:01,857
Well, well, come on down.

834
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:12,768
Come on down!

835
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:28,784
No, don't touch me.

836
00:56:28,786 --> 00:56:30,386
- Daddy's got ya.
- Get your hands off me!

837
00:56:30,388 --> 00:56:31,653
Remember when you
were a little girl?

838
00:56:31,655 --> 00:56:33,555
- No! No!
- Say uncle!

839
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:35,724
- No! Let me go!
- Say uncle!

840
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:37,593
- No! Uncle!
- Say uncle!

841
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,161
Fuck!

842
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:50,506
Jesus.

843
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:56,145
How long has it been
since I've seen you?

844
00:56:57,947 --> 00:57:01,183
Do you remember that flamingo
ashtray I sent you?

845
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:05,654
Yeah,
when I was 10 years old
and a non-smoker.

846
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:07,189
Nice, huh?

847
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:13,929
You know why I'm here, runner.

848
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:19,368
It's time you tell the truth
about the murders.

849
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:26,975
Ben was no babe in the woods.

850
00:57:26,977 --> 00:57:30,257
You hang with the devil and sooner
or later you're going to have to pay.

851
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:35,217
I should have known it,
as soon as I saw him
with that goddamn injun.

852
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:37,219
- Who?
- Trey teepano.

853
00:57:40,391 --> 00:57:41,390
You know what...

854
00:57:41,392 --> 00:57:45,727
People don't know shit about
what really happened that night.

855
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:51,033
Who ended up
with the money, huh?

856
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:54,670
'Cause it sure as
hell wasn't me.

857
00:57:54,672 --> 00:57:57,406
- You know we had no money.
- Your mom had money.

858
00:57:57,408 --> 00:57:58,740
Your queen bitch mom!

859
00:58:00,076 --> 00:58:02,678
What happened to Patty's
life insurance money, huh?

860
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:03,979
Because I sure as shit
didn't get it.

861
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:06,381
You know it went to Diane.
She used it to defend Ben.

862
00:58:06,383 --> 00:58:09,685
I worked years on that farm
and I never received a dime!

863
00:58:10,086 --> 00:58:12,087
That bitch even
asked me for alimony!

864
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:17,526
Is that what happened? Hmm?

865
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:21,115
You go there that night,
ask her for money?

866
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,533
Get in a fight.

867
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,169
What I'm trying to tell you

868
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:30,506
is that Trey was a bookie
who needed to get paid.

869
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,274
And what, you owed him money?

870
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:36,411
No, no, no.
You want everything for free.

871
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:41,216
And you wrote that book.
You wrote a book, right?

872
00:58:41,218 --> 00:58:42,298
So you have got money!

873
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:43,952
- I haven't got...
- You've got money.

874
00:58:43,954 --> 00:58:46,021
Get your fucking hands off me!

875
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:50,692
Fuck!

876
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:57,199
Are you scared of me?

877
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:09,077
Where were you
that night, runner?

878
00:59:11,147 --> 00:59:12,981
I don't remember a thing.

879
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:34,636
Hey, did they ever
find diadra?

880
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,608
You mean diondra?

881
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:41,944
I always wondered
if they killed her that night.

882
00:59:44,113 --> 00:59:45,847
What are you talking about?

883
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:48,563
That's what they do,
don't they?

884
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,619
Devil worshipers?

885
00:59:51,187 --> 00:59:53,989
They kill pregnant ladies
and their babies.

886
01:00:07,871 --> 01:00:08,871
You are.

887
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:13,375
Hey, runner.

888
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:17,112
Come here.

889
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:22,017
I don't have it, man.
I tried to scrape it together.

890
01:00:22,019 --> 01:00:23,919
I did, but I just don't.

891
01:00:23,921 --> 01:00:26,021
Hey, honey.
You gonna say hi to me?

892
01:00:26,023 --> 01:00:28,690
Oh, diondra.

893
01:00:28,692 --> 01:00:30,258
I must be oblivious here,

894
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,961
I'm drinking myself cross-eyed because
I'm so worried about this situation.

895
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:34,196
See, I don't get it runner.

896
01:00:34,198 --> 01:00:35,464
You say you
don't have any money,

897
01:00:35,466 --> 01:00:38,000
but you had that giant stack
of weed just a few weeks ago.

898
01:00:38,002 --> 01:00:39,368
I didn't charge you nothin'.

899
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:41,703
Because you owe me!

900
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:43,905
You guys love to gamble,
but you never want to pay!

901
01:00:43,907 --> 01:00:46,241
I'd say that's
an exaggeration, Trey.

902
01:00:46,243 --> 01:00:48,777
I know someone else
who needs money.

903
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:53,181
God.

904
01:00:53,183 --> 01:00:55,584
Look at this
black hair you have.

905
01:00:55,852 --> 01:00:58,052
I didn't know you knew Trey.
You owe him money?

906
01:00:58,421 --> 01:00:59,988
No, I don't owe him anything.

907
01:01:00,456 --> 01:01:03,425
- He wants money for his girl.
- Tomorrow night.

908
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:08,263
Here. Or so help me, runner,
I will hurt you.

909
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,588
Hey, I want to
tell you something.

910
01:01:14,137 --> 01:01:15,337
What?

911
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:18,340
I got diondra... she's...

912
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:21,777
I got her pregnant.
We're having a baby.

913
01:01:25,648 --> 01:01:26,982
Make sure it's yours.

914
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:30,252
Okay. 'Cause I doubt it is.

915
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,122
Look...

916
01:01:34,124 --> 01:01:36,124
Why would
a rich slut like her

917
01:01:36,126 --> 01:01:38,060
hang around a loser like you?

918
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:41,697
Think about it.

919
01:01:56,412 --> 01:01:57,813
You okay, baby?

920
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:02,150
Someone should fucking die.

921
01:02:05,855 --> 01:02:07,122
You got anything?

922
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:10,759
In the glove compartment.

923
01:02:26,943 --> 01:02:28,310
What is that stuff?

924
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,912
Devil's rush. Ever had it?

925
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:42,124
Come on.

926
01:02:42,126 --> 01:02:43,492
No, man. I don't need it.

927
01:02:43,494 --> 01:02:46,661
You're gonna need it, do it.
Maybe later you become a man?

928
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:48,997
Maybe.

929
01:02:48,999 --> 01:02:50,966
Come on, baby. Come on.

930
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,072
Yeah!

931
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,144
No, I want the axe!

932
01:03:02,146 --> 01:03:03,612
Too heavy for you.

933
01:03:09,051 --> 01:03:11,486
It's sharp,
so don't fuck around.

934
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,872
To Satan,
we bring our sacrifices.

935
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:34,709
We bring pain, blood, fear...

936
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:37,312
Rage.

937
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:38,647
Basis of human life.

938
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:43,218
In your power,
we become more powerful.

939
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:44,820
That one!

940
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:49,391
In your exaltation,
we become exalted.

941
01:03:52,796 --> 01:03:56,498
We're going to make your baby
a fucking warrior tonight, dio!

942
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:05,707
Come on, baby!

943
01:04:05,709 --> 01:04:08,829
You can't just fucking stand there,
It's time to get your kill!

944
01:04:10,713 --> 01:04:13,014
This is your chance, dude.
Be a man!

945
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:14,749
I used to be like you.

946
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:17,398
I don't ever want to
go back there again!

947
01:04:17,887 --> 01:04:21,256
Don't be a scared,
dickless boy the rest of your life!

948
01:04:21,258 --> 01:04:23,258
Aren't you tired
of being scared? Huh?

949
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:25,093
Come on!

950
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:34,536
- You trust runner over me?
- I don't trust anyone.

951
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:37,639
How much?
How much money are they paying you?

952
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:40,141
I don't know what
you're talking about.

953
01:04:40,143 --> 01:04:41,509
What, you thought I
didn't know about that?

954
01:04:41,511 --> 01:04:42,711
Yeah, I got paid.

955
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,379
It's not about that anymore.

956
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:45,680
What is it about, the truth?

957
01:04:45,815 --> 01:04:47,382
Listen, there's no way
you can win this.

958
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:51,319
If I tell you I'm innocent,
that means you ruined my life,
sister.

959
01:04:51,787 --> 01:04:53,054
And if I tell you I'm guilty,

960
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:54,456
well, that doesn't make
you feel much better now...

961
01:04:54,458 --> 01:04:56,224
- Where's diondra?
- Oh, let it go. I have.

962
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:57,559
What'd you do
with the baby, Ben?

963
01:04:57,561 --> 01:04:58,727
What baby?

964
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:00,495
Are you going to
keep bullshitting me?

965
01:05:00,497 --> 01:05:01,529
Let it go, Libby.

966
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:02,998
What about Trey teepano?

967
01:05:03,132 --> 01:05:05,332
He said what he had to say
on the witness stand.

968
01:05:06,102 --> 01:05:07,168
That's too easy.

969
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:14,175
You listen to me.
Today, I can forgive your past lie.

970
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:17,145
For being confused as a kid.

971
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,215
But god damn it,
you're a grown up now.

972
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:23,151
Do you really think that our
blood could do something like that?

973
01:05:23,153 --> 01:05:25,754
I totally believe our blood
could do something like that.

974
01:05:25,756 --> 01:05:28,189
I've beaten the shit
out of people, Ben.

975
01:05:28,191 --> 01:05:31,111
I've busted in doors and windows,
I've killed things!

976
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:36,044
Half the time I look down
and my hands are in fists.

977
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:40,568
Do you really believe
we're that bad?

978
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:41,570
I do.

979
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:43,405
Even with mom's blood.

980
01:05:45,808 --> 01:05:46,808
Even with.

981
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:51,746
Then I'm sad for you,
little girl.

982
01:05:51,748 --> 01:05:52,748
Go fuck yourself!

983
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:57,018
- Is that funny to you?
- No. it's ironic.

984
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:58,186
What?

985
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:01,423
You're just as
imprisoned as I am.

986
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:39,761
It's okay, sweetie.

987
01:06:39,763 --> 01:06:42,864
No, it's not. I want Ben back.

988
01:06:42,866 --> 01:06:46,501
Why can't we find him?
Is he in trouble because of his hair?

989
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:50,005
No, it's because of sex.
Everyone at school knows.

990
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:52,674
What are you talking about?

991
01:06:55,444 --> 01:06:57,612
Ben is your brother,
you don't talk hateful about your brother.

992
01:06:57,614 --> 01:07:00,515
But mom, I don't like Ben!
He's bad...

993
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:02,250
He does bad things!

994
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:10,859
Has he ever touched you in a
strange way or an unbrotherly way?

995
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:14,696
The only time he touches me is when
he's pushing me or pulling my hair.

996
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:16,297
Mom, he's a freak!

997
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:18,366
It's embarrassing,
just go in his room,

998
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:20,288
he's got all sorts
of weird stuff.

999
01:07:20,903 --> 01:07:22,270
You snooped in his room?

1000
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:47,188
- Hello?
- Patty?

1001
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:49,390
It's Joseph, from the fha.

1002
01:08:49,392 --> 01:08:52,894
Joseph,
I can't find the money.
I've had a rough day.

1003
01:08:52,896 --> 01:08:55,330
Yes, I heard about Ben.

1004
01:08:55,332 --> 01:09:00,168
I wasn't going to phone you.
But how should I say this.
Patty, I trust you.

1005
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:04,072
I pray for you. I may have
a solution to your problem.

1006
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:07,442
I thought we were
out of options.

1007
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:09,244
Not entirely.

1008
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,148
- Yeah.
- Libby, Libby.

1009
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:14,616
We found diondra sue Wertzner.

1010
01:09:14,618 --> 01:09:16,584
Born on march 28th, 1968.

1011
01:09:16,586 --> 01:09:21,489
Was officially reported missing on
October 19th, 1985, and has never been found.

1012
01:09:21,491 --> 01:09:23,925
So what the fuck
does that mean? She's dead?

1013
01:09:23,927 --> 01:09:26,967
I don't know, we can't be sure.
But did Ben tell you anything?

1014
01:09:28,865 --> 01:09:29,865
Hang on.

1015
01:09:43,913 --> 01:09:47,282
Hey, told you
I'd pay you back.

1016
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:51,653
When I saw your name
on that note...

1017
01:09:51,655 --> 01:09:53,488
I should have
recognized you right away,

1018
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:56,291
but I kinda
followed your story,

1019
01:09:56,293 --> 01:09:57,959
but it's been
such a long time ago.

1020
01:09:57,961 --> 01:09:58,993
What do you want?

1021
01:10:01,731 --> 01:10:04,365
You're not gonna make this
easy for me, are you?

1022
01:10:07,136 --> 01:10:08,236
Fair enough.

1023
01:10:11,006 --> 01:10:13,408
I was a pretty girl.

1024
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:16,311
I was good in school,
and Ben...

1025
01:10:16,313 --> 01:10:18,513
He did volunteer work.

1026
01:10:18,515 --> 01:10:20,048
He gave drawing lessons.

1027
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:22,584
I had a big crush on him.

1028
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:26,287
We started
hanging out together.

1029
01:10:26,289 --> 01:10:29,390
I know we were both kids,
but he was old enough.

1030
01:10:29,392 --> 01:10:30,692
To not have encouraged me.

1031
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:38,299
It was my first
big grown-up kiss.

1032
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:41,903
It only lasted about a second.

1033
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:45,974
And afterwards, of course,
he told me that we should never do it again,

1034
01:10:45,976 --> 01:10:47,242
'cause it was wrong.

1035
01:10:49,144 --> 01:10:51,813
But he kept writing me notes.

1036
01:10:51,815 --> 01:10:54,182
But he refused to spend
any more time with me.

1037
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:57,719
And I was furious.

1038
01:10:57,721 --> 01:11:02,523
Then, about a week later
I went to a slumber party

1039
01:11:02,525 --> 01:11:05,193
and I told all the girls about
my high school boyfriend.

1040
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:10,365
All proud.
And I made up things that we did.

1041
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:14,269
And from there
it just snowballed.

1042
01:11:14,271 --> 01:11:16,504
We made up this
whole imaginary world,

1043
01:11:16,506 --> 01:11:18,606
where Ben was
a devil worshiper.

1044
01:11:19,475 --> 01:11:23,444
Kind of stories we saw on the news
every day when we were kids.

1045
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,238
Ma'am.

1046
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:55,677
Your son is about to be arrested,
and I know what for.

1047
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:57,812
In this next year you
will need some money

1048
01:11:57,814 --> 01:11:59,847
so you can keep
your children at home.

1049
01:11:59,849 --> 01:12:01,729
And you will
need a good lawyer.

1050
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:05,486
'Cause you don't want your son
going to prison labeled a child molester.

1051
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:07,622
What do you have to offer?

1052
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:11,025
Now I myself
was once a farmer.

1053
01:12:11,027 --> 01:12:13,261
My dad before me
and his dad before him.

1054
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:16,331
But we farmers,
we'd been swindled.

1055
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:19,133
"Plant fence post to
fence post," they said.

1056
01:12:19,135 --> 01:12:20,768
"Oh, and then buy
more land, because,

1057
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:22,810
"well, they ain't
making any more of it."

1058
01:12:23,138 --> 01:12:27,342
Then, whoops. "We're sorry,
we gave you some bad advice.

1059
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:29,777
"We'll just take your farm."

1060
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:33,348
What does this have
to do with my son?

1061
01:12:35,452 --> 01:12:36,818
Ma'am.

1062
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:40,521
I'm no businessman.
And I'm no judge.

1063
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:43,825
I'm certainly no politician.

1064
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:47,161
But if you're brave enough.

1065
01:12:47,163 --> 01:12:49,831
I'll give you a real chance
to help your family.

1066
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:11,746
Your brother needs you, Libby.

1067
01:14:11,748 --> 01:14:14,415
He doesn't, and he's been
pretty clear about that.

1068
01:14:14,417 --> 01:14:17,618
Now that you've explored the
case with all its inconsistencies,

1069
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:20,455
don't you think that Ben
deserves a new, fair trial?

1070
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:24,225
Based on what evidence?
What do we know for sure?

1071
01:14:24,227 --> 01:14:25,927
He's lying about diondra. Why?

1072
01:14:25,929 --> 01:14:29,230
But, everybody's a liar.
I lied to get you to kc.

1073
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:32,266
You lied when you said you
saw what happened that day,

1074
01:14:32,268 --> 01:14:33,468
it doesn't make us murderers.

1075
01:14:33,936 --> 01:14:36,270
What makes you so sure I lied?

1076
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:43,277
Why are you so
obsessed with this case?

1077
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:45,413
It's not even your story,
it's mine.

1078
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:51,352
It's a fascinating puzzle,
a mystery with lots of different theories.

1079
01:14:51,354 --> 01:14:54,555
Most of all, there's you
and Ben and Krissi.

1080
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:58,793
Kids who started events that became bigger
than them and had major repercussions.

1081
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:02,063
- I'm fascinated by that.
- Why?

1082
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:10,471
You ever heard about those
wildfires near San Bernardino in 1999?

1083
01:15:10,473 --> 01:15:13,608
They destroyed, like, 80 homes
and about 90,000 acres?

1084
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:17,078
I don't know, seems like
California is always burning.

1085
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,882
I was the kid
who set that fire.

1086
01:15:25,053 --> 01:15:27,288
Then shouldn't you have become
a firefighter or something,

1087
01:15:27,290 --> 01:15:29,457
overcome your trauma that way?

1088
01:15:35,998 --> 01:15:37,331
So, did you?

1089
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:38,766
Did I what?

1090
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:41,502
Did you lie that day in court?

1091
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:02,123
Hello!

1092
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:09,797
Hello?

1093
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:21,255
- Can I help you?
- Hey.

1094
01:16:21,376 --> 01:16:23,216
We're looking
for Trey teepano.

1095
01:16:23,812 --> 01:16:25,313
That'd be me.

1096
01:16:25,315 --> 01:16:28,076
Want to talk to you about Ben day.
My brother.

1097
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:44,365
You're the one who lived,
huh? Debbie?

1098
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:46,167
Libby.

1099
01:16:47,002 --> 01:16:48,636
You remember runner day?

1100
01:16:49,671 --> 01:16:51,872
He said you were a bookie or something,
back then.

1101
01:16:52,574 --> 01:16:54,742
Yeah. Runner owed
me a lot of money.

1102
01:16:56,678 --> 01:16:58,512
Still does, I guess, huh.

1103
01:17:00,482 --> 01:17:03,150
It doesn't mean I know what
happened in your house that night.

1104
01:17:03,485 --> 01:17:05,325
You were into
devil worshiping?

1105
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:09,190
I'm reformed now.
I'm a good god-fearin' Indian.

1106
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,428
You remember diondra Wertzner?

1107
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:17,999
Your brother.

1108
01:17:18,001 --> 01:17:20,041
Your brother was
crazy about that girl.

1109
01:17:20,435 --> 01:17:24,205
Parents neglected her,
so she was always creating drama.

1110
01:17:24,207 --> 01:17:26,207
She'd run away,
come back home.

1111
01:17:26,209 --> 01:17:27,608
Total soap opera.

1112
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:30,177
This time, I guess,
she just ran away for good, huh?

1113
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:33,414
She's been listed as a
missing person for 25 years.

1114
01:17:33,849 --> 01:17:35,549
Yeah,
she was one of them girls

1115
01:17:35,551 --> 01:17:37,251
who was always
trying to be someone else.

1116
01:17:37,253 --> 01:17:41,555
She'd talk in an English accent one day
and next day it'd be Southern.

1117
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:44,191
She liked to use
her porn name, too.

1118
01:17:44,193 --> 01:17:45,726
- She did porn?
- No.

1119
01:17:45,728 --> 01:17:49,230
It was that game.
What was the name of your childhood pet?

1120
01:17:52,502 --> 01:17:55,069
And what was the name
of the street you grew up on?

1121
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:56,203
Rural route 2.

1122
01:17:58,573 --> 01:18:00,241
Well,
that's not going to work.

1123
01:18:00,243 --> 01:18:02,309
It's supposed to sound slutty.

1124
01:18:02,311 --> 01:18:05,613
You know,
like Bambi evergreen.
What was diondra's...

1125
01:18:05,615 --> 01:18:07,615
it was, uh, Polly something...

1126
01:18:09,818 --> 01:18:11,252
Polly Palm.

1127
01:18:12,821 --> 01:18:15,656
What was the name your brother
had tattooed on his arm?

1128
01:18:15,658 --> 01:18:18,059
- Oh, my god!
- It was Polly, right?

1129
01:18:19,761 --> 01:18:22,263
I got her. Polly Palm
in kearney, Missouri.

1130
01:18:22,265 --> 01:18:23,898
The only one listed
in the whole country

1131
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:25,940
apart for a nail boutique
in shreveport.

1132
01:18:40,615 --> 01:18:43,317
Something like me,
with open arms, I tell you...

1133
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:49,523
I don't feel good.
I think I need something to eat.

1134
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:55,796
What?

1135
01:18:57,699 --> 01:18:59,333
You're fucked.

1136
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:03,471
Hey, dio, it's Megan.
I'm totally freaked out about Ben day.

1137
01:19:03,473 --> 01:19:05,513
Did you hear he
molested all these girls?

1138
01:19:07,176 --> 01:19:10,444
Hey, diondra, it's Jenny.
I hear Ben's running from the cops.

1139
01:19:10,446 --> 01:19:13,781
You're not with him, are you?
Please tell me you're not with him.

1140
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:24,358
I guess I should go home.

1141
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:26,293
Okay, and what?

1142
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:28,882
Leave me here
while you go to jail?

1143
01:19:29,064 --> 01:19:30,297
What do you want me to do?

1144
01:19:30,299 --> 01:19:31,499
We're leaving town tonight.

1145
01:19:31,501 --> 01:19:33,367
I have like $200
left from my parents.

1146
01:19:33,369 --> 01:19:35,289
How much do you
have at your place?

1147
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:37,571
I've got some saved up.

1148
01:19:37,573 --> 01:19:40,241
My mom, she's got, like,
500 or 600 lying around.

1149
01:19:40,675 --> 01:19:42,109
But I don't know where.

1150
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:43,551
Yeah, all right
we'll go there. Okay.

1151
01:19:44,012 --> 01:19:46,313
If we don't see a cop car outside,
we'll go inside,

1152
01:19:46,315 --> 01:19:48,249
we'll get the cash,
we'll pack a bag

1153
01:19:48,251 --> 01:19:50,017
and we'll get the fuck
out of here, okay?

1154
01:19:50,252 --> 01:19:53,220
Then what? What
fucking planet are you on?

1155
01:19:54,156 --> 01:19:56,076
Are you even sure
this kid's mine?

1156
01:19:56,925 --> 01:19:58,926
How dare you!

1157
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:09,570
Ben.

1158
01:20:11,339 --> 01:20:14,008
Ben, baby,
I love you, you know.

1159
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:16,710
And I swear to god
this child's yours.

1160
01:20:16,712 --> 01:20:19,079
I swear to god, but you got to
get me out of town, okay?

1161
01:20:19,081 --> 01:20:22,249
And we gotta head west.
Otherwise you're in jail.

1162
01:20:23,351 --> 01:20:25,019
You're in jail and
I'm dead from my daddy.

1163
01:20:25,021 --> 01:20:28,389
He'll make me have the baby,
then he'll kill me.

1164
01:21:03,491 --> 01:21:04,658
Yeah?

1165
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:08,429
You know who I am?

1166
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,934
Holy crap! Libby.

1167
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:17,571
I always thought
you'd find me someday.

1168
01:21:18,106 --> 01:21:19,573
Smart girl.

1169
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:23,143
Stay!

1170
01:21:23,912 --> 01:21:26,180
So, this is out of the blue.

1171
01:21:26,182 --> 01:21:28,142
I mean, why come
looking for me now?

1172
01:21:28,583 --> 01:21:30,117
Did Ben say something to you?

1173
01:21:31,086 --> 01:21:32,853
No, that's why I'm here.

1174
01:21:32,855 --> 01:21:36,090
So you think that
once you know the truth,

1175
01:21:36,092 --> 01:21:37,524
you'll find peace?

1176
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:40,027
Like, somehow
that will fix you?

1177
01:21:45,634 --> 01:21:47,134
I was with Ben that night.

1178
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:51,438
We were going to skip town.

1179
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:54,508
And he went to his house
to get some money.

1180
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:56,477
An hour goes by, two hours.

1181
01:21:57,479 --> 01:21:59,713
Finally,
I thought he lost his nerve.

1182
01:22:00,882 --> 01:22:02,883
Cried myself to sleep
that night.

1183
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:09,623
In the morning, when I heard
about the murders.

1184
01:22:11,126 --> 01:22:13,928
Packed my bags,
left a note for my father

1185
01:22:13,930 --> 01:22:16,563
telling him I was not
his little girl anymore.

1186
01:22:18,133 --> 01:22:20,301
Skipped town for good.

1187
01:22:20,303 --> 01:22:22,870
Ben never gave
my name to the police.

1188
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,207
After all these years.

1189
01:22:28,643 --> 01:22:30,311
He protected me.

1190
01:22:36,818 --> 01:22:39,698
So, no one but him knows
what happened that night.

1191
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:43,257
I do think you that
you could find this peace

1192
01:22:43,259 --> 01:22:45,859
that you're looking for
if you accept that.

1193
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:48,729
Look, I hate to say this,

1194
01:22:48,731 --> 01:22:52,166
but whatever happened,
and as much as I loved Ben,

1195
01:22:54,669 --> 01:22:57,338
he needed to be
in that prison.

1196
01:22:57,340 --> 01:22:59,606
There was something
inside your brother

1197
01:22:59,608 --> 01:23:01,742
that was not right
for the outside world.

1198
01:23:09,884 --> 01:23:11,685
You were pregnant.

1199
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:18,792
What happened to the baby?

1200
01:23:19,894 --> 01:23:21,295
I'm here.

1201
01:24:02,904 --> 01:24:05,773
What are you doing?
I told you to wait in the car.

1202
01:24:08,076 --> 01:24:10,077
I know you did, but...

1203
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:13,680
Baby, I'm hearing
voices in my head.

1204
01:24:13,682 --> 01:24:14,848
Shh, shh.
You got to be quiet, okay.

1205
01:24:14,850 --> 01:24:15,983
I don't want to be alone.

1206
01:24:15,985 --> 01:24:17,418
I know.

1207
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:19,540
It's just the drugs.
They'll wear off, okay.

1208
01:24:22,123 --> 01:24:23,457
I like your house.

1209
01:24:31,266 --> 01:24:32,466
Be quiet.

1210
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:45,045
What's going on?

1211
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:47,381
Somebody's been in my room.

1212
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:50,284
Oh, god. You don't...

1213
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,488
You don't think
it's the cops, do you?

1214
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:55,622
I don't know.

1215
01:24:57,158 --> 01:24:59,460
I got a present for you,
for the baby.

1216
01:25:02,897 --> 01:25:05,332
- You got me a present?
- Yeah, but it's not here.

1217
01:25:09,738 --> 01:25:11,572
Who is that?

1218
01:25:11,574 --> 01:25:13,974
It's okay, it's just Libby,
she's going into mom's room.

1219
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:34,161
There's less than I thought.

1220
01:25:35,029 --> 01:25:37,030
I fucking know
it was Michelle.

1221
01:25:39,167 --> 01:25:42,407
It was Michelle that stole my fucking present,
that nosy little bitch.

1222
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:50,344
This doesn't feel right.

1223
01:26:00,288 --> 01:26:02,356
I knew it! I heard everything!

1224
01:26:02,358 --> 01:26:03,358
Come here!

1225
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:05,792
Get out of my way.

1226
01:26:07,195 --> 01:26:09,315
You don't say another word,
you little bitch!

1227
01:26:09,364 --> 01:26:10,797
Stop! Stop!
She's not gonna say anything.

1228
01:26:10,799 --> 01:26:12,099
Ben, get off me.

1229
01:26:12,567 --> 01:26:13,634
Come here.

1230
01:26:19,807 --> 01:26:21,542
Diondra, stop it! Stop!

1231
01:26:23,745 --> 01:26:26,146
Dio, stop. You'll wake up
the whole fucking house.

1232
01:26:26,148 --> 01:26:27,948
If you think I'm going to
spend my entire fucking life

1233
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:29,983
worrying about this little bitch,
you're wrong, Ben!

1234
01:26:29,985 --> 01:26:32,486
Get off of her.
Dio, stop. Listen to me.

1235
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:35,261
We'll talk to her, okay?
She'll understand. Stop.

1236
01:26:36,891 --> 01:26:37,958
Ben?

1237
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:40,627
Hey! it's okay. Okay?

1238
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:53,240
I was never
supposed to meet you.

1239
01:26:54,676 --> 01:26:56,109
I'm a secret, you know.

1240
01:27:00,081 --> 01:27:01,815
A secret love child.

1241
01:27:03,084 --> 01:27:04,418
That's right, baby.

1242
01:27:05,019 --> 01:27:07,988
Crystal knows the whole story.
I tell her everything.

1243
01:27:08,356 --> 01:27:09,656
We're best friends.

1244
01:27:10,692 --> 01:27:12,125
I read your book, too.

1245
01:27:13,595 --> 01:27:16,763
I even have a little scrapbook
of photos of all of you.

1246
01:27:17,732 --> 01:27:19,333
Clipped out of
magazines and stuff.

1247
01:27:19,335 --> 01:27:21,868
It's like a fake
family photo album.

1248
01:27:27,041 --> 01:27:28,875
Can I call you aunt Libby?

1249
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:35,148
I know that this is
a lot to take in.

1250
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:39,486
Want a drink?

1251
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:45,659
- I need to use your bathroom.
- It's just up the stairs.

1252
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:06,280
- Yeah?
- Libby.

1253
01:28:06,282 --> 01:28:08,522
Libby, I know the whole story now.
You need to hear this.

1254
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:09,910
What are you talking about?

1255
01:28:10,184 --> 01:28:11,752
You remember
the theory the kill club had

1256
01:28:11,754 --> 01:28:13,874
about the serial killer
they called the angel of debt?

1257
01:28:14,088 --> 01:28:15,622
Yeah?

1258
01:28:15,624 --> 01:28:17,024
They got him,
I mean, we got him.

1259
01:28:17,026 --> 01:28:19,259
One of our members
posed as a bankrupt

1260
01:28:19,261 --> 01:28:21,428
hedge fund manager
in a suburb of Chicago

1261
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:24,331
and this guy Calvin Diehl,
tried to help him stage his death.

1262
01:28:24,333 --> 01:28:25,666
Diehl used to be a farmer

1263
01:28:25,668 --> 01:28:27,668
who lost everything to the
banks in the Soviet Embargo.

1264
01:28:27,670 --> 01:28:28,869
So what?

1265
01:28:28,871 --> 01:28:30,504
He's been at it
since the '80s.

1266
01:28:30,506 --> 01:28:33,106
Making suicides look like
accidents or murders.

1267
01:28:33,541 --> 01:28:35,501
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1268
01:28:36,210 --> 01:28:38,679
Your mother had
hired him for that night.

1269
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:43,750
Are you sure?

1270
01:28:46,854 --> 01:28:49,890
Listen, Lyle,
can you come get me?

1271
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:51,858
Okay.

1272
01:28:52,694 --> 01:28:54,161
- Libby?
- Yeah?

1273
01:28:54,163 --> 01:28:55,329
Is everything okay?

1274
01:28:55,331 --> 01:28:57,291
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just need a second.

1275
01:28:58,866 --> 01:29:01,034
I'm sorry,
but I really need to go.

1276
01:29:01,036 --> 01:29:02,869
I'll be out in a second, okay?

1277
01:29:09,277 --> 01:29:10,577
Fuck!

1278
01:29:39,941 --> 01:29:41,608
Libby?

1279
01:29:42,910 --> 01:29:45,712
Yeah. Yeah, I'm coming.

1280
01:29:57,725 --> 01:29:59,226
You okay?

1281
01:29:59,228 --> 01:30:00,560
Yeah, I'm fine.

1282
01:30:01,763 --> 01:30:04,498
Listen,
I'm gonna wait outside,
my friend is coming for me.

1283
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:08,301
I really need you to
keep this a secret, okay?
I can't risk it.

1284
01:30:08,303 --> 01:30:10,504
Them thinking I'm an accomplice,
you understand?

1285
01:30:10,838 --> 01:30:14,474
Why would they think that?
Were you at the house that night?

1286
01:30:21,783 --> 01:30:22,916
No!

1287
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:08,228
Don't worry, it'll all be over
in about 30 seconds.

1288
01:31:11,666 --> 01:31:13,133
Go tell mom.

1289
01:31:13,135 --> 01:31:14,401
Come here!

1290
01:31:14,403 --> 01:31:15,902
Get the fuck off her!

1291
01:31:21,075 --> 01:31:22,342
What the hell?

1292
01:31:22,344 --> 01:31:24,478
Mom, they're hurting Michelle!

1293
01:31:24,645 --> 01:31:26,713
Run! Run!

1294
01:31:30,651 --> 01:31:32,085
No! No, please don't!

1295
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:33,553
No!

1296
01:31:36,425 --> 01:31:38,091
Why'd you make me do this?

1297
01:31:38,093 --> 01:31:40,133
- Don't do it. No!
- This wasn't the plan.

1298
01:31:42,364 --> 01:31:43,597
Get the fuck off of her.

1299
01:31:55,710 --> 01:31:57,110
Oh, my god!

1300
01:32:29,510 --> 01:32:33,046
Mom, I'm sorry.
I saw the cross was gone and I panicked.

1301
01:32:33,048 --> 01:32:34,314
It's okay, sweetie.

1302
01:32:34,316 --> 01:32:36,883
Go get the gun.
It's in the cabinet.

1303
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:41,288
Where is it? I can't find it!

1304
01:32:41,290 --> 01:32:43,123
It's in the box on the left side.

1305
01:32:43,125 --> 01:32:44,491
I'm looking there,
mom, it's not there.

1306
01:32:44,493 --> 01:32:46,593
- Well, look harder!
- I am looking!

1307
01:32:55,169 --> 01:32:56,736
What did you do to her?

1308
01:32:58,606 --> 01:33:01,141
- I'm calling the police.
- Wait, listen.

1309
01:33:01,143 --> 01:33:03,143
She wouldn't shut up,
all right?

1310
01:33:03,145 --> 01:33:04,778
It's her fault,
she wouldn't shut up!

1311
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:07,581
Where's the little one?

1312
01:33:07,915 --> 01:33:11,418
Oh, shit! Libby! Libby!

1313
01:33:13,754 --> 01:33:15,455
It's gotta be in here!

1314
01:33:15,457 --> 01:33:16,923
I know it's here!

1315
01:33:20,795 --> 01:33:21,962
Stop yelling at me!

1316
01:33:21,964 --> 01:33:24,164
How am I supposed
to find anything in this crap?

1317
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:27,467
- I see it, it's right there.
- Okay, where are the bullets?

1318
01:33:27,469 --> 01:33:28,535
Where are the bullets?

1319
01:33:28,537 --> 01:33:30,236
No, it's loaded, it's fine!

1320
01:33:30,238 --> 01:33:31,671
Mom! Mom!

1321
01:33:40,615 --> 01:33:41,815
Libby?

1322
01:34:06,807 --> 01:34:08,008
Fuck.

1323
01:34:28,462 --> 01:34:30,422
Hey, hey!
Let me do it! Let me do it!

1324
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:33,900
Bitch blocked the door!

1325
01:34:34,969 --> 01:34:36,202
Christ!

1326
01:34:37,371 --> 01:34:38,505
Can you squeeze through?

1327
01:34:53,454 --> 01:34:55,494
- Oh, my god! She got out!
- Grab the gun!

1328
01:35:05,132 --> 01:35:06,433
Damn it!

1329
01:35:09,737 --> 01:35:11,638
Libby! Libby!

1330
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:15,575
Ben, if she saw something,
we got a problem! Ben, baby...

1331
01:35:15,577 --> 01:35:17,610
- What?
- Don't you see how this isn't a coincidence?

1332
01:35:17,612 --> 01:35:19,279
We need money,
then we do the ritual and then, pow!

1333
01:35:19,281 --> 01:35:20,714
Someone kills
your entire family!

1334
01:35:20,716 --> 01:35:22,115
What are you talking about?

1335
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:24,951
You inherit all your
mom's life insurance!

1336
01:35:24,953 --> 01:35:27,153
Whatever you want to do, baby,
you want to go to California,

1337
01:35:27,155 --> 01:35:29,923
you want to live on the beach,
we can do it! Together!

1338
01:35:33,527 --> 01:35:35,995
If you want me to,
I can take care of her myself.

1339
01:35:38,833 --> 01:35:40,500
No, I'll get her.

1340
01:36:49,503 --> 01:36:52,672
Mom, we're not going to find her.
She could be anywhere by now.

1341
01:36:53,808 --> 01:36:55,408
She can't be far.

1342
01:36:55,410 --> 01:36:59,379
Her friend is coming.
What if he called the cops?
We have to go.

1343
01:37:02,016 --> 01:37:03,650
What if they find us?

1344
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:24,070
Libby? Stay where you are,
sweetheart, okay.
Stay there.

1345
01:38:18,259 --> 01:38:19,325
Libby!

1346
01:38:24,665 --> 01:38:25,899
Libby!

1347
01:38:35,709 --> 01:38:37,510
I love you, Libby.

1348
01:38:39,546 --> 01:38:41,314
I love you, ladybug.

1349
01:38:42,016 --> 01:38:44,183
Don't you ever forget that.

1350
01:38:47,989 --> 01:38:49,322
Libby!

1351
01:38:53,093 --> 01:38:54,360
Libby!

1352
01:38:58,966 --> 01:39:00,800
Libby, you okay?
What happened?

1353
01:39:00,802 --> 01:39:01,802
Where are they?

1354
01:39:02,803 --> 01:39:04,883
There's no one here,
I checked the house.

1355
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:07,974
It's okay. Everything's okay.

1356
01:39:15,749 --> 01:39:18,117
Diondra Wertzner,
also known as Polly Palm

1357
01:39:18,119 --> 01:39:20,386
was arrested last night
in amarillo, Texas.

1358
01:39:20,388 --> 01:39:24,857
This is the latest development in
the 1985 Kansas Prairie massacre case.

1359
01:39:24,859 --> 01:39:28,494
Ms. Wertzner was wanted in relation
to the murder of Michelle day

1360
01:39:28,496 --> 01:39:30,063
for which Ben day,
her brother,

1361
01:39:30,065 --> 01:39:32,999
has been in prison
for the last 28 years.

1362
01:39:33,001 --> 01:39:36,903
She denies any involvement
while DNA analysis is pending.

1363
01:39:36,905 --> 01:39:38,638
But it was announced
this morning that Ben day

1364
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,907
will be released
from prison shortly.

1365
01:39:40,909 --> 01:39:43,743
Their daughter,
crystal, is still at large.

1366
01:39:43,745 --> 01:39:46,813
As a reminder,
this is the latest twist in a larger case,

1367
01:39:46,815 --> 01:39:48,648
that of serial killer
Calvin Diehl,

1368
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:51,718
aka the angel of debt
who has killed,

1369
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:54,754
or as he claims,
"helped to die in dignity,"

1370
01:39:54,756 --> 01:39:57,790
more than 50 people
since the early 1980s.

1371
01:39:57,792 --> 01:40:00,526
He had each of his victims
sign what he termed

1372
01:40:00,528 --> 01:40:02,662
a "permission to kill" form

1373
01:40:02,664 --> 01:40:04,697
along with
a letter to loved ones.

1374
01:40:08,869 --> 01:40:12,271
Dear Ben, Michelle,
Libby and debby.

1375
01:40:12,273 --> 01:40:14,974
I don't think this letter
will ever reach you.

1376
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:17,677
But Mr. Diehl said
he'd hold it for me.

1377
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:20,947
And I guess that
gives me some comfort.

1378
01:40:20,949 --> 01:40:24,684
Your grandparents always told me,
"make a useful life."

1379
01:40:24,686 --> 01:40:28,688
I don't think I've really done that,
but I can make a useful death.

1380
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:33,459
My life has been determined
so much by accidents.

1381
01:40:33,461 --> 01:40:36,562
It seems nice now
that an accident on purpose

1382
01:40:36,564 --> 01:40:38,765
will make things right again.

1383
01:40:39,566 --> 01:40:41,701
I hope you all forgive me.

1384
01:40:43,203 --> 01:40:45,905
Take care of yourselves.

1385
01:40:45,907 --> 01:40:48,241
I know Diane
will do right by you.

1386
01:40:48,809 --> 01:40:50,910
I'm only sad
I won't get to see

1387
01:40:50,912 --> 01:40:52,812
the wonderful people
you've become.

1388
01:40:53,981 --> 01:40:56,315
Although I don't need to.

1389
01:40:56,317 --> 01:40:58,157
That's how sure
I am of my kids.

1390
01:41:26,013 --> 01:41:29,053
Diondra was always sure you'd find her.
She was sure of it.

1391
01:41:30,017 --> 01:41:31,818
Guess she was right.

1392
01:41:35,422 --> 01:41:37,090
So you met my daughter.

1393
01:41:40,461 --> 01:41:41,527
Mmm-hmm.

1394
01:41:42,429 --> 01:41:44,597
I've heard different things.
Is she...

1395
01:41:45,399 --> 01:41:47,800
is she like diondra?
Is she bad?

1396
01:41:49,937 --> 01:41:51,604
I don't know.

1397
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:54,740
How does a girl
deal with the fact

1398
01:41:54,742 --> 01:41:56,302
that she knows her mother
is a murderer?

1399
01:41:56,577 --> 01:41:59,645
She can't disappear
for long, I can find her.

1400
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:02,782
She's not going to go
to jail because of me.

1401
01:42:06,153 --> 01:42:07,720
You'd really give her a pass?

1402
01:42:07,722 --> 01:42:09,021
I know a little
bit about people

1403
01:42:09,023 --> 01:42:12,658
trying to do the right thing
and completely fucking up.

1404
01:42:12,660 --> 01:42:14,727
Are you talking
about me or mom?

1405
01:42:14,729 --> 01:42:16,529
I'm talking about me.

1406
01:42:17,264 --> 01:42:19,344
You could've been
talking about any of us.

1407
01:42:19,933 --> 01:42:22,568
28 years I've been
shutting up and taking it.

1408
01:42:24,238 --> 01:42:27,140
28 years I've been protecting
a kid that I never met.

1409
01:42:27,841 --> 01:42:29,976
By leaving her with
your sister's murderer?

1410
01:42:29,978 --> 01:42:31,377
I never said
I did the right thing,

1411
01:42:31,379 --> 01:42:33,246
but I made a choice
and I had to live with it.

1412
01:42:33,248 --> 01:42:35,414
Yeah,
I had to live with it, too.

1413
01:42:36,783 --> 01:42:40,419
But I do wish there was something
I could say to make it better.

1414
01:42:41,555 --> 01:42:43,756
There's nothing left to say.

1415
01:42:45,425 --> 01:42:48,127
You lied. I lied.

1416
01:42:51,532 --> 01:42:52,598
We're even.

1417
01:43:00,274 --> 01:43:01,807
What about us?

1418
01:43:05,279 --> 01:43:07,280
You don't know me, Ben.

1419
01:43:08,148 --> 01:43:10,550
You think you do,
but you don't.

1420
01:43:11,919 --> 01:43:14,487
Just like I don't know you.

1421
01:43:16,490 --> 01:43:19,358
Or mom. Or debby, or Michelle.

1422
01:43:22,896 --> 01:43:25,131
Whatever sliver of
a memory I had of them

1423
01:43:25,133 --> 01:43:26,899
died with them that night.

1424
01:43:32,973 --> 01:43:35,374
I'm so angry at you.

1425
01:43:43,083 --> 01:43:45,251
But you're still my brother.

1426
01:43:47,254 --> 01:43:49,155
You're still my blood.

1427
01:43:50,691 --> 01:43:53,893
I won't let what happened that night,
drive my life anymore.

1428
01:43:57,197 --> 01:43:59,265
I just want to be normal.

1429
01:44:04,638 --> 01:44:09,675
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Libby. I'm sorry.

1430
01:44:25,826 --> 01:44:28,094
You know that horse you were talking about,
yellow?

1431
01:44:28,096 --> 01:44:29,428
Yeah, what about him?

1432
01:44:31,565 --> 01:44:33,399
I don't get it.

1433
01:44:34,968 --> 01:44:36,402
Why yellow?

1434
01:44:38,839 --> 01:44:41,040
I don't know.
Mom named him.

1435
01:44:41,042 --> 01:44:44,110
It's not like he was
a yellow horse or anything.

1436
01:44:45,512 --> 01:44:48,047
I guess she'll keep
that secret with her, huh?

1437
01:44:48,049 --> 01:44:50,383
There's a lot of
other stories, Libby.

1438
01:44:51,184 --> 01:44:55,087
Beautiful ones.
Wasn't all bad, you know.

1439
01:45:01,561 --> 01:45:04,263
I didn't get
straight on the highway.

1440
01:45:04,265 --> 01:45:07,433
But slowly drove to where
our farm had once been.

1441
01:45:09,736 --> 01:45:14,807
Still standing.
That unsafe place.

1442
01:45:17,744 --> 01:45:21,981
That blanked-out space where
my mother so desperately invited death.

1443
01:45:32,592 --> 01:45:34,427
Maybe Ben was right.

1444
01:45:37,731 --> 01:45:39,131
It wasn't all bad.

1445
01:45:49,543 --> 01:45:53,312
Ben learned something in his
prison that I never learned in mine.

1446
01:46:01,588 --> 01:46:03,189
Forgiveness.

1447
01:46:10,063 --> 01:46:14,033
My mom told us
to make a useful life.

1448
01:46:17,738 --> 01:46:19,205
Nothing big.

1449
01:46:24,778 --> 01:46:26,379
Nothing grand.

1450
01:46:28,382 --> 01:46:29,949
Just a start.

1451
01:46:34,721 --> 01:46:37,423
Finally, a start.
