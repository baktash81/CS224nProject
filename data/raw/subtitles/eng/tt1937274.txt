1
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:40,011
"Ten months no rain, the
wait has become unbearable.

2
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,638
The temperatures are getting hot... "

3
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:54,526
Waiting for the monsoons
is hard for everyone.

4
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:59,197
The people are tense

5
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,034
their hearts and
minds have dried up.

6
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,836
For ten months
only scorching sun.

7
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,882
We have been waiting for rain for so long.

8
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:43,158
"Weather warning, fishermen
are particularly affected.

9
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,456
Heavy squalls are expected
between Saint-Louis and Dakar.

10
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,375
Shipping traffic is to be
stopped completely... "

11
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,171
The residents of Saint-Louis
were caught in a sandstorm.

12
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,007
He hit the northern region of the country.

13
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,259
Events like this
are rare here, the

14
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,220
greater the fear and
horror of many people.

15
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:57,978
The monsoon wind, longed
for by us, brings us rain.

16
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:02,065
Then when it sweeps across the

17
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:06,111
ocean, it whips the
ocean into huge waves.

18
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:09,030
When this wind hits land,

19
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,741
it wreaks horrific havoc.

20
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,120
What is good for us here

21
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,579
can be devastating elsewhere.

22
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,957
We regret the chaos

23
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:23,169
that the wind in the Caribbean and on the

24
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:27,507
American continent.

25
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,343
Because its origin is here.

26
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:34,045
"Notos, this is the port watch from Humacao

27
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,216
"Please give instructions on how to break in."

28
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,972
"Notos: port status Yankee,

29
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,975
no permission to enter
until the end of the storm. "

30
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,186
"This is Notos speaking,

31
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,149
our current position is 15.29...

32
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,778
41.8 West...

33
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:03,950
Wind is getting stronger. "

34
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,121
"The Puerto Rico Coast
Guard recommends moving

35
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,291
south to Curacao until
the ports are cleared."

36
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:16,587
"Notos change course to 165 degrees."

37
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,799
Here in the forest the light is sparse

38
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:11,095
and all the trees,
all the plants that

39
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:15,099
grow here need it,
want it for themselves.

40
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:20,480
The competition for
light in the forest is brutal.

41
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:28,779
Therefore, many young plants
spend here in the El Yunque rainforest

42
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:33,993
Decades on the forest
floor before they grow up.

43
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:48,424
"Today's show was canceled.

44
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:53,012
The reason is the impending
tropical storm approaching the island.

45
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:59,018
Warnings were given against rain
and flash floods in the mountain regions.

46
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,854
Everyone on the
beach is asked to

47
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,898
Take safety precautions.

48
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,858
And now it's wetter with Gerry... "

49
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:38,641
We have to get out of here now, Francesca!

50
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,737
This morning at 10:38
a.m., a meteorologist from the

51
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,408
National Weather Service
discovered thunderclouds,

52
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,202
who moved inland via
Ceiba, Fajardo and Luquillo.

53
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,621
These clouds could...

54
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,336
Where should i put this?

55
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,129
In the living room, please.

56
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,297
OK.

57
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,257
Aunt, why are we putting everything away?

58
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,967
Because a storm is coming.

59
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,970
Amanda, take this to the living room.

60
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:23,162
When I was young I found it
appealing to live like a vagabond.

61
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,999
I slept in the open air

62
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,127
covered with a piece of cardboard.

63
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,463
I listened to the
river splashing past.

64
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:41,222
But then a hurricane came and
my situation became very difficult!

65
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,350
Pouring rain, the river that
swelled wetter and wetter...

66
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:49,480
For a moment, in a split second,

67
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,524
everything echoes
through my head.

68
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,944
I suddenly remembered my family.

69
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,155
The good feeling of having a home

70
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,282
To be part of society.

71
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:06,330
And a voice deep
down inside said

72
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,332
I don't want to die here.

73
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,310
"Will Cuba be affected?"

74
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:05,147
Yes, it's possible.  We
followed the storm from Africa.

75
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,691
The tropical storm Lucia
has turned into a cyclone

76
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:11,862
developed in category 1,

77
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,740
south of here, near Puerto Rico.

78
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:10,976
As you know, I just got a call
from the civil protection authority,

79
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,437
the situation is dire.

80
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,272
We have to examine everything

81
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,899
carefully to make
the right decisions.

82
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,901
Is this the latest data?

83
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:21,069
Yes.

84
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:24,823
So, that's the position,
here, the Dominican Republic.

85
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,659
According to some models,
Lucy is moving north,

86
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:33,165
others assume that it is heading
south, very close to Granma.

87
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,752
And these models here show that
she is moving to the south of Jamaica.

88
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:39,796
Everything now depends
on this high pressure area.

89
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:44,676
If it stays that strong,
it will force Lucy

90
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,597
south, and she will not
hit eastern Cuba directly.

91
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,519
Up with it!

92
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,606
Wait a minute.

93
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:58,815
Hurry up!

94
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,693
And see that it is right...

95
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,491
is tied.

96
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,498
Norca, look, in
this photo is the boy

97
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:17,334
only 3 years old!

98
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,378
Hopefully it won't get wet.

99
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,217
Just look how cute the little one looks!

100
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:29,721
-Which little one?
-Josana.

101
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:35,644
A little bit of weather up.

102
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:40,023
Come on, come on, we have to hurry.

103
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:41,316
Yes.

104
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,360
The bus is waiting for us.

105
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:45,195
Lock the door well.

106
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,287
"... hurricane Lucy
only grazed us, the

107
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,790
damage to the
infrastructure is minimal.

108
00:31:57,207 --> 00:32:00,085
The El Yunque
rainforest is hardest hit.

109
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,254
Trees fell, branches fell and

110
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,382
landslides occurred
in some valleys.

111
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,802
More news from San Juan.
The national fishing festival... "

112
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:21,106
Nobody thought it possible

113
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:25,986
that a storm could hit
the rainforest so badly.

114
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,863
We believed it would last forever.

115
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,992
The employees of the

116
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:35,871
forestry office were very sad

117
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:40,250
because they thought El
Yunque was completely destroyed.

118
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:37,821
"We ask you to keep calm.

119
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:41,658
There is room for everyone on the bus. "

120
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:41,809
"Information from the Institute for
Meteorology and the Civil Protection Authority:

121
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:45,229
Cyclone Lucia is a
real threat to the east

122
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:48,399
and the center of our
country.  We request..."

123
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,669
Another new piece of urgent information.

124
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:18,382
A reconnaissance
plane found that

125
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:23,387
the cyclone's
pressure had dropped.

126
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:26,682
That said, Lucy is still getting stronger.

127
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:29,185
With a wind speed of 205 km / h,

128
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:33,814
it is almost a
category 4 hurricane.

129
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,276
"... with reaching warmer
waters in the next few hours

130
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,445
she could get stronger.

131
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:41,364
Your final route
may be in the offing.

132
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:45,952
We therefore recommend to all
citizens of the western regions:

133
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:50,581
Pay close attention to the
development of Hurricane Lucy. "

134
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:13,729
The maximum constant wind force

135
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:18,484
is 240 km / h, in
gusts over 270 km / h.

136
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,820
A dangerous cyclone.

137
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:23,698
Here are the prognoses.

138
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,909
All indications are that the
storm will hit Pinar del Rio.

139
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:33,249
"Heavy rain, strong winds,
strong thunderstorms..."

140
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:05,049
"_... five meter high
waves in this area..."

141
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:08,219
-Listen, listen!
-"_..destroys everything.

142
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,764
... already evacuated.

143
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:15,226
In this area...

144
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:18,479
... there is a mortal danger. ”"

145
00:49:57,786 --> 00:50:01,457
Oh!  The roof is about to fly away!  Do you hear

146
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:04,627
-Oh God, what's up?
-Where are the lamps?

147
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:19,141
She keeps getting stronger!

148
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:24,772
We are waiting for the latest
satellite data.  And then...

149
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:46,330
"... the hurricane left a trail
of destruction in our area.

150
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:52,002
I am now talking to the
journalist Rolando Canauras

151
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:55,589
Sanchez about the latest
details on the events. "

152
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:59,051
"Just a few hours after the
hurricane left you can say..."

153
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:03,230
It was around 5 a.m., I know that
because my television is always on.

154
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:05,941
At around 5 it was said that
the storm had grown weaker,

155
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:10,988
<i>but after this news
fie 
  the power off.</i>

156
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:15,659
I was really scared.

157
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:19,413
And then it started.

158
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:23,041
Suddenly the wall was torn away.

159
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,836
I couldn't see anything anymore.

160
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:30,841
Then the roof was blown away.

161
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:33,510
Nothing was left, I was
completely defenseless.

162
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:35,262
Objects flew through the air.

163
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:37,764
The sheets, everything.

164
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,852
Everything flew through the air.
The wind took everything from me.

165
00:58:56,158 --> 00:59:00,203
We heard the impact of the stones
that the sea hurled against the houses.

166
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:01,538
We heard and felt
the stones hitting

167
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:06,960
the doors and
walls of the houses.

168
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:09,379
It was a terrible noise

169
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,425
the whole time.

170
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:19,890
The roof was gone.

171
00:59:21,183 --> 00:59:23,018
There was silence.

172
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:30,233
We only said the bare essentials
to give each other courage.

173
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:33,653
I thought I was going to pass out.

174
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:37,699
I was so scared, I've
never seen anything like it.

175
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:41,495
Even though I
turned 80 this year.

176
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:52,339
I was very afraid.  I thought:

177
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,926
"Oh god, what if the
water is still wetter?

178
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:58,220
How do I get my sister out of here? "

179
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,559
I can't swim, and
neither can she.

180
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:07,896
I said to her that if
we drown, it would be

181
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:09,981
best in our sleep,
then we wouldn't notice.

182
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:21,576
I didn't know the weather
anymore, you understand?

183
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,248
I just sat on a stone.

184
01:00:53,859 --> 01:00:57,571
And then I went to our
house with my sister.

185
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:01,032
And this was...

186
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,290
To see how the place
where you were born...

187
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:12,460
I do not know either,

188
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:19,968
it just hurt a
lot to see it all.

189
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:46,286
It hit me very much.

190
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:50,874
I thought I was going crazy.

191
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:01,051
That was her furniture, her favorite room.

192
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:04,846
Your memories, the
photo of my uncle...

193
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:08,516
It was a place she loved very much.

194
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:13,063
Here she always sat and
watched TV, on the rocking chair.

195
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:19,653
Here she cleaned the rice,

196
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,155
with the door open to have enough light.

197
01:02:22,948 --> 01:02:27,619
Now she only has her bedroom.

198
01:02:29,788 --> 01:02:31,957
She's getting bitter and bitter.

199
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,542
More and more sad.

200
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:39,339
She loses all her courage to face life.

201
01:03:17,329 --> 01:03:18,830
Be careful not to slip!

202
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:22,090
We were lucky it
was just the roof.

203
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:23,216
It's correct.

204
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,759
We'll fix it quickly.

205
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:51,661
Just see

206
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:57,959
everything broken.

207
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:03,089
Don't worry, let's replant.

208
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:24,754
I now only find
the sea terrible.

209
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:29,384
It devoured so
many stable houses.

210
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:35,223
It's a monster

211
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:36,766
i'm afraid

212
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:41,438
I will never go to the
beach and bathe again.

213
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:50,835
Look, look:

214
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:53,504
One, two...

215
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:56,966
-Yes!
-Wow.

216
01:16:30,878 --> 01:16:35,216
This cyclone did
a great miracle.

217
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:39,470
My friends, the plants
that were vegetating on the

218
01:16:39,553 --> 01:16:41,555
ground down here began to
sprout up after the hurricane.

219
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:46,769
Some have waited 40 years.

220
01:17:00,241 --> 01:17:01,534
How old is the Yunque?

221
01:17:02,368 --> 01:17:03,994
30 million years!

222
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,705
How many hurricanes
have passed through here?

223
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:11,001
Well, by our calculation, about 15,000.

224
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:22,847
A hurricane is as important to
the Yunque as light and water.

225
01:17:34,692 --> 01:17:38,070
I understand that the misery, the chaos,

226
01:17:38,279 --> 01:17:41,365
that a storm leaves
like a hurricane

227
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:45,536
put people in fear and terror.

228
01:17:45,786 --> 01:17:48,873
But a hurricane also
rearranges things; it

229
01:17:48,956 --> 01:17:52,293
can also be a blessing,
not just a curse.

230
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:56,422
Of course, sometimes you wish

231
01:17:57,298 --> 01:18:00,843
that the circumstances would be different

232
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:04,680
And tomorrow will be a better day
