00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:38,499
Hello

2
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,749
Yes?

3
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:44,874
What?

4
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,790
Sir, kindly switch off your
mobile phone

5
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,040
Just one sec, please

6
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:21,457
Excuse me

7
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:22,790
Sir, please sit down

8
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,624
Captain, there's a
medical emergency

9
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,540
A passenger has just
fallen down in the aisle

10
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:39,540
Delhi, Air India 101 returning
due to medical emergency

11
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,415
Excuse me, sir

12
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:02,999
Hold on!

13
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:16,707
I'm fine now, thanks.
Carry on, please

14
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,540
Wait

15
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,249
Get the car!
- Mr. Dhillon?

16
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,790
Want the name tattooed?
Get the car

17
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:58,790
To the hotel, sir?

18
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,665
Yes, yes, but via Vasant Vihar

19
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,499
Step on the gas, dude!

20
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,290
Yeah, Farhan?

21
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,915
Get ready. I'll pick you up
in five minutes

22
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,124
What happened?

23
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,165
Chatur called. Remember him?

24
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,207
The 'Silencer'?

25
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,290
Yeah

26
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,832
He said Rancho is coming

27
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:34,957
What?

28
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:38,832
He said - Come to the campus at 8.
On the tank

29
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,374
Oh shucks!

30
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,415
Hurry!

31
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,749
Ok

32
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,040
Honey, I'll be back soon.
Oh, shoes

33
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,124
We found our buddy

34
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:57,749
What?

35
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,124
Tell me later - bye

36
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,457
You forgot your pants

37
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:13,874
Now to the hotel, sir?

38
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,082
Yes, but via
Imperial College of Engineering

39
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:18,582
Ok sir

40
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:19,624
Forgot my socks

41
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,540
More than just your socks

42
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,415
Your pants

43
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:24,540
Oh no

44
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:40,249
Now get my brother
from the airport

45
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,582
Same last name - Dhillon

46
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,332
This is Dhillon.
Where's my cab? On the runway?

47
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:06,707
Hey Rancho

48
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,499
Hey Chatur, where's Rancho?

49
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,457
Rancho

50
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,290
Where's Rancho?

51
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,999
Welcome, idiots

52
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,707
Some 'madeira' for you?

53
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:25,457
The same rum you
guzzled those days

54
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,374
Have a drink

55
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,249
Where is Rancho?

56
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:32,790
Patience. First look at this

57
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:37,457
Don't eye my wife. Check out
the mansion behind, idiots

58
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,707
$ 3.5 million

59
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,832
Swimming pool - heated!

60
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,124
Living room - maple wood flooring

61
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:49,999
My new Lambhorghini 6496 cc -

62
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:51,790
very fast

63
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,957
Why're you showing us all this?

64
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,499
Forgot?

65
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,624
What's this?

66
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,040
'5th September'. Today's date

67
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,665
I challenge you

68
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,082
We'll meet again after ten years

69
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,457
Same day. Same place

70
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,707
We'll see who's more successful

71
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:34,790
Have the balls? C'mon, bet!

72
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:40,457
Remember? I'd challenged
that idiot right here

73
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:44,082
I kept my promise. I'm back

74
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:48,874
Jackass! I aborted a flight,
he forgot his pants

75
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,082
all to meet Rancho

76
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,124
5 years we've searched.
Don't know if he's alive

77
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,915
and you think he'll show up
for your silly bet

78
00:07:56,125 --> 00:08:00,249
I know he won't show up

79
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,749
You gonna break his jaw
or should I

80
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:05,957
So why'd you call us here?

81
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,332
To meet Rancho

82
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,874
Come and see where I've reached
and where he rots

83
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,415
So you know where Rancho is?

84
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,582
Yes

85
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:18,957
Where?

86
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,999
He is in Shimla

87
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:33,457
Free as the wind was he

88
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:40,290
Like a soaring kite was he

89
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:48,290
Where did he go... let's find him

90
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:06,499
Free as the wind was he

91
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,707
Like a soaring kite was he

92
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:17,207
Where did he go... let's find him

93
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,582
We were led by the path we took

94
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,957
While he carved a path of his own

95
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:32,540
Stumbling, rising, carefree walked he

96
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,290
We fretted about the morrow

97
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,665
He simply reveled in today

98
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:46,624
Living each moment to the fullest

99
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:51,207
Where did he come from...

100
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,540
He who touched our
hearts and vanished...

101
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:05,165
Where did he go... let's find him

102
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:15,040
In scorching Sun,
he was like a patch of shade...

103
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:18,415
In an endless desert, like an oasis...

104
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:23,415
On a bruised heart,
like soothing balm was he

105
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,707
Afraid, we stayed confined in the well

106
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:32,040
Fearless, he frolicked in the river

107
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:37,749
Never hesitating to swim
against the tide

108
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:42,707
He wandered lonesome as a cloud

109
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:47,874
... Yet he was our dearest friend

110
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:53,040
Where did he go... let's find him

111
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,249
Rancho

112
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,832
Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad

113
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,790
He was as unique as his name

114
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,332
From birth we were taught -
Life is a race

115
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,790
Run fast or you'll be trampled

116
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:12,332
Even to be born, one had to race
300 million sperms

117
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:18,207
1978. I was born at 5.15 pm

118
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,457
At 5.16, my father announced

119
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:26,165
My son will be an engineer.
- Farhan Qureshi. B.Tech. Engineer

120
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,790
And my fate was sealed

121
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:33,290
What I wanted to be... no one asked

122
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,165
Raju Rastogi...
Ranchhoddas Chanchad

123
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:00,832
Room number?

124
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:04,707
D-26

125
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,415
C'mon

126
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,374
I'm Man Mohan. MM

127
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,374
These engineers call me
Millimeter

128
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,040
For eggs, bread, milk, laundry

129
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,915
finishing journals,
copying assignments

130
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:19,665
I'm your guy. Fixed rates.
No bargaining

131
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,832
Hey wait, hold this

132
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:28,124
Meet Kilobyte, Megabyte
and their mother Gigabyte

133
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,207
Go ahead, click -
this family doesn't bite

134
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,749
Check him out...
another God-fearing soul

135
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,749
Hi. Farhan Qureshi
- I'm Raju Rastogi

136
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,249
Don't worry

137
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:55,665
a few days here and
he'll lose faith in God

138
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,624
Then naked babes will be
on the wall, and he'll say -

139
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:03,124
Oh God,
give me one chance with her

140
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:04,874
Get out of here

141
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,749
Four bucks. Two per bag

142
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,707
Here's five. Keep the change

143
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:16,165
Thanks boss. For your tip,
here's one in return -

144
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,332
Wear your best underwear tonight

145
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,790
Why?

146
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:28,415
Your Majesty, thou art great

147
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,624
Accept this humble offering

148
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,749
Ha... here's a He-Man

149
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,457
What a pretty piece.
Cute and compact

150
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,249
A campus tradition - On Day 1...

151
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,957
Freshmen must pay
their respects to Seniors

152
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,332
in their underwear.

153
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,874
This is when we first saw Rancho

154
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,332
Spiderman

155
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:01,749
Batman

156
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:11,290
Fresh meat

157
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,874
Greetings.
Drop your pants, get stamped

158
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:15,832
Name?

159
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,665
'Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad'

160
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,832
What a mouthful!
Needs serious cramming

161
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:23,624
Come on - pants off

162
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,957
Being stubborn?

163
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,915
Wet pants not good, kiddo.
Take them off

164
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,082
Aal izz well
- What's that?

165
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,832
Aal izz Well

166
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:41,832
What did he say?

167
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:45,165
Someone tell him.
Hey James Bond

168
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:46,499
Make him understand

169
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,415
Take off your pants or
they are going to piss on you

170
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,082
Hey 007!
Ashamed to speak Hindi?

171
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:56,749
Sorry sir, I was born in Uganda,
studied in Pondicherry

172
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,290
so little slow in Hindi

173
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,582
So explain slowly. No hurry

174
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:04,999
Feeling cold?

175
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,790
Pray undress

176
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:12,957
or he'll do
'urine-expulsion' on you

177
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,874
Calls pissing 'urine-expulsion'!

178
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,749
A true linguist
in the land of engineers!

179
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,957
Hey, come out of there

180
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,499
Come out or...

181
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:40,790
or I'll do 'urine-expulsion'
on your door

182
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,332
If you aren't out by
the count of ten

183
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:57,665
I'll do 'urine-expulsion'
on your door all semester

184
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,457
One

185
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,915
Two

186
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,415
Three

187
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,290
Four

188
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,499
Five

189
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,040
Six

190
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,540
Seven

191
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,165
Eight

192
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,499
Nine

193
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,207
Ten

194
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,540
Salt water is a great conductor
of electricity. 8th Grade Physics

195
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,749
We had studied it.
He applied it

196
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,999
Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe
was the Director of ICE

197
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,499
Students called him Virus,
computer Virus

198
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,457
Virus on the way, with eggs

199
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:24,249
Freshmen are summoned.
Come quickly

200
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:27,124
Virus was the most competitive
man we had ever seen

201
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:31,499
He couldn't bear anyone
getting ahead of him

202
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:38,499
To save time,
his shirts had Velcro

203
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,165
and his ties had hooks

204
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:46,749
He'd trained his mind to write
with both hands simultaneously

205
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:54,457
Everyday at 2 pm he took a
7 1/2 minute power nap

206
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,124
with an opera as lullaby

207
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,790
Govind, his valet, had instructions

208
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,040
to carry out all unproductive tasks
such as shaving, nail-cutting etc

209
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,624
What is this?
- Sir, nest

210
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,040
Whose?
- A koel bird's nest, sir

211
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,124
Wrong

212
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,040
A koel bird never makes
her own nest

213
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,582
She lays her eggs in
other nests

214
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,457
And when they hatch,
what do they do?

215
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:49,040
They push the other eggs
out of the nest

216
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,999
Competition over

217
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:58,874
Their life begins with murder.
That's nature

218
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,290
Compete or die

219
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:06,374
You also are like the koel birds

220
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:15,082
And these are the eggs
you smashed to get into ICE

221
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:20,540
Don't forget, ICE gets
400,000 applications a year

222
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:25,082
and only 200 are selected - You!

223
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:30,332
And these? Finished.
Broken eggs

224
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,957
My son... he tried for three years

225
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,374
Rejected. Every time

226
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,332
Remember, life is a race

227
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,582
If you don't run fast,
you'll get trampled

228
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,165
Let me tell you a
very interesting story

229
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:53,707
This is an astronaut pen

230
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,624
Fountain pens and ballpoint pens
don't work in outer space

231
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:02,707
So scientists spent
millions to invent this pen

232
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:07,374
It can write at any angle, in any
temperature, in zero gravity

233
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,540
One day, when I was a student

234
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,582
the Director of our institute
called me

235
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,290
He said, 'Viru Sahastrabuddhe.'
I said, 'Yes sir'

236
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,874
'Come here!'
I got scared

237
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,457
He showed me this pen

238
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,207
He said, 'This is a
symbol of excellence'

239
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,040
'I give it to you'

240
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:30,790
'When you come across an
extraordinary student like yourself

241
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,082
...pass it onto him'

242
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:38,499
For 32 years, I've been
waiting for that student

243
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,040
But no luck

244
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,874
Anyone here, who'll strive
to win this pen?

245
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,582
Good.
Put your hands down

246
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,665
Shall I post it on the notice board?
Hands down

247
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,457
One question, sir

248
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:03,415
Sir, if pens didn't work
in outer space

249
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,582
why didn't the astronauts
use a pencil?

250
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:09,499
They'd have saved millions

251
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,957
I will get back to you on this

252
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,249
He zaps a Senior's privates
at night

253
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:33,707
fingers the Director in the day.
Best avoid him

254
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:35,957
You deflated Virus's erection

255
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:39,999
Your Majesty, thou art great.
Accept this humble offering

256
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,582
Buzz off.
You don't have school?

257
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,499
Who'll pay for it? Your pop?

258
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:47,915
Keep off my dad!
- Relax

259
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:51,915
For school you don't need
tuition money, just a uniform

260
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:57,540
Pick a school,
buy the uniform, slip into class

261
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,832
In that sea of kids,
no one will notice

262
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:03,249
If I get caught?
- Then new uniform, new school

263
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:05,624
See that?
- He was different...

264
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:09,290
He challenged conventions
at every stage

265
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:12,624
A free-spirited bird had
landed in Virus's nest

266
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:16,415
We were robots, blindly following
our professors' commands

267
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,665
He was the only one
who was not a machine

268
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:22,290
What is a machine?

269
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,249
Why're you smiling?

270
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:33,457
Sir, to study Engineering
was a childhood dream

271
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,749
I'm so happy to be here finally

272
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,165
No need to be so happy.
Define a machine

273
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:45,999
A machine is anything that
reduces human effort

274
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:47,790
Will you please elaborate?

275
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:56,582
Anything that simplifies work,
or saves time, is a machine

276
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:00,749
It's a warm day, press a button,
get a blast of air

277
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,207
The fan... A machine!

278
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,999
Speak to a friend miles away.
The telephone... A machine!

279
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:09,249
Compute millions in seconds.
The calculator... A machine!

280
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,957
We're surrounded by machines

281
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,999
From a pen's nib to a pants' zip -
all machines

282
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,832
Up and down in a second.
Up, down, up, down...

283
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,124
What is the definition?

284
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:24,540
I just gave it to you, sir

285
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:29,749
You'll write this in the exam?
This is a machine - up, down...

286
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:32,540
Idiot! Anybody else?

287
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,124
Yes?

288
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:36,790
Sir, machines are any combination
of bodies so connected

289
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,457
that their relative motions
are constrained

290
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:40,999
and by which means, force
and motion may be transmitted

291
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:43,415
and modified as a screw
and its nut, or a lever arranged

292
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:46,207
to turn about a fulcrum
or a pulley about its pivot, etc

293
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:48,415
especially, a construction,
more or less complex

294
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,415
consisting of a combination
of moving parts, or

295
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,832
simple mechanical elements,
as wheels, levers, cams etc

296
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:56,124
Wonderful

297
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:57,874
Perfect. Please sit down

298
00:24:58,125 --> 00:24:59,457
Thank you

299
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,874
But sir, I said the same thing,
in simple language

300
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:08,040
If you prefer simple language,
join an Arts and Commerce college

301
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:10,040
But sir, one must get
the meaning too

302
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:13,665
What's the point of blindly
cramming a bookish definition

303
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:15,540
You think you're smarter
than the book?

304
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:20,874
Write the textbook definition, mister,
if you want to pass

305
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:22,790
But there are other books...
- Get out!

306
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:25,082
Why?

307
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,290
In simple language - Out!

308
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:38,082
Idiot!

309
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:42,624
So, we were discussing
the machine...

310
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:45,165
Why're you back?

311
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:47,374
I forgot something

312
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,874
What?

313
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,332
Instruments that record,
analyze, summarize, organize

314
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:54,749
debate and explain information;
that are illustrated, non-illustrated

315
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:56,790
hard-bound, paperback,
jacketed, non jacketed

316
00:25:56,958 --> 00:25:58,915
with foreword, introduction,
table-of-contents, index

317
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,832
that are intended for the
enlightenment, understanding

318
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,665
enrichment, enhancement and
education of the human brain

319
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:04,915
through the sensory route of
vision, sometimes touch

320
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,707
What do you mean?

321
00:26:12,958 --> 00:26:14,249
Books, sir

322
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:17,207
I forgot my books. May I?

323
00:26:17,583 --> 00:26:19,249
Couldn't you ask simply?

324
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:22,874
I tried earlier, sir.
It simply didn't work

325
00:26:28,416 --> 00:26:31,999
Professors kept Rancho
mostly out... seldom in

326
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:35,249
When thrown out of one class,
he'd slip into another

327
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:39,707
He said - First year or fourth year,
it's knowledge. Just grab it

328
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,499
He was unlike any of us

329
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:44,124
We fought for a shower
every morning

330
00:26:44,708 --> 00:26:46,957
He'd bathe wherever
he found water

331
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:47,999
Morning, sir

332
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,707
Machines were his passion

333
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:56,249
When he spotted them,
he opened them

334
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:57,582
Some he could re-assemble...

335
00:26:58,666 --> 00:26:59,999
some he couldn't

336
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:03,374
There was another, just like him

337
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,415
Joy Lobo

338
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:09,874
Sir. Excuse me, sir

339
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,957
Mr. Joy Lobo!

340
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:15,290
Sir, if I could know the
convocation dates...

341
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:16,249
Why?

342
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:18,165
Dad wants to make
train reservations

343
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:22,040
I'm the first engineer from my
village. Everyone wants to attend

344
00:27:22,916 --> 00:27:25,124
In that case, call your dad

345
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:27,707
Please hurry up.
Don't waste my time

346
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:35,165
Hello

347
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:38,332
Dad, the Director wants to
speak to you

348
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,499
Joy!

349
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:42,124
Mr. Lobo, your son won't
graduate this year

350
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:44,624
What happened, sir?

351
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:46,874
He has violated all deadlines

352
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:50,957
Mr. Lobo, it's an unrealistic project

353
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:52,999
He is making some
nonsense helicopter

354
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:57,915
I suggest you don't book
your tickets. I'm so sorry

355
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:02,540
Sir, I am this close, sir
- Is your project ready?

356
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:06,915
Is your project ready?
- Sir, see it once, please

357
00:28:07,041 --> 00:28:08,665
Submit it, and we'll consider

358
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:11,165
Sir, a small extension...
- Why, why should I?

359
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:14,374
After dad's stroke,
I couldn't focus for two months

360
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,749
Did you stop eating?

361
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:17,290
No

362
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,415
Stopped bathing?

363
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:20,457
So why stop studying?

364
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:23,290
Sir, I'm very close.
See it once, please...

365
00:28:23,416 --> 00:28:24,582
Mr. Lobo!

366
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:27,790
Sunday afternoon, my son
fell off a train and died

367
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,040
Monday morning, I taught a class.
So don't give me that nonsense

368
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:38,207
I can give you sympathy,
not an extension

369
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,874
Sir... I'm very close...

370
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,957
Lifelong I lived

371
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:15,374
The life of another

372
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:17,874
For just one moment

373
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:20,624
Let me live as I...

374
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:22,790
Lifelong I lived

375
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:25,290
The life of another

376
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:27,582
For just one moment

377
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:30,415
Let me live as I...

378
00:29:40,541 --> 00:29:45,082
Give me some sunshine
Give me some rain

379
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:50,290
Give me another chance
I wanna grow up once again

380
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:54,915
Give me some sunshine
Give me some rain

381
00:29:55,250 --> 00:30:00,999
Give me another chance
I wanna grow up once again

382
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:03,457
Dude's come up with an
amazing design

383
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:05,290
A wireless camera atop a helicopter

384
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:09,790
Can be used for
traffic updates, security... Wow!

385
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:13,082
But Virus said it's an
impractical design, it won't fly

386
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,374
It will fly! We'll make it fly

387
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:19,874
Don't tell Joy. It'll be a surprise

388
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:22,915
We'll fly it up to his window
and capture his reaction

389
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,624
If we work on his project,
who'll work on ours?

390
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:29,207
Tests, vivas, quizzes -
42 exams per semester

391
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:31,040
You scare easily, bro

392
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:36,665
Take your hand, put it over your
heart, and say, 'Aal izz well'

393
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:39,040
All is well?
- Aal izz well

394
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:41,707
Words of wisdom from
His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas

395
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:44,332
We had an old watchman
in our village

396
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:50,415
On night patrol, he'd call out,
'Aal izz well'

397
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:54,540
And we slept peacefully.
Then there was a theft

398
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:56,790
and we learned that
he couldn't see at night!

399
00:30:57,083 --> 00:31:00,540
He'd just yell 'Aal izz well',
and we felt secure

400
00:31:02,416 --> 00:31:06,999
That day I understood
this heart scares easily

401
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:09,832
You have to trick it

402
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:16,790
However big the problem,
tell your heart, 'All is well, pal'

403
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:19,749
That resolves the problem?

404
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,790
No. But you gain courage to face it

405
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:27,665
Learn it up, bro.
We're gonna really need it here

406
00:31:45,416 --> 00:31:49,790
When life spins out of control
Just let your lips roll

407
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:57,707
Let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

408
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:05,499
When life spins out of control
Just let your lips roll

409
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:09,457
Just let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

410
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:13,540
Yell - All is Well...

411
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:16,832
The chicken's clueless
about the egg's fate

412
00:32:17,416 --> 00:32:20,832
Will it hatch or
become an omelette

413
00:32:21,666 --> 00:32:24,832
No one knows
what the future holds

414
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:27,457
So let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

415
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:31,957
Whistle away the toll
Yell - All is Well

416
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:36,040
Hey bro - All is Well

417
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:40,415
Hey mate - All is Well

418
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:44,415
Hey bro - All is Well

419
00:32:53,666 --> 00:32:57,415
Confusion and more confusion
No sign of any solution

420
00:32:57,625 --> 00:33:01,582
Ah... finally a solution
But wait... what was the question?

421
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:04,749
If the timid heart with fear
is about to die

422
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:08,832
Then con it bro,
with this simple lie

423
00:33:09,375 --> 00:33:12,749
Heart's an idiot,
it will fall under that spell

424
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:15,457
Let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

425
00:33:15,666 --> 00:33:19,790
Whistle away the toll
Yell - All is Well

426
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,207
Hey bro - All is Well

427
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:28,082
Hey mate - All is Well

428
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:31,999
Hey bro - All is Well

429
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:45,457
Blew the scholarship on booze
But that did not dispel my blues

430
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:49,415
Holy incense lit up my plight
And yet God's nowhere in sight

431
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,749
The lamb is clueless for
what it's destined

432
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:56,790
Will it be served on skewers
or simply minced

433
00:33:57,458 --> 00:34:00,832
No one knows
what the future holds

434
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:03,374
So let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

435
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:07,957
Whistle away the toll
Yell - All is Well

436
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:11,832
Hey bro - All is Well

437
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:15,665
Hey mate - All is Well

438
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,957
Hey bro - All is Well

439
00:34:21,416 --> 00:34:25,415
When life spins out of control
Just let your lips roll

440
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:31,707
Just let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

441
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:35,415
All is Well

442
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:38,582
The chicken's clueless
about the egg's fate

443
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:42,790
Will it hatch or
become an omelette

444
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:46,582
No one knows
what the future holds

445
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,457
So let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

446
00:34:49,541 --> 00:34:51,082
Whistle away the toll

447
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:53,290
Eureka! Eureka!

448
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:57,999
Yell - All is Well

449
00:34:58,958 --> 00:35:02,124
Hey Mrs. Chicken - All is Well

450
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:05,957
Hey Mr. Lamb - All is Well

451
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:09,999
Hey bro - All is Well

452
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:12,249
Hey, take it up to Joy's window

453
00:35:12,916 --> 00:35:13,999
Take it higher

454
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:16,499
Look at Silencer - the nude dude!

455
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:21,499
Joy, come out

456
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:25,082
Come to the window

457
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:26,665
Joy, look outside

458
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,874
Good news, sir

459
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:26,249
The police and Joy's father
have no clue

460
00:36:27,541 --> 00:36:28,874
Everyone thinks this is suicide

461
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:32,290
The post mortem report -

462
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:34,915
Cause of Death: Intense
pressure on windpipe

463
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:36,124
resulting in choking

464
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:42,832
All think the pressure
on the jugular killed him

465
00:36:44,541 --> 00:36:47,499
What about the mental pressure
for the last four years?

466
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:49,374
That's missing in the report

467
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:53,999
Engineers are a clever bunch

468
00:36:55,458 --> 00:36:58,790
They haven't made a machine
to measure mental pressure

469
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,582
If they had, all would know...

470
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:05,207
this isn't suicide... it's murder

471
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:13,332
How dare you blame me
for Joy's suicide?

472
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:17,040
If one student can't handle
pressure, is it our fault?

473
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:21,124
Life is full of pressures.
Will you always blame others?

474
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:25,374
I don't blame you, sir.
I blame the system

475
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:30,999
Look at these statistics -
India ranks No.1 in suicides

476
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:35,082
Every 90 minutes,
a student attempts suicide

477
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:39,665
Suicide is a bigger killer
than disease

478
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:41,207
Something's terribly wrong, sir

479
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:43,582
I can't speak for the rest

480
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,207
but this is one of the
finest colleges in the country

481
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:48,874
I've run this place for 32 years

482
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:52,665
We were ranked 28th.
Now we're No.1

483
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:54,415
What's the point, sir?

484
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,415
Here they don't discuss
new ideas or inventions

485
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:06,124
They discuss grades,
jobs, settling in the USA

486
00:38:07,416 --> 00:38:12,332
They teach how to get good scores.
They don't teach Engineering

487
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,707
Now you will teach me
how to teach?

488
00:38:15,166 --> 00:38:16,082
No sir, I...

489
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:20,415
Sir, my paper...

490
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:40,415
Vaidyanathan, please sit down

491
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:44,082
Here is a
self-proclaimed professor

492
00:38:44,541 --> 00:38:49,249
who thinks he is better than
our highly qualified teachers

493
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:54,415
Professor Ranchhoddas Chanchad
will teach us Engineering

494
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:14,665
We do not have all day

495
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:55,874
You have 30 seconds
to define these terms

496
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:58,332
You may refer to your books

497
00:39:58,916 --> 00:40:00,957
Raise your hand
if you get the answer

498
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:05,624
Let's see who comes first,
who comes last

499
00:40:06,458 --> 00:40:09,707
Your time starts... now

500
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:40,249
Time up

501
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:43,790
Time up, sir

502
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:48,040
No one got the answer?

503
00:40:50,541 --> 00:40:53,915
Now rewind your life by a minute

504
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:57,957
When I asked this question,
were you excited? Curious?

505
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:00,874
Thrilled that you'd learn
something new?

506
00:41:01,666 --> 00:41:04,082
Anyone? ... Sir?

507
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,832
No. You all got into a frantic race

508
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:13,999
What's the use of such methods,
even if you come first

509
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:19,624
Will your knowledge increase?
No, just the pressure

510
00:41:20,541 --> 00:41:22,082
This is a college,
not a pressure cooker

511
00:41:24,291 --> 00:41:27,832
Even a circus lion learns to sit
on a chair in fear of the whip

512
00:41:28,916 --> 00:41:32,415
But you call such a lion
'well trained', not 'well educated'

513
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,457
Hello!

514
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:38,540
This is not a philosophy class.
Just explain those two words

515
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:40,624
Sir, these words don't exist

516
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:45,124
These are my friends' names.
Farhan and Raju

517
00:41:57,666 --> 00:41:58,582
Quiet!

518
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:02,915
Nonsense! Is this how
you'll teach Engineering?

519
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:05,290
Sir, I wasn't teaching
you Engineering

520
00:42:05,875 --> 00:42:07,374
You're an expert at that

521
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:11,457
I was teaching you... how to teach

522
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:16,207
And I'm sure one day you'll learn

523
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:20,207
because unlike you, I never
abandon my weak students

524
00:42:20,708 --> 00:42:21,707
Bye, sir

525
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:24,874
Quiet!

526
00:42:27,416 --> 00:42:28,540
Quiet, I said

527
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,374
I regret to inform you
that your son...

528
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,624
Farhan...
Raju...

529
00:42:36,875 --> 00:42:37,957
has fallen into bad company

530
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:41,457
Without urgent corrective steps,
his future will be ruined

531
00:42:42,541 --> 00:42:45,832
Virus's letters dropped on
our homes like atom bombs

532
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:48,582
Hiroshima and Nagasaki
plunged into gloom

533
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:51,749
Our parents invited us -
for a dressing down

534
00:42:52,791 --> 00:42:54,957
Come in

535
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,457
See that?

536
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:02,415
We could afford
just one air-conditioner

537
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:07,832
We put it in Farhan's room,
so he could study in comfort

538
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:13,249
I didn't buy a car.
I manage with a scooter

539
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:15,999
We put all our money
into Farhan's education

540
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:21,624
We sacrificed our comforts
for Farhan's future. Understand?

541
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,624
You took these pictures, Farhan?

542
00:43:33,541 --> 00:43:35,540
He had that useless
obsession for a while

543
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,165
Went around taking
pictures of animals

544
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:41,040
Wanted to be a
wildlife photographer

545
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,665
Son, what was your
score that year?

546
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:46,832
91%

547
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:51,832
Hear that? Straight drop
from 94% to 91%

548
00:43:54,958 --> 00:43:56,415
You find it funny?

549
00:43:57,083 --> 00:44:01,165
No sir, sorry. I'm just
amazed at the photos

550
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:03,957
Why make him an engineer...
Why not a wildlife photographer?

551
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:05,290
Enough!

552
00:44:06,541 --> 00:44:11,832
I humbly request you -
Don't ruin my son's future

553
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:15,707
Food's on the table, boys. C'mon

554
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:22,915
If you ever visit again,
do eat with us

555
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:27,290
Dad denied us a meal...

556
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:29,540
So, to fill our bellies with food...

557
00:44:29,916 --> 00:44:33,207
and ears with more reprimands,
we reached Raju's house

558
00:44:35,166 --> 00:44:39,249
Raju's house was straight
out of a 50's black and white film

559
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:40,999
A small, dingy room...

560
00:44:41,166 --> 00:44:42,665
a paralyzed father...

561
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:44,665
a coughing mother...

562
00:44:45,041 --> 00:44:46,540
and an unwed sister

563
00:44:47,666 --> 00:44:49,040
A sofa sprouting springs...

564
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,790
a 24 hour water supply -
from the leaking roof

565
00:44:52,458 --> 00:44:56,082
Mother was a retired school
teacher and a tireless complainer

566
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:58,915
Father was once a postmaster

567
00:44:59,416 --> 00:45:01,832
Paralysis shut down
his body partly...

568
00:45:02,291 --> 00:45:04,707
his salary completely.
And the sister...

569
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:08,499
Kammo's turned 28.
They demand a car in dowry

570
00:45:09,125 --> 00:45:11,749
If you don't study and earn,
how will she marry?

571
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:13,165
Some okra?

572
00:45:14,166 --> 00:45:18,040
Okra is now 12/- per kilo,
cauliflower is 10/-

573
00:45:18,375 --> 00:45:19,790
It's daylight robbery!

574
00:45:20,166 --> 00:45:24,165
What will we eat if we get
warnings from your college?

575
00:45:24,416 --> 00:45:25,332
Mom!

576
00:45:26,916 --> 00:45:27,874
Cottage cheese?

577
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:31,874
Cottage cheese should be sold
at the jewelers, in velvet pouches

578
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:33,957
Cottage cheese?
- No, no, it's ok

579
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:36,165
Mom, please

580
00:45:37,041 --> 00:45:38,832
Alright, I'll shut up

581
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:44,999
Earn for the family,
slave like a maid

582
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:47,499
and then take the vow of silence

583
00:45:48,458 --> 00:45:52,999
If not with my son, with whom
do I share my woes - his friends?

584
00:45:56,916 --> 00:45:57,999
Hey Raju

585
00:46:01,541 --> 00:46:02,582
We were in a huge dilemma

586
00:46:03,208 --> 00:46:06,332
Do we comfort our friend
or console his mom?

587
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:10,499
Screw it, we thought, let's
focus on the cottage cheese

588
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:25,249
Even his eczema cream
costs 55/- now

589
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,332
Another roti?

590
00:46:31,666 --> 00:46:34,624
No, thank you. We're through

591
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:44,999
Okra for 12/-
- Cauliflower for 10/-

592
00:46:48,041 --> 00:46:49,874
At least you were offered a meal

593
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:53,582
Unlike your sadistic dad...
'Hitler' Qureshi!

594
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:56,415
And your mom is Mother Teresa...
Feeding us 'eczema roti'!

595
00:46:56,666 --> 00:47:00,249
Don't poke fun at my mom!
- Enough, you guys

596
00:47:00,541 --> 00:47:01,957
I'm famished. Let's eat out

597
00:47:02,083 --> 00:47:04,457
It's month end. Who'll pay?
His Mother Teresa?

598
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:10,082
To eat out, you don't need money.
Just a uniform. Look...

599
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:14,540
C'mon
- Come

600
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:18,374
Good evening,
good evening

601
00:47:18,458 --> 00:47:19,332
Oh, Uncle

602
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:27,874
Three large vodkas.
- Half soda, half water

603
00:47:28,083 --> 00:47:29,332
If we're caught, we're dead

604
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,040
What's for starters?
- Get double portions

605
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:35,165
Leave this here and start
some peppy music

606
00:47:35,916 --> 00:47:37,582
Pia, what the hell!

607
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:40,665
Why're you wearing
this ancient piece of junk?

608
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:45,457
What'll people say - My fiancee...

609
00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:48,457
a doctor in the making,
wearing a cheap, 200/- watch!

610
00:47:49,375 --> 00:47:50,874
Please take it off. Thank you

611
00:47:51,416 --> 00:47:52,457
Hi handsome

612
00:47:52,583 --> 00:47:55,415
Hey Aunty.
You're looking good

613
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,082
Don't miss my set, darling
- Rubies?

614
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,874
From Mandalay
- Mandalay... Wow!

615
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:03,665
Hey, let's go meet David
- Of course

616
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:07,915
Excuse me

617
00:48:10,083 --> 00:48:11,249
Yes?

618
00:48:11,541 --> 00:48:12,624
Flowers

619
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:17,332
May I take the glass?
- Why?

620
00:48:17,625 --> 00:48:19,915
So you don't break it on my head

621
00:48:20,708 --> 00:48:21,957
Why would I do that?

622
00:48:22,375 --> 00:48:24,499
For the free advice I'll now impart

623
00:48:25,666 --> 00:48:26,540
What?

624
00:48:26,875 --> 00:48:28,457
Don't marry that ass

625
00:48:29,541 --> 00:48:30,457
Excuse me?

626
00:48:30,666 --> 00:48:32,374
He's not a human,
he's a price tag

627
00:48:32,791 --> 00:48:35,790
He'll turn your life into a
nightmare of brands and prices

628
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:38,999
He'll ruin your life.
Your future will be finished

629
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,165
Want a demonstration?

630
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:43,957
Shall I find out
the price of his shoes?

631
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,415
I won't ask.
He'll announce it himself

632
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:05,415
What the hell...
Mint sauce on my $300 shoes!

633
00:49:05,541 --> 00:49:08,749
Run for your life!
It's free advice. Take it or leave it

634
00:49:09,291 --> 00:49:11,999
Genuine Italian leather -
hand-stitched!

635
00:49:16,583 --> 00:49:19,290
Dad, are they your guests?

636
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:25,915
My students.
What're they doing here?

637
00:49:29,875 --> 00:49:31,082
Hold on, Dad

638
00:49:32,625 --> 00:49:34,874
These beans smell great

639
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,332
No room for roti
- Just pile it on

640
00:49:39,291 --> 00:49:40,665
Hi
- Hey

641
00:49:42,208 --> 00:49:45,207
That was an eye-opener.
Thank you so much

642
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:48,999
It was my moral responsibility

643
00:49:49,791 --> 00:49:51,207
Can I ask you for little more help?

644
00:49:52,291 --> 00:49:54,915
Dad won't let me break off
this engagement

645
00:49:55,875 --> 00:49:59,874
You explain so well.
Can you give him a demo too?

646
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:02,790
Certainly.
Raju, the mint sauce

647
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,790
You're really sweet

648
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,082
Where is your daddy?
- Right behind you

649
00:50:13,708 --> 00:50:16,040
Aal izz well

650
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:21,999
Run for your life!
It's free advice. Take it or leave it

651
00:50:22,291 --> 00:50:23,832
What're you doing here?

652
00:50:24,458 --> 00:50:27,582
We'll hand these gifts
to the couple

653
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,915
I'll do that for you.
It's my sister's wedding

654
00:50:31,333 --> 00:50:32,499
Sister?

655
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:37,749
Sir, what's the sum total
of your daughters?

656
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:40,207
Empty. No gift cheques

657
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:42,624
Forgot the cheques, Raju
... Farhan?

658
00:50:42,708 --> 00:50:46,874
We didn't invite you,
you must be from the groom's side

659
00:50:47,375 --> 00:50:51,332
No sir, we're here as the
emissaries of science

660
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:53,665
How? Can you explain?

661
00:50:53,916 --> 00:50:57,582
Dad, he explains superbly.
I'm sure he'll give us a demo

662
00:50:57,875 --> 00:50:58,832
Won't you?

663
00:50:59,666 --> 00:51:03,249
Well, Delhi has plenty of
power cuts that...

664
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,832
disrupt wedding celebrations

665
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:08,290
So I thought of making
an inverter that...

666
00:51:08,416 --> 00:51:10,832
draws power from guests' cars

667
00:51:11,041 --> 00:51:12,415
I see

668
00:51:12,625 --> 00:51:14,124
Wow

669
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,915
So where's the inverter?

670
00:51:16,708 --> 00:51:18,332
Sir, the design is ready

671
00:51:21,416 --> 00:51:22,707
Where's the design, Farhan?

672
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:26,165
I gave you the design
- I gave it to Raju

673
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:27,540
Raju, design?

674
00:51:30,625 --> 00:51:34,374
Never mind the design.
I'll make the inverter and show you

675
00:51:34,708 --> 00:51:38,374
You can only invent stories,
not an inverter

676
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:41,749
I'll make one, I promise

677
00:51:42,083 --> 00:51:45,582
And I'll name it after you.
After all, it was invented...

678
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,499
at your daughter's wedding.
So it'll be an honor...

679
00:51:49,625 --> 00:51:55,665
Farhan, Raju. I'll see you
in my office tomorrow

680
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:05,040
Sir, what was the cost per plate?
We'll reimburse you

681
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:07,040
... in installments

682
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,749
We'll never crash a wedding again
- Not even my own

683
00:52:12,875 --> 00:52:15,124
In fact, I won't even marry.
Nor will he

684
00:52:15,791 --> 00:52:17,832
Uh... right. No marriage

685
00:52:19,333 --> 00:52:21,707
Your parents shouldn't have
married either

686
00:52:23,375 --> 00:52:25,915
The world would have
to feed two less idiots

687
00:52:28,416 --> 00:52:29,457
Sit!

688
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:41,499
Pay attention

689
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:57,374
This is Ranchhoddas's father's
monthly income

690
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:05,040
Couple of zeroes less,
and it's still a sizeable income

691
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:13,915
But erase another zero,
and I would worry a little

692
00:53:15,166 --> 00:53:18,540
Isn't that your fathers income,
Farhan?

693
00:53:19,416 --> 00:53:21,124
Yes, sir

694
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,540
Now take away another zero...

695
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:31,374
and that's your family income,
Raju Rastogi

696
00:53:32,541 --> 00:53:33,915
Big reason to worry

697
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:45,790
Take my advice and shift into
Chatur Ramalingam's room

698
00:53:46,208 --> 00:53:50,457
Exams are here. Stay with
Rancho and you're sure to fail

699
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:14,790
Want a shave?
- No, sir

700
00:54:14,958 --> 00:54:15,832
Then get lost!

701
00:54:27,083 --> 00:54:32,665
Raju, don't worry. This is Virus's
move to split us. Divide and rule

702
00:54:32,791 --> 00:54:33,874
I have to worry

703
00:54:34,291 --> 00:54:37,790
He grades us, and I need
good grades for a good job

704
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:41,749
Unlike you, I don't have a
rich dad I can live off

705
00:54:41,875 --> 00:54:43,749
Shut up, Raju

706
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,665
Must we follow all his hogwash?
'Aal izz well'

707
00:54:47,041 --> 00:54:48,499
I won't be his flunky... like you

708
00:54:49,458 --> 00:54:51,749
You're crossing the line
- No, I'm drawing one

709
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:53,957
I have a family to support

710
00:54:56,166 --> 00:54:58,415
Dad's medicines
swallow up mom's pension

711
00:55:00,375 --> 00:55:04,749
My sis can't marry because
they want a car in dowry

712
00:55:07,666 --> 00:55:11,915
Mom hasn't bought a
single saree in five years

713
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:17,957
Now don't get your mom's
wardrobe into the debate

714
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:21,082
By the way, how many sarees
per annum is reasonable?

715
00:55:22,166 --> 00:55:23,415
Hey... no wisecracks about mom

716
00:55:24,166 --> 00:55:28,415
We'll study with all our heart,
but not just for grades

717
00:55:29,083 --> 00:55:33,415
To quote a Wise One - Study
to be accomplished, not affluent

718
00:55:34,166 --> 00:55:39,707
Follow excellence. And success
will chase you, pants down!

719
00:55:40,916 --> 00:55:43,540
Which Wise One says this?
His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas?

720
00:55:45,583 --> 00:55:46,582
Go rot in the bogs!

721
00:55:48,208 --> 00:55:51,207
Raju, don't stress. We'll top
our class. Nothing is impossible

722
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,665
Oh yeah?

723
00:55:56,333 --> 00:55:58,457
Shove this back into the tube

724
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,124
Raju got onto another train

725
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:08,832
His travails with Chatur began.
Yes, I mean travails, not travels

726
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:15,165
Chatur was called 'Silencer'

727
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:19,207
To sharpen his memory,
he popped pills from a local quack

728
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:21,582
And then let off silent...
but lethal farts

729
00:56:24,291 --> 00:56:27,499
I didn't do it... Raju?

730
00:56:27,666 --> 00:56:30,332
He always blamed others
for the output

731
00:56:31,083 --> 00:56:33,957
Silencer crammed 18 hours a day

732
00:56:34,208 --> 00:56:37,332
On exam eve,
he would distract others

733
00:56:41,291 --> 00:56:44,374
His belief - There are only
two ways of topping

734
00:56:44,708 --> 00:56:47,999
Elevate your own grades or
shrink your opponents' grades

735
00:56:52,291 --> 00:56:56,165
Rancho decided to subdue
Silencer and rescue Raju...

736
00:56:56,625 --> 00:56:57,915
with one master plan

737
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:07,957
Our Director has unceasingly
served... 'Served' means...

738
00:57:08,041 --> 00:57:12,082
Damn the meaning,
I'll memorize it

739
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:17,124
Chatur was the introductory speaker
at the Teachers' Day function

740
00:57:17,458 --> 00:57:21,374
To impress Virus, he got his
speech written by the librarian...

741
00:57:21,583 --> 00:57:22,915
in highbrow Hindi

742
00:57:24,458 --> 00:57:29,832
Hello. Hold on.
Chatur, call for you

743
00:57:30,208 --> 00:57:32,624
Please collect the printout.
I'll be right back

744
00:57:35,416 --> 00:57:37,290
Oh... the things I have to do...

745
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:44,040
Mr. Dubey, the Director was
remembering you

746
00:57:44,166 --> 00:57:45,749
Really?
- Yes. Just now

747
00:57:46,125 --> 00:57:49,499
I'll see him right away.
Give this to Chatur

748
00:57:54,666 --> 00:57:57,707
Hello. Hello
- Hello, Mr. Ramalingam?

749
00:57:57,833 --> 00:57:58,749
Yes?

750
00:57:59,333 --> 00:58:01,707
I'm calling from the police station

751
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:04,915
Are you from Uganda?
- Yes sir

752
00:58:06,458 --> 00:58:09,499
Your life is in danger
- What? ... How?

753
00:58:10,625 --> 00:58:12,415
Listen carefully, or else...

754
00:58:13,041 --> 00:58:17,374
you'll get killed as you step out
of the college gate

755
00:58:18,125 --> 00:58:19,374
Why? What happened?

756
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,082
While Chatur was kept engaged

757
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:25,499
Rancho altered a few words
in his speech, for eg...

758
00:58:25,708 --> 00:58:28,082
'served' became 'screwed'

759
00:58:28,916 --> 00:58:30,207
Yes sir?

760
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:33,290
Who are you?
- Dubey. Librarian

761
00:58:35,875 --> 00:58:37,040
I'm permanent staff, sir

762
00:58:37,666 --> 00:58:39,082
Congratulations

763
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,874
Hold on a moment.
The chief is on the other line

764
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:44,207
Excuse me, sir

765
00:58:53,875 --> 00:58:56,124
Yes... so where was I?

766
00:58:56,375 --> 00:58:58,790
You said I may die...
outside the gate

767
00:58:58,916 --> 00:59:05,332
Right. As you get out of the gate,
you'll see a traffic signal

768
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:07,582
Traffic signal. Ok

769
00:59:07,791 --> 00:59:13,332
When it turns red,
all the cars will halt

770
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:15,165
Ok. Then?

771
00:59:15,291 --> 00:59:17,290
Then cross the road
with great caution

772
00:59:18,041 --> 00:59:23,290
Because son, in rush hour
if a car hits you, you're dead

773
00:59:25,208 --> 00:59:27,040
What nonsense! I know that

774
00:59:27,166 --> 00:59:30,749
You know that? Excellent.
Then you're safe my boy

775
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:39,874
From the librarian, Silencer

776
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,582
You don't call me that,
Chanchad

777
00:59:47,416 --> 00:59:49,499
Hey. The Director said
he didn't call for me

778
00:59:50,291 --> 00:59:52,540
Who said 'called'?
I just said he 'remembered' you

779
00:59:52,708 --> 00:59:55,290
Remembered?
Rascals!

780
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:05,499
Distinguished Mr. Chairperson

781
01:00:07,791 --> 01:00:12,082
Chief guest, the Honorable
Minister of Education

782
01:00:12,708 --> 01:00:16,665
respected teachers and friends

783
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:23,124
ICE has now soared
beyond the stratosphere

784
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:28,040
The credit goes solely to

785
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:32,249
Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe.
Give him a big hand

786
01:00:32,375 --> 01:00:36,415
Sir, the voice is his
but the words are mine

787
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:39,415
He's a great guy, really you are

788
01:00:41,166 --> 01:00:49,082
For 32 years, he has
unceasingly screwed students

789
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:53,999
He means - 'served' students

790
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,832
I'm sure his endeavors
will continue

791
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:04,540
We are astounded at
how one man, in one lifetime

792
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:07,665
can screw so many, so well

793
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:16,040
With rigorous training
he's built up his stamina

794
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:26,374
He's spent every living minute
just screwing

795
01:01:28,958 --> 01:01:30,707
Let's replicate his methods

796
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:40,165
Tomorrow ICE students
will go across the globe

797
01:01:40,833 --> 01:01:47,040
Wherever we go,
we promise to screw

798
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:54,290
We'll hoist this screwer's flag
all over the world

799
01:01:59,875 --> 01:02:04,665
We'll show the world that
our capacity to screw...

800
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,999
cannot be matched by any student...

801
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:10,790
anywhere on the planet

802
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:21,540
Mr. Minister. Good evening

803
01:02:22,125 --> 01:02:29,624
You have given this institution
what it sorely needs

804
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:31,999
Booty, funds
- Bosom

805
01:02:35,583 --> 01:02:37,749
It's booty, stupid. Bosom means...

806
01:02:39,166 --> 01:02:41,207
What nonsense! That's insulting

807
01:02:41,666 --> 01:02:46,374
Everyone has a bosom,
but it remains pocketed

808
01:02:47,958 --> 01:02:49,957
No one offers it so readily

809
01:02:53,958 --> 01:02:54,915
Vulgar fellow!

810
01:02:55,083 --> 01:02:56,707
You have generously offered
your bosom...

811
01:02:57,083 --> 01:03:00,165
to this relentless screwer

812
01:03:03,125 --> 01:03:07,374
Now see how he makes it grow

813
01:03:07,625 --> 01:03:11,874
Is this what you teach here, Director?

814
01:03:19,541 --> 01:03:22,957
On this august occasion,
here's a Sanskrit verse...

815
01:03:23,083 --> 01:03:26,082
Listen to this - the might
of his fart in verse

816
01:03:26,625 --> 01:03:29,165
A good loud fart is honorable

817
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:31,749
'Fart'? Go, Silencer

818
01:03:31,916 --> 01:03:34,790
A medium fart is tolerable

819
01:03:38,083 --> 01:03:41,665
Softer windbreaks are terrible

820
01:03:44,625 --> 01:03:49,540
And the silent ones unbearable

821
01:03:59,666 --> 01:04:02,624
That's what mindless cramming
does to you

822
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:06,290
Cramming may see you
through four years of college

823
01:04:06,541 --> 01:04:10,374
but it will 'screw' you
for the next 40 years

824
01:04:11,583 --> 01:04:14,207
He still doesn't get it

825
01:04:20,333 --> 01:04:24,707
'Medium fart is tolerable'...
Unbelievable!

826
01:04:24,958 --> 01:04:27,624
You're a poet, Rancho.
How did you think of this?

827
01:04:29,041 --> 01:04:32,457
That was fun.
He didn't know what hit him

828
01:04:34,958 --> 01:04:38,290
You swines!
What did I ever do to you?

829
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:43,290
Sorry man.
Don't take it personally

830
01:04:43,541 --> 01:04:44,790
I will

831
01:04:45,375 --> 01:04:48,249
Chatur Ramalingam
will never forget this insult

832
01:04:48,875 --> 01:04:52,749
I'll think of it every minute,
every second of my life

833
01:04:53,041 --> 01:04:58,415
Sorry man. That was a demo
for Raju - Don't cram blindly

834
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:00,957
Understand and enjoy
the wonders of Science

835
01:05:01,083 --> 01:05:03,582
I'm not here to enjoy Science

836
01:05:03,708 --> 01:05:06,624
So You're here to screw Science

837
01:05:08,291 --> 01:05:11,290
Go ahead.
Laugh at my methods

838
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:16,707
But one day these methods
will bring me success

839
01:05:17,166 --> 01:05:20,040
That day I'll laugh and you'll cry

840
01:05:21,458 --> 01:05:25,707
You're on the wrong track again.
Don't chase success

841
01:05:26,583 --> 01:05:28,790
Become a good engineer
and success will chase you

842
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,624
These ideals don't work
in the real world

843
01:05:34,458 --> 01:05:38,457
You take your train, I'll take mine

844
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:42,540
Ten years from now
we'll meet at the same station

845
01:05:43,416 --> 01:05:48,374
Same day. Same place.
We'll see who's more successful

846
01:05:48,666 --> 01:05:51,082
you... or I

847
01:05:51,833 --> 01:05:56,165
Have the balls? C'mon, bet!

848
01:05:56,375 --> 01:05:59,957
It's a challenge

849
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:02,165
Watch it!

850
01:06:08,791 --> 01:06:09,707
What's he writing?

851
01:06:17,333 --> 01:06:19,624
Don't forget this date

852
01:06:27,916 --> 01:06:30,499
I'm not used to
such expensive gifts, Suhas

853
01:06:30,833 --> 01:06:32,082
Get used to them, Pia

854
01:06:32,208 --> 01:06:34,332
You're gonna be
Suhas Tandon's wife

855
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:35,582
Where's the bill, man?

856
01:06:40,041 --> 01:06:40,957
I'll be back

857
01:06:51,333 --> 01:06:52,999
You changed the speech?
- What?

858
01:06:53,083 --> 01:06:53,957
Don't lie

859
01:06:54,666 --> 01:06:56,540
Um... Yeah

860
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:59,165
What's your problem with dad?
- I have no problem

861
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:02,457
I'm making an inverter
named after him. Look... Oh

862
01:07:06,791 --> 01:07:08,290
Why're you harassing him?

863
01:07:09,166 --> 01:07:10,582
'Cause he runs a factory,
not a college

864
01:07:10,833 --> 01:07:14,540
Churning out asses.
Like that one

865
01:07:19,666 --> 01:07:20,707
She destroyed it, man

866
01:07:24,083 --> 01:07:25,332
How dare you call him an ass?

867
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:28,832
He is one!
First Engineering, then MBA

868
01:07:28,958 --> 01:07:30,749
then becomes a banker in the USA

869
01:07:31,666 --> 01:07:34,165
Because it rakes in
more money?

870
01:07:34,416 --> 01:07:36,957
Life for him is just
a profit-loss statement

871
01:07:37,208 --> 01:07:39,207
He sees profit in you,
so he's with you

872
01:07:39,541 --> 01:07:43,207
Director's daughter, doctor in the
making... Good for his image!

873
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:44,790
It's not you he cares for

874
01:07:47,041 --> 01:07:48,415
Who do you think you are?

875
01:07:48,666 --> 01:07:50,332
What do you mean
he doesn't care for me?

876
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:54,249
New watch? One moment

877
01:07:55,458 --> 01:07:57,540
You always need a demo

878
01:07:58,583 --> 01:07:59,415
Hey Suhas

879
01:08:01,583 --> 01:08:03,165
Where were you?

880
01:08:03,583 --> 01:08:05,249
She's looking for her watch

881
01:08:05,416 --> 01:08:07,207
What? You lost the watch

882
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:08,624
Never mind. Get another

883
01:08:08,916 --> 01:08:10,207
It cost 400,000!

884
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:14,207
Mine's just 250/-
but keeps the same time

885
01:08:14,375 --> 01:08:16,707
Keep quiet... How could
you be so careless, Pia

886
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:19,999
This callous attitude is
disgusting. It's disrespectful

887
01:08:20,125 --> 01:08:22,707
That was a limited edition watch

888
01:08:23,083 --> 01:08:26,540
Now wear your ancient
piece of junk at dinner

889
01:08:27,875 --> 01:08:29,290
What're you staring at?

890
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:34,999
Here come the tears!
Real mature, Pia

891
01:08:35,541 --> 01:08:36,790
I can't handle this

892
01:08:37,625 --> 01:08:39,749
Stop crying and look for it

893
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:56,165
Find another wrist
for this watch... Ass!

894
01:09:02,583 --> 01:09:05,249
Hey, you're awesome.
Called him an ass to his face

895
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:06,374
Get lost

896
01:09:07,166 --> 01:09:08,332
It's too noisy here

897
01:09:08,666 --> 01:09:10,582
She's saying 'Thank you',
I hear 'Get lost'

898
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:13,582
I said 'Get lost'
- Don't get so uptight

899
01:09:13,958 --> 01:09:16,707
Actually, you never
really loved him

900
01:09:17,125 --> 01:09:17,999
What do you mean?

901
01:09:18,375 --> 01:09:23,165
When you see him, do the
winds whisper a melody?

902
01:09:24,708 --> 01:09:26,332
Your scarf flies in slow motion?

903
01:09:27,333 --> 01:09:29,082
The Moon appears gigantic?

904
01:09:29,583 --> 01:09:32,165
That happens in movies, not in life

905
01:09:32,291 --> 01:09:35,332
Happens in life too -
if you love a person

906
01:09:35,666 --> 01:09:36,749
... not an ass

907
01:09:42,125 --> 01:09:46,790
Hello. What?

908
01:09:47,875 --> 01:09:51,374
Oh God! Ok, I'm on my way

909
01:09:54,583 --> 01:09:56,499
You're a medical student,
right? Need your help

910
01:09:56,583 --> 01:09:58,290
It's an emergency, please
- What?

911
01:09:58,791 --> 01:10:01,999
Please come with me.
What's that oath you doctors take -

912
01:10:02,208 --> 01:10:04,874
You'll never deny a patient help...
The Hippocratic Oath

913
01:10:05,541 --> 01:10:07,374
Please help me,
it's an emergency

914
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:15,040
You gatecrash my sister's wedding,
break off my engagement...

915
01:10:15,416 --> 01:10:17,790
my dad is popping
BP pills because of you...

916
01:10:18,291 --> 01:10:19,874
and here I am, helping you!

917
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,207
Unbelievable!

918
01:10:23,375 --> 01:10:27,249
This Hippocratic Oath -
It's really done us in!

919
01:10:32,083 --> 01:10:33,999
Where's Raju, ma'am?
- Gone to get a cab

920
01:10:34,375 --> 01:10:35,874
Called the ambulance
two hours ago

921
01:10:36,166 --> 01:10:38,749
In this country,
pizza reaches in 30 minutes

922
01:10:38,958 --> 01:10:39,874
but an ambulance... !

923
01:10:40,125 --> 01:10:42,415
He needs hospitalization.
Urgently

924
01:10:56,541 --> 01:10:57,582
Hey stop!

925
01:10:59,875 --> 01:11:02,124
Move, it's an emergency!

926
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:07,915
Move... move...

927
01:11:11,958 --> 01:11:14,124
Doctor, emergency!

928
01:11:15,708 --> 01:11:16,624
That's the patient

929
01:11:22,583 --> 01:11:24,665
Keep this. Hey, here's Raju

930
01:11:25,166 --> 01:11:27,082
What the hell!
You brought dad on the scooter

931
01:11:28,958 --> 01:11:30,290
Should I've sent him by courier?

932
01:11:30,666 --> 01:11:33,499
No wisecracks on dads profession!
Where is he?

933
01:11:34,083 --> 01:11:35,915
Go ask the doctor

934
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:40,124
Close call, Pia. A little delay,
we'd have lost him

935
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,040
Glad you didn't wait for an ambulance
and got him on the scooter

936
01:11:42,166 --> 01:11:44,957
Call me if there's a problem

937
01:11:54,083 --> 01:11:57,082
Rancho! Thank you...

938
01:11:58,833 --> 01:12:01,874
Thanking your buddies!
Silencer teaching you manners?

939
01:12:03,083 --> 01:12:06,165
Didn't he teach you -
A friend is man's greatest bosom?

940
01:12:07,958 --> 01:12:10,874
Go on now.
You have an exam tomorrow

941
01:12:11,458 --> 01:12:14,707
Exams we have many...
Dad mostly just one

942
01:12:16,375 --> 01:12:18,665
We won't budge from here
without the Postmaster

943
01:12:19,291 --> 01:12:20,249
Don't worry

944
01:12:27,291 --> 01:12:31,457
Rancho, forgive me.
I was scared

945
01:12:31,708 --> 01:12:33,832
It's ok. Quiet, now

946
01:12:36,375 --> 01:12:38,540
Please forgive me

947
01:12:45,125 --> 01:12:49,165
It's ok, calm down.
Go see your dad

948
01:12:49,708 --> 01:12:51,082
And don't go
with that weepy face

949
01:12:57,375 --> 01:12:58,374
Thanks buddy

950
01:13:09,958 --> 01:13:14,749
Natty scooter. Saved a life.
How much does it cost?

951
01:13:15,041 --> 01:13:17,374
Pour some mint sauce
on it. It'll tell you

952
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,915
Hey, happy Independence Day

953
01:13:22,166 --> 01:13:23,874
Today isn't Independence Day

954
01:13:24,208 --> 01:13:27,374
For you it is! Now you're free
to wear your mom's watch

955
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,749
No ass can say it's an
ancient piece of junk

956
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:33,915
Hey

957
01:13:35,875 --> 01:13:37,874
How do you know
it was mom's watch?

958
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:42,082
At your sister's wedding,
you wore sparkling new clothes

959
01:13:42,875 --> 01:13:44,082
Only the watch was old

960
01:13:44,708 --> 01:13:45,624
What could that mean?

961
01:13:47,916 --> 01:13:51,082
You really missed your mom
that day, didn't you?

962
01:13:53,916 --> 01:13:54,957
Yes

963
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,749
Your mom must've been
really beautiful

964
01:14:00,291 --> 01:14:02,457
Yes. How do you know?

965
01:14:02,708 --> 01:14:03,707
Seen your dad?

966
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:06,915
'Life is a race. If you don't run fast

967
01:14:07,083 --> 01:14:08,707
you'll be a broken egg
... cuckoo bird'

968
01:14:09,125 --> 01:14:10,082
You...

969
01:14:12,375 --> 01:14:19,999
The winds whisper a melody

970
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:26,957
The sky hums along

971
01:14:28,541 --> 01:14:34,457
Time itself is singing...

972
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:39,040
Zoobi do...

973
01:14:39,791 --> 01:14:44,374
Param pum

974
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,707
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

975
01:14:51,416 --> 01:14:55,999
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

976
01:14:56,666 --> 01:15:01,707
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

977
01:15:02,041 --> 01:15:06,707
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

978
01:15:07,041 --> 01:15:12,124
Leaves sing on their branches
Bees jam with flowers

979
01:15:12,416 --> 01:15:17,249
Crazy sunbeams dance off petals
As birds yodel in the skies

980
01:15:17,833 --> 01:15:22,749
Flowers, bold and brazen
Snuggle and cootchie-coo

981
01:15:23,208 --> 01:15:27,790
I've seen it happen in movies
What's now happening with us

982
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:33,415
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

983
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,624
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

984
01:15:39,541 --> 01:15:44,290
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

985
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:49,749
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

986
01:15:52,916 --> 01:15:55,957
Let's make the unique and
ever useful mint sauce

987
01:15:56,375 --> 01:16:01,749
The all-powerful sauce that
exposes phony people

988
01:16:02,666 --> 01:16:04,999
Your 7th house is clear

989
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:07,665
Shunning an ass,
you'll fall for a human

990
01:16:08,166 --> 01:16:09,874
Time is ripe for love

991
01:16:14,666 --> 01:16:16,624
Temperature in New Delhi
remains stable

992
01:16:16,750 --> 01:16:21,082
Clear skies.
But if in love, expect rain

993
01:16:26,708 --> 01:16:31,332
Pitter-patter go the raindrops
Whish-whoosh whistles the wind

994
01:16:31,833 --> 01:16:36,874
Do-da-dee waltzes the rain
Boom-boom echoes the sky

995
01:16:37,166 --> 01:16:42,249
Drenched in rain and passion
You sway your hips on cue

996
01:16:42,458 --> 01:16:47,249
I've seen it happen in movies
What's now happening with us

997
01:16:48,125 --> 01:16:52,707
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

998
01:16:53,541 --> 01:16:57,957
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

999
01:16:58,708 --> 01:17:03,457
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

1000
01:17:04,166 --> 01:17:08,999
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

1001
01:17:30,583 --> 01:17:35,249
The gorgeous low moon
Serenades the earth

1002
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:40,832
A shooting star skips along
Crooning a ballad of love

1003
01:17:41,333 --> 01:17:46,207
The night is bright but lonesome
Come touch me, my handsome

1004
01:17:46,583 --> 01:17:51,415
I've seen it happen in movies
What's now happening with us

1005
01:17:52,291 --> 01:17:56,832
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

1006
01:17:57,375 --> 01:18:02,207
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

1007
01:18:02,875 --> 01:18:07,332
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

1008
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,957
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

1009
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:26,749
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi'
...goes my silly heart

1010
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:34,624
Hello. Wake up

1011
01:18:35,541 --> 01:18:38,165
Huh... Postmaster's dead?
- What!

1012
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:39,749
No, stupid

1013
01:18:40,166 --> 01:18:42,499
It's 8.30, your exam is at 9

1014
01:18:43,166 --> 01:18:45,540
But we can't leave him alone

1015
01:18:45,875 --> 01:18:48,665
I'm here.
It's a matter of three hours

1016
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:51,415
Take my scooter.
It's getting late

1017
01:18:51,875 --> 01:18:52,915
Hey...

1018
01:18:57,291 --> 01:18:58,665
Gosh, what an ancient watch

1019
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:06,165
Go

1020
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:26,665
Sorry, we're late
- It was an emergency

1021
01:19:32,541 --> 01:19:33,665
Settle down there

1022
01:19:38,208 --> 01:19:39,457
Sir, they're still writing

1023
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:42,499
Hello. Time up

1024
01:19:43,333 --> 01:19:45,957
Please, five minutes.
We started half an hour late

1025
01:19:46,125 --> 01:19:47,332
It was an emergency

1026
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:51,707
He glared at us like we'd
asked for both his kidneys

1027
01:19:52,916 --> 01:19:54,082
But we continued writing

1028
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:58,082
He continued arranging
the answer sheets

1029
01:20:06,583 --> 01:20:07,499
Done, sir

1030
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:11,124
You're late.
I can't accept these

1031
01:20:11,333 --> 01:20:12,207
Sir, please, sir

1032
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:18,082
Sir, do you know who we are?

1033
01:20:19,541 --> 01:20:21,374
Prime Ministers son?
Even then...

1034
01:20:21,666 --> 01:20:23,749
I will not accept your paper

1035
01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:27,249
Do you know
our names and roll numbers?

1036
01:20:28,541 --> 01:20:29,665
No...

1037
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:32,540
Who are you?

1038
01:20:32,625 --> 01:20:34,624
He doesn't know - Run!

1039
01:20:36,291 --> 01:20:38,582
Hey, what's your roll number?

1040
01:20:39,375 --> 01:20:43,665
Where the hell are their papers?

1041
01:20:48,166 --> 01:20:49,999
O Lord, have mercy

1042
01:20:50,083 --> 01:20:55,874
Today was Results day.
Time to make a deal with God

1043
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,499
Just save my Electronics.
I'll offer a coconut

1044
01:20:58,958 --> 01:21:03,874
Sir Snake, bless my Physics.
I promise a pint of milk per day

1045
01:21:04,083 --> 01:21:07,499
O Mother Cow,
help me pass... have this grass

1046
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:11,082
I vow: No X-rated thoughts
of girls in my class...

1047
01:21:11,375 --> 01:21:12,832
Watch over my results

1048
01:21:13,041 --> 01:21:16,915
God of Wealth, I'll offer 100/-
every month

1049
01:21:17,125 --> 01:21:19,749
100/- won't bribe even a traffic cop

1050
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:22,290
let alone the Almighty

1051
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,582
Check from the bottom

1052
01:21:26,583 --> 01:21:28,707
You are... last

1053
01:21:30,416 --> 01:21:31,332
And you?

1054
01:21:33,375 --> 01:21:34,832
Second last

1055
01:21:36,416 --> 01:21:37,499
Rancho?

1056
01:21:41,916 --> 01:21:42,999
Not there

1057
01:21:44,375 --> 01:21:45,415
My heart sank

1058
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:50,415
Not 'cause our ranks tanked,
but 'cause our friend flunked

1059
01:21:52,875 --> 01:21:56,582
There's a mistake.
It's not possible. It's injustice

1060
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:03,624
What's Silencer howling about?

1061
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:05,207
He got the second rank

1062
01:22:07,541 --> 01:22:08,582
Who's first?

1063
01:22:09,791 --> 01:22:10,915
Rancho

1064
01:22:13,791 --> 01:22:14,665
Rancho?

1065
01:22:17,125 --> 01:22:17,957
Move aside

1066
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:25,040
We learned a lesson
in Human Behavior:

1067
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:31,207
Your friend fails, you feel bad.
Your friend tops, you feel worse

1068
01:22:31,916 --> 01:22:36,332
We were sad.
Two others were sadder

1069
01:22:37,583 --> 01:22:41,457
Ranchhoddas Chanchad.
Front row. Right of the Director

1070
01:22:42,083 --> 01:22:44,374
Uday Sinha. Second row. Third seat

1071
01:22:45,291 --> 01:22:48,540
Alok Mittal. Second row. Fifth seat

1072
01:22:50,333 --> 01:22:52,999
Sahili Rao. Third row...

1073
01:22:53,166 --> 01:22:55,624
Sir, why this seating
according to rank?

1074
01:22:56,791 --> 01:22:58,040
Any problem with that?

1075
01:22:58,166 --> 01:23:02,290
Yes, this grading system is
like a caste system

1076
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:05,915
A-graders: Masters
C-graders: Slaves

1077
01:23:06,208 --> 01:23:09,499
It's not nice, sir
- You have a better idea?

1078
01:23:10,083 --> 01:23:14,249
Yes. Results should not be
displayed at all

1079
01:23:14,708 --> 01:23:18,790
Why publicise someone's flaws?

1080
01:23:19,083 --> 01:23:24,124
If your iron count is low,
will the doctor prescribe tonic...

1081
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:25,707
or air your report on TV

1082
01:23:26,541 --> 01:23:27,624
You see, sir?

1083
01:23:28,208 --> 01:23:29,999
So basically,
what you are saying is

1084
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,290
I should personally go to
each student's room

1085
01:23:33,333 --> 01:23:34,415
and whisper in his ears...

1086
01:23:35,458 --> 01:23:37,874
'You have come first';
'You're second';

1087
01:23:37,958 --> 01:23:39,540
'Oh, I'm so sorry,
you have failed'

1088
01:23:42,541 --> 01:23:46,915
No sir, I mean
grades create a divide

1089
01:23:49,250 --> 01:23:51,207
I've topped, so I'm next to you

1090
01:23:51,458 --> 01:23:53,874
My pals came last,
they're in the back corner

1091
01:23:54,041 --> 01:23:55,582
At least they're in the corner

1092
01:23:55,708 --> 01:23:58,124
More time with you, and
they'll be out of the photo

1093
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:01,249
They will neither pass,
nor get a job

1094
01:24:02,041 --> 01:24:05,915
They'll get jobs, sir.
There must be some firm that...

1095
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:08,207
prefers humans to machines

1096
01:24:10,083 --> 01:24:11,915
They'll get jobs. I guarantee

1097
01:24:13,916 --> 01:24:16,249
You guarantee it!

1098
01:24:16,458 --> 01:24:17,999
Bet, sir?

1099
01:24:21,375 --> 01:24:22,707
Govind
- Yes, sir?

1100
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:30,165
Even if one of them gets
a job in campus interviews...

1101
01:24:31,375 --> 01:24:32,582
shave off my moustache

1102
01:24:34,416 --> 01:24:36,207
Sir!

1103
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:39,540
Happy?
- Smile, please

1104
01:24:40,833 --> 01:24:41,790
Happy, sir

1105
01:24:46,166 --> 01:24:49,749
Jackass!
Honking to hide your tooting

1106
01:24:50,291 --> 01:24:52,999
Septic tank! Popping pills again?

1107
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:55,915
I didn't do it... Raju?

1108
01:24:56,125 --> 01:24:57,749
This is a familiar stink

1109
01:24:57,833 --> 01:25:00,874
He's the sole cause for
global warming

1110
01:25:26,125 --> 01:25:28,749
Toss me your wallet - I'll buy pants

1111
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:33,499
Take Chatur's suit instead
- Don't touch my suit

1112
01:25:34,666 --> 01:25:36,457
Rancho'll recognize you
even in underwear

1113
01:25:36,625 --> 01:25:40,624
Where's this?
- If I could read, would I sell peanuts?

1114
01:25:40,833 --> 01:25:43,415
He can't read
- But he can speak

1115
01:25:43,625 --> 01:25:47,624
Wait. Do you know a
Ranchhoddas Chanchad?

1116
01:25:47,833 --> 01:25:49,582
Yes, he lives there

1117
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:55,582
Free as the wind was he

1118
01:25:57,583 --> 01:26:02,999
Like a soaring kite was he

1119
01:26:04,666 --> 01:26:06,957
Where did he go...

1120
01:26:07,166 --> 01:26:09,415
let's find him

1121
01:26:09,541 --> 01:26:12,207
Chatur, your pills
- Thanks. Where were they?

1122
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:14,790
In the pocket
- Hey, my pants!

1123
01:26:14,916 --> 01:26:16,915
Karl Marx says to
share all resources

1124
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:20,457
Hey, you'll give people ideas

1125
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,040
I want it now

1126
01:26:38,291 --> 01:26:39,415
What happened?

1127
01:26:41,541 --> 01:26:42,749
Rancho's father

1128
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:48,999
Excuse me,
where is Ranchhoddas?

1129
01:26:49,833 --> 01:26:52,249
There he is
- Thank you

1130
01:27:15,416 --> 01:27:18,582
Rancho...
- Yes?

1131
01:27:19,166 --> 01:27:22,874
Sorry. We're looking for Ranchhoddas

1132
01:27:23,875 --> 01:27:25,207
I am Ranchhoddas

1133
01:27:25,791 --> 01:27:29,707
No, I mean... 'Ranchhoddas
Shamaldas Chanchad'

1134
01:27:31,125 --> 01:27:33,707
Ranchhoddas Shamaldas
Chanchad. That's me

1135
01:27:39,166 --> 01:27:41,457
Ranchhoddas, take care, son

1136
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:02,874
'Ranchhoddas Chanchad'

1137
01:28:10,041 --> 01:28:11,082
Raju

1138
01:28:36,333 --> 01:28:39,957
I'll be in the Guinness Book for
driving Delhi-Shimla in underwear

1139
01:28:40,083 --> 01:28:41,207
That too, for the wrong guy!

1140
01:28:41,708 --> 01:28:45,665
Same name, same degree,
same photo, but a different guy

1141
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:47,707
What's going on?

1142
01:28:48,416 --> 01:28:51,082
How did Silencer get
Rancho's address?

1143
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:53,124
Good point!

1144
01:28:54,541 --> 01:28:55,957
Hey Chatur, come here

1145
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:05,749
How dare you open this?
I got this from San Francisco

1146
01:29:05,791 --> 01:29:07,332
Handmade biscuits

1147
01:29:09,166 --> 01:29:11,415
Specially for Mr. Phunsukh Wangdu

1148
01:29:11,666 --> 01:29:13,832
Phunsukh Bangdu?
Who's that?

1149
01:29:13,916 --> 01:29:18,540
Not Bangdu. Wangdu. 'W'.
Phunsukh Wangdu

1150
01:29:18,625 --> 01:29:21,457
Do you know who that is?
He's a great scientist

1151
01:29:21,541 --> 01:29:24,249
400 patents.
The world wants him

1152
01:29:25,291 --> 01:29:28,749
Took me a year
to get an appointment

1153
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:34,957
Once he signs the deal with
my company, I'll be huge!

1154
01:29:35,041 --> 01:29:39,207
Forget Wangdu.
How'd you get Rancho's address?

1155
01:29:39,333 --> 01:29:41,290
You should be thanking
Phunsukh Wangdu

1156
01:29:41,666 --> 01:29:45,249
He led me to Rancho, See this

1157
01:29:47,416 --> 01:29:51,874
My secretary was here to fix
an appointment with Wangdu

1158
01:29:51,958 --> 01:29:56,290
She didn't get the appointment.
But I found Rancho

1159
01:29:56,416 --> 01:30:02,040
I checked the Shimla directory
and found Rancho's name

1160
01:30:02,083 --> 01:30:03,749
What happened to his face?

1161
01:30:04,125 --> 01:30:06,457
Plastic surgery
in honor of your visit?

1162
01:30:10,833 --> 01:30:12,665
Only one man has the answer

1163
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:17,915
Sorry Papa,
I couldn't fulfill your last wish

1164
01:30:19,375 --> 01:30:23,165
You kept asking me
to take you on pilgrimage

1165
01:30:24,083 --> 01:30:26,582
But I waited
for the highway tender

1166
01:30:28,083 --> 01:30:32,540
There the tender opened,
here you closed your eyes

1167
01:30:36,625 --> 01:30:41,124
I am so sorry, Papa.
I could not be a good son...

1168
01:30:41,291 --> 01:30:42,624
Wrong

1169
01:30:43,083 --> 01:30:45,915
You're an engineer.
Your degree's on the wall!

1170
01:30:46,208 --> 01:30:47,499
You were a very good son

1171
01:30:50,125 --> 01:30:54,874
How dare you barge in?
I'll have you arrested

1172
01:30:55,041 --> 01:30:58,249
No, you'll be arrested.
We've made enquiries

1173
01:30:58,541 --> 01:31:01,624
You use the degree
to clinch contracts

1174
01:31:02,083 --> 01:31:05,332
It's our friend's degree.
How did you get it?

1175
01:31:20,916 --> 01:31:22,332
This is a 150 acre estate

1176
01:31:22,750 --> 01:31:25,957
If I shoot and bury you,
no one would even notice

1177
01:31:26,291 --> 01:31:27,207
Get the point?

1178
01:31:28,541 --> 01:31:29,415
Now get lost

1179
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:39,290
I'm taking Papa's ashes to the
sacred river. Can take yours too

1180
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:48,332
Grab Papa!

1181
01:31:51,250 --> 01:31:52,374
Here, here

1182
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:57,540
Let go of Papa!

1183
01:32:00,458 --> 01:32:03,290
Tell the truth or
Papa is flushed!

1184
01:32:03,416 --> 01:32:06,332
Hand over Papa
- Papa goes to the sacred sewer

1185
01:32:07,041 --> 01:32:10,374
Get Papa out of the potty
- You pull trigger, I pull flush.

1186
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:11,832
I'll count to three

1187
01:32:11,875 --> 01:32:15,624
Wanna shoot us?
Raju, scatter the ashes

1188
01:32:18,291 --> 01:32:19,290
One

1189
01:32:19,458 --> 01:32:24,207
Take us down,
and Papa's down the drain

1190
01:32:25,458 --> 01:32:26,374
Two

1191
01:32:26,458 --> 01:32:28,915
Then grope for him in the gutter

1192
01:32:29,041 --> 01:32:29,915
What is it, Raju?

1193
01:32:31,333 --> 01:32:33,832
We've got the wrong urn.
It's empty!

1194
01:32:34,708 --> 01:32:35,624
Empty?

1195
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:40,457
Empty - we'll empty it out!

1196
01:32:40,583 --> 01:32:41,457
No, no!

1197
01:32:41,541 --> 01:32:44,415
We'll empty it out

1198
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:46,957
No... hands up!

1199
01:32:49,250 --> 01:32:52,290
Who are you?

1200
01:32:52,458 --> 01:32:53,582
I am Rancho

1201
01:32:54,875 --> 01:32:57,332
I swear on Papa, it's true

1202
01:32:57,541 --> 01:32:59,332
I am Rancho!
That was Chhote.

1203
01:33:00,458 --> 01:33:01,290
Chhote?

1204
01:33:02,666 --> 01:33:07,665
He was our gardener's son, Chhote

1205
01:33:09,625 --> 01:33:12,457
He stayed on with us
after he was orphaned

1206
01:33:14,666 --> 01:33:22,499
Did odd jobs around the house,
ran errands

1207
01:33:23,916 --> 01:33:25,207
He had a passion for learning

1208
01:33:28,458 --> 01:33:31,124
He'd wear my old uniform
and slip into school

1209
01:33:33,125 --> 01:33:36,082
And attend any class he liked.
It suited me

1210
01:33:37,041 --> 01:33:43,124
I made him do my homework,
take my exams

1211
01:33:43,625 --> 01:33:46,665
It was going well, till
one day...

1212
01:33:47,083 --> 01:33:51,665
Our teacher saw a sixth grader
doing tenth grade math

1213
01:33:51,708 --> 01:33:53,249
Which grade are you in, son?

1214
01:33:54,458 --> 01:33:55,665
What's your name?

1215
01:33:56,625 --> 01:33:57,582
We got caught

1216
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:00,124
Papa was a powerful man, so...

1217
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:03,749
our teacher alerted him
before going to the Principal

1218
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:08,207
You started it, you will finish it

1219
01:34:10,916 --> 01:34:13,707
People pretend to show me respect

1220
01:34:14,416 --> 01:34:16,624
But behind my back...

1221
01:34:17,583 --> 01:34:19,207
mock me as an illiterate

1222
01:34:20,208 --> 01:34:22,249
I won't let that happen to my son

1223
01:34:23,333 --> 01:34:27,665
This boy wants to study.
I want just a degree

1224
01:34:28,208 --> 01:34:30,165
Let the game go on

1225
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:32,790
Make this kid an engineer

1226
01:34:34,041 --> 01:34:39,415
and I'll have a degree
in my son's name on that wall

1227
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:43,749
I went to London for four years,
he went to college as me

1228
01:34:45,416 --> 01:34:51,582
He'd promised to cut contact with all
after getting the degree

1229
01:34:53,708 --> 01:35:01,957
But he always said,
'Two idiots will come looking for me'

1230
01:35:06,916 --> 01:35:08,582
He really misses you both

1231
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,957
I'll give you his address,
go to him

1232
01:35:18,291 --> 01:35:21,790
But please keep my secret

1233
01:35:23,666 --> 01:35:24,832
What secret?

1234
01:35:38,166 --> 01:35:41,665
You got the wrong urn, sir.
Papa is in here

1235
01:35:43,875 --> 01:35:46,457
What the hell's going on?
Who was that gun guy?

1236
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:50,040
Complicated story.
Without subtitles. Not for you

1237
01:35:50,083 --> 01:35:52,374
Ignore it
- Where're we going?

1238
01:35:53,708 --> 01:35:54,624
Ladakh

1239
01:35:54,666 --> 01:35:56,040
Ladakh! Why?

1240
01:35:56,750 --> 01:35:57,707
To meet Rancho

1241
01:35:57,875 --> 01:36:00,874
What's he doing in Ladakh?

1242
01:36:00,916 --> 01:36:04,499
No clue. We have
the address of a school

1243
01:36:04,750 --> 01:36:07,832
School teacher!

1244
01:36:08,708 --> 01:36:12,124
I'm Vice President of
Rockledge Corporation, and he...

1245
01:36:12,541 --> 01:36:14,832
A for Apple, B for Ball...

1246
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,207
D for Donkey

1247
01:36:16,916 --> 01:36:21,874
Next week I sign a huge deal
with Phunsukh Wangdu

1248
01:36:22,041 --> 01:36:25,082
And he... A for Apple, B for Ball...

1249
01:36:28,791 --> 01:36:31,207
Today my respect
for that idiot shot up

1250
01:36:32,125 --> 01:36:34,457
Most of us went to college
just for a degree

1251
01:36:35,041 --> 01:36:39,249
No degree meant
no plum job, no pretty wife...

1252
01:36:39,541 --> 01:36:42,124
no credit card, no social status

1253
01:36:42,791 --> 01:36:44,624
None of this mattered to him

1254
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:46,582
He was in college
for the joy of learning

1255
01:36:47,083 --> 01:36:50,374
He never cared
if he was first or last

1256
01:36:50,958 --> 01:36:53,290
Who was the first man
on the Moon?

1257
01:36:53,541 --> 01:36:54,790
Neil Armstrong, sir

1258
01:36:54,833 --> 01:36:56,999
Obviously, it is Neil Armstrong.
We all know it

1259
01:36:57,166 --> 01:36:58,415
Who was the second?

1260
01:36:58,916 --> 01:37:00,540
Don't waste your time.
It's not important

1261
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,499
Nobody remembers the man
who ever came second

1262
01:37:04,625 --> 01:37:10,082
Soon, 26 companies
will be here with job offers

1263
01:37:10,541 --> 01:37:16,207
You'll have a job
even before your final exam

1264
01:37:16,958 --> 01:37:18,832
This is your last lap, my friends

1265
01:37:19,166 --> 01:37:21,374
Put the pedal to the metal.
Step on the gas

1266
01:37:21,458 --> 01:37:23,457
Go out there and make history!

1267
01:37:26,875 --> 01:37:28,124
Any questions?

1268
01:37:30,625 --> 01:37:31,540
Yes?

1269
01:37:32,875 --> 01:37:36,499
Sir, suppose a student gets a job...

1270
01:37:36,875 --> 01:37:44,165
but narrowly fails the final exam,
will he still have the job?

1271
01:37:44,666 --> 01:37:45,999
Very good question

1272
01:37:49,250 --> 01:37:51,624
Anyone else
with the same question?

1273
01:37:53,541 --> 01:37:54,874
As expected

1274
01:37:57,208 --> 01:38:00,332
Please come on stage.
Give them a big hand

1275
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:13,790
For the last four years

1276
01:38:13,833 --> 01:38:16,790
they've been our most
consistent students

1277
01:38:16,916 --> 01:38:20,249
Consistently last in every exam

1278
01:38:21,083 --> 01:38:22,457
Come my geniuses, come

1279
01:38:23,916 --> 01:38:29,540
Their brains will fetch
a handsome price

1280
01:38:30,250 --> 01:38:33,290
'Cause they're completely unused

1281
01:38:35,791 --> 01:38:37,040
And to answer their question -

1282
01:38:37,416 --> 01:38:40,749
The exam won't affect their jobs

1283
01:38:41,541 --> 01:38:45,082
Because no company
will hire them anyway!

1284
01:38:45,916 --> 01:38:48,957
They're so unique, their
names will be writ in gold -

1285
01:38:49,250 --> 01:38:52,165
'Farhanitrate' and 'Prerajulization'

1286
01:38:52,250 --> 01:38:53,749
Give them a big hand,
please, everybody

1287
01:39:02,833 --> 01:39:07,707
He screwed us!

1288
01:39:07,833 --> 01:39:09,790
In front of everyone

1289
01:39:10,916 --> 01:39:16,040
God, I'll give up meat,
light a 1000 incense sticks

1290
01:39:16,125 --> 01:39:17,915
Do me just one favor -

1291
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,457
Delete Virus!

1292
01:39:22,083 --> 01:39:24,082
Burn him in hell

1293
01:39:25,458 --> 01:39:29,290
Fry Virus-nuggets in bubbling oil

1294
01:39:30,041 --> 01:39:32,915
You think God is a contract killer?

1295
01:39:33,541 --> 01:39:34,832
You shut up

1296
01:39:35,541 --> 01:39:38,457
You're in the center
of the photo every year

1297
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:40,457
We're rotting in the corner

1298
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:44,540
This year we may fall
out of the photo altogether

1299
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,832
Know why I come first?
- Why?

1300
01:39:49,250 --> 01:39:50,957
Because I love machines

1301
01:39:51,750 --> 01:39:53,582
Engineering is my passion

1302
01:39:54,625 --> 01:39:55,874
Know your passion?

1303
01:39:58,708 --> 01:40:00,415
That's my bag
- Be quiet

1304
01:40:01,375 --> 01:40:02,707
What're you up to?

1305
01:40:05,125 --> 01:40:07,290
This... is your passion

1306
01:40:08,541 --> 01:40:09,957
Go post this letter

1307
01:40:10,333 --> 01:40:11,665
What letter?

1308
01:40:14,375 --> 01:40:18,665
5 years ago he wrote this for
his favorite wildlife photographer

1309
01:40:19,416 --> 01:40:22,207
Andre...
- Istvan

1310
01:40:23,166 --> 01:40:26,790
He wanted to train with him
in Hungary

1311
01:40:27,708 --> 01:40:31,040
But in fear of his dad, the Fuhrer,
never posted it

1312
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:36,332
Quit Engineering, marry Photography

1313
01:40:37,291 --> 01:40:39,290
Follow your talent

1314
01:40:42,416 --> 01:40:46,457
If Michael Jackson's dad
forced him to be a boxer...

1315
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:50,790
and Mohammad Ali's dad
pushed him to be a singer...

1316
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:52,832
imagine the disaster

1317
01:40:54,875 --> 01:40:57,415
Do you get it?

1318
01:41:00,958 --> 01:41:04,290
Idiot! Loves Photography,
but is marrying machines

1319
01:41:08,916 --> 01:41:10,332
Your Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas

1320
01:41:11,625 --> 01:41:15,790
Engineering is
my wife and mistress both

1321
01:41:17,208 --> 01:41:19,749
But I still fail. Why?
- Explain

1322
01:41:20,875 --> 01:41:23,249
'Cause you're a coward,
scared of the future

1323
01:41:24,958 --> 01:41:29,457
Look at this -
more holy rings than fingers

1324
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,207
One ring per fear -
exam, sis's dowry, job

1325
01:41:34,666 --> 01:41:38,457
With such fear of tomorrow,
how'll you live today?

1326
01:41:39,291 --> 01:41:40,957
How'll you focus on studies?

1327
01:41:42,291 --> 01:41:45,415
Strange buddies! One lives
in fear, the other in pretense

1328
01:41:46,375 --> 01:41:51,749
You live in both - fear and pretense

1329
01:41:51,958 --> 01:41:58,040
You're scared to tell Pia you
love her... so you pretend you don't

1330
01:42:00,541 --> 01:42:02,624
What rubbish!

1331
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:07,332
Easy to offer free advice,
tough to follow it

1332
01:42:07,416 --> 01:42:10,665
Have the guts? Go confess to Pia.

1333
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:14,999
There's no connection!
- Deep connection, Your Holiness

1334
01:42:15,083 --> 01:42:20,582
Listen, if you confess to Pia

1335
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:25,457
I'll tell Dad - No Engineering,
I'm marrying Photography

1336
01:42:26,625 --> 01:42:30,290
And I'll dump my rings
before the job interview

1337
01:42:30,708 --> 01:42:31,790
Deal?

1338
01:42:33,875 --> 01:42:35,665
Have the guts?

1339
01:42:35,791 --> 01:42:38,082
His Holiness is speechless

1340
01:42:44,125 --> 01:42:44,999
Let's go

1341
01:42:50,041 --> 01:42:51,374
Follow me
- Where?

1342
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,540
Let's go

1343
01:42:58,958 --> 01:43:02,082
Hey Virus! I'm anti-Virus

1344
01:43:02,166 --> 01:43:03,665
Hope no dog here

1345
01:43:03,791 --> 01:43:06,207
Cowards! Let's go

1346
01:43:06,333 --> 01:43:10,040
If any danger,
I'll give the Virus alert

1347
01:43:22,291 --> 01:43:23,874
Beware - Virus inside

1348
01:43:44,458 --> 01:43:45,665
Need background score?

1349
01:43:45,875 --> 01:43:46,874
Pia
- Who's it?

1350
01:43:49,625 --> 01:43:53,332
Don't yell! It's me, Rancho

1351
01:43:55,250 --> 01:43:58,665
Just listen for a moment,
then I'm gone

1352
01:43:58,958 --> 01:44:01,374
Say not a word...

1353
01:44:01,708 --> 01:44:02,707
Pia...
- Yes?

1354
01:44:04,833 --> 01:44:08,165
Those 22 minutes with you
on the scooter

1355
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:13,582
were the most enchanting
22 minutes of my life

1356
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:23,415
I could spend an eternity
with you on the scooter

1357
01:44:23,541 --> 01:44:24,415
Wow

1358
01:44:25,666 --> 01:44:28,790
... and time stands still

1359
01:44:29,833 --> 01:44:37,290
Every night you ride into my dreams
on your scooter, dressed as a bride

1360
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:42,582
Instead of a veil,
you lift your helmet

1361
01:44:46,041 --> 01:44:48,999
and come close to kiss me

1362
01:44:52,083 --> 01:44:54,374
But that kiss doesn't happen

1363
01:44:55,208 --> 01:44:56,124
Why?

1364
01:44:56,458 --> 01:44:59,624
Because the noses collide,
and I wake up

1365
01:45:00,708 --> 01:45:02,374
The noses never collide, stupid!

1366
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:10,582
I'm sorry,
I thought you were Pia

1367
01:45:11,166 --> 01:45:12,124
I wish I was

1368
01:45:12,416 --> 01:45:14,207
Sis, why did you interrupt?

1369
01:45:14,666 --> 01:45:16,499
It took him four years
to say this

1370
01:45:16,708 --> 01:45:19,749
Pia, kiss him.
Show that noses don't collide

1371
01:45:19,833 --> 01:45:23,082
You have my permission,
kiss him... He's so cute!

1372
01:45:23,625 --> 01:45:25,290
Who's this?
- My sister

1373
01:45:26,291 --> 01:45:27,332
Who're you?

1374
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:40,749
When you were talking,
he kicked. First time!

1375
01:45:40,791 --> 01:45:44,624
He? How do you know
it's a 'he' or 'she'?

1376
01:45:44,916 --> 01:45:48,957
Papa asked the astrologer If we'd
get an engineer or a doctor

1377
01:45:49,916 --> 01:45:50,832
Meaning?

1378
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,874
Boy becomes an engineer,
girl a doctor

1379
01:45:54,666 --> 01:46:00,165
Champ, better stay inside.
Out here's a circus

1380
01:46:01,250 --> 01:46:04,999
Your grandpa is the ringmaster.
He'll crack his whip -

1381
01:46:05,125 --> 01:46:10,540
'Run! Life is a race.
Be an engineer'

1382
01:46:11,375 --> 01:46:16,624
But you follow your heart.
If grandpa scares you...

1383
01:46:17,416 --> 01:46:20,790
put your hand on your heart
and say, 'All is well'

1384
01:46:21,666 --> 01:46:22,499
He kicked

1385
01:46:24,458 --> 01:46:25,540
Say it again

1386
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:28,374
All is well

1387
01:46:29,250 --> 01:46:30,957
Kicked again

1388
01:46:32,583 --> 01:46:35,582
Once more
- All is well

1389
01:46:40,083 --> 01:46:44,249
All is well

1390
01:46:44,791 --> 01:46:45,790
Who is it?

1391
01:46:46,625 --> 01:46:47,624
Go

1392
01:46:48,291 --> 01:46:53,332
You sent hate-mail to Dad,
here's pee-mail for you

1393
01:46:53,416 --> 01:46:57,874
Enjoy the pee-mail, happy reading!

1394
01:47:04,333 --> 01:47:07,082
Who is it?
- Your future son-in-law

1395
01:47:07,333 --> 01:47:08,832
And the wedding party

1396
01:47:09,666 --> 01:47:10,749
Rastogi!

1397
01:47:13,166 --> 01:47:14,999
Security, that way

1398
01:47:44,583 --> 01:47:48,332
So you all have already learned
about the simple pendulum

1399
01:47:49,041 --> 01:47:52,957
Now let's get down to the advanced
study about compound pendulum

1400
01:47:54,375 --> 01:47:58,374
It's an irregular object
oscillating about its own axis

1401
01:47:58,791 --> 01:47:59,874
Let me demonstrate to you

1402
01:48:00,458 --> 01:48:02,415
What's this?
- Pencil

1403
01:48:02,708 --> 01:48:04,165
What's inside?
- Lead

1404
01:48:04,208 --> 01:48:06,374
Good. Lead is the axis to this pencil

1405
01:48:06,875 --> 01:48:09,874
Even you can be a compound
pendulum, if you oscillate about...

1406
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:20,124
Where is Raju Rastogi?
- Present, sir

1407
01:48:27,583 --> 01:48:29,499
Hi. Everybody is here

1408
01:48:31,166 --> 01:48:32,249
Good morning, sir

1409
01:48:33,166 --> 01:48:34,374
Where were you last night?

1410
01:48:34,916 --> 01:48:37,999
Studying all night, sir
- Studying?

1411
01:48:38,166 --> 01:48:39,124
Really?

1412
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:42,249
Hasn't slept two nights,
that's why he looks scruffy

1413
01:48:42,333 --> 01:48:43,249
Not slept?

1414
01:48:43,416 --> 01:48:44,457
What did you study?

1415
01:48:45,541 --> 01:48:49,582
Induction motor, sir.
The whole chapter

1416
01:48:49,875 --> 01:48:50,790
Whole chapter?

1417
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,040
In that case, Mr. Raju Rastogi...

1418
01:48:53,125 --> 01:48:54,040
Yessir!

1419
01:48:54,166 --> 01:48:56,832
Can you tell us how an
induction motor starts?

1420
01:49:04,916 --> 01:49:05,832
Stop it

1421
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:15,790
Sir, rum

1422
01:49:17,666 --> 01:49:18,707
Mr. Rastogi

1423
01:49:19,166 --> 01:49:21,540
Let's have a cup of tea
in my office

1424
01:49:27,625 --> 01:49:28,582
Sir?

1425
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:30,665
Close the door

1426
01:49:35,916 --> 01:49:36,999
Can you type?

1427
01:49:38,291 --> 01:49:39,165
Yes, sir

1428
01:49:39,375 --> 01:49:40,832
Will you type a letter for me?

1429
01:49:42,916 --> 01:49:43,999
Definitely, sir

1430
01:49:44,291 --> 01:49:45,249
Come, sit

1431
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,040
Sir, I'm sorry sir...

1432
01:49:49,416 --> 01:49:50,374
Please type

1433
01:49:52,041 --> 01:49:52,874
Dear Sir...

1434
01:49:53,833 --> 01:49:57,249
It is my painful duty to inform you...

1435
01:49:58,541 --> 01:50:01,249
that your son is rusticated...

1436
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,582
No, sorry, delete that.
Go back

1437
01:50:05,291 --> 01:50:09,374
Your son, Mr. Raju Rastogi...

1438
01:50:10,458 --> 01:50:14,624
is rusticated from the
Imperial College of Engineering

1439
01:50:15,208 --> 01:50:16,624
Come on, type

1440
01:50:24,083 --> 01:50:25,790
It'll kill my dad, sir

1441
01:50:25,958 --> 01:50:27,749
Please type
- Sir, please sir

1442
01:50:28,208 --> 01:50:32,165
My decision is final and
irrevocable

1443
01:50:34,208 --> 01:50:39,374
He lives just to see me
become an engineer

1444
01:50:39,416 --> 01:50:43,707
Should've thought of that
before peeing on my door

1445
01:50:43,833 --> 01:50:48,290
Sir, give me one chance... please

1446
01:50:53,875 --> 01:50:57,290
Ok, remove your name
from the letter...

1447
01:50:58,625 --> 01:51:00,790
and put in Rancho's

1448
01:51:02,208 --> 01:51:04,415
I know he was with you
last night

1449
01:51:05,250 --> 01:51:09,332
Be my witness and
I'll spare you

1450
01:51:12,875 --> 01:51:16,915
You have 7 1/2 minutes to think

1451
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:08,957
We won't let go of you

1452
01:52:10,416 --> 01:52:15,874
We're not done yet... no way

1453
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:21,207
The heavens may beckon you

1454
01:52:21,291 --> 01:52:24,499
But we'll take up arms against God

1455
01:52:24,541 --> 01:52:30,624
And it's not a fight we intend to lose

1456
01:52:31,166 --> 01:52:34,290
You may try your best to escape

1457
01:52:34,416 --> 01:52:37,624
Try with all your might

1458
01:52:37,791 --> 01:52:44,415
But there is no way
we are letting go of you

1459
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:51,082
We won't let go of you

1460
01:52:51,541 --> 01:52:57,832
We're not done yet... no way

1461
01:52:59,666 --> 01:53:02,415
Rancho, watch that monitor

1462
01:53:02,708 --> 01:53:03,540
Raju

1463
01:53:05,291 --> 01:53:08,457
His body is paralyzed with shock,
but his mind is alert

1464
01:53:08,958 --> 01:53:13,290
He can see and hear us.
Please don't cry in front of him

1465
01:53:15,125 --> 01:53:19,540
Speak to him normally,
motivate him, joke around

1466
01:53:22,541 --> 01:53:25,207
Good news, Raju.
Your dad's recovered

1467
01:53:25,416 --> 01:53:26,790
The new medicine worked

1468
01:53:27,208 --> 01:53:30,040
Is this your family tradition -

1469
01:53:30,833 --> 01:53:33,957
As one male gets up,
the other conks out?

1470
01:53:34,125 --> 01:53:35,874
Come, wake up

1471
01:53:36,750 --> 01:53:38,165
Your dad wants Pia's scooter

1472
01:53:38,291 --> 01:53:42,124
Should I give it to him?
Hope he won't dent it

1473
01:53:48,125 --> 01:53:52,457
Raju, Farhan is live on webcam.
From the hostel

1474
01:53:54,708 --> 01:53:57,540
Look, Virus has canceled
your suspension order

1475
01:53:57,875 --> 01:54:00,124
Problem solved... Wake up now

1476
01:54:00,416 --> 01:54:03,165
Everything's resolved!
You hear that?

1477
01:54:03,541 --> 01:54:06,374
Rise and shine, buddy

1478
01:54:07,958 --> 01:54:11,165
In this journey of few strides

1479
01:54:11,375 --> 01:54:14,374
On the path called life

1480
01:54:14,541 --> 01:54:20,374
Don't quit...
Just celebrate the ride

1481
01:54:21,166 --> 01:54:24,332
Listen please to those
who love you

1482
01:54:24,458 --> 01:54:27,499
Every dark night is
followed by sunrise

1483
01:54:27,833 --> 01:54:33,082
Don't shut out those
who love you

1484
01:54:33,291 --> 01:54:39,790
We won't let go of you

1485
01:54:39,916 --> 01:54:46,249
We're not done yet... no way

1486
01:54:46,458 --> 01:54:52,874
We won't let go of you

1487
01:54:53,000 --> 01:55:00,582
We're not done yet... no way

1488
01:55:03,916 --> 01:55:07,790
Look, mom bought a new saree
- Brand new

1489
01:55:07,916 --> 01:55:09,540
It cost 2000/-

1490
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:11,457
Wake up now

1491
01:55:12,625 --> 01:55:14,749
She bought not one,
but ten sarees

1492
01:55:15,208 --> 01:55:16,124
Look!

1493
01:55:18,208 --> 01:55:19,332
Hey Raju!

1494
01:55:19,375 --> 01:55:22,415
C'mon tell me... How do I look?

1495
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:26,582
Remember the letters
mom would write...

1496
01:55:26,708 --> 01:55:29,832
Always blessed you
with eternal life

1497
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:36,124
Don't die on her... you can't die

1498
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:39,707
Look at us now, don't turn away

1499
01:55:39,833 --> 01:55:42,957
Smile once to show you care

1500
01:55:43,125 --> 01:55:47,582
Wake up,
don't torment us anymore

1501
01:55:56,458 --> 01:55:59,915
Did you hear about your sis?

1502
01:56:00,833 --> 01:56:03,540
She's getting married

1503
01:56:04,541 --> 01:56:05,874
Without any dowry

1504
01:56:06,541 --> 01:56:11,457
The bridegroom wants
nothing at all

1505
01:56:11,666 --> 01:56:15,165
He just wants Kammo

1506
01:56:15,791 --> 01:56:19,957
You know who the bridegroom is?
- Yeah

1507
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:20,874
Guess!

1508
01:56:20,916 --> 01:56:22,832
You know him very well
- Yes

1509
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:24,665
He loves animals
- Huh...?

1510
01:56:25,458 --> 01:56:27,499
He's going to be a
wildlife photographer

1511
01:56:27,583 --> 01:56:29,165
Quiet... Shhhh...

1512
01:56:29,250 --> 01:56:32,415
Didn't get it? It's our Farhan

1513
01:56:33,375 --> 01:56:37,499
Farhan will never take any dowry

1514
01:56:38,125 --> 01:56:42,499
Farhan will marry your sister

1515
01:56:42,916 --> 01:56:47,082
For free! Free! Free!

1516
01:56:48,125 --> 01:56:50,249
Raju!

1517
01:56:57,208 --> 01:57:00,999
One kilo okra, 500 grams cheese
for 'free' would've woken him

1518
01:57:01,375 --> 01:57:03,124
Why sacrifice me... !

1519
01:57:03,375 --> 01:57:05,374
Well done, buddy

1520
01:57:06,166 --> 01:57:09,707
So it's all fixed -
Farhan will marry your sister

1521
01:57:10,791 --> 01:57:11,790
Rancho

1522
01:57:14,416 --> 01:57:17,582
Rascals... Stop fibbing

1523
01:57:20,166 --> 01:57:21,207
Lucky escape!

1524
01:57:21,375 --> 01:57:27,790
We won't let go of you

1525
01:57:27,916 --> 01:57:34,374
We're not done yet... no way

1526
01:57:34,541 --> 01:57:40,915
We won't let go of you

1527
01:57:41,083 --> 01:57:47,082
We're not done yet... no way

1528
01:57:47,125 --> 01:57:53,624
We won't let go of you

1529
01:57:53,750 --> 01:58:02,124
'Okra Rs.12/ kilo'

1530
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:06,582
You called for a taxi?

1531
01:58:06,625 --> 01:58:08,415
I did
- It's waiting

1532
01:58:08,541 --> 01:58:10,040
Thank you. Why?

1533
01:58:10,458 --> 01:58:11,790
I'm going to the job interview

1534
01:58:12,041 --> 01:58:13,290
You coming with me?

1535
01:58:13,666 --> 01:58:18,290
No. I'm going for the interview.
You're going home

1536
01:58:18,416 --> 01:58:19,790
Why would I go home?

1537
01:58:21,291 --> 01:58:24,749
Remember, we promised
this rascal

1538
01:58:28,083 --> 01:58:30,165
Give me your tie

1539
01:58:31,708 --> 01:58:32,582
Why?

1540
01:58:32,791 --> 01:58:36,707
I doubt you'll go for the
interview after reading this

1541
01:58:37,625 --> 01:58:38,540
What's that?

1542
01:58:38,708 --> 01:58:41,582
A letter
- For you, from Hungary

1543
01:58:41,916 --> 01:58:44,540
Some photographer
called Andre Istvan

1544
01:58:52,458 --> 01:58:54,249
You posted my letter!

1545
01:58:54,416 --> 01:58:56,124
He loved your pictures

1546
01:58:56,583 --> 01:58:59,249
The guy wants you to assist him...

1547
01:59:00,041 --> 01:59:03,582
in the Brazilian rain forest,
for a year

1548
01:59:03,958 --> 01:59:05,540
Will pay you, too

1549
01:59:21,458 --> 01:59:22,749
Dad will never agree

1550
01:59:25,333 --> 01:59:27,999
Go speak to him...
from your heart

1551
01:59:29,666 --> 01:59:30,832
For once, dump your fears...

1552
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:37,540
or someday, on your deathbed,
you'll regret it

1553
01:59:38,041 --> 01:59:40,624
You'll remember that the letter was
in your hand, taxi at the gate...

1554
01:59:40,750 --> 01:59:44,540
With just a little courage, you
could've turned your life around

1555
01:59:51,083 --> 01:59:53,040
Do you think he'll like it?

1556
01:59:53,666 --> 01:59:55,999
Why such an expensive gift?

1557
01:59:57,125 --> 01:59:59,582
Our son's getting
his first job today

1558
02:00:00,875 --> 02:00:04,790
Don't be stingy at
such a proud moment

1559
02:00:06,708 --> 02:00:07,707
Farhan?

1560
02:00:12,791 --> 02:00:15,082
Don't you have
the job interview today?

1561
02:00:16,875 --> 02:00:17,749
I didn't go

1562
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:22,249
I don't want to be
an engineer, Dad

1563
02:00:26,458 --> 02:00:28,415
What happened?
You had an accident?

1564
02:00:32,041 --> 02:00:37,290
See that building?
I jumped from its third floor

1565
02:00:40,083 --> 02:00:40,999
Why?

1566
02:00:41,333 --> 02:00:43,665
Because I was rusticated
from college

1567
02:00:46,583 --> 02:00:47,415
Why?

1568
02:00:47,916 --> 02:00:52,749
Drunk, I urinated
on the Director's door

1569
02:00:55,041 --> 02:00:58,707
That scoundrel Rancho
is messing with your mind!

1570
02:00:58,833 --> 02:01:02,582
I don't enjoy Engineering.
I'd make a terrible engineer

1571
02:01:04,708 --> 02:01:09,332
Rancho has a simple belief -
Make your passion your profession

1572
02:01:09,666 --> 02:01:11,249
Then work will become play

1573
02:01:11,375 --> 02:01:13,290
What'll you earn in that jungle?

1574
02:01:13,916 --> 02:01:17,582
A small stipend, but I'll learn a lot

1575
02:01:17,625 --> 02:01:18,832
Five years from now...

1576
02:01:19,541 --> 02:01:24,290
when you see your friends buying
cars and homes, you'll curse yourself

1577
02:01:24,375 --> 02:01:28,374
Life as an engineer will bring
only frustration. Then I'll curse you

1578
02:01:30,416 --> 02:01:32,207
I'd rather curse myself, Dad

1579
02:01:32,333 --> 02:01:33,540
The world will laugh!

1580
02:01:34,791 --> 02:01:36,790
Label you a loser,
for quitting in the final year

1581
02:01:37,666 --> 02:01:43,374
Mr. Kapoor feels you're fortunate
to be at ICE. What'll he think?

1582
02:01:43,625 --> 02:01:45,790
Mr. Kapoor didn't provide me
with an air-conditioner

1583
02:01:48,583 --> 02:01:50,874
It wasn't Mr. Kapoor who slept
in discomfort while I slept well

1584
02:01:53,208 --> 02:01:56,207
He didn't take me around the zoo
on his shoulders

1585
02:01:59,041 --> 02:02:00,290
You did all that, Dad

1586
02:02:02,750 --> 02:02:08,207
How you feel, matters to me.
Mr. Kapoor makes no difference

1587
02:02:09,375 --> 02:02:11,249
I don't even know his first name

1588
02:02:11,375 --> 02:02:14,290
You think you're the hero
of a melodrama?

1589
02:02:14,458 --> 02:02:17,207
Enough, please... he's upset

1590
02:02:18,458 --> 02:02:20,915
God forbid, if he did
something crazy like Raju...

1591
02:02:21,125 --> 02:02:22,707
Then the discussion is over

1592
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:26,790
Don't say a word or
His Lordship will jump off the roof

1593
02:02:30,250 --> 02:02:35,249
No, Dad. I'll never attempt suicide.
I promise

1594
02:02:37,750 --> 02:02:44,749
The Rancho you detest
put this picture in my wallet

1595
02:02:46,333 --> 02:02:50,165
Told me to see it if a suicidal thought
crossed my mind

1596
02:02:50,291 --> 02:02:53,582
and imagine what'd happen
to your smiles

1597
02:02:53,625 --> 02:02:55,415
when you see my dead body

1598
02:03:00,708 --> 02:03:04,749
I want to convince you, Dad

1599
02:03:06,208 --> 02:03:08,665
but not with a suicide threat

1600
02:03:12,416 --> 02:03:16,249
Dad, what'll happen
if I become a photographer?

1601
02:03:16,541 --> 02:03:17,790
I'll earn less

1602
02:03:18,708 --> 02:03:20,415
I'll have a smaller house,
a smaller car

1603
02:03:22,458 --> 02:03:23,999
But I'll be happy

1604
02:03:25,666 --> 02:03:26,957
I will be really happy

1605
02:03:28,250 --> 02:03:29,915
Whatever I do for you
will be out of genuine love

1606
02:03:31,833 --> 02:03:33,582
I've always listened to you

1607
02:03:33,958 --> 02:03:37,082
For once,
let me listen to my heart

1608
02:03:39,166 --> 02:03:40,082
Please... Dad

1609
02:03:46,500 --> 02:03:47,457
Dad...

1610
02:03:48,666 --> 02:03:49,915
Please don't go away...

1611
02:03:56,125 --> 02:03:57,332
Return this

1612
02:04:00,833 --> 02:04:03,290
Son, what's the cost
of a professional camera?

1613
02:04:04,541 --> 02:04:06,332
Can the laptop be exchanged for it?

1614
02:04:07,791 --> 02:04:09,665
If you need more money, just ask

1615
02:04:18,458 --> 02:04:20,415
Go live your life, my son

1616
02:04:23,333 --> 02:04:27,624
Your grades are consistently poor.
Reason?

1617
02:04:28,291 --> 02:04:29,165
Fear

1618
02:04:30,250 --> 02:04:31,665
I was a good student
since childhood

1619
02:04:32,416 --> 02:04:34,582
Parents hoped
I'd end their poverty

1620
02:04:36,500 --> 02:04:37,499
That scared me

1621
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:42,499
Here I saw the mad race.
You don't count if you're not first

1622
02:04:44,208 --> 02:04:45,249
My fear grew

1623
02:04:46,916 --> 02:04:48,374
Fear is not good for grades, sir

1624
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,415
I slipped on more
charms and rings

1625
02:04:52,416 --> 02:04:56,874
Prayed to God for favors.
No... begged for favors

1626
02:04:59,958 --> 02:05:03,082
16 broken bones gave me
two months to think and reflect

1627
02:05:03,625 --> 02:05:04,874
Finally, sense dawned

1628
02:05:06,375 --> 02:05:11,540
Today I didn't beg God for this job,
just thanked him for this life

1629
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:17,999
If you reject me, no regrets

1630
02:05:18,333 --> 02:05:22,457
I'll still do something
worthwhile with my life

1631
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:28,207
Such frank behavior
is not good for our firm

1632
02:05:28,791 --> 02:05:33,082
We need someone diplomatic
to handle clients

1633
02:05:33,166 --> 02:05:35,540
You're too straightforward

1634
02:05:37,416 --> 02:05:38,249
But...

1635
02:05:39,416 --> 02:05:45,874
if you assure us
you'll control this attitude

1636
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,999
we may consider you

1637
02:05:52,333 --> 02:05:55,499
It took two broken legs
to get me up on my feet

1638
02:05:57,375 --> 02:05:59,207
Wasn't easy to get this attitude

1639
02:05:59,916 --> 02:06:00,790
Can't change it, sir

1640
02:06:04,458 --> 02:06:09,707
You keep your job...
I'll keep my attitude

1641
02:06:09,833 --> 02:06:11,207
I'm sorry, no offense, sir

1642
02:06:15,583 --> 02:06:16,457
Wait

1643
02:06:18,416 --> 02:06:22,415
I've interviewed countless
candidates for 25 years

1644
02:06:22,833 --> 02:06:25,707
Everyone turns into
a yes-man to get the job

1645
02:06:25,875 --> 02:06:27,249
Where did you spring from, son?

1646
02:06:29,166 --> 02:06:29,999
Sir?

1647
02:06:30,250 --> 02:06:32,874
Shall we discuss the salary?

1648
02:06:40,416 --> 02:06:41,332
Thank you, sir

1649
02:07:13,875 --> 02:07:18,082
Your Majesty, thou art great

1650
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:21,665
Accept this humble offering

1651
02:07:58,250 --> 02:08:01,707
Govind!

1652
02:08:03,750 --> 02:08:07,249
You had said, 'If he gets a job,
shave it off'

1653
02:08:14,458 --> 02:08:15,499
What have you done?

1654
02:08:19,083 --> 02:08:22,499
I feel naked without
my moustache

1655
02:08:24,791 --> 02:08:26,707
I've lost my dignity

1656
02:08:28,791 --> 02:08:31,249
I won't accept defeat, Rastogi

1657
02:08:32,541 --> 02:08:36,582
The job isn't yours until you
pass your final exam

1658
02:08:38,041 --> 02:08:41,999
And this time,
I will set the question paper

1659
02:08:45,208 --> 02:08:47,790
Dad, that's not fair

1660
02:08:50,125 --> 02:08:53,665
Everything is fair in
Love and War

1661
02:08:54,166 --> 02:08:57,499
And this is World War... III

1662
02:08:58,958 --> 02:08:59,999
Rastogi, you're dead meat!

1663
02:09:04,958 --> 02:09:05,874
Hey

1664
02:09:08,291 --> 02:09:09,207
What're you doing here?

1665
02:09:12,166 --> 02:09:13,040
Be careful

1666
02:09:18,708 --> 02:09:22,582
You've been drinking
- Yup, had to down a couple

1667
02:09:23,125 --> 02:09:25,332
A couple too many!

1668
02:09:25,416 --> 02:09:27,332
Needed the guts
- For what?

1669
02:09:29,083 --> 02:09:30,624
For stealing this
- What's this?

1670
02:09:31,708 --> 02:09:35,874
The duplicate key to
Virus's office

1671
02:09:38,375 --> 02:09:40,707
The question paper's
in a cover with a red seal

1672
02:09:41,375 --> 02:09:45,374
Dad has set it, to fail Raju

1673
02:09:45,666 --> 02:09:46,624
Go get it!

1674
02:09:47,666 --> 02:09:50,249
Are you mad or what -
that's cheating!

1675
02:09:54,708 --> 02:09:57,957
Everything's fair in
Love and War

1676
02:09:59,458 --> 02:10:00,499
Tell me something...

1677
02:10:02,416 --> 02:10:03,624
Do you really feel...

1678
02:10:05,166 --> 02:10:10,707
the noses collide while kissing?

1679
02:10:16,125 --> 02:10:19,874
Wait. Have some dhokla

1680
02:10:22,333 --> 02:10:24,957
You Gujaratis are so cute

1681
02:10:25,875 --> 02:10:29,207
But why does your food
sound so dangerous?

1682
02:10:30,291 --> 02:10:35,540
Dhokla, Fafda, Handwa,
Thepla, Khakhra

1683
02:10:36,666 --> 02:10:38,790
Sound like missiles

1684
02:10:38,833 --> 02:10:39,707
C'mon

1685
02:10:39,916 --> 02:10:42,415
'Today Bush dropped
two Dhoklas on Iraq'

1686
02:10:43,041 --> 02:10:45,915
'400 dead, 200 injured'

1687
02:10:46,250 --> 02:10:47,165
C'mon

1688
02:10:50,625 --> 02:10:51,624
Oh...

1689
02:10:53,125 --> 02:10:57,582
I can deal with Khakhra, Fafda.
But your name...

1690
02:10:58,500 --> 02:11:01,832
'Ranchhoddas Shamaldas
Chanchad' - Yuck

1691
02:11:03,041 --> 02:11:05,624
I won't change my last name
after marriage

1692
02:11:07,458 --> 02:11:10,457
Pia, we can't get married

1693
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:14,915
Why?

1694
02:11:15,750 --> 02:11:17,207
Is there someone else?

1695
02:11:19,708 --> 02:11:20,582
No

1696
02:11:20,875 --> 02:11:22,624
Are you gay?
- No

1697
02:11:24,458 --> 02:11:26,374
Then why don't you
propose to me?

1698
02:11:30,916 --> 02:11:32,374
Are you impotent?
- No

1699
02:11:35,041 --> 02:11:36,874
Then prove it

1700
02:11:37,333 --> 02:11:38,290
Pia, no

1701
02:11:38,541 --> 02:11:39,999
Stop, stop!

1702
02:11:40,166 --> 02:11:42,540
What happened?
- We didn't inform Pia

1703
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,082
Stop here,
my bladders are bursting

1704
02:11:45,125 --> 02:11:46,999
Shut up!
- Are you in touch with her?

1705
02:11:47,291 --> 02:11:50,457
No... I have her home number
Then call her, I'll stop

1706
02:11:56,916 --> 02:11:57,749
Hello

1707
02:11:57,833 --> 02:12:00,082
No place for urine-expulsion
in this country

1708
02:12:00,125 --> 02:12:03,540
Hello, is Pia there?
- No, she's not

1709
02:12:03,916 --> 02:12:05,707
Is she at the hospital?

1710
02:12:05,833 --> 02:12:07,415
Why would she be there?

1711
02:12:07,625 --> 02:12:09,832
She's getting married today
- in Manali

1712
02:12:17,833 --> 02:12:19,082
Too late! She's married

1713
02:12:20,500 --> 02:12:23,415
Not yet. It's a six hour drive

1714
02:12:23,750 --> 02:12:25,832
If we rush, we'll reach
before the vows

1715
02:12:26,333 --> 02:12:27,207
What do you say?

1716
02:12:29,166 --> 02:12:31,582
It's a no-brainer. Let's turn back

1717
02:12:31,791 --> 02:12:33,540
No turning back

1718
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,749
Straight to Ladakh.
We'll meet Rancho and return

1719
02:12:36,916 --> 02:12:39,499
I have a Friday meeting with
Phunsukh Wangdu

1720
02:12:39,625 --> 02:12:41,165
Get into the car

1721
02:12:41,416 --> 02:12:44,582
If I miss my meeting,
the Japanese will get him

1722
02:12:44,958 --> 02:12:47,374
They're offering him a
first name in the company

1723
02:12:47,500 --> 02:12:50,499
'Phunsukh and Fujiyashi',
profit sharing...

1724
02:13:23,708 --> 02:13:25,874
Pia weds Suhas!
- Thanks for the suit

1725
02:13:28,208 --> 02:13:29,707
Virus will have a heart attack

1726
02:13:30,791 --> 02:13:33,499
At every daughter's wedding,
we're there to rock the party

1727
02:13:34,916 --> 02:13:38,332
Listen, I'll update Pia,
you peel off the price tag

1728
02:13:55,125 --> 02:13:57,374
Farhan
- We found Rancho

1729
02:14:05,500 --> 02:14:07,124
For Room 107?
- Yes, sir

1730
02:14:07,833 --> 02:14:10,665
You've taken ages.
- Sorry, sir

1731
02:14:10,791 --> 02:14:11,665
Off, now

1732
02:14:20,708 --> 02:14:22,415
Housekeeping, sir
- Come in

1733
02:14:22,958 --> 02:14:25,582
Amore... Amore...

1734
02:14:25,666 --> 02:14:27,040
Quick, iron my coat

1735
02:14:27,125 --> 02:14:29,999
Amore... Amore...

1736
02:14:30,833 --> 02:14:34,082
We found Rancho!
Now you can't marry this ass

1737
02:14:34,583 --> 02:14:35,665
You're mad, Farhan

1738
02:14:36,791 --> 02:14:39,457
Don't fool yourself, Pia.
You still love Rancho

1739
02:14:39,666 --> 02:14:41,624
You're still eating his favorite food

1740
02:14:41,916 --> 02:14:44,582
Amore... Amore...

1741
02:14:59,958 --> 02:15:04,165
He's incorrigible.
Once a price tag, always a price tag

1742
02:15:04,250 --> 02:15:07,124
Shut up, Farhan.
Suhas is a changed man

1743
02:15:07,666 --> 02:15:09,665
He doesn't speak of
brands and prices anymore

1744
02:15:09,708 --> 02:15:12,915
My 150,000/ - coat

1745
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,124
Why do you people eat sauce?

1746
02:15:15,166 --> 02:15:17,665
I'll sort it out, sir
- How?

1747
02:15:17,750 --> 02:15:20,332
Our laundry specializes in
cleaning mint-stained suits

1748
02:15:20,458 --> 02:15:22,457
I'll clean it in a jiffy

1749
02:15:27,750 --> 02:15:29,082
Get it soon

1750
02:15:30,041 --> 02:15:32,290
But it's too late now, Farhan
- Pia

1751
02:15:33,166 --> 02:15:35,415
Let's go, Pia, we're late

1752
02:15:46,833 --> 02:15:50,207
Pia, it's me... Raju.
Don't yell, they'll kill me

1753
02:15:55,333 --> 02:15:56,249
Where is Suhas?

1754
02:15:56,291 --> 02:15:59,040
Housekeeping took my coat

1755
02:15:59,500 --> 02:16:01,290
Go... Send Suhas here

1756
02:16:01,500 --> 02:16:04,707
It's rude to leave the ceremony

1757
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:17,665
Yeah, Farhan?
- The car's ready

1758
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,624
Grab her hand and run.
Don't move

1759
02:16:22,125 --> 02:16:23,749
Sir...
- My coat?

1760
02:16:23,791 --> 02:16:24,957
You're here...

1761
02:16:25,125 --> 02:16:26,749
So who's at the altar?
- Altar?

1762
02:16:29,041 --> 02:16:31,540
Another couple of rounds,
and we'll be considered married

1763
02:16:31,708 --> 02:16:33,999
I'm already married, Pia.
Let's go

1764
02:16:34,458 --> 02:16:37,749
It's too late.
People will laugh at me

1765
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:39,790
So you'll commit suicide?

1766
02:16:40,375 --> 02:16:41,290
Rastogi!

1767
02:16:41,375 --> 02:16:43,499
People will gossip briefly,
then forget

1768
02:16:44,875 --> 02:16:47,874
But you... you'll regret
on your deathbed

1769
02:16:47,958 --> 02:16:50,749
that the car was at the gate,
Rancho within reach...

1770
02:16:51,083 --> 02:16:54,582
but in fear of people,
you married this ass

1771
02:16:56,750 --> 02:16:57,707
Housekeeping?

1772
02:17:37,416 --> 02:17:40,457
Pia, minor problem

1773
02:17:40,750 --> 02:17:41,665
What?

1774
02:17:42,041 --> 02:17:43,665
We don't know if Rancho's married

1775
02:17:43,750 --> 02:17:44,582
What!

1776
02:17:44,666 --> 02:17:47,332
He won't be married
- And if he is?

1777
02:17:48,208 --> 02:17:49,624
Then we'll drop you back

1778
02:17:50,500 --> 02:17:54,290
Relax! Handmade biscuit?

1779
02:17:58,125 --> 02:17:58,999
What's he doing here?

1780
02:18:00,041 --> 02:18:03,457
Ignore him
- The biscuit's very good

1781
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:06,374
Till yesterday,
I was a law-abiding citizen

1782
02:18:06,875 --> 02:18:10,749
But in the last 24 hours,
I'd grounded an aircraft

1783
02:18:11,541 --> 02:18:13,999
almost assigned Shamaldas's
ashes to the sewers, and

1784
02:18:14,250 --> 02:18:18,665
made a bride elope from her
own wedding! All for Rancho

1785
02:18:20,125 --> 02:18:22,249
But he too would do
anything for friends

1786
02:18:22,500 --> 02:18:25,999
Like stealing the question paper...
from the lion's den

1787
02:18:26,083 --> 02:18:27,124
Envelope with the red seal

1788
02:18:28,125 --> 02:18:33,124
He feared that if Raju failed,
there'd be another high jump

1789
02:18:36,291 --> 02:18:41,582
We were principled thieves,
stealing the paper only for Raju

1790
02:18:41,958 --> 02:18:43,082
We'd sworn we won't even
take a peek

1791
02:18:45,791 --> 02:18:47,124
Where's it hidden...

1792
02:18:47,291 --> 02:18:50,915
We'll grow old searching!
Ask Pia

1793
02:18:57,125 --> 02:18:58,290
Pia, your phone

1794
02:18:59,541 --> 02:19:02,790
Mr. Papa-To-Be!
If you say 'All is well', he kicks

1795
02:19:02,875 --> 02:19:03,707
He kicked

1796
02:19:06,166 --> 02:19:07,665
Pia, your phone

1797
02:19:13,500 --> 02:19:14,749
Found it! Rancho

1798
02:19:16,208 --> 02:19:17,207
Hello?

1799
02:19:35,625 --> 02:19:37,874
Quick, photocopy this

1800
02:19:58,958 --> 02:19:59,832
Where was it?

1801
02:20:00,125 --> 02:20:01,124
Put it back

1802
02:20:24,458 --> 02:20:26,499
We're safe!
- Where were you?

1803
02:20:31,083 --> 02:20:32,790
Here
- What's this?

1804
02:20:33,125 --> 02:20:34,040
A gift

1805
02:20:35,166 --> 02:20:39,082
Question paper.
Virus set it himself, to fail you

1806
02:20:46,666 --> 02:20:47,999
Strange buddies!

1807
02:20:49,333 --> 02:20:53,915
First teach you to be upright,
then offer a path to shame

1808
02:20:55,958 --> 02:20:56,999
No way

1809
02:20:58,583 --> 02:20:59,957
If I pass,
it'll be on my own steam

1810
02:21:03,833 --> 02:21:04,999
If I don't, it's still ok

1811
02:21:22,208 --> 02:21:26,749
He'd won us over!
I felt like embracing him as family...

1812
02:21:27,666 --> 02:21:29,582
but then I controlled my emotions

1813
02:21:48,666 --> 02:21:51,665
Damn thief
- Sir, please, sir

1814
02:21:51,791 --> 02:21:54,999
Rascal
- Sorry sir

1815
02:21:55,541 --> 02:21:56,832
Wanted to change the system

1816
02:21:58,541 --> 02:22:03,499
You'll pee on my door
- Sir, what're you doing

1817
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:05,999
Sorry sir

1818
02:22:07,458 --> 02:22:09,332
You are rusticated!

1819
02:22:10,125 --> 02:22:13,124
If all of you aren't out by morning,
I'll call the police

1820
02:22:13,541 --> 02:22:14,874
I will call the police!

1821
02:22:17,375 --> 02:22:18,207
Rascals!

1822
02:22:18,541 --> 02:22:19,874
Rascals, all of you

1823
02:22:23,875 --> 02:22:26,207
How did he get my office key?

1824
02:22:27,500 --> 02:22:28,915
I gave him the key, Dad

1825
02:22:30,291 --> 02:22:33,915
I wish I'd given this key to
my brother... He'd be alive today

1826
02:22:34,083 --> 02:22:34,999
Stop it, Pia

1827
02:22:36,125 --> 02:22:38,957
You think your son
fell off a train and died?

1828
02:22:39,500 --> 02:22:40,415
Shut up, Pia

1829
02:22:40,500 --> 02:22:42,790
You decided he'd be an engineer

1830
02:22:42,958 --> 02:22:45,249
Did you ever ask him
what he wanted to be?

1831
02:22:46,041 --> 02:22:47,624
You put such pressure on him...

1832
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,290
that he chose death
over the entrance exam

1833
02:22:54,541 --> 02:22:55,415
I don't understand...

1834
02:22:56,208 --> 02:22:58,790
Dad, you go to your room

1835
02:23:02,666 --> 02:23:05,040
Pia, don't do this

1836
02:23:07,500 --> 02:23:11,415
He wanted to study Literature,
be a writer

1837
02:23:13,666 --> 02:23:16,165
But all he wrote was
this suicide note

1838
02:23:16,208 --> 02:23:17,499
Put that away, please

1839
02:23:17,666 --> 02:23:19,332
No more cover-ups!

1840
02:23:22,708 --> 02:23:25,957
Just once...

1841
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:29,707
if you'd said - Don't do Engineering
if you don't want to

1842
02:23:30,541 --> 02:23:31,957
just do what your heart is in

1843
02:23:33,416 --> 02:23:35,165
then he'd be alive today

1844
02:23:43,083 --> 02:23:45,165
He didn't commit suicide

1845
02:23:45,875 --> 02:23:46,874
You're right, Dad

1846
02:23:48,416 --> 02:23:49,665
It wasn't suicide...

1847
02:23:52,125 --> 02:23:53,207
It was murder

1848
02:24:09,125 --> 02:24:11,999
Many city roads are
completely submerged

1849
02:24:12,041 --> 02:24:14,040
Traffic has come to a standstill

1850
02:24:27,958 --> 02:24:31,790
Dad...

1851
02:24:32,875 --> 02:24:33,832
Mona?

1852
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,499
Go back, Millimeter.
Why're you following us?

1853
02:24:41,041 --> 02:24:43,332
Why?
Your pop owns the road?

1854
02:24:43,458 --> 02:24:45,165
Please help,
we are desperate here!

1855
02:24:46,125 --> 02:24:47,999
You can't send an ambulance?

1856
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:50,915
Get it from another hospital

1857
02:24:51,541 --> 02:24:55,082
The entire city's flooded, sir.
We're helpless

1858
02:24:58,583 --> 02:24:59,874
Mona, you ok?

1859
02:25:00,416 --> 02:25:01,415
Rancho, Pia

1860
02:25:03,791 --> 02:25:07,665
Rancho, you can't reach here.
Do as I say

1861
02:25:07,958 --> 02:25:12,832
The water bag has burst

1862
02:25:13,833 --> 02:25:16,374
Disconnected! Mona

1863
02:25:21,583 --> 02:25:22,582
Mona!

1864
02:25:26,958 --> 02:25:28,499
Turn on the lights
- Where to?

1865
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:32,957
To the table tennis table
- Pia, we're in the common room

1866
02:25:36,916 --> 02:25:38,790
Raju, turn on the web camera

1867
02:25:44,916 --> 02:25:46,082
Where's Mona? Show me

1868
02:25:47,625 --> 02:25:48,582
Hold on

1869
02:25:50,791 --> 02:25:51,665
Here, Pia

1870
02:25:51,958 --> 02:25:54,874
Mona, don't worry. I'm with you

1871
02:25:54,958 --> 02:25:55,957
Pia, I'm dying!

1872
02:25:56,333 --> 02:25:58,957
Rancho, even when
there were no hospitals or docs

1873
02:25:59,083 --> 02:26:00,499
babies were delivered

1874
02:26:01,083 --> 02:26:03,415
You all will deliver this baby

1875
02:26:06,083 --> 02:26:07,665
All is well

1876
02:26:07,791 --> 02:26:10,790
How dare you? I'll kill you

1877
02:26:10,916 --> 02:26:12,957
Dad, stay out of this

1878
02:26:13,916 --> 02:26:16,082
Farhan, get towels and scissors

1879
02:26:16,125 --> 02:26:18,624
Millimeter, get clothes clips
and hot water

1880
02:26:18,875 --> 02:26:20,374
Rancho, cover Mona

1881
02:26:27,916 --> 02:26:29,457
Mona, try pushing

1882
02:26:29,875 --> 02:26:33,832
Push with all your might

1883
02:26:34,083 --> 02:26:36,499
Stop it! I can't do it

1884
02:26:36,708 --> 02:26:38,540
Rancho, check if there's crowning

1885
02:26:39,458 --> 02:26:40,332
Crowning...?

1886
02:26:41,666 --> 02:26:42,582
Get that diagram

1887
02:26:45,500 --> 02:26:48,249
See if the head is coming out

1888
02:26:50,583 --> 02:26:51,915
Check quickly

1889
02:26:52,708 --> 02:26:53,624
Go!

1890
02:26:54,291 --> 02:26:56,790
Go, Rancho, go

1891
02:27:04,041 --> 02:27:06,165
No crowning

1892
02:27:06,250 --> 02:27:08,124
Mona, please push

1893
02:27:10,791 --> 02:27:11,665
Mona!

1894
02:27:14,666 --> 02:27:15,832
She's tired, Pia

1895
02:27:16,250 --> 02:27:19,957
Wake her! If she won't push,
it's a big problem

1896
02:27:20,291 --> 02:27:24,082
They need a vacuum cup
- Where will they get one?

1897
02:27:24,250 --> 02:27:27,124
What's a vacuum cup?
How is it used?

1898
02:27:27,375 --> 02:27:28,249
I'll show you

1899
02:27:31,500 --> 02:27:35,832
If the mother's too fatigued to push,
a cup is placed on baby's head

1900
02:27:36,125 --> 02:27:39,915
Suction makes the cup
stick to the head...

1901
02:27:40,625 --> 02:27:42,499
and the baby is pulled out

1902
02:27:42,958 --> 02:27:45,165
I can make this
- How?

1903
02:27:45,416 --> 02:27:47,249
With a vacuum cleaner
- Vacuum cleaner?

1904
02:27:47,291 --> 02:27:48,374
Yes

1905
02:27:48,416 --> 02:27:50,790
That pressure's too high

1906
02:27:50,833 --> 02:27:52,999
I'll control it
- D'you have a vacuum cleaner?

1907
02:27:53,041 --> 02:27:54,124
Yes, in my office

1908
02:27:54,541 --> 02:27:57,290
Farhan, rush and get it
- Here's the key

1909
02:28:03,250 --> 02:28:06,707
Mona, push

1910
02:28:07,458 --> 02:28:08,999
Oh my God

1911
02:28:09,875 --> 02:28:10,790
What happened?

1912
02:28:15,666 --> 02:28:17,957
Raju, what happened?
- The power's gone

1913
02:28:18,916 --> 02:28:20,374
How'll the vacuum work now?

1914
02:28:20,416 --> 02:28:22,999
Farhan, you get the vacuum,
I'll get the power.

1915
02:28:23,041 --> 02:28:24,040
How?

1916
02:28:24,708 --> 02:28:26,207
Millimeter, get Virus out

1917
02:28:27,583 --> 02:28:30,249
What nonsense is this!

1918
02:28:30,458 --> 02:28:34,040
Not this Virus.
My Virus, the inverter

1919
02:28:34,208 --> 02:28:36,124
Get that, quick
- Ok

1920
02:28:36,375 --> 02:28:38,540
Raju, wake up the hostel

1921
02:28:38,708 --> 02:28:41,665
Get car batteries, wires,
and a vacuum gauge

1922
02:28:44,500 --> 02:28:47,165
Emergency in the common room!

1923
02:29:17,958 --> 02:29:20,082
Where's Rancho?
- Here, sir

1924
02:29:20,333 --> 02:29:23,040
Keep the batteries here
... and the wires

1925
02:29:25,291 --> 02:29:28,499
Raju, switch off everything,
connect the inverter to the mains

1926
02:29:33,291 --> 02:29:34,499
Rancho, vacuum cleaner

1927
02:29:35,625 --> 02:29:38,540
Farhan, get your lens cleaner

1928
02:29:38,583 --> 02:29:40,040
Blower?
- Yeah, get it

1929
02:29:42,750 --> 02:29:43,790
Rancho, blower

1930
02:29:43,916 --> 02:29:45,957
Good. Fix this to the gauge

1931
02:30:12,333 --> 02:30:13,624
Rancho, I'm done

1932
02:30:16,041 --> 02:30:17,207
All switches off?
- Yes

1933
02:30:18,750 --> 02:30:20,374
Hit the table
and computer switches

1934
02:30:20,416 --> 02:30:21,290
Ok

1935
02:30:33,958 --> 02:30:35,082
Raju, turn on the computer

1936
02:30:35,458 --> 02:30:37,165
Farhan, here

1937
02:30:39,250 --> 02:30:41,290
Pia, come here quick

1938
02:30:43,750 --> 02:30:44,874
Love you, Rancho

1939
02:30:45,625 --> 02:30:47,624
Farhan, turn it on
- Ok

1940
02:30:54,166 --> 02:30:56,207
Pia, how much suction?

1941
02:30:56,583 --> 02:30:58,040
Not more than 0.5

1942
02:30:58,250 --> 02:31:00,290
Farhan, 0.5
- Cover it

1943
02:31:01,833 --> 02:31:02,749
0.5

1944
02:31:05,291 --> 02:31:09,332
Vacuum cleaner baby!
Mother of all deliveries

1945
02:31:10,416 --> 02:31:11,249
Farhan, stop

1946
02:31:11,291 --> 02:31:12,124
Ok

1947
02:31:18,541 --> 02:31:19,874
Raju, get on the table

1948
02:31:20,125 --> 02:31:23,290
Push the baby down, like this

1949
02:31:23,458 --> 02:31:24,415
Ok

1950
02:31:25,500 --> 02:31:26,415
Farhan, turn it on

1951
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,332
C'mon, you can do it

1952
02:31:34,458 --> 02:31:36,915
C'mon, push

1953
02:31:41,083 --> 02:31:43,665
Do it for Champ

1954
02:31:43,875 --> 02:31:46,332
C'mon, Mona

1955
02:31:48,041 --> 02:31:50,124
He's coming out!

1956
02:31:51,458 --> 02:31:53,249
You can do it

1957
02:31:54,041 --> 02:31:56,415
Yes Mona, push

1958
02:32:04,250 --> 02:32:05,332
Farhan, turn it off

1959
02:32:05,416 --> 02:32:06,457
Ok, off

1960
02:32:26,708 --> 02:32:28,499
Two clips,
cut the umbilical cord

1961
02:32:28,791 --> 02:32:30,999
Farhan, two clips on the cord

1962
02:32:31,708 --> 02:32:33,749
Get scissors
- Be careful

1963
02:32:34,958 --> 02:32:37,249
Cut at the center,
get a towel

1964
02:32:40,041 --> 02:32:42,374
Pia, he's not crying

1965
02:32:46,625 --> 02:32:49,540
Hey Champ!

1966
02:32:50,875 --> 02:32:53,332
Rancho, rub his back

1967
02:32:55,583 --> 02:32:57,624
Hey Champ
- Come on, Champ

1968
02:32:59,458 --> 02:33:01,582
No, nothing

1969
02:33:02,041 --> 02:33:03,082
Blow air into his mouth

1970
02:33:10,250 --> 02:33:11,082
C'mon, Champ

1971
02:33:16,625 --> 02:33:17,499
No response

1972
02:33:41,833 --> 02:33:45,457
Hush Mona, say -
All is well

1973
02:33:50,708 --> 02:33:51,665
He kicked

1974
02:33:52,958 --> 02:33:53,832
What?

1975
02:33:54,708 --> 02:33:55,999
He kicked

1976
02:33:59,458 --> 02:34:00,790
Say - All is well

1977
02:34:02,416 --> 02:34:09,332
All is well

1978
02:34:50,750 --> 02:34:54,124
If Virus had said, 'My grandson
will be an engineer'

1979
02:34:54,250 --> 02:34:56,124
I would've broken his jaw

1980
02:34:56,791 --> 02:34:59,624
But when he finally spoke,
he stunned us

1981
02:34:59,916 --> 02:35:03,082
What a kick!
Wanna be a footballer?

1982
02:35:04,125 --> 02:35:07,165
Be what you want to be

1983
02:35:23,625 --> 02:35:27,540
Wait - I've not finished with you!

1984
02:35:29,916 --> 02:35:32,499
First day of college,
you'd asked me a question...

1985
02:35:32,833 --> 02:35:35,249
Why didn't astronauts
use a pencil in space?

1986
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,290
If a pencil tip breaks

1987
02:35:38,458 --> 02:35:44,374
it'd float in zero gravity.
Get into eyes, nose, instruments...

1988
02:35:44,500 --> 02:35:46,457
You were wrong

1989
02:35:48,041 --> 02:35:49,915
You cannot be right all the time

1990
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:53,040
You understand?

1991
02:35:55,458 --> 02:35:56,332
Yes, sir

1992
02:35:57,583 --> 02:35:59,707
This was an important invention

1993
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:02,040
You understand?

1994
02:36:03,416 --> 02:36:04,290
Yes, sir

1995
02:36:06,833 --> 02:36:15,249
My Director said, 'When you find
an extraordinary student...'

1996
02:36:34,083 --> 02:36:38,540
Go, study!
Pass your exams and leave

1997
02:36:47,416 --> 02:36:49,540
And now, Student of the Year...

1998
02:36:49,750 --> 02:36:52,249
Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad

1999
02:37:09,875 --> 02:37:11,207
Sir, one photo

2000
02:37:28,666 --> 02:37:32,124
I wanted to capture all these
memories and take them home

2001
02:37:34,166 --> 02:37:39,582
That day, we hugged,
we rejoiced, we cried...

2002
02:37:39,833 --> 02:37:41,499
We vowed that we'd meet
at least once a year...

2003
02:37:42,166 --> 02:37:45,624
Who knew then, we were seeing
Rancho for the last time

2004
02:38:19,541 --> 02:38:20,499
Untie him

2005
02:38:23,833 --> 02:38:25,749
I'll sue you all in an
American court

2006
02:38:40,208 --> 02:38:41,082
Raju

2007
02:39:00,083 --> 02:39:02,082
Only Rancho can create
a school like this

2008
02:39:02,625 --> 02:39:03,707
But where is he?

2009
02:39:08,166 --> 02:39:09,415
Don't pee here

2010
02:39:10,500 --> 02:39:12,124
Go away creatures

2011
02:39:12,500 --> 02:39:15,582
Don't pee here
- I'll smack you

2012
02:39:33,333 --> 02:39:35,540
Bingo! He cannot be far

2013
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,290
Excuse me,
where is Ranchhoddas?

2014
02:39:49,416 --> 02:39:51,415
He's not Ranchhoddas!
- Rancho...

2015
02:39:51,500 --> 02:39:53,707
Chhote... Dammit,
what's his name?

2016
02:39:53,833 --> 02:39:56,540
Calm down. Come with me

2017
02:39:59,000 --> 02:39:59,915
Where's he?
- Rancho

2018
02:40:07,291 --> 02:40:10,457
Farhan, he's read all your books

2019
02:40:16,750 --> 02:40:22,790
Raju, he reads your blog everyday.
Proudly shares it with the kids

2020
02:40:26,291 --> 02:40:29,790
Remember your helmet, Pia?
It was stolen...

2021
02:40:31,708 --> 02:40:34,915
Who are you?
How do you know us?

2022
02:40:35,166 --> 02:40:37,249
Didn't you recognize me?
- No

2023
02:40:38,166 --> 02:40:42,165
How would you?
Millimeter is now Centimeter

2024
02:40:47,208 --> 02:40:51,707
Not Centimeter, you're Kilometer

2025
02:40:52,541 --> 02:40:53,540
How did you get here?

2026
02:40:53,625 --> 02:40:56,874
I got a letter with
a train ticket inside

2027
02:40:57,125 --> 02:41:00,874
It said - 'Miss being in school?
Catch this train'... I did

2028
02:41:02,458 --> 02:41:03,582
That rascal Rancho!

2029
02:41:07,750 --> 02:41:08,749
Where is that idiot?

2030
02:41:19,916 --> 02:41:21,832
Dorje, you fly it

2031
02:41:36,791 --> 02:41:42,290
Every night you ride into my dreams
on a scooter, dressed as a bride

2032
02:41:43,208 --> 02:41:45,499
Instead of a veil,
you lift your helmet

2033
02:41:46,125 --> 02:41:48,874
and come close to kiss me

2034
02:41:52,458 --> 02:41:53,707
Couldn't you tell me
before leaving?

2035
02:41:56,041 --> 02:41:56,874
No

2036
02:41:58,666 --> 02:41:59,582
Sorry

2037
02:41:59,958 --> 02:42:00,790
Did you marry?

2038
02:42:01,375 --> 02:42:05,624
What? No

2039
02:42:06,583 --> 02:42:09,207
You?
- Almost... Idiot

2040
02:42:16,791 --> 02:42:17,665
So?

2041
02:42:19,125 --> 02:42:20,124
So what?

2042
02:42:20,625 --> 02:42:21,957
Do you love someone?

2043
02:42:26,375 --> 02:42:27,207
Yes

2044
02:42:33,250 --> 02:42:34,124
Who?

2045
02:42:35,416 --> 02:42:36,290
You

2046
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:05,207
See, the noses don't collide,
stupid

2047
02:43:06,416 --> 02:43:07,249
That's right!

2048
02:43:07,500 --> 02:43:08,624
Rancho

2049
02:43:10,125 --> 02:43:10,999
Hi... Farhan!

2050
02:43:11,166 --> 02:43:13,290
Screw your 'Hi'

2051
02:43:13,708 --> 02:43:18,457
Hey, listen to me...
- No, you listen to me

2052
02:43:18,625 --> 02:43:20,915
I can explain everything

2053
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:22,874
Hi... Raju!

2054
02:43:22,916 --> 02:43:24,832
How we hunted for you!

2055
02:43:27,708 --> 02:43:31,832
Didn't have a coin
for one phone call?

2056
02:43:33,875 --> 02:43:36,165
Add a couple from me too

2057
02:43:36,708 --> 02:43:41,915
Rascal, scoundrel
- Let him go now

2058
02:43:42,041 --> 02:43:42,999
Ok ok, enough

2059
02:43:44,333 --> 02:43:46,124
On your feet, c'mon

2060
02:44:16,125 --> 02:44:17,874
Having fun, idiots?

2061
02:44:18,125 --> 02:44:19,999
Hey... Hi Chatur

2062
02:44:20,291 --> 02:44:25,374
Ranchhoddas Chanchad.
How do you do, Mr. Teacher?

2063
02:44:25,791 --> 02:44:32,582
Wow, you're a teacher in a village -
A for Apple, B for Ball...

2064
02:44:34,500 --> 02:44:39,249
Our trains left together.
But yours traveled in reverse...

2065
02:44:39,791 --> 02:44:42,707
from engineer to primary teacher

2066
02:44:44,875 --> 02:44:47,790
What's your salary, Chanchad?
5000/-?

2067
02:44:48,166 --> 02:44:49,957
For me that's $ 100

2068
02:44:50,375 --> 02:44:53,790
My son's pocket money is
more than your salary

2069
02:44:53,958 --> 02:44:56,749
Cut the crap
- Crap is what he gave us

2070
02:44:56,916 --> 02:45:01,999
Wanted to change the education
system, change the world

2071
02:45:02,208 --> 02:45:04,790
Finally what does he change?
Kids' diapers

2072
02:45:05,250 --> 02:45:06,665
You gonna break his jaw
or should I?

2073
02:45:06,833 --> 02:45:07,749
Just relax

2074
02:45:07,833 --> 02:45:14,624
Remember I'd said
one day you'd cry and I'd laugh?

2075
02:45:16,291 --> 02:45:23,082
Sign here.
Accept - You lost, I won!

2076
02:45:23,333 --> 02:45:26,374
'Declaration of Defeat'!
Unbelievable, man

2077
02:45:26,541 --> 02:45:28,624
Chatur
- Crazy guy

2078
02:45:30,416 --> 02:45:34,749
Hey, this is Virus's pen!
You pinched it?

2079
02:45:35,166 --> 02:45:36,582
Forget it, man

2080
02:45:37,250 --> 02:45:40,957
This is for winners, not losers

2081
02:45:42,041 --> 02:45:49,040
If your school ever needs help,
call my assistant for a donation

2082
02:45:51,166 --> 02:45:53,999
A for Apple, B for Ball...

2083
02:45:55,500 --> 02:45:58,290
He hasn't changed at all!
- Ignore him

2084
02:45:58,416 --> 02:45:59,915
He's full of crap

2085
02:46:00,250 --> 02:46:04,665
Good news is your name
isn't Ranchhoddas Chanchad

2086
02:46:05,041 --> 02:46:09,082
Imagine, after marriage,
I'm Pia Chanchad - Yuck!

2087
02:46:09,833 --> 02:46:11,332
By the way,
what is your real name?

2088
02:46:12,166 --> 02:46:13,082
Phunsukh Wangdu

2089
02:46:13,875 --> 02:46:14,790
Wangdu?

2090
02:46:14,958 --> 02:46:15,832
Pia Wangdu!

2091
02:46:16,500 --> 02:46:18,249
You mean you're a scientist?

2092
02:46:18,458 --> 02:46:19,790
You have 400 patents?

2093
02:46:19,916 --> 02:46:21,790
I won't change my name
after marriage

2094
02:46:21,833 --> 02:46:23,457
You mean you're Chatur's
Wangdu?

2095
02:46:23,541 --> 02:46:25,749
It's you the Japanese are wooing?

2096
02:46:25,791 --> 02:46:26,707
I don't like Wangdu

2097
02:46:27,291 --> 02:46:29,499
Are you a scientist
or a teacher?

2098
02:46:29,916 --> 02:46:31,874
Scientist,
but I also teach children

2099
02:46:31,916 --> 02:46:34,040
So you are
THE Phunsukh Wangdu?

2100
02:46:34,083 --> 02:46:35,249
Yes, yes!

2101
02:46:36,500 --> 02:46:39,415
Hey Silencer
- Hey Chatur, come back

2102
02:46:40,666 --> 02:46:41,790
Take that

2103
02:46:43,333 --> 02:46:45,624
Wait, I'll stop him

2104
02:46:53,500 --> 02:46:57,124
Mr. Wangdu,
I can't believe it's you

2105
02:46:57,625 --> 02:46:58,874
I'm sorry, Mr. Chatur

2106
02:46:58,958 --> 02:47:01,290
I can't sign the deal
with your company

2107
02:47:01,791 --> 02:47:03,832
What sir? Why sir?

2108
02:47:04,041 --> 02:47:06,874
How do I sign, man?
You took my pen

2109
02:47:08,750 --> 02:47:10,749
What pen, sir?
I didn't get you...

2110
02:47:11,083 --> 02:47:15,290
The one in your hand -
Virus's pen

2111
02:47:18,791 --> 02:47:20,290
Mr. Wangdu...?

2112
02:47:20,458 --> 02:47:21,665
Yes, Chatur?

2113
02:47:22,458 --> 02:47:24,457
A for Apple, B for Ball is...

2114
02:47:27,583 --> 02:47:29,249
.... S for Screwed

2115
02:47:36,375 --> 02:47:40,499
You got me, Rancho -
I mean, Mr. Wangdu

2116
02:47:40,875 --> 02:47:42,499
Totally floored me. Good one

2117
02:47:43,166 --> 02:47:47,457
I hope our personal problems
won't affect this deal

2118
02:47:47,625 --> 02:47:50,832
Hey Chatur - take that

2119
02:47:51,458 --> 02:47:53,457
I was just joking, man

2120
02:47:53,833 --> 02:47:57,707
Deep down,
I knew you'd do great things

2121
02:47:58,708 --> 02:48:00,499
You're fibbing

2122
02:48:00,583 --> 02:48:02,540
No, really, I swear

2123
02:48:02,625 --> 02:48:04,624
Rancho - 100, Chatur - 0

2124
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,332
You win, I lose.
You don't believe me?

2125
02:48:08,750 --> 02:48:10,124
Beware of farts

2126
02:48:10,166 --> 02:48:14,457
Your Majesty, thou art great.
Accept this humble offering

2127
02:48:14,541 --> 02:48:16,915
Free advice, Mr. Wangdu -
Run for your life!

2128
02:48:20,625 --> 02:48:24,707
Rancho, I'll lose my job, man.
I have small kids...

2129
02:48:25,666 --> 02:48:28,207
His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas
had correctly stated

2130
02:48:28,416 --> 02:48:33,499
- Follow Excellence... Success
will chase you, pants down
