1
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,583
- You shouldn't do that.

2
00:01:27,686 --> 00:01:29,186
Tap the glass.

3
00:01:31,022 --> 00:01:32,655
- How did you know
I was going to?

4
00:01:34,557 --> 00:01:36,991
- You must forgive my son.
He loves bees.

5
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,926
- It isn't a bee. It's a wasp.

6
00:01:44,097 --> 00:01:45,864
Different thing entirely.

7
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,363
- Was that him?

8
00:03:28,562 --> 00:03:30,896
- Ah, the prodigal returns.

9
00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:37,300
Ooh.

10
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:44,406
- Outside, Roger.
You know you're not allowed.

11
00:03:47,476 --> 00:03:50,143
Like having a Welsh pony.

12
00:03:53,248 --> 00:03:54,947
Will you be going up
to your study?

13
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:56,714
- No, not as yet.

14
00:04:29,877 --> 00:04:32,311
Ah, yes. Home again.

15
00:04:35,448 --> 00:04:36,748
Home again.

16
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:46,356
Mrs. Munro!

17
00:04:49,626 --> 00:04:53,095
It would appear we've had
a decrease in population.

18
00:04:54,864 --> 00:04:57,899
Did Mr. Healy not come by

19
00:04:57,901 --> 00:05:00,234
to take care of the apiary
whilst I was gone?

20
00:05:00,236 --> 00:05:02,469
- Yes, but he won't be able
to do it next time.

21
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:06,539
- Did Mr. Healy say that?
- No, his daughter did.

22
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,041
She's taken him to live
with her. Too feeble, she said.

23
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:13,577
- Is he too feeble?
- Seemed spry enough.

24
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,478
Chattier, maybe.
- With you?

25
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:17,279
- With himself.

26
00:05:18,547 --> 00:05:20,347
- Key to the study.

27
00:05:30,224 --> 00:05:31,957
Is that lunch?
- Mm.

28
00:05:34,226 --> 00:05:36,527
- Hmm...

29
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,905
<i> Watson had married 
 and I was alone. </i>

30
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,474
<i>In fact, it was on the very day 
 he left Baker Street </i>

31
00:07:00,476 --> 00:07:04,578
<i> that the case which was
to be my last began to unfold. </i>

32
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:13,653
<i> It was almost 30 years ago. 
 The Great War had ended </i>

33
00:07:13,655 --> 00:07:15,988
<i> and the tourists 
 had come back to Baker Street </i>

34
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,790
<i> to catch a glimpse 
 of the real Sherlock Holmes. </i>

35
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:22,326
<i> Thankfully, in his stories, </i>

36
00:07:22,328 --> 00:07:24,428
<i> Watson had always published 
 a false address</i>

37
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,729
<i> for our actual quarters. </i>

38
00:07:26,564 --> 00:07:27,997
So you found the right address.

39
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:51,652
Why did you do it?
- Sir?

40
00:07:52,387 --> 00:07:54,254
- Break into my study.

41
00:07:54,256 --> 00:07:57,023
My study is
my sanctum sanctorum.

42
00:07:58,058 --> 00:07:59,457
Private place.

43
00:08:02,427 --> 00:08:06,495
- Before you went to Japan,
I saw you writing that story.

44
00:08:07,296 --> 00:08:09,196
I didn't know you wrote stories.

45
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:11,831
- Oh, Dr. Watson, yes,
he was the writer.

46
00:08:13,266 --> 00:08:15,066
- Well, so I borrowed Mum's key
and went into your study,

47
00:08:15,068 --> 00:08:16,067
and there it was.

48
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:18,436
- And how much did you read?

49
00:08:18,438 --> 00:08:21,272
- Just to where you stopped.
It was a good part too.

50
00:08:21,274 --> 00:08:22,606
A man comes to Baker Street.

51
00:08:22,608 --> 00:08:24,140
You say,
"You've come about your wife."

52
00:08:24,142 --> 00:08:26,876
How could you tell?
Did you do the thing?

53
00:08:27,644 --> 00:08:29,144
- What thing would that be?

54
00:08:30,312 --> 00:08:32,479
- "The cane shows the marks
of a dog's teeth.

55
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:35,147
The wood is from an island
southwest of Madeira."

56
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:36,614
That thing.

57
00:08:37,782 --> 00:08:39,149
- And how would you tell

58
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,451
that a man's visit
was about his wife?

59
00:08:42,152 --> 00:08:43,018
- He wears a wedding ring?

60
00:08:44,086 --> 00:08:47,687
- No.
The clues are all on that page.

61
00:08:48,455 --> 00:08:50,656
This sentence, to be exact.

62
00:08:51,758 --> 00:08:53,825
- "One day, into the room
came a young man,

63
00:08:53,827 --> 00:08:56,960
in newly-pressed,
albeit inexpensive clothes."

64
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,063
The clothes are freshly-pressed.
He's a young man, though.

65
00:09:00,065 --> 00:09:01,998
Not expensive clothes.

66
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,000
Then his wife must press them.
Men don't have the talent

67
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,035
and he can't afford
a servant to do so.

68
00:09:07,736 --> 00:09:09,236
- Very good.

69
00:09:09,238 --> 00:09:10,804
- That's how you knew
it was about the wife.

70
00:09:10,806 --> 00:09:11,871
- Well, no.

71
00:09:13,306 --> 00:09:15,206
When you're a detective
and a man comes to visit you...

72
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:18,041
it's usually about his wife.

73
00:09:20,077 --> 00:09:21,877
- So why did you stop
where you did?

74
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,158
- Ahh...

75
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:49,368
Ah, did you get the things
from the chemist?

76
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,536
- On order.
Said it would be a few days.

77
00:09:51,538 --> 00:09:53,004
- We'll hold them to that.

78
00:09:53,805 --> 00:09:55,539
Otherwise, triumphant, were you?

79
00:09:56,274 --> 00:09:57,874
- Like V-E Day.

80
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:01,010
Oh. Doctor's here.

81
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,785
- Did you catch cold in Japan?
- Does it sound it?

82
00:10:12,354 --> 00:10:13,954
- I thought you might be coming
off the tail end of something.

83
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:17,256
Lost some weight as well.
- Hmm.

84
00:10:18,358 --> 00:10:21,226
- Did you find
what you were looking for,

85
00:10:21,228 --> 00:10:22,794
the mysterious ashy prick?

86
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:25,163
- Prickly ash.

87
00:10:25,165 --> 00:10:26,364
- Oh, yes, sorry.

88
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:30,000
That was the reason the fellow
invited you to Japan, wasn't it?

89
00:10:30,002 --> 00:10:32,369
Dig up a pile of the stuff,
smuggle it home?

90
00:10:32,371 --> 00:10:35,038
- It can't interfere
with anything you've prescribed.

91
00:10:36,407 --> 00:10:39,742
But surely it can't do me ill.
- In and of itself, no.

92
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,243
- You mean there might be
side effects?

93
00:10:42,245 --> 00:10:43,444
- Perhaps.

94
00:10:44,045 --> 00:10:45,879
- Such as?
- Hope.

95
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:58,390
What was the name of the fellow
who invited you to Japan?

96
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,261
You just spent a week
with the man,

97
00:11:04,396 --> 00:11:06,764
corresponded with him
for months.

98
00:11:07,632 --> 00:11:09,032
Do you recall his name?

99
00:11:12,102 --> 00:11:16,104
There's a flat adjacent to
my surgery that's gone to let...

100
00:11:16,106 --> 00:11:17,939
- No!

101
00:11:17,941 --> 00:11:19,640
- What happens when you don't
recall where the telephone is,

102
00:11:19,642 --> 00:11:22,109
or you forget
to turn off the gas?

103
00:11:22,111 --> 00:11:25,278
You can't live alone.
- I don't live alone.

104
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:27,111
I have the housekeeper.

105
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,047
- Take this diary.

106
00:11:33,216 --> 00:11:37,052
Each day you don't recall
a name or place,

107
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,888
make a mark on the page
for that day's date.

108
00:11:41,823 --> 00:11:44,724
- And if I forget
to make the mark?

109
00:12:06,145 --> 00:12:08,212
Oh... Mm.

110
00:12:10,582 --> 00:12:12,482
No, no, no. No. No, no, no.

111
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,650
- It's the royal jelly.

112
00:12:14,652 --> 00:12:16,084
- Yes, well,
we're not using it anymore.

113
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,054
Instead,
we're going to use this.

114
00:12:21,056 --> 00:12:23,824
It's called prickly ash.
- Is it food?

115
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,458
- Mm...

116
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:28,326
- Eurgh. Looks like
it came out the down-spout.

117
00:12:28,328 --> 00:12:29,894
- It came from Japan.

118
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:32,729
- That makes all the difference.

119
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:35,164
- You add it in as you would
the royal jelly,

120
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,731
in the tea or the coffee.

121
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:42,035
And you should try
cooking with it

122
00:12:42,037 --> 00:12:43,770
to enhance your specialities.

123
00:13:43,393 --> 00:13:44,826
- Mr. Holmes?

124
00:13:46,161 --> 00:13:47,494
Mr. Holmes?

125
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:53,365
Tamiki Umezaki.

126
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,534
Welcome to Japan.

127
00:13:58,937 --> 00:14:02,004
I am so honoured
you have accepted my invitation.

128
00:14:03,506 --> 00:14:07,141
We spend tonight at my house.
Tomorrow we begin our search.

129
00:14:41,441 --> 00:14:44,075
I have owned your book
for 20 years.

130
00:14:45,377 --> 00:14:47,611
I purchased my copy
when it first appeared in print.

131
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,748
I hope you'll do me the honour
of a personal inscription.

132
00:14:53,883 --> 00:14:56,384
- Oh, yes. Of course.

133
00:14:59,621 --> 00:15:00,687
Um...

134
00:15:03,824 --> 00:15:06,959
Mr. Umezaki,
how close to the city

135
00:15:06,961 --> 00:15:09,261
does the prickly ash grow?

136
00:15:10,229 --> 00:15:12,029
- It is found
mostly near the sea.

137
00:15:12,031 --> 00:15:13,830
- And how far
shall we have to go?

138
00:15:13,832 --> 00:15:16,732
- Where I am thinking
is two days' journey by train.

139
00:15:20,036 --> 00:15:21,236
You are very eager?

140
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:25,172
- I'm in the middle of a project
that I'm keen to finish

141
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,074
and my wits must be
at their sharpest.

142
00:15:28,842 --> 00:15:29,908
I want to be able to benefit

143
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,376
from the effect
as soon as possible.

144
00:15:32,378 --> 00:15:34,912
- It's that urgent?
- I fear it's so.

145
00:15:36,981 --> 00:15:40,416
- You are very great detective!

146
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:43,384
- Thank you very much.

147
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,658
- My mother, she wonders

148
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,793
if you have brought
your famous hat.

149
00:15:55,494 --> 00:15:57,495
- Oh, the deer stalker.

150
00:15:58,697 --> 00:16:01,732
That was an embellishment
of the illustrator.

151
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:04,834
I've never worn one.

152
00:16:05,869 --> 00:16:08,136
- And the pipe?
- I prefer a cigar.

153
00:16:09,371 --> 00:16:11,939
I told Watson,
if I ever write a story myself,

154
00:16:11,941 --> 00:16:14,841
it will be to correct
the million misconceptions

155
00:16:14,843 --> 00:16:16,909
created by his
imaginative licence.

156
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,110
- Did you write such a story?

157
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:24,680
- But I'm trying to do so now.

158
00:16:44,131 --> 00:16:48,000
I must finish with you
before I die.

159
00:16:59,078 --> 00:17:01,212
"So you've come
about your wife."

160
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,117
<i>"You've come about your wife." </i>

161
00:17:08,585 --> 00:17:09,818
"You've come..."

162
00:17:25,634 --> 00:17:26,734
Roger.

163
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:29,803
Here.

164
00:17:31,172 --> 00:17:32,872
I'll see you after lunch.

165
00:17:34,007 --> 00:17:36,008
I'm going to need some help
with the bees.

166
00:17:47,753 --> 00:17:49,553
So you found the right address.

167
00:17:50,521 --> 00:17:53,022
- A friendly porter at 221B.

168
00:17:54,357 --> 00:17:57,225
- It's just a minor fiction
to mislead the curious.

169
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,828
Most of them
seem to be American.

170
00:18:02,597 --> 00:18:03,930
Have a seat, Mr. Kelmot.

171
00:18:08,835 --> 00:18:09,935
So...

172
00:18:10,803 --> 00:18:12,403
you've come about your wife.

173
00:18:13,505 --> 00:18:15,472
- How did you know?
- It doesn't matter.

174
00:18:15,474 --> 00:18:17,440
Tell me what you have to say.

175
00:18:18,141 --> 00:18:19,441
- My wife is named Ann.

176
00:18:20,776 --> 00:18:23,010
Her mother died in childbirth.

177
00:18:23,678 --> 00:18:25,045
Her father was a colonel,

178
00:18:25,047 --> 00:18:26,746
killed in that business
at Waziristan.

179
00:18:28,048 --> 00:18:29,348
<i> We wanted very much
 to have children. </i>

180
00:18:32,719 --> 00:18:34,953
She lost our first child
in her third month...

181
00:18:37,022 --> 00:18:38,522
<i> Our second in her fourth. </i>

182
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,226
<i> We were told it was
 too dangerous to try again. </i>

183
00:18:44,294 --> 00:18:47,195
<i> Ann was... distraught. </i>

184
00:18:53,134 --> 00:18:54,834
It was as though
each of them lost

185
00:18:54,836 --> 00:18:56,569
had been a real child,
as opposed to...

186
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,939
Thank you.

187
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:06,743
For a time,
she even insisted I have

188
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:07,910
a pair of headstones carved

189
00:19:07,912 --> 00:19:09,645
and placed in our cemetery plot,

190
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:11,146
as if their bodies
were buried beneath.

191
00:19:11,847 --> 00:19:13,480
She was in desperate need

192
00:19:13,482 --> 00:19:15,415
of something to soothe
this dangerous melancholy.

193
00:19:15,417 --> 00:19:18,251
She liked music so I suggested
the glass armonica.

194
00:19:18,253 --> 00:19:19,652
- The armonica?

195
00:19:19,654 --> 00:19:21,453
- My father's
most prized possession.

196
00:19:21,455 --> 00:19:23,154
<i> He played it constantly 
 till the day he died. </i>

197
00:19:24,022 --> 00:19:26,123
<i>I had it brought to the house </i>

198
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,225
<i> and arranged
 a month's worth of lessons. </i>

199
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,659
<i> One hour per week. </i>

200
00:19:30,494 --> 00:19:31,827
Soon Ann asked me
if she could

201
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:33,328
increase the lessons
to twice a week.

202
00:19:34,196 --> 00:19:36,430
Then three times.
Then every day.

203
00:19:37,999 --> 00:19:40,500
<i>- So, she took up the avocation 
 you hoped she would. </i>

204
00:19:41,368 --> 00:19:43,502
Why are you here, Mr. Kelmot?

205
00:19:43,504 --> 00:19:47,038
- Mr. Holmes,
my Ann has changed.

206
00:19:47,939 --> 00:19:49,806
And it isn't just the lessons

207
00:19:49,808 --> 00:19:51,741
or her obsession
with the instrument.

208
00:19:53,477 --> 00:19:55,010
<i>One day I was outside the room </i>

209
00:19:55,012 --> 00:19:56,677
<i> and suddenly
 her playing stopped. </i>

210
00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:01,548
<i> And I heard her saying,
 quite clearly... </i>

211
00:20:02,716 --> 00:20:05,583
- Grace? James?

212
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:10,220
- Those were to be
the names of your children?

213
00:20:11,222 --> 00:20:12,422
- When I confronted Ann,
she denied it.

214
00:20:13,457 --> 00:20:14,523
So I forbad her
playing the armonica

215
00:20:14,525 --> 00:20:16,024
and I forbad her
taking the lessons.

216
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:18,559
The woman who teaches them,
Madame Schirmer,

217
00:20:18,561 --> 00:20:20,227
is a person
of dangerous beliefs.

218
00:20:21,395 --> 00:20:22,795
- The dangerous beliefs
of a music teacher?

219
00:20:22,797 --> 00:20:24,396
- She's put a spell on Ann,

220
00:20:25,398 --> 00:20:26,731
preying upon
her weak frame of mind,

221
00:20:26,733 --> 00:20:27,965
for what reason I cannot say.

222
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:30,033
- Have you proof of this?

223
00:20:30,801 --> 00:20:32,001
- Following my instructions,

224
00:20:32,003 --> 00:20:33,535
she stopped seeing
Madame Schirmer.

225
00:20:33,537 --> 00:20:37,070
I received in the post...
three receipts from the woman.

226
00:20:39,073 --> 00:20:41,374
Each for the payment
of one armonica lesson.

227
00:20:42,142 --> 00:20:43,709
Again Ann denied it.

228
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:46,644
Consequently, my wife
is no longer permitted

229
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:48,278
to withdraw money from the bank.

230
00:20:49,546 --> 00:20:51,313
<i> Then yesterday, I followed Ann</i>

231
00:20:51,315 --> 00:20:53,581
<i> to the place where
 the woman gives her lessons. </i>

232
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,116
<i> Even on the pavement below 
 I could hear her playing. </i>

233
00:20:57,818 --> 00:21:00,152
<i> Naturally, I went inside,
 but the Schirmer woman said, </i>

234
00:21:00,154 --> 00:21:01,720
"Your wife is not here."

235
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:04,722
Last night, I questioned Ann.

236
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:08,925
- And she said that she hadn't
been to Madame Schirmer's rooms.

237
00:21:08,927 --> 00:21:10,059
- Not for weeks.

238
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,897
- Do you have
a portrait of your wife?

239
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,542
I shall take your case if you
answer just one last question.

240
00:21:29,544 --> 00:21:30,676
- Certainly.

241
00:21:31,678 --> 00:21:33,478
- What perfume
does your wife wear?

242
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,913
- Roger?

243
00:21:38,716 --> 00:21:41,084
It's late.
Lights out like it's the Blitz.

244
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,491
Look at you.

245
00:21:52,461 --> 00:21:54,128
Do you remember your dad?

246
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:59,031
- I remember him holding my hand
and taking me to the sea.

247
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:03,934
- You're not remembering.
That's the picture.

248
00:22:06,203 --> 00:22:08,270
What about
the invisible stories?

249
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:11,739
Some nights at bedtime,
your dad would make up stories.

250
00:22:11,741 --> 00:22:14,975
He'd... he'd say,
"Give me three things."

251
00:22:16,077 --> 00:22:19,979
And you'd say,
"A ball, a cat and Roger."

252
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:22,781
So then he'd...

253
00:22:23,482 --> 00:22:25,115
he'd make up some tale

254
00:22:25,117 --> 00:22:28,451
about a ball that had
a pet cat named Roger.

255
00:22:29,821 --> 00:22:31,854
Always a something
and something and Roger.

256
00:22:37,293 --> 00:22:39,460
You don't remember
any of the invisible stories?

257
00:22:40,762 --> 00:22:43,730
- No. Do you?

258
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:49,468
- I was never any good
at stories.

259
00:22:57,143 --> 00:22:58,376
Sleep well.

260
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:06,016
<i> The first thing
 to know is there's no danger. </i>

261
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:08,618
Bees aren't interested
in harming you.

262
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,220
Their only concern
is self-preservation.

263
00:23:11,688 --> 00:23:12,921
- From people?

264
00:23:12,923 --> 00:23:14,489
- They're much too clever
for people.

265
00:23:15,824 --> 00:23:19,593
Their enemies are the weather,
disease and predators.

266
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:22,428
The wasp is their
particular antagonist.

267
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,496
Did you know that one wasp

268
00:23:24,498 --> 00:23:27,665
can kill 40 honey bees
in under a minute?

269
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,101
In consequence,
we do not like wasps.

270
00:23:31,103 --> 00:23:32,302
- Yes, sir.

271
00:23:32,304 --> 00:23:34,070
We do not like wasps.
- Ah.

272
00:23:34,805 --> 00:23:36,906
The queen runs the colony.

273
00:23:38,441 --> 00:23:40,842
The drones service the queen.

274
00:23:41,176 --> 00:23:42,276
Hands up.

275
00:23:44,646 --> 00:23:47,280
Workers do the work.
As it should be.

276
00:23:59,324 --> 00:24:03,727
Of concern is the latest
decrease in the bee population.

277
00:24:05,129 --> 00:24:08,063
We've identified the problem,
and now we must solve it.

278
00:24:09,131 --> 00:24:11,365
Right. There you are.
Off you go.

279
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:13,233
- Have you ever been bitten

280
00:24:13,235 --> 00:24:15,802
by a bee?
- Stung.

281
00:24:15,804 --> 00:24:17,970
Bees don't have teeth.
Yes, I have.

282
00:24:17,972 --> 00:24:19,071
- Well, not often, though.

283
00:24:19,972 --> 00:24:22,306
- 7,816 times.

284
00:24:22,807 --> 00:24:23,907
I keep a record.

285
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,446
You're not entirely dreadful.

286
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:35,581
- You ever been bit?

287
00:24:39,485 --> 00:24:41,718
- No. I have never been bit.

288
00:24:43,821 --> 00:24:47,056
- Well, people work with bees
all the time, don't they?

289
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,267
- What is royal jelly?

290
00:25:00,502 --> 00:25:03,170
- It's a special secretion
of the worker bees.

291
00:25:03,172 --> 00:25:06,406
And it's royal because?
- It feeds the queen.

292
00:25:06,874 --> 00:25:08,074
- Bravo.

293
00:25:09,042 --> 00:25:11,276
It was the jelly's
curative powers

294
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:13,311
that prompted my monograph,

295
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:16,012
The Value of Royal Jelly

296
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:18,314
with Further Comments

297
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:20,916
on the Potential Health Benefits
of Prickly Ash.

298
00:25:21,884 --> 00:25:24,352
- What's that?
- Prickly ash, hmm?

299
00:25:25,287 --> 00:25:27,454
<i>Well, in Japanese, hire sansho </i>

300
00:25:27,456 --> 00:25:31,357
<i>is the common word
for zanthoxylum piperitum. </i>

301
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:35,460
It's used to treat
various degenerative diseases.

302
00:25:35,462 --> 00:25:40,697
Anaemia, circulatory
conditions... arthritis and...

303
00:25:42,633 --> 00:25:44,467
Hmm. What's it called?

304
00:25:44,968 --> 00:25:46,368
Oh. Senility.

305
00:25:48,637 --> 00:25:50,304
That was a witticism.

306
00:25:54,642 --> 00:25:57,744
The newest research suggests
that prickly ash

307
00:25:57,746 --> 00:26:00,880
has far more promise
than royal jelly.

308
00:26:00,882 --> 00:26:03,716
Henceforth, prickly ash
is all that we should use.

309
00:26:03,718 --> 00:26:05,718
- Have you written more
about the man and his wife?

310
00:26:06,686 --> 00:26:09,154
- All in good time.
- Is it real?

311
00:26:10,089 --> 00:26:11,556
- Of course.
Fiction is worthless!

312
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,657
- The place you stopped.

313
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:15,558
Why do you want to know
the wife's perfume?

314
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:22,631
- Cameo Rose, is it?
- Yes.

315
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:34,741
- Always leaves a trace.

316
00:27:57,118 --> 00:27:59,018
Madame Schirmer.

317
00:28:00,253 --> 00:28:01,886
Madame Schirmer, this is
Thomas Kelmot. Let me in.

318
00:28:02,754 --> 00:28:03,987
Madame Schirmer!

319
00:28:05,489 --> 00:28:07,189
<i>- Herr Kelmot, I did warn!</i>

320
00:28:07,191 --> 00:28:09,624
You come,
I call the Metropolitan Police!

321
00:28:09,626 --> 00:28:11,626
- Madame,
my friend's emotional state

322
00:28:11,628 --> 00:28:14,061
is such that, if denied entry,

323
00:28:15,263 --> 00:28:16,763
he might not be able
to restrain his passions.

324
00:28:18,132 --> 00:28:19,966
Allow us both in, and
I will take full responsibility.

325
00:28:19,968 --> 00:28:22,601
Thank you so much.
- Who is this?

326
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:26,837
<i>- This gentleman is a detective.
- Ja? His badge, please?</i>

327
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,638
- His name
is Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

328
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,873
- You don't mind if I close
this, do you? Such a draught.

329
00:28:33,141 --> 00:28:37,777
- No. I have seen Sherlock
Holmes in the magazines.

330
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:40,880
With the hat and the pipe.
It was never this person.

331
00:28:40,882 --> 00:28:43,215
- Madame Schirmer,
I saw Ann enter this place,

332
00:28:43,217 --> 00:28:44,616
I demand you produce her.

333
00:28:45,284 --> 00:28:47,118
- Your wife is not here.

334
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,554
- You said that last time.
- You question my truth?

335
00:28:54,225 --> 00:28:57,193
Oswald, my dear,
it is a wish to know

336
00:28:57,195 --> 00:28:59,195
if you are this man's wife.

337
00:28:59,197 --> 00:29:02,531
- No.
- You could be in disguise.

338
00:29:03,499 --> 00:29:05,132
<i>- I don't think so.
- Voilà! </i>

339
00:29:09,336 --> 00:29:13,538
It is, I believe, what
the English call a water closet.

340
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:16,741
- She was here! I saw her!

341
00:29:16,743 --> 00:29:20,144
- Mr. Kelmot, if you insist
on following your wife

342
00:29:20,146 --> 00:29:21,979
when you have employed me
to do the same,

343
00:29:23,414 --> 00:29:26,382
one or the other of us will
find himself made redundant.

344
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,424
He is distraught.
- He is a fool.

345
00:29:41,095 --> 00:29:43,029
- The armonica
used to be thought of

346
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,064
as an instrument
of the black arts,

347
00:29:46,099 --> 00:29:48,667
said to be used
to call for the dead.

348
00:29:52,004 --> 00:29:55,172
Something to do
with the nature of the glasses.

349
00:29:56,408 --> 00:29:57,840
- You don't believe that,
surely?

350
00:29:59,042 --> 00:30:01,043
- What I believe
plays no part in this matter.

351
00:30:01,045 --> 00:30:03,512
When was Mrs. Kelmot last here?

352
00:30:03,946 --> 00:30:05,513
- Weeks now.

353
00:30:05,515 --> 00:30:08,082
- Then the receipts
you posted to her address

354
00:30:08,084 --> 00:30:09,450
were for Oswald's lessons.

355
00:30:11,085 --> 00:30:13,953
Mrs. Kelmot is paying for them.

356
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:18,923
<i>- Frau Kelmot is passionate,
but an amateur.</i>

357
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:21,758
She knew it was Oswald
who has the gift.

358
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,661
You knew she was not here.
- Of course.

359
00:30:26,462 --> 00:30:27,595
Oswald doesn't wear her scent.

360
00:30:29,864 --> 00:30:32,599
- You are still not
Sherlock Holmes!

361
00:30:49,082 --> 00:30:50,449
- How considerate.

362
00:30:52,051 --> 00:30:53,851
You waited for me.

363
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:20,076
- What are you doing?

364
00:31:21,311 --> 00:31:22,244
- Trying to see
if I can tell where I've been.

365
00:31:22,778 --> 00:31:23,878
- Don't you know?

366
00:31:24,913 --> 00:31:25,779
- Mr. Holmes
can tell things like that

367
00:31:25,781 --> 00:31:27,080
just from looking at a person.

368
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,650
- Where are you off to?
- See to the bees!

369
00:31:31,652 --> 00:31:33,318
- You'll eat
your breakfast first!

370
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:43,026
Got a letter from your aunt
the other day.

371
00:31:44,094 --> 00:31:45,194
She says there's a couple
in Portsmouth

372
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:46,395
opening a hotel there.

373
00:31:46,996 --> 00:31:48,463
Need a housekeeper.

374
00:31:48,465 --> 00:31:50,298
- Why would we want
to live in Portsmouth?

375
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,099
- Can't stay here forever.
- Why not?

376
00:31:52,101 --> 00:31:54,668
- Because we can't.
- What's in Portsmouth?

377
00:31:55,703 --> 00:31:56,335
- This couple are opening
a hotel there...

378
00:31:56,337 --> 00:31:57,436
- You said that.

379
00:31:58,971 --> 00:32:00,371
- You'll leave the table when
you're finished and not before.

380
00:32:00,373 --> 00:32:01,605
- I'm not finished.

381
00:32:08,212 --> 00:32:10,580
- You don't eat
that Japanese muck.

382
00:32:11,281 --> 00:32:12,581
<i>- It's hire sansho. </i>

383
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,853
- I know you like working

384
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,321
with the hive...
- It's an apiary.

385
00:32:21,323 --> 00:32:22,789
- And you like
being given responsibility,

386
00:32:22,791 --> 00:32:24,624
but I shouldn't get too close.

387
00:32:24,626 --> 00:32:27,359
- Bees don't bite.
- I don't mean the bees.

388
00:32:28,627 --> 00:32:30,361
Mr. Holmes
won't be here forever.

389
00:32:31,963 --> 00:32:35,365
Your aunt says this hotel
might even take you on.

390
00:32:36,467 --> 00:32:39,134
They got porters and...
- Have porters.

391
00:32:41,137 --> 00:32:42,303
Finished.

392
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:57,483
<i>- Chemist delivered your things.</i>

393
00:32:57,485 --> 00:32:59,485
Shall I have Roger
open the crate?

394
00:32:59,487 --> 00:33:02,888
- No. I'll see to it
when I'm finished.

395
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,089
- Yes, sir.

396
00:33:07,726 --> 00:33:08,892
Sir?

397
00:33:11,996 --> 00:33:14,464
I know Roger's been
a help to you. He's a good boy.

398
00:33:15,265 --> 00:33:16,698
He's always been clever.

399
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,833
His dad and I
weren't the sort to know

400
00:33:18,835 --> 00:33:20,734
the things a boy like Roger
takes interest in.

401
00:33:21,602 --> 00:33:23,102
- Exceptional children

402
00:33:23,104 --> 00:33:26,405
are often the product
of unremarkable parents.

403
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:32,243
- I've got a sister.
She lives in Portsmouth.

404
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:35,912
A couple of her acquaintants are
opening a private hotel there,

405
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:38,414
say they're willing
to take Roger and me on.

406
00:33:39,015 --> 00:33:40,415
- You have a sister?

407
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,517
Never would have thought it.

408
00:33:45,486 --> 00:33:47,386
Is this a matter of wages?

409
00:33:47,687 --> 00:33:48,887
- No.

410
00:33:54,693 --> 00:33:55,959
- Hmm.

411
00:33:57,127 --> 00:33:59,595
I shall take this
under advisement.

412
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,326
- My mother was sad
to see you leave.

413
00:34:36,728 --> 00:34:40,063
- I'm rather sorry now
I didn't bring the deerstalker.

414
00:34:40,065 --> 00:34:41,864
- You said you never wore one.

415
00:34:41,866 --> 00:34:43,999
- Well, yes,
but it would've pleased her.

416
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:46,234
- She wanted the fictional.
You are the real.

417
00:34:47,202 --> 00:34:48,835
- Well,
I'm not sure that's true.

418
00:34:50,237 --> 00:34:53,572
I think I was real once
until John made me into fiction.

419
00:34:53,574 --> 00:34:55,640
And then after that,
I had little choice.

420
00:34:56,675 --> 00:34:58,442
Play the part
as he'd fashioned it,

421
00:34:58,444 --> 00:35:00,076
or become its contradiction.

422
00:35:01,678 --> 00:35:03,345
I'm actually quite fond
of a pipe,

423
00:35:03,347 --> 00:35:05,747
but to smoke it,
especially in public,

424
00:35:05,749 --> 00:35:11,852
after it became so well known
a prop, seemed vulgar.

425
00:35:11,854 --> 00:35:14,854
- So, Dr. Watson's imagination
changed you?

426
00:35:15,922 --> 00:35:17,822
- I've never had much use
for imagination.

427
00:35:18,957 --> 00:35:21,692
I prefer facts.

428
00:35:44,715 --> 00:35:48,050
- My father
would bring me here as a child.

429
00:35:48,052 --> 00:35:50,352
It was designed as a miniature.

430
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,887
We walk as giants.

431
00:35:57,058 --> 00:36:00,193
The stones represent the lives
of those he has lost.

432
00:36:15,575 --> 00:36:16,841
- Oh...

433
00:36:16,843 --> 00:36:18,042
- Sherlock-san!

434
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,652
<i>- Hire sansho? 
- Prickly ash.</i>

435
00:36:59,047 --> 00:37:00,881
- Mr. Holmes.
- Hmm?

436
00:37:01,682 --> 00:37:02,782
- Too late to check on the bees?

437
00:37:03,483 --> 00:37:04,849
- Not in the least.

438
00:37:07,185 --> 00:37:08,351
- Bee check!

439
00:37:22,163 --> 00:37:23,796
They're quiet.
- Yes.

440
00:37:26,866 --> 00:37:28,600
- What happens
when the bees die?

441
00:37:30,169 --> 00:37:31,868
- Is this
a metaphysical question?

442
00:37:32,636 --> 00:37:33,435
- I mean, do you mourn them?

443
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:37,304
- Oh, I can't say that I've ever
mourned the dead,

444
00:37:37,306 --> 00:37:38,405
bees or otherwise.

445
00:37:38,407 --> 00:37:40,540
I concentrate on circumstances.

446
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:43,409
How did it die?
Who was responsible?

447
00:37:43,411 --> 00:37:46,945
Death, grieving, mourning,

448
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:48,912
they're all commonplace.

449
00:37:48,914 --> 00:37:51,113
Logic is rare, and so...

450
00:37:53,983 --> 00:37:55,483
I dwell on logic.

451
00:37:59,154 --> 00:38:00,954
Well, thank you, kind sir.

452
00:38:02,389 --> 00:38:03,655
Night, bees.

453
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:04,889
- Sweet dreams, bees.

454
00:38:09,694 --> 00:38:12,128
- Now, what do you say
we go for a dip tomorrow?

455
00:38:12,829 --> 00:38:14,396
- In the sea?
- Yes.

456
00:38:14,897 --> 00:38:15,663
- It'll be brisk.

457
00:38:15,665 --> 00:38:16,997
- Good for the blood!

458
00:38:17,865 --> 00:38:19,065
- All right, then.

459
00:38:21,201 --> 00:38:24,169
- What sort of books
do you like, hmm?

460
00:38:25,571 --> 00:38:30,074
Apart from Dr. Watson's stories
and books about bees.

461
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:31,841
- Those are
all the books I have.

462
00:38:33,343 --> 00:38:35,944
- Well, there's a perfectly good
library right here, inside.

463
00:38:36,779 --> 00:38:38,079
You can take any book you like.

464
00:38:59,065 --> 00:39:00,265
- Mr. Holmes?

465
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,500
Are we going for our swim?

466
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,606
I've already seen to the apiary.

467
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:14,509
Are you all right?

468
00:39:15,477 --> 00:39:17,044
- I'm perfectly...

469
00:39:17,912 --> 00:39:19,112
I'm quite...

470
00:39:20,214 --> 00:39:21,347
Perfectly fine.

471
00:39:29,055 --> 00:39:30,889
All right, Roger.

472
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,960
You go along. I'll catch you up.

473
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,975
Roger! Come along
or we'll lose the day.

474
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,020
Well done.

475
00:40:18,496 --> 00:40:19,829
- The photograph is her,
isn't it?

476
00:40:19,831 --> 00:40:21,597
The woman in the story.

477
00:40:22,966 --> 00:40:24,099
- Yes.

478
00:40:25,301 --> 00:40:26,534
- Is she why you're writing it?

479
00:40:27,502 --> 00:40:29,202
- I wouldn't say
I was writing it...

480
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,537
It's more I'm trying
to remember it.

481
00:40:32,939 --> 00:40:34,406
Ah, thank you.

482
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:39,176
A few months ago,
my brother Mycroft died.

483
00:40:40,778 --> 00:40:43,079
<i> His club, the Diogenes, </i>

484
00:40:44,614 --> 00:40:47,382
<i> asked that I go up to London 
 to retrieve his things. </i>

485
00:40:52,821 --> 00:40:57,924
<i> I was given a small chest 
containing the Watson stories, </i>

486
00:40:59,192 --> 00:41:01,092
<i> none of which
 I'd ever actually read. </i>

487
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:06,029
<i> They were as John
 always described them, </i>

488
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:09,565
<i> penny dreadfuls
 with an elevated prose style. </i>

489
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:13,135
<i> But one of the titles
 piqued my interest. </i>

490
00:41:14,103 --> 00:41:15,670
<i> The story was familiar, </i>

491
00:41:15,672 --> 00:41:17,904
<i> but its ending felt very,
 very wrong. </i>

492
00:41:20,507 --> 00:41:23,742
<i> I'd not seen any of
 the cinematic depictions. </i>

493
00:41:23,744 --> 00:41:27,011
<i> But by a fortunate chance, 
 an opportunity soon arose. </i>

494
00:41:28,747 --> 00:41:32,315
<i>It's strange to see a semblance
 of one's self 40 feet high... </i>

495
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,584
<i>- I fear for my Ann's sanity. 
- Fear for her sanity? </i>

496
00:41:37,752 --> 00:41:39,652
<i> Dear man,
you should fear for your life. </i>

497
00:41:41,021 --> 00:41:42,154
<i>- Whatever do you mean? </i>

498
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:47,925
<i>- Murder, Mr. Kelmot. Murder. </i>

499
00:41:48,826 --> 00:41:50,092
<i> ...and played </i>

500
00:41:50,094 --> 00:41:51,259
<i> as a character
 out of pantomime. </i>

501
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:53,427
<i>-  Poisoned? </i>

502
00:41:53,429 --> 00:41:55,162
<i> With what means have I? </i>

503
00:41:55,164 --> 00:41:57,464
<i>- Your armonica,
 Madame Schirmer. </i>

504
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:02,301
<i>- Preposterous! 
- Or rather, the glasses. </i>

505
00:42:02,303 --> 00:42:05,336
<i> It is the lead in the crystal
 that creates the unique tone. </i>

506
00:42:06,705 --> 00:42:08,439
<i> Absorbed into the blood
 through the skin, </i>

507
00:42:08,441 --> 00:42:11,441
<i> small exposure can produce
 confusion, hallucinations. </i>

508
00:42:12,976 --> 00:42:18,013
<i>But constant, obsessive contact 
can end in insanity and death. </i>

509
00:42:19,482 --> 00:42:20,281
<i> Every plot twist
 came with a twirl</i>

510
00:42:20,283 --> 00:42:21,649
<i> of a moustache </i>

511
00:42:21,651 --> 00:42:23,384
<i> and ended
 in an exclamation mark. </i>

512
00:42:25,954 --> 00:42:28,422
<i> Our
would-be murderer is ingenious. </i>

513
00:42:29,624 --> 00:42:31,324
<i>- Surely you're not
 referring to... </i>

514
00:42:31,326 --> 00:42:33,225
<i>- I'm afraid, Mrs. Kelmot,
 you will have to find yourself</i>

515
00:42:33,227 --> 00:42:34,292
<i> a new music teacher. </i>

516
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:40,196
<i>- Oh. </i>

517
00:42:57,847 --> 00:42:59,581
<i> Absolute rubbish! </i>

518
00:43:00,382 --> 00:43:01,982
What possible motive

519
00:43:01,984 --> 00:43:04,584
could that German woman
have had to kill Ann?

520
00:43:06,053 --> 00:43:08,487
That night
I searched for something

521
00:43:08,489 --> 00:43:11,389
to jog my memory
of the actual case.

522
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:18,895
<i> And there it was...
 Her picture. </i>

523
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:23,532
You know, a few years ago,
I could have told you everything

524
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,166
about the woman
in that photograph.

525
00:43:26,368 --> 00:43:28,268
Certainly I'd recall
what had become of her,

526
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:30,603
whether she was victim
or culprit.

527
00:43:31,371 --> 00:43:32,604
But that night...

528
00:43:35,541 --> 00:43:37,141
I couldn't remember any of it.

529
00:43:38,877 --> 00:43:41,712
All I knew for certain
was that the case was my last

530
00:43:41,714 --> 00:43:44,181
and it was why
I left the profession,

531
00:43:44,715 --> 00:43:45,648
came down here,

532
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:48,083
retired to my bees.

533
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:54,154
So, I decided to
write the story down on paper

534
00:43:55,022 --> 00:43:58,857
as it was, not as John made it.

535
00:43:59,592 --> 00:44:01,192
Get it right before I die.

536
00:44:02,227 --> 00:44:03,694
- You're not going to die.

537
00:44:03,696 --> 00:44:04,761
- Roger.

538
00:44:06,263 --> 00:44:07,429
I'm 93.

539
00:44:08,564 --> 00:44:10,464
- I had a great uncle
who lived to be 102.

540
00:44:11,432 --> 00:44:12,765
- Well, then,
that seals my fate.

541
00:44:13,733 --> 00:44:15,133
What are the odds
that you would know

542
00:44:15,135 --> 00:44:16,767
two men who would live
that long?

543
00:44:17,702 --> 00:44:20,469
- Well, I didn't
actually know him.

544
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:30,943
I'll see to the bees.

545
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:38,249
Ow! Mr. Holmes!

546
00:44:38,251 --> 00:44:39,350
- Mr. Holmes!

547
00:44:40,151 --> 00:44:41,451
- Aargh. Aargh.

548
00:44:42,653 --> 00:44:44,286
I've been stung.

549
00:44:45,554 --> 00:44:48,722
- Unlike the wasp,
the bee always leaves its sting.

550
00:44:49,724 --> 00:44:51,124
- I must have done

551
00:44:51,126 --> 00:44:52,558
something stupid.
- Oh, no.

552
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,861
Sometimes...
there's no reason at all.

553
00:44:57,829 --> 00:45:00,964
Right.
Salt water, you drink that.

554
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:06,000
Or onion juice
to prevent serious consequences.

555
00:45:07,268 --> 00:45:10,637
And no need to tell your mother
about all this.

556
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:12,338
We don't want to worry her,
do we?

557
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,673
- You going to go back
to the story?

558
00:45:15,808 --> 00:45:17,508
- Is that the price
for your silence?

559
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:19,042
- Tight lips.

560
00:46:10,623 --> 00:46:14,058
- How considerate.
You waited for me.

561
00:46:38,383 --> 00:46:39,483
Good afternoon.

562
00:46:40,485 --> 00:46:42,185
- Sir?
- Tea for one in the window.

563
00:46:42,187 --> 00:46:43,619
- Certainly, sir. Mind the step.

564
00:46:58,868 --> 00:47:00,702
- Ill, do you say?

565
00:47:00,704 --> 00:47:02,770
- Took all the strength he had
just to write out the cheque.

566
00:47:25,226 --> 00:47:26,593
- There you are, sir.
- Thank you.

567
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:29,594
Well, here we are.

568
00:47:32,197 --> 00:47:34,565
- Have you used this before?
- No. I haven't.

569
00:47:34,567 --> 00:47:39,269
It is highly poisonous.
A drop will more than suffice.

570
00:47:39,271 --> 00:47:40,370
- Thank you.

571
00:47:59,421 --> 00:48:01,455
It's just Thomas
is in such a state.

572
00:48:01,457 --> 00:48:03,423
He insisted I made certain.

573
00:48:03,425 --> 00:48:05,124
- Reassure Mr. Kelmot

574
00:48:06,292 --> 00:48:07,792
that the particulars of the will
have not changed

575
00:48:07,794 --> 00:48:08,959
since he dictated them.

576
00:48:10,394 --> 00:48:12,228
Your possessions are bequeathed
to him, as his are to you.

577
00:48:23,739 --> 00:48:27,207
Thank you so much.
It was so good to see you.

578
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:31,110
- Excuse me.
- Yes, miss?

579
00:48:31,112 --> 00:48:32,744
Is the 8:10 the fast service?

580
00:48:32,746 --> 00:48:34,846
- The 8:10's the slow one,
makes local stops.

581
00:48:35,647 --> 00:48:36,880
And the 9:05?

582
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:39,415
- That's the fast train,
goes right on through.

583
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,216
- All aboard!
- Thank you.

584
00:48:41,785 --> 00:48:43,252
- All aboard.

585
00:49:58,692 --> 00:50:00,492
- Honeybees
are attracted to you.

586
00:50:02,761 --> 00:50:05,162
It's the scent. Cameo Rose.

587
00:50:06,164 --> 00:50:08,431
- Oh.
- She thinks you're a flower.

588
00:50:11,134 --> 00:50:12,834
Must confuse
the little thing no end.

589
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:16,270
May I?

590
00:50:17,538 --> 00:50:18,671
- Oh.

591
00:50:20,173 --> 00:50:21,273
- Very kind.

592
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:27,044
Ah. The iris.
Amazing resilience.

593
00:50:27,879 --> 00:50:29,446
Enough light and they will grow

594
00:50:29,448 --> 00:50:30,847
in the most
uninhabitable regions,

595
00:50:30,849 --> 00:50:33,448
desert, cold, rock.

596
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:36,617
Why do you suppose it is

597
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:38,385
that something as small
and insignificant as the iris

598
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,454
should be so much stronger
than we are?

599
00:50:42,989 --> 00:50:45,123
- Perhaps they're less affected
by what goes on around them.

600
00:50:46,191 --> 00:50:47,291
- Hmm.

601
00:50:48,326 --> 00:50:51,427
Are you a botanist?
- Amateur only.

602
00:50:52,395 --> 00:50:54,362
I am, by disposition,
a hobbyist.

603
00:50:55,497 --> 00:50:58,632
In fact, if I may,
there is one particular

604
00:50:58,634 --> 00:51:01,534
hobby of mine
that might amuse you.

605
00:51:04,838 --> 00:51:06,205
I can see the future.

606
00:51:10,242 --> 00:51:12,243
Shall I read your palm?

607
00:51:12,245 --> 00:51:14,712
I promise
I'll find nothing dreadful.

608
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,453
- What about our friend?

609
00:51:34,097 --> 00:51:35,230
Oh.

610
00:51:39,334 --> 00:51:40,400
Oh.

611
00:51:48,875 --> 00:51:50,909
- Hmm. Hmm.

612
00:51:57,049 --> 00:51:58,416
Your parents are gone.

613
00:52:00,118 --> 00:52:04,287
Your mother long ago,
your father more recently.

614
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:07,089
You had love in your heart
for someone...

615
00:52:08,524 --> 00:52:11,926
No, for more than one person.

616
00:52:13,028 --> 00:52:15,062
But they have left you,

617
00:52:15,064 --> 00:52:18,831
and your love for them
has nowhere to go.

618
00:52:20,133 --> 00:52:21,299
You're in pain.

619
00:52:22,634 --> 00:52:24,935
But you must not allow your pain
to guide your actions.

620
00:52:26,237 --> 00:52:30,539
Where that leads...
The lines are not so distinct.

621
00:52:31,307 --> 00:52:33,141
- Why?
- I beg your pardon?

622
00:52:33,709 --> 00:52:34,775
- You see so much.

623
00:52:36,711 --> 00:52:38,144
Why can't you see
what happens next?

624
00:52:39,546 --> 00:52:41,280
- The lines...
- Yes, you said.

625
00:52:47,553 --> 00:52:50,154
Ply your parlour tricks
elsewhere, Mr. Holmes.

626
00:52:56,327 --> 00:52:57,460
- Wait.

627
00:53:06,836 --> 00:53:07,969
I can't...

628
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:13,673
I can't remember.

629
00:54:06,223 --> 00:54:08,390
- Mum! Mum!

630
00:54:16,164 --> 00:54:17,430
- Mr. Holmes!

631
00:54:31,342 --> 00:54:32,675
Was it the smoke
knocked him out?

632
00:54:32,677 --> 00:54:33,909
- Could have done.

633
00:54:34,877 --> 00:54:36,210
Most likely he stood up
too quickly

634
00:54:36,212 --> 00:54:37,211
and lost consciousness.

635
00:54:37,845 --> 00:54:38,878
It isn't the first time.

636
00:54:40,013 --> 00:54:41,613
The last housekeeper
didn't know what to do.

637
00:54:46,685 --> 00:54:49,453
He must have decided
to take it subcutaneously.

638
00:55:29,927 --> 00:55:31,260
- Well, now we can't leave.

639
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:34,463
- No.
Made sure of that, didn't he?

640
00:55:50,777 --> 00:55:52,143
<i>- Where's the hire sansho? </i>

641
00:55:54,279 --> 00:55:55,746
The prickly ash.

642
00:55:55,748 --> 00:55:57,347
- If it's not there,
I'm sure I don't know.

643
00:55:58,582 --> 00:56:01,150
- Did you throw it out?
- Why would I do that?

644
00:56:01,918 --> 00:56:03,051
- For spite and malice.

645
00:56:06,422 --> 00:56:07,989
- Where'd you get words
like that?

646
00:56:07,991 --> 00:56:09,724
- The dictionary.

647
00:56:10,792 --> 00:56:12,225
- Like as not,
he took the muck himself.

648
00:56:12,227 --> 00:56:13,926
Got burnt up
with the rest of it.

649
00:56:13,928 --> 00:56:15,060
Those can go on the fire.

650
00:56:16,128 --> 00:56:17,528
- Did Mr. Holmes say
you were to do this?

651
00:56:19,063 --> 00:56:20,797
- He always disposes
of that sort.

652
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,732
- How do you know
what sort these are?

653
00:56:22,734 --> 00:56:24,400
- You want to know
who writes to him?

654
00:56:24,402 --> 00:56:26,635
Pensioners who think
they've solved Jack the Ripper.

655
00:56:27,436 --> 00:56:29,003
Widows who've lost their cats

656
00:56:29,005 --> 00:56:30,804
and just know he's the only
man on Earth who can find them.

657
00:56:32,072 --> 00:56:33,405
He's the last resort
for every lunatic out there.

658
00:56:34,407 --> 00:56:35,140
- It's not your decision.
- It is...

659
00:56:36,475 --> 00:56:38,142
If I'm to be a full-bore
medical staff at cook's wages.

660
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:41,612
He's an invalid. Needs a nurse,
not a housekeeper.

661
00:56:41,614 --> 00:56:43,146
- All he did was took a fall.

662
00:56:43,148 --> 00:56:44,447
- Your granddad
was hale and hearty

663
00:56:44,449 --> 00:56:46,015
60 summers
then he took a fall.

664
00:56:46,017 --> 00:56:47,816
It was three weeks
to the day he died.

665
00:56:49,118 --> 00:56:50,985
Should be in hospital.
That or one of them places.

666
00:56:51,586 --> 00:56:53,286
- He'll get better!

667
00:56:53,288 --> 00:56:55,388
- And the day he does
is the day we go.

668
00:56:55,856 --> 00:56:56,722
Is that clear?

669
00:57:17,874 --> 00:57:19,174
- Hmm.

670
00:57:20,943 --> 00:57:22,877
Oh.
- Got a letter from Japan.

671
00:57:24,012 --> 00:57:25,512
It's from Mr. Umezaki.

672
00:57:27,615 --> 00:57:30,583
- Have you read it?
- No. Wanted to.

673
00:57:31,518 --> 00:57:33,852
- Sin of desire.
You're a Catholic.

674
00:57:46,365 --> 00:57:48,499
- Mum says you throw out
most of the letters you get.

675
00:57:48,501 --> 00:57:50,000
- And why do you think that is?

676
00:57:50,002 --> 00:57:52,035
- The people who write
want you to solve things.

677
00:57:53,237 --> 00:57:54,403
If you read their letters,
you'd want to help.

678
00:57:54,405 --> 00:57:57,272
- Oh, no.
You give me too much credit.

679
00:57:58,207 --> 00:57:59,841
It's just
if I were to read them,

680
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:01,742
I'd feel obliged to respond.

681
00:58:03,277 --> 00:58:06,078
- Perhaps Mr. Umezaki's
asking you to go back to Japan.

682
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:10,715
- Oh.
I'll never go back to Japan.

683
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:14,051
- Why not?
- Long journey, old man.

684
00:58:15,253 --> 00:58:17,887
- You made it before.
- That was before.

685
00:58:21,691 --> 00:58:23,658
- Maybe you could get
more prickly ash.

686
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:25,792
- The prickly ash hasn't made

687
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:28,127
a bit of difference
to my memory,

688
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:29,995
any more
than the royal jelly did.

689
00:58:30,763 --> 00:58:31,863
Yes.

690
00:58:33,198 --> 00:58:34,765
The only inspiration

691
00:58:34,767 --> 00:58:36,733
for any sort of recollections
has been you.

692
00:58:39,970 --> 00:58:41,503
Go on. You open it.

693
00:58:42,605 --> 00:58:44,439
He's writing to say
his mother is dead.

694
00:58:50,045 --> 00:58:51,645
- How could you tell?

695
00:58:51,647 --> 00:58:54,214
- Mr. Umezaki swore that
he would never contact me again.

696
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:57,316
The only thing that would
make him change his mind

697
00:58:57,318 --> 00:58:59,918
would be a deathbed instruction
from his mother.

698
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,355
A good son always does
what his mother asks.

699
00:59:08,192 --> 00:59:09,525
- Mr. Holmes!

700
00:59:10,994 --> 00:59:12,728
You're not to be out of bed!

701
00:59:13,963 --> 00:59:16,064
- Mrs. Munro,
I have counted the steps

702
00:59:16,066 --> 00:59:19,400
from the bed to the window,
from the window to the...

703
00:59:19,402 --> 00:59:21,869
- You're not to do anything
on your own.

704
00:59:21,871 --> 00:59:22,970
You're to ring.

705
00:59:24,872 --> 00:59:26,472
- I thought it was
an imposition.

706
00:59:26,474 --> 00:59:28,240
- It will be an imposition
if you lose your bearings

707
00:59:28,242 --> 00:59:30,208
and end up on the floor
for me to collect!

708
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:33,077
- I hadn't realised
that this had become

709
00:59:33,079 --> 00:59:34,377
an industrial dispute.

710
01:00:05,674 --> 01:00:08,075
I've been trying
to calculate the likelihood

711
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:11,211
<i>that we should find hire sansho </i>

712
01:00:11,213 --> 01:00:13,680
in a place
so utterly devoid of life.

713
01:00:13,682 --> 01:00:16,249
- Perhaps it is life
reasserting itself.

714
01:00:20,587 --> 01:00:21,787
<i> Hire sansho. </i>

715
01:00:31,463 --> 01:00:32,863
- How does it taste?

716
01:00:35,066 --> 01:00:37,300
- It isn't for the taste
that we sought it.

717
01:00:50,744 --> 01:00:52,578
Ah, now, before we leave,

718
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:55,314
there's something
that I mustn't forget.

719
01:00:56,649 --> 01:00:59,783
I've signed it,
as you requested.

720
01:01:00,084 --> 01:01:01,217
- Oh.

721
01:01:02,452 --> 01:01:06,120
- Not certain
you can read my scrawl.

722
01:01:08,089 --> 01:01:12,792
- "To Mr. Umezaki, who has not
owned this book for long."

723
01:01:13,927 --> 01:01:15,794
- You haven't had this book
for 20 years.

724
01:01:15,796 --> 01:01:17,295
It came from the library.

725
01:01:18,330 --> 01:01:20,264
The glue mark shows
where you removed

726
01:01:20,266 --> 01:01:21,331
the card jacket.

727
01:01:22,766 --> 01:01:26,467
You know nothing about bees
or royal jelly or prickly ash.

728
01:01:27,235 --> 01:01:28,635
- Enough to bring you here.

729
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:32,638
During our correspondence
over the last few months...

730
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:35,807
was my name not familiar to you?

731
01:01:35,809 --> 01:01:38,142
- No.
- My father's, then?

732
01:01:38,843 --> 01:01:40,310
Masuo Umezaki?

733
01:01:41,078 --> 01:01:42,445
- I never knew your father.

734
01:01:42,447 --> 01:01:44,547
- He was a diplomat in London,
years ago.

735
01:01:45,916 --> 01:01:47,983
He loved all things English.

736
01:01:49,685 --> 01:01:52,486
The first gift he gave to me
was a cricket bat.

737
01:01:54,255 --> 01:01:56,089
The second was this.

738
01:01:57,458 --> 01:02:02,161
In English,
so as to "assist my education."

739
01:02:16,041 --> 01:02:17,641
- "After consulting

740
01:02:17,643 --> 01:02:19,843
"with the very great
detective Sherlock Holmes,

741
01:02:21,111 --> 01:02:23,645
"I realise it's in the best
interests of us all

742
01:02:23,647 --> 01:02:26,180
"that I remain
in England indefinitely.

743
01:02:26,948 --> 01:02:28,715
"You will see from this book

744
01:02:28,717 --> 01:02:31,617
"that he is a very wise
and intelligent man,

745
01:02:31,619 --> 01:02:34,886
and that his say in this matter
should not be taken lightly."

746
01:02:35,954 --> 01:02:37,788
- We never heard from him again.

747
01:02:38,723 --> 01:02:41,124
- I'm sorry.
- My mother is dying.

748
01:02:42,493 --> 01:02:45,694
She grew old without a husband.
All because of you.

749
01:02:53,135 --> 01:02:54,235
- I understand.

750
01:02:55,337 --> 01:02:57,137
The last time
you heard from your father

751
01:02:57,139 --> 01:02:59,405
was the first time
you heard about me.

752
01:03:00,306 --> 01:03:03,007
Masuo vanished from your life

753
01:03:03,009 --> 01:03:06,209
and I arrived...
in the form of a book.

754
01:03:07,211 --> 01:03:08,911
One replaced the other,
as it were.

755
01:03:11,014 --> 01:03:13,181
I suggest you and your mother
take whatever time you have

756
01:03:13,183 --> 01:03:15,716
to come to terms
with the facts of the case.

757
01:03:17,051 --> 01:03:19,952
A man abandoned his family
and wrote his son a story.

758
01:03:21,321 --> 01:03:22,854
He wouldn't be the first

759
01:03:22,856 --> 01:03:25,256
to cloak his cowardice
in a flag of sacrifice.

760
01:03:29,493 --> 01:03:29,992
I'm sorry.

761
01:03:33,596 --> 01:03:35,396
But I never knew your father.

762
01:03:42,837 --> 01:03:45,738
- I shall not bother you
any longer with my questions.

763
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:51,009
But if the prickly ash succeeds,
you will let me know?

764
01:04:19,571 --> 01:04:20,871
- Aargh, argh!

765
01:04:20,873 --> 01:04:22,539
Aargh!

766
01:04:25,943 --> 01:04:28,311
Help.

767
01:04:28,612 --> 01:04:29,612
Help.

768
01:04:37,253 --> 01:04:38,386
Thank you.

769
01:04:39,221 --> 01:04:41,222
I look like I've been attacked

770
01:04:41,224 --> 01:04:43,323
by the Hound
of the Baskervilles.

771
01:04:45,159 --> 01:04:46,392
- Can't let Mum

772
01:04:46,394 --> 01:04:48,460
see you wearing that top.
- No.

773
01:04:48,462 --> 01:04:50,495
- It's evidence.
- Yes.

774
01:04:51,063 --> 01:04:53,264
What of? A murder?

775
01:04:56,734 --> 01:04:59,569
Oh... I've something for you.

776
01:05:03,239 --> 01:05:04,339
No.

777
01:05:07,409 --> 01:05:09,843
<i> Apis cerana japonica. </i>

778
01:05:11,478 --> 01:05:14,413
- They have bees in Japan?
- Yes. Just like our bees.

779
01:05:14,415 --> 01:05:15,814
Only they're Japanese.

780
01:05:17,249 --> 01:05:18,983
No, it's for you. It's a gift.

781
01:05:19,951 --> 01:05:22,252
- Oh. Thank you.

782
01:05:22,254 --> 01:05:24,420
<i>- Arigato, as they say in Japan.</i>

783
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:31,025
Something the matter?

784
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:35,963
- You lost
another dozen bees today.

785
01:05:36,965 --> 01:05:38,932
- A dozen?
- What do you think it is?

786
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:41,267
- An outbreak of mortality.

787
01:05:42,369 --> 01:05:45,571
Could be a disease
we've not seen before,

788
01:05:45,573 --> 01:05:47,339
or a sudden mutation.

789
01:05:48,607 --> 01:05:50,708
You bring up some corpses
and we'll examine them.

790
01:05:51,576 --> 01:05:54,210
- Yes, sir!
- And my glass.

791
01:05:55,245 --> 01:05:56,511
Study.
Should be in one of the drawers.

792
01:06:41,489 --> 01:06:42,589
Roger?

793
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:57,570
Roger?

794
01:07:06,946 --> 01:07:10,614
- Mr. Holmes feels better today.
- Is that so?

795
01:07:11,115 --> 01:07:12,215
- Hmm.

796
01:07:13,183 --> 01:07:15,117
- Mr. Holmes
feels so much better,

797
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:17,185
we're about to start
an investigation.

798
01:07:18,854 --> 01:07:20,054
- Of what?

799
01:07:20,056 --> 01:07:22,189
- The crime wave
that has done away

800
01:07:22,191 --> 01:07:25,191
with a number of our apiary's
most prominent residents.

801
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:30,094
- Well. If you need suspects,
you know where to find me.

802
01:07:30,528 --> 01:07:32,095
- Mum, wait.

803
01:07:33,464 --> 01:07:36,131
I bet if we asked, Mr. Holmes
would... do his thing.

804
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,400
The thing he does
where he tells people

805
01:07:39,402 --> 01:07:41,301
who they are and where
they've been, just from looking.

806
01:07:43,304 --> 01:07:44,504
Do Mum for her.

807
01:07:44,506 --> 01:07:45,905
- I'm sure your mother

808
01:07:45,907 --> 01:07:48,207
doesn't need to be told
where she's been.

809
01:07:49,509 --> 01:07:51,042
- Let's not bother Mr. Holmes
with any foolishness.

810
01:07:51,044 --> 01:07:52,910
- It's not foolishness. Here.

811
01:07:54,479 --> 01:07:57,547
You come and stand in front
of Mr. Holmes. Just like that.

812
01:07:58,582 --> 01:08:00,115
And he will tell you
where you've been.

813
01:08:02,485 --> 01:08:03,585
Do it.

814
01:08:05,554 --> 01:08:07,388
You want her
to turn in a circle?

815
01:08:07,390 --> 01:08:09,123
- No, that won't be necessary.

816
01:08:09,924 --> 01:08:11,057
- Turn in a circle.

817
01:08:35,114 --> 01:08:36,581
- You've been away
most of the day.

818
01:08:37,382 --> 01:08:38,782
The soot on your dress attests

819
01:08:38,784 --> 01:08:41,117
that you went by train
to Portsmouth,

820
01:08:42,519 --> 01:08:44,586
as all other nearby rail lines
which might accommodate

821
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:49,423
a return trip of this length
are under repair or beyond it.

822
01:08:50,758 --> 01:08:53,126
In Portsmouth, you met
the couple who run the hotel.

823
01:08:54,528 --> 01:08:56,395
Your hair and nails are evidence
that you wished to make

824
01:08:56,397 --> 01:08:57,963
a favourable impression.

825
01:08:59,031 --> 01:09:00,097
They made you an offer,
you accepted.

826
01:09:01,232 --> 01:09:02,832
You declined tea,
and did not see the sister

827
01:09:03,934 --> 01:09:05,301
for whom you have
no particular fondness,

828
01:09:05,303 --> 01:09:10,472
using my indisposition
as an excuse to hurry back.

829
01:09:11,774 --> 01:09:14,342
- It wasn't an excuse.
- You accepted?

830
01:09:17,479 --> 01:09:18,612
- Start a week Monday.

831
01:09:19,981 --> 01:09:21,114
- Both of us?

832
01:09:22,082 --> 01:09:23,082
- We're both going.
- She wants me

833
01:09:23,084 --> 01:09:24,049
to be a bootblack!

834
01:09:24,550 --> 01:09:25,816
- Roger!

835
01:09:25,818 --> 01:09:27,484
- She wants me
to do what she does!

836
01:09:28,452 --> 01:09:29,785
- There is no shame
in what I do!

837
01:09:29,787 --> 01:09:31,453
- You complain enough about it!
Always going on

838
01:09:31,455 --> 01:09:33,755
about how hard things are.
And you wish you had it better!

839
01:09:33,757 --> 01:09:35,757
She can barely read!

840
01:09:45,433 --> 01:09:46,566
- Go after her.

841
01:09:47,901 --> 01:09:50,302
Apologise for saying things
that were meant to hurt.

842
01:09:51,170 --> 01:09:52,503
You were cruel!

843
01:09:53,671 --> 01:09:56,672
If you don't apologise,
you will regret it.

844
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,574
- People always say that.
- Because it's true.

845
01:09:59,576 --> 01:10:01,943
<i> Moi, je regrette tellement. </i>

846
01:10:01,945 --> 01:10:05,146
- You regret...
- So much!

847
01:10:27,101 --> 01:10:29,102
- Your dad hated
what he did for a living.

848
01:10:30,304 --> 01:10:32,538
Mechanic in a garage,
like his dad before him.

849
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:35,774
When he got called up,
he said to me,

850
01:10:35,776 --> 01:10:37,442
"My love,
I'll not spend this war

851
01:10:37,444 --> 01:10:39,610
"underneath the oil pan
of some toff's jeep.

852
01:10:40,645 --> 01:10:42,512
I'm gonna put in for the RAF."

853
01:10:44,014 --> 01:10:45,114
So he did.

854
01:10:46,683 --> 01:10:47,783
He trained.

855
01:10:49,385 --> 01:10:53,521
Scored high marks, got assigned
to a Bristol Blenheim, Mark IV.

856
01:10:54,523 --> 01:10:58,225
Blown out of the sky.
First time up.

857
01:11:01,529 --> 01:11:03,630
All his mates
who worked the motor pool

858
01:11:03,632 --> 01:11:05,031
came home without a scratch.

859
01:11:07,334 --> 01:11:09,100
- I shouldn't have said
what I said.

860
01:11:11,336 --> 01:11:12,536
- Lesson there, then.

861
01:11:14,071 --> 01:11:15,471
Don't say everything you think.

862
01:11:31,318 --> 01:11:32,418
- Look.

863
01:11:38,891 --> 01:11:41,458
- How did you find that?
- In your desk.

864
01:11:43,994 --> 01:11:46,562
- Couldn't have.
- The one in the corner.

865
01:11:47,697 --> 01:11:49,197
Didn't know it was a desk
until I opened it.

866
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:52,166
- Oh, that's not my desk,
it's John's.

867
01:11:52,168 --> 01:11:55,434
He left it at Baker Street
when he went off to get married.

868
01:11:56,569 --> 01:11:58,403
- Yes, and there's
a secret compartment

869
01:11:58,405 --> 01:12:00,271
containing the very glove
you've been writing about.

870
01:12:02,007 --> 01:12:03,540
I know you say Dr. Watson
didn't always

871
01:12:03,542 --> 01:12:05,008
get things right,
but in the story...

872
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:07,010
- I am not working
on that story anymore.

873
01:12:07,012 --> 01:12:10,079
- Yes, but in Watson's story,
he does have the armonica in it.

874
01:12:10,081 --> 01:12:12,014
And the German lady.
And that glove.

875
01:12:12,882 --> 01:12:13,681
So maybe
he did get things right.

876
01:12:13,683 --> 01:12:15,382
- No, that's not possible.

877
01:12:15,384 --> 01:12:17,117
John had gone
from Baker Street by then.

878
01:12:17,119 --> 01:12:18,685
- Well, then why was it
in there?

879
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:19,919
- I don't know!

880
01:12:21,021 --> 01:12:22,755
And if I ever did know,
I don't remember.

881
01:12:23,389 --> 01:12:24,689
- If you can't remember,

882
01:12:24,691 --> 01:12:26,123
then why couldn't the case
have been a success

883
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:28,859
like Dr. Watson wrote it?
- Because it was my last case.

884
01:12:28,861 --> 01:12:31,228
And if I'd brought it
to a successful conclusion,

885
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:33,096
I wouldn't have left
the profession

886
01:12:33,098 --> 01:12:37,467
and spent 35 years here, in
this place, away from the world!

887
01:12:43,273 --> 01:12:46,708
I chose exile for my punishment,
but what was it for?

888
01:12:47,876 --> 01:12:49,776
I must have done something
terribly wrong...

889
01:12:50,878 --> 01:12:53,045
And I've no evidence
of what it was.

890
01:12:53,646 --> 01:12:56,547
Only pain, guilt...

891
01:12:57,315 --> 01:12:59,983
Useless, worthless feelings!

892
01:13:01,285 --> 01:13:05,053
I wish to God I'd never even
taken Umezaki's case!

893
01:13:06,422 --> 01:13:08,656
- Kelmot's.
- What?

894
01:13:10,058 --> 01:13:12,659
- Kelmot's case.
You said Umezaki.

895
01:13:16,797 --> 01:13:20,199
- Roger. Tea's ready.

896
01:13:28,474 --> 01:13:29,974
Best clear this up.

897
01:13:43,154 --> 01:13:46,723
Mr. Holmes.
Would you like your tea now?

898
01:13:56,099 --> 01:13:57,265
- Mr. Holmes?

899
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:05,606
If you die...
what'll happen to the bees?

900
01:14:09,243 --> 01:14:10,943
- I haven't a clue.

901
01:14:15,715 --> 01:14:18,149
One can't solve everything.

902
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:29,958
<i> Said to be used
 to call for the dead. </i>

903
01:14:40,133 --> 01:14:42,534
<i> Death, mourning, grief... </i>

904
01:14:48,406 --> 01:14:49,906
<i> They're all commonplace. </i>

905
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:02,417
<i> Logic is rare. </i>

906
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:07,488
- The dead are not
so very far away.

907
01:15:08,623 --> 01:15:10,924
They're just on the other side
of the wall.

908
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:19,097
- Now, whenever
did you say that?

909
01:15:31,276 --> 01:15:34,010
- Ply your parlour tricks
elsewhere, Mr. Holmes.

910
01:15:35,645 --> 01:15:37,278
My husband could never succeed
at deception

911
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,179
so long as I do his laundry.

912
01:15:40,214 --> 01:15:41,214
I don't know much
about your profession,

913
01:15:41,848 --> 01:15:43,048
but I doubt predicting

914
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:44,115
the future of women
you're engaged to follow

915
01:15:44,117 --> 01:15:45,382
is common practice.

916
01:15:46,283 --> 01:15:48,050
- It was intended only
as a means

917
01:15:48,052 --> 01:15:49,051
to achieve a desired result.

918
01:15:50,153 --> 01:15:51,353
- That being what?
- To delay your actions.

919
01:15:52,321 --> 01:15:53,220
To keep you
from this appointment

920
01:15:53,222 --> 01:15:54,954
you seem so eager to make.

921
01:15:57,624 --> 01:15:59,257
Even before
I glimpsed you today,

922
01:16:00,158 --> 01:16:01,191
I'd gleaned some
of the passionate

923
01:16:01,193 --> 01:16:02,692
feelings you have
for your husband.

924
01:16:03,827 --> 01:16:05,360
The man who took away
the music you loved,

925
01:16:06,362 --> 01:16:08,129
denied you the pleasures
of your lessons,

926
01:16:08,131 --> 01:16:10,531
even refused even
to mark a child's grave.

927
01:16:11,533 --> 01:16:13,433
All these predicted
your antipathy.

928
01:16:14,401 --> 01:16:16,135
And then I witnessed
your actions.

929
01:16:16,970 --> 01:16:18,136
<i> Forging his signature, </i>

930
01:16:19,171 --> 01:16:20,871
<i> drawing down his account, </i>

931
01:16:22,206 --> 01:16:23,706
<i> purchasing poison,
 consulting his will, </i>

932
01:16:25,008 --> 01:16:26,008
<i> planning an escape
 with a mystery man </i>

933
01:16:26,010 --> 01:16:27,275
<i> who was paid a handsome fee. </i>

934
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:30,077
And all for my benefit.

935
01:16:30,978 --> 01:16:32,345
A convincing set
of circumstances,

936
01:16:32,347 --> 01:16:36,449
signalling your intention
to murder your husband.

937
01:16:40,586 --> 01:16:42,453
But for two errors.

938
01:16:46,391 --> 01:16:49,292
We must place blame
on your husband for the first.

939
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:52,361
If Mr. Kelmot had not blundered

940
01:16:52,363 --> 01:16:54,062
into Madame Schirmer's
atelier...

941
01:16:54,863 --> 01:16:56,797
<i>and so taken me from my course, </i>

942
01:16:58,266 --> 01:16:59,733
<i> you wouldn't have had
 to loiter on the street</i>

943
01:16:59,735 --> 01:17:02,102
<i> for such a suspiciously long
 period of time. </i>

944
01:17:02,104 --> 01:17:05,071
<i> But you had no choice, 
 so loiter you did. </i>

945
01:17:07,207 --> 01:17:08,340
I would also make
the observation

946
01:17:08,342 --> 01:17:10,075
that there is nothing about you

947
01:17:10,077 --> 01:17:12,677
that signifies the type of woman
who enjoys window shopping,

948
01:17:13,745 --> 01:17:15,912
especially the window
of a taxidermist.

949
01:17:17,347 --> 01:17:18,780
- Was that the second error?

950
01:17:18,782 --> 01:17:20,948
- No, merely confirmation
of the first.

951
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:24,417
The second was unavoidable,
and all the more damning.

952
01:17:25,085 --> 01:17:26,618
The man at the station.

953
01:17:27,252 --> 01:17:28,685
Everything about him,

954
01:17:28,687 --> 01:17:30,553
<i> his clothes,
 the patches on his trousers,</i>

955
01:17:30,555 --> 01:17:34,522
<i> his hands,
 scarred and burned with acid, </i>

956
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:36,223
<i> announced his profession. </i>

957
01:17:36,225 --> 01:17:37,524
Stonemason.

958
01:17:42,195 --> 01:17:44,695
Money must have been
a dire necessity,

959
01:17:46,964 --> 01:17:49,832
else you would never have forged
your husband's signature.

960
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:52,734
The money was to pay
for the headstones

961
01:17:52,736 --> 01:17:53,935
your husband would not allow.

962
01:17:53,937 --> 01:17:55,769
For Grace. For James.

963
01:17:57,538 --> 01:17:58,604
For you.

964
01:18:03,142 --> 01:18:05,543
Was arranging things
to make it look

965
01:18:05,545 --> 01:18:08,311
as if Mr. Kelmot
was the intended victim

966
01:18:09,579 --> 01:18:11,545
simply to keep me off the trail?

967
01:18:13,748 --> 01:18:18,217
- When I found the card...
I was furious.

968
01:18:19,886 --> 01:18:21,720
That Thomas
should know me so little

969
01:18:21,722 --> 01:18:25,222
that he had need to employ a
detective to uncover the truth.

970
01:18:26,390 --> 01:18:27,823
Then it struck me,

971
01:18:28,991 --> 01:18:33,393
if anyone could understand,
it would be you.

972
01:18:36,230 --> 01:18:39,297
Thomas thinks I'm mad
because I speak to my children.

973
01:18:40,499 --> 01:18:42,199
He doesn't understand.

974
01:18:43,467 --> 01:18:46,801
The dead
are not so very far away.

975
01:18:49,471 --> 01:18:50,571
They're just...

976
01:18:52,574 --> 01:18:54,708
on the other side of the wall.

977
01:18:57,578 --> 01:18:59,979
It's us, on this side,
who are, all of us so...

978
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:01,313
- Alone?

979
01:19:06,752 --> 01:19:08,084
I have been alone...

980
01:19:10,954 --> 01:19:12,220
all my life.

981
01:19:14,122 --> 01:19:16,490
But with the compensations
of the intellect.

982
01:19:17,458 --> 01:19:20,359
- And is that enough?
- It can be.

983
01:19:23,296 --> 01:19:26,931
If one is so fortunate
as to find a place in the world.

984
01:19:29,267 --> 01:19:32,835
And another soul with whom
one's loneliness can reside.

985
01:19:34,771 --> 01:19:40,041
- Do you know a place where
two such souls might reside?

986
01:19:50,017 --> 01:19:53,620
<i> It was an offer 
unlike any I had ever received. </i>

987
01:19:55,089 --> 01:19:57,789
<i> She wanted to share
 her solitude with me. </i>

988
01:20:00,058 --> 01:20:01,591
<i> It was only later I realised </i>

989
01:20:01,593 --> 01:20:04,293
<i> how fateful
 my decision would be. </i>

990
01:20:11,066 --> 01:20:13,067
You have a husband
who loves you.

991
01:20:17,138 --> 01:20:18,571
Go home to him.

992
01:20:54,672 --> 01:20:56,539
- Mr. Holmes...

993
01:20:57,307 --> 01:20:58,674
You have my thanks.

994
01:21:00,043 --> 01:21:02,210
- What more, madam, could I do?

995
01:21:25,066 --> 01:21:27,734
<i> She had poured out 
 the contents of the bottle </i>

996
01:21:28,869 --> 01:21:30,169
<i> and,
 with no malice aforethought, </i>

997
01:21:30,171 --> 01:21:32,538
<i>poisoned the innocent witness. </i>

998
01:21:35,975 --> 01:21:38,142
<i> If it had been
 one of John's stories, </i>

999
01:21:38,144 --> 01:21:40,210
<i> he would have called it
 a foreshadowing. </i>

1000
01:22:01,029 --> 01:22:03,663
<i>Our time together was fleeting. </i>

1001
01:22:04,831 --> 01:22:07,899
<i> Less than an hour, really. </i>

1002
01:22:13,004 --> 01:22:16,673
<i> Yet her death made me see 
that human nature was a mystery </i>

1003
01:22:16,675 --> 01:22:19,108
<i> that logic alone
 could not illuminate. </i>

1004
01:22:29,685 --> 01:22:32,753
<i> I had successfully deduced 
 the facts of her case, </i>

1005
01:22:32,755 --> 01:22:35,255
<i> but I had failed
 to grasp their meaning. </i>

1006
01:22:37,224 --> 01:22:39,124
<i> Never had I felt</i>

1007
01:22:39,126 --> 01:22:42,127
<i> such an incomprehensible 
 emptiness within myself. </i>

1008
01:22:45,598 --> 01:22:48,566
<i> Only then did I begin
 to understand </i>

1009
01:22:48,568 --> 01:22:50,834
<i> how utterly alone
 I was in the world. </i>

1010
01:22:57,140 --> 01:22:59,207
<i> Mrs. Hudson wrote to Watson. </i>

1011
01:22:59,875 --> 01:23:01,375
<i> He came at once. </i>

1012
01:23:03,044 --> 01:23:05,845
<i> He stayed with me, in our
 old rooms, for a month more. </i>

1013
01:23:15,889 --> 01:23:19,491
<i> I told him about the case, 
 everything in great detail. </i>

1014
01:23:24,062 --> 01:23:26,063
<i> He brought me back
 from the brink. </i>

1015
01:23:27,432 --> 01:23:30,734
<i> And then Watson
 wrote the story. </i>

1016
01:23:30,736 --> 01:23:32,068
<i> He made me the hero. </i>

1017
01:23:33,403 --> 01:23:35,504
<i> It was his way
 of bestowing a kindness. </i>

1018
01:23:36,973 --> 01:23:38,673
<i> He knew no other manner</i>

1019
01:23:38,675 --> 01:23:41,409
<i> in which to write
 the character he had created. </i>

1020
01:23:42,978 --> 01:23:46,980
<i> After all those years, 
 John didn't know me at all. </i>

1021
01:23:48,349 --> 01:23:50,383
<i> Why he took the glove
 I can only surmise, </i>

1022
01:23:51,952 --> 01:23:53,953
<i> was it to prevent it becoming
 too powerful a reminder, </i>

1023
01:23:53,955 --> 01:23:56,121
<i> to keep it from being
 a well of sadness</i>

1024
01:23:56,123 --> 01:23:58,189
<i> to which I might return? </i>

1025
01:23:59,524 --> 01:24:02,325
<i>But he could not bring himself 
 to destroy it either. </i>

1026
01:24:03,593 --> 01:24:05,360
<i> After that,
 John and I were estranged. </i>

1027
01:24:06,595 --> 01:24:08,862
<i> Three years later,
 he too was gone, </i>

1028
01:24:08,864 --> 01:24:11,531
<i> without us ever
 having said goodbye. </i>

1029
01:24:27,848 --> 01:24:29,949
<i> And thus concludes
 the true story </i>

1030
01:24:29,951 --> 01:24:32,785
<i> of a woman
 who died before her time, </i>

1031
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:35,721
<i>and a man who, until recently, </i>

1032
01:24:35,723 --> 01:24:38,389
<i> was certain
 he had outlived his. </i>

1033
01:24:47,296 --> 01:24:48,929
Roger with the bees?

1034
01:24:49,630 --> 01:24:50,963
- Like as not.

1035
01:24:50,965 --> 01:24:52,464
- Must tell him
something important.

1036
01:24:53,732 --> 01:24:55,799
You continue with
whatever it was you were doing.

1037
01:24:58,869 --> 01:25:01,470
- You might ask him
where the watering can's got to!

1038
01:25:57,090 --> 01:25:59,858
- Ambulance?
Yes, this is Headly House.

1039
01:25:59,860 --> 01:26:01,226
<i> Headly? 
- Yes, quickly!</i>

1040
01:26:01,228 --> 01:26:02,860
And bring some supplies
of adrenaline.

1041
01:26:04,429 --> 01:26:05,762
<i>- Headly House? 
- That's right, Headly!</i>

1042
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:35,623
- Roger?

1043
01:26:36,891 --> 01:26:38,024
Roger!

1044
01:26:39,126 --> 01:26:40,326
Roger?

1045
01:26:41,895 --> 01:26:45,831
Oh, Roger. Oh, no!
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1046
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:47,699
Roger. Oh, Roger!

1047
01:27:11,421 --> 01:27:12,554
- Mr. Holmes?

1048
01:27:14,957 --> 01:27:16,724
It's Inspector Gilbert.

1049
01:27:20,194 --> 01:27:21,394
Mr. Holmes?

1050
01:27:24,798 --> 01:27:26,365
- Yes, Inspector?

1051
01:27:27,667 --> 01:27:29,801
- They're giving the boy
injections of adrenaline,

1052
01:27:29,803 --> 01:27:31,369
as you said to, but...

1053
01:27:33,138 --> 01:27:34,338
he's not looking good.

1054
01:27:35,173 --> 01:27:37,273
- He was fleeing his attackers.

1055
01:27:39,442 --> 01:27:40,875
His footprints.

1056
01:27:42,277 --> 01:27:45,512
Their pattern shows that
his flight was disorientated.

1057
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:48,347
The swarm must have followed him
in their attack.

1058
01:27:49,282 --> 01:27:50,115
And before
he lost consciousness,

1059
01:27:50,117 --> 01:27:51,483
his skin would have flushed,

1060
01:27:51,485 --> 01:27:54,218
accompanied by burning pain...

1061
01:27:55,453 --> 01:27:57,887
A drop in blood pressure,
weakness.

1062
01:27:59,623 --> 01:28:01,624
His throat and mouth
would be swollen

1063
01:28:01,626 --> 01:28:03,858
which explains
why he didn't call for help.

1064
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:07,561
Then a drop in heart rate...

1065
01:28:08,796 --> 01:28:10,896
Inability to breathe...

1066
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:14,632
Shock.

1067
01:28:15,667 --> 01:28:17,034
- Did you know
he was allergic to bees?

1068
01:28:24,641 --> 01:28:26,775
- I was certain he wasn't.

1069
01:29:49,723 --> 01:29:51,824
No, no! No, Mrs. Munro, no!

1070
01:29:52,425 --> 01:29:53,792
You mustn't do that!

1071
01:29:54,894 --> 01:29:57,861
- My son... won't wake.

1072
01:30:00,564 --> 01:30:01,964
He may never wake.

1073
01:30:02,799 --> 01:30:04,699
They sent me away till morning.

1074
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:07,101
You didn't even have the decency

1075
01:30:07,103 --> 01:30:08,802
to tell me
what'd happened to him!

1076
01:30:10,337 --> 01:30:12,839
- I didn't think
it would make a difference.

1077
01:30:12,841 --> 01:30:14,240
- I'm his mother!

1078
01:30:15,508 --> 01:30:17,008
I'm his mother...

1079
01:30:18,510 --> 01:30:20,444
And you stole him from me!

1080
01:30:20,446 --> 01:30:21,945
He's all I had!

1081
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,180
And I've lost him now.

1082
01:30:25,415 --> 01:30:27,783
Why wasn't it you
they did it to?

1083
01:30:29,118 --> 01:30:31,552
It should've been you!
- The bees were not to blame.

1084
01:30:31,554 --> 01:30:32,886
- They're all you care about!

1085
01:30:32,888 --> 01:30:34,621
- No! I care about Roger.

1086
01:30:35,389 --> 01:30:37,723
I care about him very much.

1087
01:30:50,133 --> 01:30:53,201
The bees... didn't do it.

1088
01:30:54,636 --> 01:30:57,170
The bees were not to blame.

1089
01:31:06,613 --> 01:31:08,779
It was the wasps!

1090
01:31:08,781 --> 01:31:11,481
Roger was trying to find out
what was killing the bees.

1091
01:31:11,483 --> 01:31:14,450
And he did.
He found the wasps' nest.

1092
01:31:14,452 --> 01:31:16,919
He had to stop them
wiping out the bees.

1093
01:31:16,921 --> 01:31:19,321
And so he did
the worst possible thing.

1094
01:31:19,323 --> 01:31:22,157
He tried to drown them
with water from his can.

1095
01:31:22,958 --> 01:31:24,992
- How do you know it was them?

1096
01:31:24,994 --> 01:31:27,794
- Bees leave their stings.
Wasps don't.

1097
01:31:27,796 --> 01:31:30,296
There were no stings left
in Roger's face.

1098
01:31:30,298 --> 01:31:32,598
And when they attacked,
he dropped the watering can

1099
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:34,399
and ran up to protect the bees.

1100
01:31:34,401 --> 01:31:37,334
There are his footprints from
the apiary to the nest and back.

1101
01:31:38,302 --> 01:31:40,169
- He was trying
to save the bees.

1102
01:31:40,171 --> 01:31:41,369
- Yes.

1103
01:31:43,505 --> 01:31:44,838
Yes.

1104
01:32:26,946 --> 01:32:29,047
There was a woman, once.

1105
01:32:29,815 --> 01:32:31,782
I knew her less than a day.

1106
01:32:32,817 --> 01:32:34,350
A quarter of an hour's
conversation.

1107
01:32:36,286 --> 01:32:37,953
She needed my help.

1108
01:32:39,488 --> 01:32:42,256
She needed so desperately
to be understood by someone...

1109
01:32:44,025 --> 01:32:45,558
Me.

1110
01:32:47,027 --> 01:32:49,528
So, I laid out the particulars
of her case as I saw them...

1111
01:32:50,363 --> 01:32:52,197
To her satisfaction, I thought.

1112
01:32:53,165 --> 01:32:55,232
I watched her walk away.

1113
01:32:56,467 --> 01:32:58,700
And within hours
she'd ended her life.

1114
01:33:01,503 --> 01:33:04,805
By identifying the cause of
her despair with such clarity,

1115
01:33:04,807 --> 01:33:08,408
I'd given her carte blanche
to do just as she intended.

1116
01:33:10,744 --> 01:33:13,878
I should've done
whatever it took to save her.

1117
01:33:15,180 --> 01:33:17,714
Lie to her, make up a story.

1118
01:33:19,383 --> 01:33:23,185
Take her by the hand
and hold her as she wept,

1119
01:33:23,187 --> 01:33:25,420
and said, "Come live with me.

1120
01:33:26,922 --> 01:33:28,989
Let us be alone together."

1121
01:33:33,260 --> 01:33:36,629
But I was fearful.

1122
01:33:39,999 --> 01:33:41,265
Selfish.

1123
01:33:45,836 --> 01:33:48,204
She's the reason...

1124
01:33:48,206 --> 01:33:50,239
I came here to my bees,

1125
01:33:51,374 --> 01:33:54,075
so that I couldn't harm
anyone ever again.

1126
01:33:58,346 --> 01:34:00,412
I'm leaving you the house.

1127
01:34:02,214 --> 01:34:03,914
You and Roger.

1128
01:34:05,283 --> 01:34:10,753
House, grounds, apiary,
everything within and without.

1129
01:34:10,755 --> 01:34:12,421
And as I shan't change my mind

1130
01:34:12,423 --> 01:34:14,389
on this point,
you will see, I trust,

1131
01:34:14,391 --> 01:34:18,459
that it will be greatly less
complicated for all concerned

1132
01:34:18,461 --> 01:34:20,060
if the two of you

1133
01:34:20,062 --> 01:34:21,694
don't go off...

1134
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:25,264
...to somewhere like...
Portsmouth.

1135
01:34:29,368 --> 01:34:30,768
- Mrs. Munro?

1136
01:34:31,302 --> 01:34:32,769
Roger's awake.

1137
01:35:15,278 --> 01:35:18,346
- Dear Mr. Umezaki,

1138
01:35:19,681 --> 01:35:22,649
<i> I write to tell you
 that I have at last </i>

1139
01:35:22,651 --> 01:35:24,850
<i> recalled my meeting
 with your father. </i>

1140
01:35:27,086 --> 01:35:30,987
<i> A woman had died because
 I failed to solve her case. </i>

1141
01:35:32,522 --> 01:35:35,690
<i> Guilt and recrimination 
having taken their toll on me, </i>

1142
01:35:35,692 --> 01:35:38,325
<i> my powers
 were far from at their best </i>

1143
01:35:39,527 --> 01:35:41,427
<i> when I received
 an urgent message </i>

1144
01:35:42,662 --> 01:35:44,095
<i> summoning me
 to the Diogenes Club </i>

1145
01:35:44,097 --> 01:35:46,596
<i> to meet
 with my brother Mycroft. </i>

1146
01:35:48,432 --> 01:35:51,100
- This gentleman has made
an offer of service.

1147
01:35:51,935 --> 01:35:53,534
He wishes to work for the Crown.

1148
01:35:55,837 --> 01:35:58,004
- I'm here to be tested,
Mr. Holmes.

1149
01:35:58,872 --> 01:36:00,739
<i>I very much want to be of use. </i>

1150
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:02,840
Do you think that I am suited?

1151
01:36:03,308 --> 01:36:04,541
- I'm sure, sir.

1152
01:36:05,476 --> 01:36:07,844
- Good.
There is one minor issue.

1153
01:36:07,846 --> 01:36:10,713
Mr. Umezaki
has a wife and child in Japan.

1154
01:36:11,815 --> 01:36:13,582
He wonders
what would be the best course.

1155
01:36:23,359 --> 01:36:27,095
- Write a letter saying
you plan to stay on in England.

1156
01:36:28,197 --> 01:36:30,063
Could be a long while
until your return.

1157
01:36:32,232 --> 01:36:33,732
<i> Your father went on to serve </i>

1158
01:36:33,734 --> 01:36:36,835
<i> the British Empire
 for many years </i>

1159
01:36:36,837 --> 01:36:40,404
<i> in absolute secrecy and
with the greatest distinction, </i>

1160
01:36:41,339 --> 01:36:42,472
from...

1161
01:36:52,382 --> 01:36:56,651
the Malay... Straits...

1162
01:36:56,653 --> 01:37:01,555
to the Arabian Sea.

1163
01:37:04,158 --> 01:37:06,859
<i> He was a man of courage,
heart and dignity,</i>

1164
01:37:06,861 --> 01:37:09,595
<i> of whom a beloved wife
 and cherished son </i>

1165
01:37:09,597 --> 01:37:12,998
may be deservedly proud.

1166
01:37:14,033 --> 01:37:17,068
Sherlock Holmes.

1167
01:37:22,907 --> 01:37:24,107
Hmmm.

1168
01:37:37,620 --> 01:37:38,987
My friend John.

1169
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:50,364
My brother Mycroft.

1170
01:37:53,601 --> 01:37:54,934
Mrs. Hudson.

1171
01:37:55,802 --> 01:37:57,703
Masuo Umezaki.

1172
01:37:58,671 --> 01:38:01,806
Maya... Umezaki.

1173
01:38:07,511 --> 01:38:08,944
Ann.

1174
01:38:13,315 --> 01:38:15,115
And who is that one for?

1175
01:38:15,916 --> 01:38:17,883
- Me. You.

1176
01:38:19,652 --> 01:38:21,785
- Well, not yet awhile, surely?

1177
01:38:24,321 --> 01:38:26,121
- Did you finish
what you had to do?

1178
01:38:26,689 --> 01:38:28,289
- Yes, I did.

1179
01:38:29,391 --> 01:38:31,425
My first foray
into the world of fiction.

1180
01:38:32,927 --> 01:38:35,795
One shouldn't leave this life
without a sense of completion.

1181
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,734
You can use this
in one of your stories.

1182
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:48,571
A glass, a bee...

1183
01:38:50,106 --> 01:38:51,605
and Roger.

1184
01:38:54,342 --> 01:38:55,909
- Show me how to knock them out.

1185
01:39:00,047 --> 01:39:01,247
- Go on.

1186
01:39:06,419 --> 01:39:08,620
- The queen runs the colony.
- Mm-hmm.

1187
01:39:08,622 --> 01:39:10,722
- The drones service the queen.

1188
01:39:10,724 --> 01:39:12,790
The workers do the work.

1189
01:39:12,792 --> 01:39:14,792
- Isn't it true?
