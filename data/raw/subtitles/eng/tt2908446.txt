1
00:00:41,428 --> 00:00:43,464
Peace.

2
00:00:43,862 --> 00:00:45,053
Long ago...

3
00:00:45,105 --> 00:00:48,756
Before the Founders established
this great city of ours,

4
00:00:48,994 --> 00:00:54,321
that word was all but meaningless.
An ideal as elusive as a dream.

5
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:57,367
Now, 200 years later,

6
00:00:57,492 --> 00:01:02,291
We are, all of us, living proof
that peace is indeed attainable.

7
00:01:02,565 --> 00:01:06,245
The reason for this is,
of course, our faction system:

8
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:10,960
Erudite, Dauntless,
Amity, Candor, Abnegation.

9
00:01:11,265 --> 00:01:14,669
In dividing people according
to personality and aptitude,

10
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:18,447
we've created a society in which
each faction plays a critical role

11
00:01:18,605 --> 00:01:21,095
in maintaining the social order.

12
00:01:21,295 --> 00:01:24,316
But this harmony we've achieved
is now under attack

13
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:28,028
from a small but extremely
dangerous group of individuals

14
00:01:28,204 --> 00:01:31,138
We call them "Divergents".

15
00:01:31,338 --> 00:01:35,465
They are, in essence, the worst
of what humanity used to be:

16
00:01:35,547 --> 00:01:39,678
rebellious, defiant, and uncontrollable.

17
00:01:40,449 --> 00:01:43,353
Five days ago,
a rogue group of Divergents

18
00:01:43,378 --> 00:01:46,765
posing as Dauntless brutally
invaded Abnegation:

19
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,129
an obvious attempt
to cripple the faction system

20
00:01:49,154 --> 00:01:51,667
by attacking its
most vulnerable members.

21
00:01:53,589 --> 00:01:58,232
These Divergents despise our system because
they are incapable of conforming to it.

22
00:01:58,271 --> 00:01:59,738
These latest rumours,
for example,

23
00:01:59,763 --> 00:02:02,936
that I was somehow behind the
attack on Abnegation:

24
00:02:02,961 --> 00:02:06,861
nothing more than Divergent propaganda.

25
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:11,831
I am devoting myself to bringing
these fugitives to justice.

26
00:02:11,856 --> 00:02:15,769
I've exercised my right as acting
council leader to declare martial law

27
00:02:15,794 --> 00:02:20,476
until I'm confident that any threat
to our security has been eliminated.

28
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:22,866
Tell Jeanine we got it.

29
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,622
We are all that is left of humanity.

30
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,308
The vast wall that encloses this city

31
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:33,462
may protect us from our toxic surroundings,

32
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:38,203
but it is up to us to confront any element
that could poison us from within.

33
00:02:38,228 --> 00:02:41,075
Because when you are
civilization's last hope,

34
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,419
peace is not merely an ideal:

35
00:02:43,444 --> 00:02:45,674
it is an obligation.

36
00:02:46,102 --> 00:02:50,654
And it is up to all us to take a stand
against its one true enemy:

37
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,567
Divergents.

38
00:02:58,092 --> 00:03:03,208
(Labored panting)

39
00:03:04,534 --> 00:03:09,528
(Crows cawing loudly)

40
00:03:25,867 --> 00:03:27,107
Amity!

41
00:03:29,314 --> 00:03:31,379
We need to make sure it's clear.

42
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:33,772
Tris!

43
00:03:50,216 --> 00:03:53,843
Help us. Please, help us. Please!

44
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:57,851
Please, help us. You have to help us!

45
00:03:57,876 --> 00:04:00,647
Sorry, you have to leave.

46
00:04:00,672 --> 00:04:04,545
- You just don't belong here.
- It's all her fault.

47
00:04:10,058 --> 00:04:12,171
You killed Will.

48
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:14,050
No...

49
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:18,922
(Crowd whispers, repeatedly) She killed...

50
00:04:25,611 --> 00:04:26,725
Mom!

51
00:04:31,255 --> 00:04:32,805
You've killed us all.

52
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,412
Will!

53
00:06:26,922 --> 00:06:30,559
- And... Three!
- Higher!

54
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:33,477
Hey.

55
00:06:33,502 --> 00:06:36,099
- Higher, higher!
- You want to go higher?

56
00:06:36,514 --> 00:06:39,969
- Alright, everyone,
back to class. Let's go!
- Okay, here we go.

57
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:41,709
See you.

58
00:06:53,518 --> 00:06:55,419
I just wanted to do something different.

59
00:06:57,406 --> 00:06:58,751
Yeah.

60
00:07:10,454 --> 00:07:12,134
Well, that's definitely different.

61
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:18,302
- You don't like it?
- No, I like it. I like it a lot.

62
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:20,879
I'm just surprised, that's all.

63
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,641
- What's going on, Tris?
- Nothing. I'm fine.

64
00:07:27,027 --> 00:07:28,757
Just...

65
00:07:30,454 --> 00:07:32,118
Still having nightmares?

66
00:07:35,562 --> 00:07:36,780
No.

67
00:07:41,508 --> 00:07:42,851
We're good.

68
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,016
You and me.

69
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,733
I know nothing else
is, but we are.

70
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,605
Time for chores.

71
00:08:12,632 --> 00:08:14,798
How much longer do we
have to stay here, Four?

72
00:08:15,102 --> 00:08:16,760
Until we know it's safe to leave.

73
00:08:47,388 --> 00:08:50,206
- Hey.
- Hey.

74
00:08:51,142 --> 00:08:52,506
Son.

75
00:08:55,241 --> 00:08:57,146
You can't ignore me forever.

76
00:08:59,346 --> 00:09:01,233
I know you're thinking
about your next move,

77
00:09:01,258 --> 00:09:02,621
but there are things
you don't know.

78
00:09:02,646 --> 00:09:04,820
Marcus, please just leave us alone.

79
00:09:06,668 --> 00:09:09,376
Your mother didn't come back to
Abnegation just to save you.

80
00:09:09,576 --> 00:09:11,366
She died trying to hide
something from Jeanine.

81
00:09:11,391 --> 00:09:12,975
Something that was entrusted
to Abnegation

82
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,661
- a long time ago.
- Marcus! Stop!

83
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,675
Whatever you want from us,
you're not going to get it.

84
00:09:21,316 --> 00:09:23,362
I'm not the enemy here.

85
00:09:35,631 --> 00:09:37,442
You found it...

86
00:09:40,734 --> 00:09:44,608
It was in the home of Natalie
and Andrew Prior, like you said.

87
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:54,038
You mind telling me what's inside?

88
00:09:54,617 --> 00:09:55,886
A message from the Founders

89
00:09:55,911 --> 00:09:59,029
that will ensure the future
our people deserve.

90
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:08,396
Divergents will destroy our society.
Unless we destroy them.

91
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,837
And now we can.

92
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:19,139
However, only a Divergent
can open this box.

93
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,147
Find them.

94
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,978
Every last one of them.

95
00:10:47,235 --> 00:10:48,747
Go with happiness.

96
00:10:49,826 --> 00:10:51,276
Go with happiness.

97
00:10:52,972 --> 00:10:54,532
- Go with happiness.
- Thank you.

98
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:57,084
Go with happiness.

99
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:00,705
Go with happiness.

100
00:11:02,012 --> 00:11:05,083
I really don't know how much longer I
can do this whole peace and love thing.

101
00:11:05,647 --> 00:11:07,726
It's the Amity way, alright.
Just try to blend in.

102
00:11:08,562 --> 00:11:10,022
I'm trying to blend in.

103
00:11:10,047 --> 00:11:11,545
It's just not working.

104
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,074
Coming through, on your right.
Hey, here we go.

105
00:11:14,099 --> 00:11:16,813
Hey, look: a rainbow. It's pretty.

106
00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:20,821
Virtual pathological friendliness
with unquestioned pacifism.

107
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:21,665
I love this place.

108
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,884
Thank you. Go with happiness.

109
00:11:24,408 --> 00:11:27,550
Oops, excuse me.
Hey, Tris, I really like
your hair by the way.

110
00:11:27,575 --> 00:11:29,614
Did you try to cut it
all short and weird like that?

111
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:32,320
Peter, why don't you take your food and sit down, huh?

112
00:11:32,345 --> 00:11:33,506
Or what?

113
00:11:35,882 --> 00:11:39,152
Besides, I think we all should all
stick together now that we're
all officially fugitives.

114
00:11:39,177 --> 00:11:41,207
Wait what do you mean
"officially fugitives"?

115
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:43,644
Ah, you don't know?
You didn't tell Caleb?

116
00:11:44,178 --> 00:11:46,610
Yeah, so now Jeanine is saying
that the attack on Abnegation

117
00:11:46,635 --> 00:11:50,801
was orchestrated by a group of
renegade Divergents and their sympathizers.

118
00:11:50,984 --> 00:11:53,594
- So they're blaming this
whole thing on us?
- Yeah.

119
00:11:53,619 --> 00:11:55,300
Jeanine needed a reason
to petition to the

120
00:11:55,325 --> 00:11:57,231
council to institute martial law.

121
00:11:57,868 --> 00:11:59,222
Now she has one.

122
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:10,964
Staying here at Amity is still
our best option for now.

123
00:12:11,617 --> 00:12:12,962
We need to keep an ear to the ground,

124
00:12:12,987 --> 00:12:14,721
find out where the rest of
the Dauntless are...

125
00:12:15,737 --> 00:12:16,965
Then we can make a move.

126
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:19,586
We need to kill Jeanine.

127
00:12:21,327 --> 00:12:23,801
I know, we're not ready yet.

128
00:12:28,578 --> 00:12:31,078
Beatrice, you're not
being serious, right?

129
00:12:31,144 --> 00:12:32,520
No, I am being serious...

130
00:12:33,909 --> 00:12:36,049
I'm not going to stop until she's dead.

131
00:12:36,284 --> 00:12:38,352
Tris, you can't just go
around killing people.

132
00:12:38,377 --> 00:12:40,021
No, she's right. Listen to your sister.

133
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,332
Tris, I think you should go to Erudite

134
00:12:42,357 --> 00:12:43,962
and kill Jeanine yourself.

135
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:47,046
I'll stay with Caleb so
that you don't get him killed too.

136
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:51,876
What?

137
00:12:52,531 --> 00:12:53,955
Come on, you know.

138
00:12:55,452 --> 00:12:57,058
Like you did your parents.

139
00:13:14,243 --> 00:13:15,341
Stop!

140
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:17,933
What do you think you're doing?

141
00:13:20,275 --> 00:13:22,403
- My office! Now!

142
00:13:24,686 --> 00:13:27,662
Enjoy your meal, everyone, enjoy your meal.

143
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:29,903
Calm down. Just calm down, alright?

144
00:13:36,124 --> 00:13:40,981
Was I not clear that the
terms of your sanctuary
here included non violence?

145
00:13:41,937 --> 00:13:44,881
Well, I can guarantee you
nothing like this will ever
happen again.

146
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:49,792
Well, be that as it may,
you can no longer stay here with us.

147
00:13:50,465 --> 00:13:53,389
Your presence is just too disruptive.

148
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:59,514
The truth is that our sanctuary was never
going to last very long here anyway...

149
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,263
Was it?
With you not standing up to Jeanine.

150
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:07,542
- You don't understand us at all.
- No, I do understand you.

151
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:10,659
I understand that you think you can
stay out of this, but you can't.

152
00:14:11,042 --> 00:14:12,999
One day, she's going to show up
and Jeanine is going to take

153
00:14:13,024 --> 00:14:14,784
whatever power you think
you have away from you.

154
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:16,137
Tris! Tris!

155
00:14:19,576 --> 00:14:22,863
Look, Johanna, we need a little more time.

156
00:14:23,893 --> 00:14:26,830
I need to find out where the rest of
the Dauntless are, then we can leave.

157
00:14:26,855 --> 00:14:29,722
And then what? Attack Erudite?

158
00:14:30,007 --> 00:14:33,781
- I will not be a party to violence.
- And no one is asking you to.

159
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,073
We just need a few more days.

160
00:14:40,286 --> 00:14:41,419
One.

161
00:14:43,658 --> 00:14:45,011
One, what?

162
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,507
One more chance.

163
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:55,699
See, to be Amity
is to forgive others...

164
00:14:55,724 --> 00:14:56,824
and yourself.

165
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,875
You're hurting, Tris.

166
00:15:03,635 --> 00:15:05,986
And my heart goes out to you.

167
00:15:07,546 --> 00:15:13,352
I know what it's like to stand helpless
while you lose the ones you love.

168
00:15:15,225 --> 00:15:18,140
But killing Jeanine is not
going to bring your mother back.

169
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:23,249
I know you're angry, but
you're letting it consume you.

170
00:15:23,988 --> 00:15:25,633
(Persistent knocking, downstairs)

171
00:15:26,953 --> 00:15:28,203
What is it?

172
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:48,730
Stay here and keep quiet.

173
00:16:09,508 --> 00:16:13,077
Gentlemen, Amity welcomes you.

174
00:16:13,301 --> 00:16:14,564
To what do we
owe the pleasure?

175
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:16,396
This isn't really a
social call, Johanna.

176
00:16:16,421 --> 00:16:19,480
- We're looking for Divergents.
- I see.

177
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,624
Well, of course, anything
we can do to help.

178
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:23,839
We need you to volunteer
your faction to be tested.

179
00:16:26,471 --> 00:16:28,699
- New screening technology from Erudite.
- Amity.

180
00:16:28,724 --> 00:16:30,507
Now that Jeanine is heading up the council,

181
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:32,438
the approval process
just got a little easier.

182
00:16:32,905 --> 00:16:35,811
- You're exceeding your jurisdiction.
- Now, Johanna.

183
00:16:36,446 --> 00:16:38,680
What happened to that Amity politeness?

184
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:45,095
The easy way or the hard way?
It's up to you.

185
00:16:49,477 --> 00:16:52,946
Alright, but under protest.

186
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,964
Okay, we're good to go!

187
00:16:55,989 --> 00:16:57,466
- Move it out!
- Round them up!

188
00:16:57,898 --> 00:16:58,928
Give it a go.

189
00:16:58,953 --> 00:17:03,943
All Amity report to the dome
for new mandatory testing.

190
00:17:04,814 --> 00:17:08,662
Please proceed to the dome
for mandatory testing.

191
00:17:10,277 --> 00:17:13,841
In the building, let's go!
Get inside! Line up!

192
00:17:17,086 --> 00:17:19,176
- Let's go! Move it!
- This way!

193
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:23,313
Line it up!

194
00:17:24,052 --> 00:17:25,269
Dome is secure.

195
00:17:27,768 --> 00:17:29,573
You know something, lady?

196
00:17:31,111 --> 00:17:33,591
You seem awfully stuck in that doorway.

197
00:17:45,746 --> 00:17:49,186
Eric is here.
We need to move now, come on.

198
00:17:57,176 --> 00:18:00,892
- What's up there?
- Just my office.

199
00:18:02,755 --> 00:18:04,021
(Horse neighs)

200
00:18:07,871 --> 00:18:09,233
Go, go, go.

201
00:18:23,116 --> 00:18:24,460
There's two guards with guns.

202
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,198
We're going out the window?

203
00:18:29,631 --> 00:18:31,331
We need to split up.

204
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:35,124
Okay, yeah. Okay.

205
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,809
Every man for himself.

206
00:18:38,814 --> 00:18:39,962
Good.

207
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:43,136
Hey, they're up here! Hey, hey!

208
00:18:44,608 --> 00:18:46,693
Eric, they're up here!
Come on, they're getting away!

209
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,675
You ready?

210
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,699
- Where?
- Out the window!

211
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,419
I got three on foot making a break
toward the dome!

212
00:19:09,444 --> 00:19:11,452
- Divergent.
- Got one!

213
00:19:11,838 --> 00:19:13,932
I repeat: three on foot, toward the dome.

214
00:19:13,957 --> 00:19:15,426
Over there!

215
00:19:16,215 --> 00:19:17,822
- I demand amnesty!
- Get down, now!

216
00:19:17,847 --> 00:19:20,373
I'm the leader of Abnegation,
it's my right!

217
00:19:28,608 --> 00:19:29,802
Detain him!

218
00:19:29,827 --> 00:19:30,887
- Woah.
- Let's go!

219
00:19:30,912 --> 00:19:32,023
Okay.

220
00:19:40,484 --> 00:19:42,186
Come on, keep moving!

221
00:19:52,751 --> 00:19:53,864
Run!

222
00:19:54,576 --> 00:19:55,728
Run!

223
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:05,600
Come on!

224
00:20:40,526 --> 00:20:42,016
- Listen!
- What?

225
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,072
A train!

226
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:46,720
Go, go, go, go, go!

227
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,200
Caleb!

228
00:20:54,178 --> 00:20:55,304
Keep moving.

229
00:21:04,871 --> 00:21:06,115
Ammo!

230
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:22,487
Come on, go! Move!

231
00:21:41,629 --> 00:21:43,622
- Move! Go, go, go, go!
- Caleb!

232
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:45,968
Move!

233
00:22:21,689 --> 00:22:24,505
Oh, you folks sure know
how to make an entrance!

234
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,249
- Factionless.
- Amity.

235
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,308
Oh, you stand like Dauntless.

236
00:22:37,068 --> 00:22:38,694
Well, I have no idea what this one is.

237
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:43,376
- Look, we just need to get
to the city. That's all.
- Well, too bad, train's taken.

238
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,266
And you damaged our cargo.

239
00:22:49,499 --> 00:22:53,739
These are Abnegation fabric bolts
and you are factionless, right?

240
00:22:53,764 --> 00:22:55,371
- Caleb!
- I used to be Abnegation.

241
00:22:55,396 --> 00:22:58,524
We used to use those same bolts
to make clothes for you.

242
00:23:00,508 --> 00:23:02,525
Are you saying that
we're stealing from you?

243
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:06,685
No, no, I'm no longer Abnegation,
so technically you're not stealing from me.

244
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,569
But... No, you're not stealing at all.

245
00:23:09,241 --> 00:23:10,619
It's... I mean...

246
00:23:10,644 --> 00:23:13,813
Maybe it's a question of
semantics, I suppose,
whether it's stealing or charity.

247
00:23:13,838 --> 00:23:15,694
- But it's all really the same.
- That's enough!

248
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:18,719
Everybody, relax, alright.
You've made your point.

249
00:23:18,744 --> 00:23:21,835
- We'll get off your train, alright.
- Guys, would everybody just relax?

250
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,666
Okay, why don't we, uh... Take a seat!

251
00:23:26,215 --> 00:23:27,233
Caleb!

252
00:23:27,705 --> 00:23:29,592
- I'm sorry, I was just trying to help!
- Don't.

253
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:31,086
Oh, yeah, this is going
to be fun. Isn't it?

254
00:23:31,111 --> 00:23:33,124
Everybody just calm down, alright?

255
00:24:53,694 --> 00:24:54,734
Caleb...

256
00:25:01,677 --> 00:25:03,842
Get off! Get... off!

257
00:25:31,356 --> 00:25:32,624
- You alright?
- Yeah.

258
00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:33,918
Okay.

259
00:25:45,108 --> 00:25:46,516
Tobias Eaton.

260
00:25:46,541 --> 00:25:48,094
You say that again.

261
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:50,662
Tobias Eaton.

262
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,192
What? You know him?

263
00:25:55,627 --> 00:25:56,945
I am him.

264
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,255
We have been looking for you.

265
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:10,631
What? What are they talking about?
Four!

266
00:26:26,696 --> 00:26:27,862
Follow me.

267
00:26:33,376 --> 00:26:36,215
Tris! I'm sorry, I wanted to help. I...

268
00:26:46,652 --> 00:26:51,207
Four! Four! Why are they looking for you?

269
00:26:52,014 --> 00:26:53,744
How do they know your your name?

270
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,420
This is factionless?

271
00:27:10,199 --> 00:27:11,983
This is insane.

272
00:27:48,102 --> 00:27:49,313
Tobias!

273
00:27:53,874 --> 00:27:55,081
Mother.

274
00:28:01,801 --> 00:28:03,346
I thought she was dead.

275
00:28:06,897 --> 00:28:08,057
Me, too.

276
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:26,844
Will someone please tell me
what's going on here?

277
00:28:31,511 --> 00:28:34,531
Tobias' father was very abusive.

278
00:28:35,611 --> 00:28:39,130
I knew the only way I could ever
truly escape him would be to...

279
00:28:39,155 --> 00:28:41,086
disappear completely.

280
00:28:43,442 --> 00:28:46,267
Abnegation helped me fake my death.

281
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:49,395
Anything to protect Marcus' image.

282
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,352
But you just left him there
alone with Marcus.

283
00:28:52,651 --> 00:28:54,380
I was very young.

284
00:28:56,087 --> 00:28:58,248
I reached out to him about a year ago.

285
00:28:58,859 --> 00:29:01,719
I felt it was finally time to reconnect.

286
00:29:03,245 --> 00:29:06,801
- I'm still your mother.
- No, my mother is dead.

287
00:29:08,316 --> 00:29:10,488
I went to her funeral when I was six.

288
00:29:12,122 --> 00:29:15,845
And she wasn't trying to reconnect with me.
She was trying to use me.

289
00:29:16,253 --> 00:29:17,836
Like you are now.

290
00:29:17,938 --> 00:29:18,938
Why?

291
00:29:19,636 --> 00:29:20,956
She wants an army.

292
00:29:21,904 --> 00:29:22,925
- An army?

293
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,875
- I want an alliance.
- No, what you want is revenge!

294
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,893
This isn't about me.
It's about putting an end to a system that

295
00:29:28,918 --> 00:29:31,646
says one group is more
deserving than another.

296
00:29:31,671 --> 00:29:36,384
This city may be surrounded by a wall,
but it doesn't have to be a prison.

297
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,382
I think that's a bit extreme.

298
00:29:38,407 --> 00:29:41,839
I mean, the faction system isn't meant
to be perfect, but it's hardly a prison.

299
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:45,294
Let me guess: Erudite?

300
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,438
I was Erudite.

301
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:57,032
- You willing to kill Jeanine?
- Absolutely.

302
00:29:58,224 --> 00:30:00,694
When I was married to Marcus,
I knew her well.

303
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:03,375
And believe me,
there's nothing she is incapable of.

304
00:30:03,758 --> 00:30:08,265
- But I think you already know that.
- Tris, we can't trust her.

305
00:30:09,255 --> 00:30:12,417
- Maybe she knows...
- We're on the same side, Tris.

306
00:30:13,303 --> 00:30:16,632
I'm factionless because
I don't fit in any one faction.

307
00:30:16,657 --> 00:30:20,036
And you're Divergent because
you belong to too many...

308
00:30:20,061 --> 00:30:22,698
But we are both a threat to Jeanine.

309
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:26,380
My people are ready for war,
if that's what it takes.

310
00:30:26,405 --> 00:30:27,405
And then what?

311
00:30:29,136 --> 00:30:32,900
- We depose those in power.
- And once you've done that?

312
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:37,146
Once you've killed Jeanine,
who's in power then?

313
00:30:38,013 --> 00:30:42,567
You see, that's the part that
she always conveniently leaves out.

314
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:48,078
Don't you tell me this isn't about you:
this is only about you.

315
00:30:50,707 --> 00:30:53,778
I know where the remaining
Dauntless are hiding.

316
00:30:53,803 --> 00:30:56,666
- Where?
- They took shelter in Candor.

317
00:30:56,691 --> 00:30:58,780
As far as I know they're still there.

318
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,478
Think about it. If we were
to combine forces,

319
00:31:02,503 --> 00:31:06,773
Dauntless and factionless.
We'd be unstoppable.

320
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:07,939
That's not going to happen.

321
00:31:08,349 --> 00:31:12,829
Thank you for your hospitality,
but we will be leaving in the morning.

322
00:31:12,924 --> 00:31:14,108
Four, maybe this is...

323
00:31:14,346 --> 00:31:17,117
Tobias, please reconsider.

324
00:31:17,274 --> 00:31:18,889
Don't you call me that.

325
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:22,886
My name is Four.

326
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,711
You want to tuck him in, or should I?

327
00:31:55,439 --> 00:31:59,447
Well... this... this meal looks lovely.

328
00:32:01,815 --> 00:32:03,104
Thank you.

329
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:17,164
I'm sorry.

330
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:27,103
I should have told you about her.

331
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:40,073
No more secrets.

332
00:32:41,157 --> 00:32:42,562
Okay?

333
00:32:53,302 --> 00:32:56,396
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

334
00:33:00,253 --> 00:33:02,776
I always loved watching him sleep.

335
00:33:07,212 --> 00:33:09,918
I take it you're setting out for
Candor in the morning?

336
00:33:10,132 --> 00:33:11,132
Yeah.

337
00:33:16,042 --> 00:33:19,862
Listen, I only want what's best for him.

338
00:33:21,914 --> 00:33:23,735
You hardly even know him.

339
00:33:26,106 --> 00:33:28,321
You'd like to think
that wouldn't you?

340
00:33:28,743 --> 00:33:32,262
But deep down, I think you're
scared I know him all to well.

341
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:37,412
- I'm not scared.
- Of course you are.

342
00:33:37,702 --> 00:33:41,779
You're scared he'll finally
see you for what you really are:

343
00:33:44,047 --> 00:33:45,921
deadly.

344
00:33:47,657 --> 00:33:49,377
You don't believe me?

345
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,015
Ask him.

346
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:03,598
You okay?

347
00:34:03,943 --> 00:34:04,943
Yeah.

348
00:34:07,158 --> 00:34:10,328
- You sure?
- Yeah.

349
00:34:59,572 --> 00:35:02,652
- I'm not going with you guys.
- What?

350
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:08,340
To Candor.
I'm not going with you guys.

351
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:14,440
- What are you talking about?
- What's your plan?

352
00:35:15,303 --> 00:35:17,852
You guys are going to find
the rest of the Dauntless, then what?

353
00:35:17,877 --> 00:35:19,524
You attack Erudite?

354
00:35:19,549 --> 00:35:21,759
Assassinate Jeanine, start a civil war?

355
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:26,375
I'm sorry, I'm just not cut out for that.

356
00:35:27,471 --> 00:35:29,022
I'm not like you guys.

357
00:35:33,766 --> 00:35:35,995
I need to go back to Abnegation, maybe...

358
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:39,421
sort out what our parents left behind...
At least I'll be useful there.

359
00:35:39,446 --> 00:35:42,351
Caleb, there's nothing left at Abnegation.

360
00:35:44,562 --> 00:35:45,681
Yeah.

361
00:36:19,158 --> 00:36:21,968
- You okay?
- We just need to get to Candor.

362
00:36:25,868 --> 00:36:26,908
Tris!

363
00:36:30,222 --> 00:36:34,760
I know you think Caleb is
your responsibility,
but he made his own choice.

364
00:36:36,113 --> 00:36:37,959
You can't protect everyone.

365
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,778
- I can't protect anyone.
- Nobody can.

366
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:48,297
Him leaving isn't your fault.
None of this is your fault.

367
00:36:50,426 --> 00:36:54,114
Johanna was right.
You have to forgive yourself.

368
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,135
Thank you.

369
00:37:02,338 --> 00:37:06,773
(Loudspeaker: All factions have been instructed
to maintain a strict curfew until further notice.)
- We've got to move.

370
00:37:07,075 --> 00:37:13,558
(Repeat. All factions have been
instructed to maintain a strict
curfew until further notice.)

371
00:37:32,595 --> 00:37:34,271
- We found them!
- Yeah.

372
00:37:34,492 --> 00:37:35,510
Four!

373
00:37:39,495 --> 00:37:40,863
Damn, is it good to see you guys.

374
00:37:40,888 --> 00:37:43,469
- How are you, Uriah?
- I'm better now. I'm not
exactly good for laying low.

375
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:45,244
- Tris!
- Christina!

376
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,798
- It's so good to see you.
- You too.

377
00:37:51,204 --> 00:37:53,494
Have you heard anything about Will?

378
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:58,478
- No.
- Nothing?

379
00:37:58,945 --> 00:37:59,945
No.

380
00:38:00,562 --> 00:38:02,640
Something must have happened to him.

381
00:38:03,518 --> 00:38:05,607
He would've found me by now, you know?

382
00:38:07,261 --> 00:38:09,072
- Hey!
- Hey.

383
00:38:09,953 --> 00:38:11,571
How are you holding up?

384
00:38:12,741 --> 00:38:15,097
- How many Dauntless do we have?
- 175 total.

385
00:38:15,122 --> 00:38:18,602
- 175? That's it?
- The rest followed Max.

386
00:38:18,627 --> 00:38:20,318
- Not near the numbers we need.
- No...

387
00:38:20,343 --> 00:38:23,419
Hold it! Drop your guns!

388
00:38:25,422 --> 00:38:28,181
- Woah! Hey, they're with us.
- We know who you are.

389
00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:31,285
Last warning. Drop your guns.

390
00:38:34,344 --> 00:38:35,753
Alright.

391
00:38:47,272 --> 00:38:48,689
Easy.

392
00:39:00,806 --> 00:39:04,320
- I'm Jack Kang, I'm leadership here.
- Yeah, we know who you are.

393
00:39:04,345 --> 00:39:06,029
We are not a threat to Candor.

394
00:39:06,339 --> 00:39:09,663
That might be your truth,
it's not necessarily mine.

395
00:39:09,845 --> 00:39:13,893
All I know for certain is:
you are both wanted for
criminal insurgency and conspiring

396
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:15,477
in the attack on Abnegation.

397
00:39:19,043 --> 00:39:20,426
Those are lies.

398
00:39:20,886 --> 00:39:23,425
If you were Candor,
I would take you at your word.

399
00:39:24,786 --> 00:39:28,992
Unfortunately given the circumstances,
I'm obliged to hand you over to the council.

400
00:39:29,017 --> 00:39:30,236
You can make your case there.

401
00:39:30,261 --> 00:39:34,945
You might as well just kill us now.
If Jeanine finds us, we're not going to live to stand trial.

402
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:37,955
I doubt that very much.
She would never supercede the council.

403
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:41,775
You sure about that?
Who's going to stop her? You?

404
00:39:43,651 --> 00:39:45,881
Factional law must be upheld.

405
00:39:46,177 --> 00:39:48,026
No, wait, wait, wait.

406
00:39:48,643 --> 00:39:49,976
Can I ask you one question?

407
00:39:51,469 --> 00:39:53,232
Can I ask you one question?

408
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:57,765
Jeanine believes that Erudite are most fit
to govern because they are the smartest.

409
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:01,435
Do you believe that Candor is most fit
to judge because you are so honest?

410
00:40:01,518 --> 00:40:04,383
I admit, I do hold that belief.

411
00:40:04,408 --> 00:40:06,558
Then, would you say that a trial
held here at Candor

412
00:40:06,583 --> 00:40:09,953
would be inherently more fair than
a trial held by Erudite?

413
00:40:14,086 --> 00:40:15,727
The answer is yes.

414
00:40:16,323 --> 00:40:18,713
In my opinion, a Candor trial
would have the greatest chance

415
00:40:18,738 --> 00:40:20,919
of achieving true justice.

416
00:40:20,943 --> 00:40:24,015
So you are asking me to petition a council
to grant Candor sole judiciary power?

417
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:28,492
No. As part of Candor's initiation,
you administer a truth serum...

418
00:40:28,517 --> 00:40:29,675
Correct?

419
00:40:31,685 --> 00:40:34,117
We don't typically discuss such matters
out of faction.

420
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:36,758
- That's a pretty evasive answer.
- Evasion is not dishonesty.

421
00:40:36,783 --> 00:40:38,614
But it's not exactly honesty, either.

422
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:44,277
- Yes, we possess such a serum.
- Then use it on us.

423
00:40:44,302 --> 00:40:45,111
Four!

424
00:40:45,136 --> 00:40:48,101
If we are guilty, we'll surrender
to the council, alright?

425
00:40:48,126 --> 00:40:51,628
If not, you've just saved two lives.

426
00:40:51,653 --> 00:40:54,676
- And made some loyal allies.
- Alright.

427
00:40:54,927 --> 00:40:57,623
But you should know that
the serum can be quite brutal.

428
00:40:57,755 --> 00:41:01,833
It was designed for Candor applicants, who
are already predisposed to honesty.

429
00:41:02,098 --> 00:41:04,690
Not everyone finds it so easy
to share their secrets.

430
00:41:06,566 --> 00:41:09,207
- I don't want to do this.
- We have to.

431
00:41:09,504 --> 00:41:12,665
Neither of us have secrets worth dying for.

432
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:24,031
May the truth set you free.

433
00:41:41,456 --> 00:41:42,506
Tobias Eaton.

434
00:41:46,488 --> 00:41:50,662
You are accused of conspiring
with your fellow Dauntless
in the attack on Abnegation.

435
00:41:51,355 --> 00:41:53,110
Is this true?

436
00:41:54,873 --> 00:41:56,448
Conspiring, no.

437
00:41:57,921 --> 00:41:59,535
But I did attack.

438
00:41:59,918 --> 00:42:01,943
I was in simulation controlled by Jeanine

439
00:42:01,968 --> 00:42:04,519
and the rest of the Dauntless
that she recruited.

440
00:42:05,192 --> 00:42:07,019
Tris found me.

441
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:10,983
She managed to break me free
from the simulation and together, we...

442
00:42:11,008 --> 00:42:13,708
together, fought our way out.

443
00:42:18,278 --> 00:42:22,259
So you are saying that Jeanine
orchestrated this attack?

444
00:42:23,997 --> 00:42:25,347
Yes.

445
00:42:29,198 --> 00:42:30,809
One last thing:

446
00:42:31,776 --> 00:42:35,111
if you suspected that
Jeanine had corrupted Dauntless,

447
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:37,153
why didn't you just leave?

448
00:42:38,676 --> 00:42:40,197
Why did you stay?

449
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:42,660
I wanted to leave.

450
00:42:43,903 --> 00:42:46,056
But I fell in love with Tris Prior.

451
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,854
And I could not leave her.

452
00:43:00,173 --> 00:43:02,330
Thank you for your Candor.

453
00:43:02,355 --> 00:43:04,312
Thank you for your Candor.

454
00:43:04,443 --> 00:43:06,866
Tobias Eaton, this trial
has concluded

455
00:43:06,891 --> 00:43:09,531
and you are absolved of guilt
in the attack on Abnegation.

456
00:43:12,384 --> 00:43:14,468
Miss Prior, if you would.

457
00:43:25,251 --> 00:43:27,029
May the truth set you free.

458
00:43:41,843 --> 00:43:43,108
Tris Prior.

459
00:43:44,785 --> 00:43:47,846
Mr. Eaton said you managed
to free him from the sim.

460
00:43:50,064 --> 00:43:51,391
Yes.

461
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,445
So you were never
under the simulation yourself.

462
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,167
No.

463
00:43:58,196 --> 00:43:59,735
How is that possible?

464
00:44:01,466 --> 00:44:03,925
Because I'm Divergent.
(Crowd gasps and whispers)

465
00:44:09,759 --> 00:44:11,421
I see.

466
00:44:14,187 --> 00:44:19,198
So you never harmed any of your fellow
Dauntless or the Abnegation?

467
00:44:20,701 --> 00:44:24,530
I did.

468
00:44:30,198 --> 00:44:31,335
Who?

469
00:44:33,889 --> 00:44:35,435
My mom.

470
00:44:37,025 --> 00:44:43,996
Um... I watched her die first
and then my dad.

471
00:44:44,021 --> 00:44:46,877
They were killed
trying to save me.

472
00:44:48,132 --> 00:44:51,157
And I...

473
00:44:54,531 --> 00:44:59,050
Miss Prior, the more you resist,
the more painful the serum will be.

474
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:11,490
My friend... I killed my friend.

475
00:45:11,515 --> 00:45:14,735
He was trying to shoot me. And I...

476
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,719
I shot him first.

477
00:45:27,008 --> 00:45:29,070
What was his name?

478
00:45:30,065 --> 00:45:31,380
I can't...

479
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:37,205
What was his name?

480
00:45:39,908 --> 00:45:41,501
Will!

481
00:45:43,973 --> 00:45:46,058
I killed Will.

482
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:52,575
This is what happens...

483
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:58,170
to people that get close to me.

484
00:46:06,339 --> 00:46:08,504
They get hurt or they die.

485
00:46:10,526 --> 00:46:13,067
I can't forgive myself.

486
00:46:16,161 --> 00:46:18,235
Thank you for your Candor.

487
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:20,334
Thank you for your Candor.

488
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:37,320
Tris!

489
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,819
Tris.

490
00:46:42,014 --> 00:46:44,740
I'm sorry, alright?

491
00:46:45,296 --> 00:46:48,306
- I told you that I didn't want to do that.
- I...

492
00:47:00,069 --> 00:47:01,679
- Christina.
- Go.

493
00:47:04,876 --> 00:47:06,202
Go.

494
00:47:14,949 --> 00:47:17,499
Abnegation sim complete.

495
00:47:19,023 --> 00:47:20,882
Dauntless sim initiating.

496
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:26,216
Ma'am, the Divergent's vitals are dropping.

497
00:47:26,241 --> 00:47:28,483
If we don't pull her out of
the sim soon, we'll loose her.

498
00:47:28,508 --> 00:47:30,715
You'll stop when I say so.

499
00:47:36,804 --> 00:47:38,856
She's going to do it.

500
00:47:42,313 --> 00:47:44,486
She's going to pass the sim.

501
00:47:47,809 --> 00:47:50,923
Dauntless sim failed.

502
00:47:51,825 --> 00:47:54,973
Divergent test subject six
is no longer viable.

503
00:47:57,723 --> 00:47:59,699
Alright, shut it down.

504
00:48:01,609 --> 00:48:03,075
Wasting our time...

505
00:48:05,123 --> 00:48:09,949
I've been assuming that all
Divergents are the same.

506
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:15,523
But some are much stronger than others.

507
00:48:17,077 --> 00:48:20,989
Assign all non-essential personnel
to the Divergent detail.

508
00:48:21,226 --> 00:48:23,371
We need to look harder.

509
00:48:23,396 --> 00:48:26,214
We need to find that very special one.

510
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:47,621
Where's your scary boyfriend?

511
00:48:51,077 --> 00:48:54,165
Probably off doing scary boyfriend things.

512
00:48:59,065 --> 00:49:00,751
Mind if I join you?

513
00:49:05,906 --> 00:49:07,352
I love heights.

514
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:12,575
From up here, it all just seems
so much smaller, you know?

515
00:49:13,856 --> 00:49:16,563
I know it sounds crazy, but...

516
00:49:16,697 --> 00:49:20,885
Sometimes I think I see lights...
out beyond the wall.

517
00:49:22,539 --> 00:49:26,847
I know they say it's all just...
wasteland out there, but...

518
00:49:28,414 --> 00:49:31,312
We can't be the only ones left.
Can we?

519
00:49:31,337 --> 00:49:32,974
(Gunfire flares up)

520
00:49:37,059 --> 00:49:38,844
Let's go!

521
00:49:39,023 --> 00:49:41,179
- Closest weapons?
- Rifle!

522
00:50:58,627 --> 00:51:00,928
Floor's clear, moving down!

523
00:51:28,701 --> 00:51:32,371
- Mommy? Mommy!
- Shh!

524
00:51:33,105 --> 00:51:36,505
- Shh!
- They hurt my mommy?

525
00:51:37,159 --> 00:51:38,787
Look, I got one too.

526
00:51:39,592 --> 00:51:41,287
See? It's okay.

527
00:51:42,173 --> 00:51:44,688
It's just the thing that
made everybody go to sleep.

528
00:51:45,084 --> 00:51:47,237
Okay, I need you
to do me a favor:

529
00:51:47,262 --> 00:51:49,216
I need you to go to the top
of those stairs over there

530
00:51:49,241 --> 00:51:51,458
and don't come down until
your mommy comes to get you.

531
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:55,148
- Don't come down.
- Don't come down. Can you do that?

532
00:51:56,303 --> 00:51:57,810
Be brave, okay?

533
00:51:58,722 --> 00:52:01,648
Okay. Go.

534
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:38,221
Hey!

535
00:52:38,926 --> 00:52:40,818
Why are we the only ones awake?

536
00:52:41,974 --> 00:52:43,793
Because we're Divergents.

537
00:52:44,175 --> 00:52:46,457
Come on, I need your help.
We have to open this.

538
00:52:46,482 --> 00:52:48,361
Uriah, I need your help.

539
00:52:54,098 --> 00:52:55,335
Hey!

540
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:59,223
Look who decided to show up.

541
00:53:05,082 --> 00:53:07,443
It's really good to see you again.

542
00:53:13,724 --> 00:53:17,588
Alright, folks,
nothing to be nervous about.

543
00:53:17,613 --> 00:53:21,951
Just a little routine inspection,
then we can all go back to our business.

544
00:53:23,822 --> 00:53:24,989
Hello.

545
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:31,883
Divergent, 10%.

546
00:53:32,225 --> 00:53:34,798
Huh. Shit.

547
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:37,802
You're almost normal.

548
00:53:38,422 --> 00:53:39,805
That's boring.

549
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:43,883
That is not part of the mission.

550
00:53:43,908 --> 00:53:45,302
So what?

551
00:53:46,209 --> 00:53:48,590
As far as I'm concerned,
the rest of them are still outlaws.

552
00:53:49,875 --> 00:53:54,252
Let's just wrap this up quickly.
The others are going to be awake soon.

553
00:54:05,719 --> 00:54:08,372
- Hi, Sweetie.
- I should not...

554
00:54:10,416 --> 00:54:14,213
- Divergent, 40%.
- I'm afraid it's not you either.

555
00:54:15,873 --> 00:54:18,451
The lady said that I should not...

556
00:54:18,835 --> 00:54:22,150
The lady said that I shouldn't
have come downstairs.

557
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,141
I guess you should have listened.

558
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:39,448
Enough!
We still have to test her. Eric!

559
00:54:40,404 --> 00:54:43,313
Jeanine told us that
we have to test everyone.

560
00:54:49,998 --> 00:54:54,330
- Divergent 100%.
- I'll be damned.

561
00:54:54,355 --> 00:54:57,230
- What?
- She's what we've been looking for.

562
00:54:57,255 --> 00:55:00,021
Bullshit.

563
00:55:03,299 --> 00:55:05,735
Divergent 100%.

564
00:55:08,659 --> 00:55:09,849
Get her in the vehicle.

565
00:55:10,328 --> 00:55:11,917
I'll alert Jeanine.

566
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:19,031
If you think you got lucky, you are wrong.

567
00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:22,520
You're going to wish I killed you.

568
00:55:37,645 --> 00:55:39,065
Drop your weapons!

569
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:40,231
Right there!

570
00:55:40,256 --> 00:55:41,412
Down where I can see them!

571
00:55:49,498 --> 00:55:50,808
Hey.

572
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:55,226
Thank you.

573
00:55:56,997 --> 00:55:59,105
It's lucky you got that gun, Four.

574
00:56:01,526 --> 00:56:04,923
We both know you're never much without one.

575
00:56:35,641 --> 00:56:39,409
You think she's safe now?
You're wrong.

576
00:56:40,449 --> 00:56:43,507
Jeanine's never going to stop
searching for you.

577
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:51,552
Why?
What does she want with her? Tell me!

578
00:56:51,949 --> 00:56:55,134
Look, all I know is she's
exactly what Jeanine needs.

579
00:56:55,159 --> 00:56:57,113
She's the perfect subject.

580
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:02,854
Was that supposed to scare me?

581
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:07,112
You're responsible for the
death of hundreds of people.

582
00:57:07,137 --> 00:57:09,187
You know the
punishment for that.

583
00:57:09,212 --> 00:57:14,904
Listen... I found a way to live
with the blood on my hands.

584
00:57:15,681 --> 00:57:17,969
But can you?

585
00:57:49,384 --> 00:57:50,994
Why won't they come out?

586
00:57:51,019 --> 00:57:53,959
All I know is it put me in
a sleeping sim and then I woke up
to all hell breaking loose.

587
00:57:53,984 --> 00:57:55,782
Hack, don't play with it!

588
00:58:06,098 --> 00:58:07,755
You all know what this means.

589
00:58:09,737 --> 00:58:11,097
Thank you.

590
00:58:11,136 --> 00:58:14,536
- For helping us.
- I wish I could do more.

591
00:58:15,048 --> 00:58:19,157
I had no idea Jeanine was capable
of something like this.

592
00:58:19,786 --> 00:58:21,146
It's time we fight back.

593
00:58:21,171 --> 00:58:23,539
- We don't have the numbers.
- We will.

594
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:26,378
Once we get to factionless.

595
00:58:31,059 --> 00:58:32,481
You heard Eric.

596
00:58:32,855 --> 00:58:37,241
Jeanine is never going to stop
coming after you.
It's our only option.

597
00:58:42,881 --> 00:58:46,539
Tris Prior. Of course.

598
00:58:47,198 --> 00:58:49,125
It had to be her.

599
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:52,564
- Is she still off the grid?
- Yeah.

600
00:58:53,051 --> 00:58:55,152
Yeah, but I think I found a solution.

601
00:58:59,365 --> 00:59:02,335
- It's Peter, right?
- Yeah.

602
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:07,030
And, Jeanine, can I just say it is truly
an honor to finally meet you in person.

603
00:59:07,651 --> 00:59:09,622
Congratulations, Mother.

604
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,622
You got your war.

605
00:59:12,845 --> 00:59:17,208
- I know you wish there was another way.
- But there isn't.

606
00:59:19,933 --> 00:59:22,162
I'm the lesser of two evils, is that it?

607
00:59:28,076 --> 00:59:31,545
- You'd better be.
- Tell me...

608
00:59:31,973 --> 00:59:34,350
Why did you surrender to Erudite?

609
00:59:35,886 --> 00:59:37,751
What do you want?

610
00:59:39,639 --> 00:59:42,908
I would like a position in your regime.

611
00:59:43,221 --> 00:59:47,553
Ideally, I would like a position with
some advancement opportunities.

612
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:50,920
I may be Dauntless,
but I'm not just some meathead.

613
00:59:52,397 --> 00:59:54,248
No offense, Max.

614
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:00,304
Prove your worth to us.

615
01:00:01,227 --> 01:00:03,200
Then we can discuss your ambitions.

616
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:05,386
Great.

617
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,581
When do I start?

618
01:00:07,606 --> 01:00:10,361
Let's talk about your friend, Tris Prior.

619
01:00:12,074 --> 01:00:14,906
- How do I flush her out?
- It's simple.

620
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:18,356
The girl is a walking bleeding heart.
She was born Abnegation.
That's her weak spot.

621
01:00:19,041 --> 01:00:20,553
You just have to know
how to press it.

622
01:00:20,578 --> 01:00:23,546
- Help! Come quick!
- It's coming from up there!

623
01:00:23,571 --> 01:00:26,517
Christina! Please, help!

624
01:00:27,234 --> 01:00:29,358
Somebody, do something!

625
01:00:30,706 --> 01:00:32,950
- Look! On the ledge!
- What are they doing?

626
01:00:33,516 --> 01:00:38,053
The traitor, Tris Prior,
must be surrendered to Erudite.

627
01:00:38,078 --> 01:00:41,473
Or every day more death will follow.

628
01:00:45,035 --> 01:00:48,715
- Go!
- Hand over Tris Prior.

629
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:50,865
Or every day more death will follow.

630
01:00:53,773 --> 01:00:56,341
Hand over Tris Prior.

631
01:00:56,366 --> 01:00:59,698
- Or every day more death will follow.
- Get them down!

632
01:01:00,565 --> 01:01:01,675
Hunter, no!

633
01:01:03,091 --> 01:01:05,277
Hand over Tris Prior.

634
01:01:05,302 --> 01:01:08,670
- Or every day more death will follow.
- Christina!

635
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,325
No!

636
01:01:20,633 --> 01:01:23,627
Christina... Christina!

637
01:01:24,875 --> 01:01:26,663
Tris, help me!

638
01:01:27,526 --> 01:01:28,908
Tris!

639
01:02:04,655 --> 01:02:07,327
We removed this from
the body of the suicide.

640
01:02:07,588 --> 01:02:11,756
Marlene. Her name was Marlene.

641
01:02:12,034 --> 01:02:14,740
I'm sorry. Marlene.

642
01:02:15,585 --> 01:02:18,197
It's a very sophisticated
sim serum injector.

643
01:02:18,222 --> 01:02:20,695
It also has a radio transmitter
in its head.

644
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:23,655
- How do we get them out?
- I don't know.

645
01:02:24,023 --> 01:02:26,542
This tech was built to defend itself.

646
01:02:26,567 --> 01:02:27,651
This tendril...

647
01:02:28,505 --> 01:02:30,477
wraps around the nearest major artery.

648
01:02:30,978 --> 01:02:34,900
Try to remove them and...
they kill the host.

649
01:02:34,925 --> 01:02:37,467
(Indistinct, worried chatter)

650
01:02:38,978 --> 01:02:40,612
- That's insane!
- So what do we do?

651
01:02:40,637 --> 01:02:43,746
Tori has to find a way to neutralize the
disks before we do anything else.

652
01:02:43,771 --> 01:02:45,877
Or we could do the logical thing.

653
01:02:46,698 --> 01:02:48,313
And we hand her over.

654
01:02:48,338 --> 01:02:52,097
Nobody knows about this alliance:
we have to protect that advantage.

655
01:02:52,122 --> 01:02:54,699
If we hand Tris over now,

656
01:02:55,007 --> 01:02:57,194
it might buy us some time!

657
01:02:57,219 --> 01:03:01,597
(The factionless
raise their voices in agreement)

658
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:08,022
- I think it's a good idea.
- Get rid of her!

659
01:03:08,047 --> 01:03:09,308
Damn right.

660
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:11,065
Except you'll have to go through me first.

661
01:03:11,507 --> 01:03:14,138
- Me too.
- And all of us!

662
01:03:14,163 --> 01:03:17,447
(The Dauntless rally behind Four)

663
01:03:24,876 --> 01:03:29,633
Hey, hey! I ain't the one with
the time bomb in my arm!

664
01:03:30,331 --> 01:03:32,747
- Yeah, kick them out!
- You've got to go!

665
01:03:59,422 --> 01:04:01,285
I know what you're thinking...

666
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:05,573
But I'm not going to let you do it.

667
01:04:13,137 --> 01:04:15,828
I can't let anyone else die because of me.

668
01:04:15,853 --> 01:04:17,657
No one else is going to die because of you.

669
01:04:18,094 --> 01:04:20,490
Tori's going to find a way to
disable the disks.

670
01:04:20,515 --> 01:04:23,277
- And if she doesn't?
- Then...

671
01:04:26,017 --> 01:04:29,830
Then if she doesn't, we figure it out.

672
01:04:31,099 --> 01:04:32,201
Together.

673
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:35,322
You know, I'm just one person.

674
01:04:38,354 --> 01:04:40,970
- I'm not worth it.
- You are worth it.

675
01:04:41,534 --> 01:04:43,484
You are more than worth it to me.

676
01:04:44,898 --> 01:04:46,578
I love you.

677
01:06:50,629 --> 01:06:56,691
(Jeanine via loudspeaker:
... maintaining the social order.
But this harmony we've achieved is now under attack.)

678
01:06:56,716 --> 01:07:06,589
(This city may be safely enclosed behind
a vast wall, but make no mistake:
that wall alone does not ensure our security.)

679
01:07:07,318 --> 01:07:15,325
(It's up to us, every one of us,
to remain vigilant in identifying and isolating
any potential threat to our stability.)

680
01:07:15,643 --> 01:07:20,159
(There are individuals hiding among
us who must be contained.)

681
01:07:20,184 --> 01:07:24,364
(So permit me to address the objections from
my fellow faction leaders. )

682
01:07:25,546 --> 01:07:30,476
(I am aware that there have been some
concerns about the unavoidable raid on Candor.)

683
01:07:30,887 --> 01:07:33,039
(So let me be clear:)

684
01:07:34,146 --> 01:07:37,473
(The harbouring of Divergents
by any faction)

685
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:40,836
(can not be tolerated.)

686
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:44,220
(Very soon, I will be presenting
what I believe to be)

687
01:07:44,245 --> 01:07:48,187
(no less than a mandate from
the Founders themselves.)

688
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:53,725
(And this will, I have no doubt,
validate the measures
I am taking to keep the peace)

689
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:58,616
(and provide the instructions that
will allow us to eradicate
the Divergent crisis.)

690
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:00,900
(Once and for all.)

691
01:08:15,455 --> 01:08:16,985
Where are you going?

692
01:08:18,148 --> 01:08:19,787
Tris left. She's gone.

693
01:08:21,015 --> 01:08:23,304
What? When?

694
01:08:24,268 --> 01:08:26,215
- Last night.
- Wait.

695
01:08:29,849 --> 01:08:33,168
Tobias! People look to you for leadership.

696
01:08:33,505 --> 01:08:35,755
You can't just abandon them.

697
01:08:40,132 --> 01:08:41,247
Tobias!

698
01:08:51,416 --> 01:08:52,466
Wow!

699
01:08:54,779 --> 01:08:56,697
I have to admit, I'm impressed.

700
01:08:57,568 --> 01:09:00,221
I mean, I knew that you were dumb, but...

701
01:09:00,246 --> 01:09:03,457
I didn't think you were dumb enough
to actually come down here...

702
01:09:03,482 --> 01:09:05,041
and turn yourself in.

703
01:09:10,889 --> 01:09:12,371
The killings have to stop.

704
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:17,127
Well, that just shows that you can
take the girl out of Abnegation

705
01:09:17,152 --> 01:09:19,556
but you can't take the Abnegation
out of the girl.

706
01:09:19,581 --> 01:09:20,995
Let's go.

707
01:09:22,298 --> 01:09:24,797
Once a stiff, always a stiff. Right?

708
01:09:35,715 --> 01:09:39,814
- What is this?
- What is this? This is the only
reason why you're alive, Tris.

709
01:09:40,013 --> 01:09:43,073
Man, I love knowing stuff
that you don't.

710
01:09:44,182 --> 01:09:46,528
I need you to open up that box, Tris.

711
01:09:51,889 --> 01:09:56,205
The only way to open that box is to
pass the sims of all five factions.

712
01:09:57,367 --> 01:10:01,347
But the only people that have
tried to do it so far have died.

713
01:10:02,133 --> 01:10:05,927
Oops. I don't think
I was supposed to tell you that.

714
01:10:06,679 --> 01:10:07,786
Oh well...

715
01:10:09,207 --> 01:10:10,572
No pressure.

716
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:12,690
Remarkable!

717
01:10:14,342 --> 01:10:18,177
The chances of it being you, of all people.

718
01:10:19,007 --> 01:10:21,477
Nearly defies the laws of probability.

719
01:10:25,063 --> 01:10:28,548
As remarkable as the amount of people
you've managed to murder.

720
01:10:30,147 --> 01:10:33,689
Dark times call for extreme measures.

721
01:10:35,012 --> 01:10:37,320
You may find it hard to believe.

722
01:10:37,615 --> 01:10:40,154
But I am serving the greater good.

723
01:10:42,904 --> 01:10:45,268
Step up on the disk, please.

724
01:11:03,953 --> 01:11:05,037
(Peter cocks his gun)

725
01:11:06,131 --> 01:11:08,410
Step up on the disk, please.

726
01:11:15,978 --> 01:11:17,195
Ma'am?

727
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:19,286
Hmm?

728
01:11:24,555 --> 01:11:25,573
Oh.

729
01:11:26,052 --> 01:11:29,338
Stop the suicides or I
swear I will shoot him.

730
01:11:29,736 --> 01:11:34,205
That's okay. You can kill him if you want,
we have plenty of guards.

731
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:36,792
What?

732
01:12:14,875 --> 01:12:20,645
I'm guessing you need me alive
for this to work. Right?

733
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:25,105
Right?

734
01:12:37,144 --> 01:12:38,924
Beatrice.

735
01:12:41,961 --> 01:12:43,221
Caleb.

736
01:12:45,237 --> 01:12:46,610
Caleb.

737
01:12:48,101 --> 01:12:51,333
Don't engage the subject.

738
01:12:52,063 --> 01:12:54,928
Conditions are already less then optimal.

739
01:13:02,877 --> 01:13:03,977
Oh, my God.

740
01:13:15,603 --> 01:13:18,454
If I do this, the suicides stop.

741
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:21,682
No.

742
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:24,456
The suicides will continue.

743
01:13:24,722 --> 01:13:28,609
Until you succeed and pass all five sims.

744
01:13:29,638 --> 01:13:32,981
That should be incentive enough.

745
01:13:35,475 --> 01:13:36,685
Good luck.

746
01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:50,071
Let's begin.

747
01:14:51,494 --> 01:14:53,884
Initializing Dauntless sim.

748
01:15:13,239 --> 01:15:14,512
Mom.

749
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:20,863
Tris, help me!

750
01:15:21,704 --> 01:15:22,722
Mom!

751
01:15:25,651 --> 01:15:27,673
- Tris!
- Mom!

752
01:15:51,701 --> 01:15:53,511
Her heart rate is rising.

753
01:15:54,471 --> 01:15:55,979
Keep her in play.

754
01:16:15,624 --> 01:16:16,814
Mom!

755
01:16:26,689 --> 01:16:28,933
- Tris!
- I'm coming.

756
01:17:03,650 --> 01:17:05,616
Mom!

757
01:17:10,028 --> 01:17:11,528
I'm coming.

758
01:17:57,014 --> 01:17:58,386
Tris! Help me!

759
01:17:59,588 --> 01:18:01,145
Hold on!

760
01:18:11,856 --> 01:18:13,199
Tris.

761
01:18:14,549 --> 01:18:17,697
Dauntless sim complete.

762
01:18:28,068 --> 01:18:29,323
Mom.

763
01:18:31,861 --> 01:18:33,331
I miss you so much.

764
01:18:33,965 --> 01:18:35,818
I know you do.

765
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,586
But I'm still with you.

766
01:18:49,798 --> 01:18:51,759
You need to be strong now.

767
01:18:52,855 --> 01:18:55,002
Tell me you're going to be strong.

768
01:18:55,259 --> 01:18:57,898
- I'm trying.
- You can do this.

769
01:18:58,090 --> 01:18:59,525
I know you can.

770
01:19:00,151 --> 01:19:01,968
You're brave.

771
01:19:02,430 --> 01:19:04,474
Braver than anyone.

772
01:19:05,932 --> 01:19:07,540
I'm not brave, mom.

773
01:19:10,748 --> 01:19:12,777
I pretend that I am.

774
01:19:14,404 --> 01:19:17,273
And I want people to think
that I am, but I'm not.

775
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:23,994
I'm really, really scared.

776
01:19:24,831 --> 01:19:28,063
That maybe we are actually what's
wrong in this world.

777
01:19:29,346 --> 01:19:30,779
Divergents.

778
01:19:32,846 --> 01:19:34,764
I never wanted any of this.

779
01:19:36,199 --> 01:19:39,802
You, and dad, and Caleb, and then Four.

780
01:19:40,337 --> 01:19:47,496
I can't help but think that
if I was normal, we would
all still be together.

781
01:19:48,426 --> 01:19:51,368
Mom, I don't want to be Divergent anymore.

782
01:19:52,463 --> 01:19:54,842
I just want to feel safe again.

783
01:19:57,538 --> 01:19:59,812
Candor sim complete.

784
01:20:19,694 --> 01:20:22,094
Four. You're here?

785
01:20:22,119 --> 01:20:24,485
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You're here.

786
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,196
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

787
01:20:29,853 --> 01:20:31,363
Secure the hallway.

788
01:20:34,107 --> 01:20:36,182
Okay, let's get you out of here.

789
01:20:38,117 --> 01:20:39,972
- You good?
- Yeah.

790
01:20:53,757 --> 01:20:56,266
Stop. Let him go.

791
01:20:56,675 --> 01:20:58,573
Wait, you're not going to shoot me?

792
01:20:59,219 --> 01:21:01,347
Once a stiff, always a stiff.

793
01:21:14,142 --> 01:21:15,217
Go!

794
01:21:22,102 --> 01:21:24,570
Four, how did you get past security?

795
01:21:24,625 --> 01:21:27,268
You know me: scary boyfriend skills.

796
01:21:32,148 --> 01:21:33,351
What is it?

797
01:21:36,146 --> 01:21:39,324
You weren't there.
You didn't even hear that.

798
01:21:43,685 --> 01:21:45,777
Tris. We need to leave now.
Alright?

799
01:21:46,747 --> 01:21:48,227
I'm sorry, Four.

800
01:21:49,035 --> 01:21:52,130
- What?
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you
that I was going to go.

801
01:21:53,527 --> 01:21:56,489
I wanted to say goodbye,
and I just didn't know how.

802
01:21:56,514 --> 01:21:58,026
I didn't know how.

803
01:21:58,051 --> 01:21:59,832
What are you talking about?

804
01:22:03,534 --> 01:22:06,083
So even though I didn't get to
say it in real life,

805
01:22:07,337 --> 01:22:09,126
at least I get to say it now.

806
01:22:10,233 --> 01:22:14,361
- Even if it is just in a sim.
- Tris, we're not in a sim.

807
01:22:15,207 --> 01:22:17,304
Don't you think I would
know if I was in a sim?

808
01:22:17,593 --> 01:22:21,703
Four... you're not in a sim.

809
01:22:24,142 --> 01:22:28,431
- You are the sim.
- Wait, wait.

810
01:22:59,695 --> 01:23:02,338
Erudite sim complete.

811
01:23:03,343 --> 01:23:05,100
There's only Amity now.

812
01:23:05,353 --> 01:23:07,027
She hasn't passed
Abnegation yet.

813
01:23:07,052 --> 01:23:10,545
Yes, she has. When she spared your life.

814
01:23:12,112 --> 01:23:14,199
This girl is extraordinary.

815
01:23:14,828 --> 01:23:17,994
She's tested positive for
four factions in one day.

816
01:23:20,334 --> 01:23:22,954
No one has gotten that far.

817
01:23:23,835 --> 01:23:25,697
We've got a problem.

818
01:23:30,494 --> 01:23:33,085
She's crashing. We have to rest her.

819
01:23:33,672 --> 01:23:36,708
Sure you're not letting familial
attachment cloud your judgement?

820
01:23:36,995 --> 01:23:38,342
See for yourself.

821
01:23:46,661 --> 01:23:48,161
Very well.

822
01:23:49,683 --> 01:23:51,269
Detach the subject.

823
01:24:02,956 --> 01:24:06,612
Good work, everyone.
We will resume tomorrow.

824
01:24:48,824 --> 01:24:52,190
You were never planing on going
back to Abnegation, were you?

825
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:56,930
I had to do what I thought was right.

826
01:24:57,809 --> 01:25:00,142
Our parents would be ashamed of you.

827
01:25:01,081 --> 01:25:02,868
Well maybe not.

828
01:25:04,701 --> 01:25:07,167
I mean, I am willing
to sacrifice you.

829
01:25:07,850 --> 01:25:10,483
The only family I have left.
The only person I love.

830
01:25:10,508 --> 01:25:13,375
In order to preserve what's
best for everyone else.

831
01:25:15,530 --> 01:25:17,506
What's more selfless than that?

832
01:25:26,069 --> 01:25:28,933
What does Jeanine think
is in that box, Caleb?

833
01:25:29,457 --> 01:25:31,188
It's a message from the Founders.

834
01:25:31,213 --> 01:25:35,137
But the box was to be opened
only if the faction system broke down.

835
01:25:35,162 --> 01:25:38,237
Which is why it requires
someone like you to open it.

836
01:25:38,923 --> 01:25:41,132
You are living proof
that the Divergent problem

837
01:25:41,157 --> 01:25:43,598
has grown beyond all control.

838
01:25:44,256 --> 01:25:46,734
Do you even hear what you
are saying right now?

839
01:25:47,977 --> 01:25:50,510
No one thinks it's your fault
that you were born this way.

840
01:25:50,535 --> 01:25:52,833
Jeanine murdered
an entire faction, Caleb.

841
01:25:52,925 --> 01:25:55,284
That faction could no longer be trusted.

842
01:25:55,330 --> 01:25:56,614
She killed our parents.

843
01:25:56,772 --> 01:25:58,957
Our parents brought that on themselves.

844
01:25:59,181 --> 01:26:00,650
What are you talking about?

845
01:26:01,887 --> 01:26:04,269
The box. It was in their house.

846
01:26:04,294 --> 01:26:05,804
They were the ones hiding it.

847
01:26:05,829 --> 01:26:08,106
All those lives could have been spared.

848
01:26:10,094 --> 01:26:13,137
Seems we didn't knew our parents
as well as we thought we did.

849
01:26:15,567 --> 01:26:18,839
Alright. Family reunion is over,
it's time to go.

850
01:26:26,131 --> 01:26:28,483
I got a little surprise for you, Tris.

851
01:26:32,328 --> 01:26:34,120
- Four!
- Tris!

852
01:26:34,655 --> 01:26:36,387
- Tris!
- Four! Four!

853
01:26:37,733 --> 01:26:40,486
- Tris!
- Four! Four!

854
01:26:41,729 --> 01:26:44,093
Four! Four!

855
01:26:51,528 --> 01:26:56,803
I gather your brother explained to you
how vital the work you're doing here is
to the future of the city.

856
01:26:56,828 --> 01:26:58,587
Please, just let Four go.

857
01:26:59,749 --> 01:27:05,594
If his well-being is of such
concern, then you should focus
on the task at hand.

858
01:27:07,326 --> 01:27:10,273
Tell me... Do you appreciate irony?

859
01:27:11,633 --> 01:27:15,937
You tested positive for Erudite,
so you must have the
intellectual capacity.

860
01:27:15,962 --> 01:27:17,138
Irony?

861
01:27:17,163 --> 01:27:19,468
For instance, right now you are
filled with hate,

862
01:27:19,926 --> 01:27:22,099
 but you need to pass an Amity sim.

863
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:29,586
Then there are other ironies at work too.

864
01:27:29,611 --> 01:27:31,919
- Such as the fact your cherished mother...
- Don't.

865
01:27:31,944 --> 01:27:34,363
who you so dauntlessly saved in the sim

866
01:27:34,388 --> 01:27:35,915
is the reason you're in
this mess to begin with.

867
01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:37,555
You are the reason I'm in this mess.

868
01:27:37,580 --> 01:27:40,647
- And then there the most
poignant irony of all...
- Stop.

869
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:43,993
That Nathalie Prior not only died
trying to protect the data

870
01:27:44,018 --> 01:27:46,635
- that I now have in my possession.
- Because you stole it from her.

871
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:47,607
You killed her for it!

872
01:27:47,632 --> 01:27:50,404
Data that she so
selfishly withheld.

873
01:27:50,429 --> 01:27:54,076
But her own daughter,
her beloved Divergent, Tris,

874
01:27:54,101 --> 01:27:55,789
is going to be the one
to deliver it to me.

875
01:27:55,814 --> 01:27:58,106
- I said stop!
- Therefore...

876
01:27:58,641 --> 01:28:02,600
your mother's death, just like
your boyfriend's death....

877
01:28:02,914 --> 01:28:05,665
will mean absolutely nothing.

878
01:29:13,603 --> 01:29:18,051
Don't pull her out. Not yet.

879
01:30:07,742 --> 01:30:10,862
No! No!

880
01:30:12,847 --> 01:30:14,051
Bring her back!

881
01:30:14,696 --> 01:30:19,029
Bring... Bring her back!

882
01:30:19,572 --> 01:30:21,117
Now!

883
01:30:21,803 --> 01:30:23,554
Bring her back!

884
01:30:23,579 --> 01:30:24,978
Come on!

885
01:30:25,149 --> 01:30:27,738
Come on! Come on!

886
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:31,486
Bring her back!

887
01:30:31,511 --> 01:30:34,372
Test subject seven
is no longer viable.

888
01:30:58,189 --> 01:31:00,820
I really thought you were the one.

889
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:13,460
We'll just...

890
01:31:16,883 --> 01:31:20,412
We'll just have to resume our search.

891
01:31:35,153 --> 01:31:37,651
Find solace in your faction, Caleb.

892
01:31:38,084 --> 01:31:39,992
We are your family now.

893
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:28,400
Jeanine wanted me to show you this.

894
01:32:58,250 --> 01:33:00,901
Hey, Four, maybe do that thing you do?

895
01:33:06,754 --> 01:33:09,044
Hey, Four, come on.
That was pretty good, right?

896
01:33:09,069 --> 01:33:11,432
First, I swiped a paralytic
from the infirmary.

897
01:33:11,457 --> 01:33:13,827
Then I shot her up when she was
all freaking out about you.

898
01:33:14,474 --> 01:33:16,290
I mean, I told these guys
I was pretty smart.

899
01:33:16,315 --> 01:33:17,881
Guess they should have listened.

900
01:33:23,305 --> 01:33:26,992
- You're real!
- Yeah, I'm real.

901
01:33:29,261 --> 01:33:30,844
What are you doing here?

902
01:33:32,749 --> 01:33:34,060
You die, I die.

903
01:33:37,180 --> 01:33:40,402
Oh... Okay, guys. Come on.
Let's go, seriously.

904
01:33:40,427 --> 01:33:41,840
We can... do that later.

905
01:33:42,871 --> 01:33:44,345
- You okay?
- Yeah.

906
01:33:48,676 --> 01:33:51,346
- Thank you, Peter.
- Yeah, whatever.
Now we're even, Stiff.

907
01:33:52,033 --> 01:33:53,907
Alright, come on. Let's go.

908
01:33:54,298 --> 01:33:56,338
- Before Jeanine realizes
you're still alive.
- No, no, no.

909
01:33:56,363 --> 01:33:58,516
- What?
- The box! We have to get the box!

910
01:33:58,541 --> 01:34:00,866
Are you kidding me?
Now is not the time for
a souvenir, Tris!

911
01:34:00,891 --> 01:34:02,462
Four, you have to listen to me.

912
01:34:02,487 --> 01:34:06,450
It's not what Jeanine thinks it is,
I know it's not.
My mother would have destroyed it.

913
01:34:06,794 --> 01:34:08,192
We have to get it.

914
01:34:11,812 --> 01:34:14,239
Peter, is there another way into the lab?

915
01:34:14,264 --> 01:34:17,244
I mean, I'd have into go
into the control room to
disable all the doors.

916
01:34:17,269 --> 01:34:18,685
Okay, good.
Then do that.

917
01:34:21,533 --> 01:34:23,383
- Okay, right now?
- Yeah.

918
01:34:23,408 --> 01:34:25,668
You just chose our side,
whether you meant to or not.

919
01:34:25,693 --> 01:34:28,141
If you want to survive, make sure we do.

920
01:34:29,097 --> 01:34:30,137
Let's go!

921
01:34:32,781 --> 01:34:33,865
Fuck!

922
01:35:02,693 --> 01:35:05,612
No guns. It'll draw too much attention.

923
01:35:07,617 --> 01:35:09,663
- Hey.
- Hold up!

924
01:35:19,712 --> 01:35:22,002
- Access denied.
- Come on!

925
01:35:49,606 --> 01:35:51,839
- Access granted.
- Alright, let's go.

926
01:35:52,732 --> 01:35:55,924
- Come on. Is that it?
- Yes.

927
01:35:55,949 --> 01:35:57,742
Alright, grab it and let's go.

928
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:04,625
- Security breach.
Security breach. Lock down.
- What's going on?

929
01:36:06,858 --> 01:36:09,802
- What's going on? What is it?
- There's been a breach
in the sim room, but...

930
01:36:09,827 --> 01:36:12,367
Get me a remote feed.
I want to see
who the hell is in there.

931
01:36:12,392 --> 01:36:15,229
- The cameras are down in the sector, too.
- I'll send the guards there now. Let's go.

932
01:36:15,254 --> 01:36:16,886
Bring up every cell!

933
01:36:16,977 --> 01:36:18,118
Now!

934
01:36:25,279 --> 01:36:26,377
Show her.

935
01:36:26,867 --> 01:36:28,978
Tori finally found a way
to get them out safely.

936
01:36:29,068 --> 01:36:32,366
- How many others?
- Every last one of them.

937
01:36:36,109 --> 01:36:37,185
Let's go!

938
01:36:40,956 --> 01:36:44,358
Tris! Tris, come on,
we've got to move.

939
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:47,500
Tris, we have to move!

940
01:36:48,682 --> 01:36:51,191
I can't! I can't!

941
01:36:51,216 --> 01:36:54,184
My mom died protecting
whatever is inside this.

942
01:36:55,743 --> 01:36:58,022
I have to open it for her
and I think I know how.

943
01:36:58,047 --> 01:37:01,992
- Tris, if we don't leave now,
we're not going to get out of here.
- I have to do this first.

944
01:37:02,017 --> 01:37:04,733
I know it doesn't make any sense
but you have to trust me, please.

945
01:37:06,927 --> 01:37:08,720
You have my life, apparently.

946
01:37:15,077 --> 01:37:16,491
Do it.

947
01:37:21,079 --> 01:37:22,153
Don't move!

948
01:37:27,427 --> 01:37:29,697
Initializing Amity sim.

949
01:37:34,250 --> 01:37:35,955
Back again, are we?

950
01:37:37,210 --> 01:37:39,604
You're an even bigger fool
than your mother.

951
01:37:44,228 --> 01:37:46,770
Say whatever you want to me, Jeanine.

952
01:37:47,498 --> 01:37:49,212
But I'm not going to fight you.

953
01:37:49,993 --> 01:37:53,191
- How very Amity of you.
- I mean it.

954
01:37:54,672 --> 01:37:58,248
- I'm not going to fight you.
- Of course you're not.

955
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:01,399
You're going to fight her.

956
01:38:03,896 --> 01:38:05,752
The one you really hate.

957
01:38:37,945 --> 01:38:39,546
What are you?

958
01:38:42,945 --> 01:38:44,657
I'm you, Tris.

959
01:38:45,898 --> 01:38:48,092
I'm the real you.

960
01:38:58,184 --> 01:38:59,356
I'm not going to fight you.

961
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:02,539
- I'll make you fight me.
- You're not me.

962
01:39:02,564 --> 01:39:05,697
I am. I'm what they see
when they look at you.

963
01:39:21,682 --> 01:39:25,567
You killed Will... and your parents.
You're deadly.

964
01:39:26,302 --> 01:39:27,417
That's enough!

965
01:39:31,509 --> 01:39:35,434
No one's going to love you, Tris.
They're never even going to miss you.

966
01:39:35,459 --> 01:39:37,714
This world will be
better off without you.

967
01:39:38,108 --> 01:39:40,748
One less Divergent ruining everything.

968
01:39:41,223 --> 01:39:46,907
And no one will ever, ever
forgive you for what you've done.

969
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:48,793
You're wrong.

970
01:39:58,358 --> 01:40:01,627
Because I will.

971
01:40:36,859 --> 01:40:39,244
Amity sim complete.

972
01:40:43,182 --> 01:40:45,220
- Wait!
- No! Stop!

973
01:40:48,743 --> 01:40:51,334
Initializing message.

974
01:41:10,134 --> 01:41:11,324
Hello.

975
01:41:12,227 --> 01:41:14,424
I come from outside the wall.

976
01:41:14,449 --> 01:41:17,894
Where we have all but destroyed each other.

977
01:41:18,917 --> 01:41:21,300
We designed your city
as an experiment.

978
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:25,287
We believe it is the only way
to recover the humanity
we have lost.

979
01:41:29,184 --> 01:41:32,403
And we created factions to ensure peace.

980
01:41:33,422 --> 01:41:37,377
But we believe there will be
those among you who
will transcend these factions.

981
01:41:39,608 --> 01:41:42,244
These will be the Divergent.

982
01:41:43,722 --> 01:41:46,768
They are the true purpose
of this experiment.

983
01:41:46,793 --> 01:41:49,822
They are vital to humanity's survival.

984
01:41:52,668 --> 01:41:56,088
If you're watching this now,
then at least one of you is proof

985
01:41:56,113 --> 01:41:58,580
that our experiment
has succeeded.

986
01:41:59,990 --> 01:42:05,931
The time has come for you to emerge
from your isolation and rejoin us.

987
01:42:05,956 --> 01:42:08,881
We have allowed you to believe
that you're the last of us,

988
01:42:09,180 --> 01:42:10,969
but you're not.

989
01:42:11,431 --> 01:42:16,191
Mankind waits for you, with hope,

990
01:42:17,062 --> 01:42:19,389
beyond the wall.

991
01:42:26,127 --> 01:42:27,430
You okay?

992
01:42:27,771 --> 01:42:29,162
Yeah.

993
01:42:32,336 --> 01:42:33,436
Yes.

994
01:42:51,107 --> 01:42:54,448
You were wrong about us.

995
01:42:57,750 --> 01:43:03,011
We were never the problem.
We're the solution.

996
01:43:15,219 --> 01:43:17,692
- Bury the box.
- What?

997
01:43:17,716 --> 01:43:20,538
No one sees it.
Ever.

998
01:43:23,947 --> 01:43:25,396
Kill them both.

999
01:43:25,857 --> 01:43:26,994
No!

1000
01:43:34,239 --> 01:43:35,399
Don't move.

1001
01:43:38,881 --> 01:43:41,380
Down!
Put your weapons down now!

1002
01:43:42,314 --> 01:43:43,783
Stay!

1003
01:43:44,008 --> 01:43:46,798
- Put it down!
- Do not move!

1004
01:43:50,148 --> 01:43:51,699
Hello, Jeanine.

1005
01:43:53,297 --> 01:43:54,845
Evelyn?

1006
01:43:54,870 --> 01:43:56,298
Impressive.

1007
01:43:57,091 --> 01:43:59,095
I think we're going to like it here.

1008
01:43:59,465 --> 01:44:02,577
Do you honestly think the other
factions will stand for this?

1009
01:44:02,901 --> 01:44:04,910
Because you're so popular?

1010
01:44:07,659 --> 01:44:09,209
Get her out of here.

1011
01:44:10,544 --> 01:44:12,435
When that message gets out,

1012
01:44:12,460 --> 01:44:14,665
it will be the end.

1013
01:44:31,765 --> 01:44:33,485
What message?

1014
01:44:36,845 --> 01:44:38,430
You'll see.

1015
01:44:38,774 --> 01:44:41,461
I'm going to put it on
every monitor in the city.

1016
01:44:43,518 --> 01:44:46,862
(Founder via loudspeaker:
We have separated you
from the rest of us.)

1017
01:44:48,172 --> 01:44:51,942
(And we created factions to ensure peace.)

1018
01:44:53,459 --> 01:44:58,357
(The time has come for you to emerge
from your isolation and rejoin us.)

1019
01:44:58,907 --> 01:45:02,686
(We have allowed you to believe
that you're the last of us,)

1020
01:45:03,015 --> 01:45:04,489
(but you're not.)

1021
01:45:05,023 --> 01:45:08,364
(If you're watching this now,
then at least one of you is proof)

1022
01:45:08,389 --> 01:45:11,176
(that our experiment
has succeeded.)

1023
01:45:13,757 --> 01:45:17,651
(Mankind waits for you,
with hope,)

1024
01:45:18,783 --> 01:45:21,239
(beyond the wall.)

1025
01:45:57,736 --> 01:46:00,058
These will be the Divergent.

1026
01:46:00,213 --> 01:46:02,931
They are the true purpose
of this experiment.

1027
01:46:02,956 --> 01:46:06,179
They are vital
to humanity's survival.

1028
01:46:06,581 --> 01:46:08,219
You did it.

1029
01:46:09,182 --> 01:46:10,430
Yeah.

1030
01:46:16,823 --> 01:46:19,122
Everyone's staring at me.

1031
01:46:19,491 --> 01:46:21,301
You changed everything.

1032
01:46:23,164 --> 01:46:24,562
What now?

1033
01:46:25,633 --> 01:46:27,403
Only one way to find out.

1034
01:46:28,988 --> 01:46:30,447
You ready?

1035
01:47:34,542 --> 01:47:36,716
It's been over 200 years.

1036
01:47:39,669 --> 01:47:41,274
Who knows what's out there?

1037
01:47:44,178 --> 01:47:46,710
You'll never find out.
