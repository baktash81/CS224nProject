1
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,800
SUNSHINE THROUGH THE RAIN

2
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,600
You're staying home.

3
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,200
The sun is shining, but it's raining.

4
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,400
Foxes hold their wedding
processions in this weather.

5
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,600
And they don't like
anyone to see them.

6
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,900
lf you do,
they'll be very angry.

7
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,200
You went and saw...

8
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,400
... something you shouldn't have.

9
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,300
l can't let you in now.

10
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,700
An angry fox came looking for you.

11
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,200
He left this.

12
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,300
You're supposed to kill yourself.

13
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,900
Go quickly and ask
their forgiveness.

14
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,900
Give the knife back and tell them
how sorry you are.

15
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,200
They don't usually forgive.

16
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,300
You must be ready to die.

17
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,300
Get going.

18
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,400
Unless they forgive you,
l can't let you in.

19
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,200
But l don't know where they live.

20
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,100
You'll find out.

21
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,200
On days like this
there are always rainbows.

22
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,100
Foxes live under the rainbows.

23
00:17:32,747 --> 00:17:36,747
THE PEACH ORCHARD

24
00:18:06,847 --> 00:18:08,347
Take this, big sister.

25
00:18:08,347 --> 00:18:09,547
Thanks.

26
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:36,847
Weren't there six of you?

27
00:18:36,847 --> 00:18:40,547
You were six, so l brought
six of them.

28
00:18:40,547 --> 00:18:43,847
You're wrong. But you can
have the extra one.

29
00:18:44,547 --> 00:18:46,947
l already had mine.

30
00:18:47,247 --> 00:18:48,847
That's strange.

31
00:18:49,147 --> 00:18:52,947
There were six of you.
Has anyone left?

32
00:18:52,947 --> 00:18:53,947
No.

33
00:19:02,147 --> 00:19:05,447
l'm sure there was one more.

34
00:19:06,347 --> 00:19:08,347
Don't be silly. That's enough.

35
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,747
Now leave us alone.

36
00:19:19,047 --> 00:19:21,147
-She's there.
-Who?

37
00:19:24,347 --> 00:19:25,947
A girl.

38
00:19:25,947 --> 00:19:27,547
No one's there.

39
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:30,947
She was there.

40
00:19:31,947 --> 00:19:35,847
You have another fever?

41
00:19:35,847 --> 00:19:37,247
Tell me...

42
00:19:37,247 --> 00:19:39,147
...who is she?

43
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:41,947
Are you all right?

44
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,847
Wait!

45
00:20:01,447 --> 00:20:05,147
Where are you going?
You're not allowed out.

46
00:21:00,347 --> 00:21:02,147
Hey there, little boy!

47
00:21:08,747 --> 00:21:12,247
We have something to tell you.

48
00:21:14,047 --> 00:21:15,647
Listen carefully.

49
00:21:16,447 --> 00:21:20,047
We'll never go to your house again.

50
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:23,047
Why not?

51
00:21:23,047 --> 00:21:24,547
Your family...

52
00:21:24,947 --> 00:21:26,847
...cut down all the peach trees...

53
00:21:26,847 --> 00:21:28,847
... in this orchard.

54
00:21:30,047 --> 00:21:33,647
But ''Doll Day'' is for the peach blossoms.

55
00:21:34,047 --> 00:21:37,647
lt's to celebrate their arrival.

56
00:21:37,647 --> 00:21:40,847
We dolls personify the peach tree.

57
00:21:41,647 --> 00:21:46,147
We are the spirits of the trees,
the life of the blossoms.

58
00:21:46,947 --> 00:21:51,647
How can you celebrate
with these trees cut down?

59
00:21:53,147 --> 00:21:57,747
Those vanished trees
are weeping in their sorrow.

60
00:22:04,647 --> 00:22:08,247
Don't cry. Tears won't help.

61
00:22:08,547 --> 00:22:10,647
Stop blaming him.

62
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:16,647
This child cried
when they cut down our trees.

63
00:22:17,447 --> 00:22:19,547
He even tried to stop them.

64
00:22:20,347 --> 00:22:22,647
Yes. Because he likes peaches.

65
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:28,747
No!

66
00:22:29,947 --> 00:22:31,847
Peaches can be bought.

67
00:22:32,447 --> 00:22:35,647
But where can you buy
a whole orchard in bloom?

68
00:22:44,147 --> 00:22:45,947
l love this orchard...

69
00:22:46,647 --> 00:22:49,447
...and the peach trees
which bloomed here.

70
00:22:50,847 --> 00:22:55,747
But they're not here anymore.
That's why l cried.

71
00:23:11,047 --> 00:23:13,047
Very well. l understand.

72
00:23:15,947 --> 00:23:18,647
He is a good boy.

73
00:23:20,747 --> 00:23:22,547
Shall we allow him...

74
00:23:23,247 --> 00:23:28,347
...to see our peach orchard
in bloom once more?

75
00:35:00,294 --> 00:35:05,294
THE BLlZZARD...

76
00:40:50,894 --> 00:40:52,794
lt's getting dark again.

77
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:56,194
lt'll soon be night.

78
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:04,594
Don't be stupid.

79
00:41:06,494 --> 00:41:10,294
We only left camp only a few hours ago.

80
00:41:12,594 --> 00:41:16,094
But we left late. We overslept.

81
00:41:18,194 --> 00:41:19,594
lt can't be.

82
00:41:30,794 --> 00:41:32,394
lt's only eleven.

83
00:41:33,394 --> 00:41:35,194
Your watch is broken.

84
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:37,894
No.

85
00:41:38,794 --> 00:41:40,594
The hands are moving.

86
00:41:44,494 --> 00:41:46,694
The snow makes it
seem dark.

87
00:41:48,894 --> 00:41:50,794
Another storm's coming.

88
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:56,094
Hurry up. Let's move!

89
00:41:56,394 --> 00:41:57,994
Are we on course?

90
00:42:18,194 --> 00:42:19,794
Of course we are.

91
00:42:24,094 --> 00:42:27,794
We'll get through this
gorge very soon.

92
00:42:28,694 --> 00:42:30,294
Our camp isn't far.

93
00:42:30,294 --> 00:42:31,894
We'll soon be there.

94
00:42:33,794 --> 00:42:36,394
Enough! l'm sick of listening to you.

95
00:42:38,194 --> 00:42:40,094
l've had it.

96
00:42:47,694 --> 00:42:48,894
Get up!

97
00:42:50,294 --> 00:42:52,294
Get on your feet! Walk!

98
00:42:54,494 --> 00:42:56,194
We're mountain men.

99
00:42:57,594 --> 00:43:00,594
Can't let a snowstorm beat us.

100
00:43:02,294 --> 00:43:05,994
lt's been like this for three days.

101
00:43:07,394 --> 00:43:10,894
This snowstorm will never be over.

102
00:43:11,294 --> 00:43:12,894
Don't be stupid.

103
00:43:13,694 --> 00:43:14,794
Never!

104
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:19,194
lt's waiting for us to die!

105
00:43:21,294 --> 00:43:22,594
All right.

106
00:43:26,294 --> 00:43:27,994
A short break.

107
00:43:35,994 --> 00:43:37,694
Someone's coming!

108
00:43:43,894 --> 00:43:47,394
Yes. Somebody's coming!

109
00:44:01,794 --> 00:44:05,494
No one's coming! lt's an illusion!

110
00:44:09,994 --> 00:44:12,594
Don't fall asleep!

111
00:44:12,994 --> 00:44:14,994
lf you do you'll die!

112
00:44:19,894 --> 00:44:21,194
Wake up!

113
00:44:22,094 --> 00:44:23,594
Stay awake!

114
00:44:30,194 --> 00:44:31,494
Wake up!

115
00:44:33,394 --> 00:44:34,994
Don't sleep!

116
00:46:30,194 --> 00:46:32,194
The snow is warm.

117
00:46:42,994 --> 00:46:44,994
The ice is hot.

118
00:50:27,594 --> 00:50:28,894
Wake up!

119
00:50:28,894 --> 00:50:30,494
Are you all right?

120
00:50:43,294 --> 00:50:44,994
Wake up! Come on!

121
00:52:38,494 --> 00:52:41,694
Look! Look at that!

122
00:52:42,994 --> 00:52:44,194
Our camp.

123
00:52:53,494 --> 00:52:54,794
Our camp.

124
00:52:27,841 --> 00:52:31,841
THE TUNNEL

125
00:56:58,941 --> 00:57:00,541
Private Noguchi!

126
00:57:04,741 --> 00:57:06,341
Yes, Commander!

127
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:09,541
You...

128
00:57:09,541 --> 00:57:14,141
Commander, is it true?
Was l really killed in action?

129
00:57:16,341 --> 00:57:17,341
l...

130
00:57:18,741 --> 00:57:21,241
...l can't believe l'm really dead.

131
00:57:22,741 --> 00:57:27,741
l went home. l ate the special cakes
my mother made for me.

132
00:57:29,341 --> 00:57:32,441
l remember it well.

133
00:57:38,541 --> 00:57:40,541
You told me that before.

134
00:57:44,841 --> 00:57:46,941
You were shot. You fainted.

135
00:57:48,541 --> 00:57:52,441
Then you woke up. l was tending you
and you told me that story.

136
00:57:57,141 --> 00:58:03,141
lt was a dream. You dreamt it
while you were unconscious.

137
00:58:05,741 --> 00:58:09,441
lt was so strong l still remember it.

138
00:58:12,941 --> 00:58:16,741
But after five minutes or so you died.

139
00:58:19,041 --> 00:58:20,641
You really died.

140
00:58:32,341 --> 00:58:33,541
l see.

141
00:58:35,841 --> 00:58:38,841
But my parents...

142
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:41,641
...don't believe l'm dead.

143
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:22,641
That's my home.

144
00:59:27,541 --> 00:59:29,441
My mother and father...

145
00:59:31,341 --> 00:59:32,841
...are there...

146
00:59:33,441 --> 00:59:35,441
...still waiting for me.

147
00:59:57,341 --> 01:00:02,841
But it's a fact. You died.

148
01:00:06,641 --> 01:00:10,141
l'm so sorry, but you died.

149
01:00:13,641 --> 01:00:16,041
You're really dead. You died...

150
01:00:17,441 --> 01:00:18,941
...in my arms.

151
01:01:06,841 --> 01:01:08,041
Noguchi!

152
01:03:20,941 --> 01:03:22,041
Halt!

153
01:03:25,741 --> 01:03:28,341
Salute the Commander!

154
01:03:29,441 --> 01:03:30,741
Present...

155
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:32,941
...arms!

156
01:03:37,541 --> 01:03:38,741
At ease!

157
01:03:42,841 --> 01:03:45,441
Third Platoon returning to base, sir.

158
01:03:46,441 --> 01:03:48,441
No casualties.

159
01:04:02,841 --> 01:04:04,041
Listen.

160
01:04:10,641 --> 01:04:15,841
l understand how you must feel.

161
01:04:20,141 --> 01:04:21,641
Nevertheless...

162
01:04:22,641 --> 01:04:26,241
...the third Platoon was annihilated.

163
01:04:30,541 --> 01:04:33,841
You were all killed in action.

164
01:04:40,441 --> 01:04:41,741
l'm sorry.

165
01:04:50,841 --> 01:04:53,041
l wasn't killed. l survived.

166
01:04:54,041 --> 01:04:56,541
l can hardly look you in the face.

167
01:05:02,341 --> 01:05:04,441
l sent you out to die.

168
01:05:07,241 --> 01:05:08,741
l was to blame.

169
01:05:15,341 --> 01:05:18,441
l could place all the responsibility...

170
01:05:21,541 --> 01:05:23,641
...on the stupidity of war.

171
01:05:24,441 --> 01:05:26,841
But l can't blame that.

172
01:05:30,541 --> 01:05:34,241
l can't deny my thoughtlessness.
My misconduct.

173
01:05:43,041 --> 01:05:44,441
However...

174
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:47,641
...l was taken prisoner.

175
01:05:50,041 --> 01:05:55,241
l suffered so much in the camp
that l felt dying was easier.

176
01:05:58,341 --> 01:05:59,441
And...

177
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:02,841
...now...

178
01:06:05,141 --> 01:06:07,041
...as l look at you...

179
01:06:10,541 --> 01:06:12,541
...l feel that same pain.

180
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:24,041
l know that your suffering and torture
were much greater.

181
01:06:28,841 --> 01:06:29,941
But...

182
01:06:31,041 --> 01:06:32,541
...honestly...

183
01:06:37,541 --> 01:06:38,741
...l...

184
01:06:42,741 --> 01:06:45,441
...l would have wanted to die with you.

185
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:53,741
l really would have.

186
01:06:54,141 --> 01:06:55,541
Believe me.

187
01:07:02,141 --> 01:07:07,741
l feel your bitterness.

188
01:07:13,141 --> 01:07:14,241
They call you ''heroes''...

189
01:07:14,241 --> 01:07:15,441
...but you died...

190
01:07:17,041 --> 01:07:18,041
...like dogs.

191
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:26,641
However...

192
01:07:28,941 --> 01:07:32,241
...returning to the world
like this proves nothing.

193
01:07:37,241 --> 01:07:38,441
Please!

194
01:07:41,841 --> 01:07:43,041
Go back.

195
01:07:47,741 --> 01:07:49,941
Go back and rest in peace.

196
01:08:13,141 --> 01:08:14,641
Third Platoon!

197
01:08:17,041 --> 01:08:20,541
About face!

198
01:08:25,541 --> 01:08:26,941
Forward...

199
01:08:28,741 --> 01:08:30,041
...march!

200
01:09:55,488 --> 01:10:00,188
CROWS

201
01:12:02,988 --> 01:12:04,088
Hello.

202
01:12:04,788 --> 01:12:07,488
Do you know
where Vincent Van Gogh lives?

203
01:12:08,088 --> 01:12:09,588
You looking for him?

204
01:12:09,588 --> 01:12:12,888
He crossed the bridge
and went that way.

205
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:15,488
Thanks.

206
01:12:19,588 --> 01:12:20,688
But...

207
01:12:20,688 --> 01:12:24,388
...be careful. He's been
in a lunatic asylum.

208
01:14:02,488 --> 01:14:04,588
Aren't you Vincent Van Gogh?

209
01:27:24,735 --> 01:27:28,735
MOUNT FUJI lN RED

210
01:27:30,535 --> 01:27:31,935
What is it?

211
01:27:32,535 --> 01:27:34,135
What's happening?

212
01:28:07,635 --> 01:28:09,235
Has Fuji erupted?

213
01:28:10,635 --> 01:28:12,235
How terrible.

214
01:28:13,135 --> 01:28:14,935
lt's worse than that!

215
01:28:15,735 --> 01:28:17,335
Didn't you know?

216
01:28:17,635 --> 01:28:20,135
The nuclear power
plant has exploded.

217
01:28:21,235 --> 01:28:23,235
The six atomic reactors.

218
01:28:23,835 --> 01:28:27,135
They're exploding one after another.

219
01:28:57,835 --> 01:29:00,335
Japan is so small there's no escape.

220
01:29:00,335 --> 01:29:01,635
We all know that.

221
01:29:01,635 --> 01:29:06,635
No way out. But still we have to try.
No other way.

222
01:30:12,335 --> 01:30:13,935
This is the end.

223
01:30:15,035 --> 01:30:16,135
But...

224
01:30:17,635 --> 01:30:19,235
...what happened?

225
01:30:19,935 --> 01:30:22,235
Where did all those people go?

226
01:30:22,935 --> 01:30:24,935
Where did they escape to?

227
01:30:27,835 --> 01:30:29,835
To the bottom of the sea.

228
01:30:46,035 --> 01:30:47,535
The dolphins.

229
01:30:48,335 --> 01:30:50,135
Even they're leaving.

230
01:30:50,835 --> 01:30:52,435
Lucky dolphins.

231
01:30:53,435 --> 01:30:55,135
They can swim away.

232
01:30:57,635 --> 01:30:59,135
lt won't help.

233
01:30:59,835 --> 01:31:02,235
The radioactivity will get them.

234
01:31:07,035 --> 01:31:08,535
The clouds...

235
01:31:18,535 --> 01:31:20,135
...the red one.

236
01:31:20,735 --> 01:31:22,435
lt's Plutonium-239.

237
01:31:24,135 --> 01:31:28,035
10,000,000th of a gram causes cancer.

238
01:31:31,435 --> 01:31:33,735
The yellow one is strontium-90.

239
01:31:34,735 --> 01:31:36,535
lt gets inside you...

240
01:31:37,935 --> 01:31:39,835
...and causes leukemia.

241
01:31:43,635 --> 01:31:47,335
The purple one is cesium-137.

242
01:31:48,535 --> 01:31:50,235
lt affects reproduction.

243
01:31:50,235 --> 01:31:52,035
lt causes mutations.

244
01:31:52,835 --> 01:31:54,735
lt makes monstrosities.

245
01:31:59,135 --> 01:32:01,535
Man's stupidity is unbelievable.

246
01:32:02,735 --> 01:32:05,035
Radioactivity was invisible.

247
01:32:05,335 --> 01:32:09,235
And because of its danger, they colored it.

248
01:32:11,135 --> 01:32:16,035
But that only lets you know
which kind kills you.

249
01:32:17,235 --> 01:32:19,735
Death's calling card.

250
01:32:29,035 --> 01:32:30,535
See you later.

251
01:32:35,635 --> 01:32:37,635
Wait!

252
01:32:38,835 --> 01:32:42,135
Radiation doesn't kill you at once.

253
01:32:42,135 --> 01:32:43,435
So what?

254
01:32:43,735 --> 01:32:44,935
A slow death is even worse.

255
01:32:44,935 --> 01:32:46,035
l refuse to die slowly, adults dying--

256
01:32:46,035 --> 01:32:49,935
They've lived long enough already.

257
01:32:50,235 --> 01:32:53,935
But the children haven't even
lived yet. lt's unfair.

258
01:32:54,435 --> 01:32:58,435
Waiting to die isn't living.

259
01:32:58,535 --> 01:33:01,835
They told us that nuclear plants were safe.

260
01:33:02,635 --> 01:33:06,635
Human accident is the danger,
not the nuclear plant itself.

261
01:33:07,535 --> 01:33:13,535
No accidents, no danger. That's
what they told us. What liars!

262
01:33:14,635 --> 01:33:19,235
lf they're not hanged for this,
l'll kill them myself.

263
01:33:19,235 --> 01:33:22,735
Don't worry. The radioactivity
will do that for you.

264
01:33:28,235 --> 01:33:29,635
l'm sorry.

265
01:33:31,935 --> 01:33:35,335
l am one of those who deserve to die.

266
01:44:51,582 --> 01:44:55,882
THE WEEPlNG DEMON

267
01:48:49,182 --> 01:48:50,882
Human, aren't you?

268
01:49:02,482 --> 01:49:04,082
What's wrong?

269
01:49:23,582 --> 01:49:25,782
Are you a demon?

270
01:49:32,682 --> 01:49:34,182
l suppose so.

271
01:49:36,782 --> 01:49:40,782
But l used to be human.

272
01:49:44,682 --> 01:49:46,182
What a world.

273
01:49:47,582 --> 01:49:48,882
How stupid!

274
01:50:15,682 --> 01:50:16,982
Long ago...

275
01:50:19,282 --> 01:50:22,982
...this place was a beautiful field
of flowers.

276
01:50:26,282 --> 01:50:31,382
Then those nuclear bombs,
those missiles...

277
01:50:33,482 --> 01:50:35,682
...turned it into this desert.

278
01:50:43,582 --> 01:50:44,682
Now...

279
01:50:50,982 --> 01:50:53,982
...because of all that fallout...

280
01:50:58,182 --> 01:51:00,082
...strange flowers grow.

281
01:51:39,082 --> 01:51:40,982
Dandelions.

282
01:51:42,982 --> 01:51:44,282
Dandelions?

283
01:51:51,182 --> 01:51:52,882
Monster dandelions.

284
01:52:13,682 --> 01:52:15,182
This is a rose.

285
01:52:16,982 --> 01:52:19,382
The stem grows from the flower...

286
01:52:21,082 --> 01:52:23,382
...and a strange bud at the top.

287
01:52:29,782 --> 01:52:32,082
This is all radiation polluted.

288
01:52:34,882 --> 01:52:36,782
lt makes this mutation.

289
01:52:39,282 --> 01:52:41,282
The flowers are crippled.

290
01:52:44,782 --> 01:52:46,382
Not only flowers.

291
01:52:48,182 --> 01:52:51,482
Human beings, too. Look at me.

292
01:53:00,382 --> 01:53:02,382
Stupid mankind did this.

293
01:53:04,282 --> 01:53:07,882
lt made our planet a junkyard
for poisonous wastes.

294
01:53:11,382 --> 01:53:16,482
Nature has vanished from the earth,
the nature we used to enjoy.

295
01:53:19,582 --> 01:53:22,082
We've lost the birds, animals, fish.

296
01:53:26,482 --> 01:53:28,082
Some time ago...

297
01:53:29,782 --> 01:53:31,882
...l saw a two-faced hare...

298
01:53:32,782 --> 01:53:34,582
...a one-eyed bird...

299
01:53:35,782 --> 01:53:37,482
...and a hairy fish.

300
01:53:57,182 --> 01:53:59,382
How do you eat then?

301
01:54:03,182 --> 01:54:04,782
There's no food!

302
01:54:06,982 --> 01:54:08,782
We feed on ourselves.

303
01:54:12,382 --> 01:54:14,582
The weak ones go first.

304
01:54:18,382 --> 01:54:20,282
lt's about my turn now.

305
01:54:24,482 --> 01:54:26,482
Even here, we have grades.

306
01:54:29,082 --> 01:54:32,682
One-horn demons like myself always get...

307
01:54:34,582 --> 01:54:38,182
...eaten by those
who have two or three horns.

308
01:54:42,282 --> 01:54:45,182
Before, they were powerful and pretentious.

309
01:54:46,782 --> 01:54:50,782
And now they still throw
their weight around as demons.

310
01:55:02,282 --> 01:55:04,482
So, let them have their way.

311
01:55:07,282 --> 01:55:09,482
Let them have all those horns.

312
01:55:11,082 --> 01:55:13,682
So, let them live in torture,
looking the way they do.

313
01:55:13,682 --> 01:55:14,982
lt's hell.

314
01:55:16,882 --> 01:55:18,482
Worse than death.

315
01:55:19,282 --> 01:55:23,582
They can't die even if they want to.

316
01:55:29,182 --> 01:55:31,082
That's their punishment--

317
01:55:31,982 --> 01:55:33,382
immortality.

318
01:55:35,982 --> 01:55:37,982
Tortured by their sins...

319
01:55:39,782 --> 01:55:42,382
...they must suffer forever.

320
01:55:46,782 --> 01:55:49,482
They'll eat me soon. l'll be released.

321
01:55:53,182 --> 01:55:56,182
But l don't want to be eaten.

322
01:55:58,182 --> 01:56:00,282
That's why l'm running away.

323
01:56:02,982 --> 01:56:08,482
But then l get so hungry that...

324
01:56:11,782 --> 01:56:14,082
...l feel disgusted with myself.

325
01:56:17,782 --> 01:56:20,882
l was a farmer when l was a man.

326
01:56:23,882 --> 01:56:28,482
l dumped gallons of milk
in the river to keep the prices up.

327
01:56:31,482 --> 01:56:35,782
l buried potatoes and cabbages
with a bulldozer.

328
01:56:37,182 --> 01:56:38,982
How stupid!

329
01:57:13,382 --> 01:57:14,682
Hear that?

330
01:57:17,082 --> 01:57:18,882
When night comes...

331
01:57:20,582 --> 01:57:23,382
...those famous demons
scream out in pain.

332
01:57:26,282 --> 01:57:29,182
Their horns hurt them worse than a cancer.

333
01:57:32,082 --> 01:57:36,082
They pray for death, but are condemned
to live in pain for eternity.

334
01:57:38,082 --> 01:57:40,482
But no one kills them.

335
01:57:41,682 --> 01:57:43,482
So they just scream.

336
01:57:50,282 --> 01:57:52,082
Come, l'll show you.

337
01:57:54,182 --> 01:57:56,082
You'll see how they cry.

338
02:00:47,282 --> 02:00:50,082
My horn's beginning to hurt, too.

339
02:00:56,582 --> 02:00:57,782
Go away.

340
02:00:59,782 --> 02:01:01,982
Go where?

341
02:01:19,582 --> 02:01:23,082
Do you want to become a demon, too?

342
02:02:20,729 --> 02:02:25,229
VILLAGE OF THE WATERMILLS

343
02:02:57,329 --> 02:02:58,729
Good day.

344
02:02:59,229 --> 02:03:00,829
Good day.

345
02:04:23,029 --> 02:04:23,929
Good day.

346
02:04:29,229 --> 02:04:31,129
Good day.

347
02:04:32,929 --> 02:04:35,229
What's the name of this village?

348
02:04:36,229 --> 02:04:37,829
Doesn't have one.

349
02:04:39,729 --> 02:04:42,929
We just call it ''The Village''.

350
02:04:44,629 --> 02:04:48,629
Some people call it Watermill Village.

351
02:04:52,629 --> 02:04:55,929
Do all the villagers live here?

352
02:04:56,629 --> 02:04:57,729
No.

353
02:04:58,929 --> 02:05:01,329
They live in other places.

354
02:05:05,929 --> 02:05:08,129
There's no electricity here?

355
02:05:09,529 --> 02:05:11,129
Don't need it.

356
02:05:13,329 --> 02:05:16,029
People get too used to convenience.

357
02:05:17,729 --> 02:05:20,829
They think convenience is better.

358
02:05:21,929 --> 02:05:24,329
They throw out what's truly good.

359
02:05:27,629 --> 02:05:29,529
But what about lights?

360
02:05:32,029 --> 02:05:35,729
We've got candles and linseed oil.

361
02:05:36,929 --> 02:05:38,729
But night's so dark.

362
02:05:39,929 --> 02:05:42,729
Yes. That's what night is supposed to be.

363
02:05:43,629 --> 02:05:47,029
Why should night be as bright as day?

364
02:05:49,129 --> 02:05:53,729
l wouldn't like nights so bright
you couldn't see the stars.

365
02:05:58,729 --> 02:06:00,329
You have paddies.

366
02:06:01,329 --> 02:06:04,429
But no tractors to cultivate them?

367
02:06:05,529 --> 02:06:07,129
Don't need them.

368
02:06:09,029 --> 02:06:12,229
We've got cows, and horses.

369
02:06:14,229 --> 02:06:16,629
What do you use for fuel?

370
02:06:19,029 --> 02:06:21,329
Firewood mostly.

371
02:06:23,029 --> 02:06:26,129
We don't feel right, chopping down trees,
but...

372
02:06:26,729 --> 02:06:29,229
...enough fall down by themselves.

373
02:06:29,729 --> 02:06:33,129
We cut them up and use them as firewood.

374
02:06:35,929 --> 02:06:39,629
And if you make charcoal from the wood...

375
02:06:40,329 --> 02:06:44,729
...just a few trees can give you
as much heat as a whole forest.

376
02:06:47,129 --> 02:06:52,329
Yes, and cow dung make good fuel, too.

377
02:07:18,929 --> 02:07:22,729
We try to live the way man used to.

378
02:07:23,729 --> 02:07:26,729
That's the natural way of life.

379
02:07:29,329 --> 02:07:31,729
People today have forgotten...

380
02:07:31,729 --> 02:07:35,729
...they're really just a part of nature.

381
02:07:38,629 --> 02:07:40,929
Yet, they destroy the nature...

382
02:07:42,029 --> 02:07:45,029
...on which our lives depend.

383
02:07:45,829 --> 02:07:49,529
They always think
they can make something better.

384
02:07:51,729 --> 02:07:53,929
Especially scientists.

385
02:07:55,229 --> 02:07:57,229
They may be smart but...

386
02:07:58,429 --> 02:08:00,729
...most don't understand...

387
02:08:00,729 --> 02:08:03,729
...the heart of nature.

388
02:08:06,029 --> 02:08:10,729
They only invent things that
in the end make people unhappy.

389
02:08:11,429 --> 02:08:14,729
Yet they're so proud of their inventions.

390
02:08:17,329 --> 02:08:22,429
What's worse, most people are, too.
They view them...

391
02:08:23,129 --> 02:08:27,129
...as if they were miracles.

392
02:08:27,529 --> 02:08:29,229
They worship them.

393
02:08:34,729 --> 02:08:38,529
They don't know it,
but they're losing nature.

394
02:08:39,229 --> 02:08:42,829
They don't see that they're going to perish.

395
02:08:46,129 --> 02:08:50,129
The most important things
for human beings are...

396
02:08:50,929 --> 02:08:54,129
...clean air and clean water...

397
02:08:55,529 --> 02:08:59,129
...and the trees and grass
that produce them.

398
02:08:59,729 --> 02:09:02,029
Everything is being dirtied...

399
02:09:03,229 --> 02:09:05,029
...polluted forever.

400
02:09:06,629 --> 02:09:09,529
Dirty air, dirty water...

401
02:09:10,029 --> 02:09:14,329
...dirtying the hearts of men.

402
02:09:33,729 --> 02:09:36,329
On my way here, l happened to see...

403
02:09:37,329 --> 02:09:41,829
...some children putting flowers
on a stone beside the bridge.

404
02:09:42,529 --> 02:09:43,629
Why?

405
02:09:45,029 --> 02:09:46,229
Oh, that.

406
02:09:48,529 --> 02:09:51,929
My father told me once.

407
02:09:53,729 --> 02:09:55,629
Long ago...

408
02:09:56,429 --> 02:10:01,429
...a sick traveller died by the bridge.

409
02:10:03,329 --> 02:10:08,729
The villagers took pity
and buried him right there.

410
02:10:09,929 --> 02:10:12,629
They placed a large
stone on his tomb...

411
02:10:13,429 --> 02:10:16,029
...and put flowers on it.

412
02:10:17,529 --> 02:10:21,529
lt became a custom to put flowers there.

413
02:10:24,629 --> 02:10:26,629
Not only the children.

414
02:10:26,629 --> 02:10:28,429
All the villagers...

415
02:10:28,829 --> 02:10:31,329
...put flowers there as they pass...

416
02:10:32,329 --> 02:10:36,229
...though most don't know why.

417
02:10:49,829 --> 02:10:52,029
ls there a celebration today?

418
02:10:55,829 --> 02:10:58,429
No, a funeral.

419
02:11:00,329 --> 02:11:03,029
You find this strange?

420
02:11:03,929 --> 02:11:07,029
A nice, happy funeral.

421
02:11:09,029 --> 02:11:10,429
lt's good...

422
02:11:10,429 --> 02:11:12,029
...to work hard...

423
02:11:12,929 --> 02:11:16,429
...and live long and then be thanked.

424
02:11:18,529 --> 02:11:22,029
We have no temple or priest here.

425
02:11:22,429 --> 02:11:24,329
So all the villagers...

426
02:11:24,629 --> 02:11:26,329
...carry the dead...

427
02:11:26,729 --> 02:11:30,729
...to the cemetery on the hill.

428
02:11:33,029 --> 02:11:37,629
We don't like it
when young adults or children die.

429
02:11:38,329 --> 02:11:41,629
lt's hard to celebrate such a loss.

430
02:11:42,429 --> 02:11:44,229
But fortunately...

431
02:11:44,229 --> 02:11:49,129
...the people of this village
lead a natural way of life.

432
02:11:49,629 --> 02:11:53,529
So they pass on at a ripe old age.

433
02:11:55,529 --> 02:11:58,229
The woman we're burying today...

434
02:11:58,529 --> 02:12:02,529
...lived to be ninety-nine.

435
02:12:04,329 --> 02:12:07,929
You must excuse me...

436
02:12:08,529 --> 02:12:10,629
...but l'm going to join the procession.

437
02:12:17,029 --> 02:12:18,729
To tell the truth...

438
02:12:18,729 --> 02:12:22,729
...she was my first love.

439
02:12:25,629 --> 02:12:27,429
But broke my heart...

440
02:12:27,729 --> 02:12:31,529
...and left me for another.

441
02:13:06,929 --> 02:13:09,229
By the way, how old are you?

442
02:13:10,629 --> 02:13:11,629
Me?

443
02:13:12,729 --> 02:13:14,629
One hundred-plus three.

444
02:13:15,929 --> 02:13:19,529
A good age to stop living.

445
02:13:20,729 --> 02:13:25,729
Some say life is hard.

446
02:13:26,029 --> 02:13:29,629
That's just talk.

447
02:13:29,929 --> 02:13:33,329
ln fact, it's good
to be alive.

448
02:13:33,929 --> 02:13:35,429
lt's exciting.
