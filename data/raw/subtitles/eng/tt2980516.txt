The signals that muscles must receive
in order to move are disrupted.

The result is
gradual muscle decay.

01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:35,764
Oh, I see. I... (CHUCKLES)
I thought that, um,

889
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:39,852
you'd proved the universe had a beginning
and thus a need for a creator.

890
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:42,438
(CHUCKLES) My mistake.

891
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:45,566
No, mine.

892
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:50,321
Stephen is looking
for a single theory

893
01:05:50,405 --> 01:05:52,990
that explains all the
forces in the universe.

894
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,035
Therefore, God must die.

895
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:58,579
Oh, uh, why must God die?
I don't see.

896
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:02,207
The two great pillars
of physics

897
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:04,877
are quantum theory,

898
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:09,298
the laws that govern the very small
particles, electrons and so on,

899
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:12,343
and general relativity.

900
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:14,094
Ah, yes, Einstein.

901
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:15,679
Einstein's theory,
the laws that govern

902
01:06:15,764 --> 01:06:17,598
the very large planets
and such.

903
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:20,726
But quantum and relativity...

904
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:22,853
Don't tell me.
They're different?

905
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:26,023
They don't remotely
play by the same rules.

906
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:30,527
If the world were all
potatoes, then, easy.

907
01:06:30,612 --> 01:06:33,322
You could trace
a precise beginning

908
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:35,199
as Stephen once did.

909
01:06:35,659 --> 01:06:37,493
A moment of creation.

910
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:40,954
Hallelujah. God lives.

911
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:43,207
If you incorporate peas
into the menu,

912
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:44,833
well, then it all
goes a little...

913
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:47,378
- Tits up.
- Oh. (CHUCKLING)

914
01:06:47,462 --> 01:06:49,546
Yes. Haywire.

915
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:51,840
- It just all becomes a godless mess.
- Oh, dear.

916
01:06:52,634 --> 01:06:54,510
- (CHUCKLING)
- Einstein hated peas.

917
01:06:55,303 --> 01:06:59,932
Quantum theory. He said, "God doesn't
play dice with the universe."

918
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,894
STEPHEN: Seems
he not only plays dice,

919
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:09,400
but he throws them
where we can't find them.

920
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:13,112
God is back on the endangered species list.
(JONATHAN CHUCKLING)

921
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:16,448
Well, I expect he'll cope.

922
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:20,244
And physics
is back in business.

923
01:07:20,328 --> 01:07:21,495
JANE: Yes.

924
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:25,457
Physics is back in business.

925
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:38,971
I was, uh, married,
actually.

926
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:42,975
Um... But, sadly,
she passed.

927
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:46,937
Almost a year ago now.

928
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:48,355
(EXHALING)

929
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:51,275
It was, uh, leukemia.

930
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:56,488
Um, she fought it
and I nursed her.

931
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,908
But, uh, in the end...

932
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:01,618
Um...
(SIGHING)

933
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:07,207
I do get quite lonely.

934
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:10,502
The, uh, (INHALING DEEPLY)
tyranny of the empty room

935
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:12,963
and all that.

936
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:17,968
But music is my salvation.
Teaching and playing.

937
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:21,096
Not really as a career,
but I'm not very ambitious.

938
01:08:21,181 --> 01:08:22,848
Though that's not...

939
01:08:23,725 --> 01:08:25,517
(SIGHING)

940
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:31,231
Is that a sin?
I don't know.

941
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:35,694
Wrong man to ask.

942
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:43,452
Thank you so much
for having me.

943
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:46,246
- Thank you for coming.
- It was really, really wonderful.

944
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:49,708
If there's anything
I can do to be of service,

945
01:08:49,793 --> 01:08:50,834
um, to you,

946
01:08:50,919 --> 01:08:53,295
to the family,
I mean, I would

947
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:55,047
consider it a privilege.

948
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:58,717
I have no children
or commitments, so...

949
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:02,971
I only mean that
if I could be of help,

950
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:05,474
I believe I might
find a purpose that would

951
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:08,227
help alleviate my own,
um, situation. (CHUCKLES)

952
01:09:10,522 --> 01:09:11,522
Good night.

953
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:13,732
Night.

954
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:52,104
I understand

955
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:56,775
if you need help.

956
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:05,576
If someone is prepared
to offer it,

957
01:10:09,664 --> 01:10:11,957
I won't object.

958
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:52,706
(LAUGHING)

959
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:56,418
Chilly? (CHUCKLING)

960
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,170
(CHUCKLING)
Yeah, it's very bracing.

961
01:11:30,328 --> 01:11:31,787
(CHUCKLES)
Come on. Ready?

962
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:33,538
- Yeah.
- (GRUNTING) All right.

963
01:11:36,084 --> 01:11:38,418
17, 18...

964
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,887
There we go. Right. I'm
going to put the kettle on.

965
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:06,738

JONATHAN: Great, lovely, okay.
We can go.

970
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,662
Just gone 7:45.

971
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:59,458
- (CHUCKLES) Um, could you all
leave your copies? - Goodbye.

972
01:13:06,007 --> 01:13:07,466
There's something
I need to tell you.

973
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:09,885
What?

974
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:12,137
I'm pregnant.

975
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:15,057
(CHUCKLES)

976
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:17,851
Gosh, I, um, assumed
that you and Stephen, um...

977
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:21,772
Well, that's
really wonderful.

978
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:24,941
- It is.
- Yes, wonderful.

979
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:27,944
(CHUCKLES)
Congratulations, Jane.

980
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:30,197
Thank you.

981
01:13:45,713 --> 01:13:47,047
Everyone say, "Cheese."
Ready?

982
01:13:47,131 --> 01:13:49,216
On the count of three.
One, two, three.

983
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:50,926
ALL: Cheese!

984
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:53,804
Cheese.

985
01:13:58,059 --> 01:14:00,310
JANE: (GASPING) Is that your brother?
On his bike?

986
01:14:04,232 --> 01:14:06,108
- LUCY: Mummy!
- Just coming.

01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:08,944
Oh, come on, sweetie.
Come on...

988
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:17,786
Now, you know
(CLEARING THROAT)

989
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:22,207
I've always been supportive of
your choice not to have home help,

990
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:25,377
but we need to find
a permanent solution.

991
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,213
This, uh, situation
cannot continue.

992
01:14:28,339 --> 01:14:33,385
You need to have a proper
live-in nurse immediately.

993
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:35,554
We have help.

994
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:39,641
Look, you know
what I'm talking about.

995
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:43,145
We can't afford
a live-in nurse.

996
01:14:43,563 --> 01:14:45,021
Stephen, you need
to find a way

997
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:47,149
for your family's sake.

998
01:14:47,567 --> 01:14:49,151
You're world-famous.

999
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:53,321
For black holes,
not for rock concerts.

1000
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:56,158
Stephen, this isn't funny.

1001
01:14:57,034 --> 01:14:58,785
I believe it's urgent.

1002
01:15:17,305 --> 01:15:18,805
(WATER RUSHING)

1003
01:15:20,224 --> 01:15:22,392
We do have
a right to know.

1004
01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:24,603
We have a right
to know, Jane.

1005
01:15:27,815 --> 01:15:29,149
Know what?

1006
01:15:30,568 --> 01:15:32,694
ISOBEL: Whose child
Timothy is.

1007
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:35,113
Stephen's or Jonathan's.

1008
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:39,826
That's what
you think of me.

1009
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:45,248
There's no way that Timothy could
have any other father than Stephen.

1010
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:46,458
None.

1011
01:15:50,588 --> 01:15:51,880
(DOOR CLOSING)

1012
01:15:57,345 --> 01:15:58,678
Jonathan.

1013
01:15:58,763 --> 01:16:00,513
- Please don't go.
- I have to go.

1014
01:16:00,598 --> 01:16:02,224
Come on.
Everyone is talking...

1015
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:03,808
So, what does it matter?

1016
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:05,685
It's difficult for me because
I'm just trying to help.

1017
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:08,230
I know you're trying to help,
and your help is valued.

1018
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:11,066
The best thing for me right now is...
I think maybe if (STAMMERING)

1019
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:12,901
I just
step back for now.

1020
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:14,903
Please, Jonathan.
We need you.

1021
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:17,447
The children need you, and I
need you, and Stephen needs you.

1022
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:19,574
- Jonathan.
- There's other things as well.

1023
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:21,326
Jane, I...

1024
01:16:22,203 --> 01:16:23,328
(SIGHING)

1025
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:25,455
I have feelings for you.

1026
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:32,587
And I have feelings
for you, too.

1027
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:39,177
Thank you, Jane.

1028
01:17:28,102 --> 01:17:32,397
I've been invited
to the Bordeaux Opera.

1029
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:34,524
Invited where?

1030
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:36,776
Bordeaux.

1031
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:40,238
- To Bordeaux?
- Mmm.

Wagner.

1033
01:17:43,451 --> 01:17:45,785
The students
can take me.

1034
01:17:46,412 --> 01:17:48,955
I know you hate flying.

1035

(CHUCKLING)

1036
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:52,250
I do hate to fly.

1037
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:55,045
Bring the car.

1038
01:17:55,588 --> 01:17:58,548
Meet me in Bordeaux.

1039
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:03,928
Take the children camping.

1040
01:18:06,766 --> 01:18:09,100
It'll be too difficult
to manage, Stephen.

1041
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:18,693
Bring Jonathan.

1042
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:26,493
I doubt he would
be willing.

1044
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:45,303
Hello, Stephen.

01:19:01,779 --> 01:19:03,196
Is this okay?

1046
01:19:03,614 --> 01:19:04,906
Well...

1047
01:19:05,908 --> 01:19:07,325
I won't tell if you won't.

1048
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:22,632
Just bearing in mind
you have to drive.

1049

(LAUGHING)

1050
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:41,568
Jane needs help.

1051
01:19:56,167 --> 01:19:58,168
- Sarah, you won't forget
a vitamin B injection... - Yes?

1052
01:19:58,252 --> 01:19:59,502
- ...as soon as you land.
- No. Of course.

1053
01:19:59,587 --> 01:20:01,087
- And you'll call me when
you get to the hotel? - I will.

1054
01:20:01,172 --> 01:20:02,714
- Yes? Promise? Good.
- Yes.

1055
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:05,717
Stephen.

1056
01:20:08,095 --> 01:20:09,721
Mum will take the baby.

1057
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:13,433
- (KISSING) She'll be here any minute.
- See you in Bordeaux.

1058
01:20:14,727 --> 01:20:15,894
And be good.

1059
01:20:40,294 --> 01:20:41,669
Are they asleep?

1060
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:42,962
(WHISPERING) Yeah.

01:20:55,893 --> 01:20:57,268
(CHUCKLING)

1062
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:01,272
