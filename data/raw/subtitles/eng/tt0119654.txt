1
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:56,447
Goddamn bugs.

2
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,287
Oh, shit!

3
00:03:21,929 --> 00:03:23,408
Oh, crap.

4
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:37,399
Well, Nick the Dick.
What a surprise.

5
00:03:37,649 --> 00:03:39,048
Where you coming from?

6
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:41,526
Fishing in Cuernavaca.

7
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:43,964
Sure. Let's take a look
at your catch.

8
00:03:45,249 --> 00:03:46,364
Come on.

9
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:55,321
I would've thrown them back.

10
00:04:01,649 --> 00:04:04,209
What do you get?
100 bucks a head? 200?

11
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:07,879
Hope you saved it all for your lawyer.
You'll need it.

12
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:13,564
We'll take it from here.

13
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:15,124
Who the hell are you?

14
00:04:15,369 --> 00:04:16,597
INS, Division 6.

15
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:19,079
Division 6?
I never heard of Division 6.

16
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:20,318
Really?

17
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:22,358
Who you betting on?

18
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:24,443
Tough call, Kay.

19
00:04:25,609 --> 00:04:27,759
What's up, how are you?

20
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:29,408
Good, good.

21
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:32,040
Grandma, don't worry.

22
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:34,598
Welcome to the United States.

23
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:37,279
Where are you going, Nogales?

24
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:39,241
Looking for work?

25
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:41,122
And you, the same?

26
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:42,768
And you?

27
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:44,648
Pleasure seeing you here.

28
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:46,682
And you?

29
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:50,003
What if I break your face?

30
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:54,439
You're very ugly, no?

31
00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:58,200
You don't speak a word of Spanish.

32
00:04:59,489 --> 00:05:00,717
We've got a winner here.

33
00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:02,322
Oh, I know.

34
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,839
The rest of you can leave.

35
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:06,522
Don't move!

36
00:05:06,769 --> 00:05:08,760
Get in the truck and leave.

37
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:09,965
Sir, you can't...

38
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:11,682
Don't "sir" me, young man.

39
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:14,562
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

40
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:18,928
Get in the truck right now!

41
00:05:20,329 --> 00:05:22,638
We'll chat with our friend.
You hit the road.

42
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:27,559
Keep on protecting us from
the dangerous aliens.

43
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:33,560
You ever hear of Division 6?

44
00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:35,481
There is no Division 6.

45
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:36,764
This is bullshit.

46
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:38,078
Hell, yeah.

47
00:05:39,489 --> 00:05:42,526
Looks like you fell off the bus
in the wrong part of town.

48
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:45,488
I'll bet you're not
from anywhere near here.

49
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:50,563
Mikey?

50
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:59,485
Mikey, when they let you out of jail?

51
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:02,084
Political refugee.

52
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:05,082
You know how many treaties
you just violated?

53
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:07,487
- One?
- Try seven.

54
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:12,001
You hand me that head.

55
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:18,928
Put up your arms and flippers.

56
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:31,285
Shit!

57
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:36,888
Shoot him!

58
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:07,848
- "That."
- That...

59
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:13,599
Was not human. I know.
You got some entrails on you.

60
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:15,799
What the hell?

61
00:07:16,049 --> 00:07:17,482
The situation's under control.

62
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:19,805
Give me your attention for a moment.

63
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:21,881
I'll tell you what happened.

64
00:07:30,369 --> 00:07:34,760
This is called a neuralizer. It's
a gift from friends from out of town.

65
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:36,761
This red eye isolates...

66
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:39,921
...the brain's impulses,
specifically the ones for memory.

67
00:07:40,489 --> 00:07:42,605
Give me a splay burn on
the perimeter...

68
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:44,919
...with holes at 40, 60,
and 80 metres...

69
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:47,200
...from right here.
Thank you.

70
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:53,485
That's good.

71
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:55,403
What's going on?

72
00:07:55,689 --> 00:07:57,042
Excellent question.

73
00:07:57,289 --> 00:07:59,803
The answer you're looking for
lies right here.

74
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:04,521
Who are you, really?

75
00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:05,565
Really?

76
00:08:06,609 --> 00:08:09,601
I am just a figment
of your imagination.

77
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:15,685
Damn, what a gullible breed.

78
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:20,205
I'm serious. You're lucky
to be alive after that blast.

79
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:21,245
What blast?

80
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:22,928
The underground gas main.

81
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,285
You should exercise caution
before firing...

82
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:27,838
...l'll tell you that now.
Especially you.

83
00:08:29,329 --> 00:08:32,127
Have yourself checked out with EMS
before you leave.

84
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:45,962
I'm sorry about back there.

85
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:47,403
It happens.

86
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:49,082
Didn't used to.

87
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:53,279
The spirit's willing, Kay...

88
00:08:54,569 --> 00:08:56,287
...but the rest of me...

89
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:00,966
They're beautiful, aren't they?

90
00:09:01,729 --> 00:09:03,208
The stars.

91
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:06,245
We never just look anymore.

92
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:13,241
I'll tell you, Kay...

93
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:16,159
...I will miss the chase.

94
00:09:21,249 --> 00:09:22,079
No, Dee...

95
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:24,324
...you won't.

96
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:27,488
Freeze!

97
00:09:27,689 --> 00:09:29,759
NYPD! Freeze!

98
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:32,443
All yours, Edwards.

99
00:09:34,369 --> 00:09:35,882
Freeze means stop!

100
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,682
What the hell?!

101
00:09:51,849 --> 00:09:54,568
It just be raining black people
in New York.

102
00:10:18,729 --> 00:10:20,208
Do you see this?

103
00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:22,326
N-Y-P-D!

104
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:24,997
Means I will knock your punk-ass down!

105
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,523
He's coming!

106
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:29,442
Yeah, and when he gets here,
I'll arrest his ass too.

107
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:35,364
You trying to catch a beat-down?

108
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:41,124
What's up?

109
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:43,997
He's coming.

110
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:46,962
He's coming because I failed.
Now he'll kill me.

111
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:49,404
You pissing everybody off today, huh?

112
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,761
You don't understand.

113
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:55,079
Your world's gonna end.

114
00:11:58,049 --> 00:11:59,164
What are you?

115
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:07,124
Watch that ledge. Watch the ledge.

116
00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:10,520
Come on down. We'll get those
eyes fixed, don't worry.

117
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:12,839
Wait a minute.
Let me talk to you!

118
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:22,125
I work my butt off to make a living.

119
00:12:22,369 --> 00:12:25,520
All I want is to come home to
a fat steak on the table...

120
00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:27,919
...but instead I get this.
It looks like poison.

121
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:32,248
Don't take that away! I'm eating that!
It is poison, isn't it?

122
00:12:32,489 --> 00:12:34,957
I swear, I wouldn't
be surprised if it was...

123
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:38,645
...the way you skulk like a dog
been hit too much, or not enough!

124
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:40,083
I can't decide.

125
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:41,887
You're useless, Beatrice.

126
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:46,088
The only thing that pulls its weight
around here is my goddamn truck!

127
00:12:55,889 --> 00:12:57,242
Figures.

128
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:07,408
What the heck is it?

129
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:10,685
Get your big butt back in the house.

130
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:26,000
Place projectile weapon on the ground.

131
00:13:26,249 --> 00:13:27,887
You can have my gun...

132
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:30,159
...when you pry it
from my dead fingers.

133
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,639
Your proposal is acceptable.

134
00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:14,921
Edgar, what on earth was that?

135
00:14:15,169 --> 00:14:16,284
Sugar.

136
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:18,879
I've never seen sugar do that.

137
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:22,079
Give me sugar.

138
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:27,837
In water.

139
00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:35,164
More.

140
00:14:38,609 --> 00:14:39,678
More.

141
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:55,640
Your skin is hanging off your bones.

142
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:07,918
Is that better?

143
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:38,683
"The perpetrator blinked
two sets of eyelids."

144
00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:40,567
Blinked with both eyes?

145
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:43,727
He blinked one set,
then a completely different set.

146
00:15:43,969 --> 00:15:46,358
You know, like high beams
and low beams.

147
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:51,118
Was that before or after he drew
the weapon that you claim...

148
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:53,405
...evaporated into a million pieces?

149
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:55,207
After, sir.

150
00:15:56,049 --> 00:15:59,598
Why is it that no other officers saw
either of these events?

151
00:15:59,849 --> 00:16:02,317
Some of them are
soggy around the midsection.

152
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:04,082
They weren't able to keep up.

153
00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:06,245
If you were half the man I am...

154
00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:08,924
I am half the man that you are.

155
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,727
What is your problem?

156
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:12,038
You're in my face.

157
00:16:12,289 --> 00:16:14,678
- I think he threw him off the roof.
- You next.

158
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:15,878
I wanna talk to you.

159
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:18,683
Ten minutes,
you take your best shot, tough guy.

160
00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:23,084
Take 10 minutes on a StairMaster,
you pudgy bastard!

161
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:30,518
I believe you. Laurel Weaver.
Deputy Medical Examiner.

162
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:32,760
Find me at the morgue. I'll show you.

163
00:16:32,969 --> 00:16:33,765
Wait.

164
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:34,999
Wait a minute!

165
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:40,048
You're Dr. Weaver with the coroner's
office working on the John Doe?

166
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,683
- That's right.
- Will you look at this, please?

167
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,008
Some night, huh?

168
00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:52,125
Some night.

169
00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:54,206
They were gills, not eyelids.

170
00:16:55,569 --> 00:16:57,446
Gills. He was out of breath.

171
00:16:58,249 --> 00:16:59,318
Who are you?

172
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:01,161
Did he say anything to you?

173
00:17:01,409 --> 00:17:03,286
He said the world was
coming to an end.

174
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:05,648
Did he say when?

175
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:14,128
Would you recognize his weapon
if you saw it again?

176
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:15,688
Absolutely.

177
00:17:17,249 --> 00:17:18,841
Come on, let's take a ride.

178
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:21,728
Wait a minute. Look, I got
tons of paperwork...

179
00:17:21,969 --> 00:17:22,799
It's all done.

180
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:23,879
Good work.

181
00:17:24,129 --> 00:17:26,927
You really ran this dude down on foot?
That's tough.

182
00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:28,648
That's double tough.

183
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:38,569
So who exactly are you with?

184
00:17:38,569 --> 00:17:40,287
So who exactly are you with?

185
00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:42,599
FBI? NSA?

186
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:47,206
I'm part of a bureau that licenses,
monitors and polices aliens on Earth.

187
00:17:47,449 --> 00:17:48,677
Yeah, whatever.

188
00:17:48,889 --> 00:17:50,083
We're here.

189
00:17:51,969 --> 00:17:53,607
This is where we're going?

190
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:55,682
This is Jack Jeebs' spot.

191
00:17:55,889 --> 00:17:58,119
He buys from chain-snatchers.
Doesn't sell guns.

192
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,358
Really?

193
00:17:59,969 --> 00:18:00,879
All right, look.

194
00:18:01,089 --> 00:18:05,048
I'm gonna go in and put my thing down,
but when I come out, I want answers.

195
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:06,881
Okay, go put your thing down.

196
00:18:12,689 --> 00:18:14,088
Officer Eduardo!

197
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:17,048
How did these get here?
I thought I turned them in.

198
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:20,486
I hear you're into something hotter
than stolen Rolexes.

199
00:18:20,689 --> 00:18:23,328
I deal crack, but I still work here.
I love the hours.

200
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,567
I'm talking about guns, smart-ass!
Weird ones.

201
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:29,842
Come on!
What you see is what I got.

202
00:18:32,129 --> 00:18:33,608
Show him the imports, Jeebs.

203
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:36,247
Hey, Kay. How are you?

204
00:18:36,489 --> 00:18:39,401
- Show him the imports.
- I got out of that business.

205
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:41,082
Why do you lie to me?

206
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:42,718
Hold on a second.

207
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:44,084
I'll count to three.

208
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:47,127
He'll do it, Jeebs.
That man does not look stable.

209
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:49,889
You know what? He's crazy
when he's like this.

210
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,006
He's always crazy.
Get a massage.

211
00:18:52,249 --> 00:18:53,079
Take a cruise...

212
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:56,044
- Drop the weapon.
- I warned him.

213
00:18:56,289 --> 00:18:57,085
Drop the weapon!

214
00:18:57,289 --> 00:18:58,517
- You warned him.
- I'll kill you.

215
00:18:58,769 --> 00:19:01,761
You insensitive jerk!

216
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:07,684
Do you have any idea
how much that stings?

217
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:10,324
Show us the merchandise,
or you'll lose another head.

218
00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:23,445
Mr. Edwards...

219
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:30,566
There, the one in the middle.

220
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:37,045
You sold a reverberating carbonizer
with mutate capacity...

221
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:39,598
...to an unlicensed cephalopoid!
You piece of...

222
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:41,277
He looked okay to me.

223
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:43,320
It was for an assassination.
The target?

224
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:44,445
I don't know.

225
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:46,446
- Goddamn it!
- I don't know!

226
00:19:47,849 --> 00:19:49,123
All that's confiscated.

227
00:19:49,369 --> 00:19:53,282
Be on the next transport off this rock,
or I shoot where it don't grow back.

228
00:19:57,209 --> 00:20:00,121
And I'm gonna be back
to talk about them Rolexes.

229
00:20:21,849 --> 00:20:23,919
Searching for a handle on the moment?

230
00:20:25,569 --> 00:20:27,002
I can't help you.

231
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:29,442
The only comfort I can offer...

232
00:20:29,689 --> 00:20:32,886
...is my promise that tomorrow
you won't remember a thing.

233
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:35,923
That's not exactly
some shit you forget.

234
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:37,568
Ever seen one of these?

235
00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:43,278
She looks over to her husband...

236
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:46,487
...then sets it down in her lap
and says:

237
00:20:46,689 --> 00:20:49,761
"Honey, this one's eating my popcorn."

238
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:53,918
Get it?

239
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,443
This one's eating...

240
00:20:57,729 --> 00:20:59,765
Gotta go.
Thanks for the egg rolls.

241
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,237
Wait a minute.

242
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:02,325
Who are you?

243
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:05,037
See what I mean about tequila?
You're very bright.

244
00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:06,961
But you need to lay off the sauce.

245
00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:09,359
I'll see you bright and early, 9:00.

246
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:10,405
Be there...

247
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,648
...or be square.

248
00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:34,488
Well, well, well.

249
00:21:34,729 --> 00:21:37,880
Moving right in, are we?
Think we own the place?

250
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:39,920
I got an eviction notice for you.

251
00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:42,842
Just what exactly
do you think you're doing here?

252
00:21:43,089 --> 00:21:45,045
Taking care of your pest problem.

253
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:46,563
Pest problem?

254
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:48,558
Pest?

255
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:50,680
You got a hell of an infestation.

256
00:21:50,889 --> 00:21:53,608
You know, I've noticed
an infestation here.

257
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:56,482
Everywhere I look, nothing but
undeveloped, unevolved...

258
00:21:56,729 --> 00:21:59,118
...barely conscious pond scum...

259
00:21:59,329 --> 00:22:01,889
...totally convinced
of their own superiority...

260
00:22:02,129 --> 00:22:04,120
...as they scurry about their short...

261
00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:06,041
...pointless lives.

262
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:10,681
Don't you wanna get rid of them?

263
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,567
In the worst way.

264
00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:48,282
Help you?

265
00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:50,480
This dude gave me this card...

266
00:22:50,729 --> 00:22:51,957
Elevator.

267
00:23:15,689 --> 00:23:17,839
You're late. Sit down.

268
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,968
My name is Zed.

269
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:28,883
You're all here
because you're the best.

270
00:23:29,089 --> 00:23:33,480
Marines, Air Force, Navy SEALs,
Army Rangers, NYPD.

271
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:34,964
We want one of you.

272
00:23:35,489 --> 00:23:36,558
Just one.

273
00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:39,448
What will follow is
a series of simple tests...

274
00:23:39,689 --> 00:23:43,079
...for motor skills,
concentration, stamina.

275
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:45,162
I see we have a question.

276
00:23:45,409 --> 00:23:48,845
I'm sorry, maybe you
already answered this but...

277
00:23:49,089 --> 00:23:50,442
...why are we here?

278
00:23:50,689 --> 00:23:51,644
Son.

279
00:23:52,129 --> 00:23:54,927
Lieutenant Jensen.
West Point graduate with honours.

280
00:23:55,169 --> 00:23:58,639
We're here because you want
the best of the best of the best, sir!

281
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,761
What's so funny, Edwards?

282
00:24:06,129 --> 00:24:08,120
Your boy, Captain America, here.

283
00:24:08,729 --> 00:24:11,163
"The best of the best
of the best, sir!"

284
00:24:11,489 --> 00:24:12,285
"With honours."

285
00:24:13,089 --> 00:24:14,647
He's just really excited...

286
00:24:14,849 --> 00:24:16,840
...and has no clue why we're here.

287
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:19,398
That's just very funny to me.

288
00:24:20,769 --> 00:24:22,361
Y'all ain't laughing, though.

289
00:24:29,889 --> 00:24:31,720
Okay, let's get going.

290
00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:54,083
Wanna get down on this?

291
00:26:18,969 --> 00:26:20,561
Edwards, what happened?

292
00:26:21,569 --> 00:26:22,365
Hesitated.

293
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:28,638
May I ask why you felt
little Tiffany deserved to die?

294
00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:31,164
She was the only one
that seemed dangerous.

295
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:32,722
How'd you figure that?

296
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:35,523
I was gonna pop this guy
hanging from the light...

297
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:37,282
...but he's just working out.

298
00:26:37,569 --> 00:26:41,084
How'd I feel if somebody bust
my ass while I'm on the treadmill?

299
00:26:41,329 --> 00:26:43,126
Then I saw this snarling beast.

300
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:46,281
I noticed he had a tissue
in his hand and realized...

301
00:26:46,529 --> 00:26:48,485
...he's not snarling,
he's sneezing.

302
00:26:48,729 --> 00:26:50,003
Ain't no threat there.

303
00:26:50,249 --> 00:26:51,284
Then I saw Tiffany.

304
00:26:51,529 --> 00:26:54,327
8-year-old white girl,
middle of the ghetto...

305
00:26:54,569 --> 00:26:57,288
...bunch of monsters at night
with quantum physics books?

306
00:26:57,569 --> 00:26:59,287
She about to start some shit.

307
00:26:59,489 --> 00:27:01,923
Those books are
way too advanced for her.

308
00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:04,444
If you ask me, she's up to something.

309
00:27:04,729 --> 00:27:07,323
I'd appreciate it if you
eased up about it.

310
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:13,240
Or do I owe her an apology?

311
00:27:20,569 --> 00:27:21,922
Good shot, though, right?

312
00:27:27,249 --> 00:27:29,080
He has a problem with authority.

313
00:27:29,329 --> 00:27:30,557
So do I.

314
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:33,886
But this kid ran down
a cephalopoid on foot, boss.

315
00:27:34,129 --> 00:27:35,881
That's gotta be tough enough.

316
00:27:36,969 --> 00:27:39,085
Let's hope you know what you're doing.

317
00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:49,239
Gentlemen, congratulations.

318
00:27:49,449 --> 00:27:52,839
You're everything we expect
from years of government training.

319
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:56,519
If you'll just follow me,
we have one more test to administer.

320
00:27:56,729 --> 00:27:58,321
An eye exam.

321
00:28:10,729 --> 00:28:11,957
Where are you going?

322
00:28:13,729 --> 00:28:15,162
What the hell is all this?

323
00:28:15,409 --> 00:28:18,401
In the 1950s, the government
started an underfunded agency...

324
00:28:18,649 --> 00:28:21,288
...with the laughable purpose
of establishing contact...

325
00:28:21,489 --> 00:28:23,207
...with a race not of this planet.

326
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:25,479
Look at the end of this device.

327
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:28,607
Everyone thought the agency
was a joke, except the aliens...

328
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:31,807
...who made contact on March 2, 1961
outside New York.

329
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:35,928
There were nine of us the first night.
Seven agents, one astronomer...

330
00:28:36,129 --> 00:28:38,199
...and a dumb kid who'd gotten lost.

331
00:28:38,449 --> 00:28:41,168
You brought that tall man some flowers.

332
00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:42,884
This way.

333
00:28:43,969 --> 00:28:46,199
They were a group
of intergalactic refugees.

334
00:28:46,449 --> 00:28:49,919
Wanted Earth as an apolitical zone
for creatures without a planet.

335
00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:51,648
You ever see Casablanca?

336
00:28:51,889 --> 00:28:53,481
Same thing, except no Nazis.

337
00:28:53,689 --> 00:28:56,886
We agreed and concealed
all evidence of their landing.

338
00:28:57,809 --> 00:29:01,768
So these are real flying saucers
and the World's Fair was a cover-up?

339
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:03,118
Why hold it in Queens?

340
00:29:03,369 --> 00:29:06,167
More nonhumans arrive every year
and live among us in secret.

341
00:29:06,409 --> 00:29:10,960
Not to change the subject, but when
was the last time you got a CAT scan?

342
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:14,724
- Six months ago. It's company policy.
- Make another appointment.

343
00:29:14,969 --> 00:29:18,041
Tell your boy Zed I had
an absolutely wonderful time...

344
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:21,201
...and thank you for everything,
but show me the door.

345
00:29:21,449 --> 00:29:24,407
All right. I'm getting some coffee.
You want some?

346
00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:26,367
No, thank you, I'm fine.

347
00:29:31,529 --> 00:29:32,518
How you doing?

348
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:33,884
Hi, Kay.

349
00:29:35,049 --> 00:29:37,438
- That's not decaf, is it?
- Viennese cinnamon.

350
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:41,603
Don't tell me we only got powdered
stuff for cream. I hate it.

351
00:29:43,489 --> 00:29:45,605
Well, that's good. Good. Good.

352
00:29:46,449 --> 00:29:48,087
You guys getting along all right?

353
00:29:49,649 --> 00:29:51,082
Don't work too hard.

354
00:29:54,769 --> 00:29:56,680
Sure you don't want some coffee?

355
00:30:02,889 --> 00:30:04,322
Here's the deal.

356
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:07,766
At any given time, there are
around 1500 aliens on the planet.

357
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:09,886
Most of them here in Manhattan.

358
00:30:10,129 --> 00:30:12,882
Most of them are decent.
Just trying to make a living.

359
00:30:13,129 --> 00:30:15,484
- Cab drivers?
- Not as many as you'd think.

360
00:30:15,969 --> 00:30:18,961
Humans, for the most part,
don't have a clue. Don't want one.

361
00:30:19,209 --> 00:30:23,487
They're happy. They think
they have a good bead on things.

362
00:30:24,329 --> 00:30:26,718
People are smart.
They can handle it.

363
00:30:27,049 --> 00:30:28,038
A person is smart.

364
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:31,964
People are dumb, panicky,
dangerous animals, and you know it.

365
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:35,321
1500 years ago, everybody knew
the Earth was...

366
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:37,207
...the centre of the universe.

367
00:30:37,449 --> 00:30:40,646
500 years ago, everybody knew
the Earth was flat.

368
00:30:40,889 --> 00:30:44,768
And 15 minutes ago, you knew that
people were alone on this planet.

369
00:30:46,769 --> 00:30:48,725
Imagine what you'll know...

370
00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:50,044
...tomorrow.

371
00:30:52,369 --> 00:30:54,485
- What's the catch?
- The catch?

372
00:30:55,049 --> 00:30:57,438
The catch is, you will sever
all human contact.

373
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,647
Nobody will ever know
you exist anywhere...

374
00:31:02,489 --> 00:31:03,478
...ever.

375
00:31:06,689 --> 00:31:09,078
I'll give you to sunrise
to think it over.

376
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:15,283
Is it worth it?

377
00:31:15,529 --> 00:31:16,848
Yeah, it's worth it.

378
00:31:19,249 --> 00:31:20,807
If you're strong enough.

379
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:19,888
What's up, pops?

380
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:30,959
I'm in...

381
00:32:31,169 --> 00:32:34,366
...because there's some
next-level shit going on here.

382
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:37,686
Before y'all beam me up,
there's a few things to understand.

383
00:32:37,929 --> 00:32:41,524
First off, you chose me,
so you recognize the skills.

384
00:32:41,769 --> 00:32:45,239
I don't want nobody calling me
"son" or "kid" or "sport." Cool?

385
00:32:45,489 --> 00:32:46,683
Cool. Whatever, slick.

386
00:32:46,889 --> 00:32:50,006
But I need to tell you something
about all your skills.

387
00:32:51,249 --> 00:32:52,129
As of right now,
they mean precisely...

388
00:32:52,129 --> 00:32:54,359
As of right now,
they mean precisely...

389
00:32:54,769 --> 00:32:55,997
...dick.

390
00:33:08,689 --> 00:33:11,078
- Purpose of trip?
- Diplomatic mission.

391
00:33:11,329 --> 00:33:12,205
Duration of stay?

392
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:13,677
Lunch.

393
00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:15,681
Any fruits or vegetables?

394
00:33:27,689 --> 00:33:30,044
You wanna stay away from that guy.

395
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:32,562
He's grouchy.

396
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,802
Three hours in customs
after a 17-trillion-mile trip...

397
00:33:36,009 --> 00:33:37,442
...will make anyone cranky.

398
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:39,480
What government branch
do we report to?

399
00:33:39,729 --> 00:33:42,197
- None. They ask too many questions.
- Who pays for this?

400
00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:46,687
We hold patents on a few gadgets we
confiscated from out-of-state visitors.

401
00:33:46,929 --> 00:33:48,999
Velcro, microwave ovens, liposuction.

402
00:33:49,209 --> 00:33:51,006
This is a fascinating gadget.

403
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,919
It'll replace CDs soon. I'll have to
buy the White Album again.

404
00:33:55,169 --> 00:33:59,128
That's fun. A universal translator.
We're not even supposed to have it.

405
00:33:59,369 --> 00:34:01,837
Human thought is so primitive.
It's looked upon...

406
00:34:02,089 --> 00:34:04,523
...as an infectious disease
in some galaxies.

407
00:34:04,769 --> 00:34:06,521
That kind of makes you proud.

408
00:34:06,769 --> 00:34:07,804
What's this?

409
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:12,683
Just be calm!

410
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:13,918
Relax!

411
00:34:14,609 --> 00:34:15,883
Watch your head!

412
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:18,007
Someone get him some ice!

413
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:21,801
Look out! Move! Just move
when it's coming at you!

414
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:28,565
Damn!

415
00:34:29,289 --> 00:34:30,802
I'll pay for that!

416
00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:44,641
This thing caused
the 1977 New York blackout.

417
00:34:45,569 --> 00:34:47,605
Practical joke
by the Great Attractor.

418
00:34:47,849 --> 00:34:49,407
He thought it was funny.

419
00:34:50,729 --> 00:34:51,957
Sorry, y'all.

420
00:34:52,609 --> 00:34:54,645
It was a accident. Sorry.

421
00:34:55,169 --> 00:34:57,160
Observation,
the heart of our endeavour.

422
00:34:57,409 --> 00:34:59,479
Meet the twins, Blblup and Bob.

423
00:34:59,729 --> 00:35:02,926
This map shows the location
of every alien on Earth.

424
00:35:03,169 --> 00:35:05,080
Some are under constant surveillance.

425
00:35:05,449 --> 00:35:07,440
Everyone on those screens is an alien.

426
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:10,442
In public, they're as normal
as you are, but in private...

427
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:11,964
You'll get the idea.

428
00:35:13,129 --> 00:35:14,448
Oh, man.

429
00:35:14,889 --> 00:35:16,447
Doesn't make any sense, right?

430
00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:20,169
Well, no, it makes perfect sense.

431
00:35:20,689 --> 00:35:23,840
In third grade, everyone said
I was crazy, but I knew our teacher...

432
00:35:24,049 --> 00:35:26,199
...had to be from Venus or something.

433
00:35:26,409 --> 00:35:29,048
Ms. Edelson. Jupiter, actually.
Well, one of the moons.

434
00:35:30,409 --> 00:35:31,239
- Revolve.

435
00:35:31,489 --> 00:35:32,763
Class...

436
00:35:33,209 --> 00:35:35,484
...be quiet and pay attention!

437
00:35:36,409 --> 00:35:37,967
If I have to tell you...

438
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:40,444
...one more time...

439
00:35:42,089 --> 00:35:43,238
Let's put it on.

440
00:35:44,049 --> 00:35:44,845
Put what on?

441
00:35:45,449 --> 00:35:47,838
The last suit you'll ever wear.

442
00:35:59,849 --> 00:36:02,443
You will dress only in attire
specially sanctioned...

443
00:36:02,689 --> 00:36:04,600
...by MiB Special Services.

444
00:36:05,089 --> 00:36:07,762
You'll conform to
the identity we give you...

445
00:36:08,009 --> 00:36:10,682
...eat where we tell you,
live where we tell you.

446
00:36:11,289 --> 00:36:12,199
From now on...

447
00:36:12,449 --> 00:36:14,838
...you'll have no identifying
marks of any kind.

448
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,603
You will not stand out in any way.

449
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,806
Your entire image is crafted...

450
00:36:20,049 --> 00:36:22,847
...to leave no lasting memory
with anyone you meet.

451
00:36:23,169 --> 00:36:25,478
You are a rumour,
recognizable only as...

452
00:36:25,689 --> 00:36:28,442
...déjà vu and dismissed
just as quickly.

453
00:36:28,689 --> 00:36:30,919
You don't exist.
You were never born.

454
00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:35,446
Anonymity is your name.

455
00:36:35,689 --> 00:36:37,486
Silence, your native tongue.

456
00:36:38,249 --> 00:36:40,444
You're no longer part of the system.

457
00:36:40,649 --> 00:36:42,719
You are above the system. Over it.

458
00:36:43,209 --> 00:36:44,688
Beyond it.

459
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:47,879
We're "them." We're "they."

460
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:50,604
We are the Men in Black.

461
00:36:57,649 --> 00:37:00,607
You know what the difference is
between you and me?

462
00:37:03,049 --> 00:37:04,926
I make this look good.

463
00:37:07,009 --> 00:37:08,886
We're gonna go for a little ride.

464
00:37:09,289 --> 00:37:12,804
I'll put you down here for a minute,
and Daddy will be right back.

465
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,722
Okay, now we're ready to go
for a little ride.

466
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:49,405
We'll meet one of Daddy's friends,
and you'll like him.

467
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:54,206
Okay, let's see.

468
00:37:54,849 --> 00:37:58,159
Bee, we got the deposed sur-prefect
of Singalee...

469
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:01,207
...touching down in the forest
outside Portland tonight.

470
00:38:01,449 --> 00:38:03,963
- Humanoid?
- You wish. Bring a sponge.

471
00:38:05,129 --> 00:38:07,120
Here. Red letter from last night.

472
00:38:07,809 --> 00:38:10,642
We had an unauthorized landing
in upstate New York.

473
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:12,800
Keep your ears open
on this one.

474
00:38:13,009 --> 00:38:16,285
We're not hosting an
intergalactic kegger down here.

475
00:38:18,089 --> 00:38:19,488
We got a skimmer.

476
00:38:19,849 --> 00:38:21,680
Landed alien out of zone.
Who is it?

477
00:38:21,929 --> 00:38:22,918
Redgick.

478
00:38:23,169 --> 00:38:26,047
He's not cleared to leave Manhattan,
but he's out of town...

479
00:38:26,289 --> 00:38:28,245
...stuck on the New Jersey turnpike.

480
00:38:28,489 --> 00:38:30,127
Take junior with you.

481
00:38:30,369 --> 00:38:33,042
This is a good one
for him to warm up on.

482
00:38:33,609 --> 00:38:34,564
Go get him, tiger.

483
00:38:41,249 --> 00:38:43,809
"We're not hosting
an intergalactic kegger."

484
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:46,238
Zed...

485
00:38:47,169 --> 00:38:48,284
He just...

486
00:38:49,809 --> 00:38:53,597
Unlimited technology from the
whole universe, and we cruise around...

487
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:55,208
...in a Ford POS.

488
00:38:57,649 --> 00:38:59,401
Fasten your seat belt.

489
00:38:59,649 --> 00:39:01,401
We gotta work on your people skills.

490
00:39:01,649 --> 00:39:04,243
You'd get a better reaction
if you were polite.

491
00:39:04,489 --> 00:39:06,047
Fasten your seat belt, please.

492
00:39:06,249 --> 00:39:07,807
Good. Did you hurt yourself?

493
00:39:11,489 --> 00:39:15,004
The red button there, kid.
Don't ever touch the red button.

494
00:39:24,609 --> 00:39:27,169
All right, pop,
that'll be $72 there.

495
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:30,841
Okay, sweetie, let me pay
the impolite driver.

496
00:39:59,409 --> 00:40:03,482
Sorry I'm late. The cab drivers
on this planet are terrible.

497
00:40:03,729 --> 00:40:06,004
Your Majesty,
you are in grave danger.

498
00:40:06,249 --> 00:40:09,127
Yeah, and they overcharge
you every time.

499
00:40:09,369 --> 00:40:13,044
Sir, a bug landed here.
We must get you off the planet.

500
00:40:13,289 --> 00:40:15,405
A bug? He must know
why I'm here.

501
00:40:15,649 --> 00:40:17,082
We think he does.

502
00:40:18,569 --> 00:40:20,241
Is that what I think it is?

503
00:40:20,489 --> 00:40:22,878
No, just some diamonds
for your children.

504
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,278
Do we have time to eat?

505
00:40:25,049 --> 00:40:28,280
Sure. I ordered you
some Pirogi.

506
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:32,802
Six is up!

507
00:40:34,089 --> 00:40:35,078
Where is lvan?

508
00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:36,762
Gave him a break.

509
00:40:47,009 --> 00:40:49,921
To the continued reign of
the Arquillian Empire.

510
00:40:50,169 --> 00:40:52,046
To the safety of the Galaxy.

511
00:40:59,049 --> 00:41:01,961
You can kill us both,
but you will not find the Galaxy.

512
00:41:02,889 --> 00:41:04,959
You're right about one thing.

513
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:20,327
You're not going anywhere.

514
00:41:36,649 --> 00:41:38,719
Your licence and registration, please.

515
00:41:42,289 --> 00:41:45,281
Like to see your other licence
and registration, please.

516
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:55,684
You're restricted to Manhattan.
Where are you going, Redgie?

517
00:41:56,449 --> 00:41:58,883
It's my wife. She's...
Well, look.

518
00:42:03,489 --> 00:42:04,604
No big deal.

519
00:42:04,849 --> 00:42:06,885
Okay, you come with me, Redge.

520
00:42:08,969 --> 00:42:10,960
And you handle this.

521
00:42:11,209 --> 00:42:12,039
What?! Me?

522
00:42:12,769 --> 00:42:15,044
- You just catch.
- Does he know what he's doing?

523
00:42:15,249 --> 00:42:17,240
He does it all the time.
Let him work.

524
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:27,281
Damn, man!

525
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:30,649
Something's peeking!

526
00:42:30,889 --> 00:42:32,766
You're headed out of town.

527
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:35,204
- We're meeting someone.
- Who?

528
00:42:35,449 --> 00:42:38,327
- It's a ship.
- I saw no departure clearance.

529
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:39,399
You didn't?

530
00:42:39,649 --> 00:42:41,799
It's an emergency.

531
00:42:42,369 --> 00:42:43,643
You're doing fine!

532
00:42:43,849 --> 00:42:47,808
What kind of emergency?
What's the rush to get off the planet?

533
00:42:48,129 --> 00:42:50,199
We don't like
the neighbourhood anymore.

534
00:42:50,449 --> 00:42:52,201
Some of the new arrivals...

535
00:42:52,449 --> 00:42:55,646
New arrivals? Have anything to do
with the crasher last night?

536
00:42:55,849 --> 00:42:57,168
Excuse me, miss!

537
00:43:00,689 --> 00:43:02,088
Oh, man.

538
00:43:02,649 --> 00:43:04,287
Oh, man!

539
00:43:06,249 --> 00:43:07,125
Look.

540
00:43:07,369 --> 00:43:09,087
Oh, man!

541
00:43:10,569 --> 00:43:12,639
Congratulations, Redge.
It's a...

542
00:43:13,489 --> 00:43:14,808
...squid.

543
00:43:18,049 --> 00:43:18,925
You know, it's...

544
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:21,720
...actually kind of...

545
00:43:27,809 --> 00:43:28,924
...cute.

546
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:38,559
Anything about that seem unusual?

547
00:43:41,089 --> 00:43:42,602
What would scare Redgick so badly...

548
00:43:42,849 --> 00:43:45,204
...that he'd risk a warp jump
with a newborn?

549
00:43:45,649 --> 00:43:47,480
We'll check the hot sheets.

550
00:43:52,889 --> 00:43:54,038
These are "hot sheets"?

551
00:43:54,249 --> 00:43:56,205
Best investigative reporting on Earth.

552
00:43:56,449 --> 00:43:59,407
Read The New York Times if you want.
They get lucky sometimes.

553
00:43:59,769 --> 00:44:03,318
Cannot believe you're looking for tips
in the supermarket tabloids.

554
00:44:04,769 --> 00:44:06,202
Not "looking for."

555
00:44:07,049 --> 00:44:09,609
Found.

556
00:44:21,809 --> 00:44:24,084
- Wait a minute, slow down.
- Why?

557
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:27,401
Give her time to get the wrong
impression. Makes it smoother.

558
00:44:28,489 --> 00:44:29,842
Can I help you?

559
00:44:30,089 --> 00:44:33,240
Yes, ma'am. I'm Agent Manheim,
this is Agent Black, FBI.

560
00:44:33,489 --> 00:44:35,127
We'd like to talk about your visitor.

561
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:36,722
Gonna make fun of me too?

562
00:44:36,969 --> 00:44:40,882
No, we do not have a sense of humour
we're aware of. May we come in?

563
00:44:42,569 --> 00:44:43,399
Sure.

564
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:44,998
- Thank you.
- Lemonade?

565
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:46,602
Oh, yes, please.

566
00:44:51,049 --> 00:44:53,358
The chief of police came
to the house...

567
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:55,486
...and did an investigation.

568
00:44:55,969 --> 00:44:58,961
Took a police report and writ down
everything I said...

569
00:44:59,209 --> 00:45:00,927
...not believing one thing I said.

570
00:45:01,169 --> 00:45:02,807
Sort of poking fun at me.

571
00:45:03,049 --> 00:45:05,040
He asked me, " If he was murdered...

572
00:45:05,289 --> 00:45:07,598
...how was he able to walk
back in the house?"

573
00:45:07,849 --> 00:45:10,568
I gotta admit to you that
that one got me stumped.

574
00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:13,403
I tell you, I know Edgar,
and that wasn't Edgar.

575
00:45:14,889 --> 00:45:17,722
It was like something was
wearing Edgar.

576
00:45:19,649 --> 00:45:20,843
Like a suit...

577
00:45:21,449 --> 00:45:22,802
...an Edgar suit.

578
00:45:30,089 --> 00:45:32,683
Dude was that ugly
before he was an alien.

579
00:45:35,489 --> 00:45:37,241
I'm sorry.

580
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:38,598
Go on.

581
00:45:39,569 --> 00:45:40,684
Anyway...

582
00:45:40,929 --> 00:45:42,885
...I come to and he's gone.

583
00:45:43,889 --> 00:45:44,799
He say anything?

584
00:45:45,129 --> 00:45:47,848
Yes. He asked me for some water.

585
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:50,201
Some sugar water.

586
00:45:50,569 --> 00:45:51,604
Sugar water?

587
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:54,727
I remember that right.
I thought that that was odd...

588
00:45:55,089 --> 00:45:59,002
...that he asked me for sugar water
and not lemonade or ice water...

589
00:45:59,409 --> 00:46:00,603
...or regular water...

590
00:46:00,849 --> 00:46:02,043
...tap water.

591
00:46:03,089 --> 00:46:05,649
All right, Beatrice.
There was no alien.

592
00:46:05,889 --> 00:46:08,084
The flash of light was not a U.F.O.

593
00:46:08,329 --> 00:46:12,447
Gas was trapped in a thermal pocket
and refracted the light from Venus.

594
00:46:12,689 --> 00:46:13,883
Wait a minute.

595
00:46:14,129 --> 00:46:17,405
That thing erases her memory,
and you just make up a new one?

596
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,207
A standard-issue neuralizer.

597
00:46:19,449 --> 00:46:22,043
That weak-ass story is
the best you came up with?

598
00:46:22,369 --> 00:46:24,803
All right. On a more personal note...

599
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:28,883
...Edgar ran off with an old girlfriend.
You'll stay with your mama...

600
00:46:29,129 --> 00:46:30,448
...and decide you're better off.

601
00:46:30,689 --> 00:46:34,204
Yeah, because he never
appreciated you anyway.

602
00:46:34,769 --> 00:46:36,600
In fact, you know what?

603
00:46:36,849 --> 00:46:39,443
You kicked him out.
And now that he's gone...

604
00:46:39,689 --> 00:46:42,681
...you'll go in town,
find yourself some nice dresses.

605
00:46:42,929 --> 00:46:46,808
Get yourself some shoes.
Find somewhere you could get a facial.

606
00:46:48,329 --> 00:46:51,480
And hire a decorator to come
in here quick because... damn!

607
00:46:59,289 --> 00:47:01,007
When do I get my own flashy...

608
00:47:01,249 --> 00:47:02,568
...memory messer-upper?

609
00:47:02,809 --> 00:47:03,764
When you grow up.

610
00:47:07,729 --> 00:47:08,639
Please. Not green.

611
00:47:10,089 --> 00:47:10,999
Oh, damn!

612
00:47:12,689 --> 00:47:15,408
Do you know which alien leaves
a green spectral trail...

613
00:47:15,649 --> 00:47:16,923
...and craves sugar water?

614
00:47:17,889 --> 00:47:21,564
That was on Jeopardy last night.
Damn, Alex said it was...

615
00:47:21,809 --> 00:47:23,561
Zed, we have a bug.

616
00:47:24,249 --> 00:47:26,888
So...
What? We don't like bugs?

617
00:47:27,129 --> 00:47:29,199
Bugs thrive on carnage, tiger.

618
00:47:29,649 --> 00:47:33,801
They consume, infest, destroy,
live off the death of other species.

619
00:47:34,049 --> 00:47:36,005
You were stung as a child, right?

620
00:47:36,609 --> 00:47:40,079
Lmagine a giant cockroach
with unlimited strength...

621
00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:43,765
...a massive inferiority complex,
and a real short temper...

622
00:47:43,969 --> 00:47:47,120
...is terrorizing Manhattan Island
in a new Edgar suit.

623
00:47:48,249 --> 00:47:49,318
That sound like fun?

624
00:47:51,649 --> 00:47:52,684
What's the move?

625
00:47:53,809 --> 00:47:56,164
With a bug in town,
we'll watch the morgues.

626
00:48:08,009 --> 00:48:09,761
Where do you want
contestant number 3?

627
00:48:09,969 --> 00:48:11,402
Just leave it there.

628
00:48:11,649 --> 00:48:12,684
What's with the cat?

629
00:48:12,929 --> 00:48:15,841
There's a problem with the cat.
Sign here.

630
00:48:16,089 --> 00:48:18,762
- What's the problem with the cat?
- It's your problem.

631
00:48:21,969 --> 00:48:23,448
I hate the living.

632
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:26,688
Shall we?

633
00:48:55,129 --> 00:48:56,926
Oh, my God!

634
00:49:00,849 --> 00:49:02,760
Buddy, what are you?

635
00:49:10,809 --> 00:49:13,926
Subject was approximately 112 degrees
at time of autopsy...

636
00:49:14,169 --> 00:49:16,239
...indicating a temperature increase.

637
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:20,448
Examiner tried to verify this rectally,
but the subject had no rectum.

638
00:49:20,689 --> 00:49:22,042
Which is really...

639
00:49:22,289 --> 00:49:23,119
Weird.

640
00:49:23,969 --> 00:49:27,962
I'm Dr. Leo Manville, Department
of Public Health. This is Dr. White.

641
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:30,925
You must not have a home life.

642
00:49:31,129 --> 00:49:34,246
We watch the morgues carefully.
You have something unusual?

643
00:49:34,489 --> 00:49:36,684
I'd say so. Triple homicide.

644
00:49:36,929 --> 00:49:38,729
The first body was normal,
except he was broken in half.

645
00:49:38,729 --> 00:49:39,957
The first body was normal,
except he was broken in half.

646
00:49:40,209 --> 00:49:42,598
But when I opened up
the other two, well...

647
00:49:42,849 --> 00:49:43,759
Let me show you.

648
00:49:50,409 --> 00:49:53,401
There's a skeletal structure
unlike anything I've seen.

649
00:49:53,649 --> 00:49:55,048
I'll have a look at it.

650
00:49:55,249 --> 00:49:57,365
You and Dr. Weaver
check the other body.

651
00:49:57,569 --> 00:49:58,888
This way, doctor.

652
00:49:59,569 --> 00:50:01,366
This one's even stranger.

653
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,809
I did a laparotomy.
I started with the stomach.

654
00:50:05,049 --> 00:50:08,359
But we can start with the
gastroesophageal junction.

655
00:50:09,449 --> 00:50:12,247
Let's start wherever you started at.

656
00:50:12,689 --> 00:50:13,963
Okey-dokey.

657
00:50:22,329 --> 00:50:23,842
- Is this your cat?
- It is now.

658
00:50:24,049 --> 00:50:26,324
It came in with the body.
Dive right in.

659
00:50:26,529 --> 00:50:28,167
I'm sure he won't mind.

660
00:50:31,649 --> 00:50:33,446
You have really pretty eyes.

661
00:50:34,409 --> 00:50:35,364
Thank you.

662
00:50:39,049 --> 00:50:39,925
Feel that?

663
00:50:40,129 --> 00:50:43,041
Where the pyloric junction would be?
Push it aside.

664
00:50:43,529 --> 00:50:46,407
Notice anything strange?
Stomach, liver, lungs...

665
00:50:46,809 --> 00:50:48,606
Nope, all fine.

666
00:50:48,849 --> 00:50:50,282
They're all missing.

667
00:50:51,009 --> 00:50:51,839
Of course.

668
00:50:52,089 --> 00:50:54,922
That's obviously
the first thing I noticed.

669
00:50:55,449 --> 00:50:58,327
What I was pointing out
is the fact that there are no...

670
00:50:59,449 --> 00:51:00,723
...pieces...

671
00:51:00,969 --> 00:51:02,402
...of them left.

672
00:51:02,649 --> 00:51:05,561
You know, so they're intact...

673
00:51:06,009 --> 00:51:09,001
...wherever they are whole.
That we can be sure of.

674
00:51:09,209 --> 00:51:10,562
Have we met before?

675
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:13,360
I'm having a feeling of déjá vu.

676
00:51:14,809 --> 00:51:17,039
- Yeah, me too.
- Really?

677
00:51:17,809 --> 00:51:20,164
Wanna know what I think?
Don't tell him.

678
00:51:20,409 --> 00:51:23,606
He's under enough stress.
I don't think it's a real body.

679
00:51:23,849 --> 00:51:27,046
I think it's some kind of
transport unit for something else.

680
00:51:27,289 --> 00:51:29,041
The question is, what?

681
00:51:29,889 --> 00:51:31,368
Is this freaking you out?

682
00:51:34,249 --> 00:51:35,398
No, girl.

683
00:51:36,929 --> 00:51:39,762
You know what I like to do sometimes
when it's late?

684
00:51:43,929 --> 00:51:45,203
Dr. White.

685
00:51:46,889 --> 00:51:48,163
Excuse me.

686
00:51:52,689 --> 00:51:53,804
What do you think?

687
00:51:54,329 --> 00:51:57,401
Interesting. She got
a "Queen of the Undead" thing going...

688
00:51:57,649 --> 00:51:58,877
Of the body.

689
00:51:59,089 --> 00:51:59,885
Great body.

690
00:52:00,089 --> 00:52:01,727
The dead body.

691
00:52:02,489 --> 00:52:04,366
You have to look at that thing.

692
00:52:04,689 --> 00:52:06,042
You recognize him?

693
00:52:06,729 --> 00:52:10,085
He looks like the big guy I saw
at headquarters, only deader.

694
00:52:10,329 --> 00:52:11,603
What killed him?

695
00:52:12,849 --> 00:52:13,759
A bug?

696
00:52:14,609 --> 00:52:15,837
You're up, slugger.

697
00:52:19,729 --> 00:52:20,878
Look at this.

698
00:52:22,609 --> 00:52:23,962
What the hell is that?

699
00:52:41,769 --> 00:52:43,122
Must...

700
00:52:44,729 --> 00:52:46,606
To prevent...

701
00:52:48,969 --> 00:52:50,800
...contest.

702
00:52:51,809 --> 00:52:53,208
What are you saying?

703
00:52:53,449 --> 00:52:54,802
To prevent...

704
00:52:55,049 --> 00:52:56,482
To prevent...

705
00:52:56,769 --> 00:52:57,758
...struggle?

706
00:53:00,089 --> 00:53:01,078
To prevent...

707
00:53:01,609 --> 00:53:02,485
War?

708
00:53:02,849 --> 00:53:03,998
War.

709
00:53:06,489 --> 00:53:07,968
The Galaxy...

710
00:53:09,289 --> 00:53:10,961
...is on...

711
00:53:11,369 --> 00:53:13,200
...Orion's...

712
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:16,405
...be...

713
00:53:19,209 --> 00:53:20,608
What is word?

714
00:53:21,209 --> 00:53:22,483
The bed?

715
00:53:22,969 --> 00:53:24,880
Belt? Orion's belt?

716
00:53:44,329 --> 00:53:47,560
"To prevent war, the Galaxy
is on Orion's belt."

717
00:53:47,809 --> 00:53:49,640
What the hell does that mean?

718
00:53:52,969 --> 00:53:54,402
Doctor...

719
00:53:54,609 --> 00:53:55,883
...whatever, come here.

720
00:53:56,129 --> 00:53:59,963
Dr. Whatever? You guys aren't really
from the Department of Health.

721
00:54:00,249 --> 00:54:02,001
Rosenberg. Damn!

722
00:54:02,249 --> 00:54:06,401
The Arquillians won't like this.
He was one of the royal family.

723
00:54:06,689 --> 00:54:07,838
This is an alien...

724
00:54:08,049 --> 00:54:11,246
...and you're from a government agency
keeping it under wraps.

725
00:54:11,449 --> 00:54:14,566
He said, "To prevent war,
the Galaxy is on Orion's belt."

726
00:54:14,809 --> 00:54:16,925
How else do you explain New York?

727
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:19,404
I was in this cab, and this guy was...

728
00:54:21,209 --> 00:54:23,245
"Galaxy on Orion's belt"
makes no sense.

729
00:54:23,449 --> 00:54:27,237
That's what the little dude inside
the big dude's head said, right?

730
00:54:27,449 --> 00:54:30,282
Damn, man!
You did the flashy thing already.

731
00:54:30,529 --> 00:54:32,997
Whoever you are,
you'll have to show me I.D.

732
00:54:33,249 --> 00:54:36,161
Of course, young lady.
Look at this for me, please.

733
00:54:36,409 --> 00:54:38,161
- Would you stop that?
- What?

734
00:54:38,369 --> 00:54:40,405
That thing will give her brain cancer.

735
00:54:40,649 --> 00:54:42,799
Never hurt her before.
Close the doors.

736
00:54:43,049 --> 00:54:44,767
Special Services will be here.

737
00:54:45,009 --> 00:54:47,762
How many times have you
flashy-thinged that woman?

738
00:54:48,009 --> 00:54:48,805
Couple.

739
00:54:49,049 --> 00:54:52,166
- Don't you worry about long-term damage?
- A little.

740
00:54:52,409 --> 00:54:54,240
- Have you flashy-thinged me?
- No.

741
00:54:54,489 --> 00:54:56,844
I ain't playing with you! Have you?

742
00:55:06,089 --> 00:55:09,001
I think I should be in charge
of the flashy thing.

743
00:55:09,249 --> 00:55:10,602
Not while I'm around.

744
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,965
You'll fricassee someone's brain.

745
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:17,043
We got two dead aliens and
a medical examiner needs a new memory.

746
00:55:19,529 --> 00:55:21,759
Make it a happy memory.

747
00:55:53,649 --> 00:55:55,640
Where is it?!

748
00:56:37,649 --> 00:56:39,048
Hey, Zed.

749
00:56:39,569 --> 00:56:42,242
Doesn't anybody ever get
any sleep around here?

750
00:56:42,489 --> 00:56:46,243
The twins keep us on Centurian time.
It's a 37-hour day.

751
00:56:46,449 --> 00:56:48,599
Give it a few months.
You'll get used to it.

752
00:56:48,849 --> 00:56:50,407
Or have a psychotic episode.

753
00:56:50,889 --> 00:56:51,958
Here's Orion.

754
00:56:52,169 --> 00:56:55,047
It's a grouping of the brightest stars
in the northern sky.

755
00:56:55,289 --> 00:56:57,757
- Here's Orion's belt.
- The little guy said:

756
00:56:58,009 --> 00:57:01,206
"To prevent war, the Galaxy
is on Orion's belt."

757
00:57:01,449 --> 00:57:03,599
There are no galaxies
on Orion's belt.

758
00:57:03,849 --> 00:57:07,398
The belt is just these three stars.
Galaxies are huge.

759
00:57:07,609 --> 00:57:11,568
They're made up of billions of stars.
You heard wrong.

760
00:57:12,409 --> 00:57:14,764
Look, whatever, I know what I heard.

761
00:57:50,369 --> 00:57:51,643
Pretty lady.

762
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:02,240
That grumpy guy's story's starting to
come into focus a little bit here.

763
00:58:02,929 --> 00:58:06,001
So you were the guy in that picture
with the flowers?

764
00:58:06,929 --> 00:58:10,126
And, I take it,
she never got those flowers.

765
00:58:10,809 --> 00:58:13,562
So, what, she ever get married
or anything?

766
00:58:14,729 --> 00:58:17,527
They say it's better to have
loved and lost...

767
00:58:17,729 --> 00:58:19,765
...than never to have loved at all.

768
00:58:20,009 --> 00:58:21,044
Try it.

769
00:58:26,489 --> 00:58:27,558
Look at this.

770
00:58:27,809 --> 00:58:29,208
They're all leaving.

771
00:58:29,449 --> 00:58:33,203
We've had 12 jumps in the last hour.
Redgick was just the first.

772
00:58:34,049 --> 00:58:35,767
What do they know that we don't?

773
00:58:36,009 --> 00:58:37,488
Why does a rat desert a ship?

774
00:58:37,689 --> 00:58:41,364
Give me Lem Sat 4, please,
with a proton induction thermoscan.

775
00:58:43,129 --> 00:58:45,279
Thank you. Okay. Lem Sat 18.

776
00:58:47,329 --> 00:58:48,478
All right, 4000.

777
00:58:52,689 --> 00:58:54,088
An Arquillian battle cruiser.

778
00:58:54,329 --> 00:58:56,889
And we've got
a dead Arquillian prince.

779
00:58:58,609 --> 00:59:00,042
Speak of the devil.

780
00:59:01,049 --> 00:59:01,925
They sound pissed.

781
00:59:02,169 --> 00:59:03,568
Translate that. Step on it.

782
00:59:03,929 --> 00:59:07,285
Go to Rosenberg's jewellery store,
and see what you can turn up.

783
00:59:13,009 --> 00:59:14,203
Give the kid a weapon.

784
00:59:23,649 --> 00:59:26,766
- Series 4 De-atomizer.
- That's what I'm talking about.

785
00:59:26,969 --> 00:59:28,561
Noisy Cricket.

786
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:32,520
Kay, no, no, come on, man.

787
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:35,124
You get a Series 4 De-atomizer...

788
00:59:35,369 --> 00:59:37,166
...I get a little midget Cricket?

789
00:59:41,009 --> 00:59:42,840
Feel like I'm gonna break it.

790
01:00:25,449 --> 01:00:27,644
Hey, this is my truck!

791
01:00:28,689 --> 01:00:31,681
Make sure you tell them that
down at the impound.

792
01:00:38,729 --> 01:00:40,606
Please.

793
01:00:49,649 --> 01:00:52,004
Who breaks into a jewellery store
and leaves the jewels?

794
01:00:52,249 --> 01:00:54,319
Somebody not looking for jewellery.

795
01:00:56,489 --> 01:00:58,844
This guy had a serious crush
on his cat.

796
01:01:01,369 --> 01:01:02,245
Get down!

797
01:01:07,369 --> 01:01:08,358
Man!

798
01:01:10,169 --> 01:01:12,000
That's him. That's the bug!

799
01:01:12,209 --> 01:01:13,528
In the Edgar suit!

800
01:01:34,329 --> 01:01:36,968
We do not discharge our weapons
in view of the public!

801
01:01:37,209 --> 01:01:39,086
We ain't got time for this bullshit!

802
01:01:39,329 --> 01:01:41,604
There's a alien battle cruiser
about to...

803
01:01:41,849 --> 01:01:44,602
There's always an alien battle
cruiser or a death ray...

804
01:01:44,849 --> 01:01:47,568
...or an intergalactic plague
about to wipe out life on Earth.

805
01:01:47,809 --> 01:01:50,607
The only way people get on
with their happy lives...

806
01:01:50,809 --> 01:01:53,403
...is they do not know about it!

807
01:01:57,969 --> 01:01:59,800
And don't worry about the bug.

808
01:02:00,089 --> 01:02:02,364
He's not leaving town.
We got his ship.

809
01:02:09,889 --> 01:02:11,800
We need a containment crew...

810
01:02:12,009 --> 01:02:13,601
...on MacDougal Street.

811
01:02:14,409 --> 01:02:17,879
Containment may be a moot point.
The exodus continues.

812
01:02:18,129 --> 01:02:21,804
The party's over, and the last one
to leave gets stuck with the check.

813
01:02:22,049 --> 01:02:24,404
You sorry little ingrates!

814
01:02:32,169 --> 01:02:33,761
What about the Arquillians?

815
01:02:34,009 --> 01:02:37,285
We've translated part of the message:
"Deliver the Galaxy."

816
01:02:37,529 --> 01:02:40,601
- They don't want much, do they?
- Oh, it gets better.

817
01:02:40,849 --> 01:02:42,248
They hold us responsible.

818
01:02:50,849 --> 01:02:52,760
Where do you keep your dead?

819
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:54,687
I don't have any dead.

820
01:02:55,209 --> 01:02:56,244
Where?

821
01:02:56,489 --> 01:02:57,763
I don't know.

822
01:02:58,249 --> 01:03:00,160
The city morgue?

823
01:03:09,769 --> 01:03:12,078
That's three for a dollar, sir!

824
01:03:12,649 --> 01:03:15,482
It was some light
that refracted off of Venus...

825
01:03:15,729 --> 01:03:17,128
...into some swamp gas...

826
01:03:17,369 --> 01:03:18,802
...and that's what made the...

827
01:03:19,049 --> 01:03:20,402
All right, kid!

828
01:03:21,169 --> 01:03:22,522
Excuse me.
What's up?

829
01:03:22,769 --> 01:03:25,329
The Arquillians want the Galaxy,
whatever that means.

830
01:03:25,529 --> 01:03:27,281
We need help, a professional...

831
01:03:27,529 --> 01:03:30,566
...with years of experience
in intergalactic politics.

832
01:03:30,809 --> 01:03:33,369
I hope the little twerp
hasn't skipped town.

833
01:03:35,649 --> 01:03:37,401
If you'll gather over here...

834
01:03:37,649 --> 01:03:40,880
That's right, move in closer.
That's good. Thanks.

835
01:03:41,129 --> 01:03:44,439
If you look right here,
I'd appreciate it. Thank you.

836
01:03:56,969 --> 01:03:59,608
The worst disguise ever.
He's definitely an alien.

837
01:03:59,849 --> 01:04:02,522
You don't like it,
you can kiss my furry butt.

838
01:04:03,169 --> 01:04:03,999
Busy, Frank?

839
01:04:04,249 --> 01:04:06,285
Can't talk now.
My flight's leaving in...

840
01:04:06,529 --> 01:04:07,518
Get your paws off!

841
01:04:07,729 --> 01:04:08,878
Call the pound!

842
01:04:09,129 --> 01:04:11,120
The dog owes my friend money.

843
01:04:11,369 --> 01:04:12,882
Arquillians and bugs,
what do you know?

844
01:04:13,129 --> 01:04:14,323
- Nothing.
- Not a thing?

845
01:04:17,129 --> 01:04:19,563
Stop, stop, stop it!
Okay, okay!

846
01:04:19,929 --> 01:04:21,999
Rosenberg wasn't a two-bit Arquillian.

847
01:04:22,209 --> 01:04:25,406
He was the guardian of the Galaxy.
He thought he'd be safe on Earth.

848
01:04:25,649 --> 01:04:26,559
The bug had other plans.

849
01:04:26,769 --> 01:04:30,478
The Galaxy is the best source
for subatomic energy in the universe.

850
01:04:30,729 --> 01:04:33,368
If the bugs get it,
kiss the Arquillians goodbye.

851
01:04:33,609 --> 01:04:34,598
Ask about the belt.

852
01:04:34,849 --> 01:04:37,409
Rosenberg mentioned Orion's belt.
What did he mean?

853
01:04:37,649 --> 01:04:39,367
- Beats me.
- Beats you?

854
01:04:40,129 --> 01:04:41,244
Not around.

855
01:04:44,049 --> 01:04:46,005
It's a ventriloquist act.

856
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:48,046
The Galaxy is here!

857
01:04:48,849 --> 01:04:49,645
Here?

858
01:04:49,849 --> 01:04:52,317
A galaxy's millions of stars
and planets.

859
01:04:52,569 --> 01:04:54,958
When will you learn
that size doesn't matter?

860
01:04:55,409 --> 01:04:58,321
If something's important,
it doesn't mean it's not small.

861
01:04:58,649 --> 01:04:59,604
How small?

862
01:04:59,809 --> 01:05:01,800
The size of a marble or a jewel.

863
01:05:02,289 --> 01:05:04,849
Excuse me. I gotta be walked
before my flight.

864
01:05:05,089 --> 01:05:05,919
Get out of here.

865
01:05:08,369 --> 01:05:11,600
If the Galaxy's here,
it's not on Orion's belt.

866
01:05:31,049 --> 01:05:33,005
When you want attention...

867
01:05:34,409 --> 01:05:35,205
Orion.

868
01:05:35,409 --> 01:05:37,081
That's a pretty name.

869
01:05:37,609 --> 01:05:39,088
What's this?

870
01:06:31,329 --> 01:06:33,365
Yes, good, thank you.

871
01:06:33,609 --> 01:06:36,567
Thank you for making sure
the bell works.

872
01:06:39,169 --> 01:06:40,807
What's up, Farmer John?

873
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:44,757
A man came in here earlier.

874
01:06:45,329 --> 01:06:46,125
A dead man.

875
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:48,246
And that means what to me?

876
01:06:50,209 --> 01:06:52,962
It was a very dear friend of mine.

877
01:06:53,649 --> 01:06:55,640
I believe he had an animal with him.

878
01:06:55,889 --> 01:06:58,323
It was a gift I gave him. A pet cat.

879
01:06:58,569 --> 01:07:00,127
It means worlds to me.

880
01:07:00,369 --> 01:07:02,041
I'd like to have it back.

881
01:07:02,289 --> 01:07:05,599
I'll need picture I.D.,
proof of ownership of the cat...

882
01:07:05,849 --> 01:07:09,205
...notarized proof of kinship
with the deceased.

883
01:07:10,129 --> 01:07:11,482
Don't do that.

884
01:07:13,169 --> 01:07:14,204
Do what?

885
01:07:15,329 --> 01:07:16,762
Don't do it.

886
01:07:19,249 --> 01:07:20,568
Oh, man.

887
01:07:35,609 --> 01:07:37,759
Look, Kay, let me handle this one.

888
01:07:38,009 --> 01:07:40,603
All we gotta do is get a cat.
It's not that hard.

889
01:07:40,849 --> 01:07:44,967
But if you go in there, you'll start
flashing your brain ray in her face.

890
01:07:45,169 --> 01:07:46,761
She'll wind up with leukemia.

891
01:07:47,009 --> 01:07:50,684
The doctor don't need you flashing away
her med-school classes. Five minutes.

892
01:07:50,929 --> 01:07:52,203
Two minutes.

893
01:07:54,609 --> 01:07:55,598
Where's the animal?

894
01:07:55,849 --> 01:07:57,248
I said I don't know.

895
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:59,644
Well, let's see if we can find it.

896
01:08:04,849 --> 01:08:05,918
Hello!

897
01:08:14,809 --> 01:08:15,878
Hello!

898
01:08:20,129 --> 01:08:21,608
- How you doing?
- Hello.

899
01:08:21,849 --> 01:08:24,647
I'm Sergeant Friday
from the 26th Precinct.

900
01:08:24,889 --> 01:08:27,357
A cat came in with a corpse
the other day.

901
01:08:27,609 --> 01:08:29,600
- "Orion" on the nametag?
- Right.

902
01:08:30,409 --> 01:08:33,242
Well, this cat is a witness...

903
01:08:33,489 --> 01:08:35,844
...in a murder case.
I'll need to take him.

904
01:08:36,089 --> 01:08:37,602
I don't know where the cat is.

905
01:08:37,849 --> 01:08:39,077
You don't?

906
01:08:39,609 --> 01:08:42,203
No, but maybe you could take me
with you instead.

907
01:08:44,129 --> 01:08:47,007
Damn, you do start fast,
don't you?

908
01:08:47,209 --> 01:08:48,927
I'd really like to go with you...

909
01:08:49,249 --> 01:08:50,204
...now.

910
01:08:51,129 --> 01:08:53,404
And exactly why is that?

911
01:09:00,409 --> 01:09:02,320
I need to show you something.

912
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:03,799
Slow down.

913
01:09:04,049 --> 01:09:07,166
- Girl, don't hit the gas like that!
- You don't understand.

914
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:09,559
You really need to see this.

915
01:09:09,809 --> 01:09:14,200
I will. One thing. I gotta drive.
It's not some macho trip.

916
01:09:14,409 --> 01:09:16,718
That's just the way I get down.

917
01:09:27,409 --> 01:09:29,923
Look, stud, you're
really not getting this.

918
01:09:30,129 --> 01:09:33,121
There's something I need you
to help me with.

919
01:09:43,609 --> 01:09:44,644
Freeze it!

920
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:45,878
You are thick!

921
01:09:46,129 --> 01:09:47,198
How could I know?

922
01:09:47,409 --> 01:09:48,603
Did I have to sing it?

923
01:09:48,849 --> 01:09:50,328
You were like a drunk prom date.

924
01:09:50,569 --> 01:09:54,278
Typical. Anytime a woman shows
even a hint of sexual independence...

925
01:09:54,489 --> 01:09:55,285
Shut up!

926
01:09:55,489 --> 01:09:56,285
Let her go!

927
01:09:56,489 --> 01:09:58,207
Listen, monkey-boy...

928
01:09:58,449 --> 01:10:01,521
...l'm on the top rung
of the evolutionary ladder.

929
01:10:01,769 --> 01:10:02,804
So can it.

930
01:10:03,049 --> 01:10:05,438
Show me your face,
and I'll cure your ills.

931
01:10:05,729 --> 01:10:08,960
Ever pull wings off a fly?
Care to see the fly get even?

932
01:10:09,169 --> 01:10:10,522
What about your ship?

933
01:10:10,769 --> 01:10:13,567
If that's what you call
that trash we got locked up.

934
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:16,084
- Put your weapons down!
- Won't happen.

935
01:10:16,329 --> 01:10:17,125
It's okay.

936
01:10:17,409 --> 01:10:18,888
How is it okay?

937
01:10:19,129 --> 01:10:21,120
I'm saying it's gonna be okay.

938
01:10:21,369 --> 01:10:23,200
Don't bet on it, meat sack.

939
01:10:32,569 --> 01:10:34,048
Let me go!

940
01:10:44,569 --> 01:10:45,763
Go on!

941
01:10:49,609 --> 01:10:50,837
Take me here.

942
01:10:51,089 --> 01:10:51,885
No way.

943
01:10:53,289 --> 01:10:54,085
Take me!

944
01:11:11,409 --> 01:11:12,205
He's in a cab!

945
01:11:33,769 --> 01:11:36,044
Don't move! Don't move!
Don't move!

946
01:11:36,569 --> 01:11:37,968
Hey, man, what?

947
01:11:48,769 --> 01:11:51,488
He's not leaving the planet in a cab.
Let's go.

948
01:11:56,249 --> 01:11:58,809
Put up a bionet
all the way around Manhattan.

949
01:11:59,049 --> 01:12:01,244
If it's not human, it doesn't leave.

950
01:12:02,569 --> 01:12:04,082
What do we hear from upstairs?

951
01:12:04,329 --> 01:12:05,478
"Deliver the Galaxy."

952
01:12:05,729 --> 01:12:08,607
The bug's got the Galaxy,
but we got his ship.

953
01:12:11,649 --> 01:12:13,879
Warning:
Plutonic fusion detection.

954
01:12:14,929 --> 01:12:17,204
Warning:
Plutonic fusion detection.

955
01:12:21,689 --> 01:12:24,123
- Why are they shooting at us?
- Battle rules.

956
01:12:24,369 --> 01:12:28,442
We get an ultimatum, a warning shot,
then a galactic week to respond.

957
01:12:29,009 --> 01:12:31,443
A galactic week?
How the hell long is that?

958
01:12:31,689 --> 01:12:32,724
One hour.

959
01:12:33,089 --> 01:12:34,204
One hour?

960
01:12:34,729 --> 01:12:35,764
Then what?

961
01:12:40,889 --> 01:12:42,038
That's bullshit!

962
01:12:42,249 --> 01:12:46,037
To keep the bugs from getting it,
Arquillians will destroy that galaxy.

963
01:12:46,289 --> 01:12:48,678
And whatever planet it's on.

964
01:12:49,769 --> 01:12:51,168
You're talking about us.

965
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:52,762
Sucks, huh?

966
01:12:55,249 --> 01:12:57,888
I'll get the location
of every interstellar vehicle.

967
01:12:58,129 --> 01:13:00,199
I already did.
Frank took the last ship.

968
01:13:00,449 --> 01:13:02,519
- Sneden's Landing and Throg's Neck.
- Gone.

969
01:13:02,769 --> 01:13:04,487
- What about Atlantic City?
- Gone.

970
01:13:04,729 --> 01:13:06,082
- Bayonne?
- Gone.

971
01:13:06,329 --> 01:13:08,763
- There's Three Mile Island.
- Gone.

972
01:13:09,009 --> 01:13:11,000
- Staten Island?
- Gone, thank God.

973
01:13:11,409 --> 01:13:15,118
We're running out of time. If that
bug gets off Earth, we're bug food.

974
01:13:15,369 --> 01:13:16,404
Hey, old guys!

975
01:13:21,289 --> 01:13:23,086
Do those still work?

976
01:13:37,689 --> 01:13:39,645
- You're coming with me.
- What?

977
01:13:40,169 --> 01:13:41,969
It's a long trip.
I'll need a snack.

978
01:13:41,969 --> 01:13:42,924
It's a long trip.
I'll need a snack.

979
01:13:48,689 --> 01:13:49,599
The tunnel?

980
01:13:49,849 --> 01:13:52,602
- You know a better way to Queens?
- It'll be packed!

981
01:14:05,489 --> 01:14:06,717
Remember the red button?

982
01:14:07,329 --> 01:14:08,921
Push the red button.

983
01:14:09,689 --> 01:14:10,963
Put on a seat belt.

984
01:14:23,009 --> 01:14:25,523
You're much too tense.
You're young. Relax.

985
01:14:25,769 --> 01:14:27,441
Take some joy in your work.

986
01:14:27,689 --> 01:14:28,804
Do you like music?

987
01:14:32,809 --> 01:14:33,798
That's better.

988
01:14:34,009 --> 01:14:37,319
- In Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind

989
01:14:37,769 --> 01:14:40,329
I straddled that Greyhound
And rode him into Raleigh

990
01:14:40,529 --> 01:14:42,247
And on across Caroline

991
01:14:42,649 --> 01:14:45,482
Somebody help me
Get out of Louisiana

992
01:14:47,369 --> 01:14:49,644
There are people there
Who care a little 'bout me

993
01:14:49,849 --> 01:14:53,080
- And won't let the poor boy down
- All right, now!

994
01:15:04,169 --> 01:15:05,682
You do know Elvis is dead?

995
01:15:05,929 --> 01:15:08,363
No, Elvis is not dead.
He just went home.

996
01:15:23,089 --> 01:15:24,568
You don't wanna eat me.

997
01:15:24,809 --> 01:15:27,482
I'm an important person on my planet.
Like a queen!

998
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:30,408
A goddess, even.
There are those who worship me.

999
01:15:30,649 --> 01:15:32,321
I'm not trying to impress you.

1000
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:34,525
I'm just saying it could start a war!

1001
01:15:34,769 --> 01:15:37,203
Good, war. That means
more food for my family.

1002
01:15:37,449 --> 01:15:40,680
All 78 million of them.
That's a lot of mouths to feed.

1003
01:15:40,889 --> 01:15:43,403
You're a wonderful dad,
but I'm staying here!

1004
01:16:04,169 --> 01:16:06,205
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

1005
01:16:07,449 --> 01:16:09,201
Roaches check in.

1006
01:16:11,169 --> 01:16:12,363
They don't check out.

1007
01:16:16,969 --> 01:16:20,848
Warning: E ight minutes
to the destruction of Earth.

1008
01:16:22,569 --> 01:16:23,797
E ight minutes...

1009
01:16:24,049 --> 01:16:25,243
...to destruction.

1010
01:17:08,609 --> 01:17:11,328
We'll use pulsar level five
with an implosion factor.

1011
01:17:11,569 --> 01:17:12,365
What?!

1012
01:17:12,569 --> 01:17:15,641
Just shoot the damn thing
on the count of three. One...

1013
01:17:15,889 --> 01:17:17,038
...two, three!

1014
01:18:15,289 --> 01:18:16,802
You idiots!

1015
01:18:18,009 --> 01:18:19,727
You don't get it!

1016
01:18:19,969 --> 01:18:20,799
I've won.

1017
01:18:21,609 --> 01:18:21,809
It's over.

1018
01:18:21,809 --> 01:18:23,322
It's over.

1019
01:18:23,769 --> 01:18:25,600
You're milk-suckers!

1020
01:18:26,209 --> 01:18:27,801
You don't matter.

1021
01:18:28,089 --> 01:18:30,444
In a few seconds,
you won't even be matter.

1022
01:18:30,689 --> 01:18:33,283
You're under arrest
for violating the Tycho Treaty.

1023
01:18:33,529 --> 01:18:36,168
So hand over whatever galaxy
you might be carrying...

1024
01:18:36,409 --> 01:18:39,003
...and put your hands on your head.

1025
01:18:43,809 --> 01:18:45,561
I'll put my hands...

1026
01:18:47,969 --> 01:18:49,163
...on my head.

1027
01:18:53,409 --> 01:18:54,364
Like this?

1028
01:19:22,489 --> 01:19:24,480
That did not go the way I planned.

1029
01:19:24,729 --> 01:19:26,321
Don't let him on the second ship.

1030
01:19:26,569 --> 01:19:29,367
- What are you talking about?
- Keep him on this planet.

1031
01:19:29,609 --> 01:19:31,486
Where are you going?

1032
01:19:32,089 --> 01:19:33,886
I'm gonna get my gun back.

1033
01:19:36,569 --> 01:19:37,365
Hey, bug!

1034
01:19:37,609 --> 01:19:40,407
You know how many of your kind
I've swatted with a paper?

1035
01:19:40,649 --> 01:19:43,038
You're just a smear
on the sports page...

1036
01:19:43,289 --> 01:19:46,087
...you slimy, gut-sucking,
intestinal parasite!

1037
01:19:46,569 --> 01:19:47,922
Eat me!

1038
01:19:48,129 --> 01:19:49,403
Eat me!

1039
01:20:06,969 --> 01:20:07,845
What's up?

1040
01:20:08,409 --> 01:20:11,481
You just gonna eat and run?
What about dessert?

1041
01:20:17,209 --> 01:20:18,562
That's it?

1042
01:20:18,969 --> 01:20:22,279
Where you going?
This party's just getting started.

1043
01:20:23,009 --> 01:20:24,283
Where you going?

1044
01:20:25,249 --> 01:20:26,887
Where you going?

1045
01:20:28,009 --> 01:20:29,044
Let me tell you.

1046
01:20:29,289 --> 01:20:32,599
There's only one way off this planet,
and that's through me.

1047
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:15,768
Where you going?

1048
01:21:16,609 --> 01:21:18,042
Why you running, huh?

1049
01:21:18,489 --> 01:21:20,127
I'm still standing.

1050
01:21:20,769 --> 01:21:22,680
Come on, bring it. Bring it!

1051
01:21:41,729 --> 01:21:44,084
I'm sorry.
Was that your auntie?

1052
01:21:46,209 --> 01:21:47,961
That means that's your uncle.

1053
01:21:50,849 --> 01:21:52,043
You all look alike.

1054
01:22:00,089 --> 01:22:01,807
Well, well.

1055
01:22:02,049 --> 01:22:05,405
Big, bad bug got
a bit of a soft spot, huh?

1056
01:22:08,929 --> 01:22:10,920
I can't understand why you gotta...

1057
01:22:11,169 --> 01:22:13,524
...come down here
bringing all this ruckus...

1058
01:22:13,769 --> 01:22:16,408
...snatching up galaxies
and everything.

1059
01:22:16,609 --> 01:22:20,568
My attitude is, don't start nothing,
won't be nothing.

1060
01:22:26,569 --> 01:22:30,084
Ease up out of my face before
something bad happens to you.

1061
01:22:32,089 --> 01:22:33,124
Too late.

1062
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:03,918
Tell the Arquillians
we have the Galaxy.

1063
01:23:04,169 --> 01:23:05,887
You got it, friend.

1064
01:23:07,489 --> 01:23:09,525
Going to get your gun back, huh?

1065
01:23:09,769 --> 01:23:11,168
I like this gun.

1066
01:23:11,889 --> 01:23:15,928
While you was in there playing around,
I was doing all the work.

1067
01:23:16,169 --> 01:23:19,002
I had to bean him in the head
with this big rock.

1068
01:23:19,249 --> 01:23:21,080
I was gonna hit him with a 2-by-4.

1069
01:23:21,329 --> 01:23:22,842
He kicked me. It hurt.

1070
01:23:23,089 --> 01:23:25,728
But then I got to the fire.
I was like that with it.

1071
01:23:25,969 --> 01:23:28,278
Not bad for your second
day of work, is it?

1072
01:23:29,089 --> 01:23:32,286
This definitely rates a 9.0
on my weird-shit-o-metre.

1073
01:23:32,689 --> 01:23:36,284
Should've been here for
the Zeronion migration in 1968.

1074
01:23:38,809 --> 01:23:41,323
I guess you weren't even alive in '68.

1075
01:23:46,769 --> 01:23:49,283
Interesting job you guys have.

1076
01:24:04,769 --> 01:24:06,521
I know we got these rules...

1077
01:24:06,769 --> 01:24:08,919
...but she did help us bust that bug.

1078
01:24:09,169 --> 01:24:11,729
Maybe we didn't have to
flashy-thing her.

1079
01:24:13,329 --> 01:24:16,401
Come on. Who will she tell?
She hang out with dead people.

1080
01:24:16,649 --> 01:24:18,207
It's not for her.

1081
01:24:18,449 --> 01:24:19,677
It's for me.

1082
01:24:21,329 --> 01:24:22,603
What?

1083
01:24:24,729 --> 01:24:25,878
Aren't they beautiful?

1084
01:24:27,609 --> 01:24:28,405
Stars.

1085
01:24:29,009 --> 01:24:31,921
I never look at them anymore,
but they actually are...

1086
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:35,888
...beautiful.

1087
01:24:40,369 --> 01:24:42,644
Kay, you're frightening your partner.

1088
01:24:42,889 --> 01:24:45,881
I've been training a replacement,
not a partner.

1089
01:24:46,889 --> 01:24:48,447
Wait a minute, Kay.

1090
01:24:48,929 --> 01:24:51,079
I cannot do this job by myself.

1091
01:24:51,329 --> 01:24:53,889
Guys, my apartment isn't
anywhere near here.

1092
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:55,966
It's not even on the same island.

1093
01:24:57,489 --> 01:24:58,444
Days...

1094
01:24:58,649 --> 01:24:59,798
...months...

1095
01:25:00,049 --> 01:25:01,164
...years.

1096
01:25:01,489 --> 01:25:03,081
Always face it forward.

1097
01:25:12,369 --> 01:25:14,929
I was in an interstellar
cockroach's gullet.

1098
01:25:15,169 --> 01:25:17,478
That's one of 100 memories
I don't want.

1099
01:25:33,889 --> 01:25:35,163
See you around.

1100
01:25:41,169 --> 01:25:42,284
No...

1101
01:25:43,049 --> 01:25:44,277
...you won't.

1102
01:26:18,729 --> 01:26:20,845
The high consulate
from Solaxium 9...

1103
01:26:21,049 --> 01:26:22,880
...wants seats for the Bulls game.

1104
01:26:23,129 --> 01:26:25,597
Call Dennis Rodman.
He's from that planet.

1105
01:26:27,769 --> 01:26:29,327
Rodman? You're kidding.

1106
01:26:29,609 --> 01:26:30,598
Nope.

1107
01:26:31,169 --> 01:26:33,125
Not much of a disguise.

1108
