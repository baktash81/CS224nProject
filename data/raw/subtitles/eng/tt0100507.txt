<i>We're in Moscow in the Soviet Union.</i>

4
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,956
<i>This promises to be the most watched</i>

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,956
I must break you.

6
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,079
- Throw your right!
<i>- He will not let him out of there.</i>

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,156
Rocky!

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,109
<i>Rocky Balboa is in serious trouble.</i>

<i>Drago continuing</i>

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,315

- No pain!

12
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,436
<i>Rocky's been hit with bombs.</i>

13
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,754
<i>Rocky's hurt!</i>

<i>A right hand from Drago sends</i>
<i>Rocky Balboa 15 feet across the ring!</i>

15
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,190
Come on! Get up!

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,798
<i>It's been a one-sided fight so far.</i>

17
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,754
<i>And Drago throws a hard right hand</i>
<i>that stuns Rocky Balboa!</i>

18
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,799
<i>They might have to stop this one</i>
<i>before somebody gets killed.</i>

19
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,914
<i>Rocky taking punishment.</i>
<i>He's completely exhausted.</i>

20
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,033
<i>And Balboa goes down again</i>

21
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,154

<i>Amazing willpower!</i>

00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,354

24
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,836
- All right, what's happenin' out there?
- I see three of 'em.

25
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,555
- Hit the one in the middle.
- Right! Hit the one in the middle.

26
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,189
<i>- The Russian's cut.</i>
- Hit him!

Oh, man, I never saw nothing like it!
Came through like the champ you are.

36
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,630
Did yourself and everybody proud!

37
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,910
Especially Apollo!

38
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,350
- Yo, Tony!
- Yeah, what is it? What do you need?

39
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,436
Get Adrian.

40
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,199
- Rocky?
- How's everybody doin'... out there?

41
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,834
Oh! Everything's OK.

42
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,196
What's wrong?

43
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,830
- What's wrong?
- Remember when Mick said...

44
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,599
...when he was fighting sometimes...

45
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,590
...he'd fight so hard that he was thinking
that he broke somethin' inside?

46
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,393
He was gonna... die?

47
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,356
And that's what he said,
that's when the angels was pullin' on him.

48
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,756
Rocky, you're scaring me.
I don't... What's wrong?

49
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,440
- I can't...
- Can't what?

50
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,074
I can't stop my hands from shaking.

51
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,312
- I ain't never felt this thing.
- You better see a doctor.

52
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,159
No. I just wanna go home.

53
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,236
No. You can see a doctor.

54
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,749
I'm just tired.

55
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,314
I just wanna go home, Mick.

56
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,793
- I'm just tired. I just...
- OK.

57
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,354
- I just wanna go home, OK?
- OK.

58
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,158

- I made the honour roll.
- Yo!

69
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,352
Hi. Airport Security. Welcome home.
There's a press reception inside.

70
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,553
Rocky, how did you feel
about the Russian people?

71
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,148
You know, very good.
They was great people.

72
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,637
I didn't understand them all the time,
but I understood what they was meaning.

73
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,910
Mrs Balboa, did you learn any Russian?

74
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,794
- Did I learn Russian?
- Yeah, she got fluent in vodka.

75
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,918
Rocky, there are rumours
of physical complications.

76
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,157
- Complications?
- No, those were rumours.

77
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,158
He's in perfect physical condition.

78
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,760
Rocky, the American Medical Association
has recommended that boxing be banned.

79
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,075
- Yeah.
- Do you agree with the doctors?

80
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,988
Yeah, absolutely.
I think that doctors should never fight.

81
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,634
That was a beautiful answer, champ!

82
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,356
Doctors should stay out of the ring.
Doctors should never fight.

83
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,199
Rocky Balboa,
the funniest champion ever!

84
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,880
America's own, Rocky Balboa!
How are ya?

85
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,833
George Washington Duke,
promoter <i>extraordinaire...</i>

86
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,910
...welcomes Rocky Balboa, champion
of all the Americas and all of the Russias.

87
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,713
Now I would like to digress
from the questions a bit...

88
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,035
...and pose a proposition to the media.

89
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,473
Everyone in this city and in the
world of sports knows my reputation...

90
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,878
...for promoting some of the finest
extravaganzas in this country.

91
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,120
Well now, with the press present,
I'd like to ask you, Rocky Balboa...

92
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,631
...to be the flamboyant, rambunctious
sportsman we know you can be.

93
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,036
Give this man, Union Cane,
a chance to challenge you...

94
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,276
...for the heavyweight championship.

95
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,949
Balboa, I want the opportunity
to take what you got.

96
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,959
Isn't this bad timing, Duke?
The man just got off the plane.

97
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,958
Timing is the essence of life,
gentlemen and ladies.

98
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,595
Now what I have on this paper
is the largest guarantee...

99
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,598
...ever offered to
a champion on this planet!

100
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,669
I'm talking about a fantastic international
extravaganza to be held in Japan...

101
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,712
...called Lettin' It Go In Tokyo!

102
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,315
It's incredible. Only in America do people
like us rise from oppression and poverty...

103
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,398
...to join hands in this international event!

104
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,671
- Excuse me!
- Only in America!

105
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,598
Excuse me. My husband is retired.

106
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,154
He has nothing more to prove.

107
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,271
Wait a minute! Hey, Rocky...

108
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,030
Don't you consider this a public
responsibility to respond now?

109
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,391
- Respond to the people.
- Isn't this about professionalism?

110
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,115
- To talk about it now, not later.
- Do you mind if I heal first?

111
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,153
- You got nothin' like what I got for you.
- What the hell does this all mean?

112
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,319
- That isn't enough. We gotta know now.
- Gotta think about that. So anyway...

113
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,638
I wanna tell everybody that
the flight over was... really nice.

114
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,876
- Come on, guys. We need more.
- Adrian, if you weren't with me...

115
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,276
...I never woulda done as good.
You're always there.

116
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,235
And my kid, having you is
like being born all over again.

117
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,635
Come on. Are you gonna retire or not?

118
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,151
- Anyway, excuse me. I'd like to go home.
- Give us something to write!

119
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,556
- Thanks very much. I appreciate it.
- No!

120
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,390
Don't worry. We'll get him. We'll get him.

121
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,949
No, really. It's great.

122
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,640
Aaah! Yo!

123
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:34,312
Look at this place! I swear I ain't never
leavin' this place again, you know that?

124
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,877
Hey, would you like to dance? How about
a homecoming dance for your old man?

125
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,276
- No, don't be silly. It's cold.
- I'll warm you up, young lady.

126
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,517
Have a dance. Hurry up.
The music's almost over.

127
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,275
- Do you like the song?
- You should rest.

128
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,436
- Yeah, I know.
- I'm tired. Come on.

129
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,155
Maybe I'll take you upstairs and
violate you like a parkin' meter.

130
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,874
- Cost you a quarter.
- Yo, Adrian!

131
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,753
Where'd you learn to talk dirty like that?

132
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,713
Uncle Paulie,
you notice somethin' strange about Dad?

133
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,035
He just took a few hard shots.

134
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,357
I think you tell
better jokes than me, Adrian.

135
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,595
Yo!

136
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,110
Did I hear somebody
call for their old man? Did you do this?

137
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,912
Sleep time, kid, OK?

138
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,476
Dad, did you know your bones
grow three times as fast at night?

139
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,956
No, I didn't, but I heard somethin' like that.
Is that me?

140
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,116
- Oh yeah, that's you.
- Excellent!

141
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,232
- Is that me? When we was fishin', right?
- Yeah.

142
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,590
That's beautiful! Look at the tent.

143
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,871
You know,
the fish was a lot bigger, if I recall.

144
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,109
Actually, that was a lot smaller.

145
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,559
Anyway, come on. Hit the bed.
It's time for you to get healthy.

146
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,672
This is great.
I don't know where you learned this.

147
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,395
It is something how this thing
comes out of your fingers and...

148
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,476
Oh my God.

149
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,076
Oh my God!

150
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,996
Who's this?

151
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,952
That's Madame Dupont,
my French teacher.

152
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,516
Really?!

153
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,668
Hmm, yeah. She looks French, sure.

154
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,749
I wouldn't show this to your mother, cos
she... don't understand French too good.

155
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,599
God. Better cover that one up.

156
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,109
Well, champ, it's bedtime.

157
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,993
Hey, you know what?
I know some French talk.

158
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,156
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

159
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,555
- Madame.
- Madame who?

160
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,558
- My damn foot's caught in the door!
- That's an old joke!

161
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,194
What do you want from me? I'm trying.

162
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,629
I don't know all the good things,
you know?

163
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,832
- Whoa! What's this?
- What?

164
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,872
Look what I found in your ear.
Russian money. Money ears!

165
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,232
All right. Anyway, listen.
You gotta get some sleep.

166
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,751
Dad? Today, when you said
having me was like being born again...

167
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,314
- Yeah?
- What did you mean?

168
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,273
Well, you know, you come up like I did...

169
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:07,350
...and you got, like, three square meals
of zero a day - know what I mean? - 

170
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,675
...you got the A-side of life and the B-side.

171
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,349
I'm on the B-side, but you...
you got all the breaks.

172
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,632
So when I see you having
all these things that I didn't have...

173
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,638
...l, like, live through your eyes.

174
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,151
I enjoy it a little bit.
It's like having it all over again.

175
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,271
That's nice.

176
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,393
Hey, look in my face.
Do I look like a raccoon?

177
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,236
- A little bit.
- Like Rocky Raccoon?

178
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,952
- Yeah, a little bit.
- Nah!

179
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,911
- Yeah, you do a little.
- Really?

180
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,591
Hey, if you think I look bad,
you oughta see the other guy's knuckles.

181
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,154
Anyway, yo! Good... night.

182
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,236
- OK, kid?
- Night.

183
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,438
- Dad?
- Yo?

184
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,035
- Glad you're home.
- Thanks. I appreciate it.

185
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,593
We'll play tomorrow, OK? Maybe
you can show me your English teacher.

186
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,154
- She's pretty hot too.
- Nah!

187
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,318
Good night, kid.

188
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,670
<i>(Adrian)</i> You deserve the worst
for what you did.

189
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,678
- That was Rocky's money.
- You wanna be hysterical?

190
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,553
- You cost us everything.
- It was a mistake.

191
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,194
You think I thought
this was gonna happen?

192
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,916
Don't you walk away from me.
You just gave up our life!

193
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,235
And you think it's some stupid thing?

194
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,239
Paulie, do you know what you did?
Do you know the seriousness of it?

195
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,751
I understand it!
I understand the whole freakin' thing!

196
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,111
I understand it!
Your accountant's a crook, not me!

197
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,993
I did what I thought was right.
Don't blame me.

198
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,475
I want to murder the bum
worse than anybody!

199
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,556
Adrian, what's wrong?

200
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,240
Look what you done now.
She's dumpin' it all on me.

201
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,238
- Come on, don't turn this around on me.
- What did you do?

202
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,716
He gave power of attorney
to our accountant.

203
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,438
I just didn't gave anything to nobody.

204
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,916
He sent a letter. He says
"We'll be in Russia a couple of months...

205
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,429
...and I need Rocky
to sign a tax extension."

206
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,109
That extension was
a power of attorney, Paulie!

207
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,118
He's the thief! I need alcohol.

208
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,835
Rocky, on my eyes,
I never stole a freakin' dime!

209
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,474
Adrian, what's happenin' here?

210
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,556
- It's gone.
- What's gone?

211
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,673
The money. The money.
Everything. It's all gone.

212
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,078
The piece of paper Paulie had you sign
wasn't a request for a tax extension.

213
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,079
It was a blanket power of attorney
in favour of the accountant...

214
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,953
...who was involved in
some high-priced real estate.

215
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,073
He thought he could have your money
back before you knew it was gone.

216
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,919
Unfortunately for you
and everybody in this room...

217
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,158
...his deals fell through because the
market dried up. And you lost millions.

218
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,353
- Ain't there nothin' I can do?
- I've filed eight criminal acts against him.

219
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,153
But you've got debt payment
on this property...

220
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,478
...he didn't pay your tax returns and your
mortgage hasn't been paid in months!

221
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,876
We didn't have a mortgage.
Our house was fully paid for.

222
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,949
- Don't take it from me. Ask him.
- There's nearly $400,000 outstanding.

223
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,709
The only thing that's not encumbered
is a gym, willed to your son...

224
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,752
...by a Mickey Goldmill in 1982.

225
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,917
You can sell things.
Remember those commercials you did?

226
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,476
I ain't no commercial kinda guy.
I'm a fighter. That's what I do.

227
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,752
Nah, we couldn't get sponsors.
With the investigation of the accountant...

228
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,429
...out pops a criminal record
of Rocky's for assault.

229
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,949
But that was a long time ago.
He didn't know...

230
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,153
Why not a couple more fights? With
your popularity, you'd be out in no time.

231
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,794
- He's retiring.
- Rocko, fightin's the ticket.

232
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,799
I said he's retired.
Paulie, we're here because of you!

233
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,879
I'm not taking the heat for all this.
I thought I was doing smart business.

234
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,279
- You thought you did smart business?!
- Hey! The accountant was your choice!

235
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:52,155
You shoulda known he was a thief, but in
your fairy-tale world the air don't move.

236
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,953
- You're like a season that don't change!
- Hey, enough.

237
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,992
- I'm not no tomato can you kick around!
- Paulie! No!

238
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,193
You call Duke. Tell him I'll fight Cane.
I don't care. Anywhere, any time.

239
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,630
- No! Rocky, no!
- If that's what you want, I'll get on it.

240
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,036
- Rocky, please!
- A couple of fights, we're outta trouble.

241
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,833
- Yeah, but you said...
- No, I didn't say anything.

242
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,952
- Did we come this far to lose it?
- You have to see a doctor.

243
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:20,029
- I don't need a doctor. I need a promoter.
- If the doctor says OK, I'll support you.

244
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,516
I gotta fight, OK?
I got problems. I gotta fight.

245
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,596
Will you do it for me?

246
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,033
All right. For you.

247
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,593
Because of continuous
violent blows to the head...

248
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,157
...you have a condition particular to boxers
called <i>cavum septum pellucidum...</i>

249
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,431
...which is a hole in the membrane
separating the ventricles.

250
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,235
The brain surface neurons in this area
have also been traumatised.

251
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,753
Simply stated, Mr Balboa, it means you've
suffered some damage to the brain.

252
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,112
<i>- (Adrian)</i> How long until he recovers?
- The effects are irreversible.

253
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,878
Oh, I...

254
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,195
Rocky, you... you have to retire.

255
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,519
I don't wanna retire. This ain't the time
to retire. Not in here, not in no office.

256
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:09,275
I just fought the best fight of my life.
I just did that, you know?

257
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,155
- And all I need is... a couple more.
- No. You suffered severe brain trauma.

258
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,840
He could be wrong.
Anybody could be wrong.

259
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,349
He ain't God.
Adrian, only God ain't wrong.

260
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,155
- Rocky, this is what's good for you.
- I only need a couple of easy ones.

261
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,910
Not the way it is. You can't get licensed
in any State. He can't, can he, Doctor?

262
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,749
- That is correct.
- Rocky, do you love me?

263
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,597
- Yeah, I love you. Why do you ask that?
- Because if you love somebody...

264
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,679
...you live with them, you live for them.
You don't gamble with a life.

265
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,475
Rocky, I don't care about the money.
It's you.

266
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,556
That's all that matters.

267
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,918
Please. We'll be OK. We'll be fine.

268
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,710

269

Uh...

270
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:08,795
- No one has to know, Doctor, right?
- It'll be strictly confidential.

271
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,276

Hey, it still fits.

Why are you wearin' those clothes?

288
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,269
I was just going through some stuff and I
found 'em. They feel kinda comfortable.

289
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,359
I was looking all over for you downstairs.
It's kind of depressing.

290
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,074
Yeah. I know what you mean.

291
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,158
Oh! What's this doin' in your ear?

I... Yeah.

294
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,918
- I remember when you took 'em off.
- That's right. First time I ever kissed you.

295
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:21,234
Adrian, I wanna go out for a bit.
You know, just take a little walk.

296
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,750
I just wanna feel better.
But hey, could you talk to the kid?

297
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,351
- Cos he's... he's really taking this hard.
- Sure.

298
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,154
- Where are you going?
- I thought I'd go to Andy's.

<i>- (man)</i> He used to be a champion.
<i>- (woman)</i> How did he blow it all?

00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,715
How you doin', Mick?

301
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,036
Slip the jab.

302
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,993
- Slip the jab.
<i>- (Mick) Slip the jab.</i>

That's right. That's it.

305
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,313
- Hey, I didn't hear no bell!
- OK.

306
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,432
All right! That's right. Slip the jab.

307
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:50,269
That's it. Mentalise!
See that bum in front of you.

308
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,279
You see yourself doin' right,
and you do right.

309

Come here, Rock.
My God, you're ready, ain't ya?

312
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,079
Apollo won't know what hit him.
You'll roll over him like a bulldozer.

313
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,156
An Italian bulldozer.

314
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,159
You know, kid, I know how you feel
about this fight that's comin' up.

315
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,555
Because I was young once too.

316
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,154
I tell you somethin'.

317
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,635
Why, if you wasn't here...

318
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,957
...hey, I probably wouldn't be alive today.

319
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,631
The fact that you're here and doin'
as well as you're doin' gives me...

320
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,992
What do you call it?
A motivisation to stay alive.

321
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,432
<i>Cos I think that people die sometimes</i>
<i>when they don't wanna live no more.</i>

322
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,596
Nature's smarter than people think.

323
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,998
And nature is smarter than people think.
Little by little we lose our friends...

324
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,830
...we lose everything and we keep
losin' and losin', till we say...

325
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,351
..."What the hell am I livin' around
here for? I got no reason to go on."

326
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,755
But with you, kid...

327
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,110
Boy, I got a reason to go on.

328
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,678
<i>And I'm gonna stay alive.</i>
<i>And I will watch you make good.</i>

329
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:08,078
- And I'll never leave you.
- I'll never leave you until that happens.

330
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,796
Cos when I leave you,
you'll not only know how to fight...

331
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,959
...you'll be able to take care of yourself
outside the ring too. Is that OK?

332
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,674
<i>- It's OK.</i>
<i>- OK.</i>

333
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,711
- I got a gift for you.
- Ah, Mickey.

334
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,957
- Wait a minute now.
- Really, I don't need nothin'.

335
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:32,474
Look at that. See that? This here's the
favourite thing that I have on this earth.

336
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,717
And Rocky Marciano give me that.

337
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,559
You know what it was? His cuff link.

338
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,592
And now I'm givin' it to you.

339
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,632
<i>And it's gonna be like, uh...</i>

340
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,275
Like an angel on your shoulder, see?

341
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,599
And if you ever get hurt and
you feel that you're goin' down...

342
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,678
...this little angel
is gonna whisper in your ear.

343
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,156
He's gonna say
"Get up, you son of a bitch!"

344
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,035
"Cos Mickey loves you."

345
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,515
<i>OK?</i>

346
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,438
Thanks, Mick. I love you too.

347
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,994
Jesus. Go after him, kid.

348
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,436
- Go after him.
- Thanks.

349
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,034
You was the angel.

350
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,118
- There it is.
- What happened to his other cuff link?

351
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,879
I don't know. He only give me one.

352
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,150
He gave it to some bum.

All right, let's go, Paulie.

370
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,869
I really can't believe it.
This kid's taking this too good.

371
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,198
Hey, Rock, it's good I kept the place,
right? It saves money.

372
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,673
Get back.

373
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,032
Right? A little aluminum on the front too.
It's a winner!

00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,796

<i>- George Washington Duke here.</i>
- Yes?

381
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:12,356
Mrs Balboa, can you hear it?
Listen close. You must be able to hear it.

382
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,948
- Hear what?
<i>- The sound of the parade going by...</i>

383
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,036
<i>... of opportunity knocking.</i>

384
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,151

385
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,511
...l'm givin' you a chance
to pull yourselves together?

386
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,998
Let me handle your husband's career
and you can live like human beings again.

387
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:33,194
Listen, Mr Duke, we're living like human
beings. You oughta try it some time.

388
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,595
And leave my husband alone.

389
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,676
Women!

390
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,875
When'd you start that?

391
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,629
I don't know. It's like a bad
habit that comes back. But, hey!

392
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,718
We ain't talkin' about me.
We're talkin' about you.

393
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,796
Hey, Rocky, how you doin', man?

394
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,388
- Good to see you back.
- Thanks. Great to <i>be</i> back.

395
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:04,149
You're smart in school,
but you gotta be smart on the street too.

396
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,033
- How do you mean?
- You gotta know who the players are...

397
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:11,392
...and who you're talkin' to.
- Watch out for scams. Everyone scams.

398
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,750
- What's a scam?
- Ask your father.

399
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,879
- A scam is like a hustle.
- He don't get it.

400
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,673
- Well, a hustle's related to...
- <i>(woman)</i> Rocky!

401
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,155
- Remember me? I'm Bubba's mother.
- Oh, yeah.

402
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,239
- You used his head for a punchin' bag.
- Yeah, he had a nice head.

403
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,796
- Anyway, a hustle's related to a con.
- He don't get it.

404
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,071
A deception?
You're saying beware of deceptions.

405
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,079
Yeah, that's good. Absolutely.
You're very smart, you know?

406
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,428
Hey!

407
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,120
Ain't this where
the Atomic Hoagy shop used to be?

408
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,117
I'm new here, Dad.

409
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,313
- This neighbourhood's got tooth decay.
- It's called urban blight.

410
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,750
I'll tell you somethin', this place
is blightin' everywhere.

411
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,112
A little aluminum siding and paint, this
place could be OK. What do you think?

412
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:02,598
Anyway, we're late for school.
Paulie, I wanna talk to the kid private like.

413
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,676
- Like I got no feelings.
- Oh, come on.

414
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,553
- That's how wars start.
- Relax, would you?

415
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,593
- So anyway, everybody's got an angle.
- Yo! Tough break, Rock.

416
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:16,919
Everybody's got a hustle. These kids have
got street brains. That's how they live.

417
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:21,511
These kids ain't like no personalities
that you've grown up with.

418
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,155
- So you gotta stay very sharp round here.
- I intend to.

419
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:29,831
Intend! You know, sometimes
you make me feel very stupid.

420
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,350
- Why?
- Why? Cos you're smarter than me.

421
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,913
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

422
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,874
It's like every day you learn somethin'
new and I forget somethin' new.

423
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,719
But hey, listen.
We're in this thing together.

424
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,469
If you can figure out how to fix things up,
don't be afraid to tell me.

425
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,478
We gotta stick together, cos what are we?

426
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,955
- What?
- What are we?

427
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,118
- Oh, home team.
- Home team! You've got that right.

428
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:00,917
I used to go to this school when I was
a kid. Nice bricks. It was real tough then.

429
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,237
But... I think you can handle it,
don't you think?

430
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,438
If you went here, I can go here.

431
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,915
I'm not scared really.

432
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,871
Really?

433
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,309
Well, I guess I'm a little scared.

434
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,830
- But that's normal, don't you think?
- Oh, yeah. I had 72 fights...

435
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:25,114
...and every one of 'em I was scared, so
yeah, you know, that's real, real normal.

436
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,236
- I'll see you later.
- OK, kid. Here's the front door.

437
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,271
Hey, wait! What's this?

438
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,114
Goodness gracious!
Where'd this come from?

439
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,437
It's a strange place
to stash your lunch money, don't you...

440
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,437
It's just a lunch joke, you know?

441
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:48,155
- Thanks, Dad.
- OK, listen. I'll see you later.

442
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,670
Remember, Daddy loves you.
You're number one. Home team!

443
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,155
Just be nice, right? You'll be OK.

444
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:59,989
And don't mess with nobody's girlfriend.
They don't like that around here.

445
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,030
You know,
I'm really worried about the kid.

446
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,470
He ain't used to livin' like this.
He don't know the streets.

447
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,875
At school, I know what's gonna happen.

448
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,835
Some wise guy's gonna come up to him
cos he's my kid and try to bang him out.

449
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,793
Give him a cheap shot, you know?
I mean, jeez...

450
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,515
- Mr Balboa, my name's Tommy Gunn.
- Yeah? How you doin'?

451
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,756
With that name, you better be tough!

452
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:32,351
It ain't easy. Anyway, I'm from Oklahoma.
My amateur record is 45 to 1.

453
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,155
- I turned pro at 18 and I had eight fights.
- You're a fighter?

454
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,317
And now that I'm 20,
I'd just like to show you what I got.

455
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,115
- I've saved up to pay for training.
- Mr Rocky Balboa!

456
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,552
Excuse me, I have some business here.
Good to see you again, friend.

457
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,877
<i>- (Rocky)</i> How you doin'?
- My health is fine. What more can I ask?

458
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,515
- Listen, I gotta go to work now.
- What, here? In a sweatbox?

459
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,871
- Can't be good for the image.
- Urban light. What can you do?

460
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,594
What'd you say? It's blight. Urban blight.

461
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,838
George wants you to consider wearing
gloves again. It's a helluva payday.

462
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,633
- I'm officially expired.
- You have marquee value.

463
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:13,278
You put asses into seats. A businessman
don't retire if he can still pull in the bread.

464
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,632
- Only America gives these opportunities.
- Union Cane's going for the title.

465
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,832
Here's some tickets.
We've a strong feeling about this.

466
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,919
- If he takes it, that's the time to challenge.
- People love comebacks.

467
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,430
There's nothing more commercial
than a long-shot comeback...

468
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,835
...of a down-on-his-luck underdog.

469
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,953
As Mark Twain said: "Virtue has
never been as respectable as money."

470
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,672
- Who's Twain?
- A painter.

471
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,836
You're the Great White Hope.

472
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,679
You mean Great White Dope. No, forget it.

473
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,952
Hold the bullshit. I know the problem.
You think I was born yesterday?

474
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,074
Merlin, show him the paper. This is your
medical report. We can work around it.

475
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,430
- Where'd you get this?
- It doesn't matter.

476
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,791
If you fight Cane, George can
guarantee to get you a license.

477
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,512
- Guaranteed.
- You can do this?

478
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,234
- No problem.
- This comeback's in the bag.

479
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,512
- The time's hot. The deal's hot. <i>Caliente!</i>
- We could use one more payday.

480
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:10,077
- Adrian, where'd you come from?
- Mrs Balboa just appeared! She's magic!

481
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,636
I don't think you're funny.
Are you talking him into fighting?

482
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,070
Talking business, darlin'.
Do you like feelin' hard up?

483
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,557
Do you like reachin' in your pocket
and only feelin' your leg? I didn't think so.

484
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,956
I'm offering you the opportunity
to dump this loser image.

485
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,197
- Who are you talking to?
- You ain't workin' across...

486
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,279
What the hell are you talkin' about?
This is a tremendous opportunity!

487
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,154
Opportunity for who? For you to make
money? For him to be disabled?

488
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,953
What would you do
if the choices were reversed?

489
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,071
You have to think about that.

490
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,919
Rocky, they don't care about you.

491
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:48,354
Let's get serious. You represent
the dreams of the long shots.

492
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,792
The little people identify with you.
That is the key to public success.

493
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:57,391
You a true champion, a true product of
the people. Sell it while they'll still buy.

494
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:01,274
That ain't gonna last forever.
You say you a fighter, then fight!

495
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,632
And I'll make you so much money you
can swim in it. You can swim, can't you?

496
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,957
Whaddaya say?
Put some hustle behind this muscle.

497
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,674
He's done! He's done fighting!

498
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,750
You a damn fool.

499
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,193
Maybe we oughta sign
Mrs Balboa to fight Cane, huh?

500
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,199
Looks like she's the one
with the <i>cojones</i> in the family.

501
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,194
You don't talk like that in front of my wife.

502
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,756
That ain't no park bench, boy.

503
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,519
- I'll get him.
- Rocky, I'm really sorry. I didn't wanna...

504
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,154
You guys want privacy? I'll be upstairs.

505
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,275
Rocky.

506
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,516
Rocky, I'm sorry. I... I...

507
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,871
But it just takes one bad hit
and you could be an invalid.

508
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,676
I feel like an invalid already. Why'd you
come back? You're too smart for this!

509
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,076
I got nothing to do. Gloria - I called Gloria.

510
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,239
- She said she could use part-time help.
- But why do you wanna do this?

511
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,239
Why go back to where you started?
I gotta do it, but you don't gotta do it!

512
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,716
I wanted to be there
so I could be close to you.

513
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,718
All right, yeah.
You know, it's gettin' cold out here.

514
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,991
Maybe we better get inside, OK?
I understand.

515
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,872
- Are you all right?
- What?

516
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,639
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right. I'm fine.

517
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,910
Adrian, it's gettin' cold, OK?

518
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,075
Yo, Adrian! Did we ever leave this place?

519
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,716
I don't know.

520
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,274
Hey, mind if I talk to you now?

521
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,960
My head's a little busy right now.

522
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,555
You won't get him.
Balboa don't think straight.

523
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,593
- None of these bums do. I need an angle.
- I'll fight Balboa right now.

524
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,957
- I'm better than Balboa ever was.
- Hey! Hey!

525
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,798
I own the paper on you.
You will fight who I tell you...

526
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,196
...where I tell you
and how I tell you. You got that?

527
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,152
Don't aggravate
the hand that feeds you, huh?

528
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,960
None of these bums think straight.

529
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,272
All I need is a hook.

530
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,000
Hey! Ain't you Rocky's kid?

531
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,317
- Yeah! You Rocky's kid, right?
- Yeah. How're you doing?

532
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,431
I've seen your picture in the paper.

533
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,757
- You know what? Your old man's a punk.
- What?!

534
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,793
- Get off me!
- What are you wearing my coat for?

535
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,388
- Just leave him alone!
- You wanna beatin' too?

536
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,671
- Gimme my coat! I'm not kiddin' around.
- No way!

537
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,515
- Don't get sick now!
- Hope you don't catch cold, rich boy!

538
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,870
Keep it high. Slip and slide. That's it.

539
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,356
This is the cup Rocky drinks out of
around the house. Ten bucks.

540
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,790
- How I know it's the real thing?
- Look at the lip marks.

541
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,878
- All right. Five bucks. No more.
- You got a deal.

542
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,990
- Excuse me.
- Tommy Gunn!

543
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,873
- Is there some place I can change?
- In there.

544
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,753
Time! Hey, Richard,
good friend, listen to me.

545
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,348
If you wanna survive,
you gotta slip the jab.

546
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:03,473
Keep it high and hit and not get hit,
you know? OK, take off.

547
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,319
- Rocko, remember Tommy Gunn?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

548
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,874
He says he wants to fight.
I tell him to get married.

549
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,592
Why?

550
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,315
- That's gym humour, Rocko.
- Oh? OK.

551
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,238
Let's see what you got there, kid.

552
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,112
Get married. I understand.

553
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,993
- Benson! Wanna move a little?
- Yeah, all right.

554
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:26,159
Hey, Paulie, what's the <i>cojones?</i>

555
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,793
- <i>Cojones?</i>
- Yeah.

556
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,957
<i>Cojones</i> is Latin for Spanish nuts.

557
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,833
- Yo, Rock, we're ready.
- Wonderful.

558
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,999
Hey, kid. You got the headgear?

559
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,076
Nah, I don't need one.

560
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,159
He's gonna get his <i>cojones</i> knocked out.

561
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,952
OK. Ready, guys?

562
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,311
- Benson, go easy, all right?
- Sure. OK, Rocky.

563
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,510
Time!

564
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,950
All right, just go easy now.
Slip the jab now.

565
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,196
Ooh!

566
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,278
- Hey, kid! What's his name again?
- Tommy Gunn.

567
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,233
Tommy, whoa! It ain't no law to duck.

568
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,356
Go side to side. That's it.

569
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,436
Whoa!

570
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,309
- Hey, man! Take it easy!
- Come on, lighten up. It's called sparring.

571
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,510
Hey! OK! Hey, kid!

572
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,835
Hey, lighten up! Time out!

573
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,793
Smell that, Rocko?
The odour of opportunity.

574
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,593
Hey, that's it!
What did I tell you? Hey! Time!

575
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,711
Hey, that's it! Time!

576
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,390
Hey, back off! That's enough!
What's the matter with you?

577
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,229
- Tommy, are you crazy or somethin'?
- What's the matter with you, man?

578
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,113
- I'm sorry.
- Go cool off, kid. Sorry about this.

579
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,629
He stinks of opportunity, Rocko.

580
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,957
Hey, look,
goin' easy don't mean breakin' bones.

581
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:50,039
- I'm sorry. But what do you think?
- What do I think? I don't think you listen.

582
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,119
But you - you brawl
like you was a street fighter.

583
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,869
I know somethin' about that,
but this is boxing. It ain't mugging!

584
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,869
- I'm sorry, but I know I can do it all.
- Yeah? Well, not on this date, OK?

585
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,470
- That's it?
- I gotta work with these kids here.

586
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,116
How about you tryin' to manage me?

587
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,434
- Manage?!
- Yeah.

588
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,358
Unless you think I ain't got nothin' goin'.

589
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,879
Nothin' goin'?

590
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,154
Yeah, all right, you got a lot goin'. You got
a lot of tools. But I ain't no manager.

591
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,078
The gentleman that owned this place -
that was a manager.

592
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,590
But me, I was always the managed... guy.

593
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,155
Hey, look. Good luck, all right?

594
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,869
All right, guys. Let's go.

595
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,956
Come on. Move around.

596
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,036
That's it. Nice.

597
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,476
All right, you guys, come on.
No cheap shots. Move it around.

598
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,750
How you doin'?

599
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,235
Cold? You look cold.

600
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:11,319
I guess that has something
to do with the weather.

601
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,715
Here. Take my coat.

602
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,593
No, thanks. Where's your boyfriend?

603
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,478
Him? Forget it. He ain't got no manners.

604
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,435
I'm Jewel, if you wanna know.

605
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,076
I'm Robert.

606
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,758
Hi.

607
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:36,072
Well, I been living here about
six years now. It ain't Disneyland!

608
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,839
- You been to Disneyland?
- Sure.

609
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,554
You make it sound like everybody has.

610
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,800
I know you can't tell by the way I look,
but I ain't like the other kids around here.

611
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,673
Why?
I mean, what makes you so different?

612
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,237
I don't know. I guess it's cos
I wanna get out. You know how it is.

613
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,674
Hmm. You know, for an Italian kid...

614
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,516
...you ain't got a bad butt.

615
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:12,150
- First money I get, I'm goin' to Miami.
- Why Miami?

616
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,592
- Miami needs new gigolos.
- Yeah, I read somethin' like that.

617
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,188
Ow!

618
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,676
My back is getting bad.
How come <i>you</i> don't have arthritis?

619
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,473
- Ain't I got enough?
<i>- (man calls out greeting)</i>

620
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,433
Adrian's too good for this.

621
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,676
This place really depresses me, Paul.

622
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,872
Rock! Come in. Everybody's been
askin' for ya. You too, Paulie.

623
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,117
- No, thanks. I'm a little beat.
- Hey, I'm a little thirsty.

624
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,992
- You go if you wanna.
- Mr Balboa?

625
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,590
- Look at this. Tommy Gunn.
- Why are you still hanging around?

626
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,271
- Is there somethin' I can do for you?
- Yeah. I'd like to try again.

627
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,234
Kid, I'd like to help, but I really
don't know nothin' about managing.

628
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:56,036
Man, all I'm askin' for is a chance.
If I screw up, then hell, I'll leave.

629
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,119
- What have you got to lose?
- Me? Nothin'. It's what <i>you</i> got to lose.

630
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,196
- I got nothin' to lose.
- Maybe you do.

631
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,995
What if I don't do good, right?
And you don't make it?

632
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,271
I don't want you blaming me
for this, kid, you know?

633
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:13,678
Here's what I would do if I was you.
Listen to me. If I was you...

634
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,191
...I would go home and talk to your family
people. Come up with somethin' better.

635
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,517
I got no family people.
All I got is what you see here.

636
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,269
I know all about you, back from
your first fight with Apollo Creed.

637
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,153
I read how nobody cared about you
or gave you a chance.

638
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,955
I'm not from the same streets as you,
but I'm hungry, like you were.

639
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,389
Ever since I put on gloves
I've wanted to meet you.

640
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:38,672
Cos I knew that if anybody could
make me a winner, it was you.

641
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,598
Hey, Paulie,
you see a winner standing here?

642
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,156
Yes! Man, you beat the best.
Nobody could ever say different.

643
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,193
Look, Rocky, you don't know me,
but anything you want me to do, I'll do.

644
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,550
And if I can't, I'll bust my butt tryin'.

645
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:57,676
I'm not hustlin' you, man. All I'm askin'
for is a chance. I mean, just one shot.

646
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,310
Are you hungry?

647
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,993
Yeah.

648
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,953
Yeah? Come on.

649
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,799
You're really gonna like
the way Adrian cooks.

650
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,674
She does amazing things with macaroni,
especially tomatoes.

651
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,952
But I gotta warn you,
she can be a little vicious with the garlic!

652
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:31,917
- So why'd this kid smack your face?
- It really doesn't matter, Dad.

653
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,237
- It does matter. They took his coat.
- I don't want the coat.

654
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,316
They took the one with the collar?

655
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,079
- I'll go to your school and...
- You'll make it worse!

656
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,351
- Can't I do what I think is right?
- What do you think is right?

657
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,233
- A baseball bat across the face.
- Paulie!

658
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,669
- Adrian, can I have the plate?
- Yes, Rocky.

659
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,314
I had trouble like that
when I was in school.

660
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,228
Every day I got chased by this kid,
till one day my mother said to me:

661
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,238
- "Pretend the guy's like a balloon."
- Balloon?

662
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:02,239
She said if you pop 'em hard,
these guys just go away.

663
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,388
Tommy, we're trying to raise our son
so he can handle his problems...

664
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,080
...with his mind, not his muscles.

665
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,236
- Sorry.
- That's why I'll get mangled.

666
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,955
- You ain't gonna get mangled.
- Dad, will you teach me how to fight?

667
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,718
A baseball bat would be nice.

668
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,673
Do you wanna grow up
and just use your fists?

669
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,075
Adrian, I don't think it'd be so bad...

670
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,113
...if I taught him how to throw a few...
deadly punches.

671
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,674
Tommy, did your dad teach you to fight?

672
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,395
- No, not exactly. I had to...
- Sweetheart, don't get personal.

673
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,149
No, it's OK. You see, my old man,
he used to drink a lot. Seriously.

674
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,512
He'd go out with his friends, then
he'd come home, look to punch on me.

675
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:45,189
He'd punch on my mother too.
He did that a lot of times.

676
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,551
So growin' up,
I only thought about fightin' my father.

677
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,592
You know, when I was 13,
I got in trouble at school.

678
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,076
He tied me down and whipped me
so bad I couldn't walk for a week.

679
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,668
I couldn't do anything.

680
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:03,318
The first guy I ever knocked out was my
father. In the ring, it's like all I see is him.

681
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,991
That's... kinda sick, huh?

682
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,708
Yo, Tommy, at least you had
an old man to knock out, you know?

683
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,596
Yeah.

684
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,996
- I didn't even have that.
- Some day you can punch out <i>your</i> pop.

685
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:24,513
- Paulie, what you telling him that for?
- It's the fittest of the survival.

686
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:30,158
- Tommy, where you stayin' tonight?
- Oh, I'll find some place to stay.

687
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,989
No, I tell you what.
We got room down in the basement.

688
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,554
- What about me?
- Your son is sleeping there.

689
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:40,798
- Well, he can stay with his uncle.
- What am I? A pit stop?!

690
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,037
I don't wanna cause any problems.
I can find a place to stay.

691
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,199
No, it's OK. It's just for...
a little while, you know.

692
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:52,677
Right? No problem at all. Hey, kid.
I appreciate it. It's cold outside.

693
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,396
- I'm not changin' no sheets.
- Hey, since when have you ever?

694
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,229
Tommy, why don't you come on down?
We'll show you the whole place.

695
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:06,388
Why don't you go downstairs,
show your father what you did today?

696
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,951
Hey, Junior!
Your plumbing don't leak, do it?

697
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,279
- You know this guy?
- Yeah. He hits hard.

698
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,111
- Adrian can really cook!
- Yeah, she's OK. Listen, Tommy.

699
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,755
We ain't had a chance
to get this place too nice.

700
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,111
We'll get it together in a while, you know?

701
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:38,198
- Wow! Man, this is what it's about.
- Holy mackerel!

702
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,959
Why do you keep this stuff down here?

703
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:45,119
When did you get a chance to do this?
He took it all out of a box. It's beautiful.

704
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,755
You painted... When did you get
a chance to do this, kid?

705
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,475
- After school. It's no big deal.
- Where'd you get the glove?

706
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,275
Oh, this? Thanks.
This is one of my favourite objects.

707
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,791
Mickey give me this before he departed.
It was Rocky Marciano's cuff link.

708
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,595
- Really? The real Rocky Marciano?
- You got me thinkin' about Mickey.

709
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,951
I wanna show you somethin'.
He told me a long time ago...

710
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:13,313
He says that fighting
is like 90% in the skull...

711
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,874
...and 10% in the body.
This is what he says to me.

712
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,834
- Dad, I met this really nice girl today.
- Really? That's wonderful.

713
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:23,669
- She's a lot better than...
- Wait a minute. Don't change the station.

714
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,951
I'll be right back.
I just wanna tell Tommy a few things.

715
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:30,675
Hey, who was your best friend
back in Orlando?

716
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,872
- Uh, that's Oklahoma.
- Well, yeah.

717
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,275
- Um, Eric Elder.
- No, no, no, no.

718
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,868
Your best friend is
a guy named Frankie Fear.

719
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,437
You see, fear is a fighter's best friend.
It ain't nothin' to be ashamed of.

720
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:48,395
You see, fear keeps you sharp. It keeps
you awake. It makes you wanna survive.

721
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,751
But the thing is,
you gotta learn how to control it.

722
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:55,350
Cos fear is like this fire
and it's burning deep inside.

723
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:58,472
Now, if you control it, Tommy,
it's gonna make you hot.

724
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:01,194
But, you see,
if this thing here controls you...

725
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:05,438
...it's gonna burn you and everything
else around you up. That's right.

726
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,677
Anyway, these are the things
that was taught to me...

727
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,156
...and, if you want, I'd like to teach to you.

728
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,794
Does, uh...
this mean you're gonna manage me?

729
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,037
- Absolutely. Hey, home team.
- All right!

730
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,357
- Let's go for it.
- Do you mind showin' me a few things?

731
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,835
Sure, Tommy. I'll show you a lot of things.

732
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,752
Hey, rich boy!
How much you got in your pocket today?

733
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,711
- Nothin'.
- Come on, let's have it.

734
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,479
- I got nothin'.
- Come on, gimme the money.

735
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,034
- Come on!
- Hey, I gotta eat.

736
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,118
He's hungry, he's gotta eat. Well, eat this.

737
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,076
I got it. Go!

738
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,510
Father Carmine! Yo!

739
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,278
Father Carmine!

740
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,755
- Maybe he's not home.
- Priests is always home.

741
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,155
- Oh, Rocky!
- Yo!

742
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,555
<i>Ma perché non battesti la porta?</i>

743
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,319
I didn't wanna
disturb you that much, Father.

744
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,715
<i>Che disturbo! E la famiglia, com'e?</i>

745
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,593
Oh, excellent. Everything is perfect.

746
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,029
Father, this is my new friend,
Tommy Gunn.

747
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,958
<i>Tanto piacere di fare la conoscenza!</i>

748
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,719
<i>- Che posso fare per te, Rocky?</i>
- I was wondering...

749
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,798
Tommy here's a fighter
and I'm his manager.

750
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,798
I wondered if you'd do me a favour,
if you ain't busy.

751
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,675
Could you throw us a couple blessings?
One, that I don't mess up as a manager.

752
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,270
And B, that Tommy does
as good as I think he can do: Great.

753
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,518
- And don't get hurt. Could you do that?
<i>- Ma sicuro! 'U piacere e mio!</i>

754
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:40,237
<i>In nome del padre, del figlio e</i>
<i>dello spirito santo... E cosi sia.</i>

755
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:44,114
I love it when he does that.
Thanks, Father! Really appreciate this!

756
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,949
- <i>Tanto piacere.</i> Any time.
- OK. I'll see you in church.

757
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,311
<i>Si, sicuramente. Venite tutti due!</i>

758
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:56,389
- Hey, man, what'd you do this for?
- It don't hurt havin' an angel on your side.

759
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,794
- Hey, Rock! How's it goin'?
- Doin' great, guys!

760
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,717
Slow down or you'll get a ticket!

761
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:07,991
- This is Tommy Gunn. He'll be a champ.
- How you doin', Tom?

762
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,676
<i>(bell)</i>

763
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,433
All right, break it up! Break! Break!

764
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,151
Get off the ropes!

765
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,077
- Go easy.
- Man, I need more work.

766
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,998
- No, you're ready.
- No, this guy's killin' me.

767
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:49,112
- You're ready now. You're perfect.
- He's killin' me!

768
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,879
- I feel weak.
- No, listen to me. Shut up!

769
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,470
Mick used to say the only difference
between a hero and a coward...

770
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,478
...is the hero's willing to
go for it. Take the shot.

771
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,319
This guy here is scared too.
You're both scared.

772
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,479
Remember in the basement we talked
about fear? How it was like this fire?

773
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:09,195
You gotta control it or it burns you up.
Or it's gonna burn him up.

774
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,151
Make it work for you, Tommy.

775
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,317
I would never do nothin'
to hurt you, understand?

776
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:18,672
Fear is like this fire, OK? Now let it burn
until it becomes like this volcano.

777
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,349
When you see the openin',
explode all over this guy, OK?

778
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,234
Now, you can take him, OK?
It ain't all muscle, it's all heart.

779
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:30,069
Heart and fire! Heart and fire!
OK, now you do it!

780
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,679
Remember,
I'm like this angel on your shoulder.

781
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,872
I ain't gonna let nothin'
happen to you. Go for it!

782
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,549

00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,474

It seems there's no formal contract

keep goin' the way you're goin'...

950
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:30,391
...you're gonna be
watchin' the parade go by.

951
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:33,990
- Exactly.
- You haven't had the big payday yet.

952
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:39,114
And you won't until you fight those
top contenders that I do surely own.

953
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,035
I got the contracts.

954
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,276
It's a complex business.

955
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,039
But if you want the best, go with the best.

956
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:49,720
- What about Rocky?
- Rocky can still train you.

957
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:54,436
My God, he's done a wonderful job.
Now look, here's $20,000.

958
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,915
Take it as an advance.

959
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:02,078
Time to put some hustle
behind this muscle. Merry Christmas.

960
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,156
Merry Christmas.

961
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,080
Stop the presses!
Yo, Adrian, I can't believe it.

962
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:12,512
Just come up on the roof, will you?
He just landed there and crashed.

963
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:16,269
- Who do you think it is?
- Do I hear reindeer on my roof?

964
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,072
You know...

965
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:21,397
Antlers. Unbelievable. It's like a billion...

966
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:24,990
Whoa! Come on. Look who's here.
You know this guy!

967
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:27,634
- You got a weird family.
- Don't I know?

968
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:32,993
It's gonna be next Christmas before he
gets down. Hey, put it together for Santa!

969
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:36,556
- Merry Xmas. Yo, yo, yo!
- I don't think you got it right, Santa.

970
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:40,593
- No, no, no. It's "Ho, ho, ho!"
- What's the freakin' difference?

971
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:44,872
- Where I come from it's "Yo, yo, yo!"
- Looks like we got a 90 proof Santa.

972
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,118
Hey, Santa, tell all the kids
what you've got in the bag for them...

973
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:52,550
...that you brought from the north.
- I got my laundry.

974
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:55,956
- No, you got the wrong bag.
- Come on, Chubby. Get outta the way.

975
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,389
Let Santa sit down. Come here, little boy.

976
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:00,954
- You been nice?
- Uncle Paulie!

977
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:05,073
- Kid, why not tell Santa what you need?
- He's stretchin' the clothes, man.

978
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:09,034
- I don't need nothin'.
- Come on, kid. Tell Santa what you want.

979
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:12,311
That ain't Santa.
It's Uncle Paulie. Let's get real.

980
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:15,034
What do you mean?
Why are you talkin' like that?

981
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:19,199
We're just tryin' to have a good time.
Santa's here and everything...

982
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:21,436
It's stupid!

983
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:25,792
Yo, you know... Come on, it ain't stupid.
We're just tryin' to pretend here.

984
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:30,550
You see, you're supposed to be
pretending. It's like this game, right?

985
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:33,148
I don't like pretending.
You guys talk to Santa.

986
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:37,159
Hey, kid, I ain't talkin' to them.
I'm talkin' with <i>you</i> here.

987
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,511
See, it's very important that
you spend time with the family...

988
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:45,191
...and have a good time and just get the
spirit goin', you know? It's good, right?

989
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:47,675
Good for what? Come on, let's go.

990
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,315
His friends are here. He doesn't want to.

991
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:55,115
- Adrian, I know what he wants.
- How do you know what I want?

992
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,879
- Cos I know you.
- You know me?

993
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,956
He thinks he knows me.

994
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:05,951
- Look, I ain't celebratin' nothin', OK?
- Hey, wait. What's the matter with you?

995
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:10,756
We always done this before. We always
had a good time. It don't have to change.

996
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:15,510
Do you remember last year, when
we had fun, when we had a good time?

997
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:18,837
It ain't last year and
you ain't the same either.

998
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,914
What?!

999
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:27,753
Adrian, what did I do?

1000
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,836
Go talk to him.

1001
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,710
Even I coulda saw this thing happening.

1002
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,752
I shoulda went to Miami
when I had the chance.

1003
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,394
You wanna talk? Let's talk.

1004
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:46,194
Well, you know,
I thought we was supposed to be like...

1005
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:49,232
You know, be very close.
Hey, come on, kid. I love you.

1006
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,316
No, you don't.

1007
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,908
Sure I do. Remember what the deal was?

1008
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:57,749
We was supposed to be tight,
like crossed fingers.

1009
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:01,589
You want you and Tommy to be tight.
That's what you're talkin' about.

1010
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,790
- Oh, don't say that!
- Why can't I say it?

1011
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,195
Since he came it's Tommy this,
Tommy that.

1012
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:09,073
You got no time for nobody,
so I got no time for you.

1013
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,873
What are you sayin'?
You're like another person.

1014
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,437
<i>You're</i> the other person. You said I would
be number one to you and you lied!

1015
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,551
You lied to me and you lied to Mom!

1016
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:22,031
I never lied to you.
Tommy needed my help.

1017
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,311
So did I.

1018
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:28,069
And remember when you said to
watch out for scams and deceptions?

1019
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:29,553
Yeah?

1020
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:32,433
<i>You're</i> the one that shoulda watched out.

1021
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:40,793
- Where are you going?
- Out!

1022
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:42,592
- When'll you be back?
- Later.

1023
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,676
- Later? When?
- Later.

1024
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:51,674
Season's greetings, Mrs Balboa!

1025
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,434
You take care of these people.

1026
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,313
Behold the Santa for all seasons!

1027
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,951
Are you guys lost?

1028
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:06,277
<i>Au contraire, mon ami.</i>
I know exactly where I am.

1029
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:12,835
Yo, Rocko! Guess what's comin' to dinner.
Tommy Gunn's got new friends.

1030
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,996
<i>(Duke)</i> New friends for a new year!

1031
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:18,438
Oh, please. Oh, Paulie!

1032
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,670
Nice tree. Charming.

1033
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:27,111
- Hey, Tommy. How you doin'?
- Merry Christmas, milord. Greetings!

1034
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:29,151
- Yeah, how you doin'?
- Listen.

1035
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:32,636
I don't want to take up too much time.
Season's greetings.

1036
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:36,196
- I don't need no presents.
- You've done a helluva job with the man.

1037
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:40,871
Facts are facts. I'd have to be blind
if I didn't see a title shot on the cards.

1038
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,992
- Title shot?
- Right. We'll work beautifully together.

1039
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:46,315
No problems.

1040
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:51,878
No friction. Only harmony, huh? It's time
to put some hustle behind this muscle.

1041
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:55,990
Tommy-boy's got a little something
personal to discuss with you.

1042
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:59,078
So I'm gonna be sayin' good night.
Merry Christmas.

1043
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,158
- Merry Christmas to you.
- See you soon, huh?

1044
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:06,233
Sorry I'm late.
I got hung up havin' dinner.

1045
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:10,797
Hey, that's OK, Tommy. Adrian cooked
somethin', but it's probably all cold.

1046
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:15,994
- What we can do is make sandwiches.
- Rocky, I don't wanna make sandwiches.

1047
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:18,315
Tommy, why did you bring him here?

1048
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:22,877
He just wanted to come by. Rocky, mind
if I talk to you outside about a few things?

1049
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,956
Oh, yeah. Sure.

1050
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:27,389
It's getting late.
We have to be there by ten.

1051
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,875
- Rocky...
- No, it's OK.

1052
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:35,595
Hey, Tommy,
what do you wanna talk to me about?

1053
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,711
- Isn't it a long drive?
- Yeah.

1054
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:40,479
So, uh... what do you think?

1055
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,830
- Where'd you get this?
- Duke gave it to me.

1056
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:44,632
Tommy...!

1057
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:47,479
Hey, maybe you oughta
give this thing back.

1058
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,591
Man, I knew it! I knew you'd say that.

1059
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:52,359
Give it back? Why?
He likes the way I fight.

1060
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:54,436
- It's almost ten.
- We'll make it.

1061
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,755
I know, but you see what he's doin' here?

1062
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:00,509
Tommy, hey,
don't let him put nothin' between us, OK?

1063
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:04,155
Put like what? The guy was
just talking about getting a shot.

1064
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:07,636
Look, we don't need him.
I mean, you're gonna get a shot.

1065
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,716
You'll be able to buy ten of these.

1066
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:12,957
When you gonna wake up?
We're watchin' the parade go by.

1067
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,674
What parade? What are you talkin' about?

1068
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:19,554
The big time. The way I'm goin',
I won't get a shot for a long time.

1069
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:22,990
I've got a perfect record.
I'm 22 and 0. Where's the money?

1070
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:26,795
Where? We haven't made serious money.
And we won't without the man.

1071
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:31,596
I ain't talkin' about money. It'll be there.
I'm talkin' about your rep, Tommy.

1072
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:35,998
- Don't sell out. We don't need this guy.
- Listen. Duke is a wonderful man.

1073
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:38,270
- Put the top up.
- Forget about the top!

1074
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:42,916
- I'm signin' papers with him tomorrow.
- You sign them, you're like his property.

1075
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:47,795
You got no control. This is a dirty
business, full of thieves and gangsters.

1076
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:53,756
They promise every good young fighter
who comes by, they promise the world.

1077
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:58,112
And then they suck 'em dry and
they leave 'em in the gutter broke.

1078
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:00,276
That's the way this business is run.

1079
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:05,428
Guys like Duke... You know what he is?
He's a vampire. He's livin' off your blood.

1080
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:09,189
Tommy, you know, the thing I'm
tryin' to do is what Mick done for me.

1081
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:12,676
He tried to keep me away from
the dirty part of the business...

1082
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:16,315
...the way I'm tryin' to do for you.
- I ain't you. And you ain't Mick.

1083
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:20,558
When are you gonna understand this is
a business? And in business you need...

1084
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:23,069
- What, brains?
- You said that, not me.

1085
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:27,830
- You saying I got no brains?
- Duke gave me my title shot, you didn't.

1086
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,599
If you wanna keep trainin' me, do it.
If not, don't!

1087
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:33,154
But it's my way or it's the highway.

1088
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,119
Tommy!

1089
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:37,754
<i>(intense ringing)</i>

1090
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,788
Rocky, put on your coat.

1091
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:49,799
Just put on your coat.
Come on. It's not worth it.

1092
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,115
Adrian, it is worth it. The kid's confused.

1093
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:54,993
- You don't see what's happening.
- Yeah, I do see!

1094
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:58,510
- He's twisted around by Duke.
- Come on, it's you. It's not him.

1095
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:02,758
You can't live backwards or turn back
the clocks. We live now. We live here.

1096
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,678
Hey, I know where we live!
Do you think I'm stupid?

1097
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,756
I'm not as dumb as you think I am!

1098
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:11,509
I look. You don't think I can smell it?
I see where we are!

1099
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:16,031
I don't want this no more! I want
something good for the family, not this!

1100
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:20,392
I don't want this! Did I come back here
and get my brains beat out...

1101
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:25,435
...for guys to say "There goes Balboa,
just another bum in the neighbourhood"?

1102
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:29,348
- I didn't want this!
- No! Come on, nobody says that.

1103
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:33,473
I'm sayin' it, Adrian.
I'm sayin' this! I'm sayin' this.

1104
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:37,479
When that kid was in the ring,
you know what I was doin'? I was winnin'.

1105
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,556
- You were winning?
- Yeah, it was...

1106
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:42,911
It was my last chance
at gettin' some respect for us.

1107
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:46,271
- Come on. I respect you!
- You can't respect me.

1108
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:49,392
- Yes, I do.
- No, you can't! Don't tell me that.

1109
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:55,038
All those beatings you took in the ring,
I took them with you. I know how you feel.

1110
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:59,039
I know when somebody like Tommy
comes along, you feel alive.

1111
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:01,594
But he's not you.
He doesn't have your heart.

1112
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:07,033
All those fighters you beat, you beat 'em
with heart, not muscle. Mickey knew that.

1113
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:11,517
That's why you and Mickey were special.
But Mickey's dead!

1114
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:16,634
If there's something you wanna pass on,
pass it on to your son, for God's sakes!

1115
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:18,830
Your son is lost.

1116
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,155
He needs <i>you.</i>

1117
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:26,559
I know Tommy makes you feel great. He
makes you feel like you're winning again.

1118
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,910
But you're losing us!

1119
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,713
Rocky, you're losing your family!

1120
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,995
I'm sorry.

1121
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:45,079
You know, it was always you and me.
It was always you and me.

1122
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,356
I'm sorry, Adrian.

1123
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:53,471
I don't know about you guys...

1124
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,516
...but I gotta get outta here.

1125
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:01,351
- What do you say we go to the shore?
- Oh, yeah, great(!)

1126
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:03,994
- How are we gonna get there?
- What do you mean?

1127
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:06,714
We throw our thumbs
in the air and hitchhike.

1128
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,354
- Uh, yo!
- Oh, what's he want?

1129
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,948
- You want me to stay with you?
- No.

1130
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:15,755
You're right. I got enough problems
with <i>my</i> old man. Come on.

1131
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:20,679
- You ain't gonna hit him, are you?
- No, I ain't gonna hit him.

1132
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:24,793
Yo, kid. When you start smokin'?

1133
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:30,313
- I don't know. Didn't you ever smoke?
- Uh, yeah. I done a lot of bad things.

1134
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,396
So?

1135
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,989
So I... I wised up.

1136
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,873
OK, so maybe I'll wise up someday too.

1137
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:45,715
Maybe tonight's a good night
for both of us to start wisin' up.

1138
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:49,194
- Don't worry about it.
- I gotta worry about it.

1139
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,515
The deal was we were
supposed to be tight.

1140
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:54,598
What about Tommy?
You're tight with him too, huh?

1141
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,876
Tommy.

1142
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,436
Yeah, well...

1143
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:06,595
That was yesterday, you know?

1144
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:12,070
You know, kid...

1145
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:15,351
Remember you told me
a long time ago about deceptions?

1146
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:17,835
And I was talking to you about scams?

1147
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:22,238
I shoulda listened to you.
I was tryin' to teach you, all right?

1148
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:25,158
But you were teachin' me
and I didn't wise up.

1149
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:29,239
I didn't know and I made mistakes.
And I do things, you know...

1150
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:34,349
It bothers me, you know?
I forget a lot of things and I...

1151
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:37,233
I... just...

1152
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,589
Hey, kid.

1153
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:53,193
I know I made a few mistakes, you know?

1154
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:58,591
But I would love to hang out
with you again. Just you and me.

1155
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,476
I swear to God.

1156
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:07,876
It's just gonna be you and me this time.

1157
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:11,316
Home team?

1158
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,678
Yeah. Home team.

1159
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:22,275
- Hey, kid, you wanna hear a joke?
- Yeah, sure. Why not?

1160
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,868
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

1161
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,719
- Tuna fish.
- Tuna fish who?

1162
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,674
You can tune a piano,
but you cannot tune a fish.

1163
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:35,395
- Well, you're gettin' better.
- Yeah. That's a good one.

1164
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:45,990
All right, folks. Lock the door and
hide the kids. It's time to wage war!

1165
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:51,592
<i>Tommy Gunn is such a student</i>
<i>of Rocky Balboa's style...</i>

1166
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:55,110
<i>... he's been nicknamed</i>
<i>by the press the Clone Ranger.</i>

1167
01:15:56,160 --> 01:16:00,950
- Relax, Rocko. He ain't worth the stress.
- It ain't him, Paulie.

1168
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:02,479
<i>... turbocharged.</i>

1169
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,672
Tommy "The Machine" Gunn!

1170
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:09,080
<i>(booing, some cheering)</i>

1171
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:15,831
<i>Looks like the fans are unhappy with</i>
<i>Tommy Gunn for leaving Rocky Balboa.</i>

1172
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:19,111
<i>(laughs)</i> Of course.
He's nobody's sweetheart, that kid.

1173
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:23,438
<i>Weighing in at 242</i>
<i>very impressive pounds...</i>

1174
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,832
...the present world
heavyweight champion...

1175
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,633
...Union Cane!

1176
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:33,998
- Looks like he's in great shape, don't he?
- Yeah.

1177
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:36,873
<i>The referee calling</i>
<i>both fighters to the centre.</i>

1178
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,039
Tommy, you're lookin' a little tight.
He's nervous, you know?

1179
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:44,038
Like the way I felt when
I was fightin' with Apollo.

1180
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:46,310
Rocko, he ain't you and he never was.

1181
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:48,431
- Give him a break, would you?
<i>- (bell)</i>

1182
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:59,591
Come on, Tommy. Do what you was told.
In and out. Side to side. Don't eat the jab.

1183
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,916
Off the ropes! Are you blind?

1184
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:10,035
- He's gettin' hit with everythin'.
- Come on, Cane. Go for it.

1185
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:12,151
Come on, Tommy. What's the matter?

1186
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:13,759
That's it!

1187
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,552
That's it!

1188
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:25,549
Slip the jab. Move side to side. Back
and forth, like a metronome. Slip, slide.

1189
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:27,799
That's it!

1190
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:43,512
You see? He remembers everything.

1191
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:47,872
Come on, Tommy. I'm in there, man.
Do what I'm doin'. Back and forth.

1192
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,150
Side to side. That's it.

1193
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,637
Come on, kid! Don't let him off!

1194
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:05,719
Dig! Dig!

1195
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:18,318
- Got him!
<i>- The heavyweight champion is down!</i>

1196
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:23,192
One! Two!

1197
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:25,596
Three! Four!

1198
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:27,676
- Five!
- Six!

1199
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,552
- Seven!
- Eight!

1200
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:32,428
- Nine!
- Ten! You're out!

1201
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,995
Yow! Yow!

1202
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:40,235
Yeah!

1203
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:46,872
Ladies and gentlemen, by way of
a knockout, we have a new champion...

1204
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,594
...Tommy "The Machine" Gunn!

1205
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:51,756
<i>(booing)</i>

1206
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:56,234
<i>Congratulations.</i>
<i>A sensational upset victory.</i>

1207
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:58,874
<i>You're now champion of the world.</i>
<i>How do you feel?</i>

1208
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,753
<i>Never better. I don't know</i>
<i>what's wrong with these people.</i>

1209
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:05,475
Because you're not a champeen.
You're a crumb-bum dirt bag.

1210
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:09,957
Come on, Paulie. Give him a break.
He did something... wonderful.

1211
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,355
<i>Long live the king! Yeah!</i>

1212
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:16,393
<i>I'd like to say thank you. I'd like to</i>
<i>thank the man who made this happen...</i>

1213
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:21,469
<i>... and made me believe it could happen.</i>
<i>He's been like an angel on my shoulder.</i>

1214
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,592
<i>Mr George Washington Duke!</i>

1215
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:26,280
<i>(booing)</i>

1216
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:31,190
<i>And there you have it. A new champion of</i>
<i>the world, Tommy "The Machine" Gunn.</i>

1217
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:33,675
<i>I'll tell ya, a big surprise, at least to me...</i>

1218
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:37,588
<i>... that the new champion thanked Duke</i>
<i>instead of the guy that got him there.</i>

1219
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:40,951
<i>- This crowd is not happy.</i>
<i>- (crowd) Rocky! Rocky!</i>

1220
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:48,119
- Rocko, too much TV's bad for the eyes.
- My eyes are OK, Paulie.

1221
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:51,198
- Well, too much TV is bad for my ears.
- Yeah.

1222
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:55,477
- Hey, slugger. Good fight, huh?
- It's OK, Dad.

1223
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,875
You're the real champ.
I made this for you.

1224
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,036
Oh, yeah?

1225
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:02,515
Beautiful.

1226
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:05,313
Rocko, let's put our teeth
around a few brews, OK?

1227
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:08,796
- I could use the company.
- <i>(Adrian)</i> Yeah, good idea.

1228
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:13,395
- Think I should go out with Uncle Paulie?
- If I can watch TV.

1229
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:17,832
OK, listen. You can watch TV, OK?
But don't stay up too late.

1230
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:21,316
- You gotta get them bones growin'.
- All right.

1231
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:25,790
- Wow! What a fight. It was somethin'.
- Somethin'.

1232
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,473
I told you you could
give him everything but you.

1233
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:32,831
- You can't give him your heart.
- Oh, it's OK, Adrian. Really.

1234
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,918
- Yeah?
- Yeah. It's... It's all right.

1235
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,558
Hey, kid. Don't you stay up too late, OK?

1236
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,716
That was some fight.

1237
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,915
- Are you OK?
- Oh, sure.

1238
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:51,800
- I won't be out too late.
- OK.

1239
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,797
See you, champ.

1240
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,878
- Have a good time with Uncle Paulie.
- Yeah.

1241
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:07,631
Let me present the newest, the youngest
heavyweight champion of all time...

1242
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,115
...Tommy "The Machine" Gunn!

1243
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:14,791
- Do you think it was too easy?
- I took some shots, but I was never hurt.

1244
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:16,876
I'm just glad to be the champ.

1245
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,994
Don't you think this looked like more like
a sparring session than a championship?

1246
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:24,953
- It didn't look like you broke a sweat.
- Very observant.

1247
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,116
Union Cane wasn't feeling that good.

1248
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:31,199
But Tommy Gunn would have done
the same thing if Union was 100%.

1249
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:34,596
100%?! He fought like
he didn't have a heartbeat!

1250
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,836
We all know Cane is a paper champion.

1251
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:40,111
- What do you mean?
- Cane's title was manufactured.

1252
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:43,391
- He never won it from Balboa.
- Gentlemen, give him a break.

1253
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:46,512
Will you ever get out
from underneath Balboa's shadow?

1254
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:51,794
- I won the title. What more do you want?
- You've gotta fight some real opponents.

1255
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,956
But I beat the best tonight!

1256
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:57,755
The best? This guy's a bum.
He doesn't even deserve a title shot.

1257
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:02,795
Gentlemen, whoa! We're gettin' carried
away. Cane was the recognised champ.

1258
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:05,593
We know the ratings system
can be manipulated.

1259
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:08,393
Fact is, Tommy Gunn
beat a second-rate fighter...

1260
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:11,876
...with so much glass in his jaw,
he oughta be a chandelier.

1261
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,468
This man will prove
to be a great champion!

1262
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:17,956
He might win a few fights,
but a Rocky Balboa he'll never be.

1263
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,036
No, he's no Rocky Balboa.

1264
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:23,789
Let's face it. There's only one Balboa.
He was a true people's champion.

1265
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:27,749
But in time Tommy Gunn may be
able to fill his shoes. Next question.

1266
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:31,793
- Not by fighting stiffs like Cane, he won't!
- I'll fight anybody, anywhere!

1267
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:34,434
When are you gonna fight a real fighter?

1268
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:39,111
Gentlemen, come on. Thank you for
coming tonight. We look forward to...

1269
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:41,196
Hey, Tommy, I got somethin' for ya.

1270
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:46,758
For your next fight, try the redhead in the
front row. I hear she comes real cheap.

1271
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:50,793
We look forward to seeing you
at Tommy Gunn's next fight.

1272
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:53,480
Why did you say Balboa's better?
Do you believe that?

1273
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:56,194
Of course not. Look, we can't talk in here.

1274
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:59,278
<i>(reporter)</i> Who are you gonna
fight next, Tommy?

1275
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:03,518
What the hell happened in there? I won
the damn title and they think I'm a bum!

1276
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:07,030
- Why didn't you back me up?
- When the press is right, they're right.

1277
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:11,312
I'm as good as Balboa ever was and
I'm tired of being called a damn robot!

1278
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:14,910
Listen, Tommy. You can't fight the press.
<i>I</i> can't fight them.

1279
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:19,272
As long as they got Balboa on the brain,
he's champ. He fought wars in the ring.

1280
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:21,595
Tommy, face facts. You're in his shadow.

1281
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:23,950
- This is your own man talking!
- Listen to me.

1282
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:28,995
There is a way to get the respect
you deserve. Challenge Balboa to fight.

1283
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:33,033
- George could set it up in just weeks.
- It'd be the greatest fight ever.

1284
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:36,197
Teacher against student,
old lion against young lion.

1285
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:39,357
That's the only way
you ever gonna get peace of mind.

1286
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:43,712
That press will hound you with that man's
legend for as long as you wear gloves.

1287
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:48,470
You gotta get him into that ring, Tommy,
or you'll keep hearing questions like that.

1288
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:52,479
Then you'll start to ask <i>yourself</i>
"Could I take him? Am I good enough?"

1289
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:54,556
"Do people think I'm a carbon copy...

1290
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:59,231
...or a second-rate pretender who only
got a shot because of my skin tone?"

1291
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,669
Got to challenge
that man to fight, Tommy.

1292
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:06,510
If he refuses, you gotta insult him, you
gotta dog him, you gotta humiliate him!

1293
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:11,589
Do whatever you got to do to get him into
that ring! But that's what you got to do.

1294
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:19,388
<i>(Rocky)</i> OK. Blast off.
Rollin' silver. And down!

1295
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,829
Andy, these flippers ain't flippin'.

1296
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:26,192
- That machine cost me a fortune.
- It's costin' me a fortune too.

1297
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:28,595
<i>- (Duke)</i> Rocky Balboa!
- <i>(Andy)</i> What was that?

1298
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:32,430
Rocky Balboa! There's a man out here
wishin' to speak with you.

1299
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,994
Rocky Balboa!

1300
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,868
Rocko, you know who that is, huh?

1301
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,150
Yeah, I know who that is.

1302
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:48,472
- Rocky, you need some help?
- No, guys. It ain't no pie-eatin' contest.

1303
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,870
<i>(Paulie)</i> Look what's in the street.

1304
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,117
Tommy, what are you doin' here?
You oughta be celebratin'.

1305
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:59,676
I'm challenging you to a fight.
Any time, any place, anywhere.

1306
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:01,631
- Fight?
- That's right.

1307
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:05,992
You're comin' here with these people
askin' if I wanna throw hands with you?

1308
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:09,271
- Is that what this is about?
- Yeah. And I ain't nobody's robot.

1309
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:13,837
Nobody's boy! Now are you accepting
the challenge or are you yellow?

1310
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:17,873
He has no class. Come on, Rocko.
Hey, he has no class! Come on.

1311
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:30,715
Hey, it ain't him. You wanna
shoot some eightball or somethin'?

1312
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:33,752
Hey! I ain't through talkin' with you yet!

1313
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:36,189
Look, I ain't got
no more to say to you, OK?

1314
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:40,472
- I wanted good things for you.
- Like hell. You're only in it for the money.

1315
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:43,194
I'm tired of walkin'
in your shadow like a robot!

1316
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:46,232
You thought I was in this
for the money, Tommy?

1317
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:49,079
We were supposed to be like brothers,
you know?

1318
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:51,555
You don't know it,
but you got a deception here.

1319
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:55,878
This guy was using you for the bait.
He wants to get you and me in the ring.

1320
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,231
He wants us to fight each other
to make the money.

1321
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:02,113
He don't care about you
and he don't care about me neither.

1322
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:05,312
Come on. Enough of the fantasy.
Let's talk reality.

1323
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:08,876
Rocky Balboa, are you prepared
to accept Tommy's challenge?

1324
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:13,357
- Tommy...
- Hey! I would have taken you any time.

1325
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:16,756
- You're a piece of garbage.
- This ain't none of your business.

1326
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,872
- None of my business?
- Come on, Paulie. Forget it.

1327
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,117
He spit blood for you,
put you ahead of his own family.

1328
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:26,949
And you bring these rat bums
around here? Kill his dignity?

1329
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:30,959
Rocko made you your shot.
He's the real champ. You're just a joke!

1330
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:33,310
Get out of here before I break your face.

1331
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:37,191
Paulie?

1332
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:41,676
- Don't break your hand on that bum!
- Paulie, are you OK?

1333
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:45,395
You shoulda left him on the street,
where you found him.

1334
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:49,999
- Merlin, get him outta here. Get him out!
- Get off of me!

1335
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:56,438
You knocked him down.
Why don't you try knockin' <i>me</i> down?

1336
01:26:56,560 --> 01:27:00,553
No, in the ring. Tommy Gunn only fights
in the ring! Let's get outta here.

1337
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:03,877
- My ring's outside.
- Yeah? Let's do it.

1338
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:07,556
Let's go live. Go live!

1339
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:17,508
- He's a punk, Rocky.
- He's a street fighter. You a prizefighter.

1340
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:20,074
- Don't be a damn fool.
- You don't own me!

1341
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:22,668
- You don't own me!
- What's wrong? Take it easy.

1342
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,633
Nobody does! I want my respect.

1343
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:28,593
Well, come and get it. Come on, Tommy.

1344
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:41,999
I loved you, man! Do you know that?

1345
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:45,749
You and me, we were supposed
to be like this, Tommy.

1346
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:47,836
You blew it! You...

1347
01:27:57,640 --> 01:28:01,838
Lucky punch. But I told you
never to fight a street fighter fight.

1348
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:05,748
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- You're always a champ, Rocky. Great.

1349
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:43,351
Great stuff. This is beautiful!

1350
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:46,150
Mom! Mom! It's Dad!

1351
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:48,510
- He's on TV. He's fighting!
- What?!

1352
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:51,756
Come on, man! Come on!

1353
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:56,434
Come on, Balboa! Who's your papa now?

1354
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,716
<i>- (ringing)</i>
- Come on! Come on!

1355
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,831
Come on, Balboa! Come on!

1356
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:07,913
<i>(distorted)</i> Come on!

1357
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:19,073
- Rocky, you gotta get up.
- Come on, get up!

1358
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:26,473
Come on!

1359
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,070
Rocky!

1360
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:37,071
You're out!

1361
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:40,796
If he dies, he dies.

1362
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:43,514
You're the champ.
Now get up. One more round!

1363
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:49,395
Get up! Don't lay down.
Fight this guy hard.

1364
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,511
Come on! Come on!

1365
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:54,108
He's no machine. I didn't hear no bell!

1366
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:57,437
Get up, you son of a bitch,
cos Mickey loves ya.

1367
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:10,876
Yo, Tommy!

1368
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:15,590
I didn't hear no bell.

1369
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:20,070
- One more round.
- Tommy, get back! Come on.

1370
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:22,873
- You don't need this.
- You lose, you're finished!

1371
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,434
I got one more round. Come on.

1372
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:29,633
I'm not gonna knock you out this time.
I'm gonna put you through the street.

1373
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,718
- One more round.
- Come on, Rocky!

1374
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:43,873
Come on, Tommy.

1375
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,956
Come on! Again!

1376
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:09,279
Come on, Tommy!

1377
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:20,955
Touch me and I'll sue.

1378
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:24,316
All right, Rocky. You've done it.

1379
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:28,911
What in the hell are you doin'?
Get up! What in the hell...?

1380
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:54,595
Come on, knock the bum out!
He took my room!

1381

Come on, Dad! You can beat him!

Fight back, you bum. Fight back!

<i>- Dio ti benedica!</i>

01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:06,919
- Runnin' up and down these steps.
- Dad...

1413
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:10,430
- Dad, we're gonna be late.
- Oh, yeah. OK.

1414
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:12,676
Hey, wait. What's wrong with your ear?

1415
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:16,349
- What's wrong with it?
- You got somethin' wrong, like a bump.

1416
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,630
What bump?

1417
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:20,432
This bump.

1418
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:26,638
- Thanks, Dad.
- Hey, you deserve it.

1419
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:30,719
Thank <i>you</i> for bein' born. Thank you.

1420
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:35,031
- What do you think? The new me?
- Well, uh...

1421
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:40,033
- You're the daughter I always wanted!
- What are you talkin' about?

1422
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:44,438
Hey, don't punch me. I'm gettin' brittle
as it is. Look at this, you know?

1423
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:47,120
I been runnin' up and down
these steps for 20 years.

1424
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:50,630
And I never knew there was
valuable pictures in this building.

1425
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:55,038
You're never too old to learn somethin'
new. You're gonna love Picasso.

1426
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:57,720
Oh, yeah. Well, I love almost everybody.

01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:22,911
# <i>Trusting your heart</i>

1443
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:26,430

1444
