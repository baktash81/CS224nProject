1
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,739
You're stuck on me and my laughing eyes

2
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:35,535
I can't pretend though I try to hide

3
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:41,541
I like you

4
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:47,880
I think I felt my heart skip a beat

5
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,467
l’m standing here and I can hardly breathe

6
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:57,807
You got me

7
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:05,148
The way you take my hand is just so sweet

8
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,612
And that crooked smile of yours

9
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:15,283
It knocks me off my feet

10
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:20,288
Oh, I just can't get enough

11
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:23,833
l’m a stew
I need to fill me up

12
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:28,171
It feels so good it must be love

13
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:31,090
It’s everything that l’ve been dreaming of

14
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:33,009
I give up, I give in

15
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,011
I let go
Let's begin

16
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,765
'Cause no matter what I do

17
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:44,854
My heart is filled with you

18
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:53,196
I hope we always feel this way

19
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,032
I know you will

20
00:01:56,116 --> 00:02:00,077
And in my heart I know that

21
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:03,080
You'll always stay

22
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,095
This is Sophie Hall from The New Yorker.

23
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,890
Hi, Mr. Beal. Thank you for calling me back.

24
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:25,394
No. L’m not a writer.
L’m a fact checker, actually.

25
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,940
It is a bit like being a detective, yes.

26
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:34,737
Let's see if you are the Robert Beal
that l’m looking for.

27
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:42,453
Can you confirm where you were
when you found out World War II was over?

28
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:48,292
Poughkeepsie? All right.
Right, thank you so much.

29
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,962
Yes, the moment the war ended.

30
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,840
Palm Beach? Okay. Lucky guy.

31
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,551
Thank you very much. Bye.

32
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,932
Bobby, hey, I got nothing,

33
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:06,519
but there's two more Robert Beals,
and one petty officer, third class.

34
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,146
Wait.

35
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,190
L’m gonna call you back.

36
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,067
Sophie Hall.

37
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:17,363
Can you confirm where you were
when you found out World War II was over?

38
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,366
Times Square?
L’m in Times Square right now.

39
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,202
L’m standing exactly
where the photograph was taken.

40
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,955
I really thought I would never find you.

41
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,959
So, can you... Can I ask you to describe
what you saw that day?

42
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:33,462
The kiss,
was it spontaneous or was it staged?

43
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,048
It was.

44
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,134
You're certain?

45
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,182
So you're 100% positive?

46
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:48,102
Petty Officer First Class Robert Beal,
who was the second sailor,

47
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,812
said that the nurse was the bee's knees

48
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,982
and that the kiss was
a completely spontaneous moment

49
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,318
and a celebration of real love.

50
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,904
- And he told you this himself?
- Yes, he did.

51
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,740
'Cause it's not often that I request
a personal audience with a fact checker.

52
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,283
It’s 'cause I need to know you're sure.

53
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,035
L’m 100% positive.

54
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,786
Great.

55
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,415
I guess people wanna believe in true love,
don't they?

56
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,584
Speaking of which, I understand
that you're headed off to Verona

57
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,044
for a pre-honeymoon?

58
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,587
Explain that to me.

59
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,173
It’s just a vacation before the wedding.

60
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,633
It’s our last chance to spend time alone

61
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:21,761
- before his restaurant...
- Well, it's the city of love, isn't it?

62
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,554
Yeah. But I...

63
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,848
Good choice, and good work. Thank you.

64
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,601
I was thinking. What if while l’m there,

65
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,603
I write?

66
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,855
But you're such a good fact checker.

67
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,609
- Have a great trip.
- Thank you. See you later.

68
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,989
Who goes on a honeymoon
without a wedding? You are so lucky.

69
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:45,576
Well, Victor's restaurant opens
in six weeks, so it's our last chance.

70
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:49,956
Okay, do not let him pay attention
to anything but you, okay?

71
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:53,250
- You throw his cell phone in the Adriatic.
- But he has to meet suppliers.

72
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,962
- Sophie...
- It’s fine. I promise.

73
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,630
Okay. Wait, what?

74
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:12,061
Hey, sweetheart,
can I help you carry your magazine?

75
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,072
Okay, no problem.

76
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:28,744
Oh, my God.

77
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,372
Hey, close your eyes.
Close your eyes, close your eyes.

78
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,874
Close your eyes, close your eyes.

79
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,377
Close your eyes. Open your mouth.

80
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,383
- It’s good?
- Yeah.

81
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,509
Yes? No? Yes?

82
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,887
Yes? I have reinvented the noodle,
l’m telling you.

83
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,348
Just try this one
because this one's really good.

84
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:52,309
It’s the same thing, but different. Fatter.

85
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,939
- Mmm.
- More of, you know... No?

86
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,858
- It’s good, right? Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

87
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:02,028
You know, I mean, modestly speaking,
I think l’m creating a masterpiece.

88
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:06,240
I don't know. I mean, there's one
that just came out perfect right now,

89
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,201
- which is... I think it's this one. I think it's...
- Victor?

90
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,078
- Try it. Even though it's dry, try it.
- Victor, Victor...

91
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:12,371
- Can I just say something?
- What?

92
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:14,790
We're leaving in 12 hours,
and you haven't packed for Verona.

93
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,083
- At all.
- Yeah, that's right, that's right.

94
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:18,210
- Yeah. I get too carried away.
- Do we clean this up?

95
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,712
No, no.

96
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,801
- It’s gonna be incredible.
- I know. L’m so excited.

97
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,426
Sophia!

98
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:10,596
Sophia! Wherefore art thou,
my sweet Sophia?

99
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,023
- I love this place. I love. Right?
- It’s amazing.

100
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,818
- I have to show you the most beautiful...
- You know what's even more amazing?

101
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,487
- What?
- I just got off the phone with Signor Morini,

102
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:30,282
and he's arranged a private tour for us
with each and every one of my suppliers.

103
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:34,703
We're starting off with the oldest and
most beautiful vineyard in all of Veneto.

104
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,497
Yeah?

105
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,040
Victor.

106
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,668
Sophie, come on. No, you're not getting it.

107
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,796
I mean, we're gonna go to the oldest,
the most beautiful vineyard around.

108
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,465
This is romantic. All right?

109
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,134
We're gonna go there,
we're gonna drink a little wine,

110
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,718
we're gonna get a little tipsy,

111
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,804
and we're gonna come back
and we're gonna...

112
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,307
I mean, how was it?

113
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,685
- I tried to talk to Bobby again.
- - How did it go?

114
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,311
It didn't go,
because I didn't talk to him.

115
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,563
- Why?
- - Because I was scared.

116
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:01,939
Really?

117
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,650
It's time for me to stop
checking facts and actually start writing.

118
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,945
Yeah, yeah, it's your passion.
You should do that.

119
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,033
It’s the grape that I told you about

120
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,077
- that they use for the region, Soave?
- Right, right, right.

121
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,495
- You know. You remember?
- Yeah.

122
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:27,882
Mmm. Mmm!

123
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,008
- Do you like?
- This is good.

124
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,509
- Wow.

125
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:32,595
It’s fresh flower and fruit. Do you feel it?

126
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,388
Yeah? You feel it? It's so good.

127
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,765
Smile.

128
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:41,770
Sophie.

129
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,027
Mmm! Mmm-hmm.

130
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,324
We have to get tickets to the opera
before they sell out.

131
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,867
- We need to see the Castelvecchio.
- Yeah, yeah.

132
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:55,951
We have to see Lake Garda

133
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,329
- and Juliet's house.
- Yeah, of course. Yeah.

134
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:08,339
Sophie, this is beautiful.
This is incredible. The smell...

135
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,269
Mmm!

136
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:27,691
Sophie, this is amazing! This is great!

137
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,737
I wish I was a little mouse
living in your cheese cave.

138
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:42,998
Hey, that was Signor Morini on the phone.

139
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,084
You know, he's inviting us
to this incredible forest,

140
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,919
that's just, like, 120 kilometers away.

141
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:50,839
- And they dig these exquisite truffles...
- Wait. 120 kilometers?

142
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:55,094
- Yeah, it's not like miles, Sophie.
- No, I understand the difference, but I just...

143
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:59,348
I just don't understand why you wanna go
120 kilometers to see a mushroom.

144
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:02,226
It's not a mushroom, okay?

145
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,105
It’s a truffle. It's a tartufo. It's the thing
that you put on top of pasta, you know?

146
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,564
- A tartufo?
- It’s something else. It's...

147
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,108
Come on,
you've been having a good day, right?

148
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,651
It was fine.

149
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,194
But now, I just...

150
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:16,198
To be honest, I don't really feel like going
to see a mushroom.

151
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:21,161
Okay, fine, I get it. I get it. It's fine. I get it.
I mean, just don't call it a mushroom, okay?

152
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,288
Yeah, okay.

153
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:25,332
You know what?
Why don't you go see the truffle place

154
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:28,377
- and l’ll go do my thing and sightsee?
- Really?

155
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,962
Yeah. Win-win.

156
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,798
"My dear Juliet..."

157
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,100
"Dear Juliet,
the man that I love is not my husband."

158
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,623
Are you okay?

159
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:52,748
Take this basket and... Come si dice?
Dig in.

160
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,333
Dig in?

161
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:57,336
You are the translator
from the employment office?

162
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,755
- No. No, I mean...
- I have been waiting two weeks.

163
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,717
L’m sorry. My name is Sophie.
I just... I followed you,

164
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:07,513
and I saw that you put the letters
into a basket,

165
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,765
and I just wondered why.

166
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,683
Why?

167
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,313
You are a writer?

168
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,275
Yeah, I am. I am a writer.

169
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,157
Come. I show you.

170
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,123
They come from all over the world
every day.

171
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,333
But taking their letters?

172
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:40,546
Is that not like taking pennies
from a wishing well?

173
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,090
How else can we give them answers?

174
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,719
Oh, my God. So, you write all of them back.

175
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,346
Yes.

176
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,141
- You're all Juliet?
- Her secretaries.

177
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,607
Donatella has been married 51 years
to the same man.

178
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,734
She handles husband problems.

179
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:06,863
Husbands are like wine.
They take a long time to mature.

180
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,785
Francesca is a nurse.
She deals with illness and loss.

181
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:13,704
And Maria...

182
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:16,081
Why do you always sigh
when you say my name?

183
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:21,003
She has 12 children, 29 grandchildren,
and 16 great-grandchildren.

184
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,797
- She writes whatever she likes.
- And you?

185
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,883
Isabella answers the ones
you can barely read.

186
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:32,306
Yeah, the lovers' quarrels,
the breakups, the really tangled hearts.

187
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,183
Someone has to do it.

188
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,938
My mother.
Would you like to stay for dinner, Sophie?

189
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:52,034
Mamma, this is not an insult.

190
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:59,374
I make a beautiful dish,
big enough for the whole town,

191
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,835
and she says no.

192
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,297
I would love to, but I do... I have to go.

193
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,008
This is the problem of the americani.

194
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:11,219
- Always running.
- Please, Mamma.

195
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,097
I have to meet my fiancé.

196
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:15,682
Fiancé?

197
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,904
At least take some dessert
for you and your fiancé.

198
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,093
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

199
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:54,012
You know, 120 kilometers each way
and l’m still beating you?

200
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:56,098
- Congratulations.
- What? Yeah. What?

201
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,684
I mean, how was Verona?
How was it without me?

202
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,228
Empty? Half-empty? Completely empty?

203
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,021
Half-empty.

204
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:06,024
- I met the Secretaries of Juliet.
- Juliet?

205
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,360
- Like Juliet Capulet?
- Yeah.

206
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:12,030
There are these women that call themselves
the Secretaries of Juliet,

207
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:14,700
and they write letters to people
that write letters to Juliet.

208
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,913
And then these secretaries,
they work for the city of Verona,

209
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,748
and, like, all these people,

210
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,625
these brokenhearted women
all over the world,

211
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,794
come and they write letters

212
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,255
- and leave them on the wall.
- What's in the bag?

213
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,798
I don't know.

214
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,175
So, they post these letters.

215
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,469
They post them on the wall
in Juliet's courtyard,

216
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,597
and then these secretaries come back
with this basket

217
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:40,434
and they retrieve the letters every day.

218
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,395
And then they write back, as Juliet,

219
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,230
to all the letters
that have return addresses on them.

220
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,273
Mmm-hmm.

221
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,734
This is their job.
I mean, it's so unbelievable.

222
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,902
This is their passion.
It’s what they do every day.

223
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,028
Mmm. Mmm.

224
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:54,406
- They literally will work all day, every day.
- Mmm! Oh, my God!

225
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,992
- And they've been doing it for years.
- Sophie. Wow. This is incredible!

226
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,452
And they...

227
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,412
This is incredible.

228
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,165
This is incredible. Oh, my God.

229
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:06,585
This is great. Try this, try this.
You have to try this. Oh, my God.

230
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:09,171
No... Give it a good bite. Come on.

231
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,093
Your Victor is very passionate.

232
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,095
Yes, yes, I know.

233
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,974
But he seems to think that he's Italian
since we got here.

234
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,852
And although imitation is, of course,
the highest form of flattery,

235
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,228
his imitations are not very good.

236
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,939
Okay, that woman is amazing.
I mean, she's incredible.

237
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,483
She's incredible. I think l’m in love.

238
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,443
- Absolutely.
- You're in love with her?

239
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,945
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Really?

240
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,072
Okay. Just say no.

241
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:40,952
Just say no, and I won't do it, really.
I mean, l’m dying to do it, but I won't.

242
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,412
Okay. What?

243
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,541
Angelina's offered
to teach me some secrets today.

244
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,168
- Okay.
- Yeah.

245
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,086
Okay, right now and all day?

246
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,714
Like, right now. That's crazy, right?
I mean, now. That's amazing.

247
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,550
I mean, she's making
risotto all'Amarone, right? Yeah?

248
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,511
- Good risotto.
- You see?

249
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,514
You see, it's, like, 300 years old
or something, her recipe. It's fantastic.

250
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:04,309
Okay. That's great. But...
So, no Lake Garda then today?

251
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,560
Oh, yeah. Lake Garda...

252
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,772
I mean, Lake Garda's been there
for, like, 500,000 years, you know.

253
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,066
And right now,
Angelina's offered to help me.

254
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,901
And, you know,
I mean, l’m here, we're here, you know.

255
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,945
- We're having a good time.
- You, Paul Newman,

256
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:18,156
you want to work, you have to watch!

257
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,577
You see? I mean, you see,
I became Paul Newman. All right?

258
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:25,455
Okay, what shall I do?
I mean, my hands are tied.

259
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,581
I don't know. I don't know.

260
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,583
You could help us if you like.

261
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,002
- Yeah! Yeah. The letter thing, right?
- Why not?

262
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:34,005
Yeah, yeah, you write the letters
and l’ll cook. And later we eat and...

263
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,340
Win-win.

264
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,218
How long have you
and Victor been engaged?

265
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,469
Almost a year.

266
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:43,306
Wow. And may I ask
why don't you wear an engagement ring?

267
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:46,560
Yeah, see, that's... That's me. I insisted.

268
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:50,480
He was so busy, you know,
this whole restaurant and everything.

269
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:53,108
And I guess I felt it unnecessary.

270
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,488
Still, a girl should have a ring.

271
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,829
"I didn't go to him, Juliet.

272
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,957
"I didn't go to Lorenzo.

273
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:54,169
"His eyes were so full of trust.

274
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:57,839
"I promised I'd meet him
to run away together

275
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:00,008
"because my parents don't approve.

276
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:04,596
"But instead, I left him waiting for me,
below our tree,

277
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:08,058
"waiting and wondering where I was.

278
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,769
"L’m in Verona now.

279
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:14,272
"I return to London in the morning,
and l’m so afraid.

280
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,526
"Please, Juliet, tell me what I should do.

281
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:23,365
"My heart is breaking,
and I have no one else to turn to.

282
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,408
"Love, Claire."

283
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,536
And it's been there for all those years?

284
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:34,626
I think she came back
to find her one true love.

285
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:39,506
And they had 10 children
and still make passionate love every night.

286
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:45,845
Except he got bald and fat
and she has to do all the work.

287
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,305
- Francesca.
- Francesca.

288
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:51,643
And maybe she stayed in London
and married a duke

289
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,604
and lived happily ever after, just like me.

290
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:58,733
- But you married an accountant, not a duke.
- Nobody's perfect.

291
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,903
And I bet when she's making love
to that duke...

292
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:05,240
- Yeah?
...she's imagining her first love, Lorenzo.

293
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:11,079
Isabella, I have to write back.

294
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,171
Then answer her.

295
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:48,950
Good night, friends.

296
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:15,810
Good night.

297
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,369
Hey.

298
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,830
Hey.

299
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:19,833
- Sorry l’m late.
- No, it's fine. No worries.

300
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,626
- How was your day? Good?
- It was...

301
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,002
- It was so good.
- Yeah?

302
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:24,712
- Yeah.
- Good. L’m glad.

303
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:25,922
How was Angelina?

304
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:29,634
Yeah, it was good. I mean, she's amazing,
you know. That woman is incredible.

305
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,762
She's very instinctive, you know.
She cooks without recipes.

306
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:33,888
I mean, she's incredible.

307
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,682
- She's invited me to cook again.
- Really?

308
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,976
Yeah. Yeah,
I think I can learn a lot from her.

309
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,435
But...

310
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,147
No, no, you first, you first. Sorry, sorry.

311
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:45,150
- No, just real quick. I just...
- Mmm-hmm?

312
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:47,277
I had the most amazing day.

313
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:50,488
I got to answer a letter
that was written 50 years ago.

314
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:54,909
I know it might not get there,
but it just feels so good to write.

315
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,121
Yeah, I think you should spend more time
with them.

316
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:01,249
- Why?
- Because it's your passion, right?

317
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:04,169
And also because it fits perfectly.

318
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:06,921
Because I just got off the phone
with Signor Morini,

319
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:10,758
and he's invited me to this amazing
wine auction that's happening in Livorno.

320
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,052
- In Livorno?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

321
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:14,637
It’s super-exclusive.

322
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:18,183
I mean, I don't know...
I don't know if I can get a ticket, you know.

323
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:22,937
I mean, l’ll be off, like, a day or two, max.
If you want, l’ll try to get two tickets,

324
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,273
- but l’m not sure I can get two tickets.
- Yeah.

325
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,193
To a wine auction? In Livorno?

326
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,653
Yeah, it sounds terrible. I know.

327
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:35,074
L’m sorry. L’m so... I feel terrible now.
I feel terrible. I mean, it's...

328
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,744
I miss you already, you know.

329
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,666
- I'll be back very soon. Okay?
- Yeah. Be careful.

330
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:50,715
Bye! Ciao.

331
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,663
Listen to
what this poor girl writes.

332
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:25,083
"Juliet, is there anything worse
in this world than a man?"

333
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,047
Excuse me.

334
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:37,178
L’m sorry to interrupt,
but are you the Secretaries of Juliet?

335
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,639
- Yes, that's us.
- Great.

336
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:44,269
May I ask, which one of you wrote this letter
to my grandmother, Claire Smith?

337
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:48,523
I wrote that.
And I can't believe that it found you.

338
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,693
Yes. We Brits tend to stay
in our family homes.

339
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:55,947
Yeah. This is amazing.
It’s less than a week since I mailed it.

340
00:26:56,991 --> 00:26:59,617
It was a very thoughtful letter.

341
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,996
Now, what were you thinking?

342
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,293
I was thinking that she deserved an answer.

343
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:10,461
Yeah, 50 years ago, maybe. Not now.

344
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:13,673
L’m sorry. I didn't know true love
had an expiration date.

345
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,676
True love? Are you joking?

346
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,512
Could you imagine what would've happened
if she hadn't seen sense?

347
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,806
Well, yeah, you wouldn't be here,
and that would be an upside.

348
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,349
What are you doing here anyway?

349
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:26,853
What, are you some lonely American girl
who has to live vicariously through others?

350
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:28,896
L’m not lonely. I am engaged.

351
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,317
My condolences to the groom.

352
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,995
Excuse me!

353
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,415
So that's it? You've come all the way
from London to give me a lecture?

354
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,335
No, I came because I couldn't let
my grandmother come on her own.

355
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:52,879
Claire is here? Why?

356
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:55,673
I think even you might be able
to work that one out.

357
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:58,926
Oh, my God!

358
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:02,472
That's awesome!
She's come to find her Lorenzo!

359
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:05,016
Awesome?

360
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:11,689
And if Lorenzo doesn't want to see her,
has forgotten her,

361
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:16,611
is gravely ill or dead,
let's say, just for fun, then what?

362
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:20,656
Thought so.

363
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,409
I want to meet her. L’d like to meet Claire.

364
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:25,912
And I want to play for Manchester United,
but l’m shit at football.

365
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,455
You don't think that she wants to meet me?

366
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,375
I honestly think
she has no interest meeting a woman

367
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:35,171
that can manage to jam, "Oh, my God"
and "awesome" into the same sentence.

368
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:12,333
Gran, they're closing up.
We should go now.

369
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:32,103
Excuse me. Claire? Hi. Hi.
My name is Sophie,

370
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,939
and I wrote you the letter.

371
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:38,401
Letter? From Juliet?

372
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,529
Goodness! Thank you.

373
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,491
Thank you. But however did you find us?

374
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:47,952
- Well, your grandson found me, actually.
- You did?

375
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,495
Right, well, the thing is,

376
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,706
- I thought we should...
- Yeah, well, he's very sweet

377
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:57,336
and very charming, and he thought
that you might like to meet me.

378
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,339
Uncharacteristically thoughtful of you, dear.

379
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:02,633
Yes, well, under the circumstances,

380
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:05,887
it seems a little churlish not
to meet the woman responsible

381
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:08,139
- for this voyage of lunacy.
- Okay.

382
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:11,350
Charlie doesn't approve,
which makes this all the more fun.

383
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:16,314
We were just going for a glass of wine.
Would you like to join us?

384
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:17,482
Absolutely not.

385
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:18,566
- What?
- Absolutely not.

386
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,444
It’s been a long day. It's too long a day.

387
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,946
- Okay, darling. Have a good sleep.
- But I...

388
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:26,449
Do you know somewhere we could go?

389
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,202
I actually have the perfect place.

390
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,666
I can't believe you're really here.

391
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:40,630
I was taking an art course in Tuscany,
staying with a family outside Siena,

392
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:46,594
and they had a son Lorenzo,
and it was love at first sight.

393
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,931
He had such gentle blue eyes.

394
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,808
And he told me I was very beautiful.

395
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:06,030
And he gave me this ring.

396
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,700
We wanted to get married,

397
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:13,996
but l’d got exams back in England
and my parents would never have agreed,

398
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:15,957
and I got scared,

399
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:18,459
and I ran away.

400
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:21,879
Now

401
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,468
what I really want is to

402
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:32,974
tell him that l’m so sorry
I was such a coward.

403
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:36,769
Of course, a card or letter is just too simple.

404
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:39,855
So, you've come to find your Lorenzo?

405
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,900
Yes, and I think I know where he is.

406
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:44,485
Where?

407
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,821
On the farm, just near Siena.

408
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,866
Charlie's driving me down tomorrow.

409
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:53,578
Only because I didn't want you to hitchhike.

410
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,206
Well, he thinks it's a big mistake.

411
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:59,834
Because you don't have a romantic bone
in your body.

412
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,712
No, no. It's because I am a realist.

413
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:05,131
No. Because you are an Englishman!

414
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:06,674
Cold as fish!

415
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:10,595
Right. And who was it
that wrote Romeo and Juliet?

416
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:13,472
Williamo Shakespearelli, a great Italian.

417
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,892
They're mad. They're mad.

418
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,854
Sophie, my dear.

419
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:23,482
Good night. Thank you so much.

420
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,526
Thank you.

421
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:31,032
Good night. Good night, everybody.

422
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,868
- Good night.
- Charlie, let's go.

423
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,786
- Good night, ladies. Ciao.
- Good luck.

424
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:36,871
- Bye.
- Ciao.

425
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,790
How wonderful would it be
if she found her Romeo?

426
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:47,256
Imagine if she did, 50 years later,
all because you found that letter.

427
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:51,093
Nobody would believe it
if it weren't true, you know.

428
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,021
Wait! Wait!

429
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,607
- Oh, for... Here she comes.
- Sorry.

430
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:08,736
- May I come with you to find Lorenzo?
- Come with us?

431
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:10,946
What about this fiancé of yours?

432
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:13,324
You're in the city of love
and you want to come with us?

433
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:17,036
Yes, I do. Because he's busy and l’m free.
And I mean...

434
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,830
- Of course, if it's not an intrusion.
- No, no, it's not an intrusion.

435
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,040
I just... Listen,

436
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,000
- I do have one thing to tell you first.
- It’s not an intrusion.

437
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:24,752
This is not entirely selfless.

438
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,630
It started out as a simple reply
to your letter,

439
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:31,092
and now I think it's so amazing
what you're doing,

440
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:34,762
- and l’d love to write about it if it's okay.
- A journalist.

441
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,807
Gran, a journalist
trying to pry into our private lives.

442
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:40,685
Charlie, come on.
It’s hardly state secrets, is it?

443
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,604
L’m not a journalist.
I would like to be some day, but...

444
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,940
And you think Gran's story is your ticket?

445
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,775
I think it's a story worth telling.

446
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,360
L’d love to have you with us.

447
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,946
- Really?
- Yes. Of course.

448
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:53,447
We would.

449
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,497
How much time
did you actually spend with Lorenzo?

450
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:45,833
Every second that we could.

451
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:50,671
L’d go to meet him after class,
to the farm where he was working,

452
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:55,801
and we'd sit under the trees and we'd share
some bread with tomatoes and olive oil.

453
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:57,470
- It’s so romantic.
- Yeah.

454
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,263
What's so romantic about eating in the dirt?

455
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,347
Really?

456
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:03,392
The dirt.
Well, you see, he loved the earth.

457
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:07,897
He loved talking to me about the rain

458
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,525
and the springs of fresh water,

459
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:14,653
and we'd walk for miles and miles.

460
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:17,114
We'd lie in the dry grass.

461
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,450
I can still remember

462
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:24,538
the smell of his sweet, hot sweat and...

463
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:27,833
Okay. Okay, Gran. We get the picture.

464
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:33,130
So you must feel like you're about
to find your long-lost soul mate.

465
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:34,340
Yes.

466
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:37,760
Her soul mate was my grandfather.
Let's not invalidate my entire existence.

467
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:41,680
Okay, l’m sorry, I just...
That's clearly not what I meant.

468
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,767
Charlie's just like my husband.

469
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:47,269
Both skeptics.

470
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:51,273
My husband always insisted
that love was nothing but hormones.

471
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:55,152
But you see, underneath,
he had such a warm, passionate heart.

472
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,822
And Charlie's just the same.

473
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,829
Tell me about the guy you're in love with.

474
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,332
Victor.

475
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:10,334
Yeah.

476
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:21,178
- Well, Victor is a chef, an amazing chef.
- Wow.

477
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:25,015
Yeah. He's opening his own restaurant
in New York.

478
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:30,521
And that's the reason we're here.
We're meeting suppliers all around.

479
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:35,568
And he's actually... He's in Livorno
at a wine auction as we speak.

480
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:38,696
That sounds fun.

481
00:36:39,573 --> 00:36:41,574
For him. Yeah.

482
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:48,289
Well, and do your parents like him?

483
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:54,253
Yeah, my dad. My dad likes him.

484
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:58,591
My mom left us when I was nine.

485
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,302
Oh, dear.

486
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,891
- Oh, dear. L’m sorry about that.
- That's okay. It was a really long time ago.

487
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:20,571
Slowly, slowly.

488
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:48,015
How do you want to go about this?

489
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,810
Ring the doorbell.

490
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:06,533
What if the wife answers
and goes into a fit of jealous rage? Gran?

491
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:11,205
Well, l’d be flattered.

492
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:20,214
L’m more worried that
he won't remember me.

493
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,551
Right. Let's go home then, Gran,
before this all ends in tears.

494
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,477
Come on. There's no one in.

495
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,187
L’m gonna check the back.

496
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,730
There's no... We made our best effort.

497
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,233
There's no need to prolong
the disappointment.

498
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:54,957
It’s me, yeah.

499
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,168
Good afternoon. L’m Charlie Wyman.

500
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:00,754
This is my grandmother, Claire,

501
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,172
- and Sophie.
- Ciao.

502
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,552
L’m Claire. Do you remember?

503
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:09,346
Claire.

504
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,352
It’s not him.

505
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,272
Are you sure?

506
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,441
It’s not his eyes.

507
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:27,948
Let's make sure.

508
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:31,660
Do you remember what you were doing
in the summer of 1957?

509
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:36,790
The summer of 1957, I will never forget,

510
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:41,378
I met the most beautiful girl
with long, blonde hair.

511
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:42,546
Nana!

512
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,465
We married that year.

513
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:49,678
- I curse that woman!
- What?

514
00:39:49,763 --> 00:39:50,804
- Oh, no!
- Right.

515
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:54,516
I curse her eyes! I curse her teeth!
I curse her mustache!

516
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:59,980
But why are you asking?
Why you bring up such a horrible memory?

517
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,775
Well, that went well.

518
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:05,235
Can't say we didn't try, Nana.
L’m sorry. Truly.

519
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,445
Are you for real?

520
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:10,157
If I actually knew what that question meant,
I might attempt to answer it.

521
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,160
He can't be the only Lorenzo Bartolini
in Tuscany.

522
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,955
Well, he's the only one around here, so...

523
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,417
I haven't flown all the way here
to pack it in now.

524
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:21,835
Nana, what do you want to do?

525
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,131
You want to start knocking on every door
asking if Lorenzo's in? I mean...

526
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,384
How many can there be?

527
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:32,096
Seventy-four?

528
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:36,391
Seventy-four Lorenzo Bartolinis
and you want to go on a scavenger hunt?

529
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:37,976
Lmpossible.
We're going home in the morning.

530
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:41,605
Come on, Charlie, will you calm down?
Sophie, what do you think?

531
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,775
Gran, what do you mean,
what does she think? She doesn't think.

532
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:48,821
This was her brilliant idea. It's over! Done!
We found Nemo.

533
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:50,447
The curtains have closed.

534
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:55,285
- Sophie.
- Listen, this is my job.

535
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:59,206
I find things.
And through process of elimination

536
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:03,043
and caveat emptor, which will require
assembling a few more facts,

537
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,295
we can narrow this down considerably.

538
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,382
Did Ms. Awesome For Real
just use caveat emptor?

539
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:12,553
Oh, please, all right. I went to Brown.
Double Major. Minor in Latin.

540
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,555
This is madness. It's madness.

541
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,809
Charlie, didn't you say
you wanted to go and swim?

542
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:22,104
- We are working. Go away.
- This is utter, complete mad...

543
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,313
Work!

544
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:26,316
I can't believe it.

545
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:28,235
Ridiculous.

546
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,284
He's a good-looking sort.

547
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:37,619
Isn't he?

548
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:47,254
All right. Are you sure that
Lorenzo would never have left this area?

549
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:51,592
He loved this land. L’m quite certain.

550
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,388
May I?

551
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:12,112
Our Lorenzos.

552
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,664
Are you sure that you have time for all this?

553
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,260
Ciao. How are you?

554
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,888
L’m good. How are you?

555
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,307
You know what?
I was just witnessing this most incredible,

556
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,808
incredible Sauterne auction.

557
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:44,269
It was just beautiful. It was incredible.
How's it going?

558
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,772
L’m good. L’m in Siena right now.

559
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:48,315
What? In Siena?

560
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,901
- What are you doing in Siena?
- L’m writing a story.

561
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,111
We're kind of on a bit of an adventure,

562
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:56,531
looking for somebody that
she used to know 50 years ago.

563
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:57,783
You know what, baby? You know what?

564
00:42:57,867 --> 00:43:00,494
I mean, this isn't a good time because
l’m in the middle of something,

565
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,830
but, I mean, l’m glad you called because
I was actually just gonna call you right now.

566
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:07,960
You know, the opportunities here are really,
really, really incredible, you know,

567
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:10,462
and I think
l’m gonna have to stay till Friday.

568
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:13,090
Can I stay or should I skip it?
I mean, I feel horrible, but...

569
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:16,301
No, do it. Please.
L’m gonna need until Friday, as well.

570
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:20,013
Great. So Friday, all right? Friday.
Friday's good. Okay. Win-win.

571
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:27,938
Claire?

572
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:30,065
L’m free.

573
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,776
- Free for what? Free for what?
- She's coming.

574
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,778
- She's coming with us.
- She's coming? Splendid.

575
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,780
That's splendid! Fantastic!

576
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,611
- Okay?
- Okay.

577
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:26,204
Good luck.

578
00:44:58,154 --> 00:44:59,654
It’s not him.

579
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:01,531
Oh, my God. No!

580
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:33,980
Well, wouldn't this be nice, Gran?

581
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:37,484
Going from a boy who works the fields
to a man who owns them.

582
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,070
And you got to skip the messy bits.

583
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,908
Life is the messy bits.

584
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:54,251
Peccato it wasn't me.

585
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:56,920
Yes.

586
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:01,675
I would have never let you go.

587
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,553
Believe me.

588
00:46:15,565 --> 00:46:18,859
What is it with you and Italian men?
They fall at your feet.

589
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:22,279
It’s such a shame.
I think I could've been happy here.

590
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:24,948
Happy? Did your grandson just say happy?

591
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:26,783
I said could have been.

592
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:29,411
Let's not get carried away.
I have a reputation to uphold.

593
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:37,085
Charlie, why don't you tell Sophie
about your pro bono legal work?

594
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:39,463
I can't imagine
she'd have much interest, Gran.

595
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,048
- Try me.
- You know the sort of thing,

596
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:46,761
defending the defenseless, preserving
human rights, helping refugees get asylum.

597
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,473
- You look surprised.
- L’m so surprised.

598
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:53,393
I just didn't have you pinned down
as the save-humanity type at all.

599
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:56,229
Really?

600
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:01,610
And what type did you have me
pinned down for exactly?

601
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:04,863
Well, I was leaning towards
elitist Oxford prig,

602
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:08,700
but now that you mention it,
self-satisfied do-gooder works, as well.

603
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,911
I guess you're a poor judge
of character then.

604
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:13,622
But she does deal with facts, Charlie.

605
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:17,000
Okay.

606
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:19,586
- L’m off to bed.
- Okay.

607
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:22,714
- Good night, darling.
- Good night. Sleep well.

608
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:25,383
- May I walk you to your room?
- Be nice to each other.

609
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,390
She is awesome.

610
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:35,477
I respect your usage of the word
this one instance.

611
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,854
Oh, l’m flattered. Thank you for approving.

612
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:39,689
You're very welcome.

613
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:45,612
Right. Well. Should we hit the sack?

614
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:47,781
Sorry. I guess I...

615
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:55,247
Well, as much as l’d love to sit here
and drink the whole bottle of Caparzo...

616
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:58,667
No, go to bed. You should.
Good night, Charlie.

617
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:01,253
Right.

618
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:03,755
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

619
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:16,017
Forgive me. Where are my manners?

620
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:18,853
You know, l’ve been wondering that
since I met you.

621
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:21,314
Yes, well, I don't know what it is,

622
00:48:21,983 --> 00:48:24,401
but you seem to bring out
the very worst in me.

623
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:27,404
- Somehow it's my fault.
- All of this is your fault.

624
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:29,739
You wrote that blasted letter.

625
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,578
Nonetheless, may I walk you to your room?

626
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:38,039
You know, l’m not the buttoned-up,

627
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:40,625
buttock-clenching killjoy
you try to make me out as.

628
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:44,796
Right. And I made you argue that
true love is bollocks.

629
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:47,424
Guilty.

630
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:53,471
It’s just that l’m genuinely worried for her.

631
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:56,600
I know she may seem carefree,

632
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:01,021
but her life hasn't been all that simple.

633
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,275
Is it that unreasonable for me to worry?

634
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:09,321
No, but I have a really good feeling
about this. You'll see.

635
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,698
Let's hope you're right.

636
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,264
Signora Claire.

637
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,019
Signor Bartolini.

638
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,169
We're not done yet.

639
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:51,840
Of course we're not, darling.

640
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:23,079
Hello.

641
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:24,998
- Hello?
- Hello.

642
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:30,670
Hi. Is Claire with you? No?

643
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,381
No, no. She's turned in early, actually.

644
00:51:33,466 --> 00:51:34,674
Okay.

645
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:36,634
I was gonna ask if you wanted dinner, but...

646
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:39,345
I just... I wanted to get started on my story.

647
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:41,139
How's it coming?

648
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:43,141
It’s coming okay.

649
00:51:44,185 --> 00:51:45,560
Am I in it?

650
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,979
- You may be. Why?
- Can I read just a little bit?

651
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:50,315
- Are you kidding me?
- Come on, just a little bit.

652
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,941
Absolutely not.

653
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:55,570
How am I to be sure that
l’m being properly portrayed?

654
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:57,947
No, you are. Believe me. You are.

655
00:51:58,032 --> 00:52:00,992
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means good night, Charlie.

656
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:05,622
- Good night.
- Okay.

657
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:07,874
Yeah.

658
00:52:11,337 --> 00:52:12,670
Good night.

659
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:18,384
- What? Okay.
- Is this

660
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,806
one of those situations
where you're really saying the opposite

661
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:24,974
of what you actually mean?

662
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:26,726
No.

663
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:28,228
Right.

664
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:30,355
Good night then.

665
00:52:30,439 --> 00:52:32,148
Good night, Charlie.

666
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:52,335
Good morning.

667
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,170
Gran wants to sleep in this morning.

668
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:56,673
Is she okay?
I mean, does she need anything?

669
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:59,926
No need.
She's tough as old boots, that one.

670
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:02,053
Churchill in a dress.

671
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:07,684
So, I thought l’d see a bit of Siena
since we're here.

672
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:09,394
It’s a good idea.

673
00:53:10,563 --> 00:53:13,231
I suppose you want to keep on writing.

674
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:15,775
I mean...

675
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,361
Work, work, work.

676
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:20,405
Admirable trait.

677
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:26,119
Right, of course. Carry on then.

678
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:30,123
Charlie?

679
00:53:33,002 --> 00:53:34,794
Since we're here...

680
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:41,467
I hate to compliment you, but what
you're doing for Claire is really...

681
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:43,761
It’s sweet, and I...

682
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:48,141
I imagine that you'd rather be spending
your holiday elsewhere,

683
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:52,937
so did you volunteer your services, or did
your parents? I mean, where do they fit in?

684
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:58,443
L’d like to think they're someplace nice.

685
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:04,699
They were killed in a car accident
when I was 10.

686
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,704
L’m sorry.

687
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:13,082
God, l’m sorry.

688
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:17,086
Thank you, Sophie. I appreciate it.

689
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:20,089
It was a difficult time.

690
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:23,134
Gran lost her son.

691
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:25,637
I lost my parents.

692
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:30,642
L’m not a big believer in happy endings,
l’m afraid.

693
00:54:31,852 --> 00:54:36,898
Anyway, Gran stepped in. Took an angry,
obnoxious, young boy under her wing

694
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:40,652
and made me the simply unpleasant man
I am today.

695
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:46,908
So, isn't your fiancé
starting to get just a tad lonely?

696
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:50,119
You know, Victor's having
the time of his life right now.

697
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:52,956
And I doubt he even notices that l’m gone.

698
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,582
What about you?

699
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,379
- Don't you have a girlfriend?
- That is a very, very long story.

700
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,214
Yeah? L’m not surprised.

701
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,716
It’s been about a year
since l’ve seen Patricia.

702
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:05,802
And you broke up with her?

703
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:12,183
Are you insinuating that l’m more the type
to be dumped rather than do the dumping?

704
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,309
Maybe I am.

705
00:55:13,394 --> 00:55:16,312
Actually, I did break up with Patricia.
This time.

706
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,448
Okay, that's enough.

707
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:34,414
All right. That's enough.

708
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,334
- Sophie...
- That's enough.

709
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:41,713
- Your writing is really good.
- Thank you.

710
00:55:41,797 --> 00:55:44,424
No. It's really, really, really good.

711
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,802
Why are you so surprised?

712
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:50,471
How come you've never shown
your work to anyone?

713
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:52,807
- I never feel like it's finished.
- Why?

714
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:55,435
Because I guess l’m a perfectionist.

715
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:59,105
You know that's just another way
of saying "l’m a chicken"?

716
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:02,108
Listen. You've got nothing to be afraid of.

717
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:05,278
You're not a fact checker. You're a writer.

718
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:10,283
- What was that for?
- L’m not a chicken.

719
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,328
- And l’m not a gentleman.

720
00:56:15,748 --> 00:56:17,790
Do you think we should get back to Claire?

721
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:20,001
Yeah. Many more Lorenzos.

722
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:22,962
Okay.

723
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:29,177
We should get back to Claire.

724
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:33,848
I am Lorenzo Bartolini!

725
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,023
Take him! Take him!

726
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:46,986
I am Lorenzo Bartolini!

727
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:48,404
Wow.

728
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,616
I am Lorenzo Bartolini!

729
00:56:57,998 --> 00:56:59,624
Do you know what you are?

730
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:01,834
You are the Montagues and the Capulets.

731
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:07,090
You mean... Well, at least l’m not Romeo.

732
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:11,094
- That's the understatement of the century.
- No, no, no, because you see,

733
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:15,515
if I found the love of my life,
I wouldn't stand there like an idiot

734
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,600
whispering in a garden.

735
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:22,355
I would just grab her from that
blasted balcony and be done with it.

736
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:28,361
Do you believe in destiny?

737
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:30,696
Do you?

738
00:57:31,532 --> 00:57:33,116
Yeah, I think so.

739
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,536
I think it's destiny that l’m here, right now.

740
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:43,334
With Claire.

741
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:46,921
Of course. Of course. With Claire.

742
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:22,415
Well, this is the street.

743
00:58:26,295 --> 00:58:28,921
Well, there's 2. Here's number 2.

744
00:59:46,667 --> 00:59:48,084
This is what I feared the most.

745
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:51,963
- Charlie, we don't even know if it's him.
- I hope it's not. I hope it's not.

746
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,633
- Either way, we're finished. We're done.
- No. Not here.

747
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,843
When do we stop?

748
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:01,055
Over the next hill? Or the next?
Scour the whole country?

749
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:02,765
No. No. It ends here.

750
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:05,935
There are other Lorenzos
not too far away from here.

751
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:08,604
It’s not the ending you want, is it?

752
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:10,773
This isn't just a clever story

753
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:12,275
- with a clever ending.
- Stop it, Charlie.

754
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:14,151
- It’s our life. It's my Gran's life.
- It’s not about...

755
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:15,695
Charlie, it's not about a story.

756
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:18,281
No, no, no, she's already lost the man once.

757
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:22,493
How many more times
would you have her lose him?

758
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:25,288
You know what?
I don't expect you to understand any of this

759
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:28,374
because you don't know a thing
about real loss.

760
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:30,751
Yeah.

761
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:45,850
You're wrong.

762
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:52,523
Sophie's mother ran away from her
when she was a little girl.

763
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:59,030
It’s different, Gran. It's different.

764
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,578
You're right.

765
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:08,164
But

766
01:01:12,044 --> 01:01:14,712
Sophie's mother chose to leave her.

767
01:01:15,714 --> 01:01:18,549
And you always knew your mum and dad
loved you.

768
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:40,780
Come in.

769
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:46,452
Hi.

770
01:01:58,090 --> 01:01:59,423
Oh, dear.

771
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:07,348
I just wanted to see if you were all right.

772
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:08,641
L’m okay.

773
01:02:16,775 --> 01:02:19,235
Claire, l’m so sorry if I caused you...

774
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:20,403
No.

775
01:02:20,821 --> 01:02:23,614
Every minute has been so special.

776
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,121
Darling.

777
01:02:52,978 --> 01:02:54,186
May I?

778
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:08,284
One of the great joys in life
is having one's hair brushed.

779
01:03:24,676 --> 01:03:26,719
Charlie, say you're sorry.

780
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:32,558
In the eye, Charlie. With contrition.

781
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,233
Sophie...

782
01:03:41,902 --> 01:03:42,985
- Thank you.
...l’m afraid I...

783
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:44,487
In the eye.

784
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,198
Yes, Gran, l’m not 12.

785
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:50,409
Prove it.

786
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:02,463
L’m sincerely sorry, Sophie.

787
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,802
It won't happen again.

788
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:11,096
Excellent.

789
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:15,351
Sophie,

790
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,354
- I want to make a toast.
- Thank you.

791
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:24,109
I want to thank you for the wonderful thing
you did for a complete stranger.

792
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:26,028
I'll never forget it.

793
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:27,530
Nor I.

794
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:31,825
L’ve had the most incredible few days.
I really have,

795
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:34,954
and I can't thank you enough
for letting me tag along.

796
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:37,915
I think you did more than tag along.

797
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:42,753
Here is to all our loved ones,
wherever they may be.

798
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:04,066
May I join you?

799
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:05,401
Please.

800
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:17,871
I am sorry, Sophie.

801
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:29,425
I used to lay out under the stars as a kid,
in the summertime.

802
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:35,639
"Doubt thou the stars are fire

803
01:05:36,141 --> 01:05:38,350
"Doubt that the sun doth move"

804
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:41,812
"Doubt truth be a liar

805
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:44,815
"But never doubt I love"

806
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:55,075
Do you think he's out there? Lorenzo?

807
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:56,535
Yeah.

808
01:05:58,330 --> 01:05:59,872
He's somewhere.

809
01:06:02,584 --> 01:06:05,085
And am I wrong? To insist she quit?

810
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:08,047
No, you know,

811
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,884
you can't go on forever.

812
01:06:12,344 --> 01:06:14,637
At some point, you have to stop.

813
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:20,184
Then why is it that
I feel like a schoolboy on Sunday?

814
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:26,398
It’s nearly tomorrow and I don't want to go.

815
01:06:28,652 --> 01:06:30,069
Me, either.

816
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:33,822
And I always liked school.

817
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:43,934
- Morning.
- Morning.

818
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:45,352
Thank you.

819
01:07:45,437 --> 01:07:46,729
How'd you sleep?

820
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:48,814
I slept fine. How about you?

821
01:07:49,274 --> 01:07:51,483
Yes. Great. Thanks.

822
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:58,449
- Good morning.
- - Good morning.

823
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:01,326
- How are you?
- Good morning, my darling.

824
01:08:02,162 --> 01:08:03,996
It’s a beautiful day.

825
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:13,505
Sophie, would you mind going in the front?
Because l’d love to stretch my legs for a bit.

826
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:17,134
Okay.

827
01:08:19,763 --> 01:08:21,472
Fantastic, darling.

828
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:27,728
The stars were spectacular
from my window.

829
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:50,542
Look. That vineyard.
That's our favorite wine.

830
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:54,922
Let's turn in there
and have a goodbye toast.

831
01:08:55,006 --> 01:08:56,089
Okay.

832
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:19,988
Charlie, stop!

833
01:09:35,922 --> 01:09:37,589
Nana, what is it?

834
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:41,885
It’s Lorenzo.

835
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:45,222
Who?

836
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:48,600
The boy?

837
01:09:52,063 --> 01:09:55,649
All right, Nana. Let's get you in the shade.
Shall we?

838
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:09,288
I am Lorenzo Bartolini.

839
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:15,460
Sophie. I think this is...

840
01:10:15,837 --> 01:10:18,547
- Do you know a Lorenzo Bartolini?
- I asked him and...

841
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:21,049
- I am Lorenzo Bartolini.
- You are!

842
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:24,553
Oh, my... Sophie, he's the grandson!

843
01:10:26,848 --> 01:10:28,056
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

844
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:30,684
We're looking for a Lorenzo Bartolini.

845
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:31,935
I am Lorenzo Bartolini.

846
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:35,230
- He's Lorenzo, too.
- Do you have a father also named Lorenzo?

847
01:10:35,315 --> 01:10:37,983
Yes, he went out riding.
But what can I do for you?

848
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:41,528
L’m sorry. We're being terribly rude.

849
01:10:41,613 --> 01:10:43,405
- L’m Charlie Wyman.
- L’m Sophie.

850
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:44,865
Lorenzo. Lorenzo.

851
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:47,910
We have been on quite a journey
for your father.

852
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:50,579
You see,
my grandmother, Claire, knows him.

853
01:10:50,955 --> 01:10:52,664
Charlie. Charlie, let's go!

854
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:55,375
Let's go!

855
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:57,836
All right.

856
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:05,093
Nana, Nana, Nana, Lorenzo is here.

857
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:08,263
He's out riding,
but he's going to be back any minute.

858
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:12,726
Well, then, let's go before he comes back.

859
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:15,020
Nana, we've come all this way.

860
01:11:15,647 --> 01:11:17,773
- Come on.
- L’ve been ridiculous.

861
01:11:17,857 --> 01:11:20,108
L’ve been completely ridiculous.

862
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:24,529
He knew me when I was 15 years old, a girl.

863
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:27,824
That girl's gone.

864
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:36,124
Oh, my God.

865
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:41,481
Claire?

866
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:46,486
Yes.

867
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:55,287
So many years.

868
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:57,622
Yes, 50.

869
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:53,887
If you allow me.

870
01:13:55,807 --> 01:13:58,642
I really don't know how to express myself.

871
01:14:00,478 --> 01:14:04,439
Well, I went for a ride this morning
as an old man,

872
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:07,901
and I came back as a teenager again.

873
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:12,072
L’m so very happy you all meet Claire

874
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:14,991
and her grandson, Charlie,

875
01:14:15,827 --> 01:14:18,161
and their lovely friend, Sophie.

876
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:23,708
My dear Claire,

877
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:28,547
you have told me you lost your Jack.

878
01:14:29,924 --> 01:14:32,551
- And you know I lost my Rosa.
- Yeah.

879
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:36,388
But destiny wanted us to meet again.

880
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:45,105
Health to the Bartolini family.

881
01:14:46,566 --> 01:14:47,732
To the Bartolinis.

882
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:57,576
L’m sorry I was late.

883
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:00,287
No.

884
01:15:02,957 --> 01:15:06,334
When we are speaking about love,
it's never too late.

885
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:27,105
Well, bad luck, eh?

886
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:32,360
All hope lost and he rides in
at the last moment on a white horse.

887
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:34,946
No one will believe it.

888
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:37,490
Promise me...

889
01:15:38,618 --> 01:15:41,119
Promise me you'll finish the story.

890
01:15:48,753 --> 01:15:50,462
I guess this is it.

891
01:15:53,633 --> 01:15:55,425
And l’m sorry it is.

892
01:15:57,511 --> 01:15:58,970
Yeah, me, too.

893
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,394
Sophie, I...

894
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:14,736
I never should've kissed you.
I was completely out of bounds.

895
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:17,322
Mmm.

896
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:21,159
You're engaged and...

897
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:38,885
It’s time to go.

898
01:16:45,226 --> 01:16:46,851
Goodbye, Charlie.

899
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:50,438
I'll miss you.

900
01:16:57,989 --> 01:17:00,573
Hi. It is time to...

901
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:04,536
I must get back to Victor. Sorry.

902
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:07,414
Yes. Of course.

903
01:17:07,498 --> 01:17:10,500
So, where's Charlie?
We'll give you a drive there straight away.

904
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:11,918
No, l’m...

905
01:17:12,586 --> 01:17:14,963
Claire, I can't take you away
from this place, so...

906
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:16,840
My son can drive you.

907
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:20,844
- Just a moment.
- Yes. Grazie.

908
01:17:29,562 --> 01:17:31,354
L’m so happy for you.

909
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:37,068
Is something wrong?

910
01:17:37,153 --> 01:17:38,361
No! No.

911
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:41,781
No. It's just, you know...

912
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:46,328
And you're leaving?

913
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:49,706
An angel brought you to me.

914
01:17:51,542 --> 01:17:52,876
Thank you.

915
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:57,589
Thank you. L’ll be eternally grateful.

916
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:03,428
Thank you.

917
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:17,067
It’s very kind. Thank you.

918
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:19,986
Thank you so much.

919
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:24,449
- You're always welcome here.
- Thank you.

920
01:18:25,326 --> 01:18:27,243
- Thank you, Lorenzo.
- Ciao.

921
01:18:27,328 --> 01:18:28,870
Speak soon.

922
01:18:31,582 --> 01:18:32,624
Bye.

923
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:02,821
Darling, you're family,

924
01:19:02,905 --> 01:19:07,909
so I think you'll understand
why l’m telling you you're a total idiot.

925
01:19:08,869 --> 01:19:11,579
Okay, okay, then don't sugarcoat it, Gran.

926
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:12,914
I won't.

927
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:16,459
How many Sophies do you think there are
on this planet?

928
01:19:19,839 --> 01:19:22,173
Don't wait 50 years like I did.

929
01:19:25,803 --> 01:19:28,471
Go. Go! Go!

930
01:20:19,523 --> 01:20:22,233
I missed you so much! So much.

931
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:46,466
...in person because I couldn't
send you an e-mail,

932
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:51,763
because it was... It just didn't make sense,
because I know you were having...

933
01:20:52,932 --> 01:20:54,307
One second.

934
01:20:54,725 --> 01:20:56,893
Hello? Hey. Yeah, yeah.

935
01:20:58,145 --> 01:21:01,689
We just have to sort out all the deliveries
that we need to make. I mean...

936
01:21:38,978 --> 01:21:40,353
What happened?

937
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:42,564
You don't like the ending?

938
01:21:42,648 --> 01:21:44,899
No, the ending's fine.
It’s actually quite moving.

939
01:21:44,984 --> 01:21:47,694
But what happened to the people?
I mean, are they still together?

940
01:21:47,778 --> 01:21:50,989
What about... What about the kid?
What about Charlie? Where's he?

941
01:21:52,116 --> 01:21:54,701
I don't know. I didn't keep in touch.

942
01:21:58,163 --> 01:22:00,039
Do you have any advice?

943
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:03,876
I think you should buy stock in Alitalia,

944
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:08,006
'cause all the ladies are gonna be flocking
to Verona.

945
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:09,924
Are you gonna publish this?

946
01:22:10,009 --> 01:22:13,011
Yeah, l’m gonna publish it.
It’s a good story.

947
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:15,138
You got anything else for me?

948
01:22:15,848 --> 01:22:17,724
No, not at the moment.

949
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:25,273
Oh, my God.

950
01:22:30,321 --> 01:22:32,780
You said Tuscan gold, right? Tuscan gold?

951
01:22:33,365 --> 01:22:34,949
Look. This is yellow.

952
01:22:35,034 --> 01:22:37,702
Yellow. Tuscan gold. Yellow.
I mean, there's no Tuscany, there's no gold.

953
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:39,621
- It’s just like Limoncello, you know.
- Sure.

954
01:22:39,705 --> 01:22:41,039
- Yeah? Can we do it again?
- Yeah. Yeah.

955
01:22:41,123 --> 01:22:42,832
- Yeah? All right, all right, all right.
- Let's go. Come on.

956
01:22:42,916 --> 01:22:44,667
Let's try it again.

957
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:46,919
- Hey, Sophie.
- Hi.

958
01:22:47,546 --> 01:22:49,547
Hey, how's your day been?

959
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:53,092
- I showed my story to Bobby.
- Did he like it?

960
01:22:53,927 --> 01:22:55,887
Yeah, he's gonna print it.

961
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:57,221
- Print it?
- Yeah.

962
01:22:57,306 --> 01:22:58,931
Wow! Wow. That's pretty great, huh?

963
01:22:59,016 --> 01:23:00,725
- I know. Did you read it?
- Yeah, yeah.

964
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:04,020
- No. I...
- Last night I left it out for you to read.

965
01:23:04,104 --> 01:23:07,482
I don't need to.
I mean, I know it's gonna be great.

966
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:09,567
Plus, l’m gonna see it...
l’m gonna see it when it comes out.

967
01:23:09,652 --> 01:23:10,652
That's why I prefer to buy it.

968
01:23:10,736 --> 01:23:12,070
- You know, l’m surprised, like...
- Yeah.

969
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:13,946
- You know? Like...
- Watch out! Watch out!

970
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:16,658
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

971
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:33,216
- Thanks for lunch.
- Oh, my God. You so deserve this.

972
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:34,676
I want to be your fact checker for life.

973
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,803
Don't ever think
about going anywhere else, ever. Ever.

974
01:23:36,887 --> 01:23:38,638
I promise.

975
01:23:38,722 --> 01:23:40,390
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

976
01:23:40,474 --> 01:23:42,975
Sophie, these messages are for you.

977
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:44,310
Oh!

978
01:23:44,395 --> 01:23:46,896
- And a letter came for you.
- Thank you.

979
01:23:48,065 --> 01:23:49,440
New Yorker.

980
01:23:55,656 --> 01:23:59,367
We were both young when I first saw you

981
01:23:59,451 --> 01:24:02,870
I close my eyes and the flashback starts

982
01:24:02,955 --> 01:24:05,289
l’m standing there

983
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:09,544
On a balcony in summer air

984
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:15,717
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns

985
01:24:15,801 --> 01:24:19,053
I see you make your way through the crowd

986
01:24:19,138 --> 01:24:21,723
And say hello

987
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:25,435
Little did I know

988
01:24:27,563 --> 01:24:31,357
That you were Romeo
You were throwing pebbles

989
01:24:31,442 --> 01:24:35,194
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet

990
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:37,905
And I was crying on the staircase

991
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:42,034
Begging you please don't go

992
01:24:58,844 --> 01:25:00,762
Hey, what's that smell? What...

993
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:03,765
Hey, Alfonzo, Alfonzo.
No, no, no, no. We said...

994
01:25:03,849 --> 01:25:05,600
We said we were gonna sweat
the onion, yeah.

995
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:07,852
No, this is caramelized.
No. Sweat. Sweat, okay?

996
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:10,313
I don't know where you got that from.
Okay, come on, do it again.

997
01:25:11,565 --> 01:25:12,607
Hi.

998
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:15,026
Hey, Sophie.

999
01:25:17,905 --> 01:25:20,156
Hey, Sophie. How're you doing?

1000
01:25:21,575 --> 01:25:23,326
Everything all right?

1001
01:25:25,078 --> 01:25:27,079
Lorenzo and Claire are getting married.

1002
01:25:27,164 --> 01:25:28,998
Really? Wow.

1003
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:31,459
- When?
- On Saturday.

1004
01:25:32,169 --> 01:25:34,587
Saturday? This Saturday? Yeah?

1005
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:38,758
Yeah. L’m gonna go.

1006
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:41,052
Alone.

1007
01:25:43,305 --> 01:25:44,472
Alone?

1008
01:25:49,853 --> 01:25:52,939
Guys, can you step out
of the kitchen, please?

1009
01:25:53,023 --> 01:25:55,107
Yeah, everyone. Yeah, just leave...
Leave everything as it is.

1010
01:25:55,192 --> 01:25:56,901
It’s fine, it's fine, it's fine.

1011
01:26:01,949 --> 01:26:05,243
Everyone, please!
Just out of the kitchen, come on.

1012
01:26:05,869 --> 01:26:07,078
Come on.

1013
01:26:07,454 --> 01:26:09,288
- Wait. No, no, no. Sophie, wait...
- No, no, no. Just...

1014
01:26:09,373 --> 01:26:11,499
Let me get this out. Please?

1015
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:17,964
I really don't know what this is anymore.

1016
01:26:19,633 --> 01:26:21,884
I don't know what we're doing.

1017
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:26,055
I mean, we went on vacation
and we didn't spend any time together.

1018
01:26:26,139 --> 01:26:28,683
Yeah, because you were busy writing.

1019
01:26:29,142 --> 01:26:30,226
- I didn't mind.
- Yeah, but...

1020
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:32,019
- I didn't mind.
- I know you didn't mind.

1021
01:26:32,104 --> 01:26:33,771
- And you were busy.
- Come on...

1022
01:26:33,856 --> 01:26:35,398
You went to Livorno and I didn't mind.

1023
01:26:35,482 --> 01:26:38,359
- No, no, no, Sophie! No, no, no...
- No... Which is what l’m saying.

1024
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:41,320
Victor, we went on, like, a honeymoon

1025
01:26:42,322 --> 01:26:45,408
and we didn't mind
being apart from each other.

1026
01:26:46,743 --> 01:26:48,202
It’s not supposed to be that way.

1027
01:26:48,287 --> 01:26:51,831
We're supposed to want to be
with each other all the time.

1028
01:26:54,543 --> 01:26:57,670
Well, I wish I could tell you
that things are gonna be different

1029
01:26:57,754 --> 01:27:00,089
and that l’m gonna be different,

1030
01:27:01,091 --> 01:27:02,300
but I...

1031
01:27:03,844 --> 01:27:06,596
- This is who I am.
- I know, but I love...

1032
01:27:07,806 --> 01:27:09,557
I love who you are.

1033
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:11,475
But l’ve changed.

1034
01:27:16,481 --> 01:27:18,107
It’s not working.

1035
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:40,046
I have to go, Victor.

1036
01:27:43,216 --> 01:27:47,219
Romeo, save me, l’ve been feeling so alone

1037
01:27:47,304 --> 01:27:50,932
I keep waiting for you but you never come

1038
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:54,685
Is this in my head?
I don't know what to think

1039
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:58,689
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

1040
01:27:58,774 --> 01:28:01,233
And said, marry me Juliet

1041
01:28:01,318 --> 01:28:03,152
You'll never have to be alone

1042
01:28:03,236 --> 01:28:07,114
I love you and that's all I really know

1043
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:11,535
I talked to your dad
Go pick out a white dress

1044
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:16,707
It’s a love story, baby, just say yes

1045
01:28:27,219 --> 01:28:32,306
'Cause we were both young
when I first saw you

1046
01:28:33,058 --> 01:28:34,850
- Sophie?
- Hi.

1047
01:28:36,269 --> 01:28:37,353
- Hi.
- Hey!

1048
01:28:37,437 --> 01:28:38,479
Hi.

1049
01:28:40,649 --> 01:28:43,651
Can't believe you're here.
You look beautiful.

1050
01:28:44,111 --> 01:28:46,529
When did you get in?
Where are you staying?

1051
01:28:46,613 --> 01:28:48,239
I haven't figured that out yet.

1052
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:50,491
Well, no need. You'll stay here.

1053
01:28:50,575 --> 01:28:53,244
Lorenzo wouldn't have it any other way.

1054
01:28:54,037 --> 01:28:55,788
I hope so. How is...

1055
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:59,041
How's our great Lorenzo?
Is he as amazing as ever?

1056
01:28:59,126 --> 01:29:00,918
- Even more so.
- Yeah?

1057
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:07,758
- Actually, I wanna just...
- There you are!

1058
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:12,096
I think we're ready in there,
and she'll be here any second.

1059
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:14,932
Sophie, this is Patricia.

1060
01:29:16,768 --> 01:29:17,977
Hi.

1061
01:29:18,061 --> 01:29:19,311
The Sophie?

1062
01:29:19,396 --> 01:29:20,604
The Sophie.

1063
01:29:20,689 --> 01:29:23,691
It is so nice to finally meet you.

1064
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:28,446
- Well, l’ll see you inside.
- Okay.

1065
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:31,115
- Don't trip.
- As if l’m not nervous enough.

1066
01:29:32,075 --> 01:29:33,409
- Bye.
- Bye.

1067
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:38,873
Okay.

1068
01:29:38,957 --> 01:29:42,251
- It’s great to see you.
- L’m gonna go in. I will...

1069
01:29:43,003 --> 01:29:46,005
- I'll... l’ll see you after, okay?
- Okay. Yep.

1070
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:55,139
- Hi.
- Hi.

1071
01:29:56,475 --> 01:29:59,018
- Hi, Sophie.
- L’m so happy to see you.

1072
01:30:01,646 --> 01:30:03,981
- How are you? How are you?
- L’m happy to see you.

1073
01:30:04,066 --> 01:30:05,858
Beautiful. Beautiful.

1074
01:30:09,946 --> 01:30:10,988
Boy!

1075
01:30:11,865 --> 01:30:13,908
- We're here.
- It’s amazing.

1076
01:32:09,566 --> 01:32:14,653
I just want to say thank you
on behalf of myself and my lovely wife,

1077
01:32:15,238 --> 01:32:16,864
la mia bella Claire!

1078
01:32:20,327 --> 01:32:22,244
And now it's your turn.

1079
01:32:23,496 --> 01:32:25,039
- Well...
- Go on.

1080
01:32:26,291 --> 01:32:27,791
Dear friends,

1081
01:32:28,668 --> 01:32:32,254
50 years ago,
I went to Juliet's house in Verona.

1082
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:37,134
I wrote her a letter
and I asked her a question.

1083
01:32:37,219 --> 01:32:41,555
And two months ago, I received a reply.

1084
01:32:43,683 --> 01:32:45,643
And without that letter,

1085
01:32:47,938 --> 01:32:50,231
none of us would be here today.

1086
01:32:53,401 --> 01:32:57,821
Sophie, would you mind
if I read out the words you wrote to me?

1087
01:32:59,783 --> 01:33:01,116
All right?

1088
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:05,871
"Dear Claire, 'what' and 'if'

1089
01:33:06,289 --> 01:33:10,501
"are two words as non-threatening
as words can be.

1090
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:13,170
"But put them together, side by side,

1091
01:33:13,255 --> 01:33:17,216
"and they have the power
to haunt you for the rest of your life.

1092
01:33:17,968 --> 01:33:25,307
"What if?

1093
01:33:26,601 --> 01:33:29,186
"I don't know how your story ended,

1094
01:33:29,271 --> 01:33:32,356
"but if what you felt then was true love

1095
01:33:32,732 --> 01:33:34,775
"then it's never too late.

1096
01:33:36,945 --> 01:33:40,155
"If it was true then,
why wouldn't it be true now?

1097
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:43,659
"You need only the courage

1098
01:33:44,244 --> 01:33:46,120
"to follow your heart.

1099
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:50,332
"I don't know
what a love like Juliet's feels like,

1100
01:33:50,792 --> 01:33:55,212
"a love to leave loved ones for,
a love to cross oceans for,

1101
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:59,258
"but l’d like to believe,
if I ever were to feel it,

1102
01:34:00,385 --> 01:34:03,053
"that l’d have the courage to seize it.

1103
01:34:08,143 --> 01:34:10,269
"And, Claire, if you didn't,

1104
01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:13,939
"I hope one day that you will.

1105
01:34:18,194 --> 01:34:19,653
"All my love,

1106
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:21,739
"Juliet"

1107
01:34:48,433 --> 01:34:50,976
I'll be right back, all right, Gran?

1108
01:35:07,535 --> 01:35:14,833
Sophie?

1109
01:35:23,843 --> 01:35:25,177
Of course!

1110
01:35:25,428 --> 01:35:26,970
- A balcony.
- Well.

1111
01:35:27,055 --> 01:35:29,223
What are you doing up there?

1112
01:35:29,307 --> 01:35:30,766
L’m gonna go.

1113
01:35:31,226 --> 01:35:32,351
Why?

1114
01:35:32,435 --> 01:35:34,728
Because this is really painful.

1115
01:35:36,523 --> 01:35:41,110
I should have realized sooner, but I didn't,
or I guess maybe I couldn't,

1116
01:35:43,488 --> 01:35:46,281
but Victor and I aren't together anymore.

1117
01:35:47,659 --> 01:35:52,079
- And I guess I came back hoping that...
- Wait, wait. You're not engaged?

1118
01:35:53,957 --> 01:35:54,998
No.

1119
01:35:56,334 --> 01:35:58,001
But it's too late.

1120
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:00,796
It’s clearly too late.

1121
01:36:02,799 --> 01:36:06,844
And it really doesn't matter anymore
because, honestly,

1122
01:36:10,515 --> 01:36:11,890
I love you.

1123
01:36:15,311 --> 01:36:17,813
I can't believe I just said that.

1124
01:36:17,897 --> 01:36:20,899
But I do, I love you. It doesn't...

1125
01:36:20,984 --> 01:36:22,317
I mean, it shouldn't matter to you,

1126
01:36:22,402 --> 01:36:26,238
- because you're here with Patricia.
- Patricia?

1127
01:36:26,322 --> 01:36:28,782
And you should be back with her right now.

1128
01:36:28,867 --> 01:36:32,119
Patricia is my cousin. She's my cousin.

1129
01:36:32,203 --> 01:36:34,705
- How is that legal?
- No...

1130
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:38,125
Sophie... No.

1131
01:36:38,209 --> 01:36:40,586
No, no, no. Let me explain!

1132
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:43,797
Sophie, l’m so stupid. There's two Patricias.

1133
01:36:44,591 --> 01:36:45,799
There's my cousin, who's here,

1134
01:36:45,884 --> 01:36:49,136
and the one
that l’ve completely forgotten about.

1135
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:52,055
More importantly, there's only one Sophie.

1136
01:36:53,558 --> 01:36:55,893
Now, would you please come down?

1137
01:36:56,853 --> 01:37:00,147
Wait, Charlie. Charlie, stop.
What are you doing?

1138
01:37:01,691 --> 01:37:03,984
Charlie, what are you doing?

1139
01:37:04,068 --> 01:37:08,071
Listen to me.
Listen to me very, very carefully.

1140
01:37:09,032 --> 01:37:14,119
I live in London, a gorgeous, vibrant,
historic city that I happen to love living in.

1141
01:37:14,954 --> 01:37:17,414
You live in New York,
which is highly overrated.

1142
01:37:17,499 --> 01:37:18,832
- Pardon me?

1143
01:37:20,043 --> 01:37:22,753
But since the Atlantic Ocean
is a bit wide to cross every day,

1144
01:37:22,837 --> 01:37:26,215
swimming, boating or flying,
I suggest we flip for it.

1145
01:37:28,092 --> 01:37:29,843
What are you saying?

1146
01:37:29,928 --> 01:37:32,471
And if those terms are unacceptable,

1147
01:37:33,264 --> 01:37:35,140
leaving London will be a pleasure,

1148
01:37:35,225 --> 01:37:38,644
as long as you're waiting for me
on the other side.

1149
01:37:39,604 --> 01:37:41,480
'Cause the truth is, Sophie,

1150
01:37:42,732 --> 01:37:47,861
I am madly, deeply, truly,
passionately in love with you.

1151
01:37:49,405 --> 01:37:50,614
You are?

1152
01:37:51,991 --> 01:37:53,116
I am.

1153
01:37:56,955 --> 01:37:59,122
- Are you gonna kiss me?
- Yeah.

1154
01:37:59,666 --> 01:38:00,791
Yeah.

1155
01:38:02,418 --> 01:38:04,127
Oh, my God!

1156
01:38:05,672 --> 01:38:07,005
Charlie!

1157
01:38:08,007 --> 01:38:10,676
I can't believe I just did that.

1158
01:38:11,135 --> 01:38:12,177
Hi.

1159
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:15,389
Are you okay?

1160
01:38:15,682 --> 01:38:17,975
Please tell me no one saw that.

1161
01:38:21,563 --> 01:38:23,063
Nobody saw it.

1162
01:38:25,483 --> 01:38:27,901
Good. That's good.

1163
01:38:31,948 --> 01:38:33,407
Can you move?

1164
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,661
Only my lips.

1165
01:38:44,711 --> 01:38:48,463
What if we were made for each other

1166
01:38:48,548 --> 01:38:52,467
Born to become best friends and lovers

1167
01:38:52,552 --> 01:38:55,679
I want to stay right here
in this moment with you

1168
01:38:55,763 --> 01:38:59,558
Over and over and over again

1169
01:39:00,351 --> 01:39:03,895
What if this could be a real love

1170
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:07,399
A love, a love, yeah

1171
01:39:07,483 --> 01:39:11,194
I don't know what to think

1172
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:15,032
Is this real or just a dream?

1173
01:39:15,116 --> 01:39:19,036
In my heart is where you'll be

1174
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:23,540
I'll keep waiting till we meet

1175
01:39:27,962 --> 01:39:31,506
What if we were made for each other

1176
01:39:31,883 --> 01:39:35,552
Born to become best friends and lovers

1177
01:39:35,845 --> 01:39:38,930
I want to stay right here
in this moment with you

1178
01:39:39,015 --> 01:39:42,768
Over and over and over again

1179
01:39:43,645 --> 01:39:47,147
What if this could be a real love

1180
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:50,692
A love, a love, yeah

1181
01:39:52,278 --> 01:39:55,489
I write our names down in the sand

1182
01:39:56,491 --> 01:40:00,118
Picturing all our plans

1183
01:40:00,203 --> 01:40:02,496
I close my eyes and I can see

1184
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:06,416
You, and you ask, "Will you marry me?"

1185
01:40:08,670 --> 01:40:12,589
Is it made up in my mind?

1186
01:40:12,674 --> 01:40:16,426
Am I crazy just wasting time?

1187
01:40:16,886 --> 01:40:21,848
I think this could be love
l’m serious

1188
01:40:23,059 --> 01:40:26,853
What if we were made for each other

1189
01:40:26,938 --> 01:40:30,816
Born to become best friends and lovers

1190
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:33,944
I want to stay right here
in this moment with you

1191
01:40:34,028 --> 01:40:38,699
Over and over and over again

1192
01:40:38,783 --> 01:40:42,202
What if this could be a real love?

1193
01:40:42,286 --> 01:40:45,747
A love, a love, yeah

1194
01:40:46,624 --> 01:40:50,168
Boy, you know you really make my heart stop

1195
01:40:50,253 --> 01:40:53,004
Stop, stop

1196
01:40:55,133 --> 01:40:58,677
Oh, what if this is real love?

1197
01:40:59,137 --> 01:41:02,723
What if this is real love?

1198
01:41:02,807 --> 01:41:05,642
Oh, boy, you make my heart stop

1199
01:41:05,727 --> 01:41:10,063
You make my heart stop

1200
01:41:11,232 --> 01:41:12,983
Yeah
