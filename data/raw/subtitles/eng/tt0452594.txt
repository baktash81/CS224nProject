1
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:34,563
Come on, come on, come on.
All right, here we go.

2
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,343
Take a seat, buddy!

3
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:53,444
Come on.
It was a good play.

4
00:00:57,857 --> 00:00:59,051
Are you gonna be
like this all day?

5
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,285
I don't know. Is it gonna
be like this all day?

6
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,657
I don't know.
It's up to you.

7
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:02,854
I have no room to sit.
I got no room to sit.

8
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:03,918
I'm sitting next to
a guy who's sitting

9
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,430
like he's at home on the
toilet with his legs spread.

10
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:07,056
Please don't crowd people.
Relax, please. Look at me.

11
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:08,498
I am relaxed.
Look how I'm sitting.

12
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,729
Why are you sitting like that?
Because... What do you think?

13
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:11,964
Why'd you wake me up
for this shit?

14
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:13,767
Because I'm trying to relax
and have a nice day.

15
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,240
Sweating in the sun
like a Tijuana whore.

16
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,207
Ice-cold soda!

17
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:20,908
Get your soda here!

18
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,008
On the right.
Coming down there.
Pass that on down there.

19
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,418
Hot dog guy, can I get six
hot dogs down here, please?

20
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,012
Right away.
And make it right, please.

21
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,251
You know, with the mustard
and the ketchup and the relish.

22
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:33,758
Don't make me
hit you up for more.

23
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,624
I thought we were going
to Wiener Circle after this.

24
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:38,129
We will.
Then why are you getting hot dogs?

25
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:41,429
Pass this down, please.
You can keep the change.

26
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:43,328
Do you want
one of the hot dogs?

27
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,234
You can have a hot...
You want a hot dog?

28
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,329
Do you want a hot dog, miss?

29
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:47,634
No. Thank you.
You can have one.

30
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,038
That's okay.
Go ahead.
You can have a hot dog.

31
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,098
No, I don't want one.
Excuse me, sir?

32
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:51,541
Would you mind passing the
lady one of the hot dogs?

33
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,669
I'm good, thanks.
You don't have to share.

34
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:54,508
You can have your own.
Thanks. That's really nice of you.

35
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:55,878
Just have one, please.
Okay, give me a hot dog.

36
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,918
Somebody give her a hot dog.
I got... The big guy can't eat all of them. Have one.

37
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:00,919
Have you ever had one before?
A hot dog?

38
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,455
At the ballpark?
I have. I believe I have.

39
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:04,581
Okay, good.
Thank you.

40
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:06,488
Well, enjoy this one.
Thanks.

41
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:08,657
Do you like mustard?
No, I'm okay.

42
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:11,356
It's much better
with a topping. Here.

43
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:14,359
I'm just kidding,
I'll give you two.

44
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,966
Cheers!
Thanks.

45
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,272
We'll share it.

46
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:27,240
It's a good dog.
I like the hot dog. I know.

47
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,206
That's nice.

48
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,113
You have a problem with
me eating a hot dog, guy?

49
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:32,776
I'm trying to watch the game
and have a hot dog.

50
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:35,753
I'll smack him in his head.
No, just leave him alone.

51
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:54,535
You want to go get a drink?
No.

52
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,435
I'm with somebody, sorry.

53
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,773
Who? The guy with the
tucked-in shirt and the visor?

54
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,643
What, is that like a brother?
The guy was not your brother, then.

55
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:02,908
Who is this guy?
He's not my brother.

56
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:04,973
Who's this...
I'm getting mad now.
I'm jealous. Who is this guy?

57
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:06,518
Who are you?
I don't know.
I'm kidding with you.

58
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,611
Who's the guy with
the tucked-in stuff?
Is that a boyfriend?

59
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,882
It's...

60
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,254
I'm going.
Do you think
you'll marry him?

61
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,122
What?
'Cause I know
you've thought about it.

62
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,685
The first time
you laid eyes on him,
you probably thought,

63
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:20,221
"I wonder if I could marry
this guy in plaid shorts who
tucks his shirt in. No way.' '

64
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,927
Then when you kissed him,
you said, "I can't believe it.

65
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,663
"I had a lot to drink
tonight. I'm kissing
the tucked-in guy.' '

66
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:27,103
My point is, if you're
not gonna marry him...
Yeah.

67
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:28,333
...and if it's not forever,

68
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:31,002
then you really don't have
anything to lose in
taking me up on my offer.

69
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:33,944
Well, I'm gonna go.
Okay. Me, too.

70
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,981
Okay.
To where? On an
ice-breaking first date?

71
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,778
Well, no, I don't think...
Listen.

72
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,715
If you want to stay
off the market
while you're with

73
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,186
I'm-not-the-one-
but-I'm-comfortable,
then you can do that.

74
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:43,654
But for all you know,
I just offered you

75
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,214
a get-out-of-bored-love-
for-free card
with no strings attached.

76
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,725
God, you're crazy.
No, I'm not crazy.

77
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,625
And a lot of times people go,
"Oh, that's crazy,"

78
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,027
and then they go,
"It's genius.' '

79
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,792
That's what happened
when the person invented fire.

80
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:55,925
They burned that witch.
And guess what, then they got
warm and they ate good stuff.

81
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,833
Now, where are we headed to?
Let's not make this weird,

82
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,303
'cause I'm not good on dates.
No. You know what?

83
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,237
I'm better just to kind of
hang out and,
if we don't have fun,

84
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,296
I might go my separate way.
Okay.

85
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,037
I'm not committing
to anything. I'll go hang out
with you for a little bit.

86
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:06,976
That's not gonna happen.
But I can't say for sure.

87
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:19,044
<i>All right, all right,
everybody. Welcome to
Three Brothers Bus Tours.</i>

88
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:22,104
<i>I'm brother number two.
It's good to have you here.</i>

89
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,240
<i>That's right, there's plenty
of seats here up front.</i>

90
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:27,753
<i>I promise I won't bite.
I'm not a biter.
I'm psyched to have you here.</i>

91
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,278
<i>Okay, a couple quick
ground rules. Please
don't jump off the bus.</i>

92
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:32,688
<i>Weird. Not fun for anybody.</i>

93
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,750
<i>Also, no throwing objects
at pedestrians,</i>

94
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,692
<i>unless, of course,
they deserve it. Okay?</i>

95
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:39,732
<i>We are not at work today.
We are on vacation today.</i>

96
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,994
<i>And if you can't blow it
out here on the big funny bus,</i>

97
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,626
<i>where the hell can you?</i>

98
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,933
<i>I do split the tips
with my driver, Shondra.</i>

99
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,597
<i>We don't want her back out
turning tricks.</i>

100
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:51,074
<i>That was a weird time
for everyone.
Seriously. Honest to God.</i>

101
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,476
<i>And I was a customer.
Long time ago.</i>

102
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,014
<i>Come on, everybody,
let's get loose!</i>

103
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,282
<i>I'm gonna ask you once.
Show me that you mean it.</i>

104
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:02,583
<i>Don't make me ask you twice.
Are you ready to see Chicago?</i>

105
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,747
<i>Are you ready to see Chicago?</i>

106
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:07,850
<i>That's what I'm talking about.
Shondra, put this baby
in the air.</i>

107
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,953
<i>Let's get the blood flowing.
Let's get everyone up
and let's loosen it up.</i>

108
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,429
<i>Coming up here,
you're gonna notice</i>

109
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:15,524
<i>one of the only buildings
to survive the fire of 1871.</i>

110
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:19,128
<i>That is the original
Chicago Water Tower
and Pumping Station.</i>

111
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:23,206
Happy Holidays.
Marilyn Dean Gallery.

112
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,007
The artist was inspired
by the neoclassical movement.

113
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,067
No, she doesn't.

114
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:29,910
But wanted to reflect it
with an abstract bent.

115
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,006
Okay, bye-bye.

116
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,517
And how much is it?
$35,000.

117
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:37,384
Happy Holidays.
Marilyn Dean Gallery.
Hold, please.

118
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,654
Will you excuse me
for a moment?
Sure. Go ahead.

119
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,320
Christopher?
Yes, sweetie.

120
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,657
Hi, honey.
Hi.

121
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,366
Christmas was months ago.
Don't remind me.
I miss it so much.

122
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:53,402
Yeah, I know.
But today is not a holiday.

123
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,373
I know for a fact
that people like
my spirit on the phone

124
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,273
and they dig the energy
that I give them.

125
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:02,212
Okay. I'm just saying,
I don't think Marilyn Dean
will "dig" the energy.

126
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:05,114
Oh, no.
She's the one that told me
to be creative. So...

127
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,744
I know. It's just... Okay.
What is the next holiday
coming?

128
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,310
The Fourth of July,
is that what's next?

129
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,049
Well, if you want
to get technical,
there's Memorial Day,

130
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:13,148
there's Flag Day.

131
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,990
Some people recognize
Father's Day as a holiday.
I don't.

132
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:20,624
I get it. I get it.
Well, on those days
you can say, "Happy Holidays.' '

133
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,930
Every other day,
"Good morning, good afternoon,

134
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,470
"good evening,
Marilyn Dean Gallery.' '
Okay?

135
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,131
Okay.

136
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,107
I'm so sorry about that.
Oh, no.

137
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,875
So, now this is a new piece
by Zakrzewska.

138
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,779
What do you think of this?

139
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,611
Can I be honest with you?
Please.

140
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:45,649
Other than taking
an art history class
in college,

141
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:49,559
which I pretty much
slept through, I don't have
the first clue about art

142
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:53,326
or how to go about buying it.
I mean, like that painting.

143
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:58,398
I mean, I don't see the point
in buying something that
I could have done myself.

144
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,572
Yeah. I completely agree
with you.

145
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,142
You know, an art teacher
of mine once said,

146
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,704
"Never buy a piece of art
that you don't have to have.' '

147
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:13,250
You know, don't worry
about who the artist is
or how much it's worth.

148
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:17,221
I mean, you have to live
with it every day. You have
to walk by it every day.

149
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,817
You know, you have to
really love it. You have
to really appreciate it.

150
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,690
It's kind of like
picking a mate.

151
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,761
Hey, honey!
Hi.

152
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:31,769
How's it going?
It's good.

153
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:34,101
Oh, wow. You got
a lot happening.
I know.

154
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,971
Very exciting.
I am starving.

155
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,944
Oh, careful. That's really...
That's very hot.
Oh, that's hot, hot, hot.

156
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:41,570
Yep.
Jesus.

157
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:44,741
Hey, honey,
you've got to really...
You should get ready, okay?

158
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,307
Oh, you look great.
Thank you.

159
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:48,785
Got a lot of nice stuff.
Got a pizza.

160
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,923
All kinds of stuff.
Terrific.

161
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,721
I just need you
to decide what to...
You know, I did everything.

162
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,792
Gary?
Yeah?

163
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:08,797
Oh, come on! Really?
You got three lemons.

164
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,169
What my baby wants,
my baby gets. You know that.

165
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,837
Yeah, but I wanted 12.
Baby wanted 12.

166
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,176
Why would you want 12 lemons?

167
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,078
Because I'm making
a 12-lemon centerpiece.

168
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:23,178
So, no one's actually
even eating them?
They're just show lemons?

169
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:26,713
Yeah. They're just
show lemons. Shown in
the center of the table.

170
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:27,952
I'm glad you find that
amusing,

171
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,222
but I cannot fill a vase
with only three lemons.

172
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,764
Well,
can't you just use, like,
maybe a drinking glass?

173
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:33,924
I'm not gonna use
a drinking...

174
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,661
We could have
a smaller version
of a centerpiece.

175
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,760
I'm not gonna use
a drinking glass
for our centerpiece.

176
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:38,895
You know what?
I've got an idea.

177
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,168
Why don't we go ahead and
scratch the centerpiece idea
altogether,

178
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,106
because the chicken
that burnt my mouth

179
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,076
could maybe use
a little bit of lemon
on top of it.

180
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:50,673
Guess what? Now we've made
a better meal versus something
visually nice to look at.

181
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,749
What are you do...
What's happening here?
What are you doing?

182
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,380
What are you doing?
Oh, I had
such a long day on the bus.

183
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:59,651
I need a little bit
of down time.
My feet are killing me.

184
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,659
Gary, come on,
my feet are killing me, too.
I'm exhausted.

185
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,695
I worked all day.
Went to the market.

186
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:07,164
I cleaned this entire condo
and then I've been cooking
for the last three hours.

187
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,360
Come on. Help set the table.

188
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,095
Sweetheart.
What?

189
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,367
You've done such a great job
already. Don't you want
to finish it yourself

190
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,931
and have that personal power
of that accomplishment?

191
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,874
Set the table.
Listen to me.

192
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:22,141
Do you think that
when Michelangelo, right,

193
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,774
was painting
the Sixteenth Chapel,
that he said,

194
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,580
"Hey, guys, you know,
I did pretty good
on the first 15 chapels,

195
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,780
"but why don't you help me
design this one?

196
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,914
"And maybe
you could help me...
Give me a brush

197
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:35,119
"and you guys can grab brushes,
and we can all make a great chapel."

198
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,391
No, he didn't.
And you wanna know
what the results were?

199
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:39,863
A masterpiece.

200
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,661
Okay. It's the Sistine Chapel,
not the Sixteenth,

201
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:50,334
and I bet when Michelangelo
asked for 12 brushes,
they didn't bring him three.

202
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,969
Yeah. Okay, all the talking
is really starting
to drain me,

203
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,208
and now I'm gonna have to
watch the highlights later
to see what I missed here.

204
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:57,647
Honey, look, Gary, just...
Down time's important.

205
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,685
Gary, please just
take a shower, okay?
Down time's important.

206
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:00,980
'Cause this is what
I don't want to have happen.

207
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,250
I don't want the doorbell
to ring. I'm then forced
to answer the door,

208
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,291
entertain people,
and I'm still cooking dinner.

209
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:07,450
Yeah.
Okay?

210
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:11,462
You're absolutely right.
Let's do that. The second
that this inning's over...

211
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,054
Gary.
There's one out all ready.

212
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,463
They're gonna be here
in 20 minutes.

213
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:17,024
Baby, have you ever seen
a shower of mine take
more than four minutes?

214
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,127
Yes, I have. Come on.

215
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:20,001
Oh, great!

216
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,838
They're here. Okay.
Table's not set.
Dinner's not ready.

217
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,273
Would you please
just let my parents in?

218
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:25,833
I gotta jump in the shower.
What?

219
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,401
I gotta go.

220
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,107
Gary. Gary.

221
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,849
Well, seeing how
our families haven't
had many opportunities

222
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:42,485
to get to know one another,
we figured, what better way
than to break some bread?

223
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:45,894
So, everyone,
thank you for coming
and enjoy the meal.

224
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,365
Cheers.
Cheers, honey.

225
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,202
Mrs. Grobowski.
Nice to meet you.
Thank you.

226
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,398
Cheer with the sons.
Sweetheart,
cheers to you.

227
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:58,204
Darling, I see that you put
those Feng Shui books

228
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,472
that I sent to you
to good use.

229
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:03,071
This place is
so well balanced.
Thanks, Mom.

230
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,140
Yeah, the energy in this place
is just amazing.

231
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:06,275
Yes.

232
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:09,048
Well, the energy in the condo
might be a little more amazing

233
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,986
if we had a pool table.

234
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,526
Gary, we've already
discussed that.

235
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,395
We're gonna get a pool table
when we get a bigger place.

236
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,659
The place is plenty big now,
if you wanted a pool table
because...

237
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,598
Gary.
Yeah. You could take
the dining room table,

238
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:23,828
go ahead and move her
in the living room.

239
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,029
Really?
Plenty of room.

240
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,902
And put a dining room table
in the living room? Okay.

241
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,942
How do you...
I mean, what do you do
with a dining room table?

242
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,978
Eat on it.
We'd have no furniture
in the living...

243
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:34,603
Where's the furniture go?
All I'm saying is,

244
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,170
it would be nice
to be able to shoot some pool.

245
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,307
Well, this isn't a dorm.
Look, baby,
I completely understand.

246
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,874
There's halls and stuff.
I mean, you can go...

247
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:42,580
We will wait
and get a pool table
when we have a bigger place.

248
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,020
Thank you.

249
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:51,595
The food is outstanding.
It is delicious food.

250
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,688
It's outstanding.

251
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,630
Yeah, it really is nice.
Okay, everybody.

252
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,726
Time for the joke of the day.
Knock, knock.
Dad. Dad, come on.

253
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,100
Who's there?
Norma Lee.

254
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,331
Norma Lee, who?

255
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,931
Normally, I don't go around
knocking on doors,

256
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,739
but would you like to buy
an encyclopedia?
I got a joke.
I got a joke.

257
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,042
How's it going?
I got a joke for you.

258
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:12,845
What do you get when you cross
a gay Eskimo and a black guy?

259
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,484
All right, look,
I think we've had enough
with the jokes for tonight.

260
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,853
Thank you, though.
Let's just talk
with each other.

261
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:19,982
All right.

262
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,755
<i>I saw that Three Brothers
article in the Trib this week.</i>

263
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,353
Sounds like you guys are up
to some pretty exciting stuff.

264
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:30,368
Basically, our big goal is to
try to take Chicago tourism
by air, land and sea.

265
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,894
We're still in the ground
phase with the buses.

266
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:42,080
But as soon as we get
our infantry established,

267
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:45,514
then we'll take it
to the squids.
Yeah.

268
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,150
Boats. Boats.
Oh, boats.

269
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,350
As soon as we control
the waterway, then we'll
bring in air supports

270
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:56,292
and then we'll pretty much
control everything.

271
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,291
You know, Dennis,

272
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:03,196
the way your face lights up
when you describe
your ambitions,

273
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,134
it's really inspiring.

274
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:09,270
Oh, thanks.
Because I understand

275
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:12,174
how you feel that passion.

276
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:15,912
And sharing it
with other people, I think
that's what life's about.

277
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:19,212
I don't feel that about
boats and squibs... Squids?

278
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,445
Squids.
Sorry.

279
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,920
Yeah.
But I do feel it
about singing.

280
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,822
<i>With my a cappella group,
The Tone Rangers.</i>

281
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:36,226
Although it's not
as aggressive as your dream,

282
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:40,295
it's really
more of a brotherhood.
It's like a musical team.

283
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:44,270
It's like a symphony of guys.
Guy symphony.

284
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:48,009
And it's very hard
to describe the true magic

285
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,314
of a group of guys
singing in perfect harmony.

286
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,479
It's transcendent.

287
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,912
But it's still very real.

288
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:02,024
I guess the best way
to put it in words is just...

289
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,472
Even that doesn't do it.

290
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,776
That doesn't do it
because that's just
one person.

291
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:26,079
And what I'm talking about is
the pulse of the collective.

292
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,318
Oh, heck. Let me just
show you how it's done.

293
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:29,979
Dad, how about
a little percussion?

294
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:32,319
Tap-tap-tappy.
Tap-tap-tappy.

295
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,554
And, Mom, high-hat.

296
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:39,226
Good, Mom.
Excellent. And Gary!

297
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:43,097
On the kick drum! Come, come!
On the kick drum! Come, come!

298
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,001
That's Gary! Come, come
with the kick drum. Come!

299
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:49,802
Come, come with the kick drum.
Gary, on the kick drum.
Come, come.

300
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:53,743
That's Gary on the kick drum.
Go! And Gary. In the house.

301
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:54,904
Come, come.
I'm not with you.

302
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,312
Come, come.
With the kick drum.
Come, come.

303
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,010
I'm just not really
the kick drum kind of guy.

304
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:02,542
I'd rather be just a listener
and enjoy all the banging
that he's doing and the...

305
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:05,988
You know, Gary,
that's your prerogative.
That's your right, to listen.

306
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,424
Meantime, I've gotta talk
to Brooke about something.

307
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,189
It's called the bass line.
Excuse me.
Okay.

308
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,337
Good, Carol.

309
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,407
Good, Brooke.

310
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,939
Yes, Dennis.

311
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,516
Be nice.
Totally awesome.

312
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,852
<i>Move yourself</i>

313
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,825
<i>You always live your life</i>

314
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,293
<i>Never thinking of the future</i>

315
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,161
<i>Prove yourself</i>

316
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,927
<i>You are the move you make</i>

317
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,266
<i>Take your chances
win or loser</i>

318
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:54,328
<i>See yourself</i>

319
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:56,403
<i>You're every step you take</i>

320
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,569
<i>You and you
and that's the only way</i>

321
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:00,634
<i>Shake
Shake!</i>

322
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:01,736
<i>Shake yourself</i>

323
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,441
<i>You're every move you make</i>

324
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:07,246
<i>So the story goes</i>

325
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:08,614
Thank you so much.

326
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:10,279
Okay, bye.
Thank you so much.

327
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:11,947
It was great
to see you.
Okay. Come on.

328
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,389
Have a good night.
It was really nice, Gary.

329
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,484
Nice to see you. You, too.
Good to see you guys.

330
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:16,892
Thanks, Brookie.
Oh, honey.
Thank you, sweetie.

331
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:19,556
You're still
my favorite singer.
Stop it.

332
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:23,692
Love you, sis.
And I'd love for you
to come to a live performance

333
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,034
of The Tone Rangers
singing live. That's
something you'd really enjoy.

334
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,130
It was good seeing you.
Okay.

335
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,231
Thank you.
All right.

336
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,572
Bye, darling.
Thank you for such a...
Okay. Okay, Mom.

337
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,634
We'll see you soon.
Bye, dear. Thanks, darling.

338
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,009
See you later.
Okay, buddy.

339
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,310
Oh, now, are you sure
that we can't help you
clean up?

340
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,407
No, no. I think we're
gonna be great. We'll...
Yes?

341
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,009
So nice of you to offer,
but we got it. Thank you.

342
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,815
Oh, it was such fun.
Great.

343
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,150
I love you.
Great to see you.

344
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,622
Good night, sweetie.
Thank you so much.

345
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:46,316
I appreciate it.
Thank you so much.

346
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,521
All right, guys.
Bye-bye.

347
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:49,891
Bye-bye.
Thanks for coming.

348
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,589
Love you, too.

349
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:59,426
<i>Are you blind?</i>

350
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,602
<i>Oh, no, no! My demos!</i>

351
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,138
Well, I'm gonna
go do the dishes.
Cool.

352
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,908
It'd be nice if you helped me.
Damn it.

353
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,079
<i>Way to go!</i>

354
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,521
No problem. I'll get them
a little bit later.

355
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,581
I'm just gonna
hit the streets here
for a little bit.

356
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,819
Gary, come on,
I don't want to do them later.

357
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,657
Let's just do them now.
It'll take 15 minutes.

358
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:26,755
Honey, I am so exhausted.
I just honestly want
to relax for a little bit.

359
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:30,529
If I could just sit here,
let my food digest,

360
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:33,636
and just try to enjoy
the quiet for a little bit.

361
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:36,366
Get some! Get some! Get some!
That's what happens.

362
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,773
And we will...
You know, we can clean
the dishes tomorrow.

363
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,244
Gary, you know I don't like
waking up to a dirty kitchen.

364
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,781
Who cares?
I care! All right? I care!

365
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:47,812
I busted my ass all day
cleaning this house
and then cooking that meal.

366
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,286
And I worked today.
It would be nice
if you said thank you

367
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,289
and helped me with the dishes.

368
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:57,256
Fine. I'll help you
do the damn dishes.
Oh, come on. You know what?

369
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,853
No. See?
That's not what I want.

370
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,058
You just said that you want me
to help you do the dishes.

371
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:05,365
I want you to want
to do the dishes.
Why would I want to do dishes?

372
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:08,171
Why?
See, that's my whole point.

373
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:12,101
Let me see if I'm
following this, okay? Are you
telling me that you're upset

374
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:14,202
because I don't have
a strong desire
to clean dishes?

375
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,976
No. I'm upset because
you don't have a strong desire
to offer to do the dishes.

376
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,382
I just did.
After I asked you!

377
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:24,252
Jesus, Brooke,
you're acting crazy again.
Don't you call me crazy.
I am not crazy.

378
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,688
I didn't call you crazy.
You just did.

379
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:26,849
I didn't call you...
No, I didn't.

380
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,893
I said you're acting crazy.
You know what, Gary?

381
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:31,293
I asked you to do
one thing today,
one very simple thing,

382
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,456
to bring me 12 lemons
and you brought me three.

383
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:36,695
God damn it. If I knew
that it was gonna be
this much trouble,

384
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:39,259
I would have brought home
24 lemons. Even 100 lemons.

385
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,806
You know what I wish?
I wish everyone that was
at that goddamn table

386
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,397
had their own little private
bag of lemons.

387
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:44,669
Honest to God!
Gary, it's not
about the lemons.

388
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,903
Well, that's all
you're talking about.

389
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,446
I'm just saying
it'd be nice if you did
things that I asked.

390
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:52,279
It would be even nicer
if you did things without
me having to ask you!

391
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:57,480
Well, I do seem to remember
doing something for you
this morning

392
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:58,887
without you asking.

393
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:01,323
Gary, come on.
What? I'm serious. Come here.

394
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,327
You know what? I'm serious.
I really am.
I am, too.

395
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:06,592
Come on.
You knew I was working today
and I made that meal.

396
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:10,192
And you could have thought
to yourself, you know,
you could have said,

397
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,136
"Yeah, I think I'm gonna
get Brooke some flowers.' '

398
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:16,569
You said
on our very first date
that you don't like flowers,

399
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:18,576
that they're a waste of money.

400
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,072
Every girl likes flowers,
Gary.

401
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,373
You said that you
don't like flowers.

402
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,641
I'm supposed
to take that to mean
that you do like flowers?

403
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:26,479
No. This is not about...
You're not...
God, you're not getting it.

404
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:28,917
You're not getting this,
Gary, okay?
It's not about the lemons.

405
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:31,353
It's not about the flowers.
It's not about the dishes.

406
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:34,824
It's just about...
How many times do I have to
drop hints about the ballet?

407
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:37,191
You know I can't stand...
Brooke, come here.

408
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:40,595
We've talked about
the damn ballet.
I hate the goddamn ballet!

409
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,328
You got a bunch of dudes
in tights flopping around
for three hours.

410
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,336
It's like a medieval
techno show. It's a nightmare.

411
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,065
I sit there in a sweat.
The whole thing, I do,

412
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,232
wondering when the hell's
the goddamn nightmare
gonna end.

413
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,902
Go to a damn ballet.
It's not about you
loving the ballet, Gary.

414
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,172
It's about the
person that you love
loves the ballet

415
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,237
and you wanting to spend time
with that person.

416
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,407
Not when they're
at the ballet.

417
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,507
Okay. Forget the ballet!
Forget the ballet!
I will.

418
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,814
We don't go anywhere together.

419
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:06,019
We just went
to Ann Arbor together.
To Ann Arbor.

420
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,215
To the
Michigan-Notre Dame game.

421
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:13,724
You think screaming,
drunk kids and leprechauns
doing backflips, that's fun.

422
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,825
That's fun for me.
Come on, man.
I did that for you.

423
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:18,369
What do you...
How do you show up for me?

424
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:21,099
I'm up on the bus
every goddamn day for you!

425
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,765
Come on. You...
I'm busting my ass

426
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,809
to be the best tour guide
in the damn city,

427
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:26,935
so I can make enough money
to support both of us

428
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,741
and hopefully you won't
have to work one day.

429
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:30,975
I want to work.
All I ask, Brooke,

430
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,142
is that you show a little bit
of appreciation.

431
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:35,846
That I just get 20 minutes
to relax when I come home,

432
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:39,584
instead of being attacked
with questions and nagged
the whole damn time.

433
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:42,456
You think that I nag you?
That's all you do!

434
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:43,960
All you do is nag me!

435
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,156
"The bathroom's a mess.' '
"Your belt doesn't match.' '

436
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:48,222
"Hey, Gary, you should
probably go work out.' '

437
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,325
Nothing I ever do
is ever good enough!

438
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:53,428
I just want to be left
the hell alone!

439
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,806
Really? Is that
what you want, Gary?

440
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,212
Is that what you want?
Yeah.

441
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:05,306
That's what you want?
Yeah.

442
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,249
Fine. Great.
Do whatever the hell you want.

443
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:10,550
You leave your socks
all over this house,
dress like a pig,

444
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:14,157
play your stupid-ass
video game.
I don't care, I'm done.

445
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,723
What?
I'm done!
I don't deserve this.

446
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:20,663
I really do not deserve this.
I deserve somebody
who gives a shit.

447
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:25,431
I'm not spending one more
second of this life
with some inconsiderate prick!

448
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,261
You're a prick!

449
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:51,720
Addie, it just became
so clear tonight

450
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,815
how much he takes me
for granted.

451
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,522
<i>What happened?
Just the same old shit.</i>

452
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,790
I asked him to do one thing
and he didn't do it.

453
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:01,958
Then he complained
that he had to do anything,

454
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:04,627
and I just felt like
I had no choice.

455
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,261
No, sweetie,
you did have a choice, okay?

456
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,501
And it sounds like you
made the right one.
You respected yourself.

457
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:13,066
But it's just not what I want.
I don't want to break up
with him.

458
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:17,137
I don't. I just want him
to say thank you. I want him
to want to do the dishes.

459
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:20,013
I just want him to want
to take me to the ballet.

460
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:23,551
I want him to get me
12 lemons! You know...

461
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:30,127
I just want him to care
enough about this relationship
to want to work on it.

462
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:32,254
Okay, you know what?
I'm putting on my shoes

463
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,821
and I'm gonna be there
in 15 minutes.
No, Ad. Don't.

464
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,368
Please, I really don't
want to see anybody.
I really don't.

465
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:38,800
But, look, I'm worried
about you, okay?

466
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,065
And I can hear you in there
banging around your dishes.

467
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:43,937
And I don't want you
getting out your Clorox
and your rubber gloves,

468
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:46,978
and taking this out
on the kitchen.
Look, look, look.

469
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:52,545
Okay. Tonight just...
It just got a little
out of hand,

470
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:57,811
and hopefully
he's just gonna realize

471
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,325
that he's got some changes
to make and he's gonna...

472
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:06,190
He's gonna come home
and apologize.

473
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,330
Okay?
That's what's gonna happen.

474
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:14,533
I feel like, I don't...
You know, like, you dress
however you want to dress.

475
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:15,937
You know,
do whatever you want to do.

476
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:17,065
I'm done with
the relationship.
Whatever.

477
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:19,372
So, it's just kind of,
"You're done
with the relationship?"

478
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:20,877
Well, you're obviously
hurt about it.

479
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:22,413
She got to you. You're hurt.
I'm not.

480
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,038
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
She hurt you.

481
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:25,275
Will you look at me?
I'm not heartbroken.

482
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,681
I'm a little shocked.
I'm a little surprised.

483
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,549
Gary, you're devastated.
Now, what's the name
of the guy she's doing?

484
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,350
I'm gonna solve your problem.
What's his name?

485
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,550
What are you talking about?
Have you checked her e-mail?

486
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:34,683
I don't check e-mails.
I don't...

487
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,420
You can get a program
that records keystrokes.

488
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:39,019
It costs, like, 20 bucks.
Very easy to use. Okay?

489
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,555
You get a password, you check
her e-mail. You find out
everything about her.

490
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:43,931
That's how I found out
about the Puerto Rican

491
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,594
that Stacy was
running around with.
Okay.

492
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,661
You are reading
a little too much
into this situation.

493
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,400
There is no one she's
running around with, okay?

494
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:50,839
We had a fight
over the groceries
I brought home.

495
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,968
You're probably right.
She's probably not
sleeping with anybody.

496
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:54,375
No. Not what it's about.
Okay.

497
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,970
Maybe she's with
another guy, maybe not.
She's not.

498
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:58,481
I don't know.
I'm not Columbo. Okay?

499
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:02,213
But what we do know
is that she doesn't want
to be with you anymore.

500
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:08,357
I mean, I hate to be shitty
about it, and so cut and dry,
but let's face it.

501
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:11,486
She says she doesn't
want to be with you,
and I believe her.

502
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:13,588
Now, we gotta figure it out.
And you're gonna
need a place to go

503
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:15,826
and lick your wounds
while you get your head
right over this thing.

504
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,026
I don't need a place to go
and lick my wounds.

505
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:18,126
You're gonna stay with me.

506
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,568
I'm not gonna hear it.
Look it...

507
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,629
I'm not moving
out of the place.
Oh, you're not moving out.

508
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:23,640
No. I put money in the place.
I put half my money
in the place.

509
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:26,074
You're obviously not
the one calling the shots
in this case.

510
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,135
Yeah, but I own the place.

511
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,373
With her.
Yeah.

512
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:31,210
But it's not up to her
who gets to keep
the goddamn place.

513
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:33,443
If you find out
who she's sleeping with,
maybe we could leverage it.

514
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,145
I want you to listen to me.
You listen to me.

515
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,585
I'm gonna leave you a key.
I don't need a key.

516
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:37,883
Why?
'Cause she's gonna put...

517
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,389
She's gonna move out
of the place, Johnny.

518
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:41,948
Did she say
she was moving out?
She will.
She's gonna move out.

519
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:43,654
Oh, she's...
I'm gonna keep the place.

520
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:45,218
I'm not moving
out of the place.

521
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:46,820
I'll leave you a key.

522
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,282
Hey, how's it going?
I almost got it.

523
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:20,221
Yeah.
You know, I was thinking.

524
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,656
You know what you should do,

525
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:23,591
is you should find somebody
who looks like Brooke,

526
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:26,027
but even hotter and, you know,
bang the shit out of her.

527
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,725
What the hell's
wrong with you?
What?

528
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,462
Logs.
Just fix the damn engine.

529
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:34,096
I am fixing
the goddamn engine.
I need your tour logs.

530
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:35,867
I'm off the clock, okay?

531
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,206
Well, I cannot
file the quarterlies
until I have your log.

532
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,303
I'm going through
a little bit of a
life change here, Dennis.

533
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:46,214
I would really appreciate
a little bit of sensitivity,
please.

534
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:53,388
I know they're
both French, but that has
nothing to do with it.

535
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:57,326
Because Manet was earlier
and... No. Monet and Manet
are very different things.

536
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:58,692
I'm sorry, I beg to differ.

537
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:01,163
Excuse me, sir, can I have her
call you back personally?

538
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:03,723
Yes. Okay, thank you.
Sorry. Brooke?

539
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,170
I am so sorry.
What?

540
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,032
Come here.

541
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:13,934
Oh, honey, your mom called
and told me everything.

542
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:15,377
Oh, Jesus.

543
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:20,246
Good morning, Marilyn.

544
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,954
Morning.
I'll go water the plants.

545
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,325
I understand
you had a long night.
Tell me everything.

546
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:29,826
"Everything.' '
I couldn't possibly...

547
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:31,555
Then don't.
My time is pressing.

548
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:33,995
What I want is for you
to take the rest
of the day off.

549
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:36,124
Oh, no.
No, that's not necessary.

550
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:39,569
Who am I?

551
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:42,637
Marilyn Dean.
And where are we?

552
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:48,244
The Marilyn Dean Gallery.
And of whom is that portrait?

553
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:56,911
That is Marilyn Dean.
Yeah.

554
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:02,390
You know, your personal life
is your personal life.

555
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:05,691
But you look like shit.
And when you look like shit,

556
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:09,062
Marilyn Dean looks like shit,
and now it is my business.

557
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:13,126
And when it comes to my
business, I don't like
anything that's distracting.

558
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:17,371
So, I want you to take
the rest of the day off
to be sad

559
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:22,004
and then come back
to work tomorrow ready
to take care of business.

560
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,774
Got it?

561
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,881
Oh, hey, Brooke. How are you?

562
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:01,642
What the hell are you doing?

563
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:05,621
Well, my whole life,
I always wanted my own place
with my own pool table.

564
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,180
I finally got my own place,

565
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:10,625
but you would not allow me
to have a pool table.

566
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:15,495
I just kind of figured
I'd rectify that today.
And it does feel good.

567
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:19,366
I'm gonna go ahead
and put the four ball
in the corner pocket.

568
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,665
Nice.

569
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,071
I'm sorry, can I...
A little room for the
shooter, please?

570
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:30,180
It's hard to shoot
with someone standing...
Thank you.

571
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:38,151
Wow.

572
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:43,787
Well, I guess he feels
threatened that you broke up
with him and he's acting out.

573
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:48,120
Okay, look, Brooke,
men are like children.
You know? And they...

574
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:52,228
Sweetie, it's a
figure of speech. It's Brooke.
And I love you so much.

575
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:57,104
And you're my man
and you know that.
You're amazing. I love you.

576
00:32:57,508 --> 00:33:00,773
Listen, and they're gonna
test boundaries to see
what they can get away with.

577
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:03,075
<i>I think there's three things
that Gary needs to know.</i>

578
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:07,379
One, this type of behavior
is not unnoticed.
Two, it's not acceptable.

579
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:11,650
And three, you know,
you're definitely not gonna
tolerate it. Right?

580
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,116
Yes.

581
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:16,422
<i>And Brooke, remember,
we're always owning
our actions, right?</i>

582
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:19,122
<i>And we're always
healthy with it, yes?</i>

583
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:21,460
Yes.

584
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,097
I don't wanna finish the game.
I got showings, okay?

585
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,261
I gotta buy the cookie spray.
I gotta clean up the dog.

586
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:31,035
And now I'm really leaving
'cause I don't want
to hear that. Okay?

587
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:33,907
Thank you for the pool.
Thank you for the snacks.

588
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,116
I'm going to get a cab.
I'll split it with you.

589
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:59,732
What are you, 12?
Brooke, that is not healthy.

590
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:01,897
I'm trying to make a point.
And what is that point?

591
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:04,498
My point's your point.
Your three points.

592
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:08,739
That it's not unnoticed,
that it was not acceptable,

593
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,405
and that it would definitely
not be tolerated.

594
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:13,245
Not exactly what I meant.

595
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:18,255
Unbelievable.

596
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:23,255
I knew it!
Hey, gang.

597
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:26,387
Found my shirt on the floor.
Thanks for laying it out.

598
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:32,535
Gary, are you here
for couples bowling?
Yeah.

599
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:36,568
Well, don't you think
you and I should discuss
something first?

600
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:39,007
Like what? How your
47 average is killing us?

601
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,671
Okay. Great. No.

602
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:46,012
Gary, this is couples bowling.
And since you and I
are no longer a couple,

603
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:48,012
because you have chosen

604
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:51,988
not to participate
constructively
in our relationship,

605
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,851
we're now singles.

606
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:57,520
So, there's not room
for two singles on the team.

607
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,066
Why do you look confused?

608
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:09,435
I don't have any idea
what's happening.
I've come to play on the team.

609
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,266
Look, Gary, I just don't think
it's a good idea

610
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:14,140
for you and I to be around
each other any more
than we have to right now.

611
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:16,339
I completely agree.
Maybe you should go
play some pinball.

612
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:19,440
No, I think you should leave.
Okay.

613
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:25,678
Brooke, when a man makes
a commitment to a team,
he honors that commitment.

614
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:30,427
He doesn't let emotions
or personal issues
get in the way of victory.

615
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:32,929
And I've made a commitment
to this team.

616
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:36,626
They don't want you here
either, Gary.
Yeah. Sure, they don't.

617
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,464
They don't.
They're my friends.

618
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:42,233
But you're not
a strong bowler.
That's not the point.

619
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,707
You know what? Let's just...
Why don't we let them decide?

620
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:49,405
Gary, don't. No.
Don't involve them, okay?
That's unnecessary.

621
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,243
What's wrong, Castro?
Castro?

622
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,078
Well, Castro doesn't
let people vote as a team.

623
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,278
Okay. Ask them.
Thank you.

624
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:58,013
Okay, everyone.
Team vote here.

625
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:01,589
By a show of hands,
just put it up when you
make a decision,

626
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:05,759
who here agrees with Brooke
and thinks I should leave
the bowling team?

627
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:09,360
Shocker.

628
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:30,815
<i>Band of Brothers.
You should rent it sometime.</i>

629
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:37,191
Good luck, everyone.
Riding Miss Gutter Ball
to the finals.

630
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:41,662
Hey, Gary.
Yeah.

631
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:46,535
I'm gonna need
your shirt back.
What?

632
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:50,403
Well, we're gonna have to
replace you, and you know
we get docked 10 pins

633
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:53,341
if everyone's not in matching
Pin Shakers uniforms.

634
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,305
My shirt says "Gary" on it.
Granted.

635
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,679
But actually,
we know a guy named Gary.

636
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:04,049
And he's not as tall as you,
but he's a pretty good bowler.

637
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:16,732
I'm gonna have to request
that I have my wrist guard
back then.

638
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:19,927
I'm sorry. That's mine.

639
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:27,267
Just give me
the goddamn wrist guard,
please. Thank you.

640
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:29,313
I hope your wrist snaps.

641
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:37,513
Wow. Okay? You see that?
You know what I mean?

642
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,146
Yeah. That was awesome.

643
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:41,885
You just had your
ex-boyfriend, who you wish
you were still dating,

644
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:43,984
voted off the bowling team.

645
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,359
Well, I had to do that
to get him right
where I want him.

646
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,227
Where's that?
Shirtless in the parking lot?

647
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:50,665
Addie,
you're not getting this.

648
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:54,335
Gary loves this bowling team.
He's hurt right now.

649
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:56,032
He's feeling pretty bad.

650
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,803
He's gonna go out there
and he's gonna get drunk.

651
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:01,470
He's gonna make
a complete fool of himself.

652
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:04,013
And he will be sitting there
feeling pretty lonely

653
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:07,380
and pretty pathetic,
and then it's just
gonna hit him.

654
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:09,983
What's gonna hit him?

655
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:12,413
That not only is he
out a girlfriend,

656
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,357
but his life is just
falling apart piece by piece

657
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:17,291
and maybe that life
was pretty great.

658
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:20,159
And maybe I was the glue
that was holding it all
together.

659
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,789
And if he wants
that life back,

660
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:24,596
he's gonna have no choice
but to change.

661
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:29,732
How about this?
I feel like we just found hell.

662
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,798
When did you start
coming to knobby joints
like this?

663
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:33,935
I might be the greatest
you've ever seen, pal.

664
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:36,445
I'm conquering new frontiers.
Hello, babe.

665
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:39,005
Yeah, you've got to put up
with the bad music
and the $15 drinks,

666
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:42,211
but this place is stacked
with top-shelf, young,
dumb ass.

667
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:44,584
All you gotta do is just
separate the weaker ones
from the herd.

668
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:45,849
Come on,
I'll get you into the VIP.

669
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:47,686
Can I get a couple drinks
from you?
Okay, L.G.

670
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:49,885
Lupus, I got to be totally...
I got to be honest with you.

671
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,120
I'm not feeling it here.

672
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:52,594
You're gonna like it in here.
You're gonna love it.

673
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,756
I don't like it out here.
Look, listen to me,
will you, please?

674
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:55,958
How you doing, Buzz?

675
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:58,228
While you were
on the inside locked up
for the past two years,

676
00:38:58,302 --> 00:38:59,599
the game has changed.

677
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:06,233
Do you remember
when you were an outdoor cat

678
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,774
and you used to have to hunt
and kill for your food?

679
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,279
Well, you've become
an indoor cat.

680
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,906
You've been getting your milk
brought to you

681
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,040
in a silver bowl,
and guess what?

682
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:14,744
Now, you've been
tossed back outside

683
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:18,016
and the alley has changed.
For example,
your MTV generation,

684
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:21,024
your technology,
your text message,
your TiVo. You name it.

685
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:23,287
People want their
information faster.

686
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:26,353
People e-mail each other
because they want to
exchange information, Gar.

687
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:29,024
They don't want to connect,
they want results.

688
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,795
Okay.
You gotta get to
the message quicker.

689
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,667
Now, I want you to watch.
It's real simple. Okay?

690
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:38,338
How you doing, ladies?

691
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:39,501
Now, here's what I'd like
to do to you.

692
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:41,977
First, I'd like to
get you naked.

693
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,673
And then I'm gonna take
some Saran Wrap

694
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,477
and I'm gonna wrap you
up in it, head to toe.

695
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,641
Then I'm gonna
cut out two holes.

696
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,582
One for your mouth,
so you can breathe,
obviously.

697
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:49,778
And the other one...
Asshole.

698
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:51,515
It could be a gorgeous
evening for us, babe.

699
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:52,851
The pink is gorgeous.
Jesus, God.

700
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:54,857
Come here.
Lupus, listen to me.
I want you to listen to me.

701
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:56,222
There are our drinks.
You want your drink?

702
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:58,420
No, I'm fine.
Thank you.
The L.G. Thanks you.

703
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:01,522
Will you listen to me,
please? You're my brother
and I love you very much,

704
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,090
and maybe you do
get laid tonight,
but maybe you get arrested.

705
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:06,295
Arrested for what, babe?
Being awesome?

706
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,999
Come on, babe, listen.
You want to tell your jokes,
tell your jokes.

707
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:13,874
But sooner or later
you're gonna get hungry
and you're gonna wanna eat.

708
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:17,637
And jokes might
make you feel better,
but they don't get you fed.

709
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,513
I'm gonna go take a lap.

710
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,297
What are you doing?
I'm sketching.

711
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,700
And where are you sketching?

712
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,229
In the living room.
No, in my bedroom.

713
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:41,896
And I didn't say anything
to you, Brooke,

714
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:44,270
when you so arrogantly
claimed the bed
without asking me,

715
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:47,708
but you can't just waltz
into my room and turn it
into a damn art fair.

716
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,110
Gary, I've only taken up
a little bit of space, so...

717
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:52,149
I don't care if you only
took an inch.

718
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:55,708
There might not be
a door here, but this
is my domain. Okay?

719
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,118
I don't go into your bedroom
and set up a goddamn sawhorse.

720
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:00,885
Well, then what the hell
is that pool table
doing in the dining room?

721
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,426
Because that's a common area.
And that's where this belongs.

722
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:04,961
Not in my room.
Hey, what are you doing?

723
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:06,724
It belongs in another
common area.
Gary.

724
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,265
People want to come home
and they want to relax
in their room.

725
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:12,097
Gary, it is 2:00
in the morning!

726
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:14,729
Don't you drop my things.
I don't know
what to tell you, kid.

727
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:15,829
This is how I am
when I'm single.

728
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:17,965
My hours start to get
pretty strange.

729
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:19,976
Might be time for you
to think about moving out.

730
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:22,069
Why would I...
No, I'm not moving anywhere.

731
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,205
Gary, just please
turn the volume down.

732
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:26,476
Yeah, but I don't tell you
what the hell to do
in your room.

733
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,074
You can doodle. You can dance.

734
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,551
You can bake
a goddamn gingerbread house.

735
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,644
I don't give a shit.

736
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:33,485
But in my room,
I want to relax
and watch my highlights

737
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:36,151
in complete surround-sound
experience.

738
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:39,685
What the hell are you doing?
You're not even gonna
watch it!

739
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:41,355
Don't tell me what I am
or aren't not doing.

740
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:43,024
Oh, what you are not,
not doing?

741
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,364
Go learn some English.
Oh, I'm sorry.

742
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:48,928
I didn't have a grandfather
on the board of
some fancy college.

743
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,736
Key word being "was.' '
Did he touch the Filipino
exchange student?

744
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:53,071
Did he not touch
the exchange student?

745
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:54,701
I don't know, Brooke.
I wasn't there.
Okay.

746
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:56,075
No, don't start
with the family stuff.

747
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:58,171
Like your family's so perfect?
Your brother's a pervert!

748
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:00,717
Don't talk to me about
the sexual habits
of family members.

749
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:02,411
What about your sister?

750
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,517
My sister's
been through a lot.
Of dick.

751
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:10,116
There are some problems, Gary,
but can we please
just leave it...

752
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:14,255
Problems? She slept with
the entire Arizona Cardinals
offensive line.

753
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:17,025
That's not problems.
That's she's the problem!

754
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:20,070
She was on vacation!
She was on vacation.

755
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:22,998
Don't even get me started,
by the way, on your brother.

756
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:25,507
If I have to hear
that guy sing
just one more time,

757
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:27,737
I'd hang myself
with wax dental floss.

758
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:30,575
Could the guy just
come out of the closet,
please?

759
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:32,946
Richard is not gay.

760
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:38,746
Okay, lassie,
I want you to listen to me
and listen good.

761
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:40,084
I'm not saying
he won't get married.

762
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:42,387
I'm not saying
he won't even have kids.

763
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:43,756
But then one day
his wife will come home,

764
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:45,886
and then she'll find him
with a guy named Majulio,

765
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:48,659
wearing leather helmets
and clubbing each other
to Yanni's greatest hits.

766
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,324
Yeah. Right. Whatever.
You're an infant.

767
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,925
Yeah, I'm an infant.

768
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:54,436
Go enjoy your room, Brooke,
'cause I'm gonna enjoy mine!

769
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:55,699
Okay.
You know what?

770
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:57,798
I might enjoy
some pay-per-view
options tonight.

771
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:59,137
It's gonna be a long one,
sweetheart,

772
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:01,200
<i>and I got nothing to do manana
but sleep in.</i>

773
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:53,624
<i>Boogie nights
Ain't no doubt
we are here to party</i>

774
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:54,959
What are you doing?

775
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:56,829
<i>Boogie nights
Come on now,
got to get it started</i>

776
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,265
Ricky, you and
the Get Along Gang leave

777
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,269
or I'm gonna
throw you out of here
personally, you understand?

778
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:02,066
Actually, Gary,
this is Brooke's bedroom.

779
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,699
So, technically,
you don't have
jurisdiction here,

780
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:07,710
but I think it'd be really fun
if you sang with us.

781
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:09,473
Come on, Gary.
I think you'll like it.

782
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:10,911
You got 10 seconds
to get out of here

783
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,448
or I'm gonna break
your damn magic whistle.

784
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:14,484
You understand
what I'm saying to you?

785
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:16,678
Move this group
out of my house, now!

786
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:26,057
Gary, you can't take
a pitch pipe
out of a guy's hand

787
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,758
when he's in the middle
of a very funky groove.

788
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,493
You can get hurt
doing something like that.

789
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:32,228
I'm tapping out,
I'm tapping out!

790
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:33,929
Here we go. From the bridge.

791
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:38,771
<i>Party night
Get on down
with the sound of the music</i>

792
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:41,538
<i>Boogie nights
Do it, do it</i>

793
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:53,779
What kind of bullshit move
was that?

794
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:57,258
I'm sorry. What?
What happened?
Oh, don't be coy with me.

795
00:44:57,327 --> 00:45:01,286
You sent that animal over here
to attack me when I was
hung over and weak.

796
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:05,330
Oh, no. Look, all I know
is The Tone Rangers,

797
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:06,801
they needed someplace
to rehearse,

798
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:10,328
so I very clearly
told Richard,
"Stay in my room,"

799
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:14,101
which you explained to me
was my space to do
with what I want.

800
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:16,913
Is that how
you want to play it?
'Cause I'll play it like that.

801
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,106
I'll play it like
Lionel Richie.

802
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:20,810
All night long, lady.
Oh, yeah.

803
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:22,715
I'll call some guys
from my neck of the woods.

804
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:23,912
And we're not talking, Brooke,

805
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:26,251
about a couple of queens
who know a few grapples.

806
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:29,656
We're talking about Polacks
that don't have
a goddamn future.

807
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,989
Right.
That's right!

808
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,926
We can make shit
real uncomfortable
around here,

809
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:34,156
and that's what
we're gonna do.

810
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,630
Please. Come on.
You know what?

811
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:38,759
You're just embarrassed
because Richard
kicked your ass.

812
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:44,402
Richard did not kick my ass.

813
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:48,238
What Richard did was attack me
when I was half asleep.

814
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:50,212
Really?
Is that how you see it?

815
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,511
There's a really big gap
between getting
your ass kicked

816
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:57,452
and having
a dancing, singing sprite
fool you with trickery

817
00:45:57,521 --> 00:46:00,957
and then strike your throat
before you know that
you're even in a fight.

818
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:03,151
And I wouldn't expect
someone like you
to understand that,

819
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:07,254
because all you ever do
is make moves from
up in your ivy tower.

820
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:11,331
Wow. You have officially
gone off the reservation.

821
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:14,393
I'm an adult.
I talk through shit.
He ran out of ideas.

822
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:18,597
God. Listen, by the way,
there's messages
on the voice mail

823
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:20,939
regarding game night,
which is obviously
not gonna happen,

824
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:24,503
so you might want to
call people and tell them
that it's canceled.

825
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:26,378
Why would I cancel game night?
Well, I mean...

826
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,748
If it's our turn to host game,
I'm gonna host
goddamn game night.

827
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:30,514
You want to host game night?
I'm fine, Brooke.

828
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:33,715
I don't have any strangeness
over what happened here today.

829
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:34,780
Okay.

830
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:37,486
If there's anyone
that should feel weird
about seeing people,

831
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:40,359
that's you, Tonya Harding.
Me? I'm gonna honor
my commitments.

832
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:41,795
Great.
Great.

833
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:42,991
Fine.
Fine.

834
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:44,897
Let's do that.
Let's do that.

835
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:47,060
Let's honor the commitment.

836
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,041
Hey, there's no food in there!
So?

837
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:55,476
Well, people are gonna
be here in an hour.
What are they supposed to eat?

838
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:57,537
You're a big boy.
Figure it out.

839
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,422
Oh, great.
Well, that's what we got.

840
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:14,355
We have only tap water
because, you know,
Gary didn't shop.

841
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:18,367
And we don't have
any ice either 'cause
he didn't fill the trays.

842
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,762
That's trash. It's your shot.
What is your name again?

843
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:21,930
Diane.
Diane.

844
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,097
Did you call?
I called the five.

845
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,765
Well, yeah,
but you didn't call
the second ball,

846
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:25,934
so that's trash,
so it's your shot.

847
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,943
You got to play
by the rules. It's your shot.

848
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,035
Hi.
Hi.

849
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,374
Andrew.
Oh, hi.

850
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:33,950
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, hey!

851
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:36,645
These two Benedict Arnolds
aren't welcome in my condo.

852
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,915
Who sent an invite to them?
I'm sorry.

853
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:42,925
These are very loyal friends
and they are always welcome
in my condo.

854
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:46,156
Oh, really? Why don't we
take it to a vote and see
who has the numbers this time?

855
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,561
All right.
Show of hands here.

856
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:51,499
Who thinks that these two
traitors should leave and
not be a part of game night?

857
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:53,661
And maybe take their shirts
off when they leave.

858
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:56,934
Raise your hand.
I know I feel that way.
Who else?

859
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,099
Come on, Johnny O,
put your hand up, please.

860
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:01,940
Come on. Thank you.
You, Miss? New girl.

861
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:05,143
Who's the girl?
What's her name?
What's her name?

862
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,877
The girl you're with.
What's her name?
Her name's Diane.

863
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:10,943
Oh, I'm sorry.
You might want to go ahead
and touch some sky.

864
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:13,888
Thank you. Come on,
Riggleman, please?
What are you doing?

865
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:16,187
No. We need the eight
to count towards
a running tally.

866
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,352
You know that. Come on.

867
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:19,486
Show her whose side
that you're on.
Put your hand in the air.

868
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,464
You know whose side I'm on.
You know we need eight,
though. Come on.

869
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:24,261
Put your hand down.

870
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:30,370
Please don't touch
my Ruffles.

871
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,702
Put that one back.
Those are my Ruffles.

872
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:33,140
Don't eat them, please.
Thank you.

873
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:34,700
Oh, Gary.
They're mine.

874
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:36,006
Come on.
Here we go. All right.

875
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,843
Eyes front. Ready?
Hold on. Get the
timer going, please.

876
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,009
Ready?
Now I gotta do it. Go.

877
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,676
Okay.
It's a brick.

878
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,550
Square. Square.
Box. Box.

879
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:47,112
Corner. Corner.
A dot in the corner.

880
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:48,748
A house.
Home plate!

881
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:52,090
Football! Baseball!
Sports. A house.
A triangle.
It's algebra.

882
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:54,096
Okay, it's a house.
It's a house.

883
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:55,563
It's a house.
Two words.

884
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:57,190
Banana?
Chimney,
chimney, chimney!

885
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,997
A fruit. House. Fruit.

886
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,594
Oh, restaurant. Or...

887
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:03,037
No, chimney, chimney.
Smoke...

888
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,199
Oh, a house call.
House call!

889
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,674
Oh! House call!

890
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:08,506
Yeah, well, I thought
it was a house call.

891
00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:10,569
Like a hotel, then it hit me
it was a house.
Yeah!

892
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:12,615
You're terrific.
Absolutely terrific.

893
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:13,741
All right, beat that.

894
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:15,011
Okay, guys, listen.
The next one wins, okay?

895
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:16,712
So let's stay focused.
Let's stay calm.

896
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,812
We can do this. High fives.
Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

897
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:21,084
Let's get a mind-meld.
Let's try and get a mind-meld,
okay?

898
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:22,591
Here we go.
Let's go. Mind-meld.
I heard you!

899
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:24,126
Don't over-think it.
Mind meld.
Ready?

900
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:25,957
I heard you!
Well, just keep it simple.

901
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:27,121
Shush.

902
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:29,665
Ready? Wait. Go!
Here we go!
We're mind-melding.

903
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:31,394
Draw faster.
It doesn't have
to be beautiful,

904
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:32,833
just has to be
something we can get.
Shoe, shoe...

905
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:34,632
Shoe! Shoe, shoe, shoe.

906
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:37,337
Shoeless Joe Jackson.
Draw something different.
No one's getting it.

907
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:39,068
Shoe. What, is that
a smaller shoe?
Baby shoe.

908
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,167
Smaller shoe. Baby shoes.
Shoes.

909
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:42,836
Baby shoes.
Smaller shoe. Gumshoe.

910
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:44,073
Smaller shoes.
Gumshoe? Gumshoe?

911
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,672
Running Olympics.
Inside the shoe.

912
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:49,546
Inside a shoe. A bubble...
Lining.

913
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:51,814
Stop pointing at the shoe.
We're not...
No one's guessing shoe.

914
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:53,446
Stop pointing at the shoe
and draw something different.

915
00:49:53,523 --> 00:49:54,547
Draw something different.
You...

916
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:57,115
Goddamn it!
No one's guessing shoe!

917
00:49:57,194 --> 00:50:00,322
You drew a big shoe,
then a small shoe,
and no one got it.

918
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:03,662
You gotta draw something
different. Everyone said
"shoe" seven times.

919
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,497
It's a sock, asshole.

920
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:07,897
You call yourself an artist?
Yes!

921
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:10,599
A three-year-old with
a box of crayons could
do a better job than this.

922
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:13,404
I'm sorry, I don't have
the great talent of standing
on top of a big red bus

923
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:15,672
and pointing out architecture
that other great men
have built!

924
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:16,974
I'm the one who should
be sorry, Brooke.

925
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:18,776
I shouldn't sit here
and pick on your art.
No.

926
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,942
Because you got
the nuts part down,
Picasso.

927
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,610
All you have
to do is
cut off your frigging ear.

928
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:23,846
That's Van Gogh,
you idiot!

929
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,854
And your insults
are much more effective
when they're accurate.

930
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:27,048
Don't talk to me about
being goddamn accurate!

931
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:28,250
I can talk to you
about anything that I want.

932
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:29,587
'Cause you couldn't even
draw a sock.

933
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:30,751
You don't do anything right!
You're a lazy...

934
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:32,055
Everyone said,
"Shoe, shoe, shoe!"

935
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:36,665
At first,
I figured that the split
was just something temporary,

936
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:39,827
something that you two
would work out and get past,

937
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:41,495
but after tonight
I think it's pretty clear

938
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:44,631
that you two genuinely
do not want to
get back together.

939
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:46,606
There's not a shot in hell.
Gary.

940
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:48,337
I'm just...
I got you.

941
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:51,675
As your friend
and as your realtor,

942
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:52,908
I'm not gonna
leave here tonight

943
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:54,610
until we decide
what to do about this condo,

944
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:59,018
because this living situation
is obviously not working out.

945
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:03,419
Gary?

946
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:10,462
Well, the only logical thing
that I can think of

947
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:14,003
is for her to move out
of the condo,

948
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:17,837
and then to pay me some
sort of a penalty
as compensation for

949
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,138
the labor that I did
all around the condo.
What? What?

950
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:23,270
What? Pay you compensation
for your labor?

951
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:26,480
We fixed this place up
together.
Are you nuts?

952
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,211
Stop calling me nuts,
I swear to God.
I fixed the...

953
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:29,411
You went around with a sponge,

954
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:30,976
and you went in the bathroom
and you dotted foofy shit.

955
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:32,612
That's what you're saying
that I did?
There's no...

956
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:34,213
That was...
That's called aesthetics.

957
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:36,316
It warmed this place up
so it didn't look like

958
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:38,623
an army barracks,
which it was about to.

959
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:40,629
I'll tell you what
it's called in his language,
depreciated.

960
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:42,688
That's what it's called.
You don't even know
what that means.

961
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:45,132
Unless the next buyer
happens to have your same
Zulu-voodoo-land taste.

962
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:46,499
All right.
Let me tell you
something else.

963
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:48,970
It's gonna cost money
to cover up the holes
in the wall.

964
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:52,440
The holes that you drilled
in the wall there to hang up
whatever that thing is called.

965
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:53,567
Oh, please. Gary.

966
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:54,632
You're gonna have
to cost money to fix that.

967
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:57,271
What I did, Brooke,
has concrete value
to the condo.

968
00:51:57,347 --> 00:51:59,178
I added concrete...
Well, let's just go on record.

969
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:02,082
We're dealing with facts here.
I did the tiling
in the bathroom.

970
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:03,881
Have you seen...
I did the new track lighting.

971
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,785
That tile is the
shittiest tile job.
I did the plumbing!

972
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:07,289
The plumbing!
That's realty terms.

973
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:09,120
Okay. Let's talk
about your plumbing.
This is his plumbing.

974
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:10,352
We have two temperatures
in our bathroom.

975
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:13,157
We get either scalding hot
or we get frostbite.

976
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:14,720
That's it. That's all we get.
It's my problem

977
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,163
that she doesn't know how
to pace a shower?

978
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:17,222
Now all of a sudden
that's my fault.

979
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,358
I get a minute
to take a shower.

980
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:19,663
One minute?
One minute of warmth?

981
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:21,863
Oh, Jesus. One minute.
That's it. That's correct.

982
00:52:21,938 --> 00:52:24,668
Thank God you're not
in charge of keeping all the
clocks in Chicago on time.

983
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:27,209
This is basic logic.
You are out of your mind.
You have lost it.

984
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:29,074
Let me explain this to you
in plain chapter and verse.

985
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:33,207
Cheese and rice,
you guys are gonna kill
each other. Now, let's just...

986
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:35,808
Realistically speaking,
neither one of you

987
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:38,013
can afford this mortgage
on your own, okay?

988
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:41,717
And that's a shame,
because this building will
continue to increase in value.

989
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:44,055
I get nothing but
phone calls about it,
all right?

990
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:45,719
Waiting for a unit to open up.

991
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:49,492
So, as your realtor,
the last thing I would suggest
is selling.

992
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:53,093
But as your friend,
I just, I don't see
any other solution.

993
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,301
You take your halves,
you go your separate ways,

994
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:57,363
and you get on
with your lives.

995
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:03,875
I know that selling is not
the easiest thing, but
I do think that it's the best.

996
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:08,079
And to be honest,
this is a situation

997
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:11,416
where I would just as soon
not take a commission.

998
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:18,155
That's great. Thank you.
That's great.
Thank you for that.

999
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:20,025
I wish I didn't have to,
you know,

1000
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:22,963
but company policy says
I cannot waive that.

1001
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:25,894
But I was just...
You know, I'm saying
in theory, you know.

1002
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:30,338
In this situation,
'cause we're friends,
I wish I could waive it.

1003
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,839
No can do, though.

1004
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:36,169
As soon as you can,
I would love to get
a set of keys from you guys.

1005
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:39,147
You just drop them off.
Okay. Great. There they are.

1006
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,343
I'll be bringing by
people all week.

1007
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:45,479
You won't even know I'm here.
The good news is,
should move quickly.

1008
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:47,116
All right.

1009
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,216
Okay to leave you two
alone now?

1010
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:53,951
Got to get back to Jen.
Very excited about
the win tonight.

1011
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:56,257
Okay.

1012
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:13,506
Addie,
if the condo sells,
I think I'm gonna lose him.

1013
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,278
<i>Yeah, but game night
was so light and fun,</i>

1014
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:17,411
<i>I'm really surprised
to be hearing this.</i>

1015
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:19,785
Okay. You know what?
That's not constructive.
Really.

1016
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:22,222
I just... Yeah, I need
a new plan, Addie. I don't...

1017
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:26,625
I'm just kidding. It's me.

1018
00:54:26,696 --> 00:54:28,857
I'm gonna have to
call you back.

1019
00:54:30,066 --> 00:54:33,229
Whenever one of my friends
is down, we all go on,
like, happy patrol.

1020
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:35,533
I was actually having
a very serious conversation.

1021
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:36,936
Christopher, do not sing.

1022
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:40,602
<i>If you're happy
and you know it
Clap your hands</i>

1023
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:45,078
<i>If you're happy
and you know it
Clap your hands</i>

1024
00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:47,912
<i>If you're happy
and you know it
You're going to smile to...</i>

1025
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:53,182
Pack up your shit and go home.

1026
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:56,782
Okay. You know what?
This is not his fault.

1027
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:59,727
He was just really trying
to cheer me up and it...

1028
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:08,361
Did I or did I not give you
the day off to be sad?

1029
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:10,998
Yes. But I...
Well, today's not that day,

1030
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:14,201
and unfortunately for you,
I can't afford to look weak.

1031
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:15,403
No, please.

1032
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:19,378
You have warned me
so many times
and you have yet to fire me.

1033
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:23,416
I think you and I both know
that to find and train
somebody new,

1034
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:26,250
it's gonna cost you time,
and it's gonna cost you money,

1035
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:29,451
and I don't think you want
to spend either one of those.

1036
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:33,624
Now, look, I'm just gonna
take a wild guess here,

1037
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:36,962
but you don't become
Marilyn Dean

1038
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:40,061
without knowing
how to handle men.

1039
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:44,368
Okay? Now, just listen
to my problem,

1040
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:48,104
tell me how to fix it,
and then we'll all
go back to work.

1041
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:54,039
Okay. What is this problem
so severe

1042
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:58,747
that has caused you to
blaspheme in the synagogue
of Marilyn Dean?

1043
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:03,452
Well, it's Gary.
I broke up with him

1044
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:08,957
in hopes that losing me
would make him
want to change,

1045
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,091
and that's, you know...

1046
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:15,504
And I've just ended up
pushing him, you know,
farther and farther away.

1047
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:20,000
That's it?
Yeah.

1048
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:25,814
Honey, this is not
surrealism or cubism,
it's paint-by-numbers.

1049
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:31,720
Go see Mischa,
my personal waxer at the spa.

1050
00:56:31,921 --> 00:56:34,446
Ask her for the Telly Savalas.

1051
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:37,590
The Telly Savalas.

1052
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:39,991
Compliments of M. Dean.

1053
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:44,928
Then go show Gary
your immaculate canvas

1054
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:48,835
and let him see another man
eager to paint it. Got it?

1055
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:51,535
Got it?

1056
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:12,121
Who loves you, baby?

1057
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:16,655
<i>Wow, impressive.
Three sharp hands landed.</i>

1058
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:19,896
<i>What an amazing display
of punching technique.</i>

1059
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:22,631
<i>The crowd jumps.
That punch rocked him.</i>

1060
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:25,173
<i>They sense he's on the verge
of hitting the canvas.</i>

1061
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:28,267
<i>The roaring for anticipation
of a knockout.</i>

1062
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:31,040
<i>We are witnessing
a great fight.</i>

1063
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:34,515
<i>He's displaying incredible
rhythm with his hands.</i>

1064
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:39,952
<i>Bulldog terrorizing
his opponent. Down he goes!</i>

1065
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:42,548
<i>Hard punch slams him
to the canvas.</i>

1066
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:52,026
<i>One, two, three,</i>

1067
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:56,765
<i>four, five, six, seven, eight,</i>

1068
00:57:57,373 --> 00:58:00,308
<i>Nine, ten. It's over.</i>

1069
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:15,857
Is... Did... Is Brooke here?

1070
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:18,521
I don't know.

1071
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:30,170
Brooke?
I'll be right there.

1072
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:42,576
<i>Cool, baby, cool.</i>

1073
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:53,561
So, how do you and Brooke
know each other?

1074
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:56,793
Well, how don't we
know each other,
you know what I mean?

1075
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:01,497
Hi, Paul.
You look great.

1076
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:02,560
Thank you.

1077
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:06,040
Are you ready to go?
Yeah. All set.

1078
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:10,272
So, it was great meeting you.
Apple martinis.

1079
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:12,405
All right, come on.
That normally does the trick.

1080
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:14,746
Just ignore him.
But just two.
Three, she'll get sloppy.

1081
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:16,011
You'll become a babysitter.

1082
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:19,213
Oh, and fantasy role playing.
She's got a real thing
for lifeguards.

1083
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:22,349
Put some zinc oxide
on your nose
and she'll lose her mind.

1084
00:59:22,425 --> 00:59:23,517
It'll all be over with.

1085
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:29,023
<i>Y'all want me
to stop running?</i>

1086
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:01,822
I mean, the most challenging
part of what I do

1087
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:04,992
is between February
and April 15th.

1088
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:08,435
That's what we in the biz
like to call crunch time.

1089
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:11,264
That sounds fascinating.

1090
01:00:11,341 --> 01:00:12,933
Good evening.
Hi.

1091
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:14,738
Can I start you two off
with something to drink?

1092
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:19,077
Yeah, you know, we're gonna
start with a couple
of apple martinis, please.

1093
01:00:19,649 --> 01:00:23,676
No, you know what?
I'm gonna... I'm just
gonna start with a water.

1094
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:26,153
Well, you can just
bring those, just in case.
What was I saying?

1095
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:27,416
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1096
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:30,482
So, you know,
it's not like it's
all work and no play.

1097
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:34,296
You know, I mean,
after April 15th,
that's what we in the biz

1098
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:36,525
like to call party time.

1099
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:38,926
Excuse me.

1100
01:00:41,004 --> 01:00:43,598
Oh, I have to get this.
I'm so sorry.

1101
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:44,731
Hello.

1102
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:47,241
<i>Okay, is this when
I'm supposed to call?
What?</i>

1103
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,778
What do you mean? What?
Where? What happened?

1104
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:53,407
<i>Okay, that's great.
Wait. What? Oh, all right.</i>

1105
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,781
Listen, where...
Just don't move.
Where are you?

1106
01:00:55,852 --> 01:00:57,877
<i>I'm sitting in my kitchen.
Sitting? Okay.</i>

1107
01:00:57,954 --> 01:00:59,922
Don't move.

1108
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:03,925
Don't... I'm gonna be
right there, honey. I'm gonna
be right there, okay?

1109
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:05,790
Is everything okay?
Oh, my gosh.

1110
01:01:05,862 --> 01:01:07,329
That was my best friend.

1111
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:11,231
She just had an accident
and she...
She has this knee thing

1112
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,269
and she's just very fragile,
and I have to go.
What?

1113
01:01:14,404 --> 01:01:16,804
I can give you a ride.
No. No. That's okay.

1114
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:19,603
I'm gonna grab a cab, so...
I'm so sorry.

1115
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,200
I like your dress.

1116
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:26,005
I think he's fascinating.
He's obviously
read a lot of books.

1117
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:27,709
Yeah. Yeah, I bet he has.

1118
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:31,083
He reads a lot of books
because nobody
wants to talk to him.

1119
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:34,845
He's a friend of Andrew's
who's always been polite.

1120
01:01:34,924 --> 01:01:37,324
It's the best I could do
on such short notice, okay?

1121
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:39,452
Well, you know what?
Polite is not gonna do it.

1122
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:43,522
We've got to find somebody
who is really gonna
make Gary jealous.

1123
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:45,759
Can I just say something?

1124
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:47,234
You sound a little jealous,
Gary.

1125
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:49,203
Why would I be
jealous of some guy
with computer skills?

1126
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:52,833
Let's say he doesn't have
computer skills, but he's got
a big old elephant hog on him?

1127
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:54,638
Would that bother you
or would you be
okay with that?

1128
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,110
Not nearly as much as the way
that your mind works.

1129
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:57,476
My mind works great.

1130
01:01:57,547 --> 01:02:00,812
So, what's this bullshit
I hear about you
selling the condo?

1131
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:02,974
Selling that condo
is ludicrous.

1132
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:04,610
I was waiting for
when I was gonna get

1133
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:07,281
the how-Gary-always-
screws-his-life-up
speech again.

1134
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:08,983
This must be the right time.
Look, you tell me,

1135
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,117
you just tell me, tell me.
Is it happening now?
Yeah. Okay.

1136
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:13,788
Tell me how
losing that asset

1137
01:02:13,863 --> 01:02:16,957
is gonna get us
on the river?

1138
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:20,730
Go ahead, just tell me.
Tell me. Somebody tell me.
What is this?

1139
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:24,203
What is this? What is it?
What is it? Hey!
Don't patronize me.

1140
01:02:24,273 --> 01:02:26,264
Helicopters.
Helicopters. Exactly!

1141
01:02:26,342 --> 01:02:28,310
How does losing the asset
give us helicopters?

1142
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:32,108
Dennis, I'm being totally
serious with you. I don't
need this shit right now.

1143
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:34,274
Hey, you want to cry,
cry to Mom.

1144
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:36,985
Nobody's crying.
I'm not crying.

1145
01:02:37,053 --> 01:02:39,817
I just don't feel
like hearing it.
There's no feelings here.

1146
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:43,586
This is about money
and business.
Fine, you broke up.

1147
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:48,191
You broke up. Fine.

1148
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,256
You know, sad.

1149
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:56,962
Sad is, instead of putting
$1,000 into your mortgage
every month,

1150
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:00,008
you waste it on rent.
That's what sad is.

1151
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:04,906
Oh, you're broke up.
You're confused,
brokenhearted.

1152
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:08,309
Heartbreak is not
having that money

1153
01:03:08,384 --> 01:03:12,081
as part of your net worth
and then not saving the money,

1154
01:03:12,388 --> 01:03:15,221
so that after taxes
you can invest!

1155
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:20,491
You know, you're confused.

1156
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:25,859
Are you finished?
Look, I need
the damn tour logs.

1157
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:28,926
Yeah.

1158
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:32,333
Well, I really,
really appreciate
the heart to heart.

1159
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:34,774
It was a great talk, Dennis.
Thank you.

1160
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:38,004
Oh, well, you're behind
three months. You're still
behind three months.

1161
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:41,174
And those logs are imperative
to insuring that our books
are straight!

1162
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,878
I'll tell you what those
logs are. Those logs are
bullshit is what they are!

1163
01:03:43,953 --> 01:03:45,853
You got the receipts.
Tally the goddamn
things yourself!

1164
01:03:45,922 --> 01:03:47,048
I do, I do!

1165
01:03:47,123 --> 01:03:50,559
And I don't appreciate it,
because it cuts into
my time with my family.

1166
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:53,595
I could be spending that time
with my family instead of
doing your books.

1167
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,858
I already do the taxes.
I do the billing.

1168
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:59,163
I do the hiring, the firing.
I do the maintenance.

1169
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:02,261
Come on, what do you do?
What is it that you do?

1170
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:05,136
You do the tours!
I am the talent, Dennis!

1171
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:08,066
They sign up a month
in advance to see me.

1172
01:04:08,211 --> 01:04:12,511
They'll wait in line
for the next bus
to see me! All right?

1173
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:18,410
So don't drain me
with all this bullshit
about the goddamn tour logs!

1174
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:34,392
<i>How big's your TV?
Oh, shut up!</i>

1175
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:36,836
How big's your TV,
'cause I wanna know if you
can see what's happening.

1176
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:38,601
<i>Oh, wow.
You beat a 12-year-old.</i>

1177
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:41,507
I don't care if you're
12 years old. You have
more time in the day to play.

1178
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:42,908
I live in the real world,
my man,

1179
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:45,812
With bills
and responsibilities.

1180
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:47,482
That's right.

1181
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:51,008
You can't have a handle
called Mad Dog Killer
if you complain every time...

1182
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:53,146
Brooke?
Hi, Mike.

1183
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:55,019
Hi.
Come on in.

1184
01:04:55,091 --> 01:04:56,285
<i>Hold on, Mom. I'm coming.</i>

1185
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:57,348
Is your mom
in the room with you?

1186
01:04:57,426 --> 01:04:59,656
'Cause I hope she can't see
what's happening.

1187
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,321
I hope she can't see
what's happening.

1188
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:04,332
I'm gonna be just
a few more seconds.
So, just sit down and relax.

1189
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,265
Oh, yeah, no problem.

1190
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:08,633
I'm sorry?
Yeah, why'd you do that?

1191
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:12,504
You take the fun
out of beating you, because
you have an excuse to lose.

1192
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:13,667
<i>Get a life, dude.</i>

1193
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:16,211
Do you think it's possible
that your mom won't
love you anymore

1194
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:18,008
if she sees how bad
you're losing in the game.

1195
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,172
<i>Shut up!</i>

1196
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:45,362
Okay.

1197
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:47,970
All right.

1198
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:51,972
That's great. You're gonna
stay man-to-man with me.

1199
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:53,413
What happens
when I make a play?

1200
01:05:53,482 --> 01:05:56,315
Making plays, making plays!
Making plays!

1201
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:58,717
Well, you know,
that's how my people
like to handle their business.

1202
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:01,279
While your guys
are out partying,
mine are running routes.

1203
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:02,756
Try to make a difference.

1204
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:05,259
Mike? I'm ready to go.

1205
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:08,653
Oh, hey,

1206
01:06:10,266 --> 01:06:14,134
do you mind if we finish
the game? We got
a real nail-biter going here.

1207
01:06:18,874 --> 01:06:21,570
Yeah, sure. Of course. Great.

1208
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:24,472
Awesome, all right?

1209
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:31,078
Touchdown.
Oh, God, is that pretty.

1210
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:34,517
God, is that pretty.
Yeah, I'm a gentleman.

1211
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:38,056
I like to be humble.
I'm old school.
I don't like to talk a lot.

1212
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:41,528
But at the same time,
am I talented?

1213
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:43,989
Tell me how you felt about
what just happened there.

1214
01:06:44,066 --> 01:06:46,034
That's him going deep.
That's him going...

1215
01:06:46,102 --> 01:06:48,866
Work ethic. Work ethic.

1216
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,774
I could play this game
forever.

1217
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,969
Oh, I could, too.
I love it, yeah.
I love it, don't you?

1218
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:56,409
I mean, it's the kind of thing
where literally

1219
01:06:56,479 --> 01:06:59,209
I play the game and it's like,
four hours go by.

1220
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:03,980
Fate has me highly skilled
and loaded with talent.

1221
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:05,479
Oh...

1222
01:07:05,554 --> 01:07:08,216
'Cause I think I'm
good enough to figure out
how to beat myself.

1223
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:09,348
You push yourself.

1224
01:07:09,425 --> 01:07:11,393
You push yourself
trying to achieve
the impossible,

1225
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:13,724
because you know
that when that moment comes

1226
01:07:13,796 --> 01:07:18,165
that everything you've done
up to that moment
has prepared you for victory!

1227
01:07:18,601 --> 01:07:20,398
I can't take credit
for it, Mike.

1228
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:23,961
I got to thank
these little digital guys
with the big hearts.

1229
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,736
Does it feel good to be
a champion? Yeah.

1230
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:30,142
Yeah, it feels good
to be a champion.
Good game.

1231
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:33,207
Hey, Brooke,
are you ready to go now?

1232
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:36,912
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure.
Great.

1233
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:39,079
Hey, Gary, thanks a lot, man.
It was great to meet you.

1234
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:40,520
Absolutely, man.

1235
01:07:41,657 --> 01:07:44,820
Come on, Mike. I know
a great little martini bar.

1236
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:08,774
<i>Yo.</i>

1237
01:08:08,851 --> 01:08:10,910
Hey, man, saddle up.
It's time to rope in
some talent.

1238
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:11,975
<i>What's up? What do you got?</i>

1239
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:14,614
My place. Tonight. Poker.
Call some girls up.

1240
01:08:16,192 --> 01:08:18,956
Your roommate is awesome.

1241
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:20,256
Mmm.

1242
01:08:20,563 --> 01:08:22,292
Yeah, he's something.

1243
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:26,759
So, where did you go
to law school?
Oh, Northwestern.

1244
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:29,870
God, Gary's hilarious.

1245
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,532
Yeah, he's okay.

1246
01:08:33,075 --> 01:08:35,600
Okay? I mean,
the guy's all time.

1247
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:39,247
But he's gonna take
Chicago tourism
by air, land and sea.

1248
01:08:42,151 --> 01:08:44,210
And he asked me to join
his new bowling team.

1249
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:46,311
I mean, how cool is that?

1250
01:08:46,388 --> 01:08:47,514
Mmm-hmm.

1251
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,520
You know what?
I can't do this.
I'm so sorry.

1252
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:54,154
Excuse me,
would you please pull over?
Can you pull over, please?

1253
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:02,804
Hey, wait.

1254
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:06,033
Tell Gary to call me.

1255
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:09,503
<i>Welcome, everyone,</i>

1256
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:12,877
to the first annual
Texas Hold'em No-Limit
Strip Poker Tournament.

1257
01:09:14,116 --> 01:09:17,677
Now, per the e-mail
that Lupus sent, we each have
eight articles of clothing.

1258
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:19,948
Now, if you want to bet,
you take off an article
of clothing,

1259
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:21,114
you put it in the center.

1260
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:24,489
If you win,
you take back the clothes,
you put back on what you bet.

1261
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,653
The extras that
other people bet
will stay in front of you,

1262
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:27,991
much the same as chips would.

1263
01:09:28,063 --> 01:09:29,496
You can go all in
at any point,

1264
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:32,625
but as I outlined,
you must take off
all your clothes to do so.

1265
01:09:32,701 --> 01:09:34,896
The game shall last an hour,
maybe two,

1266
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:38,770
at which point we will begin
the dance portion
of the evening.

1267
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:41,370
Let's get going here.

1268
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:42,637
I need to see the blinds.
Small blind. Big blind.

1269
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:43,837
The blinds are one and one.

1270
01:09:43,913 --> 01:09:45,244
Come on, ladies.
All right.

1271
01:09:45,314 --> 01:09:47,339
Oh, yeah.
Let's get going here.

1272
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:50,110
Shuffle up and deal.
All right.

1273
01:09:53,088 --> 01:09:54,646
I mean, just because
they were playing
video games,

1274
01:09:54,723 --> 01:09:57,248
that doesn't mean
it didn't bother him, right?

1275
01:09:57,326 --> 01:10:00,727
Honestly, Brooke,
I wish I could tell you,
but I wasn't there.

1276
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:02,693
All right, Sally,
get the soap
out of your mouth.

1277
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:04,699
We're gonna save that
for when you're 12.

1278
01:10:04,767 --> 01:10:06,792
Mike was really,
really good-looking.

1279
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:09,497
I mean,
he's a little bit of a goof,
but Gary doesn't know that.

1280
01:10:09,572 --> 01:10:12,063
I mean, for all he knows,
a sophisticated,

1281
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:14,905
really good-looking guy
took me out on a date tonight.

1282
01:10:14,977 --> 01:10:17,445
I could be in bed
with this guy right now
for all he knows.

1283
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:18,707
You know?

1284
01:10:18,814 --> 01:10:21,715
I'm telling you,
if you saw the look
on his face,

1285
01:10:23,185 --> 01:10:24,709
Mike got to him.

1286
01:11:22,511 --> 01:11:23,500
Hello.

1287
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:26,911
<i>Hey, it's Riggleman.
Great news.</i>

1288
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:37,718
So, how does this work?

1289
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:40,380
I'll bring the car
around front
and you wrap them up to go?

1290
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:42,447
Oh, no, no.
We take care of everything.

1291
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:46,722
We deliver it. We hang it.
We check the light
and the sun exposure.

1292
01:12:46,795 --> 01:12:48,524
Oh. Perfect.
Yeah.

1293
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:52,500
Listen, I don't want to be
too forward,

1294
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:56,396
but would you like to have
some dinner with me sometime?

1295
01:12:59,942 --> 01:13:02,604
I'm sorry. I have a boyfriend.

1296
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:04,474
Of course.
So...

1297
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:07,208
Well, he's a lucky man.
Oh, thank you.

1298
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:11,747
I guess I will just have
to keep it to home deliveries
and gallery purchases.

1299
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:15,046
Thank you, though. See you.

1300
01:13:15,124 --> 01:13:17,285
Have a good day, Brooke.
You, too.

1301
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:27,535
Okay, are you
out of your mind?

1302
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:30,165
Gary's throwing Greek orgies
in your living room

1303
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,332
and you're telling
hot rich guys
you have a boyfriend?

1304
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:35,571
Are you nuts?
Hey, look.
I'm not exactly innocent here.

1305
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:38,338
Brooke, as an outsider
with some perspective,
I really think you...

1306
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,279
Christopher, stop. Stop it.
I don't want to hear it.

1307
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:41,611
This has already gotten
way out of hand.

1308
01:13:41,683 --> 01:13:45,244
I know what I have
to do now, all right?
I know what I have to do.

1309
01:14:05,207 --> 01:14:06,299
Hi.

1310
01:14:07,042 --> 01:14:08,031
Hi.

1311
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:14,113
Did you get my note?
Yeah.

1312
01:14:16,084 --> 01:14:17,381
Two weeks.

1313
01:14:19,054 --> 01:14:20,043
Yep.

1314
01:14:23,258 --> 01:14:25,726
I brought some boxes
from work,

1315
01:14:26,428 --> 01:14:29,522
so, you know,
if you need any
just help yourself.

1316
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:34,197
Great. Thanks.

1317
01:14:38,874 --> 01:14:39,966
Oh.

1318
01:14:40,042 --> 01:14:44,536
Listen, a while ago
I got these tickets

1319
01:14:44,613 --> 01:14:48,845
for the Old 97's tonight,
and I completely forgot
about it, so I...

1320
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:52,344
You know, if you want to go.

1321
01:14:56,225 --> 01:14:58,386
Well, how many tickets
did you get?

1322
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:00,086
I got two.

1323
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:04,426
How much do you want for them?

1324
01:15:04,967 --> 01:15:06,867
Oh, no, I'm going. I'm going.

1325
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:12,304
So, then it would just be
the two of us?

1326
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:18,145
Well, yes,
and 2,000 other people.

1327
01:15:19,114 --> 01:15:21,309
I mean, it's not a big deal,

1328
01:15:21,383 --> 01:15:24,250
but, you know, look, you know,
I was going to invite Addie,

1329
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:27,413
but I just figured
I'd gotten them for you, so...

1330
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:35,792
Sure. Why not?

1331
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:39,362
Are you sure? I mean,
if you don't want them,

1332
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:42,232
I can definitely give them
to somebody.
No. No, I'll be there.

1333
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:45,933
That sounds...
It sounds great.

1334
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:50,906
Okay. All right.
It's at the Riv.

1335
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:54,643
So, I'll just leave
your ticket at Will Call.

1336
01:15:56,084 --> 01:15:57,551
Good?
Okay.

1337
01:15:57,619 --> 01:15:58,608
Okay.

1338
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,851
Yeah, so, there.
I'll just leave that for him.
Okay, great.

1339
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:09,090
Okay, so.
Gary Grobowski?

1340
01:16:09,164 --> 01:16:10,722
Grobowski, yeah.
He should be here in a minute.

1341
01:16:10,799 --> 01:16:13,233
He's really...
He's oddly tall, so.
Oh, okay. Great.

1342
01:16:13,302 --> 01:16:15,065
You won't miss him. Thanks.
All right, have a good night.

1343
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:40,855
Hi. Can I get a beer, please?
Sure.

1344
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:42,829
Actually, make that two beers.

1345
01:16:49,037 --> 01:16:51,267
It's gonna be $8.

1346
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:53,798
Excuse me. Sorry.

1347
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:04,880
<i>Hello, everybody!</i>

1348
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,982
<i>Good evening, Chicago.
We're the Old 97's.</i>

1349
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:00,557
Brooke?

1350
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:07,773
Are you up?
Yeah.

1351
01:19:09,444 --> 01:19:11,935
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

1352
01:19:13,515 --> 01:19:16,780
Are you sure?
What's up? What do you want?

1353
01:19:20,388 --> 01:19:23,721
I just want to say
I'm sorry that I missed
the concert,

1354
01:19:24,559 --> 01:19:28,017
and let me know
what that ticket cost,
I'll pay you back for it.

1355
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:34,029
Just leave me alone, Gary.

1356
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:40,398
I planned on going
to the concert.

1357
01:19:40,475 --> 01:19:41,965
It's just, I stopped by
Johnny O's and we...

1358
01:19:42,043 --> 01:19:43,374
It doesn't fucking matter,
okay?

1359
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:46,107
Would you just leave my room
and shut the door?

1360
01:19:46,581 --> 01:19:48,572
Jesus.
Please.

1361
01:19:52,354 --> 01:19:55,346
I didn't really know
that the concert mattered
all that much to you.

1362
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:56,412
Exactly.

1363
01:19:57,425 --> 01:19:59,325
Hold on a second here.
Let me talk for a second.

1364
01:19:59,394 --> 01:20:00,383
Gary...

1365
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:03,954
Brooke. You broke up with me.

1366
01:20:07,369 --> 01:20:09,234
Then you have guys
coming over here for dates,

1367
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:11,465
and all of a sudden
you ask me to go
to some concert.

1368
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:13,201
I mean, I just figured that,
you know.

1369
01:20:13,275 --> 01:20:14,572
Gary.

1370
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:21,613
I just... I don't know
how we got here.

1371
01:20:26,388 --> 01:20:28,117
Our entire relationship

1372
01:20:28,757 --> 01:20:32,625
I've gone above
and beyond for you, for us.

1373
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:37,226
And I mean, I've cooked.

1374
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:40,861
I've picked your shit up
off the floor.

1375
01:20:40,936 --> 01:20:44,463
I've laid your clothes
out for you like you were
a four-year-old.

1376
01:20:45,373 --> 01:20:48,467
I support you.
I supported you, your work.

1377
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:53,571
If we ever had dinner
or anything,
I make the plans.

1378
01:20:53,648 --> 01:20:58,415
I take care of everything and
I just don't feel like you
appreciate any of it.

1379
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:04,048
I don't feel
you appreciate me.

1380
01:21:07,596 --> 01:21:12,431
And all I want is to...
Is for you to just show me
that you care.

1381
01:21:18,306 --> 01:21:20,467
Why didn't you just
say that to me?

1382
01:21:21,176 --> 01:21:24,737
Gary, I've tried. I've tried.

1383
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:27,242
Yeah, but never like that.

1384
01:21:28,783 --> 01:21:31,445
You might've said
some things that you meant
to imply that, Brooke,

1385
01:21:31,519 --> 01:21:33,248
but I'm not a mind reader.

1386
01:21:35,257 --> 01:21:38,317
I doubt it would matter.
You are who you are.

1387
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:43,895
Just leave me alone, okay?

1388
01:21:45,867 --> 01:21:47,732
Right now. Just shut my door.

1389
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:53,398
Listen.

1390
01:21:53,475 --> 01:21:56,000
All right, Gary, just, please.
Just leave the room.

1391
01:21:56,077 --> 01:21:57,101
Listen to me.
Gary, just...

1392
01:21:57,178 --> 01:21:59,646
I don't want to be
near you right now.
Listen to me.
I just want to...

1393
01:21:59,714 --> 01:22:02,774
Please, just shut the door.
Please.

1394
01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:18,765
I know. Look, I know
you feel bad, but, you know,
what are you gonna do?

1395
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:21,631
I mean, what does she expect,
for me to want to go with
the girl who dumped me?

1396
01:22:21,703 --> 01:22:24,433
I don't know. She probably
just wanted you, you know,
to show her the respect

1397
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:26,337
of not standing her up
or some shit, who knows?

1398
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:28,239
Well, damn it.
I should have just said
no in the first place.

1399
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:29,368
I don't know why I called...

1400
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:30,468
You know what?
It's her fault she got hurt.

1401
01:22:30,545 --> 01:22:34,538
You shouldn't even feel bad
about it. She should have
expected it from you.

1402
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:39,810
You're a fun guy, okay?
Everybody likes you.

1403
01:22:39,888 --> 01:22:43,380
You're the quickest guy
I know. Anytime we go out,
I have a blast.

1404
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:44,857
All right? But, you know,

1405
01:22:44,926 --> 01:22:47,952
everybody who knows you
knows you're gonna do
what you want to do.

1406
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:52,193
And if it's not what the
other person wants to do,
well, that's their problem.

1407
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:53,795
That's bullshit.
It's not bullshit.

1408
01:22:53,868 --> 01:22:55,597
There's plenty of times
I do shit that
I don't want to do.

1409
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:57,069
That's ridiculous. No.
Like when?

1410
01:22:57,138 --> 01:22:58,230
That's bullshit to say
about me.

1411
01:22:58,306 --> 01:23:01,332
When have we ever
done something
you didn't want to do?

1412
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:05,545
You know, I don't know,
off the top of my head.
I don't keep score...

1413
01:23:05,613 --> 01:23:07,843
When's the last time
we went to a Sox game?

1414
01:23:07,916 --> 01:23:09,247
The Sox.

1415
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:11,808
Not when they're playing
the Cubs, either.

1416
01:23:12,587 --> 01:23:15,613
We always do what you want
to do and she always did
what you want to do.

1417
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:17,089
It's who you are.

1418
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:19,683
Everybody thinks
that you're their friend,
okay?

1419
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:21,661
But the fact of the matter is
that there's not one person

1420
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:23,527
that I know that
you trust enough
to let close enough

1421
01:23:23,598 --> 01:23:24,622
that they could hurt you.

1422
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:28,567
And her big problem
is that you really liked her.

1423
01:23:28,636 --> 01:23:31,264
I mean, she is the one girl
you really liked.

1424
01:23:31,373 --> 01:23:33,238
And no matter what she did
and how hard she tried,

1425
01:23:33,308 --> 01:23:35,435
you were never gonna
let your guard down.

1426
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:37,705
That poor girl
never stood a chance.

1427
01:24:16,317 --> 01:24:17,306
Marilyn?

1428
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:22,690
Marilyn?
Yeah.

1429
01:24:26,995 --> 01:24:31,329
I'm sorry. I just...

1430
01:24:31,933 --> 01:24:33,093
Oh, just get in here.

1431
01:24:33,168 --> 01:24:35,398
Oh, okay.
I'm sorry, excuse me.

1432
01:24:36,337 --> 01:24:37,770
Marilyn, I just...

1433
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:41,366
I just wanted to let you know
that today is gonna be
my last day.

1434
01:24:43,978 --> 01:24:46,310
I'm gonna be traveling
for a bit.

1435
01:24:55,890 --> 01:24:57,380
Here's a blank check.

1436
01:24:57,459 --> 01:25:01,395
Write down a number, I don't
want to know what it is,
and go back to work.

1437
01:25:01,529 --> 01:25:03,895
No, no. It's not about that.

1438
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:06,923
I can't accept that.

1439
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:09,393
Brooke.

1440
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:13,165
Travis, get your gorgeous
tuckus out of here.

1441
01:25:21,749 --> 01:25:24,013
If you make it to Rome,

1442
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:28,153
search out an establishment
called the Padre Negro.

1443
01:25:28,456 --> 01:25:32,256
Ask for a strapping young
fellow named Alberto.

1444
01:25:33,094 --> 01:25:35,085
Compliments of M. Dean.

1445
01:25:38,166 --> 01:25:41,101
Well, thank you.
I appreciate that.

1446
01:25:41,336 --> 01:25:43,896
Yeah. And, honey,

1447
01:25:45,073 --> 01:25:47,667
take as long as you want,
because when you're done,

1448
01:25:47,742 --> 01:25:50,302
your job will be right here
waiting for you.

1449
01:25:51,412 --> 01:25:55,473
And if you discover a path
that doesn't lead back here...

1450
01:25:56,618 --> 01:25:58,552
Well, I hope you'll text.

1451
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:03,051
I will.

1452
01:26:13,034 --> 01:26:16,299
And, like I said,
the apartment's a mess,
but I'm moving, so...

1453
01:26:16,371 --> 01:26:19,067
It's okay. Relax about
the place. I don't care.

1454
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:21,540
Okay. This'll just take
a second.
Okay.

1455
01:26:28,049 --> 01:26:31,678
Hello?
Hey. I'm in here.

1456
01:26:39,127 --> 01:26:41,425
Don't say anything. I...

1457
01:26:42,597 --> 01:26:44,121
How're you doing?

1458
01:26:50,838 --> 01:26:53,363
Could I talk to you in private
for a second?

1459
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:58,274
You know what?
This is really
not a good time,

1460
01:26:58,346 --> 01:27:00,871
and obviously you have
something happening here,

1461
01:27:00,949 --> 01:27:03,349
so we'll just be in...
No, no, I don't have
anything going on.

1462
01:27:03,418 --> 01:27:05,716
This is actually for you.

1463
01:27:08,122 --> 01:27:10,454
I'm just gonna wait outside.
No, no. Wait.

1464
01:27:10,525 --> 01:27:12,550
No, no. Really. It's okay.

1465
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:17,389
I really can't do this
right now.

1466
01:27:17,465 --> 01:27:20,366
Brooke, this whole thing
has been really tough on me

1467
01:27:20,868 --> 01:27:23,803
and I've tried to act
like it hasn't been
that tough on me,

1468
01:27:23,871 --> 01:27:26,567
but the first Sunday
after me and you broke up,

1469
01:27:26,674 --> 01:27:28,665
it all kind of really hit me.

1470
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:30,643
And I think
it partially hit me

1471
01:27:30,712 --> 01:27:34,148
because Sunday was sort of
always our day that we
would do stuff together.

1472
01:27:34,215 --> 01:27:37,844
But I didn't have any idea
you still cared so much.

1473
01:27:38,886 --> 01:27:42,049
And, you know,
when I saw you crying
the other night,

1474
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:45,416
that was honestly
the worst moment of my life.

1475
01:27:47,662 --> 01:27:48,686
Gary.

1476
01:27:48,763 --> 01:27:52,130
Let me just try to say
some of these things here.
It's just...

1477
01:27:52,634 --> 01:27:53,828
Look,

1478
01:27:55,336 --> 01:27:58,931
I know that I've caused you
a lot of pain.

1479
01:28:00,408 --> 01:28:04,367
And the funny thing is,
all I really want to do
is make you happy.

1480
01:28:05,413 --> 01:28:07,313
I just want to make you smile.

1481
01:28:07,382 --> 01:28:10,374
Now, I've had a lot of time
to think about
some of the things

1482
01:28:10,451 --> 01:28:13,682
that went on, and I know,
Brooke, that I don't always
do the right thing

1483
01:28:13,755 --> 01:28:15,723
or always say
the right things,

1484
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:18,588
but I am willing to try
to do things differently.

1485
01:28:18,793 --> 01:28:21,284
And I'd be happy to go
take a dance class.

1486
01:28:21,396 --> 01:28:24,957
Well, I would. Honestly.
I would like to go do that.
Or go travel.

1487
01:28:25,099 --> 01:28:27,761
I mean, I'd even be willing
to go to the ballet.

1488
01:28:27,835 --> 01:28:32,772
Although I would much rather
do the dance class
or take a trip somewhere.

1489
01:28:33,107 --> 01:28:34,768
But I realize
that's not the point.

1490
01:28:34,842 --> 01:28:36,969
I realize that the point
isn't that at all,

1491
01:28:37,045 --> 01:28:41,141
because it's not really
about doing things
that you love to do always,

1492
01:28:41,215 --> 01:28:44,810
but it is about doing things
with the person that you love.

1493
01:28:45,687 --> 01:28:47,814
And I love you.

1494
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:54,260
Gary.
Just give me one second here.

1495
01:28:55,463 --> 01:28:57,328
I've missed you so much.

1496
01:29:00,601 --> 01:29:02,091
I promise you, Brooke,

1497
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:06,573
I will do whatever it is
that I have to do
to never hurt you again.

1498
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:11,376
I love you and I'm sorry.

1499
01:29:15,083 --> 01:29:17,176
Okay, that's it.
That's all I...

1500
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:20,683
Oh, God.
That's all I wanted to say,

1501
01:29:20,755 --> 01:29:24,316
so you can go ahead now
with anything that
you're feeling to say.

1502
01:29:27,829 --> 01:29:29,558
I don't know what to say.

1503
01:29:30,665 --> 01:29:32,860
Just say whatever
you feel inside.

1504
01:29:40,641 --> 01:29:42,905
I don't feel the same way.

1505
01:29:47,315 --> 01:29:49,783
I don't. I just...
I don't know.

1506
01:29:50,852 --> 01:29:52,149
Oh, God.

1507
01:29:54,355 --> 01:29:57,381
I just, I think...
I don't know,

1508
01:29:57,458 --> 01:29:59,653
but I don't think I have

1509
01:30:00,128 --> 01:30:03,757
anything left to give.

1510
01:30:06,367 --> 01:30:07,766
I'm sorry.

1511
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:16,740
I was hoping for...

1512
01:30:21,282 --> 01:30:22,681
It doesn't matter.

1513
01:30:28,523 --> 01:30:30,718
Oh, this is now
beyond awkward.

1514
01:30:30,792 --> 01:30:33,590
There's some new guy
standing out in the hallway

1515
01:30:33,661 --> 01:30:37,597
and I think I'm gonna go.

1516
01:30:42,537 --> 01:30:43,731
Okay.

1517
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:48,909
Thank you.

1518
01:30:52,647 --> 01:30:55,377
I made a dinner,
and I don't know if
it's any good or not,

1519
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:57,384
but you're welcome to have it.

1520
01:30:58,719 --> 01:30:59,811
Okay.

1521
01:31:04,692 --> 01:31:07,388
Gary, that's really...
That's not what
you think that it is.

1522
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:08,588
It's okay.

1523
01:31:10,031 --> 01:31:11,931
I'm gonna go take a walk.

1524
01:31:36,357 --> 01:31:38,621
I'm sorry about that.
No.

1525
01:31:38,926 --> 01:31:42,225
I'm sorry I imposed.
No, that's fine. Please.

1526
01:31:43,865 --> 01:31:47,733
So, what do you think?
I think you're right.

1527
01:31:47,802 --> 01:31:50,134
I think it's great.
Good.

1528
01:31:50,838 --> 01:31:52,430
Okay.
Okay.

1529
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:53,633
So,

1530
01:31:55,409 --> 01:31:58,469
I will have that wrapped up.

1531
01:31:58,546 --> 01:32:01,276
Packed up, sorry,
and delivered.

1532
01:32:02,149 --> 01:32:04,083
Thank you for taking the time
to show it to me, okay?

1533
01:32:04,151 --> 01:32:05,277
Sure.

1534
01:32:05,486 --> 01:32:08,011
Yeah. I'm gonna run.
Okay, I'll walk you out.

1535
01:32:08,089 --> 01:32:10,421
No, no, no.
I can... It's okay.

1536
01:32:24,438 --> 01:32:27,498
So, the thing that
I was most afraid
of happening happened

1537
01:32:27,575 --> 01:32:32,103
and I don't regret it at all,
because now she knows
how I feel.

1538
01:32:34,415 --> 01:32:37,145
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah.

1539
01:32:37,218 --> 01:32:41,416
I think,
what you got to do now
is really think hard,

1540
01:32:42,490 --> 01:32:44,583
because you have
to find somebody

1541
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:48,128
that can't be traced back
to either of us

1542
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:51,092
to visit this guy.

1543
01:32:51,532 --> 01:32:53,659
What are you talking about?
I don't...

1544
01:32:53,734 --> 01:32:55,463
The guy who came with her.

1545
01:32:55,536 --> 01:32:57,970
I don't need anything
to happen to the guy.

1546
01:32:58,039 --> 01:32:59,700
But if they could trace him
back to either one of us...

1547
01:32:59,774 --> 01:33:01,901
It's not about him.
I don't care about that.
...it's a problem.

1548
01:33:01,976 --> 01:33:04,570
The guy, he's not a...
They're not dumb.
Cops are smart, trust me.

1549
01:33:04,645 --> 01:33:06,579
Okay, but he's not
a problem to me.
Right.

1550
01:33:06,647 --> 01:33:08,444
Listen to me.

1551
01:33:08,516 --> 01:33:11,952
Promise me that you're
not gonna do anything.

1552
01:33:12,019 --> 01:33:13,111
I got you.

1553
01:33:13,788 --> 01:33:16,154
It's better if nobody...
You don't know anything.

1554
01:33:16,223 --> 01:33:17,713
What are you talking about?
I'll take care of it.

1555
01:33:17,792 --> 01:33:19,783
I don't want you
to take care of anything.
John, do me a favor.

1556
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:22,886
I'm being serious with you.
I know, I know.
Smart. You're smart.

1557
01:33:22,964 --> 01:33:24,295
No, I'm not.
I'm being honest with you.

1558
01:33:24,365 --> 01:33:25,764
I don't want anything
to happen to him.
Me, either.

1559
01:33:25,833 --> 01:33:27,892
Promise me you're not
gonna have anyone
do anything to this guy.

1560
01:33:27,969 --> 01:33:29,869
But you've gotta
tell me exactly
what you're gonna tell them,

1561
01:33:29,937 --> 01:33:31,837
if the cops come to you.
Because if we tell
a different story...

1562
01:33:31,906 --> 01:33:33,703
Nothing.
Promise me one thing.
We don't care...

1563
01:33:33,774 --> 01:33:35,765
John, I'm gonna go home.
I can't do this.
I'm exhausted.

1564
01:33:35,843 --> 01:33:38,175
Right, go home. Just make sure
your neighbors know
you're going home.

1565
01:33:38,245 --> 01:33:41,942
Do me a favor.
They got phone records. Make
a couple phone calls tonight.

1566
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:43,745
Especially around 10:00.

1567
01:33:44,652 --> 01:33:47,143
Okay. Please don't
do anything. All right.

1568
01:33:47,221 --> 01:33:48,882
I don't mean it like...
I mean, honestly.

1569
01:33:48,956 --> 01:33:50,321
No, no, I got it.

1570
01:33:54,862 --> 01:33:57,160
For all you know,
nothing's happening.

1571
01:33:57,665 --> 01:33:59,997
I don't want anything
to happen.
Right.

1572
01:34:00,067 --> 01:34:01,432
Say it louder.

1573
01:35:30,424 --> 01:35:32,517
What are you doing here
so early?

1574
01:35:55,082 --> 01:35:56,106
Hey.

1575
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:02,585
Everything okay
with you and...
Yeah, everything's
gonna be great.

1576
01:36:02,656 --> 01:36:07,116
I just wanna get
my day started,
but I just wanted to say that

1577
01:36:07,962 --> 01:36:10,692
I'm sorry it took
so long for me to...

1578
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:13,832
I love you, Dennis.

1579
01:36:15,803 --> 01:36:18,033
It's all right. It's okay.

1580
01:36:19,673 --> 01:36:22,540
I'm sorry. I'm gonna go
do the stuff.

1581
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:51,161
So, that's it
for all my stuff.

1582
01:36:54,275 --> 01:36:58,371
If you want, you could give me
your key and I'll drop it off
at Riggleman's.

1583
01:36:58,846 --> 01:37:00,108
All right.

1584
01:37:09,456 --> 01:37:10,650
Thanks.

1585
01:37:11,826 --> 01:37:12,815
Gary.

1586
01:37:13,727 --> 01:37:17,219
You know, there's
a thousand things I...

1587
01:37:18,232 --> 01:37:20,200
I would have done differently.

1588
01:37:22,369 --> 01:37:23,563
Me, too.

1589
01:37:25,606 --> 01:37:30,066
Sort of, actually,
when I see this space, I
realize that if we didn't have

1590
01:37:30,144 --> 01:37:33,944
such a big coffee table
and that oversized couch

1591
01:37:35,316 --> 01:37:39,776
a pool table
would have fit nicely.

1592
01:37:39,954 --> 01:37:41,046
Yeah.

1593
01:37:41,889 --> 01:37:46,849
Although the oversized couch
did come in very useful the
last couple of weeks, so...

1594
01:37:47,027 --> 01:37:48,688
Yes, it... I guess.

1595
01:37:54,635 --> 01:37:56,000
Have a good trip.

1596
01:37:58,405 --> 01:37:59,702
Thanks.

1597
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:11,645
<i>Chicago is called
the Second City</i>

1598
01:38:11,719 --> 01:38:14,950
<i>because after the
Great Chicago Fire of 1871,</i>

1599
01:38:15,022 --> 01:38:16,751
<i>Chicago was rebuilt
on its ruins.</i>

1600
01:38:16,824 --> 01:38:20,521
<i>The city came back
even bigger and stronger
than it originally was.</i>

1601
01:38:20,594 --> 01:38:24,553
<i>So it's not really an insult,
it's more of a badge of honor
to be called...</i>

1602
01:38:25,299 --> 01:38:26,789
The Second City!

1603
01:38:27,735 --> 01:38:29,362
<i>Okay. People, you might
be able to get away</i>

1604
01:38:29,436 --> 01:38:31,802
<i>with that reaction at work,
but you are on vacation here.</i>

1605
01:38:31,872 --> 01:38:35,171
<i>If you can't blow it out here,
then where the hell
can you blow it out?</i>

1606
01:38:35,242 --> 01:38:37,107
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
show me that you mean it.</i>

1607
01:38:37,177 --> 01:38:39,372
<i>Do not make me ask you twice.</i>

1608
01:38:39,847 --> 01:38:42,042
<i>Are you ready to see Chicago?
Yes!</i>

1609
01:38:42,116 --> 01:38:44,311
<i>I said, are you ready
to see Chicago?
Yes!</i>

1610
01:38:44,385 --> 01:38:48,685
<i>Are you ready to see Chicago?
Shondra, put this babe
in the air.</i>

1611
01:38:48,756 --> 01:38:49,780
<i>Let's go!</i>

1612
01:38:50,257 --> 01:38:52,919
<i>There is a bar downstairs.
Please enjoy yourself.</i>

1613
01:38:52,993 --> 01:38:55,120
<i>I know it's early
in the morning, but it is
Chicago in the summer.</i>

1614
01:38:55,195 --> 01:38:56,321
<i>Who are we kidding? It's fine.</i>

1615
01:38:56,397 --> 01:38:58,228
<i>Go get hopped up,
make some bad decisions.</i>

1616
01:38:58,299 --> 01:39:00,460
<i>My jokes get better.
The buildings look bigger.</i>

1617
01:39:20,187 --> 01:39:22,985
It's not so important
that everything is finished.

1618
01:39:23,057 --> 01:39:25,457
It's important that
everything is right.

1619
01:39:25,559 --> 01:39:27,720
Well, what time's
the presentation?

1620
01:39:27,861 --> 01:39:30,625
All right, I'll pick up
the rest of the stuff
and I'll see you at 6:45.

1621
01:39:30,698 --> 01:39:32,256
Great. Bye.

1622
01:39:32,733 --> 01:39:33,961
Brooke!

1623
01:39:39,573 --> 01:39:42,371
Hi.
Hi.

1624
01:39:43,978 --> 01:39:45,172
Wow.

1625
01:39:47,214 --> 01:39:50,115
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.

1626
01:39:50,284 --> 01:39:54,550
I'd give you a hug,
but my hands are kind of
full with all the bags here.

1627
01:39:56,957 --> 01:39:59,289
How've you been?
I've been really good.

1628
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:01,828
How have you been?
I've been good.

1629
01:40:02,429 --> 01:40:03,691
Yeah.

1630
01:40:04,832 --> 01:40:06,697
You look great.
Thank you.

1631
01:40:06,767 --> 01:40:10,066
The hair's a little different.
Looks nice.
Yeah? Oh, yeah.

1632
01:40:11,005 --> 01:40:14,600
You've lost some weight.
Well, it's very
deceiving, actually.

1633
01:40:14,675 --> 01:40:19,510
I've managed to become thin
without having any real muscle
on me whatsoever.

1634
01:40:19,613 --> 01:40:22,878
Very tough thing to
accomplish, by the way.
I'm proud of myself.

1635
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:25,441
Well, you look terrific.
Thanks.

1636
01:40:26,553 --> 01:40:29,954
I heard your trip
went really well.
It did. It went really well.

1637
01:40:30,024 --> 01:40:31,616
Oh, good.
It was fun. It was amazing.

1638
01:40:31,692 --> 01:40:34,252
I saw so many amazing places.
It was just...

1639
01:40:34,628 --> 01:40:38,826
But, you know,
you do realize
how much you love home.

1640
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:42,936
It's good to have you back.
Yeah. It's good to be back.

1641
01:40:45,773 --> 01:40:48,799
And the boat.
Congratulations on the boat.
Thanks.

1642
01:40:48,909 --> 01:40:51,776
I'm waiting for it
to get warm, and I'm gonna
come by and take a ride.

1643
01:40:51,845 --> 01:40:54,678
Well, anytime you want.
It'll be on the house.
Come on by.

1644
01:40:54,748 --> 01:40:56,807
Well, I will, then.

1645
01:40:58,252 --> 01:40:59,742
I hope you do.

1646
01:41:01,088 --> 01:41:02,248
Definitely.

1647
01:41:06,293 --> 01:41:09,126
Well, I got to...
I'm going to a meeting, so...

1648
01:41:09,196 --> 01:41:13,997
I got to drop these bags
off anyway, but it's really
good to see you, Brooke.

1649
01:41:14,401 --> 01:41:17,029
Really good to see you.
Shouldn't...

1650
01:41:17,838 --> 01:41:19,271
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

1651
01:41:19,339 --> 01:41:22,706
I'm just saying we shouldn't
wait so long the next time
before we...

1652
01:41:22,776 --> 01:41:24,141
Yeah.
...catch up.

1653
01:41:24,211 --> 01:41:26,611
We have a lot more
to talk about.
Yeah.

1654
01:41:27,014 --> 01:41:28,003
So.

1655
01:41:29,349 --> 01:41:30,976
Be good.
Okay.

1656
01:41:31,051 --> 01:41:32,245
Bye.
Bye.
