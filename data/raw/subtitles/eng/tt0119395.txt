1
00:01:54,487 --> 00:01:59,277
Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.

2
00:02:24,767 --> 00:02:29,045
...bringing to an end the Soviet empire
and its 70-year experiment in communism.

3
00:02:29,127 --> 00:02:32,039
Yet while jubilation
at the prospect of freedom...

4
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:40,519
The Russian mafia has evolved into
a world-class organized crime network...

5
00:02:40,607 --> 00:02:44,441
...with profits in billions,
including substantial US operations.

6
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:58,319
...announcing the unprecedented opening
of an FBI legal attache...

7
00:02:58,967 --> 00:03:03,563
...along with the first-ever joint US
and Russian law enforcement operation.

8
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:25,198
It's her.

9
00:05:10,407 --> 00:05:12,875
Ghazzi's in the club. He's in position.

10
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:15,242
Okay. Op's a go. MVD only.

11
00:06:15,487 --> 00:06:19,958
What is this? An American?
Who the fuck are you?

12
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:23,161
Deputy Director Carter Preston, FBI.

13
00:06:23,247 --> 00:06:25,078
FBI.

14
00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:29,718
You fuck Americans now,
you ugly militia whore.

15
00:06:30,407 --> 00:06:33,444
And, you, go fuck yourself.

16
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:35,597
This is not Chicago. This is Russia.

17
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:38,406
So take your bitch
and get the fuck out of here.

18
00:06:38,647 --> 00:06:41,161
Do you think I'm afraid of the MVD?

19
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:48,082
I swear I will kill you
and your fucking whore mothers.

20
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:49,566
I repeat, you are advised...

21
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:53,322
Fuck you, you scar-faced cunt!

22
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,997
- Fuck you!
- All right, that's enough!

23
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:34,076
It's never easy taking a life.

24
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:37,877
But you saved one, too. Mine.

25
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:41,798
Thank you.

26
00:07:50,927 --> 00:07:52,758
We had no warning.

27
00:07:52,927 --> 00:07:54,997
They must have ambushed
our man outside.

28
00:07:55,567 --> 00:08:00,004
Before we knew it, there were militia with
their guns out in every corner of the room.

29
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:02,317
They just opened fire and killed him.

30
00:08:03,607 --> 00:08:05,643
It happened so fast, it was...

31
00:08:05,727 --> 00:08:07,843
...over before it started.

32
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:11,045
God, my poor brother.

33
00:08:14,607 --> 00:08:16,996
How many militia did you kill?

34
00:08:19,047 --> 00:08:21,277
Terek, please, we didn't stand a chance.

35
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,198
There were 30 of them...

36
00:08:23,287 --> 00:08:26,802
...plus the Americans.
- Yes, but how many did you kill?

37
00:08:30,527 --> 00:08:32,643
Well, none.

38
00:08:33,207 --> 00:08:35,163
None? Not even one?

39
00:08:36,247 --> 00:08:38,078
Terek, please.

40
00:08:38,607 --> 00:08:40,325
I did what I could.

41
00:08:42,207 --> 00:08:45,643
You did what you could.

42
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:49,402
You let those militia pigs
and that American scum kill my brother...

43
00:08:50,087 --> 00:08:52,840
...without killing one in return.

44
00:08:53,927 --> 00:08:56,202
Okay, that's what you could do.

45
00:08:57,007 --> 00:08:58,918
Here's what I can do.

46
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:10,556
I loved this man like a brother.

47
00:09:10,807 --> 00:09:13,321
He was a dear friend and partner to me.

48
00:09:14,007 --> 00:09:16,316
So I took no joy in that.

49
00:09:17,607 --> 00:09:19,518
But just think...

50
00:09:20,007 --> 00:09:22,282
...if I could do this to one I love...

51
00:09:23,047 --> 00:09:25,766
...what could I do to someone I hate?

52
00:09:29,127 --> 00:09:33,325
The American FBI declares war on us?

53
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:39,437
Then war it is.

54
00:09:40,487 --> 00:09:43,320
Unlike other, less cunning predators...

55
00:09:43,407 --> 00:09:48,197
...the hyena takes no chances,
never attacking unless sure of a kill.

56
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:53,484
Though a consummate killer,
he is clearly no gentleman.

57
00:09:57,127 --> 00:09:59,595
I apologize for keeping you waiting.

58
00:09:59,687 --> 00:10:02,406
I had some other business to dispose of.

59
00:10:02,487 --> 00:10:04,000
So much wasted time...

60
00:10:04,087 --> 00:10:07,284
...confusing motion with accomplishment.
Another drink?

61
00:10:22,927 --> 00:10:25,122
The MVD killed my brother.

62
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,479
For that, I will see they drown in blood.

63
00:10:28,647 --> 00:10:32,686
But to their allies in America,
I wish to send a message.

64
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:35,681
A very public message.

65
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:38,998
I want to strike fear
into the marrow of their bones.

66
00:10:41,647 --> 00:10:43,922
Can you kill this person?

67
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:47,880
Yes.

68
00:10:54,607 --> 00:10:56,996
If I take this job, I'll have to disappear...

69
00:10:57,087 --> 00:10:58,645
...forever.

70
00:10:59,247 --> 00:11:02,603
So if you want me to do this,
you're going to have to pay me.

71
00:11:02,727 --> 00:11:04,445
How much?

72
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:06,725
American dollars.

73
00:11:06,807 --> 00:11:08,843
All cash, of course.

74
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:11,356
Half now, half upon completion.

75
00:11:16,127 --> 00:11:18,038
$70 million.

76
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:24,205
Why not?

77
00:11:24,487 --> 00:11:26,318
Done.

78
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,399
How many people know about this?

79
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,955
- You and I.
- Keep it that way.

80
00:11:31,647 --> 00:11:34,798
Don't refer to our arrangement
by telephone or fax, ever.

81
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:39,719
You should find a place outside of Russia
to hide until the mission's completed.

82
00:11:39,807 --> 00:11:43,516
If word of this leaks, it'll be my choice
whether to continue or not.

83
00:11:43,607 --> 00:11:47,395
Either way, I keep the initial payment.
Agreed?

84
00:11:48,247 --> 00:11:50,078
Okay.

85
00:11:52,047 --> 00:11:56,165
Informants tell us Terek's put bounties
on all MVD and FBI personnel.

86
00:11:56,247 --> 00:11:59,842
Deputy Director Preston
and I have special bounties on our lives.

87
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,839
In two weeks,
seven MVD operatives have been killed.

88
00:12:02,927 --> 00:12:06,363
- We know we're getting to him.
- Informants say this is just the start.

89
00:12:06,447 --> 00:12:08,881
Terek's planning something more dramatic.

90
00:12:10,207 --> 00:12:11,356
Eight days ago...

91
00:12:11,447 --> 00:12:14,564
...Terek and his lieutenants
were spotted in the town of Porvoo...

92
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:16,478
...60 kilometers west of Helsinki.

93
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:20,879
They're still there, taking the third floor
for themselves and their bodyguards...

94
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:24,039
...all former SPETSNAZ, nine in all.

95
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:26,601
Not one's left the building in five days.

96
00:12:26,727 --> 00:12:30,720
Their only contact with the outside
is this man: Victor Politovsky.

97
00:12:31,007 --> 00:12:35,558
He goes to the post office twice a day
for mail which arrives general delivery.

98
00:12:35,647 --> 00:12:38,719
Contact Interpol
and get everything you can on Politovsky.

99
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:43,800
Terek's men are notoriously hard to
turn out. Should we get the opportunity...

100
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:48,244
...we must be prepared to conduct
the interrogation with utmost efficiency.

101
00:12:48,327 --> 00:12:51,683
- Good day to you, Mr. Preston.
- Sir.

102
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:58,799
I don't think
I want to know what that means.

103
00:14:45,527 --> 00:14:47,882
The new lamination's the tricky part.

104
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,317
You got to use ethyl acetone.

105
00:14:50,407 --> 00:14:54,002
Nasty stuff. Gives you liver cancer.

106
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:57,325
And I use a disk drive
to erase the magnetic strip.

107
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:01,522
- It's perfect.
- Thank you.

108
00:15:01,607 --> 00:15:03,916
You really do beautiful work.

109
00:15:04,007 --> 00:15:06,965
- Art comes in various guises, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.

110
00:15:07,087 --> 00:15:09,726
- What do I owe you?
- Right.

111
00:15:10,567 --> 00:15:14,765
Well, I think your balance is about BP375.

112
00:15:15,487 --> 00:15:18,684
- This is BP500.
- Oh, thank you.

113
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:21,281
- Good luck with the baby.
- Thank you.

114
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:23,278
See you next time.

115
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:49,044
How do you want the accounts handled?

116
00:15:49,127 --> 00:15:52,119
Split the deposit equally between
the Macao and Panama accounts.

117
00:15:52,207 --> 00:15:54,516
- And the balance?
- Leave it here in dollars.

118
00:15:54,607 --> 00:15:56,882
I'll need you to open me
a Luxembourg account.

119
00:15:56,967 --> 00:16:01,358
And get me some credit cards. Use
an American bank. I'll send you the names.

120
00:16:01,447 --> 00:16:04,564
I'll overnight the credit cards
to your box in Montreal.

121
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:07,879
- This also came in the draft.
- Yes.

122
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,527
- I'll need to use your computer, Clive.
- Of course.

123
00:16:10,607 --> 00:16:13,599
- Everything's ready for you.
- Good. Thank you.

124
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,759
Good afternoon. How may we help you?

125
00:16:19,847 --> 00:16:23,556
I'm interested in an intermediate
range system, high cyclic rate.

126
00:16:26,087 --> 00:16:29,477
- Man portable?
- Compact, vehicle-mounted unit.

127
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:31,635
What caliber?

128
00:16:31,727 --> 00:16:34,082
No smaller than 7.62.

129
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:35,395
Available:

130
00:16:35,487 --> 00:16:40,003
7.62 millimeter M134 electric Gatling gun.

131
00:16:40,927 --> 00:16:44,237
I prefer non-US equipment,
single-parallel system.

132
00:16:44,647 --> 00:16:45,636
Available:

133
00:16:45,727 --> 00:16:49,720
Yugoslav 20 millimeter 19/55 cannon.

134
00:16:50,887 --> 00:16:52,479
Too heavy.

135
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:53,716
Available:

136
00:16:53,807 --> 00:16:57,800
Polish ZSU-33 electric, 14.5 millimeter.

137
00:16:57,887 --> 00:17:00,959
Cyclic rate: 1,400 rounds per minute.

138
00:17:02,127 --> 00:17:03,355
Interested.

139
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:07,122
Effective combat range: 3,500 meters.

140
00:17:07,207 --> 00:17:11,086
Muzzle velocity: 1,700 meters per second.

141
00:17:12,087 --> 00:17:13,122
I'll take it.

142
00:17:13,207 --> 00:17:16,802
Cost will be $200,000, US.

143
00:17:17,647 --> 00:17:21,276
Transfer of funds in the usual manner.
Half now, half on delivery...

144
00:17:21,487 --> 00:17:22,966
...to the following address:

145
00:17:23,047 --> 00:17:26,960
Letterham Shipping,
Montreal, Quebec, Canada...

146
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,686
...GIH 876.

147
00:17:29,927 --> 00:17:32,760
Client name: Murdock, Charles C.

148
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:45,317
"What are they planning?
Why is Terek in Finland?"

149
00:17:45,407 --> 00:17:48,922
"The Americans. Kill. Example."

150
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:52,757
"Jackal? What Jackal?
It doesn't make sense."

151
00:17:53,287 --> 00:17:55,118
"What are they planning?"

152
00:17:57,007 --> 00:17:58,645
"Who are you?"

153
00:18:02,607 --> 00:18:04,484
"You fucking Jackal."

154
00:18:08,727 --> 00:18:11,480
"Why you hanging around? Revive him."

155
00:18:13,807 --> 00:18:15,365
Jesus.

156
00:18:17,247 --> 00:18:21,365
Drug-assisted interrogation is
perfectly legal in matters of state security.

157
00:18:21,607 --> 00:18:25,441
Unfortunately, Mr. Politovsky
had an undiagnosed heart condition.

158
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:29,725
He said, "Jackal"?

159
00:18:30,647 --> 00:18:33,115
Does this mean something to you?

160
00:18:33,407 --> 00:18:36,205
There's supposedly a killer for hire
who uses that name.

161
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:38,642
Several assassinations
are credited to him...

162
00:18:38,727 --> 00:18:42,037
...but we've never been able to prove
if he even exists.

163
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,076
From time to time, he was KGB asset.

164
00:18:57,727 --> 00:19:00,446
- Do you have a name?
- No name.

165
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:05,039
Payments were made to the contracting
organization or a Hong Kong bank account.

166
00:19:05,847 --> 00:19:08,042
No KGB member has ever seen him.

167
00:19:08,127 --> 00:19:10,595
Do we know if he ever operated in the US?

168
00:19:11,047 --> 00:19:13,163
No. But...

169
00:19:15,047 --> 00:19:18,084
...Politovsky's briefcase
contained biographical material...

170
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:20,840
...on your Donald Brown,
Director of the FBI.

171
00:19:21,367 --> 00:19:24,439
Jesus Christ.
This guy's going for the gold, huh?

172
00:19:24,527 --> 00:19:26,836
- Get him on the phone for me.
- Yes, sir.

173
00:19:51,647 --> 00:19:54,002
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

174
00:19:54,087 --> 00:19:57,045
- Purpose of your visit to Canada?
- Steelhead.

175
00:19:59,127 --> 00:20:00,845
Fishing.

176
00:20:02,447 --> 00:20:04,563
Enjoy your stay, Mr. Hayslip.

177
00:20:04,647 --> 00:20:06,797
Thank you. I will.

178
00:20:10,087 --> 00:20:12,203
I'll give you a good deal on this minivan.

179
00:20:12,287 --> 00:20:14,039
It's brand-new. It's fully loaded.

180
00:20:14,127 --> 00:20:16,243
We've even got a six-disk CD changer.

181
00:20:16,327 --> 00:20:19,046
I'll need your driver's license
and credit card.

182
00:20:19,127 --> 00:20:20,879
I'll check this with the manager.

183
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:23,800
- Everything should be okay, Mr. Murdock.
- Make it Charlie.

184
00:20:23,887 --> 00:20:26,959
- All right, Charlie. See you in a second.
- Take your time.

185
00:21:33,047 --> 00:21:35,959
I want this op close-hold, no publicity.

186
00:21:36,647 --> 00:21:40,037
Put a working group together:
State, CIA, Secret Service...

187
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:42,285
...Russian Embassy.

188
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:46,360
They'll have daily progress reports,
9:00 p.m. Every evening, this office.

189
00:21:47,447 --> 00:21:49,483
Major Koslova, anything else?

190
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:54,357
Since 1983, KGB provided funding
for five direct-action missions:

191
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,445
One bombing and four assassinations
by gunshot.

192
00:21:57,527 --> 00:21:59,597
The Jackal was the operative used.

193
00:22:00,207 --> 00:22:02,562
Not giving me much to work with, Preston.

194
00:22:02,647 --> 00:22:04,239
We don't have much, sir.

195
00:22:04,327 --> 00:22:06,921
Major Koslova's informers can't finger him.

196
00:22:07,287 --> 00:22:09,801
They don't know who he is,
CIA can't track him.

197
00:22:09,887 --> 00:22:11,479
Then what?

198
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:14,240
Using KGB files,
I've identified six operatives...

199
00:22:14,327 --> 00:22:16,363
...we believe to have actually seen him.

200
00:22:16,447 --> 00:22:20,281
Four are dead, one in Libya, but the last
is believed to be in the United States.

201
00:22:20,367 --> 00:22:23,677
A Basque separatist
name Isabella Celia Zancona.

202
00:22:23,767 --> 00:22:25,883
She might know what he looks like.

203
00:22:25,967 --> 00:22:29,562
- But we have no idea of her whereabouts.
- Someone must.

204
00:22:30,247 --> 00:22:32,920
Interpol says that in the '80s
she was involved with...

205
00:22:33,007 --> 00:22:35,680
...Declan Joseph Mulqueen,
an IRA sharpshooter.

206
00:22:35,767 --> 00:22:40,158
He burned out. They decided to get him
out of Ireland, shipped him here.

207
00:22:40,247 --> 00:22:44,286
In '89, he picked up twice 25 years
for some old weapons trafficking charges.

208
00:22:44,367 --> 00:22:48,042
He's serving time at a maximum-security
state pen in Massachusetts.

209
00:22:48,127 --> 00:22:52,200
Say he does know where she is.
What makes you think he'll talk to you?

210
00:22:52,327 --> 00:22:55,524
I'm hoping he'll cooperate
for a reduced sentence.

211
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:59,316
Don't promise too much.
After all, he's a terrorist.

212
00:23:15,647 --> 00:23:17,922
You got some visitors, Mulqueen.

213
00:23:24,687 --> 00:23:27,724
What do you want with Isabella?
She's done nothing here.

214
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:30,116
She entered the country illegally.

215
00:23:32,487 --> 00:23:37,515
What? The FBI's sending
deputy directors out after illegal aliens?

216
00:23:39,487 --> 00:23:42,126
Give over, Preston.
Who you really looking for?

217
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:45,484
A pro. Calls himself "The Jackal."

218
00:23:47,087 --> 00:23:48,839
That fellow.

219
00:23:50,247 --> 00:23:51,805
The mystery man.

220
00:23:52,687 --> 00:23:55,679
We think she may be able
to help us find him.

221
00:23:55,807 --> 00:23:57,957
If so, we'll arrange a pardon for her...

222
00:23:58,047 --> 00:24:00,356
...signed by the President of the US.

223
00:24:00,447 --> 00:24:03,996
And guarantee no extradition. We'd also
guarantee the Spanish government...

224
00:24:04,087 --> 00:24:07,716
...will never know her whereabouts.
- They don't know now, do they?

225
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:09,845
And neither do you.

226
00:24:09,927 --> 00:24:11,758
Let's keep it that way.

227
00:24:20,047 --> 00:24:22,766
Would it matter that you might be
saving a human life?

228
00:24:22,847 --> 00:24:26,203
And whose human life
would be important enough for all this?

229
00:24:26,407 --> 00:24:29,365
Mr. Donald Brown, Director of the FBI.

230
00:24:31,647 --> 00:24:33,444
Wouldn't that be droll?

231
00:24:35,847 --> 00:24:38,805
We know that gang elements
in this prison want you dead.

232
00:24:38,887 --> 00:24:41,526
The entire government
wants me dead, mister.

233
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:44,997
- Yet here I am.
- All right, smart ass, let's cut the bullshit.

234
00:24:45,327 --> 00:24:48,922
You cooperate and we'll get you
transferred to a minimum-security facility.

235
00:24:49,007 --> 00:24:50,565
That's our deal.

236
00:24:50,647 --> 00:24:53,798
And that's your only chance
to walk out of this place in one piece.

237
00:24:53,887 --> 00:24:56,799
That's a one-time offer.
Now take it or leave it.

238
00:24:57,207 --> 00:25:00,005
Stuff it then,
as many fucking times as you like.

239
00:25:00,407 --> 00:25:02,875
Pardon the language. I've been in prison.

240
00:25:15,407 --> 00:25:18,638
All right, what will it take
for you to help us?

241
00:25:20,647 --> 00:25:23,957
First, I'd have to be convinced
Isabella would be kept safe.

242
00:25:24,087 --> 00:25:25,600
Done.

243
00:25:26,407 --> 00:25:27,920
Then you'd have to let me go.

244
00:25:28,007 --> 00:25:30,316
Back to Ireland, a free man.

245
00:25:30,727 --> 00:25:32,763
Out of the question.

246
00:25:34,327 --> 00:25:37,797
Besides gunrunning, you're a known killer
of British government personnel.

247
00:25:37,887 --> 00:25:40,321
And all the women
and children you've blown up.

248
00:25:40,407 --> 00:25:43,479
It's not my war. I was never a bomber.

249
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:46,445
I don't see the distinction.
You still took human lives.

250
00:25:46,527 --> 00:25:50,236
The distinction is I killed in a war.
Now I want to go home. Simple as that.

251
00:25:50,327 --> 00:25:51,601
Simple for you, perhaps.

252
00:25:51,687 --> 00:25:54,804
Even in Russia, soldiers go home
when the treaty's signed, nyet?

253
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,526
That's not gonna happen. Sorry.

254
00:26:00,007 --> 00:26:02,157
All right, just the chance then.

255
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:06,002
Your best efforts to get me free.

256
00:26:06,727 --> 00:26:08,718
I'll settle for your word on it.

257
00:26:10,447 --> 00:26:12,438
Sorry.

258
00:26:15,527 --> 00:26:18,041
So the Jackal's after your director, is he?

259
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,397
Tell him to get his affairs in order...

260
00:26:20,487 --> 00:26:22,159
...because nobody can save him now.

261
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,557
Nobody except me. Because I met him.

262
00:26:29,767 --> 00:26:31,883
Yeah, didn't I mention it?

263
00:26:43,367 --> 00:26:47,121
I can identify him by his face,
given the opportunity...

264
00:26:47,407 --> 00:26:49,477
...but more importantly, by his methods.

265
00:26:51,607 --> 00:26:54,246
So you can leave Isabella out of this.

266
00:26:54,887 --> 00:26:56,684
Did you work with him?

267
00:26:56,767 --> 00:26:59,281
With him? No. No way.

268
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:04,037
Do you have a problem with this man?

269
00:27:06,007 --> 00:27:08,316
That's between him and me.

270
00:27:13,487 --> 00:27:16,763
Isabella Zancona
is the only confirmed contact we have...

271
00:27:16,847 --> 00:27:18,917
...and we will find her.

272
00:27:19,167 --> 00:27:21,681
With or without your help.

273
00:27:21,967 --> 00:27:23,764
Okay.

274
00:27:26,087 --> 00:27:29,045
I want three things.
One: Get me out of here.

275
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:33,001
- I'm no use to you sitting here on my ass.
- What's to keep you from taking off?

276
00:27:33,087 --> 00:27:34,918
Nothing.

277
00:27:35,247 --> 00:27:37,078
Except I give you my word.

278
00:27:38,487 --> 00:27:41,559
Two: I go with you to meet Isabella.

279
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:43,845
Why?

280
00:27:44,647 --> 00:27:46,683
I want to see her, is all.

281
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:52,123
And the third thing?

282
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:55,278
A decent razor.

283
00:27:59,487 --> 00:28:01,125
Here's how it'll go, Mulqueen.

284
00:28:01,207 --> 00:28:04,597
You will be searched on a random
schedule. If we turn up a paper clip...

285
00:28:04,687 --> 00:28:08,726
...that hasn't been authorized, I'll send
you back. Same for using the phone.

286
00:28:08,807 --> 00:28:11,924
- What? You don't trust me?
- As far as I can throw you.

287
00:28:12,007 --> 00:28:13,884
But I have little choice.

288
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:16,879
If you've got any thoughts
about an IRA snatch...

289
00:28:17,007 --> 00:28:18,998
...we'll shoot to kill, them and you.

290
00:28:19,087 --> 00:28:21,965
And not necessarily in that order.
Understand?

291
00:28:22,047 --> 00:28:23,878
I heard you.

292
00:28:24,207 --> 00:28:26,846
Go along and we'll get along.

293
00:28:36,087 --> 00:28:38,317
I'm gonna keep a real good eye on you.

294
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:44,724
Miss Koslova, is it?

295
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,763
What would your first name be then?

296
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,165
Major.

297
00:28:56,887 --> 00:28:59,037
Major Koslova.

298
00:29:05,767 --> 00:29:07,837
A wee bit rusty, that's all.

299
00:29:23,047 --> 00:29:26,198
Subassembly of titanium,
as light as the stresses will allow.

300
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:29,476
The arm's got to traverse 270 degrees.

301
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:32,286
Feed and drive mechanisms
run on 210 amp servos.

302
00:29:32,367 --> 00:29:35,120
The whole thing's has to run off 12-volt DC.

303
00:29:35,767 --> 00:29:37,883
Yeah, it's a car battery. That's cool.

304
00:29:37,967 --> 00:29:41,721
- How much weight is the arm supporting?
- Fifty-five kilograms.

305
00:29:41,887 --> 00:29:44,799
It's a big fucker, yeah?

306
00:29:45,047 --> 00:29:46,719
Hey, you want one?

307
00:29:46,807 --> 00:29:48,160
No.

308
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:51,476
I'm gonna want this in eight days.

309
00:29:51,767 --> 00:29:53,280
I can do that.

310
00:29:55,087 --> 00:29:56,600
How much?

311
00:29:58,647 --> 00:30:00,877
Well, the titanium's gonna be a problem.

312
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:04,960
It's a listed material up here.
It's gonna take time, a little more money.

313
00:30:05,647 --> 00:30:07,399
$50,000?

314
00:30:10,967 --> 00:30:14,926
I mean, like, $40,000.

315
00:30:17,767 --> 00:30:20,076
All right. Half now, half on delivery.

316
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:24,365
This sucker's definitely
gonna kick some ass, yeah?

317
00:30:26,887 --> 00:30:28,400
Get this straight.

318
00:30:28,607 --> 00:30:32,156
When you finish this unit, you'll turn over
the plans and scrap material.

319
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:36,035
You'll forget about Charlie Murdock
and the tech specs on these plans.

320
00:30:36,727 --> 00:30:38,797
Shit, man, I'm cool.

321
00:30:38,887 --> 00:30:40,764
Relax.

322
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:44,479
All right.

323
00:31:12,967 --> 00:31:14,639
Are you nervous?

324
00:31:17,567 --> 00:31:20,843
Eight years. That's a lifetime, isn't it?

325
00:31:22,967 --> 00:31:24,559
Hello.

326
00:31:25,127 --> 00:31:27,038
- Mr. Decker, is it?
- Yes.

327
00:31:27,127 --> 00:31:29,925
Hello there. I'm Declan Mulqueen.

328
00:31:30,087 --> 00:31:33,204
This is Major Koslova.

329
00:31:33,287 --> 00:31:35,198
- How do you do?
- Hi.

330
00:31:35,647 --> 00:31:37,638
We'd like to speak to your wife.

331
00:31:39,207 --> 00:31:41,516
Someone to see you.

332
00:32:18,127 --> 00:32:20,402
I'll take the kids out back.

333
00:32:25,047 --> 00:32:27,163
My beautiful Irish...

334
00:32:40,007 --> 00:32:42,282
They let me out to ask you something.

335
00:32:43,847 --> 00:32:47,726
Sir, I was thinking maybe we could
use the Zancona woman as insurance...

336
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,441
...in case Mulqueen gets happy feet.
- Listen...

337
00:32:50,527 --> 00:32:52,563
...however he plays it, we play it straight.

338
00:32:52,647 --> 00:32:55,844
Isabella Zancona's involvement
remains classified.

339
00:32:56,287 --> 00:32:58,562
That means nothing in the report.

340
00:32:58,767 --> 00:33:01,406
No name, no location, nothing. Got it?

341
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:03,121
Yes, sir.

342
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:10,087
I never knew his name,
but he was definitely American.

343
00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:12,522
He had some kind
of special military training...

344
00:33:12,607 --> 00:33:15,519
...where he learned Spanish,
in El Salvador, I think.

345
00:33:15,807 --> 00:33:18,082
I didn't like talking to him.

346
00:33:18,167 --> 00:33:21,125
I suppose we were all dangerous people...

347
00:33:21,447 --> 00:33:23,722
...but he was different.

348
00:33:23,887 --> 00:33:27,402
Declan was fire, all passion.
He had a cause.

349
00:33:27,567 --> 00:33:31,003
This man was ice. No feeling, nothing.

350
00:33:31,567 --> 00:33:34,604
Okay. Thank you, Mrs. Decker.
You've been very helpful.

351
00:33:35,127 --> 00:33:39,678
It's best if you keep our conversation
confidential, even from your husband.

352
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,524
Don't worry about George.

353
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:46,243
He doesn't know anything
about my past and he doesn't want to.

354
00:33:46,327 --> 00:33:49,444
All he needs to know is that I love him.

355
00:33:52,727 --> 00:33:54,126
I see.

356
00:33:55,527 --> 00:33:57,279
I thank you again.

357
00:33:58,287 --> 00:34:00,164
I'll wait for you in the car.

358
00:34:07,767 --> 00:34:10,998
This opens a locker
at Norfolk Greyhound Terminal.

359
00:34:11,447 --> 00:34:15,042
Inside is a clean passport and $10,000 cash.

360
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:18,718
Your friends left it with me
in case you ever showed up.

361
00:34:19,287 --> 00:34:22,404
Take it and go back to Ireland.

362
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:24,600
I can't.

363
00:34:25,047 --> 00:34:26,639
What?

364
00:34:28,007 --> 00:34:30,157
You gave your word?

365
00:34:32,207 --> 00:34:33,845
Go now.

366
00:34:33,927 --> 00:34:37,078
Once he kills whoever he's after,
they'll send you back to prison.

367
00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:39,556
When I believe that, I'll use the key.

368
00:34:52,607 --> 00:34:54,438
Are you happy at least?

369
00:34:54,527 --> 00:34:57,485
Yes. I love my children.

370
00:34:58,967 --> 00:35:02,243
And my husband, in my way, I mean.

371
00:35:11,487 --> 00:35:15,799
Some nights I can close my eyes
and sleep...

372
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,967
...and no dead faces come to wake me.

373
00:35:21,447 --> 00:35:23,756
That's more than I ever had.

374
00:35:26,367 --> 00:35:28,927
You wouldn't have me give that up,
would you?

375
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:35,076
Give me some credit, will you?

376
00:36:06,607 --> 00:36:08,837
She's Basque, isn't she?

377
00:36:10,327 --> 00:36:11,680
Aye.

378
00:36:12,247 --> 00:36:14,681
They say Basques live by the vendetta.

379
00:36:15,287 --> 00:36:17,676
If they hate someone, it's to the death.

380
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:20,042
It's the same way when they love.

381
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:25,556
My first name is Valentina.

382
00:36:31,967 --> 00:36:33,923
You have family in Russia?

383
00:36:34,007 --> 00:36:36,919
My parents. My brother, in the navy.

384
00:36:37,007 --> 00:36:38,998
Husband? Kids?

385
00:36:39,407 --> 00:36:42,319
No. I have not found the time.

386
00:36:46,367 --> 00:36:50,121
In truth, it's never been a conflict for me.

387
00:36:50,327 --> 00:36:53,239
This is not a quality
a man looks for in a woman.

388
00:37:01,047 --> 00:37:02,275
By the way...

389
00:37:02,367 --> 00:37:04,961
...whatever Isabella gave you after I left...

390
00:37:05,207 --> 00:37:09,086
...I trust you won't use it
until after our business is concluded.

391
00:37:10,487 --> 00:37:12,364
Don't miss a thing, do you?

392
00:37:12,447 --> 00:37:14,403
No, Mr. Mulqueen.

393
00:37:15,127 --> 00:37:16,924
I see everything.

394
00:37:26,647 --> 00:37:29,684
Maybe we should start
by canceling your public appearances.

395
00:37:29,767 --> 00:37:32,440
No, I don't think that's necessary.
I mean, not yet.

396
00:37:32,527 --> 00:37:35,917
This fellow's gonna need to
make preparations. He'll need time.

397
00:37:36,007 --> 00:37:39,204
- How tight are the borders?
- Mexico and Canada have...

398
00:37:40,167 --> 00:37:43,762
Mr. Mulqueen?
Something you'd like to share?

399
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:47,276
He'll likely be using four false identities.

400
00:37:47,367 --> 00:37:50,484
Three will be on him, and one
in reserve at a drop box somewhere.

401
00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:53,525
- That's the way he used to operate.
- What matter if he has 40?

402
00:37:53,607 --> 00:37:57,680
It's still one man. Might we not
be creating a storm in a tea cup?

403
00:37:57,767 --> 00:38:00,486
Exactly. I agree with you 100 percent.

404
00:38:01,527 --> 00:38:03,643
Director Bolitonov.

405
00:38:03,807 --> 00:38:07,402
Terek has always made
doing his own killing a point of honor.

406
00:38:07,607 --> 00:38:09,723
Usually very bloody and very public.

407
00:38:09,807 --> 00:38:11,763
A statement, if you will.

408
00:38:12,047 --> 00:38:14,515
So, if he's hired an outsider...

409
00:38:14,687 --> 00:38:17,724
...obviously, this is something
he takes very seriously.

410
00:38:17,807 --> 00:38:20,037
Until this Jackal is captured or killed...

411
00:38:20,127 --> 00:38:22,197
...I don't think we can afford to do any less.

412
00:38:22,287 --> 00:38:25,563
Come on. Let's get real here. It's one guy.

413
00:38:25,687 --> 00:38:28,360
It's just one guy. Bolitonov's right.

414
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:31,485
With the assets in this room,
the guy's as good as got.

415
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:33,797
That's if he doesn't blow it first...

416
00:38:33,887 --> 00:38:37,880
...like a lot of these clowns.
Remember that guy? What was his name?

417
00:38:39,327 --> 00:38:41,045
What's that, Mr. Mulqueen?

418
00:38:42,007 --> 00:38:45,079
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown,
but this man is no clown.

419
00:38:45,287 --> 00:38:47,596
He knows all your moves, back to front.

420
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:50,636
Right now, you got a name.
That's all you got.

421
00:38:50,727 --> 00:38:53,924
The Jackal's got a target: You.
He's got a timetable.

422
00:38:54,007 --> 00:38:57,886
As to making mistakes, he's spent 20 years
in a trade that doesn't forgive error.

423
00:38:57,967 --> 00:39:00,003
And he's prevailed.

424
00:39:01,007 --> 00:39:03,475
You think he's the one
who is up against us?

425
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:05,438
It's the other way around.

426
00:40:03,847 --> 00:40:05,678
- Hi.
- Hi.

427
00:40:07,247 --> 00:40:10,398
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Yeah.

428
00:40:22,967 --> 00:40:25,197
I think you should come home with me.

429
00:40:26,887 --> 00:40:28,479
I'd love to...

430
00:40:29,407 --> 00:40:31,238
...but I can't.

431
00:40:31,407 --> 00:40:33,159
I have to go back to Atlanta...

432
00:40:33,247 --> 00:40:35,886
...to finalize my very messy divorce.

433
00:40:38,247 --> 00:40:39,965
Does she know?

434
00:40:40,047 --> 00:40:41,878
She does now.

435
00:40:45,087 --> 00:40:46,918
So how am I gonna see you again?

436
00:40:47,007 --> 00:40:49,396
You could give me one of your cards.

437
00:40:55,727 --> 00:40:57,558
You're not gonna call.

438
00:40:57,727 --> 00:40:59,399
Douglas.

439
00:41:01,647 --> 00:41:05,037
You just have to have
a little faith in people, that's all.

440
00:41:05,367 --> 00:41:07,244
Like I do.

441
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:19,045
Open your shirt.

442
00:42:21,367 --> 00:42:23,722
- Easy now. Easy.
- Now!

443
00:42:26,807 --> 00:42:28,525
Easy.

444
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:30,765
Open your shirt.

445
00:42:30,847 --> 00:42:32,565
Easy now.

446
00:42:39,367 --> 00:42:42,006
Souvenirs of British hospitality.

447
00:42:47,447 --> 00:42:49,244
I apologize.

448
00:42:52,607 --> 00:42:53,801
No problem.

449
00:42:53,887 --> 00:42:58,119
Oslo Travel came up with a James William
Hayslip who flew from Toronto...

450
00:42:58,207 --> 00:43:00,846
...August 25, two days before
the meeting with Terek.

451
00:43:00,927 --> 00:43:05,159
We checked the Social Security number
on his passport, and guess what?

452
00:43:06,327 --> 00:43:11,003
It belongs to an inmate committed to a
mental institution in Virginia 12 years ago.

453
00:43:12,207 --> 00:43:14,562
Now, Canadian Travel says he flew...

454
00:43:14,647 --> 00:43:17,844
...to Montreal nine days ago.

455
00:44:03,567 --> 00:44:04,556
Hello?

456
00:44:05,927 --> 00:44:06,916
Hello?

457
00:44:07,007 --> 00:44:09,157
- Yeah?
- Yeah, Charlie Murdock.

458
00:44:09,407 --> 00:44:12,319
Picking up a delivery, eh?

459
00:44:13,287 --> 00:44:15,118
Invoice.

460
00:44:15,407 --> 00:44:17,125
Yes.

461
00:44:17,207 --> 00:44:19,801
- It's a hot one, eh?
- You can say that again.

462
00:45:20,087 --> 00:45:23,363
Hi. I need to use one of your computers.

463
00:45:24,127 --> 00:45:25,958
Sure. Any one.

464
00:45:30,367 --> 00:45:32,278
Can I get on line with this?

465
00:45:32,367 --> 00:45:34,198
Yeah, sure.

466
00:48:13,407 --> 00:48:15,523
Go check upstairs.

467
00:49:42,807 --> 00:49:44,638
Thank you.

468
00:49:45,047 --> 00:49:46,958
Hayslip's disappeared.

469
00:49:47,047 --> 00:49:50,517
Border Patrol has the passport photo,
but nothing's shown up yet.

470
00:49:50,607 --> 00:49:54,043
- He's moved on. I told you.
- One moment.

471
00:49:54,287 --> 00:49:57,006
The only place we're sure
he's been is Montreal.

472
00:49:57,247 --> 00:50:00,557
What if he started using
the next identity there?

473
00:50:01,047 --> 00:50:02,480
I'm not following you.

474
00:50:02,567 --> 00:50:05,320
Hayslip disappeared,
that doesn't mean the Jackal did.

475
00:50:05,407 --> 00:50:07,363
Perhaps something has happened.

476
00:50:08,807 --> 00:50:12,766
Witherspoon, have the Montreal police
check their logs for the last 48 hours.

477
00:50:12,847 --> 00:50:15,600
If he's on to the next name,
it's because it's in the plan.

478
00:50:15,687 --> 00:50:17,882
- A man like this doesn't make mistakes.
- No?

479
00:50:17,967 --> 00:50:20,435
They always make one, somewhere.

480
00:50:20,687 --> 00:50:22,917
Isn't that how you were caught?

481
00:50:33,887 --> 00:50:35,843
What's her story, then?

482
00:50:36,527 --> 00:50:38,324
Major Koslova...

483
00:50:38,847 --> 00:50:41,964
...ends the debate about
women in combat, as far as I'm concerned.

484
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:43,400
How's that?

485
00:50:44,327 --> 00:50:47,399
When she saved my life
and took out Terek's brother...

486
00:50:47,967 --> 00:50:52,119
...she did it knowing she'd be drawing
a death sentence down on her own neck.

487
00:50:52,247 --> 00:50:56,763
But when we offered to set her up
someplace else when this is over...

488
00:50:56,847 --> 00:50:59,122
...you know what she said?

489
00:50:59,847 --> 00:51:02,645
"The good guys don't hide."

490
00:51:05,407 --> 00:51:07,284
Fierce woman.

491
00:51:07,447 --> 00:51:10,757
In that country, under that system...

492
00:51:11,807 --> 00:51:13,684
Staggering.

493
00:51:16,887 --> 00:51:19,924
Oh, shit, you know what?
I couldn't get titanium.

494
00:51:20,007 --> 00:51:23,044
So, I had a friend mold the base
out of carbon fiber instead.

495
00:51:23,127 --> 00:51:26,085
Came in 23 kilos
under the weight you asked for.

496
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:28,317
- Is that cool?
- Yeah, that's great.

497
00:51:28,927 --> 00:51:32,761
I'm still gonna want the plans, the mold
and the scrap material. Remember?

498
00:51:32,847 --> 00:51:35,077
Yeah.

499
00:51:36,647 --> 00:51:39,445
- Maybe we ought to talk about that.
- Oh?

500
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:46,884
This rig, I figure it's to support
something pretty heavy, right?

501
00:51:47,287 --> 00:51:50,802
Like a Gatling gun, maybe?

502
00:51:51,687 --> 00:51:54,281
Or a 20-millimeter cannon?

503
00:51:54,367 --> 00:51:56,562
You must be shooting
at something pretty big.

504
00:51:56,647 --> 00:51:58,524
Armored car, maybe?

505
00:51:59,687 --> 00:52:01,086
Bank vault?

506
00:52:01,167 --> 00:52:05,240
I don't know. You could be shooting
a fucking airliner for all I know.

507
00:52:05,447 --> 00:52:07,483
But the point is...

508
00:52:07,887 --> 00:52:11,357
...a job like this
can attract a lot of attention.

509
00:52:13,007 --> 00:52:14,599
I don't want any attention.

510
00:52:14,687 --> 00:52:17,121
Right, right. That's why I'm saying...

511
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:20,639
...I think the plans
and mold are worth a little bonus.

512
00:52:21,927 --> 00:52:23,918
- How much?
- I don't know.

513
00:52:25,247 --> 00:52:26,965
$100,000?

514
00:52:29,207 --> 00:52:33,280
Come on, man. You know it's worth it.
You got a serious piece of equipment.

515
00:52:42,287 --> 00:52:44,198
All right.

516
00:52:44,967 --> 00:52:46,923
I'll get you $50,000 tomorrow.

517
00:52:47,567 --> 00:52:51,355
I'm gonna need a place to test this.
Someplace that won't draw any attention.

518
00:52:51,447 --> 00:52:54,757
We got a place like that.
We got a place just like that.

519
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:14,399
Target's in place.
Man, I should have brought some beer.

520
00:53:19,527 --> 00:53:22,758
Motherfuckin' motherfucker.

521
00:53:23,647 --> 00:53:27,481
That motherfucker is state of the art!

522
00:53:28,087 --> 00:53:32,399
I knew it was gonna be big. I didn't know
it was gonna be the prototype cannon.

523
00:53:32,607 --> 00:53:35,075
It's a fucking mole.

524
00:53:36,487 --> 00:53:39,524
- Some hairy-Iooking rounds.
- Made from depleted uranium.

525
00:53:39,607 --> 00:53:41,279
It'll go through anything.

526
00:53:41,367 --> 00:53:43,517
Once they get inside, they just spall.

527
00:53:43,607 --> 00:53:45,643
Hell, yeah. They spall?

528
00:53:46,207 --> 00:53:48,767
They get in there, and they just...

529
00:53:49,607 --> 00:53:50,756
That rocks.

530
00:53:50,847 --> 00:53:53,407
- Look at the lens on that thing.
- Don't touch that.

531
00:53:53,487 --> 00:53:56,285
It's got, like, a 2,000-mile zoom lens.

532
00:53:56,847 --> 00:53:58,599
That thing is kick-ass.

533
00:53:59,087 --> 00:54:01,521
Dude, is this thing a prototype, or what?

534
00:54:01,967 --> 00:54:05,039
I bet you it cost you a shitload.
That rocks.

535
00:54:06,167 --> 00:54:07,566
Man, you rock.

536
00:54:07,647 --> 00:54:09,763
Do you know what I'm saying?

537
00:54:09,847 --> 00:54:11,997
Rock!

538
00:54:14,127 --> 00:54:16,243
Fucking thing kicks ass.

539
00:54:28,567 --> 00:54:31,001
Bring on the spall, baby.

540
00:54:31,527 --> 00:54:33,836
- I can't wait to see the fuck...
- Lamont.

541
00:54:34,847 --> 00:54:36,519
Close your mouth.

542
00:54:49,167 --> 00:54:51,362
Smooth action, yeah?

543
00:55:11,527 --> 00:55:13,085
Ready?

544
00:55:19,007 --> 00:55:22,044
Yeah! Spall!

545
00:55:29,087 --> 00:55:30,440
Well, at least...

546
00:55:31,207 --> 00:55:33,721
...it took out the target.
- No, it's off...

547
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:36,158
...by at least three millimeters.

548
00:55:36,247 --> 00:55:39,205
No, dude. That's precision craftsmanship.

549
00:55:39,447 --> 00:55:42,086
- It isn't off by three millimeters.
- So, Lamont...

550
00:55:43,607 --> 00:55:46,485
...tell me how you sight
in this thing automatically.

551
00:55:46,567 --> 00:55:50,003
Punch in the windage and
the elevation you want and hit enter.

552
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:54,235
- So you just kind of guestimate it, huh?
- Basically guestimation.

553
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:58,279
And hit enter.

554
00:56:03,847 --> 00:56:05,678
I give up!

555
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:09,756
- I guess the automatic sighting works.
- Yeah.

556
00:56:09,847 --> 00:56:13,123
- I thought I was about to sprawl.
- Well, Lamont...

557
00:56:13,207 --> 00:56:16,085
...gonna have to speed-test it now.
- Speed test.

558
00:56:16,727 --> 00:56:18,797
So, run.

559
00:56:24,127 --> 00:56:25,924
What do you mean?

560
00:56:26,927 --> 00:56:30,044
I mean run, now.

561
00:56:44,607 --> 00:56:46,438
Run to your right!

562
00:57:14,007 --> 00:57:15,918
Get up!

563
00:57:18,327 --> 00:57:20,887
All right, good! Stop there!

564
00:57:22,327 --> 00:57:24,158
Just stop there!

565
00:57:24,447 --> 00:57:26,324
Turn around!

566
00:57:27,327 --> 00:57:29,522
Hold out that pack of cigarettes!

567
00:57:32,967 --> 00:57:35,003
Don't be afraid!

568
00:57:40,647 --> 00:57:42,638
Stand very still!

569
00:57:52,487 --> 00:57:54,364
Stand still!

570
00:58:09,927 --> 00:58:12,077
I told you it was off.

571
00:58:14,527 --> 00:58:16,961
Move over by the car!

572
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:20,087
Quick, before you pass out!

573
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,800
Here we go, sir. Major. Mac.

574
00:59:14,207 --> 00:59:18,485
Eleven days ago, Charles C. Murdock
bought himself a new Dodge minivan.

575
00:59:20,087 --> 00:59:22,317
That was a big surprise to Mr. Murdock...

576
00:59:22,407 --> 00:59:26,480
...whose passport and wallet were stolen
16 days ago at the Helsinki airport.

577
00:59:26,567 --> 00:59:27,886
Anything from the border?

578
00:59:27,967 --> 00:59:30,765
We sent a description of the van
from here to Manitoba.

579
00:59:30,847 --> 00:59:34,920
I have something. Uphall Station.
It's a small town outside Ottawa.

580
00:59:35,007 --> 00:59:37,805
- I think your man has been there.
- Let's go.

581
00:59:53,127 --> 00:59:56,085
The owner is lan Lamont, small-time hood.

582
00:59:56,207 --> 00:59:58,437
The coroner has what's left of him
at Broxburn.

583
00:59:58,527 --> 01:00:00,995
We get the idea. Let's get to the shop.

584
01:00:10,287 --> 01:00:12,562
Hello. Think I got something here.

585
01:00:18,607 --> 01:00:20,325
What is it?

586
01:00:20,687 --> 01:00:22,564
This is a remote firing station.

587
01:00:22,647 --> 01:00:24,478
See, it maneuvers a weapon.

588
01:00:24,567 --> 01:00:28,526
The servos run off a remote control,
like a model airplane.

589
01:00:28,647 --> 01:00:31,115
We used to make these things
for mortars or...

590
01:00:31,207 --> 01:00:34,119
...such but nothing like this size.

591
01:00:34,527 --> 01:00:36,438
He needs a van just to move it around.

592
01:00:36,527 --> 01:00:38,836
What would something this size
be used for?

593
01:00:38,927 --> 01:00:41,566
- Antiaircraft?
- No, you can buy a mount for that.

594
01:00:41,647 --> 01:00:44,161
A missile's the best thing for an aircraft.

595
01:00:44,767 --> 01:00:48,965
- No, this is for something else entirely.
- Something with one hell of a range.

596
01:00:49,087 --> 01:00:51,078
Not just the range, though.

597
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:53,795
See, if it is a gun, it's the cyclic rate.

598
01:00:54,407 --> 01:00:58,559
You can send off a hundred bullets
before the first one ever hits the target.

599
01:01:02,967 --> 01:01:05,162
Good thing about a boat like this
is it sells itself.

600
01:01:05,247 --> 01:01:08,398
It's a hell of a lot of boat for the money.
It's got radar...

601
01:01:08,487 --> 01:01:12,480
...GPS, autopilot, auto-furling.
You can take this baby out by yourself.

602
01:01:14,007 --> 01:01:18,046
This has even got a cellular phone.
You can call your wife if you want to.

603
01:01:19,127 --> 01:01:21,322
So, what do you think?

604
01:01:21,847 --> 01:01:23,917
"Deja Vu."

605
01:01:26,687 --> 01:01:28,564
She's perfect.

606
01:03:08,567 --> 01:03:10,080
- Yes?
- Jackal.

607
01:03:10,167 --> 01:03:11,805
They know about Hayslip.

608
01:03:11,887 --> 01:03:16,005
They know you were in Canada,
and they have an Irishman helping them.

609
01:03:16,087 --> 01:03:18,647
- Irishman's name?
- Mulqueen.

610
01:03:20,207 --> 01:03:23,005
- Declan Mulqueen?
- Declan Mulqueen.

611
01:03:26,087 --> 01:03:28,078
The operation's still a go.

612
01:03:31,087 --> 01:03:32,076
Declan.

613
01:03:32,167 --> 01:03:36,285
Every crossing point and airport has
his photograph, but RCMP has nothing.

614
01:03:36,367 --> 01:03:39,404
Our Border Patrol,
the INS are both on the highest alert.

615
01:03:39,487 --> 01:03:40,966
Again, nothing.

616
01:03:41,047 --> 01:03:44,596
Let's face it, you don't have to be Houdini
to make it across from Canada.

617
01:03:44,687 --> 01:03:48,475
- He probably walked across.
- He won't be walking, I can tell you that.

618
01:03:48,727 --> 01:03:50,285
He's got a weapon to move.

619
01:03:50,567 --> 01:03:53,798
- What kind of patrols do you have here?
- The Great Lakes?

620
01:03:53,887 --> 01:03:55,639
Not a lot. No need.

621
01:03:55,727 --> 01:03:57,558
People either drive or fly.

622
01:03:57,847 --> 01:04:01,396
There are a few ferry services,
but we checked those out as well.

623
01:04:01,807 --> 01:04:03,525
What about people with boats?

624
01:04:03,607 --> 01:04:05,802
What kind of immigration controls
do you have?

625
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:08,845
Arriving vessels have to
check with the harbormaster.

626
01:04:08,927 --> 01:04:12,476
- Voluntarily?
- Yeah. No active enforcement.

627
01:04:14,567 --> 01:04:17,877
Say he does use a boat,
he'll still want to mix with others.

628
01:04:18,807 --> 01:04:21,037
Are there many gatherings to speak of?

629
01:04:21,327 --> 01:04:23,443
Yeah, the Mackinaw Regatta
is going on now.

630
01:04:23,527 --> 01:04:26,724
- It's the biggest regatta on Lake Michigan.
- From where to where?

631
01:04:26,807 --> 01:04:30,436
It starts in Mackinaw
and it ends in Chicago.

632
01:05:35,927 --> 01:05:38,646
Witherspoon, take Waveland.

633
01:05:38,727 --> 01:05:41,116
Declan, Valentina: Chicago Yacht Club.

634
01:05:41,367 --> 01:05:43,642
I'll take the locals. And remember...

635
01:05:43,727 --> 01:05:47,766
...it'll be an Ontario boat if it's here.
Look at everything and stay on your radios.

636
01:05:47,847 --> 01:05:51,920
If you do find something, call in backup.
I want an arrest, not a firefight.

637
01:05:57,127 --> 01:05:59,163
All right, let's get to it.

638
01:06:01,167 --> 01:06:04,239
Preston, what about
letting me have a gun?

639
01:06:05,007 --> 01:06:06,406
Are you crazy?

640
01:06:06,487 --> 01:06:11,561
If the right people knew I was letting you
walk around I'd get forced retirement.

641
01:06:13,567 --> 01:06:15,478
No fucking gun.

642
01:06:19,167 --> 01:06:22,557
- So many people.
- So many rich people.

643
01:06:22,727 --> 01:06:24,365
Shall we dance?

644
01:06:25,247 --> 01:06:27,158
He wouldn't give me a gun.

645
01:07:21,487 --> 01:07:22,681
He is hot.

646
01:07:24,127 --> 01:07:26,118
He's mine. Back off.

647
01:07:29,927 --> 01:07:31,804
Hey, you want some champagne?

648
01:07:31,887 --> 01:07:34,481
- Come on. Join us.
- Maybe later.

649
01:07:34,567 --> 01:07:36,319
Join us.

650
01:09:18,687 --> 01:09:20,359
Declan!

651
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:53,166
Get out of the way!

652
01:10:15,207 --> 01:10:17,801
Preston, can I talk to you?

653
01:10:21,687 --> 01:10:23,678
Look, he saw me. He wasn't surprised.

654
01:10:23,767 --> 01:10:25,485
Like he was expecting me.

655
01:10:25,567 --> 01:10:27,842
One of your team
is playing for the other side.

656
01:10:27,927 --> 01:10:29,838
I can vouch for every man on this team.

657
01:10:29,927 --> 01:10:32,566
- You've got a traitor.
- This is not the IRA.

658
01:10:32,647 --> 01:10:35,366
- We don't get infiltrators.
- Somebody got to him.

659
01:10:36,487 --> 01:10:40,400
This is a manhunt, not your cause.
Don't make it personal.

660
01:10:40,967 --> 01:10:43,242
What do you fucking know?

661
01:10:52,247 --> 01:10:53,885
I'll tell you what I know.

662
01:10:53,967 --> 01:10:57,039
I know the Jackal set you up
in that arms deal in Libya.

663
01:10:57,287 --> 01:11:00,518
I know Isabella was wounded
when you walked into the trap.

664
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:03,646
I also know that it was
the business you had chosen.

665
01:11:03,727 --> 01:11:07,083
Did you also know that Isabella
was pregnant when she got shot?

666
01:11:07,167 --> 01:11:09,317
That our child didn't survive?

667
01:11:13,687 --> 01:11:16,440
Don't tell me it's not personal, Mr. Preston.

668
01:11:19,007 --> 01:11:21,760
I can't let you jeopardize us in a vendetta.

669
01:11:21,927 --> 01:11:23,758
There's no vendetta.

670
01:11:24,167 --> 01:11:27,239
All I hope for is a fresh start, you know?

671
01:11:33,087 --> 01:11:35,282
Maybe it'll happen.

672
01:13:01,687 --> 01:13:04,042
This was recorded at 1:00 a.m.

673
01:13:04,127 --> 01:13:07,403
It's a call to a number
in Brighton Beach, New York.

674
01:13:08,767 --> 01:13:09,995
Item four:

675
01:13:10,087 --> 01:13:13,841
At 1:05 p.m. Director Brown
is scheduled to meet the First Lady...

676
01:13:13,927 --> 01:13:16,077
...at a reception at the White House...

677
01:13:16,167 --> 01:13:18,601
...regarding the New Hope Hospital
opening.

678
01:13:18,687 --> 01:13:20,917
Other participants will be decided...

679
01:13:23,087 --> 01:13:25,396
That information came out of this room.

680
01:13:27,847 --> 01:13:30,759
Who? Whose voice is it on that tape?

681
01:13:37,407 --> 01:13:39,284
Mine.

682
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:44,765
Mr. Ambassador.

683
01:13:44,847 --> 01:13:47,361
We have arranged to hold
a flight to Moscow.

684
01:13:47,447 --> 01:13:50,678
A car is waiting to drive
Colonel Bolitonov to the airport.

685
01:14:06,887 --> 01:14:09,037
How did you know whose phone to tap?

686
01:14:09,127 --> 01:14:12,802
I didn't, so I tapped everybody's.

687
01:14:13,727 --> 01:14:16,719
But I have diplomatic immunity.

688
01:14:17,207 --> 01:14:19,767
Who authorized you to tap my telephone?

689
01:14:19,847 --> 01:14:21,360
I did, Ambassador.

690
01:14:21,447 --> 01:14:25,235
We're currently examining documents
taken from Bolitonov's apartment.

691
01:14:40,847 --> 01:14:42,678
Get me a helicopter.

692
01:15:08,887 --> 01:15:10,400
Jackal.

693
01:15:10,607 --> 01:15:14,361
Director Bolitonov
is no longer contactable at this number.

694
01:15:14,567 --> 01:15:16,842
All inquiries should be forwarded to...

695
01:15:22,447 --> 01:15:25,917
This is only a precaution for a short while,
until we get this man.

696
01:15:26,007 --> 01:15:28,316
You and your family
will be safer in Washington.

697
01:15:28,407 --> 01:15:30,762
You really think you'll find him?
You won't.

698
01:15:30,847 --> 01:15:33,919
- Believe me, you can't.
- It's our job to try.

699
01:15:34,007 --> 01:15:37,283
And waste your time
and maybe get killed for nothing?

700
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:41,000
I began this.

701
01:15:41,127 --> 01:15:45,086
I have to do what I can,
so please get your family away.

702
01:15:51,207 --> 01:15:52,686
Let's go.

703
01:16:08,447 --> 01:16:09,482
Everything okay?

704
01:16:09,567 --> 01:16:14,243
Valentina's evacuating Isabella and her
family in case he knows where she lives.

705
01:16:17,047 --> 01:16:19,880
Look, the director doesn't even know
where Isabella lives.

706
01:16:19,967 --> 01:16:23,960
I ordered Witherspoon to keep her
out of the report. No way Jackal knows.

707
01:16:24,367 --> 01:16:28,406
Well, our Russian black-heart surely passed
everything else to him, didn't he?

708
01:16:28,487 --> 01:16:30,239
Here, look.

709
01:16:32,447 --> 01:16:35,200
That's your phone number.
That's Valentina's.

710
01:16:35,287 --> 01:16:37,403
You know those two at the bottom?

711
01:16:40,567 --> 01:16:42,717
The first one's the Russian Embassy.

712
01:16:44,127 --> 01:16:46,004
The second one's...

713
01:16:48,367 --> 01:16:50,881
- Son of a bitch.
- What?

714
01:16:52,327 --> 01:16:55,000
This is an FBI access code.

715
01:17:00,247 --> 01:17:03,159
- FBI Data Center.
- This is Special Agent Carter Preston.

716
01:17:03,247 --> 01:17:07,001
- My authorization number is 223578-Kilo.
- Shit!

717
01:17:07,087 --> 01:17:11,603
I need a voice transcription of field report
November Alpha from 9-15 this year.

718
01:17:11,687 --> 01:17:15,362
Agent filing: Witherspoon, Timothy I.
And I'm in a hurry, operator.

719
01:17:19,727 --> 01:17:21,604
I shouldn't have trusted you.

720
01:17:24,167 --> 01:17:26,397
Field report November Alpha...

721
01:17:26,567 --> 01:17:29,206
...filed 9:00 a. M...
- Scroll.

722
01:17:29,407 --> 01:17:33,446
To perform interview of subject
Isabella Zancona at the following address...

723
01:17:33,527 --> 01:17:36,360
Witherspoon, you by-the-book asshole!

724
01:17:52,967 --> 01:17:54,798
I'm gonna check upstairs.

725
01:17:55,007 --> 01:17:56,918
Witherspoon?

726
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:23,085
Witherspoon?

727
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:34,045
Witherspoon?

728
01:18:47,847 --> 01:18:49,485
Come out!

729
01:18:50,087 --> 01:18:51,725
Please don't shoot me.

730
01:18:53,167 --> 01:18:54,998
Just taking out the garbage.

731
01:18:56,247 --> 01:18:58,158
- I got one more trip.
- Hurry.

732
01:18:58,247 --> 01:19:01,319
- We'll meet you at the front.
- Yes, ma'am.

733
01:19:09,287 --> 01:19:12,563
All locked up. Where's Witherspoon?

734
01:19:12,647 --> 01:19:15,115
He's in the backyard, taking out the trash.

735
01:19:17,647 --> 01:19:19,877
It's coming from the back. Let's go!

736
01:19:34,247 --> 01:19:36,966
- Where is it coming from?
- I don't know.

737
01:20:01,487 --> 01:20:03,637
Set to go off two minutes ago.

738
01:20:05,047 --> 01:20:06,958
What the hell?

739
01:20:08,567 --> 01:20:10,444
Where's McMurphy?

740
01:22:05,607 --> 01:22:09,316
Press here, hard. It'll slow the bleeding.

741
01:22:22,087 --> 01:22:24,317
See, that's bad.

742
01:22:24,887 --> 01:22:28,197
Blood's almost black.
That means the bullet's in your liver.

743
01:22:28,687 --> 01:22:30,757
You got about 20 minutes to live.

744
01:22:31,607 --> 01:22:34,758
If the pain gets too much,
you can take your hand away...

745
01:22:35,127 --> 01:22:38,278
...and you'll be dead in five minutes.

746
01:22:43,687 --> 01:22:47,680
When Declan kills you,
you think of me, okay?

747
01:22:53,207 --> 01:22:55,038
I'll make a note of that.

748
01:22:57,007 --> 01:22:58,679
If you see Declan...

749
01:22:58,767 --> 01:23:03,124
...before you die, you tell him
that he can't protect his women.

750
01:23:28,927 --> 01:23:31,487
They're all right. Let them through.

751
01:23:35,207 --> 01:23:36,879
Valentina?

752
01:23:41,247 --> 01:23:42,885
You'll be fine.

753
01:23:42,967 --> 01:23:44,923
- Yeah.
- Hi.

754
01:23:52,607 --> 01:23:55,167
It's all right, darling. You're gonna be fine.

755
01:23:55,327 --> 01:23:57,238
I tried...

756
01:23:58,127 --> 01:23:59,958
...to protect Isabella.

757
01:24:00,167 --> 01:24:02,522
I know. You did fine.

758
01:24:03,607 --> 01:24:06,280
He said to tell you...

759
01:24:07,087 --> 01:24:08,236
...say...

760
01:24:08,407 --> 01:24:12,525
..."You can't protect your women."

761
01:24:15,847 --> 01:24:17,678
Valentina.

762
01:24:18,207 --> 01:24:22,120
No, Valentina. No, don't. Valentina!

763
01:24:22,367 --> 01:24:25,040
Don't go. Stay with me.

764
01:25:19,687 --> 01:25:21,643
It was him, wasn't it?

765
01:25:22,527 --> 01:25:24,677
I thought this was all behind us.

766
01:25:26,207 --> 01:25:28,437
Is this ever gonna end?

767
01:25:29,567 --> 01:25:33,037
Yes. I promise you, it will end...

768
01:25:37,007 --> 01:25:38,918
...and I will end it.

769
01:25:43,807 --> 01:25:45,684
Do you have a gun?

770
01:26:02,807 --> 01:26:05,002
Following a low-light helicopter insertion...

771
01:26:05,087 --> 01:26:07,476
...a team could infiltrate the weapon here...

772
01:26:07,567 --> 01:26:10,400
...covering the northern approaches
and Route 1.

773
01:26:10,487 --> 01:26:14,321
If your weapon has nearly the range
and cyclic rate you're advertising...

774
01:26:14,487 --> 01:26:17,638
...it could engage
any ground vehicle and aircraft.

775
01:26:17,727 --> 01:26:22,005
He doesn't have a helicopter
or a team to help him set up.

776
01:26:22,087 --> 01:26:23,918
He's alone.

777
01:26:24,407 --> 01:26:26,045
What do you say, Mulqueen?

778
01:26:26,127 --> 01:26:29,915
Well, the only way he can make
the kill and escape is from a distance.

779
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:34,406
So we make sure you're
always secure indoors...

780
01:26:34,567 --> 01:26:37,286
...with a perimeter of men
outside your location.

781
01:26:37,367 --> 01:26:39,801
- And pick our battles?
- Exactly.

782
01:26:41,047 --> 01:26:43,117
Tying a noose, if you like.

783
01:26:43,727 --> 01:26:45,365
When he makes his move...

784
01:26:45,447 --> 01:26:47,915
...we tighten the noose and we hang him.

785
01:26:48,527 --> 01:26:50,802
Not exactly foolproof, I know...

786
01:26:50,887 --> 01:26:53,685
...but it's the best we got.
- The best we've got?

787
01:26:59,927 --> 01:27:02,646
- You have a call on line six.
- Thank you.

788
01:27:05,247 --> 01:27:07,681
- This is Doug.
- Told you I'd call.

789
01:27:08,087 --> 01:27:09,964
Hi. How are you?

790
01:27:10,047 --> 01:27:12,481
You've just have to have
a little faith in people.

791
01:27:14,727 --> 01:27:17,525
Okay. Well, okay.
Now that I've got faith...

792
01:27:17,607 --> 01:27:19,916
...are you busy tonight?
You're in town, yes?

793
01:27:39,527 --> 01:27:41,563
Hello?

794
01:27:43,687 --> 01:27:45,200
I'm home.

795
01:27:49,127 --> 01:27:50,799
I see you found the keys.

796
01:27:51,887 --> 01:27:53,639
Where are you?

797
01:27:53,967 --> 01:27:55,798
In the garage!

798
01:28:06,407 --> 01:28:09,843
- Wow. You dyed your hair.
- Yeah.

799
01:28:10,367 --> 01:28:11,880
Like it?

800
01:28:14,047 --> 01:28:16,003
Yeah, sure.

801
01:28:20,007 --> 01:28:21,838
You like Korean food?

802
01:28:22,687 --> 01:28:24,723
Sure. Yeah.

803
01:28:25,647 --> 01:28:27,205
Dig in.

804
01:28:30,647 --> 01:28:33,286
I thought we were gonna...

805
01:28:33,567 --> 01:28:35,239
Oh, I'm sorry.

806
01:28:38,847 --> 01:28:40,758
I thought we were gonna go out.

807
01:28:40,847 --> 01:28:43,236
Yeah. Maybe later.

808
01:28:47,247 --> 01:28:49,124
Recapping tonight's top story...

809
01:28:49,207 --> 01:28:52,005
...police are asking for your help
in locating this man.

810
01:28:52,087 --> 01:28:55,318
He's wanted in connection
with a series of brutal murders.

811
01:28:55,407 --> 01:28:57,921
Police believe he's in
the Washington area tonight.

812
01:28:58,007 --> 01:29:00,316
The man is armed
and extremely dangerous.

813
01:29:00,407 --> 01:29:04,685
If you see him, do not to approach him,
but notify authorities immediately.

814
01:30:09,967 --> 01:30:10,956
You know, when I first moved here...

815
01:30:11,887 --> 01:30:14,959
...I realized I was living
in someone else's house...

816
01:30:15,287 --> 01:30:17,642
...and that's a huge burden.
You're invited...

817
01:30:17,727 --> 01:30:20,161
...to live in the White House for four years...

818
01:30:20,247 --> 01:30:21,965
You feel like a renter in a sense?

819
01:30:22,047 --> 01:30:25,164
Most definitely.
With a lease that's renewable or...

820
01:30:25,287 --> 01:30:29,405
John F. Kennedy said once that if
somebody wanted to kill a public official...

821
01:30:29,487 --> 01:30:32,604
...they can get away with it
if they're willing to pay the price.

822
01:30:32,687 --> 01:30:36,236
It's impossible to provide
100 percent safety. Would you agree?

823
01:30:36,447 --> 01:30:38,039
Certainly.

824
01:30:38,127 --> 01:30:40,402
There is no way around that,
but hopefully...

825
01:30:40,487 --> 01:30:43,797
...there aren't that many people
who are willing to do that.

826
01:30:45,847 --> 01:30:46,563
What?

827
01:30:46,647 --> 01:30:50,196
Do you remember Valentina said,
"A statement, public and brutal."

828
01:30:50,487 --> 01:30:52,955
Now, it always bothered me.
Why did he keep coming?

829
01:30:53,047 --> 01:30:56,437
He knew we could protect the director,
especially once I got involved.

830
01:30:56,527 --> 01:30:58,518
But he didn't abort. Why?

831
01:30:58,607 --> 01:31:01,883
It didn't come together until
I remembered what he said to Valentina.

832
01:31:01,967 --> 01:31:04,435
"Tell Declan he can't protect his women."

833
01:31:04,607 --> 01:31:08,156
- Wasn't he referring to Isabella?
- No. Any woman. All women.

834
01:31:08,247 --> 01:31:11,364
But remember, "public and brutal."

835
01:31:12,047 --> 01:31:15,278
We're guarding the wrong person.
He's after the First Lady.

836
01:32:11,407 --> 01:32:14,285
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

837
01:32:14,607 --> 01:32:17,280
I'm sure you're as happy
as I am to be here today.

838
01:32:17,367 --> 01:32:19,722
It's been a lot of hard work for a lot of us...

839
01:32:19,807 --> 01:32:23,243
...but here we are,
and we're about to celebrate.

840
01:32:23,327 --> 01:32:26,842
And now it gives me great pleasure
to introduce the Surgeon General...

841
01:32:26,927 --> 01:32:28,883
...of the United States.

842
01:32:33,407 --> 01:32:36,126
Madam Chairperson,
ladies and gentlemen...

843
01:32:36,967 --> 01:32:40,039
...I'd like to chat with you today
about the family.

844
01:33:01,127 --> 01:33:02,640
She's already on the stage.

845
01:33:02,727 --> 01:33:04,922
Secret Service wants to know
what's going on.

846
01:33:05,007 --> 01:33:07,680
- Tell them.
- No, they'll try to get her off the stage.

847
01:33:07,767 --> 01:33:10,486
If they do that,
he'll shoot off into the crowd.

848
01:33:21,487 --> 01:33:24,047
We've worked long and hard
to reach our goal...

849
01:33:24,127 --> 01:33:27,517
...and I must say that we have
accomplished what we set out to do...

850
01:33:27,607 --> 01:33:29,404
...since we first began...

851
01:33:29,487 --> 01:33:31,284
...with a seed of an idea.

852
01:33:31,367 --> 01:33:34,006
It took many long and hard hours to...

853
01:33:44,687 --> 01:33:45,961
Get the word?

854
01:33:46,047 --> 01:33:50,006
Looking for a dark brown minivan
and anything else that's out of place.

855
01:33:50,087 --> 01:33:52,555
The only minivan we found
is this red one here.

856
01:33:52,647 --> 01:33:55,480
I checked it out.
They got a local parking permit...

857
01:33:55,567 --> 01:33:57,046
...DC tags.

858
01:33:57,127 --> 01:33:59,402
We can check it out again, if you want.

859
01:33:59,527 --> 01:34:02,997
It's probably one of those safer-than-sorry,
circle-jerk type deals.

860
01:34:03,087 --> 01:34:04,486
I'll see you.

861
01:34:04,567 --> 01:34:06,398
You guys be safe.

862
01:34:22,687 --> 01:34:25,565
Secret Service says
the search came out negative.

863
01:34:25,767 --> 01:34:28,440
They're on alert,
but she's going to the podium.

864
01:34:28,527 --> 01:34:30,438
Guess it's on us.

865
01:34:35,007 --> 01:34:36,838
You'll need a gun.

866
01:34:46,847 --> 01:34:50,522
Forget the laser. You'll have to walk me
through the optics on this thing.

867
01:34:50,607 --> 01:34:52,837
I haven't shot a gun in a while.

868
01:35:00,127 --> 01:35:03,324
I can see by the warm
and friendly faces out there...

869
01:35:03,407 --> 01:35:06,365
...that this christening
has been long anticipated.

870
01:35:07,247 --> 01:35:11,081
Thanks to all of you
who made this dream possible.

871
01:35:11,727 --> 01:35:14,764
We've worked long and hard
to reach our goal...

872
01:35:14,847 --> 01:35:18,522
...and I must say that we certainly have
accomplished what we set out to do.

873
01:35:25,527 --> 01:35:29,759
It's proof that when we set out
to reach new heights, it can be done.

874
01:36:05,287 --> 01:36:07,403
Go! Clear!

875
01:36:15,327 --> 01:36:17,283
Go! Clear!

876
01:36:24,607 --> 01:36:26,598
I'm going for the First Lady.

877
01:36:26,687 --> 01:36:29,645
You're cleared to shoot
on the weapon or the shooter.

878
01:36:33,847 --> 01:36:36,407
Ladies and gentlemen,
it gives me great pleasure...

879
01:36:36,487 --> 01:36:39,763
...to introduce the First Lady
of the United States.

880
01:36:47,287 --> 01:36:50,563
It's a beautiful day
for the beginning of New Hope.

881
01:36:53,527 --> 01:36:56,405
All right. Go!

882
01:37:42,927 --> 01:37:44,838
Give me the gun.

883
01:38:02,127 --> 01:38:03,958
So that's how he plans to get out.

884
01:38:04,047 --> 01:38:06,163
The phone, give me your phone.

885
01:38:23,007 --> 01:38:24,645
But also right now...

886
01:38:24,727 --> 01:38:27,799
...there are police officers
risking their very lives...

887
01:38:27,887 --> 01:38:30,879
...to help kids stay out of trouble
and off drugs.

888
01:38:45,047 --> 01:38:46,639
But also right now,
there are dedicated teachers...

889
01:38:47,607 --> 01:38:50,644
...preparing lessons for a new day's class.

890
01:38:53,207 --> 01:38:56,483
- Red minivan, hillside by the trees.
- One o'clock.

891
01:38:58,087 --> 01:39:00,078
- Jesus.
- Range it.

892
01:39:01,207 --> 01:39:03,960
750, 762 meters.

893
01:39:07,087 --> 01:39:09,521
...but values his family.

894
01:39:47,167 --> 01:39:50,045
Right. I'm after him.
You take out the minivan.

895
01:40:27,807 --> 01:40:30,560
Move it! Go!

896
01:41:19,167 --> 01:41:21,078
Coming through!

897
01:41:42,247 --> 01:41:43,805
Look out! Coming through!

898
01:41:49,967 --> 01:41:52,481
- Excuse me.
- Watch it, man!

899
01:42:49,087 --> 01:42:51,396
Please stand clear of the doors.

900
01:43:20,567 --> 01:43:22,000
No!

901
01:43:32,007 --> 01:43:33,486
Shit!

902
01:43:35,367 --> 01:43:38,325
The next train departing Capitol Heights...

903
01:46:39,127 --> 01:46:41,243
Help me, please!

904
01:46:47,847 --> 01:46:49,485
Help me!

905
01:46:51,887 --> 01:46:54,321
- Say, "Help me, Declan."
- Help me, Declan.

906
01:46:55,607 --> 01:46:57,723
Help me, Declan!

907
01:47:02,327 --> 01:47:04,124
Please help!

908
01:47:06,527 --> 01:47:08,677
Please, Declan, help me!

909
01:47:11,007 --> 01:47:13,805
Please help me!

910
01:47:19,967 --> 01:47:20,922
Louder!

911
01:47:21,007 --> 01:47:23,885
- Help me, Declan!
- Help me, Declan!

912
01:47:25,287 --> 01:47:28,085
Now tell him where I'm aiming the gun.

913
01:47:29,767 --> 01:47:32,406
Good girl.

914
01:47:35,007 --> 01:47:37,282
What are you gonna do, Declan?

915
01:47:37,367 --> 01:47:40,165
You just can't seem to protect
any of your women.

916
01:47:40,967 --> 01:47:43,356
Let her go.
She has nothing to do with this.

917
01:47:43,447 --> 01:47:45,403
Now, you can save this girl.

918
01:47:45,487 --> 01:47:47,682
- What's your name?
- Maggie.

919
01:47:47,767 --> 01:47:49,803
You can save Maggie, you see?

920
01:47:49,887 --> 01:47:51,718
You can save her right now.

921
01:47:52,327 --> 01:47:54,795
You just have to put down your little gun.

922
01:47:57,487 --> 01:47:59,398
Okay?

923
01:48:07,247 --> 01:48:08,999
No!

924
01:48:13,047 --> 01:48:15,515
Go ahead. Take a shot.

925
01:48:20,447 --> 01:48:24,156
Oh, Maggie, you did so good.

926
01:48:28,087 --> 01:48:30,123
You're slipping, Declan.

927
01:48:36,407 --> 01:48:38,398
Now let her go.

928
01:48:38,727 --> 01:48:40,718
Step away from the gun.

929
01:48:41,287 --> 01:48:43,721
Step away from the gun!

930
01:48:43,807 --> 01:48:46,002
Maggie, Maggie.

931
01:48:46,087 --> 01:48:47,725
You're so brave.

932
01:48:47,807 --> 01:48:50,446
You'll remember this
for the rest of your life.

933
01:48:57,007 --> 01:48:58,645
Kneel down.

934
01:49:02,807 --> 01:49:04,479
Kneel down.

935
01:49:27,807 --> 01:49:29,604
Sorry, Declan.

936
01:50:50,527 --> 01:50:52,916
It's all right. It's okay.

937
01:50:53,767 --> 01:50:55,280
It's okay.

938
01:51:00,847 --> 01:51:02,644
It's finished.

939
01:51:47,047 --> 01:51:49,481
I wonder if we'll ever know...

940
01:51:49,567 --> 01:51:52,081
...who the hell he really was.

941
01:51:53,327 --> 01:51:55,636
We know all we need to. He was evil...

942
01:51:56,767 --> 01:51:59,520
...he's dead and he's gone.
Nothing more matters.

943
01:52:02,127 --> 01:52:05,802
Sorry they didn't give you your pardon.
You'll get minimum security.

944
01:52:05,967 --> 01:52:07,685
It's like a country club.

945
01:52:07,767 --> 01:52:11,282
By the way,
Director Brown sends his warmest thanks.

946
01:52:11,447 --> 01:52:14,598
Oh, that's nice.
Look forward to playing tennis with him.

947
01:52:15,847 --> 01:52:17,997
Did I tell you I'm going back to Russia?

948
01:52:18,087 --> 01:52:22,478
And I'm going to stay until Terek Murad
rots in prison or in the grave.

949
01:52:24,127 --> 01:52:25,765
She'd appreciate that.

950
01:52:26,607 --> 01:52:28,245
I think so.

951
01:52:28,527 --> 01:52:30,245
And Isabella?

952
01:52:31,647 --> 01:52:34,081
Back safe with her family.

953
01:52:34,287 --> 01:52:36,118
For good.

954
01:52:36,327 --> 01:52:38,841
I know about that key she gave you.

955
01:52:39,607 --> 01:52:43,043
I know you could have used it
to take off any time you wanted to.

956
01:52:43,167 --> 01:52:46,842
You've got one of those
drop boxes, too, like the Jackal?

957
01:52:49,287 --> 01:52:52,438
Did you read the paper today?
I'm quite the hero because of you.

958
01:52:52,527 --> 01:52:55,166
The agent who saved the First Lady.

959
01:52:55,687 --> 01:52:59,566
I could screw everything else up
for the rest of my life and still be...

960
01:53:00,047 --> 01:53:01,480
...untouchable.

961
01:53:02,407 --> 01:53:03,601
That a fact, then?

962
01:53:04,727 --> 01:53:07,116
Going back to the drop box:

963
01:53:07,447 --> 01:53:09,802
An operative with your experience...

964
01:53:09,887 --> 01:53:11,843
...with a clean passport...

965
01:53:11,927 --> 01:53:13,758
...a wad of cash.

966
01:53:14,687 --> 01:53:17,804
I'll bet if you had taken off...

967
01:53:20,687 --> 01:53:22,723
...we never would have found you.

968
01:53:26,207 --> 01:53:27,686
Do you drink coffee?

969
01:53:27,767 --> 01:53:30,725
Oh, no, that's right.
They drink Guinness in Ireland.

970
01:53:31,687 --> 01:53:34,997
I'll ask across the street.
See if they've got any.

971
01:53:35,327 --> 01:53:36,885
Coffee, I mean.

972
01:53:36,967 --> 01:53:38,685
I'll be back in...

973
01:53:39,607 --> 01:53:42,326
...thirty minutes, okay?

974
01:53:48,207 --> 01:53:50,437
Thanks, Declan, for everything.

975
01:53:51,567 --> 01:53:53,398
No, thank you.
