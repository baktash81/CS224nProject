1
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,250
<i>Some people are lovers.</i>

2
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,833
<i>Others, fighters.</i>

3
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:45,375
<i>And sometimes it's hard
to tell the difference.</i>

4
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,416
<i>I was born a fighter,
but a girl's got bills to pay,</i>

5
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,208
<i>and I didn't have a safety net.</i>

6
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:54,000
<i>When I wasn't at school, I got a job</i>

7
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:56,208
<i>training clients for Julian James,</i>

8
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:58,416
<i>the best fighter on this side
of the Mississippi</i>

9
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,166
<i>and the only father figure I'd ever had.</i>

10
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,125
Looks like she's doing all the work.

11
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:08,083
- Keep it up, Sienna.
- Nice. One more. Nice.

12
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,000
<i>Now, my sister Beth,</i>

13
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:16,000
<i>she's a lover, and my other half.</i>

14
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,500
<i>I mean, don't get me wrong.
She drives me nuts,</i>

15
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,500
<i>but our friend Brent balances us out.</i>

16
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,416
<i>That was the extent of my social circle,</i>

17
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,875
<i>and to be honest, I liked it that way.</i>

18
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:28,958
- You need to focus.
- I tried. That's all you.

19
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:32,083
I mean, I have more interests.
I don't have to go to college.

20
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:34,458
Oh, yeah. You know, why?
Why would you get a big girl job

21
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:36,916
when you could just be
mooching off me forever?

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,416
- Great idea. I like where your head's at.
- Ha ha.

23
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,750
- So…
- I'm gonna be right back.

24
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:44,033
- Just give me one sec.
- I don't think it's gonna work.

25
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:49,875
- Hey. I'm Jax.
- Hi.

26
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:52,916
<i>Oh, I knew exactly who he was.</i>

27
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:57,083
Sienna, right?
I heard you're a great trainer.

28
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:59,083
Maybe we can get in the ring sometime.

29
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:03,375
<i>Yeah, he was cute,
but he had a reputation,</i>

30
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,375
<i>and I wasn't just gonna let my guard down.</i>

31
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:13,041
<i>He was a fighter…</i>

32
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,833
<i>…and a lover,</i>

33
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,666
<i>an intoxicating combination.</i>

34
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,416
One. One, two.

35
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,416
Two. One, two. Two.

36
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,916
<i>Jax was the best I'd ever trained</i>

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,916
<i>and the best fighter UFG had ever had.</i>

38
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:37,416
Nice. It's not just about power, okay?

39
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,208
- It's about precision.
- Is that right?

40
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,833
Making her MXM debut,

41
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,416
we have standing in the center ring

42
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,166
a mixed martial artist from Springfield.

43
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,666
- 12 wins by knock-out.
- Whoo!

44
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:54,625
Sienna "The Princess of Rage" Lane!

45
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:58,208
- Whoo!
- And the crowd goes wild!

46
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,916
Whoo!

47
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,500
- But…
- Ugh, "but…"

48
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,541
I'm not a princess.

49
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:11,208
No? You're my princess.

50
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:15,333
<i>I tried to keep things professional, but…</i>

51
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,708
Whoo!

52
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,208
<i>…I was hooked.</i>

53
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,041
<i>One hit was never enough.</i>

54
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,250
Psst. Sienna.

55
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,416
Sienna.

56
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,416
You're zoning out.

57
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,541
I love you.

58
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,059
<i>Normally, I'd have been more outspoken</i>

59
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,625
<i>about his habit of tempting fate,</i>

60
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,625
<i>but he thought he was invincible,</i>

61
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,708
<i>and I bought in to the myth.</i>

62
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,833
- <i>Until he had an accident…</i>
- Are you doing okay?

63
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,166
<i>…that brought us both back to reality.</i>

64
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,500
- Si, what if I never...
- Hey.

65
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,458
What if I can't fight anymore?

66
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,291
We're gonna get through this.

67
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,541
You don't have to be here.

68
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,000
- Are you crazy?
- Maybe.

69
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:25,000
- We're a team.
- Yeah.

70
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,916
Rebel champions.

71
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:33,000
<i>Seeing him like that, so human,</i>

72
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,375
<i>hurting, made it all feel real.</i>

73
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:41,083
Try to get it parallel to your hip, okay?

74
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,166
Yep.

75
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:47,833
I'm done.

76
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,208
- Where are you going?
- What's the point?

77
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,833
If I can't kick, I can't fight.

78
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:56,208
Yes, you can, Jax,
if we strengthen your other skills.

79
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,291
What other skills?

80
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,500
Come here.

81
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:14,083
We're gonna find you a new edge. Okay?

82
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,000
Yeah.

83
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,708
<i>He needed me…</i>

84
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,500
<i>…and that's when I really fell.</i>

85
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,416
<i>We were so much more connected,</i>

86
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,666
<i>and eventually he came back</i>

87
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,833
<i>better than before</i>

88
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:52,250
<i>in every way.</i>

89
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,916
Hey, looking good.

90
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,833
<i>This is Jax. Leave a message.</i>

91
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,625
Hey, uh, so my last client canceled.

92
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:07,833
Um, I'm just going to run
to the nutrition shop for you

93
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,708
and I will be right home.

94
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,166
- Thank you.
- Okay.

95
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,125
- Thanks.
- Okay.

96
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,541
<i>Things were really good.</i>

97
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,625
<i>And that feeling?</i>

98
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:29,291
<i>Man, I was riding the high…</i>

99
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,875
<i>…but I should've known
there would be a comedown.</i>

100
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,833
Jax, Beth…

101
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,916
- Sienna.
- I'm so sorry.

102
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:37,708
Oh, shit.

103
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,833
<i>No matter how far I'd fallen,</i>

104
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:50,208
<i>I couldn't get him off my mind.</i>

105
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,375
<i>And the worst part?</i>

106
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,083
<i>He probably wasn't even
giving me a second thought.</i>

107
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,166
- Hey, champ. You okay?
- I'm good.

108
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,708
- Great job this week.
- Thank you.

109
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,875
See you tomorrow, boss.

110
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:17,083
<i>Next stop,
Springfield Community College.</i>

111
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,833
<i>Welcome to rock bottom.</i>

112
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:30,208
<i>I needed a new project,
somewhere to focus my energy.</i>

113
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:33,000
<i>But I'd settle for a distraction,</i>

114
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,083
<i>so school would have to do.</i>

115
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,708
<i>Econ 101 was not my fave,</i>

116
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,583
<i>but at least I had Brent.</i>

117
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,000
<i>Brent's a good guy.</i>

118
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,833
<i>He's smart, levelheaded,</i>

119
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,541
<i>and not fucking my sister.</i>

120
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,625
<i>In fact, he's all loved up</i>

121
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,541
<i>and getting married in eight weeks.</i>

122
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,833
Wow, that's what I get
for saving you the best seat in the house?

123
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,083
I see how it is.

124
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,833
You okay?

125
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,833
I caught my sister
and my boyfriend of a year

126
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,875
having sex in our apartment,

127
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,583
and I spent the night in the gym.

128
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,666
Beth and Jax? Shit.

129
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,708
Do you have a place to stay?

130
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:25,083
I can't afford much.
There's a wait list for campus housing.

131
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:33,083
I may know a guy renting a room for,
like, 250 a month.

132
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,916
- Yeah?
- Just, um, be careful.

133
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,416
- He's...
- What? An ax murderer?

134
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,791
Complicated.

135
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,500
You spent the night with Daniel?

136
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,541
Jesus, Alex, I was worried sick.

137
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,250
<i>He lives in a basement?</i>

138
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,916
<i>Now I'm really getting murder-y vibes.</i>

139
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,208
- Fuck me.
- Excuse me?

140
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:35,208
<i>Oh, shit.
That was supposed to be my inside voice.</i>

141
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:38,458
Um, hi.

142
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,208
Kayden, right?

143
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,625
Brent told me that you might be
looking for a roommate.

144
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,083
- No.
- What? No?

145
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:52,541
Look, I'm in a really tight spot.

146
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,791
- No offense...
- Oh, wow.

147
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,625
- What?
- No, it's just people say that,

148
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,208
"No offense," like it'll
absolve them of the guilt

149
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,041
of whatever asshole thing
they were about to say.

150
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,708
So what was it you were gonna say?

151
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,625
I don't think it's gonna be a good fit.

152
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:10,333
Look, I've been through a lot.
I have nowhere else to stay.

153
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:11,708
Not my problem.

154
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,166
<i>Okay. Fair point.</i>

155
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,666
<i>It wasn't his problem.</i>

156
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:21,000
<i>But did he have to be such a jerk?</i>

157
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,416
<i>Well, at least he's up-front about it.</i>

158
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,291
<i>Jax kept that shit under wraps
till I was far too gone.</i>

159
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:30,000
<i>Back to the drawing board.</i>

160
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,500
<i>As much as I hated asking for help,</i>

161
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:35,291
<i>maybe Julian could give me
a little direction.</i>

162
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:39,958
Julian, got anyone
on the books for me today?

163
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,625
'Fraid not.

164
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,625
Everybody's jumping ship.

165
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:49,000
Basement brawls
are starting back up at Powder Keg.

166
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,958
More money, less rules,

167
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:56,166
and Jax is the poster boy.

168
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,500
You didn't know?

169
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,791
Loyalty isn't really his thing.

170
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,267
Yeah, well, ever since he stormed out,

171
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,166
we've been dying a slow death,

172
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,083
and now we've lost our best fighter.

173
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,416
- How are we supposed to compete with that?
- Well, we don't.

174
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,000
I would rather lose this gym honestly
than stoop to the underground.

175
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,958
I mean, it's a sport. It's not worth
getting somebody killed for.

176
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:23,000
<i>Kayden "The Killer" Williams, huh?</i>

177
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,083
<i>Small world.</i>

178
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,416
<i>Powder Keg was UFG's biggest rival,</i>

179
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,291
<i>and the underground operated
out of their basement.</i>

180
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:36,208
<i>Nothing feels legal here...
Because it isn't.</i>

181
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,916
You're a trainer? UFG, huh?

182
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,416
There is only one rule!

183
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,625
There are no rules!

184
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,000
Oh, man, he's out!

185
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,541
Hey there, princess.
Come to watch me fight?

186
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,625
- No, I've seen enough.
- Hey, hey.

187
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,083
- All right, stop.
- It just...

188
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,125
It just happened, okay?
You're the only one who understands me.

189
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:18,208
I don't understand you at all.

190
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,750
Please, can you help me do that?

191
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,875
I don't know, you just... you got so busy.

192
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,625
- Busy? Taking care of you!
- No, I didn't mean it like that, okay?

193
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,517
- You know I'm not good at this stuff.
- For the last year,

194
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,958
it's been all about you.

195
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,583
Figuring out how to rehab your stupid leg,

196
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:35,416
meal prepping for you, loving you,

197
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,666
making sure that you're good
to fight again.

198
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,333
I made a mistake. Babe...

199
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:43,041
A mistake is forgetting to pick up dinner.

200
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:47,916
Fucking my little sister is an act of war.

201
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:50,666
Si...

202
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,000
5 to 1 odds.

203
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,000
Deadbeat's favored. You want in?

204
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,916
100 on Kayden Williams.

205
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,250
Right.

206
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:31,125
Yeah! Let's go!

207
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,333
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

208
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,500
Brent? What are you doing here?

209
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,500
I could ask you the same thing.

210
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,625
I, uh... I'm here with my fiancé.

211
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,500
Evans. You must be Sienna.

212
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,833
- Heard you had a rough week, huh?
- Yeah.

213
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,791
But it's good to finally meet you.

214
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,625
<i>Unlike my love life,</i>

215
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,208
<i>which had been very much on display,</i>

216
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,000
<i>Brent kept things low-key.</i>

217
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:58,166
<i>Like, he'd never introduced me
to his fiancé low-key.</i>

218
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:07,416
Kayden "The Killer" Williams!

219
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,416
Ready? Ready?

220
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,916
Go. Fight.

221
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,125
How do you know each other again?

222
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,875
He's my brother.

223
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,791
I didn't know you had a brother.

224
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:49,875
Adopted.

225
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,291
Come here.

226
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:15,166
He's good, but he's not unbeatable.

227
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,291
He was till tonight.

228
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,708
Fuck.

229
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,541
How do you know him?

230
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:56,291
That's my ex.

231
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,666
<i>I'd give anything for Jax</i>

232
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,000
<i>to get a taste of his own medicine.</i>

233
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,375
<i>It didn't look like
that was gonna happen tonight,</i>

234
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:06,166
<i>but Kayden had promise.</i>

235
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:22,916
Police, police, police!

236
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,750
- Shit. Shit, shit, shit.
- Hey, it's a raid.

237
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,791
Deadbeat, break it up! We need to get out!

238
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,208
- Everybody's going!
- See you later, Sienna.

239
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,666
- We're not done yet.
- Let's go, let's go.

240
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,916
- Everybody out of here.
- I want my rematch, Killer!

241
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,208
Keep walking.

242
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:53,333
- Come on, everybody out.
- All right, let's go.

243
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:10,083
<i>Okay, I guess this is rock bottom.</i>

244
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,000
<i>Hopefully.</i>

245
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,541
<i>I was out my last hundred bucks,</i>

246
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,791
<i>and I couldn't keep sneaking into the gym.</i>

247
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,458
I haven't tied one on
like that in so long.

248
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,708
Hey, good for you. Good for you.

249
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,625
<i>I had to stop feeling sorry for myself.</i>

250
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:38,083
<i>No more sad girl shit,</i>

251
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,666
<i>I was on to that mad girl shit.</i>

252
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,875
<i>And I was not about to let
Jax get away with this.</i>

253
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,000
<i>Powder Keg was the seventh circle of hell,</i>

254
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,208
<i>right after CrossFit,</i>

255
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,916
<i>but you can't slay a demon
if you're afraid of fire.</i>

256
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,434
I thought I told you
I didn't want to see you again.

257
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:01,041
Technically, you told me
I wasn't your problem.

258
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:04,708
And you were right. I am your solution.

259
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:08,250
- I'm good.
- You're good, but you're not great.

260
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,916
Your reflexes are quick,
but you've got poor intention.

261
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,583
Your defense is spotty,
you telegraph your punches,

262
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,476
and you're not using
the right hip movement on the mat

263
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,791
to offset someone stronger, which he is.

264
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:23,208
- And that's why you need me.
- Oh, I need you?

265
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:27,000
Yeah, I am the only person
who can help you beat Jax Deneris.

266
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,791
Who said I'm taking a rematch?

267
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,500
I mean…

268
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,041
Look, I've been in the ring
with Jax for three years.

269
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:41,208
I stand before you a copy of your enemy.

270
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:45,708
I know how he thinks,
how he trains, how he kills.

271
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,416
I saw you lose, and I am the only one

272
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,583
who can make sure
that doesn't happen again.

273
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,166
Okay, what are you offering specifically?

274
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,416
I train you six days a week
from now through the rematch.

275
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,666
I train every day, 3-6-5.

276
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,550
Yeah, that's the first thing
I'll be changing.

277
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,875
You want me to train less?

278
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,916
No, I want you to train smarter,

279
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,958
and rest days are a part of that.

280
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:19,833
And in turn, you…

281
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,250
let me stay in your apartment.

282
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,833
I mean, come on.

283
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,416
I bet all my money on you last night,

284
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,708
so, I mean, you kind of owe me.

285
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:38,250
All right, lucky, let's see what you got.

286
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,958
Well, I mean, for starters,

287
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,392
just keep your eyes a little bit forward

288
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,791
and take that curve out of your neck.

289
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:50,291
Just kind of tuck in your lumbar sacrum.

290
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:58,958
Your room's over there.

291
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,500
<i>Yikes.</i>

292
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,875
Hey, you go to SCC too.

293
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:22,333
I didn't get to introduce
myself the other day. Cara.

294
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,208
Sienna.

295
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,958
- Want a ride?
- Uh, no, I'm good.

296
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,416
Are you sure? 'Cause the bus sucks,

297
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,250
and we're going to the same place.
Let's go.

298
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:42,000
- She's temperamental.
- Mm.

299
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,708
I'm guessing
I can't link my Spotify in this?

300
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,875
No.

301
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:58,000
So, you lived in Springfield
your whole life

302
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,208
and you don't have
any family here or friends?

303
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,083
- Not anymore.
- Why's that?

304
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,833
Because that's my sister

305
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:11,041
and that's my ex-boyfriend.

306
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,708
Oh.

307
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,416
Si, look, I tried to tell you,

308
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,625
but you're not the easiest
person to talk to.

309
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:22,416
I've been working my ass off
trying to take care of you.

310
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:26,226
Beth, I haven't been able
to get you to come to school for months,

311
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,041
and then you're gonna come together?

312
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:32,541
Si, I'm sorry...

313
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:34,875
You don't know what
you're dealing with, okay?

314
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:37,291
He is toxic and manipulative.

315
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,958
You can't fix him.

316
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,916
I already tried.

317
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:58,208
Kayden. Come on, cupcake. Rise and shine.

318
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:15,625
Motherfucker.

319
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:18,458
Hey, asshole, we had a deal.

320
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:23,291
Hey, you're done.

321
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:28,416
Listen, I gave you
your money back. We're even.

322
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,000
I don't want your handouts, okay?
I want to win.

323
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:32,916
We had a deal. Hit me.

324
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,666
- No.
- Come on.

325
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,333
Hit me. Let's go!

326
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,000
Look, I don't want to hurt you.

327
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,541
Find another project.
This is not personal.

328
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,166
Come on.

329
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,708
Hit me. Let's go.

330
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,708
All right. Let's go.

331
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:06,875
Come on.

332
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:19,625
It is personal to me.

333
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:24,625
You wanna beat him? You just lost.

334
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:27,208
<i>You're mine, Sienna.</i>

335
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:29,500
<i>I want you. All of you.</i>

336
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,708
Sienna, I'm tapping.

337
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:39,791
Sienna.

338
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,166
<i>Seriously?</i>

339
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,916
<i>Why does my mind keep going back to Jax?</i>

340
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,750
You hungry?

341
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:55,083
Yeah.

342
00:24:57,208 --> 00:25:00,958
Hi, neighbors. The usual?

343
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,833
- Mm-hmm.
- You got it.

344
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:05,625
Can I get you anything?

345
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:08,833
Five egg whites, scrambled,
with a side of salsa,

346
00:25:08,916 --> 00:25:11,750
half an avocado,
and a chicken breast, no oil.

347
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:14,125
Coming right up.

348
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:21,416
So, uh, what are you studying?

349
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,708
Social economics in business.

350
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,791
Impressive.

351
00:25:28,916 --> 00:25:31,875
Look, this is gonna be really hard.

352
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:34,583
Hard?

353
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,000
The hardest you'll train in your life.

354
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:38,125
Don't flatter yourself.

355
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:40,125
I am never dating another fighter.

356
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:43,708
You shouldn't. Especially me.

357
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:53,625
- Excuse me.
- That's what you're eating?

358
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:56,500
Nope, that's what you're eating.

359
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:03,333
Mmm.

360
00:26:03,416 --> 00:26:06,416
You know there's no weight class
in the underground, right?

361
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,625
Jax is bigger than me.

362
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:10,976
You don't need to cut,
but you should be tracking your macros.

363
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,750
Pack proteins with isolates,
and you'd better not be juicing.

364
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:16,708
What else?

365
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:18,851
Julian doesn't want
any of his team in the underground,

366
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:21,666
so I come to you at Powder Keg.

367
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,833
You do exactly what I say.

368
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,750
No drinking, no smoking, no partying.

369
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:27,875
No problem.

370
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,916
That's a really good burger.

371
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:44,500
I know. It's my usual.

372
00:26:45,916 --> 00:26:47,375
Good choice.

373
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:07,291
Come on. Quick feet!

374
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,291
Keep your abs tight.

375
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,125
Good to see you, stranger.

376
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:26,708
Nice to see you too, boss.

377
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,000
I got a few interesting calls this week.

378
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,000
One from a promoter

379
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:34,416
seeing if you wanted
to fight at the nationals.

380
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:36,208
- Me?
- Yeah.

381
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:38,500
- Fight?
- Yeah.

382
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:41,000
I'm just really busy. Um…

383
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:43,833
Yeah, right, with all your clients.

384
00:28:43,916 --> 00:28:47,416
No, I just am taking
20 credits this semester.

385
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,208
- Your sister called.
- Here?

386
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:52,625
Yeah, she says you're not
answering your phone.

387
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:54,666
Yeah, my bad?

388
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,625
She sounded like
she was seriously concerned.

389
00:28:56,708 --> 00:28:59,125
Wow. That's ironic.

390
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:03,833
You know what?
Holding onto anger is like drinking poison

391
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:05,958
and expecting the other person to die.

392
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:11,041
It's keeping you from being your best.

393
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:16,291
Or maybe it's just giving me my edge.

394
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:18,125
Get real with yourself, Sienna.

395
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:22,833
I just think whatever it is,
this story that you're telling yourself,

396
00:29:22,916 --> 00:29:24,458
it's not necessarily reality.

397
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:36,750
Okay, what are you looking at?

398
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:45,666
Don't just defend. Be first.

399
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,833
For every one, you give three.

400
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:53,250
No.

401
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,125
You're letting your guard down.

402
00:29:57,083 --> 00:29:59,041
- That's it.
- No, that's not it.

403
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:02,500
Defense is not an action.
It's a given, okay?

404
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:04,500
Your resting state should be impenetrable.

405
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:07,083
No one gets in, no one can hurt you.

406
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:08,791
Come on, one, two.

407
00:30:12,916 --> 00:30:15,125
Every time someone attacks,
they leave an opening.

408
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:17,791
Find the opening, close for the kill.

409
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:20,166
Right hook.

410
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:24,375
Find the opening…

411
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:28,708
…close for the kill.

412
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,083
Okay.

413
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:45,416
Sienna, can I talk to you, please?

414
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,791
Since when do you even work out?

415
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:48,750
I didn't know you were gonna be here.

416
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:50,375
Talk to me, please.

417
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:52,833
- Get out of my way, Beth.
- No!

418
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:55,666
- Jax told me to stand up for myself.
- Oh, he did?

419
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,750
Did he also tell you
to do your hair like this?

420
00:30:57,833 --> 00:31:00,416
'Cause it looks like
you fucked the Easter Bunny.

421
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,458
Move.

422
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:13,666
<i>I was trying to move on,
but talk about triggering.</i>

423
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:17,583
<i>Jax had told me
to stand up for myself, too,</i>

424
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:20,416
<i>unless it got in the way
of what he wanted.</i>

425
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,684
- That's all you got?
- Come on.

426
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:23,416
- That's it?
- Hit me back.

427
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,333
I'm not gonna hit you back, okay?
I need you in one piece.

428
00:31:26,416 --> 00:31:29,291
If I'm ever gonna fight,
I need to take a hit.

429
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:31,333
Who said you're gonna fight?

430
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:37,041
<i>The things you overlook
when you're under their influence.</i>

431
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:39,791
Ooh!

432
00:31:41,916 --> 00:31:44,916
Come on, I could be really good.

433
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,666
You are good, but you're a better trainer.

434
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,208
Was that your sister?

435
00:32:12,291 --> 00:32:13,583
How could you tell?

436
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:16,500
The tension.

437
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:18,166
Mm.

438
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:23,625
- What?
- Nothing.

439
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,059
Nothing? Doesn't sound like nothing.

440
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:27,500
- What does it sound like?
- Judgment.

441
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:30,416
- I don't know the situation here…
- No, you don't.

442
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,416
- …but family is important.
- Yeah?

443
00:32:33,458 --> 00:32:36,500
Is that why you're holed up
in a basement alone?

444
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:39,291
Stay in your lane.

445
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:54,000
<i>Of course I was angry.</i>

446
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:56,000
<i>It was helping me get over Jax.</i>

447
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:58,916
<i>And I was getting over him.</i>

448
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,708
<i>Kinda.</i>

449
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:51,000
<i>Sienna.</i>

450
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:53,583
<i>Sienna.</i>

451
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:55,333
Sienna!

452
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:57,041
Good dream?

453
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:59,416
Shit.

454
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,625
My alarm didn't go off.

455
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:04,750
Let's go. It is officially confirmed.

456
00:34:04,833 --> 00:34:07,041
10:00, March 31st.

457
00:34:08,416 --> 00:34:10,291
- The rematch?
- Mm-hmm.

458
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:14,125
Okay, you're gonna do what I say, right?

459
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:17,291
No moody disappearing act or quid pro quo?

460
00:34:18,416 --> 00:34:20,375
"If you do this, I'll do that."

461
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,000
I know what quid pro quo means.

462
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:25,541
- So?
- Yes, sensei.

463
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:26,958
Good.

464
00:34:27,041 --> 00:34:29,416
By the way, you talk in your sleep.

465
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:37,916
<i>We'd made progress,
but if he was gonna have</i>

466
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,916
<i>any chance of beating Jax</i>

467
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,958
<i>I'd need to pull out all the stops.</i>

468
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:46,541
- Come on.
- What is this?

469
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,916
Mixing your MA. Do you trust me?

470
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,208
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you sure?

471
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:53,625
Well, when you say it like that…

472
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:07,416
Okay.

473
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,916
This is sensitivity training.

474
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,208
The basic theory is
if your breath is grounded in your body

475
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:14,833
and you're in sync with your opponent,

476
00:35:14,916 --> 00:35:17,625
you can overtake them
no matter their size.

477
00:35:17,708 --> 00:35:20,916
Okay? So just feel me.

478
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,291
Uh-huh. Nice and easy.

479
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:27,416
Breathe.

480
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,083
Feel my next move.

481
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:34,416
So, stay grounded in your body

482
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:37,708
so no matter what tries to control you…

483
00:35:39,416 --> 00:35:40,916
- Whoa!
- Oh!

484
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:46,291
- Don't fall off.
- I'm not gonna let you fall.

485
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,083
You're good.

486
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:54,208
Feel my next movement. Yep, yep.

487
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:58,000
That's it. That's it.

488
00:35:58,083 --> 00:36:00,333
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

489
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:06,916
Nice.

490
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,500
- Again.
- Again.

491
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:18,083
You are a unique trainer, Sensei Lane.

492
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:22,083
I borrowed that exercise from Julian.

493
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:26,833
- He is a legend.
- Yeah.

494
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:30,291
It's big shoes to fill.

495
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:37,833
We talked about me maybe...

496
00:36:37,916 --> 00:36:39,791
Maybe running the gym with him someday.

497
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:41,208
Really?

498
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:42,833
It's kind of why I'm studying business

499
00:36:42,916 --> 00:36:45,416
so I can help
with the books and everything.

500
00:36:46,416 --> 00:36:48,666
So you really never considered fighting?

501
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:55,250
Of course I did. I do.

502
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:01,208
But Jax always said I wasn't tough enough,

503
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:03,583
- strong enough, good enough.
- Mm.

504
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:08,125
Looking back, I think he didn't want me
to take what was his.

505
00:37:08,916 --> 00:37:10,916
The irony.

506
00:37:12,291 --> 00:37:14,625
And there's a whole stigma with women

507
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:18,625
like we shouldn't get punched in the face
because beauty's our only asset,

508
00:37:18,708 --> 00:37:21,416
whereas men can afford to get busted up

509
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,500
because you guys have
other valued qualities.

510
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,833
Well, not that my opinion
matters for shit,

511
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:36,916
but I support you fighting whatever war
you see as important.

512
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,083
Inside and outside the cage.

513
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:46,041
I saw Jax and Beth at the gym.

514
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:51,541
I've done a lot of things
in my life that I regret…

515
00:37:53,708 --> 00:37:55,291
…but he should know better.

516
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,166
He's going to.

517
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:12,166
Come on, you're letting your guard down.

518
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,000
Come on, Kayden, stay ahead of him.

519
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,000
- Nice, Kayden.
- He's getting better.

520
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:19,041
Yeah, his timing is improving.

521
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:20,208
Come on.

522
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:23,041
That's it. Find the openings!

523
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:26,458
Hit the holes! Nice.

524
00:38:26,541 --> 00:38:29,625
- Come on.
- Hey, princess.

525
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:31,958
You see me fight the other night?

526
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:33,375
KO in 34 seconds.

527
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:35,291
Jax, stop. I'm working.

528
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:37,708
- This is your new guy?
- Come on, Kayden.

529
00:38:37,791 --> 00:38:41,000
Yikes. That's a step down.

530
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:43,208
He's just sparring.

531
00:38:43,291 --> 00:38:45,541
Come on, let me talk to you for a second.

532
00:38:45,625 --> 00:38:46,625
Hey.

533
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:48,309
You're too good for this
underground bullshit.

534
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:49,458
You don't belong here.

535
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:51,375
Since when do you care
about my well-being?

536
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:53,666
What? You can't say that
I don't care about you.

537
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,059
When I wanted to fight on my own,

538
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,916
you didn't believe in me,
you shut it down.

539
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,416
And then when I tried to
get close to you, you cheated.

540
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,458
I got scared, okay? It's fight or flight.

541
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,875
But I miss you, Si. Remember?

542
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:08,958
It's you and I against the world.

543
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:10,750
Come here. Stop.

544
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:12,458
Kayden, protect yourself!

545
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:14,666
Keep moving.

546
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,833
- You're still seeing her.
- I can stop.

547
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:20,458
She's just easier.

548
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,291
- Easier?
- I didn't mean it like that.

549
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:25,833
Kayden Williams is the next champion,

550
00:39:25,916 --> 00:39:28,125
and I'm training him to break you.

551
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:35,625
- Here, hold still.
- Mm.

552
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:37,708
- Is that okay?
- Mm-hmm.

553
00:39:37,791 --> 00:39:40,833
- What'd Jax say?
- It doesn't matter.

554
00:39:40,916 --> 00:39:42,500
All that matters is that we win.

555
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:46,125
- What if we don't win?
- We will.

556
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:47,416
He knows you're a threat,

557
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,416
especially now that you have me.

558
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,416
Jax preys on weakness, okay?

559
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,625
So if you any,
we need to know what they are

560
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:55,625
- and get ahead of them.
- Uh-huh.

561
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:58,000
- Look what we got.
- Look what we have here.

562
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:01,416
My girlfriend said you were begging
for sloppy seconds.

563
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,416
- Thought she was joking.
- You know, you have a really interesting

564
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,291
definition of girlfriend,
if it's someone you use,

565
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:09,458
gaslight, and cheat on
with her own sister.

566
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:12,208
Honestly,
not that surprising coming from someone

567
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:14,892
that dropped out of the big leagues
to fight below their weight class.

568
00:40:14,916 --> 00:40:17,291
- You don't know shit about me.
- Yeah?

569
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:20,000
- Yeah, there you go.
- Oh!

570
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:22,541
- Back off, deadbeat!
- Oh, princess!

571
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:28,541
- Don't fucking call me that.
- Oh.

572
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:30,416
Forgot how sexy you are when you're angry.

573
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:35,208
Almost as sexy as your sister.

574
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:37,000
Yikes.

575
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:39,041
Too much?

576
00:40:41,541 --> 00:40:43,041
Shit! Sienna!

577
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:46,875
What the fuck? Hey!

578
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:50,541
What the fuck? Get over here!

579
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,083
I'll fucking kill you!

580
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:56,833
Go to hell!

581
00:41:04,666 --> 00:41:06,791
<i>Jax brought out the worst in me,</i>

582
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:09,291
<i>but it felt good standing up to him.</i>

583
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,500
<i>Maybe I need to do more for myself.</i>

584
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:30,483
What are you doing? I told you, I...

585
00:41:30,541 --> 00:41:33,291
You convinced yourself
you don't deserve a home. I know.

586
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:36,000
So, what do you think?

587
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:39,375
Belladonna Lily or Labrador Blue?

588
00:41:43,916 --> 00:41:47,291
What? Was Benjamin Moore out of
Doom and Gloom Gray?

589
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:50,291
Yeah, as well as Brooding Beige.

590
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:55,958
Hmm. What about Annoying Orange
or Relentless Red?

591
00:41:56,041 --> 00:41:58,250
No, they weren't.

592
00:41:58,333 --> 00:42:00,666
Apparently, they still have those ones.

593
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,583
- Unfortunate.
- Mm-hmm.

594
00:42:07,666 --> 00:42:10,541
Come here!

595
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:22,791
- Oh, no. You wouldn't.
- I wouldn't?

596
00:42:22,875 --> 00:42:24,208
- No.
- You don't think I will?

597
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:25,811
- No, I don't.
- I will if you dare me.

598
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,958
- Not even that one. No, no.
- You owe me.

599
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:36,125
You brought this upon yourself.

600
00:42:36,208 --> 00:42:37,684
Come on. Just a little bit. Just a little.

601
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:39,625
- Okay. Okay, a little.
- You owe it to me.

602
00:42:39,708 --> 00:42:41,916
- Just a little. Just a little.
- Yeah, okay.

603
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:04,583
What?

604
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,500
I can't.

605
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:11,875
I can't have any distractions right now.

606
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,208
I gotta get my head in the game.

607
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:17,875
I was almost pinned last night.

608
00:43:17,958 --> 00:43:20,625
You're right.

609
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:22,500
Okay, we just need to focus.

610
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,916
Maybe we should try something different.

611
00:43:28,416 --> 00:43:30,916
<i>No, absolutely not.</i>

612
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,416
You don't understand
how dangerous it is, okay?

613
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,333
It's not a sport, it's senseless violence,

614
00:43:36,416 --> 00:43:38,750
and UFG is above that.

615
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:40,916
If I get caught, I lose my license.

616
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,250
I lose everything.

617
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:44,208
You're losing now anyway.

618
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:45,833
We've been underwater for months.

619
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:47,916
Kayden is the real deal.

620
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,125
So why does he fight in the underground?

621
00:43:50,208 --> 00:43:52,916
Why don't you ask him?

622
00:44:00,541 --> 00:44:02,750
Julian, this is Kayden.

623
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:05,500
It's an honor.
I used to watch all your interviews.

624
00:44:06,375 --> 00:44:07,458
Without you, I...

625
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:09,476
What, you wouldn't be
beating up men in basements?

626
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:14,166
Yeah, but you... you opened my eyes.
You opened my mind.

627
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,250
- Oh, I did?
- Yeah.

628
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:17,101
You taught me that fighting
is about so much more

629
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:18,750
than just getting the biggest hit in.

630
00:44:21,541 --> 00:44:22,666
Take a seat.

631
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:31,208
You know, martial arts is about joining
your mind, body, and spirit.

632
00:44:31,291 --> 00:44:33,583
It's an extension of your education.

633
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,125
Well, I always wanted to go to school,

634
00:44:36,208 --> 00:44:39,000
but to be honest,
that just wasn't in the cards for me.

635
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:41,208
But I'd be hiding in the back of a gym,

636
00:44:41,291 --> 00:44:44,125
I'd be on a bus reading anyone
that you mentioned.

637
00:44:44,208 --> 00:44:45,916
So why stay underground?

638
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:50,708
- It's all I know.
- Then why do you need me?

639
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:58,333
Because I need to beat Jax,
and that's where he lives.

640
00:44:58,416 --> 00:44:59,666
That's what this is about.

641
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:01,833
He betrayed me. And he betrayed you!

642
00:45:01,916 --> 00:45:04,208
- You have every right to want...
- Sienna, I...

643
00:45:04,291 --> 00:45:08,416
Come on. Julian,
this could really put us back on the map.

644
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,500
When Kayden wins,
he's gonna go legit here,

645
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,708
and the fighters
are gonna flock from everywhere

646
00:45:13,791 --> 00:45:15,500
hoping for the same thing.

647
00:45:16,166 --> 00:45:19,000
You're gonna have your champ
and a following.

648
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:21,708
My champ and a following?
It's not about ego.

649
00:45:22,708 --> 00:45:25,000
Come on.

650
00:45:25,083 --> 00:45:26,083
Please.

651
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:29,500
We really need your help.

652
00:45:29,583 --> 00:45:33,375
I really need your help.

653
00:45:33,458 --> 00:45:34,916
Let me be clear.

654
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,291
I will never support the underground.

655
00:45:41,083 --> 00:45:42,125
But I support you.

656
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:46,041
You've gotta choose.

657
00:45:46,125 --> 00:45:49,291
Are you fighters or whatever this is?

658
00:45:49,375 --> 00:45:50,916
Because if you train in this gym,

659
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,500
it has to be as professionals.

660
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:56,416
Mixing business with pleasure
didn't work out for you last time.

661
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:00,958
And in the cage,
a fraction of a second of distraction

662
00:46:01,833 --> 00:46:03,083
can get you killed.

663
00:46:12,916 --> 00:46:14,291
Nice!

664
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,250
Yes! Nice.

665
00:46:48,458 --> 00:46:52,291
- You see how he's coming…
- Come on. Breathe.

666
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:12,000
- Hey.
- Sienna.

667
00:47:12,083 --> 00:47:13,875
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.

668
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:17,000
- I'm just happy you're here.
- Of course.

669
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:19,708
You actually just missed my mom.
She's been dying to meet you.

670
00:47:19,791 --> 00:47:21,583
- Really?
- Yeah, Kayden may have

671
00:47:21,666 --> 00:47:23,625
mentioned your name once or twice.

672
00:47:25,541 --> 00:47:28,375
- No pressure. No.
- No pressure.

673
00:47:30,291 --> 00:47:32,250
Here's the dress we picked.

674
00:47:33,291 --> 00:47:34,833
- Wow.
- Yeah.

675
00:47:34,916 --> 00:47:38,000
But one of my bridesmaids

676
00:47:38,083 --> 00:47:40,666
asked if she could design the dresses.

677
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:42,208
- Good one.
- Gotcha.

678
00:47:42,291 --> 00:47:44,208
- Now this is beautiful.
- Way better, right?

679
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:45,708
Yes.

680
00:47:45,791 --> 00:47:47,958
I thought you'd look great
in this neckline.

681
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:50,458
You know what? This one's fine.

682
00:47:50,541 --> 00:47:52,291
This one's actually better than fine.

683
00:47:52,375 --> 00:47:53,833
- Mm.
- Yep.

684
00:47:53,916 --> 00:47:55,416
You didn't care to mention this?

685
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:59,208
I love you both, and it's my big day.

686
00:47:59,291 --> 00:48:02,291
So deal with it, okay? Thank you.

687
00:48:09,458 --> 00:48:11,750
Look, I'm sorry you feel betrayed...

688
00:48:11,833 --> 00:48:13,625
That's not a good way to start an apology,

689
00:48:13,708 --> 00:48:15,750
dodging responsibility.

690
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:19,458
Okay. I am sorry I betrayed you.

691
00:48:19,541 --> 00:48:23,208
I know how much you sacrificed
to make sure I was okay.

692
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:26,166
But, Sienna,
it has been so hard living in your shadow,

693
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:29,416
and Jax was the first person
to pay attention to me.

694
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,958
I'm just trying to figure out who I am.

695
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,500
By what? Being tied up and degraded?

696
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,833
He asks if I want it.

697
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:38,476
But you don't know what you want, Beth.

698
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,875
- You're 18!
- Oh, and you do?

699
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:42,416
I don't! Uh, no, I don't!

700
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,416
I know there's a difference
between liking it rough

701
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,416
and manipulating women to serve your ego.

702
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,059
You know, Si, it's not about you.
Just stay out of it.

703
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:50,583
Beth, it's not about you either.

704
00:48:50,666 --> 00:48:52,416
This is about Jax

705
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,791
and the pleasure he gets
from taking our power.

706
00:48:55,875 --> 00:48:58,375
He loves me.

707
00:49:00,541 --> 00:49:02,625
<i>I knew what she was going through</i>

708
00:49:02,708 --> 00:49:05,250
<i>and that it was gonna get worse.</i>

709
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:07,583
<i>But when you're that far gone,</i>

710
00:49:07,666 --> 00:49:10,083
<i>only you can decide
when you're ready for help.</i>

711
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,708
You carb-loading there, lucky?

712
00:49:24,291 --> 00:49:27,208
Don't worry about it.
Why aren't you at the gym?

713
00:49:27,291 --> 00:49:30,000
- Miss me?
- I already put in eight hours today.

714
00:49:30,083 --> 00:49:32,291
I'm supposed to take the next 24 off.

715
00:49:32,375 --> 00:49:34,392
Unless, of course, you changed your mind
about having a rest day.

716
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:36,916
No. Definitely not.

717
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,000
You okay?

718
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:46,416
- Great.
- Yeah?

719
00:49:48,625 --> 00:49:51,375
Uh, listen,

720
00:49:53,083 --> 00:49:55,208
I'm here if you want
to talk about anything.

721
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:01,875
It's just Beth.

722
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:06,267
I swear, it's like she's living
on another fucking planet.

723
00:50:06,291 --> 00:50:09,166
Like, in what world
does she not see what he's doing?

724
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:11,833
She saw what he did to me,

725
00:50:11,916 --> 00:50:14,708
chipping away at my self-esteem
and gaslighting me.

726
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:22,291
Uh, I'll get this one.

727
00:50:29,083 --> 00:50:32,000
- Who is that?
- It's no one.

728
00:50:32,083 --> 00:50:33,208
Oh, come on, Kayden.

729
00:50:33,291 --> 00:50:36,000
I open up to you,
and you're still a vault?

730
00:50:36,083 --> 00:50:38,833
Good to see the dynamic duo
back together again.

731
00:50:38,916 --> 00:50:40,333
Can I get you anything?

732
00:50:46,416 --> 00:50:48,500
I know you two are low-key
fight clubbing it,

733
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:50,875
and it's kind of cool
to know people that are so hard.

734
00:50:50,958 --> 00:50:53,583
But do you have to be so hard
on each other?

735
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:35,083
<i>Why did it bother me so much
that Kayden wouldn't let me in?</i>

736
00:51:35,166 --> 00:51:39,000
<i>His whole brooding,
mysterious thing was getting to me.</i>

737
00:51:39,083 --> 00:51:42,125
<i>But, no, we were in this to beat Jax.</i>

738
00:51:42,208 --> 00:51:44,833
<i>It was purely a business transaction,</i>

739
00:51:44,916 --> 00:51:46,458
<i>and that's all I wanted.</i>

740
00:51:46,541 --> 00:51:48,000
- Hey.
- <i>Right?</i>

741
00:51:48,083 --> 00:51:49,583
Sienna.

742
00:51:49,666 --> 00:51:52,291
Hey, Sienna.

743
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:54,916
It's me!

744
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,184
I could have snapped your wrist.

745
00:51:58,208 --> 00:51:59,833
Were you... have you been following me?

746
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:03,500
No. Yeah. Uh...

747
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:10,541
I'm sorry I got mad.

748
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,791
I mean, don't. Don't do that.

749
00:52:14,875 --> 00:52:19,625
- Do what?
- That. That... that look.

750
00:52:19,708 --> 00:52:21,416
- What? That's my face.
- I…

751
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,708
I know. It's just…

752
00:52:39,375 --> 00:52:41,416
You're the last thing on my mind at night.

753
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,666
The first thing in the morning.

754
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:47,000
You are the smartest,

755
00:52:47,083 --> 00:52:49,416
strongest, most insanely stubborn,

756
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,166
beautiful force of a woman
I have ever met,

757
00:52:53,291 --> 00:52:55,208
and it kills me knowing
that I can't give you

758
00:52:55,291 --> 00:52:57,583
everything that you deserve.

759
00:52:57,666 --> 00:53:00,750
Kayden, people are allowed to change…

760
00:53:02,291 --> 00:53:06,958
…grow, make mistakes, and then move on.

761
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:10,684
Whatever it is that you've gone through

762
00:53:10,708 --> 00:53:13,333
that's made the person
standing in front of me,

763
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,708
it's enough.

764
00:53:18,416 --> 00:53:20,083
You're enough.

765
00:53:49,708 --> 00:53:51,500
Tell me to stop and I will.

766
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:53,041
No way.

767
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:46,083
Julian's gonna kill us.

768
00:55:47,916 --> 00:55:49,291
Not if he doesn't know.

769
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,916
He'll know.

770
00:56:39,916 --> 00:56:42,958
Um, we can just pretend it never happened

771
00:56:43,041 --> 00:56:46,708
if you have regrets or anything.

772
00:56:51,833 --> 00:56:54,125
What? No.

773
00:56:56,916 --> 00:57:01,416
The cheese... cheese is still melting,

774
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,708
but you should try this.

775
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:06,916
- Hot.
- Mm.

776
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,583
It is my take on migas.

777
00:57:09,958 --> 00:57:11,625
- Mmm.
- Yep.

778
00:57:11,708 --> 00:57:13,666
Homemade tortilla chips,
caramelized onions,

779
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:15,416
peppers, eggs,

780
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,583
anything really
that I want to put on there.

781
00:57:17,666 --> 00:57:19,250
Oh, you want cilantro?

782
00:57:19,333 --> 00:57:20,750
No. Never.

783
00:57:20,833 --> 00:57:23,083
Really?

784
00:57:23,166 --> 00:57:24,833
- You like cilantro?
- I love cilantro.

785
00:57:24,916 --> 00:57:28,000
- Oh, no.
- You think you know someone.

786
00:57:28,083 --> 00:57:31,083
Well, I didn't know you were such a chef.

787
00:57:31,166 --> 00:57:35,708
Yeah, uh, it's what I wanted
to be when I was younger.

788
00:57:37,083 --> 00:57:39,375
It's just not the same cooking for one.

789
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,833
Well, you're really good at it.

790
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:46,500
When I woke up I realized…

791
00:57:48,083 --> 00:57:50,291
…I don't want just one night with you.

792
00:57:51,541 --> 00:57:52,708
But…

793
00:57:58,166 --> 00:57:59,291
No buts.

794
00:58:23,916 --> 00:58:25,708
All right, go.

795
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:18,333
That's it. Light on your feet.

796
00:59:20,083 --> 00:59:22,625
- You're late.
- Sorry, boss, uh, we...

797
00:59:22,708 --> 00:59:25,541
Got caught up in each other?
Forgot what you're meant to be doing?

798
00:59:25,625 --> 00:59:28,833
I mean, if you're not gonna take this
seriously, find somewhere else to train.

799
00:59:28,916 --> 00:59:30,642
- Come on.
- Okay? I gave you the conditions, okay?

800
00:59:30,666 --> 00:59:32,000
I said keep it professional.

801
00:59:32,083 --> 00:59:33,583
But you didn't do that, did you?

802
00:59:33,666 --> 00:59:36,458
We've been down this road before, Sienna.

803
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:40,625
Julian, come on.

804
00:59:40,708 --> 00:59:42,833
Give me a jab. Jab cross.

805
00:59:42,916 --> 00:59:44,750
Look, I really do need your help.

806
00:59:44,833 --> 00:59:46,708
You don't know what you need.

807
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:48,351
And somebody is gonna get hurt, Sienna.

808
00:59:48,416 --> 00:59:50,458
Sir, this is just as much
my fault as it is hers.

809
00:59:50,541 --> 00:59:51,875
Hey, this is between us.

810
00:59:51,958 --> 00:59:54,291
Jab. Switch.

811
00:59:56,625 --> 00:59:58,791
Oh, nice shot.

812
00:59:58,875 --> 00:59:59,875
Come on.

813
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:02,958
Julian, I'm really sorry.

814
01:00:06,041 --> 01:00:07,708
I am.

815
01:00:07,791 --> 01:00:09,416
Did you see Jax's fight the other night?

816
01:00:14,833 --> 01:00:15,913
It's all over the Internet.

817
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:25,583
Oh!

818
01:00:33,833 --> 01:00:37,708
<i>…to take on Kayden "The Killer" Williams!</i>

819
01:00:38,458 --> 01:00:40,208
You really want to be a part of this?

820
01:00:40,291 --> 01:00:41,958
You're gonna get yourself killed.

821
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:46,000
You got one week.

822
01:00:46,083 --> 01:00:48,125
Are you ready to send him into that?

823
01:00:50,708 --> 01:00:51,916
We'll be ready.

824
01:00:57,041 --> 01:01:00,833
Buckle down and you can stay,

825
01:01:00,916 --> 01:01:02,708
but no more warnings.

826
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:31,541
Uh-huh.

827
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,625
Nice. Yep, down.

828
01:01:37,708 --> 01:01:39,083
Nice.

829
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:01,541
That's good.

830
01:02:01,625 --> 01:02:03,541
Hey, can you give us a hand for a sec?

831
01:02:03,625 --> 01:02:05,250
Yeah, sure. Keep going.

832
01:02:05,333 --> 01:02:07,166
Make sure you switch up the angles.

833
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:11,000
Okay, this is Athena.
She's got a fight coming up.

834
01:02:11,083 --> 01:02:12,541
I wanna get her on her feet.

835
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:15,000
Yeah. Sure.

836
01:02:17,625 --> 01:02:21,333
Okay, ladies, you ready?

837
01:02:21,416 --> 01:02:23,875
Okay, touch gloves.

838
01:02:23,958 --> 01:02:25,166
And go!

839
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,500
Bring her to you, Athena.

840
01:02:35,666 --> 01:02:37,125
Cover.

841
01:02:39,708 --> 01:02:40,916
Use the ring.

842
01:02:43,625 --> 01:02:45,458
Step back.

843
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:50,333
Watch those leg kicks and don't project.

844
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:11,333
Nice. Good kick.

845
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,416
Keep your guard up.

846
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:18,625
Cover. Come on.

847
01:03:18,708 --> 01:03:20,708
Athena, use the fence.

848
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,958
Keep going. The foot...

849
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:33,708
Take her to ground.

850
01:03:39,291 --> 01:03:40,541
Okay, get off the ropes.

851
01:03:42,291 --> 01:03:44,083
Come on, take it.

852
01:03:45,125 --> 01:03:46,833
Fight your way out.

853
01:04:20,375 --> 01:04:21,708
Good fight.

854
01:04:29,625 --> 01:04:30,625
What?

855
01:04:32,458 --> 01:04:35,208
- It's nothing.
- It was nothing?

856
01:04:35,291 --> 01:04:37,166
She's won all three fights this year.

857
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:39,708
You just took her down.

858
01:04:41,708 --> 01:04:43,708
It's nothing.

859
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:49,666
Well, let me know when
you're ready to get serious.

860
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:56,083
I didn't say stop.

861
01:05:08,083 --> 01:05:09,500
Wow.

862
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,666
Need some help?

863
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,208
Yeah, you know how to do this?

864
01:05:23,291 --> 01:05:26,000
No, not really.

865
01:05:26,083 --> 01:05:28,208
But I YouTubed it,

866
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:30,916
so let's see.

867
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Mm-hmm.

868
01:05:33,083 --> 01:05:35,083
This one goes behind.

869
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,708
Across.

870
01:05:42,708 --> 01:05:43,916
There.

871
01:05:49,916 --> 01:05:50,916
All right.

872
01:05:56,916 --> 01:05:59,875
Look at you. Look at you.

873
01:06:05,916 --> 01:06:09,041
I'm really glad we stayed
for the reception.

874
01:06:09,125 --> 01:06:13,208
Slink off to the shadows
when things get social?

875
01:06:13,291 --> 01:06:14,625
- It's not me.
- Oh, yeah.

876
01:06:14,708 --> 01:06:16,416
- You? I'm very social.
- No.

877
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,208
Oh, yeah, definitely.

878
01:06:22,708 --> 01:06:24,083
I've missed this.

879
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:26,916
I'm here.

880
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,291
Forever?

881
01:06:32,916 --> 01:06:34,083
I mean it.

882
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:38,291
Do you really see that happening for us?

883
01:06:41,625 --> 01:06:43,500
Go big or go home, lucky.

884
01:06:58,083 --> 01:07:00,083
There she is.

885
01:07:01,291 --> 01:07:03,708
You clean up nice, princess.

886
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:08,500
Come on. I can't even get a hello?

887
01:07:10,291 --> 01:07:13,291
- Did Beth invite you?
- Beth?

888
01:07:15,166 --> 01:07:17,208
- I'm kidding.
- Ha, ha.

889
01:07:17,291 --> 01:07:19,416
Women are disposable.
You're a real comedian.

890
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:21,875
Si, now that's what I love about you.

891
01:07:21,958 --> 01:07:24,041
Never afraid to tell it like it is.

892
01:07:24,125 --> 01:07:26,291
I miss that fire.

893
01:07:28,833 --> 01:07:32,291
I don't know, maybe this wedding stuff
is making me all sentimental.

894
01:07:34,291 --> 01:07:36,500
- This was supposed to be us.
- Mm.

895
01:07:37,791 --> 01:07:41,625
Me and you? Rebel champions?

896
01:07:41,708 --> 01:07:45,333
Rebels stand for something.
You can't even stand up.

897
01:07:45,416 --> 01:07:47,083
Okay, Jax, you need to go home.

898
01:07:47,166 --> 01:07:51,125
Sienna, Sienna, I know I'm not perfect.

899
01:07:51,208 --> 01:07:55,541
Neither of us were. But we were good.

900
01:07:55,625 --> 01:07:57,083
We could be great.

901
01:07:58,708 --> 01:07:59,916
I know it.

902
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:04,625
How many times
do I have to tell you I'm done?

903
01:08:04,708 --> 01:08:07,291
It's kinda mixed signals
when you keep coming back.

904
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,333
Well, consider this me breaking the cycle.

905
01:08:12,125 --> 01:08:14,165
- What's going on, Sienna?
- Come on, let's just go.

906
01:08:14,208 --> 01:08:16,958
You know she's just using you
to get back at me, right?

907
01:08:17,041 --> 01:08:20,208
What, are you hurt?

908
01:08:20,291 --> 01:08:22,000
You thought there was something more?

909
01:08:22,083 --> 01:08:23,291
That's not how she operates.

910
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:25,416
She may look like she's on the sidelines,

911
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:27,309
- but she's the one calling the shots.
- Jax, stop.

912
01:08:27,333 --> 01:08:30,000
You're a pawn, dude.
I'll prove it to you right now.

913
01:08:30,083 --> 01:08:31,750
- Fight me.
- Let's go.

914
01:08:31,833 --> 01:08:33,958
See if she sticks around afterwards.

915
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,958
I'm not gonna fight you, man.
This is a wedding.

916
01:08:37,041 --> 01:08:39,208
Respect the families.
Save it for tomorrow.

917
01:08:39,291 --> 01:08:41,125
The fuck do you know
about respecting family?

918
01:08:41,208 --> 01:08:43,708
Killed yours, didn't you? Your mom, right?

919
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:52,125
- Motherfucker.
- Hey!

920
01:09:09,375 --> 01:09:12,208
- Get off.
- Dude. Hey, calm down.

921
01:09:12,291 --> 01:09:15,625
- Fuck!
- Go on. Get out of here.

922
01:09:15,708 --> 01:09:17,625
Get over here. I'll fucking kill you.

923
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:25,625
- No!
- You need to get out.

924
01:09:25,708 --> 01:09:27,250
Get off me!

925
01:09:27,333 --> 01:09:29,416
- Let me see. Let me see.
- Kayden!

926
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,416
You guys enjoying the show?

927
01:09:38,666 --> 01:09:41,083
Seriously, dude, what is wrong with you?

928
01:09:43,458 --> 01:09:46,208
- Kayden. Kayden, wait!
- Fuck that guy.

929
01:09:46,291 --> 01:09:48,625
He doesn't know
anything about me or my mom

930
01:09:48,708 --> 01:09:51,625
- or my life or any...
- Neither do I.

931
01:09:51,708 --> 01:09:55,125
So talk to me. Tell me.

932
01:10:05,083 --> 01:10:07,541
That's my mom, okay?

933
01:10:07,625 --> 01:10:09,916
She raised me by herself.

934
01:10:10,958 --> 01:10:12,838
She worked three jobs
to keep food on the table,

935
01:10:12,916 --> 01:10:14,250
and I was just a piece of shit.

936
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:17,208
One night, I got really drunk at a party,

937
01:10:17,291 --> 01:10:20,083
and, uh, she left work to come find me,

938
01:10:20,166 --> 01:10:23,375
and on the way
she got hit by a drunk driver.

939
01:10:23,458 --> 01:10:26,625
- And just like that, gone.
- You couldn't have known...

940
01:10:26,708 --> 01:10:30,041
And everything that she did for me?
That's how I repaid her.

941
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:31,833
Now I'm just a high school dropout

942
01:10:31,916 --> 01:10:33,684
that gets beat up in
underground fights for money.

943
01:10:33,708 --> 01:10:35,750
She'd be really proud of that,
wouldn't she?

944
01:10:39,833 --> 01:10:43,208
What do you want from me, Sienna?

945
01:10:43,291 --> 01:10:45,833
I put everything that I have
into these fights.

946
01:10:46,791 --> 01:10:49,833
Everything. What do you want?

947
01:10:49,916 --> 01:10:52,833
'Cause I have nothing left to give,

948
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:55,375
and I am not gonna be
another person's charity case.

949
01:10:55,458 --> 01:10:59,083
You're not a charity case, Kayden.

950
01:11:01,083 --> 01:11:03,833
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't! No, no, no.

951
01:11:03,916 --> 01:11:07,708
No, no.
That is the last thing I want... pity.

952
01:11:09,708 --> 01:11:11,125
Definitely not yours,

953
01:11:13,041 --> 01:11:16,458
from the way you pity yourself so much
it keeps you chasing that asshole.

954
01:11:16,541 --> 01:11:18,500
Excuse me?

955
01:11:18,583 --> 01:11:22,166
You think you're so tough,
but you're just hiding.

956
01:11:22,250 --> 01:11:25,000
Oh, says... says the brave hero

957
01:11:25,083 --> 01:11:26,875
just locked up in a basement

958
01:11:26,958 --> 01:11:28,958
haunted by his own ghost waiting to die.

959
01:11:29,041 --> 01:11:32,625
You forced your way into my life!

960
01:11:32,708 --> 01:11:35,000
I didn't ask for that,
and I don't need you.

961
01:11:35,083 --> 01:11:38,000
Really? You don't need me? Because
the last fight before me, you lost.

962
01:11:38,083 --> 01:11:39,916
- Wait.
- Ouch.

963
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:44,708
- That feels broken.
- Don't.

964
01:11:44,791 --> 01:11:48,208
I'm gonna do this on my own.
Don't come tomorrow.

965
01:11:48,291 --> 01:11:51,000
Tomorrow? What?
You can't fight with a broken rib.

966
01:11:51,083 --> 01:11:53,000
What does it matter to you if I lose?

967
01:11:53,083 --> 01:11:56,416
'Cause we don't have anything
after tomorrow, do we?

968
01:12:07,125 --> 01:12:09,708
Have fun on your suicide mission!

969
01:12:13,916 --> 01:12:15,291
Fuck.

970
01:13:00,958 --> 01:13:02,708
You heading out?

971
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,375
You're a professional, Sienna.

972
01:13:10,916 --> 01:13:12,875
We don't abandon our fighters.

973
01:13:13,875 --> 01:13:15,625
Let's get through this fight,

974
01:13:15,708 --> 01:13:17,791
and then we'll focus on the next chapter.

975
01:13:17,875 --> 01:13:20,708
But tonight he needs you.

976
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:42,916
- You need a hand?
- Julian.

977
01:13:44,625 --> 01:13:46,833
I thought you didn't want
anyone to know about this.

978
01:13:46,916 --> 01:13:48,208
Well, you know, fuck 'em.

979
01:13:55,916 --> 01:13:58,625
Hey, what the hell happened?
That's a crack.

980
01:13:58,708 --> 01:14:00,958
You can't fight like that.

981
01:14:01,041 --> 01:14:02,625
Pacquiao did it. I'll be fine.

982
01:14:02,708 --> 01:14:05,208
You know, if he gets a hit in,
it'll puncture a lung.

983
01:14:05,291 --> 01:14:08,416
- It could be fatal.
- Then I better not let him hit me.

984
01:14:10,708 --> 01:14:14,333
Next up, The Killer!

985
01:14:14,416 --> 01:14:16,708
You have any last words of advice?

986
01:14:17,875 --> 01:14:19,625
Win.

987
01:14:20,541 --> 01:14:24,000
- You got this, man.
- You got this, Killer. Come on, man.

988
01:14:24,083 --> 01:14:27,000
Kayden "The Killer" Williams
makes his way to the cage

989
01:14:27,083 --> 01:14:30,208
to face off Jax "Deadbeat" Deneris

990
01:14:30,291 --> 01:14:33,416
in the showdown of the century!

991
01:14:40,625 --> 01:14:43,416
Come on, brother, you got this!
You got this!

992
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:44,791
Come on, brother!

993
01:14:44,875 --> 01:14:45,875
This is it, folks,

994
01:14:45,958 --> 01:14:48,166
the moment you've been waiting for!

995
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,708
Ready?

996
01:14:49,791 --> 01:14:53,041
Yo! Oh, that was dirty!

997
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:05,416
- Stay ahead. Nice.
- Hey.

998
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:08,416
Hey. I didn't think you'd come
after last night.

999
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,250
I didn't think so either,

1000
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:12,333
but I couldn't let him do it alone.

1001
01:15:18,916 --> 01:15:21,208
I'm sorry we ruined the night.

1002
01:15:21,291 --> 01:15:23,083
You didn't. Jax did.

1003
01:15:23,166 --> 01:15:25,583
Kayden! Get off the cage! Cover up!

1004
01:15:26,833 --> 01:15:28,416
- Come on!
- Off the cage!

1005
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,500
- Come on!
- Come on, Kayden.

1006
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:34,708
- Off the cage!
- Find the opening!

1007
01:15:36,791 --> 01:15:38,416
Hold him! Don't let him go!

1008
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,291
- Hold that.
- Squeeze, squeeze.

1009
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:47,916
Come on! Squeeze!

1010
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,666
Watch the leg. Watch the leg.

1011
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:53,750
Come on!

1012
01:15:53,833 --> 01:15:56,125
There you go!

1013
01:15:56,208 --> 01:15:58,000
Come on.

1014
01:16:16,541 --> 01:16:18,875
His ribs!

1015
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:22,041
You can do better than that.

1016
01:16:22,125 --> 01:16:23,708
Come on, Killer. Get up!

1017
01:16:23,791 --> 01:16:26,250
- Kayden, you're okay. It's his ribs.
- Aw, Kayden…

1018
01:16:26,333 --> 01:16:30,291
This is your guy?
He's the best you got at UFG?

1019
01:16:30,375 --> 01:16:32,083
Come on, Kayden, you're okay.

1020
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:38,708
Breathe.

1021
01:16:38,791 --> 01:16:42,416
This guy? This guy?

1022
01:16:46,541 --> 01:16:49,083
I thought you came to fight, Killer.

1023
01:16:53,291 --> 01:16:56,625
<i>In that moment,
I realized it didn't matter anymore</i>

1024
01:16:56,708 --> 01:16:58,500
<i>whether we beat Jax.</i>

1025
01:17:00,375 --> 01:17:01,750
<i>We had each other.</i>

1026
01:17:04,583 --> 01:17:06,125
<i>We'd already won.</i>

1027
01:17:13,333 --> 01:17:16,500
Killer's back on his feet.

1028
01:17:16,583 --> 01:17:18,125
He's not ready to give up.

1029
01:17:21,666 --> 01:17:23,916
- Nice! Off the cage!
- You got this. Stay grounded!

1030
01:18:05,083 --> 01:18:06,750
Go.

1031
01:18:13,708 --> 01:18:16,000
Yes!

1032
01:18:16,083 --> 01:18:17,625
The Killer wins!

1033
01:18:17,708 --> 01:18:21,125
Yes!

1034
01:18:21,208 --> 01:18:23,333
<i>The defending champion…</i>

1035
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:26,625
<i>Remember when I said
winning didn't matter?</i>

1036
01:18:26,708 --> 01:18:27,708
<i>I meant it.</i>

1037
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:31,500
<i>But, damn, this felt good.</i>

1038
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:37,291
Killer, Killer, Killer, Killer, Killer!

1039
01:18:38,416 --> 01:18:40,208
You did it.

1040
01:18:40,291 --> 01:18:41,708
We did it.

1041
01:18:44,958 --> 01:18:48,625
<i>And this felt even better.</i>

1042
01:18:59,791 --> 01:19:01,750
Killer!

1043
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:12,000
Oh, my God. Is she breathing?

1044
01:19:12,083 --> 01:19:13,916
Sienna. Come on.

1045
01:19:15,208 --> 01:19:17,291
Please, please, please, don't do this.

1046
01:19:17,375 --> 01:19:19,166
Fuck, man. Fuck!

1047
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:23,958
Call an ambulance! Call an ambulance!

1048
01:19:30,291 --> 01:19:33,750
<i>Dr. Robertson to the ER immediately.</i>

1049
01:20:13,291 --> 01:20:14,583
You guys, she's up.

1050
01:20:15,791 --> 01:20:18,083
Sienna, can you hear me?

1051
01:20:18,166 --> 01:20:21,333
It's Beth. I'm right here.

1052
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:23,375
You've been out for, like, three days.

1053
01:20:26,166 --> 01:20:28,083
Can we... can we get you anything?

1054
01:20:30,666 --> 01:20:33,125
Go on your honeymoon.

1055
01:20:35,166 --> 01:20:38,583
We got her. Go. It's fine.

1056
01:20:45,708 --> 01:20:49,000
- You're gonna be okay.
- Where is he?

1057
01:20:49,083 --> 01:20:52,583
He waited
until you were in the clear, but…

1058
01:20:54,875 --> 01:20:56,916
He left you this.

1059
01:21:12,291 --> 01:21:15,458
<i>I've always known there's danger
in loving someone too much,</i>

1060
01:21:15,541 --> 01:21:18,041
<i>the daily sacrifices
that turn into so much more.</i>

1061
01:21:18,125 --> 01:21:19,333
It's okay.

1062
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:21,416
<i>Holding you in my arms,</i>

1063
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:23,833
<i>I saw what I was doing to you,</i>

1064
01:21:23,916 --> 01:21:28,375
<i>and I know that if...
When you come back from this,</i>

1065
01:21:29,291 --> 01:21:31,208
<i>you'll continue to put yourself
in my shadow</i>

1066
01:21:31,291 --> 01:21:33,625
<i>just as you did with Jax.</i>

1067
01:21:33,708 --> 01:21:35,791
<i>You deserve so much more than that,</i>

1068
01:21:36,875 --> 01:21:39,291
<i>and I can be a part of holding you back.</i>

1069
01:21:40,666 --> 01:21:43,291
<i>You're one of the great ones, Sienna.</i>

1070
01:22:02,208 --> 01:22:03,208
Hey.

1071
01:22:08,875 --> 01:22:11,291
Looks like our roles are reversed, huh?

1072
01:22:12,916 --> 01:22:14,833
You gonna nurse me back to health?

1073
01:22:14,916 --> 01:22:17,541
If you want.

1074
01:22:17,625 --> 01:22:19,000
I'll be here for you every day.

1075
01:22:19,083 --> 01:22:23,458
Seriously? You could've
saved yourself the trip.

1076
01:22:24,791 --> 01:22:27,291
No, it's not actually why I'm here,

1077
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:28,833
but you did ask.

1078
01:22:28,916 --> 01:22:32,375
- You saw an opening?
- Pretty much.

1079
01:22:34,375 --> 01:22:36,291
Cookie?

1080
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:43,916
Okay.

1081
01:22:47,333 --> 01:22:48,916
I, um…

1082
01:22:53,541 --> 01:22:55,625
I came to say that I'm sorry.

1083
01:22:56,708 --> 01:22:58,208
It was an accident.

1084
01:22:58,291 --> 01:23:00,208
I didn't see you, Sienna.

1085
01:23:00,291 --> 01:23:02,708
And by the time that I did see you…

1086
01:23:04,083 --> 01:23:07,208
The thought that I could've killed you…

1087
01:23:07,291 --> 01:23:10,375
Yeah. You could have.

1088
01:23:15,583 --> 01:23:17,708
But I…

1089
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:23,666
I forgive you for everything.

1090
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:27,458
- I love you.
- No, you don't.

1091
01:23:28,166 --> 01:23:30,875
You took my anger,
and you tried to control me with it,

1092
01:23:30,958 --> 01:23:35,333
and you called that love,
and that's not what love is.

1093
01:23:35,416 --> 01:23:38,291
But that doesn't mean
that you can never find it.

1094
01:23:40,083 --> 01:23:42,833
You just have to look
inside yourself, Jax.

1095
01:23:44,875 --> 01:23:47,625
Just try to fix
what's broken inside of you

1096
01:23:48,541 --> 01:23:50,583
and stop trying to break other people

1097
01:23:50,666 --> 01:23:52,291
to make yourself feel whole.

1098
01:23:55,708 --> 01:23:57,333
Can I ask you something?

1099
01:23:57,416 --> 01:23:59,708
You think there's still a chance?

1100
01:23:59,791 --> 01:24:02,000
Of what?

1101
01:24:03,083 --> 01:24:04,958
For me to be redeemed?

1102
01:24:07,583 --> 01:24:09,541
No one is beyond redemption.

1103
01:24:12,375 --> 01:24:14,333
But I wouldn't bet my money on it.

1104
01:24:14,416 --> 01:24:17,166
Yeah.

1105
01:24:27,208 --> 01:24:28,916
You're probably right.

1106
01:24:37,708 --> 01:24:41,500
<i>It hurt, hearing those words,</i>

1107
01:24:42,541 --> 01:24:44,250
<i>feeling abandoned,</i>

1108
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:48,708
<i>but it hurt even more
knowing he was right.</i>

1109
01:24:50,916 --> 01:24:52,250
<i>The first step in recovery</i>

1110
01:24:52,333 --> 01:24:54,958
<i>is admitting you have a problem.</i>

1111
01:24:56,541 --> 01:24:59,125
<i>I was an addict.</i>

1112
01:25:02,333 --> 01:25:06,583
<i>I'd been obsessed with Jax,
convinced it was love,</i>

1113
01:25:06,666 --> 01:25:08,083
<i>and my need for revenge</i>

1114
01:25:08,166 --> 01:25:10,625
<i>had thrown me even further off track.</i>

1115
01:25:10,708 --> 01:25:14,000
<i>With Kayden it felt different,</i>

1116
01:25:14,083 --> 01:25:15,625
<i>but I was still fighting for others</i>

1117
01:25:15,708 --> 01:25:17,458
<i>when I needed to fight for myself.</i>

1118
01:25:23,416 --> 01:25:25,291
<i>I'd lost sight of who I was,</i>

1119
01:25:26,166 --> 01:25:27,500
<i>what I wanted.</i>

1120
01:25:52,333 --> 01:25:54,166
<i>I wasn't one to forget,</i>

1121
01:25:54,958 --> 01:25:57,125
<i>but it cost me nothing to forgive.</i>

1122
01:26:03,666 --> 01:26:05,958
All right.

1123
01:26:06,041 --> 01:26:09,750
- Not gourmet, but here you go.
- Thank you.

1124
01:26:09,833 --> 01:26:13,458
- Mm-hmm.
- I like your hair.

1125
01:26:13,541 --> 01:26:16,708
- It's very me, right?
- Yeah.

1126
01:26:26,125 --> 01:26:28,375
I ended things with Jax.

1127
01:26:31,291 --> 01:26:33,416
Well, aren't you gonna say I told you so?

1128
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:36,791
I'm so proud of you.

1129
01:26:40,916 --> 01:26:43,166
Thanks, Si.

1130
01:26:43,916 --> 01:26:46,750
Now you've gotta focus on yourself.

1131
01:26:47,625 --> 01:26:48,958
I am.

1132
01:26:58,375 --> 01:27:01,208
Hey, whoa! Easy there, killer.

1133
01:27:01,291 --> 01:27:02,875
Hey, I'm not Killer.

1134
01:27:02,958 --> 01:27:06,666
- What'd he call you? Lucky?
- Exactly. It's ironic.

1135
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:09,958
- Go again?
- Slow and steady.

1136
01:27:25,625 --> 01:27:27,541
I'll give you a minute.

1137
01:27:35,916 --> 01:27:39,416
- You look good up there.
- That? I was just warming up.

1138
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,166
Heard you were in Philly.

1139
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:44,916
Yeah. Yeah, I have an uncle up there.

1140
01:27:45,875 --> 01:27:47,916
I'm glad it worked out for you.

1141
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,208
I just figured you be better off

1142
01:27:50,291 --> 01:27:52,791
if I wasn't here messing everything up.

1143
01:27:54,083 --> 01:27:57,125
- How selfless.
- I know. I know.

1144
01:27:57,208 --> 01:27:59,666
Now I know that running away

1145
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:02,541
was exactly the wrong thing to do.

1146
01:28:03,541 --> 01:28:05,583
And I was a coward.

1147
01:28:07,458 --> 01:28:08,458
I'm sorry.

1148
01:28:10,208 --> 01:28:12,666
I'm sorry that I ran away
when you needed me the most.

1149
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:15,166
And if you can't forgive me, that's okay.

1150
01:28:15,250 --> 01:28:17,708
I just want what's best for you.

1151
01:28:20,708 --> 01:28:23,375
I love you, Sienna.

1152
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:26,416
I'm happy you're fighting.

1153
01:28:30,291 --> 01:28:33,083
I'd wish you luck, but who needs it when
they got your skills?

1154
01:28:37,583 --> 01:28:39,458
I read your letter.

1155
01:28:42,541 --> 01:28:44,416
I'm not gonna lie, I was so mad.

1156
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:48,791
But I was just holding on to that anger
towards Jax,

1157
01:28:48,875 --> 01:28:51,833
and it was holding me back.

1158
01:28:51,916 --> 01:28:57,125
So, I don't know,
maybe I should be thanking you.

1159
01:28:57,208 --> 01:29:02,916
Well, no, but, um, you know what I mean.

1160
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:08,041
I'm not doing the underground
thing anymore.

1161
01:29:09,416 --> 01:29:10,833
I applied to school in the fall.

1162
01:29:10,916 --> 01:29:13,083
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1163
01:29:13,166 --> 01:29:15,833
- That's really good.
- Yeah.

1164
01:29:15,916 --> 01:29:19,291
Um, in Philly?

1165
01:29:21,291 --> 01:29:22,541
Springfield.

1166
01:29:22,625 --> 01:29:27,208
So if you happen to know anyone

1167
01:29:27,291 --> 01:29:30,416
with a cheap room to rent,

1168
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:33,083
I'd love a recommendation.

1169
01:29:36,375 --> 01:29:38,583
How's it going, Julian?

1170
01:29:38,666 --> 01:29:41,291
Well, it's still slow,

1171
01:29:41,375 --> 01:29:43,958
but I appreciate you
leaving me what you did.

1172
01:29:44,041 --> 01:29:46,250
It's not a fight
that I wanted any credit for,

1173
01:29:46,333 --> 01:29:49,166
but it's been keeping my lights on,

1174
01:29:50,333 --> 01:29:53,208
putting off the inevitable, I suppose.

1175
01:29:53,291 --> 01:29:55,291
Not if you have a champion.

1176
01:29:55,375 --> 01:29:58,208
You thinking about turning pro?

1177
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:00,916
Not him.

1178
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:13,500
Me.
