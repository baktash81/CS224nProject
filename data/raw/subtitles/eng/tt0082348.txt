1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,200
ripped by Framarie

2
00:02:26,292 --> 00:02:27,441
Uther!

3
00:02:28,252 --> 00:02:29,287
Merlin!

4
00:02:31,092 --> 00:02:33,811
Merlin, i am the strongest.

5
00:02:33,972 --> 00:02:35,121
i am the one.

6
00:02:48,932 --> 00:02:51,366
The sword! You promised me the sword!

7
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:55,526
And you shall have it,
but to heal, not to hack.

8
00:02:56,652 --> 00:02:57,687
Tomorrow...

9
00:02:57,772 --> 00:02:59,922
...a truce. We meet at the river.

10
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:02,810
Talk! Talk is for lovers, Merlin.

11
00:03:03,212 --> 00:03:05,521
i need a sword to be king.

12
00:03:40,492 --> 00:03:41,720
Show the sword.

13
00:03:48,332 --> 00:03:51,802
Behold the sword of power.

14
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:53,761
Excalibur.

15
00:03:57,772 --> 00:04:00,411
Forged when the world was young...

16
00:04:00,492 --> 00:04:02,528
...and bird, and beast, and flower...

17
00:04:02,612 --> 00:04:04,125
...were one with man...

18
00:04:04,212 --> 00:04:06,851
...and death was but a dream.

19
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:10,131
Speak the words.

20
00:04:11,572 --> 00:04:13,483
One land, one king!

21
00:04:13,612 --> 00:04:15,762
That is my peace, Cornwall.

22
00:04:19,572 --> 00:04:23,451
Lord Uther,
if i yield to the sword of power...

23
00:04:24,372 --> 00:04:25,600
...what will you yield?

24
00:04:25,692 --> 00:04:26,841
Me, yield?

25
00:04:27,212 --> 00:04:29,203
He has given. Now you must.

26
00:04:32,452 --> 00:04:35,205
The land from here to the sea
shall be yours...

27
00:04:35,612 --> 00:04:38,001
...if you enforce the King's will.

28
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,487
Done!

29
00:04:45,612 --> 00:04:46,647
Good.

30
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:50,169
King Uther, let's feast together.
To my castle.

31
00:04:57,732 --> 00:05:00,007
My wife will dance for us.

32
00:05:01,372 --> 00:05:03,567
igrayne, dance!

33
00:05:12,652 --> 00:05:14,643
You may be king, Uther...

34
00:05:15,132 --> 00:05:18,044
...but no queen of yours
could ever match her.

35
00:06:18,892 --> 00:06:19,927
i must have her.

36
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,003
Are you mad? The alliance.

37
00:06:32,012 --> 00:06:33,331
i must have her.

38
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,808
And risk everything you've won?

39
00:06:57,932 --> 00:06:59,285
King Uther.

40
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:28,283
You'll never batter this down...

41
00:07:28,732 --> 00:07:31,007
...and you'll never have igrayne!

42
00:07:32,492 --> 00:07:34,562
Merlin! Where are you?

43
00:07:36,092 --> 00:07:38,481
-Have you found him?
-i haven't.

44
00:07:40,892 --> 00:07:42,484
He's here, all right.

45
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:45,044
He won't show himself.

46
00:07:50,492 --> 00:07:52,050
Where have you been?

47
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:55,081
i have walked my way
since the beginning of time.

48
00:07:55,172 --> 00:07:57,003
Sometimes i give, sometimes i take.

49
00:07:57,092 --> 00:07:58,923
it is mine to know which and when.

50
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:00,889
-You must help me, Merlin!
-Must i?

51
00:08:00,972 --> 00:08:02,325
i am your king.

52
00:08:02,572 --> 00:08:06,167
So you need me again,
now that my truce is wrecked.

53
00:08:06,332 --> 00:08:09,688
Years to build and moments to ruin,
and all for lust.

54
00:08:09,852 --> 00:08:11,365
For igrayne.

55
00:08:12,332 --> 00:08:13,845
One night with her.

56
00:08:15,252 --> 00:08:17,641
You don't understand. You're not a man.

57
00:08:17,772 --> 00:08:20,002
Use the magic! Do it!

58
00:08:24,252 --> 00:08:25,685
igrayne.

59
00:08:29,212 --> 00:08:31,772
You will swear by your true kingship...

60
00:08:32,692 --> 00:08:35,286
...to grant me what i wish.

61
00:08:35,772 --> 00:08:37,410
Then you shall have it.

62
00:08:38,092 --> 00:08:40,083
By Excalibur, i swear it.

63
00:08:40,412 --> 00:08:43,768
What issues from your lust shall be mine.

64
00:08:44,932 --> 00:08:46,001
Swear it again.

65
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,571
i swear it!

66
00:08:57,172 --> 00:08:59,242
They have given up. it's over.

67
00:08:59,452 --> 00:09:00,851
Not quite.

68
00:09:01,052 --> 00:09:03,964
When night falls,
we'll follow them and finish them.

69
00:10:19,532 --> 00:10:21,170
i dreamt of the Dragon.

70
00:10:21,252 --> 00:10:23,129
i have awoken him.

71
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:27,528
Can't you see, all around you,
the Dragon's breath?

72
00:10:46,732 --> 00:10:48,962
We have drawn him out.

73
00:10:49,772 --> 00:10:52,240
The Duke is off to pursue your men.

74
00:10:55,892 --> 00:10:57,803
There he goes.

75
00:10:58,292 --> 00:10:59,247
Good.

76
00:10:59,852 --> 00:11:01,205
Mount your horse.

77
00:11:02,492 --> 00:11:05,450
i will transform you
into the semblance of the Duke.

78
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,369
igrayne will think her husband
has returned.

79
00:11:11,132 --> 00:11:12,884
But the cliff, the sea?

80
00:11:13,612 --> 00:11:15,523
Your lust will hold you up.

81
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:18,122
You will float on the Dragon's breath.

82
00:11:19,052 --> 00:11:20,041
Ride!

83
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:23,160
Ride!

84
00:11:42,972 --> 00:11:45,361
Take on the outer shape of the Duke.

85
00:11:47,452 --> 00:11:48,601
Change!

86
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,771
Transform!

87
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:52,965
Now!

88
00:12:04,012 --> 00:12:05,047
That's it.

89
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:07,527
That's it.

90
00:12:15,412 --> 00:12:16,561
it's the Duke.

91
00:12:17,012 --> 00:12:20,607
The Duke has returned. Open the gates.

92
00:12:20,892 --> 00:12:23,964
Have the horse ready.
i ride out before sunrise.

93
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:33,921
Uther!

94
00:12:34,772 --> 00:12:36,524
Find the King. Find Uther.

95
00:12:43,132 --> 00:12:45,407
Uther, come out and fight.

96
00:12:46,052 --> 00:12:48,964
We're under attack. it's Cornwall.

97
00:12:57,932 --> 00:12:59,524
My father is dead.

98
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:11,768
Hush, Morgana, hush.

99
00:13:19,252 --> 00:13:22,164
My father, my father is dead.

100
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:28,001
Look.

101
00:13:28,092 --> 00:13:29,491
Here's your father.

102
00:13:30,012 --> 00:13:32,003
it was just a dream, little one.

103
00:13:33,692 --> 00:13:34,886
Come, igrayne.

104
00:13:37,212 --> 00:13:38,440
Go to sleep.

105
00:13:48,972 --> 00:13:49,961
My lord.

106
00:14:47,932 --> 00:14:50,321
The future has taken root in the present.

107
00:14:51,612 --> 00:14:52,727
it is done.

108
00:15:03,812 --> 00:15:04,961
When? Where?

109
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:07,288
in the camp of Uther, my lady...

110
00:15:07,612 --> 00:15:09,204
...just after nightfall.

111
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:11,765
it can't be.

112
00:15:12,252 --> 00:15:13,526
He came to me...

113
00:15:13,852 --> 00:15:15,570
...to his bed, last night.

114
00:15:16,572 --> 00:15:18,210
What shall become of us?

115
00:15:19,212 --> 00:15:20,691
Lord Uther, my lady.

116
00:15:21,732 --> 00:15:23,450
it will be for him to say.

117
00:15:26,252 --> 00:15:27,605
Oh, Morgana.

118
00:15:37,852 --> 00:15:39,331
The King. The King.

119
00:15:39,612 --> 00:15:40,601
Wait!

120
00:15:47,932 --> 00:15:48,887
Out!

121
00:15:49,372 --> 00:15:51,602
-What is it, lady?
-A boy, sir.

122
00:15:52,412 --> 00:15:54,243
-Send the girl away.
-She's only a child.

123
00:15:54,332 --> 00:15:55,765
-Out!
-Go, Morgana.

124
00:15:58,492 --> 00:16:00,767
She watches me with her father's eyes.

125
00:16:04,372 --> 00:16:06,966
is it mine or his?

126
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:10,451
A man came to me...

127
00:16:11,332 --> 00:16:12,731
...and loved me...

128
00:16:15,412 --> 00:16:17,050
...and made this child.

129
00:16:19,532 --> 00:16:21,443
i thought it was my husband...

130
00:16:22,332 --> 00:16:24,084
...but he was already dead.

131
00:16:36,052 --> 00:16:38,168
All i know is how to butcher men.

132
00:16:39,772 --> 00:16:42,161
From now on, i shall learn to love them.

133
00:16:43,972 --> 00:16:45,690
i am weary of battle.

134
00:16:49,532 --> 00:16:51,284
i shall stay by his side...

135
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:54,891
...and his mother's.

136
00:16:58,972 --> 00:17:00,087
He's hungry.

137
00:17:13,012 --> 00:17:15,606
Merlin, you come when you're not asked...

138
00:17:15,892 --> 00:17:17,610
...and pay no heed when i call you.

139
00:17:17,692 --> 00:17:20,889
Oh, i have slept for nine moons.

140
00:17:21,932 --> 00:17:23,843
What i did for you wasn't easy.

141
00:17:25,492 --> 00:17:26,925
Now you must pay me.

142
00:17:28,452 --> 00:17:30,283
The child is mine.

143
00:17:31,972 --> 00:17:33,325
You made an oath.

144
00:17:35,372 --> 00:17:37,283
They were hasty words, Merlin.

145
00:17:38,092 --> 00:17:39,730
This is flesh and blood.

146
00:17:41,492 --> 00:17:43,528
Uther, is this true?

147
00:17:43,852 --> 00:17:45,683
Don't let him take the child.

148
00:17:45,812 --> 00:17:47,564
i swore an oath, igrayne.

149
00:17:47,772 --> 00:17:49,490
i made a pact with Merlin.

150
00:17:52,492 --> 00:17:53,607
it was you!

151
00:17:54,812 --> 00:17:56,530
You came to me that night.

152
00:17:57,372 --> 00:17:58,805
You are the father!

153
00:17:59,452 --> 00:18:01,363
it's not for you, Uther...

154
00:18:01,772 --> 00:18:04,366
...hearth and home, wife and child.

155
00:18:08,732 --> 00:18:11,565
To kill and be king, is that all?

156
00:18:11,732 --> 00:18:13,290
Perhaps not even that.

157
00:18:14,932 --> 00:18:17,321
You strike me with words hard as steel.

158
00:18:17,812 --> 00:18:20,326
You betrayed the Duke, you stole his wife...

159
00:18:20,412 --> 00:18:23,290
...you took his castle,
now no one trusts you.

160
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,484
You're not the one, Uther.

161
00:18:27,812 --> 00:18:29,165
Give me the child.

162
00:18:30,332 --> 00:18:31,765
i will protect him.

163
00:18:39,692 --> 00:18:40,681
No!

164
00:18:41,812 --> 00:18:43,086
Why?

165
00:18:44,852 --> 00:18:46,171
Take him.

166
00:18:46,772 --> 00:18:48,410
Take the devil child.

167
00:18:49,532 --> 00:18:50,567
No!

168
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:52,725
Why the baby?

169
00:18:55,772 --> 00:18:58,809
No! Go after him!

170
00:19:00,492 --> 00:19:01,845
That's it.

171
00:19:02,612 --> 00:19:03,647
Sleep now.

172
00:19:04,012 --> 00:19:05,809
Go after him!

173
00:19:06,172 --> 00:19:07,366
Get him back!

174
00:19:07,972 --> 00:19:11,282
Are you the mother and father
of the baby now, Merlin?

175
00:19:29,012 --> 00:19:30,604
Where are you?

176
00:19:35,812 --> 00:19:37,484
i want my son.

177
00:19:42,012 --> 00:19:43,001
Attack!

178
00:19:45,612 --> 00:19:46,647
Ambush!

179
00:19:46,972 --> 00:19:48,724
Help me, Ulfius.

180
00:19:57,172 --> 00:19:59,049
The King's bodyguard! Look out!

181
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:01,088
The King! The King is ambushed!

182
00:20:20,412 --> 00:20:21,447
Excalibur.

183
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:47,281
The sword!

184
00:20:47,572 --> 00:20:48,925
The King's sword.

185
00:21:01,532 --> 00:21:03,966
Merlin, where are you?

186
00:21:05,892 --> 00:21:07,291
Call your Dragon...

187
00:21:07,972 --> 00:21:09,485
...to weave a mist...

188
00:21:10,492 --> 00:21:11,766
...to hide us.

189
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:15,606
Merlin, where are you?

190
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,483
Nobody shall have the sword.

191
00:21:23,292 --> 00:21:26,011
Nobody shall wield Excalibur...

192
00:21:26,132 --> 00:21:27,201
...but me.

193
00:21:44,412 --> 00:21:45,401
Uther!

194
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:50,806
He who draws the sword from the stone,
he shall be king.

195
00:21:54,572 --> 00:21:55,607
Arthur...

196
00:21:56,212 --> 00:21:57,611
...you're the one.

197
00:22:38,972 --> 00:22:40,963
Now remember, my sons,
what i've told you.

198
00:22:41,052 --> 00:22:43,327
Pay no heed to these robber knights.

199
00:22:43,412 --> 00:22:46,484
You, Kay, be brave and honest
and merciful...

200
00:22:46,972 --> 00:22:48,485
...as a knight should be.

201
00:22:48,572 --> 00:22:51,564
And you, Arthur, be modest and true...

202
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:55,609
...and help your brother
to uphold the good name of Morven.

203
00:23:28,572 --> 00:23:30,449
i remember my first joust.

204
00:23:30,532 --> 00:23:32,921
it looks far worse than it feels.

205
00:23:45,892 --> 00:23:48,725
Camelyarde! Camelyarde!

206
00:24:02,052 --> 00:24:04,725
God, send us a true king.

207
00:24:04,972 --> 00:24:06,325
We are unworthy...

208
00:24:06,492 --> 00:24:09,245
...but the land bleeds, the people suffer.

209
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:12,444
We have sinned, but on this Easter Day...

210
00:24:12,572 --> 00:24:15,484
...when Christ rose from the dead,
may one knight here...

211
00:24:15,572 --> 00:24:18,609
...through victory in arms find the grace...

212
00:24:18,772 --> 00:24:22,048
...to draw the sword and be king.

213
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:26,971
By my right of victory...

214
00:24:27,812 --> 00:24:29,165
...by my blood...

215
00:24:31,452 --> 00:24:32,965
...give me the power.

216
00:25:06,012 --> 00:25:09,163
All knights prepare and be ready...

217
00:25:09,692 --> 00:25:13,082
...who would joust for the right
to draw the sword...

218
00:25:13,372 --> 00:25:15,044
...from the stone.

219
00:25:18,092 --> 00:25:20,890
Arthur, where is Kay's sword?

220
00:25:27,452 --> 00:25:30,205
A good squire doesn't forget
his knight's sword.

221
00:25:31,132 --> 00:25:32,531
i left it in the tent, Father.

222
00:25:32,612 --> 00:25:34,443
Well hurry then, and get it.

223
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:46,361
Stolen!

224
00:26:11,012 --> 00:26:12,445
i'll see what's keeping him.

225
00:26:12,532 --> 00:26:14,807
Well hurry, you'll miss your chance.

226
00:26:42,532 --> 00:26:45,126
Your sword was stolen,
but here is Excalibur.

227
00:26:48,092 --> 00:26:49,047
Kay?

228
00:26:49,572 --> 00:26:52,245
Did you free Excalibur from the stone?

229
00:26:53,012 --> 00:26:54,001
Yes.

230
00:26:54,772 --> 00:26:57,491
No, i didn't. Arthur did.

231
00:26:57,612 --> 00:26:59,762
The sword! The sword!

232
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:01,731
You freed it, Arthur?

233
00:27:01,812 --> 00:27:04,087
i did, Father. i beg your forgiveness.

234
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:08,731
You must put it back.

235
00:27:20,652 --> 00:27:22,927
Now try to draw it again, Arthur.

236
00:27:24,372 --> 00:27:26,840
Wait! i, Uryens, will try.

237
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,211
Stand back.

238
00:27:37,532 --> 00:27:39,124
Let the boy try.

239
00:27:41,012 --> 00:27:42,809
Let the boy try.

240
00:27:46,972 --> 00:27:49,532
Come on, Arthur. Don't be afraid.

241
00:27:58,012 --> 00:28:01,448
We have our king! Thanks be to God!

242
00:28:08,732 --> 00:28:10,131
Rise, Father, please.

243
00:28:10,212 --> 00:28:12,726
i was your son before i became your king...

244
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:13,927
...if i am king.

245
00:28:14,012 --> 00:28:15,445
You are king...

246
00:28:16,212 --> 00:28:19,045
...the more so,
because you are not my son...

247
00:28:20,412 --> 00:28:22,289
...and i am not your father.

248
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,971
Not my father?

249
00:28:24,132 --> 00:28:25,850
Then Kay is not my brother?

250
00:28:26,852 --> 00:28:30,322
Merlin the magician brought you to me
when you were newly born...

251
00:28:30,892 --> 00:28:33,531
...and bade me raise you as my own.

252
00:28:34,452 --> 00:28:37,489
At first i did so because i feared Merlin,
but later...

253
00:28:38,292 --> 00:28:39,930
...because i loved you.

254
00:28:40,092 --> 00:28:41,650
Who is my true father?

255
00:28:42,052 --> 00:28:43,929
Only Merlin can tell you that.

256
00:28:44,092 --> 00:28:45,491
And who is Merlin?

257
00:28:45,772 --> 00:28:48,730
i am Merlin.

258
00:28:49,692 --> 00:28:51,125
Whose son am i?

259
00:28:52,172 --> 00:28:55,562
You are the son of Uther and igrayne...

260
00:28:56,892 --> 00:28:58,530
...you are King Arthur.

261
00:29:00,012 --> 00:29:02,685
We haven't forgotten you.
What trickery is this?

262
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:09,445
He's trying to foist
a fatherless boy upon us.

263
00:29:09,852 --> 00:29:12,047
Do you want a bastard as a king?

264
00:29:12,412 --> 00:29:14,642
Lord Leondegrance, join us against the boy.

265
00:29:14,732 --> 00:29:16,484
i saw what i saw.

266
00:29:17,252 --> 00:29:19,163
The boy drew the sword.

267
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:22,765
if a boy has been chosen...

268
00:29:23,332 --> 00:29:25,323
...a boy shall be king.

269
00:29:25,452 --> 00:29:27,443
No, i challenge that.

270
00:29:27,612 --> 00:29:29,443
The sword has been drawn.

271
00:29:30,412 --> 00:29:33,529
Are you with us or against us?

272
00:29:34,892 --> 00:29:36,405
Against you.

273
00:30:13,652 --> 00:30:15,051
Why have you done this to me?

274
00:30:15,132 --> 00:30:16,963
Because you were born to be king.

275
00:30:17,052 --> 00:30:18,246
What does it mean to be king?

276
00:30:18,332 --> 00:30:20,687
You will be the land,
and the land will be you.

277
00:30:20,772 --> 00:30:23,081
if you fail, the land will perish.

278
00:30:23,172 --> 00:30:25,322
As you thrive, the land will blossom.

279
00:30:25,412 --> 00:30:27,243
-Why?
-Because you are king.

280
00:30:27,412 --> 00:30:28,367
No!

281
00:31:55,892 --> 00:31:58,087
-What are you afraid of?
-i don't know.

282
00:31:58,172 --> 00:32:00,845
-Shall i tell you what's out there?
-Yes, please.

283
00:32:00,932 --> 00:32:02,001
The Dragon.

284
00:32:02,252 --> 00:32:04,004
A beast of such power...

285
00:32:04,252 --> 00:32:08,404
...that if you were to see it whole
and complete in a single glance...

286
00:32:08,492 --> 00:32:10,323
...it would burn you to cinders.

287
00:32:10,412 --> 00:32:12,562
-Where is it?
-it is everywhere.

288
00:32:12,892 --> 00:32:14,450
it is everything.

289
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:17,205
its scales glisten in the bark of trees.

290
00:32:17,332 --> 00:32:19,641
its roar is heard in the wind.

291
00:32:19,732 --> 00:32:22,007
And its forked tongue strikes like....

292
00:32:24,492 --> 00:32:26,483
Like lightning. Yes, that's it.

293
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,011
How can i...?

294
00:32:29,092 --> 00:32:30,810
What shall i...? Must i...?

295
00:32:30,892 --> 00:32:32,086
Do nothing.

296
00:32:32,732 --> 00:32:34,165
Be still. Sleep.

297
00:32:35,532 --> 00:32:37,887
Rest in the arms of the Dragon.

298
00:32:39,452 --> 00:32:40,931
Dream.

299
00:32:57,492 --> 00:32:59,926
Excalibur. it's part of the Dragon, too.

300
00:33:00,292 --> 00:33:01,441
Oh, yes.

301
00:33:02,332 --> 00:33:03,845
Oh, you learn quickly.

302
00:33:04,332 --> 00:33:05,401
That's good.

303
00:33:05,492 --> 00:33:06,641
i like that.

304
00:33:08,812 --> 00:33:10,768
What kind of man was my father?

305
00:33:11,452 --> 00:33:14,171
Oh, he was brave, he was strong.

306
00:33:14,372 --> 00:33:15,646
He was a great knight.

307
00:33:15,732 --> 00:33:17,211
Was he a great king?

308
00:33:17,892 --> 00:33:20,008
Well, he was rash.

309
00:33:20,092 --> 00:33:22,811
He never learned
how to look into men's hearts.

310
00:33:23,012 --> 00:33:24,491
Least of all his own.

311
00:33:24,572 --> 00:33:25,687
You loved him?

312
00:33:25,772 --> 00:33:28,969
Well, it is easy to love folly in a child.

313
00:33:30,772 --> 00:33:33,969
Merlin, will you help me to be wise,
not to be rash?

314
00:33:36,212 --> 00:33:37,440
Where are you going?

315
00:33:37,532 --> 00:33:40,490
Where do you think?
You have a kingdom to rule.

316
00:33:40,572 --> 00:33:42,961
But how? i don't know how.

317
00:33:43,292 --> 00:33:45,760
You knew how to draw the sword
from the stone.

318
00:33:45,852 --> 00:33:47,365
-That was easy.
-Was it?

319
00:33:47,452 --> 00:33:48,771
i couldn't have done it.

320
00:33:48,852 --> 00:33:49,762
You couldn't?

321
00:33:49,852 --> 00:33:51,365
You're the King, not i.

322
00:33:51,452 --> 00:33:52,601
But where to start?

323
00:33:52,692 --> 00:33:55,525
Well, what do you think has happened
since you ran off?

324
00:33:55,612 --> 00:33:58,968
Sir Ector and Kay.
They must be waiting all this time.

325
00:33:59,532 --> 00:34:03,491
Most of the great knights were against me.
Except Leondegrance of Camelyarde.

326
00:34:03,572 --> 00:34:06,245
But if he supports me,
the others will turn against him.

327
00:34:06,332 --> 00:34:08,641
Even now they lay siege to his castle.

328
00:34:08,812 --> 00:34:10,325
i need him. We must help him.

329
00:34:10,412 --> 00:34:11,481
There you are.

330
00:34:11,572 --> 00:34:13,369
That was easy, too, wasn't it?

331
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:15,044
We have to get back.

332
00:34:15,132 --> 00:34:16,281
That's it.

333
00:34:16,692 --> 00:34:17,681
Now....

334
00:34:18,332 --> 00:34:19,560
There they are.

335
00:34:23,732 --> 00:34:25,563
Well, you go and show them.

336
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:31,004
Arthur, i knew you wouldn't fail us.

337
00:34:31,092 --> 00:34:32,002
Go on.

338
00:34:32,412 --> 00:34:34,562
i picked out a horse for you.

339
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:38,328
All these men are loyal.
Now what do you want us to do?

340
00:34:38,412 --> 00:34:39,731
We waited here for you.

341
00:34:39,812 --> 00:34:42,167
Any man who would be a knight...

342
00:34:43,452 --> 00:34:45,682
...and follow a king, follow me.

343
00:34:45,772 --> 00:34:47,364
Where to? Where are we going?

344
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:49,841
Leondegrance, his castle is under siege.

345
00:34:49,972 --> 00:34:51,246
Guenevere, get back.

346
00:34:51,332 --> 00:34:53,368
You're beaten, Leondegrance.

347
00:35:22,972 --> 00:35:24,166
Get the hook.

348
00:35:31,052 --> 00:35:32,280
Throw the rope.

349
00:36:04,052 --> 00:36:05,201
That's good.

350
00:36:29,052 --> 00:36:30,041
That's it.

351
00:36:30,132 --> 00:36:32,726
Now round the other side.
Uryens is attacking.

352
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:43,811
Go on!

353
00:36:52,732 --> 00:36:53,687
Father!

354
00:36:54,972 --> 00:36:57,008
Hold on! Hold on!

355
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:13,128
Take the knights in the moat.
Hold them off.

356
00:37:13,852 --> 00:37:15,490
i'm going for the ladder.

357
00:37:37,852 --> 00:37:39,126
Father, look.

358
00:37:41,932 --> 00:37:43,331
it's the boy king.

359
00:38:29,332 --> 00:38:30,970
Behind you.

360
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:44,283
Swear faith to me
and you shall have mercy.

361
00:38:44,852 --> 00:38:46,843
i need battle lords such as you.

362
00:38:46,972 --> 00:38:50,521
A noble knight swear faith to a squire?

363
00:38:51,292 --> 00:38:53,169
Never, never!

364
00:39:00,132 --> 00:39:02,566
You are right. i'm not yet a knight.

365
00:39:04,732 --> 00:39:08,247
You, Uryens, will knight me.

366
00:39:09,692 --> 00:39:12,650
Then, as knight to knight,
i can offer you mercy.

367
00:39:15,932 --> 00:39:17,160
What's this?

368
00:39:17,852 --> 00:39:19,126
What's this?

369
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:30,002
Keep it, Uryens.

370
00:39:40,292 --> 00:39:43,284
in the name of God,
Saint Michael and Saint George...

371
00:39:43,652 --> 00:39:47,247
...i give you the right to bear arms
and the power to meet justice.

372
00:39:47,572 --> 00:39:49,722
That duty i will solemnly obey...

373
00:39:49,972 --> 00:39:51,769
...as knight and king.

374
00:39:52,412 --> 00:39:54,164
i never saw this.

375
00:39:54,932 --> 00:39:57,162
Rise, King Arthur.

376
00:39:59,852 --> 00:40:01,570
i am your humble knight...

377
00:40:02,252 --> 00:40:05,403
...and i swear allegiance
to the courage in your veins...

378
00:40:05,732 --> 00:40:07,450
...so strong it is...

379
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:10,764
...its source must be Uther Pendragon.

380
00:40:11,452 --> 00:40:13,363
i doubt you no more.

381
00:40:40,732 --> 00:40:42,962
-it didn't hurt too much, did it?
-No.

382
00:40:43,612 --> 00:40:46,126
i've sewn my father's wounds
more than once.

383
00:40:47,292 --> 00:40:49,522
Careful! You'll tear them open.

384
00:40:55,452 --> 00:40:57,204
You'll have to stay still and rest.

385
00:40:57,292 --> 00:40:58,361
How long?

386
00:40:59,892 --> 00:41:01,211
A few days.

387
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,209
Oh, no! What is it?

388
00:41:23,292 --> 00:41:24,611
The stitches.

389
00:41:25,292 --> 00:41:26,611
it's all right.

390
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:30,120
Come on, come on. Dance.

391
00:41:43,012 --> 00:41:44,923
A king must marry, after all.

392
00:41:45,092 --> 00:41:46,764
So it seems.

393
00:41:51,372 --> 00:41:53,966
i love her. if only she'd be my queen....

394
00:41:58,812 --> 00:42:01,042
Merlin, can you make her love me?

395
00:42:01,892 --> 00:42:02,927
Now, look.

396
00:42:03,012 --> 00:42:05,162
i once stood exposed
to the Dragon's breath...

397
00:42:05,252 --> 00:42:07,243
...so a man could lie one night
with a woman.

398
00:42:07,332 --> 00:42:09,687
it took me nine moons to recover...

399
00:42:09,772 --> 00:42:11,842
...and all for this lunacy called love...

400
00:42:11,932 --> 00:42:15,049
...this mad distemper,
that strikes down both beggar and king.

401
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:16,531
Never again!

402
00:42:17,492 --> 00:42:18,481
Never!

403
00:42:25,372 --> 00:42:28,330
Who will i marry then?
You can tell me that at least.

404
00:42:28,572 --> 00:42:29,846
What do you see?

405
00:42:36,172 --> 00:42:38,322
Oh, Guenevere.

406
00:42:40,972 --> 00:42:43,691
And a beloved friend who will betray you.

407
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:49,651
You're not listening. Your heart is not.
Love is deaf as well as blind.

408
00:42:54,652 --> 00:42:56,768
You have a land to quell before you can...

409
00:42:56,852 --> 00:42:59,605
...start all this hair pulling
and jumping about.

410
00:43:06,732 --> 00:43:08,609
i've made these only for you.

411
00:43:09,052 --> 00:43:12,362
i've mixed into them things
that will heal you, but not too quickly...

412
00:43:12,452 --> 00:43:15,762
...and they'll make you a little sleepy
so you can't escape.

413
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:17,087
What's in them?

414
00:43:17,172 --> 00:43:18,924
it is an ancient mixture...

415
00:43:19,132 --> 00:43:20,929
...soft, unborn grains...

416
00:43:21,292 --> 00:43:23,123
...flavored with rose petals.

417
00:43:24,412 --> 00:43:25,845
The rest is secret.

418
00:43:33,612 --> 00:43:36,331
Looking at the cake is like
looking at the future.

419
00:43:36,412 --> 00:43:39,165
Until you have tasted it,
what do you really know?

420
00:43:39,292 --> 00:43:41,852
And then, of course, it's too late.

421
00:43:45,092 --> 00:43:46,081
Too late.

422
00:44:02,052 --> 00:44:04,566
We have won battles against armies.

423
00:44:04,972 --> 00:44:07,645
And now one man defeats all my knights.

424
00:44:10,332 --> 00:44:12,846
He's a mighty opponent.

425
00:44:17,612 --> 00:44:18,806
A hard man.

426
00:44:19,412 --> 00:44:20,401
i'll go myself.

427
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:23,643
The King must not engage
in single combat. i'll go again.

428
00:44:23,732 --> 00:44:24,881
No, i will.

429
00:44:37,532 --> 00:44:39,648
Merlin, who is this knight?

430
00:44:41,212 --> 00:44:42,327
Look at him.

431
00:44:42,412 --> 00:44:43,606
So beautiful.

432
00:44:43,932 --> 00:44:44,967
So quick.

433
00:44:58,492 --> 00:44:59,607
Remember...

434
00:44:59,732 --> 00:45:02,610
...there's always something cleverer
than yourself.

435
00:45:13,572 --> 00:45:15,688
Move aside. This is the King's road...

436
00:45:15,772 --> 00:45:18,730
...and the knights you joined arms against
were his very own.

437
00:45:18,812 --> 00:45:20,404
i await the King himself.

438
00:45:20,492 --> 00:45:22,244
His knights are in need of training.

439
00:45:22,332 --> 00:45:24,607
i am King, and this...

440
00:45:26,212 --> 00:45:27,770
...is Excalibur...

441
00:45:28,012 --> 00:45:30,321
...sword of kings from the dawn of time.

442
00:45:30,412 --> 00:45:31,731
Who are you? What do you seek?

443
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:35,282
i am Lancelot of the Lake,
from across the sea.

444
00:45:35,612 --> 00:45:38,365
And i have yet to find a king
worthy of my sword.

445
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:41,689
That is a wild boast.
You lack a knight's humility.

446
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:44,647
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.

447
00:45:45,892 --> 00:45:48,565
For i have never met my match
in joust or duel.

448
00:45:49,852 --> 00:45:50,921
Move aside!

449
00:45:51,532 --> 00:45:52,647
i will not.

450
00:45:52,852 --> 00:45:54,285
You must retreat...

451
00:45:54,492 --> 00:45:58,007
...or prove your worth in the test of arms
under the eyes of God.

452
00:45:58,092 --> 00:46:00,560
Then may He give me the strength
to unhorse you...

453
00:46:00,652 --> 00:46:03,405
...and send you with one blow
back across the sea.

454
00:46:03,492 --> 00:46:05,050
Then come across, sir.

455
00:46:37,572 --> 00:46:40,211
You joust well, sir.
i offer you another lance.

456
00:46:40,452 --> 00:46:42,329
Yes. Yes. Another lance.

457
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:10,407
Sword!

458
00:47:17,052 --> 00:47:18,087
Yield, sir.

459
00:47:18,172 --> 00:47:20,242
-i have the advantage.
-i will not.

460
00:47:20,412 --> 00:47:24,644
Fight me, on your horse or on foot,
but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.

461
00:47:25,772 --> 00:47:28,081
i sought only not to harm you.

462
00:47:50,332 --> 00:47:52,323
Your rage has unbalanced you.

463
00:47:54,892 --> 00:47:58,851
You, sir, would fight to the death
against a knight who is not your enemy.

464
00:47:59,132 --> 00:48:02,010
For a stretch of road
you could easily ride around.

465
00:48:02,092 --> 00:48:04,526
So be it, to the death.

466
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:10,645
Excalibur...

467
00:49:11,932 --> 00:49:13,285
...i call...

468
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,130
...on your power.

469
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,684
Merlin, what have i done?

470
00:49:38,332 --> 00:49:39,765
You have broken...

471
00:49:40,892 --> 00:49:42,723
...what could not be broken.

472
00:49:45,532 --> 00:49:48,888
Hope is broken.

473
00:49:50,652 --> 00:49:52,404
My pride broke it.

474
00:49:52,892 --> 00:49:54,803
My rage broke it.

475
00:49:58,652 --> 00:50:00,449
This excellent knight...

476
00:50:00,532 --> 00:50:03,569
...who fought with fairness and grace
was meant to win.

477
00:50:04,412 --> 00:50:06,972
i used Excalibur to change that verdict.

478
00:50:08,012 --> 00:50:12,085
i have lost for all time
the ancient sword of my fathers...

479
00:50:12,252 --> 00:50:15,449
...whose power was meant
to unite all men...

480
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:18,770
...not to serve the vanity of a single man.

481
00:50:20,732 --> 00:50:22,927
i am nothing.

482
00:50:39,172 --> 00:50:40,685
The Lady of the Lake.

483
00:50:42,732 --> 00:50:44,006
Take it!

484
00:50:51,692 --> 00:50:52,727
Excalibur.

485
00:50:53,732 --> 00:50:54,801
is it true?

486
00:50:54,932 --> 00:50:56,524
Take it! Quickly!

487
00:51:49,332 --> 00:51:51,527
Thanks be to God, you're alive.

488
00:51:52,452 --> 00:51:55,649
i, the best knight in the world, bested!

489
00:51:56,452 --> 00:51:57,885
This is a great day.

490
00:51:58,772 --> 00:52:01,730
For my search is over, my king.

491
00:52:03,492 --> 00:52:04,811
Make me your champion.

492
00:52:04,892 --> 00:52:06,928
But your life and lands are far from here.

493
00:52:07,012 --> 00:52:08,968
i give up my castle and my lands.

494
00:52:09,052 --> 00:52:10,804
Here is my domain...

495
00:52:11,532 --> 00:52:13,363
...within this metal skin.

496
00:52:13,532 --> 00:52:15,807
And i pledge all that i still own:

497
00:52:16,252 --> 00:52:20,404
Muscle, bone, blood,
and the heart that pumps it.

498
00:52:20,812 --> 00:52:22,404
And a great heart it is.

499
00:52:22,692 --> 00:52:25,126
Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion.

500
00:52:52,412 --> 00:52:55,006
We killed every one of them!
Burnt their ships!

501
00:52:55,212 --> 00:52:57,009
Lancelot, how'd you fare in the North?

502
00:52:57,092 --> 00:53:00,164
We spared a few to tell what fate they met
at Arthur's hands.

503
00:53:00,252 --> 00:53:01,765
-And you, Uryens?
-Victory!

504
00:53:01,852 --> 00:53:02,887
Lot, and you?

505
00:53:02,972 --> 00:53:04,769
We drove the invaders back into the sea.

506
00:53:04,852 --> 00:53:05,762
Gawain, you?

507
00:53:05,852 --> 00:53:07,205
The East is ours again.

508
00:53:07,292 --> 00:53:09,362
The West is free and with us.

509
00:53:11,292 --> 00:53:13,123
The wars are over!

510
00:53:13,212 --> 00:53:15,282
One land, one king!

511
00:53:15,732 --> 00:53:16,767
Peace!

512
00:53:20,332 --> 00:53:21,890
Stand back!

513
00:53:23,172 --> 00:53:24,366
Be silent.

514
00:53:25,532 --> 00:53:26,567
Be still.

515
00:53:34,372 --> 00:53:35,407
That's it.

516
00:53:36,732 --> 00:53:38,450
And look upon this moment.

517
00:53:38,972 --> 00:53:40,166
Savor it.

518
00:53:40,732 --> 00:53:42,848
Rejoice with great gladness.

519
00:53:43,732 --> 00:53:44,926
Great gladness.

520
00:53:45,692 --> 00:53:47,444
Remember it, always...

521
00:53:48,132 --> 00:53:49,963
...for you are joined by it.

522
00:53:50,492 --> 00:53:53,404
You are one, under the stars.

523
00:53:56,292 --> 00:53:59,364
Remember it well then, this night...

524
00:54:00,292 --> 00:54:02,328
...this great victory...

525
00:54:03,252 --> 00:54:06,050
...so that in the years ahead you can say:

526
00:54:06,692 --> 00:54:09,923
"i was there that night,
with Arthur, the King."

527
00:54:15,412 --> 00:54:18,404
For it is the doom of men that they forget.

528
00:54:24,252 --> 00:54:26,607
Your wisdom has forged this ring.

529
00:54:28,212 --> 00:54:31,568
Hereafter,
so that we remember our bonds...

530
00:54:32,372 --> 00:54:34,727
...we shall always come together
in a circle...

531
00:54:34,812 --> 00:54:38,122
...to hear and tell of deeds good and brave.

532
00:54:40,332 --> 00:54:42,641
i will build a round table...

533
00:54:42,732 --> 00:54:44,882
...where this fellowship shall meet.

534
00:54:45,012 --> 00:54:46,968
And a hall about the table.

535
00:54:47,292 --> 00:54:49,601
And a castle about the hall.

536
00:54:50,492 --> 00:54:52,005
And i will marry.

537
00:54:55,052 --> 00:54:58,647
And the land will have an heir
to wield Excalibur.

538
00:55:02,492 --> 00:55:05,245
Knights of the Round Table.

539
00:55:17,652 --> 00:55:19,449
it's Sir Lancelot.

540
00:55:28,772 --> 00:55:30,683
Lancelot, welcome.

541
00:55:31,492 --> 00:55:32,971
This is a great day.

542
00:55:33,772 --> 00:55:36,570
Everything is prepared.
We'll leave at dawn.

543
00:55:38,932 --> 00:55:40,126
Guenevere...

544
00:55:41,932 --> 00:55:45,561
...here is Arthur's greatest knight
come to escort you to the King.

545
00:56:41,172 --> 00:56:43,003
They want me to ask you if...

546
00:56:43,172 --> 00:56:45,561
...any one of them could win your heart.

547
00:56:45,812 --> 00:56:47,291
i'm a fighting man.

548
00:56:47,572 --> 00:56:49,164
i'm sworn to the Quest.

549
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:54,571
But surely there must be some lady
somewhere in the world who inspires you?

550
00:56:55,012 --> 00:56:56,161
There is one.

551
00:56:57,892 --> 00:56:59,041
Who is she?

552
00:56:59,612 --> 00:57:01,011
Oh, go on, tell me.

553
00:57:02,332 --> 00:57:03,287
You.

554
00:57:04,772 --> 00:57:06,205
You're teasing me.

555
00:57:06,572 --> 00:57:08,210
i will love you always.

556
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:10,564
i will love you as my queen...

557
00:57:10,652 --> 00:57:12,961
...and as the wife of my best friend...

558
00:57:13,332 --> 00:57:14,970
...and while you live...

559
00:57:15,852 --> 00:57:17,808
...i will love no other.

560
00:57:52,892 --> 00:57:54,803
By the blood of Jesus Christ...

561
00:57:55,932 --> 00:57:57,604
...i join you in marriage.

562
00:58:00,612 --> 00:58:02,967
Man to woman.

563
00:58:04,972 --> 00:58:07,008
King to queen.

564
00:58:10,172 --> 00:58:12,732
Arthur to Guenevere.

565
00:58:31,212 --> 00:58:33,123
Don't you know me, Lord Merlin?

566
00:58:33,932 --> 00:58:35,729
Morgana of Cornwall.

567
00:58:37,692 --> 00:58:39,523
You have your father's eyes.

568
00:58:40,532 --> 00:58:41,726
i remember you.

569
00:58:42,332 --> 00:58:45,688
When my brother, Arthur, was born
you came and took him away.

570
00:58:46,732 --> 00:58:48,609
And now you leave his wedding.

571
00:58:49,612 --> 00:58:51,682
Because i am a creature like you.

572
00:58:54,492 --> 00:58:56,084
What is the stone that burns?

573
00:58:56,172 --> 00:58:58,322
Sulphur. To mix with mercury.

574
00:58:59,172 --> 00:59:00,605
What is that root?

575
00:59:07,372 --> 00:59:08,361
Mandrake.

576
00:59:11,012 --> 00:59:13,606
The essence of it
can prolong the act of love.

577
00:59:14,012 --> 00:59:15,684
And if too much is taken?

578
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:17,080
Pain and death.

579
00:59:17,492 --> 00:59:18,561
That's it.

580
00:59:19,292 --> 00:59:21,760
Oh, you do know something of the Art.

581
00:59:23,052 --> 00:59:24,451
Do you have the Sight?

582
00:59:24,532 --> 00:59:25,726
Do you see the future?

583
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:28,451
Sometimes, i dream of things
that come to pass.

584
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:29,767
Look now.

585
00:59:29,852 --> 00:59:31,001
What do you see?

586
00:59:31,092 --> 00:59:32,411
What will be?

587
00:59:33,612 --> 00:59:35,682
i see a castle of silver and gold.

588
00:59:35,932 --> 00:59:36,808
Up there.

589
00:59:36,892 --> 00:59:39,611
That plan is well-known.

590
00:59:39,932 --> 00:59:42,446
You'll have to do better than that.

591
00:59:52,892 --> 00:59:54,803
it is a lonely way, you know.

592
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:56,810
The way of the necromancer.

593
00:59:56,932 --> 00:59:59,526
Yes, to know too much...

594
01:00:00,092 --> 01:00:01,650
...lacrimae mundi...

595
01:00:01,892 --> 01:00:03,530
...the tears of the world.

596
01:00:03,612 --> 01:00:05,842
But the power? The joy?

597
01:00:05,932 --> 01:00:07,809
Moments. Fleeting moments.

598
01:00:08,292 --> 01:00:10,044
i can ease your loneliness.

599
01:00:10,332 --> 01:00:12,084
Let me help you. Teach me.

600
01:00:13,772 --> 01:00:16,161
The days of our kind are numbered.

601
01:00:17,812 --> 01:00:21,248
The one God comes to drive out
the many gods.

602
01:00:21,972 --> 01:00:24,247
The spirits of wood and stream...

603
01:00:24,732 --> 01:00:25,926
...grow silent.

604
01:00:27,052 --> 01:00:29,247
it's the way of things. Yes.

605
01:00:31,292 --> 01:00:34,011
it's a time for men and their ways.

606
01:01:33,892 --> 01:01:35,769
Run home to your mother, boy.

607
01:02:24,772 --> 01:02:26,410
Take me with you.

608
01:02:27,572 --> 01:02:29,085
i want to be a knight.

609
01:02:30,772 --> 01:02:32,410
i'll find food for you.

610
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:35,084
Did you like the rabbit?

611
01:02:36,892 --> 01:02:40,282
Do you know what it means
to serve a knight who serves a king?

612
01:02:41,172 --> 01:02:42,161
Jump up.

613
01:02:42,652 --> 01:02:43,767
i'll run.

614
01:02:45,212 --> 01:02:46,361
Listen boy...

615
01:02:46,492 --> 01:02:48,448
...it's more than 20 days from here.

616
01:02:48,532 --> 01:02:50,841
Twenty days! The world's not that big.

617
01:02:57,612 --> 01:02:58,840
What's that?

618
01:02:58,932 --> 01:03:00,888
Camelot, the King's castle.

619
01:03:09,692 --> 01:03:11,762
-Cavalry!
-Lancelot, welcome.

620
01:03:11,852 --> 01:03:13,126
Hey, Lot.

621
01:03:13,212 --> 01:03:16,090
Hey, Lancelot. Great to see you.

622
01:03:43,332 --> 01:03:45,129
Will you train this lad to be my squire?

623
01:03:45,212 --> 01:03:47,282
Who'll give me my armor and sword?

624
01:03:48,292 --> 01:03:51,443
Kitchen knives and greasy spits
shall be your weapons, boy.

625
01:03:51,532 --> 01:03:52,806
To the kitchens.

626
01:03:58,652 --> 01:03:59,687
Look!

627
01:04:03,892 --> 01:04:04,881
Staying?

628
01:04:05,452 --> 01:04:07,682
There's a meeting of the Round Table.

629
01:04:16,012 --> 01:04:17,286
No. i can't.

630
01:04:40,612 --> 01:04:41,567
Sorry, old fellow.

631
01:04:41,652 --> 01:04:44,212
What're you doing here?
This is no place for an old man.

632
01:04:44,292 --> 01:04:45,884
i built it, dullard.

633
01:04:46,092 --> 01:04:49,289
-All on your own?
-Yes, and for the likes of you, it seems.

634
01:04:49,372 --> 01:04:52,364
Oh, well, then you can tell me
the way to the kitchen.

635
01:04:53,372 --> 01:04:54,725
Follow your nose.

636
01:05:19,452 --> 01:05:20,726
i'm dreaming.

637
01:05:22,052 --> 01:05:23,531
i must be dreaming.

638
01:05:23,652 --> 01:05:25,290
Get away from there, boy.

639
01:05:56,852 --> 01:05:59,002
Lancelot doesn't come, once more.

640
01:05:59,292 --> 01:06:02,045
But we must fill his cup
to show our love for him.

641
01:06:03,772 --> 01:06:05,046
Watch Guenevere.

642
01:06:06,012 --> 01:06:08,162
Remember what i told you about them.

643
01:06:17,772 --> 01:06:19,842
Your eyes never leave me, Merlin.

644
01:06:20,932 --> 01:06:22,729
Can't i acknowledge beauty?

645
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,564
Can't you acknowledge love?

646
01:06:29,532 --> 01:06:32,126
Perhaps you ache
for what you've never known.

647
01:06:33,052 --> 01:06:35,885
Perhaps you lust for what you cannot have.

648
01:06:37,892 --> 01:06:40,042
Cannot have, but you promised.

649
01:06:40,732 --> 01:06:42,882
Your secrets.
You said you'd show me everything.

650
01:06:42,972 --> 01:06:44,963
i've shown you too much already.

651
01:06:47,492 --> 01:06:49,687
Are you counselor to the King,
or to my sister?

652
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:51,330
At your service, sir.

653
01:06:52,052 --> 01:06:53,531
Then answer me this.

654
01:06:54,172 --> 01:06:56,561
For years peace has reigned in the land.

655
01:06:57,492 --> 01:07:00,006
Crops grow in abundance, there's no want.

656
01:07:01,292 --> 01:07:05,046
Every one of my subjects enjoys
his portion of happiness and justice.

657
01:07:05,372 --> 01:07:07,681
Tell me, Merlin, have we defeated evil?

658
01:07:07,932 --> 01:07:08,967
it seems we have.

659
01:07:09,052 --> 01:07:12,408
Good and evil,
there never is one without the other.

660
01:07:15,212 --> 01:07:17,487
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?

661
01:07:19,292 --> 01:07:20,361
Always...

662
01:07:22,932 --> 01:07:24,809
...where you never expect it.

663
01:07:26,252 --> 01:07:27,162
Always.

664
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:32,321
i know where.

665
01:07:33,052 --> 01:07:34,451
Where, Sir Gawain?

666
01:07:38,132 --> 01:07:39,406
i cannot say.

667
01:07:41,372 --> 01:07:44,011
You must speak your heart.
You sit at the Round Table.

668
01:07:44,092 --> 01:07:45,525
Where is this evil?

669
01:07:48,572 --> 01:07:50,642
He's our best and bravest.

670
01:07:52,412 --> 01:07:54,130
Why then is he never here?

671
01:07:54,332 --> 01:07:56,926
Without Lancelot this Table is nothing.

672
01:07:58,332 --> 01:08:01,085
is there anyone here
who doesn't think him a god?

673
01:08:02,772 --> 01:08:05,491
And now to be driven from us
by a woman's desire.

674
01:08:06,732 --> 01:08:10,964
in the idleness that comes with peace,
i see that gossip has bred its own evil.

675
01:08:17,212 --> 01:08:18,770
i will forgive your...

676
01:08:19,372 --> 01:08:20,725
...hasty words.

677
01:08:23,412 --> 01:08:24,447
Come.

678
01:08:25,972 --> 01:08:29,203
Drink from Lancelot's cup
and partake of his goodness.

679
01:09:12,092 --> 01:09:14,128
You dare accuse the Queen, Gawain?

680
01:09:15,932 --> 01:09:16,808
i do!

681
01:09:18,292 --> 01:09:19,691
i protest my innocence.

682
01:09:19,772 --> 01:09:23,765
Were i not king, i would make you pay
with your life for what you've said.

683
01:09:25,372 --> 01:09:27,522
-Will you not champion me?
-i cannot.

684
01:09:28,132 --> 01:09:30,851
i'm your king,
and i must be your judge in this.

685
01:09:31,212 --> 01:09:32,691
Lancelot must do it.

686
01:09:33,372 --> 01:09:34,964
He also stands accused.

687
01:09:35,452 --> 01:09:36,680
i decree...

688
01:09:37,132 --> 01:09:39,521
...that at sunrise two days from now...

689
01:09:39,972 --> 01:09:43,248
...the champions will meet,
and the truth shall be known.

690
01:09:45,252 --> 01:09:47,129
For by the law of God...

691
01:09:47,332 --> 01:09:49,971
...no knight who is false
can win in combat...

692
01:09:50,652 --> 01:09:52,244
...with one who is true.

693
01:10:07,532 --> 01:10:09,602
You are the people i love best in the world.

694
01:10:09,692 --> 01:10:12,286
-Then why can't you defend me?
-The law!

695
01:10:17,772 --> 01:10:22,482
My laws must bind everyone,
high and low, or they're not laws at all.

696
01:10:22,572 --> 01:10:25,040
-You are my husband.
-i must be king first.

697
01:10:25,692 --> 01:10:26,647
Before husband?

698
01:10:26,732 --> 01:10:27,847
if need be.

699
01:10:32,252 --> 01:10:33,401
Before love?

700
01:10:38,492 --> 01:10:40,722
Lord, we are innocent...

701
01:10:41,492 --> 01:10:43,130
...but not in our hearts.

702
01:10:44,132 --> 01:10:46,885
To hold her once in my arms,
i would sacrifice everything:

703
01:10:46,972 --> 01:10:47,882
Honor.

704
01:10:47,972 --> 01:10:50,440
Truth. My sacred trust. God...

705
01:10:51,012 --> 01:10:54,561
...save me from myself,
purge me of this love...

706
01:10:55,772 --> 01:10:57,683
...so that i can defend her.

707
01:11:44,932 --> 01:11:46,650
i fight against myself.

708
01:11:46,852 --> 01:11:48,046
Oh, God!

709
01:12:10,652 --> 01:12:12,722
My lord, the sun is upon the field.

710
01:12:13,772 --> 01:12:15,490
The queen has no champion.

711
01:12:17,212 --> 01:12:19,043
i demand justice, as is my right.

712
01:12:19,132 --> 01:12:20,167
So it is.

713
01:12:34,212 --> 01:12:35,884
Let me champion the Queen!

714
01:12:39,492 --> 01:12:42,450
Since no knight comes forward,
i demand justice.

715
01:12:57,452 --> 01:12:59,283
is there not one of you?

716
01:12:59,412 --> 01:13:00,640
Let me through.

717
01:13:04,372 --> 01:13:05,487
Boy, kneel.

718
01:13:07,452 --> 01:13:08,931
in the name of God...

719
01:13:09,012 --> 01:13:10,240
...of Saint Michael...

720
01:13:10,332 --> 01:13:11,890
...and Saint George...

721
01:13:12,052 --> 01:13:13,644
...i make you a knight.

722
01:13:13,732 --> 01:13:15,051
Rise, Sir...

723
01:13:15,652 --> 01:13:17,290
-Perceval.
-...Perceval.

724
01:13:58,652 --> 01:13:59,721
Lancelot!

725
01:14:29,092 --> 01:14:32,084
it's my task, Perceval,
to prove the queen's innocence.

726
01:16:35,292 --> 01:16:37,283
i yield to your mercy, Lancelot.

727
01:16:41,572 --> 01:16:43,085
The Queen is innocent!

728
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:05,765
Look at your laws now.

729
01:17:06,332 --> 01:17:07,890
Look what they have done.

730
01:17:07,972 --> 01:17:10,645
-Save him, Merlin.
-He has no will to live.

731
01:17:10,812 --> 01:17:12,882
Bring him back, whatever the cost.

732
01:17:13,052 --> 01:17:14,770
Whatever the cost! Do it!

733
01:17:16,652 --> 01:17:17,801
So be it.

734
01:17:40,852 --> 01:17:42,763
-Will he live?
-Oh, yes.

735
01:17:44,132 --> 01:17:45,770
-Will Guenevere...?
-Yes.

736
01:17:47,692 --> 01:17:49,922
-Merlin, will i ever have a son?
-Yes.

737
01:17:51,452 --> 01:17:54,489
No riddles, nothing but a simple yes?
That frightens me.

738
01:17:55,532 --> 01:17:59,161
But a king should be afraid,
Arthur, always...

739
01:18:00,492 --> 01:18:03,564
...of the enemy waiting everywhere...

740
01:18:03,972 --> 01:18:06,042
...in the corridors of his castle...

741
01:18:06,132 --> 01:18:08,362
...on the deer paths of his forest...

742
01:18:08,652 --> 01:18:10,722
...or in a more tangled forest...

743
01:18:11,852 --> 01:18:12,921
...in here.

744
01:18:45,132 --> 01:18:46,929
Welcome, welcome back.

745
01:18:48,012 --> 01:18:49,968
Take your place again, Lancelot.

746
01:18:50,132 --> 01:18:51,201
My lord.

747
01:18:52,092 --> 01:18:54,652
Look! Sir Lancelot! He's back!

748
01:18:57,732 --> 01:18:59,085
No more going.

749
01:19:01,212 --> 01:19:03,772
They miss the battlefield.
i think we do, too.

750
01:19:05,372 --> 01:19:07,203
We have lost our way, Arthur.

751
01:19:08,492 --> 01:19:12,121
it is not easy for them without
the hard teaching of war and quest.

752
01:19:13,412 --> 01:19:16,404
it is only your example, Lancelot,
that binds them all.

753
01:19:19,852 --> 01:19:22,366
Which is the greatest quality
of knighthood?

754
01:19:22,492 --> 01:19:24,483
Courage? Compassion? Loyalty?

755
01:19:24,972 --> 01:19:26,121
Humility?

756
01:19:27,332 --> 01:19:28,970
What do you say, Merlin?

757
01:19:36,652 --> 01:19:37,846
The greatest?

758
01:19:39,332 --> 01:19:42,961
Well, they blend like the metals we mix
to make a good sword.

759
01:19:43,372 --> 01:19:46,045
No poetry. Just a straight answer.
Which is it?

760
01:19:46,292 --> 01:19:47,611
All right, then.

761
01:19:47,772 --> 01:19:49,205
Truth. That's it.

762
01:19:49,772 --> 01:19:52,570
Yes. it must be truth, above all.

763
01:19:53,652 --> 01:19:56,724
When a man lies,
he murders some part of the world.

764
01:19:57,892 --> 01:19:59,405
You should know that.

765
01:20:04,692 --> 01:20:06,762
i must take my rest in the forest.

766
01:20:08,212 --> 01:20:10,203
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?

767
01:20:12,332 --> 01:20:13,447
it is deep.

768
01:20:14,492 --> 01:20:16,960
You'll be sorely missed. Heal yourself...

769
01:20:17,772 --> 01:20:19,125
...and come back.

770
01:21:19,332 --> 01:21:21,129
Do you still have the Sight, Merlin?

771
01:21:21,212 --> 01:21:22,804
Are they together?

772
01:21:24,172 --> 01:21:25,127
Yes.

773
01:21:28,572 --> 01:21:31,132
You warned me of this, all those years ago.

774
01:21:32,332 --> 01:21:34,243
What must i do now, kill them?

775
01:21:37,772 --> 01:21:39,603
i can tell you nothing more.

776
01:21:39,972 --> 01:21:41,325
My days are ended.

777
01:21:42,132 --> 01:21:44,362
The gods of once are gone forever.

778
01:21:45,532 --> 01:21:47,011
it's a time for men.

779
01:21:47,212 --> 01:21:48,884
it's your time, Arthur.

780
01:21:49,372 --> 01:21:51,647
i need you now, more than ever.

781
01:21:51,812 --> 01:21:52,881
No.

782
01:21:53,532 --> 01:21:56,000
This is the moment
that you must face at last...

783
01:21:56,092 --> 01:21:57,525
...to be king alone.

784
01:21:58,452 --> 01:22:00,170
And you, old friend?

785
01:22:03,292 --> 01:22:04,725
Will i see you again?

786
01:22:04,812 --> 01:22:05,801
No.

787
01:22:07,932 --> 01:22:09,570
There are other worlds.

788
01:22:10,092 --> 01:22:11,764
This one is done with me.

789
01:22:24,892 --> 01:22:26,007
That's it.

790
01:23:00,271 --> 01:23:02,580
Bat wing. Snake skin.

791
01:23:03,671 --> 01:23:05,787
is this all you've learned, Morgana?

792
01:23:06,111 --> 01:23:09,023
To deal in potions and petty evil.

793
01:23:10,551 --> 01:23:13,224
And where have your meddling arts
brought the world?

794
01:23:13,311 --> 01:23:14,790
To the edge of ruin.

795
01:23:16,471 --> 01:23:19,144
i'm worn thin and threadbare.

796
01:23:20,351 --> 01:23:23,707
i've tried to guide men,
or meddled in their affairs...

797
01:23:23,791 --> 01:23:26,305
...as you would have it, for far too long.

798
01:23:26,951 --> 01:23:29,306
The time has come for me to go.

799
01:23:33,791 --> 01:23:35,827
Forgive me. Where are you going?

800
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:37,739
Whence i came.

801
01:23:37,911 --> 01:23:39,902
Merlin, take me with you.

802
01:23:40,031 --> 01:23:42,750
The Charm of Making,
you swore to pass it to me.

803
01:23:42,911 --> 01:23:44,549
You think you're ready?

804
01:23:45,631 --> 01:23:46,950
Are you worthy?

805
01:23:48,311 --> 01:23:49,346
i am.

806
01:23:50,631 --> 01:23:51,666
i am.

807
01:23:52,591 --> 01:23:54,343
Then follow me.

808
01:24:34,991 --> 01:24:36,390
What is this place?

809
01:24:36,471 --> 01:24:39,144
Here, you enter the coils of the Dragon.

810
01:24:39,271 --> 01:24:41,068
Here, my power was born.

811
01:24:41,871 --> 01:24:43,907
Here, all things are possible...

812
01:24:43,991 --> 01:24:46,505
...and all things meet their opposites.

813
01:24:47,671 --> 01:24:48,945
The future?

814
01:24:49,471 --> 01:24:50,824
And the past.

815
01:24:51,511 --> 01:24:52,626
Desire?

816
01:24:52,991 --> 01:24:54,344
And regret.

817
01:24:55,151 --> 01:24:56,470
Knowledge?

818
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:57,740
And oblivion.

819
01:24:59,391 --> 01:25:00,460
Love?

820
01:25:01,711 --> 01:25:02,905
Oh, yes.

821
01:25:03,911 --> 01:25:04,866
Look.

822
01:25:28,231 --> 01:25:29,266
More.

823
01:25:29,751 --> 01:25:30,979
Show me more.

824
01:25:32,471 --> 01:25:33,745
Show me the Dragon.

825
01:25:33,831 --> 01:25:35,947
Tell me the sacred Charm of Making.

826
01:25:36,991 --> 01:25:39,380
Even though such knowledge would burn...

827
01:25:39,551 --> 01:25:40,870
...and blind you?

828
01:25:41,751 --> 01:25:42,945
Then burn me.

829
01:26:19,751 --> 01:26:23,300
Look into the eyes of the Dragon,
and despair.

830
01:26:23,391 --> 01:26:26,542
i destroy you. i consign you to oblivion.

831
01:26:45,911 --> 01:26:47,185
Arthur....

832
01:26:48,591 --> 01:26:51,981
Excalibur, into the spine of the Dragon!

833
01:26:54,391 --> 01:26:55,870
The sword! The land!

834
01:26:55,951 --> 01:26:58,670
Yes, Merlin. That's it.
Set the world to rights.

835
01:26:58,791 --> 01:27:00,110
Call the Dragon.

836
01:27:01,391 --> 01:27:02,585
Mend the sword.

837
01:27:03,191 --> 01:27:05,421
Speak the Charm of Making.

838
01:27:49,911 --> 01:27:51,310
You fool!

839
01:27:51,991 --> 01:27:53,902
You thought you would trap me.

840
01:27:54,111 --> 01:27:58,184
You are trapped yourself, by the same
sorcery you used to deceive my mother.

841
01:27:59,511 --> 01:28:00,739
You're nothing.

842
01:28:01,231 --> 01:28:03,347
You're not a god, you're not a man.

843
01:28:03,671 --> 01:28:07,186
i shall find a man and give birth to a god.

844
01:28:39,111 --> 01:28:40,783
The King without a sword!

845
01:28:42,471 --> 01:28:44,109
The land without a king!

846
01:29:14,711 --> 01:29:16,030
Love me.

847
01:29:16,991 --> 01:29:18,310
Love me.

848
01:29:20,311 --> 01:29:23,109
-Guenevere....
-Forget and love me.

849
01:29:27,791 --> 01:29:30,624
i have conceived a son, my king...

850
01:29:32,671 --> 01:29:34,150
...my brother.

851
01:29:36,351 --> 01:29:38,262
i could kill you now, brother.

852
01:29:39,671 --> 01:29:42,868
But i want you to live
to see our son be king.

853
01:30:29,751 --> 01:30:32,311
God save us from Morgana.

854
01:30:33,351 --> 01:30:36,627
And save us from her unholy child.

855
01:30:52,271 --> 01:30:53,420
is he dead?

856
01:30:54,751 --> 01:30:56,343
No, he lives.

857
01:31:00,191 --> 01:31:01,419
A knight....

858
01:31:02,871 --> 01:31:04,020
Help us.

859
01:31:05,431 --> 01:31:07,103
Help us, please.

860
01:31:07,191 --> 01:31:09,659
We're dying. Our children are dying.

861
01:31:10,711 --> 01:31:12,190
Where is the King?

862
01:31:13,511 --> 01:31:15,024
Please, help us!

863
01:31:34,991 --> 01:31:36,902
We must find what was lost.

864
01:31:38,191 --> 01:31:39,385
The Grail....

865
01:31:40,591 --> 01:31:44,550
Only the Grail can restore leaf and flower.

866
01:31:45,711 --> 01:31:47,190
Search the land...

867
01:31:48,231 --> 01:31:50,381
...the labyrinths of the forests...

868
01:31:51,591 --> 01:31:53,070
...to the edge of...

869
01:31:54,231 --> 01:31:55,380
...within.

870
01:31:56,951 --> 01:31:58,828
Only the Grail can redeem us.

871
01:32:00,071 --> 01:32:01,265
Search.

872
01:32:02,751 --> 01:32:03,661
Seek.

873
01:32:04,551 --> 01:32:06,143
Where do we look for it?

874
01:32:09,111 --> 01:32:10,430
Portents...

875
01:32:12,231 --> 01:32:13,550
...signs...

876
01:32:15,551 --> 01:32:16,779
...follow.

877
01:32:23,351 --> 01:32:24,989
The King has spoken.

878
01:32:26,231 --> 01:32:28,745
i will ride forth in the name of that quest.

879
01:32:28,871 --> 01:32:30,862
We will find this grail or die.

880
01:33:51,391 --> 01:33:53,268
Have you found it? The Grail.

881
01:33:53,471 --> 01:33:54,950
it's me, Perceval.

882
01:34:06,551 --> 01:34:08,143
We will never find it.

883
01:34:51,791 --> 01:34:52,826
Gawain!

884
01:35:32,271 --> 01:35:33,989
You seek what Arthur wants?

885
01:35:34,951 --> 01:35:37,260
-That thing they call the Grail?
-i do.

886
01:35:37,351 --> 01:35:38,864
Then follow me.

887
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:13,741
They were looking for it, too,
but they weren't good enough.

888
01:36:48,471 --> 01:36:51,508
Mordred, my lovely, clever boy.

889
01:36:56,871 --> 01:36:59,066
You have crossed the great wasteland.

890
01:37:00,111 --> 01:37:01,942
You are burning with thirst.

891
01:37:04,151 --> 01:37:05,106
Drink.

892
01:37:09,231 --> 01:37:11,665
For ten years and a day you have searched.

893
01:37:12,191 --> 01:37:13,590
is it so long?

894
01:37:13,671 --> 01:37:14,865
And tell me...

895
01:37:16,351 --> 01:37:18,342
...have you found what you seek?

896
01:37:18,551 --> 01:37:22,021
i have found nothing but sorrow and death.

897
01:37:25,511 --> 01:37:27,945
i never thought to hear laughter again...

898
01:37:29,191 --> 01:37:30,829
...till i saw this boy.

899
01:37:31,911 --> 01:37:33,549
He promised me the Grail.

900
01:37:35,831 --> 01:37:36,946
is it here?

901
01:37:37,031 --> 01:37:38,908
You have searched too hard.

902
01:37:40,791 --> 01:37:42,224
Take your ease.

903
01:37:46,511 --> 01:37:48,820
Drink, and join with me.

904
01:38:02,031 --> 01:38:04,101
Bors! You're here!

905
01:38:06,551 --> 01:38:08,348
Meliot! You, too.

906
01:38:09,471 --> 01:38:10,699
You are alive.

907
01:38:11,471 --> 01:38:14,383
There is no grail,
as these good knights have found.

908
01:38:14,671 --> 01:38:16,309
They serve me instead.

909
01:38:16,951 --> 01:38:20,660
There are many pleasures in the world,
many cups to drink from...

910
01:38:20,831 --> 01:38:23,186
...and they shall be yours. Drink.

911
01:38:24,871 --> 01:38:26,065
No!

912
01:38:27,791 --> 01:38:29,304
He's no good, Mother.

913
01:38:35,151 --> 01:38:36,630
Take him to the tree.

914
01:38:43,671 --> 01:38:44,626
No!

915
01:38:45,911 --> 01:38:47,424
There is a grail!

916
01:40:00,311 --> 01:40:05,021
What is the secret of the Grail?

917
01:40:06,591 --> 01:40:09,105
Who does it serve?

918
01:40:42,551 --> 01:40:45,384
Arthur, the secret was in my grasp.

919
01:40:46,191 --> 01:40:47,340
i failed you.

920
01:40:59,431 --> 01:41:01,501
When am i going to be king, Mother?

921
01:41:02,471 --> 01:41:05,588
When the time comes,
i will send you to your father.

922
01:41:07,591 --> 01:41:11,345
You will take what is yours
and then you will be king.

923
01:41:17,231 --> 01:41:19,540
No spear. No sword.

924
01:41:19,951 --> 01:41:21,179
No arrow.

925
01:41:21,311 --> 01:41:23,427
No lance. No blade.

926
01:41:24,631 --> 01:41:27,304
No weapon forged by man...

927
01:41:27,991 --> 01:41:30,505
...will harm you
whilst you wear this armor.

928
01:41:31,031 --> 01:41:33,989
Any message for your dear brother,
my father?

929
01:41:35,191 --> 01:41:36,783
You are my message.

930
01:42:09,111 --> 01:42:10,783
Keep a distance, Mordred.

931
01:42:15,511 --> 01:42:17,979
i have come to claim what is mine, Father.

932
01:42:18,671 --> 01:42:19,820
Show yourself.

933
01:42:32,311 --> 01:42:34,461
i cannot give you the land...

934
01:42:38,271 --> 01:42:39,590
...only my love.

935
01:42:40,911 --> 01:42:43,505
That's the only thing of yours i don't want.

936
01:42:44,791 --> 01:42:46,702
The Quest Knights have failed.

937
01:42:47,191 --> 01:42:48,544
They're all dead.

938
01:42:49,751 --> 01:42:51,662
You are dead, too.

939
01:42:53,751 --> 01:42:56,504
i shall come back
and take Camelot by force.

940
01:43:25,671 --> 01:43:26,706
Uryens!

941
01:43:35,311 --> 01:43:37,267
Renounce the King and i'll spare your life.

942
01:43:37,351 --> 01:43:38,579
Never!

943
01:43:41,111 --> 01:43:42,146
So be it.

944
01:44:54,231 --> 01:44:55,300
Uryens....

945
01:44:59,991 --> 01:45:01,583
i was afraid to help you.

946
01:45:01,671 --> 01:45:04,310
Perceval, never give up the Quest.

947
01:45:06,431 --> 01:45:08,023
i saw the Grail, Uryens.

948
01:45:09,271 --> 01:45:10,704
it was in my grasp.

949
01:45:12,151 --> 01:45:13,140
i failed.

950
01:45:15,271 --> 01:45:18,343
You are the last of us. Try again.

951
01:45:18,911 --> 01:45:20,344
i am not worthy.

952
01:45:21,071 --> 01:45:22,663
You must...you--

953
01:45:27,671 --> 01:45:28,786
Listen!

954
01:45:31,111 --> 01:45:32,146
Follow.

955
01:45:36,591 --> 01:45:37,785
They call you.

956
01:46:12,711 --> 01:46:14,269
All around is death!

957
01:46:14,391 --> 01:46:15,904
Death everywhere!

958
01:46:16,071 --> 01:46:17,902
All of you will come to death...

959
01:46:17,991 --> 01:46:21,063
...for it is our constant companion
through life as we trudge...

960
01:46:21,151 --> 01:46:22,743
...through this weary...

961
01:46:22,871 --> 01:46:26,546
...and tragic scene
of the valley of the shadow of death.

962
01:46:28,711 --> 01:46:31,350
Look at the great knight!

963
01:46:33,031 --> 01:46:35,420
Peace and plenty they promised.

964
01:46:36,311 --> 01:46:38,347
But what did they give us instead?

965
01:46:38,751 --> 01:46:40,981
Famine and pestilence.

966
01:46:41,791 --> 01:46:43,747
-Lancelot, is it you?
-And death.

967
01:46:44,071 --> 01:46:46,904
Because of their pride,
and because of their sin...

968
01:46:46,991 --> 01:46:49,630
-it's me, Perceval.
-...God has left the world.

969
01:46:58,271 --> 01:47:00,307
They made themselves God...

970
01:47:00,911 --> 01:47:02,902
...and Christ has abandoned us.

971
01:47:10,511 --> 01:47:13,503
Lancelot, won't you help us?
Come back to us, Lancelot!

972
01:47:15,551 --> 01:47:16,870
Arthur needs you!

973
01:47:17,791 --> 01:47:18,667
Lancelot!

974
01:48:07,671 --> 01:48:09,582
i can't give up hope, Lancelot.

975
01:48:11,871 --> 01:48:13,190
it's all i have.

976
01:48:46,071 --> 01:48:50,508
What is the secret of the Grail?

977
01:48:52,191 --> 01:48:54,785
Who does it serve?

978
01:48:55,911 --> 01:48:57,264
You, my lord.

979
01:49:01,751 --> 01:49:04,106
Who am I?

980
01:49:05,551 --> 01:49:07,189
You are my lord and king.

981
01:49:08,471 --> 01:49:09,699
You are Arthur.

982
01:49:11,391 --> 01:49:14,224
Have you found the secret...

983
01:49:14,791 --> 01:49:16,622
...that I have lost?

984
01:49:17,151 --> 01:49:18,186
Yes.

985
01:49:19,151 --> 01:49:20,789
You and the land are one.

986
01:49:43,991 --> 01:49:46,061
You and the land are one. Drink.

987
01:49:46,391 --> 01:49:47,824
i am wasting away.

988
01:49:48,431 --> 01:49:51,343
i cannot die and i cannot live.

989
01:49:51,511 --> 01:49:55,026
Drink from the chalice.
You will be reborn and the land with you.

990
01:50:07,471 --> 01:50:08,586
Perceval...

991
01:50:11,431 --> 01:50:13,865
...i didn't know how empty was my soul...

992
01:50:14,791 --> 01:50:16,429
...until it was filled.

993
01:50:25,671 --> 01:50:26,706
Arthur!

994
01:50:27,151 --> 01:50:30,700
Ready my knights for battle.
They will ride with their king once more.

995
01:50:30,791 --> 01:50:33,225
i have lived through others far too long.

996
01:50:33,511 --> 01:50:36,548
Lancelot carried my honor
and Guenevere my guilt.

997
01:50:36,991 --> 01:50:38,549
Mordred bore my sins.

998
01:50:38,911 --> 01:50:41,300
My knights have fought my causes.

999
01:50:41,991 --> 01:50:43,663
Now, my brother...

1000
01:50:44,231 --> 01:50:46,267
...i shall be king.

1001
01:50:51,711 --> 01:50:52,746
Guards!

1002
01:50:53,991 --> 01:50:55,026
Knights!

1003
01:50:56,191 --> 01:50:57,340
Squires!

1004
01:50:58,391 --> 01:50:59,870
Prepare for battle!

1005
01:52:36,631 --> 01:52:37,746
Guenevere...

1006
01:52:43,511 --> 01:52:45,263
...accept my forgiveness...

1007
01:52:45,671 --> 01:52:47,582
...and put your heart to rest.

1008
01:52:47,951 --> 01:52:49,543
We've suffered too long.

1009
01:52:50,191 --> 01:52:52,751
i have always loved you, and still love you.

1010
01:52:53,671 --> 01:52:55,184
i loved you as king...

1011
01:52:56,071 --> 01:52:57,743
...sometimes as husband...

1012
01:52:59,911 --> 01:53:02,425
...but one cannot gaze too long at the sun.

1013
01:53:04,191 --> 01:53:06,546
Forgive me, my wife, if you can.

1014
01:53:13,071 --> 01:53:15,346
i was not born to live a man's life...

1015
01:53:15,631 --> 01:53:18,589
...but to be the stuff of future memory.

1016
01:53:20,271 --> 01:53:22,785
The fellowship was a brief beginning...

1017
01:53:23,511 --> 01:53:25,900
...a fair time that cannot be forgotten.

1018
01:53:27,791 --> 01:53:30,180
And because it will not be forgotten...

1019
01:53:31,591 --> 01:53:33,821
...that fair time may come again.

1020
01:53:36,471 --> 01:53:38,985
Now once more i must ride
with my knights...

1021
01:53:39,551 --> 01:53:41,189
...to defend what was...

1022
01:53:41,871 --> 01:53:43,941
...and the dream of what could be.

1023
01:53:58,631 --> 01:53:59,746
i kept it.

1024
01:54:10,591 --> 01:54:14,220
i never dared to hope, all these years,
that it was in your keeping.

1025
01:54:18,191 --> 01:54:19,829
i have often thought...

1026
01:54:20,231 --> 01:54:22,950
...that in the hereafter of our lives...

1027
01:54:24,911 --> 01:54:27,027
...when i owe no more to the future...

1028
01:54:27,111 --> 01:54:29,067
...and can be just a man...

1029
01:54:30,551 --> 01:54:33,463
...that we may meet
and you will come to me...

1030
01:54:35,191 --> 01:54:36,783
...and claim me yours...

1031
01:54:37,671 --> 01:54:39,787
...and know that i am your husband.

1032
01:54:47,711 --> 01:54:49,667
it is a dream i have.

1033
01:55:17,391 --> 01:55:18,983
it is only me and my son.

1034
01:55:19,071 --> 01:55:21,744
All other knights of the dukedom
have rallied to Mordred.

1035
01:55:21,831 --> 01:55:23,469
What's that smoke yonder?

1036
01:55:24,471 --> 01:55:26,382
That is Mordred's army.

1037
01:55:26,551 --> 01:55:29,429
Then let us camp here tonight,
and fight tomorrow.

1038
01:55:46,271 --> 01:55:47,340
Merlin...

1039
01:55:49,511 --> 01:55:53,060
...if only you were at my side,
my old friend, to give me courage.

1040
01:55:55,151 --> 01:55:58,985
There are no war tricks
that will fool Mordred and Morgana.

1041
01:56:05,871 --> 01:56:08,101
More than i ever did, i need you now.

1042
01:56:15,031 --> 01:56:16,589
Where are you, Merlin?

1043
01:56:18,991 --> 01:56:20,868
if only you could see me...

1044
01:56:21,591 --> 01:56:24,105
...wield Excalibur once more.

1045
01:56:39,191 --> 01:56:40,260
Arthur....

1046
01:56:45,431 --> 01:56:47,626
Where have you been these many years?

1047
01:56:48,471 --> 01:56:51,304
-is it true that Morgana--
-Stories.

1048
01:56:52,151 --> 01:56:55,985
You brought me back.
Your love brought me back.

1049
01:56:56,631 --> 01:56:58,462
Back to where you are now...

1050
01:56:59,511 --> 01:57:01,388
...in the land of dreams.

1051
01:57:02,711 --> 01:57:04,224
Are you just a dream?

1052
01:57:06,551 --> 01:57:08,826
A dream to some...

1053
01:57:10,071 --> 01:57:11,982
...a nightmare to others.

1054
01:57:28,151 --> 01:57:29,903
Kay, wake up, my brother.

1055
01:57:30,991 --> 01:57:32,185
i was dreaming.

1056
01:57:32,271 --> 01:57:33,340
Of Merlin?

1057
01:57:33,431 --> 01:57:35,547
Yes. He spoke to me.

1058
01:57:35,671 --> 01:57:37,184
i dreamed of him, too.

1059
01:57:38,151 --> 01:57:39,300
Merlin lives.

1060
01:57:43,031 --> 01:57:44,749
He lives in our dreams now.

1061
01:57:45,591 --> 01:57:47,343
He speaks to us from there.

1062
01:57:48,351 --> 01:57:50,660
He said i would fight bravely tomorrow.

1063
01:58:28,831 --> 01:58:31,982
i have returned, enchantress.

1064
01:58:33,751 --> 01:58:35,150
You are beautiful.

1065
01:58:35,791 --> 01:58:36,780
Yes.

1066
01:58:37,271 --> 01:58:38,386
Magnificent.

1067
01:58:39,591 --> 01:58:42,867
Have you used up all the magic
you stole from me...

1068
01:58:42,991 --> 01:58:45,107
...to keep yourself so young?

1069
01:58:46,431 --> 01:58:48,149
Have you any magic left...

1070
01:58:49,871 --> 01:58:51,748
...to do battle with Merlin?

1071
01:58:53,511 --> 01:58:57,902
Nothing to fear from an old man
you vanquished long ago...

1072
01:58:58,551 --> 01:59:01,702
...who only wants to see
how powerful you've become.

1073
01:59:03,791 --> 01:59:07,340
You see, Morgana,
you made me into a dream...

1074
01:59:08,231 --> 01:59:09,380
...a shadow.

1075
01:59:15,471 --> 01:59:16,460
A shadow.

1076
01:59:17,711 --> 01:59:20,179
You must be greater than ever i was.

1077
01:59:22,511 --> 01:59:24,342
i once released the Dragon's breath...

1078
01:59:24,431 --> 01:59:27,503
...so Uther could lie with your mother
and beget a king.

1079
01:59:29,951 --> 01:59:31,589
it almost destroyed me.

1080
01:59:33,711 --> 01:59:37,624
But i expect you could do it quite easily,
couldn't you?

1081
01:59:42,151 --> 01:59:43,470
i see no mist.

1082
01:59:46,151 --> 01:59:48,426
Have your powers faded, too?

1083
01:59:49,591 --> 01:59:50,626
The Charm.

1084
01:59:51,751 --> 01:59:52,820
That's it.

1085
01:59:53,791 --> 01:59:55,622
Use the Charm.

1086
01:59:58,591 --> 02:00:00,900
Have you forgotten the Charm of Making?

1087
02:00:03,591 --> 02:00:04,580
Use it.

1088
02:00:27,911 --> 02:00:30,061
Yes, use it.

1089
02:00:33,791 --> 02:00:34,860
That's it.

1090
02:00:35,111 --> 02:00:36,146
Oh, good.

1091
02:00:36,791 --> 02:00:38,110
Oh, that's grand.

1092
02:00:45,711 --> 02:00:48,271
That's better than i ever was.

1093
02:00:54,351 --> 02:00:55,306
Careful.

1094
02:00:55,991 --> 02:00:58,141
it can damage your beauty.

1095
02:01:18,471 --> 02:01:19,745
A fog is rising.

1096
02:01:20,551 --> 02:01:21,540
Fog?

1097
02:01:22,351 --> 02:01:23,545
That cannot be.

1098
02:01:26,391 --> 02:01:29,861
My mother has a sense for such things.
She said there would be no fog.

1099
02:01:29,951 --> 02:01:32,067
it will stand against us in battle.

1100
02:01:41,391 --> 02:01:42,380
Merlin?

1101
02:01:42,551 --> 02:01:44,940
Where are you? Where are you?

1102
02:01:46,111 --> 02:01:47,146
Mother?

1103
02:01:49,271 --> 02:01:51,387
My dear, sweet boy.

1104
02:02:36,391 --> 02:02:38,222
-Where are they?
-Listen.

1105
02:02:47,831 --> 02:02:49,947
They won't know
how few we are in the fog.

1106
02:02:50,031 --> 02:02:51,669
We'll use the old ways.

1107
02:02:52,351 --> 02:02:53,579
Speed up horse.

1108
02:03:02,471 --> 02:03:04,541
They're attacking from behind us!

1109
02:03:05,951 --> 02:03:07,828
-Turn about!
-Look to the rear!

1110
02:03:08,311 --> 02:03:09,744
You dogs, move!

1111
02:04:23,391 --> 02:04:26,064
-There are too many!
-We can't hold them!

1112
02:04:27,231 --> 02:04:29,950
Lancelot, is it you?

1113
02:04:34,991 --> 02:04:36,470
-is it true?
-it is.

1114
02:04:44,151 --> 02:04:45,584
Lancelot's with us.

1115
02:04:46,391 --> 02:04:48,143
He's back, he's with us.

1116
02:05:35,111 --> 02:05:36,305
Oh, my God!

1117
02:05:39,431 --> 02:05:40,659
Arthur!

1118
02:06:04,351 --> 02:06:05,466
Arthur....

1119
02:06:08,431 --> 02:06:09,466
Forgive.

1120
02:06:12,951 --> 02:06:16,307
My salvation is to die
a Knight of the Round Table.

1121
02:06:16,951 --> 02:06:19,260
You are that and much more.

1122
02:06:20,631 --> 02:06:22,349
You are its greatest knight...

1123
02:06:22,431 --> 02:06:24,786
...you are what is best in men.

1124
02:06:27,471 --> 02:06:29,427
it is the old wound, my king.

1125
02:06:31,031 --> 02:06:32,464
it has never healed.

1126
02:06:37,391 --> 02:06:38,540
Guenevere...

1127
02:06:40,791 --> 02:06:42,144
...is she queen again?

1128
02:06:42,231 --> 02:06:44,062
She is, Lancelot.

1129
02:06:53,911 --> 02:06:55,310
The fog is lifting.

1130
02:07:02,391 --> 02:07:04,188
No, Perceval.

1131
02:07:17,431 --> 02:07:18,750
Come, Father.

1132
02:07:19,271 --> 02:07:20,943
Let us embrace at last.

1133
02:07:47,151 --> 02:07:48,266
Perceval...

1134
02:07:49,991 --> 02:07:51,344
...take Excalibur.

1135
02:07:53,271 --> 02:07:55,660
Find a pool...

1136
02:07:56,991 --> 02:07:59,027
...of calm water...

1137
02:08:00,871 --> 02:08:03,908
...throw the sword into it....

1138
02:08:04,151 --> 02:08:05,106
No.

1139
02:08:05,631 --> 02:08:07,030
Obey me, Perceval.

1140
02:08:07,751 --> 02:08:09,582
Do it and return.

1141
02:09:42,431 --> 02:09:44,308
When you cast it in...

1142
02:09:45,751 --> 02:09:47,230
...what did you see?

1143
02:09:48,191 --> 02:09:49,465
i saw nothing...

1144
02:09:50,991 --> 02:09:52,822
...but the wind on the water.

1145
02:09:54,391 --> 02:09:56,109
My king, i couldn't do it.

1146
02:09:56,871 --> 02:09:58,543
Excalibur cannot be lost.

1147
02:09:59,071 --> 02:10:00,982
-Other men--
-Do as i command.

1148
02:10:03,191 --> 02:10:05,466
One day a king will come...

1149
02:10:06,351 --> 02:10:08,660
...and the sword will rise again.

1150
02:11:21,031 --> 02:11:22,225
Arthur!
