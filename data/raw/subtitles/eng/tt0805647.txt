1
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
All right, then.

2
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:27,999
Where were we?

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Now I remember.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,999
"A note about witches."

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
See, here's the thing
about them.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,999
They're real!

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,499
Witches are as real as a rock
in your shoe.

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,000
That's the first thing
you need to know.

9
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:48,000
The second thing
you need to know,

10
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:50,999
they're here!

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And they live amongst us...

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,999
...side by side, with humans.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
In every big city,
in every small town.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,999
For all you know,

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
a witch might be living right
next door to you right now.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,999
They everywhere!

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
A witch might be a nurse,

18
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:18,999
or your teacher,

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and you can bet
your sweet patootie

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,999
that friendly, little old lady
on the bus

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
offering you a delicious piece
of salt water taffy

22
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:31,999
is a witch.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,400
And here's
the most important thing.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The most important thing.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,999
Witches hate children!

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,999
A witch spends all her time

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
thinking up ways
to destroy children.

28
00:01:47,001 --> 00:01:48,999
That's all she thinks about.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
"How will I squish
this horrible child?"

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
A witch gets the same pleasure
from squishing a child

31
00:01:58,001 --> 00:02:01,000
as you get from eating
a bowl of ice cream

32
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:03,000
covered in butterscotch syrup,

33
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:05,000
with whipped cream,

34
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:05,999
chopped nuts,

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and a cherry on top.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
My story begins
during the last month of 1968.

37
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:22,000
Believe it or not,
I was once a young boy.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
A boy with a mother
and a father.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,999
We lived in Chicago.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And it snows a lot
at Christmastime.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Tricky thing with snow is,
it's slippery.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Take the front! This way!

43
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:54,999
Mom?

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,560
I was wearing my seat belt.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Dad?

46
00:02:58,001 --> 00:02:58,999
Mom!

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Mama and Daddy weren't.

48
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:03,000
Mama! Dad!

49
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:05,000
Mommy! Dad!

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,280
Let's get you out of here.

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It was during
my eighth Christmas

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,999
that I lost
my mother and father.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
My dear child...

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Grandma.

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Grandma's here.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Aw,
you gonna be all right.

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Here, let me look at you.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Mmm.

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,999
I'mma get you out of here.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I packed your things,
I'm gonna take you home.

61
00:03:53,001 --> 00:03:56,000
Home? To my house?

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
No, darling.

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Home to my house.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,999
Need any help

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,999
bringing these bags
inside, sister?

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Oh, no,
thank you, Reginald.

67
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:21,999
You've done enough already.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Running into you
at the bus station

69
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:24,999
was a godsend.

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm much obliged.

71
00:04:26,001 --> 00:04:27,999
My pleasure.

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,499
I'll see you in church
come Sunday?

73
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,000
Oh, you know you will.

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Pleasure to make
your acquaintance, young man.

75
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:36,999
Welcome to Demopolis.

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
- Thank you, Reggie.
- Sister.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,999
Wait.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Take them shoes off before
you walk on my good rug.

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Grandma was my mama's mama.

80
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,500
A tough lady with a big heart.

81
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:56,999
The kind that wouldn't hesitate

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,999
to give a spanking
if you deserve it

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
or a big ol' hug
if you needed it.

84
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:04,000
I reckon...

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
you'll be comfy here.

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
In your mama's old room.

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We'll get you situated tomorrow.

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm gonna make
some hot chocolate.

89
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:26,000
Want some?

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,999
I'm gonna make some anyway,

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
in case you change your mind.

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
High tomorrow, 73.

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Young man,
what is wrong with you?

94
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,000
Sitting in here
all by your lonesome.

95
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:19,000
It's nice out.

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,499
You want something to eat?

97
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,999
I just fried some wings.

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Nobody turns down my wings.
I'm gonna make you a plate.

99
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000

What you waiting for?

113
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Don't feel like eating.

114
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,999
And I don't feel like wasting
all this good food.

115
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What, you think I'm supposed
to feel sorry for you?

116
00:08:12,001 --> 00:08:13,500
Well, I don't.

117
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:15,000
Do I feel bad?

118
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:15,999
Yeah.

119
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But not sorry.

120
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Sometimes, whatever the good
Lord needs to teach us

121
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
comes in ways we don't see.

122
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,999
But it doesn't mean

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
we're not supposed
to learn something.

124
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Look here.

125
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,999
This was my baby.

126
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,499
I'd do anything
for her to be here right now.

127
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,249
But the Man Above
had another plan for her.

128
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,000
And whether it seems fair
to me or not,

129
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:44,000
it doesn't matter.

130
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Sometimes life isn't fair.

131
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,999
It's a hard lesson
for folks to learn

132
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
and most people don't have to
learn it this young.

133
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,499
But you do.

134
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,249
You hear me?

135
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Come on now, baby,
you got to eat something.

136
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You like cake?

137
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Well, corn bread
is basically cake.

138
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,999
Mmm-hmm.

139
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Go on. Try it.

140
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What's his name?

141
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,999
It's a she.

142
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Her name is something
you can ponder.

143
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Have you come up with a name
for your mouse yet?

144
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:24,999
Uh-huh.

145
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,999
Well, tell me.

146
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Don't be keeping me in suspense.

147
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:30,500
Aisy.

148
00:10:30,501 --> 00:10:31,999
Lazy?

149
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Well, that mouse
is full of nothing but energy.

150
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:36,000
She runs all the time
in that wheel.

151
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:38,000
Not "lazy."

152
00:10:38,001 --> 00:10:38,999
Daisy.

153
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,499
"Daisy." Oh.

154
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,999
I like it.

155
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That's a perfect name for her.

156
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:48,000

And somehow, she did it.

163
00:11:14,001 --> 00:11:15,999
Little by little,

164
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,499
with a tug here
and a pull there,

165
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,000

was being lifted,

170
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
there was another dark shadow
looming nearby.

171
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:36,999
Very nearby.

172
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,999
I didn't know it,

173
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
but I was about to meet
my first witch.

174
00:11:44,001 --> 00:11:47,000

Raymond.

179
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,499
You call these fresh?

180
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,000
But we just got them in.

181
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:12,999
When? Last year?

182
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,999
Look at how yellow they are.

183
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,999
And those brown spots
around the edges.

184
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm not gonna waste
good bacon drippings

185
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:20,120
on these shriveled-up weeds.

186
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Can you get me some fresh greens

187
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:23,000
if you don't mind?

188
00:12:23,001 --> 00:12:23,999
Yes, ma'am.

189
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'll see what we have
in the back.

190
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:25,999
You do that.

191
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Grandma, can I get these nails
to make Daisy a house?

192
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:33,000
Hmm.

193
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:35,000
Well, these aren't galvanized.

194
00:12:35,001 --> 00:12:37,000
You have to use galvanized nails

195
00:12:37,001 --> 00:12:37,999
so they won't rust.

196
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But galvanized costs
.35 cents more.

197
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:41,000
Safety first.

198
00:12:41,001 --> 00:12:41,999
Yes, ma'am.

199
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You cut yourself
on a rusty nail,

200
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:45,000
you can get lockjaw.

201
00:12:45,001 --> 00:12:45,999
Yes, ma'am.

202
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,640
And then I'd have to
flush out your system

203
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,999
with liver oil, garlic juice,
Tabasco sauce.

204
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You wouldn't want to go
through that now, would you?

205
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:52,000
No, ma'am.

206
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Good.
Remember, safety first.

207
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,499
Grandma knew how
to fix all kinds of ailments.

208
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,000
She learned from her grandma
how to use herbs and potions

209
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:05,999
and strange incantations

210
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,499
to make sick people good as new.

211
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,000
Here in Alabama,
where she grew up,

212
00:13:11,001 --> 00:13:13,000
Grandma was known as a healer.

213
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Galvanized.

214
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Boy.

215
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Boy.

216
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,499
Do you like sweets?

217
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
She is tame.

218
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Very sweet.

219
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Give her a kiss.

220
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,000
Young man.

221
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You want those nails,
you better come on...

222
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,999
Yes, Raymond,
that's more like it.

223
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Grandma,
I need to tell you something!

224
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:15,000
Not now, son.

225
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:16,000
But, Grandma...

226
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I thought
you wanted those nails.

227
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:20,000
Forget it. Let's just go.

228
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Yeah.

229
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,499
Let's just go.

230
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Hey.

231
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,999
Son,

232
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,999
what were you trying to tell me

233
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
in the grocery store
this morning?

234
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,499
You were shaking like a leaf.

235
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,249
Don't worry about that, Grandma.

236
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,000
I just want you to feel better.

237
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:51,000
I feel fine.

238
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,999
You just tell me
what you were trying to say.

239
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,040
Looked like you were about
to have a conniption fit.

240
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I don't know what I saw.

241
00:15:00,001 --> 00:15:01,000
It was a scary lady.

242
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,999
She called to me.

243
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
But when she did,
when she talked,

244
00:15:06,001 --> 00:15:07,999
her mouth...

245
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,999
Was she wearing gloves?

246
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Long ones, up to her elbows?

247
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,999
Was she wearing a hat?

248
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It looked like she had a towel
on her head or something.

249
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:19,999
And when she talked,

250
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,999
did her voice
sound ugly and scratchy

251
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
like an outhouse door
swinging on a rusty hinge?

252
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Oh.

253
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I feared this was happening.

254
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That lady you saw in
the grocery store was no lady.

255
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,000
What you saw

256
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,999
was a witch.

257
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:42,999
A witch?

258
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,999
That's right.

259
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
A no-good, rotten, low-down,
sneaky, sneaky witch.

260
00:15:49,001 --> 00:15:50,999
Okay. Okay.

261
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Is this you
and your church friends

262
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:53,999
trying to play a joke on me?

263
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
'Cause if it is,
it's not very funny.

264
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:56,999
Listen, child.

265
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Witches ain't nothing
to joke about.

266
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,999
I've known children

267
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
who no longer exist
as children on this earth.

268
00:16:05,001 --> 00:16:06,000
They were turned,

269
00:16:06,001 --> 00:16:07,999
transformed,

270
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
taken by witches.

271
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,999
I can tell you about Alice Blue.

272
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,999
Well, Alice Blue and I
were best friends.

273
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
We lived across the street
from each other.

274
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:24,999
We were like sisters.
Inseparable.

275
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
We did everything together,
even our chores.

276
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:31,000
But Alice was a lollygagger.

277
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Alice, quit lollygagging, girl.

278
00:16:34,001 --> 00:16:36,000
It's almost suppertime.

279
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Alice did something
no child should ever do.

280
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:57,000
She took candy from a stranger.

281
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,999
I got so scared,

282
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I tore out of there
like greased lightning,

283
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:05,000
and hightailed it straight home.

284
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I never should have
left Alice alone.

285
00:17:10,001 --> 00:17:12,000
I knew I shouldn't have.

286
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:14,000
But I was so scared.

287
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Later that night,

288
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,999
when I saw Alice alive,

289
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I was as happy as a mouse
in a bucket of cheese.

290
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,499
But the very next morning,

291
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,000
all that happiness went away

292
00:17:30,001 --> 00:17:32,000
because it happened.

293
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,200
She started turning.

294
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Alice was chicken-afied.
Chicken-alified.

295
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,999
Lordy!

296
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Look at the size
of that chicken.

297
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,320
Y'all seen
where Alice run off to?

298
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
She's right...

299
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:28,999
there.

300
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
What you
talking about, child?

301
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:31,999
Where'd she go?

302
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I tried to explain
what I saw,

303
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
but everybody was looking
at me like I was crazy.

304
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:41,000
Finally,
I just shut up about it.

305
00:18:41,001 --> 00:18:42,999
Although, I made it a point

306
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
to visit Alice
in her coop every day.

307
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:50,500
Hi, Alice.

308
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Alice even laid eggs.

309
00:18:59,001 --> 00:19:01,999
Big green ones.

310
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,499
Biggest green eggs I ever seen.

311
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,000
People said they were delicious.

312
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
What about the witch?

313
00:19:10,001 --> 00:19:11,000
What about her?

314
00:19:11,001 --> 00:19:12,000
Did she go away?

315
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:13,000
Oh, my, no.

316
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Once a witch come
into your life, it never...

317
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:20,500
Never...

318
00:19:20,501 --> 00:19:23,000
Oh, my, Lord in Heaven.

319
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,999
What am I thinking?

320
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I just told you
we saw a witch today.

321
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,999
A witch in the grocery store.

322
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,999
And what am I doing?
Sitting here

323
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
like I'm blind in one eye
and can't see out the other,

324
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:39,000
wasting precious time
lollygagging.

325
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,999
Always wondered

326
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,999
what Grandma kept
in that locked closet.

327
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Turns out it was full of
medicinal herbs and elixirs,

328
00:19:52,001 --> 00:19:55,000
and old books
about ancient healing.

329
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,999
Now, my mom always said

330
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Grandma was sort of
a country-type healer.

331
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:05,000
But now I was starting to think

332
00:20:05,001 --> 00:20:08,000
she might be a voodoo priestess.

333
00:20:08,001 --> 00:20:09,999
Child, we need to leave.

334
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
- Leave?
- That's right, leave.

335
00:20:13,001 --> 00:20:14,000
It's not safe for us here.

336
00:20:14,001 --> 00:20:15,000
But where we gonna go?

337
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,999
I'll call my cousin, Eston.

338
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,999
Have him make
a reservation for us

339
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
at the Grand Orleans
Imperial Island Hotel.

340
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
He was the executive chef
there for over 30 years.

341
00:20:26,001 --> 00:20:27,000
He's got pull there.

342
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:29,000
He's a star.

343
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,999
His cooking
put that hotel on the map.

344
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's the swankiest resort
in all of Alabama.

345
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,500
You'll be telling your grandkids

346
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:38,999
about your stay in this hotel.

347
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
How do you know
we'll be safe there?

348
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:43,000
Because, child,

349
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,999
ain't nothing
but rich white folks

350
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
at the Grand Orleans
Imperial Island Hotel.

351
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And witches
only prey on the poor,

352
00:20:50,001 --> 00:20:51,500
the overlooked,

353
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:52,999
the kids they think

354
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
nobody's gonna make a fuss
about if they go missing.

355
00:20:54,001 --> 00:20:55,000
Go pack!

356
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,999
Grandma, are there
witches in every city?

357
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Every city,
every state, every country.

358
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:12,000
And there's
a secret society of witches

359
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:14,000
in every country called a coven.

360
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
That's just like a Rotary Club
but for witches.

361
00:21:18,001 --> 00:21:19,999
They all get together
in one place

362
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,999
and gossip about
who they put spells on,

363
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
or trade potion secrets,
and whatnot.

364
00:21:24,001 --> 00:21:25,000
But most important,

365
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
they receive orders
from the Grand High Witch.

366
00:21:29,001 --> 00:21:29,999
The Grand High Witch?

367
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,999
The Grand High Witch, yeah.

368
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,499
She's the ruler of them all.

369
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,999
All-powerful, pure evil,

370
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,999
and without a stitch of mercy.

371
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Yeah. Legend has it,
she was hatched

372
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:44,000
on the frozen tundra of Norway.

373
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Now, take a look at that.

374
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
What, you just gonna stand there

375
00:22:09,001 --> 00:22:11,000
and stare at me all day?

376
00:22:11,001 --> 00:22:12,999
Can I help you?

377
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You can unload this car while
I check in to this here hotel.

378
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,000
Yes, ma'am.

379
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:18,000
Here's the key.

380
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Oh, and...

381
00:22:22,001 --> 00:22:22,999
No.

382
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You keep your money, ma'am.

383
00:22:26,001 --> 00:22:28,000
And enjoy yourself.

384
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:29,999
I think I will.

385
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Grandma was right
about this hotel.

386
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,999
It sure was fancy.

387
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
She brought us
to the Gulf of Mexico

388
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:38,999
to get away from that witch.

389
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
But she had no idea what
we were about to step into.

390
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,440
Be careful with the mouse.

391
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,999
- No.
- For God's sake,

392
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I think you're being
extremely unreasonable.

393
00:22:51,001 --> 00:22:52,500
No, Deidre.
For the last time,

394
00:22:52,501 --> 00:22:53,750
I will not have that woman
in my house.

395
00:22:53,751 --> 00:22:55,000
Oh,
she's very good company.

396
00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:56,500
Absolutely not, Deidre.

397
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:58,000
Oh, for God's sake,

398
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,999
Bruno, your face.

399
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Obviously can't
take you anywhere.

400
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Here you are, ma'am.

401
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Come on, we got our key.

402
00:23:16,001 --> 00:23:18,999
We are in room 766.

403
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Sounds like a good room.

404
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,639
You okay, Grandma?

405
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,280
That's the first time
you coughed

406
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,999
since we left the house.

407
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,999
Can I help you, madam?

408
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,999
Oh! You must be
Eston's cousins.

409
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Yes, he insisted
that you stay in room 766.

410
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,999
That's the Magnolia.

411
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
This is one of
our most lovely junior suites.

412
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And aren't you
a lucky fella? Hmm?

413
00:23:46,001 --> 00:23:47,999
It's not every day

414
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,976
that a young gentleman
such as yourself is fortunate

415
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
to come and stay in such
a fine hotel as this now,

416
00:23:53,001 --> 00:23:54,000
is it?

417
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Come on, Gatsby.

418
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:57,000
Let's go.

419
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,999
Let's go find our room.

420
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,999
Would you like me to show you?

421
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,999
- It's on the fourth floor.
- Mmm.

422
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Grandma,
if we're on the fourth floor,

423
00:24:04,001 --> 00:24:05,999
why is it number 7-6-6?

424
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Because the man who built
this hotel was a numerologist.

425
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:09,999
He believed
numbers have meaning.

426
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,999
I know a little something
about numbers.

427
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Seven and six together
means a test is coming.

428
00:24:15,001 --> 00:24:16,999
Two sixes mean abundance.

429
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So, it look like
a big test might be coming.

430
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,999
Well, hello there.

431
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,999
The Grand Orleans
Imperial Island Hotel

432
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
welcomes you and your lovely
group of benefactresses.

433
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,720
Uh, I would just like to say
that we applaud

434
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
your innumerable,
uh, philanthropic...

435
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
acts and, um...

436
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And, um...

437
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,999
I'm sorry, madam,

438
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,999
but the hotel has
a very strict no-pet policy.

439
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You seem like the sort of man

440
00:25:15,001 --> 00:25:16,500
who loves a precious.

441
00:25:16,501 --> 00:25:17,999
Don't you, Mister...

442
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Stringer. R. J. Stringer III.
Hotel Manager.

443
00:25:21,001 --> 00:25:22,999
Thank you
for making an exception,

444
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,999
- Mr. R. J. The Hotel Manager.
- Stringer.

445
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Yes, but I haven't yet...
But I didn't agree...

446
00:25:27,001 --> 00:25:30,000
So, tell me something, Mister...

447
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
- Stringy?
- Stringer.

448
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,999
Hotel man.

449
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,999
- Manager.
- The third.

450
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,499
- Yeah.
- I know you love kitties.

451
00:25:40,001 --> 00:25:44,000
But what do you think of...

452
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,500
mice?

453
00:25:45,501 --> 00:25:46,999
Mice?

454
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,999
Yeah. Mice.

455
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,999
What would you do
if there were mice

456
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,499
running all around
in this hotel?

457
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,749
Well, I can assure you, madam,

458
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,999
there would never be any mice...

459
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
But if there were?
Hypothetically?

460
00:26:04,001 --> 00:26:06,000
Mmm. Oh, hypothetically.

461
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Yes, I suppose,
well, I would, uh...

462
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:11,000
I would call the exterminator.

463
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:13,000
Exactly!

464
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,999
You see, girls?

465
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
He would call the exterminator!

466
00:26:20,001 --> 00:26:21,999
Just like any normal human

467
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,999
with his head screwed on right,

468
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
he would exterminate
those brats.

469
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,999
Uh... Rats.

470
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
We would exterminate the rats.

471
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,999
Evil.

472
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
There's no other way
to describe them.

473
00:26:41,001 --> 00:26:43,500
Pure, unvarnished evil.

474
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:45,999
That's what witches are.

475
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Now, you see
this here cough of mine?

476
00:26:55,001 --> 00:26:56,999
It was likely brought on
by a witch.

477
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Probably that one you saw
in the grocery store.

478
00:26:59,001 --> 00:27:00,999
Really? A witch
can make you cough?

479
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,499
Oh, you bet
your sweet patootie they can.

480
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,999
Grandma, how can you tell
a real witch from

481
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Well, first of all, witches
aren't really women at all.

482
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:14,999
They're demons in human shape.

483
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
That's why if you look closely
at a witch,

484
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
you'll notice the corners
of her mouth is elongated,

485
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:22,999
stretching almost
up to her ears,

486
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,499
and that's usually hidden
with pancake makeup.

487
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,000
And a real witch always
wears gloves. Always.

488
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:33,000
Because a real witch
doesn't have hands.

489
00:27:33,001 --> 00:27:34,000
She's got claws.

490
00:27:34,001 --> 00:27:34,999
Claws?

491
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And they don't have toes. Ooh.

492
00:27:40,001 --> 00:27:41,999
Their ugly feet look like

493
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
their toes got chopped off
with an axe.

494
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,999
And all witches are bald.

495
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
As bald as a boiled egg.

496
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,000
So, they wear wigs.

497
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,499
And it gives them nasty sores.

498
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,249
"Wig rash," the witches call it.

499
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,000
Mmm! And it makes them crazy.

500
00:27:59,001 --> 00:28:00,000
So, gloves,

501
00:28:00,001 --> 00:28:00,999
wigs.

502
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Is that everything?

503
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,999
Nose-holes.

504
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
- Nose-holes?
- Yeah. Nostrils.

505
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:07,999
Nose-holes.

506
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Witches have larger nose-holes
than normal people.

507
00:28:11,001 --> 00:28:13,000
When they need
to sniff out a child,

508
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,999
those nose-holes can grow out

509
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
as big as eight inches
in diameter.

510
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
But, mind you, children
smell horrible to witches.

511
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,520
Even if the kid
just had a bath?

512
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,999
That makes it worse.

513
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
A freshly clean kid smells
like dog poop to a witch.

514
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:33,000
- Dog poop?
- That's right.

515
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:34,999
And the cleaner the kid,

516
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,999
the poopier he smells
to a witch.

517
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Maybe I should
stop taking baths.

518
00:28:39,001 --> 00:28:40,000
Child, don't test me.

519
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Can a witch come in here
and get us while we sleep?

520
00:28:45,001 --> 00:28:46,999
No.

521
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,999
Not at all.

522
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Witches never do
silly things like

523
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
climbing drainpipes or
breaking into people's houses.

524
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:59,500
Besides, they have no idea
where we are.

525
00:28:59,501 --> 00:29:03,000
Okay, but I'm still
a little scared.

526
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Over here, come on, little man.

527
00:29:06,001 --> 00:29:08,000
There we go.

528
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Get some sleep.

529
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Hmm?

530
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Really?

531
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,999
Mmm.

532
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,999
The next morning,

533
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,999
the sun was shining
and the air was crisp

534
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I kept quiet as a mouse
so Grandma could sleep in,

535
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,999
and I took it upon myself

536
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
to order her
some room service breakfast.

537
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

538
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,999
Here's your breakfast, Grandma.

539
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Scrambled eggs,
chicken fried steak,

540
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
hominy grits, pecan sticky buns,

541
00:30:57,001 --> 00:30:58,999
rhubarb strawberry jam,

542
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
and a pitcher
of sweet iced tea with mint.

543
00:31:02,001 --> 00:31:05,000
Oh, that sure smells special.

544
00:31:05,001 --> 00:31:08,000
Oh, mercy, I slept in late.

545
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,999
Phew.

546
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,499
Well, thank you for ordering
me breakfast, darling.

547
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,000
I gave the room service guy
a half a dollar tip.

548
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:16,999
Was that okay?

549
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
That's mighty
gentlemanly of you.

550
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,999
Grandma, are you okay?

551
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,999
I'm fine.
Just a little tickle.

552
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,999
Grab Grandma
that glass of tea.

553
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,499
And listen, Grandma's gonna
take it easy today.

554
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,000
But I want you to get outside
and run around.

555
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,999
Go down to the water.
Have fun.

556
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I was thinking I would do
some training with Daisy.

557
00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:41,000
Oh! Well, take her with.

558
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,800
Just don't let her get
too close to the water.

559
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I wouldn't want
some big old sea snake

560
00:31:45,001 --> 00:31:46,000
to grab ahold of her.

561
00:31:46,001 --> 00:31:47,999
Sea snake?

562
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I'm just joshing.
There ain't no sea snakes.

563
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,999
You go on now. Have fun.

564
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And don't worry about me.
I'm fine.

565
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:57,280
Even though I knew

566
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Grandma was kidding
about the sea snakes,

567
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,000
I didn't wanna take any chances,

568
00:32:02,001 --> 00:32:04,000
so we stayed inside.

569
00:32:04,001 --> 00:32:05,999
And wouldn't you know,

570
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
we came upon the big ballroom
where it turns out

571
00:32:09,001 --> 00:32:10,000
the International Society

572
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children folks

573
00:32:13,001 --> 00:32:16,000
were gonna have
their conference.

574
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,999
Hey!

575
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,999
You there!

576
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,999
And what are you doing?

577
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,499
Breaking and entering?

578
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,000
Looking for a quiet spot.

579
00:32:28,001 --> 00:32:29,500
For what?

580
00:32:29,501 --> 00:32:30,999
Training.

581
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Training what?

582
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,999
Cool. Super.
What's his name?

583
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,499
It's a she.
And her name is Daisy.

584
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,999
Can I hold her?

585
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
She's not too comfortable
around strangers.

586
00:32:46,001 --> 00:32:48,999
Can she do any tricks
or anything?

587
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,520
We were just about
to do some training.

588
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,999
Wanna watch?

589
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,999
What time is it?

590
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,999
A nice lady told me
to meet her here at 12:25.

591
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
She said she would give me
six bars of Swiss chocolate.

592
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:02,000
What's your name?
I'm...

593
00:33:02,001 --> 00:33:02,999
Bruno Jenkins!

594
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I've been looking for you
everywhere, young man.

595
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:08,000
Your father is furious.

596
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:08,999
Hello, Mother.

597
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
This is my new friend.

598
00:33:11,001 --> 00:33:11,999
Nice to meet you.

599
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,999
Look at your hands,
they're filthy!

600
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Look at your shirt!
It's a complete mess!

601
00:33:18,001 --> 00:33:19,500
- Come with me.
- Ow!

602
00:33:19,501 --> 00:33:20,999
What have you been doing?

603
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Running around
in a sausage factory?

604
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,999
The room
was completely empty.

605
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
A perfect place for me
and Daisy to do our training.

606
00:33:49,001 --> 00:33:49,999
And I figured,

607
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
if all the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children people

608
00:33:53,001 --> 00:33:53,999
showed up,

609
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
they would probably look kindly

610
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:56,999
on a young mouse trainer

611
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
who was just
going about his business.

612
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Jeez, that scared
the crap out of me.

613
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,999
So, here we are.

614
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,999
Here is the Le Grand
Imperial Ballroom

615
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,999
or Le Salon Grande,
as we call it.

616
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,499
Well, actually
we call it the Mural Room

617
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,999
because of all these
beautiful murals...

618
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I was told there is only
one door in and out, yeah?

619
00:34:57,001 --> 00:34:57,999
Yeah. Yes.

620
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
There's, uh, only that door
there, in and out,

621
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:02,999
and which, of course,

622
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
does not make
the fire marshal very happy.

623
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:09,000
So, don't you go
starting any fires.

624
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
This room will do.

625
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,999
Right, so...

626
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Yeah, so, if there's any...
Is there anything else

627
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:29,000
- that you ladies...
- No.

628
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,500
- No?
- Bye-bye.

629
00:35:30,501 --> 00:35:32,000
Oh, all right.

630
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Saoirse,
secure the room!

631
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Okay, you so-called ladies.

632
00:36:06,001 --> 00:36:09,000
Prepare for removal.

633
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Wake up.

634
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Okay, you trussed-up succubines,

635
00:37:10,001 --> 00:37:14,000
you may remove your gloves.

636
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
You may remove your shoes.

637
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,999
And...

638
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,000
you may remove your wigs!

639
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,499
They're all witches.

640
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,249
My blood ran cold

641
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:19,000
as I started to get real scared.

642
00:38:19,001 --> 00:38:19,999
Here I was,

643
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
trapped in a room with a bunch
of bald-headed witches!

644
00:38:25,001 --> 00:38:28,000
And the mean one,
the bald-head honcho

645
00:38:28,001 --> 00:38:29,999
who was standing right above me,

646
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,999
the one who was
giving all the orders,

647
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,999
as soon as I got
a good look at her,

648
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I knew instantly
who she had to be.

649
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
She's the Grand High Witch.

650
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Witches.

651
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Witches.

652
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,999
You are a heap

653
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
of good-for-nothing worms!

654
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
This morning,

655
00:39:16,001 --> 00:39:16,999
I'm having my breakfast

656
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
and I'm looking out
the window, at the beach,

657
00:39:21,001 --> 00:39:24,500
and what am I seeing? Hmm?

658
00:39:24,501 --> 00:39:27,999
What am I seeing?

659
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I'm seeing dozens...

660
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:31,999
I'm seeing hundreds...

661
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I'm seeing hundreds
of repulsive little brats

662
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,999
playing in the sand,

663
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
and it's putting me
right off my food!

664
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
So...

665
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Here are my orders.

666
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I want every child
in the world...

667
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,999
rubbed out!

668
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,999
Squashed, squirted,
and frittered!

669
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,999
Your Excellency,
do you have a plan?

670
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
How can we possibly
wipe out every child?

671
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,499
That was actually
a good question.

672
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,000
Insubordinate
but a good question.

673
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,999
Of course I have a plan.

674
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I want each of you to return
to your pathetic little town.

675
00:40:50,001 --> 00:40:50,999
And open...

676
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,999
a candy store.

677
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,999
And in this store you will sell

678
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
only the highest quality,
tastiest candy.

679
00:41:05,001 --> 00:41:08,999
Now, you're probably wondering,

680
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
"Where do I get the money
to buy a candy shop?"

681
00:41:12,001 --> 00:41:17,000
Well, I have
thought of that too.

682
00:41:17,001 --> 00:41:22,000
In my room, room number 666,

683
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:23,999
I have a steamer trunk

684
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
filled with brand-new,
crisp $100 bills!

685
00:41:27,001 --> 00:41:28,999
Room 666.

686
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Remember that room number 666

687
00:41:34,001 --> 00:41:35,999
and your shops will sell

688
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
only the highest quality,
tastiest candy.

689
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
And...

690
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,999
We use Formula Number 86

691
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Delayed Action Mouse Maker!

692
00:41:54,001 --> 00:41:55,999
Ooh!

693
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
One drop of Mouse Maker
in a piece of candy

694
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:03,000
will transform
a dirty little child

695
00:42:03,001 --> 00:42:06,000
into a mouse in one hour!

696
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,499
Ah!

697
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,999
Two drops

698
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
will transform the disgusting
little brat in 30 minutes.

699
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:18,000
And three drops
is instantaneous.

700
00:42:18,001 --> 00:42:21,000
An instant mouse!

701
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,000
Oh.

702
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Oh, no, no, no.

703
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Shut up.

704
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,999
So,

705
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,999
less than an hour ago,

706
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I found a repulsive smelly
little boy in the lobby

707
00:42:48,001 --> 00:42:51,000
and I gave him
an outrageously expensive

708
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:52,999
bar of Swiss chocolate.

709
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
A chocolate bar
that was laced with one drop

710
00:42:57,001 --> 00:42:58,999
- of my Number 86...
- Oh, no.

711
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,976
...Delayed
Action Mouse Maker potion!

712
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:01,999
Bruno.

713
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,280
And I told
the greedy little brat

714
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,999
to meet me here at 12:25.

715
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,999
So, in less than 10 minutes,

716
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,000
all you pathetic witches will
see what a true genius I am!

717
00:43:16,001 --> 00:43:19,000
Genius! Genius! Genius!

718
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,999
Quiet!

719
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Where's my chocolate?

720
00:44:14,001 --> 00:44:15,999
It's the greedy little cretin.

721
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,320
- Quick! Put on your wigs!
- Hey, are you in there?

722
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,999
Welcome, you...

723
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
fine, handsome man.

724
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:30,999
We've been waiting.

725
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,499
Darling boy.

726
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,000
I have your chocolate for you.

727
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
You promised me
six bars of chocolate.

728
00:44:55,001 --> 00:44:59,000
I only see one in your hand.

729
00:44:59,001 --> 00:45:00,999
Hmm... You see, ladies,

730
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
not only is he fat and stupid
but greedy too.

731
00:45:06,001 --> 00:45:09,000
Mmm.

732
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
That's right, little man.

733
00:45:21,001 --> 00:45:24,500
Here is your
delicious chocolate.

734
00:45:24,501 --> 00:45:28,000
Come and get it.
Come and get it.

735
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Get ready, girls.

736
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,999
Ten seconds.

737
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,999
Give me my chocolate.
Give it to me.

738
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
It's right here, my darling.

739
00:45:39,001 --> 00:45:41,000
Daisy, what do we do?

740
00:45:41,001 --> 00:45:41,999
Give me.
Give me.

741
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,999
Five seconds.

742
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Give me my chocolate.
Give it to me.

743
00:45:47,001 --> 00:45:47,999
Three...

744
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
- Give me it. Give me. Give me!
- Two...

745
00:45:50,001 --> 00:45:51,000
One...

746
00:45:55,001 --> 00:45:57,500
Ignition!

747
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,999
That smelly brat,

748
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,999
that horrid louse

749
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,999
has been transformed...

750
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
She's done it.
She's a genius.

751
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
...into a lovely little mouse!

752
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,999
What's the big idea?

753
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Where's my chocolate?

754
00:46:50,001 --> 00:46:52,000
Squish him!

755
00:46:52,001 --> 00:46:52,999
Whoa!

756
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Squish him! Kill him!

757
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,999
He's right there.

758
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,499
They turned Bruno
into a mouse

759
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,000
and now they're trying
to squish him.

760
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I'll fetch him.

761
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Did you just talk?

762
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:16,999
It's a swarm!

763
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
They're everywhere!

764
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Get him.
Where is he? Where is he?

765
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,999
Gosh! You're a giant.
Why are you so big?

766
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I'm not big.
You're little. I'm normal.

767
00:47:36,001 --> 00:47:37,500
How can I be little?

768
00:47:37,501 --> 00:47:39,000
Because you're a mouse.

769
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
A witch put a spell on you.

770
00:47:41,001 --> 00:47:43,500
Witch? What witch?

771
00:47:43,501 --> 00:47:45,750
Ah-ha! I knew it!

772
00:47:45,751 --> 00:47:48,000
Dog dropping!

773
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
- Help!
- Grab him.

774
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:53,500
- Help! Help me!
- Hold him down.

775
00:47:53,501 --> 00:47:56,000
- Flip him. Gag position.
- Help! Help!

776
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Open his trap.

777
00:48:01,001 --> 00:48:02,999
Open it.

778
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,999
Okay.

779
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,999
That's how you wanna play,

780
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,000
we'll play the Shakespeare way.

781
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,499
One drop...

782
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Two...

783
00:48:25,001 --> 00:48:28,000
Blast off.

784
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Yes! Yes!

785
00:48:34,001 --> 00:48:35,000
Yes!

786
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Aren't you a cute little mouse?

787
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Who has the mallet?

788
00:49:20,001 --> 00:49:22,000
- Here! Here!
- Get the mallet.

789
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:23,500
Where's the mallet?

790
00:49:23,501 --> 00:49:24,999
I'm not afraid of nothing.

791
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
I have him.
Where's the mallet?

792
00:49:28,001 --> 00:49:32,000
Come on. Give it to me.
Give it to me.

793
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,999
Run, Bruno, run!

794
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:39,999
So, you're a mouse too?

795
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Now I've got you.

796
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Four legs, Bruno.

797
00:49:52,001 --> 00:49:53,500
Four legs.

798
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Rats! A dead end!

799
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Run, Bruno, run!

800
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:06,000
No!

801
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Ow, my back.

802
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,499
What happened to us?

803
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,999
Why are we mouses?

804
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,999
- "Mice."
- Whatever.

805
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
There's a convention of
witches here in the hotel,

806
00:50:35,001 --> 00:50:36,500
and they have an evil potion.

807
00:50:36,501 --> 00:50:38,000
They put it in your chocolate.

808
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:39,999
My chocolate? Crikey!

809
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,499
They always spike the chocolate.

810
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,000
It's standard
evil witch procedure.

811
00:50:45,001 --> 00:50:47,000
Wait. You were a kid too?

812
00:50:47,001 --> 00:50:47,999
A girl.

813
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Do I look like
a baby goat to you?

814
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:53,999
Nope, a mouse.

815
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,999
What are we going to do?

816
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,999
I don't want to be a mouse.

817
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I like being
a portly little kid.

818
00:51:00,001 --> 00:51:01,000
"Child."

819
00:51:01,001 --> 00:51:01,999
Whatever.

820
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,999
All right,
we have to find my grandma.

821
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,999
She knows
everything about witches.

822
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
She'll know what to do.
Come on.

823
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,499
Two crab salads.
What are you doing?

824
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:18,000
Wow, look at
all that lovely food.

825
00:51:18,001 --> 00:51:20,000
Okay, here's what we do.

826
00:51:20,001 --> 00:51:20,999
You see that vent?

827
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,499
I bet that'll get us
to the lobby. Let's go.

828
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,999
Pick that up.
That's white truffle.

829
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
You have any idea
how much white truffle costs?

830
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:31,000
Wipe it off
and put it in the sauce.

831
00:51:31,001 --> 00:51:34,000
What is this?
You call that puffed?

832
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Let's get some more hands
in here.

833
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,999
So, now what?

834
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Look, all we need to do is
make our way to the elevator,

835
00:51:49,001 --> 00:51:50,000
then up to the fourth floor.

836
00:51:50,001 --> 00:51:52,000
Come on.

837
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Hey, a little help.

838
00:51:56,501 --> 00:51:57,999
Crikey.

839
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
- Hurry up.
- This way.

840
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,499
I just realized
something, y'all.

841
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:24,000
How exactly do we
reach the button

842
00:52:24,001 --> 00:52:26,000
- Floor?
- Four, please.

843
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Come on.

844
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
There's my room, 766.

845
00:52:46,001 --> 00:52:48,000
This way.

846
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
She's never
going to hear us.

847
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
A doorbell.

848
00:53:04,001 --> 00:53:06,000
Come on.

849
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Crikey!

850
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
All right.
We make a human ladder.

851
00:53:40,001 --> 00:53:41,500
You mean a mouse ladder?

852
00:53:41,501 --> 00:53:43,000
Right, a mouse ladder.

853
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Ow! Ow.

854
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I got... I got...

855
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,160
I got it!

856
00:54:01,001 --> 00:54:02,999
Help me!

857
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Ahhh, great balls of fire,
don't let me fall!

858
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
- Phew.
- Follow me, boys.

859
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,999
Mice!

860
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Mice! Mice!

861
00:54:36,001 --> 00:54:38,000
They everywhere!

862
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:53,999
Grandma, it's me.

863
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,280
Grandma, it's me, your grandson.

864
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,499
My grandson...

865
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,999
Is that you, boy?

866
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Yes, Grandma, it's me.

867
00:55:02,001 --> 00:55:04,000
Oh... Oh.

868
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:06,999
Is it really you?

869
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:07,999
It's really me.

870
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
- What happened?
- It was the Grand High Witch.

871
00:55:11,001 --> 00:55:11,999
The Grand High Witch?

872
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Oh, Lord,
not the Grand High Witch.

873
00:55:14,001 --> 00:55:14,999
Yes. She mouse-afied me.

874
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,999
And the whole hotel
is full of witches.

875
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,499
They're having a witch
convention or something.

876
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,000
You been through so much,
you don't need this.

877
00:55:22,001 --> 00:55:23,999
Grandma's so, so sorry.

878
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,999
Grandma,
please get off the floor

879
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,999
and put me on the coffee table.

880
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
- How do I do that?
- Pick me up.

881
00:55:30,001 --> 00:55:30,999
Pick you up?

882
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,280
Yeah, just like I pick up Daisy.

883
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Right.

884
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,999
I can't believe
this happened to you.

885
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Believe me,
things could be a lot worse.

886
00:55:44,001 --> 00:55:45,000
They could?

887
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,999
Oh, Grandma, by the way,

888
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
this is my friend,
Bruno Jenkins.

889
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
He's now a mouse too,

890
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:53,999
but he used to be
a chubby, little English kid.

891
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,000
You could've just stopped at,
"This is my friend, Bruno."

892
00:55:58,001 --> 00:55:58,999
I'm so sorry, Bruno.

893
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Those nasty, evil witches
got you too, huh?

894
00:56:02,001 --> 00:56:04,000
Yes. They got me good
and proper.

895
00:56:04,001 --> 00:56:05,999
It's been an awful day.

896
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,999
- Anybody else hungry?
- Ahem!

897
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,999
Oh, and Daisy used to be
a kid... A girl too.

898
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Why didn't you
say something before, darling?

899
00:56:13,001 --> 00:56:15,000
Because it can be very dangerous

900
00:56:15,001 --> 00:56:15,999
for a mouse to talk.

901
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Most people don't understand
and they get scared.

902
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
I almost said something
the other night

903
00:56:22,001 --> 00:56:22,999
when you told the story

904
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
about Alice Blue
getting turned into a chicken,

905
00:56:25,001 --> 00:56:26,999
but I thought better of it.

906
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
So, some wicked, evil witch
mouse-afied you.

907
00:56:30,001 --> 00:56:31,999
Yes, ma'am, four months ago.

908
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
On the very same afternoon
I ran away from the orphanage.

909
00:56:36,001 --> 00:56:38,000
Well, what happened was,
a kind lady...

910
00:56:38,001 --> 00:56:39,999
Well, I thought she was kind.

911
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Anyway, she offered me
a chocolate bar,

912
00:56:42,001 --> 00:56:44,000
and before I knew it, poof!

913
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:45,999
I was transformed.

914
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,999
Then, faster than a hot knife
cuts through butter,

915
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
a panhandler scoops me up
and sells me to a pet store

916
00:56:52,001 --> 00:56:54,000
so he could buy food.

917
00:56:54,001 --> 00:56:55,999
Yum!

918
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,999
I'm so sorry, Daisy.

919
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Mary. Uh, my real name
is Mary.

920
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Mary. That's a pretty name.

921
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:02,999
Excuse me.

922
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
All this talk about food
is making me really hungry.

923
00:57:06,001 --> 00:57:08,000
Can I have one of those grapes?

924
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
So, it was
the Grand High Witch,

925
00:57:13,001 --> 00:57:14,999
and she's in this very hotel?

926
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
We got to do something to turn
you back. Make this right.

927
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:20,000
The Grand High Witch
has a room full of potion.

928
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:21,999
And she's gonna use it

929
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
to turn every kid in the world
into a mouse.

930
00:57:24,001 --> 00:57:24,999
We have to help them.

931
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
- Who is it?
- Hotel maintenance.

932
00:57:29,001 --> 00:57:31,000
Quick, hide.

933
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Here. Hop in my knitting tote.

934
00:57:36,001 --> 00:57:38,000
Keep your heads down.

935
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:46,999
Yes.

936
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:47,999
I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am,

937
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
but we got a report of
a possible rodent infestation.

938
00:57:50,001 --> 00:57:52,500
Rodent infestation?
In a hotel this expensive?

939
00:57:52,501 --> 00:57:55,000
That's crazier than
a hog on slaughter day.

940
00:57:55,001 --> 00:57:57,000
Yes, ma'am.
It's probably nothing.

941
00:57:57,001 --> 00:57:58,999
The maid who said
she saw the rodents

942
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
has a tendency to be
a bit high-strung.

943
00:58:01,001 --> 00:58:02,500
- Mmm.
- But, to be on the safe side,

944
00:58:02,501 --> 00:58:04,000
I thought
I'd lay these here traps,

945
00:58:04,001 --> 00:58:05,999
- if you don't mind.
- Okay.

946
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
- We put them in all the rooms.
- Mmm-hmm.

947
00:58:08,001 --> 00:58:09,999
Just to be safe.

948
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
So, uh, what are they? Mice?

949
00:58:14,001 --> 00:58:14,999
Oh. No, ma'am.

950
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Maid said she saw
a swarm of huge, ugly rats.

951
00:58:18,001 --> 00:58:20,000
At least a dozen of them.

952
00:58:20,001 --> 00:58:20,999
Goodness, a dozen?

953
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,999
Well, it's like I said,

954
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
she has a tendency to be
a bit high-strung.

955
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Fresh Wisconsin cheddar.

956
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Drives them rodents plumb crazy.

957
00:58:35,001 --> 00:58:37,000
They can't resist it.

958
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,999
Mmm...

959
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Anyway, you hear any
of these traps start snapping,

960
00:58:46,001 --> 00:58:47,000
give me a call.

961
00:58:47,001 --> 00:58:48,000
I sure will.

962
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:49,999
That's right.

963
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Don't you know anything?
Grapes can hurt a mouse.

964
00:58:53,001 --> 00:58:53,999
All right, you three.

965
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,999
You stay away from
those traps, you hear?

966
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,120
If we could just get our hands
on some of that potion,

967
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,999
I might be able
to reverse-engineer it.

968
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,999
Make it a potion
that turns mice into children.

969
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,999
I always travel with
my anti-hex herbs and salts.

970
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
But whoever knows where
that wicked, evil witch is.

971
00:59:10,001 --> 00:59:11,999
We do. She's in room 666.

972
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,999
We heard her tell
all those witches

973
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
to meet her in room 666
right after dinner.

974
00:59:17,001 --> 00:59:18,999
And we're in room 766.

975
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Room 666 is right below us.

976
00:59:21,001 --> 00:59:22,999
Good Lord!

977
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
That evil sorceress is living
right beneath us?

978
00:59:25,001 --> 00:59:25,999
Yes. And here's what we do.

979
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
We wait for the Grand High
Witch to leave her room,

980
00:59:28,001 --> 00:59:30,000
then we use
Grandma's knitting wool

981
00:59:30,001 --> 00:59:31,040
as a rope to lower me down

982
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
to the Grand High Witch's
balcony.

983
00:59:33,001 --> 00:59:34,040
I grab a bottle of potion,

984
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Grandma hoists me back up,
she reverses the spell,

985
00:59:37,001 --> 00:59:39,999
and ta-da!
We're kids again.

986
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Young man, you think
all that up just now?

987
00:59:43,001 --> 00:59:45,999
Popped right into my head.

988
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Vile, filthy brats.

989
00:59:59,001 --> 01:00:01,000
You make me puke!

990
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,999
Hades,

991
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:05,999
it's getting so bad,

992
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,999
I can't even enjoy
a glass of wormwood.

993
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
She's the Grand High Witch,
all right.

994
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,999
Grandma, that's the potion.

995
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,999
She's keeping it on ice.

996
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,499
Yeah, it's exactly what we need.

997
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,999
Hades, come.

998
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
We are late for tea.

999
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Teatime. Perfect.

1000
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,499
Now look, all we need
is one bottle of potion.

1001
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,249
So, grab one as fast
as you can and hurry on back.

1002
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:59,000
No telling when that monster
is fixing to return.

1003
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
I know you're
likely scared, baby.

1004
01:01:03,001 --> 01:01:04,000
I'm not scared, Grandma.

1005
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:05,999
I don't know why,

1006
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
but ever since I was turned
into a small mouse,

1007
01:01:08,001 --> 01:01:10,000
little things
don't scare me anymore.

1008
01:01:10,001 --> 01:01:13,000
Okay. Hold on tight.

1009
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,999
I can't believe

1010
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
they won't let my precious
into the dining room.

1011
01:02:34,001 --> 01:02:37,000
This fleabag, roach-trap hotel

1012
01:02:37,001 --> 01:02:40,000
discriminates
against everything.

1013
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Money.
Money, money, money.

1014
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,999
Oh, Hades,

1015
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,999
why, in this disgusting
human world,

1016
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
do you need money
for everything?

1017
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Disgusting, filthy lucre.

1018
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
He's ready.

1019
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,999
Well, well, well, well.

1020
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Why is this wool here, I wonder?

1021
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,999
Oh. Hello.

1022
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I just dropped my knitting
over the balcony.

1023
01:04:15,001 --> 01:04:16,000
But it's all right.

1024
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Thank goodness I still have
a hold of it on this end.

1025
01:04:19,001 --> 01:04:21,000
Well, I'm just gonna
go ahead on and...

1026
01:04:21,001 --> 01:04:22,999
And pull it on up.

1027
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
I'll be out of your way.

1028
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Let go.

1029
01:04:27,001 --> 01:04:29,000
I know you.

1030
01:04:29,001 --> 01:04:30,999
Me?

1031
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:31,999
I don't think so.

1032
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,499
I have seen you before.

1033
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:34,999
I remember your face.

1034
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
You mighta seen me
in the lobby, maybe.

1035
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,499
No, no, no, no, no.

1036
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:41,999
Not in the lobby.

1037
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,999
I remember you from...

1038
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
What? Who is it?

1039
01:04:47,001 --> 01:04:49,000
It's Mr. Stringer III,

1040
01:04:49,001 --> 01:04:49,999
Hotel Manager.

1041
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Curses!

1042
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
You want me to remove

1043
01:05:01,001 --> 01:05:01,999
the children from the beach?

1044
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,999
I want them removed.

1045
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Well, I'll...
I'll see what I can do.

1046
01:05:06,001 --> 01:05:09,000
Madam, I procured this,
uh, for you today.

1047
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I thought you might like it.

1048
01:05:11,001 --> 01:05:13,000
It's a kitty carrier.

1049
01:05:13,001 --> 01:05:13,999
And I thought

1050
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
you could put your feline
friend in there and you can

1051
01:05:17,001 --> 01:05:19,000
transport him
all over the hotel,

1052
01:05:19,001 --> 01:05:21,500
including the dining room.

1053
01:05:21,501 --> 01:05:24,000
Thought you might like that.

1054
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,999
Well,

1055
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:34,000
let me tell you something,
Mister Cat-Cage-Procurer.

1056
01:05:34,001 --> 01:05:35,999
I will never, ever

1057
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,000
allow my precious puss to be...

1058
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Well, look at that.
He likes it in there.

1059
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,080
Oh, madam, I almost forgot.

1060
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Regarding your ladies' dinner
this evening,

1061
01:05:54,001 --> 01:05:57,000
we have neglected
to select a soup.

1062
01:05:57,001 --> 01:05:57,999
Now, there are two choices.

1063
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,999
One is our
Cajun spice crab Creole,

1064
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
and the other one is our
plantation kitchen split pea.

1065
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:07,500
Which one is cheaper?

1066
01:06:07,501 --> 01:06:11,000
Well, madam,
I'm sure you will appreciate

1067
01:06:11,001 --> 01:06:13,500
that the crab is fresh
and it is...

1068
01:06:13,501 --> 01:06:16,000
Which one?

1069
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Plantation kitchen split pea.
That's the one.

1070
01:06:21,001 --> 01:06:25,000
Then we will have
the split pea soup.

1071
01:06:25,001 --> 01:06:26,999
Yes, madam.

1072
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,499
And...

1073
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:32,000
no garlic in the soup.

1074
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,999
No what?

1075
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Garlic.

1076
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,499
No garlic?

1077
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,749
Did I stutter?

1078
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:46,874
No garlic.

1079
01:06:46,875 --> 01:06:48,999
My women,

1080
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:54,000
all suffer from a selective
food avoidance disorder.

1081
01:06:54,001 --> 01:06:56,000
Picky eaters.

1082
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,499
Yes, madam.
As you wish.

1083
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:02,000
I will inform the chef.

1084
01:07:02,001 --> 01:07:04,000
You do that.

1085
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
I'll let myself out.

1086
01:07:07,001 --> 01:07:10,000
You do that.

1087
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Well, my precious,

1088
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:24,000
since you enjoy being
in that cage so much,

1089
01:07:24,001 --> 01:07:26,000
you can stay in it!

1090
01:07:26,001 --> 01:07:28,000
Traitor!

1091
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,200
Mouse Maker potion.

1092
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
A drop of hyssop...

1093
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,000
A smidgen of mugwort...

1094
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:53,999
And now,

1095
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,499
a dash of healing water,
straight from Lourdes.

1096
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:59,000
This is the most powerful
healing water there is.

1097
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,999
Okay.

1098
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Now let's all join hands
and bow our heads.

1099
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Well, I'll be...

1100
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Not much more to say
than that.

1101
01:08:46,001 --> 01:08:49,000
We had to try something, kids.

1102
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,999
This witch's power

1103
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
is far greater
than my little home remedies.

1104
01:08:56,001 --> 01:08:57,999
Evil power.

1105
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,499
And strong.

1106
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,749
Much stronger than me.

1107
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:05,000
Please don't cry, Grandma.

1108
01:09:05,001 --> 01:09:06,000
It'll be okay.

1109
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,499
I'm sorry, children.

1110
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,749
It's not your fault, Grandma.

1111
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:13,000
Sometimes things just happen.

1112
01:09:13,001 --> 01:09:15,000
Yeah, they do.

1113
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I actually don't mind
being a mouse.

1114
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
I get to hang out
with my new friends all day,

1115
01:09:23,001 --> 01:09:25,000
don't have to go
to school anymore,

1116
01:09:25,001 --> 01:09:26,999
and I don't have to learn
how to drive,

1117
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
which means I'll never
get into an accident.

1118
01:09:29,001 --> 01:09:32,999
Oh, child.
Come here.

1119
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Grandma, will you still
take care of me?

1120
01:09:35,001 --> 01:09:35,999
Even if I stay a mouse?

1121
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Of course
I will, darling.

1122
01:09:38,001 --> 01:09:39,500
Doesn't matter who you are

1123
01:09:39,501 --> 01:09:40,999
or what you look like,

1124
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
so long as somebody loves you.

1125
01:09:43,001 --> 01:09:45,000
And I always will.

1126
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,999
What about my friends?

1127
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,999
Can they stay too?

1128
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,999
Well, of course.

1129
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,999
If they want to,

1130
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
but don't forget,
they all have loved ones

1131
01:10:00,001 --> 01:10:01,999
I'm not so sure about that.

1132
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Don't be a fool.
I'm sure they love you.

1133
01:10:04,001 --> 01:10:05,999
My mother thinks I'm clumsy,

1134
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
and my father complains
that I'm always hungry.

1135
01:10:09,001 --> 01:10:11,000
Well, maybe this will
help them love you

1136
01:10:11,001 --> 01:10:14,000
for who you are,
not for who you ain't.

1137
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:17,000
You're fortunate
to have parents, Bruno.

1138
01:10:17,001 --> 01:10:18,999
Some of us don't.

1139
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
But we're gonna be okay.

1140
01:10:20,001 --> 01:10:21,999
We have Grandma.

1141
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,499
And she'll always be our family.

1142
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:27,000
And for that
we are very blessed.

1143
01:10:27,001 --> 01:10:27,999
But what I wanna know

1144
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,999
is why are we standing
around here lollygagging?

1145
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
How are we gonna stop
those horrible witches

1146
01:10:34,001 --> 01:10:36,000
from turning
more children into mice?

1147
01:10:36,001 --> 01:10:37,999
She's right.

1148
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,999
We got to do something.

1149
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,999
I know what we'll do.

1150
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
I sneak into the kitchen with
the Number 86 Mouse Maker,

1151
01:10:45,001 --> 01:10:47,000
then I slip the potion
into the witches' pea soup

1152
01:10:47,001 --> 01:10:48,999
and turn them all into mice.

1153
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,999
Are you sure about this,
little man?

1154
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
This sounds like
it could be a very dangerous

1155
01:10:54,001 --> 01:10:54,999
and scary mission.

1156
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Trust me, Grandma,
I can handle it.

1157
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,999
I'll meet you in the lobby bar.

1158
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Bruno and Daisy know which vent.

1159
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:13,500
Be careful, darling.

1160
01:11:13,501 --> 01:11:15,000
I will, Grandma.

1161
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,999
Hurry up there!

1162
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
The pea soup is ready.

1163
01:11:42,001 --> 01:11:42,999
No garlic.

1164
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
I got the soup,
no garlic, Chef,

1165
01:11:45,001 --> 01:11:45,999
coming right up.

1166
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,999
Where are my prawns?

1167
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,999
This is not a prawn,
this is a shrimp.

1168
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
You don't know the difference
between a shrimp and a prawn?

1169
01:11:53,001 --> 01:11:56,500
Count the pincers.
Un, deux. One, two.

1170
01:11:56,501 --> 01:12:00,000
Let's start ladling out
that soup.

1171
01:12:00,001 --> 01:12:01,999
Come on, you people.

1172
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Yes, Chef.

1173
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,499
What are you doing, huh?

1174
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,000
I'm getting
the prawns ready.

1175
01:12:11,001 --> 01:12:12,999
Don't tell me
that's a prawn.

1176
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
- I'm a crustacean expert.
- This is a prawn.

1177
01:12:14,001 --> 01:12:15,000
I've been
sauteing prawns for 30 years

1178
01:12:15,001 --> 01:12:16,999
and I only use butter.

1179
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,999
- Only butter?
- Never oil.

1180
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
I don't give a damn
about what nutritionists say.

1181
01:12:21,001 --> 01:12:23,000
They are
the ruination of cuisine.

1182
01:12:23,001 --> 01:12:26,000
Always butter, butter only.

1183
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,999
Where are my prawns?

1184
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Who do I have to get
some prawns around here?

1185
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Let's start
ladling out that soup.

1186
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,499
Yes, Chef.

1187
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:47,999
Are you crying?

1188
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
There's no crying in my kitchen.

1189
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,999
Chef, this soup
needs some garlic.

1190
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Absolutely no garlic.
Stringer's orders.

1191
01:12:57,001 --> 01:12:58,000
Grease fire.

1192
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
We got fire
blankets under those sinks.

1193
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Are those my prawns
that just exploded?

1194
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Forget the prawn, just throw
some shrimp in there.

1195
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,000
You idiots don't know how...

1196
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Someone get me a sharp knife
so that I can kill myself.

1197
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Somebody call an exterminator.

1198
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Look, there's my mother
and father.

1199
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
That's your mother and father?

1200
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:44,999
As I live and breathe.

1201
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Bruno, I think it's time
to say hello to your parents.

1202
01:13:48,001 --> 01:13:50,000
Are you mad?
Right here in the bar?

1203
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
There's no time
like the present.

1204
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Excuse me,
are you Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins?

1205
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Can we help you?

1206
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:09,999
I'm afraid I have some,

1207
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,000
well, strange news
about your son, Bruno.

1208
01:14:14,001 --> 01:14:16,999
What about Bruno?
Where is he?

1209
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,999
Maybe we can go somewhere
a bit more private.

1210
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Private?
Why do we have to be private?

1211
01:14:23,001 --> 01:14:24,999
It's not an easy thing
for him to explain.

1212
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
He'd be much more comfortable
we all went up to your room.

1213
01:14:28,001 --> 01:14:28,999
No, no, look here, madam,

1214
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,999
I'm perfectly comfortable
exactly where I am.

1215
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
So, either you tell me
where I can find Bruno

1216
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:36,000
or you just leave us alone now.

1217
01:14:36,001 --> 01:14:37,000
Well...

1218
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
got him right here.

1219
01:14:41,001 --> 01:14:42,000
That's a mouse! A mouse!

1220
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,499
What in God's name
is wrong with you?

1221
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:46,000
Get that filthy rodent
out of here!

1222
01:14:46,001 --> 01:14:47,999
No, no, no, no. This is Bruno.

1223
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,281
Bruno, say something to them.

1224
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,999
"Say something"?
Are you insane?

1225
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,999
Get away from us
before I call the manager.

1226
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Quit all this hollering.
This is your son, Bruno.

1227
01:14:59,001 --> 01:15:00,999
Manager! Someone get me
the manager.

1228
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,999
This woman has just scared
my wife half to death.

1229
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
She's walking around
with rats in her handbag.

1230
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Bruno, why didn't
you say something?

1231
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,000
My father hates it when I talk
with my mouth full.

1232
01:15:14,001 --> 01:15:16,000
Psst! Grandma.

1233
01:15:16,001 --> 01:15:16,999
Down here.

1234
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
There you are.
Thank the Lord.

1235
01:15:20,001 --> 01:15:21,000
So, how'd it go?

1236
01:15:21,001 --> 01:15:24,000
Soup is on.

1237
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Look! The pea soup.

1238
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Here we are,
garlic free.

1239
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Excuse me, madam,
may I have a word with you?

1240
01:15:45,001 --> 01:15:47,000
Please, this way.

1241
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Just over here.

1242
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:52,999
Um...

1243
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,000
You wouldn't happen
to be carrying around a mouse

1244
01:15:56,001 --> 01:15:58,000
on your person now, would you?

1245
01:15:58,001 --> 01:15:59,999
- A mouse?
- Mmm-hmm.

1246
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,999
Why on earth would I
be carrying around a mouse?

1247
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Does this have anything to do
with all the rat traps

1248
01:16:04,001 --> 01:16:05,280
being set up
all over this hotel?

1249
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:06,999
Rat traps?

1250
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,999
Is this your pathetic idea
of a smoke screen?

1251
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,999
Accusing your guests
of carrying around mice

1252
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,000
to hide the fact that this
hotel has a mouse infestation.

1253
01:16:14,001 --> 01:16:15,500
Shh. No... Shh. What?

1254
01:16:15,501 --> 01:16:16,999
I'll tell you this.

1255
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,499
For what this hotel
is costing me,

1256
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:20,000
I better not see a single mouse.

1257
01:16:20,001 --> 01:16:22,000
Not even a tiny, cute one.

1258
01:16:22,001 --> 01:16:24,000
Yes, madam. I'm so...

1259
01:16:24,001 --> 01:16:26,000
My mistake. I'm sorry.

1260
01:16:26,001 --> 01:16:27,999
Luther.

1261
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Would you please show
this lady to our finest table?

1262
01:16:30,001 --> 01:16:32,000
Certainly.
This way.

1263
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:33,999
Apologies, madam,

1264
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
- I, it's just...
- Mmm.

1265
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,999
Our finest table, madam.

1266
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,999
Oh, uh, thank you, Luther.
I'm sure

1267
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,499
your finest table
in this lovely establishment

1268
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:51,000
is this one right here
next to the kitchen.

1269
01:16:51,001 --> 01:16:53,000
I always prefer
a table near the exit

1270
01:16:53,001 --> 01:16:55,000
so I can get out fast.

1271
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
- Of course.
- Mmm.

1272
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Check it out.

1273
01:17:30,001 --> 01:17:31,999
They love the soup.

1274
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,999
Have you decided?

1275
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,999
Uh, yes, I think
I'll have the jambalaya.

1276
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Excellent. And would you like
something to start?

1277
01:17:41,001 --> 01:17:42,000
Mmm...

1278
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,999
Well, that pea soup

1279
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
those fancy ladies are eating
looks good.

1280
01:17:46,001 --> 01:17:46,999
I'll have that.

1281
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,999
I'm sorry.
That soup is reserved

1282
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
strictly for that group
of lady guests only.

1283
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:53,999
If I may,

1284
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,999
that large party suffers
from a severe garlic allergy.

1285
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,000
So, they have requested their
soup be prepared garlic free.

1286
01:18:00,001 --> 01:18:03,000
It is very bland.
Practically inedible.

1287
01:18:04,501 --> 01:18:05,999
I see.

1288
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,999
That sounds disgusting.

1289
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
May I suggest
the Cajun spice crab Creole?

1290
01:18:12,001 --> 01:18:15,000
It's one
of our signature dishes.

1291
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Uh, sounds...

1292
01:18:21,001 --> 01:18:22,999
Yes?

1293
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Uh, the... The shrimp Creole
will be fine.

1294
01:18:26,001 --> 01:18:28,000
You mean
the crab Creole?

1295
01:18:28,001 --> 01:18:30,000
Yes, yes, the crab Creole.

1296
01:18:30,001 --> 01:18:32,000
Very good.

1297
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Keep your heads down,
we got company.

1298
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Pigtails.

1299
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:56,999
I'm sorry?

1300
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,999
Pigtails.

1301
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,999
You wore pigtails.

1302
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,999
Do I know you?

1303
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Many years ago,
in a shabby little town.

1304
01:19:13,001 --> 01:19:14,500
A shabby little town

1305
01:19:14,501 --> 01:19:17,250
right here in Alabama.

1306
01:19:17,251 --> 01:19:20,000
You wore pigtails.

1307
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
And you got away from me.

1308
01:19:24,001 --> 01:19:26,000
Remember?

1309
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,999
But I got

1310
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,000
that horrid little friend
of yours.

1311
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Remember...

1312
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Quick, mouse ladder.

1313
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:52,999
It was you.

1314
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
You were the filthy witch
who turned Alice.

1315
01:19:57,001 --> 01:19:58,999
Aw...

1316
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,000
That's a nasty...

1317
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,999
What are you doing?

1318
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Grandma, look.

1319
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,000
Attaboy.

1320
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,999
High five, baby!

1321
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Mmm-hmm! That's some
serious ratification.

1322
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Oh, my God!
It's on my leg!

1323
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Ooh. Lordy,
hell's a-poppin'.

1324
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Come here, you nasty critter...

1325
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Get it off!
Get it off!

1326
01:22:02,001 --> 01:22:03,000
Get it off!

1327
01:22:06,501 --> 01:22:07,999
Come on, kids.

1328
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,999
It's time to skedaddle.

1329
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Somebody call the exterminator!

1330
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Good job.

1331
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Ooh, ooh...

1332
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Look at all this potion.

1333
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Kids, we got
to grab every bottle.

1334
01:22:56,001 --> 01:22:58,000
Hey, Grandma, what about him?

1335
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
I'll call the manager to let
him out once we out of here.

1336
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Oh, I dropped some.

1337
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,000
I'll get it, Grandma.

1338
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Whoa, that cheese
smells awfully good.

1339
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Look what you made me do.

1340
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,999
You think you're so clever,

1341
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,999
breaking into my room
with a stolen key?

1342
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,499
But everyone knows they keep
a spare key at the front desk.

1343
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:36,000
We'll never let you get away
with your filthy, evil plot.

1344
01:24:36,001 --> 01:24:39,000
Oh, no?
Who's gonna stop me?

1345
01:24:39,001 --> 01:24:40,999
A feeble, stupid,

1346
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,000
sick woman like you?

1347
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Oh, you think that's funny?

1348
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:50,999
Not that.

1349
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,999
See, I was just thinking.

1350
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:57,499
Pretty soon, you not gonna
be able to do much of nothing.

1351
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:02,000
And why is that, brave,
little, soon-to-be-dead woman?

1352
01:25:02,001 --> 01:25:04,000
The pea soup.

1353
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
The pea soup...

1354
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,999
No... No...

1355
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,000
No...

1356
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,499
You stupid fool.

1357
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:29,000
I did not drink the pea soup.

1358
01:25:29,001 --> 01:25:31,000
If you recall,

1359
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,999
I was interrupted.

1360
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Okay,
here's what we're gonna do.

1361
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Well, well, well.

1362
01:25:42,001 --> 01:25:44,500
Let me see.

1363
01:25:44,501 --> 01:25:46,999
I think

1364
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,499
I will reach into your chest

1365
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:54,000
and rip out your withered,

1366
01:25:54,001 --> 01:25:55,999
shriveled heart,

1367
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,999
and squeeze it until it bursts.

1368
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,999
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1369
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
All your butt-ugly witch-talk
don't scare me one bit.

1370
01:26:05,001 --> 01:26:06,999
It should,

1371
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
considering the last thing
you will ever see

1372
01:26:09,001 --> 01:26:12,000
is my snickering face.

1373
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:18,999
I believe

1374
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,000
with every fiber of my being...

1375
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,999
that in the end,

1376
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:29,000
love will always triumph
over hatred and evil.

1377
01:26:29,001 --> 01:26:30,999
Is that so?

1378
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,999
You may have turned
Alice and my grandson,

1379
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,000
but I will make sure
you never turn another child.

1380
01:26:37,001 --> 01:26:38,000
So help me, God.

1381
01:26:38,001 --> 01:26:39,000
Now!

1382
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,000
You stupid rat.

1383
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,499
Look what you've done.

1384
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:56,999
Run!

1385
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Look what you've done.

1386
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
You stupid rodents.

1387
01:28:04,001 --> 01:28:06,000
Get back here!

1388
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,999
You filthy pests.

1389
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,499
- Yum.
- Parasites.

1390
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:13,749
Kid, I'm gonna get you,

1391
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:15,999
you putrid varmints.

1392
01:28:21,001 --> 01:28:23,000
Now I've got you!

1393
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:26,999
What?

1394
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
I'm done listening
to your trash talk.

1395
01:28:29,001 --> 01:28:31,000
What is this?

1396
01:28:36,001 --> 01:28:38,000
You fool.

1397
01:28:38,001 --> 01:28:39,999
Let me out.

1398
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Let me out!

1399
01:28:42,001 --> 01:28:45,000
Let me out! Let me out!

1400
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

1401
01:28:50,001 --> 01:28:52,500
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

1402
01:28:52,501 --> 01:28:55,000
I will rip out your tongues.

1403
01:28:55,001 --> 01:28:55,999
Stupid mice.

1404
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,999
The witch in a bottle...

1405
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,999
- Let me out.
- Witch in a bottle...

1406
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Let me out
of this stupid fish bowl.

1407
01:29:02,001 --> 01:29:05,000
Hey, Grandma, this is the key
to that big trunk.

1408
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,999
That's my key.
That's my key.

1409
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,999
That's my key,
you pea-brain brat.

1410
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
- You pea-brain parasites.
- Come on, guys.

1411
01:29:12,001 --> 01:29:13,999
Nah, nah...

1412
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Put your tongue
back in your mouth,

1413
01:29:16,001 --> 01:29:19,000
you filthy sewer guttersnipes.

1414
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,999
What are you doing?

1415
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,280
What are you doing?
That is mine.

1416
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,000
- Ooh!
- That's mine.

1417
01:29:27,001 --> 01:29:29,000
You idiots. You scoundrels.

1418
01:29:29,001 --> 01:29:31,000
That is a lot of bacon.

1419
01:29:31,001 --> 01:29:32,999
- Lettuce.
- Dough.

1420
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,999
Hey, you're making me
terribly hungry.

1421
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,999
No, get your hands off
of that, that's mine!

1422
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,999
Get your filthy paws
off my filthy lucre.

1423
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:45,000
I'll poke out your beady eyes.
What are you looking at?

1424
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
What's that, Grandma?

1425
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
It's a list of names
and addresses

1426
01:29:51,001 --> 01:29:52,000
of every witch in the world.

1427
01:29:52,001 --> 01:29:52,999
Wow!

1428
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,999
With that list and that money
and all this potion,

1429
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,000
we could turn every witch
in the world into rats.

1430
01:29:59,001 --> 01:29:59,999
Excellent!

1431
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
I'll cut off your tails

1432
01:30:02,001 --> 01:30:03,999
with rusty scissors.

1433
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:08,000
I'll clip your ears
with toenail clippers.

1434
01:30:08,001 --> 01:30:10,000
I'll poke out your beady eyes.

1435
01:30:10,001 --> 01:30:13,999
I'll get you for this!

1436
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,499
All right,
kiddies, one hop.

1437
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:19,000
We got work to do.

1438
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
I almost forgot.

1439
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,000
No, no, no, don't do that.

1440
01:30:30,001 --> 01:30:33,000
What are you doing?

1441
01:30:33,001 --> 01:30:34,999
Hades.

1442
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,999
Good pussy.

1443
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,000
You are a good pussy cat.

1444
01:30:40,001 --> 01:30:40,999
Nice kitty.

1445
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
- You two have fun now.
- Nice kitty.

1446
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Ah, you stupid,
mangy fleabag. Precious.

1447
01:30:48,001 --> 01:30:48,999
Put the books back.

1448
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Stay back,
you stupid, precious...

1449
01:30:53,001 --> 01:30:54,999
No! Hades.

1450
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Hades, precious,
remember who feeds you.

1451
01:31:00,001 --> 01:31:00,999
No, don't think about food.

1452
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Grandma, you hear that?

1453
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,999
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1454
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
I didn't hear a thing.

1455
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Oh! Well, thank you kindly.

1456
01:31:21,001 --> 01:31:24,000
And one for you.

1457
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:25,999
The next morning,

1458
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,499
we were feeling joyful
and triumphant.

1459
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:30,999
As a matter of fact,
Grandma was so happy,

1460
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:35,000
she was spreading her joy
to the entire hotel staff.

1461
01:31:35,001 --> 01:31:36,280
Thank you kindly for everything.

1462
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,999
One for you.

1463
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,999
And one for you.

1464
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Thank you, ma'am.

1465
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Bruno tried to explain

1466
01:31:48,001 --> 01:31:49,000
the situation to his mom.

1467
01:31:49,001 --> 01:31:50,000
Hello, Mother.

1468
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
I'm now a mouse.

1469
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,976
- It's a mouse!
- But it turned out

1470
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins
weren't really mouse people.

1471
01:32:02,001 --> 01:32:03,999
So, we decided it would be best

1472
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:07,000
if Bruno came to stay with me,
Grandma, and Daisy.

1473
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Faster, faster!

1474
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,999
Here we go!

1475
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:42,999
Whee!

1476
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,000
- Cool!
- Whoo-hoo!

1477
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,000
How's my hair look?
How's my hair?

1478
01:32:50,001 --> 01:32:53,000
Whoo-hoo!

1479
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Whoo-hoo!

1480
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Let's go again, y'all.

1481
01:32:58,001 --> 01:33:00,000
This time
I sit in the front.

1482
01:33:00,001 --> 01:33:03,000
Grandma, I love being a mouse.

1483
01:33:03,001 --> 01:33:04,999
Oh, I believe you do.

1484
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
But you wanna know
something weird?

1485
01:33:06,001 --> 01:33:08,000
I still feel just like a boy.

1486
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
But you are, darling.

1487
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:11,500
Life changes all of us.

1488
01:33:11,501 --> 01:33:12,999
I mean, look at me.

1489
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,999
I'm getting on up in the years,

1490
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,999
but I still feel like a girl.

1491
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
And I still feel like a boy.

1492
01:33:19,001 --> 01:33:20,999
See?

1493
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
You get it.

1494
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,999
Never give up
what you are inside.

1495
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:30,000
When I look at you, I don't
see whiskers and a pink nose.

1496
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,999
I just see your eyes.

1497
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Bright and beautiful.

1498
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Grandma,

1499
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,999
how long does a mouse live?

1500
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,999
Oh, an ordinary mouse
only lives about three years,

1501
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,000
but you're no ordinary mouse.
You're a mouse-person,

1502
01:33:48,001 --> 01:33:50,500
and a mouse-person
will almost certainly live

1503
01:33:50,501 --> 01:33:53,000
three times longer
than an ordinary mouse.

1504
01:33:53,001 --> 01:33:55,000
Maybe even longer.

1505
01:33:55,001 --> 01:33:56,999
That's great news.

1506
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,000
I couldn't stand being
looked after by anybody else.

1507
01:34:00,001 --> 01:34:00,999
I'll be a very old mouse

1508
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
and you'll be
a very old grandmother,

1509
01:34:03,001 --> 01:34:06,000
and we'll both die together.

1510
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,999
With a little luck, darling.

1511
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:13,000
But no one knows how long
their time is on this earth.

1512
01:34:13,001 --> 01:34:15,000
Only God knows that answer.

1513
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:22,000
And that is
the natural order of things.

1514
01:34:22,001 --> 01:34:24,000
Daisy, Bruno, and I

1515
01:34:24,001 --> 01:34:26,500
loved living with Grandma.

1516
01:34:26,501 --> 01:34:29,000
We were one big, happy family.

1517
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Where were we?
Oh, yeah. That's right.

1518
01:35:36,001 --> 01:35:37,000
So, here we are,

1519
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,999
ready to carry on the fight.

1520
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,999
Carry on the fight!

1521
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,499
Over the years, we have turned
and mouse-afied

1522
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:49,000
every damnable witch
in these United States.

1523
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,000
So, we are gathered here
to take our battle

1524
01:35:54,001 --> 01:35:56,000
to the entire world.

1525
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:01,000
- You have your names, correct?
- Yes, sir.

1526
01:36:01,001 --> 01:36:02,120
Your addresses?

1527
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:03,999
Yes, sir.

1528
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:07,999
And your Number 86
Mouse Maker potion?

1529
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Yes, sir. Number 86
Mouse Maker potion, sir.

1530
01:36:13,001 --> 01:36:14,999
Let's get out there

1531
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:20,000
and give those witches
a taste of their own medicine.

1532
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:41,000
So, you ready for this
mission, old-timer?

1533
01:36:41,001 --> 01:36:45,000
Grandma,
I've never been more ready.
