1
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:52,037
What's up, fellas?

2
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,271
Where were you?
I stopped by to give you a lift.

3
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:57,933
Had things to do. How's the party?

4
00:02:58,113 --> 00:02:59,909
Don't know. Just got here.

5
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:02,082
Well, hell, boys...

6
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,619
...let's drop in.

7
00:03:07,323 --> 00:03:09,087
Oh, shit, yeah.

8
00:03:10,027 --> 00:03:11,187
Tyler!

9
00:03:12,097 --> 00:03:14,895
Come on, Caleb.
It's not like it's gonna kill us...

10
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,458
...yet.

11
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,133
So give me the scoop. Who's here?

12
00:03:53,311 --> 00:03:56,212
The first thing you have to know
is that Aaron Abbot is a prick.

13
00:03:56,382 --> 00:03:58,543
- Treats girls like dirt.
- Okay.

14
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,549
- Who's that?
- The new guy.

15
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:02,087
He's looking over here.

16
00:04:02,256 --> 00:04:04,553
Don't know much about him,
but I intend to find out.

17
00:04:04,726 --> 00:04:06,455
He's cute.

18
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:10,562
- Hey, who's that chick with Kate?
- Sarah something.

19
00:04:10,732 --> 00:04:12,860
She transferred in
from a Boston public.

20
00:04:13,402 --> 00:04:15,494
She's kind of hot.

21
00:04:22,212 --> 00:04:25,376
- Yo, Caleb.
- They're here.

22
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,484
- Who are they?
- The Sons of Ipswich.

23
00:04:31,122 --> 00:04:34,025
- Hey, Kate.
- Caleb.

24
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:38,890
- Hi. You're late.
- I had a thing with the family.

25
00:04:39,565 --> 00:04:41,728
- Who's this?
- My new roommate.

26
00:04:41,904 --> 00:04:44,463
Sarah, this is Pogue Parry,
Tyler Simms...

27
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,372
...Reid...
- Garwin. Reid Garwin.

28
00:04:48,544 --> 00:04:49,704
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

29
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,676
You know,
Sarah's my grandmother's name.

30
00:04:51,847 --> 00:04:54,612
- You kind of remind me of her.
- Caleb Danvers.

31
00:04:54,785 --> 00:04:57,754
And you don't bring
my grandmother to mind in any way.

32
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,353
Good. Sarah.

33
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,784
- Hey, Caleb.
- Kira.

34
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:06,189
How was your summer?

35
00:05:10,736 --> 00:05:12,966
- I'm Kira.
- Sarah.

36
00:05:13,138 --> 00:05:15,732
Oh, right. From the Boston public.

37
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:20,107
Tell me, how does one go about
getting into Spenser from a public?

38
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,512
- Why don't you give it a rest, Kira?
- Why don't you give it a rest?

39
00:05:23,684 --> 00:05:26,588
- I don't want any trouble, Aaron.
- I'm sure you don't.

40
00:05:27,156 --> 00:05:28,817
You posers make me wanna puke.

41
00:05:28,992 --> 00:05:30,822
- Is that right?
- Hey, let it go.

42
00:05:31,627 --> 00:05:34,256
I think you owe Kira an apology.

43
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:40,098
Actually, I think
Kira owes Sarah the apology.

44
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:47,512
You were being kind of bitchy.

45
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,648
Disgusting! You idiot!

46
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:57,150
Guys, Dylan just called.

47
00:05:57,326 --> 00:06:00,192
He said he saw three cop cars
headed this way on Old Dell Road.

48
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,953
- Hey, let's roll!
- Let's go.

49
00:06:02,131 --> 00:06:03,688
- Let's go, boys.
- Let's go!

50
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:13,165
- You need a ride?
- No, Sarah drove us out here.

51
00:06:13,345 --> 00:06:16,974
- Will I see you back at the dorms?
- It's getting late. I'm just gonna crash.

52
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:18,912
Call me in the morning?

53
00:06:19,485 --> 00:06:22,852
- I could use a lift.
- No problem.

54
00:06:23,022 --> 00:06:26,083
- Hey, nice going back there. Caleb.
- Chase.

55
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:28,387
Thought that guy and I
were about to go at it.

56
00:06:28,563 --> 00:06:31,087
His friend's puking
sure came at an opportune time.

57
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,528
Didn't it, though?

58
00:06:37,407 --> 00:06:39,397
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hop in my truck.

59
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:43,413
- Good night.
- I got room. Who needs a ride?

60
00:06:44,081 --> 00:06:46,810
Hey, guys, let's go.
We gotta go before the cops come.

61
00:06:48,686 --> 00:06:50,381
Sarah wants you, man.

62
00:06:50,555 --> 00:06:53,217
- That's bullshit.
- Oh, now. Don't be jealous, Reid.

63
00:06:55,195 --> 00:06:57,662
- My car won't start!
- Hop in with us.

64
00:06:57,831 --> 00:07:00,458
- I can't just leave it here!
- I could fix it for you.

65
00:07:00,634 --> 00:07:03,727
- Reid, don't.
- It's not over yet, boys.

66
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,767
Let it go. It's his life, man.

67
00:07:19,923 --> 00:07:21,117
Try it again.

68
00:07:25,296 --> 00:07:26,456
Thank you!

69
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:31,900
- Gotta bolt. Move over.
- It's my car.

70
00:07:32,071 --> 00:07:33,936
Move over, baby boy. Now!

71
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,142
No sweat.

72
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,789
We gotta pull over.

73
00:07:55,965 --> 00:07:57,763
You wanna stop?
That'll impress Harvard.

74
00:07:59,404 --> 00:08:01,235
All right, what the hell?
Let's lose them.

75
00:08:01,405 --> 00:08:03,840
Cut across Marblehead.
We might as well have some fun.

76
00:08:11,017 --> 00:08:12,416
Lose them!

77
00:08:26,036 --> 00:08:28,528
- Step on it. Go!
- Stupid kids.

78
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,600
All right, guys, you ready?

79
00:08:57,772 --> 00:09:00,297
Come on, Caleb.
It's gonna take all of us.

80
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:05,204
Hey, they don't know.
Hit the horn. Hit the horn!

81
00:09:11,688 --> 00:09:16,218
- Holy shit, they're going over.
- Harry Potter can kiss my ass!

82
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,898
Stop the car! Stop the car!

83
00:10:11,393 --> 00:10:13,123
Son of a bitch.

84
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,060
We must be the last ones in.

85
00:10:23,574 --> 00:10:25,599
Well, this is us.

86
00:10:30,315 --> 00:10:32,443
- Just a sec.
- Oh, my God!

87
00:10:32,618 --> 00:10:36,077
- Hate those things.
- And they're all over the place here.

88
00:10:36,255 --> 00:10:37,553
Thank you.

89
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:39,955
See? Chivalry's not dead after all.

90
00:10:40,128 --> 00:10:41,857
No, it just transferred in.

91
00:10:42,464 --> 00:10:44,660
We're gonna go into town
tomorrow for some things.

92
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,132
- Do you need to pick up any stuff?
- Sure.

93
00:10:47,303 --> 00:10:49,533
I'm in 311. Call me.

94
00:10:50,873 --> 00:10:52,204
Okay.

95
00:10:57,214 --> 00:11:00,310
- He's hot, huh?
- Listen to you.

96
00:11:01,353 --> 00:11:03,753
- Thanks for the ride.
- All right. Take it easy.

97
00:11:03,922 --> 00:11:06,948
- I'll see you later, man.
- Call me in the morning.

98
00:11:28,851 --> 00:11:30,876
You're home early.

99
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,925
It's after midnight, Mother.
What are you still doing up?

100
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:48,806
Thinking about my baby
turning 18 this week.

101
00:11:50,945 --> 00:11:55,906
God. You look so much
like him in this light.

102
00:11:58,487 --> 00:12:01,856
You know, he was a year younger
than you when we met.

103
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:04,255
Did I ever tell you that?

104
00:12:04,428 --> 00:12:07,592
Yeah. You've told me.

105
00:12:08,098 --> 00:12:09,565
Now, let's get you up to bed.

106
00:12:10,835 --> 00:12:12,826
So handsome.

107
00:12:15,808 --> 00:12:18,369
He was the most beautiful man
I'd ever seen.

108
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,147
I'm so afraid I'll lose you
like I did him.

109
00:12:25,653 --> 00:12:28,053
How many times do I need to tell you
that I'm not him?

110
00:12:28,223 --> 00:12:31,681
That's the same thing
he said about his father.

111
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:37,296
You know, these powers...

112
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,301
...that you and your friends developed
when you were 13...

113
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:45,339
...are nothing compared with
what you'll get when you ascend.

114
00:12:45,508 --> 00:12:48,343
They are 1000 times stronger.

115
00:12:49,147 --> 00:12:50,979
Caleb.

116
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:55,681
They are so seductive.

117
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,493
You'll suddenly think...

118
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:06,796
...the world is yours for the taking.

119
00:13:07,802 --> 00:13:12,365
And then you really start to use...

120
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,668
...and use...

121
00:13:14,843 --> 00:13:16,403
...aging each time.

122
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:19,913
Taking bits of your life...

123
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:25,354
...until there is nothing left.
- I won't.

124
00:13:26,691 --> 00:13:28,717
That's what he said.

125
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,591
I can't lose you both.

126
00:13:36,604 --> 00:13:38,731
I won't survive it this time.

127
00:13:42,344 --> 00:13:43,903
I won't.

128
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:04,694
So why do you call them
"the Sons of Ipswich"?

129
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,167
What are they? Like, a boy band?

130
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:09,274
You know what? I like you.
You're funny.

131
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:11,673
Not like all the other
stuck-up bitches.

132
00:14:12,212 --> 00:14:14,612
No. They're supposedly descendants
of five families...

133
00:14:14,781 --> 00:14:17,272
...that settled the Ipswich Colony
in the 1600s.

134
00:14:17,451 --> 00:14:18,715
Old money.

135
00:14:22,057 --> 00:14:24,389
Caleb and Reid were both
checking you out tonight.

136
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,118
If it were me, I'd go for Caleb.

137
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:27,896
Why?

138
00:14:28,064 --> 00:14:30,090
He's just one of those
majorly good guys.

139
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:32,132
Well, how do you mean?

140
00:14:32,303 --> 00:14:34,738
He could stay here
and party with the rest of us...

141
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,435
...but he stays at home
to take care of his mom.

142
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:39,201
What's wrong with her?

143
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,905
After Caleb's dad died,
she became a bit of an alcoholic.

144
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,410
So is he seeing anyone?

145
00:14:44,752 --> 00:14:46,116
So we are interested.

146
00:14:50,158 --> 00:14:52,625
- So who's the fifth?
- Fifth what?

147
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:55,058
Well, you said five families.

148
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:57,763
They say the fifth was killed
during the witch-hunt.

149
00:14:57,932 --> 00:15:00,595
- What?
- Cool, huh?

150
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,767
Or creepy.

151
00:15:10,482 --> 00:15:13,043
Couldn't see nothing but their taillights
in the damn fog.

152
00:15:13,218 --> 00:15:14,378
But I swear to God...

153
00:15:14,554 --> 00:15:17,386
...it sure seemed like
they went right off the damn cliffs.

154
00:15:19,726 --> 00:15:21,354
What you were
probably looking at...

155
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:24,987
...were the aircraft warning lights
on the Marblehead lighthouse.

156
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:28,603
<i>Captain, we have a suspect vehicle
with occupant back near the Dells.</i>

157
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,864
<i>Respond and advise.</i>

158
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:47,484
We tried to wake him,
but he's passed out cold.

159
00:15:47,659 --> 00:15:48,786
Doors are all locked.

160
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,487
Go ahead and call it in.
We're gonna need a tow.

161
00:15:53,332 --> 00:15:54,960
Hey, kid!

162
00:15:56,068 --> 00:15:57,195
Open up!

163
00:15:57,838 --> 00:15:59,237
Give me your flashlight.

164
00:16:04,445 --> 00:16:06,037
Break out the rear window.

165
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,526
Son.

166
00:17:03,882 --> 00:17:05,543
Somebody there?

167
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,836
Hello?

168
00:17:33,785 --> 00:17:35,514
Hello?

169
00:19:26,652 --> 00:19:28,813
- Oh, my God.
- Didn't mean to scare you.

170
00:19:28,988 --> 00:19:30,579
- Oh, my God.
- Just got back.

171
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:34,123
Sorry. I'm just a little freaked out.

172
00:19:34,296 --> 00:19:36,593
It felt like someone was watching me
in the showers.

173
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,260
Let's take a look, shall we?

174
00:19:44,742 --> 00:19:45,934
It's okay.

175
00:19:57,222 --> 00:19:59,087
Don't see anyone.

176
00:20:03,663 --> 00:20:07,099
- I'll catch you later, then.
- Yeah, see you.

177
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:47,210
<i>- What makes you think it was Reid?
- It's always him.</i>

178
00:20:47,382 --> 00:20:49,977
I've never felt it when one of us
used The Power. Have you?

179
00:20:50,151 --> 00:20:53,451
No. I don't know, maybe it's because
you're so close to ascending.

180
00:20:53,622 --> 00:20:56,592
I don't know. Maybe.

181
00:20:56,893 --> 00:21:00,661
I'm telling you, it was strong enough
to wake me out of a dead sleep.

182
00:21:00,932 --> 00:21:02,957
He's only using his powers
to piss you off...

183
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:05,728
...because he's jealous
you're ascending first, man.

184
00:21:06,204 --> 00:21:08,764
I'm telling you, just... Jesus!

185
00:21:09,707 --> 00:21:10,869
<i>Caleb?</i>

186
00:21:27,295 --> 00:21:29,195
<i>What's going on, Caleb? Pick up.</i>

187
00:21:29,365 --> 00:21:32,094
<i>Caleb, pick up the phone, man.</i>

188
00:21:32,635 --> 00:21:34,103
Caleb, what's going on?

189
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,437
I just saw a darkling.

190
00:21:37,608 --> 00:21:40,269
It was in the form of that dead kid
they found at the Dells.

191
00:21:40,444 --> 00:21:42,573
I saw his picture this morning
in the newspaper.

192
00:21:42,748 --> 00:21:45,739
<i>- But who'd send you a darkling?
- I have no idea.</i>

193
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,979
<i>Something's wrong. I can feel it.</i>

194
00:21:48,155 --> 00:21:49,712
We gotta talk to Reid tonight.

195
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,187
<i>He'll probably be at Nicky's.</i>

196
00:21:51,358 --> 00:21:52,825
<i>- We'll see him then.
- Definitely.</i>

197
00:22:19,157 --> 00:22:20,818
- Here you go, Caleb.
- Thanks.

198
00:22:20,991 --> 00:22:22,620
Hey, Caleb.

199
00:22:22,794 --> 00:22:26,197
- Oh, hey, Kate. What are you up to?
- I'm just stocking up our room.

200
00:22:26,867 --> 00:22:30,359
- Did you hear about the dead kid?
- Yeah, I did.

201
00:22:31,071 --> 00:22:32,333
Did you know him?

202
00:22:33,073 --> 00:22:35,839
No. No, he just transferred in.

203
00:22:36,011 --> 00:22:38,206
Yeah, I heard he lived on
Reid and Tyler's floor.

204
00:22:40,249 --> 00:22:42,616
- Hi.
- Hi there.

205
00:22:45,788 --> 00:22:47,450
You scared me.

206
00:22:47,624 --> 00:22:49,525
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

207
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,455
I'm gonna see if Pogue wants to catch
that new Brad Pitt flick this afternoon.

208
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,895
- Who else wants to go?
- I will.

209
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:59,330
I gotta run some errands
for my mother.

210
00:22:59,571 --> 00:23:00,663
I already saw it.

211
00:23:02,374 --> 00:23:04,901
- Do you feel like running errands?
- Sure.

212
00:23:28,639 --> 00:23:31,939
I wish I'd brought my camera.
This place is so beautiful.

213
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,311
That's the old Putnam barn.
What's left of it.

214
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,617
This whole place, for miles around,
was the original Ipswich Colony.

215
00:23:50,398 --> 00:23:52,867
- So, what brought you to Spenser?
- A scholarship.

216
00:23:53,035 --> 00:23:55,937
- But why Spenser?
- I want to go to Harvard.

217
00:23:56,105 --> 00:23:59,235
- My father was class of '81.
- That's so cool.

218
00:24:01,111 --> 00:24:05,072
- Kate told me he passed away.
- You and Kate talk about me?

219
00:24:05,885 --> 00:24:08,444
Well, you know, just girl stuff.

220
00:24:33,818 --> 00:24:36,548
It's our family's first colony house.

221
00:24:38,721 --> 00:24:43,252
- Wait. Somebody lives here?
- Just our caretaker, Gorman.

222
00:24:45,264 --> 00:24:47,164
Gorman! It's me! It's okay!

223
00:24:47,633 --> 00:24:50,101
- He doesn't see that well anymore.
- You think?

224
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:54,506
- Who's with you?
- Just a friend.

225
00:24:54,675 --> 00:24:57,337
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

226
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,449
Caleb.

227
00:25:37,526 --> 00:25:40,690
- You should be more careful.
- I know, Gorman.

228
00:25:42,931 --> 00:25:46,096
- Is there anything else he needs?
- No.

229
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,328
I'll see you next week, then.

230
00:26:06,726 --> 00:26:10,061
- Okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

231
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:13,033
So you wanna shower
or change first?

232
00:26:13,202 --> 00:26:16,605
- For what?
- We're going to Nicky's.

233
00:26:17,473 --> 00:26:18,701
What's Nicky's?

234
00:26:23,113 --> 00:26:25,444
Hey. How are you?

235
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:46,100
Oh, hey, baby!
You missed a great movie.

236
00:26:46,273 --> 00:26:47,832
Yeah, I had to get my bike fixed.

237
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:50,307
That's cool. Chase hung out
and kept me company.

238
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:53,012
I'll just bet he did.

239
00:26:55,453 --> 00:26:57,614
- What's up, man?
- It's all good.

240
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:01,520
You want something to eat?

241
00:27:02,227 --> 00:27:04,161
I'll just pick at
whatever you're having.

242
00:27:13,106 --> 00:27:15,506
Can I get a burger, fries and a Coke?

243
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:18,200
- Corner pocket.
- Great shot.

244
00:27:23,585 --> 00:27:26,213
Well, well, well...

245
00:27:26,389 --> 00:27:28,380
- How long you guys been here?
- A bit.

246
00:27:28,556 --> 00:27:33,154
Just been playing Aaron and Bordy,
and... Would you look at that?

247
00:27:36,433 --> 00:27:39,996
- Blue, cotton.
- Pink, lace.

248
00:27:40,172 --> 00:27:43,539
Boys, that girl hasn't worn panties
since she was 12.

249
00:27:50,985 --> 00:27:53,511
Yeah. Thanks, boys.

250
00:27:57,358 --> 00:27:59,156
Keep the change.

251
00:27:59,828 --> 00:28:01,626
Next time.

252
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:15,742
You guys are real tight, huh?

253
00:28:16,246 --> 00:28:18,578
Families are real close.
We kind of grew up together.

254
00:28:19,651 --> 00:28:22,916
- We're kind of like brothers.
- That must have been nice.

255
00:28:26,093 --> 00:28:28,152
- The best two out of three.
- Okay.

256
00:28:28,329 --> 00:28:31,354
Hey, Chase.
Mind if I get in a game?

257
00:28:31,533 --> 00:28:33,728
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

258
00:28:35,738 --> 00:28:37,932
Reid and Tyler are here.

259
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:41,037
- Where?
- Pool tables. With Aaron and the boys.

260
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:45,412
Great. That's trouble.

261
00:28:45,581 --> 00:28:47,915
So Caleb tells me
you guys are swimmers.

262
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,583
Spenser's best. State finals twice.

263
00:28:52,056 --> 00:28:55,620
I swam for Hastings.
I was their freestyle man.

264
00:28:56,194 --> 00:28:58,925
You won't be here.
That's Caleb's swim.

265
00:29:02,668 --> 00:29:05,832
- Okay, what just happened?
- What?

266
00:29:06,005 --> 00:29:07,941
We were sitting here together,
having fun...

267
00:29:08,109 --> 00:29:09,838
...and now we're
watching them have fun.

268
00:29:10,346 --> 00:29:12,941
That's what girls do.
You know boys and their toys.

269
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,284
- Give me a quarter.
- Why?

270
00:29:16,452 --> 00:29:18,853
Just give me a quarter.
I'll show you what girls do.

271
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,323
Thank you.

272
00:29:48,523 --> 00:29:51,391
Gentlemen, it was a pleasure.

273
00:30:23,498 --> 00:30:24,966
What?

274
00:30:31,675 --> 00:30:34,405
- Blow me!
- Let's take it outside. Come on.

275
00:30:34,578 --> 00:30:37,776
Hey, it's Reid and Tyler.
Grab my jacket.

276
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,110
- You guys need help?
- Just stay with the girls.

277
00:30:41,754 --> 00:30:42,915
Get him, Reid!

278
00:30:43,322 --> 00:30:45,381
Let's go. Bring it on, man.

279
00:30:46,126 --> 00:30:49,152
He made the shot, dickhead.
You bet him he couldn't and he did.

280
00:30:49,328 --> 00:30:51,763
We ain't paying you shit,
so if you don't like it...

281
00:30:51,932 --> 00:30:53,093
What's the problem?

282
00:30:53,267 --> 00:30:57,102
He bet me I couldn't
make a combo shot, and I did.

283
00:30:57,404 --> 00:31:01,775
- Everyone just forget about it, okay?
- Hey! Take it someplace else, ladies.

284
00:31:04,548 --> 00:31:08,245
- Now.
- Whatever you say, Nicky.

285
00:31:16,527 --> 00:31:19,123
- What were you thinking?
- We were just playing them.

286
00:31:19,298 --> 00:31:21,733
Yeah, come on, Caleb.
They were suckers for it.

287
00:31:21,901 --> 00:31:24,427
Why don't you quit
being such a pussy?

288
00:31:24,604 --> 00:31:26,128
I'm not finished with you yet.

289
00:31:33,181 --> 00:31:35,241
Reid, stop.

290
00:31:41,324 --> 00:31:43,850
What will it take for you to get it?

291
00:31:44,026 --> 00:31:45,654
It's addictive, you moron!

292
00:31:46,964 --> 00:31:48,864
You've seen what it can do
if you abuse it.

293
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,001
You want that? That's your business.

294
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:56,301
But if you use in the open, like you
did tonight, you risk exposing us all.

295
00:31:56,475 --> 00:31:58,467
And that I won't let happen.

296
00:32:01,147 --> 00:32:04,174
- My power's greater than yours.
- Not until you ascend.

297
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,842
All right, go for it, tough guy.

298
00:32:17,801 --> 00:32:20,270
- Stop it! This is crazy.
- It's for his own good!

299
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,963
Keep using like you did tonight
and last night...

300
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:24,698
...you'll be as good as dead.

301
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,845
So I fixed her car. Big deal!

302
00:32:27,013 --> 00:32:29,607
Don't play me, Reid!
I'm talking later and you know it.

303
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:31,909
The hell I do!

304
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:35,652
I didn't use later.

305
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,628
It's not right
using on each other, Caleb.

306
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:43,319
Tell it to Reid.

307
00:32:51,475 --> 00:32:55,308
Reid's lying.
It had to have been him.

308
00:32:55,512 --> 00:32:57,241
How do you know?

309
00:32:58,382 --> 00:33:02,286
Because it wasn't you. Tyler doesn't
have the balls to lie to me.

310
00:33:02,453 --> 00:33:05,583
- Hey.
- Hey.

311
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:08,958
- You okay?
- Yeah.

312
00:33:10,229 --> 00:33:13,688
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Let's go.

313
00:33:14,436 --> 00:33:18,236
Yeah, let's get out of here.

314
00:33:30,853 --> 00:33:33,755
Thanks again for a great day.
I had fun.

315
00:33:34,692 --> 00:33:36,660
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

316
00:33:37,696 --> 00:33:39,426
Listen, I'm sorry about Gorman.

317
00:33:39,598 --> 00:33:42,066
He's just not used
to seeing me with anyone.

318
00:33:43,267 --> 00:33:44,566
I think I'll survive.

319
00:33:49,008 --> 00:33:54,003
Fact is, you're the only girl
I've ever taken out there.

320
00:33:54,816 --> 00:33:57,580
- Really?
- Yeah.

321
00:33:58,386 --> 00:34:03,154
- And why is that?
- I'm not sure just yet.

322
00:34:07,064 --> 00:34:09,158
- Good night.
- Good night.

323
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:22,984
Kate, wake up! Kate, wake up!

324
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,289
Yeah.

325
00:36:58,467 --> 00:37:02,063
<i>I just saw the same darkling you saw
last night. That dead kid at the Dells.</i>

326
00:37:02,571 --> 00:37:03,765
What the hell is it?

327
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,966
<i>I don't know.
It's starting to freak me out.</i>

328
00:37:07,945 --> 00:37:10,072
I'm telling you,
someone's using powers...

329
00:37:10,247 --> 00:37:12,010
...and I mean bigtime.

330
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:14,915
<i>And I intend to find out who.</i>

331
00:37:55,834 --> 00:37:58,133
- Hey.
- Hi.

332
00:38:06,982 --> 00:38:08,449
Good morning.

333
00:38:09,683 --> 00:38:11,381
Mr. Danvers...

334
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:14,820
...Provost Higgins requests the
pleasure of your company after class.

335
00:38:16,993 --> 00:38:20,658
We're going to study four American
contemporary writers of fiction.

336
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:26,493
First is Cormac McCarthy,
then Tim O'Brien...

337
00:38:26,672 --> 00:38:31,336
...Kent Haruf,
and last but not least...

338
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:37,316
<i>...Stephen King.
- Yeah! Dreamcatcher was the shit!</i>

339
00:38:41,257 --> 00:38:45,023
<i>Thank you, Mr. Garwin, but no.
My choice is The Shining.</i>

340
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:51,660
This is not the kind of publicity
this institution is interested in.

341
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:54,866
You wouldn't know anything about it,
would you, Mr. Danvers?

342
00:38:55,038 --> 00:38:56,268
No, sir.

343
00:38:56,441 --> 00:38:59,467
But you would know about a fight
at a local bar last night.

344
00:39:00,846 --> 00:39:02,644
- Sir, if I could...
- And if I'm correct...

345
00:39:03,715 --> 00:39:05,479
...Chase Collins was with you?

346
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,583
Yes, sir.

347
00:39:14,129 --> 00:39:17,462
Chase Collins comes to us
with a brilliant academic record...

348
00:39:17,632 --> 00:39:21,033
...and his family trust has made
a generous endowment...

349
00:39:21,203 --> 00:39:23,364
...to this institution.

350
00:39:23,539 --> 00:39:26,475
I want to make sure he has
a positive experience at Spenser.

351
00:39:27,077 --> 00:39:30,138
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yes, sir.

352
00:39:30,549 --> 00:39:32,072
Good.

353
00:39:35,788 --> 00:39:38,255
I understand you and Chase
have already bonded...

354
00:39:38,423 --> 00:39:41,018
...and I would appreciate it
if you would continue...

355
00:39:41,194 --> 00:39:45,188
...to take him under your wing, make
sure his stay here is a pleasant one.

356
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,365
- And, Caleb.
- Sir?

357
00:39:51,206 --> 00:39:53,003
No more fights.

358
00:39:54,709 --> 00:39:56,199
Yes, sir.

359
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:24,913
What is that?

360
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,552
Caleb's family history.

361
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:32,654
Did you know that the witchcraft thing
started here in Ipswich?

362
00:41:33,894 --> 00:41:37,660
Every time I ask Pogue about it,
he just tells me it's all nonsense.

363
00:42:02,294 --> 00:42:04,559
So, what did the provost want?

364
00:42:07,467 --> 00:42:10,130
Someone told him about
the fight at Nicky's.

365
00:42:11,939 --> 00:42:14,237
Feel like elaborating on that?

366
00:42:15,845 --> 00:42:18,870
You got a piece of glass in your face.
Hold on.

367
00:42:30,829 --> 00:42:32,854
- Say my name!
- Grow up, dude.

368
00:42:37,237 --> 00:42:39,171
What are you looking at, fag?

369
00:42:40,206 --> 00:42:41,765
That thing between your legs.

370
00:42:41,942 --> 00:42:45,343
It's like a penis, only smaller.

371
00:42:50,184 --> 00:42:52,278
Hey, let him go, Aaron!

372
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,757
Don't be so sensitive, Aaron.

373
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:03,092
Size isn't everything.

374
00:43:04,934 --> 00:43:06,197
My man.

375
00:43:07,538 --> 00:43:09,804
Up for some foosball?

376
00:43:09,975 --> 00:43:12,911
I have dinner with Sarah,
but I think I can hang out for a while.

377
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:17,210
- What about you?
- No, man. I'm cool.

378
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:36,029
You're being ridiculous!
What is your problem?

379
00:43:36,205 --> 00:43:38,197
- Chase is my problem.
- What, are you jealous?

380
00:43:38,375 --> 00:43:41,345
- I don't want you hanging around him.
- Look, he is just a friend.

381
00:43:41,511 --> 00:43:44,879
Yeah, right. I'm sure he's interested
in just being friends.

382
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:47,484
This is beyond idiotic.

383
00:44:00,536 --> 00:44:02,401
Thanks for dinner.

384
00:44:03,072 --> 00:44:05,506
- How about Saturday?
- What about Saturday?

385
00:44:05,842 --> 00:44:09,779
- It's the Fall Fest.
- Oh, Fall Fest.

386
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:12,176
Just wondering if
you wanted to go with me.

387
00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:16,650
And, also,
it happens to be my birthday.

388
00:44:19,024 --> 00:44:20,683
I don't know.

389
00:44:23,596 --> 00:44:24,995
I'd love to go with you.

390
00:44:37,511 --> 00:44:40,415
- I should go.
- Yeah. Yeah, you should.

391
00:44:43,052 --> 00:44:48,081
- No. I mean, back to the dorms.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

392
00:44:54,232 --> 00:44:56,167
I'm really gonna go.

393
00:44:57,837 --> 00:44:59,361
This is me leaving.

394
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,711
- Good night.
- Good night.

395
00:45:08,881 --> 00:45:10,110
Sleep tight.

396
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:24,568
<i>I hate him when he's like this.</i>

397
00:45:25,037 --> 00:45:27,766
He's been jealous since the day
we met. It drives me crazy.

398
00:45:27,939 --> 00:45:31,171
You don't hate Pogue.
You guys are perfect for each other.

399
00:45:33,012 --> 00:45:34,239
Maybe not.

400
00:45:34,414 --> 00:45:36,279
Maybe it's time
to check out something new.

401
00:45:37,884 --> 00:45:40,411
And maybe that's what
Pogue's picking up on.

402
00:45:46,027 --> 00:45:48,791
- This is the eighth time he's called.
- So talk to him.

403
00:45:49,732 --> 00:45:51,961
No. Not until he stops
being an idiot.

404
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,676
I'll bet Caleb's not the jealous type.

405
00:46:47,198 --> 00:46:48,461
Go for it!

406
00:46:49,735 --> 00:46:50,997
Come on, man!

407
00:47:04,053 --> 00:47:05,816
Come on, Pogue!

408
00:47:11,729 --> 00:47:14,060
- He really is good.
- He's the best.

409
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:18,258
I hear you swim a mean freestyle.

410
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,872
- That's what they tell me.
- Let's see what you got.

411
00:47:30,951 --> 00:47:31,939
Let's go!

412
00:47:35,957 --> 00:47:37,084
Push off! Let's go!

413
00:48:11,866 --> 00:48:12,992
You okay, man?

414
00:48:13,868 --> 00:48:17,394
There you are.
Had us going there for a second.

415
00:48:21,245 --> 00:48:22,678
Whacked your head pretty good.

416
00:48:23,548 --> 00:48:25,675
Lucky for you, Chase was there
to get you out...

417
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:27,751
...before you sucked up the pool.

418
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,354
<i>He also whipped your ass.</i>

419
00:48:31,123 --> 00:48:33,524
It became apparent
that the view of civil liberties...

420
00:48:33,692 --> 00:48:36,924
...needing no special protection
was not widely shared.

421
00:48:38,331 --> 00:48:41,596
Come in. Thank you.

422
00:48:41,768 --> 00:48:44,363
Twelve amendments were suggested,
10 eventually ratified.

423
00:48:44,538 --> 00:48:46,767
Called the what, Ms. Snider?

424
00:48:47,643 --> 00:48:50,373
- The Bill of Rights.
- Right you are.

425
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:56,313
Arguably, the first being the most
important. Read it for us, Mr. Simms.

426
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:03,321
Mr. Collins, you're wanted
in the provost's office.

427
00:49:07,933 --> 00:49:10,424
Mr. Simms.

428
00:49:10,603 --> 00:49:11,934
"Congress shall make no law...

429
00:49:12,105 --> 00:49:14,233
...respecting an establishment
of religion...

430
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:16,569
...or prohibiting
the free exercise thereof...

431
00:49:17,344 --> 00:49:20,508
...or abridging the freedom of speech,
or of the press...

432
00:49:20,683 --> 00:49:23,311
...or the right of the people
peaceably to assemble..."

433
00:49:26,121 --> 00:49:29,579
- Provost Higgins. You wanted to...?
- Chase, come in.

434
00:49:36,866 --> 00:49:38,858
You know one of our students
lost his life...

435
00:49:39,036 --> 00:49:40,696
...a few nights back at the Dells.

436
00:49:41,938 --> 00:49:43,168
Yes, I heard.

437
00:49:45,177 --> 00:49:48,908
- Did you know him?
- No, sir. Why?

438
00:49:50,582 --> 00:49:52,711
His car was returned to his parents.

439
00:49:54,021 --> 00:49:56,286
His mother was kind enough
to send this back to us.

440
00:50:00,896 --> 00:50:05,596
- My student ID. I lost it that night.
- It was in the back seat.

441
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:09,472
That's odd. I wonder how he got it.

442
00:50:10,241 --> 00:50:12,707
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.

443
00:50:13,778 --> 00:50:16,873
I understand you've become close
with Caleb and his friends.

444
00:50:17,048 --> 00:50:19,142
Yeah. They're great guys, sir.

445
00:50:19,585 --> 00:50:22,281
I agree. You couldn't have
picked a better bunch.

446
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:26,089
I think so too.

447
00:50:31,564 --> 00:50:34,159
<i>- Am I gonna see you tonight?
- I hope so.</i>

448
00:50:34,334 --> 00:50:37,636
Listen, I have something to do first.
I'll give you a call later, okay?

449
00:50:37,807 --> 00:50:40,298
- I'll be in my room.
- Okay.

450
00:50:41,177 --> 00:50:43,577
What'd she say about Kate?
Why won't she call me back?

451
00:50:43,746 --> 00:50:45,612
She's still pissed at you.

452
00:50:45,949 --> 00:50:48,475
- Why are we doing this?
- I saw the darkling again.

453
00:50:48,652 --> 00:50:50,712
Yeah, but why break into
the admissions office?

454
00:50:50,889 --> 00:50:53,723
Because I wanna know more
about Chase Collins.

455
00:50:55,461 --> 00:50:59,796
Look, I don't even like the guy.

456
00:50:59,965 --> 00:51:01,900
Are you sure you're not
just imagining this?

457
00:51:02,069 --> 00:51:05,196
I'm telling you, his eyes were
as black as night in the pool today.

458
00:51:05,639 --> 00:51:07,165
All right.

459
00:51:41,048 --> 00:51:42,675
Well, how sick is she?

460
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,445
She came in complaining
of chills and a headache.

461
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:48,612
<i>Within an hour, she had
a 101-degree temperature.</i>

462
00:51:48,791 --> 00:51:52,022
- What could it be?
- The doctor's checking her now.

463
00:51:52,194 --> 00:51:55,925
<i>- We'll call you when we know more.
- It's okay. I'm coming over there.</i>

464
00:52:08,848 --> 00:52:10,406
They died in a car accident.

465
00:52:11,518 --> 00:52:13,577
It says Chase's father
just lost control.

466
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:18,089
His real name was Pope.

467
00:52:18,259 --> 00:52:22,628
Chase Goodwin Pope.
Born July 14th, 1988.

468
00:52:22,797 --> 00:52:25,129
The Collins adopted him
after his mother died...

469
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,564
...when he was 2 years old.

470
00:52:29,037 --> 00:52:32,702
- When did you say his birthday was?
- July 14th.

471
00:52:35,612 --> 00:52:37,910
That's the same day
his adoptive parents died.

472
00:52:39,284 --> 00:52:42,310
- What year was he born?
- 1988.

473
00:52:45,925 --> 00:52:48,452
They died on his 18th birthday.

474
00:53:47,299 --> 00:53:50,291
Why are you taking her to the hospital
at Gloucester?

475
00:53:50,469 --> 00:53:52,528
Her temperature's jumped to 105...

476
00:53:52,704 --> 00:53:55,502
...and she's showing symptoms
of anaphylactic shock.

477
00:53:55,674 --> 00:54:00,271
- What does that mean?
- It's a severe allergic reaction.

478
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:03,643
- To what?
- We're not sure.

479
00:54:04,218 --> 00:54:06,709
It's as if she'd been bitten
by hundreds of insects.

480
00:54:07,855 --> 00:54:09,721
Like spiders.

481
00:54:22,305 --> 00:54:25,071
Goodwin Pope. Goodwin Pope.

482
00:54:25,244 --> 00:54:27,109
Goodwin, Goodwin. Goodwin Pope.

483
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,871
Agnes Goodwin Pope.

484
00:54:29,048 --> 00:54:31,880
- That's where I've heard it before.
- What are you talking about?

485
00:54:32,051 --> 00:54:34,520
<i>The Book of Damnation.
They used to call her Goody Pope.</i>

486
00:54:34,689 --> 00:54:35,814
Do you remember her?

487
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:39,015
I haven't read the Book
since we were kids.

488
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:42,022
Just call Reid and Tyler.

489
00:55:16,269 --> 00:55:17,294
I told them everything.

490
00:55:17,472 --> 00:55:20,498
About the darkling,
what we found in his file...

491
00:55:44,102 --> 00:55:45,900
It's a list of names...

492
00:55:46,072 --> 00:55:48,736
...who brought charges against
John Putnam and his family...

493
00:55:48,909 --> 00:55:51,742
...during the Salem hunt.
Pope was one of them.

494
00:55:52,147 --> 00:55:53,977
Goody Pope.

495
00:55:55,149 --> 00:55:56,914
Widow of Jacob, mother to Hagen.

496
00:55:57,085 --> 00:55:58,451
So what?

497
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:03,184
So she claims that John Putnam came
to her as an incubus in her dreams...

498
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:06,286
...after she was widowed.

499
00:56:06,462 --> 00:56:09,956
The Book also records births
and deaths during the damnation.

500
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:15,371
Goody Pope's husband, Jacob,
died June fourth, 1692.

501
00:56:15,807 --> 00:56:20,405
Her son, Hagen,
was born April 11th, 1693.

502
00:56:22,948 --> 00:56:24,974
That's 10 months and 24 days later.

503
00:56:33,429 --> 00:56:34,862
If what you're saying is true...

504
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:38,091
...and Hagen Pope is the bastard son
of John Putnam...

505
00:56:38,267 --> 00:56:41,634
...then the fifth bloodline
in the Covenant didn't end in Salem.

506
00:56:44,908 --> 00:56:48,572
- And Chase is one of us.
- That's crazy.

507
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,746
He can't be.

508
00:56:50,916 --> 00:56:53,214
The night after the party
at the Dells...

509
00:56:53,385 --> 00:56:55,444
...someone was using.

510
00:56:55,754 --> 00:56:57,745
The Power was strong enough
to wake me.

511
00:56:57,924 --> 00:56:59,720
The next night, it happened again.

512
00:56:59,894 --> 00:57:01,724
- I felt it then.
- See? I told you.

513
00:57:01,895 --> 00:57:03,123
I felt it too.

514
00:57:04,065 --> 00:57:06,727
When you said it wasn't you,
were you lying?

515
00:57:07,502 --> 00:57:09,265
No.

516
00:57:09,938 --> 00:57:13,772
- You swear?
- I swear.

517
00:57:19,717 --> 00:57:21,082
Then it was him.

518
00:57:29,094 --> 00:57:32,792
<i>- Hey, could I call you...?
- Caleb, Kate's been attacked.</i>

519
00:57:32,965 --> 00:57:34,125
Wait, wait. What?

520
00:57:34,299 --> 00:57:37,099
They say it's like
she's been bitten by spiders...

521
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:40,470
...and I had this terrible nightmare
about spiders.

522
00:57:41,642 --> 00:57:45,079
I'm scared, Caleb.
Something weird is happening.

523
00:57:45,246 --> 00:57:47,875
Okay, listen.
I want you to go back to your dorm...

524
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:49,950
...and wait for me there.

525
00:57:50,118 --> 00:57:52,986
- I'll see you soon, okay?
- Okay.

526
00:57:59,132 --> 00:58:01,497
He's put a spell on Kate.

527
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,859
What are you talking about?
What kind of spell?

528
00:58:04,237 --> 00:58:05,636
Creation.

529
00:58:07,241 --> 00:58:08,731
Spiders.

530
00:58:08,908 --> 00:58:11,275
They're taking her to a hospital
in Gloucester.

531
00:58:11,444 --> 00:58:13,846
Don't do anything
until we know what he wants.

532
00:58:14,015 --> 00:58:15,209
We're talking about Kate!

533
00:58:48,888 --> 00:58:52,519
Come to save Little Miss Muffet,
have we?

534
00:58:54,096 --> 00:58:55,529
Well, you're too late.

535
00:58:57,466 --> 00:58:59,196
A spider came
and sat down beside her...

536
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,201
...and frightened Miss Muffet away.

537
00:59:28,936 --> 00:59:30,928
You hurt Kate, and I'll kill you.

538
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,204
Hurt her?

539
00:59:34,343 --> 00:59:35,970
I only used her to get to you.

540
00:59:37,647 --> 00:59:41,175
It's you that I'm gonna hurt.

541
00:59:44,121 --> 00:59:47,057
And you're just my bait
to get to Caleb.

542
00:59:56,569 --> 00:59:58,730
These are her things.

543
00:59:59,874 --> 01:00:02,570
Why don't you go back to the dorm
and get some sleep?

544
01:00:02,744 --> 01:00:05,838
If I hear anything, I'll call you.

545
01:01:00,879 --> 01:01:02,472
Hey.

546
01:01:06,886 --> 01:01:08,650
What's wrong?

547
01:01:11,792 --> 01:01:13,453
Have you seen Pogue?

548
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:17,030
No, but I called him
and told him about Kate.

549
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,535
Well, how is she?

550
01:01:25,708 --> 01:01:29,735
Not so good. But they said they'd call
if there are any changes.

551
01:01:35,854 --> 01:01:37,845
Maybe this is him.

552
01:01:39,491 --> 01:01:41,689
Pogue's been in an accident.

553
01:01:52,775 --> 01:01:54,367
Stop right there.

554
01:01:57,313 --> 01:01:58,712
Close the door.

555
01:02:07,357 --> 01:02:11,920
Let's just keep this between
the Sons of Ipswich.

556
01:02:16,902 --> 01:02:20,271
Don't hurt her.
She has nothing to do with this.

557
01:02:20,441 --> 01:02:24,001
Whether she lives or dies
is entirely up to you, my friend.

558
01:02:28,617 --> 01:02:32,645
You can't imagine what it was like
growing up not knowing what this was.

559
01:02:35,993 --> 01:02:41,261
When I finally found my real father,
he filled in all the missing pieces.

560
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:48,499
But it was too late. I was hooked.

561
01:02:49,941 --> 01:02:53,502
By then, he was
such a bitter old man...

562
01:02:53,679 --> 01:02:59,676
Or I should say,
bitter, old, young man.

563
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:04,216
- that all he wanted to do
was end the suffering.

564
01:03:04,558 --> 01:03:06,116
Like all our bloodline before us...

565
01:03:06,295 --> 01:03:08,785
...he was more than willing
to break the laws...

566
01:03:08,964 --> 01:03:12,960
...of your sacred little club.

567
01:03:17,842 --> 01:03:19,901
So I got him to give me
his share of The Power.

568
01:03:26,953 --> 01:03:32,414
And he died knowing that his son
was going to get revenge...

569
01:03:32,592 --> 01:03:34,116
...on your Covenant.

570
01:03:34,295 --> 01:03:36,991
You keep her in that spell,
and she'll die.

571
01:03:37,832 --> 01:03:39,390
I know.

572
01:03:40,336 --> 01:03:43,429
What is this all about?
I mean, what do you want?

573
01:03:44,907 --> 01:03:46,499
Want?

574
01:03:56,388 --> 01:03:57,719
I'm Chase Collins.

575
01:04:00,259 --> 01:04:03,661
I have everything
I could possibly want.

576
01:04:08,669 --> 01:04:10,499
It's what I need.

577
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:15,136
More power.

578
01:04:22,386 --> 01:04:25,014
Tomorrow night, birthday boy...

579
01:04:25,522 --> 01:04:29,983
...at the exact moment
when you ascend...

580
01:04:32,397 --> 01:04:34,957
...be at Putnam Barn...

581
01:04:35,133 --> 01:04:37,897
...where you will
will me your power.

582
01:04:39,638 --> 01:04:43,973
Do that, and I'll let her live.

583
01:04:46,112 --> 01:04:51,575
And Pogue, Kate, Reid and Tyler
and your mom...

584
01:04:52,287 --> 01:04:54,983
...and what's left of the families.

585
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:59,751
And don't think I won't kill them.

586
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:04,531
It comes natural to me.

587
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:09,964
Just ask my adoptive parents.

588
01:05:10,574 --> 01:05:12,806
You killed that kid at the Dells.

589
01:05:16,249 --> 01:05:19,012
Well, he caught me
doing a little magic.

590
01:05:21,021 --> 01:05:25,050
At first, he wasn't sure,
but then, well...

591
01:05:25,227 --> 01:05:27,593
...he just wouldn't leave it alone.

592
01:05:28,430 --> 01:05:31,696
So I caught a ride with him
over to the bonfire.

593
01:05:38,209 --> 01:05:39,334
What are you doing?

594
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:41,478
Just making sure
I'm making my point.

595
01:06:11,648 --> 01:06:14,447
Do you see my problem here?

596
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:22,656
I like to use. A lot.

597
01:06:23,996 --> 01:06:25,657
Only...

598
01:06:25,830 --> 01:06:29,768
...no one ever told me about...

599
01:06:30,104 --> 01:06:34,370
...the effects and the damage.

600
01:06:34,542 --> 01:06:36,442
The addiction.

601
01:06:37,912 --> 01:06:40,313
And we both know
what happens, now, don't we?

602
01:06:41,483 --> 01:06:43,110
So...

603
01:06:44,921 --> 01:06:46,718
...the way I see it...

604
01:06:47,557 --> 01:06:50,152
...I add your power
to what I already have.

605
01:06:50,426 --> 01:06:52,362
It won't stop the aging.

606
01:06:52,530 --> 01:06:56,432
Your father obviously found out
the hard way.

607
01:06:59,172 --> 01:07:01,538
My father never had
this kind of power.

608
01:07:01,708 --> 01:07:04,075
It doesn't work like that.

609
01:07:04,245 --> 01:07:07,271
It's the body that wears down,
not the power.

610
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:15,416
Just think of yourself
as a sacrificial lamb.

611
01:07:19,094 --> 01:07:20,756
Hell...

612
01:07:21,864 --> 01:07:24,662
...you're already their golden boy.

613
01:07:25,602 --> 01:07:28,400
Why not go out a real hero?

614
01:07:29,406 --> 01:07:33,571
So tomorrow night, the barn.

615
01:07:33,744 --> 01:07:35,803
Where it all started.

616
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:40,477
A birthday party. Just you and me.

617
01:07:41,389 --> 01:07:43,583
It's either you...

618
01:07:44,626 --> 01:07:46,389
...or them...

619
01:07:49,497 --> 01:07:51,226
...brother.

620
01:08:01,512 --> 01:08:05,608
Don't leave her like that. She'll die.

621
01:08:28,410 --> 01:08:30,039
What happened?

622
01:08:32,915 --> 01:08:36,079
- You passed out when I told you...
- What?

623
01:08:41,025 --> 01:08:44,552
- Pogue's been in an accident.
- Is he okay?

624
01:09:02,084 --> 01:09:03,948
Hey, hey, take it easy.

625
01:09:08,357 --> 01:09:11,987
- What?
- Stay away.

626
01:09:12,161 --> 01:09:14,824
He's more powerful...

627
01:09:15,432 --> 01:09:17,093
...than you can imagine.

628
01:09:18,036 --> 01:09:20,631
Hey, don't worry.
Don't worry about that.

629
01:09:21,406 --> 01:09:23,603
We can't stop him.

630
01:09:33,955 --> 01:09:36,219
- How is he?
- He's hurt pretty bad.

631
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:38,586
- Where's Sarah?
- Waiting room.

632
01:09:38,762 --> 01:09:42,289
I say we all go after Chase.
Right now.

633
01:09:43,031 --> 01:09:44,828
Listen, it may not be that easy.

634
01:09:47,704 --> 01:09:51,369
You guys stay here with Pogue.
Call me if there's a change.

635
01:10:00,185 --> 01:10:02,087
How's Pogue?

636
01:10:05,057 --> 01:10:06,456
He's not good.

637
01:10:08,061 --> 01:10:10,031
What about Kate?
Have you heard anything?

638
01:10:10,197 --> 01:10:13,565
They stabilized her,
but she's still really sick.

639
01:10:24,882 --> 01:10:29,979
Caleb, look me in the eye
and tell me the truth.

640
01:10:31,389 --> 01:10:32,982
The spiders.

641
01:10:33,157 --> 01:10:37,255
I read about them. They're one
of the charges against John Putnam.

642
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:44,331
They're some kind of spell,
aren't they?

643
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:54,645
I wanna show you something...

644
01:10:55,852 --> 01:10:57,946
...and then I'll explain everything.

645
01:11:23,017 --> 01:11:24,212
Don't be afraid.

646
01:11:53,152 --> 01:11:55,383
What about your caretaker?

647
01:11:58,993 --> 01:12:00,892
It'll be okay.

648
01:12:36,738 --> 01:12:39,229
- What are you doing?
- It's all right.

649
01:12:39,773 --> 01:12:43,176
- Caleb...
- This is important to me, Gorman.

650
01:13:04,238 --> 01:13:05,762
It's okay.

651
01:13:21,759 --> 01:13:26,890
This is William Danvers III,
my father.

652
01:13:30,535 --> 01:13:33,095
He's 44 years old.

653
01:13:52,227 --> 01:13:54,957
Every generation,
the bloodlines produce only one:

654
01:13:55,131 --> 01:13:57,190
The eldest male.

655
01:13:57,368 --> 01:14:00,302
And you've always had this power?

656
01:14:00,971 --> 01:14:04,135
At 13, you get a taste of it.
It's a test, in a way.

657
01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:09,279
At 18, we ascend,
and our powers fully mature...

658
01:14:09,448 --> 01:14:11,917
...and it's seductive.

659
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:18,090
And some can handle it,
and others, like my father, couldn't.

660
01:14:22,063 --> 01:14:26,329
Tonight, at 12 minutes past 11,
I'll ascend.

661
01:14:27,335 --> 01:14:29,805
And what if you don't
will him your share?

662
01:14:29,973 --> 01:14:32,533
He's already got his father's.
It makes him very powerful.

663
01:14:32,708 --> 01:14:34,540
And what if someone wills you
their share?

664
01:14:34,711 --> 01:14:37,703
It's against the Covenant laws.
If it weren't, I wouldn't let them.

665
01:14:37,882 --> 01:14:39,941
- Why not?
- When one ascends...

666
01:14:40,118 --> 01:14:42,747
...The Power becomes your life.

667
01:14:43,123 --> 01:14:45,353
That's why it ages you.

668
01:14:46,125 --> 01:14:49,390
Will it away, and you die.

669
01:14:57,036 --> 01:14:59,734
Caleb, you cannot do this alone.
We have to go to the others.

670
01:14:59,908 --> 01:15:03,209
We can't do that.
He'll kill us all, including you.

671
01:15:03,712 --> 01:15:05,147
Pogue was the final warning.

672
01:15:05,315 --> 01:15:06,976
- We have to go to your father.
- No.

673
01:15:07,584 --> 01:15:10,985
I know what you're thinking, Mother,
and you know what'll happen.

674
01:15:12,423 --> 01:15:13,856
But he loves you.

675
01:15:16,661 --> 01:15:19,323
Well, then, he'll die with that secret.

676
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:28,841
- Where's Sarah?
- Upstairs, changing.

677
01:15:29,010 --> 01:15:32,343
- You should never have involved her.
- You're right.

678
01:15:33,581 --> 01:15:35,845
But I can't change the past...

679
01:15:36,017 --> 01:15:38,282
...and he's using her against me,
all of you...

680
01:15:39,189 --> 01:15:41,281
...and it's going to stop.

681
01:15:46,965 --> 01:15:48,864
I want you to take Sarah
to the dance.

682
01:15:49,401 --> 01:15:52,337
I'll meet you there. I don't think
he'll try anything in the open.

683
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:55,736
Would you just let us help you?
You know we've got your back.

684
01:15:55,908 --> 01:15:57,706
I know you do.

685
01:15:58,545 --> 01:16:02,606
But please, just once, do what I ask.

686
01:16:17,399 --> 01:16:18,957
You look beautiful, my dear.

687
01:16:23,974 --> 01:16:26,603
- Ready?
- Yeah.

688
01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:35,854
<i>Why can't I go with you?</i>

689
01:16:36,023 --> 01:16:39,550
- I won't risk you.
- I'm scared.

690
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:42,490
Don't be.

691
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:47,135
- I'll see you soon.
- You better.

692
01:16:52,743 --> 01:16:54,643
I promise.

693
01:17:18,272 --> 01:17:21,868
Be careful. I'll call you.

694
01:18:01,057 --> 01:18:03,753
- Hey, any sign of him?
- No.

695
01:18:03,927 --> 01:18:06,862
<i>Good. Listen, I'm on my way.
If he does show...</i>

696
01:18:07,031 --> 01:18:09,226
...please promise me you won't
do anything stupid.

697
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,964
<i>- How's Sarah doing? Can I talk to her?
- Yeah, she's fine. Hang on.</i>

698
01:18:16,976 --> 01:18:20,138
- She was just here.
- Guys, what's going on?

699
01:18:26,487 --> 01:18:27,977
Caleb? Caleb?

700
01:18:34,597 --> 01:18:38,088
What's your plan?
You can't beat me, you know.

701
01:18:45,009 --> 01:18:46,236
Something's happened.

702
01:19:35,936 --> 01:19:37,632
You know...

703
01:19:38,071 --> 01:19:39,801
...I'm just getting the feeling that...

704
01:19:39,974 --> 01:19:42,499
...you're not gonna keep up
your end of the bargain...

705
01:19:42,677 --> 01:19:45,305
...so I took out
a little insurance policy.

706
01:19:51,386 --> 01:19:53,513
She does look quite stunning.

707
01:19:54,123 --> 01:19:57,583
You touch her, and she dies.

708
01:19:58,862 --> 01:20:01,388
In fact, time's running out for Sarah.

709
01:20:01,799 --> 01:20:03,460
So why don't we
get down to business?

710
01:20:17,051 --> 01:20:18,281
Witchy.

711
01:20:20,155 --> 01:20:22,146
Oops, wait.

712
01:20:22,324 --> 01:20:25,020
Did I just say, "witch"?

713
01:20:25,963 --> 01:20:30,457
All right. Tell you what.
I'll make this easy for you.

714
01:20:31,502 --> 01:20:33,629
How about an accident?

715
01:20:34,438 --> 01:20:39,102
You lose control of your car
on the way to the pathetic little dance.

716
01:20:39,277 --> 01:20:42,840
Trust me. I'm good at car accidents.

717
01:20:43,016 --> 01:20:45,006
Everyone'll miss you.

718
01:20:45,183 --> 01:20:47,652
They'll say great things about you.

719
01:20:48,722 --> 01:20:50,883
Only the Covenant
will know the real truth.

720
01:20:51,058 --> 01:20:55,860
But, to them,
you'll become a legend.

721
01:20:58,768 --> 01:21:02,830
The one who gave his life for them.

722
01:21:03,406 --> 01:21:06,900
How about you let her go,
and I let you live out your life?

723
01:21:08,346 --> 01:21:12,010
How about I make you
my "weyotch"?

724
01:21:12,484 --> 01:21:13,815
I'll never will you my power.

725
01:21:15,488 --> 01:21:17,352
Then it looks like trouble for Sarah.

726
01:21:18,390 --> 01:21:19,949
I'll never let that happen.

727
01:21:20,126 --> 01:21:22,492
Fine. Let's do it your way.

728
01:21:40,184 --> 01:21:42,813
Like taking candy from a baby.

729
01:22:29,742 --> 01:22:31,334
Easy as pie.

730
01:22:43,592 --> 01:22:45,252
- You find her?
- No.

731
01:22:49,598 --> 01:22:51,726
Twelve minutes past 11.

732
01:22:52,335 --> 01:22:53,859
Happy birthday, Caleb.

733
01:23:05,618 --> 01:23:07,643
Are we ascending?

734
01:23:09,356 --> 01:23:10,948
Finally!

735
01:23:17,532 --> 01:23:20,160
Scary, huh, Caleb...

736
01:23:21,504 --> 01:23:24,666
...this new power you get
when you ascend?

737
01:23:25,874 --> 01:23:29,403
Frankly, I don't think
you're cut out for it.

738
01:23:31,582 --> 01:23:33,243
So why don't we just call it a night?

739
01:23:34,852 --> 01:23:36,412
Just say the words.

740
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:04,048
Okay, I'm a little impressed.

741
01:24:04,222 --> 01:24:06,485
- Not bad.
- Thanks.

742
01:24:19,372 --> 01:24:21,340
Trying to impress your date, huh?

743
01:25:53,850 --> 01:25:55,512
You ready to say uncle?

744
01:25:55,986 --> 01:25:57,817
I'm ready for you to go to hell.

745
01:26:45,712 --> 01:26:47,646
Leave us, Gorman.

746
01:26:55,958 --> 01:26:57,186
Just say the words.

747
01:27:00,129 --> 01:27:03,566
Say the words, and it's all over.

748
01:27:05,068 --> 01:27:06,433
<i>Listen to me, William.</i>

749
01:27:07,104 --> 01:27:11,042
I need you to understand me.

750
01:27:18,184 --> 01:27:21,676
Come on! Say it! Say the words!

751
01:27:22,922 --> 01:27:24,755
"I..."

752
01:27:25,593 --> 01:27:28,427
- I...
- "...will you..."

753
01:27:29,164 --> 01:27:31,359
...will you...

754
01:27:33,971 --> 01:27:35,529
...nothing.

755
01:27:38,208 --> 01:27:40,200
<i>He is your son.</i>

756
01:27:40,944 --> 01:27:45,382
For once in your life,
think of someone other than yourself.

757
01:27:51,790 --> 01:27:53,282
I...

758
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:55,755
...will...

759
01:27:57,298 --> 01:27:58,822
<i>...you...</i>

760
01:27:59,833 --> 01:28:03,326
<i>...my power.</i>

761
01:31:07,723 --> 01:31:10,191
We searched the entire area.
We didn't find anybody.

762
01:31:14,731 --> 01:31:16,164
How can that be?

763
01:31:34,988 --> 01:31:36,854
Where is he?

764
01:31:39,394 --> 01:31:41,089
I don't know.
