1
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,428
How are you today? Hm?

2
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,979
You feeling good? Oh.

3
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,691
I bet you'd like something to eat.

4
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,155
Here. I've got something
in my pocket here.

5
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:43,782
Some goodies. I'll set the table
for you here, OK?

6
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,999
That's good.

7
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,269
Whoo-hoo!

8
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,439
Whoo!

9
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:22,408
Do I have to put signs up here
to keep you guys off my grass?

10
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,742
Hey, I'm sorry.

11
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,363
Hey! Get out of the way! Ya-hoo!

12
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,705
Whoo!

13
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,875
What do you think you're doing?

14
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,650
Ah-ha!

15
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,159
Whoo!

16
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,617
(yelling)

17
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,912
Look out!

18
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:16,875
Whoo!

19
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,604
Did you see the way that Lowell
threw that rake at me?

20
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:36,515
- Why don't you lay off Lowell for a bit?
- We're just having a little fun.

21
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:40,945
Oh, yeah! Now what is this?

22
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,612
Really nice catch.

23
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,116
You guys are outrageous.

24
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:51,081
Listen, Wolfie,
we've been here for six months.

25
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,623
We got six months more to go.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

26
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:59,379
He told me a story this morning about
how they're gonna refoliate the earth.

27
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,547
Again?!

28
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:07,298
Let's set this thing up
the way it was before, huh?

29
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,093
Oh!

30
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,637
- It missed. It failed.
- (laughter)

31
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,395
First time!

32
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:21,444
Let's stop playing with this thing, OK?

33
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:29,859
I'll tell you this for old flower-face,
he sure knows how to play this thing.

34
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,666
Plenty of time to practise.

35
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,290
Hey, Lowell!

36
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,370
- How about a little of the old poker?
- Yeah. Later.

37
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:21,878
(man) On this first day of a new centum...

38
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,508
..we humbly beg forgiveness...

39
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:32,176
..and dedicate these last forests...

40
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:36,141
..of our once beautiful nation,...

41
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:40,897
..in the hope that
they will one day return...

42
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:44,110
..and grace our foul earth.

43
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,230
Until that day,...

44
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,818
..may God bless these gardens...

45
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:57,196
..and the brave men who care for them.

46
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,569
- Three.
- Three.

47
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,656
Dealer takes one.

48
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,372
The deck's still open. Your bet, Barker.

49
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:27,204
50.

50
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,424
50...

51
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,222
And 100.

52
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,897
Guts.

53
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,815
Come on, son. Throw it on in.

54
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,161
I fold.

55
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,623
You bet $50 and then you're folding?

56
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,794
Right.

57
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:17,096
Well, boys, there's a three.

58
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,846
And there's another three.

59
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:26,023
And there are three big bullets.

60
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:31,689
I will just reach in
and gather up the telepors.

61
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,364
- Beats me.
- You bet it does.

62
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:42,120
I wish they'd hurry up with
that transmission. I wanna go to bed.

63
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,333
I suggest that you reach
deep down inside yourself...

64
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,995
..and try and find something
to keep you awake a little longer,...

65
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:54,469
..because this transmission coming up
may just rekindle your will to live.

66
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,301
You think it'll be a recall?

67
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,891
Let's just say that
I feel my communications...

68
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,968
..may finally bear some fruit.

69
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,145
Mm. Cantaloupes, maybe.

70
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:17,397
I'll let that witticism slide by,...

71
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,949
..because it's my feeling
that they're about to re-establish...

72
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,071
..the parks and forests system.

73
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:26,409
- With you as director?
- You can think of anybody better?

74
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,535
More qualified? Huh?

75
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,627
- Really, it's...
- No, wait a second.

76
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,293
Let me just ask him a question here.

77
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:37,043
I've spent my last eight years
up here, dedicated to this project.

78
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,263
Now, can you think of
anybody more qualified?

79
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:45,224
It's more likely that
they're gonna announce cutbacks.

80
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:49,849
Sorry. There's no way they'll announce
cutbacks, not after this amount of time.

81
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,022
Hey, Lowell, you're dreaming.

82
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:58,320
And you don't think it's time
somebody had a dream again, huh?

83
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:04,120
You don't think that it's time that
somebody cared enough to have a dream?

84
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:08,114
What about the forests? You don't
think anyone should care about them?

85
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:13,838
What's gonna happen if these forests and
all this incredible beauty is lost for ever?

86
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,219
(Wolf) It's been too long, Lowell.

87
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,804
People have got other things to do now.

88
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:34,109
(man) Hi, this is for Valley Forge,
Berkshire, Sequoia.

89
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:40,024
This is Com Central Channel open
for executive order AUL'3423.

90
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,447
Listen to this, boys.

91
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,068
(man #2) This is Anderson speaking.

92
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:48,988
Boys, I have to make an announcement.

93
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:53,168
We have just received orders to abandon...

94
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:56,961
..and nuclear-destruct all the forests...

95
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:00,425
..and return our ships
to commercial service.

96
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:06,634
I received no explanation...

97
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:10,931
..and we must begin at 0900
in the morning.

98
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,145
May God have mercy on us all.

99
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:19,191
- This is it! We're goin' home!
- I can't believe it!

100
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:23,154
- I told you! What'd I say?
- We pack up those domes and go home.

101
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:28,160
Destruct all forest units.
l(iss 'em goodbye, boys.

102
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,959
Hey, Lowell, I'm sorry.

103
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,123
It makes sense, you know?

104
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,417
It's insane.

105
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,291
Let's go.

106
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,526
(I "Rejoice in the Sun" by joan Baez)

I And rejoice

I In the sun

124
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,153
How far out do they go before they blow?

125
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,739
About six miles.
We should feel a hefty jolt.

126
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,374
- I want a front-row seat when they go!
- I'll bet you do.

127
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:23,706
Lowell, do you have to eat
that stuff in here? It stinks.

128
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,046
You never let up, do you?

129
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,373
Oh.

130
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,965
Now you hurt his feelings.

131
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:33,263
I'd like to know what
any one of you knows about real food.

132
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:37,471
What do you mean, real food?
Out of the dirt? That's real food?

133
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:41,352
That's right. This happens
to be nature's greatest gift.

134
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,649
To a celibate, maybe.

135
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:48,360
Come on, you guys.
Maybe he knows something we don't.

136
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,778
Lowell, give me a slice
of that cantaloupe.

137
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:54,906
Don't ask Lowell for a slice.
I'd be delighted to give you a slice of it.

138
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:58,074
just sit down and shut up.
Sit down. Sit down!

139
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,374
And shut up and leave me alone,
all of you, and let me eat.

140
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:05,120
What's the big deal? I can't see
the difference between that and this.

141
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:08,755
You don't see the difference?
The difference is that I grew it.

142
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:12,550
That's what the difference is.
I picked it and I fixed it.

143
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,556
And it has a taste, and it has some colour
and it has a smell.

144
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,595
It calls back a time when there
were flowers all over the earth.

145
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:25,396
There were valleys, and there were
plains of tall green grass...

146
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,860
..that you could lie down in,
that you could go to sleep in.

147
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,740
There were blue skies
and there was fresh air.

148
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:35,282
There were things growing everywhere,
not just in domes...

149
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,910
..blasted millions of miles out into space.

150
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:45,379
Look at that stuff. How can you guys sit
there and say anything to me about this?

151
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,793
Look at this crap! Look at that!

152
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,165
Dried, synthetic crap!

153
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:54,464
You've become so dependent on it,
I bet you can't even live without it.

154
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,636
Why would we want to, Lowell?

155
00:16:56,766 --> 00:17:00,301
Don't you realise how pitiful that is,
what you just asked me?

156
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:04,564
On earth, everywhere you go,
the temperature is 75'.

157
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:10,400
Everything is the same.
All the people are exactly the same.

158
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,690
Now, what kind of life is that?

159
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:18,486
- So why do you wanna go back?
- Because it's not too late to change it.

160
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,824
What do you want, Lowell?
There's hardly any more disease.

161
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,330
There's no more poverty.
Nobody's out of a job.

162
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,125
That's right. Every time we have
the argument, you say the same thing.

163
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:31,091
You give me the same three answers.

164
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,886
'Everybody has a job.'
That's always the last one.

165
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,427
But you know what else there is
no more of? There is no more beauty.

166
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:42,384
There's no more imagination and no
frontiers left to conquer. You know why?

167
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,561
One reason why. The same attitude that
you guys are givin' me in this room today.

168
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,313
And that is: nobody cares.

169
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:56,193
Look on the wall behind you.
Look at that little girl's face.

170
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,156
I know you've seen it.

171
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,786
But you know what she's never
gonna be able to see?

172
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:08,455
She's never gonna be able to see
the simple wonder of a leaf in her hand,...

173
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:13,464
..because there's not gonna be any trees.

174
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,632
Now, you think about that.

175
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:28,011
If people were interested, something
would've been done a long time ago.

176
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:32,312
- Are you ready?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm ready.

177
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:38,323
Hey, wait. Wait a minute. I don't think
you guys understand what this means.

178
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,739
Please don't blow up the domes.

179
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,073
- Which one first?
- Outboard cluster first. Let's hit six.

180
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:48,334
- They're not disposable.
- I haven't got any choice, Lowell.

181
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,500
They're not replaceable.

182
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,711
Where's that tube?

183
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,893
- Ow! My hand.
- Hey, are you all right?

184
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,856
- You better get Lowell to fix that for you.
- Damn.

185
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:59,276
- Really.
- Yeah.

186
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,919
Will you help me?

187
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,548
Oh, yeah.

188
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,720
What are you doing?

189
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,013
Nothing.

190
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,241
Get on in here now.

191
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:12,264
(man on PA) Valley Forge. Safe-distancing
manoeuvre in five minutes.

192
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,436
Valley Forge, please stand by...

193
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:18,313
..for 1000 hours safe-distancing
manoeuvre in five minutes.

194
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:24,774
I'm gonna need your help for that,
you know, Lowell?

195
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,195
OK?

196
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,075
OK?

197
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,333
- There you go.
- Thank you.

198
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,508
Here.

199
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,323
Set gyro at 4406.

200
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,903
(computer hums)

201
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,033
Set gyro to 4406.

202
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,245
(radio) This is Berkshire.
You there, Marty?

203
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:24,838
I'm on it, Neal.

204
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:28,420
0K, we're counting down
for your 4406 distancing,...

205
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:30,595
..about 20 seconds.

206
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,592
- Set for distancing.
- Right.

207
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:40,140
Eight; seven, six, five...

208
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:44,190
..four, three, two, one. That's a go.

209
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,065

210
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:03,040
Thanks, Marty. We're clear.

00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,826
- The bomb, please.
- All right.

214
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,969

218
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,347
Right!

219
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:06,271
0K, looks real good. That's a go.

220
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:11,483
Hey, we're ready for some
real fireworks here. 25 seconds.

221
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:14,155
We're looking forward to it, too, Neal.

222
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:17,655
Keep a steady hand, Marty.
Don't want one of you getting hurt.

223
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,162
Right. wm do.

224
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,619
Where the hell is Lowell now?

225
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:27,586
I think I saw him near One
with some empty flowerpots.

226
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,590
(explosion)

227
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,175
(Barker) That must be Berkshire.

228
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:45,980
Whoo!

229
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,819
(explosion)

230
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,080
- Do we need this?
- Huh?

231
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,045
Hey, Andy, easy with that.

232
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:09,089
No, we use the panel. It's safer.

233
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:13,217
- john, would you get those lights?
- Sure.

234
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,385
Nothin' up on the board.

235
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:19,346
- Well, set six.
- Gotcha.

236
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:23,854
- OK. Arm six.
- Armed.

237
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:40,070

(explosion)

239
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,769
Hit it.

240
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,746

00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:30,435
No.

243

You're not comin' in here.

244
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,955
- What are you doin'?
- You're not comin' in here.

245
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:54,087
- Look, I know how you feel.
- If you knew how I felt,...

246
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,254
..you wouldn't be in here with that.

247
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:59,004
I'm on a tight schedule
and I don't wanna fight.

248
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:02,220
I don't care. You are not
using those things in my forest.

249
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:06,511
- I ain't got time to argue. Now, move!
- You're not gonna do it.

250
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,924
You can't blow up this forest.

251
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:17,554

You still there, Neal?

256
00:30:57,064 --> 00:31:00,018
- Yes. Barker?
- No, it's Lowell.

257
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,723
0h, what's the trouble, Lowell?

258
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:07,819
We seem to be experiencing some kind
of problem with the main coupling.

259
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:11,159
(Neal) 0h, might be one of
your squib pins severing.

260
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,907
(Lowell) That's what we figured it was,...

261
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,530
..so we've gone ahead
and we're setting it now.

262
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:20,166
We'll be getting back to you
just as soon as we can.

- Oh, yeah, OK.

266
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,381
A-OK. Everything's OK.

267
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:35,556

- It's not goin' too well, Neal.

279
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,211
We're gonna have to torch those pins.

280
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:53,050
Better move on it, buddy.
Darkness coming up on you, 33201.

00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:57,177
- Right. We'll try our best.
- Boys here are getting anxious for home.

Yeah, I understand.

00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,977

284
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,562
Right.

285

Blow it any old way you can, LowelL
Big Billy wants to go.

entering darkness. Lowell, do you read?

291
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:40,574
- Right, Neal. We hear ya.
- Big Billy says blow it anyway, LowelL

292
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:43,491

- Didn't catch that, buddy.

we're right on it, Neal. We're tryin'.

You're moving out. You're accelerating.

00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:01,116
I have an emergency ignition
on Valley Forge, reading red 990.

297
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:04,409
I get a two-four on Valley Forge,
reading red.

298
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,871
Valley Forge to Berkshire,
I've got an emergency.

299
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,407
- Neal? Can you read me, Neal?
- I readyou.

300
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:14,755
I've got a main bus blowout on numbers
three, eight and ten panels.

301
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:19,258
I've got a premature detonation on dome
two and an explosion in the cargo deck.

302
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:21,877
Now, please advise me immediately.

303
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:26,225
I read you. Put on Wolf LowelL
No, change that. Give me Barker.

304
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,842
I can't find Barker or Wolf
or Keenan either.

305
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:32,513
I'm afraid they might have
been in dome number two.

306
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:35,650
God, dome two just blew up. Stand by.

307
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,371
Wolf Keenan and Barker missing.

308
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:54,585
What the hell is taking so long?

309
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,670
(Neal) Coming up now, Valley Forge.

310
00:36:56,798 --> 00:37:00,381
(Anderson) Lowell, this is Anderson.
How are you, boy?

311
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,921
I'm OK.

312
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,509
Lowell, if you continue as is, we figure...

313
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:10,262
.. you'll hit the northeastern quadrant of
Saturn's rings at 302 tomorrow morning.

314
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:15,972
- What does that mean?
- We don't think you'll make it through.

315
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:20,901
It's a very bad angle. These ships
weren't built to shoot the rapids.

316
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:25,277
The plan is to find where the explosion
chopped the main bus and re-route it.

317
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,699
You'll have to do some cutting.

318
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:29,868
Where do I start?

319
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:35,043
We tracked a bunch of cargo modules,
probably off your starboard side,...

320
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:39,547
..so we figure maybe one of the cIyo
tanks under the floor cut loose.

321
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:43,886
It may have exposed the main bus duct,
if we're lucky.

322
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:46,051
I'll take a look at it.

323
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,065
(Lowell) Drone number one.

324
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:26,735

325
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,778
(Lowell) This'll stop 'em.

326
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,384
I need you guys to help me fix my leg.

327
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:04,203
From now on, you guys
are working for me.

328
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:10,502
Here's a little medical program.

329
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:18,556
Drone one,...

330
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:22,350
..drone two, drone three,...

331
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,315
..please report immediately to surgery.

332
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,856
Drone number two,...

333
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,822
..you'll perform the operation.

334
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:37,777
Drone number three,
you'll handle the oxygen anaesthesia.

335
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:49,121
Drone number one.

336
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:58,253
Number one, you'll assist.

337
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,559

339
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:24,967
I can't get anywhere near
that main bus duct.

340
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,973
Everything's just all torn up down there.

341
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:32,900
Listen, Freeman.
That's your first name, right?

342
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,605
Yes.

343
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,275
- Any family, Freeman?
- No, sir.

344
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:40,530
Well, listen, Freeman.

345
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:45,037
You've been with this project since
the start; and you've known the risks.

346
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,195
Yes, sir.

347
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:51,041
L.. I don't really know
how to say this, Freeman.

348
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,539
It's all right, sir.

349
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:58,339
- We've got some trouble.
- I figured.

350
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,509
Yes. Um...

351
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:06,267
- I'm really sorry, Freeman.
- Sorry, sir? About what?

352
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:10,522
We'll never be able to stop you
before you hit the rings.

353
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,849
I see.

354
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:17,104
Freeman, you might want to consider...

355
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,862
Suicide, sir?

356
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,116
No.

357
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:28,827
I just don't think that I'd ever
be able to do anything like that.

358
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:33,869
Well, the best we can do, then, is send
out a search party the long way around.

359
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:38,133
But it's kind of like a needle in a haystack,
if you know what I mean.

360
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:40,298
Yes, sir.

361
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:45,053
- Freeman?
- Yes, sir?

362
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:51,056
God bless you, Freeman.

363
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:54,024
You're a hell of an American.

364
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,189
Thank you, sir.

365
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,285
I think I am.

366
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,498
(beeping)

367
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,049
(rattling)

368
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,735
(Lowell) Drone number three.

369
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,785
Drone number three, keep moving.

370
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,955
Follow one and two.

371
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,127
Follow one and two!

372
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,637
Why didn't you follow them?

373
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:40,894
(beeping)

374
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:17,181
(crackling)

375
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:07,023
(sighs)

376
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,608
Now dig a hole for him.

377
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:36,565
Make it seven feet long...
and three feet wide.

378
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:09,104
OK, now, put him...
put him down in it.

379
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:21,861
And then remain there,
cos I would like to say something...

380
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:24,451
..before you cover him over.

381
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,792
Uh...

382
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:34,920


383
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:39,130
I would like to be able to say a prayer...

384
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,974
..but I don't...

385
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:49,897
..really know how to say it.

386
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:56,446
Wolf and Barker and Keenan,...

387
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:02,276
..they weren't exactly my friends.

388
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,578
But I did like them.

389
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,958
And, uh,...

390
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,463
..I don't... I don't think...

391
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:28,307
..that I'll ever be able to...

392
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:33,733
..excuse what it is that I did,...

393
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,899
..but I had to do it.

394
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:42,322
And...

395
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:59,426
I guess that's all that I have to say.

396
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:06,345
You can cover him over now.

397
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:41,297
(clears throat)

398
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,927
Boys,...

399
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:49,601
..I'd like to make an announcement. Um...

400
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:54,602
From now on,...

401
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:58,188
..drone number two,...

402
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:00,726
..you will answer to the name of Huey.

403
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:06,608
And drone number one,...

404
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:10,077
.. you will answer to the name of Dewey.

405
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:17,127
And little Louie, God bless him, he's...

406
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:20,038
..he's not with us any more.

407
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:26,133
Huey,...

408
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,884
..you take one step forward.

409
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,478
That's super.

410
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:37,274
Now, Dewey, you also
take one step forward.

411
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:40,398
That's really excellent!

412
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:42,900
Now, um...

413
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:48,323
..you see, what I've done is,
I've reprogrammed both of you...

414
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:52,450
..so that now you'll respond directly to me.

415
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:57,835
You'll still run the same maintenance
checks and perform the same duties...

416
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,120
..that you've been doing on the ship,...

417
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:04,502
..but you'll also be spending much
more time with me in the forest.

418
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:11,348
And you shouldn't have much of a problem
in making the necessary readjustments.

419
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:15,728
And I realise that...

420
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:19,603
..we've really had a rough journey,...

421
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:24,644
..and we sure got our work cut out for us.

422
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:30,616
But I think that the three of us,
together; as a team,...

423
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,538
Is that all right with you guys?

424
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:45,548
The three of us together
are gonna plant a tree.

425
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:51,128
Trowel, watering can...

426
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:53,798
..and the tree.

427
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:01,893
Now, this is the mulch.

428
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,481
That's what makes the tree grow.

429
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:10,441
Now.

430
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:14,073
Now, Huey, you're gonna plant the tree...

431
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,956
..and, Dewey, you're gonna dig the ditch.

432
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:21,663
Now, we're gonna do it right here
on the side of the hill.

433
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,381
That's a real good hole, Dewey.

434
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:32,344
Now,...

435
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:36,141
..Huey, here's the tree.

436
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,438
Put a little mulch.

437
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:48,321
There. OK. Now, plant the tree.

438
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,786
That's pitiful. Pitiful!

439
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:06,413
That's exactly the opposite
of what it's supposed to be.

440
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:09,630
(I "Silent Running" by joan Baez)

00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:27,567

442
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:35,785

443
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:40,996

l Running silent in my sleep

452
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,013
What's the matter?

453
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:47,493
I know you're sad about Louie.

454
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:52,335
But he got careless! And you see
what happens when you get careless?

455
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,926
OK, now, you guys go on
back to your work.

456
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:26,589
Hey, how are you today, huh?

457
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,923
Ow! You bit my hand.
Don't you ever bite my hand again.

458
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:32,232
I You can take a tip from Smokey

459
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:34,527
I That there's nothing like a tree

460
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:36,951
I Oh, they're great for kids to climb in

461
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:39,323
I And they're beautiful to see

462
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:41,498
(hums)

463
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:57,014
(mutters)

464
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,815
Huey... and Dewey.

465
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:15,483
I want you two guys to report
right away to the recreation room.

466
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:23,914
Well, I see you're already here.

467
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:27,710
I bet you wonder why I gathered
you here, haven't you, huh?

468
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:30,296
Well, I wanna beg your indulgence.

469
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:32,964
I got some new programs here for you.

470
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:38,223
Now.

471
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:40,759
Huey, come over and sit down here.

472
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:43,565
Dewey, you come right up here
and sit down.

473
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:53,775
You can come a little closer
if you want to, Dewey. Good boy.

474
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:57,609
That's for you, that's for you...

475
01:05:57,745 --> 01:05:59,785
..and that's for me.

476
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:07,501
OK, boys.

477
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:11,509
Now.

478
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:19,755
I'm about to take you two guys
for every dime you got.

479
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:31,355
Two, three.

480
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:34,028
Five, five, five.

481
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:39,823
Now, boys, let's play cards.

482
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:52,082
OK.

483
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:54,838
Now, Dewey.

484
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:57,092
(blows)

485
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:04,349
OK.

486
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:07,227
How many cards you want, Dewey?

487
01:07:15,323 --> 01:07:17,731
What are you doin'?
You threw down three kings.

488
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:19,112
(blows)

489
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:23,905
You're nuts, you know that?
Well, your hand is obviously dead,...

490
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,412
..and let's see what you got here.

491
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:31,370
Well, he's got trash, so obviously
I'm the winner with three sevens.

492
01:07:31,506 --> 01:07:33,463
Thank you, boys. I'm sorry.

493
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:38,586
You gotta get up in the morning to
beat old Freeman. Early in the morning.

494
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:43,015
It's all mine. This time we'll play another
hand and I don't want any mistakes.

495
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:47,520
We're not playing for 3-in-1 oil here.
We're playing for money.

496
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:51,977
OK. Now, Dewey, you took two.

497
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:03,985
- (Huey blows)
- No, I wasn't looking.

498
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:09,242
Hey, what have I said about
talking between you guys? That's not fair.

499
01:08:09,377 --> 01:08:12,378
I'm all by myself and you're
talkin' between yourselves.

500
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:15,174
That's a house rule. No more talking.

501
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,755
Now, how many cards d'you want?

502
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:22,675
You don't want any cards? You just
saw what the man did last hand.

503
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:28,018
All right. Dealer's taking two.

504
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:48,155
All right, Huey.

505
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:52,248
What have you got?

506
01:09:03,014 --> 01:09:05,635
The man had a full house and he knew it!

507
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:09,467
Now, how about that?
The man had a full house and he knew it.

508
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:14,271
(Lowell laughs)

509
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:18,977
Huey and Dewey beat me
at my own card game!

510
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,779
(laughter continues)

511
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:09,694
I know. I've actually been eating that crap.

512
01:10:16,087 --> 01:10:18,126
(waste disposer churns)

513
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:24,844
Now let's go to the forest
and get some real food.

514
01:11:02,884 --> 01:11:05,968
(Lowell) What has happened to the forest?

515
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:31,196
(Lowell) Huey, go get me the grey book.

516
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:48,381
I don't know.

517
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:51,679
I just cannot figure out what's wrong.

518
01:12:56,038 --> 01:13:01,543
OK, now, listen to me. I want you to
make a slow, complete, 360' turn for me.

519
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:06,253
OK.

520
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:11,343
Now, hold it. Stop right there.

521
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:14,388
That's good. Now take a sample there.

522
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:15,926
Oh, no.

523
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:19,842
We're coming to the dome.
Wait right there, Huey.

524
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:48,251
(squeaks)

525
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:51,134
Huey, I thought I told you
to stay in the forest?

526
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:55,044
(squeaks)

527
01:13:57,224 --> 01:13:59,680
You're braced. You can't fall back.

528
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:06,438
It's OK, Huey. I got it, I got it.

529
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:15,660
That'll make you rest a little easier now.

530
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:21,912
Your little light.

531
01:14:30,091 --> 01:14:32,130
No, no, I know where it is.

532
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:54,486
No, it's OK, Huey.

533
01:14:57,702 --> 01:14:59,778
just hold steady now.

534
01:15:06,085 --> 01:15:08,291
You won't get that again.

535
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:11,127
There.

536
01:15:13,551 --> 01:15:16,172
Now, that should be better.

537
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:23,049
Dewey, go get me
that L-arm circuit wrench.

538
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:34,317
I understand.

539
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:39,910
I think I can manage here without it.

540
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:44,953
There.

541
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:48,665
I'm screwin' you in tight.

542
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:22,574
I'm sorry, Huey,...

543
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:27,166
..but that's the best that I can do.

544
01:16:37,676 --> 01:16:42,219
I tried, but that... that's all
I can do for him, Dewey.

545
01:16:58,531 --> 01:17:03,691
I don't know, Huey. It's just not working.

546
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:05,655
(blows)

547
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:08,623
(Lowell) The forest is dying.

548
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:12,908
I have tried...

549
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:16,044
..everything.

550
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:20,505
And I just don't know what the hell it is.

551
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,738
(voices on radio)

552
01:17:55,087 --> 01:17:57,127
(voices on radio continue)

553
01:18:07,391 --> 01:18:13,014
(Neal) Come in, Valley Forge. This is
Berkshire to Valley Forge. Do you read me?

554
01:18:13,147 --> 01:18:18,141
Valley Forge. Come in, Valley Forge.
This is Berkshire. Can you read?

555
01:18:18,277 --> 01:18:22,820
Valley Forge. Come in, Valley Forge.
This is Berkshire. Can you read?

556
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:33,578
We got a plot on you, LowelL Fantastic!

557
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:37,754
We're looking forward to seeing you,
buddy. You made it!

558
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:45,382
Transmit, will ya?
Please acknowledge immediately.

559
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:48,182
Come in, Valley Forge. Can you read?

560
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:15,743
Please transmit immediately.
Berkshire to Valley Forge.

561
01:19:15,876 --> 01:19:18,711
How about a word, Lowell, huh?

562
01:19:23,258 --> 01:19:24,883
Hi.

563
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:26,884
(Anderson) Lowell?

564
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:29,468
I'm mighty glad to see ya, boy.

565
01:19:31,392 --> 01:19:34,143
- Who is this?
- This is Anderson, LowelL

566
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:37,187
My God, we've looked
high and low for you.

567
01:19:38,232 --> 01:19:41,932
How did you find me?
Why did you even try?

568
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:47,408
Hey, you must be kidding. We couldn't let
you go without at least trying to find you.

569
01:19:47,533 --> 01:19:49,988
We said we'd send out a search party.

570
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:51,992
I guess I forgot.

571
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:56,664
It wasn't easy finding you either,
even with our deep -space tracking.

572
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,998
- I don't suppose it was.
- Freeman,...

573
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:02,710
.. you'll have to find some way
to jettison the dome.

574
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:07,834
And it's awfully dark out here,
so it'll be safer if you don't blow it up.

575
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:10,212
The sun.

576
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:12,636
The sun! That's what it is.

577
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:15,388
- Did you hear what he said? It's the sun!
- What?

578
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:19,268
Uh, nothing. I was just saying
that everything is all right.

579
01:20:19,398 --> 01:20:21,971
Where was your big explosion?
We can't see it.

580
01:20:22,109 --> 01:20:24,647
The explosion's on
the other side of the ship.

581
01:20:24,778 --> 01:20:28,776
other side? 0K We'll be docking
on your port side in about six hours.

582
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:30,022
Right, six hours.

583
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:33,658
Huey, Dewey, come on.
We can still save the forest.

584
01:21:36,809 --> 01:21:38,848
It's gonna work.

585
01:22:15,514 --> 01:22:17,507
Dewey,...

586
01:22:17,641 --> 01:22:22,801
..I've taught you everything that I know
about taking care of the forest here.

587
01:22:25,023 --> 01:22:27,063
And, uh,...

588
01:22:29,403 --> 01:22:32,938
..that's all that
you have to do from now on,...

589
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:36,109
..is just maintain the forest.

590
01:22:38,078 --> 01:22:41,992
Now, these lights here'll do
the job that the sun would do.

591
01:22:43,709 --> 01:22:46,164
They'll help revive everything.

592
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:52,130


593
01:22:58,223 --> 01:23:00,679
I just can't do it any more.

594
01:23:03,187 --> 01:23:05,226
You see, things...

595
01:23:08,734 --> 01:23:11,604
..things just haven't worked out for me.

596
01:23:21,705 --> 01:23:24,457
Take care of yourself, Dewey.

597
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:32,756
Huey, you have to come with me...

598
01:23:32,883 --> 01:23:37,011
..because you're just not working
well enough to help Dewey.

599
01:23:40,057 --> 01:23:42,180
(Neal) Berkshire to Valley Forge.

600
01:23:42,309 --> 01:23:46,556
We'll be docking on your port side
in two hours. Stand by for updates.

601
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:24,048
(Lowell) Take good care
of the forest, Dewey.

602
01:24:46,456 --> 01:24:48,864
You know, when I was a kid,...

603
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:53,497
..I put a note into a bottle...

604
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:56,300
..and it had my name and address on it.

605
01:24:58,677 --> 01:25:03,303
And then I threw the bottle
into the ocean.

606
01:25:05,392 --> 01:25:10,350
And I never knew if anybody ever found it.

607
01:27:05,762 --> 01:27:07,802
(explosion)

608
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:18,728
