1
00:00:00,632 --> 00:00:03,033
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:24,966
(high-pitched alarm wailing)

3
00:00:26,532 --> 00:00:29,433
(explosion bangs)

4
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:32,266
(horse neighing)

5
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:52,433
- What's the matter?

6
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:53,799
- [Lapporte] I've had
 enough of this damn digging.

7
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:56,733
And that drunken bastard
doesn't do a thing.

8
00:01:02,532 --> 00:01:03,699
- If you've had enough,

9
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,899
then take off.

10
00:01:07,899 --> 00:01:10,133
- Everything looks real
  enough now for our claim.

11
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:11,566
- Don't look real
 enough for the people

12
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:14,300
who are supposed to believe
 that we've found gold.

13
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,467
Do you understand?

14
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:19,632
Let 'em think it's
 a mountain of gold.

15
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,333
(explosion bangs)

16
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:33,766
(mellow music)

17
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,467
(dogs whining)

18
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:27,532
- Good, good.

19
00:02:31,632 --> 00:02:33,000
Hello, hello.

20
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:35,200
Go on.

21
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:38,866
Good, good.

22
00:02:51,532 --> 00:02:53,467
(whip cracks)

23
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:54,300
Go, go!

24
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,699
Go, you huskies.

25
00:02:57,699 --> 00:03:01,966
Hey, hey!

26
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:04,133
Hey!

27
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:05,532
Go, you huskies!

28
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:08,933
(speaking in foreign language)

29
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:12,433
(mellow orchestral music)

30
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:16,899
Hey!

31
00:03:16,899 --> 00:03:17,799
(whistling)

32
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:19,133
Go, go!

33
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:21,400
Go!

34
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,066
Hey!

35
00:03:23,066 --> 00:03:24,033
Hey!

36
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:27,532
- [Sanders] Help!

37
00:03:27,532 --> 00:03:28,666
Help!

38
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,699
(gunshot bangs)

39
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:32,266
Help!

40
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:37,467
Don!

41
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:41,966
It's me, Don!

42
00:03:41,966 --> 00:03:42,799
- Sanders?

43
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,333
- [Sanders] I need help.

44
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,166
- I'm coming.

45
00:03:58,266 --> 00:04:00,200
Ho, hey!

46
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,033
Get moving, get in there.

47
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,100
Go, go!

48
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:13,333
Sanders, your leg,
  what happened?

49
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,599
Where's Billy?

50
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,133
- Billy, my son's
  down in the mine.

51
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:17,066
He's trapped there.

52
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:18,532
- Since when?

53
00:04:18,532 --> 00:04:20,433
- Dunno, three or four days?

54
00:04:20,433 --> 00:04:23,200
But Billy's still
 alive I can hear him.

55
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,599
- [Don] How did it happen?

56
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:27,233
- [Sanders] Oh, some boulders
 suddenly rolled down.

57
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:31,266
I tried to move them but
  they're too heavy for me.

58
00:04:31,266 --> 00:04:34,333
- [Don] Sanders, I warned
  you not to take him.

59
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,532
It's a pole of today Indians.

60
00:04:35,532 --> 00:04:36,367
It's sacred.

61
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:37,833
- Hogwash!

62
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:41,500
I don't believe in any taboos,
 in any Indian hocus-pocus.

63
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,333
I believe there's gold there.

64
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,666
And plenty of them.

65
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:45,500
- Buck!

66
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,333
Wait.

67
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:49,500
Wait, Buck, hold on.

68
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,400
Leave it.

69
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,166
Okay, Buck, here we go.

70
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,400
(grunting)

71
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:03,200
- I'm coming, be patient, son.

72
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,200
Hey Buck.

73
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,033
Billy?

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,833
Billy.

75
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,333
(grunts)

76
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,166
Go.

77
00:05:12,066 --> 00:05:13,333
I got you.

78
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,166
(Billy groaning)

79
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:14,999
Billy, Billy.

80
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,300
You're hot.

81
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,066
It'll be alright now, Billy.

82
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:37,733
Sanders!

83
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:41,200
- Billy.

84
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:46,632
(Billy groaning)

85
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,333
Billy.

86
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:10,033
(Billy groaning)

87
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:12,799
(Billy groaning)

88
00:06:36,532 --> 00:06:37,766
Is he?

89
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:39,799
- No, no, he's got a
 very high temperature.

90
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,367
He's gotta see a
  doctor right away.

91
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,966
I'll take him to Paradise Creek.

92
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:45,666
I'll take the sled
 across the glacier,

93
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:46,866
down to Honie River.

94
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:47,799
- Yeah.

95
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:49,266
- There, I'll get a canoe

96
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:50,899
and head to Camp Keno.

97
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:53,599
I'll get some supplies from
 the store at Lonesome Corner.

98
00:06:55,566 --> 00:06:57,367
- That's sure real
  nice of you, Don.

99
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,133
- Yeah.

100
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,899
(Billy groaning)

101
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,566
Let's move.

102
00:07:10,566 --> 00:07:12,233
There's long ways to go.

103
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:14,999
(brooding music)

104
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:41,632
(Billy groaning)

105
00:07:41,632 --> 00:07:43,166
- Thanks, Don.

106
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,766
- Don't mention it.

107
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:57,467
(brooding music)

108
00:08:12,866 --> 00:08:13,699
- Pa.

109
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,333
- Get the best doctor
 in Paradise Creek.

110
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,467
- You're not coming along?

111
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:20,467
- No Don, I'm staying here.

112
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:21,899
I'll just be in the way.

113
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:24,833
Without me, you'll travel
  faster, you'll see.

114
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,133
- [Don] But your leg, if
you don't come with me,

115
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:27,799
you'll get gangrene.

116
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,532
- Two legs or one
 leg, doesn't matter.

117
00:08:30,532 --> 00:08:31,999
I ain't leaving here.

118
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,100
There's gold here.

119
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,033
And Billy's gonna have it
  better than I ever did.

120
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,733
Take it for the doctor and you.

121
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:44,733
- Not for me, for the doctor.

122
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,400
- But you tell no
 one about the gold.

123
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,233
No one has to know
  what I found here.

124
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:49,166
- I won't tell anyone.

125
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,100
I just saw the today Indians.

126
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,433
They'll find out about it.

127
00:08:51,433 --> 00:08:53,100
- Don't worry, I've got Buck.

128
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,133
- Okay, if that's
 the way you want it.

129
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,266
We'll be back as soon as I can

130
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:56,100
and bring some
 medicine for your leg.

131
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,200
Here!

132
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,566
(whistles)
  (yells)

133
00:09:01,566 --> 00:09:03,233
I'll be back in two days!

134
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:05,532
(yelling)

135
00:09:05,532 --> 00:09:09,666
(mellow orchestral music)

136
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,367
- Well boy, it's
 just you and me now.

137
00:09:18,632 --> 00:09:21,532
(yelling)
 (whistling)

138
00:09:21,532 --> 00:09:25,467
(speaking in foreign language)

139
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,833
- Whoa.

140
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,133
- [Man] My nuggets are in there.

141
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:48,133
- [Mover] Then you
 found lead, not gold.

142
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:54,866
Alright.

143
00:09:54,866 --> 00:09:56,632
(grunts)

144
00:09:56,632 --> 00:09:57,566
- [Man] Damn wheel.

145
00:09:57,566 --> 00:09:58,799
Can someone give me a hand here?

146
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:05,400
- [Mover] There
 goes the rest of it.

147
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:16,632
- 10 ounces.

148
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,166
- [Cotton] Mr. Fox, 10 ounces.

149
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:22,833
- Sheriff, I hope
  that you're aware

150
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,500
every prospect in Camp Keno
 has given you for safekeeping.

151
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,400
All the gold is mine in
the last five months.

152
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,899
- I'm aware, Fox.

153
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:32,300
But I'll deposit it safely in
 the bank at Paradise Creek.

154
00:10:35,266 --> 00:10:36,733
Rose.

155
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:37,866
- The last one.
 - Alright, I'll put it

156
00:10:37,866 --> 00:10:40,033
with the others.

157
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:41,300
- Have we got it all up?

158
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,766
- [Rose] Captain Brandy
hasn't been here yet.

159
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:44,266
- Tell him to hurry.

160
00:10:44,266 --> 00:10:46,367
As soon as Buffins get
  here, we'll start moving.

161
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:49,866
We wanna make to at least
  north river it gets dark.

162
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:51,433
Better go see what
 the captain's up to.

163
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:55,866
- Alright, I'll get it.

164
00:10:55,866 --> 00:10:57,999
- [Man] I just
 can't free (grunts).

165
00:10:57,999 --> 00:10:59,433
- [Tinker] Come on,
 let me try again.

166
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:02,033
- What's the matter, people?

167
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:04,699
- It doesn't concern strangers
 especially a black man.

168
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:05,999
- [Man] These aren't black.

169
00:11:12,866 --> 00:11:14,400
- [Man] Here it
 goes, once more now.

170
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,666
(grunts)

171
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:16,500
Oh, gee!

172
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,200
- [Ham] Here let
  me give it a try.

173
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,433
(grunting)

174
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,100
- [Man] Hey, thank
  you, stranger.

175
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,033
- My name is Ham.

176
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,333
- [Man] How'd you get so strong?

177
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,200
Eating corn pone?

178
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,367
- [Cotton] How's
  it look, Buffins?

179
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:36,666
- The trail at Lonesome
 Corner looks alright, Sheriff,

180
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,532
but I can't swear the
 Bear Path is safe.

181
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,066
- Well, we'll see
  when we get there.

182
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,433
Worst come to worst, we'll
  cross over at Eagle Gorge.

183
00:11:42,433 --> 00:11:43,532
- Shall we move out, Sheriff?

184
00:11:43,532 --> 00:11:44,467
- No, just a few minutes more.

185
00:11:44,467 --> 00:11:46,166
Captain Brandy's late.

186
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,066
- [Buffins] Again?

187
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:49,699
- Captain Brandy.

188
00:11:56,033 --> 00:11:56,899
Captain Brandy.

189
00:11:59,632 --> 00:12:00,933
- What's the matter?

190
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:02,532
- The transport is leaving.

191
00:12:02,532 --> 00:12:04,133
Only the captain hasn't
brought his gold.

192
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:05,532
Do you know where he is?

193
00:12:05,532 --> 00:12:07,233
- Of course, I know where he is.

194
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:09,033
He's probably still sleeping.

195
00:12:09,033 --> 00:12:11,733
I'll go and look for him.

196
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:13,933
At this hour, no one can
talk to him, you know?

197
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:16,866
(yells)

198
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:20,833
Oh, hey, captain.

199
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:22,966
- Ahoy!

200
00:12:22,966 --> 00:12:25,033
- Captain, the
 transport's leaving.

201
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:26,333
- [Betty] Come on, get up.

202
00:12:28,866 --> 00:12:30,433
- Full steam ahead.

203
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,833
Breakfast.

204
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,999
- When do you you expect
  to send your money along?

205
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:36,433
You have to hurry.

206
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:42,467
- Second breakfast.

207
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:44,733
- Captain, they're
  leaving without your gold.

208
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,733
- I can't remember
  where to find it

209
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:50,133
until I'm dead drunk.

210
00:12:50,133 --> 00:12:51,100
- How long is that?

211
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,233
- Least, two or three bottles.

212
00:12:52,233 --> 00:12:53,367
- That's impossible.

213
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:55,367
(laughing)

214
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:58,866
- Then let them sail
 without my cargo.

215
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:00,766
Ship ahoy!

216
00:13:00,766 --> 00:13:02,300
- Well, it's your gold.

217
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,599
- Betty, my third breakfast.

218
00:13:04,599 --> 00:13:06,799
- [Man] Everything we own on
 this world's on that wagon.

219
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:08,033
- I know.

220
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:09,699
I'll defend it with
 my life if I have to.

221
00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:11,200
- Dad, you can go.

222
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,532
The captain's not
sending his gold along.

223
00:13:13,532 --> 00:13:14,367
- Okay, let's go.

224
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,632
We wasted enough time.

225
00:13:15,632 --> 00:13:16,999
- Why isn't that old
 sop sending his gold

226
00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:17,899
along with the other men?

227
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:19,033
Smells fishy to me.

228
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:20,733
- That's enough of that.

229
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,966
- [Man] Your own mother
 smells fishy to you, Tinker.

230
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:25,300
- [Tinker] You can
  say that again.

231
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,899
- [Man] Alright, out of the way.

232
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:30,733
- Goodbye, Rose.

233
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:31,933
- Dad, I'm afraid.

234
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:33,833
- Nonsense, there's
nothing to be afraid of.

235
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,899
In about six days,
  I'll be back here.

236
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:36,899
Don't worry.

237
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,133
Let's go.

238
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:50,866
Bye.

239
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:55,632
Go!

240
00:13:55,632 --> 00:13:56,799
Alright, move!

241
00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:00,532
(man yelling)

242
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:13,400
(people yelling goodbyes)

243
00:14:15,933 --> 00:14:18,532
(mellow music)

244
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,532
- You wait here.

245
00:14:43,532 --> 00:14:44,799
I'll go ahead and
 scout around a little

246
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,066
and see if we can
  use the Bear Path.

247
00:14:46,066 --> 00:14:47,733
- Good idea.

248
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:50,632
- If I think we can get
 through without much trouble.

249
00:14:50,632 --> 00:14:51,866
I'll give a signal.

250
00:14:51,866 --> 00:14:53,066
Three pistol shots.

251
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:55,266
- Alright, Buffins,
 see you later.

252
00:14:55,266 --> 00:14:56,500
- [Buffins] Later.

253
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,433
- Hello, Shat.

254
00:14:57,433 --> 00:14:58,999
How about offering us a drink?

255
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:11,066
- Ho, ho.

256
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:14,933
If anyone around here knows
whether the Bear Path is clear,

257
00:15:14,933 --> 00:15:16,833
that old geezer does.

258
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,866
- Maybe, but he won't tell us.

259
00:15:19,866 --> 00:15:20,866
- Why not?

260
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:22,367
- Because no one in the world

261
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,233
has ever heard more than
  three words from old Shat.

262
00:15:24,233 --> 00:15:25,532
- [Man] What were they?

263
00:15:25,532 --> 00:15:26,733
- Come along and listen.

264
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:32,500
Since when have you work
  for Lonesome Corner, Shat?

265
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,467
- I don't recall.

266
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:36,632
(men laughing)

267
00:15:36,632 --> 00:15:39,233
(mellow music)

268
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:12,433
- You weren't born here, Shat.

269
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:15,699
What did you do
 before you got here?

270
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,699
- I don't recall.

271
00:16:18,699 --> 00:16:21,300
(men laughing)

272
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,599
- [Don] Shat.

273
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:24,433
- [Cotton] Hi, Don.

274
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:25,699
- Oh, Cotton.

275
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:26,733
Where are you headed?

276
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:28,433
- We're going to Paradise Creek.

277
00:16:28,433 --> 00:16:30,699
- Cotton, this boy is very sick.

278
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:31,532
He's got to see a doctor.

279
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,766
Can you take him along?

280
00:16:32,766 --> 00:16:33,899
- Certain thing
  in the world, Don.

281
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:35,166
What's more, he'll have

282
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,467
the most expensive
  bed in the world.

283
00:16:36,467 --> 00:16:37,566
A bed of gold.

284
00:16:37,566 --> 00:16:38,766
Come on, let's go.

285
00:16:38,766 --> 00:16:39,632
- Yeah, I'd rather
  sleep on gold.

286
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:41,066
Better than anything.

287
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,566
- [Man] You can say that again.

288
00:16:44,532 --> 00:16:46,200
- [Buffins] Hello, boys.

289
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,566
What's catching so long?

290
00:16:47,566 --> 00:16:48,566
- [Mark] I'll ask the questions.

291
00:16:48,566 --> 00:16:49,766
How many are there?

292
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:54,500
- The sheriff, four
 men and deputy.

293
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,766
- Not even too many
 for each of us.

294
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,400
- Easy boy, slow don.

295
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,300
You'll live a lot
  longer that way.

296
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,100
We can ambush them right there.

297
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,532
We'll catch them off
  guard like sitting ducks.

298
00:17:04,532 --> 00:17:06,033
How long before they get here?

299
00:17:06,033 --> 00:17:07,033
- About an hour.

300
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:08,400
Hey!

301
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,233
- [Mark] Let's go to work.

302
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,133
(brooding music)

303
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,300
Over there.

304
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,000
(somber music)

305
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:49,599
- For the doctor.

306
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:50,899
- Don, why don't
  you come with us?

307
00:17:50,899 --> 00:17:51,833
- No, I can't.

308
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:52,999
Billy's father has a bad leg.

309
00:17:52,999 --> 00:17:54,467
I have to go back.

310
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:56,367
- Now, tell him there's no
 reason to worry about his boy.

311
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,433
He'll have the best doctor
 there is on Paradise Creek.

312
00:17:58,433 --> 00:17:59,266
- Thank you.

313
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:06,100
(gunshot bangs)

314
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,799
- [Buffins] The Bear
 Path is all clear.

315
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,400
- Alright, men, let's move on.

316
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,367
Let's go, round up.

317
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,400
(yells)

318
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:28,799
- Shat.

319
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,100
Shat, I need medicine.

320
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,300
Medicine.

321
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,666
Medicine.

322
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:36,500
Medicine.

323
00:18:37,933 --> 00:18:38,866
- I don't recall.

324
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,033
- Over there?

325
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,333
Here?

326
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:05,333
Shat, I'll take these.

327
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:10,899
Here.

328
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:15,566
It's more than enough.

329
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:17,599
Thanks.

330
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:20,699
- You know, if you ask me,
  it's pretty suspicious.

331
00:19:20,699 --> 00:19:23,033
The Bear Path being so
 quiet all of a sudden.

332
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,933
- I agree with you.

333
00:19:25,933 --> 00:19:27,632
It's a real death trap, usually.

334
00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:30,233
No one knows we've
  come this way.

335
00:19:30,233 --> 00:19:31,632
- Yeah, I hope you're right.

336
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,899
(grunting)

337
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,433
- [Mark] Alright now,
 get out of sight.

338
00:19:57,266 --> 00:20:00,266
(suspenseful music)

339
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,066
- [Cotton] Ho!

340
00:21:30,066 --> 00:21:31,500
Hey, couple of you guys,

341
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,200
get up here and move
  that tree out of the way.

342
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:41,733
- [Mark] Hands up.

343
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:47,866
- [Robbie] Get off your horse.

344
00:21:51,699 --> 00:21:54,799
(gunshot bangs)

345
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,833
(horse neighing)

346
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:59,500
(gunshots bang)

347
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,966
(grunts)

348
00:22:06,966 --> 00:22:09,066
(grunts)

349
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:14,566
(grunts)

350
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:17,467
(fast-paced music)

351
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,533
(punches thudding)

352
00:23:36,533 --> 00:23:39,133
(somber music)

353
00:23:56,899 --> 00:23:59,100
- [Lapporte] Hey,
 we've got the gold.

354
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,999
- [Buffins] Come here, Mark.

355
00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:05,632
- [Lapporte] What's
 the matter, boss?

356
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:08,533
- My brother, Robbie, is dead.

357
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:32,500
Get the horses.

358
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,566
(Billy groaning)

359
00:24:52,066 --> 00:24:52,899
Well.

360
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:22,433
- Ho!

361
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:25,866
Where'd he come from?

362
00:25:26,866 --> 00:25:28,333
- He was in the wagon.

363
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:29,266
- I didn't see him.

364
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:34,100
- What kind of a man are you?

365
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:34,966
The kid's sick.

366
00:25:36,433 --> 00:25:38,632
Come on, put the gold in the
 sandbags and let's take off.

367
00:25:38,632 --> 00:25:40,300
Robbie and kid come along.

368
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,333
Buffins.

369
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:42,766
- Yeah, boss?

370
00:25:42,766 --> 00:25:43,999
- Take your share.

371
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:44,933
- [Buffins] Is this
 part of my share?

372
00:25:44,933 --> 00:25:46,233
- That wound wasn't planned.

373
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:50,533
It will help make the people
 believe in your story.

374
00:25:50,533 --> 00:25:52,033
- [Buffins] Maybe.

375
00:25:57,833 --> 00:25:58,666
- [Betty] Here.

376
00:25:58,666 --> 00:25:59,833
- Thank you.

377
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:01,133
Must be a pretty rich land here,

378
00:26:01,133 --> 00:26:02,899
we can ship at
  all that much old.

379
00:26:02,899 --> 00:26:04,599
- You want to by
  yourself a plane?

380
00:26:05,699 --> 00:26:06,933
But with that broken hand,

381
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:08,632
you won't be able
  to do very much.

382
00:26:09,866 --> 00:26:11,733
- That's not broken?

383
00:26:11,733 --> 00:26:13,666
- So why is it in a
  sling if it's not broken?

384
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:16,833
- Well, that's a
  long story, madam.

385
00:26:17,733 --> 00:26:19,632
Did you ever hear of Hammer Ham?

386
00:26:19,632 --> 00:26:20,599
- Nope.

387
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:21,433
- Hammer Ham?

388
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:25,200
He was the best boxer
  that ever was, real champ.

389
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:28,833
- Thank you, mister.

390
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:30,300
- Only he once had the bad luck

391
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,899
to kill another fighter in
 the ring with a straight left.

392
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:34,899
Pa!

393
00:26:34,899 --> 00:26:36,266
And the man was dead.

394
00:26:36,266 --> 00:26:37,766
- No, mister.

395
00:26:37,766 --> 00:26:38,866
With a right hook!

396
00:26:38,866 --> 00:26:39,799
- Huh?

397
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:41,300
What makes you so damn sure?

398
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,233
- Because it was this right
 hand that did it, mister.

399
00:26:43,233 --> 00:26:44,066
- What?

400
00:26:44,066 --> 00:26:44,899
(laughs)

401
00:26:44,899 --> 00:26:46,966
You, you're Hammer Ham?

402
00:26:46,966 --> 00:26:50,166
Man, you're making fun of
  a old seaman, aren't you?

403
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:51,632
- I can prove it, mister.

404
00:26:51,632 --> 00:26:55,200
- Mister, Hammer Ham,
 that's the real one,

405
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,999
would've busted the wooden
  barrel with good punch.

406
00:26:57,999 --> 00:26:59,566
We can bet that you can't.

407
00:26:59,566 --> 00:27:01,699
A barrel just like
 that one right there.

408
00:27:03,266 --> 00:27:06,666
- Woody now, wanna
 bet I can do it too?

409
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:12,367
- [Brandy] Bragging, and
 you do it, I'll eat my hat.

410
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:23,166
- You saw me, mister.

411
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:24,233
- Hammer Ham.

412
00:27:25,233 --> 00:27:27,799
- [Man] He really is Hammer Ham.

413
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:28,632
- Why do you hide
 your hand in a sling?

414
00:27:29,866 --> 00:27:31,999
- Well, it's just
  because, you see,

415
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:34,333
if I don't hide my
 right hand in a sling,

416
00:27:35,233 --> 00:27:36,433
gonna kill else somebody else

417
00:27:36,433 --> 00:27:38,133
because when I give
 that right hook,

418
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:39,733
there's bound to be a corpse.

419
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:43,200
- Hey, what happened here?

420
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:46,966
- He just opened a
 new barrel of whiskey.

421
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:47,833
You wanna taste?

422
00:27:49,566 --> 00:27:50,566
- [Man] Hey!

423
00:27:50,566 --> 00:27:51,400
Hey!

424
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,233
Deputy!

425
00:27:55,999 --> 00:27:57,166
- [Man] Hold him, hold him.

426
00:27:57,166 --> 00:27:58,300
- [Buffins] The transport.

427
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,133
- [Man] What happened?

428
00:27:59,133 --> 00:28:00,367
What happened?

429
00:28:00,367 --> 00:28:01,500
- The gold transport
 was attacked.

430
00:28:03,467 --> 00:28:08,200
I got away but the
 others, the others,

431
00:28:09,266 --> 00:28:12,632
the others are all dead.

432
00:28:12,632 --> 00:28:13,467
- Dead?

433
00:28:13,467 --> 00:28:14,899
- All dead.

434
00:28:14,899 --> 00:28:18,500
The sheriff and the
 other men, all dead.

435
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,599
- Give us a little water.

436
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:21,733
- All dead.

437
00:28:26,733 --> 00:28:27,566
- Rose!

438
00:28:29,533 --> 00:28:31,133
Someone attacked
 the gold transport.

439
00:28:33,666 --> 00:28:34,666
- My father.

440
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,899
- Buffins is the only one who.

441
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,133
- I knew it, I had a hunch.

442
00:28:45,133 --> 00:28:46,233
- A hunch?

443
00:28:46,233 --> 00:28:47,733
Maybe you had something
to do with it.

444
00:28:47,733 --> 00:28:49,433
- You damn fool, if I
was in cahoots with him,

445
00:28:49,433 --> 00:28:50,933
would I have sent my gold along?

446
00:28:50,933 --> 00:28:52,300
- Yeah, that's true enough.

447
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:55,699
- Yeah, but there's someone
 who didn't send his gold along

448
00:28:55,699 --> 00:28:56,899
like everyone else.

449
00:28:56,899 --> 00:28:58,133
- [Man] Yeah, the
 captain for instance.

450
00:28:58,133 --> 00:28:59,632
He still got his tugs away.

451
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:02,500
- [Brandy] What are
 you talking about?

452
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:06,500
- Listen, I have
  something to say.

453
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,033
- You have nothing to say here.

454
00:29:11,933 --> 00:29:16,933
- I believe I do since
  we've no longer a sheriff.

455
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:18,599
- What happened to my father?

456
00:29:22,033 --> 00:29:25,833
- He was, he was killed.

457
00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:33,833
(sobbing quietly)

458
00:29:40,766 --> 00:29:42,233
I won't need my badge now.

459
00:29:43,566 --> 00:29:46,300
No one will want me to
 be sheriff after this?

460
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,533
- What do you mean?

461
00:29:47,533 --> 00:29:48,999
I say Buffins should
 be appointed sheriff.

462
00:29:48,999 --> 00:29:49,933
- [Tinker] That's right.

463
00:29:49,933 --> 00:29:51,133
(men talking over each other)

464
00:29:51,133 --> 00:29:52,599
- Then I demand that
the new sheriff find out

465
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:55,966
who the murderers are and
 see the guilty come to trial.

466
00:29:55,966 --> 00:29:58,266
- Swear, I'll do everything
 in my power, Rose.

467
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:04,300
(mellow music)

468
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,933
- [Mark] Ho!

469
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,799
- What happened to Robbie?

470
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:26,632
- He's dead.

471
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:28,966
Take care of the youngster.

472
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:42,833
We'll bury him over there.

473
00:30:58,033 --> 00:30:59,300
What about him?

474
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,899
- I think that I can
 pull him through.

475
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:01,733
- [Mark] Good.

476
00:31:01,733 --> 00:31:02,799
- Are you crazy, Mark?

477
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,333
Let him die.

478
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:06,599
That little bastard's
 dangerous for us.

479
00:31:14,966 --> 00:31:16,799
- We'll save him, Doc.

480
00:31:19,233 --> 00:31:24,233
They took my brother and
gave me this little boy.

481
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:42,632
- Hoo, ya!

482
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,400
(speaking in foreign language)

483
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:56,500
Ho, ho.

484
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:02,333
(suspenseful music)

485
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,300
(Sanders screaming)

486
00:32:49,899 --> 00:32:52,933
(gunshot bangs)

487
00:32:52,933 --> 00:32:54,733
- [Don] Achua!

488
00:32:54,733 --> 00:32:57,100
- [Achua] White
 man, I can see you.

489
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,166
- I can only see a coward

490
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:02,133
who has tried to kill
 a defenseless man!

491
00:33:02,133 --> 00:33:06,266
Who does not have courage
  to fight a free man

492
00:33:06,266 --> 00:33:08,400
with his knife in his hand.

493
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,866
- Achua doesn't
 fight over a knife.

494
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,699
What do you want?

495
00:33:13,699 --> 00:33:14,733
- That man there.

496
00:33:14,733 --> 00:33:15,666
That man is mine.

497
00:33:16,533 --> 00:33:18,400
We'll fight over him.

498
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,033
That man is mine!

499
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:22,400
- Go ahead.

500
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,233
If you can defeat me,
 that man is yours.

501
00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:31,999
(suspenseful music)

502
00:33:47,033 --> 00:33:49,367
(grunting)

503
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,733
(grunting)

504
00:34:09,999 --> 00:34:12,233
(grunting)

505
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,533
(grunting)

506
00:34:32,467 --> 00:34:34,733
(grunting)

507
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,632
(grunting)

508
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,367
(grunting)

509
00:35:08,966 --> 00:35:09,833
Kill me.

510
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:10,666
- No!

511
00:35:11,733 --> 00:35:12,533
I won't kill.

512
00:35:13,433 --> 00:35:14,733
I just want your prisoner.

513
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,000
Does he belong to me?

514
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,999
- He belongs to you.

515
00:35:22,766 --> 00:35:24,999
(groaning)

516
00:35:36,632 --> 00:35:37,632
- Buck.

517
00:35:37,632 --> 00:35:38,467
Buck?

518
00:35:42,033 --> 00:35:42,833
Easy.

519
00:35:51,133 --> 00:35:53,966
Sanders, Sanders, they're gone.

520
00:35:53,966 --> 00:35:55,433
You'll be alright.

521
00:35:55,433 --> 00:35:57,766
I'll get my sled and take
  you to Paradise Creek.

522
00:35:58,766 --> 00:36:03,766
- I'm finished, Don.

523
00:36:04,632 --> 00:36:07,833
They burned me out first.

524
00:36:10,533 --> 00:36:12,933
That mine, everything's burned.

525
00:36:14,367 --> 00:36:15,233
What about Billy?

526
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,433
- Out.

527
00:36:18,433 --> 00:36:21,632
- Billy, put my
  claim in his name.

528
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,200
- I promise.

529
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,033
I promise.

530
00:36:26,066 --> 00:36:27,766
- Look after Billy.
 - I promise.

531
00:36:27,766 --> 00:36:28,966
- Thank you.

532
00:36:28,966 --> 00:36:30,966
Remember your promise.

533
00:36:31,933 --> 00:36:34,100
(gasping)

534
00:36:38,666 --> 00:36:40,300
(somber music)

535
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,866
(Buck whining)

536
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:57,367
- Lost a good friend,
 didn't you, Buck?

537
00:36:57,367 --> 00:36:58,200
I know.

538
00:37:03,066 --> 00:37:03,899
And Billy,

539
00:37:06,899 --> 00:37:11,899
we'll take care of him.

540
00:37:37,233 --> 00:37:38,066
- Mm?

541
00:37:39,733 --> 00:37:40,666
You feelin' better?

542
00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:47,066
Mark!

543
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:49,233
Mark!

544
00:37:52,133 --> 00:37:52,966
Mark!

545
00:38:02,233 --> 00:38:03,066
Mark!

546
00:38:03,066 --> 00:38:04,666
- What is it?

547
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:06,266
- The kid's awake!

548
00:38:06,266 --> 00:38:07,100
Come on.

549
00:38:09,566 --> 00:38:13,066
(mellow orchestral music)

550
00:38:24,566 --> 00:38:26,100
- How do you feel?

551
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,066
- I, where am I?

552
00:38:28,066 --> 00:38:30,033
- Well, what's your name?

553
00:38:30,033 --> 00:38:32,000
- I'm, I'm,

554
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,799
I've forgotten.

555
00:38:34,799 --> 00:38:35,632
I don't know.

556
00:38:39,799 --> 00:38:40,799
- [Mark] I'll move here.

557
00:38:43,632 --> 00:38:44,632
- Take it easy, kid.

558
00:38:45,632 --> 00:38:47,632
- I can't remember anything.

559
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,699
Where am I?

560
00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:53,666
- Just keep quiet.

561
00:39:07,233 --> 00:39:08,066
- Doctor.

562
00:39:09,866 --> 00:39:11,500
Now, what's he got?

563
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,533
- Dementia.

564
00:39:12,533 --> 00:39:14,300
- No medical terms.

565
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,632
- Happens very frequently,

566
00:39:15,632 --> 00:39:17,632
especially in cases
 of high temperature.

567
00:39:18,866 --> 00:39:20,933
- Lost his memory, that's good.

568
00:39:20,933 --> 00:39:22,566
What else?

569
00:39:22,566 --> 00:39:24,533
- Nothing else, but
I'll get him well again,

570
00:39:24,533 --> 00:39:25,833
just as soon as
  Lapporte gets here

571
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:27,500
with the medicine
  from Camp Keno.

572
00:39:32,632 --> 00:39:33,699
- Lost his memory?

573
00:39:45,266 --> 00:39:47,400
- We won't get our money
back with any poster.

574
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,233
I say we get it!

575
00:39:48,233 --> 00:39:49,266
- Captain Brandy?

576
00:39:49,266 --> 00:39:50,400
- Right.

577
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,599
I'm sure he knows plenty.

578
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,833
I say let's ask him
 a few questions.

579
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:54,300
(men clamoring)

580
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,699
- Tinker, that's enough of that.

581
00:39:56,699 --> 00:39:58,400
Stop stirring up trouble.

582
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,100
As long as I'm sheriff, I'm
 keeping order in this place.

583
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,166
- Yeah, why didn't you say that

584
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,766
to those murdering bandits, huh?

585
00:40:15,533 --> 00:40:18,500
- Miss Cotton, don't forget,

586
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,133
you're not the daughter of the
 sheriff from Camp Keno now.

587
00:40:22,266 --> 00:40:24,433
- Don't worry, I'm
 not stealing anything.

588
00:40:24,433 --> 00:40:26,433
This Colt belongs to my daddy,

589
00:40:26,433 --> 00:40:28,266
and I wish I could
  fire at the men

590
00:40:28,266 --> 00:40:30,100
who, in cold blood,
 killed my father.

591
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,666
- I understand how you feel

592
00:40:33,666 --> 00:40:35,200
but they just disappeared
  without a trace,

593
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,599
no wagon tracks, nothing.

594
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:37,966
- [Rose] Then I'm
 gonna keep on looking.

595
00:40:37,966 --> 00:40:40,133
- It can be very
dangerous, Rose.

596
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:42,433
You mustn't do anything
without asking me.

597
00:40:42,433 --> 00:40:45,433
- Since there are no men in
Camp Keno to avenge his murder,

598
00:40:45,433 --> 00:40:46,766
then I have to do it alone.

599
00:40:50,766 --> 00:40:51,766
- Yes, Buck.

600
00:40:52,666 --> 00:40:53,933
I know, I know.

601
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:56,899
We'll find Billy.

602
00:40:56,899 --> 00:40:57,733
We'll find him.

603
00:40:58,632 --> 00:41:01,166
We'll find him.

604
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:04,166
(soft mellow music)

605
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:09,666
- [Shat] Boo.

606
00:41:11,632 --> 00:41:12,433
- Thanks, Shat.

607
00:41:15,933 --> 00:41:16,933
It's alright.

608
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:18,433
I understand you.

609
00:41:19,733 --> 00:41:21,467
You've been alone so long here.

610
00:41:21,467 --> 00:41:22,467
Forgot how to talk.

611
00:41:26,433 --> 00:41:30,033
See you.

612
00:41:30,033 --> 00:41:31,033
(Buck barking)

613
00:41:31,033 --> 00:41:32,200
Come on, Buck.

614
00:41:34,632 --> 00:41:38,567
(melancholic orchestral music)

615
00:41:49,866 --> 00:41:51,400
- [Rose] Halt.

616
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,632
Hands up.

617
00:41:52,632 --> 00:41:53,599
Don't try anything.

618
00:41:57,966 --> 00:42:01,033
- Rose, it's Don, don't shoot.

619
00:42:01,033 --> 00:42:03,400
I'd give myself up
  without a fight.

620
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,233
- [Rose] Don!

621
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,433
- [Don] What are you
 doing out here, Rose?

622
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:18,100
- They shot my father
 and the other men

623
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,200
who were with him on
 the gold transport.

624
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,100
The only one who got
 away was Buffins.

625
00:42:24,066 --> 00:42:24,966
- I'm sorry, Rose.

626
00:42:26,666 --> 00:42:28,033
Did they get the men who did it?

627
00:42:28,033 --> 00:42:28,866
- No.

628
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:32,500
- I only count five graves.

629
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,133
What about the kid?

630
00:42:34,133 --> 00:42:35,866
- There was no kid.

631
00:42:35,866 --> 00:42:37,733
I was there when
 they buried the men.

632
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,233
- Rose, I gave your father a
 boy to take along with him.

633
00:42:42,233 --> 00:42:44,367
His name was Billy Sanders.

634
00:42:44,367 --> 00:42:45,632
It's either he escaped

635
00:42:45,632 --> 00:42:47,333
or still with the
  men who did this.

636
00:42:47,333 --> 00:42:48,567
Where's the deputy sheriff?

637
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:49,766
- Buffins?

638
00:42:49,766 --> 00:42:51,999
He's now the sheriff
 of Camp Keno.

639
00:42:51,999 --> 00:42:53,133
- I wanna talk to him.

640
00:42:53,133 --> 00:42:55,066
If we find Billy Sanders,

641
00:42:55,066 --> 00:42:56,799
we'll find the men who
 killed your father.

642
00:42:56,799 --> 00:42:58,400
- Mm-hmm.

643
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,567
- Oh, listen, I know
 everything again.

644
00:43:00,567 --> 00:43:01,632
I know my name.

645
00:43:01,632 --> 00:43:03,467
I know who my father is.

646
00:43:03,467 --> 00:43:05,500
We've got a mine
  in the mountains.

647
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,400
- The boy, hey!

648
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,866
- What's the new idea
 with that new get-up?

649
00:43:13,866 --> 00:43:15,300
What did you pay for it with?

650
00:43:16,433 --> 00:43:17,833
- Where's the nuggets, boss?

651
00:43:19,033 --> 00:43:21,333
I told them how we
  did just get rich.

652
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:22,799
- You idiot, why now?

653
00:43:22,799 --> 00:43:24,433
It's too soon after the
 raid on the gold transport.

654
00:43:24,433 --> 00:43:25,632
They'll put two and two together

655
00:43:25,632 --> 00:43:27,300
and figure out our plan.

656
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,833
- [Lapporte] They ain't
that smart around here.

657
00:43:28,833 --> 00:43:31,833
And Buffins has agreed we
  are to get rid of the kid.

658
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:33,166
- Buffins?

659
00:43:33,166 --> 00:43:34,567
Buffins hasn't anything to say.

660
00:43:34,567 --> 00:43:35,866
That's my business.

661
00:43:35,866 --> 00:43:37,666
- Did you bring the stuff?

662
00:43:38,799 --> 00:43:40,333
- [Lapporte] But I wanna
tell you something.

663
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:42,733
That kid's dangerous for us
 when he starts remembering.

664
00:43:42,733 --> 00:43:44,166
- [Mark] That aint
 likely to happen soon

665
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:45,733
according to what
  the doctor said.

666
00:43:45,733 --> 00:43:48,367
He won't remember anything
  for quite a while.

667
00:43:48,367 --> 00:43:49,567
- [Lapporte] And another thing,

668
00:43:49,567 --> 00:43:50,833
that kid's got
  parents somewhere.

669
00:43:50,833 --> 00:43:52,266
They'll be looking for him.

670
00:43:52,266 --> 00:43:54,133
- [Mark] And by then, we'll
 be far away, Lapporte.

671
00:43:54,133 --> 00:43:55,999
- [Lapporte] I don't care, I
 believe in playing it safe.

672
00:43:55,999 --> 00:43:58,333
And the safest way
 is to get rid of him.

673
00:43:58,333 --> 00:44:00,133
- [Mark] Shut up, that
 kid might hear you.

674
00:44:02,433 --> 00:44:05,033
- Hey kid, how do you feel?

675
00:44:07,133 --> 00:44:08,567
I see we're wide awake.

676
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:13,166
So, there's our little man.

677
00:44:15,533 --> 00:44:16,367
What's your name?

678
00:44:19,266 --> 00:44:20,433
What's your name?

679
00:44:20,433 --> 00:44:21,233
- Bill.

680
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,666
- Why don't you
 wanna tell us, kid?

681
00:44:26,666 --> 00:44:27,933
- I don't remember, sir.

682
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:29,933
My head is empty.

683
00:44:31,567 --> 00:44:33,766
Can't remember anything.

684
00:44:33,766 --> 00:44:35,467
- He's lost his
  memory, you idiot.

685
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,666
I'll tell you who you are.

686
00:44:40,666 --> 00:44:41,500
You're Robbie.

687
00:44:42,866 --> 00:44:44,567
Robert Monty.

688
00:44:46,933 --> 00:44:48,433
- Robert Monty.

689
00:44:57,367 --> 00:45:00,367
- Believe me, men, I know
  what I'm talking about.

690
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:02,033
Jason, you lost all your savings

691
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:03,699
when the gold transport
was held up, didn't you?

692
00:45:03,699 --> 00:45:05,133
- Sure, lost every cent.

693
00:45:05,133 --> 00:45:06,866
Why, can you get it back?

694
00:45:06,866 --> 00:45:07,733
- [Tinker] Possible.

695
00:45:10,733 --> 00:45:11,899
- You know where it is?

696
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:14,266
- Yeah, it's in the safe
  in Captain Brandy's house.

697
00:45:14,266 --> 00:45:15,200
- Then let's go get them.

698
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,899
- Wait a minute, take it easy.

699
00:45:16,899 --> 00:45:18,266
It's in Captain
 Brandy's safe alright

700
00:45:18,266 --> 00:45:20,266
but in the backroom
 on the first floor.

701
00:45:20,266 --> 00:45:23,266
We gotta get the key
or break the safe open.

702
00:45:23,266 --> 00:45:26,300
Go get your hammer.

703
00:45:32,866 --> 00:45:33,933
- I'm sorry, Captain.

704
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,400
- [Betty] What's the matter?

705
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,833
- I'm skippin' out.

706
00:45:37,833 --> 00:45:39,699
- You're so afraid
they've got you shaking

707
00:45:39,699 --> 00:45:42,666
in your pants just because
 of that troublemaker, Tinker.

708
00:45:42,666 --> 00:45:44,300
- Well, there's
 talk going on around

709
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,866
that you had some connection
 with the transport attack.

710
00:45:46,866 --> 00:45:49,166
- That's a lot of stupid joke.

711
00:45:49,166 --> 00:45:51,632
- It's gonna get hot and
I don't wanna get holes

712
00:45:51,632 --> 00:45:54,200
in my skin where
  they don't belong.

713
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,866
- Whom will you rats?

714
00:45:55,866 --> 00:45:57,166
That sort of sinking ship?

715
00:45:58,666 --> 00:46:00,133
Pay them what we owe him, Betty

716
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:02,033
and throw that
 coward off our boat.

717
00:46:02,033 --> 00:46:02,866
- Right!

718
00:46:02,866 --> 00:46:04,100
- Captain!

719
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,699
I'll tell you a
  tornado is blowing

720
00:46:05,699 --> 00:46:07,533
and it's about to
 blast through here.

721
00:46:11,266 --> 00:46:12,100
- Oh!

722
00:46:16,066 --> 00:46:18,066
(gasps)

723
00:46:20,766 --> 00:46:22,200
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

724
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,899
Is there anything special
  you'd like to drink?

725
00:46:23,899 --> 00:46:26,933
- We came for something else
besides that rock out of yours.

726
00:46:26,933 --> 00:46:28,433
We came here to get our gold.

727
00:46:28,433 --> 00:46:30,467
- But this is a
 saloon, not a bank.

728
00:46:30,467 --> 00:46:32,666
- We'll settle accounts
with you later, Betty.

729
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:34,866
But first, we'll settle
up with the captain.

730
00:46:34,866 --> 00:46:36,300
- Mutiny!

731
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,666
I'll have you shrunk
 from a mat by a heat.

732
00:46:38,666 --> 00:46:41,100
- You're gonna hand over
  your share of that money.

733
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,066
Where have you got it hidden?

734
00:46:42,066 --> 00:46:42,899
In a safe?

735
00:46:43,899 --> 00:46:45,632
- Listen, now, stop it!

736
00:46:45,632 --> 00:46:46,599
- [Tinker] Jason, the hammer.

737
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:47,799
- [Betty] Oh!

738
00:46:47,799 --> 00:46:48,733
- [Brandy] Beat them
 with a law, son.

739
00:46:48,733 --> 00:46:51,333
Get this bastard 15 lashes.

740
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:52,166
Idiots.

741
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:58,300
Get down from the
command breach, hold it!

742
00:46:59,033 --> 00:47:01,300
(punches thudding)

743
00:47:12,367 --> 00:47:17,367
(punches thudding)
  (grunting)

744
00:47:18,799 --> 00:47:21,367
(mellow music)

745
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:27,833
- [Betty] Where's the sheriff?

746
00:47:27,833 --> 00:47:30,166
Hurry, they're gonna
 kill the captain.

747
00:47:30,166 --> 00:47:31,266
- Rose, go get him.

748
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:32,367
Buck, stay there.

749
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,733
(men grunting)
  (punches thudding)

750
00:47:43,733 --> 00:47:45,533
Hey, my name's Don.

751
00:47:47,733 --> 00:47:48,567
Who are you?

752
00:47:51,433 --> 00:47:54,333
(punches thudding)

753
00:47:56,166 --> 00:47:57,467
- There!

754
00:47:57,467 --> 00:47:59,266
(giggles)

755
00:47:59,266 --> 00:48:00,166
- [Don] Huh?

756
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:01,533
- [Ham] My name's Ham.

757
00:48:01,533 --> 00:48:03,632
(grunts)

758
00:48:06,733 --> 00:48:09,899
(punches thudding)

759
00:48:09,899 --> 00:48:11,500
- [Don] Huh?

760
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,666
Outta here.

761
00:48:12,666 --> 00:48:13,500
- There!

762
00:48:21,966 --> 00:48:24,799
- Give me the key to the
safe, you damn drunk.

763
00:48:24,799 --> 00:48:26,833
- [Brandy] All hands on deck!

764
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:28,966
All hands on deck!

765
00:48:28,966 --> 00:48:30,400
Puny villain!

766
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,233
Hold me the keys!

767
00:48:31,233 --> 00:48:32,066
- Help!

768
00:48:32,066 --> 00:48:33,233
Help!

769
00:48:33,233 --> 00:48:34,666
The captain, come up stairs.

770
00:48:34,666 --> 00:48:37,533
Tinker's gonna kill him!
- What?

771
00:48:37,533 --> 00:48:39,866
- Hold them!
- He needs help.

772
00:48:41,999 --> 00:48:43,966
- [Brandy] Stop it!

773
00:48:43,966 --> 00:48:47,166
- [Don] Here, you guys (grunts).

774
00:48:47,166 --> 00:48:48,300
- [Brandy] Gracious, help me!

775
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,133
Help me!

776
00:48:52,467 --> 00:48:54,966
(punch thuds)

777
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:01,933
- Alright.

778
00:49:03,166 --> 00:49:05,400
(grunting)

779
00:49:09,166 --> 00:49:11,233
(Betty gasps)

780
00:49:11,233 --> 00:49:13,500
(grunting)

781
00:49:19,632 --> 00:49:24,632
(punches thudding)
  (grunting)

782
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:36,100
(punches thudding)
  (grunting)

783
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:51,567
(grunting)

784
00:49:54,467 --> 00:49:59,467
(punches thudding)
  (grunting)

785
00:50:12,699 --> 00:50:14,033
(gunshot bangs)

786
00:50:14,033 --> 00:50:15,133
- [Buffins] Hey, are you crazy?

787
00:50:15,133 --> 00:50:16,733
What's going on, Betty?

788
00:50:16,733 --> 00:50:17,699
- How should I know?

789
00:50:17,699 --> 00:50:18,833
Ask Tinker.

790
00:50:18,833 --> 00:50:21,100
He's the one who started this.

791
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,333
- What happened, Tinker?

792
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:23,599
- Nothing.

793
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:24,966
We was just letting
 off a bit of steam.

794
00:50:24,966 --> 00:50:26,200
(scoffs)

795
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,632
- It would've been
  a lot of steam.

796
00:50:27,632 --> 00:50:29,200
If Don Rutland hadn't come,

797
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,666
it would've been much worse.

798
00:50:31,666 --> 00:50:33,899
- Oh, thank you
  very much mister--

799
00:50:33,899 --> 00:50:34,899
- Rutland.

800
00:50:34,899 --> 00:50:36,166
- Oh, Rutland.
 - Don Rutland.

801
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,666
- Our fellows are a
 little bit nervous

802
00:50:38,666 --> 00:50:41,300
over the attack on
 the gold transport.

803
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,166
- I wanna talk to
  you about that.

804
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:44,599
- You know anything about it?

805
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:45,866
- Maybe.

806
00:50:45,866 --> 00:50:46,833
- Oh then, let's go
 talk in my office.

807
00:50:46,833 --> 00:50:47,666
- Don.

808
00:50:49,367 --> 00:50:52,266
Thanks a lot.

809
00:50:52,266 --> 00:50:54,533
(laughing)

810
00:50:54,533 --> 00:50:55,500
- Thank you!

811
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,833
The fighter I had in years.

812
00:51:07,066 --> 00:51:08,632
(brooding music)

813
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:09,467
- [Man] Alright.

814
00:51:09,467 --> 00:51:11,400
What are you doing?

815
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,400
Now, what's the problem.

816
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,632
Right, who doesn't like a
 good drink after a good fight?

817
00:51:18,632 --> 00:51:20,766
- [Man] There ain't
 no fighter in you.

818
00:51:20,766 --> 00:51:22,999
(laughing)

819
00:51:24,233 --> 00:51:25,200
- Secure the ship.

820
00:51:26,367 --> 00:51:30,100
Hand around the whiskey
for the whole crew!

821
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,933
(men celebrating)

822
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,866
(laughing)

823
00:51:40,567 --> 00:51:42,166
- Captain, your face!

824
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:45,066
I better get you some iodine.

825
00:51:45,066 --> 00:51:46,733
- Where are you going?

826
00:51:46,733 --> 00:51:49,333
We're having one
hell of a party.

827
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:51,599
(laughing)

828
00:51:52,933 --> 00:51:55,100
My kind of iodine.

829
00:51:56,233 --> 00:51:58,500
(laughing)

830
00:52:02,166 --> 00:52:04,033
- You mean you tell me
 you gave Cotton a kid

831
00:52:04,033 --> 00:52:06,699
by the name of Billy
 Sanders at Lonesome Corner.

832
00:52:06,699 --> 00:52:07,533
- That's right.

833
00:52:08,699 --> 00:52:10,166
- And what are you
  going to do now?

834
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,333
- I'm gonna look
  for Billy Sanders.

835
00:52:14,899 --> 00:52:16,166
- I'm sorry to tell you,

836
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:17,899
we didn't find even
 the slightest trace.

837
00:52:17,899 --> 00:52:20,166
- But I found that.

838
00:52:24,666 --> 00:52:27,966
Billy Sander's father
  gave me this bag of gold.

839
00:52:27,966 --> 00:52:29,266
It weighs about 10 ounces.

840
00:52:30,533 --> 00:52:31,699
I gave it to Sheriff Cotton.

841
00:52:31,699 --> 00:52:33,166
Cotton is dead.

842
00:52:33,166 --> 00:52:34,899
Now, one of the murderers
  lost it in the saloon.

843
00:52:34,899 --> 00:52:37,367
- And I'm supposed to
 believe you, Rutland?

844
00:52:37,367 --> 00:52:38,899
- You believe what you want.

845
00:52:38,899 --> 00:52:40,866
But I know at least one of
  the killers of Bear Path

846
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,400
is here in Camp Keno.

847
00:52:43,632 --> 00:52:46,166
- But you, you're also here.

848
00:52:48,033 --> 00:52:49,833
- Billy Sander's father is dead.

849
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,400
And this gold belongs to Billy.

850
00:52:52,567 --> 00:52:53,933
And I'm gonna find him.

851
00:52:59,133 --> 00:53:00,733
You see, I figured it.

852
00:53:02,799 --> 00:53:04,866
One of them lost this pouch.

853
00:53:04,866 --> 00:53:06,599
The pouch I gave your father.

854
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:07,766
- [Rose] But who?

855
00:53:07,766 --> 00:53:08,599
- Who?

856
00:53:13,467 --> 00:53:14,333
I don't know yet.

857
00:53:18,799 --> 00:53:19,632
- [Rose] What's wrong?

858
00:53:19,632 --> 00:53:20,467
- Buffins.

859
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,400
He's riding away.

860
00:53:32,266 --> 00:53:33,833
- [Rose] I wonder
 where he's heading.

861
00:53:33,833 --> 00:53:34,833
- Maybe he's
 delivering a message.

862
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:35,866
- [Rose] Seems to be in a hurry.

863
00:53:35,866 --> 00:53:36,699
- Yeah.

864
00:53:39,533 --> 00:53:40,367
Message for whom?

865
00:53:40,367 --> 00:53:41,200
- Don, I'm afraid.

866
00:53:43,533 --> 00:53:45,066
- You needn't be afraid for me.

867
00:53:45,066 --> 00:53:46,367
I can take care of myself.

868
00:53:47,999 --> 00:53:49,899
It's the others who
 have to be afraid.

869
00:53:52,666 --> 00:53:56,866
Sit down.

870
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:58,866
I haven't any proof
 Buffins is involved.

871
00:53:59,799 --> 00:54:01,400
At least not yet.

872
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:06,033
But I do know that
 one of the murderers

873
00:54:06,033 --> 00:54:07,833
is here in Camp Keno.

874
00:54:07,833 --> 00:54:10,866
And I promise, I promise
you, I'll find him.

875
00:54:10,866 --> 00:54:15,066
- It ain't a palace
 but it should do.

876
00:54:15,066 --> 00:54:16,333
See for yourself.

877
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:17,733
It's the finest room
 in the whole hotel.

878
00:54:19,933 --> 00:54:21,666
Yeah, just take a
  look at that view.

879
00:54:21,666 --> 00:54:23,333
And a real bargain
  for the money.

880
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:25,699
- [Don] Yeah.

881
00:54:25,699 --> 00:54:27,400
- There ain't no more
 comfortable bed in all Alaska.

882
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,233
Fit for a king.

883
00:54:34,033 --> 00:54:34,866
Well.

884
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,966
And you can't find
  fresher eggs for breakfast

885
00:54:38,966 --> 00:54:40,699
than right here in Camp Keno.

886
00:54:43,733 --> 00:54:44,766
Fine.

887
00:54:44,766 --> 00:54:45,699
The rooms is yours.

888
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:51,833
But you have to pay $5 and
  what's more in advance.

889
00:54:51,833 --> 00:54:52,666
- Yeah.

890
00:54:54,367 --> 00:54:56,033
- Well, come on.

891
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:01,400
(laughs)

892
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,567
Thank you.

893
00:55:02,567 --> 00:55:04,066
I promise you,
 you'll sleep in here

894
00:55:04,066 --> 00:55:06,200
just like a newborn
 baby in a cradle.

895
00:55:07,433 --> 00:55:09,699
Alright, alright, I know
that I'm not wanted.

896
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:11,666
So long, buddy.

897
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:15,500
See you gentlemen.

898
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:22,166
(sniggers)

899
00:55:27,266 --> 00:55:31,567
- Well, Buck, what do you think?

900
00:55:31,567 --> 00:55:32,400
Home.

901
00:55:52,632 --> 00:55:55,233
(Buck whining)

902
00:56:12,233 --> 00:56:14,333
(hushes)

903
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:28,567
Don't you make a.

904
00:56:28,567 --> 00:56:30,467
(Buck barking)

905
00:56:30,467 --> 00:56:31,599
Buck, Ham, I.

906
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:34,367
- Is that the way you
 greet your friend?

907
00:56:34,367 --> 00:56:37,966
- I'm sorry, Ham, I
  wasn't expecting a friend.

908
00:56:37,966 --> 00:56:38,799
- I'm your friend.

909
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:40,266
- I know.

910
00:56:40,266 --> 00:56:41,133
- I just came to tell
  who lost the bag of gold.

911
00:56:41,133 --> 00:56:42,666
- Who?

912
00:56:42,666 --> 00:56:43,966
- Buffins, I just saw him.

913
00:56:45,133 --> 00:56:45,966
- I thought so.

914
00:56:48,966 --> 00:56:50,766
- What about the bag?

915
00:56:50,766 --> 00:56:53,833
- Gold, rotten gold.

916
00:56:53,833 --> 00:56:54,999
- From the gold transport?

917
00:56:54,999 --> 00:56:55,833
- Yeah.

918
00:56:57,733 --> 00:56:59,400
- What can I do to help you?

919
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,999
- Ham, we gonna keep
 an eye on Buffins.

920
00:57:01,999 --> 00:57:04,133
And make him a little nervous.

921
00:57:04,133 --> 00:57:05,733
- I'll make him
  nervous, alright.

922
00:57:12,367 --> 00:57:14,766
(gun clicks)

923
00:57:16,033 --> 00:57:19,367
(hoofbeats approaching)

924
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:28,333
- [Lapporte] Hey Mark!

925
00:57:28,333 --> 00:57:29,266
- [Mark] Huh?

926
00:57:29,266 --> 00:57:30,000
- [Lapporte] Someone's coming.

927
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:34,200
- [Mark] What?

928
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:39,033
(Buffins yelling)

929
00:57:40,966 --> 00:57:42,467
What's the matter?

930
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,966
You got in trouble?

931
00:57:49,033 --> 00:57:52,467
- There's a guy named
 Don Rutland in town.

932
00:57:53,632 --> 00:57:57,567
He's looking for a
 kid, Billy Sanders.

933
00:57:57,567 --> 00:57:58,899
- His name is Robert Monty.

934
00:58:01,666 --> 00:58:03,699
Who is this Don Rutland?

935
00:58:03,699 --> 00:58:04,999
- [Buffins] A fur trapper.

936
00:58:04,999 --> 00:58:07,133
But he could become a problem.

937
00:58:07,133 --> 00:58:10,133
By the way, Billy's, er,
Robert's father is dead.

938
00:58:11,799 --> 00:58:12,632
- That's good.

939
00:58:14,433 --> 00:58:15,367
What about Rutland?

940
00:58:16,266 --> 00:58:19,933
- Kill him.

941
00:58:19,933 --> 00:58:21,033
- And real legal-like.

942
00:58:22,766 --> 00:58:24,400
Just like we do everything.

943
00:58:26,066 --> 00:58:26,899
Wait a minute.

944
00:58:29,833 --> 00:58:31,500
- [Buffins] Have you
 got anything to drink?

945
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:35,766
- [Lapporte] Take it.

946
00:58:42,733 --> 00:58:44,966
- You gonna kill the
 people in Camp Keno

947
00:58:44,966 --> 00:58:47,899
that Rutland was the one who
 attacked the gold transport.

948
00:58:49,133 --> 00:58:52,166
Then you'll arrest him
 and put him into jail.

949
00:58:52,166 --> 00:58:54,933
Give him a chance to escape
 and then when he does,

950
00:58:55,966 --> 00:58:56,966
you could shoot him.

951
00:58:58,467 --> 00:59:00,666
You better practice your
aim so you don't miss.

952
00:59:02,833 --> 00:59:03,666
- Okay.

953
00:59:09,966 --> 00:59:12,367
- Well, now we've had it.

954
00:59:13,699 --> 00:59:15,300
Just because of that damn kid.

955
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:16,467
- Shut up.

956
00:59:16,467 --> 00:59:18,699
What you did is 10 times worse.

957
00:59:18,699 --> 00:59:21,200
Because of you, we've
 gotta play our bonanza game

958
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,500
earlier than we wanted to.

959
00:59:23,966 --> 00:59:25,166
- The sheriff?

960
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,433
- Yeah, the sheriff, Buffins.

961
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,433
They won't believe Ham.

962
00:59:34,933 --> 00:59:36,033
He's just a black man.

963
00:59:37,766 --> 00:59:39,999
They won't believe in him.

964
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:49,400
Well, now I know
who my enemy is.

965
00:59:51,333 --> 00:59:52,233
And I am a hunter.

966
00:59:53,133 --> 00:59:54,533
We've got to find Billy.

967
00:59:54,533 --> 00:59:55,333
- [Rose] Yes.

968
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,699
- Will you help me?

969
00:59:57,699 --> 00:59:58,533
- Yes, darling.

970
00:59:58,533 --> 01:00:02,567
You know I will.

971
01:00:02,567 --> 01:00:03,533
- [Buffins] Ho, ho!

972
01:00:17,833 --> 01:00:18,666
Well.

973
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:22,033
What are you doing here?

974
01:00:22,033 --> 01:00:23,567
- I'm looking for you, sheriff.

975
01:00:25,066 --> 01:00:28,500
How could you leave lovely
  Camp Keno unguarded.

976
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,100
- Ah, I was looking
 for the little kid.

977
01:00:32,567 --> 01:00:34,200
You know, Billy Sanders.

978
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,433
Ain't that what you wanted?

979
01:00:35,433 --> 01:00:36,699
- [Don] And?

980
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:38,300
- Nothing.

981
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:39,300
Absolutely nothing.

982
01:00:40,567 --> 01:00:42,133
- Can I give you a little tip?

983
01:00:42,133 --> 01:00:43,666
- [Buffins] Go on.

984
01:00:43,666 --> 01:00:46,933
- I know for a fact that one
 of the murderers in Bear Creek

985
01:00:46,933 --> 01:00:48,233
is here at Camp Keno.

986
01:00:49,733 --> 01:00:51,500
But don't tell anyone.

987
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,400
- I'm warning you.

988
01:00:53,367 --> 01:00:54,533
If you make a false accusation--

989
01:00:54,533 --> 01:00:55,833
- No, no.

990
01:00:55,833 --> 01:00:58,066
I wouldn't accuse anyone
without definite proof.

991
01:00:59,133 --> 01:01:00,233
But you could help me.

992
01:01:00,233 --> 01:01:01,833
You are the sheriff.

993
01:01:01,833 --> 01:01:03,300
You should investigate,

994
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:05,433
cross-examine each
everyone of these people

995
01:01:06,766 --> 01:01:08,699
until you have the
  murderer, you understand?

996
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,066
You'll have them trapped.

997
01:01:17,933 --> 01:01:21,066
Oh, I'll be around again.

998
01:01:30,233 --> 01:01:32,333
- Hello, I was wondering
if you could help me.

999
01:01:32,333 --> 01:01:35,666
Has anyone seen a young
boy about 10 years old?

1000
01:01:35,666 --> 01:01:37,200
His name is Billy Sanders.

1001
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,567
- [Man] No, I haven't seen
  any youngster around here.

1002
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:46,733
- You're good men, I'm gonna
 appoint you my deputies.

1003
01:01:49,933 --> 01:01:50,766
Tinker.

1004
01:01:54,133 --> 01:01:54,966
- [Tinker] Thank you.

1005
01:01:54,966 --> 01:01:56,533
- [Buffins] My pleasure.

1006
01:01:56,533 --> 01:01:59,166
- [Frank] We'll do our
 best for you, Buffins.

1007
01:01:59,166 --> 01:02:00,899
- [Tinker] Yeah, I'll
 promise you that.

1008
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:03,966
- I think we're
 gonna have company.

1009
01:02:03,966 --> 01:02:04,799
- Yeah, who?

1010
01:02:05,766 --> 01:02:07,200
- Don Rutland.

1011
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,166
The guy's been snooping
 around and I don't like that.

1012
01:02:15,166 --> 01:02:15,999
Oh, Mr. Rutland.

1013
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,600
What gives me the honor?

1014
01:02:22,632 --> 01:02:24,567
- Billy Sanders, I
  was just curious.

1015
01:02:25,666 --> 01:02:27,133
Did you find out anything?

1016
01:02:27,133 --> 01:02:28,500
You know where he might be?

1017
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,899
- I don't know anything yet.

1018
01:02:30,766 --> 01:02:32,899
But I'll know something soon.

1019
01:02:32,899 --> 01:02:36,333
I and my deputies here are
  gonna search every house.

1020
01:02:36,333 --> 01:02:39,400
And when I catch the
 murderer, better watch out.

1021
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,367
(gunshots bang)

1022
01:02:40,367 --> 01:02:41,200
- [Mark] Bonanza!

1023
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,367
Go, bonanza, bonanza!

1024
01:02:44,166 --> 01:02:45,367
- [Townsman] What's going on?

1025
01:02:45,367 --> 01:02:46,600
What's the shout for?

1026
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,400
- [Mark] We found
 gold on our finders!

1027
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,766
Gold in our mines!

1028
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:50,600
- [Townsman] Really?

1029
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,567
When to strike?

1030
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:52,899
- [Mark] Right now, bonanza!

1031
01:02:54,333 --> 01:02:55,400
Alright, everybody!

1032
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:58,500
Let's go and celebrate!

1033
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:59,733
In my mine, everybody's great.

1034
01:02:59,733 --> 01:03:03,033
The whole town is
 invited, you hear me?

1035
01:03:03,033 --> 01:03:04,966
The whole town.

1036
01:03:04,966 --> 01:03:07,533
Alright, everybody,
 into the saloon.

1037
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:08,367
Come on.

1038
01:03:10,166 --> 01:03:12,766
(men laughing)

1039
01:03:19,733 --> 01:03:21,033
- Might as well go have a drink.

1040
01:03:21,033 --> 01:03:22,933
It's free.
 - Oh no no, you don't, Tinker.

1041
01:03:22,933 --> 01:03:24,567
No drinking while
  in you're duty.

1042
01:03:25,433 --> 01:03:26,933
Go search the houses there.

1043
01:03:26,933 --> 01:03:27,966
I'll check the hotel.

1044
01:03:30,166 --> 01:03:30,999
- [Man] Let's go there!

1045
01:03:30,999 --> 01:03:32,899
There's gold in there!.

1046
01:03:39,066 --> 01:03:43,999
(excited townsmen
talking over each other)

1047
01:04:01,899 --> 01:04:03,533
- Hello!
  - Hello, captain.

1048
01:04:03,533 --> 01:04:04,632
- Hello, Don.

1049
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:07,699
Glad to see you.

1050
01:04:07,699 --> 01:04:09,033
Come on, have a drink.

1051
01:04:09,033 --> 01:04:10,100
No, no, you have a
 drink for both of us.

1052
01:04:11,367 --> 01:04:14,200
(men celebrating)

1053
01:04:17,799 --> 01:04:18,966
- Hello there.

1054
01:04:20,166 --> 01:04:22,400
Something like hella lumba.

1055
01:04:23,866 --> 01:04:25,000
Another drink!

1056
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:25,833
Ai, a drink hey!

1057
01:04:27,467 --> 01:04:28,333
A drink here!

1058
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,433
- Congratulations.

1059
01:04:31,433 --> 01:04:32,632
- Thank you.

1060
01:04:32,632 --> 01:04:34,100
Thank you.

1061
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:35,133
Have a drink for you.

1062
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,833
Come on, let's have a drink!

1063
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:40,066
- Congratulations.

1064
01:04:40,066 --> 01:04:42,200
Gold, he found gold.

1065
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,866
- You look a little pale!

1066
01:04:44,866 --> 01:04:46,966
(men laughing)

1067
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:49,100
- Listen, listen to me.

1068
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:50,400
- Yeah.

1069
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,133
- I never found gold.

1070
01:04:52,133 --> 01:04:53,766
- Here have a drink.

1071
01:04:53,766 --> 01:04:54,833
That's right.

1072
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:56,166
- Excuse me, mister.

1073
01:04:56,166 --> 01:04:57,400
I never found gold.

1074
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,999
- Nevermind, me, I found it!

1075
01:04:59,999 --> 01:05:01,233
I did!
 - I never did.

1076
01:05:01,233 --> 01:05:03,400
But I wonder, I wonder.

1077
01:05:05,033 --> 01:05:05,899
I was wondering,

1078
01:05:05,899 --> 01:05:07,100
I lost a boy.

1079
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:09,066
- Yeah, you like it?
 - A boy, a boy.

1080
01:05:09,066 --> 01:05:11,166
His name is, it's Billy Sanders.

1081
01:05:12,333 --> 01:05:13,866
Did you happen to
  run across him?

1082
01:05:14,833 --> 01:05:16,500
- Boy named Billy Sanders?

1083
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:19,500
- Yeah, about that high.

1084
01:05:21,433 --> 01:05:22,766
- No.

1085
01:05:22,766 --> 01:05:24,699
I never heard the name.

1086
01:05:24,699 --> 01:05:26,567
I found gold!

1087
01:05:26,567 --> 01:05:28,333
A bonanza, mister.

1088
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,467
Mister, ah?

1089
01:05:30,467 --> 01:05:31,400
- Rutland, Rutland.

1090
01:05:33,433 --> 01:05:34,266
- Mr. Rutland?

1091
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,400
I never heard about you.

1092
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,033
Doesn't matter.

1093
01:05:39,033 --> 01:05:40,033
You're my friend.

1094
01:05:40,933 --> 01:05:42,632
Come on, get my friend a drink.

1095
01:05:48,567 --> 01:05:50,400
- [Buffins] Well
  what did you find?

1096
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,799
- Nothing.

1097
01:05:51,799 --> 01:05:53,333
- [Tinker] Now, we searched
 every place in town.

1098
01:05:53,333 --> 01:05:55,367
- Just gotta keep looking.

1099
01:05:55,367 --> 01:05:56,200
Let's go.

1100
01:06:05,899 --> 01:06:06,933
Frank Fox.

1101
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,100
- But that's the pouch that
 I gave to the gold transport.

1102
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,000
- We've got him.

1103
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,632
(townspeople laughing)

1104
01:06:23,632 --> 01:06:24,699
- Hey yo.

1105
01:06:24,699 --> 01:06:26,133
There's a whiskey bottle

1106
01:06:26,133 --> 01:06:27,200
on the deck.
 - No.

1107
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,766
- Even in the woods.
 - No!

1108
01:06:28,766 --> 01:06:30,000
- [Mark] Come on, honey.

1109
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,833
- Without holding
  on to anywhere.

1110
01:06:35,367 --> 01:06:37,166
Even on this deck.

1111
01:06:37,166 --> 01:06:42,066
What do you think, you land rat?

1112
01:06:42,066 --> 01:06:45,233
- Another drink for everybody!

1113
01:06:45,233 --> 01:06:48,500
(townspeople cheering)

1114
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:51,300
- Ahoy, later!

1115
01:06:52,567 --> 01:06:54,266
Push sail!

1116
01:06:54,266 --> 01:06:56,799
Now, full speed ahead!

1117
01:06:56,799 --> 01:07:00,300
We're heading into
  the heart of sea!

1118
01:07:01,166 --> 01:07:04,666
(townspeople vocalizing)

1119
01:07:16,933 --> 01:07:20,433
(townspeople celebrating)

1120
01:07:23,433 --> 01:07:25,666
(laughing)

1121
01:07:31,467 --> 01:07:32,467
- Quiet!

1122
01:07:32,467 --> 01:07:33,500
Quiet, everybody!

1123
01:07:34,733 --> 01:07:36,733
We know who attacked
 the gold transport.

1124
01:07:38,933 --> 01:07:41,300
I found this on a saddle back
 on horse stitched to a post

1125
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:43,133
not the 60 feet from here.

1126
01:07:43,133 --> 01:07:44,999
My two deputies will
 testify to that.

1127
01:07:46,166 --> 01:07:49,033
This bag of gold
  belong to Mr. Fox.

1128
01:07:49,033 --> 01:07:50,999
It was on the gold transport.

1129
01:07:50,999 --> 01:07:52,632
And the bag and the horse

1130
01:07:52,632 --> 01:07:54,632
belong to that man
 standing right there!

1131
01:07:55,632 --> 01:07:56,666
- [Man] Let me at him!

1132
01:07:56,666 --> 01:07:57,500
Who is this guy?

1133
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,933
(men clamoring)

1134
01:07:59,933 --> 01:08:01,533
- Get back, get back all of you!

1135
01:08:01,533 --> 01:08:03,166
I'm in charge here!

1136
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:04,433
I tell you it was that man.

1137
01:08:04,433 --> 01:08:06,300
They killed Cotton
 and stole the gold.

1138
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:07,632
- [Man] Let's string him up!

1139
01:08:10,133 --> 01:08:11,166
- Don't try anything.

1140
01:08:13,799 --> 01:08:16,133
If we string this fellow
up right here and now,

1141
01:08:17,567 --> 01:08:20,133
we might just as well say
 goodbye forever to our gold.

1142
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,266
(men clamoring)

1143
01:08:31,533 --> 01:08:32,467
- Captain, oh captain!

1144
01:08:34,333 --> 01:08:35,866
They've arrested Don Rutland.

1145
01:08:35,866 --> 01:08:36,699
- [Captain] Ahoy.

1146
01:08:36,699 --> 01:08:37,833
- Wake up!

1147
01:08:37,833 --> 01:08:40,500
(men clamoring)

1148
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:47,400
- Hey step back,
  watch it, come on.

1149
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:50,433
(men clamoring)

1150
01:08:50,433 --> 01:08:51,533
Come on, I'm the sheriff here.

1151
01:08:51,533 --> 01:08:52,367
Let me through.

1152
01:08:54,766 --> 01:08:55,866
Like I told you before,

1153
01:08:55,866 --> 01:08:57,533
the murderer better watch out.

1154
01:09:00,567 --> 01:09:01,833
(men clamoring)

1155
01:09:01,833 --> 01:09:02,766
- Quiet!

1156
01:09:02,766 --> 01:09:04,033
We captured the murderer!

1157
01:09:04,033 --> 01:09:06,066
Now, we have another
 reason to celebrate!

1158
01:09:06,066 --> 01:09:07,266
(men celebrating)

1159
01:09:07,266 --> 01:09:08,567
- [Man] That's what I say!

1160
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,433
(men celebrating)

1161
01:09:13,632 --> 01:09:16,632
(melancholic music)

1162
01:09:31,066 --> 01:09:32,699
- Well boy, Buck.

1163
01:09:33,666 --> 01:09:34,666
We can't do a thing.

1164
01:09:35,666 --> 01:09:36,500
Not a thing.

1165
01:09:40,333 --> 01:09:41,733
- [Rose] Whoa!

1166
01:09:41,733 --> 01:09:42,933
Hello, Harry.

1167
01:09:42,933 --> 01:09:44,266
- [Harry] What are
 you doing here, Rose?

1168
01:09:44,266 --> 01:09:46,699
- Have you seen a little
boy about 10 years old?

1169
01:09:46,699 --> 01:09:47,866
- [Harry] I haven't
 seen a fellow

1170
01:09:47,866 --> 01:09:49,400
long as I've been padding here.

1171
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:03,400
(suspenseful music)

1172
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:27,866
(spade clacks)

1173
01:10:47,266 --> 01:10:48,899
- Have you seen
 the kid today, Doc?

1174
01:10:53,367 --> 01:10:54,200
Robbie!

1175
01:11:01,433 --> 01:11:04,333
(fast-paced music)

1176
01:11:20,567 --> 01:11:21,400
Robbie!

1177
01:11:22,733 --> 01:11:24,066
That damn little brat.

1178
01:11:24,066 --> 01:11:25,266
Now, where's he gone to?

1179
01:11:33,966 --> 01:11:36,966
(suspenseful music)

1180
01:11:50,567 --> 01:11:53,133
(yells)

1181
01:11:53,133 --> 01:11:55,300
(yelling)

1182
01:12:14,632 --> 01:12:16,833
(yelling)

1183
01:12:25,766 --> 01:12:28,233
(gunshot bangs)

1184
01:12:28,233 --> 01:12:29,400
Little brat.

1185
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,333
What you think
 you're trying to do?

1186
01:12:30,333 --> 01:12:32,133
I'll teach you to take off.

1187
01:12:32,133 --> 01:12:33,467
- [Billy] Aw!

1188
01:12:33,467 --> 01:12:34,300
Aw!

1189
01:12:35,699 --> 01:12:37,966
- Go wash the blood off your
hands and get back to the tent.

1190
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:54,433
- Who are you?

1191
01:12:54,433 --> 01:12:56,533
Aren't you Billy Sanders?

1192
01:12:58,467 --> 01:13:01,467
(brooding music)

1193
01:13:01,467 --> 01:13:02,866
- No, I'm not.

1194
01:13:02,866 --> 01:13:04,367
I'm, no miss, I'm,

1195
01:13:06,367 --> 01:13:07,266
I'm Robbie!

1196
01:13:21,632 --> 01:13:24,567
(fast-paced music)

1197
01:13:28,866 --> 01:13:30,467
- Is Don Rutland home?

1198
01:13:30,467 --> 01:13:31,632
- Don Rutland?

1199
01:13:31,632 --> 01:13:33,666
Don Rutland's a
 thief and a murderer.

1200
01:13:33,666 --> 01:13:35,100
Well, he's the man who attacked

1201
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:37,066
and held up the gold transport
 and killed your father.

1202
01:13:37,066 --> 01:13:38,400
- No, that can't be true.

1203
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:39,333
- What's true enough?

1204
01:13:39,333 --> 01:13:40,133
You can ask him yourself.

1205
01:13:40,133 --> 01:13:41,300
He's over there in jail.

1206
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:54,333
- Don!

1207
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:58,833
Don, tell me the truth.

1208
01:13:58,833 --> 01:14:00,632
Tell me, well, did you?

1209
01:14:00,632 --> 01:14:01,433
- Get out!

1210
01:14:01,433 --> 01:14:02,266
What?

1211
01:14:02,266 --> 01:14:03,467
Get out of here!

1212
01:14:03,467 --> 01:14:04,367
- [Rose] Tell me
 it isn't the truth!

1213
01:14:04,367 --> 01:14:05,467
- [Buffins] Get out!

1214
01:14:05,467 --> 01:14:07,866
- Come on!
 - Who's gonna do it?

1215
01:14:13,666 --> 01:14:16,666
(melancholic music)

1216
01:14:21,666 --> 01:14:22,766
- Don't be sad, miss.

1217
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:26,300
Don is innocent, I know it.

1218
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,200
Everything will be
  clear enough soon.

1219
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:33,333
- Thanks, Ham.

1220
01:14:35,133 --> 01:14:37,699
(lively music)

1221
01:14:38,567 --> 01:14:42,066
(townspeople celebrating)

1222
01:14:54,433 --> 01:14:56,300
- I just wanna dance!

1223
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:57,433
- Leave me alone!

1224
01:14:57,433 --> 01:14:58,866
I don't feel like dancing!

1225
01:14:58,866 --> 01:14:59,799
- Why you?

1226
01:14:59,799 --> 01:15:01,266
You don't wanna dance with me?

1227
01:15:02,166 --> 01:15:04,333
- No, I don't!

1228
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:07,100
- He was your dream
 man, that Rutland.

1229
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:08,666
Now, it's quits with him.

1230
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,833
I like you, really.

1231
01:15:11,833 --> 01:15:13,933
I'm gonna buy you again.

1232
01:15:13,933 --> 01:15:15,066
I can buy everything.

1233
01:15:16,733 --> 01:15:17,567
- No!

1234
01:15:17,567 --> 01:15:18,400
No!

1235
01:15:20,266 --> 01:15:22,933
(men murmuring)

1236
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:25,233
- Just you wait.

1237
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:31,300
I'll get you.

1238
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:32,666
Music!

1239
01:15:32,666 --> 01:15:34,033
Come on, dance!

1240
01:15:36,266 --> 01:15:38,133
Dance, everybody!

1241
01:15:40,799 --> 01:15:43,400
(lively music)

1242
01:16:00,632 --> 01:16:02,367
- We'll do everything
 we can to see

1243
01:16:02,367 --> 01:16:05,300
that they give you a
 fair and square trial.

1244
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:07,666
Except first, you
 gonna have to tell us,

1245
01:16:07,666 --> 01:16:08,999
where you hid all the gold.

1246
01:16:10,166 --> 01:16:11,666
You should be ashamed
 to yourself though.

1247
01:16:11,666 --> 01:16:15,233
Stealing money from respectable
hardworking decent folks.

1248
01:16:15,233 --> 01:16:16,733
Another thing.

1249
01:16:16,733 --> 01:16:18,799
I don't plan to miss the
  celebration at the saloon

1250
01:16:18,799 --> 01:16:20,266
on account of you.

1251
01:16:20,266 --> 01:16:22,333
And you better not get any
 foolish notions about escaping

1252
01:16:22,333 --> 01:16:23,166
while I'm gone.

1253
01:16:24,533 --> 01:16:26,467
I'll give you another
 piece of advice.

1254
01:16:26,467 --> 01:16:27,799
Don't be sitting too
 hard on that chair

1255
01:16:27,799 --> 01:16:28,799
next to the wash down.

1256
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:30,033
The legs are very wobbly.

1257
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:23,300
(townspeople celebrating
from a distance)

1258
01:19:09,033 --> 01:19:11,133
(grunts)

1259
01:19:25,699 --> 01:19:30,266
(townspeople laughing
 and celebrating)

1260
01:20:07,233 --> 01:20:09,300
(grunts)

1261
01:20:10,899 --> 01:20:13,400
(punch thuds)

1262
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,133
- Like you said, I should
  get on Buffins's nerves.

1263
01:20:17,133 --> 01:20:19,066
- You sure did, thanks.

1264
01:20:24,433 --> 01:20:27,200
(window tapping)

1265
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:36,500
(gasps)

1266
01:21:02,233 --> 01:21:03,966
- [Rose] How did you?

1267
01:21:07,333 --> 01:21:08,166
- Close the curtain.

1268
01:21:17,666 --> 01:21:18,500
Rose, listen.

1269
01:21:20,533 --> 01:21:21,833
Do I have to explain?

1270
01:21:21,833 --> 01:21:23,166
- No, you don't have to.

1271
01:21:24,333 --> 01:21:25,166
I'm just happy.

1272
01:21:25,999 --> 01:21:26,833
- So am I.

1273
01:21:26,833 --> 01:21:28,166
- But you got to go.

1274
01:21:28,166 --> 01:21:28,999
- I know.

1275
01:21:33,899 --> 01:21:35,433
I got to find Billy.

1276
01:21:35,433 --> 01:21:38,333
- Yes, I saw a young boy but
 I couldn't get near to him.

1277
01:21:38,333 --> 01:21:40,633
There was a high ledge
on the river between us.

1278
01:21:40,633 --> 01:21:42,367
I heard a shot and
  then I saw him.

1279
01:21:42,367 --> 01:21:44,833
He was below me and he
has blood on his hands.

1280
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:45,733
- Did you talk to him?

1281
01:21:45,733 --> 01:21:46,933
- Yes.

1282
01:21:46,933 --> 01:21:48,200
I asked him if
 he's Billy Sanders.

1283
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:49,467
But he said his said
 he's name was Robbie.

1284
01:21:49,467 --> 01:21:51,433
But he said it in
  a strange manner

1285
01:21:51,433 --> 01:21:53,633
and as if he was under pressure.

1286
01:21:54,766 --> 01:21:56,899
- Rose, can you take me to him?

1287
01:21:56,899 --> 01:21:58,433
Do you remember the place?
  - Yes, yes!

1288
01:21:58,433 --> 01:21:59,266
- Good.

1289
01:22:00,567 --> 01:22:02,300
Rose, did your
 father have a rifle?

1290
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:03,200
I need a rifle.

1291
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:04,033
- Yes, had one.

1292
01:22:07,433 --> 01:22:09,333
But it's only got a few shells.

1293
01:22:09,333 --> 01:22:11,533
- That's alright, a few
is better than none.

1294
01:22:12,966 --> 01:22:15,066
Now get dressed, go on.

1295
01:22:15,066 --> 01:22:17,666
(door banging)

1296
01:22:19,933 --> 01:22:21,133
- What do you want here?

1297
01:22:22,333 --> 01:22:24,866
- Don't scream or I'll kill you.

1298
01:22:24,866 --> 01:22:26,567
(Betty screams)

1299
01:22:26,567 --> 01:22:27,866
You know what I
  like about woman?

1300
01:22:27,866 --> 01:22:28,966
You!

1301
01:22:28,966 --> 01:22:30,467
Right there!

1302
01:22:30,467 --> 01:22:31,633
You, it's you!

1303
01:22:32,533 --> 01:22:35,300
(Betty grunting)

1304
01:22:37,533 --> 01:22:38,367
- Betty!

1305
01:22:40,633 --> 01:22:42,899
(grunting)

1306
01:22:58,400 --> 01:22:59,833
(yells)

1307
01:22:59,833 --> 01:23:00,699
- No!

1308
01:23:01,633 --> 01:23:02,666
No!

1309
01:23:02,666 --> 01:23:04,300
No!

1310
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:06,367
(grunts)

1311
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:13,433
(Brandy groaning)

1312
01:23:53,467 --> 01:23:54,400
- Over there!

1313
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,166
That's where I saw the boy!

1314
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:58,766
- [Don] We better go on foot.

1315
01:23:58,766 --> 01:23:59,699
Buck, come on.

1316
01:24:10,433 --> 01:24:11,899
- There, see the blood spots?

1317
01:24:16,233 --> 01:24:17,567
They must be from that boy.

1318
01:24:20,633 --> 01:24:22,533
- Buck here, here.

1319
01:24:23,933 --> 01:24:24,766
Come on.

1320
01:24:24,766 --> 01:24:28,266
Do it.

1321
01:24:28,266 --> 01:24:29,533
Let's go.

1322
01:24:29,533 --> 01:24:32,100
(Buck barking)

1323
01:24:36,266 --> 01:24:38,266
(gasps)

1324
01:24:39,433 --> 01:24:40,266
- Captain.

1325
01:24:47,166 --> 01:24:48,500
- You're really,

1326
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,766
you're really a first
 class seaman, Betty.

1327
01:24:53,333 --> 01:24:55,333
I'll make you fist mate.

1328
01:24:58,999 --> 01:24:59,833
Ahoy.

1329
01:25:03,333 --> 01:25:05,600
(groaning)

1330
01:25:07,367 --> 01:25:10,600
(Betty sobbing)

1331
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:13,200
(somber music)

1332
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:19,833
- Murderer!

1333
01:25:19,833 --> 01:25:20,666
Murderer!

1334
01:25:21,933 --> 01:25:23,166
Murder!

1335
01:25:23,166 --> 01:25:25,033
Mark Monty has
 killed the captain!

1336
01:25:25,033 --> 01:25:25,966
He murdered him!

1337
01:25:25,966 --> 01:25:26,899
- The sheriff.
 - Come on!

1338
01:25:26,899 --> 01:25:27,699
- Come on, get the sheriff.

1339
01:25:27,699 --> 01:25:28,699
- Alright, follow us.

1340
01:25:28,699 --> 01:25:29,533
- [Frank] Come on, Doug.

1341
01:25:29,533 --> 01:25:30,666
Come on, let's go ahead.

1342
01:25:30,666 --> 01:25:31,866
- [Man] Here we go.

1343
01:25:31,866 --> 01:25:32,533
- [Tinker] We're gonna
 find the sheriff.

1344
01:25:32,533 --> 01:25:33,233
He's over here.

1345
01:25:33,233 --> 01:25:35,400
(men clamoring)

1346
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:36,233
- Sheriff.

1347
01:25:38,666 --> 01:25:40,833
Buffins, what's the matter?

1348
01:25:40,833 --> 01:25:41,666
Where's Rutland?

1349
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:49,766
Don't let him go away,
he let Rutland go free.

1350
01:25:49,766 --> 01:25:50,600
- [Man] Let's get him.

1351
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:51,799
- [Frank] Hey, get him!

1352
01:25:51,799 --> 01:25:53,100
Don't let him get away, come on!

1353
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:55,833
(horse neighing)

1354
01:25:58,899 --> 01:26:01,600
(punch thuds)

1355
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:02,567
- [Man] Our gold!

1356
01:26:02,567 --> 01:26:03,400
- [Frank] There it is!

1357
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:04,567
He had it all time!

1358
01:26:06,233 --> 01:26:08,733
- I think I've gotten
 on his nerves again.

1359
01:26:08,733 --> 01:26:10,999
(laughing)

1360
01:26:18,633 --> 01:26:19,966
- [Don] Hold it.

1361
01:26:22,733 --> 01:26:23,567
Come on.

1362
01:26:30,567 --> 01:26:32,100
- [Mark] Pack everything,
  we're getting outta here.

1363
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:33,333
Get the horses.

1364
01:26:33,333 --> 01:26:35,200
- You've finally
 come to your senses.

1365
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:37,200
We should've done
 this a long time ago.

1366
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:38,833
- [Mark] Shut up
  and start packing.

1367
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,600
- Hey, you're not
  leaving me here.

1368
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,600
Your gonna take me along
with you, aren't you?

1369
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:47,300
You just can't leave me here.

1370
01:26:48,433 --> 01:26:49,400
I wanna come along.

1371
01:26:51,699 --> 01:26:54,699
(suspenseful music)

1372
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:57,400
- They're leaving.

1373
01:26:58,833 --> 01:27:02,699
I have no idea what they're
 planning to do with Billy.

1374
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,567
Buck, Buck.

1375
01:27:05,567 --> 01:27:07,033
Billy's in there.

1376
01:27:07,033 --> 01:27:07,933
You gotta go get him.

1377
01:27:07,933 --> 01:27:08,899
Go get Billy.

1378
01:27:08,899 --> 01:27:10,200
Go on, go find him, go on.

1379
01:27:15,633 --> 01:27:17,066
- [Doc] Don't leave
 me here alone!

1380
01:27:17,066 --> 01:27:18,567
- Hurry up!
 - Take everything with you.

1381
01:27:18,567 --> 01:27:19,833
- We haven't got much time.
 - What did I do?

1382
01:27:19,833 --> 01:27:20,666
- [Mark] Lapporte.

1383
01:27:20,666 --> 01:27:22,066
- [Doc] Please, please.

1384
01:27:22,066 --> 01:27:24,166
- [Mark] We'll take
 Robbie's horse with us too.

1385
01:27:24,166 --> 01:27:26,300
We can put the ammunition
  and provision on him.

1386
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:27,533
Hurry up!

1387
01:27:27,533 --> 01:27:29,433
- [Doc] You can't
 just leave me here.

1388
01:27:29,433 --> 01:27:31,033
- [Lapporte] You can
 die with the kid.

1389
01:27:31,033 --> 01:27:32,233
- [Doc] Please.

1390
01:27:32,233 --> 01:27:33,266
- [Mark] Robbie's coming
along as a hostage.

1391
01:27:33,266 --> 01:27:34,533
- [Doc] Listen to me.

1392
01:27:34,533 --> 01:27:35,467
- [Lapporte] Which
  way we're headed?

1393
01:27:35,467 --> 01:27:36,200
- [Mark] South, to the border.

1394
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:37,899
California.

1395
01:27:37,899 --> 01:27:39,633
- Take me, Mark, please.

1396
01:27:39,633 --> 01:27:40,600
Take me, please.

1397
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:42,300
You can't leave me here.

1398
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:44,300
- [Mark] Doc, stop
  your blubbering.

1399
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:45,833
- [Lapporte] I'll
  stop him for you.

1400
01:27:47,133 --> 01:27:48,400
- [Mark] Let's go, come on.

1401
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:52,367
Come on, help me
 take down the tent.

1402
01:27:55,166 --> 01:27:57,533
- I've gotta stop them.

1403
01:27:57,533 --> 01:28:01,567
- [Doc] Please, you can't
  just leave me like this.

1404
01:28:01,567 --> 01:28:02,799
- [Mark] Doc.

1405
01:28:02,799 --> 01:28:05,600
- [Doc] Please, I
  don't wanna die.

1406
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:06,666
Please, Mark.

1407
01:28:08,633 --> 01:28:12,066
- [Mark] Robbie, Robbie!

1408
01:28:12,066 --> 01:28:12,899
- Billy!

1409
01:28:12,899 --> 01:28:15,567
(gunshots bang)

1410
01:28:24,633 --> 01:28:26,533
Rose, take Billy
  back to Camp Keno.

1411
01:28:26,533 --> 01:28:27,633
Get going, go on!

1412
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,100
- [Lapporte] Out of
 the way, you quack!

1413
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:32,933
- [Doc] No!

1414
01:28:36,166 --> 01:28:36,999
(gunshot bangs)

1415
01:28:36,999 --> 01:28:40,100
(Lapporte grunts)

1416
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:43,367
(brooding music)

1417
01:28:43,367 --> 01:28:44,400
(whistles)

1418
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:45,233
- Hey!

1419
01:28:46,333 --> 01:28:49,000
(gunshot bangs)

1420
01:28:50,266 --> 01:28:51,533
Hold it right there.

1421
01:28:51,533 --> 01:28:53,300
Or the next one, I'll
 put between your eyes.

1422
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:01,600
(suspenseful music)

1423
01:29:10,133 --> 01:29:10,966
Hold it, Mark.

1424
01:29:12,133 --> 01:29:14,133
I could kill you but I won't.

1425
01:29:14,133 --> 01:29:16,467
I'm gonna take you back
so you can face a trial.

1426
01:29:17,733 --> 01:29:20,400
(gunshots bang)

1427
01:29:24,367 --> 01:29:27,033
(gunshot bangs)

1428
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:33,266
(gunshot bangs)

1429
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:38,300
(suspenseful music)

1430
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:54,266
(gunshot bangs)

1431
01:30:07,166 --> 01:30:08,699
Mark, hey, hey!

1432
01:30:10,266 --> 01:30:11,567
Might as well give up!

1433
01:30:11,567 --> 01:30:13,300
I'm not gonna let you go!

1434
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:15,966
(gunshot bangs)

1435
01:30:20,966 --> 01:30:23,567
(gun clicking)

1436
01:30:29,467 --> 01:30:30,933
- [Mark] Hey!

1437
01:30:30,933 --> 01:30:33,666
Here, I'll throw my gun away.

1438
01:30:35,266 --> 01:30:36,467
Come on and get me.

1439
01:31:03,433 --> 01:31:04,266
(explosion bangs)

1440
01:31:04,266 --> 01:31:06,367
(grunts)

1441
01:31:13,166 --> 01:31:16,166
(suspenseful music)

1442
01:31:28,467 --> 01:31:30,133
- [Ham] Hold there.

1443
01:31:30,133 --> 01:31:32,300
- [Betty] Rose, what
 are you doing here?

1444
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:33,833
- I've just come from
 the Monkey Mines.

1445
01:31:33,833 --> 01:31:35,300
- Well, that's where
 we're headed for.

1446
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:36,999
- Man and his man were
 the ones who attacked

1447
01:31:36,999 --> 01:31:38,600
and robbed the gold transport.

1448
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:40,367
- Don Rutland is innocent.

1449
01:31:40,367 --> 01:31:41,633
- Buffins confessed.

1450
01:31:41,633 --> 01:31:43,266
Now, we're gonna get
 the real murderers.

1451
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,999
(suspenseful music)

1452
01:33:07,766 --> 01:33:10,500
(rocks thudding)

1453
01:33:16,033 --> 01:33:18,866
(explosion bangs)

1454
01:33:42,933 --> 01:33:45,533
(knife clanks)
 (grunts)

1455
01:33:45,533 --> 01:33:46,433
(suspenseful music)

1456
01:33:46,433 --> 01:33:50,999
(punch thuds)
 (grunts)

1457
01:34:09,766 --> 01:34:14,367
(punch thuds)
 (grunts)

1458
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:29,100
(punches thudding)
  (grunting)

1459
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:40,733
- Give up, Mark.

1460
01:34:40,733 --> 01:34:42,433
Give up, you haven't
 got a chance.

1461
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:45,433
- I give up.

1462
01:34:52,799 --> 01:34:54,100
- Put your hands together.

1463
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:57,467
Keep them there.

1464
01:34:57,467 --> 01:34:59,733
(grunting)

1465
01:35:05,033 --> 01:35:07,467
(Mark yells)

1466
01:35:09,233 --> 01:35:10,066
Hold on!

1467
01:35:11,933 --> 01:35:14,200
(groaning)

1468
01:35:17,567 --> 01:35:19,200
I'm coming!

1469
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:21,433
Hold on!

1470
01:35:21,433 --> 01:35:23,999
(Mark screams)

1471
01:35:27,433 --> 01:35:28,400
- [Ham] We've got the gold!

1472
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:29,733
- [Tinker] We've got the gold!

1473
01:35:29,733 --> 01:35:33,066
(townspeople clamoring)

1474
01:35:35,533 --> 01:35:36,999
- [Billy] He's
  trying to save me.

1475
01:35:36,999 --> 01:35:39,000
They shot at me and killed Buck.

1476
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,433
- [Don] Rose.

1477
01:35:40,433 --> 01:35:41,699
- Look, here's comes Don.

1478
01:35:42,533 --> 01:35:44,033
- Don!

1479
01:35:44,033 --> 01:35:44,833
- Billy?

1480
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:49,500
(mellow uplifting music)

1481
01:35:55,233 --> 01:35:57,666
The men that killed your
 father, Rose, are dead now.

1482
01:35:59,999 --> 01:36:01,100
- [Billy] Don!

1483
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:01,933
- [Don] Billy.

1484
01:36:03,733 --> 01:36:07,966
- Rutland, we all ask
 you to forgive us.

1485
01:36:07,966 --> 01:36:08,966
- I think it would be better

1486
01:36:08,966 --> 01:36:10,467
if you ask him if he wants to be

1487
01:36:10,467 --> 01:36:12,600
the new sheriff of Camp Keno.

1488
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,533
- [Man] Yeah, that's a
 good idea right there.

1489
01:36:14,533 --> 01:36:15,367
- No, no.

1490
01:36:17,999 --> 01:36:19,666
No.

1491
01:36:19,666 --> 01:36:23,699
I promised Billy's father
  that I'll be his friend

1492
01:36:23,699 --> 01:36:24,733
and take care of him.

1493
01:36:26,233 --> 01:36:30,966
So if you want to, let's go
 back to the mountains, huh.

1494
01:36:30,966 --> 01:36:31,899
- Yes, yes.

1495
01:36:34,799 --> 01:36:37,066
(Don yelling at huskies)

1496
01:36:37,066 --> 01:36:38,266
- [Don] Go Mariacha!

1497
01:36:38,266 --> 01:36:41,166
(Don laughing)

1498
01:36:41,166 --> 01:36:43,100
(Don yelling)

1499
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:46,433
(Don and Billy lauging)

1500
01:36:49,799 --> 01:36:51,133
Go, go Mariacha!

1501
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:55,699
(Don yelling)

1502
01:36:58,433 --> 01:37:01,866
(mellow uplifting music)
