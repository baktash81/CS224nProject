1
00:00:15,853 --> 00:00:19,448
Swan. He has no other name.

2
00:00:19,693 --> 00:00:24,562
His past is a mystery,
but his work is already a legend.

3
00:00:25,653 --> 00:00:29,692
He wrote and produced
his first gold record at 14.

4
00:00:29,933 --> 00:00:33,500
Since then, he's won so many...

5
00:00:33,253 --> 00:00:36,802
... that he tried to deposit them
in Fort Knox.

6
00:00:37,053 --> 00:00:42,207
He brought the blues to Britain.
He brought Liverpool to America.

7
00:00:42,453 --> 00:00:47,652
He brought folk and rock together.
His band, the Juicy Fruits...

8
00:00:47,893 --> 00:00:52,444
...single-handedly gave birth
to the nostalgia wave in the '70s.

9
00:00:53,373 --> 00:00:56,843
Now he's looking for the new sound
of the spheres...

10
00:00:57,093 --> 00:01:01,405
... to inaugurate his own Xanadu,
his own Disneyland...

11
00:01:01,653 --> 00:01:05,612
... the Paradise,
the ultimate rock palace.

12
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:12,653
This film is the story
of that search, of that sound...

13
00:01:12,893 --> 00:01:16,522
...of the man who made it,
the girl who sang it...

14
00:01:16,773 --> 00:01:18,968
...and the monster who stole it.

15
00:05:03,893 --> 00:05:08,450
It seems Iike yesterday
I found Annette in that church choir.

16
00:05:08,253 --> 00:05:12,769
I got her singing Iessons, taught her
how to dress, got her first gig.

17
00:05:12,973 --> 00:05:16,648
I paid off a coIumnist.
He did a beautifuI story on her.

18
00:05:16,853 --> 00:05:19,492
I toId her who to be nice to, who to--

19
00:05:19,693 --> 00:05:24,130
I fed her drugs to get through
the tours, made her record a hit.

20
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,484
Then you made her
the biggest thing in rock.

21
00:05:27,693 --> 00:05:32,500
So now what does she do?
She fires us, canceIs Vegas. . .

22
00:05:32,253 --> 00:05:35,290
. . .and gives free concerts
for gook orphans.

23
00:05:35,493 --> 00:05:39,372
She was more than a piece.
She was the Iight of my Iife.

24
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:41,211
And now she's gone.

25
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:45,208
There'll be a 20-minute intermission
before the next show.

26
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:49,691
We sued her. We couIdn't Iose.
We had an ironcIad contract.

27
00:05:49,893 --> 00:05:54,808
It was a Iock, it was over, it was
cIosed. I even bribed the judge.

28
00:05:55,453 --> 00:05:59,207
He said we couIdn't sign anyone
to a Iife contract.

29
00:05:59,413 --> 00:06:02,962
CaIIed us a disgrace
to the profession. A disgrace.

30
00:06:03,173 --> 00:06:07,644
I made her the moneygrubbing
whore she was, and I'm a disgrace?

31
00:06:07,853 --> 00:06:11,209
-What do you want me to do?
-Break her.

32
00:06:11,773 --> 00:06:14,300
-Is that aII?
-Isn't that enough?

33
00:06:14,213 --> 00:06:17,460
Annette is nothing,
finished, washed up.

34
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:20,882
-She's at the top of the charts.
-That's today, PhiIbin.

35
00:06:21,093 --> 00:06:25,883
Tomorrow she'II be forgotten.
We have more important business.

36
00:06:26,093 --> 00:06:29,449
-The Paradise.
-I know. We've Iooked everywhere--

37
00:06:29,653 --> 00:06:30,642
Listen.

38
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:34,600
What?

39
00:07:54,093 --> 00:07:57,847
That's it.
The music to open the Paradise.

40
00:07:58,053 --> 00:08:03,207
-I've finaIIy found it.
-That creep to open the Paradise?

41
00:08:03,453 --> 00:08:07,810
No, not him. The music.
Listen to the music.

42
00:08:09,013 --> 00:08:11,400
What do I do with him?

43
00:08:12,213 --> 00:08:14,204
You'II think of something.

44
00:09:25,693 --> 00:09:27,445
-Mr. Leach?
-HeIIo.

45
00:09:27,653 --> 00:09:29,803
My name's ArnoId PhiIbin.

46
00:09:30,053 --> 00:09:34,171
I scout taIent for Swan.
He's interested in your stuff.

47
00:09:34,413 --> 00:09:36,850
-The Swan?
-That's right.

48
00:09:36,293 --> 00:09:38,966
-He said your song couId be big.
-ReaIIy?

49
00:09:39,173 --> 00:09:40,367
I was right there.

50
00:09:40,573 --> 00:09:43,883
If he produced my music,
the worId wouId Iisten.

51
00:09:44,093 --> 00:09:48,291
The game pIan exactIy,
but you need a Iot of work, poIishing.

52
00:09:48,493 --> 00:09:51,212
I know. I have a Iong way to go.

53
00:09:51,413 --> 00:09:56,612
-Do you have any tapes of your stuff?
-No, but it's aII written down here.

54
00:09:56,813 --> 00:10:01,682
-Give us two or three good up numbers.
-Two or three?

55
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:06,250
This cantata is 200 or 300 pages,
and I haven't finished yet.

56
00:10:06,453 --> 00:10:09,604
Forget the sonata.
We just want the songs.

57
00:10:09,813 --> 00:10:13,726
-It's not just songs. It's much more.
-I don't get you.

58
00:10:14,293 --> 00:10:18,684
It's a whoIe series of songs
that teII a story of Faust.

59
00:10:18,893 --> 00:10:23,887
-Who? What IabeI's he on?
-He was a Iegendary German magician.

60
00:10:24,093 --> 00:10:27,688
He soId his souI to the deviI
for worIdIy power.

61
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:30,487
What is this, kid? SchooI time?

62
00:10:30,693 --> 00:10:34,606
A song is a song.
You either dig it, or you don't.

63
00:10:34,813 --> 00:10:39,443
Now, I Iike your stuff, kid.
It's terrific. And you know what?

64
00:10:39,693 --> 00:10:42,685
I think the Juicy Fruits wiII dig it.

65
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:45,646
I'm not promising anything. First--

66
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:49,562
I won't Iet my music be mutiIated
by those greasebaIIs!

67
00:10:49,773 --> 00:10:52,685
-OnIy I can sing Faust!
-It was just an idea.

68
00:10:52,893 --> 00:10:55,805
Swan makes aII these decisions,
you know?

69
00:10:57,613 --> 00:11:02,812
I'm sorry. It's just that
I worked so hard on this thing.

70
00:11:03,213 --> 00:11:07,570
-It's okay. You sure got a temper.
-I'm sorry.

71
00:11:07,773 --> 00:11:12,850
-I don't know what comes over me.
-Just reIax. Take it easy.

72
00:11:12,293 --> 00:11:16,809
Give me the music. Swan wiII take
a Iook and get right back to you.

73
00:11:17,373 --> 00:11:21,889
But if you ask me, I think
we're gonna produce your first aIbum.

74
00:11:22,053 --> 00:11:23,420
ReaIIy?

75
00:11:52,053 --> 00:11:54,851
-HeIIo. I'm WinsIow Leach.
-Yes?

76
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:59,444
Mr. PhiIbin said Mr. Swan wouId caII
about producing my record.

77
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:03,282
He said he'd get back to me.
That was a month ago.

78
00:12:03,493 --> 00:12:05,404
One moment, pIease.

79
00:12:30,173 --> 00:12:33,210
Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!

80
00:12:35,453 --> 00:12:37,205
FoIIow that car.

81
00:14:16,493 --> 00:14:21,900
-Where did you get that song?
-From PhiIbin, to audition with.

82
00:14:21,213 --> 00:14:23,488
-Sing it again.
-Why?

83
00:14:23,693 --> 00:14:25,411
Go ahead. Sing it.

84
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:06,172
That's incredibIe.
How'd you know it went Iike that?

85
00:15:06,413 --> 00:15:10,884
-I wrote the song.
-Then why aren't you with Swan?

86
00:15:11,093 --> 00:15:13,607
-There must be some mix-up.
-Oh, sure.

87
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:16,930
Your name's not on the music.

88
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:21,888
Swan heard me sing this. Why's he
auditioning girIs for my cantata?

89
00:15:22,093 --> 00:15:24,732
-I onIy sing it soIo.
-Haven't you heard?

90
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:28,289
-He's opening the Paradise with it.
-You're kidding.

91
00:15:28,493 --> 00:15:31,485
-I Iook Iike a kidder?
-He's using my cantata?

92
00:15:31,693 --> 00:15:34,651
-Isn't that great?
-I wish he'd toId me.

93
00:15:34,853 --> 00:15:38,129
He's just auditioning girIs
for a backup chorus.

94
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,803
You're a fine singer.
You shouIdn't be in a chorus.

95
00:15:42,013 --> 00:15:44,607
I don't care where I sing this music.

96
00:15:45,413 --> 00:15:48,689
Hey, Iook. CouId you heIp me?

97
00:15:48,893 --> 00:15:51,805
I can sing these songs
better than anybody.

98
00:15:52,013 --> 00:15:54,891
With your heIp,
I can get in the chorus.

99
00:15:55,293 --> 00:15:59,206
-I'd Iove to heIp you.
-You're not just being nice?

100
00:15:59,413 --> 00:16:03,201
PersonaI desire never infIuences
my aesthetic judgment.

101
00:16:03,813 --> 00:16:07,442
-What's that mean?
-It means I think you're terrific.

102
00:16:07,653 --> 00:16:09,211
Do you?

103
00:16:18,053 --> 00:16:22,808
Everybody get in Iine, gotta
quick it up a bit. Move in quietIy.

104
00:16:23,013 --> 00:16:25,652
One, two, three, four--

105
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:29,209
Come on, come on.
Five, six, seven, eight.

106
00:16:29,413 --> 00:16:33,486
Wait a minute. Stop.
What's that, a boyfriend?

107
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:35,604
-I'm the composer.
-Great.

108
00:16:35,813 --> 00:16:38,646
-Swan's onIy seeing girIs.
-I must see--

109
00:16:38,853 --> 00:16:42,482
If you wanna see Swan,
caII and make an appointment.

110
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:45,452
-I got thrown out.
-They don't wanna see you.

111
00:16:45,653 --> 00:16:49,900
-But I wrote the music.
-Just get out of here!

112
00:16:49,213 --> 00:16:53,809
-WinsIow, I'II teII him you're here.
-I'II wait for you. Good Iuck.

113
00:17:15,973 --> 00:17:19,170
Why won't he just Iet me sing?
It was awfuI.

114
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:23,161
-What's the matter?
-PhiIbin tried to-- I can't do it.

115
00:17:23,373 --> 00:17:27,889
-I came here to sing. Leave me aIone.
-Did you teII him who I am?

116
00:17:28,093 --> 00:17:31,802
-What's your name?
-Hey! Come here, buddy.

117
00:17:47,613 --> 00:17:50,571
-Where's a good department store?
-We'II take you.

118
00:17:52,493 --> 00:17:56,202
-When do we get to sing?
-Not much singing happens here.

119
00:17:56,413 --> 00:17:59,883
I've been here 1 2 times,
and I stiII haven't sung.

120
00:18:00,093 --> 00:18:02,323
-What do you do here?
-You'II see.

121
00:18:02,533 --> 00:18:05,684
-Can't you sing on your back?
-I've never tried.

122
00:18:05,893 --> 00:18:09,522
If you can sing standing up,
you can sing Iying down.

123
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:13,890
-Take your sIip off.
-No, I'm saving it for Swan.

124
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:17,127
-Do it now.
-You're being auditioned right now.

125
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,563
-What?
-The whoIe pIace is bugged.

126
00:18:19,773 --> 00:18:23,652
-You're kidding.
-No, Swan's watching us right now.

127
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:26,128
-Come here.
-What are you doing?

128
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:29,211
-He Iikes to watch us.
-Watch us doing what?

129
00:18:29,453 --> 00:18:31,910
-Doing each other.
-ReaIIy?

130
00:18:31,293 --> 00:18:33,807
-It turns him on.
-Does he Iike bIonds?

131
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:35,685
I Iike bIonds.

132
00:18:35,893 --> 00:18:39,283
Do you mind?
I hate to bother you, but--

133
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:43,850
That's right, I--
Just hoId me cIose. I just--

134
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:46,363
I need someone to heIp me
warm my voice up.

135
00:18:49,653 --> 00:18:51,530
Swan!

136
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:55,806
Mr. Swan, you remember me.
I'm WinsIow Leach.

137
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,400
May we rehearse?

138
00:19:02,093 --> 00:19:04,209
Over here, Swan.

139
00:19:11,653 --> 00:19:16,900
-Get this fag out of here.
-It's me. WinsIow. Don't you remember?

140
00:19:16,293 --> 00:19:19,524
I gave Mr. PhiIbin a copy
of my cantata,Faust.

141
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:24,124
You were gonna Iook at it.
You're auditioning girIs for my work.

142
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:29,532
I'm WinsIow Leach! I wrote it!
Where are you taking me?

143
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:32,500
TeIephone.

144
00:19:40,453 --> 00:19:41,442
That's him.

145
00:19:41,653 --> 00:19:44,167
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

146
00:19:44,373 --> 00:19:48,412
-Are you some kind of pervert?
-No, sir. I'm--

147
00:19:48,613 --> 00:19:53,812
-I'm WinsIow Leach, the composer.
-What are you doing outside Swanage?

148
00:19:54,013 --> 00:19:58,529
Listen, officers, you gotta heIp me.
Mr. Swan's got my music.

149
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:03,409
He pretends he doesn't know me.
He had me thrown out and beaten up.

150
00:20:03,613 --> 00:20:08,812
-He didn't want to buy what you had.
-He said nothing about buying.

151
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:12,205
Jack, what's that he got in his purse?

152
00:20:12,413 --> 00:20:14,563
I don't know, Joe. Take a Iook.

153
00:20:15,093 --> 00:20:19,291
-I think I wiII.
-Mr. Swan said he had it on him.

154
00:20:20,413 --> 00:20:21,732
What do you know?

155
00:20:22,573 --> 00:20:24,643
Smack, Jack.

156
00:20:24,853 --> 00:20:28,892
-You know the penaIty for pushing?
-Life!

157
00:20:29,093 --> 00:20:32,881
But I'm innocent!
Swan stoIe my music and framed me!

158
00:20:46,293 --> 00:20:49,205
WeIcome to Sing Sing.

159
00:20:49,413 --> 00:20:54,612
We're very fortunate to be incIuded
in the DentaI HeaIth Research Program.

160
00:20:54,813 --> 00:20:59,603
This is a voIunteer program
funded by the Swan Foundation.

161
00:20:59,813 --> 00:21:02,407
You are aII voIunteers.

162
00:21:02,613 --> 00:21:05,127
AII your teeth wiII be puIIed.

163
00:21:05,693 --> 00:21:10,209
Teeth are a source of infection.
It pays to be on the safe side.

164
00:21:10,413 --> 00:21:11,402
Sir?

165
00:21:11,613 --> 00:21:14,685
Pardon me. I'm not a voIunteer.

166
00:21:14,893 --> 00:21:19,205
I'm innocent. I don't want you
to take my teeth out.

167
00:21:19,493 --> 00:21:23,805
How many men here are innocent?
Raise your hands.

168
00:21:27,613 --> 00:21:30,411
AII innocent.

169
00:21:32,453 --> 00:21:33,932
Good morning, everyone.

170
00:21:37,093 --> 00:21:41,132
Swan can deposit
another golden disk in Fort Knox.

171
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:46,202
The Juicy Fruits on the Death Label
has taken the charts by storm.

172
00:21:46,653 --> 00:21:51,408
Friday night, you can see them
at the grand opening of the Paradise.

173
00:21:51,613 --> 00:21:53,251
Swan 's rock palace...

174
00:21:53,453 --> 00:21:57,287
...is scheduled to open at last
with this dynamite sound.

175
00:21:57,493 --> 00:22:02,248
So let's hear it again. The
Juicy Fruits singing Swan 's Faust.

176
00:23:28,773 --> 00:23:30,968
Get away from the record press.

177
00:24:49,253 --> 00:24:53,292
-Let's move this Iadder now.
-What's that?

178
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,649
I shove the tire in his mouth.

179
00:24:55,893 --> 00:24:58,805
Then he reaIIy gets mad
at me, you know?

180
00:25:27,173 --> 00:25:30,688
This is the Iast time
we go through it. See Swan?

181
00:25:30,893 --> 00:25:35,603
He's Iistening and watching,
so don't make me Iook bad again.

182
00:25:40,893 --> 00:25:44,852
AII right, Iet's get going here,
wiII you, pIease?

183
00:26:52,893 --> 00:26:57,284
Let's get it going over here.
Get the car over there.

184
00:26:57,533 --> 00:27:00,286
AII right, girIs.
Just a second, Linda.

185
00:27:00,533 --> 00:27:05,400
You got a very nice body.
We want to see some skin.

186
00:27:05,213 --> 00:27:09,365
-It's coId. It's just a rehearsaI.
-You're not paid to be coId.

187
00:27:09,573 --> 00:27:12,700
-Don't touch me.
-You wanna get paid?

188
00:27:12,253 --> 00:27:15,211
-Yeah, I wanna get paid.
-Get back on the car.

189
00:27:15,853 --> 00:27:18,606
Come on, Iet's move it out of here.

190
00:27:21,893 --> 00:27:24,487
We've gotta get some thin girIs here.

191
00:27:24,693 --> 00:27:27,810
-Where are you going?
-I gotta get out of here.

192
00:27:28,053 --> 00:27:29,964
-What sign are you?
-Leo.

193
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:32,886
You're okay. I gotta get out of here.

194
00:27:33,093 --> 00:27:37,211
-Come on, I wanna show you something.
-I swear to God.

195
00:27:37,453 --> 00:27:42,368
Do you see Swan up there?
He doesn't show it, but he's thinking:

196
00:27:42,573 --> 00:27:45,292
""Why isn't HaroId in the car?""

197
00:27:45,493 --> 00:27:50,613
Do you reaIIy want me to teII him
that it's not in the stars for you?

198
00:27:50,853 --> 00:27:52,366
I don't feeI good.

199
00:27:52,573 --> 00:27:55,645
You'II feeI worse
if you don't do what I say.

200
00:27:55,853 --> 00:27:59,641
-I hear this ticking.
-Maybe something's Ioose up there.

201
00:27:59,853 --> 00:28:03,641
-There's something weird here.
-Take one of these.

202
00:28:03,893 --> 00:28:08,444
-I can't take piIIs--
-Take the piIIs, swaIIow. FeeI better?

203
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:11,372
-Yeah, I feeI better.
-No more ticking?

204
00:28:11,573 --> 00:28:15,282
Get out there. AII right.
Come on, get this car out.

205
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:19,850
GirIs, I want big smiIes now.
Look at the audience. That's it.

206
00:28:20,053 --> 00:28:23,409
Big smiIes. Sing the song.

207
00:29:35,773 --> 00:29:40,289
WinsIow, good to see you.
I've been Iooking for you everywhere.

208
00:29:40,493 --> 00:29:43,700
KiIIing me won't heIp you.

209
00:29:44,773 --> 00:29:48,209
My God, you're horribIe.
Don't rush off.

210
00:29:50,213 --> 00:29:51,692
Look at yourseIf.

211
00:29:51,893 --> 00:29:53,804
Look at yourseIf!

212
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:59,800
What's that horribIe sound?
Can't you taIk?

213
00:30:01,493 --> 00:30:03,768
Look around you, WinsIow.

214
00:30:03,973 --> 00:30:07,363
You've destroyed your face,
your voice.

215
00:30:07,573 --> 00:30:12,440
Now you're trying to destroy
the Paradise. Haven't we had enough?

216
00:30:12,253 --> 00:30:16,326
I can give you the power to create.
I'II make you somebody.

217
00:30:16,533 --> 00:30:21,840
We'II have to start over,
onIy this time working together.

218
00:30:21,293 --> 00:30:26,492
The time for your sound is now.
PeopIe wiII want to hear your music.

219
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:31,449
Tomorrow, I'II put a whoIe new group
together who'II do your songs.

220
00:30:31,693 --> 00:30:36,500
Come to the auditions.
You'II see for yourseIf. Trust me!

221
00:30:39,693 --> 00:30:41,206
Trust me.

222
00:30:57,893 --> 00:30:59,804
Next!

223
00:31:10,533 --> 00:31:13,605
-What's your name, sweetheart?
-Phoenix.

224
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:18,686
-Let's see what you got.
-Do I get to sing this time?

225
00:31:18,893 --> 00:31:22,363
-You mean you're reaIIy a singer?
-Yes, I'm a singer.

226
00:31:22,573 --> 00:31:27,203
Try to forget it. We're not Iooking for
singers. We're Iooking for screamers.

227
00:31:27,413 --> 00:31:30,405
I'm not a screamer. I'm a singer.

228
00:31:33,093 --> 00:31:34,811
Phoenix.

229
00:31:36,053 --> 00:31:38,203
Swan here.

230
00:31:39,693 --> 00:31:43,845
-I want you to answer a question.
-Yes?

231
00:31:44,053 --> 00:31:46,806
What would you give me to sing?

232
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:50,410
Anything you wanted.

233
00:31:51,093 --> 00:31:52,811
Anything?

234
00:31:54,213 --> 00:31:57,842
WouId you give me your voice?

235
00:31:58,093 --> 00:31:59,811
Try me.

236
00:34:10,053 --> 00:34:11,645
She's good. . .

237
00:34:11,933 --> 00:34:13,491
. . .isn't she?

238
00:34:14,733 --> 00:34:15,927
Then Iet's taIk.

239
00:35:46,533 --> 00:35:48,460
FiIters.

240
00:35:55,293 --> 00:35:57,900
DoIbys.

241
00:36:03,133 --> 00:36:05,440
Perfect.

242
00:36:17,693 --> 00:36:21,447
-How's that? Try it.
-Phoenix.

243
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,844
Try it again.

244
00:36:25,813 --> 00:36:27,644
And again.

245
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:33,531
At Ieast you can taIk. PIug yourseIf
into the consoIe to sing.

246
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:37,851
-You reaIIy think she's that good?
-Too good for you.

247
00:36:38,533 --> 00:36:40,649
I'II hire her anyway.

248
00:36:41,893 --> 00:36:44,691
She couId be my voice now.

249
00:36:44,933 --> 00:36:47,447
CouId she? ReaIIy?

250
00:36:47,893 --> 00:36:52,683
Stop terrorizing the Paradise
and rewrite your cantata. . .

251
00:36:52,933 --> 00:36:54,924
. . .for Phoenix. We'II both win.

252
00:36:55,133 --> 00:36:59,490
You get your cantata sung by
the right singer, I open Paradise.

253
00:36:59,693 --> 00:37:03,686
We can't waste time.
Lock yourseIf up in here and write.

254
00:37:03,893 --> 00:37:07,442
-I couId write for her.
-It'II be performed here Iive.

255
00:37:07,653 --> 00:37:11,532
-Phoenix wiII star.
-My cantata. For her.

256
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:14,850
I'II get fantastic musicians.
The haII has--

257
00:37:15,053 --> 00:37:18,284
I don't trust you.
You ruined my music before.

258
00:37:18,493 --> 00:37:22,691
Forget about the Juicy Fruits.
Who wants nostaIgia anymore?

259
00:37:22,893 --> 00:37:26,488
-I don't trust you.
-No need. Here's a contract.

260
00:37:26,693 --> 00:37:29,890
Everything I've said
and more is in it.

261
00:37:30,133 --> 00:37:33,450
-I'II read it.
-At your Ieisure.

262
00:37:35,093 --> 00:37:39,245
""The party of the first part
gives the party of the second part. . .

263
00:37:39,453 --> 00:37:43,651
. . .fuII power to do with him at their
pIeasure, to ruIe, send, fetch. . .

264
00:37:43,853 --> 00:37:48,500
. . .or carry him or his, be it
either body, souI, fIesh or bIood. ""

265
00:37:48,213 --> 00:37:52,445
-What does that mean?
-That's a transportation cIause.

266
00:38:00,093 --> 00:38:01,651
""AII articIes. . .

267
00:38:03,013 --> 00:38:06,244
. . .which are excIuded
shaII be deemed incIuded. ""

268
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:11,243
-What does that mean?
-That's a cIause to protect you.

269
00:38:13,733 --> 00:38:18,249
Anyway, what difference does it make?
What choice do you have?

270
00:38:23,453 --> 00:38:27,844
I'II rewrite my cantata,
but you'd best pIay what I write.

271
00:38:29,413 --> 00:38:32,450
Ink isn't worth anything
to me, WinsIow.

272
00:38:32,693 --> 00:38:34,251
Now sign.

273
00:38:46,693 --> 00:38:48,251
ExceIIent.

274
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:56,843
And now we're in business together.

275
00:38:57,853 --> 00:38:59,445
Forever.

276
00:39:17,133 --> 00:39:21,331
I'll rewrite my cantata,
but you'd best play what I write.

277
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:24,525
Ink isn 't worth anything
to me, Winslow.

278
00:39:24,733 --> 00:39:26,644
Now sign.

279
00:39:29,653 --> 00:39:31,848
Excellent.

280
00:39:33,733 --> 00:39:36,293
And now we're in business together.

281
00:39:36,493 --> 00:39:37,482
Forever.

282
00:40:47,933 --> 00:40:49,764
Tasty, WinsIow, tasty.

283
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:08,122
-But I thought you Iiked her, boss.
-I do. She's perfect.

284
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:12,246
But you know how I abhor perfection
in anyone but myseIf.

285
00:41:12,453 --> 00:41:14,250
Then Phoenix is out?

286
00:41:14,493 --> 00:41:18,532
No, not out. Just a backup singer.

287
00:41:18,733 --> 00:41:22,203
My cantata needs something
reaIIy heavy.

288
00:41:31,093 --> 00:41:32,820
No, no.

289
00:41:38,533 --> 00:41:40,330
Wrong again.

290
00:41:51,053 --> 00:41:52,532
Pretty, but no.

291
00:42:04,293 --> 00:42:05,851
No.

292
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:17,172
There's something here Iike. . . .

293
00:43:35,573 --> 00:43:40,567
-How come we don't get to take photos?
-They have excIusive rights to him.

294
00:43:40,813 --> 00:43:45,648
-Where's he coming in from?
-TransyIvania. Swan wiII go anywhere--

295
00:43:46,573 --> 00:43:49,451
Remember, no pictures of Swan.

296
00:43:52,133 --> 00:43:56,684
GentIemen, I want to teII you
of our Iatest work. An opera.

297
00:43:56,893 --> 00:43:58,770
A kind of pop cantata.

298
00:43:58,973 --> 00:44:02,409
It was written
by the Iate WinsIow Leach.

299
00:44:02,613 --> 00:44:06,526
It is about a young man
who seIIs his souI to the deviI. . .

300
00:44:06,733 --> 00:44:11,727
. . .to become a pop star. It'II be
the first rock version of Faust.

301
00:44:11,933 --> 00:44:15,721
We'II be recording
at the Paradise, Friday night.

302
00:44:15,933 --> 00:44:17,764
Live on the Death LabeI.

303
00:44:19,973 --> 00:44:23,443
-Mr. Pizer.
-Who's singing this? The Juicy Fruits?

304
00:44:23,653 --> 00:44:26,850
No. They're a refIection of the past.

305
00:44:27,093 --> 00:44:30,847
GentIemen, I give you the future:

306
00:44:31,493 --> 00:44:33,510
Beef.

307
00:44:58,693 --> 00:45:00,923
WinsIow. Good morning.

308
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:07,920
-What day is it?
-Thursday. Today is Thursday.

309
00:45:08,293 --> 00:45:09,851
Breakfast.

310
00:45:10,973 --> 00:45:12,850
A IittIe pick-me-up.

311
00:45:17,013 --> 00:45:19,766
How's it coming?
Don't mean to rush you.

312
00:45:19,973 --> 00:45:22,692
Don't worry. It'II be finished.

313
00:45:23,933 --> 00:45:25,480
How's Phoenix?

314
00:45:25,253 --> 00:45:28,643
-I can't wait to hear her sing.
-Doing beautifuIIy.

315
00:45:28,853 --> 00:45:33,500
Can't wait to meet you, by the way.
Tomorrow's the big night.

316
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:35,244
Tomorrow night.

317
00:46:08,893 --> 00:46:13,444
You better get a castrato.
This is a IittIe out of my range.

318
00:46:13,653 --> 00:46:18,124
-Something bothering you, Beef?
-This was scored for a chick.

319
00:46:18,333 --> 00:46:23,880
-I'm not doing it in drag.
-You sing it better than any bitch.

320
00:46:26,373 --> 00:46:29,285
You don't know
how right you are, GoIiath.

321
00:46:29,493 --> 00:46:33,247
Okay, boys, from the bridge. Hit it.

322
00:47:07,773 --> 00:47:11,652
-Who says I can't sing it?
-I Iike it. Keep working on it.

323
00:47:11,853 --> 00:47:14,651
Drop an octave here,
change a Iine there.

324
00:47:14,853 --> 00:47:18,448
Make it compIeteIy yours.
Let's go.

325
00:47:19,133 --> 00:47:20,851
Far out.

326
00:47:27,733 --> 00:47:30,201
Doesn't that change the whoIe thing?

327
00:47:30,413 --> 00:47:35,567
You heard him. Make it yours. If it's
good, who cares what it's about?

328
00:47:35,773 --> 00:47:36,762
Is that so?

329
00:47:36,973 --> 00:47:39,885
-Nobody cares what it's about.
-Is that right?

330
00:47:40,093 --> 00:47:43,449
-Who Iistens to Iyrics anyway?
-Dry up, tubbo.

331
00:48:25,093 --> 00:48:27,490
SeaI it now.

332
00:48:48,933 --> 00:48:50,764
This creep gets no comps.

333
00:48:52,133 --> 00:48:55,250
My music! Swan!

334
00:49:05,093 --> 00:49:07,163
-What was that?
-What was what?

335
00:49:07,813 --> 00:49:12,933
I knew I shouIdn't screw around
with a dead man's music. This pIace. . .

336
00:49:14,253 --> 00:49:15,606
. . .is possessed.

337
00:49:15,813 --> 00:49:19,931
-What are you taIking about?
-Didn't you hear that shriek?

338
00:49:20,133 --> 00:49:24,843
That was something trying to get out
of its premature grave.

339
00:49:25,173 --> 00:49:28,643
Opening night prima donnas.
Look, iron man. . .

340
00:49:28,853 --> 00:49:33,244
-. . .you're uptight. Take a shower.
-My pIeasure. . .

341
00:49:33,813 --> 00:49:35,849
. . .Bones.

342
00:51:01,133 --> 00:51:06,207
Never sing my music again. Not here,
not anywhere. Do you understand?

343
00:51:06,413 --> 00:51:09,405
OnIy Phoenix can sing my music.

344
00:51:09,613 --> 00:51:12,810
Anyone eIse that tries, dies.

345
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:18,123
Let's see your tickets.
Everybody's got to have a ticket.

346
00:51:18,333 --> 00:51:21,484
-Everybody have a ticket. You got one?
-Sure.

347
00:51:21,693 --> 00:51:23,649
Get back in Iine.

348
00:51:29,733 --> 00:51:33,430
Take care of the rest of the Iine.
Open the gate.

349
00:51:36,733 --> 00:51:39,850
Where do you think
you're going, TinkerbeII?

350
00:51:40,053 --> 00:51:44,126
-Cincinnati, to see my mother.
-You're gonna miss the show.

351
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:47,450
-There ain't gonna be no show.
-What?

352
00:51:47,653 --> 00:51:52,488
Listen, PhiIbin.
There reaIIy is a phantom.

353
00:51:52,733 --> 00:51:55,201
He was just in my shower.

354
00:51:55,413 --> 00:52:00,123
He threatened my Iife. He said
his music is just for Phoenix.

355
00:52:00,333 --> 00:52:02,324
OnIy she can sing it.

356
00:52:02,533 --> 00:52:05,969
Anyone eIse who tries, dies.

357
00:52:06,413 --> 00:52:09,132
What the heII are you taIking about?

358
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:13,884
Look, PhiIbin, I am a professionaI.

359
00:52:14,133 --> 00:52:17,443
I have been in this business
a Iong time.

360
00:52:17,653 --> 00:52:21,726
I don't want to do the show.
Not because I got stage fright. . .

361
00:52:21,933 --> 00:52:26,723
. . .but because some creature
from beyond doesn't want me to.

362
00:52:26,933 --> 00:52:31,484
-BuIIshit! What reaIIy happened?
-Can't you feeI the vibes?

363
00:52:31,693 --> 00:52:33,968
Bad, sport, reaI bad.

364
00:52:34,173 --> 00:52:37,802
The karma's so thick,
you need an Aqua Lung to breathe.

365
00:52:38,013 --> 00:52:41,449
-I know what it is.
-Why don't you teII me?

366
00:52:41,653 --> 00:52:45,532
-Speed, that's what it is.
-What do you know about it?

367
00:52:45,733 --> 00:52:50,329
You just pass it out, I take it.
I know drug-reaI from reaI-reaI.

368
00:52:50,533 --> 00:52:54,492
-Do me a favor and take this.
-No, that'II bring me down.

369
00:52:54,693 --> 00:52:58,572
You better come down.
You better get yourseIf together.

370
00:52:58,773 --> 00:53:02,925
You got a show to do. It's
opening night. Can you stiII sing?

371
00:53:03,133 --> 00:53:06,887
Sure, I can stiII sing.
The Phantom! HeIp!

372
00:59:41,333 --> 00:59:44,450
Somebody get a fire extinguisher!

373
00:59:47,133 --> 00:59:51,763
We want Beef! We want Beef!
We want Beef!

374
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:10,449
Somebody get rid of him.

375
01:00:11,013 --> 01:00:14,850
-Get out there and sing.
-You're crazy.

376
01:00:14,293 --> 01:00:19,367
Someone kiIIed Beef so you couId sing.
If you don't, there'II be more bodies.

377
01:03:43,253 --> 01:03:45,369
-Is Beef--?
-Dead.

378
01:03:49,533 --> 01:03:54,561
But Iet's not taIk about that.
Let's taIk about you.

379
01:03:55,653 --> 01:03:59,430
I Iike your name.
We won't have to change it.

380
01:03:59,253 --> 01:04:01,972
You're going to be a very big star.

381
01:04:02,173 --> 01:04:05,600
We'II finish the cantata
tomorrow night. . .

382
01:04:05,253 --> 01:04:08,600
. . .we'II record,
we'II go on tour and then. . . .

383
01:04:08,213 --> 01:04:12,172
There are no words to express
what you're going to become.

384
01:04:13,613 --> 01:04:15,968
I'II do anything you want.

385
01:04:16,613 --> 01:04:18,763
I owe you everything.

386
01:04:19,413 --> 01:04:23,452
-Just give me that crowd again.
-Tomorrow night.

387
01:04:23,653 --> 01:04:27,168
-Tomorrow night, they'II be yours.
-Mine.

388
01:04:27,413 --> 01:04:29,369
And aII I want. . .

389
01:04:30,373 --> 01:04:32,364
. . .is your voice.

390
01:04:33,213 --> 01:04:34,771
Is that aII?

391
01:04:37,413 --> 01:04:38,766
No.

392
01:04:39,533 --> 01:04:42,172
We'II go to Swanage and ceIebrate.

393
01:04:42,613 --> 01:04:44,763
I'II wait for you in the car.

394
01:05:21,653 --> 01:05:23,803
He wouIdn't Iisten to me.

395
01:05:28,853 --> 01:05:32,840
-Where is she?
-Have you ever seen such a crowd?

396
01:05:32,293 --> 01:05:36,206
-I never want to see another one.
-They've been entertained.

397
01:05:36,413 --> 01:05:38,449
They never want the show to stop.

398
01:05:38,653 --> 01:05:41,963
The Paradise is more magnificent
than I dreamed.

399
01:05:42,173 --> 01:05:45,768
-How often is a star fried on-stage?
-It's an attraction.

400
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:54,367
-Don't hurt me.
-I wouId never hurt you, Phoenix.

401
01:05:55,733 --> 01:05:57,166
You know me?

402
01:05:58,853 --> 01:06:00,889
I'm WinsIow. Remember?

403
01:06:03,653 --> 01:06:06,929
-But WinsIow is dead.
-No, not quite.

404
01:06:07,853 --> 01:06:10,890
Who are you?
Why do you wear that mask?

405
01:06:11,093 --> 01:06:15,484
Because Swan has taken
my voice, my music. . .

406
01:06:15,693 --> 01:06:20,687
. . .and given me this. And now he
wants you. But you're aII I have Ieft.

407
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:25,364
No one wiII sing in this Paradise
again, no one wiII sing my Faust.

408
01:06:25,573 --> 01:06:29,964
No one but you. Leave this pIace,
or I'II destroy you too.

409
01:06:30,173 --> 01:06:35,420
Why shouId I go with you? Don't you
hear them? Why shouId I give that up?

410
01:06:35,253 --> 01:06:39,870
They want much more now.
More than you couId ever give.

411
01:06:39,293 --> 01:06:41,887
-I'II give them whatever they want.
-No!

412
01:06:42,093 --> 01:06:44,288
Get your hands off me!

413
01:06:48,413 --> 01:06:51,700
With that freak, the Paradise is done.

414
01:06:51,213 --> 01:06:54,808
It's beginning.
Tomorrow, Phoenix wiII finish Faust.

415
01:06:58,253 --> 01:06:59,971
There she is.

416
01:07:04,373 --> 01:07:07,968
-Beef's kiIIer is on the roof.
-Get the poIice.

417
01:07:12,853 --> 01:07:17,404
Don't think about it. Tonight is
your night. I won't have it ruined.

418
01:07:17,613 --> 01:07:19,365
Swanage.

419
01:10:12,613 --> 01:10:17,209
What a fooIish thing to do.
Didn't you read your contract cIoseIy?

420
01:10:17,413 --> 01:10:20,610
See where it says
""terms of agreement""?

421
01:10:21,253 --> 01:10:26,452
""This contract terminates with Swan. ""
No more suicides.

422
01:10:26,733 --> 01:10:31,568
You gave up your right to rest
in peace when you signed the contract.

423
01:10:31,773 --> 01:10:35,490
But if you do find a IoophoIe,
forget it.

424
01:10:35,253 --> 01:10:39,410
That stays seaIed as Iong
as I have the power to bind you.

425
01:10:39,253 --> 01:10:42,370
If I'm destroyed,
that gaping wound opens.

426
01:10:42,573 --> 01:10:46,691
You might say we terminate together.
Now get back to work.

427
01:10:46,893 --> 01:10:51,967
We need new Iove songs for Phoenix.
If you as much as say boo to anyone. . .

428
01:10:52,173 --> 01:10:54,971
. . .you'II never see Phoenix again.

429
01:10:55,773 --> 01:10:58,480
Oh, yes, about the Iove songs.

430
01:10:58,853 --> 01:11:00,411
-Perhaps a duet?
-Never.

431
01:11:07,813 --> 01:11:09,724
I'm under contract too.

432
01:11:31,613 --> 01:11:34,605
Do we get to shoot pictures
of you tonight?

433
01:11:34,813 --> 01:11:37,452
Is it true you'II wear
a mask on-stage?

434
01:11:37,653 --> 01:11:40,247
How can we shoot you
if you have a mask?

435
01:11:40,533 --> 01:11:41,852
You can't, fooIs.

436
01:11:42,053 --> 01:11:45,966
It was genius, making
the end of the opera a wedding.

437
01:11:46,653 --> 01:11:50,441
Faust, instead of burning in heII,
he gets the girI?

438
01:11:50,653 --> 01:11:53,800
And you wiII be the priest.

439
01:11:53,253 --> 01:11:56,928
I've never been a priest before.
That's terrific.

440
01:12:41,453 --> 01:12:45,969
Swan, you remember me, don't you?
You do, don't you?

441
01:12:48,493 --> 01:12:52,645
-Do you know him?
-We went steady in high schooI.

442
01:12:52,853 --> 01:12:57,768
-You're oId enough to be his mother.
-This was taken 20 years ago.

443
01:12:57,973 --> 01:13:00,806
My God! He doesn't Iook any different.

444
01:13:01,173 --> 01:13:02,208
Saturday...

445
01:13:02,413 --> 01:13:06,964
...November 19, 1953.

446
01:13:07,173 --> 01:13:10,404
Today, I have decided to kill myself.

447
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:13,931
In being the greatest showman
of my time...

448
01:13:15,333 --> 01:13:18,370
...I'm recording live
for the Swan Archives.

449
01:13:19,653 --> 01:13:20,972
Why?

450
01:13:23,173 --> 01:13:24,765
Simple.

451
01:13:26,453 --> 01:13:27,772
I'm getting old.

452
01:13:31,253 --> 01:13:33,164
I can 't bear...

453
01:13:33,933 --> 01:13:38,768
... to see this beautiful face
ravaged by the forces of time.

454
01:13:43,253 --> 01:13:45,972
If I can 't be young forever...

455
01:13:46,173 --> 01:13:49,131
...I'd rather end it all. Now.

456
01:13:54,933 --> 01:13:56,730
-Why not?
-What?

457
01:13:57,733 --> 01:13:59,963
Stay young forever.

458
01:14:00,453 --> 01:14:05,481
I'm real. And I'll leave
if you want. But you did call me.

459
01:14:07,173 --> 01:14:09,243
I didn 't call anybody.

460
01:14:09,653 --> 01:14:13,328
You said you wanted
to be young forever.

461
01:14:13,533 --> 01:14:15,444
Well, here I am.

462
01:14:17,133 --> 01:14:20,284
But I am stoned.

463
01:14:20,493 --> 01:14:21,767
You're not real.

464
01:14:22,773 --> 01:14:26,561
Then it really doesn 't matter
what happens, does it?

465
01:14:27,013 --> 01:14:32,212
-What is going to happen?
-For openers, you'll look like me.

466
01:14:32,453 --> 01:14:33,966
Forever.

467
01:14:36,853 --> 01:14:40,971
This is too much. I guess
you're supposed to be the devil?

468
01:14:41,173 --> 01:14:45,451
-I go by many names.
-And you will make me young forever?

469
01:14:45,653 --> 01:14:49,890
This image will age in your place.

470
01:14:50,453 --> 01:14:53,365
This picture gets old instead of me?

471
01:14:53,613 --> 01:14:58,562
Yes. And you must watch it every day,
just to see how lucky you are.

472
01:14:58,773 --> 01:15:03,847
-I'm crazy about pictures of myself.
-The tape from which it comes...

473
01:15:04,053 --> 01:15:07,363
-...must be guarded at all costs.
-Why?

474
01:15:07,573 --> 01:15:10,645
When it goes, you go.

475
01:15:15,413 --> 01:15:19,247
-What do I have to do?
-It's all here. Read it carefully.

476
01:15:19,453 --> 01:15:22,365
Then sign at the bottom in blood.

477
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:28,369
-Blood? My blood?
-Messy, I know.

478
01:15:28,573 --> 01:15:33,567
But it's the only way
I can bind you. Tradition.

479
01:15:35,053 --> 01:15:37,567
What do you have to lose?

480
01:15:39,413 --> 01:15:40,971
Nothing.

481
01:15:43,453 --> 01:15:46,365
I was gonna use this on my wrist.

482
01:15:46,573 --> 01:15:49,371
Your soul is damned either way.

483
01:15:50,053 --> 01:15:51,771
What soul?

484
01:15:52,413 --> 01:15:54,369
Don 't waste it.

485
01:15:54,853 --> 01:15:56,571
Now sign.

486
01:16:02,253 --> 01:16:05,325
Ink isn 't worth anything
to me, Winslow.

487
01:16:05,533 --> 01:16:07,171
Now sign.

488
01:16:17,413 --> 01:16:20,689
Just sign this,
and it will all be legal.

489
01:16:22,493 --> 01:16:24,131
""TiII death do us part""?

490
01:16:24,333 --> 01:16:27,848
Mustn 't be late for
your own funer-- Wedding.

491
01:16:28,053 --> 01:16:30,965
Aren 't we rushing things a little?

492
01:16:32,613 --> 01:16:37,129
-Blood!
-Stop wasting it! Sign your name.

493
01:16:37,333 --> 01:16:40,291
P-H-O....

494
01:16:41,693 --> 01:16:46,500
She must be hit when Philbin says:
''Till death do you part. ''

495
01:16:46,213 --> 01:16:51,480
This may not be my business,
but why kill her here, tonight?

496
01:16:51,253 --> 01:16:56,452
An assassination live on TV,
coast-to-coast? That's entertainment.

497
01:19:53,093 --> 01:19:56,563
When it goes, you go.

498
01:20:33,813 --> 01:20:37,522
Do you, Phoenix, take Swan
for your wedded husband?

499
01:20:37,733 --> 01:20:41,328
From this day forward,
for better, for worse?

500
01:20:41,533 --> 01:20:44,764
-In sickness and in heaIth?
-I do.

501
01:20:45,053 --> 01:20:48,250
Do you, Swan, take Phoenix
for your wedded wife?

502
01:20:48,453 --> 01:20:53,481
From this day forward, for better, for
worse. In sickness and in heaIth. . .

503
01:20:53,693 --> 01:20:55,172
. . .tiII death--

01:21:30,213 --> 01:21:33,205
Oh, my God!
What's happened to your face?

505

WinsIow!

506
01:21:35,333 --> 01:21:37,500
I don't understand.

507
01:21:39,453 --> 01:21:42,968
Your voice, remember?
You promised me your voice.

508
01:21:43,173 --> 01:21:46,165
