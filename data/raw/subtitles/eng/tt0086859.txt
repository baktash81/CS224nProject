1
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,256
Senor?

2
00:01:54,506 --> 00:01:58,635
- Have you seen this woman?
- No, Senor.

3
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,303
Gracias.

4
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:01,041
Senor? Senor?

5
00:04:03,751 --> 00:04:05,420
Gracias.

6
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:16,096
10, 42, 36, hut, hut, hut!

7
00:04:23,436 --> 00:04:25,188
Way to go, Brogan!

8
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:27,941
The old man can still catch, huh?

9
00:04:30,318 --> 00:04:32,528
Take care of that shoulder.
Good job.

10
00:04:32,737 --> 00:04:34,739
Nice legs, but watch
this one.

11
00:04:34,989 --> 00:04:36,490
Brogan!

12
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,457
I didn't like what I saw on Sunday.

13
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,252
What? I caught
the winning touchdown.

14
00:04:49,502 --> 00:04:52,005
You missed that track-back block.

15
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,590
You were worried about your shoulder.

16
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:56,759
Doctor says
there's no permanent damage.

17
00:04:57,593 --> 00:05:01,138
I don't want any weaknesses
read by the other team.

18
00:05:01,555 --> 00:05:03,807
You took yourself off
the injured reserve.

19
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:05,517
You said you were healthy.

20
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:07,602
The shoulder is solid.

21
00:05:07,853 --> 00:05:09,354
Why don't you prove that?

22
00:05:09,604 --> 00:05:10,605
I intend to.

23
00:05:10,855 --> 00:05:12,065
I mean right now.

24
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:14,859
Mrs. Wyler's paying you...

25
00:05:15,109 --> 00:05:17,320
...to play football, not
talk about it.

26
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,864
Why don't you go over to the sled?

27
00:05:20,573 --> 00:05:21,991
The sled is bullshit.

28
00:05:22,241 --> 00:05:25,202
I got two rookies who
need playing time, Brogan.

29
00:05:25,452 --> 00:05:28,205
Either go to the sled or
sit on the bench.

30
00:05:30,165 --> 00:05:33,835
No, Stassen. I'll go over
there and prove it to you.

31
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:36,087
Sam! Go with him.

32
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:38,423
Come on, Sam.

33
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:40,967
No matter how long you play,
they want you...

34
00:05:41,217 --> 00:05:42,510
...to prove it one more time.

35
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,803
North field scrimmage.

36
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:46,722
That guy's been on my ass
since he got here.

37
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,148
Here we go.
All right, hand down.

38
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,899
Look at me. Ready.

39
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,818
Hit it!

40
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,990
Sam, get on it.

41
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,622
All right, hand down.
Look at me.

42
00:06:13,872 --> 00:06:15,249
Hit it!

43
00:06:17,084 --> 00:06:17,918
Fuck!

44
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:23,214
Sully! I'd like you to meet our
County Supervisor, Ed Phillips.

45
00:06:23,465 --> 00:06:25,467
He's Mrs. Wyler's guest today.

46
00:06:26,843 --> 00:06:27,969
I'm a big fan.

47
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:31,889
Not only of the Outlaws, but of
the football you played.

48
00:06:32,807 --> 00:06:35,142
Football's changed since
I was a player.

49
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:36,685
Right, right.

50
00:06:37,436 --> 00:06:39,396
I guess that run of injuries...

51
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:41,440
...kind of hurt you guys.

52
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,608
We had a lousy bench last year.

53
00:06:43,859 --> 00:06:46,695
We had to play a lot
of injured ball players.

54
00:06:46,945 --> 00:06:48,738
That's part of the job.

55
00:06:48,988 --> 00:06:50,740
You never played injured?

56
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,450
Yeah, well, I was dumb.

57
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,286
I don't like my boys
getting hurt permanently.

58
00:06:56,078 --> 00:06:57,705
That's why they
call him " Mother. "

59
00:06:57,955 --> 00:06:59,331
Hit it!

60
00:06:59,957 --> 00:07:02,042
I don't know about being a supervisor.

61
00:07:02,292 --> 00:07:04,962
I sure as hell don't know
about being a lawyer.

62
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:09,841
But if I was a lawyer I wouldn't know
shit about football, would I?

63
00:07:10,091 --> 00:07:11,426
Excuse me.

64
00:07:13,303 --> 00:07:15,054
Let's get out of here.

65
00:07:15,305 --> 00:07:16,639
Hit it!

66
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:21,060
You don't have to do this, Brogan.

67
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,728
The fucker's not beating me.

68
00:07:25,773 --> 00:07:27,191
Hand down again. Look at me!

69
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:28,525
Hit it!

70
00:07:30,777 --> 00:07:33,947
I'm the trainer here, and I say
he's had enough.

71
00:07:35,615 --> 00:07:37,825
What're you trying to prove?
You're a veteran!

72
00:07:38,076 --> 00:07:41,037
What a dumb fucking thing
to have me do!

73
00:07:41,913 --> 00:07:44,165
Wait for me in my office, Brogan.

74
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,641
Steve Kirsch's office.

75
00:08:03,891 --> 00:08:07,103
This is Terry Brogan.
I need to speak to Steve.

76
00:08:09,438 --> 00:08:13,025
The Outlaws just put me on waivers.

77
00:08:13,275 --> 00:08:14,860
I'm sorry to hear that.

78
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,321
I'm a big fan of yours, Terry.

79
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:20,365
Hold, please. It's Terry Brogan.
He's been cut.

80
00:08:20,615 --> 00:08:22,992
- Call Schumacher.
- He needs to talk to you.

81
00:08:23,243 --> 00:08:24,619
I don't handle players.

82
00:08:25,537 --> 00:08:26,496
Get rid of him.

83
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:35,462
Hello. Mr. Kirsch can't talk, but
he suggests you call Hal Schumacher.

84
00:08:35,713 --> 00:08:38,841
I don't want
Hal Schumacher I want Steve.

85
00:08:39,091 --> 00:08:40,217
When's he available?

86
00:08:40,676 --> 00:08:42,260
I really don't know.

87
00:08:44,095 --> 00:08:46,473
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

88
00:08:54,522 --> 00:08:56,774
- They screw up my shoulder, then cut me.
- Shit!

89
00:08:56,982 --> 00:08:58,734
That's it in a word.

90
00:08:58,984 --> 00:09:00,736
They promised they'd keep you.

91
00:09:00,986 --> 00:09:02,696
This is behind my back, kid.

92
00:09:02,946 --> 00:09:04,448
Yeah, I figured.

93
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,784
At first I thought
they'd pay me off.

94
00:09:07,993 --> 00:09:09,494
But I want to play football.

95
00:09:09,744 --> 00:09:11,871
Not this year.
Not with that shoulder.

96
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:13,665
Let me ask you something.

97
00:09:13,915 --> 00:09:16,250
What makes you think
they'll pay you off?

98
00:09:17,335 --> 00:09:18,419
I was injured.

99
00:09:18,711 --> 00:09:22,506
You played two games great. If you're
injured, you didn't look it.

100
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,299
What was I supposed to do?

101
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,344
If I give them any trouble,
they cut me.

102
00:09:27,594 --> 00:09:29,096
They cut you anyway.

103
00:09:29,346 --> 00:09:32,474
They're rebuilding.
More profit, less talent.

104
00:09:32,724 --> 00:09:34,059
You cost too much.

105
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:36,769
They're not screwing me around.

106
00:09:37,061 --> 00:09:38,688
I'm gonna see my lawyer.

107
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:42,942
I'll miss the pressure.

108
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,575
Give me a call.

109
00:09:58,748 --> 00:10:01,292
Caxton, Benjamin, Parker and Stein.

110
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:03,503
Yes, he is.
Hold on a moment.

111
00:10:03,753 --> 00:10:04,587
May I help you?

112
00:10:04,795 --> 00:10:08,883
- I'm here to see Steve Kirsch.
- I'll ring his office.

113
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:10,551
Hello.

114
00:10:12,302 --> 00:10:13,929
I'm here to see Steve Kirsch.

115
00:10:14,137 --> 00:10:17,557
I know. I'm the one you've been
talking to all day.

116
00:10:17,808 --> 00:10:19,309
The one who's a big fan?

117
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:20,769
What's your name?

118
00:10:20,977 --> 00:10:21,853
Edie.

119
00:10:22,103 --> 00:10:24,522
Edie, he's not ever
going to talk to me?

120
00:10:24,731 --> 00:10:27,233
You're down in my book to call.

121
00:10:27,942 --> 00:10:30,361
- Where's his office?
- He's not here.

122
00:10:31,445 --> 00:10:33,906
I know you gotta keep your job, Edie.

123
00:10:34,114 --> 00:10:35,449
You have a nice face. I-

124
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:37,451
I'm telling you the truth.

125
00:10:38,327 --> 00:10:41,621
It wouldn't be out of line for
you to lie, would it?

126
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,418
Where is he?

127
00:10:54,425 --> 00:10:56,927
Terry! It's good to see you.

128
00:10:57,178 --> 00:10:58,512
I'm cut from the Outlaws.

129
00:10:59,221 --> 00:11:02,474
I know, I heard. The firm
represents Mrs. Wyler.

130
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:08,605
Since I joined the firm,
I can't represent players.

131
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,858
Mrs. Wyler owns the Outlaws.
She's our biggest client.

132
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,860
It's a conflict of interest.

133
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,738
Wait a minute. When you came
hustling me in school...

134
00:11:17,989 --> 00:11:20,616
...I put my career in your hands.
Remember?

135
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,702
You're right.
I'm sorry. Sit down.

136
00:11:27,748 --> 00:11:29,416
I've been playing injured.

137
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,419
They know, but they don't
want to pay me off.

138
00:11:33,003 --> 00:11:35,713
I think that's what their
position's gonna be.

139
00:11:35,964 --> 00:11:37,298
Their position's fucked.

140
00:11:37,507 --> 00:11:39,509
I'll go to the Players' Association.

141
00:11:40,092 --> 00:11:42,094
You could do that, but listen.

142
00:11:42,303 --> 00:11:46,265
What happens if the Outlaws prove
that you're perfectly fine?

143
00:11:46,765 --> 00:11:49,768
They've got film when you're
in practice, games.

144
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,772
They're gonna fight for
a long, long time.

145
00:11:54,689 --> 00:11:58,568
Steve, look.

146
00:11:59,444 --> 00:12:01,738
I'm having money problems, man.

147
00:12:01,946 --> 00:12:02,780
I'm broke.

148
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:07,493
Did you spend every cent
you ever made?

149
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:14,833
Let me think for
just a second here.

150
00:12:18,587 --> 00:12:21,506
I should get you a low-interest loan
to tide you over.

151
00:12:22,632 --> 00:12:24,509
- Excuse me-
- Could you wait, please?

152
00:12:27,178 --> 00:12:30,556
I'll talk to these guys,
see if I can soften their position...

153
00:12:30,806 --> 00:12:33,601
...and get you something so
it's not a hassle.

154
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:37,271
Excuse me, Mr. Kirsch.
The reception?

155
00:12:37,563 --> 00:12:38,605
Mr. Caxton's waiting.

156
00:12:38,855 --> 00:12:41,108
Right, I forgot. I gotta go.

157
00:12:41,358 --> 00:12:43,193
I gotta know about this soon.

158
00:12:44,319 --> 00:12:46,029
I'll get on it first thing.

159
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:48,781
You're one of my first players, huh?

160
00:12:56,914 --> 00:12:59,374
Mike Hogan and his wife, Susan.
Ben Cassidy.

161
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:00,834
Thank you for coming.

162
00:13:08,883 --> 00:13:10,552
Here's Hal Schumacher's number.

163
00:13:10,802 --> 00:13:13,346
Call him. He's a nice man.

164
00:13:13,596 --> 00:13:16,349
Do they always get bombed
at the end of the day?

165
00:13:16,849 --> 00:13:20,102
It's business down there.
It's an intimate fundraiser.

166
00:13:20,311 --> 00:13:21,145
What do you mean?

167
00:13:21,395 --> 00:13:23,564
Mr. Caxton has assessed every lawyer...

168
00:13:23,814 --> 00:13:28,235
...$1500 to contribute to the
reelection of Councilman Weinberg.

169
00:13:28,693 --> 00:13:32,197
Mrs. Wyler is Caxton's
biggest client, isn't she?

170
00:13:32,405 --> 00:13:35,366
Yes. In fact, he's doing business
for her right now.

171
00:13:35,617 --> 00:13:37,035
Yeah? For the Outlaws?

172
00:13:37,285 --> 00:13:40,538
No. Mrs. Wyler's real business
is real estate.

173
00:13:40,746 --> 00:13:43,916
Caxton wants a zoning variance
on Wyler's canyon...

174
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,126
...so she can build houses there.

175
00:13:46,377 --> 00:13:49,213
His guest of honour tonight
could vote against it.

176
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:51,673
Trust me, he won't now.

177
00:13:57,095 --> 00:14:01,182
I hate things like before.
When I couldn't be straight with you.

178
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,228
I'm running out of conversation.

179
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,897
I'm sorry.

180
00:14:08,105 --> 00:14:08,939
I gotta go.

181
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,316
I'd like to have a drink with you.

182
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:12,985
The Ginger Man, after work?

183
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:15,237
Okay, sure. The Ginger Man.

184
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,091
Touchdown.

185
00:14:39,926 --> 00:14:44,472
What are you doing here? You been cut.
They can get you for trespassing.

186
00:14:44,722 --> 00:14:46,432
I'd outrun them.

187
00:14:47,725 --> 00:14:49,060
Why are you here, Tommy?

188
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,895
Jake wants to see you.

189
00:14:52,563 --> 00:14:53,397
How is Jake?

190
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:55,900
He got stabbed last week.

191
00:14:56,191 --> 00:14:57,609
What a shame.

192
00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:00,779
He survived, Brogan.

193
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:05,742
Why does he want me?

194
00:15:06,284 --> 00:15:08,536
He might have a job for you.

195
00:15:09,579 --> 00:15:11,539
You tell him " No thanks. "

196
00:15:11,789 --> 00:15:13,458
He'll be at the beach tomorrow.

197
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:16,043
There's a volleyball game.

198
00:15:16,293 --> 00:15:17,586
Yeah? Is he playing?

199
00:15:19,046 --> 00:15:21,006
I told you, he got stabbed, man.

200
00:15:22,758 --> 00:15:24,176
Well, he lived, right?

201
00:15:26,636 --> 00:15:29,014
You got problems now, Terry.

202
00:15:29,264 --> 00:15:30,557
You want trouble too?

203
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:38,606
Come to the beach tomorrow.

204
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,441
You're not dumb.

205
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:42,318
Besides...

206
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:45,029
...what the hell else you got to do?

207
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,877
Sam!

208
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,005
Sam!

209
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,549
Come here!

210
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,469
You look good as a cripple.

211
00:16:11,511 --> 00:16:14,890
Is that why I had to come here,
to give you my opinion?

212
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,558
How are you doing?

213
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:18,226
Lousy.

214
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:19,894
How's your life?

215
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,772
Club? The Palace
is doing great.

216
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,901
The other business is even better.
My action's half a million a week.

217
00:16:27,151 --> 00:16:31,614
You know the grand prize for
the guys who win? Thirty grand.

218
00:16:31,822 --> 00:16:34,283
It's not bad, is it?
A few hours on the beach.

219
00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:37,786
Don't tell me you're taking
action on this game?

220
00:16:38,662 --> 00:16:40,413
You think these are beach rats?

221
00:16:42,832 --> 00:16:44,626
These are world-class players.

222
00:16:44,876 --> 00:16:46,461
You didn't know that?

223
00:16:47,503 --> 00:16:49,672
Sam, come here!

224
00:16:50,673 --> 00:16:53,759
People love to bet on sports.
I just help them out.

225
00:16:55,135 --> 00:16:58,138
South Bay guys love this game,
and they got money.

226
00:16:58,388 --> 00:16:59,514
I'll take their action.

227
00:16:59,765 --> 00:17:02,601
Who's the fuzzy face?
Do you wanna cookie?

228
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:04,060
There's one!

229
00:17:04,769 --> 00:17:06,563
You fuzzy face, come on!

230
00:17:06,855 --> 00:17:09,399
What kind of dog is gonna
hang out with you?

231
00:17:09,649 --> 00:17:11,275
He doesn't belong to me.

232
00:17:11,526 --> 00:17:13,444
He belongs to the lady who cut me.

233
00:17:14,153 --> 00:17:16,572
You're into violent women now?

234
00:17:16,781 --> 00:17:18,866
Look, I was a bit of an asshole.

235
00:17:19,366 --> 00:17:22,828
I got crazy and popped her.
She came after me with a knife.

236
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:24,496
Just missed my balls.

237
00:17:24,705 --> 00:17:26,623
And was she going for them?

238
00:17:26,873 --> 00:17:28,250
Don't they all?

239
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:33,046
You got a new Porsche, huh?

240
00:17:33,338 --> 00:17:35,548
What the fuck,
you're rich, right?

241
00:17:35,923 --> 00:17:39,051
Let's talk it over at
the Palace. What do you say?

242
00:17:40,302 --> 00:17:41,887
We'll go like the old days.

243
00:17:42,096 --> 00:17:43,472
You up to it?

244
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,933
Come on, Sam. Come on!

245
00:17:46,183 --> 00:17:47,643
Come on, get in the car.

246
00:17:47,893 --> 00:17:49,728
I'll just meet you there.

247
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:52,230
You get afraid of me
in your old age?

248
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:53,440
Yeah, right.

249
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:54,691
Come on.

250
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:58,403
Be a good release. Need to
release a little tension?

251
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,489
Do I have to tie one leg
behind my back?

252
00:18:01,739 --> 00:18:03,074
Take the old route.

253
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,366
Sunset.

254
00:18:19,214 --> 00:18:21,132
Let's see if you still got balls!

255
00:18:46,489 --> 00:18:49,158
- How'd you like that?
- Damn good!

256
00:19:06,966 --> 00:19:07,800
Where were you?

257
00:19:15,391 --> 00:19:16,225
That was smart.

258
00:19:17,601 --> 00:19:18,602
See you!

259
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,336
You're still number two!

260
00:19:46,587 --> 00:19:48,296
Dream on, Terry!

261
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:53,593
Son of a bitch!

262
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:06,689
What a fucking idiot!

263
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,273
Scared the shit out of you?

264
00:20:09,858 --> 00:20:13,028
I'm an asshole for racing with you!
I'm pulling out!

265
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:15,613
Come on, don't pussy out on me now!

266
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,494
The fun's over!

267
00:20:23,788 --> 00:20:24,914
Not yet!

268
00:21:01,406 --> 00:21:03,908
Sam, be quiet! Get over here.

269
00:21:05,118 --> 00:21:06,995
What kept you?
I was getting worried.

270
00:21:07,203 --> 00:21:10,540
I was afraid you got stuck
in all that garbage.

271
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,250
Can't have a fair race with
a goddamn maniac.

272
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:15,544
Here, maybe this will fix you up.

273
00:21:17,087 --> 00:21:18,881
Have a taste of this.

274
00:21:22,301 --> 00:21:23,718
How about a Guinness?

275
00:21:23,969 --> 00:21:25,679
Wanna tell me what
I'm doing here?

276
00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:27,764
You're out of a job, right?

277
00:21:28,014 --> 00:21:30,350
I've got some job
possibilities for you.

278
00:21:30,642 --> 00:21:33,186
For one, you can work right back here.

279
00:21:33,436 --> 00:21:34,770
Celebrity bartender.

280
00:21:35,021 --> 00:21:38,482
Making drinks and telling
football stories to drunks.

281
00:21:38,691 --> 00:21:39,942
How does that sound?

282
00:21:40,192 --> 00:21:43,195
You take the job. You're
a lot funnier than I am.

283
00:21:43,445 --> 00:21:45,155
How about security guard?

284
00:21:45,364 --> 00:21:47,282
I mean, you know how to get hit.

285
00:21:47,532 --> 00:21:50,785
The point is, for a guy
in your situation, Terry...

286
00:21:50,994 --> 00:21:53,079
...the options stink.

287
00:21:55,957 --> 00:21:57,625
Or you can find her for me.

288
00:21:59,543 --> 00:22:01,212
Who's this, the knife lady?

289
00:22:01,712 --> 00:22:03,923
She's very important to me, Terry.

290
00:22:04,381 --> 00:22:05,841
I think of her all the time.

291
00:22:06,633 --> 00:22:08,302
That's a new reality for you.

292
00:22:08,552 --> 00:22:12,055
She stole 50 grand from me.
I would've given her the money.

293
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:13,515
I want her back.

294
00:22:13,723 --> 00:22:15,141
And I want you to find her.

295
00:22:16,226 --> 00:22:19,354
You're crazy. Why would you
trust me with her?

296
00:22:20,229 --> 00:22:21,522
Jessie hates ball players.

297
00:22:22,732 --> 00:22:24,358
Do you think that's funny?

298
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:29,154
She's also Mrs. Wyler's daughter.
Did you ever meet her?

299
00:22:30,906 --> 00:22:33,825
I've heard about her. She's
supposed to be wild.

300
00:22:34,034 --> 00:22:36,870
Her father was an English guy
Mrs. Wyler married.

301
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,832
One of those stage actors who
can't make it in American films.

302
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,377
Anyway, after he died,
Mr. Wyler adopted her.

303
00:22:45,086 --> 00:22:47,463
An owner's daughter, living
with a bookie.

304
00:22:47,713 --> 00:22:49,298
That's something, isn't it?

305
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:53,344
She hates her mother.
Treated her like a possession.

306
00:22:56,054 --> 00:22:59,599
You know how it is to be one
of Mrs. Wyler's possessions?

307
00:23:03,395 --> 00:23:05,563
I'll give you $10,000 right now.

308
00:23:05,813 --> 00:23:07,565
Pay your expenses.

309
00:23:07,815 --> 00:23:11,694
And if you find her,
I'll give you $20,000 more.

310
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,949
You're crazy.
I'm a football player.

311
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:18,784
Without a team.

312
00:23:19,284 --> 00:23:22,329
That new Porsche of yours,
is it paid for?

313
00:23:24,414 --> 00:23:27,208
What are you gonna do, man?
Sell insurance?

314
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:31,254
You don't have the personality
to work for the networks.

315
00:23:32,964 --> 00:23:35,174
I don't want you to bring
her back, man.

316
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,968
Just find her. Tell me where she is.

317
00:23:38,219 --> 00:23:41,513
What does that take? Time and money.

318
00:23:41,722 --> 00:23:44,850
You got the time right now.
I got the money.

319
00:23:45,642 --> 00:23:46,560
Great.

320
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,396
You know, I've never used
what I got on you.

321
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,148
Could be otherwise.

322
00:23:54,108 --> 00:23:56,944
I wouldn't want that. Would you?

323
00:23:58,446 --> 00:23:59,447
It's simple.

324
00:23:59,655 --> 00:24:02,408
Either you want to play
football again or you don't.

325
00:24:02,658 --> 00:24:04,451
You never change, do you?

326
00:24:05,994 --> 00:24:07,120
Not a bit.

327
00:24:07,663 --> 00:24:10,916
Try Mrs. Wyler. She probably
knows where Jessie is.

328
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:12,417
Right.

329
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,299
If this is about you being cut...

330
00:24:20,508 --> 00:24:23,928
...I don't involve myself with
day-to-day team business.

331
00:24:24,178 --> 00:24:26,555
That's not why I came here,
Mrs. Wyler.

332
00:24:28,223 --> 00:24:32,394
Then suppose you tell me exactly
what you want with me, Mr. Brogan.

333
00:24:33,562 --> 00:24:34,938
I'm looking for your daughter.

334
00:24:36,731 --> 00:24:40,068
We're very close, and she
disappeared all of a sudden.

335
00:24:42,195 --> 00:24:43,029
Give me a break.

336
00:24:43,488 --> 00:24:44,906
What do you mean?

337
00:24:45,364 --> 00:24:46,782
He sent you.

338
00:24:48,534 --> 00:24:49,368
Who?

339
00:24:50,536 --> 00:24:51,954
Jake...

340
00:24:52,162 --> 00:24:53,372
...Wise.

341
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:56,166
She was only with him to spite me.

342
00:24:57,667 --> 00:25:00,128
I don't know what she did
to get away from him.

343
00:25:00,378 --> 00:25:03,465
What matters is, she got
the hell away from him.

344
00:25:03,756 --> 00:25:05,049
Why not drink to that?

345
00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:07,385
Grace?

346
00:25:11,889 --> 00:25:15,726
Ed seems to have solved
the Soames problem.

347
00:25:15,976 --> 00:25:18,395
The head of the planning commission
is coming Saturday.

348
00:25:18,979 --> 00:25:21,773
We're finally softening up these
environmentalists.

349
00:25:21,982 --> 00:25:23,400
How wonderful.

350
00:25:24,317 --> 00:25:26,945
You seem to have won
the opposition over.

351
00:25:27,195 --> 00:25:29,614
A good project sells itself.

352
00:25:30,448 --> 00:25:32,366
MOBSO's got other mountains to save.

353
00:25:34,118 --> 00:25:35,327
You know Terry Brogan.

354
00:25:35,828 --> 00:25:36,662
How are you?

355
00:25:38,706 --> 00:25:41,375
- And Supervisor Phillips.
- I'm a big fan.

356
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,085
Thanks.

357
00:25:43,377 --> 00:25:47,380
I wonder if you'd mind going ahead.
We'll be right along.

358
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:49,466
Yes, of course.

359
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:52,051
- Be with you in a minute.
- See you then.

360
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:58,182
It seems Mr. Brogan has a new job.

361
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,810
Working for Jake Wise.

362
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,729
Looking for Jessica.

363
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:07,733
You and Wise good friends?

364
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,778
I go to his club for the music.
So do a lot of the team.

365
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,658
Why don't you let us steal
you from him?

366
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,327
I won't let Jessica live like this.

367
00:26:19,535 --> 00:26:21,662
I'll double whatever he's paying you.

368
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:24,165
I'm not some gun for hire.

369
00:26:24,415 --> 00:26:26,959
He can't top what we offer,
can he, Ben?

370
00:26:29,211 --> 00:26:31,880
He can't give you your job back
with the Outlaws.

371
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,596
We could consider something.

372
00:26:40,805 --> 00:26:44,016
You know, it isn't easy for
Jessica to hide from me.

373
00:26:44,267 --> 00:26:46,477
She's been drawing from her trust.

374
00:26:46,727 --> 00:26:50,981
It's going to a little bank in Mexico.
To an island.

375
00:26:51,231 --> 00:26:53,150
Cozumel.

376
00:26:54,026 --> 00:26:56,737
You could keep a watch on her.

377
00:26:56,987 --> 00:27:00,031
Make sure he gets nowhere
near her again.

378
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,410
You know...

379
00:27:06,579 --> 00:27:09,332
...I used Jake Wise
as an excuse to come here.

380
00:27:09,582 --> 00:27:11,417
I did come to get my job back.

381
00:27:13,252 --> 00:27:16,588
I didn't deserve what I got.
I played some good ball.

382
00:27:17,422 --> 00:27:19,216
I got a lot of good years left.

383
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:23,637
I want to be back on the team,
but because I'm worth it.

384
00:27:23,887 --> 00:27:27,932
Not because I spied on some
25-year-old who ran away from home.

385
00:27:28,891 --> 00:27:31,727
I'm not going to spy for you
or Jake Wise.

386
00:27:31,978 --> 00:27:34,855
Ben, this young man
is trespassing here.

387
00:27:35,356 --> 00:27:36,732
Throw him out.

388
00:27:43,905 --> 00:27:46,116
I don't believe you're wanted here.

389
00:27:46,825 --> 00:27:50,203
And you can forget about Kirsch.
He's on my team.

390
00:27:50,453 --> 00:27:54,874
You want the Outlaws to
pay you off? Sue us.

391
00:27:55,082 --> 00:27:56,584
Walk him to his car.

392
00:27:56,834 --> 00:27:59,253
I can kick myself out, thanks.

393
00:28:24,068 --> 00:28:26,153
Ten years' work, Grace.

394
00:28:26,362 --> 00:28:28,655
And we're this close.

395
00:28:31,658 --> 00:28:35,328
I think just a few members of the team
would have been enough.

396
00:28:35,578 --> 00:28:39,123
Having the Outlaws out here, full force,
is kind of crowding it.

397
00:28:39,374 --> 00:28:43,044
I have to get some use out of them.
I don't like football.

398
00:28:45,588 --> 00:28:46,672
Ben!

399
00:28:49,174 --> 00:28:50,217
We got troubles.

400
00:28:51,677 --> 00:28:53,095
Soames is here.

401
00:28:53,345 --> 00:28:56,389
He's brought a lot of those
Save The Mountain people.

402
00:28:56,598 --> 00:28:58,558
It doesn't look good.

403
00:28:58,975 --> 00:29:01,102
Goddamn environmentalist bastards.

404
00:29:02,312 --> 00:29:05,857
I think you'd better handle this.
Come on, Ed.

405
00:29:06,065 --> 00:29:08,734
I can't believe he's doing
this to us.

406
00:29:09,151 --> 00:29:10,778
Good afternoon, Mrs. Wyler.

407
00:29:11,028 --> 00:29:13,489
I'm Bob Soames, County
Planning Commission.

408
00:29:13,697 --> 00:29:15,407
- But then you know that.
- Of course.

409
00:29:15,657 --> 00:29:17,034
It's a pleasure to meet you.

410
00:29:17,284 --> 00:29:18,744
It's been a long time coming.

411
00:29:18,994 --> 00:29:21,204
I brought friends.
I hope you don't mind.

412
00:29:21,454 --> 00:29:23,081
Not at all.

413
00:29:23,331 --> 00:29:25,959
Bob, are your friends
from the Sierra Club?

414
00:29:26,251 --> 00:29:28,503
Yes, as a matter of fact.
Quite a few.

415
00:29:28,711 --> 00:29:29,962
I hope they're welcome.

416
00:29:30,213 --> 00:29:31,672
I've supported them for years.

417
00:29:31,922 --> 00:29:33,549
Not only financially...

418
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:36,302
...but also in my heart.

419
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,137
Please join us.

420
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:41,431
I really don't think so.

421
00:29:41,723 --> 00:29:43,308
Please.

422
00:29:45,977 --> 00:29:46,811
All right.

423
00:29:47,562 --> 00:29:49,314
Thank you.

424
00:29:49,564 --> 00:29:52,525
I'm sorry, Ben. He promised me.

425
00:29:52,942 --> 00:29:55,611
Soames thinks he's a smart-ass.

426
00:29:56,112 --> 00:29:57,571
I'm not laughing.

427
00:29:57,905 --> 00:29:59,198
Cute little stores.

428
00:29:59,448 --> 00:30:02,659
"Zoning variances don't
count. " I say, " Come on-"

429
00:30:03,327 --> 00:30:05,037
What's it been, three weeks?

430
00:30:05,287 --> 00:30:07,706
Could you excuse me for
just a second?

431
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:10,625
What are you doing here?

432
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:11,876
Free eats, right?

433
00:30:13,503 --> 00:30:14,963
It's Mrs. Wyler's party.

434
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:17,089
- You don't wanna be here.
- That was bullshit...

435
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,425
...in your office, wasn't it?

436
00:30:19,634 --> 00:30:21,510
You don't care about me.

437
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,762
You work for Caxton.

438
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,932
You wanted to play pro football.

439
00:30:27,182 --> 00:30:31,269
Every year, there's a chance
you'd lose your job because of injury.

440
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,814
You players never grasp, it
is not a very secure job.

441
00:30:35,065 --> 00:30:37,108
A lot of us made you
rich, didn't we?

442
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,279
That's right, Brogan. I got rich.

443
00:30:41,487 --> 00:30:43,364
I'm getting richer all the time.

444
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:45,616
That's good, Steve.

445
00:30:47,409 --> 00:30:48,369
Come on, come on.

446
00:30:50,245 --> 00:30:52,706
You can afford it
when I kick your teeth!

447
00:30:52,956 --> 00:30:55,041
Do it, see what happens!
You're a has-been!

448
00:30:57,085 --> 00:30:59,170
- Cool it, man.
- Come on, goddamn it!

449
00:31:00,755 --> 00:31:01,881
That's intelligent.

450
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,426
Will you cool it?
You know Caxton's here.

451
00:31:05,635 --> 00:31:07,678
Hey, come on.

452
00:31:07,928 --> 00:31:08,846
Relax!

453
00:31:09,096 --> 00:31:11,348
You're finished in football!

454
00:31:11,557 --> 00:31:13,142
- Get him out!
- I'm out of here!

455
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:16,311
- You're not playing this right.
- I could give a fuck.

456
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,814
Wyler never mixed his
other businesses with the team.

457
00:31:19,022 --> 00:31:21,149
We played football.
We didn't sell real estate.

458
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:23,610
You're saying I'm lucky
to be off the team?

459
00:31:23,818 --> 00:31:25,612
It's a new goddamn ball game.

460
00:31:25,862 --> 00:31:28,614
That's all I'm telling you.
It's all bullshit!

461
00:31:28,823 --> 00:31:31,575
I don't belong here either.
It's a goddamn circus!

462
00:31:31,826 --> 00:31:33,911
I'm hearing weird things about you.

463
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:34,954
Like what?

464
00:31:35,162 --> 00:31:37,372
Like you might go
to work for Jake Wise.

465
00:31:37,581 --> 00:31:38,624
He offered me a job.

466
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:42,377
But you turned him down.
You're a smart kid. Wait!

467
00:31:42,627 --> 00:31:46,131
You're worried about money, but
don't screw around with Wise.

468
00:31:46,381 --> 00:31:48,550
I'm gonna get you a coaching job.

469
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,926
Just for the year.

470
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:52,595
I'm not ready to do
what you do. I'm a player!

471
00:31:52,845 --> 00:31:55,181
There's nothing here
for me now but shit!

472
00:31:55,389 --> 00:31:58,225
They won't pay me.
My shoulder's screwed up.

473
00:31:58,434 --> 00:31:59,852
Know what I'm telling myself?

474
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:03,689
Take Wise's money.
Take a damn vacation!

475
00:32:03,939 --> 00:32:06,983
I'll find his rich girl for him
and lay in the sun.

476
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:09,069
Have a good season, Hank.

477
00:32:10,987 --> 00:32:12,030
I'm on my own.

478
00:32:12,238 --> 00:32:14,699
Keep away from Wise, damn it!

479
00:33:23,888 --> 00:33:25,390
Jessie?

480
00:33:29,977 --> 00:33:31,228
I'm sorry.

481
00:33:32,062 --> 00:33:33,522
I'm sorry!

482
00:35:03,314 --> 00:35:04,857
Jessie?

483
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,196
You're Jessie Wyler, aren't you?

484
00:35:11,905 --> 00:35:13,448
I'm Terry Brogan.

485
00:35:14,283 --> 00:35:16,159
I played ball for the Outlaws.

486
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,245
The Outlaws don't interest me.

487
00:35:19,537 --> 00:35:21,539
I'm not playing this season.

488
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,628
There's not much going on here.
Where can I go to have a good time?

489
00:35:27,879 --> 00:35:30,131
The ferry leaves every morning.

490
00:35:33,842 --> 00:35:35,969
Can I buy you a drink or something?

491
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,430
How about a taco, huh?

492
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:46,563
I guess you can have anybody do that
for you in L.A., huh?

493
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:48,272
- What's that?
- A football player...

494
00:35:48,523 --> 00:35:50,942
...buy you a couple tacos and a beer.

495
00:35:53,027 --> 00:35:56,363
There are a lot better
things to do. Even in L.A.

496
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:01,451
What don't you like?
Football players...

497
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:03,662
...tacos or beer?

498
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,706
I like tacos and I like beer.

499
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:13,046
I should take the ferry, huh?

500
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:17,216
I figure if I keep talking,
you won't disappear.

501
00:36:20,594 --> 00:36:21,553
Bye!

502
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,055
You sure about that?

503
00:37:00,214 --> 00:37:02,466
Hey, Jake. How's it going?

504
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:05,594
No, nothing yet.

505
00:37:08,889 --> 00:37:12,684
I didn't expect to have signs
telling me where she is.

506
00:37:15,228 --> 00:37:17,731
Maybe I'll be outside
having a drink...

507
00:37:17,981 --> 00:37:21,860
...I'll look and out of nowhere
she'll be buying some fruit.

508
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,112
I'll call you in a few days.

509
00:37:25,655 --> 00:37:29,366
All right.
See you. Bye.

510
00:37:34,746 --> 00:37:36,790
Pretty slick, Roberto.

511
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:41,044
Okay, senor. cerveza, no glass.

512
00:37:41,753 --> 00:37:43,963
I've been hanging out here a lot, huh?

513
00:37:46,507 --> 00:37:48,551
Some hangout.

514
00:38:16,952 --> 00:38:18,162
Damn it!

515
00:38:27,504 --> 00:38:29,214
Where's that boat going?

516
00:38:29,422 --> 00:38:30,673
Tulum.

517
00:38:30,882 --> 00:38:32,967
- When's the next ferry?
- Six hours.

518
00:38:33,218 --> 00:38:34,052
Shit!

519
00:39:38,028 --> 00:39:40,113
Should I be afraid of you?

520
00:39:42,198 --> 00:39:43,658
I don't know.

521
00:39:47,912 --> 00:39:49,247
It's beautiful, huh?

522
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:52,374
If this were L.A., my stepfather
would've bought it.

523
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:55,127
Torn it up and built condominiums.

524
00:39:56,253 --> 00:40:00,132
Here, the land intimidates them.
They leave it in peace.

525
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:02,217
Some spot.

526
00:40:03,426 --> 00:40:06,638
It's nothing like the great
Maya cities of the Yucatan.

527
00:40:06,888 --> 00:40:08,056
Chichen Itza.

528
00:40:08,306 --> 00:40:10,224
Should have hidden there.

529
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:12,643
Is that what you're doing?
Hiding?

530
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,520
Yep.

531
00:40:18,732 --> 00:40:20,317
From you, right?

532
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,445
What do you mean?

533
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:27,199
Jake sent you.

534
00:40:31,536 --> 00:40:33,246
Maybe your mother did.

535
00:40:33,705 --> 00:40:37,208
I wouldn't know which one
had more to threaten you with.

536
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,795
You wanna know the truth?

537
00:40:42,004 --> 00:40:43,380
I came for the hell of it.

538
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:48,677
I wanted to get out of L.A.
A Caribbean island didn't sound too bad.

539
00:40:49,553 --> 00:40:52,430
Only trouble is, now I'm here
I find myself...

540
00:40:52,681 --> 00:40:55,600
...in the middle of something
I've no feeling for.

541
00:40:56,809 --> 00:40:59,312
Well, you're not doing this for free.

542
00:40:59,562 --> 00:41:02,064
You're getting paid well,
aren't you?

543
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,235
Which one are you working for?

544
00:41:07,444 --> 00:41:09,238
Which one knows you found me?

545
00:41:09,613 --> 00:41:11,740
Nobody knows anything, okay?

546
00:41:12,032 --> 00:41:13,116
Oh, sure!

547
00:41:13,366 --> 00:41:15,910
I figure, fuck them. You know?

548
00:41:16,786 --> 00:41:18,913
Fuck you too, lady.

549
00:41:20,832 --> 00:41:23,167
I loved your drawing.

550
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:08,167
I wanna talk to you.

551
00:42:10,044 --> 00:42:11,212
Talk.

552
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:15,007
Why should I believe
you won't tell Jake where I am?

553
00:42:16,258 --> 00:42:19,845
There are people who care what you
believe. I don't see them here.

554
00:42:25,183 --> 00:42:28,019
I have a broken shoulder,
both my knees are shot...

555
00:42:28,269 --> 00:42:29,729
...guys are crippling themselves...

556
00:42:29,979 --> 00:42:33,775
...so you can act like a
13-year-old runaway from Bel Air.

557
00:42:34,025 --> 00:42:36,068
I could give a shit what you believe.

558
00:42:43,033 --> 00:42:45,035
- How's Sam?
- Who?

559
00:42:45,244 --> 00:42:46,536
My dog.

560
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:49,080
I don't know.
Looks like he's fed.

561
00:42:52,834 --> 00:42:54,878
I shouldn't be afraid of you.

562
00:42:58,047 --> 00:42:58,965
When you leaving?

563
00:42:59,924 --> 00:43:03,552
I think 4:00.
I wish it were sooner.

564
00:43:05,554 --> 00:43:08,015
Never found where I live, did you?

565
00:43:11,184 --> 00:43:13,812
I don't think anybody could.

566
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,940
It's the prettiest place
on the island.

567
00:43:18,066 --> 00:43:20,276
Don't leave without saying goodbye.

568
00:43:23,571 --> 00:43:27,283
You take the highway out of town
to kilometre 19.

569
00:43:27,533 --> 00:43:29,702
When you see the three Tecate cans...

570
00:43:29,952 --> 00:43:32,788
...it's the first dirt road
on the right.

571
00:43:39,961 --> 00:43:42,172
Don't leave without saying goodbye.

572
00:43:45,258 --> 00:43:47,385
Don't leave without saying goodbye.

573
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,819
You don't have to worry about
the neighbors.

574
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:10,114
They were building homes here
when a storm hit.

575
00:44:10,364 --> 00:44:12,616
They all fell down except this one.

576
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:14,910
Waited for you, huh?

577
00:44:19,081 --> 00:44:20,582
Like a drink?

578
00:44:20,832 --> 00:44:22,626
All right. That'd be great.

579
00:44:30,216 --> 00:44:33,469
- Tequila okay?
- That's great.

580
00:44:35,554 --> 00:44:37,139
It's Maya.

581
00:44:37,723 --> 00:44:39,600
Third century, I think.

582
00:44:45,605 --> 00:44:46,606
No ice.

583
00:44:46,857 --> 00:44:48,275
That's all right.

584
00:44:48,567 --> 00:44:50,985
You don't have any electricity here?

585
00:44:53,238 --> 00:44:54,739
Propane.

586
00:45:03,539 --> 00:45:04,999
How'd you end up with Jake?

587
00:45:05,541 --> 00:45:07,459
The Palace, I guess.

588
00:45:10,337 --> 00:45:12,881
I wanted to be a
rock 'n' roll singer.

589
00:45:14,299 --> 00:45:18,303
Jake convinced me that rich girls
don't have the soul for it.

590
00:45:19,303 --> 00:45:23,015
Sounds like Jake. Always convincing
somebody of something.

591
00:45:24,225 --> 00:45:28,270
It seems I have the soul to
live with him, be his girlfriend.

592
00:45:28,604 --> 00:45:31,064
He never had anybody
like you before.

593
00:45:35,861 --> 00:45:39,155
You're a whole different class
for him.

594
00:45:40,698 --> 00:45:42,116
Not really.

595
00:45:42,367 --> 00:45:46,037
My family didn't get to own most
of Bel Air by being honest.

596
00:45:46,954 --> 00:45:48,956
Jake always thought I was his luck.

597
00:45:49,206 --> 00:45:51,584
I helped him outthink people
like my family.

598
00:45:51,834 --> 00:45:55,003
I know why he wanted you.

599
00:45:55,212 --> 00:45:56,880
But why were you with him?

600
00:45:58,423 --> 00:46:02,093
I liked that my being with him
made a lot of people crazy.

601
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,430
Like your mom?

602
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:08,891
It even frightened her.

603
00:46:09,142 --> 00:46:12,311
And that was really something to
finally pull off.

604
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:18,567
If only my brother had done
that and not by killing himself.

605
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,030
Your brother killed himself?

606
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:26,282
I guess.

607
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,913
He got into drugs
for the same reason I did.

608
00:46:32,163 --> 00:46:34,832
To get away from our terrible life.

609
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:37,960
Did his dying make you stop?

610
00:46:42,965 --> 00:46:44,132
Jake did.

611
00:46:44,591 --> 00:46:45,801
Jake did?

612
00:46:47,928 --> 00:46:52,348
After I was with him awhile, it became
very important to him that I stop.

613
00:46:52,557 --> 00:46:55,143
Wouldn't leave me
alone until I quit.

614
00:46:55,393 --> 00:46:57,979
The truth is I wanted to quit.

615
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:03,692
When I did, I didn't need
Jake anymore.

616
00:47:04,443 --> 00:47:06,278
Bet that kind of threw him.

617
00:47:11,283 --> 00:47:14,702
He said the only way I could
get away was to kill him.

618
00:47:16,829 --> 00:47:18,623
Well, you almost did.

619
00:47:21,292 --> 00:47:23,002
Not really.

620
00:47:24,503 --> 00:47:26,755
I'm gonna stay away from Jake.

621
00:47:27,756 --> 00:47:28,966
And my mother.

622
00:47:30,175 --> 00:47:31,760
Good.

623
00:47:40,101 --> 00:47:41,519
I ought to get going.

624
00:47:44,564 --> 00:47:45,940
Why?

625
00:47:49,318 --> 00:47:51,153
What'd you come here for?
