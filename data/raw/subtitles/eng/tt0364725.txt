1
00:00:25,135 --> 00:00:27,126
Tired of the same old you?

2
00:00:27,214 --> 00:00:31,127
Tired of being out of shape
and out of luck with the opposite sex?

3
00:00:31,214 --> 00:00:34,684
Tired of being overweight
and under-attractive?

4
00:00:34,774 --> 00:00:36,253
Yeah.

5
00:00:36,334 --> 00:00:38,006
Oh, hello.

6
00:00:38,094 --> 00:00:43,407
I'm White Goodman, owner, operator
and founder of Globo Gym America Corp.

7
00:00:43,494 --> 00:00:47,406
I'm here to tell ya that you don't have
to be stuck with what you've got.

8
00:00:47,494 --> 00:00:49,961
Hey, Rory. Looking good.

9
00:00:50,053 --> 00:00:55,333
At Globo Gym we that understand "ugliness"
and "fatness" are genetic disorders,

10
00:00:55,413 --> 00:00:57,688
much like baldness or necrophilia,

11
00:00:57,774 --> 00:01:01,687
and it's only your fault if you don't hate
yourself enough to do something about it.

12
00:01:02,773 --> 00:01:05,367
That's where we come in.

13
00:01:05,454 --> 00:01:08,571
Globo Gym employs
a highly trained, quasi-cultural staff

14
00:01:08,653 --> 00:01:11,486
of personal alteration specialists.

15
00:01:11,573 --> 00:01:14,406
With our competitively priced
onsite cosmetic surgery,

16
00:01:14,494 --> 00:01:17,565
we can turn that Frankenstein
you see in the mirror every morning

17
00:01:17,653 --> 00:01:19,644
into a Franken-fine.

18
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:22,523
Of course, you'll still be you in a legal sense,

19
00:01:22,613 --> 00:01:25,207
but think of it as a thinner,
more attractive, better you

20
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,284
than you could ever become without us.

21
00:01:27,373 --> 00:01:31,127
How do I know?
Well, I'm not only the founder of Globo Gym,

22
00:01:31,212 --> 00:01:33,124
I'm also a client.

23
00:01:35,572 --> 00:01:40,441
That's me, six years and 600lbs ago,
before I knew how much I hated myself.

24
00:01:40,532 --> 00:01:43,001
That all changed once I founded Globo Gym.

25
00:01:43,092 --> 00:01:49,566
But don'tjust take my word for it. Listen
to these Globo gymers tell you how it is...

26
00:01:52,893 --> 00:01:55,487
That feels good.

27
00:01:55,572 --> 00:01:57,767
Oh, the tickle machine.

28
00:02:00,853 --> 00:02:02,968
Crash, no. Crash, out.

29
00:02:03,052 --> 00:02:05,441
Bad dog. No grundle.

30
00:02:07,572 --> 00:02:09,722
Come on down and join the winning team,

31
00:02:09,812 --> 00:02:12,929
because here at Globo Gym,
we're better than you.

32
00:02:13,012 --> 00:02:15,128
And we know it.

33
00:02:15,212 --> 00:02:17,203
Spare me.

34
00:02:25,332 --> 00:02:28,529
Mr La Fleur, this is Doris
from the Department of Water and Power.

35
00:02:28,612 --> 00:02:31,922
We've been trying to reach you,
but your phone was disconnected.

36
00:02:32,012 --> 00:02:35,401
We'll be shutting off
your water and power at 5pm today

37
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:40,690
due to an eight-month overdue account.
Thank you and have a nice day.

38
00:02:40,772 --> 00:02:44,810
This is Seth from Videorama.
The following DVDs are now overdue.

39
00:02:44,891 --> 00:02:50,841
<i>Drunken Hussies 3, Backdoor Patrol 5</i>
and <i>Mona Lisa Smile.</i> Thank you.

40
00:03:05,611 --> 00:03:08,444
Come on, baby, be there.
Be there.

41
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:18,240
It's gonna be a good day.
I'm proud of you.

42
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:34,246
We're just around the corner.
My gym's here. I promise we're almost there.

43
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,127
You guys are lifesavers.

44
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,122
I appreciate the effort.
Don't pull a hammy over it.

45
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:47,725
Gimme that garbage.
Shouldn't you be on a treadmill?

46
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,399
Hey, Peter.

47
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:56,039
- How's my little tax shelter this morning?
- Everything's shipshape.

48
00:03:56,129 --> 00:03:59,405
Don't hold out on me. What's happening?

49
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,403
It's just I'm trying
this new voicemail-dating thing.

50
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:08,642
And, like, no one's even left me a message,
and it's been almost two months.

51
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:11,198
There's someone out there for everybody.

52
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,882
- You think?
- Absolutely.

53
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:17,485
In some cases, there's two somebodies for
one person. I like to call that "the jackpot".

54
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:19,560
See you later, dater.

55
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:23,365
- Hey, Peter.
- Hey, Gordon.

56
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:25,758
- I'm wailing on my glutes.
- Sounds great.

57
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:29,888
I'm gonna shock the biceps later,
then some cardio. Keep the body guessing.

58
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:34,201
- I like to keep my body guessing.
- Sure. I wanted to ask you something.

59
00:04:34,288 --> 00:04:36,883
- Did you catch the game last night?
- Can I say yes?

60
00:04:36,969 --> 00:04:39,483
Amateur curling championships
on ESPN8.

61
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:42,845
- I had no idea.
- You missed a doozy. Really great stuff.

62
00:04:42,928 --> 00:04:45,727
I feel dumb for asking,
but how did you hear about it?

63
00:04:45,808 --> 00:04:49,323
<i>- OSQ. Obscure Sports Quarterly.</i>
- Of course, the <i>OSQ.</i>

64
00:04:49,409 --> 00:04:51,968
Started reading it in college, for the chicks.

65
00:04:52,049 --> 00:04:54,642
- I'm glad that worked out for you.
- Thanks, Peter.

66
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:57,196
- Bye.
- Love the orange and love the headphones.

67
00:04:57,288 --> 00:04:59,757
When I come back,
I want you on a different machine.

68
00:05:05,248 --> 00:05:07,523
- You need a spot?
- I'm cool, Pete.

69
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:10,441
OK, come on. Let's get this out of here.
You OK?

70
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:14,646
- You're like a human Chinese puzzle.
- Thanks, Pete.

71
00:05:14,728 --> 00:05:16,958
All that weight is dangerous.

72
00:05:17,048 --> 00:05:21,405
It'll be worth it when I make the cheerleading
squad. Prove to Amber that I'm not a loser.

73
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:26,083
Hang on a second. You wanna become
a cheerleader to prove you are not a loser?

74
00:05:26,168 --> 00:05:28,557
Yeah. Why?

75
00:05:28,648 --> 00:05:31,321
Nothing. High school's
changed a bit since I was a kid.

76
00:05:31,408 --> 00:05:35,286
Plus, all anyone ever remembers is
what happened at last year's tryouts.

77
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,359
I'm the laughing stock of the school.

78
00:05:37,448 --> 00:05:42,397
I'm sure it's not that big of a deal.
What happened at last year's tryouts?

79
00:05:43,087 --> 00:05:45,442
Justin Redmond. Ready and super-psyched.

80
00:05:45,967 --> 00:05:48,959
- Hey, Amber.
- Hi, Justin. Good luck.

81
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:52,801
Good luck to you, making yourjudgments.

82
00:05:52,888 --> 00:05:56,323
And from the girls' line,
we need girl number

83
00:05:56,807 --> 00:05:58,843
00, Martha Johnstone.

84
00:06:06,047 --> 00:06:08,435
Toss to hands, liberty and cradle out, OK?

85
00:06:09,606 --> 00:06:11,995
I'm not wearing any panties.

86
00:06:14,047 --> 00:06:16,242
Ready? One, two.

87
00:06:19,007 --> 00:06:20,998
Liberty, ready?

88
00:06:32,407 --> 00:06:35,000
- Dude.
- Can he breathe?

89
00:06:41,126 --> 00:06:43,037
- Wow.
- Yeah.

90
00:06:43,126 --> 00:06:47,483
- It was the worst.
- Don't worry about this Amber situation.

91
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:50,557
- It'll all work itself out in the end.
- Thanks, Pete.

92
00:06:50,646 --> 00:06:52,875
You'll laugh at this one day.
I'm laughing.

93
00:06:52,966 --> 00:06:55,958
Go at your own pace.
That's what it's there for.

94
00:06:57,966 --> 00:07:01,595
- Who goes there?
- It's me. It's Peter.

95
00:07:06,046 --> 00:07:08,878
'Tis about the matter of payment
for me membership.

96
00:07:08,965 --> 00:07:10,877
Steve be a touch short this month.

97
00:07:10,966 --> 00:07:13,035
That's all right.
Just pay me when you get the money.

98
00:07:13,126 --> 00:07:17,357
The dread pirate Steve be in no man's debt.
I'll make a barter with you.

99
00:07:17,445 --> 00:07:23,156
In exchange for your kindness,
I'll be splitting me buried treasure with you.

100
00:07:23,245 --> 00:07:25,201
Once I find it, that be.

101
00:07:25,285 --> 00:07:30,313
I'm flattered by the gesture, but
a couple of bucks here and there will be fine.

102
00:07:30,405 --> 00:07:32,396
Thanks, Peter.

103
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,044
- I'll be on the StairMaster.
- OK, Steve.

104
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:38,913
- Next time, maybe just say "hello".
- Gar.

105
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:46,602
Hello.

106
00:07:46,684 --> 00:07:49,517
It's not my birthday till next month,
but terrific.

107
00:07:49,605 --> 00:07:51,720
I'm so sorry. Hi.

108
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:55,593
I'm Katherine Veatch with Hawthorne Stone.

109
00:07:56,244 --> 00:07:58,599
- Your bank?
- Right. My bank.

110
00:07:58,685 --> 00:08:02,997
- You are very attractive for a banker.
- Thank you. I'm not a banker, I'm a lawyer.

111
00:08:03,084 --> 00:08:06,555
Really? What kind of law
are you involved in, pretty eyes?

112
00:08:06,644 --> 00:08:09,033
Sexual harassment, mostly.

113
00:08:09,124 --> 00:08:13,197
But I also handle real estate and tax law,
which is why I'm here.

114
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:16,640
- This place is in default?
- No. You're in foreclosure.

115
00:08:16,724 --> 00:08:19,602
You were in default
when we sent you delinquency notices.

116
00:08:19,684 --> 00:08:22,721
- I thought those were just warnings.
- They were warnings.

117
00:08:22,804 --> 00:08:27,514
No one warned me. What happens now?
I make my payments out to somebody else?

118
00:08:27,604 --> 00:08:31,153
You have 30 days to pay the balance
of your mortgage, or you lose your gym.

119
00:08:31,243 --> 00:08:34,714
Perfect. What's the damage?
What do I owe you?

120
00:08:34,803 --> 00:08:36,476
$50,000.

121
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:42,682
Personal cheque gonna be OK? Might have
to wait till the end of the month to cash her?

122
00:08:42,763 --> 00:08:47,201
I do have to switch some funds. The charity
I like to work with is gonna take a hit.

123
00:08:47,283 --> 00:08:50,639
Mr La Fleur, I can assure you
this is a very serious situation.

124
00:08:50,723 --> 00:08:54,272
Yeah.
This is extremely serious, Mrs Veatch.

125
00:08:54,363 --> 00:08:59,517
It's Ms. I'll need to review all of your financial
statements and assess any tax liabilities.

126
00:08:59,603 --> 00:09:02,401
Absolutely.
I don't know how you say "Ms" for "Mr",

127
00:09:02,483 --> 00:09:05,156
but if there was a "Ms Mr",
I'm a Ms as well.

128
00:09:05,923 --> 00:09:09,996
You do keep financial records?
Invoices, revenue reports, taxable income.

129
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:13,199
You kidding? I got a closet full of 'em.
I call 'em keepers.

130
00:09:17,762 --> 00:09:21,472
- Problem is I've never really filed them.
- No kidding.

131
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:24,873
Just out of curiosity,
who would want to buy this place anyway?

132
00:09:24,963 --> 00:09:27,636
Come on, squeeze it, squeeze it.

133
00:09:27,722 --> 00:09:31,510
Yeah, come on, come on. Get it up.

134
00:09:31,602 --> 00:09:34,912
One more, bitch. One more, bitch.

135
00:09:35,002 --> 00:09:37,675
Yeah. Yeah.

136
00:09:37,762 --> 00:09:40,151
- Now you're my bitch.
- Yeah.

137
00:09:42,242 --> 00:09:44,711
Yeah, baby.

138
00:09:44,803 --> 00:09:48,431
Involuntary spasm.
Look at the show. Enjoy the show.

139
00:09:50,402 --> 00:09:54,281
This a bad time? I could come back.
Looks like some real dude sweat going on.

140
00:09:54,362 --> 00:09:58,560
Add three pounds to the scales in the
women's locker room before you go home.

141
00:09:58,642 --> 00:10:03,272
Refreshment?
I've got protein paste, carb laxative...

142
00:10:03,841 --> 00:10:07,356
- Suffocated kumquat, perhaps?
- I'm trying to cut down on those.

143
00:10:07,442 --> 00:10:10,001
- They're good. They are good.
- Know what you mean.

144
00:10:10,082 --> 00:10:12,073
Walk with me.

145
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:18,591
Hey, Brianna.
Cellulite seminar tomorrow, 0600.

146
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:22,631
Nice job, Susie.
You call that a sit-up?

147
00:10:22,721 --> 00:10:25,077
Don't slack, Trevor.
I'm watching you.

148
00:10:25,161 --> 00:10:26,833
There's a good energy in the gym.

149
00:10:26,921 --> 00:10:28,799
Let me guess why you're here, Pete.

150
00:10:28,881 --> 00:10:31,679
Because I bought out
the second mortgage on your gym.

151
00:10:31,761 --> 00:10:36,551
You've got 30 days to make $50,000,
or your gym becomes my gym.

152
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:38,757
I know we've had our differences...

153
00:10:38,841 --> 00:10:42,436
Is that what you call
sleeping with three of my female trainers?

154
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,510
It was one night.

155
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,957
Or the strip-o-gram you sent me
for the Globo Gym one-year anniversary?

156
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,317
- It was meant to be congratulatory.
- It was also a man.

157
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:52,595
Let's not get hung up on details.

158
00:10:52,681 --> 00:10:55,240
- We're both professionals.
- Really?

159
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,278
Last I heard, my gym makes money.
Yours doesn't.

160
00:10:58,361 --> 00:11:02,035
My gym's worth over $4 million.
Your gym isn't worth four.

161
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,318
I have shareholders.
You haven't even got cupholders.

162
00:11:06,401 --> 00:11:08,630
- Why would I want cupholders?
- The point is

163
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,632
Globo Gym is a beacon
of human physical perfection.

164
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,711
A benchmark in the fitness community.

165
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:18,555
Your "gym" is a skid mark
on the underpants of society.

166
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,111
See, Peter, I wasn't born
expecting the world to do me any favours.

167
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,192
I earned this body
and I built this temple

168
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,829
out of nothing more than
a little can-do attitude and elbow grease.

169
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,639
And a large inheritance
from my father, Earl Goodman.

170
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,590
So if I choose to level Average Joe's to build
a parking structure for my members, so be it.

171
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,829
There's nothing you can do about it.

172
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:45,788
In 30 days, I'll be bulldozing that shit-heap
you call a gym into permanent nothingness.

173
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:51,033
I can only hope that you, and the mongrel
race that comprise your membership,

174
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,679
are inside it when I do.

175
00:11:54,319 --> 00:11:56,469
Show Mr La Fleur out.

176
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,550
Turn it up high, Reggie.

177
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,870
I wanna burn.

178
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:08,349
So that's the deal. We got 30 days
to raise $50,000, or Average Joe's is history.

179
00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:10,873
I got ten minutes. I'll open it up to some Q&A.

180
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,754
No need to raise your hands,
it's an open forum. OK, Owen, kick us off.

181
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,433
Yes, Peter, - and I'm just spitballing here -

182
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,990
but why don't we pay it off
in Canadian dollars and save some money?

183
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,071
Just so you know, if that's a route
you want to follow, it's 50,000 American.

184
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,390
It would be 70,000, roughly, Canadian dollars.

185
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:36,347
- How are we gonna come up with $120,000?
- Owen, you don't add them together.

186
00:12:36,438 --> 00:12:40,556
Technically, Peter, I'm sorry to say this,
but it's more like $73,313...

187
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,187
It doesn't matter. We can't come up
with $50,000. We're screwed.

188
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:46,030
Gar.

189
00:12:46,118 --> 00:12:51,272
- It's an insurmountable amount of money.
- No, it's not insurmountable. Come on.

190
00:12:51,598 --> 00:12:54,192
We can'tjust sit back
and let Globo Gym take us over.

191
00:12:54,278 --> 00:12:57,236
Average Joe's is too important.

192
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,513
Where do you go
when your wife changes the locks?

193
00:12:59,598 --> 00:13:01,508
- Average Joe's.
- Right.

194
00:13:01,598 --> 00:13:05,307
Dwight, Owen, what will you do
if Joe's goes under? Work at the airport?

195
00:13:05,397 --> 00:13:09,152
- I ain't working at no airport again.
- No. Cos you hated it.

196
00:13:09,237 --> 00:13:13,355
And, Steve, where do you go
to do whatever it is that you do?

197
00:13:13,438 --> 00:13:17,715
- Gar. Joe's be the only place for Steve.
- Gar. You're right.

198
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:22,430
Do you see? There's no way I can go
back to working out at my high school.

199
00:13:22,517 --> 00:13:26,113
They'd laugh at me there.
Lock me in lockers, make me eat clay.

200
00:13:26,197 --> 00:13:28,950
But not here, not at Joe's.

201
00:13:29,038 --> 00:13:33,793
I need this place.
You guys need this place. Come on.

202
00:13:36,158 --> 00:13:38,990
I got it. I know how we can raise the money.

203
00:13:39,077 --> 00:13:41,591
- How?
- Car wash.

204
00:13:57,396 --> 00:14:00,833
What are the chances?
Same day, right across the street?

205
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,713
The girls beat us fair and square.

206
00:14:02,836 --> 00:14:08,628
I am gonna be a gentleman about it and
congratulate every one of them, personally.

207
00:14:08,716 --> 00:14:13,153
Guys. Not to be a nay-sayer or anything,
but the only customer we've had

208
00:14:13,236 --> 00:14:17,593
is that weird guy
who keeps paying Justin to wash his truck.

209
00:14:22,276 --> 00:14:27,111
That's it, boy.
Get in there nice and deep, like.

210
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:32,228
- That's not good.
- Gar. This sucks.

211
00:14:43,076 --> 00:14:45,954
Relax, Justin, it's just a cutout.

212
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:50,225
At Globo Gym,
we're better than you and we know it.

213
00:14:50,315 --> 00:14:53,069
Sign up now.

214
00:14:53,155 --> 00:14:55,305
Do you smell that fitness? I do.

215
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,751
Rock it and shock it, baby.

216
00:14:57,835 --> 00:14:59,792
You gotta burn it to earn it.

217
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:03,663
- What's in the envelope?
- Free 30-day memberships to Globo Gym.

218
00:15:03,755 --> 00:15:07,430
- Cool.
- It's ajoke. He sent it to us as an insult.

219
00:15:07,515 --> 00:15:11,349
Maybe we could sell 'em for cash
cos the car wash cost us money.

220
00:15:11,435 --> 00:15:13,903
- We're further away from saving this place?
- Yes.

221
00:15:13,995 --> 00:15:16,509
- We'll never raise enough money.
- This blows.

222
00:15:16,595 --> 00:15:18,506
Guys, I know this is tough to take,

223
00:15:18,595 --> 00:15:22,474
but if an impromptu car wash
doesn't raise us the $50,000 we need,

224
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,590
I guess itjust isn't in the cards.

225
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:30,830
Trust me here. If there was any way in
the world we could raise $50,000 in 30 days,

226
00:15:30,914 --> 00:15:33,144
short of robbing a bank, I'd do it.

227
00:15:33,234 --> 00:15:35,430
We could sell blood and semen.

228
00:15:35,515 --> 00:15:37,266
What? Not mixed together.

229
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:39,470
Guys, I love the enthusiasm,

230
00:15:39,554 --> 00:15:42,910
I love the energy here,
but we're looking at this the wrong way.

231
00:15:42,994 --> 00:15:45,554
Let's celebrate the good times
that was Joe's.

232
00:15:45,635 --> 00:15:48,910
We gotta start looking at this Irish-wake style.

233
00:15:51,795 --> 00:15:55,548
Let me be the first
to say goodbye to Average Joe's.

234
00:15:55,634 --> 00:15:59,593
We gave it a hell of a run, guys.
Now let's try to have some fun.

235
00:15:59,674 --> 00:16:02,984
I'm gonna put on "The Thong Song",
and we'll tear this place apart.

236
00:16:03,074 --> 00:16:05,304
Wait, wait. Peter. Peter.

237
00:16:05,954 --> 00:16:08,104
We could play dodgeball.

238
00:16:08,194 --> 00:16:12,664
That's very nice, Gordon, but everyone's
tired. Playing a game isn't gonna help.

239
00:16:12,753 --> 00:16:18,305
There's a tournament in Las Vegas.
I feel so dumb I didn't think about it before.

240
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,191
I read about
the Las Vegas International Dodgeball Open

241
00:16:21,274 --> 00:16:23,424
every year in <i>Obscure Sports Quarterly.</i>

242
00:16:23,514 --> 00:16:26,028
Of course. That's a totally common thing.

243
00:16:26,114 --> 00:16:30,186
The best part is it's open to any team
that wins a regional qualifying match.

244
00:16:30,273 --> 00:16:35,825
- How is dodgeball gonna get us the $50,000?
- They have a cash prize for the winner.

245
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:38,791
- How much?
- $50,000.

246
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:41,865
Guys, we are not gonna get $50,000
for playing dodgeball.

247
00:16:41,953 --> 00:16:45,025
- Why not?
- None of us know how to play dodgeball.

248
00:16:45,113 --> 00:16:49,504
I do. We played it in PE last year.
They showed us this film about it.

249
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:52,790
- Can you get your hands on that film?
- Sure, I guess.

250
00:16:52,873 --> 00:16:55,433
Can we please try to be serious
here for one second?

251
00:16:55,513 --> 00:17:00,633
You said anything we could do to raise
the money. This is that anything. This is it.

252
00:17:00,713 --> 00:17:03,988
Come on, show of hands.
Who wants to play dodgeball?

253
00:17:04,673 --> 00:17:06,948
Come on.

254
00:17:09,352 --> 00:17:11,741
Come on, Pete.

255
00:17:12,752 --> 00:17:15,903
You guys had me at blood and semen.
Come here.

256
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:22,389
You want it, don't you, fat boy?

257
00:17:22,472 --> 00:17:24,349
You want that doughnut.

258
00:17:24,432 --> 00:17:27,105
Go ahead and have a bite.

259
00:17:27,192 --> 00:17:30,980
Just a little bite.
One little bite won't hurt you.

260
00:17:36,152 --> 00:17:37,949
Momma.

261
00:17:38,672 --> 00:17:43,348
- Sir, Katherine Veatch is here to see you.
- Give me 30 seconds and send her in.

262
00:17:43,432 --> 00:17:44,910
Yes, sir.

263
00:17:59,752 --> 00:18:01,743
Thank you.

264
00:18:06,671 --> 00:18:10,789
Hello, Katherine. Good to see you.
I didn't know you were dropping by.

265
00:18:10,871 --> 00:18:14,261
- You asked me to come over.
- Did I?

266
00:18:15,431 --> 00:18:18,184
Are you reading the dictionary?

267
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:23,306
You caught me. I like to break
a mental sweat too. Grab a chair.

268
00:18:23,391 --> 00:18:29,306
So, I trust everything's going swimmingly
with our acquisition of Average Joe's?

269
00:18:29,391 --> 00:18:33,941
So far, yeah. There's a lot to do over there,
so I should probably get back.

270
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:37,865
- That is a really interesting painting.
- Thank you.

271
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:43,184
Yeah, that's me, taking the bull by the horns.
It's how I handle my business.

272
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,306
It's a metaphor.

273
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,429
- I get it.
- But that actually happened, though.

274
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:54,379
Anyway, we're a pretty tight-knit tribe here,
but there's always room for one more squaw.

275
00:18:54,471 --> 00:18:58,463
So, please, whatever you do,
don't think of me as your boss.

276
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,018
- I don't.
- I don't want to get into a formal thing.

277
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,101
I'm White, you know.

278
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,986
W-h-i-t.

279
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,263
E.

280
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,944
Thanks, Mr Goodman,
but I'm contracted by the bank.

281
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:13,100
They just assigned me to your account.

282
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:18,946
Right, well. You work for the bank. Bank
works for me so, ipso fact, I'm your boss.

283
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:25,059
Point is, I would love to see your pretty
little bone structure around here some more.

284
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:27,220
There's no reason we need to be shackled

285
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:31,349
by the strictures of
the employee-employer relationship.

286
00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:33,898
Unless you're into that sort of thing.

287
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,663
In which case,
I got some shackles in the back.

288
00:19:36,749 --> 00:19:40,298
I'm just kidding.
But seriously, I've got 'em.

289
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:43,028
I'm just doing my job, Mr Goodman.

290
00:19:43,109 --> 00:19:48,229
In fact, I actually prefer it over there.

291
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:52,018
Really? You like it with those freaks
over there in Loser-Town?

292
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:55,226
They're not freaks.
They're people, just like you and me.

293
00:19:56,549 --> 00:19:58,665
People?

294
00:19:58,748 --> 00:20:01,217
"People, just like you and me."
Oh, man.

295
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:04,984
That is what I love about you, Kate.
You've got a "personality".

296
00:20:05,868 --> 00:20:12,865
That is rich. A real sauciness
that I find extremely attractive.

297
00:20:14,788 --> 00:20:17,018
We should mate.

298
00:20:17,108 --> 00:20:18,827
- What?
- Date.

299
00:20:18,908 --> 00:20:21,866
We should date some time. Socially.
Go out and kick it.

300
00:20:23,668 --> 00:20:25,545
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

301
00:20:25,628 --> 00:20:28,859
I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.

302
00:20:29,988 --> 00:20:33,185
In some cultures, they only eat vomit.

303
00:20:33,308 --> 00:20:36,937
I never been there,
but I read about it in a book.

304
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:40,623
I'm sorry, Mr Goodman.
I don't date clients.

305
00:20:42,227 --> 00:20:43,946
I get it.

306
00:20:44,027 --> 00:20:47,464
Don't crap where you eat. I understand.

307
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:51,257
Me'Shell.
Please escort Ms Veatch out.

308
00:20:52,868 --> 00:20:56,860
And, Katherine, make sure
my acquisition of that gym goes smoothly.

309
00:20:56,948 --> 00:21:00,098
They're up to something over there.
I can smell it.

310
00:21:07,027 --> 00:21:12,704
Ûber-American Instructional films,
teaching America's youth since 1938.

311
00:21:19,187 --> 00:21:20,984
Hey, there, Timmy.

312
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:24,662
Holy mackerel, mister.
You scared the jeepers out of me.

313
00:21:24,747 --> 00:21:28,456
How'd you like to take a break
from that fine lead-based paint,

314
00:21:28,547 --> 00:21:29,899
and learn about dodgeball?

315
00:21:29,987 --> 00:21:31,817
Boy, would I.

316
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,784
- Where am I, mister?
- You're in a Chinese opium den, Timmy.

317
00:21:38,866 --> 00:21:42,223
This is where dodgeball
was invented in the 15th century,

318
00:21:42,306 --> 00:21:44,536
by opium-addicted Chinamen.

319
00:21:44,626 --> 00:21:47,982
Back then, the Chinamen threw
severed human heads at each another

320
00:21:48,066 --> 00:21:51,297
instead of the ADAA-approved balls
we use today.

321
00:21:53,786 --> 00:21:54,821
ADAA?

322
00:21:54,906 --> 00:21:58,455
That's the American Dodgeball
Association of America.

323
00:21:58,546 --> 00:22:03,904
Dodgeball is played with six players
on each team, and six rubber balls.

324
00:22:03,986 --> 00:22:07,058
The object of the game
is to eliminate the opposing players.

325
00:22:07,146 --> 00:22:11,458
Once all the players on one team are
eliminated, the opposing team wins.

326
00:22:11,546 --> 00:22:15,459
Wow. I can't wait
to get the fellas together and play.

327
00:22:17,346 --> 00:22:20,143
Hang on a second there, sport.

328
00:22:20,226 --> 00:22:23,217
- Patches O'Houlihan.
- That's right, Timmy.

329
00:22:23,305 --> 00:22:29,096
Patches O'Houlihan. Seven-time ADAA
All-Star is here to take you the rest of the way.

330
00:22:29,185 --> 00:22:32,700
- Jeepers. Really?
- You betcha, champ.

331
00:22:33,106 --> 00:22:37,019
If you catch a ball that's thrown at you
before it hits the ground,

332
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:40,336
the player who threw that ball is out,
not you.

333
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:45,055
Plus, another player from your team
gets to come back into the game.

334
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:48,535
- It's a two-player swing.
- Thanks, Patches.

335
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:51,378
I can't wait to start my own team at school.

336
00:22:51,465 --> 00:22:53,501
Attaboy, Tiger.

337
00:22:53,585 --> 00:22:59,023
But remember, dodgeball is a sport
of violence, exclusion and degradation.

338
00:22:59,104 --> 00:23:02,097
So, when you're picking players in gym class,

339
00:23:02,185 --> 00:23:06,177
remember to pick the bigger,
stronger kids for your team.

340
00:23:06,265 --> 00:23:11,657
That way, you can all gang up
on the weaker ones, like Winston here.

341
00:23:16,464 --> 00:23:19,262
Nice one, son.
You'll be an all-star yet.

342
00:23:19,344 --> 00:23:22,780
Just remember the five Ds of dodgeball.

343
00:23:22,865 --> 00:23:25,537
Dodge, duck, dip, dive and

344
00:23:25,624 --> 00:23:27,182
dodge.

345
00:23:27,265 --> 00:23:30,176
Till next time.
This is Patches O'Houlihan,

346
00:23:30,265 --> 00:23:34,815
saying, "Take care of your balls
and they'll take care of you."

347
00:23:36,384 --> 00:23:39,103
OK, guys. Any questions? Great.

348
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:43,860
I signed us up for the sub-regional qualifier
tomorrow at the Waldorf rec centre.

349
00:23:43,944 --> 00:23:45,821
But we haven't even practised yet.

350
00:23:45,904 --> 00:23:49,579
We have to qualify for the Vegas Open.
Tomorrow's regional's our last chance.

351
00:23:49,664 --> 00:23:54,897
Everyone, just relax. I've always found
the best way to learn a sport is by playing it.

352
00:23:54,984 --> 00:23:57,657
If anyone needs me,
I'll be in my office doing Mad Libs.

353
00:23:57,744 --> 00:23:59,893
Thanks, Peter. Appreciate that a lot.

354
00:23:59,983 --> 00:24:01,814
OK, I think everybody knows...

355
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:09,102
- Don't you have an office of your own?
- Yes, I do have an office.

356
00:24:09,183 --> 00:24:11,936
A very nice office
with a view and air-conditioning.

357
00:24:12,023 --> 00:24:15,221
- Rub it in.
- What I don't have in my office is a closet

358
00:24:15,303 --> 00:24:20,058
of 30 years of financial transactions,
devoid of any filing system known to man.

359
00:24:20,143 --> 00:24:23,931
Hard to believe I only got a semester
ofjunior college under my belt.

360
00:24:24,023 --> 00:24:28,813
Do you realise you haven't collected
any membership fees in 13 months?

361
00:24:28,903 --> 00:24:32,736
I'm curious. Is it strictly apathy,
or do you really not have a goal in life?

362
00:24:32,823 --> 00:24:36,418
I found that if you have a goal,
you might not reach it.

363
00:24:36,503 --> 00:24:40,018
But if you don't have one,
then you are never disappointed.

364
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:44,415
I gotta tell you, it feels phenomenal.

365
00:24:44,503 --> 00:24:47,653
I guess that makes sense, in a really sad way.

366
00:24:47,743 --> 00:24:50,382
Sad? You wanna know what's sad?

367
00:24:50,462 --> 00:24:53,216
Six grown men playing dodgeball.

368
00:24:53,622 --> 00:24:57,615
Since I'm here, I'm gonna go ahead
and do some abs, go shock it up.

369
00:24:57,702 --> 00:25:01,252
I like to work out all the time
for this kind of sporting event.

370
00:25:01,342 --> 00:25:04,062
Gotta be limber and loose.
That's the only way to play.

371
00:25:04,142 --> 00:25:08,579
Hey, you guys take vitamins?
I take vitamins all the time...

372
00:25:10,902 --> 00:25:13,177
Dodgeball, eh?

373
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:18,097
If Peter La Fleur thinks a few
red rubber balls can save his sorry gym,

374
00:25:18,182 --> 00:25:20,935
he's in for quite a surprise.

375
00:25:28,822 --> 00:25:31,699
- Sorry I'm late, guys.
- Hey, Pete.

376
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:35,933
- Bad morning, boss?
- They usually follow good nights, Dwight.

377
00:25:36,022 --> 00:25:38,091
- Hey, Gord, your family's here.
- Where?

378
00:25:38,181 --> 00:25:40,332
- Right over there.
- Great.

379
00:25:40,422 --> 00:25:43,698
She knows I don't like it
when she watches me. I get all nervous.

380
00:25:43,781 --> 00:25:46,535
- Kids take after you.
- Yeah. She's their stepmother.

381
00:25:46,621 --> 00:25:49,580
I remarried three years ago.
An Internet mail-order thing.

382
00:25:49,661 --> 00:25:53,701
- How's that working out for you?
- Really great. Really great.

383
00:25:53,781 --> 00:25:55,180
Hey, honey.

384
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:59,779
L for love. Good times.

385
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,851
L for love? That doesn't mean love...

386
00:26:01,941 --> 00:26:04,409
People have different translations for things.

387
00:26:04,501 --> 00:26:08,733
That's a special bond that you have with
your mail-order wife. I think that's nice.

388
00:26:08,821 --> 00:26:10,971
- How many teams are in this qualifier?
- Two.

389
00:26:11,061 --> 00:26:13,369
If we beat this team,
we're in the Vegas Open?

390
00:26:13,461 --> 00:26:15,258
- Yeah.
- That seems pretty simple.

391
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:20,131
- Who's the other team?
- I have it right here. Just a sec.

392
00:26:20,221 --> 00:26:24,691
- Troop 417.
- Christ. We're playing Boy Scouts?

393
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,494
Not quite.

394
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,293
Bollocks.

395
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,690
Troop 417, ready.

396
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,418
Average Joe's, ready.

397
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,732
Set. Dodgeball.

398
00:27:16,099 --> 00:27:18,408
I'm gonna send you to hell.

399
00:27:27,739 --> 00:27:32,767
- I'm really sorry. Are you all right?
- Why would you hit a girl? Why?

400
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,815
I am so sorry. Are you OK?

401
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:39,373
Winner - Troop 417.

402
00:27:39,459 --> 00:27:41,450
In your face.

403
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:45,737
You're adopted.
Your parents don't even love you.

404
00:27:48,018 --> 00:27:53,810
And now, without further ado,
it gives me great pleasure to award...

405
00:27:56,459 --> 00:27:59,530
I'm sorry.
We have a bit of a problem here.

406
00:28:00,258 --> 00:28:03,375
Unfortunately for Troop 417,

407
00:28:03,459 --> 00:28:07,292
during the ADAA-required
random drug screening,

408
00:28:07,378 --> 00:28:12,577
one of your player's urine tested positive
for three separate types of anabolic steroids,

409
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:16,412
and a low-grade beaver tranquilliser.

410
00:28:16,498 --> 00:28:20,457
I'm afraid, by rule,
your team must be disqualified.

411
00:28:21,018 --> 00:28:23,293
Goddamn you, Bernice.

412
00:28:23,978 --> 00:28:27,288
By the power vested in me,
I declare the winner of this year's

413
00:28:27,378 --> 00:28:32,611
Dodgeball Regional Qualifying Tournament
and Grammar Jamboree to be

414
00:28:32,698 --> 00:28:34,450
Average Joe's Gym.

415
00:28:37,178 --> 00:28:38,895
You lied.

416
00:28:45,537 --> 00:28:50,453
All I'm saying to you, Kate, is that you can
admit the real reason why you showed up.

417
00:28:50,537 --> 00:28:54,849
I was in the neighbourhood and
I thought you could use a cheering section.

418
00:28:54,937 --> 00:28:58,486
Kate, if you wannajoin the team,
all you have to do is ask.

419
00:28:58,577 --> 00:29:01,296
Thank you, Peter. I don't.

420
00:29:02,177 --> 00:29:04,850
It is obvious that you dig me.

421
00:29:04,937 --> 00:29:06,848
- You're hooked on La Fleur.
- God.

422
00:29:06,937 --> 00:29:11,727
I've been through this many times. I'm sorry.
You can't stay away from me. I'm so stupid.

423
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:17,686
I'll admit that, in spite of yourself, you have
brief moments where you're not completely...

424
00:29:19,297 --> 00:29:22,208
What? I'm not completely what?

425
00:29:22,297 --> 00:29:24,936
Pathetic.

426
00:29:25,536 --> 00:29:28,573
Hey, White. I didn't think
that Nazi camp got out until eight.

427
00:29:28,656 --> 00:29:33,013
- Did you decide to skip arts and crafts?
- Yes, I did.

428
00:29:33,096 --> 00:29:36,976
Hello, Kate.
I wasn't aware I was paying you to socialise.

429
00:29:37,056 --> 00:29:43,575
- You're not. I'm off the clock.
- Isn't it "convenient" for you, and the clock?

430
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:47,615
I dropped by to congratulate you
on your victory by disqualification

431
00:29:47,696 --> 00:29:51,530
and introduce you to the team that
will win the Las Vegas Dodgeball Open.

432
00:29:51,616 --> 00:29:53,288
My team.

433
00:29:54,496 --> 00:29:56,884
Allow me the pleasure of introducing you to

434
00:29:56,975 --> 00:29:58,966
Blade.

435
00:29:59,855 --> 00:30:01,846
Laser.

436
00:30:02,816 --> 00:30:05,010
Blazer.

437
00:30:05,096 --> 00:30:08,486
I've believe you've met
my fitness <i>consigliere,</i> Me'Shell.

438
00:30:08,576 --> 00:30:12,966
- We met.
- And I almost forgot our last player.

439
00:30:13,056 --> 00:30:17,811
Meet Fran Stalinofskivitchdavitovichski.

440
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:31,534
In her home country of Romanovia,
dodgeball is the national sport.

441
00:30:31,615 --> 00:30:35,893
Her nuclear power plant's team won
the championship five years running,

442
00:30:35,975 --> 00:30:40,969
which makes her the deadliest woman
on earth with a dodgeball.

443
00:30:41,055 --> 00:30:42,772
Ball me, Blazer.

444
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:45,484
Show them, Fran.

445
00:30:49,695 --> 00:30:52,333
That's just her change-up.

446
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:54,406
End of demo.

447
00:30:54,495 --> 00:30:57,292
We are the Globo Gym Purple Cobras

448
00:30:57,375 --> 00:31:00,969
and we will, we will rock you.

449
00:31:05,175 --> 00:31:07,927
I think that guy might really be dead.

450
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:13,653
Wait a minute. How can you be
entered in the Las Vegas Open?

451
00:31:13,734 --> 00:31:15,929
You didn't win a regional qualifying match.

452
00:31:16,014 --> 00:31:19,211
Oh, my God. We never even won
a regional qualifying match.

453
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,285
Yeah. Now I remember.

454
00:31:21,374 --> 00:31:24,923
The dodgeball chancellor's
an extremely personal friend of mine.

455
00:31:25,014 --> 00:31:28,165
I helped him shed some unwanted poundage
before beach season.

456
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:30,848
So close your rule book
on that one, Poindextor.

457
00:31:30,934 --> 00:31:35,325
White, we didn't come here to "rumble".
We came here to celebrate as a team.

458
00:31:35,413 --> 00:31:38,450
There's plenty of bar here
for you and the Globo-nauts.

459
00:31:38,534 --> 00:31:40,252
Team?

460
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:44,167
What team?
Your best player thinks he's a pirate.

461
00:31:47,414 --> 00:31:50,803
First of all, he is way more
of a pirate than you will ever be.

462
00:31:50,893 --> 00:31:56,013
Secondly, we don't know who our best player
is yet. We've only had one game.

463
00:31:56,093 --> 00:32:00,689
- It could be any one of us at this point.
- Go ahead, make yourjokes, Mr

464
00:32:00,773 --> 00:32:02,764
Jokey... Joke-maker.

465
00:32:02,853 --> 00:32:05,651
But let me hit you with
some knowledge. Quit now.

466
00:32:05,733 --> 00:32:10,807
Save yourself the embarrassment of losing
with these losers in Las Vegas, La Fleur.

467
00:32:10,893 --> 00:32:13,965
Alliteration aside,
I'll take my chances in the tournament.

468
00:32:14,053 --> 00:32:18,443
- Yeah, you will take your chances.
- I know. I just said that.

469
00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:21,570
- I know you did.
- I'm not sure where you're going with this.

470
00:32:21,652 --> 00:32:24,963
- I'm not sure where <i>you're</i> going with this.
- That's what I said.

471
00:32:25,052 --> 00:32:29,205
- That's what I'm saying to you.
- All right.

472
00:32:29,292 --> 00:32:30,772
Touché.

473
00:32:33,373 --> 00:32:36,250
We're gonna split,
but we'll see you at the tournament.

474
00:32:36,332 --> 00:32:41,122
And, La Fleur, best bring your bib
cos it's gonna get messy.

475
00:32:45,612 --> 00:32:47,682
Are you all right? You OK?

476
00:32:49,732 --> 00:32:51,882
Let's bounce. Cobras.

477
00:32:55,131 --> 00:33:00,968
OK, guys, let's just get ourselves cleaned up
and head on home, all right?

478
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:08,479
Hey, you.

479
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:13,167
That was the worst damn display
of dodgeball I've seen in 40 years.

480
00:33:13,252 --> 00:33:16,607
You want a dodgeball victory,
you've gotta grab it by its haunches

481
00:33:16,692 --> 00:33:19,968
and hump it into submission.
That's the only way.

482
00:33:20,051 --> 00:33:23,282
OK, crazy guy. I'm gonna go home now.

483
00:33:23,371 --> 00:33:26,329
I ain't crazy and I ain't a guy.

484
00:33:27,451 --> 00:33:30,284
The name's Patches O'Houlihan.

485
00:33:30,371 --> 00:33:32,931
I'm your new coach.

486
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,844
Patches O'Houlihan?
The guy from the dodgeball film?

487
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:38,650
- Yeah. He said he wants to coach us.
- You said yes?

488
00:33:38,731 --> 00:33:42,690
I figured the steady hand of a seasoned
dodgeball coach could only benefit us.

489
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:45,729
A'iight.
But he's not weird or anything, is he?

490
00:33:45,811 --> 00:33:48,609
No. No, he's totally normal.

491
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:02,487
I love the smell of queef in the morning.

492
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,561
I mean normal for us.

493
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:06,881
Line up, ladies.

494
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:09,245
- What does he mean, line up?
- Now.

495
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:15,879
If you're gonna learn to be
true dodgeballers,

496
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:19,645
then you've got to learn
the five Ds of dodgeball:

497
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:22,688
dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge.

498
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:28,561
If you master the five Ds,
no amount of balls on earth can hit you.

499
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:32,847
- Queer bait, go ahead.
- Me, or...

500
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:37,639
Yeah, shouldn't we learn by dodging balls
that are thrown at us, or...

501
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:40,961
That's what this sack of wrenches is for.

502
00:34:46,049 --> 00:34:48,610
If you can dodge a wrench,
you can dodge a ball.

503
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,680
What?

504
00:35:00,049 --> 00:35:01,801
Any other questions?

505
00:35:01,889 --> 00:35:04,005
My God.

506
00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:09,004
Yeah. Patches, are you sure
that this is completely necessary?

507
00:35:09,089 --> 00:35:11,444
Necessary?

508
00:35:11,529 --> 00:35:15,647
- Is it necessary for me to drink my urine?
- Probably not.

509
00:35:15,729 --> 00:35:20,564
No. But I do it anyway
because it's sterile and I like the taste.

510
00:35:20,649 --> 00:35:22,048
OK.

511
00:35:22,128 --> 00:35:27,408
If you're leading this squad, La Fleur, you've
got to learn to do the dance in the dark.

512
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:30,045
Here, put that on.

513
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:32,404
All right, ladies, buckle up.

514
00:35:32,729 --> 00:35:34,047
It's showtime.

515
00:35:36,729 --> 00:35:39,118
Dodge, duck, dip. Dive.

516
00:35:40,728 --> 00:35:42,286
Dodge.

517
00:35:42,368 --> 00:35:44,120
Dive.

518
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:47,325
Dip. Dive. Dodge.

519
00:35:48,008 --> 00:35:52,524
I've got three weeks to whip you
suck-ass failure junkies into shape.

520
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:56,078
Come on. I get better runs in my shorts.

521
00:35:56,688 --> 00:36:01,602
Catch a ball, one of their guys goes out.
One of our guys comes back in.

522
00:36:01,688 --> 00:36:04,805
That's the way you hurt 'em.
That's the way you win.

523
00:36:07,368 --> 00:36:09,245
Let's go. A little hustle here.

524
00:36:16,127 --> 00:36:17,800
That's really good, Peter.

525
00:36:21,367 --> 00:36:25,485
Come on. Only 19 miles to go.

526
00:36:29,088 --> 00:36:30,282
Attaboy.

527
00:36:32,047 --> 00:36:34,004
Next man.

528
00:36:34,087 --> 00:36:37,124
Good luck to you, Gordon.
Remember it's 90% mental.

529
00:36:37,207 --> 00:36:38,197
Okey-dokey.

530
00:36:38,287 --> 00:36:42,360
If you can dodge traffic,
you can dodge a ball.

531
00:36:45,847 --> 00:36:47,803
You got it, Gord.

532
00:36:52,407 --> 00:36:55,444
- I'm fine. I'm OK.
- OK, there.

533
00:37:02,007 --> 00:37:04,043
- Man.
- Wake up, Smithy.

534
00:37:09,606 --> 00:37:13,884
Hell, son. You're about as useful
as a cock-flavoured lollipop.

535
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,876
Quick feet, fast hands.

536
00:37:16,967 --> 00:37:18,844
Catch it and throw.

537
00:37:19,486 --> 00:37:24,162
Pick up the pace. What a bunch of females.

538
00:37:27,606 --> 00:37:30,484
Jesus. Gimme that.

539
00:37:31,686 --> 00:37:34,723
You couldn't hit water
if you fell out of a boat.

540
00:37:34,806 --> 00:37:37,639
Where's your killer instinct?
You gotta get angry.

541
00:37:37,726 --> 00:37:41,275
You gotta get mean.
That's the only way you can play.

542
00:37:41,966 --> 00:37:44,559
I guess I'm not really an angry person.

543
00:37:48,686 --> 00:37:51,246
Are you angry now?

544
00:37:51,325 --> 00:37:56,080
- Breathe it out.
- Come on, let's get going here.

545
00:38:03,285 --> 00:38:05,162
Little help?

546
00:38:13,845 --> 00:38:16,678
What? Eight years of softball.

547
00:38:16,765 --> 00:38:20,394
- Man, she gotta be a lesbian.
- She is not a lesbian.

548
00:38:20,485 --> 00:38:23,079
All I know is that dyke can play.

549
00:38:34,205 --> 00:38:36,274
Come on, come on.

550
00:38:36,365 --> 00:38:38,832
- Please.
- We need you. You're really good.

551
00:38:38,924 --> 00:38:40,836
Owen'll be team manager if you play.

552
00:38:40,925 --> 00:38:42,482
- I will?
- Shut up.

553
00:38:42,565 --> 00:38:45,397
Look, I find White Goodman creepy,
just like you do...

554
00:38:45,484 --> 00:38:47,794
All the more reason for you to join us.

555
00:38:47,885 --> 00:38:51,035
Come on, Kate.
Time to put your mouth where our balls are.

556
00:38:51,124 --> 00:38:55,242
Sorry, I can't. I'm under contract.
It'd be a conflict of interest.

557
00:38:55,724 --> 00:38:57,840
Suit yourself.

558
00:38:57,924 --> 00:39:01,519
All right, you heard Billie-Jean King.
No crying in the breast milk.

559
00:39:01,604 --> 00:39:03,799
We got plenty of work to do. Let's go.

560
00:39:07,404 --> 00:39:10,998
We punch the pizza dough down,
and it's time to sauce it up.

561
00:39:11,084 --> 00:39:13,075
Boy, is my mouth watering.

562
00:39:13,164 --> 00:39:16,474
You want to put a big dollop
of that tangy red on the dough,

563
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:19,397
then use the cheese to shove it to the edge.

564
00:39:19,484 --> 00:39:21,440
Sir, I need you to take a look at...

565
00:39:21,524 --> 00:39:23,401
No. What...

566
00:39:23,483 --> 00:39:28,035
What...
What have I said about knocking?

567
00:39:28,163 --> 00:39:30,393
- Always knock.
- Sorry, sir.

568
00:39:30,483 --> 00:39:35,716
What is so important that you need to
interrupt me in my private reflection period?

569
00:39:36,243 --> 00:39:38,234
These.

570
00:39:42,123 --> 00:39:46,560
- They're getting better.
- Yes. I can see that, Me'Shell.

571
00:39:46,643 --> 00:39:50,921
I'm through playing games. It's time
to end this square dance once and for all.

572
00:39:51,003 --> 00:39:53,072
What about the girl? She can throw.

573
00:39:53,163 --> 00:39:57,042
I'll simply have to woo Kate
a bit sooner than nature intended.

574
00:39:57,123 --> 00:39:59,876
But rest assured, Me'Shell.

575
00:39:59,962 --> 00:40:05,275
There's no resisting when
White Goodman puts on his shiny shoes.

576
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:27,438
- Who is it?
- It's White.

577
00:40:29,962 --> 00:40:32,795
- Surprise.
- White.

578
00:40:34,122 --> 00:40:37,000
What... What are you doing here?

579
00:40:37,082 --> 00:40:39,312
How do you know where I live?

580
00:40:39,402 --> 00:40:41,597
It's called the Freedom of Information Act.

581
00:40:41,681 --> 00:40:45,231
The hippies finally got something right.
Just kiddin'. Not really.

582
00:40:45,322 --> 00:40:48,997
Hey. I got some great news. Sit down.

583
00:40:51,762 --> 00:40:53,753
- What is it?
- You're fired.

584
00:40:53,841 --> 00:40:55,479
- I'm what?
- You're fired.

585
00:40:55,562 --> 00:40:59,237
I told the bank that you were stealing
and drinking on the job. They bought it.

586
00:40:59,321 --> 00:41:02,472
They signed some other
pencil pusher to my account.

587
00:41:02,562 --> 00:41:04,711
Why would you do that?

588
00:41:05,241 --> 00:41:07,835
I'm here to begin my courtship of you, Kate.

589
00:41:07,921 --> 00:41:10,833
- You fired me so I'd date you?
- Yuh-huh.

590
00:41:10,922 --> 00:41:13,674
You are a crazy little man.

591
00:41:13,761 --> 00:41:16,356
I know you've been hiding
some feelings for me.

592
00:41:16,441 --> 00:41:18,477
Yeah. Nausea.

593
00:41:18,561 --> 00:41:21,837
If you don't leave in two seconds,
you'll know how that feels.

594
00:41:23,561 --> 00:41:26,280
You like the freaky stuff, huh?
That's cool.

595
00:41:27,161 --> 00:41:28,957
I can be naughty, too.

596
00:41:30,561 --> 00:41:32,950
Real, freakin' naughty.

597
00:41:34,441 --> 00:41:36,397
- You a naughty freak?
- Need help leaving?

598
00:41:38,401 --> 00:41:40,073
This doesn't concern you, La Fleur.

599
00:41:40,161 --> 00:41:43,392
Not nearly as much as your hair does.
That's for sure.

600
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:47,109
But I believe she asked you to leave.

601
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,516
I get it. You caught the scent
of a lesser stag in your nostrils.

602
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,991
Pity. I'll let you have
your little moment, La Fleur,

603
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:05,156
cos after this tournament, your gym,
your life and your gal are gonna be mine.

604
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,310
All mine.

605
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,871
To be continued...

606
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,633
You don't get to touch me, ever.

607
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,075
OK, Romeo. Let me help you up.

608
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,630
Get off me.
Don't you touch me.

609
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,552
It is over between us, Kate.

610
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,552
Nobody makes me bleed my own blood.
Nobody.

611
00:42:40,279 --> 00:42:43,510
- At least that wasn't weird.
- Yeah.

612
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,477
- Do I smell cookies?
- Hey.

613
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:50,188
Dear Barbara.

614
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:59,036
I like unicorns.

615
00:43:01,639 --> 00:43:03,709
I know you said no to joining the team,

616
00:43:03,799 --> 00:43:07,552
but I'd like you to reconsider
as a personal favour to me.

617
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:09,277
- Peter...
- Before you answer,

618
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:11,827
you should know you'd have
your own changing room.

619
00:43:11,919 --> 00:43:14,035
- Really?
- Sort of.

620
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:17,393
And there's also this.

621
00:43:18,238 --> 00:43:20,309
- OK, what's this?
- I overdid.

622
00:43:22,678 --> 00:43:26,193
Look at you. Two expired movie passes

623
00:43:26,279 --> 00:43:30,636
and a coupon for one free back rub
from Peter La Fleur.

624
00:43:30,718 --> 00:43:35,234
- Play your cards right, could be a full body.
- Will you just stop, please?

625
00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:39,197
I don't want your perk package.
I don't want your back rub.

626
00:43:39,278 --> 00:43:42,827
I just want to see White Goodman's face
when we win that tournament.

627
00:43:42,918 --> 00:43:45,193
- You're in?
- I'm in.

628
00:43:49,198 --> 00:43:53,987
Las Vegas. A city built of hot sand,
broken dreams and $5 lobster.

629
00:43:54,077 --> 00:43:57,673
A city where you can get a happy ending,
if you pay a little extra.

630
00:43:57,757 --> 00:44:00,909
A city home to a sporting event
greater than the World Cup,

631
00:44:00,998 --> 00:44:05,310
World Series and World War II combined.

632
00:44:05,398 --> 00:44:09,515
Live from Las Vegas, it's the Las Vegas
International Dodgeball Open

633
00:44:09,597 --> 00:44:12,316
here on ESPN8 - the "Ocho" -

634
00:44:12,397 --> 00:44:16,994
bringing you the finest in seldom-seen sports
from around the globe since 1999.

635
00:44:17,077 --> 00:44:20,308
If it's almost a sport, we've got it here.

636
00:44:20,397 --> 00:44:25,994
Hello, everybody, and welcome to this year's
Las Vegas International Dodgeball Open

637
00:44:26,077 --> 00:44:29,228
brought to you exclusively
here on ESPN8 - the "Ocho".

638
00:44:29,317 --> 00:44:32,912
We're coming to you live from
the Las Vegas University Learning Annex.

639
00:44:32,997 --> 00:44:34,793
My name is Cotton McKnight

640
00:44:34,877 --> 00:44:38,585
and with me, as always,
is my partner in crime, Pepper Brooks.

641
00:44:38,677 --> 00:44:40,474
Yeah. Cotton, hey.

642
00:44:40,556 --> 00:44:45,790
Everybody, 32 teams in play, that means
four wins is gonna get you in the final match,

643
00:44:45,876 --> 00:44:49,187
the fifth win getting you
the 50K that everyone's chasing.

644
00:44:49,277 --> 00:44:50,266
Cotton.

645
00:44:50,357 --> 00:44:55,476
There's an electricity in the air,
a palpable hue of anticipation.

646
00:44:55,557 --> 00:44:58,912
Immortality - five simple victories away.

647
00:44:58,997 --> 00:45:03,672
They've come from all over - Kathmandu
to Timbuktu, and all points in-between -

648
00:45:03,756 --> 00:45:08,034
to compete in the one
true human test - dodgeball.

649
00:45:08,836 --> 00:45:11,350
A reminder.
All players must be vaccinated

650
00:45:11,436 --> 00:45:15,588
for cholera, syphilis and shingles
before play begins.

651
00:45:15,676 --> 00:45:19,908
Again, dyslexic players
will not be allowed on the court.

652
00:45:19,996 --> 00:45:24,274
Team Blitzkrieg to the tournament floor
for a first-round match.

653
00:45:24,356 --> 00:45:27,587
Only ADAA balls will be used.

654
00:45:27,676 --> 00:45:31,351
Personal balls of any kind
are strictly prohibited.

655
00:45:31,435 --> 00:45:33,824
- Hey.
- Hey. What's in the box?

656
00:45:33,915 --> 00:45:38,307
Guys, I figured a real dodgeball team
needs real dodgeball uniforms.

657
00:45:38,395 --> 00:45:42,105
So I threw out those old ratty ones
and designed these myself.

658
00:45:42,196 --> 00:45:46,393
All right. Now we got our thing going on,
maybe we'll start smacking each other.

659
00:45:46,475 --> 00:45:48,466
I hope everything fits.

660
00:45:50,435 --> 00:45:52,949
- Wait.
- Nice.

661
00:45:53,035 --> 00:45:57,392
This isn't right.
This isn't what I ordered.

662
00:46:01,115 --> 00:46:04,744
- What's this?
- What the hell is that? This is screwed up.

663
00:46:05,675 --> 00:46:08,508
- What are we supposed to do now?
- Don't worry.

664
00:46:08,595 --> 00:46:10,711
- We'll play in what we've got on.
- We can't.

665
00:46:10,794 --> 00:46:13,468
ADAA rules require we wear
matching uniforms.

666
00:46:13,554 --> 00:46:17,594
I don't think they require ass-less chaps, OK?

667
00:46:17,674 --> 00:46:22,668
Everybody, calm down. We've got plenty
of time to find other uniforms before we play.

668
00:46:22,754 --> 00:46:26,110
Ladies, we gotta get on the court
or we're gonna forfeit the game.

669
00:46:26,194 --> 00:46:29,903
Come on, let's go.
Let's see some movement. Chop-chop.

670
00:46:29,994 --> 00:46:31,951
I don't see any movement. Let's go.

671
00:46:42,074 --> 00:46:44,827
How about those dodgeball dancers, folks?

672
00:46:44,914 --> 00:46:48,668
- That is some good, clean, family fun, Cot.
- Right you are.

673
00:46:48,754 --> 00:46:51,108
Here comes Germany's Team Blitzkrieg.

674
00:46:51,194 --> 00:46:54,470
The reigning European champ
hopes to extend their empire here.

675
00:46:54,553 --> 00:46:56,544
Appeasement be damned.

676
00:46:56,633 --> 00:46:59,831
Here comes
the relatively unknown challengers,

677
00:46:59,913 --> 00:47:03,986
a regional qualifying team,
Average Joe's Gymnasium.

678
00:47:13,394 --> 00:47:15,543
My sweet Jesus.

679
00:47:16,473 --> 00:47:18,430
That's rad.

680
00:47:18,513 --> 00:47:21,232
Hey, asshole, you guys suck.

681
00:47:21,673 --> 00:47:24,107
Thank you. Nice to be in Vegas.

682
00:47:24,193 --> 00:47:26,787
Hi. We're all here and

683
00:47:26,873 --> 00:47:28,704
we are ready to play.

684
00:47:31,433 --> 00:47:33,867
- OK.
- OK.

685
00:47:35,633 --> 00:47:39,671
We get our first glimpse of the Average Joe's
squad, sporting unwieldy uniforms.

686
00:47:39,753 --> 00:47:42,472
I feel like I'm watching a Cher video.

687
00:47:42,552 --> 00:47:44,464
Average Joe's, ready.

688
00:47:44,553 --> 00:47:46,430
Blitzkrieg, ready.

689
00:47:46,512 --> 00:47:47,865
Dodgeball.

690
00:47:47,953 --> 00:47:52,583
And we're under way. Average Joe's
versus the heavily favoured German team.

691
00:47:52,672 --> 00:47:56,347
Of course, S&M gear first made
popular by the lyric poet, Sappho,

692
00:47:56,432 --> 00:47:59,344
- from the island of Lesbos.
- Clean hit. You're out.

693
00:47:59,432 --> 00:48:04,028
Leather and latex belong in the bedroom,
not on the dodgeball court.

694
00:48:04,112 --> 00:48:09,345
Where's that training?
Dodge, duck, dip, dive, dodge.

695
00:48:09,832 --> 00:48:14,189
Captain Peter La Fleur gets eliminated
and coach O'Houlihan is not happy.

696
00:48:21,192 --> 00:48:23,752
This Average Joe's team
doesn't look up to snuff.

697
00:48:24,951 --> 00:48:28,262
Midline infraction.
You went over the line, you're out.

698
00:48:28,351 --> 00:48:30,707
The Average Joe's catches a break there.

699
00:48:30,792 --> 00:48:34,227
The Germans still dominating
this Maginot Line-like defence.

700
00:48:34,312 --> 00:48:36,779
Good toss by the submissive out there.

701
00:48:36,871 --> 00:48:40,865
Just two players left for Joe...
Check that. Make it one.

702
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:43,750
Looks like Average Joe's
might be heading home early.

703
00:48:44,192 --> 00:48:47,945
It's all up to the only player
without a Y-chromosome, Kate Veatch.

704
00:48:49,071 --> 00:48:51,062
What a throw.

705
00:48:51,151 --> 00:48:53,188
Hold your phone, she's got a cannon.

706
00:48:53,271 --> 00:48:54,863
Yes.

707
00:48:54,951 --> 00:48:59,024
- Come on, Kate.
- You're the only man out there. Give it to 'em.

708
00:48:59,111 --> 00:49:04,185
Germans have a two-one advantage.
Great catch. La Fleur's back in the game.

709
00:49:04,271 --> 00:49:08,662
How about that? A two-on-one switcheroo.
Now Joe's has the upper hand.

710
00:49:08,751 --> 00:49:10,628
- Great deflection.
- Take it to him.

711
00:49:10,711 --> 00:49:15,262
- He's ball-less now.
- He doesn't have any balls, Cotton.

712
00:49:15,351 --> 00:49:18,148
Winner. Average Joe's.

713
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:21,899
My sweet dick, it's magic.

714
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:23,219
Hey, all right.

715
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:28,749
My. The Germans losing in the first round
and Average Joe's wins in a shocking upset.

716
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:31,470
I feel shocked.

717
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:41,786
Losers.

718
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:55,468
You must be Daddy.

719
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:59,982
Average Joe's has shocked the dodgeball
pundits and made it to tomorrow's round

720
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:03,618
where we'll separate the wheat from the chaff,
the men from the boys,

721
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:06,747
and the awkwardly feminine
from the possibly Canadian.

722
00:50:06,829 --> 00:50:09,946
Don't go anywhere, folks.
It's just getting exciting.

723
00:50:14,189 --> 00:50:17,660
- What the hell.
- That guy's a dickhead.

724
00:50:23,069 --> 00:50:25,537
You wanted to see me, Patches?

725
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:30,298
You did good out there, real good.
You're a natural leader, La Fleur.

726
00:50:30,389 --> 00:50:33,381
Those men and that muff-diver believe in you.

727
00:50:33,469 --> 00:50:35,858
Kate's not a muff-diver.

728
00:50:37,589 --> 00:50:39,580
Hey. That's for you.

729
00:50:40,909 --> 00:50:44,026
- I can't accept this.
- You're a hell of a player, Peter.

730
00:50:44,109 --> 00:50:46,418
You earned it.

731
00:50:46,509 --> 00:50:51,218
I've got some hookers in my room.
What do you say we go celebrate? My treat.

732
00:50:51,309 --> 00:50:54,426
No, thanks, I'll just stick
with the scarf, but thank you.

733
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,500
Suit yourself, queer.

734
00:51:06,348 --> 00:51:08,100
- Sorry.
- Justin?

735
00:51:08,188 --> 00:51:10,782
Amber.
Jeez Louise, what are you doing here?

736
00:51:10,868 --> 00:51:15,817
- The National Cheerleading Championships.
- Oh, yeah, the NCCs. That's so awesome.

737
00:51:15,908 --> 00:51:19,662
- We're in the finals tomorrow. And you?
- I'm in the dodgeball tournament.

738
00:51:19,748 --> 00:51:24,299
These are my team-mates,
Dwight, Ms Veatch and Gordon.

739
00:51:24,388 --> 00:51:26,583
This is Amber.

740
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:28,738
Come on, I wanna ride the roller coaster.

741
00:51:28,828 --> 00:51:33,538
- Hey, Derek. Sweet 'do, man.
- Get bent, helmet. Let's go, Amber.

742
00:51:33,627 --> 00:51:39,021
- It was nice to see you. Good luck tomorrow.
- And also you. You look healthy... good.

743
00:51:39,868 --> 00:51:41,347
What?

744
00:51:41,427 --> 00:51:44,305
Don't worry about that guy, Justin.
He's a total jerk.

745
00:51:44,388 --> 00:51:47,697
He'll probably fall off the roller coaster
and break every bone.

746
00:51:47,787 --> 00:51:50,347
- Nice, Dwight.
- I'm just saying, it happens.

747
00:51:50,428 --> 00:51:52,895
My cousin Ray-Ray. Boop. Dead.

748
00:51:52,987 --> 00:51:54,136
Thanks, man.

749
00:51:58,507 --> 00:52:01,385
Let's huddle up here.
We've got some work to do.

750
00:52:01,467 --> 00:52:03,583
We got lucky in the first round.

751
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:07,137
We caught those dirty Krauts napping,
but that won't happen again,

752
00:52:07,227 --> 00:52:11,220
so blow out the horse hockey
and remember what I taught you.

753
00:52:11,307 --> 00:52:17,496
Blockers in the centre, funnelling, aim low
and will someone catch a goddamned ball?

754
00:52:17,587 --> 00:52:22,103
It's like watching a bunch of retards
trying to fuck a doorknob out there.

755
00:52:22,186 --> 00:52:25,975
Get it together.
Let's play some dodgeball.

756
00:52:26,067 --> 00:52:27,897
Hands in.

757
00:52:27,987 --> 00:52:29,978
One, two, three, Joe's.

758
00:52:31,587 --> 00:52:33,736
- Average Joe's ready?
- Yes.

759
00:52:33,826 --> 00:52:35,897
Lumberjacks, ready?

760
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:36,976
Dodgeball.

761
00:52:37,066 --> 00:52:40,502
Average Joe's has a tough job,
facing the Lumberjacks.

762
00:52:40,586 --> 00:52:44,022
These woodsmen probably haven't
even smelt a woman in eight months.

763
00:52:44,106 --> 00:52:46,825
They must masturbate a lot, Cotton.

764
00:52:46,907 --> 00:52:49,500
- Clean hit. You're out.
- In the deer gut.

765
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:52,464
- Average Joe's looking tough.
- Yes.

766
00:52:57,305 --> 00:52:59,866
There's a souvenir for a lucky fan.

767
00:53:02,026 --> 00:53:06,656
Timber. Peter La Fleur nails him.
That's all she wrote, folks.

768
00:53:06,745 --> 00:53:10,818
Average Joe's does some clear-cutting of
their own and moves onto the quarterfinal.

769
00:53:12,866 --> 00:53:15,585
Globo Gym hoping to drop an A-bomb
on the Kamikazes.

770
00:53:15,665 --> 00:53:19,101
I don't know how they can play
in diapers, Cotton. I never could.

771
00:53:19,185 --> 00:53:20,505
Peekaboo.

772
00:53:20,745 --> 00:53:23,657
White Goodman, employing
his patented peekaboo-style attack,

773
00:53:23,745 --> 00:53:27,055
tells Suzuki Toyota Oshinawa this is my dojo.

774
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:31,698
Is he gonna feel it tomorrow?
Right in his beak.

775
00:53:31,785 --> 00:53:36,540
A relentless Globo Gym attack led by
their Lilliputian leader, White Goodman.

776
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:39,583
It's gotta be the hair. It's beautiful.

777
00:53:39,665 --> 00:53:43,943
Feathered and lethal.
You just don't see it nowadays.

778
00:53:45,105 --> 00:53:50,862
Globo Gym says, <i>"Domo arigato,</i> Mr Roboto",
and breezes into the semifinals.

779
00:53:53,025 --> 00:53:56,540
Skillz That Killz, ready?
Average Joe's, ready? Dodgeball.

780
00:53:56,625 --> 00:53:59,900
Average Joe's planning
to playa hate Skillz That Killz,

781
00:53:59,984 --> 00:54:02,294
the inner-city champs for five years straight.

782
00:54:02,385 --> 00:54:06,900
Skillz might be looking past Average Joe's,
doing more dancing than dodgeballing.

783
00:54:06,984 --> 00:54:10,421
They better check themselves
before they wreck themselves.

784
00:54:10,504 --> 00:54:15,498
Right you are, partner.
Great catch. La Fleur wheels and fires.

785
00:54:16,304 --> 00:54:18,898
Winner. Average Joe's.

786
00:54:18,984 --> 00:54:23,694
And Average Joe's, not blinded by the
bling-bling, advances to the semifinal.

787
00:54:26,104 --> 00:54:30,540
Globo Gym's making mincemeat
of the Las Vegas Police Department.

788
00:54:30,624 --> 00:54:32,295
That's gotta hurt.

789
00:54:34,344 --> 00:54:36,175
B-b-b-bull's-eye.

790
00:54:36,264 --> 00:54:38,494
Winner. Globo Gym.

791
00:54:38,584 --> 00:54:43,453
Sportsmanship be darned.
Globo Gym hands the Las Vegas Police a 187,

792
00:54:43,544 --> 00:54:46,012
and they're going to the finals.

793
00:54:48,424 --> 00:54:52,542
The Poughkeepsie State Flying Cougars
are all over Average Joe's today.

794
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:57,777
Itjust doesn't look good for 'em. The winner
of this match faces Globo Gym in the finals.

795
00:54:57,863 --> 00:54:59,854
Right in the testicles.

796
00:54:59,944 --> 00:55:02,377
Ouch-Town. Population: you, bro.

797
00:55:02,463 --> 00:55:05,500
Average Joe's down to their final two players.

798
00:55:06,743 --> 00:55:08,893
La Fleur can't hold on.
He's gotta sit down.

799
00:55:08,983 --> 00:55:11,861
- Time out. Gordy.
- Time out. Time out.

800
00:55:12,463 --> 00:55:13,816
Time. Time is out.

801
00:55:13,902 --> 00:55:17,737
It looks like the clock is about to
strike midnight on this Cinderella story,

802
00:55:17,823 --> 00:55:20,417
turning Average Joe's
into the proverbial pumpkin.

803
00:55:20,503 --> 00:55:22,892
I sure do like pumpkins, Cotton.

804
00:55:24,263 --> 00:55:27,652
You won't hit 'em. They're too good,
and you suck somethin' awful.

805
00:55:27,742 --> 00:55:31,257
- Yes, sir. I do.
- Our only shot is for you to get angry.

806
00:55:31,343 --> 00:55:34,891
- Roger that. OK.
- All right. Hands in.

807
00:55:34,982 --> 00:55:37,291
- One, two, three.
- Joe's.

808
00:55:38,102 --> 00:55:41,061
You gotta get angry. Get angry now.

809
00:55:41,142 --> 00:55:45,694
Gordon Pibb, alone, facing five Cougars.
It's all over but the crying.

810
00:55:45,782 --> 00:55:49,172
Sayonara, <i>auf Wiedersehen</i> and goodbye.

811
00:56:01,901 --> 00:56:05,212
- Dodgeball.
- Let the dodgeball slaughter begin.

812
00:56:05,302 --> 00:56:07,133
Good deflection there.

813
00:56:07,222 --> 00:56:09,371
Hang on. And another one.

814
00:56:09,462 --> 00:56:11,929
Three balls at once. Who knew?

815
00:56:12,421 --> 00:56:14,855
Four on one.
Pibb won't go down without a fight.

816
00:56:14,941 --> 00:56:17,251
That's it.

817
00:56:17,342 --> 00:56:20,333
- You're kidding me.
- He's callin' 'em out.

818
00:56:21,142 --> 00:56:23,133
Now it's two on one. Who'd have thunk it?

819
00:56:23,222 --> 00:56:27,932
- Go, you crazy son of a bitch. Go.
- He's on the warpath.

820
00:56:29,981 --> 00:56:32,495
Incredible. It's one on one.

821
00:56:32,581 --> 00:56:36,256
- I can't believe it.
- It's just not believable, Cotton.

822
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:45,090
Winner.

823
00:56:45,421 --> 00:56:48,493
Average Joe's wins.

824
00:56:48,581 --> 00:56:53,450
They are going to the finals
to play Globo Gym for $50,000.

825
00:56:53,541 --> 00:56:57,250
- That'll buy one heck of a pumpkin.
- Right you are, Pep.

826
00:56:57,341 --> 00:56:59,730
I never would have dreamed it possible.

827
00:56:59,821 --> 00:57:04,257
But with seven-time ADAA All-Star
Patches O'Houlihan at the helm,

828
00:57:04,341 --> 00:57:07,060
I guess it must be the luck of the Irish.

829
00:57:10,941 --> 00:57:14,854
Tomorrow we're gonna pecker-slap
those Globo Gym bastards.

830
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:15,690
Yeah.

831
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:20,137
- You really think we can beat Globo Gym?
- As long as we got Patches, we got a shot.

832
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,054
My God.

833
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:32,774
Well, it's probably the way
he would have wanted to go.

834
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:36,136
- What?
- What are we gonna do without Patches?

835
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:38,290
We're gonna get our taints handed to us.

836
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:41,338
- What's a taint?
- I dunno. Sounds bad.

837
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,650
Maybe you should
go say something to the guys.

838
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:46,855
Yeah.

839
00:57:46,939 --> 00:57:53,287
They don't make a "sorry your coach just got
crushed by two tons of irony" Hallmark card.

840
00:57:54,779 --> 00:57:57,247
I'll be right back.

841
00:58:07,499 --> 00:58:08,978
What?

842
00:58:09,059 --> 00:58:14,053
We're opening a new Globo Gym in Mexico
City. I've been boning up on my Spanish.

843
00:58:16,139 --> 00:58:19,449
Me'Shell was having some digestive
problems. I hope you don't mind.

844
00:58:19,539 --> 00:58:21,734
Will you shut that?

845
00:58:21,819 --> 00:58:24,378
For all of us, baby.

846
00:58:26,939 --> 00:58:32,536
So that's the deal. I give you $100,000,
you sign over the deed to your gym.

847
00:58:32,618 --> 00:58:34,291
Period.

848
00:58:34,378 --> 00:58:36,449
End o'story.

849
00:58:36,539 --> 00:58:41,658
You really think you can come here and buy
me out, you're a lot dumber than I thought.

850
00:58:41,738 --> 00:58:47,132
Oh, I don't think I'm a lot dumber than you
thought I'd think that I thought I was once.

851
00:58:47,218 --> 00:58:50,291
Look, Peter, I know what it's like.

852
00:58:50,378 --> 00:58:54,815
Really. For all our blustery back-and-forth,
we're really pretty much the same guy.

853
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:58,447
We're both leaders. And I like
what you've done with the gym over there.

854
00:58:58,538 --> 00:59:03,248
I love the whole "I'm not OK, you're not OK,
but that's OK" thing you got going.

855
00:59:03,338 --> 00:59:06,535
"You can be fat as long as
you're happy inside." It works.

856
00:59:06,618 --> 00:59:09,928
And they love you. Whoo, do they love you.

857
00:59:10,018 --> 00:59:11,928
You're their Fonzie, Pete.

858
00:59:12,018 --> 00:59:14,213
"Hey." Right?

859
00:59:16,217 --> 00:59:21,575
But do you really think it's fair for them
to put all that pressure on you? All the time?

860
00:59:22,497 --> 00:59:25,695
Looking to you to solve their every problem?

861
00:59:25,777 --> 00:59:27,335
I mean, come on.

862
00:59:27,417 --> 00:59:31,410
I know you. You know you.

863
00:59:31,498 --> 00:59:34,409
And I know you know that I know you.

864
00:59:34,498 --> 00:59:36,887
You're heading for a fall, Pete.

865
00:59:36,977 --> 00:59:40,333
Sooner or later, Average Joe's is gonna close.

866
00:59:40,417 --> 00:59:44,410
And when it does, they're gonna blame you.

867
00:59:45,937 --> 00:59:49,771
I don't know if you've ever seen $100,000,
except maybe in the movies.

868
00:59:49,857 --> 00:59:53,611
But I assure you,
something gets lost in the translation.

869
00:59:56,497 --> 01:00:00,456
Money. $100,000. Dodgeball game.

870
01:00:02,176 --> 01:00:03,929
Take the money.

871
01:00:04,616 --> 01:00:09,292
Invest it in something.
Give it to charity, I don't care.

872
01:00:15,896 --> 01:00:17,966
Just sign the contract.

873
01:00:23,177 --> 01:00:26,054
Come on, guys. We got Peter.

874
01:00:26,136 --> 01:00:30,129
And they got guys named Laser and Blazer
and Taser, and all kinds of asers.

875
01:00:30,216 --> 01:00:33,606
Gar. Steve's gotta go drain the sea monster.

876
01:00:34,696 --> 01:00:36,766
Here. Justin, your virgin daiquiri.

877
01:00:36,856 --> 01:00:39,324
- Thanks, Ms Veatch.
- Nothing for me.

878
01:00:39,416 --> 01:00:43,489
- Dwight says we'll get killed out there, Peter.
- Let's not talk about tomorrow.

879
01:00:43,575 --> 01:00:46,932
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know. It's a little complicated.

880
01:00:47,015 --> 01:00:50,053
- But what do you think we should do?
- Yeah. Come on, tell us.

881
01:00:50,135 --> 01:00:51,329
What's the plan?

882
01:00:51,415 --> 01:00:54,532
What do you guys want from me?
I don't have a plan for you.

883
01:00:54,616 --> 01:00:58,654
We're gonna play Globo Gym tomorrow
and we're probably gonna lose.

884
01:00:58,736 --> 01:01:04,174
It's the truth. The sooner you guys get that
through your head, the easier this will all be.

885
01:01:05,535 --> 01:01:08,003
Jesus Christ.

886
01:01:08,455 --> 01:01:10,525
He didn't mean that.

887
01:01:10,615 --> 01:01:14,688
- Is he being serious?
- He's probably just stressed out.

888
01:01:14,775 --> 01:01:17,528
I've never seen him like that.

889
01:01:19,535 --> 01:01:23,210
Gar, matey, where are you headed? Peter...

890
01:01:23,295 --> 01:01:25,763
You are not a pirate.

891
01:01:33,135 --> 01:01:37,606
OK, guys. Let's get out of here
and get some rest for tomorrow, right?

892
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:46,731
Dwight...

893
01:01:46,814 --> 01:01:51,649
I'm gonna catch up with you guys later.
I'm gonna have a bathroom... go to the drink...

894
01:01:51,734 --> 01:01:53,452
in the bathroom.

895
01:01:53,534 --> 01:01:56,048
Whatever you do, wash your hands.

896
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:08,574
Excuse me, miss. I was wondering if...

897
01:02:08,654 --> 01:02:11,088
You are the one who stares at me.

898
01:02:11,174 --> 01:02:13,449
Why is this?

899
01:02:13,534 --> 01:02:17,971
Because I think you're
the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

900
01:02:24,093 --> 01:02:26,403
Watch it, freak.

901
01:02:38,613 --> 01:02:40,922
Go back to Treasure Island.

902
01:02:41,014 --> 01:02:43,368
Fag.

903
01:02:43,453 --> 01:02:45,444
Screw you.

904
01:02:57,253 --> 01:03:00,962
Katie, bar the door.
It's time for the championship match

905
01:03:01,053 --> 01:03:03,362
here on ESPN8 - the "Ocho".

906
01:03:03,452 --> 01:03:07,332
We've seen it all here, folks.
Grit, determination, incontinence.

907
01:03:07,412 --> 01:03:09,881
And it's all come down to this -
a Cinderella story.

908
01:03:09,973 --> 01:03:14,568
Average Joe's Gymnasium hopes to
drive their vorpal blade snicker-snack

909
01:03:14,653 --> 01:03:18,531
into the heart of the dodgeball Jabberwocky
that is the Globo Gym Purple Cobras,

910
01:03:18,613 --> 01:03:22,287
and walk away with $50,000
in stone-cold cash.

911
01:03:22,372 --> 01:03:26,331
Hello, everybody, and welcome
to what you've all been waiting for.

912
01:03:26,413 --> 01:03:30,087
A David-and-Goliath story
truer than the Bible itself.

913
01:03:30,172 --> 01:03:34,131
The championship dodgeball match
here on ESPN8 - the "Ocho".

914
01:03:36,732 --> 01:03:38,370
Peter?

915
01:03:40,612 --> 01:03:42,170
Peter?

916
01:03:42,252 --> 01:03:44,720
Hello?

917
01:03:44,812 --> 01:03:46,085
Peter?

918
01:03:46,172 --> 01:03:48,891
Come on, everybody headed down...

919
01:03:58,011 --> 01:03:59,843
So what happens on a double fault?

920
01:03:59,931 --> 01:04:05,085
On a double fault you go to sudden-death
elimination. It's Continuation Rule 113-D.

921
01:04:05,171 --> 01:04:07,811
- Whatever.
- Hey, guys, wait up.

922
01:04:11,651 --> 01:04:13,004
Justin.

923
01:04:13,091 --> 01:04:17,084
- I've been looking for you everywhere.
- Really? I mean, why? What's up?

924
01:04:17,171 --> 01:04:21,164
Derek fell off the roller coaster
and broke every bone in his body.

925
01:04:21,251 --> 01:04:22,650
My God, that's awful.

926
01:04:22,731 --> 01:04:26,167
We were the centre Kewpie. With no
centre Kewpie we can't do our routine.

927
01:04:26,251 --> 01:04:29,163
- No. I'm sorry.
- You gotta do it.

928
01:04:29,251 --> 01:04:30,843
What?

929
01:04:30,931 --> 01:04:32,922
No, no, no, no, no. I can't.

930
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:36,720
Please. You are the only one in Las Vegas
who knows our routine.

931
01:04:36,811 --> 01:04:42,168
- The dodgeball championship's at noon.
- You'll be back in time. I promise.

932
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:46,682
- All right, I'll do it.
- Yes.

933
01:04:46,771 --> 01:04:48,807
- I gotta tell the guys.
- No. No time.

934
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:50,482
- I gotta tell the guys.
- No time.

935
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:57,080
Average Joe's are a 50-1 underdog here today.
No one is giving them much of a chance.

936
01:04:57,170 --> 01:04:58,923
What do you think, Pep?

937
01:04:59,010 --> 01:05:01,080
I spoke to White Goodman before the match

938
01:05:01,171 --> 01:05:06,085
and he told me that his team
really wants to win this one.

939
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:09,446
Right. And the stage is set for
Darwin's cruellest play to unfold.

940
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:13,159
So don't go anywhere, folks.
The Schadenfreude is about to begin.

941
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:17,401
- I don't understand. Why would Peter leave?
- He knows we're gonna get killed.

942
01:05:17,490 --> 01:05:22,564
Hey. That's not true. I don't know why Peter
left, but we can do this without him.

943
01:05:22,649 --> 01:05:25,722
We just have to figure it out.
Owen, you'll have to play.

944
01:05:25,809 --> 01:05:29,085
- OK, yeah.
- Great. But we'll still be two players short.

945
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:33,129
We're still missing the teenage love-puppy
and Steve the Pirate.

946
01:05:33,209 --> 01:05:35,565
Who's Steve the Pirate?

947
01:05:35,649 --> 01:05:39,359
The only guy on our team
who dresses like a pirate.

948
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:43,442
Wait. There's a guy on our team
dressed like a pirate?

949
01:05:44,969 --> 01:05:52,398
And now, let's hear it for the West Davenport
High School Charging Donkeys.

950
01:05:52,489 --> 01:05:54,480
Donkeys.

951
01:06:18,088 --> 01:06:19,647
Go, Donkeys.

952
01:06:22,369 --> 01:06:25,280
- We did it.
- Holy cow. My God.

953
01:06:25,369 --> 01:06:28,600
- It was perfect. You were perfect.
- God, I gotta go.

954
01:06:28,688 --> 01:06:30,883
Wait. Aren't you gonna stay for the trophy?

955
01:06:30,968 --> 01:06:33,641
I'm sorry, Amber. I got my own trophy to win.

956
01:06:49,688 --> 01:06:52,077
Now I'm going.

957
01:06:56,887 --> 01:07:01,439
Here come the Purple Cobras,
led by White Goodman. All business.

958
01:07:01,527 --> 01:07:04,963
We haven't seen Average Joe's yet.
They haven't made it to the court.

959
01:07:05,048 --> 01:07:08,437
It could be a psychological ploy,
or something worse.

960
01:07:08,527 --> 01:07:12,759
They're definitely not on the court, Cotton.
Their absence is noticeable.

961
01:07:12,848 --> 01:07:17,443
We'll be right back
after these words from our sponsors...

962
01:07:19,047 --> 01:07:21,277
Can I get a bottle of water?

963
01:07:23,687 --> 01:07:25,917
Aren't you Peter La Fleur?

964
01:07:26,927 --> 01:07:30,522
- Lance Armstrong?
- Yeah, that's me. But I'm a big fan of yours.

965
01:07:30,607 --> 01:07:34,316
- Really?
- Yeah, I've been watching the dodgeball.

966
01:07:34,407 --> 01:07:39,196
I just can't get enough of it. I'm really pullin'
for you against those jerks from Globo Gym.

967
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:43,082
I think you better hurry up
or you're gonna be late.

968
01:07:43,167 --> 01:07:47,479
- Actually, I decided to quit, Lance.
- Quit?

969
01:07:48,286 --> 01:07:54,156
Once I thought of quittin', when I had brain,
lung and testicular cancer at the same time.

970
01:07:54,846 --> 01:07:57,519
But with the support of my friends
I got back on the bike

971
01:07:57,606 --> 01:08:00,200
and I won the Tour de France
five times in a row.

972
01:08:00,287 --> 01:08:04,165
But I'm sure you have a good reason to quit.

973
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:07,636
What are you dying from
that's keepin' you from the finals?

974
01:08:07,726 --> 01:08:11,765
Right now, it feels a little bit like shame.

975
01:08:11,846 --> 01:08:17,443
If people never quit when the going got tough
they'd have nothing to regret all their lives.

976
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:22,316
Good luck to you, Peter. I'm sure
this decision won't haunt you forever.

977
01:08:28,526 --> 01:08:32,438
Steve? Steve the Pirate? "Scurvy."

978
01:08:32,526 --> 01:08:36,564
- No. Not ringing any bells.
- Forget it, man.

979
01:08:36,646 --> 01:08:40,763
We'll play with four people. It's not
an advantage. Can't you bend the rules?

980
01:08:40,845 --> 01:08:45,043
There's nothing I can do. Rules are rules.
You don't have enough players.

981
01:08:45,126 --> 01:08:49,004
Inform the committee and Mr Goodman
about Average Joe's forfeit.

982
01:08:49,085 --> 01:08:52,236
- Yes, sir.
- Better luck next year.

983
01:08:53,845 --> 01:08:55,358
Excuse me.

984
01:08:55,445 --> 01:08:58,755
Sorry I'm late. You won't believe
whatjust happened. Hey, guys.

985
01:08:58,845 --> 01:09:01,517
You're just in time to help us forfeit.

986
01:09:01,605 --> 01:09:03,596
Forfeit? Why?

987
01:09:05,404 --> 01:09:08,476
Well, I don't know what to tell you, but...

988
01:09:08,565 --> 01:09:12,444
Yes, I'm being told that Average Joe's
does not have enough players

989
01:09:12,524 --> 01:09:15,357
and will be forfeiting
the championship match.

990
01:09:15,445 --> 01:09:18,402
It's a bold strategy, Cotton.
Let's see if it pays off for 'em.

991
01:09:18,485 --> 01:09:23,956
To the tournament floor we go, for the sceptre
presentation from the Dodgeball Chancellor.

992
01:09:24,044 --> 01:09:27,673
Ladies and gentlemen,
by the power vested in me

993
01:09:27,765 --> 01:09:32,792
by our governing body, the American
Dodgeball Association of America,

994
01:09:32,884 --> 01:09:37,400
and in concurrence with our sponsors,
Lumber Liquidators and Omaha Steaks,

995
01:09:37,484 --> 01:09:39,554
it gives me great pleasure

996
01:09:39,644 --> 01:09:44,354
to declare the winner of this year's
Las Vegas International Tournament to be...

997
01:09:44,444 --> 01:09:46,594
Wait. He's here.

998
01:09:50,884 --> 01:09:53,557
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

999
01:09:53,644 --> 01:09:55,679
We're ready to play, Your Honour.

1000
01:09:55,764 --> 01:10:00,519
Too late. Your lovable band of losers already
forfeited. The trophy and money are mine.

1001
01:10:00,604 --> 01:10:03,960
He's right. The team already forfeited.
There's nothing you can do.

1002
01:10:04,044 --> 01:10:06,604
Facial, La Fleur. Total facial.

1003
01:10:07,724 --> 01:10:09,520
Actually, that's not true.

1004
01:10:09,604 --> 01:10:13,722
The committee can overrule the chancellor -
that's you, sir - by a two-thirds vote.

1005
01:10:13,803 --> 01:10:16,033
He's right. He's right. It's a bylaw.

1006
01:10:18,124 --> 01:10:20,637
- It's a bylaw.
- What's a bylaw?

1007
01:10:21,603 --> 01:10:25,039
- Hang on a second here, folks.
- Let them play.

1008
01:10:25,123 --> 01:10:28,877
We mightjust have a championship game yet.

1009
01:10:28,963 --> 01:10:31,921
Listen to this crowd.

1010
01:10:32,003 --> 01:10:34,119
Unbelievable.

1011
01:10:34,203 --> 01:10:39,322
Pepper, it's clear what the crowd wants, but
the committee members have the final say.

1012
01:10:39,403 --> 01:10:42,520
And it looks like they've come to a decision.

1013
01:10:42,603 --> 01:10:45,276
Joe's needs two "yes" votes to play.

1014
01:10:45,362 --> 01:10:48,638
- There's a thumbs-up. Good news for Joe's.
- Please.

1015
01:10:48,723 --> 01:10:51,795
- Let's see how our second judge votes.
- Thank you.

1016
01:10:51,883 --> 01:10:58,754
Oh, tough sledding there. It's all even. Their
fate hangs on the thumb of our final judge.

1017
01:10:58,843 --> 01:11:02,198
Thumbs up. Average Joe's can play.

1018
01:11:02,283 --> 01:11:05,433
That is pure poppycock.
You're gonna let them do that?

1019
01:11:05,522 --> 01:11:08,878
- Thank you, Chuck Norris.
- Thank you, Peter.

1020
01:11:10,602 --> 01:11:14,117
All right, captains. Shake hands,
and let's have a clean match.

1021
01:11:14,202 --> 01:11:16,193
Good luck, White.

1022
01:11:17,642 --> 01:11:20,714
Cram it up your cramhole, La Fleur.

1023
01:11:20,802 --> 01:11:24,111
Prepare to be humiliated on cable television.

1024
01:11:24,202 --> 01:11:26,193
Whatever.

1025
01:11:28,082 --> 01:11:31,154
- Nice of you to show up.
- Yeah, I thought so too.

1026
01:11:31,242 --> 01:11:34,039
What? I got a plan.

1027
01:11:35,882 --> 01:11:41,672
Let's play smart. Wait for two-on-ones. Cover
closely for your pick-ups. What's our motto?

1028
01:11:41,762 --> 01:11:43,877
- "Aim low".
- That's right.

1029
01:11:43,962 --> 01:11:46,840
All I'm asking is that
you give it your best for Patches.

1030
01:11:46,921 --> 01:11:51,039
I say we go out there, let it all hang loose,
try to have some fun.

1031
01:11:51,121 --> 01:11:53,681
I mean, it's only dodgeball, right?

1032
01:11:53,761 --> 01:11:57,640
- Put 'em in. One, two, three.
- Joe's.

1033
01:12:20,321 --> 01:12:22,516
Globo Gym, ready?

1034
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:25,399
Average Joe's, ready?

1035
01:12:27,601 --> 01:12:28,555
Dodgeball.

1036
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:33,873
Championship match is under way.
Average Joe's versus the Globo Gym Goliath.

1037
01:12:35,121 --> 01:12:37,759
Quick elimination there for Kate Veatch.

1038
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:42,157
White Goodman's hit,
but that ball's up for grabs. And...

1039
01:12:42,241 --> 01:12:44,117
- It's caught.
- That's a catch.

1040
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,636
- You're out, La Fleur.
- Peter La Fleur has gotta sit down.

1041
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:50,837
And Joe's has lost
their two best players early.

1042
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,270
Dwight Baumgarten still playing hard.

1043
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,920
Hits Me'Shell Jones right on the dome.

1044
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,910
You're mine next time.

1045
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:05,910
Right in the tokus.
2-1, <i>ese,</i> and Globo Gym is dominating.

1046
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:12,155
- Hi.
- Hey.

1047
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:16,633
- You're out.
- I don't know what that was,

1048
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:21,316
but it leaves Joe's on the wrong side
of a 4-2 advantage.

1049
01:13:21,399 --> 01:13:24,311
Joe's gets an elimination. It's two on three.

1050
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:25,957
Get out.

1051
01:13:26,039 --> 01:13:28,314
Gordo. Lose your temper. Get mad.

1052
01:13:30,199 --> 01:13:34,192
White Goodman with a catch. Gordon Pibb
goes out, Me'Shell Jones comes back in.

1053
01:13:34,279 --> 01:13:35,997
You're out, four-eyes.

1054
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:40,356
Well, it's all up to Average Joe's youngest
member. He's gotta make a play here, Pepper.

1055
01:13:40,439 --> 01:13:42,077
Word, Cotton.

1056
01:13:42,158 --> 01:13:47,312
Four Cobras and one Joe. Even a rabid
mongoose wouldn't have a chance now.

1057
01:13:47,399 --> 01:13:50,038
- Nice dodge.
- Stay alive. Stay alive.

1058
01:13:52,039 --> 01:13:54,348
They're just toying with the young man now.

1059
01:13:54,439 --> 01:13:57,271
He's gotta avoid getting hit. That's the key.

1060
01:13:57,358 --> 01:13:59,110
Justin, let's go.

1061
01:14:00,279 --> 01:14:01,757
What a great catch.

1062
01:14:01,838 --> 01:14:05,069
And another.
Peter La Fleur comes back into the game.

1063
01:14:05,158 --> 01:14:09,038
Just like that, a three-player swing.
Joe's isn't done yet.

1064
01:14:09,118 --> 01:14:10,677
Justin.

1065
01:14:10,758 --> 01:14:13,227
I love you.

1066
01:14:13,318 --> 01:14:15,149
I love you t...

1067
01:14:15,838 --> 01:14:17,795
Joanie loves Chachi.

1068
01:14:17,878 --> 01:14:21,473
Two players left on each side.
What a match. What a sport.

1069
01:14:22,078 --> 01:14:27,550
Throw out the rule book, folks,
it's down and dirty now. Street dodgeball.

1070
01:14:29,197 --> 01:14:32,873
Look out. La Fleur goes down -
he's a sitting duck.

1071
01:14:37,758 --> 01:14:43,673
How about that, folks? Kate Veatch takes the
bullet for Peter La Fleur. Now that's sacrifice.

1072
01:14:43,758 --> 01:14:48,513
As touching a moment as we've seen
on the dodgeball court all tournament.

1073
01:14:49,277 --> 01:14:51,838
A blatant cheap shot from White Goodman.

1074
01:14:51,917 --> 01:14:56,433
- That's court misconduct. That's a warning.
- Come on. Gimme a break.

1075
01:14:57,517 --> 01:14:58,996
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1076
01:14:59,077 --> 01:15:01,466
- Jesus. Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

1077
01:15:01,557 --> 01:15:04,594
- It was an accident. I thought she was in play.
- Not a chance.

1078
01:15:04,677 --> 01:15:07,589
We're sweating like greased monkeys.
I can't hold on to a ball.

1079
01:15:07,677 --> 01:15:10,794
Sorry, miss, but you're out.
You gotta get off the court.

1080
01:15:10,877 --> 01:15:12,595
Watch him, man.

1081
01:15:12,677 --> 01:15:14,907
- Hey, Peter.
- Yeah?

1082
01:15:14,996 --> 01:15:16,715
Kick his ass.

1083
01:15:17,277 --> 01:15:20,313
- Here's the restart.
- Players, to your positions.

1084
01:15:20,397 --> 01:15:24,709
Looks like it's gonna be a two-on-one,
a <i>ménage à trois</i> of pain.

1085
01:15:24,797 --> 01:15:28,391
Usually you pay double
for that kind of action, Cotton.

1086
01:15:30,277 --> 01:15:33,871
You're playing ready dodgeball.
Balls are at your feet.

1087
01:15:33,957 --> 01:15:36,186
Ready? Dodgeball.

1088
01:15:36,277 --> 01:15:41,192
It's a cat-and-mouse game, folks.
Peter La Fleur has gotta wait for his shot.

1089
01:15:44,516 --> 01:15:46,950
He gets the elimination.

1090
01:15:48,116 --> 01:15:53,634
My. Globo Gym wins.
A Cinderella story cast asunder.

1091
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:57,675
Average Joe's has come all this way
for nothing. Absolutely nothing.

1092
01:15:57,756 --> 01:16:00,395
They're not gonna get anything, Cotton.

1093
01:16:01,516 --> 01:16:05,475
No elimination. Double fault.
You stepped over the line on the throw.

1094
01:16:05,556 --> 01:16:09,434
What? You gotta be out of your mind.
That is the worst call I've ever seen.

1095
01:16:09,516 --> 01:16:13,714
I'm out here busting my butt and you come in
with a bush-league call like that? Bullcrap.

1096
01:16:13,795 --> 01:16:18,631
ADAA Continuation Rule 113-D, sir.
Sudden death.

1097
01:16:18,715 --> 01:16:20,114
All right. Bring it.

1098
01:16:20,196 --> 01:16:23,505
I don't believe it, folks. Sudden death.

1099
01:16:23,596 --> 01:16:25,267
Well, let me tell you,

1100
01:16:25,355 --> 01:16:30,952
a double-fault final-play elimination hasn't
occurred since the Helsinki episode of 1919,

1101
01:16:31,035 --> 01:16:33,674
and I think we all remember
how that turned out.

1102
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:40,149
Ladies and gentlemen, it's the greatest
happening in sport. Sudden-death dodgeball.

1103
01:16:40,235 --> 01:16:42,544
Pepper needs new shorts.

1104
01:16:44,475 --> 01:16:47,592
White, Peter, this is sudden death.

1105
01:16:48,035 --> 01:16:53,393
Only striking an opposing player eliminates
them. Catching the ball does nothing.

1106
01:16:53,475 --> 01:16:57,309
Both feet must remain
in the triangle at all times.

1107
01:16:57,395 --> 01:17:01,910
You may throw any time after my call.
Understood?

1108
01:17:02,794 --> 01:17:06,470
OK. Let's have a clean match.
Good luck, gentlemen.

1109
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:09,752
This is it, La Loser.

1110
01:17:11,154 --> 01:17:14,703
You ready for the hurricane?

1111
01:17:15,754 --> 01:17:19,349
Just don't go cryin' to mama when
I spank you in front of all these people.

1112
01:17:20,474 --> 01:17:25,309
You don't go crying to your daddy
after I wipe it up with your face.

1113
01:17:26,874 --> 01:17:29,672
- White?
- Yeah?

1114
01:17:29,754 --> 01:17:34,191
- You look awful fat in those pants.
- Players, to your positions.

1115
01:17:34,274 --> 01:17:37,903
This is about gamesmanship.
Throw early and you're defenceless.

1116
01:17:37,994 --> 01:17:43,830
Throw late and you're eliminated.
Dilemma, thy name is dodgeball.

1117
01:17:43,913 --> 01:17:46,906
This sport doesn't build character,
it reveals it.

1118
01:17:46,994 --> 01:17:49,951
Effin' A, Cotton. Effin' A.

1119
01:17:51,713 --> 01:17:53,704
Come on, talk to me.

1120
01:17:55,234 --> 01:17:57,383
Listen up, crotch stain.

1121
01:17:57,473 --> 01:18:01,671
Remember your training
and trust your instincts.

1122
01:18:01,753 --> 01:18:04,426
You can do it. I believe in you.

1123
01:18:07,233 --> 01:18:08,951
Bye-bye.

1124
01:18:09,033 --> 01:18:10,022
Right.

1125
01:18:10,113 --> 01:18:12,911
Players, turn and step in.

1126
01:18:28,033 --> 01:18:30,501
What the hell's he doing?

1127
01:18:30,593 --> 01:18:33,106
I don't know.

1128
01:18:35,153 --> 01:18:36,347
Get a load of this guy.

1129
01:18:36,432 --> 01:18:40,061
In 23 years of broadcasting
I thought I'd seen it all, folks.

1130
01:18:40,152 --> 01:18:43,906
But it looks like Peter La Fleur
has actually blindfolded himself.

1131
01:18:43,992 --> 01:18:46,665
He will not be able to see very well, Cotton.

1132
01:18:55,832 --> 01:18:58,300
Ready?

1133
01:19:02,912 --> 01:19:05,267
Dodgeball.

1134
01:19:11,032 --> 01:19:13,227
Goodbye, Peter.

1135
01:19:13,311 --> 01:19:16,031
I always knew you were weak.

1136
01:19:19,391 --> 01:19:22,064
Air Goodman, comin' at ya.

1137
01:19:29,591 --> 01:19:32,583
Down goes Goodman.
Down goes Goodman.

1138
01:19:32,671 --> 01:19:35,868
Winner. Average Joe's.

1139
01:19:39,191 --> 01:19:42,740
Do you believe in unlikelihoods?

1140
01:19:42,831 --> 01:19:45,948
Average Joe's shocking the dodgeball world

1141
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:50,070
and upsetting Globo Gym
in the championship match.

1142
01:19:50,151 --> 01:19:51,469
Unbelievable.

1143
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:55,828
I have been to the Great Wall of China.
I have seen the Pyramids of Egypt.

1144
01:19:55,911 --> 01:19:58,424
I've even witnessed a grown man
satisfy a camel.

1145
01:19:58,511 --> 01:20:00,740
But never in all my years as a sportscaster

1146
01:20:00,831 --> 01:20:05,779
have I witnessed something as improbable,
as impossible, as what we've witnessed here.

1147
01:20:05,870 --> 01:20:10,466
The little team that could, Average Joe's
Gymnasium, underdogs throughout,

1148
01:20:10,551 --> 01:20:15,226
stand before us, aglow,
as true dodgeball champions.

1149
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:19,781
On behalf of the American Dodgeball
Association of America,

1150
01:20:19,870 --> 01:20:24,182
it is my honour to present to you
this cheque for $50,000.

1151
01:20:30,190 --> 01:20:33,148
What are you so happy about, La Fleur?
None of this matters.

1152
01:20:33,230 --> 01:20:37,542
You signed your gym over to me last night,
remember? You lost, I won.

1153
01:20:37,630 --> 01:20:39,700
Suck failure, freaks.

1154
01:20:39,790 --> 01:20:42,907
Peter, is that true?

1155
01:20:42,990 --> 01:20:44,900
Yeah, it's true.

1156
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:48,186
It's true I sold Average Joe's to White.

1157
01:20:48,270 --> 01:20:50,625
It's true that every man has his price.

1158
01:20:50,709 --> 01:20:55,500
And it's also true that money won
is a lot sweeter than money earned.

1159
01:20:55,589 --> 01:20:59,788
- Now he's a philosophiser.
- Excuse us. Step aside, please.

1160
01:21:00,869 --> 01:21:03,178
Your winnings, Mr La Fleur.
Congratulations.

1161
01:21:03,269 --> 01:21:07,148
- Right on time. I appreciate it. Thank you.
- What is that? What winnings?

1162
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:11,700
Gosh, I totally forgot to tell you. I took the
$100,000 bribe that you gave me last night,

1163
01:21:11,789 --> 01:21:14,747
and I put it on us to win.
We were going off at 50-1.

1164
01:21:14,829 --> 01:21:18,105
Anyone? Top of your head?
What's 50 times $100,000?

1165
01:21:18,189 --> 01:21:19,542
$50,000?

1166
01:21:19,629 --> 01:21:23,542
$5 million. Peter, are you kidding me?

1167
01:21:23,628 --> 01:21:25,699
Surprise.

1168
01:21:28,869 --> 01:21:33,784
Stick it in your ear, La Fleur. I wouldn't sell
you your gym back for all King Midas's silver.

1169
01:21:33,869 --> 01:21:38,544
The gym is mine. So you can take your band
of yellow-bellied losers and crawl out of here.

1170
01:21:38,629 --> 01:21:41,462
You're right. I can't make you
sell Average Joe's to me.

1171
01:21:41,548 --> 01:21:45,223
So I guess I'll just take your advice
and invest in something.

1172
01:21:45,308 --> 01:21:49,382
- Say the controlling stake of Globo Gym.
- That's preposterous. I'd never allow it.

1173
01:21:49,468 --> 01:21:53,097
Globo Gym is a publicly traded company.
There's nothing you can do about it.

1174
01:21:53,188 --> 01:21:58,421
So I would control Globo Gym
and everything that Globo Gym owns,

1175
01:21:58,508 --> 01:22:02,501
which, as of last night, is Average Joe's Gym.

1176
01:22:03,828 --> 01:22:05,227
I'm your new boss, White.

1177
01:22:05,308 --> 01:22:08,583
You can't be my boss. Nobody can.
I'm my own boss. I created myself.

1178
01:22:08,668 --> 01:22:11,740
- You're fired, pal.
- You can't do anything to me.

1179
01:22:12,268 --> 01:22:15,226
You're going down, La Fleur,
like a sweet muffin.

1180
01:22:15,307 --> 01:22:18,778
- Another time, another time.
- You suck, La Fleur.

1181
01:22:20,588 --> 01:22:22,579
Give me that.

1182
01:22:25,347 --> 01:22:27,815
Man, the blindfold was crazy.

1183
01:22:29,267 --> 01:22:31,782
Peter.

1184
01:22:31,867 --> 01:22:34,336
Look. It's Steve the Pirate.

1185
01:22:37,827 --> 01:22:42,821
I just wanted to tell you
that I thought about what you said, and

1186
01:22:43,827 --> 01:22:46,057
I guess you're right.

1187
01:22:46,147 --> 01:22:48,422
I'm not really a pirate.

1188
01:22:49,707 --> 01:22:52,175
I don't know, Steve.

1189
01:22:52,267 --> 01:22:54,382
If you're not a pirate,

1190
01:22:54,467 --> 01:22:58,175
who the hell am I gonna split
all that buried treasure with?

1191
01:23:03,107 --> 01:23:04,904
Peter...

1192
01:23:04,986 --> 01:23:06,784
Gar, Steve.

1193
01:23:12,106 --> 01:23:13,698
We missed you.

1194
01:23:16,586 --> 01:23:18,178
Hey, you.

1195
01:23:18,266 --> 01:23:20,257
Hey, you.

1196
01:23:21,906 --> 01:23:23,862
- Joyce?
- Kate.

1197
01:23:24,306 --> 01:23:28,584
- I thought you were in Guam.
- I caught an early flight. I wouldn't miss this.

1198
01:23:28,666 --> 01:23:30,861
You are amazing.

1199
01:23:34,386 --> 01:23:38,777
- I told you she was a lesbian.
- Wow. Good call.

1200
01:23:39,265 --> 01:23:42,258
Hey. I'm not a lesbian.

1201
01:23:42,346 --> 01:23:43,938
You're not?

1202
01:23:44,026 --> 01:23:45,505
No.

1203
01:23:45,586 --> 01:23:47,941
I'm bisexual.

1204
01:23:49,506 --> 01:23:51,337
Snap.

1205
01:23:51,906 --> 01:23:55,261
All right, everybody. Smile big.

1206
01:23:59,945 --> 01:24:03,699
Hi. I'm Peter La Fleur,
owner and operator of Average Joe's Gym.

1207
01:24:03,785 --> 01:24:07,300
I'm here to tell you
you're perfectjust the way you are.

1208
01:24:07,385 --> 01:24:12,857
But if you feel like losin' a few pounds, gettin'
healthier, and makin' friends in the process,

1209
01:24:12,945 --> 01:24:14,697
Joe's is the place for you.

1210
01:24:14,785 --> 01:24:18,095
Don't forget that youth dodgeball classes
are forming right now.

1211
01:24:18,185 --> 01:24:22,861
So come on down and learn a great game the
way it's supposed to be played. Right, kids?

1212
01:24:22,945 --> 01:24:24,936
Right.

1213
01:24:34,065 --> 01:24:36,101
Spare me.

1214
01:24:36,184 --> 01:24:38,573
I won that tournament.

1215
01:24:41,145 --> 01:24:43,863
Fucking Chuck Norris.

1216

1218
01:27:41,821 --> 01:27:44,857
Yeah. I hope you're all happy now.

1219
01:27:44,941 --> 01:27:47,375
Good guy wins, bad guy loses.

1220
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:49,929
Big friggin' surprise.

1221
01:27:50,981 --> 01:27:52,891
I love happy endings.

1222
01:27:55,780 --> 01:27:59,979
You know, that's the problem
with the American cinema.

1223
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:02,449
Can't handle any complexity in it, you know?

1224
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:06,579
"Don't make me think,
I just wanna be entertained."

1225
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:08,491
All right, fine.

1226
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:12,095
You want a little somethin'-somethin'
for the ride home?

1227
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:14,568
Check these boots out for size.

1228
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:18,455
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard

1229
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:20,609
And they're like, "It's better than yours"

1230
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:22,576
Damn right, it's better than yours

1231
01:28:22,660 --> 01:28:25,220
I could teach you, but I'd have to charge

1232
01:28:26,220 --> 01:28:30,212
What the boys go crazy for

1233
01:28:31,499 --> 01:28:32,615
They lose their minds

1234
01:28:32,699 --> 01:28:34,975
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard

1235
01:28:35,059 --> 01:28:36,778
Damn right, it's better than yours

1236
01:28:36,859 --> 01:28:40,329
I could teach you, but I'd have to charge

1237
01:28:41,980 --> 01:28:44,937
You happy? Fatty make a funny?
