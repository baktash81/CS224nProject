the town of Big Lake, Texas --

2
00:00:43,372 --> 00:00:46,170
a story of the town's
beginnings.

3
00:00:46,241 --> 00:00:49,802
It's the story
of the Santa Rita Number One,

4
00:00:49,878 --> 00:00:52,780
birthplace
of West Texas Oil.

5
00:00:52,849 --> 00:00:56,012
Now, as with
most Texas legends,

6
00:00:56,086 --> 00:01:00,648
there was a man who thought oil
was right beneath his feet.

7
00:01:00,724 --> 00:01:03,284
And as with
most such stories,

8
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,693
no one else believed him.

9
00:01:09,232 --> 00:01:12,861

for two nuns,

10
00:01:12,936 --> 00:01:15,336

11

and his dream

12
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:24,645

no one knew they had.

13

Now, when the nuns told
their parish priest

14

and their investment in it,

15
00:01:39,063 --> 00:01:43,262

to try and get their money back.

that it was too late,

was already spent.

Well, the priest, he sighed,
shook his head,

19
00:01:54,846 --> 00:01:59,408

one small bit of advice --
