1
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,712
<i>Since the dawn of man, the vampires
have walked among us, killing, feeding.</i>

2
00:00:34,042 --> 00:00:38,991
<i>The only one with the strength or skill
to stop their heinous evil is the Slayer...</i>

3
00:00:39,297 --> 00:00:42,767
<i>... she who bears the birthmark,
the mark of the coven.</i>

4
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:48,448
<i>Trained by the Watcher,
one slayer dies and the next is chosen.</i>

5
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:51,925
And I shall be his sword.

6
00:00:52,103 --> 00:00:54,094
Let Satan tremble.

7
00:00:54,273 --> 00:00:57,026
The Slayer is born.

8
00:02:41,642 --> 00:02:45,635
OK, people. They're psyching you out.
Let's not be so defensive out there.

9
00:02:45,896 --> 00:02:51,129
What do we say on the court? Repeat after
me. "I am a person. I have a right to the ball."

10
00:02:51,444 --> 00:02:55,437
Good. Now, here's our key play.
We're gonna... Are we the Xs or the Os?

11
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:58,293
- We're the Os.
- Oh. Oh, right. OK.

12
00:03:48,966 --> 00:03:50,957
Mr Howard is so heinous.

13
00:03:52,512 --> 00:03:54,548
He's always giving me a hard time.

14
00:03:54,723 --> 00:03:58,557
I get a C plus on the test, and he tells me
"You have no sense of history."

15
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:02,042
I have no sense of history?
He wears a brown tie.

16
00:04:02,273 --> 00:04:06,186
You got a C plus?
I can't believe I cheated off of you.

17
00:04:06,444 --> 00:04:09,117
Excuse me for
not knowing about El Salvador.

18
00:04:09,322 --> 00:04:11,552
Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway.

19
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:14,976
Oh, wow. Look at thatjacket.

20
00:04:18,249 --> 00:04:20,558
Oh, this is so lush.

21
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:26,141
- Wouldn't you guys just love me in this?
- Guys, what's the sitch? I'm bored.

22
00:04:26,425 --> 00:04:30,577
- What do you think?
- Please. It's so five minutes ago.

23
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,202
- Yeah!
- Oh.

24
00:04:35,143 --> 00:04:36,371
What are we doing?

25
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,670
- Why don't we go see a movie?
- Where?

26
00:04:38,856 --> 00:04:41,051
- Omniplex?
- Nee sitch. No way.

27
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:43,383
- No THX.
- They don't even have Dolby.

28
00:04:43,611 --> 00:04:44,885
- Sorry.
- Beverly Center.

29
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:47,782
- They show previews for foreign movies.
- Oh, yeah.

30
00:04:47,991 --> 00:04:50,061
<i>- AMC?
-Bogus corn.</i>

31
00:04:50,244 --> 00:04:53,680
Totally stale. And the ushers are,
like, the acne patrol. Totally.

32
00:04:53,914 --> 00:04:58,783
OK. OK. How about...
We're thinking Pavilion? Sitch solved?

33
00:04:59,086 --> 00:05:02,362
- Sounds toasty.
- Excellent. What's playing there?

34
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,820
I don't know. Does it matter?

35
00:05:05,218 --> 00:05:09,097
- Excuse much. Rude or anything?
- Nice ensemble.

36
00:05:09,598 --> 00:05:12,271
What a homeless.

37
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:24,588
Is Jeffrey really
spending the night at your house?

38
00:05:24,781 --> 00:05:27,659
- That's the plan.
- Ooh! What a sitch.

39
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:31,178
- Your parents are always away. You're lucky.
- Hey.

40
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:33,563
- I guess.
- Mine don't. I'll die a virgin.

41
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,503
You guys shut up, please.

42
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,145
It could happen.

43
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,330
God, what a 'tude.

44
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:43,500
- Boo.
- Aargh.

45
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,668
It's the Loch Ness monster!

46
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,153
God, take a chill lozenge.

47
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:51,421
- Like we don't have rights too.
- Yeah.

48
00:05:51,603 --> 00:05:53,594
Ignore them, OK? Ignore them.

49
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,592
Oh, no, no. I can't believe these people.
We paid good money to see this.

50
00:05:58,861 --> 00:06:01,898
- No, we didn't.
- Oh, yeah.

51
00:06:06,704 --> 00:06:12,973
Look at the street. They're all
lining up for me because I am the champ!

52
00:06:13,336 --> 00:06:16,726
- Whoo!
- Look at the moon, man. It's a huge moon.

53
00:06:16,964 --> 00:06:19,524
Guys, tonight we gotta go out and party.

54
00:06:19,718 --> 00:06:23,472
If you spent more time sleeping,
you'd spend less time on the court sucking.

55
00:06:23,722 --> 00:06:26,475
You were a bonehead out there yesterday.

56
00:06:26,684 --> 00:06:31,200
Anyway, I'm booked. Gotta spend
some quality time with the little lady.

57
00:06:31,606 --> 00:06:35,440
- Pushover. You're such a pushover.
- You guys are pathetic.

58
00:06:35,694 --> 00:06:39,130
- I'm blowing. Andy, you coming?
- I'll catch a ride with Jeffrey.

59
00:06:39,364 --> 00:06:41,924
- Later.
- Slam dunk.

60
00:06:42,118 --> 00:06:44,109
Later.

61
00:06:59,136 --> 00:07:02,731
Jeffrey, I don't wanna sound sexist
or anything, but can I borrow her?

62
00:07:02,974 --> 00:07:04,885
- Andy.
- No way.

63
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,052
You'd get her dirty.
He would, honey. He's an animal.

64
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:11,581
- See you at my house.
- Don't look.

65
00:07:32,299 --> 00:07:34,415
Oh, man.

66
00:07:34,592 --> 00:07:36,981
I'm not in the mood for this.

67
00:07:37,179 --> 00:07:40,216
OK, whoever's behind me
better be gone when I turn around.

68
00:07:42,434 --> 00:07:46,347
What are you? Are you some kind
of weirdo or somethin'? Huh?

69
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:54,748
<i>The cause of death was
a neck wound that resembled...</i>

70
00:07:54,948 --> 00:07:58,463
<i>... in the words of one bystander,
"a really gross hickey".</i>

71
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:04,869
<i>In a related story, the body of the third slasher
victim has disappeared from the morgue.</i>

72
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,202
- There it is.
- Have fun. Be good. Stay away from the Jag.

73
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:10,697
I know.

74
00:08:10,883 --> 00:08:13,522
- That's everything.
- Bye.

75
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:15,789
Kiss noise. Bye-bye, Bobby.

76
00:08:15,972 --> 00:08:19,408
<i>- Bye.
- ... victim was found today, the fourth.</i>

77
00:08:19,643 --> 00:08:23,477
<i>And Lulu just can't get pregnant.</i>

78
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:28,167
<i>- She thinks my name is Bobby?
- It's possible she thinks my name's Bobby.</i>

79
00:08:28,444 --> 00:08:30,674
Real quality-timer, huh?

80
00:08:30,864 --> 00:08:32,422
Mm.

81
00:08:32,574 --> 00:08:34,565
Something like that.

82
00:08:35,911 --> 00:08:38,061
Hey, it works for me.

83
00:08:38,247 --> 00:08:42,684
I mean, if they wanna leave you alone
in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...

84
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,511
<i>The weather hasn't disappointed us. Constant
sun and temperatures in the high 70s...</i>

85
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:50,791
<i>... have made every winter's day a beach day.</i>

86
00:09:24,966 --> 00:09:28,720
Oh, please. Show me a real slayer.

87
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,360
- Lothos.
- Will you people ever learn?

88
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:34,590
We can't be stopped.

89
00:09:40,817 --> 00:09:43,206
This is our world now.

90
00:09:52,496 --> 00:09:54,487
Wow.

91
00:10:05,469 --> 00:10:10,179
Sleep, my master, my own. Sleep.

92
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:14,138
I have already begun
building you a new family.

93
00:10:14,354 --> 00:10:19,986
Soon we will be legion. When you rise,
we will claim this place as our own.

94
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:23,072
Rubies will drip from your lips.

95
00:10:32,624 --> 00:10:33,898
Soon.

96
00:10:34,543 --> 00:10:39,663
The environment. I tell you, it's totally key.
The earth is in terrible shape. We could die.

97
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:42,400
- Sting's doing it.
- I thought he was doing Indians.

98
00:10:42,593 --> 00:10:45,346
- How about the homelesses?
- Move.

99
00:10:45,555 --> 00:10:48,513
Aren't there any sicknesses
that aren't too depressing?

100
00:10:48,725 --> 00:10:51,080
- Hi.
- What you guys doin'?

101
00:10:51,603 --> 00:10:55,994
- Senior dance. We need a theme.
- It has to be a socially conscious theme.

102
00:10:56,275 --> 00:10:59,506
One that reflects the students'
growing awareness of...

103
00:10:59,737 --> 00:11:02,251
...and involvement in the world around them.

104
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:04,440
<i>Downer.</i>

105
00:11:04,618 --> 00:11:07,212
I still say the environment.
That's my suggestion.

106
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:09,802
- Yeah, me too.
- Yes. It's gonna work.

107
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:14,072
What are the most immediate threats
to the world environment right now?

108
00:11:14,504 --> 00:11:16,699
Um... Litter?

109
00:11:16,882 --> 00:11:19,442
- Litter, yeah.
- Forest fires?

110
00:11:20,051 --> 00:11:22,519
- Bugs?
- Bugs, totally.

111
00:11:22,722 --> 00:11:24,713
- Yeah. I hate bugs.
- Yeah.

112
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,245
- Cassandra, write it down.
- OK, guys.

113
00:11:27,435 --> 00:11:30,188
<i>- What do you think about the ozone layer?</i>

114
00:11:30,396 --> 00:11:32,387
Yeah.

115
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:37,686
- Yeah. We gotta get rid of that.
- First bell, people. Time marches on.

116
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,502
- What's your point?
- Button it, Kramer.

117
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,692
Let's meet tonight, OK? Café Blasé?

118
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,869
- Cool. We can figure decorations and stuff.
- Yeah.

119
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:51,837
I don't know, guys. I really wanna
get a head start on my homework.

120
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,927
Oh, yeah. I love that one.

121
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:03,091
Buff, I don't see why
we have to invite every single senior.

122
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:07,393
Because it's the senior dance.
It's just a shot in the dark.

123
00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:12,376
So? I mean, like, why do we have
to invite Nadia? She's such a blemish.

124
00:12:12,652 --> 00:12:14,882
I know, you're right. She is.

125
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:17,062
Hi.

126
00:12:19,326 --> 00:12:22,557
- What?
- I thought that look was over.

127
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:26,122
- Well, it's retro.
- Yeah, retro.

128
00:12:27,585 --> 00:12:29,860
You can borrow it sometime.

129
00:12:30,046 --> 00:12:34,483
OK. Maybe I will. We were talking about
the senior dance, if you're interested.

130
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,035
You guys, look who's coming.

131
00:12:37,221 --> 00:12:39,860
- Ew!
- Sick!

132
00:12:45,647 --> 00:12:47,638
What does it look like?

133
00:12:51,153 --> 00:12:53,542
Two coffees or a hot dog.

134
00:12:54,157 --> 00:12:57,035
- Nothing on it and nothing on the side.
- Losers.

135
00:12:57,243 --> 00:13:00,633
- I'm Charlotte. I'll be your waitress.
- Hi, Charlotte.

136
00:13:00,872 --> 00:13:04,342
- Say something, Buffy.
- You guys are thrashed.

137
00:13:04,793 --> 00:13:06,784
- Just a little.
- Are we?

138
00:13:08,965 --> 00:13:12,082
That would explain the slurred speech.

139
00:13:12,301 --> 00:13:14,576
Thanks. What's your name?

140
00:13:16,681 --> 00:13:19,878
- Buffy.
- Yeah, it figures.

141
00:13:22,855 --> 00:13:24,925
I'm Pike.

142
00:13:25,107 --> 00:13:27,302
This is Benny.

143
00:13:29,737 --> 00:13:32,046
And I'm... Pike.

144
00:13:32,699 --> 00:13:34,929
Pike isn't a name. It's a fish.

145
00:13:38,038 --> 00:13:41,189
- Don't we know you guys?
- Hey, wait a minute.

146
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:43,851
You're the guys from the movie.

147
00:13:44,045 --> 00:13:46,081
We hate you guys.

148
00:13:46,506 --> 00:13:48,576
Like we care, I'm sure.

149
00:13:48,926 --> 00:13:52,157
Yeah. Boo-hoo.

150
00:13:52,388 --> 00:13:55,619
You guys were very rude, OK?
It was shocking.

151
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,762
- Well, you just snuck in anyway.
- Yeah.

152
00:13:59,813 --> 00:14:02,691
Hey, Buffy. You hungry?
I got something for ya.

153
00:14:07,946 --> 00:14:10,414
Oh, man. She wasted my dog.

154
00:14:16,498 --> 00:14:20,047
<i>I'll have it runnin' in a week.
All it needs is some brake pads.</i>

155
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:24,924
Shocks and tyres. A new engine, maybe.
It'll be totally cherry.

156
00:14:25,216 --> 00:14:28,572
When you get that car together,
let's bail. Get out of this town.

157
00:14:28,803 --> 00:14:31,556
Those rich bitches are a plague.
They gotta be stopped.

158
00:14:31,765 --> 00:14:33,801
You didn't like 'em? Give me that.

159
00:14:33,976 --> 00:14:37,286
I mean, they're all the same.
They're just so stuck-up.

160
00:14:37,521 --> 00:14:40,558
Pike, they're not even human. I hate 'em.

161
00:14:40,775 --> 00:14:42,766
Yeah, but would you bone 'em?

162
00:14:42,944 --> 00:14:45,378
Yes, definitely. Please, God.

163
00:14:45,572 --> 00:14:49,087
Especially the blonde.
I'd give my right eye for a piece of that.

164
00:14:49,327 --> 00:14:51,636
She's not even human.

165
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:54,787
Yes, but her yabos scoff at gravity.

166
00:14:54,999 --> 00:15:00,153
Man, you're disgusting. You don't even like
her and you'd sleep with her. What is that?

167
00:15:00,463 --> 00:15:03,694
I got news. Another shot of this
and I'll have sex with you.

168
00:15:03,926 --> 00:15:06,724
Oh, yeah. Then you'll never call me.

169
00:15:13,937 --> 00:15:19,534
- I think I'm gonna ralph.
- Hey, Benny, I'm here for you, man. I'm here.

170
00:15:21,195 --> 00:15:23,186
I'm here for you, Ralph.

171
00:15:28,036 --> 00:15:30,027
Oh, man.

172
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:51,050
This is not a very safe place
for you to fall asleep.

173
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,386
OK, Mom.

174
00:15:57,944 --> 00:16:01,334
<i>OK. Dribble, shoot, shoot.</i>

175
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,232
Take that ball to the hoop, hoop.

176
00:16:05,453 --> 00:16:07,489
- Right. Yeah.
- It's cool. I like that.

177
00:16:07,663 --> 00:16:09,654
- Bye.
- Hey, you guys, I was thinking.

178
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:15,226
For the senior dance, what if we made
a big sign that says "Don't Tread On Me"?

179
00:16:15,547 --> 00:16:17,742
You know? And a picture of the earth?

180
00:16:17,925 --> 00:16:22,237
How do you not tread on the earth?
I mean, you kind of have to, right?

181
00:16:22,513 --> 00:16:23,389
Oh.

182
00:16:23,514 --> 00:16:27,109
- Yeah, I never thought of that. Yeah.
- I gotta bail. You coming?

183
00:16:27,352 --> 00:16:33,188
No, you guys blow. I'm waiting on Cassandra.
She's gonna help me with my history. Wait.

184
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:39,714
I kinda loaned her Kimberly's yellow
leatherjacket, so don't tell her, all right?

185
00:16:40,283 --> 00:16:42,478
- OK. I won't. See ya.
- Bye.

186
00:16:57,511 --> 00:17:00,423
God! You scared me to death.

187
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,633
<i>- Where the hell'd you come from?
- That was very impressive. The tumbling.</i>

188
00:17:05,937 --> 00:17:08,690
What? Oh.

189
00:17:08,898 --> 00:17:12,811
I used to do gymnastics.
Are you looking for somebody?

190
00:17:13,403 --> 00:17:16,122
I was looking for you, actually.

191
00:17:16,323 --> 00:17:19,793
Why? Am I in trouble or something?
Cos if I am, I didn't do it.

192
00:17:21,287 --> 00:17:25,075
You're not in trouble, I am.
I'm years late. You should have been taught.

193
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:28,803
But I wasn't certain
until just now that it was you.

194
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:33,675
- What are you talking about?
- I've searched everywhere for you, Buffy.

195
00:17:35,469 --> 00:17:38,984
- Why?
- To bring you your birthright.

196
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:43,297
My birthright?
Is that, like, a trust fund or something?

197
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:50,009
I think it'll be easier for you to understand
this birthright if I show it to you.

198
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:55,647
All right? So you come
with me now to the graveyard.

199
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,066
Oh.

200
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,713
No, no, no, no.

201
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:03,587
My trust fund's in the graveyard?

202
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,783
God, what's your damage?

203
00:18:06,796 --> 00:18:08,229
Buffy?

204
00:18:08,381 --> 00:18:14,013
You're one of those skanky old men that
attacks little girls, right? Well, forget you.

205
00:18:14,638 --> 00:18:18,187
My name is Merrick,
and you have been chosen, Buffy.

206
00:18:20,102 --> 00:18:24,892
Chosen to go to the graveyard? Why don't
you just take the first runner-up, OK?

207
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:31,027
Everything depends on you, Buffy. You must
come to the graveyard while there's still time.

208
00:18:31,365 --> 00:18:35,074
- Time to do what?
- Time to stop the killing.

209
00:18:35,328 --> 00:18:40,880
- To stop the vampires.
- All right. Let me get this straight, OK?

210
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:44,485
You want me to go
to the graveyard with you...

211
00:18:44,712 --> 00:18:48,387
...because I'm the Chosen One
and there are vampires?

212
00:18:49,134 --> 00:18:50,806
Yes.

213
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,165
Does Elvis talk to you?

214
00:18:53,348 --> 00:18:57,227
Does he tell you to do things?
Do you see spots?

215
00:18:57,894 --> 00:19:00,806
Spots? Yes, of course.

216
00:19:01,022 --> 00:19:04,253
That's your proof. Spots.

217
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:08,736
You bear the mark.
You bear the mark of the coven.

218
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,981
What? That big old hairy mole?

219
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:13,150
Ew. I had that thing removed.

220
00:19:13,328 --> 00:19:16,923
You knowing about my big old mole
doesn't prove anything...

221
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:20,795
...except for it's way past
medication time for you, buddy.

222
00:19:21,045 --> 00:19:24,674
- Why don't you just stay away from me?
- Ever dream you were someone else?

223
00:19:24,924 --> 00:19:27,563
- Everybody does.
- Someone in the past.

224
00:19:28,261 --> 00:19:32,300
Someone real.
A Magyar peasant girl, perhaps.

225
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:34,628
An Indian princess?

226
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,801
A slave?

227
00:19:40,316 --> 00:19:43,353
- I was a slave.
- In Virginia.

228
00:19:43,863 --> 00:19:47,822
I don't know. There was, like,
this big farm or something.

229
00:19:50,286 --> 00:19:54,723
There was this one where
there were these knights, and I am a...

230
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,097
A servant girl. A barmaid.

231
00:19:59,546 --> 00:20:01,537
Oh, my God.

232
00:20:02,842 --> 00:20:08,917
Oh, my God. I never told anybody about this.
There's one where there's this man.

233
00:20:09,266 --> 00:20:11,985
I think he's a man.
He's in my dreams sometimes.

234
00:20:12,186 --> 00:20:14,495
I'm fighting him.

235
00:20:14,688 --> 00:20:18,681
Always fighting him. But he's so strong.

236
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:21,143
His name is Lothos.

237
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,766
How do you know all this?

238
00:20:27,952 --> 00:20:31,103
Because it is your birthright
and I am a part of it.

239
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:38,191
You come with me to the graveyard,
and I will show you.

240
00:20:43,386 --> 00:20:48,540
I can't believe I'm doing this. I can't believe
I'm in a graveyard with a strange man...

241
00:20:48,851 --> 00:20:52,400
...hunting for vampires on a school night.

242
00:20:52,647 --> 00:20:54,444
Ew.

243
00:20:54,607 --> 00:20:58,520
Why did you never
tell anyone about your dreams?

244
00:20:58,778 --> 00:21:02,009
Right. Tell everybody I'm crazy. Beauty idea.

245
00:21:02,241 --> 00:21:03,993
Ow.

246
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,755
- Cramps?
- None of your business. God.

247
00:21:07,997 --> 00:21:11,876
This is it.
Robert Berman was killed three days ago.

248
00:21:12,127 --> 00:21:15,437
His body was found
in the bushes by the canal.

249
00:21:15,672 --> 00:21:18,425
Extensive tissue damage.

250
00:21:18,634 --> 00:21:21,626
Tearing at the neck and shoulders.

251
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:28,225
- Take these.
- Wait a minute.

252
00:21:28,478 --> 00:21:33,791
No, no. You won't have to do anything.
They're just for your protection. Sit there.

253
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,419
I just need you to watch.

254
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:42,330
All right. What do we do now?

255
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:46,005
We wait for Robert Berman to wake up.

256
00:21:49,335 --> 00:21:51,326
Do you have any gum?

257
00:21:55,258 --> 00:21:57,249
No.

258
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:45,541
Buffy!

259
00:23:12,344 --> 00:23:14,335
Behind you.

260
00:23:40,918 --> 00:23:43,034
Pike.

261
00:23:43,211 --> 00:23:45,202
Ben?

262
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:53,056
Where you been, man? I tried
to call your house, like, 50 times.

263
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:56,742
<i>- I've been hanging.
- You left me hanging. I almost did a Hendrix.</i>

264
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,366
- Let me in.
- This weird guy gave me a ride home.

265
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,599
I thought he was gonna hit on me.

266
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,969
Come on. Invite me in, Pike.

267
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:07,110
Wait a minute, man. What's wrong with you?

268
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:09,995
- I'm fine.
- You look like shit, man.

269
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:12,771
Well, I feel pretty.

270
00:24:16,165 --> 00:24:19,077
- You on somethin'?
- No.

271
00:24:24,341 --> 00:24:26,491
Let me in, Pike. I'm hungry.

272
00:24:27,427 --> 00:24:30,658
- Go home, Ben.
- I'm hungry.

273
00:24:30,889 --> 00:24:33,687
You're floating.
Come on, man. Get away from here.

274
00:24:33,893 --> 00:24:38,091
I'm hungry. I'm hungry. I'm hungry!

275
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:51,435
Now, Buffy, you go to school
tomorrow and act normally.

276
00:24:51,746 --> 00:24:55,580
Don't let anyone know you know
what's happening. This is important.

277
00:24:55,834 --> 00:25:01,386
<i>Because once the vampires find out who you
are, you won't be hunting them any more.</i>

278
00:25:01,715 --> 00:25:04,468
You understand?
They mustn't know your name.

279
00:25:04,677 --> 00:25:06,474
All right.

280
00:25:06,637 --> 00:25:09,629
Meet me at this address
tomorrow after school.

281
00:25:11,852 --> 00:25:16,607
- I have cheerleading practice, OK?
- Well, you're going to have to skip it.

282
00:25:19,527 --> 00:25:23,202
They can't come in
unless you invite them in, is that true?

283
00:25:23,448 --> 00:25:26,963
- That's true. Mm-hm.
- Good.

284
00:25:36,504 --> 00:25:38,893
Do you know what time it is?

285
00:25:39,966 --> 00:25:42,844
- Around ten?
- I knew this thing was slow.

286
00:25:43,054 --> 00:25:47,445
You pay a fortune for something...
Honey, come on. We're gonna be late.

287
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,469
Wake up, sweetie. You'll be late for school.

288
00:26:58,303 --> 00:27:00,771
Are we having a nightmare, Cassandra?

289
00:27:00,974 --> 00:27:06,048
He knows you're awake. Your heartbeat
sounds out to him like thunder.

290
00:27:11,944 --> 00:27:13,741
Oh, my God.

291
00:27:18,701 --> 00:27:20,692
Who are you?

292
00:27:28,921 --> 00:27:31,833
- Oh, hi. Wow, you're late.
- I'm gonna practise.

293
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:34,279
- Cool. See you out there.
- OK. Bye.

294
00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:44,939
Oh, God! What are you doing here?
This is a naked place.

295
00:27:45,231 --> 00:27:47,984
You were supposed to meet me an hour ago.

296
00:27:49,194 --> 00:27:52,903
- I told you that I have practice.
- And I told you to skip it.

297
00:27:53,157 --> 00:27:56,513
Listen, I think there's been
a big mistake, all right?

298
00:27:56,744 --> 00:28:00,532
I appreciate there are real vampires
and you're on this big holy mission...

299
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:05,659
<i>...but obviously somebody read
their tea leaves wrong, cos I'm not your girl.</i>

300
00:28:05,962 --> 00:28:10,001
And I don't think I'm up to it. And, just
between you and me, neither do you.

301
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:12,250
It is true.

302
00:28:12,427 --> 00:28:15,624
You have missed years of training.

303
00:28:16,307 --> 00:28:18,901
- See?
- And you are undisciplined.

304
00:28:19,852 --> 00:28:21,968
- Frivolous.
- Don't I know it?

305
00:28:22,147 --> 00:28:25,662
Quite probably
the most vacuous choice in my entire...

306
00:28:25,902 --> 00:28:28,939
OK. OK, I think we both get the point.

307
00:28:29,906 --> 00:28:33,615
Right. Well, I don't think
there's anything more for us to say.

308
00:28:34,494 --> 00:28:36,485
I guess not.

309
00:28:37,414 --> 00:28:39,974
Good luck an' all.

310
00:28:44,464 --> 00:28:46,853
Oh, yes.

311
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:51,043
There is... one thing.

312
00:28:52,013 --> 00:28:54,481
- What?
- This.

313
00:28:57,019 --> 00:28:59,010
Bravo.

314
00:29:00,982 --> 00:29:04,258
- You threw a knife at my head.
- Yes. I had to show you.

315
00:29:05,487 --> 00:29:09,036
But... you threw a knife at my head.

316
00:29:09,283 --> 00:29:12,958
And you caught it.
Only the Chosen One could have caught it.

317
00:29:13,204 --> 00:29:16,082
Don't you get it?
I don't want to be the Chosen One.

318
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:19,966
I don't wanna spend the rest of my life
chasing after vampires.

319
00:29:20,212 --> 00:29:26,048
All I want to do is graduate from high school,
go to Europe, marry Christian Slater and die.

320
00:29:26,385 --> 00:29:30,856
It may not sound too exciting to
a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell.

321
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:35,691
You come and tell me I'm in the hairy-mole
club so you can throw things at me?

322
00:29:36,647 --> 00:29:38,638
Buffy, it was necessary.

323
00:29:38,815 --> 00:29:42,171
Last night you knew I was
sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?

324
00:29:42,403 --> 00:29:45,759
Yes, because I had to make
you aware of the implica...

325
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,470
Oh. Wow.

326
00:29:50,579 --> 00:29:53,218
I never hit anybody before.

327
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:56,308
Really? Well, you did it perfectly.

328
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,328
I didn't even break a nail.

329
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,714
<i># Yeah</i>

330
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:21,807
<i>- # Yeah
- # I admit you got the biggest brown eyes</i>

331
00:30:22,406 --> 00:30:26,684
<i># And you know how
to bite your lips and tantalise</i>

332
00:30:26,952 --> 00:30:29,182
<i># Sure</i>

333
00:30:29,372 --> 00:30:33,843
<i>- # Yeah
- # You can get any girl you want going</i>

334
00:30:34,127 --> 00:30:38,757
<i># How do you do it?
And don't say you don't know cos you do</i>

335
00:30:40,467 --> 00:30:44,938
<i># Well, baby, I ain't gonna
eat out my heart any more</i>

336
00:30:45,472 --> 00:30:49,511
<i># I ain't gonna eat out my heart any more</i>

337
00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:55,844
<i># I ain't gonna eat out
my heart any more, so quit it</i>

338
00:30:58,862 --> 00:31:02,855
<i># I love you, I love you, I do, boy</i>

339
00:31:03,118 --> 00:31:05,757
<i># But you ain't gonna cheat on me</i>

340
00:31:07,205 --> 00:31:10,436
<i># I need you, I need you, I do, boy</i>

341
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:13,659
<i># Chooses a tyranny</i>

342
00:31:14,755 --> 00:31:18,634
<i># Chooses it here on me</i>

343
00:31:18,885 --> 00:31:20,876
<i># Yeah</i>

344
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,672
<i># Just cos I am saying, boy</i>

345
00:31:24,892 --> 00:31:30,808
<i># You still think the same
about what I've been saying</i>

346
00:31:31,148 --> 00:31:32,581
<i># Yeah</i>

347
00:31:32,734 --> 00:31:37,091
<i># You'd better watch your step
or, boy, you're gonna lose</i>

348
00:31:37,364 --> 00:31:41,118
<i># The best thing you ever had</i>

349
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:46,909
<i># And I ain't gonna eat out my heart any more</i>

350
00:31:47,626 --> 00:31:51,301
<i># I ain't gonna eat out my heart any more</i>

351
00:31:51,838 --> 00:31:57,788
<i># I ain't gonna eat out
my heart any more, so quit it</i>

352
00:32:03,434 --> 00:32:05,504
The heart. Remember?

353
00:32:05,937 --> 00:32:08,770
So when do I meet this guy Lothos?

354
00:32:08,983 --> 00:32:14,660
I don't know. When he comes to you
in your dreams, what does he do to you?

355
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:17,299
How does he make you feel?

356
00:32:18,326 --> 00:32:21,477
He, uh... he scares me.

357
00:32:22,623 --> 00:32:28,539
Well, I think we can safely say that
there's something going on with you, Buffy.

358
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:34,583
Now, there's nothing to be nervous about.

359
00:32:34,845 --> 00:32:37,279
You're not in any kind of trouble.

360
00:32:37,473 --> 00:32:41,989
Don't think of me
as Gary Murray, administrator.

361
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:49,426
No. Think of me as Gary Murray, party guy.
Happenin' dude who can talk to the young.

362
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:52,892
<i>- So tell me, it's...</i>

363
00:32:53,115 --> 00:32:57,233
It's drugs, isn't it?
Hey, I know where you're coming from.

364
00:32:57,495 --> 00:33:00,612
Believe me, I've had my drug experiences.

365
00:33:00,832 --> 00:33:05,269
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I did a lot...
well, some acid in the '60s.

366
00:33:05,545 --> 00:33:07,536
<i>- See, I was at a...</i>

367
00:33:07,715 --> 00:33:10,149
I was at a Doobie Brothers concert.

368
00:33:10,342 --> 00:33:14,051
And I could see the music flowing in.
It was flowing into me.

369
00:33:14,305 --> 00:33:20,335
It was bright red and electric.
And I felt like I was a big toaster, you know.

370
00:33:20,687 --> 00:33:25,044
And I thought "Well, maybe
I am a toaster, and we're all molecules."

371
00:33:25,317 --> 00:33:28,832
My friend Melissa,
her head looked like a big party balloon.

372
00:33:29,072 --> 00:33:32,223
And that... Boy, that scared me! And...

373
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:38,009
And then I... I started to freak out.

374
00:33:40,501 --> 00:33:45,211
You said you'd have the part by two o'clock.
Christ, it's almost dark.

375
00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:50,361
What nasty bug crawled up your bungus?
Where the hell are you goin'?

376
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:55,225
I'm leavin', man. I'm bailin' town.
This place has gotten way too hairy.

377
00:33:55,518 --> 00:33:58,510
Where do I find a mechanic
stupid enough to work for my money?

378
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,960
- Seen Benny lately?
- No.

379
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,193
Hey. What, you want me
to give him a message?

380
00:34:06,405 --> 00:34:09,158
You should think about leaving too, man.

381
00:34:09,366 --> 00:34:14,759
Sell this place. There's something going
on here. I don't know, something real weird.

382
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,969
Hey, what do you want me
to do if I see Benny?

383
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:22,161
Run.

384
00:34:32,643 --> 00:34:34,634
Nice night for a walk.

385
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:43,612
God, it's cold.

386
00:34:43,821 --> 00:34:45,812
Dark.

387
00:34:55,585 --> 00:34:57,576
<i># Feelings</i>

388
00:34:59,714 --> 00:35:03,343
<i># Whoa, whoa, whoa, feelings</i>

389
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:08,963
<i># Boy, I'm feeling really helpless</i>

390
00:35:09,224 --> 00:35:11,215
Oh, God.

391
00:35:13,855 --> 00:35:16,164
Wait.

392
00:35:16,358 --> 00:35:18,349
Hello?

393
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,113
Toaster-caked him.

394
00:35:45,557 --> 00:35:48,390
It was a trap, get it? I led him in.

395
00:35:48,602 --> 00:35:53,881
It was a blind alley. Get it? If there'd been any
more of them, you would be dead by now.

396
00:35:54,191 --> 00:35:57,149
You must never forget
the cardinal rule, Buffy.

397
00:35:57,361 --> 00:36:01,240
One vampire is a lot easier to kill than ten.

398
00:36:01,491 --> 00:36:04,085
Does the word "duh" mean anything to you?

399
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:08,913
You felt sick, didn't you? You had cramps.

400
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,209
Nice conversationalist.
Yeah, I felt them a little.

401
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:16,899
But I'm not due for a couple of weeks,
since you're so hot on the subject.

402
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:21,490
No, of course you're not. It was
a natural reaction on the part of a slayer.

403
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:24,197
A reaction to their unnaturalness.

404
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:27,668
And you're going to be able
to use that to track them.

405
00:36:27,896 --> 00:36:33,653
Great. My secret weapon is PMS.
That's just terrific. Thanks for telling me.

406
00:36:33,986 --> 00:36:36,784
It's not a weapon. It's an alert system.

407
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:41,552
Well, aren't we kung fu! I don't see
you out there killing any vampires.

408
00:36:41,828 --> 00:36:43,819
I play my part.

409
00:36:44,706 --> 00:36:49,257
You can play with your part all you want,
but it's my neck on the block.

410
00:36:49,544 --> 00:36:51,580
I'm out there risking my life.

411
00:36:51,756 --> 00:36:55,431
I'm risking my life
and you're not doing anything.

412
00:36:57,053 --> 00:37:00,523
I train girls to be slayers.

413
00:37:01,308 --> 00:37:05,347
I have done so for a hundred lives
and I shall continue to do so.

414
00:37:06,188 --> 00:37:10,500
I am born each time with the knowledge
that my purpose is to prepare the...

415
00:37:10,776 --> 00:37:13,813
...Chosen One for her battle.

416
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:18,467
I am not a slayer,
and I must not interfere, even if I want to.

417
00:37:18,744 --> 00:37:25,456
Even if I think that this time
the girl... is truly exceptional.

418
00:37:29,797 --> 00:37:31,788
So...

419
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:39,395
What do you do? I mean, you just keep on
living the same old life over and over?

420
00:37:40,017 --> 00:37:44,852
- Yes. Yes, until...
- What? Till there aren't any more vampires?

421
00:37:45,148 --> 00:37:48,220
- Then what?
- Then maybe I'll go to heaven.

422
00:37:49,278 --> 00:37:51,428
Or maybe you'll just get ajob.

423
00:37:51,947 --> 00:37:56,099
Oh, ajob. I would have been
a wonderful boot-maker.

424
00:37:56,369 --> 00:37:59,759
That is so dull. I'm going to be a buyer.

425
00:38:00,582 --> 00:38:03,654
- Of what?
- I don't know. It's just ajob I heard of.

426
00:38:03,877 --> 00:38:05,868
Sounded pretty cool, you know.

427
00:38:08,091 --> 00:38:12,960
Buying. Buyer. To buy. I like that.

428
00:38:20,563 --> 00:38:23,202
- We should go to work.
- Yeah.

429
00:38:25,026 --> 00:38:27,745
Quick, before anybody has any fun.

430
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:33,535
Merrick, I'm not gonna croak that easily.
I have something the other girls didn't have.

431
00:38:33,827 --> 00:38:35,977
And what might that be, pray?

432
00:38:36,872 --> 00:38:38,863
My keen fashion sense.

433
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:42,006
Vampires of the world, beware.

434
00:38:42,211 --> 00:38:44,805
Merrick, you made ajoke.

435
00:38:45,006 --> 00:38:47,998
That's good. Are you all right?
Do you wanna lie down?

436
00:38:48,218 --> 00:38:50,209
I know it hurts the first time.

437
00:38:51,889 --> 00:38:53,880
It was a good joke.

438
00:38:57,979 --> 00:39:01,176
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby. Come on, be good.

439
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,391
Come on, come on, come on.

440
00:39:06,322 --> 00:39:08,313
This is not my night.

441
00:39:24,383 --> 00:39:27,773
Come on, baby. This is for the money.
Make me proud. Come on.

442
00:39:30,182 --> 00:39:32,537
Yes. All right.

443
00:39:39,692 --> 00:39:42,206
Ohhhh!

444
00:39:53,165 --> 00:39:55,838
Get off my car, dude.

445
00:40:11,602 --> 00:40:13,399
Come on.

446
00:41:17,092 --> 00:41:19,401
Give me a break.

447
00:41:19,595 --> 00:41:21,586
You ruined my new jacket.

448
00:41:22,723 --> 00:41:25,237
Kill him a lot.

449
00:41:47,334 --> 00:41:49,529
Hi. Is that your van?

450
00:41:49,712 --> 00:41:52,067
Yeah, why? Is there...

451
00:42:06,355 --> 00:42:08,471
Interesting choice.

452
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:12,165
Last-minute decision.
Sorry about your guitar.

453
00:42:12,779 --> 00:42:15,339
Hey. You're that weird guy.

454
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:21,190
- Yeah.
- You've been hurt?

455
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:25,684
Oh, no. You know what they say -
anyone who can walk away from...

456
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:30,029
- You know this guy?
- Well, somewhat.

457
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:33,806
He's rather fond of passing out
just as I happen by.

458
00:42:39,935 --> 00:42:42,733
- You doin' all right? You OK?
- Yeah, I'm good.

459
00:42:42,938 --> 00:42:45,247
I, you know, kinda miss my knees, though.

460
00:42:45,441 --> 00:42:47,671
You want some water or anything?

461
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,772
- The kitchen's in here.
- Nope. Got it covered.

462
00:43:03,585 --> 00:43:06,657
So you do this a lot?
I mean, is this like a hobby for you?

463
00:43:06,881 --> 00:43:08,872
Not exactly.

464
00:43:10,594 --> 00:43:13,267
<i>They were vampires, weren't they?</i>

465
00:43:16,183 --> 00:43:19,653
- Yeah.
- God! Vampires. Unbelievable.

466
00:43:22,273 --> 00:43:25,265
You had a car full of stuff. Were you leaving?

467
00:43:25,484 --> 00:43:29,682
Yeah, I was bailin'.
I've got this friend, and he's really...

468
00:43:29,948 --> 00:43:34,100
Well, he's really a vampire, I guess.
It's not a good scene, it's a bad scene.

469
00:43:34,369 --> 00:43:36,929
And tomorrow I'm on a bus. I'm outta here.

470
00:43:38,124 --> 00:43:40,797
- Wow. Are you OK?
- No, I'm fine.

471
00:43:41,003 --> 00:43:43,961
- You sure?
- It doesn't hurt.

472
00:43:44,548 --> 00:43:46,778
I'm OK.

473
00:43:47,426 --> 00:43:51,658
Who are you? I'm sorry,
but you seemed like such a flake.

474
00:43:51,931 --> 00:43:54,809
And I mean that in a good way, really.
It's just...

475
00:43:55,018 --> 00:43:58,806
Hey, I can keep talking until
you strike me dead, or not. I prefer not.

476
00:43:59,064 --> 00:44:02,454
- Things are kinda confusing.
- I'll buy that.

477
00:44:04,445 --> 00:44:07,357
Three weeks ago all I could think about was...

478
00:44:07,573 --> 00:44:11,885
I didn't actually think about anything.
I definitely didn't expect this.

479
00:44:12,161 --> 00:44:15,437
You know what it's like
when everything is suddenly different?

480
00:44:15,665 --> 00:44:22,377
And everything you thought
was crucial seems so stupid?

481
00:44:22,757 --> 00:44:28,627
You find yourself... babbling incoherently
to a strange man in your living room.

482
00:44:33,644 --> 00:44:36,875
Are you... calling me a man?

483
00:44:46,033 --> 00:44:48,103
Listen, I'm gonna go to bed.

484
00:44:49,411 --> 00:44:54,929
If you want to stay,
you can stay in the guest room.

485
00:44:55,251 --> 00:44:59,802
No, I'll stay right here.
Make sure the sun comes up and everything.

486
00:45:02,009 --> 00:45:04,000
OK.

487
00:45:05,555 --> 00:45:08,023
I know what it's like.

488
00:45:16,901 --> 00:45:22,134
You fool. You left the others behind
because of a little thing like this?

489
00:45:22,448 --> 00:45:24,439
On their first kill?

490
00:45:25,493 --> 00:45:27,484
He took my arm.

491
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:33,676
It's your own fault, you reckless imbecile.

492
00:45:33,961 --> 00:45:37,670
The city of angels is ours for the taking.

493
00:45:37,924 --> 00:45:44,363
But you... 1200 years old,
you behave like a child.

494
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,636
I had him in my grasp.

495
00:45:49,103 --> 00:45:52,573
Cheer up. You may still.

496
00:45:53,733 --> 00:45:56,850
And do something about that arm.
It looks horrible.

497
00:45:57,904 --> 00:46:01,613
Honestly, I don't know how
you made it through the crusades.

498
00:46:02,577 --> 00:46:04,568
I'll be in my chamber...

499
00:46:06,957 --> 00:46:08,948
...having a little snack.

500
00:46:15,633 --> 00:46:18,989
They found Cassandra's body in the hills.

501
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:21,939
I know. It had been there for weeks, all icky.

502
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:23,937
- It's awful.
- Uh-huh.

503
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,694
- She still had my jacket.
- The yellow leather?

504
00:46:26,895 --> 00:46:30,171
- You didn't get that back from her?
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

505
00:46:31,608 --> 00:46:35,487
- I loved thatjacket.
- There's a memorial service. You goin'?

506
00:46:35,738 --> 00:46:38,377
I don't know.
Coach says I gotta work on my abs.

507
00:46:38,575 --> 00:46:40,611
Oh, got to get some.

508
00:46:41,036 --> 00:46:41,991
Whoa!

509
00:46:45,958 --> 00:46:47,311
Whoa! Whoa!

510
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:50,418
I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.

511
00:46:51,339 --> 00:46:54,331
- Hey, what is it with you?
- Don't grab me, OK?

512
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:57,667
Absolutely. I see now the error of my mistake.

513
00:46:57,888 --> 00:47:01,324
Hey, keep your hand off my thang.
I'll pop you one.

514
00:47:02,059 --> 00:47:05,495
- Did he scare you?
- I can take care of myself, all right?

515
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:07,721
So I noticed.

516
00:47:07,899 --> 00:47:11,858
- Yo, Jeff.
- It's nice to feel needed.

517
00:47:12,112 --> 00:47:14,307
- Let's move out!
- Yes!

518
00:47:15,783 --> 00:47:19,981
I've missed three practices. If I'm not
at the game tomorrow, everybody will talk.

519
00:47:20,246 --> 00:47:23,079
It's just another distraction. It isn't right.

520
00:47:23,291 --> 00:47:26,681
It isn't my fate? It isn't in
the Book of All Knowledgefulness...

521
00:47:26,921 --> 00:47:30,596
...that I'll be cheering at the game tomorrow?
Lighten up, Merrick.

522
00:47:30,841 --> 00:47:33,799
None of the other girls
ever gave me this much trouble.

523
00:47:34,012 --> 00:47:36,731
<i>And where are they now? Hello?</i>

524
00:47:39,977 --> 00:47:45,256
If we all work together, together it'll all work
out! Are you with me? Now, get out there!

525
00:47:45,566 --> 00:47:47,636
All right. Score some, uh, points.

526
00:47:47,819 --> 00:47:53,052
Hey. You missed practice again today. Sit
down and think about how that made me feel.

527
00:47:55,828 --> 00:47:57,819
Go, team, go.

528
00:48:05,046 --> 00:48:06,764
<i>Ready? OK.</i>

529
00:48:06,923 --> 00:48:11,121
<i>How funky is your chicken?
How funky is your chicken?</i>

530
00:48:11,386 --> 00:48:14,822
How loose is your goose?
Our goose is totally loose

531
00:48:15,474 --> 00:48:19,228
So come on, all you Hog fans
So come on, all you Hog fans

532
00:48:19,478 --> 00:48:23,073
And shake your caboose
And shake your caboose

533
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:30,654
<i>Two, four, six, eight...</i>

534
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:34,825
Murph, come on out. You're in.
And remember, you're special.

535
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,356
Thanks. All right. Assert your personhood.

536
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:40,858
Actualise. Actualise.

537
00:48:49,596 --> 00:48:51,985
<i>More polite. More polite.</i>

538
00:48:52,182 --> 00:48:54,980
Stagger them with your politeness.

539
00:48:55,185 --> 00:48:57,699
I'm open. Grueller?

540
00:48:57,897 --> 00:48:59,888
I'm open!

541
00:49:07,783 --> 00:49:12,174
- We can't have this. Get him out.
- It is reprehensible. The points count, right?

542
00:49:12,454 --> 00:49:14,649
- Get him out.
- Yeah, OK.

543
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:21,161
Take it, man.

544
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:27,444
<i>You go get him out.</i>

545
00:49:31,475 --> 00:49:35,673
Grueller's pretty much
abandoned the concept of zones.

546
00:49:40,152 --> 00:49:42,507
There's a girl on the court.

547
00:49:51,164 --> 00:49:53,359
<i>-Buffy.
- He knows who I am.</i>

548
00:49:58,965 --> 00:50:00,717
- Got a gear...
- Hah!

549
00:50:00,883 --> 00:50:03,397
Hey, Eric. Must be half-time.

550
00:50:03,595 --> 00:50:07,031
Hey, babe. You wanna get some
real power between your legs?

551
00:50:07,265 --> 00:50:10,177
Yeah, I do.

552
00:50:10,394 --> 00:50:13,704
Dyke! You're a dyke!

553
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:16,215
I'll tell the world!

554
00:50:25,869 --> 00:50:28,144
<i>Grueller! Grueller!</i>

555
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:31,030
Come on!

556
00:50:39,802 --> 00:50:41,793
Come on.

557
00:51:27,855 --> 00:51:30,415
- Ha-ha.
- Ow.

558
00:51:31,233 --> 00:51:33,224
Someone get an ouchie?

559
00:51:33,403 --> 00:51:38,716
Grueller, it's me. Remember me? Buffy.
We used to hang. My birthday party?

560
00:51:39,034 --> 00:51:42,663
You drank all the blueberry schnapps
and louched on my mom?

561
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:47,748
- You were my friend.
- Now I'm a god.

562
00:51:54,927 --> 00:51:57,760
And now you're a coatrack.

563
00:52:00,767 --> 00:52:02,086
Geek.

564
00:52:02,227 --> 00:52:04,218
Whoa. Here we go.

565
00:52:14,448 --> 00:52:16,564
Look. There.

566
00:52:24,126 --> 00:52:27,277
- Hi.
- Hi. What are you doing here?

567
00:52:27,505 --> 00:52:30,099
What am I doing here? I'm saving your butt.

568
00:52:30,299 --> 00:52:35,373
Well, there was sort of an exchange of butts.
At least I didn't faint.

569
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,353
Pike, you shouldn't have come back.

570
00:52:39,685 --> 00:52:42,677
What am I gonna do? Run?
Where am I gonna go?

571
00:52:42,897 --> 00:52:48,210
These guys are everywhere, and I wanna
do some damage. I'm good with damage.

572
00:52:48,528 --> 00:52:51,042
I'd better find Merrick.

573
00:53:00,583 --> 00:53:03,336
I didn't expect to see you so soon.

574
00:53:07,216 --> 00:53:10,811
I know that guy.
That is a bad guy. Can we go, please?

575
00:53:11,053 --> 00:53:13,203
Has our time finally come?

576
00:53:14,014 --> 00:53:16,323
Have you ripened so fast?

577
00:53:16,517 --> 00:53:19,031
Come closer.

578
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:21,220
Look at me.

579
00:53:23,358 --> 00:53:26,395
Does anybody here have
a problem with this but me?

580
00:53:31,784 --> 00:53:34,059
Come into my eyes.

581
00:53:34,245 --> 00:53:36,679
<i>- Yes.
- Hey.</i>

582
00:53:38,834 --> 00:53:44,192
Hello? This is not a caring nurturer. He's
a bloodsucking fiend from beyond the grave.

583
00:53:44,674 --> 00:53:48,986
Will you be wagging
thatjaw of yours while I'm biting it off?

584
00:53:49,262 --> 00:53:51,253
Are you addressing I?

585
00:53:51,432 --> 00:53:53,423
<i>Who's ready to stop me?</i>

586
00:53:54,601 --> 00:53:57,035
It's not you, Merrick.

587
00:53:57,521 --> 00:54:02,595
You finally brought me someone real.
But is she ready?

588
00:54:03,111 --> 00:54:06,183
Well, actually, she's quite a pain in the ass.

589
00:54:06,406 --> 00:54:08,681
<i>- What a pity.
- Your move, Merrick.</i>

590
00:54:10,035 --> 00:54:14,825
Come on, Lefty. Remember what happened
the last time you messed with me?

591
00:54:15,124 --> 00:54:18,321
- I remember.
- Shit.

592
00:54:21,799 --> 00:54:24,108
She's not ready for you, Lothos.

593
00:54:24,634 --> 00:54:28,866
That's too bad. I had such high hopes.

594
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:31,874
Close your eyes.

595
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,761
No! Not this one.

596
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:39,493
Lothos.

597
00:54:46,618 --> 00:54:48,574
Ashes to ashes.

598
00:54:53,542 --> 00:54:56,056
Oh, look.

599
00:54:56,253 --> 00:54:58,847
Look... what I've done.

600
00:55:02,844 --> 00:55:05,312
Dust to dust.

601
00:55:05,514 --> 00:55:08,153
- We're leaving.
- We're not eating?

602
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:10,341
She's not ready.

603
00:55:13,272 --> 00:55:15,263
God.

604
00:55:16,234 --> 00:55:18,225
- Stay still.
- I am still.

605
00:55:20,196 --> 00:55:22,187
I'll get you some help.

606
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:29,093
You...

607
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:32,487
You do everything wrong.

608
00:55:36,298 --> 00:55:38,766
Sorry. I take it back.

609
00:55:38,967 --> 00:55:40,958
No.

610
00:55:41,887 --> 00:55:44,196
Do it wrong.

611
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:47,700
Don't play our game.

612
00:55:48,729 --> 00:55:54,406
Lothos is a... is a show.

613
00:55:55,277 --> 00:55:57,632
Remember about the music.

614
00:55:57,822 --> 00:55:59,813
Listen.

615
00:56:00,867 --> 00:56:06,863
When the music stops, the rest is...

616
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:13,889
Merrick? Merrick?

617
00:56:16,134 --> 00:56:18,125
Oh...

618
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:05,943
<i>It really was mondo bizarro.</i>

619
00:57:06,148 --> 00:57:11,142
When she ran out onto the court, wasn't it
the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?

620
00:57:11,445 --> 00:57:13,436
No. Way mental.

621
00:57:16,492 --> 00:57:19,290
- Oh, hi, Buffy.
- Hi, guys.

622
00:57:19,495 --> 00:57:21,884
You were supposed to be here at three.

623
00:57:22,791 --> 00:57:26,420
- Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, I forgot.
- Buffy, what is your sitch?

624
00:57:26,671 --> 00:57:30,027
You're acting like a thing from
another tax bracket. It's too weird.

625
00:57:30,258 --> 00:57:33,136
Listen, a lot's been going on, guys, OK?

626
00:57:33,344 --> 00:57:36,780
And I really wanted
to talk to you guys about it.

627
00:57:38,601 --> 00:57:43,038
See, a couple of weeks ago, I met this guy...

628
00:57:43,314 --> 00:57:45,828
Oh, my God. You're having an affair?

629
00:57:46,026 --> 00:57:48,017
- Cool.
- Does Jeffrey know?

630
00:57:49,613 --> 00:57:54,050
It's not about that. He's, like, old. He's 50.

631
00:57:54,785 --> 00:57:56,776
<i>Ew!</i>

632
00:57:56,954 --> 00:57:58,353
- Sick.
- Gross.

633
00:57:58,498 --> 00:58:03,288
Haven't you guys noticed what's been
going on here? The strange things?

634
00:58:04,129 --> 00:58:07,917
Haven't you noticed people disappearing?
Turning up dead?

635
00:58:08,175 --> 00:58:10,370
- What are you talking about?
- Weird.

636
00:58:10,552 --> 00:58:13,908
You mean, like, hanging out
with that homeless, Poke?

637
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,176
Pike.

638
00:58:17,728 --> 00:58:21,687
- Ew. You're having an affair with him?
- He doesn't look 50.

639
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:25,774
Guys, I think reality stepped
out of here about five minutes ago.

640
00:58:26,028 --> 00:58:29,020
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah. Like you've got a grip.

641
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:33,597
You're out of it. Jennifer says you've
blown off cheerleading and dance committee.

642
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:36,589
Excuse me for having
something important to do.

643
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:40,624
And this isn't important?
This happens to be the dance.

644
00:58:40,878 --> 00:58:42,709
Right. It's a dance.

645
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:47,635
It's a stupid dance with a bunch
of stupid people that I see every stupid day.

646
00:58:47,927 --> 00:58:50,043
Like, now we're, like, stupid?

647
00:58:50,222 --> 00:58:53,339
You know, Buffy,
this doesn't happen to be just any dance.

648
00:58:53,559 --> 00:58:56,995
It happens to be
the last dance of our last year.

649
00:58:57,229 --> 00:58:59,538
- Except for the semiformal.
- Right.

650
00:58:59,732 --> 00:59:02,007
- And the totally formal.
- Oh, yeah.

651
00:59:02,193 --> 00:59:04,661
- Oh, yeah. And the senior prom.
- OK!

652
00:59:04,864 --> 00:59:08,777
Buffy, if you wanna play house
with the unwashed masses, that's fine.

653
00:59:09,034 --> 00:59:13,107
But, personally, I think you should
spend a little time prioritising.

654
00:59:13,373 --> 00:59:17,207
- What language are you speaking?
- Get out of my facial.

655
00:59:21,841 --> 00:59:25,231
Well, I guess you got what you came for.

656
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:29,451
- Nic...
- Later for it.

657
00:59:31,976 --> 00:59:34,092
Jen?

658
00:59:46,785 --> 00:59:51,700
Buff! Hey, Buff. What you been doing?
I've been looking all over for you.

659
00:59:51,998 --> 00:59:54,512
I'm going shopping.
Don't try and stop me, OK?

660
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:57,065
Cool. I need Allen wrenches.
What do you need?

661
00:59:57,255 --> 00:59:59,246
- Dress.
- For what?

662
00:59:59,423 --> 01:00:01,414
- Dance.
- Come again?

663
01:00:01,593 --> 01:00:03,629
I'm going to the senior dance.

664
01:00:03,803 --> 01:00:06,397
The second word sounds like "dance".

665
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:10,751
- I'm going to the dance.
- For what?

666
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:14,296
<i>In order to dance, drink punch,
be with my friends, comprende?</i>

667
01:00:14,524 --> 01:00:20,201
No. The world is under attack by legions
of the undead and you're going to a mixer?

668
01:00:20,531 --> 01:00:24,080
It's a senior dance. It's important.
You wouldn't understand.

669
01:00:24,327 --> 01:00:27,160
No, I wouldn't.
I thought you wanted to kill vampires.

670
01:00:27,372 --> 01:00:32,287
I don't wanna kill anybody, OK?
And I don't wanna talk about this any more.

671
01:00:32,586 --> 01:00:36,499
- What about Merrick? Is that what he'd want?
- Merrick's dead.

672
01:00:36,757 --> 01:00:38,827
Cheap shot.

673
01:00:39,009 --> 01:00:43,605
He's dead because of me. Because
I couldn't lift a hand against Lothos.

674
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,881
I'm in way over my head.

675
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:49,938
Look, life's a bitch. I'll give you that.
But, Buffy, you're the guy.

676
01:00:50,189 --> 01:00:52,180
You are the chosen guy.

677
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:57,022
Right. I'm the Chosen One.
And I choose to be shopping.

678
01:00:58,072 --> 01:01:01,701
- Yeah, I should have known.
- So leave me alone, all right?

679
01:01:02,953 --> 01:01:08,266
Benny was right. You're all the same.
I'm not disappointed, just angry.

680
01:01:22,725 --> 01:01:24,716
Buffy?

681
01:01:34,363 --> 01:01:37,878
- Buffy.
- Lay out my suit.

682
01:01:38,117 --> 01:01:40,312
We will be attending a dance.

683
01:01:40,495 --> 01:01:43,692
Dance? Master, what are we waiting for?

684
01:01:43,915 --> 01:01:47,225
The Slayer is unmasked. Let's finish it.

685
01:01:47,461 --> 01:01:50,339
- We'll wait until Saturday.
- Why?

686
01:01:50,547 --> 01:01:54,745
Because I want to dance.

687
01:01:56,221 --> 01:01:58,212
I am yours to command.

688
01:02:02,227 --> 01:02:06,379
<i># Taking you to the silent city</i>

689
01:02:06,649 --> 01:02:10,437
<i># Underneath the broken stones</i>

690
01:02:10,695 --> 01:02:14,529
<i># I was hoping for eternity</i>

691
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:18,332
<i># Here among the dirt and bones</i>

692
01:02:20,831 --> 01:02:24,187
<i># Lovers hand in hand</i>

693
01:02:26,295 --> 01:02:33,485
<i># Enjoy your time together while you can</i>

694
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:13,378
Nice outfit.

695
01:03:14,266 --> 01:03:17,224
- This one doesn't have a mirror at home?
- Sh!

696
01:03:31,952 --> 01:03:35,547
- Have you seen Jeffrey?
- If I say no, are you gonna hurt me?

697
01:03:36,999 --> 01:03:39,354
- No.
- No.

698
01:03:46,468 --> 01:03:48,459
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

699
01:03:49,472 --> 01:03:55,866
Have you seen Jeffrey? Cos the limo didn't
show up, and I thought maybe he'd be here.

700
01:03:58,397 --> 01:04:00,388
What?

701
01:04:03,487 --> 01:04:06,524
- Jeffrey, there you are.
- Buffy, what are you doing here?

702
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:09,971
I thought we were gonna come here together.

703
01:04:10,202 --> 01:04:12,193
I'm here with Jenny.

704
01:04:15,876 --> 01:04:19,073
- I don't get it.
- Come on, Buffy. You know what's going on.

705
01:04:19,297 --> 01:04:21,731
It's not working out at all.

706
01:04:21,924 --> 01:04:24,518
I gotta move on. I got needs too.

707
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:30,088
- I told you about all this.
- No, you didn't.

708
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,273
- Didn't you get my message?
- You left me a message?

709
01:04:33,479 --> 01:04:35,674
You weren't home. Like always.

710
01:04:36,148 --> 01:04:39,504
- You broke up with my machine?
- I'm outta here. Jenny.

711
01:04:40,737 --> 01:04:42,728
Jenny! We're leaving!

712
01:05:01,051 --> 01:05:03,007
<i># Opened my eyes</i>

713
01:05:03,178 --> 01:05:06,648

God. Pike.

724
01:06:02,119 --> 01:06:04,235
I crashed your party.

725
01:06:04,413 --> 01:06:08,406
- How shallow of you.
- Yeah, well, I'm pretty shallow.

726
01:06:10,545 --> 01:06:12,422
I'm glad you came.

727
01:06:12,589 --> 01:06:17,868
You seemed to be having a swell time,
Queen of the Cardboard Jungle.

728
01:06:23,226 --> 01:06:26,218
Would I get my ass kicked
if I asked you to dance?

729
01:06:29,483 --> 01:06:31,474
Maybe.

730
01:06:32,819 --> 01:06:37,370
<i># Turns me inside out</i>

You know, Buffy, you're not like other girls.

733
01:06:57,806 --> 01:06:59,797
Yes, I am.

734
01:06:59,975 --> 01:07:05,254
<i># I understand the fire will come</i>

735
01:07:07,692 --> 01:07:11,128

<i># Not for the faithless ones</i>

739
01:07:39,894 --> 01:07:41,885
I can't believe it.

740
01:07:52,116 --> 01:07:54,152
Is somebody kidding?

741
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:04,782
Oh, man. There were
vampires out there, man.

742
01:08:09,261 --> 01:08:10,899
Oh, my God!

743
01:08:11,346 --> 01:08:13,337
OK. Nobody go near the door.

744
01:08:15,768 --> 01:08:18,362
Party time!

745
01:08:19,146 --> 01:08:23,139
Don't worry. They can't come in
unless they're invited.

746
01:08:23,609 --> 01:08:25,600
I already invited 'em.

747
01:08:27,656 --> 01:08:29,726
They're seniors.

748
01:08:29,908 --> 01:08:31,500
<i>Buffy!</i>

749
01:08:31,661 --> 01:08:33,936
You wanna dance?

750
01:08:34,122 --> 01:08:37,717
We want her. We want Buffy. Send her out.

751
01:08:37,959 --> 01:08:40,473
Or we'll come in.

752
01:08:40,670 --> 01:08:45,061
Hey. I have detention slips here
and I'm not afraid to use 'em.

753
01:08:47,553 --> 01:08:49,623
We got a problem.

754
01:08:51,265 --> 01:08:54,655
I got a bag full of solutions.
What are we gonna do about it?

755
01:08:54,894 --> 01:08:57,169
- You're staying here.
- What?

756
01:08:57,355 --> 01:09:00,233
If they come in here,
it's gonna turn into a total stain.

757
01:09:00,443 --> 01:09:02,559
Yeah, you say it like it's a bad thing.

758
01:09:02,736 --> 01:09:05,330
It's a good thing one of us was prepared.

759
01:09:06,323 --> 01:09:10,635
- I'm not gonna let you out there by yourself.
- Don't piss me off.

760
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:14,776
Buffy!

761
01:09:15,334 --> 01:09:17,211
Hey, Buff.

762
01:09:50,873 --> 01:09:53,671
It's OK. I think they're going after her.

763
01:10:00,342 --> 01:10:03,140
<i>- Jeffrey. Wow.
-That was quick.</i>

764
01:10:03,929 --> 01:10:05,920
Run, Buffy. Run.

765
01:10:09,894 --> 01:10:10,690
Ew!

766
01:10:15,484 --> 01:10:17,679
Look out, dude.

767
01:10:30,418 --> 01:10:32,568
Hi. How's it going?

768
01:10:34,672 --> 01:10:38,347
I'm fine. But you're obviously
having a bad-hair day.

769
01:10:39,093 --> 01:10:41,084
Funny.

770
01:11:04,455 --> 01:11:07,845
Or she could go for what's behind
door number three.

771
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,391
This party sucks, man.

772
01:11:36,324 --> 01:11:38,792
Come on, come on. Fight like a man.

773
01:11:47,128 --> 01:11:52,122
Isn't it great, Pike? Isn't it great?
Finally got those bitches on the run.

774
01:11:53,134 --> 01:11:57,332
Honestly, I leave you alone for five minutes
and look who you're hangin' out with.

775
01:11:57,597 --> 01:12:00,509
It doesn't have to be that way.
I could still change you.

776
01:12:00,726 --> 01:12:02,717
Give me a break, Benny.

777
01:12:03,772 --> 01:12:06,411
Why do you like these people? They're sheep.

778
01:12:08,985 --> 01:12:13,297
Oh, forget them. Live for ever.
We could start a band.

779
01:12:16,327 --> 01:12:22,038
I'll get you, Buffy. And your little dog, too.
I just don't know what he sees in you.

780
01:12:22,375 --> 01:12:25,924
You don't really think
you can stand up to him, do you?

781
01:12:26,171 --> 01:12:31,370
Admit it, Buffy. Aren't there times
when you just feel less than fresh?

782
01:12:35,515 --> 01:12:37,870
You're pathetic.

783
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:40,449
You're not even fit to die for him.

784
01:12:41,396 --> 01:12:43,705
We're immortal, Buffy.

785
01:12:44,399 --> 01:12:46,469
We can do anything.

786
01:12:46,652 --> 01:12:48,643
Oh, yeah? Clap.

787
01:13:16,185 --> 01:13:18,574
You're gonna wish you'd died.

788
01:13:22,859 --> 01:13:25,089
Ooh. Ah.

789
01:13:25,279 --> 01:13:27,315
Ow. Ooh.

790
01:13:27,489 --> 01:13:30,049
Ooh. Ah. Ah.

791
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:33,116
Ah. Ooh.

792
01:13:33,288 --> 01:13:35,518
Ugh. Ah.

793
01:13:38,293 --> 01:13:40,523
Ah. Uh. Uh.

794
01:13:49,806 --> 01:13:52,320
You know this is our night.

795
01:13:52,851 --> 01:13:55,365
I do.

796
01:13:56,813 --> 01:13:59,008
- It was good, wasn't it?
- What?

797
01:13:59,191 --> 01:14:03,184
Killing him. So intimate.

798
01:14:03,446 --> 01:14:08,645
Your first real kill, and my last gift to him.

799
01:14:09,954 --> 01:14:12,422
- Where is she?
- She's meat for the beast.

800
01:14:13,123 --> 01:14:16,115
The Master wants her.
And Uncle Sam wants you.

801
01:14:20,298 --> 01:14:23,370
- Things change, Ben.
- What's up with that, Pike?

802
01:14:30,476 --> 01:14:35,630
It's time to put away childish things.

803
01:14:48,371 --> 01:14:50,362
Silence.

804
01:14:55,462 --> 01:14:57,612
Look at me.

805
01:14:57,798 --> 01:15:00,995
The rest is silence. That's it.

806
01:15:01,219 --> 01:15:05,007
- What?
- Merrick told me. I knew it all along.

807
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,551
The music stopped.

808
01:15:12,356 --> 01:15:14,347
Look at me.

809
01:15:16,694 --> 01:15:20,482
- It's too late.
- You and I are one.

810
01:15:21,992 --> 01:15:25,507
One what? Cute couple? I don't think so.

811
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:30,774
You and I... Look at me.

812
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,474
You and I are joined.

813
01:15:33,671 --> 01:15:36,629
We're joined? Please!

814
01:15:37,342 --> 01:15:39,936
You stupid little bitch!

815
01:15:40,137 --> 01:15:42,093
How are you gonna stop me?

816
01:15:42,556 --> 01:15:45,912
I am life beyond death.

817
01:15:46,143 --> 01:15:50,421
And you are just like the other girls.

818
01:15:50,690 --> 01:15:52,726
Maybe I'll surprise you.

819
01:15:53,485 --> 01:15:56,443
This is your defence? Please!

820
01:15:57,114 --> 01:15:59,708
- Your puny faith?
- No.

821
01:16:00,952 --> 01:16:03,147
My keen fashion sense.

822
01:16:10,671 --> 01:16:12,662
Detention.

823
01:16:13,465 --> 01:16:18,664
Detention, detention, detention.

824
01:16:18,971 --> 01:16:24,603
Detention, detention. I think that's all of 'em.
Nope! Detention, detention.

825
01:16:24,936 --> 01:16:27,894
Hey, look. It's Buffy.

826
01:16:28,107 --> 01:16:32,498
Buffy? No, no! Don't let her in.
They'll kill us! Please keep her out!

827
01:16:41,371 --> 01:16:45,444
Buffy. I didn't think I was gonna
see you again. Are you all right?

828
01:16:47,795 --> 01:16:50,104
Get out of my way. Find my friend Pike.

829
01:16:58,933 --> 01:17:01,163
I'll have you beg.

830
01:17:01,352 --> 01:17:05,106
Split open like rotted fruit, all of you.

831
01:17:05,982 --> 01:17:08,291
That is definitely not a student.

832
01:17:11,447 --> 01:17:13,836
You are my destiny.

833
01:17:16,577 --> 01:17:18,647
I could never hurt you.

834
01:17:28,132 --> 01:17:33,252
I'm gonna send you screaming
to the pits of hell. Ha! Trust me!

835
01:17:47,862 --> 01:17:50,376
I haven't finished with you, bitch.

836
01:18:07,801 --> 01:18:09,792
I got him!

837
01:18:18,271 --> 01:18:20,580
Well, I had him.

838
01:18:24,236 --> 01:18:26,352
No, no, no, no.

839
01:18:36,792 --> 01:18:39,625
Now I'm really pissed off.

840
01:18:41,172 --> 01:18:43,561
Good!

841
01:18:45,009 --> 01:18:47,159
Oops.

842
01:19:01,736 --> 01:19:03,454
Pike?

843
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:14,234
Pike.

844
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:18,076
Oh, I used to be.

845
01:19:20,465 --> 01:19:22,456
Sorry.

846
01:19:23,969 --> 01:19:26,039
You OK?

847
01:19:26,221 --> 01:19:29,338
Yeah, I'm all right. Are you OK?

848
01:19:29,559 --> 01:19:31,629
I can't move my legs.

849
01:19:31,812 --> 01:19:34,326
- Why?
- Cos you're sitting on 'em.

850
01:19:37,943 --> 01:19:40,582
OK, come on. I'll help you up.

851
01:19:51,624 --> 01:19:53,615
Did I do all of that?

852
01:19:55,296 --> 01:19:57,287
No.

853
01:19:57,464 --> 01:19:59,500
Did you do all of that?

854
01:19:59,676 --> 01:20:01,667
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

855
01:20:12,065 --> 01:20:13,817
I, uh...

856
01:20:13,983 --> 01:20:15,974
I saved you a dance.

857
01:20:19,364 --> 01:20:21,355
You gonna ask me?

858
01:20:27,999 --> 01:20:30,274
- I suppose you wanna lead?
- No.

859
01:20:34,381 --> 01:20:36,372
Me neither.

860
01:20:38,344 --> 01:20:40,335
This is a good thing.

861
01:21:09,795 --> 01:21:13,708
<i># We close our eyes</i>

862
01:21:17,387 --> 01:21:19,537
<i># We close our eyes and dream</i>

863
01:21:20,599 --> 01:21:24,512
<i># And the world has turned around again</i>

864
01:21:31,611 --> 01:21:37,368
<i># When everybody is running in the big race</i>

865
01:21:37,701 --> 01:21:41,899
<i># And having a good time</i>

866
01:21:42,164 --> 01:21:45,713
<i># Who am I to cast a shadow?</i>

867
01:21:45,961 --> 01:21:47,599
<i># Who am I?</i>

868
01:21:47,754 --> 01:21:52,430
<i># I looked death in the face last night...</i>

869
01:21:52,718 --> 01:21:56,347
<i>... and laid siege, if you will,
to the Hemery senior dance.</i>

870
01:21:56,597 --> 01:21:59,350
<i>They had fangs, they were biting people.</i>

871
01:21:59,559 --> 01:22:03,552
<i>They had this look in their eyes.
Totally cold. Animal.</i>

872
01:22:04,857 --> 01:22:06,848
<i>I think they were Young Republicans.</i>

873
01:22:07,025 --> 01:22:11,894
<i>It was like a nightmare in there.
Of course, I had to keep my head, but...</i>

874
01:22:12,197 --> 01:22:14,427
<i>... l've been there, you know.</i>

875
01:22:14,617 --> 01:22:17,051
<i>Yeah. I saw a lot of action in Nam.</i>

876
01:22:18,621 --> 01:22:21,010
<i>Well, I saw "Platoon".</i>

877
01:22:21,834 --> 01:22:25,588
<i>I'm very happy to accept this honour...</i>

878
01:22:25,838 --> 01:22:31,071
<i>... and I will try very hard to fulfil
my needs as your next Miss America.</i>

879
01:22:31,386 --> 01:22:35,664
<i>I do think the students learned
a valuable lesson about safety.</i>

880
01:22:37,017 --> 01:22:40,896
<i>Except the dead ones,
I mean, of course. Well, they learned it.</i>

881
01:22:41,147 --> 01:22:45,698
<i>But they really didn't have time
to implement it, you know, and...</i>

882
01:22:47,445 --> 01:22:49,720
<i>Are we live?</i>

883
01:22:49,906 --> 01:22:54,218
<i>Well, I felt something was wrong,
so we really got outta there before...</i>

884
01:22:54,495 --> 01:22:58,249
<i>I mean, I heard stuff.
We were nearby. We heard...</i>

885
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:01,139
<i>I can't believe I let you do that to me.</i>

886
01:23:05,716 --> 01:23:10,551
<i>Details are still sketchy
as to exactly who is responsible.</i>

887
01:23:10,847 --> 01:23:15,284
<i>Gang members? Cultists?
Everyone seemed to see something different.</i>

888
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:18,836
<i>This is Liz Smith in Los Angeles.</i>
