00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:57,254
How far are you going, Frecken?

20
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,449
As far as Cioninborg, sir.

21
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:07,256
Do you know what was happening
to you, to me,

22
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:09,455
to all of them?

23
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:11,855
Very, very long ago?

24
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:15,609
When no one existed: neither you,
nor me, nor any of them?

25
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:17,775
What do you mean?

26
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:24,454
This happened in time immemorial,
when there'd been no stage-coaches

27
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:27,617
and only caravels
furrowed the seas.

28
00:03:27,899 --> 00:03:31,016
Have you ever heard of
the sea mermaids?

29
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:35,258
- The ones that sink the ships?
- How do you know it?

30
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:42,929
Ah, l know.
l know everything about you.

31
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:46,095
You don't believe me, do you?

32
00:03:47,499 --> 00:03:49,251
Now listen...

33
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:51,573
Far away from here,

34
00:03:53,899 --> 00:03:57,175
there's an old, old sea.

35
00:03:59,499 --> 00:04:01,854
ln that sea live the fishes and...

36
00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:10,089
Try to remember,
maybe you lived there too?

37
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:54,857
Many a day is gone,
We're sailing on.

38
00:05:55,059 --> 00:05:58,176
The blue sea taught us so
That we should share all,

39
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:01,451
A moment gay and droll,
And one common big woe.

40
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:03,172
The storm we'll overcome,

41
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:06,257
Come on, bring'ere the rum.
There's a cause for cheer and glow.

42
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,854
To make us more amused,
Tempestuous, rain-infused,

43
00:06:09,059 --> 00:06:11,015
Sea abyss is lying low.

44
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:15,451
Drink, make merry,
Fill up your glass!

45
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:20,096
Raise a toast to your dear lass!

46
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:33,458
Upon us Heaven's wrath,

47
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,253
The eyes of our betrothed
Won't see us in the harbor.

48
00:06:36,499 --> 00:06:38,694
The wind got wild and strong,
lt swept our ship along,

49
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,935
But sickness did not us trouble.

50
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:43,255
When God didn't hark,
And the beacon went dark,

51
00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:45,535
Then good fortune came to our side.

52
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,855
Bottoms up we'll drink,
To the sea bottom we'll sink,

53
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:50,095
But we'll have our dance alright.

54
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:12,250
Mothers dear, your boys here

55
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,854
Have come amiss the right mooring.

56
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,253
Dear lasses, your dresses

57
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:19,457
Not wedding will be, but mourning.

58
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:21,615
All is folly. Only ourjourney

59
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:23,775
Will be very, very long.

60
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:26,254
Let the water swirl and the trouble
crawl,

61
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:28,615
Our merriment will go strong.

62
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:06,857
Oh God Almighty!

63
00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:08,617
Mermaids!

64
00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:15,850
Man your posts!
No one is to look at the mermaids!

65
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:20,850
May they go to the sea devil!

66
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:24,017
Jesus Christ, save our souls...

67
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:16,255
Wake up!

68
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:23,335
Come on, wake up!

69
00:10:50,739 --> 00:10:54,937
Oh, God! This is Prince Antoine
de Saint-Gotharde!

70
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:59,217
Can it be that the most eligible
bachelor of Normandy is dead?

71
00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:02,253
He seems to be alive!

72
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:05,932
Grooms!

73
00:11:06,739 --> 00:11:09,936
He has already refused three
prospective brides.

74
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:14,849
Taken together, they weren't
worth even his little finger.

75
00:11:15,219 --> 00:11:19,849
He's expecting an inheritance
from his aunt, Marianne the Savage.

76
00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:24,417
l'm afraid, the inheritance is
no longer expecting him.

77
00:11:36,219 --> 00:11:39,768
You've saved my life.

78
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:18,255
Holy Mother!

79
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:23,094
- What's up?
- A mermaid!

80
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:25,608
- Go to hell!
- There's a mermaid there!

81
00:13:07,979 --> 00:13:11,528
No mermaid can sing like that.

82
00:13:11,739 --> 00:13:14,936
Could it be the Prince's voice?

83
00:13:18,739 --> 00:13:22,448
My darling stars, please help me.

84
00:13:22,659 --> 00:13:26,015
Let him know l'm waiting for him.

85
00:13:29,499 --> 00:13:31,012
My darling Prince.

86
00:13:31,219 --> 00:13:33,449
l won't move from here!

87
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:37,175
Oh, that's the Prince!

88
00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:48,095
Make way for the Knight Adalbert
Greenleaf Reynold of Marndell.

89
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:19,448
Hey, little one, come here!

90
00:14:37,819 --> 00:14:41,016
Dear wind, help me.

91
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:44,857
Go to the Prince
and tell him l'm waiting.

92
00:14:54,219 --> 00:14:58,098
And whoever said that life is
beautiful

93
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:03,771
was in some sense,
and certainly mostly right.

94
00:15:41,979 --> 00:15:43,935
Where did you come from?

95
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:47,854
Come on, say something.

96
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:53,253
Of course, you can't talk.

97
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:58,097
lf l don't see the Prince,
l'm going to die.

98
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:06,618
Swim home.

99
00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:10,334
Your daddy down at the sea bottom
must be worried,

100
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:13,013
your sisters weeping.

101
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:15,449
Do you have nannies?

102
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:20,096
Can you afford nannies at your
place? No?

103
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:27,449
And you probably have a tail...

104
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:34,617
You see? And you want your prince.

105
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:36,013
lf l don't see the Prince,
l'm going to die.

106
00:16:38,219 --> 00:16:43,247
Make way for the doctor for a prince
that was salvaged from the water.

107
00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:53,448
Your prince must be having
a bad time.

108
00:16:53,659 --> 00:16:55,854
You two need some help.

109
00:16:56,299 --> 00:16:58,096
Stay here.

110
00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:00,859
You heard me? Don't leave!

111
00:17:41,219 --> 00:17:42,857
One beer.

112
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:57,450
We put in a net at the Bald Boulder
and came up with a barrel of beer.

113
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,172
Give it back!

114
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:03,255
Where can l find a witch?

115
00:18:04,499 --> 00:18:06,455
Come on, l'm nobody's fool!

116
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:11,690
Do l look like a servant of
lnquisition?

117
00:18:11,899 --> 00:18:13,617
Calm down!

118
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:29,175
What's the matter with them?

119
00:18:29,379 --> 00:18:33,088
They all scattered
the moment the King died.

120
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:36,257
Only scatterbrains are left.

121
00:18:36,499 --> 00:18:40,094
- Pretty weird place.
- There's much more to come...

122
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:41,618
You'd be surprised. .

123
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:44,458
What do you need a witch for?

124
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:52,450
A mermaid ran away
from her parents' home.

125
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:56,618
- You don't say!
- l swear by my place in Heaven.

126
00:18:57,899 --> 00:18:59,935
And you fell madly in love with her,
didn't you?

127
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,448
Are you crazy or what?

128
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:05,696
You don't know it yet,
but soon you will know.

129
00:19:06,219 --> 00:19:09,336
Your name is Sulpitius, isn't it?

130
00:19:10,739 --> 00:19:12,855
No one knows me here.

131
00:19:14,739 --> 00:19:17,856
That's what you think,
that nobody knows you.

132
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:22,018
You just loafing about,
you good-for nothing.

133
00:19:22,219 --> 00:19:25,177
To make it short, what about a witch?

134
00:19:33,499 --> 00:19:38,095
Boy, you're lucky.

135
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:41,455
You're seeing one in front of you.

136
00:19:45,499 --> 00:19:47,933
Wait till it grows dark.

137
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:03,531
So she wants two legs and a heart
in exchange for her tail?

138
00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:09,019
- What does she need a heart for?
- To be happy.

139
00:20:09,219 --> 00:20:13,849
- Did yours bring you happiness?
- l ain't complaining.

140
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:16,855
l warn you, you'll be sorry.

141
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:21,928
She'd better stick to her sea bottom.
No, she wants a prince...

142
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:25,848
- lt will cost a lot!
- She's no pauper.

143
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:30,095
You may keep your shells.

144
00:20:30,499 --> 00:20:34,856
What pretty green hair you've got.

145
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:37,937
l wish l had such hair.

146
00:20:38,139 --> 00:20:40,528
Everyone would go green
with envy. Will you give it to me?

147
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:43,694
You are welcome.

148
00:20:45,739 --> 00:20:48,014
Say it again.

149
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:49,852
You are welcome.

150
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:55,848
And the voice!
l wish l had such a voice!

151
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:59,449
- Forget it!
- Nobody asked you!

152
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:01,854
How will she be able to talk
with the prince?

153
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:04,527
That's none of my concern.

154
00:21:04,739 --> 00:21:06,855
You'll have to make do with
the hair.

155
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:11,411
All right, l'll make do.

156
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:21,009
However, when your tail turns
into two little legs,

157
00:21:21,219 --> 00:21:24,768
it will hurt as if you were walking
on the sharp edges of swords.

158
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:28,608
- What are you talking about?
- There's no other way to do it.

159
00:21:29,899 --> 00:21:31,855
And that is not all.

160
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:36,052
Should your prince marries
another girl,

161
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:39,331
your heart is going to break
with sorrow, and you will die!

162
00:21:47,499 --> 00:21:50,252
- Well, it's your choice.
- Wait!

163
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:52,855
l agree!

164
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:56,096
Hold it!
That's not the rule.

165
00:21:56,299 --> 00:21:59,257
lf someone gives his life for her...

166
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:09,452
lf someone gives his life for you,
you will never die.

167
00:22:09,699 --> 00:22:13,658
You will be eternal like a dream!

168
00:22:16,739 --> 00:22:20,015
But there're no such fools
who would give their life.

169
00:22:20,219 --> 00:22:23,017
Go and wait for us in the inn.

170
00:23:41,499 --> 00:23:43,455
What is it? Get away!

171
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:03,857
There's a mermaid there!

172
00:24:07,139 --> 00:24:12,452
- Stop lying, Thicklipped!
- l saw her with my own eyes!

173
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:36,448
The legs came out beautiful.

174
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:45,527
What is it?

175
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:47,775
What is it beating?

176
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:50,939
That's your heart.

177
00:24:54,979 --> 00:24:56,458
Just like the Prince's.

178
00:25:10,139 --> 00:25:13,449
Go on, walk! On your toes!

179
00:25:16,499 --> 00:25:17,614
Suffer it!

180
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:24,167
That's nothing compared to the pain
your heart is going to endure.

181
00:25:26,739 --> 00:25:30,015
All the troubles come from them,
mermaids -

182
00:25:30,219 --> 00:25:33,177
hail, hunger, pestilence, Saracens!

183
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:38,015
Yesterday, they fished out
some prince from the water.

184
00:25:39,219 --> 00:25:42,097
And who has sunk the ship?
Them! The mermaids!

185
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:44,255
- How do you know?
- l know everything.

186
00:25:44,499 --> 00:25:47,457
My mother takes milk to the castle.

187
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:52,257
- Don't open!
- Keep your hands off!

188
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:02,853
Mermaid!

189
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:08,255
Go and sleep it out!

190
00:26:08,499 --> 00:26:11,457
Here's your beauty.

191
00:26:18,219 --> 00:26:20,449
Let's go, my child.

192
00:26:33,499 --> 00:26:37,174
- Does it hurt?
- No, not too much.

193
00:26:56,819 --> 00:27:02,451
At early dawn it's such a fun
To go dating with the sun,

194
00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:07,687
To sing Earth praises so wonderful
And breathe in odors of the night.

195
00:27:08,739 --> 00:27:12,448
Whoever said that life is beautiful

196
00:27:13,219 --> 00:27:17,258
Was, in a sense, mostly right.

197
00:27:45,379 --> 00:27:50,328
Take just one look at human hands.
What they create, eternally stands.

198
00:27:51,139 --> 00:27:56,167
No work for them is low or futile.
God made them not for pastime trite.

199
00:27:57,339 --> 00:28:01,014
Whoever said that life is beautiful

200
00:28:01,219 --> 00:28:04,848
Was, in a sense, mostly right.

201
00:28:33,499 --> 00:28:39,176
Much better than the guns to hear,
To drain a glassful of good beer,

202
00:28:39,379 --> 00:28:43,850
To Bacchus all remaining dutiful,
Be it a cobbler or a night.

203
00:28:44,739 --> 00:28:48,698
Whoever said that life is beautiful

204
00:28:49,499 --> 00:28:53,458
Was, in a sense, mostly right.

205
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:26,851
What will it be? A drama or a farce
That Thespians are offering to us?

206
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:32,258
But when your face unmasked and full,
Will you reveal your real sight?

207
00:29:32,739 --> 00:29:36,698
Whoever said that life is beautiful

208
00:29:37,499 --> 00:29:41,697
Was, in a sense, mostly right.

209
00:29:49,899 --> 00:29:51,855
Are we going to the Prince?

210
00:29:56,659 --> 00:29:58,172
To the Prince, right?

211
00:30:03,499 --> 00:30:06,696
Ah, Prince! This is fate!

212
00:30:08,299 --> 00:30:11,450
We were on our way from
St. Magdalene after the confession.

213
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:16,608
Suddenly l said:
''Let's go to the sea!

214
00:30:16,819 --> 00:30:20,528
''l feel that someone's soul
is parting with life there!''

215
00:30:21,739 --> 00:30:25,618
We rode up to the sea and saw
something white in the distance.

216
00:30:25,819 --> 00:30:28,936
Jacqueline said: ''lt's a seagull''.

217
00:30:29,139 --> 00:30:33,929
''Oh, no,'' l replied,
''it's a poor knight!''

218
00:30:34,139 --> 00:30:38,098
- And we plunged into the sea.
- You might have been drowned.

219
00:30:40,219 --> 00:30:43,450
My horse was drowned.
lt was snatched by a shark.

220
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:53,089
lt's so strange. l thought...

221
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:55,255
What, Prince?

222
00:30:55,499 --> 00:31:01,449
No, it was just a beautiful dream.

223
00:31:01,899 --> 00:31:07,019
- Tell us, Prince.
- Tell us about your dream.

224
00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:13,449
l hope you were dreaming of me.

225
00:31:17,899 --> 00:31:19,014
No.

226
00:31:25,379 --> 00:31:27,335
Wait for me here.

227
00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:34,608
Do not speak to anyone
and answer no questions.

228
00:31:56,499 --> 00:31:58,455
Have you been to church?

229
00:31:58,659 --> 00:32:02,447
- What is church?
- l see.

230
00:32:04,219 --> 00:32:06,175
Where did you come from?

231
00:32:06,379 --> 00:32:08,335
l promised not to tell anyone.

232
00:32:09,499 --> 00:32:12,457
- Are you a mermaid?
- Yes, l am.

233
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:14,456
You're lying!

234
00:32:18,139 --> 00:32:21,768
Hey, folks! A mermaid is here!

235
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:33,099
A tramp who claims he's
King Arthur's herald!

236
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:35,776
Speak up!

237
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:39,618
Are you the prince that has been
salvaged from the water?

238
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:44,258
l'm Prince Antoine de Lalan Poitou
Lefevre Saint-Gotharde

239
00:32:44,499 --> 00:32:47,457
who has been saved
by this noble princess!

240
00:32:51,499 --> 00:32:54,457
l need to talk to you in private.

241
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:57,617
l have no secrets from the Princess.

242
00:33:02,499 --> 00:33:05,093
l swear by St. Benedict's sandal

243
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:07,255
that l've never met such a beauty
as you

244
00:33:07,499 --> 00:33:10,252
not on the earth, nor in the inferno!

245
00:33:10,899 --> 00:33:12,855
But what King Arthur has to do
with it?

246
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:18,258
lf l came on my own,
would they have ever let me in?

247
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:21,255
l don't feel in the least offended.

248
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,773
Go away while you're in one piece.

249
00:33:25,899 --> 00:33:30,450
l came to show you something
that will shock you.

250
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:35,255
Come on, let's go and see!

251
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:38,093
Burn her up!

252
00:33:38,659 --> 00:33:41,856
Burn her! Put her on fire!

253
00:33:47,899 --> 00:33:49,855
They sink ships!

254
00:33:55,139 --> 00:33:58,609
Good people! We've caught
a mermaid!

255
00:33:59,899 --> 00:34:03,858
- You sank the Prince's ship?
- Together with my sisters.

256
00:34:04,899 --> 00:34:06,935
Mermaid! Put her to fire!

257
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:18,858
Keep your hands off!
Don't dare touch her!

258
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:21,095
She is a mermaid.
She said so herself.

259
00:34:21,379 --> 00:34:22,778
Stop it!

260
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:32,851
The King of the Sea is ordering you!

261
00:34:35,059 --> 00:34:38,256
Harken and tremble!

262
00:34:39,979 --> 00:34:43,176
Didn't you recognize the king?

263
00:34:49,059 --> 00:34:50,617
Didn't you?

264
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:56,254
We're traveling actors!

265
00:34:59,899 --> 00:35:02,538
And she's my daughter.

266
00:35:03,819 --> 00:35:06,856
How many ships have we sunk?

267
00:35:07,059 --> 00:35:08,174
Want me to count?

268
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:26,251
Let's go, daughter.

269
00:35:27,899 --> 00:35:29,014
Dunderheads!

270
00:35:29,659 --> 00:35:35,848
He's been fooling you!
l saw her in the water!

271
00:35:36,499 --> 00:35:37,693
Burn her!

272
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:40,448
They bring pestilence!

273
00:35:41,299 --> 00:35:43,255
Keep away!

274
00:35:46,499 --> 00:35:49,457
- They sink ships!
- Bring on pestilence!

275
00:36:08,979 --> 00:36:13,336
Prince, you can't allow
that heavenly creature

276
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:15,854
to be killed in your presence!

277
00:36:27,499 --> 00:36:31,458
What creature? This one?

278
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:42,255
Ladies and gentlemen!

279
00:36:43,499 --> 00:36:47,617
You see before you the noble prince
that was fished out of the water.

280
00:36:49,219 --> 00:36:53,690
He is going to tell you
if she's a mermaid or...

281
00:36:55,739 --> 00:36:57,695
Tell them, Prince.

282
00:37:03,299 --> 00:37:06,018
Sweet child,
l won't let anyone hurt you.

283
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:18,095
Ladies and gentlemen!

284
00:37:18,499 --> 00:37:20,455
She's not a mermaid.

285
00:37:23,059 --> 00:37:25,778
Didn't l say so?
That's right, she's not a mermaid!

286
00:37:25,979 --> 00:37:28,539
We just hurt the poor girl.

287
00:37:30,899 --> 00:37:34,858
You're ready to believe
any nonsense!

288
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:37,175
Let's put her to test by fire!

289
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:41,257
First you'll have to test
my sword!

290
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:48,176
- They'll tear her to pieces!
- Oh no, come on.

291
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:52,687
Noble knights!
Why did you draw your swords?

292
00:37:54,899 --> 00:37:56,252
Because of me!

293
00:37:57,659 --> 00:37:59,854
- Who are you?
- A mermaid.

294
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:04,450
That's not true. She doesn't
understand what she's saying.

295
00:38:05,059 --> 00:38:09,018
Mermaids have fish tails, don't they?

296
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:12,448
Throw her in the dungeon!

297
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:14,615
Take heed, Princess!

298
00:38:15,299 --> 00:38:20,453
And who are you? Are you with her?
Throw him in the dungeon too!

299
00:38:25,259 --> 00:38:28,092
l'm the sword-bearer of the noble
prince

300
00:38:28,299 --> 00:38:30,938
that has been fished out
of the water.

301
00:38:33,899 --> 00:38:38,450
- l like his nerve!
- l like it too.

302
00:38:46,899 --> 00:38:52,451
Since l was 15, l've been looking
for a girl deserving to live for!

303
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:59,448
l beg you, live up
to my expectations!

304
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:22,691
The gallant knight Adalbert
Greenleaf Reynold of Marndell!

305
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:33,095
The news of your beauty
has reached Marndell.

306
00:39:50,499 --> 00:39:54,174
l've got seven castles
and 120 vassals,

307
00:39:54,379 --> 00:39:58,452
three thousand barrels of wine
and 120 thousand sheep.

308
00:39:58,659 --> 00:40:00,695
l offer you my hand and heart!

309
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:04,257
Noble knight,
you're very gracious.

310
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:13,094
Tomorrow we'll hold a tournament!

311
00:40:15,139 --> 00:40:19,098
The winner will get my hand.

312
00:40:32,419 --> 00:40:37,174
lf someone asks you,
say you're the Princess of Zaduan.

313
00:40:38,979 --> 00:40:41,777
This is not true, l can't say it.

314
00:40:47,219 --> 00:40:50,529
- Can you keep a secret?
- Yes.

315
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:52,855
The Princess is praying for you.

316
00:40:53,899 --> 00:40:58,450
She is sure you will win and God
will unite you two in wedlock.

317
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:25,449
Can you keep a secret?

318
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:28,934
The Princess is sure you will win.

319
00:41:31,499 --> 00:41:33,774
The Lord will unite you.

320
00:41:45,979 --> 00:41:49,016
Tell the Princess
that she is a noble lady.

321
00:41:57,899 --> 00:42:00,857
She's a very distinguished lady!

322
00:42:08,739 --> 00:42:12,937
Really? l could have guessed it!

323
00:42:13,899 --> 00:42:18,256
Of course, she's not a mermaid.
She just has some secret!

324
00:42:18,979 --> 00:42:21,447
- And where's she?
- ln the tower.

325
00:42:21,659 --> 00:42:24,173
- Why in the tower?
- But you yourself...

326
00:42:25,739 --> 00:42:27,695
Why is she not here, at the ball?

327
00:42:45,299 --> 00:42:49,008
lt's so romantic
to keep one's name secret!

328
00:42:49,219 --> 00:42:51,938
She's a victim of the cruel fate!

329
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:56,098
She's the daughter of Duke of
Norfolk,

330
00:42:56,299 --> 00:42:58,859
who had to elope with her knight.

331
00:42:59,059 --> 00:43:01,857
- And where's the knight?
- He must have been killed.

332
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:11,858
But pray,
don't ask her any questions.

333
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:15,847
Yes, she swore on the cross
to keep her secret!

334
00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:18,015
Oh, we'll never do that!

335
00:43:20,299 --> 00:43:26,852
A noble lady...
shrouded in mystery.

336
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:32,174
Come here, my dear.

337
00:43:58,379 --> 00:44:01,849
Your secret is sacred for us.

338
00:44:02,059 --> 00:44:05,017
We'll never ask you
a single question.

339
00:44:42,819 --> 00:44:47,529
- The Princess is so beautiful!
- She saved my life.

340
00:46:23,139 --> 00:46:26,529
Tell me, my child, where did you
learn to dance so well?

341
00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:30,609
l wish l could dance as well.

342
00:46:32,139 --> 00:46:34,095
l'm bored with my ladies-in-waiting.

343
00:46:35,139 --> 00:46:37,699
They always lie to me.

344
00:46:39,739 --> 00:46:44,096
Tell me, for instance,
am l very beautiful?

345
00:46:46,379 --> 00:46:48,097
Yes, very beautiful!

346
00:46:48,299 --> 00:46:52,178
You're such a darling! l'm not
going to ever part with you!

347
00:47:04,299 --> 00:47:07,609
l'm Witch! Com'ere, my toads
and snakes!

348
00:47:07,819 --> 00:47:11,016
All people are stupid to talk of
just love.

349
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:14,529
To cook evil poison forever it takes.

350
00:47:14,739 --> 00:47:18,095
l laughed at the people throughout
my life.

351
00:47:18,819 --> 00:47:22,255
But something went wrong
with the moon and the sea,

352
00:47:22,499 --> 00:47:26,014
With stars in the sky, or maybe
with me.

353
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:29,689
l'm tired of witchcraft. That's it.
That's enough!

354
00:47:29,899 --> 00:47:31,855
l want to be one who's dying
of love.

355
00:47:33,899 --> 00:47:36,857
l'm Witch! Do you hear, you river
females?

356
00:47:37,059 --> 00:47:40,256
You all are just women, just
foolish naiads.

357
00:47:40,499 --> 00:47:44,253
You can only think of your
glittering scales,

358
00:47:44,499 --> 00:47:47,457
Of falling in love, and your
sweethearts' tirades.

359
00:48:05,139 --> 00:48:11,851
The Duchess Alice-Margaret
Elizabeth of Cornwall!

360
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:14,254
On her way to Rome!

361
00:48:37,219 --> 00:48:41,007
l can imagine, dear Duchess,
how tired you must be!

362
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:42,538
Not a bit!

363
00:48:57,819 --> 00:48:59,775
Shall we dance?

364
00:49:01,659 --> 00:49:04,253
With you? l don't feel like it.

365
00:49:06,059 --> 00:49:08,527
Your fish tail must be hindering
you.

366
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:12,173
She's my guest.

367
00:49:38,299 --> 00:49:40,608
l'll teach you some manners, knight!

368
00:50:07,899 --> 00:50:12,768
Gallant knights!
Let's not spoil the ball.

369
00:50:14,499 --> 00:50:17,252
Tomorrow you'll meet each other
at the tournament!

370
00:50:17,979 --> 00:50:21,938
They're justjoking.
You'll get used to it soon.

371
00:50:25,499 --> 00:50:29,094
My dear,
you think l'm the ideal woman.

372
00:50:30,979 --> 00:50:34,449
Actually, l'm a nasty, evil,
envious, gossiping brat.

373
00:50:34,659 --> 00:50:37,093
Believe me, l'm the worst gossiper.

374
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:44,768
And something else. l laugh, dance,
make men go crazy about me,

375
00:50:44,979 --> 00:50:47,937
but really l'm being tormented.

376
00:50:52,499 --> 00:50:56,538
ls it possible that a man
is predestined

377
00:50:56,739 --> 00:50:59,697
only for one person?

378
00:50:59,899 --> 00:51:02,459
There're so many people
in the world...

379
00:51:05,659 --> 00:51:07,536
The Prince loves you!

380
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:12,174
l don't know. Everybody waits
for a prince, like in fairy tales.

381
00:51:18,139 --> 00:51:22,018
One day you'll tell me
your secret,

382
00:51:23,499 --> 00:51:26,252
and l'll arrange
a special tournament for you.

383
00:51:28,139 --> 00:51:29,857
Wise man!

384
00:51:32,059 --> 00:51:34,015
What have l done!

385
00:51:35,979 --> 00:51:40,450
lf the Prince is killed during
the tournament, she's going to die!

386
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:45,538
lf the Prince wins
and marries the Princess,

387
00:51:49,059 --> 00:51:50,856
she's going to die anyway...

388
00:51:51,659 --> 00:51:54,253
All right, l'll help you.

389
00:51:55,139 --> 00:52:00,532
l'll give the mermaid some of
my philter, and she'll be yours.

390
00:52:00,739 --> 00:52:03,094
Are you crazy?

391
00:52:03,299 --> 00:52:06,530
She's in love with the Prince.
Don't you dare!

392
00:52:07,379 --> 00:52:08,528
Go to hell then!

393
00:53:02,659 --> 00:53:04,251
With this lance,

394
00:53:04,499 --> 00:53:08,253
the Duke of Navarre
skewered three Saracens.

395
00:53:10,139 --> 00:53:11,618
Thank you.

396
00:53:13,219 --> 00:53:15,608
l wish it broke right now.

397
00:53:15,819 --> 00:53:18,777
Are you mad? What are you
talking about?

398
00:53:21,299 --> 00:53:23,255
lt's you who went mad!

399
00:53:23,499 --> 00:53:27,697
Such stupidity
is simply unimaginable!

400
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:32,256
You forget yourself.
Who are you talking to?

401
00:53:32,499 --> 00:53:37,698
To the prince who's willing
to marry a coquette.

402
00:53:37,899 --> 00:53:40,857
She doesn't care a bit whom she's
going to marry.

403
00:53:41,659 --> 00:53:46,449
But you're blind. All your life
you've been looking for a girl who...

404
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:49,696
And she's not this girl, Prince.

405
00:53:49,899 --> 00:53:51,855
l could just cut you in two pieces!

406
00:53:52,899 --> 00:53:54,855
Whatever stops me?

407
00:53:55,059 --> 00:53:58,449
The very last drops of reason
stop you, my friend.

408
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:03,857
Don't you understand that
there's only one princess...

409
00:54:04,739 --> 00:54:08,778
The princess of princesses.

410
00:54:10,899 --> 00:54:13,094
The daughter of the king...
Well, what's the use?..

411
00:54:13,299 --> 00:54:14,937
Are you drunk?

412
00:54:15,139 --> 00:54:17,528
You were holding her hand.

413
00:54:17,739 --> 00:54:19,775
You danced with her.

414
00:54:20,739 --> 00:54:23,253
lf l were in your place,

415
00:54:25,059 --> 00:54:28,449
l would have fought for her.

416
00:54:28,659 --> 00:54:32,095
Your place is to go and groom
my horse!

417
00:55:51,739 --> 00:55:54,458
l feel l'm going to die soon.

418
00:55:56,139 --> 00:55:58,448
l can talk only to you now.

419
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,332
When l'm gone,

420
00:56:03,739 --> 00:56:08,255
tell the Princess that l thought
about her all the time.

421
00:56:08,499 --> 00:56:10,251
Tell the Princess...

422
00:56:10,979 --> 00:56:13,095
lt's time, Prince.

423
00:56:14,299 --> 00:56:18,258
lf l have to die seven times
just to be with her for one moment,

424
00:56:18,499 --> 00:56:21,457
l'm ready to face death
seven times!

425
00:56:43,979 --> 00:56:49,451
Wait! lt's notjust a game!
lt means death!

426
00:56:49,659 --> 00:56:52,457
They are going to kill each other!

427
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:55,127
Why are you laughing?

428
00:57:37,499 --> 00:57:40,616
The 13th century we live in
is very cruel, my dear.

429
00:57:42,499 --> 00:57:44,455
A feat of chivalry

430
00:57:44,659 --> 00:57:46,615
is the most valuable thing on earth.

431
00:57:47,899 --> 00:57:51,448
A man may die,
but his fame would live forever!

432
00:57:52,299 --> 00:57:55,848
Cross your spears, bold knights,

433
00:57:56,059 --> 00:57:58,698
for the most beautiful eyes

434
00:57:58,899 --> 00:58:01,254
are watching your feats!

435
00:58:08,979 --> 00:58:10,458
The noble knight

436
00:58:10,659 --> 00:58:15,096
Prince Antoine de Lalan Poitou
Lefevre Saint-Gotharde

437
00:58:15,299 --> 00:58:18,416
challenges the knight

438
00:58:18,659 --> 00:58:23,096
Greenleaf Reynold of Marndell!

439
00:58:30,299 --> 00:58:35,009
The gallant knight Adalbert
Greenleaf accepts the challenge!

440
00:58:41,739 --> 00:58:44,173
Don't be afraid, my dear!

441
00:58:47,979 --> 00:58:49,617
Who is to win?

442
00:58:53,299 --> 00:58:54,698
Get him under the saddle!

443
00:58:59,499 --> 00:59:00,932
Pierce him with the spear!

444
00:59:04,899 --> 00:59:07,015
Hew him! Right through his heart!

445
00:59:31,219 --> 00:59:35,451
What a lovely dress!
ls that velvet from Venice?

446
00:59:36,659 --> 00:59:41,255
No, l've got it from...

447
00:59:44,659 --> 00:59:46,695
l wish l had
such an angelic voice.

448
01:00:38,099 --> 01:00:39,327
Oh, God!

449
01:00:39,579 --> 01:00:42,457
Why the two cameos?
What does it mean, Princess?

450
01:00:51,659 --> 01:00:53,854
What a treacherous stroke!

451
01:01:05,899 --> 01:01:07,332
Good for him!

452
01:01:07,579 --> 01:01:10,013
Another stroke, and he'll be king!

453
01:01:10,739 --> 01:01:13,697
l'm asking for your hand,
Princess!

454
01:01:14,299 --> 01:01:17,257
You hoped to win my hand
with your base stroke?

455
01:01:51,299 --> 01:01:53,255
We'll have to hold another
tournament.

456
01:01:53,499 --> 01:01:59,608
Let's send the footmen
on a three-month walk again.

457
01:01:59,819 --> 01:02:03,448
And the troubadours will have
to be dispatched too.

458
01:02:03,659 --> 01:02:07,095
The whole world must know
about the pride of our Princess,

459
01:02:08,139 --> 01:02:11,927
who has rejected the winner
for his unworthy stroke.

460
01:02:12,139 --> 01:02:14,448
Leave alone your lute!

461
01:02:17,059 --> 01:02:20,335
Another tournament!
lt will take ages just to arrange it!

462
01:02:28,139 --> 01:02:32,098
lf l revive the Prince,
he will rise and run to his Princess.

463
01:02:32,299 --> 01:02:33,254
That's for him to decide.

464
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:38,334
And you keep on fussing about.
You'd better think of yourself.

465
01:02:38,579 --> 01:02:41,855
Who, me?
You poor, poor witch!

466
01:02:42,059 --> 01:02:45,449
lt's not for you to feel joy
seeing joy in someone else's eyes.

467
01:02:47,979 --> 01:02:50,777
Well? Do you want me
to revive your prince?

468
01:02:56,499 --> 01:03:01,095
But don't forget:
you'll lose him forever!

469
01:03:02,299 --> 01:03:03,778
Yes, l agree!

470
01:03:15,659 --> 01:03:18,093
Well, let's have your pretty eyes
covered.

471
01:04:12,299 --> 01:04:14,255
Hey, you, get up!

472
01:04:35,659 --> 01:04:37,251
What happened to me?

473
01:05:09,499 --> 01:05:14,857
Prince Antoine de Lalan Poitou
Lefevre Saint-Gotharde!

474
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:19,252
Oh, Jesus Christ, our Lord!

475
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:22,457
Holy Magdalene,
the patroness of our castle!

476
01:05:22,659 --> 01:05:26,857
Thank you
for hearing my prayer.

477
01:05:31,659 --> 01:05:35,095
Do you know
that l've been on my knees

478
01:05:35,299 --> 01:05:37,938
since l returned from the stadium,
and only now rose to my feet?

479
01:05:46,819 --> 01:05:49,174
Yes, l lied about everything!

480
01:05:49,379 --> 01:05:51,939
No, l didn't pray, nor there
had been any God's angels.

481
01:05:54,139 --> 01:05:56,937
And l gave my cameo to each
of you just in case.

482
01:06:01,139 --> 01:06:02,094
Antoine!

483
01:06:23,499 --> 01:06:28,619
But she saved my life.
And my duty of chivalry...

484
01:07:38,499 --> 01:07:40,171
Are you leaving?

485
01:07:42,219 --> 01:07:46,849
Do you know that as soon
as the Prince marries the Princess

486
01:07:48,219 --> 01:07:50,255
the Little Mermaid will die?

487
01:07:51,499 --> 01:07:55,253
Yes, l know. l know everything.

488
01:07:55,499 --> 01:07:59,617
- Did you say goodbye to her?
- What for?

489
01:08:01,499 --> 01:08:04,696
l have my hands full even
without her.

490
01:08:05,819 --> 01:08:10,335
- Where are you going?
- Well, the world is...

491
01:08:10,819 --> 01:08:15,847
Lamplighters, mirror-cutters
and showmen

492
01:08:18,139 --> 01:08:20,334
are always in demand.

493
01:08:24,579 --> 01:08:26,695
Do you have any regrets?

494
01:08:29,059 --> 01:08:30,458
No regrets.

495
01:08:33,579 --> 01:08:35,535
Rejoice!

496
01:10:56,659 --> 01:10:58,695
Hey, you, good-for-nothings!

497
01:10:58,939 --> 01:11:00,850
Just look at her!

498
01:11:01,059 --> 01:11:03,448
She's going to die today!

499
01:11:04,139 --> 01:11:08,052
- Stop insulting us!
- Mind your own business!

500
01:11:09,939 --> 01:11:14,455
ls there anyone ready
to give his life to save her?

501
01:11:15,059 --> 01:11:18,017
There're no fools here!

502
01:11:26,819 --> 01:11:31,449
We'll marry you off
to the most gallant knight!

503
01:11:31,659 --> 01:11:35,937
Tailors! Make twelve dresses
for her right away!

504
01:11:36,139 --> 01:11:40,018
She must be dressed better
than anyone...

505
01:11:44,139 --> 01:11:45,333
except me.

506
01:11:45,579 --> 01:11:47,012
Tailors!

507
01:12:16,659 --> 01:12:21,096
What are you so happy about?
You will die today.

508
01:12:24,979 --> 01:12:26,253
And you have no regrets?

509
01:13:22,979 --> 01:13:24,458
Who are you?

510
01:13:24,659 --> 01:13:27,696
l'm Prince Antoine de Lalan
Poitou Lefevre Saint-Gotharde!

511
01:13:27,899 --> 01:13:29,855
And he's an impostor!

512
01:14:12,979 --> 01:14:15,539
You? Why?

513
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:18,937
Come closer, Prince!

514
01:14:20,979 --> 01:14:23,174
You've been looking for your dream.

515
01:14:24,899 --> 01:14:28,858
And you have overlooked it.
lt is the Little Mermaid!

516
01:14:30,819 --> 01:14:32,013
The moment l die

517
01:14:32,219 --> 01:14:35,689
you will lose her for good.

518
01:14:36,499 --> 01:14:39,252
She will live on earth forever.

519
01:14:39,619 --> 01:14:42,577
But you will never see her again.

520
01:14:44,579 --> 01:14:48,538
All my life l was a failure,

521
01:14:49,539 --> 01:14:54,169
but l didn't fail at death.

522
01:15:13,499 --> 01:15:16,457
Antoine, who are you looking for?

523
01:16:49,739 --> 01:16:54,859
Since then the Little Mermaid
has been wandering around the earth,

524
01:16:56,299 --> 01:17:01,771
bringing happiness to everyone
who happened to see her.

525
01:17:29,179 --> 01:17:32,694
The End
