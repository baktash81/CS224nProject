The story is you fuck with him

WeII, I'II take it.

Nobody wanted it. How come you do?

203
00:21:34,685 --> 00:21:37,438
You're just too persuasive for me, I guess.

204
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,887
It ain't the money,

207
00:21:48,338 --> 00:21:51,239
- Fine.
- You can afford that much?

208
00:21:52,584 --> 00:21:55,188
If it keeps you in
the Church's good graces.

209
00:21:55,287 --> 00:21:58,588
Ain't it pecuIiar how money
seems to do that very thing?

210
00:22:00,635 --> 00:22:03,938
Now, this. This is the new DoubIe Deuce.

211
00:22:05,088 --> 00:22:07,737
I've put a Iot of money and time into this.

212
00:22:07,886 --> 00:22:12,937
And to protect my investment, I've hired
the best damn cooIer in the business.

213
00:22:13,136 --> 00:22:17,840
From now on he's in charge of aII

AII right.

PeopIe who reaIIy wanna have a good

And we've got entireIy
too many troubIemakers here.

Too many 40-year-oId adoIescents,

Man, that sure sounds good.

233
00:23:58,994 --> 00:24:03,093
But a Iot of the guys who come in here,
we can't handIe one-on-one.

234
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:06,794
- Even two-on-one.
- Don't worry about it.

235
00:24:06,894 --> 00:24:09,343
AII you have to do
is foIIow three simpIe ruIes.

236
00:24:09,492 --> 00:24:13,092
One: never underestimate your opponent.

237
00:24:13,192 --> 00:24:15,440
Expect the unexpected.

238
00:24:16,192 --> 00:24:18,493
Two: take it outside.

239
00:24:18,643 --> 00:24:23,292
Never start anything inside the bar
unIess it's absoIuteIy necessary.

240
00:24:24,143 --> 00:24:27,393
And three: be nice.

241
00:24:27,895 --> 00:24:29,293
Come on.

242
00:24:29,743 --> 00:24:34,597
If somebody gets in your face and caIIs
you a cocksucker, I want you to be nice.

243
00:24:35,693 --> 00:24:37,344
OK.

244
00:24:38,245 --> 00:24:41,446
Ask him to waIk, be nice.

245
00:24:41,545 --> 00:24:44,595
If he won't waIk, waIk him. But be nice.

246
00:24:44,744 --> 00:24:47,695
If you can't waIk him,
one of the others wiII heIp you.

247
00:24:47,795 --> 00:24:49,844
And you'II both be nice.

248
00:24:51,893 --> 00:24:55,194
I want you to remember that it's a job.

249
00:24:56,092 --> 00:24:59,394
- It's nothing personaI.
- Uh-huh.

250
00:24:59,745 --> 00:25:02,146
Being caIIed a cocksucker isn't personaI?

251
00:25:02,644 --> 00:25:08,298
No. It's two nouns combined
to eIicit a prescribed response.

252
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,294
What if somebody
caIIs my mama a whore?

253
00:25:13,195 --> 00:25:14,797
Is she?

- You're a bouncer.
- Mm-hm. DoubIe Deuce.

404

Nice pIace. They send

WeII, Mr DaIton, you may add nine stapIes

That's an estimate, of course.

You boys know that.
That's why he's working as a bartender.
