Another?

146
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:54,310
The naming of cats

147
00:08:54,312 --> 00:08:57,045
is a difficult matter.

148
00:08:57,047 --> 00:09:01,016
It isn't just
one of your holiday games.

149
00:09:01,018 --> 00:09:05,087
You may think at first
I'm as mad as a hatter

150
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:09,292
when I tell you a cat must
have three different names.

151
00:09:09,294 --> 00:09:10,527
First of all,

152
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:12,462
there's the name
that the family use daily,

153
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:13,530
such as...

154
00:09:13,532 --> 00:09:15,331
- Peter.
- Augustus.

155
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,534
- Alonzo.
- Or James.

156
00:09:17,536 --> 00:09:21,504
But I tell you a cat needs
a name that's particular.

157
00:09:21,506 --> 00:09:25,341
A name that's peculiar
and more dignified.

158
00:09:25,343 --> 00:09:27,176
CHORUS (in unison):
Else how can he keep up

159
00:09:27,178 --> 00:09:29,279
his tail perpendicular?

160
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:31,213
Or spread out his whiskers?

161
00:09:31,215 --> 00:09:33,148
Or cherish his pride?

162
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,083
But above and beyond,

163
00:09:35,085 --> 00:09:37,387
there's still
one name left over.

164
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:40,222
And that is the name
that you never will guess.

165
00:09:40,224 --> 00:09:44,327
The name that no human research
can discover,

166
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:48,263
but the cat herself knows
and will never confess.

167
00:09:48,265 --> 00:09:52,502
When you notice a cat
in profound meditation,

168
00:09:52,504 --> 00:09:55,805
the reason, I tell you,
is always the same.

169
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:57,507
Her mind is engaged

170
00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:01,210
in a rapt contemplation
of the thought,

171
00:10:01,212 --> 00:10:04,514
of the thought, of the thought

172
00:10:04,516 --> 00:10:06,449
of her name.

173
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:08,551
