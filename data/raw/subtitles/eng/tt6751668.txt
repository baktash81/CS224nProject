1
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,664
We're screwed.

2
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,837
No more free wi-fi.

3
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,506
- Hey, Ki-jung!
- Yeah?

4
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,799
The lady upstairs put
a password on 'iptime'.

5
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,971
A password?

6
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,765
Did you try 123456789?

7
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:45,971
No luck.

8
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,475
Do it the other way.

9
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,148
I tried that too!

10
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:53,232
Fuck, then we can't get WhatsApp?

11
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:54,688
Nothing.

12
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,860
Hey, Kim Ki-taek.

13
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:01,118
Don't fucking pretend to sleep.
What do you think?

14
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:07,455
Our phones are shut off.
Now our wifi is shut off.

15
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,082
What's your plan?

16
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,132
- Ki-woo.
- Yes, Dad?

17
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,757
For wifi, hold it high.

18
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:23,926
Stick it in every corner and so on.

19
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:31,520
Damn stink bugs.

20
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,606
Over here! I got it!

21
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,028
Really? You got a signal?

22
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,855
Yeah, see?

23
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,571
This one, 'coffeeland 2G'.

24
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,698
Did a new cafe open?

25
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,495
Why can't I get it?

26
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,163
Climb up here.

27
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,535
Hey kids.

28
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,993
- Does it work?
- Yeah.

29
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,420
Then check WhatsApp.

30
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,415
Pizza Generation said they'd contact me.

31
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,170
Hold on.

32
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,969
Here it is. Pizza Generation.

33
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:06,301
Wow! Check this out, guys.

34
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:10,313
If we go as fast as her,
we can finish today.

35
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,685
Then we can get paid.

36
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:14,893
- Should we stand up too?
- She's a pro.

37
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,108
What? Fumigation?

38
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,566
They still do that kind of thing?

39
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,660
Guess so.

40
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:23,536
Shut the window.

41
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,029
Leave it open.
We'll get free extermination.

42
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,705
Kill the stink bugs.

43
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,454
Right, too many stink bugs
these days...

44
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,875
God, that smells!

45
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,341
I told you to shut it!

46
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,381
Should I shut it, Dad?

47
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,315
What exactly is the problem?

48
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,936
Take this one as an example.

49
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,446
You call this a straight line?

50
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,656
And why's it folded here?

51
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,609
Why is this sticking up?

52
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,119
You didn't even fold it.

53
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:12,291
A quarter of them look like this.

54
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,869
So 1 out of 4 are rejects.

55
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,793
So you're really docking
10% off our pay?

56
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,713
Considering the rejects,
that's a low penalty, isn't it?

57
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:30,351
Our pay is so low already!
How can you do this?

58
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,179
Look here.

59
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,856
This is not some minor issue.

60
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:41,192
You know what one shitty box
can do to our brand image?

61
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,733
Brand? You can't even afford
a box folder!

62
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,237
What did you say?

63
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,445
Boss.

64
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,600
This is all because
of that guy, right?

65
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,624
What guy?

66
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,372
Your part-time worker.
He's gone AWOL, right?

67
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:59,581
Just when the Love of God Church
made a huge group order?

68
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,924
How do you know all that?

69
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,626
Who told you?

70
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,711
My sister knows the guy.

71
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:10,175
He's always been a bit strange.
Got a bad reputation.

72
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,306
Speaking of which, Boss.

73
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,104
We'll accept a 10% penalty.

74
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,226
In return...

75
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,397
In return?

76
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,268
Any thought of hiring
a new part-time worker?

77
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,817
Sis, we need someone!

78
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:27,359
Ditch the guy you've got now.
Just fire him.

79
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:31,367
Tomorrow I'll come for
a formal interview. What time?

80
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,947
Wait, hold on a sec.

81
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,083
Let me think about it.

82
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,503
Then for now,
just pay for the boxes.

83
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:49,631
So we're all gathered here today,

84
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,722
to celebrate the reconnection
of our phones,

85
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:57,476
and this bounteous wi-fi!

86
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,809
Look at that bastard.
It's not even dark yet.

87
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,359
Why didn't you put up
a 'No Urinating' sign?

88
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,407
I told you!

89
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:10,778
No, signs like that
just make them piss even more.

90
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,953
At least shout at him!

91
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,530
Don't shout.

92
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,581
"Please don't piss!"

93
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,371
Hey, is that Min?

94
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,169
Hey mister, that's not a toilet.

95
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,625
Way to go, Min.

96
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,756
Hey, punk!

97
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:31,010
Who are you staring at, asshole?

98
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:34,430
Come here! You little shit.

99
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,388
Get a fucking grip!

100
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,895
That's an impressive friend.

101
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,853
College students have
a real vigor to them.

102
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,113
Not like my brother.

103
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:49,531
But is he coming here?
Did you invite him?

104
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:50,699
No.

105
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:51,908
Hello!

106
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,531
Oh hi, Min!

107
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:54,872
Min!

108
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:55,748
Are you well, sir?

109
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,287
- Sure.
- What are you doing here?

110
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,242
I texted you. Didn't you see it?

111
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:01,748
Sorry, were you eating?

112
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,124
No, we weren't eating.

113
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,501
- How are you, Ki-jung?
- Fine, you too?

114
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,300
We could've met outside,
why come here?

115
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,261
Because of this.

116
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,050
It's for you,
but it's so heavy.

117
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,515
Really? Put it down here.

118
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,060
Wow, what is that?

119
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,762
When I said I was meeting Ki-woo,

120
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:23,315
my grandfather insisted
I bring this to you.

121
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,613
Is this a landscape type?

122
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,779
Or you can see it
as an abstract type.

123
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,531
Wow, you know these!

124
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:38,615
My grandpa has collected scholar's rocks
since his cadet days.

125
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:42,285
Now the annex, the study,
every room in the house

126
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,336
is filled with these things.

127
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:48,420
But this stone here is said
to bring material wealth to families...

128
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,751
Min!

129
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,879
This is so metaphorical.

130
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:56,390
For sure.
It's a very opportune gift.

131
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,351
Of course.

132
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:01,346
Please relay our deepest
thanks to your grandpa.

133
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,393
Food would be better.

134
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,574
What was that called?
A landscape stone?

135
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,116
You collect those rocks too?

136
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:22,951
Hey, thanks to that rock
I saw your parents, they look healthy.

137
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:28,047
They're plenty healthy,
just out of work.

138
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,752
Is Ki-jung taking lessons
these days?

139
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,760
She can't afford lessons.

140
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,107
Cute, huh?

141
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,444
She's the one you're tutoring?

142
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,689
Park Da-hye.
High school sophomore.

143
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:56,280
You take over
as her English tutor.

144
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,867
What do you mean?

145
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,071
Tutor a rich kid.
It pays well.

146
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,539
She's a nice girl.

147
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,584
Look after her while
I'm studying abroad.

148
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:09,755
What about your university friends?

149
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,209
Why ask a loser like me?

150
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,253
Why do you think?

151
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,051
Just the thought makes me sick.

152
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:22,389
Those disgusting frat boys
slavering over Da-hye?

153
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,220
It's revolting.

154
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,397
You like her?

155
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,610
Hey, I'm serious.

156
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:43,956
When she enters university,
I'll officially ask her out.

157
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,458
So you take care of
her until then.

158
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:50,208
If it's you,
I can leave in peace.

159
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,793
Thanks for your trust,

160
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,463
but do I have to pretend to be
a college student?

161
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,221
Ki-woo, think about it.

162
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:07,396
For years including
your military service,

163
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,648
you took the university entrance
exam 4 times.

164
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,902
Grammar, vocabulary,
composition, conversation...

165
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,104
When it comes to English,

166
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:19,659
you can teach 10 times better than
those drunken college pricks.

167
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,412
- I guess so.
- Sure!

168
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,409
But will they hire me?
I'm not a college student.

169
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,126
Just fake it.

170
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:32,922
Don't worry, you'll have
my recommendation, plus...

171
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,421
How should I describe the mother...?

172
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,424
She's a bit simple.

173
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,759
Young and simple.

174
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,057
Simple?

175
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,891
What do you mean?

176
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:48,933
Anyway, it's all good.
I had fun there.

177
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,856
So you agree?

178
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,399
I guess so.

179
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:57,439
Hey, you said
your sister is artistic?

180
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,398
Good at Photoshop?

181
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:06,121
God, with skills like this,
why can't you get into art school?

182
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,539
Shut up.

183
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,245
Hey, no smoking in here.

184
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,704
Yeah, yeah. Gimme that.

185
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:14,914
Yeah.

186
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,925
Now the cherry on top...

187
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:27,969
Wow, does Oxford have
a major in document forgery?

188
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:31,514
Ki-jung would be top of her class.

189
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,229
She's amazing, huh?

190
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:39,860
Our boy's going for a job interview.
Wish him luck.

191
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,649
Son.

192
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,320
I'm proud of you.

193
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,779
Dad.

194
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,658
I don't think of this
as forgery or crime.

195
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,001
I'll go to this university
next year.

196
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:56,455
So you've got a plan!

197
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,338
I just printed out the document
a bit early.

198
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,371
<i>Who is it?</i>

199
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,624
Madame? Good afternoon.

200
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,546
I'm here on Min's recommendation...

201
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,377
<i>Oh right, come in.</i>

202
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,047
Thank you.

203
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:18,879
Hello!

204
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,131
Hello, Madame.

205
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,794
I just work here.
Come this way.

206
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,837
The yard is so nice.

207
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,593
The inside's nice too.

208
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,301
You know the architect Namgoong?
He's famous.

209
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,016
He used to live in this house.

210
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,433
He designed it himself.

211
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,400
As you can see,
now it's a playpen.

212
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,110
This way.

213
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,739
Sit yourself down here.
I'll bring the madame.

214
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,040
Yes.

215
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,341
<i>Madame.</i>

216
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:10,548
<i>Madame?</i>

217
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,385
Madame?

218
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,638
Madame?

219
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,485
He's here.
The tutoring candidate.

220
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,442
I don't care about documents.

221
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,407
Min recommended you, after all.

222
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:39,160
As you know, Min is such
a brilliant human being.

223
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:42,083
Da-hye and I were quite happy
with him.

224
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,465
Regardless of her grades.
Know what I mean?

225
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,754
Yes.

226
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,965
He was marvelous.

227
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:56,053
So to be honest, we wanted to stick
with him through high school.

228
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,681
But all of a sudden
he's going abroad.

229
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:07,526
Anyway, excuse me,
but if I can speak directly,

230
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:12,618
if you're not up
to Min's level, then,

231
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,161
I'm not sure
what the point is.

232
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,705
So anyway,
what I want to say is,

233
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:26,336
for your first lesson today,
do you mind if I sit in?

234
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,378
I want to see it full time,
how you run your lesson.

235
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,594
Is it okay with you?

236
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,999
You sure about #24?

237
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:17,220
Da-hye, you solved those later problems
then went back to #24.

238
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,884
Right?

239
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,762
Yes.

240
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:34,450
If that were the first question
on a real exam, you'd be screwed.

241
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,784
Look at this.
Your pulse is racing.

242
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,915
The heart doesn't lie.

243
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:49,422
An exam is like slashing through
a jungle.

244
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:52,084
Lose that momentum
and you're finished.

245
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,845
The answer to #24?
I don't care.

246
00:16:55,056 --> 00:17:00,142
Slashing through the exam,
dominating it!

247
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,435
That's all I care about.

248
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:07,103
What you need is vigor.

249
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:09,818
Vigor.

250
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,438
Understand?

251
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,285
So I'll pay you
this time each month.

252
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:29,668
3 classes a week,
2 hours each, okay?

253
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,499
As for the fee,

254
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:35,461
I was going to pay Min's rate,
then I added a bit for inflation.

255
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,841
Thank you.

256
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,390
How about a proper introduction?

257
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,514
Da-hye's tutor,
we'll call him Kevin.

258
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,725
Mr. Kevin!

259
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:49,391
If you feel like snacking
during your lesson, just call me.

260
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,897
If you need anything, ask her.

261
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,526
She knows this house better than I...

262
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,775
Da-song, stop it!

263
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,951
I'm sorry, did he startle you?

264
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,529
How cute. His name's Da-song?

265
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,364
Yes, our youngest.

266
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,166
Da-song, come say hi!

267
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,788
This is Mr. Kevin!

268
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:14,667
This is an Indian arrow.
I ordered it from the U.S.

269
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,503
From last year he's been
an Indian fanatic.

270
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,926
Indians?

271
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,347
He's got a fanboy personality?

272
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,184
Well, he's eccentric
and easily distracted,

273
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,561
he can barely sit still!

274
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:33,189
So last year I enrolled him
in Cub Scouts,

275
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,272
hoping he'd learn moderation
and focus.

276
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,776
But look.

277
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,112
He's even worse.

278
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:47,533
His scout leader is an Indian fanatic,
maybe that's why.

279
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,462
The American Indian is
the very spirit of the Cub Scouts.

280
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,584
It's a good thing.

281
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,633
Were you a Cub Scout, Kevin?

282
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,795
Sure, I'm a Scout by nature.

283
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:04,182
Da-song is an artist by nature.
Look at this painting.

284
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:08,020
It's so metaphorical.
It's really strong.

285
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:09,813
Strong, right?

286
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,019
You've got an eye for this.

287
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,109
It's a chimpanzee, right?

288
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:16,653
A self-portrait.

289
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,278
Sure enough!

290
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,863
The perspective of
a young artist eludes understanding.

291
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,327
Or perhaps it's Da-song's
expressive genius...

292
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:33,795
Anyway, we've been through
so many art teachers.

293
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,339
None of them lasts even a month.

294
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,927
And Da-song is just so hard
to control.

295
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,932
- Just a moment, Madame.
- Yes?

296
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:49,561
Someone just came to mind.

297
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:51,813
What was her name?

298
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,812
Jessica! Right, Jessica...

299
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:59,237
She was in the same art school
as my cousin.

300
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,899
What was her Korean name?

301
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:07,325
Anyway, after studying applied arts
at Illinois State University,

302
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,372
she returned to Korea.

303
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,575
Illinois... tell me more.

304
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:17,961
Her teaching is unusual,
but she knows how to handle kids.

305
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,464
She's got a special reputation
in her field.

306
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,259
But even though
her methods are unique,

307
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,886
she can help kids get
into good art schools.

308
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:31,016
Now I'm really curious.
What is she like?

309
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:32,854
Would you like to meet her?

310
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:36,233
Though I heard she's
in high demand...

311
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,691
Hold on.

312
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,741
Jessica, only child,
Illinois Chicago,

313
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,699
classmate Kim Jin-mo,
he's your cousin.

314
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:02,881
Look at how he painted the side
dishes on the tablecloth

315
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,379
in this mosaic arrangement.

316
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,306
But within that too,
there are repeating patterns.

317
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:11,560
Gochujang is red, the rice...
well, anyway,

318
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:16,561
he has a Basquiat-esque sense,
even at age 9!

319
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,483
How exciting.

320
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:23,864
I'm sure Miss Jessica
must have already sensed this,

321
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:28,072
so I'll leave you two,
and go up for Da-hye's lesson.

322
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,328
Have a nice lesson, Jessica.

323
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,330
Yes, thank you for the introduction.

324
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:41,749
So as you can see,
Da-song's eccentric genius...

325
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:45,719
Da-hye.

326
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:49,093
So we'll start with #38?

327
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:54,932
Kevin.

328
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,225
Yeah?

329
00:21:56,398 --> 00:22:01,314
Did you know that Da-song is
faking it all?

330
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:04,146
Huh? What do you mean?

331
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,068
It's all a show.

332
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:10,027
Acting like a genius,
that 4th dimension stuff is all fake.

333
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,827
An artist cosplay.

334
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,530
Da-song?

335
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,374
You know that thing,

336
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,579
when he freezes and stares at the sky,
as if struck by inspiration.

337
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:26,798
So he's walking along, then he stares
at the clouds for 10 minutes.

338
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,178
So you know what I mean?

339
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,882
He gives me the creeps.

340
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,177
He pretends that he can't live
a normal life.

341
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,270
Makes me want to puke.

342
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,394
So Da-song is pretending...

343
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:44,895
But what's that got to do
with your studies?

344
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:52,862
Well, I'm just saying.

345
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,453
Sure, so in that sense,

346
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:02,671
what you told me
about Da-song was very interesting,

347
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,039
so let's write about it
in English.

348
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:11,304
And be sure to use the word 'pretend'
at least twice.

349
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:15,012
Then, can I ask you a question?

350
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,218
Sure.

351
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,804
That teacher Jessica.

352
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:25,562
Is she really your cousin's classmate?

353
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,280
What do you mean?

354
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,650
She's your girlfriend, right?

355
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:38,787
No way... I just met her today.

356
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,956
Jessica's really pretty,
isn't she?

357
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:48,546
Aren't you interested?

358
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,302
You saw her?

359
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:55,970
Sure, she's pretty.
She's a beautiful woman.

360
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,308
Yeah.

361
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,097
I knew it.

362
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,940
So you are interested.

363
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:09,070
Da-hye...

364
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:18,456
So, if we can compare Jessica
to a rose,

365
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,031
then you are...

366
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,583
- Let's study.
- Yes.

367
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:12,885
Please understand that
my boy has trouble keeping still.

368
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,336
I understand.

369
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:15,963
Da-song!

370
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,182
Da-song, get up!

371
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,765
Come on, Da-song!

372
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,684
In your butt...

373
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,183
- Madame, please leave us.
- What?

374
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,307
I never teach with a parent
in the room.

375
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:29,981
But today is our first day,
and as you can see, he's...

376
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,777
Wait downstairs.

377
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,526
Park Da-song?

378
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,732
Da-song!

379
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:40,988
Madame?

380
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,623
Want some plum extract?

381
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:44,745
What?

382
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:48,036
It's mixed with honey.
To ease your tension.

383
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,084
Yeah, that would be great.

384
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:06,888
- Hey.
- Yes?

385
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,640
I've got an idea.

386
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:11,898
Take two glasses of plum
extract to Da-song's room.

387
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:15,147
You're not a parent,
so you can go in!

388
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,731
Oh, that's right!

389
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,951
Then I'll report back on
what's going on in there...

390
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,328
Why didn't I think of it earlier?

391
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:25,949
What?

392
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,451
They came out?

393
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:28,961
Yeah.

394
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:34,382
So you're done already?

395
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,044
Madame.

396
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,678
Come sit next to me.

397
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,470
Da-song, go upstairs.

398
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,636
Hurry up!

399
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,110
Da-song just painted this.

400
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,404
I see...

401
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,533
I'd rather speak with Madame alone.

402
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:01,989
Oh, but she is...

403
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,662
No, leave us.

404
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,460
Madame,

405
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:15,291
I told you I study art psychology
and art therapy?

406
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:16,670
Yes.

407
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,927
Did anything happen to Da-song
in first grade?

408
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,890
To be frank,

409
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,553
before I decide whether
to take on Da-song,

410
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,105
I need to hear about this.

411
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:35,527
But this is hard for me
to talk about right now.

412
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,654
What to do?

413
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,021
Never mind, then.

414
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:43,744
The lower-right region of a painting is
called the 'schizophrenia zone'.

415
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,321
Psychotic symptoms
often reveal themselves here.

416
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:47,415
Oh, phrenia...

417
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,457
Look here.

418
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,867
Da-song painted this unusual shape,
right?

419
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,377
I see.

420
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:57,332
Over there, it's the same!
It's the same, right?

421
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:59,292
Yes, that's correct.

422
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,213
A similar shape in the same zone.
You see it now?

423
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,631
Yes.

424
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:09,307
I've stared at that painting
at every meal!

425
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,722
But I had no idea.

426
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:14,733
Calm down.
Let's compose ourselves.

427
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:18,482
This is all a black box
into Da-song's mind.

428
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:22,490
Would you like to
open that box with me, Madame?

429
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:25,068
I want to open it.

430
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:29,702
Then we'll need 4 two-hour sessions
per week,

431
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:34,001
and this is not simple tutoring,
it's art therapy, right?

432
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,087
Of course.

433
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:38,836
Because of that my rate is
set at a very high level.

434
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:40,676
Are you okay with that?

435
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,085
It's my pleasure.

436
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,342
Da-song's dad is home.

437
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:56,228
Honey, Da-song's new art teacher
is here.

438
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:00,862
Her name's Jessica,
from Illinois.

439
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,648
<i>Jessica! This is Dong-ik.</i>

440
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,491
- Hello.
- Hi.

441
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,318
Thanks for your help.

442
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:08,653
Class is over?

443
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:09,954
Yes, just finished.

444
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:11,664
- Driver Yoon.
- Yes?

445
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,286
- Are you free?
- Yes, I am.

446
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:15,790
Then give her a lift, okay?

447
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:20,549
Sure, we don't want her
going down alone at night, right?

448
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:21,750
Of course.

449
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:23,335
Miss Jessica?

450
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:29,386
Shall I drive you
all the way home, then?

451
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,890
- Which neighborhood?
- No, that's fine.

452
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,564
You can just drop me off
at Hyehwa station.

453
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,900
Thank you.

454
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,392
I don't mind if it's far away.

455
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:43,196
- My shift is finished, anyway.
- I'll get off at Hyehwa.

456
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:46,695
Looks like it's going to rain.

457
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,911
Ride the Benz, not the subway!

458
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:54,287
I'm meeting my boyfriend
at exit 3 of Hyehwa Station!

459
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:56,997
Yes.

460
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:35,536
Dad, when you worked as a driver,
did you drive a lot of Benzes?

461
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,666
Benzes?

462
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:42,421
Not then, but I did
when I worked as a valet.

463
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:45,716
You worked as a valet?

464
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:49,591
Sure, after the chicken place went bust,
before the Taiwan cake shop,

465
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,422
in that 6-month window?

466
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,884
No, it was after the cake shop
went bust.

467
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,935
We're moving
to the next stage already?

468
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:04,193
I set a trap in the Benz.

469
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,066
Then we're diving right in.

470
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,322
Wow, this is so metaphorical.

471
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:12,452
Look Dad, we're eating in
a driver's cafeteria right now!

472
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,783
Right, a driver's cafeteria!

473
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,160
Eat as much as you want, kids.

474
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:20,077
You didn't even pay for it,
they did!

475
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:23,417
Son, have some more.
Eat up!

476
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:24,465
Yes, Dad.

477
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:25,582
Eat your fill!

478
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,792
What did you do
to that woman yesterday?

479
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:28,761
What?

480
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:30,344
She was freaking out.

481
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:32,506
Saying she was so moved,
you put her in shock.

482
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:34,265
Fuck, I don't know!

483
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:38,220
I googled 'art therapy',
and ad-libbed the rest.

484
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,722
Then suddenly she's weeping.

485
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,224
Crazy bitch,
I couldn't believe it.

486
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,010
Oh, you're home?

487
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,678
Did you eat yet?

488
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,140
Is something wrong?

489
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:25,566
Is the housekeeper out?

490
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,484
She's walking the dogs.

491
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,482
Honey.

492
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:32,615
This was under my car seat.

493
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,370
Driver Yoon is such a scumbag.

494
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,118
What is this?

495
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,332
I'm sorry, honey.

496
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,542
I didn't know
he was this kind of guy.

497
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,287
Don't you pay him well?

498
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:50,045
Is he saving up by not paying
for a motel?

499
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,921
He must be a pervert.

500
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:53,298
He likes it in the car.

501
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:57,348
Oh, that's gross.
In his boss' car!

502
00:32:57,434 --> 00:33:01,553
A young guy's sex life is
his own business, that's all fine.

503
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,017
But why in my car?

504
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:13,114
And if so, why not in his seat?
Why cross the line like that?

505
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,566
You're right.

506
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:18,111
Does dripping his sperm
on my seat turn him on?

507
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:20,200
I can't believe this.

508
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:28,671
But you know
what's strangest of all?

509
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:30,923
What?

510
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:34,339
Usually if you have car sex,

511
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:39,508
you might leave behind
a strand of hair, or an earring.

512
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:40,849
Right.

513
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,478
But how can you forget
your own panties?

514
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:48,895
That's right.
It's hard to overlook.

515
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:54,022
So it makes me quite suspicious
of this woman's condition.

516
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,858
You get me?

517
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,035
<i>Oh my</i>... meth or cocaine?

518
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,495
Shh! The kids...

519
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,414
What do we do?

520
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:14,418
What if anyone finds white powder
in your car?

521
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,673
Calm down, relax.

522
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,637
Relax

523
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:22,429
For now it's just supposition.
A rational guess.

524
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,140
But no need to call the police.

525
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,766
Not that!

526
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:32,982
Still, for a busy man like me to ask,
"Why are you fucking in my car?"

527
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,562
Exactly.

528
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:36,488
So instead...

529
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:41,286
Can you just invent some bland
excuse to let him go?

530
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,991
Okay sure.

531
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:46,161
No need to mention panties
or car sex.

532
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,618
We don't need to stoop
to that level, do we?

533
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,419
Surely not!

534
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:54,211
But what if he goes online
and accuses us...

535
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:56,384
Just give him a good severance.

536
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:59,796
How was Da-song today?

537
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,802
He was fine.

538
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,850
- So class is finished?
- Yes.

539
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,599
Jessica, the last time you came,

540
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:10,102
our driver gave you a ride,
right?

541
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,151
That's right.

542
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:13,234
This may be an odd question,

543
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,485
but nothing happened then?

544
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,029
No, he was very nice.

545
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,902
I told him
to go to Hyehwa Station,

546
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:22,281
but he insisted
on driving me home.

547
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,454
That jerk!
He took you home late at night?

548
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,406
Revealing where you live?

549
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,451
No, I got off at Hyehwa.

550
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,878
Oh, good girl. Very good.

551
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:34,584
Jessica nice...

552
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,083
Did something happen with him?

553
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:42,430
He won't be working for us anymore.
A slightly shameful incident.

554
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,549
What incident?

555
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:47,226
Oh, you don't need to know.

556
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:52,724
But I'm surprised.
He was so gentlemanly and cool.

557
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:56,185
Jessica, you're too young
and innocent!

558
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,316
You have a lot to learn
about people.

559
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:03,993
But we were excited to have such
a young, hip driver, too.

560
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,243
But isn't an older driver better?

561
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:11,201
That's true. They drive better,
have better manners.

562
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:14,078
My father's brother had
a driver just like that.

563
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:18,758
Mr. Kim.
He was so congenial and nice,

564
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,586
I used to call him Uncle
when I was young.

565
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,337
You know a man like that?

566
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,139
Yes, he was so mild-mannered.

567
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:31,558
Oh, but my relatives relocated
to Chicago.

568
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:35,016
I wonder if Mr.
Kim's free now?

569
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:39,107
I'm really interested!
Could I meet him?

570
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,313
Really?

571
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:42,694
I don't trust anyone now.

572
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,114
I only trust someone recommended
by a person I know well.

573
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:51,074
But if you've known him so long,
I'd feel much more at ease.

574
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,202
Do you really want to meet him?

575
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,754
I'm deadly serious.

576
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:01,505
This chain of recommendations
is best.

577
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,461
How should I describe it?

578
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,137
A belt of trust?

579
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,592
- This one's different.
- Here.

580
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:07,349
Oh, right.

581
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,716
And this one.

582
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:10,684
Looks like a touch screen now.

583
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,353
It's not touch,
it says you have to turn it.

584
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,477
Wow, this thing?

585
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:17,187
Sir?

586
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:19,360
Taking our time, are we?

587
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,031
This is a nice car.

588
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,236
This is it!
Come over here.

589
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,662
He's in a meeting now.

590
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,247
Have a seat and wait here.

591
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,468
Hello, nice to meet...

592
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,226
But is it compatible
with a phone?

593
00:37:57,317 --> 00:38:03,655
Oh, not with a phone.
You need more computing power.

594
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:09,489
This isn't any sort of test,
so don't be nervous.

595
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:13,823
I was worn out at the office,
so I came out for a bit.

596
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,165
I understand.

597
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:19,830
Constant chatter, all that bother.
At least the car is peaceful.

598
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,586
Thank you.

599
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,793
You seem to know the roads well?

600
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:29,051
Anything below the 38th parallel.

601
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:32,641
After 30 years behind the wheel,
the car almost drives itself.

602
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,595
I respect those who work
in one field for a long time.

603
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,688
Well, to be honest,
this is a simple vocation.

604
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:41,893
But... the head of a household,

605
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:44,232
the leader of a company?

606
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:49,109
Or else just a lonely man setting off
on the road each morning...

607
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,865
It's companionship of a sort,

608
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:55,039
so that's how I've approached each day.

609
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,374
The years sure pass quickly.

610
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,331
Sure enough,
your cornering is excellent.

611
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:10,130
Well, it may look simple,
but it's one of the fundamentals.

612
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:15,097
<i>She may look like a sheep,
but inside, she's a fox.</i>

613
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,388
<i>Sometimes she acts like
she owns the house.</i>

614
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,023
<i>Right.</i>

615
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:24,481
<i>Of all the people in that house,
she's lived there the longest.</i>

616
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:28,189
<i>She was housekeeper
to the architect Namgoong,</i>

617
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:32,698
<i>but then she went on to work
for this family.</i>

618
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,949
<i>When the architect moved out,</i>

619
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,907
<i>he introduced this woman
to Park's family,</i>

620
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:41,376
<i>telling them, "This is a great housekeeper,
you should hire her."</i>

621
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:44,796
<i>So she survived
a change of ownership.</i>

622
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:47,876
She won't give up
a good job easily.

623
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:51,675
To extract a woman like that,
we need to prepare well.

624
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:55,599
Right, we need a plan.

625
00:39:56,769 --> 00:40:00,012
I want to eat peaches.
I like peaches best.

626
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:02,018
Why not ask for some?

627
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:05,601
No peaches at our house.
It's forbidden fruit.

628
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,370
<i>So according to
what Da-hye told me,</i>

629
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:20,783
<i>she's got a massively serious
allergy to peaches.</i>

630
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:24,245
<i>You know that fuzz
on a peach's skin?</i>

631
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:28,215
<i>If she's anywhere near it,
she gets a full body rash,</i>

632
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:32,045
<i>has trouble breathing, asthma,
a total meltdown!</i>

633
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:40,640
No no, there weren't
any peaches anywhere.

634
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,773
That's what I'm saying!

635
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:47,606
Usually when I get symptoms
like this,

636
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:50,988
I run to my room
and take my medicine,

637
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:56,661
but it was so sudden,
I wasn't sure where I left it.

638
00:40:56,829 --> 00:41:01,620
Madame, this woman behind me,
is that...?

639
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,708
Oh, it's our housekeeper!

640
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:06,128
So it's true. Oh, how sad.

641
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:09,339
I wasn't sure
if that was really her.

642
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:13,427
I've only seen her a couple times
in the living room.

643
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,970
This was in the hospital?

644
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:19,846
A few days ago I went
for my annual medical exam.

645
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:24,563
I took a selfie for my wife,
and there she was behind me.

646
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:27,191
Is she talking
on the phone there?

647
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:30,360
Anyway. I wasn't trying
to eavesdrop...

648
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,312
I wasn't trying
to eavesdrop,

649
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,239
but her words
came through clearly!

650
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,112
- So I couldn't help but...!
- Cut, cut!

651
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:39,161
Dad, your emotions are up
to here.

652
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:41,489
Bring them down to
about there.

653
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:44,499
...so I couldn't help
but overhear.

654
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,872
Keep it focused!

655
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,123
What I'm trying to say is,
it's just that,

656
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:55,257
your housekeeper's voice
is quite loud, you know?

657
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:59,131
I understand, it's all right.
Just tell me, okay?

658
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,093
She said she got diagnosed
with active TB,

659
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,143
and she was shouting
on the phone,

660
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,314
so upset she could
barely control herself!

661
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,767
Tuberculosis?
Come on...

662
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:15,027
It's true, she phoned someone
saying she had active TB.

663
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:20,077
Do people still get TB?

664
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,580
Dad...

665
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:26,792
Back in the day, people used
to buy Christmas Seals, right?

666
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:28,335
Feels like a bygone era.

667
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:29,878
But I saw it on the internet.

668
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:33,924
Korea has the #1 rate of TB
of all the OECD countries.

669
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,629
But she's still working,
as if nothing's wrong.

670
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,634
With a kid like Da-song
in the house.

671
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:42,808
So you've got a young kid
like Da-song in the house,

672
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:46,220
and a TB patient is doing dishes,
cooking, spraying spittle...

673
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:47,600
Stop it, please!

674
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:53,894
<i>Dad: Arriving in 3 mins</i>

675
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:44,574
If you get the chance,
this'll be icing on the cake.

676
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:16,568
<i>Madame</i>

677
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,441
<i>2nd floor sauna room</i>

678
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:19,738
<i>Don't let her see you</i>

679
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:31,909
- Have a seat.
- Yes.

680
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,916
Mr. Kim.

681
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:38,966
Please don't tell any of this
to my husband, okay?

682
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:40,213
Understood.

683
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:44,673
If he hears I brought
a TB patient to our home,

684
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:47,884
I'll be hanged and quartered!

685
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:49,559
Don't worry, Madame.

686
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:53,351
And if I may presume
to say one thing.

687
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:56,813
I have no feelings
against that woman.

688
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:04,361
I felt I had to speak up for the sake
of public health and hygiene.

689
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:08,533
But this could be
seen as snitching or...

690
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:09,989
Don't you worry.

691
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,665
I won't mention the TB.

692
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:15,165
I'll just make up some excuse
to dismiss her.

693
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:17,037
Simply and quietly.

694
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:21,129
It's a proven method.
That's the best.

695
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:22,801
Okay, then.

696
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:36,891
Have you... washed your hands?

697
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:26,865
Mr. Kim, do you know
a good braised ribs place?

698
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:28,487
Somewhere close by.

699
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:29,944
Sure.

700
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,868
- Then you'll be eating out?
- That's right.

701
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,243
Why such a craving
for braised ribs today?

702
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:40,705
Our old housekeeper made delicious ribs.

703
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,466
The one who quit this week?

704
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:48,887
My wife wouldn't even tell me
why she quit.

705
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:56,645
Sure, it's easy enough
to hire a new one.

706
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:02,643
Still, it's a shame.
She was a great housekeeper.

707
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:03,737
I see.

708
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,362
She kept the house
in great shape,

709
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:09,066
and she knew never
to cross the line.

710
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,323
I can't stand people
who cross the line.

711
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,576
Perhaps just one weak point?

712
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:17,874
Eating too much.

713
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:20,494
She always ate enough for two.

714
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:25,336
But considering all the work
she did...

715
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:30,800
Then you better find someone new.
A new housekeeper.

716
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:32,930
We're in trouble now.

717
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:37,429
In a week, our house will be
a trash can.

718
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:41,057
My clothes will start
to smell.

719
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,360
My wife has no talent for housework.

720
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:48,780
She's bad at cleaning,
and her cooking's awful.

721
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,817
Still, you love her, right?

722
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:02,586
Of course. I love her.

723
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:05,543
We'll call it love.

724
00:48:07,343 --> 00:48:09,255
Then would this help?

725
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,674
The Care?
What is this?

726
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:18,218
I just recently found out
about them.

727
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:23,019
How to describe it?
It's like a membership service.

728
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:30,231
The company provides veteran-grade
help to VIP customers such as you.

729
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:36,405
For example maids, caregivers,
or drivers like myself.

730
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:39,456
You can tell from the card
they're high-class.

731
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,658
Cool design.

732
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,877
Then how do you know
about this company?

733
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:49,299
They contacted me,
as a veteran-grade driver.

734
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:51,794
You might say they scouted me?

735
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:59,305
But when their call came I had
already arranged to meet with you.

736
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,095
I see...

737
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:06,475
You turned down this famous company
to work for me.

738
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,731
I won't forget that.

739
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,147
Son of a bitch!

740
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:18,200
Anyway, I can give this card
to my wife, right?

741
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:20,121
Yes, that's why I brought it up.

742
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,199
No need to mention me.

743
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:26,875
You can tell her
you found the company yourself.

744
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:28,706
Sure.

745
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,382
Thanks to you I can play
the good husband.

746
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:36,134
On the back, there's a number
for consultations.

747
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:37,464
Tell her to call there...

748
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:38,844
Eyes on the road!

749
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:47,224
Hello, this is
Senior Advisor Yeo of The Care.

750
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:50,610
Yes, this is The Care's main office?

751
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:51,779
That's correct.

752
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:55,239
If she wanted, she'd be
a fucking great con artist.

753
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:57,693
Isn't her voice tone great?
Takes after me.

754
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:01,905
From what I've heard,
it's a full membership service?

755
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:05,917
So you're not currently
a member, I assume?

756
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,586
<i>That's right. What steps do
I need to take?</i>

757
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:12,791
We'll just need to receive
a few documents from you.

758
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:15,798
Are you ready
to write this down?

759
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:20,591
Your family register,
citizenship ID cards...

760
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:24,436
...documents to prove
your income level,

761
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:27,014
i.e. the title to your property, etc.

762
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,349
Our property title?
Yes.

763
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,404
Wow, peaches!

764
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:41,278
You have some too, Mr. Kevin.

765
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:42,988
Thank you.

766
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,832
Leave it outside
the door next time.

767
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:56,589
- And knock!
- Yes.

768
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:01,013
No entering during my lesson!

769
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,181
Yes, miss!

770
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,060
<i>Park Da-song!</i>

771
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,307
Daddy!

772
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:08,855
<i>Where are you?</i>

773
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,481
Daddy!

774
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:15,530
Son!

775
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:17,147
Walkie talkies!

776
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:18,241
Walkie talkies?

777
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,325
Walkie talkies!

778
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:22,619
Who do you like better,
your dad or the walkie talkie?

779
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:25,910
Da-song, how could you run out
from your lesson?

780
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:29,831
When did you buy all this?

781
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:30,998
It's no big deal.

782
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,169
Huh?

783
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:36,337
Huh?

784
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,001
What is it?

785
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,047
What's he doing now?

786
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:44,682
Da-song, don't do that!

787
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:48,471
It's the same!
They smell the same!

788
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:51,978
What are you talking about?
Go up to Jessica.

789
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:56,103
Jessica smells like that, too.

790
00:51:57,197 --> 00:52:00,816
So do we all need
to use different soap, now?

791
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:04,778
Dad, we'll need to use
different laundry soap, too.

792
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:06,033
And fabric softener.

793
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:10,242
You mean doing four separate loads
of laundry each time?

794
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:12,160
That's not it.

795
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,213
It's the semi-basement smell.

796
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:18,883
We need to leave this home
to lose the smell.

797
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:26,634
Anyway, aren't we fortunate to be
worrying about things like this?

798
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:27,763
Sure.

799
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,721
In an age like ours,

800
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:35,643
when an opening for a security guard
attracts 500 university graduates.

801
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:39,025
Our entire family got hired!

802
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:41,231
That's right, Dad!

803
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:44,200
If we put our 4 salaries together?

804
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:48,451
The amount of cash coming
from that house into ours is immense!

805
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:53,915
Let's offer a prayer of gratitude
to the great Mr. Park.

806
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,085
And to Min!

807
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,915
Ki-woo, that friend of yours
turned into such a fine guy,

808
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:02,252
and thanks to him we're all...
Fuck, not again!

809
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:07,975
That asshole's dead.

810
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,552
Ki-woo's on the rampage!

811
00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:12,808
Don't overdo it!

812
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,562
Use this instead.

813
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:21,563
Damn you!

814
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:25,654
Get a fucking grip!

815
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,235
Get a grip!

816
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,114
Wow!

817
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:37,629
It's a deluge!

818
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:58,232
Current weather is clear, over.
The clouds are moving.

819
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:00,731
<i>But they're not rain clouds,
over.</i>

820
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:02,232
I hear you, over.

821
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:08,489
Currently your sister's lip is
pouting like a duck's bill.

822
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:11,447
She's super annoyed, over.

823
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:16,376
Can't I stay home and study English?
And call Kevin?

824
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:20,001
Hey! Don't make a scene
just as we're leaving.

825
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,423
If we have to go,
let's have fun.

826
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:25,172
Da-hye, this is no ordinary
camping trip.

827
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,095
That's right!

828
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,213
How could you miss
your brother's birthday?

829
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:29,056
No way!

830
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,299
Even your busy father is
taking time off to go.

831
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:34,181
Right! If you don't go,
you'll regret it!

832
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:38,727
Oh, right.
You know the beam projector?

833
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:39,817
The outdoor theater?

834
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:41,768
Right, bring the outdoor
beam projector.

835
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:42,654
Yes.

836
00:54:42,655 --> 00:54:46,773
And look for Da-song's
camping raincoat.

837
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,657
He loves it when it rains.

838
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:53,246
You remember now?
Zoonie, Berry, and Foofoo.

839
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:54,493
Zoonie and Berry get this.

840
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:57,371
Yes, Natural Balance Original Ultra.

841
00:54:57,461 --> 00:54:59,748
Right, and for Foofoo...

842
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,746
Kani-kamaboko.
Japanese crab sticks.

843
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,840
Yes.

844
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:05,879
When you walk Zoonie,
give him a long leash.

845
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,757
He needs to run around
to feel happy.

846
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:11,464
He's like the canine version
of Da-song!

847
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:38,783
Son!

848
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:41,996
Why are you lying down outside?

849
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:44,839
Isn't he hot out there?

850
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:50,421
I'm gazing at the sky
from home.

851
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,514
It's so great.

852
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:59,099
Mom, want some water?

853
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,396
There's sparkling, right?

854
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:03,183
Ki-jung, some water?

855
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:05,269
Telepathy... thank you.

856
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:28,834
Whoa.

857
00:56:31,597 --> 00:56:34,260
Wow, all these varieties
of alcohol.

858
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:39,469
Dad! Let me add another
to the mix!

859
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:43,018
This is pretty classy.

860
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:48,607
Rain falling on the lawn,
as we sip our whiskey...

861
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:53,942
Ki-woo, what's that yellow notebook
you've been carrying?

862
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:58,034
This?
It's Da-hye's diary.

863
00:56:58,123 --> 00:56:59,659
Her diary?

864
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:03,869
What a scumbag.
How could you read her diary?

865
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:09,834
Just so we can understand
each other deeper.

866
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:12,385
Fuck, are you two dating?

867
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:16,840
I'm serious.
She really likes me too.

868
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:20,434
A while back...

869
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:22,520
Never mind.

870
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:26,566
When she enters university,
I'll officially ask her out.

871
00:57:26,902 --> 00:57:28,188
Seriously.

872
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,573
My son!

873
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:39,412
Then this house will be
your in-laws' house?

874
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:42,998
That's right.

875
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:47,045
Fuck, then I'm washing dishes
at my daughter-in-law's?

876
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:50,373
Sure, washing
your daughter-in-law's socks!

877
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:07,356
I like her.
She's a good kid.

878
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:11,853
She's pretty,
but she's not wild.

879
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:17,150
Well, now that we're daydreaming...

880
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:20,950
If Da-hye and I marry,

881
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:24,874
we can bring in actors
to be my mom and dad.

882
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:26,955
Look at her.

883
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:30,580
She got so many jobs acting
in weddings last year.

884
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:35,176
I even caught the bouquet
from a bitch I've never met.

885
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:38,388
If you get the bouquet,
they pay an extra $10.

886
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,632
That's how your acting got so good!

887
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:46,097
Acting is one thing,
but this family is so gullible, right?

888
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:48,397
The madame especially.

889
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:50,099
You said it.

890
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:55,238
She's so naive, and nice.

891
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:57,657
She's rich, but still nice.

892
00:58:57,743 --> 00:58:59,951
Not "rich, but still nice."

893
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:03,784
"Nice because she's rich."
You know?

894
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:10,788
Hell, if I had all this money.

895
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:15,751
I'd be nice too!

896
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,630
Even nicer!

897
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,008
That's true.
Your mom's right.

898
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:22,590
Rich people are naive.
No resentments.

899
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:25,142
No creases on them.

900
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:28,312
It all gets ironed out.
Money is an iron.

901
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:31,057
Those creases all get smoothed out.

902
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:32,434
Hey, Ki-woo.

903
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:37,943
You know that driver, Yoon?
Was it Yoon?

904
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:40,904
The driver before me.

905
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,405
Yeah, Yoon.

906
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:47,082
He must be working somewhere else now,
right?

907
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:49,500
Sure, he must be.

908
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:52,829
He's young, got a nice physique.

909
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:56,291
He must've found a better job.

910
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:58,626
Fucking hell!

911
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:01,633
What's with her now?

912
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:08,137
We're the ones who need help.
Worry about us, okay?

913
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:11,856
Dad! Come on, Dad!

914
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:16,394
Just focus on us, okay?
On us!

915
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:20,948
Not Driver Yoon, but me, please!

916
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:23,159
Awesome timing, huh?

917
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:27,030
She speaks,
and the lightning crashes!

918
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:31,960
Hey, Jessica. Cheers.

919
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:38,630
Hey, when I went up before,
and you were in the bath...

920
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:40,300
What about it?

921
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:44,343
How to put it?
You fit in here.

922
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:47,596
This rich house suits you.
Not like us.

923
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:48,602
Fuck off.

924
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:49,521
I'm serious!

925
01:00:49,522 --> 01:00:51,262
Dad, before...

926
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:54,019
She was lying back in the tub,
watching TV.

927
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:56,901
Like she's lived here for years.

928
01:00:58,864 --> 01:01:04,701
Speaking of which,
if this became our house,

929
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:08,947
if we lived here,
which room would you want?

930
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:14,252
What room in this masterwork
by the great Namgoong?

931
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:16,374
Fuck, I don't know.

932
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:20,128
Get me the house first.
Then I'll think about it.

933
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:22,710
We live here now, don't we?

934
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:26,969
Getting drunk in the living room.

935
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:30,138
Right, we live here.
Why not?

936
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:34,685
This is our home right now.
It's cosy.

937
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,813
Cosy? Are you feeling cosy?

938
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:42,898
Sure, but suppose Park walked
through that door now.

939
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:44,902
What about your dad?

940
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:48,369
He'd run and hide like a cockroach.

941
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:51,364
Kids, you know at our house,

942
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:57,045
when you turn on the light,
and the cockroaches scatter?

943
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,996
You know what I mean?

944
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:02,751
I'm getting fucking tired of this.

945
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:05,343
- A cockroach?
- Yeah.

946
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,762
Huh? What's wrong?

947
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:12,184
What's the matter?

948
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:15,854
Dad, don't do that.
You only live once.

949
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:24,863
What the hell?

950
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:26,652
I fooled you!
Didn't I?

951
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,109
Jesus, Dad.

952
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:32,368
I fooled you too, Ki-woo?
Did it look for real?

953
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:35,871
If it was for real,
I'd fucking kill you.

954
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:39,872
What is this?
Fucking puppy.

955
01:02:45,637 --> 01:02:47,720
Who is it at this hour?

956
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:49,596
What is it?

957
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:57,479
What's she doing here?

958
01:02:57,691 --> 01:02:59,978
The old housekeeper?

959
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:02,356
What's she here for?

960
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:07,023
She won't stop ringing it.

961
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:10,743
Raising a racket.

962
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,205
Who is it?

963
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:17,701
Oh, hello! I'm...

964
01:03:18,086 --> 01:03:19,748
The madame's not in, right?

965
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:20,838
What?

966
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:25,209
I worked here
for a very long time.

967
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:31,506
Above the monitor there,
you see a photo of 3 dogs, right?

968
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,010
Zoonie, Berry, Foofoo.

969
01:03:33,101 --> 01:03:37,391
I get it,
but why are you here?

970
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:42,108
You're my successor
as housekeeper, right?

971
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,776
Anyway...

972
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:52,861
I'm very sorry
to call on you so late.

973
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:54,578
It's just that...

974
01:03:55,165 --> 01:04:02,165
I forgot something in the basement
under the kitchen.

975
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:08,802
When I left, they pushed me out
so quickly...

976
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:14,139
Would you let me in?

977
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:18,098
What do we do?

978
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:21,021
This isn't in the plan.

979
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:30,569
Sorry for the trouble.

980
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:32,153
This way.

981
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:33,279
Yes, thank you.

982
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:37,871
You can put your raincoat...

983
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:40,119
It'll just be a second.

984
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:44,620
Quite a meal there.
That'll be a job to clean up.

985
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:47,882
But what did you leave below?

986
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:54,839
Want to come down with me?

987
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:59,347
Well, just go ahead.

988
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:55,741
Help me push this!

989
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:58,778
Pull it! From over there.

990
01:05:58,872 --> 01:06:00,113
What?

991
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:01,534
Pull!

992
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,576
Pull it hard!

993
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:10,918
Are you okay?

994
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:13,800
Did I scare you?

995
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:17,554
Thank you!

996
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:20,265
Thank you.

997
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:29,443
Honey!

998
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:30,943
What the hell?

999
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,069
Hey!

1000
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:34,488
Honey!

1001
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,032
Honey!

1002
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:40,740
Wait!

1003
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:42,989
Honey, I'm here!

1004
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:44,699
What is all this?

1005
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,001
Honey!

1006
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:50,000
Honey, I'm fine.

1007
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:51,796
No you're not!

1008
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:53,172
I'm fine, really.

1009
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:54,420
How can you say that?

1010
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:56,252
But I'm really hungry.

1011
01:06:56,346 --> 01:06:57,346
Suck it!

1012
01:06:57,388 --> 01:07:00,381
How many days has it been?

1013
01:07:00,642 --> 01:07:02,349
You must've been so hungry!

1014
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:05,681
It's okay.

1015
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:08,515
She's a nice woman. She let me in.

1016
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:10,645
There was an iron plate,
for grilling meat.

1017
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:12,271
It was wedged under the shelf.

1018
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:13,398
So that's why.

1019
01:07:13,488 --> 01:07:16,822
I couldn't open it
from the inside.

1020
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:20,113
- What's going on here?
- I know you must be startled.

1021
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:23,029
I would be too in this situation.

1022
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:27,951
But as two fellow workers...
Right, Chung-sook?

1023
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:30,832
How do you know my name?

1024
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:35,959
To be honest I'm still texting
with the boy Da-song.

1025
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:40,717
I knew they were going camping,
so I came today.

1026
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:43,465
I wanted to speak to you alone.

1027
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:45,092
<i>Talking about.</i>

1028
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:49,643
Don't worry, Chung-sook.

1029
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:53,230
I cut the wire
on the CCTV by the gate.

1030
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:57,321
Nobody knows I came.
Isn't that good, sis?

1031
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:59,444
Don't call me sis!

1032
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:02,447
Sis, my name is Moon-gwang.

1033
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:07,074
This is my hubbie Oh Geun-sae.
Say hello, honey.

1034
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:10,534
This tastes great.
What happened to your face?

1035
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:13,917
I'll tell you later.

1036
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:17,967
So you'd steal food every day
while working in the kitchen.

1037
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:19,293
Feeding your husband.

1038
01:08:19,387 --> 01:08:23,722
Not at all! I bought all his food
with my salary.

1039
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:26,888
That's so unfair!

1040
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:29,641
But how long has
your husband been down here?

1041
01:08:29,731 --> 01:08:32,189
Hold on a sec.
4 years?

1042
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:35,852
4 years, 3 months and 17 days.

1043
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,777
Right, it's June now.

1044
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:44,110
Four years ago
when Mr. Namgoong moved to Paris,

1045
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:47,075
in the time before Mr. Park's family
moved in,

1046
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:51,117
I brought my husband down here.

1047
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:56,046
Many rich houses have secret bunkers,
where you can hide

1048
01:08:56,215 --> 01:09:00,835
in case North Korea attacks,
or if creditors break in.

1049
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:06,932
But it seems Mr. Namgoong was
a bit embarrassed about this,

1050
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:10,887
because he never mentioned it
to Mr. Park's family.

1051
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:12,521
So only I know about it.

1052
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:14,894
So that's how it happened.

1053
01:09:15,193 --> 01:09:19,403
But now that I know, I've no choice
but to call the police!

1054
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:21,321
No please, sis!

1055
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:24,737
As fellow members of the needy,
please don't.

1056
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:26,318
I'm not needy!

1057
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:30,122
But we're needy!

1058
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:34,452
We've no house, no money,
only debts!

1059
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:35,953
Sis, please!

1060
01:09:36,047 --> 01:09:40,508
Even after 4 years of hiding,
those debt collectors won't give up.

1061
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:44,803
They're still searching for him,
threatening to stab him.

1062
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:46,425
You used loan sharks?

1063
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,174
It's all my fault.

1064
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:51,260
The Taiwan cake shop.

1065
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:55,644
My Taiwanese Wangshui
castella shop went bust.

1066
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:57,858
I was overwhelmed by debt.

1067
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,609
Please take this.

1068
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:01,403
What's that?

1069
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:05,737
It's not much,
just a modest sum.

1070
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:08,490
But we'll send it
to you every month.

1071
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:10,870
In return,
just once every 2 days,

1072
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:13,950
please leave him some food.

1073
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:17,624
No no, just once a week.

1074
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:20,414
There's a refrigerator here.
Just once a week.

1075
01:10:20,508 --> 01:10:23,626
You've got some nerve!
I'm calling the police.

1076
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:24,720
Sis!

1077
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:28,342
Who is that?

1078
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:33,139
Wait... Jessica?

1079
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:35,099
Mr. Kim?

1080
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:36,270
What the hell?

1081
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:38,849
Dad, my ankle!

1082
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:40,059
You okay?
Sorry.

1083
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:42,236
Dad, my foot.

1084
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:44,108
Don't call me Dad!

1085
01:10:51,122 --> 01:10:55,036
I thought it was weird
when the driver was fired.

1086
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:56,626
Hey!

1087
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:58,994
- Let's talk things over.
- What the hell?

1088
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:00,499
Are you some family of charlatans?

1089
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:01,548
So, sis...

1090
01:11:01,549 --> 01:11:03,836
Don't fucking call me sis,
you filthy bitch!

1091
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:09,301
I'm gonna send this video
to the madame, how about that?

1092
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:11,347
<i>Dad, my foot.</i>

1093
01:11:11,559 --> 01:11:13,767
No reception in the basement,
right?

1094
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:16,303
- The phone works fine.
- Fuck.

1095
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:21,108
Ma'am, to be honest,
the jobs we have here...

1096
01:11:21,194 --> 01:11:24,107
Shut up!
It's too late now!

1097
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:27,531
Let's all go to jail!
We're fucking going down!

1098
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:30,530
Lady, are you crazy?

1099
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:36,240
If they see that video, Mr. Park
and his wife will be so shocked!

1100
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:39,790
What did those nice people
ever do wrong?

1101
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:41,630
Why do this to them?

1102
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:42,879
Stop right there!

1103
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:45,374
Or I'll push the 'send' button.

1104
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:47,168
Follow me.

1105
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:50,342
Calm down, ma'am.

1106
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:55,933
Don't push!

1107
01:11:57,188 --> 01:11:58,770
Let's go up, honey.

1108
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:01,853
Time for you to get some fresh air!

1109
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:25,165
Honey, this 'send' button is
like a missile launcher.

1110
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:27,545
What do you mean, honey?

1111
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:33,297
If we threaten to push it,
those people can't do anything.

1112
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:37,767
It's like a North Korean rocket.
A North Korean missile button!

1113
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:42,932
Today our beloved
Great Leader Kim Jong-un,

1114
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:46,151
after witnessing
the charlatan family video,

1115
01:12:46,237 --> 01:12:48,900
was unable to contain
his shock and fury

1116
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:52,154
at their wicked,
despicable provocation!

1117
01:12:52,243 --> 01:12:54,200
I've missed your jokes, honey!

1118
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:58,827
Therefore our Great Leader,
in this age of denuclearization,

1119
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:04,662
has commanded that the nation's
last remaining nuclear warhead

1120
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:07,293
be driven down the throats
of this wicked family!

1121
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:12,048
No one can imitate North Korean
news anchors like you!

1122
01:13:12,138 --> 01:13:17,384
With their stinking guts serving
as the last nuclear graveyard,

1123
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:22,141
our Dear Leader's wish to denuclearize
and bring world peace can...

1124
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,018
Hands in the air, fuckers!

1125
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:25,853
Higher!

1126
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:29,815
You scumbag family.

1127
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:31,022
Husband?

1128
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,032
Husband.

1129
01:13:32,033 --> 01:13:32,991
Wife?

1130
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:33,867
Yes.

1131
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:35,530
- Son?
- Yes.

1132
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:36,861
- Daughter?
- Daughter.

1133
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:38,741
You neanderthals.

1134
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:43,125
Is that all you can think to do,
drink yourselves stupid?

1135
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:48,543
In this home suffused
with Mr. Namgoong's creative spirit?

1136
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:49,880
You cretins!

1137
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:51,333
What do you know about art?

1138
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:53,544
What would they know?

1139
01:13:54,347 --> 01:14:01,347
When the sun was nice,
we'd bask in those sunbeams, right?

1140
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:07,270
At such moments we could feel
his artistic touch.

1141
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:58,366
Give it to me!

1142
01:15:17,555 --> 01:15:21,299
Good job!
Delete it!

1143
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:25,136
Careful, don't send it by accident.

1144
01:15:39,577 --> 01:15:40,863
Hello?

1145
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:44,992
Listen, do you know
how to make ram-don?

1146
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:46,665
Ram-don?

1147
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:50,165
Da-song likes ram-don
more than anything.

1148
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:53,960
If you boil the water now,
the timing will be perfect.

1149
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:57,091
<i>There's sirloin in the fridge,
add that too.</i>

1150
01:15:57,178 --> 01:15:58,794
Then, the camping...?

1151
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:02,347
<i>My god, what a disaster.</i>

1152
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:08,183
The river overflowed and
everyone was packing their tents,

1153
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:11,352
but Da-song was crying
and refusing to go home.

1154
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:15,436
<i>Anyway, ram-don as soon
as we walk in, okay?</i>

1155
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:18,238
Then you're almost here?

1156
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:20,823
8 minutes, according to the GPS.

1157
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:22,408
You arrive in 8 minutes...

1158
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:25,988
<i>Start boiling
the water right away!</i>

1159
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:31,876
What the hell is ram-don?

1160
01:16:40,888 --> 01:16:42,550
Move, quickly!

1161
01:16:43,641 --> 01:16:45,348
Hurry!

1162
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:54,061
<i>Ramen / Udon</i>

1163
01:16:55,945 --> 01:16:58,653
Dad, I can't drag her any further!

1164
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:11,533
What are you doing?

1165
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,544
Dad!

1166
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:20,796
Go up quickly!
Help upstairs.

1167
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:29,885
Take this!

1168
01:17:49,123 --> 01:17:50,330
Welcome home!

1169
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:53,784
Da-song, look!
Let's eat ram-don!

1170
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:57,170
<i>Da-song!</i>

1171
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:02,000
<i>Da-song!</i>

1172
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:09,807
Madame!

1173
01:18:28,162 --> 01:18:30,404
Why don't you
just eat the ram-don?

1174
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:31,414
Shall I?

1175
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:34,453
No wait. I can give it
to my husband.

1176
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,455
There's sirloin in here.

1177
01:18:39,006 --> 01:18:42,670
It's cooked through?
Medium well done.

1178
01:19:07,868 --> 01:19:13,705
<i>Returning after a day's work...
I love you so much, Mr. Park!</i>

1179
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:20,041
<i>Home from the office,
Mr. Park is off duty now.</i>

1180
01:19:22,132 --> 01:19:26,422
<i>Returning after a day's work...
I love you so much, Mr. Park!</i>

1181
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:28,424
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!

1182
01:19:39,984 --> 01:19:42,351
Honey, do you want some ram-don?

1183
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:43,647
Da-song doesn't want it?

1184
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:44,445
No.

1185
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:46,483
No, I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.

1186
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:49,483
Why are you staring?

1187
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:54,242
Mr. Park, you feed me
and house me.

1188
01:19:54,331 --> 01:19:55,663
<i>Respect!</i>

1189
01:19:57,751 --> 01:19:59,492
You do this every day?

1190
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:05,336
Sure, I even send whole sentences
to thank him.

1191
01:20:05,926 --> 01:20:08,168
Someone of your age should know it.

1192
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:09,262
Know what?

1193
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:10,921
Morse Code.

1194
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:15,342
That sensor's going batty.

1195
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:27,153
Da-song will know it,
since he's a Scout.

1196
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:28,863
It's ridiculous, right?

1197
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:32,484
Running around,
trying to please a kid.

1198
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:34,618
He's not some kind of prince.

1199
01:20:34,872 --> 01:20:37,330
He's the youngest. It's common.

1200
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:40,161
Please understand.

1201
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:44,162
Da-song is a bit... unwell.

1202
01:20:44,715 --> 01:20:47,503
He's receiving trauma therapy
and art therapy.

1203
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:50,634
There was an incident.

1204
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:52,129
What incident?

1205
01:20:52,556 --> 01:20:55,845
Sis, you believe in ghosts, too?

1206
01:20:57,519 --> 01:21:01,012
Da-song saw a ghost in the house
when he was in 1st grade.

1207
01:21:07,613 --> 01:21:10,196
He had a birthday party
at home that day.

1208
01:21:10,491 --> 01:21:12,949
Late that night,
when everyone was sleeping,

1209
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:17,279
Da-song crept down to the kitchen
and took the cake out.

1210
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:20,619
The whipped cream
on that cake was amazing.

1211
01:21:20,834 --> 01:21:23,417
Even in bed, he couldn't stop
thinking about it.

1212
01:21:24,046 --> 01:21:29,417
So Da-song was sitting,
eating his cake...

1213
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:42,057
He screamed,
and I ran downstairs,

1214
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:44,476
and he was all...

1215
01:21:45,192 --> 01:21:50,358
his eyes rolled back in his head,
convulsions, foam in his mouth.

1216
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:54,820
Have you ever seen
a child have a seizure?

1217
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:55,828
No.

1218
01:21:55,829 --> 01:22:00,789
They need 15-minute treatment,
or they're done for.

1219
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:05,373
That's the time you have to reach
an emergency room, 15 minutes.

1220
01:22:06,547 --> 01:22:12,009
How can you live
in a place like this?

1221
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:15,174
Well, lots of people
live underground.

1222
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:17,297
Especially if you count
semi-basements.

1223
01:22:17,391 --> 01:22:21,681
What'll you do?
You don't have a plan?

1224
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:25,472
I just feel comfortable here.

1225
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:29,688
It feels like I was born here.

1226
01:22:30,737 --> 01:22:33,730
Maybe I had my wedding here, too.

1227
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:37,158
As for the National Pension,
I don't qualify.

1228
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:41,954
In my old age,
love will comfort me.

1229
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:48,791
So please.
Let me live down here.

1230
01:22:50,757 --> 01:22:52,089
Anyway...

1231
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:57,967
My husband was away on business,
so I had to deal with it all.

1232
01:22:58,724 --> 01:23:02,934
Since then we've always
gone out for his birthday.

1233
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:05,766
Last year my mother's house,
this year, camping.

1234
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:11,026
Da-song's dad says it's just
a part of growing up.

1235
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:15,776
They say a ghost
in the house brings wealth.

1236
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:21,779
Actually, the money's been
good recently.

1237
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:50,356
Thank god.

1238
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:19,878
Just stay here for now.

1239
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:32,598
Zoonie, what's wrong?

1240
01:24:35,237 --> 01:24:36,773
Something under there?

1241
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:39,488
What is it?

1242
01:24:40,701 --> 01:24:42,033
Damn it!

1243
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:44,573
- Mom!
- Yeah?

1244
01:24:44,663 --> 01:24:47,030
- How could you?
- What?

1245
01:24:47,124 --> 01:24:51,209
I like ram-don too!
How could you not even ask me?

1246
01:24:51,545 --> 01:24:52,421
Well...

1247
01:24:52,422 --> 01:24:56,210
Da-song didn't want it, so you asked Dad,
then ate it yourself.

1248
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:57,300
Want her to make one?

1249
01:24:57,342 --> 01:24:59,208
That's not the point!

1250
01:24:59,303 --> 01:25:02,637
- Stop fighting over ramen!
- Why didn't you ask me?

1251
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:05,715
Oh, stop it! Just go to bed.
Go get changed.

1252
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:11,471
This way!

1253
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:14,609
And Ki-jung?

1254
01:25:14,693 --> 01:25:17,060
Under there! Hurry!

1255
01:25:19,406 --> 01:25:22,990
One, two, three! One, two three!

1256
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:24,362
Da-song?

1257
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:26,906
Da-song, cut it out!

1258
01:25:27,414 --> 01:25:30,157
He's gone crazy!
Get an umbrella.

1259
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:31,995
Hey Park Da-song!

1260
01:25:33,503 --> 01:25:37,713
What a monster.
What the hell is he doing?

1261
01:25:38,425 --> 01:25:42,169
Da-song, it's time for bed!
You know how late it is?

1262
01:25:42,262 --> 01:25:43,423
Here.

1263
01:25:44,264 --> 01:25:45,721
Honey, here.

1264
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:55,728
Who do you take after to be so stubborn!
Look at this rain!

1265
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:03,864
<i>OMG Kevin. Da-song camping
in the yard.</i>

1266
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:12,119
Hey, channel 3 for emergencies!
Keep it turned on.

1267
01:26:12,751 --> 01:26:15,494
Let me have it.
I can't believe him.

1268
01:26:16,088 --> 01:26:18,671
Just leave him.
He'll come in if he's tired.

1269
01:26:18,882 --> 01:26:21,670
<i>- I want you here, honey.
- I'm with you.</i>

1270
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,001
Hey, Da-hye!

1271
01:26:23,095 --> 01:26:25,553
Stop using your phone.
Go to bed.

1272
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:28,510
Go sleep in your room.
We'll take care of things.

1273
01:26:28,642 --> 01:26:31,931
This is the living room,
do you copy?

1274
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:33,101
<i>Copy, over.</i>

1275
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:37,148
Daddy is standing by
for emergencies, over.

1276
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:39,767
<i>Got it, over.</i>

1277
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:43,150
Is that tent going to leak?

1278
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:46,483
We ordered from the U.S.,
it'll be fine.

1279
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:49,619
- Should we sleep here?
- What?

1280
01:26:49,746 --> 01:26:51,954
We've got a full view of the tent.

1281
01:26:52,082 --> 01:26:53,948
Good idea.
I'll feel much better.

1282
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:54,834
Right?

1283
01:26:54,835 --> 01:26:56,827
Let's watch over him as we sleep.

1284
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:00,455
What a kid...

1285
01:27:09,683 --> 01:27:11,049
Wait a minute.

1286
01:27:13,478 --> 01:27:15,640
Where's that smell coming from?

1287
01:27:15,731 --> 01:27:17,017
What smell?

1288
01:27:17,315 --> 01:27:18,772
Mr. Kim's smell.

1289
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:20,770
- Mr. Kim?
- Yeah.

1290
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:22,936
Not sure what you mean.

1291
01:27:23,029 --> 01:27:25,988
Really?
You must have smelled it.

1292
01:27:26,366 --> 01:27:30,326
That smell that wafts through the car,
how to describe it?

1293
01:27:30,412 --> 01:27:33,155
- An old man's smell?
- No no, it's not that.

1294
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:34,955
What is it?

1295
01:27:35,584 --> 01:27:37,576
Like an old radish?

1296
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:39,251
No.

1297
01:27:39,546 --> 01:27:41,788
You know when you boil a rag?

1298
01:27:41,882 --> 01:27:43,293
It smells like that.

1299
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:52,174
Anyway, even though he always seems
about to cross the line,

1300
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:55,351
he never does cross it.
That's good.

1301
01:27:55,562 --> 01:27:57,269
- I'll give him credit.
- Yeah.

1302
01:27:58,398 --> 01:28:00,685
But that smell crosses the line.

1303
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:03,563
It powers through right
into the back seat.

1304
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:05,686
How bad can it be?

1305
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:07,022
I don't know.

1306
01:28:07,741 --> 01:28:10,233
It's hard to describe.

1307
01:28:11,244 --> 01:28:14,863
But you sometimes smell it
on the subway.

1308
01:28:14,998 --> 01:28:18,241
It's been ages
since I rode a subway.

1309
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,919
People who ride the subway
have a special smell.

1310
01:28:22,005 --> 01:28:23,212
Yeah.

1311
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:42,147
Isn't this like the car's back seat?

1312
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:46,523
What if Da-song comes back in?

1313
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:48,646
Don't worry!

1314
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:51,904
I can just pull my hand back.

1315
01:28:57,541 --> 01:28:59,032
We shouldn't...

1316
01:29:05,131 --> 01:29:06,793
Do it clockwise.

1317
01:29:07,509 --> 01:29:08,670
Right.

1318
01:29:12,055 --> 01:29:14,843
You know where.

1319
01:29:31,741 --> 01:29:35,405
You still have those cheap panties?

1320
01:29:35,829 --> 01:29:36,865
Huh?

1321
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:39,785
The ones Yoon's girlfriend left behind.

1322
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:43,910
If you wear those,
I'll get really fucking hard.

1323
01:29:44,671 --> 01:29:46,003
Really?

1324
01:29:46,464 --> 01:29:49,002
Then buy me drugs.

1325
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:52,794
Buy me drugs!

1326
01:29:54,681 --> 01:29:56,263
Eat this instead.

1327
01:30:08,111 --> 01:30:09,647
You like it?

1328
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:32,417
<i>They're passed out cold.
Sneak out now.</i>

1329
01:31:06,586 --> 01:31:09,044
<i>Emergency! Emergency, over!</i>

1330
01:31:11,341 --> 01:31:12,923
<i>- Emergency!</i>
- What?

1331
01:31:13,843 --> 01:31:15,084
What is it, over!

1332
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:16,464
Da-song, what's wrong?

1333
01:31:17,013 --> 01:31:19,096
<i>I can't sleep, over.</i>

1334
01:31:19,516 --> 01:31:23,226
So stop it and come in, okay?

1335
01:31:23,561 --> 01:31:26,099
Go sleep in your soft bed, over.

1336
01:31:26,272 --> 01:31:27,558
Right!

1337
01:31:27,774 --> 01:31:29,857
<i>I don't want to, over.</i>

1338
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:31,817
Hey, Park Da-song.

1339
01:31:36,783 --> 01:31:38,615
Let's just sleep...

1340
01:33:14,172 --> 01:33:17,711
How did it turn out back there?

1341
01:33:18,676 --> 01:33:19,917
What?

1342
01:33:22,097 --> 01:33:24,214
The people in the basement.

1343
01:33:27,102 --> 01:33:31,267
Well, I tied them up.

1344
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:33,563
What will we do now?

1345
01:33:35,026 --> 01:33:36,267
Huh?

1346
01:33:38,404 --> 01:33:41,568
What do we do now,
what's our plan?

1347
01:33:42,575 --> 01:33:45,409
I've been wondering...

1348
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:49,451
What would Min do
in this situation?

1349
01:33:51,167 --> 01:33:53,955
Min wouldn't be
in this situation!

1350
01:33:55,505 --> 01:34:01,172
Look kids, we made it
out of there safely, right?

1351
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:07,556
And besides us, nobody knows
what happened there. Right?

1352
01:34:07,976 --> 01:34:10,434
So nothing happened.
You understand?

1353
01:34:11,855 --> 01:34:16,225
I've got my own plan.

1354
01:34:16,818 --> 01:34:19,686
So you two just forget
about it, okay?

1355
01:34:21,030 --> 01:34:23,022
Let's go home.

1356
01:34:23,616 --> 01:34:25,573
Let's go take a bath.

1357
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:46,879
What are you doing there?
Hurry up!

1358
01:35:01,321 --> 01:35:03,062
What's going on?

1359
01:35:04,866 --> 01:35:07,574
You stay there.
This is all sewage water.

1360
01:35:07,744 --> 01:35:10,578
Was our window open?

1361
01:35:14,626 --> 01:35:17,710
Help me out, Ki-taek!

1362
01:35:25,929 --> 01:35:27,295
Ki-woo!

1363
01:35:29,599 --> 01:35:32,387
Hey Ki-woo, close the window!

1364
01:35:34,354 --> 01:35:35,640
You got shocked?

1365
01:35:42,528 --> 01:35:44,019
I'm dizzy.

1366
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:51,573
Hold on a sec.
Wait.

1367
01:35:57,377 --> 01:35:59,084
Shit, I'm dizzy.

1368
01:36:03,299 --> 01:36:05,586
Ki-jung, be careful.

1369
01:36:07,303 --> 01:36:09,090
Don't touch anything.

1370
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:26,896
Honey, I've got a concussion.

1371
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:29,690
I can't see you.

1372
01:36:51,139 --> 01:36:55,554
Honey, that woman Chung-sook...

1373
01:36:56,436 --> 01:36:58,348
Oh, god.

1374
01:36:58,521 --> 01:37:00,513
What a nice person.

1375
01:37:02,358 --> 01:37:05,351
She kicked me down the stairs.

1376
01:37:07,947 --> 01:37:09,939
Repeat after me.

1377
01:37:10,742 --> 01:37:12,904
Chung-sook...

1378
01:37:14,871 --> 01:37:17,784
Chung-sook...

1379
01:37:27,467 --> 01:37:29,333
Hey, Ki-woo!

1380
01:37:30,636 --> 01:37:32,172
What are you doing there?

1381
01:37:32,263 --> 01:37:33,504
Huh?

1382
01:37:48,237 --> 01:37:52,106
<i>h o l p... M...</i>

1383
01:38:57,765 --> 01:38:58,926
Dad.

1384
01:38:59,559 --> 01:39:00,720
Yeah?

1385
01:39:01,811 --> 01:39:05,304
What was your plan?

1386
01:39:07,233 --> 01:39:09,020
What are you talking about?

1387
01:39:10,153 --> 01:39:12,736
Before, you said you had a plan.

1388
01:39:13,114 --> 01:39:15,276
What will you do?
About...

1389
01:39:16,075 --> 01:39:17,361
the basement.

1390
01:39:18,077 --> 01:39:23,823
Ki-woo, you know
what kind of plan never fails?

1391
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:27,952
No plan at all.

1392
01:39:28,296 --> 01:39:29,753
<i>No plan.</i>

1393
01:39:30,506 --> 01:39:31,963
You know why?

1394
01:39:33,801 --> 01:39:40,173
If you make a plan,
life never works out that way.

1395
01:39:41,142 --> 01:39:42,724
Look around us.

1396
01:39:43,144 --> 01:39:48,560
Did these people think,
"Let's all spend the night in a gym?"

1397
01:39:49,484 --> 01:39:51,100
But look now.

1398
01:39:51,569 --> 01:39:55,188
Everyone's sleeping on the floor,
us included.

1399
01:39:57,116 --> 01:40:00,154
That's why people shouldn't make plans.

1400
01:40:02,330 --> 01:40:06,165
With no plan,
nothing can go wrong.

1401
01:40:06,459 --> 01:40:12,956
And if something spins out of control,
it doesn't matter.

1402
01:40:14,217 --> 01:40:16,960
Whether you kill someone,
or betray your country.

1403
01:40:18,596 --> 01:40:22,180
None of it fucking matters.
Got it?

1404
01:40:24,227 --> 01:40:25,559
Dad.

1405
01:40:27,647 --> 01:40:29,013
I'm sorry.

1406
01:40:29,857 --> 01:40:31,314
For what?

1407
01:40:34,654 --> 01:40:36,020
Everything.

1408
01:40:37,073 --> 01:40:38,484
All of it.

1409
01:40:40,826 --> 01:40:42,533
I'll take care of everything.

1410
01:40:43,746 --> 01:40:45,578
What are you talking about?

1411
01:40:47,917 --> 01:40:50,284
Why are you hugging that stone?

1412
01:40:51,254 --> 01:40:52,586
This?

1413
01:40:58,344 --> 01:41:01,178
It keeps clinging to me.

1414
01:41:05,851 --> 01:41:07,843
I think you need some sleep.

1415
01:41:10,731 --> 01:41:12,188
I'm serious.

1416
01:41:14,110 --> 01:41:16,193
It keeps following me.

1417
01:41:28,874 --> 01:41:31,582
Miss Jessica! Sorry to call
on Sunday morning.

1418
01:41:31,794 --> 01:41:34,081
Are you free for lunch today?

1419
01:41:34,171 --> 01:41:38,006
<i>We're having a birthday impromptu
for Da-song.</i>

1420
01:41:39,552 --> 01:41:41,293
A birthday party?

1421
01:41:41,387 --> 01:41:44,596
If you come too,
Da-song will be so happy.

1422
01:41:45,057 --> 01:41:48,767
And have as much pasta, gratin,
and salmon steak as you want.

1423
01:41:49,228 --> 01:41:51,311
<i>Please come by 1PM,</i>

1424
01:41:51,397 --> 01:41:54,356
and I'll count today
as one of your lessons.

1425
01:41:54,442 --> 01:41:57,105
You know what I mean?
See you soon!

1426
01:41:58,446 --> 01:41:59,903
- Mom.
- Yeah?

1427
01:41:59,989 --> 01:42:03,608
For the impromptu,
should we invite Kevin too?

1428
01:42:03,701 --> 01:42:06,409
Great idea! Why not?
Will you call him?

1429
01:42:06,621 --> 01:42:10,410
Get some more sleep, honey!
You must be tired after yesterday.

1430
01:42:10,625 --> 01:42:14,619
If we have a party,
won't you need to do the rounds?

1431
01:42:14,795 --> 01:42:18,960
Right, the wine shop,
supermarket, bakery, florist...

1432
01:42:19,175 --> 01:42:22,543
But I already told Mr. Kim
to hurry over.

1433
01:42:22,887 --> 01:42:24,298
I'll pay him overtime.

1434
01:42:24,388 --> 01:42:25,388
Perfect

1435
01:42:35,816 --> 01:42:39,981
Everyone sit down,
I'll explain!

1436
01:42:40,071 --> 01:42:43,235
<i>Da-hye: We're having a party,</i>

1437
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:45,482
<i>and mom said to invite you!</i>

1438
01:42:47,787 --> 01:42:50,780
<i>Sis, in the basement...</i>

1439
01:42:51,165 --> 01:42:53,498
we have 10 outdoor tables.

1440
01:42:53,584 --> 01:42:57,419
First take them all out,
then arrange them...

1441
01:42:58,089 --> 01:43:01,173
No, come to the window.
I need to show you.

1442
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:04,842
With Da-song's tent
in the middle,

1443
01:43:04,970 --> 01:43:08,338
curve the tables outward...

1444
01:43:08,766 --> 01:43:10,507
A crane's wing formation!

1445
01:43:10,893 --> 01:43:14,011
Like Admiral Yi used, you know?
The Battle of Hansan Island!

1446
01:43:14,438 --> 01:43:16,771
Think of the tent
as the Japanese warship.

1447
01:43:16,857 --> 01:43:22,148
And our tables will make
a semicircular crane's wing formation.

1448
01:43:22,238 --> 01:43:26,403
Then near the tent will be
the barbeque grill, firewood and such.

1449
01:43:26,492 --> 01:43:28,484
Arrange them all there!

1450
01:43:29,078 --> 01:43:32,446
Oh sure, bring your husband too!

1451
01:43:32,540 --> 01:43:33,540
Yeah.

1452
01:43:33,624 --> 01:43:37,208
And definitely no presents,
just come!

1453
01:43:37,294 --> 01:43:38,086
Yeah.

1454
01:43:38,087 --> 01:43:40,124
What dress code?

1455
01:43:40,214 --> 01:43:43,548
It's an impromptu.
You can wear sweat pants!

1456
01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:50,590
And definitely no presents!
Just come and eat hors d'oeuvres!

1457
01:43:51,684 --> 01:43:53,641
You know my culinary skills!

1458
01:43:53,894 --> 01:43:58,605
Right! We'll get drunk
in the daytime.

1459
01:43:59,066 --> 01:44:00,066
Yeah.

1460
01:44:00,151 --> 01:44:03,986
If you'd sing, that'd be grand!
You know the one...

1461
01:44:19,795 --> 01:44:22,663
Quiet, he's sleeping!

1462
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:26,299
Today the sky's so blue,
and no pollution!

1463
01:44:26,635 --> 01:44:28,672
Thanks to all the rain yesterday.

1464
01:44:29,847 --> 01:44:30,963
Right.

1465
01:44:31,182 --> 01:44:34,971
So we traded camping
for a garden party.

1466
01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:37,681
Lemons into lemonade.

1467
01:44:41,066 --> 01:44:45,857
Right, that rain was such
a blessing!

1468
01:44:47,448 --> 01:44:51,909
And definitely no presents,
I mean it!

1469
01:44:52,661 --> 01:44:56,280
Right, just squeeze
your Mini Cooper into the garage.

1470
01:44:56,373 --> 01:44:57,955
Go on up!

1471
01:44:58,083 --> 01:45:03,203
Right, back it in.
Just don't block the Benz!

1472
01:45:03,297 --> 01:45:07,541
You're here!
It's been so long!

1473
01:45:08,636 --> 01:45:11,128
I told you no presents!

1474
01:45:29,532 --> 01:45:31,364
You were thinking of something else.

1475
01:45:31,867 --> 01:45:33,108
What?

1476
01:45:34,078 --> 01:45:37,537
While kissing me,
you thought of something else.

1477
01:45:39,583 --> 01:45:40,699
No.

1478
01:45:41,585 --> 01:45:45,078
What do you mean?
You're doing it now, too.

1479
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:49,041
Wow.

1480
01:45:50,928 --> 01:45:53,215
Everyone looks gorgeous, right?

1481
01:45:54,807 --> 01:45:58,471
Even for a sudden gathering,
they're so cool.

1482
01:45:59,812 --> 01:46:01,644
And look so natural.

1483
01:46:03,732 --> 01:46:05,064
Da-hye.

1484
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:09,277
Do I fit in here?

1485
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:12,272
What?

1486
01:46:13,242 --> 01:46:16,076
In this setting, do I fit in?

1487
01:46:26,422 --> 01:46:28,414
Hey, where are you going?

1488
01:46:28,924 --> 01:46:30,290
I need to go down.

1489
01:46:30,551 --> 01:46:32,793
Just stay with me.

1490
01:46:33,929 --> 01:46:35,636
I need to go down there.

1491
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:40,885
Why go to those boring people?
Can't you stay here?

1492
01:46:41,854 --> 01:46:46,189
Not to those people, down lower.

1493
01:46:46,734 --> 01:46:49,226
Wow, what is that?

1494
01:46:52,489 --> 01:46:56,108
God, I can't believe
I'm doing this at my age.

1495
01:46:56,827 --> 01:46:58,693
It's so embarrassing.

1496
01:46:59,747 --> 01:47:01,454
I'm really sorry, Mr. Kim.

1497
01:47:01,624 --> 01:47:04,708
Da-song's mom insisted,
it can't be helped.

1498
01:47:04,919 --> 01:47:06,581
But the concept is simple.

1499
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:11,916
There'll be a parade with Jessica
carrying a birthday cake.

1500
01:47:12,009 --> 01:47:15,969
Then we jump out and attack Jessica.

1501
01:47:16,055 --> 01:47:18,092
Swinging our tomahawks!

1502
01:47:18,349 --> 01:47:19,307
Right.

1503
01:47:19,308 --> 01:47:24,269
Just then, Da-song the good Indian
will jump out and we'll do battle.

1504
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:29,270
Finally he'll save Jessica the cake princess,
and they'll all cheer.

1505
01:47:29,526 --> 01:47:31,142
Something like that.

1506
01:47:32,321 --> 01:47:33,321
Silly, isn't it?

1507
01:47:33,364 --> 01:47:38,155
I guess your wife likes events
and surprises.

1508
01:47:38,285 --> 01:47:39,947
Yeah, she does.

1509
01:47:40,371 --> 01:47:43,079
But she's particularly
into this party.

1510
01:47:44,750 --> 01:47:47,618
You're trying your best, too.

1511
01:47:48,921 --> 01:47:51,629
Well, you love her, after all.

1512
01:47:57,221 --> 01:47:58,553
Mr. Kim.

1513
01:48:00,265 --> 01:48:02,552
You're getting paid extra.

1514
01:48:08,023 --> 01:48:12,017
Think of this as part of your work,
okay?

1515
01:48:23,706 --> 01:48:25,197
Did you go down below?

1516
01:48:25,374 --> 01:48:29,163
- Not yet.
- Shouldn't we talk to them?

1517
01:48:29,253 --> 01:48:30,960
Reach an understanding?

1518
01:48:31,088 --> 01:48:32,169
Exactly!

1519
01:48:32,256 --> 01:48:34,839
We all got too fucking worked up
last night.

1520
01:48:34,925 --> 01:48:38,669
Dad was going on about some plan...

1521
01:48:39,346 --> 01:48:41,838
- I'm just going down there.
- Hold on.

1522
01:48:41,932 --> 01:48:44,174
Take this down to them.

1523
01:48:44,268 --> 01:48:45,884
- They must be hungry.
- Right.

1524
01:48:45,978 --> 01:48:47,560
Let them eat first.

1525
01:48:48,689 --> 01:48:50,555
Come next time for sure!

1526
01:48:52,151 --> 01:48:54,188
Here you are, Jessica.

1527
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:56,561
- This is so amazing.
- Isn't it great?

1528
01:48:56,739 --> 01:48:59,152
I've got a special favor to ask.

1529
01:48:59,283 --> 01:49:00,399
What is it?

1530
01:49:00,534 --> 01:49:02,821
This is... how to describe it?

1531
01:49:02,911 --> 01:49:04,868
Da-song's trauma recovery cake?

1532
01:49:04,955 --> 01:49:08,073
So it needs to be you who does it.
Today's highlight!

1533
01:50:31,125 --> 01:50:34,334
Hey, are you okay?

1534
01:50:39,716 --> 01:50:41,048
Are you...?

1535
01:50:50,978 --> 01:50:52,469
Wait, mister!

1536
01:52:39,419 --> 01:52:42,127
Kevin? Kevin!

1537
01:52:49,012 --> 01:52:51,846
Da-song, happy birthday!

1538
01:52:51,932 --> 01:52:53,218
Congratulations!

1539
01:53:00,649 --> 01:53:01,810
Shit...

1540
01:53:11,868 --> 01:53:13,325
<i>Stop!</i>

1541
01:53:13,870 --> 01:53:15,953
Chung-sook!

1542
01:53:16,039 --> 01:53:16,998
Ki-jung!

1543
01:53:16,999 --> 01:53:18,285
Come out here, Chung-sook!

1544
01:53:18,375 --> 01:53:21,914
Stop the blood! Push down
on the wound!

1545
01:53:26,758 --> 01:53:27,874
Da-song!

1546
01:53:28,593 --> 01:53:29,674
Honey!

1547
01:53:31,263 --> 01:53:33,095
Let go, don't!

1548
01:53:43,900 --> 01:53:45,266
It hurts.

1549
01:53:50,490 --> 01:53:51,526
The emergency room!

1550
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:52,857
Get the car!

1551
01:53:52,951 --> 01:53:54,863
Mr. Kim!
What are you doing?

1552
01:53:55,037 --> 01:53:57,029
We can't wait for an ambulance!

1553
01:53:57,122 --> 01:53:59,409
Stop pushing, Dad!

1554
01:53:59,583 --> 01:54:02,417
Makes it hurt more.

1555
01:54:03,170 --> 01:54:04,377
Car keys!
The car keys!

1556
01:54:04,463 --> 01:54:06,955
Throw them!
Throw me the keys!

1557
01:54:24,858 --> 01:54:26,190
Are you okay?

1558
01:54:26,735 --> 01:54:28,192
Don't touch it!

1559
01:54:30,697 --> 01:54:32,984
Hello, Mr. Park.

1560
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:34,361
You know me?

1561
01:54:34,451 --> 01:54:35,783
Respect!

1562
01:56:02,747 --> 01:56:06,115
<i>Opening my eyes for the first time
in a month,</i>

1563
01:56:06,209 --> 01:56:07,791
<i>I saw a detective.</i>

1564
01:56:08,086 --> 01:56:12,877
You have the right to
an attorney...

1565
01:56:12,966 --> 01:56:15,083
<i>Who looked nothing like
a detective.</i>

1566
01:56:19,556 --> 01:56:21,218
Is he laughing?

1567
01:56:21,641 --> 01:56:23,098
Just a sec.

1568
01:56:23,685 --> 01:56:28,146
<i>Then the doctor who looked
nothing like a doctor spoke.</i>

1569
01:56:29,524 --> 01:56:33,234
That happens sometimes
after brain surgery.

1570
01:56:33,445 --> 01:56:35,311
They keep laughing.
For no reason.

1571
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:38,322
Do you hear me?

1572
01:56:38,742 --> 01:56:40,449
Can you hear me?

1573
01:56:40,744 --> 01:56:42,485
Then do I have to do it again?

1574
01:56:42,621 --> 01:56:43,537
Do what?

1575
01:56:43,538 --> 01:56:45,074
The Miranda thing.

1576
01:56:47,334 --> 01:56:51,669
You have the right to remain silent.

1577
01:56:51,755 --> 01:56:54,372
Anything you say can and
will be used against you...

1578
01:56:54,466 --> 01:56:56,378
He keeps laughing, look!

1579
01:56:59,763 --> 01:57:05,600
<i>Even when I heard
how much Ki-jung bled that day...</i>

1580
01:57:08,021 --> 01:57:15,021
<i>Even when I heard the words forgery,
trespassing, foul play, self-defense</i>

1581
01:57:15,529 --> 01:57:19,648
<i>and we were lucky
to get away with a probation...</i>

1582
01:57:22,869 --> 01:57:26,033
<i>Even when I finally
got to see Ki-jung's face...</i>

1583
01:57:26,122 --> 01:57:28,739
<i>Kim Ki-jung, RIP</i>

1584
01:57:30,460 --> 01:57:32,577
<i>I kept laughing.</i>

1585
01:57:42,556 --> 01:57:47,802
<i>Still, when I went back
and watched the news reports,</i>

1586
01:57:48,144 --> 01:57:49,555
<i>I didn't laugh.</i>

1587
01:57:49,604 --> 01:57:53,473
This sudden rampage in the back yard
of an upper-class home

1588
01:57:53,567 --> 01:57:55,183
is a highly unusual case.

1589
01:57:55,277 --> 01:57:59,772
Since the homeless man who sparked
the rampage died at the scene,

1590
01:57:59,864 --> 01:58:05,110
police are struggling to
even establish a clear motive.

1591
01:58:05,203 --> 01:58:09,698
The driver Kim and the slain Mr. Park
are said to have been on good terms.

1592
01:58:09,833 --> 01:58:15,170
For now the police investigation is
focused on locating the driver Kim.

1593
01:58:15,714 --> 01:58:19,503
Kim, after exiting this door
and descending the stairs,

1594
01:58:19,801 --> 01:58:22,919
disappeared into the neighboring alleys.

1595
01:58:23,722 --> 01:58:28,717
Police searched the CCTVs
of nearby homes to no avail,

1596
01:58:29,185 --> 01:58:32,349
and they have yet
to find any witnesses.

1597
01:58:32,897 --> 01:58:35,014
Given the situation,

1598
01:58:35,233 --> 01:58:40,149
it's not an exaggeration to say that
Kim vanished into thin air.

1599
01:58:41,615 --> 01:58:48,579
<i>Actually Mom and I had no idea
where Dad was.</i>

1600
01:58:50,915 --> 01:58:56,286
<i>But those detectives
still wore themselves out tailing us.</i>

1601
01:59:00,425 --> 01:59:04,135
<i>Eventually the news went quiet,</i>

1602
01:59:04,137 --> 01:59:06,254
<i>and after the tails stopped,</i>

1603
01:59:07,057 --> 01:59:10,221
<i>I started going up that mountain.</i>

1604
01:59:12,479 --> 01:59:16,940
<i>From up there,
you get a great view of the house.</i>

1605
01:59:19,986 --> 01:59:23,696
<i>That day, despite the cold,</i>

1606
01:59:24,574 --> 01:59:27,112
<i>I felt like staying longer.</i>

1607
01:59:40,215 --> 01:59:43,253
Dash-dash-dot-dot

1608
02:00:09,035 --> 02:00:10,321
Son!

1609
02:00:12,414 --> 02:00:13,655
<i>Son!</i>

1610
02:00:15,917 --> 02:00:19,331
<i>Perhaps you, if no one else,
will be able to read this letter.</i>

1611
02:00:23,007 --> 02:00:25,590
<i>You were a Boy Scout,</i>

1612
02:00:25,593 --> 02:00:29,052
<i>so I'm writing this just
in case.</i>

1613
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:35,183
<i>Have your injuries healed?</i>

1614
02:00:36,438 --> 02:00:40,523
<i>I'm sure your mom is
plenty healthy.</i>

1615
02:00:44,654 --> 02:00:47,317
<i>I'm doing fine in here.</i>

1616
02:00:48,533 --> 02:00:51,116
<i>Though thinking of
Ki-jung makes me cry.</i>

1617
02:00:54,581 --> 02:00:58,951
<i>Even now, what happened that day
doesn't seem real.</i>

1618
02:01:00,462 --> 02:01:02,499
<i>It feels like a dream,</i>

1619
02:01:03,798 --> 02:01:05,380
<i>and yet it doesn't.</i>

1620
02:01:06,885 --> 02:01:11,220
<i>That day as I went out the gate,
I suddenly knew.</i>

1621
02:01:12,599 --> 02:01:14,386
<i>Where I needed to go...</i>

1622
02:01:54,015 --> 02:01:57,008
<i>A house where such
a grisly crime took place</i>

1623
02:01:57,143 --> 02:01:59,931
<i>would surely not be easy
to sell.</i>

1624
02:02:03,483 --> 02:02:05,850
I'm sorry, Mr. Park.

1625
02:02:06,027 --> 02:02:12,115
<i>I struggled to hold out like that
in an empty house.</i>

1626
02:02:15,036 --> 02:02:17,949
<i>Still, thanks to the house
being empty,</i>

1627
02:02:18,122 --> 02:02:22,913
<i>what was her name?
Moon-gwang?</i>

1628
02:02:23,127 --> 02:02:26,916
<i>I was able to give her
a proper send off.</i>

1629
02:02:28,508 --> 02:02:34,721
<i>I hear tree-side burials are trendy,
so hell, I did my best.</i>

1630
02:02:38,476 --> 02:02:42,015
<i>But those real estate
sharks sure are clever.</i>

1631
02:02:46,651 --> 02:02:51,112
<i>They hoodwinked some people
who hadjust arrived in Korea</i>

1632
02:02:51,197 --> 02:02:53,405
<i>and managed to sell the house.</i>

1633
02:02:54,617 --> 02:02:57,860
<i>With the parents working,
and the kids attending school,</i>

1634
02:02:57,954 --> 02:03:00,241
<i>the family is usually out.</i>

1635
02:03:00,707 --> 02:03:05,827
<i>But the goddamned housekeeper
stays there 24 hours a day.</i>

1636
02:03:06,296 --> 02:03:10,916
<i>Each time I go upstairs,
I take my life in my hands.</i>

1637
02:03:13,720 --> 02:03:17,805
<i>It turns out Germans eat
more than just sausage and beer.</i>

1638
02:03:18,474 --> 02:03:20,340
<i>What a relief.</i>

1639
02:03:23,229 --> 02:03:27,064
<i>Passing the time down here,
everything starts to go hazy.</i>

1640
02:03:31,863 --> 02:03:35,982
<i>Today at least I was able
to write you a letter.</i>

1641
02:03:37,869 --> 02:03:41,863
<i>If I send out the letter
this way every night,</i>

1642
02:03:41,956 --> 02:03:45,996
<i>maybe someday you'll see it.</i>

1643
02:03:52,175 --> 02:03:53,837
<i>So long.</i>

1644
02:04:07,899 --> 02:04:09,140
You're home, Ki-woo?

1645
02:04:09,233 --> 02:04:10,233
Yeah.

1646
02:04:24,499 --> 02:04:29,164
<i>Dad, today I made a plan.</i>

1647
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:32,792
<i>A fundamental plan.</i>

1648
02:04:35,885 --> 02:04:37,717
<i>I'm going to earn money.</i>

1649
02:04:38,471 --> 02:04:40,087
<i>A lot of it.</i>

1650
02:04:43,476 --> 02:04:47,891
<i>University, a career, marriage,
those are all fine,</i>

1651
02:04:48,398 --> 02:04:50,355
<i>but first I'll earn money.</i>

1652
02:04:50,483 --> 02:04:55,524
You'll see once you go in,
but it's very spacious.

1653
02:04:56,447 --> 02:05:00,942
Actually, we don't show this house
to just anyone.

1654
02:05:01,327 --> 02:05:05,367
<i>When I have money,
I'll buy that house.</i>

1655
02:05:06,624 --> 02:05:10,834
<i>On the day we move in,
Mom and I will be in the yard.</i>

1656
02:05:11,462 --> 02:05:13,795
<i>Because the sunshine is
so nice there.</i>

1657
02:05:15,133 --> 02:05:16,965
<i>All you'll need to do</i>

1658
02:05:17,385 --> 02:05:19,718
<i>is walk up the stairs.</i>

1659
02:06:42,929 --> 02:06:46,548
<i>Take care until then.</i>

1660
02:06:51,729 --> 02:06:53,391
<i>So long.</i>
