1
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,972
WERNER HERZOG These images taken
under the ice of the Ross Sea in Antarctica

2
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:26,312
were the reason
I wanted to go to this continent

3
00:01:26,354 --> 00:01:35,447
The pictures were taken by a friend of mine,
one of these expert divers

4
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,473
The best connection is on
military planes out of New Zealand,

5
00:02:37,514 --> 00:02:44,313
loaded with chained-down parts
of polar stations

6
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:52,739
Most of the passengers had tucked
into their laptops and their books,

7
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:57,786
and many of them were sleeping

8
00:02:59,204 --> 00:03:05,670
Who were the people I was going to meet
in Antarctica at the end of the world?

9
00:03:05,712 --> 00:03:10,008
What were their dreams?

10
00:03:14,554 --> 00:03:20,686
We flew into the unknown,
a seemingly endless void

11
00:03:20,728 --> 00:03:25,108
I was surprised that
I was even on this plane

12
00:03:25,149 --> 00:03:29,112
The National Science Foundation
had invited me to Antarctica,

13
00:03:29,154 --> 00:03:32,699
even though I left no doubt
that I would not come up

14
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:36,787
with another film about penguins

15
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:43,586
My questions about nature,
I let them know, were different

16
00:03:43,628 --> 00:03:46,005
I told them I kept wondering

17
00:03:46,047 --> 00:03:53,639
why is it that human beings put on
masks or feathers to conceal their identity?

18
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:01,814
And why do they saddle horses
and feel the urge to chase the bad guy?

19
00:04:01,856 --> 00:04:05,276
Hi-yo, Silver!

20
00:04:06,194 --> 00:04:13,243
HERZOG And why is it that certain species
of ants keep flocks of plant lice as slaves

21
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:17,790
to milk them for droplets of sugar?

22
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:22,628
I asked them why is it
that a sophisticated animal like a chimp

23
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:27,133
does not utilize inferior creatures?

24
00:04:27,175 --> 00:04:34,475
He could straddle a goat
and ride off into the sunset

25
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:51,618
Despite my odd questions, I found myself
landing on the ice runway at McMurdo

26
00:04:52,494 --> 00:04:58,042
For most of the austral spring and summer,
which lasts from October through February,

27
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:04,132
planes can land on
the 8-foot thick ice of the Ross Sea

28
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:09,679
In the distance,
the mountains of the Transantarctic range

29
00:05:09,721 --> 00:05:14,727
McMurdo itself is situated on an island

30
00:05:14,768 --> 00:05:18,898
The Ross Sea is the largest bay
in the continent

31
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:26,156
This bay alone covers the size
of the state of Texas

32
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,628
On this very same frozen ocean,

33
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:44,759
the early explorer's ship
got wedged into moving ice flows

34
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:48,805
Here, Shackleton's expedition
evacuates their vessel,

35
00:05:48,847 --> 00:05:56,730
which would later come to ruin,
leaving them stranded there

36
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:08,076
Everything in this expedition was doomed,

37
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:12,080
including the first ancestor
of the snowmobile

38
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:19,005
The idea was too big for
the technical possibilities 100 years ago

39
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:26,054
At that time,
every step meant incredible hardship

40
00:06:41,654 --> 00:06:44,908
The first thing that caught my eye
upon landing

41
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:50,539
was the humongous bus and its driver

42
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:06,348
- We're clearing the apron now, thank you
- MAN Hey, you're welcome

43
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:12,062
This is lvan the Terra Bus
It's one of seven in the world,

44
00:07:12,104 --> 00:07:17,151
weighs 67,000 pounds
and is the largest vehicle on the continent

45
00:07:17,193 --> 00:07:20,196
HERZOG: What do you do when you are
back home? Are you a taxi driver?

46
00:07:20,238 --> 00:07:22,490
I am not a taxi driver at home

47
00:07:22,532 --> 00:07:26,203
Before I came to Antarctica,
I was actually a banker in Colorado

48
00:07:26,244 --> 00:07:29,790
And after two years there,
I changed my pace a little bit

49
00:07:29,832 --> 00:07:32,668
and decided to help
the people of Guatemala,

50
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:38,257
so I joined the Peace Corps, and there
I worked in small business development

51
00:07:38,299 --> 00:07:41,386
Just realized that the world's
not all about money

52
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:43,763
ROWLAND Where I lived in Guatemala
was in the northern part

53
00:07:43,805 --> 00:07:50,771
It's a Kekchi Mayan village, 99% Mayan,
and therefore nobody spoke Spanish

54
00:07:50,813 --> 00:07:55,318
I had to learn the Mayan dialect, Kekchi

55
00:07:55,359 --> 00:08:00,198
When I first moved to Chisec, I was just out
on a normal walk, and before I knew it

56
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,327
I had six people with machetes
chasing me down, wanting to talk to me

57
00:08:04,369 --> 00:08:08,332
Turns out the little brother
told them I was there to steal children

58
00:08:08,373 --> 00:08:11,585
I was, however, not there to steal children

59
00:08:11,627 --> 00:08:16,257
They took me back to my My judge
and jury was the 14-year-old boy in the town

60
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:19,636
who could speak both Spanish and Kekchi

61
00:08:19,677 --> 00:08:21,596
Luckily, they let me go,

62
00:08:21,638 --> 00:08:25,434
and we ended up being
great friends over the two years

63
00:08:25,475 --> 00:08:30,522
- HERZOG: The jury acquitted you
- I was acquitted I made it out of there

64
00:08:30,564 --> 00:08:31,941
But it could have been dangerous

65
00:08:31,982 --> 00:08:35,945
It is, it is
And, you know, a story not too long ago is,

66
00:08:35,987 --> 00:08:38,114
a lady was just taking a picture of a child,

67
00:08:38,156 --> 00:08:42,911
you know, the same type of group of people
with machetes, and she wasn't so fortunate

68
00:08:42,953 --> 00:08:45,580
- She didn't make it out
- What happened to her?

69
00:08:45,622 --> 00:08:50,419
She was killed, by a machete

70
00:08:51,587 --> 00:08:55,883
HERZOG Approaching McMurdo Station,
the largest American base,

71
00:08:55,925 --> 00:08:59,804
in fact the largest settlement in Antarctica

72
00:08:59,846 --> 00:09:04,851
Right there is Captain Scott's hut,
built in 1902

73
00:09:04,893 --> 00:09:06,436
HERZOG During the austral summer,

74
00:09:06,478 --> 00:09:11,942
about 1,000 people live here
experiencing a strange state,

75
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:16,698
five months of no nighttime

76
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,452
McMurdo serves as a logistical hub

77
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:25,707
and provides fixed laboratory facilities
for research

78
00:09:25,749 --> 00:09:28,627
All the decisions about scientific projects

79
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:33,966
are the domain of my host,
the National Science Foundation

80
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:39,389
Day to day logistics
are run by a defense contractor

81
00:09:39,431 --> 00:09:43,185
I had been told by some
disgruntled former inhabitants

82
00:09:43,226 --> 00:09:50,317
that they ran things
in the spirit of a correctional facility

83
00:09:50,359 --> 00:09:59,035
Actually, they were decent people,
just too concerned for my personal safety

84
00:09:59,077 --> 00:10:03,040
Of course, I did not expect
pristine landscapes

85
00:10:03,081 --> 00:10:07,378
and men living in blissful harmony
with fluffy penguins,

86
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:12,717
but I was still surprised to find McMurdo
looking like an ugly mining town

87
00:10:12,758 --> 00:10:20,058
filled with Caterpillars
and noisy construction sites

88
00:10:53,094 --> 00:10:56,347
Who are the people
who drive the heavy machinery,

89
00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:00,352
and what brought them to Antarctica?

90
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:08,110
(LAUGHING) It's a long story
I've explored many different

91
00:11:08,611 --> 00:11:14,367
lands of the mind and many worlds of ideas,

92
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:18,204
and I started before I even knew
how to read and write

93
00:11:18,246 --> 00:11:21,708
My grandmother was reading
The Odyssey and The Iliad to me,

94
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:26,130
so I started my journey in my fantasy,

95
00:11:26,171 --> 00:11:29,133
before I even knew the means

96
00:11:29,175 --> 00:11:33,137
of accomplishing it, but my mind
and my psyche was ready for it

97
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:38,018
I was already traveling with Odysseus
and with the Argonauts

98
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:43,023
and to those strange and amazing lands,
and that always stayed with me,

99
00:11:43,065 --> 00:11:48,028
that fascination of the world,
and that I fell in love with the world

100
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:54,828
And it's been very powerful
and has been with me this whole time

101
00:11:54,869 --> 00:11:58,498
HERZOG: And how does it happen that
we are encountering each other here

102
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,959
at the end of the world?

103
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:06,090
I think that it's a logical place to find
each other because this place works

104
00:12:06,131 --> 00:12:11,596
almost as a natural selection for people that

105
00:12:11,637 --> 00:12:14,724
have this intention to jump
off the margin of the map,

106
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:19,855
and we all meet here where
all the lines of the map converge

107
00:12:19,896 --> 00:12:25,778
PASHO V There is no point that is
south of the South Pole

108
00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:30,074
And I think there is a fair amount
of the population here

109
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:34,537
which are full-time travelers
and part-time workers

110
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:36,498
So yes, those are the professional dreamers

111
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:41,628
They dream all the time,
and, I think, through them

112
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:45,800
the great cosmic dreams come into fruition,

113
00:12:45,841 --> 00:12:49,762
because the universe dreams
through our dreams,

114
00:12:49,804 --> 00:12:54,142
and I think that there is

115
00:12:54,184 --> 00:12:57,062
many different ways for the reality

116
00:12:57,103 --> 00:13:05,988
to bring itself forward, and dreaming
is definitely one of those ways

117
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:03,634
HERZOG As banal as McMurdo appears,

118
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:09,807
it turns out it is filled
with these professional dreamers

119
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:13,520
At night, I was laying
in my bed here in McMurdo

120
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:19,026
I am again walking across the top of B-15

121
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,654
Might as well be
on a piece of the South Pole,

122
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,533
but yet I'm actually adrift in the ocean,

123
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:30,246
a vagabond floating in the ocean,
and below my feet

124
00:14:30,288 --> 00:14:33,041
I can feel the rumble of the iceberg

125
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:36,628
I can feel the change, the cry of the iceberg

126
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:40,257
as it's screeching
and as it's bouncing off the seabed,

127
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:44,303
as it's steering the ocean currents,
as it's beginning to move north

128
00:14:44,345 --> 00:14:49,225
I can feel that sound coming up
through the bottoms of my feet

129
00:14:49,267 --> 00:14:57,651
and telling me that this iceberg
is coming north That's my dream

130
00:15:06,702 --> 00:15:12,208
So here I'm sitting in this lovely warm lab
and just outside is the environment

131
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:17,506
that Scott and Shackleton first faced
when they came here about 100 years ago

132
00:15:17,548 --> 00:15:23,095
Unlike Scott and Shackleton, who viewed
the ice as this sort of static monster

133
00:15:23,137 --> 00:15:26,224
that had to be crossed
to get to the South Pole,

134
00:15:26,265 --> 00:15:31,104
we scientists now are able to
see the ice as a dynamic living entity

135
00:15:31,146 --> 00:15:37,444
that is sort of producing change,
like the icebergs that I study

136
00:15:37,486 --> 00:15:39,738
For me, it's been a wild ride

137
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:44,243
First of all, I found out that the iceberg
that I came down to study

138
00:15:44,285 --> 00:15:48,498
not only was larger than the iceberg
that sank the Titanic,

139
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,043
it was not only larger than the Titanic itself,

140
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:55,631
but it was larger than the country
that built the Titanic

141
00:15:55,672 --> 00:15:57,841
That's pretty big

142
00:15:57,883 --> 00:16:04,682
This is B-15 So what we see here
is the white cliff It's about 150 feet tall,

143
00:16:04,724 --> 00:16:10,063
so that means that there's over
1,000 feet of ice below the water line

144
00:16:10,105 --> 00:16:14,359
This iceberg is so big
that the water that it contains

145
00:16:14,401 --> 00:16:19,949
would run the flow of
the river Jordan for 1,000 years

146
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:30,377
It's so big that the water that is inside of it
would run the river Nile for 75 years

147
00:16:30,418 --> 00:16:32,504
MacAYEAL This is a little bit
of video that we shot

148
00:16:32,546 --> 00:16:34,840
when we were flying up to the iceberg

149
00:16:34,882 --> 00:16:38,594
It looks big and it looms above us,
even if we're on an aircraft

150
00:16:38,636 --> 00:16:42,932
flying above the iceberg,
the iceberg is always above us

151
00:16:42,974 --> 00:16:47,979
It's above us because it's a mystery
that we don't understand

152
00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:52,484
Here's a picture of what it looked like once
we had arrived in the center of the iceberg

153
00:16:52,526 --> 00:16:54,319
We put out our instruments

154
00:16:54,361 --> 00:16:59,992
Now we're gonna have an opportunity
to monitor how the iceberg drifts north

155
00:17:00,034 --> 00:17:03,621
They're so big, there's an element of fear

156
00:17:03,663 --> 00:17:06,040
We don't know, really,
what's going to come ahead

157
00:17:06,082 --> 00:17:12,339
when they eventually begin to melt
in the ocean beyond Antarctica

158
00:17:12,381 --> 00:17:17,845
What we're seeing now here
is a time-lapse sort of animation

159
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:22,433
of satellite imagery of the sea ice
and of the continent of Antarctica

160
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:25,144
And what you see are three shades of gray

161
00:17:25,186 --> 00:17:28,231
This sort of lighter shade of gray
is the sea ice,

162
00:17:28,273 --> 00:17:32,945
and these little bits and pieces here,
these are titanic icebergs

163
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:38,075
This little fellow right here, he's not a very
big iceberg compared to these other ones,

164
00:17:38,117 --> 00:17:43,331
but that guy there might be the size of
the island of Sicily in the Mediterranean

165
00:17:43,373 --> 00:17:47,001
It's like a little tiny bumblebee
zipping around in a circle,

166
00:17:47,043 --> 00:17:52,049
happy to be in the warm waters
as it's drifting north

167
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:58,472
I'd be happy to see Antarctica as a static,
monolithic environment,

168
00:17:58,514 --> 00:18:04,145
a cold monolith of ice, sort of the way
the people back in the past used to see it,

169
00:18:04,187 --> 00:18:08,733
but now our comfortable thought
about Antarctica is over

170
00:18:08,775 --> 00:18:12,487
Now we're seeing it as
a living being that's dynamic,

171
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:18,577
that's producing change, change that
it's broadcasting to the rest of the world,

172
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:23,708
possibly in response to what the world
is broadcasting down to Antarctica

173
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,545
Certainly on a gut level
it's going to be frightening

174
00:18:27,587 --> 00:18:35,304
to watch what happens
to these babies once they get north

175
00:18:44,481 --> 00:18:48,819
HERZOG What environment would the men
of Shackleton's expedition encounter

176
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:54,074
if they returned in a next life?

177
00:18:55,826 --> 00:18:59,747
Shackleton, seen here,
would finally make it to the Pole,

178
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:05,837
a quest he had to abandon
a mere 100 miles short of it

179
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:08,507
Would there be any ice left?

180
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:12,803
Would he have to construct
an artificial Antarctica in a studio

181
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:20,436
and try to find his route through
papier-mache icebergs?

182
00:19:27,778 --> 00:19:33,367
Would our only modern recourse
be to create ice with machines?

183
00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:36,162
This is Frosty Boy, here in McMurdo

184
00:19:36,203 --> 00:19:39,874
It's the equivalent of ice cream in the States,
and it's a really big hit

185
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:45,088
Everybody loves it It's what they go for
three or four times a day

186
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:50,177
And it has the texture of ice cream,
but it's not quite ice cream

187
00:19:50,219 --> 00:19:56,600
There's a lot of crises that happen
in McMurdo when the Frosty Boy runs out

188
00:19:56,642 --> 00:19:57,977
It's bad news

189
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:04,359
Words circulate everywhere throughout
McMurdo when Frosty Boy goes down

190
00:20:04,401 --> 00:20:07,988
It's really good stuff

191
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:13,828
HERZOG From the very first day,
we just wanted to get out of this place

192
00:20:13,869 --> 00:20:19,625
McMurdo has climate-controlled housing
facilities, its own radio station,

193
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:28,093
a bowling alley and abominations
such as an aerobic studio and yoga classes

194
00:20:28,135 --> 00:20:32,389
It even has an ATM machine

195
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:42,150
For all these reasons, I wanted to get out
into the field as soon as possible

196
00:20:42,192 --> 00:20:47,406
But before we could do that, it is mandatory
that every inhabitant of McMurdo

197
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:54,663
attend survival school
before being allowed to leave

198
00:20:56,457 --> 00:21:02,839
This two-day exercise
is called Happy Camper

199
00:21:10,806 --> 00:21:15,686
Students learn to build
survival trenches and igloos

200
00:21:15,728 --> 00:21:20,817
The bad news is, that night
you have to sleep in your own construction

201
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:30,160
As long as I end up with 10 fingers
and 10 toes at the end, it's all good

202
00:21:39,587 --> 00:21:41,131
Oh, God, sorry!

203
00:21:41,172 --> 00:21:44,301
We just need to break ourselves
into two different groups now

204
00:21:44,342 --> 00:21:49,890
We're gonna brief this group over here
for the burning vehicle scenario first,

205
00:21:49,932 --> 00:21:52,643
then we're gonna come back over
and we're gonna brief

206
00:21:52,685 --> 00:21:56,147
the bucket head white-out scenario
for everybody else

207
00:21:56,189 --> 00:22:00,944
Essentially, we're trying to create conditions
where we wouldn't be able to see

208
00:22:00,985 --> 00:22:06,533
The wind is so severe, the snow is blowing
so severely Very, very cold

209
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:11,872
Exposed skin might actually
create frostbite instantaneously

210
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:15,668
The winds are so severe
you could be blown off of your stance

211
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:20,548
of just simply standing out,
and visibility is pretty much none

212
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,217
You can't see flag to flag

213
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:25,762
You might not be able to see your hand
in front of your own face

214
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:29,516
Therefore,
what we're gonna do as a simulator

215
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:35,356
is incorporate a bucket to simulate
a white-out condition

216
00:22:35,398 --> 00:22:38,651
to a point where I can barely hear myself

217
00:22:38,693 --> 00:22:47,953
You can't necessarily even hear me, and
I certainly can't see any of you right now

218
00:22:47,995 --> 00:22:50,247
So that's the whole idea
behind the bucket head

219
00:22:50,289 --> 00:22:55,712
is to actually be a white-out simulator,
and it works really quite well

220
00:22:55,753 --> 00:22:59,049
So, some of the parameters
for this are gonna be,

221
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,593
we're gonna start inside the sea-ice hut

222
00:23:01,635 --> 00:23:03,762
I said I was gonna go to the bathroom,
and in fact I did

223
00:23:03,804 --> 00:23:07,474
I needed to go to the bathroom, right
So, I've gone out

224
00:23:07,516 --> 00:23:09,894
I've been gone for
quite some time now though,

225
00:23:09,935 --> 00:23:13,731
you know, like 10, 15
All of a sudden 20 minutes, you're like,

226
00:23:13,773 --> 00:23:17,485
"First off, where's the chocolate,
second off, where's Kevin?"

227
00:23:17,527 --> 00:23:20,488
- EMERY: Are you with us, Number One?
- Number One is out

228
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:25,536
HERZOG The goal is clear,
to find the instructor next to the outhouse

229
00:23:25,577 --> 00:23:27,997
Number Two is out

230
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:30,958
Number Three out Number Three out

231
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,253
EMERY: All right, Number One, you're
gonna have to walk in one simple direction,

232
00:23:34,295 --> 00:23:37,048
and I'm gonna keep the
Pull on one rope for me

233
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,758
Four out

234
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,180
HERZOG It looks pretty good They seem
to be heading in the right direction

235
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:45,224
Five out

236
00:23:45,265 --> 00:23:46,934
Six out

237
00:23:46,976 --> 00:23:56,569
But very soon the front man veers
off-course, pulling everyone else with him

238
00:24:15,006 --> 00:24:17,926
- Pull the rope, somebody
- THREE: Hey, anybody out there?

239
00:24:17,968 --> 00:24:21,930
Out here Number Three is here

240
00:24:21,972 --> 00:24:27,853
- Where you at, Number Two?
- Find him?

241
00:24:55,425 --> 00:25:00,138
- Did we find the guy?
- No

242
00:25:03,726 --> 00:25:04,893
ONE: Okay, I think we're gonna go this way

243
00:25:04,935 --> 00:25:09,649
Follow me this way, guys This way, guys

244
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:12,735
Hold on, hold on

245
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:15,447
So part of what we want to do here
as an educational opportunity

246
00:25:15,488 --> 00:25:17,657
is see if they realize what they've done,

247
00:25:17,699 --> 00:25:20,410
come back to a hut
and come up with a new game plan,

248
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:24,665
or if they just keep going down
that cascading error phenomenon,

249
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:26,834
where one mistake
leads into another mistake

250
00:25:26,876 --> 00:25:30,213
which leads into a third,
and it just gets really bad

251
00:25:30,254 --> 00:25:32,048
Who's pulling on this line?

252
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,508
- Me
- Number One

253
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:36,636
Number One, don't pull on that
That's the line going back to the hut

254
00:25:36,678 --> 00:25:39,431
- I got the end
- Okay, back to the hut?

255
00:25:39,473 --> 00:25:41,016
- Back to the hut
- Back to the hut

256
00:25:41,058 --> 00:25:43,894
Back to the hut

257
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:46,564
HERZOG But rather than
pulling everyone in,

258
00:25:46,605 --> 00:25:48,858
last man first along the rope,

259
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:52,403
they drift completely off-course

260
00:25:52,445 --> 00:25:56,116
- Number Two is here Is Number Three here?
- Number Three is here

261
00:25:56,157 --> 00:25:58,744
Number Four?

262
00:25:58,785 --> 00:26:02,539
- Towards the sun
- No, not towards the sun

263
00:26:02,581 --> 00:26:04,708
- Left
- We need to go left

264
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,669
Left, stay left

265
00:26:06,711 --> 00:26:10,465
We don't know where he's standing though,
so left might be different for him

266
00:26:10,506 --> 00:26:12,217
- Correct
- Number Two

267
00:26:12,258 --> 00:26:14,219
- Okay, Number One
- I'm here

268
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:20,934
HERZOG For most of our time here,
we had postcard-pretty weather conditions

269
00:26:20,976 --> 00:26:29,444
This was frustrating because I loathe
the sun both on my celluloid and my skin

270
00:26:29,485 --> 00:26:39,580
So it almost came as a relief when a few
days later, the weather suddenly changed

271
00:26:48,339 --> 00:26:56,807
The storm soon broke and we were allowed
to venture out of McMurdo for the first time

272
00:26:56,848 --> 00:27:05,066
We set out on snowmobiles, in front of us
miles and miles of frozen ocean

273
00:27:05,107 --> 00:27:13,617
We were heading toward a field camp
of scientists who study seals

274
00:27:14,034 --> 00:27:15,994
It was amazing to consider

275
00:27:16,036 --> 00:27:24,128
that a mere six feet under us
was the expanse of the Ross Sea

276
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:21,816
These scientists here
are particularly interested

277
00:28:21,857 --> 00:28:25,570
in the feeding cycle of the Weddell seal

278
00:28:25,611 --> 00:28:27,822
In just a few short weeks,

279
00:28:27,864 --> 00:28:36,582
pups grow rapidly, while mothers lose
some 40% of their body weight

280
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:52,808
Bagging the seal's head keeps the animal
calm as the scientists extract a milk sample

281
00:28:52,849 --> 00:28:56,270
(SEAL WAILING)

282
00:29:07,365 --> 00:29:11,119
OFTEDAL Well, this really is quite
a wonderful group of animals to work on

283
00:29:11,161 --> 00:29:14,373
Weddell seals in particular,
you can see they're very big

284
00:29:14,414 --> 00:29:18,002
They're very strong,
and yet they allow us to work with them

285
00:29:18,043 --> 00:29:21,046
They're not very aggressive,
nor are they very timid

286
00:29:21,088 --> 00:29:25,551
Even though they struggle somewhat
when you have them in a bag or in a net,

287
00:29:25,593 --> 00:29:27,762
when you release them, they lie down

288
00:29:27,804 --> 00:29:30,765
There's the mother behind us
who we just worked on,

289
00:29:30,807 --> 00:29:32,559
and she's just lying quietly with her pup

290
00:29:32,601 --> 00:29:35,646
We've had pups start to nurse within
a couple of minutes of releasing them

291
00:29:35,687 --> 00:29:40,693
So even though they are a bit perturbed
at being handled,

292
00:29:40,735 --> 00:29:44,405
they recover very quickly from it
and seem to behave normally after that,

293
00:29:44,447 --> 00:29:49,703
and really that's the ideal for us is to have
an animal species that we can work on

294
00:29:49,744 --> 00:29:54,583
that will not be so disturbed by the work
that's being done on them

295
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:55,876
that they behave abnormally,

296
00:29:55,918 --> 00:30:04,218
'cause we want to know how these
animals survive, under these conditions

297
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,847
HERZOG In a field laboratory
adjacent to the colony,

298
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,058
they prepare the milk samples

299
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,396
that may ultimately provide insight
into human weight loss

300
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:19,860
This was just collected It's still warm
from the animal So if you see that

301
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:21,904
See, it's like, you know,
it's almost like pouring wax

302
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:27,160
It's really something else And if I let this
cool down, it would get pretty pasty

303
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:32,541
I wouldn't be able to pour it like that at all
It's at body temperature right now

304
00:30:32,582 --> 00:30:35,878
The milk of the Weddell seal
is about 45 fat

305
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:41,217
It's about 60 dry matter, 65 dry matter

306
00:30:41,259 --> 00:30:42,552
It's very, very high in protein

307
00:30:42,593 --> 00:30:46,514
It's about 10 to 12 protein
and contains no lactose at all,

308
00:30:46,556 --> 00:30:48,892
which is very unusual

309
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:51,353
And there's many things
about this place that are very unusual,

310
00:30:51,395 --> 00:30:56,942
and one of the things that I find
very fascinating is how quiet it gets

311
00:30:56,984 --> 00:30:58,235
It's the quietest place

312
00:30:58,277 --> 00:31:01,239
When the wind is down,
when there's no wind,

313
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,866
it wakes you up in the middle of the night
because there's no wind,

314
00:31:03,908 --> 00:31:05,285
and there's no sound at all,

315
00:31:05,326 --> 00:31:08,246
and if you walk out on the ice,
you can hear your own heartbeat,

316
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,414
that's how still it is

317
00:31:09,456 --> 00:31:11,959
And you can hear the
You can hear the ice crack,

318
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,170
and it sounds like there's somebody walking
behind you, but it's just the ice

319
00:31:15,212 --> 00:31:19,091
It's sort of, you know,
these little stress cracks moving all the time,

320
00:31:19,133 --> 00:31:21,093
because we're actually,
right here we're on ocean

321
00:31:21,135 --> 00:31:25,348
We're not on solid ground, so
And you can hear the seals

322
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:28,101
You can hear the seals call,
and it's the most amazing sound

323
00:31:28,143 --> 00:31:30,771

a surface being solid,

00:31:54,004 --> 00:31:57,758
and you sort of think in your mind
that you're on land, and then all of a sudden

330
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,844
you'll hear the sound
coming up through the floor

- You'll hear the chucks and the whistles
- And the booms

And the booms that come which are the

333
00:32:05,266 --> 00:32:07,894
You realize there's
a whole world underneath you,

334
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:11,815
that seals are moving and competing
and fighting beneath you under the ice

He is part Apache

It's funny, but I'm revealing my hands
and they are very distinct,

342
00:33:57,346 --> 00:34:00,266
and I was told by my doctor
who operated me that

343
00:34:00,308 --> 00:34:04,688
it is from the Aztec
and the Inca's royal family

344
00:34:04,729 --> 00:34:11,195
An anthropologist told me that,
and one of our daughters is very similar,

And I can turn it around too,
if you wanna see it this way

It's very distinct, the line here,

348
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:25,627

it was from the royal family of the Indians

but in school I used to not reach
the chalkboard with this,

00:34:36,848 --> 00:34:39,851
so I used to point with this,
and they called my father in

and said that I was being a bad boy,

354
00:34:41,394 --> 00:34:44,147

85 kilometers over frozen ocean

We were heading from Ross Island
in the direction of mainland Antarctica

366
00:36:33,641 --> 00:36:36,603
The empty interior beyond these mountains

367

is larger in size than
continental North America

The vast majority of it is
covered in a layer of ice 9,000 feet thick

369
00:36:49,325 --> 00:36:51,202
We were heading for New Harbor,

370
00:36:51,243 --> 00:36:56,332
a diving camp
which lies on the coastline of the ocean

371

We were welcomed by my friend
Henry Kaiser, a musician and expert diver,

whose underwater footage
it was that brought me to this place

HERZOG: Sam Bowser,
this is a special day for you?

380
00:37:46,637 --> 00:37:48,848
Well, I think

381
00:37:48,889 --> 00:37:52,518
I think everyone should stop
when they've reached a point

382
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,022
where they've done
what they've wanted to do,

383
00:37:56,064 --> 00:37:59,484
and today is probably gonna be
my last Antarctic dive, I think

384
00:37:59,526 --> 00:38:00,694
I think we've accomplished what

385
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:04,406
At least, I've accomplished
what I've set out to do here,

386
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:10,329
and it's time to pass the ball off to
the next generation of biologists, I think

387
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:13,625
So, it is a bit of a special day

388
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:17,546
HERZOG I had heard that he was also
a great science fiction fan

389
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:21,216
The creatures that are down there
that are like science-fiction creatures,

390
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:27,390
they range in the way that they would
gobble you up from slime-type blobs,

391
00:38:27,431 --> 00:38:31,144
but creepier than classic
science-fiction blobs

392
00:38:31,185 --> 00:38:33,354
These would have long tendrils
that would ensnare you,

393
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:35,690
and as you tried to get away from them

394
00:38:35,732 --> 00:38:39,152
you'd just become more and more ensnared
by your own actions

395
00:38:39,194 --> 00:38:43,240
And then after you would be frustrated
and exhausted,

396
00:38:43,282 --> 00:38:47,787
then this creature would start to move in
and take you apart

397
00:38:47,828 --> 00:38:49,831
So that's one example
of one of the creatures

398
00:38:49,872 --> 00:38:54,085
Then there are other types of worm-type
things with horrible mandibles

399
00:38:54,127 --> 00:38:59,049
and jaws and just bits to rend your flesh

400
00:38:59,091 --> 00:39:03,595
It really is a violent,
horribly violent world that

401
00:39:03,637 --> 00:39:08,434
is obscure to us
because we're encased in neoprene,

402
00:39:08,476 --> 00:39:11,229
you know,
and we're much larger than that world

403
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:13,982
So it doesn't really affect us,
but if you were to shrink down,

404
00:39:14,023 --> 00:39:19,196
miniaturize into that world,
it'd be a horrible place to be Just horrible

405
00:39:19,237 --> 00:39:21,907
HERZOG: And this is a world
earlier than human beings

406
00:39:21,949 --> 00:39:25,619
Do you think that the human race
and other mammals

407
00:39:25,661 --> 00:39:31,000
fled in panic from the oceans
and crawled on solid land to get out of this?

408
00:39:31,042 --> 00:39:34,629
Yeah, I think undoubtedly
that's exactly the driving force

409
00:39:34,671 --> 00:39:37,758
that caused us to leave the horrors behind

410
00:39:37,799 --> 00:39:41,136
To grow and evolve into larger creatures
to escape

411
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:47,977
what's horribly violent
at the miniature scale, miniaturized scale

412
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:50,438
Yeah

413
00:39:56,361 --> 00:40:04,078
HERZOG The water under the ice is
minus 2 degrees Celsius

414
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:09,834
That keeps us insulated from the cold

415
00:40:17,759 --> 00:40:18,844
Want me to open it up?

416
00:40:18,886 --> 00:40:22,890
- Yeah Ready?
- Yeah

417
00:40:37,489 --> 00:40:41,535
Dive operation Time right now is

418
00:40:41,577 --> 00:40:47,458
I'll give you a call back at about 2:30

419
00:40:53,673 --> 00:40:59,638
To me, the divers look like astronauts
floating in space

420
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,309
But their work is extremely dangerous

421
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:09,816
They are diving without tethers
to give them more free range

422
00:41:09,858 --> 00:41:12,360
But here you can't trust a compass

423
00:41:12,402 --> 00:41:19,743
So close to the magnetic pole, the needle
would point straight up or straight down

424
00:41:19,785 --> 00:41:24,248
Somehow you have to find
your way back to the exit hole

425
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:30,588
or you are trapped under the ceiling of ice

426
00:43:39,437 --> 00:43:43,441
So I selected some areas
that have the tree foraminifera,

427
00:43:43,483 --> 00:43:47,362
and they're the ones we're interested in
right now, to find out if they're carnivores,

428
00:43:47,404 --> 00:43:52,367
whether or not they eat shrimp-like
creatures, multi-cellular creatures

429
00:43:52,409 --> 00:43:56,747
And also I found a few of the urchins
that have, I think,

430
00:43:56,789 --> 00:44:01,210
they're the ones that have
a parasitic worm that lives in their anus

431
00:44:01,252 --> 00:44:03,963
It's a pretty beautiful scarlet worm,

432
00:44:04,005 --> 00:44:11,888
but it must be a horrible way to make a life,
I would think

433
00:44:13,807 --> 00:44:16,310
ANNOUNCER ON TV I tell you, gentlemen,
science has agreed

434
00:44:16,352 --> 00:44:19,105
that unless something is done,
and done quickly,

435
00:44:19,146 --> 00:44:27,280
man as the dominant species of life on Earth
will be extinct within a year

436
00:44:27,322 --> 00:44:29,407
HERZOG Sam Bowser likes to show

437
00:44:29,449 --> 00:44:35,080
doomsday science fiction films
to the researchers

438
00:44:35,122 --> 00:44:42,088
Many of them express grave doubts about
our long-ranging presence on this planet

439
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:45,633
Nature, they predict, will regulate us

440
00:44:45,675 --> 00:44:49,554
ANNOUNCER Stay in your homes
I repeat, stay in your homes

441
00:44:49,596 --> 00:44:51,974
Your personal safety,
the safety of the entire city

442
00:44:52,015 --> 00:44:56,437
depends upon your full cooperation
with the military authorities

00:44:56,479 --> 00:45:02,986
Yes! Cities, nations, even civilization itself
threatened with annihilation

444
00:45:03,027 --> 00:45:06,323

history-making violence,

wrought its most awesome creation

For born in that swirling inferno of
radioactive dust

447
00:45:13,872 --> 00:45:19,086
were things so horrible,
so terrifying, so hideous

448
00:45:19,128 --> 00:45:24,426
there is no word to describe them

449
00:45:29,222 --> 00:45:32,851
We may be witnesses to
a biblical prophecy come true

BOWSER: This is just the flower part
The body is somewhere in the dirt over there

454
00:45:46,324 --> 00:45:49,870
HERZOG All that the divers had brought
back from the ocean floor

455
00:45:49,912 --> 00:45:55,501
were a few spoonfuls of sand containing
the strange single-celled creatures

456
00:45:55,543 --> 00:45:59,130
the scientists are studying here

457
00:45:59,172 --> 00:46:05,929
They are known as tree foraminifera,
primordial single-celled organisms

458
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:09,182
They branch out in the shape of trees

459
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:13,812
The branches give off pseudopodia,
microscopic false feet

460
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:21,946
that gather and assemble grains of sand
into a protective shell around the twigs

461
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:25,659
BOWSER: These are the pseudopodia
that are secreted by foraminifera

462
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:30,581
They're long, thin, tendril-like projections

463
00:46:30,622 --> 00:46:32,333
What the foram does is it wakes up,

464
00:46:32,374 --> 00:46:36,212
sends out the pseudopods and then just
grabs every particle in its environment

465
00:46:36,254 --> 00:46:40,008
and pulls them in toward its body

466
00:46:40,049 --> 00:46:43,637
There's a certain pattern to the way
that they sort the particles

467
00:46:43,678 --> 00:46:46,848
They can select particular grains
out of everything in the environment

468
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:51,103
and just end up with them
They're beautiful masons

469
00:46:51,145 --> 00:46:54,774
HERZOG: Could that be
a very early appearance of intelligence?

470
00:46:54,815 --> 00:46:58,569
- I say it with great care
- Yeah, I have to say it with great care, too,

471
00:46:58,611 --> 00:47:01,990
because there are stories about

472
00:47:02,031 --> 00:47:05,660
how these particular organisms
have fit into that debate

473
00:47:05,702 --> 00:47:07,913
Turn of the last century, for example,

474
00:47:07,955 --> 00:47:11,625
there was a scientist,
a British scientist named Heron-Allen

475
00:47:11,667 --> 00:47:15,171
who, apparently, during one of the debates

476
00:47:15,212 --> 00:47:18,007
in one of the British societies was

477
00:47:18,049 --> 00:47:21,469
pointing out the fact that
every definition of intelligence

478
00:47:21,511 --> 00:47:28,560
that was being formulated could be
fulfilled by these single-celled creatures

479
00:47:28,602 --> 00:47:32,481
Borderline intelligence,
yeah, at the single-celled level

480
00:47:32,523 --> 00:47:36,194
I mean, it is a manifestation
of the best of our abilities, really,

It's almost art

(DRILLING)

483
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:35,281
HERZOG I noticed that the divers,
in their routine, were not speaking at all

484
00:49:35,323 --> 00:49:42,122
To me,
they were like priests preparing for mass

485
00:50:03,395 --> 00:50:08,859
Under the ice, the divers find themselves

One of the foremost scholars in the world
in his field, Dr Pawlowski,

491
00:54:57,423 --> 00:55:01,302
studies the DNA sequences of foraminifera

492
00:55:01,343 --> 00:55:09,310
What looks esoteric is in fact one of the
fundamental questions about life on Earth

493
00:55:09,352 --> 00:55:14,274
In the same way that cosmologists search
for the origins of the universe,

494
00:55:14,316 --> 00:55:24,076
the scientists here are tracing back
the evolution of life to its earliest stages

495
00:55:24,118 --> 00:55:31,251
Sometimes the building blocks
of the sequences all seem to fit

496
00:55:31,293 --> 00:55:35,380
Jan, what have you found today so far
on the sample that we found?

497
00:55:35,422 --> 00:55:37,341
- Three new species

Three new species on the dish
That's fantastic

499
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:44,015
- This is from the ROMEO site
- Yeah, from the ROMEO site

500
00:55:44,056 --> 00:55:49,604
It's one small silver and two elongated ones
I don't know what it is

501
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:51,606
We have to do the DNA, too

HERZOG: Is this a great moment?

503
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:57,655
- Yeah, yeah, this is
- Yeah, any time you increase

504
00:55:57,696 --> 00:56:01,242
the known diversity of these types
of creatures, it's pretty exciting

505
00:56:01,283 --> 00:56:04,704

After the helicopter had dropped us off
back at McMurdo,

nobody was around The sundial showed
that it was close to 100 am

516
00:57:58,869 --> 00:58:04,083
It did not feel like night,
so we had a look around

517
00:58:04,125 --> 00:58:12,843
This unobtrusive building
had raised my curiosity for quite a while

518
00:58:47,005 --> 00:58:52,678
Here amongst unripe tomatoes,
we ran into this young man

519
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,306
How did he end up in this place?

520
00:58:55,347 --> 00:58:58,726
Oh, yeah, well, you know, I like to say,

521
00:58:58,768 --> 00:59:01,604
if you take everybody who's not tied down,
they all sort of

00:59:01,646 --> 00:59:03,815
fall down to the bottom of the planet, so,

00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:11,824
I remember
when I first got down here I sort of

526
00:59:11,865 --> 00:59:15,119
enjoyed the sensation of recognizing people
with my tribal markings

527
00:59:15,161 --> 00:59:18,331
You know, I was like,
"Hey, these are my people"

528

PhDs washing dishes and, you know,
linguists on a continent with no languages

529
00:59:24,087 --> 00:59:26,173
and that sort of thing, yeah It's great

530
00:59:26,214 --> 00:59:29,843
Yeah, specifically I was in
a graduate program, and we had lined up

531
00:59:29,885 --> 00:59:34,432
to do some work with
one of the people who was

532
00:59:34,473 --> 00:59:38,770
identified as a native speaker
and a competent native speaker of

533
00:59:38,811 --> 00:59:41,856
one of the languages
of the Winnebago people, the Ho-Chunk,

534
00:59:41,898 --> 00:59:44,276
I think is how they pronounced it, and

535
00:59:44,317 --> 00:59:46,945
HERZOG To make a complicated story short,

536
00:59:46,987 --> 00:59:53,035
he ran into New Age ideologues who made
insipid claims about black and white magic

537
00:59:53,077 --> 00:59:55,538
embedded in the grammar of this language

538
00:59:55,579 --> 00:59:57,832
Some of the oral tradition
that had been passed along

539
00:59:57,874 --> 01:00:01,044
Hence, in this stupid trend of academia,

540
01:00:01,085 --> 01:00:04,381
it would be better to let the language die
than preserve it

541
01:00:04,422 --> 01:00:06,091
you know, I could document a language

He had to destroy his entire PhD research

543
01:00:09,928 --> 01:00:13,390
So just imagine, you know, 90

544
01:00:13,432 --> 01:00:16,853
of languages will be extinct
probably in my lifetime

545
01:00:16,894 --> 01:00:19,063
It's a catastrophic impact

546
01:00:19,105 --> 01:00:22,484
to an ecosystem to talk
about that kind of extinction

547
01:00:22,525 --> 01:00:25,737
Culturally, we're talking
about the same thing I mean,

548
01:00:25,779 --> 01:00:29,158
you know, what if you lost all of

549
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:32,828
Russian literature, or something like that,
or Russian, you know? If you took all of the

550
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:38,251
Slavic languages and just they went
away, you know, and no more Tolstoy

551
01:00:38,293 --> 01:00:42,589
It occurred to me that in the time
we spent with him in the greenhouse,

552
01:00:42,631 --> 01:00:47,094
possibly three or four languages had died

553

In our efforts to preserve
endangered species,

554
01:00:50,723 --> 01:00:55,436
we seem to overlook something
equally important

555
01:00:55,478 --> 01:00:59,816
To me,
it is a sign of a deeply disturbed civilization

556
01:00:59,858 --> 01:01:04,905
where tree huggers and whale huggers
in their weirdness are acceptable,

truck across Africa from London to Nairobi

That was a trip Four months in
a garbage truck It was horrible

563
01:01:47,201 --> 01:01:51,580
On numerous occasions we came pretty
close to, I don't know about dying,

564
01:01:51,622 --> 01:01:53,833
but pretty close
to being in some straits where

565
01:01:53,875 --> 01:01:57,337
we didn't know if we were gonna get back
out of it, you know

566
01:01:57,378 --> 01:02:00,382
We got taken over by the military in Uganda,

567
01:02:00,423 --> 01:02:04,219
and we were kidnapped, basically
Truck was turned around

568
01:02:04,261 --> 01:02:07,848
and we were going back to Entebbe
We got out of that one

569
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:13,896
We were trying to wait for
this ferry in Wadi Halfa,

570
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:16,608
the one that blew up and 800 people died

571
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:19,402
Well, we didn't get on that one
We took off across a desert,

572
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:23,615
and we got stuck We got stuck for five days

573
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:30,373
of absolute agony, of clawing
this truck with We were using plates,

574
01:02:30,414 --> 01:02:35,378
just the dinner plates that we were using
for dinner, clawing at the tires

575
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:39,341
We had no water
He had used all the water tanks for gasoline,

576
01:02:39,382 --> 01:02:42,761
so basically we had a cup of water a day
or two cups

HERZOG Her story goes on forever

578
01:02:45,556 --> 01:02:48,058

with a herd of angry elephants pursuing her
through tsetse fly-invested swamps

580

HERZOG Back in the days of Amundsen,
Scott and Shackleton,

624
01:06:45,608 --> 01:06:49,237
scientific exploration of Antarctica began,

625
01:06:49,279 --> 01:06:56,995
and this opening of the unknown continent
is their great achievement

626
01:06:57,037 --> 01:07:03,627
But one thing about the early explorers
does not feel right

627
01:07:03,669 --> 01:07:11,094
The obsession to be the first one
to set his foot on the South Pole

628
01:07:11,136 --> 01:07:16,725
It was for personal fame
and the glory of the British Empire

629
01:07:16,767 --> 01:07:25,568
This is Shackleton's original hut,
preserved unchanged for 100 years

630
01:07:26,569 --> 01:07:29,405
But, in a way, from the South Pole onwards

631
01:07:29,447 --> 01:07:32,325
there was no further expansion possible,

632
01:07:32,367 --> 01:07:39,500
and the Empire started to fade
into the abyss of history

633
01:07:39,541 --> 01:07:45,923
It all looks now like an extinct supermarket

634
01:07:51,513 --> 01:07:56,727
On a cultural level,
it meant the end of adventure

635
01:07:56,768 --> 01:08:02,024
Exposing the last unknown spots
of this Earth was irreversible,

636
01:08:02,066 --> 01:08:06,195
but it feels sad
that the South Pole or Mount Everest

637
01:08:06,237 --> 01:08:12,118
were not left in peace in their dignity

638
01:08:12,953 --> 01:08:17,624
It may be a futile wish
to keep a few white spots on our maps,

639
01:08:17,666 --> 01:08:22,672
but human adventure, in its original sense,
lost its meaning,

640
01:08:22,713 --> 01:08:30,096
became an issue for the
Guinness Book of World Records

641
01:08:31,306 --> 01:08:35,686
Scott and Amundsen
were clearly early protagonists,

642
01:08:35,727 --> 01:08:40,399
and from there on
it degenerated into absurd quests

643
01:08:40,441 --> 01:08:45,863
A Frenchman crossed the Sahara Desert
in his car set in reverse gear,

644
01:08:45,905 --> 01:08:50,201
and I am waiting for the first barefoot runner
on the summit of Everest

645
01:08:50,243 --> 01:08:56,542
or the first one hopping into the South Pole
on a pogo stick

646
01:08:56,583 --> 01:09:02,340
FURMAN Well, I had this idea of breaking
a Guinness record in every continent,

647
01:09:02,381 --> 01:09:04,467
and Antarctica would be the sixth,

648
01:09:04,509 --> 01:09:08,304
so, now I'm trying to think of a way
to get to Antarctica

649
01:09:08,346 --> 01:09:11,933
Ashrita Furman did not want
to travel this way,

650
01:09:11,975 --> 01:09:16,981
because he already holds a
Guinness record in this discipline

651
01:09:17,022 --> 01:09:18,816
And also in this one

652
01:09:18,858 --> 01:09:24,155
So, he decided upon the more prosaic
approach and took an airplane

653
01:09:24,197 --> 01:09:25,865
We flew down to Antarctica

654
01:09:25,907 --> 01:09:28,076
Anyway, it was thrilling
because I'm in Antarctica,

655
01:09:28,118 --> 01:09:30,078
and I'm trying to break a Guinness record

656
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,497
Being in Antarctica
is like being on the moon

657
01:09:32,539 --> 01:09:36,710
It's so I mean, it's so peaceful
It's so pure

658
01:09:36,752 --> 01:09:43,551
It's so desolate
I mean, it's just a great place

659
01:09:45,386 --> 01:09:52,477
HERZOG Antarctica is not the moon,
even though sometimes it feels like it

660
01:09:52,519 --> 01:09:54,104
Yet, on this planet,

661
01:09:54,146 --> 01:10:03,239
McMurdo comes closest to what
a future space settlement would look like

662
01:10:05,867 --> 01:10:09,162
(PENGUINS CAWING)

663
01:10:09,204 --> 01:10:13,792
We left McMurdo for the penguin colony
at Cape Royds

664
01:10:13,834 --> 01:10:16,420
Everyone spoke about penguins,

665
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:23,886
however, the questions I had
were not so easily answered

666
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:27,057
I was referred to a penguin expert out there

667
01:10:27,098 --> 01:10:31,812
who had studied them for almost 20 years

668
01:10:31,853 --> 01:10:34,773
I was told that he was a taciturn man,

669
01:10:34,815 --> 01:10:40,738
who, in his solitude, was not much into
conversation with humans anymore

670
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:44,409
But Dr Ainley gave his best effort

671
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:48,079
Well, here we are at Cape Royds

672
01:10:48,121 --> 01:10:53,419
This is 2006,
and it's just about the 100th anniversary

673
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:57,923
of the first penguin study
that was ever done,

674
01:10:57,965 --> 01:11:00,927
which was done here at Cape Royds by

675
01:11:00,968 --> 01:11:07,517
a person that was part
of the Shackleton expedition

676
01:11:07,559 --> 01:11:12,397
They all had a good winter,
and they're very fat

677
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:14,984
They've

678
01:11:15,025 --> 01:11:19,780
claimed their territories and eggs have
been laid and females have left,

679
01:11:19,822 --> 01:11:25,203
and now there's just males
that are sitting on eggs,

680
01:11:25,245 --> 01:11:29,541
using their fat reserves
and waiting for females to return

681
01:11:29,583 --> 01:11:34,797
to relieve them and then go to sea

682
01:11:34,839 --> 01:11:38,050
I tried to keep the conversation going

683
01:11:38,092 --> 01:11:43,097
Dr Ainley, I read somewhere
that there are gay penguins

684
01:11:43,139 --> 01:11:47,853
What are your observations?

685
01:11:49,396 --> 01:11:52,399
I've never

686
01:11:52,816 --> 01:11:55,986
Or strange sexual behavior
Can you talk about

687
01:11:56,028 --> 01:12:02,494
Yeah, there has been I've seen
triangular relationships where there's

688
01:12:02,535 --> 01:12:08,417
one female and two males,
and the female lays the egg,

689
01:12:08,458 --> 01:12:16,342
or eggs, and the males and the female
trade off over the season

690
01:12:16,384 --> 01:12:24,267
There are mis-identities, initially,
of the sex of penguins

691
01:12:25,685 --> 01:12:31,358
Somebody recently described
what they call prostitution where

692
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:36,364
a female, who is out
collecting rocks for her nest,

693
01:12:36,405 --> 01:12:38,825
and, of course, some penguins are

694
01:12:38,866 --> 01:12:41,369
The only way they collect rocks
is to steal them from others

695
01:12:41,411 --> 01:12:44,831
So, in order to do that,
they have to be very submissive

696
01:12:44,873 --> 01:12:50,003
in order to get close to a male,
who's maybe advertising for a mate,

697
01:12:50,045 --> 01:12:56,886
and so she'll come in, sit in his nest,
and sometimes they'll copulate

698
01:12:56,928 --> 01:13:00,181
But, really, her idea is to get a rock,

699
01:13:00,223 --> 01:13:07,230
and so, as soon as she can,
she escapes with a rock

700
01:13:07,272 --> 01:13:13,779
Dr Ainley, is there such thing
as insanity among penguins?

701
01:13:13,821 --> 01:13:17,992
I try to avoid the definition of insanity
or derangement

702
01:13:18,034 --> 01:13:23,415
I don't mean that a penguin
might believe he or she is Lenin

703
01:13:23,456 --> 01:13:28,003
or Napoleon Bonaparte,
but could they just go crazy

704
01:13:28,045 --> 01:13:34,343
because they've had enough of
their colony?

705
01:13:35,428 --> 01:13:41,393
Well, I've never seen a penguin
bashing its head against a rock

706
01:13:41,434 --> 01:13:44,312
They do get disoriented

707
01:13:44,354 --> 01:13:52,947
They end up in places they shouldn't be,
a long way from the ocean

708
01:13:53,197 --> 01:14:01,998
HERZOG These penguins are all heading
to the open water to the right

709
01:14:02,165 --> 01:14:07,421
But one of them caught our eye,
the one in the center

710
01:14:07,463 --> 01:14:12,009
He would neither go towards the feeding
grounds at the edge of the ice,

711
01:14:12,051 --> 01:14:16,305
nor return to the colony

712
01:14:16,347 --> 01:14:21,102
Shortly afterwards, we saw him heading
straight towards the mountains,

713
01:14:21,144 --> 01:14:25,440
some 70 kilometers away

714
01:14:25,941 --> 01:14:29,695
Dr Ainley explained
that even if he caught him

715
01:14:29,737 --> 01:14:31,989
and brought him back to the colony,

716
01:14:32,031 --> 01:14:38,538
he would immediately head right back
for the mountains

717
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:41,374
But why?

718
01:14:50,885 --> 01:14:54,847
One of these disoriented,
or deranged, penguins

719
01:14:54,889 --> 01:14:57,684
showed up at the New Harbor diving camp,

720
01:14:57,725 --> 01:15:05,234
already some 80 kilometers away
from where it should be

721
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:11,365
The rules for the humans
are do not disturb or hold up the penguin

722
01:15:11,407 --> 01:15:17,121
Stand still and let him go on his way

723
01:15:18,915 --> 01:15:24,963
And here, he's heading off into the interior
of the vast continent

724
01:15:25,005 --> 01:15:34,015
With 5,000 kilometers ahead of him,
he's heading towards certain death

725
01:15:42,774 --> 01:15:47,905
The last field camp we visited
was at Mount Erebus

726
01:15:47,947 --> 01:15:53,077
This active volcano is 12,500 feet high

727
01:15:53,119 --> 01:15:58,750
It is of particular importance, as inside
the crater the magma of the inner earth

728
01:15:58,792 --> 01:16:02,462
is directly exposed

729
01:16:02,504 --> 01:16:06,258
There are only two other such volcanoes
in the world,

730
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:10,763
one in the Congo and the other in Ethiopia

731
01:16:10,805 --> 01:16:13,933
Because of political strife in those places,

732
01:16:13,975 --> 01:16:20,607
it is actually easier to conduct field studies
here in Antarctica

733
01:16:20,649 --> 01:16:26,572
First thing, we were instructed in
the etiquette of dealing with this volcano

734
01:16:26,614 --> 01:16:30,785
One very important thing to keep in mind
when you're on the crater

735
01:16:30,826 --> 01:16:35,165
is that the lava lake
could explode at any time,

736
01:16:35,206 --> 01:16:41,546
and if it does, it's vital to keep
your attention faced toward the lava lake

737
01:16:41,588 --> 01:16:45,467
and watch for bombs
that are tracking up into the air

738
01:16:45,509 --> 01:16:51,182
and try to pick out the ones that might be
coming toward you and step out of the way

739
01:16:51,224 --> 01:16:56,604
The last thing you wanna do is turn away
from the crater or run or crouch down

740
01:16:56,646 --> 01:17:02,986
Keep your attention toward the lava lake,
look up and move out of the way

741
01:17:03,028 --> 01:17:09,368
HERZOG We were fortunate that the lava
lake was not enshrouded in mist this day

742
01:17:09,410 --> 01:17:13,998
This here is the new observation camera

743
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:19,504
William Mclntosh is the leader
of the team of volcanologists here

744
01:17:19,546 --> 01:17:24,009
This camera is designed for prison riots
or to be explosion proof,

745
01:17:24,051 --> 01:17:28,180
and it's coated with this thick
Teflon housing

746
01:17:28,222 --> 01:17:32,060
Here's the lens here This is a camera

747
01:17:32,101 --> 01:17:38,233
The camera inside is made by a small
company in Canada, Extreme CCTV

748
01:17:38,275 --> 01:17:41,695
The inside housing is specifically
designed for explosion

749
01:17:41,737 --> 01:17:43,030
(EXPLOSION)

750
01:17:43,072 --> 01:17:44,114
to be explosion-proof

751
01:17:44,156 --> 01:17:52,165
There's a bang from the lava lake
right now No bombs, though

752
01:17:56,169 --> 01:18:02,384
HERZOG This is the magma lake
filmed 30 years ago

753
01:18:02,426 --> 01:18:10,935
At that time, there was a bold attempt
to descend into the crater

754
01:18:16,274 --> 01:18:19,236
Halfway down there is a plateau

755
01:18:19,278 --> 01:18:27,286
From there, it is a gaping hole straight down
into the magma

756
01:18:43,888 --> 01:18:48,893
They were in for near disaster

757
01:18:56,860 --> 01:19:07,079
The magma exploded, striking one of the
climbers, who got away with minor injuries

758
01:19:11,417 --> 01:19:18,634
Today, the lava is monitored
by Dr Mclntosh's camera

759
01:19:48,207 --> 01:19:53,213
Dr Clive Oppenheimer, a true Englishman
from Cambridge University,

760
01:19:53,255 --> 01:20:00,179
surprised us with his tweed outfit, which
he wears as a tribute to the explorers of old

761
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:05,309
He analyzes gas emissions
from volcanoes all over the world

762
01:20:05,351 --> 01:20:08,479
If this were one of those active
volcanoes in Indonesia,

763
01:20:08,521 --> 01:20:11,983
I'd be far more circumspect
about standing on the crater rim

764
01:20:12,025 --> 01:20:15,237
This is a very benign form of volcanism,

765
01:20:15,278 --> 01:20:21,535
and even the eruptions we've seen in the
historic period are relatively minor affairs

766
01:20:21,577 --> 01:20:24,372
If we go back into the geological record,

767
01:20:24,413 --> 01:20:27,333
we see that there are huge

768
01:20:27,375 --> 01:20:31,921
volcanic eruptions,
massive, explosive eruptions that produced

769
01:20:31,963 --> 01:20:34,007
thousands of cubic miles of pumice,

770
01:20:34,049 --> 01:20:38,262
showering large parts of the Earth
with fine ash,

771
01:20:38,303 --> 01:20:42,725
and these have been demonstrated
to have had a strong impact on climate,

772
01:20:42,767 --> 01:20:46,646
and one of the biggest of these events,
74,000 years ago,

773
01:20:46,688 --> 01:20:49,858
has been argued even to have affected
our human ancestors

774
01:20:49,899 --> 01:20:52,110
and may have played an important role in

775
01:20:52,152 --> 01:20:58,242
the origins and dispersal of early humans

776
01:20:58,951 --> 01:21:03,205
So these events will recur, and I think
the more we understand about them,

777
01:21:03,247 --> 01:21:09,963
the better we can prepare for
their eventuality

778
01:21:12,674 --> 01:21:17,888
HERZOG For this and many other reasons,
our presence on this planet

779
01:21:17,930 --> 01:21:20,808
does not seem to be sustainable

780
01:21:20,850 --> 01:21:27,273
Our technological civilization makes us
particularly vulnerable

781
01:21:27,315 --> 01:21:33,196
There is talk all over the scientific
community about climate change

782
01:21:33,238 --> 01:21:41,122
Many of them agree the end of human life
on this Earth is assured

783
01:21:41,163 --> 01:21:45,335
Human life is part of
an endless chain of catastrophes,

784
01:21:45,376 --> 01:21:51,216
the demise of the dinosaurs being just
one of these events

785
01:21:51,258 --> 01:21:55,053
We seem to be next

786
01:21:59,642 --> 01:22:08,318
And when we are gone, what will happen
thousands of years from now in the future?

787
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:12,072
Will there be alien archeologists
from another planet

788
01:22:12,114 --> 01:22:18,662
trying to find out what we were doing
at the South Pole?

789
01:22:18,704 --> 01:22:25,670
They will descend into the tunnels
that we had dug deep under the pole

790
01:22:25,712 --> 01:22:31,551
It is still minus 70 degrees here,
and that's why this place has outlived

791
01:22:31,593 --> 01:22:36,890
all the large cities in the world

792
01:22:37,808 --> 01:22:41,729
They walk on and on

793
01:22:59,415 --> 01:23:01,459
And then this

794
01:23:01,501 --> 01:23:06,965
As if we had wanted to leave one remnant
of our presence on this planet,

795
01:23:07,006 --> 01:23:11,887
they would find a frozen sturgeon,
mysteriously hidden away

796
01:23:11,929 --> 01:23:18,936
beneath the mathematically precise
true South Pole

797
01:23:36,831 --> 01:23:45,006
They stash it back away
into its frozen shrine for another eternity

798
01:23:45,048 --> 01:23:52,556
And then they find more,
memories of a world once green

799
01:23:52,765 --> 01:23:58,437
As if the human race wanted to preserve
at least some lost beauty of this Earth,

800
01:23:58,479 --> 01:24:05,779
they left this,
framed in a garland of frozen popcorn

801
01:24:13,287 --> 01:24:19,085
Back at the base camp of Mount Erebus,

802
01:24:20,670 --> 01:24:23,590
due to the considerable altitude,

803
01:24:23,631 --> 01:24:30,848
once in a while the volcanologists
need medical care

804
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:37,021
But soon we find them back at work

805
01:25:42,425 --> 01:25:46,138
My face is frozen

806
01:26:24,137 --> 01:26:28,517
Quite cold up here today

807
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:37,276
Just by having that fantastic lava lake
down there with all that energy,

808
01:26:37,318 --> 01:26:45,827
we still have to bring old petrol generators
up to the crater rim

809
01:26:54,045 --> 01:27:01,803
Man versus Machine, Chapter 53
Professor Clive Oppenheimer on Erebus

810
01:27:01,845 --> 01:27:07,434
Hands in pockets,
waiting for it to start spontaneously

811
01:27:07,476 --> 01:27:11,188
He could be waiting a long time

812
01:27:11,230 --> 01:27:15,151
Have you ever seen two men kiss
on the top of Erebus before?

813
01:27:15,193 --> 01:27:17,028
(BOTH LAUGHING)

814
01:27:17,070 --> 01:27:18,696
OPPENHEIMER: Pushing back the frontiers

815
01:27:18,738 --> 01:27:22,325
It's R-18, okay?

816
01:27:22,951 --> 01:27:27,456
I like working with Harry

817
01:27:30,042 --> 01:27:32,628
HERZOG Along the slopes of the volcano

818
01:27:32,670 --> 01:27:39,094
there are vents where steam creates
so-called fumaroles, bizarre chimneys of ice,

819
01:27:39,135 --> 01:27:45,142
sometimes reaching two stories in height

820
01:27:49,939 --> 01:27:54,902
It is possible to descend into some of them

821
01:27:54,944 --> 01:28:03,829
You only have to be careful
to avoid the ones containing toxic gasses

822
01:31:12,116 --> 01:31:15,578
At the foot of Erebus, out on the sea ice,

823
01:31:15,620 --> 01:31:20,209
the two tallest buildings on this continent
are located

824
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:24,213
In these hangars,
scientific payloads are being readied

825
01:31:24,255 --> 01:31:30,845
for their balloon launch
into the stratosphere

826
01:31:41,190 --> 01:31:44,985
We were interested in
the neutrino detection project

827
01:31:45,027 --> 01:31:48,781
Scientists are planning
to lift an observation instrument

828
01:31:48,823 --> 01:31:52,118
40 kilometers up into the stratosphere

829
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:59,376
in search of almost
undetectable subatomic particles

830
01:31:59,501 --> 01:32:02,630
(ALL CHEERING)

831
01:32:02,671 --> 01:32:07,885
As it rises, this small-Iooking bubble
of helium will expand

832
01:32:07,927 --> 01:32:13,433
to fill the entire skin,
which here still looks like a white rope

833
01:32:13,475 --> 01:32:21,317
It will eventually form a gigantic globe
more than 300 feet in diameter

834
01:32:21,358 --> 01:32:23,486
When it reaches the stratosphere,

835
01:32:23,527 --> 01:32:27,615
the detector will scan
thousands of square miles of ice

836
01:32:27,657 --> 01:32:33,538
without encountering electrical
disturbances from the inhabited world

837
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:38,001
Prior to the launch,
we were inside the hangar

838
01:32:38,043 --> 01:32:43,132
The neutrino project is led by
Dr Gorham of the University of Hawaii

839
01:32:43,174 --> 01:32:48,805
So, what we're trying to do
with this instrument is to be the first

840
01:32:48,846 --> 01:32:54,352
scientific group to detect the highest
energy neutrinos in the universe, we hope

841
01:32:54,394 --> 01:32:58,857
HERZOG: Yeah, but, Dr Gorham,
what exactly is a neutrino?

842
01:32:58,899 --> 01:33:03,863
The neutrino is It's the most ridiculous
particle you could imagine

843
01:33:03,904 --> 01:33:08,201
A billion neutrinos went through my nose
as we were talking

844
01:33:08,242 --> 01:33:11,705
A trillion, a trillion of them
went through my nose just now,

845
01:33:11,746 --> 01:33:13,582
and they did nothing to me

846
01:33:13,623 --> 01:33:17,544
They pass through all of the matter
around us continuously,

847
01:33:17,586 --> 01:33:23,050
in a huge, huge blast of particles
that does nothing at all

848
01:33:23,092 --> 01:33:27,013
They're like
They almost exist in a separate universe,

849
01:33:27,055 --> 01:33:29,224
but we know, as physicists,
we can measure them,

850
01:33:29,265 --> 01:33:33,687
we can make precision predictions
and measurements They exist,

851
01:33:33,728 --> 01:33:36,440
but we can't get our hands on them,

852
01:33:36,481 --> 01:33:39,735
because they seem to just exist
in another place,

853
01:33:39,777 --> 01:33:44,907
and yet without neutrinos, the beginning
of the universe would not have worked

854
01:33:44,949 --> 01:33:47,577
We would not have the matter
that we have today,

855
01:33:47,619 --> 01:33:50,580
because you couldn't create
the elements without the neutrinos

856
01:33:50,622 --> 01:33:54,251
In the very, very earliest few seconds
of the big bang,

857
01:33:54,292 --> 01:33:57,921
the neutrinos were the dominant particle,
and they actually determined

858
01:33:57,963 --> 01:34:02,551
much of the kinetics of the production
of the elements we know

859
01:34:02,593 --> 01:34:05,722
So, the universe can't exist the way it is
without the neutrinos,

860
01:34:05,763 --> 01:34:09,392
but they seem
to be in their own separate universe,

861
01:34:09,434 --> 01:34:12,437
and we're trying to actually
make contact with that

862
01:34:12,479 --> 01:34:16,233
otherworldly universe of neutrinos

863
01:34:16,275 --> 01:34:20,696
And as a physicist, even though

864
01:34:20,738 --> 01:34:24,909
I understand it mathematically
and I understand it intellectually,

865
01:34:24,951 --> 01:34:27,579
it still hits me in the gut

866
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:31,082
that there is something here around

867
01:34:31,124 --> 01:34:34,962
surrounding me almost like
some kind of spirit or god

868
01:34:35,003 --> 01:34:37,131
that I can't touch,

869
01:34:37,172 --> 01:34:39,800
but I can measure it

870
01:34:39,842 --> 01:34:41,052
I can make a measurement

871
01:34:41,093 --> 01:34:44,430
It's like measuring the spirit world
or something like that

872
01:34:44,472 --> 01:34:48,476
You can go out and touch these things

873
01:34:48,518 --> 01:34:53,106
HERZOG Not surprisingly, we found
this incantation in Hawaiian language

874
01:34:53,148 --> 01:34:55,776
on the side of his detector

875
01:34:55,818 --> 01:35:01,157
It was as if spirits had to be invoked

876
01:35:01,198 --> 01:35:06,120
What would we see if we could film
the impact of a neutrino?

877
01:35:06,162 --> 01:35:11,543
What you would see is, you would see
a lightning bolt about 10 meters long,

878
01:35:11,585 --> 01:35:13,587
about that thick,

879
01:35:13,629 --> 01:35:18,008
and it would blast at the speed of light
over this 10 meter distance,

880
01:35:18,050 --> 01:35:21,971
and you would see the most beautiful
blue light your eyes have ever seen

881
01:35:22,013 --> 01:35:25,934
It happens in about

882
01:35:26,392 --> 01:35:29,229
The entire impulse of radio waves

883
01:35:29,271 --> 01:35:32,899
is up and down in probably

884
01:35:32,941 --> 01:35:37,196
one one-hundred billionth of a second

885
01:35:37,238 --> 01:35:45,830
It just goes bang and it's gone,
and that's what we're looking for

886
01:36:09,815 --> 01:36:15,112
There is a beautiful saying by an American,

887
01:36:15,154 --> 01:36:21,285
a philosopher, Alan Watts,
and he used to say that through our eyes,

888
01:36:21,327 --> 01:36:24,205
the universe is perceiving itself,

889
01:36:24,247 --> 01:36:29,252
and through our ears, the universe
is listening to its cosmic harmonies,

890
01:36:29,294 --> 01:36:34,758
and we are the witness
through which the universe

891
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:41,891
becomes conscious of its glory,
of its magnificence
