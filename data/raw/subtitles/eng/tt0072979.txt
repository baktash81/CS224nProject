1
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,132
I got lots

2
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,971
Of problems

3
00:00:38,234 --> 00:00:41,047
Female trouble

4
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:45,750
Maybe I'm twisted

5
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,429
Female trouble

6
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,379
They say I'm a skank

7
00:00:57,402 --> 00:01:00,248
But I don't care

8
00:01:00,273 --> 00:01:02,221
Go ahead, put me

9
00:01:02,244 --> 00:01:04,953
In your El-e-ectric chair

10
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,326
I got lots

11
00:01:06,351 --> 00:01:08,662
Of problems

12
00:01:11,226 --> 00:01:13,970
Female trouble

13
00:01:16,168 --> 00:01:18,707
Maybe I'm twisted

14
00:01:21,644 --> 00:01:24,149
Female trouble

15
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,127
Hey, spare me your morals

16
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,075
Look, everyone does

17
00:01:33,098 --> 00:01:35,307
What pleases me

18
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:37,748
Is paradise

19
00:01:37,772 --> 00:01:38,911
I got lots

20
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:41,287
Of problems

21
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,760
Female trouble

22
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:51,532
Maybe I'm twisted

23
00:01:54,468 --> 00:01:56,972
Female trouble

24
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,121
Oink, oink

25
00:02:03,151 --> 00:02:05,894
Oink, oink

26
00:02:05,921 --> 00:02:09,235
I'm berserk

27
00:02:09,261 --> 00:02:10,832
I like it

28
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:12,037
Fine

29
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:19,754
As long as I'm

30
00:02:19,779 --> 00:02:22,421
Grabbing a headline

31
00:02:22,451 --> 00:02:24,057
Ah ha ha, yeah

32
00:02:24,088 --> 00:02:25,726
I got lots

33
00:02:25,756 --> 00:02:28,000
Of problems

34
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:53,650
Good morning, Dawn.

35
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:55,312
- Hey, I like that skirt.
- Thanks.

36
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,153
My old lady's supposed to
get me one for Christmas...

37
00:02:57,179 --> 00:02:59,319
if she's not too dumb
to find it.

38
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:00,989
Oh, Concetta,
I know what you mean.

39
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,500
My parents better get me
them cha-cha heels I asked for.

40
00:03:03,523 --> 00:03:05,163
That's all I can say.

41
00:03:05,193 --> 00:03:06,433
Hey, hon,
you got any Spray Net?

42
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:08,943
My hair is fallin' right down
right off my head.

43
00:03:08,966 --> 00:03:10,104
Sure, hon.

44
00:03:10,134 --> 00:03:11,443
You do your Geography homework?

45
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,282
Fuck no. Fuck homework.
Who cares if we fail?

46
00:03:14,308 --> 00:03:17,485
I wanna quit,
and lam right after I get...

47
00:03:17,514 --> 00:03:19,825
my Christmas presents.

48
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:21,264
Duncan?

49
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:22,494
Here.

50
00:03:22,522 --> 00:03:24,731
- Dune?
-Here.

51
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,173
Friar?

52
00:03:28,467 --> 00:03:32,441
Miss Friar,
are you hard-of-hearing?

53
00:03:32,474 --> 00:03:33,715
Here.

54
00:03:35,178 --> 00:03:36,681
Stand up, please.

55
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:39,960
What on earth are you wearing?

56
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:41,490
This is not Halloween.

57
00:03:41,523 --> 00:03:44,062
It's just a skirt and sweater.

58
00:03:44,094 --> 00:03:45,665
Button those buttons,
young lady.

59
00:03:45,697 --> 00:03:48,680
I bet your mother didn't
see you dressed like that.

60
00:03:48,702 --> 00:03:50,513
It's hot in here.

61
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:53,681
That will be all.
This is a classroom...

62
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:56,023
not a cocktail lounge,
Miss Friar.

63
00:03:56,048 --> 00:03:59,190
Take this dress code
violation slip home...

64
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,224
and have it signed
by your parents.

65
00:04:01,258 --> 00:04:03,364
And take that gum
out of your mouth!

66
00:04:03,394 --> 00:04:05,034
For the 10th time!

67
00:04:05,064 --> 00:04:07,341
If I catch you with gum
in your mouth one more time...

68
00:04:07,368 --> 00:04:09,680
you will be in detention
for a month.

69
00:04:09,705 --> 00:04:10,981
Do you understand?

70
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:14,356
I understand, Mr. Weinberger.

71
00:04:17,853 --> 00:04:20,392
You're late, young ladies!

72
00:04:20,424 --> 00:04:22,667
And I'll now report you
on this late slip.

73
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:24,539
I had you marked absent.

74
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:37,792
Now, class...before letting you
go for the holiday season...

75
00:04:37,821 --> 00:04:40,167
we're going to have
a pop quiz.

76
00:04:48,573 --> 00:04:52,456
When called on, stand,
answer the question.

77
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,555
If you are correct,
it'll be duly recorded.

78
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,966
If you are wrong,
a small red "F"...

79
00:04:57,991 --> 00:05:00,598
will be placed next to
your name in my roll book.

80
00:05:00,628 --> 00:05:03,168
All right, let's begin.

81
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,308
Jude Fine, true or false?

82
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:10,016
Baltimore was once capital
of the United States.

83
00:05:11,114 --> 00:05:12,253
False?

84
00:05:12,283 --> 00:05:15,630
True, true.
True, Miss Jude Fine.

85
00:05:15,655 --> 00:05:17,533
You must have been
talking on the phone...

86
00:05:17,558 --> 00:05:19,597
instead of doing
your homework last night.

87
00:05:19,628 --> 00:05:24,706
It was the capital for 2 months
during the Revolutionary War.

88
00:05:24,737 --> 00:05:27,777
That's two red Fs for you
in just one week.

89
00:05:27,809 --> 00:05:30,291
It looks like you'll
be getting a deficiency.

90
00:05:30,314 --> 00:05:32,318
What is it, Miss Holland?

91
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:36,997
Mr. Weinberger, Dawn Davenport
is eating a meatball sandwich...

92
00:05:37,026 --> 00:05:41,068
right out in class,
and she's been passing notes.

93
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,604
I was not eating.

94
00:05:43,637 --> 00:05:45,585
I got a knife here
in my pocketbook...

95
00:05:45,608 --> 00:05:48,090
and I'm gonna
cut you up after class.

96
00:05:48,112 --> 00:05:49,990
Stop this, immediately!

97
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:53,397
Now they're threatening me,
these awful, cheap girls.

98
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:56,097
My mother told me
to report this kind of thing.

99
00:05:56,126 --> 00:05:58,607
I'm trying to get an education.

100
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,769
All of you, stop it!

101
00:05:59,798 --> 00:06:01,438
Dawn Davenport, stand up!

102
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:03,245
I'm trying to get
an education...

103
00:06:03,271 --> 00:06:05,116
so I can get
into a good college!

104
00:06:05,142 --> 00:06:06,382
It's not fair!

105
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,085
That will be all.

106
00:06:08,114 --> 00:06:10,391
You were quite proper
in reporting this incident...

107
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:12,228
but that will be enough.

108
00:06:12,254 --> 00:06:14,565
She was trying
to copy my homework.

109
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:16,903
That's untrue, and you know it.

110
00:06:16,929 --> 00:06:20,572
Dawn Davenport,
you are a habitual liar...

111
00:06:20,602 --> 00:06:22,515
and I'm quite
well-aware of it.

112
00:06:22,538 --> 00:06:25,021
You will go to detention
for a month for this.

113
00:06:25,044 --> 00:06:27,925
I won't go. I wasn't eating.

114
00:06:27,948 --> 00:06:30,226
From your appearance,
Miss Davenport...

115
00:06:30,253 --> 00:06:32,598
it looked like you
never stopped eating.

116
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,168
Get up here!

117
00:06:39,134 --> 00:06:41,446
Now, write 50 times
on this blackboard...

118
00:06:41,472 --> 00:06:43,510
"I will not eat in class."

119
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:46,082
'Cause I'm fat enough already.

120
00:06:52,491 --> 00:06:55,804
Now, start writing and don't
stop until I tell you to.

121
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,814
I can tell you one thing,
Miss Davenport...

122
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:02,810
you can count on a failing grade
in Geography this term!

123
00:07:02,843 --> 00:07:05,986
I'd like to set fire
to this dump.

124
00:07:06,015 --> 00:07:08,860
Just 'cause we're pretty,
everybody's jealous.

125
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,424
It's like a prison here.

126
00:07:10,456 --> 00:07:12,767
Even at Christmas,
it's like a prison.

127
00:07:12,793 --> 00:07:15,106
Don't even mention
Christmas, Chicklette.

128
00:07:15,132 --> 00:07:16,942
My parents are gonna
be real sore...

129
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:18,778
if I don't get
them cha-cha heels.

130
00:07:18,804 --> 00:07:20,785
I asked, and I better get.

131
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,584
I never get enough
Christmas presents.

132
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:23,956
Everybody's so damn cheap.

133
00:07:23,981 --> 00:07:25,790
I should be gettin' a lot...

134
00:07:25,816 --> 00:07:28,298
and I'm gonna take it all back
and get the money for it.

135
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,629
You can do that, you know.

136
00:07:29,656 --> 00:07:31,695
We'll probably get caught
for hookin' this period...

137
00:07:31,727 --> 00:07:32,900
but who cares?

138
00:07:32,929 --> 00:07:34,807
Who cares if we fail?

139
00:07:34,832 --> 00:07:36,642
It'd be fun to be expelled.

140
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:39,652
I hope I get arrested.
I hate this school...

141
00:07:39,674 --> 00:07:42,714
and all these ignorant teachers
who don't know one thing.

142
00:07:42,746 --> 00:07:44,749
I'm the one
who should be teachin'.

143
00:07:44,782 --> 00:07:47,459
I hate my parents, too.

144
00:07:47,755 --> 00:07:49,667
Jingle bells, jingle bells

145
00:07:49,691 --> 00:07:52,004
Jingle all the way

146
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,977
Oh, what fun it is to ride

147
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:56,003
In a one-horse open sleigh

148
00:07:56,037 --> 00:07:59,179
Dawn, come see what
Santa brought you!

149
00:08:02,714 --> 00:08:06,460
Oh, Christ, I'm comin'.

150
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:09,960
Please, Howard, try to get
through this without a fight.

151
00:08:09,994 --> 00:08:13,876
I can't stand another one,
not on Christmas.

152
00:08:13,901 --> 00:08:16,679
I better get them
cha-cha heels.

153
00:08:19,912 --> 00:08:23,487
How very sweet of you, dear.

154
00:08:23,517 --> 00:08:25,828
Merry Christmas, honeybunch.

155
00:08:25,854 --> 00:08:28,599
Hey, wonder what this could be.

156
00:08:28,627 --> 00:08:30,630
A fishing rod?

157
00:08:31,865 --> 00:08:35,509
Won't you join us in a carol
before we open our gifts?

158
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:36,677
Oh, mother!

159
00:08:36,707 --> 00:08:39,383
Ah, come on, Dawn.
It adds to the spirit.

160
00:08:40,414 --> 00:08:43,522
Silent night

161
00:08:43,552 --> 00:08:46,797
Holy night

162
00:08:46,824 --> 00:08:49,831
All is calm

163
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:53,041
All is bright

164
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:59,081
Sleep in heavenly peace

165
00:08:59,113 --> 00:09:04,396
Sleep in heavenly peace

166
00:09:16,043 --> 00:09:18,525
What are these?

167
00:09:18,548 --> 00:09:21,292
Those are
your new shoes, Dawn.

168
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:22,799
Those aren't the right kind.

169
00:09:22,822 --> 00:09:24,029
I told you cha-cha heels!

170
00:09:24,057 --> 00:09:25,196
Black ones.

171
00:09:25,226 --> 00:09:26,901
Nice girls don't
wear cha-cha heels.

172
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,068
Give me those presents.

173
00:09:28,098 --> 00:09:29,772
I'll never wear
those ugly shoes.

174
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,405
I told you the kind I wanted.

175
00:09:31,436 --> 00:09:33,076
You've ruined my Christmas.

176
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:37,392
Please, Dawn, not on Christmas!

177
00:09:37,414 --> 00:09:39,191
Get off me, you ugly witch.

178
00:09:39,218 --> 00:09:41,894
You devil! Come here!
You'll pay for this!

179
00:09:41,922 --> 00:09:43,061
You devil, Dawn Davenport!

180
00:09:43,091 --> 00:09:44,229
Look at your mother.

181
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:45,739
Leave me alone!

182
00:09:45,762 --> 00:09:46,902
You're such a devil!

183
00:09:46,931 --> 00:09:48,912
Don't touch me! Lay off me!

184
00:09:48,934 --> 00:09:50,744
I hate you. Fuck you!

185
00:09:50,771 --> 00:09:52,683
Fuck you both, you awful people.

186
00:09:52,707 --> 00:09:55,088
You're not my parents!
I hate you.

187
00:09:55,112 --> 00:09:58,892
I hate this house,
and I hate Christmas.

188
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:01,093
Not on Christmas.

189
00:10:01,122 --> 00:10:03,331
Not on Christmas.

190
00:10:09,537 --> 00:10:12,281
Get back in here,
Dawn Davenport!

191
00:10:12,308 --> 00:10:13,948
You're going to
a home for girls!

192
00:10:13,978 --> 00:10:15,481
That's where
we're gonna put you!

193
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:18,987
I'm calling the juvenile
authorities, right now!

194
00:10:23,495 --> 00:10:26,877
Have a merry, merry,
merry, merry Christmas

195
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:28,040
Merry Christmas

196
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,813
Have a hap, hap, hap,
hap, happy holiday

197
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:31,981
Merry Christmas

198
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,751
Get yourself into a glow

199
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:35,658
Underneath the mistletoe

200
00:10:50,008 --> 00:10:52,992
Get in, sugar dumplin'.

201
00:11:11,847 --> 00:11:13,486
Come on, honey! Hurry up!

202
00:11:13,516 --> 00:11:15,428
Come on!

203
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,874
Again.

204
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:44,548
Oh! I'm comin'!

205
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,246
Here it comes!
All right! Ready?

206
00:12:09,247 --> 00:12:11,694
Oh, fuck me, baby!
Fuck me! That's it!

207
00:12:11,717 --> 00:12:13,699
You like that, baby?
Oh, yeah!

208
00:12:24,908 --> 00:12:27,481
Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!

209
00:13:07,082 --> 00:13:08,652
Aw...fuck.

210
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,303
Is Earl Peterson there?

211
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:18,313
This is Dawn Davenport.
Dawn Davenport.

212
00:13:18,335 --> 00:13:21,250
You made love to me
Christmas morning.

213
00:13:21,273 --> 00:13:23,585
Well, I just wanted
to tell you...

214
00:13:23,611 --> 00:13:25,148
that I'm pregnant
and I want money.

215
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,289
You stole my wallet,
you fat bitch!

216
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:30,995
So what if I did?
I want money.

217
00:13:31,024 --> 00:13:33,335
You'll never get
any money from me, cow.

218
00:13:33,361 --> 00:13:35,274
Just 'cause you got
them big udders...

219
00:13:35,298 --> 00:13:36,778
don't mean you're
somethin' special.

220
00:13:36,801 --> 00:13:37,940
Get the hook.

221
00:13:37,969 --> 00:13:40,451
Go fuck yourself
for all I care.

222
00:13:40,474 --> 00:13:43,389
Yeah! Go fuck yourself!

223
00:14:21,947 --> 00:14:26,489
My little Taffy...
my little baby.

224
00:14:26,521 --> 00:14:27,694
Taffy.

225
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,920
Little Taffy.

226
00:16:23,894 --> 00:16:25,464
Mabel, Mabel

227
00:16:25,496 --> 00:16:26,806
Set the table

228
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,815
Don't forget the red

229
00:16:28,837 --> 00:16:30,214
Hot peppers

230
00:16:30,238 --> 00:16:32,015
Taffy, please stop it.

231
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:34,023
You're giving mother
a migraine.

232
00:16:34,045 --> 00:16:36,927
I can jump rope
if I feel like it.

233
00:16:36,951 --> 00:16:38,225
It's my house, too.

234
00:16:38,252 --> 00:16:40,861
You can jump rope
in the bathroom.

235
00:16:40,891 --> 00:16:43,566
You know it's not
big enough in there.

236
00:16:43,595 --> 00:16:45,372
Taffy, I have told you
repeatedly...

237
00:16:45,398 --> 00:16:47,971
no jumping rope
within 10 feet of me.

238
00:16:48,003 --> 00:16:52,079
Those same singsong rhymes
over and over...

239
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,216
are enough
to grate on my nerves.

240
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:56,251
Mabel, Mabel, set the table!

241
00:16:56,284 --> 00:16:57,491
Taffy, did you
hear your mother?!

242
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,592
Do you want another whippin'
with that car aerial?

243
00:16:59,623 --> 00:17:02,106
It's right in that closet,
don't forget.

244
00:17:02,128 --> 00:17:05,703
Maybe I'll stop it,
and maybe I won't.

245
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:08,809
Why can't I go to school?

246
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,717
Why can't I have friends?

247
00:17:10,742 --> 00:17:13,989
You can't go to school,
because I said so.

248
00:17:14,016 --> 00:17:16,554
I won't have you
nagging me for lunch money...

249
00:17:16,586 --> 00:17:18,363
and whining for help
on your homework.

250
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:21,236
There is no need to know
about the Presidents, wars...

251
00:17:21,261 --> 00:17:22,741
numbers, or science.

252
00:17:22,764 --> 00:17:25,246
Just listen to me,
and you'll learn.

253
00:17:25,268 --> 00:17:29,083
And no little friends
over here repeating rhymes...

254
00:17:29,108 --> 00:17:30,645
asking flippant questions...

255
00:17:30,678 --> 00:17:33,593
and talking in those
nagging baby voices.

256
00:17:33,616 --> 00:17:36,656
Can't you just sit there
and look out into the air?

257
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:37,828
Isn't that enough?

258
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:40,430
Do you always have to
badger me for attention?

259
00:17:40,461 --> 00:17:41,634
Mabel, Mabel

260
00:17:41,663 --> 00:17:42,939
God damn you, Taffy!

261
00:17:42,967 --> 00:17:45,107
Now you're gonna get it.

262
00:17:45,136 --> 00:17:47,708
Where's that thing? Come here!

263
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,016
What are you doing?

264
00:17:49,043 --> 00:17:50,956
Now, I'm gonna kill you!

265
00:17:50,981 --> 00:17:52,619
Can you help us?

266
00:17:52,649 --> 00:17:53,789
We got a huge purse.

267
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:54,958
Sure, girls.
Put it in the closet.

268
00:17:54,988 --> 00:17:57,299
Nobody saw you bring
that stuff in here, did they?

269
00:17:57,324 --> 00:17:58,463
No. We got it
right down the street.

270
00:17:58,493 --> 00:17:59,632
Nobody was home.

271
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:00,971
Oh, good. Sit down.

272
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:03,810
You're lucky
they came in here, Miss Taffy!

273
00:18:03,836 --> 00:18:06,911
We oughta get 10 bucks each
just for the TV.

274
00:18:06,942 --> 00:18:08,285
Hi, there, Taffy.

275
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,087
She's been a hideous
little girl today.

276
00:18:10,114 --> 00:18:11,594
She was about to get
a good whippin'.

277
00:18:11,616 --> 00:18:13,096
She looks so cute.

278
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,260
Who are you...ugly7

279
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,430
You know who they are.

280
00:18:17,459 --> 00:18:19,099
I've never seen them before.

281
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,268
Oh, Taffy.

282
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:22,941
I just saw you yesterday, Taffy.

283
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,076
Come sit here with
your Aunt Chicklette.

284
00:18:25,106 --> 00:18:28,784
Oh, my God! This kid's
bitin' me. Get off!

285
00:18:28,813 --> 00:18:31,455
Taffy, I can't stand it.
You little brat!

286
00:18:31,484 --> 00:18:36,164
She's gettin' tied to her bed
for a week for this.

287
00:18:36,193 --> 00:18:39,005
Oh, my God, listen to you!

288
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:41,137
You hideous little brat!

289
00:18:41,168 --> 00:18:43,480
She'll never escape this time.

290
00:18:43,505 --> 00:18:45,315
All right, come on.

291
00:18:47,245 --> 00:18:49,750
Brat, shut your hole!

292
00:18:49,783 --> 00:18:52,322
You're gonna pay for it.
Get on that bed.

293
00:18:52,355 --> 00:18:53,493
Shut...

294
00:18:53,522 --> 00:18:55,663
Shut up, Taffy!

295
00:18:55,693 --> 00:18:57,732
Shut up! Gettin' on our nerves.

296
00:18:57,764 --> 00:19:00,337
I don't know what I was thinkin'
about when I had her.

297
00:19:00,369 --> 00:19:02,851
I don't know why you
take that shit from her.

298
00:19:02,873 --> 00:19:04,182
I'll never have another one.

299
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:07,090
What a horrible little kid,
that goddamn little shit.

300
00:19:07,114 --> 00:19:09,289
I don't know how you
take it anyway, Dawn.

301
00:19:09,318 --> 00:19:11,162
She bit my arm.

302
00:19:11,187 --> 00:19:13,135
That child's becoming a monster.

303
00:19:13,158 --> 00:19:16,630
You can't imagine. Whining
and demanding attention...

304
00:19:16,663 --> 00:19:21,741
and shrieking those same stupid
jump-rope chants day and night.

305
00:19:21,773 --> 00:19:23,185
Give me that jump rope.
Where is it?

306
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,347
I'll get that rope.

307
00:19:24,377 --> 00:19:25,516
Oh, thanks, honey.

308
00:19:25,546 --> 00:19:27,652
- Give me those scissors.
- Here.

309
00:19:27,682 --> 00:19:30,723
I've about had it
with this jump rope.

310
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:32,828
That's the last time...

311
00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:35,170
she's gonna jump
with this goddamn thing.

312
00:19:35,196 --> 00:19:36,505
Ah! I hate it!

313
00:19:38,701 --> 00:19:40,945
I'm glad I had an abortion.

314
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:42,851
Maybe she needs more punishment.

315
00:19:42,876 --> 00:19:45,051
I've done everything
a mother can do.

316
00:19:45,081 --> 00:19:46,492
I've locked her in her room.

317
00:19:46,515 --> 00:19:47,860
I've beat her
with the car aerial.

318
00:19:47,885 --> 00:19:49,331
Nothing changes her.

319
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,357
It's hard being a loving mother.

320
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:54,533
I give her free food,
a bed, clean underpants.

321
00:19:54,563 --> 00:19:56,374
What does she expect?

322
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,010
I can't beat her little
baby butt all the time.

323
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,611
Just get your hair done
tomorrow...

324
00:20:01,642 --> 00:20:02,781
and you'll feel better.

325
00:20:02,811 --> 00:20:05,225
That's what I always do
when I get depressed.

326
00:20:05,249 --> 00:20:07,196
Maybe I will.

327
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:11,170
I'll tell ya, the Lipstick
Beauty Salon is the best.

328
00:20:11,192 --> 00:20:14,734
They only let, well, you know,
special girls in.

329
00:20:14,766 --> 00:20:17,247
You have to audition
to even get your hair done.

330
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:21,085
And there's this guy
that does hair there.

331
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:24,582
I'd suck the socks
off him in a minute.

332
00:20:24,616 --> 00:20:26,929
Yeah, Gator's his name,
and you know what?

333
00:20:26,954 --> 00:20:28,764
He lives right next-door.

334
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,600
Wonder what his stow is.

335
00:20:30,627 --> 00:20:32,107
Maybe he's a...

336
00:20:32,129 --> 00:20:33,666
Shelly Chaser.

337
00:20:38,641 --> 00:20:41,453
Aunt Ida. Aunt Ida.

338
00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:42,960
You really like it?

339
00:20:42,982 --> 00:20:45,088
Yeah. All right, Aunt Ida.

340
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,070
Aunt Ida! Aunt Ida, all right.

341
00:20:49,092 --> 00:20:50,835
Don't you look sweet.

342
00:20:52,766 --> 00:20:55,214
Yeah! Aunt Ida.

343
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:59,086
Yeah! All right,Aunt Ida.
Don't you look hot today?

344
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,988
Why, thank ya, honey.

345
00:21:01,013 --> 00:21:02,357
I feel more...

346
00:21:04,652 --> 00:21:06,760
...more comfortable.

347
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:09,272
Pour me a drink, would ya?

348
00:21:09,294 --> 00:21:10,535
Sure, Aunt Ida.

349
00:21:10,563 --> 00:21:12,135
What would you like?

350
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:13,909
Sherry.

351
00:21:13,936 --> 00:21:17,944
Have you met
any nice boys in the salon?

352
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:19,286
They're all pretty nice.

353
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:21,452
I mean any nice queer boys.

354
00:21:21,482 --> 00:21:23,361
Do you fool with any of 'em?

355
00:21:23,386 --> 00:21:25,594
Aunt Ida, you know I dig women.

356
00:21:25,623 --> 00:21:27,627
Aw, don't tell me that.

357
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,733
Christ, let's not
go through this again.

358
00:21:29,764 --> 00:21:32,940
All those beauticians, and you
don't have any boy dates?

359
00:21:32,969 --> 00:21:35,144
I don't want any boy dates.

360
00:21:35,173 --> 00:21:38,156
Oh, honey, I'd be so happy
if you'd turn Nellie.

361
00:21:38,178 --> 00:21:40,319
There ain't no way.
I'm straight.

362
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:41,829
I mean, I like
a lot of queers...

363
00:21:41,852 --> 00:21:43,834
but I don't dig
their equipment, you know?

364
00:21:43,856 --> 00:21:45,165
I like women.

365
00:21:45,191 --> 00:21:46,865
But you could change.

366
00:21:46,894 --> 00:21:48,340
Queers are just better.

367
00:21:48,363 --> 00:21:50,503
I'd be so proud
if you was a fag...

368
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:53,176
and had a nice
beautician boyfriend.

369
00:21:53,205 --> 00:21:55,186
I'd never have to worry.

370
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,520
There ain't nothin'
to worry about.

371
00:21:57,545 --> 00:22:02,362
I worry that you'll work
in an office, have children...

372
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:04,768
celebrate wedding anniversaries.

373
00:22:04,793 --> 00:22:09,245
The world of heterosexual
is a sick and boring life.

374
00:22:09,267 --> 00:22:11,305
Sometimes I think
you're fuckin' crazy.

375
00:22:11,337 --> 00:22:13,911
I'm real happy
just the way I am.

376
00:22:13,941 --> 00:22:16,150
Aw, let me bleach your hair out.

377
00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:18,251
Let's go down
to Wagon Wheel Bar.

378
00:22:18,282 --> 00:22:20,594
I know there's some
nice boys there for you.

379
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:22,692
You are fuckin' nuts,
Aunt Ida.

380
00:22:22,724 --> 00:22:25,502
I gotta get to work.
Don't you worry about me.

381
00:22:25,528 --> 00:22:27,236
Sex ain't no problem.

382
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:29,542
See you after
my last wash-and-set.

383
00:22:29,569 --> 00:22:30,844
OK, honey.

384
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:48,540
Oh, God, I love hairdressers.

385
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:49,742
More.

386
00:23:11,042 --> 00:23:15,425
Good morning, staff, and hello
to all the lovely ladies...

387
00:23:15,449 --> 00:23:17,328
of the Lipstick Beauty Salon.

388
00:23:17,352 --> 00:23:19,356
What a beautiful couple.

389
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,528
Thanks, Butter.

390
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:23,201
That's a gorgeous outfit,
Mrs. Dasher.

391
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,370
- It must be an original.
- It is.

392
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,383
- Bet it cost a fortune.
- It did.

393
00:23:28,405 --> 00:23:30,216
Striking, aren't they?

394
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,416
- So chic.
- No kidding.

395
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:36,222
Good morning, Mr. Dasher.

396
00:23:36,252 --> 00:23:39,065
You look breathtaking today,
Mrs. Dasher.

397
00:23:39,091 --> 00:23:40,331
Thank you, Vikki.

398
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:42,238
There's some applicants
for appointments here.

399
00:23:42,263 --> 00:23:43,572
Would you like to view them?

400
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:45,672
Anyone particularly appalling?

401
00:23:45,703 --> 00:23:47,581
Well, yes, there is
a Dawn Davenport.

402
00:23:47,606 --> 00:23:50,749
She seems especially cheap.
You may like her.

403
00:23:50,778 --> 00:23:52,952
At ease! Back to work!

404
00:23:52,982 --> 00:23:55,123
Yes, Mrs. Dasher.

405
00:23:55,152 --> 00:23:57,099
All right, girls.
Come on. Line up.

406
00:23:57,122 --> 00:23:58,261
Here's your big chance.

407
00:23:58,291 --> 00:24:00,102
Here they are, Mr. Dasher.

408
00:24:00,128 --> 00:24:02,609
Back over there
so we can see you.

409
00:24:02,632 --> 00:24:04,773
Oh, my God! Look at that one!

410
00:24:04,802 --> 00:24:06,043
She's just putrid!

411
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:07,882
You! Go on! Get out!

412
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:09,787
You heard her. Beat it.

413
00:24:09,811 --> 00:24:11,656
Go on, doll. Get out.

414
00:24:11,682 --> 00:24:14,220
Forgive me, Donald.
I couldn't help it.

415
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,564
There has to be a line
drawn somewhere.

416
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,298
You are quite right, Donna.

417
00:24:18,326 --> 00:24:20,569
You see, we are
a private salon...

418
00:24:20,597 --> 00:24:22,772
catering to
ravishing beauties only.

419
00:24:22,801 --> 00:24:24,805
Even one average customer...

420
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,183
would be enough to plummet
our reputation forever...

421
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:30,589
so we must pick and choose
with great care.

422
00:24:30,614 --> 00:24:33,689
Firstly, I'd like to know
your occupations.

423
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,257
I'm a stripper.

424
00:24:35,289 --> 00:24:37,271
And I work for
the telephone company.

425
00:24:37,293 --> 00:24:39,433
- Disqualified.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

426
00:24:39,463 --> 00:24:41,274
May we suggest
Mr. Ray's Wig World?

427
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,440
What's the matter
with the telephone company?

428
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:46,453
I believe my husband
is asking the questions.

429
00:24:46,475 --> 00:24:47,614
Go on! Get out!

430
00:24:47,644 --> 00:24:48,954
Get out of my beauty salon!

431
00:24:48,981 --> 00:24:50,119
Beat it, hon.

432
00:24:50,148 --> 00:24:52,289
And you, Miss...

433
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:53,924
Davenport.

434
00:24:53,955 --> 00:24:55,664
Dawn Davenport.

435
00:24:55,692 --> 00:24:58,971
I'm a thief
and a shitkicker, and...

436
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,569
I'd like to be famous.

437
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,137
I see.

438
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:03,844
You're quite striking.

439
00:25:03,873 --> 00:25:07,756
We are always curious
as to what drew you here...

440
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,385
to Les Lipstick.

441
00:25:09,416 --> 00:25:11,989
Well, I heard all
the strippers come here...

442
00:25:12,021 --> 00:25:14,400
and I got sick of my old salon.

443
00:25:14,424 --> 00:25:16,668
And supposing
we become sick of you?

444
00:25:16,696 --> 00:25:19,200
Well, I had hoped
that wouldn't happen.

445
00:25:19,233 --> 00:25:21,112
Well, I think
it is happening.

446
00:25:21,137 --> 00:25:24,279
It's hard to explain, but
when I look into your face...

447
00:25:24,308 --> 00:25:26,722
I pick up a distinct feeling
of nausea.

448
00:25:26,746 --> 00:25:27,953
Hey, wait a minute!

449
00:25:27,982 --> 00:25:29,462
Disqualified.

450
00:25:29,484 --> 00:25:31,294
Raising your voice to my wife.

451
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,803
In this shop,
her wish is my command.

452
00:25:33,826 --> 00:25:36,467
May I suggest
Mr. Ray's Wig World?

453
00:25:36,496 --> 00:25:39,138
What is she, some kind
of princess or something?

454
00:25:39,168 --> 00:25:40,649
Princess Perfect.

455
00:25:40,671 --> 00:25:42,778
Hey, get the fuck out!

456
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:44,812
Oh, Mrs. Dasher,
I'm awfully sorry.

457
00:25:44,845 --> 00:25:46,758
The Better Business Bureau
will hear from me!

458
00:25:46,782 --> 00:25:47,920
Just get out!

459
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,555
Attention!

460
00:25:49,586 --> 00:25:51,498
Staff, this is
our new customer...

461
00:25:51,522 --> 00:25:54,062
Miss Dawn Davenport.

462
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:55,666
This is Dribbles...

463
00:25:55,697 --> 00:25:57,177
Wink...

464
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,909
Gator...

465
00:25:58,937 --> 00:26:00,314
and Butterfly.

466
00:26:00,338 --> 00:26:02,081
He's been here the longest.

467
00:26:02,109 --> 00:26:04,522
I'd like to have Gator,
if it would be all right.

468
00:26:04,545 --> 00:26:05,685
Certainly.

469
00:26:05,715 --> 00:26:08,630
Gator, see to it
that Miss Davenport...

470
00:26:08,653 --> 00:26:10,657
is well taken care of.

471
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:18,409
Ooh, Gator, I've heard
so much about you.

472
00:26:18,437 --> 00:26:19,576
Could somebody run and get me...

473
00:26:19,606 --> 00:26:21,314
a double egg salad
on white toast?

474
00:26:21,342 --> 00:26:23,017
Certainly, Dawn.

475
00:29:12,943 --> 00:29:16,155
Can't you put down
those damn magazines?

476
00:29:16,183 --> 00:29:17,822
I like these damn magazines.

477
00:29:17,852 --> 00:29:19,526
Better than me, I suppose?

478
00:29:19,555 --> 00:29:21,628
No, just about
the same in my book.

479
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,698
Oh, can't we do it normal?

480
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:25,732
This is normal.

481
00:29:27,903 --> 00:29:29,439
Get my tool kit.

482
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,476
Get it yourself.

483
00:29:35,516 --> 00:29:37,725
You want the hammer today, Dawn?

484
00:29:37,753 --> 00:29:39,529
Huh? Huh?

485
00:29:39,556 --> 00:29:40,832
We can try the hack saw.

486
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,203
That would be
something different.

487
00:29:42,228 --> 00:29:43,834
No! Not the hammer, Gator!

488
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,538
Use the needle-nose pliers!

489
00:29:45,566 --> 00:29:48,175
Oh, you asked for it, baby.

490
00:29:58,356 --> 00:30:02,330
Oh, my God! Look at you two,
caught right in the very act!

491
00:30:02,363 --> 00:30:05,074
Isn't that a pretty sight?

492
00:30:05,102 --> 00:30:06,707
Taffy, go to your room.

493
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,377
Hey, Taffy, baby, cool down.

494
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:09,716
Come on over here
with your daddy.

495
00:30:09,743 --> 00:30:11,519
Don't you talk to her like that.

496
00:30:11,546 --> 00:30:16,363
You're not my daddy,
you disgusting, hippie pig.

497
00:30:16,388 --> 00:30:17,925
And I wouldn't get near a bed...

498
00:30:17,957 --> 00:30:20,462
that had been defiled
by the likes of you two.

499
00:30:20,495 --> 00:30:23,239
I'd sooner
jump in a river of snot.

500
00:30:23,266 --> 00:30:24,611
Well, go jump, then!

501
00:30:24,636 --> 00:30:27,619
Go kill yourself
and do us all a favor!

502
00:30:27,641 --> 00:30:30,486
Hey, Taffy, baby,
come suck your daddy's dick.

503
00:30:30,512 --> 00:30:33,394
I wouldn't suck your lousy dick
if I was suffocating...

504
00:30:33,418 --> 00:30:36,732
and there was oxygen
in your balls!

505
00:30:36,757 --> 00:30:38,669
You pay some respect
to your mother, Miss Taffy.

506
00:30:38,694 --> 00:30:41,302
And if I catch you spying
and nosing around here...

507
00:30:41,332 --> 00:30:45,477
one more time, I'm going to put
you in the mental hospital.

508
00:30:45,505 --> 00:30:47,452
She can't help it.
She's retarded.

509
00:30:47,475 --> 00:30:49,583
I am not retarded!

510
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,423
Oh, yes, you are, Taffy.

511
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:53,864
I had you tested when you
were a little girl.

512
00:30:53,887 --> 00:30:56,129
A staff of doctors examined you.

513
00:30:56,157 --> 00:30:58,537
And maybe the reason
you don't remember...

514
00:30:58,563 --> 00:31:02,012
is that they told me you
are most definitely retarded.

515
00:31:02,035 --> 00:31:05,918
I never went to any hospital.
That is a rotten, filthy lie!

516
00:31:05,942 --> 00:31:07,182
I'm afraid it's the truth.

517
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,419
I don't like it
any better than you do.

518
00:31:09,447 --> 00:31:12,693
To think that my genes
were polluted by your birth...

519
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,496
is not a very pleasant thought.

520
00:31:14,523 --> 00:31:16,630
Oh, how could
I call you my mother?

521
00:31:16,661 --> 00:31:18,505
I wish I'd been an orphan!

522
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:21,206
You can tell she's retarded.
Look at her face.

523
00:31:21,235 --> 00:31:22,978
She has the face
of an old woman.

524
00:31:23,005 --> 00:31:26,216
Oh, it's true.
Look in the mirror, Taffy.

525
00:31:26,244 --> 00:31:28,418
For 14, you don't look so good.

526
00:31:28,447 --> 00:31:32,091
It's because you've been
such a brat all your life...

527
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,798
that now, all that brattishness
is showing in your face...

528
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:38,002
the face of a retarded brat.

529
00:31:38,031 --> 00:31:42,278
Yes, sirree, that's a real time
warp of a face you got there.

530
00:31:42,305 --> 00:31:43,650
What do you know
about anything?

531
00:31:43,675 --> 00:31:46,520
Some of the faces I've seen you
with could stop a train.

532
00:31:46,547 --> 00:31:48,356
Give me $10.

533
00:31:48,382 --> 00:31:49,988
Awfully demanding, aren't you?

534
00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:52,558
Give me $10,
or I'm calling the police.

535
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,195
It's as simple as that.

536
00:31:54,226 --> 00:31:58,645
And don't think I'd hesitate to
put you two slobs behind bars...

537
00:31:58,668 --> 00:32:01,411
for the rest of your lives.

538
00:32:01,438 --> 00:32:03,546
What would you do with $107

539
00:32:03,577 --> 00:32:04,954
Writing a book, hippie?

540
00:32:04,978 --> 00:32:06,481
Why don't you go listen
to some folk music...

541
00:32:06,514 --> 00:32:07,927
and give me a break?!

542
00:32:07,951 --> 00:32:10,934
Taffy Davenport!
Give her the money.

543
00:32:10,956 --> 00:32:12,095
What?

544
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:14,333
You heard me!
I said give her the $10.

545
00:32:27,886 --> 00:32:29,594
You digging it, baby?

546
00:32:35,866 --> 00:32:38,143
Real funny, Gator!

547
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:40,585
You should have seen your face.

548
00:32:40,608 --> 00:32:41,985
I've had it with you!

549
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,117
Why don't you just get out?

550
00:32:44,147 --> 00:32:47,460
Go back to your fat aunt
and leave me alone!

551
00:32:47,486 --> 00:32:50,367
I got off on it.
I really got off on it.

552
00:32:50,391 --> 00:32:53,273
Oh, did you?
Well, hip, hip, hooray...

553
00:32:53,297 --> 00:32:54,936
for your cheap climax.

554
00:32:54,966 --> 00:32:57,175
What about me, fuck face?!

555
00:32:57,204 --> 00:33:00,278
Some pitiful excuse for
a husband you turned out to be.

556
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:03,190
Why don't you just go
take your fucking tool kit...

557
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:04,957
and go fuck a garage?

558
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:06,520
I'm gonna get my hair done.

559
00:33:06,553 --> 00:33:07,965
I couldn't help it.

560
00:33:07,989 --> 00:33:10,300
If you could have seen
the expression on your face.

561
00:33:10,326 --> 00:33:12,809
I thought I'd piss myself when I
seen that carrot in your mouth.

562
00:33:12,831 --> 00:33:15,073
It's a weird joint,
ain't it, Dawn?

563
00:33:15,101 --> 00:33:17,744
You're cut off
for 2 weeks for this.

564
00:33:17,773 --> 00:33:21,986
And don't-just don't even speak
to me at the salon, either.

565
00:33:22,014 --> 00:33:25,726
Just pretend we don't
know one another.

566
00:33:31,998 --> 00:33:34,276
That will be $104, please.

567
00:33:34,302 --> 00:33:36,580
For a wash-and-set?

568
00:33:36,606 --> 00:33:38,781
Well, I don't know what
you're accustomed to...

569
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:41,759
in good grooming, but this
is the Lipstick Beauty Salon...

570
00:33:41,782 --> 00:33:44,423
and not some bargain-basement
beauty school.

571
00:33:44,452 --> 00:33:45,592
That's outrageous!

572
00:33:45,622 --> 00:33:48,502
I won't pay that
for a wash-and-set.

573
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,702
Well, give us
the hairdo back, then.

574
00:33:50,731 --> 00:33:53,008
What are you talking about?

575
00:33:53,035 --> 00:33:55,779
Boys, she won't pay.
Take the hairdo back.

576
00:33:55,806 --> 00:33:57,879
What do you mean
she won't pay?

577
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,323
Won't pay? Slut! Come here!

578
00:34:00,347 --> 00:34:01,726
Don't take that.

579
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,889
Pay for the goddamn hair...

580
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:05,264
I ought to rip your face off!

581
00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:06,531
Get out of my salon!

582
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,095
Don't ever set foot
in here again...

583
00:34:08,127 --> 00:34:10,610
or I'll put your little
plastic surgery in reverse!

584
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:12,203
Now get out!

585
00:34:12,234 --> 00:34:13,613
I'm sorry I made you wait.

586
00:34:13,638 --> 00:34:16,142
We had some trouble
up at front.

587
00:34:16,175 --> 00:34:17,520
What does she think this is?

588
00:34:17,545 --> 00:34:19,219
Sorry for the interruption,
Sally.

589
00:34:19,247 --> 00:34:21,250
You're one
of my prettiest customers.

590
00:34:21,284 --> 00:34:23,027
Oh, shut up, Dribbles.

591
00:34:23,054 --> 00:34:26,196
The things a woman has to go
through to get some height.

592
00:34:26,226 --> 00:34:27,605
How's your little girl?

593
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:30,043
Why don't you
bring her in more often?

594
00:34:30,066 --> 00:34:32,639
Why, so you can undress her
again with your eyes?

595
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:34,983
Christ sake,
she's only 6 years old.

596
00:34:35,009 --> 00:34:38,322
I know...but I just like
to play with her.

597
00:34:38,347 --> 00:34:39,987
I wish I was a little girl.

598
00:34:40,018 --> 00:34:41,862
Well,throw a goddamn penny
in a fountain...

599
00:34:41,887 --> 00:34:44,597
and make a goddamn wish,
and maybe it'll come true.

600
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:47,267
So I told her, "You can keep
your fuckin' $10."

601
00:34:47,296 --> 00:34:50,438
I can steal $10 faster
than they can make it.

602
00:34:50,468 --> 00:34:52,381
What's the big deal
about money?

603
00:34:52,406 --> 00:34:55,879
It's so easy to get, I can't
imagine why anybody works.

604
00:34:55,912 --> 00:34:58,257
It boggles my imagination.

605
00:34:58,282 --> 00:35:01,060
Well, maybe everybody's not
a common thief like you.

606
00:35:01,087 --> 00:35:04,834
Butterfly, you tired thing,
we are anything but common.

607
00:35:04,861 --> 00:35:07,969
I love the smell of shampoo.

608
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,505
We are upper-echelon
cat burglars...

609
00:35:10,538 --> 00:35:14,044
and don't you forget it,
Mr. Butterfly.

610
00:35:14,077 --> 00:35:15,581
Of course,
I think I like the smell...

611
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,060
of Clairol cream
conditioner better.

612
00:35:18,084 --> 00:35:20,259
You know, when it's on
a freshly bleached head?

613
00:35:20,288 --> 00:35:22,326
I don't know.
I like them both, but...

614
00:35:22,357 --> 00:35:23,497
Shut up.

615
00:35:23,527 --> 00:35:24,905
Don't pay them any mind,Wink.

616
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:27,845
They wouldn't know beauty
if they fell over it.

617
00:35:27,868 --> 00:35:29,348
Oh, hi, Dawn.

618
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:30,748
Good morning, Vikki.

619
00:35:30,773 --> 00:35:32,755
I'd like my hair done
quickly and quietly.

620
00:35:32,777 --> 00:35:34,587
Why, sure, hon.
You want Gator?

621
00:35:34,613 --> 00:35:36,321
Is he here today?
You want him to do it?

622
00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:38,627
No, I don't, Vikki,
and if you must know...

623
00:35:38,653 --> 00:35:40,292
I'm thinking of a divorce...

624
00:35:40,323 --> 00:35:42,361
so please don't ever mention
his name to me again.

625
00:35:42,392 --> 00:35:45,103
I'm sorry to hear that, Dawn.
Is he here today?

626
00:35:45,132 --> 00:35:47,238
I'm really not
aware of his schedule.

627
00:35:47,268 --> 00:35:48,407
Please! Really!

628
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,941
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

629
00:35:49,974 --> 00:35:51,419
I know what
you're going through.

630
00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:54,051
I really do.
But they're all bastards!

631
00:35:54,081 --> 00:35:55,527
Cheer up. You don't need him.

632
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,554
It's all right. It's OK.

633
00:35:57,587 --> 00:35:59,534
Just get somebody
to set my hair, please.

634
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:01,971
Sure, hon.
Excuse me a minute, hon.

635
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:03,167
Sure.

636
00:36:05,568 --> 00:36:07,515
Why, yes, she's right here.

637
00:36:07,538 --> 00:36:09,018
Why, certainly.

638
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,645
That was Mr. Dasher, Dawn.

639
00:36:10,676 --> 00:36:12,885
He want to see you in private.

640
00:36:12,914 --> 00:36:15,191
No one has ever
been back there before.

641
00:36:15,217 --> 00:36:17,096
It must be something big.

642
00:36:17,121 --> 00:36:18,760
Oh, and I look a mess.

643
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,236
Get fixed up, hon.

644
00:36:20,259 --> 00:36:22,572
Oh...thanks a lot, Vikki.

645
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:24,134
Good luck.

646
00:36:24,166 --> 00:36:27,377
Hi, Sally. Hi, Concetta.
Hey, Wink.

647
00:36:27,405 --> 00:36:29,820
Hi. Well, good-bye.
I've got to go.

648
00:36:29,844 --> 00:36:32,121
I can't talk to you now.
I've got to go see Mr. Dasher.

649
00:36:32,147 --> 00:36:33,320
See you later.

650
00:36:36,187 --> 00:36:36,723
Come in.

651
00:36:39,292 --> 00:36:40,465
In here.

652
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,078
Good to see you, Dawn.

653
00:36:46,105 --> 00:36:47,244
Hello, Mr. Dasher.

654
00:36:47,274 --> 00:36:49,050
It's a privilege
to have you here.

655
00:36:49,077 --> 00:36:50,216
A sip of soda?

656
00:36:50,246 --> 00:36:51,692
Oh, thank you.

657
00:36:53,217 --> 00:36:55,564
Hmm. But I don't
understand this honor.

658
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:57,432
You will in time,
Miss Davenport.

659
00:36:57,458 --> 00:36:58,598
Have a seat, won't you?

660
00:36:58,628 --> 00:37:00,005
Oh, thank you.

661
00:37:01,499 --> 00:37:03,207
My wife and I--and please...

662
00:37:03,235 --> 00:37:05,774
do call us Donald
and Donna from now on...

663
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,481
are wondering if you
wouldn't be interested...

664
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,821
in becoming involved
in show business.

665
00:37:09,847 --> 00:37:11,259
Show business?!

666
00:37:11,283 --> 00:37:13,389
Well, sort of show business.

667
00:37:13,419 --> 00:37:16,334
You see, Dawn, we're planning
a little experiment...

668
00:37:16,357 --> 00:37:18,738
a beauty experiment,
you could call it...

669
00:37:18,763 --> 00:37:20,607
and we want you
to be our model.

670
00:37:20,632 --> 00:37:23,707
Sort of a glamorous
guinea pig,you might say.

671
00:37:23,738 --> 00:37:25,308
A beauty experiment?

672
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,049
You see, my husband and I...

673
00:37:27,077 --> 00:37:29,388
enjoy taking pictures
a great deal.

674
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:32,421
We'd like you to pose
for some rather unusual shots.

675
00:37:32,453 --> 00:37:35,061
Oh-ho, you mean pornography.

676
00:37:35,091 --> 00:37:36,538
Certainly not!

677
00:37:36,561 --> 00:37:38,438
Sex is not one
of our interests.

678
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:40,001
As a matter of fact...

679
00:37:40,033 --> 00:37:41,672
one of the rules
you must always obey...

680
00:37:41,703 --> 00:37:44,117
is to never mention
the sex act in front of us.

681
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,622
We find the subject
most repellent...

682
00:37:46,645 --> 00:37:49,924
and we must ask you to observe
this rule at all times.

683
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:53,025
You should know that we view sex
as a violation of the spirit...

684
00:37:53,055 --> 00:37:56,198
and we would certainly never
allow ourselves to be caught...

685
00:37:56,228 --> 00:37:58,608
in one of those
ludicrous positions.

686
00:37:58,632 --> 00:38:00,511
Oh, of course,
of course. I'm so sorry.

687
00:38:00,536 --> 00:38:01,947
I really didn't know.

688
00:38:01,971 --> 00:38:03,509
Are you still a thief, Dawn?

689
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:05,954
Yes, I am. Not as much
as I used to be...

690
00:38:05,978 --> 00:38:07,550
but I still rob houses.

691
00:38:07,582 --> 00:38:08,960
With those other two?

692
00:38:08,984 --> 00:38:11,261
Yes, Chicklette and Concetta.

693
00:38:11,287 --> 00:38:13,826
Would you allow us
to take some photos of you...

694
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:15,636
committing various crimes?

695
00:38:15,662 --> 00:38:17,643
Crimes that tickled our fancy?

696
00:38:17,665 --> 00:38:19,510
I--I guess so.

697
00:38:19,536 --> 00:38:22,883
You see, our experiment involves
beauty and crime.

698
00:38:22,908 --> 00:38:24,947
We feel them to be one.

699
00:38:24,979 --> 00:38:28,326
We have a theory that crime
enhances one's beauty.

700
00:38:28,351 --> 00:38:31,528
The worse the crime gets,
the more ravishing one becomes.

701
00:38:31,557 --> 00:38:33,766
We want you to prove us right.

702
00:38:33,795 --> 00:38:35,172
Say yes, Dawn.

703
00:38:35,196 --> 00:38:37,439
Aren't you sick
of getting your hair done?

704
00:38:37,468 --> 00:38:39,449
Don't you want
the throbbing excitement...

705
00:38:39,471 --> 00:38:40,974
of a modeling career?

706
00:38:41,007 --> 00:38:43,717
We'll give you a new look,
an interest in life...

707
00:38:43,745 --> 00:38:45,727
and together,
we could overcome...

708
00:38:45,749 --> 00:38:48,891
this boredom
that imprisons us all.

709
00:38:48,921 --> 00:38:51,402
Well, I'd love to have
the two of you take my photos...

710
00:38:51,424 --> 00:38:53,337
but I won't get arrested,
will I?

711
00:38:53,361 --> 00:38:55,934
The police department
will not be involved.

712
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:59,439
And any special favors,
well, don't hesitate to ask.

713
00:38:59,473 --> 00:39:01,853
Well, there is one thing.

714
00:39:01,877 --> 00:39:03,448
Ask, and you shall receive.

715
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,619
Fire my husband.

716
00:39:04,648 --> 00:39:05,787
Gator?

717
00:39:05,817 --> 00:39:07,421
Yes! I want a divorce!

718
00:39:12,194 --> 00:39:14,541
Vikki, this is Mr. Dasher.

719
00:39:14,566 --> 00:39:17,481
Uh, please fire Gator.

720
00:39:17,505 --> 00:39:19,543
No reason. Yes.

721
00:39:19,574 --> 00:39:22,056
Tell him no reason at all.

722
00:39:24,215 --> 00:39:25,662
Look who's coming out now.

723
00:39:25,685 --> 00:39:28,566
Hey, fatso, I want
to talk to you a second.

724
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,195
Just speak to my attorney.

725
00:39:30,226 --> 00:39:32,207
Hey! Did you get me fired?

726
00:39:32,229 --> 00:39:34,473
Maybe I did,
and maybe I didn't.

727
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:37,242
Shut up!

728
00:39:43,283 --> 00:39:45,822
Look out!
Look out! Look out!

729
00:39:58,977 --> 00:40:00,821
How many times
have I told you...

730
00:40:00,846 --> 00:40:03,830
to play car accident
outside?!

731
00:40:03,852 --> 00:40:06,596
Oh! Oh, mother!
It was a horrible accident!

732
00:40:06,624 --> 00:40:07,968
Look at my friend!

733
00:40:07,993 --> 00:40:09,131
She was in the death seat...

734
00:40:09,161 --> 00:40:11,200
and her head got caught
in the windshield!

735
00:40:11,232 --> 00:40:13,737
Oh, the ambulance should
be here soon, I think.

736
00:40:13,769 --> 00:40:16,411
I'm OK...I guess...

737
00:40:16,442 --> 00:40:18,582
Oh! it wasn't my fault!

738
00:40:18,612 --> 00:40:20,286
The other car
came out of nowhere...

739
00:40:20,314 --> 00:40:22,192
and I--I slammed
on the brakes.

740
00:40:22,217 --> 00:40:24,062
Look at this mess, Taffy!

741
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,504
Broken glass and ketchup
all over my fine furniture!

742
00:40:27,527 --> 00:40:31,444
Call another ambulance!
Call anybody!

743
00:40:31,468 --> 00:40:34,576
Help me...

744
00:40:34,606 --> 00:40:36,986
Where did you
get this crap, Taffy?

745
00:40:37,011 --> 00:40:39,185
I told you to spend that money
I gave you on a cute outfit.

746
00:40:39,214 --> 00:40:41,696
But oh, no!
as soon as my back is turned...

747
00:40:41,718 --> 00:40:44,030
you run right out
and spend it on props...

748
00:40:44,056 --> 00:40:45,434
for your morbid little games.

749
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:47,336
Well, I want it
cleaned up, pronto!

750
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:48,603
We're having guests
for dinner...

751
00:40:48,631 --> 00:40:50,771
and I want you
on tiptop behavior...

752
00:40:50,801 --> 00:40:54,547
and looking as p-r-e-t-t-y
as humanly possible.

753
00:40:54,574 --> 00:40:56,647
Who's coming to dinner?

754
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:59,457
Donald and Donna Dasher
are going to join us...

755
00:40:59,483 --> 00:41:01,395
for a small, informal buffet.

756
00:41:01,421 --> 00:41:03,959
And if you dare to embarrass me
in front of them...

757
00:41:03,991 --> 00:41:06,302
If I have to eat with Gator,
I'll spit food!

758
00:41:06,328 --> 00:41:07,707
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to be the one...

759
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:09,370
to break the news
to you, Taffy.

760
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,178
I've thrown Gator out
and started divorce proceedings.

761
00:41:12,205 --> 00:41:15,051
I don't want to seem overly
bitter, but I'd appreciate it...

762
00:41:15,077 --> 00:41:16,922
if you would destroy
all of his belongings.

763
00:41:16,947 --> 00:41:20,089
Well, hallelujah.

764
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:23,125
I'd be happy to, mother.

765
00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:29,508
I'm going to go
sink into along...

766
00:41:29,536 --> 00:41:31,574
hot beauty bath now and...

767
00:41:31,606 --> 00:41:35,021
try to erase the stink
of a 5-year marriage.

768
00:41:35,045 --> 00:41:37,961
Someone at such a tender age
as you, Taffy...

769
00:41:37,984 --> 00:41:39,862
might find it
difficult to understand...

770
00:41:39,887 --> 00:41:44,704
what a long, hard, painful
decision this was on my part.

771
00:41:44,729 --> 00:41:48,441
I'm a free woman now, and my
life is just ready to begin.

772
00:41:51,073 --> 00:41:55,149
Oh, Ernie, have another pretzel,
for Christ's sake.

773
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,025
Wait till you meet
my little Gator.

774
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:59,555
You two are gonna
fall right in love.

775
00:41:59,588 --> 00:42:03,801
My dear, I hope so.
Are you sure he's gay?

776
00:42:03,829 --> 00:42:05,833
Well, I just use common sense.

777
00:42:05,866 --> 00:42:10,215
I mean, if they're smart,
they're queer.

778
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,520
And if they're stupid,
they're straight.

779
00:42:13,547 --> 00:42:14,754
Rig ht, Ernie?

780
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,956
Are you sure you won't
have another pretzel?

781
00:42:16,985 --> 00:42:19,331
I'm sure, Miss thing.
I'm sure.

782
00:42:19,356 --> 00:42:21,337
Pretzels give you plaque.

783
00:42:22,629 --> 00:42:24,576
Hello, Aunt Ida.

784
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:26,740
Gator, what a coincidence.

785
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:29,753
There's somebody here
dying to meet you.

786
00:42:29,775 --> 00:42:32,986
Ernie, this is Gator.
Gator, this is Ernie.

787
00:42:33,013 --> 00:42:34,322
Hi, stud.

788
00:42:34,349 --> 00:42:36,627
Get him out of here.

789
00:42:36,653 --> 00:42:39,398
Gator Nelson,
you be polite to Ernie.

790
00:42:39,426 --> 00:42:41,429
He wants a date with you.

791
00:42:41,462 --> 00:42:43,272
Well, I don't want
a date with him.

792
00:42:43,298 --> 00:42:44,869
I came to say
good-bye, Aunt Ida.

793
00:42:44,901 --> 00:42:46,507
I'm moving to Detroit.

794
00:42:46,538 --> 00:42:47,711
What?!

795
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,812
I want to be near
the auto industry.

796
00:42:49,843 --> 00:42:51,118
I'm sick of hairdressing.

797
00:42:51,145 --> 00:42:53,491
And besides, Dawn had me fired.

798
00:42:53,517 --> 00:42:55,624
I can get you a job
in the bath, Maw.

799
00:42:55,654 --> 00:42:57,657
Look, fucker,
take a walk, all right?

800
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:01,801
Look, you better beat it before
I punch your fucking face...

801
00:43:01,831 --> 00:43:03,175
out that window.

802
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,874
No gay knocks for me, Ida.

803
00:43:04,903 --> 00:43:07,580
At best,
all you've got is trade.

804
00:43:07,608 --> 00:43:10,853
Oh, Gator, Ernie's your type.

805
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,384
Move back in with me...

806
00:43:12,417 --> 00:43:16,094
and we'll get you a job
as a female impersonator.

807
00:43:16,123 --> 00:43:19,368
His hands are too big, darling.

808
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:23,278
Bye, Gator. it was...
fab meeting you.

809
00:43:23,302 --> 00:43:26,285
Fuck you!
You're worse than my wife.

810
00:43:26,307 --> 00:43:27,845
You can't leave.

811
00:43:27,877 --> 00:43:29,687
Well, I am.

812
00:43:29,713 --> 00:43:33,960
Oh, Gator,
I'm sorry about Ernie.

813
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:36,402
I thought you'd be
cute together.

814
00:43:36,426 --> 00:43:39,306
Anybody's better
than Dawn Slavenport.

815
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:40,936
It'll be all right, Aunt Ida.

816
00:43:40,967 --> 00:43:42,743
I'm just sick of
everything here.

817
00:43:42,769 --> 00:43:44,682
I'm going to Detroit
and find happiness...

818
00:43:44,707 --> 00:43:46,688
within the auto industry.

819
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:49,421
No, Gator, no!
I'll die if you leave!

820
00:43:51,518 --> 00:43:53,522
All right, Aunt Ida.
Good-bye.

821
00:44:17,831 --> 00:44:18,969
What?

822
00:44:18,999 --> 00:44:20,274
Hi, brat. ls your mother home?

823
00:44:20,301 --> 00:44:22,840
I have a little
going-away present for her.

824
00:44:22,873 --> 00:44:24,377
Ah,you...

825
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:25,788
Hey, mother!

826
00:44:25,812 --> 00:44:28,225
There's a shit out here
to see you!

827
00:44:30,853 --> 00:44:32,664
What are you doing on my porch?

828
00:44:32,691 --> 00:44:34,502
I told you not to come
moping around here anymore.

829
00:44:34,528 --> 00:44:36,839
Dawn, don't have
so many hard feelings.

830
00:44:36,864 --> 00:44:38,937
I brought you a little present
to remember me by.

831
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:40,311
Yeah? What is it?

832
00:44:46,549 --> 00:44:48,757
Oh, God. This
neighborhood's hideous.

833
00:44:48,785 --> 00:44:52,132
I'm scared rats are gonna
come out and bite my new nylons.

834
00:44:52,157 --> 00:44:54,161
True, it's not Beverly Hills...

835
00:44:54,195 --> 00:44:56,700
but crime breeds
in these neighborhoods, Donna.

836
00:44:56,733 --> 00:44:58,715
It's really
an oh-so-perfect place...

837
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:00,581
for our crime model to live.

838
00:45:00,606 --> 00:45:02,086
I rather like it.

839
00:45:02,109 --> 00:45:04,682
I'm glad I didn't wear
one of my designer originals.

840
00:45:04,713 --> 00:45:07,492
The air is so sooty and damp,
our clothes will be ready...

841
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:09,226
for the Goodwill after this.

842
00:45:09,254 --> 00:45:10,735
Stop being so prissy, Donna.

843
00:45:10,758 --> 00:45:12,898
Excitement is not always clean.

844
00:45:12,927 --> 00:45:14,806
You must get used
to this lowlife...

845
00:45:14,831 --> 00:45:19,978
for here lies beauty.
Crime and beauty.

846
00:45:20,007 --> 00:45:22,853
Oh, here it is. How perfect.

847
00:45:23,981 --> 00:45:26,087
Hold on. I'll be right there.

848
00:45:29,423 --> 00:45:31,701
Hi. Come on in.

849
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:33,572
Good evening, Dawn.

850
00:45:38,439 --> 00:45:40,215
Did you have any trouble
finding the place?

851
00:45:40,242 --> 00:45:42,622
Your directions
were pinpoint perfect.

852
00:45:42,647 --> 00:45:45,254
And your street, well,
it's a street of charm.

853
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,424
Oh, thank you.

854
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:48,297
Lovely.

855
00:45:48,323 --> 00:45:50,771
And I bet you cleaned
just for us.

856
00:45:50,794 --> 00:45:52,537
Well, I did tidy up.

857
00:45:52,565 --> 00:45:54,169
Uh, what happened
to your eye?

858
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,978
Oh, that.
lam so embarrassed.

859
00:45:57,004 --> 00:46:01,319
I fell getting on the bus
and hit my eye on the fare box.

860
00:46:01,346 --> 00:46:03,828
Well, I felt like a damn fool.

861
00:46:03,851 --> 00:46:05,228
Oh, come on in.

862
00:46:05,252 --> 00:46:06,733
May I take a photo of it?

863
00:46:06,755 --> 00:46:08,566
Oh, certainly.

864
00:46:10,362 --> 00:46:12,401
Nice.

865
00:46:12,433 --> 00:46:14,414
I love having my picture taken.

866
00:46:14,436 --> 00:46:17,317
Oh, I'm sorry. Sit down.

867
00:46:17,342 --> 00:46:20,348
I'm so excited about you all
coming here for dinner.

868
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,723
Stunning arrangement.

869
00:46:21,748 --> 00:46:24,664
Oh, thank you.
You both look so nice.

870
00:46:24,687 --> 00:46:26,565
Oh, thank you.

871
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:30,666
I'd like you to meet
my daughter Taffy.

872
00:46:30,697 --> 00:46:33,043
Taffy, this is
Mr. and Mrs. Dasher.

873
00:46:33,068 --> 00:46:35,071
They're going to put mother
into show business!

874
00:46:35,105 --> 00:46:37,178
Is the circus in town?

875
00:46:37,209 --> 00:46:39,121
She's so funny.

876
00:46:39,145 --> 00:46:41,594
If you'll excuse me,
I'll go check on dinner.

877
00:46:41,617 --> 00:46:43,393
Help yourself to the chips.

878
00:46:47,126 --> 00:46:49,541
What's that camera for?

879
00:46:49,564 --> 00:46:51,043
To take pictures
of your mother.

880
00:46:51,066 --> 00:46:52,205
Her?

881
00:46:52,235 --> 00:46:54,808
We happen to think
she is quite beautiful.

882
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:57,755
You must be cockeyed, then.

883
00:46:57,779 --> 00:47:00,887
Hey, lady, have some chips?

884
00:47:02,354 --> 00:47:03,799
Really, I couldn't.

885
00:47:03,822 --> 00:47:06,270
Thanks, but, uh, no, thanks.

886
00:47:08,731 --> 00:47:11,212
Do you want your spaghetti
with or without cheese?

887
00:47:11,234 --> 00:47:15,083
I'll have two
chicken breasts, please.

888
00:47:15,108 --> 00:47:16,919
Well, uh, we're not
having that.

889
00:47:16,945 --> 00:47:18,927
We're having spaghetti.

890
00:47:18,949 --> 00:47:22,296
Oh, I couldn't
possibly eat spaghetti.

891
00:47:22,322 --> 00:47:24,268
Do I look Italian?

892
00:47:24,291 --> 00:47:26,968
We rarely eat
any form of noodle, Dawn...

893
00:47:26,997 --> 00:47:29,479
but I'll take a tiny portion
to be polite.

894
00:47:29,501 --> 00:47:31,276
With cheese, please.

895
00:47:31,303 --> 00:47:34,219
I'll have an extremely large
glass of ice water.

896
00:47:34,242 --> 00:47:37,123
I want mine
with lots of cheese.

897
00:47:37,147 --> 00:47:39,686
I'm afraid there's not
enough for you, Taffy.

898
00:47:39,718 --> 00:47:41,255
How about some toast?

899
00:47:41,287 --> 00:47:43,895
What do you mean,
there's not enough?

900
00:47:43,925 --> 00:47:46,772
You can feed
these two ham bones...

901
00:47:46,798 --> 00:47:49,474
and you can't feed
your own daughter?

902
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:54,012
I told you things were gonna
start changing around here.

903
00:47:54,044 --> 00:47:57,722
Taffy, don't make me lose
my temper in front of company.

904
00:48:00,187 --> 00:48:02,500
Now, there's not enough
food for you to eat.

905
00:48:02,526 --> 00:48:04,473
Perhaps if Mr. Dasher
leaves some on his plate...

906
00:48:04,495 --> 00:48:06,169
you may have first pick.

907
00:48:06,198 --> 00:48:08,111
But I cannot be running out
to the supermarket...

908
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,672
every minute just for you.

909
00:48:09,704 --> 00:48:12,414
If I can't have any, nobody can!

910
00:48:12,443 --> 00:48:13,980
You come out
of that kitchen!

911
00:48:14,012 --> 00:48:15,925
Give it to me! They can't
have it, and I want it!

912
00:48:15,949 --> 00:48:17,691
Put that food down,
you little brat!

913
00:48:17,718 --> 00:48:19,393
They can't have it,
and I want it!

914
00:48:19,422 --> 00:48:20,730
You horrible little brat!

915
00:48:20,757 --> 00:48:22,898
You lay off that food!
I'm paying for that food!

916
00:48:24,864 --> 00:48:26,641
Oh, my God!

917
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,718
Oh, my God,
I'm going to kill you!

918
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,881
Let me see--

919
00:48:32,911 --> 00:48:34,084
Face forward.

920
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,631
This is so exciting!

921
00:48:42,662 --> 00:48:44,769
Just think of all
the little horror stories...

922
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,712
that go on
in other peoples' lives.

923
00:48:46,736 --> 00:48:49,014
Your dinner party has been
a smashing success.

924
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,178
Oh, I'm so sorry...

925
00:48:50,208 --> 00:48:51,450
you had to be
a witness to this.

926
00:48:51,478 --> 00:48:52,617
I didn't want to tell you...

927
00:48:52,647 --> 00:48:54,719
but my daughter's retarded.

928
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:57,324
A child psychologist told me
to beat her unmercifully...

929
00:48:57,356 --> 00:48:58,596
whenever she acted up.

930
00:48:58,624 --> 00:49:00,503
But it's never
gone this far before.

931
00:49:00,528 --> 00:49:02,201
I hope she's not dead!

932
00:49:02,229 --> 00:49:03,869
Oh, these photographs
will be stunning.

933
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,039
How about a few more
quickie shots...

934
00:49:05,068 --> 00:49:06,206
if you don't mind?

935
00:49:06,236 --> 00:49:07,410
Oh, anything for you, Donald.

936
00:49:07,439 --> 00:49:09,886
Oh, OK, uh...look rough!

937
00:49:11,446 --> 00:49:12,824
Look happy.

938
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:14,887
I love those flashbulbs!

939
00:49:14,919 --> 00:49:16,332
Look horrified
at what you've done...

940
00:49:16,355 --> 00:49:18,393
to your daughter.

941
00:49:18,425 --> 00:49:20,498
Oh, look like you've
just won a prize.

942
00:49:31,147 --> 00:49:33,186
Dawn, you son of a bitch!

943
00:49:33,218 --> 00:49:34,926
You're the one
who did it!

944
00:49:34,954 --> 00:49:37,938
You! You drove Gator away!

945
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,098
My God.

946
00:49:39,127 --> 00:49:40,266
Incredible!

947
00:49:40,297 --> 00:49:42,278
Ida Nelson, you get
out of my house!

948
00:49:42,301 --> 00:49:44,110
You made Gator leave!

949
00:49:44,136 --> 00:49:47,518
I got something for
your face, motherfucker!

950
00:49:53,086 --> 00:49:54,930
Acid! Acid!

951
00:49:54,955 --> 00:49:56,561
It's eating her face!

952
00:49:56,592 --> 00:49:57,731
Move, Donna!

953
00:49:57,761 --> 00:49:59,605
These will be the most
exquisite shots yet!

954
00:49:59,631 --> 00:50:02,410
Hold still while I focus.
Move your hand.

955
00:50:02,436 --> 00:50:03,744
Help me.

956
00:50:03,771 --> 00:50:05,217
Operation Excitement...

957
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,381
is off to a flying start!

958
00:50:07,411 --> 00:50:10,691
Just one more shot, Dawn.
You are beautiful.

959
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:14,293
Thank you, Mr. Dasher.

960
00:50:28,247 --> 00:50:29,421
Come on.

961
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:32,626
These visiting hours stink.

962
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:34,534
So, what you're saying,
doctor...

963
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:36,038
is that even though
there's no hope...

964
00:50:36,061 --> 00:50:37,406
for the scar tissue
to develop...

965
00:50:37,431 --> 00:50:40,038
makeup in itself
would not be painful...

966
00:50:40,068 --> 00:50:41,207
to the patient.

967
00:50:41,236 --> 00:50:42,842
Well, no, I suppose not.

968
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,353
But I find it most peculiar...

969
00:50:44,376 --> 00:50:45,947
you would even discuss makeup.

970
00:50:45,978 --> 00:50:48,961
What she needs is
a good plastic surgeon.

971
00:50:48,983 --> 00:50:50,931
Utter nonsense, doctor.

972
00:50:50,954 --> 00:50:52,491
With proper makeup treatments...

973
00:50:52,523 --> 00:50:54,436
her scars will be
mere beauty marks.

974
00:50:54,461 --> 00:50:56,635
The medical profession
has always shown...

975
00:50:56,664 --> 00:50:59,580
its extreme ignorance
in the beauty field.

976
00:50:59,603 --> 00:51:00,877
What you don't realize,
doctor...

977
00:51:00,904 --> 00:51:02,385
and really, how could you...

978
00:51:02,408 --> 00:51:04,980
is that Miss Davenport
will now be more beautiful...

979
00:51:05,011 --> 00:51:07,220
than if she had had
a million-dollar face-lift.

980
00:51:07,249 --> 00:51:08,923
What I find most distasteful...

981
00:51:08,952 --> 00:51:10,991
is the fact you've chosen
to bring a camera.

982
00:51:11,022 --> 00:51:13,300
Her face has been
hideously disfigured.

983
00:51:13,327 --> 00:51:15,832
Certainly this is
no time for photographs.

984
00:51:15,865 --> 00:51:18,780
Why not let us worry
about proper timing?

985
00:51:18,803 --> 00:51:21,342
Yes, why don't you
mind your own business?

986
00:51:21,374 --> 00:51:22,854
In all of my years...

987
00:51:22,877 --> 00:51:24,255
in the medical profession...

988
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:28,196
never have I encountered
such a morally bankrupt...

989
00:51:28,219 --> 00:51:29,358
97°11!) of people.

990
00:51:29,388 --> 00:51:31,768
Why, not only are you
selfish and vicious...

991
00:51:31,793 --> 00:51:33,273
but you have no feeling...

992
00:51:33,295 --> 00:51:35,777
for the cares
of your loved one.

993
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,111
And my bill will
reflect your attitude...

994
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:39,310
in this hospital.

995
00:51:39,339 --> 00:51:40,478
Gorgeous!

996
00:51:40,508 --> 00:51:41,680
Why, you--.

997
00:51:41,709 --> 00:51:45,490
Watch it, doc.
I sue and bruise easily.

998
00:51:46,718 --> 00:51:49,860
Miss Davenport
is ready for her guests.

999
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:54,103
See you
in malpractice court.

1000
00:51:54,131 --> 00:51:56,273
Get the presents.

1001
00:51:58,272 --> 00:52:00,447
Dawn, your friends are here.

1002
00:52:00,477 --> 00:52:02,856
Oh, hello, everyone.

1003
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,418
Hello, Miss Beautiful.

1004
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:05,896
We're all here
for the unveiling.

1005
00:52:05,919 --> 00:52:07,524
It's like a holiday for us.

1006
00:52:07,555 --> 00:52:10,401
This is so exciting.
Let's all say hi.

1007
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:12,500
Hi, Dawn.
It's me, Chicklette.

1008
00:52:12,531 --> 00:52:14,375
I can't wait
to see your new face.

1009
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,937
I hear it's stunning.

1010
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:18,452
It's Concetta, Dawn.
I'm so jealous.

1011
00:52:18,474 --> 00:52:20,956
Everybody tells me
you're the prettiest now.

1012
00:52:20,979 --> 00:52:23,257
Dribbles here. I hope
that fart of a doctor...

1013
00:52:23,283 --> 00:52:24,763
hasn't been giving you
any trouble.

1014
00:52:24,785 --> 00:52:26,266
It's Wink. I can't wait...

1015
00:52:26,289 --> 00:52:27,529
to do your hair, doll.

1016
00:52:27,557 --> 00:52:30,541
Oh, thank you, honey.
Thanks to everyone.

1017
00:52:30,563 --> 00:52:32,441
It's Butter, baby.
You'll be a goddess...

1018
00:52:32,466 --> 00:52:34,709
with this new face,
a goddess of order...

1019
00:52:34,736 --> 00:52:37,743
to protect all
your children in crime.

1020
00:52:37,775 --> 00:52:40,417
I want to see it. Nurse! Nurse!

1021
00:52:40,446 --> 00:52:41,983
Remove my bandages.

1022
00:52:42,016 --> 00:52:43,655
She asked me to remind you...

1023
00:52:43,685 --> 00:52:46,224
that she is, of course,
without makeup.

1024
00:52:46,257 --> 00:52:47,395
Oh, that's all right.

1025
00:52:47,425 --> 00:52:48,996
We understand, Dawn.

1026
00:52:49,028 --> 00:52:51,168
Don't worry about makeup.

1027
00:52:51,197 --> 00:52:53,339
Ooh, slowly, nurse. Slowly.

1028
00:52:53,369 --> 00:52:55,441
I want perfect focus.

1029
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:56,850
I can smell flesh.

1030
00:52:56,875 --> 00:52:58,982
God, I could faint,
I'm so excited.

1031
00:52:59,012 --> 00:53:00,959
It's just like
an art opening.

1032
00:53:00,982 --> 00:53:03,123
Christ, I wish
it'd happen to me.

1033
00:53:03,153 --> 00:53:05,795
Just think of how it
would look with my hair.

1034
00:53:05,824 --> 00:53:07,133
I'm getting a hard-on.

1035
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,072
Beauty always
gives me a hard-on.

1036
00:53:09,096 --> 00:53:10,839
Aim it the other way, then,
Wink.

1037
00:53:10,866 --> 00:53:12,744
You know how
I detest organs.

1038
00:53:12,769 --> 00:53:14,375
Beauty has
absolutely nothing...

1039
00:53:14,406 --> 00:53:15,885
to do with that word...

1040
00:53:15,908 --> 00:53:17,047
that thing you have there...

1041
00:53:17,077 --> 00:53:18,888
hanging like
an obscene pickle.

1042
00:53:18,914 --> 00:53:20,895
Spare me your anatomy.

1043
00:53:22,954 --> 00:53:25,493
There it is.

1044
00:53:25,525 --> 00:53:26,937
One hell of a rotten face.

1045
00:53:26,961 --> 00:53:29,273
Ooh...beautiful.

1046
00:53:30,901 --> 00:53:33,178
It's beautiful.
It's beautiful.

1047
00:53:35,977 --> 00:53:38,219
Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous!

1048
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:39,489
Makes the Mona Lisa...

1049
00:53:39,517 --> 00:53:41,019
look like a number painting.

1050
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:43,535
Acid does
what Eterna 27 cannot.

1051
00:53:43,557 --> 00:53:44,695
I'll say.

1052
00:53:44,725 --> 00:53:47,265
Your face,
for the world to see.

1053
00:53:47,297 --> 00:53:49,904
Breathtakingly beautiful.

1054
00:53:49,934 --> 00:53:51,073
Give her a mirror.

1055
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:52,550
Let her see the miracle.

1056
00:53:52,573 --> 00:53:54,018
Beauty, beauty, look at you.

1057
00:53:54,042 --> 00:53:56,115
I wish to God I had it, too.

1058
00:54:03,058 --> 00:54:04,334
Pretty pretty?

1059
00:54:08,401 --> 00:54:09,937
Look what we've bought you.

1060
00:54:12,442 --> 00:54:16,291
Oh, it's--Donald,
it's beautiful!

1061
00:54:16,315 --> 00:54:20,494
And look at all this makeup
we have for you.

1062
00:54:20,522 --> 00:54:22,126
You're so stunning...

1063
00:54:22,157 --> 00:54:24,470
I could cw
in the face of beauty.

1064
00:54:24,496 --> 00:54:26,100
You really like it?

1065
00:54:26,131 --> 00:54:28,044
Oh, yes.

1066
00:54:29,104 --> 00:54:32,110
I guess I kind of do, too.

1067
00:54:32,142 --> 00:54:35,057
Would you put
my makeup on for me?

1068
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,961
Oh, I'd love to, Dawn.

1069
00:54:37,985 --> 00:54:40,798
Nothing is too good
for our crime model.

1070
00:54:40,824 --> 00:54:43,238
Oh, thank you, Donald.

1071
00:54:47,135 --> 00:54:48,275
Surprise!

1072
00:54:48,304 --> 00:54:51,515
How do you like it, Dawn?

1073
00:54:51,543 --> 00:54:55,221
Oh! Oh, Donna,
it's beautiful!

1074
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,628
All the time you
were in the hospital...

1075
00:54:56,652 --> 00:54:57,893
recovering, we were busy...

1076
00:54:57,921 --> 00:55:00,529
busy trying
to make you happy.

1077
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:03,667
Here's $100, too.

1078
00:55:03,697 --> 00:55:06,077
And here's something else
for you to treasure.

1079
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:08,607
Oh! What is it?

1080
00:55:12,112 --> 00:55:13,957
Oh! A portrait!

1081
00:55:13,982 --> 00:55:16,464
You are both so good to me!

1082
00:55:16,487 --> 00:55:17,728
Ever since I met you...

1083
00:55:17,756 --> 00:55:20,568
my life's been like a vacation!

1084
00:55:20,594 --> 00:55:23,873
Look! A little stage!

1085
00:55:23,899 --> 00:55:27,110
Specially built,
Dawn, all for you.

1086
00:55:27,138 --> 00:55:28,676
All for the model of the year.

1087
00:55:28,708 --> 00:55:30,188
We've been hoping
for a rather insane...

1088
00:55:30,212 --> 00:55:31,350
camera session.

1089
00:55:31,379 --> 00:55:32,518
Come on. I'm ready.

1090
00:55:32,548 --> 00:55:34,187
I'm just in the mood...

1091
00:55:34,219 --> 00:55:35,960
for a red-hot camera session!

1092
00:55:35,987 --> 00:55:38,162
Slowly, Dawn, slowly.
You'll give me a heart attack.

1093
00:55:38,191 --> 00:55:40,172
Let me give you
some medicine.

1094
00:55:40,195 --> 00:55:42,302
What kind, Donald?

1095
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:44,211
Is it a beauty treatment?

1096
00:55:44,236 --> 00:55:45,944
Yes, Dawn, exactly.

1097
00:55:45,972 --> 00:55:48,284
It's eyeliner--
liquid eyeliner.

1098
00:55:48,309 --> 00:55:49,755
We cooked it down this morning.

1099
00:55:49,778 --> 00:55:51,918
It won't hurt. Nothing hurts.

1100
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:53,087
Have you ever mainlined?

1101
00:55:53,117 --> 00:55:54,427
No, but I will.

1102
00:55:54,454 --> 00:55:55,661
Keep taking those pictures...

1103
00:55:55,688 --> 00:55:56,929
and I'll do it.

1104
00:55:56,957 --> 00:56:01,033
Come on! Shoot me!

1105
00:56:01,064 --> 00:56:02,340
Feel it in your blood?

1106
00:56:02,368 --> 00:56:05,943
Caressing your corpuscles,
the wonders of liquid eyeliner.

1107
00:56:05,973 --> 00:56:09,514
Say it! Say, "Liquid eyeliner!"

1108
00:56:09,546 --> 00:56:12,495
Liquid eyeliner!

1109
00:56:12,518 --> 00:56:15,434
Model! Model!

1110
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,339
Give us something twisted.

1111
00:56:22,369 --> 00:56:24,043
Give us something warm.

1112
00:56:27,278 --> 00:56:29,190
I'm glad I met you!

1113
00:56:29,214 --> 00:56:31,058
I love crime, too...

1114
00:56:31,084 --> 00:56:34,534
especially the excitement
of getting away with it!

1115
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:36,539
These photos will be art!

1116
00:56:36,561 --> 00:56:38,200
Hard-core art.

1117
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:41,472
You ain't seen nothing yet.

1118
00:56:41,502 --> 00:56:43,541
I'll model for eternity for you.

1119
00:56:43,573 --> 00:56:45,713
Just let me hear
the click of that camera.

1120
00:56:47,947 --> 00:56:50,759
Just think of it,
house robbing, new gowns...

1121
00:56:50,785 --> 00:56:53,461
murder, scars, fingerprints...

1122
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:55,095
lashes!

1123
00:56:57,464 --> 00:56:58,808
You're missing the best part.

1124
00:56:58,833 --> 00:56:59,972
Wake up.

1125
00:57:00,002 --> 00:57:02,382
She hasn't received
all of her gifts, yet.

1126
00:57:02,406 --> 00:57:05,219
Beauty, eyeliner--

1127
00:57:05,245 --> 00:57:08,125
Oh, forgive me, Donald.

1128
00:57:08,149 --> 00:57:10,096
It was really
just too much for me.

1129
00:57:10,119 --> 00:57:11,259
What presents?

1130
00:57:11,288 --> 00:57:12,461
Get me another present!

1131
00:57:12,491 --> 00:57:13,629
Over here.

1132
00:57:13,658 --> 00:57:15,606
Here's your
biggest surprise yet.

1133
00:57:15,629 --> 00:57:17,406
Open it, for God sakes.
Open it.

1134
00:57:17,433 --> 00:57:21,407
Oh, it's as big as a house.

1135
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,218
Oh, my Christ! It's her!

1136
00:57:24,245 --> 00:57:26,020
Freshly kidnapped
for your amusement.

1137
00:57:26,047 --> 00:57:27,323
With no ransom, of course.

1138
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:28,489
She's so beautiful...

1139
00:57:28,519 --> 00:57:30,363
we figured you'd
want to keep her here caged...

1140
00:57:30,388 --> 00:57:31,595
like a rare bird.

1141
00:57:31,624 --> 00:57:32,763
Beautiful?!

1142
00:57:32,793 --> 00:57:35,969
You mean she has to live
here in my own home?

1143
00:57:35,998 --> 00:57:37,308
Only for a temporary period...

1144
00:57:37,334 --> 00:57:38,813
until we've gotten
all the photos we need...

1145
00:57:38,836 --> 00:57:40,181
for our experiment.

1146
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:42,210
But she disfigured me.

1147
00:57:42,243 --> 00:57:44,383
Think about it, Dawn.
She did you a favor...

1148
00:57:44,413 --> 00:57:47,294
and now you can
return this favor.

1149
00:57:47,318 --> 00:57:50,699
Cut off the hand
that threw the acid.

1150
00:57:50,723 --> 00:57:54,174
Whatever you say, Donald.
I had enough...

1151
00:57:54,198 --> 00:57:57,773
and I'm going to chop off
your scrawny little paw.

1152
00:57:57,803 --> 00:58:00,513
Hold it! Act--Look excited.

1153
00:58:00,541 --> 00:58:01,714
Action!

1154
00:58:05,684 --> 00:58:08,565
How was that
for a beauty photo...

1155
00:58:08,589 --> 00:58:10,764
Mr. Donald Dasher?

1156
00:58:10,793 --> 00:58:13,104
Get those cameras rolling!

1157
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,810
What's going on here?

1158
00:58:19,841 --> 00:58:22,153
Why--why, hello, Taffy.

1159
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,454
Did you miss mommy?

1160
00:58:23,481 --> 00:58:24,620
I'm home from the hospital.

1161
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:25,789
I'm all right.

1162
00:58:25,819 --> 00:58:27,663
I was hoping
the next time I'd see you...

1163
00:58:27,688 --> 00:58:29,897
would be at your funeral.

1164
00:58:29,926 --> 00:58:32,408
You sure look ugly.

1165
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:35,140
Not everyone seems
to feel that way.

1166
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:37,081
I think it's time
we were going, Donna.

1167
00:58:37,105 --> 00:58:40,555
It's been a long day,
and I'm feeling a bit damp.

1168
00:58:40,578 --> 00:58:41,751
Ditto, Donald.

1169
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:43,988
I really should be changing
my outfit anyway.

1170
00:58:44,017 --> 00:58:46,227
I've had it on
nearly 5 hours.

1171
00:58:46,255 --> 00:58:49,295
I want to thank you both
again for everything.

1172
00:58:49,327 --> 00:58:50,466
Our pleasure.

1173
00:58:50,496 --> 00:58:52,272
Would you care to join us
for dinner tonight?

1174
00:58:52,299 --> 00:58:53,608
Oh, I'd love to.

1175
00:58:53,634 --> 00:58:56,207
See you at 6:00.
Light dinner.

1176
00:58:56,239 --> 00:58:58,049
You may want to eat
before you come.

1177
00:58:58,075 --> 00:58:59,488
Am I invited?

1178
00:58:59,512 --> 00:59:02,256
"N." Good afternoon.

1179
00:59:03,252 --> 00:59:04,560
Thanks again.

1180
00:59:04,587 --> 00:59:06,830
Why didn't you send money
while you were away?

1181
00:59:06,857 --> 00:59:08,735
How was I supposed to eat?

1182
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,673
Come, come, Taffy.

1183
00:59:10,698 --> 00:59:14,113
It doesn't look like you starved
to death, does it?!

1184
00:59:14,136 --> 00:59:15,446
I want to leave here!

1185
00:59:15,473 --> 00:59:18,854
Well, good riddance
to bad rubbish.

1186
00:59:18,878 --> 00:59:20,723
What are you
trying to do to me?

1187
00:59:20,748 --> 00:59:23,254
Why are you always
with those people?

1188
00:59:23,287 --> 00:59:25,859
Why is she in a cage?

1189
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:28,396
I'm modeling for
the Dashers, that's all.

1190
00:59:28,429 --> 00:59:31,674
And Ida, well,
she's our new pet.

1191
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:34,309
You always wanted a pet,
Taffy.

1192
00:59:34,339 --> 00:59:36,081
I thought you'd be pleased.

1193
00:59:36,109 --> 00:59:39,150
You're trying to drive me
crazy, aren't you?

1194
00:59:39,181 --> 00:59:41,526
Well, I can't
stand it anymore.

1195
00:59:41,551 --> 00:59:45,696
Mother, please tell me
who is my real father?

1196
00:59:45,725 --> 00:59:47,832
I've told you never
to ask me about that.

1197
00:59:47,863 --> 00:59:49,367
If it was up to him,

1198
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,438
you'd be rotting
in some foster home.

1199
00:59:51,469 --> 00:59:53,382
I don't care!
I've got to know!

1200
00:59:53,407 --> 00:59:56,288
Tell me, mother,
who is my father?!

1201
00:59:56,312 --> 00:59:59,591
Oh, very well. Go see him.

1202
00:59:59,617 --> 01:00:01,292
See what it gets you.

1203
01:00:01,321 --> 01:00:04,361
He hates you, anyway.

1204
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:06,771
Where does he live,
and what's his name?

1205
01:00:06,796 --> 01:00:09,507
If you must know,
his name is Earl Peterson.

1206
01:00:09,535 --> 01:00:12,245
I haven't seen him
in a decade, Taffy.

1207
01:00:12,273 --> 01:00:15,050
I may have his address
stored on a piece of paper...

1208
01:00:15,077 --> 01:00:16,752
in an old shoe
in my bureau.

1209
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:19,262
I really can't remember.

1210
01:00:37,317 --> 01:00:40,596
Daddy! Daddy!

1211
01:00:40,622 --> 01:00:44,003
Daddy, it's me, Taffy!

1212
01:00:44,027 --> 01:00:45,303
Open the door!

1213
01:00:45,331 --> 01:00:48,006
I don't know
nobody named Taffy.

1214
01:00:48,034 --> 01:00:49,845
I'm busy right now.

1215
01:00:49,872 --> 01:00:52,114
Oh, please, let me in,
daddy!

1216
01:00:52,143 --> 01:00:54,182
Open the door!

1217
01:00:54,213 --> 01:00:56,626
Oh, fucking shut up!

1218
01:00:56,650 --> 01:00:59,428
All right, already.

1219
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:00,992
What do you want?

1220
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:05,443
Oh, daddy!
Daddy, it's me Taffy...

1221
01:01:05,466 --> 01:01:07,538
your long-lost little girl.

1222
01:01:07,569 --> 01:01:10,246
Hey, get off.
I ain't your daddy.

1223
01:01:10,275 --> 01:01:11,549
I ain't even married.

1224
01:01:11,576 --> 01:01:14,253
Oh, I know that,
but you're my daddy, all right.

1225
01:01:14,282 --> 01:01:15,693
My mother told me.

1226
01:01:15,716 --> 01:01:18,028
My mother is Dawn Davenport.

1227
01:01:18,054 --> 01:01:22,096
I don't know nobody
named Dawn Dawnenport.

1228
01:01:22,129 --> 01:01:25,374
Oh, but you must!
Mother told me.

1229
01:01:25,401 --> 01:01:28,475
Oh, please,
let me stay with you a while.

1230
01:01:28,506 --> 01:01:31,513
Yeah, you can stay here
for a while.

1231
01:01:31,545 --> 01:01:32,683
You want a drink?

1232
01:01:32,713 --> 01:01:35,595
No! You don't even
believe me, do you?

1233
01:01:35,619 --> 01:01:39,661
Yeah. Yeah, hey,
I'll be your sugar daddy.

1234
01:01:39,693 --> 01:01:41,731
How about that?

1235
01:01:41,762 --> 01:01:44,267
Oh, I'm feeling
a little drunk...

1236
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:45,871
so don't mind me.

1237
01:01:45,903 --> 01:01:47,976
Shitface, you're my father.

1238
01:01:48,007 --> 01:01:49,749
Doesn't that mean
anything to you?

1239
01:01:49,776 --> 01:01:51,780
Who'd you say
your mother was?

1240
01:01:51,814 --> 01:01:54,660
Dawn Davenport.
You know her.

1241
01:01:54,685 --> 01:01:56,428
What's she look like?

1242
01:01:56,456 --> 01:01:58,300
Fat, very fat.

1243
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:05,073
Yeah. Yeah, I maybe remember.

1244
01:02:05,104 --> 01:02:08,111
Oh, daddy, I knew you would.

1245
01:02:08,143 --> 01:02:09,781
Mother's been awful to me.

1246
01:02:09,811 --> 01:02:11,690
For years, I've suffered.

1247
01:02:11,715 --> 01:02:14,094
Please let me stay
with you for a while.

1248
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,498
I won't be any trouble.

1249
01:02:15,522 --> 01:02:17,161
I can--I'll help you clean...

1250
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:19,001
and we can go out together...

1251
01:02:19,028 --> 01:02:21,909
and maybe you could buy me
some regular clothes.

1252
01:02:21,933 --> 01:02:24,074
Can you fuck as good
as your mother?

1253
01:02:24,104 --> 01:02:27,986
Pig! You goddamn, slimy pig!

1254
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:31,324
Hey, little Taffy, do you
have breasts like Taffy?

1255
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:34,890
Fuck you!

1256
01:02:34,922 --> 01:02:38,839
Hey! You spilled my drink!

1257
01:02:38,862 --> 01:02:43,372
Daddy Earl's got a little
present for you here.

1258
01:02:51,552 --> 01:02:53,055
Oops, I'm sorry.

1259
01:02:53,089 --> 01:02:55,069
I've been drinking.

1260
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:16,631
Boom boom

1261
01:03:16,663 --> 01:03:18,644
Boom boom boom boom

1262
01:03:18,666 --> 01:03:20,170
D-i-g means "Look"

1263
01:03:20,202 --> 01:03:22,275
D-i-g means "Stare"

1264
01:03:22,306 --> 01:03:24,309
D-i-g means "See"

1265
01:03:24,343 --> 01:03:25,914
D-i-g means "Glare"

1266
01:03:25,945 --> 01:03:27,653
D-i-g means to use your eyes

1267
01:03:27,682 --> 01:03:29,925
So dig, dig, dig,
you crazy guys

1268
01:03:29,952 --> 01:03:32,024
Dig, dig, digarooni

1269
01:03:32,056 --> 01:03:33,901
Dig, dig, digarooni

1270
01:03:33,926 --> 01:03:35,804
Dig, dig, dig, digarooni

1271
01:03:35,829 --> 01:03:37,674
Dig, dig, dig, digarooni

1272
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:39,510
Dig, dig, dig, dig

1273
01:03:39,536 --> 01:03:41,381
Dig, you crazy guys

1274
01:03:41,406 --> 01:03:42,681
I like this one the best.

1275
01:03:42,709 --> 01:03:43,915
It has little Taffy in it.

1276
01:03:43,943 --> 01:03:45,185
Mm-hmm. I bet the police...

1277
01:03:45,213 --> 01:03:47,694
would love to get their hands
on these photos.

1278
01:03:50,923 --> 01:03:53,201
Come right on in, Dawn.

1279
01:04:01,675 --> 01:04:03,384
Evening!

1280
01:04:03,412 --> 01:04:04,914
Don't you look pretty.

1281
01:04:04,947 --> 01:04:06,428
Ooh, thank you.

1282
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:07,895
Subtle, isn't it?

1283
01:04:07,918 --> 01:04:10,094
Oh, it's beautiful.

1284
01:04:10,124 --> 01:04:12,605
And, God, my walk over here
was fabulous.

1285
01:04:12,627 --> 01:04:14,905
Everyone was staring
and gawking at me...

1286
01:04:14,931 --> 01:04:16,377
like I was a princess!

1287
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,177
Well, naturally.
Sit down, Dawn.

1288
01:04:18,204 --> 01:04:19,684
We all know
you're beautiful.

1289
01:04:19,707 --> 01:04:21,381
It just takes
the stupid little world...

1290
01:04:21,409 --> 01:04:23,288
a little longer
to catch on. Always has.

1291
01:04:23,313 --> 01:04:25,225
And don't forget
the influence...

1292
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:26,821
of that medicine
we gave you.

1293
01:04:26,852 --> 01:04:28,491
Eyeliner taken internally...

1294
01:04:28,522 --> 01:04:30,561
heightens one's
beauty awareness.

1295
01:04:30,592 --> 01:04:33,575
Oh, believe me,
I realize that now.

1296
01:04:33,597 --> 01:04:35,670
Why, I had never
felt complete...

1297
01:04:35,701 --> 01:04:37,978
until I experienced
an eyeliner rush.

1298
01:04:41,077 --> 01:04:42,887
We've been on the stuff
for months.

1299
01:04:42,914 --> 01:04:45,556
Doctors and other simpletons
may frown upon it...

1300
01:04:45,585 --> 01:04:48,762
but we beauty czars know
what is good for the blood.

1301
01:04:48,791 --> 01:04:50,396
Would you like
to shoot some more?

1302
01:04:50,427 --> 01:04:52,670
I had some orally earlier.

1303
01:04:52,698 --> 01:04:54,542
Oh, no, thanks, Donna.

1304
01:04:54,568 --> 01:04:56,550
I'm still up on it now.

1305
01:04:56,572 --> 01:04:59,555
Would you care
for an hors d'oeuvre, then?

1306
01:04:59,577 --> 01:05:01,819
Eat one.
They're really quite tasty.

1307
01:05:01,847 --> 01:05:05,196
Ooh, little mascara brushes!

1308
01:05:09,393 --> 01:05:10,668
Yummy, huh?

1309
01:05:13,801 --> 01:05:18,345
Yes, delicious,
but where's your camera?

1310
01:05:18,376 --> 01:05:19,788
Oh, it's here.
Don't worry about that.

1311
01:05:19,812 --> 01:05:21,191
We have lots of important...

1312
01:05:21,215 --> 01:05:22,558
business matters
to discuss tonight.

1313
01:05:22,583 --> 01:05:24,462
We've decided
that the time is right...

1314
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:26,661
for you to blast off
into show business.

1315
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:28,296
Oh, I'm ready, Mr. Dasher!

1316
01:05:32,668 --> 01:05:37,553
You little bitch, let me out
of this goddamn birdcage.

1317
01:05:37,577 --> 01:05:41,026
Little bitch?!
Is that all the thanks I get?

1318
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:42,825
I got you a hook, didn't I?

1319
01:05:42,852 --> 01:05:44,333
Mother will kill me
as it is.

1320
01:05:44,355 --> 01:05:47,668
Who cares about
your stinkin' mother?

1321
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:49,505
She stole my Gator away.

1322
01:05:49,531 --> 01:05:51,944
But she ain't gonna get me...

1323
01:05:51,968 --> 01:05:54,007
and I'll thank you
for this fucking hook...

1324
01:05:54,039 --> 01:05:57,080
after I rip
her eyes out with it.

1325
01:05:57,111 --> 01:05:58,420
Give me something to eat.

1326
01:05:58,447 --> 01:05:59,926
There's no food here.

1327
01:05:59,949 --> 01:06:02,592
Mother doesn't buy
food for me.

1328
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:03,793
You want an egg?

1329
01:06:03,822 --> 01:06:05,963
There might be a couple
of old eggs in the kitchen.

1330
01:06:05,993 --> 01:06:09,068
No, I don't want
no goddamn eggs!

1331
01:06:09,099 --> 01:06:12,173
I want meat and potatoes.

1332
01:06:12,204 --> 01:06:14,345
Please don't yell at me.

1333
01:06:14,375 --> 01:06:17,381
I've had a horrible
experience today.

1334
01:06:17,413 --> 01:06:19,360
I can't help
what's happened to you...

1335
01:06:19,383 --> 01:06:22,799
any more than I can help
what I did today.

1336
01:06:22,823 --> 01:06:24,667
Don't you think
I hate mother...

1337
01:06:24,692 --> 01:06:26,264
as much as you do?

1338
01:06:26,296 --> 01:06:28,800
Let me out of this cage,
little Taffy...

1339
01:06:28,833 --> 01:06:30,781
and I'll give you a cookie.

1340
01:06:30,803 --> 01:06:32,647
I can't let you out yet.

1341
01:06:32,673 --> 01:06:36,818
I promise I will,
but I need time to think.

1342
01:06:36,847 --> 01:06:39,387
I don't have anyplace to go.

1343
01:06:39,419 --> 01:06:41,297
Maybe I could go live...

1344
01:06:41,322 --> 01:06:43,201
with those
Hare Krishna people.

1345
01:06:43,226 --> 01:06:46,869
They're always nice to me
when I see them downtown.

1346
01:06:46,898 --> 01:06:49,403
Maybe--maybe
I could help them out.

1347
01:06:57,483 --> 01:07:01,434
I just want something nice
to happen in my life.

1348
01:07:01,457 --> 01:07:04,838
If only I could go live with
the Hare Krishna people.

1349
01:07:04,862 --> 01:07:06,605
They'd help me.

1350
01:07:06,633 --> 01:07:10,607
What are you doing here?!

1351
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:13,350
I thought you went to live
with your father.

1352
01:07:13,378 --> 01:07:16,020
He moved. He wasn't
at that address.

1353
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:19,033
Pity, pity.
Who ungagged this maggot?

1354
01:07:19,055 --> 01:07:20,534
You told me she was my pet.

1355
01:07:20,557 --> 01:07:22,061
I was just playing with her.

1356
01:07:22,094 --> 01:07:25,008
You let me out of here,
Dawn Pig-pork...

1357
01:07:25,032 --> 01:07:26,808
or you'll be sorry.

1358
01:07:26,835 --> 01:07:29,078
Now, now, now, Ida.

1359
01:07:29,106 --> 01:07:32,454
You're supposed to be
singing a sweet little song.

1360
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:34,050
Are you hungry?

1361
01:07:34,081 --> 01:07:36,563
The Dashers sent
some crackers for you.

1362
01:07:36,586 --> 01:07:38,624
Ida want a cracker?

1363
01:07:38,655 --> 01:07:39,964
Fuck off!

1364
01:07:39,991 --> 01:07:41,733
Who gave you that hook?

1365
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,332
Was it you, Taffy?

1366
01:07:43,364 --> 01:07:44,969
No! I swear!

1367
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,309
Oh, yes, it was...

1368
01:07:46,336 --> 01:07:49,751
you sneaking, conniving,
little abortion!

1369
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:51,050
She was in pain.

1370
01:07:51,078 --> 01:07:53,151
You're a pain, too, Taffy...

1371
01:07:53,182 --> 01:07:56,393
a pain in my big asshole.

1372
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:59,665
I'll see you fry
in the electric chair for this.

1373
01:07:59,692 --> 01:08:04,304
I'll personally see that you fry
in the goddamn chair for this.

1374
01:08:04,334 --> 01:08:07,146
I'll shut you up.

1375
01:08:07,173 --> 01:08:08,482
Where's that gag?!

1376
01:08:08,508 --> 01:08:10,955
Fucker! Pig fucker!

1377
01:08:10,978 --> 01:08:13,120
Was that a mating call?

1378
01:08:13,150 --> 01:08:16,190
Ouch! I'll shut
that big flytrap!

1379
01:08:16,222 --> 01:08:18,499
Hetero! Filthy hetero!
Stink shit!

1380
01:08:18,525 --> 01:08:21,532
Oh, you'll never
get out of here now!

1381
01:08:21,565 --> 01:08:24,707
And I won't clean
your cage for a week!

1382
01:08:24,736 --> 01:08:27,742
Ow! God damn it,
you broke my nail.

1383
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:29,154
There!

1384
01:08:29,178 --> 01:08:31,181
You're insane!

1385
01:08:31,215 --> 01:08:33,823
My own mother is insane.

1386
01:08:33,852 --> 01:08:35,992
And you stop
that fake blubbering...

1387
01:08:36,023 --> 01:08:37,935
and don't go getting
any crocodile tears...

1388
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,599
on my new furniture,
either.

1389
01:08:39,629 --> 01:08:42,135
Look at you. You're a freak.

1390
01:08:42,168 --> 01:08:45,014
Oh, God, what's happened
to your hair?

1391
01:08:45,039 --> 01:08:47,953
Haven't you ever heard
of style, Taffy?

1392
01:08:47,977 --> 01:08:51,518
I'm going to live with
the Hare Krishna people.

1393
01:08:51,550 --> 01:08:53,259
What did you say?

1394
01:08:53,287 --> 01:08:55,791
The Krishna's
all love, mother.

1395
01:08:55,824 --> 01:08:58,831
Oh, God, I would have
killed you at birth...

1396
01:08:58,863 --> 01:09:01,641
had I thought you would even
entertain such an idea.

1397
01:09:01,668 --> 01:09:04,150
Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna

1398
01:09:04,172 --> 01:09:05,846
Stop that bullshit!

1399
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:07,947
Where did you meet
those awful people?

1400
01:09:07,978 --> 01:09:09,982
Are they trying
to brainwash you?!

1401
01:09:10,017 --> 01:09:12,726
Can't you see how pretty
your mother is?

1402
01:09:12,754 --> 01:09:14,133
Don't you envy me?

1403
01:09:14,157 --> 01:09:16,195
Do you want to walk
around the street...

1404
01:09:16,227 --> 01:09:18,300
dressed in rags
the rest of your life...

1405
01:09:18,331 --> 01:09:19,867
selling stink sticks?!

1406
01:09:19,899 --> 01:09:23,043
Incense, mother. Incense.

1407
01:09:23,073 --> 01:09:24,609
Hare Rama

1408
01:09:24,641 --> 01:09:26,680
Stop those chants!

1409
01:09:26,712 --> 01:09:28,659
You're just trying
to get on my nerves now.

1410
01:09:28,682 --> 01:09:30,561
I would die of embarrassment...

1411
01:09:30,585 --> 01:09:34,502
if you ever dare link my name
with that pack of fools.

1412
01:09:34,526 --> 01:09:36,063
Think of my career.

1413
01:09:36,095 --> 01:09:38,407
Why, I'd sooner
you be a secretary.

1414
01:09:38,433 --> 01:09:40,641
Rama, Hare Rama

1415
01:09:40,669 --> 01:09:42,776
Oh! I'm warning you
right now, Taffy.

1416
01:09:42,807 --> 01:09:44,788
If I'm ever downtown...

1417
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:47,760
and see you dressed in one
of those ridiculous outfits...

1418
01:09:47,782 --> 01:09:50,060
bothering shoppers,
and dancing around...

1419
01:09:50,087 --> 01:09:51,590
like some sort of a fool...

1420
01:09:51,622 --> 01:09:55,698
I'll kill you,
and I mean business.

1421
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:58,110
You can't kill love, mother.

1422
01:09:58,134 --> 01:10:00,446
You can't kill Krishna...

1423
01:10:00,471 --> 01:10:03,182
because Krishna
is consciousness.

1424
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:04,814
- Hare Rama
- Oh, God!

1425
01:10:04,845 --> 01:10:06,451
I'll show you consciousness...

1426
01:10:06,482 --> 01:10:08,191
while I knock you
unconscious.

1427
01:10:08,219 --> 01:10:11,828
Now, Taffy, I have
a very busy week ahead of me.

1428
01:10:11,858 --> 01:10:13,600
I have hours
of studying to do...

1429
01:10:13,627 --> 01:10:16,042
plus a lot of rehearsal
for my new nightclub act.

1430
01:10:16,066 --> 01:10:18,047
If you feel
you must stay here...

1431
01:10:18,069 --> 01:10:20,073
I ask you
to constantly remember...

1432
01:10:20,106 --> 01:10:23,055
that you are
in the presence of a star.

1433
01:10:23,078 --> 01:10:24,319
Ohm!

1434
01:10:24,347 --> 01:10:27,057
Jesus Christ almighty!

1435
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:34,566
Step right up,
ladies and gentlemen.

1436
01:10:34,597 --> 01:10:35,736
Step right this way.

1437
01:10:35,766 --> 01:10:37,338
Free makeup in the lobby.

1438
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:39,942
See the most
beautiful woman alive.

1439
01:10:39,973 --> 01:10:42,285
Just wait till
you see the show.

1440
01:10:42,311 --> 01:10:44,657
You'll get
the surprise of your lives.

1441
01:10:44,682 --> 01:10:45,820
Step right up...

1442
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:47,160
Step right this way.

1443
01:10:47,187 --> 01:10:49,328
This is a show you
will not believe.

1444
01:10:49,357 --> 01:10:52,169
You should see the crowds
out there, Dawn.

1445
01:10:52,196 --> 01:10:53,335
It's packed.

1446
01:10:53,364 --> 01:10:55,902
God, you'll be
a household word overnight.

1447
01:10:55,935 --> 01:10:58,110
Oh, just think--
flashbulbs popping...

1448
01:10:58,139 --> 01:10:59,278
your picture in the paper...

1449
01:10:59,308 --> 01:11:00,447
writers in the audience...

1450
01:11:00,477 --> 01:11:02,219
artists just begging
to paint you...

1451
01:11:02,246 --> 01:11:03,989
just like you
were president.

1452
01:11:04,016 --> 01:11:06,055
Tonight she'll be
even more important...

1453
01:11:06,086 --> 01:11:07,259
than the president.

1454
01:11:07,288 --> 01:11:09,361
Oh, I just can't wait
to get out there.

1455
01:11:09,392 --> 01:11:12,307
I can feel exhibitionism
throbbing in my veins.

1456
01:11:12,331 --> 01:11:14,437
Where have you been, Taffy?

1457
01:11:14,467 --> 01:11:16,380
I thought
you left me here to rot.

1458
01:11:16,404 --> 01:11:17,543
I'm living with...

1459
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:19,554
the Hare Krishna people
now, Ida.

1460
01:11:19,576 --> 01:11:22,025
I've finally found
my inner peace.

1461
01:11:22,048 --> 01:11:23,959
I'm going
to set you free now.

1462
01:11:23,985 --> 01:11:27,230
Oh, thank Christ, Taffy.

1463
01:11:27,257 --> 01:11:28,862
Quick, honey, let me out.

1464
01:11:28,893 --> 01:11:31,000
My ass hurts
from this stool.

1465
01:11:31,030 --> 01:11:32,738
If you let me out right away...

1466
01:11:32,766 --> 01:11:35,908
I'll buy $5.00 worth
of incense from you.

1467
01:11:35,938 --> 01:11:38,581
Ida, all this time
you've been in this cage...

1468
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:39,988
you could have been
meditating.

1469
01:11:40,013 --> 01:11:41,152
Why, you're practically...

1470
01:11:41,181 --> 01:11:42,786
in the lotus position
right now.

1471
01:11:42,817 --> 01:11:44,525
Come on.

1472
01:11:44,554 --> 01:11:45,693
Thank you.

1473
01:11:45,722 --> 01:11:47,498
There.

1474
01:11:47,525 --> 01:11:50,099
Oh, thank you.

1475
01:11:50,131 --> 01:11:53,671
Thank you, Taffy.

1476
01:11:53,703 --> 01:11:56,242
I want you to go
immediately to the police.

1477
01:11:56,274 --> 01:11:58,313
Tell them that my mother,

1478
01:11:58,345 --> 01:12:00,553
the enemy of spirituality,

1479
01:12:00,582 --> 01:12:02,222
is at Superstar Nightclub,

1480
01:12:02,252 --> 01:12:04,631
and I want her arrested tonight.

1481
01:12:04,655 --> 01:12:06,830
Tell the police everything.

1482
01:12:06,859 --> 01:12:10,036
I'll go right to the
police station, Miss Taffy...

1483
01:12:10,066 --> 01:12:12,570
and I'll report it all...

1484
01:12:12,603 --> 01:12:15,746
and remember my offer.
It still stands.

1485
01:12:15,775 --> 01:12:18,519
If you get tired
of being a Hare Krishner...

1486
01:12:18,547 --> 01:12:21,496
you come live with me
and be a lesbian.

1487
01:12:21,518 --> 01:12:22,725
Fly away!

1488
01:12:22,754 --> 01:12:25,362
Fly away quickly
like a little bird.

1489
01:12:25,392 --> 01:12:27,101
Quickly to the police.

1490
01:12:27,129 --> 01:12:29,610
Tell them his divine grace,

1491
01:12:29,633 --> 01:12:33,675
Zabatividanti Swami Puupupata
has spoken.

1492
01:12:33,706 --> 01:12:35,654
Thank you, Taffy. Thank you.

1493
01:12:35,677 --> 01:12:37,385
I will. I will.

1494
01:12:46,329 --> 01:12:50,678
You look violent.

1495
01:12:50,703 --> 01:12:54,415
Oh, Richard Speck,
guide me through this night.

1496
01:12:54,443 --> 01:12:57,892
Help me to be brave
on this night of glamour.

1497
01:13:12,008 --> 01:13:13,749
Hare Krishna, mother.

1498
01:13:13,776 --> 01:13:16,783
Oh, you've finally
done it, haven't you?

1499
01:13:16,816 --> 01:13:19,765
Embarrassed me
on my night of fame!

1500
01:13:19,787 --> 01:13:21,996
No reporter saw you,
did they?

1501
01:13:22,025 --> 01:13:24,633
Ooh, look at you.
I could vomit.

1502
01:13:24,663 --> 01:13:27,305
I thought I'd come
and see you one last time...

1503
01:13:27,334 --> 01:13:29,441
before your karma
caught up with you.

1504
01:13:29,472 --> 01:13:31,578
Mother, it's not too late.

1505
01:13:31,608 --> 01:13:34,216
Come to the temple with me.

1506
01:13:34,246 --> 01:13:36,592
The exact opposite of beauty.

1507
01:13:36,617 --> 01:13:38,791
Remember Alice Crimin?

1508
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:41,633
All of you, can't you
see what you're doing?

1509
01:13:41,659 --> 01:13:45,576
Worshipping the flesh
and ignoring the spiritual.

1510
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,547
Oh, if only
you could see the light.

1511
01:13:47,569 --> 01:13:49,778
Discovering my consciousness...

1512
01:13:49,807 --> 01:13:53,087
was like finding a million
dollars in the street.

1513
01:13:53,113 --> 01:13:55,390
I'm glowing with happiness.

1514
01:13:55,416 --> 01:13:56,988
Well, glow on, then, Taffy...

1515
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:59,865
because the sight of you
makes my flesh crawl.

1516
01:13:59,891 --> 01:14:02,464
I'm sick of listening
to you babble commandments...

1517
01:14:02,495 --> 01:14:03,634
and spout gibberish.

1518
01:14:03,664 --> 01:14:05,805
It's turning my stomach.
Do you hear?!

1519
01:14:05,835 --> 01:14:07,577
And in just a few seconds...

1520
01:14:07,604 --> 01:14:10,417
I'm going to put you
out of your happiness.

1521
01:14:10,443 --> 01:14:13,449
Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna

1522
01:14:13,482 --> 01:14:15,463
Shut up! Shut up!

1523
01:14:15,485 --> 01:14:18,196
Hare Hare

1524
01:14:26,872 --> 01:14:29,411
She's finally dead!

1525
01:14:29,443 --> 01:14:33,053
Oh, I think I'm
ready to go on now.

1526
01:14:44,803 --> 01:14:46,341
Attention!

1527
01:14:46,373 --> 01:14:50,847
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to introduce

1528
01:14:50,881 --> 01:14:52,884
the most beautiful woman
in the world,

1529
01:14:52,918 --> 01:14:55,560
the fabulous Dawn Davenport.

1530
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:29,562
Thank you. I love you.
Thank you.

1531
01:17:29,592 --> 01:17:32,700
Thank you from the bottom
of my black little heart.

1532
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:35,408
You came here
for some excitement tonight...

1533
01:17:35,436 --> 01:17:39,546
and that's just
what you're going to get.

1534
01:17:39,577 --> 01:17:41,421
Take a good look at me...

1535
01:17:41,446 --> 01:17:43,485
because I'm going to be
on the front...

1536
01:17:43,517 --> 01:17:46,363
of every newspaper
in this country tomorrow.

1537
01:17:46,389 --> 01:17:49,395
You're looking
at crime personified...

1538
01:17:49,427 --> 01:17:51,773
and don't you forget it.

1539
01:17:51,798 --> 01:17:55,613
I framed Leslie Bacon.

1540
01:17:55,638 --> 01:18:00,590
I called the heroin hot line
on Abbie Hoffman.

1541
01:18:00,613 --> 01:18:05,794
I bought the gun that Bremmer
used to shoot Wallace.

1542
01:18:05,822 --> 01:18:09,899
I had an affair
with Juan Corona.

1543
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:13,675
I blew Richard Speck.

1544
01:18:13,703 --> 01:18:17,813
And I'm so fucking beautiful
I can't stand it myself.

1545
01:18:26,259 --> 01:18:29,640
Now, everybody, freeze.

1546
01:18:29,664 --> 01:18:31,577
Who wants to be famous?

1547
01:18:31,601 --> 01:18:34,049
Who wants to die for art?!

1548
01:18:34,072 --> 01:18:35,245
Idol

1549
01:19:21,622 --> 01:19:24,264
Freeze before I blow the
bleached blonde head off of you!

1550
01:19:24,294 --> 01:19:26,333
We're innocent. We surrender.

1551
01:19:26,365 --> 01:19:28,938
She went berserk.
She was on drugs.

1552
01:19:28,969 --> 01:19:30,347
Don't shoot us, please!

1553
01:19:30,372 --> 01:19:34,118
We're clean.
Please don't shoot me!

1554
01:19:53,245 --> 01:19:54,554
Oh, my God!

1555
01:20:03,963 --> 01:20:05,443
Come on out, Davenport!

1556
01:20:05,466 --> 01:20:07,640
We've got you!

1557
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:11,586
Can't get away, Davenport.
Come on.

1558
01:20:11,609 --> 01:20:13,454
We got you now.

1559
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:15,620
We've got you.

1560
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,059
We've got you this time.

1561
01:20:18,088 --> 01:20:21,094
There's no way out.

1562
01:20:21,127 --> 01:20:22,436
Come on out, Davenport.

1563
01:20:22,463 --> 01:20:23,738
You haven't got a chance.

1564
01:20:23,765 --> 01:20:25,177
We got you, Davenport.

1565
01:20:25,201 --> 01:20:28,673
Come on out.
We've got you, Davenport.

1566
01:20:28,706 --> 01:20:30,153
You haven't got a chance.

1567
01:20:30,176 --> 01:20:33,648
Come on out.
We've got you surrounded.

1568
01:20:33,682 --> 01:20:35,892
You go that way.
I'll go this way.

1569
01:21:12,217 --> 01:21:13,925
Don't move, Davenport.

1570
01:21:13,953 --> 01:21:15,092
Freeze, Davenport.

1571
01:21:15,122 --> 01:21:16,431
Put your hands
behind your back.

1572
01:21:16,457 --> 01:21:18,369
I didn't do one thing!

1573
01:21:18,394 --> 01:21:19,567
You're gonna get it
for this.

1574
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,113
Get off!

1575
01:21:29,713 --> 01:21:31,388
Pig.

1576
01:21:34,755 --> 01:21:36,498
Court is now in session.

1577
01:21:36,526 --> 01:21:38,063
Mr. Wilroy.

1578
01:21:38,095 --> 01:21:41,477
Thank you, Your Honor.

1579
01:21:41,501 --> 01:21:44,507
Your Honor,
defense counsel...

1580
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:46,214
ladies and gentlemen
of the jury...

1581
01:21:46,242 --> 01:21:48,246
the case we have before us...

1582
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:51,627
is one of the most savage
crimes ever perpetrated...

1583
01:21:51,652 --> 01:21:55,398
by one individual in the history
of the state of Maryland.

1584
01:21:55,425 --> 01:21:59,399
The evidence will prove
beyond a reasonable doubt...

1585
01:21:59,432 --> 01:22:04,044
that the defendant
Dawn Davenport is guilty...

1586
01:22:04,074 --> 01:22:07,923
of not only kidnapping,
but first-degree murder.

1587
01:22:07,948 --> 01:22:10,759
Her victims came
from all walks of life...

1588
01:22:10,785 --> 01:22:15,670
young people, an elderly woman,
police officers...

1589
01:22:15,694 --> 01:22:18,871
and even the defendant's
own daughter.

1590
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:22,043
It is a sordid
and sickening case...

1591
01:22:22,073 --> 01:22:25,079
that can end
in only one just verdict...

1592
01:22:25,111 --> 01:22:26,420
guilty!

1593
01:22:26,447 --> 01:22:28,155
I ask you
to show the defendant...

1594
01:22:28,183 --> 01:22:30,894
the same mercy
she showed her victims.

1595
01:22:30,922 --> 01:22:34,565
Sentence her to die
in the electric chair.

1596
01:22:34,594 --> 01:22:37,236
Let's go to the night
of April 22.

1597
01:22:37,266 --> 01:22:38,838
Do you remember that night?

1598
01:22:38,869 --> 01:22:40,644
Yes, I do.

1599
01:22:40,671 --> 01:22:43,677
I was at home
having some sherry...

1600
01:22:43,710 --> 01:22:45,214
and listening to records,

1601
01:22:45,246 --> 01:22:48,695
and Dawn Davenport
came to my door...

1602
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:51,066
and pulled a gun on me.

1603
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:53,072
That's a lie. I done nothing.

1604
01:22:53,094 --> 01:22:56,703
Order. Order in this courtroom.

1605
01:22:56,733 --> 01:22:58,442
It's the truth, pig-pork...

1606
01:22:58,470 --> 01:23:00,246
and you know it.

1607
01:23:00,272 --> 01:23:02,345
She forced me at gunpoint...

1608
01:23:02,376 --> 01:23:04,824
into her crummy little house...

1609
01:23:04,848 --> 01:23:07,524
stripped me of my clothes...

1610
01:23:07,552 --> 01:23:11,401
and made me exhibit myself
in front of her.

1611
01:23:11,426 --> 01:23:13,965
You liar! Liar!

1612
01:23:13,997 --> 01:23:16,946
She made me put on
a feather dress...

1613
01:23:16,969 --> 01:23:19,110
locked me in a birdcage...

1614
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:22,419
and cut off my arm with an ax.

1615
01:23:22,445 --> 01:23:23,754
I object, Your Honor...

1616
01:23:23,781 --> 01:23:25,990
on the grounds that this
witness is not competent...

1617
01:23:26,018 --> 01:23:27,795
and that she is senile.

1618
01:23:27,822 --> 01:23:29,460
Overruled.

1619
01:23:29,490 --> 01:23:32,997
I call to the stand
Donna Dasher.

1620
01:23:33,030 --> 01:23:34,841
She'll tell the truth.

1621
01:23:34,867 --> 01:23:36,006
Hi, Donna.

1622
01:23:36,036 --> 01:23:38,848
We know all about
excitement, don't we?

1623
01:23:38,874 --> 01:23:41,685
The press is all here,
and I'm looking real pretty...

1624
01:23:41,711 --> 01:23:42,851
but these 2 witches...

1625
01:23:42,881 --> 01:23:44,691
won't give me
my fashion accessories.

1626
01:23:46,822 --> 01:23:48,234
Order in the courtroom.

1627
01:23:48,257 --> 01:23:49,759
Now, Mrs. Dasher...

1628
01:23:49,793 --> 01:23:52,708
you understand you have
been granted total immunity...

1629
01:23:52,731 --> 01:23:54,006
for your testimony?

1630
01:23:54,034 --> 01:23:55,275
Yes. Thank you, Your Honor.

1631
01:23:55,303 --> 01:23:57,215
It is total immunity?

1632
01:23:57,239 --> 01:23:59,585
Yes, Mrs. Dasher. Total.

1633
01:23:59,610 --> 01:24:03,390
You became involved taking
pictures of the defendant.

1634
01:24:03,417 --> 01:24:05,160
Is that correct, Mrs. Dasher?

1635
01:24:05,187 --> 01:24:07,327
Yes. Fashion photographs.

1636
01:24:07,357 --> 01:24:08,929
Could you tell us a little...

1637
01:24:08,961 --> 01:24:11,340
about these
photography sessions?

1638
01:24:11,364 --> 01:24:12,777
Well, they never
really amounted...

1639
01:24:12,801 --> 01:24:14,246
to much, Mr. Wilroy.

1640
01:24:14,269 --> 01:24:15,408
We soon learned...

1641
01:24:15,438 --> 01:24:16,942
that Dawn's
modeling abilities...

1642
01:24:16,975 --> 01:24:18,750
were rather limited.

1643
01:24:18,777 --> 01:24:20,689
She would pose and
strut all the time...

1644
01:24:20,714 --> 01:24:22,992
as if she thought
we'd enjoy the sight...

1645
01:24:23,018 --> 01:24:25,227
of such sickening exhibitionism.

1646
01:24:25,256 --> 01:24:27,203
She even scarred
her own face...

1647
01:24:27,225 --> 01:24:28,797
in order to attract attention.

1648
01:24:28,829 --> 01:24:30,776
She would talk of
nothing but crime...

1649
01:24:30,798 --> 01:24:32,142
and criminal behavior...

1650
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:35,082
and she even seemed
to idolize Richard Speck.

1651
01:24:35,106 --> 01:24:37,213
Anything else, Mrs. Dasher?

1652
01:24:37,243 --> 01:24:38,381
One time, she--

1653
01:24:38,411 --> 01:24:40,017
Go on. Go on.

1654
01:24:40,048 --> 01:24:42,030
She used a needle
in front of me.

1655
01:24:42,052 --> 01:24:44,556
I was shocked silly
but said nothing...

1656
01:24:44,589 --> 01:24:46,365
hoping that maybe
she was diabetic...

1657
01:24:46,392 --> 01:24:47,531
and hadn't told me.

1658
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:48,699
Then, all by accident...

1659
01:24:48,729 --> 01:24:51,405
we discovered she kidnapped
the woman next-door.

1660
01:24:51,434 --> 01:24:52,607
You lying bitch!

1661
01:24:52,636 --> 01:24:54,379
You're the one that gave me
those beauty treatments!

1662
01:24:54,407 --> 01:24:56,251
You're the one
that kidnapped Ida...

1663
01:24:56,276 --> 01:24:58,485
you lying,
bleached-blonde bitch!

1664
01:24:58,514 --> 01:25:01,395
Liar! Liar!

1665
01:25:01,419 --> 01:25:04,300
Could you tell us about
the evening of May 8?

1666
01:25:04,324 --> 01:25:06,932
Yes. That is the night...

1667
01:25:06,962 --> 01:25:08,601
we went to what
Miss Davenport...

1668
01:25:08,631 --> 01:25:10,773
refers to as
her nightclub act.

1669
01:25:10,803 --> 01:25:12,407
We were backstage.

1670
01:25:12,438 --> 01:25:15,979
Dawn was wild-eyed
and pacing up and down...

1671
01:25:16,011 --> 01:25:18,084
ranting and raving
about her beauty...

1672
01:25:18,115 --> 01:25:21,064
when, in reality,
she looked quite hideous.

1673
01:25:21,087 --> 01:25:22,658
Her daughter Taffy came in...

1674
01:25:22,689 --> 01:25:25,901
and they had a big fight
over religious freedom.

1675
01:25:25,929 --> 01:25:28,206
Donna and I were terrified...

1676
01:25:28,232 --> 01:25:29,838
but stood by helplessly.

1677
01:25:29,869 --> 01:25:31,678
The fighting continued...

1678
01:25:31,704 --> 01:25:33,846
and Dawn strangled
her daughter to death...

1679
01:25:33,876 --> 01:25:35,413
right in front of us.

1680
01:25:37,850 --> 01:25:40,127
What happened then?

1681
01:25:40,153 --> 01:25:43,330
She ran on stage
to begin her so-called act...

1682
01:25:43,359 --> 01:25:44,736
a pitiful display...

1683
01:25:44,762 --> 01:25:47,574
based solely on
how disgusting she could be.

1684
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,208
She seemed to work
herself up into a frenzy...

1685
01:25:50,238 --> 01:25:51,718
shouting ridiculous claims...

1686
01:25:51,740 --> 01:25:53,049
of criminal conduct...

1687
01:25:53,076 --> 01:25:55,354
grimacing wildly
into the audience.

1688
01:25:55,380 --> 01:25:57,088
And then, before
we could realize it...

1689
01:25:57,116 --> 01:25:58,391
she pulled a gun...

1690
01:25:58,419 --> 01:26:00,127
and began shooting
into the crowd.

1691
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:02,159
I can't describe the horror.

1692
01:26:02,192 --> 01:26:05,232
It was nothing
but screams and panic.

1693
01:26:05,264 --> 01:26:08,509
I lived through hell
that night.

1694
01:26:08,536 --> 01:26:11,076
Your Honor, Mr. Wilroy,

1695
01:26:11,108 --> 01:26:12,782
ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

1696
01:26:12,811 --> 01:26:15,293
we have heard a lot of
witnesses condemn my client.

1697
01:26:15,315 --> 01:26:17,991
We have heard some
incredibly bizarre testimony...

1698
01:26:18,020 --> 01:26:21,697
and we have seen some
damaging physical evidence...

1699
01:26:21,725 --> 01:26:23,673
but my client is innocent...

1700
01:26:23,696 --> 01:26:26,235
innocent by
reason of insanity.

1701
01:26:26,267 --> 01:26:28,215
Listen to her testimony.

1702
01:26:28,238 --> 01:26:30,344
Listen to the whisperings
of a madwoman...

1703
01:26:30,374 --> 01:26:32,083
and decide for yourselves...

1704
01:26:32,112 --> 01:26:34,924
if she is not insane, who is?

1705
01:26:34,950 --> 01:26:37,056
I do not ask you
to forgive her.

1706
01:26:37,086 --> 01:26:39,329
I do not ask you
to set her free.

1707
01:26:39,357 --> 01:26:41,805
I ask you to have
the courage to help her.

1708
01:26:41,828 --> 01:26:43,137
Find her insane...

1709
01:26:43,164 --> 01:26:45,942
so that she can be put away
in a mental hospital...

1710
01:26:45,969 --> 01:26:48,474
for the rest
of her natural life.

1711
01:26:48,507 --> 01:26:51,319
Dawn, how did you
become acquainted...

1712
01:26:51,345 --> 01:26:53,349
with Donald and Donna Dasher?

1713
01:26:53,382 --> 01:26:55,363
I went to their beauty parlor...

1714
01:26:55,385 --> 01:26:56,991
and they discovered me.

1715
01:26:57,022 --> 01:26:58,524
I was so beautiful.

1716
01:26:58,557 --> 01:27:00,801
I still am the top model
in the country.

1717
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:08,452
I don't want my trial
to be held here.

1718
01:27:08,475 --> 01:27:09,785
I want it to be downtown...

1719
01:27:09,810 --> 01:27:12,383
in a large, large
theater where I belong.

1720
01:27:12,415 --> 01:27:14,863
You're a terrible
press agent.

1721
01:27:14,886 --> 01:27:16,799
They won't even
let cameras in here.

1722
01:27:16,823 --> 01:27:19,464
I'm your attorney, Dawn,
not your press agent.

1723
01:27:19,494 --> 01:27:21,738
Well, get me some
of my loungewear, then.

1724
01:27:21,766 --> 01:27:23,439
I can't be
on Walter Cronkite...

1725
01:27:23,467 --> 01:27:24,914
looking like this.

1726
01:27:24,938 --> 01:27:27,545
Did you kidnap Ida Nelson?

1727
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:30,991
No. The Dashers did it,
but they lied.

1728
01:27:31,014 --> 01:27:32,289
They're just jealous of me...

1729
01:27:32,317 --> 01:27:34,299
because I'm more famous
than they are.

1730
01:27:34,321 --> 01:27:36,199
The Dashers are liars!

1731
01:27:36,224 --> 01:27:38,866
Well, then, did you
strangle your daughter?

1732
01:27:38,895 --> 01:27:42,107
Yes, I did,
and I'm proud of it.

1733
01:27:42,134 --> 01:27:43,272
If only the Dashers...

1734
01:27:43,302 --> 01:27:45,045
hadn't destroyed
the photographs.

1735
01:27:45,073 --> 01:27:46,417
They were art.

1736
01:27:46,442 --> 01:27:49,254
You believe the death
of your daughter was art?

1737
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:50,727
Of course!

1738
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:53,095
Can't you stupid people see?

1739
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:54,829
I'm a huge star.

1740
01:27:54,857 --> 01:27:56,393
Just pick up the papers,
and you'll see...

1741
01:27:56,425 --> 01:27:57,997
my picture on the front page.

1742
01:27:58,029 --> 01:27:59,771
I'm only charged
in this matter...

1743
01:27:59,798 --> 01:28:01,780
because I'm so photogenic.

1744
01:28:01,802 --> 01:28:03,577
Why, I should be
on television...

1745
01:28:03,604 --> 01:28:04,983
right this minute!

1746
01:28:05,008 --> 01:28:07,387
What about
your nightclub act, Dawn?

1747
01:28:07,411 --> 01:28:10,054
Ooh, it was
a spectacular success,

1748
01:28:10,083 --> 01:28:12,725
a wild,
fast-moving stage show...

1749
01:28:12,755 --> 01:28:15,067
with a finale
to top all finales.

1750
01:28:15,092 --> 01:28:16,230
They loved it!

1751
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:18,242
Even the people
that died loved it!

1752
01:28:18,264 --> 01:28:19,801
How could they
not love dying...

1753
01:28:19,833 --> 01:28:21,541
if they're going to
become famous for it?

1754
01:28:21,569 --> 01:28:24,313
Oh, the jury
must realize.

1755
01:28:24,341 --> 01:28:25,685
Look at me!

1756
01:28:25,710 --> 01:28:28,158
I'm the most famous person
you've ever seen.

1757
01:28:28,181 --> 01:28:29,924
Take notes while
you have a chance.

1758
01:28:29,951 --> 01:28:31,728
Quote me! Look at me!

1759
01:28:31,755 --> 01:28:33,598
Look at my legs!
Look at 'em!

1760
01:28:33,624 --> 01:28:34,764
Bailiff...

1761
01:28:34,794 --> 01:28:37,139
remove the defendant
from the witness stand.

1762
01:28:37,164 --> 01:28:40,704
Disgusting display.

1763
01:28:40,737 --> 01:28:42,046
Publicity!

1764
01:28:42,073 --> 01:28:43,212
The death penalty!

1765
01:28:43,241 --> 01:28:44,652
Electrocution!

1766
01:28:50,287 --> 01:28:54,831
Mr. Foreman, has the jury
reached a decision?

1767
01:28:54,862 --> 01:28:57,139
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

1768
01:28:57,165 --> 01:29:00,081
We find the defendant
guilty as charged...

1769
01:29:00,105 --> 01:29:02,177
and sentence her to die
in the electric chair.

1770
01:29:12,159 --> 01:29:14,140
Matron!

1771
01:29:14,162 --> 01:29:16,144
How am I supposed to sleep...

1772
01:29:16,166 --> 01:29:18,443
with these goddamn
bugs in here?

1773
01:29:18,469 --> 01:29:21,315
Where is that hog?

1774
01:29:21,341 --> 01:29:24,086
Matron, did you hear me?

1775
01:29:24,113 --> 01:29:27,392
I come to the garden alone

1776
01:29:27,419 --> 01:29:31,894
While the dew is
still on the roses

1777
01:29:31,927 --> 01:29:36,572
And the voice I hear
ringing in my ear

1778
01:29:36,601 --> 01:29:40,883
The son of God discloses

1779
01:29:44,115 --> 01:29:46,653
I'm gonna miss
my little Dawn.

1780
01:29:46,685 --> 01:29:49,294
It ain't right they can
put you in that chair.

1781
01:29:49,324 --> 01:29:51,532
Oh, Earnestine,
I'm thrilled about it.

1782
01:29:51,561 --> 01:29:54,544
Today is my big day-

1783
01:29:54,566 --> 01:29:57,413
I feel lucky to receive
the death penalty.

1784
01:29:57,438 --> 01:30:00,820
Why, it's the biggest award
I could get in my field.

1785
01:30:00,845 --> 01:30:02,347
But I don't even have...

1786
01:30:02,379 --> 01:30:04,054
my acceptance speech ready.

1787
01:30:04,083 --> 01:30:06,189
I've got to practice it.

1788
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:07,724
I know every word I say...

1789
01:30:07,756 --> 01:30:09,760
will be
in the newspapers tomorrow.

1790
01:30:09,794 --> 01:30:11,603
Does it excite you
to make love...

1791
01:30:11,629 --> 01:30:12,837
to someone so famous?

1792
01:30:12,866 --> 01:30:15,940
You excite me, Dawn,
not your fame.

1793
01:30:15,971 --> 01:30:19,751
It's you I love.

1794
01:30:19,777 --> 01:30:21,587
I don't love publicity.

1795
01:30:21,614 --> 01:30:23,857
But I still am
the star prisoner,

1796
01:30:23,885 --> 01:30:25,058
right, Earnestine?

1797
01:30:25,087 --> 01:30:26,567
Even the warden told me...

1798
01:30:26,589 --> 01:30:28,092
he had a problem
with the press...

1799
01:30:28,125 --> 01:30:29,366
trying to get my picture.

1800
01:30:29,394 --> 01:30:30,738
Will you save my clippings?

1801
01:30:30,763 --> 01:30:32,300
I'll save 'em, Dawn.

1802
01:30:32,332 --> 01:30:34,439
I'll cry when I read 'em.

1803
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:37,009
Will you write
a book about me?

1804
01:30:37,041 --> 01:30:38,248
You know everything.

1805
01:30:38,277 --> 01:30:40,759
I trust you
to write my story.

1806
01:30:40,781 --> 01:30:43,558
Oh, describe
my makeup and hairdo.

1807
01:30:43,585 --> 01:30:44,793
Include sketches...

1808
01:30:44,821 --> 01:30:46,734
of every outfit I ever wore.

1809
01:30:46,759 --> 01:30:48,363
Oh, why won't they
let me wear...

1810
01:30:48,394 --> 01:30:50,239
a gown and makeup today?

1811
01:30:50,264 --> 01:30:52,302
Today, of all days.

1812
01:30:52,334 --> 01:30:54,612
My big moment
in the electric chair.

1813
01:30:54,638 --> 01:30:58,179
Oh, you still think
you're in a show, baby.

1814
01:30:58,211 --> 01:31:00,819
You gotta realize
it's your life!

1815
01:31:00,849 --> 01:31:02,625
But my life is a show.

1816
01:31:02,652 --> 01:31:06,626
Why is it so hard for
people to understand?

1817
01:31:06,659 --> 01:31:09,734
My fans want me to die
in the electric chair.

1818
01:31:09,765 --> 01:31:11,837
It'll be
my final curtain call...

1819
01:31:11,868 --> 01:31:14,977
the most theatrical
moment of my life.

1820
01:31:15,008 --> 01:31:16,316
I have to always try...

1821
01:31:16,343 --> 01:31:18,291
to be page one, Earnestine.

1822
01:31:18,313 --> 01:31:19,851
Life imprisonment
would have been...

1823
01:31:19,883 --> 01:31:22,125
such a second-rate news stow.

1824
01:31:22,153 --> 01:31:24,657
This way, my legend
will have to live on.

1825
01:31:24,691 --> 01:31:26,171
I'm not going to die...

1826
01:31:26,194 --> 01:31:28,142
only for my fans of today...

1827
01:31:28,163 --> 01:31:30,645
but for their children
and grandchildren.

1828
01:31:30,668 --> 01:31:35,246
Oh, you're so fucked up, baby.

1829
01:31:35,276 --> 01:31:38,282
Give mama a big, sloppy kiss.

1830
01:31:41,688 --> 01:31:43,829
Ok, "Lesbeans,"

1831
01:31:43,859 --> 01:31:45,361
I caught ya.

1832
01:31:45,394 --> 01:31:50,074
Bumping pussies is
a violation of jail rules.

1833
01:31:50,102 --> 01:31:52,641
I'm gonna write this up...

1834
01:31:52,675 --> 01:31:54,917
and give it to
the warden, Earnestine.

1835
01:31:54,944 --> 01:31:57,425
You'll get the adjustment
center for this.

1836
01:31:57,448 --> 01:31:59,727
It's her last day,
for Christ's sake.

1837
01:31:59,753 --> 01:32:01,562
Can't we spend it together?

1838
01:32:01,588 --> 01:32:05,232
Get back to your cell
before I beat you up.

1839
01:32:05,262 --> 01:32:08,770
Eh, for Christ sake,
it's her last day!

1840
01:32:08,803 --> 01:32:11,614
I know it's her last day.

1841
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:15,614
Ha ha! You all ready
for the hot seat, fatso?

1842
01:32:15,647 --> 01:32:17,253
I'm supposed to ask you...

1843
01:32:17,284 --> 01:32:19,823
what you want
for your last meal.

1844
01:32:19,855 --> 01:32:22,736
I'll have 2 veal cutlets.

1845
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:24,604
Well, I'll get 'em...

1846
01:32:24,629 --> 01:32:26,872
but you better eat 'em quick...

1847
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:28,278
'cause the electric chair...

1848
01:32:28,303 --> 01:32:30,215
don't wait for nobody...

1849
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:33,553
not even big stars like you.

1850
01:32:33,579 --> 01:32:36,619
You're gonna be
one fried lady today!

1851
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:40,997
Dawn, I came to say
good-bye to you.

1852
01:32:41,025 --> 01:32:42,664
We're going to miss you.

1853
01:32:42,695 --> 01:32:44,505
Oh, don't look so sad.

1854
01:32:44,531 --> 01:32:46,341
I'm happy. happy. happy-

1855
01:32:46,367 --> 01:32:49,112
The only thing I ask
is that you remember me

1856
01:32:49,140 --> 01:32:51,018
and talk about me
the rest of your life.

1857
01:32:51,042 --> 01:32:52,488
Oh, we will!

1858
01:32:52,512 --> 01:32:54,858
And tell everyone
they have my permission...

1859
01:32:54,883 --> 01:32:57,388
to sell their memories
of me to the media.

1860
01:32:57,420 --> 01:33:00,096
Oh, Dawn, can I
have your autograph?

1861
01:33:00,125 --> 01:33:02,437
Why, certainly, Shirl.

1862
01:33:02,463 --> 01:33:05,378
Sit down.

1863
01:33:05,401 --> 01:33:11,321
"To Shirl, the prettiest
girl on cellblock 4.

1864
01:33:11,344 --> 01:33:13,417
"Love always,

1865
01:33:13,448 --> 01:33:16,124
"The beautiful
and fabulous...

1866
01:33:16,153 --> 01:33:18,830
Dawn Davenport."

1867
01:33:18,859 --> 01:33:20,965
Oh, I'll treasure it.

1868
01:33:20,995 --> 01:33:22,998
Would you like to see
some modeling?

1869
01:33:23,032 --> 01:33:24,535
I bet you would.

1870
01:33:24,568 --> 01:33:25,878
And I don't mind.

1871
01:33:25,904 --> 01:33:28,249
I'd love to see you perform!

1872
01:33:28,274 --> 01:33:31,348
Oh, good! Ready?

1873
01:33:31,379 --> 01:33:34,454
Oh, go! Go, Dawn!

1874
01:33:39,294 --> 01:33:41,002
Get back to your cell, Shirl.

1875
01:33:41,030 --> 01:33:43,945
The show's over
for Dawn Davenport.

1876
01:33:43,969 --> 01:33:45,506
Good-bye, Dawn.

1877
01:33:45,538 --> 01:33:47,349
Good-bye, Shirl.

1878
01:33:47,375 --> 01:33:49,549
Come on. Get out
of here, Shirl.

1879
01:33:49,578 --> 01:33:51,423
Here's your food, pork chop.

1880
01:33:51,449 --> 01:33:53,487
Eat up. Ain't got much time.

1881
01:33:53,518 --> 01:33:55,500
I've changed my mind.

1882
01:33:55,522 --> 01:33:57,560
I'm really not hungry anymore.

1883
01:33:57,592 --> 01:33:58,937
Let's not dawdle.

1884
01:33:58,962 --> 01:34:01,603
I'm all ready for
my big news event.

1885
01:34:01,634 --> 01:34:04,081
I'd like to go right now
if it would be all right.

1886
01:34:04,104 --> 01:34:05,413
Suit yourself, pizza face.

1887
01:34:05,439 --> 01:34:07,478
Let's put your jewelry on
for ya.

1888
01:34:07,510 --> 01:34:08,819
Here comes the chaplain now.

1889
01:34:08,846 --> 01:34:09,917
Come on, Miss Star.

1890
01:34:09,948 --> 01:34:11,827
Your time's up.

1891
01:34:11,852 --> 01:34:14,060
Are you ready, Dawn?

1892
01:34:14,088 --> 01:34:15,660
Yes, I'm ready, Father.

1893
01:34:15,692 --> 01:34:17,103
The legend's all ready...

1894
01:34:17,127 --> 01:34:19,006
for her little appointment
in the green room.

1895
01:34:19,031 --> 01:34:20,567
I've been looking forward
to this, you know.

1896
01:34:21,702 --> 01:34:25,379
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

1897
01:34:25,408 --> 01:34:27,048
"He makes me lie down
in green pastures."

1898
01:34:27,078 --> 01:34:28,422
Good-bye, Shirl.

1899
01:34:28,447 --> 01:34:30,155
"He leads me
beside still waters..."

1900
01:34:30,183 --> 01:34:31,322
Dawn, I love you!

1901
01:34:31,352 --> 01:34:33,333
- Good-bye, Dawn!
- Good-bye, Earnestine!

1902
01:34:33,355 --> 01:34:36,066
Dawn! Good-bye Dawn!

1903
01:34:36,094 --> 01:34:37,402
Good-bye, then!

1904
01:34:37,429 --> 01:34:38,602
Bye, Dawn!

1905
01:34:46,713 --> 01:34:50,356
"O, Lord, who shall
sojourn in thy tent?

1906
01:34:50,385 --> 01:34:52,333
"Who shall dwell
in my home?"

1907
01:34:52,356 --> 01:34:54,702
Hop in!

1908
01:34:54,727 --> 01:34:58,644
Oh, cute and comfortable, too.

1909
01:34:58,667 --> 01:34:59,806
Try to resist.

1910
01:34:59,836 --> 01:35:01,646
She deserves worse than this
for what she did.

1911
01:35:01,672 --> 01:35:03,152
Yeah, better
strap 'em in good,

1912
01:35:03,174 --> 01:35:05,816
'cause you don't want me
to get out of here.

1913
01:35:05,846 --> 01:35:07,019
Hog.

1914
01:35:09,786 --> 01:35:11,528
I hate you.

1915
01:35:11,555 --> 01:35:13,468
Shut up, Davenport.

1916
01:35:15,697 --> 01:35:19,306
Ugly, ugly. ugly!

1917
01:35:26,649 --> 01:35:30,292
I'd like to thank all
the wonderful people...

1918
01:35:30,321 --> 01:35:33,829
that made this great moment
in my life come true.

1919
01:35:35,965 --> 01:35:38,709
My daughter Taffy, who died...

1920
01:35:38,737 --> 01:35:40,776
in order
to further my career.

1921
01:35:40,808 --> 01:35:43,312
My friends Chicklette
and Concetta...

1922
01:35:43,344 --> 01:35:47,318
who should be here
with me today.

1923
01:35:47,351 --> 01:35:51,029
All the fans
that died so fashionably...

1924
01:35:51,058 --> 01:35:55,407
and gallantly
at my nightclub act.

1925
01:35:55,432 --> 01:35:58,279
And especially
all those wonderful people...

1926
01:35:58,305 --> 01:35:59,443
who were kind enough...

1927
01:35:59,473 --> 01:36:01,580
to read about me
in the newspapers...

1928
01:36:01,611 --> 01:36:04,320
and watch me
on the television news shows.

1929
01:36:04,348 --> 01:36:05,795
Without all of you...

1930
01:36:05,818 --> 01:36:10,828
my career could never
have gotten this far.

1931
01:36:10,861 --> 01:36:13,138
It was you that I burn for...

1932
01:36:13,164 --> 01:36:16,910
and it is you
that I will die for.

1933
01:36:16,937 --> 01:36:18,976
Please remember...

1934
01:36:19,008 --> 01:36:22,823
I love every
fucking one of you!

1935
01:36:28,557 --> 01:36:29,799
I got lots

1936
01:36:29,827 --> 01:36:32,639
Of problems

1937
01:36:34,903 --> 01:36:37,852
Female trouble

1938
01:36:39,844 --> 01:36:43,158
Maybe I'm twisted

1939
01:36:45,387 --> 01:36:48,529
Female trouble

1940
01:36:51,599 --> 01:36:54,046
They say I'm a skank

1941
01:36:54,069 --> 01:36:56,915
But I don't care

1942
01:36:56,941 --> 01:36:58,889
Go ahead, put me

1943
01:36:58,911 --> 01:37:01,621
In your El-e-ectric chair

1944
01:37:01,649 --> 01:37:03,061
I got lots

1945
01:37:03,085 --> 01:37:05,624
Of problems

1946
01:37:07,961 --> 01:37:10,967
Female trouble

1947
01:37:12,835 --> 01:37:15,819
Maybe I'm twisted

1948
01:37:18,311 --> 01:37:21,157
Female trouble

1949
01:37:24,256 --> 01:37:26,795
Hey, spare me your morals

1950
01:37:26,827 --> 01:37:29,742
Look, everyone does

1951
01:37:29,765 --> 01:37:31,974
What pleases me

1952
01:37:32,003 --> 01:37:34,416
Is paradise

1953
01:37:34,439 --> 01:37:35,578
I got lots

1954
01:37:35,609 --> 01:37:38,181
Of problems

1955
01:37:40,718 --> 01:37:43,563
Female trouble

1956
01:37:45,443 --> 01:37:46,945
Maybe I'm twisted...

1957
01:37:52,444 --> 01:37:55,947
