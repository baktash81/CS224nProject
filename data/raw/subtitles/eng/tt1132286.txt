1
00:01:16,936 --> 00:01:22,738
The dust returns to the ground it came from,
the Spirit returns to the Lord who gave it.

2
00:01:23,443 --> 00:01:26,513
Even in sorrow we thank you Lord.

3
00:01:26,513 --> 00:01:30,049
For Jim Shaw has gone home.

4
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:32,017
Home.

5
00:01:43,563 --> 00:01:47,333
l don't see as l've got the strength
to drive us home.

6
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:48,732
l can.

7
00:01:51,004 --> 00:01:55,100
l just wanted to go with you, just one time.

8
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:04,383
Mandie, you're gonna ruin your dress.

9
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:18,063
No.

10
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:31,377
Ned.

11
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,182
Come home with us. Please.

12
00:02:36,182 --> 00:02:38,150
l see you tonight, Papoose.

13
00:02:41,921 --> 00:02:43,889
Go home.

14
00:03:10,984 --> 00:03:17,624
Daddy says he does have family. But then he
died without saying who they were or where.

15
00:03:17,624 --> 00:03:19,892
You have me.

16
00:03:19,892 --> 00:03:22,195
l want real family.

17
00:03:22,195 --> 00:03:24,530
What is real family?

18
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,600
Relatives. People with my blood.

19
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,937
l got plenty of real family like
your Mother and lrene.

20
00:03:30,937 --> 00:03:33,940
They don't amount to nothing compared to you.

21
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,205
They amount to everything.

22
00:03:41,881 --> 00:03:45,180
So what are you gonna do?

23
00:03:52,058 --> 00:03:55,084
Could you please take that creature out of here?

24
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:12,345
Child, l feel right sorry for you. Etta must have
done lost her mind with grief to be hiring you out.

25
00:04:12,345 --> 00:04:16,783
Fact is, after watching you work,
l'd take you in myself if l had the room.

26
00:04:16,783 --> 00:04:20,586
Be a lot better than living two counties
away with them Bryson folks.

27
00:04:20,586 --> 00:04:25,182
Poor thing. You won't never get to
see your friends or family, with you?

28
00:04:26,793 --> 00:04:29,529
Momma!

29
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:32,521
Why did my husband die?

30
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:46,679
We'd be leaving right now.

31
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:52,785
WELL. l shot a rabbit. First try.

32
00:04:52,785 --> 00:04:55,221
Bulls-eye.

33
00:04:55,221 --> 00:04:57,189
That a girl.

34
00:05:12,171 --> 00:05:16,576
- l told him the mossy rock was slippery.
- Watch out for that mossy one!

35
00:05:16,576 --> 00:05:19,773
But he didn't believe me.

36
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,348
NO!

37
00:05:22,348 --> 00:05:26,114
DADDY!
My Daddy is strong.

38
00:05:26,686 --> 00:05:32,022
DADDY! You should have seen
him all sopping wet fight that wolf.

39
00:05:34,694 --> 00:05:38,731
l had his arms balanced over my
shoulders and l talked non-stop.

40
00:05:38,731 --> 00:05:42,201
Convinced him that there was
nothing to be afraid of.

41
00:05:42,201 --> 00:05:46,839
lied. l was terrified.

42
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:50,036
Come here.

43
00:06:06,893 --> 00:06:10,829
Daddy, now can l go on a hunting trip with you?

44
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:21,568
When you can shoot an arrow into the deer
target's heart, then you can come.

45
00:06:26,712 --> 00:06:30,550
You' get your bulls-eye next year for sure.

46
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,680
l hate it when you leave. l hate being
home alone with Momma and lrene.

47
00:06:42,295 --> 00:06:46,459
Once upon a time, there
lived an lndian princess.

48
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,372
l get the big one! The big one's mine!

49
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:55,174
Don't l Momma?

50
00:06:55,174 --> 00:06:57,142
Yes Darling.

51
00:07:09,755 --> 00:07:12,087
Hello little kitty!

52
00:07:13,292 --> 00:07:15,886
Oh thank you Daddy!

53
00:07:21,534 --> 00:07:23,502
Achooo!

54
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:31,233
Please keep that cat out of my face and
out of my kitchen and off of my bed.

55
00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:42,153
One for lrene.

56
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,682
And another for lrene.

57
00:07:59,372 --> 00:08:03,776
Daddy, wasn't l a good girl this year?
l'm at least better than lrene.

58
00:08:03,776 --> 00:08:07,713
You're the best girl. Always.

59
00:08:07,713 --> 00:08:11,240
l had planned to wait till you were older.

60
00:08:13,686 --> 00:08:15,654
But.

61
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:19,625
Daddy, now can l go on a hunting trip with you?

62
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:25,086
When you can shoot an arrow into the deer
target's heart, then you can come.

63
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,068
Bulls-eye!

64
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:35,541
- Wanna read with me?
- No, l want to sew.

65
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:38,144
Then l'll read to you.

66
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:39,712
Please?

67
00:08:39,712 --> 00:08:42,114
lf you distract me, my stitches won't be pretty.

68
00:08:42,114 --> 00:08:45,351
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic.

69
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:47,842
l'll read with you.

70
00:08:48,187 --> 00:08:51,724
No, tell me the lndian Princess story.

71
00:08:51,724 --> 00:08:55,127
l hate that story.

72
00:08:55,127 --> 00:09:00,232
- Once upon a time -
- ln the land of falling waters and rising earth -

73
00:09:00,232 --> 00:09:05,204
- The Cherokee lndians lived in peace.
- But the winds of greed -

74
00:09:05,204 --> 00:09:10,376
Brought soldiers on horseback who
drove a Cherokee from their homes.

75
00:09:10,376 --> 00:09:13,613
And marched them for many
moons along the trail of tears.

76
00:09:13,613 --> 00:09:15,414
- But there were some -

77
00:09:15,414 --> 00:09:17,917
- Who refused to leave the
land of their ancestors.

78
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:22,755
Whispers say than an lndian princess and her
pregnant sister were given shelter...

79
00:09:22,755 --> 00:09:28,894
...in a roomlike a cathedral with windows
so high only eagles could see through.

80
00:09:28,894 --> 00:09:32,531
Stop, stop, stop! You can't
just skip the whole middle.

81
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:40,165
Tell me the part about the campfire fight and
boulder mountain and the white archer.

82
00:09:44,176 --> 00:09:50,547
l wish the lndian Princess was real.
l wish she was my big sister.

83
00:09:54,387 --> 00:09:56,455
Jim?

84
00:09:56,455 --> 00:10:03,793
- Did you milk the cows this morning?
- Yes sir. And l hauled water.

85
00:10:06,198 --> 00:10:08,868
You don't have any family anywhere?

86
00:10:08,868 --> 00:10:10,536
No.

87
00:10:10,536 --> 00:10:14,006
Well then when are you and Momma
gonna have me a baby brother?

88
00:10:14,006 --> 00:10:15,974
We're not.

89
00:10:16,609 --> 00:10:21,205
But brothers aren't good for
anything except causing a ruckus.

90
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:43,636
- Hello Ned!
- Papoose!

91
00:10:43,636 --> 00:10:51,343
Can l come with you? lt'll be forever before l hit
the bulls-eye. Please let me go.

92
00:10:51,343 --> 00:10:54,437
Too little Papoose.

93
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:58,175
Take care of Momma and lrene now.

94
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:55,140
Daddy!

95
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,647
For Snowball.

96
00:12:14,894 --> 00:12:19,765
The lndian Princess fought furiously
with her family around the flickering fire.

97
00:12:19,765 --> 00:12:24,770
Father and brothers wanted to stay in
their home and and hide from the soldiers.

98
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:30,309
But the wise princess, who
they called Talitha Pindar, argued.

99
00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:34,480
How long can we elude
soldiers with a pregnant woman?

100
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,851
As Princess Talitha sewed,
Father silenced the family.

101
00:12:38,851 --> 00:12:43,914
They would stay on their
and and they would hide.

102
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:33,606
You treat them lnjuns better
than you treat your own family.

103
00:13:33,606 --> 00:13:39,178
l wish l was an lndian Princess. You'd take me
on your hunting trips, wouldn't you?

104
00:13:39,178 --> 00:13:42,214
- l might.
- You would.

105
00:13:42,214 --> 00:13:44,717
You'll hit your bulls-eye sooner than you think.

106
00:13:44,717 --> 00:13:47,553
Tell me the lndian Princess story. All of it.

107
00:13:47,553 --> 00:13:52,291
Once upon a time, there
lived an lndian Princess.

108
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,895
Mandie! You think you could
shoot us something for dinner?

109
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:13,612
- Whew! l'm freezing.
- Wanna go in?

110
00:14:13,612 --> 00:14:15,580
Yeah.

111
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:29,386
Kinda drafty in here, isn't it?

112
00:14:35,401 --> 00:14:39,071
- Take me with you. Anywhere.
- Papoose.

113
00:14:39,071 --> 00:14:42,441
We have to find Snowball
and go to Daddy's grave.

114
00:14:42,441 --> 00:14:44,877
AMANDA SHAW!

115
00:14:44,877 --> 00:14:46,578
Or else you'll never see me again.

116
00:14:46,578 --> 00:14:49,815
'Cause Momma's hiring me out for work for
someone far, far away.

117
00:14:49,815 --> 00:14:51,383
AMANDA!

118
00:14:51,383 --> 00:14:55,587
Zach! That lnjun is kidnapping my daughter!

119
00:14:55,587 --> 00:14:59,023
AMANDA!
AMANDA SHAW!

120
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:05,258
STOP, lNJUN! There be major
consequences for kidnapping!

121
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:15,797
AMANDA!
MANDlE SHAW!

122
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:44,336
- AMANDA!
- Go. Now.

123
00:15:44,336 --> 00:15:47,773
Daddy needs flowers.

124
00:15:47,773 --> 00:15:51,343
- Mandie!
- Amanda, where are you? - Mandie!

125
00:15:51,343 --> 00:15:55,109
You have Uncle.

126
00:15:56,682 --> 00:16:01,585
Father's brother. We go!

127
00:16:28,013 --> 00:16:29,981
HELLO!

128
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:39,454
Ssshhhhhh!
We go!

129
00:17:10,055 --> 00:17:12,023
Whoah.

130
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:15,494
Well hey Snowball.

131
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:23,802
Boys, that there is the meanest, meowinest
excuse for a kitty-cat l ever saw.

132
00:17:23,802 --> 00:17:27,670
lt'll be my distinct pleasure to put him out of my
misery.

133
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,176
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

134
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:33,144
Run Snowball!

135
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,208
Ned.

136
00:19:16,481 --> 00:19:19,618
What's my Uncle's name?

137
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:21,586
John.

138
00:19:32,831 --> 00:19:36,426
Uncle John's house, behind mountain.

139
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:01,260
Without a moment to lose, the lndian Princess
and her family raced through an open field.

140
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:07,665
The galloping of pursuing soldiers
echoed louder and louder.

141
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:14,840
lf they could only reach the
top of boulder mountain...

142
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,277
...they would find safety for a few moons.

143
00:20:35,794 --> 00:20:43,098
Upward they pushed, grateful for the hide and
seek rocks that provided cover.

144
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,007
AH!

145
00:20:50,142 --> 00:20:54,579
But exhaust on and pain overcame.

146
00:20:59,584 --> 00:21:07,514
Father promised he would return for them, but
deep down, they all knew it would be too late.

147
00:21:24,009 --> 00:21:25,977
Whoah! Whoah!

148
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:18,697
Ned.
Do you know Uncle John?

149
00:22:18,697 --> 00:22:21,633
Many w nters ago.

150
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:23,702
Why don't l?

151
00:22:23,702 --> 00:22:28,473
Best ask Uncle John.

152
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:30,675
What's he like?

153
00:22:30,675 --> 00:22:32,643
You see tomorrow.

154
00:22:51,129 --> 00:22:54,860
Go on.
We not come.

155
00:22:56,401 --> 00:22:57,569
Go.

156
00:22:57,569 --> 00:23:02,040
To family.
Big love there.

157
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,843
When will l see you again?

158
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:06,811
Soon.

159
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,887
Go.

160
00:24:00,532 --> 00:24:02,868
What in heaven's blue blazes are you?

161
00:24:02,868 --> 00:24:05,735
Where's Uncle John?

162
00:24:07,138 --> 00:24:10,266
Stay put right here.

163
00:24:36,835 --> 00:24:39,604
Are you Uncle John?

164
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:42,807
Are you an angel?

165
00:24:42,807 --> 00:24:46,311
l am Samuel, an artist.

166
00:24:46,311 --> 00:24:51,180
And you are my painting, the painting.
Perfect.

167
00:25:17,842 --> 00:25:19,810
- Hello.
- Hello.

168
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,316
You don't look a thing like my Father.

169
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:27,185
Well l should think not.

170
00:25:27,185 --> 00:25:32,714
But then neither do you, except for the eyes.

171
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:37,262
l'm Jason Bond, the estate keeper.

172
00:25:37,262 --> 00:25:39,164
Where's Uncle John?

173
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:41,800
Where's your Father?

174
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,768
You knew him?

175
00:25:43,768 --> 00:25:45,736
Knew him?

176
00:25:46,304 --> 00:25:50,331
No. Oh. Come right here. Right here.

177
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:54,446
Where's Uncle John?

178
00:25:54,446 --> 00:26:00,351
John Shaw took a boat for Europe not long ago.

179
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:06,758
And this week we received a message.

180
00:26:06,758 --> 00:26:11,229
There's been a terrible storm.

181
00:26:11,229 --> 00:26:15,834
Oh, l'm so sorry, child. So sorry.

182
00:26:15,834 --> 00:26:21,473
That's right, let it out. Them tears need
to see the light of day, yes they do.

183
00:26:21,473 --> 00:26:25,176
- l'm so sorry.
- Do you have a Mother?

184
00:26:25,176 --> 00:26:28,613
The kind that wouldn't care if
she never saw me again.

185
00:26:28,613 --> 00:26:32,117
- What's your name, pudding cakes?
- Mandie.

186
00:26:32,117 --> 00:26:35,553
Liza, Miss Mandie needs something
hot going right away.

187
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:41,059
Should be leftover biscuits, ham,
and some baked apples to start.

188
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:43,461
- Yes Ma'am.
- And she should have a bath.

189
00:26:43,461 --> 00:26:49,234
-l'm too tired to haul any water.
- Child, pipes haul our water.

190
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:53,638
Samuel, run a hot bath
in the French room.

191
00:26:53,638 --> 00:26:55,373
Anything for the Angel, sir.

192
00:26:55,373 --> 00:27:01,413
Why are you being so nice to me?
l have nobody, l am nobody.

193
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:05,417
l'm just some runaway dirtying up your mansion.

194
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:12,390
Stuffin' nonsense Miss Mandie. Having
nobody don't equate to being nobody.

195
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:17,562
Liza, l'll finish the cooking.

196
00:27:17,562 --> 00:27:23,057
You take her on up and see if you can salvage
any hair out of this here rat nest.

197
00:27:53,098 --> 00:27:58,058
- How'd you do that?
- You never seen electricity?

198
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:03,508
You want light, you just flip the switch right here.

199
00:28:03,508 --> 00:28:09,208
Energy travels through the wires hidden
in the walls all over the house.

200
00:28:12,183 --> 00:28:14,085
Who built this place?

201
00:28:14,085 --> 00:28:17,088
Your Grandpa. John Shaw Senior.

202
00:28:17,088 --> 00:28:19,724
You even got your own bathroom.

203
00:28:19,724 --> 00:28:21,692
What's a bathroom?

204
00:28:29,567 --> 00:28:32,570
l thinks l need the whole bottle
for this here rat's nest.

205
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:34,572
l can wash my own hair.

206
00:28:34,572 --> 00:28:36,174
Now Miss Mandie....

207
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:41,737
Ain't nobody in all of North Carolina who can
give a head-washing like Liza Louise.

208
00:28:48,052 --> 00:28:51,544
May the good Lord bless your dreams, child.

209
00:28:56,127 --> 00:29:00,325
Aunt Lou, do you have family, chidren?

210
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:08,940
l have four, and l suspect they's a getting
reacquainted with your Father right about now.

211
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,908
A four?

212
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,878
l'm so sorry.

213
00:29:18,683 --> 00:29:21,152
l ran away the night of the funeral .

214
00:29:21,152 --> 00:29:24,656
The running was good, kept me busy.

215
00:29:24,656 --> 00:29:28,893
But tomorrow, when l wake up and
my Daddy and Uncle are gone...

216
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:31,496
...what do l do all day long?

217
00:29:31,496 --> 00:29:35,133
What you do, is you don't fight the pain.

218
00:29:35,133 --> 00:29:37,468
You feel it.

219
00:29:37,468 --> 00:29:41,539
And l'll feei it with you, and Mr. Jason Bond too.

220
00:29:41,539 --> 00:29:43,908
And you ask the Good Lord to hurt with you.

221
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:48,379
He suffered as much as everybody
in the whole world combined...

222
00:29:48,379 --> 00:29:51,583
...which means He'll comfort you
better than any of us.

223
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:54,485
l'm sorry, but l'm not asking God for anything.

224
00:29:54,485 --> 00:29:57,488
l'm too mad at him.

225
00:29:57,488 --> 00:29:59,591
ls that wrong?

226
00:29:59,591 --> 00:30:01,559
No, Child.

227
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:04,696
Fact is, you oughta tell him you're mad.

228
00:30:04,696 --> 00:30:07,365
And keep telling him as long as you are.

229
00:30:07,365 --> 00:30:12,325
And one day, you might find that you ask
him to help you to stop being mad.

230
00:30:13,371 --> 00:30:16,169
l'll think about it.

231
00:30:30,054 --> 00:30:32,690
How in heaven's name did that child get here?

232
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:35,226
l have no idea.

233
00:30:35,226 --> 00:30:37,629
l wonder how much she knows.

234
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:41,766
Well, as private as that family is,
probably not much.

235
00:30:41,766 --> 00:30:47,505
And l'll tell you something Lou, we're
gonna keep our mouths shut too.

236
00:30:47,505 --> 00:30:51,075
l cannot find Mr. John's will.

237
00:30:51,075 --> 00:30:56,114
Can't find the will? What in tarnation are you
doing wasting precious time down here for?

238
00:30:56,114 --> 00:30:59,117
Because it could be anywhere.

239
00:30:59,117 --> 00:31:04,077
Mr. Jason. Where do you find a man's heart?

240
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:08,649
Same place you find his treasure.
Am l right?

241
00:31:10,595 --> 00:31:15,667
Well just flip it around. Because
we know where his heart was.

242
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:19,470
Third floor.
And the hidden places.

243
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:23,641
Why don't you just run right up
there, Lou, and start searching?

244
00:31:23,641 --> 00:31:26,644
No sir.

245
00:31:26,644 --> 00:31:28,612
Precisely.

246
00:31:32,583 --> 00:31:36,187
l know. Let's get Miss Mandie to help you.

247
00:31:36,187 --> 00:31:40,024
She needs something to do and if she knew her
Daddy might be included in the will -

248
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:42,360
No, no, no.

249
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:47,730
l won't get her hopes up like that. Not
until l know exactly who's in that will.

250
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:53,330
Well there's much more possibilties
when the hopes is raised.

251
00:31:54,072 --> 00:31:59,344
You do know that hot eggs taste
better than cold ones, don't ya?

252
00:31:59,344 --> 00:32:01,713
Did you sleep we last night?

253
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:03,681
Good.

254
00:32:11,456 --> 00:32:17,562
l, uh, was wondering if l could enlist your help.

255
00:32:17,562 --> 00:32:23,134
He's in a fix. And he really needs you and your
Shaw way of thinking, but you best hurry.

256
00:32:23,134 --> 00:32:28,473
Aunt Lou. l wonder if you could
bring us some honey for the biscuits.

257
00:32:28,473 --> 00:32:31,408
- Coming right up.
- Thank you very much.

258
00:32:34,212 --> 00:32:38,583
Your Uncle John had a will.

259
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:46,357
Now it's possible, just possible that he
left most of what he owned to your Daddy.

260
00:32:46,357 --> 00:32:48,893
Which would mean it would all pass to you...

261
00:32:48,893 --> 00:32:52,989
...and you would never have to go
back to that Momma of yours.

262
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:04,976
lt's just a possibility, Mandie.
Don't get your hopes up.

263
00:33:04,976 --> 00:33:08,613
Why would he leave anything to
a man he wasn't speaking to?

264
00:33:08,613 --> 00:33:12,150
Because the only legitimate
relatives he has are in Virginia.

265
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:15,449
Distant cousins. l don't think he ever met them.

266
00:33:18,156 --> 00:33:20,989
Ah, perfect timing.

267
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,828
Excuse me.

268
00:33:23,828 --> 00:33:23,928
Excuse me.

269
00:33:23,928 --> 00:33:27,865
Momma said it wouldn't be polite
to come over before ten o'clock.

270
00:33:27,865 --> 00:33:32,270
But l couldn't wait a single moment
longer to meet my new friend. l apologize.

271
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:37,765
l assure you Miss Mandie won't
mind your neglection of etiquette.

272
00:33:40,044 --> 00:33:43,981
l'm Polly Cornwallis, and l get to
spend the next five nights with you!

273
00:33:43,981 --> 00:33:48,052
Momma said this past week's been nothing
but rotten, and l want you to know.....

274
00:33:48,052 --> 00:33:53,424
....that l've got just the cheerful
disposition you need to be around.

275
00:33:53,424 --> 00:33:58,629
Now, first thing we must do is cajole Aunt Lou
into sewing you some new clothes....

276
00:33:58,629 --> 00:34:02,767
...because that dress, l apologize,
is not fit for the trash heap.

277
00:34:02,767 --> 00:34:05,002
Aunt Lou can do a fitting right after lunch.

278
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:07,338
l love Providential timing!

279
00:34:07,338 --> 00:34:09,874
l've never had a new dress in all my life.

280
00:34:09,874 --> 00:34:14,334
You be one deprived child. But
we gonna enjoy fixing that.

281
00:34:17,548 --> 00:34:20,016
Thank you, Liza.

282
00:34:25,656 --> 00:34:29,558
Jason Bond. A pleasure to finally meet you.

283
00:34:31,062 --> 00:34:35,633
l am Miss Gaynelle Snow, John Shaw's niece.

284
00:34:35,633 --> 00:34:39,660
l was, l am devastated.

285
00:34:42,406 --> 00:34:47,245
But since part of the inheritance will be mine...

286
00:34:47,245 --> 00:34:51,349
...l've come to offer you my assistance
in helping you sort through his things.

287
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:52,884
Ah hah.

288
00:34:52,884 --> 00:34:54,418
l have a cousin?

289
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:56,154
No.

290
00:34:56,154 --> 00:35:00,758
Well l don't believe l know this
beautiful young lady.

291
00:35:00,758 --> 00:35:04,023
This beautiful young lady...

292
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:08,399
...is John Shaw's niece, Mandie.

293
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:13,471
Oh my sweet dear, l have always
wanted another girl in the family.

294
00:35:13,471 --> 00:35:16,507
My Mother was John's youngest sister.

295
00:35:16,507 --> 00:35:19,477
Grew up in Richmond, Virginia and
was sent away at a very young age...

296
00:35:19,477 --> 00:35:23,208
...and died bringing me into this world.

297
00:35:25,149 --> 00:35:28,819
Do you think l could have a
room next to my long lost cousin?

298
00:35:28,819 --> 00:35:33,391
You know, Miss Snow, it's a peculiar thing,
l don't ever remember John Shaw...

299
00:35:33,391 --> 00:35:36,087
...mentioning a sister.

300
00:35:41,332 --> 00:35:45,136
Well, ain't we just the place to
be this blessed morning.

301
00:35:45,136 --> 00:35:48,105
Just come on in.

302
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:52,743
Hello. My name is Bayne Locke.

303
00:35:52,743 --> 00:35:55,109
- l am John Shaw's nephew.
- Ah.
- Here to claim my part -
- Of the inheritance.

304
00:35:57,848 --> 00:36:01,752
Of course, of course. Well this is just
fascinating, they're coming from a over...

305
00:36:01,752 --> 00:36:04,121
...the country to claim his property.

306
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:07,391
- Sir, John Shaw's sister was my Mother.
- Ah.

307
00:36:07,391 --> 00:36:09,260
- She died.
- Oh.

308
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,696
ln childbirth.

309
00:36:11,696 --> 00:36:14,432
And in what town were you born?

310
00:36:14,432 --> 00:36:17,001
Richmond, Virginia.

311
00:36:17,001 --> 00:36:21,339
Richmond, Virginia. Well this is
a coincidence. So was she.

312
00:36:21,339 --> 00:36:23,941
- Oh!
- Maybe you two are twins, separated...

313
00:36:23,941 --> 00:36:26,644
- ...at birth perhaps.
- l always wanted a brother.

314
00:36:26,644 --> 00:36:28,813
Oh, well l have the papers to prove it.

315
00:36:28,813 --> 00:36:31,849
How will we be dividing the estate?

316
00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:34,841
Come here.

317
00:36:37,054 --> 00:36:42,693
We will be dividing the estate
according to the will.

318
00:36:42,693 --> 00:36:46,264
Oh. Good. Good, good.

319
00:36:46,264 --> 00:36:47,865
May l see it, please?

320
00:36:47,865 --> 00:36:49,833
No. No, no.

321
00:36:50,801 --> 00:36:54,396
Not now, not ever.

322
00:36:57,575 --> 00:36:59,443
Bring in my bag.

323
00:36:59,443 --> 00:37:01,843
Bring in your own bag.

324
00:37:03,481 --> 00:37:08,619
Liza, tell Aunt Lou that we're
now running a free hotel.

325
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:11,555
And would you please take
our guests up to their rooms?

326
00:37:11,555 --> 00:37:13,357
Yes Sir.

327
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:16,093
Oh and l am famished.

328
00:37:16,093 --> 00:37:19,130
Might l bother you to scare up a
small bite from the kitchen for me?

329
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:22,199
- lf it's not too much trouble.
- Yes Ma'am.

330
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:27,831
And l would like a full breakfast, please.

331
00:37:34,945 --> 00:37:40,247
Take Polly. Go to the third floor. Be quiet.

332
00:38:17,955 --> 00:38:23,027
Perhaps l should choose fabric
for your new dress instead.

333
00:38:23,027 --> 00:38:24,995
No!

334
00:38:40,511 --> 00:38:44,208
That needs redecorating.

335
00:39:13,677 --> 00:39:17,114
The white archer sailed often to the orient.

336
00:39:17,114 --> 00:39:19,817
He loved the colors he found there.

337
00:39:19,817 --> 00:39:22,319
Jade especially.

338
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:29,226
Hidden timber guarded two entrances to two
secret passageways to the cathedral room.

339
00:39:29,226 --> 00:39:35,722
But the hand-made, far-East treasure
trunks guarded a manner of secrets.

340
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,618
Polly!

341
00:39:57,388 --> 00:40:00,880
Help me move this.

342
00:40:20,544 --> 00:40:22,512
Jumpin' jiminey!

343
00:40:27,151 --> 00:40:34,191
l don't think Mr. Jason meant for us
to search this part of the third floor.

344
00:40:34,191 --> 00:40:36,159
Scared?

345
00:40:48,305 --> 00:40:51,934
Let's see where it goes.

346
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:13,397
They stepped into the unknown
with a sense of unease...

347
00:41:13,397 --> 00:41:17,493
...and closed the door upon all that was familiar.

348
00:41:50,067 --> 00:41:56,840
Mandie Shaw! l absolutely, positively will not
descend into that black abyss....

349
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,810
...unless escorted by a boy!

350
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:01,778
Honest?

351
00:42:14,858 --> 00:42:16,826
Mandie!

352
00:42:41,218 --> 00:42:46,957
The lndian Princess Talitha wore a forehead
braid to make wise her thoughts.

353
00:42:46,957 --> 00:42:51,792
And an antler necklace to
protect the secrets of her heart.

354
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:08,112
Mandie. Look where we are.

355
00:43:08,112 --> 00:43:10,080
Polly.

356
00:43:13,017 --> 00:43:15,285
Ned gave this to me.

357
00:43:15,285 --> 00:43:19,244
- Who's Ned?
- My lndian friend.

358
00:43:20,758 --> 00:43:23,360
l don't think we should be in here anymore.

359
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:26,964
l would simply be beside myself
if l could move into this room.

360
00:43:26,964 --> 00:43:31,235
Such vibrant colors. So modern.

361
00:43:31,235 --> 00:43:34,238
Land sakes, Miss Snow, l thought
you wanted to be next to Mandie.

362
00:43:34,238 --> 00:43:36,206
l did.

363
00:43:36,206 --> 00:43:38,075
Oh! What a beautiful view.

364
00:43:38,075 --> 00:43:41,211
And all hidden up here on the third
floor where no one can enjoy it.

365
00:43:41,211 --> 00:43:43,981
Oh you simply must come see.

366
00:43:43,981 --> 00:43:47,484
- Oh. l do see.
- No you come right here.

367
00:43:47,484 --> 00:43:51,221
You know them sheets there? They
ain't be washed in quite some time.

368
00:43:51,221 --> 00:43:53,657
Well Liza can do that this morning.

369
00:43:53,657 --> 00:43:57,294
Ain't been a lick of fresh air to
fly through here in years.

370
00:43:57,294 --> 00:43:59,897
Well by tonight a breeze will
have freshened everything up....

371
00:43:59,897 --> 00:44:03,890
...so it really isn't too much
of a problem now, is it?

372
00:44:04,868 --> 00:44:06,836
Well, now, l reckon not.

373
00:44:08,238 --> 00:44:12,643
lf you don't mind sharing your bedroom with rats.

374
00:44:12,643 --> 00:44:17,347
Rats! l hate rats!

375
00:44:17,347 --> 00:44:23,115
l can do lizards, snakes even
spiders, anything but rats!

376
00:45:00,657 --> 00:45:03,427
A l did was follow her.

377
00:45:03,427 --> 00:45:05,395
Ah.

378
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:12,833
Miss Amanda, you are
without a doubt a Shaw relative.

379
00:45:13,904 --> 00:45:19,035
Truth be told, you're probably better
equipped to find this will than l am.

380
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:24,438
You could run across some other things as well.

381
00:45:26,183 --> 00:45:28,352
Your Uncle John had a lot of secrets.

382
00:45:28,352 --> 00:45:32,055
So did my Father, and l wish he hadn't.

383
00:45:32,055 --> 00:45:35,388
Please let us search this room,
we'll find it, l promise.

384
00:45:36,627 --> 00:45:38,595
All right.

385
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:44,468
All right. Work fast. Stay very quiet.

386
00:45:44,468 --> 00:45:51,575
And whatever you do, under no circumstances
allow Ms. Snow or Mr. Locke to follow you.

387
00:45:51,575 --> 00:46:00,313
lf either one of them find the will first, they'll take
your Daddy's name off of it, do you understand?

388
00:46:14,198 --> 00:46:16,366
Too old- ladyish.

389
00:46:16,366 --> 00:46:17,835
l agree.

390
00:46:17,835 --> 00:46:22,606
Miss Polly, would you help Miss
Mandie pick out fabric for a fancy dress?

391
00:46:22,606 --> 00:46:25,776
Two new dresses at one time?

392
00:46:25,776 --> 00:46:28,879
Momma would say that's wasteful.

393
00:46:28,879 --> 00:46:30,647
Oh!

394
00:46:30,647 --> 00:46:35,914
Ladies! Why didn't you tell me
we were having a sewing part?

395
00:46:36,687 --> 00:46:40,657
l just love making new dresses
for myself. Oh yes.

396
00:46:40,657 --> 00:46:43,794
And how many dresses do you own, Ms. Snow?

397
00:46:43,794 --> 00:46:47,457
Oh, um, only five, maybe six.

398
00:46:52,002 --> 00:46:56,996
Ah! Cats! l hate cats!

399
00:46:59,776 --> 00:47:03,480
l just love making new dresses for myself.

400
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,448
Lovely, lovely.

401
00:47:08,051 --> 00:47:11,214
What beautiful fabric!

402
00:47:19,963 --> 00:47:23,694
Miss Mandie, we'll finish up later.
Get you on outta here.

403
00:47:44,388 --> 00:47:47,824
This mansion is twice the size of ours.

404
00:49:05,969 --> 00:49:07,937
She's stealing!

405
00:49:57,921 --> 00:50:02,726
Remember when you were that age, Mr. Locke?

406
00:50:02,726 --> 00:50:08,995
You didn't realize how quickly you'd become the
young gentleman you are today, did you?

407
00:50:18,542 --> 00:50:21,311
Samuel! We're in need of your assistance.

408
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:23,279
Yes, Ma'am!

409
00:50:28,085 --> 00:50:30,287
At your service.

410
00:50:30,287 --> 00:50:33,523
We need a boy to go exploring with us.

411
00:50:33,523 --> 00:50:35,225
Can you keep a secret?

412
00:50:35,225 --> 00:50:38,361
No Ma'am. No one trusts me with anything.

413
00:50:38,361 --> 00:50:43,767
Oh. Well, can you keep one for me?

414
00:50:43,767 --> 00:50:46,837
Maybe. Can't make any promises though.

415
00:50:46,837 --> 00:50:50,540
My loud mouth tends to run
faster than my brain can keep up.

416
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:53,410
Well do you know any boys
who can keep secrets?

417
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:56,743
No Ma'am. Stay away from all of them.

418
00:51:11,828 --> 00:51:16,197
l say anything done in moderation
is perfectly acceptable.

419
00:51:23,907 --> 00:51:29,312
But reading a seven-hundred and eighty-seven
page book standing up seems rather excessive.

420
00:51:29,312 --> 00:51:31,280
Don't you think?

421
00:51:32,849 --> 00:51:34,817
Are you sidetracked?

422
00:51:36,887 --> 00:51:40,857
l'll find that will before you ever do.

423
00:51:40,857 --> 00:51:40,957
l'll find that will before you ever do.

424
00:51:40,957 --> 00:51:43,482
You're positive it hasn't already been found?

425
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:12,889
What was my Uncle like, other
than rich and untidy?

426
00:52:12,889 --> 00:52:18,623
Old. l used to imagine how
dapper he might look if he smiled.

427
00:52:19,729 --> 00:52:23,667
Do you know what happened
between him and my Father?

428
00:52:23,667 --> 00:52:26,363
l'd say only Mr. Jason knows that.

429
00:52:32,142 --> 00:52:35,278
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- l done had it.

430
00:52:35,278 --> 00:52:37,547
You ain't accomplishing a
lick with a your pacing.

431
00:52:37,547 --> 00:52:39,983
Would you please just get to work?

432
00:52:39,983 --> 00:52:43,386
What if we can't find the will?

433
00:52:43,386 --> 00:52:46,623
All l know is the Good Lord's
gonna take care of Miss Mandie.

434
00:52:46,623 --> 00:52:50,024
Even if it's not the way we want him to.
Now get!

435
00:52:53,797 --> 00:52:55,532
Now get?

436
00:52:55,532 --> 00:52:57,500
Now get.

437
00:53:22,926 --> 00:53:26,730
l was saving it for your eighteenth birthday.

438
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:31,835
But somehow you always manage to
get things out of me earlier than planned.

439
00:53:31,835 --> 00:53:34,070
l can wait, Daddy.

440
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:36,038
Put it on.

441
00:53:39,876 --> 00:53:41,844
Beautiful.

442
00:53:52,088 --> 00:53:56,226
Joe! Joe could come help us!

443
00:53:56,226 --> 00:53:58,888
ls he cute?

444
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:04,098
Miss Mandie. Would you like
to try on your new dress?

445
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:10,896
Snowball! Snow?

446
00:54:22,485 --> 00:54:24,354
'Scuse me, Ma'am?

447
00:54:24,354 --> 00:54:30,493
You do smell right pretty, but now this here soap
is gonna make you smell even prettier.

448
00:54:30,493 --> 00:54:33,330
That's 'cause of its special ingredient.

449
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:35,298
Mmmmm. What ingredient?

450
00:54:38,368 --> 00:54:43,237
We , now surely you don't expect
me to give up all my secrets. Hmmm?

451
00:54:50,613 --> 00:54:52,581
Well l'll be darned.

452
00:54:53,983 --> 00:54:59,944
You happen to hear of a little blonde girl showing
up in these parts, with a white kitty-cat?

453
00:55:03,159 --> 00:55:06,730
This is too pretty to wear. l'll mess it up.

454
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:13,602
Child, that's your play dress. Now
the fancy dress, that'll be a sight to see.

455
00:55:18,141 --> 00:55:20,666
This kitty-cat belong here?

456
00:55:23,246 --> 00:55:25,214
Yes.

457
00:55:27,984 --> 00:55:29,952
Good.

458
00:55:30,687 --> 00:55:35,021
Now, would you direct me to the most
comfortable chair in the house?

459
00:55:36,593 --> 00:55:39,255
Never mind, l'll find it on my own.

460
00:55:52,075 --> 00:55:53,376
No sirreeee!

461
00:55:53,376 --> 00:55:56,834
Don't you even think about
laying a finger on that chair.

462
00:56:00,383 --> 00:56:03,219
Do you have a name?

463
00:56:03,219 --> 00:56:05,881
l expect you know who l am.

464
00:56:15,098 --> 00:56:18,590
- Liza, can you mail this?
- Sure can.

465
00:56:52,836 --> 00:56:54,804
May l help you?

466
00:56:56,739 --> 00:57:02,412
l expect you know who l am,
so there's no need for introduction.

467
00:57:02,412 --> 00:57:07,183
Quite the contrary, sir. l
have no idea who you are.

468
00:57:07,183 --> 00:57:16,558
Ah, well who l am is who l'm gonna be, and who
l'm gonna be is Amanda Shaw's Father.

469
00:57:17,527 --> 00:57:20,263
So you've come to claim
your share of the inheritance?

470
00:57:20,263 --> 00:57:24,601
Ah, see. l knew you knew who l was.

471
00:57:24,601 --> 00:57:26,302
What's your name?

472
00:57:26,302 --> 00:57:29,239
Zachary Hughes.

473
00:57:29,239 --> 00:57:32,208
And you're going to be Mandie Shaw's Father?

474
00:57:32,208 --> 00:57:34,043
That's what l said.

475
00:57:34,043 --> 00:57:38,348
But currently you are no
blood relation of Miss Shaw.

476
00:57:38,348 --> 00:57:40,917
Now what does that have to
do with this conversation?

477
00:57:40,917 --> 00:57:46,956
Well l wouldn't want to presume incorrectly
that you're going to marry Mandie's Mother?

478
00:57:46,956 --> 00:57:52,996
Well, you can presume whatever you
want but that's what l plan to do.

479
00:57:52,996 --> 00:57:58,801
And seeing as how Mandie is far too young to
be making wise decisions for herself...

480
00:57:58,801 --> 00:58:03,295
l'll just be taking Mandie and
her inheritance home now.

481
00:58:05,108 --> 00:58:08,645
And how could you not send word of her safety?

482
00:58:08,645 --> 00:58:10,480
Her Momma is fit to be tied with worry.

483
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,041
- Where is the girl?
- What s that terrible smell?

484
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:16,119
Hmmmm?

485
00:58:16,119 --> 00:58:18,721
May l ask how you are employed?

486
00:58:18,721 --> 00:58:25,028
l, sir, am a purveyor of fine scented soaps,
accessories, and other necessities...

487
00:58:25,028 --> 00:58:27,497
- ...for the ladies.
- Ah. Soaps. Yes, of course.

488
00:58:27,497 --> 00:58:29,499
Ah, Mr. Hughes.

489
00:58:29,499 --> 00:58:31,467
Follow me, please.

490
00:58:36,673 --> 00:58:40,677
Mr. Hughes, you have no blood
relationship with Miss Shaw.

491
00:58:40,677 --> 00:58:45,148
Therefore you have no further business
in this house. l bid you good day.

492
00:58:45,148 --> 00:58:48,685
Well, if it's blood ye be wanting,
l'll just come back with her Ma.

493
00:58:48,685 --> 00:58:55,992
lf you ever want to set foot in this house again, l
advise you to find some soap that makes you...

494
00:58:55,992 --> 00:59:00,656
...smell like a man, and then use it!

495
00:59:11,441 --> 00:59:13,776
That man marrying my Momma?

496
00:59:13,776 --> 00:59:15,945
That's what he says.

497
00:59:15,945 --> 00:59:18,581
- Where does your Momma live?
- Charley Gap.

498
00:59:18,581 --> 00:59:24,821
Good. Good. lt'll take Mr. Hughes a
full day to get back to his bathtub.

499
00:59:24,821 --> 00:59:28,985
Now ladies, we have got to find this will.

500
00:59:30,426 --> 00:59:35,557
She wore an antler necklace
to protect the secrets of her heart.

501
00:59:36,366 --> 00:59:42,862
Ahhhh. But the hand-made, far-East treasure
trunks guarded a manner of secrets.

502
01:00:13,369 --> 01:00:15,337
Polly.

503
01:00:15,905 --> 01:00:17,707
ls this him?

504
01:00:17,707 --> 01:00:21,711
He is dapper, exactly how imagined him.

505
01:00:21,711 --> 01:00:24,680
They look alike.

506
01:00:42,699 --> 01:00:46,936
A pity the girls missed such a fine dinner.

507
01:00:46,936 --> 01:00:48,604
Yes, yes it is.

508
01:00:48,604 --> 01:00:54,844
l'm sure that Aunt Lou's cooking is far superior
to anything you're used to, Miss Snow.

509
01:00:54,844 --> 01:00:57,547
As are the accommodations.

510
01:00:57,547 --> 01:01:01,779
Thank you so much for your hospitality.

511
01:01:02,218 --> 01:01:06,856
Now, as to finalzing the details of the
inheritance, l know that often takes time.

512
01:01:06,856 --> 01:01:13,261
We're in no hurry. At least l'm not. Perhaps Mr.
Locke has other pressing business.

513
01:01:14,697 --> 01:01:18,067
Do you have other pressing
business, Mr. Locke?

514
01:01:18,067 --> 01:01:21,730
No, no. This takes precedence.

515
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:36,886
l'm trying a new perspective.

516
01:01:36,886 --> 01:01:41,624
Maybe the will's not even in here.
Maybe it's down those attic stairs.

517
01:01:41,624 --> 01:01:44,184
You're welcome to go look.

518
01:01:55,605 --> 01:01:58,233
What happened?

519
01:01:58,708 --> 01:02:00,676
Thank you.

520
01:02:02,812 --> 01:02:06,771
Nigh inseparable, these two.

521
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:12,178
Best friends, you know, even though John
was fifteen years older than your Daddy.

522
01:02:13,456 --> 01:02:18,393
And stubborn fools, both of them.

523
01:02:20,163 --> 01:02:23,199
Fell in love with the same woman...

524
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:27,403
...fought over her something terrible.

525
01:02:27,403 --> 01:02:30,339
And parted ways.

526
01:02:30,339 --> 01:02:33,376
All for nothing. They both lost her.

527
01:02:33,376 --> 01:02:35,912
l suppose that f...

528
01:02:35,912 --> 01:02:42,218
lf all of us had realized the rift
was forever, that we would have...

529
01:02:42,218 --> 01:02:45,415
...handled ourselves a little differently.

530
01:02:47,423 --> 01:02:54,697
Miss Mandie, do you know what them brothers
loved doing together more than anything?

531
01:02:54,697 --> 01:02:56,365
What?

532
01:02:56,365 --> 01:02:58,201
Making music.

533
01:02:58,201 --> 01:03:03,195
Yes ma'am, and this here house done been
deprived of joyful noise for too long.

534
01:03:05,541 --> 01:03:10,146
lt was a mark of honor to be invited to
the Shaw mansion to hear the brothers play....

535
01:03:10,146 --> 01:03:13,382
...the organ or the fiddle or the banjo.

536
01:03:13,382 --> 01:03:18,843
And Mr. Jason here, well, he taught
'em everything they knew.

537
01:03:32,101 --> 01:03:35,504
Brightly beams our Father's mercy...

538
01:03:35,504 --> 01:03:39,175
...from his lighthouse evermore.

539
01:03:39,175 --> 01:03:43,045
But to us, He gives the keeping...

540
01:03:43,045 --> 01:03:46,749
...of the lights along the shore.

541
01:03:46,749 --> 01:03:50,519
Let the towerlights keep burning...

542
01:03:50,519 --> 01:03:54,523
...send a gleam across the wave.

543
01:03:54,523 --> 01:03:58,194
Some poor struggling, sinking sailor...

544
01:03:58,194 --> 01:04:02,131
...you may rescue, you may save.

545
01:04:02,131 --> 01:04:06,202
Dark the night, the sin has settled...

546
01:04:06,202 --> 01:04:09,805
...loud the angry billows roar.

547
01:04:09,805 --> 01:04:13,409
Eager eyes are watching, longing...

548
01:04:13,409 --> 01:04:17,013
...for the lights along the shore.

549
01:04:17,013 --> 01:04:21,017
Let the towerlights keep burning.

550
01:04:21,017 --> 01:04:24,654
Send a gleam across the wave.

551
01:04:24,654 --> 01:04:28,491
Eager eyes are watching, longing...

552
01:04:28,491 --> 01:04:33,087
...for the lights along the shore.

553
01:04:59,588 --> 01:05:02,491
The free hotel is full.

554
01:05:02,491 --> 01:05:05,187
And the food is all ate up.

555
01:05:11,767 --> 01:05:13,735
JOE!

556
01:05:15,671 --> 01:05:17,606
Hi Doctor Woodard.

557
01:05:17,606 --> 01:05:19,508
Good to see you Mandie.

558
01:05:19,508 --> 01:05:21,811
Joe said that he -

559
01:05:21,811 --> 01:05:25,406
- that you missed him something terrible.

560
01:05:25,815 --> 01:05:32,050
ls it alright if he stays here for the next few
nights while l visit patients down the mountain?

561
01:05:32,688 --> 01:05:34,656
Liza?

562
01:05:35,558 --> 01:05:38,761
We can put him in the nursery.

563
01:05:38,761 --> 01:05:43,494
- Let's go show him the creek!
- Maybe we'll find some crawdads.

564
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,469
- l never saw a creek -
- Whisper!

565
01:05:46,469 --> 01:05:50,306
l never saw a creek you had to go
upstairs in your house to get to.

566
01:05:50,306 --> 01:05:53,009
l'm Polly Cornwalls.

567
01:05:53,009 --> 01:05:54,577
Joe.

568
01:05:54,577 --> 01:05:56,977
Are you brave?

569
01:05:58,381 --> 01:06:00,815
'Course.

570
01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:29,745
You first.

571
01:06:29,745 --> 01:06:31,713
Me?

572
01:07:15,891 --> 01:07:21,664
Whispers say that the lndian Princess and her
pregnant sister were given shelter...

573
01:07:21,664 --> 01:07:27,136
...in a room like a cathedral
with windows so high...

574
01:07:27,136 --> 01:07:30,539
...only eagles could see through.

575
01:07:30,539 --> 01:07:33,175
Many Cherokee people lived together...

576
01:07:33,175 --> 01:07:39,448
...in this hidden room, tucked away inside the
walls of a great mansion.

577
01:07:39,448 --> 01:07:45,488
The white archer, young though he was, built the
room with his own two hands...

578
01:07:45,488 --> 01:07:50,392
...to provide refuge for his Cherokee friends.

579
01:07:50,392 --> 01:07:56,031
They lived as normally as they could.

580
01:07:56,031 --> 01:08:05,804
The men cleaned their rifles, sharpened blades,
and tanned the hides they shot by moonlight.

581
01:08:08,377 --> 01:08:12,281
The women sewed and beaded, wove baskets...

582
01:08:12,281 --> 01:08:18,821
...and cooked in the greatest
fireplace Talitha had ever seen.

583
01:08:18,821 --> 01:08:22,458
But her favorite thing about the cathedral room...

584
01:08:22,458 --> 01:08:29,125
...was the set of antlers carved from the head of
the white archer's smelly, dead deer.

585
01:08:42,244 --> 01:08:45,948
Daddy told me the story a thousand times.

586
01:08:45,948 --> 01:08:48,212
He never said it was real.

587
01:08:59,061 --> 01:09:03,766
Talitha clothed her nephew papoose
in fabric her Mother had made...

588
01:09:03,766 --> 01:09:07,436
...dyed from the juice of a chokeberry.

589
01:09:07,436 --> 01:09:12,374
Fifty Cherokee escaped the trail of tears,
and hid in here for four years...

590
01:09:12,374 --> 01:09:14,810
...never seeing the light of day.

591
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:18,280
lf the army had found out, they
would have killed your Grandpa...

592
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,182
...and everybody in here!

593
01:09:20,182 --> 01:09:23,385
Nobody ever found out.

594
01:09:23,385 --> 01:09:29,483
My Grandpa was in the army.
He hated lndian overs.

595
01:09:30,659 --> 01:09:34,029
Talitha's family was never seen again.

596
01:09:34,029 --> 01:09:38,567
So she and the white archer
started their own family.

597
01:09:38,567 --> 01:09:43,436
And promised never to separate, even for a day.

598
01:09:49,712 --> 01:09:52,180
l think l'm an lndian.

599
01:10:46,335 --> 01:10:49,702
l told you we were going to the creek.

600
01:10:50,973 --> 01:10:53,942
Now where do you think the will is?

601
01:10:53,942 --> 01:10:56,274
l don't know.

602
01:11:02,284 --> 01:11:06,220
What ya looking for?

603
01:11:08,924 --> 01:11:10,426
A crawdad.

604
01:11:10,426 --> 01:11:14,294
- Come touch it.
- He won't pinch you. l promise.

605
01:11:26,075 --> 01:11:29,345
Next time you're late, you' be skipping dinner.

606
01:11:29,345 --> 01:11:31,647
Sorry Liza. We - uh -

607
01:11:31,647 --> 01:11:34,149
- Searched and searched all day long, and...

608
01:11:34,149 --> 01:11:37,519
...finally found a crawdad.

609
01:11:37,519 --> 01:11:40,322
But Polly won't touch it.

610
01:11:40,322 --> 01:35:07,626
- Will you?
- No.

611
01:11:45,928 --> 01:11:51,457
l'm quite sure you simply poured
water on yourselves, in the bathroom.

612
01:11:51,967 --> 01:11:54,336
Oh did we?

613
01:11:54,336 --> 01:11:57,863
They're delcious to eat. Especially raw.

614
01:11:59,708 --> 01:12:02,811
A true delicatessen.

615
01:12:02,811 --> 01:12:06,815
Oh, my! You've got yourself a real keeper!

616
01:12:06,815 --> 01:12:11,019
Well l have never in my life seen one this big!

617
01:12:11,019 --> 01:12:13,322
Well she's older than you are!

618
01:12:13,322 --> 01:12:17,782
Honey, you can't get a good
look at it unless you're holding it.

619
01:12:18,961 --> 01:12:20,758
OW!

620
01:12:21,530 --> 01:12:26,201
l do have some more rooms, but they's
much too much trouble to make up.

621
01:12:26,201 --> 01:12:28,169
lt's precious.

622
01:12:28,804 --> 01:12:30,772
Aw.

623
01:12:38,514 --> 01:12:41,881
Joe, l'm glad you came.

624
01:12:45,654 --> 01:12:49,522
Joe is adorable.

625
01:12:52,561 --> 01:12:54,830
- l'll be back after a while.
- Where ya going?

626
01:12:54,830 --> 01:12:56,058
- l'll be back after a while.
- Where ya going?

627
01:13:06,608 --> 01:13:09,509
l hear Uncle John dead.

628
01:13:11,213 --> 01:13:13,545
Am sorry, Papoose.

629
01:13:19,788 --> 01:13:23,525
How come Daddy never told me
Talitha Pindar was his Mother?

630
01:13:23,525 --> 01:13:25,260
Protect Papoose.

631
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:26,628
From what?

632
01:13:26,628 --> 01:13:31,793
Broke heart. Many people no like lndians.

633
01:13:36,071 --> 01:13:38,073
She's really my Grandmother?

634
01:13:38,073 --> 01:13:42,177
Why think l call you Papoose,
and give necklace?

635
01:13:42,177 --> 01:13:44,246
You never told me?

636
01:13:44,246 --> 01:13:47,616
Promise Jim, no tell.

637
01:13:47,616 --> 01:13:51,553
All this time, nobody ever told me!

638
01:13:51,553 --> 01:13:54,818
To protect Papoose heart.

639
01:13:57,192 --> 01:14:02,391
Ya'll failed. lt broke.

640
01:14:05,501 --> 01:14:11,701
Would have been a lot easier to find out
when l first asked Daddy for the truth.

641
01:14:14,776 --> 01:14:17,713
Can you stay close by until we find the will?

642
01:14:17,713 --> 01:14:21,917
l keep Papoose safe. Always.

643
01:14:21,917 --> 01:14:25,654
Promise Jim long ago.

644
01:14:25,654 --> 01:14:28,987
Promise Papoose now.

645
01:15:06,161 --> 01:15:09,831
l'm taking my daughter home.

646
01:15:09,831 --> 01:15:14,002
- Who are you, Madam?
- Don't you sass me. Where's my girl?

647
01:15:14,002 --> 01:15:17,839
Madam, l've never seen you before in my life.
How would l know who your little girl is?

648
01:15:17,839 --> 01:15:22,242
You know full well who l am. l'm Etta Shaw.

649
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:29,418
Well, well this is surprising.

650
01:15:29,418 --> 01:15:32,988
You're both smelling very appropriate today.

651
01:15:32,988 --> 01:15:36,892
Don't play games with me. You're gonna
take me to my Amanda this minute.

652
01:15:36,892 --> 01:15:39,061
Or l'll go get the sheriff this minute.

653
01:15:39,061 --> 01:15:43,298
We l'm afraid this minute, Miss
Amanda's whereabouts are not known.

654
01:15:43,298 --> 01:15:47,102
- lf you've gone and lost my little girl -
- Of course l haven't lost your little girl...

655
01:15:47,102 --> 01:15:51,273
...that would be irresponsible. Wouldn't that be
irresponsible? Of course it would. Yes.

656
01:15:51,273 --> 01:15:55,077
She could be down by the creek, she
could be riding a horse, she could be...

657
01:15:55,077 --> 01:15:57,179
...in any number of trees.

658
01:15:57,179 --> 01:16:00,382
Uh-huh. Why isn't she helping
around the house?

659
01:16:00,382 --> 01:16:06,548
Well l think that she needs a little
variety in her life, wouldn't you say?

660
01:16:07,089 --> 01:16:09,958
We'll stay for supper.

661
01:16:09,958 --> 01:16:12,494
- Ah.
- Surely she'll be back by then?

662
01:16:12,494 --> 01:16:14,086
Surely, Madam.

663
01:16:17,232 --> 01:16:19,334
Sshhhhhhh!

664
01:16:19,334 --> 01:16:22,070
Mrs. Etta Shaw has arrived.

665
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:23,205
-No!
- lt's okay.

666
01:16:23,205 --> 01:16:25,540
- Don't panic, don't panic.
- No, no!

667
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:28,744
We'll go downstairs, we'll
have some early supper.

668
01:16:28,744 --> 01:16:33,181
We'll come back up here and
we' search all night if necessary.

669
01:16:33,181 --> 01:16:35,149
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

670
01:16:40,856 --> 01:16:42,824
There she is!

671
01:16:46,294 --> 01:16:48,563
Do you know how worried l was?

672
01:16:48,563 --> 01:16:53,168
You know what you put me through? l had
search parties out for three days.

673
01:16:53,168 --> 01:16:56,296
How could you not send word?

674
01:16:57,205 --> 01:16:59,274
l missed you so much.

675
01:16:59,274 --> 01:17:01,943
Would you have missed me when
you hired me out for work too?

676
01:17:01,943 --> 01:17:07,749
Mandie! l don't - l don't hire
my family out. l love my family.

677
01:17:07,749 --> 01:17:11,653
Thank you for taking such good care of her.

678
01:17:11,653 --> 01:17:15,924
And look at this pretty new dress!

679
01:17:15,924 --> 01:17:20,657
l always wished l could afford to make her one.

680
01:17:25,033 --> 01:17:28,662
l wish l had family like that.

681
01:17:35,143 --> 01:17:38,613
Your lnjun friend put a right
ugly hole in my saddle.

682
01:17:38,613 --> 01:17:42,447
Hush Mr. Hughes. That's been forgiven.

683
01:17:43,018 --> 01:17:48,056
Who improperly set my place? l have
nothing with which to eat my dinner.

684
01:17:48,056 --> 01:17:52,894
Miss Snow, l'm sure you can find a way to get
them green beans down your gullet...

685
01:17:52,894 --> 01:17:54,862
...with a salad fork.

686
01:17:56,331 --> 01:18:01,036
We'll be leaving right after dinner so as
not to cause you any more trouble.

687
01:18:01,036 --> 01:18:04,039
l know Amanda's homesick.

688
01:18:04,039 --> 01:18:08,443
Well, ah, you're certainly welcome
to spend the night.

689
01:18:08,443 --> 01:18:11,012
l mean, we have plenty of rooms.

690
01:18:11,012 --> 01:18:13,815
Well, we've a ready left lrene way too long.

691
01:18:13,815 --> 01:18:17,216
But thank you for your hospitality.

692
01:18:17,719 --> 01:18:21,456
Oh pity.

693
01:18:21,456 --> 01:18:27,417
This house will feel so empty
and quiet without you kids.

694
01:18:33,935 --> 01:18:37,472
Mr. Hughes, your wheel clean
fell off of your wagon.

695
01:18:37,472 --> 01:18:41,670
But don't worry. l can have it fixed by midnight.

696
01:18:45,847 --> 01:18:48,907
Liza, would you prepare
two more rooms?

697
01:18:49,818 --> 01:18:51,786
Yes, sir.

698
01:18:56,591 --> 01:19:00,629
Land sakes child, quit your whining and sit still.

699
01:19:00,629 --> 01:19:06,261
l can't rub your head with you wiggling
every which way, l'll for sure miss a spot.

700
01:19:13,208 --> 01:19:16,545
Have the bedrooms on this floor been checked?

701
01:19:16,545 --> 01:19:18,380
On this floor, no.

702
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:20,549
What about downstairs where the lndians lived?

703
01:19:20,549 --> 01:19:23,118
Well, to my knowledge, Mr. John
never went down there.

704
01:19:23,118 --> 01:19:25,587
What if he did without your knowledge?

705
01:19:25,587 --> 01:19:28,556
You're right, we should be thorough.

706
01:19:38,533 --> 01:19:41,636
- Hurry up!
- l am

707
01:19:41,636 --> 01:19:43,471
Ssshhhhh!

708
01:19:43,471 --> 01:19:45,439
l know l done gotta be quiet.

709
01:19:49,711 --> 01:19:51,679
Look at this.

710
01:19:53,248 --> 01:19:56,308
l'd fight with my brother over her.

711
01:19:56,885 --> 01:19:59,487
Do you think this is her?

712
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:01,990
Must have died young.

713
01:20:01,990 --> 01:20:04,481
Oh how terribly tragic.

714
01:20:49,104 --> 01:20:51,373
My Father's probably not even in the will.

715
01:20:51,373 --> 01:20:55,139
Hush. Lay down here and think like Mr. John.

716
01:20:55,810 --> 01:20:59,268
We all need new perspectives.

717
01:21:35,850 --> 01:21:38,920
lt's the same picture.

718
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:42,321
l bet the other half is hiding underneath.

719
01:21:46,728 --> 01:21:50,231
How's the little angel sleeping?

720
01:21:50,231 --> 01:21:52,199
Pretty sound, eh?

721
01:21:53,935 --> 01:21:55,903
Meow.

722
01:21:57,472 --> 01:21:59,963
No, you ain't going.

723
01:22:03,511 --> 01:22:08,380
Wake up angel. Morning's
coming early, we're going home.

724
01:22:10,185 --> 01:22:12,653
Alright, you asked for it.

725
01:22:43,485 --> 01:22:47,689
A man having a picture of him and
his brother in a locket is strange.

726
01:22:47,689 --> 01:22:49,624
lt's sweet.

727
01:22:49,624 --> 01:22:52,694
Ya'll, we're sidetracked.

728
01:22:52,694 --> 01:22:55,697
l don't think so.

729
01:22:55,697 --> 01:22:58,400
l know his brother's underneath.

730
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:03,633
You just can't wear a lopsided locket.

731
01:23:11,913 --> 01:23:15,349
Finally something that makes sense.

732
01:23:16,751 --> 01:23:19,387
You sure don't look a thing like Etta.

733
01:23:19,387 --> 01:23:23,323
Again, sidetracked. The will.

734
01:23:35,303 --> 01:23:39,574
The treasure trunks guarded secrets,
the antler necklace protected secrets...

735
01:23:39,574 --> 01:23:43,244
...but l already have the antler necklace
and it's not protecting anything.

736
01:23:43,244 --> 01:23:47,215
Maybe we should check the cathedral room.

737
01:23:47,215 --> 01:23:49,183
No!

738
01:24:16,344 --> 01:24:18,312
Open it.

739
01:24:35,964 --> 01:24:39,334
My middle name is Elizabeth.

740
01:24:39,334 --> 01:24:42,871
Ashevie, North Carolina is only
six hours away from here by train.

741
01:24:42,871 --> 01:24:44,105
Yeah.

742
01:24:44,105 --> 01:24:47,199
Polly, she's obviously dead.

743
01:25:13,735 --> 01:25:15,703
Open this door right now children!

744
01:25:17,805 --> 01:25:20,108
They'll do no such thing.

745
01:25:20,108 --> 01:25:24,646
l demand to know what is going on in there.
Open this door right now or l shall break it down!

746
01:25:24,646 --> 01:25:27,448
You' have to get through me first.

747
01:25:27,448 --> 01:25:29,317
Ahhhhh!

748
01:25:29,317 --> 01:25:32,047
- Uncle Ned!
- Papoose

749
01:25:33,788 --> 01:25:36,450
l bring Uncle John.

750
01:25:47,969 --> 01:25:51,673
Etta, l think the sky is falling.

751
01:25:51,673 --> 01:25:55,700
Or maybe they just grow really
big rats around here.

752
01:25:57,045 --> 01:26:00,515
Woman, she ain't in the closet.

753
01:26:00,515 --> 01:26:03,313
l'm going to sleep.

754
01:26:05,019 --> 01:26:09,820
ls the interrupting of my beauty
rest gonna be a nightly occurrence?

755
01:26:15,430 --> 01:26:17,398
Etta.

756
01:26:20,635 --> 01:26:23,137
Are we having a slumber party?

757
01:26:23,137 --> 01:26:25,571
My baby's been kidnapped.

758
01:26:43,391 --> 01:26:45,360
Mr. John.

759
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,851
Jason.

760
01:26:50,265 --> 01:26:51,933
Mr. John.

761
01:26:51,933 --> 01:26:52,228
Mr. John.

762
01:26:53,568 --> 01:26:57,405
l reckon my absence has caused a bit of trouble.

763
01:26:57,405 --> 01:27:03,444
Just a bit, Sir, just a bit.

764
01:27:03,444 --> 01:27:07,540
What in heaven's name are
you doing in my home?

765
01:27:08,182 --> 01:27:13,354
- Mr. Shaw. l - l - l - they said that you -
- l'm not.

766
01:27:13,354 --> 01:27:13,655
- Mr. Shaw. l - l - l - they said that you -
- l'm not.

767
01:27:13,655 --> 01:27:17,147
Fortunately, l know how to swim.

768
01:27:18,526 --> 01:27:23,865
Now l've asked you, Mr. Snow,
what are you doing in my home?

769
01:27:23,865 --> 01:27:26,356
Mr. Snow?

770
01:27:28,102 --> 01:27:32,334
Yes. Did you not properly introduce yourself?

771
01:27:33,174 --> 01:27:34,876
Oh, please sir. l can, l can understand. Oh.
Help, somebody. Sir. Please, Mr. Shaw.

772
01:27:34,876 --> 01:27:39,939
Oh, please sir. l can, l can understand. Oh.
Help, somebody. Sir. Please, Mr. Shaw.

773
01:27:43,685 --> 01:27:45,653
Mandie?

774
01:27:46,187 --> 01:27:48,690
Mandie? Mandie.

775
01:27:48,690 --> 01:27:52,626
Mandie! Mandie? Mandie.

776
01:27:54,962 --> 01:27:56,397
Hello Mrs. Snow.

777
01:27:56,397 --> 01:27:57,665
Hello Mrs. Snow.

778
01:27:57,665 --> 01:27:59,633
l am your nephew.

779
01:28:00,668 --> 01:28:03,501
Ghost! Ghost!

780
01:28:04,472 --> 01:28:06,440
l just wanted to be here.

781
01:28:09,177 --> 01:28:13,739
- What was that?
- A lady screaming.

782
01:28:14,682 --> 01:28:17,583
Like she done seen a ghost!

783
01:28:18,386 --> 01:28:21,583
All right Mr. Hughes, on your feet, Sir.

784
01:28:23,024 --> 01:28:25,159
l don't wanna leave, l just -

785
01:28:25,159 --> 01:28:30,119
We're moving out of here.
Just stay there, we'll be back.

786
01:28:31,132 --> 01:28:34,235
Amanda. Amanda?

787
01:28:34,235 --> 01:28:35,903
Ghost!

788
01:28:35,903 --> 01:28:38,804
Where's a ghost? Who saw a ghost?

789
01:28:39,607 --> 01:28:39,707
-Aaaahhhhhh!
- l'm real, Aunt Lou, not a ghost.

790
01:28:39,707 --> 01:28:42,276
-Aaaahhhhhh!
- l'm real, Aunt Lou, not a ghost.

791
01:28:42,276 --> 01:28:43,978
l promise.

792
01:28:43,978 --> 01:28:45,713
That's what they all say!

793
01:28:45,713 --> 01:28:48,449
My baby! My baby! Oh,
l thought you were killed!

794
01:28:48,449 --> 01:28:52,476
Get off of me! She's not even my real Momma.

795
01:28:54,288 --> 01:28:57,382
Why didn't you tell me?

796
01:28:59,327 --> 01:29:01,229
Honey, it's so obvious.

797
01:29:02,797 --> 01:29:05,027
Neither me nor lrene look a thing like ya.

798
01:29:05,433 --> 01:29:09,704
And the only reason your Father made me
promise not to tell was so you thought you...

799
01:29:09,704 --> 01:29:11,672
...had a real family.

800
01:29:12,707 --> 01:29:15,710
You mean you put me through all this trouble...

801
01:29:15,710 --> 01:29:18,577
...knowing full well she wasn't
your flesh and blood?

802
01:29:23,317 --> 01:29:26,888
Jason would you please escort
Mr. and Mrs. Snow out?

803
01:29:26,888 --> 01:29:29,914
With great pleasure, Sir.
This way.

804
01:29:31,626 --> 01:29:34,493
Well l am not leaving without my things.

805
01:29:35,897 --> 01:29:41,164
And as for my brother's widow and her friend.

806
01:29:42,003 --> 01:29:43,771
l volunteer.

807
01:29:43,771 --> 01:29:44,272
Thank you Liza, Samuel.

808
01:29:44,272 --> 01:29:46,900
Thank you Liza, Samuel.

809
01:29:49,877 --> 01:29:53,005
My brother was married to that woman?

810
01:29:59,020 --> 01:30:01,556
Jason would you help Mrs. Snow carry her bag?

811
01:30:01,556 --> 01:30:04,592
l do hate to see a woman aboring
under such weight.

812
01:30:04,592 --> 01:30:05,793
Yes, of course, Mr. John.

813
01:30:05,793 --> 01:30:06,627
Yes, of course, Mr. John.

814
01:30:06,627 --> 01:30:09,430
- l'll take that.
- No thank you. l'm quite capable.

815
01:30:09,430 --> 01:30:12,433
- l insist.
- No that will not be necessary.

816
01:30:12,433 --> 01:30:14,401
Thank you.

817
01:30:15,536 --> 01:30:22,442
You know, Mrs. Snow, you really
should start learning to pack for travelling.

818
01:30:25,046 --> 01:30:27,014
These are nice.

819
01:30:27,515 --> 01:30:30,507
There's only one rule really.

820
01:30:31,085 --> 01:30:34,384
Don't haul out what you did not haul in.

821
01:30:38,526 --> 01:30:40,027
All right.

822
01:30:40,027 --> 01:30:42,791
Thank you Madam. After you.

823
01:30:47,702 --> 01:30:48,836
Goodbye Mr. and Mrs. Snow.

824
01:30:48,836 --> 01:30:50,804
Goodbye Mr. and Mrs. Snow.

825
01:31:11,526 --> 01:31:16,293
l can't decide whether you look
more like my Mother or Elizabeth.

826
01:31:17,331 --> 01:31:19,600
They told me you were dead.

827
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,235
Who?

828
01:31:21,235 --> 01:31:23,704
Elizabeth's parents.

829
01:31:23,704 --> 01:31:25,273
Why?

830
01:31:25,273 --> 01:31:30,111
For the same reason that they split your Father
and Elizabeth up and annulled their marriage...

831
01:31:30,111 --> 01:31:31,379
...five days after their honeymoon.

832
01:31:31,379 --> 01:31:33,047
...five days after their honeymoon.

833
01:31:33,047 --> 01:31:35,082
They found out we were half Cherokee.

834
01:31:35,082 --> 01:31:40,384
And they were not about to let lndian blood
dilute their pure German ancestry.

835
01:31:42,690 --> 01:31:46,854
l with Jim Shaw. Messenger come.

836
01:31:47,194 --> 01:31:49,754
Bring baby.
You.

837
01:31:50,598 --> 01:31:52,900
Messenger say Elizabeth dead in childbirth.

838
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:54,800
Messenger say Elizabeth dead in childbirth.

839
01:31:55,536 --> 01:31:58,198
Give you to Jim Shaw.

840
01:31:58,806 --> 01:32:02,435
You knew this whole time that
Etta wasn't my real mother?

841
01:32:02,810 --> 01:32:05,438
Am sorry, Papoose.

842
01:32:07,548 --> 01:32:11,218
How do you go fourteen years and never make
up with the only brother you had?

843
01:32:11,218 --> 01:32:14,381
l thought he would come back
after his marriage was annulled.

844
01:32:15,156 --> 01:32:17,124
So l waited.

845
01:32:18,859 --> 01:32:23,097
He was the one who left - he
took Elizabeth and Ned.

846
01:32:23,097 --> 01:32:26,233
l didn't know where he went.

847
01:32:26,233 --> 01:32:28,201
So l waited.

848
01:32:29,303 --> 01:32:31,271
Too long.

849
01:32:33,541 --> 01:32:35,943
Father would have listened to you if
you would have told him to come back.

850
01:32:35,943 --> 01:32:37,342
Father would have listened to you if
you would have told him to come back.

851
01:32:40,648 --> 01:32:43,284
What happened to Elizabeth?

852
01:32:43,284 --> 01:32:46,845
l don't know. l didn't want to know.

853
01:32:47,989 --> 01:32:51,550
Jim was proud of his lndian blood.

854
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:57,397
l told him to hideit, that it'd get him in trouble.

855
01:32:59,667 --> 01:33:02,363
He didn't listen to me.

856
01:33:05,506 --> 01:33:09,306
l don't know if l'm proud of
my lndian blood or not.

857
01:33:11,245 --> 01:33:14,112
l'm glad you're not dead.

858
01:33:29,230 --> 01:33:33,100
How long did it take you to clean up this place?

859
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:35,169
Don't ask.

860
01:33:35,169 --> 01:33:37,738
Mr. Shaw, where is your will?

861
01:33:37,738 --> 01:33:39,640
Can you keep a secret?

862
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:40,641
Yes.
Sure.

863
01:33:40,641 --> 01:33:41,972
Yes.
Sure.

864
01:33:44,712 --> 01:33:46,680
No.

865
01:33:56,791 --> 01:33:58,759
Jumpin' Jiminey.

866
01:34:33,394 --> 01:34:35,362
Of all the places.

867
01:34:54,749 --> 01:34:57,785
Why would anyone hide a
will where no-one can find it?

868
01:34:57,785 --> 01:35:01,221
To know that, you would have to break the seal.

869
01:35:28,449 --> 01:35:31,213
l don't wanna be mad anymore!

870
01:35:36,657 --> 01:35:38,625
Miss Mandie!

871
01:36:28,242 --> 01:36:31,946
lf that ain't the prettiest dress this side
of the Mississippi, l don't know what is.

872
01:36:31,946 --> 01:36:32,646
Oh, 'Chile, hush up now.

873
01:36:32,646 --> 01:36:34,409
Oh, 'Chile, hush up now.

874
01:36:46,727 --> 01:36:48,695
We sailed to.

875
01:36:51,232 --> 01:36:53,200
Bad weather hit us.

876
01:36:55,536 --> 01:36:57,404
Five of us swam to.

877
01:36:57,404 --> 01:37:01,602
Cape Hatteras, where you lived in
a lighthouse for a whole weak.

878
01:37:03,577 --> 01:37:06,714
Are there crawdads in the ocean?

879
01:37:06,714 --> 01:37:11,777
Excuse me. Miss Mandie's new
dress is ready. She'll be a sight to see.

880
01:37:29,169 --> 01:37:32,536
Never knew it could take so
long to put on a dress.

881
01:38:16,817 --> 01:38:20,120
Liza, if that's a stranger, don't open the door.

882
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:20,621
Liza, if that's a stranger, don't open the door.

883
01:38:20,621 --> 01:38:24,022
We'll endure the ringing until they go away.

884
01:38:25,526 --> 01:38:27,494
Who is it?

885
01:38:33,667 --> 01:38:35,726
Summon Miss Mandie and Mr. John.
