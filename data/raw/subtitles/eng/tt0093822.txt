1
00:00:20,973 --> 00:00:22,884
My name is HIMcDunnough.

2
00:00:26,173 --> 00:00:28,164
Call me Hi.

3
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:33,811
The first time lmetEd was in
the countylockup in Tempe, Arizona.

4
00:00:35,293 --> 00:00:38,171
- Don't forget his profile, Ed!
- Turn to the right!

5
00:00:38,253 --> 00:00:40,244
A dayl'llneverforget.

6
00:00:41,293 --> 00:00:42,692
Turn to the right!

7
00:00:42,773 --> 00:00:45,492
What kind of name is that
for a pretty thing like you?

8
00:00:45,573 --> 00:00:47,723
Short for Edwina. Turn to the right!

9
00:00:47,813 --> 00:00:52,125
You're a flower, you are.
Just a little desert flower.

10
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:56,247
Let me know how those come out.

11
00:00:56,333 --> 00:01:01,088
Now, prison life is verystructured...
more than mostpeople care for.

12
00:01:01,173 --> 00:01:04,131
But a spirit ofcomradery
exists between the men

13
00:01:04,213 --> 00:01:06,568
Iike you find only in combat, maybe,

14
00:01:06,653 --> 00:01:09,690
or on a pro ball club
in the heat ofthe pennant drive.

15
00:01:11,893 --> 00:01:15,249
In an effort to better ourselves,
we had to meet with a counsellor,

16
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:19,212
who tried to help us figure out
why we were the way we were.

17
00:01:19,293 --> 00:01:22,285
And all Pancho wanted
was a hot roll and butter.

18
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:26,446
So... why do you use the word "trapped"?

19
00:01:26,893 --> 00:01:30,010
- Huh?
- Why do you say you feel "trapped"

20
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:32,969
in a man's body?

21
00:01:33,053 --> 00:01:36,489
Well, sometimes I get
the menstrual cramps real hard.

22
00:01:36,813 --> 00:01:40,169
- Have you learned anything, Hi?
- Yes, sir. You bet.

23
00:01:40,253 --> 00:01:44,565
- You wouldn't lie to us, would you, Hi?
- No, ma'am, hope to say.

24
00:01:44,653 --> 00:01:45,802
OK, then.

25
00:01:46,493 --> 00:01:48,927
I tried to stand up andflystraight,

26
00:01:49,013 --> 00:01:53,609
but it wasn't easy with that
son ofa bitch Reagan in the White House.

27
00:01:54,653 --> 00:01:58,407
I don'tknow. Theysayhe's a decentman.

28
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:02,168
So... maybe his advisors are confused.

29
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:07,768
Turn to the right.

30
00:02:08,813 --> 00:02:11,008
What's the matter, Ed?

31
00:02:12,253 --> 00:02:15,450
- My fiance left me.
- She saidherfiancÃ© hadrun off

32
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:19,811
with a student cosmetologist
who knewhow to plyherfeminine wiles.

33
00:02:19,893 --> 00:02:24,364
- The son of a bitch.
- Don't forget his phone call, Ed!

34
00:02:24,453 --> 00:02:27,968
Tell him I think he's a damn fool, Ed.

35
00:02:28,613 --> 00:02:32,652
You tell him I said so, H I McDunnough.

36
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:36,006
And if he wants to discuss it,
he knows where to find me.

37
00:02:36,093 --> 00:02:39,608
The Maricopa County maximum security
correctional facility for men,

38
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:44,244
State Farm Road, No.31,
Tempe, Arizona. I'll be waitin'!

39
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:46,571
I'll be waitin'.

40
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:51,603
I can'tsayl was happy to be back inside,

41
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:57,689
but the flood offamiliarsights, sounds and
faces almostmade itfeellike a homecomin'.

42
00:02:57,813 --> 00:03:00,885
Most men your age are getting married
and raising up a family.

43
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:05,251
- Well, factually...
- They wouldn't accept prison as a substitute.

44
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,483
Would any ofyou men care to comment?

45
00:03:07,573 --> 00:03:11,566
Well, sometimes your career's
gotta come before family.

46
00:03:12,093 --> 00:03:13,731
Work's what's kept us happy.

47
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:17,483
I tried to sort through
what Doc Schwartz hadsaid,

48
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:20,246
but prison ain't the easiestplace to think.

49
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,484
And when there was no meat, we ate fowl.

50
00:03:23,573 --> 00:03:26,485
And when there was no fowl, we ate crawdad.

51
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:29,770
And when there was no crawdad
to be found, we ate san'.

52
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:32,048
- You ate what?
- We ate san'.

53
00:03:32,653 --> 00:03:35,121
- You ate sand?
- That's right.

54
00:03:35,213 --> 00:03:37,681
Well, Hi, you done served your 20 months.

55
00:03:37,773 --> 00:03:42,801
And seein' as how you never use live ammo,
we got no choice but to return you to society.

56
00:03:42,893 --> 00:03:47,489
- These doors are gonna swing wide.
- I didn't wanna hurt anyone, sir.

57
00:03:47,573 --> 00:03:50,770
- Hi, we respect that.
- But you're just hurting yourself

58
00:03:50,853 --> 00:03:54,562
- with this rambunctious behaviour.
- I know that, sir.

59
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:55,802
OK, then.

60
00:03:55,893 --> 00:03:59,169
I don'tknowhowyou come down
on the incarceration question,

61
00:03:59,253 --> 00:04:02,165
whether it's forrehabilitation orrevenge,

62
00:04:02,253 --> 00:04:06,212
but I was beginning to think revenge
is the onlyargumentmakes anysense.

63
00:04:09,413 --> 00:04:11,483
Show the tattoo!

64
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:16,292
- Turn to the right!
- Don't forget his fingers, Ed.

65
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:21,128
Hear about the paddy wagon
collided with the cement mixer, Ed?

66
00:04:21,213 --> 00:04:23,852
Twelve hardened criminals escaped.

67
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:26,282
I heard that one.

68
00:04:26,373 --> 00:04:29,365
- Got a new beau?
- No, Hi, I sure don't.

69
00:04:30,973 --> 00:04:33,407
Don't worry, I paid for it.

70
00:04:33,493 --> 00:04:37,486
They say thatabsence
makes the heartgrowfonder.

71
00:04:37,573 --> 00:04:39,529
And, for once, theymaybe right.

72
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,569
You missed a spot.

73
00:04:41,653 --> 00:04:44,645
More andmore my thoughts turned to Ed

74
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:48,203
and lfinally felt the pain ofimprisonment.

75
00:04:48,293 --> 00:04:52,206
Mama would throw the live crawdad
in a pan of boilin' water.

76
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:55,603
Well, one day I decided
to make my own crawdad.

77
00:04:55,693 --> 00:04:59,732
And I threw it in a pot,
without the water, you see?

78
00:04:59,813 --> 00:05:03,283
And it was just like makin' popcorn, you see?

79
00:05:03,373 --> 00:05:07,605
Yeah, thejoint's a lonelyplace
after lockup andlights out,

80
00:05:07,693 --> 00:05:11,208
when the last ofthe cons
has been sweptawayby the sandman.

81
00:05:12,053 --> 00:05:17,173
But I couldn'thelp thinkin'
that a brighterfuture layahead.

82
00:05:17,253 --> 00:05:21,246
A future that was only
eight to fourteen months away.

83
00:05:25,773 --> 00:05:28,731
They got a name for people like you, Hi.

84
00:05:28,813 --> 00:05:33,125
- That name is called "recidivism".
- Repeat offender!

85
00:05:33,213 --> 00:05:37,206
- Not a pretty name, is it, Hi?
- No, sir. That's one bonehead name.

86
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:40,842
- But that ain't me any more.
- Are you just tellin' us what we wanna hear?

87
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:44,767
- No, sir, no way.
- Cos we just wanna hear the truth.

88
00:05:44,853 --> 00:05:47,925
Well, then I guess I am
tellin' you what you wanna hear.

89
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:51,926
- Boy, didn't we just tell you not to do that?
- Yes, sir.

90
00:05:52,013 --> 00:05:53,332
OK, then.

91
00:05:54,173 --> 00:05:56,084
Turn to the right!

92
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:59,768
I'm walkin' in here on my knees,
Ed, a free man, proposin'.

93
00:05:59,853 --> 00:06:01,047
Howdy, Curt.

94
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:04,409
- Andso it was.
- Don't forget the bouquet, Ed!

95
00:06:05,453 --> 00:06:07,648
- I do.
- You bet I do.

96
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:08,724
OK, then.

97
00:06:13,253 --> 00:06:16,768
Ed's pa staked us to a starterhome
in suburban Tempe

98
00:06:16,853 --> 00:06:19,413
and lgotajob drillin'holes in sheetmetal.

99
00:06:19,493 --> 00:06:23,202
So we were doin' paramedical work
with the state highway system.

100
00:06:23,293 --> 00:06:27,889
Not actually practisin', you understand.
Me and Bill's patrollin' down Nine Mile...

101
00:06:27,973 --> 00:06:32,569
- Bill Roberts?
- No, not that mother-scratcher. Bill Parker.

102
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:34,848
Anyway, we're approachin' the wreck

103
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:38,892
and there's this spherical object
restin' in the highway.

104
00:06:38,973 --> 00:06:40,929
And it's not a piece o' the car.

105
00:06:41,013 --> 00:06:44,722
Most ways, thejob was a lotlike prison,

106
00:06:44,813 --> 00:06:49,329
except Ed was waitin'at the end ofevery day
and a pay cheque at the end ofevery week.

107
00:06:49,413 --> 00:06:52,132
Government do take a bite, don't she?

108
00:06:53,173 --> 00:06:57,371
These were the happy days,
the salad days, as theysay,

109
00:06:57,453 --> 00:07:01,412
and Edfelt thathavin'a critter
was the nextlogicalstep.

110
00:07:01,493 --> 00:07:03,848
It was allshe thoughtabout.

111
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:08,961
Her point was that there was too much
love andbeautyforjust the two ofus.

112
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:14,844
Every day we kepta child out ofthe world
was a dayhe mightlaterregrethavin'missed.

113
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:18,325
That was beautiful.

114
00:07:18,413 --> 00:07:22,964
So we workedatit on the days
we calculatedmostlikely to be fruitful.

115
00:07:23,053 --> 00:07:26,568
And we workedatit
most other days,just to be sure.

116
00:07:26,653 --> 00:07:32,967
Ed rejoiced thatmylawless years were behind
me and that our child-rearingyears layahead.

117
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:35,248
And then the roofcavedin.

118
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:43,929
Hi... I'm barren!

119
00:07:45,013 --> 00:07:47,004
At firstl didn'tbelieve it.

120
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:53,248
That this woman, who lookedas fertile as
the Tennessee valley, couldnotbear children.

121
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,609
But the doctor explained that
her insides were a rockyplace

122
00:07:56,693 --> 00:07:59,287
where myseed couldfindno purchase.

123
00:08:01,653 --> 00:08:03,848
Ed was inconsolable.

124
00:08:05,013 --> 00:08:07,402
We triedan adoption agency.

125
00:08:08,373 --> 00:08:11,092
It's true that Hi has had a chequered past.

126
00:08:11,173 --> 00:08:16,531
But Ed here is an officer ofthe law twice
decorated, so we figure it kinda evens out.

127
00:08:19,773 --> 00:08:24,972
But biologyand the prejudices ofothers
conspired to keep us childless.

128
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:30,763
Our love for each other
was stronger than ever.

129
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:34,687
But lpreminisced...
no return ofthe salad days.

130
00:08:35,653 --> 00:08:38,531
The pizzazz hadgone out ofourlives.

131
00:08:39,013 --> 00:08:43,609
Ed lostall interestin both
criminaljustice andhousekeepin'.

132
00:08:44,653 --> 00:08:47,531
Soon after, she tenderedherbadge.

133
00:08:48,773 --> 00:08:52,652
Even myjob seemedas dry
and bitteras a hotprairie wind.

134
00:08:53,253 --> 00:08:57,769
So here's Bill, walkin' down Nine Mile...
That's Bill Parker, you understand.

135
00:08:57,853 --> 00:09:02,643
He's got his sandwich in one hand
and a fuckin' head in the other!

136
00:09:05,693 --> 00:09:09,572
I even caughtmyself
drivin' by convenience stores

137
00:09:10,373 --> 00:09:12,762
that weren't on the wayhome.

138
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:19,047
Then one day, the biggestnews hit
the state since theybuilt the HooverDam.

139
00:09:21,493 --> 00:09:24,212
The Arizona quints was born.

140
00:09:24,293 --> 00:09:30,687
By "Arizona quints"Imean they was
born to a woman namedFlorence Arizona.

141
00:09:31,693 --> 00:09:37,165
As youprobablyguessed, Florence Arizona
is the wife ofNathan Arizona.

142
00:09:37,253 --> 00:09:39,847
And Nathan Arizona... Well, hell,

143
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:41,932
you know who he is.

144
00:09:42,013 --> 00:09:45,244
So come on down to UnpaintedArizona

145
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:48,530
to get the finestselection
in fixtures andappointments

146
00:09:48,613 --> 00:09:51,207
for yourbathroom, bedroom, boudoir.

147
00:09:51,293 --> 00:09:56,367
And ifyou can findlowerprices anywhere,
my name ain'tNathan Arizona!

148
00:09:56,453 --> 00:09:59,286
Owner ofthe largest chain
of unpaintedfurniture

149
00:09:59,373 --> 00:10:03,207
and bathroom fixture
outlets throughout the Southwest.

150
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:08,731
Yep, Florence hadbeen takin'fertilitypills
and she andNathan hadhit thejackpot.

151
00:10:11,213 --> 00:10:15,889
Now, y'all withoutsin can cast the firststone.

152
00:10:16,973 --> 00:10:19,692
We thoughtit was unfair
some shouldhave so many

153
00:10:19,773 --> 00:10:22,162
while others shouldhave so few.

154
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:27,924
With the benefit ofhindsight,
maybe it wasn'tsuch a hotidea.

155
00:10:29,453 --> 00:10:34,846
But, at the time, Ed's little plan seemed
like the solution to all ourproblems

156
00:10:35,973 --> 00:10:38,441
and the answer to all ourprayers.

157
00:11:10,573 --> 00:11:13,645
800 leaftables and no chairs?

158
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:16,247
You can't sell leaftables and no chairs.

159
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:19,484
Chairs, you got a dinette set.
No chairs, you got dick!

160
00:11:19,573 --> 00:11:21,450
I ask my wife, she got more sense.

161
00:11:23,453 --> 00:11:27,492
Miles, alls I know is I'm away from the office
for a few days to play with my kids

162
00:11:27,573 --> 00:11:30,770
and everything goes
straight to heck! I won't stand for it!

163
00:11:32,853 --> 00:11:38,769
If a frog had wings, it wouldn't bump its ass
a-hoppin'. I am sick ofyour excuses, Miles!

164
00:11:38,853 --> 00:11:43,165
It is now precisely... 8.45 in the PM.

165
00:11:43,773 --> 00:11:48,324
I'm gonna be down that store in
exactly 12 hours to kick me some butt!

166
00:11:48,413 --> 00:11:50,802
Or my name ain't Nathan Arizona!

167
00:11:55,093 --> 00:11:56,526
Sounds like Larry.

168
00:11:56,653 --> 00:11:58,644
No, no, no, no, no.

169
00:12:01,973 --> 00:12:03,770
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

170
00:12:07,013 --> 00:12:09,208
Quiet, quiet.

171
00:12:11,573 --> 00:12:13,564
OK, all right.

172
00:12:17,413 --> 00:12:19,404
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

173
00:12:24,293 --> 00:12:26,124
That's it. Good.

174
00:12:43,453 --> 00:12:45,648
Here's a rattle. A rattle.

175
00:12:46,173 --> 00:12:48,164
OK? Good.

176
00:13:02,973 --> 00:13:06,363
No, no. Quiet, quiet.

177
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,524
Come here.

178
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:14,282
Please come here. Come here.

179
00:14:53,813 --> 00:14:57,601
Why don't you go up and check on 'em?
They sound restless.

180
00:15:40,013 --> 00:15:43,369
- What's the matter?
- I'm sorry, honey. Itjust didn't work out.

181
00:15:43,453 --> 00:15:46,650
- What do you mean it didn't work out?
- Well, they...

182
00:15:46,733 --> 00:15:52,091
They started cryin' and they were all over me.
It was kinda horrifyin', honey. Let me in.

183
00:15:52,173 --> 00:15:54,892
- Of course they cried. Babies cry.
- Well, I know that.

184
00:15:54,973 --> 00:15:58,124
- Come on, honey. We'd better leave.
- Go back and get me a toddler.

185
00:15:58,213 --> 00:16:01,285
I need a baby, Hi.
They got more than they can handle.

186
00:16:01,373 --> 00:16:04,843
- Honey, l...
- Don't you come back here without a baby!

187
00:16:30,693 --> 00:16:32,888
Christian Dior, my butt!

188
00:16:34,613 --> 00:16:37,411
- They pay money for that?
- Yes, dear.

189
00:16:38,413 --> 00:16:41,007
- How're the kids?
- Fine, dear.

190
00:16:45,173 --> 00:16:47,926
- Which one you get?
- I don't know. Nathan Junior, I think.

191
00:16:48,013 --> 00:16:50,288
- Gimme here.
- Here's the instructions.

192
00:16:53,373 --> 00:16:54,567
He's beautiful.

193
00:16:54,653 --> 00:16:57,804
Yeah, he's awful damn good.
I think I got the best one.

194
00:16:57,893 --> 00:17:01,203
I bet they were all beautiful.
All babies are beautiful.

195
00:17:01,293 --> 00:17:04,171
- This one's awful damn good.
- Don't you cuss around him.

196
00:17:04,253 --> 00:17:09,407
- He's fine, he is. I think it's Nathan Junior.
- We are doin' the right thing, aren't we, Hi?

197
00:17:09,493 --> 00:17:12,212
- They had more than they could handle.
- Well, honey,

198
00:17:12,293 --> 00:17:16,172
we've been over this.
There's what's right and there's what's right.

199
00:17:16,253 --> 00:17:20,246
- Never the twain shall meet.
- But don't you think his mama'll be upset?

200
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:24,121
Well, of course she'll be upset,
sugar, but she'll get over it.

201
00:17:24,213 --> 00:17:28,126
She's got four little babies
almost as good as this one.

202
00:17:28,453 --> 00:17:30,569
It's like robbin' convenience stores.

203
00:17:30,653 --> 00:17:34,123
I love him so much!

204
00:17:36,693 --> 00:17:40,891
- I know you do, honey.
- I love him so much!

205
00:17:42,253 --> 00:17:44,289
I know you do.

206
00:18:07,693 --> 00:18:09,729
OK. Bring him in!

207
00:18:11,053 --> 00:18:14,648
This is it, young Nathan Junior!
You can feast your eyes about, old boy!

208
00:18:14,733 --> 00:18:17,122
- Don't be so loud around him.
- Damn, I'm sorry.

209
00:18:17,213 --> 00:18:20,364
- Don't cuss around him.
- He don't know a cuss word from Shinola.

210
00:18:20,453 --> 00:18:23,729
- Well, you see that he don't.
- I wanna hold him too.

211
00:18:23,813 --> 00:18:27,692
- Well, mind his little fontanelle.
- He's all right, he is.

212
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:31,812
Come on over here, young Nathan Junior.
I'm gonna show you around.

213
00:18:31,893 --> 00:18:33,884
Lookee here, young sportsman.

214
00:18:33,973 --> 00:18:37,363
That there's the kitchen area,
where Ma and Pa chow down.

215
00:18:37,453 --> 00:18:42,573
This here's the TV. Two hours a day
maximum, either educational or football,

216
00:18:42,653 --> 00:18:46,965
so as you don't ruin
your appreciation ofthe finer things.

217
00:18:47,053 --> 00:18:52,411
And this here's the divan, for socialisin'
and relaxin' with the family unit.

218
00:18:52,493 --> 00:18:56,008
Yes, sir. Many's the day
we sat there and we said

219
00:18:56,813 --> 00:19:00,772
"Wouldn't it be nice to have a youngster
to share our thoughts and feelings?"

220
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:04,641
- He's tired, Hi.
- Well, I'll just sit you right there, boy.

221
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:07,531
Just put those dogs up and take a load off.

222
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:34,251
What, are you kiddin'?
We got us a family here!

223
00:19:35,453 --> 00:19:38,365
He's a scandal, honey. He's a little outlaw.

224
00:19:38,573 --> 00:19:40,450
No, he's a good boy.

225
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:44,003
He ain't too good.
You can tell by that twinkle in his eye.

226
00:19:44,093 --> 00:19:46,891
- Don't you think we oughta put him to bed?
- Hang on, honey.

227
00:19:46,973 --> 00:19:50,966
- Let's just preserve the moment in pictures.
- Just one, OK?

228
00:19:52,013 --> 00:19:55,483
I gotta tell ya... I'm a little scared, Hi.

229
00:19:55,573 --> 00:19:58,133
- How come is that, honey?
- Well...

230
00:19:58,213 --> 00:20:01,603
We got a baby, Hi.
It's an awful big responsibility.

231
00:20:01,693 --> 00:20:04,651
Honey, could you slide over a tad
and raise the nipper up?

232
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:08,965
I mean, we never done this before
and I'm kinda nervous.

233
00:20:09,053 --> 00:20:11,203
You're doin' real good, sugar.

234
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,688
- I love you, Hi.
- We're set to pop here, honey.

235
00:20:18,773 --> 00:20:21,845
- Now, you're gonna help, aren't you?
- How's that, honey?

236
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:25,403
Contribute to the management ofthe child.

237
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:29,161
- Quiet evenings together.
- You can count on it.

238
00:20:29,253 --> 00:20:32,131
Everything decent and normal
from here on out.

239
00:20:32,213 --> 00:20:34,408
We're set to pop here, honey.

240
00:21:59,373 --> 00:22:01,841
- OK.
- What is she?

241
00:22:01,933 --> 00:22:04,128
Station wagon. Looks nice.

242
00:22:32,453 --> 00:22:34,364
Open up! It's the police!

243
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,523
- Hi, what's goin' on?
- You stay in here.

244
00:22:36,613 --> 00:22:39,764
- Open up!
- They ain't gonna split up the family.

245
00:22:39,853 --> 00:22:43,323
- Open up in there!
- I'd like to see 'em try.

246
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:48,491
Open up! Maybe we'll let you plea bargain!

247
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:53,289
- Hi there, you old woodpecker!
- Boys!

248
00:22:53,933 --> 00:22:56,606
Gale, don't make me sick!

249
00:22:56,693 --> 00:22:58,445
Asshole!

250
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:05,161
Honey, I'd like you to meet Gale
and Evelle Snopes.

251
00:23:05,893 --> 00:23:09,329
As fine a pair as ever broke and entered!

252
00:23:11,773 --> 00:23:14,571
Boys... this here's my wife.

253
00:23:15,933 --> 00:23:18,288
- Ma'am.
- Ms McDunnough.

254
00:23:18,373 --> 00:23:22,332
- Kinda late for visitors, isn't it, Hi?
- Well, yeah, honey.

255
00:23:22,413 --> 00:23:26,372
But these boys just got outta the joint,
so we gotta show a little hospitality.

256
00:23:26,453 --> 00:23:30,810
Well, now, H l. Looks like you've
been up to the devil's business.

257
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:35,685
- Hey, is that a him or a her?
- It's a little boy.

258
00:23:37,893 --> 00:23:41,124
- Got a name, does he?
- So far we just been usin' Junior.

259
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:45,525
- We call him Junior.
- You mean JR, just like the TV show?

260
00:23:49,693 --> 00:23:52,651
- That's good!
- "Welcome home, son."

261
00:23:53,613 --> 00:23:54,966
Where's he been?

262
00:23:55,053 --> 00:23:57,089
- Phoenix.
- Tulsa.

263
00:23:57,173 --> 00:24:00,529
- He was visitin' his grandparents.
- They're separated.

264
00:24:00,613 --> 00:24:03,923
- That'd be your folks, ma'am.
- No, I'm afraid not.

265
00:24:04,013 --> 00:24:06,447
Well, you said your folks was dead, H l.

266
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:10,685
Well, we thought Junior
should see their final restin' place.

267
00:24:10,773 --> 00:24:13,162
Why don't you boys have a seat?

268
00:24:16,893 --> 00:24:19,088
Hi, it's two in the mornin'.

269
00:24:21,013 --> 00:24:23,129
What's that smell?

270
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:25,681
We don't always smell this way,
Ms McDunnough.

271
00:24:25,773 --> 00:24:29,243
I was explainin' to your better half
that, when we were tunnellin' out,

272
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:32,609
we happened to hit the main sewer line.
Dumb luck, that.

273
00:24:32,693 --> 00:24:35,412
- And we followed that to...
- You busted outtajail?

274
00:24:35,493 --> 00:24:38,565
No, ma'am. We released ourselves
on our own recognisance.

275
00:24:38,653 --> 00:24:43,443
What Evelle is tryin' to say is we felt the
institution no longer had anything to offer us.

276
00:24:43,533 --> 00:24:46,889
- My Lord, he's cute!
- He's a little outlaw. You can see that, Hi.

277
00:24:46,973 --> 00:24:49,771
Now, listen, you folks can't stay here.

278
00:24:50,613 --> 00:24:52,604
- Ma'am?
- You just can't stay.

279
00:24:52,693 --> 00:24:56,686
I appreciate you bein' friends of Hi an' all,
but this is a decent family now.

280
00:24:56,773 --> 00:24:59,048
I mean, we got a toddler here.

281
00:25:01,813 --> 00:25:04,247
Say, who wears the pants round here, H l?

282
00:25:05,973 --> 00:25:09,249
- Honey, these boys just got outta the joint...
- Don't "honey" me!

283
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:13,804
Now you boys can sit awhile and catch up,
but then you be on your way.

284
00:25:22,733 --> 00:25:25,611
Got you on an awful short leash,
don't she, H l?

285
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:45,924
They still here?

286
00:25:46,853 --> 00:25:51,768
Yeah.
They're just gonna stay a day or two, honey.

287
00:25:51,853 --> 00:25:54,686
It's rainin' out, they got nowheres to go...

288
00:25:54,773 --> 00:25:59,642
They're fugitives, Hi. How're we gonna
start a new life with them around?

289
00:25:59,973 --> 00:26:03,204
Well, now, honey,
you gotta have a little charity.

290
00:26:04,413 --> 00:26:08,008
You know,
in Arab lands, they'd set out a plate.

291
00:26:08,093 --> 00:26:10,482
Promise just a day or two.

292
00:26:11,973 --> 00:26:14,362
Tonight and tomorrow, tops.

293
00:26:17,453 --> 00:26:19,762
That nightlhada dream.

294
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:25,083
I drifted off, thinkin'about
happiness, birth andnewlife.

295
00:26:26,813 --> 00:26:29,611
But nowl was hauntedbya vision of...

296
00:26:32,413 --> 00:26:34,483
He was horrible.

297
00:26:36,373 --> 00:26:39,410
The lone biker ofthe Apocalypse.

298
00:26:40,173 --> 00:26:42,926
A man with all the powers
ofHellathis command.

299
00:26:45,413 --> 00:26:48,530
He could turn the dayinto night

300
00:26:48,613 --> 00:26:51,605
and lay to waste everything in his path.

301
00:26:55,173 --> 00:27:00,452
He was especiallyhard on the little things,
the helpless and the gentle creatures.

302
00:27:01,533 --> 00:27:03,842
He lefta scorched earth in his wake,

303
00:27:03,933 --> 00:27:08,449
befoulin' even the sweet desertbreeze
that whippedacross his brow.

304
00:27:10,053 --> 00:27:13,284
I didn'tknow where he came from or why.

305
00:27:13,973 --> 00:27:18,171
I didn'tknowifhe was dream or vision.

306
00:27:19,613 --> 00:27:23,686
But lfeared thatlmyselfhad unleashedhim.

307
00:27:27,053 --> 00:27:30,011
For he was the fury that wouldbe,

308
00:27:30,093 --> 00:27:34,086
as soon as Florence Arizona
found herlittle Nathan gone.

309
00:27:52,813 --> 00:27:57,443
# Father sits at his cabin door

310
00:27:58,213 --> 00:28:02,365
# Wiping his tear-dimmed eyes

311
00:28:02,853 --> 00:28:08,644
# For his only son soon shall walk

312
00:28:08,733 --> 00:28:12,408
# To yonder scaffold rise

313
00:28:12,493 --> 00:28:15,326
- You all right?
- Well, he's all right.

314
00:28:15,413 --> 00:28:17,722
He was just havin' a nightmare.

315
00:28:17,813 --> 00:28:23,331
# My race is run beneath the sun

316
00:28:23,733 --> 00:28:28,170
# The scaffold now waits for me

317
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:34,245
# For I did murder that dear little girl

318
00:28:34,733 --> 00:28:37,008
# Whose name was Rose Connelly

319
00:28:37,093 --> 00:28:40,210
Sometimes it's a hard world for little things.

320
00:28:46,733 --> 00:28:51,170
Now, the missis and the rest
of the kids have left town

321
00:28:51,253 --> 00:28:56,532
to... I ain't sayin' where. They'll be back
here when we're a nuclear family again.

322
00:28:56,613 --> 00:29:00,401
- Mr Arizona, which tot was abducted?
- Nathan Junior, I think.

323
00:29:00,493 --> 00:29:04,008
- Anything to say to the kidnappers?
- Yeah. Watch your butts!

324
00:29:04,093 --> 00:29:06,482
It's rumoured your son
was abducted by UFOs.

325
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:09,610
- Would you care to comment?
- Don't print that, son.

326
00:29:09,693 --> 00:29:12,890
If his mama reads that,
she's just gonna lose all hope.

327
00:29:12,973 --> 00:29:16,010
Sir, we really need to
ask you some more questions.

328
00:29:16,093 --> 00:29:20,371
But remember it's still
business as usual at Unpainted Arizona.

329
00:29:20,453 --> 00:29:25,732
If you can find lower prices anywhere,
my name still ain't Nathan Arizona!

330
00:29:31,533 --> 00:29:34,843
Mr Byrum here can take
your exemplars while you talk.

331
00:29:34,933 --> 00:29:37,128
Just relax your hand. I'll do the work.

332
00:29:37,213 --> 00:29:41,001
- What is this? I didn't steal the damn kid!
- Sir, these men are with the FBl.

333
00:29:41,093 --> 00:29:44,369
Are you crazy? Alls I know is,
I wake up and my wife's screamin'.

334
00:29:44,453 --> 00:29:49,607
We just need to distinguish your prints
from the perpetrator, ifthey left any.

335
00:29:49,693 --> 00:29:54,562
- Of course. I know that.
- Sir, were you born Nathan Huffhines?

336
00:29:54,653 --> 00:29:57,963
- Yeah, I changed my name. What of it?
- Can you tell us why?

337
00:29:58,053 --> 00:30:00,965
Yeah. Would you buy furniture
at "Unpainted Huffhines"?

338
00:30:01,053 --> 00:30:04,204
- I'll get to the point...
- Was the child wearing anything?

339
00:30:04,293 --> 00:30:07,251
- Nobody sleeps naked in this house!
- I'll ask the questions!

340
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:09,563
To put an APB out, I need a description.

341
00:30:09,653 --> 00:30:13,441
We're better trained to intervene
in a crisis situation. What was he wearing?

342
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:16,206
A dinnerjacket. What do you think?
His damn jammies!

343
00:30:16,293 --> 00:30:19,603
- He was wearing his jammies. Happy?
- Any disgruntled employees?

344
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:22,844
Hell, they're all disgruntled.
I ain't runnin' a daisy farm.

345
00:30:22,933 --> 00:30:26,972
- I say do it my way or watch your butt!
- So it might have been an employee?

346
00:30:27,053 --> 00:30:30,363
Without my say-so, they wouldn't
piss with their pants on fire.

347
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:33,889
- What did the pyjamas look like?
- I don't know. They were jammies!

348
00:30:33,973 --> 00:30:38,763
They had Yodas and shit on 'em.
Get your damn feet off my coffee table!

349
00:30:38,853 --> 00:30:42,448
- Ron, you are upsetting the victim!
- Are you boys gonna chase your leads

350
00:30:42,533 --> 00:30:47,243
or sit drinkin' coffee in the one house
in the state where I know my boy ain't at?

351
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:50,370
Well, we don't have any leads as yet,
aside from the coat.

352
00:30:50,453 --> 00:30:53,172
Gimme that! That's a $500 camel's-hair coat.

353
00:30:53,253 --> 00:30:56,404
Sir, you might want
to wash your hands at this point.

354
00:30:57,773 --> 00:31:00,207
Goddammit!

355
00:31:00,293 --> 00:31:06,209
No leads! Everyone leaves microbes and
whatnot. Hell, that's your forte, ain't it?

356
00:31:06,293 --> 00:31:09,444
Trackin' down microbes left by
criminals and commies and shit.

357
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:11,888
That's your whole raison d'Ãªtre, ain't it?

358
00:31:11,973 --> 00:31:17,093
No leads! I want Nathan Junior back! Or
whichever the hell one of 'em they took!

359
00:31:17,173 --> 00:31:20,882
He's out there somewhere.
Somethin' leads to him!

360
00:31:20,973 --> 00:31:24,966
Anyone can find him knows the difference
between a lead and a hole in the ground!

361
00:32:27,973 --> 00:32:30,965
Awful good cereal flakes, Ms McDunnough.

362
00:32:38,293 --> 00:32:40,488
Why ain't you breast-feedin'?

363
00:32:41,933 --> 00:32:43,924
You appear to be capable.

364
00:32:44,013 --> 00:32:46,004
- Mind your own business.
- Ma'am,

365
00:32:46,093 --> 00:32:50,086
you don't breast-feed him, he hates you
later. That's why we wound up in prison.

366
00:32:50,173 --> 00:32:53,006
Anyway, that's what Doc Schwartz tells us.

367
00:32:53,093 --> 00:32:55,084
Boys.

368
00:32:56,653 --> 00:32:58,644
Mornin', Hi.

369
00:33:02,693 --> 00:33:04,490
Hi...

370
00:33:05,933 --> 00:33:08,163
Oh, yeah.

371
00:33:09,653 --> 00:33:11,371
Say, boys...

372
00:33:11,453 --> 00:33:16,129
You wouldn't mind makin' yourselves scarce
for a coupla hours this afternoon, would ya?

373
00:33:16,213 --> 00:33:19,046
We're havin' some decent friends over.

374
00:33:21,853 --> 00:33:23,923
What Ed means to say is,...

375
00:33:24,853 --> 00:33:28,050
seein' as you two boys are wanted,

376
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:35,082
it wouldn't exactly do to have folks seein'
you here. It's for your own protection.

377
00:33:35,173 --> 00:33:38,131
- Sure, H l.
- Anything you say, Hi.

378
00:33:39,013 --> 00:33:43,086
Matter offact, honey,
I think I'll skip this little get-together myself.

379
00:33:43,173 --> 00:33:47,724
Glen won't mind. I'll just duck out with
the boys, knock back a coupla co-colas.

380
00:33:48,573 --> 00:33:51,326
- Sure, H l.
- We'd love to have you, Hi.

381
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:58,409
Maybe that ain't such a swell idea, either.

382
00:34:02,453 --> 00:34:04,842
So many social engagements,

383
00:34:06,093 --> 00:34:08,084
so little time.

384
00:34:16,133 --> 00:34:18,772
Where's that baby? Where is he at?

385
00:34:18,853 --> 00:34:21,890
- Go find him, honey!
- Cut it out, Glen!

386
00:34:21,973 --> 00:34:23,964
He's asleep right now.

387
00:34:24,053 --> 00:34:26,089
Shit! I hope we didn't wake it!

388
00:34:26,173 --> 00:34:28,767
Can I just sneak a peek-a-loo?

389
00:34:29,253 --> 00:34:32,848
Come on, kids!
Get away from Mr McDunnough's car!

390
00:34:40,173 --> 00:34:42,368
What's his name?

391
00:34:43,253 --> 00:34:47,132
Hi... Hi Junior, till we think of a better one.

392
00:34:47,893 --> 00:34:50,612
Why don't ya call him Jason?
I love biblical names.

393
00:34:50,693 --> 00:34:53,685
If I had another little boy,
I'd name him Jason, Caleb or Tab.

394
00:34:54,733 --> 00:34:58,248
He's an angel!
He's an angel straight from heaven!

395
00:34:58,333 --> 00:35:00,449
Now honey, I had all my kids the hard way.

396
00:35:00,533 --> 00:35:04,446
Tell me how you got this little angel.
Did he fly straight down from heaven?

397
00:35:04,533 --> 00:35:07,411
- Well...
- You're gonna send him to Arizona State.

398
00:35:12,253 --> 00:35:14,244
Gimme a Twinkie!

399
00:35:16,693 --> 00:35:20,163
- You need a beer, Glen?
- Does the Pope wear a funny hat?

400
00:35:20,253 --> 00:35:23,290
Yeah, Glen, I guess it is kinda funny.

401
00:35:23,373 --> 00:35:28,288
Say, that reminds me. How many Polacks
does it take to screw up a light bulb?

402
00:35:28,373 --> 00:35:30,682
I don't know, Glen. One?

403
00:35:30,773 --> 00:35:32,764
No, it takes three.

404
00:35:39,213 --> 00:35:44,765
I told it wrong. I'll start again. How come it
takes three Polacks to screw up a light bulb?

405
00:35:44,853 --> 00:35:48,732
- I don't know, Glen.
- Cos they're so darn stupid!

406
00:35:50,453 --> 00:35:54,241
Shit, man! Listen up!
What's the matter? Don't ya get it?

407
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,843
- No, Glen, I sure don't.
- Well, shit, man.

408
00:35:58,933 --> 00:36:01,208
I guess that's why they call it a way-homer.

409
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:04,171
- Why's that?
- Cos you only get it on the way home.

410
00:36:04,253 --> 00:36:05,925
I'm already home, Glen.

411
00:36:07,093 --> 00:36:09,209
You wet yourself! You wet yourself!

412
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:12,171
Mr McDunnough wet himself, Daddy!

413
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,972
Say, that reminds me.
How'd you get that kid so fast?

414
00:36:15,053 --> 00:36:17,806
Me and Dot went to adopt -
somethin' wrong with my semen.

415
00:36:17,893 --> 00:36:20,407
They said we had to wait
five years for a healthy white baby.

416
00:36:20,493 --> 00:36:24,042
I said "Healthy white baby, five years?
OK, what else you got?"

417
00:36:24,133 --> 00:36:29,048
They said they got two Koreans and
a Negro born with his heart on the outside.

418
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:32,011
- It's a crazy world.
- Someone oughta sell tickets.

419
00:36:32,093 --> 00:36:34,084
Sure. I'd buy one.

420
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:40,608
That Buford's a sly one.
He already knows his ABCs. Watch this.

421
00:36:40,693 --> 00:36:43,002
Hit the deck, boy!

422
00:36:45,093 --> 00:36:48,051
But like I'm sayin', how'd you get the kid?

423
00:36:48,133 --> 00:36:51,682
Well, this whole thing is just who knows who.

424
00:36:52,573 --> 00:36:54,723
Then over here you have favouritism.

425
00:36:54,813 --> 00:36:57,008
Ed has a friend at one ofthe agencies.

426
00:36:57,093 --> 00:37:00,802
Maybe she can help me and Dot.
There's somethin' wrong with my semen.

427
00:37:00,893 --> 00:37:03,168
What you gonna name it?

428
00:37:03,253 --> 00:37:05,369
Ed. Ed Junior.

429
00:37:05,453 --> 00:37:09,810
- But I thought you said it was a boy.
- Well, as in Edward. We just like that name.

430
00:37:09,893 --> 00:37:12,646
It's a good one.
I don't really need another kid,

431
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:15,372
but Dot says these are
gettin' too big to cuddle.

432
00:37:15,453 --> 00:37:17,444
Say, that reminds me...

433
00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:21,445
Mind you don't cut yourself, Mordecai.

434
00:37:22,493 --> 00:37:25,405
Then there's diphtheria-tetanus,
what they call dip-tet.

435
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:29,771
They need dip-tet boosters yearly,
or they develop lockjaw and night vision.

436
00:37:29,853 --> 00:37:33,129
Then there's the smallpox vaccine,
chicken pox and measles.

437
00:37:33,213 --> 00:37:37,286
If your kid's like ours, you'll have to get
all those shots before he'll take 'em.

438
00:37:37,373 --> 00:37:42,606
- Who's your paediatrician?
- We ain't exactly fixed on one yet, have we?

439
00:37:45,053 --> 00:37:49,410
- No, I guess we don't have one yet.
- Jesus! Well, you gotta have one this instant!

440
00:37:49,493 --> 00:37:53,486
- What ifthe baby gets sick, honey?
- Even if he don't, he's gotta have his dip-tet.

441
00:37:53,573 --> 00:37:56,406
He's gotta have his dip-tet, honey.

442
00:37:56,493 --> 00:38:00,281
- You started his bank accounts yet?
- Have we done that? We gotta do that.

443
00:38:00,373 --> 00:38:03,968
- What's that for, Dot?
- His orthodonture and his university.

444
00:38:04,053 --> 00:38:09,081
Use iodine, you might save on orthodonture.
Won't knock a thing offthe university.

445
00:38:09,173 --> 00:38:13,405
Riley! You take that diaper offyour head!
You put it back onto your sister!

446
00:38:13,493 --> 00:38:16,963
Anyway, you probably got
the life insurance all squared away.

447
00:38:17,053 --> 00:38:19,283
Have we done that yet, honey?

448
00:38:20,533 --> 00:38:21,727
Gotta do that, Hi.

449
00:38:21,813 --> 00:38:24,646
- Ed's got her hands full with this angel.
- Yes, ma'am.

450
00:38:24,733 --> 00:38:29,045
What would Ed and little angel do if a truck
splattered your brains over the interstate?

451
00:38:29,133 --> 00:38:31,727
Yeah, honey. What ifyou get run over?

452
00:38:31,813 --> 00:38:34,725
Or you got carried off by a twister?

453
00:38:35,373 --> 00:38:39,366
Say, that reminds me. You hear about
the person of Polish persuasion?

454
00:38:39,453 --> 00:38:42,286
He walks into a bar with this
big pile of shit in his hand

455
00:38:42,373 --> 00:38:45,092
and says "Look what I almost stepped in!"

456
00:38:45,173 --> 00:38:50,167
- Yeah, that's funny all right.
- Damn right! Shit, man, what's the matter?

457
00:38:51,013 --> 00:38:53,925
I don't know. Maybe it's...

458
00:38:55,053 --> 00:38:58,045
the wife, kids, family life. I mean...

459
00:39:00,733 --> 00:39:03,406
Are you satisfied, Glen?

460
00:39:04,533 --> 00:39:07,127
Don't you ever feel... suffocated?

461
00:39:07,933 --> 00:39:11,721
Like there's somethin' big pressin' down?

462
00:39:12,813 --> 00:39:15,532
Yeah, I do know that feelin'.

463
00:39:17,293 --> 00:39:21,491
And I told Dot to lose some weight,
but she don't wanna listen.

464
00:39:22,453 --> 00:39:26,605
No, man, I know what you mean.
You got all these responsibilities now.

465
00:39:26,693 --> 00:39:30,766
You're married, you got a kid,
it looks like your whole life is set down...

466
00:39:30,853 --> 00:39:33,686
- Where's the excitement?
- Yeah, Glen, I guess that's it.

467
00:39:33,773 --> 00:39:36,526
OK, that's a disease, but you got a cure.

468
00:39:36,613 --> 00:39:37,728
Yeah?

469
00:39:37,813 --> 00:39:40,850
Dr Glen is here to tell you
that you can heal thyself.

470
00:39:40,933 --> 00:39:45,449
- What do I gotta do?
- Well, you just gotta broaden your mind.

471
00:39:45,533 --> 00:39:48,445
Say if I was to ask you
"What do you think about Dot?"

472
00:39:48,533 --> 00:39:50,922
Well, she's a fine woman you got there.

473
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:55,006
OK, now you might not know it
to look at her, but she's a hellcat.

474
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:57,766
- That right?
- T-l-G-E-R.

475
00:39:58,453 --> 00:40:02,241
- Well, what's that gotta do with...
- Now, don't rush me.

476
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,528
The thing about Dot is...

477
00:40:04,613 --> 00:40:07,207
She told me this. She thinks...

478
00:40:08,533 --> 00:40:11,001
She thinks you're cute.

479
00:40:11,853 --> 00:40:12,444
Yeah?

480
00:40:12,533 --> 00:40:17,049
I'm crappin' you negative.
And I could say the same thing about Ed.

481
00:40:18,053 --> 00:40:21,250
- What are you talkin' about, Glen?
- What am I talkin' about?

482
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:23,972
I'm talkin' about sex.
What are you talkin' about?

483
00:40:24,053 --> 00:40:27,523
I'm talkin' about I'amour.
I'm talkin' that me and Dot are swingers.

484
00:40:27,613 --> 00:40:31,811
As in, to swing.
I'm talkin' about wife-swappin'.

485
00:40:32,133 --> 00:40:34,886
I'm talkin' about what they
call now "open marriage"...

486
00:40:37,053 --> 00:40:39,851
Keep your goddamn hands off my wife.

487
00:40:43,293 --> 00:40:46,330
I was only tryin' to help! You're crazy!

488
00:40:46,533 --> 00:40:50,572
- You're crazy, man!
- Keep your goddamn hands off my wife!

489
00:40:50,653 --> 00:40:52,723
You're crazy! I pity you!

490
00:41:06,053 --> 00:41:10,729
We finally go out with some decent people
and you break his nose. That ain't funny, Hi.

491
00:41:10,813 --> 00:41:14,601
- His kids seemed to think it was funny.
- Well, they're just kids.

492
00:41:14,693 --> 00:41:19,084
You're a grown man with responsibilities.
Whatever possessed ya?

493
00:41:19,973 --> 00:41:22,771
- He was provokin' me.
- How'd he do that?

494
00:41:26,613 --> 00:41:29,810
- Never mind.
- But, Hi, he's your foreman.

495
00:41:29,893 --> 00:41:32,282
He's just gonna fire you now.

496
00:41:32,893 --> 00:41:35,612
- I expect he will.
- Where does that leave the three of us?

497
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:38,685
Where does that leave our entire family unit?

498
00:41:42,413 --> 00:41:45,803
- With a man for a husband.
- That ain't no answer.

499
00:41:46,973 --> 00:41:50,045
- Honey, that's the only answer.
- That ain't no answer.

500
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:52,328
With a man for a husband.

501
00:41:59,573 --> 00:42:01,768
Nathan needs some Huggies.

502
00:42:04,253 --> 00:42:06,483
I'll be out directly.

503
00:42:11,413 --> 00:42:13,324
Mind you stay strapped in.

504
00:42:19,173 --> 00:42:21,562
Wake up, son.

505
00:42:22,893 --> 00:42:26,169
I'll be takin' these Huggies
and whatever cash you got.

506
00:42:26,253 --> 00:42:30,485
"No, no, not by the hair on my
chinny-chin-chin" said the little pig.

507
00:42:30,573 --> 00:42:32,643
Look at that. Look at him.

508
00:42:33,373 --> 00:42:35,364
"Then I'll..."

509
00:42:39,413 --> 00:42:43,850
"Then I'll huff and I'll puff
and I'll blow your house in."

510
00:42:45,493 --> 00:42:47,051
That son of a bitch.

511
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:50,324
That son of a bitch!

512
00:42:55,053 --> 00:42:58,762
- You son of a bitch!
- Better hurry it up. I'm in Dutch with the wife.

513
00:42:59,533 --> 00:43:00,852
You son of a bitch!

514
00:43:02,893 --> 00:43:03,882
Come on now!

515
00:43:09,133 --> 00:43:11,124
Honey?

516
00:44:26,013 --> 00:44:28,447
That son of a bitch.

517
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:31,525
Hold on, Nathan.
We're gonna go pick up Daddy.

518
00:44:47,453 --> 00:44:49,921
Son, you got a panty on your head.

519
00:44:50,013 --> 00:44:52,083
Just drive fast, OK?

520
00:45:08,253 --> 00:45:09,811
Wait. There's the wife.

521
00:45:09,893 --> 00:45:12,851
Honey! Mind the baby now!

522
00:45:30,893 --> 00:45:34,124
Hang on, Nathan.
We're gonna take a short cut.

523
00:45:41,533 --> 00:45:42,682
Can I stop now?

524
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:51,846
Thank you.

525
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,483
That's private property, son.

526
00:45:58,573 --> 00:46:04,569
Come out to the streetandrevealyourself
to Offiicer Steensma and Offiicer Scott.

527
00:46:12,733 --> 00:46:14,724
Son of a bitch!

528
00:47:34,973 --> 00:47:37,931
Thank you, honey,
but you really didn't have to do this.

529
00:47:38,013 --> 00:47:41,005
Son of a bitch!
What if me and the baby had been picked up?

530
00:47:41,093 --> 00:47:43,971
- Turn left here.
- He'd be accessory to armed robbery.

531
00:47:44,053 --> 00:47:48,524
- It ain't armed robbery ifthe gun ain't loaded.
- What kind of home life is it for a toddler?

532
00:47:48,613 --> 00:47:50,922
- You supposed to be an example.
- For what?

533
00:47:51,013 --> 00:47:54,722
I never postured myself as
a three-piece suit type. Turn right, honey.

534
00:47:54,813 --> 00:48:00,171
- We got a child now! Everything's changed!
- Nathan Junior accepts me for what I am.

535
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:04,963
And I think you better had too.
You know, honey: I'm OK, you're OK.

536
00:48:05,053 --> 00:48:07,772
- That there's what it is.
- I know, but, honey...

537
00:48:07,853 --> 00:48:10,208
See, I come from a long line offrontiersmen.

538
00:48:10,293 --> 00:48:13,330
Here it is, dear. Turn here.
Frontiersmen and outdoor types.

539
00:48:13,413 --> 00:48:17,088
I'm not gonna live this way, Hi.
It just ain't family life.

540
00:48:17,173 --> 00:48:20,449
Well, it ain't Ozzie andHarriet.

541
00:48:44,973 --> 00:48:49,285
You two are leavin'. I got nothin' against you,
but you're wanted by the authorities.

542
00:48:49,373 --> 00:48:52,922
And you're a bad influence
in this household in my opinion.

543
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:55,004
Well, ma'am...

544
00:48:55,893 --> 00:48:58,282
We sure didn't mean to influence anybody.

545
00:48:58,373 --> 00:49:00,841
And ifwe did, ma'am, we apologise.

546
00:49:00,933 --> 00:49:05,643
I'm goin' tomorrow to see about shots for the
baby. When I come back, you better be gone.

547
00:49:24,053 --> 00:49:26,362
What's he need, his dip-tet?

548
00:49:26,853 --> 00:49:30,846
I'm awful sorry, boys, but when Ed gets mad,

549
00:49:30,933 --> 00:49:33,686
you know, she gets an idea.

550
00:49:33,773 --> 00:49:36,571
There ain't a thing to apologise for, H l.

551
00:49:37,213 --> 00:49:40,205
Seems pretty clear what the situation is here.

552
00:49:41,333 --> 00:49:45,087
Yeah.
I guess the missis wants us to clear out.

553
00:49:45,173 --> 00:49:48,529
Now, H l, ifyou'll pardon me for sayin' so,

554
00:49:50,093 --> 00:49:54,848
- I get the feelin' that this ain't workin' out.
- Edwina's generally a real sweetheart.

555
00:49:54,933 --> 00:49:57,925
And, as per usual, I wouldn't be surprised

556
00:49:58,013 --> 00:50:02,484
if the source of
the marital friction weren't financial.

557
00:50:02,573 --> 00:50:07,010
As a matter offact, I did lose myjob today.

558
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:13,088
Hi, you're young and you got your health.
What you want with ajob?

559
00:50:13,173 --> 00:50:16,927
But I'd rather light a candle
than curse your darkness.

560
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:22,212
Now, as you know, Evelle here and I never
go anywhere without there's a purpose.

561
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:26,047
And here we are in your little domicile.

562
00:50:28,933 --> 00:50:32,005
- We come to invite you in on a little score.
- A bank, H l.

563
00:50:32,093 --> 00:50:34,084
Come on now!

564
00:50:34,853 --> 00:50:38,641
I know you're partial to
convenience stores, but dammit, H l,

565
00:50:40,253 --> 00:50:43,245
the sun don't rise and set
on the corner grocery.

566
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:47,246
It's like Doc Schwartz says,
you gotta have a little bit of ambition.

567
00:50:47,333 --> 00:50:52,532
We just watchin' on the news. Somebody
snatched up one ofthem Arizona babies.

568
00:50:55,253 --> 00:50:58,802
- For chrissakes.
- That there's somebody who's thinkin' big.

569
00:50:58,893 --> 00:51:04,206
And here you are, sittin' on your butt, playin'
house with a - don't get me wrong, H I -

570
00:51:04,293 --> 00:51:09,048
with a fine woman, but a woman
who needs one ofthem button-down types.

571
00:51:09,133 --> 00:51:14,253
- I don't particularly think that's any ofyour...
- Hold on, H l. Now lookee there.

572
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:16,005
That's a picture of EI Dorado.

573
00:51:16,093 --> 00:51:19,642
The locals call it the Farmers
and Mechanics Bank of La Grange.

574
00:51:19,733 --> 00:51:23,248
Looks like a hayseed bank.
Tell you the truth, it is a hayseed bank.

575
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:27,884
But the last Friday of every financial quarter,
it has more cash than flies at a barbecue.

576
00:51:27,973 --> 00:51:31,966
- And guess what day it is tomorrow.
- When all the hayseeds come in and

577
00:51:32,053 --> 00:51:34,647
cash their farm subsidies cheques.

578
00:51:34,733 --> 00:51:36,963
- A1 information, Hi.
- Got it in the joint

579
00:51:37,053 --> 00:51:41,524
from a guy named Lawrence Spivey, one of
Dick Nixon's undersecretary of agricultures.

580
00:51:41,613 --> 00:51:43,683
In for soliciting sex from a state trooper.

581
00:51:43,773 --> 00:51:47,083
Ordinarily we don't associate
with that type of person, but...

582
00:51:47,173 --> 00:51:49,971
he was tryin' to make a few Brownie points.

583
00:51:50,053 --> 00:51:51,771
Boys, I can't.

584
00:51:51,853 --> 00:51:55,732
Hi, we need someone handy with
a scatter-gun, coverin' them hayseeds,

585
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:58,043
while we go in there and get that cash.

586
00:51:58,133 --> 00:52:02,285
You understand, H l? lfthis works out,
it's just the beginning of a spree

587
00:52:02,373 --> 00:52:08,050
to cover the entire Southwest. And we keep
goin' until we can retire... or we get caught.

588
00:52:09,053 --> 00:52:11,521
Either way, we're fixed for life.

589
00:52:16,613 --> 00:52:18,808
Boys, it's a kind offer, but...

590
00:52:19,773 --> 00:52:22,765
you're suggesting I just up and leave Ed.

591
00:52:24,093 --> 00:52:26,607
And that'd be pretty
damn cowardly, wouldn't it?

592
00:52:26,693 --> 00:52:29,207
Would it? Think about it, H l.

593
00:52:30,693 --> 00:52:34,811
Seems to me sittin' here
you ain't doin' her any good.

594
00:52:34,893 --> 00:52:37,885
And you ain't bein' true to your own nature.

595
00:52:51,773 --> 00:52:53,968
My dearestEdwina,

596
00:52:55,173 --> 00:53:00,167
tonight, as you andNathan slumber,
my heartis filled with anguish.

597
00:53:01,853 --> 00:53:07,644
I hope thatyou willboth understand, and
forgive me for whatlhave decidedlmust do.

598
00:53:08,573 --> 00:53:11,770
By the time you read this, I willbe gone.

599
00:53:14,973 --> 00:53:18,045
I willneverbe the man thatyou wantme to be.

600
00:53:19,133 --> 00:53:23,729
The husbandandfather
that you andNathan deserve.

601
00:53:25,893 --> 00:53:28,088
Maybe it's my upbringing.

602
00:53:28,853 --> 00:53:32,050
Maybe it'sjust thatmygenes gotscrewed up.

603
00:53:33,693 --> 00:53:35,684
I don'tknow.

604
00:53:37,213 --> 00:53:41,604
But the events ofthe last day
have showedamply

605
00:53:43,373 --> 00:53:48,652
that I don'thave the strength
of character to raise up a family

606
00:53:48,733 --> 00:53:52,328
in the mannerbefitting a responsible adult.

607
00:53:54,693 --> 00:53:56,888
I sayall this to myshame.

608
00:54:00,853 --> 00:54:05,244
I wiIllove you always, trulyand deeply.

609
00:54:07,493 --> 00:54:12,647
But lfear that, iflstay,
I would onlybring bad trouble

610
00:54:12,733 --> 00:54:15,930
on the heads ofyou andNathan Junior.

611
00:54:17,373 --> 00:54:20,171
I feel the thundergathering even now.

612
00:54:21,853 --> 00:54:25,050
Iflleave, hopefully,

613
00:54:26,613 --> 00:54:28,808
it wiIlleave with me.

614
00:54:31,253 --> 00:54:33,244
I cannot tarry.

615
00:54:34,613 --> 00:54:40,404
Better lshouldgo, sendyou money
and letyou curse myname.

616
00:54:43,533 --> 00:54:45,524
Your loving -

617
00:54:50,173 --> 00:54:52,164
Herbert.

618
00:55:50,093 --> 00:55:53,802
Mr Arizona, he just barged in.
Should I call Duane?

619
00:55:54,933 --> 00:55:58,289
Hell, no. Why wake the security guard?

620
00:55:58,373 --> 00:56:00,364
I'll take care ofthis.

621
00:56:13,733 --> 00:56:16,372
- You got flies.
- I doubt it.

622
00:56:17,493 --> 00:56:21,884
This place is climate-controlled.
All the windows are sealed.

623
00:56:23,533 --> 00:56:27,526
- Who the hell are you?
- Smalls. Leonard Smalls.

624
00:56:28,813 --> 00:56:32,203
My friends call me Lenny.
But I got no friends.

625
00:56:33,333 --> 00:56:36,131
Stop. You're gonna make me bust out cryin'.

626
00:56:36,213 --> 00:56:40,889
Listen, Leonard... you want some furniture
or a shit-box, they're on the sales floor.

627
00:56:40,973 --> 00:56:44,204
I'm not a customer. I'm a manhunter.

628
00:56:45,533 --> 00:56:49,048
Now, of course, I do hunt babies on occasion.

629
00:56:49,133 --> 00:56:52,523
I hear you got one you can't put your hand to.

630
00:56:52,613 --> 00:56:55,650
- What do you know about it?
- That's my business.

631
00:56:55,733 --> 00:56:59,203
I'm a tracker, and some say part hound dog.

632
00:57:00,533 --> 00:57:06,051
But when some dink busts outta the joint,
skips bail, I'm the one they call.

633
00:57:06,133 --> 00:57:08,169
Mister...

634
00:57:08,253 --> 00:57:13,452
I got the cops, state troopers,
Federal Bl, already lookin' for my boy.

635
00:57:13,533 --> 00:57:17,651
- Now ifyou got information...
- The cops won't find your boy.

636
00:57:17,733 --> 00:57:21,009
A cop couldn't find his butt
if he had a bell on it.

637
00:57:21,093 --> 00:57:24,608
You wanna find an outlaw,
you call an outlaw.

638
00:57:24,693 --> 00:57:27,969
You wanna find a Dunkin' Donuts, call a cop.

639
00:57:28,973 --> 00:57:32,648
Smalls, first off,
get your damn feet off my furniture.

640
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:38,607
Second off, it's widely known
I posted a 25-grand reward for my boy.

641
00:57:38,693 --> 00:57:41,287
Now ifyou can find him, claim it.

642
00:57:42,093 --> 00:57:45,165
Short ofthat, what have we got to talk about?

643
00:57:46,733 --> 00:57:49,327
Price. Fair price.

644
00:57:50,973 --> 00:57:55,330
That's not what you say it is.
That's what the market will bear.

645
00:57:55,613 --> 00:57:57,604
Simple economics.

646
00:57:57,693 --> 00:58:03,689
Now there are people - and, mind you, I know
'em - that'll pay a lot more than $25,000

647
00:58:03,773 --> 00:58:06,128
for a healthy baby.

648
00:58:06,213 --> 00:58:09,523
- What are you after?
- I'll give you an idea.

649
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:14,563
As a pup, I myselffetched
$30,000 on the black market.

650
00:58:14,653 --> 00:58:17,326
That was 1954 dollars.

651
00:58:17,413 --> 00:58:21,201
Now, for 50 grand, I'll track him

652
00:58:22,533 --> 00:58:24,125
and I'll find him.

653
00:58:28,253 --> 00:58:31,723
And the people that took him...
I'll kick their butts.

654
00:58:32,973 --> 00:58:34,565
No extra charge.

655
00:58:36,053 --> 00:58:40,092
- And if I don't pay?
- I'll get the boy regardless.

656
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:44,885
And ifyou don't pay, the market will.

657
00:58:46,093 --> 00:58:48,482
You wanna know what I think?

658
00:58:49,253 --> 00:58:51,847
I think you're an evil man.

659
00:58:52,973 --> 00:58:57,524
I think this is nothin' but a goddamn
screw job. I think it's a shakedown.

660
00:58:57,893 --> 00:59:00,327
I think you're the one that took Nathan Junior

661
00:59:00,413 --> 00:59:03,530
and I think you're the one
that's gonna get his butt kicked.

662
00:59:03,613 --> 00:59:06,366
I think I'm on the phone
to the cops right now...

663
00:59:10,373 --> 00:59:13,683
Up and at 'em, H l!
Today's the first day ofthe rest ofyour life.

664
00:59:13,773 --> 00:59:17,686
Already you're messin' it up.
Missis gonna be back from town soon.

665
00:59:17,773 --> 00:59:20,845
- Where's the baby?
- In the bedroom in his crib.

666
00:59:20,933 --> 00:59:23,925
He's sawin' toothpicks. He'll be fine.

667
00:59:28,213 --> 00:59:30,852
- You expectin' anyone?
- No.

668
00:59:36,333 --> 00:59:38,608
You two stay outta sight.

669
00:59:42,093 --> 00:59:45,165
- Mornin', Glen.
- I ain't comin' in, ifyou don't mind.

670
00:59:45,253 --> 00:59:47,164
I'll just keep my distance.

671
00:59:47,253 --> 00:59:50,165
- I didn't invite ya in, Glen.
- Don't even bother.

672
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:55,202
- First off, you're fired, and that's official.
- I kinda figured that, Glen.

673
00:59:55,293 --> 00:59:58,091
Well, that ain't the reason
I come out here. No, sir!

674
00:59:58,173 --> 01:00:01,563
No. You're in a whole
shitload oftrouble, my friend.

675
01:00:01,653 --> 01:00:05,646
- Why don't yajust calm down?
- Why don't you just make me?

676
01:00:05,973 --> 01:00:10,091
You know that little baby you got in there?
Remember? I know what his real name is!

677
01:00:10,173 --> 01:00:15,452
- You wanna keep your voice down, Glen?
- I'll pitch my voice wherever I please!

678
01:00:16,093 --> 01:00:22,043
His name ain't Hi Junior, it ain't Ed Junior,
but it's Junior, all right. It's Nathan Junior!

679
01:00:22,133 --> 01:00:24,601
You stay away from me, McDunnough!

680
01:00:25,773 --> 01:00:31,689
Yeah. You're an awful big man when you
got somethin' around to clobber a guy with!

681
01:00:31,773 --> 01:00:34,606
- I ain't a big man.
- That's right.

682
01:00:34,693 --> 01:00:37,082
And now you're at my mercy.

683
01:00:39,333 --> 01:00:42,689
I'm your worst nightmare.
I was gonna turn you in for the reward,

684
01:00:42,773 --> 01:00:46,368
but Dot wants somethin' to cuddle.
I guess we'll be callin' the baby

685
01:00:46,453 --> 01:00:48,762
Glen Junior from now on!

686
01:00:49,733 --> 01:00:52,531
I'll give you a day to break the news to Ed!

687
01:00:56,053 --> 01:00:58,487
Dot'll be around tomorrow to pick him up.

688
01:01:00,413 --> 01:01:02,643
Either that, or you go to jail.

689
01:01:04,333 --> 01:01:06,130
Say, that reminds me.

690
01:01:06,213 --> 01:01:11,606
You'll be gettin' a doctor bill in the mail
in a few days. I recommend you pay it!

691
01:01:32,333 --> 01:01:35,052
- What's goin' on here?
- It's just business.

692
01:01:35,133 --> 01:01:37,328
This'll go hard or easy, H l.

693
01:02:30,773 --> 01:02:33,162
Sweet Lord!

694
01:03:33,693 --> 01:03:36,651
# She'll be comin' round the mountain
when she comes

695
01:03:36,733 --> 01:03:38,212
# Oh, when she comes

696
01:03:38,293 --> 01:03:41,365
# She'll be comin' round the mountain
when she comes

697
01:03:41,453 --> 01:03:42,602
Good!

698
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:47,687
I know you're worried, but we're gonna get
him back. There ain't no question about that.

699
01:03:47,773 --> 01:03:50,606
We will. That's all there is to it.
And another thing...

700
01:03:50,693 --> 01:03:55,244
I'm gonna be a better person from here on
out. That's the way it's gonna be. It's official.

701
01:03:55,333 --> 01:03:57,722
You were right. A blind man could tell ya that.

702
01:03:57,813 --> 01:04:00,168
They won't hurt him.
They're in it for the score.

703
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:02,926
But I'm a changed man.
You were right, I was wrong.

704
01:04:03,013 --> 01:04:05,846
We got a family here.
I'm gonna start actin' responsibly.

705
01:04:05,933 --> 01:04:09,050
So let's go, honey.
Let's go get Nathan Junior!

706
01:04:09,813 --> 01:04:11,292
# All have chicken and dumplings

707
01:04:11,373 --> 01:04:15,127
# Yeah, we'll all have chicken
and dumplings when she comes

708
01:04:18,693 --> 01:04:20,684
I lurve to drive.

709
01:04:21,133 --> 01:04:24,842
- Boy, you sure said somethin' there, partner.
- Yes, sir.

710
01:04:24,933 --> 01:04:28,130
I figure between the ransom and this bank,

711
01:04:29,573 --> 01:04:33,202
you and I'll be sittin'
in the fabled catbird seat.

712
01:04:35,013 --> 01:04:37,004
Gale...

713
01:04:38,493 --> 01:04:41,053
Junior just had an accident.

714
01:04:41,653 --> 01:04:45,009
- What's that, partner?
- He had hisself a little ol' accident.

715
01:04:45,093 --> 01:04:49,371
- What do you mean? He looks OK.
- No, you see, movin' though we are,

716
01:04:49,453 --> 01:04:52,923
he just went and had hisself
a little old rest dump.

717
01:04:54,893 --> 01:04:56,884
Well, that's natural.

718
01:05:00,013 --> 01:05:02,004
- Gale?
- What now, little brother?

719
01:05:04,413 --> 01:05:06,404
He smiled at me.

720
01:05:09,493 --> 01:05:11,245
The kid smiled at me.

721
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:13,528
Come here, boy. Nice.

722
01:05:16,253 --> 01:05:21,452
- Do you know how to put these things on?
- Around the butt and up over the groin area.

723
01:05:22,133 --> 01:05:26,729
Shoot, I know where they go, old-timer. I just
wanna know whether I need pins or fasteners.

724
01:05:26,813 --> 01:05:33,161
Well, no. They got tapettes already on there.
It's self-contained and fairly explanatory.

725
01:05:37,173 --> 01:05:40,404
Balloons. Hey, these blow up
into funny shapes at all?

726
01:05:40,493 --> 01:05:42,563
Well, no, unless round is funny.

727
01:05:42,933 --> 01:05:44,924
I'll take these too.

728
01:05:47,213 --> 01:05:48,805
All right, now...

729
01:05:48,893 --> 01:05:51,532
Now you just lie down back there, old-timer.

730
01:05:51,613 --> 01:05:53,285
Yes, sir.

731
01:05:53,373 --> 01:05:57,685
All right, I want you to count up to... 825

732
01:05:57,773 --> 01:06:00,571
- and then on back down to zero.
- OK, then.

733
01:06:00,653 --> 01:06:04,362
I'm gonna come back in five
and check to see you ain't cheatin'.

734
01:06:05,813 --> 01:06:08,008
- Hurry up!
- He's a cheerful little critter

735
01:06:08,093 --> 01:06:11,802
- once he warms up to you.
- I don't know how high this one can count.

736
01:06:11,893 --> 01:06:14,646
Six Mississippi, seven Mississippi,

737
01:06:14,733 --> 01:06:17,406
eight Mississippi, nine Mississippi...

738
01:06:17,493 --> 01:06:20,371
Got some baby grub, baby wipes,

739
01:06:20,453 --> 01:06:23,968
got them diapers, them disposable kind.
I got me a packet of balloons.

740
01:06:24,053 --> 01:06:27,329
- They blow up into funny shapes at all?
- No, just circular.

741
01:06:27,413 --> 01:06:29,802
Say... where's Junior?

742
01:06:30,533 --> 01:06:33,764
- What do you mean? Didn't you put him in?
- No, I thought...

743
01:06:35,213 --> 01:06:37,204
Where'd we leave him?

744
01:06:53,653 --> 01:06:55,405
No!

745
01:07:18,053 --> 01:07:22,843
801 Mississippi, 800 Mississippi...

746
01:07:29,893 --> 01:07:31,884
Junior!

747
01:07:36,533 --> 01:07:40,128
791... Bullshit!

748
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:49,407
790 Mississippi...

749
01:07:54,773 --> 01:07:57,526
- 787 Mississippi...
- Baby! Baby!

750
01:07:57,613 --> 01:08:00,002
Baby! Baby!

751
01:08:02,093 --> 01:08:04,607
Promise we ain't ever gonna leave him, Gale.

752
01:08:04,693 --> 01:08:09,369
- Promise we ain't never gonna give him up.
- We ain't gonna give him up again, Evelle.

753
01:08:09,453 --> 01:08:11,603
He's our little Gale Junior now.

754
01:08:25,293 --> 01:08:27,284
Ed...

755
01:08:29,813 --> 01:08:36,207
I realise I can't be much
of a comfort to you now.

756
01:08:38,613 --> 01:08:40,808
But let me just say this:

757
01:08:42,533 --> 01:08:45,730
- You'll feel a whole lot better...
- I don't wanna feel better.

758
01:08:45,813 --> 01:08:49,123
- Honey...
- I don't care about myself any more.

759
01:08:49,213 --> 01:08:52,250
I don't care about us any more.

760
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:55,131
- I just want Nathan Junior back safe.
- I know that.

761
01:08:55,213 --> 01:08:58,444
If we don't get him back safe,
I don't wanna go on livin'.

762
01:08:58,533 --> 01:09:03,368
And even ifwe do get him back safe,
I don't wanna go on livin' with you.

763
01:09:11,853 --> 01:09:14,321
I guess I still love you, Hi.

764
01:09:15,413 --> 01:09:17,608
I... I know I do.

765
01:09:18,213 --> 01:09:20,090
I ain't even blamin' you.

766
01:09:20,173 --> 01:09:23,688
The whole thing was crazy
and the whole thing was my idea.

767
01:09:23,773 --> 01:09:28,369
- Well, factually, I myself bear a very large...
- Let me finish.

768
01:09:29,213 --> 01:09:34,685
Ever since those jailbirds took little Nathan,
I been thinkin' and I ain't too proud of myself.

769
01:09:34,773 --> 01:09:38,766
Even if Mrs Arizona had
more than she could handle,

770
01:09:39,773 --> 01:09:45,211
I was a police officer, sworn to uphold
the Constitution ofthe United States.

771
01:09:45,293 --> 01:09:49,445
- Now, honey, you resigned before we ever...
- That ain't the point, Hi.

772
01:09:49,533 --> 01:09:53,845
We don't deserve Nathan Junior
any more than those jailbirds do.

773
01:09:54,853 --> 01:09:59,005
- If I'm as selfish and irresponsible as you...
- You're not that bad.

774
01:09:59,093 --> 01:10:02,563
If I'm as bad as you,
what good are we to each other?

775
01:10:04,573 --> 01:10:07,167
You and me is just a fool's paradise.

776
01:10:54,773 --> 01:10:56,764
- There she is.
- Yep.

777
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:59,448
Well... Iet's do her.

778
01:11:00,453 --> 01:11:03,570
- What are we gonna do with Gale Junior?
- He stays here.

779
01:11:03,813 --> 01:11:07,726
Are you crazy? Supposin' we go
in there and get ourselves killed.

780
01:11:07,813 --> 01:11:10,691
It'd be hours before he was discovered.

781
01:11:12,053 --> 01:11:14,647
All right, you hayseeds, it's a stick-up!

782
01:11:14,733 --> 01:11:18,123
Everybody freeze!
Everybody down on the ground!

783
01:11:23,573 --> 01:11:25,643
Well, which is it, young feller?

784
01:11:25,733 --> 01:11:28,805
You want I should freeze
or get down on the ground?

785
01:11:28,893 --> 01:11:32,932
I mean to say, if I freeze, I can't rightly drop

786
01:11:33,293 --> 01:11:36,126
and, if I drop,
I'm gonna be in motion. You see?

787
01:11:36,213 --> 01:11:38,568
- Shut up!
- OK, then.

788
01:11:38,653 --> 01:11:42,248
- Everybody down on the ground!
- You can forget that part about freezin'.

789
01:11:42,333 --> 01:11:45,803
- That is till they get down there.
- Y'all hear that, don't ya?

790
01:11:45,893 --> 01:11:49,283
You wanna fill this up, partner? We gotta...

791
01:11:49,373 --> 01:11:51,648
Shit! Where did all the tellers go?

792
01:11:51,733 --> 01:11:53,724
We're down here, sir.

793
01:11:53,813 --> 01:11:57,203
They're over there on the ground
like you commanded, Gale.

794
01:11:57,293 --> 01:11:59,488
I told you not to use my damn name.

795
01:11:59,573 --> 01:12:02,770
Can't you even try
to keep from forgettin' that?

796
01:12:04,813 --> 01:12:06,804
Not even your code name?

797
01:12:08,133 --> 01:12:10,601
Oh, yeah, yeah. My code name.

798
01:12:10,693 --> 01:12:13,526
Y'all hear that? We're usin' code names.

799
01:12:13,613 --> 01:12:17,049
All right, everybody. We're about
ready to begin the robbery proper.

800
01:12:22,333 --> 01:12:24,369
Hurry up, you dang hayseed!

801
01:12:24,453 --> 01:12:27,923
All right, now y'all know how this here works.

802
01:12:28,013 --> 01:12:32,450
That hayseed over there
with the red hat, he's the monitor.

803
01:12:32,533 --> 01:12:34,524
OK, you betcha.

804
01:12:36,053 --> 01:12:39,762
I want you to stay flat for ten full minutes.

805
01:12:39,853 --> 01:12:44,165
We mightjust come back in five to check.
That's for us to know and for y'all to find out.

806
01:12:44,253 --> 01:12:47,848
Anyone found bipedal in five
wears his ass for a hat.

807
01:12:58,973 --> 01:13:03,364
That old-timer threw off my concentration.
Otherwise it would have gone smoother.

808
01:13:03,453 --> 01:13:08,402
Shoot, Gale. We done good.
This oughta split up real nice three ways.

809
01:13:11,933 --> 01:13:15,323
Goddammit, you never leave a man behind!

810
01:13:38,533 --> 01:13:40,569
- Where's the baby?
- Where's the baby?

811
01:13:40,653 --> 01:13:43,406
Dammit, H l, ain't we got
enough to contend with?

812
01:13:43,493 --> 01:13:48,692
I don't know, ma'am. I thought we left him
up on the roof. I think we left him at the bank.

813
01:13:48,773 --> 01:13:51,367
Ms McDunnough, I'm worried sick about him!

814
01:13:51,453 --> 01:13:54,206
- Hold on, H l.
- I'm worried sick about him!

815
01:13:54,293 --> 01:13:56,488
- Hi!
- H l!

816
01:13:56,573 --> 01:13:58,211
- Hi!
- Ms McDunnough!

817
01:13:58,293 --> 01:14:00,329
- Let us come with you!
- Please!

818
01:14:00,413 --> 01:14:02,483
He's our baby too!

819
01:14:30,533 --> 01:14:33,764
- What is he?
- Do you see him too?

820
01:15:50,453 --> 01:15:52,921
Gimme that baby!

821
01:15:53,333 --> 01:15:56,131
I want that baby!

822
01:15:57,533 --> 01:15:59,922
Gimme that baby, you warthog from hell!

823
01:16:20,933 --> 01:16:23,367
Just lay down on the floor, young missy.

824
01:16:43,093 --> 01:16:45,288
- Run along now, honey.
- But Hi...

825
01:16:46,893 --> 01:16:48,963
Just run along now.

826
01:18:14,893 --> 01:18:16,884
I... I didn't...

827
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:46,771
I'm sorry.

828
01:19:42,413 --> 01:19:44,608
What the hell's goin' on?

829
01:19:45,413 --> 01:19:47,608
Get away from there!

830
01:20:04,293 --> 01:20:08,889
- Let's go.
- Wait a minute. I ain't through with you.

831
01:20:10,133 --> 01:20:12,567
What are you doin'
creepin' around in the dark?

832
01:20:12,653 --> 01:20:15,213
- You in with Smalls?
- Excuse me?

833
01:20:15,293 --> 01:20:18,410
Leonard Smalls. Big feller. Rides a Harley.

834
01:20:19,413 --> 01:20:21,608
Dresses like a rock star.

835
01:20:22,573 --> 01:20:25,849
No, sir. That's who we saved him from.

836
01:20:27,373 --> 01:20:30,171
- It's a long story.
- Suppose you tell it.

837
01:20:30,253 --> 01:20:36,010
Well, sir, in a reward situation,
they usually say "no questions asked".

838
01:20:39,133 --> 01:20:41,727
- Do they?
- Yeah.

839
01:20:44,413 --> 01:20:46,404
Well...

840
01:20:47,853 --> 01:20:49,844
All right, boy.

841
01:20:51,653 --> 01:20:54,042
I guess you got a reward comin'.

842
01:20:55,573 --> 01:20:57,564
$25,000.

843
01:20:58,533 --> 01:21:04,642
Or, ifyou need home furnishings, I can
give you a line of credit at any of my stores.

844
01:21:04,733 --> 01:21:07,770
In fact, that's the way
I'd rather handle it, for tax reasons.

845
01:21:07,853 --> 01:21:11,402
We don't want no reward.
We didn't bring him back for money.

846
01:21:11,493 --> 01:21:13,688
We could work it that way too.

847
01:21:14,333 --> 01:21:17,882
Could I just look at him a little bit more?

848
01:21:19,693 --> 01:21:21,843
Be my guest, little lady.

849
01:21:24,573 --> 01:21:26,564
But...

850
01:21:26,973 --> 01:21:29,885
Would you mind tellin' me exactly how you...

851
01:21:38,453 --> 01:21:40,683
You took him, didn't you?

852
01:21:41,893 --> 01:21:44,168
It wasn't that biker at all.

853
01:21:44,253 --> 01:21:47,723
I took him, sir.
My wife had nothin' to do with it.

854
01:21:47,813 --> 01:21:50,964
- I crept in yon window and...
- We both did it.

855
01:21:51,053 --> 01:21:54,489
We didn't wanna hurt him any.
I just wanted to be a mama.

856
01:21:55,333 --> 01:21:57,324
It wasn't for money or nothin'.

857
01:21:57,413 --> 01:22:00,610
We just figured you had more
than you could handle baby-wise.

858
01:22:00,693 --> 01:22:04,971
But I'm the one committed the actual crime,
so ifyou need to call the authorities...

859
01:22:05,053 --> 01:22:08,568
Shut up. Nobody's gonna call
the authorities ifthere's no harm done.

860
01:22:08,653 --> 01:22:10,928
- Thank you, sir.
- Aw, bullshit.

861
01:22:11,653 --> 01:22:13,848
Just tell me why you did it.

862
01:22:16,493 --> 01:22:18,484
We...

863
01:22:19,373 --> 01:22:21,568
can't have one of our own.

864
01:22:26,013 --> 01:22:28,208
Well, look...

865
01:22:28,933 --> 01:22:32,243
If you can't have kids,
you just gotta keep tryin'

866
01:22:32,333 --> 01:22:37,123
and hope medical science catches
up with you, like Florence and me.

867
01:22:37,893 --> 01:22:40,088
It caught up with a vengeance.

868
01:22:40,933 --> 01:22:46,644
But, hell, even if it never does for you,
you still got each other.

869
01:22:47,933 --> 01:22:51,926
Sir, those are kind words, but...

870
01:22:52,613 --> 01:22:56,003
I think the wife and I are splittin' up.

871
01:22:56,573 --> 01:23:01,283
Her point is that we're both
kinda selfish and unrealistic,

872
01:23:01,813 --> 01:23:04,805
so we ain't too good for each other.

873
01:23:04,893 --> 01:23:10,126
Well, ma'am, I don't know much,
but I do know human beings.

874
01:23:11,573 --> 01:23:17,205
You brought back my boy,
so you must have your good points too.

875
01:23:20,813 --> 01:23:23,805
I sure hate to think of Florence leavin' me.

876
01:23:25,173 --> 01:23:28,802
I do... Iove her so.

877
01:23:38,213 --> 01:23:40,807
You can go out the way you came in.

878
01:23:41,373 --> 01:23:46,128
And before you go off and do
another foolish thing, like bustin' up,

879
01:23:47,213 --> 01:23:49,408
I suggest you sleep on it.

880
01:23:50,893 --> 01:23:52,292
At least one night.

881
01:23:55,093 --> 01:23:57,448
That nightlhada dream.

882
01:23:58,373 --> 01:24:01,171
I dreamtl was as lightas the ether,

883
01:24:02,493 --> 01:24:05,690
a floatin'spirit, visitin' things to come.

884
01:24:07,093 --> 01:24:12,690
The shades andshadows ofthe people
in mylife wrestled their wayinto myslumber.

885
01:24:14,533 --> 01:24:20,563
I dreamt that Gale andEvelle had decided to
return to prison. Probably that'sjustas well.

886
01:24:20,653 --> 01:24:25,443
I don'tmean to soundsuperior,
and they're a swell coupla guys,

887
01:24:26,173 --> 01:24:30,246
but maybe they weren'treadyyet
to come outinto the world.

888
01:24:31,853 --> 01:24:35,641
And then I dreamed on, into the future,

889
01:24:36,853 --> 01:24:42,962
to a Christmas morning in the Arizona home,
where Nathan Junior was openin'a present

890
01:24:43,053 --> 01:24:47,046
from a kindly couple
who preferred to remain unknown.

891
01:24:49,493 --> 01:24:52,326
I saw Glen a fewyears later,

892
01:24:52,413 --> 01:24:57,487
still havin'no luck gettin' the cops
to listen to his wild tales aboutme andEd.

893
01:24:59,613 --> 01:25:02,446
Maybe he threwin one Polackjoke too many.

894
01:25:03,493 --> 01:25:04,972
I don'tknow.

895
01:25:06,973 --> 01:25:09,123
But stiIll dreamed on,

896
01:25:09,973 --> 01:25:13,932
further into the future
than I'd ever dreamedbefore.

897
01:25:15,173 --> 01:25:18,370
Watchin' Nathan Junior's progress from afar,

898
01:25:19,453 --> 01:25:24,288
takin' pride in his accomplishments,
as ifhe were our own,

899
01:25:25,573 --> 01:25:28,451
wonderin' ifhe ever thought ofus,

900
01:25:29,493 --> 01:25:33,964
and hopin' thatmaybe we'd
broadened his horizons a little,

901
01:25:34,053 --> 01:25:38,205
even ifhe couldn'tremember
just how theygotbroadened.

902
01:25:39,813 --> 01:25:43,931
But stiIllhadn't dreamt
nothin' aboutme andEd,

903
01:25:44,013 --> 01:25:46,004
until the end.

904
01:25:46,853 --> 01:25:49,208
And this was cloudier,

905
01:25:49,293 --> 01:25:53,081
because it was years, years away.

906
01:25:55,373 --> 01:25:59,685
But lsawan old couple
bein' visitedby their children

907
01:25:59,773 --> 01:26:02,412
and all theirgrandchildren too.

908
01:26:03,333 --> 01:26:09,329
The old couple weren'tscrewed up,
and neither were theirkids or theirgrandkids.

909
01:26:10,053 --> 01:26:11,611
Dad...

910
01:26:11,693 --> 01:26:13,684
And I don'tknow.

911
01:26:14,413 --> 01:26:16,290
You tellme.

912
01:26:16,373 --> 01:26:18,364
This whole dream.

913
01:26:19,373 --> 01:26:21,364
Was it wishful thinkin'?

914
01:26:22,053 --> 01:26:27,047
Was ljustfleein'reality,
like lknowl'm liable to do?

915
01:26:28,533 --> 01:26:32,845
But me andEd, we can be good too.

916
01:26:34,453 --> 01:26:36,444
And itseemedreal.

917
01:26:37,893 --> 01:26:39,884
It seemedlike us.

918
01:26:40,373 --> 01:26:42,364
And itseemedlike,

919
01:26:43,093 --> 01:26:45,482
well... ourhome.

920
01:26:47,613 --> 01:26:52,004
IfnotArizona, then a landnot too faraway,

921
01:26:53,533 --> 01:26:57,321
where allparents are
strong and wise and capable

922
01:26:58,613 --> 01:27:01,810
and all the children are happyandbeloved.

923
01:27:03,493 --> 01:27:05,484
I don'tknow.

924
01:27:07,133 --> 01:27:09,328
Maybe it was Utah.
