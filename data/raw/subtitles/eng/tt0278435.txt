1
00:00:34,475 --> 00:00:35,999
Here you go. Thank you.

2
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,977
I'll be right back with your order.

3
00:00:41,749 --> 00:00:42,909
Good morning, Bill.

4
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:53,959
Let me guess. Pancakes, side of bacon.

5
00:00:54,462 --> 00:00:56,293
Who's dying? Come on, pick it up.

6
00:00:57,131 --> 00:00:59,497
Phil, Big Papa, please? I need 15.

7
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:01,999
I love it when you call me Big Papa.

8
00:01:04,038 --> 00:01:05,972
Hey, you're up early today.

9
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,841
Okay, you're good to go.

10
00:01:12,914 --> 00:01:14,245
Is this yours?

11
00:01:20,922 --> 00:01:22,480
Does that line ever work?

12
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,451
What's the problem here?

13
00:01:25,426 --> 00:01:26,654
It's hot!

14
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:36,234
Here you go.

15
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,567
Sorry.

16
00:01:46,347 --> 00:01:51,046
Why not? My grandfather was a lawyer.
Plus, I have a logical mind.

17
00:01:51,285 --> 00:01:56,120
And you're only, like, what?
$299,000 short of what you need for law school?

18
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,951
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of pie.

19
00:01:58,026 --> 00:02:00,893
Piece of ass. So what would you do?

20
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,498
- I don't know.
- Liar.

21
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:08,460
You know, I was thinking
I could go back to school full-time.

22
00:02:09,704 --> 00:02:12,832
And quit here? I won't allow it, Slim.

23
00:02:13,107 --> 00:02:15,075
- Careful, it's hot.
- Sorry, sir.

24
00:02:17,211 --> 00:02:20,112
- Ever try the Roc?
- What?

25
00:02:20,948 --> 00:02:24,941
It's the deodorant thing.
It's like salts or something.

26
00:02:25,887 --> 00:02:30,347
You rub it on your pits.
It looks like some kind of hippie crystal.

27
00:02:33,094 --> 00:02:35,289
- Are you saying I sweat?
- No, you just...

28
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,957
- Do I smell?
- No. God...

29
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:41,594
- Ladies?
- Okay. Your turn.

30
00:02:42,003 --> 00:02:43,368
I'm sweating too much.

31
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,703
You waiting for somebody?

32
00:02:56,317 --> 00:02:58,512
- Something to drink?
- Just water, thanks.

33
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,849
I'll give you a minute to look at the menu.

34
00:03:00,922 --> 00:03:04,153
That's okay. I was in here yesterday, Slim.

35
00:03:06,494 --> 00:03:08,724
- What's your real name?
- No.

36
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,965
I like it. Don't you think
it's kind of negative, though?

37
00:03:13,034 --> 00:03:14,763
No, I don't tell my name.

38
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:17,063
Okay.

39
00:03:17,438 --> 00:03:22,171
Give me the soup, turkey burger,
coleslaw, couple of extra slices of tomato.

40
00:03:22,343 --> 00:03:25,369
I write books. Do you read books?
What are you reading now?

41
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:32,650
You know Finnegans Wake by James Joyce?

42
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:36,182
My friend told me it's the hardest book
in the English language.

43
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:40,489
I mean, not the hardest,
but the hardest one that you can actually read.

44
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:44,823
I thought to myself, if I can get through it,
I could probably read the rest.

45
00:03:44,899 --> 00:03:47,231
- How long have you been reading it?
- Six years.

46
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,194
I'll be back with your soup.

47
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:54,103
- He likes you.
- He's a dick.

48
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,911
- He was in here yesterday, you know?
- I know.

49
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,849
Now he's back today, he brought a rose,
he pulls you into conversation.

50
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,885
Okay, so he likes me.

51
00:04:06,087 --> 00:04:09,853
- So, do you like him?
- I don't know him.

52
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:15,388
What's that got to do with anything?
He's a major piece of cake, piece of pie.

53
00:04:16,564 --> 00:04:19,089
Trust me, okay? He's carrot cake.

54
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:24,062
And when a guy like that,
who's actually cuter than you, likes you...

55
00:04:24,605 --> 00:04:25,970
He's cuter than me?

56
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,168
Face it, no one will ever go for you
because of your looks.

57
00:04:29,377 --> 00:04:32,244
That sucks, because my personality bites.

58
00:04:36,184 --> 00:04:37,674
Cup of soup.

59
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,756
You don't really write books, do you?

60
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:43,953
No.

61
00:04:44,091 --> 00:04:47,390
I haven't really been reading
Finnegans Wake either.

62
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,261
I'm going into law...

63
00:04:50,865 --> 00:04:51,991
...enforcement.

64
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,533
Who's the rose for?

65
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,000
Enjoy your grub.

66
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:02,198
Hey!

67
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:07,870
You.

68
00:05:14,088 --> 00:05:15,646
How much did you settle on?

69
00:05:17,925 --> 00:05:19,222
Excuse me?

70
00:05:19,927 --> 00:05:22,293
The bet. How much is it?

71
00:05:27,268 --> 00:05:30,032
You and your friend, yesterday, was it $200?

72
00:05:30,571 --> 00:05:32,971
Was it $500? What was it?

73
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:35,998
What?

74
00:05:37,778 --> 00:05:39,507
He bet his friend...

75
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:43,282
...that he could get into your pants
by noon tomorrow.

76
00:05:44,785 --> 00:05:47,219
Is this your business?
Are you the morals police?

77
00:05:48,823 --> 00:05:51,587
Take it easy, man. I was just having some fun.

78
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,620
What was it? $200 or $500?

79
00:05:57,131 --> 00:05:58,894
I want to know what I'm worth.

80
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,667
The bet was for $200.

81
00:06:02,803 --> 00:06:04,771
But now that I know you...

82
00:06:06,641 --> 00:06:07,972
...way too high.

83
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,572
Don't come back here again...

84
00:06:14,982 --> 00:06:15,949
...ever.

85
00:06:26,093 --> 00:06:27,890
I'm sorry to get in your business.

86
00:06:28,195 --> 00:06:29,526
No. Thanks.

87
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,199
I can't believe you actually said something.

88
00:06:33,901 --> 00:06:35,528
I'd have felt bad about it...

89
00:06:36,037 --> 00:06:37,527
...if I'd have kept quiet.

90
00:06:39,473 --> 00:06:40,872
Good luck.

91
00:07:21,282 --> 00:07:25,878
Please tell me, Phil, as Mitch was rather vague...

92
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:28,484
...is her father dead, too?

93
00:07:28,723 --> 00:07:32,682
Well, he is to her.
He left when she was maybe two or three.

94
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:38,025
- Then I'm happy to pay for the wedding.
- Yes, we're very happy.

95
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:41,868
You sure you love me?

96
00:07:44,105 --> 00:07:45,663
Forever and ever?

97
00:07:48,242 --> 00:07:49,766
You're safe with me, Slim.

98
00:07:50,578 --> 00:07:54,537
You're safe, and it's okay to be happy.
We deserve it.

99
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:03,784
- Wait, so this was during or after college?
- During.

100
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:08,285
What's wrong with you?

101
00:08:10,264 --> 00:08:13,199
No, I mean, why did you and Slim break up?

102
00:08:15,202 --> 00:08:16,829
I'm terrible in bed.

103
00:08:18,172 --> 00:08:21,505
Plus, she had to drop out,
some money problems...

104
00:08:21,575 --> 00:08:24,066
...and so we kind of evolved into being friends.

105
00:08:28,616 --> 00:08:30,243
What do you think?

106
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,819
Can I take you home right now?

107
00:08:42,196 --> 00:08:44,027
If you've got a sense of humor.

108
00:08:44,465 --> 00:08:46,524
My kids are out for tonight...

109
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,730
I live in Seattle.
Women always want the possibility of long-term.

110
00:08:51,272 --> 00:08:53,263
I didn't just propose.

111
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,271
I just thought that maybe we could...

112
00:08:56,343 --> 00:09:00,541
...have a brief,
totally unsatisfying sexual encounter.

113
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:03,514
I'm your guy.

114
00:09:09,723 --> 00:09:12,351
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

115
00:09:13,694 --> 00:09:16,959
...but I've got to get up at 5:00 in the morning
to buy green beans.

116
00:09:17,031 --> 00:09:18,191
Now...

117
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:22,668
...I know you don't need it,
but it's tradition in my family...

118
00:09:23,471 --> 00:09:26,804
...to give money to the groom.
- That's sweet.

119
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:32,037
Thank you, Phil.
And thank you for giving me away today.

120
00:09:32,746 --> 00:09:35,340
You're the best substitute father a girl ever had.

121
00:09:35,683 --> 00:09:37,947
No substitute. I'm the real thing.

122
00:09:40,588 --> 00:09:41,816
Thank you.

123
00:09:47,862 --> 00:09:49,227
He really loves you.

124
00:09:50,931 --> 00:09:52,091
Yeah.

125
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,463
You gonna give me babies, Slim?

126
00:09:57,938 --> 00:09:59,098
Yeah.

127
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,530
How soon?

128
00:10:03,444 --> 00:10:05,275
How soon can we get out of here?

129
00:10:12,753 --> 00:10:14,550
- Hi.
- Hello.

130
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,252
We've been driving around...

131
00:10:17,758 --> 00:10:21,751
...and my wife has fallen completely in love
with your house.

132
00:10:23,364 --> 00:10:24,991
Yes, it's great, isn't it?

133
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:29,560
We want to buy it. She wants it for our family.

134
00:10:33,407 --> 00:10:37,241
- Well, it's... We're not selling.
- Sure you are.

135
00:10:38,979 --> 00:10:40,310
That's the price.

136
00:10:42,082 --> 00:10:43,947
Don't worry, it's well over market.

137
00:10:47,955 --> 00:10:50,822
- You're out of your mind.
- I know, that's just it.

138
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:53,123
So before you say no again...

139
00:10:54,128 --> 00:10:57,655
...think how miserable one determined,
crazy person can make you.

140
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:02,526
Miserable today, tomorrow,
pretty much every day, until the day you sell.

141
00:11:04,471 --> 00:11:07,599
Your kids are grown,
you'll be happier in a smaller place.

142
00:11:28,662 --> 00:11:31,256
Parker, how are you? How's the jump shot?

143
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,862
Mitch!

144
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:36,425
- Not now, sweetie.
- It's Slim.

145
00:11:37,037 --> 00:11:38,698
Give me a second. Yeah?

146
00:11:39,974 --> 00:11:41,100
What?

147
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:47,408
Hey, Parker!
Parker, give me a ride to the hospital.

148
00:11:48,048 --> 00:11:49,515
Look after the client.

149
00:12:07,067 --> 00:12:09,399
She looks just like my baby pictures.

150
00:12:11,972 --> 00:12:13,200
Don't you?

151
00:12:19,847 --> 00:12:20,905
Who was that?

152
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:24,884
I don't know. Who cares?
Some construction thing.

153
00:12:25,452 --> 00:12:27,147
Bring her here. Let me see.

154
00:12:27,221 --> 00:12:29,951
That's my baby, that's my baby.

155
00:12:44,738 --> 00:12:46,069
What do you got there?

156
00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:51,137
Okay. Let's put it out here.

157
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,472
What's that one?

158
00:13:16,236 --> 00:13:17,225
Hey.

159
00:13:22,576 --> 00:13:23,565
Hey.

160
00:13:23,911 --> 00:13:25,435
Should I join you?

161
00:13:27,748 --> 00:13:29,340
No. I'm about to get out.

162
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:34,382
I'm just showering to wake myself up.
I got to go back to work.

163
00:13:35,823 --> 00:13:37,484
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

164
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,920
Me, too.

165
00:15:03,811 --> 00:15:05,870
Hi, darling. Where are you?

166
00:15:08,248 --> 00:15:10,443
You just paged my husband, right?

167
00:15:10,717 --> 00:15:12,048
Oh, my God.

168
00:15:12,653 --> 00:15:13,642
Mitch?

169
00:15:15,823 --> 00:15:17,586
Who are you? What's your name?

170
00:15:18,492 --> 00:15:20,050
I'm so sorry, l...

171
00:15:20,227 --> 00:15:22,752
No, it's too late to deny it now.

172
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,960
- Your name?
- I have to go.

173
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:29,897
Don't hang up. Don't be a coward.

174
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,032
Just tell me your name.

175
00:15:35,676 --> 00:15:38,110
That's the least you could do, don't you think?

176
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,876
I'm Darcelle. I'm very sorry.

177
00:16:38,805 --> 00:16:39,794
Hey.

178
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,807
She paged you.

179
00:16:48,282 --> 00:16:49,271
Who?

180
00:16:50,117 --> 00:16:51,812
Number 33. Darcelle.

181
00:16:58,358 --> 00:16:59,825
I guess you're late.

182
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,724
She's French?

183
00:17:08,702 --> 00:17:10,932
- She's not important.
- No?

184
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:13,099
- You're important.
- Yeah.

185
00:17:13,674 --> 00:17:15,107
And Gracie.

186
00:17:19,046 --> 00:17:20,775
I must be brain-dead.

187
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:25,177
I must be the biggest moron on the planet
because I thought we were happy.

188
00:17:25,452 --> 00:17:26,714
Were we happy?

189
00:17:27,554 --> 00:17:29,647
And I used to think we were so lucky.

190
00:17:30,724 --> 00:17:32,715
And I thought in bed we were still...

191
00:17:32,893 --> 00:17:34,884
- Slim, please.
- No.

192
00:17:35,462 --> 00:17:38,329
- You said I was safe with you.
- You are.

193
00:17:38,632 --> 00:17:40,896
You are. I promise.

194
00:17:43,704 --> 00:17:44,898
I'm sorry.

195
00:17:46,573 --> 00:17:49,235
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

196
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,979
Everything is going to be okay.

197
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:15,398
- I can smell her.
- What?

198
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,094
Her perfume.

199
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,270
- Darcelle, or whoever.
- We just had a drink.

200
00:18:22,342 --> 00:18:23,434
Stop it!

201
00:18:24,077 --> 00:18:28,673
You're caught! I caught you!
And you won't talk your way out of this.

202
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,611
How many, Mitch?

203
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,415
How many are there?
How many have there been?

204
00:18:37,691 --> 00:18:39,090
What does it matter?

205
00:18:41,928 --> 00:18:46,490
It's not that our sex life hasn't been good.
It's been great, Slim. But I'm a man.

206
00:18:47,534 --> 00:18:49,468
Men and women have different needs...

207
00:18:50,904 --> 00:18:52,804
...and that's okay. Darcelle's...

208
00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:58,135
She's willing to take care of that,
and maybe that's better for everybody.

209
00:18:58,445 --> 00:18:59,912
It's better for you!

210
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,107
You have a pretty good deal, don't you?

211
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:07,882
You go out, you fool around!
I sit here, take care of your house and kid.

212
00:19:08,622 --> 00:19:10,112
Well, no more, Mitch!

213
00:19:10,557 --> 00:19:12,525
That's it! The party is over!

214
00:19:12,592 --> 00:19:15,083
- Calm down.
- I won't do this anymore.

215
00:19:15,495 --> 00:19:19,261
I won't sit here and take it, and take it, and take it.

216
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,093
Sorry! I love you, yes.

217
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:26,905
But I am not a doormat!
I'm your wife. I'm your wife.

218
00:19:27,407 --> 00:19:31,070
And you cannot do this to me!
You cannot do this to me anymore.

219
00:19:37,451 --> 00:19:39,919
What? I can't hit you?

220
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:44,487
No, you can't.

221
00:19:51,031 --> 00:19:52,498
You want to fight?

222
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,965
I'm a man, honey, it's no contest.

223
00:19:56,136 --> 00:19:58,627
You have to understand, and I thought you did.

224
00:19:59,139 --> 00:20:03,701
I make the money here,
so I set the rules, right? It's my rules.

225
00:20:04,344 --> 00:20:05,675
You're with me?

226
00:20:07,481 --> 00:20:08,778
It's your rules.

227
00:20:09,616 --> 00:20:10,605
Yeah.

228
00:20:11,651 --> 00:20:14,882
- And what if I don't like the rules?
- Lf you don't like them?

229
00:20:16,556 --> 00:20:19,719
Come on, sweetie,
life isn't just stuff we like, is it?

230
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,492
We have to take the good with the bad.

231
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,927
That's what marriage is.

232
00:20:28,201 --> 00:20:32,797
So, for you, maybe today is a bad day.
Tomorrow may be great.

233
00:20:34,508 --> 00:20:36,373
Tomorrow will be great.

234
00:20:38,979 --> 00:20:39,968
Yeah.

235
00:20:41,715 --> 00:20:43,046
Today...

236
00:20:44,217 --> 00:20:46,913
...is the price you pay for having such a good life.

237
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:49,149
I'm going to go out.

238
00:20:53,093 --> 00:20:54,993
This will be better, don't you think?

239
00:20:55,061 --> 00:20:58,497
I don't have to sneak around
and pretend I'm going to work. I can say:

240
00:21:00,033 --> 00:21:03,594
"I'm going to Darcelle's.
I'll be back in a few hours."

241
00:21:17,851 --> 00:21:21,719
Just so you don't do anything later
you might regret. Okay?

242
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:11,935
Who are you calling?

243
00:22:14,474 --> 00:22:15,463
Your mother.

244
00:22:16,443 --> 00:22:17,842
What will you tell her?

245
00:22:18,612 --> 00:22:21,911
I was supposed to bring Gracie by tomorrow,
so I better cancel.

246
00:22:24,684 --> 00:22:26,743
You know, love is a scary thing.

247
00:22:27,921 --> 00:22:30,412
How powerful it is, what it does to you.

248
00:22:32,092 --> 00:22:33,787
That is what happened here.

249
00:22:35,262 --> 00:22:37,253
See, if I ever think of...

250
00:22:39,699 --> 00:22:41,462
I just... I can't...

251
00:22:42,202 --> 00:22:45,171
I refuse to live without you.

252
00:22:47,874 --> 00:22:50,274
I think you understand what I'm saying.

253
00:23:09,663 --> 00:23:11,631
Hey, you're late.

254
00:23:11,965 --> 00:23:15,799
Where have you been? You are late.
I was worried you weren't coming at all.

255
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,095
No Gracie?

256
00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:24,639
We will have a regular girls' luncheon...

257
00:23:24,711 --> 00:23:27,373
...and we will gossip about absolutely everybody.

258
00:23:34,821 --> 00:23:36,948
My poor baby. My God.

259
00:23:37,223 --> 00:23:38,713
Honey, I am so sorry.

260
00:23:44,831 --> 00:23:47,823
What did you do? What did you say to him?

261
00:23:52,072 --> 00:23:53,869
Men are like land mines.

262
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:58,007
Some you trigger the first week,
others it's years in.

263
00:23:58,178 --> 00:24:00,544
The problem is you want a man-man.

264
00:24:00,914 --> 00:24:05,715
Meaning his veins run thick with testosterone,
which is good.

265
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,116
But then he can turn around
without any warning and...

266
00:24:09,889 --> 00:24:10,878
...hit you.

267
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,121
I'm not this person.

268
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,854
I'm not a person whose husband beats her up.

269
00:24:18,164 --> 00:24:19,495
I know.

270
00:24:26,773 --> 00:24:28,400
What do I do?

271
00:24:30,543 --> 00:24:31,908
You got to go to the cops.

272
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:39,615
He's the father of my child, okay?
I will not put him in jail!

273
00:24:40,587 --> 00:24:42,179
Hold on. I'm sorry.

274
00:24:42,889 --> 00:24:46,791
I'm sorry, okay? Sit down. Relax for a second.

275
00:24:50,296 --> 00:24:54,699
I'm just saying that either you endure this...

276
00:24:54,768 --> 00:24:58,602
...and you live it out like you're
in some goddamn country western song...

277
00:24:58,838 --> 00:25:03,036
...or you take the kid,
you take Gracie and you get out.

278
00:25:11,818 --> 00:25:15,379
Mrs. Hiller, how are you? Your husband got her.

279
00:25:17,757 --> 00:25:18,985
I must've forgotten.

280
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:22,324
Gracie was totally psyched.
I told him he should do it more often.

281
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:38,900
Mitch!

282
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,675
Toots!

283
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,406
Gracie!

284
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:14,544
Is that my little croissant?

285
00:26:14,914 --> 00:26:16,575
No, it's your loaf of bread.

286
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:18,550
Oh, hi. How is it going?

287
00:26:20,887 --> 00:26:23,253
- Where are you?
- Zoo.

288
00:26:24,757 --> 00:26:28,022
- Why didn't you tell me...
- I called you at home, left messages.

289
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:29,450
Hey, Daddy.

290
00:26:29,996 --> 00:26:31,827
- Come here.
- It's your mom, honey.

291
00:26:31,898 --> 00:26:34,423
Mom, the elephants are peeing.

292
00:26:34,868 --> 00:26:36,392
She's a little excited.

293
00:26:36,936 --> 00:26:40,963
Hey, Dad, here. Come here. Look at the giraffe.

294
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:46,767
So, when are you guys going to be home?

295
00:26:47,046 --> 00:26:51,574
I don't know. I'll take her for a pony ride,
maybe get a cotton candy.

296
00:26:52,218 --> 00:26:54,152
You want a cotton candy, honey?

297
00:26:55,088 --> 00:26:56,919
- I'll see you later.
- 'Bye, Mommy.

298
00:27:06,232 --> 00:27:09,099
Made me nervous
when I couldn't reach you today.

299
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:17,268
I thought you were going to cancel
with my mother.

300
00:27:21,047 --> 00:27:24,107
And you have to go crying to the old gang
at the greasy spoon.

301
00:27:26,352 --> 00:27:28,047
Whatever happened to privacy?

302
00:27:29,923 --> 00:27:33,188
I guess it's dead, along with chivalry and fidelity.

303
00:27:35,261 --> 00:27:36,421
Tell me.

304
00:27:37,597 --> 00:27:39,155
Do you have any idea...

305
00:27:39,732 --> 00:27:41,393
...how bad things can get?

306
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,193
Educate me.

307
00:27:45,438 --> 00:27:49,499
Slim, I'm a determined man.
I was determined to have you, and I did.

308
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:53,378
This house, my company...

309
00:27:55,148 --> 00:27:58,311
I am and always will be a person
who gets what he wants.

310
00:28:02,455 --> 00:28:04,116
And I still want you.

311
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,828
You can either accept that...

312
00:28:10,363 --> 00:28:12,957
...or you can fight it.
Which way do you want to go?

313
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,229
I want to be happy.

314
00:28:22,775 --> 00:28:23,935
Good.

315
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,957
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

316
00:28:43,663 --> 00:28:46,655
I have a friend whose husband beats her up.

317
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,834
She should come in here and file a complaint.

318
00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:53,730
If she has physical evidence of abuse
on her person...

319
00:28:53,906 --> 00:28:55,635
...we'll go out and arrest him.

320
00:28:55,708 --> 00:28:59,644
- Lf he has money, he can bail himself out.
- That's true.

321
00:29:00,013 --> 00:29:03,813
- Then he's free till it goes to trial.
- Lf it goes to trial.

322
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:07,344
It's up to the city's attorney's office
whether to prosecute.

323
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,444
Okay, so...

324
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:11,719
...she comes in here, she has him arrested...

325
00:29:12,191 --> 00:29:14,386
...and pisses him off...

326
00:29:14,527 --> 00:29:18,156
...then there's no guarantee
that he won't come after her once he's out.

327
00:29:18,264 --> 00:29:20,027
She could get a protection order.

328
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:23,432
What's that? A little piece of paper
that says he can't come around?

329
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:28,001
And when he comes around,
what does she do, throw it at him?

330
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:30,033
She calls us.

331
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:35,709
And what about the kid? Is the...

332
00:29:36,449 --> 00:29:40,385
- Is the paper good for the kid, too?
- There's a child involved?

333
00:29:41,587 --> 00:29:43,919
That's a matter for the family courts.

334
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,221
But unless she can prove
that he's a danger to the child...

335
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,487
...she can't legally bar him access. Miss! Miss!

336
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:20,919
- Maybe she didn't hear the signal.
- No, she heard it.

337
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,009
No.

338
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,081
I think maybe Teddy is right.

339
00:32:05,565 --> 00:32:07,624
Maybe she could still be sleeping.

340
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,963
She's not sleeping, okay, Phil?
She's coming any second.

341
00:32:26,018 --> 00:32:27,781
Okay, do it again.

342
00:32:55,147 --> 00:32:56,307
Put her down.

343
00:32:57,483 --> 00:32:58,950
We should go in.

344
00:33:00,286 --> 00:33:02,277
It'd be crazy if we woke him up.

345
00:33:03,789 --> 00:33:06,724
Plus, she's going to flick the lights
if anything is wrong.

346
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:08,783
- Right?
- Yeah.

347
00:33:44,263 --> 00:33:46,060
Another step and you're dead.

348
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,604
Oh, my God!

349
00:33:56,609 --> 00:34:00,340
You don't understand.
You've broken into our house.

350
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,642
She's alive.

351
00:34:02,715 --> 00:34:06,481
The lights are out. I can't see who you are.
I could kill you free and clear.

352
00:34:06,652 --> 00:34:07,584
Sir, please.

353
00:34:11,123 --> 00:34:13,591
- Where's Gracie?
- She's here.

354
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:17,459
We are happy to leave, Mitch,
with Slim and Miss Gracie.

355
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:22,761
And make no mistake. If you keep them here,
we will go straight to the police...

356
00:34:23,135 --> 00:34:27,538
...who will surely arrest you
with a great deal of pleasure.

357
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:33,037
I don't want to say this in front of the group...

358
00:34:34,347 --> 00:34:37,214
...but you are just a rug head.

359
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:41,208
If you go to the cops,
it will be her word against mine.

360
00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:45,885
And they will find drugs in her bureau
or her car, or whatever.

361
00:34:46,192 --> 00:34:49,821
Trust me on that. I'll have custody of Gracie
by the end of the week.

362
00:34:50,329 --> 00:34:53,924
No. Help me. I got to get her out of here.

363
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,434
Enough with her. Get out.

364
00:34:59,271 --> 00:35:03,571
Wake up, baby. Wake up. Look at your papa.

365
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:07,373
We're going for a little ride. Look at your papa.

366
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,744
Help them up. Get the bag.

367
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:14,642
- Look at your papa.
- I'll see you soon.

368
00:35:15,921 --> 00:35:17,081
'Bye, sweetie.

369
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:26,427
And she's tied up because...

370
00:35:27,266 --> 00:35:31,362
...once a mean guy got her, tied her up...

371
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,097
Could be a broken rib.

372
00:35:33,305 --> 00:35:34,932
You could play with her ears.

373
00:35:35,641 --> 00:35:37,165
Flicks her ears out.

374
00:35:37,376 --> 00:35:39,310
At least it's not my face this time.

375
00:35:40,046 --> 00:35:41,172
Where are we going?

376
00:35:41,247 --> 00:35:42,874
- Hospital.
- No.

377
00:35:44,116 --> 00:35:46,084
- I'm fine.
- You are not.

378
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,819
- Where to, Phil?
- Hospital.

379
00:35:47,887 --> 00:35:52,551
I don't want to take her to the ER
in the middle of the night.

380
00:35:53,292 --> 00:35:56,557
She needs someplace safe where she can sleep.

381
00:35:56,629 --> 00:35:58,597
We could go to my house.

382
00:35:59,065 --> 00:36:01,033
No. He knows where you live.

383
00:36:02,668 --> 00:36:04,568
He knows where we all live.

384
00:36:05,571 --> 00:36:06,663
Yeah.

385
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:29,485
- One queen-size bed is all right?
- Yeah, it's just me and my daughter.

386
00:36:31,864 --> 00:36:36,267
I'm sorry. This card has been refused.
Would you like to try another?

387
00:36:48,981 --> 00:36:52,917
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hiller.
The funds in your account seem to be frozen.

388
00:37:04,296 --> 00:37:06,787
- I love motels.
- Me, too.

389
00:37:06,966 --> 00:37:09,526
- Hotels, too.
- Yeah, more potato.

390
00:37:10,469 --> 00:37:14,098
- I'm going to bounce on the bed.
- Okay, toots. Be careful.

391
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,538
- Hello.
- Hey, there.

392
00:37:18,911 --> 00:37:20,242
- Not too high.
- What?

393
00:37:20,312 --> 00:37:21,677
I'm talking to Gracie.

394
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:25,879
We're watching some TV,
getting ready to hit the sack.

395
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,710
Look, Mom.

396
00:37:29,722 --> 00:37:34,056
- What about what we talked about?
- No. No shelters.

397
00:37:35,327 --> 00:37:38,694
She hasn't been tainted by anything so far...

398
00:37:39,265 --> 00:37:43,634
...and I want to keep it that way.
- Okay. I understand.

399
00:37:43,702 --> 00:37:46,830
- Can we talk about this tomorrow?
- Piece of cake.

400
00:37:47,006 --> 00:37:48,940
Piece of pie. 'Bye.

401
00:37:52,178 --> 00:37:54,146
Come on, toots. Ready for bed.

402
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:59,312
What's "tainted"? Is that like "painted"?

403
00:38:04,757 --> 00:38:09,217
- Gin, I said tomorrow, okay?
- Not exactly the Biltmore, is it?

404
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:14,666
It's the information age, sweetheart.
You leave a trail everywhere.

405
00:38:14,767 --> 00:38:18,168
Especially when your best friend
rents your room with her credit card.

406
00:38:18,237 --> 00:38:21,968
I had to do that since someone froze
all my accounts, right?

407
00:38:22,308 --> 00:38:24,742
- We need to talk.
- No, we don't.

408
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:25,999
Please.

409
00:38:26,545 --> 00:38:29,105
If we do this the hard way,
you know who will suffer.

410
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:32,150
I'm not talking about you, honey.
I mean Gracie.

411
00:38:32,318 --> 00:38:36,448
You don't want her touched or affected
by something bad or undesirable.

412
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:39,013
- What?
- "Tainted," right?

413
00:38:45,798 --> 00:38:47,356
That's what tainted means.

414
00:38:58,777 --> 00:39:02,008
- Who's banging on the door?
- I don't know.

415
00:39:02,281 --> 00:39:03,976
Why? What's going on?

416
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:08,414
- Mom, I'm scared.
- It will be okay, baby.

417
00:39:22,067 --> 00:39:23,056
Slim!

418
00:39:28,274 --> 00:39:29,434
Hold the bus!

419
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:31,999
Hold the bus!

420
00:39:39,318 --> 00:39:40,785
Go, go, go!

421
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,652
Open the door. Open it.

422
00:39:57,569 --> 00:39:59,059
Los Angeles-Seattle?

423
00:39:59,138 --> 00:40:03,837
That fare is $409 round trip.
How would you like to pay for that?

424
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,338
Cash.

425
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:17,551
I always thought you'd come back here with me,
but not eight years later.

426
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:20,524
Well, if I had known how pretty it was...

427
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,758
This place really sparkles!

428
00:40:23,829 --> 00:40:26,491
You know what they call it? The Emerald City.

429
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:29,824
Isn't that where Dorothy is?

430
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:33,836
No, sweetie,
that's where Dorothy goes in her dream.

431
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,999
Where is she when she wakes up?

432
00:40:39,144 --> 00:40:40,634
Back in Kansas.

433
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,213
- All right, game time. Duck your heads.
- Pigeon poop.

434
00:41:06,305 --> 00:41:07,932
Why did you come to me?

435
00:41:09,308 --> 00:41:12,106
I tried to think of the last time that I felt safe.

436
00:41:13,879 --> 00:41:15,437
Then I saw your face.

437
00:41:18,584 --> 00:41:20,484
And, I wanted a place that...

438
00:41:21,387 --> 00:41:23,446
...M- L-T-C-H wouldn't think of.

439
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:27,087
- And someone who was stupid enough to do it.
- Yeah.

440
00:41:32,064 --> 00:41:34,532
- Anybody here like hot fudge sundaes?
- Yeah.

441
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,024
I do. I do.

442
00:41:58,457 --> 00:41:59,446
Yeah.

443
00:41:59,958 --> 00:42:03,325
- FBI. Can we talk?
- Go ahead.

444
00:42:03,495 --> 00:42:07,056
Would you mind opening up?
I'm investigating a kidnapping.

445
00:42:07,132 --> 00:42:08,724
I'd like to look around.

446
00:42:13,806 --> 00:42:15,034
You got a warrant?

447
00:42:26,251 --> 00:42:29,152
- You letting us in or not?
- Hold on a second.

448
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:39,029
Can I see the warrant?

449
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,276
Watch the front.

450
00:42:57,249 --> 00:42:58,682
Who are you looking for?

451
00:43:15,868 --> 00:43:18,962
Mister, unless you leave right now,
I'm calling the police.

452
00:43:19,204 --> 00:43:21,638
Jeez, that's a scary thought.

453
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,909
I married a cop.
I don't need their bullshit right now.

454
00:44:06,251 --> 00:44:09,015
That's enough. Do you hear me?
It's time to go. Now!

455
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:14,857
You're not FBl, okay. I know who hired you.

456
00:44:16,161 --> 00:44:19,153
Do you know what it's like
to have a knife hit your carotid?

457
00:44:19,231 --> 00:44:20,323
No.

458
00:44:21,934 --> 00:44:24,960
Do you know what it's like to die
because you're really stupid?

459
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,005
No, I really don't.

460
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:28,563
John boy.

461
00:44:29,474 --> 00:44:31,533
This is not listed on the program.

462
00:44:32,177 --> 00:44:34,077
They're not here. Let's ride.

463
00:44:34,146 --> 00:44:35,408
- Can't I just...
- No!

464
00:44:36,848 --> 00:44:38,543
Not today.

465
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,818
Your phone.

466
00:44:51,663 --> 00:44:52,960
'Night, John boy.

467
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:34,004
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I needed a shave anyway.

468
00:45:34,072 --> 00:45:35,130
I'm sorry.

469
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:38,133
- I shouldn't be here.
- Sure you should.

470
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:39,074
No.

471
00:45:39,578 --> 00:45:44,038
- I can't keep putting people I love in danger.
- What danger? They killed my sofa.

472
00:45:52,324 --> 00:45:54,952
- Hello.
- Joe. This is Mitch Hiller.

473
00:45:56,061 --> 00:45:57,050
It's him.

474
00:45:58,196 --> 00:46:01,131
Hello. How are you?

475
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,127
I assume Slim's called you?

476
00:46:05,103 --> 00:46:06,434
Yeah. Of course.

477
00:46:06,772 --> 00:46:08,569
Could you give her a message?

478
00:46:09,207 --> 00:46:12,074
- Lf she calls back again, I mean?
- I don't know.

479
00:46:12,678 --> 00:46:14,612
I'm on her side, not yours.

480
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,469
Her side.

481
00:46:17,249 --> 00:46:19,274
What did you expect, Mitch? Really?

482
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:22,211
Come on, Joe. You're a smart guy.

483
00:46:23,555 --> 00:46:25,546
Let me say two words to you, okay?

484
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:27,454
Lug nuts.

485
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:31,990
You don't want to worry they are loose
every time you pull on the freeway.

486
00:46:32,564 --> 00:46:35,829
How about the windows in your apartment?
Are they still locked?

487
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,929
Person could go crazy
thinking about stuff like that.

488
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:51,411
- You think those thugs are coming back?
- It doesn't make any difference.

489
00:46:51,483 --> 00:46:52,950
Sure it does.

490
00:46:53,585 --> 00:46:56,679
You don't have to go.
They're not coming back tonight.

491
00:46:57,322 --> 00:47:00,257
You know that it is not safe for you
if I stay here.

492
00:47:00,659 --> 00:47:05,187
You can come back any time.
Tomorrow, the next day.

493
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,597
Maybe I'll take you up on that one day.

494
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:15,502
Where will you go? What will you do?

495
00:47:31,423 --> 00:47:35,757
Jupiter, girl out there says she's your daughter.
She insists on seeing you.

496
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,268
She can't possibly be my daughter.
I haven't had sex since 1995.

497
00:47:45,771 --> 00:47:47,671
Not in this country, at least.

498
00:47:48,573 --> 00:47:50,734
Not her. Me.

499
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:53,034
I'm your daughter.

500
00:47:57,015 --> 00:48:00,712
- What year were you born?
- You are my father, Jupiter.

501
00:48:01,286 --> 00:48:05,450
I wrote you, like, 20 times.
But even when Mom died you didn't answer.

502
00:48:05,991 --> 00:48:10,291
- I didn't have enough money to bury her.
- Don't blame me. I didn't kill her.

503
00:48:10,962 --> 00:48:12,088
No. You had help.

504
00:48:13,331 --> 00:48:15,424
That's a stupid thing to say.

505
00:48:16,735 --> 00:48:18,862
What do you want? Money?

506
00:48:20,572 --> 00:48:22,631
I wanted Gracie to meet her grandpa.

507
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:26,699
Hi.

508
00:48:31,516 --> 00:48:34,041
And, yes, we need money to survive.

509
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,212
Look, sweetheart...

510
00:48:36,555 --> 00:48:40,491
...from 1968-1972, I had five kids. Maybe more.

511
00:48:41,393 --> 00:48:45,557
Half the people in that room could be my kid.
It's a running joke around here.

512
00:48:45,931 --> 00:48:50,231
How will you feel when you wake up one day
and find out your daughter is dead?

513
00:48:50,902 --> 00:48:52,767
And you didn't do anything to help?

514
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,706
You're good. The kid's a sweet touch, too.

515
00:48:58,543 --> 00:49:02,377
But you're not the first to think of this gig
since that Fortune article.

516
00:49:02,781 --> 00:49:06,410
So I'll give you the same thing
I gave the other three.

517
00:49:06,585 --> 00:49:11,147
$6. Enough to buy a sandwich.
But for you, I'll make it $12.

518
00:49:12,791 --> 00:49:14,986
Make sure you buy the kid a sandwich, too.

519
00:49:17,562 --> 00:49:21,157
I believe this originally belonged to you.

520
00:49:21,967 --> 00:49:25,459
Pawn it, since you're so hard up.
I'm sure it's worth more than $12.

521
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:54,360
Mommy, don't cry.

522
00:49:55,433 --> 00:49:56,764
Please don't cry.

523
00:50:24,296 --> 00:50:25,627
Mommy!

524
00:50:38,443 --> 00:50:39,774
This way.

525
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:58,288
I'm sorry. This is the best we can do.

526
00:50:58,463 --> 00:51:00,931
It's okay. We're fine. Thanks.

527
00:51:02,067 --> 00:51:03,967
Who are all these people?

528
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:10,802
They're kind of friends of friends of Phil.

529
00:51:21,553 --> 00:51:23,214
What is it?

530
00:51:25,056 --> 00:51:26,887
It's food, okay?

531
00:51:45,043 --> 00:51:47,511
Hi, I lost my birth certificate.

532
00:52:04,095 --> 00:52:06,325
This is for you. Phil sent it.

533
00:52:07,699 --> 00:52:09,894
Are you surprised?

534
00:52:10,835 --> 00:52:13,463
Sure, we take care of you. All right?

535
00:52:15,273 --> 00:52:16,570
Dear Slim:

536
00:52:17,442 --> 00:52:21,242
Yesterday three men threatened to kill me
if I helped you in any way.

537
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:25,346
Fortunately for you, this aroused my interest.

538
00:52:25,784 --> 00:52:27,149
But she may also be...

539
00:52:27,218 --> 00:52:30,585
I'm sending this to an old address,
the diner where you worked.

540
00:52:30,955 --> 00:52:33,685
If this reaches you and you need more...

541
00:52:33,925 --> 00:52:37,224
...leave word at my office. Jupiter.

542
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:29,209
What do we think? We like it here?

543
00:53:29,814 --> 00:53:33,875
- Why? Are we moving again?
- No. We just...

544
00:53:34,018 --> 00:53:35,144
Good.

545
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:39,350
Because I'm sick and tired to death of moving.

546
00:53:40,725 --> 00:53:42,590
Me, too. So here's the deal.

547
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:47,290
You can call me Mom or you can call me Erin,
but you cannot call me Slim.

548
00:53:48,166 --> 00:53:50,157
I never call you Slim.

549
00:53:50,468 --> 00:53:53,232
I know, but just in case
somebody asks you someday...

550
00:53:53,338 --> 00:53:55,306
I don't think you are that slim.

551
00:53:56,541 --> 00:53:57,838
Thanks a lot.

552
00:54:00,745 --> 00:54:04,943
- Do I get a new name, too?
- I guess. If you want one.

553
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:07,414
- Excuse me!
- Yes?

554
00:54:07,685 --> 00:54:09,846
- Hi. Betty?
- Yes?

555
00:54:10,255 --> 00:54:13,713
- I'm Erin Shleeter. I called you.
- Yes, I remember.

556
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,419
This is my daughter.

557
00:54:16,361 --> 00:54:19,558
Look at you. You are so... What's your name?

558
00:54:20,031 --> 00:54:21,362
Queen Elizabeth.

559
00:54:23,201 --> 00:54:26,864
Welcome, Queen Elizabeth.
You'll have a good time here.

560
00:54:26,938 --> 00:54:28,735
May I call you "Queen" for short?

561
00:54:30,775 --> 00:54:34,609
I like talking to Grandma, but every Sunday...

562
00:54:35,013 --> 00:54:38,779
...do we have to drive for 55 hours...

563
00:54:39,083 --> 00:54:41,847
...just to reach some phone booth?

564
00:54:43,054 --> 00:54:46,114
- Can I call Daddy this time?
- No.

565
00:54:46,191 --> 00:54:49,058
Please? Please?

566
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:51,056
Don't beg. You look like a dog.

567
00:54:56,034 --> 00:54:59,333
You know he has friends
in the police department...

568
00:54:59,404 --> 00:55:03,670
...and you're depriving him of his rights
as a father, nonsense like that.

569
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:06,436
It's leading up to a big custody hearing.

570
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:07,910
What are you saying?

571
00:55:07,979 --> 00:55:12,075
Talk to him. Calm him down.
Call him before he does something stupid.

572
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:14,778
It might help if he talked to Gracie...

573
00:55:15,286 --> 00:55:20,189
...for her sake, too.
It's not healthy to be without a father.

574
00:55:21,459 --> 00:55:24,155
We better keep this short. I'll call you next week.

575
00:55:24,229 --> 00:55:26,595
Wait. I want to speak to Gracie...

576
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:39,275
Hi, Daddy. We're having a great vacation.

577
00:55:39,577 --> 00:55:40,566
Where?

578
00:55:40,778 --> 00:55:44,270
We've been everywhere. Chicago and...

579
00:55:44,682 --> 00:55:47,150
No questions, okay? Or it ends now.

580
00:55:48,486 --> 00:55:52,752
Listen, bitch. She's my daughter, too.
Don't tell me how I can talk to her.

581
00:55:53,091 --> 00:55:56,754
Put me back on the phone with Gracie.
Give her the damn phone.

582
00:55:57,128 --> 00:55:59,790
Tell Daddy that you love him and say goodbye.

583
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,363
Gracie, you there, honey? Sweetheart, talk to me.

584
00:56:05,436 --> 00:56:06,368
'Bye, Daddy.

585
00:56:06,437 --> 00:56:09,770
Honey, I'm sorry, baby.
Daddy didn't mean to use bad words.

586
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:12,103
- I'm really, really sad.
- Graciel

587
00:56:16,547 --> 00:56:19,038
I'm sorry, kid. It was my mistake.

588
00:56:22,954 --> 00:56:24,819
Mommy's just a big dummy.

589
00:56:30,895 --> 00:56:32,123
What do you think?

590
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:38,428
- Her voice?
- Yeah, she sounds the same.

591
00:56:38,569 --> 00:56:41,697
Good. 'Cause if she's changed her appearance...

592
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:43,206
Thanks, John.

593
00:56:45,877 --> 00:56:49,176
I remember her. I told you.
The diner. The scam.

594
00:56:49,814 --> 00:56:53,306
I don't remember why you broke the rules
and decided to marry the bitch.

595
00:56:53,584 --> 00:56:55,142
She's not a bitch.

596
00:56:56,187 --> 00:56:57,313
Sorry.

597
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:00,680
She is a waitress.

598
00:57:02,327 --> 00:57:04,761
- What does that mean?
- Means she's stupid.

599
00:57:05,563 --> 00:57:08,555
- Call your mother. Now to call you.
- She's not stupid.

600
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:12,433
She thinks if the calls are short
they can't be traced.

601
00:57:12,503 --> 00:57:16,667
I still want to know.
With all the girls that we pulled that on, why her?

602
00:57:17,675 --> 00:57:19,006
Maybe it's love.

603
00:57:20,111 --> 00:57:21,043
Yeah.

604
00:57:21,112 --> 00:57:25,276
I know what that means.
If you were smart, you'd forget her.

605
00:57:25,416 --> 00:57:29,113
I can't simply forget her. She kidnapped my kid.

606
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:33,488
How many times do I have to go there?
It's not kidnapping.

607
00:57:34,525 --> 00:57:37,619
Kidnapping is when someone
who isn't the mother takes the kid.

608
00:57:37,695 --> 00:57:40,323
When the mother takes the kid,
it's called parenting.

609
00:57:40,465 --> 00:57:42,092
How soon can you get there?

610
00:57:43,301 --> 00:57:46,998
I don't know.
You know, I could lose my job for this.

611
00:57:47,372 --> 00:57:48,361
Robbie...

612
00:57:49,474 --> 00:57:53,934
...you could lose your job for all the jobs
you're doing besides doing your job.

613
00:57:54,479 --> 00:57:56,970
- You know what I mean?
- You got to be reasonable.

614
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:04,015
- I know some guys in Detroit.
- Like your guys in Seattle?

615
00:58:04,322 --> 00:58:06,517
I don't think so. I know what they're like.

616
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:08,886
They've never met her, never heard her voice.

617
00:58:09,327 --> 00:58:11,852
She'll spot them and run
before they even see her.

618
00:58:13,664 --> 00:58:15,097
It's you, Robbie.

619
00:58:16,167 --> 00:58:17,134
It's you...

620
00:58:18,236 --> 00:58:19,567
...or it's you.

621
00:58:24,108 --> 00:58:26,542
What do you think? Is it okay?

622
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:27,871
It's okay, right?

623
00:58:29,947 --> 00:58:31,676
No, it's not. It's horrible.

624
00:58:32,283 --> 00:58:34,513
It's not horrible, Mom.

625
00:58:34,685 --> 00:58:37,279
Yeah, but it's not good, is it?

626
00:58:37,488 --> 00:58:40,013
Mom, you tasted it.

627
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:04,347
You know what I think?

628
00:59:07,618 --> 00:59:08,949
No, what's that?

629
00:59:09,454 --> 00:59:11,718
I think you miss Daddy.

630
00:59:14,692 --> 00:59:16,387
Daddy yells at me, toots.

631
00:59:16,994 --> 00:59:19,588
Well, you miss somebody.

632
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:36,811
There he is.

633
00:59:37,815 --> 00:59:39,339
Joe! Joe!

634
00:59:39,584 --> 00:59:40,812
- Joe!
- Joe!

635
00:59:42,186 --> 00:59:44,484
Joe! Joe, over here!

636
00:59:46,524 --> 00:59:48,924
Hey! How are you?

637
00:59:53,064 --> 00:59:57,057
You're lucky I like you.
This is the most preposterous trip I've ever taken.

638
00:59:57,502 --> 00:59:59,561
Change your plane. Rent a car.

639
01:00:03,174 --> 01:00:04,163
Let's do it.

640
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:25,124
You guys hungry as I am?

641
01:00:42,213 --> 01:00:44,545
- Seems like she's doing great.
- Yeah.

642
01:00:45,449 --> 01:00:47,041
How about you? You okay?

643
01:00:47,385 --> 01:00:50,047
Cut off from everybody,
can't talk to your friends...

644
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:52,083
Gracie is safe.

645
01:00:54,325 --> 01:00:55,587
So Mitch is...

646
01:00:57,261 --> 01:01:00,128
- When is this custody thing?
- Couple of months.

647
01:01:01,899 --> 01:01:03,890
Anyway, they favor the mother, so...

648
01:01:05,603 --> 01:01:06,934
Yeah, they do.

649
01:01:07,572 --> 01:01:10,769
But he has a lot of money, and a lot of lawyers.

650
01:01:11,509 --> 01:01:15,445
That's kind of what I mean.
I mean, you can't run forever, Slim.

651
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:18,777
Why not? I'm good at it.

652
01:01:19,016 --> 01:01:22,952
You are. But, then again,
you're good at everything.

653
01:01:31,329 --> 01:01:36,062
Wait, I'm confused.
Are you criticizing me or flirting with me?

654
01:01:36,767 --> 01:01:38,564
Let me get back to you on that.

655
01:01:40,204 --> 01:01:43,696
- Hi, Gracie. Is that your ball?
- Yes.

656
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:48,268
You want to see a trick?

657
01:01:49,614 --> 01:01:50,740
Yeah.

658
01:01:53,684 --> 01:01:55,845
I don't hear the basketball. Do you?

659
01:01:57,388 --> 01:01:58,685
She was just...

660
01:01:59,657 --> 01:02:00,646
Gracie!

661
01:02:02,827 --> 01:02:03,816
Gracie!

662
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:07,895
Gracie! I mean, Queen!

663
01:02:08,399 --> 01:02:11,334
Mommy! Mommy! Watch my new trick!

664
01:02:14,372 --> 01:02:16,431
Didn't I tell you to stay close?

665
01:02:18,676 --> 01:02:19,665
Come on.

666
01:02:46,837 --> 01:02:48,771
Do you remember the house rules?

667
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:53,466
Who can forget, with Gracie here?

668
01:03:05,523 --> 01:03:06,512
Joe.

669
01:03:09,694 --> 01:03:11,992
- What would have happened if we...
- Don't.

670
01:03:14,432 --> 01:03:16,093
It's wrong to think like that.

671
01:03:17,268 --> 01:03:19,429
- Why?
- Because of Gracie.

672
01:03:20,905 --> 01:03:22,896
She's truly a great kid.

673
01:03:23,274 --> 01:03:26,334
Any path that doesn't include her
doesn't make any sense.

674
01:03:28,279 --> 01:03:30,611
Ginny told me about that weekend.

675
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:34,145
Of your wedding?

676
01:03:36,554 --> 01:03:38,579
Did she tell you how terrible I was?

677
01:03:38,723 --> 01:03:43,353
Joe, that might work with other people,
but you forget. I've had you.

678
01:03:45,329 --> 01:03:46,956
I didn't forget.

679
01:03:48,332 --> 01:03:51,665
And I'm telling you from experience...

680
01:03:53,104 --> 01:03:54,537
...you're not that bad.

681
01:03:59,777 --> 01:04:02,712
- Do you have to go tomorrow?
- Yeah.

682
01:04:03,414 --> 01:04:07,350
Why? Why can't you quit your job
and come here...

683
01:04:07,852 --> 01:04:11,379
...and play the horses,
and become independently wealthy?

684
01:04:13,791 --> 01:04:15,520
Please, kiss me, Slim.

685
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:18,589
I know we're not supposed to,
and it's against house rules.

686
01:04:18,662 --> 01:04:21,961
But for me to come all this way
and feel the way I do...

687
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:48,221
You're a great person, Slim.

688
01:04:49,627 --> 01:04:51,993
You're a great person. Just like your daughter.

689
01:05:13,851 --> 01:05:15,580
Can I get a chocolate kiss?

690
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:20,390
- Who wants to put two eggs in.
- I want to put the eggs.

691
01:05:21,725 --> 01:05:22,487
Careful.

692
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:19,296
I want you back.

693
01:08:20,537 --> 01:08:21,526
No.

694
01:08:21,605 --> 01:08:23,732
- It could be just like it was.
- No!

695
01:08:26,877 --> 01:08:29,243
That's pretty stupid. You know why?

696
01:08:30,748 --> 01:08:33,046
Because if I can't have you, nobody will.

697
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:39,881
Like that jerk who was here with you.
He'll be fishing for his guts.

698
01:08:40,591 --> 01:08:43,560
You know what else?
For murder, they need a body.

699
01:08:44,028 --> 01:08:46,462
Otherwise, they'll think you ran away again.

700
01:08:47,264 --> 01:08:49,357
Only this time, you'll never come back.

701
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:52,658
Mommy!

702
01:08:53,871 --> 01:08:55,600
Daddy, no!

703
01:08:55,806 --> 01:08:57,740
Stop, Daddy! Stop it!

704
01:08:58,308 --> 01:08:59,297
Mommy!

705
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:01,478
Stop, Daddy! Stop!

706
01:09:25,803 --> 01:09:29,739
Go on, honey. Get in your seat.
Get in the back. Strap yourself in.

707
01:10:02,606 --> 01:10:03,630
Put that on.

708
01:10:04,341 --> 01:10:05,865
Mommy, what's happening?

709
01:10:07,044 --> 01:10:09,171
Put it on. Put these on, too.

710
01:10:14,818 --> 01:10:15,580
You.

711
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:31,460
Car seat, honey.

712
01:10:32,136 --> 01:10:35,230
- Then slow so I can.
- I can't slow down right now.

713
01:11:20,450 --> 01:11:21,212
Bitch!

714
01:11:33,497 --> 01:11:34,429
Pull over.

715
01:11:35,599 --> 01:11:37,226
Pull the car over!

716
01:11:37,801 --> 01:11:39,291
Mommy, stop it!

717
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:41,030
Hold on tight.

718
01:11:44,474 --> 01:11:45,498
Pull over.

719
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:51,507
Shit!

720
01:11:58,121 --> 01:11:59,110
Come on.

721
01:12:01,558 --> 01:12:04,026
- Mommy!
- Hold on, Gracie, okay.

722
01:12:07,931 --> 01:12:08,920
Mommy!

723
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:16,601
Come on!

724
01:12:19,743 --> 01:12:23,270
It will be over soon. We're almost there!
Just hold on, okay?

725
01:13:29,212 --> 01:13:32,545
You'll be all right, okay? All right.

726
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:04,877
Okay, toots.

727
01:14:05,882 --> 01:14:07,076
Let's talk.

728
01:14:10,554 --> 01:14:12,681
You want me to tell you what happened?

729
01:14:14,091 --> 01:14:15,285
Fair enough.

730
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:17,358
First thing...

731
01:14:18,729 --> 01:14:20,094
...Erin is over.

732
01:14:20,864 --> 01:14:22,297
I liked Erin.

733
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:26,101
And you are not the Queen of England anymore.

734
01:14:27,637 --> 01:14:28,797
Okay?

735
01:14:35,579 --> 01:14:36,910
I'm hungry.

736
01:14:48,725 --> 01:14:51,125
- Is everything okay here?
- Yeah, thanks.

737
01:14:52,095 --> 01:14:54,620
Hey there, little cutie. What's your name?

738
01:14:55,399 --> 01:14:56,661
I don't know.

739
01:15:02,539 --> 01:15:04,973
Hey, Millie, 14 needs menus.

740
01:15:16,019 --> 01:15:17,213
Come on.

741
01:15:18,355 --> 01:15:22,416
You'll be okay? You're going to sit here,
be Mommy's good girl? Okay?

742
01:15:22,926 --> 01:15:26,089
All right. Don't talk to any strangers.
Be right back.

743
01:15:28,298 --> 01:15:30,493
- Is Mr. Toller with someone?
- No, but...

744
01:15:30,567 --> 01:15:33,229
Good. I'm not a crazy person. I swear.

745
01:15:33,303 --> 01:15:35,794
- Wait a minute. You can't...
- Don't call security.

746
01:15:35,872 --> 01:15:39,501
Hi, Mr. Toller. My name is Erin...
I mean, my name is Slim.

747
01:15:39,576 --> 01:15:43,979
I got your name from Millie.
Down at the diner, right down the block.

748
01:15:44,548 --> 01:15:46,106
The thing is...

749
01:15:46,716 --> 01:15:50,015
My husband keeps trying to kill me.
You know? See?

750
01:15:50,153 --> 01:15:53,247
I need someone to talk to who is smart.

751
01:15:53,490 --> 01:15:56,755
And I have money, you know.

752
01:15:57,694 --> 01:16:00,458
I have money. $500.

753
01:16:01,932 --> 01:16:05,197
And you can have it. You can have it all...

754
01:16:05,569 --> 01:16:07,730
...if you just listen to what...

755
01:16:09,139 --> 01:16:10,128
Two minutes.

756
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:13,371
Please.

757
01:16:21,885 --> 01:16:23,182
Thanks.

758
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:27,112
Small person. Can you watch her? Thank you.

759
01:16:31,194 --> 01:16:32,889
Pardon my French, dear, but...

760
01:16:33,597 --> 01:16:37,590
...I hope you got some pleasure from it
because you've really screwed yourself.

761
01:16:38,401 --> 01:16:41,928
You had two chances to go to the police,
file a complaint...

762
01:16:42,005 --> 01:16:43,996
...put his violence on record.

763
01:16:44,608 --> 01:16:45,973
You ignored them both.

764
01:16:46,776 --> 01:16:49,609
Which tells him to keep on coming
until he kills you.

765
01:16:50,947 --> 01:16:54,405
As for Gracie,
you're going to the custody hearing?

766
01:16:54,751 --> 01:16:55,547
Yes, sir.

767
01:16:55,785 --> 01:16:59,653
If you didn't, the judge would rule against you,
and you'd become a fugitive.

768
01:17:00,423 --> 01:17:04,985
Once you're there, your husband will,
as you say, portray you as a drug addict.

769
01:17:06,129 --> 01:17:09,462
For all I know, you are one.
You break in here uninvited.

770
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:15,033
I'd say your attacker has a very good chance
of gaining sole custody.

771
01:17:15,906 --> 01:17:18,875
- Lf you don't mind, put this away.
- No, no. Take it.

772
01:17:19,376 --> 01:17:20,968
Is that it?

773
01:17:24,414 --> 01:17:25,745
You won't help me?

774
01:17:26,583 --> 01:17:28,517
That's what I'm telling you.

775
01:17:29,419 --> 01:17:30,545
It's too late.

776
01:17:35,492 --> 01:17:37,926
There isn't anybody who can help you.

777
01:17:42,666 --> 01:17:45,191
In good conscience, I should say...

778
01:17:45,268 --> 01:17:47,566
...the custody hearing is probably a trick.

779
01:17:48,438 --> 01:17:51,464
It's not about itself. It's a way to find you.

780
01:17:52,409 --> 01:17:57,039
A way to get you in a particular place and time
so his men can follow you...

781
01:17:57,214 --> 01:18:00,081
...and he can come to wherever you are...

782
01:18:01,818 --> 01:18:03,251
...and kill you.

783
01:18:11,027 --> 01:18:12,153
Okay.

784
01:18:19,669 --> 01:18:21,899
Now I got to make you a promise, Grace.

785
01:18:23,707 --> 01:18:25,698
Ever since you were born...

786
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:31,313
One day I started thinking
of all the awful things that could happen.

787
01:18:32,849 --> 01:18:36,285
People who you'd love would die...

788
01:18:37,921 --> 01:18:40,287
...or leave you, or betray you...

789
01:18:42,559 --> 01:18:44,083
...and break your heart.

790
01:18:44,728 --> 01:18:47,390
Or a guy would hurt you in some way.

791
01:18:47,864 --> 01:18:50,230
And I thought to myself, if I could...

792
01:18:51,001 --> 01:18:53,731
...protect you from that, even once.

793
01:18:56,439 --> 01:18:57,872
If I could just...

794
01:18:59,409 --> 01:19:01,570
...absorb any of that myself.

795
01:19:16,793 --> 01:19:18,090
Here goes.

796
01:19:22,799 --> 01:19:26,326
Okay, you guys, keep up with me.
This is really busy here.

797
01:19:27,370 --> 01:19:29,497
Would you hold her hand, please?

798
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:34,038
This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever done.

799
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:38,374
- Oh, yeah? How about Horace?
- Okay, the second most.

800
01:19:38,915 --> 01:19:41,850
Rent a car, drive to Reno, then fly to San Jose.

801
01:19:42,886 --> 01:19:45,514
- Are you out of your mind?
- You noticed?

802
01:20:03,239 --> 01:20:04,228
Oh, my!

803
01:20:05,275 --> 01:20:08,676
What happened?
I thought I'm supposed to drive to Reno.

804
01:20:08,745 --> 01:20:10,804
I had to make sure you weren't followed.

805
01:20:11,881 --> 01:20:13,143
Okay.

806
01:20:13,917 --> 01:20:16,317
Hey, Graceland. How are you?

807
01:20:18,588 --> 01:20:20,317
Hey, Gracie! Over here!

808
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:26,226
- Here are the tickets.
- Okay.

809
01:20:26,429 --> 01:20:29,489
Some cash and credit cards. It's on me.

810
01:20:30,166 --> 01:20:33,727
- Just don't call home. Or Phil's.
- Okay.

811
01:20:34,804 --> 01:20:37,671
Think of it as a paid vacation you never had.

812
01:20:41,244 --> 01:20:42,677
Hey, toots.

813
01:20:42,979 --> 01:20:44,606
You want to give Mommy a hug?

814
01:20:45,815 --> 01:20:47,043
Come here.

815
01:20:49,285 --> 01:20:51,446
Say goodbye to me. Okay?

816
01:20:53,223 --> 01:20:56,158
I'm going to miss you. It's just for a little while.

817
01:20:58,361 --> 01:20:59,521
A little kiss?

818
01:21:00,864 --> 01:21:02,957
Can I have a little smile before you go?

819
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:07,392
Okay.

820
01:21:15,612 --> 01:21:17,910
Sweetie, why don't you sit up front, okay?

821
01:21:21,584 --> 01:21:23,051
Take care of her.

822
01:21:23,286 --> 01:21:24,776
Oh, honey.

823
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:29,691
I don't want you to worry, okay?

824
01:21:29,759 --> 01:21:33,525
Eric will have her dribbling behind her back
the next time you see her.

825
01:21:34,397 --> 01:21:38,128
Thanks. I'm number 1 on the auto dialer.

826
01:21:38,902 --> 01:21:40,563
Call me, or I'll call you.

827
01:21:40,937 --> 01:21:43,701
All calls, 15 seconds or less.

828
01:21:46,109 --> 01:21:48,270
- Cake?
- Pie.

829
01:21:51,481 --> 01:21:53,005
Try to have fun.

830
01:21:54,284 --> 01:21:55,751
Hey, how long?

831
01:21:55,819 --> 01:21:58,515
The custody hearing is in the next month, so...

832
01:21:59,155 --> 01:22:01,646
- That's my deadline.
- Deadline for what?

833
01:22:17,373 --> 01:22:19,898
Relax. Close your eyes.

834
01:22:21,211 --> 01:22:24,180
I'm not here. He's not here.

835
01:22:27,484 --> 01:22:28,678
Time!

836
01:22:29,085 --> 01:22:31,918
Relax. Breathe. Close your eyes.

837
01:22:32,255 --> 01:22:35,053
Close your eyes. That's it. Go!

838
01:22:38,862 --> 01:22:40,853
Relax. Keep your balance.

839
01:22:40,930 --> 01:22:43,091
- You ready?
- Yes.

840
01:22:43,733 --> 01:22:44,927
You sure?

841
01:22:47,804 --> 01:22:50,432
- Can you lose?
- No.

842
01:22:51,374 --> 01:22:53,899
- Can he hurt you?
- No.

843
01:22:54,344 --> 01:22:57,211
- Even though he's bigger?
- He's a lot bigger.

844
01:22:57,447 --> 01:23:00,939
- Even though he's stronger?
- He's a lot stronger.

845
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:07,080
Get some rest tonight.
Tomorrow we're gonna work on the ball.

846
01:23:12,195 --> 01:23:13,219
Look at me!

847
01:23:14,797 --> 01:23:16,458
- Lf he hits you...
- No way.

848
01:23:16,966 --> 01:23:17,990
Say it.

849
01:23:18,101 --> 01:23:21,935
It takes twice as much energy
to swing and miss as to swing and hit.

850
01:23:23,072 --> 01:23:26,633
You think you're done for.
He's got you by the throat. Left arm up.

851
01:23:27,010 --> 01:23:31,174
Good. Rotate around. Drop that arm.
Reach up, grab my hand.

852
01:23:31,247 --> 01:23:32,680
There. Good.

853
01:23:35,952 --> 01:23:37,214
So how do you win?

854
01:23:39,422 --> 01:23:40,548
How?

855
01:23:41,858 --> 01:23:43,257
I attack.

856
01:23:43,626 --> 01:23:47,255
- And what do you do after you attack?
- Nothing.

857
01:23:48,131 --> 01:23:49,428
Why nothing?

858
01:23:50,266 --> 01:23:52,427
Because I never stop attacking.

859
01:23:56,306 --> 01:23:57,398
Good! Do it!

860
01:23:57,473 --> 01:23:59,771
Use your legs. Keep that chin down!

861
01:24:00,476 --> 01:24:03,240
That's it! Go! Go!

862
01:24:06,649 --> 01:24:08,014
One last thing.

863
01:24:09,619 --> 01:24:11,211
The hardest lesson.

864
01:24:12,355 --> 01:24:14,755
We can't control the universe.

865
01:24:16,993 --> 01:24:18,483
Suddenly the maid enters.

866
01:24:18,561 --> 01:24:21,621
You're distracted for an instant and he hits you.

867
01:24:22,231 --> 01:24:23,664
That's not possible.

868
01:24:24,467 --> 01:24:28,426
To win, we must prepare,
even for the impossible.

869
01:24:29,572 --> 01:24:33,167
We bend the universe to our will,
but it will only go so far.

870
01:24:36,846 --> 01:24:38,837
- So you're saying...
- Yes.

871
01:24:44,153 --> 01:24:45,415
You're down.

872
01:24:46,522 --> 01:24:47,750
Lying there.

873
01:24:48,658 --> 01:24:50,125
Seemingly beaten.

874
01:24:53,863 --> 01:24:55,023
But hear me.

875
01:24:56,432 --> 01:24:57,831
Hold on to my voice.

876
01:25:00,003 --> 01:25:01,527
He's standing over you.

877
01:25:03,206 --> 01:25:04,730
He thinks he's won.

878
01:25:06,175 --> 01:25:09,702
And as sure as he's a coward,
he will try to kick you.

879
01:25:10,246 --> 01:25:11,372
Yes.

880
01:25:12,315 --> 01:25:14,510
But because you know what he'll do...

881
01:25:15,718 --> 01:25:17,879
...you're smiling inside.

882
01:25:25,895 --> 01:25:28,591
- How's that guy I set you up with?
- He's good.

883
01:25:29,399 --> 01:25:32,061
- He teach you how to think?
- I hope so.

884
01:25:33,903 --> 01:25:35,393
Did you find Mitch?

885
01:25:35,471 --> 01:25:38,531
He sold the house.
Bought a place out near the marina.

886
01:25:38,975 --> 01:25:42,877
I need a woman who looks like me.
5'5", 115 pounds.

887
01:25:42,945 --> 01:25:46,881
An off-duty cop or something.
She should have her hair cut short, too.

888
01:25:46,983 --> 01:25:49,975
- She should wear jeans and sneakers.
- Here's his address.

889
01:25:50,053 --> 01:25:52,521
I got her a room at the Washington Square Inn.

890
01:25:53,056 --> 01:25:54,148
What's she for?

891
01:25:54,223 --> 01:25:56,851
I need Mitch to think I'm here, in San Francisco.

892
01:25:57,393 --> 01:26:00,419
Have her meet me, 5:45,
top floor of the Vesuvio's.

893
01:26:00,663 --> 01:26:04,497
Today? Well, that's awful short notice.
I don't know...

894
01:26:04,567 --> 01:26:09,504
I thought Jupiter was almighty,
powerful, king of the gods.

895
01:26:13,009 --> 01:26:15,000
Yeah. One more thing.

896
01:26:15,578 --> 01:26:18,638
At some point,
not right now because it would be phony...

897
01:26:18,748 --> 01:26:20,909
...I need you to acknowledge I'm your kid.

898
01:26:31,394 --> 01:26:33,862
- You sure this will work?
- You bet your life.

899
01:26:36,165 --> 01:26:38,133
Thanks. I will.

900
01:26:39,402 --> 01:26:43,236
- And where is Gracie?
- Well, she gets back the day after tomorrow.

901
01:26:43,406 --> 01:26:45,271
And then we're gonna fly to LA.

902
01:26:45,441 --> 01:26:49,207
Tell me something, please.
Why is this call different?

903
01:26:49,378 --> 01:26:52,745
Well, you know, we were in the country then.

904
01:26:52,815 --> 01:26:55,807
Now we're in the city, meeting with my lawyers.

905
01:26:55,885 --> 01:26:58,376
So, you know, there's lots of cell phones here.

906
01:27:00,223 --> 01:27:02,521
So, there's no way they can trace this.

907
01:27:03,059 --> 01:27:05,357
Make sure you call me the minute you get back.

908
01:27:05,428 --> 01:27:07,487
I can't wait to see my girls, okay?

909
01:27:08,397 --> 01:27:10,388
Hey, give me the ball, man!

910
01:30:41,310 --> 01:30:45,212
- Coffee?
- No, I got to get home. Change for work.

911
01:30:46,349 --> 01:30:47,543
I'll call you.

912
01:30:49,485 --> 01:30:50,850
You want my number?

913
01:30:52,054 --> 01:30:53,214
Sure.

914
01:30:55,491 --> 01:30:58,324
- Thanks, for everything.
- You, too.

915
01:31:01,230 --> 01:31:02,891
I really appreciate it.

916
01:31:05,935 --> 01:31:07,027
Really.

917
01:31:14,143 --> 01:31:16,304
Lucy. Hey, baby.

918
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:19,772
No, I had to work late.

919
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:27,820
Tonight's no good. I have a flight
to San Francisco early tomorrow morning.

920
01:31:28,391 --> 01:31:30,757
If it was pleasure, you'd be going, too.

921
01:31:31,394 --> 01:31:34,124
No, I have to go up and pick up my daughter.

922
01:31:35,464 --> 01:31:37,694
Yeah, the custody hearing is down here.

923
01:31:38,034 --> 01:31:41,561
But it looks as if Gracie
is being taken to San Francisco...

924
01:31:42,705 --> 01:31:43,899
...and my wife...

925
01:31:43,973 --> 01:31:48,433
...it seems as if she has completely vanished.
Right off the face of the earth.

926
01:31:49,845 --> 01:31:52,040
I doubt they'll ever find her this time.

927
01:31:53,783 --> 01:31:58,015
I want her to meet you, too.
We'll call you as soon as we get back.

928
01:31:58,788 --> 01:32:00,153
Love you. 'Bye.

929
01:34:31,874 --> 01:34:34,399
- Hi. What's up?
- I'm in.

930
01:35:29,498 --> 01:35:32,092
Thanks for letting me come talk about Gracie.

931
01:35:32,434 --> 01:35:34,766
I'm glad you're willing to admit your temper.

932
01:35:35,037 --> 01:35:38,700
And let's not mince words.
The physical abuse you subjected me to.

933
01:35:39,241 --> 01:35:42,768
Perhaps with your new attitude,
we can really work something out.

934
01:35:43,412 --> 01:35:46,404
Per your last letter, I'll see you the evening of...

935
01:36:46,342 --> 01:36:48,503
Hey. You okay?

936
01:36:50,346 --> 01:36:51,335
Say it again.

937
01:36:52,181 --> 01:36:53,113
Say what?

938
01:36:53,849 --> 01:36:55,373
You know, what you told me.

939
01:36:56,752 --> 01:36:59,277
You have a divine, animal right...

940
01:36:59,588 --> 01:37:02,614
...to protect your own life
and the life of your offspring.

941
01:37:08,564 --> 01:37:09,826
Are you still there?

942
01:37:10,899 --> 01:37:11,888
Yeah.

943
01:37:13,535 --> 01:37:15,833
Stay on the line. I want to see if this works.

944
01:39:25,434 --> 01:39:26,731
It's me.

945
01:39:35,043 --> 01:39:36,032
Yeah.

946
01:39:37,312 --> 01:39:38,745
And this morning?

947
01:39:38,847 --> 01:39:41,407
You always did forget to turn off the coffee.

948
01:39:53,629 --> 01:39:55,460
I found it, Mitch.

949
01:40:31,266 --> 01:40:33,598
It's a machine. It knocks out cell phones.

950
01:40:50,185 --> 01:40:52,050
Found that gun, too.

951
01:40:54,623 --> 01:40:56,523
- Scared?
- Of what?

952
01:40:57,693 --> 01:40:59,684
Now is when you decide, Mitch.

953
01:41:00,929 --> 01:41:04,160
Whether you're a coward or not.
If you are, you can run.

954
01:41:04,499 --> 01:41:05,727
Go ahead, run.

955
01:41:05,867 --> 01:41:07,960
You will shoot me with my own gun?

956
01:41:08,737 --> 01:41:10,261
I threw them away.

957
01:41:12,307 --> 01:41:14,400
Then someone else is here with you.

958
01:41:16,411 --> 01:41:17,537
No.

959
01:41:19,448 --> 01:41:20,881
You're alone.

960
01:41:21,550 --> 01:41:22,812
Why not?

961
01:41:32,027 --> 01:41:33,995
This is what you wanted, right?

962
01:41:35,664 --> 01:41:38,030
What you were going to San Francisco for?

963
01:41:38,734 --> 01:41:40,326
The chance to get me alone?

964
01:41:41,003 --> 01:41:42,163
Yeah.

965
01:41:43,071 --> 01:41:44,663
But what are you doing?

966
01:41:49,311 --> 01:41:51,779
You want to fight me? Man to man?

967
01:41:53,115 --> 01:41:54,605
Woman, Mitch.

968
01:41:56,518 --> 01:41:59,009
Yeah, that's what I mean. Man against woman.

969
01:42:01,523 --> 01:42:03,457
You sure that's fair?

970
01:42:05,227 --> 01:42:06,489
Fair to whom?

971
01:42:09,364 --> 01:42:13,061
- No, I'm sorry. I can't do this.
- Can't do what?

972
01:42:13,301 --> 01:42:15,030
This. It's ridiculous.

973
01:42:15,937 --> 01:42:19,498
You could hit me before, though, couldn't you?
When I was defenseless.

974
01:42:23,979 --> 01:42:25,344
That's not going to...

975
01:42:30,252 --> 01:42:33,847
As I was saying, that's not going to do anything.

976
01:42:34,256 --> 01:42:35,723
Then what will do it?

977
01:42:35,991 --> 01:42:39,654
Are you such a coward that you can only hit me
when I'm not expecting it?

978
01:42:59,815 --> 01:43:00,577
Come on.

979
01:43:00,649 --> 01:43:03,243
I don't understand, Slim.
How does this work for you?

980
01:43:05,620 --> 01:43:07,781
I mean, this is carefully thought out.

981
01:43:08,523 --> 01:43:12,823
But say you do succeed. You beat me up
or whatever. You won't murder me.

982
01:43:16,965 --> 01:43:20,298
So all you've done is further piss me off.

983
01:43:27,542 --> 01:43:30,033
Self-defense is not murder.

984
01:43:32,013 --> 01:43:33,674
You don't have the guts.

985
01:43:40,155 --> 01:43:41,144
Come on.

986
01:43:41,690 --> 01:43:44,557
It's not self-defense
when you break in here and attack me.

987
01:43:44,626 --> 01:43:47,857
Attack you?
All I did was slap you around a little bit.

988
01:43:50,465 --> 01:43:53,662
You really think you're going to kill me
and get away with it?

989
01:43:57,639 --> 01:44:00,073
I told you. Self-defense.

990
01:44:01,109 --> 01:44:04,237
As arranged in our letters,
I'm here to talk about Gracie.

991
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:06,213
There are no letters.

992
01:44:06,281 --> 01:44:08,943
Sure there are.
In the drawer where your pistol was.

993
01:44:13,388 --> 01:44:15,583
You just put your prints all over them.

994
01:44:16,091 --> 01:44:18,787
You attacked me, I fought back.

995
01:44:19,995 --> 01:44:21,758
If something should happen...

996
01:44:28,270 --> 01:44:32,001
I don't care how long it takes.
I only have to hit you once.

997
01:44:32,674 --> 01:44:35,575
Just one good hit and it's over.

998
01:44:47,656 --> 01:44:48,645
He bleeds.

999
01:44:48,824 --> 01:44:50,655
You can count on one thing, baby.

1000
01:44:50,759 --> 01:44:54,058
Even if I don't kill you,
you'll never see Gracie again.

1001
01:44:54,496 --> 01:44:55,724
You never will.

1002
01:45:13,715 --> 01:45:16,377
I'm confused, Mitch. Aren't you a man?

1003
01:45:17,752 --> 01:45:19,549
Can't you hit me again, even once?

1004
01:45:36,671 --> 01:45:38,195
What do you think now?

1005
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:42,701
All your training, all your practice...
It's over, baby.

1006
01:45:42,944 --> 01:45:43,842
It's over.

1007
01:46:34,362 --> 01:46:36,296
- Hi.
- I can't do it, Gin.

1008
01:46:36,431 --> 01:46:38,331
What do you mean? What happened?

1009
01:46:39,234 --> 01:46:40,394
I can't do it.

1010
01:46:40,702 --> 01:46:42,932
He'll come after you and after Gracie.

1011
01:46:43,004 --> 01:46:46,235
I know all that, but I can't do it.

1012
01:46:47,275 --> 01:46:49,470
I'm not a killer, Gin.

1013
01:46:49,945 --> 01:46:52,914
I'm not him. I can't do this.

1014
01:46:54,683 --> 01:46:58,346
Hello? Slim, are you there?
Should I call the cops?

1015
01:46:58,653 --> 01:47:00,985
Slim, answer mel Sliml

1016
01:47:03,124 --> 01:47:04,989
Hold on to my voice.

1017
01:47:05,727 --> 01:47:07,388
He thinks he's won.

1018
01:47:08,196 --> 01:47:11,723
And as sure as he's a coward,
he will try to kick you.

1019
01:48:37,419 --> 01:48:39,546
Some woman called. Ginny?

1020
01:48:42,991 --> 01:48:44,288
He's still in there?

1021
01:48:46,294 --> 01:48:47,591
Armed?

1022
01:48:48,663 --> 01:48:50,062
Dangerous?

1023
01:49:01,509 --> 01:49:03,704
Looks like you're one of the lucky ones.

1024
01:49:49,891 --> 01:49:50,880
Gracie!

1025
01:49:53,328 --> 01:49:54,625
Mommy!

1026
01:50:02,770 --> 01:50:03,532
My baby!

1027
01:50:03,605 --> 01:50:06,096
Where are we going now, Mommy?

1028
01:50:06,307 --> 01:50:07,740
Anywhere you want to go.

1029
01:50:07,809 --> 01:50:09,504
Emerald City.

1030
01:50:10,478 --> 01:50:12,673
I was thinking the same thing.

1031
01:50:14,182 --> 01:50:18,619
- I have something to show you, Mommy.
- You do? Show me.

1032
01:50:20,722 --> 01:50:22,781
Something for you.

1033
01:50:27,295 --> 01:50:29,957
