1
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,348
<i>Ain't but one kind of blues.</i>

2
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:27,854
<i>And that consisted between</i>

3
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:31,555
<i>male and female that's in love.</i>

4
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:36,593
<i>In love, just like</i>
<i>I sung one of them songs a while ago</i>

5
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:40,867
<i>and I put a verse in there</i>
<i>saying that love hide all fault</i>

6
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:43,602
<i>and make you do things</i>
<i>you don't wanna do.</i>

7
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,271
<i>Love sometimes</i>
<i>will leave you feeling sad and blue.</i>

8
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,611
<i>I'm talking about the blues!</i>
<i>I ain't talking about monkey junk.</i>

9
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:54,813
<i>And it consisted</i>
<i>between male and female.</i>

10
00:00:54,921 --> 00:01:00,416
<i>And that means two people,</i>
<i>supposed to be in love</i>

11
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:03,155
<i>when one or the other</i>

12
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:08,227
<i>deceives the other through their love.</i>

13
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,461
Ronnie?

14
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,167
Are you okay? Baby?

15
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,940
Baby. Baby.

16
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:30,311
It's okay. It's okay.

17
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:34,045
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

18
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:35,979
<i>It's okay.</i>

19
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,923
I never laid a hand on her in anger.

20
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:46,325
Not one time, R.L.
Not even when I was drinking.

21
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:47,990
But this here business
got me wondering

22
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,092
what a good shake and slap
would do for her.

23
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,103
We gonna keep that talk
between us now.

24
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:53,934
Don't you go in there
with that shit on your tongue.

25
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,905
I ain't start this shit, R.L.

26
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,637
You wanna pray with me
before you go in, Laz?

27
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,119
Heavenly Father, we do not question
your divine plan for us,

28
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:13,715
but in these times,
when our spirit lies in shadow,

29
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:16,818
when we are lost,
we ask for your strength.

30
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,559
We ask for strength
to surpass all understanding.

31
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:24,068
In your name we pray. Amen.

32
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,739
Can't remember the last time
I saw you in that suit.

33
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,680
At your mamma's funeral.

34
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,179
I was a pallbearer, remember?

35
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:43,755
How about I get you folks some coffee
before I take your order?

36
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:46,518
We won't be staying long.
Coffee will be fine.

37
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:53,194
We leaving this weekend.
Deke got a friend in Mobile...

38
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,926
You gonna talk about that motherfucker,

39
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:56,626
I'm just gonna get up
and leave you sitting here

40
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,033
in that new shit he bought you.

41
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:00,105
I thought we was gonna be friendly
about this.

42
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:01,730
You sneaking around behind my back,

43
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,639
got everybody in town
looking at me like I'm a fool.

44
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,837
What's friendly about that?

45
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,048
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz.

46
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:13,812
Living with you, I feel it.
Like I'm one foot in the dirt.

47
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:17,823
Saw what happened to my mamma,
and that's not gonna happen to me.

48
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,482
I got living to do.

49
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,220
And you gonna do that living with him.

50
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,195
Look, Rose,

51
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:29,127
when folk get sick,
they do what they can

52
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,135
to get on the mend, get well.

53
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,466
Our marriage, it just done got sick.

54
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,371
Don't talk to me about sick!

55
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:39,205
I ain't been right
since I moved into that drafty house.

56
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:40,574
Keeps the heat on.

57
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,410
That damn, rusty radiator
about burned the skin off my legs.

58
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:46,280
- Kept us warm for 12 years.
- Laz, you can't say nothing that's...

59
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,616
Look, look, look.
Look, maybe we can do like R.L. Said,

60
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,814
come down to the church
and get with one of them counselors.

61
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,618
I don't love you no more.

62
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,995
I'm sorry you hurting.

63
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:03,126
I said my piece.

64
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,262
God forgive you
for what you done to me.

65
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:08,397
Let me go.

66
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,908
My daddy told me
a younger woman would bleed me dry,

67
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,136
and that's what you've done.

68
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:15,180
- Laz, I said let...
- You better pray, gal.

69
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:18,045
You hear me? You best pray.

70
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,244
Don't you lay a curse on me!

71
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,551
Yeah, go on, look.

72
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,591
See if I give a shit
about any of you people!

73
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,244
- You still want a lift?
- Yeah.

74
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,144
Transmission's shot.

75
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,385
Hey.

76
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:06,456
Make sure you go see my Aunt Lori.
You gotta get rid of that cough.

77
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,124
This ain't gonna work.

78
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:09,996
- Rae...
- I don't see why we gotta

79
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,128
pretend about it when you and I
both know it ain't gonna work.

80
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,297
- Rae, please don't do this, okay?
- It's stupid!

81
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,500
- Rae. Rae!
- It's so fucking stupid!

82
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:24,241
Look it. I got something for us, okay?

83
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,977
Give me your hand.

84
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,881
Give me your hand.

85
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,015
Look.

86
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:39,455
See?

87
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:44,196
Both these watches are gonna beep
at the same time, every night.

88
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:48,535
So no matter how far away we are,
we'll be thinking about each other.

89
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:50,866
Hey, look at me.

90
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,243
Look at me.

91
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:59,182
I gotta believe we can do this,
or I ain't gonna make it.

92
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,078
Okay.

93
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,981
God, I love you.

94
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,542
Ronnie, wait!

95
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,182
Ronnie!

96
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,258
Fuck.

97
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,260
No, no.

98
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,863
Hey, you got any money?

99
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,768
Thought you had a man for that.

100
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,738
I said we weren't gonna talk about him.

101
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,935
How many times
we done done this shit?

102
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,602
Look, I ain't calling you
no ho or nothing,

103
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,703
but I ain't gonna let you
play me like no trick, neither.

104
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:12,147
- Remember, you called me.
- Save it.

105
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:15,015
Save it for those dumb fuckers
you sell crack to.

106
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,087
How much money you need, ho?

107
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:20,681
The hell you call me?

108
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:27,230
You wanna get rough, huh?
Is that what you doing?

109
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,758
Tehronne. Tehronne, let me go.
Let me go!

110
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,173
Bye.

111
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:29,852
It's already noon, Rae.

112
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,486
You think them shorts
should still be on?

113
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:35,226
Well, if they weren't, you could
kiss my rebel cootch, you faggot.

114
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,701
Cough drops or condoms?

115
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,637
I didn't know you was working here.

116
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,008
Yeah, well, you know how it is.

117
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:56,316
I just love getting dressed up
in these goddamn blue vests.

118
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,455
Your meal ticket get shipped out today?

119
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,597
Just let me know
if I can be of any assistance.

120
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,434
Here you go, Linc.
Keep the change on that.

121
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:19,706
Thanks, Mr. Laz.

122
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:22,212
But if you wanna tip me,
best do it in butter beans.

123
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:23,975
Mamma wants a bag of yours.

124
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,347
"None of that store-bought junk."
That's what she said.

125
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,352
All right, you keep the change anyhow.

126
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,581
Come on out to the house,
I'll load you up.

127
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,918
Yes, sir.

128
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:40,382
Why y'all stop having dances
on Saturday night?

129
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,462
You used to have live bands
and all kind of shit.

130
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,257
Feels like a wake up in here now.

131
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:49,323
Folks can dance if they want.
I didn't buy that mirror ball for nothing.

132
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,960
Y'all seen my snakeskin shoes?

133
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,403
- They from New York.
- Yeah.

134
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,737
My niece,
she gets them on the computer.

135
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:59,709
- Is that right?
- They got blue snakes up north?

136
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,242
No. They got blue dye, though.

137
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,547
You think them boots on your feet
come from a black cow?

138
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:10,315
You wanna get on somebody
about live music?

139
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,151
Get on old Laz there.

140
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:15,284
He the one who got this joint shaking
back in the day.

141
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,328
You ain't gotta tell me.

142
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,056
Me and my girlfriends,

143
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:22,259
we used to talk about
how hard his fingertips get

144
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,666
just picking that guitar.

145
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,330
They hard from picking peas,
not strings.

146
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,168
And they still hard.

147
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:35,342
Mayella, it ain't never happened.
It damn sure ain't gonna happen tonight.

148
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,506
Oh, Laz, I know you hurting.

149
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,584
But you should know more than me,

150
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:43,519
ain't no better cure for the blues
than some good pussy.

151
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,633
Now that's a whole lot of woman
right there.

152
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:56,826
Yeah.

153
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,336
She sure do like to spread it around.

154
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,236
Hey, Laz.

155
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,910
Me and you friends and all,

156
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:10,448
but promise me
you'll keep your cool in my joint.

157
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:19,887
- I'm gonna finish my beer.
- All right then.

158
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,263
Mind if I sit?

159
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:36,867
Rose said that
it didn't go too well this afternoon.

160
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,871
See, I told her. I said, "Rose,

161
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:42,743
"we ain't leaving
till we make peace with Laz."

162
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:45,578
And that's the God's truth. I laid it down.

163
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,811
- You laid it down?
- I did.

164
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:49,887
That's funny.

165
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,124
You laying it down for my wife.

166
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,523
You think I wanna hurt you, Laz?

167
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,993
- Man, I'd take a bullet for you!
- Would you now?

168
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:01,396
We can put that to the test.

169
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,732
Say, Bo, would you still got that
little.22 over behind the bar?

170
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,829
My little brother here say
he'd take a bullet for me.

171
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,374
All right now, slow your roll now.

172
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:15,639
You come in here
to ease your heart, huh?

173
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,782
Well, I ain't gonna help you do that.

174
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,875
You took her into your bed,

175
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,579
now you got to lay in it.

176
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,121
I'll always love you, Laz.

177
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,528
Till the end of my days.

178
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,304
- Laz, what you doing, man?
- Laz, God damn it!

179
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,533
Cain slew Abel.

180
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,541
Slew him out of envy.

181
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:47,510
God put his mark on Cain for his sins.

182
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,776
Is that what you want, Deke?
Huh? Is that what you come here for?

183
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:54,876
I'll do it for you.
All you got to do is say it again.

184
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,179
Say you love me.

185
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,022
Say you love me, nigger!

186
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:28,516
- Ronnie ship out this morning?
- Yeah. He's so stupid.

187
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,587
Why do you think he's stupid?

188
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:32,384
He told me he don't want nothing to do
with no military career.

189
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:36,393
He wants to go up in Knoxville,
start an auto body shop with his uncle.

190
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,658
- I said, "Let's go! Let's do it now!"
- Really?

191
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:43,132
Shit, Ronnie knows cars.
Fixed that Buick for my Uncle Dale.

192
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:47,035
Then he starts talking all this shit
about honor and duty. I swear.

193
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,039
If he gets hurt up there,
I'm gonna kill him.

194
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:51,132
It's not like you're married.
He ain't even proposed.

195
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:52,540
He don't give a shit about me.

196
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:55,238
I begged him not to go.
I fucking begged him.

197
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,814
Oh, my God!

198
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,416
Hey, you all right?

199
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,893
- Yeah. I'm okay.
- You wanna go home?

200
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:14,454
No, it just gets worse there,
leaving me to my own head.

201
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,002
- Better?
- Yeah.

202
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,705
- Hey, Jess.
- Hey, Batson.

203
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,873
You Robotripping tonight?

204
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,110
No, but I will smoke that joint.

205
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,483
Well, check this out.
I got eight packs of DXM.

206
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:37,782
I got OxyContin.

207
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,587
I got a whole shitload of Coricidin
if you wanna get out-of-body and all.

208
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:44,423
Coricidin? You're just trying to get me
out of my clothes.

209
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,896
- I'll be right back, okay?
- All right.

210
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:52,904
- Hey.
- What you want?

211
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,165
Ain't no reason I can't go out
and have fun with my friends.

212
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,767
What, you think
I'm Ronnie's spy or something?

213
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,374
Come tomorrow, his dumb ass
gonna be halfway around the world

214
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:06,076
trying to keep his head
on his shoulders.

215
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,146
You think
he's gonna be thinking about you?

216
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,279
You go to hell.

217
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,021
Hey, how many to get me fucked up?

218
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:59,561
<i>Just like a bird without a feather</i>

219
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:07,836
<i>You know I'm lost without your love</i>

220
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:16,244
<i>Just like a bird without a feather</i>

221
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,887
<i>You know I'm lost without your love</i>

222
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,254
<i>You know I need your lovin'</i>

223
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:36,163
<i>Just like the angels need heaven above</i>

224
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,302
<i>Well, I done shot that woman</i>

225
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:52,811
<i>Shot her 'cause she done me wrong</i>

226
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:03,925
<i>Yeah, I love that woman</i>

227
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:08,829
<i>Says she ain't love no one but me</i>

228
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,173
<i>Yeah, but I caught that woman cheatin'</i>

229
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,811
<i>Now our home ain't where it used to be</i>

230
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,091
<i>Jess!</i>

231
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:48,301
Jess! Jess!

232
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,372
Stop!

233
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,875
- Stop! Stop!
- Stop what?

234
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,954
Stop. I'm spinning. Don't.

235
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,284
Oh, God, that feels so much better.

236
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,207
Come on, I'll take you home.

237
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:43,626
Thought you had
some shorts on earlier.

238
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,330
I got others.

239
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,690
This thing you got...

240
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:59,109
I've heard people say you'd fuck a tree
if it was handy. I can see that.

241
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:03,673
But that nigger, Tehronne?

242
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:10,048
He thinks he's some player

243
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:13,283
'cause he hustles dope
and stolen hubcaps, I mean,

244
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,826
I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?

245
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:18,360
I begged him not to go.

246
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,225
But he went.

247
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,028
I begged him.

248
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:24,966
I bet you did.

249
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,664
Just had to get
that black cock up in you.

250
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,082
That's not...

251
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:43,146
What the fuck you laughing at?

252
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,053
You ain't got a half
of what Tehronne got.

253
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,217
Not a half.

254
00:23:58,069 --> 00:23:59,229
Get up!

255
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,830
I ain't playing!

256
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:06,739
You gotta open your goddamn eyes!
God damn it!

257
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:19,189
Jesus Christ.

258
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:44,777
Hey, man, wake up.

259
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,870
- Lazarus.
<i>- Bojo called.</i>

260
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:21,143
Said you got to see your brother
at the long end of a broken bottle.

261
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:25,347
What, you call to preach me
about turning the other cheek now?

262
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:29,052
I think you did all right by God,
under the circumstances.

263
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:34,329
Your people are here for you, Laz.
This is your home.

264
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:36,900
<i>Ain't no shame</i>
<i>in showing your face around here.</i>

265
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:38,560
Yeah, all right.

266
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:41,898
Shit.

267
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,269
Oh, shit!

268
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:44,893
Little lady?

269
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:47,864
Little lady, listen to me. Miss.

270
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:51,299
Miss, now, I need you to open
your eyes for me, all right?

271
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:54,270
Come on now. Open your eyes.
Now, you can do that for me, can't you?

272
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:56,363
Come on. Come on.

273
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:58,305
There you go. Just like that.

274
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,502
That's good.

275
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,272
- Tehronne.
- Huh?

276
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:03,904
- Tehronne.
- Tehronne?

277
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:07,350
He did... He did... He didn't do this to...

278
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:11,688
It's all right.

279
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:17,827
I'm fixing to go to town and get
some medicines so I can fix you up.

280
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,989
You just rest, all right?

281
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:24,160
Just try to get some sleep.

282
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,095
Take that chill off of you.

283
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:30,335
God damn.

284
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:07,945
- Lazarus?
- Miss Angie. You gave me a start.

285
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:11,482
I'm sorry, it's these soft shoes
I wear for my back.

286
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,881
- You hurt your back?
- No, no, I'm standing most of my day.

287
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,885
They're just for support.

288
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:17,978
Didn't see you in church this morning.

289
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:21,718
Oh, I'm real busy with the crops.

290
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:25,523
And if I don't work on Sunday,
then I have to hire some extra hands.

291
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,224
Well, it's good to see you.

292
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,792
Look here, Miss Angela,

293
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:35,298
my little niece,
she got a real bad cough.

294
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:38,102
- You take her to a doctor?
- No.

295
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:41,178
She can't go...
Well, ain't no money for a doctor.

296
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,715
Her daddy off work
and he asked me to take care of her.

297
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,415
I don't... I don't know what to do.

298
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,978
You wait right here.

299
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:25,845
Is your niece older than 12?

300
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,078
Okay. My sister got a bad cough
with her pneumonia

301
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:30,620
so I just copied her prescription.

302
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,691
You don t need to pay anything.
Just take it.

303
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:36,555
And if she gets worse,
you give me a call.

304
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:38,629
I put my number on the bottle.

305
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,334
You ain't gonna get into no trouble
about this, is you?

306
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,232
Not if no one finds out.

307
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:06,351
Hey, Laz.
You know we closed on Sunday, man.

308
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:08,516
I need to talk to Tehronne.

309
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:10,324
Yo, T!

310
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:13,922
Laz wanna holla at you, man.

311
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,094
Come on back, Cuz.

312
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:21,600
You call it a game
when one man wins each time?

313
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,606
I call it a motherfucking shame.

314
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:29,445
- What you want?
- Can I get a word?

315
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:32,710
Come on.

316
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:44,752
- You want some weed?
- No, man, I don't mess with that stuff.

317
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:48,688
You know a white girl about yay high,

318
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,496
dirty blonde hair
split down the middle like?

319
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:53,593
That ain't up to me to hook you up, pop.

320
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,673
- She on her own, you know?
- Huh?

321
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,832
I don't pimp that.

322
00:32:57,942 --> 00:33:00,137
But if you talking about
who I think you talking about,

323
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:02,906
you talking about Rae. Rae Doole.

324
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:06,046
Sexy little split tail, like you say.

325
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:10,178
Can't hook you up with that.
But I do got two ho.

326
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:11,983
One of them ain't in town

327
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,957
and the other one pregnant,
so you on your own.

328
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:18,356
Well, this Rae, you get with her?

329
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:21,296
- Shit, man, who ain't fucked her?
- What you mean?

330
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:24,766
Man, she got a spare minute,
she snatch up anybody.

331
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:28,236
Sometime she needs the real deal,
so she calls me up.

332
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:31,966
Girl got a itch, you know?
What's a nigger to do?

333
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:37,503
Now this girl, Rae, she like it rough?

334
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:39,173
You know, like beating on her
or whatnot?

335
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:40,409
That ain't my scene.

336
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,213
- That something you into?
- No.

337
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,221
See, look, nigger, that girl's in my favor.

338
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:47,518
You fuck with her rough,
you got me to fuck with.

339
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:50,492
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Collar that dog, boy.

340
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:53,587
I don't wanna mess with her.
I just wanna know who she is, that's all.

341
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:57,532
Like I say, you wanna hook up with that,
I ain't in your way.

342
00:33:57,635 --> 00:34:00,570
That switch of hers
been all over town anyway.

343
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:03,538
- She got that sickness, you know?
- What sickness?

344
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:08,936
What I'm saying is,
she gotta get dick or she goes crazy.

345
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,040
Get my money ready, nigger.

346
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:18,447
Miss?

347
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,053
Miss Rae?

348
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,725
Hey! Hey, you hear me?

349
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,528
Come here. Come on.

350
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,264
Come on now. Hey.

351
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:35,633
Oh, shit! You burning up!

352
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,267
Hey, listen to me.
Look me in the eye now. Come on.

353
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:40,810
Look at me.

354
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,745
See, ain't no harm here. Ain't no harm.

355
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,816
All I wanna do is get you well.

356
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:49,950
My name is Lazarus. Lazarus Redd.

357
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:52,818
- Lazarus.
- That's right. My name is Lazarus.

358
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,482
- Lazarus Redd.
- Lazarus.

359
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,755
And I'm gonna take good care of you,
all right? Okay?

360
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:07,832
Lazarus! Lazarus!

361
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:09,967
Lazarus!

362
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,705
Get off me! Get off me!

363
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:19,014
See if I give a shit
about any of you people!

364
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:44,538
Lazarus! Lazarus!

365
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:47,244
Lazarus!

366
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:34,350
I know. I know it hurts. I know it hurts!

367
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:35,948
We gotta break that fever!

368
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,823
I ain't gonna let you die!

369
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:40,557
I ain't letting you die!

370
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:42,132
Now breathe.

371
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:45,431
Come on. Breathe now. Calm down.

372
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:50,533
There you go. You cooling off already.

373
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:54,773
Girl, you put the fear of the devil in me.

374
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:59,008
I was scared as a kid
on Halloween night in the graveyard.

375
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:23,266
Ronnie?

376
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:31,606
Ronnie?

377
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:36,920
Ronnie, where did you go?
Where did you go?

378
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,520
Where did you go?

379
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:43,327
Where did you go, Ronnie?
Where did you go?

380
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:46,489
Ronnie?

381
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:48,525
Ronnie?

382
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:53,261
Ronnie!

383
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,770
Ronnie!

384
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,467
Say, gal...

385
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:00,635
Hey.

386
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:03,876
Is you hearing the sound of my voice?

387
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,682
You traveling now, girl.

388
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:10,314
Why don't you come on back
in the house with me now?

389
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:12,013
Come on now.

390
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,215
Come on!

391
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,884
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey, you all right?

392
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:20,020
Whoa, whoa, whoa now.
Come on. Hey, hey.

393
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:27,897
It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.

394
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:30,064
Come on. Come on.

395
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,937
You all right. You all right.

396
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:46,223
It's all right now. It's okay.
Just rest, all right.

397
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:50,924
It's okay.

398
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:54,055
It's okay.

399
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,928
- Oh, no, no, no.
- It's okay.

400
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:59,761
Hey. Hey.
We ain't gonna do that, all right?

401
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:04,238
Here you go, Rae. You're safe now.

402
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:07,602
Listen. Listen. Listen here.

403
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:10,244
<i>I went</i>

404
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:14,373
<i>Down to the church house</i>

405
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:18,178
<i>I heard a voice</i>

406
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:21,353
<i>Tell me to pray</i>

407
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:25,285
<i>I got down on my knees</i>

408
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:28,961
<i>But I had no words to say</i>

409
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:32,427
<i>No words to say</i>

410
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:36,165
<i>You know I could not pray</i>

411
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:43,631
<i>If I, I was a catfish</i>

412
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:47,576
<i>Swimming, Lord, in the deep blue sea</i>

413
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:51,781
<i>I'd have all you big leg women</i>

414
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:53,941
<i>Fishing after me</i>

415
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:55,678
<i>Fishing after me</i>

416
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:03,687
<i>Well, there's two, two trains runnin'</i>

417
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:07,023
<i>They run, they run my way</i>

418
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:09,997
<i>You know one run 'round midnight</i>

419
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,660
<i>The other run just 'fore day,</i>
<i>just 'fore day</i>

420
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:16,338
<i>That train, Lord, took my baby away</i>

421
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:18,974
<i>Took my baby away</i>

422
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:17,063
Whoa, whoa, whoa, now.

423
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:20,332
Just take it easy. Don't go too fast.

424
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:22,939
How long I been out?

425
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,134
You been in and out, I don't know,
I guess two days.

426
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:28,237
Two days?

427
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:30,905
Well, you wake up in spells, you know.

428
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:33,950
Just long enough to get
some of this medicine in you.

429
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,077
Can you turn that shit off?

430
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,117
Oh, yeah.

431
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:48,297
Found you out by the side of the road.

432
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,630
Looked like somebody
took to beating on you pretty bad.

433
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,169
You know who done that to you?

434
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:56,796
- Where's Ronnie?
- I don't know who that is.

435
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:59,307
No, wait, wait. He left.

436
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:08,014
I don't got any money or anything,
you know, for fixing me up.

437
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:10,018
I don't need none.

438
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,350
I guess I best be on my way.

439
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:15,653
- I think we need to talk some.
- No, sir.

440
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:16,885
I gotta be on my way.

441
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:19,428
Best to get your wits about you before...

442
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:25,024
I wanted to tell you about that.

443
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,003
Why you got me chained?

444
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,339
What the fuck you been doing to me?

445
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,884
I ain't laid a hand on you,
except to break your fever.

446
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:44,216
- Like I said...
- Get this goddamn chain off me!

447
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:46,983
Look, girl, you been running wild on me!

448
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:49,582
Between them fits
and them fever dreams you having,

449
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:51,524
I been chasing you
all over this place at night.

450
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,063
Well, I'm woke now.
You can take this off.

451
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,364
No. You ain't right yet.

452
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,200
I'm right enough
to stand on my own two feet.

453
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,706
Now get this goddamn chain off me!

454
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:08,770
Why you let them mens
treat you like that?

455
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:11,072
What?

456
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:14,617
All them mens you up under,
why you let them do you like that?

457
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:19,579
What the hell you know about me?

458
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:22,783
You ain't got no right
to talk to me about that shit!

459
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:25,293
- Who the fuck do you think you are?
- I saved your life, girl!

460
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:28,194
I can do or say whatever the fuck I want!

461
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:32,859
Now, I done give you enough chain
so you can get around the house here.

462
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:35,962
You can get to the kitchen.
Bathroom, back yonder.

463
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:37,734
You got enough food around here.

464
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:40,833
A few more swallows left
in that medicine over there.

465
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:45,711
Whatever you want, you know,
if you wanna have me, you can take me.

466
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:50,549
I'll do whatever you like.
Just, when you're done, I gotta go.

467
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:54,112
You know?
'Cause I can't stay here with you.

468
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:57,523
God seen fit to put you in my path.

469
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:01,860
And I aim to cure you
of your wickedness.

470
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:08,738
- You some kind of pervert?
- No, ma'am.

471
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:11,239
Some crazy Jesus freak,
gonna fuck the spirit into me?

472
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:13,502
You watch your tongue in my house!

473
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,441
- Look it, mister...
- Now, you sick!

474
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,810
- You got a sickness!
- Look it, mister...

475
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:20,008
- We done broke the fever.
- I will do whatever you want.

476
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:22,312
Now, we gonna break the hold
the devil got on you!

477
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:24,751
I can't stay here! I can't stay here!

478
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:28,450
Help!

479
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:39,669
Somebody help me!

480
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:00,346
We ain't gonna be moved.

481
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:08,994
Listen here, gal.

482
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,099
I ain't gonna be moved on this.

483
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:16,233
Help!

484
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,171
Let me go!

485
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:24,543
You can holler all you want.
Ain't nobody gonna hear you.

486
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:26,741
Ain't gonna bend my will, neither.

487
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:28,682
Right or wrong,

488
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,054
you gonna mind me.

489
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:35,216
Like Jesus says, I'm gonna suffer you.

490
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:36,952
I'm gonna suffer you!

491
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:40,258
Get your ass back in my house!

492
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:45,729
Or what?

493
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:49,166
Or what?

494
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:16,700
- Quit it! It hurts!
- Now, whose doing is that?

495
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:18,065
- Quit it! It hurts!
- Now, whose doing is that?

496
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:30,537
God damn it! Okay!

497
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:42,122
You hungry?

498
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:57,271
I put a lot of backache
into growing them greens.

499
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:00,606
Some love into cooking the rest of it.

500
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:04,003
If you slow down,
you might taste some of it.

501
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,592
Oh, you like this?

502
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:27,169
Walking me through this field all day
like I was your mule?

503
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:29,398
Can't lay around on the sofa all day.

504
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:31,371
Gotta get your legs strong.

505
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:34,103
If I break one, you gonna shoot me?

506
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:56,728
My daddy was one of the first mens
in these parts

507
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:59,563
to start a soil conservation group.

508
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:03,970
They got a group of farmers together,
every year they rotate the crops.

509
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:06,806
Know why they do that?

510
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:09,743
Keep the soil healthy.

511
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:13,380
- That sting?
- Itches.

512
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:15,348
That mean it's healing.

513
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:23,025
Now, I done seen it in nature
and I done seen it in men.

514
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:27,820
You gots to change, rotate the crop.

515
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:30,832
Gotta have change,
else that seed won't take.

516
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:33,164
Hell, girl, you gotta cut that shit out.

517
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:35,397
Laying up under all them fools,

518
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:37,700
rutting on you
like you some bitch in heat,

519
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,435
like you somebody's dog.

520
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:44,537
A man or woman
that enters into union with Almighty God

521
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,240
in the sanctity of marriage,

522
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:50,047
should not demean theyselves
by bending to another's will.

523
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,984
Hell, girl, is you crazy?

524
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:55,115
I ain't no saint. I ain't saying I ain't weak.

525
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:58,786
I mean, playing guitar
in them blood-bucket jukes all your life,

526
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:00,192
a nigger learn how to sin.

527
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:03,323
And I do got sin in me.
I ain't gonna lie about that.

528
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:05,128
But I got respect!

529
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:07,931
And all you got in you is bile!
Just bile!

530
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:10,973
Running around behind my back,
whoring with my brother!

531
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:13,042
- Killing my baby!
- Get off!

532
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:33,394
I didn't mean to go off like that.

533
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:38,663
Why you old men gotta talk so much?

534
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:41,397
You gotta talk yourself into fucking me?

535
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:43,097
Like little boys.

536
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:47,543
It's okay. I'm grown. I know.

537
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:50,136
We can go slow.

538
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:55,314
You gonna give me another bath?

539
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,206
Well, Archie, there goes our fortune.

540
00:52:59,308 --> 00:53:02,368
Laz, we've been doing good
since you been away.

541
00:53:05,247 --> 00:53:07,442
What time Ella Mae's open up?

542
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:09,984
You needing to buy some pantyhose?

543
00:53:10,953 --> 00:53:13,046
Couple of dresses, actually.

544
00:53:33,242 --> 00:53:36,507
- May I help you, sir?
- Yessum.

545
00:53:36,612 --> 00:53:40,207
I'm looking to get some things
for a woman.

546
00:53:40,316 --> 00:53:44,878
You know, some dresses and such
and maybe some shoes.

547
00:53:44,987 --> 00:53:49,151
But they gotta be nice things,
you know, proper things for a woman.

548
00:53:49,258 --> 00:53:52,421
You know, things that make a woman
feel like a woman

549
00:53:52,528 --> 00:53:55,861
and not look like a hussy or a floozy.

550
00:53:57,466 --> 00:53:59,832
Well, that makes it easier.

551
00:54:16,385 --> 00:54:17,647
Hello?

552
00:54:19,288 --> 00:54:20,380
Hey!

553
00:54:22,491 --> 00:54:23,719
Asshole.

554
00:54:58,661 --> 00:55:01,289
I just wanted to bring something
to show my appreciation.

555
00:55:01,397 --> 00:55:04,264
Some squash, tomatoes,
corn, butter beans.

556
00:55:04,366 --> 00:55:05,993
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

557
00:55:06,101 --> 00:55:08,865
Well, my niece is all better now,
thanks to you.

558
00:55:08,971 --> 00:55:11,064
That's good. I'm happy to hear it.

559
00:55:11,173 --> 00:55:14,233
Oh, and I put something special in here.

560
00:55:15,077 --> 00:55:17,773
This whipped body cream.
Got a scent to it.

561
00:55:21,083 --> 00:55:23,313
That there is ginger soufflé.

562
00:55:23,419 --> 00:55:28,015
Say, you put it on
after a hot bath or shower,

563
00:55:28,123 --> 00:55:31,251
it'll make you soft, smell good.

564
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,385
That's real sweet of you.

565
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,987
Just hope you enjoy it.

566
00:55:36,098 --> 00:55:37,463
Thank you.

567
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:49,336
Mr. Lazarus!

568
00:55:52,781 --> 00:55:54,078
Hey, Mr. Laz!

569
00:55:58,587 --> 00:56:00,646
I come for the butter beans!

570
00:56:09,932 --> 00:56:11,160
Mr. Laz?

571
00:56:41,463 --> 00:56:43,021
Mr. Laz, you in there?

572
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,254
Mr. Laz!

573
00:57:47,529 --> 00:57:49,292
I'm coming inside!

574
00:58:25,467 --> 00:58:27,128
There now! Hush up!

575
00:58:36,745 --> 00:58:40,181
God damn! Girl, I can't leave you alone
for a minute!

576
00:58:40,282 --> 00:58:42,682
Get your ass away from around here!

577
00:58:45,954 --> 00:58:47,819
Lincoln. Lincoln!

578
00:58:57,399 --> 00:58:59,993
Was that Lincoln James
I seen running off?

579
00:59:02,571 --> 00:59:04,334
Why his britches down
around his knees?

580
00:59:05,741 --> 00:59:07,299
R. <i>L.,</i> you gonna have to get on.

581
00:59:08,744 --> 00:59:10,939
Can't have nobody around my place.

582
00:59:11,046 --> 00:59:12,980
You get a call from Rose?

583
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:14,572
This ain't got nothing to do
with that woman.

584
00:59:14,683 --> 00:59:16,878
I just don't wanna be bothered
with nobody right now.

585
00:59:16,985 --> 00:59:20,716
Something wrong with your phone?
I been trying to call you for a few days.

586
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:22,484
Going dove hunting?

587
00:59:22,591 --> 00:59:26,118
R. <i>L.,</i> now I done told you to get on.
I ain't playing.

588
00:59:32,134 --> 00:59:34,932
You saying that gun is for me if I don't.

589
00:59:35,037 --> 00:59:38,200
I ain't letting you
talk me out of shit no more, R.L.

590
00:59:38,307 --> 00:59:41,243
I done made up my mind on this,
I ain't gonna be moved.

591
00:59:41,276 --> 00:59:41,504
I done made up my mind on this,
I ain't gonna be moved.

592
00:59:42,578 --> 00:59:43,602
"Ain't gonna be moved."

593
00:59:43,712 --> 00:59:46,078
There ain't no room
for preaching around here no more!

594
00:59:46,181 --> 00:59:47,739
Now, I done told you to get on!

595
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:49,477
- Or what?
- Go on now!

596
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,545
Go on. Shoot me.

597
00:59:54,289 --> 00:59:55,779
Shoot me, killer.

598
00:59:59,061 --> 01:00:02,030
I ought to stomp your ass,
pointing this thing at me.

599
01:00:05,134 --> 01:00:06,624
Damn it, Laz.

600
01:00:06,735 --> 01:00:09,226
I know we ain't blood,
but we was raised like brothers,

601
01:00:09,338 --> 01:00:11,898
since the very first day
we was slapped on the ass.

602
01:00:12,007 --> 01:00:14,134
Now you gonna go point a gun at me?

603
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:23,450
If you were in some kind of trouble,
then we gonna figure something out.

604
01:00:23,552 --> 01:00:25,042
You and me.

605
01:00:29,057 --> 01:00:31,525
Here. Go on, wipe your face off.

606
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,868
This got something to do with Rose?

607
01:00:43,238 --> 01:00:44,500
Then what?

608
01:00:55,417 --> 01:00:57,112
I didn't wanna do it.

609
01:01:06,395 --> 01:01:08,659
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

610
01:01:08,764 --> 01:01:09,992
Man in your line of work

611
01:01:10,098 --> 01:01:12,794
ought to not use the Lord's name in vain
like you just did.

612
01:01:12,901 --> 01:01:14,869
A half-naked white woman
chained up in your house!

613
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:18,997
Now look here, I found that girl beat on
and left for dead out on the road!

614
01:01:19,107 --> 01:01:20,574
I just brung her home!

615
01:01:20,676 --> 01:01:22,371
Laz, I know that girl!

616
01:01:22,477 --> 01:01:26,436
She had a whole mess of crabs
and STDs! What you thinking?

617
01:01:26,548 --> 01:01:30,177
I swear on my mamma's grave, R. <i>L.,</i>
I ain't touched that girl.

618
01:01:30,285 --> 01:01:31,877
My wick dry on this.

619
01:01:38,527 --> 01:01:41,496
You say she was beat on.
You call the Sheriff on this?

620
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:45,363
R. <i>L.,</i> now put yourself in my place.

621
01:01:45,467 --> 01:01:48,027
You out here by yourself with,
as you say,

622
01:01:48,136 --> 01:01:51,333
a half-naked white woman
who love to fuck.

623
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,341
Now, I done been toe to toe
with the law in this town a heap of times

624
01:01:54,443 --> 01:01:56,434
just for being black and nearby.

625
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:01,781
- What's that chain around her waist for?
- Go on in there and ask her.

626
01:02:02,618 --> 01:02:06,213
Now this girl been rut on
and beat on all her days.

627
01:02:06,321 --> 01:02:09,552
She need to talk to somebody
with some sense and some reasoning.

628
01:02:09,658 --> 01:02:10,852
That's you.

629
01:02:11,827 --> 01:02:13,988
Just go in there and talk to her.

630
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:17,158
Please.

631
01:02:22,938 --> 01:02:24,963
And I'm fixing steaks for supper.

632
01:02:26,208 --> 01:02:27,937
I expect you to stay.

633
01:02:28,043 --> 01:02:32,002
You expect me to sit down and eat with
that woman chained up the way she is?

634
01:02:32,114 --> 01:02:34,708
R. <i>L.,</i> you watch yourself in there.

635
01:02:35,417 --> 01:02:38,045
That gal be on your dick
like stank on shit.

636
01:02:45,794 --> 01:02:46,988
Lincoln.

637
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:49,790
Come here, boy. Come on.

638
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:54,268
- I ain't hurt you none, did I?
- No, sir.

639
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:56,467
Look here.

640
01:02:57,372 --> 01:03:01,468
What happened up yonder at the house,
that wasn't your fault.

641
01:03:01,576 --> 01:03:03,976
Ain't a young man alive
could've kept his pants on

642
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:06,479
with that girl in heat like she is.

643
01:03:06,581 --> 01:03:08,310
Why she got a chain on her?

644
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:11,978
Well, now, that's between me and her,
that's private.

645
01:03:13,655 --> 01:03:14,679
So,

646
01:03:16,692 --> 01:03:19,252
- that your first time?
- Yes, sir.

647
01:03:20,095 --> 01:03:23,087
Shit! I remember my first time

648
01:03:23,198 --> 01:03:26,099
was out behind my uncle's barn
with my second cousin.

649
01:03:27,669 --> 01:03:31,799
Man, that girl must've weighed two tons
if she weighed a pound.

650
01:03:31,907 --> 01:03:34,432
Could've done a lot better for myself.

651
01:03:34,543 --> 01:03:37,137
Hell, look like you sure enough did.

652
01:03:40,048 --> 01:03:42,380
- You want a cigarette?
- No, sir.

653
01:03:42,884 --> 01:03:45,079
That's usually what you do
when you get through, you know.

654
01:03:45,187 --> 01:03:47,451
You either smoke
or leave them smoking.

655
01:03:53,061 --> 01:03:55,791
- You a preacher?
- That's right.

656
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,294
Can I ask you a question?

657
01:04:02,037 --> 01:04:05,234
You know how people are always
saying, you gotta get right with Jesus

658
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,171
if you want not to go to hell, you know.

659
01:04:07,309 --> 01:04:11,336
Gotta say you're sorry
and Jesus will let you into heaven.

660
01:04:12,681 --> 01:04:14,740
You can put it that way.

661
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:16,943
That's so fucking stupid.

662
01:04:17,052 --> 01:04:20,044
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I don't mean to curse. I just...

663
01:04:20,155 --> 01:04:23,147
No, no, no. What's on your mind?
What's on your mind?

664
01:04:25,093 --> 01:04:28,062
You can't go around hurting people
and then just

665
01:04:28,163 --> 01:04:30,825
say you're sorry
and it all gets washed away.

666
01:04:32,134 --> 01:04:34,398
Why would heaven
want people like that?

667
01:04:40,909 --> 01:04:42,433
I'm gonna tell you something,

668
01:04:42,544 --> 01:04:45,604
and it's just gonna be
between you and me.

669
01:04:45,714 --> 01:04:48,945
I think folks
carry on about heaven too much.

670
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:53,010
Like it's some kind of
all-you-can-eat buffet up in the clouds,

671
01:04:53,121 --> 01:04:55,248
and folks just do as they're told

672
01:04:55,357 --> 01:04:58,451
so they can eat what they want
behind some pearly gates.

673
01:05:05,333 --> 01:05:07,301
There's sin in my heart.

674
01:05:09,137 --> 01:05:11,298
There's evil in the world.

675
01:05:11,406 --> 01:05:15,308
But when I got no one, I talk to God.

676
01:05:17,212 --> 01:05:19,271
I ask for strength.

677
01:05:19,381 --> 01:05:21,315
I ask for forgiveness.

678
01:05:21,416 --> 01:05:24,783
Not peace at the end of my days
when I got no more life to live

679
01:05:24,886 --> 01:05:27,354
or no more good to do, but today.

680
01:05:28,757 --> 01:05:30,088
Right now.

681
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:36,825
What's your heaven?

682
01:05:42,637 --> 01:05:43,797
Ronnie.

683
01:06:16,938 --> 01:06:18,428
Holy shit.

684
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:28,449
Hey, Jim, let's get Ronnie set up here.

685
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,487
Thank you.

686
01:06:34,756 --> 01:06:36,018
Hey, Herman.

687
01:06:36,658 --> 01:06:39,718
Hey, Ronnie.
They buy you that Big Chicken Dinner?

688
01:06:42,497 --> 01:06:43,725
The what?

689
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:46,760
They got different names
for things in the Corps

690
01:06:46,868 --> 01:06:48,733
when they trying to get rid of you.

691
01:06:48,837 --> 01:06:50,600
I don't know what it's like in the Guard,

692
01:06:50,705 --> 01:06:55,506
but there's a thing called the
Bad Conduct Discharge, a BCD.

693
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:58,545
It's not the same as the brig,
but it'll sure fuck you up for life

694
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:01,445
if you ever wanna work
for the government.

695
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:03,643
How do you get one of them deals?

696
01:07:03,752 --> 01:07:06,021
Well, blowing boys in the head...

697
01:07:06,054 --> 01:07:06,248
Well, blowing boys in the head...

698
01:07:06,354 --> 01:07:07,946
Whoa, whoa, whoa, son!

699
01:07:08,056 --> 01:07:10,115
I ain't saying shit about you.
I'm just talking.

700
01:07:10,225 --> 01:07:12,750
You don't know what you're
talking about, so shut the fuck up!

701
01:07:12,861 --> 01:07:14,761
All right, man. All right! It's all right!

702
01:07:14,863 --> 01:07:18,060
Hey, Herman. Come on, man.
He just got back. Shit.

703
01:07:18,166 --> 01:07:20,600
To get back
he had to have gone somewhere.

704
01:07:20,702 --> 01:07:22,397
- Fuck you!
- All right, man.

705
01:07:24,439 --> 01:07:27,033
- Come on, sit down.
- God damn it.

706
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:40,047
So what happened?

707
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:46,592
They been keeping a folder on me
'cause of my stomach.

708
01:07:47,495 --> 01:07:50,760
Like how I used to get before games
back in school.

709
01:07:53,134 --> 01:07:54,601
I can't shoot.

710
01:07:55,537 --> 01:07:57,732
I mean, target practice, I'm a pro.

711
01:07:57,839 --> 01:08:00,307
I can tag
right between the numbers, but...

712
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:07,909
Something happens
when I get around loud noises.

713
01:08:08,817 --> 01:08:12,685
I get shaky and start to lose my breath.

714
01:08:15,156 --> 01:08:17,056
They called it anxiety.

715
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:19,250
Severe anxiety.

716
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:24,289
Anyway, they sent me home.

717
01:08:28,837 --> 01:08:32,238
I guess it could be worse.
Could be coming back in a body bag.

718
01:08:33,041 --> 01:08:35,271
Hey, I can't get Rae on the phone.

719
01:08:36,678 --> 01:08:38,873
I mean, I called, she's not at home.

720
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:40,709
None of her friends
seem to know where she is.

721
01:08:40,815 --> 01:08:41,873
She's around.

722
01:08:41,983 --> 01:08:43,041
Always is.

723
01:08:43,151 --> 01:08:45,244
I don't know. I just feel like
something bad's happened.

724
01:08:45,353 --> 01:08:48,151
You'd tell me
if you knew something, right?

725
01:08:55,463 --> 01:08:58,990
Now that's sharp. That is sharp.

726
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:01,159
You ain't had no trouble with that chain,
did you?

727
01:09:01,269 --> 01:09:02,293
No.

728
01:09:06,007 --> 01:09:08,942
Well, steaks is on.

729
01:09:09,844 --> 01:09:11,835
Potatoes is boiling.

730
01:09:11,946 --> 01:09:14,676
R.L. And Lincoln are out there
grilling the corn.

731
01:09:14,783 --> 01:09:17,445
I'm about to throw these biscuits
in the oven.

732
01:09:17,552 --> 01:09:20,715
- What you know how to fix?
- I don't fucking cook.

733
01:09:20,822 --> 01:09:24,952
You know, Rae, I known a whole bunch
of hard-cussing people in my day...

734
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:28,655
All right, all right. Now, look.
I put the goddamn dress on, okay?

735
01:09:28,763 --> 01:09:31,231
I think I'm handling myself
with a little bit of fucking restraint,

736
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:33,824
how you got me chained up here
like I'm some kind of dog!

737
01:09:33,935 --> 01:09:35,163
Rae. Rae!

738
01:09:36,237 --> 01:09:38,137
I ain't arguing with you.

739
01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:42,175
All I'm saying is
I know you got more in you than filth.

740
01:09:45,013 --> 01:09:47,846
- You saying you can't cook nothing?
- No.

741
01:09:50,085 --> 01:09:54,044
- Can you boil water?
- I think I can handle that.

742
01:09:54,189 --> 01:09:56,953
All right. Get to handling it.

743
01:10:03,865 --> 01:10:07,232
- We gonna eat with her?
- That's what I'm told.

744
01:10:10,672 --> 01:10:14,301
- She still gonna have that chain on?
- Well, I'm working on that.

745
01:10:15,977 --> 01:10:18,673
We ask you to bless this meal
put before us.

746
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:20,611
May this food nourish our bodies

747
01:10:20,715 --> 01:10:22,808
and may the fellowship
nourish our spirit.

748
01:10:22,917 --> 01:10:25,283
In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

749
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:26,615
Amen.

750
01:10:27,522 --> 01:10:30,320
Y'all let me know
if these steaks is too dry, all right?

751
01:10:30,425 --> 01:10:33,519
And don't be shy now.
Got plenty over here.

752
01:10:33,628 --> 01:10:36,825
- This all looks wonderful.
- I skipped lunch today.

753
01:10:40,502 --> 01:10:43,938
These eggs got a little kick to them.
What you put in this?

754
01:10:44,038 --> 01:10:47,064
I expect you need to ask the chef here.

755
01:10:47,175 --> 01:10:48,665
Cayenne pepper.

756
01:11:04,559 --> 01:11:05,617
Rae?

757
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:08,956
Rae?

758
01:11:22,277 --> 01:11:23,972
Kitchen looks just like I left it.

759
01:11:24,078 --> 01:11:26,410
She ever tell you
she was thinking of taking off?

760
01:11:26,514 --> 01:11:29,312
You know how she gets!
With her history...

761
01:11:30,518 --> 01:11:31,746
God damn!

762
01:11:35,857 --> 01:11:38,758
I guess I could see
how she could get scared.

763
01:11:44,799 --> 01:11:46,562
All right. All right, man.

764
01:11:47,335 --> 01:11:48,632
Sit down.

765
01:11:59,614 --> 01:12:02,583
Her mamma works down
at the grocery down on the square.

766
01:12:02,684 --> 01:12:04,914
- Hell, maybe she's seen her.
- Ronnie.

767
01:12:05,019 --> 01:12:07,681
You can't see it
'cause you're too close to it.

768
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:12,182
Anxiety spells you get,
you never had that shit back in school.

769
01:12:12,293 --> 01:12:14,420
- That's not true...
- You joined up in that monkey troop

770
01:12:14,529 --> 01:12:16,520
'cause you had a plan for yourself!

771
01:12:16,631 --> 01:12:19,395
Army's gonna pay for school.
Gonna get yourself a degree.

772
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:21,332
Maybe something in business
or agriculture.

773
01:12:21,436 --> 01:12:22,994
You were gonna
make something of yourself.

774
01:12:23,104 --> 01:12:26,540
Then you had to go and fall in love
with the school slut.

775
01:12:26,641 --> 01:12:29,235
Hey, I know about how she was like.

776
01:12:29,944 --> 01:12:32,640
Hey, I was the only one
she talked to about it.

777
01:12:32,747 --> 01:12:34,442
How she was abused.

778
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:38,145
- Terrible things, Gill.
- Bullshit.

779
01:12:38,253 --> 01:12:40,187
Terrible things. Things you
don't even wanna know about.

780
01:12:40,288 --> 01:12:41,755
You had a plan!

781
01:12:42,290 --> 01:12:45,123
You had a goddamn life
and she just fucked the guts out of you!

782
01:12:45,226 --> 01:12:47,660
She had to take care of me
the whole time!

783
01:12:49,330 --> 01:12:52,424
Shit, I'd start throwing up, choking!

784
01:12:55,169 --> 01:12:58,195
And I got better. You know?

785
01:12:59,841 --> 01:13:03,572
And since we been together
she put all that junk behind her.

786
01:13:04,812 --> 01:13:06,473
She been faithful.

787
01:13:19,494 --> 01:13:21,189
First weekend away,

788
01:13:22,263 --> 01:13:25,164
when you was off playing soldier
on Saturdays,

789
01:13:25,266 --> 01:13:28,702
I come over, drop off spare keys
like you want me to.

790
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:32,165
You weren't gone two hours

791
01:13:34,275 --> 01:13:37,108
and she was aching
to get me inside of her.

792
01:13:37,979 --> 01:13:41,642
I mean, every time you leave town,
that pussy's up for grabs.

793
01:13:41,749 --> 01:13:43,216
You're a liar.

794
01:13:45,386 --> 01:13:46,853
Is that right?

795
01:13:47,989 --> 01:13:51,891
Don't you think it's funny how I know
where everything in your house is?

796
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:58,424
I don't care if that hurts you or not.
I really don't.

797
01:14:02,203 --> 01:14:03,397
Truth is

798
01:14:05,373 --> 01:14:07,642
I don't even know who you are anymore.

799
01:14:07,675 --> 01:14:08,006
I don't even know who you are anymore.

800
01:14:09,744 --> 01:14:12,577
So fuck it.

801
01:14:54,522 --> 01:14:57,548
- You gonna steal my truck now?
- Make yourself at home.

802
01:14:58,393 --> 01:15:00,190
You've done it already.

803
01:15:16,077 --> 01:15:18,637
- You take it straight?
- Sure.

804
01:15:30,224 --> 01:15:31,350
Jesus!

805
01:15:34,262 --> 01:15:36,389
- You want another one?
- Sure.

806
01:15:37,598 --> 01:15:39,566
We drinking buddies now?

807
01:15:43,237 --> 01:15:44,761
To

808
01:15:50,445 --> 01:15:51,639
freedom.

809
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,575
Still making jokes.

810
01:15:58,453 --> 01:16:00,182
This ain't no joke.

811
01:16:01,889 --> 01:16:03,220
Come here.

812
01:16:09,597 --> 01:16:12,998
It ain't on me to change your life
or nobody else's.

813
01:16:15,136 --> 01:16:19,129
Shit. People gonna do
what the hell they wanna do anyway.

814
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:27,639
You ain't got but one life.

815
01:16:28,783 --> 01:16:31,377
You ought to live it the way you want.

816
01:16:42,563 --> 01:16:45,430
I can take you back to town now
if you want.

817
01:16:49,537 --> 01:16:50,561
Laz,

818
01:16:52,373 --> 01:16:54,534
will you do something for me?

819
01:16:58,312 --> 01:16:59,939
Whatever you want.

820
01:17:33,147 --> 01:17:35,615
I ain't played for nobody in years.

821
01:17:43,925 --> 01:17:47,292
I wanted me some kids,
a whole mess of them.

822
01:17:48,362 --> 01:17:52,731
But for Rose, my wife,
kids is for another time.

823
01:17:58,039 --> 01:17:59,597
Then one spring,

824
01:18:02,410 --> 01:18:04,435
I seened a change in her.

825
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,807
Her breasts started swelling up.

826
01:18:08,749 --> 01:18:12,549
Couple of mornings,
I hear her in the bathroom throwing up.

827
01:18:12,653 --> 01:18:17,488
I done seen it in other women before,
so I knew.

828
01:18:21,729 --> 01:18:23,026
Then one day,

829
01:18:24,065 --> 01:18:27,501
Rose said she had to go to Jackson,
visit her folks,

830
01:18:27,602 --> 01:18:31,299
and she ain't wanted me to go,
so I stayed here.

831
01:18:34,742 --> 01:18:38,542
You know how they talk about a woman
having that glow?

832
01:18:41,382 --> 01:18:43,475
She didn't have it no more.

833
01:18:45,953 --> 01:18:47,682
She done cut it out.

834
01:18:48,923 --> 01:18:50,413
Got rid of it.

835
01:18:56,430 --> 01:18:58,330
That voice in my head,

836
01:18:59,734 --> 01:19:03,500
every time I think it's gone,
it comes howling back.

837
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:08,271
Calls me when I'm ailing,

838
01:19:09,043 --> 01:19:11,773
when I can't find my way home.

839
01:19:12,246 --> 01:19:14,111
Lost in the pines.

840
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:18,478
I calls it the <i>Black Snake Moan.</i>

841
01:19:25,059 --> 01:19:29,052
<i>Black snake all in my room</i>

842
01:19:41,175 --> 01:19:44,804
<i>Black snake all in my room</i>

843
01:19:53,154 --> 01:19:56,021
<i>Some pretty mamma</i>

844
01:19:56,390 --> 01:20:00,554
<i>Better get this black snake soon</i>

845
01:20:08,869 --> 01:20:11,633
Sing, Laz. Please keep singing.

846
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:22,048
<i>Black snake is evil</i>

847
01:20:23,384 --> 01:20:27,115
<i>Black snake is all I see</i>

848
01:20:34,795 --> 01:20:37,059
<i>Black snake is evil</i>

849
01:20:38,599 --> 01:20:42,091
<i>Black snake is all I see</i>

850
01:20:49,877 --> 01:20:51,868
<i>Woke up this morning</i>

851
01:20:54,215 --> 01:20:57,776
<i>Black snake moved in on me</i>

852
01:21:42,296 --> 01:21:45,129
- Where you gonna be?
- I'm gonna be right here.

853
01:21:45,232 --> 01:21:47,029
- Be here all afternoon.
- Okay.

854
01:21:51,772 --> 01:21:52,830
Hey.

855
01:21:54,408 --> 01:21:56,535
You sure you ready for this?

856
01:21:58,379 --> 01:22:01,610
Yeah. Yeah, no big deal.
I'm just gonna get some girlie stuff.

857
01:22:01,715 --> 01:22:03,979
You know, like some makeup and stuff.

858
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:06,850
All right.

859
01:22:21,001 --> 01:22:22,059
Hey.

860
01:22:22,803 --> 01:22:25,271
You know,
this town ain't going nowhere.

861
01:22:25,372 --> 01:22:27,465
Take all the time you need.

862
01:22:28,008 --> 01:22:29,339
All right.

863
01:22:50,965 --> 01:22:52,728
She a friend of mine.

864
01:23:10,684 --> 01:23:13,710
I bet you got a lot of loyal customers.

865
01:23:13,821 --> 01:23:15,755
- Hey, Miss Angie.
- Hey.

866
01:23:16,790 --> 01:23:18,451
Like what I brung you, huh?

867
01:23:18,559 --> 01:23:21,392
I've been eating like a princess all week.

868
01:23:22,329 --> 01:23:24,797
I even got enough for us to take lunch.

869
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:26,230
That'd be nice.

870
01:23:26,333 --> 01:23:29,325
And I got that lotion on you gave me.

871
01:23:31,071 --> 01:23:32,732
Can you smell it?

872
01:23:36,911 --> 01:23:38,572
Now that's nice, too.

873
01:23:58,732 --> 01:23:59,790
Hey.

874
01:24:01,769 --> 01:24:03,703
What happened to your face?

875
01:24:04,405 --> 01:24:06,464
I got in a little accident.

876
01:24:09,543 --> 01:24:12,171
I was thinking,
since you're working on the square now,

877
01:24:12,279 --> 01:24:16,238
if you wanted to, we could get coffee
or something some morning.

878
01:24:16,350 --> 01:24:19,148
- You need money again?
- No.

879
01:24:19,253 --> 01:24:20,481
No, I...

880
01:24:21,922 --> 01:24:23,719
Why we always gotta do this?

881
01:24:23,824 --> 01:24:26,588
You and me been at each other
as far back as I can remember.

882
01:24:26,694 --> 01:24:28,127
I'm your daughter.

883
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:33,360
- I'm the only family you got.
- You never needed nobody, Rae.

884
01:24:33,467 --> 01:24:35,526
You always made that
perfectly clear to me.

885
01:24:35,636 --> 01:24:37,069
I know I did.

886
01:24:38,505 --> 01:24:42,635
But I'm trying to be different, you know.
I'm trying to get some peace.

887
01:24:44,178 --> 01:24:47,511
Yeah, well, I'm working here now.
Can't you see that?

888
01:24:51,485 --> 01:24:53,510
I just wanted some makeup.

889
01:24:53,621 --> 01:24:55,612
All that shit's on aisle five.

890
01:25:03,597 --> 01:25:06,623
I just think you should've
kept him off me, that's all.

891
01:25:13,841 --> 01:25:17,538
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Now don't do that, Mamma.

892
01:25:17,645 --> 01:25:20,239
I will go along
with all the crap you talk about me,

893
01:25:20,347 --> 01:25:22,542
but you can't pretend no more on that.

894
01:25:22,650 --> 01:25:24,140
'Cause I was just a kid.

895
01:25:24,251 --> 01:25:26,617
I didn't know
about all that shit he was doing to me.

896
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:28,654
And you let him do it.

897
01:25:28,756 --> 01:25:31,987
Some big nobody in your life and you
let him do whatever the fuck he wanted!

898
01:25:32,092 --> 01:25:35,323
No. Okay. All right. I'm sorry, Mamma.
I didn't mean to shout.

899
01:25:35,429 --> 01:25:36,919
Sorry, I didn't mean to get upset.
I just...

900
01:25:37,031 --> 01:25:38,828
All my life I've been
putting out your fires

901
01:25:38,932 --> 01:25:41,765
while you been giving out your snatch
to every wagging dick in this town!

902
01:25:41,869 --> 01:25:43,029
And now you're gonna
put the blame at my feet?

903
01:25:43,137 --> 01:25:44,263
Mamma, if we can just talk about it.

904
01:25:44,371 --> 01:25:45,998
If you could just tell me,
we could be eye to eye on this.

905
01:25:46,106 --> 01:25:47,266
I'm just not gonna take your shit.
No, I'm not.

906
01:25:47,374 --> 01:25:50,571
You don't have to say you're sorry!
Just tell me how you knew!

907
01:25:50,678 --> 01:25:52,771
The only thing I'm sorry for

908
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:55,280
is for ever listening to my parents
and having you

909
01:25:55,382 --> 01:25:57,509
and not doing what I should've done.

910
01:26:07,928 --> 01:26:11,728
Tell me you didn't know,
you goddamn liar! Tell me!

911
01:26:12,499 --> 01:26:15,161
You fucking liar!

912
01:26:15,269 --> 01:26:16,759
Fuck you!

913
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:20,499
You were in the next goddamn room,
you bitch!

914
01:26:22,242 --> 01:26:25,268
What you be doing with yourself
when you ain't working?

915
01:26:26,380 --> 01:26:29,281
I was thinking about singing in the choir.

916
01:26:29,383 --> 01:26:30,816
Up at the church?

917
01:26:30,918 --> 01:26:34,012
- Why don't you sing me something?
- When? Now?

918
01:26:34,121 --> 01:26:35,247
- Yeah.
- Oh, no.

919
01:26:35,356 --> 01:26:39,520
Come on now, don't be shy.
Just go ahead and let it out.

920
01:26:43,063 --> 01:26:44,724
All right. Let's see.

921
01:26:47,201 --> 01:26:53,436
<i>There is a balm in Gilead</i>

922
01:26:55,109 --> 01:27:00,376
<i>To make the wounded whole</i>

923
01:27:01,582 --> 01:27:08,044
<i>There is a balm in Gilead</i>

924
01:27:09,022 --> 01:27:14,153
<i>To heal the sin sick soul</i>

925
01:27:15,095 --> 01:27:17,325
What? What is it?

926
01:27:19,366 --> 01:27:20,697
Get off!

927
01:27:22,169 --> 01:27:23,568
My God!

928
01:27:25,839 --> 01:27:28,637
Turn her loose!
Turn her loose, God damn it!

929
01:27:34,348 --> 01:27:36,441
Do you hear the sound of my voice?

930
01:27:41,321 --> 01:27:43,789
Y'all get on out the way now.
Move, man!

931
01:27:48,595 --> 01:27:49,960
This your niece?

932
01:28:21,728 --> 01:28:24,526
You took care of your wife
like you do me?

933
01:28:27,201 --> 01:28:28,395
I tried.

934
01:29:25,459 --> 01:29:27,825
Ain't no use in us fighting this shit.

935
01:29:27,928 --> 01:29:30,123
You and me, we night owls.

936
01:29:31,265 --> 01:29:32,527
Get dressed.

937
01:29:49,983 --> 01:29:52,645
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

938
01:30:00,561 --> 01:30:02,688
All right, see if you can find yourself
a seat over there

939
01:30:02,796 --> 01:30:04,764
in the corner on that bench.

940
01:30:04,865 --> 01:30:07,333
Go on.
Ain't nobody gonna fuck with you.

941
01:30:08,235 --> 01:30:09,634
Who the hell's all this?

942
01:30:09,736 --> 01:30:13,001
What? I called Bojo, like you said.
Called the fellas in the band.

943
01:30:13,106 --> 01:30:14,767
Where the fuck
all these people come from?

944
01:30:14,875 --> 01:30:16,570
I been drinking
in this shithole all my life,

945
01:30:16,677 --> 01:30:18,736
I ain't never seen
this many people in here at once.

946
01:30:18,845 --> 01:30:20,710
Shithole? Kiss my ass, Laz.

947
01:30:20,814 --> 01:30:22,213
Back at you, motherfucker.

948
01:30:22,316 --> 01:30:25,581
I bet both of y'all called all these people,
didn't you?

949
01:30:25,686 --> 01:30:29,087
That's right, preacher, get me drunk
so I don't stick my foot up your ass.

950
01:30:29,189 --> 01:30:31,123
I just know how you get.

951
01:30:31,224 --> 01:30:34,318
Good to know
you still got some butterflies in your gut.

952
01:30:35,462 --> 01:30:37,259
All right, here we go.

953
01:30:38,131 --> 01:30:39,496
Hey, y'all.

954
01:30:40,334 --> 01:30:41,392
All right.

955
01:30:49,977 --> 01:30:53,469
Ced. Ken. Thank y'all for coming.

956
01:30:55,215 --> 01:30:57,740
All y'all, hush up. Shut up.

957
01:30:58,952 --> 01:31:02,149
All right now.
Y'all ready for some shit?

958
01:31:03,423 --> 01:31:05,448
Is you ready for some shit?

959
01:31:07,427 --> 01:31:08,792
<i>Alice Mae.</i>

960
01:31:18,305 --> 01:31:21,138
<i>If you see my baby</i>

961
01:31:21,241 --> 01:31:24,438
<i>They call her Alice Mae</i>

962
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:26,671
Yeah! You home now, old man!

963
01:31:26,780 --> 01:31:29,078
You just walked through the door!
Yeah!

964
01:31:29,182 --> 01:31:31,742
<i>If you see my baby</i>

965
01:31:31,852 --> 01:31:35,413
<i>They call her Alice Mae</i>

966
01:31:35,522 --> 01:31:37,387
You wanna cut it up, baby?

967
01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:42,888
<i>Tell all them fellas</i>

968
01:31:42,996 --> 01:31:45,931
<i>They'd better stay away</i>

969
01:31:50,337 --> 01:31:52,965
<i>Tell all them fellas</i>

970
01:31:53,073 --> 01:31:56,236
<i>In this here neighborhood</i>

971
01:32:00,914 --> 01:32:03,405
<i>Tell all them fellas</i>

972
01:32:03,517 --> 01:32:06,748
<i>In this here neighborhood</i>

973
01:32:11,958 --> 01:32:14,051
<i>This here's my woman</i>

974
01:32:14,161 --> 01:32:19,292
<i>That chacha will do you no good</i>

975
01:32:28,241 --> 01:32:30,607
Whoa! Yeah!

976
01:32:42,823 --> 01:32:46,486
<i>This here a song from back in the day</i>

977
01:32:46,593 --> 01:32:49,562
<i>Nineteen hundred and sixty-two</i>

978
01:32:51,231 --> 01:32:54,723
<i>My woman put my black ass</i>
<i>out in the cold</i>

979
01:32:54,835 --> 01:32:56,860
<i>I said, "Baby, why you leaving?"</i>

980
01:32:56,970 --> 01:32:59,302
<i>She said, "Our love done gone cold"</i>

981
01:32:59,406 --> 01:33:03,570
<i>Well, I waded through water</i>
<i>and I waded through mud</i>

982
01:33:03,677 --> 01:33:08,080
<i>Till I come to this place</i>
<i>they call the Bucket of Blood</i>

983
01:33:17,858 --> 01:33:20,986
<i>You know, that bartender</i>
<i>give me a dirty look and a dirty glass</i>

984
01:33:21,094 --> 01:33:25,360
<i>I said, "Say, motherfucker!</i>
<i>Do you know who I am?"</i>

985
01:33:25,465 --> 01:33:29,834
<i>He said, "Hell no, nigger!</i>
<i>I don't give a goddamn!"</i>

986
01:33:39,579 --> 01:33:43,379
<i>I reached down in my pocket</i>
<i>and pulled out my shiny.44</i>

987
01:33:43,483 --> 01:33:45,542
<i>Shot that motherfucker twice!</i>

988
01:33:45,652 --> 01:33:47,279
<i>He hit the goddamn floor</i>

989
01:33:52,392 --> 01:33:56,055
<i>'Bout that time</i>
<i>you could've heard the drop of a pin</i>

990
01:33:56,163 --> 01:34:00,532
<i>That's when that bad motherfucker</i>
<i>Billy Lyons walked in</i>

991
01:34:09,709 --> 01:34:13,907
<i>'Bout that time a pimp eased up</i>
<i>and turned out the lights</i>

992
01:34:14,014 --> 01:34:17,745
<i>That's when I had old Billy Lyons</i>
<i>dead in my sights</i>

993
01:34:17,851 --> 01:34:21,480
<i>When the lights come back on</i>
<i>old Billy gone to rest</i>

994
01:34:21,588 --> 01:34:25,820
<i>I pumped nine of my bullets</i>
<i>in his motherfucking chest!</i>

995
01:35:04,464 --> 01:35:07,126
<i>Sometime, that kind of blues</i>

996
01:35:07,868 --> 01:35:11,702
<i>will make you even kill one another</i>

997
01:35:11,805 --> 01:35:15,332
<i>or do anything that kind of low.</i>

998
01:35:16,009 --> 01:35:19,240
<i>It goes here, on this side.</i>

999
01:35:20,881 --> 01:35:22,644
<i>That's where the blues started.</i>

1000
01:35:22,749 --> 01:35:25,013
<i>It ain't on this side. It's over here.</i>

1001
01:35:30,290 --> 01:35:32,952
<i>This little light of mine</i>

1002
01:35:33,059 --> 01:35:36,324
<i>I'm gonna let it shine</i>

1003
01:35:36,429 --> 01:35:39,330
<i>This little light of mine</i>

1004
01:35:42,235 --> 01:35:44,726
<i>This little light of mine</i>

1005
01:35:48,675 --> 01:35:51,735
<i>This little light of mine</i>

1006
01:35:51,845 --> 01:35:54,871
<i>I'm gonna let it shine</i>

1007
01:35:54,981 --> 01:35:57,347
<i>This little light of...</i>

1008
01:35:58,618 --> 01:36:00,085
<i>This little light of mine</i>

1009
01:36:00,186 --> 01:36:02,245
Look like somebody know a song.

1010
01:36:03,790 --> 01:36:07,282
No. I got the words in my head
but, you know...

1011
01:36:07,394 --> 01:36:10,263
I don't know where I learned it.
But I can't play.

1012
01:36:11,298 --> 01:36:12,856
How you feeling?

1013
01:36:14,367 --> 01:36:17,302
You know how you feel
when you come out of a bad hangover?

1014
01:36:17,404 --> 01:36:20,134
You know, like you could
open your eyes a little more?

1015
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:22,367
Yeah. Yeah, I'm there.

1016
01:36:23,576 --> 01:36:26,875
I got up real early this morning.
You know, the sun was shining.

1017
01:36:26,980 --> 01:36:29,778
And I thought
maybe I'd see if I could play this, but...

1018
01:36:29,883 --> 01:36:31,851
- You can.
- No, I can't.

1019
01:36:31,952 --> 01:36:34,420
Yeah, you can.
Right here. Right here, see?

1020
01:36:37,057 --> 01:36:40,356
- I tell you what. You sing.
- All right.

1021
01:36:40,460 --> 01:36:43,327
- I'll see if I can pick it out for you.
- Okay.

1022
01:36:45,365 --> 01:36:46,832
All right, now.

1023
01:36:47,467 --> 01:36:52,928
Just close your eyes
and think on what you love.

1024
01:36:54,741 --> 01:36:57,539
- Get a real good picture of it.
- What I love.

1025
01:37:02,148 --> 01:37:05,345
<i>This little light of mine</i>

1026
01:37:05,452 --> 01:37:08,615

1027
01:37:08,722 --> 01:37:11,714
<i>This little light of mine</i>

1028
01:37:11,825 --> 01:37:14,919

01:37:18,131 --> 01:37:20,326
<i>I'm gonna let it shine</i>

1031
01:37:20,433 --> 01:37:26,133
<i>Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine</i>

1032
01:37:27,407 --> 01:37:29,534
<i>Hide it under a bushel</i>

1033
01:37:29,642 --> 01:37:33,373
<i>No, I'm gonna let it shine</i>

1034
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:35,573
<i>Hide it under a bushel</i>

1035
01:37:35,682 --> 01:37:39,675
<i>No, I'm gonna let it shine</i>

1036
01:37:39,786 --> 01:37:41,879
<i>Hide it under a bushel</i>

1037
01:37:41,988 --> 01:37:44,786
<i>No, I'm gonna let it shine</i>

1038
01:37:44,891 --> 01:37:50,761
<i>Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine</i>

1039
01:37:52,098 --> 01:37:54,692

<i>I'm gonna let it shine</i>

1045
01:38:09,682 --> 01:38:14,642
<i>Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine</i>

1046
01:38:16,423 --> 01:38:17,617
Ronnie!

1047
01:38:18,258 --> 01:38:19,316
No!

1048
01:38:21,828 --> 01:38:25,764
It ain't been but a week
and you already some nigger's whore.

1049
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:29,834
Oh, did you think I wouldn't find out?

1050
01:38:31,171 --> 01:38:33,503
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

1051
01:38:33,606 --> 01:38:38,043
Gill told me how you and him...
How you and everybody...

1052
01:38:38,144 --> 01:38:40,271
Did you have fun with her, huh?

1053
01:38:41,047 --> 01:38:43,777
Sweet as a peach, I bet! Huh?

1054
01:38:43,883 --> 01:38:46,147
- No!
- Shut up, bitch! Shut the fuck up!

1055
01:38:46,252 --> 01:38:48,914
Be careful where you aim that gun, boy.

1056
01:38:50,290 --> 01:38:52,724
Or what? Huh?

1057
01:38:53,593 --> 01:38:54,992
Or what?

1058
01:38:55,095 --> 01:38:57,359
You come to talk, boy,
or you come to kill somebody?

1059
01:38:57,464 --> 01:39:00,228
You ain't gonna be calling me boy
when I blow your fucking face off!

1060
01:39:00,333 --> 01:39:04,736
Boy, you so green
you couldn't stomp a baby duck.

1061
01:39:05,605 --> 01:39:07,664
Are you testing me? Huh?

1062
01:39:07,774 --> 01:39:10,208
Just what kind of test
would that be, huh?

1063
01:39:11,211 --> 01:39:12,838
Test if you're a man?

1064
01:39:13,746 --> 01:39:15,441
If you're a killer?

1065
01:39:16,316 --> 01:39:18,807
Hell, that ain't hard to find out, is it?

1066
01:39:18,918 --> 01:39:21,648
All you gotta do is pull that trigger back.

1067
01:39:22,288 --> 01:39:23,414
Go on.

1068
01:39:24,190 --> 01:39:25,452
Go ahead.

1069
01:39:28,761 --> 01:39:30,854
- Okay, Ronnie...
- God damn it, Rae!

1070
01:39:30,964 --> 01:39:33,364
Keep that gun trained on me, boy.

1071
01:39:33,466 --> 01:39:36,799
Now, you wanna kill a man,
and all you need's a reason, right?

1072
01:39:36,903 --> 01:39:39,303
Well, you know
she been out here with me.

1073
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:44,733
Been all over town giving up that switch
you thought was yours.

1074
01:39:44,844 --> 01:39:48,041
- Shut up!
- Give all your love to one woman

1075
01:39:48,148 --> 01:39:50,514
and she give it to another man.

1076
01:39:50,617 --> 01:39:53,245
Now that's a reason to kill a man there.

1077
01:39:53,353 --> 01:39:57,084
Then won't be no questions.
She'll know you a man!

1078
01:39:57,190 --> 01:39:59,317
- A real killer!
- Don't say that to me!

1079
01:39:59,425 --> 01:40:02,121
I'm too old to play house or cowboys.

1080
01:40:03,796 --> 01:40:06,731
You gonna do it or get out of my face.

1081
01:40:09,235 --> 01:40:10,361
Go on.

1082
01:40:11,237 --> 01:40:12,397
Do it!

1083
01:40:13,573 --> 01:40:15,336
Ronnie. Ronnie.

1084
01:40:17,076 --> 01:40:20,910
Ronnie, baby, look at me.
Ronnie, look at me. Look at me.

1085
01:40:21,014 --> 01:40:22,572
Come on, look at me.

1086
01:40:22,682 --> 01:40:26,778
Baby, it's all right. I got you. I got you.

1087
01:40:26,886 --> 01:40:29,821
Come on. Come on.

1088
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:36,754
Hold on. Hold on, baby.

1089
01:40:38,798 --> 01:40:40,493
- Hey, it's me.
- It's okay.

1090
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:42,727
I need you to get over here.

1091
01:40:43,469 --> 01:40:45,027
Yeah, right now!

1092
01:40:55,682 --> 01:40:58,276
We did a lot of dreaming, me and Rae.

1093
01:41:00,653 --> 01:41:02,644
Made big plans to get out.

1094
01:41:07,894 --> 01:41:11,887
I'd go do my tour and move out of here.

1095
01:41:14,834 --> 01:41:16,665
Maybe go to Knoxville.

1096
01:41:26,212 --> 01:41:27,577
But when Rae

1097
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:30,541
gets like she does

1098
01:41:33,119 --> 01:41:34,814
and does the things

1099
01:41:36,756 --> 01:41:38,348
that she does...

1100
01:41:43,263 --> 01:41:45,254
Go on, Ronnie. Go on.

1101
01:41:45,365 --> 01:41:49,165
- This is fucking stupid.
- Go on.

1102
01:41:50,903 --> 01:41:53,633
What Rae did for me,

1103
01:41:57,977 --> 01:41:59,444
she fixed me.

1104
01:42:06,252 --> 01:42:07,981
But I can't fix her.

1105
01:42:12,659 --> 01:42:13,683
Rae,

1106
01:42:15,295 --> 01:42:18,389
we don't wanna fix you or judge you.

1107
01:42:19,632 --> 01:42:21,964
Only you and the good Lord can do that.

1108
01:42:23,036 --> 01:42:26,199
But I want you to tell me
about these spells you get.

1109
01:42:30,910 --> 01:42:32,104
Well,

1110
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:37,074
I get these thoughts in my head,
you know.

1111
01:42:39,118 --> 01:42:43,111
Like shit I done
or shit that's been done to me,

1112
01:42:43,222 --> 01:42:45,850
and I can't get them out.

1113
01:42:46,426 --> 01:42:49,259
And it burns, you know, it hurts.

1114
01:42:49,362 --> 01:42:53,230
It starts in my head
and moves down to my hands,

1115
01:42:53,333 --> 01:42:57,497
and my stomach, and then lower, and...

1116
01:42:59,572 --> 01:43:05,010
You know, sometimes I can stop them
but mostly I can't.

1117
01:43:06,012 --> 01:43:08,242
The only thing that ever
made that feel better was Ronnie

1118
01:43:08,348 --> 01:43:10,009
'cause I love him so much.

1119
01:43:11,851 --> 01:43:15,947
Why don't you look at Ronnie
and tell him how you feel?

1120
01:43:31,704 --> 01:43:34,366
I think... I think we're fucked up.

1121
01:43:35,675 --> 01:43:38,200
Both of us. I mean, I know I am.

1122
01:43:40,646 --> 01:43:44,446
But that don't mean
that what I feel isn't real,

1123
01:43:44,951 --> 01:43:47,010
that I can't love somebody.

1124
01:43:49,322 --> 01:43:55,056
And I know how I've been
and what I've done is real, real bad.

1125
01:43:56,162 --> 01:43:57,322
But...

1126
01:44:06,639 --> 01:44:09,335
So if you wanna quit on me,
I understand.

1127
01:44:10,977 --> 01:44:12,501
But please don't.

1128
01:44:16,849 --> 01:44:17,941
So,

1129
01:44:19,919 --> 01:44:22,319
what you two gonna do about this?

1130
01:44:38,337 --> 01:44:39,929
Hi, Miss Angie.

1131
01:44:40,039 --> 01:44:44,533
You wasn't at your work
so I just figured I'd drop by.

1132
01:44:44,644 --> 01:44:46,111
What you need?

1133
01:44:47,413 --> 01:44:49,278
I need your help again.

1134
01:44:50,116 --> 01:44:51,674
More cough syrup?

1135
01:44:53,786 --> 01:44:55,014
Come on.

1136
01:45:00,059 --> 01:45:01,219
Shit.

1137
01:45:03,463 --> 01:45:04,828
You Ronnie?

1138
01:45:06,766 --> 01:45:07,790
Yeah.

1139
01:45:07,900 --> 01:45:10,596
I'm Lincoln.
I'm gonna be your best man.

1140
01:45:11,704 --> 01:45:12,796
Okay.

1141
01:45:13,306 --> 01:45:16,742
You having trouble with that tie?
'Cause I'm pretty good at it.

1142
01:45:23,516 --> 01:45:26,713
Gotta do it like this
or I'll get all turned around.

1143
01:45:31,924 --> 01:45:34,722
Laz, she's ready.

1144
01:45:40,566 --> 01:45:42,158
Ain't she pretty?

1145
01:45:42,702 --> 01:45:45,102
I'll give y'all some time together.

1146
01:45:51,777 --> 01:45:53,540
Now that is sharp!

1147
01:45:54,213 --> 01:45:56,704
Girl, you sharp as a tack.

1148
01:45:56,816 --> 01:45:58,875
Old Miss Ella Mae done you right,
didn't she?

1149
01:45:58,985 --> 01:46:00,646
- Yeah.
- You like it?

1150
01:46:00,753 --> 01:46:02,220
I've had nice things before

1151
01:46:02,321 --> 01:46:04,551
but, you know,
I always seem to ruin them somehow.

1152
01:46:04,657 --> 01:46:08,184
This here one yours.
I know you gonna take care of it.

1153
01:46:08,294 --> 01:46:11,752
- I'm gonna try. But, Laz...
- Hey, hey.

1154
01:46:11,864 --> 01:46:15,459
We ain't gonna have
no talk like that today, all right?

1155
01:46:15,568 --> 01:46:19,436
You and me, we gonna get through this.
We gonna be just fine.

1156
01:46:20,773 --> 01:46:23,264
You go on and live your life.

1157
01:46:23,376 --> 01:46:27,039
Get your shit together and live your life.

1158
01:46:28,114 --> 01:46:29,172
Okay.

1159
01:46:35,154 --> 01:46:37,554
I don't want you to let go of me.

1160
01:46:38,758 --> 01:46:40,089
You and me,

1161
01:46:41,594 --> 01:46:43,994
we always gonna have hope
to each other.

1162
01:46:51,237 --> 01:46:55,697
<i>When I was a child, I talked like a child,</i>

1163
01:46:55,808 --> 01:47:00,438
<i>I thought like a child,</i>
<i>I reasoned like a child.</i>

1164
01:47:01,514 --> 01:47:06,315
<i>When I became a man,</i>
<i>I put aside my childish ways.</i>

1165
01:47:07,453 --> 01:47:10,149
All right. You got her now.

1166
01:47:11,958 --> 01:47:14,085
<i>And now these three remain,</i>

1167
01:47:15,528 --> 01:47:20,522
<i>faith, hope and love.</i>

1168
01:47:21,067 --> 01:47:24,093
<i>But the greatest of these is love.</i>

1169
01:48:48,054 --> 01:48:49,248
Ronnie?

1170
01:48:50,923 --> 01:48:52,254
I gotta pull over.

1171
01:49:33,199 --> 01:49:34,257
Okay.

1172
01:49:35,735 --> 01:49:36,793
Okay.

1173
01:49:38,037 --> 01:49:39,095
Okay.

1174
01:49:40,973 --> 01:49:43,373
<i>This little light of mine</i>

1175
01:49:43,476 --> 01:49:46,377
<i>I'm gonna let it shine</i>

1176
01:49:46,479 --> 01:49:48,970

<i>Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine</i>

1181
01:50:06,332 --> 01:50:07,629
Baby.

1182
01:50:09,702 --> 01:50:10,760
See?

1183
01:50:11,504 --> 01:50:13,096
See? We're okay.

1184
01:50:13,773 --> 01:50:15,104
We're okay.
