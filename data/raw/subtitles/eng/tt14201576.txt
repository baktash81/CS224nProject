00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:39,000
- Early start, Professor?
- Yeah.

3
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:41,033
I guess we're not following
dive protocols today.

4
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:42,733
- Thanks, Gitundu.
- Right? OK!

5
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:44,067
Sorry!

6
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,167
And good morning
to you too, Abby!

7
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,767
How you going, little fella?

8
00:03:58,767 --> 00:04:00,100
You miss me?

9
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:35,267
It's not good news, I'm afraid.

10
00:04:36,933 --> 00:04:39,067
Your home's dying

11
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,933
and I don't know how to help.

12
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,000
Abby?

13
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
Hey, you've got a call.

14
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:03,167
Oh, really? Thanks.

15
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,000
Hi. Is this Abby Jackson?

16
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:06,167
Yes.

17
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,567
This is Dr Levine from

18
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,500
the Longboat Bay Hospital
in Western Australia.

19
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:13,033
Apologies about
the different time zones,

20
00:05:13,067 --> 00:05:15,100
but your mother's here with us.

21
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:16,900
She's suffered a stroke.

22
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:19,733
How severe was it?
Is she stable?

23
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:21,900
She's awake now and stable,

24
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:24,600
but she's unable
to speak at this stage.

25
00:05:24,633 --> 00:05:26,667
We were hoping
you'd be able to get here.

26
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,967
Yes, of course.
I... I need to be there.

27
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,600
- Thanks for... for finding me.
- Yes, of course.

28
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:35,300
- And letting me know.
- Thanks, Abby.

29
00:05:39,567 --> 00:05:42,567
Abby? Everything OK?

30
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,833
Something's come up.

31
00:05:44,867 --> 00:05:46,567
My mum's had a stroke.

32
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:49,500
You need to go back home.

33
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:15,733
Abby?

34
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:19,133
Abby!

35
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,867
Come on, sleepy head.

36
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,433
Mum, I was dreaming.

37
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,433
Congratulations, Abby.

38
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:45,733
You're awake.

39
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,133
Come on.

40
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:51,800
- Today is the day.
- My birthday?

41
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,667
- You're eight years old.
- Yeah.

42
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:57,233
You know what that means?

43
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:02,300
Come on!

44
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:06,833
Maybe not this year.

45
00:07:06,867 --> 00:07:08,367
Mum!

46
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,533
- Mum...
- Come on.

47
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,233
Whoo!

48
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,367
That's where you're going.

49
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,200
I can't, Mum. It's too far.

50
00:08:00,867 --> 00:08:02,367
It's just a warm-up.

51
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,900
Abby, you're a big girl now

52
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:09,900
and you've been
swimming like a fish

53
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:13,033
since you were
18 months old, yeah?

54
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:19,300
No, Mum. Please don't.

55
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,333
No, Mum! No!

56
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,133
You're gonna have to try now.

57
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:46,567
Alright?

58
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,433
Straight down, follow the chain.

59
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,300
- Equalise.
- OK.

60
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,833
Just glide.

61
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,400
You got it?

62
00:10:15,433 --> 00:10:17,000
I did it.

63
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,900
Come in.
Come here. Come up.

64
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:22,967
Oh, I'm so, so proud
of you, alright?

65
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,367
Now I know you can
swim that deep...

66
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,767
Yeah.

67
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,476
There's something
I want you to see, alright?

68
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,800
OK.

69
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,667
- Come here.
- I did it.

70
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,433
So this here is Robber's Head.

71
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:05,067
Now, the reef splits apart here

72
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,767
so there's caves
and crevices who knows where,

73
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,100
far too deep for you and me.

74
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:14,733
This is the deepest
part of the bay.

75
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,667
- You up for it?
- Yeah.

76
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,133
Right. OK.

77
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:30,800
Weight belts for this dive.

78
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,300
And, remember, we only take...

79
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:38,267
one abalone in three.

80
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,800
That way, they'll still be here

81
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:44,267
for your children's
children to fish.

82
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:47,967
Are you coming?

83
00:12:54,467 --> 00:12:55,967
Ohh!

84
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,343
Mum, get in the boat.
There's something down there.

85
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:12,600
It's OK, love.

86
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:14,433
- It nearly got me.
- Come on, Abby.

87
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:16,200
- Abby, Abby, take a look.
- No, Mum.

88
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:18,473
- Just please get in the boat.
- Abby, Abby, Abby, quick.

89
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:35,733
- I thought it was a shark.
- No.

90
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:37,233
That's a groper.

91
00:13:37,267 --> 00:13:40,900
Come on. Let's go say hello.

92
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,033
I really can't believe it.

93
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,600
He's big enough
to eat your arm off.

94
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,300
Must be old to grow that big.

95
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,267
Yep.

96
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,700
Gropers can live
until their 70s.

97
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:21,600
Old and wise.

98
00:15:21,633 --> 00:15:24,267
You must have made him
feel safe, Abs.

99
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:27,067
He'll always be safe with me.

100
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:31,600
Well, the only way
to make sure he's safe...

101
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:34,867
is to keep him a secret.

102
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,367
You see, gropers,

103
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,500
they live in the same place
most of their life.

104
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:41,733
They don't tend to leave.

105
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,167
Blueback.

106
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:50,833
We'll call him Blueback

107
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:54,400
and keep him a secret forever.

108
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:56,300
Blueback?

109
00:15:58,067 --> 00:16:00,133
I like that.

110
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,300
- Thanks.
- See ya.

111
00:16:18,267 --> 00:16:19,667
What are you doing here?

112
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,233
Briggs, you lunatic.

113
00:16:21,267 --> 00:16:23,867
Professor,
some of us still live here.

114
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,833
Don't 'professor' me.

115
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,167
- You alright?
- Yeah, thanks, Briggs.

116
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,800
Give me your bag.

117
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,333
The first stroke wasn't
so bad. You know Dora.

118
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:46,800
She said she felt
"a bit ordinary" after a swim.

119
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,900
Didn't even go to the doctor's
till the next day,

120
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:50,467
and that was in April.

121
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,400
Then...

122
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:54,967
she was out by Robber's Head.

123
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,267
What do you think
she was doing there?

124
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,167
I don't know.

125
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,267
Looking for whales again.

126
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:04,133
A bit secretive, your mum.

127
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:06,733
A bit sly, the Jacksons.

128
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,300
Anyway...

129
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,667
it doesn't look too good, Abby.

130
00:17:19,633 --> 00:17:21,867
They said she might
not speak again.

131
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:25,667
We'll see about that.

132
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:31,733
So what do you reckon?

133
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:33,933
Check out the abalone guy?

134
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,800
The compressor's on.

135
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:47,567
He must be under the water.

136
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,700
Mum, you can't just get
in someone's boat uninvited.

137
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:54,767
He's taking too many.

138
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,767
That's like
breaking into someone's house.

139
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,767
Yeah, he's got a licence.
He knows the rules.

140
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,300
Macka!

141
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,533
Hey, Macka!

142
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:07,433
Come on, ya old dog!

143
00:18:07,467 --> 00:18:08,967
Macka!

144
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:20,567
Dora, what in the living hell
are you doing?

145
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,000
You right there?

146
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:23,600
Give a man
a heart attack, you will.

147
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:26,433
Sorry to board
your vessel uninvited, Macka.

148
00:18:26,467 --> 00:18:29,067
Oh, you don't look too sorry.

149
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,433
You're taking too many.

150
00:18:30,467 --> 00:18:32,800
I mean, you know how long
they take to grow.

151
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,933
You're gonna strip this bay
in no time if you keep this up.

152
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:37,567
It's not as bad as it looks.

153
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,067
It's pretty simple, really.

154
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,967
Well, I'm a simple bloke

155
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
so that's the best news
I've heard all day.

156
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,033
Now, are you the sheriff
or the deputy today?

157
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:49,333
I think I'm the deputy.

158
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,800
Anyway, I know this
looks a bit crook,

159
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,633
but it's not as bad
as it seems, honestly.

160
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:55,909
Some of this
stuff's from Henry's.

161
00:18:55,933 --> 00:18:57,509
- Mm-hm.
- Some of it is from the Bluffs.

162
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:59,967
It's a full day's work there.

163
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah, alright.
Shouldn't they be on ice, then?

164
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:04,867
Yeah, it should be on ice.
We should all be on ice.

165
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,167
I'm getting a bit sweaty
in my wetty.

166
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,100
- On a day like this?
- Yeah.

167
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:12,100
How is the water?

168
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:14,800
It's up about a degree,
a degree and a half, I reckon.

169
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,633
- Jeez.
- Sure is warm.

170
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:21,133
Righto, if you two
high-sea bandits are finished,

171
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:23,067
I've got some
gastropods to harvest,

172
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,133
in a sustainable manner,
of course,

173
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:28,800
in line with all the relevant
health and safety protocols.

174
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
- He can be a bit rough.
- I like him.

175
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:42,533
- He's not that scary.
- OK.

176
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,633
Mrs Jackson.

177
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,133
Ted Costello.

178
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,267
Wonderful view.

179
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,767
Well, Ted Costello,
I'm sure you'll enjoy it

180
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,500
just as much from the car
on your way home.

181
00:20:05,033 --> 00:20:07,200
I'm just here
to drop off a proposal.

182
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:10,033
I left it on your kitchen table.

183
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,700
Door was open. I called out.

184
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:19,333
We don't normally need
to lock our doors around here.

185
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:23,733
Doesn't mean we expect people
to just walk in uninvited.

186
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,533
Worth taking a look.

187
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:30,067
No rush, though.

188
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,533
We're not going anywhere.

189
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:34,800
Your neighbours
all seem very interested.

190
00:20:43,767 --> 00:20:45,500
We're here, Abby.

191
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:49,433
You want me to come in?

192
00:20:49,467 --> 00:20:51,300
Thanks, Briggs.

193
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,833
I can take it from here.

194
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:56,200
What happens if they won't
let you take her home?

195
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,200
Well, I feel sorry for the fella
that says no to you.

196
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,500
Come on, sleepy head.

197
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,333
I'm gonna take you home.

198
00:21:30,633 --> 00:21:32,067
Mum?

199
00:21:33,467 --> 00:21:34,933
It's me.

200
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,100
Here.

201
00:22:10,467 --> 00:22:12,000
Hey.

202
00:22:22,233 --> 00:22:23,433
Come on.

203
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:30,367
I figured
you might need some supplies.

204
00:22:33,967 --> 00:22:35,567
Thanks.

205
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,233
I... I guess I'll leave you two
villains up to your mischief.

206
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:43,400
OK.

207
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,900
Mum.

208
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:08,067
Do you remember the drawings?

209
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:11,500
This was my first.

210
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:15,267
Mum?

211
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,733
See ya.

212
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,733
And here she is.

213
00:26:38,767 --> 00:26:41,400
Seven minutes late. New record.

214
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,567
Come on. Come on!
Time to make up.

215
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:50,067
Been getting many
fish out there?

216
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,900
Yeah, some here
and there. You know how it is.

217
00:26:52,933 --> 00:26:54,733
Like where, for instance?

218
00:26:54,767 --> 00:26:56,433
Fish are where
you find 'em, Merv.

219
00:26:56,467 --> 00:26:58,267
Right!

220
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,300
You Jacksons, I tell ya,

221
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:02,167
the old apple don't fall
far from the tree.

222
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,667
You gotta give my love to Dora.

223
00:27:27,267 --> 00:27:28,400
- G'day, Merv.
- Morning.

224
00:27:28,433 --> 00:27:29,867
- Hi, Merv.
- Morning, Merv.

225
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,200
- G'day, Briggs.
- Hey.

226
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:32,567
- Morning, lads.
- Morning, Merv.

227
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,200
Come on, kids. Let's go!

228
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,800
Any ideas?

229
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:53,633
Yeah, it's a banksia.

230
00:27:53,667 --> 00:27:56,633
I've seen this one
growing down Wilder's Road too.

231
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:58,200
There's heaps down my place.

232
00:27:58,233 --> 00:28:00,033
Red. Blue. Yellow.

233
00:28:00,067 --> 00:28:02,767
It's a Banksia attenuata,

234
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,200
or 'biara' as it's known in
the local Indigenous language.

235
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:08,900
Go on. Try and draw it.

236
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:13,833
Briggs! Abby!

237
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,967
Wait here.

238
00:28:29,467 --> 00:28:31,333
What's going on?

239
00:28:31,367 --> 00:28:33,433
The entry to the bay
is too shallow.

240
00:28:33,467 --> 00:28:35,300
They need to dredge the reef,

241
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:37,933
create an entry point
for larger boats.

242
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,300
Mum said they need to pass

243
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,500
an environmental assessment.

244
00:28:41,533 --> 00:28:43,567
The development
isn't even approved yet.

245
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,533
I don't think they're worried
about needing an approval.

246
00:28:50,267 --> 00:28:52,433
Where are you going?

247
00:28:52,467 --> 00:28:54,633
- Abby!
- See ya, Merv!

248
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:57,900
Oi! What am I
supposed to tell your mum?

249
00:28:57,933 --> 00:29:00,267
Wait for me.

250
00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:16,200
Hi, Mum!

251
00:29:16,233 --> 00:29:18,200
Hey. Good day at school?

252
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,433
The salmon's in, at last.

253
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:39,900
Here you go.

254
00:29:39,933 --> 00:29:41,633
Yeah, alright.
Thanks, love.

255
00:29:49,033 --> 00:29:50,333
- Hey, Dad.
- G'day, mate.

256
00:29:50,367 --> 00:29:51,700
- Abby.
- Hey.

257
00:29:51,733 --> 00:29:53,700
Come on.
I'm gonna show you something.

258
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,000
Don't be late!

259
00:30:14,033 --> 00:30:15,867
It's a blue whale.

260
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,633
The biggest animal
on the planet.

261
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:25,100
This was just a calf, I think.

262
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,033
They must get pretty big, hey?

263
00:30:34,733 --> 00:30:36,467
Dad said
there were whalers here.

264
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,100
Like, way back.

265
00:30:39,133 --> 00:30:40,667
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

266
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,467
There used to be so many whales,
you could walk across them.

267
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,867
Blues, humpbacks, right whales.

268
00:30:50,867 --> 00:30:52,200
Have you seen one?

269
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,800
Sort of. Not really.

270
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:01,500
Just like a white puff
in the distance.

271
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,833
Dad says we're killing
a big hole in the world,

272
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:08,667
all of us...

273
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,900
and we're all gonna
fall into it together.

274
00:31:11,933 --> 00:31:13,933
You sure he hasn't
been talking to my mum?

275
00:31:13,967 --> 00:31:15,333
I'd like to see that.

276
00:31:15,367 --> 00:31:16,433
Yeah.

277
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,500
So we were just about
to send out a search party.

278
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:29,200
Sorry, Mrs Jackson. Hey, Dad.

279
00:31:29,233 --> 00:31:31,533
Got the heads-up from Merv
you might be down here.

280
00:31:31,567 --> 00:31:33,200
Sorry, OK?

281
00:31:33,233 --> 00:31:35,967
Briggs just wanted to
show me something. That's all.

282
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,700
Well, the good news is...

283
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:42,300
we get a free feed.

284
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:45,100

349
00:35:05,633 --> 00:35:07,367
Mum said he could
come back with, like,

350
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,400
a year's money
in just a few months.

351
00:35:10,467 --> 00:35:13,733
But, I mean, he hated it.

352
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:16,500
He worked so hard

353
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:18,833
just to make a life for us.

354
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:23,633
And then one year...

355
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:25,100
one year came around

356
00:35:25,133 --> 00:35:28,300
when he just didn't
come home after the season.

357
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:34,367
They found his mask
at the bottom of Roebuck Bay.

358
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:38,233
They just never found his body.

359
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,200
So the sea took him?

360
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,200
A tiger shark most likely.

361
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,033
I mean, that's what they said.

362
00:36:10,133 --> 00:36:13,167
Really? Not a word?

363
00:36:16,367 --> 00:36:19,500
You are so damn stubborn.

364
00:36:38,033 --> 00:36:39,700
OK.

365
00:36:40,767 --> 00:36:43,433
What have we here?

366
00:36:44,433 --> 00:36:46,200
A letter from the prime minister

367
00:36:46,233 --> 00:36:50,700
and a copy
of your letter to him.

368
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:54,300
You're being way too polite.

369
00:36:55,367 --> 00:36:57,567
My personal favourite.

370
00:37:01,267 --> 00:37:03,167
Did you get any takers?

371
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,533
OK. One last thing.

372
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,233
The dolphin,

373
00:37:09,267 --> 00:37:11,300
from the protest.

374
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:18,667
Remember this?

375
00:37:20,133 --> 00:37:22,033
Mum! Seriously!

376
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,600
I was a coward.

377
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,033
It killed me.

378
00:37:32,067 --> 00:37:34,100
Save our bay!

379
00:37:34,133 --> 00:37:35,600
- You can breathe?
- Yeah.

380
00:37:35,633 --> 00:37:37,133
It's not too tight?

381
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:38,633
Yeah, that's it, Merv.

382
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:41,167
- You can't get free?
- No, it's good, mate.

383
00:37:46,867 --> 00:37:48,500
Save our homes!

384
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:50,267
Save our bay!

385
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,267
Save our bay!
Save our bay!

386
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,800
OK, we're in. It's done.

387
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:56,567
What do you want me
to do with this?

388
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,367
- Eat it, Merv.
- I'm not eating it. I'm not.

389
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,267
Take it to the ocean,
chuck it in.

390
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,633
OK.

391
00:38:01,667 --> 00:38:03,900
Save our bay!
Save our bay!

392
00:38:03,933 --> 00:38:05,567
Run, Merv! Run!

393
00:38:07,633 --> 00:38:09,433
Come on, Dora.

394
00:38:09,467 --> 00:38:11,267
You've had your fun.
This is pointless.

395
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,867
You know what's in this truck?

396
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,667
- What?
- Ammonium nitrate.

397
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,133
That's what's in it.

398
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:17,733
It's your bay too, mate!

399
00:38:17,767 --> 00:38:19,300
- Settle down!
- Save our bay!

400
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:24,033
Save our bay!
Save our bay! Save our bay!

401
00:38:24,067 --> 00:38:28,833
Save our bay! Save our bay!
Save our bay!

402
00:38:28,867 --> 00:38:30,667
Save our bay!

403
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,567
Save our bay!
Save our bay!

404
00:38:45,633 --> 00:38:47,900
- Thanks, Ray.
- See you.

405
00:38:47,933 --> 00:38:50,433
Say hi to the missus
for me, will you?

406
00:38:50,467 --> 00:38:52,133
Will do.

407
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,300
Hey.

408
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,733
You were there today?

409
00:39:08,733 --> 00:39:10,367
At the protest?

410
00:39:11,467 --> 00:39:13,100
You know I was there.

411
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:14,633
No, I didn't.

412
00:39:15,933 --> 00:39:18,633
- Must have been hiding, yeah?
- No, I was there.

413
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:22,300
When it comes to standing up
for what you believe,

414
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:24,667
there is no place
for cowards, Abby.

415
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,067
I'm not a coward, Mum!

416
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,000
Yeah? It didn't seem
that way to me.

417
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:29,300
I'm not a coward!

418
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:30,833
And your dad
would've agreed with me!

419
00:39:30,867 --> 00:39:33,133
Well, that's real mature,
bringing Dad into this!

420
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,300
Hey, Mum.

421
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,133
I just came to say
that I'm sorry.

422
00:40:18,033 --> 00:40:20,133
Day's not over yet.

423
00:40:22,367 --> 00:40:25,400
Should we go find
the old blue bandit?

424
00:40:27,033 --> 00:40:29,267
- Yeah.
- Come on, bub. Come on.

425
00:40:30,733 --> 00:40:32,767
- I'm sorry too.
- It's all good.

426
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,667
- You alright?
- Don't worry about it.

427
00:43:07,667 --> 00:43:10,367
Do you reckon we can get her
out on the open water again?

428
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,133
I'm not so sure.

429
00:43:14,167 --> 00:43:16,600
Come on. You used to be
able to fix anything.

430
00:43:17,867 --> 00:43:19,733
I can give it a try.

431
00:43:19,767 --> 00:43:22,133
Do you think you might
go to Robber's Head?

432
00:43:24,933 --> 00:43:26,633
I'm not sure if I'm up for that.

433
00:43:36,133 --> 00:43:39,267
Hey, you reckon we should
do a quick check-up on Macka?

434
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,867
Yeah.

435
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,333
Hey, Macka!

436
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:50,900
Hooroo!

437
00:43:52,167 --> 00:43:53,500
- Look out!
- Hello.

438
00:43:53,533 --> 00:43:54,967
Ducks on the pond.

439
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,533
Oh, pirate ducks at that.

440
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:57,900
Hey, you know those fireworks

441
00:43:57,933 --> 00:43:59,267
you had the other night, yeah?

442
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,767
I think they're
actually illegal.

443
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,867
Oh, no! You gonna
call the authorities?

444
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,200
I was thinking about it.

445
00:44:06,233 --> 00:44:07,476
How you doing down there, Macka?

446
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,300
I was going OK
till I had a visitor.

447
00:44:09,333 --> 00:44:11,967
Oh, well, if that's how
you feel, we can just leave.

448
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,400
Nah, I'm not talking about you.

449
00:44:13,433 --> 00:44:15,433
I'm talking about a man
in a sharp grey suit.

450
00:44:15,467 --> 00:44:17,433
A shark?
What kind of shark?

451
00:44:17,467 --> 00:44:19,967
Well, the kind you
step out of the dance for,

452
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,333
if you know what I mean,

453
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,167
discretion being
the better part of valour.

454
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,467
A great white.

455
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,567
Pretty great,
pretty white, pretty big.

456
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:29,943
With all this fresh meat
lying around,

457
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,600
I didn't want to tempt him.

458
00:44:31,633 --> 00:44:34,500
Didn't want to, uh, put his
good manners to the test.

459
00:44:34,533 --> 00:44:37,233
They say I'm a bit tapped,
ladies, but I'm not that mad.

460
00:44:37,267 --> 00:44:39,367
Seems pretty sensible, Macka.

461
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,100
Oh, look out.
Mum's agreeing with me.

462
00:44:41,133 --> 00:44:43,233
"Dear diary," hey?

463
00:44:43,267 --> 00:44:44,933
Before you go...

464
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,967
they tell me
that this is the favourite

465
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,033
of the old Achoerodus gouldii.

466
00:44:51,067 --> 00:44:53,100
I beg your pardon, the what?

467
00:44:53,133 --> 00:44:55,967
Groper, western blue.

468
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,267
Scoffs my popcorn apparently.

469
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,767
We don't catch groper.

470
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,767
Well, most people don't.
Can't say I do myself.

471
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,567
Well, then,
what are the crabs for?

472
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,867
Well, because every old man

473
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,033
likes a snack
every now and then, Dora.

474
00:45:08,067 --> 00:45:09,900
You know about Blueback,
don't ya?

475
00:45:10,867 --> 00:45:12,067
Blueback?

476
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,033
That's a nice name.

477
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,367
Righto, if you
reprobates are finished,

478
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,733
I'm gonna go finish off

479
00:45:19,767 --> 00:45:21,833
this beautiful little snack
I prepared for myself,

480
00:45:21,867 --> 00:45:23,533
and then I'm gonna go...

481
00:45:23,567 --> 00:45:25,600
back in and check
if old mate's still around.

482
00:45:25,633 --> 00:45:28,700
Come on, mate. Why don't you
just get your boat out of here?

483
00:45:28,733 --> 00:45:30,333
Take it out west somewhere.

484
00:45:30,367 --> 00:45:33,467
I'm big enough and old enough
to look after myself.

485
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,376
Besides, I've always thought
when the time's right

486
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,300
for that sort of thing,
the time's right.

487
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:39,467
Know what I mean?

488
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,309
No point worrying about
things you can't control.

489
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:43,167
Isn't that right, Abby?

490
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:45,767
Yeah.

491
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,800
Righto, back to work.

492
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,000
Take care, Macka.

493
00:45:54,033 --> 00:45:56,433
- Hooroo.
- Hooroo!

494
00:46:02,933 --> 00:46:05,200
Looks like
we've had visitors again...

495
00:46:07,433 --> 00:46:10,233
laying out their
surveyor's posts.

496
00:46:11,467 --> 00:46:14,700
Planning out where
they're gonna build

497
00:46:14,733 --> 00:46:17,267
when we finally give in.

498
00:46:18,633 --> 00:46:22,000
Well... not today.

499
00:46:24,633 --> 00:46:25,933
Bye-bye!

500
00:46:25,967 --> 00:46:29,633
Yeah. That's the end
of that, then.

501
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:36,167
What are you reading?

502
00:46:38,333 --> 00:46:41,467
Um, it's a marine encyclopedia.

503
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,667
Mr Carlisle lent it to me.

504
00:46:44,667 --> 00:46:46,200
To prepare for the new school.

505
00:46:47,133 --> 00:46:49,700
Western blue groper.

506
00:46:49,733 --> 00:46:52,267
Achoerodus gouldii?

507
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,433
Yeah.

508
00:46:53,467 --> 00:46:55,100
A leafy seadragon.

509
00:46:55,133 --> 00:46:57,300
A Phycodurus...

510
00:46:57,333 --> 00:46:59,033
a Phycodurus eques.

511
00:46:59,067 --> 00:47:02,067
What kind of a name is it
if you can't even say it?

512
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,133
And the southern rock lobster,

513
00:47:06,167 --> 00:47:09,100
Jasus ed... edwardsii.

514
00:47:11,967 --> 00:47:14,833
So Briggs said the salmon
didn't come in on time?

515
00:47:14,867 --> 00:47:17,467
Yeah, I spoke to Merv
the other day.

516
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,300
Yeah?

517
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:21,400
He said that
the sardines are dead

518
00:47:21,433 --> 00:47:23,667
all the way down the coast.

519
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:27,500
And a dead leopard seal
came in from Antarctica.

520
00:47:27,533 --> 00:47:30,567
So there's something going on.

521
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,833
You'd think
there'd be some way to,

522
00:47:34,867 --> 00:47:36,600
you know, read all these signs.

523
00:47:36,633 --> 00:47:38,333
It's a puzzle.

524
00:47:39,333 --> 00:47:40,733
With an answer?

525
00:47:41,767 --> 00:47:43,633
Yeah, there's always an answer.

526
00:47:51,167 --> 00:47:52,867
Storm's coming.

527
00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:02,600
Hey, Mum!

528
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,900
Macka's still out diving.
He should come in.

529
00:48:11,933 --> 00:48:13,267
Let me see.

530
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,367
I think
the compressor's stopped.

531
00:48:19,767 --> 00:48:21,267
Abby, come on.

532
00:48:29,867 --> 00:48:32,933
Macka! Macka!

533
00:48:32,967 --> 00:48:34,667
Macka?

534
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,867
The compressor's low on fuel.

535
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,133
- Reckon you can get it going?
- Yeah, I think so.

536
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,533
Macka? Macka?

537
00:48:50,533 --> 00:48:55,067
Do not get in the water, Abby.
Stay on the boat.

538
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,700
- You understand?
- Do you think it's a shark?

539
00:48:57,733 --> 00:48:59,533
Stay on the boat.

540
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:06,600
Come on!

541
00:49:06,633 --> 00:49:08,333
Come on, please!

542
00:49:08,367 --> 00:49:09,667
Come on!

543
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,433
Won't be needing that.

544
00:49:41,967 --> 00:49:43,433
Was it that shark?

545
00:49:45,233 --> 00:49:47,033
No, he's just floating
along the bottom.

546
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,700
I reckon he's had
a heart attack.

547
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,267
So he's dead?

548
00:50:01,233 --> 00:50:02,867
Yeah, love.

549
00:50:05,367 --> 00:50:06,667
He's drowned.

550
00:50:13,567 --> 00:50:15,367
I'm sorry.

551
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,800
This isn't gonna
be nice, but, um...

552
00:50:20,867 --> 00:50:23,833
I want you to tie off that rope.

553
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,467
I'll go down and secure him

554
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,300
and when I come back up,

555
00:50:29,333 --> 00:50:31,867
we're both gonna have to pull.

556
00:50:51,233 --> 00:50:53,200
OK, alright.

557
00:50:53,233 --> 00:50:56,100
Thanks for checking. OK. Bye.

558
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,700
Oh, Mum...

559
00:52:08,367 --> 00:52:09,800
Gitundu.

560
00:52:09,833 --> 00:52:11,300
Hi, Abby.

561
00:52:11,333 --> 00:52:13,033
How's your mum?

562
00:52:13,067 --> 00:52:14,500
OK.

563
00:52:14,533 --> 00:52:17,067
Not great, but it's good
to be here with her.

564
00:52:18,033 --> 00:52:19,867
And the reef?
Any news from the survey?

565
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:22,933
That's why I'm calling.

566
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,200
The drones came in
this afternoon.

567
00:52:26,233 --> 00:52:27,933
The bleaching...

568
00:52:27,967 --> 00:52:29,900
Miles of it.

569
00:52:30,833 --> 00:52:33,267
More than we ever predicted.

570
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,233
It's dying.

571
00:52:35,267 --> 00:52:37,333
The whole reef will be gone.

572
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,300
We really need you here.

573
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,100
When are you coming back?

574
00:52:47,133 --> 00:52:48,700
I'm not sure.

575
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:52,000
About anything.

576
00:52:53,367 --> 00:52:55,033
Abby?

577
00:52:59,233 --> 00:53:01,167
Sorry, Gitundu.

578
00:54:29,133 --> 00:54:33,367
So I saw these amazing
leafy seadragons

579
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,300
down at the point yesterday.

580
00:54:35,333 --> 00:54:37,033
Mm?

581
00:54:37,067 --> 00:54:38,933
Never seen them before.

582
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:45,400
Oh, come on, Jackson!
Let's get wet. Come on.

583
00:54:45,433 --> 00:54:48,100
Come on! Your new school
can wait.

584
00:55:46,767 --> 00:55:49,367
That's a reef stripper
if ever I've seen one.

585
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,400
They have the abalone licence.

586
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:54,433
Poor old Macka's
only just left us.

587
00:55:56,667 --> 00:55:58,933
We need to keep
an eye on Robber's Head.

588
00:55:58,967 --> 00:56:02,200
Blueback, he...
he's a big target.

589
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:04,433
Yeah, I'm gonna
have a word with them.

590
00:56:04,467 --> 00:56:06,233
With a boat that size,

591
00:56:06,267 --> 00:56:09,000
they should be fishing
in open water.

592
00:56:14,133 --> 00:56:18,200
This is the most stupid and
dangerous thing we could do.

593
00:56:18,233 --> 00:56:21,967
You told me, Mum, "To do nothing
would be twice as stupid

594
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,400
"and twice as dangerous."

595
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,067
True.

596
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:53,833
Abby!

597
00:57:04,167 --> 00:57:06,000
Hey, Mum, come up here.

598
00:57:12,567 --> 00:57:14,333
It's not just abalone.

599
00:57:14,367 --> 00:57:16,733
And so many undersized ones.

600
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:18,167
It's hard to be discerning

601
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,833
when you're stripping a reef.

602
00:57:21,633 --> 00:57:24,133
And these fish...

603
00:57:24,167 --> 00:57:26,667
Some of them are
meant to be protected.

604
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,267
How can they do this, Mum?

605
00:57:29,833 --> 00:57:33,000
I'm gonna go down and see
what they're doing down there.

606
00:57:34,767 --> 00:57:37,633
I want you to stay on our boat.
You understand, Abby?

607
00:57:37,667 --> 00:57:40,700
'Cause some of these fish
have been speared.

608
00:59:22,533 --> 00:59:24,733
Bring it up.

609
00:59:26,833 --> 00:59:28,500
Bring it on.

610
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,667
- Mrs Jackson.
- Costello!

611
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:34,567
I thought you'd have
something to do with this.

612
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:37,400
You're drag-netting
open-water style.

613
00:59:37,433 --> 00:59:40,833
You're gonna fish
the reef out completely!

614
00:59:40,867 --> 00:59:43,433
You don't want to talk about
it? No, didn't think you would.

615
00:59:43,467 --> 00:59:46,133
- Don't worry about her.
- Maybe your guys do. Guys?

616
00:59:46,167 --> 00:59:48,400
Do you realise exactly
what you're doing here?

617
00:59:48,433 --> 00:59:50,033
Just ignore her.

618
00:59:50,067 --> 00:59:51,747
You're gonna strip this
entire ecosystem...

619
00:59:52,867 --> 00:59:54,367
of marine life, so your boss

620
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,200
can push his agenda
through council.

621
00:59:57,233 --> 00:59:59,433
So why don't we talk
about spear guns?

622
00:59:59,467 --> 01:00:01,933
There's a whole range
of protected species here.

623
01:00:01,967 --> 01:00:04,500
Any of you blockheads
know which ones they are?

624
01:00:04,533 --> 01:00:06,733
No? Didn't think so.

625
01:00:06,767 --> 01:00:09,633
Well, I'd be asking
my boss if I were you.

626
01:00:09,667 --> 01:00:11,767
Hey, Mum, there's someone
on Macka's boat.

627
01:00:13,667 --> 01:00:15,600
Alright. Let's get out
of here. Come on.

628
01:00:15,633 --> 01:00:17,333
Sleazebag.

629
01:00:22,167 --> 01:00:23,667
Hey.

630
01:00:24,833 --> 01:00:26,900
What were you doing
on Macka's boat?

631
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:31,400
That boat's still good
in open water?

632
01:00:31,433 --> 01:00:33,500
Yeah, sure is.

633
01:00:33,533 --> 01:00:35,467
Smooth as, even in a storm.

634
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,367
Even in a storm.

635
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,000
- You feel safe on it?
- Yeah.

636
01:00:39,033 --> 01:00:41,600
The man who owned it
took it out every day.

637
01:00:43,467 --> 01:00:44,867
What was he like?

638
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,900
The man that
took it out every day?

639
01:00:50,067 --> 01:00:51,467
Well, his name was Macka.

640
01:00:52,433 --> 01:00:54,833
And people called him Mad Macka.

641
01:00:56,833 --> 01:00:58,600
Maybe I did too.

642
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:01,333
But I liked him.

643
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:03,900
Abby?

644
01:01:05,067 --> 01:01:08,133
Why don't you head back up
and get the meal going?

645
01:01:08,167 --> 01:01:11,067
I'll... I'll deal with this.

646
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,533
She helped me pull him up.

647
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:25,367
Big thing for anyone,
seeing death for the first time.

648
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,867
Well, I'm grateful
for what you both did.

649
01:01:28,933 --> 01:01:30,467
Did you know Macka?

650
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:34,800
He was my dad.

651
01:01:40,133 --> 01:01:41,633
Abby!

652
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,567
It's yours.

653
01:01:47,533 --> 01:01:49,067
He would've loved
you to have it.

654
01:02:21,267 --> 01:02:23,200
Are you really sure
that I can have it?

655
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:25,967
Macka's son. He said you could.

656
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,367
Oh, wow!
What do you reckon?

657
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,133
That's an engine, alright.

658
01:02:39,167 --> 01:02:42,733
Alright? A bit rusty, but we
could work on it together.

659
01:02:42,767 --> 01:02:44,933
Make it feel like yours, then.

660
01:02:47,733 --> 01:02:49,233
Oh, yeah.

661
01:02:50,467 --> 01:02:52,767
I can't wait.

662
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,333
OK, where are the tools?

663
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,333
Abby?

664
01:03:02,333 --> 01:03:03,633
Hey?

665
01:03:03,667 --> 01:03:05,367
Here. Look.

666
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:27,867
- Is that his son?
- Yeah.

667
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,600
Looks just like him.

668
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,167
Do you know that the sea holds
more artefacts and remnants

669
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,433
of our history then all
the museums in the world?

670
01:03:46,533 --> 01:03:48,800
And Mad Macka
has most of them in here.

671
01:03:50,033 --> 01:03:51,467
What's this?

672
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:52,800
Careful.

673
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:56,900
Oh! It's an otolith.

674
01:03:58,033 --> 01:03:59,700
I've only seen a picture of one.

675
01:04:00,667 --> 01:04:02,133
What is it?

676
01:04:02,167 --> 01:04:03,933
It's a skeleton of an ear.

677
01:04:06,267 --> 01:04:07,867
The ear of a blue groper.

678
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,267
See? Here are the lines
along it, yeah?

679
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:14,033
- There?
- Yeah.

680
01:04:15,467 --> 01:04:17,833
Well, it grows
a layer each year.

681
01:04:19,833 --> 01:04:21,433
You can tell how old it is.

682
01:04:22,867 --> 01:04:24,233
He was really old.

683
01:04:24,267 --> 01:04:26,300
Like, really old.

684
01:04:26,333 --> 01:04:28,867
How do you know
that he was a he?

685
01:04:32,533 --> 01:04:37,133
Well, you see, all blue gropers
are born as girls...

686
01:04:38,167 --> 01:04:39,700
and they start off green.

687
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:44,667
And it's only when puberty hits
that they change colour

688
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:46,600
and some of them become boys.

689
01:05:10,267 --> 01:05:12,000
I want to show you something.

690
01:05:14,033 --> 01:05:16,533
Someone, actually.

691
01:05:16,567 --> 01:05:18,633
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

692
01:05:18,667 --> 01:05:20,333
Alright. Come on.

693
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:28,067
Now, the throttle
will flood the engine

694
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:29,733
if you're too hard
on the old girl.

695
01:05:29,767 --> 01:05:31,200
- You feel that?
- Like this?

696
01:05:31,233 --> 01:05:33,767
That's it. You got it.

697
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,300
Yeah.

698
01:05:44,233 --> 01:05:45,733
Come on.

699
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,433
What'd you think?

700
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:36,533
Oh, that was amazing.

701
01:07:36,567 --> 01:07:38,100
So cool!

702
01:07:39,133 --> 01:07:40,833
Hey, Mum, you alright?

703
01:07:40,867 --> 01:07:43,267
Yeah.
I'm gonna head home.

704
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:46,433
I gotta figure out
what Costello's next move is.

705
01:07:47,567 --> 01:07:49,833
I'm gonna
see you back at the house.

706
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,800
- Before sunset this time, yeah?
- OK, yeah.

707
01:08:15,433 --> 01:08:17,900
Doesn't look like
they've started dredging yet.

708
01:08:17,933 --> 01:08:20,233
Maybe the protests
slowed them down.

709
01:08:34,867 --> 01:08:36,676
Just make sure
everyone's there in the morning,

710
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:38,233
all the machinery's ready to go,

711
01:08:38,267 --> 01:08:40,476
and I'll see you after the
council meeting, if not before.

712
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,300
Yeah, no worries.
See you in the morning.

713
01:08:54,167 --> 01:08:56,000
I think she looks better.

714
01:08:56,033 --> 01:08:58,267
Yeah, well, happier.

715
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:01,067
She still hasn't
said a word, though.

716
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:04,433
The doctor said the chance of
another stroke is so high now.

717
01:09:04,467 --> 01:09:05,667
Yeah, I know.

718
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:07,633
That's it's just
a matter of time.

719
01:09:08,933 --> 01:09:11,167
Time is all we have, Abby.

720
01:09:14,167 --> 01:09:17,267
I'm sorry it's been so long.

721
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:21,267
There were my studies and all
the opportunities overseas...

722
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:23,800
It's fine, Abby. We were fine.

723
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:25,100
You know Dora.

724
01:09:25,133 --> 01:09:26,333
She kept us up to date

725
01:09:26,367 --> 01:09:27,700
with everything you were doing,

726
01:09:27,733 --> 01:09:29,367
you know,
read each letter out aloud.

727
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:32,400
You know, she's very
proud of you. Very proud.

728
01:09:32,433 --> 01:09:35,267
We are very proud of you.

729
01:10:15,733 --> 01:10:17,333
Hey, Dad.

730
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:28,033
How you been?

731
01:10:35,167 --> 01:10:37,000
I'm worried.

732
01:10:41,133 --> 01:10:43,767
I don't know if Mum
can stop them this time.

733
01:10:46,533 --> 01:10:48,533
And I wish I knew how to help.

734
01:10:53,333 --> 01:10:55,200
I really miss you.

735
01:11:14,233 --> 01:11:15,667
Mum.

736
01:11:24,133 --> 01:11:25,633
Well?

737
01:11:29,167 --> 01:11:30,500
Well...

738
01:11:30,533 --> 01:11:32,800
I just need
to finish this proposal

739
01:11:32,833 --> 01:11:34,533
for the council tomorrow.

740
01:11:34,567 --> 01:11:36,233
Come on. What do you think?

741
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:42,967
I think there's as good
a school as any right here.

742
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,567
Well, yeah, but two years there
and I can head to university.

743
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:47,600
It just...

744
01:11:47,633 --> 01:11:49,067
It feels like
you're trying to get

745
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:51,367
as far away from me as you can.

746
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:55,733
Come on.
You know you can visit.

747
01:11:55,767 --> 01:11:57,567
Maybe live with me over there.

748
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,467
If I leave here,
this house of ours

749
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:03,900
will be bought by developers
and Costello will win.

750
01:12:03,933 --> 01:12:07,333
Look, I want to save
the world's oceans, Mum,

751
01:12:07,367 --> 01:12:09,833
and I can't learn everything
I need to at the school here.

752
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:13,500
Abby, this is your home,
alright? You were born here.

753
01:12:13,533 --> 01:12:15,967
Your father was born here.
Your grandparents. I just...

754
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,067
I don't understand what
you think you're gonna do

755
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:20,167
on the other side
of the world by yourself.

756
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:21,833
Just come with me.

757
01:12:21,867 --> 01:12:25,567
You and me, we can make
a difference together.

758
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:32,333
Sweetheart, what do you think
I have been doing here

759
01:12:32,367 --> 01:12:35,267
my whole life?

760
01:12:51,067 --> 01:12:52,933
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

761
01:12:52,967 --> 01:12:56,367
You look good.
The uniform, all of it.

762
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:00,967
It's just...

763
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,667
It's really hard letting go.

764
01:14:33,933 --> 01:14:37,033
So I'm here to propose
a marine reserve

765
01:14:37,067 --> 01:14:39,367
to protect
the diversity of species

766
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:42,767
that we have right here
in this bay.

767
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,600
This diversity,
tell us about it.

768
01:14:46,633 --> 01:14:48,467
What threatens it?

769
01:14:50,167 --> 01:14:54,100
Well, I'm not... that good
at all this kind of talk.

770
01:14:55,133 --> 01:14:58,200
I live on the bay
so I've seen what's going on

771
01:14:58,233 --> 01:15:01,933
and right now,
there are men overfishing...

772
01:15:14,267 --> 01:15:15,800
Your mum still
banging on in there?

773
01:15:18,467 --> 01:15:19,633
I'm up next.

774
01:15:21,333 --> 01:15:22,967
That's how it works.

775
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,800
She speaks and then I get

776
01:15:24,833 --> 01:15:26,900
an equal chance
to argue my case.

777
01:15:27,833 --> 01:15:29,233
Fair enough, don't you think?

778
01:15:29,267 --> 01:15:31,633
You and your mum really think
you can stop this.

779
01:15:31,667 --> 01:15:33,400
- Don't you?
- Yeah.

780
01:15:33,433 --> 01:15:35,233
That's not how it works.

781
01:15:35,267 --> 01:15:38,767
You see, governments, they pay
attention to short-term gains.

782
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,367
Jobs. Economic activity.

783
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,700
They need to get re-elected.

784
01:15:49,733 --> 01:15:51,033
I'll vote.

785
01:15:52,333 --> 01:15:53,933
To stop them.

786
01:15:55,733 --> 01:15:57,400
To stop you.

787
01:16:01,467 --> 01:16:03,067
Not until you're 18.

788
01:16:14,167 --> 01:16:15,733
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

789
01:16:15,767 --> 01:16:17,833
that's just stealing from...

790
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,000
stealing from our future.

791
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:29,000
My name is Abby Jackson.

792
01:16:29,033 --> 01:16:31,100
Hello, Abby.

793
01:16:33,267 --> 01:16:34,933
And I'm 15 years old.

794
01:16:35,933 --> 01:16:38,400
I've been studying
this bay since I was 8.

795
01:16:39,867 --> 01:16:41,333
Since then,
I've been documenting

796
01:16:41,367 --> 01:16:43,667
the unique marine life
in the bay.

797
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:46,433
This here is a redlip morwong.

798
01:16:46,467 --> 01:16:49,433
And there are three different
types of these seadragons,

799
01:16:49,467 --> 01:16:51,100
three,

800
01:16:51,133 --> 01:16:54,100
one of which is only found here,

801
01:16:54,133 --> 01:16:57,267
this incredibly rare
leafy seadragon.

802
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:59,233
And each and every one of them

803
01:16:59,267 --> 01:17:01,900
is threatened by Costello's
planned development.

804
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,633
And we have larger fish,

805
01:17:05,667 --> 01:17:08,433
like the western blue groper,

806
01:17:08,467 --> 01:17:10,667
or Achoerodus gouldii.

807
01:17:11,767 --> 01:17:14,667
They just love
the moderate temperatures.

808
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:16,833
They nestle here in... in reefs

809
01:17:16,867 --> 01:17:19,733
as havens from the weather
along the coastline.

810
01:17:23,133 --> 01:17:26,767
These pictures show us the many
species unique to this bay,

811
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:29,267
documented for the first time,

812
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:32,867
the diversity of this
marine life, that it's a...

813
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:35,167
I mean, it's a gift to us all.

814
01:17:36,167 --> 01:17:40,900
Well, we all welcome
your work, Abby,

815
01:17:40,933 --> 01:17:46,333
but do you believe that
we should make a decision today

816
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:52,000
based on the, uh...
the drawings of a child?

817
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,933
Hang on a minute, Abby.

818
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:27,633
Down at Robber's Head!

819
01:19:01,433 --> 01:19:02,767
Abby?

820
01:19:07,667 --> 01:19:08,900
Abby?

821
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,300
Abby!

822
01:22:35,233 --> 01:22:36,667
Abby!

823
01:23:42,667 --> 01:23:44,200
You stupid girl!

824
01:23:44,233 --> 01:23:46,200
I told you to stay
out of the water!

825
01:23:46,233 --> 01:23:48,473
- They've got spear guns, Abby!
- I had to save him, Mum!

826
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:50,409
- They could've killed ya!
- I had to save Blueback.

827
01:23:50,433 --> 01:23:51,943
- There was no other choice.
- Oh, Abby!

828
01:23:51,967 --> 01:23:54,167
He just wanted to play, Mum.

829
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:55,600
I was running out of air.

830
01:23:55,633 --> 01:23:57,267
Those men,
they wanted to kill him.

831
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:59,600
So what happened?
Did he get away?

832
01:23:59,633 --> 01:24:01,500
Well...

833
01:24:01,533 --> 01:24:03,333
- Well?
- Well, I hit him one.

834
01:24:03,367 --> 01:24:06,800
I... I punched him, OK?
Just to scare him off.

835
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:10,800
Don't laugh, OK?

836
01:24:10,833 --> 01:24:12,500
- It's not funny.
- Oh, God.

837
01:24:12,533 --> 01:24:14,843
You know, he's probably got
some big black eye or something.

838
01:24:14,867 --> 01:24:17,400
Oh, get on the boat. Come on.

839
01:24:17,433 --> 01:24:19,767
He's gonna hate me now.
That's for sure.

840
01:24:20,767 --> 01:24:22,700
OK, so let's
start with the, uh...

841
01:24:22,733 --> 01:24:25,200
with the spear guns
and the fact that that kid

842
01:24:25,233 --> 01:24:26,967
was nearly killed
by one of your blokes.

843
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,243
Yeah, look,
I'm very disappointed

844
01:24:28,267 --> 01:24:29,433
about the spear guns.

845
01:24:29,467 --> 01:24:31,500
I didn't know these guys
were doing this.

846
01:24:31,533 --> 01:24:33,833
So what's gonna happen now?

847
01:24:33,867 --> 01:24:36,400
Well, they breached
the fishing limits

848
01:24:36,433 --> 01:24:37,900
set by their licence.

849
01:24:37,933 --> 01:24:40,600
Turns out that spear guns

850
01:24:40,633 --> 01:24:43,000
aren't typically used
for fishing abalone

851
01:24:43,033 --> 01:24:47,033
and almost spearing
a teenage girl

852
01:24:47,067 --> 01:24:50,233
is... is reckless endangerment.

853
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:55,700
And today?

854
01:24:56,633 --> 01:24:58,567
- How'd it go after I left?
- Well...

855
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:02,100
There was six of them
that had to vote.

856
01:25:03,067 --> 01:25:06,300
Five of them
had hearts of stone.

857
01:25:06,333 --> 01:25:08,200
There was one, though.

858
01:25:08,233 --> 01:25:11,133
That woman from the
other side of Cockatoo Bay.

859
01:25:11,167 --> 01:25:12,433
Yeah?

860
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:15,267
She saw the sense in it.

861
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:20,767
It was you that did it, Abby.

862
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,200
Not me.

863
01:25:22,233 --> 01:25:23,667
It was your pictures.

864
01:25:24,633 --> 01:25:26,367
Your research.

865
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,867
Just one vote?

866
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:29,567
Oh...

867
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,167
Just one for now.

868
01:25:32,333 --> 01:25:35,567
Next time two, then another,

869
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,900
then another,

870
01:25:37,933 --> 01:25:39,400
then another...

871
01:26:05,067 --> 01:26:06,367
They're here.

872
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,467
Where's Dora?

873
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:10,667
Dora! Dora, come on,
come on. Dora!

874
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:17,367
- See 'em?
- Yeah.

875
01:26:26,667 --> 01:26:28,167
Thank you.

876
01:26:30,767 --> 01:26:34,100
Ahh, yeah, yeah,
there's about eight of them.

877
01:26:34,133 --> 01:26:36,300
Humpbacks!

878
01:26:36,333 --> 01:26:37,967
New babies too.

879
01:26:39,133 --> 01:26:42,267
Mrs J, is that why you were
down at Robber's Head?

880
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:44,376
'Cause you were waiting
for this mob to come through?

881
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,367
Patient as ever.

882
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:49,867
And you know
the best place to view 'em?

883
01:26:50,833 --> 01:26:51,933
Right here.

884
01:26:53,367 --> 01:26:56,533
Alright, Mrs J, let's have
a look for some more.

885
01:26:56,567 --> 01:26:59,200
I reckon there's a few
out there lingering.

886
01:27:01,633 --> 01:27:04,733
Whoa! Oh, look at that!

887
01:27:05,967 --> 01:27:08,133
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

888
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:06,333
You kept them, Mum.

889
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:08,833
Where were they?

890
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:18,333
He never came back, did he, Mum?

891
01:28:22,933 --> 01:28:24,567
I saved him sure enough.

892
01:28:25,533 --> 01:28:27,267
But I never saw him again.

893
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:30,833
I truly believed
he would have shared

894
01:28:30,867 --> 01:28:32,967
the secrets
of the sea with me...

895
01:28:34,467 --> 01:28:36,267
if only he'd come back.

896
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,700
Come on.

897
01:30:13,833 --> 01:30:15,833
When you were born...

898
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:19,767
we took you down
while the water was warm...

899
01:30:20,767 --> 01:30:23,533
and lowered you gently
into the waves.

900
01:30:26,067 --> 01:30:27,767
Jack and me.

901
01:30:28,867 --> 01:30:31,900
We couldn't keep
you out of the water.

902
01:30:40,767 --> 01:30:43,267
We come from water.

903
01:30:51,133 --> 01:30:53,167
We belong to it, Abby.

904
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,900
What if he doesn't come back?

905
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:05,400
If I never see him again, hey?

906
01:31:05,433 --> 01:31:07,700
Well, you saved him, Abby.

907
01:31:07,733 --> 01:31:09,867
That's the main thing.

908
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:13,100
If that's the cost,
then it was worth it.

909
01:31:16,467 --> 01:31:20,800
You ever notice that
just before the sun sets,

910
01:31:20,833 --> 01:31:22,767
beyond the horizon...

911
01:31:24,233 --> 01:31:28,300
the sun burns even brighter
just for an instant,

912
01:31:28,333 --> 01:31:30,800
lights up the whole sky?

913
01:31:34,167 --> 01:31:36,233
Yeah, it does.

914
01:31:39,233 --> 01:31:42,900
One last beautiful hurrah.

915
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:46,900
Then it's gone.

916
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:04,233
We are gathered here today,

917
01:32:04,267 --> 01:32:07,533
looking out across
her beloved bay,

918
01:32:07,567 --> 01:32:10,667
to celebrate the life
of Dora Jackson.

919
01:32:12,533 --> 01:32:14,333
Dora devoted her life

920
01:32:14,367 --> 01:32:17,767
to establishing a marine reserve
for future generations

921
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:19,600
that stretches from here

922
01:32:19,633 --> 01:32:22,167
all the way out
to Robber's Head.

923
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:24,600
A safe place at last.

924
01:32:25,767 --> 01:32:29,700
She wanted more of them,
other havens along the coast,

925
01:32:29,733 --> 01:32:32,833
but for now, as she came
to the end of her life,

926
01:32:32,867 --> 01:32:35,800
she was content with
everything she had achieved.

927
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:39,833
And as we say farewell
to our dear friend,

928
01:32:39,867 --> 01:32:43,067
I thought I'd play
a very special song

929
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:45,633

Abby!

Gitundu, you would
not believe it here.

950
01:34:30,067 --> 01:34:32,467
My mum's marine reserve
is thriving.

951
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:35,300
I saw a huge pod
of humpback whales.

952
01:34:35,333 --> 01:34:37,400
Every day, there are
whales off the shore.

953
01:34:37,433 --> 01:34:39,200
Amazing.

954
01:34:39,233 --> 01:34:41,200
A marine reserve?
That's incredible, Abby.

955
01:34:41,233 --> 01:34:43,367
And it's beautiful.

956
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:44,767

we've got some work to do.

960

Great.

Take a good close look

964
01:34:56,267 --> 01:34:57,900
