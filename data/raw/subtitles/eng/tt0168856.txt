Going fishing!

4
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,819
Fly, wait!

5
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,049
Hello Fly.

6
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:03,613

here. Lisa, Bill, you can run along now.

7
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,818
Honey your dad and l are going out,
Aunt Anna is going to baby-sit Stella,

8
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,812
and your cousin Chuck is here too.

9
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,891
Oh... man... !!

10
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,369
Bye Bye Mommy! Bye Daddy!

11
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,179
Bye honey! Boys be good!

12
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:37,217
Grethel went straight to Hansel,
opened the stable door and cried...

13
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,973
Read faster... or else l'll fall asleep!

14
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,494
What?! Oh yes...

15
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,130
Well Einstein, got any decent games?

16
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,769
l'm calculating the length
of a DNA molecule.

17
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,571
Hey! lt's a millenium 2000 PMX!

18
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,572
- This is a really cool machine!
- Hey, hey give...

19
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,333
- And a power processor!
- Give it to me!

20
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,411
Relax, Chuckie...
l'm just checking it out.

21
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,252
No... Fly! Don't!!!

22
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,809
No! Fly don't hit Escape!

23
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,371
What? Ooops! Escape... why not?

24
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,289
Well, Madame?
Do you like the make up?

25
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,899
Okay!

26
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:21,211
You're lucky l made a back-up. Do you have
any idea what would have happened if...

27
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,495
...Chill out Chuckie,
nothing happened!!!

28
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,410
Hi Fly!!

29
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,898
Errhh, weren't you
supposed to be sleeping?

30
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,493
Aunt Anna's on my bed.

31
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,491
All right! l'm out of here!

32
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,332
Hey Chuck, where're you going?

33
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,899
To wake my mom.

34
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,696
Oh no you're not.

35
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,777
Hey... give it back!

36
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,299
Guess where you're going?

37
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,769
l'm not going anywhere.
Now give it back!

38
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,134
You are coming fishing with me!!

39
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,810
Not in a million years!

40
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,655
l definatly think you are...

41
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,492
No Fly... Nooo...

42
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,331
lsn't this just totally cool... !

43
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,368
l've got a bite! Hey Chuck!
Come on over and give me a hand!

44
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,169
l can't swi...--
l mean we're not allowed to...

45
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,057
Come on! Get a move on!

46
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,136
Or are you scared?

47
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,172
Little fishy!

48
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,649
lt's a Hippocampus Vulgaris.

49
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,495
No it isn't. lt's a girl.
l'm going to call her Sasha!

50
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,571
lt has to go back in the water, Stella.

51
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,935
Here give to me.

52
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,016
No... !

53
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,494
Stella, come on.

54
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,019
She's mine.

55
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,491
She'll die if you don't put her back.

56
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,531
l, l think we'd better go home now.

57
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,014
Let's go, Stella.

58
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,334
Uhh! The tide...

59
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,531
Fly! Help... ahh!

60
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,295
Fly... Fly!
What do we do?

61
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,656
Fly?

62
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,654
Fly, where are you?
Fly!! Come back!

63
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,130
FLYYY!

64
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,730
Hey Chuck! Check this place out!
lt's unbelievable!

65
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,014
That tunnel might get us back to shore.

66
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,138
Hey! Look at this!

67
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,008
Professor McCrill.

68
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,730
Uh, a Ph. D. in marine biology! Wow...

69
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,169
Fly!

70
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,058
Fly, l'm thirsty.

71
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,256
This professor guy
can show us the way out.

72
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,089
Ah, maybe we should go. A brilliant scientist
probably won't like being disturbed

73
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,171
by ordinary people like us...

74
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:12,256
Check out this fish ''Californian Fly fish''.
Hey that's a good lokking fish!

75
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,773
Fly... l'm thirsty.

76
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,299
Sh... !
Whats that?

77
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,419
Fly... who's that man?

78
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,097
l'm, who am l oh...
l,um... hmm, now what was it?

79
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,256
Professor H.O. McCrill.

80
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,657
Wel... welcome.
Well... Welcome! l'm a professor too!

81
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,699
You must come and
see my new experiment...

82
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,176
Due to climatic changes
in the Earth's atmosphere,

83
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,975
the north and south polar
icecaps will melt in the

84
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:11,329
Course of the next century, resulting in
a total loss of arable and habitable land.

85
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:17,530
The resulting increase of sea level will be
32,000 into the square root... hmm.

86
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:24,094
1 78,885 feet, plus or minus seventeen point
three feet depending on relative humidity.

87
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,171
Oh... Correct! Professor...

88
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,217
l've made a marvelous discovery,
Professor Chuck.

89
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,933
lt will make it possible for human beings
to survive under water!

90
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:43,369
Ha ha ha ha! Now let me show
you how to mix... fish potion.

91
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:48,457
first you take some... errrm what was it?
Dum dum dum de dum!

92
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:54,210
...Cod fish whiskers! Now l've go it!
My memory is not what it used to be...

93
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,573
this is why l made this song.

94
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:34,491
Start the camera!
This moment must be immortalized!

95
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,055
Camera's running... Action!!

96
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,457
finally. fhe time has come!

97
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,329
Stupid me l almost forgot! Oh no no.

98
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,853
Silly me... silly me.

99
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:09,095
Here's the antidote l have made.
This potion is almost the same,

100
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:16,530
but in order to reverse the process,
you have to add some ground-up kelp.

101
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,336
Huh... Lemonade!

102
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:02,250
Oh no, no, no! Holy bouillabaisse!

103
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,415
The pump! The pump!
Oh my god the pump stopped.

104
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,613
Ahh! The generator! Oh Quick!!

105
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,977
Oh oh got it... !

106
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,898
Ahhh, that's done it...uhh.

107
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,615
You see professor Chuck,
this system circulates

108
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:27,689
fresh sea-water to my fish around the clock.
Without it they die.

109
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,249
See here?
l pumb it up directly from the ocean.

110
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,774
Hey you guys!
Any of you seen Stella?

111
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,690
Who...?

112
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,577
No... not in the last six minutes.

113
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,775
Stella!

114
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,055
Stella... !

115
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,136
Hey... Stella...

116
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,568
Stella, huh? Whoa..

117
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,736
Stella, where are you?

118
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,776
Hey Chuck.
Check out the silly fish.

119
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,892
lt's a Starfish.
lt'll dry out-put it in water.

120
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,853
Stella now this isn't
the time to hide and seek.

121
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,530
Stella! Come out,
come out, wherever you are!

122
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,173
Whoa!!!

123
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,732
Hmm... it's still running...

124
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:17,775
Let's see... ! Huh! Oh my, oh... oh... no...

125
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,056
Hey... fLY! Hey... Fly...

126
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,499
Noooo!!!!!

127
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:31,418
Stop... Fly NOOOOO!!

128
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,379
Nothing! l can't see anything.

129
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:47,337
Argh... forget it! lf we can't see her,
then there's only one thing to do!

130
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:54,531
STOP!! Wait! lf you don't get the antidote
within 48 hours, you'll be a fish forever!

131
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,379
Fly...

132
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,530
No...

133
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,648
Take my hand!

134
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,694
Help!

135
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,892
l can't swim!

136
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,976
Help!

137
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,335
Drink... the... Potion...

138
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,130
Huh! Charles? Stella?

139
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:14,614
Fly? Where are you?

140
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:22,456
Stella!! Stella!!

141
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,336
Duh.. ! Wha' happened?
Who... what wa... that sound?

142
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:10,896
Ba ba ba ba ba l believe we have acquired
the power of speech, my voracious friend.

143
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,049
Huh?

144
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,248

145
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,572
What a deeeelicious beverage...

146
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,455
Can you feel the power?
Can you taste it?

147
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,970
Taste it...? Ah! food!

148
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,452
Hey, clean muh teeth...
There's stuff in the cracks!

149
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:43,489
Henceforth, oral hygiene
is no longer my department.

150
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,576
What?!!

151
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,379
l DON'T CLEAN ANY MORE!
Try dental floss.

152
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,250
from now on l call the shots.

153
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:57,253
With this brain power,
l can have fame! fortune! Servants!

00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,488
Oh man!!!!

177
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,658
We don't have time for jokes!

178
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,372
Chuck, what are you looking for?

179
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:04,930
You know what? l finally figured you out,
Chuck... l can see right through you!!

180
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,895
When you're through making wise cracks,
maybe you can help me find the antidote?

181
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:14,539
Tehh, heh... the what?
The anti-dote?

182
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,135
What do you mean find the antidote?!

183
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,978
Chuck! What happened!?

184
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:25,213
The storm got worse...
and the boat sank.

185
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,736
- What?!
- l... l can't swim.

186
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,657
Why didn't you say so before?

187
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:38,858
l had to drink the potion... the antidote
sank... and l turned into a jellyfish.

188
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,970
l think you're a cute Jellyfish.

189
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,608
What about the Professor?

190
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,855
He was in the water...
l think he sank too.

191
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:52,895
- Drowned? - I swear I'm putting on weight
I've got to cut down on the kelp.

192
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,690
You old Tubby...

193
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,493
It seems like only yesterday I was in School

194
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:01,937
...you know interesting isn't it how things
change evolution for example,

195
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,296
it seems like it took the fast lane.

196
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,692
Yesterday, we were swimming
everywhere ourselves,

197
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,175
and today we get to take a bus.

198
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,576
And it's already five minutes late!

199
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,772
Excuse me how come you can all speak?

200
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,738
Well you speak yourself, you should know.

201
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,498
Well l... er...

202
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:25,218
lt's like this, we all owe our present
capabilities to Joe and his magic potion.

203
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,015
Joe???

204
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:27,856
Potion???

205
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:32,889
You should hear Joe talk.
He's so inspiring!

206
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:36,609
Oh, l hope there is room
for us at the meeting.

207
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,336
What does this potion look like?
ls it in a square bottle...?

208
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,172
Oh looky, there here she comes...

209
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,415
About time too.

210
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:48,215
Hey mister where's
your manners, ladies first.

211
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,569
Thank you dear.

212
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,849
That will be 2 clams
and five stones, madam.

213
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,854
Here! Keep the change!

214
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:06,016
Ahem! Just a second!
These are not valid!

215
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,016
Not valid?

216
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,249
You'll have to get off.

217
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,452
What...?
Chuck, give me your glasses!

218
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,698
Here then, have these trans
-Atlantic, trans-Pacific, worldwide-

219
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,931
oceanic approved deluxe coins.

220
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,059
Very well, then.
Here are the tickets.

221
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:25,413
Hold on! These two are less than
six years of age. They ride for free!

222
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,890
Oh yes, of course. Here's a refund.

223
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,609
And this poor fellow is half blind!
lt's not fair that he should pay full price.

224
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,059
Aaaah, well, yes,
l suppose that's right...

225
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,576
And while we're at it, could we sell back
the tickets we don't need?

226
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,731
Next time, have exact change.

227
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,971
And what would have happened
if it DlDN'T work, genius?

228
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,049
That's the symbol on the professors bottle.

229
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:38,171
All full! Next meeting at sundown.

230
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,459
We've got to get in there.
Quick, follow me!

231
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,409
Ehh! Hurry! Hop in!

232
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:23,815
''Once there waS only Silence

233
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,575
And not a Speck of hope in Sight

234
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,493
And every tiny bubble burSt

235
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,130
On itS journey to the light

236
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:42,219
But the Spark of creation will flicker again

237
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:47,690
It'S a brand new era about to begin... ''

238
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,010
The prince of the whales.

239
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,096
l am convinced!
His words are true!

240
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,415
Who's this?

241
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,690
Please let me follow you...

242
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,299
What a nice young fish.

243
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,212
l'll hold the bottle too...

244
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,376
Oh no, that won't be nessessary...

245
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,098
l insist!
Just let me hold it...

246
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,177
The bottle stays with me.

247
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,454
Just let me have a little sip.

248
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,976
No Fly! No! We're at the bottom
of the sea! You'll drown!

249
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,253
Arrest them!

250
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,776
Put 'em in that chair.
l'll attend to them shortly.

251
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,775
Excuse me for a moment.

252
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:17,098
No, that won't do at all.
l want the statue much bigger.

253
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,816
Don't carp at me about delays! l'll send you
a couple thousand more workers.

254
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:37,739
Sorry to have kept you waiting... Please...

255
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,934
... Have a snack...

256
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,893
Your enthusiasm at the meeting
touched me deeply.

257
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,058
l wish all of my followers
would show the same devotion.

258
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:51,448
Now tell me all you know
about this divine cocktail,

259
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,450
and l'll tell you about
my great plans for you.

260
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,929
Served in oyster sauce...

261
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,250
Excuse me just a moment...

262
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:06,212
first, we will have to obtain the recipe,
then you can eat them.

263
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,058
Oh, yeah!

264
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:14,258
l didn't mean to scare you little snacks...
er, l mean, guys, you little guys.

265
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,291
l looove little critters...

266
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,893
All right, that's enough.
Have some candy.

267
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,454
Candy. Thanks boss.

268
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:31,051
- Now where was l? Oh, yes of course.
The bottle. - Give it back! lt's ours!

269
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,259
Relax.

270
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,973
But we, we...

271
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,329
We had it first!

272
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,899
We... need it t-t-to
b-become h-h-human again...

273
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,652
We're not really fish! Honest!

274
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:47,738
That's right! You are something special...
l saw that right away.

275
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:51,654
This is a great opportunity for
a bright young fish like you.

276
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:57,293
There's no limit to what we can
accomplish together. lf you help me now.

277
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:05,652
Just tell me how to get
some more of this magical brew...

278
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:10,650
l don't know how. The professor drowned...
we lost the bottle...

279
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,851
he's the only one who knows how...

280
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:17,049
But l'm telling the truth!
You have the only potion left!

281
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,738
This will give you time
to think about things.

282
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,852
And to make sure
you think without distractions,

283
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,495
l'm going to remove your little pet--

284
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:34,569
And send it to the work camp!

285
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,418
SASHAAAA!!! NOOO!

286
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,013
What do you want from us?

287
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:45,978
The truth.
By tomorrow morning. Or else...

288
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,815
You're shark bait.

289
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,574
l love snacks...

290
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:37,248
One, two, three, four, five, six,...
One, two, three,...

291
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:42,619
This is it! We'll never get back in time.
We're doomed to be fish forever!

292
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,373
Well, don't just sit there!
Use that overdeveloped brain of yours!

293
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:52,855
One, two, three, four, five, six,...

294
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,731
Hey, you... Crab!

295
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,892
lt's against military regulations
for a guard to converse with the prisoners.

296
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,979
You are one poor excuse for
a soldier, buddy. Pret-ty wimpy.

297
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,214
Whaddaya mean wimpy?

298
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:07,179
A soldier is disciplined,
brave, and above all... Strong!

299
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,130
What!...

300
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:12,532
Well, for starters l bet your pathetic claw
can't even put a dent in this iron bar...

301
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:17,136
Oh yeah? Check this out!
Watchin'? Ready...?

302
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,972
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

303
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,733
Nah! Too easy...

304
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,493
Wait! Wait!...
What about this one?

305
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:22,972
Trivial!

306
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:28,009
No! This is the perfect test of your
strength! We're talkin' 100% titanium here!

307
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,970
NO! NOT THE KEY!

308
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:38,134
No, they haven't shown up yet...
you can't.

309
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,257
l understand that you have other cases,
but couldn't you...

310
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:42,817
Here let me...

311
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:47,815
Give it to me!!! Hello! Let me
tell you something, Mr. Police Officer!

312
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:51,575
- l'm a tax-paying citizen and
l can have you fired! - Anna...

313
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,410
Anna, give me the phone--

314
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,537
Not now! Can't you see
l'm busy saving our children!?

315
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,895
from trouble that
your son has caused...

316
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,095
My son has NOT...

317
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:03,412
No time to argue now! l expect you
to put your best men on the case!

318
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:11,015
Listen??!! No, you listen to me!

319
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,573
lf you don't find my little Charles,
and l mean fAST -

320
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:20,456
What??? Good bye? What do you mean,
Good bye? Hello? Hello!?

321
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,610
fools!

322
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,738
His fishing rod is missing.

323
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:30,574
And his spare lures that
must be where they went!

324
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:23,689
Praise your master! Now... !

325
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:35,451
My Monument! You idiots!
Build! Mend! Restore!

326
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,649
Fly!

327
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,335

331
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,810
No...

332
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:04,699
Oh no. Do you think that...?

333
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,528
No. They can't be...

334
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,412
Oh... No...

335
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,849
What is it?

336
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:22,735
Fly made this!
He showed it to me yesterday.

337
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,049
Charles...

338
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:36,498
One, two, three, four,...
One, two, three, four...

339
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,898
Hey you, Crab! Give me the key.

340
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:50,971
Or l'll... l'll use my magic powers
and turn you into a frog!

341
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:59,733
Wake up!!
Give me the key now or l'll...

342

Fly!
Sasha can help us!

344
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,857
Sasha's not here, Stella.

345
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,811
Sasha, get the key!

346
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,169
Sasha!

347
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,649
Sasha!

348
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:35,489
What a morning!
The sun rising on my Empire!

349
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,855
Yeah... Breakfast!

350
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,250
Sasha! Throw me the key!

351
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,013
Hey, Crab!

352
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,134
- Alright!
- ...Wait till l get my claws on you...

353
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,616
Breakfast...

354
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,659
Going somewhere?

355
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:38,938
Breakout! Huh? Who turned out the lights?
Where is everybody?

356
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,408
We're up here!

357
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,335
CHArrrggge!

358
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,057
Help!

359
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:47,657
- l gotcha! You little--
- Put me down! lt's me, you idiot...

360
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:51,489
Yeah, yeah, so you said
all night, you little pest!

361
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:56,057
Shark! The prisoners are escaping!

362
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:58,730
Go...

363
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:18,491
Useless bums! The pair of you! You're not fit
for sushi! l sentence you to... Execution!

364
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,411
Ahhh... What's that?

365
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:25,130
Shark! Chew up that useless Crab
and eat yourself when you're finished!

366
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,809
l mean, er...
No no, that won't do. My mistake...

367
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:39,532
Nobody has to execute themselves
in a civilized society... you!

368
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,979
Who? Me?

369
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:44,416
Yes, you. Because of your long
and loyal service to me,

370
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:47,817
l hereby appoint you...
Chief Executioner!

371
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:52,815
Oh thank you, sir!
Thank you, thank you, thank you...

372
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:59,536
On the other fin, we could just call it
water under the bridge.

373
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:04,452
A great leader is distinguished by
his ability to forgive.

374
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:09,650
Shark! l hereby appoint you,
Offensive Commander.

375
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:14,494
AttennnnttTlON!

376
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:23,209
Go and get those three infuriating fish
and bring them to me! NOW!!!!!

377
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:27,289
Fly, what do we do now?
We don't have the anti-dote...

378
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:33,419
the professer is dead, and he was
the only one who knew the formula!

379
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:39,816
...And the tiny whiskers of a codfish.

380
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,931
Can l have ketsup on mine?

381
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,377
Are you feeling all right?

382
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:54,290
Oh man, this is great!
We can make the antidote ourselves!

383
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,098
All the ingredients are under water.

384
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:01,618
Oh really? first, we need to find all the
ingredients, then backtrack about 50 miles;

385
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:06,774
we're 8 inches long, have only a 1 a day left
and its... lts impossible!!!!

386
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,134
You're forgetting something.

387
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,529
What's that?

388
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,935
The force is with us.

389
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:16,776
''Ready, Steady, gather, goI''

390
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,169
Fly... !

391
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:30,019
Excuse me!
Have you seen two boys and a little girl?

392
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:35,811
- Kids? Yes kids... Oh yes, kids! No kids!
- Hey stop! Wait! - fish! Two fish...

393
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,731
What's that you said?

394
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:46,331
find the fish, find the fish.

395
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,010
Professor Chuck.

396
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,295
You!

397
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:03,131
Where's my Charles?

398
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,414
Your Charles, Chuck yes.

399
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:07,979
You tell me or l'll tear you limb from limb.

400
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:12,531
Take it easy Anna. lf you kill the guy
he can't tell us where the kids are...

401
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:16,052
So tell me, where are our children?

402
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,895
They... er...
they turned into... fish...

403
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:24,498
- l'm not playing games with you mister!
Tell me! Where they are! - But... honestly...

404
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,810
- Where are my kids...?
- Please, listen to us...

405
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:31,138
l'll have the police on you,
kidnapping is a very serious offence...

406
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:34,010
See...

407
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:46,177
Now, all we need is an octopus...
and we'll be human again.

408
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,813
l'm almost gonna miss bein' a fish!

409
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:48,571
Fly... !

410
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,730
But a double cheeseburger oughta cure that!

411
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:51,970
Fly... !

412
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,408
Look what l found!

413
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:54,410
Fly!!

414
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,456
Neat, huh?

415
00:47:55,540 --> 00:48:01,012
FLY! Fly! Listen to me!
lf we find an octopus... and l say lf...

416
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:05,811
How're we gonna get it to spray ink?
An octopus is 30 times bigger than us...

417
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,777
and it only sprays ink when it's scared!

418
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:08,935
Hey! Look... there's a mirror!

419
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:11,375
Did you hear what l just said?

420
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,853
Look what we found!

421
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:18,619
Are you two out of your minds? lt'll be
sunset in half an hour! Did you hear me?

422
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:22,812
A half hour! We will never take another
breath of fresh air!... fish for life!

423
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:26,337
- Oh look what l found!
A waterproof watch! - Chuck...

424
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:28,854
- Look, l can use it for a belt--
- Chuck! Listen to me... --

425
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:31,454
Then l'll know exactly how much time
l have left before l'm doomed!

426
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:34,657
Chuck!! Listen! l've got a plan!

427
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:37,578
We scare the octopus with the mirror,
just like Confusius did.

428
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:41,899
Oh yeah? ls that all?
first we have to find one,

429
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:45,491
then we need to get it out
in the open, then we have to...

430
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:50,051
You are always about what won't work.
Why is everything you say so negative.

431
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:56,215
Well, unlike you, l use LOGlC. You think
you can just swim up to a huge octopus?

432
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,934
Are you guys fighting or just disgusting?

433
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:03,019
lt's okay, Stella. Chuck's just making sure
he doesn't miss an opportunity to moan.

434
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:07,579
And now... l'm gonna
find me an octopus! Adios!

435
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:22,969
Look into the mirror!

436
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,329
Help... !

437
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:30,415
Look in the mirror, creep!
Look in the mirror ahh...

438
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:35,015
Help!

439
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:49,170
lt swam away! lt got scared off
by our screams!

440
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:52,218
We got the last ingredient
for the potion! We're saved!

441
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:57,533
Fly, look! That's what scared the octopus!

442
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:05,811
Well, well, well...
l'm just in time for happy hour!

443
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:28,370
ls that you, Fly?... No. No good!

444
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:43,297
Well, my little smart aleck sardine...
Catfish got your tongue?

445
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:51,856
You didn't have any potion!
Oh, no! You just wouldn't co-operate...

446
00:50:56,820 --> 00:51:02,133
Empty! Oh, well... we can always
make some more...

447
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,978
...or you can die.

448
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,136
l'll smash it if you come any closer!

449
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:07,897
Stop!

450
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,174
Not another inch!

451
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:13,015
Now, now. Calm down.
Let's not be too hasty here!

452
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,898
Let Stella and Chuck go,
then... we'll talk.

453
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:18,448
No Fly! for once,
think before you speak!

454
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:25,537
Why not just eat the little jerks? We don't
need no potion. We're smart enough already.

455
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:34,490
My dear friend. My loyal commander.
Did you understand anything l told you

456
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:37,617
about my society of
exceptionally intelligent fish?

457
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:44,336
Oh... yes, yes!
l get it... lntelligent fish!

458
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:49,131
You get it?
Good. Now get this...

459
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:53,413
You're FIRED, you brainless,
saw toothed seaweed sucker!!

460
00:51:54,380 --> 00:52:02,139
My good friend, we have a job opening--
perfect for you: Commander of my minions.

461
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:05,895
Leader of this impressive
group of ldiot fish!

462
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:09,859
Sir permission to speak sir. lf l could just
have a moment of your valuable time...?

463
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,091
l think l know
just the right crab for the job--

464
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,655
Shut up! lf l wanted
your opinion l'd give it to you!!

465
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:17,852
Sir yes sir.
l mean sir no sir. l mean right sir.

466
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:21,815
This job is too important
for a chowder head like him.

467
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:26,929
No, l need fresh talent around here.
You, for example.

468
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:30,810
All you have to do is give me the potion...

469
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:32,254
That does it!

470
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:36,089
You promised! You did!

471
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:38,614
You're taking this the wrong way!

472
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,577
Here is our chance, Chuck!
Lets move!

473
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:44,449
- And how should l take it?
- They're getting away!

474
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,452
You stay put!

475
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,617
Fly! Drop it or he'll kill you!

476
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:35,097
forget Commander!
Now l m the ruler! l'm KlNG!

477
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:46,777
Troops!
Take your orders from me now!

478
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:50,176
l'm the one with the brains!
l'm in charge!

479
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:52,495
Fly! Are you okay?

480
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,611
Salute me!

481
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:57,453
Hail the Great Crab!
Hail the Great Crab!

482
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:02,291
Fly? You got a tummy ache?

483
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:07,290
Don't worry about me,
Stella... l'll be fine, really...

484
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:08,655
Fly...

485
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:13,214
Help... !

486
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:19,135
The royal brewers!
l've got plans for you! Company...

487
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:23,253
Lock up the prisoners!
One, two, three, four, five, six...

488
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:32,453
Make a run for it, you guys.
You can still swim... The crabs can't!

489
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:38,213
ls there any such thing
as a twister underwater?

490
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:51,659
Nobody's gonna mess with me.

491
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:57,330
You promised that
l was in charge of the army.

492
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:59,334
l'm in charge...

493
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:02,896
This may not be the best time
for this conversation...

494
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:06,256
l'll give the orders!
l'm the king! l'm the boss, ruller...

495
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:12,010
l'm callin' the shots! You might be
the one with the brains.

496
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,853
But l'm the one with the muscles!

497
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:22,412
- Oh no! The pump broke!
- We've got to fix it... fast!

498
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:35,536
ls it getting cold?

499
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:37,890
Uhmm... maybe.

500
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:46,013
We gotta get some more anti-dote...
How much more time left?

501
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:47,699
12 minutes till sundown.

502
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:49,015
We'll never make it.

503
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:53,373
What do you mean?
Tell me, tell me how we're gonna make it!

504
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:59,933
l can't. You were right.
There's not enough time.

505
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,339
Where you goin' Chuck?... CHUCK!

506
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:31,697
Blade intervals divided by the water
pressure and then multiply that by six...

507
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:39,975
Chuck? Chuck...?

508
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:52,411
- Twenty degrees, latitude north...
- What happened?

509
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,650
- ...pressure of velocity ratios...
- Where am l?

510
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:57,135
We're at the Professor's
water pump intake pipe!

511
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:00,656
ln the Professor's lab
there is a bottle of antifish Potion.

512
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:03,573
To get it we have to swim
through the pump system

513
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:06,174
the bottle is on the
professors work table

514
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:08,570
so we have to flood the lab in order ...

515
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:14,053
Whoa, wait... that pump'll chew us up...
and even if we make it in one piece,

516
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:16,570
we'd end up in the aquarium
with the piranha!

517
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,059
Hand me the screwdriver and thread.

518
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:20,449
What?! Did you hear what l just said?!

519
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:22,491
Down by your tail.
Screwdriver and thread.

520
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:30,139
No Stella! Wait!
You can't take Sasha with you!

521
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:32,929
Where we're going is too dangerous
for a little fish like her!

522
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:35,693
Sasha is my friend,
she's going to stay with me.

523
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:39,813
Oh, let her, keep her.
We'll never get out of here anyway.

524
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:43,210
Yes we will!...
Stella, say good-bye!

525
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:58,810
You have to go, Sasha.

526
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:16,138
No, Sasha. Go now.
l'll miss you, but you have to go.

527
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,416
No Sasha! STAY!

528
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,017
Goodbye, Sasha.

529
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:57,376
6 minutes left... you guys ready?

530
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:25,651
Charles! fish! Oh dear...
lt's all my fault! lf l hadn't fallen asleep...

531
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:41,896
Oh Lisa, can you ever forgive me?

532
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,933
That's enough, stop this.
lt's not your fault...

533
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:49,615
Bill and the Professor
will find them and then...

534
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:52,729
Hand over the fork-fish!

535
00:59:56,820 --> 01:00:00,574
five... four... three... two... one!

536
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:17,136
The balloon!

537
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:35,610
Chuck! Where are you going?!!

538
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,376
Three minutes left!

539
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:11,135
We got it!

540
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:18,049
l believe this dance is mine...

541
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:21,653
What was that?
l thought l heard Charles voice?

542
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:23,378
Anna. Stop, please.

543
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:25,332
Charles! Charles!

544
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:28,219
Fly, Stella! Where are you?

545
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:38,776
Stop!

546
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:43,371
l'm so sorry my dear friend,
but l can't stay for dinner.

547
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:58,891
Take that you sawtoothed suckers... !!!

548
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:15,013
You stupid, stupid fish.

549
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:17,574
Stupid fish...?

550
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,377
Fly! What are you doing?

551
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:25,177
l'm using my brain... for once!

552
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:33,532
Wait... wait!
Come back - You stupid fish!!!

553
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:38,730
l'm sufficiently intelligent to KlLL you
if you don't stop bothering me.

554
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:45,532
So what! Any brute could do that. But can
you tell me what's the square root of 6561?

555
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:50,970
300 divided by 40 minus 3 is eeh...

556
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:55,818
HA!!!! 81 !!!!

557
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:59,131
Yeah! But do you know what happens
if you travel with the speed of light?

558
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:05,931
You turn into pure energy.

559
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:08,131
What came first, the chicken or the egg?

560
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:16,019
lt depends on the relative amount
of molecules in the universe.

561
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:18,898
What happens to a fish
if it drinks too much anti-potion?

562
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:24,538
lt becomes human.

563
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:27,539
Can a human being breathe under water?

564
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:29,771
Of course not!

565
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:51,015
One minute!!!!!!

566
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:54,930
Fly...

567
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:05,492
Come on drink it quick.

568
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,289
Charles?

569
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:48,849
Mom!

570
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:55,849
Stella!
Oh my girl.

571
01:04:55,940 --> 01:05:00,218
They made it!
Ha ha, they all made it! Hurra...

572
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:02,129
Where's Fly?

573
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:25,614
Talk to me, Fly. Say something.
Don't do this to me...

574
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:33,855
Fly...

575
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:35,449
Oh no...

576
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:41,252
Fly! Don't give up! Okay... l'll find a way
to help you... there's got to be a way!

577
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:44,530
Do something!
Make a new potion!

578
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:48,972
l'm sorry... it's too late...
l warned him, but he didn't listen...

579
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:51,813
A time machine! You have
to have a time machine right?!

580
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:54,051
l mean turn back
the clock to before sunset!

581
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:55,579
l'm sorry, Chuck -

582
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:57,850
Charles... can't you see?

583
01:05:58,100 --> 01:05:58,737
No... !

584
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:00,215
lt's too late...

585
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:02,734
No... NO! lt's not too late!

586
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:06,777
lf we just substitute an acid
instead of an alkaline and... ohh...

587
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:10,573
Fly? Are you okay? Fly!

588
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:11,530
Charles...

589
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:13,258
No! Stay away from me!!!

590
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:16,818
Charles... here, let me...

591
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:17,889
No... !

592
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:30,576
No!!!! No... !

593
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:34,210
Hey! Could somebody
give me a hand in here!?

594
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:36,492
Over here!

595
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,174
Fly!!

596
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:51,733
Your alive... You're alive... !

597
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:59,049
Californian Flying fish!

598
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:22,649
Hey that was
some plan of yours, Chuck!

599
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:35,819
Cold drinks anyone?

600
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:37,219
Uhh... thanks... Anna.

601
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:38,210
Bill?

602
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:40,018
Oh that looks good, thanks.

603
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:44,014
Charles! Fly! Are you thirsty?

604
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:45,289
No thanks!

605
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:50,531
Can l erase some of these boring programs?
l need room to install Space Blaster.

606
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:54,852
Sure! Go ahead and dump Quantum Physics
for beginners. l never use it anyway.

607
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:56,658
Cool. Thanks!

608
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:02,015
Look out belo-o-o-w!!

609
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:17,170
You're a genius, Chuck!
The acceleration is much better now!

610
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:18,693
Let's add another tube!

611
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:21,735
Come on, Stella. Try the slide!

612
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:23,976
l don't feel like it...

613
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:35,778
Sasha! Sasha!

614
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:47,655
Look! lt's Sasha!
She came back to me! Mommy look, Daddy.

615
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:51,894
lt sould be possible...
lf we isolate a DNA strand...

616
