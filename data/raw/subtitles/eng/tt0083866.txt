255 million equivalent.

881
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:50,094
DOCTOR 2: Better do IV
and oral contrast.

882
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:53,473
If there's no response,
let's move to
hypertonic saline.

decreased tidal volume
on the boy.

891

support.

DOCTOR 4: PH is down to 7.03.
He's got metabolic acidosis.

900
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:40,937
It could be sepsis.

of blood cultures.

902

since I was 10 years old.

What can we do that
we're not already doing?

920
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:52,884
He needs to go home.

921
01:22:54,595 --> 01:22:56,721
He's calling his people

922
01:22:58,349 --> 01:23:00,975
and I don't know
where they are.

923
01:23:02,269 --> 01:23:04,312

that he was left
here intentionally.

925

But his being here
is a miracle, Elliott.

It's a miracle.
