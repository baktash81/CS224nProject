[pensive music playing]

2
00:00:44,286 --> 00:00:45,827
[boy] <i>When my father passed,</i>

3
00:00:47,744 --> 00:00:50,286
<i>I wanted nothing more
than my mother's happiness.</i>

4
00:00:55,411 --> 00:00:58,494
<i>For what kind of man would I be
if I did not help my mother?</i>

5
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,036
<i>If I did not save her?</i>

6
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:09,994
[mooing]

7
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:13,327

[door closes]

10
00:01:53,162 --> 00:01:54,245
You're not eating?

11
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:55,162
No.

12
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:01,037
[housekeeper sighs]

13
00:02:06,203 --> 00:02:07,203
[sighs]

14
00:02:11,495 --> 00:02:13,745
Have you figured it out yet, fatso?

15
00:02:14,953 --> 00:02:17,745
- [man] What?
- [plucking banjo]

16
00:02:17,828 --> 00:02:19,828
How many years
since we took over the ranch

17
00:02:19,912 --> 00:02:22,037
from the Old Gent and Old Lady?

18
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:24,745
Why?

19
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,370
Oh hell, think about it.

20
00:02:27,453 --> 00:02:30,370
[playing melody on banjo]

21
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:35,287
You ever try the house bath, Phil?

22
00:02:38,537 --> 00:02:39,453
No, I have not.

23
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:40,912
[sighs]

24
00:02:42,703 --> 00:02:45,453
[Phil] Early up tomorrow, brother.
Big old drive.

25
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,413
[cow mooing in distance]

26
00:02:51,496 --> 00:02:53,663
[pensive music playing]

27
00:02:53,746 --> 00:02:55,913
- [cows mooing]
- [cowhand whistles]

28
00:02:58,996 --> 00:03:00,996
[indistinct chatter]

29
00:03:20,121 --> 00:03:22,579
[Phil] There's a dead cow.
Keep our cattle away.

30
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:25,996
- [cowhand] What happened?
- [Phil] Anthrax. Don't touch.

31
00:03:30,163 --> 00:03:33,496
Well, guess this is it.

32
00:03:34,954 --> 00:03:35,871
What's "it," Phil?

33
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:41,663
What's "it"? All right, fatso,
I'll tell you what "it" is.

34
00:03:43,163 --> 00:03:45,663
Twenty-five years
since our first run together.

35
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:49,038
Nineteen hundred and nothing.

36
00:03:49,746 --> 00:03:51,329
That's a long time.

37
00:03:52,371 --> 00:03:53,621
Well, not too damn long.

38
00:04:02,996 --> 00:04:04,163
Know what we should do?

39
00:04:04,663 --> 00:04:06,079
What's that?

40
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:09,538
Go camping again in the mountains
and shoot ourselves some fresh elk liver.

41
00:04:10,204 --> 00:04:13,996
Cook it right there on the coals
like Bronco Henry taught us.

42
00:04:18,872 --> 00:04:19,997
You got a sore gut?

43
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:22,205
No.

44
00:04:22,705 --> 00:04:25,372
You act like it pains you
to hitch two words together.

45
00:04:28,955 --> 00:04:30,955
[cowhands shout indistinctly]

46
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:40,955

[doorbell jingles]

49
00:05:20,455 --> 00:05:21,997
There'll be 12 for tonight.

50
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,747
Do you what they'd prefer to eat?

51
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,580
They like the fried chicken dinner.

52
00:05:34,247 --> 00:05:36,247
[humming]

53
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,706
[boy] Yes?

54
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,206
I'm going to need your room.

55
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,290
[boy] All right.

56
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:42,956
[door opens]

57
00:05:47,498 --> 00:05:48,498
What are you doing?

58
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,206
Nothing.

59
00:05:54,248 --> 00:05:55,248
Is that an album?

60
00:05:56,998 --> 00:05:58,081
Not really.

61
00:05:58,165 --> 00:05:59,998
- [woman] May I?
- Sure.

62
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:01,331
[woman gasps]

63
00:06:03,456 --> 00:06:06,373
- [boy] Do you like the mansion?
- [woman] Too much to clean.

64
00:06:06,956 --> 00:06:10,456
You wouldn't have to clean it.
There would be cleaners.

65
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,373
[both chuckle]

66
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:14,998
Oh, she's beautiful.

67
00:06:16,665 --> 00:06:17,998
I like her flowers.

68
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,623
Oh! That's clever, Peter.

69
00:06:25,248 --> 00:06:26,998
They're so lovely.

70
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:28,123
Thanks.

71
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:31,290
[woman] For the tables?

72
00:06:32,373 --> 00:06:33,373
Sure.

73
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,956
- I need three chickens. Can you do them?
- All right.

74
00:06:40,373 --> 00:06:43,331
[sighs] You're gonna have
to move your stuff to the shed.

75
00:06:43,415 --> 00:06:45,415
I'll make a bed for you on the floor.

76
00:06:45,498 --> 00:06:47,498
[uneasy music playing]

77
00:07:14,124 --> 00:07:16,124
- [cows mooing]
- [cowhands whistling]

78
00:07:19,124 --> 00:07:21,707
[cowhands shouting indistinctly]

79
00:07:27,249 --> 00:07:29,249
[pensive music playing]

80
00:07:33,624 --> 00:07:35,624
[cowhands shouting indistinctly]

81
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:51,041
[dog barks]

82
00:07:51,124 --> 00:07:53,124
[indistinct chatter]

83
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:09,999
Jake.

84
00:08:10,082 --> 00:08:11,832
[men chattering indistinctly]

85
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,624
- [Phil] He there?
- Nope.

86
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,792
Well, we can't wait forever.
The cattle are in the yards, so drink up.

87
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,500
- You gonna say something?
- Nope.

88
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,125
Not without my brother.

89
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:42,083
[breathes deeply]

90
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:46,292
Where were you?

91
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,042
I couldn't make
the boys hold back forever.

92
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,417
That's fine.

93
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,208
Uh…

94
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:56,292
Checked the power, and it's held up.
Not coming till morning.

95
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:01,750
Oh, no, thanks. Phil, they're ready for us
next door at the Red Mill.

96
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,042
Dinnertime, boys.

97
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,208
[indistinct chatter]

98
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:05,667
[man] Let's get a move on.

99
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:13,125
Twenty-five years ago,
where were you, Georgie Boy?

100
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,375
Hmm?

101
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,875
- With you.
- I'll tell you.

102
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:21,208
A chubby know-nothing
too dumb to get through college.

103
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:23,708
People helped you, fatso.

104
00:09:23,792 --> 00:09:26,708
One person in particular
taught you and me ranching

105
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:28,542
so we damn well succeeded.

106
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,417
- Bronco Henry.
- Hmm.

107
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,542
[clears throat] So…

108
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:47,042
So, to us brothers, Romulus and Remus,
and the wolf who raised us.

109
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,875
- [cowhand 1] Bronco Henry.
- [cowhands] Bronco.

110
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,293
<i>- Il Lupo.</i>
- [George] Bronco.

111
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:52,751
- [cowhand 2] Bronco Henry.
- [cowhand 3] Bronco Henry.

112
00:09:53,751 --> 00:09:55,876
[glasses thudding on table]

113
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:57,001
[whistles]

114
00:09:57,084 --> 00:09:59,501
- [cowhand 4] Boss is leavin'.
- [cowhand 5] Dinner, boys.

115
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:09,751
[George] Much obliged.

116
00:10:09,834 --> 00:10:11,834
[indistinct chatter]

117
00:10:15,834 --> 00:10:18,876
Rose? Rose, play piano for us please.

118
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,126
[Rose] I can't!

119
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:22,834
- [diners] Play! Play! Play!
- [woman 1] Come on!

120
00:10:22,918 --> 00:10:24,918
[diners banging on table]

121
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,459
[diners groaning]

122
00:10:28,543 --> 00:10:30,876
- Is everything all right?
- [George] Yes, ma'am. Fine.

123
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,001
[man] I can play the piano.

124
00:10:32,084 --> 00:10:35,084
[diners laughing]

125
00:10:41,293 --> 00:10:43,293
[indistinct chatter]

126
00:10:47,751 --> 00:10:49,459
Well, well…

127
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:53,209
Ain't them purdy.

128
00:10:53,293 --> 00:10:55,293
[cowhands chuckle]

129
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:01,376
[diners laughing]

130
00:11:03,543 --> 00:11:06,251
[woman 2] "I've never seen a woman
behind the wheel of a car."

131
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:08,584
[indistinct chatter]

132
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:16,377
[diners laughing]

133
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,710
[woman 2] I said, "Have you never seen
a lady drive a car before?"

134
00:11:19,794 --> 00:11:20,794
[indistinct chatter]

135
00:11:20,877 --> 00:11:22,419
He thought the dog was driving.

136
00:11:22,502 --> 00:11:23,919
No. No.

137
00:11:24,002 --> 00:11:25,502
- No!
- [laughing]

138
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:26,919
Oh, yeah.

139
00:11:27,669 --> 00:11:28,627
Well…

140
00:11:29,794 --> 00:11:33,752
I wonder what little lady made these.

141
00:11:33,835 --> 00:11:35,294
[cowhands chuckle]

142
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,294
Actually, I did, sir.

143
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,919
My mother was a florist.

144
00:11:43,752 --> 00:11:46,252
So I made them
to look like the ones in our garden.

145
00:11:46,752 --> 00:11:48,335
Oh, well, do pardon me.

146
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:55,460
They're just as real as possible.

147
00:11:55,544 --> 00:11:57,210
[cowhands chuckle]

148
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,502
[sniffing] Mmm.

149
00:12:01,585 --> 00:12:02,544
[sniffing]

150
00:12:02,627 --> 00:12:06,252
All right. Now, gentlemen, look.
See, that's what you do with the cloth.

151
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:09,794
[cowhands gasping]

152
00:12:13,044 --> 00:12:15,919
- It's really just for wine drips.
- [Phil] Ooh, you got that, boys?

153
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,085
Only for the drips. [lisps]

154
00:12:19,169 --> 00:12:20,794
[all laughing]

155
00:12:24,127 --> 00:12:25,460
Now get us some food.

156
00:12:50,628 --> 00:12:53,836
- Did Bronco ever eat here?
- No, he did not.

157
00:12:54,586 --> 00:12:55,753
So where did you eat?

158
00:12:56,795 --> 00:13:01,170
Uh, back then we had herring at the saloon
and a whole lot of alcohol.

159
00:13:01,253 --> 00:13:02,128
[scoffs]

160
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,503
Oh.

161
00:13:03,586 --> 00:13:07,545
I remember this one time, Bronco made
this wager that he could jump any horse

162
00:13:07,628 --> 00:13:11,420
over the tables and chairs of the saloon
piled up in the street.

163
00:13:12,795 --> 00:13:15,836
Well, we chose him a nag all right.

164
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,670
[all chuckle]

165
00:13:17,753 --> 00:13:18,920
It didn't bother him.

166
00:13:20,253 --> 00:13:21,711
He took off his saddle,

167
00:13:22,878 --> 00:13:25,336
walked the horse
up to the tables and chairs,

168
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,920
talking to him all the while,

169
00:13:27,003 --> 00:13:30,211
stroking his big, ugly head
while the horse sniffed.

170
00:13:31,128 --> 00:13:32,211
[Phil clicks tongue]

171
00:13:32,961 --> 00:13:39,503
And then he swung on
and rode him back and… [exhales]

172
00:13:42,253 --> 00:13:43,253
[cowhand 1] What?

173
00:13:47,211 --> 00:13:48,045
Flew over.

174
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:49,753
- [all chuckling]
- [cowhand 2] He jumped it?

175
00:13:50,503 --> 00:13:52,545
- [cowhand 2 groans]
- [all laughing]

176
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,961
But to get a nag to jump… ain't heard of.

177
00:14:01,836 --> 00:14:03,879
Put it down to <i>amour.</i> [sighs]

178
00:14:06,921 --> 00:14:08,504
What do you say, George?

179
00:14:10,171 --> 00:14:11,171
<i>Amour?</i>

180

00:31:45,974 --> 00:31:47,433
We were married Sunday.

362
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,808
She got rid of her property in Beech.

363
00:32:00,891 --> 00:32:02,724
[uneasy music playing]

364
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,017
Quit it.

365
00:32:17,642 --> 00:32:18,517
[horse grunts]

366
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,434
Stand steady, you little bitch, huh?

367
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,559
- Come on.
- [horse snorts]

368
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:27,100
Look at me, you little bitch!
Huh? [grunts] Yeah?

369
00:32:28,267 --> 00:32:30,975
Quit it! You fat-faced bitch!

370
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:34,559
Whore!

371
00:32:34,642 --> 00:32:36,059
[horse whinnying]

372
00:32:41,725 --> 00:32:44,809
[woman] My school boarders eat dinner
at 6:00 p.m. sharp.

373
00:32:44,892 --> 00:32:47,392
No dish-washing duty if he has homework.

374
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:50,725
Oh. No shoes inside.

375
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:58,475
[Rose] Maybe you'd like to come
to the ranch sometimes?

376
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,809
Won't that be nice?

377
00:33:00,434 --> 00:33:02,642
[Peter] May I keep
some of these rose petals?

378
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,850
[George] Hey, ho.

379
00:33:16,934 --> 00:33:18,184
Take the rest for later.

380
00:33:23,184 --> 00:33:24,850
[sniffing]

381
00:33:36,184 --> 00:33:40,143
[George] I've been thinking
we should have some sort of dinner party

382
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,976
to introduce you to my parents.

383
00:33:44,476 --> 00:33:48,851
And perhaps we could invite
the governor and his wife too.

384
00:33:49,935 --> 00:33:52,726
I saw them in Herndon today, and, uh,

385
00:33:53,935 --> 00:33:56,476
I… I kind of already mentioned it to them.

386
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,810
[chuckles]

387
00:33:58,643 --> 00:34:03,851
Uh, maybe you'd be kind enough
to play something on our old piano.

388
00:34:05,768 --> 00:34:07,726
But, George, I'm not very good.

389
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,393
- I only played for the moving pictures.
- [chuckles]

390
00:34:12,268 --> 00:34:15,476
You are plenty fine enough for us.

391
00:34:17,768 --> 00:34:20,768
The Old Lady can't play a note,
so… [chuckles]

392
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,060
If that's what you want.

393
00:34:27,518 --> 00:34:28,976
This looks like a good spot.

394
00:34:29,476 --> 00:34:31,060
Pull over here, please.

395
00:34:31,143 --> 00:34:32,726
[George] A good spot for what?

396
00:34:41,768 --> 00:34:42,893
[Rose chuckles softly]

397
00:34:56,601 --> 00:34:58,310
You are marvelous, Rose.

398
00:35:01,018 --> 00:35:01,936
[chuckles softly]

399
00:35:09,561 --> 00:35:10,977
Stand beside me, George.

400
00:35:15,602 --> 00:35:17,269
[George] What's happening? [chuckles]

401
00:35:17,352 --> 00:35:18,519
[Rose] Follow me.

402
00:35:19,602 --> 00:35:20,602
Left foot forward.

403
00:35:21,394 --> 00:35:25,269
One, two, three. And to the side.

404
00:35:25,352 --> 00:35:28,519
One, two, three. And back.

405
00:35:28,602 --> 00:35:31,977
One, two, three.

406
00:35:33,227 --> 00:35:36,269
- To the side again. One, two…
- Sorry, I… I really can't.

407
00:35:38,394 --> 00:35:41,644
- I really can't dance. I… [chuckles]
- You're dancing. [chuckles]

408
00:35:42,852 --> 00:35:44,602
Here. This foot forward.

409
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,061
Don't think.

410
00:35:49,894 --> 00:35:52,186
One, two, three. To the side.

411
00:35:52,269 --> 00:35:54,602
One, two, three. And back.

412
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:56,936
One, two, three.

413
00:35:57,019 --> 00:35:58,852
I told you I'd teach you. [chuckles]

414
00:36:07,269 --> 00:36:09,894
Forward, two, three.

415
00:36:09,977 --> 00:36:11,311
Side, two…

416
00:36:11,394 --> 00:36:13,394
[humming]

417
00:36:21,602 --> 00:36:22,644
[breathes deeply]

418
00:36:27,562 --> 00:36:28,728
What is it, George?

419
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,812
I just… [sighs]

420
00:36:39,728 --> 00:36:41,812
I wanted to say how nice it is

421
00:36:43,478 --> 00:36:44,853
not to be alone.

422
00:36:52,937 --> 00:36:54,937
[somber music playing]

423
00:37:28,603 --> 00:37:29,645
[thunder rumbling]

424
00:37:30,687 --> 00:37:31,937
[engine idling]

425
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,645
[George] Go on up and get out of the cold.

426
00:37:33,728 --> 00:37:34,645
[car door closes]

427
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,520
[thunder rumbling]

428
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,813
[door closes]

429
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,229
Hello, Phil.

430
00:37:56,396 --> 00:37:57,854
You remember Rose?

431
00:37:58,813 --> 00:38:00,854
- Oh, hello there.
- Hello.

432
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:05,021
- Something wrong with the furnace?
- Search me.

433
00:38:08,104 --> 00:38:11,313
- I'll go down and shake it up.
- I've been hanging around for you all day.

434
00:38:11,396 --> 00:38:13,979
There's a deed
the Old Gent wants sent to him.

435
00:38:15,979 --> 00:38:18,021
Well, I figure that can go till morning.

436
00:38:18,854 --> 00:38:21,396
- You all right?
- I'm perfectly fine, George.

437
00:38:24,896 --> 00:38:26,271
[sighs]

438
00:38:30,021 --> 00:38:31,396
[muttering softly]

439
00:38:39,354 --> 00:38:40,813
Well, brother Phil,

440
00:38:42,729 --> 00:38:44,229
we had such a nice trip...

441
00:38:44,313 --> 00:38:45,521
I'm not your brother.

442
00:38:46,271 --> 00:38:47,813
You're a cheap schemer.

443
00:38:49,604 --> 00:38:51,604
[housekeeper humming]

444
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:01,604

445
00:39:07,396 --> 00:39:09,354
[mockingly] "We had such a nice trip."

[footsteps receding]

450
00:39:42,355 --> 00:39:43,564
[whispers] Come on in.

451
00:39:47,439 --> 00:39:51,439
This is the bathroom.
Just make yourself at home.

452
00:39:57,605 --> 00:39:58,564
Yeah, that's fine.

453
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,272
All right.

454
00:40:02,064 --> 00:40:02,897

[uneasy music playing]

468
00:43:31,733 --> 00:43:34,233
Now, you just make yourself comfortable.

469
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:39,608
Now, I'm going to bring you a surprise.

470
00:43:40,442 --> 00:43:41,358
What is it?

471
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:44,650
Well, then it won't be a surprise.

472
00:43:44,733 --> 00:43:45,858
[kisses]

473
00:44:03,983 --> 00:44:07,150
[housekeeper] When the rains come,
the cellar gets flooded.

474
00:44:07,233 --> 00:44:12,358
So, the rats all drown.
They float to the surface.

475
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:16,483
I have to get the young lads in
to scoop 'em all up with a…

476
00:44:27,192 --> 00:44:28,775
Please keep talking. [chuckles]

477
00:44:29,817 --> 00:44:30,817
Don't mind me.

478
00:44:31,983 --> 00:44:33,067
I like to keep busy.

479
00:44:39,567 --> 00:44:41,567
[dogs barking]

480
00:44:44,608 --> 00:44:46,608
[cowhands panting]

481
00:44:48,108 --> 00:44:49,108
[George] Easy.

482
00:44:50,651 --> 00:44:51,776
[cowhand 1] We got it.

483
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:53,234
[George] Head to the right.

484
00:44:53,734 --> 00:44:55,734
[indistinct chatter]

485
00:44:56,943 --> 00:44:59,901
- [George] Turn it around that way.
- [young housekeeper] Please, I'll take it.

486
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:04,151
- What is it?
- [George] Head to the front door.

487
00:45:04,651 --> 00:45:06,568
[Rose panting] George. Is that…

488
00:45:07,526 --> 00:45:09,026
Is that a grand?

489
00:45:09,109 --> 00:45:11,026
- [George] You got it?
- [cowhand 2] Yeah, I got it.

490
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:15,526
- [cowhand 3 grunting] Whoa, hold it.
- It's a Mason & Hamlin baby grand.

491
00:45:16,068 --> 00:45:18,443
Oh no, it's… it's too good for me. I'm…

492
00:45:19,026 --> 00:45:21,984
I'm just very average.
I… I only know tunes.

493
00:45:22,818 --> 00:45:24,401
That's what I want, tunes.

494
00:45:25,026 --> 00:45:26,318
The governor too.

495
00:45:27,151 --> 00:45:30,234
We don't want a concert.
We just wanna hear you play, Rose.

496
00:45:31,318 --> 00:45:34,318
- I should like to look on the governor…
- [George] Easy.

497
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:37,859

[cowhands grunting]

499
00:45:39,568 --> 00:45:42,401

[sighs]

518
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:12,404
- [cowhand] You make a rope with these?
- [Phil] These strips? Yeah.

519
00:49:27,987 --> 00:49:29,862
You boys find something needs doing.

520
00:49:30,821 --> 00:49:32,862
[cowhands] Yes, sir.

00:49:39,571 --> 00:49:41,571
[cowhands speaking indistinctly]

522
00:49:43,904 --> 00:49:46,946
I just came over to speak about something.

523
00:49:56,946 --> 00:49:59,071
Come on, partner.
Open your talker. What is it?

524
00:50:01,737 --> 00:50:02,821
[hesitates]

525
00:50:04,196 --> 00:50:10,196
His Nibs will be here for dinner
and the Old Gent and the Old Lady.

526
00:50:11,987 --> 00:50:14,112
Well, sir, ain't we going into society.

527
00:50:14,696 --> 00:50:16,487
[both chuckle]

528
00:50:19,237 --> 00:50:20,946
[Phil] She on the pinano again?

529
00:50:22,779 --> 00:50:24,196
Setting your teeth on edge?

530
00:50:26,947 --> 00:50:28,905
No. Uh…

531
00:50:29,863 --> 00:50:32,072
No, I… I like to hear Rose play.

532
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:35,280
Hmm.

533
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:41,988
Well, old-timer, what is it?

534
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:43,155
What's in the noodle?

535
00:50:45,822 --> 00:50:46,822
[George] Well…

536
00:50:48,238 --> 00:50:51,072
Phil. [hesitates] I, uh…

537
00:50:54,363 --> 00:50:56,738
- I just…
- Go on, spit it out.

538
00:50:56,822 --> 00:51:00,822
- Well, it's about His Nibs, the governor.
- [Phil] All right.

539
00:51:01,447 --> 00:51:02,405
And, uh…

540
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:06,447
Well, it's not so much about His Nibs

541
00:51:07,738 --> 00:51:11,905
but His Nibs' wife, actually, uh…

542
00:51:13,947 --> 00:51:18,488
I was thinking His Nibs
probably wouldn't mind so much,

543
00:51:20,322 --> 00:51:22,780
but his missus might.

544
00:51:23,363 --> 00:51:24,863
What, for dear Christ's sake?

545
00:51:26,113 --> 00:51:29,322
Well, it's sort of a hard thing…
[exhales sharply]

546
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:32,030
…to say.

547
00:51:32,113 --> 00:51:33,197
Uh…

548
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,488
She might mind if you come
to the table without a washup.

549
00:51:46,447 --> 00:51:47,447
Yeah.

550
00:51:48,613 --> 00:51:50,614
[pensive music playing]

551
00:52:08,489 --> 00:52:10,656
[George] Hello, Mother, Father.

552
00:52:10,739 --> 00:52:11,698
[Old Gent] Hello.

553
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:17,031
The car's around the side.

554
00:52:17,114 --> 00:52:18,364
Is there anyone with you?

555
00:52:19,614 --> 00:52:20,698
My wife.

556
00:52:28,406 --> 00:52:33,489
The napkin is fanned, so…

557
00:52:34,281 --> 00:52:35,489
[whistles]

558
00:52:36,781 --> 00:52:38,323
Light the fire.

559
00:52:38,406 --> 00:52:39,781
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

560
00:52:39,864 --> 00:52:41,823
We may as well try and warm this place.

561
00:52:43,573 --> 00:52:45,364
Water, white wine…

562
00:52:47,906 --> 00:52:50,739
Use your hand. Use your hand like so.

563
00:52:52,031 --> 00:52:53,323
[young housekeeper] They're here.

564
00:53:04,073 --> 00:53:06,656
You keep warm. I can bring them in.

565
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,990
[indistinct chatter, cheering]

566
00:53:32,115 --> 00:53:35,449
[woman chuckling] Oh, how sweet.
They have their own umbrella.

567
00:53:35,532 --> 00:53:38,865
- [George] Orange blossoms.
- It's an island of civilization here.

568
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:39,782
[woman] Mmm.

569
00:53:39,865 --> 00:53:43,324
I was, uh, telling Georgie
about your brother.

570
00:53:43,407 --> 00:53:45,574
Phi Beta Kappa at Yale, wasn't it?

571
00:53:45,657 --> 00:53:47,990
Yes, in classics.

572
00:53:48,907 --> 00:53:49,907
That's right.

573
00:53:50,657 --> 00:53:54,907
So, uh… he swears at the cattle
in Greek or Latin?

574
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:57,407
[woman and George chuckle]

575
00:54:01,782 --> 00:54:02,782
Yeah.

576
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:09,574
Uh, Rose plays the piano very well.

577
00:54:10,157 --> 00:54:11,157
Do you?

578
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:13,365
That's a nice surprise.

579
00:54:17,157 --> 00:54:18,157
[chuckles]

580
00:54:22,865 --> 00:54:26,157
I'll just go have a look-see
out the back for Phil.

581
00:54:26,824 --> 00:54:28,740
Oh, good. I want to meet this brother.

582
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:30,740
[George] Yes.

583
00:54:32,199 --> 00:54:34,699
[woman] I suppose
there was some sort of an injury.

584
00:54:34,782 --> 00:54:36,490
[Old Lady laughing] Oh, Edward, Georgina.

585
00:54:36,574 --> 00:54:39,283
Ah! Here are two people we can't fool.

586
00:54:39,366 --> 00:54:43,033
Oh no, you cannot. We know everything.
We're walking encyclopedias.

587
00:54:43,116 --> 00:54:45,325
At least I am.
I have nothing to do but read.

588
00:54:45,408 --> 00:54:48,408
[Old Gent] She's been reading
"The Curse of Tutankhamun" in <i>The Digest.</i>

589
00:54:48,491 --> 00:54:50,741
So, uh, you believe in the curse?

590
00:54:50,825 --> 00:54:53,866
Oh, no, no, I'm not drinking
George's concoction.

591
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:57,783
Yes, I do. But did you know
that Tutankhamun was just a boy?

592
00:54:57,866 --> 00:54:58,741
Only 18.

593
00:55:10,991 --> 00:55:12,408
[George] Phil, are you here?

594
00:55:22,033 --> 00:55:23,200
I was looking for you.

595
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:27,908
Well, you found me.

596
00:55:29,783 --> 00:55:32,408
Everyone's here.
And we're just about to eat.

597
00:55:33,783 --> 00:55:35,575
They're asking after you.

598
00:55:37,491 --> 00:55:38,450
Really?

599
00:55:39,366 --> 00:55:42,158
Yes, we're counting on your conversation.

600
00:55:48,075 --> 00:55:51,200
I shouldn't have said
what I said to you about...

601
00:55:51,283 --> 00:55:54,616
You two can keep your apologies
to yourself. I'm not coming.

602
00:55:56,616 --> 00:55:58,200
And what will I say?

603
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:02,909
The Old Lady wants to see you too.
She's come a long way.

604
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:04,409
You can tell them the truth.

605
00:56:05,367 --> 00:56:08,534
That I stink and I like it.

606
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:13,451
[Old Lady] Nothing could have happened
to Phil, could it?

607
00:56:13,534 --> 00:56:17,409
[George] No, he'll be fine.
Something just must've come up.

608
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:21,242
[Georgina] So, Rose…

609
00:56:23,617 --> 00:56:25,076
Are you going to play for us?

610
00:56:25,159 --> 00:56:27,659
[Old Lady] Yes, George told me
you play very well.

611
00:56:27,742 --> 00:56:30,534
- Oh no, I'm terribly out of practice.
- [Edward] Yes, we'd love that.

612
00:56:31,242 --> 00:56:33,951
Come now, you've been playing a lot.

613
00:56:34,034 --> 00:56:35,117
You know you have.

614
00:56:36,201 --> 00:56:37,909
I don't know what to play.

615
00:56:38,492 --> 00:56:39,784
[George] Why,

616
00:56:39,867 --> 00:56:41,034
play the one I like.

617
00:56:43,076 --> 00:56:47,034
- What one?
- Why, the… the one about the Gypsy.

618
00:56:47,117 --> 00:56:49,159
I… I can't seem to remember that one.

619
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:55,867
Just play anything. [chuckles]

620
00:56:57,701 --> 00:56:58,909
[sighs]

621
00:57:28,702 --> 00:57:29,535
[clears throat]

622
00:57:41,743 --> 00:57:42,910
[Rose sighs]

623
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:45,035
[playing discordantly]

624
00:57:47,035 --> 00:57:48,285
I'm so sorry.

625
00:57:49,743 --> 00:57:51,618
I can't seem to play. [chuckles]

626
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:56,535
I… I played in a cinema pit
for hours and hours.

627
00:57:56,618 --> 00:57:59,202
I'm… I'm so sorry.

628
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:03,743
Well, she got you halter trained,
right, George? That's the main thing.

629
00:58:03,827 --> 00:58:05,452
- [laughing]
- [Rose] I'm so sorry.

630
00:58:05,535 --> 00:58:08,118
No, it was a lovely, lovely evening.

631
00:58:08,202 --> 00:58:09,035
Thank you.

632
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:11,535
[Phil whistling melodically]

633
00:58:19,327 --> 00:58:21,243
Oh, you're Phil.

634
00:58:22,452 --> 00:58:24,243
So, you weren't eaten by a cougar.

635
00:58:25,577 --> 00:58:26,493
[Phil] Not yet.

636
00:58:26,993 --> 00:58:29,160
I am sorry
to have missed your conversation.

637
00:58:29,243 --> 00:58:30,660
I've heard you're brilliant.

638
00:58:30,743 --> 00:58:33,910
You're gonna want to keep your distance.
I'm just off the horse.

639
00:58:35,077 --> 00:58:36,660
Anyhows, you don't want conversation.

640
00:58:36,743 --> 00:58:39,618
You've been listening to the pinano
and dancing, I guess.

641
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:43,743
You dance?

642
00:58:49,535 --> 00:58:51,411
You didn't play?

643
00:58:52,869 --> 00:58:54,828
You sure did practice a terrible lot.

644
00:58:57,203 --> 00:58:59,328
See, you wouldn't think
there was much difference

645
00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:01,786
between a cinema pit and a dinner party.

646
00:59:01,869 --> 00:59:03,369
[Old Lady] Where have you been, Phil?

647
00:59:04,828 --> 00:59:06,744
I could hardly eat worrying about you.

648
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:10,494
I didn't get washed up, so I didn't come.

649
00:59:10,578 --> 00:59:12,119
[Old Lady chuckles] You didn't wash?

650
00:59:15,036 --> 00:59:18,786
Oh, he's a ranchman, isn't that right?
That's honest dirt.

651
00:59:21,828 --> 00:59:23,286
- Thank you, again.
- Thank you.

652
00:59:23,369 --> 00:59:25,119
[indistinct chatter]

653
00:59:34,369 --> 00:59:37,328
[George] I'll just run and grab you
a blanket for the ride.

654
00:59:37,411 --> 00:59:39,286
[whistling melodically]

655
00:59:51,286 --> 00:59:53,078
[continues whistling]

656
00:59:54,869 --> 00:59:56,328
[George] All right, goodbye.

657
00:59:57,619 --> 00:59:59,619
[uneasy music playing]

658
01:00:32,787 --> 01:00:34,620
[Rose] I wondered
if you didn't think about

659
01:00:34,704 --> 01:00:37,037
leaving your medical books here
for the summer.

660
01:00:38,162 --> 01:00:42,579
I thought about it, but…
but you understand they were Dad's.

661
01:00:43,329 --> 01:00:44,329
Turn around.

662
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:48,412
Are you eating?

663
01:00:51,787 --> 01:00:52,787
I made a new friend.

664
01:00:53,704 --> 01:00:55,495
He calls me Doctor,
and I call him Professor,

665
01:00:55,579 --> 01:00:57,370
'cause that's what we wanna be.

666
01:00:58,662 --> 01:01:00,912
Why don't you invite your friend
to the ranch?

667
01:01:00,995 --> 01:01:02,162
[scoffs] No, Rose.

668
01:01:03,412 --> 01:01:04,329
Why not?

669
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:06,829
Thank you.

670
01:01:06,912 --> 01:01:09,037
I don't want him to meet a certain person.

671
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:12,079
[dramatic music playing]

672
01:01:13,787 --> 01:01:15,162
[cowhand 1] A bull calf, boss!

673
01:01:15,245 --> 01:01:17,870
[cowhand 2] Keep that leg stretched out!
You got him?

674
01:01:19,704 --> 01:01:21,037
[cowhand 3] Grab his head!

675
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:22,995
[cowhand 4] I got it! I got it!

676
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:24,370
[cows bleating]

677
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:34,954
[cowhand 5] How come
you don't wear gloves?

678
01:01:35,454 --> 01:01:37,245
[Phil] How 'bout
'cause they're not needed.

679
01:01:43,788 --> 01:01:46,663
Castrate 1,500 head,
then nick your thumb on the last.

680
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:49,538
[sighs]

681
01:01:50,163 --> 01:01:53,080
Well, fatso, I think we're finished.

682
01:02:01,621 --> 01:02:02,621
Who's that?

683
01:02:05,163 --> 01:02:06,538
Miss Nancy.

684
01:02:07,663 --> 01:02:08,913
Our waiter?

685
01:02:08,996 --> 01:02:10,788
Yep, that's him.

686
01:02:12,413 --> 01:02:15,455
You're gonna see him
creeping all over the place now.

687
01:02:15,538 --> 01:02:17,330
Big eyes goggling.

688
01:02:22,163 --> 01:02:24,330
Little Lord Fauntleroy.

689
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:26,663
[Rose speaking indistinctly]

690
01:02:36,163 --> 01:02:37,163
[sighs]

691
01:02:41,371 --> 01:02:42,496
[George] Rose?

692
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:43,413
[sighs]

693
01:02:44,538 --> 01:02:45,996
[George] Does he like his room?

694
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:47,413
[Rose] Mm-hmm.

695
01:02:48,705 --> 01:02:49,621
I think so.

696
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:53,496
[Phil] Watch your fires. Summer's coming.

697
01:02:54,621 --> 01:02:58,205
Which also means any Indians camping
need to be moved off the property.

698
01:02:58,288 --> 01:02:59,455
No exceptions.

699
01:03:00,121 --> 01:03:03,247
- We got animals they want to eat. Got it?
- [dog barking]

700
01:03:03,331 --> 01:03:04,831
[cowhands] Yes, sir.

701
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:06,331
We don't sell hides.

702
01:03:07,622 --> 01:03:09,372
We don't sell anything here.

703
01:03:10,497 --> 01:03:11,497
[whistles]

704
01:03:28,081 --> 01:03:29,456
[cowhands laughing]

705
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:31,581
Keep your eyes and ears open.

706
01:03:31,664 --> 01:03:34,456
Maybe find yourselves
an arrowhead up by them aspens.

707
01:03:34,539 --> 01:03:35,956
[cowhands laughing]

708
01:03:39,247 --> 01:03:40,706
[uneasy music playing]

709
01:03:58,164 --> 01:03:59,289
[objects clattering]

710
01:04:17,497 --> 01:04:18,497
Rose?

711
01:04:20,956 --> 01:04:22,372
I have a headache.

712
01:04:28,207 --> 01:04:29,207
Have a seat.

713
01:04:34,373 --> 01:04:36,123
I'm not eating tonight.

714
01:04:36,207 --> 01:04:41,623
It's George's week in town,
so it's just Phil.

715
01:04:42,915 --> 01:04:44,082
[Peter] Mm-hmm.

716
01:04:46,332 --> 01:04:47,915
I made a trap.

717
01:04:47,998 --> 01:04:50,748
Oh no. It's… it's not a snake, is it?

718
01:04:52,248 --> 01:04:53,957
[Rose chuckles sweetly]

719
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:56,415
It's a bunny.

720
01:04:57,082 --> 01:04:58,790
Oh. Oh! [shushing]

721
01:04:58,873 --> 01:05:00,915
You're okay. [kissing]

722
01:05:00,998 --> 01:05:02,332
[chuckles, kisses]

723
01:05:03,998 --> 01:05:05,748
[laughs, exclaims]

724
01:05:06,332 --> 01:05:08,207
No, no, it's scared.

725
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:09,748
- [Peter] Come here.
- Get it, Peter.

726
01:05:09,832 --> 01:05:12,207
[Peter] Come here. Come here. Come here.

727
01:05:14,207 --> 01:05:15,165
Bring him to me.

728
01:05:16,665 --> 01:05:17,623
Aw.

729
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:20,582
[Rose murmuring indistinctly]

730
01:05:21,873 --> 01:05:22,832
[door opens]

731
01:05:22,915 --> 01:05:25,082
[footsteps approaching]

732
01:05:31,748 --> 01:05:33,165
Don't worry about him.

733
01:05:35,207 --> 01:05:36,623
You can eat in your room.

734
01:05:38,457 --> 01:05:42,290
[housekeeper] They dug up that graveyard
to make way for the new highway.

735
01:05:43,373 --> 01:05:46,207
Among those buried there
was a friend of mine.

736
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:50,958
A clumsy tractor driver
broke open the coffin,

737
01:05:51,499 --> 01:05:56,666
and they found her hair
had continued to grow after her death.

738
01:05:58,333 --> 01:06:03,458
The whole coffin just stuffed
with her lovely golden hair.

739
01:06:04,583 --> 01:06:06,708
Except for a few feet from the end,

740
01:06:08,249 --> 01:06:09,499
where it was gray.

741
01:06:13,708 --> 01:06:14,958
Can I take it up?

742
01:06:15,041 --> 01:06:17,041
- [housekeeper] Some say she was a beauty.
- What?

743
01:06:17,124 --> 01:06:19,333
[housekeeper] Golden braids
on top of her hair.

744
01:06:19,416 --> 01:06:21,958
Oh! Yes, go and see. It's very sweet.

745
01:06:27,874 --> 01:06:29,374
- [knock on door]
- [door opens]

746
01:06:29,458 --> 01:06:32,166
- No, please. Get out of my room.
- Where's your rabbit?

747
01:06:33,958 --> 01:06:35,749
[young housekeeper squeaking]

748
01:06:37,166 --> 01:06:38,291
I got it a carrot.

749
01:06:39,083 --> 01:06:40,166
It doesn't want one.

750
01:06:41,291 --> 01:06:42,291
Why?

751
01:06:42,374 --> 01:06:43,458
[squeaking]

752
01:06:45,708 --> 01:06:46,791
[gasps]

753
01:06:47,708 --> 01:06:48,791
Holy hell.

754
01:06:57,499 --> 01:06:59,041
[clicks tongue] Shut the door.

755
01:07:00,249 --> 01:07:01,291
[door closes]

756
01:07:04,041 --> 01:07:04,874
[sighs]

757
01:07:11,791 --> 01:07:14,459
Now, even if you're happy
being in your room all day,

758
01:07:14,959 --> 01:07:15,875
it's good for me.

759
01:07:16,667 --> 01:07:18,459
- Mom, I have a lot to do.
- Come on.

760
01:07:19,792 --> 01:07:20,792
Peter…

761
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:24,167
I thought you liked rabbits.

762
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:27,875
Yes. I do.

763
01:07:29,667 --> 01:07:32,125
But if I want to be a surgeon,
I have to practice.

764
01:07:33,292 --> 01:07:34,417
[scoffs]

765
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:37,500
Well, you're not to kill them
in the house, Peter.

766
01:07:38,334 --> 01:07:39,959
No, I'm putting my foot down.

767
01:07:42,292 --> 01:07:44,834
Oh, where'd a man be
if he always did what his mother told him?

768
01:07:44,917 --> 01:07:45,917
I'll score.

769
01:07:50,792 --> 01:07:51,834
[Peter] Whoa!

770
01:07:52,417 --> 01:07:53,667
Point to Mrs. Burbank.

771
01:07:55,292 --> 01:07:56,542
I know, Lola. You don't have to…

772
01:07:57,834 --> 01:08:00,875
You don't have to narrate it.
I'll just… remember.

773
01:08:06,917 --> 01:08:09,709
- Whoo!
- [Lola] Yeah, that was definitely out.

774
01:08:09,792 --> 01:08:11,792
[indistinct chatter]

775
01:08:15,959 --> 01:08:16,959

01:08:22,125 --> 01:08:23,334
[sighs]

777
01:08:24,875 --> 01:08:28,167
Lola, can you please take over?
I have a migraine.

778
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
[Lola] Yeah.

779
01:08:30,959 --> 01:08:32,750
- [cowhand 1] Where do you want me?
- Back there.

780
01:08:32,834 --> 01:08:33,750
[cowhand 1] Yes, ma'am.

781
01:08:33,834 --> 01:08:35,334
- I hit that way.
- I was aiming for you.

782
01:08:35,417 --> 01:08:36,750
[cowhand 2] Don't listen to Bobby.

783
01:08:36,834 --> 01:08:38,168
[Peter] Are you all right, Mother?

784
01:08:38,251 --> 01:08:41,293
[Rose sniffles] I feel like my eyes
are going to pop out of my head.

785
01:08:41,376 --> 01:08:42,960
[breathing heavily]

786
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:52,418
It's Phil, isn't it?

787
01:08:55,043 --> 01:08:55,960
He's cold.

788
01:08:56,043 --> 01:08:59,001
He's just a man, Peter, only another man.

789
01:09:00,793 --> 01:09:01,793
You go ahead.

790
01:09:05,668 --> 01:09:06,710
[groans]

791
01:09:08,835 --> 01:09:10,168

01:10:23,336 --> 01:10:25,961

[cheering]

802
01:10:43,502 --> 01:10:45,627
Yeah? You want 'em off, do you?

803
01:10:45,711 --> 01:10:47,377
- [laughing]
- You want 'em off?

804
01:10:48,586 --> 01:10:49,419
Yeah, come on.

805
01:10:49,502 --> 01:10:51,127
Yeah, you want 'em?

806
01:10:51,211 --> 01:10:52,961
Yeah, you got 'em!

Get out of here, you little bitch!

814

You hear me?

[Peter grunts]

816
01:16:24,090 --> 01:16:25,840

[Phil] Pete.

841
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:39,342
Hey, Pete.

842
01:18:41,592 --> 01:18:42,508
Peter.

843
01:18:47,883 --> 01:18:49,383
[Peter] You want me, Mr. Burbank?

844
01:18:52,467 --> 01:18:54,717
[Phil] Well, I don't see
any Mr. Burbank here.

845
01:18:56,133 --> 01:18:57,383
I'm Phil.

846
01:18:58,217 --> 01:18:59,258
Yes, Mr. Burbank.

847
01:18:59,342 --> 01:19:02,508
I guess it's hard for a young'un like you
to call an old fella like me

848
01:19:02,592 --> 01:19:05,633
just plain Phil, at first.

849
01:19:07,842 --> 01:19:09,508
Now come and take a look at this.

850
01:19:11,467 --> 01:19:14,800
Have you done any braiding
or plaiting yourself, Pete?

851
01:19:17,133 --> 01:19:19,633
No, I never have, sir.

852
01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:28,717
Peter, we kind of got off
on the wrong foot.

853
01:19:30,342 --> 01:19:32,800
- Did we, sir?
- [Phil] Forget the "sir" stuff.

854
01:19:33,967 --> 01:19:35,717
That can happen to people.

855
01:19:37,342 --> 01:19:39,717
People who get to be good friends.

856
01:19:41,467 --> 01:19:43,342
Well, you know what?

857
01:19:43,425 --> 01:19:45,300
What? What, Phil?

858
01:19:48,342 --> 01:19:50,634
Now, you see? You did it.

859
01:19:51,634 --> 01:19:52,759
You called me Phil.

860
01:19:54,759 --> 01:19:58,718
I'm gonna finish this rope and give it
to you and teach you how to use it.

861
01:19:59,593 --> 01:20:02,968
Sort of a lonesome place out here, Pete.

862
01:20:03,884 --> 01:20:05,801
Unless you get in the swing of things.

863
01:20:06,759 --> 01:20:08,926
Thank you… Phil.

864
01:20:11,426 --> 01:20:14,009
How long do you expect it would take
to finish that rope?

865
01:20:14,093 --> 01:20:16,843
I could get it finished
before you go back to school.

866

[chuckles]

867
01:20:20,468 --> 01:20:21,634
[Peter] Well…

868
01:20:23,259 --> 01:20:24,926
It won't be very long then, Phil.

[Phil] Get on it.

874
01:21:34,177 --> 01:21:35,469
You can sit on it, Pete.

875
01:21:39,469 --> 01:21:40,719
Get yourself used to it.

876
01:21:43,719 --> 01:21:44,927
You got any boots?

877
01:21:46,135 --> 01:21:48,177
- [Peter] Yes.
- You should wear 'em.

878
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:52,844
Don't let your mom make a sissy of you.

879
01:22:03,635 --> 01:22:05,010
[Peter] That's impressive, Phil.

880
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:08,635
Well, just by sitting there,

881
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:12,344
you're soaking up all the riding know-how
you'll ever need and then some.

882
01:22:13,135 --> 01:22:15,177
That saddle belonged to Bronco Henry.

883
01:22:16,885 --> 01:22:18,344
Greatest rider I ever knew.

884
01:22:26,177 --> 01:22:32,552
There's a cliff way out back of the ranch
with initials and 1805 carved into it.

885
01:22:32,635 --> 01:22:35,719
Must have been some fella
from the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

886
01:22:38,303 --> 01:22:40,220
They were real men in those days.

887
01:22:43,011 --> 01:22:45,803
Let's say just you and me
go out for a couple of days.

888
01:22:45,886 --> 01:22:48,178
Find those trails
and follow them to the end.

889
01:22:50,886 --> 01:22:54,011
Wouldn't be surprised if there were gold

01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:57,470
or precious minerals in them there rocks.

891
01:23:01,386 --> 01:23:03,761
[Peter] Do many of the calves
die from wolves?

892
01:23:06,803 --> 01:23:12,886
There's always a few that get…
tore up or hamstrung or die of anthrax.

893
01:23:12,970 --> 01:23:13,845
Call it blackleg.

894
01:23:13,928 --> 01:23:17,095
You know, you talk like a Victrola record.
You know that?

895
01:23:17,178 --> 01:23:19,845
No, I didn't know.

896
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:21,761
Yeah, well, you do.

897
01:23:31,178 --> 01:23:34,178
- Did Bronco Henry teach you to ride, Phil?
- [Phil] Yep.

898
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:41,011
He taught me to use my eyes
in ways that other people can't.

899
01:23:43,970 --> 01:23:45,470
Take that hill over there.

900
01:23:51,511 --> 01:23:53,636
Most people look at it
and just see a hill.

901
01:23:54,845 --> 01:23:57,511
Where Bronco looked at it,
what do you suppose he saw?

902
01:24:01,846 --> 01:24:02,846
A barking dog.

903
01:24:04,637 --> 01:24:07,637
- The hell, you just saw that now?
- No.

904
01:24:08,887 --> 01:24:10,137
When I first came here.

905
01:24:10,929 --> 01:24:14,929
See, it looks like a dog
with its jaw wide open.

906
01:24:17,804 --> 01:24:19,304
You… you just saw that?

907
01:24:20,762 --> 01:24:21,596
Yeah.

908
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:23,262
[running thumb over comb]

909
01:24:25,971 --> 01:24:27,637
- [door opens]
- [Rose] Peter.

910
01:24:27,721 --> 01:24:29,387
[uneasy music playing]

911
01:24:29,471 --> 01:24:30,471
Peter.

912
01:24:32,887 --> 01:24:34,929
Can't you come in and talk for a little?

913
01:24:46,471 --> 01:24:50,887
You've gotten to be quite friendly
with Phil, haven't you?

914
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:57,096
Is he nice to you?

915
01:24:57,179 --> 01:24:58,304
[running thumb over comb]

916
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:01,012
He's making a rope for me.

917
01:25:02,762 --> 01:25:03,846
Making a rope?

918
01:25:06,637 --> 01:25:09,346
Peter, I wish you wouldn't make that sound
with your comb.

919
01:25:12,887 --> 01:25:13,971
I wasn't aware.

920
01:25:14,054 --> 01:25:15,804
[Rose] When I was little, I…

921
01:25:15,887 --> 01:25:20,096
I felt a chill in my spine when I heard
the chalk squeak on a blackboard.

922
01:25:22,471 --> 01:25:25,680
Oh, Miss… [chuckling]
Mrs. Merchant, that's who it was.

923
01:25:27,013 --> 01:25:31,847
She… she drew chalk stars
by our names on the blackboard.

924
01:25:34,222 --> 01:25:36,388
I wonder why it was stars she gave us.

925
01:25:37,888 --> 01:25:41,555
Why not diamonds? Why not hearts?

926
01:25:42,597 --> 01:25:45,180
Why not spades? [laughs] Why…

927
01:25:49,347 --> 01:25:52,847
I wonder why it was always stars.

928
01:25:54,388 --> 01:25:56,680
Because stars are supposed
to be unreachable.

929
01:25:58,680 --> 01:25:59,763
[chuckles softly]

930
01:25:59,847 --> 01:26:00,847
Yes.

931
01:26:01,888 --> 01:26:05,138
But they weren't unreachable
because she gave them to us.

932
01:26:09,555 --> 01:26:11,263
- And, Peter?
- [Peter] Hmm?

933
01:26:11,347 --> 01:26:16,013
We had this valentine box,
and it was covered with white crepe paper.

934
01:26:17,888 --> 01:26:20,597
And we would paste big, red hearts on it.

935
01:26:22,055 --> 01:26:23,888
Lopsided hearts. [chuckles]

936
01:26:23,972 --> 01:26:25,805
And you had a great many valentines.

937
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:31,138
A great many?

938
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:33,972
[sighs]

939
01:26:35,305 --> 01:26:36,597
Because you're beautiful.

940
01:26:47,638 --> 01:26:49,931
Is there a sound that makes you shiver?

941
01:26:53,806 --> 01:26:55,514
[running thumb over comb]

942
01:26:59,223 --> 01:27:00,431
I don't remember.

943
01:27:03,806 --> 01:27:05,306
We're not unreachable.

944
01:27:10,306 --> 01:27:11,389
[Peter whispers] Hey.

945
01:27:12,806 --> 01:27:16,223
No, we're not unreachable.

946
01:27:16,306 --> 01:27:18,723
Mother, you don't have to do this.

947
01:27:20,139 --> 01:27:22,681
I'll see you don't have to do it.

948
01:27:32,306 --> 01:27:33,556
[running thumb over comb]

949
01:27:33,639 --> 01:27:34,973
[cowhands laughing]

950
01:27:35,056 --> 01:27:36,556
[indistinct chatter]

951
01:27:39,764 --> 01:27:41,806
- [Phil] This his first week?
- [cowhand 1] Nope, third.

952
01:27:41,889 --> 01:27:42,848
[Phil] Third?

953
01:27:44,139 --> 01:27:45,681
Open up the gate. Let him out.

954
01:27:45,764 --> 01:27:47,806
- You sure? He's not ready.
- Go on. Let him out.

955
01:27:48,681 --> 01:27:50,681
[cowhands laughing]

956
01:27:53,514 --> 01:27:54,556
[Phil grunts]

957
01:27:55,514 --> 01:27:58,264
- [cowhand 2] Yeehaw, cowboy! Whoo!
- [all laughing]

958
01:27:58,348 --> 01:27:59,306
There you go!

959
01:28:00,473 --> 01:28:02,181
[cowhand 3] Grab her by the reins!

960
01:28:03,348 --> 01:28:05,264
- [Phil] What you doing?
- Going to give him a hand.

961
01:28:05,348 --> 01:28:06,348
Don't.

962
01:28:07,473 --> 01:28:09,764
- Let him figure it out.
- [cowhand 4] Oh, oh!

963
01:28:09,848 --> 01:28:10,848
[Phil] Or not.

964
01:28:10,931 --> 01:28:12,223
[cowhands laughing]

965
01:28:13,306 --> 01:28:15,307
Fall off, you get back on.

966
01:28:16,765 --> 01:28:18,015
[cowhand 5] Get her over!

967
01:28:18,099 --> 01:28:19,932
[all laughing]

968
01:28:23,099 --> 01:28:25,099
[uneasy music playing]

969
01:29:06,057 --> 01:29:06,890
[grunting]

970
01:29:06,974 --> 01:29:08,140
[shuddering]

971
01:29:10,307 --> 01:29:11,307
[yelps]

972
01:29:14,515 --> 01:29:16,057
[yelps and shudders]

973
01:29:33,765 --> 01:29:35,140
[flies buzzing]

974
01:30:16,058 --> 01:30:17,558
[flesh cutting]

975
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:30,600
- [dog barks]
- [horse whinnies]

976
01:30:30,683 --> 01:30:33,100
[George in distance]
Any happenings while I was away?

977
01:30:33,183 --> 01:30:34,725
[Phil] Boys dug the ditch.

978
01:30:35,891 --> 01:30:37,391
Water's flowing good.

979
01:30:37,975 --> 01:30:39,516
Fixing that stack there.

980
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:41,808
[whistles] Hey, Pete!

981
01:30:41,891 --> 01:30:43,266
[whistles] Come here.

982
01:30:46,808 --> 01:30:48,516
Peter? Peter?

983
01:30:50,891 --> 01:30:52,600
[George] Where are you two off to?

984
01:30:53,683 --> 01:30:56,891
[Phil] We're going to the far field
to fence off the stack there.

985
01:30:56,975 --> 01:30:58,475
[Rose breathing heavily]

986
01:30:58,558 --> 01:30:59,558
Peter?

987
01:31:01,309 --> 01:31:02,684
- Rose?
- Peter!

988
01:31:02,767 --> 01:31:04,184
[panting]

989
01:31:05,142 --> 01:31:06,434
Rose, what's the matter?

990
01:31:06,517 --> 01:31:09,267
[grunts, panting]

991
01:31:11,476 --> 01:31:12,642
[George] Rose?

992
01:31:12,726 --> 01:31:14,267
Can't Peter go with you today?

993
01:31:15,434 --> 01:31:18,684
Well, he could, but him and Phil
have kinda paired up.

994
01:31:18,767 --> 01:31:20,226
I don't want that.

995
01:31:20,309 --> 01:31:24,101
- I don't want him to be with Phil at all.
- But, Rose…

996
01:31:24,184 --> 01:31:25,142
[crying]

997
01:31:25,226 --> 01:31:28,642
[splutters] He's helping him.
He taught him how to ride.

998
01:31:30,934 --> 01:31:32,059
[uneasy music playing]

999
01:32:24,517 --> 01:32:25,685
Hey, Pete, my pal.

1000
01:32:29,685 --> 01:32:31,102
Hey, Pete, my pal.

1001
01:32:32,435 --> 01:32:33,435
You gonna help?

1002
01:32:52,393 --> 01:32:54,602
You know who started riding
as late as you?

1003
01:32:55,893 --> 01:32:58,227
- Who?
- Bronco Henry.

1004
01:32:59,685 --> 01:33:02,310
Hadn't done any of it
till he was about your age now.

1005
01:33:08,227 --> 01:33:09,643
Hello, Mr. Cottontail.

1006
01:33:17,018 --> 01:33:19,893
Hey, Peter, let's see how long it takes

1007
01:33:19,977 --> 01:33:22,643
before Mr. Cottontail
makes a run for the open.

1008
01:33:23,810 --> 01:33:28,893
Now, as kids,
we used to take bets… [grunts]

1009
01:33:28,977 --> 01:33:30,893
…on how many poles we'd remove

1010
01:33:30,977 --> 01:33:34,935
before the animals ran out
and made a run for it.

1011
01:33:46,268 --> 01:33:47,477
Oh, he's still in there.

1012
01:33:48,727 --> 01:33:50,061
Gutsy little bugger.

1013
01:33:51,186 --> 01:33:52,561
I guess he has to be gutsy.

1014
01:34:01,603 --> 01:34:03,228
[Phil] Damn son of a bitch.

1015
01:34:09,519 --> 01:34:11,728
[Peter] Come on, now. Come on.

1016
01:34:14,228 --> 01:34:15,436
Think it broke his leg.

1017
01:34:17,144 --> 01:34:19,478
Well, put him out of his misery.

1018
01:34:24,103 --> 01:34:25,144
[Peter] Hmm.

1019
01:34:27,103 --> 01:34:28,103
It's all right.

1020
01:34:29,769 --> 01:34:30,769
[rabbit neck snaps]

1021
01:34:35,811 --> 01:34:37,186
[groans softly]

1022
01:34:43,561 --> 01:34:44,728
[Peter] That's deep.

1023
01:34:46,478 --> 01:34:47,811
You okay, Phil?

1024
01:34:47,894 --> 01:34:48,978
Yeah, what the hell?

1025
01:34:50,978 --> 01:34:52,561
Must be a splinter.

1026
01:35:10,561 --> 01:35:13,061
You got a tan.
That's a cowboy tan you got.

1027
01:35:13,895 --> 01:35:14,729
Hmm.

1028
01:35:20,354 --> 01:35:21,770
Bronco Henry told me that…

1029
01:35:23,979 --> 01:35:26,687
A man was made
by patience and the odds against him.

1030
01:35:31,854 --> 01:35:33,520
[sighs] My father said…

1031
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:36,687
Obstacles.

1032
01:35:38,770 --> 01:35:40,520
And you had to try and remove them.

1033
01:35:40,604 --> 01:35:41,937
[Phil] Another way to put it.

1034
01:35:43,979 --> 01:35:48,562
Well, you've certainly got obstacles.
That's a fact, Pete, me boy.

1035
01:35:50,270 --> 01:35:52,437
- [Peter] "Obstacles"?
- Well, take your ma.

1036
01:35:53,729 --> 01:35:56,145
Today or any day…

1037
01:35:58,312 --> 01:35:59,562
How she's on the sauce.

1038
01:36:00,645 --> 01:36:01,854
[Peter] "On the sauce"?

1039
01:36:04,187 --> 01:36:05,187
Drinking, Pete.

1040
01:36:06,187 --> 01:36:07,312
Boozing it up.

1041
01:36:11,937 --> 01:36:13,979
I guess you know
she's been half-shot all summer.

1042
01:36:14,062 --> 01:36:16,312
Yeah, I know.

1043
01:36:19,229 --> 01:36:20,437
She never used to drink.

1044
01:36:21,270 --> 01:36:23,645
- Oh, didn't she now?
- [Peter] No.

1045
01:36:25,145 --> 01:36:27,604
- She never did.
- But your pa, Pete?

1046
01:36:29,354 --> 01:36:30,687
[Peter] My father?

1047
01:36:30,770 --> 01:36:31,979
Yeah, your father.

1048
01:36:34,895 --> 01:36:36,937
I guess he hit the bottle pretty hard?

1049
01:36:38,271 --> 01:36:39,271
The booze?

1050
01:36:42,355 --> 01:36:43,771
Until right at the very end.

1051
01:36:50,105 --> 01:36:51,188
Then he hung himself.

1052
01:36:54,980 --> 01:36:55,813
[gulps]

1053
01:36:56,355 --> 01:36:57,605
I found him.

1054
01:37:01,355 --> 01:37:02,355
Cut him down.

1055
01:37:10,646 --> 01:37:12,688
He used to worry I wasn't kind enough.

1056
01:37:16,438 --> 01:37:17,730
That I was too strong.

1057
01:37:17,813 --> 01:37:19,230
You, too strong?

1058
01:37:19,896 --> 01:37:20,813
[scoffs]

1059
01:37:21,355 --> 01:37:22,521
He got that wrong.

1060
01:37:24,730 --> 01:37:25,855
Poor kid.

1061
01:37:31,396 --> 01:37:33,063
Things will work out for you yet.

1062
01:37:35,563 --> 01:37:36,563
[Rose clears throat]

1063
01:37:38,980 --> 01:37:39,813
[coughs]

1064
01:37:44,688 --> 01:37:45,896
Where's Mrs. Lewis?

1065
01:37:46,688 --> 01:37:47,896
She's with the Indians.

1066
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:51,605
What Indians?

1067
01:37:53,521 --> 01:37:54,355
These ones.

1068
01:37:54,438 --> 01:37:56,980
- [speaks Shoshone]
- You shouldn't even be here.

1069
01:37:58,105 --> 01:37:59,230
He won't like it.

1070
01:38:00,021 --> 01:38:01,272
Go now. Go.

1071
01:38:04,814 --> 01:38:06,022
[footsteps approaching]

1072
01:38:06,106 --> 01:38:08,564
[Mrs. Lewis panting] Water!

1073
01:38:10,564 --> 01:38:13,772
They were standing right in front
of the damn things asking,

1074
01:38:13,856 --> 01:38:15,814
"Do we have any hides?"

1075
01:38:18,147 --> 01:38:21,439
"Do we have any hides?" Are they leaving?

1076
01:38:23,314 --> 01:38:25,106
Yes, they've got their horse going.

1077
01:38:25,897 --> 01:38:29,189
[Mrs. Lewis panting] I told them
the hides are gonna be burned.

1078
01:38:33,814 --> 01:38:34,897
Why?

1079
01:38:35,522 --> 01:38:37,772
Why are the hides going to be burned?

1080
01:38:37,856 --> 01:38:39,981
Phil doesn't want anyone else to have 'em.

1081
01:38:40,481 --> 01:38:43,814
Waits till there's a big pile
and sets fire to the lot.

1082
01:38:44,897 --> 01:38:47,481
[chuckles] He'd blow up
if they even touched 'em.

1083
01:38:47,564 --> 01:38:49,522
[spluttering]

1084
01:38:49,606 --> 01:38:50,606
What's she doin'?

1085
01:38:50,689 --> 01:38:52,689
[uneasy piano music playing]

1086
01:39:04,397 --> 01:39:06,981
[panting]

1087
01:39:08,231 --> 01:39:09,606
Please, please.

1088
01:39:11,689 --> 01:39:13,314
Wait! Please!

1089
01:39:16,106 --> 01:39:18,189
Wait! Please, stop.

1090
01:39:19,064 --> 01:39:20,064
Please wait.

1091
01:39:20,147 --> 01:39:21,522
[panting]

1092
01:39:21,606 --> 01:39:22,606
Please.

1093
01:39:23,606 --> 01:39:24,606
Come back.

1094
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:26,815
Take the hides.

1095
01:39:26,898 --> 01:39:30,398
It would be my honor
if you would take them.

1096
01:39:32,315 --> 01:39:33,315
Please.

1097
01:39:34,523 --> 01:39:36,023
My husband owns the ranch.

1098
01:39:39,023 --> 01:39:40,607
Come back. Take them.

1099
01:39:43,023 --> 01:39:44,273
[man speaking Shoshone]

1100
01:39:49,940 --> 01:39:51,940
[uneasy music playing]

1101
01:40:08,107 --> 01:40:09,107
[chuckles softly]

1102
01:40:12,107 --> 01:40:13,565
They're so soft.

1103
01:40:15,898 --> 01:40:18,357
[crying softly] So deliciously soft.

1104
01:40:20,607 --> 01:40:21,607
So beautiful.

1105
01:40:28,065 --> 01:40:29,065
[grunting]

1106
01:40:36,315 --> 01:40:37,773
[breathing heavily]

1107
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:44,732
[gasps, grunts]

1108
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:50,066
- [cowhand 1] You all right, ma'am?
- [cowhand 2] Is she breathing?

1109
01:40:50,149 --> 01:40:51,066
[cowhand 1] Ma'am.

1110
01:40:52,108 --> 01:40:53,441
- Ma'am.
- What happened?

1111
01:40:53,941 --> 01:40:55,608
[cowhand 2] She just collapsed, sir.

1112
01:40:59,191 --> 01:41:00,191
Rose?

1113
01:41:04,316 --> 01:41:05,983
[Rose groaning]

1114
01:41:21,816 --> 01:41:22,983
[Lola] Sorry, sir.

1115
01:41:24,358 --> 01:41:25,274
Thank you, Lola.

1116
01:41:37,191 --> 01:41:38,399
[Rose grunting]

1117
01:41:39,108 --> 01:41:39,983
[softly] Mine.

1118
01:41:43,358 --> 01:41:45,149
- [cowhand 1] Almost done.
- [cowhand 2] Howdy.

1119
01:41:45,233 --> 01:41:47,024
- [cowhand 3] Hey, boss.
- [cowhand 4] All right.

1120
01:41:47,108 --> 01:41:49,316
[cowhands speaking indistinctly]

1121
01:41:58,899 --> 01:42:00,191
[Phil] I'll be damned.

1122
01:42:00,733 --> 01:42:01,649
[grunts]

1123
01:42:02,274 --> 01:42:04,983
- [dramatic music playing]
- [Phil continues grunting]

1124
01:42:06,483 --> 01:42:09,316
[breathing heavily]

1125
01:42:10,566 --> 01:42:11,649
- [thud]
- [Phil grunts]

1126
01:42:12,149 --> 01:42:13,859
Is there something wrong, Phil?

1127
01:42:13,942 --> 01:42:14,942
[Phil] Wrong?

1128
01:42:15,609 --> 01:42:17,275
For Christ's sake.

1129
01:42:17,359 --> 01:42:19,984
Every goddamn hide is gone!

1130
01:42:20,817 --> 01:42:23,442
Oh, she really put
her foot into it this time.

1131
01:42:25,317 --> 01:42:26,525
You think she did it?

1132
01:42:27,942 --> 01:42:29,692
- She sold them?
- Bloody tootin'.

1133
01:42:30,984 --> 01:42:33,567
- Or maybe even gave them away.
- [Peter] Why? Why?

1134
01:42:33,650 --> 01:42:36,109
Why would she do that, Phil?
She knew that we needed the hides.

1135
01:42:36,192 --> 01:42:38,109
Because she was drunk!

1136
01:42:39,067 --> 01:42:41,650
Pie-eyed! She was smashed!

1137
01:42:42,984 --> 01:42:44,984
I'd think you'd know
from the books your pa left you

1138
01:42:45,067 --> 01:42:47,400
that your ma's got a… a whatchamacallit.

1139
01:42:48,150 --> 01:42:51,984
Alcoholic personality.
It comes under the letter A!

1140
01:42:59,442 --> 01:43:02,692
- You're not gonna say anything to her?
- [Phil] Say anything?

1141
01:43:02,775 --> 01:43:04,109
I won't say nothin'.

1142
01:43:05,692 --> 01:43:08,900
But sure as one good hell,
brother George is going to.

1143
01:43:18,359 --> 01:43:19,859
[George] Rose is not well, Phil.

1144
01:43:22,734 --> 01:43:23,650
She's ill.

1145
01:43:26,275 --> 01:43:27,859
Not well?

1146
01:43:27,942 --> 01:43:29,609
[breathing heavily]

1147
01:43:29,692 --> 01:43:34,109
It is high time
that that bozo and you got next to a few…

1148
01:43:34,192 --> 01:43:36,442
What do you ever call them? Facts!

1149
01:43:36,525 --> 01:43:41,568
She stashes alcohol all around the place,
even drinking in the stinking alley.

1150
01:43:44,193 --> 01:43:46,360
Look at your face in the mirror!

1151
01:43:46,443 --> 01:43:50,860
Is it that she could like?
Or our money? Wake the hell up!

1152
01:43:50,943 --> 01:43:52,026
That's enough, Phil.

1153
01:43:57,318 --> 01:43:59,985
Well, what is the harm?

1154
01:44:00,735 --> 01:44:02,693
The hides were only going to be burned.

1155
01:44:03,568 --> 01:44:04,651
I needed them.

1156
01:44:06,151 --> 01:44:07,735
I needed them.

1157
01:44:09,651 --> 01:44:11,068
Well, I apologize.

1158
01:44:22,485 --> 01:44:23,776
They were mine!

1159
01:44:27,735 --> 01:44:28,735
I needed them!

1160
01:44:40,776 --> 01:44:41,985
[sighs]

1161
01:44:44,943 --> 01:44:46,651
- Phil?
- Huh?

1162
01:44:53,818 --> 01:44:54,818
[Peter] Phil, I've…

1163
01:44:57,110 --> 01:44:58,943
I've got rawhide to finish the rope.

1164
01:45:01,569 --> 01:45:02,986
[Phil] You've got it?

1165
01:45:03,069 --> 01:45:05,027
What are you doing with rawhide?

1166
01:45:05,527 --> 01:45:06,611
I cut some up.

1167
01:45:07,986 --> 01:45:09,402
I wanted to be like you.

1168
01:45:11,486 --> 01:45:12,944
Please take what I've got.

1169
01:45:16,986 --> 01:45:18,194
Well…

1170
01:45:18,277 --> 01:45:20,111
That's damn kind of you, Pete.

1171
01:45:35,486 --> 01:45:36,694
Tell you something.

1172
01:45:39,736 --> 01:45:43,236
Everything's gonna be plain sailing
for you from now on in.

1173
01:45:46,986 --> 01:45:48,069
And you know what?

1174
01:45:49,027 --> 01:45:50,027
I'm gonna work.

1175
01:45:51,444 --> 01:45:53,069
Finish up that rope tonight.

1176
01:45:56,444 --> 01:45:58,194
<i>You'll watch me do it?</i>

1177
01:45:58,277 --> 01:45:59,694
[uneasy music playing]

1178
01:48:19,571 --> 01:48:20,488
[dings]

1179
01:48:27,446 --> 01:48:29,571
How old were you
when you met Bronco Henry?

1180
01:48:31,779 --> 01:48:33,196
About the age you are now.

1181
01:48:43,738 --> 01:48:44,946
Was he your best friend?

1182
01:48:46,321 --> 01:48:49,654
Yeah… he was.

1183
01:48:51,113 --> 01:48:52,321
He was more than that.

1184
01:48:54,488 --> 01:48:56,029
Once, he saved my life.

1185
01:49:02,946 --> 01:49:07,071
We were way off up in the hills
shooting elk, and the weather turned mean.

1186
01:49:09,571 --> 01:49:15,155
Bronco kept me alive
by… lying body against body in a bedroll.

1187
01:49:18,780 --> 01:49:20,364
Fell off to sleep that way.

1188
01:49:26,322 --> 01:49:27,322
Naked?

1189
01:49:30,489 --> 01:49:31,322
[chuckles]

1190

[uneasy music playing]

1192
01:51:23,406 --> 01:51:25,865
- [cowhand 1] Phil left already?
- [cowhand 2] No, he's not here.

1193
01:51:28,198 --> 01:51:29,906
He say he was settin' out early?

1194
01:51:29,990 --> 01:51:30,990
[cowhand 2] No.

1195
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:37,573
[George] Good mornin'.

1196
01:51:38,698 --> 01:51:40,115
Have you seen your brother?

1197
01:51:42,490 --> 01:51:43,906
He's not had breakfast?

1198
01:51:45,948 --> 01:51:47,406
He's not been down at all.

1199
01:51:50,865 --> 01:51:52,740
[cowhand 3] Can I get
some of that coffee please?

1200
01:52:10,991 --> 01:52:13,199
I'll run you into Herndon
to see the doctor.

1201
01:52:13,866 --> 01:52:14,907
[Phil groans softly]

1202
01:52:39,032 --> 01:52:39,949
[George] Phil…

1203
01:52:42,032 --> 01:52:43,574
What happened to your hand?

1204
01:52:47,116 --> 01:52:48,449
Let's get your boots off.

1205
01:52:57,699 --> 01:52:58,532
[Phil grunts]

1206
01:52:59,366 --> 01:53:00,699
I'm… I'm good.

1207
01:53:09,699 --> 01:53:11,116
[George] I'll get the car.

1208
01:53:13,991 --> 01:53:15,324
[door closes]

1209
01:53:17,574 --> 01:53:19,782

[somber music playing]

1211
01:54:17,158 --> 01:54:18,367
[George] Let's go, Phil.

1212
01:54:19,617 --> 01:54:20,783
Where's the boy?

1213
01:54:44,367 --> 01:54:45,283
Phil.

1214
01:54:54,826 --> 01:54:55,826
I'll get it to him.

1215
01:55:04,784 --> 01:55:05,618
[sniffs]

1216
01:55:08,451 --> 01:55:09,951

[engine splutters]

1218
01:55:49,201 --> 01:55:50,451
I'll take this one.

1219
01:55:52,909 --> 01:55:53,743
Uh…

1220
01:55:56,659 --> 01:55:58,784
[indistinct chatter in background]

[indistinct chatter]

1226
01:57:55,578 --> 01:58:02,161
Rose would like you to join us
for Christmas, if you care to.

1227
01:58:05,953 --> 01:58:06,786
Yes.

1228
01:58:07,911 --> 01:58:09,078
Thank you, George.

1229
01:58:14,370 --> 01:58:15,703
I'm afraid I'm mystified.

1230
01:58:16,661 --> 01:58:19,328
I'll know in a day or two
when the results come back.

1231
01:58:20,161 --> 01:58:21,453
Those last convulsions…

1232
01:58:23,828 --> 01:58:26,953
- Yes?
- Terrible, truly frightful.

1233
01:58:28,953 --> 01:58:30,328
You know what I'm thinking?

1234
01:58:31,245 --> 01:58:32,161
What?

1235
01:58:33,245 --> 01:58:34,245
Anthrax.

1236
01:58:38,953 --> 01:58:42,161
But he never handled diseased animals.

1237
01:58:42,245 --> 01:58:43,953
He was particular on that.

1238
01:58:45,536 --> 01:58:46,870

1239
01:59:40,537 --> 01:59:42,912
[Peter] "Deliver my soul from the sword,

1240
01:59:42,996 --> 01:59:45,121
my darling from the power of the dog."
