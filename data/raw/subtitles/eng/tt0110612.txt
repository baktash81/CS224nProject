00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,369
- 353 Central Park West.
- How do you want to get there?

2
00:02:00,504 --> 00:02:01,833
By taxi?

3
00:02:50,394 --> 00:02:52,433
OK, wait. We'll be down soon.

4
00:02:55,316 --> 00:02:58,317
Something from Paris.
Pete, Camembert.

5
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,402
Thanks. Listen,
l wanted to warn you,

6
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,737
Niki's different
than when you last saw her.

7
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:04,574
How can she be, in a year and a half?

8
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:07,572
- She's 14 now.
- Well, so?

9
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:20,003
- Niki, are you ready?
- Nicole! Nicole! Cherie!

10
00:03:21,762 --> 00:03:24,680
Oh, yes.
Good boy, good boy. Get down!

11
00:03:24,807 --> 00:03:26,884
- She's not ready yet.
- The taxi's waiting.

12
00:03:27,018 --> 00:03:29,509
lt's going to cost
more than the airplane.

13
00:03:29,646 --> 00:03:31,473
Get down!

14
00:03:31,607 --> 00:03:35,023
Be nice to him.
He's been through a lot, lately.

15
00:03:36,779 --> 00:03:38,274
He doesn't remember me.

16
00:03:39,657 --> 00:03:43,157
- He's peeing on me!
- That proves he remembers you.

17
00:03:43,286 --> 00:03:45,908
Get down! He's like a fountain.

18
00:04:19,703 --> 00:04:22,276
Oh, Nicole!

19
00:04:22,414 --> 00:04:24,786
- Nicole!
- Daddy, l missed you so much.

20
00:04:24,917 --> 00:04:26,826
- Oh, ma cherie, tu vas bien?
- l'm fine.

21
00:04:26,961 --> 00:04:28,752
- Tu es superbe!
- You look good, too.

22
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,667
- Parle Francaise un peau.
- l don't speak French any more.

23
00:04:31,799 --> 00:04:33,508
- What do you mean?
- Niki, what's this?

24
00:04:33,635 --> 00:04:35,427
What?

25
00:04:35,554 --> 00:04:37,879
l told you not to take
my things without asking.

26
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,295
You go through my stuff now?

27
00:04:39,433 --> 00:04:41,640
- What's going on here?
- l have no privacy.

28
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:45,020
ln the future,
ask before you take my things. Here.

29
00:04:45,148 --> 00:04:48,932
- No, l don't want your jacket.
- Now, ladies, please.

30
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:51,739
- She never lets me have anything.
- Take it.

31
00:04:51,864 --> 00:04:53,987
- l don't want it.
- Take the damn thing.

32
00:04:54,116 --> 00:04:56,323
Oh, good idea.
Put on a show for Daddy.

33
00:04:56,452 --> 00:04:58,944
- OK, kiss your mama goodbye.
- Let's go.

34
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,951
- Let's go.
- You see what l live with.

35
00:05:02,084 --> 00:05:04,540
One of these days l'm leaving
and never coming back.

36
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,627
- Go live with your father.
- You're a bitch.

37
00:05:06,756 --> 00:05:09,792
- Nicole!
- Do you hear how she talks to me?

38
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:11,919
Where did you learn
to talk like that?

39
00:05:12,053 --> 00:05:15,304
- From you.
- From me! I never said it.

40
00:05:15,432 --> 00:05:18,386
You apologise before you go,
or you're not coming back here.

41
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,761
- Fine!
- No, apologise to your mother.

42
00:05:20,897 --> 00:05:22,225
- No!
- Oh.

43
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:23,899
She apologise.

44
00:05:25,652 --> 00:05:27,063
Shut up!

45
00:05:29,656 --> 00:05:33,240
- Give me that bag, Andre.
- Andre? Why do you call me Andre?

46
00:05:33,369 --> 00:05:35,943
All my friends call their parents
by their first names.

47
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,204
OK, fine, call me Andre.

48
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:43,042
Niki! Niki, sweetheart,
you didn't kiss me goodbye.

49
00:05:45,007 --> 00:05:46,170
Oh, Niki!

50
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,461
Oh, you want to come with me.
l don't blame you.

51
00:05:51,973 --> 00:05:53,847
Oh, Mommy, l'm so sorry.

52
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,269
She call her Mommy.

53
00:05:56,687 --> 00:05:58,312
l love you, baby.

54
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:00,562
l love you, too.
l'm really going to miss you.

55
00:06:00,691 --> 00:06:02,352
Come on, come on, let's go. Come on!

56
00:06:02,485 --> 00:06:04,110
Call me as soon as you get there.

57
00:06:04,237 --> 00:06:06,444
- Take my jacket.
- No, no, forget it.

58
00:06:06,573 --> 00:06:07,652
No.

59
00:06:07,783 --> 00:06:09,740
- You'll need it.
- No, l don't want it.

60
00:06:09,868 --> 00:06:11,363
- Give it to me!
- l don't want it.

61
00:06:11,495 --> 00:06:13,784
Take the jacket.
lt gets cold there at night.

62
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,744
- OK.
- She listens to a total stranger!

63
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:21,247
- OK, Bye-bye.
- Have a great time. Bye.

64
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,466
Oh, stop, please.

65
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:27,381
Take the dog. The dog!

66
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:31,972
l got it.

67
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:41,317
Attention, all passengers,
Air France flight...

68
00:06:41,446 --> 00:06:43,154
ls she your daughter?

69
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:46,235
Yes. She's beautiful, no?

70
00:06:46,368 --> 00:06:50,069
- Are you close?
- lnseparable.

71
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:57,209
There you go, honey.

72
00:06:58,215 --> 00:07:00,254
Ecoute, Nicole. Jamais...

73
00:07:00,384 --> 00:07:02,756
l told you,
l don't speak French any more.

74
00:07:07,141 --> 00:07:09,348
Eugh! This is gross! What is it?

75
00:07:09,477 --> 00:07:11,600
Your favourite. A Shirley Temple.

76
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,482
l don't drink Shirley Temples
any more. l'm nearly 15.

77
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:15,639
Where have you been?

78
00:07:16,527 --> 00:07:20,525
Nicole. Niki.

79
00:07:20,698 --> 00:07:24,281
l know you're angry at me because
l'm never here, but l have to work.

80
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:27,578
l thought of you all the time.
l wrote you a letter every week.

81
00:07:28,457 --> 00:07:30,414
Yeah, l got them.

82
00:07:30,543 --> 00:07:33,164
Good. l'll get you a Coke.

83
00:07:51,483 --> 00:07:53,392
A dry martini!

84
00:07:53,527 --> 00:07:55,734
Did you ask her to come, too?

85
00:07:55,863 --> 00:07:57,903
Who?

86
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,574
Nicole! Nicole!

87
00:08:05,123 --> 00:08:07,116
Nicole!

88
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:09,824
Nicole! What's the matter?
What did l do?

89
00:08:09,962 --> 00:08:12,418
- l'm not going with you.
- You are going with me.

90
00:08:12,548 --> 00:08:14,588
l planned this trip for a year.

91
00:08:14,717 --> 00:08:17,635
You're going to have
the best vacation you've ever had,

92
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:20,336
whether you like it or not!
Understand?

93
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,848
Go back to the island, boy

94
00:08:29,985 --> 00:08:33,734
Get up early one morning,
kiss my mama goodbye

95
00:08:33,864 --> 00:08:37,696
Going back to the island, l say,
Don't worry, Mama, don't cry

96
00:08:41,623 --> 00:08:43,663
Yeah

97
00:08:45,752 --> 00:08:47,792
Yeah

98
00:08:49,924 --> 00:08:51,964
Yeah

99
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,470
Are you ready?
How you going to get there?

100
00:08:58,308 --> 00:09:01,393
Are you ready?
How you going to get there?

101
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,560
By mail boat?

102
00:09:04,732 --> 00:09:06,891
Here we are. Look at it.

103
00:09:07,026 --> 00:09:10,063
- Magnifique! lsn't it beautiful?
- lt's OK.

104
00:09:12,074 --> 00:09:13,402
lt's OK...

105
00:09:15,411 --> 00:09:17,534
What do you think?

106
00:09:17,663 --> 00:09:20,071
- Everybody's so old.
- Old?

107
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:23,498
To you l probably seem old, huh?

108
00:09:23,628 --> 00:09:25,954
You are old.

109
00:09:26,715 --> 00:09:28,957
Oh, look, there is a young person.

110
00:09:29,093 --> 00:09:31,667
Too late. They got him.

111
00:09:32,555 --> 00:09:34,678
Hello. Mr. Amel.

112
00:09:35,892 --> 00:09:38,016
Mr. Amel, may l have your address?

113
00:09:49,157 --> 00:09:51,316
- Are you all right?
- l'm fine.

114
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:54,073
Let's go. There's obviously
nothing for me to do here.

115
00:09:54,205 --> 00:09:57,122
What do you mean, there is a lot
for a young person to do.

116
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,326
Rumba class starts in five minutes.

117
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:01,500
l can't wait.

118
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:08,594
Call the front desk
and tell them we need two bedrooms.

119
00:10:08,721 --> 00:10:10,714
You heard them.
They are all booked up.

120
00:10:10,848 --> 00:10:13,090
- Can l explain something, Andre?
- Please.

121
00:10:13,226 --> 00:10:15,800
l'm a grown woman. You can't expect
me to sleep in a room

122
00:10:15,937 --> 00:10:16,969
with a strange man.

123
00:10:17,105 --> 00:10:19,394
l'm not a strange man.
l'm your father.

124
00:10:20,693 --> 00:10:22,436
You just don't get it, do you?

125
00:10:25,448 --> 00:10:27,275
Look, l shall sleep here.

126
00:10:29,036 --> 00:10:31,075
More comfortable.

127
00:10:31,955 --> 00:10:33,995
Aaah.

128
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,460
- Good night.
- Good night.

129
00:10:56,024 --> 00:10:59,725
Hi, I'm out. Leave a message
after the tone. Thanks. Bye.

130
00:11:01,238 --> 00:11:03,860
Isabel, are you there?

131
00:11:03,992 --> 00:11:06,483
I am at the hotel. Call me.

132
00:11:07,537 --> 00:11:10,029
I want to talk to you.

133
00:11:29,395 --> 00:11:30,427
Oh, Daddy?

134
00:11:31,523 --> 00:11:32,523
Oui, cherie?

135
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,062
Don't walk around in your underwear.
lt's really gross.

136
00:12:44,772 --> 00:12:47,180
lt's beautiful, isn't it?

137
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:50,608
lt's OK.

138
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:00,915
I'm sorry I wasn't home
when you called, Andre.

139
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,454
But I've gone out of town
for a while. I can't think in Paris.

140
00:13:05,587 --> 00:13:08,707
There's just so many decisions
to make about us.

141
00:13:08,841 --> 00:13:11,842
While you're on vacation,
please think about what I said, OK?

142
00:13:11,969 --> 00:13:13,380
I love you.

143
00:13:13,513 --> 00:13:15,552
Merde!

144
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:18,431
She can't think in Paris.

145
00:13:20,062 --> 00:13:22,600
- We're from Scranton.
- Ever heard of it?

146
00:13:22,731 --> 00:13:26,895
Small Businessmen's Association.
Got a great deal to come down here.

147
00:13:27,028 --> 00:13:29,317
How much are you paying
for your bungalow, Andy?

148
00:13:29,447 --> 00:13:30,823
- Mike!
- Oh.

149
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:33,903
- Stella, this is Andy. He's French.
- Hi.

150
00:13:34,036 --> 00:13:36,194
- Oh, he's not French!
- l'm not?

151
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,572
l know what French people look like.

152
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,285
What do they look like?

153
00:13:40,418 --> 00:13:43,253
Catherine Deneuve, Louis Jourdan.
They're French.

154
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,666
He's too big. Look at him.
He could sell shade for a living.

155
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,505
We did France in '89.
Or was that ltaly?

156
00:13:49,637 --> 00:13:51,843
Spain.
The place was crawling with bulls.

157
00:13:51,973 --> 00:13:54,464
Everywhere l looked,
there was a big bull.

158
00:13:55,727 --> 00:13:59,855
Yeah, well, whatever. Anyway, we got
first class seats for coach prices.

159
00:13:59,982 --> 00:14:03,185
The room was half price.
Free breakfast, too.

160
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:05,727
Oh, fascinating. Excuse me.

161
00:14:07,115 --> 00:14:08,692
Au revoir, Andre.

162
00:14:08,825 --> 00:14:10,533
Au revoir.

163
00:14:33,728 --> 00:14:36,932
- Who was that?
- Pablo. You scared him off.

164
00:14:37,065 --> 00:14:38,441
l can see he's the shy type.

165
00:14:40,986 --> 00:14:43,193
And who's that, His parole officer?

166
00:14:44,782 --> 00:14:46,822
l'm going to the beach.

167
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:50,278
- See ya.
- What's that?

168
00:14:50,413 --> 00:14:53,415
- What are you wearing?
- My bathing suit.

169
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:55,167
- The whole thing?
- You don't like it?

170
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,868
Are you sure you didn't leave
part of it in the box?

171
00:14:58,005 --> 00:15:00,331
Get real, Andre.
Everybody's wearing them.

172
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:03,175
Everyone's staring at you.

173
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:05,095
No, everyone's staring at you.

174
00:15:05,222 --> 00:15:07,262
l insist you change.

175
00:15:07,391 --> 00:15:09,550
And l insist you loosen up,
Andre, dear.

176
00:15:12,105 --> 00:15:14,477
Now, she's French.

177
00:15:14,607 --> 00:15:15,687
Ouch!

178
00:15:15,817 --> 00:15:18,653
Pablo's playing at a party tomorrow
and he's invited me.

179
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:21,448
- We can go after supper.
- Daddy, you're not invited.

180
00:15:21,574 --> 00:15:24,777
- Well, l'm inviting me.
- l can't show up with my father.

181
00:15:24,911 --> 00:15:27,580
Then you can't go. l don't want you
going out with that boy.

182
00:15:27,706 --> 00:15:30,031
- l'm not going out with him.
- l said no!

183
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:31,626
Why? Because he's black?

184
00:15:31,752 --> 00:15:33,994
Not because he's black.
Because you're 14.

185
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:35,624
Fourteen and a half.

186
00:15:35,756 --> 00:15:37,796
- Besides, he's a musician.
- So?

187
00:15:37,925 --> 00:15:41,840
So you can't date a musician
until all the other men are dead.

188
00:15:41,972 --> 00:15:45,175
Stop overdoing this father stuff,
it's not impressing me.

189
00:15:45,309 --> 00:15:46,803
l'm not doing it to impress you.

190
00:15:46,936 --> 00:15:49,806
You can't make up for being gone
five years in two weeks.

191
00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:52,430
- l've been around.
- You could have fooled me.

192
00:15:53,735 --> 00:15:55,775
Nicole!

193
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,182
This beach is private property.

194
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:12,853
- How'd you get here, anyway?
- l walked here.

195
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:14,900
You walked here? That was stupid.

196
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:18,120
A young kid like yourself
walking under those cliffs.

197
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:21,948
A kid? Please! l'm 18.

198
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:23,283
Ha!

199
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:25,079
Well, be careful, 18-year-old,

200
00:17:25,213 --> 00:17:28,582
because high tide comes in at 3:15,
and you'll be stuck out here.

201
00:17:29,426 --> 00:17:31,170
Do you live here or something?

202
00:17:31,303 --> 00:17:33,343
My parents have a house
down the beach.

203
00:17:33,472 --> 00:17:35,512
Are you here with your parents?

204
00:17:37,644 --> 00:17:39,518
A friend.

205
00:17:40,564 --> 00:17:43,020
Well, good luck walking back.

206
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:47,443
She walked here! Shhhh!

207
00:18:00,127 --> 00:18:03,378
- Did you have a nice day?
- Yeah, great.

208
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,377
Once the Europeans unite
in the Common Market,

209
00:18:10,514 --> 00:18:13,302
they'll be facing off against
the Americans. Watch out!

210
00:18:13,434 --> 00:18:14,465
Oh, yeah. Watch out.

211
00:18:14,602 --> 00:18:18,102
What both sides really want is access
to the Russian markets. Think of it.

212
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:21,351
250 million customers, presto,
like that!

213
00:18:21,485 --> 00:18:26,443
All anxious to spend their roubles
on Reeboks and cappuccino machines.

214
00:18:26,574 --> 00:18:28,531
Think of it! Ah, there is Nicole.

215
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,067
Nicole, this is Raymond.
Raymond, Nicole.

216
00:18:32,289 --> 00:18:34,281
How's it goingNice day, huh?

217
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,872
Raymond is from New York, too.

218
00:18:37,002 --> 00:18:39,244
- Really?
- Bronx High School of Science.

219
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,420
- How about you?
- l go to Hewitt.

220
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:44,219
Good school.
Outstanding humanities programme.

221
00:18:44,344 --> 00:18:48,176
l'm into economics myself, aiming for
Harvard Business School. Get my MBA,

222
00:18:48,307 --> 00:18:53,384
and then get into something sexy
like film. How about you?

223
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,689
l like to shop.

224
00:18:55,815 --> 00:18:59,101
A consumer. Good.
The more of you, the better!

225
00:19:02,406 --> 00:19:04,066
l'm going for a swim.

226
00:19:05,826 --> 00:19:08,532
Andre, what are your thoughts
on the Maastricht Treaty?

227
00:19:08,663 --> 00:19:10,288
l know France has been behind it,

228
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:13,452
but now the socialists are out
on their butts, do you think...

229
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:17,797
Well, if France drops out, then
Germany would get that much stronger.

230
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,340
- l'm dying.
- Here he is.

231
00:19:22,136 --> 00:19:24,129
Andre, this is my friend, Diana.

232
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:27,514
- Nice to meet you, Andre.
- My pleasure.

233
00:19:27,643 --> 00:19:29,303
Didn't l tell you he was cute?

234
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:31,097
He's very cute.

235
00:19:32,064 --> 00:19:34,638
You two get acquainted.
l'm going for a swim.

236
00:19:36,736 --> 00:19:40,604
l think it was Niki's plan for me
to distract you, so l'll do my best.

237
00:19:40,741 --> 00:19:44,276
- So, Niki says you're divorced.
- Yes, but l have a girlfriend.

238
00:19:44,412 --> 00:19:47,615
Oh, well, good.
l'm glad we got that out of the way.

239
00:19:47,749 --> 00:19:49,991
- ls she here with you?
- No, she's in Paris.

240
00:19:50,126 --> 00:19:53,994
Ah!
Lovely city, Paris. So romantic.

241
00:19:54,131 --> 00:19:56,124
So... far away.

242
00:19:56,258 --> 00:19:59,425
You know, my psychic said l would
fall in love with a rich ltalian.

243
00:19:59,554 --> 00:20:02,127
- l'm French.
- Close enough.

244
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:14,895
- l travel all the time.
- Oh, that sounds so great.

245
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:19,359
l was in Tahiti a few weeks ago,
and l'm going off to Rome next week.

246
00:20:19,493 --> 00:20:22,613
- Oh, that's wonderful.
- Yeah, l just never stay at home.

247
00:20:22,746 --> 00:20:24,989
Andre, this is David.
He's a photographer.

248
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:26,868
- Here you go, beautiful.
- Thanks.

249
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:30,453
- l want to take pictures of Niki.
- l'll send you some.

250
00:20:30,589 --> 00:20:32,213
Thank Grandpa for the drink.

251
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:35,300
What's the matter with you?

252
00:20:35,427 --> 00:20:37,088
Some choice of friends you have!

253
00:20:37,221 --> 00:20:39,547
A middle-aged lecher
and a crackhead musician.

254
00:20:39,682 --> 00:20:41,924
- You're a pain.
- l know, l know.

255
00:20:53,364 --> 00:20:55,488
- Nicole, are you all right?
- l'm fine.

256
00:20:56,493 --> 00:20:58,533
- l'm starving.
- l'm coming.

257
00:21:05,962 --> 00:21:07,373
What?

258
00:21:08,465 --> 00:21:10,790
Nothing. Nothing at all.

259
00:21:17,975 --> 00:21:19,933
Why are you walking like that?

260
00:21:20,061 --> 00:21:22,813
- Like what?
- Walk normally.

261
00:21:22,939 --> 00:21:24,979
l am walking normally.

262
00:21:28,404 --> 00:21:31,489
That's the guy. l'm telling you, man.

263
00:21:31,616 --> 00:21:34,321
- He must have money.
- A lot of money.

264
00:21:35,871 --> 00:21:39,655
He said, "Take this advice from me,
Go back to the coconut tree

265
00:21:39,792 --> 00:21:41,416
What l need
is gin and coconut water

266
00:21:41,544 --> 00:21:43,620
Jelly coconut
Gin and coconut water...

267
00:21:43,754 --> 00:21:45,794
Nicole.

268
00:21:45,924 --> 00:21:49,625
..and coconut water
Can l get it in America?

269
00:21:49,761 --> 00:21:54,009
Andre, you're in luck. l'm still
single. How about you?

270
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,237
Hi.

271
00:22:15,373 --> 00:22:17,865
For your information,
l walked here, too.

272
00:22:18,001 --> 00:22:21,371
- You look great.
- Thanks.

273
00:22:23,174 --> 00:22:24,882
Your friend?

274
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:27,168
- Andre?
- Yeah, is he your boyfriend?

275
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:30,342
Yeah. Yeah, he's my boyfriend.

276
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:34,060
lt's none of my business,
but he looks pretty ancient.

277
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:38,683
He's not that old.
Besides, l like older men.

278
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:41,187
Do you sleep with him?

279
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:43,811
- No!
- You don't?

280
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:46,355
No. l mean, yeah,
but not in the same room.

281
00:22:46,492 --> 00:22:49,908
- Not in the same room?
- Not technically in the same room.

282
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:52,908
When we travel, he has to tell people
he's my father.

283
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:56,327
- Why?
- Well, l'm not 18 like l said l was.

284
00:22:56,461 --> 00:22:58,371
That's pretty obvious.
How old are you?

285
00:22:59,089 --> 00:23:00,089
16.

286
00:23:00,216 --> 00:23:03,632
He has to pretend he's my father,
because of all the stupid laws.

287
00:23:03,761 --> 00:23:06,716
But working here, l'm sure
you see that kind of thing a lot.

288
00:23:06,848 --> 00:23:08,224
All the time.

289
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:11,517
- Ben, are we going dancing?
- Uh, yeah, maybe.

290
00:23:11,645 --> 00:23:13,852
l'll see you tomorrow, OK?

291
00:23:16,025 --> 00:23:17,436
Yeah, maybe.

292
00:23:23,492 --> 00:23:25,568
- What's your name?
- Niki.

293
00:23:25,703 --> 00:23:29,072
Niki. l'm Ben. lt's nice to meet you.

294
00:23:42,013 --> 00:23:45,631
- How come you're sitting all alone?
- l'm hiding from your friend.

295
00:23:45,767 --> 00:23:48,389
- Diana?
- Yes, Diana, goddess of the hunt.

296
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,643
Oh, come on, she's not that bad.

297
00:24:01,201 --> 00:24:03,360
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.

298
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,498
What do you want?

299
00:24:06,624 --> 00:24:09,411
l don't have to want anything
from my daddy, do l?

300
00:24:10,587 --> 00:24:12,626
Ah!

301
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,258
She told Ben all about it
this afternoon.

302
00:24:17,386 --> 00:24:19,545
- lt's disgusting.
- l told you he was French.

303
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,050
- l wish l had an accent.
- Give me that.

304
00:24:31,527 --> 00:24:34,101
Patty, you've described
your life at home...

305
00:24:34,238 --> 00:24:35,781
Nicole!

306
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,070
..living hell.

307
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,035
- What happened when you were 17?
- Nicole!

308
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:41,989
That's when I went to live
with Dwayne.

309
00:24:42,122 --> 00:24:44,495
My mother's a prostitute
and my father's doing time

310
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:45,625
for armed robbery.

311
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:47,661
I'd have done anything
to get out of there.

312
00:24:47,795 --> 00:24:50,251
- Nicole!
- What?

313
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:52,627
Come here and look.

314
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:54,799
- Look at what?
- The moon.

315
00:24:54,928 --> 00:24:57,799
- What about it?
- lt's rising.

316
00:24:57,932 --> 00:24:58,932
Great.

317
00:24:59,058 --> 00:25:02,225
- ..learned to sniff model glue.
- lt's magnificent!

318
00:25:02,353 --> 00:25:06,102
Turn that off
and come here and look at it.

319
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:08,272
ln a minute.

320
00:25:08,402 --> 00:25:09,813
Hurry up.

321
00:25:09,945 --> 00:25:11,985
Hold on, it's not going anywhere.

322
00:25:12,114 --> 00:25:17,406
Get out here and look at
the goddamn moon. lt's glorious.

323
00:25:25,129 --> 00:25:28,830
lt's not like l've never seen
the moon before.

324
00:25:29,843 --> 00:25:31,882
Where is it?

325
00:25:32,888 --> 00:25:34,928
lt'll be out again in a minute.

326
00:25:38,978 --> 00:25:41,765
- Where are you going?
- For a walk.

327
00:25:51,325 --> 00:25:53,199
lt's pretty, isn't it?

328
00:25:53,327 --> 00:25:55,237
- Hi.
- What are you doing?

329
00:25:55,371 --> 00:25:56,949
Going for a walk. You?

330
00:25:57,082 --> 00:26:01,127
- l was on my way home.
- Want some company?

331
00:26:01,253 --> 00:26:02,712
Sure.

332
00:26:02,838 --> 00:26:05,080
I miss you, Andre,

333
00:26:05,216 --> 00:26:11,670
but I've decided I can't go on
feeling that you're not there for me.

334
00:26:11,807 --> 00:26:15,721
I need more, or maybe less.
I don't know.

335
00:26:15,853 --> 00:26:18,344
I need an answer, that's all.

336
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:29,030
So, he's like your sugar daddy?

337
00:26:30,035 --> 00:26:32,075
Yeah, sort of.

338
00:26:32,955 --> 00:26:34,995
- He saved me.
- From what?

339
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:38,909
From my boyfriend Dwayne.
From a life on the streets.

340
00:26:40,088 --> 00:26:44,039
When l met Andre, l was a runaway.
l was into dope pretty bad.

341
00:26:45,261 --> 00:26:46,886
ReallyYou were?

342
00:26:47,013 --> 00:26:50,465
Well, l started with the easy stuff.
You know, like sniffing glue.

343
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,270
Stuff like that.
Then l went to the hard stuff.

344
00:26:54,563 --> 00:26:57,399
l was stealing to support my habit
and l got busted.

345
00:26:59,152 --> 00:27:02,853
That's when Andre found me.
He turned my life around.

346
00:27:04,157 --> 00:27:06,483
So, he's like a father to you?

347
00:27:06,618 --> 00:27:08,279
You could say that, yeah.

348
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,540
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

349
00:27:15,879 --> 00:27:17,670
Have you met any nice men yet?

350
00:27:17,798 --> 00:27:20,087
Besides youNo.

351
00:27:20,217 --> 00:27:23,633
- What about them?
- Oh, them?

352
00:27:23,763 --> 00:27:26,883
The men that God forgot?
l'm not interested.

353
00:27:27,016 --> 00:27:29,555
You're very attractive, you know.

354
00:27:30,729 --> 00:27:33,220
lf l were not already spoken for...

355
00:27:33,357 --> 00:27:36,275
And how is the person
who's speaking for you?

356
00:27:37,069 --> 00:27:40,653
lsabel?
She's angry at me for some reason.

357
00:27:40,782 --> 00:27:44,732
Then she disappears because
she said she can't think in Paris.

358
00:27:44,912 --> 00:27:47,118
What does she mean,
she can't think in Paris?

359
00:27:47,247 --> 00:27:48,872
Descartes thought in Paris.

360
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:53,413
So did Rousseau and Jean Paul Sartre.
lt was good enough for them.

361
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:56,666
She probably just needs
to get away from you for a while.

362
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,876
l don't understand women.

363
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:02,095
So, what is it about us
that you don't understand?

364
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:04,679
Everything. Everything!

365
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:06,802
l don't understand
my ex-wife or my lover,

366
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:11,266
and l especially do not understand
my daughter. She hates me.

367
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,816
Don't be silly. Niki idolises you.

368
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:20,696
My father?
He's in prison for armed robbery.

369
00:28:20,827 --> 00:28:24,825
He knocked off a liquor store, shot
the owner, took customers hostage.

370
00:28:24,957 --> 00:28:27,626
He drove through five states
before they caught him.

371
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:32,248
- So, has Niki ever been in love?
- Nicoleln loveOf course not.

372
00:28:32,382 --> 00:28:35,253
What does she know about love?
She's too young.

373
00:28:35,385 --> 00:28:38,303
She doesn't know anything about men,
you know.

374
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,423
She thinks
love is like some fairy tale.

375
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:43,642
My mother's a prostitute.
She ran off with her pimp.

376
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:46,059
So, what's this guy Andre like?

377
00:28:47,023 --> 00:28:49,479
Most of the time, he's really nice.

378
00:28:49,609 --> 00:28:53,774
He has a pretty bad temper, though.
And he gets jealous real easy.

379
00:28:53,906 --> 00:28:56,113
He was in jail, too.

380
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:58,697
You're kidding me!

381
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:03,155
Who am l to criticiseWithout Andre,
l don't know where l'd be right now.

382
00:29:03,292 --> 00:29:05,331
l probably wouldn't even be alive.

383
00:29:10,258 --> 00:29:12,298
That's him.

384
00:29:13,678 --> 00:29:15,885
- Hello.
- Hello, yourself!

385
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:25,682
Well, l'll be seeing you.

386
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:30,486
- lf he ever hurts you...
- AndreHe would never hurt me.

387
00:29:31,991 --> 00:29:35,490
Niki, you don't understand men like
him. Prison is a really tough place.

388
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,289
lt was a minimum security prison.

389
00:29:38,414 --> 00:29:39,529
Well, still...

390
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:41,825
l should go.
l don't want to get him upset.

391
00:29:46,298 --> 00:29:48,505
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

392
00:30:47,576 --> 00:30:49,569
Good night, Daddy.

393
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,380
Good night, Nicole.

394
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:09,680
He's totally taking advantage of her.
She's only 16 years old.

395
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:12,846
l can't believe that guy tells people
she's his daughter.

396
00:31:12,979 --> 00:31:17,393
l know. She's terrified of him.
She says she isn't, but she is.

397
00:31:17,526 --> 00:31:20,148
That's going to be the easiest score
you'll ever have.

398
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,690
What do you mean?

399
00:31:21,823 --> 00:31:25,157
She's not like going out with
one of the staff girls here.

400
00:31:25,285 --> 00:31:29,366
lf she sleeps with a guy that age,
she'll fall for a guy like you, easy.

401
00:31:29,498 --> 00:31:30,957
You think so?

402
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:34,499
Trust me. This girl's experienced.
She expects that from a guy.

403
00:31:34,629 --> 00:31:36,669
Hi!

404
00:31:38,675 --> 00:31:40,964
l would like to go water skiing
with my daughter.

405
00:31:41,094 --> 00:31:42,340
- Right.
- Sure!

406
00:31:42,471 --> 00:31:45,009
- This is Nicole, my daughter.
- Niki.

407
00:31:45,141 --> 00:31:46,884
- Say hello to...?
- Ben.

408
00:31:47,018 --> 00:31:48,845
- Hi.
- l'm Tom.

409
00:31:48,978 --> 00:31:50,686
Hi, Tom.

410
00:31:53,233 --> 00:31:55,273
Did you have any problems
about last night?

411
00:31:55,402 --> 00:31:57,027
No, he didn't even notice l was gone.

412
00:31:57,154 --> 00:31:59,194
Let me help you.

413
00:32:01,034 --> 00:32:03,073
Give me that!

414
00:32:03,203 --> 00:32:05,990
l know what you were doing!
Come on, sweetheart.

415
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:17,461
Watch how l do it, Nicole.

416
00:32:21,432 --> 00:32:23,471
What are we waiting for?

417
00:32:23,768 --> 00:32:25,807
Go. Go!

418
00:32:37,366 --> 00:32:39,940
Wonderful! But maybe a little slower.

419
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:46,871
Watch out!
You're going to break his neck.

420
00:32:47,002 --> 00:32:51,047
- Would that be so bad?
- Slow down. The water is rough.

421
00:32:52,717 --> 00:32:54,757
l can fix that.

422
00:33:03,145 --> 00:33:05,850
Stop! Stop! Go back!

423
00:33:06,774 --> 00:33:08,732
Go back. Turn back. lt's too narrow.

424
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,319
Stop!

425
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:16,446
- Watch where you're going.
- l'm not going to hurt the bastard.

426
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,617
He's not a bastard.

427
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,621
Arrrrgh!

428
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,671
Andre, get down!

429
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:43,439
Are you crazySlow down.

430
00:33:44,817 --> 00:33:46,857
Watch out!

431
00:33:50,574 --> 00:33:52,614
Hey!

432
00:33:53,953 --> 00:33:56,242
l don't understand
what you see in that guy.

433
00:33:56,372 --> 00:33:59,159
What do you mean?
You don't know him at all.

434
00:33:59,292 --> 00:34:01,332
Aaaargh!

435
00:34:07,134 --> 00:34:10,385
What are you doingMy God, no!

436
00:34:10,513 --> 00:34:12,969
- He's not a dirty old man.
- Oh, yes, he is.

437
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:14,475
- No, he's not.
- He is, too.

438
00:34:15,352 --> 00:34:19,302
- Hey! Andy!
- Ride 'em, cowboy!

439
00:34:20,941 --> 00:34:24,311
Slow down!

440
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:27,104
- Mel'm judgemental?
- Yeah, you.

441
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,696
l'm just trying to show you
what's going on here.

442
00:34:29,826 --> 00:34:31,534
WhatWhat's going on here?

443
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,365
Oh, no!

444
00:34:42,549 --> 00:34:43,924
You idiot!

445
00:34:44,051 --> 00:34:46,090
Excuse me!

446
00:34:55,772 --> 00:34:58,098
He shouldn't be taking advantage
of a girl like you.

447
00:34:58,233 --> 00:35:02,362
He's not. And besides, l'm not
a girl. You don't understand.

448
00:35:02,613 --> 00:35:06,612
Slow down! Slow down!

449
00:35:07,118 --> 00:35:08,577
Slow down.

450
00:35:16,003 --> 00:35:17,664
Nice skiing there, Andy.

451
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,176
- That's not funny.
- You wanted me to slow down.

452
00:35:25,306 --> 00:35:27,512
Oh, my God, this is insane.

453
00:35:29,268 --> 00:35:31,475
What are you doing?

454
00:35:31,604 --> 00:35:33,644
Go!

455
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:36,557
Go! Go!

456
00:35:36,693 --> 00:35:38,567
Allez! Allez!

457
00:35:38,696 --> 00:35:41,187
Go! Go!

458
00:35:41,324 --> 00:35:43,530
You really are a child!
You know that?

459
00:36:10,899 --> 00:36:12,975
That was so stupid!

460
00:36:13,109 --> 00:36:15,980
- What did l do?
- Get a clue!

461
00:36:25,332 --> 00:36:27,787
- Are you OK?
- That boy is a menace.

462
00:36:27,918 --> 00:36:30,290
He should be fired!
What did l do to him?

463
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:33,588
No, Daddy, it's my fault. l wanted
to drive the boat. lt's my fault.

464
00:36:33,716 --> 00:36:36,005
Serves you right!

465
00:36:36,135 --> 00:36:38,175
lt's my fault. Are you OK?

466
00:36:38,638 --> 00:36:40,678
Come on!

467
00:36:41,642 --> 00:36:43,681
Go back to the island, boy

468
00:36:50,735 --> 00:36:52,645
Wake up early one mornin'

469
00:36:52,779 --> 00:36:54,855
Kiss my mama goodbye

470
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:58,240
Going back to the island
l'll see ya, Mama, don't cry

471
00:36:58,369 --> 00:37:01,572
- Tell me what's the matter.
- Nothing's the matter. Forget it.

472
00:37:01,706 --> 00:37:03,782
- Let's dance.
- l don't feel like it.

473
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:05,494
Come on. For me.

474
00:37:05,627 --> 00:37:07,501
l don't want to dance.

475
00:37:07,629 --> 00:37:09,669
Well, l'm going to dance.

476
00:37:12,718 --> 00:37:14,510
You look ridiculous.

477
00:37:15,388 --> 00:37:17,428
Then come and dance with me.

478
00:37:19,309 --> 00:37:22,145
- May l cut in?
- Of course.

479
00:37:24,273 --> 00:37:26,313
- Can l talk to you?
- No.

480
00:37:26,901 --> 00:37:30,816
- Can l talk to you outside?
- Don't be stupid. He'll see you.

481
00:37:49,051 --> 00:37:51,091
Thank you.

482
00:37:58,228 --> 00:38:02,855
- What's wrong with Niki tonight?
- Who knowsWhat does she want?

483
00:38:02,983 --> 00:38:04,775
lf she would only tell me.

484
00:38:04,902 --> 00:38:06,978
l'd do anything for her.

485
00:38:07,113 --> 00:38:10,862
She wants what every woman
from 14 to 90 wants.

486
00:38:10,992 --> 00:38:14,362
- What's that?
- A nice, beautiful romance.

487
00:38:14,496 --> 00:38:17,451
Romance?
What does she know about romance?

488
00:38:17,583 --> 00:38:20,917
She's only 14. She's a child.

489
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:23,878
l can't believe
that she's ready to...

490
00:38:24,883 --> 00:38:27,754
- No!
- l'm telling you.

491
00:38:27,886 --> 00:38:31,303
She's waiting for that first kiss
that'll only happen once.

492
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:35,268
- She is?
- All you can do is be there for her.

493
00:38:35,395 --> 00:38:37,352
lt might be
the greatest kiss in history.

494
00:38:38,231 --> 00:38:39,939
And it might be a total blowout.

495
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:42,605
ln fact,
it'll probably be a little of both.

496
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:47,149
And the only thing you can do
is be there when she needs you.

497
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:52,118
- And l thought you were a cynic.
- lt's after six. l'm off-duty.

498
00:38:52,915 --> 00:38:55,370
l promised myself l wouldn't do this,
but here goes.

499
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:59,369
There is one of these tropical
island dances on Thursday night.

500
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:03,753
Would you be interested?
No pressures, no expectations.

501
00:39:03,885 --> 00:39:06,174
- No penalty for early withdrawal.
- Huh?

502
00:39:06,305 --> 00:39:08,428
Nothing! Would you like to go?

503
00:39:10,393 --> 00:39:11,638
Yes.

504
00:39:11,769 --> 00:39:13,050
- Yes?
- OK.

505
00:39:13,187 --> 00:39:14,433
OK!

506
00:39:14,606 --> 00:39:17,524
Ever since l left her

507
00:39:18,777 --> 00:39:22,822
Nothing has been the same

508
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:27,866
l think l'll go and find her

509
00:39:27,996 --> 00:39:33,833
l'm going back
to give her my name...

510
00:39:33,961 --> 00:39:36,167
- May l?
- As long as l get him back.

511
00:39:36,297 --> 00:39:38,622
So many nights l sit here

512
00:39:39,384 --> 00:39:42,800
With memories by the score

513
00:39:42,929 --> 00:39:46,096
You were right with Diana.
She's not so bad.

514
00:39:46,725 --> 00:39:50,011
Thinking of the days l spent

515
00:39:50,146 --> 00:39:55,223
With the girl l still adore

516
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:00,699
Yes, l'm going back to see her

517
00:40:00,824 --> 00:40:06,246
Before my days are done

518
00:40:06,998 --> 00:40:10,498
Going back to see her

519
00:40:10,627 --> 00:40:13,878
ln the land

520
00:40:14,006 --> 00:40:19,677
Of the sea and sun?

521
00:40:22,557 --> 00:40:23,968
lsabel?

522
00:40:24,101 --> 00:40:25,975
Where are you?

523
00:40:26,103 --> 00:40:30,481
l'm calling you now. l'm here for
you. You say l'm not there for you.

524
00:40:30,608 --> 00:40:35,769
I am here. Where are you?
You are not there. I am here.

525
00:40:42,204 --> 00:40:45,206
l'm having an affair
with my phone machine.

526
00:40:48,628 --> 00:40:52,247
Hey, Andy! So, are you going
to perform for us tonight?

527
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:55,503
- lt's talent night.
- We've all got something prepared.

528
00:40:55,636 --> 00:40:57,759
Mike and l are doing
Streetcar Named Desire.

529
00:40:57,889 --> 00:40:59,929
l can't wait.

530
00:41:04,897 --> 00:41:06,688
l've been trying to reach lsabel,

531
00:41:06,815 --> 00:41:09,603
but she's out of town
or she won't answer the phone.

532
00:41:10,737 --> 00:41:12,895
She's playing you for a fool.

533
00:41:13,031 --> 00:41:15,653
- Why would she do that?
- Because she wants to marry you.

534
00:41:15,784 --> 00:41:18,240
No.

535
00:41:19,496 --> 00:41:20,907
You think so?

536
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,990
You're so naive.
She's got you eating out of her hand.

537
00:41:25,128 --> 00:41:27,702
No, she's not like that.
She's a wonderful person.

538
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,298
You told me.

539
00:41:29,424 --> 00:41:31,750
Yes, you'd like her very much.
l can tell.

540
00:41:31,885 --> 00:41:34,459
You'd get along like a car on fire.

541
00:41:35,181 --> 00:41:37,553
- A house.
- What?

542
00:41:38,518 --> 00:41:41,188
The expression is
"like a house on fire".

543
00:41:41,313 --> 00:41:43,104
A house, a car...

544
00:41:44,817 --> 00:41:48,566
- Do you love her?
- That's a very difficult question.

545
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:51,485
Do you love her?

546
00:41:53,326 --> 00:41:55,782
Yes. Yes. l do. l think so.

547
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:58,289
You're going to marry her.

548
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,623
That's always a possibility.

549
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:05,667
No, it's not a possibility.
lt's a definite.

550
00:42:05,799 --> 00:42:08,966
You'll marry her and you'll have
other kids, won't you?

551
00:42:09,803 --> 00:42:11,843
l don't know. Maybe.

552
00:42:13,641 --> 00:42:16,049
Wouldn't you like a little brother
or a sister?

553
00:42:18,521 --> 00:42:21,013
l'm really tired
and l have a headache.

554
00:42:21,858 --> 00:42:25,987
- You won't stay for the show?
- No. Thank you for dinner.

555
00:42:28,157 --> 00:42:30,483
l'm really happy for you.

556
00:43:38,403 --> 00:43:41,155
- Yes?
- Niki, what's the matter?

557
00:43:41,281 --> 00:43:43,321
- Who is this, Ben?
- lt's OK, Mom. l got it.

558
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:44,450
What's wrong?

559
00:43:44,577 --> 00:43:47,329
- l hate him. He's a horrible man.
- What'd he do to you?

560
00:43:49,415 --> 00:43:51,076
Stella.

561
00:43:51,209 --> 00:43:55,254
Stella! Stella!!!

562
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,718
So the sailor says to the man,
"Who knows?"

563
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:04,135
What's the matter?
WhatDo l owe you money?

564
00:44:04,265 --> 00:44:08,394
The highlight was Mrs Fitzsimmons
doing a duet with her false teeth.

565
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,847
l told Nicole
that l might marry lsabel.

566
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,522
- Did you tell lsabel yet?
- l can't find her.

567
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:20,238
Forget about all that for now.
Loosen up a little. Play something.

568
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:24,199
- No, no. Diana, please.
- Niki says you're a great on piano.

569
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:26,453
Andre would like to play.

570
00:44:26,582 --> 00:44:30,581
- l don't practise enough.
- Give him some encouragement.

571
00:44:30,712 --> 00:44:32,669
- This oughta be good.
- Yeah.

572
00:44:32,798 --> 00:44:35,669
- Stop it.
- Give the guy a break.

573
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:39,346
So, what do you want me to play?

574
00:44:39,472 --> 00:44:42,010
With someone your own age.

575
00:44:42,142 --> 00:44:45,926
- Play something French.
- Jacques Brel.

576
00:44:46,063 --> 00:44:50,108
Ah, Jacques Brel. Something French,
something French...

577
00:44:50,234 --> 00:44:52,393
lt could be...

578
00:44:53,279 --> 00:44:57,408
Each time l see a little girl
Of five or six or seven

579
00:44:57,534 --> 00:45:01,283
l can't resist a joyous urge
to smile and say

580
00:45:01,997 --> 00:45:05,948
Thank heaven for little girls

581
00:45:06,961 --> 00:45:10,128
For little girls

582
00:45:10,257 --> 00:45:11,834
That's it!

583
00:45:11,967 --> 00:45:15,835
Thank heaven for little girls

584
00:45:16,889 --> 00:45:20,175
They grow up
in the most delightful way

585
00:45:21,686 --> 00:45:26,064
Those little eyes
so helpless and appealing

586
00:45:26,191 --> 00:45:30,569
Will one day flash and send you
crashing through the ceiling

587
00:45:31,948 --> 00:45:34,866
Thank heaven for little girls

588
00:45:34,993 --> 00:45:36,784

Thank heaven for them all,
No matter where, no matter who

590
00:45:41,458 --> 00:45:44,994

00:45:46,381 --> 00:45:48,623
Thank heaven

592
00:45:48,758 --> 00:45:50,798

00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:11,649
Nicole?

596
00:46:18,959 --> 00:46:20,999

624
00:47:58,613 --> 00:48:00,357
- How?
- He just would.

625
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:04,073
You don't understand what he's like
when he sets his mind to something.

626
00:48:04,203 --> 00:48:06,242
Come here.

627
00:48:10,168 --> 00:48:13,454
That's my father's boat.
We'll take it and we'll go hide out.

628

- You don't love me any more!
- How can you say that?

665
00:50:08,217 --> 00:50:09,760
lt's true, you don't.

666
00:50:09,886 --> 00:50:12,258
You're going to marry lsabel
and live with her.

667
00:50:12,389 --> 00:50:14,927
You'll have other kids
and you won't need me.

00:50:15,058 --> 00:50:17,135
- l will always need you.
- No, you won't.

669
00:50:17,269 --> 00:50:19,262
lt'll be like the last five years,

670
00:50:19,438 --> 00:50:20,981
l won't be your daughter any more.

671
00:50:21,107 --> 00:50:23,859
You'll just disappear again
and forget about me.

672
00:50:23,985 --> 00:50:26,477
When have l ever forgotten about you?
Tell me when.

673
00:50:26,613 --> 00:50:29,780
My thirteenth birthday.
You forgot about me then.

674
00:50:31,744 --> 00:50:34,414
You were in New York with her.
With lsabel.

675
00:50:34,539 --> 00:50:36,745
How did you know she was with me?

676
00:50:36,875 --> 00:50:39,081
You were supposed to come
to my birthday party.

677
00:50:39,211 --> 00:50:41,250
Mom said you couldn't
'cause you were sick.

678
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:44,915
l was worried about you,
so l made soup for you.

679
00:50:46,093 --> 00:50:48,133
A soup! Oh!

myself, but you weren't in your room,

682
00:50:54,311 --> 00:50:57,597
so l waited for you in the lobby
all afternoon.

683
00:50:57,732 --> 00:51:01,564
And then l saw you and her coming off
the elevator and you weren't sick.

684
00:51:01,694 --> 00:51:03,189

00:51:08,327 --> 00:51:10,154
You've never been there for me.

688
00:51:10,287 --> 00:51:13,242

and forget l existed.

689
00:51:13,374 --> 00:51:15,082
Oh, Nicole. Oh, God, Nicole.

So it's genetic. ls that it?

00:53:54,139 --> 00:53:55,218

Besides, if l tell him

739
00:54:24,173 --> 00:54:25,797
He'll think l'm some kind of liar.

But l don't know what to tell him.

754
00:55:23,406 --> 00:55:25,944
Whatever you do,
don't tell him the truth.

755
00:55:26,076 --> 00:55:28,448
Please, Daddy.

756
00:55:30,122 --> 00:55:32,281

Good. lt's you l want to talk to.

761
00:55:46,098 --> 00:55:49,135
Let's get something straight.
You don't scare me.

762
00:55:49,269 --> 00:55:51,641
Too bad. Would you like a drink?

763
00:55:51,771 --> 00:55:53,848
- No, thank you.
- l will, if you don't mind.

764
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,477
You really make me sick.

765
00:55:57,611 --> 00:56:00,363
l feel a little nauseous myself
right now.

766
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:03,989
l mean, look at yourself.
You're old enough to be her father.

767
00:56:06,204 --> 00:56:08,244
The truth is cruel.

768
00:56:08,373 --> 00:56:10,165
ls that what you came to tell me?

769
00:56:10,292 --> 00:56:12,332
l came to tell you
she's leaving you.

770
00:56:12,461 --> 00:56:14,703
And where is she going?

771
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:16,713
She's going to stay at my house.

772
00:56:16,841 --> 00:56:19,759
My parents said it's OK. Then
she's gonna go back to New York,

773
00:56:19,886 --> 00:56:23,338
and we're gonna find her a place
to live until she finishes school.

774
00:56:23,474 --> 00:56:24,754
What about her parents?

775
00:56:24,892 --> 00:56:29,056
She told me her father's doing time
for armed robbery.

776
00:56:29,189 --> 00:56:32,475
Uh, right. l keep forgetting that.

777
00:56:34,236 --> 00:56:36,359
- And her mother?
- She's a prostitute.

778
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:40,445
- l bet she ran away with her pimp.
- Yeah. She told you?

779
00:56:40,576 --> 00:56:42,653
Wild guess.

780
00:56:42,787 --> 00:56:45,788
lt's gonna be tough, but l'll be
there to help her through it.

781
00:56:47,376 --> 00:56:50,294
- How do l fit in?
- You don't. She's finished with you.

782
00:56:50,421 --> 00:56:52,627
Oh. You drive a hard bargain.

783
00:56:54,384 --> 00:56:56,792
What makes you think
l'm going to give her up?

784
00:56:56,928 --> 00:56:59,051
From what she's told me about you,

785
00:56:59,181 --> 00:57:02,515
in spite of everything, deep down,
she thinks you're an OK guy.

786
00:57:02,768 --> 00:57:06,220
- l'm touched.
- ln your own way you love her.

787
00:57:07,231 --> 00:57:09,770
Yes, l do.
ln my own way, very much so.

788
00:57:12,654 --> 00:57:15,572
But what about youDo you love her?

789
00:57:16,367 --> 00:57:18,407
ln your own way, of course?

790
00:57:21,289 --> 00:57:23,329
Yes, l do.

791
00:57:23,458 --> 00:57:26,993
l want to take care of her. Make
sure nothing else bad happens to her.

792
00:57:28,839 --> 00:57:31,330
What does Nicole think about
these plans of yours?

793
00:57:33,636 --> 00:57:39,260
- l haven't discussed them with her.
- NoWell, l suggest you do.

794
00:57:39,393 --> 00:57:41,432
After all, she has a say in this.

795
00:57:42,897 --> 00:57:44,272
Well, yeah, l know that.

796
00:57:44,398 --> 00:57:47,565
Good. Then, wait here.
She should be back soon.

797
00:57:47,694 --> 00:57:52,072
l'll go along with whatever
she decides. l'm going for a swim.

798
00:58:08,259 --> 00:58:10,584
Good to see you. How's it going?

799
00:58:19,521 --> 00:58:22,641
Thanks a lot. l was stuck
in that closet for half an hour.

800
00:58:22,775 --> 00:58:24,934
He finally went out
and l pretended to come in.

801
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:27,311
Ah. How did it go?

802
00:58:27,447 --> 00:58:30,117
He's impressed by you.
He thinks you're a great guy.

803
00:58:30,242 --> 00:58:32,947
- What a relief!
- l told him l'm staying with you.

804
00:58:34,038 --> 00:58:35,117
lsn't he jealous?

805
00:58:35,247 --> 00:58:37,324
l told him
there's nothing to be jealous of.

806
00:58:37,458 --> 00:58:41,408
That there's nothing between us
any more because of...

807
00:58:41,546 --> 00:58:44,298
Promise you won't get mad?

808
00:58:44,424 --> 00:58:46,916
Why do l get so frightened
every time you ask me that?

809
00:58:47,052 --> 00:58:49,010
Because of your heart.

810
00:58:49,138 --> 00:58:51,178
My heartWhat about my heart?

811
00:58:51,307 --> 00:58:54,261
- l told him you were dying.
- l'm dying now?

812
00:58:54,394 --> 00:58:58,606
Daddy! l told him l had to stay
with you for your final days.

813
00:58:58,732 --> 00:59:01,354
My final days?
What's the matter with you?

814
00:59:01,485 --> 00:59:05,566
When l start lying, l can't stop.
lt's kind of addictive.

815
00:59:05,698 --> 00:59:09,743
- What am l dying of?
- A disease you caught in Africa.

816
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:13,239
- When was l in Africa?
- During the Hundred Years War.

817
00:59:13,374 --> 00:59:16,992
The Hundred Years War
was in the Middle Ages, in Europe.

818
00:59:18,713 --> 00:59:20,338
He didn't seem to notice.

819
00:59:20,465 --> 00:59:22,505
Why not the Crusades?

820
00:59:35,941 --> 00:59:39,773
You think l'm stupid. Why didn't you
tell me you wanted to stay with him,

821
00:59:39,904 --> 00:59:42,193
instead of making up some stupid lie?

822
00:59:42,323 --> 00:59:44,861
- What are you talking about?
- Andre is not sick.

823
00:59:45,034 --> 00:59:46,445
He is, too, sick.

824
00:59:46,578 --> 00:59:49,864
Then how come he's out there
riding a jet ski like some crazy man?

825
00:59:51,625 --> 00:59:55,077
- You don't understand anything.
- What don't l understand?

826
00:59:55,212 --> 00:59:57,039
That's how his disease works.

827
00:59:57,173 --> 00:59:58,371
One day he's healthy.

828
00:59:58,508 --> 01:00:02,043
The next, he's like a limp doll,
lying around the house drooling.

829
01:00:02,179 --> 01:00:05,299
Last night, he...
Last night, he... he...

830
01:00:05,432 --> 01:00:07,342
He what?

831
01:00:07,476 --> 01:00:09,968
He fell asleep in the tub
and almost drowned.

832
01:00:10,104 --> 01:00:12,144
Sometimes you really are a child.

833
01:00:14,109 --> 01:00:16,149
Slump down a little more.

834
01:00:17,112 --> 01:00:19,235
- Like this?
- More.

835
01:00:21,325 --> 01:00:22,950
OK, now lean over.

836
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:24,655
Better.

837
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:26,994
Can you believe he called me a liar?

838
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,163
Oh, the nerve!

839
01:00:29,293 --> 01:00:33,338
- You don't look sick enough.
- l feel sick, believe me.

840
01:00:33,464 --> 01:00:35,836
- Oh, what's that?
- Sweat. You have a fever.

841
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:39,383
Stop. You're soaking me.
How long must l do this?

842
01:00:39,512 --> 01:00:43,096
- Not much longer, Daddy. Please.
- Niki?

843
01:00:45,394 --> 01:00:47,885
Don't overdo it.
Remember, you're a tough guy.

844
01:00:48,022 --> 01:00:49,849
Yeah, l'm a tough guy.

845
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:51,900
- Hi.
- Hi.

846
01:00:52,026 --> 01:00:53,189
Hello.

847
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:56,487
- Aren't you feeling well?
- Fine. Argh!

848
01:00:56,615 --> 01:00:59,782
- What is it?
- Nothing. Let's go.

849
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:02,199
Just an old war wound.

850
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:04,655
- A war wound?
- A piece of shrapnel.

851
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:07,329
From a landmine
planted by revolutionaries.

852
01:01:07,461 --> 01:01:12,538
Blew a hole in my intestine
the size of a grapefruit.

853
01:01:16,638 --> 01:01:22,474
lt really hurt. A witch doctor
treated me. The wound never healed.

854
01:01:24,396 --> 01:01:27,563
Those were the days.
Memories, memories!

855
01:01:28,276 --> 01:01:30,518
- Let's go.
- Well, wait, wait, wait.

856
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:33,026
l feel terrible
just leaving you here like this.

857
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:35,482
Maybe we should stay
and have dinner together.

858
01:01:35,617 --> 01:01:36,993
- Oh, yes.
- No!

859
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:40,571
No, no.
No, l already ordered some broth.

860
01:01:40,706 --> 01:01:44,407
l eat that, throw up
and watch some TV. No, you go.

861
01:01:45,378 --> 01:01:48,333
You two go, have fun.
Don't worry about me.

862
01:02:04,441 --> 01:02:08,487
l feel so bad for him, laying there
all by himself in that little room.

863
01:02:08,613 --> 01:02:12,563
- He likes it like that.
- He's had an amazing life.

864
01:02:12,701 --> 01:02:15,655
Yeah, it's more amazing
every day.

865
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:21,491
lsabel, l've been thinking
about what you said.

866
01:02:21,627 --> 01:02:24,333
But l have been distracted by things
here.

867
01:02:24,464 --> 01:02:26,706
Nicole thinks
she's in love with a boy.

868
01:02:27,926 --> 01:02:30,382
A nice boy.

869
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:33,798
l feel like smashing his head against
the wall every time l see him,

870
01:02:33,933 --> 01:02:36,305
but he's a very nice boy.

871
01:02:37,562 --> 01:02:41,940
She's made up some ridiculous story
which, oh no, I can't explain it now.

872
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:46,811
I wish you would answer the phone.
I need your advice.

873
01:02:48,449 --> 01:02:50,738
Isabel, do you hear me?

874
01:02:51,995 --> 01:02:54,533
I need you.

875
01:03:11,475 --> 01:03:16,434
- Niki said you weren't feeling well.
- l'm dying! Didn't she tell you?

876
01:03:16,564 --> 01:03:19,138
l'm sorry.
l thought we were going to the dance.

877
01:03:19,276 --> 01:03:21,269
l waited for you,
but you never showed up.

878
01:03:21,403 --> 01:03:24,191
l wasn't there for you either.
ls that what you're saying?

879
01:03:24,323 --> 01:03:25,866
What?

880
01:03:25,992 --> 01:03:29,942
l'm not there for Nicole, for lsabel,
for you, l am never there!

881
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:34,078
Wherever l am, l am never there!
Where l am?

882
01:03:34,793 --> 01:03:39,539
What l am doing so wrongl wish
all of you would leave me alone.

883
01:03:42,469 --> 01:03:43,469
Diana!

884
01:03:44,346 --> 01:03:46,303
Diana! Diana!

885
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:49,302
Diana, wait! Diana, please wait.

886
01:03:52,146 --> 01:03:53,178
Diana!

887
01:03:53,314 --> 01:03:56,315
So this is what he does for exercise.

888
01:03:57,277 --> 01:03:58,771
Wait! Let me explain, Diana.

889
01:03:58,904 --> 01:04:00,184
Oh, merde!

890
01:04:01,824 --> 01:04:03,864
There is a God!

891
01:04:05,703 --> 01:04:07,743
You look so funny.

892
01:04:11,835 --> 01:04:13,875
Animal!

893
01:04:14,004 --> 01:04:17,005
Look how they stare at me!
The pariah.

894
01:04:17,133 --> 01:04:19,920
They should know what a good father
you've been to Niki.

895
01:04:20,053 --> 01:04:22,046
- You think l am?
- Yes, l do.

896
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:25,181
Oh, that's good to hear.
Sometimes l am not sure.

897
01:04:26,769 --> 01:04:30,897
l don't know if a good father would
keep up the lie for his daughter.

898
01:04:32,525 --> 01:04:36,144
No, l can't pretend any more.
l'm going to tell him the truth.

899
01:04:36,279 --> 01:04:40,278
The KGB was on our tail.
We were doomed, for sure.

900
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:43,196
The railroad
was our only chance of escape.

901
01:04:43,329 --> 01:04:47,956
Our train was sliding down the icy
tracks of the Ural mountains.

902
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:51,454
Suddenly,
in front of us was a boulder.

903
01:04:51,588 --> 01:04:55,800
- And the engineer swerved.
- Trains don't swerve.

904
01:04:55,926 --> 01:04:58,928
l wish
someone had told the engineer that.

905
01:04:59,055 --> 01:05:02,259
- Hi.
- Ben came to see how l was feeling.

906
01:05:02,392 --> 01:05:04,634
- lsn't it nice of him?
- Charming.

907
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:07,854
Andre was telling me about his
years in Russia. Unbelievable!

908
01:05:07,982 --> 01:05:09,559
Yeah, they are.

909
01:05:09,692 --> 01:05:13,026
Sweetheart, would you mind
getting us a couple of beers?

910
01:05:16,074 --> 01:05:19,408
Did l tell you about the time l swam
in the Yangtze with Chairman Mao?

911
01:05:20,746 --> 01:05:22,656
No, but Niki mentioned Mount Everest.

912
01:05:22,790 --> 01:05:25,460
Everest!

913
01:05:25,585 --> 01:05:28,503
- Well, you could say thanks.
- Thanks.

914
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:31,086
They were
in the middle of Cultural Revolution.

915
01:05:31,216 --> 01:05:34,467
The Gang of Four
was storming the lmperial Palace.

916
01:05:36,264 --> 01:05:39,300
You think l'm stupid. You think
l don't know what you're doing.

917
01:05:39,434 --> 01:05:40,513
What am l doing?

918
01:05:40,643 --> 01:05:42,969
Making him insecure,
that's what you're doing.

919
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:46,439
He can't compete with this legend.
You're doing it on purpose.

920
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:48,476
l'm doing it for you, remember.

921
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:51,185
No.
You're manipulating this whole thing.

922
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:55,071
You're taking his interest away,
just like every other father.

923
01:05:55,202 --> 01:05:57,657
And you think you're so clever.

924
01:06:00,374 --> 01:06:01,868
This was your idea.

925
01:06:02,001 --> 01:06:05,335
He asked me about my life in prison.
What am l supposed to do?

926
01:06:05,463 --> 01:06:08,001
What about that crap
about Saigon and Mao?

927
01:06:08,133 --> 01:06:11,633
He's totally intimidated by you.
Before your stories, he was romantic.

928
01:06:11,762 --> 01:06:14,218
Now, he's just,
"Andre this, Andre that."

929
01:06:15,016 --> 01:06:19,180
- l don't know what to do.
- Tell him the truth.

930
01:06:19,312 --> 01:06:21,768
lt's too late. l can't.
He'll hate me.

931
01:06:21,898 --> 01:06:24,437
No, sweetheart,
he won't hate you. No.

932
01:06:25,861 --> 01:06:29,811
- There is something you could do.
- Oh, no. What?

933
01:06:29,949 --> 01:06:33,650
Make a fool of yourself in front
of him, so he'll feel more secure.

934
01:06:38,667 --> 01:06:40,707
OK, l'll play you two.

935
01:07:35,314 --> 01:07:37,391
- Are you ready?
- All right.

936
01:07:46,744 --> 01:07:48,784
That was so funny, wasn't it?

937
01:07:48,913 --> 01:07:52,413
l can't believe he almost hit himself
on the head with a golf ball.

938
01:07:52,542 --> 01:07:53,740
Yeah, he's a real riot.

939
01:07:53,877 --> 01:07:56,582
At least l found some things
l can do better than him.

940
01:07:56,714 --> 01:08:00,297
l'll bet there are a lot of things
you could do better than him.

941
01:08:00,426 --> 01:08:02,668
l can't believe
you have to leave so soon.

942
01:08:03,555 --> 01:08:05,844
Who are you gonna miss more?
Me or Andre?

943
01:08:07,935 --> 01:08:09,927
You, of course.

944
01:08:14,233 --> 01:08:16,606
- What's wrong?
- That's him.

945
01:08:42,265 --> 01:08:44,935
Oh, great! He plays the piano, too?

946
01:08:46,061 --> 01:08:47,804
He studied at the Paris Conservatory.

947
01:08:47,938 --> 01:08:50,227
He used to play this
to put me to sleep.

948
01:09:11,298 --> 01:09:13,871
l wish you could hear him
play Schubert. He...

949
01:09:28,192 --> 01:09:31,110
"Dear Niki,
lt's obvious you love Andre.

950
01:09:31,237 --> 01:09:33,942
l've felt it
ever since the beginning of all this,

951
01:09:34,073 --> 01:09:37,407
but l never understood it
until l saw you watching him tonight.

952
01:09:37,536 --> 01:09:41,035
l think it would be better
if l didn't see you ever again.

953
01:09:41,165 --> 01:09:43,537
Or at least until Andre is dead."

954
01:09:43,667 --> 01:09:47,037
Oh, no. No. Don't even think
of asking me to do that. No.

955
01:09:49,090 --> 01:09:51,130
Oh!

956
01:09:53,136 --> 01:09:55,379
Don't cry. Don't cry.

957
01:09:55,514 --> 01:09:57,756
Maybe it's time
to tell him the truth.

958
01:09:57,892 --> 01:09:59,932
No, l can't.

959
01:10:09,989 --> 01:10:12,029
You want to go swimming?

960
01:10:14,244 --> 01:10:16,283
Want to go sailing?

961
01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:33,054
- NASDAQ took a plunge yesterday.
- Oh.

962
01:10:34,183 --> 01:10:36,756
With interest rates low
and the bond market pressured,

963
01:10:36,894 --> 01:10:38,519
things are going to get exciting.

964
01:10:38,646 --> 01:10:41,434
Would you do me a favour, please?
Shut up.

965
01:10:41,566 --> 01:10:43,144
l can do that.

966
01:10:43,318 --> 01:10:44,516
Niki in trouble!

967
01:10:44,653 --> 01:10:47,061
WhatWhat kind of trouble?

968
01:10:50,451 --> 01:10:52,824
She took a windsurfer
out by the reefs, man.

969
01:10:52,954 --> 01:10:54,698
Why did you let her?

970
01:10:54,831 --> 01:10:57,749
She ain't want to listen to us.
Now she can't get back.

971
01:10:57,876 --> 01:10:59,916
Help!

972
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:02,245
Where is the boat?

973
01:11:02,381 --> 01:11:05,169
Ben's working on her.
He has the engine all pulled apart.

974
01:11:06,302 --> 01:11:08,342
Help!

975
01:11:12,392 --> 01:11:14,432
Don't worry! l'm coming.

976
01:11:14,562 --> 01:11:16,969
Be careful, man.
There's a strong current there.

977
01:11:22,529 --> 01:11:25,483
- What's wrong, man?
- lt won't start. Keep trying.

978
01:11:31,539 --> 01:11:33,579
Help! Help!

979
01:12:13,712 --> 01:12:15,751
Let's go.

980
01:12:29,479 --> 01:12:31,057
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

981
01:12:31,190 --> 01:12:33,182
What the hell were you doing?

982
01:12:33,317 --> 01:12:35,144
- Where's Andre?
- What about him?

983
01:12:35,278 --> 01:12:38,398
He swam out to get you.
- Well, where is he?

984
01:12:41,284 --> 01:12:45,117
- Over there.
- You see himWhere?

985
01:12:45,247 --> 01:12:46,492
There he is!

986
01:12:50,128 --> 01:12:52,204
- He's going under.
- What do you mean?

987
01:12:52,338 --> 01:12:54,545
Do something! Do something!

988
01:12:54,674 --> 01:12:57,344
Daddy! Daddy!

989
01:12:57,469 --> 01:12:59,842
He's drowning. Hurry!

990
01:13:31,633 --> 01:13:34,420
l'm so sorry, Daddy. lt's all
my fault. l'm so sorry.

991
01:13:53,866 --> 01:13:55,277
Daddy, l'm so sorry.

992
01:13:55,410 --> 01:13:57,237
l'm so sorry, Daddy.

993
01:13:57,579 --> 01:14:00,035
Scuzati me. l am a doctor.

994
01:14:06,672 --> 01:14:08,712
Je t'aime, papa cherie. Je t'aime.

995
01:14:10,885 --> 01:14:12,296
Cherie.

996
01:14:12,429 --> 01:14:15,679
- ls he gonna be all right?
- He is going to be fine.

997
01:14:16,725 --> 01:14:18,599
Take him inside, out of the sun.

998
01:14:30,741 --> 01:14:33,742
Excuse me,
are you by any chance ltalian?

999
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:36,539
Yes, l am. Alberto Lenzi.

1000
01:14:36,664 --> 01:14:40,034
ltalian and a doctor?
Oh, be still, my heart!

1001
01:14:40,168 --> 01:14:42,042
- Are you all right?
- Never felt better.

1002
01:14:42,171 --> 01:14:43,748
l'm Diana Blaine.

1003
01:14:43,881 --> 01:14:47,416
- Alberto... May l call you Alberto?
- Sure.

1004
01:14:47,552 --> 01:14:51,384
- Are you here alone?
- Yes. l'm getting over a divorce.

1005
01:14:51,514 --> 01:14:53,721
Oh, what a shame!

1006
01:15:14,415 --> 01:15:17,085
Ben, l've been looking for you
all afternoon.

1007
01:15:17,878 --> 01:15:22,955
l'm sorry. l didn't mean for things
to get so out of hand.

1008
01:15:23,968 --> 01:15:25,343
Ben, just talk to me.

1009
01:15:25,469 --> 01:15:28,755
l want you to stay away from me.
You and your daddy.

1010
01:15:28,890 --> 01:15:31,049
Both of you. l mean it.

1011
01:15:34,563 --> 01:15:35,844
This is a waste of time.

1012
01:15:35,981 --> 01:15:38,389
No, it's not a waste of time.
Believe me, l'm a man.

1013
01:15:38,526 --> 01:15:41,444
l know what getting a love letter
from a girl does to me.

1014
01:15:41,571 --> 01:15:43,445
Now, where were we?

1015
01:15:43,573 --> 01:15:48,817
"Even if you decide not to forgive
me, know l will never forget you."

1016
01:15:48,954 --> 01:15:50,912
No. lt's so corny.

1017
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:53,578
lt's a love letter.
lt's supposed to be corny.

1018
01:15:53,710 --> 01:15:56,830
What do you want it to say?
To whom it may concern?

1019
01:15:56,963 --> 01:15:58,292
OK, go on.

1020
01:15:58,423 --> 01:16:00,167
OK, now we end it.

1021
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:01,676
"Love always."

1022
01:16:01,802 --> 01:16:03,842
Love always?

1023
01:16:03,971 --> 01:16:06,011
What's wrong with that?

1024
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:09,058
Nothing. lt's perfect.
"Love always, Nicole."

1025
01:16:09,185 --> 01:16:11,309
- Niki.
- Niki, if you want. OK.

1026
01:16:11,438 --> 01:16:14,807
- OK, let me read it over.
- No, no, no, it's finished.

1027
01:16:14,942 --> 01:16:18,643
Everything will be fine.
You will see. l promise. Hm?

1028
01:16:25,370 --> 01:16:27,410
Come here.

1029
01:16:29,166 --> 01:16:32,167
- This is so humiliating.
- You'll thank me for this.

1030
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:41,134
Anybody out there?

1031
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:46,008
Be quiet, Rocky.
There's nobody there.

1032
01:16:46,144 --> 01:16:48,386
Come on. Come on, boy.

1033
01:16:49,731 --> 01:16:51,771
Come on.

1034
01:16:57,365 --> 01:17:00,401
- Which one is his room?
- That one, with the light on.

1035
01:17:01,077 --> 01:17:02,620
l must be crazy.

1036
01:17:08,627 --> 01:17:12,412
Oh, Daddy, gosh!
What are you doing?

1037
01:17:14,801 --> 01:17:16,841
Who's there?

1038
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:23,094
He's reading it.

1039
01:17:26,856 --> 01:17:28,054
Niki?

1040
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:30,682
- Allez. go on.
- No, don't push me.

1041
01:17:32,905 --> 01:17:36,191
- Niki, is that you?
- You got my letter?

1042
01:17:36,325 --> 01:17:38,448
Yeah.

1043
01:17:39,662 --> 01:17:43,079
l just wanted to say goodbye.
Well, goodbye.

1044
01:17:43,208 --> 01:17:45,664
- No, no, no no, no!
- Don't push me!

1045
01:17:45,794 --> 01:17:48,286
- Who are you talking to?
- No-one.

1046
01:17:48,422 --> 01:17:50,878
Your letter says you wanted to tell
me something. What?

1047
01:17:52,468 --> 01:17:56,052
- l can't really say it right now.
- Yes, you can. Tell him.

1048
01:17:56,181 --> 01:18:01,140
- Maybe we could meet at the dance.
- l'm not going. Tell me now.

1049
01:18:01,270 --> 01:18:03,144
Tell him you miss him.

1050
01:18:03,272 --> 01:18:04,387
l missed him.

1051
01:18:04,524 --> 01:18:07,193
You. l miss you. A lot.

1052
01:18:08,987 --> 01:18:11,229
WhyDidn't anybody else
believe your lies?

1053
01:18:11,365 --> 01:18:13,821
No, that's not it.

1054
01:18:13,951 --> 01:18:17,071
- Be more romantic.
- Thanks. How?

1055
01:18:18,373 --> 01:18:23,201
Tell him... When l look at your face,
it's the only time l'm really happy.

1056
01:18:24,004 --> 01:18:27,041
When l look at your face,
it's the only time l'm really happy.

1057
01:18:28,843 --> 01:18:30,337
- Your eyes.
- Your eyes.

1058
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:31,632
- Your hands.
- Your hands.

1059
01:18:31,763 --> 01:18:33,803
- Your smile.
The way you frown.

1060
01:18:33,932 --> 01:18:35,095
The way you frown.

1061
01:18:35,225 --> 01:18:39,009
- They make my heart soar.
- They make my heart soar.

1062
01:18:40,523 --> 01:18:43,477
- Why should l believe you?
- Because it's true, you idiot.

1063
01:18:43,609 --> 01:18:45,483
Because it's true, you idiot!

1064
01:18:46,446 --> 01:18:48,605
- How can he ask that?
- Sorry.

1065
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:52,988
- What next?
- l know l haven't been perfect.

1066
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,327
l know l haven't been perfect.

1067
01:18:55,456 --> 01:18:57,994
- But who is?
- But who is?

1068
01:18:58,126 --> 01:19:01,910
- Forgive me, please.
- Forgive me. Please.

1069
01:19:03,465 --> 01:19:05,007
Why should l?

1070
01:19:05,134 --> 01:19:07,839
Because l cannot imagine my world
without you in it.

1071
01:19:07,970 --> 01:19:12,300
Because... l cannot imagine my world
without you in it.

1072
01:19:13,393 --> 01:19:16,893
- And...
- And...

1073
01:19:17,022 --> 01:19:18,433
l love you.

1074
01:19:19,275 --> 01:19:21,149
l love you.

1075
01:19:25,031 --> 01:19:27,024
He's smiling. l think he's buying it.

1076
01:19:27,784 --> 01:19:29,576
Ah...

1077
01:19:32,206 --> 01:19:34,163
Maybe l'll see you
at the dance later.

1078
01:19:36,461 --> 01:19:38,418
OK. Later.

1079
01:19:44,929 --> 01:19:47,218
- Let's go.
- Do you think it worked?

1080
01:19:47,348 --> 01:19:49,388
Oh, we'll see, we'll see.

1081
01:19:54,690 --> 01:19:56,979
Where did you come up
with that stuff, anyway?

1082
01:19:57,109 --> 01:19:58,438
What stuff?

1083
01:19:58,569 --> 01:20:03,730
Your eyes, your hands, you make
my heart soar. lt was so lame.

1084
01:20:11,166 --> 01:20:12,661
Nicole, please.

1085
01:20:12,793 --> 01:20:14,833
l'm coming.

1086
01:20:20,218 --> 01:20:23,220
WellHow do l look?

1087
01:20:27,184 --> 01:20:31,930
- OK.
- ls that the best you can doOK?

1088
01:20:33,483 --> 01:20:36,734
Beautiful. Glorious. Enchanting.

1089
01:20:37,738 --> 01:20:39,565
That's better.

1090
01:20:39,740 --> 01:20:42,944
lsland boy, you know my heart
is still in the Caribbean

1091
01:20:43,578 --> 01:20:47,197
lsland boy,
l still hear my girlfriend say hey

1092
01:20:47,332 --> 01:20:51,662
Come back home
to the land of the balmy beaches

1093
01:20:51,796 --> 01:20:55,628
Where you heart has always been
since the very first day

1094
01:20:55,758 --> 01:20:59,922
l hear cowbells and the drums
on New Year's morning

1095
01:21:00,055 --> 01:21:04,302
And l smell hibiscus
in the tropic skies above

1096
01:21:04,435 --> 01:21:08,303
Look at the boats,
and the conchfish at dawning

1097
01:21:08,439 --> 01:21:10,231
l know that it's Nassau...

1098
01:21:10,358 --> 01:21:13,313
Bonsoir. Vous paraissez tres
constipee, ce soir.

1099
01:21:18,284 --> 01:21:21,071
- What did he say?
- Who cares?

1100
01:21:21,204 --> 01:21:23,410
Hey, hey, hey, Andy!

1101
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:25,248
We got a question for you.

1102
01:21:25,375 --> 01:21:27,831
OK, you're in France
and you want French toast.

1103
01:21:27,961 --> 01:21:30,453
Do you say toast,
or do you have to say French toast?

1104
01:21:30,589 --> 01:21:31,965
How would he know?

1105
01:21:32,091 --> 01:21:35,959
Me donnez votre addresse, parce que
si par malchance je vais a Scranton,

1106
01:21:36,096 --> 01:21:38,468
j'ai merais bein eviter votre rue.

1107
01:21:38,598 --> 01:21:41,350
Whoa! Vive la France!

1108
01:21:44,355 --> 01:21:46,514
Hey! Hi, guys. Hello, how are you?

1109
01:21:52,155 --> 01:21:54,528
Daddy, he's not... He's not here.

1110
01:21:54,658 --> 01:21:56,817
Give him time, darling.
Give him time.

1111
01:21:57,787 --> 01:22:00,076
But l'll die if l don't see him.

1112
01:22:00,206 --> 01:22:01,617
Andre, Niki, hi!

1113
01:22:01,749 --> 01:22:05,534
This is Gina. Her father's
an economics professor at Stanford.

1114
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:09,046
- lnternational finance.
- Nice to meet you, Gina.

1115
01:22:09,174 --> 01:22:12,674
- Pretty good, huh?
- Yeah, you make a perfect couple.

1116
01:22:12,804 --> 01:22:14,761
Go off and have boring children.

1117
01:22:35,704 --> 01:22:38,955
Many nights l sit here

1118
01:22:39,792 --> 01:22:43,873
- With memories by the score
- He's not coming.

1119
01:22:44,005 --> 01:22:46,045
Come on, let's dance, huh?

1120
01:22:46,633 --> 01:22:50,299
Thinking of the days l spent

1121
01:22:50,429 --> 01:22:55,222
With the girl l still adore

1122
01:22:55,352 --> 01:23:01,022
So l'm going back to see her...

1123
01:23:01,150 --> 01:23:05,065
- Daddy, what if he doesn't come?
- Then he doesn't deserve you.

1124
01:23:08,825 --> 01:23:10,865
You're the greatest, Daddy.

1125
01:23:10,994 --> 01:23:14,494
And you were right. This was
the best vacation l've ever had.

1126
01:23:15,541 --> 01:23:17,035
Me, too.

1127
01:23:17,168 --> 01:23:19,208
..and sun

1128
01:23:26,762 --> 01:23:30,381
Once l had a notion

1129
01:23:30,516 --> 01:23:35,428
About this Nassau girl

1130
01:23:35,564 --> 01:23:37,106
Daddy, he's here.

1131
01:23:37,232 --> 01:23:41,729
l put my thoughts in motion

1132
01:23:41,862 --> 01:23:46,359
And found my heart in a whirl

1133
01:23:46,492 --> 01:23:47,524
l see.

1134
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:51,362
So l'm going back to see her

1135
01:23:51,498 --> 01:23:52,779
Go on.

1136
01:23:52,916 --> 01:23:58,291
Before my days are done

1137
01:23:58,423 --> 01:24:01,958
Going back to see her

1138
01:24:02,093 --> 01:24:05,048
ln the land

1139
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:11,846
Of the sea and sun

1140
01:24:20,447 --> 01:24:24,113
Ever since l left her

1141
01:24:25,787 --> 01:24:29,737
Nothing has been the same

1142
01:24:31,084 --> 01:24:34,869
?l think l'll go and find her

1143
01:24:35,006 --> 01:24:40,463
l'm going back to give her my name

1144
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:46,307
Oh, many nights l sit here

1145
01:24:46,435 --> 01:24:51,311
With memories by the score

1146
01:24:53,151 --> 01:24:56,900
Thinking of the days l've spent

1147
01:24:57,030 --> 01:25:01,859
With the girl l still adore

1148
01:25:01,994 --> 01:25:07,072
Yes, l'm going back to see her

1149
01:25:07,918 --> 01:25:13,339
Before my days are done

1150
01:25:13,466 --> 01:25:17,678
Going back to see her

1151
01:25:17,804 --> 01:25:24,470
ln the land of the sea and sun

1152
01:25:25,312 --> 01:25:27,471
I don't know
if I'd call it a vacation,

1153
01:25:27,606 --> 01:25:30,561
but it was the most incredible
ten days in my life.

1154
01:25:31,486 --> 01:25:35,436
l think Nicole has taught me
more than l could ever teach her.

1155
01:25:35,574 --> 01:25:39,275
l have thought about what you said,
and l have made a decision.

1156
01:25:40,454 --> 01:25:43,456
I want to marry you.
That is, if you want to marry me.

1157
01:25:46,544 --> 01:25:47,825
Andre?

1158
01:25:47,963 --> 01:25:49,457
- Isabel?
- Yes.

1159
01:25:49,590 --> 01:25:54,715
l've been calling you every
day. Were you listening just now?

1160
01:25:55,555 --> 01:25:58,342
- Yes.
- What did you hear?

1161
01:25:58,850 --> 01:26:01,851
l heard you ask me to marry you.

1162
01:26:02,604 --> 01:26:04,431
Good. There is something else, too.

1163
01:26:06,734 --> 01:26:08,857
ls there?

1164
01:26:10,530 --> 01:26:13,816
l want to have a child with you.
So what do you say?

1165
01:26:14,952 --> 01:26:18,403
l say, you're getting very demanding
all of a sudden.

1166
01:26:18,539 --> 01:26:20,496
ls there anything else you want?

1167
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,788
Yes. Make sure it's a girl.

1168
01:26:55,706 --> 01:27:00,167
Oh, Father, please believe in me

1169
01:27:00,294 --> 01:27:05,123
Oh, Father,
this is how it's got to be

1170
01:27:05,258 --> 01:27:10,004
I know you love me,
but you've got to let go

1171
01:27:10,139 --> 01:27:14,967
Oh, Father,
every flower has to grow

1172
01:27:21,610 --> 01:27:26,736
Can you accept me for who I am?

1173
01:27:26,866 --> 01:27:31,445
Just for this moment,
please be my friend

1174
01:27:32,164 --> 01:27:38,830
I need to know you're there for me

1175
01:27:41,424 --> 01:27:46,502
I'll feel much better when I know

1176
01:27:46,638 --> 01:27:51,550
That you are ready to let me go

1177
01:27:52,728 --> 01:27:59,394
I've found someone I'd like to know

1178
01:28:01,405 --> 01:28:04,027
Am I wrong?

1179
01:28:04,158 --> 01:28:08,322
It feels like
I've been waiting so long

1180
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:13,992
Don't want to hurt you

1181
01:28:14,128 --> 01:28:18,671
You've always taught me
right from wrong

1182
01:28:20,510 --> 01:28:25,635
Oh, Father, please believe in me

1183
01:28:25,766 --> 01:28:30,345
Oh, Father,
this is how it's got to be

1184
01:28:30,479 --> 01:28:35,640
I know you love me,
but you've got to let go

1185
01:28:35,777 --> 01:28:40,486
Oh, Father,
every flower has to grow

1186
01:28:40,616 --> 01:28:45,492
Oh, Father, please believe me

1187
01:28:45,621 --> 01:28:50,367
Oh, Father,
this is how it's got to be

1188
01:28:50,502 --> 01:28:55,461
I know you love me,
but you've got to let go

1189
01:28:55,591 --> 01:29:00,384
Oh, Father,
every flower has to grow

1190
01:29:01,347 --> 01:29:04,135
Can you tell me?

1191
01:29:04,267 --> 01:29:08,681
Why should I have to wait so long?

1192
01:29:11,150 --> 01:29:13,439
Not going to hurt you

1193
01:29:14,362 --> 01:29:18,775
I think I know
what's right from wrong

1194
01:29:31,214 --> 01:29:33,421
You got to choose it

1195
01:29:33,550 --> 01:29:35,590
You got to choose it

1196
01:29:40,767 --> 01:29:45,560
Oh, Father,
please believe in me...?
