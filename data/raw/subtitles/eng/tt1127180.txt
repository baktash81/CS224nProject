(thrilling orchestral music)

32
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:42,217
[Instructor] Repeat
the following phrases

33
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:44,636
precisely as spoken.

34
00:05:44,637 --> 00:05:48,098
There is no friction
with the proper diction.

35
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:51,601
[Christine] There is no
friction with the proper diction.

36
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:55,605
[Instructor] Good sounds
abound when the mouth is round.

37
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:59,319
Good sounds abound
when the mouth is round.

38
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:03,572
Round.

39
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:06,617
(gentle piano music)

40
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:26,345
I think we can make this work.

41
00:06:26,346 --> 00:06:28,472
I'll call you this
afternoon and let you know.

42
00:06:28,473 --> 00:06:29,556
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

43
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:32,017
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

44
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:33,310
- Thank you.
- Have a great day.

45
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:34,144
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you, too.

46
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:35,103
Have a good day.

47
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:36,314
Thank you. Bye.

48
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:50,410
[Woman] Here you go, Mr. Jacks.

49
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,372
[Mr. Jacks] Thank you.

50
00:06:54,374 --> 00:06:55,333
Mr. Jacks?

51
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:59,336
I was wondering if you'd
made any decision regarding

52
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:01,380
the assistant manager's position.

53
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:03,090
Oh, well, I'm still deciding,

54
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:05,884
and right now, it's
between Stu and yourself.

55
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:07,177
Stu Rubin, the new guy?

56
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:08,011
Well, I know he's new,

57
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:11,056
but he's also quite
aggressive, and we like that.

58
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:12,516
You know, Stu's someone who's not afraid

59
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:15,727
to crunch the numbers and
make the tough decisions.

60
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:18,355
I'm perfectly capable of
making the tough decisions.

61
00:07:18,356 --> 00:07:20,774
I'll let you know as soon as I decide.

62
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:21,567
Okay?

63
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,777
In the meantime, take him through

64
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:28,281
our loan qualifying procedures,
just in case, all right?

65
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:29,075
Okay.

66
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:32,452
[Mr. Jacks] Oh, and
would you mind taking

67
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:33,995
your lunch break now?

68
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:34,996
Sure.

69
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:36,039
And maybe on your way back,

70
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,208
you could pick me up a turkey club?

71
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:40,544
Turkey club, excellent choice.

72
00:07:40,545 --> 00:07:41,628
You mind picking one up for me?

73
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:42,422
Thanks.

74
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:45,091
And spicy mustard.

75
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:47,717
- What have you got?
- Get your approval on this?

76
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:49,094
This is the loan we talked

77
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:49,928
about before.
- Oh, the loan.

78
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:50,721
Exactly.

79
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:52,889
Big one, huh?

80
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:53,723
[Mr. Jacks] 1.5.

81
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:57,103
[Stu] Absolutely, it'll be one of many.

82
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:00,063
Well, Professor,

83
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:02,566
congratulations on making
it through your first week.

84
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:04,609
Thank you very much.

85
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,861
Mm.

86
00:08:05,862 --> 00:08:08,029
[Christine] Thought you'd
have a full beard by now.

87
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,072
So did I.

88
00:08:09,073 --> 00:08:10,615
I'm a little disappointed.

89
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:11,783
Oh, man, this thing.

90
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:12,617
(printer whirs)

91
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:13,452
That's it. I'm done.

92
00:08:13,453 --> 00:08:14,245
I'm out.

93
00:08:15,163 --> 00:08:17,914
Chris, don't even bother.

94
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:19,374
I gotta get a new one.

95
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,709
I'm telling you, you're
gonna drive yourself nuts.

96
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,839
(loud clack)
It's completely broken.

97
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,884
Was broken.

98
00:08:28,885 --> 00:08:32,346
You are cocky and sexy and unbelievable.

99
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,266
I almost forgot.

100
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:38,268
Found it at the bank.

101
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:39,479
What is this?

102
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,439
No way!

103
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,524
Wow, it's a 1929 Standing Liberty,

104
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,568
and it's almost fully struck.

105
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:48,445
You found this in regular
circulation at the bank?

106
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:49,488
I did.

107
00:08:49,489 --> 00:08:53,617
I'm gonna add this to
my nerdy coin collection.

108
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:54,910
- Okay.
- Thank you, baby.

109
00:08:54,911 --> 00:08:57,329
Thanks for thinking of me.

110
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,288
(phone rings)

111
00:08:58,289 --> 00:08:59,122
All right.

112
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:00,081
- Bye.
- Bye.

113
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:03,628
- See you later.
- I'll see you later, okay?

114
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:05,462
Dr. Dalton.

115
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:07,714
- Hello, dear.
- Oh, hi, Mom.

116
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:09,090
[Mother] What are you doing?

117
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,675
[Clay] Christine just came
over, brought some lunch, and

118
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:11,885
I'm correcting some papers.
- Christine?

119
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:13,220
Oh, the one from the farm?

120
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:14,888
[Clay] Yeah, Mom, the
girl I've been dating

121
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:17,766
for almost a year, the girl
who's coming for dinner.

122
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:18,725
We're still on for dinner?
- I'm sure she's

123
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:19,643
a very sweet girl.

124
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:20,477
She is.

125
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:21,561
I can't wait for you to--
- But, you know, your father

126
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,855
and I just have certain
expectations for you.

127
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:24,689
[Clay] I can't really do

128
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,815
the expectations.
- I understand Amy Kulick is

129
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:27,567
looking for someone to play tennis with.

130
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:28,902
- Yeah, I.
- You know, she graduated

131
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:30,612
from Yale Law with honors,

132
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:32,864
and she's a very successful attorney now.

133
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:34,366
[Clay] I know. You told me.

134
00:09:34,367 --> 00:09:35,617
[Mother] Yeah, that's the kind of girl

135
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:37,494
I would love to see you with.

136
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:38,787
- Mother--
- She's the kind of woman

137
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:41,706
who could really help you socially

138
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:43,625
and, as a result, in your career.

139
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:44,501
And that's the kind of thing

140
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:45,794
you should be thinking about now.

141
00:09:45,795 --> 00:09:46,836
[Clay] Mother, I don't wanna--

142
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:48,171
[Mother] You can't be playing around

143
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:49,798
with little girls off the farm.

144
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,632
[Clay] I think you're
really gonna like--

145
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:54,428
[Mother] It's time to
really find a partner.

146
00:09:57,557 --> 00:10:01,434
Mm, Christine, you messed up my order.

147
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,061
No, I didn't.

148
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:04,939
Yeah, I said no mayo.

149
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:08,693
You never said that.

150
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:12,195
Know what? Don't sweat it.

151
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:12,989
It's okay.

152
00:10:21,998 --> 00:10:24,208
(chuckles)

153
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,840
[Stu] Mr. Jacks, by the
way, aren't you a Laker fan?

154
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:32,882
[Mr. Jacks] I am a Laker fan.

155
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,426
My mom is having this thing on Sunday.

156
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:35,385
I can't use these.

157
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:36,553
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

158
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:37,804
Absolutely, you want them?
- These are great seats!

159
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:38,680
They are great seats.

160
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:39,514
[Mr. Jacks] This is where they bring

161
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:40,682
the hot dogs right to you.
- Yes, it is.

162
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:42,142
You are gonna hobnob with celebs.

163
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:43,101
[Mr. Jacks] You sure that's okay?

164
00:10:43,102 --> 00:10:44,227
[Stu] Absolutely, it's okay.

165
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:45,228
Yeah.
- Well, thank you, Stu.

166
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:46,813
Take them. Absolutely.
(tapping)

167
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:49,692
Say hey to Kobe for me.
- Of course.

168
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:54,905
Will you help me?

169
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:56,656
Of course.

170
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:57,699
What can I do for you?

171
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,993
Your trucks are at my house.

172
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:04,331
The men are packing all
my things, private things.

173
00:11:04,332 --> 00:11:06,708
Please, make them stop.

174
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:08,919
(coughing)

175
00:11:12,465 --> 00:11:13,381
Mrs.--

176
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:14,341
Ganush.

177
00:11:14,342 --> 00:11:15,759
(hawking)

178
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,137
Mrs. Ganush, the bank is
informing you of their intent

179
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:22,849
to repossess your property
at 325 Brandon Street today.

180
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,728
But this is my home for 30 years.

181
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:30,983
And I make every payment until
the sickness took my eye.

182
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:33,652
I hope to have more money soon.

183
00:11:33,653 --> 00:11:36,321
I just need a little more time.

184
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:37,572
You--
- I don't think my manager's

185
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:40,367
going to extend you any more credit.

186
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:41,409
Oh.

187
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,870
Please.
(squishing)

188
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:44,997
Won't you try?

189
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:51,503
Okay.

190
00:11:51,504 --> 00:11:52,463
Bless you.

191
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:54,882
Bless you!

192
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,264
We have an elderly woman
asking for an extension

193
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:05,350
on her mortgage payment.

194
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:06,351
She's on a fixed income,

195
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:08,937
and she's had some medical problems.

196
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:12,983
There's gotta be something
we can do to help her.

197
00:12:14,694 --> 00:12:16,987
(squishing)

198
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:20,407
Well, apparently, we've already granted

199
00:12:20,408 --> 00:12:22,158
her two extensions.

200
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,868
And, you know, on this
type of foreclosure,

201
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:26,037
we seize the trapped equity

202
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:28,665
and the bank makes a
sizable amount in fees.

203
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,917
We would have to throw
her out of her house.

204
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,878
It's a tough decision.

205
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:34,839
Your call.

206
00:12:47,393 --> 00:12:50,438
(gentle piano music)

207
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:02,575
I'll take care of it.

208
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,961
(squishing)

209
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,220
Mrs. Ganush.

210
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:25,555
I'm sorry, Mrs. Ganush,

211
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:28,391
but another extension on the
loan is out of the question.

212
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:29,309
What?

213
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,102
I would like to help,
but it is in the bank's--

214
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:34,355
No, please, this is my home.

215
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,816
Where will I live?

216
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:38,526
You list your
granddaughter as a reference.

217
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:39,652
Maybe you could stay with her.

218
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:41,697
I would not burden her.

219
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:45,241
And there are several fine
assisted living facilities

220
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:47,368
for the elderly.
- A nursing home?

221
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:51,165
No, I would never live
in one of those places.

222
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,959
I'm really sorry.

223
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:22,070
I am proud woman, Miss Brown,

224
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:25,115
and never have I begged for anything.

225
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:29,078
But now, I beg for you.

226
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,956
I humble myself before you.
- Mrs. Ganush, Mrs. Ganush,

227
00:14:32,957 --> 00:14:35,917
please, please stand up.
- I, Sylvia Ganush, beg.

228
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:38,546
On my mother's grave, I beg you!

229
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:40,463
Please let go.

230
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:41,422
Let go!

231
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:42,507
Security!

232
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:43,383
Stop!
(loud thud)

233
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:45,468
(groans)

234
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:46,302
[Woman] Over here, Billy!

235
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:48,763
Over here!
- We're coming.

236
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:51,141
(chattering)

237
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:57,857
You shame me.

238
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:02,987
(somber orchestral music)

239
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:10,953
I beg you, and you shame me.

240
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,624
I think your business
is finished here, ma'am.

241
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,418
Let's go.

242
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,383
Mrs. Ganush.

243
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:29,513
(screaming)
(thrilling orchestral music)

244
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:37,645
(grunting)

245
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:38,771
[Guard] Go, ma'am.

246
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,316
[Guard] Let's go.

247
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,489
I never saw anything
quite like that before.

248
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,533
Are you okay?

249
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:55,122
You handled that just right, you know.

250
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:58,667
(coughing)

251
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:06,132
[Guard] Good night.

252
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,133
See you tomorrow.

253
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,344
[Woman] Okay.

254
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:14,432
You know, I just finished
going over this McPherson loan.

255
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:17,101
This is very impressive work.

256
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:17,936
Thanks.

257
00:16:17,937 --> 00:16:19,479
Would you mind taking this home tonight

258
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,438
and finishing it up?

259
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:21,731
Because I would like to show it

260
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:23,775
to the regional veep in the morning.

261
00:16:23,776 --> 00:16:24,943
I would love to.

262
00:16:24,944 --> 00:16:26,945
- Great.
- Thank you.

263
00:16:26,946 --> 00:16:31,449
Oh, and as far as that
assistant manager's position goes,

264
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,869
you're at the top of the list.

265
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:45,964
(door creaks)

266
00:16:45,965 --> 00:16:48,342
(door slams)

267
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:57,267
(ominous orchestral music)

268
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:11,073
(suspenseful orchestral music)

269
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,011
(coughing)

270
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:45,232
(engine revs)

271
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:07,921

(shrieks)

272
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:22,144
(breathing heavily)

273
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,607
(gasps)

274
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:28,901
You shamed me.

275
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,653
(screams)

276
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:34,572
(speaking in foreign language)

277
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:36,867

(groans)

316
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:37,196
I beat you, you old bitch!

317
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,203
(panting)

318
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,748

(grunting)

324
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:08,017
No!

(screams)

326
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:19,404

(exhales loudly)

329
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:36,713
Lamia.

330
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,109
Soon it will be you who
comes begging to me.

331
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:09,705
(fly buzzing)

332
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:18,130
(ominous orchestral music)

333
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:29,056
(chattering)

334
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:29,932
[Officer] She's right over there.

335
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:32,435
Thank you, thank you.

336
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:33,228
Hey.

337
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:40,401
Once they send some officers
over to have a talk with her,

338
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:41,902
she's not gonna be
bothering you anymore, okay?

339
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:43,404
So don't even think about her.

340
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:44,989
And I'm gonna call Mr.
Jacks and just make sure

341
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,283
he can have somebody walk you
to your car every night, okay?

342
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:49,201
[Christine] Okay.

343
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:51,871
Just thank God you're okay.

344
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:53,789
You are okay, right?

345
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,666
I'm fine.

346
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:57,835
What?

347
00:22:57,836 --> 00:22:59,837
What's the matter?

348
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:01,131
It's just that

349
00:23:02,174 --> 00:23:04,633
maybe I could have gotten her
another extension on her loan.

350
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:06,010
Chris, no, don't do that.

351
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:07,011
You said the bank granted

352
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:09,347
this woman two extensions already, right?

353
00:23:09,348 --> 00:23:10,639
I'm sorry, if you don't pay your mortgage,

354
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,474
you lose your house.

355
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:12,808
What does this woman expect?

356
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:14,101
It's not your fault.

357
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:15,394
You can't beat yourself up over it.

358
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:17,480
(wind blowing)

359
00:23:17,481 --> 00:23:20,108
(loud whooshes)

360
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:33,747
(high-pitched buzz)

361
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:42,546
What is it?

362
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:43,672
What's wrong?

363
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,883
Did you hear that?

364
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:47,093
What?

365
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:48,804
Really? You didn't?

366
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,180
No.

367
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:51,973
What?

368
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:57,561
I know this is gonna sound weird,

369
00:23:57,562 --> 00:24:00,398
but I wanna get my fortune read.

370
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:02,066
(laughs)

371
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:03,401
Now?

372
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:04,694
Are you kidding?

373
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:06,987
Come on, Chris.

374
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:08,823
I'll read your fortune for you.

375
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:11,242
Mm, in the near future, we
are gonna get in the car,

376
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:12,076
go home, and relax.
- Clay, I really want

377
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:12,953
to do this.

378
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:17,206
Why, because of what
happened with that old woman?

379
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:21,336
Chris, I really think we
should just get you home now.

380
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:24,964
Can you do this for me?

381
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:27,174
(bell jingling)

382
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:30,887
(upbeat Indian violin music)

383
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:36,183
Pray to God none of
my students see me here.

384
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:37,685
The only class I'll be able to teach is,

385
00:24:37,686 --> 00:24:39,312
like, Hypocrisy 101.

386
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:44,108
Hm, so many things to choose from here.

387
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:45,609
Unfortunately, not what I'm looking for,

388
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,945
which is a weird little dried monkey head.

389
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:49,697
Oh, wait, no, never mind, he's got one.

390
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:52,825
Shh.
(curtain rattling)

391
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:54,619
I am Rham Jas, seer.

392
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:58,205
I'm Christine and this is Clay.

393
00:24:58,206 --> 00:24:59,498
You probably already knew that, right?

394
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:01,710
(chuckles)

395
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:04,336
Just kidding.

396
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:05,504
How can I help you?

397
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:07,882
I would like to have my fortune read.

398
00:25:07,883 --> 00:25:09,258
Can you do that?

399
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:12,261
I have the ability to
see certain energies.

400
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:15,973
Sometimes these energies are
a foretoken of things to come.

401
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:17,308
$60, please.

402
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:18,434
Seriously?

403
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:19,268
Yes.

404
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:20,769
60.

405
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,938
Doesn't that seem a little
steep for this sort of thing?

406
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:25,817
If you're not serious, please go.

407
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:27,818
All right. Come on, Chris.

408
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:28,777
Wait, wait.

409
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:30,446
I'll pay.
- Oh.

410
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:31,447
No, you know what?

411
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:32,781
All right. I got it.

412
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:33,575
I got it.

413
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:36,368
There you go.

414
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:37,536
Platinum card.

415
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:38,829
Very good.

416
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:42,542
(upbeat Indian violin music)

417
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:46,420
[Christine] Thank you.

418
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:47,421
[Clay] Here. Here.

419
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:48,715
- Thanks.
- Sure.

420
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:53,093
Ah, ah.

421
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:53,887
Please.

422
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,850
So, you wish to know
something of your destiny.

423
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:01,143
- Yes.
- Very good.

424
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:02,770
Let's see what the fates have in store.

425
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:04,230
[Clay] You know, Freud
said destiny was not

426
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:06,148
an act of fate, but
rather something created

427
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:08,692
by our subconscious to
control our conscious choices.

428
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:09,944
That's true.

429
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:11,153
But we cannot attempt to understand

430
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:13,864
the world by intellect alone.

431
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:15,407
[Clay] Oh, Carl Jung.

432
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:19,120
Yes, from his treatise
Psychological Types.

433
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,913
[Christine] So--

434
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:23,457
Jung, New Agers' favorite psychologist.

435
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:25,876
Because he wasn't afraid to
bring God into the equation.

436
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:27,336
Well, he wasn't afraid to bring God--

437
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:28,629
- Clay, Clay, come on.
- Let's do it.

438
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,797
I know. Come on.

439
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:30,714
Let's start.

440
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:31,674
[Rham] Shall we?

441
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:32,800
I'm ready.

442
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:35,553
Well, please, give me your hand.

443
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:36,554
[Christine] Okay.

444
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:37,388
This way.

445
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:38,181
Okay.

446
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:46,731
You work with money.

447
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:49,067
That's right.

448
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:54,947
[Rham] And you've
recently lost something.

449
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:56,740
No, I don't think so.

450
00:26:56,741 --> 00:26:58,284
No.

451
00:26:58,285 --> 00:27:01,370
No, you haven't lost anything.

452
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:04,707
But something's been taken from you.

453
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:05,500
No.

454
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:07,626
A button.

455
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:08,836
Oh, my God.

456
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:10,296
Yes.

457
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:12,006
Well, anyone can see
she's missing a button.

458
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:13,465
So what?
- Clay, it was really strange.

459
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:16,093
The old woman today, she
took a button from my sleeve.

460
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:17,136
Why would she do that?

461
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:20,265
You would both please just be quiet.

462
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:31,901
(ominous orchestral music)

463
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:37,574
(bells jingling)

464
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,704
(wind blowing)

465
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:52,631
(soft cracking)

466
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:16,738
(exhales loudly)

467
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:21,743
(screeches)

468
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:34,421
I think that's enough for tonight.

469
00:28:34,422 --> 00:28:35,798
What's wrong?

470
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:39,301
I'm tired, and I see
it's become quite late.

471
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:41,470
I will, of course, refund your money.

472
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:42,554
Wait, wait, wait!

473
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,349
Did you see something?

474
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,184
A dark spirit has come upon you.

475
00:28:47,185 --> 00:28:48,310
What do you mean?

476
00:28:48,311 --> 00:28:49,645
- Well, he's--
- Did you blaspheme the dead

477
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:50,896
while visiting a graveyard?

478
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:51,730
No!

479
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:52,856
Did you play with a Ouija board

480
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:54,775
or consort with those who
practice the black arts?

481
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:55,776
All right, take it easy, man.

482
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:56,860
Come on.
- Wait, Clay, Clay, Clay.

483
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:58,238
No. No, I didn't.

484
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:01,198
Perhaps someone has cursed you.

485
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:04,911
(unnerving orchestral music)

486
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:09,540
Then how did he know all that?

487
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:12,167
Know what, that you lost a button?

488
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:13,794
And by the way, he didn't
really know that much.

489
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:15,170
He makes a couple of good guesses,

490
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:16,463
then he stirs you up,

491
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:18,799
and then he leaves you
with all these questions

492
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,427
and, conveniently, his business card.

493
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:22,261
(chuckles)

494
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:25,013
Come on, Chris, he's a scam artist.

495
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:26,515
But he didn't want the money.

496
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:28,225
He tried to give it back, remember?

497
00:29:28,226 --> 00:29:29,852
Well, he sort of tried,

498
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:32,981
but in the end, he took it, didn't he?

499
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:35,984
I guess so.

500
00:29:39,654 --> 00:29:43,199
(ominous orchestral music)

501
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:01,967
I gotta go meet the guy
that's towing your car,

502
00:30:01,968 --> 00:30:02,843
so you gonna be okay?

503
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:03,802
- Yeah.
- All right.

504
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:05,304
Kitty, take care of her.
(cat mews)

505
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:06,138
I'll see you in about an hour.

506
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:07,014
Love you.
- Okay.

507
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:07,807
Okay.

508
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:17,859
(wind blowing)

509
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:41,591
(oven dings)

510
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:46,721
(cat mews)

511
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:10,328
(wooden creak)

512
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:22,215
(rattling)

513
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:25,593
(cat mews)

514
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:32,684
(creaking)

515
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:53,872
(rattling)
(metallic creak)

516
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:02,589
(metallic creak)

517
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:08,970
(metallic creak)

518
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:13,307
(wooden creak)

519
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:16,768
(metallic creak)

520
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:20,857
(metallic creak)
(wooden creak)

521
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:31,992
(metallic creak)
(wind blowing)

522
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:33,243
(loud roar)
(shrieks)

523
00:32:33,244 --> 00:32:36,330
(loud thud)

524
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:38,206
(loud thud)
(cat mewing)

525
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:40,585
(loud crash)

526
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:47,592
(loud clanking)

527
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:51,512
(wind howling)

528
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:17,038
(ominous orchestral music)

529
00:33:25,588 --> 00:33:26,797
(groaning)

530
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:27,631
(screeching)

531
00:33:27,632 --> 00:33:28,465
(loud thud)
(groans)

532
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:30,760
(loud thud)

533
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:42,939
(panting)

534
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:57,869
Here, put that on your lip.

535
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,745
- Thank you.
- I can't believe

536
00:33:58,746 --> 00:33:59,746
she came to the house.

537
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:00,706
This is so nuts.

538
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:01,748
I'm calling the cops.

539
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:03,417
It wasn't her.

540
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:05,085
Who was it then?

541
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:07,045
I don't know, I couldn't see who it was.

542
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:08,296
Of course it was her, had to be her.

543
00:34:08,297 --> 00:34:10,424
No, Clay, it wasn't anyone!

544
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:11,466
It was somebody.

545
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:12,592
Chris, it had to be somebody.

546
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:14,136
The lights were out, you
just couldn't see who it was,

547
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:15,220
but I'm guessing it was--
- Clay, there wasn't

548
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:16,264
anybody here.

549
00:34:18,182 --> 00:34:19,809
Then who did this?

550
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:23,730
Who hit you in the face?

551
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:26,190
Huh?

552
00:34:30,695 --> 00:34:31,862
I think it's just a reaction

553
00:34:31,863 --> 00:34:33,697
to her being attacked earlier in the day.

554
00:34:33,698 --> 00:34:36,116
[Clay] Yeah, classic symptoms
of post-traumatic stress.

555
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:37,117
[Doctor] Yeah, she's showing signs

556
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:39,661
of panic and paranoia, so.

557
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:40,871
[Clay] Want me to walk you out, man?

558
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:42,122
[Doctor] No, no, no, no, I'm fine.

559
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:43,248
All right.

560
00:34:43,249 --> 00:34:45,626
(door thuds)

561
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:47,962
Oh, hey, hey.

562
00:34:49,964 --> 00:34:51,256
How you doing?

563
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:52,549
- Better.
- Yeah?

564
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,843
Especially after the
doctor explained it to me.

565
00:34:54,844 --> 00:34:57,179
He said that victims of violence, they--

566
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,556
Re-experience their trauma.

567
00:34:59,557 --> 00:35:03,894
I misinterpreted it to be
something more than it was.

568
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:05,479
Happens.

569
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,023
I just, I feel...

570
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:10,567
- What?
- Kind of embarrassed.

571
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:11,485
Are you kidding?

572
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:12,611
No.

573
00:35:12,612 --> 00:35:16,698
You never have to be embarrassed with me.

574
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:17,492
Okay?

575
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:25,040
Hey, listen, I was thinking
maybe we could take

576
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:27,334
a little trip on Saturday,

577
00:35:27,335 --> 00:35:29,086
get on the train and go to Santa Barbara.

578
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:30,212
Your folks' cabin.

579
00:35:30,213 --> 00:35:31,338
[Clay] Yeah, if you're
up for it, the cabin.

580
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:32,839
Oh, my God, I would love to!

581
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,924
Yeah? Oh, good.

582
00:35:33,925 --> 00:35:34,758
[Christine] That'd be so exciting.

583
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:36,551
Oh, baby, you're gonna love it.

584
00:35:36,552 --> 00:35:37,969
You're gonna love it, I'm
excited for you to see.

585
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:38,804
There's trees

586
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:40,430
and it's private.
- That would be great.

587
00:35:40,431 --> 00:35:41,264
It'll be great.

588
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:42,099
It'll be good.

589
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,100
I think we need to.

590
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:46,729
And we can just, we can
just talk and stuff.

591
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:53,528
(ominous orchestral music)

592
00:36:16,926 --> 00:36:19,970
(wooden creak)

593
00:36:19,971 --> 00:36:22,431
(fly buzzing)

594
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:16,526
(coughing)

595
00:37:16,527 --> 00:37:17,944
(gasps)

596
00:37:17,945 --> 00:37:21,824
(suspenseful orchestral music)

597
00:37:37,548 --> 00:37:38,798
(growls)
(screams)

598
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:40,091
(snarls)
(screams)

599
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:40,926
(growls)
(screams)

600
00:37:40,927 --> 00:37:45,056
(barking)
(screaming)

601
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:51,186
(screams)
(roars)

602
00:37:51,187 --> 00:37:52,646
(coughing)

603
00:37:52,647 --> 00:37:55,315
(gasps)

604
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:56,108
What?

605
00:37:57,985 --> 00:38:00,278
What's the matter?

606
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:01,989
I couldn't wake up.

607
00:38:03,032 --> 00:38:03,865
It's okay.

608
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:04,991
Okay.

609
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:06,201
Come here.

610
00:38:06,202 --> 00:38:10,122
Was just a dream.
(wind blowing)

611
00:38:19,882 --> 00:38:20,882
Oh, baby, that's the rental car

612
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:22,801
they dropped off this morning.

613
00:38:22,802 --> 00:38:23,635
Okay?
- Thanks.

614
00:38:23,636 --> 00:38:25,303
Sure.

615
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:26,263
Love you.

616
00:38:26,264 --> 00:38:27,473
Love you too.

617
00:38:29,183 --> 00:38:33,312
Hey, baby, try not to piss
off any old ladies today, okay?

618
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:46,617
(fly buzzing)

619
00:38:51,122 --> 00:38:52,289
(gasps)

620
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,207
[Stu] Hey, Christine?

621
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,458
What, are you just getting here?

622
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:56,668
What are you, the hall monitor?

623
00:38:56,669 --> 00:38:58,920
Ha, ha, very funny, Christine.

624
00:38:58,921 --> 00:38:59,879
Oh.

625
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,840
What's this?

626
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:03,883
What do you want?

627
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:07,972
I need you to finish teaching
me the loan procedures.

628
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,015
I've got a lot on my mind.

629
00:39:10,016 --> 00:39:11,975
Can we do this tomorrow?

630
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:13,435
- Sure.
- Okay.

631
00:39:13,436 --> 00:39:14,602
I'll just tell Mr. Jacks

632
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:15,603
that you don't have the time right now.

633
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:17,814
Maybe he can tell me.
- No, no!

634
00:39:17,815 --> 00:39:19,482
Okay, I'll do it.

635
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:20,234
Okay.

636
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:25,405
We were going over the
asset-based lending guidelines.

637
00:39:25,406 --> 00:39:26,323
Right.

638
00:39:26,324 --> 00:39:27,866
Let's say your client is a company

639
00:39:27,867 --> 00:39:30,535
that can't get traditional bank financing.

640
00:39:30,536 --> 00:39:31,411
(gasps)

641
00:39:31,412 --> 00:39:33,539
(tapping)

642
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,839
And?

643
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,801
Uh, and.
(tapping)

644
00:39:49,138 --> 00:39:50,097
[Stu] And?

645
00:39:52,641 --> 00:39:53,434
And.

646
00:39:56,562 --> 00:40:00,191
And get your filthy pig
knuckle off my desk!

647
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,611
(phone rings)

648
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:09,449
Christine Blood.

649
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,825
Brown.

650
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:12,535
Christine.

651
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:13,329
Your nose.

652
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:16,456
Uh, sure, can you hold?

653
00:40:16,457 --> 00:40:17,290
Let me help you.

654
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:18,291
No, no, I've got it under control.

655
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:19,709
(groans)
- Oh, my God!

656
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:20,586
Oh, my God!

657
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:23,046
Oh, God!

658
00:40:23,047 --> 00:40:24,047
Oh, my God!

659
00:40:24,048 --> 00:40:25,590
Stop it!

660
00:40:25,591 --> 00:40:26,966
[Woman] Mr. Jacks!

661
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:28,009
- Did I get any in my mouth?
- Mr. Jacks--

662
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:30,303
- Oh, my God!
- Did I get any in my mouth?

663
00:40:30,304 --> 00:40:32,097
Let me take you over here to get clean.

664
00:40:32,098 --> 00:40:34,057
- I'm so sorry!
- Why did you do that?

665
00:40:34,058 --> 00:40:35,683
[Christine] Oh, my God!

666
00:40:35,684 --> 00:40:36,643
[Mr. Jacks] What was that about?

667
00:40:36,644 --> 00:40:38,269
- It's just a nosebleed.
- Disgusting, ugh!

668
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,938
[Mr. Jacks] Did I get any in my mouth?

669
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:40,772
[Woman] We'll clean you up.

670
00:40:40,773 --> 00:40:41,773
We have antiseptic.

671
00:40:41,774 --> 00:40:43,818
There's blood everywhere.

672
00:40:44,944 --> 00:40:48,489
(ominous orchestral music)

673
00:41:13,431 --> 00:41:16,224
(wind blowing)

674
00:41:16,225 --> 00:41:18,436
(knocking)

675
00:41:21,647 --> 00:41:24,775
(wind chime tinkling)

676
00:41:30,531 --> 00:41:33,075
(wooden creak)

677
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:36,120
[Woman] What is it?

678
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:40,748
Hi.

679
00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:42,041
I came to see Sylvia Ganush.

680
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:43,543
Is she here?

681
00:41:43,544 --> 00:41:45,962
[Woman] Who are you?

682
00:41:45,963 --> 00:41:47,840
I'm a friend of hers.

683
00:41:49,133 --> 00:41:50,426
Someone--
- Wait.

684
00:41:54,013 --> 00:41:56,139
I know who you are.

685
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,099
Grandma told me you would come.

686
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:01,603
You are the woman from the bank,
the one who took her house.

687
00:42:01,604 --> 00:42:03,313
Actually, it was the
bank that took the house.

688
00:42:03,314 --> 00:42:05,899
I mean, I just work there.

689
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:09,402
In fact, I tried to help your
grandma get the house back,

690
00:42:09,403 --> 00:42:11,070
but my boss wouldn't let me.

691
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:13,364
Are you going to stand here on my porch

692
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:14,909
and lie to my face?

693
00:42:20,498 --> 00:42:21,915
No.

694
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:25,628
You used to be a real
fat girl, didn't you?

695
00:42:31,509 --> 00:42:32,592
Yeah.

696
00:42:32,593 --> 00:42:33,636
I can tell.

697
00:42:34,845 --> 00:42:37,514
You are not welcome here.

698
00:42:37,515 --> 00:42:38,848
Wait!

699
00:42:38,849 --> 00:42:40,433
Wait, I need to see her.

700
00:42:40,434 --> 00:42:42,310
I need her to forgive me.

701
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:43,645
And I'll get her the house back.

702
00:42:43,646 --> 00:42:45,730
And you're gonna make
everything all right for her,

703
00:42:45,731 --> 00:42:46,606
is that it?

704
00:42:46,607 --> 00:42:47,399
Yes.

705
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,152
Come on.

706
00:42:52,571 --> 00:42:55,783
(elegant violin music)

707
00:43:05,918 --> 00:43:07,127
Where is she?

708
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,890
(laughing)

709
00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:22,934
(people chattering)

710
00:43:22,935 --> 00:43:26,814
(speaking in foreign language)

711
00:43:30,693 --> 00:43:34,572
(speaking in foreign language)

712
00:43:39,785 --> 00:43:43,330
(ominous orchestral music)

713
00:43:50,296 --> 00:43:51,713
(loud thud)
(shrieks)

714
00:43:51,714 --> 00:43:53,047
(gasps)

715
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:54,757
(wooden creak)

716
00:43:54,758 --> 00:43:56,759
(loud crash)

717
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,969
(loud splashing)
(crowd gasps)

718
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:59,679
(screaming)

719
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,431
Get her off me!

720
00:44:01,432 --> 00:44:02,473
Get her off me!
- Come!

721
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:03,350
Don't look.

722
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,477
[Man] Grab her shoulder.

723
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:07,979
(screams)
- No, no, lift her up!

724
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,230
(grunts)
(screams)

725
00:44:09,231 --> 00:44:12,192
(people chattering)

726
00:44:14,528 --> 00:44:16,529
[Man] Be careful.

727
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:19,157
[Man] Let's roll the dice!

728
00:44:19,158 --> 00:44:23,745
Still going to make
everything all right for her?

729
00:44:23,746 --> 00:44:26,205
You deserve everything
that is coming to you.

730
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:29,167
(yelling in foreign language)

731
00:44:29,168 --> 00:44:32,129
(people chattering)

732
00:44:35,007 --> 00:44:37,925
I believe what plagues you is the Lamia.

733
00:44:37,926 --> 00:44:40,303
Lamia, that's the
word the old woman used.

734
00:44:40,304 --> 00:44:41,721
The Black Goat,

735
00:44:41,722 --> 00:44:45,099
only summoned by gypsies
for their darkest deeds.

736
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,225
For the first three days,

737
00:44:46,226 --> 00:44:48,436
the Lamia appears as a nasty spirit

738
00:44:48,437 --> 00:44:50,647
that torments its victim.

739
00:44:50,648 --> 00:44:53,608
After that, it reveals itself
to be a taker of souls,

740
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:56,152
and it comes for the owner
of the accursed object.

741
00:44:56,153 --> 00:44:56,986
Accursed object.

742
00:44:56,987 --> 00:44:57,820
What object?

743
00:44:57,821 --> 00:45:01,950
Something taken from the
victim, cursed and given back.

744
00:45:05,162 --> 00:45:05,954
This?

745
00:45:08,666 --> 00:45:09,999
What if I just burn it?

746
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,503
I'm afraid no matter what
condition the button is in,

747
00:45:13,504 --> 00:45:15,338
you would still be the owner.

748
00:45:15,339 --> 00:45:17,423
The Lamia would still come to take you.

749
00:45:17,424 --> 00:45:19,050
Take me where?

750
00:45:19,051 --> 00:45:22,554
(ominous orchestral music)

751
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:27,183
Then how do I get rid of this?

752
00:45:27,184 --> 00:45:30,019
You could attempt to appease the spirit.

753
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,854
The simplest way would
be a blood offering.

754
00:45:31,855 --> 00:45:35,942
A small creature could be
sacrificed, a chicken perhaps.

755
00:45:35,943 --> 00:45:36,776
No way!

756
00:45:36,777 --> 00:45:38,069
Look, I'm a vegetarian.

757
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:41,030
I volunteer at the puppy
shelter, for Christ's sake.

758
00:45:41,031 --> 00:45:43,241
I don't go around killing animals.

759
00:45:43,242 --> 00:45:45,118
You will be surprised
what you'll be willing to do

760
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,496
when the Lamia comes for you.

761
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:51,625
This will show you how.

762
00:45:59,007 --> 00:45:59,841
(loud squish)

763
00:45:59,842 --> 00:46:02,469
(goat bleating)

764
00:46:05,472 --> 00:46:07,932
(cat mews)

765
00:46:07,933 --> 00:46:08,726
Hi!

766
00:46:10,102 --> 00:46:12,312
(cat mews)

767
00:46:15,274 --> 00:46:18,818
(metallic creak)

768
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:20,946
(banging)

769
00:46:24,992 --> 00:46:28,871
(suspenseful orchestral music)

770
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,544
(wooden creak)

771
00:46:47,389 --> 00:46:49,516
(banging)

772
00:47:13,332 --> 00:47:15,459
(banging)

773
00:47:17,836 --> 00:47:19,253
(screeches)

774
00:47:19,254 --> 00:47:22,006
(roaring)

775
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:24,384
(screeching)

776
00:47:38,774 --> 00:47:41,235
(door clacks)

777
00:47:44,905 --> 00:47:46,697
(door slams)

778
00:47:46,698 --> 00:47:48,909
(stomping)

779
00:47:51,578 --> 00:47:53,789
(snarling)

780
00:48:05,008 --> 00:48:07,636
(loud clunking)

781
00:48:18,272 --> 00:48:20,481
(phone rings)

782
00:48:20,482 --> 00:48:23,110
(phone buzzing)

783
00:48:25,779 --> 00:48:28,407
(phone ringing)

784
00:48:33,996 --> 00:48:36,206
(stomping)

785
00:48:51,263 --> 00:48:53,222
(growls)

786
00:48:53,223 --> 00:48:54,557
(phone beeping)

787
00:48:54,558 --> 00:48:56,893
(static crackling)

788
00:48:56,894 --> 00:48:59,478
(screeches)

789
00:48:59,479 --> 00:49:01,690
(growling)

790
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:12,491
(screeches)

791
00:49:12,492 --> 00:49:13,367
(loud crash)

792
00:49:13,368 --> 00:49:17,538
(groans)
(screams)

793
00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:19,833
(screaming)

794
00:49:25,964 --> 00:49:26,797
(loud crash)

795
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:29,258
(groans)

796
00:49:29,259 --> 00:49:34,055
(screeching)
(rumbling)

797
00:49:34,056 --> 00:49:36,683
(bird chirping)

798
00:49:41,104 --> 00:49:44,650
(ominous orchestral music)

799
00:49:56,036 --> 00:49:57,579
Here, kitty, kitty.

800
00:49:58,705 --> 00:50:00,832
(panting)

801
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:05,420
(cat mews)

802
00:50:08,423 --> 00:50:12,552
(screaming)
(cat shrieking)

803
00:50:19,309 --> 00:50:20,393
Chris?

804
00:50:20,394 --> 00:50:22,812
Chris?
(gasps)

805
00:50:22,813 --> 00:50:23,605
Chris?

806
00:50:25,774 --> 00:50:27,358
Hey, there you are.

807
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:28,734
What you doing out here?

808
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,568
Baby, I called the bank.

809
00:50:29,569 --> 00:50:30,403
They said you left early.

810
00:50:30,404 --> 00:50:32,530
You're not answering my calls.

811
00:50:32,531 --> 00:50:33,657
Is that blood?

812
00:50:36,785 --> 00:50:37,910
No.

813
00:50:37,911 --> 00:50:39,453
Why would there be blood?

814
00:50:39,454 --> 00:50:42,540
Yeah, baby, there's
blood on your sleeve.

815
00:50:42,541 --> 00:50:43,541
- Oh.
- Are you bleeding?

816
00:50:43,542 --> 00:50:46,544
No, um, it was just tomato juice.

817
00:50:46,545 --> 00:50:48,879
I was cutting a tomato in the kitchen

818
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,925
and it must have gotten on my sleeve.

819
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:57,431
Hey, Chris, why don't we
do this dinner another time?

820
00:50:58,598 --> 00:51:00,433
You've had a rough couple of days.

821
00:51:00,434 --> 00:51:01,267
I think it's better.

822
00:51:01,268 --> 00:51:03,477
No, I want to go to the dinner.

823
00:51:03,478 --> 00:51:07,607
I know, but are you sure
you're feeling all right?

824
00:51:08,608 --> 00:51:10,819
Honestly, I haven't been.

825
00:51:11,987 --> 00:51:15,032
(gentle piano music)

826
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:21,204
But I think that everything
is gonna be okay now.

827
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:25,375
I really do.

828
00:51:30,422 --> 00:51:31,882
What do you think?

829
00:51:35,719 --> 00:51:37,261
You look beautiful.

830
00:51:37,262 --> 00:51:39,306
(laughs)

831
00:51:40,891 --> 00:51:42,433
[Christine] God, it's such a nice day.

832
00:51:42,434 --> 00:51:43,768
It really is.

833
00:51:43,769 --> 00:51:47,146
God, it's gonna be nice inside too.

834
00:51:47,147 --> 00:51:49,148
(doorbell rings)

835
00:51:49,149 --> 00:51:51,026
They're gonna love you.

836
00:51:53,904 --> 00:51:55,488
- Clayton.
- Hello, Mother.

837
00:51:55,489 --> 00:51:56,864
Good to see you, this is Christine.

838
00:51:56,865 --> 00:51:57,990
That's my mom, Trudy.

839
00:51:57,991 --> 00:51:58,866
Hello, Christine.

840
00:51:58,867 --> 00:51:59,742
Hello.

841
00:51:59,743 --> 00:52:01,577
It's very nice to meet you.

842
00:52:01,578 --> 00:52:02,536
Oh. Well.

843
00:52:02,537 --> 00:52:03,537
Please, come in.

844
00:52:03,538 --> 00:52:04,331
Come in.

845
00:52:05,415 --> 00:52:06,373
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, son.

846
00:52:06,374 --> 00:52:08,584
How are you? Good to see you, sir.

847
00:52:08,585 --> 00:52:10,377
This is Christine, Christine,
this is my dad, Leonard.

848
00:52:10,378 --> 00:52:11,295
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, hi, Maria.

849
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:12,713
Thank you.
- You have a beautiful home.

850
00:52:12,714 --> 00:52:16,008
Oh, well, thank you very much.

851
00:52:16,009 --> 00:52:16,884
Can I get you a drink?

852
00:52:16,885 --> 00:52:17,718
Yeah, wine?

853
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:19,136
Do you guys want?
- Sure.

854
00:52:19,137 --> 00:52:21,305
Okay, come help me.

855
00:52:21,306 --> 00:52:23,224
- I'll be right back.
- Mm-hm.

856
00:52:23,225 --> 00:52:24,183
I'll take a Chardonnay!

857
00:52:24,184 --> 00:52:26,727
[Leonard] Yes, dear.

858
00:52:26,728 --> 00:52:27,686
I hope you don't mind.

859
00:52:27,687 --> 00:52:29,438
Oh, how thoughtful.

860
00:52:29,439 --> 00:52:30,272
Homemade?

861
00:52:30,273 --> 00:52:31,232
Yes.

862
00:52:31,233 --> 00:52:34,151
And what type of cake
would you call that?

863
00:52:34,152 --> 00:52:37,364
Uh, it's called a, um, harvest cake.

864
00:52:38,573 --> 00:52:42,660
Is that something you
would make on a farm?

865
00:52:42,661 --> 00:52:43,453
No.

866
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:47,123
I mean, not anymore.

867
00:52:47,124 --> 00:52:50,502
We used to when we had a gaggle of geese.

868
00:52:51,795 --> 00:52:52,753
Geese?

869
00:52:52,754 --> 00:52:54,421
Well, right around the harvest time,

870
00:52:54,422 --> 00:52:58,217
that's when your goose eggs
will make a real dense yolk.

871
00:52:58,218 --> 00:53:00,011
Makes for a rich cake.

872
00:53:00,887 --> 00:53:02,513
Mm.

873
00:53:02,514 --> 00:53:04,307
Well, just, thank you.

874
00:53:05,475 --> 00:53:06,517
- Here we are.
- Sorry to interrupt

875
00:53:06,518 --> 00:53:07,893
the bonding sesh.

876
00:53:07,894 --> 00:53:09,186
Why don't you join
us in the dining room?

877
00:53:09,187 --> 00:53:10,020
- Yeah, let's go.
- Yeah.

878
00:53:10,021 --> 00:53:10,855
Okay.

879
00:53:10,856 --> 00:53:11,939
It's right in here.

880
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,107
(hissing)

881
00:53:13,108 --> 00:53:14,275
Whoa, jeez.

882
00:53:14,276 --> 00:53:15,068
Hecuba.

883
00:53:16,027 --> 00:53:17,862
Never did understand that damned animal.

884
00:53:17,863 --> 00:53:18,779
Hate cats.

885
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,281
[Trudy] That is so strange.

886
00:53:20,282 --> 00:53:22,491
Hecuba is usually very sweet.

887
00:53:22,492 --> 00:53:23,659
Oh, that's okay.

888
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:24,493
I had a cat.

889
00:53:24,494 --> 00:53:25,995
I understand.

890
00:53:25,996 --> 00:53:28,123
You mean you have a cat.

891
00:53:31,168 --> 00:53:32,334
Unless something happened to him.

892
00:53:32,335 --> 00:53:34,546
(chuckles)

893
00:53:35,922 --> 00:53:38,424
Well, how am I supposed to know?

894
00:53:38,425 --> 00:53:39,425
I mean, you know how cats are.

895
00:53:39,426 --> 00:53:41,219
They come and they go.

896
00:53:43,096 --> 00:53:44,847
(chuckles)

897
00:53:44,848 --> 00:53:45,974
That's true.

898
00:53:48,602 --> 00:53:50,102
- Well.
- Well.

899
00:53:50,103 --> 00:53:52,313
Yes. Yes, please.

900
00:53:52,314 --> 00:53:54,690
So, how's the coin collection, son?

901
00:53:54,691 --> 00:53:55,733
That's my dad's way of saying,

902
00:53:55,734 --> 00:53:56,984
"So, you're still a huge nerd?"

903
00:53:56,985 --> 00:53:57,818
(group laughs)

904
00:53:57,819 --> 00:53:58,736
It's good. It's good.

905
00:53:58,737 --> 00:53:59,695
In fact, Christine just got me

906
00:53:59,696 --> 00:54:01,989
a 1929 Standing Liberty
quarter at her bank.

907
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:03,073
- Really?
- Isn't that crazy?

908
00:54:03,074 --> 00:54:04,158
Yeah, it's rare.

909
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:05,201
Oh, I just think the job

910
00:54:05,202 --> 00:54:07,494
of a bank teller must be so difficult,

911
00:54:07,495 --> 00:54:09,914
with all that counting and repetition.

912
00:54:09,915 --> 00:54:11,373
Must get very tedious.

913
00:54:11,374 --> 00:54:14,543
Yes, you're right, but I'm not a teller.

914
00:54:14,544 --> 00:54:15,544
- Oh?
- Yeah, Mom, I told you.

915
00:54:15,545 --> 00:54:16,545
Christine's a loan officer.

916
00:54:16,546 --> 00:54:17,838
- Ah.
- She handles all the loans

917
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:20,090
for small businesses
and homes for her bank.

918
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:22,760
And she's up for this big promotion, so.

919
00:54:22,761 --> 00:54:23,802
Right, Chris?

920
00:54:23,803 --> 00:54:25,846
If I could close this one
account that I'm working on,

921
00:54:25,847 --> 00:54:27,181
it would really help.

922
00:54:27,182 --> 00:54:29,225
Well, that must be
a very important loan.

923
00:54:29,226 --> 00:54:32,102
It's the biggest that my
branch has ever handled.

924
00:54:32,103 --> 00:54:34,605
And how did that come to you?

925
00:54:34,606 --> 00:54:37,066
Well, I was reading
the Wall Street Journal

926
00:54:37,067 --> 00:54:39,235
and came across this
medical supply company

927
00:54:39,236 --> 00:54:42,738
that was looking to expand,
but didn't have the liquidity.

928
00:54:42,739 --> 00:54:45,658
So I met with their CFO
and presented a formula

929
00:54:45,659 --> 00:54:48,577
for restructuring some
of their long-term debt.

930
00:54:48,578 --> 00:54:51,205
Sounds like you've got a
lot going for you, Christine.

931
00:54:51,206 --> 00:54:54,333
Well, your mother must
be very proud of you.

932
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:55,293
I suppose.

933
00:55:01,508 --> 00:55:03,717
Uh, I don't see much of my mother.

934
00:55:03,718 --> 00:55:04,551
Why is that?

935
00:55:04,552 --> 00:55:07,221
Wow, Mom, that's, it's kind of personal.

936
00:55:07,222 --> 00:55:08,681
I'm speaking to Christine.

937
00:55:08,682 --> 00:55:10,642
(sighs)

938
00:55:12,602 --> 00:55:14,979
Uh, well, ever since my dad died,

939
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,107
um, she doesn't talk much.

940
00:55:18,275 --> 00:55:19,317
She just, uh,

941
00:55:20,777 --> 00:55:24,781
stays on the farm and
keeps to herself because...

942
00:55:26,032 --> 00:55:27,366
Because?

943
00:55:27,367 --> 00:55:29,493
Because her husband died, Mom,

944
00:55:29,494 --> 00:55:31,245
and she just wants to be by herself.

945
00:55:31,246 --> 00:55:32,079
Why don't--

946
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,958
Because my mother's an alcoholic.

947
00:55:36,126 --> 00:55:36,918
Oh.

948
00:55:38,795 --> 00:55:39,546
I'm sorry.

949
00:55:41,464 --> 00:55:44,633
It's certainly nothing to be ashamed of.

950
00:55:44,634 --> 00:55:48,721
Have to say, I find your
honesty very refreshing.

951
00:55:48,722 --> 00:55:49,847
My father had a drinking problem,

952
00:55:49,848 --> 00:55:53,183
and I was always too ashamed to admit it.

953
00:55:53,184 --> 00:55:54,811
You've got backbone.

954
00:55:55,812 --> 00:55:57,479
Unlike that last girl he brought by.

955
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,023
What was her name?

956
00:55:59,024 --> 00:56:00,024
- Alice.
- We don't have to--

957
00:56:00,025 --> 00:56:00,858
Alicia!

958
00:56:00,859 --> 00:56:01,692
- Alicia.
- Oh.

959
00:56:01,693 --> 00:56:03,110
She was dreadful, Christine.

960
00:56:03,111 --> 00:56:06,572
She was ill-mannered, no ambition at all.

961
00:56:06,573 --> 00:56:07,656
Well, they met on the internet.

962
00:56:07,657 --> 00:56:08,532
There you go.
- Oh, what is that?

963
00:56:08,533 --> 00:56:09,533
"They met on the internet"?

964
00:56:09,534 --> 00:56:10,826
- Really?
- What does that mean?

965
00:56:10,827 --> 00:56:12,161
Am I being too hard on him?

966
00:56:12,162 --> 00:56:13,620
- No, not at all.
- There you go.

967
00:56:13,621 --> 00:56:14,705
Thank you very much.
- Oh, thanks a lot.

968
00:56:14,706 --> 00:56:16,707
You know, I think I will try
some of that cake of yours.

969
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:17,708
- Toss me under the bus.
- Look at that.

970
00:56:17,709 --> 00:56:19,001
It looks great, you're gonna like it.

971
00:56:19,002 --> 00:56:20,169
(screeching)

972
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:21,837
[Trudy] Looks so interesting.

973
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:25,967
You only dislike it if
you hate delicious things.

974
00:56:27,177 --> 00:56:31,306
(group chattering)
(ominous hum)

975
00:56:37,645 --> 00:56:39,104
[Leonard] Harvest cake, huh?

976
00:56:39,105 --> 00:56:40,356
We have to get this recipe.
- It sounds so quaint,

977
00:56:40,357 --> 00:56:41,774
doesn't it?

978
00:56:41,775 --> 00:56:44,109
Did you hear something?

979
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:45,110
No.

980
00:56:45,111 --> 00:56:46,445
You okay?

981
00:56:46,446 --> 00:56:47,654
[Trudy] Tasty.

982
00:56:47,655 --> 00:56:49,573
- I like it a lot.
- I do like it.

983
00:56:49,574 --> 00:56:50,908
- Mm-hm.
- Mm!

984
00:56:50,909 --> 00:56:53,494
You know, Mom, when you
say we met on the internet,

985
00:56:53,495 --> 00:56:54,787
it's a little misleading.
(gasps)

986
00:56:54,788 --> 00:56:58,207
(ominous orchestral music)

987
00:56:58,208 --> 00:57:00,668
(loud squish)

988
00:57:06,674 --> 00:57:10,804
(screeching)
(gasps)

989
00:57:12,555 --> 00:57:13,639
(loud squish)
(screeches)

990
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,598
(gasps)
- Well, you need to do that

991
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:16,225
to find a good mate.

992
00:57:16,226 --> 00:57:17,601
- She has a Facebook.
- You can't even trust

993
00:57:17,602 --> 00:57:20,104
the things you hear or that
people write about themselves.

994
00:57:20,105 --> 00:57:21,230
- Very nice.
- Even the pictures are

995
00:57:21,231 --> 00:57:22,272
false half the time.

996
00:57:22,273 --> 00:57:24,066
Is that true?
- Oh, it's true.

997
00:57:24,067 --> 00:57:25,901
I don't think it's a
misconception to think

998
00:57:25,902 --> 00:57:28,862
that people of good breeding
and success should be able

999
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:32,866
to meet potential life partners
in a realistic situation.

1000
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:35,745
(high-pitched hum)

1001
00:57:38,289 --> 00:57:40,500
(mumbling)

1002
00:57:42,794 --> 00:57:44,504
Would you, Christine?

1003
00:57:46,923 --> 00:57:47,923
No.

1004
00:57:47,924 --> 00:57:49,049
No, of course not.

1005
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:50,008
What?

1006
00:57:50,009 --> 00:57:51,760
What, but we did.

1007
00:57:51,761 --> 00:57:53,053
We met at a bar, Chris.

1008
00:57:53,054 --> 00:57:53,929
What are you talking about?

1009
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:55,556
Oh, my God, that's right.

1010
00:57:55,557 --> 00:57:57,141
You two better get
your stories straight.

1011
00:57:57,142 --> 00:57:59,101
It's not a Klan rally, Mom.

1012
00:57:59,102 --> 00:58:00,394
It's a bar.

1013
00:58:00,395 --> 00:58:01,645
(Leonard laughs)

1014
00:58:01,646 --> 00:58:03,440
Yeah, we met at a bar,

1015
00:58:04,357 --> 00:58:05,691
and we set up the date on the internet.

1016
00:58:05,692 --> 00:58:07,276
(coughing)

1017
00:58:07,277 --> 00:58:08,861
You okay?

1018
00:58:08,862 --> 00:58:09,695
(coughing)

1019
00:58:09,696 --> 00:58:10,529
You okay?

1020
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:11,613
(coughing)
Want water?

1021
00:58:11,614 --> 00:58:15,367
Baby, have some, went down the wrong pipe.

1022
00:58:15,368 --> 00:58:16,201
(loud pop)
(fly buzzing)

1023
00:58:16,202 --> 00:58:17,245
Oh, my God!

1024
00:58:22,792 --> 00:58:24,836
(coughs)

1025
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,382
I'm sorry, I don't, uh,

1026
00:58:30,383 --> 00:58:32,926
there must be a window open.
(high-pitched screeching)

1027
00:58:32,927 --> 00:58:34,386
Chris?
(loud thudding)

1028
00:58:34,387 --> 00:58:36,681
(shrieking)

1029
00:58:38,141 --> 00:58:40,934
(loud crash)
- Okay, I hear you!

1030
00:58:40,935 --> 00:58:41,935
Leave me alone!

1031
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:43,770
Just leave me the hell alone!

1032
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:44,605
[Clay] Stop it!

1033
00:58:44,606 --> 00:58:46,816
Baby, there's no one there.

1034
00:58:49,235 --> 00:58:50,028
Okay.

1035
00:58:52,697 --> 00:58:54,406
I think I'd better go.

1036
00:58:54,407 --> 00:58:57,618
Yes, I think that would be best.

1037
00:58:57,619 --> 00:58:59,161
- Wait, Chris.
- Don't follow her.

1038
00:58:59,162 --> 00:59:00,537
She's a sick girl.

1039
00:59:00,538 --> 00:59:01,955
Mom, she needs my help.

1040
00:59:01,956 --> 00:59:02,999
Let her go.

1041
00:59:04,709 --> 00:59:07,669
(loud crash)
- Wait!

1042
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:08,629
What's the matter?

1043
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:10,088
(groans)
(loud crash)

1044
00:59:10,089 --> 00:59:12,466
Look, I did what you said!

1045
00:59:12,467 --> 00:59:14,593
I killed that little kitty!

1046
00:59:14,594 --> 00:59:16,428
You're so full of shit!

1047
00:59:16,429 --> 00:59:19,264
These are elusive and powerful
forces we are dealing with.

1048
00:59:19,265 --> 00:59:21,226
There are no guarantees!

1049
00:59:38,743 --> 00:59:42,246
We must speak directly
to this dark spirit.

1050
00:59:42,247 --> 00:59:47,084
We must dissuade it from
taking your soul, and soon.

1051
00:59:47,085 --> 00:59:48,627
I know someone who can help us.

1052
00:59:48,628 --> 00:59:50,921
And I'm supposed to trust you?

1053
00:59:50,922 --> 00:59:53,090
Tomorrow is the third day.

1054
00:59:53,091 --> 00:59:55,300
After that, the Lamia will come for you.

1055
00:59:55,301 --> 00:59:57,344
We can't let that happen.

1056
00:59:57,345 --> 00:59:59,429
But you must understand,

1057
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:03,433
the woman who can help us must
put herself at great risk.

1058
01:00:03,434 --> 01:00:05,561
She will not do that for free.

1059
01:00:05,562 --> 01:00:07,229
What do you need from me?

1060
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:09,607
$10,000, cash, by tomorrow.

1061
01:00:25,748 --> 01:00:26,915
Mr. Jacks.

1062
01:00:26,916 --> 01:00:28,250
Yeah?

1063
01:00:28,251 --> 01:00:30,711
This is kind of awkward for me,

1064
01:00:30,712 --> 01:00:33,505
and I know it's not official yet,

1065
01:00:33,506 --> 01:00:35,924
but I was wondering if
I could get an advance

1066
01:00:35,925 --> 01:00:37,259
for the new position.

1067
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:39,720
What, the assistant manager's position?

1068
01:00:39,721 --> 01:00:40,887
Yes.

1069
01:00:40,888 --> 01:00:44,349
See, one of my family
members is really sick.

1070
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:46,018
They're not gonna die,

1071
01:00:46,019 --> 01:00:47,477
but they could.
- Christine, Christine.

1072
01:00:47,478 --> 01:00:49,271
There's a problem.

1073
01:00:49,272 --> 01:00:52,107
The McPherson deal was
canceled last night.

1074
01:00:52,108 --> 01:00:53,067
What?
- Yeah.

1075
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:56,028
Right after I informed the regional office

1076
01:00:56,029 --> 01:00:58,030
that we had this big loan pending,

1077
01:00:58,031 --> 01:00:59,489
I find out that they just made their deal

1078
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:01,658
over at First National.

1079
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:03,702
Now, I gotta call in to
see what exactly happened,

1080
01:01:03,703 --> 01:01:06,288
but right now, this does not look

1081
01:01:06,289 --> 01:01:09,166
too good for you or for me.

1082
01:01:09,167 --> 01:01:13,296
So, this assistant manager
promotion has been delayed.

1083
01:01:14,589 --> 01:01:16,048
In fact, you know, I think,

1084
01:01:16,049 --> 01:01:17,633
with everything that's been happening,

1085
01:01:17,634 --> 01:01:21,845
I think I'm gonna have
to give this job to Stu.

1086
01:01:21,846 --> 01:01:22,846
Stu.

1087
01:01:22,847 --> 01:01:23,640
I see.

1088
01:01:24,557 --> 01:01:25,474
I'm sorry.

1089
01:01:25,475 --> 01:01:27,267
Look, if you've got family problems,

1090
01:01:27,268 --> 01:01:31,397
maybe you should take the
day off, sort them out and...

1091
01:01:54,045 --> 01:01:56,880
(screams)

1092
01:01:56,881 --> 01:01:58,799
(loud thud)
(groans)

1093
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,300
(screams)

1094
01:02:00,301 --> 01:02:02,386
(loud squish)

1095
01:02:02,387 --> 01:02:03,970
(screeches)

1096
01:02:03,971 --> 01:02:07,684
(thrilling orchestral music)

1097
01:02:10,019 --> 01:02:11,395
(wooden creak)

1098
01:02:11,396 --> 01:02:12,979
(metallic clang)

1099
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:15,024
(groans)

1100
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:19,611
(screams)

1101
01:02:19,612 --> 01:02:20,487
(loud squish)

1102
01:02:20,488 --> 01:02:22,155
(screams)

1103
01:02:22,156 --> 01:02:24,700
(loud clang)

1104
01:02:24,701 --> 01:02:27,328
(bird chirping)

1105
01:02:37,088 --> 01:02:38,880
(register whirs)

1106
01:02:38,881 --> 01:02:40,298
So, how much?

1107
01:02:40,299 --> 01:02:42,551
3,800 for everything.

1108
01:02:42,552 --> 01:02:44,052
Including my jewelry?

1109
01:02:44,053 --> 01:02:45,095
Including.

1110
01:02:45,096 --> 01:02:48,223
But this stuff is worth
so much more than that.

1111
01:02:48,224 --> 01:02:49,266
Please.

1112
01:02:49,267 --> 01:02:50,809
This is all I have.

1113
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:52,103
I'm begging you.

1114
01:02:53,688 --> 01:02:56,148
Take it or leave it.

1115
01:02:56,149 --> 01:02:58,108
(crying)

1116
01:02:58,109 --> 01:03:01,571
(somber orchestral music)

1117
01:03:04,073 --> 01:03:05,532
(knocking)
- Chris?

1118
01:03:05,533 --> 01:03:06,284
Chris?

1119
01:03:09,454 --> 01:03:10,246
Baby?

1120
01:03:29,891 --> 01:03:32,852
Thought you were lactose intolerant.

1121
01:03:33,811 --> 01:03:34,604
I am.

1122
01:03:36,147 --> 01:03:40,234
But then I thought, screw
it, I'm eating ice cream.

1123
01:03:42,653 --> 01:03:44,113
I paid Rham Jas.

1124
01:03:47,867 --> 01:03:48,659
What?

1125
01:03:49,994 --> 01:03:51,787
You're kidding me.

1126
01:03:51,788 --> 01:03:52,830
I paid him.

1127
01:03:54,248 --> 01:03:58,043
Why, I mean, I thought
that you didn't believe.

1128
01:03:58,044 --> 01:04:00,837
I don't know what I believe in anymore.

1129
01:04:00,838 --> 01:04:05,759
I really don't, but I know
that you believe in this.

1130
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,511
I know how important it is to you,

1131
01:04:07,512 --> 01:04:11,224
and I know how much pain
this is causing you.

1132
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:14,227
And, I also remembered,

1133
01:04:16,771 --> 01:04:19,565
I remembered a promise that I made

1134
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:23,193
the night I fell in love with you.

1135
01:04:23,194 --> 01:04:27,281
I told myself that I would
always look out for you.

1136
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:30,952
I'd always take care of you.

1137
01:04:31,953 --> 01:04:33,079
So I paid him.

1138
01:04:36,541 --> 01:04:39,543
You remember the night that
you fell in love with me?

1139
01:04:39,544 --> 01:04:44,256
I remember the second
I fell in love with you.

1140
01:04:44,257 --> 01:04:45,299
Oh, my God.

1141
01:04:58,729 --> 01:05:01,106
You sure you don't want
me to go in with you?

1142
01:05:01,107 --> 01:05:02,482
He said I should come alone.

1143
01:05:02,483 --> 01:05:03,316
Yeah, I know, I know.

1144
01:05:03,317 --> 01:05:05,444
He told me the same thing.

1145
01:05:12,702 --> 01:05:15,579
(ominous orchestral music)

1146
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:18,124
(wind blowing)

1147
01:05:42,148 --> 01:05:44,274
Christine, if you will
permit me the pleasure

1148
01:05:44,275 --> 01:05:47,153
of an introduction, Shaun San Dena.

1149
01:05:50,656 --> 01:05:52,198
Welcome.

1150
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:53,992
[Christine] How do you do?

1151
01:05:53,993 --> 01:05:56,411
Shaun San Dena is an experienced medium.

1152
01:05:56,412 --> 01:05:59,664
Furthermore, she's personally
been touched by the Lamia.

1153
01:05:59,665 --> 01:06:03,084
I first encountered
this spirit many years ago

1154
01:06:03,085 --> 01:06:05,378
in this very house.

1155
01:06:05,379 --> 01:06:07,047
And what happened?

1156
01:06:07,048 --> 01:06:09,341
(boy screaming)

1157
01:06:09,342 --> 01:06:12,720
I lost a young boy's soul to the beast.

1158
01:06:14,055 --> 01:06:16,515
(boy screams)

1159
01:06:19,477 --> 01:06:21,938
I have waited these long years

1160
01:06:24,398 --> 01:06:27,109
for a chance at redeeming myself,

1161
01:06:28,486 --> 01:06:32,072
a chance to destroy the foul thing.

1162
01:06:32,073 --> 01:06:34,116
And--
- Tetiechko, please.

1163
01:06:39,413 --> 01:06:41,958
Tonight, my chance will come.

1164
01:06:43,751 --> 01:06:47,046
But to summon it, I will need your help.

1165
01:06:48,756 --> 01:06:50,216
Can you be strong?

1166
01:06:53,302 --> 01:06:54,178
I'll try.

1167
01:06:59,767 --> 01:07:03,353
My late husband,
Sandor, was also medium.

1168
01:07:03,354 --> 01:07:05,397
He chose this site to build a house upon

1169
01:07:05,398 --> 01:07:09,193
because he sensed certain
forces at work here.

1170
01:07:10,611 --> 01:07:13,572
In this place, there is a particular

1171
01:07:15,324 --> 01:07:19,286
(speaking in foreign language).

1172
01:07:22,832 --> 01:07:25,583
A particular confluence of
forces which allows a doorway

1173
01:07:25,584 --> 01:07:28,211
to be opened through which we may pass.

1174
01:07:28,212 --> 01:07:32,716
(speaking in foreign language)

1175
01:07:32,717 --> 01:07:35,385
And through which others
may pass into our world.

1176
01:07:35,386 --> 01:07:38,931
(ominous orchestral music)

1177
01:07:41,642 --> 01:07:43,853
[Shaun] Please be seated.

1178
01:08:01,996 --> 01:08:06,125
(goat bleating)
(shrieks)

1179
01:08:11,714 --> 01:08:12,797
What's going on?

1180
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:15,175
Everything we're doing
is for your own good.

1181
01:08:15,176 --> 01:08:15,968
Please.

1182
01:08:16,969 --> 01:08:18,429
Christine, please.

1183
01:08:24,185 --> 01:08:24,977
Thank you.

1184
01:08:44,246 --> 01:08:48,084
(speaking in foreign language)

1185
01:08:55,549 --> 01:09:00,011
Once the spirit has entered me,
put my hand upon the animal.

1186
01:09:00,012 --> 01:09:01,721
Do you understand?

1187
01:09:01,722 --> 01:09:03,223
Yes.

1188
01:09:03,224 --> 01:09:06,810
I force the spirit of
the Lamia into the goat.

1189
01:09:06,811 --> 01:09:09,687
Milos, that's when you strike.

1190
01:09:09,688 --> 01:09:10,522
Si, Tetiechko.

1191
01:09:10,523 --> 01:09:12,440
(speaking in foreign language)

1192
01:09:12,441 --> 01:09:13,442
I understand.

1193
01:09:24,703 --> 01:09:26,914
We all must be receptive.

1194
01:09:35,339 --> 01:09:39,218
(speaking in foreign language)

1195
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:43,429
What am I supposed to do?

1196
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:45,640
You must allow the darkness in.

1197
01:09:45,641 --> 01:09:50,228
You must invite the dead to
co-mingle with your spirit.

1198
01:09:50,229 --> 01:09:51,813
I'm scared.

1199
01:09:51,814 --> 01:09:53,231
Yes.

1200
01:09:53,232 --> 01:09:57,652
Now repeat these words: I
welcome the dead into my soul.

1201
01:09:57,653 --> 01:10:01,614
(speaking in foreign language)

1202
01:10:01,615 --> 01:10:03,366
I welcome the dead into my soul.

1203
01:10:03,367 --> 01:10:05,869
You must believe it!

1204
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:08,497
I welcome the dead into my soul.

1205
01:10:09,915 --> 01:10:13,126
[Both] I welcome the dead into my soul.

1206
01:10:13,127 --> 01:10:14,127
(speaking in foreign language)

1207
01:10:14,128 --> 01:10:23,178
I welcome the dead into my soul.

1208
01:10:23,179 --> 01:10:31,936
I welcome the dead into my soul!

1209
01:10:31,937 --> 01:10:33,146
(gasps)

1210
01:10:33,147 --> 01:10:36,649
(shouting in foreign language)

1211
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:42,488
I welcome the dead into my soul!

1212
01:10:42,489 --> 01:10:43,656
I welcome the dead into my--

1213
01:10:43,657 --> 01:10:45,618
(gasps)

1214
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:50,331
Something else is here with us.

1215
01:10:51,582 --> 01:10:52,374
Yes.

1216
01:10:53,709 --> 01:10:56,337
(loud tinkling)

1217
01:10:58,505 --> 01:10:59,923
(soft tinkling)

1218
01:10:59,924 --> 01:11:02,550
(laughing)

1219
01:11:02,551 --> 01:11:03,384
(shrieks)
(loud crash)

1220
01:11:03,385 --> 01:11:05,470
(laughing)

1221
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:08,265
(drapes rustling)

1222
01:11:16,232 --> 01:11:18,776
(wind blowing)

1223
01:11:21,195 --> 01:11:23,321
It is not the Lamia.

1224
01:11:23,322 --> 01:11:27,451
It is the spirit of some
unsettled soul from years ago.

1225
01:11:31,497 --> 01:11:35,541
Sometimes the unsettled
ones linger by the door.

1226
01:11:35,542 --> 01:11:38,254
There are others here, as well.

1227
01:11:40,798 --> 01:11:42,507
(screeches)

1228
01:11:42,508 --> 01:11:44,551
(growls)

1229
01:11:48,681 --> 01:11:50,765
Begone, foolish spirits!

1230
01:11:50,766 --> 01:11:51,975
Begone!

1231
01:11:51,976 --> 01:11:55,561
(shouting in foreign language)
(screams)

1232
01:11:55,562 --> 01:11:57,773
(loud hum)

1233
01:12:05,155 --> 01:12:06,282
She is coming.

1234
01:12:18,377 --> 01:12:22,256
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1235
01:12:32,433 --> 01:12:35,060
(door rattling)

1236
01:12:38,063 --> 01:12:39,731
(loud thud)

1237
01:12:39,732 --> 01:12:41,859
(banging)

1238
01:12:47,573 --> 01:12:49,783
(jingling)

1239
01:12:57,249 --> 01:12:59,543
(screaming)

1240
01:13:26,862 --> 01:13:29,864
(screeching)

1241
01:13:29,865 --> 01:13:32,492
(loud thud)
(groans)

1242
01:13:32,493 --> 01:13:34,703
(groaning)

1243
01:13:49,843 --> 01:13:53,639
Who now inhabits the
body of Shaun San Dena?

1244
01:13:56,934 --> 01:13:57,726
Lamia.

1245
01:14:06,068 --> 01:14:08,194
Lamia, what is it you desire?

1246
01:14:08,195 --> 01:14:11,407
I desire the soul of Christine Brown!

1247
01:14:12,825 --> 01:14:16,661
We will feast upon it as
she festers in the grave!

1248
01:14:16,662 --> 01:14:17,495
No!

1249
01:14:17,496 --> 01:14:19,247
It was my manager, Jim Jacks!

1250
01:14:19,248 --> 01:14:21,124
He was the one!
- Silence!

1251
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:23,251
Lamia, surely you can be dissuaded

1252
01:14:23,252 --> 01:14:25,503
from taking this insignificant woman.

1253
01:14:25,504 --> 01:14:28,631
Surely she is not worthy
of your greatness.

1254
01:14:28,632 --> 01:14:30,801
(laughing)

1255
01:14:37,391 --> 01:14:38,183
No!

1256
01:14:42,771 --> 01:14:44,898
I come for you, Christine.

1257
01:14:46,191 --> 01:14:48,359
(goat bleats)

1258
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,069
You're mine!

1259
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:51,112
(screams)
(loud thud)

1260
01:14:51,113 --> 01:14:52,280
(goat bleats)

1261
01:14:52,281 --> 01:14:53,322
(gasps)

1262
01:14:53,323 --> 01:14:55,032
(screams)

1263
01:14:55,033 --> 01:14:55,908
No!

1264
01:14:55,909 --> 01:14:57,869
You tricked me!

1265
01:14:57,870 --> 01:15:00,455
You black-hearted whore!

1266
01:15:00,456 --> 01:15:01,330
Now, Milos, now!

1267
01:15:01,331 --> 01:15:02,291
You bitch!

1268
01:15:03,584 --> 01:15:06,210
(grunts)

1269
01:15:06,211 --> 01:15:08,338
(screams)

1270
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:13,259
(roars)
(screams)

1271
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:16,304
(speaking in foreign language)

1272
01:15:16,305 --> 01:15:18,182
Away, unclean spirit!

1273
01:15:19,141 --> 01:15:21,476
(laughing)

1274
01:15:21,477 --> 01:15:23,227
(groans)

1275
01:15:23,228 --> 01:15:27,316
(laughing)
(lively orchestral music)

1276
01:15:29,776 --> 01:15:32,154
(loud crash)

1277
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:35,823
Lamia!

1278
01:15:35,824 --> 01:15:37,783
As one who summoned you to this circle,

1279
01:15:37,784 --> 01:15:39,535
I command you to leave this instant!

1280
01:15:39,536 --> 01:15:40,495
(growls)

1281
01:15:40,496 --> 01:15:43,122
(loud crash)

1282
01:15:43,123 --> 01:15:46,876
(speaking in foreign language)

1283
01:15:46,877 --> 01:15:47,836
Christine!

1284
01:15:54,134 --> 01:15:54,967
(screams)

1285
01:15:54,968 --> 01:15:58,597
I don't want your cat,
you dirty pork queen!

1286
01:16:03,018 --> 01:16:05,229
(cat mews)

1287
01:16:07,481 --> 01:16:09,525
(groans)

1288
01:16:11,109 --> 01:16:13,027
[Rham] Shaun San Dena!

1289
01:16:13,028 --> 01:16:15,905
- Si.
- You must banish the spirit!

1290
01:16:15,906 --> 01:16:17,031
Yes!

1291
01:16:17,032 --> 01:16:19,242
(screeching)

1292
01:16:19,243 --> 01:16:23,372
(shouting in foreign language)
(screaming)

1293
01:16:46,562 --> 01:16:49,021
(loud crash)

1294
01:16:49,022 --> 01:16:50,232
[Rham] Milos!

1295
01:16:51,108 --> 01:16:52,984
Oh, my God.

1296
01:16:52,985 --> 01:16:53,818
I'm okay.

1297
01:16:53,819 --> 01:16:54,986
Thank God!

1298
01:16:54,987 --> 01:16:55,945
[Milos] I'm okay.

1299
01:16:55,946 --> 01:16:59,532
Unbelievable!
(laughs)

1300
01:16:59,533 --> 01:17:00,741
[Christine] You did it!

1301
01:17:00,742 --> 01:17:02,286
[Rham] Thank God.

1302
01:17:03,745 --> 01:17:04,538
I tried.

1303
01:17:05,455 --> 01:17:06,998
Are you okay?

1304
01:17:06,999 --> 01:17:08,124
Oh, my God.

1305
01:17:08,125 --> 01:17:08,917
Help me!

1306
01:17:10,586 --> 01:17:12,796
(groaning)

1307
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:15,507
Call an ambulance.

1308
01:17:19,428 --> 01:17:20,971
Is she breathing?

1309
01:17:22,598 --> 01:17:23,557
[Rham] No.

1310
01:17:27,144 --> 01:17:28,270
Oh, my gosh.

1311
01:17:40,782 --> 01:17:44,244
(somber orchestral music)

1312
01:18:09,978 --> 01:18:11,562
It's so sad.

1313
01:18:11,563 --> 01:18:13,105
Yes.

1314
01:18:13,106 --> 01:18:15,441
Strange how things work out.

1315
01:18:15,442 --> 01:18:17,693
She waited 40 years for another chance

1316
01:18:17,694 --> 01:18:19,488
to overcome the Lamia,

1317
01:18:21,156 --> 01:18:25,285
and finally, on the last
night of her life, she did.

1318
01:18:26,662 --> 01:18:29,539
No, I'm afraid you misunderstand.

1319
01:18:30,499 --> 01:18:33,709
The Lamia cannot be banished by a medium.

1320
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:35,878
This is our lesson tonight.

1321
01:18:35,879 --> 01:18:36,754
I'm sorry.

1322
01:18:36,755 --> 01:18:38,047
But I saw her get rid

1323
01:18:38,048 --> 01:18:38,881
of the thing.
- No.

1324
01:18:38,882 --> 01:18:41,509
You saw her drive it from a seance.

1325
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:42,802
That is all.

1326
01:18:42,803 --> 01:18:44,136
It will be back.

1327
01:18:44,137 --> 01:18:46,681
The goat was never slaughtered.

1328
01:18:46,682 --> 01:18:49,558
When this night is through,

1329
01:18:49,559 --> 01:18:53,689
the Lamia will come for the
owner of the accursed object.

1330
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:59,694
Unless, of course, you
are no longer the owner.

1331
01:18:59,695 --> 01:19:01,571
Do you have the button?

1332
01:19:09,496 --> 01:19:13,583
Make a gift of it and
you've given the curse away.

1333
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,629
Why didn't you tell me this before?

1334
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:20,256
Because the Lamia will tear the soul

1335
01:19:20,257 --> 01:19:22,383
out of whoever you give that to.

1336
01:19:22,384 --> 01:19:25,178
They'll burn in hell for eternity.

1337
01:19:26,763 --> 01:19:30,349
And I would have sent them there.

1338
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:32,728
I would be your accomplice.

1339
01:19:34,187 --> 01:19:37,733
Whatever you decide,
you have till morning.

1340
01:19:39,693 --> 01:19:43,238
(ominous orchestral music)

1341
01:19:59,087 --> 01:20:00,130
Is it over?

1342
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:02,799
It's over.

1343
01:20:06,887 --> 01:20:08,012
Clay!

1344
01:20:08,013 --> 01:20:10,640
(tires screech)

1345
01:20:12,684 --> 01:20:14,935
You will burn in hell!

1346
01:20:14,936 --> 01:20:17,229
You will burn in hell!

1347
01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:20,191
You bitch, you'll burn in hell!

1348
01:20:20,192 --> 01:20:22,485
Your turn's coming!

1349
01:20:22,486 --> 01:20:24,028
You will burn in hell!

1350
01:20:24,029 --> 01:20:24,905
You okay?

1351
01:20:25,989 --> 01:20:26,782
Holy shit.

1352
01:20:29,951 --> 01:20:31,912
(sighs)

1353
01:20:41,838 --> 01:20:42,797
Okay, you sure you're still okay

1354
01:20:42,798 --> 01:20:43,756
about the Santa Barbara trip?

1355
01:20:43,757 --> 01:20:44,715
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah?

1356
01:20:44,716 --> 01:20:46,342
And what time should I get you?

1357
01:20:46,343 --> 01:20:48,928
It's better if I meet
you at the station.

1358
01:20:48,929 --> 01:20:50,846
There's something I've
gotta do on the way.

1359
01:20:50,847 --> 01:20:52,598
I can do it, you want
me to do it on my way to--

1360
01:20:52,599 --> 01:20:53,599
No! No.

1361
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,935
I've got it under control.

1362
01:20:55,936 --> 01:20:56,977
Meet at, like, 7:30 at--

1363
01:20:56,978 --> 01:20:58,771
Wait! Where's my envelope?

1364
01:20:58,772 --> 01:21:00,064
- What envelope?
- It was in my purse.

1365
01:21:00,065 --> 01:21:01,398
I just had it!

1366
01:21:01,399 --> 01:21:03,526
It's just an envelope.
- No, it's gotta be here!

1367
01:21:03,527 --> 01:21:06,695
It's here, so we'll find it eventually.

1368
01:21:06,696 --> 01:21:08,072
(sighs)
- Oh, my God.

1369
01:21:08,073 --> 01:21:10,616
- Okay.
- I thought I'd lost it.

1370
01:21:10,617 --> 01:21:11,409
Okay.

1371
01:21:12,410 --> 01:21:13,244
Bye.
- 7:30.

1372
01:21:13,245 --> 01:21:14,371
Don't be late.

1373
01:21:15,956 --> 01:21:19,501
(ominous orchestral music)

1374
01:21:28,593 --> 01:21:30,720
(tapping)

1375
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:35,516
[Boy] Dad, can we go to the Angel game?

1376
01:21:35,517 --> 01:21:37,059
What about the Dodgers?

1377
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:39,228
We're only gonna be
in town for a few days.

1378
01:21:39,229 --> 01:21:41,897
But if there's a home game...

1379
01:21:41,898 --> 01:21:45,317
I'm sure if I just tell him
how much I care about you,

1380
01:21:45,318 --> 01:21:46,569
I mean, he's gotta understand.

1381
01:21:46,570 --> 01:21:50,115
(elegant orchestral music)

1382
01:21:51,491 --> 01:21:53,909
[Waitress] Are you sure
you don't want anything else?

1383
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:54,743
No.

1384
01:21:54,744 --> 01:21:55,578
So you're just gonna sit

1385
01:21:55,579 --> 01:21:58,038
here drinking coffee all night long?

1386
01:21:58,039 --> 01:21:58,832
Yes.

1387
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:01,333
Maybe! What's it to you?

1388
01:22:01,334 --> 01:22:03,586
Honey, I make my money on tips.

1389
01:22:03,587 --> 01:22:05,629
Coffee drinkers don't tip.

1390
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:07,172
Honey, just keep the coffee coming

1391
01:22:07,173 --> 01:22:10,468
or I'll give you a tip you won't forget.

1392
01:22:51,384 --> 01:22:52,801
Oh, my gosh.

1393
01:22:52,802 --> 01:22:55,846
What a delightful surprise.

1394
01:22:55,847 --> 01:22:58,807
Well, you're the sweetest
person in the world.

1395
01:22:58,808 --> 01:23:01,560
(woman chuckles)

1396
01:23:01,561 --> 01:23:03,270
Never mind what it's about, Stu.

1397
01:23:03,271 --> 01:23:04,271
Just get here in 10 minutes

1398
01:23:04,272 --> 01:23:05,564
or I'm gonna tell Mr. Jacks something

1399
01:23:05,565 --> 01:23:07,650
you don't want me to tell him.

1400
01:23:07,651 --> 01:23:09,234
[Stu] Oh, yeah?

1401
01:23:09,235 --> 01:23:10,235
Like what?

1402
01:23:10,236 --> 01:23:13,280
Well, for starters, that you
stole the McPherson loan file

1403
01:23:13,281 --> 01:23:16,450
off my desk and gave it to First National.

1404
01:23:16,451 --> 01:23:17,826
Now you got nine minutes!

1405
01:23:17,827 --> 01:23:21,373
(elegant orchestral music)

1406
01:23:22,415 --> 01:23:23,666
Give me another.

1407
01:23:23,667 --> 01:23:24,626
Seriously?

1408
01:23:33,093 --> 01:23:35,761
Oh, God, Christine,
please don't tell on me.

1409
01:23:35,762 --> 01:23:37,805
I mean, if my dad ever finds out,

1410
01:23:37,806 --> 01:23:39,098
just tell me what you want.

1411
01:23:39,099 --> 01:23:41,183
I need to give something to you.

1412
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:42,518
A little gift.

1413
01:23:42,519 --> 01:23:43,311
A gift?

1414
01:23:44,813 --> 01:23:46,146
But I don't understand.

1415
01:23:46,147 --> 01:23:47,106
I thought you called me down here

1416
01:23:47,107 --> 01:23:49,108
because I gave that
loan to First National.

1417
01:23:49,109 --> 01:23:50,442
Look, you don't need to understand!

1418
01:23:50,443 --> 01:23:51,444
Just shut up!

1419
01:23:54,197 --> 01:23:55,572
Now, this gift that I'm giving you,

1420
01:23:55,573 --> 01:23:56,740
it'll become your property.

1421
01:23:56,741 --> 01:23:59,285
You'll be the owner, all right?

1422
01:24:02,163 --> 01:24:02,956
Okay.

1423
01:24:08,670 --> 01:24:09,462
Okay.

1424
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:13,132
(sighs)

1425
01:24:13,133 --> 01:24:13,925
What?

1426
01:24:15,844 --> 01:24:16,803
Forget it.

1427
01:24:18,263 --> 01:24:19,471
But I thought you wanted to give it to me

1428
01:24:19,472 --> 01:24:20,389
'cause of the loan stuff.

1429
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:21,433
Just leave.

1430
01:24:24,936 --> 01:24:26,270
Okay.

1431
01:24:26,271 --> 01:24:28,648
Thank you so much, Christine.

1432
01:24:30,942 --> 01:24:32,902
(sighs)

1433
01:24:34,654 --> 01:24:35,863
But you're not gonna tell my dad, right?

1434
01:24:35,864 --> 01:24:36,656
Go!
- Okay.

1435
01:24:48,251 --> 01:24:50,211
Who does deserve this?

1436
01:24:55,967 --> 01:24:59,846
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1437
01:25:11,274 --> 01:25:12,149
Well?

1438
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:13,359
Is it possible?

1439
01:25:14,569 --> 01:25:17,738
There are gypsy blessings
bestowed upon the dead.

1440
01:25:17,739 --> 01:25:19,740
They give gifts to their departed

1441
01:25:19,741 --> 01:25:22,242
to curry favor with the deceased's soul,

1442
01:25:22,243 --> 01:25:24,871
for, truly, the soul never dies.

1443
01:25:26,206 --> 01:25:27,790
Yes.

1444
01:25:27,791 --> 01:25:29,374
I do believe you can give the curse

1445
01:25:29,375 --> 01:25:31,460
to someone who has passed on,

1446
01:25:31,461 --> 01:25:32,920
but you must make a formal gift

1447
01:25:32,921 --> 01:25:34,963
of the accursed object to the deceased.

1448
01:25:34,964 --> 01:25:36,757
Oh, I'll do better than that.

1449
01:25:36,758 --> 01:25:39,384
I'll shove it down her goddamn throat!

1450
01:25:39,385 --> 01:25:40,761
I'm gonna get some.

1451
01:25:40,762 --> 01:25:42,137
(screeches)

1452
01:25:42,138 --> 01:25:44,099
(gasps)

1453
01:26:02,033 --> 01:26:03,909
(tires screech)

1454
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:05,702
(groaning)

1455
01:26:05,703 --> 01:26:07,788
(tires screech)

1456
01:26:07,789 --> 01:26:09,206

(casket creaking)
(grunting)

1468
01:27:27,619 --> 01:27:29,704
I'm giving it back to you!

1469
01:27:31,456 --> 01:27:33,833
You're gonna take this thing!

1470
01:27:35,293 --> 01:27:37,754
Are you gonna take this thing?

1471
01:27:39,005 --> 01:27:40,172
(grunts)

1472
01:27:40,173 --> 01:27:40,965
Take it!

1473
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:45,344
(loud roar)
(screams)

1474
01:27:45,345 --> 01:27:46,553

(groans)

1478
01:27:54,812 --> 01:27:58,023
That's the last of my hair you're getting!

1479
01:27:58,024 --> 01:28:00,068
(grunts)

1480
01:28:03,112 --> 01:28:04,656
I, Christine Brown,

1481
01:28:05,990 --> 01:28:08,116
do hereby make a formal gift

1482
01:28:08,117 --> 01:28:11,162
of this button to you, Sylvia Ganush!

1483
01:28:12,372 --> 01:28:13,413
(grunts)

1484
01:28:13,414 --> 01:28:14,958
Choke on it, bitch!

1485
01:28:30,348 --> 01:28:31,140
Goodbye.

1486
01:28:34,477 --> 01:28:36,688
(grunting)

1487
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:43,027

(gasping)

1494
01:29:58,269 --> 01:30:01,104
(phone ringing)

1495
01:30:01,105 --> 01:30:02,064
[Phone] Hi, it's Christine.

1496
01:30:02,065 --> 01:30:04,816
Leave a message and I'll call you back.

1497
01:30:04,817 --> 01:30:07,319
[Jim] Christine, it's Jim, Jim Jacks.

1498
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:09,321
I'm sorry I'm calling so
early, but last night,

1499
01:30:09,322 --> 01:30:11,156
I found some troubling information

1500
01:30:11,157 --> 01:30:13,575
about our friend Stu Rubin.

1501
01:30:13,576 --> 01:30:17,079
Apparently, he stole your
file on the McPherson loan

1502
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:20,624
and then tried to broker his
own deal at First National.

1503
01:30:20,625 --> 01:30:22,501
I guess he thought we wouldn't find out.

1504
01:30:22,502 --> 01:30:25,295
And we wouldn't have, either,
except that an hour ago,

1505
01:30:25,296 --> 01:30:30,175
he came by my house and tried
to pin the whole thing on you.

1506
01:30:30,176 --> 01:30:31,385
After I confronted him

1507
01:30:31,386 --> 01:30:33,762
about a few inconsistencies in his story,

1508
01:30:33,763 --> 01:30:36,139
he broke down crying and, well,

1509
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:39,226
we won't be seeing him around anymore.

1510
01:30:39,227 --> 01:30:42,604
So I just wanted you to know
that, come Monday morning,

1511
01:30:42,605 --> 01:30:46,734
that assistant manager's
position will be waiting for you.

1512
01:30:57,453 --> 01:30:58,328
(train honking)

1513
01:30:58,329 --> 01:31:00,330
[Announcer] Passenger
Benson, please meet your party

1514
01:31:00,331 --> 01:31:02,959
at the concourse ticket counter.

1515
01:31:05,461 --> 01:31:07,045
[Announcer] Welcome to Union Station.

1516
01:31:07,046 --> 01:31:08,630
- Cookie, Miss?
- No, thanks.

1517
01:31:08,631 --> 01:31:11,383
[Announcer] Train travel as
your mode of transportation,

1518
01:31:11,384 --> 01:31:12,968
and we wish you a pleasant journey.

1519
01:31:12,969 --> 01:31:16,514
(elegant orchestral music)

1520
01:31:27,358 --> 01:31:29,317
Hi. Good morning.

1521
01:31:29,318 --> 01:31:32,904
- I'm sorry, we're not open.
- Oh, I just want this coat.

1522
01:31:32,905 --> 01:31:33,780
We're not open yet.

1523
01:31:33,781 --> 01:31:35,031
My boyfriend and I are taking

1524
01:31:35,032 --> 01:31:38,161
this really special trip this morning.

1525
01:31:39,328 --> 01:31:40,121
Please?

1526
01:31:43,207 --> 01:31:46,209
[Announcer] Northbound
Surfliner, service to Van Nuys,

1527
01:31:46,210 --> 01:31:49,588
Simi Valley, Oxnard, Santa Barbara, San--

1528
01:31:49,589 --> 01:31:51,214
[Christine] Clay.

1529
01:31:51,215 --> 01:31:52,132
- Hey.
- Hey!

1530
01:31:52,133 --> 01:31:52,925
Oh, man!

1531
01:31:53,843 --> 01:31:55,760
God, I'm so glad you're
here, so many things

1532
01:31:55,761 --> 01:31:56,636
I wanna tell you.
- Wait, there's something

1533
01:31:56,637 --> 01:31:58,597
I wanna say while I have
it straight in my head.

1534
01:31:58,598 --> 01:32:00,474
Okay. Go ahead.

1535
01:32:00,475 --> 01:32:03,852
You never stopped believing in me.

1536
01:32:03,853 --> 01:32:05,396
Thank you for that.

1537
01:32:06,772 --> 01:32:07,606
And there's something else,

1538
01:32:07,607 --> 01:32:11,068
something that I couldn't admit to before.

1539
01:32:12,111 --> 01:32:14,446
I could have given Mrs. Ganush

1540
01:32:14,447 --> 01:32:18,075
another extension on
her loan, but I didn't.

1541
01:32:19,243 --> 01:32:22,788
It was my decision,
and it was wrong of me.

1542
01:32:32,632 --> 01:32:35,009
You have such a good heart.

1543
01:32:37,303 --> 01:32:39,764
You're so beautiful right now.

1544
01:32:41,349 --> 01:32:42,641
[Christine] Do you like my new coat?

1545
01:32:42,642 --> 01:32:43,808
I do. I really do.

1546
01:32:43,809 --> 01:32:44,809
What happened to the old one, though?

1547
01:32:44,810 --> 01:32:45,644
I threw it out.

1548
01:32:45,645 --> 01:32:47,145
And I never want to see it again.

1549
01:32:47,146 --> 01:32:48,480
Oh, no.

1550
01:32:48,481 --> 01:32:50,649
Oh, that's too bad, 'cause
I, look what I found.

1551
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:52,610
I found this in the car.

1552
01:32:54,654 --> 01:32:57,906
And I thought maybe you could...

1553
01:32:57,907 --> 01:33:00,283
I thought maybe you could sew it back on.

1554
01:33:00,284 --> 01:33:03,620
Yeah, I think you might have
my Standing Liberty quarter,

1555
01:33:03,621 --> 01:33:06,414
'cause the envelopes
kind of look the same.

1556
01:33:06,415 --> 01:33:08,833
Chris, what's wrong?

1557
01:33:08,834 --> 01:33:09,876
(gasps)

1558
01:33:09,877 --> 01:33:13,046
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1559
01:33:13,047 --> 01:33:14,589
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1560
01:33:14,590 --> 01:33:15,465
Stop! Chris!

1561
01:33:15,466 --> 01:33:18,301
(screams)
Oh, God!

1562
01:33:18,302 --> 01:33:19,427
Hey! Hey!

1563
01:33:19,428 --> 01:33:20,387
Hey, hey, no!

1564
01:33:20,388 --> 01:33:21,263
Hey!

1565
01:33:21,264 --> 01:33:22,223
Oh, God, no!

1566
01:33:24,433 --> 01:33:26,142
(train honking)

1567
01:33:26,143 --> 01:33:27,644
(gasps)

1568
01:33:27,645 --> 01:33:28,770
Hey! No!

1569
01:33:28,771 --> 01:33:32,900
(loud crash)
(screaming)

1570
01:33:35,027 --> 01:33:36,403
Help me!

1571
01:33:36,404 --> 01:33:38,863
(screams)

1572
01:33:38,864 --> 01:33:40,949
(groaning)

1573
01:33:40,950 --> 01:33:41,742
Help me!

1574
01:33:43,035 --> 01:33:43,828
Help me!

1575
01:33:45,121 --> 01:33:46,414
Help me, please!

1576
01:34:04,849 --> 01:34:08,352
(ominous orchestral music)

1577
01:35:43,364 --> 01:35:46,492
(somber violin music)

1578
01:36:11,642 --> 01:36:14,937
(frenetic violin music)

1579
01:37:12,787 --> 01:37:16,290
