<i>The Rock has done it!</i>

00:01:23,313 --> 00:01:27,183
The Rock is back

- Yes! Yes!
- Rocky!

13
00:01:30,788 --> 00:01:33,492

Rocky! Rocky!

I'm watching that!

16
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:38,862
I wanna watch <i>Charmed.</i>

17
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:40,665
- No! Give me the remote!
- No!

18
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,499
Give it to me!

19
00:01:42,501 --> 00:01:44,603
- Get off, Zak! Get off!
- Come on! Give it here!

20
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:48,107
Zak! What the bloody hell
do you think you're doing?

21
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:49,473
If you really wanna
choke her out,

22
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:50,675
interlock the fingers.

23
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,178
- Yeah.
- Now pull it tight.

24
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,479
Oh, yeah!

25
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:54,880
Now she's in trouble.
You feel it?

26
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:56,617
- You feel it cut...
- What is going on?

27
00:01:56,619 --> 00:01:58,351
He's choking me!

28
00:01:58,353 --> 00:01:59,786
What're you gonna do about it?

29
00:01:59,788 --> 00:02:02,155
Well, hello. Whoa!

30
00:02:02,157 --> 00:02:04,323
- Yeah, yeah, nice.
- That's my girl.

31
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:06,126
Hey, Saraya.

32
00:02:06,128 --> 00:02:07,862
You don't have to look
pretty today, princess.

33
00:02:07,864 --> 00:02:09,662
Yeah, but she's not just
pretty on the outside, is she?

34
00:02:09,664 --> 00:02:12,699
In there is a heart of gold.
Do anything for anyone.

35
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:14,669
What are you two
dickheads after?

36
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:15,904
Babe, I am a girl down

37
00:02:15,906 --> 00:02:17,506
- for the under-18s match.
- No.

38
00:02:17,508 --> 00:02:18,741
I don't wanna be a wrestler.

39
00:02:18,743 --> 00:02:20,541
You would love
the buzz, darling.

40
00:02:20,543 --> 00:02:22,676
It's like coke, crack,
heroin combined.

41
00:02:22,678 --> 00:02:25,147
Have you done coke,
crack, and heroin?

42
00:02:25,149 --> 00:02:26,314
Not combined.

43
00:02:26,316 --> 00:02:28,251
Darling, if I have
to give refunds,

44
00:02:28,253 --> 00:02:30,185
I am buggered
six ways to Sunday.

45
00:02:30,187 --> 00:02:31,920
I need you to do this
for your family.

46
00:02:31,922 --> 00:02:33,022
Do you understand that?

47
00:02:33,024 --> 00:02:35,358
No, Dad, I can't wrestle
some random girl.

48
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,530
- I'll screw it up.
- What if you're wrestling me?

49
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:43,903
Let's go!

50
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:52,777
I can't do this, Zak.

51
00:02:52,779 --> 00:02:54,116
It's like a dance,
just follow me.

52
00:02:54,616 --> 00:02:56,081
Okay.

53
00:03:04,593 --> 00:03:05,595
Come on!

54
00:03:07,429 --> 00:03:08,430
Yeah!

55
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,430
Come on, princess!

56
00:03:10,432 --> 00:03:11,434
Come on, darling.

57
00:03:12,535 --> 00:03:15,105
Come on, girl!
You can do it!

58
00:03:19,743 --> 00:03:20,874
- Come on!
- Come on!

59
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,559
Come on, you muppets!

60
00:03:35,326 --> 00:03:36,826
Shut up! Sit down!

61
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:47,238
Hey.

62
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:50,675
Quick, her hair!

63
00:03:50,677 --> 00:03:51,877
Shut up!

64
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,878
Hey, don't you come in!
Don't you come in!

65
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,400
- I'm coming in!
- I'll disqualify you!

66
00:03:57,117 --> 00:03:59,417
Get off her throat!
Get off her throat now!

67
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:01,087
Come on!

68
00:04:05,893 --> 00:04:09,428
All right, I'm gettin' in!

69
00:04:16,371 --> 00:04:19,173
- Britani! Britani!

70
00:04:25,315 --> 00:04:26,981
Britani! Britani!

71
00:04:26,983 --> 00:04:29,554
Britani! Britani!

72
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,857
- Don't you dare!
- Oh, I will!

73
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,561
Zak attack! Zak attack!

74
00:04:38,563 --> 00:04:41,131
Zak attack! Zak attack!

75
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:42,232
Zak attack!

76
00:04:42,234 --> 00:04:43,700
No! No!

77
00:04:43,702 --> 00:04:45,969
Anything but this!

78
00:04:50,242 --> 00:04:51,475
One!

79
00:04:51,477 --> 00:04:52,743
Two!

80
00:04:52,745 --> 00:04:54,579
Three! That's it!

81
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:56,249
Come on!

82
00:04:58,185 --> 00:05:01,520
The winners,
Zak Zodiac and Britani!

83
00:05:28,284 --> 00:05:30,052
That's disgusting, Zak!

84
00:05:30,054 --> 00:05:31,919
- It's Dad's, it's not mine!
- Oh, for God's sake!

85
00:05:31,921 --> 00:05:33,441
I'm gonna pound on you,
I swear to God!

86
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:36,627
Two...

87
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,094

<i>Where?</i>

94
00:05:50,241 --> 00:05:51,808
Norwich.

95
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,645
It's the mustard capital
of England.

96
00:05:54,647 --> 00:05:56,547
You've heard of England,
innit ya?

97
00:05:56,549 --> 00:05:58,615
You hit Greenland
and take a right.

98
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,819
<i>What's this regarding, sir?</i>

99
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:03,954
I sent Mr. Morgan

00:06:08,562 --> 00:06:09,996
That's 'cause in the ring,
I'm Saraya.

104
00:06:09,998 --> 00:06:12,067
You might've heard of me,
Sweet Saraya Knight?

105
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,835
You still there, love?

106
00:06:16,837 --> 00:06:19,605
<i>I am. Mr. Morgan
will contact you if necessary.</i>

107
00:06:19,607 --> 00:06:20,941
<i>Thanks for calling WWE.</i>

108
00:06:20,943 --> 00:06:22,303
Do you know
if he watched the tape?

109
00:06:23,145 --> 00:06:24,646
- She hung up!
- I don't know.

110
00:06:24,648 --> 00:06:26,116
What a dick!

111
00:06:32,923 --> 00:06:34,123
- Wrestling!
- Wrestling?

112
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,357
You wanna come to wrestling?

113
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:37,025
Wrestling tonight!

114
00:06:37,027 --> 00:06:38,292
Hey! I'm wrestling tonight.

115
00:06:38,294 --> 00:06:39,761
Do you wanna come
to wrestling tonight?

116
00:06:39,763 --> 00:06:41,263
No.

117
00:06:41,265 --> 00:06:43,333
Wrestling? No? Okay.

118
00:06:43,335 --> 00:06:44,867
Excuse me. Do you wanna see
the wrestling? Live wrestling?

119
00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:47,271
I'm fighting tonight.
Do you wanna come watch?

120
00:06:48,206 --> 00:06:49,437
Live wrestling?

121
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:51,774
Excuse me!
Live wrestling?

122
00:06:59,517 --> 00:07:00,616
Come on!

123
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:16,538
Shit!

124
00:07:31,187 --> 00:07:32,353
I ain't got nothing!

125
00:07:32,355 --> 00:07:33,721
Why'd you run, then?

126
00:07:33,723 --> 00:07:35,123
You said I needed
to do more cardio.

127
00:07:37,494 --> 00:07:39,060
That's not mine.

128
00:07:39,062 --> 00:07:40,929
What's the plan, Ez, huh?

129
00:07:40,931 --> 00:07:43,367
You wanna deal?
Or do you wanna wrestle?

130
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:45,734
I wanna wrestle.

131
00:07:45,736 --> 00:07:47,335
Then cut this
crap out, mate,

132
00:07:47,337 --> 00:07:48,939
or I'm done with you.
Okay?

133
00:07:52,076 --> 00:07:53,509
Oh, don't throw that!

134
00:07:53,511 --> 00:07:56,081
That's the same shit
Rihanna smokes.

135
00:08:01,853 --> 00:08:03,887
Wrestling? Live wrestling?

136
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:05,289
Live wrestling!

137
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,457
Excuse me.

138
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:08,358
Have you ever been
to see live wrestling?

139
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,860
No.

140
00:08:09,862 --> 00:08:11,929
Well, can I ask why not?

141
00:08:11,931 --> 00:08:14,698
Because I'm not a child.
Or a moron.

142
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,735
You should come.

143
00:08:17,737 --> 00:08:20,206
Yeah, you should see her.
She's really good.

144
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,140
But she's a girl.

145
00:08:22,142 --> 00:08:23,544
Oh, God, is she not?

146
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,277
No, I am.

147
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:27,279
Is this, like, your costume?

148
00:08:27,281 --> 00:08:28,982
No, this is me.

149
00:08:28,984 --> 00:08:30,753
Wow.

150
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,753
Oh, wait, I know you.

151
00:08:33,755 --> 00:08:35,722
You're from that weird family,
aren't you?

152
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:36,957
We're not weird.

153
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,959
Yeah, her brother
was on the news.

154
00:08:38,961 --> 00:08:41,562
Didn't he do something mental?

155
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:43,665
Isn't he in jail?

156
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:45,399
You should come tonight.
It'll be really fun.

157
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:46,834
We don't like wrestling.

158
00:08:46,836 --> 00:08:48,738
How do you know
if you've never been?

159
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,306
I've never had
rectal bleeding before,

160
00:08:50,308 --> 00:08:51,940
but I'm pretty sure
I'm not a fan of that.

161
00:08:51,942 --> 00:08:53,943
How about I shove her head

162
00:08:53,945 --> 00:08:55,514
up your arse, and then
we can find out?

163
00:09:02,455 --> 00:09:03,652
Freak!

164
00:09:03,654 --> 00:09:05,624
Doors open at 7:00!

165
00:09:16,504 --> 00:09:17,903
Hey, Zak.

166
00:09:17,905 --> 00:09:22,340
<i>Bring your
daughter to the slaughter</i>

167
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:25,510
<i>Let her go
Let her go</i>

168
00:09:25,512 --> 00:09:29,481
<i>Let her go</i>

169
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:38,261
Let's go, Cal! Come on!

170
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,830
All right, just
follow the music.

171
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:45,934
Here, come here.

172
00:09:49,206 --> 00:09:51,739
Thing of beauty.
Right, Sunny, let's go.

173
00:09:51,741 --> 00:09:53,375
Lock up.

174
00:09:53,377 --> 00:09:56,012
Full nelson. Break.

175
00:09:56,014 --> 00:09:58,080
Snapmare. Lovely stuff.

176
00:09:58,082 --> 00:10:00,916
Okay. Mitchie.

177
00:10:00,918 --> 00:10:02,918
Lock up. Full nelson.

178
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,388
Break. Snapmare.

179
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,757
Nice, mate, nice!

180
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,425
Right, Ez, come on,
let's do this.

181
00:10:08,427 --> 00:10:10,061
Lock up.

182
00:10:10,063 --> 00:10:11,528
Full Nelson.

183
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,995
Break.

184
00:10:12,997 --> 00:10:15,100
Ez, have you got a stiffy?

185
00:10:15,102 --> 00:10:16,900
It's not my fault!

186
00:10:16,902 --> 00:10:18,303
It does what it wants!

187
00:10:18,305 --> 00:10:19,537
Yeah, well, tell it not to.

188
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:20,838
- Just pretend it's not there.
- No!

189
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,240
All right, Ez,
50 press-ups now, mate.

190
00:10:23,242 --> 00:10:24,611
What, for having a stiffy?

191
00:10:24,613 --> 00:10:25,977
No, for getting turned on
by my sister.

192
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:28,280
- How desperate are you, mate?
- Oh, shut up!

193
00:10:28,282 --> 00:10:30,149
Come on, let's go, let's go!

194
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:31,583
One, two...

195
00:10:31,585 --> 00:10:33,619
- Till it's gone!
- Three, four, five, six...

196
00:10:33,621 --> 00:10:36,055
- Another stiffy?
- Yeah!

197
00:10:36,057 --> 00:10:39,059
Seven, eight, nine, ten!

198
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:40,526
Hello, love.
All right.

199
00:10:40,528 --> 00:10:41,728
All right, J.

200
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,732
Understood.
Let me ask him, mate. Hang on.

201
00:10:44,734 --> 00:10:49,137
Listen, Glen wants to know
if you'll take one of these...

202
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:50,407
in the face.

203
00:10:51,908 --> 00:10:53,408
I don't know. What's it like?

204
00:10:58,482 --> 00:10:59,815
Fine.

205
00:10:59,817 --> 00:11:02,317
Yeah? Stings, innit?

206
00:11:02,319 --> 00:11:04,453
All right.

207
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,289
Glen? Hello, mate.
Yeah, he'll do it.

208
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,293
What?

209
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,395
Seriously?

210
00:11:12,397 --> 00:11:14,966
Hang on, Glen.

211
00:11:14,968 --> 00:11:17,668
Glen wants to know if, uh...

212
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,939
If you'll do one of these...

213
00:11:22,241 --> 00:11:23,809
In the willy.

214
00:11:23,811 --> 00:11:25,076
Ricky, you kidding me, mate?

215
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:26,511
- Breathe in.
- All right.

216
00:11:26,513 --> 00:11:27,679
When you release it,

217
00:11:27,681 --> 00:11:28,781
- I'll pop it in.
- All right.

218
00:11:28,783 --> 00:11:29,948
- Ready?
- All right.

219
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,249
On three.

220
00:11:31,251 --> 00:11:32,418
One.

221
00:11:36,457 --> 00:11:37,989
It's a unique sensation.

222
00:11:37,991 --> 00:11:39,258
You all right?

223
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,363
- Don't touch me.
- All right.

224
00:11:42,597 --> 00:11:43,966
Hang on, Glen.

225
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,736
- Go on. Yeah.
- Yeah?

226
00:11:47,336 --> 00:11:48,469
Glen? Yeah,

227
00:11:48,471 --> 00:11:50,307
he'll take a bowling ball
in the bollocks.

228
00:11:50,973 --> 00:11:53,674
Ah! Sixty quid?

229
00:11:53,676 --> 00:11:56,177
Glen, mate, you're killing me.

230
00:11:56,179 --> 00:11:58,645
It's not gonna be worth him
making the trip for that.

231
00:11:58,647 --> 00:12:02,517
I don't wanna see that, right?
I don't wanna see that.

232
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,752
Just a nice clean headlock,

233
00:12:03,754 --> 00:12:05,487
straight into position.
Understood?

234
00:12:05,489 --> 00:12:07,591
- Yes, Coach!
- Great, okay!

235
00:12:09,894 --> 00:12:11,627
All right, Cal.
You getting in then, mate?

236
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:13,796
Oh, no, thanks! I just
come here for the smells.

237
00:12:13,798 --> 00:12:15,198
You're a teenager
and you're blind.

238
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,700
What else are you gonna
do today? Listen to porn?

239
00:12:17,702 --> 00:12:19,571
Calum!

240
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:23,040
Calum! Calum! Calum!

241
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,877
- There we go!
- Yes, Calum!

242
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,580
All right, seriously,
how's he gonna wrestle?

243
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:29,951
No idea.

244
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:32,853
What did we do
last night, babe?

245
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:35,387
Four hundred.

246
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:37,022
Bloody hell.

247
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:38,223
If things don't pick up soon,

248
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:40,425
I'm gonna have to go
back to thieving.

249
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,028
I don't care how
desperate things get,

250
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,395
you're not going
back to thieving.

251
00:12:43,397 --> 00:12:44,565
You're not.

252
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,432
Zak can do it.

253
00:12:46,434 --> 00:12:48,037
Raya can go on the game.

254
00:12:49,404 --> 00:12:51,738
We're gonna be all right.

255
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,674
- One, two...
- Yeah.

256
00:12:53,676 --> 00:12:55,742
...three and turn.

257
00:12:55,744 --> 00:13:00,349
One, two, three and turn.

258
00:13:00,351 --> 00:13:02,618
Oh, can me and Courtney
have a word?

259
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,752
- Yeah. Sure.
- Great.

260
00:13:12,896 --> 00:13:15,098
I'm not asking us to bow
and scrape or nothing.

261
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,566
I'm just saying...

262
00:13:16,568 --> 00:13:18,201
Courtney's parents
are a bit...

263
00:13:18,203 --> 00:13:20,971
- You know, what's the word?
- Posh?

264
00:13:20,973 --> 00:13:22,438
Classy!

265
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,773
Her dad's teetotal.

266
00:13:23,775 --> 00:13:25,075
So am I.

267
00:13:25,077 --> 00:13:26,778
Yeah, but he's teetotal
out of choice, Dad.

268
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,246
Not 'cause he's an alcoholic.

269
00:13:28,248 --> 00:13:29,613
La-di-da.

270
00:13:29,615 --> 00:13:30,948
You want us to make
a good impression.

271
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,350
- Yes.
- Yeah?

272
00:13:32,352 --> 00:13:34,151
- A good impression how?
- Well, can he put a shirt on?

273
00:13:34,153 --> 00:13:36,420
A shirt on?
How bloody posh are they?

274
00:13:36,422 --> 00:13:37,622
That's another thing.

275
00:13:37,624 --> 00:13:39,659
Courtney's dad,
he don't swear apparently.

276
00:13:39,661 --> 00:13:41,593
So, let's just keep
the effing and jeffing

277
00:13:41,595 --> 00:13:42,960
down to a minimum, please.

278
00:13:42,962 --> 00:13:44,630
Oh, unbelievable!
Who is her dad?

279
00:13:44,632 --> 00:13:47,403
The Archbishop of shitting...

280
00:13:48,102 --> 00:13:49,435
Kent?

281
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:50,771
What did I just say?

282
00:13:50,773 --> 00:13:52,272
Raya, help me out.

283
00:13:52,274 --> 00:13:55,176
Look, he wants to make
a good impression...

284
00:13:55,178 --> 00:13:57,577
because Courtney's great,
and he loves her...

285
00:13:57,579 --> 00:13:58,845
and he respects her...

286
00:13:58,847 --> 00:14:00,147
And he got her up the duff.

287
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:01,581
I didn't get her up the duff.

288
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,417
It's known as
an unplanned pregnancy.

289
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:05,520
All pregnancies
are unplanned, son.

290
00:14:05,522 --> 00:14:06,987
Whatever happens tonight...

291
00:14:06,989 --> 00:14:09,024
it will never be as bad
as when you went on in

292
00:14:09,026 --> 00:14:10,326
King's Lynn
wearing his shorts.

293
00:14:10,328 --> 00:14:12,827
Oh, yeah, your little
willy fell out.

294
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:14,664
Little?
Why would you say little?

295
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,265
Big enough to get
Courtney up the duff.

296
00:14:16,267 --> 00:14:18,001
Ugh. That is gross.

297
00:14:18,003 --> 00:14:19,501
Look, for Courtney's sake...

298
00:14:19,503 --> 00:14:22,038
let's all just try
and act a little bit normal.

299
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,339
- All right.
- Okay.

300
00:14:23,341 --> 00:14:24,708
Dad?

301
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,977
Yes, I will behave.

302
00:14:26,979 --> 00:14:28,413
Thank you.

303
00:14:32,217 --> 00:14:35,286
May I just say my husband
and I are delighted

304
00:14:35,288 --> 00:14:36,954
to finally make
your acquaintance.

305
00:14:36,956 --> 00:14:39,891
Absolutely, and likewise.

306
00:14:39,893 --> 00:14:43,229
Courtney tells us that
you're all, uh, wrestlers.

307
00:14:43,231 --> 00:14:45,129
- Yeah, whole family.
- Yup. Yes, we are.

308
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:46,297
Whole family of wrestlers.

309
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:47,832
And our half-brother, Roy.

310
00:14:47,834 --> 00:14:50,802
So, what sort of people
enjoy wrestling?

311
00:14:50,804 --> 00:14:52,539
That's a good question.

312
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,343
I mean, it's all fake
anyway, isn't it?

313
00:14:55,744 --> 00:14:56,909
Come again?

314
00:14:56,911 --> 00:14:59,212
It's not fake, it's fixed.

315
00:14:59,214 --> 00:15:00,747
Yeah, if it was fake,
would I have broken

316
00:15:00,749 --> 00:15:02,216
half the parts
of my body deaf?

317
00:15:02,218 --> 00:15:03,717
His left leg bends both ways.

318
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:05,519
Well, that's nothing.
You should see his cock.

319
00:15:06,922 --> 00:15:08,024
Mum.

320
00:15:08,859 --> 00:15:09,924
Sorry.

321
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:11,729
Penis, you should
see his penis.

322
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,034
Have you got
another question or...

323
00:15:19,036 --> 00:15:20,169
I can, yes.

324
00:15:20,171 --> 00:15:22,506
How did you
get into wrestling?

325
00:15:22,508 --> 00:15:24,206
It's quite a romantic story.

326
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,841
We like
romantic stories, so...

327
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:28,176
Oh, right, well,
you'll like this one.

328
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:30,113
Well, when I met Rick, I was
thinking of killing meself.

329
00:15:30,115 --> 00:15:32,182
Pills.

330
00:15:32,184 --> 00:15:35,786
I was homeless, abused, living
on the street, you know.

331
00:15:35,788 --> 00:15:36,955
Yep.

332
00:15:36,957 --> 00:15:39,322
I myself had done
eight years in prison.

333
00:15:39,324 --> 00:15:40,427
Prison?

334
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:43,894
What was that for?

335
00:15:43,896 --> 00:15:45,797
- Mainly violence.
- Mainly violence, yeah.

336
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:48,467
Bit of armed robbery.
You know?

337
00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:50,035
Anyway, I came back
to the flat one night,

338
00:15:50,037 --> 00:15:51,371
and there was, uh, guns...

339
00:15:51,373 --> 00:15:52,704
money on the table,
everything.

340
00:15:52,706 --> 00:15:54,106
- Sorry, there was guns and...
- Money.

341
00:15:54,108 --> 00:15:55,274
- Guns and money, right.
- Yeah.

342
00:15:55,276 --> 00:15:56,442
Done a job, hadn't you?

343
00:15:56,444 --> 00:15:58,044
And I looked at him...

344
00:15:58,046 --> 00:15:59,579
The look said, essentially...

345
00:15:59,581 --> 00:16:01,281
"Ricky, turn your back
on crime.

346
00:16:01,283 --> 00:16:02,815
Otherwise, I'm gonna
turn my back on you."

347
00:16:02,817 --> 00:16:04,318
- And he did.
- That's what I did.

348
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,451
Never looked back.

349
00:16:05,453 --> 00:16:07,454
Some people find
religion, but wrestling...

350
00:16:07,456 --> 00:16:09,257
We found wrestling, didn't we?
It was our salvation.

351
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,658
We found each other and all.

352
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,792
Yeah.

353
00:16:13,197 --> 00:16:15,595
It's a tale as old
as time itself, babe.

354
00:16:15,597 --> 00:16:16,632
Hmm.

355
00:16:17,134 --> 00:16:18,301
Oh.

356
00:16:18,303 --> 00:16:19,467
Mum.

357
00:16:19,469 --> 00:16:21,470
Not this now, please.

358
00:16:22,872 --> 00:16:24,275
I'll get it.

359
00:16:25,175 --> 00:16:26,607
Hello?

360
00:16:26,609 --> 00:16:28,144
Can I put you
on speaker for a second?

361
00:16:28,146 --> 00:16:29,413
Yeah, hang on.

362
00:16:29,415 --> 00:16:30,780
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

363
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,948
- Go ahead.
- <i>Am I speaking to Zak</i>

364
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,351
- <i>and Britani?</i>
- Yeah.

365
00:16:34,353 --> 00:16:36,689
<i>My name is Hutch Morgan.
I'm calling from WWE.</i>

366
00:16:38,157 --> 00:16:40,123
<i>We were very impressed
by your tape.</i>

367
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,026
<i>In April, we're bringing</i>
SmackDown <i>to the O2 in London.</i>

368
00:16:43,028 --> 00:16:45,999
<i>And we'd like both of you to
come down and try out for us.</i>

369
00:16:48,202 --> 00:16:49,202
<i>Hello?</i>

370
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,603
They'd be
very happy to accept.

371
00:16:52,605 --> 00:16:54,540
<i>Good. And we
already have a Britani,</i>

372
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:56,474
<i>so just think
of an alternative name.</i>

373
00:16:56,476 --> 00:16:58,177
Yeah, sure, okay.

374
00:16:58,179 --> 00:17:00,046
Thank you so much!

375
00:17:00,048 --> 00:17:02,217
Yeah, yeah. Thank you.
Thank you very much, sir.

376
00:17:05,886 --> 00:17:07,287
Oh, my God!

377
00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:08,722
WWE!

378
00:17:08,724 --> 00:17:11,024
Oh, my God!

379
00:17:11,026 --> 00:17:12,192
Zak, they want us!

380
00:17:12,194 --> 00:17:14,296
I told you, I told you!
It was a given.

381
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:20,802
Sorry, what is the WWE?

382
00:17:22,406 --> 00:17:23,406
Say what?

383
00:17:25,408 --> 00:17:26,941
<i>He is</i>

384
00:17:26,943 --> 00:17:29,112
<i>the greatest professional
athlete in the world today!</i>

385
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:32,383
<i>Austin 3:16 says
I just whipped your ass!</i>

386
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,853
<i>Turn it sideways</i>

387
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,790
<i>and stick it straight up
your candy ass!</i>

388
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,859
<i>That is extraordinary
flexibility</i>

389
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:45,065
<i>from that young lady.</i>

390
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:47,597
<i>Austin, face first...</i>

391
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,099
<i>Never seen a reaction
to anybody</i>

392
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,867
<i>like this since the Beatles!</i>

393
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:55,708
<i>Because
the champ is here!</i>

394
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,909
For a wrestler,

395
00:17:56,911 --> 00:17:58,276
it don't get bigger
than the WWE.

396
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:01,547
And to be WWE champion...

397
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:03,883
- Oh...
- It's the pinnacle. Okay?

398
00:18:03,885 --> 00:18:06,552
It's something that
we have wished for

399
00:18:06,554 --> 00:18:08,120
since we first
stepped in the ring.

400
00:18:08,122 --> 00:18:09,889
And Zak's got it
all worked out.

401
00:18:09,891 --> 00:18:12,090
We'd get a big villa
in Florida.

402
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,761
With a nursery,
of course.

403
00:18:13,763 --> 00:18:16,230
Nice big playroom,
swimming pool.

404
00:18:16,232 --> 00:18:18,799
I'll live next door,
so I can babysit whenever.

405
00:18:18,801 --> 00:18:20,400
And when they come back
as Superstars,

406
00:18:20,402 --> 00:18:21,802
we'll have full houses
every night.

407
00:18:21,804 --> 00:18:23,871
We'll be shifting
a ton of merchandise.

408
00:18:23,873 --> 00:18:25,974
You should buy shares in this.

409
00:18:25,976 --> 00:18:27,475
No, seriously.

410
00:18:27,477 --> 00:18:30,445
I've got the paperwork here,
if you wanna have a gander.

411
00:18:30,447 --> 00:18:31,549
Dad, not now.

412
00:18:32,114 --> 00:18:33,649
All right.

413
00:18:33,651 --> 00:18:35,150
Do you think
you're likely to get in?

414
00:18:35,152 --> 00:18:36,887
Will he get in?

415
00:18:36,889 --> 00:18:38,254
I've been training this one

416
00:18:38,256 --> 00:18:40,421
since before he had fur
on his bollocks.

417
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:42,626
Sorry, love, ball bag.

418
00:18:42,628 --> 00:18:44,728
You should see
Raya in the ring.

419
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,164
She's like a beautiful
ballet dancer.

420
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,299
The biggest thrill I get
is when people say,

421
00:18:49,301 --> 00:18:51,168
"She reminds me of you."

422
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,904
These tryouts,
are they very taxing?

423
00:18:53,906 --> 00:18:55,040
Oh, yeah.

424
00:18:55,042 --> 00:18:57,307
It's like <i>The Hunger Games,</i>
you know.

425
00:18:57,309 --> 00:18:59,244
My other boy, Roy...

426
00:18:59,246 --> 00:19:01,179
he did it a few years ago,
actually.

427
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,914
So he's in America now?

428
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,919
No, no. He's, um...

429
00:19:05,618 --> 00:19:06,754
He's in prison.

430
00:19:08,422 --> 00:19:12,358
When Roy didn't get signed,
he didn't take it too well.

431
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,196
He started drinking,
picking fights.

432
00:19:16,264 --> 00:19:17,963
He threw a chunk of tarmac
at a bloke's head

433
00:19:17,965 --> 00:19:19,301
and put him in a coma.

434
00:19:23,138 --> 00:19:25,640
Look. Zak's not Roy.

435
00:19:25,642 --> 00:19:27,374
And he's gonna make
you and Courtney

436
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:30,279
the most proud people
in the world.

437
00:19:30,281 --> 00:19:32,450
I know this
'cause he's my brother.

438
00:19:33,184 --> 00:19:34,886
You can trust me.

439
00:19:47,232 --> 00:19:48,897
My name's Zak Zodiac.

440
00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:50,466
When I was three years old...

441
00:19:50,468 --> 00:19:52,802
I could name
every WWE wrestler

442
00:19:52,804 --> 00:19:55,205
just by looking at his boots.

443
00:19:55,207 --> 00:19:56,840
Zak Zodiac.

444
00:19:56,842 --> 00:19:59,144
Every wrestler
just by looking at his boots.

445
00:19:59,146 --> 00:20:02,350
When I was three years old,
I could name...

446
00:20:03,484 --> 00:20:05,218
You all right?

447
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:08,754
All right. What's wrong?

448
00:20:08,756 --> 00:20:10,391
I know when you're lying.

449
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,729
This is our shot, Zak.

450
00:20:16,264 --> 00:20:17,899
I know.

451
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:20,700
But what if I screw up?

452
00:20:20,702 --> 00:20:23,504
You won't.

453
00:20:23,506 --> 00:20:25,939
Come on. You're gonna
smash it tomorrow.

454
00:20:25,941 --> 00:20:27,040
How do you know?

455
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:28,910
Because you're a Knight.

456
00:20:28,912 --> 00:20:30,844
Wrestling's in your blood.

457
00:20:30,846 --> 00:20:33,116
That's not good. That makes
it sound like hepatitis.

458
00:20:34,383 --> 00:20:35,917
Yeah, it is.

459
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,019
We're riddled with wrestling.

460
00:20:38,021 --> 00:20:40,391
And there's no cure.

461
00:20:42,594 --> 00:20:43,595
Okay?

462
00:20:44,061 --> 00:20:45,062
Okay.

463
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,012
Tryouts that way?
We're here for the tryout.

464
00:21:02,014 --> 00:21:03,981
- We're here for the tryouts.
- Yeah. Yeah, that way.

465
00:21:03,983 --> 00:21:05,348
Great.

466
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,751
Sorry. We're here for
the tryouts. Tryouts that way?

467
00:21:06,753 --> 00:21:08,889
- They're downstairs.
- Great. Thank you.

468
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,270
Whoa!

469
00:21:28,977 --> 00:21:31,978
So cool.
Can you imagine it?

470
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:36,318
20,000 people
just shouting your name.

471
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,158
Zodiac! Zodiac! Zodiac!
Just insane.

472
00:21:52,303 --> 00:21:53,535
Whoa!

473
00:21:53,537 --> 00:21:54,871
- Sorry about that.
- Sorry, mate.

474
00:21:54,873 --> 00:21:56,174
Dick me dead,
bury me pregnant.

475
00:22:00,947 --> 00:22:03,045
That's
a good pick-up line.

476
00:22:03,047 --> 00:22:05,115
- Zak Zodiac, mate.
- What's up, Zak?

477
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:06,284
What an honor
to meet you, mate.

478
00:22:06,286 --> 00:22:07,352
- Oh, thanks, Zak.
- Yeah,

479
00:22:07,354 --> 00:22:08,553
- yeah, Zak, Zak. Yeah.
- Cool.

480
00:22:08,555 --> 00:22:10,555
- This is my sister, Saraya.
- We're huge fans.

481
00:22:10,557 --> 00:22:12,724
- Thank you so much.
- Since we were kids.

482
00:22:12,726 --> 00:22:14,125
Yeah, we've been fans
since you had hair.

483
00:22:14,127 --> 00:22:15,527
Oh, thank you.

484
00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:17,028
Hey, it's a choice.
A damn good one, too.

485
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,398
- Yeah, no, it looks good.
- It looks great, fantastic.

486
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,531
See you guys.

487
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:21,834
Rock, Rock, Rock!

488
00:22:21,836 --> 00:22:23,068
Yo.

489
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,505
What's happening? Are you
getting back in the ring?

490
00:22:24,507 --> 00:22:26,306
- You wrestling again?
- Uh, no. No, no, no.

491
00:22:26,308 --> 00:22:27,740
I'm just shooting a movie
here in London...

492
00:22:27,742 --> 00:22:29,375
and I'm gonna
surprise the crowd tonight.

493
00:22:29,377 --> 00:22:31,411
Gonna electrify.
Don't tell anybody.

494
00:22:31,413 --> 00:22:32,680
- No, no.
- No.

495
00:22:32,682 --> 00:22:33,814
All right, see you guys.

496
00:22:33,816 --> 00:22:36,083
- Rock, Rock, Rock!
- Hey.

497
00:22:36,085 --> 00:22:37,350
We're wrestlers
as well, actually.

498
00:22:37,352 --> 00:22:38,720
We're actually doing
the tryouts today.

499
00:22:38,722 --> 00:22:39,886
Oh, cool.

500
00:22:39,888 --> 00:22:41,154
Our whole family wrestle.

501
00:22:41,156 --> 00:22:42,825
WAW, up in Norwich.

502
00:22:42,827 --> 00:22:43,947
You've probably heard of it.

503
00:22:44,427 --> 00:22:45,527
Uh, no.

504
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:46,694
No?

505
00:22:46,696 --> 00:22:48,997
Actually,
whilst you're here...

506
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:50,231
He should come
to one of our shows!

507
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:51,332
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!

508
00:22:51,334 --> 00:22:52,667
We could
get you tickets...

509
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:54,104
Half-price, probably.

510
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:55,437
Half-price?

511
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:56,839
I'll text Mango Pete,
get him on the list.

512
00:22:56,841 --> 00:22:58,875
- Yeah, yeah.
- Do you need a plus-one?

513
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,011
Uh, that's awesome.
Thank you for the invite.

514
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:02,745
I don't think I'll be
able to make it, though.

515
00:23:02,747 --> 00:23:04,281
Good luck
with your tryout. Okay.

516
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:06,183
- Thanks.
- Thanks, mate.

517
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:07,553
Rock, Rock, Rock!

518
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,119
Yes, Zak.

519
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:12,689
What advice would you give us?
If we wanna...

520
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:13,891
Win over the crowd.

521
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,128
Win over the crowd.
If we wanna...

522
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,265
If we wanna be the next you.

523
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,937
- What are your names again?
- My name is...

524
00:23:24,939 --> 00:23:27,072
It doesn't matter
what your names are!

525
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:28,806
You walk around here
interrupting The Rock.

526
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:31,077
You, like you haven't seen
the sun in 20 years!

527
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,978
You, like you just
stepped out of <i>Oliver Twist!</i>

528
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,747
Please, sir, may I have
some more advice, sir?

529
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:36,883
You want some advice?

530
00:23:36,885 --> 00:23:38,384
Here's The Rock's advice!
Shut your mouth!

531
00:23:38,386 --> 00:23:41,122
What you want! What you want!
How about what The Rock wants?

532
00:23:41,124 --> 00:23:43,423
The Rock wants you to go
out there, take no prisoners,

533
00:23:43,425 --> 00:23:45,059
have no regrets, have no fear!

534
00:23:45,061 --> 00:23:46,894
Lay it all out on the line!

535
00:23:46,896 --> 00:23:48,129
Because if you
don't do that...

536
00:23:48,131 --> 00:23:49,731
The Rock is gonna find
your friend Mary Poppins.

537
00:23:49,733 --> 00:23:50,899
He's gonna take her umbrella.

538
00:23:50,901 --> 00:23:52,500
Yeah, he's gonna
shine it up real nice.

539
00:23:52,502 --> 00:23:54,135
He's gonna turn
that sumbitch sideways

540
00:23:54,137 --> 00:23:56,238
and stick it straight up
your candy asses!

541
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,472
There's your advice!

542
00:23:57,474 --> 00:23:59,609
Straight out
of the Jabroni-beating,

543
00:23:59,611 --> 00:24:01,310
pie-eating, trailblazing,
eyebrow-raising...

544
00:24:01,312 --> 00:24:03,145
entertaining the globe,
never hotter...

545
00:24:03,147 --> 00:24:05,850
talking to two rejects
from <i>Harry Potter!</i>

546
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:11,689
So that's how you
win over the crowd.

547
00:24:11,691 --> 00:24:13,790
Yeah.

548
00:24:13,792 --> 00:24:15,626
Even though this
crazy wrestling world

549
00:24:15,628 --> 00:24:17,462
is a fictionalized world...

550
00:24:17,464 --> 00:24:20,464
The fans know 1,000%
if you're not being real.

551
00:24:20,466 --> 00:24:22,500
All right? That guy just now,
that was The Rock.

552
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,502
The Rock is me.
Dwayne Johnson...

553
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:25,971
Just with the volume
turned way up,

554
00:24:25,973 --> 00:24:27,540
the treble adjusted, the bass.

555
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:28,774
Same guy.

556
00:24:28,776 --> 00:24:31,045
So don't worry about
being the next me.

557
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,980
Be the first you.

558
00:24:35,382 --> 00:24:37,850
Hey! Are you two here
for the tryouts?

559
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:39,052
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

560
00:24:39,054 --> 00:24:40,788
You can't just hang out
with The Rock.

561
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,122
What are you,
Make-A-Wish kids?

562
00:24:42,124 --> 00:24:43,125
Let's go!

563
00:24:43,758 --> 00:24:44,826
Better go.

564
00:24:45,961 --> 00:24:47,227
- Thanks, mate!
- Yeah!

565
00:24:47,229 --> 00:24:48,429
- Thanks, Dwayne!
- You got it!

566
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,566
That was The Rock!

567
00:24:52,568 --> 00:24:54,768
Insane, insane.
Come on, let's go.

568
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:57,540
To be a WWE Superstar,
you have to have two things.

569
00:24:57,542 --> 00:24:59,842
Number one,
you gotta have the skills

570
00:24:59,844 --> 00:25:01,409
and number two,
you have to have the spark.

571
00:25:01,411 --> 00:25:03,012
Now, skills,
that's obvious, right?

572
00:25:03,014 --> 00:25:04,246
You gotta be able to wrestle.

573
00:25:04,248 --> 00:25:07,182
The spark, well...

574
00:25:07,184 --> 00:25:08,885
That's the magic dust.

575
00:25:08,887 --> 00:25:11,321
It's what the audience
falls in love with.

576
00:25:11,323 --> 00:25:13,189
It's why they buy your poster.

577
00:25:13,191 --> 00:25:14,690
It's why they
come back every week.

578
00:25:14,692 --> 00:25:16,094
It's why they chant your name.

579
00:25:16,096 --> 00:25:17,527
It's why they buy

580
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:20,765
a six-inch
action figure of you.

581
00:25:20,767 --> 00:25:24,869
Do you see yourself
as a six-inch action figure?

582
00:25:24,871 --> 00:25:27,739
Yeah. Yes, I do.
I see myself as WWE Champion.

583
00:25:27,741 --> 00:25:29,874
Ding, ding, ding!
Bingo, guys!

584
00:25:29,876 --> 00:25:32,176
That's exactly right. That's
called a great attitude.

585
00:25:32,178 --> 00:25:33,578
And that's a big plate of yes.

586
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,280
That is one of the biggest
requirements

587
00:25:35,282 --> 00:25:37,916
that you have to have
to be a WWE Superstar.

588
00:25:37,918 --> 00:25:39,885
And you don't have
any of the other things.

589
00:25:39,887 --> 00:25:41,921
But the attitude's the one
thing you're in control over

590
00:25:41,923 --> 00:25:43,890
and the attitude's the one
thing that you have.

591
00:25:43,892 --> 00:25:44,894
Name.

592
00:25:45,762 --> 00:25:47,126
Zak Zodiac.

593
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:50,896
Sounds a little bit like
a dancer at a male strip club.

594
00:25:50,898 --> 00:25:53,067
Why do you wanna wrestle?

595
00:25:53,069 --> 00:25:56,471
I wanna be a wrestler because
since I was three years old...

596
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:58,205
I could name
every single WWE wrestler

597
00:25:58,207 --> 00:26:00,308
just by looking
at their boots.

598
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,975
And I've wanted to be
one ever since.

599
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,246
I'm passionate,
I'm determined...

600
00:26:04,248 --> 00:26:07,949
And I'm the toughest
bastard in any room...

601
00:26:07,951 --> 00:26:09,385
Including this one.

602
00:26:09,387 --> 00:26:10,753
Oh, probably shouldn't swear,

603
00:26:10,755 --> 00:26:12,722
not when there's
ladies present.

604
00:26:12,724 --> 00:26:14,827
Sorry, miss. Sorry about that.

605
00:26:18,631 --> 00:26:19,795
Miss, what's your name?

606
00:26:19,797 --> 00:26:22,433
Saraya.
No, sorry, Britani.

607
00:26:22,435 --> 00:26:23,735
Do you not remember your name?

608
00:26:23,737 --> 00:26:25,503
No, I do. It's just
they asked me to change it.

609
00:26:25,505 --> 00:26:26,771
Do you remember
what you changed it to?

610
00:26:26,773 --> 00:26:28,139
- Yeah.
- Okay, that's good.

611
00:26:28,141 --> 00:26:29,306
What is it?

612
00:26:29,308 --> 00:26:30,409
Uh, Paige.

613
00:26:30,411 --> 00:26:31,909
As a wrestling name, Paige?

614
00:26:31,911 --> 00:26:33,112
Yeah.

615
00:26:33,114 --> 00:26:35,113
Paige feels a little more
like she might work

616
00:26:35,115 --> 00:26:37,181
at the perfume counter
at the mall...

617
00:26:37,183 --> 00:26:39,118
Like, "Do you want
a free sample?"

618
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,620
No, Paige is the name
of a witch

619
00:26:40,622 --> 00:26:42,188
from a TV show that I like.

620
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,390
So you liked the name off
the show and then you took it?

621
00:26:44,794 --> 00:26:45,795
Yeah.

622
00:26:47,163 --> 00:26:49,796
Nobody's gonna pay to watch

623
00:26:49,798 --> 00:26:51,835
a timid little
British girl wrestle.

624
00:26:53,635 --> 00:26:56,537
Yeah, well, not all
British girls are timid.

625
00:26:56,539 --> 00:26:59,009
Just like not all Americans
are arrogant wankers.

626
00:27:00,777 --> 00:27:02,180
Just saying.

627
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,980
Why do you wanna
wrestle, Paige?

628
00:27:04,982 --> 00:27:08,282
Been wrestling since I was 13.
My whole family wrestles.

629
00:27:08,284 --> 00:27:10,050
But why do you wanna wrestle?

630
00:27:10,052 --> 00:27:12,821
Been wrestling since I was 13.
My whole family wrestles.

631
00:27:12,823 --> 00:27:14,659
But why do you wanna wrestle?

632
00:27:17,229 --> 00:27:18,297
Um...

633
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:23,166
It's an escape, isn't it?

634
00:27:23,168 --> 00:27:25,469
From the real world.

635
00:27:25,471 --> 00:27:27,003
And when I'm in that ring
with my family,

636
00:27:27,005 --> 00:27:30,641
working together,
flowing together...

637
00:27:30,643 --> 00:27:33,913
It feels like the world
just disappears.

638
00:27:36,082 --> 00:27:38,718
And I sort of feel like
I belong somewhere.

639
00:27:40,487 --> 00:27:42,556
She showed us her heart.

640
00:27:43,725 --> 00:27:45,323
And I wanna vomit.

641
00:27:45,325 --> 00:27:47,225
You, who got you dressed?

642
00:27:47,227 --> 00:27:48,427
The whole thing
was your thing?

643
00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:49,696
- That's your salad?
- Yeah. Yeah.

644
00:27:49,698 --> 00:27:51,064
That's what you mixed up
in a bowl?

645
00:27:51,066 --> 00:27:53,166
- Yeah, I like it.
- Okay.

646
00:27:53,168 --> 00:27:54,767
Do you know what a push-up is?

647
00:28:01,177 --> 00:28:02,746
Come on, guys.
Pace, pace, pace!

648
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,085
Who knew? A leopard
in sheikh's clothing.

649
00:28:16,893 --> 00:28:18,463
Cupid's Arrow!

650
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,146
You need to play everything
out more, all right?

651
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:38,817
Sell your snaps harder, okay?
Shot, kick, bulldog.

652
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:40,719
- Ready?
- Yeah, good one.

653
00:29:00,943 --> 00:29:03,143
Nice finisher.
Is that your move?

654
00:29:03,145 --> 00:29:04,848
Yeah, Zak Attack.

655
00:29:07,584 --> 00:29:09,083
You dick.

656
00:29:09,085 --> 00:29:11,418
Give yourselves
a big hand, everybody.

657
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,788
That was a tremendous amount
of energy and effort...

658
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,291
and I want to thank
all of you for that.

659
00:29:15,293 --> 00:29:17,927
It takes a lot of courage
to put yourself out there

660
00:29:17,929 --> 00:29:19,328
and I respect that.

661
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:21,796
If I call your name,
please step forward.

662
00:29:21,798 --> 00:29:23,832
That means you will be coming
with me to Florida,

663
00:29:23,834 --> 00:29:26,303
where you will join
NXT Developmental.

664
00:29:26,305 --> 00:29:28,405
At which point, we will assess

665
00:29:28,407 --> 00:29:30,774
whether or not
you get to go on to the WWE.

666
00:29:30,776 --> 00:29:32,341
If I do not call your name,

667
00:29:32,343 --> 00:29:33,979
then this is the end
of the line for you.

668
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:37,651
Paige.

669
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:46,060
Thank you all very much.

670
00:29:56,871 --> 00:29:57,871
Well done.

671
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:01,373
This isn't right.

672
00:30:08,251 --> 00:30:09,519
Raya.

673
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,425
You have
to take my brother.

674
00:30:18,427 --> 00:30:19,927
Excuse me?

675
00:30:19,929 --> 00:30:22,029
No one deserves this more than
Zak. Why didn't you pick him?

676
00:30:22,031 --> 00:30:24,133
99% of the people
don't get picked.

677
00:30:24,135 --> 00:30:26,368
He was running rings
around those other guys!

678
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:27,936
We're not looking
for ring runners.

679
00:30:27,938 --> 00:30:31,241
No, wait. You have to explain
why you didn't pick him!

680
00:30:31,243 --> 00:30:33,443
I don't have
to explain anything.

681
00:30:33,445 --> 00:30:34,711
I wish you the best, son.

682
00:30:34,713 --> 00:30:36,516
But this is the end
of the line for you.

683
00:30:39,185 --> 00:30:40,416
If he's not going,
neither am I.

684
00:30:40,418 --> 00:30:42,186
- Raya, don't be stupid, okay?
- Is that a threat?

685
00:30:42,188 --> 00:30:43,754
- Yes.
- No.

686
00:30:43,756 --> 00:30:45,089
You know, thousands of people

687
00:30:45,091 --> 00:30:47,291
apply for this opportunity
every week.

688
00:30:47,293 --> 00:30:48,458
Now, I'm gonna give you
ten seconds

689
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,727
to let me know
that you want it.

690
00:30:49,729 --> 00:30:50,928
Not without Zak.

691
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,610
Coach, she wants this.
Don't listen to her.

692
00:30:54,267 --> 00:30:55,769
Raya, let's just leave it.
Come on!

693
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,469
Five.

694
00:30:57,471 --> 00:30:59,037
Raya.

695
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,371
Four.

696
00:31:00,373 --> 00:31:01,874
You're not just doing this
for you, Raya, are you?

697
00:31:01,876 --> 00:31:04,078
You're doing it
for the family.

698
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,481
Three.

699
00:31:06,547 --> 00:31:09,050
- Two.
- Yeah, okay, I want this.

700
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,122
See you in Florida.

701
00:31:49,096 --> 00:31:50,662
Well?

702
00:31:50,664 --> 00:31:51,831
They didn't take me.

703
00:31:54,868 --> 00:31:55,935
But...

704
00:31:56,971 --> 00:31:58,437
my little sister just became

705
00:31:58,439 --> 00:32:00,505
the first 18-year-old
English girl,

706
00:32:00,507 --> 00:32:03,041
to be signed by the WWE!

707
00:32:08,283 --> 00:32:09,617
Champagne!

708
00:32:09,619 --> 00:32:11,150
Ez, oi, go down
to the corner shop,

709
00:32:11,152 --> 00:32:12,485
nick a bottle
of champagne. Go on.

710
00:32:12,487 --> 00:32:15,554
This is so exciting!

711
00:32:15,556 --> 00:32:17,891
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah, of course. Fine.

712
00:32:17,893 --> 00:32:18,993
Well done, Raya.

713
00:32:18,995 --> 00:32:19,996
Attaboy.

714
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,030
Suits you, that.

715
00:33:24,367 --> 00:33:25,933
Remember when we made these?

716
00:33:25,935 --> 00:33:27,538
Yeah, of course.

717
00:33:29,739 --> 00:33:30,937
Take your bag down, yeah?

718
00:33:30,939 --> 00:33:33,276
Yeah, please. Thanks.

719
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:55,833
Come on. Chop-chop.
In the van.

720
00:33:55,835 --> 00:33:58,468
I'm not gonna be able
to make it to the airport.

721
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,170
What're you talking about?

722
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:02,673
Just got some things
I need to do.

723
00:34:02,675 --> 00:34:04,944
Your sister's
going to America.

724
00:34:04,946 --> 00:34:07,612
Yeah, I know.
Just can't get out of it.

725
00:34:07,614 --> 00:34:10,815
It's fine. If he's busy.

726
00:34:10,817 --> 00:34:11,818
All right.

727
00:34:17,425 --> 00:34:18,958
Sorry, I just
got things to do.

728
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,592
I get it. It's cool.

729
00:34:22,029 --> 00:34:23,200
All right, well then...

730
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:34,308
Good luck with it all.

731
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,709
Good luck with the baby.

732
00:34:35,711 --> 00:34:37,681
Yeah, yeah. Cheers.

733
00:34:42,286 --> 00:34:43,286
Okay.

734
00:34:44,322 --> 00:34:45,887
Don't cry.

735
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:47,123
Huh?

736
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:50,193
At the airport.
You know what Mum's like.

737
00:34:50,195 --> 00:34:51,696
If you're crying,
she'll start crying

738
00:34:51,698 --> 00:34:54,131
and then you're not gonna
wanna go, are you?

739
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,533
So just put your hood up,
don't look back.

740
00:34:58,071 --> 00:34:59,505
Okay.

741
00:35:22,431 --> 00:35:24,197
- Bye.
- Bye.

742
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:25,868
- Bye.
- Bye.

743
00:35:27,435 --> 00:35:28,768
Oh, God.

744
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:30,506
Come on.
You're all right. Be strong.

745
00:35:37,512 --> 00:35:39,446
I really wish Zak
was coming with me.

746
00:35:39,448 --> 00:35:40,884
Yeah, we all do, love.

747
00:35:42,819 --> 00:35:44,219
Can you take care of him?

748
00:35:44,221 --> 00:35:45,420
He'll be all right.

749
00:35:45,422 --> 00:35:47,855
He's the tough one
of the family.

750
00:35:47,857 --> 00:35:49,691
When I was living on
the streets, I didn't think...

751
00:35:49,693 --> 00:35:51,561
I'd be lucky enough
to have kids.

752
00:35:51,563 --> 00:35:55,766
Let alone one with the talent
to get bloody rich and famous.

753
00:35:55,768 --> 00:35:57,900
You go get it, baby, okay.
You're amazing.

754
00:35:57,902 --> 00:35:59,471
You're absolutely amazing.

755
00:36:01,941 --> 00:36:04,375
You're gonna be a star, babe.

756
00:36:04,377 --> 00:36:05,442
Okay, I'm gonna go.

757
00:36:05,444 --> 00:36:06,609
- Go on.
- Don't go.

758
00:36:06,611 --> 00:36:08,947
- I love you. I love you.
- Proud of you, babe.

759
00:36:08,949 --> 00:36:10,749
Bye, Raya.

760
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,282
Love you, Ray.

761
00:36:13,954 --> 00:36:16,724
Love you, babe.
I love you, princess.

762
00:36:18,191 --> 00:36:19,792
We're proud
of you, darling.

763
00:36:19,794 --> 00:36:21,160
Come on, babe.

764
00:36:21,162 --> 00:36:23,595
Love you!
We're gonna miss you!

765
00:36:23,597 --> 00:36:25,433
You're gonna be amazing.

766
00:37:38,014 --> 00:37:39,079
Hey.

767
00:37:39,081 --> 00:37:40,183
Hey.

768
00:37:41,483 --> 00:37:43,517
- NXT?
- Uh, yeah, hi.

769
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:45,419
- Us, too. How's it going?
- Good.

770
00:37:45,421 --> 00:37:49,256
I'm all right.
Long flight. Tired. Hi.

771
00:37:49,258 --> 00:37:51,158
- Oh, I'm Kirsten.
- Hi.

772
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,362
- Hi, I'm Jeri-Lynn. Hi.
- Oh. Hi.

773
00:37:53,364 --> 00:37:55,764
- Hey, I'm Madison.
- Hi. I'm Saraya.

774
00:37:55,766 --> 00:37:58,567
No, Britani. Wait, Paige.

775
00:37:58,569 --> 00:37:59,768
I love your accent.

776
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,406
You sound
like a Nazi in a movie.

777
00:38:02,172 --> 00:38:04,173
Oh, thank you.

778
00:38:04,175 --> 00:38:05,408
Thank you.

779
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,577
I love
that. Say something else.

780
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:08,711
Like what?

781
00:38:08,713 --> 00:38:11,448
Uh, anything.
Here. Read something.

782
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,083
Okay.

783
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:14,784
Uh...

784
00:38:14,786 --> 00:38:17,755
"The sudden fire claimed
the lives of five orphans."

785
00:38:17,757 --> 00:38:19,623
I love it.

786
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:21,425
"The charred remains
of the children

787
00:38:21,427 --> 00:38:23,562
could only be identified
from dental records."

788
00:38:23,564 --> 00:38:26,064
- So sexy, right?
- So sexy.

789
00:38:26,066 --> 00:38:28,369
I am so jealous
of you right now.

790
00:38:29,202 --> 00:38:30,271
Thank you.

791
00:38:56,399 --> 00:38:57,401
Welcome.

792
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:00,604
Well, this is where
we assess you...

793
00:39:00,606 --> 00:39:03,472
and see whether or not
you get to go on to WWE.

794
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:06,374
Look to your left.
To your right.

795
00:39:06,376 --> 00:39:07,742
Before you leave Orlando,

796
00:39:07,744 --> 00:39:09,946
at least one of you
will be a stripper.

797
00:39:09,948 --> 00:39:12,582
How many of you wanna be
on the WWE main roster?

798
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:13,750
Yes, Coach!

799
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:15,852
Would you like to be
WWE World Champion?

800
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,254
Yes, Coach!

801
00:39:17,256 --> 00:39:18,522
What I'm determined
to find out is,

802
00:39:18,524 --> 00:39:20,124
do you want it bad enough...

803
00:39:20,126 --> 00:39:22,126
to push your ass
past what you think

804
00:39:22,128 --> 00:39:23,862
you're physically capable of?

805
00:39:23,864 --> 00:39:24,996
Yes, Coach!

806
00:39:24,998 --> 00:39:26,197
There's two ways out.

807
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:29,602
Either I cut you,
or you ask for the horn.

808
00:39:29,604 --> 00:39:30,803
Because you know

809
00:39:30,805 --> 00:39:32,937
that you got yourself
in over your head.

810
00:39:32,939 --> 00:39:35,174
All you gotta do is squeeze
it, makes it all stop.

811
00:39:35,176 --> 00:39:36,774
- Would you like the horn?
- No, Coach!

812
00:39:36,776 --> 00:39:37,943
- You.
- No, Coach.

813
00:39:37,945 --> 00:39:39,579
- Anybody want the horn?
- No, Coach!

814
00:39:39,581 --> 00:39:44,284
Good! Welcome to the suck.
Let's have some fun.

815
00:39:45,721 --> 00:39:46,822
Go!

816
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,557
Set!

817
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:51,495
Keep moving, guys.
Keep moving.

818
00:39:54,798 --> 00:39:55,963
Down!

819
00:39:55,965 --> 00:39:57,033
Up!

820
00:39:57,835 --> 00:39:59,402
Down!

821
00:39:59,404 --> 00:40:01,172
Bump! And again!

822
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:04,072
- Squeeze the horn and go home!
- No, Coach!

823
00:40:04,074 --> 00:40:05,143
- Squeeze the horn!
- No!

824
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,916
<i>I ain't goin' back
Till the bottle runs dry</i>

825
00:40:13,918 --> 00:40:16,251
<i>I ain't goin' back</i>

826
00:40:16,253 --> 00:40:20,492
<i>Till the car gets high
I ain't goin' back</i>

827
00:40:21,527 --> 00:40:23,826
If I do shake your hand,

828
00:40:23,828 --> 00:40:25,668
that means this is
the end of the line for you.

829
00:40:28,268 --> 00:40:29,536
Thank you for your time.

830
00:40:35,074 --> 00:40:36,676
I'll see the rest
of you tomorrow.

831
00:40:38,046 --> 00:40:39,611
Barry's gone.

832
00:40:39,613 --> 00:40:42,080
Take the wrist.

833
00:40:42,082 --> 00:40:46,418
Swing under and take the head.

834
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,890
Good. And again. Come on.

835
00:40:52,462 --> 00:40:55,595
Push, push!
Okay, dig deep!

836
00:40:57,232 --> 00:40:59,066
Get on your feet.
Get on your feet.

837
00:40:59,068 --> 00:41:00,069
Are we done here?

838
00:41:02,205 --> 00:41:03,973
All right,
go to the locker room.

839
00:41:05,377 --> 00:41:07,275
Come on, Paige.
Push it, push it up.

840
00:41:07,277 --> 00:41:09,145
What if you gotta do
a belly-to-back suplex

841
00:41:09,147 --> 00:41:10,378
and lift someone?

842
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,579
You can't lift them,
you drop them

843
00:41:11,581 --> 00:41:12,949
on their head.
You'll break their neck.

844
00:41:12,951 --> 00:41:14,282
You'll give me a shit-ton
of paperwork.

845
00:41:14,284 --> 00:41:16,586
I hate paperwork.
I can barely write, Paige.

846
00:41:16,588 --> 00:41:17,921
Push it!

847
00:41:19,892 --> 00:41:23,426
Keep going! Nice, big,
long push, Courtney!

848
00:41:23,428 --> 00:41:25,128
Come on! Good girl.

849
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,964
Come on!

850
00:41:26,966 --> 00:41:29,766
A nice, long, deep push.

851
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,420
<i>Good morning,
wrestling nerds.</i>

852
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:48,754
Good morning, Coach!

853
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,522
Welcome to promo class.

854
00:41:50,524 --> 00:41:52,491
Now, as you all know,
wrestling is storytelling.

855
00:41:52,493 --> 00:41:54,996
It is soap opera in spandex.

856
00:41:54,998 --> 00:41:58,532
Good versus evil.
Babyface versus heel.

857
00:41:58,534 --> 00:41:59,633
We do a lot
of our storytelling

858
00:41:59,635 --> 00:42:00,733
in the ring with wrestling...

859
00:42:00,735 --> 00:42:01,836
but equally as important,

860
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:04,138
you must be able
to storytell on the mic.

861
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,040
This is an essential part
of being able

862
00:42:06,042 --> 00:42:07,808
to get over with the fans.

863
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:10,812
This is your opportunity
to let them know who you are.

864
00:42:10,814 --> 00:42:12,548
Tell them what you're about.

865
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:15,550
The WWE can put you
on the main roster...

866
00:42:15,552 --> 00:42:17,989
but only the fans
can keep you there.

867
00:42:18,922 --> 00:42:20,822
Who wants to go first?

868
00:42:20,824 --> 00:42:23,294
My name is Jeri-Lynn.

869
00:42:23,296 --> 00:42:25,495
And I may look like
the girl next door...

870
00:42:25,497 --> 00:42:28,866
but underneath this
is a firecracker.

871
00:42:28,868 --> 00:42:31,235
And I am going to blow you...

872
00:42:31,237 --> 00:42:34,038
- Excuse me?
- ...out of the water!

873
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,306
My 10-year-old just

874
00:42:35,308 --> 00:42:36,706
asked me some questions
I don't wanna answer.

875
00:42:36,708 --> 00:42:37,809
- Let's put it together.
- Yeah.

876
00:42:37,811 --> 00:42:38,976
- Let's keep it one.
- Of course.

877
00:42:38,978 --> 00:42:40,979
My name is Augustus Heights.

878
00:42:40,981 --> 00:42:43,314
- Augustus?
- Augustus Heights.

879
00:42:43,316 --> 00:42:44,649
Are you a polo player?

880
00:42:44,651 --> 00:42:46,285
- Uh, no.
- Are you gonna

881
00:42:46,287 --> 00:42:47,687
- come out in full polo garb?
- No.

882
00:42:47,689 --> 00:42:48,821
How did you come up
with Augustus Heights?

883
00:42:48,823 --> 00:42:49,888
It's my name.

884
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:51,023
- Is it really?
- Yeah.

885
00:42:51,025 --> 00:42:52,391
Okay, let's go again.

886
00:42:52,393 --> 00:42:54,161
My name is Augustus Heights.

887
00:42:54,163 --> 00:42:55,929
Are you a guy who's going
to inherit a beer company?

888
00:42:55,931 --> 00:42:57,230
No.

889
00:42:57,232 --> 00:42:58,398
Let's come up
with a wrestling name.

890
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,632
Augustus Heights
feels like a guy

891
00:42:59,634 --> 00:43:01,936
who's gonna politely
ask me for some butter.

892
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:06,106
My name is Paige.
And I am all the rage.

893
00:43:06,108 --> 00:43:08,542
Girls wanna be me.
Guys wanna get to know me.

894
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,879
May sound like bragging,
but it ain't if it's true.

895
00:43:10,881 --> 00:43:12,781
It ain't about the size
of the dog in the fight...

896
00:43:12,783 --> 00:43:14,348
it's about the size
of the fight in the dog.

897
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:17,454
And this dog
is about to bite hard!

898
00:43:18,621 --> 00:43:19,789
I love it.

899
00:43:19,791 --> 00:43:21,023
Yeah?

900
00:43:21,025 --> 00:43:22,691
When I heard it 20 years ago.

901
00:43:22,693 --> 00:43:25,262
Those are like lines
you could get off a Dixie cup.

902
00:43:25,264 --> 00:43:27,597
Well, people liked it
in Norwich, so...

903
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:28,799
Yeah, but here
they have cable,

904
00:43:28,801 --> 00:43:30,167
and running water,
and electricity...

905
00:43:30,169 --> 00:43:32,134
and they would've heard
their 5-year-old brother...

906
00:43:32,136 --> 00:43:33,404
use it at a dinner table.

907
00:43:33,406 --> 00:43:34,538
You go out and you take that

908
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:35,906
in front of
a live crowd here...

909
00:43:35,908 --> 00:43:37,607
it's like throwing a pork chop
to a bunch of hyenas.

910
00:43:37,609 --> 00:43:38,976
They're gonna chew you up.

911
00:43:38,978 --> 00:43:41,546
You gotta find something
that's specific to you.

912
00:43:41,548 --> 00:43:44,215
Something that only
you can say.

913
00:43:44,217 --> 00:43:45,885
All right, let's go. Next.

914
00:43:47,153 --> 00:43:49,154
My name is Nick Barnes.

915
00:43:49,156 --> 00:43:51,857
For those of you who don't
know me, let me fill you in.

916
00:43:51,859 --> 00:43:53,091
Where I come from...

917
00:43:53,093 --> 00:43:54,826
...you have to work hard
to get what you want.

918
00:43:54,828 --> 00:43:59,168
But what I see here is a bunch
of lazy wannabe wrestlers.

919
00:44:03,271 --> 00:44:05,775
- I say, do it!
- Do it? Yeah?

920
00:44:10,312 --> 00:44:11,347
All right.

921
00:44:28,834 --> 00:44:30,267
<i>Go for Hutch.</i>

922
00:44:30,269 --> 00:44:33,570
<i>Hello, Mr. Morgan?
It's Zak Zodiac calling again.</i>

923
00:44:33,572 --> 00:44:35,707
Just wanted to check up
on the tape.

924
00:44:36,509 --> 00:44:37,674
<i>We reviewed your tape,</i>

925
00:44:37,676 --> 00:44:40,177
<i>and we were
all very impressed.</i>

926
00:44:40,179 --> 00:44:41,545
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, thank you.

927
00:44:41,547 --> 00:44:43,183
That means a lot. Thank you.

928
00:44:44,382 --> 00:44:47,521
<i>But the, uh,
answer is still no.</i>

929
00:44:50,825 --> 00:44:53,358
Could I speak to someone else,
please, sir?

930
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,361
Someone higher up maybe.

931
00:44:55,363 --> 00:44:57,065
<i>I'm afraid not.</i>

932
00:44:58,834 --> 00:45:02,034
Sir, I don't think
you understand. Um...

933
00:45:02,036 --> 00:45:03,703
You see,
this is my dream, this.

934
00:45:03,705 --> 00:45:05,305
I do understand.

935
00:45:05,307 --> 00:45:07,008
<i>No, no, you don't.</i>

936
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:08,976
Look, I have a kid now, sir,

937
00:45:08,978 --> 00:45:12,579
and I've made
my girlfriend promises.

938
00:45:12,581 --> 00:45:15,015
We're looking
for something you don't have.

939
00:45:15,017 --> 00:45:16,917
What's that, then?

940
00:45:16,919 --> 00:45:18,486
Something extra.

941
00:45:18,488 --> 00:45:20,388
- Something extra?
- <i>A spark.</i>

942
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:23,390
I have that. I've got that
in buckets, mate.

943
00:45:23,392 --> 00:45:24,659
<i>No, you don't.</i>

944
00:45:24,661 --> 00:45:26,030
Yes, I do. I do.

945
00:45:26,931 --> 00:45:27,999
<i>No, you don't.</i>

946
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:30,735
And what? But my sister does?

947
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:35,604
Let it go, son.

948
00:45:35,606 --> 00:45:38,941
Please, please don't do this.
All right. Don't do this.

949
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,109
<i>Let it go.</i>

950
00:45:40,111 --> 00:45:41,444
I can't. I can't let it go

951
00:45:41,446 --> 00:45:43,783
because this is all
I can do, right?

952
00:45:45,217 --> 00:45:48,186
Then you'll have
to find something else.

953
00:45:48,188 --> 00:45:49,920
- <i>Goodbye.</i>
- I...

954
00:45:56,229 --> 00:45:57,597
Jesus...

955
00:46:14,985 --> 00:46:17,617
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

956
00:46:17,619 --> 00:46:18,753
You're supposed to pull it,

957
00:46:18,755 --> 00:46:20,220
not actually kick me
in the ovaries.

958
00:46:20,222 --> 00:46:21,723
I'm sorry.

959
00:46:21,725 --> 00:46:23,893
Okay. Doesn't matter.
Let's go again.

960
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:28,730
Oh, my...

961
00:46:28,732 --> 00:46:29,964
I'm so sorry.

962
00:46:29,966 --> 00:46:31,967
- What was that?
- It was a mistake.

963
00:46:31,969 --> 00:46:33,168
Yeah, no, I know wrestlers

964
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:34,737
that are paralyzed
from mistakes.

965
00:46:34,739 --> 00:46:36,439
Where did you wrestle before?

966
00:46:36,441 --> 00:46:37,673
I didn't.

967
00:46:37,675 --> 00:46:38,943
So, what did you do?

968
00:46:39,811 --> 00:46:40,980
I was a model.

969
00:46:42,647 --> 00:46:45,015
Okay, um...

970
00:46:45,017 --> 00:46:47,852
Right. You need to look at me
so I know when to move.

971
00:46:47,854 --> 00:46:49,087
Okay.

972
00:46:54,862 --> 00:46:56,697
- Oh, my God!
- Jesus!

973
00:46:57,998 --> 00:46:59,197
What happened?

974
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:01,198
She slapped her.
Like a for-real slap.

975
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,035
No. It was a receipt.

976
00:47:03,037 --> 00:47:04,937
- Looked like a slap.
- It's called a receipt.

977
00:47:04,939 --> 00:47:06,671
You botch a move,
you get a receipt.

978
00:47:06,673 --> 00:47:08,607
- All right, apologize.
- For what?

979
00:47:08,609 --> 00:47:09,943
Receipts are important.

980
00:47:09,945 --> 00:47:11,545
It teaches you not to make
the same mistake twice.

981
00:47:11,547 --> 00:47:13,847
We don't give receipts here.
I said apologize.

982
00:47:13,849 --> 00:47:16,048
Well, you should. They'd
pick things up a lot quicker.

983
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:17,217
When I was learning,

984
00:47:17,219 --> 00:47:18,784
I got loads of receipts
from my brother.

985
00:47:18,786 --> 00:47:20,488
This isn't some inbred,
backyard wrestling unit.

986
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:21,689
This is the NXT.

987
00:47:21,691 --> 00:47:23,825
We don't do the receipt stuff
around here.

988
00:47:23,827 --> 00:47:25,359
So, if I ask you to apologize

989
00:47:25,361 --> 00:47:27,160
or do anything else,
I expect you to do it.

990
00:47:27,162 --> 00:47:28,395
I was just teaching her
how to...

991
00:47:28,397 --> 00:47:31,069
Paige, I just asked you
to apologize!

992
00:47:34,505 --> 00:47:36,237
I'm sorry.

993
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:37,375
It's fine.

994
00:47:39,711 --> 00:47:42,180
All right. Get back at it.

995
00:47:46,684 --> 00:47:47,851
You okay?

996
00:47:47,853 --> 00:47:49,152
Yeah.
You wanna switch up?

997
00:47:49,154 --> 00:47:51,221
Yeah, yeah,
I'll switch in.

998
00:47:51,223 --> 00:47:53,690
<i>I miss
you all so much.</i>

999
00:47:53,692 --> 00:47:56,192
I just lie awake, thinking
about what you're all doing.

1000
00:47:56,194 --> 00:47:58,363
I haven't even met Caden yet!

1001
00:47:58,365 --> 00:48:00,097
You ain't missing much,
just shitting and pissing.

1002
00:48:00,099 --> 00:48:01,932
<i>How's
the training, love?</i>

1003
00:48:01,934 --> 00:48:03,101
It's really hard.

1004
00:48:03,103 --> 00:48:04,302
<i>I mean,
it's meant to be hard.</i>

1005
00:48:04,304 --> 00:48:06,106
If it was easy, any
poor bastard could do it.

1006
00:48:07,442 --> 00:48:08,841
What's
your competition like?

1007
00:48:08,843 --> 00:48:11,109
Hmm. All the other
girls are gorgeous.

1008
00:48:11,111 --> 00:48:12,277
<i>Yeah, they've probably
been chosen</i>

1009
00:48:12,279 --> 00:48:13,645
<i>for their looks, unlike you.</i>

1010
00:48:13,647 --> 00:48:15,714
- Thanks, Mum.
- <i>No, I don't mean that, do I?</i>

1011
00:48:15,716 --> 00:48:16,983
I just mean that WWE,

1012
00:48:16,985 --> 00:48:19,186
they take on models
and cheerleaders and girls

1013
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:20,353
that just wanna get famous

1014
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:21,787
jiggling their
tits and their ass.

1015
00:48:21,789 --> 00:48:23,557
<i>They don't have girls with
wrestling experience like you.</i>

1016
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:25,025
<i>You're gonna blow them
out of the water.</i>

1017
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,361
Maybe.

1018
00:48:26,363 --> 00:48:28,263
<i>Ever since we
announced you'd been signed...</i>

1019
00:48:28,265 --> 00:48:31,765
<i>it has gone absolutely
mental over here.</i>

1020
00:48:31,767 --> 00:48:34,067
<i>We are selling
a ton of merchandise.</i>

1021
00:48:34,069 --> 00:48:35,071
What merchandise?

1022
00:48:38,375 --> 00:48:39,442
Who's that?

1023
00:48:39,444 --> 00:48:41,110
- It's you, innit?
- You.

1024
00:48:41,112 --> 00:48:42,280
Who's making them?

1025
00:48:45,148 --> 00:48:46,582
Are you running a sweatshop?

1026
00:48:46,584 --> 00:48:48,283
It is not a sweatshop!

1027
00:48:48,285 --> 00:48:49,953
Nah, in a sweatshop,
you get paid.

1028
00:48:49,955 --> 00:48:53,223
All right,
no more rice for you, huh?

1029
00:48:53,225 --> 00:48:54,624
Hey, babe...

1030
00:48:54,626 --> 00:48:56,326
<i>number one best-selling item.</i>

1031
00:48:56,328 --> 00:48:57,494
Ho-ho.

1032
00:48:57,496 --> 00:48:58,762
Signed picture.

1033
00:48:58,764 --> 00:48:59,864
But who's signing them?

1034
00:48:59,866 --> 00:49:02,132
Who do you think? I got RSI.

1035
00:49:02,134 --> 00:49:04,836
<i>Yeah, but that is
from wanking, not writing.</i>

1036
00:49:04,838 --> 00:49:06,838
Wait. Guys, "Paige"
should have an "I" in it.

1037
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,640
<i>Should it?</i>

1038
00:49:08,642 --> 00:49:11,010
<i>Puh, ah... Ah, yeah.</i>

1039
00:49:11,012 --> 00:49:13,010
<i>Yeah. It doesn't matter.</i>

1040
00:49:13,012 --> 00:49:14,681
None of our fans
can read anyway.

1041
00:49:14,683 --> 00:49:17,415
<i>Listen, I had a brainwave
about the Christmassacre.</i>

1042
00:49:17,417 --> 00:49:20,654
<i>Zak Zodiac versus the WWE's...</i>

1043
00:49:20,656 --> 00:49:23,355
<i>- Paige!
- Paige!</i>

1044
00:49:23,357 --> 00:49:25,091
I don't know, Dad.
I'm not sure.

1045
00:49:25,093 --> 00:49:26,193
<i>You're gonna win.</i>

1046
00:49:26,195 --> 00:49:27,361
The fans will love it.

1047
00:49:27,363 --> 00:49:28,894
What do you think, Zak?

1048
00:49:28,896 --> 00:49:31,698
Zak loves the idea! We sold
a lot of tickets, babe.

1049
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,667
Wait, you sold tickets?
Without telling me?

1050
00:49:33,669 --> 00:49:36,638
We're telling you now.

1051
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,540
<i>Look at that. Look at that!
That's all you.</i>

1052
00:49:39,542 --> 00:49:41,009
<i>You should be proud.</i>

1053
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:42,978
<i>You're doing that
for your family.</i>

1054
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,445
Now, imagine you get
on the main roster. Huh?

1055
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,650
We'll make millions!

1056
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:49,784
What if I don't get
on the main roster?

1057
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:53,122
<i>What? Don't talk
like that, darling.</i>

1058
00:49:53,124 --> 00:49:57,093
<i>Look, you just work hard,
yeah? Keep focused.</i>

1059
00:49:57,095 --> 00:49:59,194
<i>We're all proud of you.
We believe in you.</i>

1060
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:00,997
<i>Yeah. Bye, babe.</i>

1061
00:50:00,999 --> 00:50:02,833
- <i>Love you, Raya! We love you!</i>
- Bye.

1062
00:50:02,835 --> 00:50:04,670
<i>Bye! Love you!</i>

1063
00:50:11,845 --> 00:50:13,845
He's not
the smartest cookie.

1064
00:50:13,847 --> 00:50:16,214
Yeah, he's been dropped
on his head too many times.

1065
00:50:16,216 --> 00:50:18,216
Hey!

1066
00:50:18,218 --> 00:50:21,487
I just wanted
to explain the receipt.

1067
00:50:21,489 --> 00:50:25,058
I got a bit nervous,
because Kirsten...

1068
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,559
up until a few months ago,
she was just a model.

1069
00:50:27,561 --> 00:50:29,929
Sometimes,
WWE, they hire girls...

1070
00:50:29,931 --> 00:50:31,664
who just wanna
jiggle their tits and ass

1071
00:50:31,666 --> 00:50:33,167
and get famous, basically.

1072
00:50:33,169 --> 00:50:35,672
Like cheerleaders, models,
dancers, whatever.

1073
00:50:36,372 --> 00:50:37,374
I was a model.

1074
00:50:38,374 --> 00:50:39,539
Ah, right.

1075
00:50:39,541 --> 00:50:40,543
Cheerleader.

1076
00:50:42,045 --> 00:50:43,677
Cool.

1077
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:46,183
Well, at least you're
not dancers.

1078
00:50:50,122 --> 00:50:51,290
I'm...

1079
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:54,926
See you later!

1080
00:50:56,193 --> 00:50:57,526
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1081
00:50:57,528 --> 00:50:59,128
<i>...we are NXT!</i>

1082
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:02,265
<i>And the future is now!</i>

1083
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:04,600
<i>Introducing
to the WWE Universe</i>

1084
00:51:04,602 --> 00:51:05,969
<i>for the very first time...</i>

1085
00:51:05,971 --> 00:51:08,304
<i>Madison!</i>

1086
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:16,914
<i>Please welcome Jeri-Lynn!</i>

1087
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:22,390
<i>Welcome Kirsten!</i>

1088
00:51:23,189 --> 00:51:24,758
I love you, Kirsten!

1089
00:51:26,394 --> 00:51:28,762
<i>All the way from the UK...</i>

1090
00:51:28,764 --> 00:51:32,965
<i>Paige!</i>

1091
00:51:39,776 --> 00:51:41,341
Yeah, this is
what I paid for,

1092
00:51:41,343 --> 00:51:43,310
three hot chicks
and my dead grandmother.

1093
00:51:45,348 --> 00:51:46,613
Look on the bright side.

1094
00:51:46,615 --> 00:51:48,784
At least
she's not in a bikini.

1095
00:51:50,987 --> 00:51:55,123
And now it's time for the WWE
Divas Promo Challenge!

1096
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:05,801
My name is Kirsten.

1097
00:52:05,803 --> 00:52:10,540
And I'm the future of NXT.

1098
00:52:10,542 --> 00:52:13,844
And the future looks good!

1099
00:52:15,614 --> 00:52:18,450
But what can I say
about Paige?

1100
00:52:18,452 --> 00:52:20,151
Where's your black cat?

1101
00:52:20,153 --> 00:52:22,323
I could say, I'm gonna
rearrange your teeth.

1102
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:24,323
Ooh!

1103
00:52:24,325 --> 00:52:27,460
But you're British,
I'd be doing you a favor!

1104
00:52:30,998 --> 00:52:33,531
Now, the world
can be a very dark place.

1105
00:52:33,533 --> 00:52:37,637
That's why people
want sunshine and glamour.

1106
00:52:37,639 --> 00:52:41,541
Which is why I'm gonna stick
your broomstick up your butt

1107
00:52:41,543 --> 00:52:44,744
and fly you home to Hogwarts!

1108
00:52:56,193 --> 00:52:57,559
What you got?

1109
00:53:01,932 --> 00:53:04,334
Come on, Ozzy Osbourne!

1110
00:53:04,336 --> 00:53:05,535
Sing something!

1111
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:14,244
Speak! The power
of Christ compels you!

1112
00:53:14,246 --> 00:53:16,547
We can't hear you!

1113
00:53:16,549 --> 00:53:19,250
We can't hear you!

1114
00:53:19,252 --> 00:53:21,786
We can't hear you!

1115
00:53:21,788 --> 00:53:23,789
We can't hear you!

1116
00:53:23,791 --> 00:53:25,624
You just suck!

1117
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,930
Freak!

1118
00:53:37,105 --> 00:53:38,804
Yeah, gonna have to
get used to it, though.

1119
00:53:38,806 --> 00:53:40,486
- Yeah.
- Yeah, absolutely.

1120
00:53:41,576 --> 00:53:42,578
Hey, you okay?

1121
00:53:44,479 --> 00:53:45,548
Mmm-hmm.

1122
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,463
Jesus Christ, Zak!

1123
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,791
<i>Hello! You've reached Zak.
Please leave a message.</i>

1124
00:55:17,682 --> 00:55:19,642
Zak's here, Zak's here!
Y'all, let's go, let's go.

1125
00:55:22,087 --> 00:55:23,807
All right, let's go.
Come on! Let's do this!

1126
00:55:28,429 --> 00:55:30,229
What's going on?

1127
00:55:32,733 --> 00:55:33,832
Why'd he just leave like that?

1128
00:55:33,834 --> 00:55:34,899
Dude?

1129
00:55:34,901 --> 00:55:36,166
Guys, we're not wrestling.

1130
00:55:36,168 --> 00:55:37,369
I take it
we're not wrestling today.

1131
00:55:37,371 --> 00:55:38,603
Yeah.

1132
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:33,429
- Hey!
- Hey!

1133
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:35,099
Hey!

1134
00:56:35,101 --> 00:56:36,635
You're blonde!

1135
00:56:36,637 --> 00:56:37,803
Yeah.

1136
00:56:37,805 --> 00:56:39,937
Thought I'd
change it up a bit.

1137
00:56:39,939 --> 00:56:41,472
Who did it?

1138
00:56:41,474 --> 00:56:42,774
I did it myself.

1139
00:56:42,776 --> 00:56:43,841
- Really?
- Last night, yeah.

1140
00:56:43,843 --> 00:56:45,647
- Right on.
- Nice!

1141
00:56:46,313 --> 00:56:47,480
And you're so tan!

1142
00:56:47,482 --> 00:56:48,813
I did that myself, too.

1143
00:56:48,815 --> 00:56:50,583
- Looks so natural.
- Nice!

1144
00:56:50,585 --> 00:56:52,250
It's good to change it up.

1145
00:56:52,252 --> 00:56:53,692
- Yeah.
- Sometimes, I wanna do that.

1146
00:56:55,157 --> 00:56:56,492
Did someone break up with you?

1147
00:56:57,358 --> 00:56:58,593
No.

1148
00:57:03,032 --> 00:57:04,165
Whatever.

1149
00:57:04,167 --> 00:57:05,266
Well, should we load up?

1150
00:57:05,268 --> 00:57:06,366
Yeah!

1151
00:57:06,368 --> 00:57:07,704
Yeah, we'll go get a seat.

1152
00:57:13,845 --> 00:57:16,945
This is our last day
before the holiday!

1153
00:57:16,947 --> 00:57:18,981
I'm not gonna have
your asses for a week!

1154
00:57:18,983 --> 00:57:22,883
So, please, show me
that you wanna be here!

1155
00:57:30,895 --> 00:57:32,230
Fight for it!

1156
00:57:42,074 --> 00:57:43,908
Come on!
Get her out of the ring!

1157
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:46,379
Let me see
how bad you want it!

1158
00:57:52,987 --> 00:57:54,586
Next group up!

1159
00:58:00,362 --> 00:58:02,562
Don't be shy with those!

1160
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:09,236
You wanna headline
<i>WrestleMania.</i>

1161
00:58:09,238 --> 00:58:11,574
You wanna be Divas Champion,
then show me!

1162
00:58:15,946 --> 00:58:17,047
All right, come on, ladies!

1163
00:58:22,119 --> 00:58:25,722
Here we go! Look who got
a makeover to come in last!

1164
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:29,358
Come on! You look
like a snow leopard!

1165
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,127
Thank God for
the camouflage pants

1166
00:58:31,129 --> 00:58:33,132
so the hunters can't see you
in the sand!

1167
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,433
Flip the tire three times!

1168
00:58:39,136 --> 00:58:41,208
Three times!
Come on, English, let's go!

1169
00:58:54,654 --> 00:58:57,589
That's two. Come on.

1170
00:58:57,591 --> 00:58:58,656
How're you gonna flip a girl

1171
00:58:58,658 --> 00:58:59,992
five nights
a week in a ring...

1172
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:03,965
if you can't even flip
a vulcanized rubber circle?

1173
00:59:08,536 --> 00:59:09,937
Oh, shit! I can't!

1174
00:59:09,939 --> 00:59:12,439
I can't...

1175
00:59:16,979 --> 00:59:18,219
Put yourself
out of your misery.

1176
00:59:30,829 --> 00:59:33,265
Next group up!
Bar's been lowered!

1177
00:59:50,718 --> 00:59:53,051
I don't even know
if I wanna be here anymore.

1178
00:59:53,053 --> 00:59:54,618
Talk about me again
behind my back...

1179
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:56,053
and I swear I'll give you
more than a receipt.

1180
00:59:56,055 --> 00:59:57,456
I wasn't talking about you.

1181
00:59:57,458 --> 00:59:58,657
You are so fake.

1182
00:59:58,659 --> 00:59:59,891
- No one was talking about you.
- Oh, my God.

1183
00:59:59,893 --> 01:00:01,527
- I saw you!
- We weren't talking about you!

1184
01:00:01,529 --> 01:00:02,628
What, do you think I'm stupid?

1185
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:04,163
I've been sat right there
just watching you!

1186
01:00:04,165 --> 01:00:05,667
We're talking about her.

1187
01:00:07,202 --> 01:00:08,367
Who is she?

1188
01:00:08,369 --> 01:00:09,903
My daughter...

1189
01:00:09,905 --> 01:00:12,004
who I haven't seen in four
months because I'm here...

1190
01:00:12,006 --> 01:00:15,010
putting up with your shit,
so she can have a better life.

1191
01:00:16,245 --> 01:00:17,511
I didn't know
you had a daughter.

1192
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:20,580
No, you don't know
anything about me.

1193
01:00:20,582 --> 01:00:22,685
Or them, or about our lives,
or why we're here.

1194
01:00:23,719 --> 01:00:25,988
Well, you never told me.

1195
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:27,689
You never asked.

1196
01:00:27,691 --> 01:00:29,256
Why would you?

1197
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:30,458
We're just
tits and ass, right?

1198
01:00:54,521 --> 01:00:56,356
Well,
the girls took a vote.

1199
01:00:58,792 --> 01:01:01,127
You're the homecoming queen.

1200
01:01:02,562 --> 01:01:03,564
Thanks.

1201
01:01:06,132 --> 01:01:08,436
How do you think
this ends for you?

1202
01:01:11,473 --> 01:01:14,874
On the main roster.
Divas Champion.

1203
01:01:14,876 --> 01:01:16,209
You realize that today

1204
01:01:16,211 --> 01:01:18,412
was about proving
that you deserve that.

1205
01:01:18,414 --> 01:01:19,415
Right?

1206
01:01:21,383 --> 01:01:22,749
I'll start proving myself

1207
01:01:22,751 --> 01:01:25,485
when you put me
with real wrestlers.

1208
01:01:25,487 --> 01:01:27,623
Wrestlers like my brother.

1209
01:01:28,625 --> 01:01:30,926
Your brother's a journeyman.

1210
01:01:30,928 --> 01:01:32,827
- No.
- Yes.

1211
01:01:32,829 --> 01:01:35,430
- No!
- There are stars...

1212
01:01:35,432 --> 01:01:36,932
and there's journeymen
who take the hits...

1213
01:01:36,934 --> 01:01:38,166
that make the stars look good.

1214
01:01:38,168 --> 01:01:39,734
And your brother's
a journeyman.

1215
01:01:39,736 --> 01:01:41,003
He's the punching bag.

1216
01:01:41,005 --> 01:01:43,639
He's the guy with the bad
shorts with no fanfare.

1217
01:01:43,641 --> 01:01:44,975
No, you bring him here...

1218
01:01:44,977 --> 01:01:48,178
I bring him out here
and then what?

1219
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:50,480
We put him on the road
for 200 days a year?

1220
01:01:50,482 --> 01:01:53,184
He's chasing fame that's
never gonna come to him?

1221
01:01:53,186 --> 01:01:55,084
His wife starts screwing
the garbage man

1222
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,586
'cause he's never around?

1223
01:01:56,588 --> 01:01:59,691
His kid can't remember
his face, and for what?

1224
01:01:59,693 --> 01:02:02,627
Maybe he'd get a shot
at a pay-per-view event.

1225
01:02:02,629 --> 01:02:04,428
And he would try so hard
to make an impression...

1226
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:06,098
he'd probably let
a real star...

1227
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:09,567
throw him off a 30-foot cage
onto a concrete floor.

1228
01:02:09,569 --> 01:02:11,070
Have his shoulder bone...

1229
01:02:11,072 --> 01:02:13,005
just kinda splice right
through his rotator cuff...

1230
01:02:13,007 --> 01:02:14,941
tear it clean in half.

1231
01:02:14,943 --> 01:02:16,309
And then the doctor would say,

1232
01:02:16,311 --> 01:02:19,378
"That's it. Your
wrestling career is over."

1233
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:21,281
But why quit then?
He wouldn't stop.

1234
01:02:21,283 --> 01:02:24,218
So then the wife would
leave him and take the kid.

1235
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:25,886
And then, he would just keep
chasing the pipe dream...

1236
01:02:25,888 --> 01:02:29,156
until he'd end up
4,000 miles away

1237
01:02:29,158 --> 01:02:30,891
from anyone
that ever loved him.

1238
01:02:30,893 --> 01:02:33,327
He'd be bitter,
and he'd be mean.

1239
01:02:34,498 --> 01:02:37,065
And he'd be all by himself...

1240
01:02:37,067 --> 01:02:38,900
just wishing that, God,
he could get his kid

1241
01:02:38,902 --> 01:02:40,872
to return his phone call.

1242
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:45,341
Is that the life that you want
for your brother?

1243
01:02:45,343 --> 01:02:47,712
No, I know that
wouldn't happen to Zak.

1244
01:02:49,313 --> 01:02:51,016
I didn't think
that would happen to me.

1245
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:56,052
We didn't sign your brother.

1246
01:02:56,054 --> 01:02:57,520
And we shouldn't
have signed you.

1247
01:02:57,522 --> 01:02:58,721
You're weak in your body...

1248
01:02:58,723 --> 01:03:00,925
and your spirit's weak.

1249
01:03:00,927 --> 01:03:04,195
You think it's tough now.
This is only gonna get harder.

1250
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:07,064
You should go home.

1251
01:03:07,066 --> 01:03:09,903
Wrestle with your family
and be happy.

1252
01:03:11,038 --> 01:03:12,906
That's how this ends for ya.

1253
01:03:27,021 --> 01:03:30,924
It's gonna be
four grand up, love.

1254
01:03:30,926 --> 01:03:34,261
There's a big buzz about
the Christmassacre, you know.

1255
01:03:34,263 --> 01:03:35,596
I'm thinking
that I might have to do

1256
01:03:35,598 --> 01:03:38,736
maybe two nights, babe,
if you can hang around.

1257
01:03:46,643 --> 01:03:48,944
Bloody hell!
Look at that tan!

1258
01:03:48,946 --> 01:03:51,026
Willy Wonka called, he needs
you back at the factory.

1259
01:03:52,115 --> 01:03:53,616
Hi, Mum.

1260
01:03:53,618 --> 01:03:55,386
Come here, baby!

1261
01:03:57,924 --> 01:03:59,322
- Who made you do all that?
- Huh?

1262
01:03:59,324 --> 01:04:01,925
- All of that.
- No one.

1263
01:04:01,927 --> 01:04:04,931
- It's America, it's different.
- Right.

1264
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:07,598
Anyway, how's Caden?
How's Courtney?

1265
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,066
- Caden's beautiful, yeah.
- Yeah?

1266
01:04:09,068 --> 01:04:10,901
- Yeah.
- And how's Zak?

1267
01:04:10,903 --> 01:04:13,138
- Yeah, no, Zak's good.
- Yeah?

1268
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,808
- Yeah, he's good.
- Okay.

1269
01:04:33,028 --> 01:04:34,030
Hey!

1270
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:38,667
- Hey.
- Hey.

1271
01:04:38,669 --> 01:04:40,969
- You all right?
- How you doing?

1272
01:04:40,971 --> 01:04:42,737
Yeah, good, yeah, good.

1273
01:04:42,739 --> 01:04:44,472
How are you?

1274
01:04:44,474 --> 01:04:46,274
Yeah, well...

1275
01:04:46,276 --> 01:04:49,010
I tried calling you
loads of times, but...

1276
01:04:49,012 --> 01:04:52,213
Yeah, my phone's
probably been off. Caden...

1277
01:04:52,215 --> 01:04:53,448
Been working a ton.

1278
01:04:53,450 --> 01:04:54,819
Oh, okay.

1279
01:04:58,524 --> 01:05:00,058
How is the States?

1280
01:05:01,259 --> 01:05:03,326
Uh...

1281
01:05:03,328 --> 01:05:06,729
Yeah, I've been wanting
to talk to you

1282
01:05:06,731 --> 01:05:08,634
about that, actually.

1283
01:05:09,735 --> 01:05:11,637
Um...

1284
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:14,542
I'm not gonna go back.

1285
01:05:19,645 --> 01:05:22,314
It's harder than we ever
thought it would be.

1286
01:05:22,316 --> 01:05:24,353
And I... I can't do it.

1287
01:05:30,324 --> 01:05:31,557
I was hoping you could help me

1288
01:05:31,559 --> 01:05:34,063
tell Mum and Dad
about it later.

1289
01:05:36,664 --> 01:05:38,932
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
<i>- Ho, ho, ho!</i>

1290
01:05:38,934 --> 01:05:40,734
Thanks.

1291
01:05:40,736 --> 01:05:42,670
<i>Please welcome...</i>

1300
01:06:20,314 --> 01:06:22,716
- Yeah, Paige!
- We love you, Paige!

1301
01:06:32,461 --> 01:06:33,962
All right. Let's go.

1302
01:06:37,632 --> 01:06:38,930
Bit of back and forth.

1303
01:06:38,932 --> 01:06:40,100
You get the better of her.

1304
01:06:40,102 --> 01:06:41,669
Last minute,
you smash him up. Yeah?

1305
01:06:41,671 --> 01:06:44,437
- Good, let's go. Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

1306
01:06:44,439 --> 01:06:45,940
You ready? Ring the bell!

1307
01:06:45,942 --> 01:06:48,774
- Come on, baby girl!
- Come on, Paige!

1308
01:06:55,652 --> 01:06:57,288
Come on, girl!

1309
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:04,295
Yeah.

1310
01:07:09,534 --> 01:07:10,701
Zak, come on.

1311
01:07:10,703 --> 01:07:11,871
- Zak!
- Get out, Zak!

1312
01:07:17,977 --> 01:07:19,046
What's he doing?

1313
01:07:21,647 --> 01:07:22,682
What?

1314
01:07:24,651 --> 01:07:25,686
- Zak!
- Zak!

1315
01:07:29,656 --> 01:07:30,658
Hey!

1316
01:07:37,064 --> 01:07:38,263
Go easy, would you?

1317
01:07:38,265 --> 01:07:39,968
You're going too hard.

1318
01:07:41,202 --> 01:07:42,503
No, no, no! Zak, no! Don't!

1319
01:07:46,008 --> 01:07:48,176
- Ref, get involved!
- I'm warning ya!

1320
01:07:48,178 --> 01:07:49,858
- She's fine, she's fine!
- Ease up on her.

1321
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:52,513
Come on, Raya, get up!

1322
01:07:52,515 --> 01:07:53,848
Daddy, I don't know
what he's doing.

1323
01:07:53,850 --> 01:07:55,252
Big smile, Raya. Big smiles.

1324
01:07:56,887 --> 01:07:58,256
Yeah!

1325
01:08:02,025 --> 01:08:03,626
- One!
- Yes!

1326
01:08:03,628 --> 01:08:05,693
- Two!
- Three!

1327
01:08:05,695 --> 01:08:07,364
- No! Two!
- No, three!

1328
01:08:07,366 --> 01:08:09,765
- That was two.
- Get up, Paige!

1329
01:08:09,767 --> 01:08:11,667
- Zak, get off me!
- No, no, no!

1330
01:08:11,669 --> 01:08:12,935
Let me down, Zak!

1331
01:08:12,937 --> 01:08:14,169
- Don't you dare!
- No!

1332
01:08:14,171 --> 01:08:15,239
Zak! No!

1333
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:20,744
- One!
- Zak!

1334
01:08:20,746 --> 01:08:22,713
- Two!
- Let me up!

1335
01:08:22,715 --> 01:08:24,050
Three!

1336
01:08:31,191 --> 01:08:33,991
- Shut up!
- Raya, you all right?

1337
01:08:41,436 --> 01:08:42,536
What was that?

1338
01:08:43,737 --> 01:08:46,038
Slam me three times!
Is that a joke?

1339
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,873
- Zak?
- Oi, dickhead!

1340
01:08:47,875 --> 01:08:49,943
You could've broken her neck!

1341
01:08:49,945 --> 01:08:51,110
She was in the ring, too.

1342
01:08:51,112 --> 01:08:52,945
She's a big girl.
Give her shit.

1343
01:08:52,947 --> 01:08:55,150
She does what she's told!
She follows the script!

1344
01:08:55,152 --> 01:08:56,720
Does she?

1345
01:08:57,386 --> 01:08:59,085
Shut up, Zak.

1346
01:08:59,087 --> 01:09:00,588
Well, you wanted my help
telling them.

1347
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:01,955
- Let's tell 'em.
- No, shut up!

1348
01:09:01,957 --> 01:09:03,959
- What is going on?
- Nothing. It's fine.

1349
01:09:03,961 --> 01:09:05,426
Look, babe.

1350
01:09:05,428 --> 01:09:07,563
- You ain't pregnant, are ya?
- No, I'm not pregnant, Dad.

1351
01:09:07,565 --> 01:09:09,264
- I will hit the roof.
- No, I'm not pregnant!

1352
01:09:09,266 --> 01:09:10,668
- It's fine.
- She's quitting.

1353
01:09:12,136 --> 01:09:14,103
- What?
- You prick.

1354
01:09:14,105 --> 01:09:15,674
You're welcome.

1355
01:09:20,445 --> 01:09:21,479
Wait.

1356
01:09:22,982 --> 01:09:24,782
You what?

1357
01:09:24,784 --> 01:09:26,686
Raya, I'm confused.
Is he... Is he joking?

1358
01:09:28,655 --> 01:09:29,688
No, I can't do it.

1359
01:09:30,589 --> 01:09:31,855
Of course, you can do it.

1360
01:09:31,857 --> 01:09:34,793
No, I wake up...
I work out, I train...

1361
01:09:34,795 --> 01:09:37,995
I come home, I can't sleep.

1362
01:09:37,997 --> 01:09:39,597
And then we do it
all again the next day.

1363
01:09:41,167 --> 01:09:43,201
I'm really lonely
and I have no friends.

1364
01:09:43,203 --> 01:09:45,205
Yeah, life of a wrestler.
Get a cat!

1365
01:09:45,207 --> 01:09:48,174
No, Dad, I don't wanna be
4,000 miles away.

1366
01:09:48,176 --> 01:09:50,476
I wanna be here,
I wanna be with my family.

1367
01:09:50,478 --> 01:09:52,179
You're doing this
for your family!

1368
01:09:52,181 --> 01:09:53,412
Yeah, I thought
Zak would be there.

1369
01:09:53,414 --> 01:09:54,849
Well, he ain't there!

1370
01:09:54,851 --> 01:09:56,817
He bollocksed it up!
So did Roy!

1371
01:09:56,819 --> 01:09:58,452
I'm not letting you
bollocks it up and all!

1372
01:09:58,454 --> 01:09:59,886
I'm not going back!

1373
01:09:59,888 --> 01:10:01,189
You are going back
to the States,

1374
01:10:01,191 --> 01:10:02,690
if I have to
drag you there myself!

1375
01:10:02,692 --> 01:10:04,658
You're an alchie ex-con, Dad!
They're not gonna let you in!

1376
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:07,395
- Oi, you watch your mouth!
- You... Stay!

1377
01:10:07,397 --> 01:10:09,229
Raya.

1378
01:10:09,231 --> 01:10:10,799
Raya, wait. Come here.

1379
01:10:10,801 --> 01:10:12,567
I know it's hard, okay? I do.

1380
01:10:12,569 --> 01:10:15,204
But you cannot give this
opportunity up. It's massive.

1381
01:10:15,206 --> 01:10:17,472
You're gonna regret it.

1382
01:10:17,474 --> 01:10:19,574
And it's what you've
always wanted.

1383
01:10:19,576 --> 01:10:21,714
Yeah? Or is it
what you've always wanted?

1384
01:10:22,346 --> 01:10:23,513
What do you mean?

1385
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:25,181
Mum.

1386
01:10:25,183 --> 01:10:27,153
You named me
after your own ring name.

1387
01:10:35,761 --> 01:10:38,030
Go away.

1388
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:43,301
Ray, Courtney rang.

1389
01:10:43,303 --> 01:10:44,463
Your brother's not come home.

1390
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:02,289
If you don't wanna go back
to America,

1391
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:03,923
we're not gonna make you.

1392
01:11:03,925 --> 01:11:06,058
Shut up!

1393
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:08,295
Has everyone gone mad?

1394
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:10,464
If she gets on the main
roster, she is set for life.

1395
01:11:10,466 --> 01:11:12,901
- She is, or you are?
- All of us!

1396
01:11:12,903 --> 01:11:14,568
Jesus Christ!

1397
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:15,737
You want me to go back
to robbing banks

1398
01:11:15,739 --> 01:11:17,438
- to feed this family?
- What family?

1399
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,007
Our daughter's miserable,
one son's in prison,

1400
01:11:19,009 --> 01:11:20,143
the other one's hanging on
by a thread.

1401
01:11:20,145 --> 01:11:21,243
Zak is fine!

1402
01:11:21,245 --> 01:11:22,612
Would you get your thick head

1403
01:11:22,614 --> 01:11:24,746
out of your fat ass?
He's not fine!

1404
01:11:24,748 --> 01:11:26,415
We're out looking for Zak!

1405
01:11:26,417 --> 01:11:27,751
If you have to go back
to robbing banks

1406
01:11:27,753 --> 01:11:29,720
to feed this family, so be it.

1407
01:11:29,722 --> 01:11:32,125
'Cause at this rate, we ain't
gonna have one to feed.

1408
01:11:45,237 --> 01:11:46,772
Dad?

1409
01:11:46,774 --> 01:11:49,008
- What, babe?
- Dad, that's Zak's car.

1410
01:11:49,010 --> 01:11:50,779
That's his car, right there.

1411
01:11:57,218 --> 01:11:58,919
I ain't joking.
These builders...

1412
01:11:58,921 --> 01:12:01,789
they said they're gonna
take about a month.

1413
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:03,689
How long they been there?
Come on, how long?

1414
01:12:03,691 --> 01:12:05,459
Six, seven weeks.

1415
01:12:05,461 --> 01:12:08,128
Every week,
they boost the prices, though.

1416
01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:09,296
They need this,
they need that.

1417
01:12:09,298 --> 01:12:11,435
A little bit of extra dough
for this...

1418
01:12:12,035 --> 01:12:13,036
Hey!

1419
01:12:13,569 --> 01:12:14,638
Oi!

1420
01:12:15,705 --> 01:12:17,940
What're you doing, mate?

1421
01:12:17,942 --> 01:12:19,208
What?

1422
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:20,475
You just stuck your elbow out.

1423
01:12:20,477 --> 01:12:21,646
No, I didn't.

1424
01:12:22,579 --> 01:12:24,346
You calling me a liar?

1425
01:12:24,348 --> 01:12:25,818
No, I'm calling you a wanker.

1426
01:12:26,818 --> 01:12:27,986
I didn't hear that.

1427
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,689
Then you're a deaf wanker
as well.

1428
01:12:36,828 --> 01:12:37,996
Come on, then!

1429
01:12:42,969 --> 01:12:44,137
Let's get him!

1430
01:12:46,039 --> 01:12:48,038
Come on, then!

1431
01:12:54,415 --> 01:12:56,748
Come on! Come on, then!

1432
01:12:56,750 --> 01:12:57,885
Come on!

1433
01:12:58,486 --> 01:12:59,521
Come on!

1434
01:13:00,455 --> 01:13:01,619
Hey!

1435
01:13:01,621 --> 01:13:04,490
That is enough! Let's go.

1436
01:13:04,492 --> 01:13:06,226
It's done.

1437
01:13:06,228 --> 01:13:07,994
That's Ricky Knight.

1438
01:13:07,996 --> 01:13:09,229
Silly sod!

1439
01:13:09,231 --> 01:13:11,334
Yeah, that's enough.
It is enough!

1440
01:13:11,901 --> 01:13:13,000
Zak!

1441
01:13:13,002 --> 01:13:14,201
Mum, it's fine.
We've got it. It's fine.

1442
01:13:14,203 --> 01:13:15,336
Silly bugger,
what're you doing? Come here!

1443
01:13:15,338 --> 01:13:16,340
Where you going?

1444
01:13:17,073 --> 01:13:18,773
Zak!

1445
01:13:18,775 --> 01:13:20,215
Yeah, you're right.
He's fine.

1446
01:13:20,576 --> 01:13:22,276
Jules.

1447
01:13:22,278 --> 01:13:24,045
Oi, come here.

1448
01:13:24,047 --> 01:13:26,550
Can we just talk
for a second, please?

1449
01:13:27,752 --> 01:13:30,051
Zak, why won't you talk to me?

1450
01:13:30,053 --> 01:13:31,487
'Cause I can't even look
at you.

1451
01:13:31,489 --> 01:13:32,558
Why?

1452
01:13:33,625 --> 01:13:35,792
Why? Why?

1453
01:13:35,794 --> 01:13:37,527
Okay, do you actually know
what it's like, Raya,

1454
01:13:37,529 --> 01:13:39,128
to want one thing in life?

1455
01:13:39,130 --> 01:13:41,966
One dream that you think about
every single day...

1456
01:13:41,968 --> 01:13:43,967
you work for,
and you train for,

1457
01:13:43,969 --> 01:13:45,535
and you get
that close to it...

1458
01:13:45,537 --> 01:13:47,837
and then your own sister
takes it away from you.

1459
01:13:47,839 --> 01:13:49,205
And then it turns out

1460
01:13:49,207 --> 01:13:51,142
she doesn't even want it
in the first place.

1461
01:13:51,144 --> 01:13:52,580
That's why.

1462
01:13:54,415 --> 01:13:56,080
I didn't take your dream, Zak.

1463
01:13:56,082 --> 01:13:57,783
No, then why am I still here?

1464
01:13:57,785 --> 01:14:00,254
Because they didn't want you!

1465
01:14:02,289 --> 01:14:04,290
I'm sorry,
and it is so shitty,

1466
01:14:04,292 --> 01:14:05,791
but it is not my fault.

1467
01:14:05,793 --> 01:14:07,125
And it's not yours.

1468
01:14:07,127 --> 01:14:08,831
It is just how it is.

1469
01:14:09,596 --> 01:14:10,997
Right.

1470
01:14:10,999 --> 01:14:14,068
Yeah. So you can either
curl up into a ball and die...

1471
01:14:14,070 --> 01:14:17,171
or you can live with it
and move on...

1472
01:14:17,173 --> 01:14:19,940
and start seeing all
the things you've got here.

1473
01:14:19,942 --> 01:14:21,109
What have I got here?

1474
01:14:21,111 --> 01:14:23,981
A beautiful son,
a girlfriend that loves you.

1475
01:14:25,115 --> 01:14:27,515
All those kids at the gym.

1476
01:14:27,517 --> 01:14:30,852
Zak, you're teaching
a blind kid how to wrestle.

1477
01:14:30,854 --> 01:14:32,290
How is that even possible?

1478
01:14:33,724 --> 01:14:34,856
Just 'cause millions of people

1479
01:14:34,858 --> 01:14:36,025
aren't cheering
when you do it...

1480
01:14:36,027 --> 01:14:38,196
it doesn't mean
it's not important.

1481
01:14:46,104 --> 01:14:49,610
I didn't take your dream, Zak.
It was my dream, too.

1482
01:14:52,845 --> 01:14:54,714
Then why are you
throwing it away?

1483
01:15:16,804 --> 01:15:18,007
Hey.

1484
01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:25,482
Can I come in?

1485
01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:40,132
Your mum is right.

1486
01:15:41,231 --> 01:15:44,936
If you don't
wanna go back, don't.

1487
01:15:46,036 --> 01:15:47,371
You don't have to do anything

1488
01:15:47,373 --> 01:15:49,606
that me or Mum or anyone
want you to do...

1489
01:15:49,608 --> 01:15:51,744
unless you wanna do it.

1490
01:15:54,745 --> 01:15:57,981
You are
the spark in our lives...

1491
01:15:57,983 --> 01:15:59,953
no matter what you do
with yours.

1492
01:16:05,023 --> 01:16:06,427
Come here.

1493
01:16:10,898 --> 01:16:12,598
What have you done
with this hair?

1494
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:16,069
I don't know.

1495
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:18,239
It's like kissing an afghan.

1496
01:17:34,990 --> 01:17:37,325
Can I help you with something?

1497
01:17:37,327 --> 01:17:40,260
You didn't cut me
and I didn't quit.

1498
01:17:40,262 --> 01:17:41,863
I have a showcase
in six weeks.

1499
01:17:41,865 --> 01:17:43,165
I don't have time
for any drama.

1500
01:17:43,167 --> 01:17:44,232
I know.

1501
01:17:44,234 --> 01:17:45,501
Are you sure
you wanna be here?

1502
01:17:45,503 --> 01:17:47,402
Yes.

1503
01:17:47,404 --> 01:17:49,237
Then you better
prove it to me.

1504
01:17:49,239 --> 01:17:50,741
Yes, Coach.

1505
01:18:07,727 --> 01:18:08,859
Let's move!

1506
01:18:30,619 --> 01:18:31,720
One.

1507
01:18:32,554 --> 01:18:33,756
Two.

1508
01:18:39,129 --> 01:18:40,131
Can I join?

1509
01:18:48,138 --> 01:18:49,808
Come on!

1510
01:18:56,613 --> 01:19:00,118
Look at them, look at me, go,
land at the same time, go!

1511
01:19:01,787 --> 01:19:02,889
I'm sorry.

1512
01:19:04,957 --> 01:19:06,089
Come on,
you're not a wrestler.

1513
01:19:06,091 --> 01:19:07,456
Squeeze the horn and go home.

1514
01:19:07,458 --> 01:19:09,260
Come on, you came to Florida,
you got a nice tan...

1515
01:19:09,262 --> 01:19:10,760
now it's over. Squeeze it.

1516
01:19:10,762 --> 01:19:12,763
Squeeze it.

1517
01:19:12,765 --> 01:19:14,130
Don't you dare.

1518
01:19:14,132 --> 01:19:16,667
Squeeze his horn and I will
give you such a receipt.

1519
01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:17,837
Horn's right here.
Just one squeeze.

1520
01:19:17,839 --> 01:19:18,971
Don't you touch
his dirty horn.

1521
01:19:18,973 --> 01:19:20,939
Come on, Jeri,
let's go!

1522
01:19:20,941 --> 01:19:22,408
- You can squeeze it.
- You can do it!

1523
01:19:22,410 --> 01:19:24,243
- You got nothing in the tank.
- Come on, Jeri! You got it!

1524
01:19:24,245 --> 01:19:25,676
Take the horn.
Take the horn.

1525
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:27,413
Stop, take it!

1526
01:19:27,415 --> 01:19:28,917
Take it. Take it.

1527
01:19:31,652 --> 01:19:32,852
Come on! Bring it in!

1528
01:19:38,827 --> 01:19:39,992
Take my wrists.

1529
01:19:39,994 --> 01:19:41,462
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Like this?

1530
01:19:41,464 --> 01:19:43,263
This is your time.

1531
01:19:43,265 --> 01:19:44,965
Okay! Yeah.

1532
01:19:44,967 --> 01:19:46,434
You're not the girl
I paid for.

1533
01:19:46,436 --> 01:19:48,969
I know. The girl you paid for
is tied up in your basement.

1534
01:19:48,971 --> 01:19:51,438
- You suck!
- Yeah, but you swallow.

1535
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,840
Eat me!

1536
01:19:52,842 --> 01:19:54,442
No, thanks.
I'm trying to bulk up.

1537
01:19:56,647 --> 01:19:58,482
Them, me, go.

1538
01:19:59,284 --> 01:20:00,448
Whoa, Madison, hey.

1539
01:20:00,450 --> 01:20:01,617
All right, just lose
the suicide dive,

1540
01:20:01,619 --> 01:20:02,786
you're not gonna get it.

1541
01:20:02,788 --> 01:20:04,856
No, we will. I swear.
We'll get it.

1542
01:20:05,724 --> 01:20:07,093
You have to go for it.

1543
01:20:15,336 --> 01:20:17,567
Tag!
Let's go, in the ring.

1544
01:20:17,569 --> 01:20:18,769
You got it, Kirsten.

1545
01:20:20,174 --> 01:20:22,240
One...

1546
01:20:22,242 --> 01:20:24,075
- Two!
- Whoo!

1547
01:20:36,658 --> 01:20:38,928
- Tag me!
- Tag!

1548
01:20:42,897 --> 01:20:43,933
Yeah!

1549
01:20:52,775 --> 01:20:54,409
Come on, get out!

1550
01:20:59,416 --> 01:21:00,681
Come on! In the ring!

1551
01:21:00,683 --> 01:21:02,350
No, no, no!

1552
01:21:02,352 --> 01:21:03,422
Madison!

1553
01:21:13,632 --> 01:21:15,799
Unfortunately, we're
at that moment again.

1554
01:21:15,801 --> 01:21:17,604
Thank you for your time.

1555
01:21:20,806 --> 01:21:23,043
- Appreciate it.
- Thanks, Coach.

1556
01:21:23,977 --> 01:21:25,109
For the rest of you,

1557
01:21:25,111 --> 01:21:27,077
as a reward
for making it this far...

1558
01:21:27,079 --> 01:21:29,214
I'm gonna take you to
a quiet, romantic, little spot

1559
01:21:29,216 --> 01:21:30,448
I like to call <i>WrestleMania.</i>

1560
01:21:30,450 --> 01:21:31,717
What?

1561
01:21:31,719 --> 01:21:32,819
Yes!

1562
01:21:32,821 --> 01:21:34,086
Keep your focus.

1563
01:21:34,088 --> 01:21:35,488
There's still a lot of stuff
to do ahead of us.

1564
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:37,757
But we're gonna get to go out
and have some fun, okay?

1565
01:21:37,759 --> 01:21:40,595
Go home and get some
rest, guys. Thank you.

1566
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:48,768
All good?

1567
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:50,305
- All right?
- All right, love?

1568
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:56,079
- My big boy. Yeah.
- You all right?

1569
01:22:11,295 --> 01:22:12,429
Oh, my God.
That's Divas Champion.

1570
01:22:12,431 --> 01:22:14,866
That's Divas Champion.
Oh, my God!

1571
01:22:15,967 --> 01:22:17,135
No.

1572
01:22:21,041 --> 01:22:22,472
Hamburgers.
It's free food!

1573
01:22:22,474 --> 01:22:23,940
You know
I'm an emotional eater.

1574
01:22:23,942 --> 01:22:25,008
You're enabling me now.

1575
01:22:25,010 --> 01:22:26,276
This is gonna make me
gain weight.

1576
01:22:26,278 --> 01:22:27,345
You can burn it off
in the ring. That's great.

1577
01:22:27,347 --> 01:22:28,512
- I can't burn it off.
- Hi, guys.

1578
01:22:28,514 --> 01:22:29,682
Eat as much as you want.

1579
01:22:29,684 --> 01:22:30,848
- Hi.
- Hey.

1580
01:22:30,850 --> 01:22:32,217
I'm a massive fan.

1581
01:22:32,219 --> 01:22:33,451
- Cool.
- Thanks. Thanks.

1582
01:22:33,453 --> 01:22:34,454
Just gonna...

1583
01:22:35,288 --> 01:22:36,420
It's free, right? Yeah?

1584
01:22:36,422 --> 01:22:37,656
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's free.

1585
01:22:37,658 --> 01:22:38,858
Yeah.

1586
01:22:38,860 --> 01:22:40,326
You wanna leave some
for the rest of us there?

1587
01:22:40,328 --> 01:22:41,493
- Yeah.
- Come with me.

1588
01:22:41,495 --> 01:22:42,862
Have a good match, boys.

1589
01:22:42,864 --> 01:22:44,030
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

1590
01:22:44,032 --> 01:22:45,232
Bye.

1591
01:22:45,234 --> 01:22:46,331
If she can eat it,
you can eat it...

1592
01:22:46,333 --> 01:22:47,500
- Don't eat a hot dog.
- Here.

1593
01:22:47,502 --> 01:22:48,668
No, I don't...

1594
01:22:48,670 --> 01:22:49,910
Do you know
what's in a hot dog?

1595
01:22:53,543 --> 01:22:54,811
Is that The Miz?

1596
01:22:56,512 --> 01:22:58,212
Hey, Coach.

1597
01:22:58,214 --> 01:22:59,446
Where are you going?

1598
01:22:59,448 --> 01:23:01,716
I have no idea. I don't know.

1599
01:23:01,718 --> 01:23:03,318
- What's happening?
- Where is she going?

1600
01:23:05,988 --> 01:23:08,193
I'm sorry, I thought
the hot dogs were free.

1601
01:23:16,701 --> 01:23:18,067
Please.

1602
01:23:31,116 --> 01:23:32,516
<i>The following is</i>

1603
01:23:32,518 --> 01:23:37,189

Hey.

1608
01:23:46,535 --> 01:23:47,603
How're you doing?

1609
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:51,037
Yeah. Good. You?

1610
01:23:51,039 --> 01:23:52,405
Did you bring it?

1611
01:23:52,407 --> 01:23:55,942
Yeah.
Yeah, I brought it.

1612
01:23:55,944 --> 01:23:58,782
Paige, when's the last time
you spoke to your family?

1613
01:23:59,614 --> 01:24:01,147
Couple of weeks ago.

1614
01:24:01,149 --> 01:24:02,429
Well, I think
we should call 'em.

1615
01:24:03,953 --> 01:24:05,653
You wanna
call my family?

1616
01:24:05,655 --> 01:24:07,322
I would like to call
your family.

1617
01:24:07,324 --> 01:24:08,426
So what's their number?

1618
01:24:09,726 --> 01:24:11,292
Am I in trouble?

1619
01:24:11,294 --> 01:24:13,594
<i>The Black Widow is in.</i>

1620
01:24:13,596 --> 01:24:14,930
<i>Come on!</i>

1621
01:24:14,932 --> 01:24:17,132
<i>And she taps out!</i>

1622
01:24:17,134 --> 01:24:19,769
<i>Here's your winner, AJ Lee!</i>

1623
01:24:19,771 --> 01:24:21,336
Sit. Stay there.

<i>The longest of all time.</i>

1627
01:24:26,679 --> 01:24:29,048
Which prick is calling me
during <i>WrestleMania?</i>

1628
01:24:30,415 --> 01:24:33,550
It's, uh...
It's Dwayne Johnson.

1629
01:24:33,552 --> 01:24:35,620
Yeah,
and I'm Vin Diesel, mate.

1630
01:24:35,622 --> 01:24:37,355
Well, let's hope not.

1631
01:24:37,357 --> 01:24:38,623
No, it is, Mr. Knight,

1632
01:24:38,625 --> 01:24:39,905
it's Dwayne Johnson.
How are you?

1633
01:24:40,294 --> 01:24:41,295
Prove it.

1634
01:24:42,662 --> 01:24:43,831
Uh, okay.

1635
01:24:45,733 --> 01:24:48,533
If you smell...

1636
01:24:48,535 --> 01:24:50,036
<i>what The Rock...</i>

1637
01:24:50,038 --> 01:24:53,206
is cooking.

1638
01:24:53,208 --> 01:24:55,478
Yeah? Bullshit.

1639
01:24:57,945 --> 01:24:59,446
I'm sorry.

1640
01:25:02,351 --> 01:25:03,818
What?

1641
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:05,522
Dad! It's actually him.

1642
01:25:07,322 --> 01:25:09,690
- You what?
- Yeah, it's actually him.

1643
01:25:09,692 --> 01:25:11,428
Hold the line one second.

1644
01:25:13,162 --> 01:25:14,730
- It's Saraya and The Rock.
- Yeah, right.

1645
01:25:14,732 --> 01:25:17,165
I got you
on speakerphone, sir.

1646
01:25:17,167 --> 01:25:19,834
<i>Hey, yeah.
It's Dwayne Johnson.</i>

1647
01:25:19,836 --> 01:25:21,169
<i>I'm here
with your daughter now,</i>

1648
01:25:21,171 --> 01:25:23,505
<i>and, uh, I first met her
in London.</i>

1649
01:25:23,507 --> 01:25:24,874
<i>And I've been
keeping tabs on her...</i>

1650
01:25:24,876 --> 01:25:26,509
and I just heard some news

1651
01:25:26,511 --> 01:25:28,010
that I wanted
to share with her...

1652
01:25:28,012 --> 01:25:30,313
and I thought you guys should
hear it too at the same time.

1653
01:25:30,315 --> 01:25:31,948
- Right.
- What news?

1654
01:25:31,950 --> 01:25:35,087
Paige's time
with the NXT is over.

1655
01:25:35,887 --> 01:25:36,922
Oh.

1656
01:25:37,589 --> 01:25:39,022
- Oh.
- Okay.

1657
01:25:39,024 --> 01:25:40,657
Because tomorrow night...

1658
01:25:40,659 --> 01:25:43,027
she'll make her debut
live on <i>RAW</i>

1659
01:25:43,029 --> 01:25:46,834
and she will be fighting
AJ Lee for the Divas title.

1660
01:25:47,401 --> 01:25:48,436
Wait, what?

1661
01:25:52,072 --> 01:25:53,841
Dick me dead,
bury me pregnant.

1662
01:25:55,042 --> 01:25:56,342
There it is again.

1663
01:25:56,344 --> 01:25:58,409
You don't know what this means
to us, Mr. Rock.

1664
01:25:58,411 --> 01:25:59,678
Actually, uh...

1665
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:02,014
I know exactly what it means
to you, ma'am.

1666
01:26:02,016 --> 01:26:04,551
I myself have come from
a wrestling family, too...

1667
01:26:04,553 --> 01:26:05,919
<i>and I wanted
to share this news</i>

1668
01:26:05,921 --> 01:26:06,887
<i>with you guys
just so you could enjoy it...</i>

1669
01:26:06,889 --> 01:26:09,056
and also just so Paige can

1670
01:26:09,058 --> 01:26:12,360
prepare herself mentally to go
out there tomorrow night...

1671
01:26:12,362 --> 01:26:15,030
and win over the crowd.

1672
01:26:15,032 --> 01:26:16,330
Because
if you don't do that...

1673
01:26:16,332 --> 01:26:19,202
then they're gonna find
somebody else who will.

1674
01:26:19,204 --> 01:26:21,135
And then
this whole opportunity

1675
01:26:21,137 --> 01:26:23,140
will be gone by next week.

1676
01:26:29,248 --> 01:26:31,247
<i>She's not gonna
let you down, Mr. Rock.</i>

1677
01:26:31,249 --> 01:26:33,082
<i>I'll promise ya.
She's gonna smash it.</i>

1678
01:26:33,084 --> 01:26:35,118
<i>- She'll kill it.
- Proud of you, Ray.</i>

1679
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:37,753
<i>I love you, princess.
We're all with you, darling.</i>

1680
01:26:37,755 --> 01:26:39,323
You're amazing, baby.

1681
01:26:39,325 --> 01:26:41,092
I love you, Rock.

1682
01:26:41,094 --> 01:26:42,825
Rock?

1683
01:26:42,827 --> 01:26:44,230
I... I love you, too.

1684
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:51,639
It's The Rock! Huh?

1685
01:26:58,512 --> 01:27:00,947
Good luck tomorrow, Paige.

1686
01:27:00,949 --> 01:27:03,316
Yeah. Um, thanks
for picking me.

1687
01:27:03,318 --> 01:27:05,820
Nah, I didn't pick you,
I just work here.

1688
01:27:07,356 --> 01:27:08,922
You know him?

1689
01:27:08,924 --> 01:27:11,024
Yeah.
Yeah, I know that guy.

1690
01:27:11,026 --> 01:27:13,127
We once had a crazy match
where he threw himself...

1691
01:27:13,129 --> 01:27:14,694
off the top
of a 30-foot steel cage...

1692
01:27:14,696 --> 01:27:15,736
just to make me look good.

1693
01:27:17,366 --> 01:27:19,234
I'll see you later, Sex Tape.

1694
01:27:19,236 --> 01:27:20,802
Why'd you call him "Sex Tape"?

1695
01:27:20,804 --> 01:27:22,771
Oh, because he makes
people famous.

1696
01:27:22,773 --> 01:27:24,141
Good luck tomorrow.

1697
01:27:47,334 --> 01:27:49,033
Who'd a thought it, eh?

1698
01:27:49,035 --> 01:27:51,301
Our little sister's gone
from here...

1699
01:27:51,303 --> 01:27:52,839
to WWE.

1700
01:27:55,174 --> 01:27:56,374
You would've too, Roy,

1701
01:27:56,376 --> 01:27:57,842
if they'd given you
the chance.

1702
01:27:57,844 --> 01:27:59,444
No.

1703
01:27:59,446 --> 01:28:02,182
No, she has something
I never had.

1704
01:28:03,384 --> 01:28:04,486
What's that?

1705
01:28:04,986 --> 01:28:06,154
You.

1706
01:28:34,619 --> 01:28:35,687
Ez!

1707
01:28:37,388 --> 01:28:38,891
Get in the van, mate.

1708
01:28:42,727 --> 01:28:44,287
Come on, mate.
You're late for training.

1709
01:28:45,097 --> 01:28:46,564
Piss off, dickhead!

1710
01:28:46,566 --> 01:28:47,864
I would do, sweetheart,

1711
01:28:47,866 --> 01:28:49,132
but he's already paid
for the lessons.

1712
01:28:49,134 --> 01:28:51,403
And by Christ, he needs 'em.

1713
01:28:54,908 --> 01:28:56,273
Ez.

1714
01:28:56,275 --> 01:28:57,811
Please.

1715
01:28:59,979 --> 01:29:01,447
Ez.

1716
01:29:02,917 --> 01:29:04,553
Ez!

1717
01:29:11,124 --> 01:29:14,060
- All right?
- Yeah.

1718
01:29:14,062 --> 01:29:16,265
He looks lovely.

1719
01:29:18,299 --> 01:29:20,967
Smash it!

1720
01:29:20,969 --> 01:29:23,906
Out of the way!
I got a hammer on a pole!

1721
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:30,246
Come on! Oh, watch it!

1722
01:29:34,751 --> 01:29:37,453
- Zak's back!
- Get in the van! Come on!

1723
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:39,023
Leave that there!

1724
01:29:47,166 --> 01:29:48,664
Christ!
Please don't tell me

1725
01:29:48,666 --> 01:29:50,704
you're deaf as well, now!

1726
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,505
Strong into the ropes.
Strong.

1727
01:30:00,013 --> 01:30:01,212
That's it!

1728
01:30:01,214 --> 01:30:03,150
All right. Find the ropes.

1729
01:30:04,183 --> 01:30:07,019
Ez, let him know you're there.

1730
01:30:07,021 --> 01:30:09,320
All right, don't be scared.

1731
01:30:09,322 --> 01:30:10,591
Stand tall, mate.

1732
01:30:22,671 --> 01:30:25,008
Nice one! Well done!

1733
01:30:34,517 --> 01:30:36,317
<i>Born to raise hell</i>

1734
01:30:36,319 --> 01:30:37,751

1747
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:04,081
- Hang on a minute!
- This is it! Let's go!

1748
01:32:04,083 --> 01:32:05,763
Yeah, I know.
I said just hang on a second.

1749
01:32:06,486 --> 01:32:07,952
Hold on for what?

1750
01:32:07,954 --> 01:32:09,854
This is live TV!

1751
01:32:54,004 --> 01:32:55,404
<i>Well, you got a face
like a bulldog</i>

1752
01:32:55,406 --> 01:32:56,575
<i>licking piss off a thistle.</i>

1753
01:32:58,041 --> 01:32:59,878
Zak, I can't do this.

1754
01:33:00,879 --> 01:33:02,245
What're you talking about?

1755
01:33:02,247 --> 01:33:03,881
I'm gonna choke,
I'm gonna screw up.

1756
01:33:03,883 --> 01:33:05,850
I'm gonna botch a move. I...

1757
01:33:05,852 --> 01:33:07,584
I won't go over
with the crowd.

1758
01:33:07,586 --> 01:33:09,720
Paige!

1759
01:33:09,722 --> 01:33:12,190
Come on! Let's go!

1760
01:33:12,192 --> 01:33:15,328
Zak, I have no idea who
I'm supposed to be out there.

1761
01:33:17,198 --> 01:33:19,097
Do what The Rock said.
Be the first you.

1762
01:33:19,099 --> 01:33:21,733
Oh, bollocks to The Rock!

1763
01:33:21,735 --> 01:33:24,402
That's not advice, Zak,
that's a tweet!

1764
01:33:24,404 --> 01:33:27,041
He's not some weirdo freak
from Norwich, is he?

1765
01:33:27,943 --> 01:33:30,442
No, but that is who you are.

1766
01:33:30,444 --> 01:33:31,614
Who else you gonna be?

1767
01:33:33,514 --> 01:33:36,017
<i>Come on. If you can't
do this, no one can.</i>

1768
01:33:37,053 --> 01:33:39,118
You're a Knight.

1769
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:40,557
Wrestling's in your blood.

1770
01:33:43,026 --> 01:33:44,260
Like hepatitis?

1771
01:33:46,597 --> 01:33:48,128
A, B, and C.

1772
01:33:48,130 --> 01:33:50,268
<i>Riddled.</i>

1773
01:33:51,102 --> 01:33:52,968
And you got something else.

1774
01:33:52,970 --> 01:33:54,904
Something that I don't have.

1775
01:33:54,906 --> 01:33:56,871
Yeah? Like what?

1776
01:33:56,873 --> 01:33:58,906
That extra something.

1777
01:33:58,908 --> 01:34:01,111
Yeah, you don't know that.

1778
01:34:01,113 --> 01:34:04,147
<i>I've always known that.</i>

1779
01:34:04,149 --> 01:34:06,752
Why do you think I've been
acting like such a prick?

1780
01:34:08,153 --> 01:34:10,421
<i>And listen to me, right?</i>

1781
01:34:10,423 --> 01:34:12,823
No matter what happens
when you go out there...

1782
01:34:12,825 --> 01:34:15,993
it will never be as bad
as that time in King's Lynn...

1783
01:34:15,995 --> 01:34:18,194
when I went on
wearing Dad's shorts.

1784
01:34:18,196 --> 01:34:19,797
When your penis fell out!

1785
01:34:19,799 --> 01:34:21,199
When my penis fell out.

1786
01:34:21,201 --> 01:34:22,967
Everyone was laughing at it.

1787
01:34:22,969 --> 01:34:24,735
Everyone wasn't
laughing at it.

1788
01:34:24,737 --> 01:34:26,438
People were laughing
at the situation.

1789
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:28,574
Why did you even stay
in the ring?

1790
01:34:28,576 --> 01:34:29,975
Because I'm
a bloody professional.

1791
01:34:29,977 --> 01:34:31,844
And so are you, right?

1792
01:34:31,846 --> 01:34:34,180
<i>That's what I'm saying.</i>

1793
01:34:34,182 --> 01:34:36,848
So, have you got
your own shorts on tonight?

1794
01:34:36,850 --> 01:34:39,085
Yes. My penis won't fall out.

1795
01:34:39,087 --> 01:34:40,286
Then get out there.

1796
01:34:40,288 --> 01:34:41,991
<i>All right?</i>

1797
01:34:42,925 --> 01:34:44,260
Thank you.

1798
01:34:45,795 --> 01:34:48,328
It's what I'm here for.

1799
01:34:48,330 --> 01:34:50,497
<i>Now, go and win over
that crowd.</i>

1800
01:34:50,499 --> 01:34:52,267
<i>I wanna hear 'em
chanting your name.</i>

1801
01:34:52,269 --> 01:34:54,134
Okay.

1802
01:34:56,138 --> 01:34:57,441
Paige!

1803
01:35:00,311 --> 01:35:03,114
Come on, we're gonna be late.
Where were you? Jesus.

1804
01:35:05,816 --> 01:35:10,285
<i>The Divas Champion, AJ Lee!</i>

1805
01:35:10,287 --> 01:35:13,722
<i>Well, guys,
today marks day number 295...</i>

1806
01:35:13,724 --> 01:35:14,824
<i>in the historic</i>

1807
01:35:14,826 --> 01:35:17,328
<i>Divas Championship reign
of AJ!</i>

1808
01:35:17,330 --> 01:35:21,831
<i>Last night, she outlasted
13 other Divas...</i>

1809
01:35:21,833 --> 01:35:24,369
<i>to retain the title
at WrestleMania.</i>

1810
01:35:24,371 --> 01:35:27,238
<i>And, guys, I still
don't know how she did it.</i>

1811
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:29,843
<i>She keeps
finding ways to win.</i>

1812
01:35:31,712 --> 01:35:33,213
She on yet?

1813
01:35:35,082 --> 01:35:37,317
<i>For 295 days...</i>

1814
01:35:37,319 --> 01:35:40,987
<i>I have been
your Divas Champion!</i>

1815
01:35:43,557 --> 01:35:46,926
<i>The longest reigning
Divas Champion...</i>

1816
01:35:46,928 --> 01:35:49,266
<i>of all time!</i>

1817
01:36:01,444 --> 01:36:02,744
<i>Well, this right here is</i>

1818
01:36:02,746 --> 01:36:04,513
<i>a very
interesting development.</i>

1819
01:36:04,515 --> 01:36:05,748
<i>But that young lady...</i>

1820
01:36:06,951 --> 01:36:08,217
<i>...is Paige.</i>

1821
01:36:08,219 --> 01:36:10,419
- <i>She's from Norwitch, England.</i>
- Norwich!

1822
01:36:10,421 --> 01:36:13,089
<i>And she comes to us
from NXT.</i>

1823
01:36:13,091 --> 01:36:14,758
<i>Certainly different.</i>

1824
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:17,127
<i>And this is a huge
opportunity for Paige</i>

1825
01:36:17,129 --> 01:36:20,429
<i>to impress
this crowd here tonight.</i>

1826
01:36:20,431 --> 01:36:24,103
<i>AJ doesn't look
too happy to see Paige.</i>

1827
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:29,105
<i>A capacity crowd
in New Orleans...</i>

1828
01:36:29,107 --> 01:36:31,274
<i>millions watching
around the world...</i>

1829
01:36:31,276 --> 01:36:35,149
<i>under the bright lights
of</i> Monday Night RAW.

1830
01:36:44,458 --> 01:36:46,493
<i>I'm sorry,</i>

1831
01:36:46,495 --> 01:36:48,462
<i>is it Halloween already?</i>

1832
01:36:53,002 --> 01:36:56,139
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

1833
01:37:00,075 --> 01:37:01,241
<i>Well, you can understand
Paige being...</i>

1834
01:37:01,243 --> 01:37:02,577
She's frozen.

1835
01:37:02,579 --> 01:37:03,879
- <i>...a bit hesitant here.</i>
- Come on, darling.

1836
01:37:03,881 --> 01:37:06,482
<i>But these WWE fans
will turn on her quick.</i>

1837
01:37:06,484 --> 01:37:08,116
Do something!

1838
01:37:17,094 --> 01:37:18,828
<i>Tell you what.</i>

1839
01:37:18,830 --> 01:37:20,328
<i>Why don't I do to you
what I did</i>

1840
01:37:20,330 --> 01:37:23,167
<i>to every single Diva
last night?</i>

1841
01:37:26,339 --> 01:37:28,271
<i>I think we should have
a match right now.</i>

1842
01:37:28,273 --> 01:37:30,974
<i>And as a special
post-</i> WrestleMania <i>treat...</i>

1843
01:37:30,976 --> 01:37:34,345
<i>I will put my title
on the line.</i>

1844
01:37:42,524 --> 01:37:43,989
<i>Paige isn't ready.
I mean...</i>

1845
01:37:43,991 --> 01:37:45,558
<i>Paige came from a
wrestling family in England...</i>

1846
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:47,126
<i>but she... Oh!</i>

1847
01:37:47,128 --> 01:37:49,193
<i>She wasn't ready
for a match tonight.</i>

1848
01:37:49,195 --> 01:37:50,529
Come on, Ray. Get up.

1849
01:37:50,531 --> 01:37:51,664
<i>Paige needs to do
something here...</i>

1850
01:37:51,666 --> 01:37:53,634
<i>or she's gonna
let this opportunity</i>

1851
01:37:53,636 --> 01:37:55,405
<i>slip through her fingers.</i>

1852
01:37:58,339 --> 01:38:00,878
This is my house, freak!

1853
01:38:07,017 --> 01:38:08,285
- Yes!
- Come on!

1854
01:38:09,987 --> 01:38:11,089
Yes!

1855
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:23,601
Yeah!

1856
01:38:42,723 --> 01:38:45,059
Suck on that, bitch!

1857
01:38:46,058 --> 01:38:47,459
Mmm-hmm.

1858
01:38:47,461 --> 01:38:49,195
Sorry.

1859
01:38:49,197 --> 01:38:51,097
<i>And this could be
Paige's moment!</i>

1860
01:38:51,099 --> 01:38:53,432
<i>She's heading up
to the top rope right there!</i>

1861
01:38:53,434 --> 01:38:56,002
<i>AJ Lee has turned
this match around!</i>

1862
01:38:56,004 --> 01:38:57,236
<i>This doesn't end well.</i>

1863
01:38:57,238 --> 01:39:00,240
<i>Top rope,
AJ on the top rope.</i>

1864
01:39:00,242 --> 01:39:02,710
<i>AJ takin' out Paige!</i>

1865
01:39:02,712 --> 01:39:04,143
<i>Oh, man. Wow!</i>

1866
01:39:04,145 --> 01:39:06,446
<i>I don't think Paige knows
where she's at.</i>

1867
01:39:06,448 --> 01:39:07,983
<i>And now,
the Divas Champion</i>

1868
01:39:07,985 --> 01:39:10,751
<i>crawling toward Paige,
hooks the leg!</i>

1869
01:39:10,753 --> 01:39:13,054
- One! Two!
<i>- And it's over!</i>

1870
01:39:13,056 --> 01:39:15,259
<i>Oh, a kick-out!</i>

1871
01:39:16,126 --> 01:39:17,827
<i>Last moment kick-out by Paige!</i>

1872
01:39:17,829 --> 01:39:19,060
Hair!

1873
01:39:19,062 --> 01:39:21,333
<i>And this has just
angered AJ!</i>

1874
01:39:22,467 --> 01:39:24,936
<i>AJ with a kick
to the midsection.</i>

1875
01:39:27,505 --> 01:39:29,439
<i>It's the Black Widow!</i>

1876
01:39:29,441 --> 01:39:31,475
<i>The submission move...</i>

1877
01:39:31,477 --> 01:39:33,409
<i>that's taken out
so many Divas!</i>

1878
01:39:35,614 --> 01:39:37,249
<i>Paige is trying
to hang on here...</i>

1879
01:39:37,251 --> 01:39:38,650
<i>but she's gotta tap out!</i>

1880
01:39:38,652 --> 01:39:41,919
<i>She's gonna get seriously hurt
if she doesn't tap here!</i>

1881
01:39:41,921 --> 01:39:43,620
<i>Paige has gotta tap out!</i>

1882
01:39:54,535 --> 01:39:56,802
One! Two! Three!

1883
01:40:05,548 --> 01:40:07,847
<i>Now, the winner
of this match...</i>

1884
01:40:07,849 --> 01:40:12,919
<i>and new Divas Champion...</i>

1885
01:40:12,921 --> 01:40:16,359
<i>Paige!</i>

1886
01:40:21,197 --> 01:40:23,063
<i>This is unbelievable,
guys! You gotta watch...</i>

1887
01:40:23,065 --> 01:40:25,334
<i>what happens here
at the end of this thing!</i>

1888
01:40:25,336 --> 01:40:27,370
<i>Watch Paige
with a Paige Turner!</i>

1889
01:40:27,372 --> 01:40:30,005
That's the Zak Attack!
She stole your move!

1890
01:40:30,007 --> 01:40:32,141
She didn't steal it,
I gave it to her!

1891
01:40:41,421 --> 01:40:43,057
<i>I am a freak!</i>

1892
01:40:45,224 --> 01:40:48,760
<i>From Norwich, England!</i>

1893
01:40:48,762 --> 01:40:50,595
<i>And I have dreamt of this...</i>

1894
01:40:50,597 --> 01:40:54,165
<i>since I was 13 years old!</i>

1895
01:40:54,167 --> 01:40:56,938
<i>And it's not just mine,
it belongs to my family!</i>

1896
01:41:01,609 --> 01:41:03,242
<i>It belongs to anyone
who ever felt</i>

1897
01:41:03,244 --> 01:41:06,713
<i>like they are the freak
from Norwich...</i>

1898
01:41:06,715 --> 01:41:09,014
<i>the oddballs, the outsiders...</i>

1899
01:41:09,016 --> 01:41:11,117
<i>the ones that don't belong!</i>

1900
01:41:17,126 --> 01:41:20,127
<i>My name is Paige.</i>

1901
01:41:20,129 --> 01:41:22,598
<i>And this is my house now!</i>

1902
01:41:27,471 --> 01:41:30,643
- Yes!
- That's right! That's right!

1903
01:41:47,559 --> 01:41:50,829
Paige! Paige! Paige!

1904
01:41:50,831 --> 01:41:53,999
Paige! Paige! Paige!

1905
01:41:54,001 --> 01:41:56,800
Paige! Paige! Paige!

1906
01:41:56,802 --> 01:41:59,171
Paige! Paige! Paige!

1907
01:41:59,173 --> 01:42:02,340
<i>Paige! Paige! Paige!</i>

1908
01:42:02,342 --> 01:42:04,609
Paige! Paige! Paige!

1909
01:42:04,611 --> 01:42:06,645
Paige! Paige! Paige!

1910
01:42:06,647 --> 01:42:09,651
Paige! Paige! Paige!

1911
01:42:24,408 --> 01:42:26,877
- Look, the big man's crying!
- Sod off!

1912
01:42:26,879 --> 01:42:28,146
Look at him.

1913
01:42:28,148 --> 01:42:31,148
I'm not crying,
I'm allergic to the dog.

1914
01:42:34,554 --> 01:42:36,056
- Oh, my God!
- Go, Paige!

1915
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:41,727
Oh, my God!
That was incredible.

1916
01:42:41,729 --> 01:42:45,563
Oh, my God!
That was amazing!

1917
01:42:45,565 --> 01:42:48,702
- You were amazing. You did it!
- You were incredible!

1918
01:42:56,211 --> 01:42:58,115
<i>Yeah!</i>

1919
01:43:06,355 --> 01:43:08,956
<i>What an
incredible moment!</i>

1920
01:43:08,958 --> 01:43:11,392
<i>She wasn't even ready
to be in the WWE...</i>

1921
01:43:11,394 --> 01:43:13,861
<i>and Paige is gonna
leave here tonight...</i>

1922
01:43:13,863 --> 01:43:16,635
<i>the new Divas Champion!</i>

1923
01:44:10,818 --> 01:44:13,820
That youth title should be
around my waist, or trophy,

1924
01:44:13,822 --> 01:44:15,555
'cause I'm gonna
kick your ass!

1925
01:44:15,557 --> 01:44:18,093
And that's the bottom line,
'cause Zodiac don't care.

1926
01:44:20,428 --> 01:44:21,795
My first match,
I was knocked out

1927
01:44:21,797 --> 01:44:23,466
in about five minutes,
if that.

1928
01:44:25,902 --> 01:44:27,302
<i>I started growing up
watching it,</i>

1929
01:44:27,304 --> 01:44:30,771
<i>and I was just like,
"Ugh! It's really boring!"</i>

1930
01:44:30,773 --> 01:44:32,038
<i>Zak would get in the ring</i>

1931
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:33,542
<i>and throw me
about and stuff like that.</i>

1932
01:44:33,544 --> 01:44:36,078
<i>So, I always knew, like,
a couple of moves and stuff.</i>

1933
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:37,946
<i>Dad was short
on a show one day</i>

1934
01:44:37,948 --> 01:44:39,847
<i>when I was 13 years old.</i>

1935
01:44:41,085 --> 01:44:43,687
So, yeah, I had to fill in
for that one slot,

1936
01:44:43,689 --> 01:44:45,591
and I've been hooked
ever since.

1937
01:44:58,437 --> 01:45:00,470
I'd done eight years in prison
before I was 25.

1938
01:45:00,472 --> 01:45:02,440
- Mainly violence.
- Mainly violence.

1939
01:45:02,442 --> 01:45:04,176
She was a young lady
at the time,

1940
01:45:04,178 --> 01:45:05,543
was contemplating suicide...

1941
01:45:05,545 --> 01:45:06,845
was going nowhere in life.

1942
01:45:06,847 --> 01:45:08,547
<i>Some people find religion.</i>

1943
01:45:08,549 --> 01:45:10,850
<i>Well, me and Julie
found wrestling.</i>

1944
01:45:10,852 --> 01:45:13,719
<i>That, to me,
is proper salvation.</i>

1945
01:45:13,721 --> 01:45:15,421
What? What?

1946
01:45:15,423 --> 01:45:18,024
<i>We are a family of wrestlers.
We make no apologies for that.</i>

1947
01:45:18,026 --> 01:45:19,958
<i>This is what we do,
this is what we love.</i>

1948
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:21,227
This is our passion.

1949
01:45:21,229 --> 01:45:23,697
This is gonna be our legacy
when I pop me clogs.

1950
01:45:23,699 --> 01:45:25,001
This is what it's all about.

1951
01:45:29,471 --> 01:45:32,208
I love you. I love you.

1952
01:45:36,646 --> 01:45:39,517
The rowdy man
that's crying his eyes out.

1953
01:45:44,521 --> 01:45:46,588
<i>Paige Turner,
she did it!</i>

1954
01:45:46,590 --> 01:45:48,160
<i>Paige did it!</i>

1955
