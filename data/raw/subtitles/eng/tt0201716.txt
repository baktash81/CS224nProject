1
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:30,761
Mr. Sho, I presume?
I'm Naka. I'm a realtor.

2
00:01:35,193 --> 00:01:37,013
Shall we go?

3
00:01:41,047 --> 00:01:43,454
It's hot.

4
00:01:49,224 --> 00:01:51,192
Drink?

5
00:02:01,585 --> 00:02:03,569
It's three o'clock.

6
00:02:17,411 --> 00:02:20,262
How did you know that?

7
00:02:20,297 --> 00:02:22,891
My girl told me.

8
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:30,714
She died at three.
It was no way for a dame to go.

9
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,078
Some time back I met a drifter here. He greeted me
as a yakuza, saying "most honorable greetings".

10
00:02:44,088 --> 00:02:46,627
That's how it all started.

11
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:53,297
Kanto - it's bigger than you think.

12
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,255
It's rather funny.

13
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:04,365
Inflatable Sex Doll of the Wastelands

14
00:03:09,776 --> 00:03:14,414
Screenplay: Atsushi Yamatoya

15
00:03:45,985 --> 00:03:47,609

00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:53,026
Yuichi Minato
Shohei Yamamoto

17
00:03:53,061 --> 00:03:58,539
Miki Watari

Director: Atsushi Yamatoya

19
00:04:41,442 --> 00:04:44,932
Your hotel -
where are you staying?

20
00:04:47,268 --> 00:04:50,213
- How are you going to do it?
- I got a rod.

21
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:54,670
You don't go for a blade?

22
00:04:56,918 --> 00:05:00,711
- I need someone who's good...
- I ain't playin' games here.

23
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:04,008
I like you already.

24
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:34,556
Let's see what you can do.

25
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:38,365
More than three shots and
the deal's off.

26
00:05:39,832 --> 00:05:44,559
<i>What a lonely tree.
It looks like it's drinking blood.</i>

27
00:05:46,868 --> 00:05:50,085
There are five or six of them.

28
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,452
I recently saw a guy get it
in two shots.

29
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:58,054
I can't do it in three.
It'll take 13.

30
00:05:58,089 --> 00:05:59,803
This isn't a joke.

31
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,736
Stop! That's enough!

32
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,445
I always leave one in the chamber.

33
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:26,874
Hot damn!

34
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,857
The tree had such fine
young branches.

35
00:06:44,953 --> 00:06:47,350
Plant a new one.

36
00:06:49,256 --> 00:06:51,617
That one's dead.

37
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,255
There they are!

38
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:12,570
You picked an awful hot day
to go on a picnic, bub!

39
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:18,119
I doubt any of the local honeys will
take you in tonight, wimp!

40
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:26,628
What's with the sourpuss?
Who are you working for?

41
00:07:27,037 --> 00:07:32,220
He's just an acquaintance.
I haven't told him anything.

42
00:07:32,255 --> 00:07:35,913
Why the hell not?
Tell him everything!

43
00:07:35,948 --> 00:07:40,949
Don't be comin' to us with your
petty ante jobs.

44
00:07:41,912 --> 00:07:47,280
You got it? Get the hell off
the road! Piss off!

45
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:03,899
I want half up front.
The usual price.

46
00:08:03,934 --> 00:08:07,545
- I'm counting on you.
- Give me a match.

47
00:08:51,636 --> 00:08:57,204
<i>I heard you had quite a date.
I heard you invited a sourpuss.</i>

48
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,323
What do you want?

49
00:09:00,358 --> 00:09:05,015
<i>The skirt I found at your place
has somethin' she wants to say.</i>

50
00:09:05,972 --> 00:09:07,777
Is she alive?

51
00:09:07,812 --> 00:09:10,813
<i>Alive and kickin'!
Legs spread wide!</i>

52
00:09:10,848 --> 00:09:14,539
<i>Help me!
Get me out of here!</i>

53
00:09:14,574 --> 00:09:18,168
<i>I dunno if you want
to see her like this!</i>

54
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:25,937
<i>Come and get her,
if you got the nerve.</i>

55
00:09:25,972 --> 00:09:30,104
<i>Although at this point, I'm not sure
if you're gonna want her back.</i>

56
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:31,539
I'll be there.

57
00:09:31,574 --> 00:09:35,625
<i>I'll be at Kado's bar.
Tomorrow at three.</i>

58
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,610
<i>This will be just our little secret.</i>

59
00:09:40,173 --> 00:09:44,535
Tomorrow at three.
At Kado's.

60
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,779
<i>Lookin' forward to it.</i>

61
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,936
Listen.

62
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,967
It's the girl from my office.

63
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,852
Her name is Sae.

64
00:10:30,293 --> 00:10:33,569
It's been six months
since she disappeared.

65
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:39,512
Every once in a while they'll let me
hear her voice like that.

66
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:46,197
It was a minor misunderstanding
about a piece of real estate.

67
00:10:47,497 --> 00:10:49,691
Now it's come to this.

68
00:10:57,085 --> 00:10:59,550
I can't see a thing.

69
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,000
You can't see!

70
00:11:05,992 --> 00:11:09,504
Open your eyes!
The poor girl!

71
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:15,010
Sae is right there on the screen!

72
00:11:15,863 --> 00:11:18,760
I think it's just the rain.

73
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,391
God, they're treating
her like an animal!

74
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,449
They're all holding her down
and violating her!

75
00:11:34,488 --> 00:11:38,453
Look, there he is!
He's wearing a mask.

76
00:11:38,488 --> 00:11:41,732
He pins Sae down and strips
her naked.

77
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,664
You can make out the legs of a man
in a chair on the side.

78
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:50,603
He was shouting, "Make a show of it!
We plan to sell this!"

79
00:11:50,638 --> 00:11:53,137
"Stop!" I yelled.

80
00:11:53,172 --> 00:12:00,426
The cameraman replied, "Maybe you'd like it
if we should put you in the picture."

81
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:04,649
I couldn't believe my ears!
Sae was my broad! Mine!

82
00:12:04,684 --> 00:12:08,375
They were roughing her up and
having their way with her.

83
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,176
They filmed everything with
that little camera.

84
00:12:11,211 --> 00:12:14,869
I begged them to stop.
I said I'd do anything they asked.

85
00:12:14,904 --> 00:12:19,796
I told them they could have
the land.

86
00:12:19,831 --> 00:12:25,547
What do you think he told me?
What?! What do you think he said?!

87
00:12:27,544 --> 00:12:34,311
"Quit yer yammerin', bub.
We've already worked out...

88
00:12:34,346 --> 00:12:38,982
"the real estate problem with
the landlord."

89
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:43,304
That's what he said.

90
00:12:45,115 --> 00:12:52,640
Then, I knew that even if I came at him with all
I had, it wouldn't amount to a hill of beans.

91
00:12:53,327 --> 00:12:57,819
Sae, bite off your tongue! Stick it out
all the way and chomp down!

92
00:12:57,854 --> 00:13:02,840
Bite it and die!
Please die!

93
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:14,281
She tried to kill herself,
but they stopped her.

94
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:18,358
It went from bad to worse.

95
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:23,474
Still, she managed to stick
her tongue out.

96
00:13:23,484 --> 00:13:27,288
They gagged her with her own panties.

97
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:56,055
I must've watched the reel
a million times. The film is worn thin.

98
00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:00,318
But I haven't forgotten a single detail.

99
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:03,090
Somebody's here.

100
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:10,728
He's worried about his daughter.

101
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:26,231
Shut up!

102
00:14:31,991 --> 00:14:34,151
He's not...

103
00:14:34,186 --> 00:14:37,130
He's the girl's father.

104
00:14:37,165 --> 00:14:41,198
Why don't you just go and take care
of this matter yourself?

105
00:14:42,395 --> 00:14:45,695
- I can't.
- Why not?

106
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:51,386
It's no good...
I've never shot a gun in my life.

107
00:14:51,421 --> 00:14:56,290
What would I do, up against
three or four hardened criminals?

108
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,669
Then you were played for a chump.

109
00:15:02,584 --> 00:15:07,781
Yeah? Maybe so...

110
00:15:08,938 --> 00:15:16,508
I never really expected her to
make it out of that room alive.

111
00:15:24,729 --> 00:15:27,504
That's the end of the reel.

112
00:16:06,262 --> 00:16:07,705
Is he here?

113
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,813
<i>He just came.</i>

114
00:16:38,124 --> 00:16:43,378
If he has another seizure,
just call.

115
00:16:47,229 --> 00:16:50,157
- Please take care.
- Thank you.

116
00:17:00,614 --> 00:17:06,556
Where are you staying?
Or can't you say?

117
00:17:09,892 --> 00:17:12,917
- What is it with you...
- What's it to you, bub!

118
00:17:14,865 --> 00:17:17,626
You're angry?

119
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:21,212
Those bozos in the car work
for you, don't they?

120
00:17:21,247 --> 00:17:23,610
Yep, all four of them.

121
00:17:23,645 --> 00:17:27,228
Great, I'll take half up front.

122
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:29,666
Really?

123
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:52,041
The money won't do me much good
if I lose the fight.

124
00:17:53,492 --> 00:17:56,240
I'm sure you have nothing
to worry about.

125
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,716
Tomorrow at 3:30.

126
00:18:34,793 --> 00:18:37,200
It's a toy.

127
00:18:39,297 --> 00:18:44,919
He plays with it all day long.

128
00:18:49,533 --> 00:18:52,305
It even sings.

129
00:19:04,552 --> 00:19:10,758
Be here tomorrow at 3:30.
I'll get her back for you, guaranteed.

130
00:19:12,846 --> 00:19:15,888
That would make me very happy.

131
00:20:40,694 --> 00:20:42,783
Give a girl a light, mister?

132
00:20:42,818 --> 00:20:45,199
Strike it for me.

133
00:20:46,624 --> 00:20:49,498
Put that away.

134
00:20:49,533 --> 00:20:52,154
Tell that hood behind us not
to try anything funny.

135
00:20:52,189 --> 00:20:55,512
You've got a sweet voice.
I feel all tingly.

136
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:58,388
I can see him waiting
in the shadows.

137
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,944
I wonder what would happen if you
pointed your tits in his direction.

138
00:21:00,979 --> 00:21:04,273
- Give me my matches back.
- Buzz off, slut. - Thief!

139
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,475
- Do you see this?
- Yeah.

140
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:15,259
- Tell me about this picture.
- It's the face of a girl.

141
00:21:15,294 --> 00:21:21,209
She was blindfolded. With a black cloth.
It partly covered her ears.

142
00:21:21,244 --> 00:21:23,694
She had to count on her nose
to smell what was going on.

143
00:21:23,729 --> 00:21:26,009
Why do you have these matches?

144
00:21:26,044 --> 00:21:29,565
Because my customers all smoke.
It's a bar, knucklehead!

145
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,304
Why did you blindfold her?!

146
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:35,280
What are you, some kind of
a freak or something?

147
00:21:35,315 --> 00:21:37,138
Who's the freak?

148
00:21:37,173 --> 00:21:41,168
- I didn't blindfold her, she's just
blindfolded. - Get out of my face!

149
00:21:42,307 --> 00:21:47,705
Who were you calling?! Get away
from there! You son of a bitch!

150
00:21:47,714 --> 00:21:50,958
<i>Koh, I'm gonna kill you!
You're a dead man!</i>

151
00:23:04,965 --> 00:23:10,917
<i>You're dead, Koh! You hear me!
I'm gonna kill you!</i>

152
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,425
If you're going to kill me,
get on with it!

153
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:22,901
You can run, but you can't hide.

154
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,567
This is the end for you!

155
00:23:29,602 --> 00:23:32,523
What do you think I'm hiding?

156
00:24:44,772 --> 00:24:47,144
I can see to the core
of your heart.

157
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:50,497
- What color is it?
- An unhealthy color.

158
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:53,157
You're color blind.

159
00:25:05,138 --> 00:25:08,109
I'm tired of playing
hide-and-seek with you.

160
00:25:08,144 --> 00:25:14,142
I'm impressed you've stayed
hidden for so long.

161
00:25:14,678 --> 00:25:19,743
- What's your secret?
- You stink.

162
00:25:19,778 --> 00:25:26,086
Any time you get within 5 kilometers,
it smells so bad I can't eat.

163
00:25:31,272 --> 00:25:33,839
I don't have body odor.

164
00:25:33,874 --> 00:25:37,396
You stink like a fart.

165
00:25:37,431 --> 00:25:39,977
You're right.

166
00:25:40,751 --> 00:25:46,929
I let one rip and it flies 5 kilometers,
right up your sinuses.

167
00:25:46,964 --> 00:25:49,849
You should have seen your face.

168
00:25:50,718 --> 00:25:54,561
You lost control and soiled
your boxers.

169
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:57,591
You're disgusting.

170
00:25:59,448 --> 00:26:01,282
Whatever.

171
00:26:01,317 --> 00:26:04,334
I just wanted to tell you I've
had enough of hide-and-seek.

172
00:26:04,777 --> 00:26:06,943
I should come at 3:00?

173
00:26:06,978 --> 00:26:12,804
We found you there dead
shortly past 3:00.

174
00:26:18,357 --> 00:26:21,886
The kids will want a snack at 3:00.

175
00:26:21,921 --> 00:26:26,031
- BG will run into the toilet.
- The CEO will drink tea.

176
00:26:26,409 --> 00:26:29,305
<i>The pachinko parlor will open.</i>

177
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:34,719
<i>The girl will open the door.</i>

178
00:26:38,817 --> 00:26:41,304
We'll meet at 3:00.

179
00:26:43,388 --> 00:26:47,613
Only one of us will get out alive.

180
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:53,225
When it gets close to 3:00, the coils inside
of me will be ready to spring.

181
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,445
You sound like a robot.

182
00:26:56,136 --> 00:27:01,238
<i>I've lost track of how many
times I've killed you.</i>

183
00:27:02,916 --> 00:27:06,029
<i>For the last five years,
every day at 3:00.</i>

184
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:09,914
<i>It's like a dream that I can't
awaken from.</i>

185
00:27:43,506 --> 00:27:51,070
Tomorrow will be no dream...
unfortunately for you.

186
00:27:51,831 --> 00:27:54,910
- Koh.
- What?

187
00:27:54,945 --> 00:28:00,076
Do you remember her slender,
white fingers?

188
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:02,369
The ring was poor quality.

189
00:28:02,589 --> 00:28:05,614
I thought you were going to
give it to someone.

190
00:28:05,649 --> 00:28:08,285
<i>It isn't worth anything.</i>

191
00:28:23,561 --> 00:28:27,583
Then, I guess there's no reason
to carry it around anymore.

192
00:28:29,483 --> 00:28:31,513
<i>You wept, didn't you?</i>

193
00:28:31,907 --> 00:28:34,603
I warned you, if you're
gonna run, do it.

194
00:28:34,638 --> 00:28:40,557
Just like you do every time, run off whimpering,
with your tail between your legs.

195
00:28:40,592 --> 00:28:43,039
That's what I came to tell you.

196
00:28:46,067 --> 00:28:49,599
I came to tell you
I won't back down.

197
00:28:50,257 --> 00:28:52,977
Watch what you say.

198
00:28:53,012 --> 00:28:55,549
You're the one who needs
to be careful.

199
00:28:55,584 --> 00:28:59,118
I won't be alone like before.

200
00:28:59,153 --> 00:29:02,045
I'll have backup.

201
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,656
"Backup"...

202
00:29:09,691 --> 00:29:14,769
You mean the idiots who helped you abduct
an innocent girl and forced her to be in a peep show,

203
00:29:14,804 --> 00:29:18,652
so you could sell it for
a little money on the side?

204
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:22,328
You're a quick study.

205
00:29:23,187 --> 00:29:26,208
- Do you really want to do this?
- Enough!

206
00:29:26,686 --> 00:29:32,488
Fine, say "Hi" to your boys for me.

207
00:29:37,696 --> 00:29:41,351
Don't forget - tomorrow at 3:00.

208
00:30:23,095 --> 00:30:24,897
Cigarettes.

209
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:27,595
Here you go.

210
00:30:30,883 --> 00:30:32,916
Have a nice time.

211
00:30:32,951 --> 00:30:37,703
I get the picture;
you meant the fancy matches.

212
00:30:46,343 --> 00:30:47,926
Get out!

213
00:30:47,961 --> 00:30:51,950
Take me. You'll melt.

214
00:30:52,688 --> 00:30:55,909
Cheap broads are a dime a dozen.

215
00:30:55,944 --> 00:30:58,572
You think I'm stupid?
Get out, before I shoot you dead!

216
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,162
Just try it.

217
00:31:02,918 --> 00:31:07,030
The stink of your cheap perfume
is nauseating! Wash it off.

218
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:10,135
- It ain't cheap.
- This is no joke!

219
00:31:33,514 --> 00:31:38,048
You animal!

220
00:32:22,932 --> 00:32:25,805
You creep! You heel!

221
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:22,786
<i>Don't leave without oiling
your precious gun.</i>

222
00:33:24,156 --> 00:33:34,527
<i>What will I do if the gun
doesn't fire?</i>

223
00:33:36,263 --> 00:33:47,091
<i>I'll have to bring back
a different man every night.</i>

224
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:59,343
<i>That's why you have to
be careful not to forget.</i>

225
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:03,235
I won't forget a damn thing.

226
00:34:05,482 --> 00:34:08,843
You can't separate me
from my baby.

227
00:34:09,898 --> 00:34:11,994
It's cold.

228
00:34:13,244 --> 00:34:18,957
It's not cold when it's angry.
You'll get burned.

229
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:24,346
I love to let my baby howl
till it goes click.

230
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:31,460
The blast ripples out of the barrel
and the target goes blurry.

231
00:34:32,636 --> 00:34:35,049
You'll melt.

232
00:34:35,084 --> 00:34:37,652
It goes blurry...

233
00:34:39,056 --> 00:34:41,998
The image twists.

234
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:49,455
You can see the bullet fly out
of the gun. Like a snake.

235
00:34:51,654 --> 00:34:55,552
My hollow point shells burn
as red as blood.

236
00:34:55,728 --> 00:35:02,212
It bites on to their throat
and whips them around.

237
00:35:09,728 --> 00:35:13,979
Take me... Do it.

238
00:35:14,528 --> 00:35:17,328
I need leather gloves.

239
00:35:20,789 --> 00:35:26,858
The room's hot...
Isn't there an air conditioner?

240
00:35:27,231 --> 00:35:30,137
You know how to talk the talk.

241
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:33,846
Put an air conditioner on my gun...

242
00:35:34,983 --> 00:35:41,042
The cool air will quench its
thirst for blood. Dammit!

243
00:35:41,077 --> 00:35:45,535
It's the latest model Colt Python,
with all the bells and whistles.

244
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:48,354
An air conditioner, she says!

245
00:35:49,882 --> 00:35:53,527
- I feel tingly.
- Open up your eyes, slut!

246
00:35:53,562 --> 00:35:56,743
I can't believe you prefer
a gun to a woman!

247
00:35:56,778 --> 00:35:58,670
Stupid bitch!

248
00:37:57,924 --> 00:38:00,129
Who told you?

249
00:38:00,164 --> 00:38:04,616
That horrible voice...
I can't disobey.

250
00:38:06,412 --> 00:38:08,516
I'm Mina...

251
00:38:10,078 --> 00:38:12,978
- What's your name?
- Sho.

252
00:38:13,013 --> 00:38:19,980
Sho... None of this has happened.
It's too fantastic.

253
00:38:20,015 --> 00:38:22,116
You're Koh's girl.

254
00:38:22,517 --> 00:38:24,223
You're wrong.

255
00:38:24,258 --> 00:38:29,037
You can't lie to me.
He's a knife thrower.

256
00:38:30,228 --> 00:38:32,198
He was my friend...

257
00:38:33,404 --> 00:38:36,728
He killed my girl and escaped.

258
00:38:36,763 --> 00:38:39,573
I don't know anything about that!

259
00:38:47,812 --> 00:38:51,536
<i>That son of a bitch.
You've gone too far.</i>

260
00:39:12,871 --> 00:39:18,513
<i>Remember, Rie.. The searing
summer sun at the beach.</i>

261
00:39:23,479 --> 00:39:26,556
<i>You were so proud of your suntan...</i>

262
00:39:26,591 --> 00:39:29,609
<i>But your fingertips were
still lily white.</i>

263
00:39:32,035 --> 00:39:36,566
- It would probably suit you
perfectly. - What would?

264
00:39:37,431 --> 00:39:41,951
You, happily waiting for tomorrow
at three o' clock.

265
00:39:41,986 --> 00:39:45,882
- You lied.
- About what?

266
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:50,265
Koh never killed your girl.

267
00:39:52,797 --> 00:39:56,506
Then why do you think I've been
chasing him around all this time?

268
00:39:56,541 --> 00:40:01,578
I've been gunning for that dog
all over Japan!

269
00:40:02,782 --> 00:40:07,290
I'm sorry, I didn't know
anything about it.

270
00:40:07,325 --> 00:40:09,872
There's still time...

271
00:40:12,151 --> 00:40:19,813
Time to nab his girl in some city
and wait for him to come.

272
00:42:05,622 --> 00:42:07,346
No, don't!

273
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,809
I let you live.

274
00:42:16,174 --> 00:42:21,140
Touch it... Don't you see?

275
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,134
It makes me so horny.

276
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:28,409
Koh made you who you are.

277
00:42:29,266 --> 00:42:33,614
Kill me! He told you to kill me!

278
00:42:55,787 --> 00:42:58,929
<i>You look just like my Rie.</i>

279
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:03,347
<i>It felt just like
I had her back again.</i>

280
00:43:06,571 --> 00:43:10,793
<i>Of all the hare-brained things!
I can't believe it.</i>

281
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,074
Stop.

282
00:43:14,447 --> 00:43:16,769
It's a fairy tale.

283
00:43:19,965 --> 00:43:23,532
No, that can't be right.

284
00:43:28,514 --> 00:43:33,111
I just want to keep you warm.
That's all I wanted.

285
00:43:33,146 --> 00:43:35,795
You're as cold as ice.

286
00:43:36,258 --> 00:43:39,772
Who do you think gave
him the scar?

287
00:43:39,807 --> 00:43:42,957
The shot in the shoulder, too.

288
00:43:42,992 --> 00:43:45,071
You heel!

289
00:43:46,391 --> 00:43:48,315
You're cute!

290
00:44:10,763 --> 00:44:13,812
Run. There's still time.

291
00:44:14,169 --> 00:44:17,358
Can't you see this is a trap?

292
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:21,701
- That rat who hired you planned
everything. - I know Naka's a viper.

293
00:44:24,178 --> 00:44:27,045
You don't get it.

294
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,177
Who do you think I am?

295
00:44:32,174 --> 00:44:35,181
Koh's boys must be brimming
with anticipation,

296
00:44:35,216 --> 00:44:37,744
waiting for three o' clock
to roll around.

297
00:44:37,779 --> 00:44:40,621
That's what time we agreed
to meet tomorrow.

298
00:44:51,873 --> 00:44:55,534
Sho, Sho!

299
00:45:05,392 --> 00:45:07,604
Don't answer it!

300
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:10,306
Why, is it wired to explode?

301
00:45:12,591 --> 00:45:15,709
I wanna see who owns your ass.

302
00:46:22,789 --> 00:46:28,787
<i>People are just like ants crawling
around. It's all a crock.</i>

303
00:46:37,129 --> 00:46:41,922
<i>Sleep tight, young wench.
I won't wake you up.</i>

304
00:48:05,971 --> 00:48:07,919
<i>See you later.</i>

305
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:18,526
You dirty rat! Get down!

306
00:54:25,474 --> 00:54:27,230
I'll kill you!

307
00:55:01,878 --> 00:55:04,226
I thought I'd come in for a drink.

308
00:55:04,261 --> 00:55:07,265
What's the matter,
you lose your nerve?

309
00:55:13,138 --> 00:55:15,940
Looks like you're out of bullets.

310
00:55:18,812 --> 00:55:20,674
Kill him!

311
00:55:35,689 --> 00:55:37,719
Where's the girl?

312
00:55:40,641 --> 00:55:42,569
Let's go.

313
00:55:51,751 --> 00:55:56,924
- Kill me.
- Of course. Come here.

314
00:55:56,959 --> 00:56:00,187
But did you really think I'd
let you die quickly?

315
00:56:20,203 --> 00:56:22,328
- Sho here.
- <i>Listen...</i>

316
00:56:22,363 --> 00:56:25,912
I'm the exterminator and I got
a cockroach I'm just about to step on.

317
00:56:25,947 --> 00:56:30,175
<i>- Listen...</i> - What?
- <i>Listen...</i>

318
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:38,400
I told Koh I wanted a drink, but this
joint's a little rich for my blood.

319
00:56:38,435 --> 00:56:41,177
<i>- Listen...</i>
- Shut up!

320
00:56:41,212 --> 00:56:43,688
I'm coming to collect my money!

321
00:57:43,347 --> 00:57:45,498
Where's Sae?

322
00:57:47,809 --> 00:57:49,393
Where is she?

323
00:57:53,612 --> 00:57:56,862
<i>Kanto - it's bigger than you think.</i>

324
00:57:56,897 --> 00:57:58,150
Naka!

325
00:58:00,347 --> 00:58:01,791
Is that you!?

326
00:58:01,826 --> 00:58:09,279
<i>In the howling winter wind,
the nightingale cries,</i>

327
00:58:09,314 --> 00:58:15,899
<i>Taro Sakamoto of Tone River...</i>

328
00:58:16,557 --> 00:58:21,887
<i>Make a show of it!
We plan to sell this!</i>

329
00:58:21,922 --> 00:58:25,476
<i>If you try to kill yourself by biting off
your tongue, we'll gag you with your knickers.</i>

330
00:58:25,511 --> 00:58:30,068
<i>Good, turn over.
Just play along with it.</i>

331
01:00:31,956 --> 01:00:33,978
There's no doubt.

332
01:00:34,013 --> 01:00:35,804
<i>It's no good.</i>

333
01:00:36,555 --> 01:00:39,632
You owe me money,
she's just asleep.

334
01:00:39,667 --> 01:00:44,366
<i>No way, I have no stake in
your revenge.</i>

335
01:00:44,401 --> 01:00:48,394
<i>I don't care if you did kill
three or four men.</i>

336
01:00:48,429 --> 01:00:50,928
See for yourself how many I've killed!

337
01:00:51,675 --> 01:00:57,407
When I shoot someone with my
hollow point shells, they stay down!

338
01:00:59,868 --> 01:01:03,534
38-caliber.
Check out my handiwork.

339
01:01:03,569 --> 01:01:06,348
They tumbled like dominoes.

340
01:01:20,219 --> 01:01:25,440
Get up.
Wake up, baby.

341
01:01:25,769 --> 01:01:29,655
Get up. C'mon.

342
01:01:30,859 --> 01:01:36,358
Wake up, wake up.

343
01:01:48,602 --> 01:01:50,844
You're up early.

344
01:01:52,547 --> 01:01:56,560
- I just wanted a drink.
- Nothin' wrong with that.

345
01:01:56,595 --> 01:02:01,109
Later, I'll give you as much as you want.
For old times' sake.

346
01:02:02,357 --> 01:02:05,030
But first, help me carry her.

347
01:02:05,724 --> 01:02:08,453
Finish me off quickly.

348
01:02:08,488 --> 01:02:11,064
I told you not to expect
an easy death.

349
01:02:11,099 --> 01:02:14,847
I've been dreaming of this moment
for five long years.

350
01:02:23,287 --> 01:02:25,883
Like a flash of lighting.

351
01:02:26,436 --> 01:02:30,014
I'm going to savor ripping you
apart piece by piece.

352
01:02:32,038 --> 01:02:35,973
Pick her up. Do it!

353
01:03:17,445 --> 01:03:19,739
The moment of truth.

354
01:03:19,774 --> 01:03:22,993
Before you die, I'd like to see
you pay for your crimes.

355
01:03:23,028 --> 01:03:26,313
It could help restore her
father's sanity.

356
01:03:40,413 --> 01:03:42,747
Are you good for anything?

357
01:03:42,782 --> 01:03:45,396
- Killing.
- Anything else.

358
01:03:47,701 --> 01:03:51,369
I don't think she's gonna wake up.

359
01:03:51,404 --> 01:03:53,935
She's just sleeping.
What else could it be?

360
01:04:14,156 --> 01:04:15,523
Get up!

361
01:04:17,364 --> 01:04:21,227
Struggle -
I want to see you suffer!

362
01:04:21,659 --> 01:04:25,036
- Kill me!
- Of course.

363
01:04:27,004 --> 01:04:30,605
You're no angel yourself.

364
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:33,242
She's just asleep.

365
01:04:47,554 --> 01:04:50,379
Naka! Are you there?

366
01:04:50,414 --> 01:04:53,244
I'm just about to crush an insect,
in case you want to watch.

367
01:04:53,279 --> 01:04:55,612
- Hey.
- Who is it!?

368
01:05:55,308 --> 01:05:59,572
She's sleeping.
She's just asleep, isn't she?

369
01:06:09,401 --> 01:06:11,360
Wake her up.

370
01:06:17,145 --> 01:06:20,480
I want her to see the
moment of truth.

371
01:06:22,016 --> 01:06:26,122
That's it, just do that.

372
01:06:26,157 --> 01:06:29,477
That's how I like it, Koh.

373
01:06:32,207 --> 01:06:34,633
She's just like a robot.

374
01:06:59,695 --> 01:07:02,536
I'm getting bored.

375
01:07:02,571 --> 01:07:07,915
Get her breathing again.
Can't you even do that?

376
01:07:10,649 --> 01:07:14,691
- I can see right through to her heart.
- She's just unconscious.

377
01:07:14,726 --> 01:07:16,692
Her skin has lost its color.

378
01:07:31,811 --> 01:07:38,090
Wake up. Wake up.
Come on.

379
01:07:38,125 --> 01:07:44,500
Snap out of it! Wake up!

380
01:07:45,148 --> 01:07:51,228
Wake up. Wake up.
Come on.

381
01:07:51,263 --> 01:07:55,104
Snap out of it! Wake up!

382
01:08:25,074 --> 01:08:31,579
Naka, you still owe me half.
Don't forget it.

383
01:08:31,614 --> 01:08:40,651
<i>Don't leave without oiling
your precious gun...</i>

384
01:08:40,686 --> 01:08:43,929
<i>For a hitman, you turned out
to be a lousy shot.</i>

385
01:08:43,964 --> 01:08:46,728
<i>I heard you were such
a vicious killer.</i>

386
01:09:27,005 --> 01:09:30,100
You're a tough guy, ain't ya?

387
01:09:32,014 --> 01:09:34,838
Maybe it's about time to
finish you off.

388
01:09:42,721 --> 01:09:44,651
What time is it?

389
01:09:51,316 --> 01:09:54,729
I think there's a misunderstanding here.

390
01:09:55,629 --> 01:09:57,862
I'm gonna kill you.

391
01:10:00,269 --> 01:10:02,602
You should run, Sho.

392
01:10:03,226 --> 01:10:08,367
With your tail between your legs.
Get outta Dodge.

393
01:10:08,402 --> 01:10:10,691
Down to one bullet.

394
01:10:11,734 --> 01:10:14,423
Even lions die.

395
01:10:14,693 --> 01:10:18,143
38 caliber hollow point.

396
01:10:19,606 --> 01:10:21,454
Let's do it.

397
01:10:23,578 --> 01:10:25,999
Close your eyes.

398
01:10:26,607 --> 01:10:29,431
Say goodbye to this world.

399
01:12:46,367 --> 01:12:48,678
Get ready,
we're going on a trip.

400
01:13:07,207 --> 01:13:09,120
Wake up.

401
01:15:52,824 --> 01:15:56,708
What's the matter, Sho?
Did you lose your nerve?

402
01:15:58,101 --> 01:16:01,003
Looks like someone took the
bullets out of your gun.

403
01:16:06,733 --> 01:16:09,667
Did you think we would let
you die easily?

404
01:16:09,702 --> 01:16:11,701
You dirty...

405
01:16:11,736 --> 01:16:14,780
Struggle.
I want to see you suffer.

406
01:16:14,815 --> 01:16:18,661
- Kill me! Kill me!
- Of course.

407
01:16:41,823 --> 01:16:45,197
We're about to crush an insect.

408
01:16:45,702 --> 01:16:47,964
It's gonna be good.

409
01:16:54,865 --> 01:16:58,468
Right at the designated time.

410
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:13,630
Exactly three o' clock.

411
01:17:15,337 --> 01:17:21,831
It's me. I got a small scratch
on my nose.

412
01:17:27,792 --> 01:17:30,070
It's nothing.

413
01:17:30,105 --> 01:17:33,740
For a hitman, he turned out
to be a lousy shot, the louse.

414
01:17:33,775 --> 01:17:35,802
You may be right about that.

415
01:17:35,837 --> 01:17:38,588
He was probably dreaming.

416
01:17:40,736 --> 01:17:43,115
He just stopped moving.

417
01:17:44,470 --> 01:17:46,867
He's dead.

418
01:17:50,496 --> 01:17:52,535
Hand it over.

419
01:17:54,317 --> 01:17:56,275
Only one bullet left over...

420
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:59,834
I can't believe he only left
one bullet.

421
01:17:59,869 --> 01:18:03,897
He was ready to die along
with you in the gunfight.

422
01:18:03,932 --> 01:18:07,648
- You liked him better.
- You're both vermin!

423
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:11,285
You may as well be twins.

424
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:15,972
It makes me laugh - you act exactly the same,
you talk exactly the same!

425
01:18:20,334 --> 01:18:22,211
Stop laughing.

426
01:18:24,315 --> 01:18:29,742
- Die, coward! - Don't shout.
It's like salt in a wound.

427
01:18:33,794 --> 01:18:37,146
She double crossed us,
sell her off.

428
01:18:37,436 --> 01:18:40,662
Stop! Stop!

429
01:18:50,639 --> 01:18:54,942
You snake! You scum!

430
01:19:01,106 --> 01:19:04,833
Take care of her first,
and then clean up this mess.

431
01:19:05,369 --> 01:19:09,387
- I'll bury him under the tree.
- And also...

432
01:19:14,704 --> 01:19:20,084
It's cheap...
but it looks good on you.

433
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:22,572
Let's go.

434
01:20:09,447 --> 01:20:13,157
Most honorable greetings.
It's my honor to make your acquaintance.

435
01:20:13,192 --> 01:20:16,900
Let's skip the formalities.

436
01:20:16,935 --> 01:20:19,211
Shall we go?

437
01:20:24,265 --> 01:20:26,743
Your hotel - where are you staying?

438
01:20:26,778 --> 01:20:29,430
- I'd prefer not to say.
- No problem.

439
01:20:29,465 --> 01:20:33,968
I heard that a fella named Sho
had been seen in this area.

440
01:20:34,003 --> 01:20:36,703
Sho's dead.

441
01:20:39,358 --> 01:20:43,685
He was killed by a very skilful
knife thrower named Koh.

442
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:46,319
He died when he was sleeping
with a woman.

443
01:20:46,912 --> 01:20:53,308
Really? He was no chump.

444
01:20:53,343 --> 01:20:56,895
In any event, I'll need you.

445
01:20:58,637 --> 01:21:03,299
- Are you ready?
- Anytime you say.

446
01:21:55,347 --> 01:21:59,856
This town is famous for
its inflatable sex dolls.

447
01:22:00,406 --> 01:22:06,511
If Sho were alive, I'm sure he would
be very interested in them.

448
01:22:09,735 --> 01:22:11,836
Thank you, sir.

449
01:22:19,802 --> 01:22:24,482
The girl in room 2 seems to have caught
a cold. Could you have a look at her?

450
01:23:17,714 --> 01:23:21,331
<i>They come in droves
to have sex with them.</i>

451
01:23:21,366 --> 01:23:24,747
<i>It's the town's source
of tourist dollars.</i>

452
01:23:25,422 --> 01:23:30,001
<i>Once your job is done,
you should try it yourself.</i>

453
01:23:30,172 --> 01:23:34,574
- How do you want it?
- Three shots.

454
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:37,896
I'll do it in one.

455
01:23:37,931 --> 01:23:40,583
I like you already.

456
01:23:43,877 --> 01:23:45,939
Still...

457
01:23:54,894 --> 01:23:59,100
