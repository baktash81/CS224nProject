1
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,867
I'm so sorry. Can you help me?

2
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:49,869
My tire...

3
00:01:49,971 --> 00:01:53,134
Sorry. I have an appointment.
I don't like to be late.

4
00:01:53,241 --> 00:01:55,300
Well, would you rather
be late or dead?

5
00:01:56,611 --> 00:01:59,341
- You don't wanna do this.
- Step out of the car.

6
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:08,884
Whoo!

7
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:13,324
Let's go, fellas!
Come on, baby! Yeah!

8
00:02:13,428 --> 00:02:15,896
Take it easy. The car's brand-new.

9
00:02:15,997 --> 00:02:17,726
No problem, buddy. I got this.

10
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:21,269
- Baby, let's ride! Time to go!
- Let's get to the club, baby!

11
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,270
Your parents know the kind
of company you're keeping?

12
00:02:23,372 --> 00:02:25,840
- Shut up!
- Dog!

13
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:28,068
- This shit ain't workin', man!
- It's coded.

14
00:02:28,176 --> 00:02:30,201
- What's the code, man?
- I'm afraid I can't give you that.

15
00:02:30,312 --> 00:02:32,712
Well, I'm afraid we'll have to beat it
out of you. Let's get out of this car!

16
00:02:32,814 --> 00:02:34,782
Get out of the car, nigger!
Come on, man.

17
00:02:34,883 --> 00:02:37,852
- What you got for me, player?
What you got? - Kick your ass!

18
00:02:37,953 --> 00:02:40,251
- Come on, baby!
- Mm-hmm!

19
00:02:40,355 --> 00:02:42,516
Hold on.

20
00:02:42,624 --> 00:02:44,592
Just came out of the dry cleaners.

21
00:03:02,677 --> 00:03:06,704
Hands up!

22
00:03:07,983 --> 00:03:09,951
Stop moving, or I will shoot you!

23
00:03:10,051 --> 00:03:12,781
Don't you have homework to do?

24
00:03:14,856 --> 00:03:18,292
- Why don't you go and do it?
- Okay. I'm sorry.

25
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,464
Late.

26
00:04:33,301 --> 00:04:36,361
Hey, hey...

27
00:04:36,471 --> 00:04:38,340
The game! The game! The game!

28
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:41,340
What's the first rule
when entering a man's car?

29
00:04:41,443 --> 00:04:44,173
Respect a man's car,
a man respects you.

30
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:47,009
- Rule number two?
- Greet the man.

31
00:04:47,115 --> 00:04:49,811
- Good afternoon, Frank.
- Good afternoon, Jack.

32
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:51,184
Can we play the game now?

33
00:04:51,218 --> 00:04:53,684
I think your brain would be
tired after a day of school.

34
00:04:53,788 --> 00:04:55,517
You're just afraid I'm gonna win.

35
00:04:55,624 --> 00:04:57,649
I'm afraid you're gonna be too
worn out to do your homework.

36
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,250
It's Friday.
I don't have any homework.

37
00:05:00,362 --> 00:05:02,523
- In that case, the game.
- Yes!

38
00:05:02,631 --> 00:05:05,156
But first, what's the
third rule of the car?

39
00:05:06,701 --> 00:05:09,169
Good.

40
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:29,457
For five points. I'm white, I'm
round, but I'm not always around.

41
00:05:29,558 --> 00:05:32,425
- A tennis ball?
- Tennis balls are yellow.

42
00:05:46,007 --> 00:05:49,443
Four points. Sometimes I'm half.
Sometimes I'm whole.

43
00:05:49,544 --> 00:05:51,569
Sometimes a slice of me
is all you'll know.

44
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,978
- A loaf of bread?
- No.

45
00:05:59,387 --> 00:06:01,378
Three points.
Sometimes I'm light.

46
00:06:01,489 --> 00:06:03,389
Sometimes I'm dark.
Sometimes I'm both.

47
00:06:03,491 --> 00:06:05,459
- I know! A light bulb!
- No.

48
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,892
- A pizza!
- No.

49
00:07:08,657 --> 00:07:12,491
Audrey. Audrey!
Stop walking away from me.

50
00:07:12,594 --> 00:07:15,825
Listen, we've got to
finish this conversation.

51
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,830
- Just wait.
- I've got about two and a half...

52
00:07:17,932 --> 00:07:20,230
Where's he goin'?

53
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,698
Okay, look at me.

54
00:07:24,806 --> 00:07:28,674
Last clue for all the points.
Everyone wants to walk on me...

55
00:07:28,777 --> 00:07:31,007
but only a happy few ever have.

56
00:07:31,112 --> 00:07:33,171
Take your time.

57
00:07:41,156 --> 00:07:44,717
- Hey, bud. - Shh! Mom, it's
the game. I'm trying to think.

58
00:07:44,826 --> 00:07:47,056
Sorry. Hey, Frank.
How are you today?

59
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:50,393
- Well, Mrs. Billings.
- Frank, can I team up with Mom?

60
00:07:50,498 --> 00:07:53,194
- I don't know. It's not in the rules.
- Come on.

61
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:56,099
What's the point in having rules
if you can't bend 'em?

62
00:07:56,204 --> 00:07:58,104
Okay. Just this once.

63
00:07:58,206 --> 00:08:00,071
- Yeah!
- All right.

64
00:08:00,175 --> 00:08:02,075
Give me some clues.

65
00:08:02,177 --> 00:08:04,737
It's round,
but not always around.

66
00:08:04,846 --> 00:08:07,872
It's light sometimes. It's dark
sometimes. It's both sometimes.

67
00:08:07,982 --> 00:08:11,543
Everyone wants to walk on it,
but only a happy few ever have.

68
00:08:11,653 --> 00:08:13,951
Hmm. That is a hard one.

69
00:08:14,055 --> 00:08:16,216
Tell me about it.

70
00:08:17,926 --> 00:08:20,394
The moon!

71
00:08:20,495 --> 00:08:22,463
- Correct.
- Whoo!

72
00:08:22,564 --> 00:08:24,464
Good job. Good job.
All right. Come on.

73
00:08:24,566 --> 00:08:26,591
- See you Monday.
- Bye, Frank. Thanks.

74
00:08:26,701 --> 00:08:29,693
- Keep your snacks in the kitchen.
- Bye, Mom!

75
00:08:29,804 --> 00:08:32,898
Hey, he's really taken to you in
the month you've been with us.

76
00:08:33,007 --> 00:08:34,575
Likewise.

77
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,300
It's too bad you can't stay on
after Tony gets back.

78
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,360
It was just a favor.

79
00:08:38,413 --> 00:08:40,540
I don't usually do
this sort of a job.

80
00:08:40,648 --> 00:08:43,879
I thought you were
a professional driver?

81
00:08:43,985 --> 00:08:45,976
A different kind of driving.

82
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:51,315
Well, we're all gonna
miss you when you're gone.

83
00:08:59,234 --> 00:09:03,466
And... thank you
for what you did.

84
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:05,835
For what?

85
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,104
For turning the car around so that
Jack wouldn't have to see us fighting.

86
00:09:10,211 --> 00:09:14,147
- You really know kids, don't you?
- I know fighting.

87
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:17,946
He hasn't seen Jack in months.
And then when he gets back here...

88
00:09:18,052 --> 00:09:20,612
all I can hear
is what I'm doing wrong?

89
00:09:20,722 --> 00:09:22,690
You'd think that after
being separated for a year...

90
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,487
that he would...

91
00:09:25,593 --> 00:09:27,959
I'm sorry.

92
00:09:28,062 --> 00:09:32,021
- Um, you don't have to hear this.
- It's okay.

93
00:09:33,735 --> 00:09:36,260
For what it's worth, I think
you're doin' a great job with Jack.

94
00:09:36,371 --> 00:09:38,601
Thank you.

95
00:09:38,706 --> 00:09:41,539
Anytime I can be of help,
if there's anything you need...

96
00:09:41,643 --> 00:09:44,771
That's really sweet of you, Frank.

97
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:47,507
I might have to take you up on it.

98
00:09:49,717 --> 00:09:52,845
Oh, uh, I almost forgot.

99
00:09:52,954 --> 00:09:55,855
I'm supposed to take Jack to the doctor
tomorrow morning for his annual checkup...

100
00:09:55,957 --> 00:09:57,982
but I'm organizing
a surprise party for him...

101
00:09:58,092 --> 00:10:00,788
even though his birthday's
not until next week.

102
00:10:00,895 --> 00:10:04,353
I thought it would be nice
since his dad's in town.

103
00:10:04,465 --> 00:10:06,956
So while I decorate
and, um, his friends arrive...

104
00:10:07,068 --> 00:10:09,298
I was thinking
if you wouldn't mind...

105
00:10:09,404 --> 00:10:11,998
- I'll take him.  - I feel kind
of funny cutting into your weekend.

106
00:10:12,106 --> 00:10:14,973
I'm just picking up a friend
at the airport later on in the day.

107
00:10:15,076 --> 00:10:17,203
Oh. That's nice.

108
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:21,112
- What is?  - The guys on security
say you're a bit of a loner.

109
00:10:21,216 --> 00:10:24,014
Um, so it's just- it's just nice
to hear you have a friend.

110
00:10:24,118 --> 00:10:27,576
He's not really a friend.
He's French.

111
00:10:29,123 --> 00:10:31,990
I'll call you back.

112
00:10:32,093 --> 00:10:35,256
Audrey, I'd like
to finish our conversation.

113
00:10:40,468 --> 00:10:43,494
Well, if anything comes up between
now and then, you have my cell.

114
00:10:43,605 --> 00:10:45,573
Nothing will come up,
Mrs. Billings.

115
00:10:45,673 --> 00:10:49,370
- Audrey.
- Audrey.

116
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,473
- Yeah, hello?
- Confirmed for tomorrow, 9:00 a.m.

117
00:12:11,192 --> 00:12:13,160
Tomorrow, 9:00 a.m.
Only change...

118
00:12:13,261 --> 00:12:15,229
the driver will be taking him,
not the mother.

119
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,355
Even better.

120
00:12:21,436 --> 00:12:24,030
Vasily.

121
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:38,380
- Is it stable?
- Yes, it's stable.

122
00:12:38,486 --> 00:12:40,784
And the antidote?

123
00:12:47,562 --> 00:12:50,122
See you tomorrow, gentlemen.

124
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:03,834
And in other news,
the drug enforcement ministers...

125
00:13:03,945 --> 00:13:07,881
of six Latin American countries arrived
in Miami today for a summit meeting.

126
00:13:07,982 --> 00:13:11,418
Yeah. Martin, Frank.
1156 Palmetto.

127
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,817
I'm waiting
for an express delivery.

128
00:13:13,921 --> 00:13:15,980
That's what you told me
45 minutes ago.

129
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,650
No, I don't need anything else.

130
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,660
Just get me the pizza.

131
00:13:20,762 --> 00:13:23,424
- I'm not paying for that...
- Hi.

132
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:27,058
Hi.

133
00:13:27,168 --> 00:13:29,898
So, Mr. Martin, that's one
medium pie, no mozzarella...

134
00:13:30,004 --> 00:13:33,337
Extra olives and extra anchovies,
which amounts to 11.95.

135
00:13:33,441 --> 00:13:36,604
- I hope you're hungry.
- You have no idea.

136
00:13:36,711 --> 00:13:40,044
I apologize for the delay, sir.

137
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:43,674
Mrs. Billings.

138
00:13:43,785 --> 00:13:48,620
Uh-uh. Audrey. Audrey.

139
00:13:48,723 --> 00:13:50,657
What are you doin'?

140
00:13:50,758 --> 00:13:52,749
What does it look like I'm doing?

141
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,124
What, you've been drinking?

142
00:13:55,229 --> 00:13:57,129
A little.

143
00:13:58,966 --> 00:14:00,900
You said if I needed anything...

144
00:14:01,002 --> 00:14:03,436
I can't.

145
00:14:03,538 --> 00:14:06,268
Why? Because of who I am?

146
00:14:06,374 --> 00:14:08,865
Because of who I am.

147
00:14:19,687 --> 00:14:21,712
I feel so lost.

148
00:14:21,823 --> 00:14:23,586
So confused.

149
00:14:25,026 --> 00:14:26,994
Who isn't?

150
00:14:37,238 --> 00:14:39,763
Thank you, Frank...

151
00:14:39,874 --> 00:14:44,777
for the time and...
the respect.

152
00:14:46,447 --> 00:14:49,041
I think it's what
I needed the most.

153
00:14:51,252 --> 00:14:53,220
Bye.

154
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,689
- Am I gonna get a shot?
- I don't know.

155
00:15:51,312 --> 00:15:53,303
Geez! Um, we're not open yet.

156
00:15:53,414 --> 00:15:56,212
It's an emergency. I need to see
the doctor immediately.

157
00:15:56,317 --> 00:16:00,754
Right. Dr. Copeland, uh, if you'll come
out here, please. We have an issue.

158
00:16:00,855 --> 00:16:03,346
You'll have to fill out some papers
stating the medical problem.

159
00:16:03,457 --> 00:16:06,984
Actually,
my problem's not medical.

160
00:16:07,094 --> 00:16:09,528
- It's psychological.
- Yes, Laura?

161
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,599
- What seems to be the problem?
- Me.

162
00:16:13,801 --> 00:16:16,326
I hate shots.

163
00:16:16,437 --> 00:16:20,464
Number one: There's no guarantee
you're getting a shot.

164
00:16:20,575 --> 00:16:24,375
So there's no sense in getting all worked
up over something that might not happen.

165
00:16:30,551 --> 00:16:33,714
- Give me the good news.
- Doctor said I'm cured.

166
00:16:33,821 --> 00:16:36,346
Frank, it hurts a lot.

167
00:16:36,457 --> 00:16:39,119
- I'd never let anyone hurt you a lot.
- Promise?

168
00:16:39,227 --> 00:16:42,958
You know my fourth rule?
Never make a promise you can't keep.

169
00:16:43,064 --> 00:16:45,362
Come on.

170
00:16:47,435 --> 00:16:49,665
Close the door.

171
00:16:55,576 --> 00:16:58,477
Come on.

172
00:17:05,686 --> 00:17:08,883
- May I help you?
- Jack Billings to see Dr. Copeland.

173
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,823
I'm sorry. He's out sick today.
He'll be seeing Dr. Tyberg.

174
00:17:11,926 --> 00:17:16,090
- I like Dr. Copeland.
- Don't worry. Dr. Tyberg's very nice.

175
00:17:16,197 --> 00:17:18,495
Now, if you'll just
take him into room 3.

176
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,894
Where's Miss Laura?

177
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:21,935
- Who?
- You're standing at her desk.

178
00:17:22,036 --> 00:17:24,129
That Miss Laura.
She's out sick too.

179
00:17:24,238 --> 00:17:28,299
There's a lot of flu going around.
Now, come on. Doctor's got a busy day.

180
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:31,606
Come on. It'll be over
before you know it.

181
00:17:33,114 --> 00:17:35,776
Hey, hey!

182
00:17:35,883 --> 00:17:38,443
I'm Dr. Tyberg.

183
00:17:38,552 --> 00:17:40,144
Can't I wait for my doctor?

184
00:17:40,254 --> 00:17:43,985
Unfortunately, your doctor
was called away on emergency.

185
00:17:44,091 --> 00:17:47,185
- Your nurse said he had the flu.
- That was the emergency.

186
00:17:47,295 --> 00:17:49,525
He came down with flu very quickly.

187
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:52,997
So, the sooner we start,
the sooner we finish.

188
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,263
Eh? Come. I show you
something very cool.

189
00:17:58,105 --> 00:18:00,869
I'm sorry.
Doctor-patient privacy in room.

190
00:18:00,975 --> 00:18:04,706
But you can wait in reception area,
or glass of water, or...

191
00:18:04,812 --> 00:18:08,680
Hey, trust me.
I'm doctor.

192
00:18:08,783 --> 00:18:11,149
Oh, it's-it's phone.

193
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:16,481
- Yeah.
- Allo, allo.

194
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,490
Frank, I'm here.

195
00:18:18,592 --> 00:18:21,288
- You're early.
- Yeah. We had fantastic tailwinds.

196
00:18:21,395 --> 00:18:24,057
Two hours of my vacation
just like that.

197
00:18:24,165 --> 00:18:28,067
From now on, it's the only way
I fly, Frank. Tailwinds or nothing.

198
00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:29,830
Glad you made it.

199
00:18:32,406 --> 00:18:34,306
Hello?

200
00:18:34,408 --> 00:18:37,707
Sorry. Dr. Dunietz is not in today.
Call back Monday.

201
00:18:43,451 --> 00:18:45,351
Listen, Inspector,
I'm a little tied up.

202
00:18:45,453 --> 00:18:47,887
You mind taking a cab?
You have the address, yes?

203
00:18:47,988 --> 00:18:52,152
Thank you. You know, I heard
the fish down here is fantastic.

204
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:56,320
I could make us bouillabaisse.
You like bouillabaisse, Frank?

205
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,227
I gotta go.

206
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:01,667
Frank!

207
00:19:01,769 --> 00:19:03,737
You know, maybe it's better if we wait
for his regular doctor to come back.

208
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:06,830
It's very important that
he receives immunizations.

209
00:19:06,941 --> 00:19:09,239
Well, I'm sure it is. But a week
won't make a difference.

210
00:19:09,343 --> 00:19:11,607
No, we're doing...

211
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,630
Keep going, Jack!

212
00:20:44,872 --> 00:20:48,273
Look at me. Look at me.

213
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,435
- Remember my promise?
- Yes.

214
00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:14,227
- It's me!
- Get out!

215
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:20,703
Frank.

216
00:21:49,603 --> 00:21:51,503
Shit!

217
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:03,848
The patient's not cooperating.
Prep the vehicle.

218
00:22:16,997 --> 00:22:19,397
Come on! Hurry!

219
00:22:24,672 --> 00:22:27,368
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be okay.

220
00:22:54,068 --> 00:22:56,798
Freeze!
Drop your weapon!

221
00:22:56,904 --> 00:22:58,929
- Get down!
- Put your guns on the ground!

222
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,633
- Si.
- They got away.

223
00:23:01,742 --> 00:23:04,472
- God!
- Plan "B"?

224
00:23:04,578 --> 00:23:07,809
Yes, plan "B."

225
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,597
- Oh, you made it.
- Uh-huh.

226
00:23:29,703 --> 00:23:32,467
- Aw. What's that?
- Jack's birthday present.

227
00:23:32,573 --> 00:23:35,974
Baseball uniform,
cleats, glove and a bat.

228
00:23:36,076 --> 00:23:38,340
Whoo-hoo!

229
00:23:38,445 --> 00:23:42,279
- It's his favorite sport.
- It was last year.

230
00:23:42,383 --> 00:23:45,511
He's on a soccer team now,
and he's actually really good.

231
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:47,814
- You know, you should see him sometime.
- Hello?

232
00:23:49,123 --> 00:23:51,717
Mr. And Mrs. Billings,
they're coming!

233
00:23:51,825 --> 00:23:53,520
Hide, everyone! Hide!

234
00:24:01,235 --> 00:24:03,396
- Yes?
- Good morning, Mr. Driver.

235
00:24:03,504 --> 00:24:06,496
- Who is this? - Look in your rear-view
mirror, and you'll see who it is.

236
00:24:08,509 --> 00:24:11,171
I know what you're thinking.
Bulletproof glass.

237
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:13,143
So now you'll tell me,
in your experience...

238
00:24:13,247 --> 00:24:16,876
... which, judging from the little
performance you put on back at the office

239
00:24:16,984 --> 00:24:19,646
goes way beyond just driving
children to school and back...

240
00:24:19,753 --> 00:24:23,917
does bulletproof glass stop
a 7.62 armor-piercing round?

241
00:24:24,024 --> 00:24:27,084
Frank, why did you stop the car?

242
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,900
Don't bother moving.
I've triangulated 300 feet away.

243
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,326
Come on, Frank. Pick up.

244
00:24:34,368 --> 00:24:37,360
None of this would have been necessary
if you had not screwed up my plan.

245
00:24:37,471 --> 00:24:39,837
So, now I'm going to tell you
how to set things right.

246
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,067
Someone is going to appear
in a few seconds.

247
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:57,257
Let her in.

248
00:25:03,797 --> 00:25:07,062
Driver?

249
00:25:07,167 --> 00:25:08,896
Good boy. Good boy.

250
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:16,903
Hi.

251
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,069
Leave it on.

252
00:25:21,248 --> 00:25:23,773
Personally, I hate kids.

253
00:25:23,884 --> 00:25:26,079
Now, I don't know what
your feelings are on the subject...

254
00:25:26,186 --> 00:25:30,418
but if you ever wanna have any, make
no moves but the moves I tell you to make.

255
00:25:31,892 --> 00:25:33,757
You're in her hands now, amigo mio.

256
00:25:33,861 --> 00:25:36,796
They can be very gentle hands,
or they can be the hands from hell.

257
00:25:36,897 --> 00:25:41,732
- Trust me on this one.
- Trust him on this one. Now, drive!

258
00:26:24,578 --> 00:26:26,637
Make a left!

259
00:26:26,747 --> 00:26:29,215
I said left!

260
00:26:49,603 --> 00:26:51,503
Listen, we keep doing this
your way...

261
00:26:51,605 --> 00:26:53,800
no matter how many rights and lefts
we make, they're gonna catch us.

262
00:26:53,907 --> 00:26:56,808
- Let me do this my way so no one gets hurt.
- Where's the fun in that?

263
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:59,538
Let's save the fun for later.

264
00:27:07,354 --> 00:27:09,822
Hey! Look out!

265
00:28:52,025 --> 00:28:53,267
Not bad.

266
00:28:53,325 --> 00:28:55,351
Didn't your mother ever
teach you to say thank you?

267
00:28:55,395 --> 00:28:57,955
Yeah. She tried
and failed miserably.

268
00:28:58,065 --> 00:29:02,195
- I think we lost them.
- Think again.

269
00:29:06,707 --> 00:29:09,267
Thought complete. Let's go.

270
00:29:39,106 --> 00:29:41,074
What do you mean,
you can't find him?

271
00:29:41,174 --> 00:29:44,371
He's one man in one car!
He's a chauffeur, for Christ's sakes!

272
00:29:44,478 --> 00:29:47,675
Not exactly, sir. We think there's
a possibility he may have been in on it.

273
00:29:47,781 --> 00:29:50,750
- That's impossible.
- How would you know?

274
00:29:50,851 --> 00:29:53,185
He's been working here for a month.
He could've been setting this up...

275
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,654
the whole time and you wouldn't
have known any different.

276
00:29:55,756 --> 00:30:00,420
- You are such an expert on
knowing people! - His background.

277
00:30:00,527 --> 00:30:03,394
He's ex-special forces. Head of an
elite commando unit for five years...

278
00:30:03,497 --> 00:30:05,089
specialized in search and destroy.

279
00:30:05,198 --> 00:30:09,157
Been in and out of Lebanon,
Syria, Sudan. The man is a hunter.

280
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:11,931
I don't care what his skills are.
I don't care where he's from.

281
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:15,167
This is not a war zone!
This is an American city!

282
00:30:15,275 --> 00:30:17,505
Where's my son?

283
00:30:45,172 --> 00:30:48,073
Last stop. All out.

284
00:30:50,544 --> 00:30:52,512
You're quite a guy.

285
00:30:52,612 --> 00:30:54,944
Another time,
another place...

286
00:30:55,048 --> 00:30:58,950
you and me, baby,
the pleasure we could have.

287
00:31:04,858 --> 00:31:06,758
Beauty.

288
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,259
Frank.

289
00:31:10,263 --> 00:31:12,254
Frank!

290
00:31:13,567 --> 00:31:15,728
Frank!

291
00:31:15,836 --> 00:31:18,634
Not what you expected when
you reported for work this morning.

292
00:31:18,738 --> 00:31:20,638
Is it, Frank? No?

293
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,402
Is that what passes
for wit in this circle?

294
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,001
In this circle, my friend...

295
00:31:26,113 --> 00:31:28,308
wit is not a requirement of the job.

296
00:31:28,415 --> 00:31:30,007
Brutality, yes.

297
00:31:30,117 --> 00:31:32,517
An ability to inflict pain,
absolutely.

298
00:31:32,619 --> 00:31:37,852
A certain psychotic, moral ignorance,
blind obedience- all required.

299
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:40,449
But not wit.
How was it?

300
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,926
- Fun.
- Only the beginning, my love.

301
00:31:44,564 --> 00:31:46,464
What's this all about?

302
00:31:46,566 --> 00:31:48,830
A timely question. Max?

303
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:52,697
Pardon me.

304
00:31:58,945 --> 00:32:01,345
Hello?

305
00:32:01,448 --> 00:32:04,645
Put me on the speaker so you don't
have to repeat the instructions.

306
00:32:04,751 --> 00:32:08,778
In the next two hours, you'll get
$5 million in non-sequential $100 bills.

307
00:32:08,889 --> 00:32:10,516
You put them in
a waterproof suitcase.

308
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:13,058
You go to the
Bayfront Park personally.

309
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,287
There will be a blue Chrysler
parked on the sand.

310
00:32:15,395 --> 00:32:17,955
You place the suitcase
in the trunk, and you leave.

311
00:32:18,064 --> 00:32:20,658
I don't know if I can get
five million dollars in two hours.

312
00:32:20,767 --> 00:32:22,735
Mr. Billings, please.
I read the newspapers.

313
00:32:22,836 --> 00:32:24,804
The day you were appointed
to your current position...

314
00:32:24,905 --> 00:32:27,237
your net worth exceeded
100 million dollars.

315
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,035
So, you won't even feel the bite.

316
00:32:29,142 --> 00:32:32,578
What guarantee do I have
that you won't harm my son?

317
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:35,876
Guarantee, Mr. Billings? Huh?

318
00:32:35,982 --> 00:32:38,280
I'm not a car dealer.
Don't let the charming accent...

319
00:32:38,385 --> 00:32:41,115
and my grammatical,
impeccable syntax mislead you.

320
00:32:41,221 --> 00:32:43,416
I live in the jungle,
and in the jungle...

321
00:32:43,523 --> 00:32:45,423
you either eat or be eaten.

322
00:32:45,525 --> 00:32:48,050
But in the spirit of doing business,
here is the guarantee.

323
00:32:48,161 --> 00:32:51,858
Ten minutes past the deadline, if the
money doesn't arrive, I send a finger.

324
00:32:51,965 --> 00:32:55,765
Twenty minutes, a hand.
Thirty minutes, a foot.

325
00:32:55,869 --> 00:32:58,099
Sounds like we have a deal,
don't we, Mr. Billings?

326
00:32:58,205 --> 00:33:00,196
You have a deal.

327
00:33:02,409 --> 00:33:05,037
Could we please speak to our son?

328
00:33:06,446 --> 00:33:08,607
Mommy! Mommy!

329
00:33:08,715 --> 00:33:11,775
You have two hours, Mr. Billings...

330
00:33:11,885 --> 00:33:14,012
starting now.

331
00:33:15,956 --> 00:33:19,619
- Just get my son!
- All right. All right.

332
00:33:19,726 --> 00:33:23,457
Frank, you promised you
wouldn't let anybody hurt me!

333
00:33:23,563 --> 00:33:25,292
You promised!

334
00:33:25,398 --> 00:33:28,026
Never make promises
you can't keep, my friend.

335
00:33:28,134 --> 00:33:31,433
I don't.
It's one of my rules.

336
00:33:31,538 --> 00:33:34,666
Wow! Bravo!

337
00:33:34,774 --> 00:33:37,572
A man who lives his life
by the rules.

338
00:33:37,677 --> 00:33:41,135
- Well, in my world, rules are
meant to be broken. - Not in mine.

339
00:33:41,248 --> 00:33:45,048
This time, you're gonna
have to make an exception. Go.

340
00:34:13,046 --> 00:34:15,606
Prego.

341
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,154
- Go.
- Hey, driver!

342
00:34:32,799 --> 00:34:36,496
No, no. Wait, wait. A little distance
between us isn't a bad thing.

343
00:34:38,905 --> 00:34:41,169
Andiamo!

344
00:34:49,783 --> 00:34:52,183
Now.

345
00:35:26,486 --> 00:35:28,647
Hold on. No, hang on.
Wait for the signal.

346
00:35:28,755 --> 00:35:30,222
- Hello?
- It's me.

347
00:35:30,323 --> 00:35:32,883
- We've got something here, gentlemen.
- You son of a bitch!

348
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,687
Look, I had nothing
to do with this.

349
00:35:34,794 --> 00:35:36,694
One scratch on his head,
one hair out of place...

350
00:35:36,796 --> 00:35:38,423
Let me speak to who's in charge.

351
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,950
Hello, Frank?
This is U.S. Marshal Stappleton.

352
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,950
You have to act fast.

353
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,662
- There are three boats.
- Just tell us where you are.

354
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:46,398
Get a plane up over the Intracoastal.
They're heading north.

355
00:35:46,506 --> 00:35:49,066
- Just tell me where you are.
- Just tell us where you are!

356
00:35:49,175 --> 00:35:52,076
- Hello, Frank?
- Got it.

357
00:36:18,204 --> 00:36:22,573
Allo.

358
00:36:22,675 --> 00:36:24,370
Tarconi, it's me.
Get out of the house.

359
00:36:24,477 --> 00:36:26,877
No. I was just prepping
the madeleines, and...

360
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,777
Forget the madeleines.
Just get out.

361
00:36:28,882 --> 00:36:31,407
- And go where?
- Anywhere. The beach. Go to the beach.

362
00:36:31,518 --> 00:36:36,751
Oh, the beach. Oh, the famous
Miami Beach. Oh, my dream!

363
00:36:36,856 --> 00:36:39,256
I would love to go to the beach.

364
00:36:42,662 --> 00:36:45,256
- Maybe not.
- Freeze!

365
00:36:45,365 --> 00:36:48,095
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm the cook.

366
00:36:50,203 --> 00:36:53,604
Oh! It's a mistake!
A terrible mistake!

367
00:36:55,275 --> 00:36:59,302
Why we can't all just get along?

368
00:36:59,412 --> 00:37:01,312
You know?

369
00:37:16,129 --> 00:37:18,495
- Hello?
- It's Frank. Don't hang up.

370
00:37:18,598 --> 00:37:20,566
Pretend it's someone else.

371
00:37:21,634 --> 00:37:24,467
Hi, Susan.

372
00:37:24,571 --> 00:37:27,199
Uh, no, I'm just here at home.

373
00:37:27,307 --> 00:37:30,765
I didn't do it, Audrey. She had
a gun on Jack. I had no choice.

374
00:37:30,877 --> 00:37:34,176
Yeah, I saw that.

375
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,840
- What do you know?
- It's more than a kidnapping.

376
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,508
They called and asked for a ransom.

377
00:37:38,618 --> 00:37:41,178
The doctors there were fake.
They were trying to give Jack a shot...

378
00:37:41,287 --> 00:37:43,380
when I interrupted them.

379
00:37:46,659 --> 00:37:49,355
Audrey, I promised Jack
I wouldn't let anyone hurt him.

380
00:37:49,462 --> 00:37:52,454
- I'm not gonna break that promise.
- Frank?

381
00:37:52,565 --> 00:37:54,931
I'll call you back.

382
00:37:57,103 --> 00:37:59,333
Audrey?

383
00:37:59,439 --> 00:38:01,532
Is everything all right?

384
00:38:01,641 --> 00:38:04,542
That's a pretty stupid question to
ask right now, don't you think, Jeff?

385
00:38:12,185 --> 00:38:16,178
All right, so tell me again,
Inspector Tarconi...

386
00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:20,316
why you didn't immediately
identify yourself as a police officer.

387
00:38:22,228 --> 00:38:26,995
Oh. I was, uh, overwhelmed by the
effectiveness of your operation...

388
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,001
and the sophistication
of your equipment.

389
00:38:30,103 --> 00:38:33,334
You know, I work in a small
office in small town.

390
00:38:33,439 --> 00:38:35,873
We only have small crimes.

391
00:38:35,975 --> 00:38:37,875
I must admit,
I was a little insecure.

392
00:38:37,977 --> 00:38:39,877
And you and Frank Martin
are friends, right?

393
00:38:39,979 --> 00:38:43,710
A friend? Oh, I wouldn't say
exactly a friend.

394
00:38:43,816 --> 00:38:46,080
I know him.
We have a relationship.

395
00:38:46,185 --> 00:38:49,086
- A long relationship?
- Not so long.

396
00:38:49,188 --> 00:38:52,021
- But they found you cookin'
in his house! - I'm French!

397
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:53,752
- So?
- We don't need to know someone...

398
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,760
for a long time
in order to cook for them.

399
00:38:55,862 --> 00:38:59,298
It's our way of breaking the ice.
Take, for example, you.

400
00:38:59,399 --> 00:39:03,460
This sandwich and coffee.

401
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:06,437
You will pardon me to think so,
but it's not very good.

402
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:09,303
Yeah, I know. It sucks. But what
does that got to do with anything?

403
00:39:09,409 --> 00:39:12,640
Do you have a kitchen?

404
00:39:12,745 --> 00:39:14,872
Stay back. Stay back.

405
00:40:40,099 --> 00:40:42,090
Don't move!

406
00:40:42,201 --> 00:40:45,034
Smith! Drop it.

407
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,080
Fuck!

408
00:40:56,182 --> 00:40:58,582
Aah!

409
00:41:09,028 --> 00:41:11,656
I just found this.

410
00:41:11,764 --> 00:41:13,664
Oh, Jesus!

411
00:41:13,766 --> 00:41:15,825
- What happened?
- We'll take care of it for you.

412
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:26,708
- Are you sure this is safe?
- Look over your shoulder.

413
00:41:26,813 --> 00:41:29,247
We got you covered.

414
00:41:38,324 --> 00:41:40,417
As my mother used to say...

415
00:41:40,526 --> 00:41:45,225
- "A meal is only limited
by your imagination." - Hmm!

416
00:41:45,331 --> 00:41:46,923
That's créme brulée
and croque monsieur.

417
00:41:47,033 --> 00:41:48,625
- Cream brulée.
- Créme brulée.

418
00:41:48,735 --> 00:41:50,965
- Croque monsieur.
- Croque monsieur.

419
00:41:53,606 --> 00:41:55,403
- Oui?
- Where are you?

420
00:41:55,508 --> 00:41:59,035
- Cooking.
- Cooking? Can you talk?

421
00:41:59,145 --> 00:42:02,410
- Speak of the devil. My mother.
- Mom!

422
00:42:02,515 --> 00:42:07,418
Please, um, do you mind?
Thank you.

423
00:42:13,826 --> 00:42:16,056
May I ask who you're cooking for?

424
00:42:16,162 --> 00:42:17,891
For the U.S. Marshals.

425
00:42:17,997 --> 00:42:21,489
But once they found my badge,
they were very polite.

426
00:42:21,601 --> 00:42:23,796
They gave me coffee
and a sandwich.

427
00:42:23,903 --> 00:42:26,428
You wouldn't believe what passes
for food in this place, Frank.

428
00:42:26,539 --> 00:42:28,507
But I'm correcting the situation...

429
00:42:28,608 --> 00:42:32,203
while they wait for my chief
to call back and confirm everything.

430
00:42:32,311 --> 00:42:36,975
Of course, that might take a while.
He's never there.

431
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:40,678
- Anything about me? - Yes.
They are very interested about you.

432
00:42:40,787 --> 00:42:44,587
They want to know where you are.
Where are you?

433
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:47,022
Nowhere for very long.
Listen, hold on.

434
00:42:51,731 --> 00:42:54,495
Do you have access to a computer?

435
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,468
It's years since having access
to something decent.

436
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,486
Oh. Handsome fellow.
Who is he?

437
00:43:16,589 --> 00:43:18,784
That's what I need to know.
Do they have an I.D. Program?

438
00:43:18,891 --> 00:43:21,519
You'll forgive me,
but I'm not so used to this system.

439
00:43:21,627 --> 00:43:24,494
Back home, there is
one computer for 10 of us.

440
00:43:24,597 --> 00:43:26,963
So, how is it with you, Frank?

441
00:43:27,066 --> 00:43:29,034
It's a complicated story.

442
00:43:29,135 --> 00:43:32,036
- You mean, you are in the shit?
- You might say that.

443
00:43:32,138 --> 00:43:34,800
In other words,
you're not arrested.

444
00:43:34,907 --> 00:43:39,736
Ah! Voilà. A Russian biologist
with advanced degrees...

445
00:43:39,744 --> 00:43:43,240
from the state laboratory for
biological warfare in Siberia.

446
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:46,477
- Do we have an address?
- Miami. Park West.

447
00:43:46,586 --> 00:43:49,453
King Street, number 11.

448
00:45:30,256 --> 00:45:33,089
Get out!

449
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:52,673
Go! Go! Go!

450
00:46:00,252 --> 00:46:02,015
Hey!

451
00:46:05,257 --> 00:46:08,124
- What are you doing?
- Trying to catch a bus.

452
00:46:11,731 --> 00:46:14,393
Come on!

453
00:46:28,748 --> 00:46:32,650
What are you doing, driver?
Not so good on the water, huh?

454
00:46:55,975 --> 00:46:58,375
Hit the ground!

455
00:47:09,855 --> 00:47:12,688
- Okay. Okay.
- Tell me about the doctor's office.

456
00:47:12,792 --> 00:47:16,284
- What doctor's office? - The one where
you tried to stick the kid with this.

457
00:47:16,395 --> 00:47:19,592
Wanna tell me?

458
00:47:27,807 --> 00:47:31,538
Do you know what you have done?
Do you know what you have done?

459
00:47:31,644 --> 00:47:34,272
Obviously something not
conducive to your good health...

460
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,780
which is all I needed to know
in the first place.

461
00:47:36,882 --> 00:47:40,579
Have a good life.
What's left of it.

462
00:47:56,569 --> 00:47:59,299
Outpost to Base.
The ransom is still there.

463
00:47:59,405 --> 00:48:02,710
Thanks. The ransom still
hasn't been picked up.

464
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:03,750
What does that mean?

465
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,400
Don't worry.
Right now it means nothing.

466
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:06,708
What if it's not a kidnapping?

467
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:08,800
I've worked with over 15
kidnapping cases in two years.

468
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:11,840
You think that if they don't take
the ransom, I'm gonna get my son back?

469
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:14,850
Audrey, don't make this any more
complicated than it already is.

470
00:48:14,954 --> 00:48:18,981
I'm not making this complicated,
Jefferson. It's because of your job.

471
00:48:19,091 --> 00:48:20,956
What does my job
have to do with any of this?

472
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,960
It has everything to do with it.

473
00:48:23,062 --> 00:48:26,589
Don't you understand? Because you
became famous, we became the targets.

474
00:48:26,699 --> 00:48:28,599
And no matter what
any of you all think...

475
00:48:28,701 --> 00:48:31,829
the only one who's out there
trying to get Jack back is Frank.

476
00:48:31,937 --> 00:48:33,250
Frank? The chauffeur?

477
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:35,698
You spoke with Frank Martin
and didn't tell us about it?

478
00:48:35,738 --> 00:48:37,500
What the hell are you
doing talking to him?

479
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:39,740
Because he is the last
person who saw Jack alive!

480
00:48:39,778 --> 00:48:43,043
We found the boy.

481
00:49:07,606 --> 00:49:09,870
It shut down.

482
00:49:09,975 --> 00:49:11,840
- Hard drive blew.
- Get another one in there.

483
00:49:11,944 --> 00:49:14,606
- Yes, sir.
- How long is it gonna take?

484
00:49:14,713 --> 00:49:16,874
Ma'am, we're going
as fast as we can.

485
00:49:16,982 --> 00:49:19,109
- He can suffocate in there!
- Ma'am, stay calm.

486
00:49:19,218 --> 00:49:21,686
- It's my son!
- Audrey, let them work.

487
00:49:21,787 --> 00:49:23,507
Are you just gonna sit there
and do nothing?

488
00:49:23,517 --> 00:49:24,617
Audrey, they're experts!

489
00:49:24,657 --> 00:49:27,217
Everyone is an expert!
I've had it with all of you!

490
00:49:28,594 --> 00:49:29,993
Audrey!

491
00:49:33,432 --> 00:49:37,732
Audrey! Audrey!

492
00:49:41,974 --> 00:49:43,999
Audrey!

493
00:49:46,312 --> 00:49:49,304
Mommy! Mommy!

494
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:53,382
Jack!

495
00:49:53,485 --> 00:49:55,385
Are you okay?

496
00:50:00,793 --> 00:50:02,693
Here you go, little buddy.

497
00:50:07,566 --> 00:50:10,296
Breathe. Come on, breathe.

498
00:50:10,402 --> 00:50:12,962
You're the devil.

499
00:50:13,072 --> 00:50:15,063
I wish.

500
00:50:50,609 --> 00:50:54,238
- Tipov! No!
- Shit! Shit!

501
00:50:54,346 --> 00:50:56,780
Dimitri, you scared
shit in me!

502
00:50:56,882 --> 00:50:58,816
- Where is Sonavitch?
- He's in chamber.

503
00:50:58,917 --> 00:51:00,942
- I need to speak with him.
- He won't be long.

504
00:51:01,053 --> 00:51:03,749
Sit down!
Listen Panasonic.

505
00:51:03,856 --> 00:51:06,518
It's rock music. It's good.

506
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:46,558
- What was that?
- I don't know.

507
00:52:46,558 --> 00:52:47,024
- What was that?
- I don't know.

508
00:52:47,126 --> 00:52:48,787
Shit!

509
00:52:50,062 --> 00:52:52,223
- What are you doing here?
- I need antidote.

510
00:52:52,331 --> 00:52:55,425
The driver- He inject me
with virus. Look.

511
00:52:55,534 --> 00:52:57,627
Dimitri, where would he
get the virus?

512
00:52:57,736 --> 00:52:59,897
The one we left
in doctor's surgery.

513
00:53:00,005 --> 00:53:02,974
Please, I need antidote.
I am sick.

514
00:53:03,075 --> 00:53:07,239
Calm down. You're not sick. You have
four hours before the virus is active.

515
00:53:07,346 --> 00:53:09,644
You know that.
You worked on creating it.

516
00:53:10,883 --> 00:53:12,612
- Open fridge.
- I'm telling you...

517
00:53:12,718 --> 00:53:14,242
Open fridge!

518
00:53:14,353 --> 00:53:17,151
Open fridge.

519
00:53:17,256 --> 00:53:19,315
Open the fridge!

520
00:53:19,425 --> 00:53:23,725
Please. Insurance policy.
How many do you have?

521
00:53:23,829 --> 00:53:26,730
Two doses. Enough
for Tipov and myself.

522
00:53:30,269 --> 00:53:33,170
Tipov's policy canceled.
There is one for me.

523
00:53:34,373 --> 00:53:37,638
And I want it now.
Come on! Come on!

524
00:53:38,844 --> 00:53:41,244
Let's do it!

525
00:53:41,346 --> 00:53:43,644
- Let's not.
- Who are you?

526
00:53:43,749 --> 00:53:45,979
- Driver, there is enough for two of us.
- You don't need it.

527
00:53:46,084 --> 00:53:48,143
- But you injected me!
- With water.

528
00:53:48,253 --> 00:53:50,153
I'm not sick?

529
00:53:50,255 --> 00:53:52,189
- Not sick.
- Water?

530
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:55,089
Water.

531
00:53:55,194 --> 00:53:57,788
Son of bitch!

532
00:53:59,798 --> 00:54:03,199
Good. The problem is solved.
One dose for each of us.

533
00:54:03,302 --> 00:54:06,601
- It's not for us.
- Ah, one for you: One for the child.

534
00:54:06,705 --> 00:54:10,471
- Your devotion is touching.
- My patience is about to run out.

535
00:54:14,713 --> 00:54:17,705
- Tell me about the virus.
- Okay.

536
00:54:17,816 --> 00:54:20,944
- What do you want to know?
- Everything. For starters, what is it?

537
00:54:21,053 --> 00:54:24,614
It's a recombinant retro-immune
double-polymorphing efferent.

538
00:54:24,723 --> 00:54:27,624
The child will die.
Anyone he breathes on will die.

539
00:54:27,726 --> 00:54:29,557
- And then it's over.
- What do you mean, it's over?

540
00:54:29,661 --> 00:54:33,188
The virus is designed
to go inert after 24 hours.

541
00:54:33,298 --> 00:54:36,529
Thanks for the lesson.
Now give me the vials.

542
00:54:36,635 --> 00:54:39,729
You really want to play
superhero, don't you?

543
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:43,035
Well, let's see if you can fly.

544
00:55:19,244 --> 00:55:22,907
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

545
00:56:25,911 --> 00:56:27,811
There's nothing to worry about.

546
00:56:27,913 --> 00:56:29,763
It's just a simple viral infection

547
00:56:29,783 --> 00:56:31,783
combined with the stress
of what happened.

548
00:56:31,883 --> 00:56:33,809
It should pass in a day or two.

549
00:56:33,883 --> 00:56:34,909
I gave him something
to help him sleep.

550
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:37,921
Call me if anything arises.

551
00:56:38,023 --> 00:56:40,116
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Doctor.

552
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:45,656
You know, Audrey,
all of this has...

553
00:56:45,764 --> 00:56:49,359
Well, it's made me realize
what a fool I've been...

554
00:56:49,468 --> 00:56:53,336
with Jack... and with you.

555
00:56:55,073 --> 00:56:58,770
Are you okay?

556
00:56:58,877 --> 00:57:01,141
Mr. Billings, we're running late.

557
00:57:01,246 --> 00:57:04,306
I'll be right out.

558
00:57:04,416 --> 00:57:07,544
I'd like to come by
after the conference.

559
00:57:07,653 --> 00:57:12,022
Check on Jack.
Check on you.

560
00:57:15,093 --> 00:57:18,688
Good. I'll see you soon.

561
00:57:18,797 --> 00:57:21,061
They're here if you need them.

562
00:57:33,111 --> 00:57:36,638
- You all right, ma'am?
- I'm fine.

563
00:57:39,885 --> 00:57:42,979
- Hello?
- It's me.

564
00:57:43,088 --> 00:57:45,318
- Are you okay, Mrs. Billings?
- Go to your bedroom.

565
00:57:45,424 --> 00:57:48,359
Hi, Susan.
How are you?

566
00:57:50,162 --> 00:57:53,188
I'm alone.
Where are you, Frank?

567
00:57:53,298 --> 00:57:55,323
Turn around.

568
00:58:04,609 --> 00:58:07,203
Frank, you were wrong.

569
00:58:07,312 --> 00:58:09,712
It was a kidnapping.
Jack is fine.

570
00:58:09,815 --> 00:58:11,908
Jack's been infected
with a deadly virus, Audrey.

571
00:58:12,017 --> 00:58:14,747
Now anyone who comes into
contact with him will die.

572
00:58:14,853 --> 00:58:17,879
What are you telling me?

573
00:58:17,989 --> 00:58:20,514
Are you telling me
that my son is gonna die?

574
00:58:20,625 --> 00:58:22,593
No, he's not.

575
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:26,857
Once incubated, the virus
becomes airborne...

576
00:58:26,965 --> 00:58:29,525
so anyone he breathes on
gets infected.

577
00:58:29,634 --> 00:58:32,432
Your son was a weapon.
The target is his father.

578
00:58:32,537 --> 00:58:34,630
Jefferson? Well, why?

579
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:37,402
Because of the conference.
It's the only logical answer.

580
00:58:37,509 --> 00:58:40,706
Every drug enforcement agency
in the hemisphere in one room.

581
00:58:40,812 --> 00:58:43,542
Your husband breathes:
The room dies.

582
00:58:46,518 --> 00:58:49,112
Please.

583
00:58:49,221 --> 00:58:51,416
You gotta trust me, Audrey.

584
00:58:59,397 --> 00:59:03,299
- Can you get to him?
- What are you gonna do?

585
00:59:03,401 --> 00:59:06,564
Find the guy responsible.
He has more of this.

586
00:59:07,739 --> 00:59:11,641
- For you and everybody else.
- For you now.

587
00:59:29,461 --> 00:59:31,429
We have a guest.

588
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:34,465
- You're burnin' up.
- I'm okay.

589
00:59:35,867 --> 00:59:38,062
You gotta go. Go.

590
00:59:41,239 --> 00:59:42,866
Don't move!

591
01:00:27,619 --> 01:00:30,281
- Is the governor here?
- Everybody's gonna be here.

592
01:00:30,388 --> 01:00:33,687
The governor, delegates
from all over the world.

593
01:00:33,792 --> 01:00:35,919
Just a second. Hello?

594
01:00:36,027 --> 01:00:38,359
- You can't go to the conference.
- Is everything all right?

595
01:00:38,463 --> 01:00:41,432
...to give him a deadly virus.

596
01:00:41,533 --> 01:00:44,229
- I can't hear you. I'm inside.
- Now I've got it, and so do you.

597
01:00:44,336 --> 01:00:47,499
- Audrey, I can't hear you. - Their plan
is to infect everyone at the conference.

598
01:00:47,606 --> 01:00:50,040
- I'm gonna have to call you back.
- Jeff!

599
01:00:51,977 --> 01:00:55,879
Mr. Billings, are you all right?

600
01:00:55,981 --> 01:00:58,040
- I'm all right. Come on.
- You sure?

601
01:00:58,149 --> 01:01:00,913
- Yeah.
- Okay.

602
01:01:20,205 --> 01:01:22,765
- Allo.
- You still a guest of the government?

603
01:01:22,874 --> 01:01:26,742
They gave me the five-star
accommodation.

604
01:01:26,845 --> 01:01:29,939
- Let me guess. You need my help?
- Are you near the computer?

605
01:01:30,048 --> 01:01:33,211
It's practically my pillow.

606
01:01:33,318 --> 01:01:36,287
- So, how do you want to start?
- I don't know. I have nothing.

607
01:01:36,388 --> 01:01:40,381
Ah, my favorite type
of investigation.

608
01:01:40,492 --> 01:01:42,790
Let's see.

609
01:01:42,894 --> 01:01:44,794
Alors.

610
01:01:44,896 --> 01:01:49,026
I'd like to take this opportunity
to introduce you to my delegates.

611
01:01:49,134 --> 01:01:51,864
Breathe. That's right.
Breathe, my friend. Breathe.

612
01:01:54,072 --> 01:01:57,007
Tomorrow, once these bastards
are out of the way...

613
01:01:57,108 --> 01:01:59,668
and their cooperation agreements
are dead and buried...

614
01:01:59,778 --> 01:02:02,269
you know what the biggest
problem is going to be?

615
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:05,281
- What?
- Counting the money.

616
01:02:09,454 --> 01:02:12,582
- I can't wait for tomorrow.
- Ay, ay, ay!

617
01:02:12,691 --> 01:02:15,489
It's easier with you.

618
01:02:16,895 --> 01:02:20,194
Ahhh, Gianni Chellini.

619
01:02:20,298 --> 01:02:23,062
He hires himself out to anyone
looking to make trouble...

620
01:02:23,168 --> 01:02:25,136
Red Brigades, Shining Path.

621
01:02:27,205 --> 01:02:30,368
Someone accessed the database
on the 15th floor.

622
01:02:30,475 --> 01:02:35,174
That's Gonzalez.
He's on vacation.

623
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:39,808
Ah, he was behind the hostage taking
of the public ministers in Geneva.

624
01:02:39,918 --> 01:02:42,716
That was a nice piece of work.

625
01:02:47,158 --> 01:02:48,459
Give me an address.

626
01:02:48,558 --> 01:02:51,959
Miami, East Island,
Pelican Drive, 26900.

627
01:02:52,063 --> 01:02:54,361
- We found the car.
- You're one great cop, Tarconi.

628
01:02:54,466 --> 01:02:56,525
Ah, thank you for the compliment.

629
01:02:56,634 --> 01:02:59,159
Now I'm going back to sleep.

630
01:03:01,573 --> 01:03:04,371
Hmm. Maybe not.

631
01:03:06,244 --> 01:03:08,974
Move out of the way!

632
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:12,208
- Move over.
- What do you- Sure!

633
01:03:12,317 --> 01:03:15,081
This is the second gun
in my car tonight.

634
01:03:15,186 --> 01:03:19,418
I may be out of a job,
out of a house...

635
01:03:19,524 --> 01:03:21,219
Mommy?

636
01:03:21,326 --> 01:03:24,261
Hmm? Honey.

637
01:03:24,362 --> 01:03:28,059
- You feeling better?
- A little bit.

638
01:03:28,166 --> 01:03:30,361
Why don't you try
to go back to sleep, okay?

639
01:03:37,142 --> 01:03:39,667
Ma'am, are you all right?

640
01:03:48,486 --> 01:03:52,354
Jefferson? Jefferson, you okay?

641
01:04:56,821 --> 01:04:58,846
Okay, do it.

642
01:05:11,669 --> 01:05:15,196
- What are you doing?
- You know, last night got me thinking.

643
01:05:15,306 --> 01:05:18,605
How do you transport
the antidote safely?

644
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:20,610
We need something
that won't break...

645
01:05:20,712 --> 01:05:22,270
something that can't be stolen...

646
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:24,644
something totally secure.

647
01:05:24,749 --> 01:05:26,376
Me.

648
01:05:32,423 --> 01:05:34,288
Impressive.

649
01:05:34,392 --> 01:05:36,690
Get dressed.

650
01:05:37,896 --> 01:05:39,796
Stop him.

651
01:05:41,132 --> 01:05:44,033
- These your friends?
- Not yet.

652
01:05:53,278 --> 01:05:56,406
- Where'd they go?
- The garage.

653
01:05:56,514 --> 01:05:59,483
- I'm out of ammo.
- Me too.

654
01:05:59,584 --> 01:06:01,745
- So am I.
- Where are the reloads?

655
01:06:01,853 --> 01:06:03,684
The garage.

656
01:06:04,856 --> 01:06:07,723
Check the house!
Go, go, go!

657
01:06:11,663 --> 01:06:13,756
Forget the ammo! Get him!

658
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:52,461
- What you want me to do?
- Keep the meter running.

659
01:07:52,563 --> 01:07:56,397
Fine. Don't worry, baby.

660
01:07:56,501 --> 01:07:59,698
Safe now. You're safe.
You're so beautiful.

661
01:07:59,804 --> 01:08:02,432
Remind me of my yellow
poom-poom rider.

662
01:09:18,716 --> 01:09:21,549
Don't move.

663
01:09:21,652 --> 01:09:24,120
- Oh, Mr. Driver.
- I'll blow you into tomorrow.

664
01:09:24,222 --> 01:09:26,713
But then I'd bleed what you
came for all over the floor.

665
01:09:26,824 --> 01:09:28,724
You wouldn't want this,
would you?

666
01:09:28,826 --> 01:09:32,057
Not after you worked so hard
trying to get to the antidote.

667
01:09:32,163 --> 01:09:36,293
Take a good look, Frank Martin.
I'm a cure for what ails you.

668
01:09:36,401 --> 01:09:38,562
I'm the only cure for what ails you.

669
01:09:38,669 --> 01:09:41,934
I am the antidote.

670
01:09:42,039 --> 01:09:45,372
But nice try. I'm impressed.
Didn't give you enough credit.

671
01:09:45,476 --> 01:09:48,309
Took more than a driver
to figure this out.

672
01:09:48,413 --> 01:09:50,472
- I haven't figured it all out yet.
- Perhaps I can help you.

673
01:09:50,581 --> 01:09:53,209
What part are you a little...
how you say... thick on?

674
01:09:53,317 --> 01:09:55,547
You. Why?

675
01:09:55,653 --> 01:09:58,281
Ah, well, that's the easy part.

676
01:09:58,389 --> 01:10:00,721
It's a business deal,
pure and simple.

677
01:10:00,825 --> 01:10:02,816
I'm for hire
to the highest bidder.

678
01:10:02,927 --> 01:10:06,761
And in this case, the highest bidder
was the Colombian cocaine cartels...

679
01:10:06,864 --> 01:10:09,992
that wanted these pesky
little men off their backs.

680
01:10:10,101 --> 01:10:13,559
You think killing all these politicians
is gonna make things easier for them?

681
01:10:13,671 --> 01:10:17,163
That's not my problem.
I was hired to do a job.

682
01:10:17,275 --> 01:10:21,712
I did the job, like you.
Just... my pay is better.

683
01:10:23,181 --> 01:10:25,843
My hair and my suit too.

684
01:10:27,919 --> 01:10:29,978
Mm, Lola.

685
01:10:30,087 --> 01:10:34,456
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a plane to catch.

686
01:10:34,559 --> 01:10:36,652
Kill him.

687
01:10:36,761 --> 01:10:38,752
Ciao, ciao.

688
01:10:41,599 --> 01:10:43,829
Don't even blink.

689
01:10:43,935 --> 01:10:46,199
- What's in this for you?
- Pleasure.

690
01:10:49,474 --> 01:10:51,374
In killing you.

691
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:31,265
We're coming to you live
from the Key Biscayne Causeway...

692
01:12:31,375 --> 01:12:35,539
where at least 10 police cars are in
hot pursuit of a stolen red pickup truck.

693
01:12:39,984 --> 01:12:43,249
Oh, my! This is just not...
Jim, are you getting that?

694
01:12:43,354 --> 01:12:48,155
There's another car that is swaying past
the police as if it were standing still.

695
01:12:48,259 --> 01:12:52,093
- Son of a bitch can drive. Whoo.
- Yes, he can.

696
01:13:38,542 --> 01:13:41,204
We have clearance
for takeoff, Mr. Chellini.

697
01:13:41,312 --> 01:13:45,874
Sit back, enjoy your flight, and we
will be in Colombia before you know it.

698
01:14:29,627 --> 01:14:32,221
We have a problem with the
landing gear. It won't come up.

699
01:14:32,329 --> 01:14:34,593
- I'm turning back to land.
- Can we fly with the problem?

700
01:14:34,699 --> 01:14:36,101
Yeah, theoretically.

701
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:38,601
Then you'll land
when we get to Colombia.

702
01:14:39,870 --> 01:14:42,270
Go and see if you can
lift it manually.

703
01:14:42,373 --> 01:14:46,241
Sorry for the inconvenience,
Mr. Chellini. Nothing to worry about.

704
01:14:50,815 --> 01:14:52,715
Sorry. Flight's been canceled.

705
01:14:52,817 --> 01:14:57,584
I'm sorry to inform you
that you have been canceled.

706
01:14:57,688 --> 01:14:59,747
Have a seat.

707
01:15:00,858 --> 01:15:02,382
Relax.

708
01:15:04,028 --> 01:15:07,259
Drink something, and let's
get to know each other.

709
01:15:07,364 --> 01:15:10,800
I think I know
everything I need to know.

710
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:58,934
Shit!

711
01:18:38,042 --> 01:18:41,239
Five points.
What has eyes but no ears...

712
01:18:41,345 --> 01:18:44,940
skin but no hair, it's white
inside and brown outside?

713
01:18:45,049 --> 01:18:46,983
- Mom?
- A worm?

714
01:18:47,084 --> 01:18:50,918
- Wrong. Dad?
- A caterpillar.

715
01:18:51,021 --> 01:18:52,921
Wrong.

716
01:18:53,023 --> 01:18:55,685
A potato.

717
01:18:57,828 --> 01:18:59,762
May I help you?

718
01:18:59,863 --> 01:19:01,763
I was just leaving.

719
01:19:01,865 --> 01:19:04,425
He'll be out of here in a couple
of weeks. Just a couple of weeks.

720
01:19:04,535 --> 01:19:06,469
- Coconut?
- Wrong.

721
01:19:06,570 --> 01:19:09,198
- A snake?
- Wrong.

722
01:19:10,674 --> 01:19:13,768
- A peanut?
- Yuck.

723
01:19:13,877 --> 01:19:15,936
- A hot dog?
- Wrong.

724
01:19:16,046 --> 01:19:17,980
Uh...

725
01:19:28,959 --> 01:19:31,553
- That was fast.
- Yeah.

726
01:19:31,662 --> 01:19:34,028
Didn't want you to miss your plane.

727
01:19:34,131 --> 01:19:36,122
That's very thoughtful of you.

728
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:45,808
Want a ride, big boy?

729
01:19:45,909 --> 01:19:48,241
Check it out, man.

730
01:19:50,614 --> 01:19:53,139
You won't believe what
happened to me last night.

731
01:20:00,124 --> 01:20:03,651
I have something for you. I figured
since you never got to the beach...

732
01:20:03,761 --> 01:20:09,199
I know. Water is water, sand is sand.
Here, there, it's all the same.

733
01:20:09,299 --> 01:20:11,824
Air France flight 069 to Paris.

734
01:20:11,935 --> 01:20:14,597
Thank you, Frank.
It was an interesting vacation.

735
01:20:14,705 --> 01:20:18,905
- What more could one ask for?
- Ah. Yeah.

736
01:20:19,009 --> 01:20:21,477
- Au revoir, Frank.
- Au revoir, my friend.

737
01:20:21,578 --> 01:20:23,944
- Have a good flight.
- I doubt it.

738
01:20:24,048 --> 01:20:26,175
They said it is all headwinds.

739
01:20:26,283 --> 01:20:29,514
I guess we can't have
everything we wish for, can we?

740
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:31,451
No, we can't.

741
01:20:46,904 --> 01:20:48,804
Yeah.

742
01:20:48,906 --> 01:20:51,431
I'm looking for a transporter.

743
01:20:54,845 --> 01:20:56,779
I'm listening.
