1
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:32,390
- Is this the last one?
- I don't know.

2
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,489
There's no ether, either.

3
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,222
Jesus Christ.

4
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:39,497
You there! Is this the last one?

5
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:48,333
God, what a mess.

6
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,509
At least there's no gangrene.

7
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,402
There will be if it doesn't come off soon.

8
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:57,473
I can't saw if I can't keep my eyes open.

9
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,283
I'm sorry.

10
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:04,781
Let's coffee up. He can wait a few more minutes.

11
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,092
God!

12
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:47,510
Glass.

13
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,123
- Is that Tucker's men?
- Yes, sir. I think it is.

14
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,356
How long has it been like this?

15
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:59,330
We found 'em this morning, sir.
They've been here for two days.

16
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:11,642
Is that you, Lieutenant?

17
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,742
Sons of bitches.

18
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,752
Come on. You better take cover.

19
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:27,584
I ain't kidding. These boys are shooters.
Come on. Go under cover.

20
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,728
There you go.

21
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,537
You went to the hospital?

22
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,697
It was no good.

23
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,108
What's going on here?

24
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,243
What's going on here?

25
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:52,178
That seems to be the question, all right.

26
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,079
See, you could ask the major...

27
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,446
...but he don't know.

28
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,854
He's busy.

29
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,825
He's busy trying to figure out
how come the officers' mess...

30
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,919
...run out of peach ice cream.

31
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,723
Then, of course, you got the general.

32
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,024
He come up to see the show.

33
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,127
All he knows is there ain't no show...

34
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:14,330
...which ain't entirely correct
'cause we started a balloon up...

35
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:17,103
...but they shot her down
before we got off the ground.

36
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:20,771
Nobody's made a run either way.
It's been a standoff all damned day.

37
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,850
Now, the major, he's looking at the general.

38
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:30,149
He's thinking to himself,
"I better do something."

39
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:31,813
You know what that means.

40
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:35,019
I sure as hell don't want to be
the first one across this field.

41
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,629
They're supposed to be beat up just like us.

42
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:42,198
Hell, everybody knows
Tucker's men are tough as cobs.

43
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:46,468
So far, the only thing been killed out here
is three milking cows.

44
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,640
Course, that's about to change.

45
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,409
You son of a bitch.

46
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,843
You know, some of the boys are saying
if we ain't gonna fight...

47
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,922
...we could just settle
this whole business with a little...

48
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:07,789
...high-stakes poker.

49
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,794
Wouldn't that be a sight?

50
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:13,320
A bunch of fellas
sitting in the middle of this field...

51
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,696
...drawing cards.

52
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,601
What is it, sir?

53
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:27,145
Looks like a suicide.

54
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,108
Tucker!

55
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,286
What's he doing?

56
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:13,116
- What did you say to him?
- I didn't say nothing.

57
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,317
Come on back, you son of a bitch!

58
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:44,722
- You won't make it no second time!
- All right by me.

59
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,928
Forgive me, Father.

60
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,628
- He's coming back again!
- Here he comes, boys!

61
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,431
- Ready!
- I got him.

62
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,905
Don't...

63
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,974
Don't take off my foot.

64
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:26,280
You rest easy, son. You'll keep your foot.

65
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:29,277
With God as my judge, you'll keep it.

66
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,487
- Bring up my ambulance.
- Sir?

67
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,829
Bring up my ambulance,
and bring my surgeon with it!

68
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,333
We got an officer
who's worth something lying here.

69
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,422
<i>"The strangeness of this life
cannot be measured.</i>

70
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,263
<i>"In trying to produce my own death...</i>

71
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:19,133
<i>"...I was elevated to the status of a living hero.</i>

72
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,070
<i>"I was also awarded Cisco...</i>

73
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,132
<i>"...the trusty mount that carried
me across the field that day.</i>

74
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:28,146
<i>"And on full recovery,
was given transfer to any station I desired.</i>

75
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,146
<i>"The bloody slaughter continues in the east
as I arrive at Fort Hayes.</i>

76
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:36,951
<i>"A tiny island of men and material
surrounded by a never-ending sea of prairie."</i>

77
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,212
Lieutenant.

78
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,432
Where can I find Maj. Fambrough?

79
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,098
Down at the end of the hall.

80
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,505
Thank you.

81
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,183
"Lt. John J. Dunbar."

82
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,925
Lt. John J. Dunbar?

83
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,623
- Yes, sir.
- "Yes, sir."

84
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,628
Indian fighter.

85
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,861
Excuse me?

86
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:32,460
It says here that you're
to be posted on the frontier.

87
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,903
The frontier is Indian country.

88
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,464
I quickly deduced that you're an Indian fighter.

89
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,170
I did not ascend to this position
by being stupid.

90
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,145
- No, sir.
- "No, sir."

91
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:49,350
It says here that you've been decorated.

92
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,717
Yes, sir.

93
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,590
And they sent you here to be posted?

94
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:58,357
Actually, sir, I'm here at my own request.

95
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,330
Really? Why?

96
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,995
I've always wanted to see the frontier.

97
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,068
You want to see the frontier?

98
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,234
Yes, sir.

99
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,768
Before it's gone.

100
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:19,244
Such a smart lad, coming straight to me.

101
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:26,951
Sir...

102
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:28,754
...Knight.

103
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,856
I am sending you on a knight's errand.

104
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,459
You will report to Captain Cargill...

105
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,502
...at the furthermost outpost of the realm...

106
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,663
...Fort Sedgewick.

107
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,872
My personal seal will assure your safety...

108
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,506
...through many miles
of wild and hostile country.

109
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:02,483
- I was wondering...
- Yes?

110
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:06,658
I was wondering, sir, how will I be getting there?

111
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,362
You think I don't know?

112
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,460
- No, sir.
- You think that.

113
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,732
- It's just that I don't know...
- Hold your tongue.

114
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,400
I am in a generous mood
and I will grant your boon.

115
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,534
See that peasant out there?

116
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,436
He calls himself Timmons.

117
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:24,471
He's going there this very afternoon.
You can ride with him if you like.

118
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,078
He knows the way. Thank you. That is all.

119
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,164
Sir Knight?

120
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,235
I've just pissed in my pants...

121
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:52,800
...and nobody can do anything about it.

122
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:08,985
To your journey!

123
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,422
To my journey!

124
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,312
Haw!

125
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,781
Over a little bit, Jim!

126
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:43,154
- Have this by tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.

127
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,162
I'll have my crown now.

128
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:49,399
- Sir?
- I'll have my crown now!

129
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,670
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Are you deaf, fool?

130
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,173
I said I'll have my crown right now!

131
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,333
Now!

132
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:02,702
No.

133
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,046
- I'll get your crown.
- No.

134
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:17,284
Sir?

135
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,157
Major?

136
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,397
The king is dead.

137
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,939
Long live the king.

138
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:59,301
Get these kids out of here, come on!

139
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,648
Haw, Jim and Jake!

140
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,219
Gee a little bit, Jim!

141
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,260
The hell was that?

142
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,165
What is that?

143
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:15,669
What the hell is that?

144
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,334
Why don't you put that in your book?

145
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:54,569
<i>"Were it not for my companion...</i>

146
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,274
<i>"...I believe I would be having the time of my life.</i>

147
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,748
<i>"I know he means well...</i>

148
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:02,116
<i>"...but he is quite possibly
the foulest man I have ever met."</i>

149
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:39,013
How far you make the Fort?

150
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,482
Far.

151
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,552
How far?

152
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,498
Forty, fifty mile, maybe.

153
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,699
What's the big hurry on Sedgewick?

154
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,299
It's to be my post.

155
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:55,834
My home.

156
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,737
You ain't hard to please, I'll give you that much.

157
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,487
Look yonder.

158
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,562
What you got there?

159
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,145
Somebody back east is saying,
"Why don't she write?"

160
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,314
You stupid bastard.

161
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,588
Get up, Timmons.

162
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:04,729
Get up.

163
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:19,305
Get up.

164
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,079
Come on. Get up.

165
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:28,055
Get up!

166
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:36,833
Someone poked me in my butt. Was that you?

167
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,601
Goddamn it!

168
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,803
I'm gonna have a welt.

169
00:26:57,482 --> 00:26:59,040
Cpl. Guest?

170
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,993
You don't have to talk to me,
just please come out.

171
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:37,518
It's the end.

172
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,788
Assemble the men in front of my quarters.

173
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,369
You hate me.

174
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:57,764
But I feel none of the same for you.

175
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:01,202
You men stayed.

176
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,681
You stayed after they took all our horses.

177
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,411
You stayed after all the others deserted.

178
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,418
You stayed after the army failed to resupply us.

179
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:23,132
I have looked for that wagon from Fort Hayes...

180
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:24,801
...just as you have...

181
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:27,204
...day after miserable day.

182
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:33,002
And all I can say is that I'm proud of you.

183
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:38,144
Now get your things, men.
We're leaving this place.

184
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,745
The army can go to hell.

185
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:46,012
Go.

186
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:47,849
Get your things.

187
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:29,990
How come we haven't seen any buffalo?

188
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:32,460
You can't figure the stinking buffalo.

189
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:35,839
You can't.
Sometimes you won't see any for days.

190
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:39,240
Other times, they'll be thick,
like curls on a whore.

191
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,945
What about Indians?

192
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:46,381
Indians? Goddamn Indians!

193
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:50,312
You just as soon not see 'em
unless the bastards are dead.

194
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:52,856
They're nothing but thieves and beggars.

195
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:54,547
Ho, up there!

196
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:27,244
Not what you would call
much of a going concern now, is it?

197
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,287
Go down there.

198
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:36,417
- Why? There ain't nothing down there.
- Because I said.

199
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,091
Go down there.

200
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:45,863
There, son of a bitch!

201
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,421

204
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,256
Everybody's run off or got killed.

205
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:08,880
All right. Let's unload the wagon.

206
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:11,886
What? What, and leave it all here?

207
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,118
I'm staying, too.

208
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,560
There ain't nothing here.

209
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:20,663
No, not at the moment.

210
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:23,133
We don't know what's happened.

211
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,471
Things being as they are...

212
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:31,333
...we might as well
just turn around and get headed back.

- Jesus H. Christ.
- This is my post.

All right, put it down.

222
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:56,194
And these are the post provisions, all right?
Now get your ass off the wagon...

223
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:58,394
- Put it down!
- And help me unload.

224
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:01,233
We're just havin' a conversation,
now put it down.

225

I'll let them know where you are.

00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:24,099
...but I have not been out to see it.

353
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:28,963
But the buffalo are late.

354
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:32,633
And I always worry
about the bellies of our children.

355
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:38,342
I was thinking of a dance.

356
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:42,214
Yes. A dance is always a good idea.

357
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:47,518
It would be good to have a strong sign.

358
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:05,402
There's a funny thing about signs.

359
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:08,069
We know when they are bad or good.

360
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:13,839
Sometimes they are strange
and it's hard to understand them.

361
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:16,715
A smart man will think on these things.

362
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:21,847
If he is still confused, he will tell somebody.

363
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,553
For instance, he might tell you or me.

364
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:26,595
A smart man always does this.

365
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:35,068
I have seen such a sign.

366
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:37,631
Really?

367
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,056
I saw a man.

368
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:57,183
A naked, white man.

369
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,887
Are you sure it was a man?

370
01:00:01,197 --> 01:00:03,324
I saw his sex.

371
01:00:05,668 --> 01:00:07,192
Did you speak to him?

372
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:11,065
No.

373
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:28,455
<i>"It's been two days now, and nothing.</i>

374
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:31,584
<i>"My presence here must
have been reported by now.</i>

375
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:34,562
<i>"Have made all the preparations I can think of.</i>

376
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:37,156
<i>"Cannot mount an adequate defense
as I am still alone.</i>

377
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:39,895
<i>"But will try to make
a big impression when they come.</i>

378
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:41,297
<i>"Waiting.</i>

379
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:43,068
<i>"Post-script...</i>

380
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:46,597
<i>"The man I encountered was
a magnificent-looking fellow."</i>

381
01:00:57,453 --> 01:01:01,321
He might be a god.

382
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:06,294
Or a white chief with special abilities.

383
01:01:06,362 --> 01:01:08,728
That is why we should talk with him.

384
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:14,165
I do not care for this talk about this white man.

385
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:18,071
Whatever he is, he is not a Sioux,
and that makes him less.

386
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:22,510
When I hear that more whites are coming,
I want to laugh.

387
01:01:22,578 --> 01:01:24,910
We took a hundred horses from these people.

388
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:27,381
There was no honor in it.

389
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:30,142
They don't ride well. They don't shoot well.

390
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:33,017
They're dirty.

391
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:36,889
Those soldiers could not even make it
through one winter here.

392
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:39,926
And these people are said to flourish?

393
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:42,487
I think they will all be dead soon.

394
01:01:44,934 --> 01:01:48,597
I think this fool is probably lost.

395
01:01:54,077 --> 01:01:57,638
Wind In His Hair's words are strong
and I have heard them.

396
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:00,706
It's true the whites are a poor race
and hard to understand.

397
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:04,142
But make no mistake. The whites are coming.

398
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,347
Even our enemies agree on this.

399
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:10,085
So when I see one man alone
without fear in our country...

400
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:14,926
...I do not think he is lost.
I think he may have medicine.

401
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:18,433
I see someone who might speak...

402
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:21,732
...for all the white people who are coming.

403
01:02:21,804 --> 01:02:26,138
I think this is a person
with which treaties might be struck.

404
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:35,450
Kicking Bird is always looking ahead
and that is good.

405
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:39,682
But this man cannot cover our lodges
or feed our children.

406
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:43,522
He is nothing to us.

407
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,356
I will take some men.

408
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,555
We will shoot some arrows into this white man.

409
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:51,259
If he truly has medicine, he will not be hurt.

410
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:54,064
If he has no medicine, he will be dead.

411
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:03,003
No man can tell another what to do.

412
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:06,480
But killing a white man is a delicate matter.

413
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:10,576
If you kill one, more are sure to come.

414
01:03:15,992 --> 01:03:20,622
It's easy to become confused
by these questions.

415
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:23,221
It's hard to know what to do.

416
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:28,737
We should talk about this some more.

417
01:03:29,772 --> 01:03:32,570
That is all I have to say.

418
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:09,543
What's the matter, now?

419
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:12,274
We don't think this is such a good idea.

420
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:15,347
If we take the horse of a white god...

421
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:17,648
...they will make up songs about us.

422
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:19,655
Maybe.

423
01:04:20,823 --> 01:04:23,087
They will ask us to go on raids.

424
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:26,185
Who gets the horse?

425
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:27,251
I do.

426
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:33,698
I do, but we share. Now who can say
this is not a great plan?

427
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,935
It's always the same.

428
01:04:40,776 --> 01:04:42,505
Every time.

429
01:04:48,918 --> 01:04:51,409
Yes, sir, I have. No, I'll ask, sir.

430
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:18,377
We'll be heroes.

431
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:23,714
They'll write songs about us.

432
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,923
What happened?

433
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:47,269
I don't know. My arm doesn't work.

434
01:05:49,912 --> 01:05:53,575
You shouldn't have fallen off.
Now we'll get in trouble.

435
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:56,276
It was your idea.

436
01:05:56,352 --> 01:06:01,813
My idea was only to take the horse,
not fall down.

437
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:08,454
Otter hurt himself.

438
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:13,658
What are you looking at?
I'm the one who's hurt.

439
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:18,139
I will be when my father finds out.
His bow will be across my back.

440
01:08:41,984 --> 01:08:45,010
I am Wind In His Hair.

441
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,647
I am Wind In His Hair.

442
01:08:49,658 --> 01:08:53,059
Do you see that I am not afraid of you?

443
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,785
Do you see?

444
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:11,406
The party that went against the Utes
is coming back.

445
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:15,510
There are many hearts on the ground.

446
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:53,305
<i>"I realize now that I have been wrong.</i>

447
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:55,343
<i>"All this time, I've been waiting.</i>

448
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:56,935
<i>"Waiting for what?</i>

449
01:11:57,012 --> 01:11:58,502
<i>"For someone to find me?</i>

450
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:00,411
<i>"For Indians to take my horse?</i>

451
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:02,109
<i>"To see a buffalo?</i>

452
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:05,516
<i>"Since I have arrived at this post
I have been walking on eggs.</i>

453
01:12:05,587 --> 01:12:08,420
<i>"It has become a bad habit and I am sick of it.</i>

454
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,924
<i>"Tomorrow morning,
I will ride out to the Indians.</i>

455
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:13,587
<i>"I do not know the outcome
or wisdom of this thinking...</i>

456
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:17,257
<i>"...but I've become a target
and a target makes a poor impression.</i>

457
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,130
<i>"I am through waiting."</i>

458
01:12:20,235 --> 01:12:22,135
What are you looking at?

459
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:54,486
Son of a bitch!

460
01:14:07,509 --> 01:14:08,771
No. Wait.

461
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:10,938
Wait.

462
01:14:13,382 --> 01:14:14,440
Wait.

463
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:19,482
You need help. You're hurt.

464
01:14:19,555 --> 01:14:21,580
- You need...
- No!

465
01:14:23,525 --> 01:14:26,085
Let me... You need help.

466
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:29,455
You need help. You're hurt. Let me help you.

467
01:14:33,936 --> 01:14:35,335
You're hurt.

468
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:41,670
Don't.
