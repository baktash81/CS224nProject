48
00:03:23,483 --> 00:03:24,916
That's a good idea.

49
00:03:24,985 --> 00:03:28,216
Why don't you wait here,
and I'll go and get us a drink?

50
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:35,890
It'd been better if I'd thought
of it five minutes ago.

51
00:03:41,735 --> 00:03:42,997
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

52
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:45,094
Whoa.

53
00:03:45,171 --> 00:03:46,729
Whoa, there.

54
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:52,976
We are here, sir.

55
00:03:53,046 --> 00:03:54,707
Here, I'll give you a hand.

56
00:03:54,781 --> 00:03:56,476
You do,
and you'll get my foot,

57
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,915
you jailhouse jellyfish.

58
00:03:57,984 --> 00:03:59,110
Mind the wind, sir.

59
00:03:59,185 --> 00:04:01,813
And mind your business,
Mansfield.

60
00:04:04,424 --> 00:04:05,891
Great glory.

61
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:08,587
Take a look at that sight,
will ya?

62
00:04:08,662 --> 00:04:10,095
Mine.

63
00:04:10,163 --> 00:04:14,361
Bloodshy territory
as far as the eye can see.

64
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:16,629
The doctors
are quite concerned.

65
00:04:16,703 --> 00:04:18,227
How much time does he have?

66
00:04:18,305 --> 00:04:19,704
According to the doctors,

67
00:04:19,773 --> 00:04:22,708
if he doesn't take care
of himself, it will be soon.

68
00:04:22,776 --> 00:04:25,370
How much time if he does
take care of himself?

69
00:04:25,445 --> 00:04:28,243
They give me
at least two days.

70
00:04:28,315 --> 00:04:29,942
And that's why we're here.

71
00:04:30,016 --> 00:04:34,544
To get a last look at what
I'm leaving to my heirs.

72
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:36,350
Heirs?

73
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:38,391
The land, the town, the money.

74
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,618
When you say ‘heirs,’

75
00:04:39,693 --> 00:04:42,059
you do mean your son
Wild Billy, don't ya?

76
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:44,961
When I say ‘heirs,’
I mean just that.

77
00:04:45,031 --> 00:04:47,465
I found my other boy.

78
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:50,298
Many years ago,
I grew a might too wild

79
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,736
for my bride's
highfalutin ways.

80
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:56,503
So one day, she up
and ran off back to England,

81
00:04:56,576 --> 00:04:58,567
taking half my sons.

82
00:04:58,645 --> 00:05:00,078
Half?

83
00:05:00,146 --> 00:05:01,977
You mean you got two boys?

84
00:05:02,048 --> 00:05:04,175
Traced him to Philadelphia.

85
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,150
This town needs another
Wild Billy

86
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:07,550
like it needs an earthquake.

87
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:10,988
You eat them words afore I pound
your face into a flapjack.

88
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:13,753
We better write a new will
so everything's fair.

89
00:05:13,827 --> 00:05:16,728
You can stick your quill
back in the goose.

90
00:05:16,796 --> 00:05:18,957
I already writ out my will.

91
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:22,627
And you ain't gettin' it
until I'm ready to go.

92
00:05:22,702 --> 00:05:24,260
But a new will?

93
00:05:24,337 --> 00:05:26,601
Mansfield, what do you know
about this?

94
00:05:26,673 --> 00:05:28,470
Absolutely nothing, sir.

95
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,133
I never heard of it.

96
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,370
What are we gonna do?

97
00:05:31,444 --> 00:05:34,174
Will you wait a minute
while I think about this?

98
00:05:34,247 --> 00:05:35,771
There's gotta be an answer.

99
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:38,647
Whoa!

100
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,188

101
00:05:57,037 --> 00:05:58,937

125
00:06:48,688 --> 00:06:52,055
Those guys over on 10th Street
were listening a lot better.

126
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,717
They were throwing rocks.

127
00:06:53,793 --> 00:06:55,283
Eli, is that you?

128
00:06:55,361 --> 00:06:56,487
Oh, Father Joshua.

129
00:06:56,563 --> 00:06:58,963
I'm sorry to bother you
during your work,

130
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:01,967
but I have a very important
letter for you.

131
00:07:02,035 --> 00:07:04,503
It's marked ‘special delivery’
and ‘urgent.’

132
00:07:04,571 --> 00:07:06,038
And look at that postmark.

133
00:07:06,106 --> 00:07:07,596
Arizona territory.

134
00:07:07,674 --> 00:07:09,335
That's way out West.

135
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:10,774
That's curious.

136
00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:13,939
Good shot, Harry.

137
00:07:14,013 --> 00:07:15,742
I didn't know my father.

138
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:17,749
I didn't even know
I had a father.

139
00:07:17,817 --> 00:07:20,479
Now I've found and lost him
all in one letter.

140
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:23,420
I guess you're an orphan,
Brother Eli, like us.

141
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,287
At least he's a rich one.

142
00:07:25,358 --> 00:07:27,724
Only when we are giving,
Brother Marcus.

143
00:07:27,794 --> 00:07:30,024
Of course, that's what
you meant to say.

144
00:07:30,096 --> 00:07:31,188
Oh, sure.

145
00:07:31,264 --> 00:07:33,232
How rich are you gonna be?

146
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:36,598
Well, it appears that there
is a considerable inheritance.

147
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:38,728
It mentions land
and there is a town,

148
00:07:38,805 --> 00:07:41,399
and it says, ‘A considerable
amount of money.’

149
00:07:41,474 --> 00:07:42,532
Ha ha ha.

150
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:45,976
Imagine the good work we could
do with that kind of wealth.

151
00:07:46,045 --> 00:07:48,411
I guess you'll be out there
a long time.

152
00:07:48,481 --> 00:07:50,779
Just long enough
to claim my inheritance,

153
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,442
and then we'll be back.

154
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,282
You mean
we're going with you?

155
00:07:54,354 --> 00:07:58,051
Brother Demetrius says
it might help your education.

156
00:07:58,124 --> 00:07:59,056
Yahoo!

157
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:02,424
Out with the cowboys and
the guns and the shoot-outs!

158
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:05,191
No, Brother Marcus,
not in my father's town, no.

159
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:09,292
Remember, whosoever seeks
peace and love shall find it.

160
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:12,736
If you have more dreaming to do,
do it with your eyes shut.

161
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:15,366
We've got a long journey
tomorrow. God bless.

162
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:17,432
- God bless.
- God bless.

163
00:08:35,028 --> 00:08:37,053
1, 2!

164
00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:39,789
Whoo-hoo!

165
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:42,835
You have a go at me now, Sam.

166
00:08:42,902 --> 00:08:45,735
Oh, thank you, Billy.
Thank you.

167
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:48,973
Hold it!

168
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:52,136
Easy, Billy.
We know you're grievin'.

169
00:08:52,212 --> 00:08:55,670
- We ain't lookin' for trouble.
- Well, you found it.

170
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:57,807
Next time,
it won't be your hardware.

171
00:08:57,884 --> 00:08:59,749
It'll be your head.

172
00:09:01,821 --> 00:09:04,346
Aw, quit shakin', Doc!

173
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:06,119
You made me miss.

174
00:09:06,192 --> 00:09:09,127
I'm sorry, Billy.
I'm sorry.

175
00:09:09,195 --> 00:09:12,187
Set 'em up again, Red Dog.

176
00:09:12,265 --> 00:09:14,028
What's up, Ragsdale?

177
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,227
I'd like a little privacy.

178
00:09:16,302 --> 00:09:18,327
You, come inside.

179
00:09:23,977 --> 00:09:28,778
Wonder what he's gonna do when
he finds out he's got a brother.

180
00:09:28,848 --> 00:09:31,908
Don't worry about a brother
that ain't gonna show up.

181
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:33,111
How's that?

182
00:09:33,186 --> 00:09:37,054
Boys, you got a job to do.

183
00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:44,091
Marcus, look.
Something's coming.

184
00:09:44,163 --> 00:09:46,427
Yeah.
It's a stagecoach.

185
00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:48,023
The kind that gets held up.

186
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:49,090
I hope not.

187
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:50,726
Don't worry.

188
00:09:50,803 --> 00:09:54,398
That's why the armory
is riding shotgun.

189
00:09:54,474 --> 00:09:57,409
Eli, the stagecoach is here!

190
00:10:00,613 --> 00:10:02,046
Yah! Yah! Go on!

191
00:10:02,115 --> 00:10:05,983
Get goin', now!
Yah! Yah! Hah!

192
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:07,815
Come on, now!

193
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:11,489
Whoa!

194
00:10:11,557 --> 00:10:13,650
Hey, you, there.
Shake a leg.

195
00:10:13,726 --> 00:10:15,785
We ain't got all day, you...

196
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:22,259
You can take as long
as you want, Billy.

197
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,532
Just say the word,
and you got all day.

198
00:10:25,605 --> 00:10:26,697
I beg your pardon?

199
00:10:26,773 --> 00:10:29,207
You ain't gonna get
a quarrel outta us.

200
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:31,903
See?
He dropped his gun.

201
00:10:32,845 --> 00:10:36,372
Does this stagecoach
go to Bloodshy, please?

202
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:38,349
You bet your sweet life
it does.

203
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:40,283
Anyplace you say.

204
00:10:40,353 --> 00:10:42,583
Bloodshy, Carson City,
Timbuktu.

205
00:10:42,655 --> 00:10:45,488
You name it,
and that's where we're goin'.

206
00:10:45,558 --> 00:10:47,458
We got nothin' but time.

207
00:10:47,527 --> 00:10:50,325
There ain't no passengers
to bother ya.

208
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:53,456
I'd be obliged if you could
store that for me, please.

209
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:54,625
Okay.

210
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:56,464
Thank you.
And that one.

211
00:10:56,536 --> 00:10:58,231
I'll be back in a jiffy.

212
00:10:58,304 --> 00:11:00,363
You just take your time.

213
00:11:01,107 --> 00:11:03,337
Wild Billy's talkin'
peculiar, ain't he?

214
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:05,343
Probably liquored up
from grievin'.

215
00:11:05,411 --> 00:11:07,743
Should we make a run for it?

216
00:11:07,814 --> 00:11:09,406
I don't know.

217
00:11:09,482 --> 00:11:11,973
He probably got 'em hid
under that coat.

218
00:11:16,255 --> 00:11:18,018
Right, driver.
We're all in now.

219
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:19,558
Yes, sir.

220
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,616
Hooo!
Ho!

221
00:11:21,694 --> 00:11:23,525
Let's go!

222
00:11:23,596 --> 00:11:25,723
Yah! Yah!
Come on, now!

223
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:29,697
People sure seem polite
around here.

224
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:32,101
They even call you
by your first name.

225
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:33,866
Even if it's the wrong one.

226
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,135
I've noticed.
‘Billy.’

227
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:37,437
I wonder why.

228
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,705
Hah hah! Come on, there!

229
00:11:39,846 --> 00:11:41,939
Hah! Get along, there!
Hah!

230
00:11:42,081 --> 00:11:43,241
Go on, now!

231
00:11:43,316 --> 00:11:46,877
Get along! Hah!

232
00:11:46,953 --> 00:11:50,184
Hey, get outta there!
Ho! Ho!

233
00:11:50,256 --> 00:11:51,689
Ho, there!

234
00:11:51,758 --> 00:11:55,660
Ho!
Ho, there!

235
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:56,956
Hey, you, there!

236
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,691
Get that thing
outta the way!

237
00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:00,932
Sure.

238
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,025
But first we got
a little business.

239
00:12:03,102 --> 00:12:04,399
Boys!

240
00:12:06,606 --> 00:12:09,006
We ain't carryin' gold.

241
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:11,236
No, but you got
a passenger we want.

242
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,437
- You want him?
- Good luck.

243
00:12:13,513 --> 00:12:14,673
Yeah.

244
00:12:15,715 --> 00:12:18,775
I had a feelin'
we might need this.

245
00:12:20,987 --> 00:12:23,114
You! Inside!

246
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:25,783
Come on out!
We got a surprise for ya!

247
00:12:29,962 --> 00:12:32,226
What's he doin' out here?!

248
00:12:32,298 --> 00:12:34,960
Heh. You kinda
took us by surprise.

249
00:12:35,034 --> 00:12:37,434
Another one of your jokes,
Billy? Ha ha ha!

250
00:12:43,443 --> 00:12:44,876
Guess this one's on us.

251
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:47,811
We come all the way out here
and find out it's you.

252
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,610
I don't know who you are
or who you think I am.

253
00:12:50,683 --> 00:12:54,141
But I do know
you shouldn't point that.

254
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,246
It's liable to go off
and hurt somebody.

255
00:12:58,758 --> 00:13:00,020
 Get down!

256
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:03,458
- Run for it!
- Out of my way!

257
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:04,996
Move it!
Run!

258
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:09,129
Let's go in the hills!

259
00:13:09,202 --> 00:13:11,932
Why, he's crazy!
Let's get outta here!

260
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,642
Wow!

261
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:23,647
That was awful!

262
00:13:23,716 --> 00:13:24,944
Did I tell ya?

263
00:13:25,017 --> 00:13:28,748
Our first day in the West,
and we've already been held up.

264
00:13:28,821 --> 00:13:31,619
We better take
this thing with us.

265
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:34,353
We don't want it to fall
into the wrong hands.

266
00:13:38,097 --> 00:13:40,429
I'm so tired,
I can hardly walk.

267
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,197
Don't worry. When we go through
the Badlands, you'll be running.

268
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,034
We don't run, we walk.
Head high, Brother Marcus.

269
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:50,507
By holding good thoughts and
relying on the power within us,

270
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:52,100
our burden shall be lifted.

271
00:13:52,178 --> 00:13:55,204
Do you remember that prophet
of old, Elijah?

272
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:57,374
A man of righteousness
and goodness.

273
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,281
He was sent
to his final victory,

274
00:13:59,385 --> 00:14:02,912
his eternal destination,
in a fiery chariot.

275
00:14:02,955 --> 00:14:04,479
Whoa! Whoa there!

276
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:08,291
Whoa! Whoa, boy!
Whoa! Whoa, there!

277
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:09,885
Look out!

278
00:14:11,564 --> 00:14:12,861
Are you all right?

279
00:14:12,932 --> 00:14:15,992
Yes. These critters seem
to have a mind of their own.

280
00:14:16,068 --> 00:14:18,935
What are you doing
in the middle of the road?

281
00:14:19,005 --> 00:14:21,064
We were just walking along.

282
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,371
Are you gonna stand there
babbling or help me?

283
00:14:24,443 --> 00:14:26,809
We'll help.
Give the lady a hand.

284
00:14:28,648 --> 00:14:30,616
The fiery chariot.

285
00:14:30,683 --> 00:14:32,583
I imagine
you could use a lift.

286
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:34,483
Thank you.
Where are you going?

287
00:14:34,554 --> 00:14:36,488
As far as Bloodshy.

288
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:38,148
So are we.

289
00:14:38,224 --> 00:14:39,953
First the fiery chariot,

290
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:42,460
and now she's taking us
to Bloodshy.

291
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:45,725
See? You don't have to run
if you listen to Brother Eli.

292
00:14:45,798 --> 00:14:46,856
There.

293
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:48,264
Thank you.

294
00:14:48,334 --> 00:14:50,495
Hey, I'm Jenny Willingham.

295
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,333
Are you a dance-hall girl?

296
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:53,429
Marcus.

297
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:55,337
No, I'm a schoolteacher.

298
00:14:55,408 --> 00:14:57,376
How do you do?
I'm Eli Bloodshy.

299
00:14:57,443 --> 00:14:58,501
We're missionaries.

300
00:14:58,611 --> 00:15:00,670
That's Roxanne,
and this is Marcus.

301
00:15:00,713 --> 00:15:03,113
- Bloodshy, huh?
- It was my father's town.

302
00:15:03,182 --> 00:15:06,345
He passed away, but I'm going
to collect my inheritance.

303
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:09,445
Now, am I just gonna
stand here or get that lift?

304
00:15:30,276 --> 00:15:32,471
‘Put me down,’ I said!
Put me down!

305
00:15:43,456 --> 00:15:45,924
Oh, Mansbridge.

306
00:15:45,992 --> 00:15:47,254
Field, sir.

307
00:15:47,326 --> 00:15:48,258
Oh, yeah.

308
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:50,557
What can I do for you,
Fieldbridge?

309
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,325
It's Mansfield, sir.

310
00:15:52,398 --> 00:15:53,387
Oh, yeah.

311
00:15:53,466 --> 00:15:56,560
Well, them English names
are all Greek to me.

312
00:15:59,005 --> 00:16:00,529
You wanna watch it there?

313
00:16:00,606 --> 00:16:04,235
I'll turn your overnight stay
into a life sentence.

314
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:08,508
You gotta keep your eye on 'em
so they don't fly the coop.

315
00:16:08,581 --> 00:16:12,039
We had a little fire in here
thanks to Mr. Wild Billy.

316
00:16:12,118 --> 00:16:15,849
One of these days, I'm gonna
put the cuffs on him for good.

317
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,523
If you don't mind, sir,

318
00:16:19,592 --> 00:16:21,992
I'm looking
for Mayor Ragsdale.

319
00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:23,426
Mr. Bloodshy's will.

320
00:16:23,496 --> 00:16:26,988
Well, if it has to do with law,
you came to the right place.

321
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:29,125
It's to be administered
by the mayor.

322
00:16:29,201 --> 00:16:30,998
Leave it to me, Mainstream.

323
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:49,915
Now, you remember
you're on your honor!

324
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:56,986
‘I, Jasper Bloodshy,
last will and testament,

325
00:16:57,063 --> 00:16:59,395
my entire inheritance...’

326
00:16:59,498 --> 00:17:00,465
It's a contest.

327
00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:01,431
It is?

328
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,831
No, it isn't.

329
00:17:02,902 --> 00:17:04,164
It isn't?

330
00:17:04,236 --> 00:17:06,864
Not when the other contestant
can't make it.

331
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:08,099
Why can't he make it?

332
00:17:08,174 --> 00:17:11,075
Because the poor sucker's
on his way...

333
00:17:13,212 --> 00:17:15,806
Sheriff, don't you have
anything better to do?

334
00:17:15,881 --> 00:17:16,813
No, not now.

335
00:17:16,882 --> 00:17:19,476
Go out and find Wild Billy.

336
00:17:19,552 --> 00:17:20,484
Wild Billy?

337
00:17:20,553 --> 00:17:22,817
Tell him it's official.
He's rich.

338
00:17:22,888 --> 00:17:25,322
Wild Billy?

339
00:17:25,391 --> 00:17:27,222
It's good news, Sheriff.

340
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:29,989
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Good news.

341
00:17:30,062 --> 00:17:32,121
Then maybe he won't
want a shoot-out.

342
00:17:32,198 --> 00:17:33,426
I'll tell him.

343
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:36,059
Very rich.

344
00:17:36,635 --> 00:17:38,899
Isn't it beautiful, children?

345
00:17:38,971 --> 00:17:41,599
All you can see for miles.

346
00:17:43,376 --> 00:17:45,344
 Look at that.

347
00:17:45,411 --> 00:17:47,276
Bloodshy.

348
00:17:47,346 --> 00:17:50,042
It's my name etched in wood.

349
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:55,346
So, where will you
be staying?

350
00:17:55,421 --> 00:17:56,911
How about the saloon?

351
00:17:56,989 --> 00:17:59,048
Children can't stay
at a saloon.

352
00:17:59,158 --> 00:18:01,422
Why not? We're used to
places like that.

353
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,928
And there's a lot
of souls to save there.

354
00:18:03,996 --> 00:18:06,191
I've made arrangements
at a boardinghouse.

355
00:18:06,265 --> 00:18:08,199
I'm sure
they'll have room for you.

356
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:11,168
- Thank you very much.
- A boardinghouse?

357
00:18:11,237 --> 00:18:14,070
That's not where all
the shooting and fighting is.

358
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,440
99.9% of all towns in the West
are peaceful little villages

359
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:20,274
where nothing ever happens.

360
00:18:20,346 --> 00:18:23,247
Get all that other stuff
out of your head, hmm?

361
00:18:32,057 --> 00:18:33,786
Wow!

362
00:18:37,329 --> 00:18:38,660
Hah!

363
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:40,528
Hah!

364
00:19:13,732 --> 00:19:15,427
Whoa!

365
00:19:15,501 --> 00:19:17,298
I think we're here.

366
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:18,961
I don't believe it.

367
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:22,105
Ohh!

368
00:19:22,174 --> 00:19:23,539
[Coughing]

369
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:25,042
Oh, uh, sorry.

370
00:19:26,078 --> 00:19:27,841
Mr. Bloodshy,
are you all right?

371
00:19:27,913 --> 00:19:28,845
I think so, yes.

372
00:19:28,914 --> 00:19:29,846
Step aside!

373
00:19:29,915 --> 00:19:30,939
Oh!

374
00:19:31,016 --> 00:19:32,984
Ooh!

375
00:19:52,571 --> 00:19:54,129
Why, you...

376
00:19:54,206 --> 00:19:55,730
Sorry.

377
00:19:58,244 --> 00:20:00,439
Stop, thief!

378
00:20:00,513 --> 00:20:01,673
Get that varmint!

379
00:20:01,747 --> 00:20:04,181
- Where is he?!
- I didn't see him.

380
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,444
There he goes.

381
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,620
Get down!
Get down!

382
00:20:12,658 --> 00:20:15,092
You sidewinder!

383
00:20:24,803 --> 00:20:26,862
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

384
00:20:26,939 --> 00:20:28,668
Just a minute!
Just a minute!

385
00:20:28,741 --> 00:20:29,833
Do you mind?

386
00:20:32,111 --> 00:20:33,305
Thank you.

387
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:35,677
This is no way
to solve a problem.

388
00:20:35,748 --> 00:20:37,409
If a man is guilty
of a crime,

389
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:39,610
he should be judged
in a court of law,

390
00:20:39,685 --> 00:20:42,552
not by mob rule and violence.

391
00:20:45,524 --> 00:20:48,220
- Yeah, sure.
- Whatever you say.

392
00:20:48,294 --> 00:20:50,057
Just because
these men are mean,

393
00:20:50,129 --> 00:20:52,597
it doesn't mean
they won't listen to reason.

394
00:20:52,665 --> 00:20:55,293
Now, can you tell me
where the sheriff is?

395
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:56,891
I've got something for him.

396
00:20:56,969 --> 00:20:58,698
There he goes again!

397
00:20:58,804 --> 00:21:00,965
He's gone crazy!

398
00:21:01,974 --> 00:21:03,236
Outta my way!

399
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,505
Maybe we'll find him
in the saloon.

400
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,483
No, not we.
Me.

401
00:21:12,551 --> 00:21:15,111
You're off to the boardinghouse
with Miss Willingham.

402
00:21:15,187 --> 00:21:17,883
- Aw, Eli.
- Jenny.

403
00:21:17,957 --> 00:21:20,517
Besides,
you two could use a nap.

404
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:21,855
Good idea.

405
00:21:21,927 --> 00:21:24,054
Eli, we're too old
to take a nap!

406
00:21:24,129 --> 00:21:26,791
Give us a break!

407
00:21:28,334 --> 00:21:29,961
Yo!
Get up here!

408
00:21:30,035 --> 00:21:31,502
Whoo-hoo!

409
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:35,700
Yeah, me and Wild Billy
are just like that.

410
00:21:35,774 --> 00:21:37,537
Leastways, we're gonna be.

411
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:40,443
I got some news
that's gonna keep him in booze,

412
00:21:40,512 --> 00:21:42,844
babes, and...

413
00:21:45,784 --> 00:21:46,751
Sheriff?

414
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:49,686
- Billy, don't shoot!
- Pardon?

415
00:21:49,755 --> 00:21:52,417
I got good news!
We got the will.

416
00:21:52,491 --> 00:21:54,686
I seen it myself
in black and white.

417
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,591
I cross my heart
and hope to die.

418
00:21:56,662 --> 00:21:57,594
Oh, Billy, no.

419
00:21:57,663 --> 00:21:59,597
Let's just check
that cannon, okay?

420
00:21:59,698 --> 00:22:01,757
Thank you very much.

421
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,928
One of man's
most destructive weapons.

422
00:22:05,004 --> 00:22:07,131
What are you doin'
in that crazy suit?

423
00:22:07,206 --> 00:22:09,766
That's all right.
You can wear what you want.

424
00:22:09,842 --> 00:22:11,241
You can do what you want.

425
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,471
You own the town,
the land, the money,

426
00:22:13,545 --> 00:22:15,638
the land as far
as the eye can see.

427
00:22:15,714 --> 00:22:17,147
You're rich, Billy!
Rich!

428
00:22:17,216 --> 00:22:19,411
It's almost too good
to be true.

429
00:22:19,485 --> 00:22:21,544
I thought that'd soften you up.

430
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,850
Don't forget,
I'm the one who told you.

431
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:36,199
Sheriff,
I think I know those men.

432
00:22:36,268 --> 00:22:38,998
Well, I think it's time
for a round of drinks.

433
00:22:39,071 --> 00:22:40,129
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

434
00:22:40,205 --> 00:22:41,263
What'll you have?

435
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,637
A cup of tea, please.

436
00:22:46,045 --> 00:22:48,639
- I've sent for the tea.
- Thank you very much.

437
00:22:48,714 --> 00:22:51,148
- BILLY: Yeeeee-ha!

438
00:22:51,216 --> 00:22:52,979
Outta my way, you varmint!

439
00:22:53,052 --> 00:22:56,351
If you wasn't right here,
I'd swear that sounds like you.

440
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:05,724
Yeeeee-hoooo!

441
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:07,322
Now there's two of 'em!

442
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:08,661
Liven it up! Yeah!

443
00:23:08,734 --> 00:23:11,567
Yeeeeee-hooooo!

444
00:23:13,505 --> 00:23:16,269
He looks just like
a real gunfighter.

445
00:23:16,341 --> 00:23:19,276
I don't think we know him
as well as we thought.

446
00:23:20,312 --> 00:23:22,780
Yeah! Yeah!
Hah!

447
00:23:22,848 --> 00:23:25,749
This saloon is deader
than Boot Hill!

448
00:23:25,818 --> 00:23:28,013
Party needs livenin' up.

449
00:23:32,925 --> 00:23:35,223
That's Eli over there.

450
00:23:45,704 --> 00:23:47,467
Twins?

451
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:50,599
Twin brothers!
Isn't that wonderful?

452
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,780
What's this?

453
00:24:05,924 --> 00:24:07,983
I thought I shot out
that mirror!

454
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,789
Don't fire.
No.

455
00:24:11,096 --> 00:24:13,792
Holy smoke.
The mirror's talkin' to me.

456
00:24:13,866 --> 00:24:15,128
I'm not a mirror.
No.

457
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,225
I don't like this.

458
00:24:17,302 --> 00:24:18,826
How come there's two of me?

459
00:24:18,904 --> 00:24:21,566
I said, ‘How come
there's two of me?’

460
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,336
Hold it, Billy.
There ain't two of you.

461
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:27,640
There's one of each.
Brothers, spittin' images.

462
00:24:27,713 --> 00:24:29,442
Brothers?

463
00:24:29,515 --> 00:24:31,847
Oh, isn't that marvelous?

464
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:33,942
I'm overjoyed.

465
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:36,385
Well, I don't need
no spittin' image!

466
00:24:36,455 --> 00:24:37,888
Hold it, Billy!
Hold it!

467
00:24:37,956 --> 00:24:40,015
Now, we got us
a brand-new will.

468
00:24:40,092 --> 00:24:43,027
Now, it mentions the fact
that you got a brother,

469
00:24:43,095 --> 00:24:46,622
but it don't say nothin'
about him bein' a twin.

470
00:24:46,698 --> 00:24:50,532
Well, I don't need no brother,
nor no spittin' twin!

471
00:24:50,602 --> 00:24:52,832
Like it or not,
want it or not,

472
00:24:52,905 --> 00:24:55,237
need it or not,
you got him!

473
00:24:55,307 --> 00:24:57,639
Just whose side are you on,
Mayor?

474
00:24:57,709 --> 00:24:59,233
Oh, Mayor Ragsdale?

475
00:24:59,311 --> 00:25:01,609
- Uh, yes.
- Eli Bloodshy, sir.

476
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,046
I've got a letter
asking me to look you up

477
00:25:04,116 --> 00:25:05,777
regarding my inheritance.

478
00:25:05,851 --> 00:25:08,945
Your inheritance?
Now, not so fast.

479
00:25:09,021 --> 00:25:11,854
Now, how do we know
he's a real Bloodshy?

480
00:25:11,924 --> 00:25:14,290
You talk funny,
like a foreigner.

481
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:16,384
Well, I've got
my birth certificate.

482
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:19,726
I've got my license to
drive a cart in Philadelphia.

483
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:24,235
And I'm expecting my preaching
permit any day now.

484
00:25:24,303 --> 00:25:27,272
Oh, Lordy, it ain't bad enough
I got me a brother.

485
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:28,806
He's a tambourine whacker!

486
00:25:31,476 --> 00:25:32,738
Yeah. Yeah.

487
00:25:32,811 --> 00:25:34,540
Well, Eli.

488
00:25:34,613 --> 00:25:35,545
Eli, sir.

489
00:25:35,614 --> 00:25:36,774
Yes, Eli.

490
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:39,477
Yes, we do have an inheritance,

491
00:25:39,551 --> 00:25:44,181
but there's
a little contest involved.

492
00:25:44,256 --> 00:25:45,883
What kind of a contest?

493
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:47,255
Between the two of you.

494
00:25:47,326 --> 00:25:49,817
It's spelled out
right in here.

495
00:25:49,895 --> 00:25:51,328
Yes, in detail.

496
00:25:51,396 --> 00:25:53,489
Uh, yes.
There it is.

497
00:25:53,565 --> 00:25:55,294
‘Winner take all.’

498
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:57,062
Between him and me?

499
00:25:57,135 --> 00:25:58,227
Ha!

500
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:01,932
What does it consist of?

501
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:04,100
Oh, just a little race.

502
00:26:04,176 --> 00:26:06,576
[Laughing] Nothin' to be
worried about.

503
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:07,976
You come on now, Eli.

504
00:26:08,046 --> 00:26:10,742
Let me show you the town
that your daddy built.

505
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,841
I'll see you later, Billy.

506
00:26:12,918 --> 00:26:14,852
A little race, huh?

507
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,718
On the Bloody Bloodshy Trail.

508
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:19,552
Well, if'n I was you boys,

509
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:22,423
I'd get a few bets
down in the big city.

510
00:26:22,494 --> 00:26:25,657
That a way, whilst I'm cleanin'
up on the psalm singer,

511
00:26:25,731 --> 00:26:27,858
you boys
can be cleanin' out Reno!

512
00:26:27,933 --> 00:26:30,401
- Yooooo-hooooo!

513
00:26:33,605 --> 00:26:35,664
That's the Bloodshy
Savings Bank.

514
00:26:35,741 --> 00:26:37,971
Hasn't been open
since the last robbery.

515
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:40,511
There's not much money
in this town, parson.

516
00:26:40,579 --> 00:26:43,047
I thought my father
had considerable wealth.

517
00:26:43,115 --> 00:26:45,743
Yes. It's all safe
and sound in my vault there.

518
00:26:45,817 --> 00:26:47,751
Don't you worry
about a thing, son.

519
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:50,049
The lunchroom's shot, too?

520
00:26:50,122 --> 00:26:53,922
People around here seem to get
what they need in the saloon.

521
00:26:55,193 --> 00:26:56,888
So I see.

522
00:26:56,962 --> 00:26:58,987
It's the West, you see, son?

523
00:26:59,097 --> 00:27:00,724
It's the wild, wild West.

524
00:27:00,766 --> 00:27:02,393
Hold it.
He's here.

525
00:27:02,467 --> 00:27:03,399
Who?

526
00:27:03,468 --> 00:27:05,834
He is.
Rattlesnake.

527
00:27:05,904 --> 00:27:08,737
But don't worry.
It's gonna be all right.

528
00:27:08,807 --> 00:27:10,468
I got the edge on him.

529
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:12,169
You do?
Why?

530
00:27:12,244 --> 00:27:13,939
Because he's here,

531
00:27:14,012 --> 00:27:16,310
and he knows I know
he's here.

532
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:19,976
But he doesn't know I know
he knows I know he's here,

533
00:27:20,052 --> 00:27:21,485
but I know.

534
00:27:21,553 --> 00:27:24,317
So I got the edge.

535
00:27:25,857 --> 00:27:29,691
Let's leave this
up to the sheriff, son.

536
00:27:38,403 --> 00:27:40,530
You're here.
I know you're here.

537
00:27:40,605 --> 00:27:42,300
Yeah, I'm here, all right.

538
00:27:42,374 --> 00:27:45,275
My sister says
you insulted her.

539
00:27:45,344 --> 00:27:48,677
No man insults my sister
and stays alive.

540
00:27:48,747 --> 00:27:51,147
Insulted her?
I asked her to marry me.

541
00:27:51,216 --> 00:27:53,184
So, she was right.

542
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:55,776
Get ready to slap leather.

543
00:27:55,854 --> 00:27:57,685
Then get ready
to bite the dust.

544
00:27:59,391 --> 00:28:02,224
You're fast, Denver,
but not that fast.

545
00:28:02,294 --> 00:28:04,194
Nobody's that fast.

546
00:28:04,262 --> 00:28:07,754
I didn't get to be the sheriff
of Bloodshy for being slow.

547
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:11,030
Draw and I'll tattoo
your name all over that sheet.

548
00:28:13,438 --> 00:28:16,566
You draw and there'll be
another badge on Boot Hill.

549
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:18,973
We'll see about that.

550
00:28:19,044 --> 00:28:22,138
At the count of three.

551
00:28:45,971 --> 00:28:47,097
1.

552
00:28:47,172 --> 00:28:48,332
2.

553
00:28:56,381 --> 00:28:58,349
Aah! Oh!

554
00:29:01,186 --> 00:29:02,778
Whahh!

555
00:29:02,854 --> 00:29:04,788
Uh, uh!

556
00:29:04,856 --> 00:29:06,847
It seems what
hasn't been burnt down

557
00:29:06,925 --> 00:29:08,119
has been boarded up.

558
00:29:08,193 --> 00:29:09,717
I hope the church survived.

559
00:29:09,795 --> 00:29:12,787
No. The church burned down
about six months ago.

560
00:29:12,864 --> 00:29:14,388
The church as well?

561
00:29:14,466 --> 00:29:16,525
Perhaps I can speak
to your minister.

562
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:20,037
Well, yeah. You probably passed
him on the way into town.

563
00:29:20,105 --> 00:29:22,096
All we passed
was a little cemetery.

564
00:29:22,174 --> 00:29:26,110
That great big gray tombstone?
That was him.

565
00:29:26,178 --> 00:29:28,339
You beginning
to get the picture, boy?

566
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:31,177
It's the classic picture
of a town on its knees.

567
00:29:31,249 --> 00:29:33,080
Yes, exactly.
Exactly.

568
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:36,018
Even if you do win that race,
look around you here.

569
00:29:36,088 --> 00:29:38,147
- What have you got?
- What have I got?

570
00:29:38,223 --> 00:29:41,454
I've got the most marvelous
opportunity a man could have.

571
00:29:41,526 --> 00:29:45,519
Thank you for the most
inspiring walk of my life.

572
00:29:45,597 --> 00:29:47,497
What?

573
00:29:47,566 --> 00:29:48,794
Jenny?

574
00:29:48,867 --> 00:29:50,664
In here.

575
00:29:50,735 --> 00:29:53,898
Jenny, fate took us by the hand
when it led us out here.

576
00:29:53,972 --> 00:29:56,805
Everywhere you turn,
there's a golden opportunity.

577
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:58,103
What are you doing?

578
00:29:58,176 --> 00:30:00,269
Packing.
It goes along with leaving.

579
00:30:00,345 --> 00:30:02,006
Which is what
I'm going to do.

580
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,241
But there's a real job
to be done here.

581
00:30:04,316 --> 00:30:07,615
What job? The school
burnt down six months ago.

582
00:30:07,686 --> 00:30:09,745
All the more reason
we're needed.

583
00:30:09,821 --> 00:30:11,345
To start a fire department?

584
00:30:11,423 --> 00:30:14,085
To build a new church,
to build a new school,

585
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,218
to lift this town
to its feet, Jenny.

586
00:30:16,294 --> 00:30:18,728
I believe that destiny
has spoken to us.

587
00:30:18,797 --> 00:30:21,789
Did destiny tell you where
the money was coming from?

588
00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:24,097
- My inheritance.
- What about the race?

589
00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:26,467
The race?
You've heard about that?

590
00:30:26,538 --> 00:30:29,166
It's all over town.
The kids told me.

591
00:30:29,241 --> 00:30:31,607
Considering the life
my brother's leading,

592
00:30:31,676 --> 00:30:33,769
I'll be taking
unfair advantage.

593
00:30:33,845 --> 00:30:37,440
You don't think you stand
a chance to win, do you?

594
00:30:37,516 --> 00:30:39,848
When you're a missionary
in Philadelphia,

595
00:30:39,918 --> 00:30:41,749
you get to be fast on your feet.

596
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,219
How are you in the water?

597
00:30:43,288 --> 00:30:46,519
When was the last time
you shot the rapids?

598
00:30:46,591 --> 00:30:49,788
And how about the six-up team?
Have you driven one?

599
00:30:49,861 --> 00:30:52,728
- I've never driven one.
- Then there's the mountain.

600
00:30:52,797 --> 00:30:55,265
Have you ever climbed
straight up 2,000 feet

601
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:58,200
with razor-sharp rocks
and death at every turn?

602
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,898
Is that what you think
this race is all about?

603
00:31:00,972 --> 00:31:01,996
That's it exactly.

604
00:31:02,073 --> 00:31:05,236
Half of the people are betting
you won't come out alive.

605
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,402
That's ridiculous.

606
00:31:06,478 --> 00:31:10,209
You've been listening to
rumors and a couple of kids.

607
00:31:10,282 --> 00:31:12,750
Mayor Ragsdale assures me
it's nothing more

608
00:31:12,817 --> 00:31:15,217
than a plain, simple,
ordinary race.

609
00:31:15,287 --> 00:31:17,414
You don't believe him,
do you?

610
00:31:17,489 --> 00:31:20,014
Of course. He's a fine,
upstanding gentleman.

611
00:31:20,091 --> 00:31:21,422
I like that.

612
00:31:21,493 --> 00:31:24,018
He's a civic dignitary,
you know.

613
00:31:24,095 --> 00:31:26,086
But...

614
00:31:26,164 --> 00:31:27,791
Oh.

615
00:31:29,868 --> 00:31:31,699
He must not finish
that race,

616
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:34,238
but you gotta make it
look like an accident.

617
00:31:34,306 --> 00:31:36,467
I don't know what
you're head-up about.

618
00:31:36,541 --> 00:31:39,533
Ain't no way that city dude
can make that course.

619
00:31:39,611 --> 00:31:43,138
Well, there's too much
at stake to take any chances.

620
00:31:43,215 --> 00:31:46,116
There's something about him
that makes me nervous.

621
00:31:46,184 --> 00:31:49,915
Do you boys think that
you can handle it this time?

622
00:31:50,689 --> 00:31:52,350
Quit your worrying, Ragsdale.

623
00:31:52,424 --> 00:31:55,791
Takin' care of an hombre like
Eli is our meat and potatoes.

624
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:59,796
Good. I'll have some gravy
for you later.

625
00:32:05,704 --> 00:32:07,797
Dinner in a moment, sir.

626
00:32:07,872 --> 00:32:12,036
Try servin' it up here,
you overpaid import!

627
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,270
And close your mouth,

628
00:32:13,345 --> 00:32:15,973
less'n you're aimin'
to catch flies.

629
00:32:16,047 --> 00:32:19,710
If I may, sir,
what are you doing up there?

630
00:32:19,784 --> 00:32:22,344
I'm spyin' on you,
Mansfield,

631
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,480
to make sure
you delivered the will.

632
00:32:25,557 --> 00:32:28,958
Perhaps you were able
to get a glimpse of Master Eli.

633
00:32:29,027 --> 00:32:31,791
I would have if'n
you hadn't let me climb up here

634
00:32:31,863 --> 00:32:33,592
without my spyglass.

635
00:32:33,665 --> 00:32:35,997
Begging your pardon,
but I wasn't here.

636
00:32:36,067 --> 00:32:39,366
That's no excuse,
you lint-headed limey!

637
00:32:39,437 --> 00:32:42,838
Now look alive!
I'm comin' down!

638
00:32:42,907 --> 00:32:44,568
Very good, sir.

639
00:32:46,344 --> 00:32:48,073
Ooh! Ooh!

640
00:32:50,048 --> 00:32:51,515
Ooh! Ooh!

641
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:53,278
Are you quite
all right, sir?

642
00:32:54,853 --> 00:32:57,185
Now I've had it with you,
Mansfield.

643
00:32:57,255 --> 00:32:58,813
You missed me again,

644
00:32:58,923 --> 00:33:01,687
just like your broken-down neck
did at the gorge.

645
00:33:01,726 --> 00:33:03,489
Accidentally,
I assure you, sir.

646
00:33:03,561 --> 00:33:04,550
Bourgeois.

647
00:33:04,629 --> 00:33:06,824
If'n you don't kill me
by missin' me,

648
00:33:06,898 --> 00:33:09,890
you're gonna get me
with your poison cookin'.

649
00:33:09,968 --> 00:33:11,731
Well, the stage
is now set, sir,

650
00:33:11,803 --> 00:33:14,670
and we patiently await
the opening curtain.

651
00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:16,934
Don't give me
that highfalutin lingo,

652
00:33:17,008 --> 00:33:18,805
you shoddy Shakespeare!

653
00:33:18,877 --> 00:33:20,902
Now, what's my boy look like?

654
00:33:20,979 --> 00:33:22,105
As you would say,

655
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,648
‘The spittin' image
of your other son,’ sir.

656
00:33:24,716 --> 00:33:26,013
Totin' guns, was he?

657
00:33:26,084 --> 00:33:29,349
Yes. Rather a large
rapid-firing one, sir.

658
00:33:29,421 --> 00:33:32,015
Another fightin' fool.
Oh, great glory.

659
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:35,526
I can see a real battle
shapin' up, Mansfield.

660
00:33:35,593 --> 00:33:37,254
Under your watchful eye,

661
00:33:37,329 --> 00:33:39,991
I'm sure it will be
a marvelous contest.

662
00:33:40,065 --> 00:33:41,259
Do sit down, sir.

663
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:42,664
Oh, thank you kindly.

664
00:33:42,734 --> 00:33:44,599
Ah! Ooh!

665
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,328
With you around, Mansfield,

666
00:33:47,405 --> 00:33:50,397
my watchful eye may be
the only thing left in my body

667
00:33:50,475 --> 00:33:53,137
that ain't broke,
battered, or busted.

668
00:33:53,712 --> 00:33:55,043
Revival meeting, ma'am.

669
00:33:55,113 --> 00:33:56,171
A pamphlet, sir?

670
00:33:56,247 --> 00:33:59,273
Singin', preachin',
and free soup?

671
00:33:59,384 --> 00:34:01,477
- It's homemade.
- Yes.

672
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,386
Free booze, and you might
get yourself a crowd.

673
00:34:04,456 --> 00:34:06,253
But free soup?
[Laughing]

674
00:34:06,324 --> 00:34:08,315
Maybe some of the farmers
will come.

675
00:34:08,393 --> 00:34:11,089
I sure hope someone does.

676
00:34:11,162 --> 00:34:13,630
I hope those gunfighters
don't come.

677
00:34:13,698 --> 00:34:15,461
I don't care
what Ragsdale says.

678
00:34:15,533 --> 00:34:16,727
If I had my way,

679
00:34:16,801 --> 00:34:19,429
that preacher wouldn't make it
to the starting line.

680
00:34:19,504 --> 00:34:20,528
They mean Eli.

681
00:34:20,605 --> 00:34:22,664
He'd never believe that.

682
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:25,539
He's always looking
at the good side of people.

683
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:27,976
But while he's looking
at their good side,

684
00:34:28,046 --> 00:34:29,980
their bad side's
gonna finish him.

685
00:34:30,048 --> 00:34:32,710
What we oughta do
is try to help protect him.

686
00:34:32,784 --> 00:34:33,773
Look!

687
00:34:36,888 --> 00:34:38,617
Five paces,
we turn and shoot.

688
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:39,952
Right.

689
00:34:40,925 --> 00:34:42,051
What about it?

690
00:34:42,127 --> 00:34:44,186
That's a way
to help protect him.

691
00:34:44,262 --> 00:34:45,194
How?

692
00:34:45,263 --> 00:34:46,958
Just wait.

693
00:34:47,031 --> 00:34:48,555
You ready?

694
00:34:48,633 --> 00:34:50,692
I'm ready.
You ready?

695
00:34:50,769 --> 00:34:52,100
I'm ready.
You ready?

696
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:56,367
I said I was ready.
You gonna count, count.

697
00:34:56,941 --> 00:34:59,466
All right.
I'm gonna count now.

698
00:35:01,746 --> 00:35:02,940
Well, count!

699
00:35:04,849 --> 00:35:06,817
1.

700
00:35:06,885 --> 00:35:08,352
2.

701
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,285
3.

702
00:35:10,355 --> 00:35:11,652
4.

703
00:35:11,723 --> 00:35:12,712
5!

704
00:35:16,194 --> 00:35:17,388
Whhaaahhh!

705
00:35:33,812 --> 00:35:36,303
Guns?!
What are you doing?!

706
00:35:36,381 --> 00:35:39,509
Eli needs our help.
They're gonna get him.

707
00:35:39,584 --> 00:35:42,576
I don't care. You have
no business playing with guns.

708
00:35:42,654 --> 00:35:45,350
- You want me to help unload it?
- Absolutely not.

709
00:35:45,423 --> 00:35:47,891
Finish delivering
those pamphlets. Now move.

710
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:51,190
You better be careful, Jenny.
The shotgun's still loaded.

711
00:35:51,262 --> 00:35:54,459
Don't you worry about me.
Now, get a move on.

712
00:35:54,532 --> 00:35:56,932
- All right.
- Yes'm.

713
00:36:07,612 --> 00:36:09,273
-  Ah!
- Whoa!

714
00:36:09,347 --> 00:36:10,473
Ow! Oh!

715
00:36:14,419 --> 00:36:16,683
Who... who did...

716
00:36:16,754 --> 00:36:20,155
You! You.

717
00:36:20,225 --> 00:36:22,386
You almost killed me!

718
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,859
Eli?

719
00:36:23,928 --> 00:36:25,555
Are you crazy?

720
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,655
What are you doing
shooting guns?

721
00:36:27,732 --> 00:36:29,859
You don't understand.
Eli, I wasn't...

722
00:36:29,934 --> 00:36:31,526
Well, if you wasn't,
who was?

723
00:36:31,603 --> 00:36:33,036
The children.

724
00:36:33,104 --> 00:36:34,867
Jenny,
don't blame the children.

725
00:36:34,939 --> 00:36:37,305
It's bad enough
to twist the truth, Jenny.

726
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:41,573
But to blame two innocent
children for this.

727
00:36:41,646 --> 00:36:42,772
I'm shocked.

728
00:36:42,847 --> 00:36:44,644
You... you...

729
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:49,487
You wait and see.

730
00:36:49,554 --> 00:36:51,988
When it comes
to spottin' my son,

731
00:36:52,056 --> 00:36:56,220
this has to be
the perfect spot, Mansfield.

732
00:36:57,228 --> 00:36:59,093
Innocent children.

733
00:36:59,197 --> 00:37:01,392
Innocent children.

734
00:37:02,567 --> 00:37:04,694
Ah! Ohh!

735
00:37:37,702 --> 00:37:39,465
Hmm!

736
00:38:53,544 --> 00:38:55,341
All right, Rattlesnake!

737
00:38:55,413 --> 00:38:57,404
None of your tricks
this time!

738
00:38:57,482 --> 00:39:00,383
On the count of three, draw!

739
00:39:00,485 --> 00:39:03,818
Countin' three
is fair by me.

740
00:39:03,855 --> 00:39:05,220
So long, Denver.

741
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,418
1.

742
00:39:12,397 --> 00:39:14,024
2.

743
00:39:19,737 --> 00:39:20,897
3.

744
00:39:30,515 --> 00:39:32,813
- We're gonna be late.
- Jenny, let's go.

745
00:39:32,884 --> 00:39:35,682
What's wrong, Jenny?

746
00:39:35,753 --> 00:39:36,777
Aren't you going?

747
00:39:36,854 --> 00:39:38,481
No, I don't think I will.

748
00:39:38,556 --> 00:39:41,992
- Eli needs us, Jenny.
- It's his first revival meeting.

749
00:39:46,297 --> 00:39:48,891
You'd do anything for him,
wouldn't you?

750
00:39:48,966 --> 00:39:51,992
Sure. He's done everything
for us.

751
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,732
Maybe even more than a father
would have done.

752
00:39:56,574 --> 00:39:58,940
You'd like to have a father,
wouldn't you?

753
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:01,774
More than anything else
in the whole world.

754
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:09,251
Well, maybe I'll bring
some soup down later on.

755
00:40:10,521 --> 00:40:11,886
Come on.

756
00:40:20,665 --> 00:40:22,929
No! I tell you,
there is hope!

757
00:40:23,034 --> 00:40:24,729
As Solomon
told ancient Israel,

758
00:40:24,802 --> 00:40:27,270
the house of the wicked
shall be overthrown,

759
00:40:27,338 --> 00:40:30,136
but the tabernacle
of the upright shall flourish.

760
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:33,609
A real battler?
You nincompoop!

761
00:40:33,678 --> 00:40:36,772
My son's a psalm singer!
Yoooo!

762
00:40:36,848 --> 00:40:38,281
Mr. Bloodshy.

763
00:40:38,349 --> 00:40:40,840
You better get out
while the gettin's good.

764
00:40:40,918 --> 00:40:43,682
The last feller who came here
talkin' tabernacles

765
00:40:43,755 --> 00:40:45,086
went out feet first.

766
00:40:45,156 --> 00:40:47,056
- You remember that.
- Yeah.

767
00:40:47,125 --> 00:40:49,650
But running away
has never been the solution,

768
00:40:49,727 --> 00:40:52,719
not when there are kind,
decent, peaceful people here

769
00:40:52,797 --> 00:40:56,426
who want to live in a community
where there's love and goodness.

770
00:40:56,501 --> 00:40:59,664
Looks like his brother
and talks like his mother.

771
00:40:59,771 --> 00:41:02,569
That poor milksop
stands as much chance out here

772
00:41:02,607 --> 00:41:05,474
as a snowflake
in the Sahara.

773
00:41:05,543 --> 00:41:07,977
What about my father?
Rest his soul.

774
00:41:08,045 --> 00:41:09,910
He practically
built this town.

775
00:41:09,981 --> 00:41:11,380
Practically?!

776
00:41:11,449 --> 00:41:15,351
I cleared timber,
drove nails, dug ditches!

777
00:41:15,419 --> 00:41:18,946
What am I telling you for?
You English sissy!

778
00:41:19,023 --> 00:41:22,015
But then he just sat around,
let it all turn sour,

779
00:41:22,093 --> 00:41:23,924
let it fall
into the wrong hands.

780
00:41:23,995 --> 00:41:26,429
Now it's a town of gamblin',
gunfightin',

781
00:41:26,497 --> 00:41:28,158
hard drinkin',
and fast women.

782
00:41:28,232 --> 00:41:30,291
Sounds pretty good to me.

783
00:41:31,969 --> 00:41:33,960
But if a town changed
for the worse,

784
00:41:34,038 --> 00:41:35,938
it could change for the better.

785
00:41:36,007 --> 00:41:39,238
All it needs is faith,
courage, and conviction.

786
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:41,005
I'm ready to stay right here

787
00:41:41,078 --> 00:41:43,945
and help you fight
to get this town back again.

788
00:41:44,015 --> 00:41:47,473
Well, I guess he does have
a smidgen of spunk after all,

789
00:41:47,552 --> 00:41:49,315
for a prune picker.

790
00:41:49,387 --> 00:41:50,911
- Mr. Bloodshy!
- Yeah? Ooh.

791
00:41:50,988 --> 00:41:52,888
I'm afraid
you won't be here long.

792
00:41:52,957 --> 00:41:55,289
You ain't gonna finish
that race.

793
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,291
You know why?

794
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,988
Because there isn't
going to be any silly race.

795
00:41:59,096 --> 00:42:01,428
What's he mean, no race?

796
00:42:01,465 --> 00:42:05,231
If’n he cancels my race,
I'll cancel him!

797
00:42:05,303 --> 00:42:08,431
I'm going across the street now
and talk to my brother.

798
00:42:08,506 --> 00:42:11,100
We'll split this inheritance
and use the money

799
00:42:11,175 --> 00:42:14,474
to make this a town
worth living in.

800
00:42:14,545 --> 00:42:16,479
Behind those guns of his,

801
00:42:16,547 --> 00:42:18,742
there's a fine,
decent human being.

802
00:42:18,816 --> 00:42:20,078
[Laughter]

803
00:42:20,151 --> 00:42:23,587
Mr. Bloodshy, do you really
believe all that?

804
00:42:23,654 --> 00:42:25,679
I certainly do.
Yes.

805
00:42:25,756 --> 00:42:28,350
Well, you're as crazy
as a coot.

806
00:42:28,426 --> 00:42:31,657
He's as crazy as two coots.

807
00:42:31,729 --> 00:42:34,721
Marcus will spread the word.

808
00:42:34,799 --> 00:42:37,962
The whole town will be out there
with love and kindness

809
00:42:38,035 --> 00:42:39,127
in their hearts.

810
00:42:39,203 --> 00:42:41,000
Roxanne, ring those bells.

811
00:42:43,574 --> 00:42:46,099
I've heared enough,
Mansfield.

812
00:42:46,177 --> 00:42:49,078
Now I don't have to hear
anymore.

813
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:04,024
<i>% % Oh, come to the church
in the nave% %</i>

814
00:43:21,045 --> 00:43:26,415
<i>% % Oh, come to the church
in the nave% %</i>

815
00:43:26,484 --> 00:43:30,750
<i>% % No spot is so dear
to my child% %</i>

816
00:43:30,821 --> 00:43:32,584
Brother Billy, may I...

817
00:43:36,661 --> 00:43:38,424
Brother Billy,
may I suggest...

818
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,828
Brother Billy, may I suggest
we put aside this contest

819
00:43:45,903 --> 00:43:47,427
and join our hands together

820
00:43:47,505 --> 00:43:49,439
for the benefit
of the community?

821
00:43:49,507 --> 00:43:50,735
You know what I mean?

822
00:43:50,808 --> 00:43:53,402
Yeah.
You're a-feared to race me.

823
00:43:53,477 --> 00:43:55,911
Certainly not,
but I think it's silly

824
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,505
for two grown men
to compete with each other.

825
00:43:58,616 --> 00:44:01,517
Now, if'n you don't run
in that race tomorrow,

826
00:44:01,552 --> 00:44:04,419
you're nothin' more
than I thought you was.

827
00:44:04,488 --> 00:44:08,015
A yellow-bellied, lily-livered
coward from the city.

828
00:44:08,092 --> 00:44:10,117
Now you get outta here

829
00:44:10,194 --> 00:44:13,652
afore I'm obliged
to blow your brains out.

830
00:44:13,731 --> 00:44:15,164
[Singing continues]

831
00:44:15,232 --> 00:44:17,632
But we still don't
have this settled.

832
00:44:17,702 --> 00:44:21,160
And I'm not leaving here
until we do.

833
00:44:21,238 --> 00:44:23,536
Oh, you're not, huh?

834
00:44:23,607 --> 00:44:24,801
No.

835
00:44:29,981 --> 00:44:33,007
You ought to be more careful
with that gun.

836
00:44:35,019 --> 00:44:37,715
Say good night
to Brother Eli.

837
00:44:37,788 --> 00:44:40,120
ALL:
Good night, Brother Eli!

838
00:44:52,269 --> 00:44:54,328
Oh, Eli.

839
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:03,471
We'll see you at the race
tomorrow, Brother Eli.

840
00:45:04,148 --> 00:45:07,049
That is, if you can get
your creakin' carcass

841
00:45:07,118 --> 00:45:08,676
to the startin' line.

842
00:45:08,753 --> 00:45:09,742
Whoo-hoo!

843
00:45:12,156 --> 00:45:15,421
Hey, wait a minute!
You can't get away with that!

844
00:45:15,493 --> 00:45:16,425
Marcus, stop.

845
00:45:16,494 --> 00:45:18,485
Now you won't have to wash.

846
00:45:22,566 --> 00:45:25,535
When are you gonna realize
they don't want us here?

847
00:45:25,603 --> 00:45:27,537
But we are needed.

848
00:45:27,605 --> 00:45:29,334
Eli, they're against you.

849
00:45:29,407 --> 00:45:30,738
All of 'em are.

850
00:45:30,808 --> 00:45:31,832
Just a minute.

851
00:45:31,909 --> 00:45:34,537
You haven't lost faith,
have you?

852
00:45:34,612 --> 00:45:37,342
- Of course not.
- Not in you.

853
00:45:53,431 --> 00:45:57,925
Five mighty tests of courage,
skill, and strength.

854
00:45:58,002 --> 00:45:59,833
Startin' with
the iron donkeys,

855
00:45:59,904 --> 00:46:02,998
snortin' little piston-drivin'
steam engines,

856
00:46:03,074 --> 00:46:05,975
and endin' up
with the six-up teams.

857
00:46:06,043 --> 00:46:09,035
Wagons pulled
by six powerful horses.

858
00:46:09,113 --> 00:46:13,447
You're gonna see fierce,
spirited, untamed, wild-eyed...

859
00:46:13,517 --> 00:46:14,916
You lookin' for me?

860
00:46:15,653 --> 00:46:17,814
I'll tend to you later.

861
00:46:21,959 --> 00:46:25,952
Anyway, folks,
the finish line is in town.

862
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:27,657
And one more thing.

863
00:46:27,731 --> 00:46:30,825
Oh, yeah, I get it. Right.
Be brief.

864
00:46:30,901 --> 00:46:33,392
Well, to be brief, folks,

865
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,439
stationed at each
and every point,

866
00:46:35,506 --> 00:46:36,905
there will be an official

867
00:46:36,974 --> 00:46:39,841
selected by our impartial
race committee

868
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:42,811
to see that there's
no hanky-pankying going on.

869
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,347
Morning, Oscar.

870
00:46:44,415 --> 00:46:45,575
Snead.

871
00:46:45,649 --> 00:46:49,312
Hey, $5 says the preacher
don't make it to the canoes.

872
00:46:49,386 --> 00:46:51,445
Officials ain't allowed
to make bets.

873
00:46:51,522 --> 00:46:52,750
So?

874
00:46:53,557 --> 00:46:54,615
You givin' odds?

875
00:46:54,692 --> 00:46:57,024
You name 'em, you got 'em.

876
00:47:02,266 --> 00:47:03,824
Cat's cradles.

877
00:47:03,901 --> 00:47:05,664
It better be.

878
00:47:07,538 --> 00:47:09,733
Now, push, Mansfield.

879
00:47:09,807 --> 00:47:12,173
Push. Push.

880
00:47:18,682 --> 00:47:22,049
Ooh, I knew it
in my bones, Mansfield.

881
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:24,053
Fair race, my foot.

882
00:47:24,121 --> 00:47:27,557
My boy Eli's gonna need help,
and lots of it.

883
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:28,990
So I best get my tools.

884
00:47:29,059 --> 00:47:30,219
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

885
00:47:35,065 --> 00:47:39,297
Stand fast,
you cockeyed Cockney, you.

886
00:47:41,038 --> 00:47:42,198
Uh-oh.

887
00:47:42,273 --> 00:47:43,968
- Ooh!
- I'm sorry.

888
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:45,668
There's one thing for sure.

889
00:47:45,743 --> 00:47:49,611
Master Eli certainly
has a chance with you around.

890
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,978
Sir?

891
00:47:52,049 --> 00:47:53,175
Sir?

892
00:47:54,251 --> 00:47:56,742
Oh, sir!

893
00:47:59,423 --> 00:48:01,414
Oh, and something else
I forgot.

894
00:48:01,492 --> 00:48:03,858
Before we start the race...

895
00:48:05,296 --> 00:48:08,197
On second thought,
let's just start the race.

896
00:48:08,265 --> 00:48:10,529
Bring up the iron donkeys.

897
00:48:21,478 --> 00:48:23,275
What do you think that means?

898
00:48:23,347 --> 00:48:24,905
I don't know.

899
00:48:34,525 --> 00:48:37,460
Eli, we got somethin'
for you.

900
00:48:37,528 --> 00:48:38,495
For me?

901
00:48:38,562 --> 00:48:40,359
Be careful.
Don't squash it.

902
00:48:40,431 --> 00:48:41,762
It's for good luck.

903
00:48:41,832 --> 00:48:43,390
In case you need any.

904
00:48:51,542 --> 00:48:52,702
Oh.

905
00:48:53,444 --> 00:48:55,844
Oh, it's beautiful.

906
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,440
Eli, we know you can win.

907
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:02,747
Win? He'll be lucky
if he stays alive.

908
00:49:02,786 --> 00:49:03,844
Roxanne.

909
00:49:03,921 --> 00:49:06,389
Do you mind just having
a little faith?

910
00:49:06,457 --> 00:49:10,257
Contestants,
mount your engines!

911
00:49:24,642 --> 00:49:27,338
Don't worry. I have
nothin' to be afraid of.

912
00:49:28,846 --> 00:49:30,245
Cheer up, brother.

913
00:49:30,314 --> 00:49:32,680
We both got somethin'
to look forward to.

914
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:36,652
The town greetin' me
and Saint Peter greetin' you.

915
00:49:41,158 --> 00:49:42,557
- Eli.
- Yes?

916
00:49:42,626 --> 00:49:43,923
For luck.

917
00:49:44,495 --> 00:49:45,587
And be careful.

918
00:49:48,966 --> 00:49:52,629
Now, when you hear my gunshot,

919
00:49:52,703 --> 00:49:55,638
that's your signal
to start the race!

920
00:49:55,706 --> 00:49:57,139
Are you ready?

921
00:49:57,207 --> 00:49:58,868
- Yes.
- Yeah!

922
00:50:01,011 --> 00:50:03,070
Hey, what's goin' on?

923
00:50:03,147 --> 00:50:05,707
When are they gonna
start this thing?

924
00:50:11,922 --> 00:50:14,891
We gonna wait around here
all day?

925
00:50:17,528 --> 00:50:18,586
Hey.

926
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,397
Uhh!

927
00:50:25,636 --> 00:50:28,298
Eli, you're goin'
the wrong way!

928
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:49,554
Billy, what
are you stoppin' for?!

929
00:50:49,626 --> 00:50:50,615
Ooh!

930
00:50:52,329 --> 00:50:54,559
Get out of the way!

931
00:51:10,514 --> 00:51:11,845
Ooh!

932
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:14,139
Aah!

933
00:51:15,953 --> 00:51:17,386
Waaah!

934
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:24,623
Get off me!

935
00:51:24,695 --> 00:51:26,788
Get your foot
off of my shoe!

936
00:51:26,864 --> 00:51:29,128
Somebody get a loop on him!

937
00:51:39,042 --> 00:51:41,033
- Oh!

938
00:51:42,045 --> 00:51:43,706
Thank you very much.

939
00:51:44,948 --> 00:51:46,643
Push!
Here we go!

940
00:51:46,717 --> 00:51:47,979
Here we go!

941
00:51:52,356 --> 00:51:53,983
Is this a race

942
00:51:54,057 --> 00:51:56,548
or a ring
around the roundhouse?!

943
00:51:59,396 --> 00:52:02,331
Come on, hurry!
Get him on the track!

944
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:06,693
Let's go, Eli!
Go, Eli!

945
00:52:09,006 --> 00:52:11,998
Go, Eli!
Yay!

946
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:18,241
What's going on?!

947
00:52:18,315 --> 00:52:19,942
You're losin', that's what!

948
00:52:23,187 --> 00:52:25,121
Come on!
Get him!

949
00:52:25,189 --> 00:52:26,850
Get! Get!

950
00:52:57,588 --> 00:52:59,647
Snail foot!

951
00:52:59,756 --> 00:53:02,623
We'll see you later,
brother!

952
00:53:02,659 --> 00:53:04,217
Come on!

953
00:53:21,378 --> 00:53:23,209
Uh-oh.

954
00:53:49,273 --> 00:53:50,262
Huh?

955
00:53:59,883 --> 00:54:00,872
Aah!

956
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,981
Clear the road!

957
00:54:08,325 --> 00:54:09,587
Clear the road!

958
00:55:13,824 --> 00:55:16,657
Aah!
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

959
00:55:19,997 --> 00:55:21,430
Hey, what's that?

960
00:55:21,498 --> 00:55:24,194
Aw, it's just
another Indian sacrifice.

961
00:55:24,768 --> 00:55:27,498
What, a whole tepee?

962
00:55:31,842 --> 00:55:34,072
Yep, looks like it.

963
00:55:35,445 --> 00:55:39,176
What become of your brother?
Should've been here by now.

964
00:55:39,249 --> 00:55:40,511
You get ahead of him?

965
00:55:40,584 --> 00:55:44,111
I guess he's steamin' home,
back to Philadelphia.

966
00:55:44,187 --> 00:55:45,848
Holy horsefly!

967
00:55:47,524 --> 00:55:49,651
Would you look who that is.

968
00:55:49,726 --> 00:55:52,957
Now, how did he get there?

969
00:56:07,477 --> 00:56:08,910
You get back here,

970
00:56:08,979 --> 00:56:12,244
you schemin',
cheatin' polecat!

971
00:56:30,167 --> 00:56:33,728
You paddle like you talk!
Like a sissy!

972
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:45,375
Hey, Bloodshy!

973
00:56:45,449 --> 00:56:47,610
Quitters don't run
in our family!

974
00:56:47,684 --> 00:56:49,652
Yee-aah!

975
00:56:52,289 --> 00:56:54,348
Yah!

976
00:57:25,055 --> 00:57:26,920
Aaah! Aah!

977
00:57:46,543 --> 00:57:48,602
Wrong way.
Wrong way!

978
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:10,826
Oh, no.

979
00:58:10,901 --> 00:58:13,768
Oh, no.
Aah! Aah!

980
00:58:13,837 --> 00:58:16,067
Ohhhh!

981
00:58:35,492 --> 00:58:36,823
Help!

982
00:58:56,746 --> 00:58:58,008
Aaah!

983
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:02,543
Looks pretty good for you,
Billy.

984
00:59:02,619 --> 00:59:04,951
Yeah,
and pretty bad for him.

985
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:08,280
Hey, look!

986
00:59:09,392 --> 00:59:12,384
Am I seein'
what I think I'm seein'?

987
00:59:12,963 --> 00:59:15,397
I coulda told him
this race would get him

988
00:59:15,465 --> 00:59:17,695
one way or tother.

989
00:59:27,811 --> 00:59:30,575
Well, looks like
you might get your chance.

990
00:59:30,647 --> 00:59:34,014
I don't believe it.
I just don't believe it.

991
00:59:34,084 --> 00:59:37,884
You better get a wiggle on it.
That fella's still a-kickin'.

992
00:59:37,954 --> 00:59:40,514
Come on, Bucky,
let's help him out.

993
00:59:42,292 --> 00:59:43,657
Has he succeeded, sir?

994
00:59:43,727 --> 00:59:44,785
Has he?

995
00:59:44,861 --> 00:59:47,261
I told you that half-drowneded
church mouse

996
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:49,264
is sure givin' him
a run for it,

997
00:59:49,332 --> 00:59:51,266
in spite of them
sabotagin' Sneads.

998
00:59:51,334 --> 00:59:53,632
I daresay the Sneads
aren't bright enough

999
00:59:53,703 --> 00:59:56,228
to be doing this dastardly deed
on their own.

1000
00:59:56,306 --> 00:59:59,434
I'll do the daresayin'
'round here, Mansfield.

1001
00:59:59,509 --> 01:00:01,272
Oh, very good, sir.

1002
01:00:01,344 --> 01:00:04,279
Yeah, I daresay the Sneads
don't seem bright enough

1003
01:00:04,347 --> 01:00:05,439
to be doing this...

1004
01:00:05,515 --> 01:00:06,607
Dastardly.

1005
01:00:06,683 --> 01:00:08,776
...deed by themselves,
Mansfield.

1006
01:00:08,852 --> 01:00:11,184
- Excellent observation, sir.
- Yeah.

1007
01:00:11,254 --> 01:00:12,949
Yeah, we best get into town.

1008
01:00:13,023 --> 01:00:16,288
I got a hunch who the real
schemin' skunk is.

1009
01:00:16,359 --> 01:00:17,917
Hop aboard.

1010
01:00:20,363 --> 01:00:21,455
Where am I going now?

1011
01:00:21,598 --> 01:00:24,590
Up the mountain, just as soon
as you refresh yourself

1012
01:00:24,668 --> 01:00:25,794
with a little water.

1013
01:00:25,869 --> 01:00:26,961
Water?

1014
01:00:27,037 --> 01:00:29,631
I'm a walking sponge
right now.

1015
01:00:29,706 --> 01:00:31,469
And a cold one.

1016
01:00:31,541 --> 01:00:34,169
Don't matter.
One of the rules.

1017
01:00:34,244 --> 01:00:36,712
It's for the well-being
of both contestants.

1018
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:39,749
You saw Wild Billy
take his, didn't you?

1019
01:00:42,052 --> 01:00:44,543
Well, if Billy...

1020
01:00:47,891 --> 01:00:49,518
Mountain water.

1021
01:00:49,592 --> 01:00:52,220
I've never...

1022
01:00:52,295 --> 01:00:55,560
I've never tasted water
like this before.

1023
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:01,092
That's the funniest stuff
I've ever had.

1024
01:01:02,005 --> 01:01:03,597
Mmm, mmm.

1025
01:01:03,673 --> 01:01:06,107
You know, it's...

1026
01:01:06,176 --> 01:01:07,939
It's not bad.

1027
01:01:10,046 --> 01:01:14,779
It certainly
got rid of those shivers.

1028
01:01:17,354 --> 01:01:20,619
You know...
I kinda like it.

1029
01:01:21,925 --> 01:01:24,519
A man ought to drink water
more often.

1030
01:01:24,594 --> 01:01:27,825
I liked visitin' with you,
but you better catch Billy.

1031
01:01:27,897 --> 01:01:31,560
You gentlemen mind if I take
this little old water jug?

1032
01:01:31,634 --> 01:01:33,465
Why, I think
that'd be all right.

1033
01:01:33,536 --> 01:01:35,265
- Sure.
- Good.

1034
01:01:36,072 --> 01:01:39,132
Hey, mister!
That's not the mountain.

1035
01:01:39,209 --> 01:01:41,268
That's the river.

1036
01:01:41,344 --> 01:01:43,107
Oh, that's right, yes.

1037
01:01:43,179 --> 01:01:44,976
The mountain
and the river.

1038
01:01:45,048 --> 01:01:46,640
The mountain.

1039
01:01:46,716 --> 01:01:49,276
I'll start right on up.
Yeah.

1040
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:01,588
‘Eli groggy.’

1041
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:05,597
‘But right behind
Wild Billy.’

1042
01:02:18,281 --> 01:02:20,181
You think Eli can win?

1043
01:02:20,683 --> 01:02:22,241
Against a stacked deck?

1044
01:02:26,022 --> 01:02:28,354
We better find out
what they're up to.

1045
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,727
RAGSDALE: If you don't get
that preacher on the mountain,

1046
01:02:39,803 --> 01:02:41,964
make sure you get him
at Devil's Gorge.

1047
01:02:42,038 --> 01:02:43,505
I told you, quit worryin'.

1048
01:02:43,573 --> 01:02:46,406
Ain't no possible way
he can get by the gorge.

1049
01:02:46,476 --> 01:02:47,500
That's good.

1050
01:02:47,577 --> 01:02:50,307
All right, here's the gravy
that I promised you.

1051
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:52,814
After you get rid
of that psalm singer...

1052
01:02:52,882 --> 01:02:55,043
Pay attention!

1053
01:02:55,118 --> 01:02:57,416
We're plannin'
a little dynamite party

1054
01:02:57,487 --> 01:02:59,648
for Wild Billy
at Deadman's Pass.

1055
01:02:59,756 --> 01:03:01,724
- Wild Billy?
- Yep.

1056
01:03:01,758 --> 01:03:04,750
You want to get rid
of Wild Billy, too?

1057
01:03:04,828 --> 01:03:06,728
I don't know.

1058
01:03:06,796 --> 01:03:09,060
You see,
I've doctored that will.

1059
01:03:09,132 --> 01:03:12,260
You see, if nobody wins,
then the money and the saloon,

1060
01:03:12,335 --> 01:03:16,237
the town goes to the executor
of that will, and that's me.

1061
01:03:16,306 --> 01:03:18,934
Now, you and your brothers,
being my partners,

1062
01:03:19,008 --> 01:03:22,444
why, you'll get, uh, uh...

1063
01:03:22,512 --> 01:03:24,173
half.

1064
01:03:25,682 --> 01:03:28,276
Well, now do you want
to bump off Wild Billy?

1065
01:03:28,351 --> 01:03:31,809
Does a coyote like to howl?

1066
01:03:31,888 --> 01:03:34,482
Here's where you're gonna
come down the trail.

1067
01:03:34,557 --> 01:03:35,489
Right there.

1068
01:03:35,558 --> 01:03:37,958
That's where you put
the dynamite, there.

1069
01:03:38,027 --> 01:03:38,959
Got it.

1070
01:03:39,028 --> 01:03:40,120
Okay.

1071
01:03:40,196 --> 01:03:42,164
This is gonna be a cinch.

1072
01:03:42,232 --> 01:03:43,665
All right, now let's go.

1073
01:03:46,536 --> 01:03:47,560
Come on.

1074
01:03:55,545 --> 01:03:56,477
Sir!

1075
01:03:56,546 --> 01:03:59,481
Let go, Mansfield!
They're gonna get my sons!

1076
01:03:59,582 --> 01:04:00,708
Over my dead body.

1077
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:03,742
But, sir, there must be
another way of handling this.

1078
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:06,516
Would you take
your hands off... ow!

1079
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,763
Where have you two been?

1080
01:04:18,835 --> 01:04:21,099
They're gonna get
Brother Eli!

1081
01:04:21,171 --> 01:04:22,103
Hyah!

1082
01:04:22,172 --> 01:04:24,402
- Whoa! Whoa! What?
- Wild Billy, too!

1083
01:04:24,474 --> 01:04:26,442
With dynamite
at Deadman's Pass.

1084
01:04:26,509 --> 01:04:27,441
Wait a minute.

1085
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:30,035
We don't have time
for you not to believe us.

1086
01:04:30,113 --> 01:04:31,637
I'm going with you.

1087
01:04:31,714 --> 01:04:32,874
Hyah!

1088
01:04:49,532 --> 01:04:51,966
Good goin', Billy.
You made it.

1089
01:04:52,035 --> 01:04:54,265
Well, what did you expect?

1090
01:04:54,337 --> 01:04:56,237
I always figured
you'd be first...

1091
01:04:56,306 --> 01:04:57,898
- Hold it!

1092
01:04:58,007 --> 01:04:59,668
Can you hear
somebody singin'?

1093
01:04:59,709 --> 01:05:02,177
Yeah. Real pretty.

1094
01:05:02,245 --> 01:05:04,611
It's that blasted bulldog.

Now!

Oh!

1114
01:06:31,534 --> 01:06:33,263
Wonder where they came from.

1115
01:06:33,336 --> 01:06:36,669
The biggest hailstones
I've ever seen.

1116
01:06:36,739 --> 01:06:39,936
Boy, he's slipperier
than a dad-gum snake.

1117
01:06:41,277 --> 01:06:43,768
Mmm. Mmm.

1118
01:06:43,846 --> 01:06:45,336
Ahh.

1119
01:06:45,415 --> 01:06:47,349
This has got to do it.

1120
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:53,511
- I'll tell you when.
- Right.

1121
01:07:00,897 --> 01:07:02,125
Okay!

1122
01:07:13,876 --> 01:07:15,741
Ahh.

1123
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:23,414
Ohhh.

1124
01:07:23,486 --> 01:07:26,978
The world trembles
at your beauty.

1125
01:07:29,025 --> 01:07:31,084
Don't tell me
we missed him again.

1126
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:34,561
We'll get him.
At the gorge.

1127
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:37,360
That's the way!
Keep it up!

1128
01:07:37,433 --> 01:07:38,957
You're doing terrific!

1129
01:07:45,842 --> 01:07:47,639
Congratulations, Billy.

1130
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:49,371
Why, with the lead
you've got,

1131
01:07:49,445 --> 01:07:52,209
you could let them horses
ride you and still win.

1132
01:07:52,281 --> 01:07:53,748
That stall-fed tenderfoot

1133
01:07:53,816 --> 01:07:56,250
got no business
being in the race.

1134
01:07:56,319 --> 01:07:58,287
But he hasn't come by yet.

1135
01:07:58,388 --> 01:08:01,118
So you don't have
anything to worry about.

1136
01:08:01,157 --> 01:08:02,749
Wha...

1137
01:08:03,793 --> 01:08:06,591
Hello, Billy!

1138
01:08:06,662 --> 01:08:10,689
Now, how does that him-hummer
keep a-doin' it?

1139
01:08:10,767 --> 01:08:12,962
The team's just up the hill!

1140
01:08:22,145 --> 01:08:26,081
That's the skinniest-looking
bridge I've ever seen.

1141
01:08:26,149 --> 01:08:27,480
Ooh!

1142
01:08:28,484 --> 01:08:30,452
Yee-haw!

1143
01:08:45,601 --> 01:08:48,331
Eli, what are you doin'?

1144
01:08:50,406 --> 01:08:52,931
Not that-a way!

1145
01:08:53,009 --> 01:08:55,443
Hand over hand!

1146
01:08:55,511 --> 01:08:56,773
You mean...

1147
01:08:56,846 --> 01:08:59,406
Yeah!
Hand over hand!

1148
01:09:05,588 --> 01:09:09,388
No!
You don't understand!

1149
01:09:09,459 --> 01:09:12,292
You don't have to walk
on 'em!

1150
01:09:12,361 --> 01:09:14,295
Oh!

1151
01:09:20,470 --> 01:09:23,906
Come on!
You can make it!

1152
01:09:27,143 --> 01:09:28,474
No, he can't!

1153
01:09:28,544 --> 01:09:29,977
Aaah!

1154
01:09:30,046 --> 01:09:34,574
Hey, preacher!
How do you like the view?

1155
01:09:38,821 --> 01:09:42,052
This is no time
to be lyin' down on the job!

1156
01:09:47,196 --> 01:09:48,424
Help!

1157
01:09:48,498 --> 01:09:50,591
Yeah, boys, help him out!

1158
01:09:53,870 --> 01:09:55,804
What do you think
you're doing?!

1159
01:09:55,872 --> 01:09:58,170
After you.

1160
01:10:00,643 --> 01:10:02,611
Aaah! Aah!

1161
01:10:05,615 --> 01:10:09,346
Go on, get that other surprise
ready up at Deadman's Pass.

1162

This hombre's a goner.

1163
01:10:11,187 --> 01:10:13,052
- Okay, boss.
- You bet.

1164
01:10:27,503 --> 01:10:29,437

You ain't never
gonna make it, preacher!

1169
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:49,981
Ah!

1170
01:10:51,227 --> 01:10:52,990
Take a long look down

1171
01:10:53,062 --> 01:10:55,622
and say your last prayer,
preacher!

1172
01:10:57,667 --> 01:11:00,363
Amen and adios!

Unh!

1176
01:11:11,347 --> 01:11:12,837
Oh! Ah!

1177
01:11:19,755 --> 01:11:21,052
Eli!

1178
01:11:25,261 --> 01:11:28,697

I could help you, son.

1179
01:11:40,876 --> 01:11:42,901
Eeh! Ooh!

1180
01:11:42,979 --> 01:11:47,814
Mansfield,
have you gone plum loco?

1181
01:12:04,834 --> 01:12:06,825
Aaah! Ohh!

1182
01:12:08,738 --> 01:12:11,536

Hit him! Hit him!

1183
01:12:13,342 --> 01:12:15,537
Ohh! Oh!

1184
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:22,717
Good!
We did it.

1185
01:12:22,785 --> 01:12:23,945
Yeah!

1186
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:25,954
He went over easier
than I thought.

1187
01:12:26,022 --> 01:12:27,785
He sure did.

1188
01:12:27,857 --> 01:12:29,154
Look!

1189
01:12:29,225 --> 01:12:30,715
Oh, no!

1190
01:12:34,697 --> 01:12:36,562
Hang on, Eli!

1191
01:12:36,632 --> 01:12:38,964
Aaaaaah!

1192
01:12:39,035 --> 01:12:40,263

01:12:40,336 --> 01:12:42,736
Hurry! Hurry!

1194
01:12:44,573 --> 01:12:45,733
Oh, thank heaven.

1195
01:12:47,276 --> 01:12:48,903
Hang on, Eli!

1196
01:12:48,978 --> 01:12:52,379
Yeah, hang on!
We'll save you!

1197
01:12:53,949 --> 01:12:55,246
Aaah!

1198
01:12:56,719 --> 01:12:58,209
Help me up.

1199
01:12:59,455 --> 01:13:01,320
Quick, Jenny, the rope!

1200
01:13:06,562 --> 01:13:08,826
- Aaah!

1201
01:13:08,898 --> 01:13:09,830
Aah!

1202
01:13:09,899 --> 01:13:11,389
Here, Eli!

1203
01:13:14,036 --> 01:13:15,435
All right, hit him.

1204
01:13:15,504 --> 01:13:17,495
- Hyah!
- Go on! Go!

1205
01:13:17,573 --> 01:13:18,505
Hyah!

1206
01:13:18,574 --> 01:13:21,566
Aah, aah, aah, aah!
Aah! Aah!

1207
01:13:21,644 --> 01:13:22,906
Oh!

1208
01:13:24,246 --> 01:13:25,713
Let go, Eli!

1209
01:13:25,781 --> 01:13:28,011
Eli, let go!

1210
01:13:28,084 --> 01:13:29,745
Aaah!

1211
01:13:29,819 --> 01:13:31,480
Is he all right?

1212
01:13:33,923 --> 01:13:38,121
Wow, that mountain water
sure makes you do funny things.

1213
01:13:38,194 --> 01:13:39,855
Ragsdale's in it
with the Sneads!

1214
01:13:39,929 --> 01:13:41,590
They're out to get Billy,
too.

1215
01:13:41,664 --> 01:13:44,326
If both of you don't make it,
Ragsdale gets everything.

1216
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:45,890
You gotta win!

1217
01:13:45,968 --> 01:13:48,630
The only thing I've got to do
is save my brother.

1218
01:13:48,704 --> 01:13:52,231
This map shows the dynamite and
where the Sneads are gonna be.

1219
01:13:52,308 --> 01:13:55,505
You'll lose the race
to save someone who hates you.

1220
01:13:55,578 --> 01:13:57,978
Well, isn't that
what we're supposed to do?

1221
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,071
Help anybody
who needs saving, hmm?

1222
01:14:00,783 --> 01:14:03,149
Yeah.
I guess so.

1223
01:14:03,219 --> 01:14:04,208
Come on.

1224
01:14:05,221 --> 01:14:06,882
Come on!

1225
01:14:08,657 --> 01:14:09,624
Come on!

1226
01:14:09,692 --> 01:14:12,160
Hey, you two, wait for us!

1227
01:14:20,436 --> 01:14:21,994
Tallyho.

1228
01:14:23,005 --> 01:14:24,097
Gee-up.

1229
01:14:24,173 --> 01:14:25,663
Give me those!

1230
01:14:25,741 --> 01:14:28,107
Hyah!

1231
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:46,925
Aah! Oh!

1232
01:14:46,996 --> 01:14:49,464
Look out!

1233
01:14:53,435 --> 01:14:56,370
Everybody, in the back!
Quickly!

1234
01:15:09,752 --> 01:15:12,152
Hey, is everybody all right?

1235
01:15:12,221 --> 01:15:13,347
Yeah, Jenny.

1236
01:15:17,393 --> 01:15:18,655
Eli, look at that.

1237
01:15:18,727 --> 01:15:20,024
Yeah, what is it?

1238
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:35,002
It's those Sneads.

1239
01:15:35,077 --> 01:15:36,009
Yeah.

1240
01:15:39,481 --> 01:15:40,413
You see anything?

1241
01:15:40,482 --> 01:15:42,507
No, no sign of him yet.

1242
01:15:48,257 --> 01:15:49,747
The lookout has the rifle.

1243
01:15:49,825 --> 01:15:50,985
Eli can handle him.

1244
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:54,188
I hope so. We've got to get him
away from that plunger.

1245
01:15:54,263 --> 01:15:57,096
If he falls on it, the
whole mountainside will go.

1246
01:15:57,166 --> 01:15:59,031
- I got an idea.
- Oh, really?

1247
01:15:59,134 --> 01:16:00,567
You get behind that rock.

1248
01:16:00,603 --> 01:16:01,900
Right.

1249
01:16:01,971 --> 01:16:04,633
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

1250
01:16:17,019 --> 01:16:19,214
Now cover it up.

1251
01:16:25,895 --> 01:16:27,590
All right.

1252
01:16:39,241 --> 01:16:40,367
Unh!

1253
01:16:43,846 --> 01:16:46,644
Why, you little dad-gum
cotton-pickin'...

1254
01:16:48,050 --> 01:16:49,950
Now!

1255
01:16:50,019 --> 01:16:51,077
Aah!

1256
01:16:51,153 --> 01:16:53,144
Billy!
Get back!

1257
01:16:53,222 --> 01:16:55,747
Get back!

1258
01:16:57,493 --> 01:16:58,926
Whoa!

1259
01:16:59,028 --> 01:17:01,053
Whoa!

1260
01:17:06,268 --> 01:17:08,133
Let go of my hair!

1261
01:17:11,740 --> 01:17:14,174
Get off of me,
you little pony!

1262
01:17:14,243 --> 01:17:16,973
Just keep him buttoned up.

1263
01:17:17,046 --> 01:17:18,377
Billy!

1264
01:17:23,218 --> 01:17:26,016
- Pete, get on that plunger.
- Yeah, boss.

1265
01:17:29,892 --> 01:17:30,859
Did he hear him?

1266
01:17:30,926 --> 01:17:32,393
I don't know.
I'm not sure.

1267
01:17:34,263 --> 01:17:37,699
Ain't a bad swap, huh?
Two brothers for a fortune.

1268
01:17:42,171 --> 01:17:43,433
Git!

1269
01:17:44,273 --> 01:17:46,104
Hey, he's a-movin'!

1270
01:17:50,879 --> 01:17:54,747
When he gets to the mine,
they both get it.

1271
01:17:54,817 --> 01:17:56,785
No! No!

1272
01:18:05,861 --> 01:18:08,022
Shall I help you
steady the rifle, sir?

1273
01:18:08,097 --> 01:18:11,328
Only when I decide
to aim it at you, Mansfield.

1274
01:18:12,601 --> 01:18:15,468
He's getting
pretty close, boss.

1275
01:18:15,537 --> 01:18:17,869
All right, get ready.

1276
01:18:21,043 --> 01:18:22,203
Should I blow it now?

1277
01:18:22,277 --> 01:18:25,212
No.
Not yet.

1278
01:18:25,814 --> 01:18:27,179
Ready?

1279
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:31,651
- Unh!
- Aah!

1280
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:33,620
Billy! Dynamite!

1281
01:18:33,689 --> 01:18:34,917
Get him!

1282
01:18:34,990 --> 01:18:36,218
Get down!

1283
01:18:38,127 --> 01:18:39,253
Oh!

1284
01:18:39,328 --> 01:18:41,228
Where is he?!

1285
01:18:41,897 --> 01:18:43,387
- Oh!
- Oh!

1286
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:47,564
Oh, yes! Oh! Oh!

1287
01:18:47,636 --> 01:18:49,604
I got him, Eli!
I got him!

1288
01:18:49,671 --> 01:18:50,933
You?
It was Jenny.

1289
01:18:51,006 --> 01:18:53,600
I don't think it was me.
I think it was the...

1290
01:18:53,675 --> 01:18:54,835
Oh, no!

1291
01:19:06,688 --> 01:19:08,952
Uh, I don't know
what that was, folks.

1292
01:19:09,024 --> 01:19:11,424
It could have been thunder.

1293
01:19:11,493 --> 01:19:13,154
But one thing I do know.

1294
01:19:13,228 --> 01:19:16,356
A winner could be coming in
any minute now.

1295
01:19:23,705 --> 01:19:25,002
Oh, Eli.

1296
01:19:25,074 --> 01:19:26,701
I've got to find out.

1297
01:19:52,868 --> 01:19:54,426
Billy!

1298
01:19:54,503 --> 01:19:56,061
Billy!

1299
01:20:03,846 --> 01:20:06,041
Billy!

1300
01:20:06,115 --> 01:20:07,776
Billy!

1301
01:20:07,850 --> 01:20:09,613
Billy!

1302
01:20:10,652 --> 01:20:14,213
Are you just gonna stand there
caterwaulin' all day?

1303
01:20:15,724 --> 01:20:17,487
Thank heaven you're safe.

1304
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:21,987
I might have knowed it.
Never trust a Bible-banger.

1305
01:20:22,064 --> 01:20:24,430
You went and ruined everything.

1306
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:25,432
What?

1307
01:20:25,501 --> 01:20:28,868
The will says,
‘May the best man win.’

1308
01:20:28,937 --> 01:20:32,771
Now I ain't so sure
I am the best man.

1309
01:20:32,841 --> 01:20:34,706
You saved my life!

1310
01:20:34,776 --> 01:20:38,507
Now, how am I gonna whip a man
who saves my life?

1311
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:41,310
Billy, Ragsdale set us
both up to be killed,

1312
01:20:41,383 --> 01:20:44,250
and he's going to get
all the money if nobody wins.

1313
01:20:44,319 --> 01:20:46,446
Ragsdale?

1314
01:20:46,522 --> 01:20:49,355
That snivelin' sneak!

1315
01:20:49,424 --> 01:20:51,358
Then one of us has gotta win.

1316
01:20:54,897 --> 01:20:57,525
Thank you, Sheriff.
Thank you, thank you, boys.

1317
01:20:57,599 --> 01:21:00,966
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
all my loyal constituents.

1318
01:21:01,069 --> 01:21:05,062
Now, then,
as executor of the estate

1319
01:21:05,107 --> 01:21:10,044
of the late, great,
beloved Jasper Bloodshy...

1320
01:21:11,446 --> 01:21:15,473
I was fully prepared
to turn over his entire,

1321
01:21:15,551 --> 01:21:19,612
every last cent
of that fortune

1322
01:21:19,688 --> 01:21:22,589
to whichever brother wins,
whichever one comes in.

1323
01:21:24,293 --> 01:21:26,056
But, uh...

1324
01:21:26,128 --> 01:21:29,154
Well, it seems to me
that if there is to be a winner,

1325
01:21:29,231 --> 01:21:33,065
he should have been here
a long time ago, hmm?

1326
01:21:33,135 --> 01:21:35,729
Matter of fact,
it has occurred to me,

1327
01:21:35,804 --> 01:21:41,333
as I am sure it has occurred
to each and every one of you,

1328
01:21:41,410 --> 01:21:44,777
that some unforeseen,
dire tragedy

1329
01:21:44,846 --> 01:21:48,748
has befallen those two
fine young men, huh?

1330
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:51,479
Let's take him, too.

1331
01:21:51,553 --> 01:21:52,850
No, no, come on.

1332
01:21:52,921 --> 01:21:54,115
However!

1333
01:21:54,189 --> 01:21:58,148
However, there is a, uh,
provision in the will

1334
01:21:58,260 --> 01:22:02,060
which states
that if there is no winner,

1335
01:22:02,097 --> 01:22:04,793
then the entire fortune
goes to...

1336
01:22:04,866 --> 01:22:06,527
Rider comin'!

1337
01:22:06,602 --> 01:22:08,399
A rider comin'.

1338
01:22:08,470 --> 01:22:10,028
Rider comin'?

1339
01:22:10,105 --> 01:22:12,869
Who is it?
Can you see?

1340
01:22:15,611 --> 01:22:16,771
I don't believe it!

1341
01:22:25,053 --> 01:22:27,044
Are you sure
that's the preacher?

1342
01:22:30,626 --> 01:22:32,025
[Laughs excitedly]

1343
01:22:32,094 --> 01:22:34,756
It's Eli!
He's won!

1344
01:22:38,767 --> 01:22:40,758
Whoa!

1345
01:22:40,836 --> 01:22:42,736
You're safe!
How's Billy?

1346
01:22:42,804 --> 01:22:44,738
Eli, we knew
you could do it!

1347
01:22:44,806 --> 01:22:46,569
Where's Ragsdale?!

1348
01:22:46,642 --> 01:22:47,939
There he goes!

1349
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:50,274
MARCUS: With as much money
as he can get away with.

1350
01:22:50,345 --> 01:22:51,835
Hold it, Ragsdale!

1351
01:22:51,913 --> 01:22:53,847
Hyah, hyah!
Go on! Get out of here!

1352
01:22:53,915 --> 01:22:56,679
Move it! Hyah!
Get out of here!

1353
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:02,083
Hey, Eli, you're shootin'
just like Wild Billy.

1354
01:23:02,157 --> 01:23:05,058
Come back here,
you consarn, yellow-bellied,

1355
01:23:05,127 --> 01:23:07,823
lily-livered,
two-timin' polecat!

1356
01:23:07,896 --> 01:23:09,193
Yah!

1357
01:23:09,264 --> 01:23:12,233
Eli isn't Eli.
Eli's Wild Billy.

1358
01:23:12,301 --> 01:23:14,201
Another rider comin'!

1359
01:23:14,269 --> 01:23:16,703
- Which one's this?
- Is it Eli or Billy?

1360
01:23:16,772 --> 01:23:20,003
Now, there's Eli.
I think.

1361
01:23:20,075 --> 01:23:23,101
Brother,
I'd like a word with you.

1362
01:23:28,283 --> 01:23:31,218
I said, ‘Brother,
I'd like a word with you.’

1363
01:23:31,286 --> 01:23:32,947
Later!
Swing me up!

1364
01:23:34,823 --> 01:23:35,881
Aah!

1365
01:23:53,241 --> 01:23:55,766
I'm ready, Rattlesnake.

1366
01:23:55,844 --> 01:23:57,971
Let's make it clean and fast.

1367
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,914
All right.
We'll count to three.

1368
01:24:04,519 --> 01:24:06,350
I'm gonna get you, Ragsdale!

1369
01:24:11,827 --> 01:24:13,727
Marcus, what are you doing?

1370
01:24:13,795 --> 01:24:14,853
Oh, no!

1371
01:24:16,465 --> 01:24:19,195
Hey, what is this?
Get that off!

1372
01:24:19,768 --> 01:24:22,430
I don't see any way
you can trick me this time.

1373
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:28,066
1.

1374
01:24:31,012 --> 01:24:32,343
2.

1375
01:24:32,414 --> 01:24:35,440
Get off me!
What is this thing? Get away!

1376
01:24:36,017 --> 01:24:36,779
3.

1377
01:24:36,852 --> 01:24:39,343
Get off!
Get off!

1378
01:24:39,421 --> 01:24:41,184
- Aah!
- Ooh!

1379
01:24:41,256 --> 01:24:42,587
Aah! Aah!

1380
01:24:42,657 --> 01:24:44,090
Hold on!

1381
01:24:47,329 --> 01:24:48,591
Come on, get him!

1382
01:24:48,663 --> 01:24:50,221
Get him, Eli!
He's a crook!

1383
01:24:50,298 --> 01:24:51,788
He's got all the money!

1384
01:24:53,135 --> 01:24:54,898
Look out!

1385
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:03,607
Tarnation!

1386
01:25:04,379 --> 01:25:06,074
Marcus, are you all right?

1387
01:25:06,148 --> 01:25:07,706
That was great!

1388
01:25:07,783 --> 01:25:08,772
What?

1389
01:25:11,953 --> 01:25:13,750
Here he comes, Mansfield!

1390
01:25:13,822 --> 01:25:17,087
The dirty fly
into the spider's web.

1391
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:26,494
Stand back, Mansfield,
and see how the West was won.

1392
01:25:27,135 --> 01:25:28,261
Ehhh! Ooh!

1393
01:25:28,336 --> 01:25:29,894
Oh, sir!

1394
01:25:29,971 --> 01:25:31,939
Great jumpin' Jasper's ghost!

1395
01:25:32,007 --> 01:25:32,939
Aaah!

1396
01:25:33,008 --> 01:25:33,997
Ohh!

1397
01:25:34,075 --> 01:25:36,236
Aah! It's a ghost!
It's a ghost!

1398
01:25:39,147 --> 01:25:42,014
I can't be seein' this.
I know I'm not seein' this.

1399
01:25:42,083 --> 01:25:44,950
- But get off me!
- Nothing doin', Ragsdale!

1400
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:47,454
I'm takin' you with me!

1401
01:25:47,522 --> 01:25:50,821
I take everything back!
I'll give you the money back!

1402
01:25:50,892 --> 01:25:52,655
Too late, you whinin' weasel!

1403
01:25:52,727 --> 01:25:54,285
I'll see you in jail

1404
01:25:54,362 --> 01:25:58,765
if it's the last thing
I ever do-o-o!

1405
01:26:01,069 --> 01:26:04,095
It was the old man,
I tell you! I saw him!

1406
01:26:04,172 --> 01:26:07,005
I tell you, it was
the strangest thing I ever saw.

1407
01:26:07,075 --> 01:26:09,236
He came floatin' down
in a white sheet.

1408
01:26:09,311 --> 01:26:12,109
The bats have taken over
the belfry.

1409
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:14,705
You gotta believe me!
Hey, Sheriff!

1410
01:26:14,783 --> 01:26:17,217
Listen, you start that story
one more time,

1411
01:26:17,285 --> 01:26:20,379
there'll be two ghosts,
and you'll be one!

1412
01:26:20,455 --> 01:26:22,150
I'll be late
for that ceremony.

1413
01:26:22,224 --> 01:26:24,385
Deputy, keep an eye
on the prisoners.

1414
01:26:24,459 --> 01:26:26,689
Right, chief.

1415
01:26:26,761 --> 01:26:29,855
Deputy?
You gotta believe me, man!

1416
01:26:29,931 --> 01:26:32,092
[Cheers and applause]

1417
01:26:32,167 --> 01:26:34,397
And so my brother and I
have decided

1418
01:26:34,469 --> 01:26:39,202
to share the money
and use it to make a new town.

1419
01:26:39,274 --> 01:26:40,798
A town
a whole lot different

1420
01:26:40,876 --> 01:26:44,107
than the one
you've been used to.

1421
01:26:44,179 --> 01:26:47,171
And if anybody has
any other ideas,

1422
01:26:47,249 --> 01:26:49,183
they're gonna have to
answer to m...

1423
01:26:51,152 --> 01:26:53,017
My brother, Eli.

1424
01:26:54,656 --> 01:26:57,750
It's going to be a town
I hope you'll all be proud of.

1425
01:26:57,859 --> 01:27:00,453
I know I'm going to be proud
of the new church

1426
01:27:00,495 --> 01:27:02,554
and the new school
we're building.

1427
01:27:02,631 --> 01:27:07,728
A new school for our children,
yours and mine.

1428
01:27:07,802 --> 01:27:10,498
He means us.
We've got a father.

1429
01:27:10,572 --> 01:27:12,403
And I'll tell you
something else.

1430
01:27:12,474 --> 01:27:15,602
Not only will these children
have the best teacher,

1431
01:27:15,677 --> 01:27:18,441
they'll have the prettiest one
they've ever seen.

1432
01:27:18,513 --> 01:27:20,674
[Laughter and applause]

1433
01:27:20,749 --> 01:27:24,276
Of course, I may be
a little prejudiced.

1434
01:27:24,853 --> 01:27:27,344
I think we're gettin'
a mother, too.

1435
01:27:30,492 --> 01:27:32,619
You know,
I can't rightly recollect

1436
01:27:32,694 --> 01:27:34,855
ever seein'
the whole town together

1437
01:27:34,930 --> 01:27:38,525
with folks a-smilin' at each
other instead of shootin'.

1438
01:27:40,569 --> 01:27:43,436
I think this is a fitting moment
now to pay tribute

1439
01:27:43,505 --> 01:27:45,996
to the one man
who made all this possible.

1440
01:27:46,074 --> 01:27:49,202
Our father, Jasper Bloodshy.

1441
01:27:51,379 --> 01:27:53,472
It's too bad
he couldn't have lived

1442
01:27:53,548 --> 01:27:55,812
to see his last wish come true.

1443
01:27:55,884 --> 01:27:57,010
Amen, brother.

1444
01:27:57,085 --> 01:27:59,144
But if you'll all join in
with me now

1445
01:27:59,254 --> 01:28:01,745
singing ‘Something Good
is Bound to Happen,’

1446
01:28:01,790 --> 01:28:03,690
I guarantee
no matter where he is,

1447
01:28:03,758 --> 01:28:06,056
he'll be happy
at this very moment.

1448

Don't shush me,
you British buzzard!

1456
01:28:24,479 --> 01:28:26,879
Can't a man sing
when he's happy?

1457
01:28:26,948 --> 01:28:29,007
Well, sir,
then you might reconsider

1458
01:28:29,084 --> 01:28:30,381
and make an appearance.

1459
01:28:30,452 --> 01:28:33,910
And send the whole town off
to the loony bin, like Ragsdale?

1460
01:28:33,989 --> 01:28:37,186
No, I finished what
I set out to do, Mansfield.

1461
01:28:37,258 --> 01:28:38,589
It's time to move on.

1462
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:40,321
Where to, sir?

1463
01:28:40,395 --> 01:28:43,421
Yeah, to a place I ain't seen
for years, Mansfield.

1464
01:28:43,498 --> 01:28:44,692
Cactus Ridge.

1465
01:28:44,766 --> 01:28:46,893
Cactus Ridge?
Why Cactus Ridge, sir?

1466
01:28:46,968 --> 01:28:50,426
Now I've straightened out
my sons, Wild Billy and Eli,

1467
01:28:50,505 --> 01:28:52,598
I gotta go see
how my daughters,

1468
01:28:52,674 --> 01:28:55,939
Calico Kate and Wildcat Winnie,
are doin'.

1469
01:28:56,011 --> 01:28:58,104
Let's go, Mansfield!

1470
01:28:58,213 --> 01:29:00,181
Very good, sir.

1471
01:29:01,650 --> 01:29:04,949
Gee-up!
Gee-up, there!

1472
01:29:06,621 --> 01:29:08,316
Mornin', Sheriff.

1473
01:29:08,390 --> 01:29:10,290
