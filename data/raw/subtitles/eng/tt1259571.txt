1
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,733
"Childhood is not
from birth to a certain age.

2
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:31,906
"And at a certain age, the child is grown
and puts away childish things.

3
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,625
"Childhood is the kingdom
where nobody dies."

4
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,510
Jake! Jacob!

5
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,167
Phil!

6
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,715
It's happening.

7
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,229
You just have to break them in.

8
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:49,108
I've been breaking them in. For three days.

9
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:50,193
Can l just go barefoot?

10
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,612
No, absolutely not.

11
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,906
Just thinking it's a little much, you know?

12
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,200
The dress and the shoes,

13
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:58,493
and all of this.

14
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,413
No, it's exactly enough.

15
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,707
Tomorrow will be perfect.

16
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:06,834
Where do you want them, boss?

17
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,294
On either side of the aisle.

18
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:12,048
-What aisle?
-Does no one have vision?

19
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,527
You, go home and get lots of beauty sleep.

20
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,861
That's an order.

21
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,364
Okay.

22
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,122
l was just checking for cold feet.

23
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,460
Well, mine are toasty warm.

24
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,212
It's not too late to change your mind.

25
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:34,922
What? Now you're having second thoughts?

26
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,135
You are.

27
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,098
No, I've been waiting a century
to marry you, Miss Swan.

28
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:49,061
But?

29
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,232
l haven't told you everything about myself.

30
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:54,567
What? You're not a virgin?

31
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:06,787
Look, you can't scare me away now.

32
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,501
Look, a few years after Carlisle created me,

33
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,630
l rebelled against him.

34
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,258
l resented him for curbing my appetite.

35
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,719
And so for a while, l went off on my own.

36
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,430
l wanted to know how it felt to hunt.

37
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,396
To taste human blood.

38
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,232
All the men I killed

39
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,069
were monsters.

40
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,033
And so was I.

41
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,581
Edward, they were all murderers.

42
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,670
You probably saved more lives
than you took.

43
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,172
Bella, that's what l told myself.

44
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,967
But they were all human beings.

45
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:48,014
l looked into their eyes as they died
and l saw who l was,

46
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,849
and what l was capable of.

47
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,937
And what I'll be capable of.

48
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,440
Why are you telling me this tonight?

49
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,443
Did you really think
this was gonna change my mind about you?

50
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:04,030
l just wondered
if it would change your mind about yourself,

51
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,657
and who you wanna see when
you look in the mirror a year from now.

52
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,371
l know l can do this.

53
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,707
Let me tell you why.

54
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,375
Because you did.

55
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,795
You should give yourself
some credit for that.

56
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,757
Now, hopefully, a year from now,

57
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:26,302
I'm gonna look in the mirror
and see someone like you.

58
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:33,142
l mean, someone capable of courage
and sacrifice and love.

59
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,107
--What is that?

60
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:42,151
- Come on! Let's go!
- I'm late for my bachelor party.

61
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,155
Send him out, Bella,
or we're coming in after him.

62
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,450
So, this party.

63
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,369
Will there be strippers?

64
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:57,708
No, just a couple of mountain lions.
Maybe a few bears.

65
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,629
Don't worry, Bella,
we'll give him back in plenty of time.

66
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,132
Okay, go, before they break my house.

67
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:06,967
Let's go! Let's go!

68
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,852
I'll meet you at the altar.

69
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,689
I'll be the one in white.

70
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,275
That was very convincing.

71
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,970
What did l say about beauty sleep?

72
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,348
Sorry, bad dream.

73
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,101
lt was wedding jitters.

74
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,647
Do you need some help?

75
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,066
l could do her hair.

76
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,235
Really?

77
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:36,242
Please.
I'm not offended by your choice of groom.

78
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,995
Just my blatant lack of respect for mortality.

79
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,623
Essentially.

80
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,710
Weddings. They bring everyone together.

81
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,589
Hey, so, did you find our daughter?

82
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:52,758
Are those graduation caps?

83
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,011
How creative!

84
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,681
Or weird.

85
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,015
Alice? Bella?

86
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,558
In here, Mom.

87
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,898
Oh, my gosh!

88
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:09,817
You're so beautiful.

89
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,568
Oh, honey.

90
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:12,987
Crap! My mascara.

91
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,154
Mom!

92
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,031
Thanks.

93
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,409
Charlie, get in here.

94
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,204
You sure? l don't wanna...

95
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,962
l know. l look hot.

96
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,632
We thought you needed something blue.

97
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,093
And something old.

98
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,387
- Besides your mother.
- Nice.

99
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,267
-lt was Grandma Swan's.
-But we added the sapphires.

100
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:45,811
It's beautiful, you guys.

101
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,813
Wow. Thank you so much.

102
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,232
It's your first family heirloom.

103
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:55,988
Pass on to your daughter, and her daughter.

104
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,537
Mom, l love it.

105
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,123
Nope. No smudging my masterpiece.

106
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,207
She's right.

107
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:11,712
Thank you.

108
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,091
Okay.

109
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:19,053
Time for the dress!

110
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:23,515
Do you wanna see it?
l want to see it!

111
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,781
They have got to be related.

112
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:40,824
What a gene pool.

113
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,701
Seriously.

114
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:45,371
You've got some... The drool.

115
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,793
So, you think Bella's gonna be showing?

116
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,420
Jess, she is not pregnant.

117
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:56,173
Okay. Who else gets married at 1 8?

118
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:20,989
You ready?

119
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,450
Yeah.

120
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,457
Just don't let me fall, Dad.

121
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:32,334
Never.

122
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,380
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are gathered here on this glorious day

123
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:45,509
to witness the union of Edward Cullen
and Bella Swan.

124
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,470
Please repeat after me.

125
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:52,349
l, Edward Cullen.

126
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,393
Take you, Bella Swan.

127
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,770
-Take you, Bella Swan.
-To have and to hold.

128
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,651
To have and to hold.

129
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,112
For better or for worse.

130
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:07,656
For richer, for poorer.

131
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,410
In sickness and in health.

132
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:14,871
To love.

133
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,082
To cherish.

134
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,252
As long as we both shall live.

135
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,674
l do.

136
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:31,138
l love you.

137
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:40,105
Have I found you

138
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:44,735
Flightless bird

139
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:49,323
Jealous

140
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:56,288
Weeping or lost you

141
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:03,211
American mouth

142
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:10,177
Big pill looming

143
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:16,475
Now I'm a fat house cat

144
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,313
Nursing my sore blunt tongue

145
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:25,317
Watching the warm poison rats

146
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:30,155
Curl through the wide fence cracks

147
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,038
Just thought it'd be bigger.

148
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,122
Yeah.

149
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,332
-Hi!
-Hi, guys.

150
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,335
We were just saying how pretty
everything is, you know, just saying.

151
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,629
Well, thanks so much.
You don't think it's too much?

152
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,130
-No.
-Not at all.

153
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,590
-No.
-No.

154
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,967
Hey, man. Nice to see you.

155
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,804
-I'm happy for you.
-Thank you.

156
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,389
l hope you'll be happy, Bella.

157
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,474
Thank you, Billy.

158
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,142
Have you heard from him?

159
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,228
I'm sure Jake wishes you the best.

160
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,399
Well, l plan on getting drunk.

161
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,652
They're serving up
some pretty fancy champagne.

162
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,029
Sue, can l get you a glass?

163
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,823
Sparkling fire water.

164
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:14,658
Sounds great.

165
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:18,537
Bella.

166
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,957
-Congratulations, Edward.
-Thank you.

167
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,041
Bella.

168
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:24,209
Eleazar and Carmen, right?

169
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,419
-Mmm-hmm.
-Hola.

170
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,212
Yes, and these are our cousins from Alaska.

171
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,297
-Tanya, Kate.
-We've heard so much about you.

172
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,841
-Welcome to the family.
-Bienvenida.

173
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,592
Thank you.

174
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:38,473
Irina.

175
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:40,726
Come meet Bella.

176
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,899
-l can't do this.
-You promised.

177
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:51,778
They invited one.

178
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,453
Irina, he's our friend.

179
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,246
They killed Laurent.

180
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,706
He tried to kill Bella.

181
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,833
l don't believe that.

182
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,960
He wanted to be like us.

183
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:09,546
To live in peace with humans.

184
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,047
With me.

185
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,175
I'm sorry.

186
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,803
- Irina!
- Well.

187
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,224
Let's not monopolize the bride.
Congratulations.

188
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,392
Thank you.

189
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:23,810
Sorry.

190
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,190
Well, what's a wedding
without some family drama?

191
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,691
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

192
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,359
Is this on?

193
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,570
Hello?

194
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,451
Umm, I'd like to propose a toast.

195
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,661
To my new sister.

196
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:46,291
Bella, I hope you've gotten enough sleep
these last 18 years.

197
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,544
'Cause you won't be getting any more
for a while.

198
00:18:54,383 --> 00:19:00,096
Well, Bella was just like everybody else,
totally mesmerized by Edward.

199
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,974
Or "The Hair," as l call him.

200
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,020
And then, suddenly,

201
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,356
Edward is all about Bella.

202
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:14,069
Even though she's not the captain
of the volleyball team.

203
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,905
I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.

204
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,323
Or the president of the student council.

205
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:21,076
Edward will be a good husband.

206
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,622
I know this because I'm a cop.

207
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,416
I know things.

208
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:33,421
Like how to hunt somebody
to the ends of the Earth.

209
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,217
Now that you're my sister,

210
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,261
you'll have to get over
your aversion to fashion.

211
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:42,389
And I know how to use a gun.

212
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,475
Skirts, heels, handbags.

213
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,979
Go to sleep, my love

214
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,107
Go to sleep

215
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,902
When you wake

216
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:59,155
You'll see me

217
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,575
I'd like to thank Renée and Charlie

218
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:05,954
for bringing such a wonderful person
into the world and into our lives.

219
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,082
We will cherish and protect her forever.

220
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,210
It's an extraordinary thing

221
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,298
to meet someone
who you can bare your soul to.

222
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:18,884
And who will accept you for what you are.

223
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:25,974
I've been waiting,
what seems like a very long time,

224
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,644
to get beyond what I am.

225
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,273
And with Bella,

226
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,193
I feel like I can finally begin.

227
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:45,911
So I'd like to propose a toast
to my beautiful bride.

228
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:53,168
No measure of time with you
will be long enough.

229
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,005
But let's start with forever.

230
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,853
Whoa!

231
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,691
Whoa!

232
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,702
Another one of your gifts just arrived.

233
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,120
What?

234
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:31,873
Yeah, come on.

235
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,169
What's a wedding present doing out here?

236
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,964
Just a little more private.

237
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,925
The best man didn't have time to get a tux.

238
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:43,593
Jacob!

239
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,013
Jacob.

240
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,600
--Hey.

241
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,145
-Hey, Bella.
-Hey.

242
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,022
This is kind of you.

243
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,233
Kind is my middle name.

244
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,240
I'll see if Rosalie wants to dance.

245
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:08,034
I'm sorry I'm late.

246
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:09,911
Doesn't matter.

247
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,789
Everything's perfect now.

248
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,584
Will you dance with me?

249
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:30,515
Where have you been?

250
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,436
We were gonna put your face
on a milk carton.

251
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,605
Mostly northern Canada.

252
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,275
l think.

253
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:45,363
It's weird to be back on two legs again,
in clothes.

254
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:49,409
Gotten out of practice
with the whole human thing.

255
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,663
Are you okay?

256
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,625
Being here?

257
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:02,881
Why? Afraid I'll trash your party?

258
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:13,850
You're not the only one.

259
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,981
You'd think I'd be used to telling you
goodbye by now.

260
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,864
Come on, you're not supposed to be
the one crying, Bella.

261
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,953
Everyone cries at weddings.

262
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:39,042
This is how I'm gonna remember you.

263
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,044
Pink cheeks.

264
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,380
Two left feet.

265
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:51,971
Heartbeat.

266
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,268
'Cause what,
soon I'm gonna be dead to you?

267
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:58,436
No.

268
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,448
I'm sorry.

269
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,368
I'm just trying to appreciate
your last night as a human.

270
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:17,372
Well, it's not my last night.

271
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:22,418
l thought you...

272
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:27,340
l didn't really wanna spend my honeymoon
writhing in pain.

273
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,384
What's the point?

274
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:34,222
It's not like you're gonna have
a real honeymoon with him, anyway.

275
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,891
It's gonna be as real as anyone else's.

276
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,643
That's a sick joke.

277
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:41,521
You are joking?

278
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,066
What? While you're still human?

279
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:48,403
You can't be serious, Bella.
Tell me you're not that stupid.

280
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,573
l mean, it's really none of your business.

281
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,159
-No! You can't do this!
-Jake.

282
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,119
-Listen to me, Bella.
-Jake, let me go!

283
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:58,454
Jacob, calm down, all right?

284
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,623
Are you out of your mind? Huh?
You'll kill her!

285
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,458
Walk away, Jake.

286
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:08,965
Enough, Jacob!

287
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:11,426
Stay out of this, Sam.

288
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:13,595
You're not gonna start something
that we'll have to finish.

289
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:15,013
She'll die.

290
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,598
She's not our concern anymore.

291
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,076
Let's go, Seth!

292
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,125
I'm really, really, really stupid.

293
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,793
No, it's all right.

294
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:50,965
Come on, people are probably missing us.
Let's go back.

295
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:13,029
So, he really won't tell you
where he's taking you?

296
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:14,989
No, it's a surprise.

297
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,495
Well, wear a hat.

298
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,038
Sunscreen.

299
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:23,706
Take care of yourself.

300
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,500
l will.

301
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:27,502
Okay.

302
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,506
l love you, Bella.

303
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,258
l love you.

304
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,009
So much.

305
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:44,644
Thank you.

306
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,071
Everything's packed and ready to go.

307
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,240
Cool.

308
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,080
Oh.

309
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,291
-I'm gonna go see him.
-Yeah.

310
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:16,968
Dad.

311
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:22,598
Well...

312
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,270
It's gonna be strange,

313
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,398
you not living under my roof.

314
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,318
Yeah.

315
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,987
It's gonna be strange for me, too.

316
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:40,491
You know
it will always be your home, right?

317
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,919
l love you, Dad. Forever.

318
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:00,762
l love you, too, Bells.

319
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,098
l always have and l always will.

320
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:11,356
All right.

321
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:15,526
Go on.

322
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:18,112
You don't wanna miss your plane.

323
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,448
Wherever it's going.

324
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,786
Okay.

325
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:28,498
Bye.

326
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,296
You ready?

327
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:57,193
Yeah, I'm ready.

328
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:05,553
Please pull over.

329
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:47,345
So, we're not staying in Rio?

330
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,764
No, we're just passing through.

331
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,225
Are we close?

332
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,409
That's lsle Esme.

333
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,828
lt was a gift from Carlisle.

334
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,846
ls this totally necessary?

335
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:34,141
l am nothing if not traditional.

336
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,033
You wanna take a look around?

337
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:42,001
You tired?

338
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,217
Do you wanna go for a swim?

339
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:52,386
Yeah, that sounds nice.

340
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,730
l could use a few human minutes.

341
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,946
Don't take too long, Mrs. Cullen.

342
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:14,867
Okay.

343
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,515
Okay.

344
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,934
She's a caged animal

345
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,436
London by night

346
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,689
Crashing lights and cymbals

347
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,857
Queens of twilight

348
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:49,276
And if I was you I'd use the loo

349
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,654
Before the long drive

350
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,781
We complement each other

351
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,533
Just like Satan and Christ

352
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:00,871
Baby, when I am laid to rest

353
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:03,040
May my laughter remain

354
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,918
Like your kiss blew me away

355
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:08,796
Answer your spirit

356
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,132
I gotta know right now

357
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,217
I see you before me

358
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,844
Won't you show me how?

359
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:15,928
Alice!

360
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,888
I wear my hair fizzy

361
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:20,099
I don't copy no style

362
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,893
But kissing and a-scrubbing

363
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,979
It has consequences

364
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,564
You're on the bus again

365
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:27,940
Past Big Ben

366
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,234
With your rip off Oyster card

367
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:40,828
Don't be a coward.

368
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:08,814
Gotas mínimas

369
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:31,337
Caudales de agua

370
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,299
You're so beautiful.

371
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:46,060
Agua lisa

372
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:57,238
l promised that we'd try.

373
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,200
If this doesn't work...

374
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:03,661
l trust you.

375
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:08,290
Tu vida...

376
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:30,980
I've waited a hundred years

377
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,401
But I'd wait a million more

378
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:37,778
For you

379
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:50,374
Nothing prepared me
for the privilege of being yours

380
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,834
It's okay.

381
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:07,558
If I had only felt the warmth
within your touch

382
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:15,566
If I had only seen
how you smile when you blush

383
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:23,782
Or how you curl your lip
when you concentrate enough

384
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:29,830
I would have known what I was living for

385
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:38,005
What I've been living for

386
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:49,266
Your love is my turning page

387
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:54,021
Only the sweetest words remain

388
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:04,365
Every kiss is a cursive line

389
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:09,203
Every touch is a redefining phrase

390
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:22,424
I surrender who I've been for who you are

391
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:30,140
Nothing makes me stronger
than your fragile heart

392
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:37,439
If I had only felt how it feels to be yours

393
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:39,900
I would have known

394
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:41,110
How badly are you hurt?

395
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,239
What?

396
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,001
No, Bella, look.

397
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:09,930
Bella, l can't tell you how sorry l am.

398
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:25,279
I'm not.

399
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,032
Really, I'm not. I'm fine.

400
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,992
Don't say you're fine.

401
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,745
Just don't.

402
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,705
No, you don't.

403
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:36,707
Don't ruin this.

404
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:37,916
I've already ruined it.

405
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,214
Why can't you see
how perfectly happy l am?

406
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:47,801
Or was five seconds ago.

407
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:51,680
l mean, now I'm sort of pissed off, actually.

408
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:54,058
You should be angry with me.

409
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:57,895
l mean,
we knew this was gonna be tricky, right?

410
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,939
l think we did amazing.

411
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:06,487
l mean, it was amazing for me.

412
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,907
That's what you're worried about?

413
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,117
That l didn't enjoy myself?

414
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,706
l know it's not the same for you,

415
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:23,587
but for a human, l can't imagine
that it gets any better than that.

416
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,259
Last night

417
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,096
was the best night of my existence.

418
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:38,644
You're the best.

419
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,580
You're not gonna touch me again, are you?

420
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:05,546
You know that's not what l mean.

421
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,048
Let me make you breakfast.

422
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:26,024
Dreamed last night about a time and place

423
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:31,989
Where from our troubles we had escape

424
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:38,579
I held your hand and I felt complete

425
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:45,210
As you turned and said to me

426
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:49,423
From now on

427
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:54,261
From now on we'll be

428
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,971
You and me

429
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,600
We will be

430
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,728
From now on

431
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:07,524
From now on we'll be

432
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:10,861
You and me
You and me

433
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,946
We will be

434
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:38,889
Only a dream

435
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,975
From now on

436
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,562
Only a dream

437
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:47,606
From now on

438
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,985
Only a dream

439
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:55,239
From now on

440
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:58,450
Only a dream

441
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,577
From now on

442
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:03,872
You and me, we will be

443
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,016
l win.

444
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,074
Bella?

445
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,788
You having a nightmare?

446
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:46,456
No.

447
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:57,175
lt was just a dream.

448
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,513
lt was a really good dream.

449
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,640
Then why are you crying?

450
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,644
Because l wanted it to be real.

451
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,314
Tell me.

452
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,196
Bella, l can't.

453
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:26,788
Please.

454
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:03,116
Maybe they'll say
she was in a car crash.

455
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,702
Or tripped and fell off a cliff.

456
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,455
Keep it in play! Keep it in play!

457
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:10,082
Come on!

458
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,460
Come on! Come on!

459
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:16,129
At least I'll get one thing out of it.

460
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:19,800
No, you won't.

461
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:24,221
Cullens are not a danger
to the town or the tribe.

462
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,516
Well, he's either gonna kill her
or change her.

463
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,018
-And the treaty says...
-l say, Jacob.

464
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,437
l say.

465
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:41,822
You know, if you wanted things different,
you should've become alpha.

466
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:48,245
Turning it down seemed like a good idea
at the time.

467
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:51,832
Jake, you really think you could kill Bella
if she comes back a vampire?

468
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:54,543
No, make one of us do it,
then hold a grudge against us.

469
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:56,086
Shut up, Leah.

470
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:59,548
Would you just get over it?
It's not like you've imprinted on her.

471
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:03,802
At least they seem happy.

472
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:08,098
Yeah, some people are just lucky, l guess.

473
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:09,224
Lucky?

474
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:13,812
None of them
belong to themselves anymore.

475
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:18,275
And the sickest part is
their genes tell them they're happy about it.

476
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:23,321
Least if you imprinted on someone,
you'd finally forget about Bella.

477
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:30,245
l mean, being any kind of happy is better
than being miserable

478
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,997
about someone you can't have.

479
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:52,976
Bella, these are our housekeepers,
Gustavo and Kaure.

480
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:55,770
This is my wife Bella.

481
00:46:56,189 --> 00:46:57,272
Excuse me.

482
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,778
Well, l guess we just leave them to it.

483
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:10,035
What was that all about?

484
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:11,912
She's afraid for you.

485
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:13,413
Why?

486
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:17,626
Because l have you here all alone.

487
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:21,713
You mean she knows about you?

488
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,256
She suspects.

489
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:27,969
She's native Ticuna. They have legends
about blood-drinking demons

490
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:31,097
who prey on beautiful women.

491
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:38,438
Hey.

492
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:14,641
You're late.

493
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,491
Bella?

494
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,454
Hey, don't come in here.

495
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:21,124
You don't need to see this.

496
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,461
"In sickness and health," remember?

497
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,088
lt must have been the chicken.

498
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:28,715
Could you grab my bag?

499
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,232
What is it?

500
00:49:50,071 --> 00:49:53,073
How many days has it been
since the wedding?

501
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:54,407
Fourteen. Why?

502
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,745
Will you tell me what's going on?

503
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:01,289
I'm late.

504
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:04,584
My period, it's late.

505
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:23,395
That's impossible.

506
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,440
Can this happen?

507
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:36,825
- Whoa!

508
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,544
- Alice.
- Bella?

509
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:49,879
Are you all right?

510
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:51,589
I'm not 100%¤ sure.

511
00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:54,300
Why? What's wrong? I just...

512
00:50:54,427 --> 00:50:55,927
You just what?

513
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:57,846
Alice, what did you see?

514
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,682
- Here's Carlisle.
- Bella, what's going on?

515
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:03,143
l don't know. I'm a little worried.
Can vampires go into shock?

516
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:04,811
Has Edward been harmed?

517
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:06,146
No.

518
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:12,861
l know that it's impossible,
but l think that I'm pregnant.

519
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,072
Whoa!

520
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:22,996
Carlisle, l swear,
something just moved inside me.

521
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:28,752
-ls this even possible?
-I don't know.

522
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,295
What's he saying?

523
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:32,839
The sooner Bella's here,
the sooner we can find out what it is.

524
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,424
I need you to get to the mainland at once.

525
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,259
Yeah, yeah, l will.

526
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:41,973
Well?

527
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:54,277
Damn it.

528
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:57,322
Kaure's making sure you're still alive.

529
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:11,961
Slow we paddle through the lake

530
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:16,508
Straight to the very center

531
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:21,471
Of the darkest water

532
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:25,225
Where we can embrace

533
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:29,979
The shadows on the surface

534
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:34,651
The eyes that look up lifeless

535
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:38,154
From our twins below

536
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:45,286
And though your arms and legs are under

537
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:50,291
Love will be the echo in your ears

538
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:54,128
When all is lost and plundered

539
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:58,299
My love will be there still

540
00:52:58,384 --> 00:53:03,763
True, it's chilling to behold

541
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:08,101
Up close we stumble back...

542
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:15,275
What did you do with her?

543
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:18,027
What do you know about this?

544
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,614
l know that you are a demon!

545
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:23,950
You killed this little girl!

546
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:26,911
What?

547
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:29,372
Her people have legends.
She might have seen this before.

548
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:31,583
Please.

549
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:33,459
Tell me how to help her.

550
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:35,420
You only do bad.

551
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,130
l am begging you.

552
00:53:37,673 --> 00:53:39,340
l will do anything.

553
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,217
l love her.

554
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:44,762
Please.

555
00:53:45,598 --> 00:53:47,849
Tell me how she can survive this.

556
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:20,006
Death.

557
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:38,691
I'm not gonna let it hurt you.

558
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:44,989
Carlisle will get that thing out.

559
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:56,584
Thing?

560
00:55:20,693 --> 00:55:23,236
Wait here while we load.

561
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:50,430
- Hello?
- Rosalie.

562
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:51,681
Bella?

563
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:57,770
-What's going on?
-l need your help.

564
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:24,839
Hey, Son.

565
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:25,965
What's going on?

566
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:28,217
Bella called him.

567
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:34,057
Hey, haven't seen you in a while.

568
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:37,351
-You okay?
-So, you finally heard from Bella?

569
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:41,939
They're extending their trip.

570
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:43,566
Seems she caught a bug.

571
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,486
They wanna wait until she feels better
before they travel.

572
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:48,696
She's sick.

573
00:56:48,781 --> 00:56:52,116
Yeah, she told me not to worry,
but she sounded,

574
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:57,163
l don't know, off.

575
00:56:57,790 --> 00:56:59,082
She'll be okay, Charlie.

576
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:01,834
Come on. Let's eat.

577
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,848
Jacob, let it go.

578
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:37,620
ls it true?

579
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:39,539
Hello, Jacob, how are you?

580
00:57:40,332 --> 00:57:42,542
Listen, just give it to me straight.

581
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:44,335
Jake, is that you?

582
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:49,048
-She's here?
-They came home two weeks ago.

583
00:57:49,758 --> 00:57:50,925
Jake.

584
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:12,947
I'm glad you came.

585
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:17,535
-Close enough.
-What's your problem?

586
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:20,413
Rose, it's okay.

587
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:32,758
You look terrible.

588
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:38,764
Yeah, it's nice to see you, too.

589
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,395
So, are you gonna tell me
what's wrong with you?

590
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:49,275
Rose, you wanna help me up?

591
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:09,754
You did this!

592
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:12,632
We didn't know it was even possible.

593
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:14,717
- What is it?
- I'm not sure.

594
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:17,845
Ultrasounds and needles
won't penetrate the embryonic sac.

595
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:19,847
l can't see it, either.

596
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:23,601
And l can't see Bella's future anymore.

597
00:59:24,895 --> 00:59:27,438
We've been researching legends,
but there isn't much to go on.

598
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,357
What we do know is that it's strong.

599
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:30,942
And fast-growing.

600
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:33,653
Why haven't you done anything?
Take it out of her!

601
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:36,072
This is none of your business, dog.

602
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:37,448
Rose!

603
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:39,450
All this fighting isn't good for Bella.

604
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:41,661
The fetus isn't good for Bella.

605
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:46,290
Say the word, Alice. "Baby."
It's just a little baby.

606
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:48,668
Possibly.

607
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:52,672
Carlisle, you've gotta do something.

608
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:54,257
No.

609
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:57,343
It's not his decision. It's not any of yours.

610
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,220
Jacob, l need to talk to you.

611
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:13,067
l always knew you'd destroy her.

612
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:19,240
She thinks Carlisle can turn her
at the last minute,

613
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:20,866
like he did for me and Esme.

614
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:26,122
-Can he?
-Probability is slight.

615
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,793
And if her heart fails...

616
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:39,635
Look, Jacob,
l need you to do something for me.

617
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:42,888
For her.

618
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:50,313
You have a connection with her
that I'll never understand.

619
01:00:50,856 --> 01:00:53,649
Maybe you could talk to her,
change her mind.

620
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,779
You can keep her alive.

621
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:02,366
And if l can't?

622
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,369
If she dies,

623
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:12,168
you get what you always wanted.

624
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:14,712
To kill me.

625
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:27,892
Rose, I'm fine, really.

626
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:50,706
-So, Edward sent you in here to talk to me?
-Sort of.

627
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:53,918
Though l can't figure out
why he thinks you'd listen to me.

628
01:01:54,002 --> 01:01:55,544
l mean, you never have before.

629
01:02:04,096 --> 01:02:05,763
Since when are you and blondie BFFs?

630
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:08,307
Rose understands what l want.

631
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:15,648
What are you thinking, Bella?

632
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:17,316
Seriously.

633
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:20,403
l know this seems like a scary thing,

634
01:02:21,822 --> 01:02:23,364
but it's not.

635
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:26,742
It's like this miracle or something.

636
01:02:28,537 --> 01:02:29,703
l can feel him.

637
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:33,749
So, it's a bouncing baby boy.

638
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:36,419
I'm sorry l didn't know.
Should've brought some blue balloons.

639
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:38,337
It's just a guess.

640
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:41,632
When l picture him, l see a boy.

641
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:44,677
We'll see.

642
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:47,638
You won't.

643
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:49,515
Jake, l can do this.

644
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:53,519
-I'm strong enough.
-Come on.

645
01:02:54,855 --> 01:02:58,858
You can spout that crap to your
bloodsucker, but you don't fool me.

646
01:02:58,942 --> 01:03:02,778
l can see what that thing's doing to you.
It's a killer, Bella.

647
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:05,823
-You're wrong.
-And when you die,

648
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:10,953
what was the point?
Of me loving you, you loving him.

649
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:12,913
How is that right for anyone?

650
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:14,832
Because l sure don't see it.

651
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:25,217
Listen to me, Bella.

652
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:26,552
Please.

653
01:03:27,429 --> 01:03:29,597
Just don't do this.

654
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,975
Live, okay?

655
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:35,269
Please.

656
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:38,731
Jake, everything's gonna be okay.

657
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:52,828
Jacob, don't go.

658
01:03:53,914 --> 01:03:55,706
l know how this ends.

659
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:00,711
And I'm not sticking around to watch.

660
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:40,376
Jacob.
Jake, I can do this. I can do this.

661
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:42,294
Don't do this.

662
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:43,837
I'm strong enough.
I'm strong enough.

663
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:46,382
This is none
of your business, dog.

664
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:48,133
Jacob, don't go.

665
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:49,843
You did this!

666
01:04:50,554 --> 01:04:51,887
Everything's gonna be okay.

667
01:04:51,972 --> 01:04:54,056
The fetus isn't good for Bella.

668
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:55,975
I know how this ends.

669
01:04:56,518 --> 01:04:59,144
Don't you even care that it's killing you?

670
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:40,060
Jake! Jake! Jake!

671
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:42,396
Jake! Jake! Jake!

672
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,817
- Is it true, Jacob?
- What will it be?

673
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:47,943
It's growing fast.

674
01:05:48,028 --> 01:05:49,612
- It's unnatural.
- Dangerous.

675
01:05:49,696 --> 01:05:51,614
- Monstrosity.
- An abomination.

676
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:53,365
On our land.

677
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,659
- We can't allow it.
- We can't allow it.

678
01:05:55,744 --> 01:05:58,662
- We can't allow it.
- We can't allow it.

679
01:05:58,747 --> 01:06:00,581
We have to protect the tribe.

680
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:04,501
What they've bred
won't be able to control its thirst.

681
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:06,503
Every human will be in danger.

682
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:08,881
- We're ready.
- No time to waste.

683
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,007
Now?

684
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:13,010
We must destroy it before it's born.

685
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:14,720
You mean, kill Bella?

686
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:17,473
Her choice affects us all.

687
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:20,809
Bella's human.
Our protection applies to her.

688
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:22,811
She's dying anyway!

689
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:29,526
We have real enemies to fight tonight.

690
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:31,028
Tonight?

691
01:06:33,073 --> 01:06:36,116
You will fight with us, Jake.

692
01:06:55,804 --> 01:07:00,015
l will not.

693
01:07:00,642 --> 01:07:04,895
I am the grandson of Ephraim Black.

694
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:07,940
I am the grandson of a chief!

695
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:13,028
I wasn't born to follow you, or anyone else.

696
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:46,937
Whoa.

697
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:52,526
Don't worry. They're not following us.

698
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:53,652
What do you think you're doing here?

699
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:56,488
-l left Sam's pack.
-Go home, Seth.

700
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:58,949
-l won't stand behind him.
-Oh, yes, you will.

701
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:02,035
I'm not kidding. Get out of here.

702
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:07,082
ls that an order?
Gonna make me bow down, too?

703
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:09,251
I'm not ordering anyone.

704
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:12,713
Look, I'm just going off
on my own here, okay?

705
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:15,048
Great, and I've got your back.

706
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:16,258
No, you don't.

707
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:21,597
If Sam comes after Bella,

708
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:24,725
are you really ready
to fight your own brothers?

709
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:26,059
Your sister?

710
01:08:27,187 --> 01:08:29,521
If it's the right thing to do.

711
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,693
Whatever.

712
01:08:35,695 --> 01:08:38,572
I'm gonna go give the Cullens a heads-up.

713
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:40,365
Do what you want.

714
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:49,082
How cool is this? Two-man pack.
Two against the world.

715
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:50,959
You're getting on my nerves, Seth.

716
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:53,796
I'll shut up. Can do.

717
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:00,010
Get ready.

718
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:02,304
They're coming for Bella.

719
01:09:04,766 --> 01:09:06,225
They're not gonna touch her.

720
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:07,518
Agreed.

721
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:16,610
Man, l can smell them
from all the way out here.

722
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:18,237
What the hell are you doing here?

723
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:20,697
I'm not gonna let my little brother
get himself killed.

724
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:23,116
Go away, Leah! l can take care of myself.

725
01:09:23,201 --> 01:09:25,494
That you think so
proves you need a babysitter.

726
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:26,787
Okay, would the both of you shut up?

727
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:30,916
Did Sam send you?

728
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,835
Sam doesn't even know l left.

729
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:40,175
l think he just figured it out.

730
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:42,719
Jake.

731
01:09:44,055 --> 01:09:45,764
l know what his plan is.

732
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,017
Sam's lost the element of surprise,

733
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:50,853
and he doesn't want
to take you on outnumbered,

734
01:09:50,937 --> 01:09:52,688
so he's not gonna come at you head on.

735
01:09:52,772 --> 01:09:55,858
He's got the place surrounded
and he'll wait for his opportunity.

736
01:09:55,942 --> 01:09:57,234
We won't get through without a fight.

737
01:09:57,318 --> 01:09:59,236
No fights.

738
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,654
We won't be the ones to break the treaty.

739
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:03,824
The treaty is void, at least in Sam's mind.

740
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:05,117
Not in ours.

741
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:08,245
Carlisle, no one's hunted for weeks.

742
01:10:09,873 --> 01:10:12,416
We'll make do.

743
01:10:14,794 --> 01:10:16,211
You've done us a great service, Jacob.

744
01:10:16,296 --> 01:10:17,796
Thank you.

745
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:53,332
l know they're out there somewhere,
but l can't hear them anymore.

746
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:56,627
It's so quiet.

747
01:10:58,171 --> 01:11:01,548
l stopped hearing them, too,
the second l decided to leave.

748
01:11:03,343 --> 01:11:05,385
It's nice.

749
01:11:07,305 --> 01:11:08,597
You know you can't stay here.

750
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:11,475
-But l don't have any place...
-l can't trust you with the Cullens.

751
01:11:11,559 --> 01:11:13,518
You hate them too much.

752
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:15,604
You don't even like me.

753
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:17,397
l don't have to.

754
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:20,859
l just have to follow you.

755
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:26,239
Look, Seth doesn't want you here.
Neither do l.

756
01:11:29,911 --> 01:11:33,080
Being unwanted isn't exactly
a new thing for me.

757
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,765
Look, I'll stay out of your way.

758
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:53,266
I'll do whatever you want,

759
01:11:53,351 --> 01:11:57,688
except go back to Sam's pack and be the
pathetic ex-girlfriend he can't get away from.

760
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:03,318
You don't know how many times
l wished l could imprint on someone.

761
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:05,153
Anyone.

762
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:09,783
Just to break the connection.

763
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:26,008
All right.

764
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:31,346
I'm gonna do a perimeter run.
You got my flank?

765
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:43,442
God and his priests and his kings

766
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:52,868
All will wait

767
01:12:52,952 --> 01:12:55,662
As they go on

768
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:00,459
Mmm-mmm

769
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:04,129
Held between heaven and hell

770
01:13:06,049 --> 01:13:10,719
As they're dancing

771
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:14,097
As they don't

772
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:34,826
Cold

773
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:48,924
Your rib is cracked.

774
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:54,262
But there are no splinters.
You haven't punctured anything.

775
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:56,515
-Yet.
-Edward.

776
01:13:58,643 --> 01:14:00,977
It's breaking her bones now.

777
01:14:02,188 --> 01:14:04,022
It's crushing you from the inside out.

778
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:09,820
Carlisle, tell her what you told me. Tell her.

779
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:15,325
Carlisle, tell me. It's all right.

780
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:28,213
The fetus isn't compatible with your body.

781
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:32,843
It's too strong.

782
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:35,387
lt won't allow you to get
the nutrition you need.

783
01:14:35,972 --> 01:14:37,305
It's starving you by the hour.

784
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:39,558
l can't stop it, and l can't slow it down.

785
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:45,522
At this rate, your heart will give out
before you can deliver.

786
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:52,112
Then I'll hold on as long as l can, and then...

787
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:54,156
Bella.

788
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,783
There are some conditions
that even venom can't overcome.

789
01:14:58,077 --> 01:14:59,077
You understand?

790
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:02,038
I'm sorry.

791
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:17,345
Edward, I'm sorry.

792
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:19,764
l can't live without you.

793
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:21,933
You won't. You're gonna have a part of me.

794
01:15:22,393 --> 01:15:23,518
He'll need you.

795
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:30,859
Do you honestly think that l could love it
or even tolerate it if it killed you?

796
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,277
It's not his fault.

797
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:35,197
You have to accept what is.

798
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:37,282
Because you've given me no choice!

799
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:40,827
Bella, we're supposed to be partners,
remember?

800
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:43,955
But you decided this on your own.

801
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,498
You've decided to leave me.

802
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:47,292
Don't see it that way.

803
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:49,127
Well, l have no other way to see it.

804
01:15:49,212 --> 01:15:50,545
'Cause it's me who'll lose you.

805
01:15:51,339 --> 01:15:52,464
And l don't choose that.

806
01:15:54,342 --> 01:15:56,134
l don't choose that.

807
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:25,121
Cold

808
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:32,337
Sing for the lion and lamb

809
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:37,884
Yours completely

810
01:16:37,969 --> 01:16:41,304
Yours

811
01:16:41,389 --> 01:16:44,724
As we go over

812
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:49,980
Sing for the lion and lamb

813
01:16:50,523 --> 01:16:52,023
Washington driving in the red zone.

814
01:16:52,108 --> 01:16:54,693
Almost stripped of the ball.
He stood up and Calvin finally...

815
01:16:57,571 --> 01:16:58,613
Are you cold?

816
01:16:59,699 --> 01:17:01,032
l got it.

817
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:09,541
Don't do that.

818
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:12,252
What?

819
01:17:12,712 --> 01:17:15,588
Smile like I'm your favorite person
in the world.

820
01:17:16,507 --> 01:17:18,008
You're one of them.

821
01:17:20,428 --> 01:17:23,013
Feels complete when you're here, Jake.

822
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:40,613
We need to find a way
to get some food into her system.

823
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:44,909
-If l could only see the fetus...
-The baby.

824
01:17:44,994 --> 01:17:47,287
...maybe l could figure out what it wants.

825
01:17:55,129 --> 01:17:57,213
Think you might be right.

826
01:17:57,298 --> 01:17:58,631
Jacob just had an idea.

827
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:04,471
lt wasn't an idea. lt was a snide comment.

828
01:18:04,555 --> 01:18:06,181
What were you thinking?

829
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:09,559
That it's probably just looking for someone
to sink its teeth into.

830
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:21,446
He's thirsty.

831
01:18:24,075 --> 01:18:25,533
l know the feeling.

832
01:18:26,994 --> 01:18:29,579
If it's craving,
it's not gonna want animal blood.

833
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:31,664
l have some O negative laid aside for Bella.

834
01:18:34,293 --> 01:18:35,752
Walk with me.

835
01:18:56,816 --> 01:18:57,857
Wait, wait, wait.

836
01:18:57,942 --> 01:18:59,359
You're gonna make her drink that?

837
01:18:59,944 --> 01:19:02,862
It's the fastest way to test the theory.

838
01:19:02,947 --> 01:19:04,489
Only if you're comfortable with it.

839
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:06,699
I'll try anything.

840
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,619
Just hold on.

841
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,164
l think I'm gonna be sick.

842
01:19:21,424 --> 01:19:23,341
This might make it a little easier to take.

843
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:55,415
Tastes

844
01:19:58,961 --> 01:20:00,003
good.

845
01:20:12,224 --> 01:20:13,725
Mmm.

846
01:20:23,277 --> 01:20:25,487
Your pulse is already getting stronger.

847
01:20:27,114 --> 01:20:28,698
It's working.

848
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:53,014
- Well, you sound better.
l am.

849
01:20:53,349 --> 01:20:54,682
l feel much better.

850
01:20:54,767 --> 01:20:57,727
This whole thing must've put a kink
in the honeymoon, huh?

851
01:20:59,313 --> 01:21:00,563
You could say that.

852
01:21:00,648 --> 01:21:03,608
Otherwise, married life treating you okay?

853
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:06,611
Edward still walks on water and all that?

854
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:09,656
Yeah, but, l mean, it is different now.

855
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:11,824
The important thing is that you're better.

856
01:21:11,909 --> 01:21:14,327
And that you're coming home soon, right?

857
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:17,247
Okay, Dad, l don't want you to freak out,

858
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:22,627
but I'm going to a medical center
in Switzerland.

859
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:25,338
What? No, no, you're not.
You're not going to Switzerland.

860
01:21:25,422 --> 01:21:26,839
What are you... You said you were better.

861
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:28,132
I am.

862
01:21:28,592 --> 01:21:30,885
No, Bella. I'm getting on a plane. No.

863
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:32,011
No.

864
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:36,724
It's really more of a spa.

865
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:40,937
And I'm sure that I'd be better
by the time you got there anyway.

866
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:43,147
Bells... l don't know.

867
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:44,607
Dad, don't come.

868
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:46,734
And picture me healthy,

869
01:21:46,819 --> 01:21:49,737
like I'm sitting on the couch with you,
eating pizza or something.

870
01:21:49,822 --> 01:21:51,823
You want me to visualize?

871
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:53,032
They say that it helps.

872
01:21:53,951 --> 01:21:55,994
Just picture me like that.

873
01:21:57,830 --> 01:21:59,414
Like l was.

874
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:01,541
It'll make me feel better.

875
01:22:03,127 --> 01:22:04,586
Dad, l got to go, okay?

876
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:05,837
Bella.

877
01:22:06,422 --> 01:22:07,422
l love you.

878
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:08,881
Bella...

879
01:22:29,028 --> 01:22:31,279
I'm sorry I've been so angry.

880
01:22:32,615 --> 01:22:34,198
l would be, too.

881
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:37,076
I've left you alone in this.

882
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:44,292
Marriage.

883
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,924
Well, they say the first year is the hardest.

884
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:58,890
Who was that?

885
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:00,475
What?

886
01:23:00,559 --> 01:23:02,060
l thought l just heard...

887
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:04,979
Just say something else.

888
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:07,565
Like what?

889
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:12,236
Edward, what's going on?

890
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:16,366
He likes the sound of your voice.

891
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:18,201
You can hear him?

892
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:19,952
In mind.

893
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:25,917
He likes my voice as well.

894
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:27,085
What?

895
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:29,420
What do you hear?

896
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:31,839
It's so strange.

897
01:23:31,924 --> 01:23:34,967
l thought he was like me, but he's not.
He's like you.

898
01:23:35,386 --> 01:23:38,179
Good and pure.

899
01:23:38,889 --> 01:23:40,556
He's happy.

900
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:45,311
Of course you are.

901
01:23:45,396 --> 01:23:48,106
Of course you're happy.
How could you not be?

902
01:23:49,066 --> 01:23:51,317
l love you so much.

903
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:54,946
What do you hear now?

904
01:23:55,406 --> 01:23:56,989
He loves you, Bella.

905
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:00,743
Oh, my gosh.

906
01:24:34,445 --> 01:24:35,862
Jacob.

907
01:24:45,831 --> 01:24:47,248
So, that's the last of it?

908
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:49,292
Bella could deliver as early as tomorrow.

909
01:24:49,376 --> 01:24:51,544
If she's going to have any chance at all,
she'll need more blood.

910
01:24:51,628 --> 01:24:53,087
And you need to feed.

911
01:24:53,172 --> 01:24:55,798
You have to be at your strongest for her.
We need to go tonight.

912
01:24:56,175 --> 01:24:58,634
Carlisle, you're the enemy now.

913
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:01,262
Sam won't hesitate. You will be slaughtered.

914
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:03,139
Emmett will come with us.

915
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:05,641
- That won't be enough.
- We have no choice, Jacob.

916
01:25:05,726 --> 01:25:08,269
If there's anything we can do to save her,
we have to try.

917
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:11,939
-You'd risk your lives for her?
-Of course we would.

918
01:25:12,024 --> 01:25:13,691
Bella's a part of our family now.

919
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:16,652
Yeah.

920
01:25:17,863 --> 01:25:19,405
l can see that.

921
01:25:20,908 --> 01:25:22,700
This really is a family.

922
01:25:26,205 --> 01:25:28,956
As strong as the one l was born into.

923
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:33,127
l know what l have to do.

924
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,609
Jake! They're coming.

925
01:25:56,693 --> 01:25:57,777
l know.

926
01:25:57,861 --> 01:26:00,571
We should phase, Jacob.
We can't protect ourselves like this.

927
01:26:00,656 --> 01:26:02,657
They'll see it as a threat.

928
01:26:03,075 --> 01:26:04,742
l wanna talk!

929
01:26:05,369 --> 01:26:07,245
Be easier if l could hear you, too.

930
01:26:16,839 --> 01:26:18,256
This isn't your territory anymore.

931
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:22,093
-How's the new family working out?
-You done?

932
01:26:23,971 --> 01:26:25,263
You coming home, Jake?

933
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:27,849
Not until l finish this.

934
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:29,267
What do you mean?

935
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:31,644
l want Sam to take back Leah and Seth.

936
01:26:31,728 --> 01:26:33,396
- What?
- No way!

937
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:34,522
Quiet!

938
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:38,109
l want them safe.

939
01:26:38,902 --> 01:26:40,611
And l want this over.

940
01:26:51,623 --> 01:26:54,792
l need Sam to wait until Bella's
been separated from the problem.

941
01:26:54,877 --> 01:26:56,127
You mean till she's dead.

942
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:57,295
Ease up, Paul.

943
01:26:58,714 --> 01:26:59,755
Then what?

944
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:04,719
Tell Sam that when the moment comes,
I'll be the one to destroy it.

945
01:27:04,803 --> 01:27:06,012
Jake!

946
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:09,307
I'm the only one who can.

947
01:27:10,392 --> 01:27:11,642
They trust me.

948
01:28:09,368 --> 01:28:10,618
You played us?

949
01:28:26,009 --> 01:28:28,344
Can't we come up with something
just a little more classic?

950
01:28:32,557 --> 01:28:33,724
Thank you.

951
01:28:34,726 --> 01:28:36,811
-They make it out all right?
-Yeah.

952
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:38,187
Good.

953
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:48,781
Hey.

954
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:52,034
Are you okay?

955
01:28:52,119 --> 01:28:54,245
Yeah, it's not like I'm the one
carrying a demon.

956
01:28:55,414 --> 01:28:57,707
This is pretty important, Bella.

957
01:28:57,791 --> 01:28:59,834
Why don't you tell Jacob
what you've decided?

958
01:29:00,293 --> 01:29:01,419
What now?

959
01:29:03,296 --> 01:29:05,756
Rose is trying to talk Bella
out of her baby names.

960
01:29:06,383 --> 01:29:07,758
She hates them.

961
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:10,428
Well, then I'm on your side
no matter what you picked.

962
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,888
They're not that bad.

963
01:29:12,973 --> 01:29:14,640
If it's a boy, EJ.

964
01:29:16,435 --> 01:29:17,476
Edward Jacob.

965
01:29:20,063 --> 01:29:22,606
Okay, fine, that one's not awful.

966
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:26,444
Why don't you tell him the girl's name?

967
01:29:27,404 --> 01:29:30,406
l was playing around with our moms' names.

968
01:29:31,033 --> 01:29:32,366
Renée and Esme.

969
01:29:32,451 --> 01:29:33,784
And l was thinking...

970
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:42,334
Renesmee.

971
01:29:46,089 --> 01:29:47,423
Too weird?

972
01:29:49,551 --> 01:29:50,801
No, that's not too weird.

973
01:29:52,471 --> 01:29:53,512
It's beautiful.

974
01:29:54,723 --> 01:29:58,601
And it's unique,
which certainly fits the situation.

975
01:30:01,188 --> 01:30:02,605
l like Renesmee.

976
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:08,944
He likes it.

977
01:30:30,884 --> 01:30:33,469
Rosalie, pass the morphine.

978
01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:37,348
Carlisle said the placenta
must have detached.

979
01:30:39,935 --> 01:30:42,478
-He's coming as fast as he can, but...
-We'll have to do it.

980
01:30:45,482 --> 01:30:48,275
Rose! Let the morphine spread.

981
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:50,027
There's no time. He's dying.

982
01:30:50,737 --> 01:30:52,071
Get him out now!

983
01:30:53,698 --> 01:30:54,698
Look at me, Bella.

984
01:31:03,542 --> 01:31:04,834
Rosalie, don't!

985
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:07,294
Alice, get her out of here!

986
01:31:07,379 --> 01:31:09,421
Rosalie!

987
01:31:11,383 --> 01:31:12,716
Ow!

988
01:31:12,801 --> 01:31:14,135
Save her! You've got to change her!

989
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:15,386
l can't, not whilst he's still in there.

990
01:31:15,804 --> 01:31:16,929
l got to get him out first.

991
01:31:18,098 --> 01:31:21,016
Stay, Bella. Stay focused.
Keep your heart beating.

992
01:31:21,101 --> 01:31:22,935
No! He's suffocating!

993
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:38,450
Okay.

994
01:31:59,181 --> 01:32:00,764
Hey.

995
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:02,266
Hey, hey.

996
01:32:03,852 --> 01:32:05,102
It's Renesmee.

997
01:32:14,654 --> 01:32:16,697
You're beautiful.

998
01:32:39,930 --> 01:32:41,180
Hey.

999
01:32:54,903 --> 01:32:56,570
Bella?

1000
01:32:56,947 --> 01:32:58,155
Bella?

1001
01:32:59,658 --> 01:33:01,408
Bella!

1002
01:33:07,916 --> 01:33:08,958
Jacob, take the baby.

1003
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:11,252
Keep that away from me!

1004
01:33:11,336 --> 01:33:12,920
Edward.

1005
01:33:13,338 --> 01:33:14,838
I'll take her.

1006
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:18,092
l promise I'm okay. Let me.

1007
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:27,017
What is that?

1008
01:33:31,564 --> 01:33:32,648
It's my venom.

1009
01:33:45,704 --> 01:33:48,038
You're okay.

1010
01:33:50,792 --> 01:33:52,042
Come on.

1011
01:33:59,968 --> 01:34:01,635
It's supposed to be working.

1012
01:34:03,596 --> 01:34:04,888
Oh, my God.

1013
01:34:05,181 --> 01:34:06,390
Come on.

1014
01:34:07,934 --> 01:34:09,977
Bella, come on.

1015
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:17,359
l won't kill you.

1016
01:34:17,444 --> 01:34:19,653
That'd be too easy.

1017
01:34:19,738 --> 01:34:22,448
You deserve to live with this.

1018
01:34:57,734 --> 01:34:58,942
She didn't make it.

1019
01:35:13,625 --> 01:35:15,918
You're not dead. You're not dead.

1020
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:21,799
Come on!

1021
01:35:29,307 --> 01:35:32,184
No, it will work. lt will work.

1022
01:35:32,769 --> 01:35:34,978
Please, please, please, please.

1023
01:36:20,191 --> 01:36:22,276
Come back to me, please, baby.

1024
01:36:22,861 --> 01:36:25,195
Bella, Bella, please, please.

1025
01:36:34,038 --> 01:36:36,165
Hi, hi.

1026
01:36:56,269 --> 01:36:58,395
l don't care what he's done.

1027
01:36:59,022 --> 01:37:01,857
-He's still my son.
-I'm sorry, Billy.

1028
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:03,901
l just thought you should know.

1029
01:37:10,074 --> 01:37:11,241
Bella's dead.

1030
01:37:12,827 --> 01:37:14,161
lt killed her.

1031
01:37:17,248 --> 01:37:19,249
Let's go!

1032
01:38:07,465 --> 01:38:10,634
It's like gravity.

1033
01:38:11,511 --> 01:38:13,929
Your whole center shifts.

1034
01:38:16,474 --> 01:38:19,184
Suddenly, it's not the Earth
holding you here.

1035
01:38:20,395 --> 01:38:25,065
You would do anything,
be anything she needs.

1036
01:38:27,277 --> 01:38:30,654
A friend, a brother.

1037
01:38:32,156 --> 01:38:33,490
A protector.

1038
01:38:54,596 --> 01:38:57,222
Alice! Jasper!

1039
01:39:02,895 --> 01:39:05,022
You're gonna be all right.

1040
01:39:18,119 --> 01:39:19,786
-We're outnumbered.
-By a lot.

1041
01:39:19,871 --> 01:39:21,705
l won't let them hurt my family.

1042
01:40:39,575 --> 01:40:41,451
Stop! It's over!

1043
01:40:42,954 --> 01:40:44,705
If you kill her, you kill me.

1044
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:00,887
Jacob imprinted.

1045
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:07,352
They can't hurt her.

1046
01:41:08,521 --> 01:41:12,107
Whoever a wolf imprints on can't be harmed.

1047
01:41:16,404 --> 01:41:19,156
It's their most absolute law.

1048
01:41:55,067 --> 01:41:58,111
She shouldn't be this still.

1049
01:41:58,196 --> 01:41:59,446
It's the morphine.

1050
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:03,784
- Maybe l was too late.
- No, Edward.

1051
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:06,453
Listen to her heart.

1052
01:45:10,054 --> 01:45:12,806
Sitting pretty uptightly

1053
01:45:12,890 --> 01:45:16,601
The knots keep you at my side

1054
01:45:16,686 --> 01:45:19,813
Upstairs, in corners

1055
01:45:19,897 --> 01:45:22,691
Eyes blink for the crawl

1056
01:45:22,775 --> 01:45:28,196
Up and out
My beacon will choke

1057
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:32,826
If yours is taken
I dare four more lines

1058
01:45:32,910 --> 01:45:36,037
Four more lines

1059
01:45:36,831 --> 01:45:46,840
Sellotape an end to

1060
01:45:46,924 --> 01:45:50,051
Sellotape an end

1061
01:45:50,136 --> 01:45:53,888
Hover thought
Mosquito

1062
01:45:53,973 --> 01:45:55,682
Bite down

1063
01:45:55,766 --> 01:46:00,437
My fickle hands machine
Surprises

1064
01:46:00,813 --> 01:46:07,485
Sellotape an end to a story that is hanging

1065
01:46:07,778 --> 01:46:12,824
Over silence always wasted

1066
01:46:12,908 --> 01:46:16,202
Swells with every teardrop

1067
01:46:16,287 --> 01:46:19,622
Pulls my threads to kid gloves

1068
01:46:19,707 --> 01:46:23,668
Sellotape an end to this

1069
01:47:03,459 --> 01:47:06,461
Now I'm the guilty one

1070
01:47:07,963 --> 01:47:09,214
Hey!

1071
01:47:09,298 --> 01:47:11,883
Give me my sentence

1072
01:47:11,967 --> 01:47:14,344
I'll pay my penance

1073
01:47:14,428 --> 01:47:16,596
Let me kill them all

1074
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:20,350
And the pain I have for hurting you

1075
01:47:20,434 --> 01:47:25,188
I didn't mean it

1076
01:47:28,192 --> 01:47:29,651
Ah. It's from Carlisle.

1077
01:47:31,195 --> 01:47:36,658
Which is spelt with an "S," Sweet Bianca.

1078
01:47:42,123 --> 01:47:45,458
He's added a new member to his coven.

1079
01:47:45,543 --> 01:47:46,626
Ah.

1080
01:47:46,710 --> 01:47:49,129
Increasing his power.

1081
01:47:58,055 --> 01:48:00,056
First it's the spelling,

1082
01:48:00,808 --> 01:48:02,433
then the grammar.

1083
01:48:05,062 --> 01:48:09,816
At least our dispute with the Cullens is over.

1084
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:12,694
-Over?
-Mmm.

1085
01:48:12,778 --> 01:48:13,987
Goodness, no.

1086
01:48:15,406 --> 01:48:20,368
Our dispute goes far beyond
the fate of a mere human.

1087
01:48:21,704 --> 01:48:23,079
And what might it be?

1088
01:48:23,581 --> 01:48:26,374
Why, brother, l thought you understood.

1089
01:48:28,252 --> 01:48:30,503
They have something l want.

1090
01:48:36,427 --> 01:48:39,804
If you ever leave me, baby

1091
01:48:42,808 --> 01:48:45,935
Leave some morphine at my door

1092
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:54,110
'Cause it would take
a whole lot of medication

1093
01:48:55,029 --> 01:49:01,784
To realize what we used to have,
we don't have it anymore

1094
01:49:01,869 --> 01:49:05,622
There's no religion that could save me

1095
01:49:07,791 --> 01:49:11,794
No matter how long
my knees are on the floor

1096
01:49:14,215 --> 01:49:18,760
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm making

1097
01:49:20,429 --> 01:49:26,226
Will keep you by my side
Will keep you from walking out the door

1098
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:29,896
'Cause there'll be no sunlight

1099
01:49:29,980 --> 01:49:33,066
If I lose you, baby

1100
01:49:33,150 --> 01:49:36,027
There'll be no clear skies

1101
01:49:36,111 --> 01:49:39,364
If I lose you, baby

1102
01:49:39,448 --> 01:49:44,994
Just like the clouds,
my eyes will do the same

1103
01:49:45,079 --> 01:49:47,747
If you walk away

1104
01:49:47,831 --> 01:49:53,169
Every day it will rain, rain, rain

1105
01:50:08,894 --> 01:50:12,855
I'll never be your mother's favorite

1106
01:50:14,858 --> 01:50:18,528
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye

1107
01:50:21,532 --> 01:50:27,412
If I was in their shoes,
I'd be doing the same thing

1108
01:50:27,496 --> 01:50:29,872
Saying there goes my little girl

1109
01:50:29,957 --> 01:50:33,376
Walking with that troublesome guy

1110
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:38,715
But they're just afraid
of something they can't understand

1111
01:50:40,592 --> 01:50:44,512
But little darling,
watch me change their minds

1112
01:50:45,472 --> 01:50:50,310
Yeah, for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try

1113
01:50:52,229 --> 01:50:56,149
I'll pick up these broken pieces
till I'm bleeding

1114
01:50:56,233 --> 01:50:59,152
If that'll make you mine

1115
01:50:59,236 --> 01:51:02,613
'Cause there'll be no sunlight

1116
01:51:02,698 --> 01:51:05,992
If I lose you, baby

1117
01:51:06,076 --> 01:51:08,995
There'll be no clear skies

1118
01:51:09,079 --> 01:51:12,165
If I lose you, baby

1119
01:51:12,249 --> 01:51:17,712
Just like the clouds,
my eyes will do the same

1120
01:51:17,796 --> 01:51:20,631
If you walk away

1121
01:51:20,716 --> 01:51:25,928
Every day it will rain, rain, rain

1122
01:51:40,027 --> 01:51:51,454
Don't just say goodbye

1123
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:56,959
I'll pick up these broken pieces
till I'm bleeding

1124
01:51:57,044 --> 01:51:59,545
If that'll make it right

1125
01:52:00,255 --> 01:52:03,549
'Cause there'll be no sunlight

1126
01:52:03,634 --> 01:52:06,636
If I lose you, baby

1127
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:10,014
There'll be no clear skies

1128
01:52:10,099 --> 01:52:13,017
If I lose you, baby

1129
01:52:13,102 --> 01:52:18,523
Just like the clouds,
my eyes will do the same

1130
01:52:18,607 --> 01:52:21,401
If you walk away

1131
01:52:21,485 --> 01:52:26,364
Every day it will rain, rain, rain

1132
01:53:02,526 --> 01:53:06,446
Heart beats fast

1133
01:53:06,530 --> 01:53:11,534
Colors and promises

1134
01:53:11,618 --> 01:53:14,162
How to be brave

1135
01:53:14,246 --> 01:53:19,292
How can I love when I'm afraid

1136
01:53:19,376 --> 01:53:21,752
To fall

1137
01:53:21,837 --> 01:53:26,966
But watching you stand alone

1138
01:53:27,050 --> 01:53:29,093
All of my doubt

1139
01:53:29,178 --> 01:53:34,557
Suddenly goes away somehow

1140
01:53:35,934 --> 01:53:40,229
One step closer

1141
01:53:43,775 --> 01:53:48,988
I have died every day waiting for you

1142
01:53:49,072 --> 01:53:53,701
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you

1143
01:53:53,785 --> 01:53:57,872
For a thousand years

1144
01:53:57,956 --> 01:54:03,211
I'll love you for a thousand more

1145
01:54:09,801 --> 01:54:13,429
Time stands still

1146
01:54:13,514 --> 01:54:18,684
Beauty in all she is

1147
01:54:18,769 --> 01:54:21,229
I will be brave

1148
01:54:21,313 --> 01:54:27,485
I will not let anything take away

1149
01:54:29,071 --> 01:54:33,908
What's standing in front of me

1150
01:54:33,992 --> 01:54:36,702
Every breath

1151
01:54:36,787 --> 01:54:41,123
Every hour has come to this

1152
01:54:43,126 --> 01:54:48,297
One step closer

1153
01:54:50,968 --> 01:54:56,013
I have died every day waiting for you

1154
01:54:56,098 --> 01:55:00,726
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you

1155
01:55:00,811 --> 01:55:04,981
For a thousand years

1156
01:55:05,065 --> 01:55:10,820
I'll love you for a thousand more

1157
01:55:11,738 --> 01:55:16,909
And all along I believed I would find you

1158
01:55:16,994 --> 01:55:21,706
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you

1159
01:55:21,790 --> 01:55:25,835
For a thousand years

1160
01:55:25,919 --> 01:55:31,007
I'll love you for a thousand more

1161
01:55:55,824 --> 01:56:10,379
One step closer

1162
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:18,929
I have died every day waiting for you

1163
01:56:19,014 --> 01:56:23,851
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you

1164
01:56:23,935 --> 01:56:27,855
For a thousand years

1165
01:56:27,939 --> 01:56:32,568
I'll love you for a thousand more

1166
01:56:34,696 --> 01:56:39,825
And all along I believed I would find you

1167
01:56:39,910 --> 01:56:44,538
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you

1168
01:56:44,623 --> 01:56:48,751
For a thousand years

1169
01:56:48,835 --> 01:56:54,048
I'll love you for a thousand more
