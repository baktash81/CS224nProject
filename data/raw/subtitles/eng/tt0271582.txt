162
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,168
I have a commission for you.
Hmm. Come on in.

163
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:09,274
You live here? I do.

164
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:12,278
What do you do when it rains?
Well, it hasn't rained.

165
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:19,484
I would like you to make a
figure of the apostle Peter.

166
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:23,688
Now, Peter was not only the
chosen leader of the apostles,

167
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:28,427
he was established by Jesus as
the foundation of the church.

168
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,999
- I know Peter.
- Good.

169
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,563
- I know Peter.
- Good.

170
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:36,435
Now-- now, I'm looking for
something-- oh, how shall I say--

171
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,304
Expressive of you.

172
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:44,476
- Expressive of my faith.
<i>- Uh, excuse me, Joshua,</i>

173
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:46,545
there's a hole over your bed.

174
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:50,048
- Father pat.
- Oh, sorry.

175
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,217
Now, for material,

176
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:55,153
I was thinking that
we might use--

177
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:59,999
- Ash.
- Ash. Yes. Ash.

178
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,880
- Ash.
- Ash. Yes. Ash.

179
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:07,466
- That's what I was thinking.
- Yeah.

180
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:11,603
All right. Thanks, Joshua. I'm sure it's
gonna be great. <i>You guys take care.</i>

181
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:14,072
He seems like a nice guy.
Yeah, maybe.

182
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:17,242
He's an artist. They can
be temperamental. Yeah.

183
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:20,612
When I--
When I was in Rome last summer,

184
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:23,682
I had an audience
with cardinal riccardo.

185
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:27,986
Uh-oh. He told this interesting
story about Michelangelo.

186
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,999
It seems that when he was given
his commission, he hit the stone,

187
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,123
it seems that when he was given
his commission, he hit the stone,

188
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:36,195
and sure enough, the wrong statue
came out of the stone. My goodness.

189
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,264
<i>He began with the simple act of working
on something that needed doing.</i>

190
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:18,070
<i>It looked like something we all needed,
but, boy, did it cause a lot of trouble.</i>

191
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:23,341
I saw Joshua rebuilding the
baptist church this morning.

192
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,977
Rebuilding the baptist church?
I thought he was an artist.

193
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,113
Looked more
like a lumberjack today.

194
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:29,999
Well, I hope he allows time
to finish our statue.

195
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,417
Well, I hope he allows time
to finish our statue.

196
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,987
Theo was out there with him.

197
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:40,525
Theo? How many others
were there?

198
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:43,495
It was just Theo. Hmm.

199
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:47,699
Interesting man, this Joshua. He can't
expect to do all that work by himself.

200
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,168
He'll need other people
to help him.

201
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:53,238
Oh, I think he'll find them.
People really seem to like him.

202
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:58,143
Really? Is there anything about
this Joshua that strikes you...

203
00:17:58,144 --> 00:17:59,999
As peculiar?

204
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,112
As peculiar?

205
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:04,249
I have a brother who's peculiar.
Joshua isn't anything like him.

206
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:10,289
- Still, he's different.
- He's very different.

207
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:19,364
You stuck? No, it's just a fuse thing.
It happens all the time.

208
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:23,034
I think I got it. Uh-huh.

209
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:27,272
Well, it's the stranger.
The stranger?

210
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,999
Anyone who's lived here less
than 15 years is a stranger.

211
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,676
Anyone who's lived here less

No. Money-back guarantee. It has a special
sonar sound that naturally attracts fish.

All right. Good evening,
and welcome to lost and found.

500
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:10,420
This is a church service?

501
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:13,023
One man's concert's
another man's service.

502
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:16,260
As some of you
may or may not know,

503
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:20,597
one of the guitarists in
the band, Kevin zunbar,

504
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:25,336
is actually the newest member of
the lost and found congregation.

505
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:28,339
Whoo!

506
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:34,746
Thank you. I-I--

507
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:43,320
<i>There was a long time
where I felt a bit... lonely,</i>

508
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,557
I guess, and angry.

509
00:38:46,558 --> 00:38:52,129
And, I mean, it was like I was
missing something in my life,

510
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:55,065
but I couldn't figure out
what that something was.

511
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:59,999
<i>And I've realized
that it was god...</i>

512
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,004
<i>And I've realized
that it was god...</i>

513
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:03,340
- Who I was needing...
<i>- Yeah. All right.</i>

514
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:08,345
And that all I needed to do
was open my heart up...

515
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,348
And ask him
to be a part of my life.

516
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,718
<i>Yeah!</i> And I did. I did.

517
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:19,022
So the music we play tonight
is for you...

518
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,625

about three men...</i>

531
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:29,999
Looking over A priest,

532
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,094
looking over A priest,

533
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,430
<i>an artist and a cowboy.</i>

534
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:38,535
And the priest says, "what a
beautiful work god has created."

535
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:44,408
The artist says,
"what magnificent colors."

536
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:49,480
And the cowboy says, "boy, what
a lousy place to lose a horse."

537
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,999
Well, uh, I think
the point I'm trying to make...

538
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,425
Well, uh, I think
the point I'm trying to make...

539
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:05,095
Is that we're all individuals,
and as individuals,

540
00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:09,734
there is more than one way to look
at the same thing, even the church.

541
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:20,277
Don't ever give a sermon like
that in my church again.

542
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:25,582
The pulpit is not a place for jokes, nor
is it a place to express individual ideas.

543
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:28,518
I was trying to show how we're
all connected to each other.

544
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:29,999
I will not allow you to express alternative
points of view regarding the church.

545
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,056
I will not allow you to express alternative
points of view regarding the church.

Now, brothers and sisters, what you
gonna experience here tonight...

564
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,104
Is the wonderful, glorious healing power
of our savior, lord Jesus Christ.

565
00:42:54,105 --> 00:42:57,707
- All right, now.
- Who wants to be saved?

566
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:59,999
Let me see your hands. Let me see your hands.
Who would like to feel the spirit of god...

<i>Reach in and touch you here
this evening, glory be?</i>

569
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:09,152
You, child, and you, brother.
You, my sister.

570
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:12,355
- What is your name, child?
- Sally Baker.

571
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:16,259
Do you believe that god
loves you, Sally? Yes.

572
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:21,298
And do you believe that through the healing power
of Jesus that you'll be healed here tonight?

573
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:25,235
- Yes, I do.
- <i>Oh, then I say...</i>

574
00:43:25,236 --> 00:43:29,139
Let his spirit fill you
and make you whole!

575

Amen! Yes! Praise god.

<i>Praise god. Hallelujah.
Thank you, Jesus!</i>

00:43:37,582 --> 00:43:40,351
I can walk. Thank you.

579
00:43:41,419 --> 00:43:45,489
<i>Jesus, thank you. I can walk.</i>

580
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:49,292
Whoo! Yes, lord! Yes, lord!
Now, now, brothers and sisters,

581
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,429
brothers and sisters, just a
quiet moment, if you will.

582
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:56,666
Quiet moment. Before
I ask for your help,

583
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:59,999
I feel we should take a moment
and think about what we've seen.

584
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,138
I feel we should take a moment
and think about what we've seen.

585
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:04,441
Reflect on it. Think about it.
Pray about it.

586
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:08,612
- Let god put it on your heart.
<i>- Amen. Amen.</i>

587
00:44:08,613 --> 00:44:11,249
Let us pray.

588
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:19,323
You don't have to do this.

589
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:23,593
We're prayin' here, sir.

590
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,729
No, you're not.

591
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:29,999
This meeting isn't about prayer.
It's not about healing.

592
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,334
This meeting isn't about prayer.
It's not about healing.

593
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:34,539
You're not seeing what happened
here tonight. <i>Yeah, I saw it.</i>

594
00:44:36,374 --> 00:44:40,077
You and I saw the same thing.

595
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:44,714
You know, you don't
have to do it this way.

596
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:49,153
I know you'd like to have the
faith to talk to these people.

597
00:44:51,656 --> 00:44:54,625
But you don't know
what faith is.

598
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:05,603
She knows. She understands.

599
00:45:11,342 --> 00:45:15,313
I know what's in your heart.

600
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:23,988
I know.

601
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:08,031
I can see.

602
00:46:08,032 --> 00:46:11,736

A miracle! A miracle.

621
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:29,999
A miracle.

00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,980
A miracle.

Aaron, you're Jewish.
What are you doing here?

624
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:37,621
I thought someone
should tell you.

<i>Father tardone. Have
you heard the news?</i>

626
00:47:46,664 --> 00:47:52,602
Father pat, before you start espousing yet
another miracle, I advise you to take a breath.

627
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:56,473
Look-- take a breath. Choose
your words carefully.

628
00:47:56,474 --> 00:47:59,743
The lord is with us.
Of course he's with us.

629
00:47:59,744 --> 00:48:00,000
Oh, no, no. He is with us here in auburn.
Yes, pat, he's with us here.

630
00:48:00,001 --> 00:48:03,513
Oh, no, no. He is with us here in auburn.
Yes, pat, he's with us here.

631
00:48:03,514 --> 00:48:05,982
And I know where he lives.
Oh, don't say it.

632
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:08,752
The people from the revival of angels
meeting are all talking about it.

633
00:48:08,753 --> 00:48:13,123
Joshua went to their tent last night and
healed a blind girl with his own hands.

634
00:48:13,124 --> 00:48:15,525
Another miracle. A revival tent?

635
00:48:15,526 --> 00:48:17,594
That's right. A miracle
in a revival tent?

636
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:19,996
That is right. I warned
you about this Joshua.

637
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:22,966
Hey, I'm not the only one.
Everyone says it's a miracle.

638
00:48:22,967 --> 00:48:26,236
What kind of priest is he
turning you into, Patrick?

639
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:29,999
I have kept my eyes open and my
vision clear, like you advised me to,

640
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,374
I have kept my eyes open and my
vision clear, like you advised me to,

641
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:32,642
and I have been seeing things.

642
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:36,212
Yes, but you're not
seeing the truth.

643
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:39,549
Joshua is a fraud, and you're a
fool to be corrupted by him.

644
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:44,154
Corrupted? No one's been corrupted.
Joshua's the genuine article.

645
00:48:44,155 --> 00:48:48,292
Beware of false prophets.

646
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:54,298
As soon as this Joshua completes the statue,
I want you to end your association with him.

647
00:48:57,668 --> 00:48:59,999
He's my friend.

648
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,600
He's my friend.

649
00:49:02,006 --> 00:49:05,241
Do you understand me,
father Hayes?

650
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:08,312
I understand what you're saying.

651
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:35,172
Good morning. Good morning.

652
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,755
Father tardone.

653
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:56,459
Good morning, bishop.
Thank you for seeing me.

654
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,329
I'll get right to the point.

655
00:49:59,330 --> 00:49:59,999
A young man recently moved into our area.
He seemed simple enough,

656
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,068
a young man recently moved into our area.
He seemed simple enough,

657
00:50:05,069 --> 00:50:09,506
but he's shown a powerful influence
over a great many people.

658
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:13,142
They think he's capable
of performing miracles.

659
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:16,079
The protestant clergy
and I would like...

660
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,482
To call a meeting
of all the clergy in auburn.

661
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:24,153
And the purpose of this meeting would
be to investigate these miracles?

662
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:28,658
Oh, no, no. We all have better
things to do with our time.

663
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:29,999
That I'm glad to hear.

664
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,361
That I'm glad to hear.

665
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:34,397
However, bishop,

666
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:39,536
when a man uses such talk of miracles
for his own gain-- for his own cult--

667
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:44,307
- This Joshua has done this?
- He lets others do it for him.

668
00:50:44,308 --> 00:50:48,077
Still, it's not as if this man
were a priest saying these things.

669
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:52,382
He's just a man, and he's free
to do and say as he wishes.

670
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:56,052
But, bishop, what he says
and does is disruptive.

671
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:59,289
My own father Hayes follows
him around like a lost puppy.

672
00:50:59,290 --> 00:50:59,999
This is a small fire,
father tardone.

673
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,327
This is a small fire,
father tardone.

674
00:51:04,328 --> 00:51:07,196
You don't need a meeting.

675
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:10,634
You need
to put out your own fires.

676
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:52,475
<i>Father tardone, hello.</i>

677
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:55,278
How are you?

678
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:59,450
I was hoping the statue of Peter was done.
You're in luck.

679
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:06,290
Father, meet Peter.

680
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:11,495
- I'll send someone by to pick it up.
- You're not pleased.

681
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:19,068
- The statue is fine.
- It's the artist you have a problem with.

682
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:22,038
I made a mistake
hiring you, Joshua.

683
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:27,244
I'm surprised you found time to finish your
work, considering all your other chores.

684
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:29,999
I suppose I don't think of them as chores.
You know, father,

685
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,516
I suppose I don't think of them as chores.
You know, father,

686
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:37,186
we could use your help
down at the baptist church.

687
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:40,724
<i>Why don't you come down
and join us?</i>

688
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:43,726
Join you?

689
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:46,063
Join you?

690
00:52:48,065 --> 00:52:51,167
I know exactly what
you're up to, Joshua.

691
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:54,505
It's the others
whose eyes are not open.

692
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:59,275
Father, their eyes are wide open.
To what?

693
00:52:59,276 --> 00:52:59,999
A miracle worker? I have
never made that claim.

694
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,046
A miracle worker? I have
never made that claim.

695
00:53:03,047 --> 00:53:09,086
No, you would never say that,
because we both know it's not true.

696
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:14,158
And I think it's time for
everyone else to find out.

697
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:29,999
Well, look what they've done.
It looks very nice.

698
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,441
Well, look what they've done.
It looks very nice.

699
00:53:31,442 --> 00:53:35,978
Yes, they've definitely made progress.
We'll see the truth.

700
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:38,048
Yes, yes.

701
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:42,518
<i>Father pat.</i>

702
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:46,456
Well, Joshua, I see you've
gathered your followers.

703
00:53:46,457 --> 00:53:51,260
I know most of you. Some of you
are even part of my parish,

704
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:55,565
<i>and I'm glad to see you here,
because I think...</i>

705
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:59,602
What Joshua has persuaded you to
do with this church is wonderful.

706
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:00,000
<i>But I want you all to look...</i>

707
00:54:00,001 --> 00:54:03,473
<i>But I want you all to look...</i>

708
00:54:03,474 --> 00:54:08,077
At this wonderful man
and ask yourselves,

709
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:12,215
"does anyone do something
for nothing?"

710
00:54:12,216 --> 00:54:18,020
Does a complete stranger offer to help
without wanting something in return?

711
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:22,593
Father tardone-- shall I tell them
what you're really preaching, Joshua?

712
00:54:24,695 --> 00:54:29,465
- Preaching?
- You all know this book.

713
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:29,999
It is the word of god.

714
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,536
It is the word of god.

715
00:54:33,537 --> 00:54:38,674
Joshua, you once told me you don't fear
god. I don't think you know what this is.

716
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:42,011
It's a love letter.

717
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:44,480
- A love letter?
- Yeah.

718
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:47,550
Isn't that the Bible's main
message, that god loves you?

719
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,987
What about sin and god's law?

720
00:54:50,988 --> 00:54:54,991
<i>You're not an ordained minister. How
dare you assume the role of the clergy?</i>

721
00:54:54,992 --> 00:54:59,195
Wait a minute. That-that-that's
not what's happening here.

722
00:54:59,196 --> 00:54:59,999
What Joshua has done
is a miracle.

723
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,465
What Joshua has done
is a miracle.

724
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:05,701
<i>Living next to each other didn't make
us neighbors. It certainly didn't...</i>

725
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:08,471
Make us care about
one another, did it?

726
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:12,074
<i>But by working together
here with Joshua--</i>

727
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:15,578
Look around you. We have become
a community. <i>His community.</i>

728
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:19,182
Led by him. This is how it starts.
I have seen it before.

729
00:55:19,183 --> 00:55:23,286
<i>Come on. You don't really believe
he's gonna start some kind of cult?</i>

730
00:55:23,287 --> 00:55:25,321
I do. He's a terrible threat.

731
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:29,358
If you are still so blinded by
your fear that you can't...

732
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:29,999
See the good in this man--

733
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,495
See the good in this man--

734
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:38,134
If you can look at this church and how
everybody here has changed for the better...

735
00:55:38,135 --> 00:55:41,170
And say, "this must be stopped"?

736
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:44,674
<i>No, no, no, no, no.
Whatever it is you stand for,</i>

737
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:49,112
father tardone, I don't want
to be a part of.

738
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:56,019
I can't.

739
00:56:00,224 --> 00:56:04,460
I won't wear this anymore.

740
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:08,031
I won't take it.

741
00:56:18,008 --> 00:56:22,312
You see? You see
what he has done?

742
00:56:24,615 --> 00:56:27,417
May god have mercy on you.

743
00:56:49,306 --> 00:56:52,309
You don't have to do it, pat.

744
00:56:55,479 --> 00:56:57,647
He's just afraid. No.

745
00:56:57,648 --> 00:56:59,999
No, it's not about father
tardone, not even about you.

746
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,186
No, it's not about father
tardone, not even about you.

747
00:57:05,489 --> 00:57:10,327
About this. It's me.
I'm the guy.

748
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:18,401
I am part of the clergy
in this town, and, uh,

749
00:57:18,402 --> 00:57:22,138
I believe in those people and
wanna be there for them,

750
00:57:22,139 --> 00:57:27,643
but I quit
because I'm too afraid.

751
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:29,999
I'm too-- I can't take
what's in here...

752
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,049
I'm too-- I can't take
what's in here...

753
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:36,018
And live by it and teach it.

754
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:39,522
So I might as well...

755
00:57:39,523 --> 00:57:42,592
Just accept that I suck
at being a priest.

756
00:57:44,728 --> 00:57:47,464
It's not true, pat.

757
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:53,369
What do you know about
being a priest, Joshua?

758
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:57,707
What do you know about the
responsibility I feel?

759
00:57:57,708 --> 00:57:59,999
You're just a guy. You're just a
guy who's trying to help out.

760
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,744
You're just a guy. You're just a
guy who's trying to help out.

761
00:58:01,745 --> 00:58:03,980
Same as you.

762
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:08,318
No, it's not that simple, because
I have to be more than that.

763
00:58:09,353 --> 00:58:12,054
There is so much
in here that I--

764
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:14,391
It just needs
to be understood, and--

765
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,528
I can't.

766
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:22,732
I can't be the one
to show them the way,

767
00:58:22,733 --> 00:58:24,968
'cause I'm the one
that's the failure.

768
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:36,712
You're wrong, pat.

769
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:38,615
It is that simple.

770
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,662
- Hi, Maggie.
- Hey, Joshua.

771
00:59:59,663 --> 01:00:00,000
<i>Made it just in time.</i>

772
01:00:00,001 --> 01:00:01,730
<i>Made it just in time.</i>

773
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:04,200
Now, Theo,

774
01:00:04,201 --> 01:00:06,368
since you're the first one
who came to help,

775
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:08,404
you should be the one
to put the bell on the steeple.

776
01:00:08,405 --> 01:00:12,508
Aw, thank you, j-Joshua.

777
01:00:12,509 --> 01:00:16,445
Hand it over, guys. I-I got it.

778
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,981
Take it easy, now.
That thing is big.

779
01:00:18,982 --> 01:00:20,750
It's a long way up there.

780
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:28,157
Praise our lord.

781
01:00:28,158 --> 01:00:29,999
Praise his... h-holy name.

782
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,262
Praise his... h-holy name.

783
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:00,000
No! No!

784
01:01:00,001 --> 01:01:00,501
No! No!

785
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:06,596
No!

786
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:07,691
Theo, can you hear me?

787
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,596
I know you can hear me.

788
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:16,065
I want you to listen.

789
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:18,500
You're gonna wake up.

790
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:22,571
Your work's not done. You've got
a whole lot more left to do.

791
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,708
Okay, now, come on.

792
01:02:26,176 --> 01:02:29,278
Let's just wake up.

793
01:02:29,279 --> 01:02:29,999
Come on, now.

794
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,114
Come on, now.

795
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:34,750
Wake up.

796
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,152
That's it.

797
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:39,022
That's it.

798
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:43,026
That's it.

799
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:49,331
What happened?

800
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:52,234
You fell off the roof.

801
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:54,271
Hey, pat,
you wanna give us a hand?

802
01:02:55,405 --> 01:02:57,607
Sit up. You'll be all right.

803
01:02:58,975 --> 01:02:59,999
Come on.

804
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,677
Come on.

805
01:03:05,048 --> 01:03:06,750
Come on.

806
01:03:09,419 --> 01:03:12,187
You all right?

807
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:14,523
I'm okay.

808
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:17,994
Thank you.

809
01:03:28,705 --> 01:03:29,999
What just happened here?

810
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:30,960
What just happened here?

811
01:03:36,613 --> 01:03:41,317
I mean, it's-it's possible he
survived the 40-foot fall...

812
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:43,619
And-and heart stop.

813
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:47,724
And they start again. I know that.
That happens. But you--

814
01:03:49,192 --> 01:03:53,395
You talked to,
and-and put your hands on...

815
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:57,600
A certifiably dead person and
you brought him back to life.

816
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:18,754
<i>Joshua had a way of making a person
see what was inside of them,</i>

817
01:04:18,755 --> 01:04:20,757
<i>and that even applied to me.</i>

818
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:26,095
Bless me, father, for I have sinned. It has
been one week since my last confession.

819
01:04:26,096 --> 01:04:28,997
What was your sin, my son?

820
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:29,999
I let my anger get in the way of my
calling. I turned my back on my vocation.

821
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,601
I let my anger get in the way of my
calling. I turned my back on my vocation.

822
01:04:32,602 --> 01:04:35,304
But I have overcome
my crisis of faith.

823
01:04:35,305 --> 01:04:38,173
And what has caused
this reversal?

824
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:41,377
You know what it is.
I am not resigning.

825
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:45,013
I know what I have seen,
and I know what I have to do.

826
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:47,549
So now this Joshua
has stolen my congregation?

827
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:52,121
You leave me no choice but to
involve Rome, pat. It's father pat!

828
01:04:52,122 --> 01:04:56,091
I promise you, father pat, the
Vatican shall know of this,

829
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:59,428
and when they do, this
miracle worker will vanish.

830
01:04:59,429 --> 01:04:59,999
He will simply run away.

831
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,264
He will simply run away.

832
01:05:02,265 --> 01:05:04,267
You're wrong about him,
father tardone.

833
01:05:33,563 --> 01:05:36,432
- Joshua?
<i>- Hey, Charlie.</i>

834
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:40,169
In all my years
as a postal employee,

835
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:42,404
I've never seen anything
so beautiful.

836
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:44,540
<i>What?</i> This isn't a letter.

837
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:46,408
It's a present. From who?

838
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:48,544
It's from the Vatican.

839
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:50,712
Special Vatican stamp
is right there.

840
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:53,282
Huh? You know, when
you visit the pope,

841
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:55,384
you're supposed to bring a gift.

842
01:05:55,385 --> 01:05:59,121
I don't know if I'll be visiting the
pope, but thanks for the etiquette tip.

843
01:05:59,122 --> 01:05:59,999
Do you think I could
get a picture with it?

844
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,691
Do you think I could
get a picture with it?

845
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:04,727
Well, sure,
if you've got a camera.

846
01:06:06,262 --> 01:06:09,666
I've got--
I've got one here.

847
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:15,437
You will be giving the sermon this
Sunday, and I shall be back in, uh,

848
01:06:15,438 --> 01:06:17,506
in less than a week.

849
01:06:17,507 --> 01:06:21,577
Hmm. Why are you going to Rome?

850
01:06:21,578 --> 01:06:24,714
If you must know, I've decided
to take my study now.

851
01:06:25,615 --> 01:06:28,317
I have you and your pancakes
to thank.

852
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:29,999
You know, Joshua
was invited to the Vatican.

853
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:30,719
You know, Joshua
was invited to the Vatican.

854
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:34,457
Really? I think I heard
some mention of that.

855
01:06:37,026 --> 01:06:39,461
<i>They won't let you in.</i>

856
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:42,731
I advise you to make the most
of your sermon, father pat.

857
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:45,535
It'll be a long time before
you're given your own parish.

858
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:34,250
Come on in.

859
01:07:35,585 --> 01:07:37,654
Hi.

860
01:07:39,088 --> 01:07:42,258
Maggie, hi.

861
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:47,062
Um, I just wanted to make sure
I said good-bye.

862
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:50,332
Oh, yeah, your new job.
Good luck with that.

863
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:54,736
No, act-- actually, I meant you...
In Rome.

864
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:59,274
I just assumed you
wouldn't be coming back.

865
01:07:59,275 --> 01:07:59,999
Yeah, I don't know.

866
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,245
Yeah, I don't know.

867
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:07,082
Actually, I'm being
a little nosey.

868
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,551
Um, I kind of wanted
to see where you lived.

869
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:13,255
Yeah? Well, here it is.

870
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:16,192
I sleep up there,
and I work over here.

871
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:21,063
It suits you somehow.

872
01:08:21,064 --> 01:08:23,065
Oh, wow.

873
01:08:23,066 --> 01:08:26,735
Wow, Joshua. This is lovely.
<i>Thanks.</i>

874
01:08:26,736 --> 01:08:29,038
It's yours.

875
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:32,408
And you know what's
the best part?

876
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:37,680
Come here. Look at that.

877
01:08:38,982 --> 01:08:41,550
<i>Oh, it's beautiful.</i>

878
01:08:41,551 --> 01:08:44,053
Isn't that something
in the moonlight?

879
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:48,057
Then why are you leaving?

880
01:08:51,561 --> 01:08:53,663
Why are you?

881
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:03,473
I'm not the one.

882
01:09:06,042 --> 01:09:09,511
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

883
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:12,114
No, Maggie--
No, I'm sorry. I'm--

884
01:09:12,115 --> 01:09:15,317
Wow. I'm, uh--
I misread. I--

885
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:17,319
I-I apologize. I really--

886
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:20,490
No. <i>I feel like an idiot.</i>

887
01:09:21,391 --> 01:09:24,359
I just...

888
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:27,162
Miss my husband, and, um--

889
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:29,999
This is so confusing. I--
My life is a mess.

890
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,720
This is so confusing. I--
My life is a mess.

891
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,203
Your life's not a mess, Maggie.

892
01:09:36,139 --> 01:09:38,274
Your life is beautiful.

893
01:09:39,442 --> 01:09:42,145
My life <i>was</i> beautiful.

894
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:47,750
It was great. It was whole.

895
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:51,120
Now it's--

896
01:09:52,655 --> 01:09:57,160
That is my life,
and it can't be fixed.

897
01:09:58,494 --> 01:09:59,999
I'm sorry.

898
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,630
I'm sorry.

Remember to lay off the pasta, Joshua.
Oh, yeah.

916
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:14,504
Those carbs will kill you.
I can see that, buddy.

917

01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:25,214
it was delicious!

920
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:28,417
I had a good teacher.

921
01:11:30,186 --> 01:11:33,522
Will we see you again?
You never know.

922
01:11:33,523 --> 01:11:36,592
There's always a place for you.
I know that.

923
01:11:38,528 --> 01:11:40,729
Charlie. Take care.
Thanks for everything.

924
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:43,565
Hey, you too.
Send us a postcard.

925
01:11:43,566 --> 01:11:45,500
I will. You got it. Joshua.

926
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:47,569
Don't forget to send us
back some pictures.

927
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:52,140
Oh, great. I won't.
It's a promise. Okay.

928
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,442
Kevin. I never got another
chance to play with you.

929
01:11:54,443 --> 01:11:57,012
Yeah. We will, okay?
Soon enough.

930
01:11:57,013 --> 01:11:59,048
All right. Take care.
All right. You too.

931
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:03,084
Reverend. Joshua, the church
will be praying for you.

932
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:04,986
And I for you. Thank you.

933
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:07,089

01:15:23,052 --> 01:15:25,687
<i>I mean, he certainly
didn't have to.</i>

987
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:29,999
<i>But I now know that from the
moment Joshua set foot in auburn,</i>

988
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:30,493
<i>but I now know that from the
moment Joshua set foot in auburn,</i>

989
01:15:30,494 --> 01:15:33,362
<i>Rome was his destiny.</i>

990
01:15:59,255 --> 01:15:59,999
Ah, you must be Joshua.

991
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,123
Ah, you must be Joshua.

992
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:04,125
Welcome to the Vatican.

993
01:16:04,126 --> 01:16:06,429
I'm glad to be here.

994
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:11,533
An old friend, father tardone,

995
01:16:11,534 --> 01:16:15,170
<i>has told me what has been
happening in, uh,</i>

996
01:16:15,171 --> 01:16:18,173
auburn, I guess it is.

997
01:16:18,174 --> 01:16:22,110
From what I hear, you've been doing
some extraordinary things in auburn.

998
01:16:22,111 --> 01:16:24,980
No, cardinal, I've done
nothing extraordinary.

999
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:28,416
I came to auburn and saw
there was work to be done.

1000
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:29,999
- God's work?
- <i>You could say that.</i>

1001
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,753
- God's work?
- <i>You could say that.</i>

1002
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:35,423
I started to build
and people came to join me.

1003
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:39,594
You built a church,
as I understand it.

1004
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:44,333
- For what reason?
- I never thought I needed a reason.

1005
01:16:45,501 --> 01:16:49,537
So you don't
consider yourself a--

1006
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:51,474
A spiritual leader?

1007
01:16:52,675 --> 01:16:55,578
I am what I am.

1008
01:16:56,645 --> 01:16:59,999
You don't seem dangerous
or evil.

1009
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:00,483
You don't seem dangerous
or evil.

1010
01:17:00,484 --> 01:17:03,551
<i>Don't let him fool you,
cardinal.</i>

1011
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:07,422
He is not what he seems.
I know who you are.

1012
01:17:07,423 --> 01:17:10,125
On our friendship,

1013
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:13,061
this man is a danger.

1014
01:17:13,062 --> 01:17:17,065
I beg a formal condemnation
of him by the Vatican.

1015
01:17:17,066 --> 01:17:20,702
<i>I believe he is leading
our people away from god.</i>

1016
01:17:20,703 --> 01:17:25,106
<i>Father tardone, if you honestly believe
that I'm some sort of false prophet...</i>

1017
01:17:25,107 --> 01:17:29,010
Who's come to auburn
to mislead people,

1018
01:17:29,011 --> 01:17:29,999
<i>then I accept your condemnation.</i>

1019
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,045
<i>Then I accept your condemnation.</i>

1020
01:17:31,046 --> 01:17:33,314
But is that truly
what you see in me?

1021
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:35,550
It is.

1022
01:17:35,551 --> 01:17:38,686
I fear you are out
to hurt my people.

1023
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:43,325
That's not what
you're afraid of, is it?

1024
01:17:45,194 --> 01:17:47,329
You don't fear me?

1025
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:51,432
You fear what's inside of you.

1026
01:17:51,433 --> 01:17:54,537
How do you know
what's inside of me?

1027
01:17:55,471 --> 01:17:57,606
You're afraid to love.

1028
01:18:00,242 --> 01:18:02,278
No, that's not true.

1029
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:06,682
Don't be afraid.

1030
01:18:08,217 --> 01:18:10,119
What are you doing?

1031
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:24,099
Oh, my lord.

1032
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:29,999
I'm so sorry.

1033
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:30,606
I'm so sorry.

1034
01:18:39,148 --> 01:18:41,350
Please forgive me.

1035
01:18:57,466 --> 01:18:59,999
Cardinal riccardo
saw what I saw.

1036
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:00,501
Cardinal riccardo
saw what I saw.

1037
01:19:00,502 --> 01:19:04,539
And now... You'll have an
audience with the pope.

1038
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:06,675
I look forward to it.

1039
01:19:07,977 --> 01:19:11,247
You'll be meeting with him too.
Hmm.

1040
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:14,250
Soon.

1041
01:19:16,552 --> 01:19:19,588
The cardinal saw
the change in you.

1042
01:19:20,990 --> 01:19:23,758
He knows the good work
you've been doing...

1043
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:25,628
Here.

1044
01:19:29,999 --> 01:19:30,000
Is that so?

1045
01:19:30,001 --> 01:19:32,400
Is that so?

1046
01:19:32,401 --> 01:19:34,536
Father pat gets his parish...

1047
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:38,406
And I get my dream?

1048
01:19:38,407 --> 01:19:40,542
So it would seem.

1049
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:47,616
I think--

1050
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:51,320
I think I'm happier
for father pat.

1051
01:19:59,228 --> 01:19:59,999
Joshua, if I may,

1052
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,764
Joshua, if I may,

1053
01:20:04,066 --> 01:20:06,035
what will you tell the pope?

1054
01:20:09,605 --> 01:20:12,308
I'll say the same thing
I've been saying.

1055
01:20:43,272 --> 01:20:45,374
Joshua.

1056
01:20:48,077 --> 01:20:50,311
It's a great pleasure
to meet you.

1057
01:20:50,312 --> 01:20:54,015
I've heard many things
about you.

1058
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:57,152
Cardinal riccardo
was very impressed by you.

1059
01:20:58,420 --> 01:20:59,999
I brought you a gift.

1060
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:00,840
I brought you a gift.

1061
01:21:02,091 --> 01:21:04,093
These are some tools
that I work with.

1062
01:21:11,967 --> 01:21:16,538
Ah, yes. We have
much work to be done.

1063
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:20,409
Sit down.

1064
01:21:25,481 --> 01:21:28,117
I wanted to thank you for the
pledge you made as a child.

1065
01:21:30,386 --> 01:21:32,454
My pledge?

1066
01:21:33,489 --> 01:21:35,991
When your sister was ill.

1067
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:39,494
When she was near death...

1068
01:21:39,495 --> 01:21:43,198
And you spent the entire night in the
loft of your father's barn praying.

1069
01:21:45,534 --> 01:21:49,237
Then the next morning
she was well.

1070
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:52,241
You went to the top of a hill and
you pledged your life to god.

1071
01:21:55,177 --> 01:21:57,311
Who are you?

1072
01:21:57,312 --> 01:21:59,999
Peter, don't you know me?

1073
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,616
Peter, don't you know me?

1074
01:22:01,617 --> 01:22:04,419
The world has become
such a frightening place.

1075
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:06,454
There's so much anger
and not enough love.

1076
01:22:06,455 --> 01:22:11,360
Deep in the hearts of so many
people is an emptiness...

1077
01:22:12,461 --> 01:22:15,097
That nothing of this world
can fill.

1078
01:22:16,565 --> 01:22:20,402
And that emptiness makes it
impossible for them to love.

1079
01:22:25,307 --> 01:22:27,276
It's so overwhelming.

1080
01:22:28,577 --> 01:22:29,999
What should I do?

1081
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:30,712
What should I do?

1082
01:22:32,014 --> 01:22:35,016
Remind them that I love them--

1083
01:22:35,017 --> 01:22:37,552
That I died for them.

1084
01:22:37,553 --> 01:22:39,554
Tell them that my love
is real...

1085
01:22:39,555 --> 01:22:42,390
And that if they open their hearts
to it, I will fill that emptiness,

1086
01:22:42,391 --> 01:22:46,060
and they will be able
to love one another.

1087
01:22:46,061 --> 01:22:47,996
That's the message.

1088
01:22:49,097 --> 01:22:51,066
It hasn't changed.

1089
01:22:53,602 --> 01:22:56,304
Tell them, Peter.

1090
01:22:56,305 --> 01:22:58,440
Tell them.

1091
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:45,419
<i>Life teaches us many lessons,</i>

1092
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:50,458
<i>and Joshua certainly taught us some wonderful
ones about love and understanding.</i>

1093
01:23:50,459 --> 01:23:53,494
<i>But now I'd like to examine one
of the lessons from the Bible.</i>

1094
01:23:53,495 --> 01:23:59,200
Today I want to talk about Peter,
the fisherman, a man I relate to,

1095
01:23:59,201 --> 01:23:59,999
because it seems like every time he opened
his mouth, he stuck his foot into it.

1096
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,160
Because it seems like every time he opened
his mouth, he stuck his foot into it.

1097
01:24:05,607 --> 01:24:08,209
So let's say "amen" for Theo.

1098
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:10,978
Amen.

1099
01:24:10,979 --> 01:24:13,581
Thank you, reverend.

1100
01:24:13,582 --> 01:24:16,050
Giving honor and praise to god,

1101
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:18,753
for without his love and mercy,

1102
01:24:18,754 --> 01:24:21,989
surely I would not be
standing before you all today.
