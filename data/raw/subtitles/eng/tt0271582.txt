1
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:36,329
<i>Well, there you go.</i> All right.
Thanks a lot for the ride.

2
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,364
Okay. It was good talkin' to ya.

3
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:42,568
Nice talkin' to you too.
Okay. Take care.

4
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,671
<i>I'll bet none of us knew when we
woke up on what we all thought...</i>

5
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:51,010
<i>Was just another spring day, that
a stranger had come to our town.</i>

6
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:54,747
<i>Who was he?
Where did he come from?</i>

7
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:59,999
<i>Why did he come here? We may
never quite know the answers,</i>

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,053
<i>why did he come here? We may
never quite know the answers,</i>

9
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:02,723
<i>but we do know
he changed our lives.</i>

10
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:29,999
Come on. What?
Are you chicken, man?

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,586
Come on. What?
Are you chicken, man?

12
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:37,224
Hello.

13
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:43,330
- <i>Get out! Get-- get out of here.
- Ohh.</i>

14
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,569
What-- what's wrong with you?

15
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:55,675
I don't...
Want no... trouble, Mr.--

16
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:59,999
- Joshua.
- Nice to meet you... Joshua.

17
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,520
- Joshua.
- Nice to meet you... Joshua.

18
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:08,320
Big-big storm. Real...
big storm last year.

19
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:11,091
Must've been.

20
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:18,564
<i>I was... baptized here...
As a child.</i>

21
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:21,635
You were? Huh.

22
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:53,165
Ramona, how are you today? Haven't
seen you for a while. <i>Fine.</i>

23
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:57,636
<i>I don't care what you call it! You ain't
gonna play that kind of music in my house!</i>

24
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,999
<i>Music? What do you know about it? I
mean, you don't even listen to it.</i>

25
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,340
<i>Music? What do you know about it? I
mean, you don't even listen to it.</i>

26
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:03,609
<i>- You don't even listen to me!
- I know the whole town thinks you're a slacker!</i>

27
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,113
You just don't understand, do you?
<i>Get back here, Kevin!</i>

28
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:11,417
Look, it's my music, all right?
Just stay out of-- ho.

29
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:15,555
I don't need this, dad! You hear me?
I don't need this!

30
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,545
Good morning.

31
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:12,178
<i>It's perfect. It is?</i>

32
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:16,215
Yep. I can work
and sleep in the same place.

33
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:19,318
<i>My husband used to use this as his
workplace, but I never thought...</i>

34
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,454
<i>We'd rent it out
to anyone to live.</i>

35
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:27,593
It's fantastic. I'll take it. You
haven't rented it, have you?

36
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,999
You got here
just in time, sweetie.

37
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,360
You got here
just in time, sweetie.

38
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,334
What is it you said
you did again?

39
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:39,605
I'm a wood carver, but I do all sorts
of things-- odd jobs, handiwork.

40
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:42,074
I like gettin' my hands dirty.

41
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:47,112
We've got plenty of things to do
around here, keep you real busy.

42
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:50,750
Here. I made something for you.

43
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:56,322
You made this? <i>For you.</i>

44
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:58,658
It's so beautiful.

45
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:03,762
<i>It's a pretty view, isn't it?</i>

46
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,766
<i>It's perfect.</i>

47
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,384
<i>We all knew he was... different,</i>

48
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,754
<i>and we knew
he was somehow... special,</i>

49
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:29,999
<i>but none of us knew the trouble we were in and
just how much we would end up needing him.</i>

50
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,394
<i>But none of us knew the trouble we were in and
just how much we would end up needing him.</i>

51
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:18,003
He's tearin' down the church!
He's tearin' it down!

52
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:22,042
What? Michael Reed, what are you talking
about? He's tearin' down the church!

53
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:29,999
- Can I help you?
- Actually, yeah.

54
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,360
- Can I help you?
- Actually, yeah.

55
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:35,554
You didn't really mean, "can I help
you?" Did you? <i>- Got that right.</i>

56
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:39,525
- You meant, what the heck am I doing here?
- You're right.

57
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:42,728
What are you doing
tearing down our church?

58
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:46,665
Well, sometimes we just gotta tear
something down to build it back up again.

59
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:50,736
I can... see that.
Theo, get back over here.

60
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:54,273
No. <i>No?</i>

61
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:59,044
He's right. Sometimes
you must tear it down...

62
00:07:59,045 --> 00:07:59,999
To... build it back up.

63
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,715
To... build it back up.

64
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:11,724
Well, all right, then.

65
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:15,528
How could I be late again?

66
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:55,601
Good morning. Today,
our new testament reading...

67
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:59,471
<i>Is from the book of acts,
chapter ten.</i>

68
00:08:59,472 --> 00:08:59,999
And in this passage,

69
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,374
and in this passage,

70
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,413
Peter is up on a roof
in joppa, and--

71
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:21,261
Well, Peter was a fisherman.

72
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:29,999
- Nice to see you.
- Thank you.

73
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,470
- Nice to see you.
- Thank you.

74
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:33,605
Thank you, father. Thank
you and god bless you.

75
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:37,977
I don't remember fishing boots as
proper attire for a sermon, father pat.

76
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:43,650
Thank you. Thank you.

77
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:48,320
Maggie!

78
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,422
Hey, pat.

79
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:54,560
I haven't seen you in church in ages, and now
you're gonna sneak off without saying hi?

80
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:57,563
Actually, it's good-bye.
You got the job.

81
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,999
Mm-hmm. Now, when do
you actually leave?

82
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,400
Mm-hmm. Now, when do
you actually leave?

83
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:04,002
In about a week or so. I still have so
much I have to go through at the house.

84
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:07,272
A few memories, huh?

85
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,276
Excuse me.

86
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:17,549
Hello? Deb. Listen, could you
hold on just for a second?

87
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,285
Okay. I'm sorry.

88
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,255
Um, thank you, father pat.
It was great seeing you.

89
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:27,526
You too, Maggie. Hey, if you're in town
next week, come by the pancake breakfast.

90
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:29,999
Oh, no, Maggie. I'm
not cooking this year.

91
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,596
Oh, no, Maggie. I'm
not cooking this year.

92
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:32,731
I'll try.

93
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,635
Okay. Good-bye. Good-bye.

94
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:42,107
â™ª No, he's nice. It's just--
I'm not ready, you know?

95
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:46,078
No, I'm not.
I need to get out of here.

96
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,382
<i>However, you never know...</i>

97
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:54,119
What might make me wanna
stick around.

98
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,090
Look, Joan, don't you worry.
Everything's gonna be fine.

99
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:59,999
<i>I could find out everything that
can be found out about him.</i>

100
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,460
<i>I could find out everything that
can be found out about him.</i>

101
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:06,565
The U.S. post office doesn't miss a thing.
Except deliveries.

102
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:11,070
Who are you guys talking about?
Joshua, the guy renting our barn.

103
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:15,574
He gave me this pretty heart.
Ohh.

104
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:18,977
Thanks. Oh, there-- there's
the guy I was talking about.

105
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:22,414
Hey, look at that. Hey,
Leo, what is that?

106
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:25,484
That must weigh a ton.
<i>What the hell?</i>

107
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:28,487
<i>Look at that!</i>

108
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:29,999
<i>How much does that thing weigh?</i> I don't
know. About, what, 500 pounds maybe?

109
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,058
<i>How much does that thing weigh?</i> I don't
know. About, what, 500 pounds maybe?

110
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,228
Five'll get you ten, he don't get to
the end of main street. You're on.

111
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:39,632
Leo, this is gonna be the easiest
money I ever made. I don't think so.

112
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:45,704
Hey, buck, what's goin' on? You're gonna
break your back. Why don't you use a truck?

113
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,739
I don't drive. Want some water?

114
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,643
No, thanks. I'm fine. If you want
some, ray, you go right ahead.

115
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:55,515
How does he know your name?
Probably heard you yappin'.

116
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,999
Wow, look at him go.

117
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,253
Wow, look at him go.

118
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:02,521
Hey, maybe you should put that down.
The footing's not too good around here.

119
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:04,724
I'll be all right.

120
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:09,362
<i>Come on, stranger.</i>

121
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,973
Thanks for walking me home, everybody.
Nice of ya.

122
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:25,043
What? Now we gotta walk all the way back?
Like I told ya, I don't drive.

123
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,246
Thanks. See ya later.

124
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,381
I told ya he was gonna make it.
Shut up.

125
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:29,999
You shut up. I'll make
you carry me back.

126
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,685
You shut up. I'll make
you carry me back.

127
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:41,026
<i>â™ª</i>

128
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:44,229
Hello, Joan. Did it come in?

129
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,432
- I kept it right back here for you, father pat.
- Hey.

130
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,669
Leo, ray. <i>Hey, father pat.</i>

131
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:54,674
<i>Ahh. Sonar fisherman. Thanks.
</i> Lookin' good.

132
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:59,144
Where'd you get that?

133
00:12:59,145 --> 00:12:59,999
You know that fellow that was
carrying the log? He made this?

134
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,481
You know that fellow that was
carrying the log? He made this?

135
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:08,020
- He does all sorts of things.
- Really? There's an artist living in auburn? Wow.

136
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:11,156
Hey, Charlie, you ever find
anything out about his mail?

137
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,326
That's just it.
He doesn't get any mail.

138
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:17,462
It's not natural to not get any mail.
No junk mail?

139
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:22,634
<i>Nothing at all?</i> He did get one thing.
Columbia house music offer.

140
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,039
Aw, man! Did he take it?

141
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:29,999
Thank you.

142
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,109
Thank you.

<i>Sorry. Emergency. Thanks a lot.
Certainly.</i>

In the name of the father, the
son and the holy spirit, amen.

146

In the name of the father, the
son and the holy spirit, amen.

147
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:08,246
Bless me father, for I have sinned. It has
been two hours since my last confession.

148
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:13,518
And what sin could you possibly have
committed in the last two hours?

149
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,357
I guess my sin is I don't have a sin. I
just need to talk to you right away.

150
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:22,561
You cannot interrupt members of the
congregation with your own personal needs.

151
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:26,565
Now, what is so important that you're
using the confessional in this manner?

152
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:29,999
I found him, sir. Found who?

153
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,470
I found him, sir. Found who?

154
00:14:30,471 --> 00:14:33,973
An artist has moved into town.

155
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,245
Joan Casey has all his stuff at her store.
It's all good. Is it all by hand?

156
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:45,083
Yeah. This is the lord's work.
An artist living in town.

157
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,352
Maybe he can have it
done by Christmas. Ah.

158
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:50,155
<i>Hello?</i> Oh, are you the artist?

159
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:54,493
I'm Joshua. I'm father tardone.
This is father pat.

160
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,628
Hello, father pat. Hi, Joshua.
Nice to meet you.

161
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,999
I have a commission for you.
Hmm. Come on in.

162
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,168
I have a commission for you.
Hmm. Come on in.

163
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:09,274
You live here? I do.

164
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:12,278
What do you do when it rains?
Well, it hasn't rained.

165
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:19,484
I would like you to make a
figure of the apostle Peter.

166
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:23,688
Now, Peter was not only the
chosen leader of the apostles,

167
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:28,427
he was established by Jesus as
the foundation of the church.

168
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,999
- I know Peter.
- Good.

169
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,563
- I know Peter.
- Good.

170
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:36,435
Now-- now, I'm looking for
something-- oh, how shall I say--

171
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,304
Expressive of you.

172
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:44,476
- Expressive of my faith.
<i>- Uh, excuse me, Joshua,</i>

173
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:46,545
there's a hole over your bed.

174
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:50,048
- Father pat.
- Oh, sorry.

175
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,217
Now, for material,

176
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:55,153
I was thinking that
we might use--

177
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:59,999
- Ash.
- Ash. Yes. Ash.

178
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,880
- Ash.
- Ash. Yes. Ash.

179
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:07,466
- That's what I was thinking.
- Yeah.

180
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:11,603
All right. Thanks, Joshua. I'm sure it's
gonna be great. <i>You guys take care.</i>

181
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:14,072
He seems like a nice guy.
Yeah, maybe.

182
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:17,242
He's an artist. They can
be temperamental. Yeah.

183
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:20,612
When I--
When I was in Rome last summer,

184
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:23,682
I had an audience
with cardinal riccardo.

185
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:27,986
Uh-oh. He told this interesting
story about Michelangelo.

186
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,999
It seems that when he was given
his commission, he hit the stone,

187
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,123
it seems that when he was given
his commission, he hit the stone,

188
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:36,195
and sure enough, the wrong statue
came out of the stone. My goodness.

189
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,264
<i>He began with the simple act of working
on something that needed doing.</i>

190
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:18,070
<i>It looked like something we all needed,
but, boy, did it cause a lot of trouble.</i>

191
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:23,341
I saw Joshua rebuilding the
baptist church this morning.

192
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,977
Rebuilding the baptist church?
I thought he was an artist.

193
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,113
Looked more
like a lumberjack today.

194
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:29,999
Well, I hope he allows time
to finish our statue.

195
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,417
Well, I hope he allows time
to finish our statue.

196
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,987
Theo was out there with him.

197
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:40,525
Theo? How many others
were there?

198
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:43,495
It was just Theo. Hmm.

199
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:47,699
Interesting man, this Joshua. He can't
expect to do all that work by himself.

200
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,168
He'll need other people
to help him.

201
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:53,238
Oh, I think he'll find them.
People really seem to like him.

202
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:58,143
Really? Is there anything about
this Joshua that strikes you...

203
00:17:58,144 --> 00:17:59,999
As peculiar?

204
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,112
As peculiar?

205
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:04,249
I have a brother who's peculiar.
Joshua isn't anything like him.

206
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:10,289
- Still, he's different.
- He's very different.

207
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:19,364
You stuck? No, it's just a fuse thing.
It happens all the time.

208
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:23,034
I think I got it. Uh-huh.

209
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:27,272
Well, it's the stranger.
The stranger?

210
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,999
Anyone who's lived here less
than 15 years is a stranger.

211
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,676
Anyone who's lived here less
than 15 years is a stranger.

212
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,679
Ah. So that makes you--

213
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,016
An expatriate. I'm moving.

214
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:43,521
Oh. Said the stranger
I'm Joshua.

215
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:46,224
Maggie. How you doing?

216
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:50,096
You just passing through, Joshua?
Yeah, eventually.

217
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:55,533
Yeah, it's a little slow here.
I don't know.

218
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:59,999
You never know what might
make you wanna stick around.

219
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,172
You never know what might
make you wanna stick around.

220
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,443
It was good to meet you.

221
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:12,118
<i>â™ª</i>

222
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:16,154
<i>â™ª I'm not gonna cry â™ª</i>

223

226
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:29,999
I got a ticket for speeding again.
<i>â™ª And I am not afraid â™ª</i>

227
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,639
I got a ticket for speeding again.

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,210
â™ª

229
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:42,514
Hello, father pat.

230
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,150
Hi, Joshua. How are ya?

231
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:48,286
Good, thanks. Good to see ya.

232
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:51,289
Can I offer you something to drink?
No, thanks.

233
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:56,227
What can I do for ya?
So this is gonna be it?

234
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:59,999
Yep. Peter's in there somewhere. I just
gotta figure out where he's hiding.

235
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,199
Yep. Peter's in there somewhere. I just
gotta figure out where he's hiding.

236
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,472
Actually, that's why I'm here. I thought--
I thought you might like this book.

237
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:11,443
Thank you, pat. That's
really nice of you.

238
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:16,147
Well, this statue...

239
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:19,617
Is very important
to father tardone.

240
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,353
Yeah, I kind of
got that impression.

241
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:27,125
<i>He's an interesting man, isn't he?
</i> Hmm.

242
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:29,999
I'm not sure how happy
father tardone is...

243
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,129
I'm not sure how happy
father tardone is...

244
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,098
Here in auburn.

245
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:36,568
He was going to go to Rome, work at the
Vatican with his friend cardinal riccardo.

246
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:41,539
- Things didn't work out.
- Sometimes it's who you know, you know?

247
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:46,311
Yeah, I was gonna replace him here.
<i>You will.</i>

248
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:51,583
Well, if I do, I'll be getting
to the pulpit with a Walker.

249
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:56,755
Boy, look at that rain
come down.

250
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,999
<i>â™ª</i>

251
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,500
<i>â™ª</i>

252
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:07,599
- It's not raining in here.
- Yeah, I know. Amazing, huh?

253
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,668
Yeah.

254
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:13,272
Well, break's over.

255
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:22,013
You really gonna
rebuild the baptist church?

256
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:26,050
We're gonna do our best.

257
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:29,755
Well, uh,
good luck with everything.

258
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,691
You know, you can stay
if you want, pat.

259
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:38,097
Well, I'll watch for a little while.
Sure.

260
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:29,999
You know, you're gonna scare away
all the fish with that racket.

261
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,617
You know, you're gonna scare away
all the fish with that racket.

262
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:35,120
Hi, Joshua.

263
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:40,992
- What is that thing?
<i>- Oh, the sonar fisherman.</i>

264
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:43,761
<i>Very special.
Not sold in stores.</i>

265
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:46,364
- There's usually a reason for that.
- No, no.

266
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:51,403
No. Money-back guarantee. It has a special
sonar sound that naturally attracts fish.

267
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:59,999
- We'll see about that.
- What are you doing?

268
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,246
- We'll see about that.
- What are you doing?

269
00:23:00,247 --> 00:23:06,117
<i>No, don't. No, no, no, no! All right.
You owe me 39.95, buddy.</i>

270
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:08,519
So what am I supposed to do now?
Just fish?

271
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,458
Oh, ye of little fish.

272
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:20,999
That sounded pretty good.

273
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,035
Something I can do for you, man?

274
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:27,505
You got a gig coming up
or something?

275
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:29,999
- Something like that.
- Can I try?

276
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,360
- Something like that.
- Can I try?

277
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,982
You play? Not really.

278
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:43,422
â™ª

279
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:50,028
â™ª I thought you said
you didn't play?

280
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:54,033
It's the guitar, man, not me. I'm
just trying to stay out of the way.

281
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:06,577
It's... going to be...
Beautiful, isn't it?

282
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:11,083
- You can see that already?
- I can.

283
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:18,423
You know... I wanted
to be a... preacher too.

284
00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:22,694
- You're gonna be a great preacher, Theo.
- No.

285
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:28,500
Can you imagine... How long...
my sermons would be?

286
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:36,175
Let me ask you a question. You know
what it is you want to say, don't you?

287
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:39,177
I d-do.

288
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:42,613
Well, you just start sayin' it;
I guarantee people will listen.

289
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:44,483
Hmm.

290
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:48,586
<i>Joan?</i> In here!

291
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:51,422
<i>Can I come in?</i> Come on in.

292
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:54,325
I got your rent. <i>Oh.</i>

293
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,061
Here. I'll put it over here.
Thank you.

294
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,999
- What are you cooking?
- Uh, well, at one point, it resembled a fish.

295
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,532
- What are you cooking?
- Uh, well, at one point, it resembled a fish.

296
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:04,470
This snapper or my marriage.

297
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,439
Well, I know
what the fish would say.

298
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,077
- What are these?
- Corn fritters.

299
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:20,419
Joan, this is the worst
corn fritter I've ever tasted.

300
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:29,999
<i>Joshua had a way of helping
by just-- just being there.</i>

301
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,528
<i>Joshua had a way of helping
by just-- just being there.</i>

302
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:34,232
Come on. What do you
got in the fridge?

303
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:37,336
Hello, beautiful.

304
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,605
<i>And bam!</i>

305
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:44,342
I never thought I'd say this.
I caught a fish this big.

306
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:48,679
Father pat, as one religious man to another, I
don't think you should be tellin' fish stories.

307
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:53,184
- It was this big.
- No. Uh, Joshua... Was with us.

308
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:56,154
- No, he was fishing with me.
- He couldn't have been doing either.

309
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:59,457
- He was helping me with guitar.
- He was over at my place. He taught me to cook.

310
00:25:59,458 --> 00:25:59,999
I think it was a miracle. Someone
taught Joan how to cook!

311
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,596
I think it was a miracle. Someone
taught Joan how to cook!

312
00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:13,438
Praise the lord!
That's the last wall.

313
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:16,641
Let's pack it up now and do the rest
tomorrow. Let's get this one up tonight.

314
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:20,645
Yeah. Let's do this; Then we'll call
it a day. We can... get this done.

315
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:23,314
Got that right. Hey, tough
guys, grab the braces, okay?

316
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:26,651
Yeah. All right, everybody.
On three--

317
00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:29,999
One, two, three!

318
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,022
One, two, three!

319
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:33,157
Push.

320
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:38,296
All right.

321
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:41,999
<i>â™ª There's a dream â™ª</i> ooh.

322
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,536
<i>â™ª That I can dream â™ª</i>
Pretty good day's work, guys.

323
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:49,273
Let's get all these tools put away.
<i>â™ª Of my heavenly â™ª</i>

324
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,676
- Hey, reverend, help me with this.
- That was great, ray.

325
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:55,279
There we go. Oh, boy.
We come back tomorrow.

326
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,217
<i>â™ª - I know â™ª</i> You got a broom in your hand.
Why don't you use it?

327
00:26:59,218 --> 00:26:59,999
<i>â™ª That I'm going â™ª</i>
look at this fool.

328
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,987
<i>â™ª That I'm going â™ª</i>
look at this fool.

329
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:08,326
<i>â™ª There one day, ohh â™ª</i>

330
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:13,197
<i>We all know the definition
of the word community,</i>

331
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:17,468
<i>but until Joshua came along, we
didn't really live in one, did we?</i>

332
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,171
<i>â™ª</i>

333
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:24,008
Okay. I'm ready.

334
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:27,712
- How's this? Is this good?
<i>- Yeah, looks great. Looks great.</i>

335
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:29,999
<i>All right. All right. We're rolling.
Anytime you're ready.</i>

336
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,182
<i>All right. All right. We're rolling.
Anytime you're ready.</i>

337
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:34,619
For nearly a year, the auburn
baptist church has stood in ruin,

338
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,054
decaying before the town's eyes.

339
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:41,592
That was until a few weeks ago, when the
community came together to rebuild it.

340
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:44,162
Where we stackin' 'em, Dave?
Cut. How was that?

341
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:48,132
<i>Just great. Great.</i>
Let's grab a few interviews.

342
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:52,236
This Joshua's an amazing guy. I mean, he
brought the whole community together.

343
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:56,474
I mean, this place was a wreck two
weeks ago, and look at it now.

344
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:59,999
He was like a superhero. Yeah, he carried
the log around like it was a swizzle stick.

345
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,412
He was like a superhero. Yeah, he carried
the log around like it was a swizzle stick.

346
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:04,982
Can I say "swizzle stick"
on television?

347
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:10,354
He... k-kind of...
Showed me the... way.

348
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:15,527
I could tell you one thing He's a member
of the Columbia house music club.

349
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:20,631
That one goes over in the corner, reverend.
<i>Oh, okay, Josh.</i>

350
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:25,236
Did you get your story?
Well, I don't know.

351
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:28,206
All they really wanna
talk about is you.

352
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,999
Not much of a story there.

353
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,510
Not much of a story there.

354
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:35,514
I don't know about that.

355
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,990
Why are you
doing all this, Joshua?

356
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:55,734
Come on and help us.
You'll find out why.

357
00:28:58,637 --> 00:28:59,999
Hey, Charlie. I'm just
down here helpin' out.

358
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,639
Hey, Charlie. I'm just
down here helpin' out.

359
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,342
Great. Aaron?

360
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:06,577
Father. Don't scratch
that car, Aaron.

361
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,181
Don't you worry.

362
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:14,252
Amazing.

363
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,687
<i>Go ahead.</i> Welcome.

364
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:20,424
You keep yourself busy.
There's a lot to do.

365
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,627
- Hello, pat.
- Hi. Hello, Maggie.

366
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:27,231
All these people... Listening to
you, willing to do whatever you say.

367
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,999
We're all in this together.
Yes, of course, Joshua.

368
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,702
We're all in this together.
Yes, of course, Joshua.

369
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:36,407
Well, I hope you don't work on Sundays.
I try not to.

370
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:40,711
Good, because if you did, I
wouldn't have anyone to preach to.

371
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:43,414
Well, I wouldn't worry about that.
Excellent.

372
00:29:43,415 --> 00:29:47,351
So I can expect to see you, then?
See me--

373
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:50,454
Sunday morning mass. Will
you be joining us, Joshua?

374
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,457
Well, thank you,
father. I'd love to.

375
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:58,597
- Maggie?
- Hmm? I will try.

376
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:05,002
Father pat.

377
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:08,439
â™ª <i>And the true miracle...</i>

378
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,208
Will come on judgment day,

379
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:14,679
but until that day,

380
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:20,384
- God is watching you...
- Always.

381
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:23,321
<i>Never forget that.</i>

382
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:29,126
Never forget that the sins you hide from
your neighbors, you cannot hide from god.

383
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:29,999
<i>You either embrace his laws
or you reject them,</i>

384
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,330
<i>you either embrace his laws
or you reject them,</i>

385
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:36,367
but you can
never escape the fact...

386
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:39,271
That he knows the truth.

387
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:53,217
Thank you so much.
We'll see you next Sunday.

388
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,086
Bye-bye.

389
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:57,321
Thank you, father. Nice to see you again.
Nice to see you.

390
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,999
Thank you. Thanks. Thank you.

391
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,492
Thank you. Thanks. Thank you.

392
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:05,429
Come again. Bye.

393
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:09,133
Father tardone,
I am so sorry. I--

394
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:13,070
Joshua. Father, thank you
so much for inviting me.

395
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:16,173
You're welcome. Did you--
Did you enjoy the sermon?

396
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:21,145
I did. It was interesting. I've never
looked at god's law that way before.

397
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:25,216
- What way is that?
- Well, as something to be afraid of.

398
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:29,999
You make it sound pretty scary. -For those
who break god's law, it is pretty scary.

399
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,554
You make it sound pretty scary. -For those
who break god's law, it is pretty scary.

400
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:34,692
- The Bible is clear on that.
- That we should fear god more than we love him?

401
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:38,729
Well, really, the Bible can be
interpreted so many different ways.

402
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,732
For example, there's
the old Sunday school joke.

403
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:45,669
What's that? Well, you know:
"What does the Bible mean?"

404
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,039
"Basic instructions
before leaving earth."

405
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,109
â™ª Give me my sandwich.

406
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:55,146
Hey, now, boys, break it up.
You're so mean.

407
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:59,049
<i>Hey, look at that! Leo!</i>

408
00:31:59,050 --> 00:31:59,999
You as tired as I am?
Ohh, I feel good.

409
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,155
You as tired as I am?
Ohh, I feel good.

410
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,725
Someday you'll be as old as me.
Hopefully as bald.

411
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:10,528
Look at that.

412
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:14,165
<i>I don't think I've seen her
laugh like that in a long time.</i>

413
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:16,333
Why's that?

414
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:19,737
She's not as happy as she should be.
Who is?

415
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:23,140
She has more reason than most.

416
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:29,013
Joe was a great guy, her husband. If any
two people were in love, it was them.

417
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:29,999
One night a couple years ago,
they were driving home on 34...

418
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,616
One night a couple years ago,
they were driving home on 34...

419
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,286
Near
the "welcome to auburn" sign.

420
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:41,125
Truck driver fell asleep. Maggie
was behind the wheel of their car.

421
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:44,595
She walked away, and Joe didn't.

422
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:48,600
Whatever faith she had,
she lost that night.

423
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:56,707
No, wait.
Let me help you there. Hold on.

424
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,743
<i>â™ª</i>

425
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:07,284
Mm. Yeah. Hey, Joan.

426
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:10,688
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you
with this now--

427
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:13,524
Hey, Mike, why don't you go get started?
I'll catch up with you.

428
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:18,062
What happened? Steve got angry
with me, and he threw it.

429
00:33:18,063 --> 00:33:21,065
Ohh. Can you fix it, Joshua?

430
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:25,202
Of course I can.
Don't you worry about it.

431
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:28,405
Here. It's okay.

432
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:29,999
Don't worry about it.

433
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,743
Don't worry about it.

434
00:33:52,264 --> 00:33:55,699
First of all,
the pancake breakfast went well,

435
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,999
but that's not why-- that's not
why I'm here to talk to you.

436
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,571
But that's not why-- that's not
why I'm here to talk to you.

437
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:03,173
<i>Hi, pat.</i>

438
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:05,543
Oh, hi, Joshua. How are you?
Good.

439
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:08,178
Glad to see ya. You okay?

440
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:12,983
Oh, yeah. I'm working on my
sermon for Sunday, so I--

441
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:17,254
I was gonna go shoot some pool. You wanna
come? No. I should work on the sermon.

442
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:20,024
We'll work on it inside. You
know, I really-- I-I-I--

443
00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:22,459
It'll be good for you.
Well, one game.

444
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,529
<i>â™ª</i>

445
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,667
I'm pretty good.

446
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:36,473
<i>Aw, too bad, father.</i>
I'll warm up.

447
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:40,644
- How goes your sermon?
- <i>Oh, well,</i>

448
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:43,714
it's about faith and about how--

449
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:46,417
It doesn't even matter what it's about,
because father tardone is gonna hate it.

450
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:49,119
And I'm gonna feel him staring at
me, and I'm gonna get nervous.

451
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:54,291
- Where does he stand?
- Well, he says that I'm silly and I'm vague and--

452
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:58,696
- No, no, no. Physically, I mean.
- Oh, oh, oh. Right behind me.

453
00:34:58,697 --> 00:34:59,999
Why don't you just talk to the
people that are in front of you?

454
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,399
Why don't you just talk to the
people that are in front of you?

455
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,002
- <i>There you go. This guy's good.</i>
- By the way, when you said...

456
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:08,740
That we were gonna play pool, where does
the "me" part of "we" come in here?

457
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:15,012
<i>All right. I don't wanna hear
that you missed that on purpose.</i>

458
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:18,682
Okay. I didn't
miss that on purpose.

459
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:22,220
Smart guy.
Yeah, well, watch this.

460
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:29,226
You know, I'm still
a little tight-- little tight.

461
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:29,999
<i>But, hey, it's tough.
Describing it...</i>

462
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,464
<i>But, hey, it's tough.
Describing it...</i>

463
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:37,134
Is like trying to describe
a color or the wind.

464
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,337
- It's actually pretty simple, isn't it?
- Simple?

465
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:43,338
If I'd have known it was simple, I
could've skipped eight years of seminary.

466
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:50,248
No, I'm serious.
It's about knowing, right?

467
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:58,155
For instance, I know
I'm gonna make this shot.

468
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,999
I know you can't even
reach the cue ball.

469
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,158
I know you can't even
reach the cue ball.

470
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:03,227
I didn't say I know
how I'm gonna make it,

471
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:06,030
but I know I'm gonna make it.

472
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:09,601
I just gotta
look for a little help.

473
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:17,676
What you gonna do with that?

474
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:26,116
Whoa! Man!

475
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:29,999
Faith. Rack 'em up.

476
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,288
Faith. Rack 'em up.

477
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:33,390
Well, thanks for the advice,
Joshua, but, let's face it,

478
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:35,359
how are we gonna get a pool
table into the church?

479
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,629
Well, even if you could, you suck at pool.
There's that too.

480
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:42,167
<i>Can I drop you somewhere?</i> No, no, no.
I'm not done with you yet.

481
00:36:43,435 --> 00:36:47,005
â™ª You can all call me crazy â™ª

482
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,676
â™ª For some of the things
that I might say â™ª

483
00:36:53,178 --> 00:36:57,614
â™ª You can laugh
all you want to, yeah â™ª

484
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,999
<i>â™ª I know there will come a day â™ª
</i> what are we doing at a rock concert?

485
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,419
<i>â™ª I know there will come a day â™ª
</i> what are we doing at a rock concert?

486
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:06,490
â™ª You sure this is a concert?

487
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:09,260
There's Kevin!

488
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:17,634
<i>â™ª We can learn to love our
neighbor yeah, yeah â™ª</i>

489
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:20,537
<i>â™ª just like we will
love ourselves â™ª</i>

490
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:25,209
â™ª we got to come together 'cause in
the end we can make it all right â™ª

491
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:29,999
â™ª We got to brave the weather
through all of the storms â™ª

492
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,482
â™ª We got to brave the weather
through all of the storms â™ª

493
00:37:30,483 --> 00:37:35,352
â™ª We got to come together 'cause in

494
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:40,257
<i>â™ª We got to learn to love â™ª</i>

00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:52,504
â™ª You know, we've got to you know,
we've got to learn to love â™ª

498
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,544
Whoo!

499
00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:06,351
All right. Good evening,
and welcome to lost and found.

500
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:10,420
This is a church service?

501
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:13,023
One man's concert's
another man's service.

502
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:16,260
As some of you
may or may not know,

503
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:20,597
one of the guitarists in
the band, Kevin zunbar,

504
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:25,336
is actually the newest member of
the lost and found congregation.

505
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:28,339
Whoo!

506
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:34,746
Thank you. I-I--

507
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:43,320
<i>There was a long time
where I felt a bit... lonely,</i>

508
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,557
I guess, and angry.

509
00:38:46,558 --> 00:38:52,129
And, I mean, it was like I was
missing something in my life,

510
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:55,065
but I couldn't figure out
what that something was.

511
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:59,999
<i>And I've realized
that it was god...</i>

512
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,004
<i>And I've realized
that it was god...</i>

513
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:03,340
- Who I was needing...
<i>- Yeah. All right.</i>

514
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:08,345
And that all I needed to do
was open my heart up...

515
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,348
And ask him
to be a part of my life.

516
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,718
<i>Yeah!</i> And I did. I did.

517
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:19,022
So the music we play tonight
is for you...

518
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,625
And him.

519
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:23,994
One, two, three.

520
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:29,999
â™ª Puttin' all the people
to shame â™ª

521
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,360
â™ª Puttin' all the people
to shame â™ª

522
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:36,107
<i>â™ª</i>

523
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,981
â™ª My hope is you â™ª

524
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:48,019
â™ª Show me your way â™ª

525
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:52,557
<i>â™ª</i>

526
00:39:57,996 --> 00:39:59,999
â™ª My hope is you â™ª

527
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,999
â™ª My hope is you â™ª

528
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:06,003
â™ª

529
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:08,973
<i>â™ª Oh, yeah, yeah â™ª</i>

530
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,524
<i>There's an old story
about three men...</i>

531
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:29,999
Looking over A priest,

532
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,094
looking over A priest,

533
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,430
<i>an artist and a cowboy.</i>

534
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:38,535
And the priest says, "what a
beautiful work god has created."

535
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:44,408
The artist says,
"what magnificent colors."

536
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:49,480
And the cowboy says, "boy, what
a lousy place to lose a horse."

537
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,999
Well, uh, I think
the point I'm trying to make...

538
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,425
Well, uh, I think
the point I'm trying to make...

539
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:05,095
Is that we're all individuals,
and as individuals,

540
00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:09,734
there is more than one way to look
at the same thing, even the church.

541
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:20,277
Don't ever give a sermon like
that in my church again.

542
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:25,582
The pulpit is not a place for jokes, nor
is it a place to express individual ideas.

543
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:28,518
I was trying to show how we're
all connected to each other.

544
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:29,999
I will not allow you to express alternative
points of view regarding the church.

545
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,056
I will not allow you to express alternative
points of view regarding the church.

546
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:36,093
<i>Is that clear?</i>

547
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:38,196
Yes, father.

548
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:45,068
<i>â™ª When they
excavate these ruins â™ª</i>

549
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:49,339
<i>â™ª thousands of years from now â™ª</i>

550
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:54,444
<i>â™ª will they wonder
what I was doing â™ª</i>

551
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:59,117
<i>â™ª who I was
and what my life was about â™ª</i>

552
00:42:00,385 --> 00:42:04,554
<i>â™ª when my riches lie in ruin â™ª</i>

553
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:08,759
<i>â™ª on the landscape of my past â™ª</i>

554
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,397
<i>â™ª will they uncover
that I was pursuing â™ª</i>

555
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:18,236
<i>â™ª things in life
that really last â™ª</i>

556
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:23,473
<i>â™ª where â™ª</i>

557
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:27,978
<i>â™ª your treasure is â™ª</i>

558
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:29,999
<i>â™ª the things you love
are a part of you â™ª</i>

559
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,649
<i>â™ª The things you love
are a part of you â™ª</i>

560
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:36,019
<i>â™ª Won't end â™ª</i>

561
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:40,390
<i>I can feel the spirit of Jesus in the
room tonight. Can you feel it now?</i>

562
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,560
<i>Let me hear ya, amen.
Amen, amen.</i>

563
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:48,999
Now, brothers and sisters, what you
gonna experience here tonight...

564
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,104
Is the wonderful, glorious healing power
of our savior, lord Jesus Christ.

565
00:42:54,105 --> 00:42:57,707
- All right, now.
- Who wants to be saved?

566
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:59,999
Let me see your hands. Let me see your hands.
Who would like to feel the spirit of god...

567
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,644
Let me see your hands. Let me see your hands.
Who would like to feel the spirit of god...

568
00:43:00,645 --> 00:43:04,247
<i>Reach in and touch you here
this evening, glory be?</i>

569
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:09,152
You, child, and you, brother.
You, my sister.

570
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:12,355
- What is your name, child?
- Sally Baker.

571
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:16,259
Do you believe that god
loves you, Sally? Yes.

572
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:21,298
And do you believe that through the healing power
of Jesus that you'll be healed here tonight?

573
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:25,235
- Yes, I do.
- <i>Oh, then I say...</i>

574
00:43:25,236 --> 00:43:29,139
Let his spirit fill you
and make you whole!

575
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:29,999
Amen! Yes! Praise god.

576
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,577
Amen! Yes! Praise god.

577
00:43:33,578 --> 00:43:37,581
<i>Praise god. Hallelujah.
Thank you, Jesus!</i>

578
00:43:37,582 --> 00:43:40,351
I can walk. Thank you.

579
00:43:41,419 --> 00:43:45,489
<i>Jesus, thank you. I can walk.</i>

580
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:49,292
Whoo! Yes, lord! Yes, lord!
Now, now, brothers and sisters,

581
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,429
brothers and sisters, just a
quiet moment, if you will.

582
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:56,666
Quiet moment. Before
I ask for your help,

583
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:59,999
I feel we should take a moment
and think about what we've seen.

584
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,138
I feel we should take a moment
and think about what we've seen.

585
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:04,441
Reflect on it. Think about it.
Pray about it.

586
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:08,612
- Let god put it on your heart.
<i>- Amen. Amen.</i>

587
00:44:08,613 --> 00:44:11,249
Let us pray.

588
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:19,323
You don't have to do this.

589
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:23,593
We're prayin' here, sir.

590
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,729
No, you're not.

591
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:29,999
This meeting isn't about prayer.
It's not about healing.

592
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,334
This meeting isn't about prayer.
It's not about healing.

593
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:34,539
You're not seeing what happened
here tonight. <i>Yeah, I saw it.</i>

594
00:44:36,374 --> 00:44:40,077
You and I saw the same thing.

595
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:44,714
You know, you don't
have to do it this way.

596
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:49,153
I know you'd like to have the
faith to talk to these people.

597
00:44:51,656 --> 00:44:54,625
But you don't know
what faith is.

598
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:05,603
She knows. She understands.

599
00:45:11,342 --> 00:45:15,313
I know what's in your heart.

600
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:23,988
I know.

601
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:08,031
I can see.

602
00:46:08,032 --> 00:46:11,736
I can see.

603
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:21,044
<i>â™ª On the wings

<i>â™ª Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh â™ª</i>

617
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:15,598
<i>You know something is out of whack
when simple acts of kindness...</i>

618
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:21,204
<i>And inspiration can lead to so
much misunderstanding and turmoil.</i>

619
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:24,407
It's a miracle.

620
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:28,211
A miracle! A miracle.

621
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:29,999
A miracle.

622
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,980
A miracle.

623
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:34,351
Aaron, you're Jewish.
What are you doing here?

624
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:37,621
I thought someone
should tell you.

625
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:46,663
<i>Father tardone. Have
you heard the news?</i>

626
00:47:46,664 --> 00:47:52,602
Father pat, before you start espousing yet
another miracle, I advise you to take a breath.

627
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:56,473
Look-- take a breath. Choose
your words carefully.

628
00:47:56,474 --> 00:47:59,743
The lord is with us.
Of course he's with us.

629
00:47:59,744 --> 00:48:00,000
Oh, no, no. He is with us here in auburn.
Yes, pat, he's with us here.

630
00:48:00,001 --> 00:48:03,513
Oh, no, no. He is with us here in auburn.
Yes, pat, he's with us here.

631
00:48:03,514 --> 00:48:05,982
And I know where he lives.
Oh, don't say it.

632
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:08,752
The people from the revival of angels
meeting are all talking about it.

633
00:48:08,753 --> 00:48:13,123
Joshua went to their tent last night and
healed a blind girl with his own hands.

634
00:48:13,124 --> 00:48:15,525
Another miracle. A revival tent?

635
00:48:15,526 --> 00:48:17,594
That's right. A miracle
in a revival tent?

636
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:19,996
That is right. I warned
you about this Joshua.

637
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:22,966
Hey, I'm not the only one.
Everyone says it's a miracle.

638
00:48:22,967 --> 00:48:26,236
What kind of priest is he
turning you into, Patrick?

639
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:29,999
I have kept my eyes open and my
vision clear, like you advised me to,

640
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,374
I have kept my eyes open and my
vision clear, like you advised me to,

641
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:32,642
and I have been seeing things.

642
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:36,212
Yes, but you're not
seeing the truth.

643
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:39,549
Joshua is a fraud, and you're a
fool to be corrupted by him.

644
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:44,154
Corrupted? No one's been corrupted.
Joshua's the genuine article.

645
00:48:44,155 --> 00:48:48,292
Beware of false prophets.

646
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:54,298
As soon as this Joshua completes the statue,
I want you to end your association with him.

647
00:48:57,668 --> 00:48:59,999
He's my friend.

648
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,600
He's my friend.

649
00:49:02,006 --> 00:49:05,241
Do you understand me,
father Hayes?

650
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:08,312
I understand what you're saying.

651
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:35,172
Good morning. Good morning.

652
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,755
Father tardone.

653
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:56,459
Good morning, bishop.
Thank you for seeing me.

654
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,329
I'll get right to the point.

655
00:49:59,330 --> 00:49:59,999
A young man recently moved into our area.
He seemed simple enough,

656
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,068
a young man recently moved into our area.
He seemed simple enough,

657
00:50:05,069 --> 00:50:09,506
but he's shown a powerful influence
over a great many people.

658
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:13,142
They think he's capable
of performing miracles.

659
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:16,079
The protestant clergy
and I would like...

660
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,482
To call a meeting
of all the clergy in auburn.

661
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:24,153
And the purpose of this meeting would
be to investigate these miracles?

662
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:28,658
Oh, no, no. We all have better
things to do with our time.

663
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:29,999
That I'm glad to hear.

664
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,361
That I'm glad to hear.

665
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:34,397
However, bishop,

666
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:39,536
when a man uses such talk of miracles
for his own gain-- for his own cult--

667
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:44,307
- This Joshua has done this?
- He lets others do it for him.

668
00:50:44,308 --> 00:50:48,077
Still, it's not as if this man
were a priest saying these things.

669
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:52,382
He's just a man, and he's free
to do and say as he wishes.

670
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:56,052
But, bishop, what he says
and does is disruptive.

671
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:59,289
My own father Hayes follows
him around like a lost puppy.

672
00:50:59,290 --> 00:50:59,999
This is a small fire,
father tardone.

673
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,327
This is a small fire,
father tardone.

674
00:51:04,328 --> 00:51:07,196
You don't need a meeting.

675
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:10,634
You need
to put out your own fires.

676
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:52,475
<i>Father tardone, hello.</i>

677
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:55,278
How are you?

678
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:59,450
I was hoping the statue of Peter was done.
You're in luck.

679
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:06,290
Father, meet Peter.

680
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:11,495
- I'll send someone by to pick it up.
- You're not pleased.

681
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:19,068
- The statue is fine.
- It's the artist you have a problem with.

682
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:22,038
I made a mistake
hiring you, Joshua.

683
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:27,244
I'm surprised you found time to finish your
work, considering all your other chores.

684
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:29,999
I suppose I don't think of them as chores.
You know, father,

685
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,516
I suppose I don't think of them as chores.
You know, father,

686
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:37,186
we could use your help
down at the baptist church.

687
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:40,724
<i>Why don't you come down
and join us?</i>

688
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:43,726
Join you?

689
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:46,063
Join you?

690
00:52:48,065 --> 00:52:51,167
I know exactly what
you're up to, Joshua.

691
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:54,505
It's the others
whose eyes are not open.

692
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:59,275
Father, their eyes are wide open.
To what?

693
00:52:59,276 --> 00:52:59,999
A miracle worker? I have
never made that claim.

694
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,046
A miracle worker? I have
never made that claim.

695
00:53:03,047 --> 00:53:09,086
No, you would never say that,
because we both know it's not true.

696
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:14,158
And I think it's time for
everyone else to find out.

697
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:29,999
Well, look what they've done.
It looks very nice.

698
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,441
Well, look what they've done.
It looks very nice.

699
00:53:31,442 --> 00:53:35,978
Yes, they've definitely made progress.
We'll see the truth.

700
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:38,048
Yes, yes.

701
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:42,518
<i>Father pat.</i>

702
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:46,456
Well, Joshua, I see you've
gathered your followers.

703
00:53:46,457 --> 00:53:51,260
I know most of you. Some of you
are even part of my parish,

704
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:55,565
<i>and I'm glad to see you here,
because I think...</i>

705
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:59,602
What Joshua has persuaded you to
do with this church is wonderful.

706
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:00,000
<i>But I want you all to look...</i>

707
00:54:00,001 --> 00:54:03,473
<i>But I want you all to look...</i>

708
00:54:03,474 --> 00:54:08,077
At this wonderful man
and ask yourselves,

709
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:12,215
"does anyone do something
for nothing?"

710
00:54:12,216 --> 00:54:18,020
Does a complete stranger offer to help
without wanting something in return?

711
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:22,593
Father tardone-- shall I tell them
what you're really preaching, Joshua?

712
00:54:24,695 --> 00:54:29,465
- Preaching?
- You all know this book.

713
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:29,999
It is the word of god.

714
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,536
It is the word of god.

715
00:54:33,537 --> 00:54:38,674
Joshua, you once told me you don't fear
god. I don't think you know what this is.

716
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:42,011
It's a love letter.

717
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:44,480
- A love letter?
- Yeah.

718
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:47,550
Isn't that the Bible's main
message, that god loves you?

719
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,987
What about sin and god's law?

720
00:54:50,988 --> 00:54:54,991
<i>You're not an ordained minister. How
dare you assume the role of the clergy?</i>

721
00:54:54,992 --> 00:54:59,195
Wait a minute. That-that-that's
not what's happening here.

722
00:54:59,196 --> 00:54:59,999
What Joshua has done
is a miracle.

723
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,465
What Joshua has done
is a miracle.

724
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:05,701
<i>Living next to each other didn't make
us neighbors. It certainly didn't...</i>

725
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:08,471
Make us care about
one another, did it?

726
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:12,074
<i>But by working together
here with Joshua--</i>

727
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:15,578
Look around you. We have become
a community. <i>His community.</i>

728
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:19,182
Led by him. This is how it starts.
I have seen it before.

729
00:55:19,183 --> 00:55:23,286
<i>Come on. You don't really believe
he's gonna start some kind of cult?</i>

730
00:55:23,287 --> 00:55:25,321
I do. He's a terrible threat.

731
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:29,358
If you are still so blinded by
your fear that you can't...

732
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:29,999
See the good in this man--

733
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,495
See the good in this man--

734
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:38,134
If you can look at this church and how
everybody here has changed for the better...

735
00:55:38,135 --> 00:55:41,170
And say, "this must be stopped"?

736
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:44,674
<i>No, no, no, no, no.
Whatever it is you stand for,</i>

737
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:49,112
father tardone, I don't want
to be a part of.

738
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:56,019
I can't.

739
00:56:00,224 --> 00:56:04,460
I won't wear this anymore.

740
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:08,031
I won't take it.

741
00:56:18,008 --> 00:56:22,312
You see? You see
what he has done?

742
00:56:24,615 --> 00:56:27,417
May god have mercy on you.

743
00:56:49,306 --> 00:56:52,309
You don't have to do it, pat.

744
00:56:55,479 --> 00:56:57,647
He's just afraid. No.

745
00:56:57,648 --> 00:56:59,999
No, it's not about father
tardone, not even about you.

746
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,186
No, it's not about father
tardone, not even about you.

747
00:57:05,489 --> 00:57:10,327
About this. It's me.
I'm the guy.

748
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:18,401
I am part of the clergy
in this town, and, uh,

749
00:57:18,402 --> 00:57:22,138
I believe in those people and
wanna be there for them,

750
00:57:22,139 --> 00:57:27,643
but I quit
because I'm too afraid.

751
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:29,999
I'm too-- I can't take
what's in here...

752
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,049
I'm too-- I can't take
what's in here...

753
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:36,018
And live by it and teach it.

754
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:39,522
So I might as well...

755
00:57:39,523 --> 00:57:42,592
Just accept that I suck
at being a priest.

756
00:57:44,728 --> 00:57:47,464
It's not true, pat.

757
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:53,369
What do you know about
being a priest, Joshua?

758
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:57,707
What do you know about the
responsibility I feel?

759
00:57:57,708 --> 00:57:59,999
You're just a guy. You're just a
guy who's trying to help out.

760
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,744
You're just a guy. You're just a
guy who's trying to help out.

761
00:58:01,745 --> 00:58:03,980
Same as you.

762
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:08,318
No, it's not that simple, because
I have to be more than that.

763
00:58:09,353 --> 00:58:12,054
There is so much
in here that I--

764
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:14,391
It just needs
to be understood, and--

765
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,528
I can't.

766
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:22,732
I can't be the one
to show them the way,

767
00:58:22,733 --> 00:58:24,968
'cause I'm the one
that's the failure.

768
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:36,712
You're wrong, pat.

769
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:38,615
It is that simple.

770
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,662
- Hi, Maggie.
- Hey, Joshua.

771
00:59:59,663 --> 01:00:00,000
<i>Made it just in time.</i>

772
01:00:00,001 --> 01:00:01,730
<i>Made it just in time.</i>

773
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:04,200
Now, Theo,

774
01:00:04,201 --> 01:00:06,368
since you're the first one
who came to help,

775
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:08,404
you should be the one
to put the bell on the steeple.

776
01:00:08,405 --> 01:00:12,508
Aw, thank you, j-Joshua.

777
01:00:12,509 --> 01:00:16,445
Hand it over, guys. I-I got it.

778
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,981
Take it easy, now.
That thing is big.

779
01:00:18,982 --> 01:00:20,750
It's a long way up there.

780
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:28,157
Praise our lord.

781
01:00:28,158 --> 01:00:29,999
Praise his... h-holy name.

782
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,262
Praise his... h-holy name.

783
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:00,000
No! No!

784
01:01:00,001 --> 01:01:00,501
No! No!

785
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:06,596
No!

786
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:07,691
Theo, can you hear me?

787
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,596
I know you can hear me.

788
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:16,065
I want you to listen.

789
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:18,500
You're gonna wake up.

790
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:22,571
Your work's not done. You've got
a whole lot more left to do.

791
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,708
Okay, now, come on.

792
01:02:26,176 --> 01:02:29,278
Let's just wake up.

793
01:02:29,279 --> 01:02:29,999
Come on, now.

794
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,114
Come on, now.

795
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:34,750
Wake up.

796
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,152
That's it.

797
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:39,022
That's it.

798
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:43,026
That's it.

799
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:49,331
What happened?

800
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:52,234
You fell off the roof.

801
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:54,271
Hey, pat,
you wanna give us a hand?

802
01:02:55,405 --> 01:02:57,607
Sit up. You'll be all right.

803
01:02:58,975 --> 01:02:59,999
Come on.

804
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,677
Come on.

805
01:03:05,048 --> 01:03:06,750
Come on.

806
01:03:09,419 --> 01:03:12,187
You all right?

807
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:14,523
I'm okay.

808
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:17,994
Thank you.

809
01:03:28,705 --> 01:03:29,999
What just happened here?

810
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:30,960
What just happened here?

811
01:03:36,613 --> 01:03:41,317
I mean, it's-it's possible he
survived the 40-foot fall...

812
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:43,619
And-and heart stop.

813
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:47,724
And they start again. I know that.
That happens. But you--

814
01:03:49,192 --> 01:03:53,395
You talked to,
and-and put your hands on...

815
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:57,600
A certifiably dead person and
you brought him back to life.

816
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:18,754
<i>Joshua had a way of making a person
see what was inside of them,</i>

817
01:04:18,755 --> 01:04:20,757
<i>and that even applied to me.</i>

818
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:26,095
Bless me, father, for I have sinned. It has
been one week since my last confession.

819
01:04:26,096 --> 01:04:28,997
What was your sin, my son?

820
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:29,999
I let my anger get in the way of my
calling. I turned my back on my vocation.

821
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,601
I let my anger get in the way of my
calling. I turned my back on my vocation.

822
01:04:32,602 --> 01:04:35,304
But I have overcome
my crisis of faith.

823
01:04:35,305 --> 01:04:38,173
And what has caused
this reversal?

824
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:41,377
You know what it is.
I am not resigning.

825
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:45,013
I know what I have seen,
and I know what I have to do.

826
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:47,549
So now this Joshua
has stolen my congregation?

827
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:52,121
You leave me no choice but to
involve Rome, pat. It's father pat!

828
01:04:52,122 --> 01:04:56,091
I promise you, father pat, the
Vatican shall know of this,

829
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:59,428
and when they do, this
miracle worker will vanish.

830
01:04:59,429 --> 01:04:59,999
He will simply run away.

831
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,264
He will simply run away.

832
01:05:02,265 --> 01:05:04,267
You're wrong about him,
father tardone.

833
01:05:33,563 --> 01:05:36,432
- Joshua?
<i>- Hey, Charlie.</i>

834
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:40,169
In all my years
as a postal employee,

835
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:42,404
I've never seen anything
so beautiful.

836
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:44,540
<i>What?</i> This isn't a letter.

837
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:46,408
It's a present. From who?

838
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:48,544
It's from the Vatican.

839
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:50,712
Special Vatican stamp
is right there.

840
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:53,282
Huh? You know, when
you visit the pope,

841
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:55,384
you're supposed to bring a gift.

842
01:05:55,385 --> 01:05:59,121
I don't know if I'll be visiting the
pope, but thanks for the etiquette tip.

843
01:05:59,122 --> 01:05:59,999
Do you think I could
get a picture with it?

844
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,691
Do you think I could
get a picture with it?

845
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:04,727
Well, sure,
if you've got a camera.

846
01:06:06,262 --> 01:06:09,666
I've got--
I've got one here.

847
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:15,437
You will be giving the sermon this
Sunday, and I shall be back in, uh,

848
01:06:15,438 --> 01:06:17,506
in less than a week.

849
01:06:17,507 --> 01:06:21,577
Hmm. Why are you going to Rome?

850
01:06:21,578 --> 01:06:24,714
If you must know, I've decided
to take my study now.

851
01:06:25,615 --> 01:06:28,317
I have you and your pancakes
to thank.

852
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:29,999
You know, Joshua
was invited to the Vatican.

853
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:30,719
You know, Joshua
was invited to the Vatican.

854
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:34,457
Really? I think I heard
some mention of that.

855
01:06:37,026 --> 01:06:39,461
<i>They won't let you in.</i>

856
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:42,731
I advise you to make the most
of your sermon, father pat.

857
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:45,535
It'll be a long time before
you're given your own parish.

858
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:34,250
Come on in.

859
01:07:35,585 --> 01:07:37,654
Hi.

860
01:07:39,088 --> 01:07:42,258
Maggie, hi.

861
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:47,062
Um, I just wanted to make sure
I said good-bye.

862
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:50,332
Oh, yeah, your new job.
Good luck with that.

863
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:54,736
No, act-- actually, I meant you...
In Rome.

864
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:59,274
I just assumed you
wouldn't be coming back.

865
01:07:59,275 --> 01:07:59,999
Yeah, I don't know.

866
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,245
Yeah, I don't know.

867
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:07,082
Actually, I'm being
a little nosey.

868
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,551
Um, I kind of wanted
to see where you lived.

869
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:13,255
Yeah? Well, here it is.

870
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:16,192
I sleep up there,
and I work over here.

871
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:21,063
It suits you somehow.

872
01:08:21,064 --> 01:08:23,065
Oh, wow.

873
01:08:23,066 --> 01:08:26,735
Wow, Joshua. This is lovely.
<i>Thanks.</i>

874
01:08:26,736 --> 01:08:29,038
It's yours.

875
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:32,408
And you know what's
the best part?

876
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:37,680
Come here. Look at that.

877
01:08:38,982 --> 01:08:41,550
<i>Oh, it's beautiful.</i>

878
01:08:41,551 --> 01:08:44,053
Isn't that something
in the moonlight?

879
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:48,057
Then why are you leaving?

880
01:08:51,561 --> 01:08:53,663
Why are you?

881
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:03,473
I'm not the one.

882
01:09:06,042 --> 01:09:09,511
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

883
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:12,114
No, Maggie--
No, I'm sorry. I'm--

884
01:09:12,115 --> 01:09:15,317
Wow. I'm, uh--
I misread. I--

885
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:17,319
I-I apologize. I really--

886
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:20,490
No. <i>I feel like an idiot.</i>

887
01:09:21,391 --> 01:09:24,359
I just...

888
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:27,162
Miss my husband, and, um--

889
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:29,999
This is so confusing. I--
My life is a mess.

890
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,720
This is so confusing. I--
My life is a mess.

891
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,203
Your life's not a mess, Maggie.

892
01:09:36,139 --> 01:09:38,274
Your life is beautiful.

893
01:09:39,442 --> 01:09:42,145
My life <i>was</i> beautiful.

894
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:47,750
It was great. It was whole.

895
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:51,120
Now it's--

896
01:09:52,655 --> 01:09:57,160
That is my life,
and it can't be fixed.

897
01:09:58,494 --> 01:09:59,999
I'm sorry.

898
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,630
I'm sorry.

899
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:18,980
<i>â™ª For he's a jolly good fellow â™ª</i>

900
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:23,018
â™ª for he's a jolly good fellow â™ª

901
01:10:23,019 --> 01:10:25,754

â™ª For he's a jolly good fellow â™ª

906

â™ª Which nobody can deny â™ª

907
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:44,406
Thank you, everyone.

908
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:46,709
That is a classic rendition
of that song.

909
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:52,247
And, um, I just can't
thank you all enough,

910
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:55,016
and I really appreciate it.

911
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:59,999
But, uh, I have to get up really early to catch
a plane tomorrow, so I'm gonna say good night.

912
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,720
But, uh, I have to get up really early to catch
a plane tomorrow, so I'm gonna say good night.

913
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:06,261
Theo. I'll miss you too.
I'll miss you.

914
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:09,531
Take care of yourself, will you?
Same. I will. Godspeed.

915
01:11:09,532 --> 01:11:12,300
Remember to lay off the pasta, Joshua.
Oh, yeah.

916
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:14,504
Those carbs will kill you.
I can see that, buddy.

917
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:20,675
Take care. Yep. You too.

918
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:23,111
<i>Joshua.</i> Joan,

919
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:25,214
it was delicious!

920
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:28,417
I had a good teacher.

921
01:11:30,186 --> 01:11:33,522
Will we see you again?
You never know.

922
01:11:33,523 --> 01:11:36,592
There's always a place for you.
I know that.

923
01:11:38,528 --> 01:11:40,729
Charlie. Take care.
Thanks for everything.

924
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:43,565
Hey, you too.
Send us a postcard.

925
01:11:43,566 --> 01:11:45,500
I will. You got it. Joshua.

926
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:47,569
Don't forget to send us
back some pictures.

927
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:52,140
Oh, great. I won't.
It's a promise. Okay.

928
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,442
Kevin. I never got another
chance to play with you.

929
01:11:54,443 --> 01:11:57,012
Yeah. We will, okay?
Soon enough.

930
01:11:57,013 --> 01:11:59,048
All right. Take care.
All right. You too.

931
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:03,084
Reverend. Joshua, the church
will be praying for you.

932
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:04,986
And I for you. Thank you.

933
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:07,089
You know that.

934
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:11,326
Mrs. munroe.
Take care, all right?

935
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,395
<i>I will.</i>

936
01:12:13,396 --> 01:12:15,264
Okay.

Pat.

938
01:12:22,038 --> 01:12:24,506
I was gonna stay here
and clean up.

939
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:27,076
You'll be doing
a lot more than that.

940

I'll be seeing you.

01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,380

<i>I remember I could not understand

986
01:15:23,052 --> 01:15:25,687
<i>I mean, he certainly
didn't have to.</i>

987
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:29,999
<i>But I now know that from the

988
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:30,493
<i>but I now know that from the
moment Joshua set foot in auburn,</i>

989
01:15:30,494 --> 01:15:33,362
<i>Rome was his destiny.</i>

990
01:15:59,255 --> 01:15:59,999
Ah, you must be Joshua.

991
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,123
Ah, you must be Joshua.

992
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:04,125
Welcome to the Vatican.

993
01:16:04,126 --> 01:16:06,429
I'm glad to be here.

994
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:11,533
An old friend, father tardone,

995
01:16:11,534 --> 01:16:15,170
<i>has told me what has been
happening in, uh,</i>

996
01:16:15,171 --> 01:16:18,173
auburn, I guess it is.

997
01:16:18,174 --> 01:16:22,110
From what I hear, you've been doing
some extraordinary things in auburn.

998
01:16:22,111 --> 01:16:24,980
No, cardinal, I've done
nothing extraordinary.

999
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:28,416
I came to auburn and saw
there was work to be done.

1000
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:29,999
- God's work?
- <i>You could say that.</i>

1001
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,753
- God's work?
- <i>You could say that.</i>

1002
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:35,423
I started to build
and people came to join me.

1003
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:39,594
You built a church,
as I understand it.

1004
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:44,333
- For what reason?
- I never thought I needed a reason.

1005
01:16:45,501 --> 01:16:49,537
So you don't
consider yourself a--

1006
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:51,474
A spiritual leader?

1007
01:16:52,675 --> 01:16:55,578
I am what I am.

1008
01:16:56,645 --> 01:16:59,999
You don't seem dangerous
or evil.

1009
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:00,483
You don't seem dangerous
or evil.

1010
01:17:00,484 --> 01:17:03,551
<i>Don't let him fool you,
cardinal.</i>

1011
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:07,422
He is not what he seems.
I know who you are.

1012
01:17:07,423 --> 01:17:10,125
On our friendship,

1013
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:13,061
this man is a danger.

1014
01:17:13,062 --> 01:17:17,065
I beg a formal condemnation
of him by the Vatican.

1015
01:17:17,066 --> 01:17:20,702
<i>I believe he is leading
our people away from god.</i>

1016
01:17:20,703 --> 01:17:25,106
<i>Father tardone, if you honestly believe
that I'm some sort of false prophet...</i>

1017
01:17:25,107 --> 01:17:29,010
Who's come to auburn
to mislead people,

1018
01:17:29,011 --> 01:17:29,999
<i>then I accept your condemnation.</i>

1019
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,045
<i>Then I accept your condemnation.</i>

1020
01:17:31,046 --> 01:17:33,314
But is that truly
what you see in me?

1021
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:35,550
It is.

1022
01:17:35,551 --> 01:17:38,686
I fear you are out
to hurt my people.

1023
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:43,325
That's not what
you're afraid of, is it?

1024
01:17:45,194 --> 01:17:47,329
You don't fear me?

1025
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:51,432
You fear what's inside of you.

1026
01:17:51,433 --> 01:17:54,537
How do you know
what's inside of me?

1027
01:17:55,471 --> 01:17:57,606
You're afraid to love.

1028
01:18:00,242 --> 01:18:02,278
No, that's not true.

1029
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:06,682
Don't be afraid.

1030
01:18:08,217 --> 01:18:10,119
What are you doing?

1031
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:24,099
Oh, my lord.

1032
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:29,999
I'm so sorry.

1033
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:30,606
I'm so sorry.

1034
01:18:39,148 --> 01:18:41,350
Please forgive me.

1035
01:18:57,466 --> 01:18:59,999
Cardinal riccardo
saw what I saw.

1036
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:00,501
Cardinal riccardo
saw what I saw.

1037
01:19:00,502 --> 01:19:04,539
And now... You'll have an
audience with the pope.

1038
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:06,675
I look forward to it.

1039
01:19:07,977 --> 01:19:11,247
You'll be meeting with him too.
Hmm.

1040
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:14,250
Soon.

1041
01:19:16,552 --> 01:19:19,588
The cardinal saw
the change in you.

1042
01:19:20,990 --> 01:19:23,758
He knows the good work
you've been doing...

1043
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:25,628
Here.

1044
01:19:29,999 --> 01:19:30,000
Is that so?

1045
01:19:30,001 --> 01:19:32,400
Is that so?

1046
01:19:32,401 --> 01:19:34,536
Father pat gets his parish...

1047
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:38,406
And I get my dream?

1048
01:19:38,407 --> 01:19:40,542
So it would seem.

1049
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:47,616
I think--

1050
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:51,320
I think I'm happier
for father pat.

1051
01:19:59,228 --> 01:19:59,999
Joshua, if I may,

1052
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,764
Joshua, if I may,

1053
01:20:04,066 --> 01:20:06,035
what will you tell the pope?

1054
01:20:09,605 --> 01:20:12,308
I'll say the same thing
I've been saying.

1055
01:20:43,272 --> 01:20:45,374
Joshua.

1056
01:20:48,077 --> 01:20:50,311
It's a great pleasure
to meet you.

1057
01:20:50,312 --> 01:20:54,015
I've heard many things
about you.

1058
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:57,152
Cardinal riccardo
was very impressed by you.

1059
01:20:58,420 --> 01:20:59,999
I brought you a gift.

1060
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:00,840
I brought you a gift.

1061
01:21:02,091 --> 01:21:04,093
These are some tools
that I work with.

1062
01:21:11,967 --> 01:21:16,538
Ah, yes. We have
much work to be done.

1063
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:20,409
Sit down.

1064
01:21:25,481 --> 01:21:28,117
I wanted to thank you for the
pledge you made as a child.

1065
01:21:30,386 --> 01:21:32,454
My pledge?

1066
01:21:33,489 --> 01:21:35,991
When your sister was ill.

1067
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:39,494
When she was near death...

1068
01:21:39,495 --> 01:21:43,198
And you spent the entire night in the
loft of your father's barn praying.

1069
01:21:45,534 --> 01:21:49,237
Then the next morning
she was well.

1070
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:52,241
You went to the top of a hill and
you pledged your life to god.

1071
01:21:55,177 --> 01:21:57,311
Who are you?

1072
01:21:57,312 --> 01:21:59,999
Peter, don't you know me?

1073
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,616
Peter, don't you know me?

1074
01:22:01,617 --> 01:22:04,419
The world has become
such a frightening place.

1075
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:06,454
There's so much anger
and not enough love.

1076
01:22:06,455 --> 01:22:11,360
Deep in the hearts of so many
people is an emptiness...

1077
01:22:12,461 --> 01:22:15,097
That nothing of this world
can fill.

1078
01:22:16,565 --> 01:22:20,402
And that emptiness makes it
impossible for them to love.

1079
01:22:25,307 --> 01:22:27,276
It's so overwhelming.

1080
01:22:28,577 --> 01:22:29,999
What should I do?

1081
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:30,712
What should I do?

1082
01:22:32,014 --> 01:22:35,016
Remind them that I love them--

1083
01:22:35,017 --> 01:22:37,552
That I died for them.

1084
01:22:37,553 --> 01:22:39,554
Tell them that my love
is real...

1085
01:22:39,555 --> 01:22:42,390
And that if they open their hearts
to it, I will fill that emptiness,

1086
01:22:42,391 --> 01:22:46,060
and they will be able
to love one another.

1087
01:22:46,061 --> 01:22:47,996
That's the message.

1088
01:22:49,097 --> 01:22:51,066
It hasn't changed.

1089
01:22:53,602 --> 01:22:56,304
Tell them, Peter.

1090
01:22:56,305 --> 01:22:58,440
Tell them.

1091
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:45,419
<i>Life teaches us many lessons,</i>

1092
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:50,458
<i>and Joshua certainly taught us some wonderful
ones about love and understanding.</i>

1093
01:23:50,459 --> 01:23:53,494
<i>But now I'd like to examine one
of the lessons from the Bible.</i>

1094
01:23:53,495 --> 01:23:59,200
Today I want to talk about Peter,
the fisherman, a man I relate to,

1095
01:23:59,201 --> 01:23:59,999
because it seems like every time he opened
his mouth, he stuck his foot into it.

1096
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,160
Because it seems like every time he opened
his mouth, he stuck his foot into it.

1097
01:24:05,607 --> 01:24:08,209
So let's say "amen" for Theo.

1098
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:10,978
Amen.

1099
01:24:10,979 --> 01:24:13,581
Thank you, reverend.

1100
01:24:13,582 --> 01:24:16,050
Giving honor and praise to god,

1101
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:18,753
for without his love and mercy,

1102
01:24:18,754 --> 01:24:21,989
surely I would not be
standing before you all today.
