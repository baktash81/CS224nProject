I know. It's okay.

351
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,454
No. It sure as hell is not okay.

352
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:12,949
Dad, it wasn't his fault.

353
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:15,083
You could've been killed.
You understand that?

354
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:17,320
Yes. But I wasn't, so...

355
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:21,092
You can kiss your license goodbye.

356
00:23:21,165 --> 00:23:23,793
- I heard the chief's daughter was here.
- CHARLIE: Dr. Cullen.

357
00:23:23,868 --> 00:23:25,233
Charlie.

358
00:23:25,603 --> 00:23:27,696
I've got this one, Jackie.

359
00:23:28,806 --> 00:23:30,103
Isabella.

360
00:23:30,908 --> 00:23:31,897
Bella.

361
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,245
Well, Bella, looks like you took quite a spill.
How do you feel?

362
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:36,473
Good.

363
00:23:37,248 --> 00:23:38,613
Look here.

364
00:23:39,617 --> 00:23:43,644
You might experience some
post-traumatic stress or disorientation,

365
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:45,621
but your vitals look good.

366
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,783
No signs of any head trauma.

367
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,383
I think you'll be just fine.

368
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,928
TYLER: I'm so sorry, Bella. I'm really...

369
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:56,291
You know,
it would've been a whole lot worse

370
00:23:56,367 --> 00:23:59,234
if Edward wasn't there.
He knocked me out of the way.

371
00:23:59,303 --> 00:24:01,396
Edward? Your boy?

372
00:24:02,006 --> 00:24:03,371
Yeah, it was amazing.

373
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:06,205
I mean, he got to me so fast.
He was nowhere near me.

374
00:24:06,277 --> 00:24:08,370
Sounds like you were very lucky.

375
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:09,743
Charlie.

376
00:24:13,818 --> 00:24:16,981
I gotta go sign some paperwork.
You should...

377
00:24:17,688 --> 00:24:20,122
You should probably call your mom.

378
00:24:20,191 --> 00:24:21,818
Did you tell her?

379
00:24:24,662 --> 00:24:26,562
(GROANS) She's probably just

380
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:29,359
freaking out.

381
00:24:30,601 --> 00:24:32,000
ROSALIE: Fifteen kids that saw
what happened.

382
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,630
EDWARD: What was I supposed to do, then?
Let her die?

383
00:24:34,705 --> 00:24:37,401
This isn't just about you. It's about all of us.

384
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:40,273
CARLISLE: I think we should
take this in my office.

385
00:24:42,313 --> 00:24:45,282
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Rosalie.

386
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:52,754
What?

387
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:58,493
How did you get over to me so fast?

388
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:01,031
I was standing right next to you, Bella.

389
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:04,899
No. You were next to your car,
across the lot.

390
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:07,095
No, I wasn't.

391
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,065
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

392
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,269
Yes, you were.

393
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:16,177
Bella, you're... You hit your head.

394
00:25:16,247 --> 00:25:18,010
I think you're confused.

395
00:25:18,082 --> 00:25:19,515
I know what I saw.

396
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:21,711
And what exactly was that?

397
00:25:22,553 --> 00:25:23,918
You...

398
00:25:25,656 --> 00:25:27,590
You stopped the van.

399
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,855
You pushed it away with your hand.

400
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:34,526
Well, nobody's gonna believe you, so...

401
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,995
I wasn't gonna tell anybody.

402
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,103
I just need to know the truth.

403
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,938
Can't you just thank me and get over it?

404
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:46,867
Thank you.

405
00:25:48,312 --> 00:25:51,042
- You're not gonna let this go, are you?
- No.

406
00:25:51,115 --> 00:25:54,084
Well, then I hope you enjoy disappointment.

407

- Yeah.

Come on, get in. In. Let's go!

414

Look at you, huh? You're alive.

415
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:01,342
- I know, yeah. False alarm, I guess.
- Yeah.

416
00:27:01,819 --> 00:27:05,186
Now, I wanted to ask you,
you know, if, you know,

417
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:06,951
it's like a month away, but...

Do you wanna go to prom with me?

420
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:17,226
So, what do you think?

421
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,236
- About what?
- Do you want to go?

422
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,673
To prom?

423
00:27:23,741 --> 00:27:25,402

Prom.

427
00:27:31,015 --> 00:27:32,414
Dancing.

428
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,179
Not such a good idea for me.

429
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:39,253
I have something that weekend anyway.

430
00:27:39,323 --> 00:27:41,257
I'm going to Jacksonville that weekend.

431
00:27:41,325 --> 00:27:43,293
You can't go another weekend?

432
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:45,261
Non-refundable ticket.

433
00:27:46,063 --> 00:27:48,122
You should ask Jessica.

434
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:50,167
I know she wants to go with you.

435
00:27:50,234 --> 00:27:51,997
All right. All right.

Compost is cool.
Now, stuff that in there, Eric.

442
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:10,409
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
- Very good, very good.

443
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:15,858
Now, I am gonna make a steaming cup
of compost tea.

444

- Okay.
- Give me that.

445
00:28:17,361 --> 00:28:21,263
Yeah. This is recycling
in its most basic form, guys.

Don't drink it! It's for the plants.

00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:30,834
How did you know about that?

449
00:28:31,942 --> 00:28:34,172
You didn't answer my question.

450
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:37,176
You don't answer any of mine, so...

I mean, you don't even say hi to me.

Hi.

Are you gonna tell me
how you stopped the van?

454
00:28:45,856 --> 00:28:48,757
Yeah. I had an adrenaline rush.

455
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:51,887
It's very common. You can Google it.

456
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:57,528
Floridians.

457
00:28:57,601 --> 00:28:59,899
That's what's in Jacksonville.

458
00:29:00,471 --> 00:29:03,235
Can you at least watch where you walk?

459
00:29:06,243 --> 00:29:10,009
Look, I'm sorry I'm being rude all the time.
I just think it's the best way.

Who?

Yeah, I actually totally thought
that Mike was gonna ask you.

- It's not gonna be weird, though, right?
- No. Zero weirdness.

You really should've figured
that out a little earlier.

471
00:29:45,349 --> 00:29:46,941
I mean, why didn't you just
let the van crush me

472

and save yourself all this regret?

Well, that's your fault.

about the "almost" accident. You finished?

Yeah.

What does that mean?

511
00:31:47,471 --> 00:31:50,872
It means if you were smart,
you'd stay away from me.

Okay, well, let's say for argument's sake
that I'm not smart.

I can see what you're trying to put off,

521

but I can see that it's just
to keep people away from you.

522
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:25,766
It's a mask.
