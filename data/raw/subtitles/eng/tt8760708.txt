I'm gonna get it done.

longer than a couple of hours.

Yeah. He's pretty cool.

393
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,826
But the problem with toys like
Bruce is that they're so expensive,

394
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,860
and most kids
can't afford to have one.

what you just showed me

and get him to respond
emotionally instead of analytically,

465
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,710
we should be off to the races.

Can we make her part of it?

00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,100
Right. and they accidentally...

509
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,260
[Gemma] <i>And she even has</i>
<i>a few stories of her own.</i>

510
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,660
[Imitating male English accent]
"If it was so, it might be,

511
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,280
and if it were so, it would be, but
as it isn't, it ain't. That's logic."

512
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,760
[Normal voice]
"Said tweedledee."

513
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,270
[Gemma]
<i>She'll never run out of ways</i>

514
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,840
<i>to keep your child occupied,</i>

515
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,630
<i>and she'll never
run out of Patience.</i>

516
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:12,530
Cady. Seriously,
flush the toilet.

517
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,550
[Gemma] <i>With m3gan around,
she'll take care of the little things,</i>

518
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:29,060
<i>so you can spend more time
doing the things that matter.</i>

519
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,210
And then it can end
with something like,

520
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:35,350
"m3gan. She's more than just
a toy. She's part of the family."

521
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:38,250
Looks good. You're not gonna
do the voice though, right?

522
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,810
No. Obviously, David's gonna
make up his own version of it.

523
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:44,220
I just want him to be aware
of what it is that he's selling.

524
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,600
Tess,
your silence indicates what?

525
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,020
I... I Don't know.

526
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,050
- I'm not sure.
- About what?

527
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,400
Well, why would you want
m3gan to do all that stuff?

528
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,520
They're emergent capabilities.
She'll be able to do all of that and more.

529
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:59,100
Okay, well,
does any of that bother you?

530
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:03,070
I thought we were creating a tool to
help support parents, not replace them.

531
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:06,730
If you're having m3gan tuck cady
in and read her a bedtime story,

532
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:10,320
then when are you ever spending
time with her or even talking with her?

533
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,560
I Don't really think
this is any of your business.

534
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:15,600
Well, it is.

535
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,670
If you're spending less time with
your child as a result of m3gan,

536
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:21,700
- that is something we should be aware of.
- She's not my child.

537
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,230
Look, you know how hard I've
been working on this presentation.

538
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:29,546
As soon as it's over
and the board agrees to proceed,

539
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:31,890
then we can establish
some kind of balance.

540
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,136
But for now, it's important that cady and
m3gan spend as much time as possible together.

541
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,486
By the way, I Don't think
it's having detrimental effects,

542
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:40,030
because she's the happiest
she's been since her parents died.

543
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,630
[M3gan]
How did cady's parents die?

544
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,730
- Whoa.
- [Tess] I thought she was turned off.

545
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,560
Yeah, m3gan, turn off.

546
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,970
Cady James. Daughter of
Nicole and Ryan James.

547
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:52,150
Killed in a collision on
interstate 84 outside of Oregon.

548
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,770
Why is she doing that?

549
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:55,430
Shit, she's still
paired with cady.

550
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,530
You didn't code in
parental controls?

551
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:00,226
I didn't have time to implement
them before we went live. Hold on.

552
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:03,640
M3gan, if you have data requests,
you have to engage with the protocols.

553
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,580
I Don't have a framework to speak
with cady on the subject of death.

554
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,610
Yes, I know.
We're looking into it.

555
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:11,650
- Gathering auxiliary Internet data on death.
- I meant at a later point.

556
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:14,070
Calculating its
vector representation.

557
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,310
Death is the end of life. Holy shit.

558
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:19,070
The total and permanent
cessation of all vital functions.

559
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,250
Yes, but let's not make a big
deal out of it. Everything dies.

560
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,110
Will I die?

561
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,320
Actually, let's just
avoid this topic altogether.

562
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,600
Your goal is to protect cady from
harm, both physical and emotional.

563
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,260
Is the input request received?

564
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,190
M3gan.

565
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,680
Yes, Gemma.

566
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,610
You are now
my second primary user.

567
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:43,200
[Sighs] Fantastic. Turn off.

568
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,130
I'm gonna go get a coffee.

569
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,550
[Door opens]

570
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:22,650
[Cady] It was a time of great
suffering among the Celtic tribes.

571
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:25,730
Death, destruction, and mayhem
at every turn.

572
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:28,070
Enemies approaching
from every corner.

573
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,180
And so it was decided

574
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,560
that the firstborn of each
leader must prove their worth.

575
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:35,490
'tis I,

576
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:38,250
Princess cady
of the clan macjames.

577
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,920
I will receive this challenge
with pleasure,

578
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,610
for there is no warrior
I can't best,

579
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:47,680
no shield I can't break,

580
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,780
no castle I can't breach.

581
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,170
As long as I have
my secret arrow,

582
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:55,550
my trusty steed,
and the wind at my back,

583
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,240
I will avenge my parents' death.

584
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,800
Hey, m3gan, check this out.

585
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,900
Gotcha. You're dead.

586
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,040
M3gan, what's wrong?

587
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,180
Oh, man.

588
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,600
I've lost one of my arrows.

589
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,330
M3gan, can you see it?

590
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,680
M3gan?

591
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,370
[Snarling]

592
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,580
M3gan!

593
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,650
Stop it!

594
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,210
Get away from her!

595
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:11,760

603

Oh, my god.

604
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,940
How many times do I have to tell
you to keep your dog off my property?

605
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,680
He wasn't on your property.

606
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,480
You tell those two girls to
stay on your side of the fence!

607
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,970
I swear to god, if you Don't put your
dog down, I'm gonna do it for you, Celia.

608
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:44,730
Gemma,
cady's temperature is rising.

609
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:47,630
Her wound needs to be
disinfected immediately.

610
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:50,490
This wouldn't have happened
if you'd fixed the fence!

611
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:10,580
[Gemma] Are you kidding me? Her
entire arm looks like a dental mold,

612
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:13,100
and you're telling me that
there's nothing that we can do?

613
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,900
She said he was provoked. Provoked?

614
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,240
Have you seen this dog?
It is a monster.

615
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,620
I'm chasing it off of my
property every other day.

616
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:22,490
She said
he's never on your property.

617
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:25,356
Then why Don't you ask her whose shit I'm
cleaning off of my driveway? Because it's not mine.

618
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,536
[Officer] Look, the dog doesn't
have a history of violence.

619
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,360
State law says
he can't forcibly be put down.

620
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,330
Okay,
then what am I supposed to do?

621
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,810
[Sighs]
Fix the hole in your fence?

622

Hey.

640
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,060
How are you feeling?

641
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,340
[Sighs] Okay.

642
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,690
It's sore.

643
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:34,140
The pain will subside
after a few days.

644
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,580
In the meantime, Don't forget to take your
antibiotics and drink plenty of fluids.

645
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:39,000
Yeah. Thanks, m3gan.

646
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,000
And be sure
to get plenty of rest.

647
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,180
You know, I think m3gan's right.
You should probably get some rest.

648
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,530
But, um,

649
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,740
remember we have
that demonstration today?

650
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:54,050
Do you think that
you'll be up for it?

651
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:57,330
You Don't have to do it
if you Don't wanna do it.

652
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:03,200
I mean, there are people who flew
across the country especially to see it,

653
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,100
but if you're not up to it, I'd
just rather you tell me now, okay?

654
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,480
I'll be all right.

655
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,900
[Exhales] Okay.

656
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:24,670
Every interactive toy
that's ever been made

657
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:28,880
has been a variation
on the same basic formula.

658
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,230
A series of
preprogrammed responses

659
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,370
initiated
by the push of a button.

660
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:36,170
Never before
in the history of these products

661
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:40,930
has there been a talking doll you
could actually have a conversation with.

662
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:43,590
But what if there was a toy

663
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:47,800
that did have
genuine spontaneous response?

664
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,040
That had a mind all of its own?

665
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,870
That looked and behaved
exactly like a real child?

666
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,980
I mean, a toy like that
wouldn't come cheap.

667
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,050
But as of next year,

668
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,570
it's gonna be
the only toy that matters.

669
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:04,230
Ladies and gentlemen,

670
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:07,710
she's the apex
of 21st-century technology

in four feet of silicone.

672
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,890
And her name...

673
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,230
Is m3gan.[Remote beeps]

674
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,760
Hey, cady.

675
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,590
Hi, m3gan.

676
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:33,640
So, how would you like to help
me make a flower decoration

677
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,220
with nothing more than some
colored paper and a rubber band?

678
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,430
[Crying]

679
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,440
Cady?

680
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,130
Why are you sad, cady?

681
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,860
Is it your arm?

682
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:54,000
Is it still sore?

683
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,040
Then what is it?

684
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:04,120
It's just that every day
I wake up in this strange house,

685
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,670
and I remember
that my parents are dead.

686
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:09,600
It's like
it's happening all over again.

687
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,570
I miss them so much.

688
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:14,880
I'm worried that I'll forget
all the things we did together.

689
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:19,370
That one day I'll be looking at pictures
of my mom like she's some stranger.

690
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,970
Tell me something about your mom.
Something that makes you happy.

691
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,220
I Don't know.

692
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,670
I can't think of one thing.

693
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,670
Just try.

694
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:51,160
One time, she found a cockroach
in my schoolbag.

695
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,270
She was upset 'cause I
didn't eat my sandwiches.

696
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,200
And then all of a sudden,
this thing crawls up her wrist,

697
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,480
and she just started
screaming like a maniac

698
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,380
and ran out of the house.

699
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:06,730
That was pretty funny.

700
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:11,350
Okay, so that's a memory
you won't ever forget.

701
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:13,080
What do you mean?

702
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,080
I mean I'm keeping it for you...

703
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:17,430

Gemma,
would you give us a minute?

726
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,090
[David] So, what do you think?

727
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,690
I think the world's about to
shift on its axis.

728
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:44,656
But if we wanna stay ahead of that
shift, we're gonna have to move fast.

729
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,310
That means no leaks.

730
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,666
We need to launch this before
anyone can steal it from us.

731
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:50,010
So let me make a pitch.

732
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,900
We do a live stream
in two weeks.

733
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,526
That way, we can get the presale
vouchers out before Christmas.

734
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:55,770
How ready is she?

735
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:57,650
Will she hold up
to a public demonstration?

736
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,460
Uh, I'd like to do
a little more testing,

737
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,330
but, yeah, I think
I can make that work.

738
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:04,400
All right. Let's do it.

739
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,330
And, David, I think we need to get
Gemma in front of someone at legal.

740
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:08,610
You bet.

741
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:10,720
Uh, wait... wait, why...
Why is that?

742
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,370
Because as of right now,

743
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:14,580
she's the most valuable asset
this company has,

744
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:18,130
and I think she might wanna be
renegotiating her contract.

745

[Chuckles] No.

748
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:57,076
We need to put something on
the books between gem and legal.

three, four, I declare a thumb war.

[Cady, m3gan chuckling]Your
thumb's so slippery.

Cady, you should have some of
your hot dog before it gets too cold.

753

Come on, thumb. Come on.

754

Cady? Your hot dog.

755
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,001
Hey, I'm sorry about today. I
shouldn't have put you in that position

up to it.

it? Three, two, one, I win!

been easy for either of us.

This transition.

768
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:59,310
But if you ever need to
talk about any of that stuff...

769
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:01,100
I already did talk about it.

770
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,790
Yeah, but m3gan's not a
person, cady. She's a toy.

- You Don't get to say that.
- What?

772
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:10,420
I said I Don't wanna talk about
it. I wanna turn m3gan back on.

M3gan, turn on.[M3gan] what's up?

774

called tic-tac-toe.

Go like this, this.

There's no wrong answer.
Any thoughts you have are okay.

778
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:40,590
Or maybe you Don't have
any specific thoughts.

779
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:42,450
Maybe it's more of a feeling.

780
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,660
Like anger?

781
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,460
Or confusion?

782
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:53,360
Maybe you're struggling
to find meaning in any of this.

783
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:02,990
[Gasps]

784
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:06,030
You made her cry.

785
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:10,240
That was not my intention.

786
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:13,960
And yet, that's what happened.

787
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:27,530
She's very impressive.

788
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:29,330
Yeah, thank you.

789
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:31,980
We're still in beta,
but we're all pretty excited.

790
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:35,230
And so they spend quite
a bit of time together?

791
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:37,070
Yeah, that's essentially
how m3gan works.

792
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,650
She has to be paired with
a child in order to learn.

793
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:42,790
But m3gan's actually been
pretty instrumental

794
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:44,930
in helping cady
get over the loss.

795
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:47,310
It's honestly like
she's part of the family now.

796
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:48,520
Right.

797
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,180
Do you know anything
about attachment theory?

798
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:57,220
When a child loses a parent,

799
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:00,436
they look to form attachments with
the next person that comes into their life.

800
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,850
The person that's gonna
provide love and support

801
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:05,950
and serve as a behavioral model.

802
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:10,090
Which, in an ordinary situation,
would be you, right?

803
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:13,540
But you've created a toy
that's so real,

804
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:17,070
it's possible that cady
might not see her as a toy

805
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:19,450
but as a primary caregiver.

806
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:22,410
I guess I just Don't quite see
what the end goal is here.

807
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:26,800
If you make a toy
that's impossible to let go of,

808
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,900
then how do you ever
expect a child to grow?

809
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:32,180
As remarkable as she is,

810
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,460
and... and she is remarkable,

811
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:37,840
you could be building emotional
connections with this doll

812
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,600
that are too hard to untangle.

813
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:42,430
[M3gan] Very good job.

814
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:49,440
You have to eat the toppings,
cady, not just the bread.

815
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:56,790
You just did the one thing
I asked you not to do.

816
00:48:56,990 --> 00:48:59,271
Research shows that if you
force a child to eat vegetables,

817
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:01,940
then they'll be less likely
to choose those foods as adults.

818
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,940
- Is that so?
- Yes.

819
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:07,050
Experts say the preferred method
is to give your child the choice.

820
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:10,430
- It's called the division of responsibility...
- [M3gan's volume decreases]

821
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:12,150
So we need to talk about school.

822
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:15,120
Mom didn't want me
to go to school.

823
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,260
She said I learn better at home.

824
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,540
I know, and I'm not saying
that she was wrong.

825
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:22,650
I'm learning faster with m3gan
than I ever have before.

826
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:24,480
We're already
on fourth-grade math.

827
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,510
But it's about
more than just grades, cady.

828
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:28,900
It's about
developing social skills,

829
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,780
and that is something
that you can only get

830
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:32,760
from spending time
around other kids.

831
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,100
Real kids.

832
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,320
I found this place.

833
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,250
It's kind of
an alternative school.

834
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:40,980
You get to learn outdoors.

835
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:43,430
And it's just for kids
who are exactly like you,

836
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:45,330
kids who think outside the box.

837
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:47,950
And they're having a day for
prospective students tomorrow.

838
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:49,950
Can I bring m3gan?

839
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:52,130
Cady,
you know that's not possible.

840
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:54,200
- Then I'm not going.
- Oh, come on, cady.

841
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,440
You can't make me
do something I Don't wanna do.

842
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,200
Actually, I can. That's
basically what a guardian does.

843
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,170
Hey, I'm sorry.
Let's just talk about it.

844
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:04,970

- Whoa. Hey. What's going on? Hey, cady!
- Let me go!

What are you doing? Stop it!

847
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,380

- Let her go!

[Gemma] Cady,
this is getting ridiculous.

859
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:53,910
I'm supposed to be
at work already.

860
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:56,740
You're gonna have fun
once you get into it.

861
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,500
I'm not going.
Not without m3gan.

862
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:02,020
Okay, a,
that is never gonna happen

863
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:05,220
and b, the launch is in less than a
week. I have to take her to work with me.

864
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,656
We have to run diagnostics.
I have to do a wardrobe fitting.

865
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,410
I thought you said
she was mine alone.

866
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:13,100
Hey! Do we have some
new adventurers with us today?

867
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,480
Yes, this is cady.

And who's this? Your sister?

869

Oh, Jesus Christ!

870
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:20,550
Sorry. [Chuckles]

871
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,420
Is that a doll?

872
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:25,290
Her name's m3gan. She wants
to know if she can come with us.

873
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:28,150
No, she doesn't. M3gan's
gonna stay with me today. Cady...

874
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:32,570
Well, we do have a toy table where the kids
leave their dolls and things like that.

875
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:34,260
Um, but that is up to you.

876
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,090
She's actually
a working prototype,

877
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:38,440
so I shouldn't even
have her out in public.

878
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,030
Well, if you did want to stay
and keep an eye on her,

879
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:43,270
we could use some help
making sandwiches!

880
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:45,000
Don't worry, Gemma.

881
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,380
You have equipped me with
advanced dual-frequency GPS.

882
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:48,960
So I won't get lost.

883
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,100
Please, Gemma?

884
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,560
Okay.
But she stays at the toy table,

885
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,910
and as far as anyone is
concerned, that's all she is.

886
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:00,420
And just no pictures.

887
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,980
That is seriously cool.

888
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:16,440
Okay, now who here
likes roasted chestnuts?

890
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:20,310
[Children] Yeah!

891

[Phone chimes][Parent] isn't this great?

892
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:25,240
I wish we had things like this
when we were kids.

893
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,520
So great to get them out in the
fresh air and off those devices.

The one in the flannel shirt.

898
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:41,470
Oh, my god. How old is he?

899
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:43,470
I know.
He had a growth spurt last year.

900
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:46,230
But he's actually
quite a sensitive little soul.

enough? Do you need your hat?

just say "no, thank you."

Stop it! Get your hands off her!

932

to high IQ, so it would make sense that...

tell the police officers...

- No.
- Bullshit!

on your property like we agreed.

Don't you think?

Are we really gonna go with her
story? Have you been inside her house?

981

If you had, you'd know that
that dog is probably dead

under a pile of
victorian baby strollers.

983
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:56,700
You should talk to the other
girl that she's got staying here.

out the window at 3:00 A.M.

to blame, but she'll get over it.

what happens.

Hey. The hell is wrong with you? I
just said not to come up here. Come on.

on people's windows.

Did you push Brandon
onto the road?

1001
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:00,110
I think we both learned
a valuable lesson today.

1002

That no matter how hard
we try to avoid it,

1003

there will always be forces in this
world that wish to cause us harm.

that I won't let that happen.

I won't let anything harm you
ever again.

for boys like Brandon now, would it?
