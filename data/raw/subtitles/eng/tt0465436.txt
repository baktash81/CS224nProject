1
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,638
Hello.

2
00:01:36,813 --> 00:01:39,008
<i>When I think about that time...</i>

3
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:43,016
<i>... it's not the heat,</i>
<i>the dust, the nuns...</i>

4
00:01:43,653 --> 00:01:46,053
<i>... or even the boys I remember...</i>

5
00:01:46,222 --> 00:01:49,487
<i>... so much as a sense of anticipation.</i>

6
00:01:50,827 --> 00:01:55,526
<i>The constant belief</i>
<i>that somehow I'd be saved.</i>

7
00:02:23,693 --> 00:02:26,594
<i>I wouldn't say we had it bad...</i>

8
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,058
<i>... since it was all most of us knew.</i>

9
00:02:30,934 --> 00:02:33,926
<i>It was only there was something</i>
<i>just out of reach...</i>

10
00:02:34,103 --> 00:02:36,196
<i>... and we might never catch up.</i>

11
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:05,628
Lights out, boys.

12
00:03:10,807 --> 00:03:14,573
May you be blessed
and sleep with God's benevolent grace.

13
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,245
Amen.

14
00:03:32,929 --> 00:03:34,988
Sparks.

15
00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:07,056
Someone's coming.

16
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:49,267
<i>I don't remember who wrote</i>
<i>"I love a sunburnt country"...</i>

17
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,539
<i>... but I'd bet money</i>
<i>they never lived out here.</i>

18
00:04:53,743 --> 00:04:58,544
<i>Just look at it.</i>
<i>It's the definition of desolate.</i>

19
00:04:58,748 --> 00:05:02,184
<i>This is where I lived</i>
<i>most of my young years.</i>

20
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,081
<i>This is where I lived until,</i>
<i>you could say...</i>

21
00:05:05,254 --> 00:05:07,279
<i>... I was rescued by a dream.</i>

22
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:19,763
<i>These were my best friends.</i>

23
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:24,464
<i>Spark, Spit and Maps.</i>

24
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,940
<i>My real name's Vernon,</i>
<i>but they call me Misty.</i>

25
00:05:29,145 --> 00:05:31,443
<i>No reason to go into that right now.</i>

26
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:35,918
Today's the first of December...

27
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:39,611
...the December boys
please come forward.

28
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:43,584
<i>They say the best place to start</i>
<i>is the beginning.</i>

29
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,662
<i>So, first off, you better know</i>
<i>we were all orphans.</i>

30
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:52,263
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks, Sister.

31
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,596
Thanks, Sister.

32
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,398
Thank you.

33
00:05:58,574 --> 00:06:00,132
Everybody ready?

34
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:13,784
It's about the smokes.

35
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,151
I told you
she looks under the mattress.

36
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:20,091
- I didn't put them there.
- It's about mooning Willie.

37
00:06:35,845 --> 00:06:37,813
Enter.

38
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:48,720
Come in, boys.

39
00:06:52,895 --> 00:06:54,556
Father Scully...

40
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:58,996
...this is James, Donald,
Bruce and Vernon.

41
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:04,003
Better known as Maps,
Spark, Spit and Misty.

42
00:07:04,373 --> 00:07:06,102
They're our December boys.

43
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:11,138
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you, Father.

44
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:14,544
We have a little surprise for you.

45
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,884
Oh, it's a pleasant surprise.

46
00:07:18,054 --> 00:07:21,080
A benefactor has left
St. Gregory's a little money...

47
00:07:21,257 --> 00:07:25,250
...and I've decided to send everyone
on a holiday.

48
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,993
As this is your birthday month...

49
00:07:28,164 --> 00:07:30,598
...I felt it fitting
you should be the first to go.

50
00:07:30,766 --> 00:07:32,063
We're going on a holiday?

51
00:07:32,235 --> 00:07:35,534
You'll be staying
with Mr. And Mrs. McAnsh.

52
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,366
They're great friends
of the Church.

53
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,769
It's a town called...

54
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:43,206
...Lady Star Cove.

55
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:45,436
It's a special place...

56
00:07:46,782 --> 00:07:49,250
...on the sea.

57
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:54,355
On the sea?

58
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,119
Yes.

59
00:08:00,296 --> 00:08:05,757
It could be
that Our Lady interceded for you.

60
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:11,564
<i>I had this spiritual antenna</i>
<i>other people didn't have.</i>

61
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:16,533
<i>That's why I could see things</i>
<i>no one else could.</i>

62
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,613
<i>When I looked at Our Lady, I knew.</i>

63
00:08:19,815 --> 00:08:24,718
<i>I knew she'd chosen me</i>
<i>for a special mission.</i>

64
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:10,926
Maps.

65
00:09:30,052 --> 00:09:34,512
<i>It was more than being orphans</i>
<i>that tied us together.</i>

66
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,454
<i>Or even our friendship.</i>

67
00:09:38,194 --> 00:09:40,458
<i>It was like destiny.</i>

68
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,255
Cross swords.

69
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,698
<i>We were even given</i>
<i>the same birth month.</i>

70
00:09:45,868 --> 00:09:51,204
All for one, and one for all.
December boys.

71
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:02,575
<i>The further we traveled</i>
<i>from what we knew...</i>

72
00:10:02,785 --> 00:10:07,586
<i>... the more it seemed like we were</i>
<i>being pulled into another world...</i>

73
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,486
<i>... a world where all the doors</i>
<i>were open...</i>

74
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:14,060
<i>... and anything was possible.</i>

75
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,346
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>boys and girls... .

76
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:48,560
<i>The most bone-rattling,</i>
<i>jaw-clenching...</i>

77
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,962
<i>... death-defying act</i>
<i>you've ever seen!</i>

78
00:10:52,134 --> 00:10:57,333
<i>The Wall of Death!</i>

79
00:11:00,876 --> 00:11:05,108
<i>The one, the only,</i>
<i>the bravest man on two wheels...</i>

80
00:11:05,348 --> 00:11:06,975
<i>... Fearless Forte!</i>

81
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,413
- You all right there, boys?
- Yes, Father.

82
00:11:45,588 --> 00:11:48,318
- Come along.
- Come on, fellows.

83
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:51,151
Right you are.
Welcome aboard.

84
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:54,319
Boys, this is Petty Officer
Bandy McAnsh.

85
00:11:54,497 --> 00:11:56,624
Father.

86
00:11:56,832 --> 00:11:59,130
Petty officer.

87
00:12:01,103 --> 00:12:05,005
As you can see,
all present and accounted for.

88
00:12:05,174 --> 00:12:07,699
Boys, I'd like you
to meet my lovely wife...

89
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:11,335
...and the skipper
of this establishment, Mrs. McAnsh.

90
00:12:11,514 --> 00:12:12,606
Nice to meet you.

91
00:12:12,782 --> 00:12:16,718
Father, we thank God
for your safe arrival.

92
00:12:16,952 --> 00:12:19,182
May his grace light your paths...

93
00:12:19,855 --> 00:12:24,883
...and give you the appropriate wisdom
and joy from your new experience.

94
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,051
- Amen.
- I knew there'd be a catch.

95
00:12:27,229 --> 00:12:30,027
Petty officer, show the new recruits
to their quarters...

96
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:32,861
...and I'll finish in the galley.

97
00:12:33,202 --> 00:12:35,500
Well, have fun, boys.

98
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:36,797
Thank you, Father.

99
00:12:36,972 --> 00:12:38,030
Right.

100
00:12:38,207 --> 00:12:40,072
Step this way.

101
00:12:40,242 --> 00:12:42,802
Welcome aboard.

102
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,904
All right, mateys.

103
00:13:11,407 --> 00:13:13,705
It's been a long day.

104
00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:17,242
Time to settle down.
Everyone in bed.

105
00:13:18,914 --> 00:13:24,352
And we'll let the Old Specific
sing you a lullaby.

106
00:13:27,022 --> 00:13:28,683
Good night, boys.

107
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,235
The ocean's loud.

108
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,032
- I didn't think it'd be this loud.
- Yeah.

109
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,802
The Old Specific.

110
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:53,107
Hey, Spit, have a look at this.

111
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,815
Hey, what's that?

112
00:14:03,993 --> 00:14:06,621
I suppose you know
you'll be going to hell?

113
00:14:06,962 --> 00:14:08,930
Really?

114
00:14:10,332 --> 00:14:11,560
Now I'll have company.

115
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,795
Knock it off, both of you.

116
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:19,304
I'm trying to relax.

117
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:23,842
You hear that?

118
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,844
Is he coming?

119
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,446
Listen.

120
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,688
My ass is snoring.

121
00:15:04,186 --> 00:15:06,586
Come on, mate.

122
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:37,117
Last one in's a rotten egg!

123
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:40,049
Really? Looks like
you're the rotten egg, Spit.

124
00:15:40,222 --> 00:15:42,520
Come on, Mist.

125
00:15:45,327 --> 00:15:46,351
Come on, Misty.

126
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,223
- Come on.
- Come in.

127
00:15:53,402 --> 00:15:55,336
Have a look at this.

128
00:15:55,504 --> 00:15:56,732
Spark, come on.

129
00:15:56,905 --> 00:15:59,066
Yeah, coming.

130
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,105
Hey!

131
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:05,507
Hey!

132
00:16:05,681 --> 00:16:07,342
- Hey, fishing boat.
- Hello?

133
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:09,580
- Hey.
- Over here.

134
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:10,878
Hey, over here.

135
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,146
Look.

136
00:16:15,658 --> 00:16:19,458
Come on.
Race you to the rocks.

137
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,347
Hey, fellows.

138
00:17:26,862 --> 00:17:29,729
Somebody's set themselves up.

139
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:37,931
Check out the cordial.

140
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,700
- Maps.
- They're somebody else's.

141
00:17:41,877 --> 00:17:44,004
Don't take any.

142
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,364
Hey.

143
00:18:05,534 --> 00:18:07,195
Who wants a ride?

144
00:18:46,575 --> 00:18:49,066
Coming back down.

145
00:18:55,818 --> 00:18:57,080
Hey, guys.

146
00:18:57,252 --> 00:18:59,277
What is it?

147
00:19:00,088 --> 00:19:01,953
Find out.

148
00:19:37,893 --> 00:19:40,919
<i>She was the most beautiful woman</i>
<i>I'd ever seen...</i>

149
00:19:41,129 --> 00:19:42,960
<i>... other than Our Lady.</i>

150
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:45,861
<i>Sleek as a seal.</i>

151
00:19:46,068 --> 00:19:50,300
<i>Mind you, I hadn't seen</i>
<i>nearly as much of Our Lady.</i>

152
00:19:51,974 --> 00:19:55,603
Sparks. Come on. Sparks, get up.

153
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:58,673
Come on. Get up.

154
00:20:06,488 --> 00:20:09,389
We heard you were coming.

155
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,964
I'm Teresa.

156
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:23,303
<i>This was as close as I'd come</i>
<i>to a religious epiphany.</i>

157
00:20:23,505 --> 00:20:26,599
<i>But whatever ideas I had</i>
<i>about becoming a priest...</i>

158
00:20:26,775 --> 00:20:28,606
<i>... quickly climbed into the back seat.</i>

159
00:20:30,946 --> 00:20:32,880
How did you get these names?

160
00:20:33,048 --> 00:20:36,017
We call him Spark
because he stuck a knife in a toaster...

161
00:20:36,184 --> 00:20:39,210
...and nearly set the orphanage
on fire.

162
00:20:43,058 --> 00:20:45,219
And you? You are Spit?

163
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:53,124
My dad flew a Spitfire during the war.
And I'm a champion spitter.

164
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:56,226
- And you, you like maps.
- No.

165
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:59,133
He's got a birthmark on his chest
shaped like Tasmania.

166
00:20:59,308 --> 00:21:01,572
I'm all right.

167
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:08,479
If he doesn't want any,
I'll have seconds.

168
00:21:15,824 --> 00:21:17,724
And why are you Misty?

169
00:21:17,893 --> 00:21:19,417
Because he's a waterworks.

170
00:21:22,397 --> 00:21:25,696
Okay. I'm going now.

171
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,859
Fearless is home tonight.

172
00:21:41,616 --> 00:21:42,913
Who's that?

173
00:21:43,085 --> 00:21:47,044
That's Shellback.
He fishes for Henry.

174
00:21:47,689 --> 00:21:51,125
Is Henry a person or a fish?

175
00:22:35,837 --> 00:22:38,271
<i>O, my good angel...</i>

176
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:42,474
...whom God has appointed
my guardian...

177
00:22:42,644 --> 00:22:45,238
...watch over me during this night...

178
00:22:45,414 --> 00:22:46,847
...and protect me...

179
00:22:47,582 --> 00:22:50,745
...from evil in my thoughts
as well as my deeds.

180
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,117
In the deepest hour of darkness...

181
00:22:56,324 --> 00:22:59,259
...let your presence lead the way...

182
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,123
<i>... to righteousness...</i>

183
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,696
<i>... and goodness.</i>

184
00:23:14,443 --> 00:23:16,138
Boys.

185
00:23:16,344 --> 00:23:20,075
God cares nothing for motorcycles.

186
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,168
Henry.

187
00:23:45,474 --> 00:23:50,036
- You're gonna get us in trouble.
- I know how to ride one of these.

188
00:23:50,412 --> 00:23:52,471
My dad had one, only bigger.

189
00:23:52,647 --> 00:23:55,013
Bullshit, your dad died
when you was 3.

190
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,480
Get down.

191
00:23:57,819 --> 00:24:00,083
Somebody say
you could climb up there?

192
00:24:00,255 --> 00:24:03,418
We was just looking.

193
00:24:04,126 --> 00:24:06,185
That what you call it?

194
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:08,586
We're here on holiday.

195
00:24:08,763 --> 00:24:11,994
My dad had a bike just like this.

196
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:13,429
That so?

197
00:24:13,635 --> 00:24:16,365
I saw you on the Wall of Death.

198
00:24:16,938 --> 00:24:19,338
I saw you go through the fire
and everything.

199
00:24:19,508 --> 00:24:21,942
You must be about
the best cyclist there is.

200
00:24:27,749 --> 00:24:29,876
- You boys like a thrill, do you?
- Yeah.

201
00:24:31,853 --> 00:24:33,548
Who's first?

202
00:24:36,691 --> 00:24:38,716
I've been on a bike before.

203
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,589
I'll go.

204
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,665
Faster. Faster.

205
00:25:46,828 --> 00:25:47,852
Yes!

206
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:44,514
At least someone's
having a good time.

207
00:27:07,075 --> 00:27:08,099
How you going?

208
00:27:10,745 --> 00:27:12,906
Good night.

209
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,679
See you later.

210
00:27:21,022 --> 00:27:22,080
"How you going?"

211
00:27:22,257 --> 00:27:25,522
You'll be up her
like a rat up a drainpipe.

212
00:27:27,128 --> 00:27:29,358
Come on, give us a go.

213
00:27:29,964 --> 00:27:31,522
Why do we have to be stuck here?

214
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,931
- That's easy.
- No, it's not.

215
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,095
I'm not stuck.

216
00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:49,617
Go.

217
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:51,648
Go.

218
00:27:55,657 --> 00:27:58,217
The least you can do
is three cheers for the corpse.

219
00:27:58,393 --> 00:28:00,224
Hip, hip, hurray!

220
00:28:00,395 --> 00:28:01,885
Boys.

221
00:28:02,063 --> 00:28:03,087
Thanks, Luce.

222
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,754
- Yeah, thanks.
- Thank you, Lucy.

223
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:08,266
That is the same sort of thing
that happened to Archbishop O'Donnell.

224
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,461
I was there in the church
Sunday morning...

225
00:28:10,638 --> 00:28:12,902
...come to the end of the sermon,
and he says:

226
00:28:13,074 --> 00:28:17,272
"Therefore, many are cold
but few are frozen."

227
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:20,073
And it was the middle of winter.

228
00:28:21,082 --> 00:28:23,414
You know, it's good
with Lucy around this summer.

229
00:28:23,585 --> 00:28:28,284
- Give Tess some girl company.
- By the way, how's her father doing?

230
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:31,584
Still looking for work in Darwin.

231
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,090
Five minutes to dinner.

232
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:36,324
- Thanks, darling.
- Cheers, Teresa.

233
00:28:37,031 --> 00:28:40,159
Hey, he just swiped your beer.

234
00:28:41,936 --> 00:28:43,961
Let them have their fun.

235
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,640
Wait for me. Wait.

236
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,038
I don't expect it's a picnic
where they're from.

237
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:52,177
For all you hear,
it's not too bad out there.

238
00:28:52,347 --> 00:28:54,440
They're well cared for.

239
00:28:54,616 --> 00:28:56,846
Yeah, I'll bet they are.

240
00:28:57,051 --> 00:29:00,487
I think I'll go and see
if I can give the girls a hand.

241
00:29:01,055 --> 00:29:04,183
Still, it's not the same
as a family.

242
00:29:04,426 --> 00:29:05,484
Indeed, it isn't.

243
00:29:06,795 --> 00:29:10,322
I think Tess blames me
for taking her away from her family.

244
00:29:10,532 --> 00:29:12,329
Her country.

245
00:29:12,801 --> 00:29:15,634
We're supposed to be
starting our own out here.

246
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,702
You know, maybe it's the accident
that shook something loose.

247
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:24,470
Well, there's no substitute for family,
that's for sure.

248
00:29:24,646 --> 00:29:26,637
You're not saying
you're giving up hope?

249
00:29:26,815 --> 00:29:27,975
No.

250
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,743
I'm not saying that.

251
00:29:30,985 --> 00:29:32,885
It's just...

252
00:29:33,054 --> 00:29:35,147
...you get to a point, you know?

253
00:29:35,323 --> 00:29:38,224
You start to see things
like they are.

254
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:42,323
Sure never pictured
a life without kids.

255
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:48,097
The pity of it is,
there are children...

256
00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:53,263
...just like those boys next door,
desperate for a good home.

257
00:29:53,675 --> 00:29:58,044
And here you are,
desperate for children.

258
00:30:03,251 --> 00:30:05,719
You got a point there, Father.

259
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,547
We want a kid...

260
00:30:08,356 --> 00:30:11,018
...and they need parents.

261
00:30:11,192 --> 00:30:15,094
We could just line them up
and pick which one we like the best.

262
00:30:34,148 --> 00:30:35,547
They get you?

263
00:30:35,717 --> 00:30:37,275
What happened?

264
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:39,885
My glasses got knocked off.

265
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,556
We saved you some.

266
00:30:45,293 --> 00:30:47,659
I'm going to bed.

267
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,264
Come on, Spit.

268
00:31:40,848 --> 00:31:42,782
Dad.

269
00:31:48,523 --> 00:31:49,547
Thank you, Vernon.

270
00:31:51,025 --> 00:31:52,720
More tea?

271
00:31:53,895 --> 00:31:55,328
There you are.

272
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:58,659
I want you all to take notice...

273
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:02,098
...of how sharp young Vernon
looks this morning.

274
00:32:04,973 --> 00:32:07,498
Good on you, son.

275
00:32:16,618 --> 00:32:18,711
You all right?

276
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,585
If it's all right,
I'd like to say grace.

277
00:32:28,997 --> 00:32:30,897
That'd be lovely, Vernon.

278
00:32:31,132 --> 00:32:35,068
O Lord, we beseech thee
in your wondrous grace...

279
00:32:35,236 --> 00:32:39,764
...and thank you for the food
we're about to receive. Amen.

280
00:32:40,008 --> 00:32:42,340
Amen.

281
00:32:45,747 --> 00:32:47,681
Got you.

282
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:49,947
Hey, get back.

283
00:32:50,151 --> 00:32:53,052
No. Don't leave me here. No.

284
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,348
- No fair.
- Yeah.

285
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,251
- I got you already.
- You didn't.

286
00:32:57,425 --> 00:32:59,950
- You're it.
- No.

287
00:33:00,161 --> 00:33:04,427
If you get me,
I'll kiss Sister Beatrice.

288
00:33:05,867 --> 00:33:08,927
Hey, you can't run around
the cross.

289
00:33:33,461 --> 00:33:35,588
Where is my precious Misty?

290
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,458
He's been adopted.

291
00:33:38,566 --> 00:33:41,501
He was always the best of the lot.

292
00:34:17,004 --> 00:34:19,336
You the one living in the cave?

293
00:34:19,507 --> 00:34:22,943
I don't live there.
I just come up here to observe.

294
00:34:26,347 --> 00:34:28,008
You can come up if you want.

295
00:34:35,022 --> 00:34:37,013
You one of them orphan kids?

296
00:34:37,258 --> 00:34:39,123
Yeah.

297
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,959
- What's your name?
- Maps.

298
00:34:43,131 --> 00:34:45,964
So, what are you observing?

299
00:34:46,134 --> 00:34:48,466
You had a good look at these rocks?

300
00:34:48,636 --> 00:34:50,194
I've seen them.

301
00:34:50,371 --> 00:34:52,805
Haven't you noticed
anything strange?

302
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,805
They are weird-looking.

303
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,874
They were left here by aliens.

304
00:35:00,214 --> 00:35:04,310
Same as Stonehenge.
You ever heard of Stonehenge?

305
00:35:04,485 --> 00:35:05,577
Kind of.

306
00:35:05,787 --> 00:35:07,516
Well, it's the same.

307
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:10,885
When they come back,
I'll be ready.

308
00:35:11,058 --> 00:35:12,753
People from outer space?

309
00:35:12,927 --> 00:35:15,157
Of course.

310
00:35:26,007 --> 00:35:28,271
I don't guess you see
many women where you're from.

311
00:35:28,442 --> 00:35:33,038
Nuns, mostly. Nuns.

312
00:35:33,414 --> 00:35:35,905
Yeah, I've seen some of those.

313
00:35:37,451 --> 00:35:40,181
Want some? It's my last one.

314
00:36:16,791 --> 00:36:18,725
By the way...

315
00:36:18,893 --> 00:36:21,123
...my name is Lucy.

316
00:36:21,295 --> 00:36:23,490
Good to meet you.

317
00:36:33,307 --> 00:36:36,333
- Hey, look, what's that?
- Yeah?

318
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,239
Come on, Spit.

319
00:36:38,412 --> 00:36:40,471
- Hey, wait up.
- No.

320
00:36:40,648 --> 00:36:41,672
Dirty trickster.

321
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,020
Look at all this.

322
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,861
Oh, check out the net.

323
00:36:59,033 --> 00:37:03,436
And this is a spear.
What do you reckon he does with this?

324
00:37:08,009 --> 00:37:10,773
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

325
00:37:17,218 --> 00:37:19,550
We was just looking around.

326
00:37:21,422 --> 00:37:24,949
Seeing as you can see so well,
can you read that sign?

327
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:31,025
That's a heavy line you got there.
What are you fishing for, Moby Dick?

328
00:37:31,198 --> 00:37:35,294
When it rains, Spark's the best
fisherman at Bible Creek.

329
00:37:36,637 --> 00:37:38,628
You see a creek around here, boy-o?

330
00:37:38,806 --> 00:37:42,298
He's worried I'll catch Henry
before he does.

331
00:37:44,145 --> 00:37:46,807
What do you know about Henry?

332
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,809
A fish is a fish.

333
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:55,816
Henry's a king of fishes.
He's a masterpiece.

334
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:59,482
He was swimming in these waters
long before you were born.

335
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:03,255
He's bigger and smarter
than you will ever be.

336
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,658
Get lost.

337
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:18,239
Can't I make a suggestion
without getting my bloody head bit off?

338
00:38:18,412 --> 00:38:21,347
It's not a suggestion.
You gave up.

339
00:38:21,515 --> 00:38:24,609
For chrissake, Tess.
Listen to me.

340
00:38:24,785 --> 00:38:27,345
All right? I'm not saying
that we won't have a baby.

341
00:38:27,521 --> 00:38:29,455
All I'm saying
is we should talk about...

342
00:38:29,623 --> 00:38:32,592
...adopting one of those kids
that needs a home.

343
00:38:36,864 --> 00:38:39,526
I talked to someone
at the archdiocese.

344
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,361
It's possible.

345
00:38:41,535 --> 00:38:43,628
That's all I'm saying.

346
00:38:45,773 --> 00:38:49,231
So you've decided.

347
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,105
No.

348
00:38:52,813 --> 00:38:54,872
Tess-- No--

349
00:38:55,049 --> 00:38:56,607
Tess, you're not listening to me.

350
00:38:56,784 --> 00:39:01,084
No. It's your fault
I can't have babies.

351
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:16,166
Whoa, look at that.

352
00:39:16,337 --> 00:39:18,999
- Come on, put some more on.
- You don't need any more.

353
00:39:19,173 --> 00:39:22,142
She's getting naked.

354
00:39:23,044 --> 00:39:26,480
No. Guys, wait.
Wait. Go slow.

355
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:25,168
Quick, run.

356
00:40:31,645 --> 00:40:33,704
I'll yell.

357
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:37,712
Misty, I know there's gotta be
a very good explanation for that...

358
00:40:37,885 --> 00:40:39,876
...so why don't you come out
and tell us what it is?

359
00:40:40,054 --> 00:40:42,420
I promise nothing
will happen to you.

360
00:40:44,925 --> 00:40:46,324
No.

361
00:40:47,328 --> 00:40:49,592
Just remember,
I keep you from getting killed...

362
00:40:49,763 --> 00:40:51,993
...and soon we'll all be back
at St. Greg's.

363
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:54,726
That's what you think.

364
00:42:28,729 --> 00:42:30,424
Boys...

365
00:42:30,598 --> 00:42:32,828
...I have great news.

366
00:42:34,768 --> 00:42:37,794
Father Scully
is taking confession today.

367
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:41,669
Clean slate.
Just in time for Christmas, eh?

368
00:42:41,842 --> 00:42:43,139
- Great.
- Beauty.

369
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:46,973
- Ripper.
- Yeah, great.

370
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,481
Next.

371
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,814
Vernon.

372
00:43:02,029 --> 00:43:03,621
What's troubling you, son?

373
00:43:03,797 --> 00:43:06,357
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

374
00:43:06,533 --> 00:43:08,524
How long is it
since your last confession?

375
00:43:08,702 --> 00:43:11,466
About three weeks.

376
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,164
I've had some unclean thoughts.

377
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,710
And I pulled a face
at one of the sisters.

378
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,642
Is that all?

379
00:43:20,814 --> 00:43:22,748
Not exactly.

380
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:28,482
Oh, come on, lad.
I'm gonna need basting in a minute.

381
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:33,485
Let's say there was something
you wanted.

382
00:43:34,928 --> 00:43:38,386
You know, something you wanted
more than anything.

383
00:43:40,601 --> 00:43:42,660
And you had an advantage...

384
00:43:43,103 --> 00:43:46,004
...because the others don't know.

385
00:43:46,807 --> 00:43:49,742
What is the point in giving it up?

386
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:51,935
I mean... .

387
00:43:52,112 --> 00:43:55,343
Look, I can't guess, son.
You're gonna have to tell me.

388
00:43:56,517 --> 00:44:00,954
It'll ease your mind
if you unburden yourself.

389
00:44:01,121 --> 00:44:03,589
I heard something.

390
00:44:03,957 --> 00:44:06,255
Can you tell what he's saying?

391
00:44:06,927 --> 00:44:09,327
Something about...

392
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:12,030
...big breasts.

393
00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:14,133
What?

394
00:44:14,301 --> 00:44:19,261
If you keep this knowledge to yourself,
are you being fair with the other boys?

395
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,774
I think you should tell them.

396
00:44:22,943 --> 00:44:27,471
The burdens and the joys of this world
are always better shared.

397
00:44:27,648 --> 00:44:29,138
Do you understand me?

398
00:44:29,717 --> 00:44:31,275
I've got to share.

399
00:44:31,452 --> 00:44:32,714
That's right.

400
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,950
Now, for your penance,
you say five Hail Marys--

401
00:44:36,123 --> 00:44:37,784
Something else happened last night.

402
00:44:38,459 --> 00:44:41,428
Save it till next time. I'm cooked.

403
00:44:45,466 --> 00:44:48,094
Oh, Hail Mary.
Oh, Hail Mary.

404
00:45:02,983 --> 00:45:04,917
It's time to come clean.

405
00:45:05,085 --> 00:45:06,916
Get off me.
My arm can't breathe.

406
00:45:07,087 --> 00:45:09,681
Tell us or we'll slag you.

407
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,619
Now then,
I wouldn't want anything...

408
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:17,594
...coming out of Spit's mouth
landing on my face.

409
00:45:23,103 --> 00:45:24,127
I'll tell you.

410
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:30,135
Fearless and Teresa
are gonna adopt one of us.

411
00:45:31,044 --> 00:45:32,671
I swear.

412
00:45:33,781 --> 00:45:35,772
Let him up.

413
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,280
- I swear.
- When?

414
00:45:41,455 --> 00:45:43,320
I don't know.

415
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:47,358
Before we leave. They're gonna choose
which one of us they like best.

416
00:45:47,528 --> 00:45:49,462
Why would they want us?
We're too old.

417
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:51,188
Speak for yourself.

418
00:45:51,365 --> 00:45:53,833
We're not as old as you are.

419
00:45:59,573 --> 00:46:02,133
Did they say who they want?

420
00:46:05,479 --> 00:46:07,379
You don't know which it is.

421
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:18,681
- Where are the others?
- I'm not sure.

422
00:46:46,854 --> 00:46:49,482
My real name's Vernon.

423
00:46:51,625 --> 00:46:55,493
You know,
Africa is just over there.

424
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,632
Vernon, do you remember
your parents?

425
00:47:10,644 --> 00:47:13,078
I think I do...

426
00:47:13,614 --> 00:47:16,913
...but maybe it was a photo.

427
00:47:18,151 --> 00:47:22,315
My dad was tall and tan.

428
00:47:22,523 --> 00:47:26,653
And my mother
had long, dark hair.

429
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:29,551
She was smiling.

430
00:47:31,164 --> 00:47:34,065
They died in a car accident.

431
00:47:34,735 --> 00:47:39,536
I don't know why I wasn't there.
Nobody ever told me.

432
00:47:41,408 --> 00:47:46,573
If my parents were still alive,
I'd never let them out of my sight.

433
00:47:51,318 --> 00:47:53,445
What's he doing?

434
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,417
That's Socrates.

435
00:47:55,589 --> 00:47:59,958
Shellback says he catches fish
and feeds them to the cats.

436
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,752
Have you seen him do it?

437
00:48:01,929 --> 00:48:06,992
No, but I believe
a lot of things I can't see.

438
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,960
Me too.

439
00:48:28,355 --> 00:48:31,085
You ever think about
running away?

440
00:48:31,792 --> 00:48:33,555
There's no place to run.

441
00:48:33,727 --> 00:48:37,163
When I get 18,
they make you leave anyway.

442
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:45,695
Like music?

443
00:48:54,715 --> 00:48:57,411
So, what do you do
for fun out there?

444
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:05,019
When it floods,
we can swim or go fishing.

445
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:09,060
We have a footy team and a choir.

446
00:49:10,163 --> 00:49:11,755
Can you sing?

447
00:49:12,165 --> 00:49:14,030
Not really.

448
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,930
Try singing this.

449
00:49:16,103 --> 00:49:18,571
I'm no good.

450
00:49:22,142 --> 00:49:24,906
Give it a go
and I'll give you a prize.

451
00:49:45,866 --> 00:49:47,163
Listen.

452
00:50:11,124 --> 00:50:12,421
What'd you think?

453
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:13,957
That was good.

454
00:50:20,133 --> 00:50:22,499
That was your first kiss, I bet.

455
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:32,468
I can teach you if you want.

456
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:48,185
Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying
I'm a better rider than Fearless.

457
00:50:48,361 --> 00:50:51,956
All I'm saying is that
what he does ain't as hard as it looks.

458
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:56,796
You're full of it.
You've never ridden a bike in your life.

459
00:50:57,804 --> 00:51:00,864
It's all right to be jealous, Misty,
my little mate.

460
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:04,807
Me and Fearless have something
in common that you'll never have.

461
00:51:07,447 --> 00:51:10,507
Hey, what was that for?

462
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:13,149
Get back here.

463
00:51:14,287 --> 00:51:17,381
Get you later, you little mongrel.

464
00:51:54,327 --> 00:51:56,261
We've come to tell you, Vernon...

465
00:51:56,429 --> 00:51:58,021
...you're to be adopted.

466
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:01,565
You can stay here
as long as you like.

467
00:52:01,735 --> 00:52:06,570
And now for some
excellent cartwheels.

468
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:29,559
He's not good for much, but at least
my uncle can make decent grog.

469
00:52:36,102 --> 00:52:38,434
Who do you think they'll choose?

470
00:52:38,939 --> 00:52:40,930
I don't know.

471
00:52:41,441 --> 00:52:44,774
Spit's clever.
He can fix most anything.

472
00:52:45,445 --> 00:52:48,471
Misty's the youngest,
and he's a good artist.

473
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:53,477
And Spark's got good energy.
He's the fastest, wins all the races.

474
00:52:53,653 --> 00:52:57,589
What about you? Aren't you good
at anything? I know it's not singing.

475
00:52:57,757 --> 00:53:00,225
Well, I don't wanna be adopted.

476
00:53:00,393 --> 00:53:03,487
What's the big deal
about parents anyway?

477
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:22,935
Where have you been?

478
00:54:24,244 --> 00:54:26,906
I think Skipper's dead.

479
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,344
What do you mean dead?

480
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,882
Well, lads...

481
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:36,587
...the skipper's...

482
00:54:38,058 --> 00:54:40,993
...a bit under the weather tonight...

483
00:54:41,161 --> 00:54:44,927
...so I suppose it'll be
bread and jam for tea.

484
00:54:45,098 --> 00:54:51,264
Anyway, as the next
highest-ranking officer...

485
00:54:51,471 --> 00:54:55,498
...she has asked me to carry on.

486
00:54:55,675 --> 00:54:59,771
I think it's appropriate...

487
00:55:00,613 --> 00:55:03,047
...and not out of place...

488
00:55:04,918 --> 00:55:09,480
...to give you your Christmas gifts
tonight.

489
00:55:09,856 --> 00:55:11,949
- Any objections?
- No.

490
00:55:12,625 --> 00:55:14,991
Right, good show.

491
00:55:16,496 --> 00:55:19,397
- Merry Christmas.
- Thanks, Bandy.

492
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:22,262
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Bandy.

493
00:55:22,435 --> 00:55:24,869
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

494
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:29,566
- And merry Christmas.
- Thanks, Bandy. Merry Christmas.

495
00:55:36,383 --> 00:55:37,407
What is it?

496
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:41,253
Well, I don't suppose
you've seen one of these...

497
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,548
...but every ship has one.

498
00:55:43,723 --> 00:55:45,884
It's called a gyroscope.

499
00:55:51,297 --> 00:55:54,095
Keeps your vessel balanced.

500
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:08,672
It's like the ship's conscience.

501
00:56:22,362 --> 00:56:25,593
I'll leave the bread and jam
on the sideboard.

502
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:28,760
Thanks.

503
00:56:30,203 --> 00:56:34,299
If Misty's right,
they'll send us packing.

504
00:56:35,008 --> 00:56:38,500
- Misty's always making stuff up.
- We've gotta go and have a closer look.

505
00:56:39,112 --> 00:56:42,275
- I'm not going in their bedroom.
- Me neither.

506
00:56:42,449 --> 00:56:44,849
Then Misty and me will go.

507
00:56:45,018 --> 00:56:47,782
When Bandy goes out, we'll go in.

508
00:56:57,297 --> 00:57:01,461
Remember, we don't know anything.
So just...

509
00:57:01,634 --> 00:57:03,864
...look cheerful.

510
00:57:05,405 --> 00:57:06,497
What happened to Misty?

511
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:09,471
He's shining his glasses.

512
00:57:14,714 --> 00:57:17,808
Hey. Merry Christmas, boys.

513
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:28,820
- Where's Misty?
- He's coming.

514
00:57:28,995 --> 00:57:31,395
- He's always late.
- He can't be trusted.

515
00:57:35,768 --> 00:57:37,565
Here he is.

516
00:57:37,737 --> 00:57:41,195
- What do you got there, mate?
- I made you two a present.

517
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:42,841
Thanks, buddy.

518
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:47,103
All right.

519
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:53,076
Now that you're all here,
me and Tess have got a surprise for you.

520
00:57:56,122 --> 00:58:00,923
Now, we weren't real sure about the
sizes, but they all got drawstrings. So... .

521
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:04,556
- Misty.
- Merry Christmas.

522
00:58:04,931 --> 00:58:06,262
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

523
00:58:06,432 --> 00:58:07,763
- Merry Christmas.
- Spark.

524
00:58:10,203 --> 00:58:12,262
Merry Christmas, boys.

525
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:17,876
Well, go on, open them up.
Open them up.

526
00:58:23,983 --> 00:58:26,144
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

527
00:58:27,453 --> 00:58:29,250
Where's Bandy and Skipper?

528
00:58:31,558 --> 00:58:36,154
Well, Mrs. McAnsh is a bit sick,
but Bandy will be by later.

529
00:58:36,329 --> 00:58:37,387
Okay.

530
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:42,792
- All right, that's French for "let's eat."
- Sit where you like.

531
00:59:22,742 --> 00:59:24,801
Skipper?

532
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:27,139
Skipper?

533
00:59:35,455 --> 00:59:36,479
Skipper?

534
01:00:05,013 --> 01:00:08,176
She wasn't such a bad old stick.

535
01:00:09,885 --> 01:00:12,376
She looks like a car without a driver.

536
01:00:20,228 --> 01:00:24,790
I saw Bandy giving her pills,
but I never knew how bad she was.

537
01:00:27,169 --> 01:00:30,036
I hope she didn't suffer.

538
01:00:32,007 --> 01:00:36,501
Well, she's probably up there,
in heaven...

539
01:00:36,678 --> 01:00:39,704
...looking down on us, thinking:

540
01:00:39,881 --> 01:00:43,044
"What's those silly buggers doing?"

541
01:00:46,021 --> 01:00:49,013
Go on. Touch her.

542
01:00:49,191 --> 01:00:52,683
- I'm not touching her.
- I will if you go first.

543
01:00:52,861 --> 01:00:54,089
Don't be a nancy.

544
01:01:08,777 --> 01:01:11,143
Pray with me.

545
01:01:13,548 --> 01:01:16,381
I'll look after her, doctor.

546
01:01:16,551 --> 01:01:18,109
I'll be back tomorrow evening.

547
01:01:22,791 --> 01:01:24,759
Father.

548
01:01:34,136 --> 01:01:35,797
Father...

549
01:01:35,971 --> 01:01:38,735
...tell the boys to come in.

550
01:01:51,953 --> 01:01:54,285
Sorry. We just wanted to--

551
01:01:54,456 --> 01:01:57,118
Wanted to know
what was happening. I know.

552
01:01:59,995 --> 01:02:01,519
Come closer.

553
01:02:08,336 --> 01:02:12,636
I'm sorry you have to see me like this.
I must look a fright.

554
01:02:13,642 --> 01:02:17,169
It was selfish of me
to invite you here...

555
01:02:17,345 --> 01:02:21,281
...but I thought it'd be nice to have
some young energy in the Cove.

556
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:23,941
And I was right.

557
01:02:24,953 --> 01:02:26,511
It's just...

558
01:02:26,688 --> 01:02:29,953
...my disease won't cooperate.

559
01:02:32,194 --> 01:02:34,628
What's wrong with you?

560
01:02:34,963 --> 01:02:37,557
I got cancer.

561
01:02:40,535 --> 01:02:42,662
Will we have to go back now?

562
01:02:45,941 --> 01:02:48,205
I was hoping you'd stay.

563
01:02:50,312 --> 01:02:52,974
Bandy's taking it hard...

564
01:02:53,715 --> 01:02:58,379
...and I know you boys
can help lift his spirit.

565
01:03:42,597 --> 01:03:45,031
Well, it's the calling.

566
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,465
They say no matter how hard
you don't want to do it...

567
01:03:48,637 --> 01:03:53,074
...if God wants you, he'll get you.

568
01:03:53,542 --> 01:03:56,773
But what if you just didn't do it?

569
01:03:56,945 --> 01:04:00,403
- I mean, you could refuse.
- That's what I'm saying.

570
01:04:00,582 --> 01:04:03,050
You can't not do it.

571
01:04:03,618 --> 01:04:06,883
I had a teacher once
who told me she was called.

572
01:04:07,055 --> 01:04:09,285
She tried to fight it.

573
01:04:09,457 --> 01:04:11,118
She traveled through Europe...

574
01:04:11,293 --> 01:04:14,785
...drinking, having sex
like nobody's business.

575
01:04:14,963 --> 01:04:19,332
But she knew she couldn't be happy
until she was a nun.

576
01:04:21,636 --> 01:04:23,797
Do you think you'll get called?

577
01:04:23,972 --> 01:04:26,463
I sure hope not.

578
01:04:27,275 --> 01:04:29,573
But it's like you're metal...

579
01:04:29,744 --> 01:04:35,341
...and God's the biggest,
most powerful magnet ever made.

580
01:04:40,121 --> 01:04:42,112
So do you think you'll be a priest?

581
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:44,588
Hell, no.

582
01:04:46,261 --> 01:04:50,459
I go to a Catholic school,
but it's not like they turn you into one.

583
01:04:50,632 --> 01:04:53,294
They teach you other stuff.

584
01:04:54,469 --> 01:04:56,699
Father Maps.

585
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:01,776
I've been a very bad girl.

586
01:05:04,179 --> 01:05:08,172
Why have you been a bad girl,
Sister Lucy?

587
01:05:10,452 --> 01:05:15,617
Well, Father,
I've been thinking about a boy.

588
01:05:18,026 --> 01:05:19,960
You have?

589
01:05:22,464 --> 01:05:24,625
I like him.

590
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:32,901
I let him touch me.

591
01:05:40,148 --> 01:05:42,173
Everywhere.

592
01:06:02,237 --> 01:06:05,434
Kiss me on the neck. I like that.

593
01:06:11,446 --> 01:06:12,936
Come closer.

594
01:06:15,383 --> 01:06:17,578
Pull down your pants.

595
01:06:49,918 --> 01:06:52,216
Hey! Hey!

596
01:06:52,387 --> 01:06:54,548
Get out of my boat!

597
01:06:54,723 --> 01:06:58,989
Nobody gave you permission!
Get out!

598
01:07:54,249 --> 01:07:57,343
Serves you right.

599
01:08:46,935 --> 01:08:50,803
I want you to always remember me
as your first.

600
01:08:51,372 --> 01:08:53,704
No worries.

601
01:09:03,852 --> 01:09:05,717
Where?

602
01:09:05,887 --> 01:09:07,184
Where?

603
01:09:07,355 --> 01:09:08,947
I can't see anything.

604
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:14,420
I told you. You're seeing things.

605
01:09:18,733 --> 01:09:22,533
Hey, Maps,
you can see her public hair.

606
01:09:30,378 --> 01:09:32,437
What's on your neck?

607
01:09:37,719 --> 01:09:39,983
What did you do?

608
01:09:41,289 --> 01:09:45,089
Maybe you'll figure it out
when you're older.

609
01:10:10,818 --> 01:10:13,981
Let me go. Come on, get off.

610
01:10:30,638 --> 01:10:31,935
Henry.

611
01:10:35,677 --> 01:10:39,613
I caught Henry!
He's mine! Yes! Yes!

612
01:10:40,048 --> 01:10:43,506
Yes, I caught him!
I told you I would and I did!

613
01:10:43,685 --> 01:10:46,882
Yes! I'm the best fisherman
in the Cove! Yes!

614
01:10:47,488 --> 01:10:50,787
Oh, yes!
You saw me, I caught him!

615
01:10:51,326 --> 01:10:52,987
Yes!

616
01:10:53,461 --> 01:10:54,621
Told you I'd catch him!

617
01:11:19,654 --> 01:11:22,088
You could have him if you want.

618
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:25,889
You could stuff him
and put him up in your hut.

619
01:11:36,004 --> 01:11:37,904
Get a spade...

620
01:11:38,072 --> 01:11:41,599
...and give him a proper burial.

621
01:12:56,551 --> 01:12:58,178
Mr. Watson?

622
01:12:58,352 --> 01:13:00,946
What's the picture like?

623
01:13:01,122 --> 01:13:04,285
I'm up top.
Can you make out anything?

624
01:13:04,459 --> 01:13:07,826
Should be something Christmassy.

625
01:13:08,763 --> 01:13:11,664
Is Lucy here?

626
01:13:14,068 --> 01:13:16,935
Lucy? No.
She's gone up to Darwin to her dad.

627
01:13:20,208 --> 01:13:22,176
When is she getting back?

628
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:25,672
Maybe next summer.

629
01:13:53,007 --> 01:13:56,170
I'll give you some to take for Bandy.

630
01:13:57,879 --> 01:14:00,074
I don't mean to be rude...

631
01:14:00,248 --> 01:14:03,740
...but this is the best meal I've had
since I got here.

632
01:14:06,154 --> 01:14:09,123
It's the best meal I've ever had.

633
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:15,251
This is the best meal...

634
01:14:15,429 --> 01:14:16,691
...l'll ever have.

635
01:14:31,078 --> 01:14:33,546
Aren't you hungry, Maps?

636
01:14:37,251 --> 01:14:41,085
You know, I've never been
to the outback. What's it like?

637
01:14:41,656 --> 01:14:43,954
You can't fish unless it floods.

638
01:14:44,158 --> 01:14:45,182
It's boring.

639
01:14:46,594 --> 01:14:48,357
It's a hundred times better here.

640
01:14:51,365 --> 01:14:54,027
How about you, Maps?

641
01:14:54,202 --> 01:14:56,397
Are you homesick?

642
01:14:56,904 --> 01:14:58,735
I like the outback all right.

643
01:14:59,974 --> 01:15:01,908
You can count on things out there.

644
01:15:05,279 --> 01:15:07,941
I guess it's what you're used to.

645
01:15:11,986 --> 01:15:13,647
You well and truly
screwed yourself.

646
01:15:13,821 --> 01:15:16,051
You might as well have said
you didn't want to be adopted.

647
01:15:16,224 --> 01:15:19,625
You think getting adopted
is gonna fix anything?

648
01:15:19,794 --> 01:15:23,924
You don't get it. Everyone leaves.

649
01:15:28,769 --> 01:15:33,797
<i>Up to this time, Maps thought</i>
<i>we were all in the same boat.</i>

650
01:15:35,443 --> 01:15:40,142
<i>Now he realized he was hanging</i>
<i>off the side on his own.</i>

651
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:50,855
<i>I never fully understood why Maps</i>
<i>reached out to Fearless that night...</i>

652
01:15:51,025 --> 01:15:53,858
<i>... and I never asked.</i>

653
01:16:09,510 --> 01:16:11,000
- Tickets for the Wall of Death.

654
01:16:11,178 --> 01:16:13,646
Get your tickets
for the Wall of Death.

655
01:16:18,986 --> 01:16:22,012
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls...

656
01:16:22,189 --> 01:16:24,123
...the most bone-rattling...

657
01:16:24,292 --> 01:16:26,487
...jaw-clenching...

658
01:16:26,661 --> 01:16:28,060
...nail-biting...

659
01:16:28,229 --> 01:16:33,189
...death-defying act
you've ever seen.

660
01:16:33,367 --> 01:16:38,805
The one, the only,
the bravest man on two wheels...

661
01:16:38,973 --> 01:16:40,804
...Fearless Forte!

662
01:16:53,888 --> 01:16:56,083
Get your tickets
for the Wall of Death.

663
01:16:56,290 --> 01:17:00,556
The bravest man on two wheels... .

664
01:17:01,696 --> 01:17:04,392
Son, he's just over there.

665
01:17:37,264 --> 01:17:41,200
Go on. Get a move on.
It's not smoko yet.

666
01:17:54,081 --> 01:17:55,241
What are you doing here?

667
01:17:57,184 --> 01:17:58,412
Maps. Hey--

668
01:17:59,253 --> 01:18:01,153
You're shit.

669
01:18:01,322 --> 01:18:02,653
- Maps--
- You lied.

670
01:18:02,857 --> 01:18:04,950
You're a liar like all the rest.

671
01:18:05,126 --> 01:18:07,993
You made out you're some
kind of a hero, but you're nothing.

672
01:18:08,162 --> 01:18:09,652
You're worse than nothing.

673
01:18:09,964 --> 01:18:11,454
It's a job, man.

674
01:18:12,166 --> 01:18:16,967
Stop lying. Like you could ever
adopt one of us.

675
01:18:17,138 --> 01:18:20,574
Like you've got the right
to be our father.

676
01:18:20,741 --> 01:18:23,232
You're a nobody.
We don't need you.

677
01:18:23,411 --> 01:18:25,072
- Maps--
- We don't need anyone.

678
01:18:27,948 --> 01:18:29,438
Maps.

679
01:18:29,617 --> 01:18:30,914
Do you want a lift home?

680
01:18:31,085 --> 01:18:33,019
Clive!

681
01:18:34,021 --> 01:18:37,115
Get your ass back here now.

682
01:18:58,446 --> 01:19:00,937
Where have you been?

683
01:19:03,017 --> 01:19:05,645
- Where's the others?
- Looking for you.

684
01:19:07,321 --> 01:19:09,312
We've been worried about you.

685
01:19:10,057 --> 01:19:12,457
You must let us know
where you are, son.

686
01:19:16,197 --> 01:19:17,323
Son?

687
01:19:58,339 --> 01:19:59,704
What are you doing?

688
01:20:04,512 --> 01:20:06,036
Get your things. Now.

689
01:20:06,213 --> 01:20:09,239
We're leaving. Come on!

690
01:20:09,917 --> 01:20:11,612
- Get your stuff.
- Where are we going?

691
01:20:11,785 --> 01:20:14,583
Home. It's all been a lie.

692
01:20:18,225 --> 01:20:21,752
- Just shut up and get your stuff!
- Stop!

693
01:20:27,501 --> 01:20:29,025
Misty, get off!

694
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:42,644
I'm trying to look after you!

695
01:21:14,715 --> 01:21:15,807
Nice spot you got here.

696
01:21:23,424 --> 01:21:24,686
Shit.

697
01:21:25,192 --> 01:21:27,683
The little bloke do that?

698
01:21:28,762 --> 01:21:31,458
You guys fight worse than brothers.

699
01:21:31,966 --> 01:21:33,957
We are brothers.

700
01:21:35,002 --> 01:21:38,836
Leave me alone. I'll be all right.

701
01:21:39,306 --> 01:21:41,706
Yeah, I don't doubt that.

702
01:21:42,176 --> 01:21:43,438
What about the others?

703
01:21:44,378 --> 01:21:47,211
You just gonna abandon them
because you're mad at Lucy?

704
01:21:47,381 --> 01:21:49,815
You don't know anything about it.

705
01:21:54,021 --> 01:21:56,956
Well, at least there's something
that I do know.

706
01:21:58,025 --> 01:22:00,960
You're wrong what you said to me.

707
01:22:02,029 --> 01:22:04,725
Teresa and me
would make good parents.

708
01:22:04,898 --> 01:22:08,527
And we would've had a load of kids
around now if it weren't for me.

709
01:22:08,969 --> 01:22:12,063
I crashed the bike
with Tess on the back.

710
01:22:13,507 --> 01:22:16,533
We used to be a team in the shows.

711
01:22:18,979 --> 01:22:22,039
She spent half a year in hospital.

712
01:22:24,318 --> 01:22:27,481
And I tried to keep it going
on my own, but... .

713
01:22:32,826 --> 01:22:34,350
Does Teresa know?

714
01:22:36,363 --> 01:22:38,729
Tess always knows.

715
01:23:48,202 --> 01:23:49,328
Help!

716
01:23:54,775 --> 01:23:57,073
Help me!

717
01:23:57,711 --> 01:23:59,770
Maps!

718
01:24:00,714 --> 01:24:01,806
Maps!

719
01:24:03,717 --> 01:24:09,485
Help! Help! Anyone, help!

720
01:24:14,661 --> 01:24:18,620
Maps! Help, it's Misty!

721
01:24:20,134 --> 01:24:22,864
Hang on, Misty!

722
01:24:23,670 --> 01:24:25,501
- What happened?
- The rip got him.

723
01:24:25,672 --> 01:24:29,039
- He fell off the rocks.
- Get help.

724
01:24:31,879 --> 01:24:34,507
You can't swim!

725
01:25:04,511 --> 01:25:06,706
Look at us. We're swimming.

726
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:09,348
I'm drowning.

727
01:25:10,384 --> 01:25:12,147
Hang onto me, catch your breath.

728
01:26:39,673 --> 01:26:41,300
Shellback!

729
01:26:56,023 --> 01:26:58,924
Really, we tried to save you.
We did.

730
01:26:59,092 --> 01:27:01,117
I was trying to save you, I swear.

731
01:27:01,295 --> 01:27:03,286
I came into the water.
It was up to my neck.

732
01:27:03,463 --> 01:27:06,296
I went to the McAnsh's, and--
But then I went to Shellback.

733
01:27:06,466 --> 01:27:08,024
How you feeling, boys?

734
01:27:08,201 --> 01:27:10,431
I'm better than I was.

735
01:27:11,038 --> 01:27:12,335
I gotta say, mate...

736
01:27:12,506 --> 01:27:16,135
...you're braver than me, going out
there not knowing how to swim.

737
01:27:16,877 --> 01:27:18,674
Well done.

738
01:27:18,845 --> 01:27:20,836
I was just a couple of feet
away from you.

739
01:27:21,014 --> 01:27:22,538
You were 75 yards out
or something.

740
01:27:22,716 --> 01:27:25,446
- I could almost grab--
- Who wants some soup? Hey?

741
01:27:26,053 --> 01:27:28,021
Yeah, okay.

742
01:27:29,189 --> 01:27:33,057
I might have saved you. But l--
Something just pulled me away.

743
01:27:33,627 --> 01:27:35,788
Something just pulled me.

744
01:27:35,963 --> 01:27:37,521
Come on.

745
01:27:37,698 --> 01:27:40,132
So, what do we got?

746
01:27:43,870 --> 01:27:45,303
Did you see her?

747
01:27:58,585 --> 01:28:00,712
Thanks.

748
01:28:24,344 --> 01:28:26,676
I suppose you're the one.

749
01:28:26,847 --> 01:28:28,109
You showed us all up.

750
01:28:28,281 --> 01:28:32,081
Yeah. For an old bloke,
you came through.

751
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:35,854
I don't want to be adopted.

752
01:28:37,591 --> 01:28:39,559
You don't?

753
01:28:41,128 --> 01:28:43,062
No.

754
01:28:44,498 --> 01:28:48,366
I like... . Well, I like things
the way they are.

755
01:29:03,116 --> 01:29:04,811
My money's on you, Misty.

756
01:29:49,429 --> 01:29:54,128
<i>We were running out of time and hope,</i>
<i>and there was still no answer.</i>

757
01:29:54,301 --> 01:29:57,532
<i>No one seemed to notice</i>
<i>that the biggest moment of my life...</i>

758
01:29:57,704 --> 01:29:59,968
<i>... was about to get left behind.</i>

759
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:02,608
I'm tired of waiting.

760
01:30:09,082 --> 01:30:11,710
Come through. Come through.

761
01:30:13,687 --> 01:30:16,986
So guess you're all packed up.

762
01:30:18,024 --> 01:30:21,016
Sit down. Sit down.

763
01:30:23,497 --> 01:30:26,159
I wanna know
if you're gonna adopt me.

764
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:29,569
I heard you tell Father Scully
you were gonna adopt one of us.

765
01:30:31,638 --> 01:30:34,163
If you're gonna adopt anyone,
it ought to be Misty.

766
01:30:34,474 --> 01:30:37,238
- Not so fast. I've got qualities.
- I can run fast.

767
01:30:37,410 --> 01:30:39,901
- You can't even stay conscious.
- Hey, boys. Boys.

768
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:44,374
We've made up our minds.

769
01:30:52,092 --> 01:30:54,526
We wish we could adopt all of you.

770
01:30:58,165 --> 01:31:00,224
You're all such wonderful boys.

771
01:31:01,835 --> 01:31:03,268
We've put in the paperwork...

772
01:31:05,372 --> 01:31:08,170
...and it's just gonna take
a little time.

773
01:31:20,387 --> 01:31:22,685
Misty...

774
01:31:23,156 --> 01:31:26,182
...we want you to be our son.

775
01:31:30,063 --> 01:31:33,362
And we hope
you want us for your parents.

776
01:31:33,533 --> 01:31:35,797
We're not perfect, mate...

777
01:31:36,436 --> 01:31:38,927
...but we could love you.

778
01:31:43,043 --> 01:31:44,374
Good on you, mate.

779
01:31:56,489 --> 01:31:57,979
Yeah.

780
01:31:58,191 --> 01:32:01,058
Misty's the one, for sure.

781
01:32:16,710 --> 01:32:20,168
Well, hey, it's not like
we're never gonna see you again.

782
01:32:20,347 --> 01:32:22,440
I mean, we're sure
to come back and visit...

783
01:32:22,616 --> 01:32:27,144
...and if you're ever in the mood for
some boiled lamb, you can come visit us.

784
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:30,153
You boys are gonna come back
and say goodbye before you go?

785
01:32:30,323 --> 01:32:32,416
Oh, no worries.

786
01:32:41,434 --> 01:32:43,629
We'll see him again.

787
01:32:44,137 --> 01:32:45,968
See you, fellas.

788
01:32:48,742 --> 01:32:52,303
Just remember, Misty, no matter what,
you're still a December boy.

789
01:32:52,479 --> 01:32:54,538
Yeah.

790
01:32:55,682 --> 01:32:58,150
- Hey.
- Got you.

791
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:01,312
You're gonna have to run
faster than that.

792
01:33:01,788 --> 01:33:03,653
Hey.

793
01:33:05,292 --> 01:33:07,556
Come get me.

794
01:33:12,365 --> 01:33:13,832
Let's go get some souvenirs.

795
01:33:14,367 --> 01:33:17,336
Get a crab for Sister Edna.

796
01:33:18,505 --> 01:33:20,530
Look at this.

797
01:33:20,707 --> 01:33:23,904
Spit. Quick, before it gets away.

798
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:43,192
I don't want you
to be mad at me...

799
01:33:43,897 --> 01:33:46,161
...but I can't stay.

800
01:33:46,333 --> 01:33:48,858
If I was ever gonna be adopted...

801
01:33:49,035 --> 01:33:53,495
...you'd be the best parents
I could have, and that's no lie.

802
01:33:56,543 --> 01:33:59,341
But I've already got a family.

803
01:34:09,122 --> 01:34:10,885
They'd be lost without me.

804
01:34:11,057 --> 01:34:13,184
I know.

805
01:34:14,561 --> 01:34:16,893
No hard feelings?

806
01:34:17,063 --> 01:34:19,827
No hard feelings, Misty.

807
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:31,310
Go on.

808
01:34:31,478 --> 01:34:33,537
Thank you.

809
01:34:33,713 --> 01:34:35,044
Look what I found over here.

810
01:34:35,215 --> 01:34:37,877
- Give it back, that's mine.
- No, I found it.

811
01:34:38,051 --> 01:34:40,747
Hey, come on.

812
01:34:47,427 --> 01:34:50,260
Well, lads, this is it.

813
01:34:50,430 --> 01:34:51,920
I thought...

814
01:34:52,098 --> 01:34:56,660
...if you wanted a keepsake,
you might like to take the signal flags.

815
01:34:56,870 --> 01:34:58,770
Thanks.

816
01:35:03,243 --> 01:35:06,508
The boys would like
to say goodbye, Skipper.

817
01:35:13,887 --> 01:35:15,980
Thanks, Skipper.

818
01:35:18,491 --> 01:35:20,322
Thanks.

819
01:35:21,661 --> 01:35:23,458
Hey.

820
01:35:23,630 --> 01:35:25,996
Thanks, Skipper.

821
01:35:28,668 --> 01:35:30,761
Goodbye.

822
01:35:35,608 --> 01:35:38,509
Okay, orphans, disembark.

823
01:35:38,678 --> 01:35:43,115
Left, right, left, right, left, right... .

824
01:35:57,497 --> 01:35:58,521
See you, Bandy.

825
01:35:58,698 --> 01:36:00,029
See you, Father.

826
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:02,361
- See you, boys.
- Thank you, Bandy.

827
01:36:03,470 --> 01:36:04,801
- See you, Bandy.
- Bye.

828
01:36:04,971 --> 01:36:07,235
Thanks, Bandy.

829
01:36:08,174 --> 01:36:09,971
- Bye.
- Hey, look.

830

<i>If it weren't for Maps, who knows</i>
<i>if any of us would have ever come back.</i>

831
01:36:49,382 --> 01:36:51,509
<i>We could have gone on</i>
<i>thinking of the Cove...</i>

832
01:36:51,684 --> 01:36:54,050

836

837

839

<i>I got his letter just a few days</i>

840
01:37:45,405 --> 01:37:49,466
