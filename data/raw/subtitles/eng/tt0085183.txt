1
00:01:47,213 --> 00:01:49,005
And lo the
Kingdom of the Spider

2
00:01:49,213 --> 00:01:51,505
shall lust 1,000 years.

3
00:01:51,505 --> 00:01:55,338
And the people shall
suffer 1,000 years,

4
00:01:55,547 --> 00:01:57,005
for it is written.

5
00:01:57,213 --> 00:02:01,088
And this time shall be known
us the Age of Darkness,

6
00:02:01,297 --> 00:02:04,213
for the shadow of the
Spider shall be the law.

7
00:02:04,422 --> 00:02:07,047
Indeed, the people
shall pay iribute

8
00:02:07,255 --> 00:02:10,755
to the word of the muster,
and live in bondage

9
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:12,880
in ihe valley of ihe shadows,

10
00:02:13,088 --> 00:02:15,255
even to the very mists
of the volcano

11
00:02:15,463 --> 00:02:17,338
that sleeps above.

12
00:02:17,547 --> 00:02:21,505
Tclke heed, when the
thousand years is done,

13
00:02:21,505 --> 00:02:25,588
a mun will come to
promise a different way.

14
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:27,922
And he shall be named Toron.

15
00:02:28,838 --> 00:02:32,505
Mcmy will believe, and
many will be persecuted.

16
00:02:32,505 --> 00:02:36,130
The sign of Toron will
bear witness to ihe legend,

17
00:02:36,338 --> 00:02:39,755
but Toron will fail,
for the wrath

18
00:02:39,963 --> 00:02:43,172
of the Spider King is
mighty indeed.

19
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,672
And the people of the
valley shall weep,

20
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,172
for there is no hope,
for it is also written

21
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,588
that the Spider King
will reign until

22
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:56,797
the day the mountain
speaks forth in anger.

23
00:02:57,005 --> 00:03:01,005
Then out of the darkness,
the prophecy relives,

24
00:03:01,213 --> 00:03:04,130
for Toron cast his seed
upon the wind,

25
00:03:04,338 --> 00:03:07,213
and even in death, to him
is born u son.

26
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,505
H's here.

27
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:32,630
Yes, it's here.

28
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:35,838
- Don't worry,
it won't be long now.

29
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:38,922
Push.

30
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:49,505
Keep comin', push.

31
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,005
H's here.

32
00:03:52,213 --> 00:03:53,380
The baby's head is out.

33
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,588
Help me.
- Yes.

34
00:03:56,505 --> 00:03:57,297
Oh, there.

35
00:03:57,505 --> 00:03:58,797
Oh, it's u beautiful baby.

36
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,255
It's u boy.

37
00:04:10,088 --> 00:04:14,255
- He has
the sign Toron.

38
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,338
Take him, take your son.

39
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:20,755
May ihe Gods forgive you.

40
00:04:23,338 --> 00:04:25,630
He has the sign of Toron.

41
00:05:23,463 --> 00:05:24,505
It is done.

42
00:05:55,672 --> 00:05:59,422
- You can trust me, as
I trust you, holy one.

43
00:06:11,713 --> 00:06:14,463
Ooo.

44
00:06:17,755 --> 00:06:20,463
Go where you will, my beautiiul.

45
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,755
Lord, lord.

46
00:06:29,963 --> 00:06:31,713
The sign is in the sky.

47
00:06:32,797 --> 00:06:34,297
What are you saying, fool?

48
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,713
The animals cry out.

49
00:06:35,922 --> 00:06:38,922
And the wind, the trees,
the mountain.

50
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,505
The earth trembles like a virgin

51
00:06:40,713 --> 00:06:42,005
being drawn 1o the nuptial bed.

52
00:06:42,213 --> 00:06:45,630
Now the sky is the
color of flame, my lord.

53
00:06:50,422 --> 00:06:52,547
Can Toron have had a son?

54
00:06:52,547 --> 00:06:54,588
- Aster, we cannot
be certain yet.

55
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:56,505
All the signs tell us
that tonight,

56
00:06:56,713 --> 00:06:58,338
in some corner of this world,
a woman

57
00:06:58,547 --> 00:07:01,838
has given birth to the
child you speak of.

58
00:07:32,172 --> 00:07:35,255
There is no longer any doubt.

59
00:07:35,463 --> 00:07:39,505
In order to avert this
calamity, the child must die.

60
00:07:40,672 --> 00:07:44,838
And our uncieni kingdom will
never be profane by him.

61
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:50,255
- Hurry, buck
to the village.

62
00:07:50,463 --> 00:07:52,547
The sign of Toron!

63
00:07:52,547 --> 00:07:53,547
- The child will
bring ihe wrath

64
00:07:53,755 --> 00:07:55,797
of the Spider down upon us.

65
00:07:56,922 --> 00:07:59,338
The son of Toron is among us.

66
00:07:59,588 --> 00:08:01,755
His duty and his
mission is to put

67
00:08:01,963 --> 00:08:04,005
an end to our ancient ways.

68
00:08:04,963 --> 00:08:08,380
We must never allow him
to reach manhood.

69
00:08:09,505 --> 00:08:11,213
Gather your men together.

70
00:08:11,422 --> 00:08:14,797
Seek out the newborn, cmcl
extinguish their brief live.

71
00:08:15,005 --> 00:08:18,338
We must prevent the prophecy
from being fulfilled.

72
00:08:18,547 --> 00:08:20,630
- Long life
to the Spider!

73
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,630
- The child has the
sign or Toron over his heart.

74
00:09:55,838 --> 00:09:57,255
Find him, kill him!

75
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,297
- Catch them,
catch them all.

76
00:10:42,505 --> 00:10:45,172
- No, please,
have mercy.

77
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:23,505
- Now, High Priest, I will
make you bitterly repent.

78
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,963
The day you exiled me from
the Kingdom of ihe Spider,

79
00:11:29,963 --> 00:11:34,005
I, Gribu, will be avenged
through this iiny child.

80
00:11:58,797 --> 00:12:02,505
Grow fusi and grow strong,
young Aior.

81
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:04,172
You have much to do.

82
00:12:06,463 --> 00:12:07,713
- In the
pages of the Sacred Book

83
00:12:07,922 --> 00:12:11,255
it is written, "there will
come one from the North.

84
00:12:11,463 --> 00:12:13,713
"Tull warrior who will
challenge the rule

85
00:12:13,922 --> 00:12:15,380
"of the Spider King.

86
00:12:15,588 --> 00:12:19,422
"He will be culled Toron,
but he will be vanished.

87
00:12:19,422 --> 00:12:21,005
"And many years will
puss in which

88
00:12:21,213 --> 00:12:23,505
"the Spider reigns supreme,
but one day

89
00:12:23,713 --> 00:12:25,963
"there will come another,
for to Toron

90
00:12:26,172 --> 00:12:27,755
"will be born a son.

91
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:31,588
"An even mightier warrior
they will cull Ator.

92
00:12:31,797 --> 00:12:34,422
"When the time is near,
the Great Eagle

93
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:37,130
"will shed tears of blood,
then those

94
00:12:37,338 --> 00:12:39,838
"who defend the dark regions
of ihe Spider Kingdom

95
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:42,630
"musi prepare for battle,
for Ator

96
00:12:43,505 --> 00:12:46,505
"will cast light upon
ihe darkness. "

97
00:12:51,463 --> 00:12:52,922
Oh, Ancient One.

98
00:12:54,297 --> 00:12:57,297
The word of the
prophet was untrue.

99
00:12:57,505 --> 00:12:59,630
The son of Toron is no more.

100
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,380
The kingdom is safe at last.

101
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,505
Now you can spread your web.

102
00:13:06,713 --> 00:13:09,588
And all those who wulk on Earth,

103
00:13:09,838 --> 00:13:12,463
will be forced to your bidding.

104
00:13:24,963 --> 00:13:25,797
Gidrick?

105
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:26,630
Yes?

106
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,713
- Put cm edge
on ihis blade.

107
00:13:28,922 --> 00:13:30,130
Go ahead.

108
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,380
- Here, this is from us,
Nordyu.

109
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,088
Thank you.

110
00:14:22,922 --> 00:14:24,630
Who are you stranger?

111
00:14:24,838 --> 00:14:26,338
What do you want of us?

112
00:14:26,547 --> 00:14:28,755
- From this day on, you
will receive food,

113
00:14:28,963 --> 00:14:30,630
so that you may eat.

114
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:34,505
And you will be given
herbs that will cure you,

115
00:14:34,505 --> 00:14:36,672
and arms for ihe hunt.

116
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,588
And in return, you musi
raise this child

117
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:41,588
as your own.

118
00:14:43,213 --> 00:14:45,088
I've never seen you before.

119
00:14:45,297 --> 00:14:46,130
What is your name?

120
00:14:46,338 --> 00:14:47,880
- I um culled Gribu,
but it doesn't matter.

121
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:49,963
Better that you forget it.

122
00:14:50,172 --> 00:14:52,005
You will never see me again.

123
00:14:52,213 --> 00:14:54,880
But I will be keeping
an eye on you.

124
00:14:55,088 --> 00:14:56,338
And on him.

125
00:14:56,547 --> 00:14:58,380
- The boy will be in safe
hands with us.

126
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,005
We're Cl simple,
honest folk here,

127
00:15:00,213 --> 00:15:02,088
and I have milk enough.

128
00:15:02,297 --> 00:15:04,088
If this mun keeps his promise,

129
00:15:04,297 --> 00:15:07,963
we won't need the charity
of the villagers anymore.

130
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:09,963
You will luck nothing.

131
00:15:12,255 --> 00:15:14,838
Because nothing must lack Ator.

132
00:15:16,922 --> 00:15:17,755
Ator.

133
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:35,463
- You always
wanted a boy, didn't you?

134
00:15:35,463 --> 00:15:37,463
Oh yes, Ator.

135
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,880
Ator!

136
00:15:50,088 --> 00:15:51,547
I couldn't find you.

137
00:15:51,547 --> 00:15:54,463
Don't leave me like that, ever.

138
00:15:54,463 --> 00:15:56,922
But I was in ihe woods.

139
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,463
Here, I brought you a present.

140
00:16:00,297 --> 00:16:02,422
Oh, what's his name?

141
00:16:02,422 --> 00:16:03,547
Kiog

142
00:16:06,047 --> 00:16:07,130
Oh.

143
00:16:12,047 --> 00:16:13,922
I love you.

144
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,797
And I love you.

145
00:16:19,672 --> 00:16:21,463
Why can't we marry?

146
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:25,672
- Ator, we are
brother and sister.

147
00:16:33,922 --> 00:16:36,297
I'll talk with our father.

148
00:17:31,172 --> 00:17:34,630
- You're already a
better hunter than I am.

149
00:17:34,838 --> 00:17:37,213
Well I owe i1 to you, father.

150
00:17:37,422 --> 00:17:39,005
- What's the mutter with you,
Ator?

151
00:17:39,213 --> 00:17:41,130
You have sud eyes.

152
00:17:41,338 --> 00:17:43,630
Are you in love by any chance?

153
00:17:46,797 --> 00:17:48,172
Who told you?

154
00:17:48,422 --> 00:17:49,505
My heart told me.

155
00:17:49,505 --> 00:17:51,380
And your mother's heart.

156
00:17:51,588 --> 00:17:53,630
But there's nothing
wrong about that.

157
00:17:53,838 --> 00:17:57,797
All young men full in
love, and you're u mun now.

158
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:07,005
Father,

159
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:09,963
You See!

160
00:18:11,088 --> 00:18:13,505
I would've told you sooner.

161
00:18:13,505 --> 00:18:15,880
You remember how our ancestors

162
00:18:16,922 --> 00:18:19,463
used to allow marriage between

163
00:18:21,797 --> 00:18:23,297
brother and sister?

164
00:18:23,505 --> 00:18:25,922
I know times have changed, but-

165
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:29,963
- Ator, you don't know how
really happy you make me.

166
00:18:30,172 --> 00:18:32,963
Well then you're saying...

167
00:18:33,172 --> 00:18:35,422
You'd allow me to
marry my sister?

168
00:18:35,422 --> 00:18:37,380
She is not your sister.

169
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,297
Sunyu is not your sister.

170
00:18:40,172 --> 00:18:42,630
Come here, Nordya, come here.

171
00:18:42,838 --> 00:18:45,047
What is it, Burduk?

172
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:47,297
Ator and Sunyu want to marry.

173
00:18:47,505 --> 00:18:49,713
- He knows?
- Yes, I iust told him.

174
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:51,463
You mean he's not my brother?

175
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,297
No, my child, he is not.

176
00:18:54,505 --> 00:18:57,338
You both sucked the same
milk from ihe some breast,

177
00:18:57,547 --> 00:18:59,130
but we are not his parents.

178
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,588
He is the offspring of
another couple.

179
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:07,797
Who are my parents?

180
00:19:08,005 --> 00:19:10,630
- A mun came out of the
woods with you.

181
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:12,255
My father?

182
00:19:12,463 --> 00:19:13,713
I don't think so.

183
00:19:13,922 --> 00:19:16,422
A recll parent would not
have abandoned his child

184
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:17,630
the way he did.

185
00:19:22,422 --> 00:19:23,630
- Why didn't you tell me,
mother?

186
00:19:23,838 --> 00:19:24,880
- We didn't, Ator,
'cause we thought

187
00:19:25,088 --> 00:19:27,047
it would make you unhappy.

188
00:19:28,505 --> 00:19:29,338
And now?

189
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:35,380
- And now that you have
decided to marry Sunyu

190
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,797
we are very happy for
both of you.

191
00:19:38,005 --> 00:19:39,172
Congratulations.

192
00:19:42,088 --> 00:19:44,838
- Well then you'll be my
parents for ihe second time.

193
00:19:45,047 --> 00:19:46,630
Did you hear that, Nordya?

194
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:49,130
I think we have to give the
good news to ihe whole village.

195
00:19:49,338 --> 00:19:49,963
Yes.

196
00:19:59,797 --> 00:20:01,130
MY lord?

197
00:20:01,338 --> 00:20:05,463
- I sincerely hope you have
something urgent to tell me.

198
00:20:05,463 --> 00:20:06,880
I say that because if
you have not,

199
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:09,672
you'll have to pay dearly
for this intrusion.

200
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,088
- The news I have for
you is of Griba.

201
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:13,963
Griba?

202
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:15,338
Yes, master.

203
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,255
I saw him ihis morning, my lord,

204
00:20:17,463 --> 00:20:19,255
in the forest by the
village that lies

205
00:20:19,463 --> 00:20:21,297
on the edge of our kingdom.

206
00:20:21,505 --> 00:20:24,088
- So he has dared to defy
our ancient laws once again.

207
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:26,380
This time, he shall die.

208
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,297
I want his head.

209
00:20:28,505 --> 00:20:29,630
You hear?

210
00:20:29,838 --> 00:20:30,838
Yes, master.

211
00:21:56,213 --> 00:22:01,088
- Oh, Corg, god of fecundity,
bless ihis young couple.

212
00:22:01,297 --> 00:22:04,672
Protect and purify them
with your great strength

213
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,922
so thclt they may offer
you their youth.

214
00:22:17,172 --> 00:22:19,588
Destroy them!

215
00:23:40,797 --> 00:23:43,130
Thank you.

216
00:24:19,922 --> 00:24:22,047
Find Griba, get him.

217
00:24:22,255 --> 00:24:24,005
I want his head.

218
00:24:37,338 --> 00:24:39,630
Griba, where are you?

219
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:42,630
Get me Gribu and you
will be spared.

220
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,213
Halt, don't kill the girl.

221
00:24:58,422 --> 00:24:59,672
Take her with him.

222
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,713
Let me go!

223
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:07,047
No, let me go!

224
00:25:08,713 --> 00:25:09,547
No

225
00:26:36,005 --> 00:26:36,838
Father.

226
00:28:19,797 --> 00:28:22,963
- You have learned to
fight like a tiger,

227
00:28:23,172 --> 00:28:24,755
but that is not sufficient.

228
00:28:24,963 --> 00:28:26,213
Now you must learn to
use your head

229
00:28:26,422 --> 00:28:28,630
and fight like a mun.

230
00:28:28,838 --> 00:28:30,713
- I thought you were one
of ihe Black Knights.

231
00:28:30,922 --> 00:28:32,463
They attacked my village,

232
00:28:32,672 --> 00:28:34,338
and killed my people.

233
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:36,130
They've stolen my wife.

234
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,838
Yes, I know, Ator.

235
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,838
How do you know my name?

236
00:28:41,047 --> 00:28:42,797
I've never seen you before.

237
00:28:43,797 --> 00:28:46,297
I know more about you

238
00:28:46,505 --> 00:28:48,755
than you know yourself.

239
00:28:48,963 --> 00:28:51,297
But no one has ever
known but me.

240
00:28:51,505 --> 00:28:53,255
I don't understand.

241
00:28:53,463 --> 00:28:57,130
- On your body, you bear
the mark of your destiny,

242
00:28:57,338 --> 00:28:59,255
but you cannot see it, yet.

243
00:28:59,463 --> 00:29:02,005
You were born to defeui
the Ancient One,

244
00:29:02,213 --> 00:29:03,797
the Spider King.

245
00:29:04,005 --> 00:29:06,630
You will be able to
see that mark,

246
00:29:06,838 --> 00:29:09,463
but first, you must
prepare yourself.

247
00:29:09,463 --> 00:29:12,130
The road ahead is long and hard.

248
00:29:13,005 --> 00:29:15,005
What do you mean?

249
00:29:15,213 --> 00:29:17,797
- I took you from the forest,
Ator,

250
00:29:18,005 --> 00:29:20,505
to save you from the
wrath of Dakkur,

251
00:29:20,713 --> 00:29:22,297
who hunts me now.

252
00:29:22,505 --> 00:29:24,588
I gave you to Nordyu, who
suckled you as her own

253
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:27,630
and raised you as cl
brother to Sunyu.

254
00:29:27,838 --> 00:29:29,963
What do you know about Sunyu?

255
00:29:30,172 --> 00:29:34,213
- Have no fear, for the
moment, she is in no danger.

256
00:29:35,047 --> 00:29:37,963
They wcmt her alive, and now,
come.

257
00:29:38,963 --> 00:29:40,505
You must follow me.

258
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:09,713
These are the weapons of
my vanquished enemies.

259
00:30:09,922 --> 00:30:13,047
As you can see, I have
had many enemies.

260
00:30:16,505 --> 00:30:17,838
The only weapons
missing are those

261
00:30:18,047 --> 00:30:20,505
of the High Preist, Dakkar.

262
00:30:20,505 --> 00:30:23,172
One day, I shall have them also.

263
00:30:25,797 --> 00:30:28,088
That belonged to Chun
ihe Terrible.

264
00:30:28,297 --> 00:30:30,130
I defeated him in combat
during ihe assault

265
00:30:30,338 --> 00:30:32,130
on the City of the
Winds, which was governed

266
00:30:32,338 --> 00:30:35,380
by the notorious Seven
Siamese Sisters.

267
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:39,380
Try to hit me.

268
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,630
What do you mean?

269
00:30:42,838 --> 00:30:43,505
Hi1 me.

270
00:30:46,088 --> 00:30:47,005
You sure?

271
00:30:58,505 --> 00:31:01,755
- The same rclshness cost
Chun his life.

272
00:31:02,963 --> 00:31:05,713
Now, rule number one
when you fight:

273
00:31:05,922 --> 00:31:07,505
keep the legs apart.

274
00:31:07,505 --> 00:31:11,255
With equilibrium of the
body distributed evenly.

275
00:31:11,463 --> 00:31:12,713
Like this?

276
00:31:16,547 --> 00:31:19,005
Rule number two: surprise.

277
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:21,088
Keep your wits about you,
and listen.

278
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:25,963
There are many secrets, Ator,
and you are here with me

279
00:31:26,172 --> 00:31:28,297
to learn them, i1 is
your destiny.

280
00:31:44,797 --> 00:31:48,630
(slow, tense orchestral music

281
00:31:55,505 --> 00:31:56,963
Again.

282
00:33:12,255 --> 00:33:13,088
Again.

283
00:33:29,005 --> 00:33:30,963
There she is!

284
00:34:05,463 --> 00:34:08,963
- Cowards, setting
upon a lone woman.

285
00:34:36,005 --> 00:34:38,505
Don'i I even get cl thunk
you for helping you out?

286
00:34:38,505 --> 00:34:40,463
I could've handled i1 alone,

287
00:34:40,463 --> 00:34:42,380
if you hadn't intruded.

288
00:34:43,255 --> 00:34:45,463
How was I to know?

289
00:34:45,672 --> 00:34:47,255
Were they trying to rob you?

290
00:34:47,463 --> 00:34:49,005
I was the one who robbed them.

291
00:35:00,422 --> 00:35:02,005
What's your name?

292
00:35:02,005 --> 00:35:03,547
I don't use names.

293
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,213
Ha!

294
00:35:16,505 --> 00:35:17,338
Griba!

295
00:35:22,172 --> 00:35:23,922
Griba, where are you?

296
00:35:46,963 --> 00:35:48,755
I've found it at lust.

297
00:35:50,505 --> 00:35:52,088
The sword of Toron.

298
00:36:07,422 --> 00:36:09,838
Now I'll avenge my honor.

299
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:48,672
Mhm.

300
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,838
A fine example of the species.

301
00:37:56,338 --> 00:37:59,088
He'll suit our
purpose very well.

302
00:38:03,713 --> 00:38:05,422
Tie him to the tree.

303
00:38:44,047 --> 00:38:45,755
Get the fighters here.

304
00:38:58,713 --> 00:39:01,130
The victor clt the end
of the contest

305
00:39:01,338 --> 00:39:03,922
will have the great
honor to bear the child

306
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:06,088
that is our future leader.

307
00:39:08,588 --> 00:39:10,505
Let the fighting start.

308
00:40:20,713 --> 00:40:24,005
You, Roon, will be the
one to curry in your body

309
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:27,213
ihe future Queen of our iribe.

310
00:40:27,422 --> 00:40:29,922
Now claim the prisoner,
he is yours for tonight.

311
00:40:29,922 --> 00:40:32,547
As the sun rises tomorrow,
you will kill him.

312
00:40:32,755 --> 00:40:35,005
You don't have much choice.

313
00:40:36,172 --> 00:40:40,880
Are you ready to perform
the duty that is my right?

314
00:40:41,088 --> 00:40:42,297
Well, well, no.

315
00:40:46,505 --> 00:40:47,463
Actually...

316
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:51,005
I love anoiher.

317
00:40:56,505 --> 00:40:58,838
And where is the lucky one?

318
00:40:59,047 --> 00:41:01,213
Where is this wonderful virgin?

319
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:04,297
Hm?

320
00:41:09,047 --> 00:41:11,213
Have you lost your iongue?

321
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:18,047
- She's being held captive in
the temple of the Ancient One.

322
00:41:19,172 --> 00:41:23,338
The Black Knights kidnapped
her from beneath my very eyes.

323
00:41:26,255 --> 00:41:27,630
But not for long.

324
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:34,255
- You want to desecruie
the iemple of the Spider?

325
00:41:34,463 --> 00:41:37,463
- I have no other
goal in my life.

326
00:41:37,463 --> 00:41:39,005
Alone?

327
00:41:39,213 --> 00:41:42,255
- I'm well prepared, I
can assure you.

328
00:41:43,047 --> 00:41:45,380
No one has ever returned alive

329
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,630
from the temple of the Spider.

330
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:51,088
The Holy Book sclys,
that only the son

331
00:41:51,297 --> 00:41:54,505
of Toron can defeat
the Ancient One.

332
00:41:54,505 --> 00:41:56,422
I will find her.

333
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,380
I will recover my love.

334
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,963
I hope she's still alive.

335
00:42:05,047 --> 00:42:06,672
I owe you my life.

336
00:42:08,838 --> 00:42:11,047
L1 occurs to you now.

337
00:42:11,255 --> 00:42:13,088
You wouldn't admit it by
the river bunk.

338
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:14,838
It's different now.

339
00:42:16,672 --> 00:42:20,047
Glad for that.

340
00:42:20,255 --> 00:42:24,297
- I will spare your life, but,
you must take me with you.

341
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:29,338
- Altruism doesn't suit you cmy
better than maternity, Roon.

342
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,755
What's your idea?

343
00:42:32,838 --> 00:42:34,172
Gold.

344
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,047
So much gold and
silver or iewels,

345
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,088
shut up in the temple
of the Spider.

346
00:42:41,297 --> 00:42:44,338
It could be ours without
any difficulty.

347
00:42:44,547 --> 00:42:46,130
That's my idea.

348
00:42:46,338 --> 00:42:48,422
L1 could change our fuiure.

349
00:42:51,505 --> 00:42:54,838
You haven't even told
me your name.

350
00:42:58,672 --> 00:43:01,172
I don't use names, remember?

351
00:43:17,297 --> 00:43:19,547
- That looks like the
sword of Toron.

352
00:43:19,755 --> 00:43:22,047
How did you come to have it?

353
00:43:22,255 --> 00:43:24,505
There's no time for that, now.

354
00:43:24,505 --> 00:43:27,047
We've got 1o get it back.

355
00:43:27,255 --> 00:43:29,838
But it's not going to be easy.

356
00:43:30,047 --> 00:43:32,547
Look, there are
guards over there.

357
00:43:32,547 --> 00:43:36,463
If they discover us, we
won't stand a chance.

358
00:43:36,463 --> 00:43:40,338
- I'll take cure of the
sword, you keep watch.

359
00:43:40,547 --> 00:43:41,130
Alright.

360
00:43:42,047 --> 00:43:45,172
- Our only hope lies in
distracting them.

361
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,255
- It's out in the
open, the guards will see you.

362
00:43:47,463 --> 00:43:49,797
- We'll leave than to
Kiog, he'll keep them busy.

363
00:43:50,005 --> 00:43:52,338
Go ahead, Kiog, create
a little chaos for us.

364
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:54,463
Go on.

365
00:44:11,338 --> 00:44:14,838
- What's going on?
- Let's go and find out.

366
00:44:25,755 --> 00:44:28,297
- They're
trying to get away!

367
00:44:28,505 --> 00:44:30,797
Catch them and bring them back!

368
00:44:31,005 --> 00:44:32,463
I want them captured.

369
00:44:32,672 --> 00:44:34,088
Quick, get moving!

370
00:44:39,713 --> 00:44:41,380
Come with me!

371
00:44:41,588 --> 00:44:42,838
We'll go this way.

372
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:44,255
Don't lei them escape!

373
00:44:54,422 --> 00:44:56,922
I found tracks here!

374
00:46:58,797 --> 00:46:59,630
Roon?

375
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:04,797
Where are you?

376
00:47:08,297 --> 00:47:09,130
Roon!

377
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:47,505
Sunya!

378
00:47:49,547 --> 00:47:51,130
Sunya, wait for me!

379
00:48:06,838 --> 00:48:08,130
Ator!

380
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,213
Come!

381
00:48:11,172 --> 00:48:12,172
I'm in here.

382
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:17,630
Follow me, Ator.

383
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:38,380
Ator, come to me, I'm here!

384
00:48:39,713 --> 00:48:40,547
Sunyu.

385
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,130
Butflll

386
00:48:46,338 --> 00:48:47,380
You're not...

387
00:48:47,588 --> 00:48:50,255
It doesn't mafler who I um.

388
00:49:02,547 --> 00:49:04,047
You must be tired.

389
00:49:05,505 --> 00:49:07,047
Here.

390
00:49:07,255 --> 00:49:08,005
Drink this.

391
00:49:33,588 --> 00:49:34,463
Nq!

392
00:49:35,713 --> 00:49:37,630
Never touch that drape.

393
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,047
I was expecting you.

394
00:50:11,213 --> 00:50:13,797
You will be happy here.

395
00:50:14,005 --> 00:50:15,755
It's peaceful.

396
00:50:15,963 --> 00:50:17,713
The days run into the nights,

397
00:50:17,922 --> 00:50:19,755
and ihe nights into the days.

398
00:50:19,963 --> 00:50:21,755
Time will mean nothing to you.

399
00:50:21,963 --> 00:50:25,963
You will feel that you've
stepped into eternity.

400
00:50:26,172 --> 00:50:28,047
Here we are all immortal.

401
00:50:30,422 --> 00:50:31,963
She looked at me.

402
00:50:32,838 --> 00:50:34,338
I heard her voice.

403
00:50:34,547 --> 00:50:35,838
She smiled at me.

404
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:40,463
She smiled at you, did she?

405
00:50:40,463 --> 00:50:42,172
That's what you thought.

406
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:44,880
Do you want to see your beloved?

407
00:50:54,838 --> 00:50:55,672
Come here.

408
00:50:57,672 --> 00:50:58,505
Come on.

409
00:51:04,088 --> 00:51:06,672
I will show you your loved one.

410
00:51:18,297 --> 00:51:20,880
I will show you your loved one.

411
00:51:28,505 --> 00:51:29,922
Sunyu.

412
00:52:24,255 --> 00:52:26,630
No.

413
00:52:36,797 --> 00:52:38,297
That's impossible.

414
00:52:39,172 --> 00:52:40,797
No, my dear.

415
00:52:41,005 --> 00:52:44,297
That was the girl you
gave year heart to.

416
00:52:44,505 --> 00:52:46,713
You suw her with your own eyes.

417
00:52:46,922 --> 00:52:48,505
She is only too happy to
have been chosen

418
00:52:48,713 --> 00:52:50,922
to wed the Ancient One.

419
00:53:08,838 --> 00:53:10,588
You will be mine
until you have no

420
00:53:10,797 --> 00:53:12,963
strength left to gratify me.

421
00:53:34,838 --> 00:53:35,672
KiOg!

422
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:41,047
Good boy, you found me.

423
00:53:41,255 --> 00:53:42,297
Help me escape!

424
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:44,838
Come on, Kiog.

425
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:47,797
Hurry!

426
00:53:51,547 --> 00:53:54,005
Come on, Kiog, you can do it!

427
00:54:07,213 --> 00:54:10,380
- Indun, how
beautiful you are.

428
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:15,963
The sight of your face
fills me with strange ioy.

429
00:54:23,963 --> 00:54:25,880
Your iouch, is ecstasy.

430
00:55:33,505 --> 00:55:37,130
- This is Prince Sultan,
of the Zori tribe.

431
00:55:38,088 --> 00:55:41,463
He opposed my will and I
transformed him

432
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:44,838
into an owl that has to
sit on u perch.

433
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:48,797
Come, Ator.

434
00:56:45,505 --> 00:56:46,838
You know what to do, Kiog.

435
00:56:47,047 --> 00:56:47,672
Go on!

436
00:57:20,463 --> 00:57:21,797
Get out of here!

437
00:57:44,505 --> 00:57:46,463
Ator, a curse on you.

438
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:49,338
Come quickly.

439
00:57:49,547 --> 00:57:50,213
Escape while you can.

440
00:57:50,422 --> 00:57:52,547
- You'll pay
for this Aior.

441
00:57:52,755 --> 00:57:54,130
I shall be avenged.

442
00:58:19,297 --> 00:58:22,172
- If we can gei
through this iungle,

443
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:25,088
we will be out of
lndun's territory.

444
00:58:25,297 --> 00:58:26,338
It's too still.

445
00:58:26,547 --> 00:58:27,963
- Now we must puss
through the land

446
00:58:28,172 --> 00:58:29,630
of the walking dead.

447
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:32,172
Well, if we gotta go.

448
01:00:58,713 --> 01:01:00,422
They've disappeared.

449
01:01:01,463 --> 01:01:04,380
Come on, let's get out of here.

450
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:16,380
Ah.

451
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:19,213
Join you for u iug?

452
01:01:19,422 --> 01:01:20,713
Yeah, why not.

453
01:01:20,922 --> 01:01:22,213
Suit yourseli.

454
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:34,713
- Alright if I take her
for two clesidrus, huh?

455
01:01:34,922 --> 01:01:35,547
Mm, mhm.

456
01:01:39,172 --> 01:01:40,005
Thank you.

457
01:01:41,505 --> 01:01:42,963
Come on.

458
01:01:46,422 --> 01:01:48,422
- Hey, where do you
think you're goin'?

459
01:01:48,422 --> 01:01:49,713
Let the mun look at ya.

460
01:01:49,922 --> 01:01:51,005
Yes, she's fine.

461
01:01:51,213 --> 01:01:52,297
Here, take this.

462
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:07,755
We need two horses.

463
01:02:07,963 --> 01:02:11,713
I'm sure the cripple will
know how to get them.

464
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:17,922
- I think it'll be more
expensive than you reckon.

465
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:19,297
- I don't think you
need to worry

466
01:02:19,505 --> 01:02:21,297
too much about the cost.

467
01:02:24,547 --> 01:02:25,505
Watch this.

468
01:02:31,213 --> 01:02:34,672
Lisien now, I told you once,
I told you thousand iimes.

469
01:02:37,463 --> 01:02:41,088
Leave her alone, waste
your money on these women.

470
01:02:41,297 --> 01:02:44,755
- You'll give me a heart
attack, that's my money!

471
01:02:49,588 --> 01:02:51,713
- I never saw her in
my life before.

472
01:02:51,922 --> 01:02:52,547
Who is she?

473
01:03:11,922 --> 01:03:13,088
Griba, wait!

474
01:03:19,088 --> 01:03:20,588
What's ihe hurry?

475
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,630
Griba, Griba, wait!

476
01:04:00,172 --> 01:04:01,547
I'll take care of her.

477
01:04:01,547 --> 01:04:05,630
Don't be stupid.

478
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:09,255
- I clm the only one to
posses the secret

479
01:04:09,463 --> 01:04:11,547
of your true identity, Aior.

480
01:04:13,213 --> 01:04:17,172
And I ccm restore the proof
of your birth to you now,

481
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:20,172
as I hid it from you when
you were a baby.

482
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:23,172
Here is the mark of Toron,
your father.

483
01:04:24,505 --> 01:04:27,505
Yes, Ator, you are the
son of Toron.

484
01:04:34,172 --> 01:04:38,338
It is of you, the sacred
books, have wriflen,

485
01:04:38,672 --> 01:04:42,505
and of your destiny to
defeat the Ancient One.

486
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:45,880
And now,

487
01:04:47,088 --> 01:04:49,505
ufier long years of patience,

488
01:04:50,797 --> 01:04:52,505
the moment has come.

489
01:04:54,005 --> 01:04:56,422
Now you must go to to
the Volcano of Shadows

490
01:04:56,422 --> 01:04:58,797
and take possession of
the Shield of Mordor,

491
01:04:59,005 --> 01:05:01,672
the shield which
wards off death.

492
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:03,755
It will render you immortal,
us long as it

493
01:05:03,963 --> 01:05:05,588
remains in your keeping.

494
01:05:05,588 --> 01:05:07,213
Then you will fulfill
your destiny

495
01:05:07,422 --> 01:05:09,547
in the temple of the Spider.

496
01:05:13,338 --> 01:05:17,505
From this clcly on, you will
have no further need of me.

497
01:05:32,672 --> 01:05:34,130
Tears of blood.

498
01:05:35,505 --> 01:05:37,088
Son of Toron lives.

499
01:05:39,672 --> 01:05:40,505
Gah.

500
01:05:50,963 --> 01:05:53,463
I was counting on you, Aior.

501
01:05:54,338 --> 01:05:57,380
- Oh, I thought you always
counted on yourself.

502
01:05:57,380 --> 01:05:58,213
Ugh.

503
01:06:08,463 --> 01:06:12,297
- Black Knights, prepare
your men to defend

504
01:06:12,505 --> 01:06:14,963
the Kingdom of the Ancient One.

505
01:06:15,172 --> 01:06:17,630
The son of Toron has returned,

506
01:06:17,630 --> 01:06:21,047
on the same mission
as his father,

507
01:06:21,255 --> 01:06:24,463
and our old enemy must
be vanquished,

508
01:06:24,672 --> 01:06:27,922
and the Spider's kingdom
saved from the fate

509
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:29,588
Aior intends for it.

510
01:06:32,297 --> 01:06:35,088
I, Dukkur, have no fear
of holy books.

511
01:06:35,547 --> 01:06:37,880
It is not the prophet
of the Spider,

512
01:06:38,088 --> 01:06:40,422
who decides the
course of destiny.

513
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:42,922
- Long life
to the Spider.

514
01:06:56,255 --> 01:06:58,463
Look, Roon, there it is.

515
01:07:01,713 --> 01:07:03,963
The heart of that volcano,

516
01:07:04,172 --> 01:07:05,797
in its shadows,

517
01:07:06,005 --> 01:07:07,672
lies the shield of Mordor.

518
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:10,838
It possesses magic
powers, and I must have it

519
01:07:11,047 --> 01:07:13,755
in order to fight the
Ancient One.

520
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:15,630
I'll help you get it.

521
01:07:15,838 --> 01:07:18,588
- The shield is my destiny,
not yours.

522
01:07:18,797 --> 01:07:21,505
- What do you know
about my destiny?

523
01:07:21,713 --> 01:07:22,672
Not yet, wait.

524
01:07:26,005 --> 01:07:27,047
We'll have to puss
through ihe caverns

525
01:07:27,255 --> 01:07:28,880
of the Blind Warriors.

526
01:07:30,088 --> 01:07:32,130
They have Cl highly
developed sense of smell,

527
01:07:32,338 --> 01:07:34,588
so rub these leclves
on your skin,

528
01:07:34,797 --> 01:07:37,047
and they won't be able
to detect us.

529
01:07:51,838 --> 01:07:53,338
The sign of Toron.

530
01:07:55,422 --> 01:07:57,755
So you are ihe son of Toron.

531
01:07:58,838 --> 01:08:01,755
I don't understand,
why didn't you tell me?

532
01:08:01,963 --> 01:08:03,422
Even I didn't know about it

533
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:05,047
until a little while ago.

534
01:08:07,755 --> 01:08:10,213
A man's fuie is only
revealed to him

535
01:08:10,422 --> 01:08:12,630
when he's halfway
through his life.

536
01:08:14,505 --> 01:08:16,297
If it were revealed sooner,
i1 would

537
01:08:16,505 --> 01:08:18,130
only seem an illusion.

538
01:08:19,047 --> 01:08:21,880
- So then it was not
your beloved Sunya

539
01:08:22,088 --> 01:08:25,922
who drove you to the
Kingdom of the Ancient One.

540
01:08:27,422 --> 01:08:31,588
- Sunycl's not cm illusion,
if that's what you think.

541
01:08:35,547 --> 01:08:38,088
Sunyu is u part of my destiny.

542
01:10:37,922 --> 01:10:38,922
You alright?

543
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:20,672
Ator!

544
01:14:26,047 --> 01:14:28,880
- So that's what Mordor's
power consists of.

545
01:14:29,088 --> 01:14:30,130
Don't you realize?

546
01:14:30,338 --> 01:14:34,297
If i1 has struck me, the
shield would've been yours.

547
01:14:34,505 --> 01:14:36,630
- I'm not interested
in the shield.

548
01:14:36,838 --> 01:14:39,130
It's of no value to me.

549
01:14:39,338 --> 01:14:41,047
That's true.

550
01:14:41,255 --> 01:14:43,463
YOUI' COFICEFH iS the TFECISUFE.

551
01:14:43,672 --> 01:14:46,213
- Thufs the only
reason I'm with you.

552
01:14:46,422 --> 01:14:48,922
We both found what we
were looking for.

553
01:14:49,130 --> 01:14:49,713
Wait!

554
01:14:49,922 --> 01:14:51,380
I want my treasure.

555
01:14:52,297 --> 01:14:53,213
Leave it.

556
01:14:54,213 --> 01:14:57,630
You'll soon have cull the
gold of the Ancient One.

557
01:15:53,005 --> 01:15:55,963
Roon, let's get out of here.

558
01:16:10,130 --> 01:16:12,255
- Long life
for the Spider!

559
01:18:17,547 --> 01:18:19,505
The Spider's treasure, Ator.

560
01:18:19,505 --> 01:18:22,380
The richesi treasure
in the world.

561
01:18:23,505 --> 01:18:24,380
Yes.

562
01:18:25,255 --> 01:18:27,088
Your blessed treasure.

563
01:18:30,463 --> 01:18:33,380
And now I think our
paths separate.

564
01:18:35,130 --> 01:18:36,588
I must find Sunyu.

565
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:43,047
Now nothing stands between
you and your destiny.

566
01:18:47,547 --> 01:18:50,047
Our ways, Ator, divide here.

567
01:18:55,463 --> 01:18:56,838
Come on!

568
01:19:15,505 --> 01:19:18,588
- They have invaded
ihe Temple of the Spider.

569
01:19:18,797 --> 01:19:19,422
Kill them!

570
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:21,213
Follow me!

571
01:19:35,505 --> 01:19:36,880
Welcome, Ator.

572
01:20:39,755 --> 01:20:43,005
- Now you will
die like a dog.

573
01:21:18,463 --> 01:21:21,005
Help!

574
01:21:21,213 --> 01:21:23,547
Thai sounds like Sunya.

575
01:21:23,755 --> 01:21:24,422
Go.

576
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:02,713
Help!

577
01:22:04,172 --> 01:22:04,963
Save me!

578
01:22:09,922 --> 01:22:10,755
Sunya!

579
01:22:13,005 --> 01:22:14,463
What are you doing here?

580
01:22:14,672 --> 01:22:18,213
- No one can obstruct
the will of the Spider.

581
01:22:22,047 --> 01:22:26,005
Not even ihe son of Toron.

582
01:22:27,755 --> 01:22:30,713
- But it was you who
guided me to this place.

583
01:22:30,922 --> 01:22:34,297
- In order to regain my
rightful place

584
01:22:34,505 --> 01:22:38,505
and only to return to
what I have always been.

585
01:22:38,505 --> 01:22:40,963
The High Priest of the Spider.

586
01:23:40,422 --> 01:23:41,797
I am your priest!

587
01:23:45,838 --> 01:23:48,255
Nq!

588
01:23:55,255 --> 01:23:57,838
Ator, take me away from here.

589
01:24:01,255 --> 01:24:05,838
- First I must complete
what I was born to do.

590
01:27:24,713 --> 01:27:25,713
Oh.

591
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:32,547
Roon.

592
01:27:45,755 --> 01:27:49,547
- Won't you lei me see
your beloved Sunyu?

593
01:27:49,755 --> 01:27:51,130
Yes, of course.

594
01:27:51,338 --> 01:27:52,672
I'll go get her.

595
01:27:54,047 --> 01:27:54,880
No, no.

596
01:27:56,422 --> 01:27:58,963
Perhaps, it's better like this.

597
01:28:01,047 --> 01:28:02,630
If I can't see her,

598
01:28:05,047 --> 01:28:06,797
I could still believe

599
01:28:08,088 --> 01:28:09,255
she's iust one

600
01:28:11,047 --> 01:28:11,838
of your...

601
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:14,713
Illusions.

602
01:28:16,630 --> 01:28:17,463
Roon.

603
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:19,713
Roon.
