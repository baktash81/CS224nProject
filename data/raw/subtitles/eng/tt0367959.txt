00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,471
Whoa! Oh, oh, oh!

186
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:29,141
Go. Go, go, go. All in.

187
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:32,577
Come on, come on, come on.

188
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:40,587
Dump the body!
Dump the body immediately!

189
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:48,659
(whimpering)

190
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,338
(wolf baying)

191
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,387
- (rock clangs)
- (growling)

192
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,197
(radio buzzes)

193
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,330
They're shooting looters.

194
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:28,998
Stop and black out.

195
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,546
(distant explosion)

196
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,661
- (door bangs open)
- Move back!

197
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:53,263
(growling)

198
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,390
MAN: Don't shoot!

199
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,024
Come on!

200
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:57,295
(growling)

201
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:04,798
Come on.

202
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:07,072
- Put it down.
- Drop it now, you little fuck!

203
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,080
Put it down!

204
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,513
Or we shoot her.

205
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,107
Give me that.

206
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,776
Get the radio, Kolnas.

207
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,798
We're lucky. Only kids.

208
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,933
If a patrol comes by...

209
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,734
we saved them...

210
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,776
and their family's stuff.

211
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,277
Hey, Dortlich.

212
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,904
Grentz, check the door.

213
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,972
Pot watcher.

214
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,778
Check upstairs.

215
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,216
Find some food.

216
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:54,218
Hey, only rotten potatoes.

217
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,688
(grunts)

218
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:04,395
GRUTAS: Find something.
Try the-- try the Germans.

219
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,270
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

220
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,939
GRUTAS: Listen,
I need information, you idiot.

221
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,746
It's not a fucking toy.

222
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:22,844
MILKO: Wait, I have found something
under Russian frequency.

223
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,027
GRUTAS: Roadblocks.

224
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,794
Every five kilometers
from here to Vilnius.

225
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:42,299
So, we're stuck for now, hmm?

226
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:58,822
Once we were Lithuanian.

227
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,324
Now we are Russians.

228
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,292
We were Germans before.

229
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,496
Medics.

230
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:06,588
Police.

231
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,724
And what are we
at this moment?

232
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:13,060
At this moment,
we are starving.

233
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,163
- Unh!
- Did you get something?

234
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,332
Freezing out there.

235
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:17,568
Open it.

236
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,536
You think these are peppercorns?

237
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,946
These are frozen maggots.

238
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,713
This was rotten before it froze!

239
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,987
(grunting)

240
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:39,690
I'll put this in your head!

241
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:40,925
Stop it, Grutas.

242
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,528
(Mischa coughs)

243
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,156
The boy is Hannibal Lecter...

244
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:19,367
...and the little girl is Mischa.

245
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,140
(slurping greedily)

246
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,220
(Grutas grunting)

247
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:52,535
We eat...

248
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:55,200
...or die.

249
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,140
(Mischa coughing)

250
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:26,802
(thunder rumbling)

251
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,534
(boys chanting drill)

252
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:34,468
(man directing them)

253
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,516
(clanging)

254
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:55,256
(singing in Russian)

255
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,554
Let's hear you, little master.

256
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,788
He's a mute.

257
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,420
He's not mute at night.

258
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,523
He can scream well enough,
and he'll sing.

259
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,831
This is not
your father's house anymore.

260
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,963
It's the People's Orphanage,

261
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:37,008
and you're just one more orphan.

262
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,406
Aah!

263
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:42,914
HEADMASTER: (banging)
Lecter! I'll see you in my office!

264
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:57,922
Hannibal, you do not honor
the human pecking order.

265
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:59,930
You're always hurting the bullies.

266
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,398
I know,

267
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:07,961
this was your mother's room.

268
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,702
Must be difficult for you
to live in this house.

269
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:14,769
Go to bed.

270
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,940
Go to bed!

271
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,621
Everything all right?

272
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,094
(moans)

273
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,697
(whimpering)

274
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:44,764
(groans)

275
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:47,509
- Ah!
- (growls)

276
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,568
No, please.

277
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:51,847
(screaming)

278
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:55,542
Mischa!

279
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:56,815
(banging)

280
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,079
Get up!

281
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,350
(chains rattling)

282
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,891
Now, scream all you please.

283
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:17,939
Every day, you'll pay for this.

284
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:22,811
Every day for the rest
of your short and nasty life.

285
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:34,788
(water dripping)

286
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:04,850
(clanging)

287
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,352
(sniffs)

288
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,692
(distant coughing)

289
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:51,466
(coughs)

290
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:21,298
Lecter!

291
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:25,295
He's not here.

292
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:27,964
This way.

293
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,168
(screams)

294
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,437
(groans)

295
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:55,966
(dogs barking)

296
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:17,685
Okay!

297
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,951
(speaks foreign language)

298
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,207
(whining and barking)

299
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:51,821
(alarm sounds)

300
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,154
(speaks Russian)

301
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,566
Boy!

302
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,310
(yelling)

303
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,316
(gunfire)

304
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:31,159
(train whistling)

305
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,998
(dogs barking)

306
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,669
(barks)

307
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,898
(growling)

308
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,809
SERGE: Who's there?

309
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:02,875
Some help you are.

310
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,319
Shoo! Go!

311
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,955
What is it, Serge?

312
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:12,360
A boy, madame.

313
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,990
He has pictures of you
and your husband.

314
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,736
Your uncle would have loved
to see you, Han.

315
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:57,798
It has been almost a year
since he died.

316
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,450
Only you and I are left now.

317
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,958
(clock chimes)

318
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:20,961
HANNIBAL: Mischa.

319
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,800
Mischa. Mischa.

320
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,233
Mischa.

321
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:37,945
<i>(men singing in German)</i>

322
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,953
Mischa! Mischa!

323
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:46,882
Mischa! Mischa!

324
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,391
Hannibal.

325
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,654
- Mischa!
- Hannibal.

326
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,060
Hannibal! Hannibal!
Wake up!

327
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:55,095
It's all right. It's all right.

328
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:02,004
When you sleep,
do you remember?

329
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,842
Do you remember
what happened to Mischa?

330
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:33,666
You look like your uncle, Hannibal.

331
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:40,373
Would you like to try?

332
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,376
Use this.

333
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:50,744
(water boiling)

334
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,523
(gasping) Hannibal!

335
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,204
Speak to me.

336
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,570
Thank you.

337
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:51,775
Hannibal.

338
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:06,413
Here is where I pray
to my ancestors

339
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:09,517
for strength, for courage.

340
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:18,159
I have the honor
only on my ancestor's birthday

341
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:19,999
to polish his armor

342
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:22,369
with oil of cloves.

343
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,749
(inhales)

344
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:41,586
This is after the fight
for Osaka Castle.

345
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:52,499
The samurai display
the heads of their enemies.

346
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:57,867
There are more suitable parchments
that will interest you.

347
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:02,709
Be gentle, Hannibal.

348
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,247
And be brave.

349
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,711
Like your father.

350
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,380
And like him.

351
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,898
You must be ready for anything.

352
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:26,061
Come.

353
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,532
Again.

354
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:37,011
Again.

355
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,175
Good.

356
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,517
- Again.
- All right.

357
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:07,134
(people chattering)

358
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,496
Hey, <i>japonaise</i>.

359
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,797
Hey, <i>japonaise</i>!

360
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,302
Monsieur, please.

361
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:41,509
- Is that all, madame?
- Yes.

362
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,274
Hey, <i>japonaise</i>, tell me the truth.

363
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,340
Does your pussy run crossways?

364
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:51,610
With a puff of straight hairs
like a little explosion?

365
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:55,383
Hannibal!

366
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:03,291
Don't move.

367
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,494
(whistles blowing)

368
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,439
The butcher tried to get the knife

369
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:19,449
while stating he would
kill everyone in the market.

370
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,009
Well...

371
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,516
The butcher... was Vichy,

372
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,184
a collaborator
with the German occupation.

373
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,389
He's much hated.

374
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,861
And I can deal with him.

375
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:43,069
Young man...

376
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,200
if you're to be a doctor,

377
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:47,471
you must be careful
with your hands.

378
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:49,103
No more fighting,

379
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,546
and never give more
than a single pass.

380
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,026
Forgive me.

381
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:12,365
I came now to seek revenge.

382
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:15,804
Hannibal needs peace.

383
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:32,565
(lyre music playing)

384
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,580
If you've pissed in my fuel tank,
I'll twist your head off!

385
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:49,689
- Paul Momund, the butcher.
- Ha!

386
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:53,791
You owe a certain lady an apology.

387
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:56,332
Apologize to <i>la japonaise</i>?

388
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,927
Boy, you must be crazy to come here.
I'll throw you in the river.

389
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,199
Or maybe I'll split your pants

390
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,264
and give you something you don't want

391
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,071
where you don't want it.

392
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:10,671
You inquired about her... pussy.

393
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:14,512
You speculated it ran which way?

394
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:16,450
Jap pussy runs crossways.

395
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,921
You should fuck that little Jap
and see for yourself, huh?

396
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,451
Crossways like that?

397
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,093
(gasping)

398
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,433
Aah!

399
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:39,299
Or more tangential to the spine?

400
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,004
Aah!

401
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,843
Aah!

402
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,953
Aah!

403
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:54,949
Ooh.

404
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,161
Do you see how your mouth
stains the air?

405
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,562
I should add that to my drawing.

406
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,263
Would you like to see it?

407
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:07,061
Aah! Aah!

408
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:09,129
(screaming)

409
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:23,517
(body hits ground)

410
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:49,237
Yum.

411
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:56,742
Wait for me.

412
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,456
You see, it was made
with a single blow.

413
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:06,894
Ah, Inspector Popil.
I'm very happy you could come.

414
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,455
You won't remember me,
but I was with the--

415
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:11,967
Of course.
You delivered De Rais to Nuremburg

416
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:13,367
and sat behind him.

417
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:15,200
I saw you bring the evidence.

418
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:17,567
It's an honor, sir.

419
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:22,744
- What do we have here?
- Paul Momund, or most of him.

420
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,405
You have his dossier.

421
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,142
Yes.

422
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:28,317
Fat and ugly.

423
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:31,081
He shipped Jews from Marseille.

424
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:34,486
He fought recently.

425
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:36,082
And often.

426
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,857
Last Saturday night, a bar fight.
He had many enemies.

427
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,364
A list, please.
His recent opponents.

428
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,294
You've done nothing to this body?

429
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:47,269
Oh, no, no, no, monsieur.
No, no.

430
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,828
The chief specifically--

431
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:50,100
The odor,

432
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,938
it's not of anything you use here?

433
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,444
It smells like that toothache remedy.

434
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,878
Yes, oil of cloves.

435
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:59,305
Let's see the pharmacist.

436
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,083
Look.

437
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:07,790
The most exquisite bits of the fish
are the cheeks.

438
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,723
This is true for many creatures.

439
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:12,956
When carving at the table,
you give one cheek to madame,

440
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,691
the other to the guest of honor.

441
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:15,959
Did you hear?

442
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:19,332
They haven't found the butcher's
damned ugly head yet.

443
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:39,347
(distant rustling)

444
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:48,380
- Good evening, my lady.
- (gasps)

445
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:55,222
I hope you don't mind.

446
00:43:55,299 --> 00:44:00,703
I would've used a butcher's knife,
but the sword seemed so appropriate.

447
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:15,375
Not a nick in the blade,
I promise you.

448
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:20,455
The butcher was like butter.

449
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:47,140
You didn't need to do this for me.

450
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:49,549
Rudeness is epidemic, my lady.

451
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,611
(horn honks outside)

452
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,221
Police.

453
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,562
They will call it murder.

454
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:09,097
At worst, a crime of passion.

455
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:16,537
Wash your hands.
Quickly.

456
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:18,137
Go!

457
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:23,919
Inspector Pop-il?

458
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:26,988
- Popil, madame.
- Popil.

459
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:31,192
Hannibal Lecter?

460
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:34,127
Good evening.

461
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:38,026
You fought with the butcher,
Paul Momund, in the market.

462
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,001
Now he is dead.

463
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:44,202
I must ask you
to come along with me.

464
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:50,445
MAN: Is your name Hannibal Lecter?

465
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:53,040
Yes.

466
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:59,518
Do you have any guilty knowledge
of the death of Paul Momund?

467
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:02,014
Guilty knowledge?

468
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,617
Limit your responses to yes or no.

469
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:08,761
No.

470
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,670
It's vanilla.

471
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:18,803
He reacts to nothing.

472
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,969
It's monstrous.

473
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:30,516
The butcher had been fishing.

474
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:34,785
There was blood and scales
on his knife, but no fish.

475
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:36,792
The tape tells you all that?

476
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,527
Remarkable.

477
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:42,493
No.

478
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:47,459
The chef told me you brought
a splendid fish in for dinner.

479
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:49,938
Where did you get that fish?

480
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:51,941
By fishing, Inspector.

481
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:55,877
We keep a baited line in the water
behind the boathouse.

482
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:57,937
I'll show you if you like.

483
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:00,774
My specialty is war crimes.

484
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:05,287
And I know they
do not end with the war.

485
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:08,288
You lost your entire family.

486
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:11,719
So did I.

487
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:15,663
And for you, your beautiful aunt came
and made up for it all.

488
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:20,563
The very scent of her must have
taken away the smell of the camp.

489
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:23,902
So when Paul the butcher
spewed filth at her,

490
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:26,408
I can understand if you killed him.

491
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:29,036
Tell me what happened, Hannibal.

492
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:33,582
Together we could
show a court there was--

493
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:37,245
The very scent of her
takes away the smell of the camp.

494
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:41,049
Do you compose verse, Inspector?

495
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:42,989
And keep it under your pillow?

496
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:07,850
Now, tell me, Inspector,
did you choose war crimes...

497
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:11,216
...because you lost family
in the war?

498
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:12,619
Yes.

499
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:14,788
How?

500
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:19,121
Some in combat,
some were shipped east.

501
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:20,891
Did you catch who did it?

502
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:22,363
No.

503
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,098
But they were Vichy,
men like the butcher?

504
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:27,158
Yes.

505
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:31,731
Then we are both suspects.

506
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:34,943
I can say you were
fishing with me, if you like.

507
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:38,712
(knock on door, door opens)

508
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:40,613
MAN: Inspector, you should see this.

509
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:45,519
I told you--
keep these people away.

510
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:48,614
(crowd chattering)

511
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:55,488
- It's the butcher?
- Yes, sir.

512
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:56,589
How long?

513
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:58,862
OFFICER: Ten minutes.
No longer.

514
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:25,952
Wait here, please.

515
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:34,899
Madame, so sorry to disturb you.
I was passing with the papers.

516
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:39,773
Um, your legal residency
in France is threatened, madame.

517
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:41,470
We can delay the death duties

518
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:43,843
so you can stay in the house
for the time being,

519
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:48,214
but inevitably, the state will take it
and sell it at auction.

520
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:50,378
You will have to let the staff go.

521
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:51,512
Good night.

522
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,767
Father, Mother...

523
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:10,297
I'm the youngest student
they've ever admitted into medical school.

524
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:13,600
It's a work scholarship.

525
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,168
I think you would be pleased.

526
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:21,349
<i>Death duties on my uncle's estate</i>

527
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:24,353
<i>have finally forced the sale</i>
<i>of the chateau.</i>

528
00:50:25,322 --> 00:50:28,155
<i>Lady Murasaki</i>
<i>will leave for Paris with me.</i>

529
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:41,063
<i>This work scholarship means</i>
<i>I must spend much of my spare time</i>

530
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:43,902
<i>preparing bodies</i>
<i>for the anatomy class.</i>

531
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:49,471
<i>My studies are fascinating</i>

532
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,776
<i>and absorb me completely.</i>

533
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,417
<i>Yet I still find myself thinking</i>
<i>about my sister</i>

534
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:02,185
<i>and the men who took her from me.</i>

535
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:04,318
MISCHA: <i>Let me go!</i>

536
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:11,865
Do you suppose God
intended to eat Isaac?

537
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:16,266
That's why he told
Abraham to kill him.

538
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:18,906
Eat him?

539
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:20,374
Of course not.

540
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:24,280
The Angel intervenes in time.

541
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:28,383
Not always.

542
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:37,652
I have to know about Mischa.

543
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:43,858
I can see their faces in my dreams,

544
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:47,597
but I can't remember what they called
each other with their bloody mouths.

545
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:52,864
I would give anything to remember.

546
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,177
Hannibal...

547
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:03,243
Memory is a knife.
It can hurt you.

548
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:29,577
I want to stay here with you.

549
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,882
No.
You must stay at school.

550
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,102
POPIL: Louis,
I need you to remember.

551
00:52:57,641 --> 00:53:00,633
Who told the Nazis
where the children were hidden?

552
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:03,206
You must remember.

553
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:08,080
I can't bear to think about it.

554
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:10,944
This will help you remember.

555
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:15,056
Hannibal Lecter.

556
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,319
What are you doing here?

557
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,753
The body.

558
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:22,059
I'm a medical student now.

559
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:25,226
Yes, I know.
I have followed your progress.

560
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:27,600
You repeat nothing
you hear in this room.

561
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:30,802
(Louis coughing)

562
00:53:32,008 --> 00:53:33,839
POPIL: Please, Louis...

563
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:36,378
Klaus Barbie shipped
the children to Auschwitz.

564
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:38,573
Who told him
where the children were hidden?

565
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:40,275
Did you tell him?

566
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:47,817
When they broke my fingers,
I gave them Pardou.

567
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:53,729
Pardou knew where
the children were hidden.

568
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,865
He's mayor of Belleville now.

569
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:01,995
(laughs)

570
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:04,635
Thank you, Louis.

571
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:06,073
Inspector.

572
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:07,541
Yes?

573
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:09,772
Where were the police?

574
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:13,204
(spits)

575
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,730
(priest praying in Latin)

576
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:31,358
LOUIS: No, no, no.
Please, please.

577
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:33,425
(priest continues praying)

578
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:51,547
You knew at once
what Louis wanted, didn't you?

579
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:55,520
His crucifix to remain with his brain,
not his heart.

580
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:59,593
He answered <i>your</i> question,
but you didn't answer his.

581
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:04,824
Where <i>were</i> the police when the Nazis
threw the children into the trucks?

582
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:09,399
(praying)

583
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,686
<i>(soft piano music playing)</i>

584
00:55:30,593 --> 00:55:32,686
(thunder crashes)

585
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:42,659
MISCHA: <i>Hannibal!</i>

586
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:54,802
<i>(woman singing in German)</i>

587
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:00,773
<i>Come and play.</i>

588
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:04,081
<i>One little cheek.</i>

589
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:07,653
<i>Two little cheeks.</i>

590
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,452
<i>Cough.</i>

591
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:11,887
<i>(coughs)</i>

592
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:13,792
<i>She has pneumonia.</i>

593
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:15,353
<i>Let's take her.</i>

594
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:18,633
<i>She's going to die anyway.</i>

595
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:21,636

596
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:27,499

<i>Hannibal!</i>

598
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:45,224
<i>(bomb whistling)</i>

599
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:47,687
<i>(scream)</i>

600
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:50,395
<i>Come on!</i>

601
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:53,926
- <i>Get out!</i>
- <i>Grutas. wait!</i>

602
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:56,599
<i>The dog tags.</i>

603
00:57:57,874 --> 00:57:59,307
