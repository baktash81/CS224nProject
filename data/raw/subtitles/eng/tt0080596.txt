1
00:00:01,636 --> 00:00:04,238
(wind howling)

2
00:00:06,508 --> 00:00:09,343
(bats screeching)

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,421
(eerie music)

4
00:01:21,816 --> 00:01:24,719
(foreboding music)

5
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:13,568
- [Man] Hello? Can you hear me?

6
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:15,903
Can anyone hear me?

7
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:19,373
I don't know where I am.

8
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:21,876
I don't know where I am anymore.

9
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:25,445
I don't know what
century I'm in.

10
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,782
There is a message
I must get through

11
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,784
to anyone who can hear me.

12
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:33,320
When I was out among you,

13
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:36,591
I always believed, as you did,

14
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:40,695
that time exists in
a sequential pattern,

15
00:02:41,663 --> 00:02:44,197
one day following another,

16
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:45,767
one year after another,

17
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:51,405
each century following
the previous one.

18
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:52,940
But it's not like that at all.

19
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,177
I can tell you that
now because I know it.

20
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:58,846
Believe me.

21
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:04,284
You see, time exists
in a continuum.

22
00:03:05,987 --> 00:03:11,191
I've found words spoken
thousands of years ago

23
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:17,197
are still around somewhere in
the vast infinity of space.

24
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:20,835
The future, as we call it,

25
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:24,639
that too is with us now.

26
00:03:25,907 --> 00:03:29,476
Past, present, and future

27
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,479
are constantly in conflict
in a finite world.

28
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:37,652
On a planet known as Earth,
which I once inhabited,

29
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:39,319
we think of time as something

30
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:42,890
that is happening now,
that the past is gone,

31
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:45,459
that the future is not yet.

32
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:47,528
But that's not so.

33
00:03:48,963 --> 00:03:51,032
If anyone can hear me,

34
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:56,269
know that yesterday,
today, and tomorrow

35
00:03:57,038 --> 00:03:58,973
are constantly with us

36
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:02,009
and will be with us
through all eternity.

37
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:10,985
(mysterious music)

38
00:04:16,524 --> 00:04:19,359
(lights booming)

39
00:04:40,548 --> 00:04:43,450
(insects chirping)

40
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,454
(suspenseful music)

41
00:04:49,924 --> 00:04:53,728
(whirring lights warbling)

42
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:06,974
(mysterious music)

43
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,998
- It sure will be good
to see the family again.

44
00:05:31,032 --> 00:05:32,399
- Yeah.

45
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,134
I'll bet Jenny has
grown at least a foot

46
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,836
in the last three months.

47
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:37,939
- (laughs) They must have
had one hell of a vacation.

48
00:05:37,972 --> 00:05:39,472
- Well, if you're
gonna build a house,

49
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:41,008
you've gotta get your
family out of the way.

50
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:42,710
- Tell me about it.
- Across the country

51
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:43,778
observed a most extraordinary
event at 5:23 this morning.

52
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:47,815
- Hey, get a load of that.
- A trinary supernova,

53
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:50,751
a simultaneous explosion
of three giant stars

54
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:52,019
located in the center of the-

55
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:53,020
- Hey, we better get
a move on if we want

56
00:05:53,054 --> 00:05:55,022
to reach that plane on time.
- Clearly visible

57
00:05:55,056 --> 00:05:56,724
in the early morning sky.

58
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:58,926
Scientists tell us that
the actual event occurred

59
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,728
several hundred years ago

60
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:01,829
and that the light
and now the radiation

61
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:05,465
from the explosion are just
now reaching our planet.

62
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,034
Radio telescopes
around the world

63
00:06:07,068 --> 00:06:08,769
are studying the
skies today in hopes

64
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:11,973
of learning more about this
highly unusual occurrence.

65
00:06:12,006 --> 00:06:13,674
Meanwhile, authorities tell us

66
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,577
that the levels of radiation
reaching us from the supernova

67
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:20,548
are extremely small and pose
no immediate health hazard.

68
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:21,983
However, news services
around the world

69
00:06:22,016 --> 00:06:23,951
are reporting
electrical disturbances

70
00:06:23,985 --> 00:06:25,953
and radio interference.

71
00:06:25,987 --> 00:06:27,755
And here in the deserts
of Southern California,

72
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:30,591
we've even had some
reports of ground tremors.

73
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:34,095
We remind you that there is
currently no cause for alarm.

74
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:35,930
Scientists say
they have no reason

75
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:37,765
to expect any
further repercussions

76
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:41,068
from those
extraterrestrial exposures.

77
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:53,714
- (laughing) Hello!

78
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:55,016
- Oh, wonderful.

79
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:56,817
Come on over here, baby.

80
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:59,186
Hey! I'm glad to see you.

81
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,188
- We had a ball.
- Come here. Come here, baby.

82
00:07:01,222 --> 00:07:02,422
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

83
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,425
It's nice to be home, though.

84
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:11,198
- Come on. Let's get
you out of here, huh?

85
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:22,475
- [Richard] Honey, I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to drop you

86
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,979
at the new house and
run, and I mean run.

87
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:26,647
- Oh, no.
- I have these plans

88
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:28,549
I have to get out in
one hell of a rush.

89
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:30,551
I have to be in New
York within 24 hours.

90
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:32,485
- Daddy!

91
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,621
- Don't worry, sweetheart.

92
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:35,122
I'll be back late tonight.

93
00:07:37,158 --> 00:07:41,062
- Daddy, we were on a camel!
- (laughs) Oh, Jenny!

94
00:07:41,095 --> 00:07:43,197
- A camel, huh?
- You should have seen her!

95
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:47,568
- [Grant] That must've been
a lotta fun huh? My, my.

96
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:08,022
(light string music)

97
00:08:20,101 --> 00:08:20,935
- Oh!

98
00:08:22,203 --> 00:08:25,639
- Well, there it is,
finished product.

99
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:27,108
- Oh, Grant.

100
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:28,075
- What do you think of it, Beth?

101
00:08:28,109 --> 00:08:31,178
- Oh, Daddy, you did a
great job. (laughing)

102
00:08:31,212 --> 00:08:32,313
It's fabulous!

103
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:35,016
- That husband of yours is
the best goddamn draftsman

104
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:36,117
west of the Mississippi.

105
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,618
Damn good with his hands too.

106
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,154
It's all solar powered.

107
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,023
Everything is modern
as you can get.

108
00:08:42,056 --> 00:08:43,691
- Yeah. Even I like it.

109
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,793
- You're a tough
little kid to please.

110
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:47,561
Wait till you see the
surprise I got for you.

111
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:49,163
- Me too?

112
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,231
- Yeah, you too, baby.

113
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:52,666
- Follow me. Come
on, sweetheart.

114
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,537
(light wind instrument music)

115
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:10,151
Now you wait right there, Jenny.

116
00:09:10,184 --> 00:09:11,218
You too, Steve.

117
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,855
Close your eyes, both of you.

118
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:17,691
Now, don't you open them
until I tell you, okay?

119
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:26,333
- I bet it's a puppy dog.

120
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:28,936
- It's better than that.

121
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:30,604
- Keep 'em closed.

122
00:09:30,638 --> 00:09:31,639
Don't you open them yet.

123
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:33,908
Now you can open them.

124
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:35,142
- A pony!

125
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:37,278
- Wow! I'm going to
try him out right now.

126
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:38,279
Thanks, Dad.

127
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:39,914
- No. Better put him up, son.

128
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:41,182
We have to unpack the car.

129
00:09:41,215 --> 00:09:42,216
You can ride him later.

130
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,584
There's plenty of time.

131
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:46,353
- Thank you, Grandpa!

132
00:09:47,822 --> 00:09:49,824
- You can play with
him now, honey,

133
00:09:49,857 --> 00:09:51,992
but don't leave the corral.

134
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:53,194
Isn't he pretty?

135
00:09:55,296 --> 00:09:56,897
- What do you think
of them, Momma?

136
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:58,232
- Oh, beautiful choices.

137
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:05,339
- Let's split, huh?

138
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:12,213
(pony neighing)

139
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,383
(mysterious string music)

140
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:19,720
- Look, see?

141
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:23,958
Look.

142
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,260
Like her? Huh?

143
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:30,798
Look. Is this a cute baby?

144
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:31,765
Is it cute?

145
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,344
- You'd better hit the road.

146
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:44,411
Don't worry about this stuff.

147
00:10:44,445 --> 00:10:45,246
Steve and I will
take care of this.

148
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,313
- Okay. Thanks, Dad.

149
00:10:46,347 --> 00:10:47,181
- Take care, Steve.
- Bye.

150
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,620
- Sorry, honey. There's
no way out of it.

151
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:55,356
Jenny! Come say
goodbye to daddy.

152
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:57,258
- I know. I understand.

153
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,392
Will you call me?

154
00:10:58,425 --> 00:10:59,293
- As soon as I get in.

155
00:11:08,469 --> 00:11:09,870
- Hey, come back.

156
00:11:10,905 --> 00:11:13,140
You wait here. I'll be back.

157
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:15,843
(pony neighing)

158
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:20,147
(eerie music)

159
00:11:20,181 --> 00:11:23,184
(statue chittering)

160
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:43,737
Did you see my new pony?

161
00:11:48,543 --> 00:11:53,714
I want my new pony.

162
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,489
Please help me find my pony.

163
00:12:02,524 --> 00:12:05,492
(statue chiming)

164
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:11,065
- Jenny!

165
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:13,867
- Thank you.

166
00:12:22,443 --> 00:12:23,377
Bye, Daddy!

167
00:12:24,445 --> 00:12:25,312
- Goodbye, sugar.

168
00:12:26,514 --> 00:12:27,915
You be a good girl
for Mommy now, okay?

169
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:29,183
- I will, Daddy.

170
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:30,751
- All right. I'll
see you tomorrow.

171
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:37,258
Mm! I'll hurry back.

172
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:43,531
(engine igniting)

173
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:03,017
- Hey, Momma, let me
help you with that.

174
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,958
(soft suspenseful music)

175
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:12,326
- What happened?

176
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:15,563
- My god. I have no idea.

177
00:13:15,597 --> 00:13:20,200
- Oh, man. Looks like
some bikers came in.

178
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:22,369
- Bikers?
- Yeah.

179
00:13:22,403 --> 00:13:23,505
Before we went on vacation,

180
00:13:23,538 --> 00:13:25,039
I saw some guys hill climbing.

181
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:34,114
- Everything's all
right in there.

182
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:43,490
(horse neighing)

183
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:46,126
- Jenny!

184
00:13:52,634 --> 00:13:55,235
- Better check upstairs, Steve.

185
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:06,514
(wind howling)
(eerie music)

186
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:15,557
- Grandpa! Grandpa!

187
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:19,527
- Not now, sweetheart. Not now.

188
00:14:19,561 --> 00:14:22,963
- Grandpa, what's that funny
thing out behind the barn?

189
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:24,231
- I don't know. I don't know.

190
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:26,300
- Grandpa.

191
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:29,970
- Not now.
- It makes funny noises.

192
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,373
- Well, everything's all
right in the kitchen.

193
00:14:32,406 --> 00:14:35,610
Seems to me they only
hit one room, this one.

194
00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:36,578
Damn hoodlums.

195
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:40,582
- I don't know why they
did it, or who did it.

196
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:43,551
But you'd better
call the police.

197
00:14:43,585 --> 00:14:45,553
- Jenny, honey, what
are you talking about

198
00:14:45,587 --> 00:14:47,154
makes funny noises?

199
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:49,890
- Lots of lights and
stuff, and it plays music.

200
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,594
- Sweetheart, there's
nothing out there

201
00:14:52,627 --> 00:14:55,062
behind the barn
except the corral.

202
00:14:57,364 --> 00:15:00,535
- Hey, Dad. Everything
looks fine upstairs.

203
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:03,070
They must have heard somebody
or something and left.

204
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:05,038
- Dad, maybe we'd
better go check.

205
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:07,374
- Yeah. Let's go.

206
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:08,510
Atta girl. Let's go.

207
00:15:09,611 --> 00:15:12,647
- (sighs) Well, don't
just stand there.

208
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,914
Help me clean up.

209
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,388
(horse neighing)

210
00:15:22,557 --> 00:15:23,691
- I'll show you
just what I mean.

211
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:24,925
- Okay, sweetheart.

212
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:29,329
(eerie music)

213
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:39,741
(horse snorts)

214
00:15:39,774 --> 00:15:42,644
- Granddad, it was there
a little while ago.

215
00:15:42,677 --> 00:15:46,514
It really was.
- Oh?

216
00:15:46,548 --> 00:15:47,649
- All right, baby.

217
00:15:47,682 --> 00:15:50,317
Let's go in the house and
clean up that mess, okay?

218
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,454
- But Mommy, it was.
I promise it was.

219
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:55,255
- Hey, it was lights and stuff?

220
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:56,290
- Yes, Granddad.

221
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:58,959
- And music playing?
- Yes.

222
00:16:00,762 --> 00:16:01,629
- Come on, Jenny.

223
00:16:09,671 --> 00:16:12,473
(solemn music)

224
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:28,355
(artifact chiming)

225
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:47,575
Jenny, I won't tell you again.

226
00:16:48,743 --> 00:16:50,177
- I'm coming, Mommy.

227
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,350
(upbeat groovy music)

228
00:16:58,853 --> 00:17:00,655
- God, that's not good.

229
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:14,201
Does this look good to you?
- Yeah.

230
00:17:15,637 --> 00:17:18,773
- (laughs) You better run
in and wash up, sweetheart.

231
00:17:18,806 --> 00:17:20,775
Dinner is just about ready.

232
00:17:20,808 --> 00:17:21,643
- Okay, Grandpa.

233
00:17:32,587 --> 00:17:34,254
- Did you call the police?

234
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:35,657
- Yeah, I called them.

235
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:36,691
They said they'd be
over in the morning

236
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:37,825
to make a full report.

237
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:42,195
They also said to leave
everything just like it is.

238
00:17:49,704 --> 00:17:52,607
(mirror crackling)

239
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:01,816
(eerie music)

240
00:18:34,882 --> 00:18:36,684
- Thank you, water.

241
00:18:42,757 --> 00:18:44,358
Thank you, light.

242
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:50,197
Is that good, Grandpa?

243
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:52,432
- That's good, good.

244
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,836
Come on. Let's go eat, huh?

245
00:18:55,803 --> 00:18:58,906
You sit right there
on the end, okay?

246
00:19:00,508 --> 00:19:01,609
There you are.

247
00:19:02,944 --> 00:19:05,813
- Grandpa, this
is a funny house.

248
00:19:05,847 --> 00:19:08,281
- Oh?
- How do you mean, Jenny?

249
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:09,751
- It's the only house
that I've ever seen

250
00:19:09,784 --> 00:19:11,552
that works by itself.

251
00:19:11,586 --> 00:19:13,253
- What are you talking about?

252
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:16,490
- Well, I walked in
the bathroom, and
the lights went on.

253
00:19:16,524 --> 00:19:19,794
And I went to the sink, and
the water turned itself on.

254
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:21,829
- I think you're crazy.
- Yeah.

255
00:19:22,897 --> 00:19:24,264
- Fed the horses, huh?

256
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:25,465
- Sure did.
- Good boy.

257
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:27,635
- Fed yours too,
you little monster.

258
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:29,771
- It's nice to have a
man around the house.

259
00:19:29,804 --> 00:19:31,906
(all laugh)

260
00:19:31,939 --> 00:19:34,809
- Hey, excuse me, Momma.
There you are, Steve.

261
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:37,945
(insects chirping)

262
00:19:48,823 --> 00:19:49,857
Listen.

263
00:19:51,893 --> 00:19:54,261
- [Ana] I don't hear anything.

264
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:58,800
- You have to listen very,
very carefully, sweetheart.

265
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:02,503
- I'm completely tuned
in to the silence

266
00:20:03,771 --> 00:20:04,972
and turned on by it.

267
00:20:05,006 --> 00:20:06,841
Isn't that what you
wanted me to say?

268
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:11,846
- No traffic, no sirens, no
planes, no people, no nothing.

269
00:20:13,715 --> 00:20:16,483
(mysterious music)

270
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:18,853
- There's not a road
there, is there?

271
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:19,721
Or is there?

272
00:20:19,754 --> 00:20:22,255
- No, that's not the road.
- A jet?

273
00:20:23,024 --> 00:20:24,525
- It can't be.

274
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,394
(objects buzzing)

275
00:20:34,068 --> 00:20:36,403
Don't suppose a pair
of two motorcycles

276
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:38,539
can shoot right into
the air, can they?

277
00:20:38,573 --> 00:20:41,509
- No. No, you can't say that.

278
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,511
- My god, Ana.

279
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:46,013
We just saw a UFO.

280
00:20:47,815 --> 00:20:49,584
- I don't believe it.

281
00:20:49,617 --> 00:20:50,985
- Get back inside the house.

282
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,695
- Well, how long do you
think it'll take to fix it?

283
00:21:01,896 --> 00:21:03,564
Yeah. Okay. I'll call
back in an hour or so.

284
00:21:03,598 --> 00:21:04,565
Thank you.

285
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:07,668
(muffled rock music)

286
00:21:13,908 --> 00:21:18,012
- Hey. Why don't
you get on to bed?

287
00:21:18,045 --> 00:21:19,947
I think I'll have a glass
of milk and lock up.

288
00:21:19,981 --> 00:21:20,982
- All right.

289
00:21:28,923 --> 00:21:32,059
(mysterious music)

290
00:21:37,932 --> 00:21:38,933
Grant.
- Yes?

291
00:21:41,002 --> 00:21:42,036
- Come look at this.

292
00:21:43,037 --> 00:21:44,471
- I'll be right with you.

293
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,952
What is it?
- A mirror.

294
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,021
- Well, what about it?

295
00:22:00,054 --> 00:22:01,522
- It was broken.

296
00:22:04,058 --> 00:22:05,560
- By god, that's right.

297
00:22:05,593 --> 00:22:07,061
At least I think it was.

298
00:22:07,094 --> 00:22:07,895
- Well, we all saw it.

299
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:09,931
It was broken right
down the middle.

300
00:22:09,964 --> 00:22:11,431
- What the hell goes on?

301
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:14,001
- Grant.
- What?

302
00:22:14,035 --> 00:22:16,037
- Someone's in the kitchen.

303
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,438
- Oh.
- And look, it's green.

304
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:21,909
- I just left there.
There couldn't be.

305
00:22:21,943 --> 00:22:22,777
- Go see.

306
00:22:35,923 --> 00:22:37,758
- It seems to be okay.

307
00:22:42,997 --> 00:22:44,165
- You see?

308
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:46,000
It was just that
solar-powered thing.

309
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:48,435
- Well, I'll tell
you what I'll do.

310
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:50,037
I'll check it out
first thing tomorrow.

311
00:22:50,071 --> 00:22:51,539
Okay?
- All right.

312
00:22:54,108 --> 00:22:56,010
(soft string music)

313
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:56,911
Come on up.

314
00:23:34,882 --> 00:23:36,117
- I don't know what
the hell to do.

315
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,820
We just go to bed and
try to forget it, huh?

316
00:23:40,755 --> 00:23:41,923
Oh, god.

317
00:23:41,956 --> 00:23:44,792
Goodnight, sweetheart.
- Goodnight.

318
00:23:45,993 --> 00:23:49,096
- You know, other people
claim they've seen UFOs,

319
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:53,100
but I guess I never
did believe them.

320
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:00,775
Give me your hand, darling.

321
00:24:01,642 --> 00:24:04,145
(eerie music)

322
00:24:57,565 --> 00:25:00,500
(toilet flushes)

323
00:25:51,318 --> 00:25:54,755
(curious upbeat music)

324
00:25:58,192 --> 00:25:59,260
- You want to play?

325
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,670
(ominous music)

326
00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:50,811
(UFO buzzing)

327
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:15,970
(artifact chiming)

328
00:27:21,175 --> 00:27:23,677
(eerie music)

329
00:28:24,805 --> 00:28:27,007
- Grant, it's in the hallway!

330
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:29,043
- What's in the hallway?

331
00:28:35,517 --> 00:28:36,917
What could it be?

332
00:28:53,535 --> 00:28:54,301
- Dad.

333
00:28:54,335 --> 00:28:56,437
- Did you hear
anything out here?

334
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,072
- I thought I heard Mom yell.

335
00:28:58,105 --> 00:28:59,440
- She said she saw something.

336
00:28:59,473 --> 00:29:01,108
- Well, let's go check Jenny.

337
00:29:09,383 --> 00:29:11,018
She's gone.

338
00:29:11,051 --> 00:29:13,153
- What's happening?
- Jenny's gone!

339
00:29:13,187 --> 00:29:15,222
- No!
- My god, what's that?

340
00:29:15,256 --> 00:29:18,192
(foreboding music)

341
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:23,531
- Jenny!

342
00:29:27,468 --> 00:29:29,136
- What's wrong?
- Jenny's missing!

343
00:29:34,475 --> 00:29:36,443
- Jenny!
- Jenny!

344
00:29:36,477 --> 00:29:37,512
- Jenny! Jenny!

345
00:29:40,548 --> 00:29:42,116
Oh, my god!

346
00:29:42,149 --> 00:29:42,983
- Jenny!

347
00:29:44,418 --> 00:29:45,452
Jenny!

348
00:29:46,554 --> 00:29:49,790
(ground rumbling)

349
00:30:02,537 --> 00:30:05,239
(eerie music)

350
00:30:13,414 --> 00:30:16,183
(UFOs whizzing)

351
00:30:23,357 --> 00:30:25,259
They're back again, Grant.

352
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:26,994
- What are you
talking about, Mother?

353
00:30:27,027 --> 00:30:30,464
- Well, we saw them
earlier this evening.

354
00:30:31,398 --> 00:30:34,068
(door clacking)

355
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:46,413
- Oh, Jenny!

356
00:30:46,447 --> 00:30:49,350
- (sighs) My god, I
could have shot her.

357
00:30:49,383 --> 00:30:51,485
- Baby, where have you been?

358
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:53,521
- I was outside
playing with my friend.

359
00:30:53,555 --> 00:30:55,489
- [Beth] Your
friend? What friend?

360
00:30:55,523 --> 00:30:57,925
- That thing that made
the bad thing go away.

361
00:30:57,958 --> 00:30:59,393
- What bad thing, Jenny?

362
00:30:59,426 --> 00:31:01,596
- I thought it was a
telescope, but it wasn't.

363
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:04,632
It sort of long and
looked like Daddy's rifle.

364
00:31:04,666 --> 00:31:05,499
But-
- Oh, my god, Grant.

365
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:08,636
Could somebody be
out there with a gun?

366
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,070
- Could be.

367
00:31:10,104 --> 00:31:11,238
- Dad, I think we've
got to get out of here

368
00:31:11,271 --> 00:31:12,906
till the morning
when the police come.

369
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,475
- Where can we go
at one o'clock?

370
00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:16,877
- I don't care. I just
want to get out of here.

371
00:31:18,245 --> 00:31:20,314
- All right. You
two get dressed.

372
00:31:20,347 --> 00:31:21,949
I'll take a look around outside.

373
00:31:28,422 --> 00:31:29,624
- Be careful, Grant.

374
00:31:29,657 --> 00:31:30,991
- I will. You stay here.

with an update from
the US Weather Bureau.

383
00:34:05,713 --> 00:34:07,147
Those electrical disturbances

384
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,215
throughout the
deserts of Southern-

385
00:34:08,248 --> 00:34:09,483
- Yeah, hello, operator.

386
00:34:09,517 --> 00:34:11,819
I'm having trouble
reaching 343-4077.

387
00:34:11,853 --> 00:34:13,655
Can you check that
line for me, please?

And some communities

ground tremors.

Communication with
the stricken areas

has become increasingly
difficult tonight

392
00:34:20,828 --> 00:34:22,429
due to telephone blackouts

393
00:34:22,462 --> 00:34:24,832
and atmospheric
radio interference.

the freak weather conditions

now being felt on Earth.

a minute, will you?

- Yeah, Dad?

409
00:35:05,607 --> 00:35:07,775
- We're going back to town.
- What about the horses?

410
00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:09,744
- They'll be okay. We'll
be back in the morning.

411

- Are you sure we
even have to go?

412
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:12,346
- Sure do.

413
00:35:12,379 --> 00:35:14,181

414
00:35:14,214 --> 00:35:15,516
Go see if she and
Jenny are ready.

415
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,183
- Okay, Mom.

416
00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:18,853

- Just about.

00:35:31,431 --> 00:35:32,734

Honey, you stay here.
- Be careful.

I don't get this.

You just take it easy
now, circle over there,

428
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:08,836
and I'll circle
around here, okay?

429
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,170
- Yeah. All right.

430
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,542

Let's get out of here.

- No, no. Something's
going on out there.

- What do you mean?

434
00:36:17,879 --> 00:36:20,515
- Well, the car's running,
and nobody's in it.

440
00:37:00,287 --> 00:37:01,622
It doesn't make
any sense at all.

441

- Well, Jesus Christ.

442

See if you can jerk
that battery cable off.

446

- It does?

447
00:37:32,553 --> 00:37:36,557
Okay, car. I want you
to stop fooling around.

448

Grant?
- Richard?

Richard, can you hear me?

466
00:39:10,483 --> 00:39:12,452
Get out here as quick
as you can, you hear?

467
00:39:12,485 --> 00:39:14,622
- What the... Operator?

468
00:39:14,655 --> 00:39:17,058
Listen, all I got
was interference.

469
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:23,030

Can't we get out of here?

476
00:40:19,921 --> 00:40:22,890
- I think so, Grant, while
we've got the chance.

477
00:40:22,924 --> 00:40:24,659
- Okay, first thing
we're going to have to do

478
00:40:24,692 --> 00:40:26,193
is find out if the car will run.

479
00:40:26,227 --> 00:40:28,129
- Well, you have the keys?
- I left them in the car.

480

- I don't know what it was.

Can't you hook up some kind
of siphon or something?

pump someplace around here.

- Well, I'll tell
you what I'll do.

525

I'll go downstairs right
now and get it for you.

- Sure.

a sound for an hour.

take a look in.

532
00:46:01,529 --> 00:46:02,329
- It's at the bottom
of the stairs.

533
00:46:02,363 --> 00:46:04,431
I'll run down and
then right back up.

00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,292
Look at this.

538
00:47:06,327 --> 00:47:08,462
- Wow! Look at those lights!

539
00:47:09,564 --> 00:47:12,433
(UFOs whizzing)

540
00:47:30,918 --> 00:47:33,420
(tense music)

541
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:46,333
- Grant!
- Huh?

542
00:47:46,367 --> 00:47:47,535
- It's Steven!

543
00:47:50,037 --> 00:47:51,472
- Good god!

544
00:47:51,506 --> 00:47:53,006
I'm coming, Steve!

545
00:47:56,143 --> 00:47:58,312
Shove that dresser in front
of the door after I leave.

546
00:47:58,345 --> 00:48:00,648
(tense music)

547
00:48:09,657 --> 00:48:12,660
(suspenseful music)

548
00:48:44,626 --> 00:48:47,127

551
00:49:41,148 --> 00:49:44,084
(monsters roaring)

552
00:50:10,344 --> 00:50:12,312
- Do you see anything?

553
00:50:12,346 --> 00:50:15,717
- Something coming from
the side of the house.

554
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:16,651
I'd better go downstairs.

555
00:50:16,684 --> 00:50:18,620
Grant will need help.

556
00:50:19,687 --> 00:50:22,991
(monsters roaring)

557
00:50:48,683 --> 00:50:51,653
- Hey! Get back in
the house. Hurry!

558
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:56,223
(monsters roaring)

559
00:51:13,307 --> 00:51:16,209
(monster growling)

560
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:32,760
- Dad, the stables.
- Yeah.

561
00:51:36,564 --> 00:51:39,399
(monster roaring)

562
00:51:42,269 --> 00:51:43,270
Let's hurry.

563
00:51:57,652 --> 00:51:59,119
Turn on the light.

564
00:52:02,857 --> 00:52:03,825
Come on.

565
00:52:03,858 --> 00:52:05,492
Come out of here.

566
00:52:11,899 --> 00:52:14,669
- You're going into
the desert, huh?

567
00:52:14,702 --> 00:52:15,737
- Yeah, that's right.

568
00:52:16,904 --> 00:52:18,906
- Watch out for
those power lines.

569
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:21,274
They're down and all over hill.

570
00:52:23,511 --> 00:52:25,847
- Okay. That's about it.
- Give me.

571
00:52:27,582 --> 00:52:29,249
That's about 12 gallons.

572
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:32,720
At $0.65, that'll be...

573
00:52:34,922 --> 00:52:36,691
- That'll be $7.80.

574
00:52:36,724 --> 00:52:39,292
Here. Keep the change.
- That's right.

575
00:52:39,326 --> 00:52:40,494
Hey, thanks a lot.

576
00:52:40,528 --> 00:52:41,361
- Thank you.

577
00:53:00,815 --> 00:53:01,616
- Well there doesn't seem

578
00:53:01,649 --> 00:53:03,584
to be anything out
there right now.

579
00:53:03,618 --> 00:53:06,186
- Can't you see any
sign of Steven or Dad?

580
00:53:06,921 --> 00:53:09,824
(knocking on door)

581
00:53:09,857 --> 00:53:11,926
- That might be them now.

582
00:53:18,866 --> 00:53:22,603
(Ana gasps)
(monster roaring)

583
00:53:22,637 --> 00:53:27,642
(Ana screaming)
(monster roaring)

584
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,381
- I better check at the
house. You stay put here.

585
00:53:34,414 --> 00:53:35,817
- Maybe I better come too.
- You watch the horses.

586
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:37,284
We lose them, we'll
never get out of here.

587
00:53:37,317 --> 00:53:39,854
- Dad! Here, take
this just in case.

588
00:53:47,028 --> 00:53:52,232
(monster roaring)
(foreboding music)

589
00:54:04,078 --> 00:54:06,914
(monster roaring)

590
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,863
- [Reporter on Radio] Again,
a big triple supernova

591
00:54:21,896 --> 00:54:23,765
recorded earlier this morning.

592
00:54:23,798 --> 00:54:25,666
Already the debate has begun

593
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,068
as to whether the
event was indeed

594
00:54:27,101 --> 00:54:30,738
an explosion of three
stars or a totally new,

595
00:54:30,772 --> 00:54:32,607
unrecorded stellar phenomena.

596
00:54:43,751 --> 00:54:46,587

597
00:55:08,743 --> 00:55:11,579

(monster growling)

599
00:55:22,123 --> 00:55:23,991
- Quick, Steve. Bring
up one of the horses.

600
00:55:24,025 --> 00:55:25,993
We've got to divert
that son of a bitch.

601
00:55:26,027 --> 00:55:27,394
- But Dad-
- It's the only way.

602
00:55:27,427 --> 00:55:28,763
It's the horse or us. Move!

603
00:55:36,804 --> 00:55:39,640
(monster roaring)

604
00:55:45,947 --> 00:55:47,915
Get back down there and
make all the noise you can.

605
00:55:47,949 --> 00:55:50,017
Help divert them. Go ahead.

606
00:55:57,158 --> 00:55:58,092
- Hey, you!

607
00:55:58,926 --> 00:56:01,696
(monster roaring)

608
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,075
Now, Dad!

609
00:56:16,043 --> 00:56:21,048
- Hyah! Hah!
(tense music)

610
00:56:24,085 --> 00:56:26,921

(wind howling)

615
00:57:25,212 --> 00:57:26,714
- [Reporter on Radio]
Communications have been cut off

616
00:57:26,747 --> 00:57:27,682
for most of the evening.

617
00:57:27,715 --> 00:57:29,050
Puzzling information is starting

618
00:57:29,083 --> 00:57:31,484
to trickle in from storms...

619
00:57:32,653 --> 00:57:34,789
In the wake of severe
electrical disturbances

620
00:57:34,822 --> 00:57:37,024
and unusual seismic activity.

621
00:57:37,058 --> 00:57:39,627

(wind howling)

630
00:59:43,918 --> 00:59:45,219
Anybody out there?

631
01:00:30,331 --> 01:00:32,199
Hello, hello, hello?

632
01:00:58,792 --> 01:01:01,362

Jenny!

636
01:02:33,487 --> 01:02:34,321
Jenny!

01:02:37,324 --> 01:02:40,094
(statue chiming)

638
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:44,465
Run!

639
01:02:47,134 --> 01:02:49,537
Hurry!
- Grandpa, wait for me!

640
01:02:51,071 --> 01:02:53,407
Grandpa, wait for me!

641
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,775
Wait, Grandpa!

642
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:57,177
- Run, Jenny! Run!

643
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,781
- Wait, Grandpa!

644
01:03:11,225 --> 01:03:13,160
- Come on, Jenny! Run!

645
01:03:20,434 --> 01:03:21,435
- Jenny, no!

646
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:27,441
Jenny!

647
01:03:30,612 --> 01:03:31,445
Jenny!

648
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,249
- Jenny!
- No, Jenny!

649
01:03:37,951 --> 01:03:38,586
Jenny!

650
01:04:09,483 --> 01:04:12,853
(solemn string music)

651
01:04:16,658 --> 01:04:18,626
- Easy now, son. Easy now.

652
01:04:19,493 --> 01:04:21,161
That's a good boy. There you go.

653
01:04:21,195 --> 01:04:23,197
Take it easy. That's it.

654
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:30,505
That's it. What are you
doing out here, huh?

655
01:04:30,538 --> 01:04:32,507
Where is everybody?

656
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:33,508
You all right?

657
01:04:34,642 --> 01:04:36,343
That's a good boy.

658
01:04:39,514 --> 01:04:41,014
That's a good boy.

659
01:05:05,339 --> 01:05:08,175
(horses neighing)

660
01:05:16,618 --> 01:05:17,985
- Are you okay, Son?

661
01:05:18,018 --> 01:05:19,153
- Sure, I'm okay.

662
01:05:20,287 --> 01:05:21,388
You were going to
check up at the house.

663
01:05:21,422 --> 01:05:22,524
What's Mom doing here?

664
01:05:23,725 --> 01:05:25,492
- Check up at the
house? What do you mean?

665
01:05:25,527 --> 01:05:26,661
- That's what you said
you were going to do

666
01:05:26,694 --> 01:05:27,629
just a few seconds ago.

667
01:05:27,662 --> 01:05:30,565
And why is it light outside?

668
01:05:30,598 --> 01:05:33,601
- Son, I left hours ago.

669
01:05:34,669 --> 01:05:36,671
- Hours? Dad, you just left me.

670
01:05:36,704 --> 01:05:37,705
You hardly closed the door,

671
01:05:37,739 --> 01:05:39,173
and you were right back here.

672
01:05:41,475 --> 01:05:43,578
- Steve, you know what
this is, don't you?

673
01:05:46,681 --> 01:05:48,616
It's a time-space warp.

674
01:05:50,585 --> 01:05:53,220
- I'm not sure I know
exactly what that is.

675
01:05:53,253 --> 01:05:55,222
- I don't suppose
anybody really does.

676
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:58,425
We've seen some
strange things tonight,

677
01:05:59,661 --> 01:06:02,963
strange creatures that we know
don't belong on our planet.

678
01:06:03,731 --> 01:06:06,266
God only knows where
they came from.

679
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:07,602
- Jenny and Beth...

680
01:06:09,737 --> 01:06:11,104
- The vortex took them.

681
01:06:14,609 --> 01:06:15,643
Just took them away.

682
01:06:19,346 --> 01:06:21,315
I don't know what
place they're in.

683
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:28,055
I don't even know
what time they're in.

684
01:06:29,223 --> 01:06:30,991
I don't even know
what time we're in.

685
01:06:36,564 --> 01:06:38,633
- What are we gonna do
about Beth and Jenny?

686
01:06:38,666 --> 01:06:41,034
- What are we gonna
do about any of us?

687
01:06:41,068 --> 01:06:43,571
- We go on. That's what we do.

688
01:06:54,248 --> 01:06:59,253
(wind howling)
(lights chiming)

689
01:07:13,735 --> 01:07:14,769
- Look!

690
01:07:16,804 --> 01:07:19,807
(suspenseful music)

691
01:07:34,789 --> 01:07:39,794
(wind howling)
(lights chiming)

692
01:08:14,729 --> 01:08:17,497
(solemn music)

693
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:23,805
- Grant.

694
01:08:27,809 --> 01:08:28,843
Grant.

695
01:08:31,411 --> 01:08:32,847
Do you know where we're going?

696
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:18,425
(wind howling)
(lights chiming)

697
01:09:58,866 --> 01:10:01,869
(soft string music)

698
01:10:24,525 --> 01:10:26,928
(wind howling)

699
01:10:32,567 --> 01:10:34,802
- Momma, Momma, wake up.
- Huh?

700
01:10:36,771 --> 01:10:37,605
- Look.

701
01:10:38,906 --> 01:10:39,974
- Oh, my god.

702
01:10:53,855 --> 01:10:56,991
(moving string music)

703
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,777
(statue chiming)

704
01:11:39,066 --> 01:11:41,536
Oh, Beth. You're all right.

705
01:11:42,804 --> 01:11:44,437
Where's Jenny?

706
01:11:44,471 --> 01:11:47,307
- Jenny is fine.
She's with Richard.

707
01:11:56,017 --> 01:11:58,351
- Beth, what is it?

708
01:11:58,385 --> 01:11:59,419
- It's all right.

709
01:11:59,452 --> 01:12:01,421
Everything's going to be fine.

710
01:12:01,454 --> 01:12:03,124
We're going to be safe.

711
01:12:03,157 --> 01:12:04,457
I know where to go.

712
01:12:15,703 --> 01:12:17,839
I'm not sure I can explain it.

713
01:12:17,872 --> 01:12:19,740
It's only a feeling I have.

714
01:12:20,975 --> 01:12:25,980
I felt a communication,
a series of images,

715
01:12:27,114 --> 01:12:29,984
after which I knew what
was happening to us.

716
01:12:30,017 --> 01:12:33,054
And I knew our fear
was unnecessary.

717
01:12:33,087 --> 01:12:35,122
- But how can you
be sure that they,

718
01:12:35,156 --> 01:12:37,490
it, or whatever, is
telling the truth?

719
01:12:37,525 --> 01:12:40,027
- Oh, I don't think it
knew what deception was.

720
01:12:40,061 --> 01:12:41,963
It goes beyond those things,

721
01:12:41,996 --> 01:12:44,532
millions of years beyond.

722
01:12:44,565 --> 01:12:47,068
And yet there is a
feeling there of a warmth.

723
01:12:48,435 --> 01:12:51,438
These are life forms
evolved past anything

724
01:12:51,471 --> 01:12:54,041
our imaginations are
capable of perceiving now.

725
01:12:56,143 --> 01:12:58,579
- What's gonna happen
to us now, Beth?

726
01:12:58,613 --> 01:13:01,082
- I don't understand
it completely, Dad.

727
01:13:01,115 --> 01:13:03,851
For a while the whole galaxy
was turned upside down.

728
01:13:05,052 --> 01:13:07,121
- Are we ever going
to see Jenny again?

729
01:13:07,154 --> 01:13:09,824
- Oh, yes, of course.

730
01:13:09,857 --> 01:13:11,058
She's waiting for us.

731
01:13:12,793 --> 01:13:15,763
- Beth, you think we'll
ever get back home?

732
01:13:15,796 --> 01:13:16,731
- I don't know.

733
01:13:19,634 --> 01:13:21,802
- Hey, you guys! Hurry up!

734
01:13:22,837 --> 01:13:27,842
- Jenny!
(Grant laughing)

735
01:13:32,146 --> 01:13:34,048
- Jenny! We thought
we'd lost you.

736
01:13:34,081 --> 01:13:35,182
- Are you all right, sweetheart?

737
01:13:35,216 --> 01:13:36,150
- Sure, Grandpa.

738
01:13:36,183 --> 01:13:37,618
Look! There's Daddy!

739
01:13:37,652 --> 01:13:39,419
- Oh! Hey, Richard!

740
01:13:41,155 --> 01:13:43,124
- Oh, Jenny. Guess
what I got for you?

741
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:47,194
- Thanks, Steve.

742
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:49,931
- Come on.

743
01:13:49,964 --> 01:13:53,134
(moving string music)

744
01:14:11,852 --> 01:14:14,522
(Beth laughing)

745
01:14:17,692 --> 01:14:19,694
- Hey, boy, how are you?

746
01:14:44,585 --> 01:14:47,254
(UFOs whizzing)

747
01:15:04,105 --> 01:15:05,539
- It's beautiful.

748
01:15:34,335 --> 01:15:37,738
- Well, you know something?
- What?

749
01:15:37,772 --> 01:15:39,640
- Maybe this was
all meant to be.

750
01:15:42,109 --> 01:15:44,211
This is our new way of life.

751
01:15:44,245 --> 01:15:47,615
(inspirational music)

752
01:16:17,011 --> 01:16:19,947
{\an7}(mysterious music)

753
01:17:20,341 --> 01:17:23,310
(dramatic music)
