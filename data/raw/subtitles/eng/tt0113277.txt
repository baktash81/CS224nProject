1
00:00:03,249 --> 00:00:04,580
What did you do?

2
00:00:04,984 --> 00:00:05,951
That was you?

3
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:08,248
I don't sell metal.

4
00:00:09,122 --> 00:00:12,114
Would have been okay, you fly out after.
Now it's jammed.

5
00:00:12,292 --> 00:00:13,884
We gotta go together.

6
00:00:14,327 --> 00:00:16,420
Those other people were with you?

7
00:00:18,231 --> 00:00:19,823
My friend, Michael...

8
00:00:21,534 --> 00:00:23,058
...he knew the risks.

9
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:30,066
When it rains, you get wet.

10
00:00:32,846 --> 00:00:34,108
Get packed.

11
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,195
Why did you do this to me?

12
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,779
It'll be all right.

13
00:01:08,848 --> 00:01:10,440
Do you understand?

14
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:17,218
It's going to be all right.

15
00:01:28,668 --> 00:01:31,831
There's a Camaro at this address,
Level D, Slot 18.

16
00:01:37,076 --> 00:01:38,543
Here's some cash.

17
00:01:41,548 --> 00:01:42,845
When is it over?

18
00:01:46,252 --> 00:01:47,947
Twenty-two hours from now.

19
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:51,951
-Then we get out of here clean.
-When will you let me leave?

20
00:01:55,895 --> 00:01:56,953
Go now.

21
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,021
You want out? There's the door.

22
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,590
Will you let me leave later?

23
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:08,297
It will be different.

24
00:02:09,943 --> 00:02:11,706
Do you even understand?

25
00:02:42,642 --> 00:02:44,007
It's ready.

26
00:02:51,718 --> 00:02:53,549
This is my friend Ralph.

27
00:02:54,153 --> 00:02:56,144
You didn't tell me you were--

28
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,355
Oh, my God!

29
00:02:58,524 --> 00:02:59,786
Where's Lauren?

30
00:03:00,126 --> 00:03:01,923
She's at Lisa-Beth's.

31
00:03:02,562 --> 00:03:04,462
This has nothing to do with me. I'm sorry.

32
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,758
What are you sorry about?

33
00:03:05,832 --> 00:03:06,992
Sit down.

34
00:03:07,634 --> 00:03:09,033
Don't you even get angry?

35
00:03:10,236 --> 00:03:11,328
I'm angry.

36
00:03:13,072 --> 00:03:14,937
I'm very angry, Ralph.

37
00:03:15,508 --> 00:03:18,306
You can ball my wife if she wants you to.

38
00:03:20,146 --> 00:03:22,842
You can lounge around here on her sofa.

39
00:03:24,651 --> 00:03:26,516
In her ex-husband's...

40
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,080
...dead-tech, post-modernistic,
bullshit house...

41
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:31,555
...if you want to.

42
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:36,157
But you do not get to watch...

43
00:03:36,863 --> 00:03:38,421
...my fucking...

44
00:03:38,965 --> 00:03:40,193
...television set!

45
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:41,631
For God's sake.

46
00:03:48,474 --> 00:03:50,305
Put the television set down.

47
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,038
-I never cheated on you, bitch.
-Maybe you should have.

48
00:03:53,112 --> 00:03:55,273
-I should have?
-You're a party to this.

49
00:03:55,348 --> 00:03:58,579
I made Ralph fuck you
because it makes me feel good.

50
00:03:58,651 --> 00:04:00,312
Our situation is absurd.

51
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:04,914
Shut up, Ralph! Sit down!

52
00:04:08,594 --> 00:04:12,496
Why is it that I have to figure things out
and explain them to you?

53
00:04:12,665 --> 00:04:14,997
I say what I mean, and I do what I say.

54
00:04:15,535 --> 00:04:16,627
How admirable.

55
00:04:16,703 --> 00:04:19,001
-You bet.
-Except none of it's about us.

56
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,606
No.

57
00:04:22,075 --> 00:04:24,908
I may be stoned on grass and Prozac but...

58
00:04:25,878 --> 00:04:28,005
...you walk through our life dead.

59
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:32,811
Now I have to demean myself with Ralph
just to get closure with you.

60
00:04:45,832 --> 00:04:48,232
Passports, traveler's checks, plastic.

61
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:49,997
The plane...

62
00:04:50,403 --> 00:04:53,429
...charter terminal, LAX, Hangar 1 7.

63
00:04:53,706 --> 00:04:55,606
Call letters are 101 1 Sierra.

64
00:04:58,878 --> 00:05:00,072
Touches down...

65
00:05:00,146 --> 00:05:02,706
...holds for you five minutes, then splits.

66
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:06,476
The plane will stand an FAA check.
Filed a flight plan, the works.

67
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:09,113
Where's Chris?

68
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:10,747
He's gone.

69
00:05:12,158 --> 00:05:13,125
What?

70
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,260
Said he's going on his own.
Went to find Charlene.

71
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:18,627
-Did you bring him here?
-Yeah, I did.

72
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:20,657
What happened?

73
00:05:21,768 --> 00:05:23,326
It's a free country.

74
00:05:28,574 --> 00:05:30,405
Check in with me at 9:00...

75
00:05:30,777 --> 00:05:32,574
...everything is still cool.

76
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,440
All right.

77
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:01,137
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

78
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,207
I know life is short.

79
00:06:06,846 --> 00:06:08,939
Whatever time you get is luck.

80
00:06:11,651 --> 00:06:13,209
You want to walk?

81
00:06:16,055 --> 00:06:17,852
You walk right now...

82
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:21,051
...all on your own.

83
00:06:21,727 --> 00:06:24,389
On your own you choose to come with me.

84
00:06:30,803 --> 00:06:32,395
All I know is...

85
00:06:34,674 --> 00:06:37,939
...there's no point in me
going anywhere anymore...

86
00:06:39,512 --> 00:06:41,503
...if it's going to be alone...

87
00:06:42,548 --> 00:06:44,072
...without you.

88
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,168
I got a live one.

89
00:07:46,145 --> 00:07:47,305
I'll hold.

90
00:07:50,016 --> 00:07:51,483
Show yourself.

91
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:54,177
-Do it.
-Shut up!

92
00:07:58,524 --> 00:08:00,754
Now, just one second at the window...

93
00:08:01,994 --> 00:08:03,791
...and it's all over.

94
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:54,865
Hey, man...

95
00:09:57,143 --> 00:09:59,805
...you know any place to rent around here?

96
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:18,754
It's not him.

97
00:10:18,831 --> 00:10:20,196
It's not Chris.

98
00:10:28,341 --> 00:10:30,036
Unit 2, this is Command.

99
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:31,840
Take him at the street.

100
00:10:31,977 --> 00:10:33,205
Check him out.

101
00:11:00,806 --> 00:11:02,273
He's John Peterson.

102
00:11:02,341 --> 00:11:04,741
Valid ID. Car's registered to...

103
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,571
...Bukowski, Gene.

104
00:11:07,213 --> 00:11:08,373
Ran it to DMV.

105
00:11:08,447 --> 00:11:09,744
It's clean.

106
00:11:12,718 --> 00:11:13,810
Let him go.

107
00:11:14,387 --> 00:11:15,479
Roger.

108
00:11:15,755 --> 00:11:17,746
Thank you. Have a good evening.

109
00:11:19,725 --> 00:11:20,589
It's no-go.

110
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,803
Would you like a cup of coffee
while we wait?

111
00:11:33,906 --> 00:11:35,635
Yeah, that would be nice.

112
00:12:06,772 --> 00:12:08,137
What do you got?

113
00:12:08,207 --> 00:12:09,674
Nothing's happening.

114
00:12:22,888 --> 00:12:24,355
Hello, it's Vincent.

115
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,082
What do you got?

116
00:12:26,158 --> 00:12:28,388
Nothing's going on. Waingro went for ice.

117
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:30,053
That's it.

118
00:12:38,838 --> 00:12:40,169
You know what?

119
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,175
Neil is gone.

120
00:12:49,248 --> 00:12:50,840
Flying like a bird.

121
00:12:51,383 --> 00:12:52,714
How do you know?

122
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,752
We still got bait!

123
00:12:55,821 --> 00:12:57,914
-Maybe some time!
-What do we got?

124
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,421
What do we got?

125
00:13:00,326 --> 00:13:02,317
Bon voyage, motherfucker.

126
00:13:03,762 --> 00:13:05,229
You were good.

127
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:08,727
I'm going to the hotel.

128
00:13:10,002 --> 00:13:11,993
I'm going to take a shower...

129
00:13:12,972 --> 00:13:15,406
...and I'm going to sleep for a month.

130
00:15:26,705 --> 00:15:27,797
Here.

131
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,847
Come on.

132
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,682
Shit.

133
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:56,696
Motherfucking waste.

134
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:02,972
Assholes shoot themselves all fucking day.

135
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:04,304
Not you, baby.

136
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,638
Not you.

137
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:13,679
Where would she be? Her name is Lauren.

138
00:16:13,852 --> 00:16:16,685
Lauren Gustafson,
and she's supposed to be here.

139
00:16:24,229 --> 00:16:26,322
I need somebody to help....

140
00:16:32,471 --> 00:16:33,529
I got you.

141
00:16:34,907 --> 00:16:38,001
You'll be all right, I swear. It's okay, baby.

142
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,068
Let's get a doctor!

143
00:16:40,145 --> 00:16:41,908
Let's go! A doctor here!

144
00:16:42,214 --> 00:16:44,648
-There's your mama.
-Let's just calm down.

145
00:16:44,683 --> 00:16:46,844
-Is she on any drugs?
-I'm calm. No.

146
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:52,012
Get a trauma surgeon
and a vascular surgeon.

147
00:16:52,257 --> 00:16:55,749
I think she cut both arteries.
I could hardly feel her pulse.

148
00:16:56,095 --> 00:16:57,460
Her pressure's down.

149
00:16:57,529 --> 00:16:59,394
So is the respiration.
You have to intubate her.

150
00:16:59,465 --> 00:17:00,727
It's ready.

151
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:04,626
When's the last time anybody saw her?

152
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:05,863
I don't know.

153
00:17:05,938 --> 00:17:07,337
Where did you find her?

154
00:17:07,406 --> 00:17:08,566
The bathtub.

155
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:12,636
Give her large-bore normal saline.

156
00:17:12,911 --> 00:17:14,378
Keep pressure on those bleeders.

157
00:17:14,446 --> 00:17:17,813
Give me two units, O-negative.
Let's type and cross her for six.

158
00:17:19,785 --> 00:17:23,186
Where is respiratory? We need more help.
Get them down now.

159
00:17:23,222 --> 00:17:26,248
Let's have X-ray ready
for post-intubation chest X-ray.

160
00:17:32,765 --> 00:17:35,791
Your daughter's out of surgery
and she's in the recovery room.

161
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:37,392
Her vital signs are stable.

162
00:17:37,469 --> 00:17:40,131
The surgeon will speak to you
in a few moments.

163
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:41,206
She's okay?

164
00:17:41,306 --> 00:17:42,432
She's doing good.

165
00:17:42,508 --> 00:17:44,032
She'll be okay.

166
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,410
She's going to be okay.

167
00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:49,513
Oh, my baby.
Why did she do this to herself?

168
00:17:50,949 --> 00:17:54,043
Look what she did.
Look what she did to herself.

169
00:17:58,423 --> 00:18:01,119
It's all right. It's going to be all right.

170
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:03,654
I'm here. I ain't going anywhere.

171
00:18:03,729 --> 00:18:06,527
Do you understand?
I ain't going anywhere.

172
00:18:21,446 --> 00:18:22,413
It's me.

173
00:18:23,048 --> 00:18:25,812
Plane's in the air now.
You're right on time.

174
00:18:26,418 --> 00:18:28,352
I still can't find a driver...

175
00:18:28,453 --> 00:18:30,182
...so that's in the trust.

176
00:18:30,556 --> 00:18:31,955
One other thing...

177
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,516
...I gotta tell you.

178
00:18:35,294 --> 00:18:39,321
The guy you want is in the Marquis
under Jamieson, if you still give a shit...

179
00:18:39,698 --> 00:18:41,495
...which I figure you wouldn't.

180
00:18:41,733 --> 00:18:43,132
You figured right.

181
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:45,161
So, so long, brother.

182
00:18:47,372 --> 00:18:48,839
You take it easy.

183
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:50,872
You're home free.

184
00:18:52,911 --> 00:18:54,173
Take it easy.

185
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,282
What is it?

186
00:19:06,592 --> 00:19:07,786
Nothing.

187
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:09,355
Home free.

188
00:19:47,499 --> 00:19:49,433
I gotta take care of something.

189
00:19:49,534 --> 00:19:50,694
Is there time?

190
00:19:51,503 --> 00:19:52,731
There's time.

191
00:20:21,633 --> 00:20:24,295
I'll be right back. Just leave her running.

192
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:07,375
Registration.

193
00:21:07,446 --> 00:21:08,708
This is room service.

194
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,739
A Jamieson ordered a BLT, and they
screwed up his room number. What is it?

195
00:21:12,818 --> 00:21:14,649
- They're always doing that.
-I know.

196
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,982
1735.

197
00:21:16,254 --> 00:21:17,516
Thank you.

198
00:23:01,326 --> 00:23:03,055
Your attention, please.

199
00:23:03,128 --> 00:23:05,494
We are currently experiencing a fire alarm.

200
00:23:06,765 --> 00:23:08,232
Do not panic.

201
00:23:08,433 --> 00:23:10,264
Do not take the elevators.

202
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,666
I'm staying here.

203
00:23:16,741 --> 00:23:20,108
I'll check the stairs.
If there's smoke, I'll pull you out.

204
00:23:24,749 --> 00:23:27,115
What about her dad? Should I call him?

205
00:23:28,153 --> 00:23:30,383
He's somewhere in the Sierras.

206
00:23:32,424 --> 00:23:34,085
And she chose you.

207
00:23:36,695 --> 00:23:38,526
She picked your place.

208
00:23:40,699 --> 00:23:42,690
It's not right, what happened to her.

209
00:23:42,767 --> 00:23:43,961
No, it's not.

210
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:02,382
Is there any way that...

211
00:24:04,723 --> 00:24:06,782
...it could work out between us?

212
00:24:09,594 --> 00:24:11,994
I wish I could say yes, you know.

213
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,388
But...

214
00:24:13,565 --> 00:24:15,157
...in the end....

215
00:24:20,071 --> 00:24:21,800
It's like you said:

216
00:24:24,943 --> 00:24:26,308
All I am...

217
00:24:27,012 --> 00:24:29,105
...is what I'm going after.

218
00:24:36,488 --> 00:24:38,718
I'm not what you want, Justine.

219
00:24:49,801 --> 00:24:51,359
Go on, if you have to.

220
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:55,699
I'll stay.

221
00:24:55,774 --> 00:24:57,674
I'm okay. I can handle this.

222
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:02,346
Just be careful.

223
00:25:03,114 --> 00:25:05,776
Call me here. Let me know you're okay.

224
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:07,852
Okay?

225
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,545
Security. There's a fire on three.

226
00:26:11,016 --> 00:26:12,813
We have to evacuate all floors.

227
00:26:12,884 --> 00:26:14,351
I can't leave here.

228
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:26,455
Why don't we just talk
about this a bit, brother?

229
00:26:40,712 --> 00:26:42,043
He's here on 1 7.

230
00:26:45,016 --> 00:26:46,244
Look at me.

231
00:26:46,384 --> 00:26:47,476
Look at me!

232
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:51,881
Look at me!

233
00:27:23,822 --> 00:27:25,289
LAPD! Don't move!

234
00:27:25,357 --> 00:27:27,188
Put your hands on your head!

235
00:28:02,694 --> 00:28:04,389
Switch me to TAC 5.

236
00:28:05,163 --> 00:28:06,425
Casals....

237
00:28:06,731 --> 00:28:07,663
JJ....

238
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,762
Drucker, JJ....

239
00:28:09,934 --> 00:28:12,334
I'm in the lobby level by the stairwell.

240
00:28:12,404 --> 00:28:13,530
What have you got?

241
00:28:13,638 --> 00:28:16,801
Teams are moving up the other elevators
to the 17th-floor elevators.

242
00:28:16,841 --> 00:28:20,277
All out of commission because
of the fire alarm. People everywhere.

243
00:28:20,378 --> 00:28:21,777
Fine. 10-4.

244
00:30:46,758 --> 00:30:48,316
Let me have that shot.

245
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,631
Told you I'm never going back.

246
00:37:12,743 --> 00:37:13,835
Yeah.
