Big finish! That'll do!
That'll do!

17
00:02:30,881 --> 00:02:32,446
Please!

18
00:02:32,448 --> 00:02:33,647
I sounded incredible!

19
00:02:33,649 --> 00:02:35,016
Tiggers are excellent singers.

20
00:02:35,018 --> 00:02:36,617
It's lovely having you all here.

21
00:02:36,619 --> 00:02:38,619
Always very moving, that number.

22
00:02:38,621 --> 00:02:41,122
Now, um, we all know
why we're here.

23
00:02:41,124 --> 00:02:43,957
It's a sad day.

24
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:46,927
But I have asked my
friend, Eeyore...

25
00:02:46,929 --> 00:02:49,164
That's me.

26
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:52,833
I have asked him to
propose a rissolution.

27
00:02:52,835 --> 00:02:54,968
Uh, it's "resolution."
Yes, that's what I said.

28
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,036
What's a "rissolution?"

29
00:02:56,038 --> 00:02:57,105
After the poem, dear.

30
00:02:58,507 --> 00:03:01,676
"Christopher Robin is going."

31
00:03:01,678 --> 00:03:05,446
"At least I think he is."

32
00:03:05,448 --> 00:03:08,048
"Where? Nobody knows."

33
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,819
"But he is going."

34
00:03:10,821 --> 00:03:13,855
I mean, he goes.

35
00:03:13,857 --> 00:03:18,629
"Do we care? We do. Very much."

36
00:03:19,662 --> 00:03:23,865
"Anyhow, we send our love."

37
00:03:23,867 --> 00:03:25,732
"End."

38
00:03:25,734 --> 00:03:29,636
If anyone wants to clap,
now is the time to do it.

39
00:03:29,638 --> 00:03:31,039
- Yay!
- Wonderful!

40
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,773
Christopher.

41
00:03:32,775 --> 00:03:34,242
There he is! He's here!

42
00:03:34,244 --> 00:03:36,010
That was a lovely poem, Eeyore.

43
00:03:36,012 --> 00:03:37,244
It was nothing.

44
00:03:37,246 --> 00:03:38,779
Oh, sorry.

45
00:03:38,781 --> 00:03:40,782
It's just too bad it's over.

46
00:03:40,784 --> 00:03:44,986
I would've liked it to go
on for a while longer.

47
00:03:44,988 --> 00:03:46,521
Now, now, let's not

48
00:03:46,523 --> 00:03:47,689
get carried away
there, Pooh Bear.

49
00:03:47,691 --> 00:03:49,157
That was plenty long enough.

50
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:51,024
For let's all remember,
I commissioned it.

51
00:03:51,026 --> 00:03:53,228
Based on an original idea by me.

52
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,595
Which I suggested.

53
00:03:54,597 --> 00:03:56,196
After I thought of it.

54
00:03:56,198 --> 00:03:57,665
Let's not do this in
public, shall we?

55
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:58,999
You wide-eyed nincompoop.

56
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:00,835
Christopher Robin,
I made you this

57
00:04:00,837 --> 00:04:02,197
sack of Hundred
Acre Wood haycorns.

58
00:04:03,173 --> 00:04:04,973
They're my very favorite snack.

59
00:04:04,975 --> 00:04:06,741
Wherever you may go,

60
00:04:06,743 --> 00:04:08,575
they'll remind you of
the Hundred Acre Wood.

61
00:04:08,577 --> 00:04:09,944
Thank you, Piglet.

62
00:04:09,946 --> 00:04:10,979
I don't think I'll need any help

63
00:04:10,981 --> 00:04:12,112
remembering the Wood...

64
00:04:12,114 --> 00:04:13,848
but I shall treasure them.

65
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,516
I'm gonna miss you, I am!

66
00:04:15,518 --> 00:04:17,151
I'm gonna miss you too, Tigger.

67
00:04:17,153 --> 00:04:19,854
Now, don't you go and get
all growned up on us!

68
00:04:19,856 --> 00:04:23,024
Uh, we shall all miss the lad.

69
00:04:23,026 --> 00:04:24,592
As my Grandowl Osgood

70
00:04:24,594 --> 00:04:26,027
- used to say...
- Wow!

71
00:04:26,029 --> 00:04:27,861
What did he used to say?

72
00:04:27,863 --> 00:04:29,630
I call the cherries. Extra
cream for me, please.

73
00:04:29,632 --> 00:04:31,666
No, it wasn't that.

74
00:04:31,668 --> 00:04:32,799
Is it a carrot cake?

75
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:34,168
Mmm. Larger.

76
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,003
Cake is what Tiggers like best!

77
00:04:36,005 --> 00:04:37,671
I'm gonna go for it.

78
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,842
What is this again?

79
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,046
Cake, cake, cake.
Will you never learn?

80
00:04:45,048 --> 00:04:47,114
I would prefer a lovely,
crunchy carrot.

81
00:04:47,116 --> 00:04:48,950
What's wrong with
something healthy?

82
00:04:48,952 --> 00:04:51,585
Good for your teeth. Sweets
go right to my feets!

83
00:04:51,587 --> 00:04:53,887
You won't be able to stop me!
Careful, Tigger.

84
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:55,623
Bounce and bounce!

85
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,024
Come on, Roo! And I'll bounce!

86
00:04:57,026 --> 00:04:58,560
And I'll bounce! And I'll...

87
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,573
Come on, Pooh.

88
00:05:14,043 --> 00:05:16,678
Where are we going,
Christopher Robin?

89
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,014
Nowhere.

90
00:05:18,714 --> 00:05:19,981
Oh.

91
00:05:19,983 --> 00:05:23,019
One of my favorite places.

92
00:05:24,921 --> 00:05:26,721
Saddle's too tight.

93
00:05:28,858 --> 00:05:30,123
What do you like to do best

94
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,695
in the world, Pooh?

95
00:05:32,661 --> 00:05:33,731
Hmm.

96
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,029
Well...

97
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:39,032
What I like best...

98
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:42,703
is me and Piglet...

99
00:05:42,705 --> 00:05:44,305
going to see you...

100
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:49,810
and you say, "What about
a little something?"

101
00:05:49,812 --> 00:05:51,645
And I say...

102
00:05:51,647 --> 00:05:55,616
"Well, I shouldn't mind
a little something."

103
00:05:55,618 --> 00:05:59,822
And it being a hummy
sort of a day outside.

104
00:06:01,324 --> 00:06:03,825
I like that too.

105
00:06:03,827 --> 00:06:06,863
But what I like doing
best is nothing.

106
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:10,765
How do you do nothing?

107
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:12,366
It's when people call out...

108
00:06:12,368 --> 00:06:14,402
"What are you going to
do, Christopher Robin?"

109
00:06:14,404 --> 00:06:16,169
And you say, "Oh, nothing."

110
00:06:16,171 --> 00:06:17,808
And then you go ahead and do it.

111
00:06:18,408 --> 00:06:20,340
Ah, yes.

112
00:06:20,342 --> 00:06:25,081
Doing nothing often leads
to the very best something.

113
00:06:33,356 --> 00:06:34,988
Pooh.

114
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,157
I'm not going to do
nothing anymore.

115
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,726
Oh.

116
00:06:38,728 --> 00:06:40,762
Never again?

117
00:06:40,764 --> 00:06:43,367
Well, they don't let you
at the boarding school.

118
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:49,436
Pooh...

119
00:06:49,438 --> 00:06:51,906
When I'm off not doing nothing,

120
00:06:51,908 --> 00:06:53,644
will you come up here sometimes?

121
00:06:54,344 --> 00:06:56,411
Just me?

122
00:06:56,413 --> 00:06:59,212
Where will you be?

123
00:06:59,214 --> 00:07:02,149
I'll be right here.

124
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:08,356
But what should happen
if you forget about me?

125
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:12,693
I won't ever forget about you, Pooh.
I promise.

126
00:07:12,695 --> 00:07:15,031
Not even when I'm a hundred.

127
00:07:17,767 --> 00:07:19,737
How old will I be then?

128
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,973
99.

129
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,343
Silly old bear.

130
00:07:27,877 --> 00:07:29,079
Hmm.

131
00:07:29,913 --> 00:07:32,249
99...

132
00:07:47,363 --> 00:07:49,130
Christopher, come on now.

133
00:07:49,132 --> 00:07:52,032
Do hurry up, darling.

134
00:07:52,034 --> 00:07:53,136
Christopher!

135
00:07:59,776 --> 00:08:02,346
Christopher Robin, your
mother is in the car!

136
00:08:08,985 --> 00:08:10,687
You take care.

137
00:08:13,356 --> 00:08:14,391
Off you go, young man.

138
00:08:39,516 --> 00:08:40,550
Christopher Robin!

139
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,256
Now concentrate!

140
00:09:20,156 --> 00:09:23,292
You're the man of the
house now, dear.

141
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:05,579
Would you like to sit down?

142
00:10:06,469 --> 00:10:07,570
Oh, um...

143
00:10:09,605 --> 00:10:10,840
Thank you.

144
00:10:12,941 --> 00:10:14,277
Cheeky blighter. Mmm-hmm.

145
00:10:42,537 --> 00:10:43,971
Will you write?

146
00:10:43,973 --> 00:10:45,438
Of course, every day.

147
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,597
<i>It's February 11th, 1944.</i>

148
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:12,667
<i>Soon the nightly battle
of London will be on.</i>

149
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:14,434
<i>This has been a
quiet day for us,</i>

150
00:11:14,436 --> 00:11:16,636
<i>but it won't be a quiet night.</i>

151
00:11:16,638 --> 00:11:18,972
<i>They'll destroy a few buildings,</i>

152
00:11:18,974 --> 00:11:20,441
<i>and kill a few people.</i>

153
00:11:20,443 --> 00:11:22,009

the people you...</i>

00:11:28,151 --> 00:11:31,351

<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

157
00:11:42,397 --> 00:11:44,597
This is Zebra-One-Charlie!

158
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:46,168
This is Zebra-One-Charlie.

159
00:11:47,235 --> 00:11:49,669
Where are my reinforcements?

160
00:11:49,671 --> 00:11:51,338
Ah, well done.

161
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:55,009
Mummy, when is
Daddy coming home?

162
00:12:19,102 --> 00:12:20,504
This is your daddy.

163
00:13:00,675 --> 00:13:03,309
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

164
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:05,111
Good morning, Mr. Robin.

165
00:13:05,113 --> 00:13:06,447
Good morning, Ms. Dane. Did
you have a pleasant...

166
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:08,215
I'd like them to reconsider...

167
00:13:08,217 --> 00:13:09,717
the brass fittings on
the chestnut wardrobes

168
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:11,351
for nickel-plated ones.

169
00:13:11,353 --> 00:13:13,053
I'll make a note of that.

170
00:13:13,055 --> 00:13:14,789
Now, what's the
holdup from Glasgow?

171
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:15,823
Tanners union dispute, sir.
What about Manchester?

172
00:13:15,825 --> 00:13:17,357
Waiting on fabric, sir.

173
00:13:17,359 --> 00:13:19,159
And what's Birmingham's excuse?

174
00:13:19,161 --> 00:13:20,593
It's just Birmingham, sir.
They're always late.

175
00:13:20,595 --> 00:13:22,362
I don't need to remind you,

176
00:13:22,364 --> 00:13:24,198
we're under increasing
pressure to cut costs!

177
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,832
Mr. Robin? Yes.

178
00:13:25,834 --> 00:13:27,802
If we replace the
second inner bevel

179
00:13:27,804 --> 00:13:29,370
with beechwood...

180
00:13:29,372 --> 00:13:31,438
we can increase buoyancy
by four percent.

181
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,573
And decrease weight
by point-two percent.

182
00:13:33,575 --> 00:13:35,108
And cost?

183
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,343
Oh, well, it might
save a few pennies.

184
00:13:37,345 --> 00:13:39,612
Oh, keep plugging
away, everyone.

185
00:13:39,614 --> 00:13:42,382
Bravo! That's what
we like to hear.

186
00:13:42,384 --> 00:13:43,550
Oh, Mr. Winslow, I could easily

187
00:13:43,552 --> 00:13:45,119
have come up to your office.

188
00:13:45,121 --> 00:13:47,420
No, no. I love to
come down here,

189
00:13:47,422 --> 00:13:49,122
get my hands dirty
once in a while.

190
00:13:49,124 --> 00:13:51,592
Oh sir, that sample is,
in fact, still wet.

191
00:13:51,594 --> 00:13:54,395
Yes. The, uh, smell
of the leather.

192
00:13:54,397 --> 00:13:56,130
The smell of hard work.

193
00:13:56,132 --> 00:13:58,765
Much rather be here than
in my stuffy office

194
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:00,701
where the boring stuff happens.

195
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,135
Yawn.

196
00:14:05,273 --> 00:14:08,476
This is where I belong. Down
here with the real men.

197
00:14:08,478 --> 00:14:10,276
And women.

198
00:14:10,278 --> 00:14:12,379
Sorry, always forget about them.

199
00:14:12,381 --> 00:14:14,648
Yes, I hate offices.

200
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,220
Give me some manual
labor any day of the...

201
00:14:20,388 --> 00:14:23,189
Let's, uh, go into your office.

202
00:14:23,191 --> 00:14:25,391
Yes, Mr. Winslow. Uh...

203
00:14:25,393 --> 00:14:27,428
After you, sir. Oh, no, please.

204
00:14:29,565 --> 00:14:31,233
Carry on.

205
00:14:32,535 --> 00:14:35,202
Ah.

206
00:14:35,204 --> 00:14:37,770
I spent all morning on that.

207
00:14:37,772 --> 00:14:40,274
Of all my father's
businesses, Winslow Luggage

208
00:14:40,276 --> 00:14:41,674
is the worst.

209
00:14:41,676 --> 00:14:43,476
Embarrassing for me, of course,

210
00:14:43,478 --> 00:14:44,712
but hardly surprising.

211
00:14:44,714 --> 00:14:46,713
There's been a war.

212
00:14:46,715 --> 00:14:50,650
Who has the time or the money
to go on holiday these days?

213
00:14:50,652 --> 00:14:54,321
In short, we need
to cut some costs.

214
00:14:54,323 --> 00:14:55,722
That's all I've been
working on, sir.

215
00:14:55,724 --> 00:14:56,792
We've made some progress.

216
00:14:58,694 --> 00:15:00,727
Three percent, or thereabouts.

217
00:15:00,729 --> 00:15:03,463
We need to cut deeper than
three percent, Robin.

218
00:15:03,465 --> 00:15:05,698
We're stuffed.
What did they say?

219
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,334
- I can't hear.
- Don't worry.

220
00:15:08,336 --> 00:15:09,803
I can lip read.

221
00:15:09,805 --> 00:15:11,371
How much deeper, sir?

222
00:15:11,373 --> 00:15:14,241
Twenty. Twenty!

223
00:15:14,243 --> 00:15:16,677
Twenty percent,
that's impossible.

224
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:19,179
He's saying, "Windy tent.
That's an apple."

225
00:15:19,181 --> 00:15:20,648
What are they talking about?

226
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,316
Perhaps it's a lunch order.

227
00:15:22,318 --> 00:15:24,518
Sir, your father
promised these people

228
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,587
good jobs to come home
to after the war.

229
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:28,389
Well, they'd do anything
for this company.

230
00:15:28,391 --> 00:15:31,257
I'd do anything
for this company.

231
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:34,827
My father has called an
emergency meeting on Monday.

232
00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:37,765
We need to produce
the cuts by then.

233
00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:39,600
It's sink or swim.

234
00:15:39,602 --> 00:15:41,235
I promised my wife and daughter

235
00:15:41,237 --> 00:15:44,337
I'd take them away
this weekend, sir.

236
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:46,743
I thought you'd do
anything for this company.

237
00:15:49,945 --> 00:15:52,612
Do you have dreams, Robin?

238
00:15:52,614 --> 00:15:54,314
I beg your pardon, sir?

239
00:15:54,316 --> 00:15:56,250
Well, I'll let you
into a little secret.

240
00:15:56,252 --> 00:15:57,918
Dreams don't come
for free, Robin.

241
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,353
Nothing comes from nothing.

242
00:16:00,355 --> 00:16:02,289
And if this ship goes down,

243
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,957
you need to ask yourself
the question...

244
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,863
"Am I a swimmer,
or am I a sinker?"

245
00:16:08,998 --> 00:16:10,934
Well, which one are you, Robin?

246
00:16:12,868 --> 00:16:14,268
Well, obviously
I'd like to reply

247
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,669
that I'm a swimmer, sir.

248
00:16:15,671 --> 00:16:17,538
Right answer! Me too.

249
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,573
That's why I shall be
working this weekend, also.

250
00:16:20,575 --> 00:16:23,343
All hands on deck and all that.

251
00:16:23,345 --> 00:16:25,446
This may help, a
list here of names.

252
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:28,285
People who can walk the
plank if you, um...

253
00:16:29,618 --> 00:16:33,319
if we don't come
up with something.

254
00:16:33,321 --> 00:16:34,523
It's all on you, Robin.

255
00:16:39,862 --> 00:16:41,598
Oh, good heavens.

256
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:45,602
Keep up the good work.

257
00:17:16,565 --> 00:17:17,997
Ah, Christopher.

258
00:17:17,999 --> 00:17:19,967
All work and no play, eh?
Ah, Cecil.

259
00:17:19,969 --> 00:17:23,336
Um, speaking of play, the wife
and I were just talking...

260
00:17:23,338 --> 00:17:25,672
and hate to be a
persistent Peter...

261
00:17:25,674 --> 00:17:28,377
but we're still waiting
for that gin rummy game.

262
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:31,378
Oh, yes, yes!

263
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,714
Well, one of these
days, eventually.

264
00:17:33,716 --> 00:17:36,050
Eager to finally see
how good you are.

265
00:17:48,863 --> 00:17:52,399
Madeline wanted to wait for
you but it got so late.

266
00:17:52,401 --> 00:17:54,435
Yes, I'm sorry, I got
held up at work.

267
00:17:54,437 --> 00:17:56,637
I know. Katherine
rang to let me know.

268
00:17:56,639 --> 00:17:59,473
She also said you'd be
working this weekend.

269
00:17:59,475 --> 00:18:01,444
I suppose you won't be
coming to the cottage.

270
00:18:04,346 --> 00:18:06,013
Well, it can't be helped.

271
00:18:06,015 --> 00:18:07,814
It never can.

272
00:18:19,694 --> 00:18:20,960
Hello.

273
00:18:20,962 --> 00:18:22,862
What've you got there?

274
00:18:22,864 --> 00:18:27,801
Oh, uh... It's yours. I
found it in the attic.

275
00:18:27,803 --> 00:18:31,675
It has loads of things
from when you were my age.

276
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:35,743
Haycorns.

277
00:18:35,745 --> 00:18:37,781
I mean, acorns.

278
00:18:39,782 --> 00:18:42,049
Nothing of any great importance.

279
00:18:42,051 --> 00:18:43,851
Don't you think you
should be doing something

280
00:18:43,853 --> 00:18:45,386
more useful with your time?

281
00:18:45,388 --> 00:18:46,820
Reading perhaps?

282
00:18:46,822 --> 00:18:47,854
I've already finished
the book list

283
00:18:47,856 --> 00:18:49,489
that Grayford Prep sent.

284
00:18:49,491 --> 00:18:52,059
I'm way ahead. I've
been very efficient.

285
00:18:52,061 --> 00:18:54,695
Oh, good. That's good.

286
00:18:54,697 --> 00:18:57,130
Yes, so there's no work
to do this weekend.

287
00:18:57,132 --> 00:19:00,167
We can do whatever we want.
We'll go back to your cottage.

288
00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:01,735
Play where you played.

289
00:19:01,737 --> 00:19:05,037
We can do puzzles, board games.

290
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,607
Right. Um...

291
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:08,878
I wanted to talk
to you about that.

292
00:19:11,413 --> 00:19:13,415
I can't come this weekend.

293
00:19:17,652 --> 00:19:19,553
But summer will be over soon.

294
00:19:19,555 --> 00:19:21,188
I have to stay for work.

295
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,457
You and your mother will go.

296
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:24,957
I never see you.

297
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:28,094
Well, I wished I didn't
have to stay for work...

298
00:19:28,096 --> 00:19:30,964
but dreams don't come
for free, Madeline.

299
00:19:30,966 --> 00:19:32,698
You have to work for them.

300
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,935
Nothing comes from nothing.

301
00:19:34,937 --> 00:19:36,940
Do you understand?

302
00:19:39,074 --> 00:19:40,844
I understand.

303
00:19:42,878 --> 00:19:45,014
I suppose you can
keep these here then.

304
00:19:49,017 --> 00:19:50,687
Yes.

305
00:19:53,922 --> 00:19:57,861
Do you think you could
read to me for a minute?

306
00:20:00,496 --> 00:20:02,165
Of course.

307
00:20:03,132 --> 00:20:04,868
Yes.

308
00:20:10,573 --> 00:20:12,505
"The Victorian Era signified"

309
00:20:12,507 --> 00:20:14,207
"the height of the
Industrial Revolution..."

310
00:20:14,209 --> 00:20:17,177
"and was viewed as the apex
of the British Empire."

311
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:19,079
Oh, we've got a
real good one here.

312
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:20,714
"It followed the
Georgian period..."

313
00:20:20,716 --> 00:20:23,115
"and preceded the
Edwardian period."

314
00:20:23,117 --> 00:20:24,186
Actually...

315
00:20:25,054 --> 00:20:26,186
Father.

316
00:20:26,188 --> 00:20:27,888
Yes?

317
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,526
I'm a bit tired.

318
00:20:31,727 --> 00:20:33,025
Right.

319
00:20:33,027 --> 00:20:35,062
Yes. Um...

320
00:20:35,064 --> 00:20:36,099
You sure?

321
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:41,471
Hmm. Of course.

322
00:20:43,905 --> 00:20:44,940
Well...

323
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,707
Good night.

324
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:49,211
Good night.

325
00:21:03,758 --> 00:21:05,292
<i>I've been thinking.</i>

326
00:21:05,294 --> 00:21:07,527
You two don't have to go
to the country tomorrow.

327
00:21:07,529 --> 00:21:09,263
We've been over this. She
needs to play, Christopher.

328
00:21:09,265 --> 00:21:11,265
Not spend all of
her time studying.

329
00:21:11,267 --> 00:21:13,534
Grayford Prep is the best!

330
00:21:13,536 --> 00:21:15,101
She told me she's
done all the reading.

331
00:21:15,103 --> 00:21:17,970
Because she would do
anything to please you.

332
00:21:17,972 --> 00:21:19,805
But there are perfectly good
schools here in London...

333
00:21:19,807 --> 00:21:21,742
that don't require
us to send her away.

334
00:21:21,744 --> 00:21:23,043
And come on, Christopher.

335
00:21:23,045 --> 00:21:24,611
You know she doesn't want to go.

336
00:21:24,613 --> 00:21:26,482
I went away when I was her age.

337
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,615
It'll prepare her
for the real world.

338
00:21:29,617 --> 00:21:31,150
Set her up for a career.

339
00:21:31,152 --> 00:21:32,956
Well, isn't that our
responsibility to her?

340
00:21:35,723 --> 00:21:36,758
What?

341
00:21:38,192 --> 00:21:41,128
Do you even like your job?

342
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,863
What's that got to
do with anything?

343
00:21:43,865 --> 00:21:45,899
You're going to hit your limit.

344
00:21:45,901 --> 00:21:46,967
One day you're going to crack.

345
00:21:46,969 --> 00:21:48,901
Evelyn.

346
00:21:48,903 --> 00:21:51,971
Look, if I work really hard
now, then in the future...

347
00:21:51,973 --> 00:21:53,607
our life will be...

348
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:56,576
Will be what? Will be better?
Worse?

349
00:21:56,578 --> 00:21:58,611
We don't care, we want you.

350
00:21:58,613 --> 00:22:00,112
This is life, Christopher.

351
00:22:00,114 --> 00:22:01,747
This weekend is your life.

352
00:22:01,749 --> 00:22:03,583
Your life is happening now.

353
00:22:03,585 --> 00:22:05,619
Right in front of you.

354
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:07,286
Look. Hello!

355
00:22:07,288 --> 00:22:09,992
- Yahoo. Remember me?
- I'm your wife.

356
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,126
And that's another thing.

357
00:22:13,128 --> 00:22:15,595
I haven't seen you
laugh in years.

358
00:22:15,597 --> 00:22:17,063
Evelyn.

359
00:22:17,065 --> 00:22:18,631
I want to see you
have fun, sometimes.

360
00:22:18,633 --> 00:22:19,999
Be silly. I didn't fall for you

361
00:22:20,001 --> 00:22:21,537
because you had
your career set up.

362
00:22:29,344 --> 00:22:32,079
Was it my dancing?

363
00:22:32,081 --> 00:22:35,649
Actually, yes, it was...
It was dancing with you.

364
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:37,684
Being held by you.

365
00:22:37,686 --> 00:22:39,852
Look, don't make
this harder on me.

366
00:22:39,854 --> 00:22:41,790
I am sorry.

367
00:22:43,257 --> 00:22:45,995
I'll take my suitcase upstairs.

368
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,867
Where is my suitcase?

369
00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:55,805
I didn't bother packing it.

370
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,616
Have a nice time.

371
00:23:08,116 --> 00:23:09,115
Goodbye.

372
00:23:09,117 --> 00:23:10,652
Goodbye.

373
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:19,162
Take care. Hmm.

374
00:23:20,895 --> 00:23:22,632
See you soon.

375
00:23:38,913 --> 00:23:41,081
We can have that
game of gin rummy

376
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:43,182
now that you're a
Tommy-time-on-his-hands.

377
00:23:43,184 --> 00:23:44,252
Ah.

378
00:23:59,701 --> 00:24:01,301
<i>Dear Father...</i>

379
00:24:01,303 --> 00:24:03,736
<i>I never knew you
could draw so well.</i>

380
00:24:03,738 --> 00:24:06,139
<i>Maybe you could hang
this one next to mine.</i>

381
00:24:06,141 --> 00:24:08,111
<i>Love, Madeline.</i>

382
00:24:38,172 --> 00:24:39,741
Honey.

383
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:50,050
Honey!

384
00:24:50,052 --> 00:24:51,784
Where am I?

385
00:24:51,786 --> 00:24:54,755
I can't see anything.

386
00:24:54,757 --> 00:24:56,926
Oh, that's right.

387
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,525
Oh.

388
00:24:59,527 --> 00:25:01,163
Good morning, house.

389
00:25:01,997 --> 00:25:03,130
Oh.

390
00:25:03,132 --> 00:25:05,465
How are you today?

391
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:11,403
Time to make myself hungry
with my stoutness exercise.

392
00:25:11,405 --> 00:25:15,475
<i>♪ When I up, down,
touch the ground</i>

393
00:25:15,477 --> 00:25:19,345
<i>♪ It puts me in the mood</i>

394
00:25:19,347 --> 00:25:22,047
<i>♪ When I up, down, turn around</i>

395
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:27,987
<i>♪ In the mood for food</i>

396
00:25:27,989 --> 00:25:31,358
<i>♪ And I'm off, ready
for my morning honey ♪</i>

397
00:25:35,096 --> 00:25:36,530
Ouch.

398
00:25:36,532 --> 00:25:39,899
Oh, some honey will
make me feel better.

399
00:25:39,901 --> 00:25:42,369
Oh, bother.

400
00:25:42,371 --> 00:25:45,906
Somebody seems to have
eaten all the honey.

401
00:25:45,908 --> 00:25:47,142
Oh.

402
00:25:59,488 --> 00:26:00,757
Hmm.

403
00:26:01,523 --> 00:26:03,223
Oh, my.

404
00:26:03,225 --> 00:26:05,592
Foggy today.

405
00:26:05,594 --> 00:26:08,394
If I know anything
about anything...

406
00:26:08,396 --> 00:26:12,399
it's easy to lose your
way on a foggy day.

407
00:26:12,401 --> 00:26:18,205
And rather hard to
find the way back.

408
00:26:18,207 --> 00:26:20,974
Piglet always has a
little smackerel

409
00:26:20,976 --> 00:26:23,045
of something hidden away.

410
00:26:24,947 --> 00:26:26,783
Piglet?

411
00:26:28,283 --> 00:26:29,882
It's Pooh.

412
00:26:29,884 --> 00:26:31,887
Are you home?

413
00:26:34,456 --> 00:26:36,622
It would appear not.

414
00:26:36,624 --> 00:26:38,859
Rabbit!

415
00:26:38,861 --> 00:26:41,093
Are you home?

416
00:26:41,095 --> 00:26:44,063
It's Bear speaking.

417
00:26:44,065 --> 00:26:45,968
Eeyore!

418
00:26:47,001 --> 00:26:49,271
Where is everybody?

419
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:53,340
How gloomy and sad.

420
00:26:53,342 --> 00:26:56,344
If only Eeyore were
here to enjoy it.

421
00:26:57,112 --> 00:26:58,544
Hello?

422
00:26:58,546 --> 00:27:00,479
Anybody here?

423
00:27:00,481 --> 00:27:03,483
Can anybody hear me?

424
00:27:03,485 --> 00:27:05,421
Hello?

425
00:27:08,523 --> 00:27:10,927
What has happened to my friends?

426
00:27:17,132 --> 00:27:18,465
Oh, dear.

427
00:27:18,467 --> 00:27:20,633
I appear to have
reached the end...

428
00:27:20,635 --> 00:27:23,136
of my thoughts.

429
00:27:24,506 --> 00:27:25,908
Oh.

430
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,876
Hmm.

431
00:27:34,548 --> 00:27:36,585
<i>Come on, Pooh.</i>

432
00:27:40,188 --> 00:27:42,391
Christopher?

433
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:45,194
Are you there?

434
00:27:46,161 --> 00:27:47,593
It's me.

435
00:27:47,595 --> 00:27:49,996
Winnie the Pooh.

436
00:27:49,998 --> 00:27:52,969
Are you finally home?

437
00:27:54,335 --> 00:27:56,639
Think, think, think.

438
00:27:58,273 --> 00:28:01,573
It would seem I
must go forward...

439
00:28:01,575 --> 00:28:03,275
where I have never been...

440
00:28:03,277 --> 00:28:04,479
rather than backwards...

441
00:28:05,948 --> 00:28:08,217
where I have.

442
00:28:11,085 --> 00:28:15,588
Christopher Robin must
help me find everybody.

443
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:19,124
Or help everybody find me.

444
00:28:19,126 --> 00:28:22,931
That will be the order
of looking for things.

445
00:28:28,069 --> 00:28:30,972
Christopher? Are you here?

446
00:28:32,106 --> 00:28:33,341
It's Pooh.

447
00:28:41,016 --> 00:28:42,919
Hello.

448
00:28:43,584 --> 00:28:45,986
It's Pooh.

449
00:28:45,988 --> 00:28:47,219
Are you hiding?

450
00:28:56,131 --> 00:28:59,064
Oh, I'm getting very sleepy.

451
00:28:59,066 --> 00:29:00,734
Oh.

452
00:29:00,736 --> 00:29:03,102
And that looks like a bed.

453
00:29:08,709 --> 00:29:12,315
Where, oh, where is
Christopher Robin?

454
00:29:52,187 --> 00:29:55,255
What to do, what
to do, what to do?

455
00:29:55,257 --> 00:29:57,692
What to do, indeed.

456
00:30:01,328 --> 00:30:03,295
Pooh?

457
00:30:03,297 --> 00:30:06,167
Christopher Robin! No!

458
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:08,601
No, no, no, no, no!

459
00:30:08,603 --> 00:30:10,536
You can't be here.

460
00:30:10,538 --> 00:30:12,371
Hmm.

461
00:30:12,373 --> 00:30:14,573
This can't be happening.

462
00:30:14,575 --> 00:30:16,708
- It's stress.
- It's not stress.

463
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,210
My God, I'm stressed.

464
00:30:18,212 --> 00:30:20,112
It's Pooh. I'm so exhausted.

465
00:30:20,114 --> 00:30:21,413
Evelyn warned me.

466
00:30:21,415 --> 00:30:23,349
I like to be warmed.

467
00:30:23,351 --> 00:30:26,652
Warmed and cozy.

468
00:30:26,654 --> 00:30:28,324
I've cracked.

469
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:33,293
Oh. I've totally cracked.

470
00:30:33,295 --> 00:30:35,394
I don't see any cracks.

471
00:30:35,396 --> 00:30:37,499
A few wrinkles maybe.

472
00:30:38,467 --> 00:30:40,169
Pooh!

473
00:30:41,369 --> 00:30:43,205
You're here!

474
00:30:44,372 --> 00:30:46,238
How are you here, Pooh?

475
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,640
Oh. Well, I went
through the door

476
00:30:48,642 --> 00:30:51,844
through which Christopher
Robin is known to appear.

477
00:30:51,846 --> 00:30:55,614
And now, I'm here!

478
00:30:55,616 --> 00:30:57,217
But the tree I remember

479
00:30:57,219 --> 00:30:58,284
was behind the
cottage in Sussex...

480
00:30:58,286 --> 00:30:59,651
not here in London.

481
00:30:59,653 --> 00:31:02,188
I suppose it's where
it needs to be.

482
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:04,493
There's no opening.

483
00:31:05,826 --> 00:31:07,893
There's no door on
the other side.

484
00:31:07,895 --> 00:31:10,830
Oh. We must not need it anymore.

485
00:31:10,832 --> 00:31:12,498
That's a silly explanation.

486
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,167
Why, thank you.

487
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:17,836
Are you glad to see me,
Christopher Robin?

488
00:31:17,838 --> 00:31:20,372
Well, hello there!

489
00:31:20,374 --> 00:31:22,876
Ooh, what have you got
there, secret Susan?

490
00:31:22,878 --> 00:31:24,276
Uh, um...

491
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:27,647
Well, it's a, it's a... a cat.

492
00:31:27,649 --> 00:31:29,215
Yes, definitely.

493
00:31:29,217 --> 00:31:30,582
Just a cat.

494
00:31:30,584 --> 00:31:32,418
Ooh, I love cats. May I? Can I?

495
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:35,354
Well, not this one, because
it's a diseased cat.

496
00:31:35,356 --> 00:31:37,422
It's ferocious.
Ooh, it's a biter.

497
00:31:37,424 --> 00:31:38,858
I was about to take it
in, give it some milk.

498
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,426
You know, rehabilitate it.

499
00:31:40,428 --> 00:31:41,361
You're squishing me.

500
00:31:41,363 --> 00:31:42,928
What on earth?

501
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,596
- Did you hear my voice there?
- Yeah.

502
00:31:44,598 --> 00:31:46,565
I do that funny voice,
"You're squashing me..."

503
00:31:46,567 --> 00:31:50,503
"with your demands
to play gin rummy."

504
00:31:50,505 --> 00:31:52,604
I was like a ventriloquist
when I was younger.

505
00:31:52,606 --> 00:31:55,742
Very good. Very good.

506
00:31:55,744 --> 00:31:57,744
We've got all weekend.

507
00:31:57,746 --> 00:31:58,777
For?

508
00:31:58,779 --> 00:32:00,612
Gin rummy.

509
00:32:00,614 --> 00:32:02,415
We should probably try and
play cards tomorrow then.

510
00:32:02,417 --> 00:32:03,582
I'd love that.

511
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,784
Yes! Tomorrow?

512
00:32:04,786 --> 00:32:06,386
Well, yes, good evening!

513
00:32:06,388 --> 00:32:08,655
Good night! Have a nice...

514
00:32:08,657 --> 00:32:10,590
See you tomorrow.

515
00:32:10,592 --> 00:32:11,623
Stop wriggling, he's
gonna see you moving.

516
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:13,192
Good evening.

517
00:32:13,194 --> 00:32:14,427
Stop it.

518
00:32:14,429 --> 00:32:16,262
Meow! You see?

519
00:32:16,264 --> 00:32:18,297
Ha! Yeah.

520
00:32:27,374 --> 00:32:28,541
Mmm.

521
00:32:28,543 --> 00:32:31,710
Oh, it really is very good.

522
00:32:31,712 --> 00:32:34,581
Are you sure you wouldn't
like some, Christopher Robin?

523
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:37,283
Yes, yes, I'm sure.

524
00:32:37,285 --> 00:32:40,386
Pooh, how ever did
you recognize me?

525
00:32:40,388 --> 00:32:42,322
After all these years.

526
00:32:42,324 --> 00:32:43,359
Well...

527
00:32:44,825 --> 00:32:46,892
You haven't changed a bit.

528
00:32:46,894 --> 00:32:48,497
But I've changed tremendously.

529
00:32:49,331 --> 00:32:50,866
Not right here.

530
00:32:53,602 --> 00:32:56,768
It's still you looking out.

531
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,438
I'm covered in honey now.

532
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,476
Oh. Oh, yes, I see.

533
00:33:06,914 --> 00:33:08,883
Sticky mess.

534
00:33:11,286 --> 00:33:14,786
Your floor is very sticky.

535
00:33:14,788 --> 00:33:17,357
Pooh. Oh...

536
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:20,293
Oh, this place is very big.

537
00:33:20,295 --> 00:33:22,861
Do you live here all alone?

538
00:33:22,863 --> 00:33:25,631
Just now, yes. But usually, no.

539
00:33:25,633 --> 00:33:27,033
My wife and daughter

540
00:33:27,035 --> 00:33:29,569
are in the countryside
for the weekend.

541
00:33:29,571 --> 00:33:32,304
Well, why aren't you with them?

542
00:33:32,306 --> 00:33:33,672
Well...

543
00:33:33,674 --> 00:33:34,774
Oh.

544
00:33:34,776 --> 00:33:36,508
Sticky business.

545
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,611
I had to stay for work.

546
00:33:38,613 --> 00:33:40,846
Why are you here and not in
the forest with your friends?

547
00:33:40,848 --> 00:33:42,314
That's the question, Pooh.

548
00:33:42,316 --> 00:33:44,650
Well, I couldn't find anybody.

549
00:33:44,652 --> 00:33:47,687
And, I couldn't
find anyone either.

550
00:33:47,689 --> 00:33:49,354
And I looked for them both.

551
00:33:49,356 --> 00:33:52,358
Hello?

552
00:33:53,628 --> 00:33:56,562
Piglet? Eeyore? Tigger?

553
00:33:56,564 --> 00:33:58,331
Where is everybody?

554
00:33:58,333 --> 00:34:01,066
Exactly! Where is Tigger,
or Kanga, or Roo?

555
00:34:01,068 --> 00:34:02,669
That's why I'm here.

556
00:34:02,671 --> 00:34:04,403
I'm sure I don't
know where they are.

557
00:34:04,405 --> 00:34:06,165
I've scarcely thought
about them in 30 years.

558
00:34:08,008 --> 00:34:10,409
Well, we think about
you every day.

559
00:34:10,411 --> 00:34:13,612
Well, that's very kind.
And I'm sorry, Pooh.

560
00:34:13,614 --> 00:34:16,082
But it's getting late,
and I'm very busy.

561
00:34:16,084 --> 00:34:19,419
I haven't got time to help you look.
I'm on a deadline.

562
00:34:19,421 --> 00:34:20,752
So, do you think
you might just...

563
00:34:23,591 --> 00:34:25,828
Oh, you silly old bear.

564
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:11,573
Good night, Winnie the Pooh.

565
00:35:21,116 --> 00:35:23,116
What on earth!

566
00:35:23,118 --> 00:35:24,917
- Pooh!
- Oh, dear.

567
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,853
What luck.

568
00:35:27,855 --> 00:35:28,987
Pooh!

569
00:35:28,989 --> 00:35:30,656
Your ladder is broken.

570
00:35:30,658 --> 00:35:32,692
That's not a ladder.
That was a shelf.

571
00:35:32,694 --> 00:35:35,895
That explains why it's
no good for climbing.

572
00:35:37,464 --> 00:35:39,565
I haven't got time
to muck about.

573
00:35:39,567 --> 00:35:42,467
I should be working.
Trying to find a solution.

574
00:35:42,469 --> 00:35:44,837
Even though I think
it may be impossible.

575
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:47,540
People say nothing
is impossible.

576
00:35:47,542 --> 00:35:49,741
But I do nothing every day.

577
00:35:49,743 --> 00:35:52,545
No, Pooh, that's not the...
Never mind.

578
00:35:52,547 --> 00:35:54,679
Look, I can't be distracted.

579
00:35:54,681 --> 00:35:56,681
Which is why you
need to go home.

580
00:35:56,683 --> 00:35:58,519
But how?

581
00:36:07,728 --> 00:36:09,462
Sussex.

582
00:36:09,464 --> 00:36:11,531
We go to Sussex.

583
00:36:11,533 --> 00:36:14,670
And we get you back in
your own home. Now!

584
00:36:21,475 --> 00:36:24,743
It's very loud and not
in a hummy sort of way.

585
00:36:24,745 --> 00:36:26,946
Well, welcome to London.

586
00:36:29,783 --> 00:36:33,085
Well, hello there. Are you
on an expotition, too?

587
00:36:33,087 --> 00:36:34,656
Oh, bother! Pooh!

588
00:36:36,491 --> 00:36:37,824
What did you do?

589
00:36:37,826 --> 00:36:39,558
Do you think he's all right?

590
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,226
Come here. Come in here.

591
00:36:41,228 --> 00:36:42,895
Look.

592
00:36:42,897 --> 00:36:45,063
You can't just keep
saying hello to people.

593
00:36:45,065 --> 00:36:47,132
People can't see you
moving and talking.

594
00:36:47,134 --> 00:36:48,467
But why?

595
00:36:48,469 --> 00:36:51,002
Because, because...

596
00:36:51,004 --> 00:36:52,839
You're different.

597
00:36:52,841 --> 00:36:55,475
And people don't like
things that are different.

598
00:36:55,477 --> 00:36:58,109
So I shouldn't be me.

599
00:36:58,111 --> 00:37:00,615
No! No, you should
always be yourself.

600
00:37:01,716 --> 00:37:03,649
Oh, this is very confusing.

601
00:37:03,651 --> 00:37:05,083
It may be the hunger.

602
00:37:05,085 --> 00:37:07,487
You've just eaten!
Oh, that's right.

603
00:37:07,489 --> 00:37:09,254
Maybe I didn't eat enough.

604
00:37:09,256 --> 00:37:11,857
Look, never mind about that.

605
00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:14,993
For now, just try and be
a less exuberant you.

606
00:37:14,995 --> 00:37:17,129
Ex-Pooh-berant. Flop.

607
00:37:17,131 --> 00:37:18,498
Sag.

608
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,632
Go limp.

609
00:37:19,634 --> 00:37:21,600
Flop. Sag. Yes!

610
00:37:21,602 --> 00:37:23,069
Go limp.

611
00:37:23,071 --> 00:37:24,870
I know, I've got it!

612
00:37:24,872 --> 00:37:26,571
How about, play "Naptime."

613
00:37:26,573 --> 00:37:27,973
I love play! Well, let's see it.

614
00:37:27,975 --> 00:37:30,643
Like this?

615
00:37:30,645 --> 00:37:33,545
Well done! Now, just
keep absolutely still.

616
00:37:33,547 --> 00:37:35,815
That's it. Come on.

617
00:37:35,817 --> 00:37:39,051
Christopher! There's a
rumbly in my tumbly.

618
00:37:39,053 --> 00:37:40,920
Let's stop for a snack.

619
00:37:40,922 --> 00:37:42,654
There's no time for snacks.

620
00:37:42,656 --> 00:37:45,658
What about a smackerel?
Play "Naptime!"

621
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,726
Balloons! Come and get them.

622
00:37:47,728 --> 00:37:49,661
May I have a travel balloon?
You don't need a balloon.

623
00:37:49,663 --> 00:37:51,163
Well, I know I don't need one...

624
00:37:51,165 --> 00:37:53,199
but I would like one
very, very much, please.

625
00:37:53,201 --> 00:37:54,966
Please. Please!

626
00:37:54,968 --> 00:37:56,201
We've got all your
favorite colors!

627
00:37:56,203 --> 00:37:58,004
I'd like a balloon, please.

628
00:37:58,006 --> 00:37:59,105
What color?

629
00:37:59,107 --> 00:38:00,239
Red.

630
00:38:00,241 --> 00:38:02,908
Uh, red will be fine, yes.

631
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,243
Thank you very much.

632
00:38:04,245 --> 00:38:05,978
Thank you ever so much.

633
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,245
Balloons!

634
00:38:24,765 --> 00:38:25,998
Here is your ticket.

635
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,333
Thank you very much.

636
00:38:27,335 --> 00:38:29,034
Good morning, sir.

637
00:38:29,036 --> 00:38:30,605
- Good morning.
- Why is he in a cage?

638
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,839
I'd like a return
ticket, please?

639
00:38:33,841 --> 00:38:35,574
To Hartfield in Sussex.
Thank you.

640
00:38:35,576 --> 00:38:37,243
Certainly, sir.

641
00:38:37,245 --> 00:38:38,685
Could you give me
some space, please?

642
00:38:39,881 --> 00:38:41,147
Your ticket.

643
00:38:43,951 --> 00:38:45,750
Here we are.

644
00:38:45,752 --> 00:38:47,819
And, uh, still two minutes to spare.
So, good, yes?

645
00:38:47,821 --> 00:38:49,690
On the dot, sir.
Good, thank you.

646
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:54,759
The balloon went that way, sir.

647
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:56,198
Thank you.

648
00:39:02,203 --> 00:39:03,902
Excuse me.

649
00:39:03,904 --> 00:39:05,904
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

650
00:39:05,906 --> 00:39:07,172
I'm terribly sorry.

651
00:39:07,174 --> 00:39:08,643
Sorry, sorry.

652
00:39:15,817 --> 00:39:17,216
There he is!

653
00:39:17,218 --> 00:39:18,620
Right.

654
00:39:21,089 --> 00:39:23,054
Excuse me.

655
00:39:23,056 --> 00:39:25,761
You're not a Woozle, are you?

656
00:39:28,062 --> 00:39:31,096
Oh, Christopher Robin!
Thank goodness.

657
00:39:31,098 --> 00:39:33,699
Give me that! That's mine.
Give it back.

658
00:39:33,701 --> 00:39:35,000
Well, he was mine
first, you know?

659
00:39:35,002 --> 00:39:36,134
That is true.

660
00:39:36,136 --> 00:39:38,069
Oh, for heaven's sake!

661
00:39:38,071 --> 00:39:40,031
You can't just take a teddy
bear from a grown man.

662
00:39:42,377 --> 00:39:44,243
Christopher, could
you turn the world

663
00:39:44,245 --> 00:39:46,946
right side up again, please?

664
00:39:46,948 --> 00:39:49,949
Did that say honey?
Can we go back?

665
00:39:49,951 --> 00:39:51,817
Ooh!

666
00:39:51,819 --> 00:39:53,219
- Excuse me.
- Much better.

667
00:39:53,221 --> 00:39:54,754
I thought you were
playing "Naptime."

668
00:39:54,756 --> 00:39:55,956
It was one of my briefer naps.

669
00:39:58,259 --> 00:40:01,127
But, Christopher, my balloon.

670
00:40:01,129 --> 00:40:04,330
Well, it's gone now. You don't
need it anymore anyway.

671
00:40:04,332 --> 00:40:06,399
But it did make me very happy.

672
00:40:06,401 --> 00:40:08,067
Did it not make you happy?

673
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:09,935
Not really.

674
00:40:24,352 --> 00:40:26,819
Do you always have
that case with you?

675
00:40:26,821 --> 00:40:29,422
What? A case?

676
00:40:29,424 --> 00:40:32,692
My briefcase? Yes, usually. Why?

677
00:40:32,694 --> 00:40:35,261
Is it more important than...

678
00:40:35,263 --> 00:40:36,398
a balloon?

679
00:40:39,701 --> 00:40:42,701
Yes, it's more important
than a balloon.

680
00:40:42,703 --> 00:40:44,804
I see.

681
00:40:44,806 --> 00:40:47,873
More like... a blanket.

682
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:49,107
Yes.

683
00:40:49,109 --> 00:40:52,814
More like a blanket.

684
00:40:53,848 --> 00:40:55,815
What does it do?

685
00:40:55,817 --> 00:40:57,348
What?

686
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:59,784
It's for keeping very
important things in.

687
00:40:59,786 --> 00:41:01,420
Pooh, do you think
you might be able to

688
00:41:01,422 --> 00:41:03,154
amuse yourself for a while?

689
00:41:03,156 --> 00:41:04,892
I have got some rather
pressing work to do.

690
00:41:07,895 --> 00:41:09,261
House.

691
00:41:09,263 --> 00:41:10,795
Clouds.

692
00:41:10,797 --> 00:41:12,230
House.

693
00:41:12,232 --> 00:41:14,100
Tree.

694
00:41:14,102 --> 00:41:16,801
Bush. A man.

695
00:41:16,803 --> 00:41:19,038
Dog. Pooh.

696
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,140
What're you doing? Oh,
I'm playing a game.

697
00:41:21,142 --> 00:41:24,042
It's called "Say What You See."

698
00:41:24,044 --> 00:41:27,281
Could you "Say What You
See" a little more quietly?

699
00:41:32,152 --> 00:41:33,384
House.

700
00:41:33,386 --> 00:41:34,819
Grass.

701
00:41:34,821 --> 00:41:36,221
Trees.

702
00:41:36,223 --> 00:41:38,223
Pond.

703
00:41:38,225 --> 00:41:40,259
I don't know what that is.

704
00:41:40,261 --> 00:41:41,697
Pooh. Well, that's a man.

705
00:41:42,497 --> 00:41:44,395
Pooh.

706
00:41:44,397 --> 00:41:48,433
Little bit more quietly. Please?

707
00:41:48,435 --> 00:41:52,807
Oh, I'm sorry, this
compartment is rather full.

708
00:41:54,142 --> 00:41:56,509
It's his naptime.

709
00:42:03,817 --> 00:42:04,886
Hmm.

710
00:42:11,058 --> 00:42:14,062
<i>We'll save at least
322 pounds a month.</i>

711
00:42:15,495 --> 00:42:18,297
<i>Well, that's not nothing.</i>

712
00:42:18,299 --> 00:42:21,299
Which brings us to 14%.

713
00:42:21,301 --> 00:42:22,837
<i>Still not enough.</i>

714
00:42:26,073 --> 00:42:27,906
<i>Someone's gonna have
to walk the plank.</i>

715
00:42:27,908 --> 00:42:29,942
<i>They'll never forgive
me for this.</i>

716
00:42:29,944 --> 00:42:31,476
<i>Sorry, Gary.</i>

717
00:42:31,478 --> 00:42:34,212
Now arriving at
Hartfield Station.

718
00:42:41,855 --> 00:42:44,357
Hartfield! Hartfield Station!

719
00:42:48,228 --> 00:42:50,397
Look. My balloon! Oh.

720
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,833
Now come on, Pooh.
We've got to hurry.

721
00:42:54,835 --> 00:42:56,935
Yes. We need to
find our friends.

722
00:42:56,937 --> 00:42:58,304
No, Pooh. I meant,

723
00:42:58,306 --> 00:43:00,342
I have to get back for work. Oh.

724
00:43:15,589 --> 00:43:17,556
Are we going in? No, no, Pooh.

725
00:43:17,558 --> 00:43:19,024
We must keep very quiet.

726
00:43:19,026 --> 00:43:21,292
Not let them see us. Come on.

727
00:43:21,294 --> 00:43:22,493
Stay low.

728
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,864
Oh.

729
00:43:24,866 --> 00:43:26,464
Who is that? Pooh!

730
00:43:26,466 --> 00:43:29,400
She can't be Pooh. I'm Pooh.

731
00:43:29,402 --> 00:43:32,237
No, that's Evelyn. My wife.

732
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:33,504
Oh.

733
00:43:33,506 --> 00:43:36,010
She looks very kind.

734
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:38,813
She is very kind.

735
00:43:44,919 --> 00:43:47,585
And who is that?

736
00:43:47,587 --> 00:43:49,587
That's Madeline.

737
00:43:49,589 --> 00:43:51,623
My daughter.

738
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:53,091
Can she come and play with us?

739
00:43:53,093 --> 00:43:54,195
No, she can't come.

740
00:43:55,395 --> 00:43:57,196
Does she not like to play?

741
00:43:57,198 --> 00:43:59,466
No, no, it's just... Well,
look, she's working.

742
00:44:00,968 --> 00:44:03,402
Oh, I see.

743
00:44:03,404 --> 00:44:05,507
Does she have a
briefcase like you?

744
00:44:07,207 --> 00:44:08,410
No.

745
00:44:09,277 --> 00:44:11,042
Come on, Pooh.

746
00:44:11,044 --> 00:44:12,243
Do you think she'd
like my red balloon?

747
00:44:12,245 --> 00:44:13,679
It might make her happy.

748
00:44:13,681 --> 00:44:15,580
What is it with you
and the balloon?

749
00:44:15,582 --> 00:44:18,317
There's more to happiness
than just balloons, Pooh.

750
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:22,087
Look, Madeline is happy and
I'm happy that she's happy.

751
00:44:22,089 --> 00:44:23,625
Well, let's go.

752
00:44:42,509 --> 00:44:44,176
There, Pooh.

753
00:44:44,178 --> 00:44:46,281
I got you home.

754
00:44:49,683 --> 00:44:51,583
Aren't you coming with me?

755
00:44:51,585 --> 00:44:53,217
I can't. I've gotta
go back to London.

756
00:44:53,219 --> 00:44:54,953
But I need your help.

757
00:44:54,955 --> 00:44:57,022
I've lost all of my friends.

758
00:44:57,024 --> 00:44:58,656
Perhaps they're back now...

759
00:44:58,658 --> 00:45:00,538
and you can tell them all
about your adventures.

760
00:45:02,196 --> 00:45:04,562
I would like to do that.

761
00:45:04,564 --> 00:45:06,333
Off you go then.

762
00:45:10,471 --> 00:45:13,404
Goodbye, Christopher.

763
00:45:13,406 --> 00:45:15,376
Goodbye, Pooh.

764
00:45:33,493 --> 00:45:35,761
What're you doing, Pooh?

765
00:45:35,763 --> 00:45:40,232
Sometimes when I'm going
somewhere and I wait...

766
00:45:40,234 --> 00:45:42,333
a somewhere comes to me.

767
00:45:42,335 --> 00:45:43,402
Right.

768
00:45:43,404 --> 00:45:44,670
Well...

769
00:45:44,672 --> 00:45:46,237
Good luck with everything.

770
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:48,306
I should need good luck.

771
00:45:48,308 --> 00:45:53,045
For I am a bear of
very little brain.

772
00:45:53,047 --> 00:45:56,214
Right. Well, goodbye.

773
00:45:56,216 --> 00:45:58,118
Goodbye.

774
00:46:09,129 --> 00:46:11,565
Look out, Pooh. Here I come.

775
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:18,139
Pooh?

776
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,076
Pooh!

777
00:46:23,277 --> 00:46:24,446
Pooh!

778
00:46:33,553 --> 00:46:35,487
Oh.

779
00:46:35,489 --> 00:46:38,190
So this is what this feels like.

780
00:46:38,192 --> 00:46:39,690
Are you stuck?

781
00:46:39,692 --> 00:46:42,127
Yes, it would appear
that I am stuck.

782
00:46:42,129 --> 00:46:46,065
Happens to me all the time.
Have you just eaten honey?

783
00:46:46,067 --> 00:46:50,505
No, Pooh, I have not
just eaten honey.

784
00:46:56,609 --> 00:46:58,145
Oh, it's still here.

785
00:46:59,413 --> 00:47:02,181
Hundred Acre Wood.

786
00:47:02,183 --> 00:47:04,185
Well, I didn't expect to
be here this morning.

787
00:47:07,721 --> 00:47:09,855
Was it always this gloomy?

788
00:47:09,857 --> 00:47:12,524
I don't believe so.

789
00:47:12,526 --> 00:47:14,659
I wonder where
they all could be.

790
00:47:14,661 --> 00:47:16,594
Well, I was hoping
you would know.

791
00:47:16,596 --> 00:47:18,464
Pooh, I haven't been here in years.
How would I know?

792
00:47:18,466 --> 00:47:20,565
But you're Christopher Robin.

793
00:47:20,567 --> 00:47:22,801
Ah, right. Yes.

794
00:47:22,803 --> 00:47:25,536
Well, the thing is to
do this systematically.

795
00:47:25,538 --> 00:47:28,473
Oh, follow the simple honey bee.

796
00:47:28,475 --> 00:47:30,174
No, Pooh.

797
00:47:30,176 --> 00:47:31,509
The key is to head in
just one direction

798
00:47:31,511 --> 00:47:32,678
to avoid getting lost.

799
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,279
Especially in all this fog.

800
00:47:34,281 --> 00:47:36,448
I always get to
where I'm going...

801
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:39,283
by walking away from
where I have been.

802
00:47:39,285 --> 00:47:40,719
Do you?

803
00:47:40,721 --> 00:47:42,791
That's the way I do it.

804
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:45,290
I'm hungry.

805
00:47:45,292 --> 00:47:46,692
Come on, Pooh.

806
00:47:46,694 --> 00:47:49,361
We'll never get
anywhere at this rate.

807
00:47:55,502 --> 00:47:57,536
Is anything familiar?

808
00:47:57,538 --> 00:48:00,571
The fog. Well, besides the fog.

809
00:48:00,573 --> 00:48:03,442
Oh, bother.

810
00:48:03,444 --> 00:48:05,344
What's the matter?

811
00:48:05,346 --> 00:48:06,911
Oh, Pooh.

812
00:48:06,913 --> 00:48:09,147
You can't be serious.
There's no such thing

813
00:48:09,149 --> 00:48:10,415
as Heffalumps and Woozles.

814
00:48:10,417 --> 00:48:12,216
Of course there are.

815
00:48:12,218 --> 00:48:14,555
Didn't you see the sign?

816
00:48:16,857 --> 00:48:19,658
Pooh, terrifying elephant
and weasel-like beasts...

817
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:22,696
who wander the world preying
on happiness aren't real.

818
00:48:23,564 --> 00:48:25,232
Now, come on.

819
00:48:27,835 --> 00:48:29,634
Christopher?

820
00:48:29,636 --> 00:48:31,569
What do you do?

821
00:48:31,571 --> 00:48:34,605
I'm the Efficiency Manager
at a luggage company.

822
00:48:34,607 --> 00:48:36,741
You must have many
friends there.

823
00:48:36,743 --> 00:48:38,710
There's lots of people
who rely on me.

824
00:48:38,712 --> 00:48:40,379
So, yes.

825
00:48:40,381 --> 00:48:42,281
No, I don't think
of them as friends.

826
00:48:42,283 --> 00:48:45,317
That makes it harder if
I have to let them go.

827
00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:46,817
Where will they go?

828
00:48:46,819 --> 00:48:49,223
- I don't know, Pooh.
- I don't know.

829
00:48:51,859 --> 00:48:53,728
Did you let me go?

830
00:48:58,598 --> 00:49:00,535
I suppose I did.

831
00:49:03,571 --> 00:49:04,772
Come on, Pooh.

832
00:49:14,314 --> 00:49:16,480
Oh. What is that?

833
00:49:16,482 --> 00:49:18,549
It's a compass, from the war.

834
00:49:18,551 --> 00:49:19,853
I still keep it with me.

835
00:49:22,388 --> 00:49:24,755
May I see the compass?

836
00:49:24,757 --> 00:49:26,761
Yes, I suppose so.

837
00:49:28,796 --> 00:49:29,897
Oh.

838
00:49:31,598 --> 00:49:34,333
Shall we follow this
very handy arrow?

839
00:49:34,335 --> 00:49:36,000
Well, that's a very good idea.

840
00:49:36,002 --> 00:49:37,335
No, wait, Pooh.

841
00:49:37,337 --> 00:49:38,737
Keep us headed north.

842
00:49:38,739 --> 00:49:39,874
North.

843
00:49:40,741 --> 00:49:42,641
Oh, north.

844
00:49:42,643 --> 00:49:45,344
Yes, there's an "N" in
front of it, for "north."

845
00:49:45,346 --> 00:49:48,416
That's what that means.

846
00:49:52,919 --> 00:49:55,654
Isn't this the same sign?

847
00:49:55,656 --> 00:49:58,022
Pooh, are you sure we're
still heading north?

848
00:49:58,024 --> 00:49:59,991
Let me look.

849
00:49:59,993 --> 00:50:01,792
You haven't been looking?

850
00:50:01,794 --> 00:50:03,864
Not since I started
following these footsteps.

851
00:50:04,964 --> 00:50:07,399
Pooh, they're our footsteps!

852
00:50:07,401 --> 00:50:10,402
Oh, we've just been going
around in a great, big circle.

853
00:50:10,404 --> 00:50:11,870
What's the matter with you?

854
00:50:11,872 --> 00:50:13,705
All you had to do was
follow the compass!

855
00:50:13,707 --> 00:50:16,341
But it led us to the
Heffalumps and the Woozles.

856
00:50:16,343 --> 00:50:20,279
There are no Heffalumps
and Woozles, do you hear?

857
00:50:20,281 --> 00:50:22,001
Oh, I should never have
trusted you with it!

858
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:25,417
I'm sorry.

859
00:50:25,419 --> 00:50:31,489
I'll put it back in the
holder of important things.

860
00:50:31,491 --> 00:50:34,426
Oh, my papers! They're
irreplaceable!

861
00:50:34,428 --> 00:50:36,060
I shall never remember all this!

862
00:50:36,062 --> 00:50:37,763
Pooh, you're right.

863
00:50:37,765 --> 00:50:39,797
You are a bear of
very little brain.

864
00:50:39,799 --> 00:50:41,433
Do you know what'll happen

865
00:50:41,435 --> 00:50:43,402
if I lose one single
sheet of this?

866
00:50:43,404 --> 00:50:45,504
Winslow will eat
me for breakfast.

867
00:50:45,506 --> 00:50:47,371
A Woozle will eat
you for breakfast?

868
00:50:47,373 --> 00:50:49,908
Yes, a great big Woozle
will gobble me up.

869
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:51,442
That doesn't sound like fun.

870
00:50:51,444 --> 00:50:53,612
That's the real world for you.

871
00:50:53,614 --> 00:50:58,350
Oh, Pooh, there's more to life
than just balloons and honey.

872
00:50:58,352 --> 00:50:59,551
Are you sure?

873
00:50:59,553 --> 00:51:01,018
Silly bear.

874
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:03,321
I don't know why you came back.

875
00:51:03,323 --> 00:51:05,424
I'm not a child anymore.

876
00:51:05,426 --> 00:51:09,493
I'm an adult, with adult
responsibilities.

877
00:51:09,495 --> 00:51:12,499
But you're Christopher Robin.

878
00:51:14,634 --> 00:51:15,900
No.

879
00:51:15,902 --> 00:51:18,672
I'm not how you remember me.

880
00:51:19,473 --> 00:51:21,440
I'm sorry.

881
00:51:21,442 --> 00:51:23,074
You're right.

882
00:51:23,076 --> 00:51:25,777
You should let me go...

883
00:51:25,779 --> 00:51:27,815
for a fish in the sea.

884
00:51:28,982 --> 00:51:31,382
"A fish in the sea?"

885
00:51:31,384 --> 00:51:33,620
No, "efficiency!"

886
00:51:35,888 --> 00:51:37,788
Pooh?

887
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:39,626
Pooh?

888
00:51:41,694 --> 00:51:43,330
Winnie the Pooh?

889
00:51:48,835 --> 00:51:50,935
I haven't got time for this.

890
00:51:50,937 --> 00:51:52,069
Pooh!

891
00:51:52,071 --> 00:51:53,904
Pooh, where are you?

892
00:51:53,906 --> 00:51:56,574
Oh, where have you
gone, you silly bear?

893
00:51:56,576 --> 00:51:58,509
I didn't mean to frighten you.
Pooh!

894
00:51:58,511 --> 00:52:01,712
Tigger, Eeyore, anyone?

895
00:52:03,517 --> 00:52:05,783
There's no such things as
Heffalumps and Woozles.

896
00:52:05,785 --> 00:52:07,621
Oh, not real, not
real, not real.

897
00:52:11,158 --> 00:52:12,656
Not real.

898
00:52:12,658 --> 00:52:14,625
Not real, not real, not real.

899
00:52:23,437 --> 00:52:27,605
Oh, no! No, I'm not a Heffalump!

900
00:52:27,607 --> 00:52:29,507
They're up there!

901
00:52:29,509 --> 00:52:31,810
And I'm down here.

902
00:52:31,812 --> 00:52:34,078
Pooh!

903
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,748
Somebody help!

904
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:38,518
Oh, perfect!

905
00:52:46,093 --> 00:52:49,127
<i>You're the man of the house now.</i>

906
00:52:49,129 --> 00:52:51,196
<i>I haven't seen you
laugh in years.</i>

907
00:52:51,198 --> 00:52:53,130
<i>Dreams don't come for free.</i>

908
00:52:53,132 --> 00:52:54,966
<i>One day you're going to crack.</i>

909
00:52:54,968 --> 00:52:56,801
<i>Nothing comes from nothing.</i>

910
00:52:56,803 --> 00:52:58,536
<i>You need to ask
yourself the question,</i>

911
00:52:58,538 --> 00:53:01,005
<i>"Am I a swimmer,
or am I a sinker?"</i>

912
00:53:05,078 --> 00:53:10,681
Sometimes the thing
to do is nothing.

913
00:53:10,683 --> 00:53:12,085
Ooh.

914
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,663
Oh, no! Christopher.

915
00:53:25,031 --> 00:53:26,063
No!

916
00:53:26,065 --> 00:53:28,703
Come back to us!

917
00:53:32,672 --> 00:53:35,642
Just do nothing!
Just do nothing!

918
00:53:54,093 --> 00:53:55,629
Pooh!

919
00:53:56,562 --> 00:53:57,864
Anyone?

920
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:53,817
Just my luck.

921
00:54:53,819 --> 00:54:55,219
A Heffalump.

922
00:54:55,221 --> 00:54:58,123
Leering at his lunch.

923
00:54:58,125 --> 00:54:59,891
Eeyore, I'm not a Heffalump!

924
00:54:59,893 --> 00:55:03,627
Doesn't matter anyway.
Headed for the waterfall.

925
00:55:03,629 --> 00:55:05,230
I'll be gone soon.

926
00:55:05,232 --> 00:55:08,732
Oh, no, not the waterfall.

927
00:55:08,734 --> 00:55:09,900
Swim!

928
00:55:09,902 --> 00:55:12,103
Not that anyone will notice.

929
00:55:12,105 --> 00:55:13,904
Swim, swim, swim!

930
00:55:13,906 --> 00:55:16,975
Just have to go with the...
Ow. Flow.

931
00:55:16,977 --> 00:55:19,611
Don't worry. I'm not.

932
00:55:19,613 --> 00:55:21,980
Can't change the inevitable.

933
00:55:21,982 --> 00:55:25,016
You mustn't give up, Eeyore!
I'll save you.

934
00:55:25,018 --> 00:55:26,187
We'll see.

935
00:55:30,591 --> 00:55:32,623
Oh, yes, of course. I've
grown up, haven't I?

936
00:55:34,093 --> 00:55:35,259
Oh! Eeyore!

937
00:55:35,261 --> 00:55:38,163
Laughing at my misfortune.

938
00:55:38,165 --> 00:55:40,567
Just like a Heffalump.

939
00:55:43,169 --> 00:55:44,301
Hello, Eeyore.

940
00:55:44,303 --> 00:55:46,103
Hello, Heffalump.

941
00:55:46,105 --> 00:55:49,841
I'm not a Heffalump.
I'm Christopher Robin.

942
00:55:49,843 --> 00:55:52,210
Do you remember, I used
to try and cheer you up?

943
00:55:52,212 --> 00:55:54,279
I don't remember being cheery.

944
00:55:54,281 --> 00:55:56,380
What were you doing
in the water?

945
00:55:56,382 --> 00:56:00,317
Just an average Windsday
morning for me.

946
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:02,687
Woke up. Windy.

947
00:56:02,689 --> 00:56:05,022
Wind blew me into the river.

948
00:56:05,024 --> 00:56:07,158
It must know I can't swim.

949
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:10,661
There's that sound again.

950
00:56:10,663 --> 00:56:15,966
It's your fellow Heffalumps,
calling you home.

951
00:56:15,968 --> 00:56:18,837
Come on, Eeyore. Let's get
to the bottom of this.

952
00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:21,275
I'm already at the bottom.

953
00:56:22,743 --> 00:56:25,112
It's kind of you to kidnap me.

954
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:28,379
Now we're getting somewhere.

955
00:56:28,381 --> 00:56:30,714
Not exactly what I had in mind.

956
00:56:30,716 --> 00:56:32,183
Oh, look, Owl's house
has fallen out

957
00:56:32,185 --> 00:56:33,652
of the tree again.

958
00:56:33,654 --> 00:56:35,219
And there's that terrible noise.

959
00:56:35,221 --> 00:56:38,288
I think it's behind the house.

960
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:40,792
Well, I think we
should investigate.

961
00:56:40,794 --> 00:56:43,828
I wouldn't go in
there if I was us.

962
00:56:45,431 --> 00:56:48,065
There's no such thing
as Heffalumps.

963
00:56:48,067 --> 00:56:49,803
There's no such thing
as Heffalumps.

964
00:56:52,272 --> 00:56:54,275
There's no such...

965
00:56:55,241 --> 00:56:57,074
Look.

966
00:56:57,076 --> 00:56:58,777
It's just the old weather vane.

967
00:56:58,779 --> 00:57:01,679
Great. Now it has a weapon.

968
00:57:01,681 --> 00:57:04,848
No sign of Owl though, either.

969
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:06,850
Wonder what happened.

970
00:57:06,852 --> 00:57:09,187
If only Christopher
Robin were here.

971
00:57:09,189 --> 00:57:11,823
I am Christopher Robin.

972
00:57:11,825 --> 00:57:15,460
You should be able
to tell us then.

973
00:57:18,397 --> 00:57:21,132
Let's see.

974
00:57:21,134 --> 00:57:23,201
Looks like they were all here.

975
00:57:23,203 --> 00:57:25,170
Rabbit...

976
00:57:25,172 --> 00:57:28,005
Oh, someone was bouncing.

977
00:57:28,007 --> 00:57:30,408
Tigger. Looks like a disaster.

978
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:32,310
Why wasn't I invited?

979
00:57:32,312 --> 00:57:33,844
So I think what happened is...

980
00:57:33,846 --> 00:57:35,980
the weather vane broke off

981
00:57:35,982 --> 00:57:37,348
when the house fell
out of the tree...

982
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:39,283
and started making that noise...

983
00:57:39,285 --> 00:57:41,319
and they all thought it was
a Heffalump and panicked.

984
00:57:41,321 --> 00:57:42,853
And then they all...

985
00:57:42,855 --> 00:57:44,691
flew out of the door.

986
00:57:45,459 --> 00:57:47,225
Oh.

987
00:57:47,227 --> 00:57:48,826
Look, haycorn shells. A
whole trail of them.

988
00:57:48,828 --> 00:57:51,029
Follow them and
we'll find Piglet.

989
00:57:51,031 --> 00:57:52,196
Now that is...

990
00:57:55,301 --> 00:57:56,671
I'm sorry, old bean.

991
00:57:57,136 --> 00:57:58,803
Come on.

992
00:57:58,805 --> 00:58:00,739
I was just getting comfortable.

993
00:58:00,741 --> 00:58:02,272
Let's go and see if
we can't find Piglet.

994
00:58:02,274 --> 00:58:04,141
Goodbye, Bucket.

995
00:58:04,143 --> 00:58:05,412
There's one.

996
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,716
And here.

997
00:58:10,116 --> 00:58:11,449
Another one.

998
00:58:11,451 --> 00:58:12,817
You don't have to tell me

999
00:58:12,819 --> 00:58:13,951
every time you pick one up.

1000
00:58:13,953 --> 00:58:15,185
And another...

1001
00:58:21,527 --> 00:58:23,361
Who is it? Who's there?

1002
00:58:23,363 --> 00:58:25,763
It's nobody.

1003
00:58:25,765 --> 00:58:28,232
Oh, Eeyore. Thank
goodness it's you.

1004
00:58:28,234 --> 00:58:30,704
Oh. And a Heffalump.

1005
00:58:34,107 --> 00:58:36,406
Piglet, it's just me.
Christopher Robin.

1006
00:58:36,408 --> 00:58:39,042
Don't move. Don't move, Eeyore.

1007
00:58:39,044 --> 00:58:40,344
Maybe it won't eat us.

1008
00:58:40,346 --> 00:58:42,045
Oh, Piglet.

1009
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:43,982
Would a Heffalump
offer you a haycorn?

1010
00:58:43,984 --> 00:58:46,384
It would if it was
trying to trick me!

1011
00:58:46,386 --> 00:58:47,721
Oh.

1012
00:58:52,024 --> 00:58:53,824
- His legs are so long!
- Piglet!

1013
00:58:53,826 --> 00:58:55,326
I didn't mean to frighten you.
Come on.

1014
00:58:55,328 --> 00:58:57,094
I'm not frightened.
I'm not frightened.

1015
00:58:57,096 --> 00:58:58,498
I'm terrified.

1016
00:59:00,065 --> 00:59:02,065
Got to go quicker.
Got to go quicker.

1017
00:59:02,067 --> 00:59:05,236
These haycorns are weighing
me down, but I can't let go.

1018
00:59:05,238 --> 00:59:07,004
He's coming! It's coming!

1019
00:59:07,006 --> 00:59:08,940
Piglet, you have a
head full of fluff.

1020
00:59:08,942 --> 00:59:11,475
You've led it right to us!
Now we're stuffed!

1021
00:59:11,477 --> 00:59:13,044
What's the point of hiding

1022
00:59:13,046 --> 00:59:14,411
if you're going to
bring him to us?

1023
00:59:14,413 --> 00:59:16,346
- Hello, everyone.
- Nobody move.

1024
00:59:16,348 --> 00:59:19,216
Heffalumps can't see
you if you don't move.

1025
00:59:19,218 --> 00:59:20,819
I can clearly see you.

1026
00:59:20,821 --> 00:59:22,020
Well, you didn't see this.

1027
00:59:22,022 --> 00:59:24,589
I'll pounce ya. I'll pound ya.

1028
00:59:24,591 --> 00:59:27,192
Tigger! It's Christopher Robin.

1029
00:59:27,194 --> 00:59:28,525
Huh? Oh, Tigger, just look.

1030
00:59:28,527 --> 00:59:30,594
Look closely.

1031
00:59:30,596 --> 00:59:34,364
He's giant. Huge!
He's a massive beast.

1032
00:59:34,366 --> 00:59:35,933
And he smells a little funny.

1033
00:59:35,935 --> 00:59:37,167
Don't look him in the eye.

1034
00:59:37,169 --> 00:59:39,971
He has hair everywhere!

1035
00:59:39,973 --> 00:59:41,839
Even in his ears.

1036
00:59:41,841 --> 00:59:43,373
Such troubled eyes.

1037
00:59:43,375 --> 00:59:45,342
- His nose is huge!
- He's hideous.

1038
00:59:45,344 --> 00:59:47,145
Well, that's a bit harsh.

1039
00:59:47,147 --> 00:59:49,080
- He's clearly a Heffalump.
- Don't stare.

1040
00:59:49,082 --> 00:59:51,549
No, the Heffalump was just
your old weather vane, Owl.

1041
00:59:51,551 --> 00:59:53,386
Have you eaten Winnie the Pooh?

1042
00:59:54,321 --> 00:59:55,520
Did they take him?

1043
00:59:55,522 --> 00:59:57,855
Do the monsters have Pooh?

1044
00:59:57,857 --> 01:00:00,257
Look, there's no such
thing as monsters.

1045
01:00:00,259 --> 01:00:02,025
He's tricking us. Of
course there are!

1046
01:00:02,027 --> 01:00:03,527
He lies!

1047
01:00:03,529 --> 01:00:05,096
How dare you pretend to
be Christopher Robin.

1048
01:00:05,098 --> 01:00:06,263
He'd never say such a thing.

1049
01:00:06,265 --> 01:00:07,431
I am Christopher Robin.

1050
01:00:07,433 --> 01:00:08,565
Help me.

1051
01:00:08,567 --> 01:00:10,534
Then prove it.

1052
01:00:10,536 --> 01:00:13,006
Christopher Robin would know
how to stop the Heffalumps.

1053
01:00:16,109 --> 01:00:18,076
You're right, Roo.

1054
01:00:18,078 --> 01:00:19,611
And I'm not gonna let you down.

1055
01:00:19,613 --> 01:00:22,013
We have got a scary
Heffalump here...

1056
01:00:22,015 --> 01:00:23,348
and it's about time I,

1057
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:25,016
Christopher Robin, defeated it.

1058
01:00:25,018 --> 01:00:26,350
So... There!

1059
01:00:26,352 --> 01:00:28,453
There it is!

1060
01:00:28,455 --> 01:00:30,420
Stop, Heffalump!

1061
01:00:30,422 --> 01:00:32,323
Come on, Eeyore.
You'll be my witness.

1062
01:00:32,325 --> 01:00:36,027
Oh, sure. Sacrifice the donkey.

1063
01:00:36,029 --> 01:00:37,594
Let me stand on your back. No!

1064
01:00:37,596 --> 01:00:39,230
Your foot is on my shoulder!
Push me up.

1065
01:00:39,232 --> 01:00:41,065
Up, up, I'm up now.

1066
01:00:41,067 --> 01:00:42,634
I can hear him.

1067
01:00:42,636 --> 01:00:44,469
He's headed to a clearing.

1068
01:00:44,471 --> 01:00:46,337
Sure, I'll just sit here

1069
01:00:46,339 --> 01:00:49,507
while we wait for
them to show up.

1070
01:00:49,509 --> 01:00:50,674
He's drawn his sword.

1071
01:00:50,676 --> 01:00:52,143
What's happening?

1072
01:00:52,145 --> 01:00:53,176
He's just drawn his sword.

1073
01:00:53,178 --> 01:00:54,312
You there!

1074
01:00:54,314 --> 01:00:55,413
Heffalump!

1075
01:00:55,415 --> 01:00:57,214
He's seen it!

1076
01:00:57,216 --> 01:00:58,583
It sounds agitated!
Don't agitate it!

1077
01:00:58,585 --> 01:01:01,222
I'll teach you to
scare my friends!

1078
01:01:03,223 --> 01:01:05,522
But there's nothing there.

1079
01:01:05,524 --> 01:01:07,225
Something is clearly there.
Do you hear that?

1080
01:01:07,227 --> 01:01:08,625
Where's he gone? He's
gone behind the tree!

1081
01:01:08,627 --> 01:01:11,161
Huh?

1082
01:01:11,163 --> 01:01:12,496
Take that, Heffalump!

1083
01:01:12,498 --> 01:01:14,332
He's got me!

1084
01:01:14,334 --> 01:01:16,100
I think the Heffalump's
got him by the foot.

1085
01:01:16,102 --> 01:01:17,301
It's the Heffalump
that's screaming!

1086
01:01:17,303 --> 01:01:19,469
Oh, no! He's attacking me!

1087
01:01:20,973 --> 01:01:22,008
- Huh?
- Oh, no!

1088
01:01:23,475 --> 01:01:24,942
Oh, goodness gripes!

1089
01:01:24,944 --> 01:01:26,046
Hmm...

1090
01:01:28,247 --> 01:01:30,214
Christopher Robin.
They're attacking me!

1091
01:01:30,216 --> 01:01:32,549
It's you. Take that,
you Heffalump!

1092
01:01:32,551 --> 01:01:34,518
Playing again.

1093
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,721
Do you see it, Eeyore?

1094
01:01:36,723 --> 01:01:38,556
I think it's a whole herd.

1095
01:01:38,558 --> 01:01:40,658
They've got us surrounded.

1096
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:42,426
What do they sound like, Eeyore?

1097
01:01:42,428 --> 01:01:44,261
Uh, like this.

1098
01:01:46,399 --> 01:01:48,031
That sound is terrifying!

1099
01:01:48,033 --> 01:01:49,701
Louder, Eeyore, louder!

1100
01:01:49,703 --> 01:01:51,536
It chills my heart.

1101
01:01:51,538 --> 01:01:53,103
That Heffalump's lucky
I'm needed here.

1102
01:01:53,105 --> 01:01:54,272
I'd be bouncing all over it!

1103
01:01:56,241 --> 01:01:58,442
Attack!

1104
01:01:58,444 --> 01:02:01,145
Well done, Eeyore.
Keep up the good work.

1105
01:02:01,147 --> 01:02:02,547
Finally good at something.

1106
01:02:03,649 --> 01:02:05,449
And there goes the tail.

1107
01:02:05,451 --> 01:02:06,583
He's winning, Mum.

1108
01:02:06,585 --> 01:02:08,118
I think you're right, Roo.

1109
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,754
Then it must be
Christopher Robin!

1110
01:02:09,756 --> 01:02:11,089
I can't see what the
Heffalump's doing,

1111
01:02:11,091 --> 01:02:12,522
but it sounds very nasty.

1112
01:02:12,524 --> 01:02:14,759
It all sounds very, very nasty!

1113
01:02:14,761 --> 01:02:16,627
I'm not afraid of you!

1114
01:02:16,629 --> 01:02:19,029
You rotten, stinking Heffalump.

1115
01:02:19,031 --> 01:02:20,364
Go on, Christopher!

1116
01:02:20,366 --> 01:02:21,531
I think he's gonna do it!

1117
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:26,136
There is silence.

1118
01:02:26,138 --> 01:02:28,138
I do not know which
one is standing.

1119
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:31,408
It's not entirely clear.

1120
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:33,076
Something is moving towards us.

1121
01:02:33,078 --> 01:02:35,746
Please, please make it,
Christopher Robin.

1122
01:02:35,748 --> 01:02:38,382
Did he win? Mummy, tell
me what's going on.

1123
01:02:38,384 --> 01:02:40,083
Something's coming.

1124
01:02:40,085 --> 01:02:41,351
Can you see him?
Yes, I can see him.

1125
01:02:41,353 --> 01:02:42,687
How does he look?

1126
01:02:42,689 --> 01:02:44,522
Smaller, getting larger.

1127
01:02:44,524 --> 01:02:45,723
- Christopher Robin!
- It's Christopher Robin!

1128
01:02:45,725 --> 01:02:47,525
- He's won!
- He did it!

1129
01:02:47,527 --> 01:02:49,226
I have vanquished the Heffalump.

1130
01:02:49,228 --> 01:02:50,495
Well, of course, we
all knew really!

1131
01:02:50,497 --> 01:02:52,562
We knew you'd dump that lump.

1132
01:02:52,564 --> 01:02:53,797
Only Christopher Robin
can beat a Heffalump!

1133
01:02:53,799 --> 01:02:55,533
I never lost hope.

1134
01:02:55,535 --> 01:02:56,466
We missed you! I've
missed you, too.

1135
01:02:56,468 --> 01:02:58,069
All of you.

1136
01:02:58,071 --> 01:02:59,203
Very much.

1137
01:02:59,205 --> 01:03:01,406
Oh, you've grown up well.

1138
01:03:01,408 --> 01:03:03,641
So glad we're all
back together again.

1139
01:03:03,643 --> 01:03:05,475
But where's Pooh?

1140
01:03:05,477 --> 01:03:08,047
Oh, yes, of course, Piglet.
Well, Pooh...

1141
01:03:08,781 --> 01:03:10,580
I lost him.

1142
01:03:10,582 --> 01:03:12,150
- He's lost him?
- Oh, dear.

1143
01:03:12,152 --> 01:03:13,717
Where exactly did you lose him?

1144
01:03:13,719 --> 01:03:15,553
Concentrate. Let's all
work together, please.

1145
01:03:15,555 --> 01:03:18,156
I'll get searching. Tiggers
are the best searchers.

1146
01:03:18,158 --> 01:03:20,824
You're Christopher Robin.
You'll find him.

1147
01:03:20,826 --> 01:03:22,196
Somewhere.

1148
01:03:23,163 --> 01:03:24,728
Somewhere.

1149
01:03:24,730 --> 01:03:26,431
Well, that's it, Roo.

1150
01:03:26,433 --> 01:03:28,565
Pooh's waiting for
Somewhere to find him.

1151
01:03:28,567 --> 01:03:31,504
And I think I know just
where Somewhere is.

1152
01:03:39,245 --> 01:03:41,312
There he is.

1153
01:03:41,314 --> 01:03:43,149
Waiting for you.

1154
01:04:06,105 --> 01:04:07,871
Hello, Pooh.

1155
01:04:07,873 --> 01:04:10,576
Hello, Christopher Robin.

1156
01:04:13,446 --> 01:04:16,746
I'm so sorry, Pooh. I'm
so terribly sorry.

1157
01:04:16,748 --> 01:04:19,216
I should never have
shouted at you.

1158
01:04:19,218 --> 01:04:23,187
Well, I am a bear of
very little brain.

1159
01:04:23,189 --> 01:04:25,422
No, Pooh.

1160
01:04:25,424 --> 01:04:29,395
You are, I think, a
bear of very big heart.

1161
01:04:30,163 --> 01:04:32,362
Hmm.

1162
01:04:32,364 --> 01:04:35,399
You'll be happy to hear that
everyone's safe and sound.

1163
01:04:35,401 --> 01:04:39,270
I saved them from a Heffalump
which was, in fact, well, me.

1164
01:04:39,272 --> 01:04:40,737
And Owl's weather vane.

1165
01:04:40,739 --> 01:04:43,440
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

1166
01:04:43,442 --> 01:04:47,645
But I am rather glad
that I was here.

1167
01:04:47,647 --> 01:04:49,683
Waiting for you.

1168
01:04:51,683 --> 01:04:54,451
Thank you for waiting
for me, Pooh.

1169
01:04:54,453 --> 01:04:56,721
It's always a sunny day...

1170
01:04:56,723 --> 01:04:59,656
when Christopher
Robin comes to play.

1171
01:04:59,658 --> 01:05:00,693
Hmm.

1172
01:05:02,594 --> 01:05:04,832
Not so sure about that.

1173
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,199
I'm not who I used to be.

1174
01:05:09,201 --> 01:05:10,634
Of course you are.

1175
01:05:10,636 --> 01:05:12,502
You're our friend.

1176
01:05:12,504 --> 01:05:15,705
Look at how you saved
everybody today.

1177
01:05:15,707 --> 01:05:18,842
You are our hero.

1178
01:05:18,844 --> 01:05:21,281
I'm not a hero, Pooh.

1179
01:05:22,614 --> 01:05:24,681
I'm lost.

1180
01:05:24,683 --> 01:05:27,451
But I found you.

1181
01:05:27,453 --> 01:05:29,189
Didn't I?

1182
01:05:51,477 --> 01:05:55,946
You're squashing me again.

1183
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:03,286
May we wake them?

1184
01:06:06,826 --> 01:06:08,725
Pooh. Pooh!

1185
01:06:08,727 --> 01:06:10,263
It's me, Piglet.

1186
01:06:12,497 --> 01:06:14,734
- Wakey, wakey.
- Good morning, Piglet.

1187
01:06:19,339 --> 01:06:21,806
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1188
01:06:21,808 --> 01:06:24,275
What is it? It's tomorrow!

1189
01:06:24,277 --> 01:06:25,775
It's usually today.

1190
01:06:25,777 --> 01:06:27,911
Well, yes, of course it's today.

1191
01:06:27,913 --> 01:06:29,614
But that means I slept here,

1192
01:06:29,616 --> 01:06:31,848
and I'm meant to be
in the office in...

1193
01:06:31,850 --> 01:06:33,650
Oh, blast! How did
I let this happen?

1194
01:06:33,652 --> 01:06:35,353
He's overslept!
Where's my briefcase?

1195
01:06:35,355 --> 01:06:36,953
Owl, you've been up all night.

1196
01:06:36,955 --> 01:06:38,955
- You should've squawked!
- Don't you worry.

1197
01:06:38,957 --> 01:06:41,658
As my old Uncle Orville
used to say...

1198
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:44,795
"Worry is the way to concern."

1199
01:06:44,797 --> 01:06:48,031
Or is it, "Concern is
the way to confusion?"

1200
01:06:48,033 --> 01:06:49,900
You're the way to confusion.

1201
01:06:49,902 --> 01:06:51,902
We've got all your belongings
all nice and dried out.

1202
01:06:51,904 --> 01:06:53,670
Tigger helped me get
you all sorted.

1203
01:06:53,672 --> 01:06:55,538
I sure did.

1204
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:57,574
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

1205
01:06:57,576 --> 01:06:59,944
I could never have forgotten
my case of important things.

1206
01:06:59,946 --> 01:07:01,511
I'm sorry I have to go,

1207
01:07:01,513 --> 01:07:02,980
but I've already
stayed far too long.

1208
01:07:02,982 --> 01:07:05,516
Oh, Pooh, you should keep this.

1209
01:07:05,518 --> 01:07:06,984
That way, if you lose someone,

1210
01:07:06,986 --> 01:07:08,853
you'll be able to
find them again.

1211
01:07:08,855 --> 01:07:11,721
Thank you, Christopher Robin.

1212
01:07:11,723 --> 01:07:13,857
Oh, and you should take this.

1213
01:07:13,859 --> 01:07:15,493
For Madeline.

1214
01:07:15,495 --> 01:07:17,460
What's a Madeline?

1215
01:07:17,462 --> 01:07:20,765
Is it more important than your
case of important things?

1216
01:07:20,767 --> 01:07:23,768
Madeline's my daughter,
so, yes, of course.

1217
01:07:23,770 --> 01:07:27,538
Absolutely. She means
the world to me.

1218
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:30,344
Then why isn't she with you?

1219
01:07:31,643 --> 01:07:32,810
Well, uh...

1220
01:07:32,812 --> 01:07:34,745
She has work to do, Roo.

1221
01:07:34,747 --> 01:07:37,380
- Oh, the poor dear.
- No, no.

1222
01:07:37,382 --> 01:07:39,419
She likes work.

1223
01:07:40,553 --> 01:07:41,752
Uh...

1224
01:07:41,754 --> 01:07:43,587
Look, I've got to hurry.

1225
01:07:43,589 --> 01:07:44,989
Goodbye, everyone.

1226
01:07:44,991 --> 01:07:46,056
It's so nice to see
you all again.

1227
01:07:46,058 --> 01:07:47,761
Goodbye, Christopher.

1228
01:07:48,794 --> 01:07:49,863
Goodbye!

1229
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:28,700
Father?

1230
01:08:29,736 --> 01:08:31,872
Father, is that you?

1231
01:08:33,572 --> 01:08:34,637
Yes.

1232
01:08:34,639 --> 01:08:36,606
What are you doing here?

1233
01:08:36,608 --> 01:08:38,642
Well, uh...

1234
01:08:38,644 --> 01:08:40,744
I was, uh...

1235
01:08:40,746 --> 01:08:42,812
Were you in the woods?

1236
01:08:42,814 --> 01:08:44,682
Yes, I was.

1237
01:08:44,684 --> 01:08:45,852
But I'm terribly sorry...

1238
01:08:47,787 --> 01:08:48,787
Hello.

1239
01:08:49,921 --> 01:08:51,724
I've really got to go.

1240
01:08:52,925 --> 01:08:54,691
You can't stay?

1241
01:08:54,693 --> 01:08:56,427
I can't, darling.

1242
01:08:56,429 --> 01:08:58,027
There's an 11:00 meeting
I'm terribly late for.

1243
01:08:58,029 --> 01:08:59,765
I'm so sorry. Madeline?

1244
01:09:00,867 --> 01:09:03,167
Madeline?

1245
01:09:03,169 --> 01:09:05,402
Oh, gosh.

1246
01:09:05,404 --> 01:09:07,103
I'm sorry, darling. I never
meant for her to see me.

1247
01:09:07,105 --> 01:09:08,672
I've really got to
make the next train.

1248
01:09:08,674 --> 01:09:10,708
Well, you better go then.

1249
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:12,642
There's a good explanation
for all of this.

1250
01:09:12,644 --> 01:09:14,677
I'd love to hear it.

1251
01:09:14,679 --> 01:09:16,982
Well, I was...

1252
01:09:18,483 --> 01:09:19,950
Well, it's a little complicated.

1253
01:09:19,952 --> 01:09:24,120
I suppose I can't right now.

1254
01:09:24,122 --> 01:09:27,458
I was thinking that Madeline
and I should stay longer.

1255
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:29,560
Do you think that's
really for the best?

1256
01:09:29,562 --> 01:09:31,061
I do.

1257
01:09:31,063 --> 01:09:32,866
For how long? I don't
know, Christopher.

1258
01:09:33,599 --> 01:09:34,964
Evelyn!

1259
01:09:34,966 --> 01:09:36,246
You're going to miss your train.

1260
01:09:59,724 --> 01:10:01,459
How's it going in here?

1261
01:10:01,461 --> 01:10:04,498
Fine. Wonderful.
Everything's just perfect!

1262
01:10:05,564 --> 01:10:07,401
Yeah, I can see that.

1263
01:10:20,545 --> 01:10:25,182
It's hard to imagine your
father as a child, isn't it?

1264
01:10:25,184 --> 01:10:27,116
Are you sure he ever was one?

1265
01:10:27,118 --> 01:10:28,619
Yeah, I'm sure.

1266
01:10:28,621 --> 01:10:31,725
Well, I'm pretty sure.

1267
01:10:36,862 --> 01:10:39,963
I'm sorry he couldn't stay.

1268
01:10:39,965 --> 01:10:42,932
Your father...

1269
01:10:42,934 --> 01:10:46,270
He's having a bit of
a hard time of it.

1270
01:10:46,272 --> 01:10:48,806
Then he should have come and
spent the weekend with us.

1271
01:10:48,808 --> 01:10:50,740
We would've made
him feel better.

1272
01:10:50,742 --> 01:10:54,210
It's not always that simple.

1273
01:10:54,212 --> 01:10:56,550
He will come back to us, though.

1274
01:10:57,582 --> 01:10:59,115
I know it.

1275
01:10:59,117 --> 01:11:02,218
Boarding school starts soon.

1276
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:04,825
There's not a lot of time left.

1277
01:11:09,629 --> 01:11:13,466
That's why you
should go and play.

1278
01:11:14,567 --> 01:11:16,267
Play? Yes.

1279
01:11:16,269 --> 01:11:17,901
Dirty, mucky play.

1280
01:11:17,903 --> 01:11:19,736
I expect you to
come back filthy.

1281
01:11:23,075 --> 01:11:25,743
Yes. I'm going to play
better and harder

1282
01:11:25,745 --> 01:11:28,012
than any child has
ever played before.

1283
01:11:28,014 --> 01:11:30,313
Or, you know, have fun.

1284
01:11:30,315 --> 01:11:32,883
Right. Fun.

1285
01:11:32,885 --> 01:11:35,619
How exactly do I do that?

1286
01:11:35,621 --> 01:11:37,922
Go explore. I'm sure
your father found

1287
01:11:37,924 --> 01:11:39,222
loads of things to play
with around here...

1288
01:11:39,224 --> 01:11:40,826
when he was your age.

1289
01:11:43,696 --> 01:11:46,797
I don't feel much
like Pooh today.

1290
01:11:46,799 --> 01:11:50,200
There, there, I'll bring you
tea and honey until you do.

1291
01:11:50,202 --> 01:11:52,069
Hmm, that's an idea, Piglet.

1292
01:11:52,071 --> 01:11:54,170
One Tigger-knot coming right up.

1293
01:11:54,172 --> 01:11:55,573
This is the crucial part.

1294
01:11:55,575 --> 01:11:57,141
It's too tight.

1295
01:11:57,143 --> 01:12:00,878
Eeyore, you've got a,
um, a something...

1296
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,178
on your back.

1297
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:04,013
Rain protection.

1298
01:12:04,015 --> 01:12:06,249
- What do you think?
- I know what I think.

1299
01:12:06,251 --> 01:12:10,020
But those are Christopher
Robin's important papers.

1300
01:12:10,022 --> 01:12:12,121
Oh, Tigger, what
have you done now?

1301
01:12:12,123 --> 01:12:14,857
Well, I needed to make
room in his briefcase

1302
01:12:14,859 --> 01:12:16,293
for the real important stuff.

1303
01:12:16,295 --> 01:12:18,896
You know, things
to remember us by.

1304
01:12:18,898 --> 01:12:20,897
Not the flippity-flop papers.

1305
01:12:20,899 --> 01:12:23,601
But without them, the Woozles
will eat him for breakfast.

1306
01:12:23,603 --> 01:12:25,002
Oh, no!

1307
01:12:25,004 --> 01:12:26,805
Pooh, what do we do?

1308
01:12:38,384 --> 01:12:39,850
Tree.

1309
01:12:39,852 --> 01:12:41,854
Sheep.

1310
01:12:42,621 --> 01:12:44,355
Cow.

1311
01:12:44,357 --> 01:12:46,356
Woman with dog.

1312
01:13:03,274 --> 01:13:04,877
Tree.

1313
01:13:06,345 --> 01:13:07,981
Sheep.

1314
01:13:09,081 --> 01:13:10,216
Cow.

1315
01:13:11,916 --> 01:13:13,118
Bridge.

1316
01:13:17,922 --> 01:13:19,789
Is it all tied up
nice and tight?

1317
01:13:19,791 --> 01:13:21,959
Well, of course! I
used a Tigger-knot.

1318
01:13:21,961 --> 01:13:23,994
The strongest knot known.

1319
01:13:23,996 --> 01:13:26,195
Does this make me look husky?

1320
01:13:26,197 --> 01:13:28,298
You look like a sad house.

1321
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:31,267
Pooh, are you sure we
need to go to Lon Don?

1322
01:13:31,269 --> 01:13:33,137
Oh, yes, Piglet.

1323
01:13:33,139 --> 01:13:35,705
Christopher Robin always
comes to save us.

1324
01:13:35,707 --> 01:13:37,307
Now, it's our turn to save him.

1325
01:13:37,309 --> 01:13:39,410
We're probably too late.

1326
01:13:39,412 --> 01:13:41,878
I'd say they've
eaten him already.

1327
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:44,448
Come on, then! Bounce
faster, Eeyore.

1328
01:13:44,450 --> 01:13:45,949
We've gotta get this
to Christopher Robin.

1329
01:13:45,951 --> 01:13:47,316
I've only got one speed.

1330
01:13:47,318 --> 01:13:48,951
We're right behind you, Tigger.

1331
01:13:48,953 --> 01:13:51,054
I'm not sure I'm going to go.

1332
01:13:51,056 --> 01:13:53,089
No, I think I might stay.

1333
01:13:53,091 --> 01:13:55,325
I'm actually going
to definitely stay.

1334
01:13:55,327 --> 01:13:58,861
There, there, Piglet.
Come on. Here.

1335
01:13:58,863 --> 01:14:00,463
Oh. We need you.

1336
01:14:00,465 --> 01:14:02,165
You need me?

1337
01:14:02,167 --> 01:14:03,299
Um...

1338
01:14:03,301 --> 01:14:05,201
Well, if you need me...

1339
01:14:05,203 --> 01:14:08,038
We always need you, Piglet.

1340
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,440
Thank you, Pooh.

1341
01:14:09,442 --> 01:14:11,709
And wait till you see London.

1342
01:14:11,711 --> 01:14:14,210
So many balloons.

1343
01:14:14,212 --> 01:14:17,948
It's Madeline Robin serving
for the Wimbledon title.

1344
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:21,185
And it's an ace! She's won!

1345
01:14:21,187 --> 01:14:24,154
The crowd goes wild!

1346
01:14:24,156 --> 01:14:25,856
Hip hip hooray!

1347
01:14:25,858 --> 01:14:28,057
- Hip hip hooray!
- The crowd goes wild!

1348
01:14:28,059 --> 01:14:29,359
Which way is Wimbledon?

1349
01:14:29,361 --> 01:14:30,793
Shh! Be quiet.

1350
01:14:30,795 --> 01:14:32,228
What do you mean, "shh?"

1351
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:33,996
Hello?

1352
01:14:33,998 --> 01:14:36,736
- That's a Madeline.
- Oh.

1353
01:14:39,004 --> 01:14:41,271
You're crushing the papers.

1354
01:14:41,273 --> 01:14:43,039
- Hello?
- Uh-oh.

1355
01:14:43,041 --> 01:14:44,274
She doesn't know we're here.

1356
01:14:44,276 --> 01:14:45,310
Quiet, Piglet.

1357
01:14:46,946 --> 01:14:48,344
- Ow.
- Oh, she's very good.

1358
01:14:48,346 --> 01:14:50,884
- Who's in there?
- Throw it back.

1359
01:14:54,185 --> 01:14:55,352
No pushing. We might fall...

1360
01:14:55,354 --> 01:14:56,419
Okay, easy. Tail...

1361
01:15:02,894 --> 01:15:04,427
Oh, hello!

1362
01:15:04,429 --> 01:15:06,530
Congratulations on Wimbledon.

1363
01:15:06,532 --> 01:15:08,531
You must be a Madeline.

1364
01:15:08,533 --> 01:15:11,067
Oh! Danger!

1365
01:15:11,069 --> 01:15:12,969
I'm ever so sorry.

1366
01:15:12,971 --> 01:15:15,011
We're sorry. We didn't mean
to interrupt your games.

1367
01:15:19,245 --> 01:15:21,177
You're talking.

1368
01:15:21,179 --> 01:15:24,347
Me? No, I'm not talking.

1369
01:15:24,349 --> 01:15:26,950
Oh, well, I am now, I suppose.

1370
01:15:26,952 --> 01:15:28,988
Wait. I recognize you.

1371
01:15:30,989 --> 01:15:33,323
You're the bear in my
father's drawings.

1372
01:15:33,325 --> 01:15:35,124
Winnie the Pooh.

1373
01:15:35,126 --> 01:15:36,459
Pooh for short.

1374
01:15:36,461 --> 01:15:38,262
This is Piglet.

1375
01:15:38,264 --> 01:15:41,030
- Eeyore...
- Wait for me!

1376
01:15:43,335 --> 01:15:44,868
Oh, dear.

1377
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:47,471
And I'm Tigger,
T-I-double G-UHR!

1378
01:15:47,473 --> 01:15:48,871
What's a Tigger?

1379
01:15:48,873 --> 01:15:50,106
I'm glad you asked.

1380
01:15:51,477 --> 01:15:53,276
Please, not the song.

1381
01:15:53,278 --> 01:15:55,012
<i>♪ The wonderful
thing about Tiggers</i>

1382
01:15:55,014 --> 01:15:56,579

1389
01:16:07,926 --> 01:16:09,426
He does that a lot.

1390
01:16:09,428 --> 01:16:10,994
I'm the only one.

1391
01:16:10,996 --> 01:16:12,862
Well, hello, everyone.

1392
01:16:12,864 --> 01:16:15,399
Did the red balloon
make you happy?

1393
01:16:15,401 --> 01:16:18,171
Balloons make me very happy.

1394
01:16:20,171 --> 01:16:22,039
- That was from you?
- No.

1395
01:16:22,041 --> 01:16:24,106
It was from Christopher Robin.

1396
01:16:24,108 --> 01:16:25,374
My father was with you?

1397
01:16:25,376 --> 01:16:27,043
Oh, yes.

1398
01:16:27,045 --> 01:16:28,579
He was helping me
to find my friends.

1399
01:16:28,581 --> 01:16:30,614
And he saved us
from the Heffalump.

1400
01:16:30,616 --> 01:16:32,182
A Heffa-what?

1401
01:16:32,184 --> 01:16:33,984
But he left his
important papers...

1402
01:16:33,986 --> 01:16:36,352
which might have been
a smidge my fault.

1403
01:16:36,354 --> 01:16:38,120
It was your fault.

1404
01:16:38,122 --> 01:16:40,356
So we're going on an
expotition to Lon Don.

1405
01:16:40,358 --> 01:16:42,325
Oh.

1406
01:16:42,327 --> 01:16:44,061
If we don't get the
papers to him...

1407
01:16:44,063 --> 01:16:47,263
a Woozle is going to
eat him for breakfast.

1408
01:16:47,265 --> 01:16:48,865
A Woozle...

1409
01:16:48,867 --> 01:16:50,334
You must mean a Winslow.

1410
01:16:50,336 --> 01:16:52,268
Exactly. A Woozle.

1411
01:16:52,270 --> 01:16:54,605
He's going to be awfully
glad to get them back.

1412
01:16:55,940 --> 01:16:57,574
Come on, let's bounce!

1413
01:16:57,576 --> 01:16:59,109
We haven't got a moment to lose.

1414
01:16:59,111 --> 01:17:00,878
Which way do we go?

1415
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:04,981
Christopher Robin said
we should head north.

1416
01:17:04,983 --> 01:17:08,185
London's northwest actually.

1417
01:17:08,187 --> 01:17:10,320
The train station is south.

1418
01:17:10,322 --> 01:17:12,222
I don't know south.

1419
01:17:12,224 --> 01:17:14,892
Don't worry, I do.

1420
01:17:14,894 --> 01:17:16,259
<i>On an expotition
to father's work,</i>

1421
01:17:16,261 --> 01:17:17,596
<i>got his papers. Be back soon.</i>

1422
01:17:21,032 --> 01:17:22,231
I'm going to close my eyes.

1423
01:17:22,233 --> 01:17:23,967
Pretty quickity-quick.

1424
01:17:23,969 --> 01:17:25,468
This is faster than
most expotitions.

1425
01:17:25,470 --> 01:17:27,404
Nice to feel the
wind in your fur.

1426
01:17:27,406 --> 01:17:29,138
Come on, Madeline.

1427
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:30,420
Let's see what
this thing can do.

1428
01:17:31,210 --> 01:17:32,910
Maddy!

1429
01:17:32,912 --> 01:17:35,415
Maddy, would you
like some lemonade?

1430
01:17:46,058 --> 01:17:47,557
Remember "Naptime."

1431
01:17:47,559 --> 01:17:49,226
Tiggers make the best nappers.

1432
01:17:49,228 --> 01:17:50,494
One ticket to London, please.

1433
01:17:50,496 --> 01:17:52,228
Five shillings, please.

1434
01:17:52,230 --> 01:17:55,231
Oh. Right where I belong.

1435
01:17:55,233 --> 01:17:56,368
Grand.

1436
01:17:58,304 --> 01:18:00,169
Thank you! Thank you!

1437
01:18:00,171 --> 01:18:01,538
Thank you.

1438
01:18:09,415 --> 01:18:12,452
Stand clear for the
departing train.

1439
01:18:20,725 --> 01:18:23,462
Does this world ever slow down?

1440
01:18:24,697 --> 01:18:27,698
Play "Naptime." Play "Naptime."

1441
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:29,432
Hello, Miss. Hello.

1442
01:18:29,434 --> 01:18:31,601
Can I get you anything
from the trolley?

1443
01:18:31,603 --> 01:18:34,737
Um, I'd like five
cups of tea, please.

1444
01:18:34,739 --> 01:18:36,539
Of course!

1445
01:18:36,541 --> 01:18:38,709
And some milk, and sugar...

1446
01:18:38,711 --> 01:18:41,011
And honey.

1447
01:18:41,013 --> 01:18:43,382
Honey, please. Lots of honey.

1448
01:18:52,424 --> 01:18:54,591
And the game is called,
"Say What You See."

1449
01:18:54,593 --> 01:18:56,258
You first, Piglet.

1450
01:18:56,260 --> 01:18:58,427
Panic. Worry.

1451
01:18:58,429 --> 01:19:00,097
Catastrophe.

1452
01:19:00,099 --> 01:19:02,732
Speed! Danger! Recklessness!

1453
01:19:02,734 --> 01:19:06,369
- Disgrace. Shame. Humiliation.
- Oh. Ooh.

1454
01:19:06,371 --> 01:19:08,170
Well, that's one way to play it.

1455
01:19:08,172 --> 01:19:09,606
There's going to be no fun

1456
01:19:09,608 --> 01:19:12,008
like this at boarding
school, Pooh.

1457
01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:16,679
Oh. Why not just not
go to boring school?

1458
01:19:16,681 --> 01:19:18,615
If I can get these
papers to Father...

1459
01:19:18,617 --> 01:19:23,052
then maybe he'll be so happy
that he won't make me go.

1460
01:19:23,054 --> 01:19:25,187
Dreams don't come
for free, Pooh.

1461
01:19:25,189 --> 01:19:27,057
You've got to fight for them.

1462
01:19:27,059 --> 01:19:29,191
Nothing comes from nothing.

1463
01:19:29,193 --> 01:19:31,128
Oh, yes.

1464
01:19:31,130 --> 01:19:34,263
Doing nothing often leads
to the very best something.

1465
01:19:34,265 --> 01:19:36,499
What? Who told you that?

1466
01:19:36,501 --> 01:19:38,668
Christopher Robin.

1467
01:19:38,670 --> 01:19:40,736
That doesn't sound like Father.

1468
01:19:40,738 --> 01:19:43,039
He also said that your happiness

1469
01:19:43,041 --> 01:19:45,174
means the world to him.

1470
01:19:45,176 --> 01:19:46,575
He sure did.

1471
01:19:46,577 --> 01:19:48,044
That's right.

1472
01:19:48,046 --> 01:19:49,047
- He said that.
- Mmm-hmm.

1473
01:19:55,621 --> 01:19:57,087
Hold the lift, please.

1474
01:19:57,089 --> 01:19:58,254
Yes, sir.

1475
01:19:58,256 --> 01:19:59,655
Ah, thank you.

1476
01:19:59,657 --> 01:20:01,424
Ah, ready for the
presentation, Robin?

1477
01:20:01,426 --> 01:20:02,392
Ah, yes. It's all in here, sir.

1478
01:20:02,394 --> 01:20:03,463
Hmm.

1479
01:20:10,536 --> 01:20:13,270
Well, see you on
the dance floor.

1480
01:20:13,272 --> 01:20:14,439
We're all counting on you.

1481
01:20:34,259 --> 01:20:36,226
Who are these people?

1482
01:20:36,228 --> 01:20:37,360
Oh, it's so loud!

1483
01:20:37,362 --> 01:20:39,663
Welcome to Lon Don.

1484
01:20:39,665 --> 01:20:41,630
How come nobody's bouncing?

1485
01:20:51,676 --> 01:20:54,177
Winslow Luggage, please.

1486
01:20:54,179 --> 01:20:55,579
On Torrington Street.

1487
01:20:55,581 --> 01:20:57,350
Whatever you say, guv'nah.

1488
01:21:00,419 --> 01:21:02,119
Where are you, Maddy?

1489
01:21:20,238 --> 01:21:22,371
Come on, mate. I
haven't got all day.

1490
01:21:22,373 --> 01:21:23,807
I'm not doing this
for fun, you know?

1491
01:21:23,809 --> 01:21:25,374
Hey, what the...?

1492
01:21:25,376 --> 01:21:26,676
There's a Tigger
looking right at me.

1493
01:21:26,678 --> 01:21:28,477
But I'm the only one!

1494
01:21:28,479 --> 01:21:30,280
What are you doing?
Tigger, be quiet.

1495
01:21:30,282 --> 01:21:32,716
I just saw the most
preposterous imposterator.

1496
01:21:32,718 --> 01:21:34,153
- Tigger.
- What's that, love?

1497
01:21:34,886 --> 01:21:36,753
Oh. Nothing.

1498
01:21:36,755 --> 01:21:38,621
I'm just talking to my teddies.

1499
01:21:38,623 --> 01:21:40,723
There's another one!
Look at him.

1500
01:21:40,725 --> 01:21:42,691
His eyes are too close together.

1501
01:21:42,693 --> 01:21:45,794
Look at his big, silly nose,
and his flippy-floppy ears.

1502
01:21:45,796 --> 01:21:47,230
That's not very nappy.

1503
01:21:47,232 --> 01:21:48,468
Look at that silly stripe.

1504
01:21:49,867 --> 01:21:51,336
Imposterator!

1505
01:21:52,737 --> 01:21:54,471
Calm down.

1506
01:21:54,473 --> 01:21:56,606
Now is not the time for
napping, Madeline.

1507
01:21:56,608 --> 01:21:57,807
I wanna look him
straight in the eye.

1508
01:21:57,809 --> 01:21:59,176
Oh, he's not stopping!

1509
01:21:59,178 --> 01:22:00,677
No, he won't.

1510
01:22:00,679 --> 01:22:03,379
My kinda speed!
Follow that Tigger!

1511
01:22:04,715 --> 01:22:05,915
You're losing him!

1512
01:22:12,190 --> 01:22:13,890
Perfect! You exploded him!

1513
01:22:13,892 --> 01:22:15,424
Good morning.

1514
01:22:15,426 --> 01:22:17,293
Thank you for the ride.

1515
01:22:17,295 --> 01:22:18,794
- Is everyone all right?
- Cheese and crackers.

1516
01:22:18,796 --> 01:22:21,231
My neck, my back! I
can't feel my toes.

1517
01:22:21,233 --> 01:22:23,533
That was so much fun!
Let's do it again!

1518
01:22:23,535 --> 01:22:25,235
Marvelous, mate.

1519
01:22:25,237 --> 01:22:26,735
Oh, thank you very much indeed.

1520
01:22:26,737 --> 01:22:28,871
That's fantastic. This
is my livelihood!

1521
01:22:28,873 --> 01:22:31,307
What in the blue blazes
is going on here?

1522
01:22:31,309 --> 01:22:32,808
Officer, thank
goodness you're here.

1523
01:22:32,810 --> 01:22:34,677
I don't think we played
"Naptime" very well.

1524
01:22:34,679 --> 01:22:36,579
You need to arrest
this lot here.

1525
01:22:36,581 --> 01:22:38,315
Immediately.

1526
01:22:38,317 --> 01:22:39,816
What? This little girl
with her stuffed animals

1527
01:22:39,818 --> 01:22:41,750
is givin' you the fear, is she?

1528
01:22:41,752 --> 01:22:43,485
No, no, there's something
strange going on with them.

1529
01:22:43,487 --> 01:22:45,387
Something spooky.

1530
01:22:45,389 --> 01:22:46,890
Are you on the lemonade, mate?

1531
01:22:46,892 --> 01:22:48,991
Madeline, look!

1532
01:22:48,993 --> 01:22:51,561
Doesn't that say "Woozle?"

1533
01:22:51,563 --> 01:22:52,628
What are you incinerating?

1534
01:22:52,630 --> 01:22:54,463
Incinerating?

1535
01:22:54,465 --> 01:22:56,365
Yeah, what are you
incinerating about me?

1536
01:22:56,367 --> 01:22:57,400
No, no, I think you've
got the wrong word.

1537
01:22:57,402 --> 01:22:58,301
Excuse me. Officer?

1538
01:22:58,303 --> 01:22:59,703
Yes, my darling?

1539
01:22:59,705 --> 01:23:01,538
That's my father there.

1540
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:03,606
Okay, well, off you pop.

1541
01:23:03,608 --> 01:23:04,841
And be careful.

1542
01:23:04,843 --> 01:23:06,375
I will. Thank you, Officer.

1543
01:23:06,377 --> 01:23:08,244
Thank you. Thank you, orifice.

1544
01:23:08,246 --> 01:23:09,878
What a nice man.

1545
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:11,714
Here's me cabbie license.
You don't believe me?

1546
01:23:11,716 --> 01:23:14,918
That is a certificate
of excellent...

1547
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:16,820
There's that face.
I did that face.

1548
01:23:16,822 --> 01:23:18,254
You seen him.

1549
01:23:18,256 --> 01:23:19,856
You saw, didn't you? You saw.

1550
01:23:19,858 --> 01:23:22,491
You have witnessed the
peculiarity, haven't ya?

1551
01:23:22,493 --> 01:23:23,927
What did we see?

1552
01:23:23,929 --> 01:23:25,527
The bear talking.
Little teddy bear.

1553
01:23:25,529 --> 01:23:27,463
No, you didn't. You
saw no such thing.

1554
01:23:27,465 --> 01:23:29,266
- Talking.
- No, it was not.

1555
01:23:29,268 --> 01:23:30,866
It was. That's right,
write it down.

1556
01:23:30,868 --> 01:23:32,535
It wasn't. We misheard it.
There was a pig as well.

1557
01:23:32,537 --> 01:23:34,017
There was a pig. It
was a talking pig.

1558
01:23:37,376 --> 01:23:39,276
As you were.

1559
01:23:39,278 --> 01:23:41,811
Right, we all know
why we're here.

1560
01:23:41,813 --> 01:23:45,414
No one wants to see the
Winslow Luggage ship sink...

1561
01:23:45,416 --> 01:23:48,618
so hard decisions must be made.

1562
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:50,786
Now, Robin and I
worked tirelessly

1563
01:23:50,788 --> 01:23:52,521
the whole weekend on this.

1564
01:23:52,523 --> 01:23:54,958
But I don't want to
take all the credit...

1565
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:58,427
so I'll let Robin
present our solutions.

1566
01:23:58,429 --> 01:24:00,297
We're never gonna find
Christopher Robin

1567
01:24:00,299 --> 01:24:02,432
inside this box.

1568
01:24:02,434 --> 01:24:05,468
Can you see any of the others?

1569
01:24:05,470 --> 01:24:08,304
Hello? How are you
getting on in there?

1570
01:24:08,306 --> 01:24:10,472
Dark. Gloomy.

1571
01:24:10,474 --> 01:24:12,441
You should just leave me here.

1572
01:24:12,443 --> 01:24:14,843
Don't leave us. Tigger!
Lift it, lift it!

1573
01:24:14,845 --> 01:24:16,646
I got you, Piglet. Don't worry.

1574
01:24:16,648 --> 01:24:18,013
Ain't too heavy for Tigger.

1575
01:24:18,015 --> 01:24:19,783
Thank goodness.
Tiggers are strong!

1576
01:24:19,785 --> 01:24:22,451
Sit tight, and we'll
be there soon.

1577
01:24:22,453 --> 01:24:24,087
Sit tight? What does that mean?

1578
01:24:24,089 --> 01:24:25,688
It means stay right here in
this very, very safe box.

1579
01:24:25,690 --> 01:24:27,457
Tiggers don't sit tight.

1580
01:24:27,459 --> 01:24:29,625
Tiggers barely sit at all.
I gotta tell her.

1581
01:24:29,627 --> 01:24:31,427
Madeline!

1582
01:24:31,429 --> 01:24:33,762
My tail is trapped!

1583
01:24:33,764 --> 01:24:36,432
Pooh? Did you hear that?

1584
01:24:36,434 --> 01:24:39,869
It's hard to hear anything
above my tummy rumbling.

1585
01:24:39,871 --> 01:24:42,771
Okay. Don't worry, I'll
get us outta this mess!

1586
01:24:42,773 --> 01:24:44,106
Madeline said to sit tight

1587
01:24:44,108 --> 01:24:45,775
and she's the
Wimbledon Champion!

1588
01:24:45,777 --> 01:24:48,445
The good news is that
I've found some cuts.

1589
01:24:48,447 --> 01:24:50,646
But it's not going to be easy.

1590
01:24:50,648 --> 01:24:52,615
We'll have to
reduce overheads...

1591
01:24:52,617 --> 01:24:55,118
and find cheaper suppliers.

1592
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:56,686
Well, there'll be
sacrifices to be made

1593
01:24:56,688 --> 01:24:57,954
in terms of our workforce.

1594
01:24:57,956 --> 01:24:59,688
He's talking about me.

1595
01:24:59,690 --> 01:25:00,957
Yes, I think he probably is.
Oh, dear.

1596
01:25:00,959 --> 01:25:03,459
Sacrifices are fine, Robin.

1597
01:25:03,461 --> 01:25:06,299
Just show us the proposals.

1598
01:25:07,866 --> 01:25:10,133
Right, um...

1599
01:25:10,135 --> 01:25:12,738
It's all here. In my papers.

1600
01:25:14,038 --> 01:25:15,504
Um...

1601
01:25:15,506 --> 01:25:17,941
They are a tad rushed...

1602
01:25:17,943 --> 01:25:20,110
so, um, I'd bear with me.

1603
01:25:20,112 --> 01:25:21,781
Um, hold on.

1604
01:25:26,818 --> 01:25:28,084
Robin.

1605
01:25:28,086 --> 01:25:29,886
Oh, no!

1606
01:25:29,888 --> 01:25:31,154
Robin!

1607
01:25:31,156 --> 01:25:32,821
If we don't solve the issue,

1608
01:25:32,823 --> 01:25:34,490
we'll have no choice
but to shut down!

1609
01:25:34,492 --> 01:25:36,094
What have you got?

1610
01:25:37,996 --> 01:25:39,896
Uh... Well, sir...

1611
01:25:39,898 --> 01:25:42,768
I think what's happened is...

1612
01:25:44,435 --> 01:25:46,002
I'm so sorry, Mr. Robin.

1613
01:25:46,004 --> 01:25:47,704
There's an emergency.
Your wife is outside.

1614
01:25:47,706 --> 01:25:50,039
She can't find Madeline.

1615
01:25:50,041 --> 01:25:51,473
Oh, ladies and gentlemen,
I have to step outside.

1616
01:25:51,475 --> 01:25:52,842
Please excuse me.

1617
01:25:52,844 --> 01:25:54,714
What the devil are you doing?

1618
01:26:04,422 --> 01:26:06,423
My tail! You're
gonna pull it off!

1619
01:26:06,425 --> 01:26:09,726
No tail lasts forever.

1620
01:26:09,728 --> 01:26:12,027
Bounce with me! Bounce,
bounce, bounce!

1621
01:26:12,029 --> 01:26:14,196
Everybody bounce!

1622
01:26:14,198 --> 01:26:16,098
Careful, Tigger. Things
might get worse!

1623
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:19,835
Nonsense! Nothing ever
bad came from bouncing.

1624
01:26:21,005 --> 01:26:22,771
It's getting worse.

1625
01:26:24,509 --> 01:26:26,045
This way. Up here.

1626
01:26:31,450 --> 01:26:33,115
Where is she?

1627
01:26:33,117 --> 01:26:35,517
I don't know. Somewhere
between here and the station.

1628
01:26:35,519 --> 01:26:37,455
She's all alone.

1629
01:26:38,956 --> 01:26:40,522
"Expotition?"

1630
01:26:40,524 --> 01:26:42,460
No, she's not alone.
Who's she with?

1631
01:26:43,894 --> 01:26:45,695
I wanna go home.

1632
01:26:45,697 --> 01:26:47,996
We'll be fine. We won't
hit anything else.

1633
01:26:53,604 --> 01:26:55,840
Robin was a reasonably good man.

1634
01:26:58,076 --> 01:27:00,043
Shame he went mad.

1635
01:27:00,045 --> 01:27:01,945
Oh, dear.

1636
01:27:01,947 --> 01:27:03,646
The wonderful thing
about Tiggers is...

1637
01:27:03,648 --> 01:27:05,048
their tops are made
out of rubber,

1638
01:27:05,050 --> 01:27:06,530
their bottoms are
made out of springs.

1639
01:27:08,787 --> 01:27:10,820
Tail, you're back!

1640
01:27:10,822 --> 01:27:12,588
Tastes like milk.

1641
01:27:12,590 --> 01:27:14,223
I was pretending that
there was a Heffalump.

1642
01:27:14,225 --> 01:27:15,991
But of course, there
wasn't really a Heffalump.

1643
01:27:15,993 --> 01:27:17,694
Are you hearing yourself?
You need to quit.

1644
01:27:17,696 --> 01:27:19,529
I think that decision's
about to be made for me.

1645
01:27:19,531 --> 01:27:21,164
Stick with me, Piglet.
I'll fix this!

1646
01:27:21,166 --> 01:27:22,865
You worry too much.

1647
01:27:22,867 --> 01:27:24,834
Oh, we'll never get
to Christopher now!

1648
01:27:24,836 --> 01:27:26,201
Maybe we should ask if
anyone's seen a bear

1649
01:27:26,203 --> 01:27:27,770
or a Tigger or a
very small donkey.

1650
01:27:27,772 --> 01:27:29,571
Darling, these
creatures aren't real.

1651
01:27:29,573 --> 01:27:31,106
Don't worry. This is
part of the plan.

1652
01:27:31,108 --> 01:27:32,674
Careful! We don't
want to fly out!

1653
01:27:32,676 --> 01:27:34,744
We just need a leap of faith!

1654
01:27:34,746 --> 01:27:36,713
Listen, I will call
Dr. Cunningham on Monday.

1655
01:27:36,715 --> 01:27:38,275
I think with the right
amount of rest...

1656
01:27:39,885 --> 01:27:41,551
Christopher! Tigger! Eeyore!

1657
01:27:44,989 --> 01:27:46,890
Piglet! Ah.

1658
01:27:46,892 --> 01:27:49,558
My plan worked. I don't
know how I do it.

1659
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:51,660
You must be Christopher
Robin's wife.

1660
01:27:51,662 --> 01:27:53,629
Ha. How do you do?

1661
01:27:53,631 --> 01:27:56,098
My bum hurts.

1662
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:58,767
And now this. Oh.

1663
01:27:58,769 --> 01:28:00,904
What have we here?
Some sort of medal?

1664
01:28:00,906 --> 01:28:03,539
Voodoo emblem, do you think?

1665
01:28:03,541 --> 01:28:05,074
Madness takes many
forms, Father.

1666
01:28:05,076 --> 01:28:06,776
It does.

1667
01:28:06,778 --> 01:28:09,212
I thought you were
working on this, too.

1668
01:28:09,214 --> 01:28:11,246
Don't you have a copy?

1669
01:28:11,248 --> 01:28:12,518
Um...

1670
01:28:13,919 --> 01:28:16,252
I have an alternative solution.

1671
01:28:16,254 --> 01:28:18,120
Ah. I'm listening.

1672
01:28:18,122 --> 01:28:22,792
We fire the entire efficiency
department for a start.

1673
01:28:22,794 --> 01:28:24,227
Let's get going.

1674
01:28:24,229 --> 01:28:25,895
Where's Madeline?

1675
01:28:25,897 --> 01:28:28,798
She's in a truck.
Headed Woozlewards!

1676
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:30,799
Woozlewards?

1677
01:28:30,801 --> 01:28:32,735
Winslow's! Winslow's!

1678
01:28:32,737 --> 01:28:34,102
Drive to Winslow's. That's
where Madeline will be.

1679
01:28:34,104 --> 01:28:35,304
We're going to Winslow's, yes.

1680
01:28:42,980 --> 01:28:45,048
Where are the others?

1681
01:28:45,050 --> 01:28:48,651
They must've gone off on
their own expotition.

1682
01:28:48,653 --> 01:28:51,788
At least they left us
the important papers.

1683
01:28:51,790 --> 01:28:53,690
We need to get these
to Father right away.

1684
01:28:53,692 --> 01:28:54,923
Come on, Pooh!

1685
01:28:54,925 --> 01:28:56,692
Christopher? Yes, hon?

1686
01:28:56,694 --> 01:28:58,761
Is that a talking donkey?
It's Eeyore.

1687
01:28:58,763 --> 01:29:00,797
Eeyore, this is Evelyn, my wife.

1688
01:29:00,799 --> 01:29:02,899
Hello, Evelyn my wife.

1689
01:29:02,901 --> 01:29:06,102
Hello, talking donkey,
how are you doing today?

1690
01:29:06,104 --> 01:29:08,007
Don't get me started.

1691
01:29:24,221 --> 01:29:25,621
We did it, Pooh!

1692
01:29:25,623 --> 01:29:26,688
Oh, yes!

1693
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:30,795
Oh, no!

1694
01:29:44,876 --> 01:29:46,278
Oh, no!

1695
01:29:47,946 --> 01:29:50,746
Oh. Oh, Pooh.

1696
01:29:50,748 --> 01:29:52,617
Poor Christopher.

1697
01:29:57,721 --> 01:30:00,757
I'm so sorry, Madeline.

1698
01:30:00,759 --> 01:30:02,392
- Madeline!
- Christopher Robin!

1699
01:30:02,394 --> 01:30:03,660
Daddy!

1700
01:30:03,662 --> 01:30:05,230
Thank God we found you.

1701
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,732
Are you all right?

1702
01:30:11,836 --> 01:30:14,771
I lost your papers.

1703
01:30:14,773 --> 01:30:16,204
I'm so sorry.

1704
01:30:16,206 --> 01:30:17,406
Madeline!

1705
01:30:17,408 --> 01:30:20,142
Darling, that doesn't matter.

1706
01:30:20,144 --> 01:30:22,145
You're safe. That's
all that's important.

1707
01:30:22,147 --> 01:30:24,015
Not my papers.

1708
01:30:26,084 --> 01:30:28,750
But your work is so important.

1709
01:30:28,752 --> 01:30:33,088
I thought that maybe if I
brought you your papers...

1710
01:30:33,090 --> 01:30:34,691
that you wouldn't send me away,

1711
01:30:34,693 --> 01:30:36,061
and then we could
all be together.

1712
01:30:39,163 --> 01:30:41,032
I saved a little bit.

1713
01:30:45,135 --> 01:30:47,203
Sweetheart.

1714
01:30:47,205 --> 01:30:49,972
I was wrong about work.

1715
01:30:49,974 --> 01:30:51,406
I was wrong about everything...

1716
01:30:51,408 --> 01:30:53,812
and I'm so sorry.

1717
01:30:55,212 --> 01:30:57,849
I've been a father of
very little brain.

1718
01:30:59,416 --> 01:31:01,219
I lost myself, Maddy.

1719
01:31:02,353 --> 01:31:04,454
And I almost lost you.

1720
01:31:04,456 --> 01:31:07,289
My most precious love.

1721
01:31:07,291 --> 01:31:09,225
And I don't want you to go away.

1722
01:31:09,227 --> 01:31:11,127
You don't have to go
to boarding school.

1723
01:31:11,129 --> 01:31:14,033
You can stay here with us,
and I'll never let you go.

1724
01:31:26,745 --> 01:31:29,078
And I'll read you a bedtime
story every night.

1725
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:30,445
I'd like that.

1726
01:31:30,447 --> 01:31:33,048
Though maybe I'll
choose from now on.

1727
01:31:33,050 --> 01:31:35,084
All right.

1728
01:31:35,086 --> 01:31:37,122
Oh, you gave us a real fright.

1729
01:31:44,261 --> 01:31:48,330
Well, another
disastrous expotition.

1730
01:31:48,332 --> 01:31:50,133
I don't know about that, Eeyore.

1731
01:31:50,135 --> 01:31:52,200
It all depends on how
you look at things.

1732
01:31:54,371 --> 01:31:56,038
Mom, did you know that
we went to the train

1733
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:57,076
and had a tea party?

1734
01:32:03,413 --> 01:32:04,946
Darling, you're a genius!

1735
01:32:04,948 --> 01:32:06,018
Oh.

1736
01:32:06,951 --> 01:32:08,183
Come on!

1737
01:32:08,185 --> 01:32:09,886
Oh. Off we go again. Righto.

1738
01:32:09,888 --> 01:32:10,968
Come on, it's not too late.

1739
01:32:11,889 --> 01:32:13,088
Oh. Wait for me!

1740
01:32:17,528 --> 01:32:19,962
Mr. Robin?

1741
01:32:19,964 --> 01:32:21,798
Come on!

1742
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:24,737
Ooh, that floor would be
good for bouncing! Whoo-hoo!

1743
01:32:28,038 --> 01:32:30,375
Oh, you're back! Thank goodness.

1744
01:32:37,114 --> 01:32:38,548
Stop!

1745
01:32:38,550 --> 01:32:39,949
I have the answer.

1746
01:32:39,951 --> 01:32:41,083
This better be worth the wait.

1747
01:32:41,085 --> 01:32:42,552
Oh, it is, sir.

1748
01:32:42,554 --> 01:32:44,194
Because the answer to
all your problems...

1749
01:32:44,421 --> 01:32:45,821
is nothing.

1750
01:32:45,823 --> 01:32:47,222
Nothing?

1751
01:32:47,224 --> 01:32:48,891
Nothing comes from
nothing, Robin.

1752
01:32:48,893 --> 01:32:50,426
Oh, that's where you're wrong.

1753
01:32:50,428 --> 01:32:53,094
Doing nothing leads to
the very best something.

1754
01:32:53,096 --> 01:32:54,963
I told you, he's gone crackers.

1755
01:32:54,965 --> 01:32:57,299
What happens when people
have time off work?

1756
01:32:57,301 --> 01:32:59,302
Nothing to do.

1757
01:32:59,304 --> 01:33:00,969
They go on holiday.

1758
01:33:00,971 --> 01:33:03,041
And what do people
need to go on holiday?

1759
01:33:04,041 --> 01:33:06,042
Luggage, Mr. Winslow!

1760
01:33:06,044 --> 01:33:09,512
You employ thousands of people
all across your companies...

1761
01:33:09,514 --> 01:33:11,513
and if you were to give
them all paid holidays...

1762
01:33:11,515 --> 01:33:13,481
Paid holidays?

1763
01:33:13,483 --> 01:33:14,786
At the moment...

1764
01:33:16,086 --> 01:33:18,454
you supply the wealthy.

1765
01:33:18,456 --> 01:33:20,990
And no one else.

1766
01:33:20,992 --> 01:33:22,227
Do you see?

1767
01:33:23,193 --> 01:33:24,962
But now look.

1768
01:33:27,532 --> 01:33:30,199
If we all could afford
to go on holiday...

1769
01:33:30,201 --> 01:33:31,868
up here...

1770
01:33:31,870 --> 01:33:33,302
there would be hundreds

1771
01:33:33,304 --> 01:33:35,237
and thousands of
ordinary people...

1772
01:33:35,239 --> 01:33:38,207
going to the countryside, to
the lakes, and beaches...

1773
01:33:38,209 --> 01:33:40,610
all with their Winslow Luggage.

1774
01:33:40,612 --> 01:33:42,611
And if we made the
prices cheaper...

1775
01:33:42,613 --> 01:33:45,213
then everybody could
afford to buy them.

1776
01:33:45,215 --> 01:33:46,982
Oh, great.

1777
01:33:46,984 --> 01:33:49,886
Our lovely beaches rammed
with hoi polloi...

1778
01:33:49,888 --> 01:33:52,621
with their gramophones
and bottles of cider.

1779
01:33:52,623 --> 01:33:54,589
Now, now, hold on, Giles.

1780
01:33:54,591 --> 01:33:57,058
Father, please. This
is clearly codswallop!

1781
01:33:57,060 --> 01:33:59,464
Well, you would say that,
wouldn't you, Giles?

1782
01:34:00,497 --> 01:34:01,966
And why is that?

1783
01:34:04,301 --> 01:34:05,567
Because you're a Woozle.

1784
01:34:05,569 --> 01:34:07,003
So that's what

1785
01:34:07,005 --> 01:34:08,303
a Woozle looks like. Shh.

1786
01:34:08,305 --> 01:34:11,406
What the devil is a Woozle?

1787
01:34:11,408 --> 01:34:14,075
A Woozle is a slinking,
little monster...

1788
01:34:14,077 --> 01:34:17,112
who gets everyone else to
do his work for him...

1789
01:34:17,114 --> 01:34:19,318
and hopes that we forget
what's important in our lives.

1790
01:34:20,484 --> 01:34:22,218
Our families.

1791
01:34:22,220 --> 01:34:24,119
Our dear friends.

1792
01:34:24,121 --> 01:34:26,155
The people who love us.

1793
01:34:26,157 --> 01:34:28,691
The people whom we love.

1794
01:34:28,693 --> 01:34:30,092
We're here to tell you...

1795
01:34:30,094 --> 01:34:31,526
I'm here to tell you...

1796
01:34:31,528 --> 01:34:32,695
that we're not
afraid of Heffalumps

1797
01:34:32,697 --> 01:34:34,496
and Woozles anymore. Are we?

1798
01:34:34,498 --> 01:34:37,133
Dear Lord, he has
lost his marbles.

1799
01:34:37,135 --> 01:34:39,235
Has he?

1800
01:34:39,237 --> 01:34:43,638
Let's address the Heffalump
in the room, shall we?

1801
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:46,475
What were you doing
this weekend, Giles?

1802
01:34:46,477 --> 01:34:47,977
What?

1803
01:34:47,979 --> 01:34:49,544
Me?

1804
01:34:50,982 --> 01:34:52,451
I told you I was working.

1805
01:34:53,984 --> 01:34:55,484
Oh.

1806
01:34:55,486 --> 01:34:58,154
Now, I've not heard of
a Woozle before, son.

1807
01:34:58,156 --> 01:35:00,690
But by the sound of
it, you are one.

1808
01:35:00,692 --> 01:35:02,391
Me? A Woozle?

1809
01:35:02,393 --> 01:35:04,229
Now sit down, Giles.

1810
01:35:09,733 --> 01:35:12,234
Congratulations, Robin.

1811
01:35:12,236 --> 01:35:15,303
I'd like you to start
on this immediately.

1812
01:35:15,305 --> 01:35:18,074
Thank you very much, sir.
I look forward to it.

1813
01:35:18,076 --> 01:35:20,075
But first...

1814
01:35:20,077 --> 01:35:22,544
I'm going to be doing nothing
for a while with my family.

1815
01:35:22,546 --> 01:35:26,315
Because when you do nothing...

1816
01:35:26,317 --> 01:35:30,719
it leads to the very
best of a something.

1817
01:35:30,721 --> 01:35:32,387
Did I get that right?

1818
01:35:32,389 --> 01:35:34,457
- Close enough, sir.
- Ah.

1819
01:35:34,459 --> 01:35:35,591
Are you ready?

1820
01:35:35,593 --> 01:35:36,961
Oh, Eeyore.

1821
01:35:38,595 --> 01:35:40,098
Here.

1822
01:35:40,732 --> 01:35:41,966
Ah.

1823
01:35:46,336 --> 01:35:48,570
Now we're ready.

1824
01:35:48,572 --> 01:35:50,373
Come on.

1825
01:35:50,375 --> 01:35:53,275
We're going on holiday. Yes.

1826
01:35:53,277 --> 01:35:55,643
That donkey was staring at me.

1827
01:35:55,645 --> 01:35:58,481
A donkey staring at you?

1828
01:35:58,483 --> 01:36:01,283
Clearly, it's you who've
lost your marbles.

1829
01:36:12,330 --> 01:36:16,065
Oh, boy. It is good to be home.

1830
01:36:16,067 --> 01:36:18,100
Oh, I suppose so.

1831
01:36:18,102 --> 01:36:20,503
Weather's too nice.

1832
01:36:20,505 --> 01:36:22,641
Oh! Home sweet home!

1833
01:36:23,573 --> 01:36:25,141
Where have you all been?

1834
01:36:25,143 --> 01:36:27,142
I was about to mount
a search party.

1835
01:36:28,479 --> 01:36:29,611
Hello.

1836
01:36:29,613 --> 01:36:30,780
Who's that, Mum?

1837
01:36:30,782 --> 01:36:31,782
That's a little girl.

1838
01:36:33,251 --> 01:36:35,287
I believe that's a Madeline.

1839
01:36:39,523 --> 01:36:42,758
Ah! Christopher Robin!
You've brought guests.

1840
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:44,392
Welcome to Hundred Acre Wood.

1841
01:36:44,394 --> 01:36:46,061
Right, Rabbit. Fetch tea.

1842
01:36:46,063 --> 01:36:47,262
I beg your pardon?

1843
01:36:47,264 --> 01:36:50,732
You don't get this in Lon Don.

1844
01:36:50,734 --> 01:36:52,567
Go this way, come on.

1845
01:36:55,305 --> 01:36:58,673
Keep north, Christopher.

1846
01:37:02,179 --> 01:37:05,448
Now everyone is happy.

1847
01:37:05,450 --> 01:37:07,450
Owl, would you like some tea?

1848
01:37:07,452 --> 01:37:08,717
- Is it the way I like it?
- Just say yes or no.

1849
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:09,852
I'll take this to Pooh.

1850
01:37:09,854 --> 01:37:11,520
Come on, Madeline!

1851
01:37:11,522 --> 01:37:12,687
I'm gonna show you
how to bounce.

1852
01:37:12,689 --> 01:37:14,656
You're gonna jump real high.

1853
01:37:14,658 --> 01:37:16,191
That's right.

1854
01:37:16,193 --> 01:37:17,692
You're almost as good as I am.

1855
01:37:17,694 --> 01:37:20,596
And Tiggers are the best
springers in the world!

1856
01:37:20,598 --> 01:37:22,397
You're a natural, kid.

1857
01:37:22,399 --> 01:37:23,865
Tigger, just not too high.

1858
01:37:23,867 --> 01:37:25,401
Please, may I have
the last jam tart?

1859
01:37:25,403 --> 01:37:27,436
Thank you, Evelyn my wife.

1860
01:37:27,438 --> 01:37:29,341
Look at that! Amazing!

1861
01:37:38,549 --> 01:37:40,716
Ooh.

1862
01:37:40,718 --> 01:37:42,718
How did you know?

1863
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:44,419
Mmm.

1864
01:37:50,294 --> 01:37:51,860
Christopher Robin.

1865
01:37:51,862 --> 01:37:54,429
What day is it?

1866
01:37:54,431 --> 01:37:56,231
It's today.

1867
01:37:56,233 --> 01:37:57,365
Oh.

1868
01:37:57,367 --> 01:37:59,834
My favorite day.

1869
01:37:59,836 --> 01:38:01,739
Mine too, Pooh.

1870
01:38:03,206 --> 01:38:05,473
Mine, too.

1871
01:38:05,475 --> 01:38:09,311
Yesterday, when it
was tomorrow...

1872
01:38:09,313 --> 01:38:13,551
it was too much day for me.

1873
01:38:15,252 --> 01:38:17,656
Silly old bear.
