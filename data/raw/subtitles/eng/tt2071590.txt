00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:17,545
One, two,
one, two, three, four.

2
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,352
Did you know there's
actually only one groove

3
00:01:24,386 --> 00:01:26,221
on a record?

4
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:27,322
It's true.

5
00:01:27,355 --> 00:01:29,557
Yeah. It looks like all these
individual circles,

6
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:31,559
but no, it's just one.

7
00:01:31,593 --> 00:01:33,495
One single line,

8
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:35,162
1,500 feet of it, to be exact,

9
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:38,165
a third of a mile carving
its way round and round

10
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:39,267
in circles until...

11
00:01:41,236 --> 00:01:43,170
it finally just ends.

12
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:47,107
To make a record it
takes 100 tons of pressure

13
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:49,577
applied under 1,000 degrees
of heat,

14
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:53,047
all to create
this perfect vinyl platter.

15
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:57,319
Now, what music
goes on the record,

16
00:01:57,352 --> 00:01:59,387
well, that's where I come in.

17
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,291

as did six other labels,

33
00:02:49,304 --> 00:02:52,273

-Five other labels, Mr. Hawkins,

34
00:02:52,307 --> 00:02:54,642
and you've only spoken
to the head of one of them.

35
00:02:54,676 --> 00:02:58,279
Now, give me this song
and I promise you,

36
00:02:58,313 --> 00:03:00,415
we will own radio.

there is just no one better.

43
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:14,128
No, no. You called me
Mr. Hawkins, not Reverend.

44
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:16,264
I'm not pretending there's not
a line.

74

"Oh, Happy Day" sold
over seven million records.

75
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:24,466
It even won us a Grammy.
Hmm.

76
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:28,303
Alright. The choir
wasn't actually there

77
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:30,605
when I got arrived.
I didn't get up the stage

78
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:32,640
and perform the song,
but you know what?

79
00:04:32,674 --> 00:04:34,174
I could have.

80
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:37,378
Hell of a lot more fun
to tell it that way, though.

81
00:04:37,412 --> 00:04:39,781
You realize that that's
gonna be the problem

82
00:04:39,814 --> 00:04:41,549
with all these stories, right?

83
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,486
Listen. I'm not... I'm not sayig
that people are gonna be lying.

84
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,053
It's just... Okay.

85
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,356
Well, some of them might be.

86
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:49,757
It's just that memories,

87
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,726
memories are complicated,
you know.

88
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,528
We remember
what we wanna remember.

89
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:56,664
And we forget
what we need to forget.

90
00:05:02,237 --> 00:05:04,572
To be at the heart of something
as impossibly successful

91
00:05:04,606 --> 00:05:05,673
as what we had...

92
00:05:05,707 --> 00:05:07,775
Gladys Knight,
the Isley Brothers,

93
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:11,379
Bill Withers, Parliament,
the Village People, Kiss,

94
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:12,280
and Donna...

95
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,516
it's... How do you expect me to
tell you

96
00:05:14,549 --> 00:05:16,417
how all that really happened?

97
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:20,087
Couple guys broke as we were

98
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,590
to making
over $100 million a year.

99
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:25,793
I mean, first, you'd have
to understand our crew,

100
00:05:25,827 --> 00:05:28,429
because there was just no one
else ever like them.

101
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,832
Cecil was my best friend.

102
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:33,133
He was also a record executive
who loved the artists

103
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,802
and the music
even more than the business,

104
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:36,471
and the artists themselves...
Oh, my God.

105
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:38,740
They sure loved him...
and trusted him,

106
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:40,708
more than they ever trusted me.

107
00:05:40,742 --> 00:05:41,643
Larry was a music fan

108
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:43,678
long before he ever became
an executive.

109
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:45,112
It was why he was so effective

110
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:46,714
staying out on the road
with the bands.

111
00:05:46,748 --> 00:05:48,216
He was also my cousin,

112
00:05:48,249 --> 00:05:52,152
and all great business
is family.

113
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,690
Buck had been a short-order
cook before he married Nancy.

114
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:57,425
Our PR man,
he was the connection guy

115
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,327
who could convince
just about anyone

116
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,429
to do just about anything.

117
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,331
And Nancy.

118
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:06,434
God. Every DJ
and radio program director

119
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:08,469
just loved Nance.

120
00:06:08,503 --> 00:06:09,537
She was our secret weapon,

121
00:06:09,571 --> 00:06:12,340
getting our music on the air
and into your lives.

122
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:15,209
She was also my wife's sister.

123
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:18,880
Beth was, um...

124
00:06:18,913 --> 00:06:21,148
Well, she was the first person
who ever believed

125
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:23,384
my dreams could be
more than just dreams.

126
00:06:23,418 --> 00:06:26,153
She was the first one
to ever truly believe in me.

127
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:29,324
And Joyce...

128
00:06:29,357 --> 00:06:32,460
You know, I may have met her
as Kiss's manager, but...

129
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:34,729
well, we'll get to Joyce.

130
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:37,632
Just... give me a little time.

131
00:06:39,367 --> 00:06:42,169
Look. I know that we've been
blamed for a lot of bad things

132
00:06:42,203 --> 00:06:43,338
that happened,
and I'm not saying

133
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:46,207
it's not sex, drugs, and rock
and roll, because it was.

134
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,376
It's just, it was sex before
it was deadly, you know?

135
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,411
And finding out who wasn't
doing drugs would be

136
00:06:50,445 --> 00:06:53,681
a hell of a lot harder story
for you to tell.

137
00:06:53,715 --> 00:06:56,384
But if what you're after
is the truth

138
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,653
of not just what happened
but how it happened,

139
00:06:58,686 --> 00:07:00,888
then, you know, you're
just gonna have to believe

140
00:07:00,922 --> 00:07:04,726
all of it, because every
single bit of it

141
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,294

00:08:26,474 --> 00:08:28,710
Yeah, well, just remember,
the house always wins,

179
00:08:28,743 --> 00:08:30,378
even against you.

180
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:32,513
-You wanna bet?
-I bet they suck.

181
00:08:32,547 --> 00:08:33,514
Uh-huh.

182
00:08:38,486 --> 00:08:39,454
Mwah.

183
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:48,329
Hello. So, I had a thought...

184
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,531
on my way
over here tonight.

185
00:08:50,565 --> 00:08:53,468
I thought to myself,
"What the hell am I doing

186
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:55,603
in Humphrey Bogart's
actual suit?"

187
00:08:57,505 --> 00:08:59,941
Poor kid
from the Brooklyn projects,

188
00:08:59,974 --> 00:09:01,342
son of a postman.

189
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,277
Oh, stand up, Pops. Pops.

190
00:09:03,311 --> 00:09:04,545
-There he is.
-Thank you. Thank you.

191
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:07,749
-Oh, sure. Take a bow. Why not?
-Learned everything from me.

192
00:09:07,782 --> 00:09:08,816
Bad stuff from his mother.

193
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:11,853
Hell of a long trip
from Brooklyn, huh?

194
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:13,354
Not so far, kid.

195
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:15,923
Dreams...

196
00:09:15,957 --> 00:09:18,893
only come true for those who
believe in them.

197
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:21,329
So, tonight,
to celebrate the launch

198
00:09:21,362 --> 00:09:24,665
of the biggest independent
record label in history,

199
00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:28,569
we thought we'd share
some of our dreams with you.

200
00:09:28,603 --> 00:09:31,038
So, you may have heard them
on the radio,

201
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:33,508
but after what you're
about to experience tonight,

202
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,543
you're never gonna forget
these guys.

203
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,044
So, put your two lips together

204
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:40,581
for the hottest band
in the world, KISS!

205
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,054
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that way.

206
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:49,690
- Hello, Los Angeles!
- Ah!

207
00:09:49,724 --> 00:09:52,527
- How we feeling tonight?
- Yeah, good. More.

we were finished.

00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:56,110
You made it rain

256
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:58,079
Do another trick.

257
00:12:58,112 --> 00:12:59,747
I'm working on it, honey.

258
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,116
I'll get Jill home
to Beth and the boys.

259
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:04,118
Just tell her
I'll be home soon.

260
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:06,554
But you promised
we'd dance, Daddy!

261
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,624
You bet I did.

00:14:24,732 --> 00:14:28,035

271
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:29,337
Hey, you okay?

272
00:14:29,371 --> 00:14:31,705
Your sister tell you
what happened tonight?

273
00:14:32,307 --> 00:14:34,342
Yeah.

<i>we'd still always been</i>

277
00:15:06,874 --> 00:15:08,943
They, uh, say the biggest sin
of a record man

278
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:11,112
is believing in something
because you have to,

279
00:15:11,145 --> 00:15:13,315
not because you do.

280
00:15:13,348 --> 00:15:15,283
But I <i>had</i> believed in Kiss,

281
00:15:15,317 --> 00:15:17,751

what Casablanca could be.

283
00:15:19,287 --> 00:15:21,755

the death of Casablanca.

285
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,760
Hello, Casablanca.

286
00:15:26,794 --> 00:15:27,862
Not that that was gonna
stop us.

287

Mark Parenteau, WABX!
Kiss just got added

288
00:15:30,298 --> 00:15:31,732
to regular rotation
in Detroit.

289
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,868
Nance, you paid off Mark
to do that, didn't you?

290
00:15:33,901 --> 00:15:35,203
Of course I did.

Mo Ostin at Warners
needs you to call him back.

00:15:38,873 --> 00:15:40,674
-Of course he does.
-He called six times.

294
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,144
Of course he did.

295
00:15:43,177 --> 00:15:44,246
Hey, Cec!

Oh. Just tell them
to get ready for the tour.

299
00:15:50,184 --> 00:15:52,354
-You got KISS a tour?
-No, but you're gonna do it.

300
00:15:52,387 --> 00:15:53,588
Just find 'em a headliner

301
00:15:53,622 --> 00:15:55,823

- Scotty! You listen to this yet?
- Ah, yeah,

304

They're different.

-After last night,

306
00:16:04,932 --> 00:16:05,933
too different.

were different.

and the sixteenth notes,

330

334
00:17:28,182 --> 00:17:29,984
An American girl.

335
00:17:30,017 --> 00:17:32,554
She does the musicals in Munich.

336
00:17:32,587 --> 00:17:34,456
LaDonna Gaines.

337
00:17:34,489 --> 00:17:36,424
Gaines. Gaines.

338
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,892
Her first husband's name was
Sommer.

339
00:17:38,926 --> 00:17:40,562
Everything is hotter
in summer.

340
00:17:40,595 --> 00:17:43,097
An Italian from Germany
writing in English.

341
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,065
You know what?
Maybe we pretend she's German.

342
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:46,534
I never could figure out
his accent.

343
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:49,069
What? Neil, you can't afford
to buy my music.

344
00:17:49,103 --> 00:17:50,505
I may not have been
at your party,

345
00:17:50,538 --> 00:17:52,207
but I could read. Even English.

346
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,542
The party was to announce
that we're open for business,

347
00:17:54,576 --> 00:17:56,478
and now, we're on the cover
of everything.

348
00:17:56,511 --> 00:17:57,646
Because they say
you're finished.

349
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,282
That's 'cause they don't know
what starting looks like,

350
00:18:00,315 --> 00:18:05,052
Giorgio. Now, I don't want
your music for our label, okay?

351
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:10,258
I want it for yours.
Oasis <i>through</i> Casablanca.

352
00:18:11,593 --> 00:18:14,194
You let them write about that.

353
00:18:14,229 --> 00:18:17,031
Giorgio, why don't we take
a look at some artwork?

354
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,835
Good old flash paper
trick, huh?

355
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:25,172
Oh! Nelly, Warners wants
to bleed us to death.

356
00:18:25,206 --> 00:18:27,975
I snuck a tape recorder into
their little sales meeting.

357
00:18:28,008 --> 00:18:30,044
They wanna kill KISS
to kill us.

358
00:18:31,011 --> 00:18:32,580
Hello, Casablanca.

359
00:18:32,614 --> 00:18:34,249
Neil, I think
you're overreacting.

360
00:18:34,282 --> 00:18:36,251
Oh, really? So you're telling me
that Bruce here

361
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:38,420
did not tell your teams
not to push our records?

362
00:18:38,453 --> 00:18:40,221
Bruce, the boys have concerns

363
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,324
about how we're
handling Casablanca.

364
00:18:42,357 --> 00:18:44,992
Actually, Brucie,
the boys here are concerned

365
00:18:45,025 --> 00:18:46,994
that you might be a spineless
little cocksucker.

366
00:18:47,027 --> 00:18:49,063
-Oh, yeah. That's also true.
-Well, we don't have

367
00:18:49,096 --> 00:18:50,931
any actual proof
about the cock-sucking.

368
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,200
But we all know, and no one
here's gonna judge you, Bruce.

369
00:18:53,234 --> 00:18:55,503
-Fuck you, and fuck you!
-You see that, Mo?

370
00:18:55,537 --> 00:18:57,605
He's trying to fuck me.
I don't blame him.

371
00:18:57,639 --> 00:18:59,307
Nobody gives a shit
about KISS.

372
00:18:59,341 --> 00:19:01,509
-Were you not at the party?
-This ain't got a damn thing

373
00:19:01,543 --> 00:19:03,043
to do about the party, and you
know it.

374
00:19:03,077 --> 00:19:04,178
Oh, you're right about that.

375
00:19:04,212 --> 00:19:06,247
It's about the fact that they
can't cut a radio hit.

376
00:19:06,281 --> 00:19:08,616
Their bullshit stage tricks
make them a fucking joke,

377
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,951
not an act. That's why
their record's not selling.

378
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,654
I wanna play you
a little something

379
00:19:12,687 --> 00:19:14,222
from our newest record.

380
00:19:14,255 --> 00:19:15,956
You're an asshole, Bruce.

381
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,393
Mo, just take a listen.
It's got a hell of a hook.

382
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,962
We don't promote KISS

383
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:23,163
or any Casablanca records.

384
00:19:23,197 --> 00:19:25,367
We don't push 'em,
they can't sell 'em,

385
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,468
and that's how we end 'em.

386
00:19:26,501 --> 00:19:29,036
Fuckin' bleed 'em to death.

387
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:32,973
- You fucking recorded me?
- Don't touch me.

388
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:35,310
-My wife got me that table.
-He fucking touched me, man.

389
00:19:35,343 --> 00:19:37,978
What the fuck?
This is fucking Warner Brothers,

390
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,913
not some fucking
New York back alley

391
00:19:39,947 --> 00:19:40,981
you just crawled out of,
assholes!

392
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:43,150
You messed with our business,
Bruce, and nobody,

393
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:45,953
fucking nobody,
messes with our business,

394
00:19:45,986 --> 00:19:47,522
-not even you, Mo.
-What the hell

395
00:19:47,555 --> 00:19:49,189
do you really want?

396
00:19:49,224 --> 00:19:51,693
Huh? You didn't come
all the way over here

397
00:19:51,726 --> 00:19:53,561
just to beat up Bruce.

398
00:19:53,595 --> 00:19:54,928
-I did.
-No.

399
00:19:57,365 --> 00:19:59,300
We want out.

400
00:19:59,334 --> 00:20:02,504
-From our distribution?
-Fucking everything, all of it.

401
00:20:02,537 --> 00:20:07,141
You're broke.

402
00:20:07,174 --> 00:20:09,943
The whole town knows it.
What are you gonna do?

403
00:20:09,977 --> 00:20:11,413
Go door to door
across the country,

404
00:20:11,446 --> 00:20:13,681
selling your records yourselves?

405
00:20:13,715 --> 00:20:15,149
You'll never survive without us.

406
00:20:15,182 --> 00:20:18,152
No. We'll never survive
<i>with</i> you.

407
00:20:18,185 --> 00:20:20,087
You're gonna remember
this fucking meeting.

408
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,157
No, and... and not
with a fucking smile.

409
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,059
So, bill me for your table
and have a nice fucking day.

410
00:20:27,328 --> 00:20:30,698
Hey. You do know
no one's ever done this before?

411
00:20:30,732 --> 00:20:32,434
Because no one's
ever tried before.

412
00:20:35,403 --> 00:20:37,472
Launching
our own distribution, we weren't

413
00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:40,174
just going up against Warners.
We were waging an all-out war

414
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,343
against all the majors at once.

415
00:20:43,478 --> 00:20:45,112
But if we were gonna survive,

416
00:20:45,145 --> 00:20:46,714
we absolutely needed a hit,

417
00:20:46,748 --> 00:20:51,219
which meant we absolutely
needed something new.

418
00:20:53,221 --> 00:20:56,156
LaDonna Adrian Gaines
may have been born in Boston,

419
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,058
but her dreams had landed her
in Germany,

420
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:00,060
which is where her story with us
really begins.

421
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,162
-You're late.
-I'm as early as I could be.

422
00:21:02,196 --> 00:21:03,665
He's releasing the song
in America,

423
00:21:03,698 --> 00:21:05,333
and I mean right away.

424
00:21:05,366 --> 00:21:07,402
What? We haven't even recorded
the real song yet.

425
00:21:07,435 --> 00:21:09,537
-It's just a demo.
-When I'm done with the mix,

426
00:21:09,571 --> 00:21:11,539
no one will care.

427
00:21:11,573 --> 00:21:13,541
I'll care.

428
00:21:16,377 --> 00:21:19,046
Uh, you gave him control
over how I look?

429
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:21,382
He creates an image, a story.
It's what he does.

430
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,618
Well, don't you think he should
at least meet the real me

431
00:21:23,651 --> 00:21:27,087
before he decides there needs
to be a fake one created?

432
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,758
LaDonna, your daughter
is asleep in the hallway

433
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:33,228
instead of a bedroom
all her own, dreaming

434
00:21:33,261 --> 00:21:36,397
a sweeter dream than you
could ever provide her alone.

435
00:21:36,431 --> 00:21:39,367
You will never get
another chance like this.

436
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,368
Sign it.

437
00:21:44,806 --> 00:21:48,409
They... they legally changed
my name?

438
00:21:48,443 --> 00:21:50,245
He changed his, too.

439
00:21:50,278 --> 00:21:51,513
He was right. I had.

440
00:21:51,546 --> 00:21:54,415
And not just once.

441
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,185
I was actually
born Neil Bogatz,

442
00:21:58,219 --> 00:22:00,120
growing up
in the Glenwood projects

443
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:01,789
of Brooklyn, New York.

444
00:22:01,823 --> 00:22:04,692
Alright, Neil.
What else do you want?

445
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:09,162
All of it.

446
00:22:10,365 --> 00:22:12,132
By the time
I was eight years old,

447
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:13,801
I already knew
that the life that I wanted

448
00:22:13,835 --> 00:22:16,237
was far, far away from here.

449
00:22:30,752 --> 00:22:33,221
Please. I swear!

450
00:22:33,254 --> 00:22:34,355
You hear that, kid?

451
00:22:34,389 --> 00:22:37,190
Your pops says
he swears this time!

452
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,572
You dropped your egg cream.

453
00:22:51,906 --> 00:22:53,641
We'll get you a refill.

454
00:23:03,384 --> 00:23:04,519
Are we poor, Pop?

455
00:23:04,552 --> 00:23:05,520
What?

456
00:23:07,822 --> 00:23:10,123
What you worried about? Huh?

457
00:23:10,858 --> 00:23:13,494
Hey, money's easy.

458
00:23:13,528 --> 00:23:14,862
You can always find money.

459
00:23:14,896 --> 00:23:16,664
A person's got to know
what to do with it.

460
00:23:16,698 --> 00:23:18,198
That's what counts.

461
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:21,202
Do you know what to do with it?

462
00:23:21,235 --> 00:23:23,805
Because it's not here.

463
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,809
Do me a favor, boychik.

464
00:23:27,842 --> 00:23:31,212
Look at all these people, huh?

465
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:33,615
Now, you got a choice. You can
live in a four-color world

466
00:23:33,648 --> 00:23:35,783
or one in black and white
like all these schmucks

467
00:23:35,817 --> 00:23:37,385
too terrified
to dream of a world

468
00:23:37,418 --> 00:23:40,088
outside
of our four shitty blocks.

469
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:43,123
Eh, not me.

470
00:23:43,891 --> 00:23:45,760
I know what to do with it.

471
00:23:45,793 --> 00:23:47,662
I'm gonna get us
the hell out of here.

472
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,131
Hey. I promise you.

473
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,470
Just... need a little more tim.

474
00:23:55,503 --> 00:23:56,904
That's all.

475
00:24:04,345 --> 00:24:06,247
Neil, you got
all the machines going.

476
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,483
It saves my time,
Mrs. Finkelstein.

477
00:24:08,516 --> 00:24:10,518
If I leave these with you,
you'll put them in

478
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:11,853
when you're done?

479
00:24:11,886 --> 00:24:13,554
I'll give you five cents.

480
00:24:14,555 --> 00:24:16,257
Ten cents.

481
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,458
Saves <i>your</i> time.

482
00:24:19,861 --> 00:24:21,194
You better fold them.

483
00:24:21,229 --> 00:24:22,797
- Let's go!
- Within a month,

484
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,599
I had 40 kids
working the neighborhood.

485
00:24:24,632 --> 00:24:26,701
Here's how it's gonna go.
I'm gonna assign...

486
00:24:26,734 --> 00:24:30,271
Within two, I was
bringing in more than my dad.

487
00:24:30,304 --> 00:24:31,372
You know how it feels

488
00:24:31,406 --> 00:24:32,940
making more money
than your father?

489
00:24:32,974 --> 00:24:35,710
Exactly how you think it does.

490
00:24:38,613 --> 00:24:42,283
By 1961, I had changed
my name again to Neil Scott.

491
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:45,253
I tried acting, playing
the piano, even the sax,

492
00:24:45,286 --> 00:24:47,455
and while I always wanted
to be a singer,

493
00:24:47,488 --> 00:24:50,792
it was as a dancer that
I finally found the beat.

494
00:24:53,861 --> 00:24:56,764
My fiancée,
Erminie McNulty, everybody.

495
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:02,403
I am Neil Scott, your singer,
your dance instructor,

496
00:25:02,437 --> 00:25:04,572
and anything else
you need me to be tonight.

497
00:25:05,707 --> 00:25:08,609
But, uh, that's not
why I'm telling you this part.

498
00:25:16,384 --> 00:25:17,385
Dance.

499
00:25:19,554 --> 00:25:21,889
Is that a statement
or a question

500
00:25:21,923 --> 00:25:24,792
without the inflection
at the end?

501
00:25:24,826 --> 00:25:25,927
Dance with me.

502
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,930
We don't dance with the staff.

503
00:25:28,963 --> 00:25:30,431
Our parents own the hotel.

504
00:25:31,899 --> 00:25:34,469
Well, okay.
Well, then I work for you.

-How many times

652
00:31:29,424 --> 00:31:31,959

656
00:31:37,932 --> 00:31:40,101
-Then we put a new one up.
-What are you gonna do for me?

657
00:31:40,134 --> 00:31:42,670
You're asking him
to advertise your records.

658
00:31:42,703 --> 00:31:44,339
No. I'm asking him to put
a couple posters up

659
00:31:44,372 --> 00:31:46,006
in the window.
It's not the same thing.

660

It's exactly the same thing,
except you're asking him

661

-to do it for free.

Other than what we'd create
later at Casablanca,

no more infamous address

that no one

708
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:52,300
The artists worked with us,
not for us.

709
00:33:52,334 --> 00:33:53,401
They were family,

710
00:33:53,435 --> 00:33:55,102
and that made
all the difference.

711
00:33:55,135 --> 00:33:56,504

716
00:34:10,951 --> 00:34:13,555
Trying to open the...
fucking window.

717
00:34:13,588 --> 00:34:16,156
You're the ones making
a lot of noise downstairs,

718
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,791
that Buddah Records. Yeah.

719
00:34:17,825 --> 00:34:20,027

720
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,431

Neil. Black dollars.

721
00:34:23,465 --> 00:34:24,466
Green dollars, my man.

722
00:34:24,499 --> 00:34:26,133
It's the only color that
matters.

723
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:27,435
Maybe to you.

724
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:30,871
So, Cec tells me
you recorded something new.

725
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:33,140
-I want it.
-You ain't even heard it yet.

726
00:34:33,173 --> 00:34:35,042
Well, you're
the fucking Isley Brothers.

727
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:37,545
So, if Motown is too busy
to make you a priority,

728
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:39,314
then Berry Gordy
can go to the record stores

729
00:34:39,347 --> 00:34:41,583
and buy your fucking music
like everybody else.

730
00:34:41,616 --> 00:34:44,151
Plus, you know that we
move product better than anyone.

731
00:34:44,184 --> 00:34:46,521
We know y'all be paying
motherfuckin' DJs

732
00:34:46,554 --> 00:34:49,023
to play the records
you tell them to.

733
00:34:49,056 --> 00:34:51,925
We don't get pimped out.
You dig?

734
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:54,262
Because we are
the motherfuckin' Isleys.

735
00:34:54,296 --> 00:34:55,263
God damn right.

736
00:34:57,432 --> 00:34:59,301
But you got to be out your mind.

737
00:34:59,334 --> 00:35:03,037
You going head to head
with Berry Gordy himself.

738
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:06,441
Well, it is called
show <i>business.</i>

739
00:35:06,474 --> 00:35:09,843
So, why don't you play me
the song that we're releasing

740
00:35:09,877 --> 00:35:12,846
off of your own new label?

741
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,815
- Our own new label?
- Mm-hmm.

742
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:18,219
That's what you're offering us?

743
00:35:18,253 --> 00:35:20,120
Well, that's your thing, right?

744
00:35:20,154 --> 00:35:22,490
It's a black thing.
A black label.

745
00:35:22,524 --> 00:35:24,492
Careful, motherfucker.

746
00:35:24,526 --> 00:35:26,328
You talk a good talk,
but there's a line.

747
00:35:26,361 --> 00:35:29,997
I'm sorry. I thought
you didn't believe in lines.

748
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,932
You played him
the motherfucking record,

749
00:35:31,965 --> 00:35:34,235
didn't you? Because he wouldn't
even be acting like this

750
00:35:34,269 --> 00:35:36,204
if he ain't heard the shit.

751
00:35:36,237 --> 00:35:38,406
-I sang it for him.
-Don't be lying to me, man.

752
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,142
It's a hot fucking song, Ron.
The man had to hear it.

753
00:35:42,176 --> 00:35:44,245
Do me a favor. Why don't you
scoot on over, Ronnie?

754
00:35:44,279 --> 00:35:46,214
Who the fuck you calling...
This motherfucker

755
00:35:46,247 --> 00:35:48,550
-just called me Ronnie.
-You don't know him like that.

756
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:50,017
Don't be callin' the man Ronnie.

757
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,952
Um, just a term
of endearment, alright?

758
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:54,154
Do I look like
a motherfucking Ronnie to you?

759
00:35:56,257 --> 00:35:58,460
Do I look
like a motherfucking Ronnie

760
00:35:58,493 --> 00:36:00,060

761
00:36:01,195 --> 00:36:02,664
As a matter of fact,
yeah, you look

762
00:36:02,697 --> 00:36:04,865
exactly like a fuckin' Ronnie.

763
00:36:13,675 --> 00:36:16,176
You're a crazy motherfucker.
You got some balls, man.

764
00:36:16,211 --> 00:36:18,680
Let me show you a few ideas
I've been hearing in your music.

765
00:36:18,713 --> 00:36:21,115
Oh, now, you got ideas
to my fucking music.

766
00:36:21,148 --> 00:36:22,283
Yeah.

767
00:36:25,018 --> 00:36:26,488
Show me what you got, Neil.

768
00:36:34,429 --> 00:36:35,896
That dirty guitar?

769
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:38,666
No, no.
You got to turn that shit up.

770
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,302
That nasty brass. Oh.

771
00:36:41,336 --> 00:36:43,705
You tell me that each punch
isn't meant to cut Berry Gordy

772
00:36:43,738 --> 00:36:46,106
right through the fucking gut.

773
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,175
You're a dangerous man,
ain't you?

774
00:36:48,209 --> 00:36:50,177
No, man. I'm just the guy
who knows that you are,

775
00:36:50,211 --> 00:36:52,213
and you fucking should be.
But knockout punches,

776
00:36:52,247 --> 00:36:54,047
they gotta come clean,
be relentless,

777
00:36:54,081 --> 00:36:57,017
and never stop until the body
hits the fucking floor!

778
00:37:08,263 --> 00:37:09,531

in the business,

The thing no one ever really got
about payola

809
00:38:47,495 --> 00:38:48,796
is that we never paid anyone

810
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:51,733

they didn't wanna play.

811
00:38:51,766 --> 00:38:52,767

Yeah, sure.

867
00:41:03,564 --> 00:41:06,334
No. I... I don't know

868
00:41:06,367 --> 00:41:08,201

869

Nah. You go ahead.

870
00:41:09,971 --> 00:41:11,506
I, uh, I got my own things
going on.

871
00:41:11,539 --> 00:41:13,941
-It's going great.
-You sure? 'Cause when you

872
00:41:13,975 --> 00:41:15,877
-called, it was...
-No, I mean, I got...

873
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:17,278
-a cash flow situation.
-Oh.

874
00:41:17,311 --> 00:41:19,380
Temporary. You know,
it's nothing.

875
00:41:19,414 --> 00:41:22,383

It's nothing.

889
00:41:52,313 --> 00:41:54,582
- Yeah. It...
- Don't spend it all.

890

Cookie told me

891
00:42:32,787 --> 00:42:35,623
Must be a hell of a thing,
changing someone's whole life

892
00:42:35,656 --> 00:42:36,457
-like that.
-Mm.

893
00:42:36,491 --> 00:42:38,359
Your mother says
you must have helped

894
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:42,363

He bought all new clothes.

895
00:42:42,396 --> 00:42:43,598
Everybody's counting
on you, Neil,

896
00:42:43,631 --> 00:42:46,367
but you still keep going up
against those guys at Viewlex,

897
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,802

because they can't even dare

905
00:43:05,753 --> 00:43:08,656
-to dream what's beyond them.
-You're quoting your father now.

That's dangerous.

907

No. No. What's dangerous is...

908
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,697

these walls away.

You're gonna shoot your show

943
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:49,590
-That's right.
-Somebody's finally gonna

944
00:44:49,624 --> 00:44:52,660
make a music show that actually
sounds like music.

945

when your friend
from Miami called.

1207
00:57:26,247 --> 00:57:28,349
-Played the odds.
-Yeah, well, Motown was gonna

1208
00:57:28,383 --> 00:57:29,917
sign the Withers kid,
and you knew it.

1209
00:57:29,951 --> 00:57:32,520
-It's just business.
-Not with Berry Gordy.

1210
00:57:32,553 --> 00:57:35,657
-Yeah.
-Look. A gambler's a gambler.

1211
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:37,258
And you're a gambler, kid,

1212
00:57:37,291 --> 00:57:40,261
but you're risking everything
with those fuckin' suits

1213
00:57:40,294 --> 00:57:41,663
who're just waiting
for any excuse

1214
00:57:41,696 --> 00:57:42,930
to bring you down.

1215
00:57:42,964 --> 00:57:46,367
If you're gonna bet this big,
bet on yourself,

1216
00:57:46,401 --> 00:57:48,336
or keep away
from the fucking table

1217
00:57:48,369 --> 00:57:50,438
before too many people get hurt.

1218
00:57:51,572 --> 00:57:52,974
Alright. Alright.

1219
00:57:54,842 --> 00:57:56,344
Big Joey was right.

1220
00:57:56,377 --> 00:57:58,780
We'd taken Buddah Records
as far as we could go.

1221
00:58:02,316 --> 00:58:04,285
If we were ever gonna
really matter, we were gonna

1222
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:05,853
have to raise the stakes,

1223
00:58:05,887 --> 00:58:07,355
higher than ever before.

1224
00:58:40,922 --> 00:58:42,490
Whoo!

1225
00:58:44,692 --> 00:58:46,961
-What have you told her?
-That you've gone insane.

1226
00:58:46,994 --> 00:58:48,629
We're really gonna steal

1227
00:58:48,663 --> 00:58:50,865
-Gladys Knight from Motown, too?
-Hey, you're the one

1228
00:58:50,898 --> 00:58:53,367
that told me she's pissed off
that Berry Gordy is giving

1229
00:58:53,401 --> 00:58:55,870
all their best stuff to Diana
and Marvin and the Temptations.

1230
00:58:55,903 --> 00:58:57,438
-Yeah, she is. She is.
-Alright.

1231
00:58:57,472 --> 00:58:59,974
So let's swing
for the fences, Cec.

1232
00:59:00,007 --> 00:59:01,509
One last big hit.

1233
00:59:01,542 --> 00:59:02,944
What do you mean,
one last big hit?

1234
00:59:02,977 --> 00:59:04,846
Well, you know,
I've always kind of dreamed

1235
00:59:04,879 --> 00:59:06,748
of owning my own record company.

1236
00:59:06,781 --> 00:59:08,850
Didn't you?

1237
00:59:08,883 --> 00:59:10,251
Neil.

1238
00:59:11,385 --> 00:59:15,022
"Midnight Plane to Houston"?
My people from Georgia.

1239
00:59:15,056 --> 00:59:16,891
They would never take
a plane to Houston.

1240
00:59:16,924 --> 00:59:18,559
I'm-a have to change that.

1241
00:59:18,593 --> 00:59:22,029
I'll... I'll let him know.

1242
00:59:22,063 --> 00:59:23,898
Mrs. Gladys Knight,
this is Mr. Neil...

1243
00:59:23,931 --> 00:59:25,767
Neil Bogart.

1244
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,368
I have definitely heard of you.

1245
00:59:27,401 --> 00:59:29,904
Well, only good things, I hope.

1246
00:59:29,937 --> 00:59:31,472
I heard you got
something special.

1247
00:59:31,506 --> 00:59:33,641
Listen, Neil. If Berry finds
out about this, he...

1248
00:59:33,674 --> 00:59:35,943
Hey, if Motown
was treating you properly,

1249
00:59:35,977 --> 00:59:37,812
you wouldn't be here.

1250
00:59:37,845 --> 00:59:40,515
No. <i>Y</i> wouldn't be here.

01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:56,023
but Casablanca, KISS,
and now Donna...

1376
01:05:56,056 --> 01:05:59,160
Mm. So far,
we'd lost every hand.

1377
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,403
No, no, it's dance music, right?

1378
01:06:08,436 --> 01:06:11,439
There is no other voice
like her.

1379
01:06:11,473 --> 01:06:12,907
It's worse than we thought.

1380
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:14,276
What?

1381
01:06:14,309 --> 01:06:15,843
Donna's not selling anywhere?

1382
01:06:15,876 --> 01:06:17,111
No one knows
what to make of her.

1383
01:06:17,144 --> 01:06:19,281
R and B doesn't want her.
Pop doesn't get her.

1384
01:06:19,314 --> 01:06:21,048
-She's just...
-Different.

1385
01:06:21,081 --> 01:06:22,816
The song's dead, man.

1386
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:24,319
You were wrong
about the Gaines girl.

1387
01:06:24,352 --> 01:06:26,321
It's Summer, okay?
It's Donna Summer.

1388
01:06:26,354 --> 01:06:28,189
Well, you were wrong about her,
too, man.

1389
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:29,890
Hello.

1390
01:06:29,924 --> 01:06:32,227
By 1975, we'd done
everything we could think of

1391
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:33,428
to introduce Donna to the world.

1392
01:06:33,461 --> 01:06:34,828
Right in my heart.

1393
01:06:34,862 --> 01:06:38,400
The world just... didn't care.

1394
01:06:38,433 --> 01:06:40,100
You said that he loved the song,

1395
01:06:40,134 --> 01:06:42,970
that he was so sure that it
would change everything.

1396
01:06:44,772 --> 01:06:46,707
The song is over, LaDonna.

1397
01:06:47,375 --> 01:06:48,343
I was wrong.

1398
01:06:58,118 --> 01:07:00,222
Just because the audience
doesn't hear it

1399
01:07:00,255 --> 01:07:02,324
does not mean it isn't there.

1400
01:07:03,458 --> 01:07:06,860
Sometimes, it just takes time.

1401
01:07:08,463 --> 01:07:11,799
But we were out of that, too.

1402
01:07:11,832 --> 01:07:13,834
-Neil, don't do this.
-Hey, you called me, Bill.

1403
01:07:13,867 --> 01:07:15,437
To talk about it, not so that
you could do

1404
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:16,504
whatever you're gonna do.

1405
01:07:16,538 --> 01:07:17,738
This came from Steven Tyler
himself.

1406
01:07:17,771 --> 01:07:20,140
Called and said if we don't cut
the pyro and get a smaller

1407
01:07:20,174 --> 01:07:22,277
sound and lighting rig, we
gotta pack it up and go home.

1408
01:07:22,310 --> 01:07:25,012
-Well, he is the headliner, so.
-Bill, you have to trust us.

1409
01:07:25,045 --> 01:07:26,814
Well, I thought
we were the us.

1410
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:28,250
We're their managers, Joyce,
you and me.

1411
01:07:28,283 --> 01:07:31,319
Neil, I'm begging you,
please don't gamble on this.

1412
01:07:32,387 --> 01:07:34,356
We should have parked closer.

1413
01:07:34,389 --> 01:07:36,857
And sometimes...

1414
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:38,826
they hear it
even when they don't know it.

1415
01:07:49,169 --> 01:07:50,938
Hey, Mr. Aerosmith!

1416
01:07:50,971 --> 01:07:54,209

You lost us an Aerosmith tour.

1454
01:09:54,562 --> 01:09:56,130
The tour was already lost, Gene.

1455
01:09:56,163 --> 01:09:58,566
Aerosmith doesn't want you
anywhere near them, alright?

1456
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,268
No headliner does.
Your...

1457
01:10:00,301 --> 01:10:02,136
Your show
scares the hell out of everyone.

1458
01:10:02,169 --> 01:10:04,138
So you want us
to scale everything down,

1459
01:10:04,171 --> 01:10:07,208
- cut the pyro and the lights?
- No. No. No. No.

1460
01:10:07,242 --> 01:10:09,544
If you're gonna be a headliner,
we're gonna need to make

1461
01:10:09,577 --> 01:10:11,279
everything all that much bigger,
alright?

1462
01:10:11,312 --> 01:10:14,315
That means more explosions
and so much, so much louder.

1463
01:10:14,349 --> 01:10:17,117
I have this guy, alright?
He's got these risers that...

1464
01:10:17,151 --> 01:10:20,622
You really think that more fire
and some forklifts

1465
01:10:20,655 --> 01:10:23,658
are gonna be
what finally breaks us through?

1466
01:10:23,691 --> 01:10:25,025
No.

1467
01:10:25,058 --> 01:10:26,428
No. It is gonna be
the music,

1468
01:10:26,461 --> 01:10:28,696
and it was always gonna be
the music, but we might

1469
01:10:28,730 --> 01:10:31,733
just make enough noise
to... to get enough people

1470
01:10:31,766 --> 01:10:34,034
to actually listen to it,

1471
01:10:34,067 --> 01:10:35,670
to pay attention.

1472
01:10:35,703 --> 01:10:37,971
Why did you sign us?

1473
01:10:38,005 --> 01:10:41,175
Our demo was good, not great.
Even I can admit that.

1474
01:10:41,209 --> 01:10:43,043
You had to know
how hard this was gonna be.

1475
01:10:43,076 --> 01:10:44,245
Why take the risk?

1476
01:10:49,016 --> 01:10:52,487
Because your real name
is Chaim Witz,

1477
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:55,223
and you moved here from Israel
when you were eight years old,

1478
01:10:55,256 --> 01:10:57,592
speaking nothing but Yiddish.

1479
01:10:57,625 --> 01:11:00,462
Because Paul's real name
is Stanley Eisen.

1480
01:11:01,529 --> 01:11:04,198
Because two kids from Queens

1481
01:11:04,232 --> 01:11:06,734
had dreams about being
the next gods of rock.

1482
01:11:09,270 --> 01:11:12,072
And little Neil Bogatz
from the Brooklyn projects

1483
01:11:12,105 --> 01:11:15,108
thinks he can make
everybody's dreams come true...

1484
01:11:17,645 --> 01:11:20,315
if he's just given
a little more time.

1485
01:11:22,217 --> 01:11:24,586
You know, your demo
really was that great, Gene.

1486
01:11:26,254 --> 01:11:30,425
Yeah. Raw and honest
rock and roll,

1487
01:11:30,458 --> 01:11:33,093
even without all the costumes.
But I tell you

1488
01:11:33,126 --> 01:11:35,195
what your real brilliance is,
and I don't even think

1489
01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:38,233
you know this.
It's that you write

1490
01:11:38,266 --> 01:11:40,067
every single one of your songs

1491
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:43,404
with the same four
God damn chords.

1492
01:11:43,438 --> 01:11:45,740
That means that any...
any 14-year-old kid

1493
01:11:45,773 --> 01:11:47,375
can go out there
and buy a guitar,

1494
01:11:47,408 --> 01:11:48,476
and within 20 minutes,

1495
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:50,110
they can be you!

1496
01:11:50,845 --> 01:11:53,414
And that matters, Gene.

1497
01:11:53,448 --> 01:11:55,182
That is who you are.

1498
01:11:56,183 --> 01:11:58,151
Now, why did you sign
with me, huh?

1499
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:02,690
Brand-new label
with you as our only act.

1500
01:12:02,724 --> 01:12:05,493
You had to know you were taking
as much of a risk as we were.

1501
01:12:07,428 --> 01:12:09,129
Because you
never should have gotten

1502
01:12:09,162 --> 01:12:11,131
out of the Brooklyn projects.

1503
01:12:15,168 --> 01:12:16,571
And yet, here you are.

1504
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,208
Here <i>we</i> are.

1505
01:12:21,442 --> 01:12:23,076
Two imposters.

1506
01:12:25,847 --> 01:12:27,382
Only if we're wrong.

1507
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:08,155
I get that you like to gamble,

1508
01:13:08,188 --> 01:13:10,458
but what if Joey was right?

1509
01:13:10,491 --> 01:13:12,560
In the end, what if the house
does always win?

1510
01:13:17,432 --> 01:13:18,900
Well, then we raise the stakes
so high

1511
01:13:18,933 --> 01:13:20,401
that we become the house.

1512
01:13:34,849 --> 01:13:36,384
Two hundred grand more.

1513
01:13:36,417 --> 01:13:38,553
You're still upside down
the last hundred.

1514
01:13:38,586 --> 01:13:41,188
Why don't you make it
a personal loan, then?

1515
01:13:41,222 --> 01:13:43,524
Don't do this.
You go upside down this big,

1516
01:13:43,558 --> 01:13:45,360
it don't matter
how much I fucking love you.

1517
01:13:45,393 --> 01:13:47,228
Hey, you ever gambled
yourself, Joey?

1518
01:13:47,261 --> 01:13:49,397
That thumping in your chest
right before that dealer

1519
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:51,833
turns over your next card?
Anything is possible

1520
01:13:51,866 --> 01:13:53,735
right before that moment.

1521
01:13:53,768 --> 01:13:55,603
Neil, I'm telling you,

1522
01:13:55,637 --> 01:13:58,506
I'm not gonna be here for you
this time if you don't pay off.

1523
01:13:58,539 --> 01:14:00,475
Are you gonna give me
the money or not?

1524
01:14:00,508 --> 01:14:01,542
No.

1525
01:14:04,879 --> 01:14:07,482
-Two hundred?
-Two hundred.

1526
01:14:20,862 --> 01:14:22,296
I know it's bad.

1527
01:14:23,431 --> 01:14:26,701
I just wish you would be honest
and tell me how bad.

1528
01:14:26,734 --> 01:14:28,336
It's... it's... it's fine.

1529
01:14:28,369 --> 01:14:30,203
No. It's not fine
We're not fine.

1530
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:32,507
None of this is fine, Neil.

1531
01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:34,542
We were fine when we were
on the floor of our home

1532
01:14:34,575 --> 01:14:36,811
in New Jersey, when I was
teaching you even how to read

1533
01:14:36,844 --> 01:14:39,280
those books.
And now, we are broke,

1534
01:14:39,313 --> 01:14:40,882
and you are giving
the guys bonuses!

1535
01:14:40,915 --> 01:14:42,450
Hey. No. Did you sister tell you

1536
01:14:42,483 --> 01:14:44,252
that Buck was the only one
that took it?

1537
01:14:44,285 --> 01:14:46,621
Maybe he was the only one
smart enough to.

1538
01:14:48,990 --> 01:14:51,592
Hey. Hey.

1539
01:14:53,995 --> 01:14:55,329
Come on.

1540
01:14:55,997 --> 01:14:57,498
Just dance with me.

1541
01:15:03,337 --> 01:15:04,605
Oh.

1542
01:15:07,675 --> 01:15:09,477
You stopped dreaming again.

1543
01:15:10,611 --> 01:15:12,714
You did.

1544
01:15:12,747 --> 01:15:14,716
You know what I dream of?

1545
01:15:14,749 --> 01:15:18,352
It's that you're actually here
with us, Neil,

1546
01:15:18,386 --> 01:15:20,021
and not in New York or Las Vegas

1547
01:15:20,054 --> 01:15:22,623
or wherever else
you disappear to

1548
01:15:22,657 --> 01:15:25,226
when you're too afraid
I'll see the truth.

1549
01:15:26,294 --> 01:15:29,297
What do you think the truth is?

1550
01:15:29,330 --> 01:15:32,800
Beth, I love you. Come on.
I'm always with you.

1551
01:15:32,834 --> 01:15:36,604
I'm always with you.
You, the kids,

1552
01:15:36,637 --> 01:15:38,306
you're all I think about.

1553
01:15:40,575 --> 01:15:45,480
You have to know she's going
to end up just as hurt as me.

1554
01:15:48,382 --> 01:15:50,618
I convinced myself for so long
that it was okay

1555
01:15:50,651 --> 01:15:53,054
when I knew that you were
sharing your bed, Neil,

1556
01:15:53,087 --> 01:15:55,490
but you are sharing your heart.

1557
01:15:58,059 --> 01:15:59,494
Tell me I'm wrong.

1558
01:16:09,670 --> 01:16:11,572
It's complicated.

1559
01:16:11,606 --> 01:16:12,607
No.

1560
01:16:13,875 --> 01:16:14,876
It's not.

1561
01:16:16,978 --> 01:16:18,513

Yeah, yeah. You good?

I'm great.

1569
01:16:40,935 --> 01:16:42,537
Oh, there he is. There he is.

1570
01:16:42,570 --> 01:16:45,406
-Is that what you gave me?
-That's it right there. Uh-uh.

1571
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:47,575
Hey, what up, Neil?
Look at the space in here...

1572
01:16:47,608 --> 01:16:49,710
I can't even feel
my lungs anymore.

1573
01:16:49,744 --> 01:16:50,878
Now it's a party.

1574
01:16:50,912 --> 01:16:53,581
George, George, George, George,
if we're gonna sign you,

1575
01:16:53,614 --> 01:16:55,616
you cannot be
your own opening act, alright?

1576
01:16:55,650 --> 01:16:59,387
You are Parliament and
Funkadelic. It's confusing.

1577
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:01,088
Only on some planets, man.

1578
01:17:01,122 --> 01:17:03,825
See, that's why I need
a motherfucking spaceship,

1579
01:17:03,858 --> 01:17:05,426
so we can leave this Earth.

1580
01:17:05,459 --> 01:17:07,428
When the mothership gets built,

1581
01:17:07,461 --> 01:17:09,864
the connection
between Earth and the galaxy

1582
01:17:09,897 --> 01:17:11,899
is gonna be made,
and everything will be clear.

1583
01:17:11,933 --> 01:17:14,402
I'm trying to tell you,
it'll make sense. You'll see.

1584
01:17:14,435 --> 01:17:16,437
How quickly can you cut us
this new record?

1585
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:20,007
How quick can you build me
a motherfucking spaceship?

1586
01:17:20,041 --> 01:17:21,542
How much?

1587
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:24,946
A million
motherfucking dollars.

1588
01:17:24,979 --> 01:17:26,848
Would those be Earth dollars?

1589
01:17:26,881 --> 01:17:29,584
I can't even feel
my bones anymore.

1590
01:17:29,617 --> 01:17:31,118
He's giving me space...

1591
01:17:31,152 --> 01:17:33,487
I know
what you need to do, Neil.

1592
01:17:33,521 --> 01:17:34,989
- It's party time.
- Yeah?

1593
01:17:35,022 --> 01:17:38,392
It's time to fly. I'm gonna need
you to hop on this ride with me.

1594
01:17:38,426 --> 01:17:40,661
If Buck can handle it, so can I.

1595
01:17:40,695 --> 01:17:42,396
You in or you out?

1596
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:43,865
I didn't start
the heavier drugs

1597
01:17:43,898 --> 01:17:46,734
because of what was going on
between Beth and Joyce.

1598
01:17:46,767 --> 01:17:49,503
Didn't start them
because of what was going wrong

1599
01:17:49,537 --> 01:17:51,138
with KISS and Donna
and Casablanca.

1600
01:17:51,172 --> 01:17:52,506
I just...

1601
01:17:54,575 --> 01:17:56,811
I did them because I like...

1602
01:17:56,844 --> 01:17:59,580
I liked how it made me feel.

1603
01:17:59,614 --> 01:18:01,782
Why don't you take
a ride with me, Neil?

1604
01:18:03,184 --> 01:18:04,952
Alright. Let's go, Neil.
It's on you.

1605
01:18:04,986 --> 01:18:06,187
Okay.

1606
01:18:06,221 --> 01:18:07,889
- You ready to go?
- Do it.

1607
01:18:07,922 --> 01:18:10,658
You ready to build us
a spaceship, Neil?

1608
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:13,628
Fuck it.

1609
01:18:15,630 --> 01:18:17,899
You look like you
like it. I think he likes it.

1610
01:18:23,104 --> 01:18:25,072
Let's build you
a motherfucking spaceship.

1611
01:18:26,807 --> 01:18:28,776

1612

That million dollars

and not just for the mothership.
George bought two new tour buses

1645
01:20:02,304 --> 01:20:04,005
and new cars for everyone
in the band.

1646
01:20:04,038 --> 01:20:05,940
Everyone, 28 of them.

1647
01:20:05,973 --> 01:20:08,310
We had Rolls Royces,
Mercedes Benz,

1648
01:20:08,343 --> 01:20:10,611
Jaguars, six Sevilles.

1649
01:20:10,644 --> 01:20:13,614
Everybody got a car,
except for me, motherfucker.

1650
01:20:13,647 --> 01:20:16,183

Hey. Not those.

1661

Those are the empty shells,
right?

1662
01:20:54,523 --> 01:20:57,259
- Hide them somewhere the back.
- Wait, wait. Empty?

1663
01:20:57,292 --> 01:20:58,427
-Yeah.
-Those are empty?

1664
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:00,928

Bill, is he...
is he serious?

1667
01:21:06,767 --> 01:21:09,136
Guys, uh, give us five.

1668
01:21:13,241 --> 01:21:15,243
-It's a bullshit trick.
-Bill.

1669
01:21:15,277 --> 01:21:17,678
Okay? It's a mirage.

1670
01:21:17,711 --> 01:21:20,815
And it sure as hell
isn't rock and roll, and...

1671
01:21:20,848 --> 01:21:21,849
and...

1672
01:21:22,817 --> 01:21:26,221
and I wish any of that
mattered right now,

1673
01:21:26,254 --> 01:21:27,822
but it just doesn't.

1674
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:33,828
Nobody's buying our records.
No one's coming to see us play.

1675
01:21:33,861 --> 01:21:36,864
And if an empty speaker cabinet
tricks people into thinking

1676
01:21:36,897 --> 01:21:40,402
that we sound better
because we sound louder...

1677
01:21:40,435 --> 01:21:42,404
If this is what it finally takes

1678
01:21:42,437 --> 01:21:45,706
so that everybody else
feels the way we do...

1679
01:21:46,308 --> 01:21:48,276
what I think is,

1680
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:50,010
we do what we have to
to survive.

1681
01:21:50,044 --> 01:21:51,879
It's just another part
of the show,

1682
01:21:51,912 --> 01:21:54,316
like the costumes,
the... the make-up.

1683
01:21:54,349 --> 01:21:55,683
No.

1684
01:21:56,884 --> 01:21:57,885
It's not.

1685
01:22:00,187 --> 01:22:01,722
It's a lie.

1686
01:22:03,225 --> 01:22:04,758

1687
01:22:13,767 --> 01:22:17,037
We've never lied
about the music.

1688
01:22:17,071 --> 01:22:18,739
Hey, uh,
why don't you, uh...

1689
01:22:18,772 --> 01:22:20,841

you liked it.

1691
01:22:22,910 --> 01:22:25,913
You said you liked it, right?

1713
01:23:32,347 --> 01:23:34,516
-Mm... no, we won't.
-No. No.

1714
01:23:34,549 --> 01:23:37,818
"Beth" just has a better...
I don't know.

1715
01:23:37,851 --> 01:23:39,954
It's just got
a better ring to it.

1716
01:23:39,987 --> 01:23:41,088
-Don't you think?
-Okay.

1717
01:23:41,121 --> 01:23:43,924
I think I finally got the
lights the way you want 'em.

1718
01:23:47,529 --> 01:23:48,996
What'd I miss?

1719
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:54,236
You know...

1720
01:23:56,538 --> 01:23:59,006
you guys are just a couple
of fucking children

1721
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:00,074
playing dress-up.

1722
01:24:03,010 --> 01:24:05,547
Aw, where you going? Come on.

1723
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:07,081
He bet everything on you!

1724
01:24:07,114 --> 01:24:10,050
No, no, no, no.
He bet everything on him!

1725
01:24:10,084 --> 01:24:12,287
We just happen to be
the cards he was dealt!

- Hey.
- Hey.

1740
01:25:46,681 --> 01:25:48,550
You look like shit.

1741
01:25:48,583 --> 01:25:50,452
You get in okay?

1742
01:25:50,485 --> 01:25:51,553
Limo was waiting?

1743
01:25:51,586 --> 01:25:52,953
Yeah, yeah. Like movie stars.

1744
01:25:52,986 --> 01:25:54,154
Your mother loved it.

1745
01:25:56,090 --> 01:25:57,625
Okay. How much you need
this time?

1746
01:25:57,659 --> 01:25:59,893
You got to talk to me
like that? I'm your father.

1747
01:25:59,927 --> 01:26:01,529
You think that's why we

1748
01:26:01,563 --> 01:26:03,431
flew in? I wanted to see
how my son's doing,

1749
01:26:03,465 --> 01:26:04,965
if he's okay.

1750
01:26:04,998 --> 01:26:07,000
What do you need, Pop?

1751
01:26:07,034 --> 01:26:09,371
It's for your mother, okay?
For the foster home.

1752
01:26:09,404 --> 01:26:10,971
She's going nuts.
I don't know.

1753
01:26:11,004 --> 01:26:12,507
Like, ten or something.

1754
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:14,975
You make it harder than getting
money from loan sharks.

1755
01:26:15,008 --> 01:26:17,612
It's just fucking money.

1756
01:26:17,645 --> 01:26:19,012
What is it you always say?

1757
01:26:19,046 --> 01:26:21,148
Uh, you just got to know
where to find it.

1758
01:26:21,181 --> 01:26:23,351
Like at the card tables?

1759
01:26:23,385 --> 01:26:24,918
I heard things, Neil.

1760
01:26:25,587 --> 01:26:27,555
What are you doing, huh?

1761
01:26:27,589 --> 01:26:30,225
Oh, you know,
just still trying to escape

1762
01:26:30,258 --> 01:26:32,460
-those four God damn blocks!
-What the fuck's

1763
01:26:32,494 --> 01:26:33,961
-the matter with you?
-Hey! Fuck!

1764
01:26:33,994 --> 01:26:35,463
Huh? I raised you to be smart!

1765
01:26:35,497 --> 01:26:38,132
How you gonna be smart
shoving that shit up your nose?

1766
01:26:38,165 --> 01:26:40,435
Come on! I'm talking to you!

1767
01:26:40,468 --> 01:26:41,703
How you gonna know
when you're hot,

1768
01:26:41,736 --> 01:26:43,471
when to bet big, when to fold?

1769
01:26:43,505 --> 01:26:46,374
You can't even decide who you
want in your fucking bed!

1770
01:26:47,475 --> 01:26:49,076
I have everything under control.

1771
01:26:49,109 --> 01:26:51,078
Doesn't look that way.

1772
01:26:51,111 --> 01:26:53,947
You've lost the music, kiddo.

1773
01:26:53,981 --> 01:26:56,984
Hey. You understand?

1774
01:26:59,554 --> 01:27:01,121
Is there anything else you need?

1775
01:27:09,731 --> 01:27:11,699
Hey, you don't think
you could have made it

1776
01:27:11,733 --> 01:27:13,167
using your real name?

1777
01:27:16,337 --> 01:27:17,439
Bogart is my real name.

1778
01:27:23,211 --> 01:27:24,178
Sure.

1779
01:27:47,602 --> 01:27:49,203
Tell me what I'm supposed to do.

1780
01:27:51,104 --> 01:27:53,208
Just keep dancing, Neil.

1781
01:27:54,275 --> 01:27:57,144
Always was the one thing
you were best at.

1782
01:28:00,281 --> 01:28:02,082
I did always love
the way you moved.

1783
01:28:02,115 --> 01:28:04,352
No. Just... I'm...
I'm asking you.

1784
01:28:04,385 --> 01:28:06,086
Just tell me
what I'm supposed to do.

1785
01:28:06,119 --> 01:28:08,088
Go and say goodbye to your kids.

1786
01:28:11,124 --> 01:28:12,660
That's what you're
supposed to do.

1787
01:28:18,633 --> 01:28:20,335
You're breaking my heart.

1788
01:28:22,804 --> 01:28:24,639
Hurts like hell, doesn't it?

1789
01:28:39,086 --> 01:28:41,289
She won't even put them
on the phone.

1790
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:43,224
My kids.

1791
01:28:48,496 --> 01:28:49,664
<i>My</i> kids.

1792
01:28:57,305 --> 01:28:59,741
I don't know how to stand up.

1793
01:28:59,774 --> 01:29:01,809
I'm just... I'm sitting here,

1794
01:29:01,843 --> 01:29:05,280
and I don't...
I don't know how to get up.

1795
01:29:17,190 --> 01:29:19,661
Hey, you can almost see
Brooklyn from here.

1796
01:29:32,407 --> 01:29:33,441
This is bullshit.

1797
01:29:33,474 --> 01:29:35,677
There isn't a thing that you
have ever asked for

1798
01:29:35,710 --> 01:29:37,144
that I haven't given you,

1799
01:29:37,177 --> 01:29:38,813
and you know
exactly how expensive it is

1800
01:29:38,846 --> 01:29:40,481
to keep you on tour
and in the studio!

1801
01:29:40,515 --> 01:29:42,584
Let's seriously talk about
releasing "Beth," okay...

1802
01:29:42,617 --> 01:29:44,719
No. No, no, no! We're not
releasing that shit. No.

1803
01:29:44,752 --> 01:29:46,321
...cross us over
into mainstream radio.

1804
01:29:46,354 --> 01:29:48,289
-It's not who we are.
-Nobody knows who you are,

1805
01:29:48,323 --> 01:29:50,224
which is why you're not making
any fucking money!

1806
01:29:50,258 --> 01:29:52,594
Isn't that your job? Huh?
To get them to know? And yours?

1807
01:29:52,627 --> 01:29:55,330
Or is that not the kinda pillow
talk you two like to talk?

1808
01:29:55,363 --> 01:29:56,497
- Jesus, Paul.
- What?

1809
01:29:56,531 --> 01:29:58,600
I'm just saying what everyone's
fucking thinking, man.

1810
01:29:58,633 --> 01:30:01,736
- No. Let him say it.
- It's just the truth.

1811
01:30:01,769 --> 01:30:02,870
You're our manager,

1812
01:30:02,904 --> 01:30:05,473
and you are fucking
the president

1813
01:30:05,506 --> 01:30:06,641
of our record company.

1814
01:30:08,643 --> 01:30:10,411
You're right. That is the truth,

1815
01:30:10,445 --> 01:30:12,347
which you didn't seem to mind
when you asked me

1816
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:15,283
to give him your demo.
You didn't mind either, Bill,

1817
01:30:15,316 --> 01:30:17,418
when you begged me
to convince Neil to sign us

1818
01:30:17,452 --> 01:30:20,421
even though Warner Brothers
begged him not to.

1819
01:30:20,455 --> 01:30:22,590
Or when you asked me
to get us on tour, Paul,

1820
01:30:22,624 --> 01:30:24,692
and keep us on tour.

1821
01:30:24,726 --> 01:30:27,662
You were all just fine asking me
to roll over on my pillow

1822
01:30:27,695 --> 01:30:30,431
and talk to the president
of your record company then.

1823
01:30:31,499 --> 01:30:32,500
Yes.

1824
01:30:32,533 --> 01:30:35,637
I <i>am</i> your manager,

1825
01:30:35,670 --> 01:30:38,439
and you know just how lucky
you are that I am,

1826
01:30:38,473 --> 01:30:40,541
because if I wasn't, you'd
still be trying to figure out

1827
01:30:40,575 --> 01:30:42,610
how to wear your mom's makeup,
'cause I taught you

1828
01:30:42,644 --> 01:30:43,711
how to do that, too.

1829
01:30:44,679 --> 01:30:47,281
Who I love is my business.

1830
01:30:47,315 --> 01:30:48,883
Your business is to make
the damn music.

1831
01:30:48,916 --> 01:30:50,251
-That's your job!
-No, no, no.

1832
01:30:50,284 --> 01:30:51,319
-Start doing it.
-No.

1833
01:30:51,352 --> 01:30:53,388
It doesn't matter how we got
here. This is real.

1834
01:30:53,421 --> 01:30:55,423
This is happening. This is
happening right fucking now.

1835
01:30:55,456 --> 01:30:58,393
-Tell them, Bill.
-You really want us to be

1836
01:30:58,426 --> 01:31:00,361
the hottest band in the world?

1837
01:31:01,629 --> 01:31:03,931
He better start paying us
like we already are.

1838
01:31:03,965 --> 01:31:05,333
There he is.

1839
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:07,935
There he is, folks,

1840
01:31:07,969 --> 01:31:09,202
Chaim Witz,

1841
01:31:09,237 --> 01:31:11,406
the demon
of rock and roll. Oh!

1842
01:31:11,439 --> 01:31:13,941
You want some
real money, Gene?

1843
01:31:13,975 --> 01:31:16,377
You want some real money?

1844
01:31:16,411 --> 01:31:18,312
Well, then you go out there

1845
01:31:18,346 --> 01:31:20,715
and you write
us a fucking song

1846
01:31:20,748 --> 01:31:23,785
that will actually
make us some!

1847
01:31:23,818 --> 01:31:24,919
- No, no, no.
- Wow!

1848
01:31:24,952 --> 01:31:27,288
-No, no, no, no, no.
-Fuck you.

1849
01:31:27,321 --> 01:31:28,956
You don't make it about them.
Not this time.

1850
01:31:28,990 --> 01:31:31,459
- Bill.
- Uh-uh. I am sorry.

1851
01:31:31,492 --> 01:31:35,463
We are renegotiating right
now, or we're leaving.

1852
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:40,968
Bill.

1853
01:31:41,002 --> 01:31:43,738
Okay. Okay.

1854
01:31:46,941 --> 01:31:49,911
How much?

1855
01:31:49,944 --> 01:31:51,546
A million dollars an album.

1856
01:31:54,916 --> 01:31:56,784
And another million
in tour support.

1857
01:31:58,019 --> 01:32:00,388
You want
two million dollars an album

1858
01:32:00,421 --> 01:32:03,291
for a band that can't sell
a... a fucking single?

1859
01:32:05,593 --> 01:32:09,797
I want two million dollars an
album for KISS.

1860
01:32:09,831 --> 01:32:10,832
Bill.

1861
01:32:20,074 --> 01:32:21,776
Okay. Fucking fine. Deal.

1862
01:32:24,512 --> 01:32:25,513
We finished?

1863
01:32:30,985 --> 01:32:32,720
It's just business.

1864
01:32:32,754 --> 01:32:33,988
It's nothing personal.

1865
01:32:34,021 --> 01:32:36,491
Of course it is,
and you fucking know it.

1866
01:32:39,093 --> 01:32:40,461
It's okay.

1867
01:33:11,726 --> 01:33:14,061
And now, ladies
and gentlemen,

1868
01:33:14,095 --> 01:33:17,598
here's Johnny!

1869
01:33:17,632 --> 01:33:20,968
Here he is, Lenny Bruce!

1870
01:33:21,002 --> 01:33:22,537
Maybe you should slow down
a little.

1871
01:33:22,570 --> 01:33:23,971
Maybe you should speed up
a lot.

1872
01:33:27,108 --> 01:33:29,977
Hey! I love Lenny Bruce.

1873
01:33:30,011 --> 01:33:32,947
Did you know that he was 40
when he died?

1874
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:34,849
You think it was worth it,
dying so young

1875
01:33:34,882 --> 01:33:37,418
but then having
all that success?

1876
01:33:37,451 --> 01:33:40,955
No. I think dying old
and having all that success

1877
01:33:40,988 --> 01:33:43,024
would be worth it.

1878
01:33:43,057 --> 01:33:44,759
You promised our distributors
a sure thing

1879
01:33:44,792 --> 01:33:47,829
so they'll keep letting us ride
on everything else.

1880
01:33:47,862 --> 01:33:49,063
Well, it's Johnny Carson.

1881
01:33:49,096 --> 01:33:51,532
It is a sure thing.

1882
01:33:51,566 --> 01:33:55,903
Besides, a bet is only a bet
if it matters.

1883
01:34:03,544 --> 01:34:05,379
It's a wedding night,

1884
01:34:05,413 --> 01:34:07,849
and you're both virgins.
It's disgusting.

1885
01:34:07,882 --> 01:34:09,350
Abe, Abe...

1886
01:34:10,585 --> 01:34:13,588
You don't mean that.
No, because it's me, Abe,

1887
01:34:13,621 --> 01:34:15,523
because you've always trusted..

1888
01:34:18,593 --> 01:34:20,528
-Talk to me.
-They're not waiting for Carson.

1889
01:34:20,561 --> 01:34:21,863
-What?
-They're returning

1890
01:34:21,896 --> 01:34:24,465
all the unsold KISS albums
and Donna and Parliament.

1891
01:34:24,498 --> 01:34:25,533
-Everything.
-That's

1892
01:34:25,566 --> 01:34:27,735
-too many fucking records, man.
-No shit, Buck.

1893
01:34:27,768 --> 01:34:29,770
-What do we do?
-We take 'em back,

1894
01:34:29,804 --> 01:34:31,739
but you tell
every single fucking one of them

1895
01:34:31,772 --> 01:34:33,908
if they do,
they don't get Carson!

1896
01:34:33,941 --> 01:34:35,743
Neil. Neil!

1897
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:36,544
What?

1898
01:34:38,512 --> 01:34:40,681
What if we're wrong
about Carson?

1899
01:34:40,715 --> 01:34:43,618
I mean,
we're shipping gold. More.

1900
01:34:43,651 --> 01:34:46,554
Over 750,000 copies already.

1901
01:34:46,587 --> 01:34:47,822
And with the money
we're spending

1902
01:34:47,855 --> 01:34:49,724
on... on commercials
and... and print ads...

1903
01:34:49,757 --> 01:34:53,027
-It's Johnny fucking Carson!
-And nobody understands

1904
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:54,896
why the hell
we're even doing it!

1905
01:34:54,929 --> 01:34:56,564
Then ship more!

1906
01:34:56,597 --> 01:34:58,766
Spend more! Do you job
and make them understand!

1907
01:34:58,799 --> 01:35:00,768
This is gonna be
the biggest fucking album

1908
01:35:00,801 --> 01:35:02,503
of the year, okay, folks?

1909
01:35:02,536 --> 01:35:03,804
You've lost your mind.

1910
01:35:03,838 --> 01:35:06,107
Did you not hear
what they said on the phone?

1911
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:08,009
And they're on our fucking side!

1912
01:35:08,042 --> 01:35:10,778
-Nobody is on our fucking side.
-Because nobody understands

1913
01:35:10,811 --> 01:35:13,781
what the fuck
you're doing anymore!

1914
01:35:13,814 --> 01:35:15,549
Not even me!

1915
01:35:17,485 --> 01:35:19,921
We were wrong
about KISS, Neil,

1916
01:35:19,954 --> 01:35:22,189
and we were wrong about Donna.

1917
01:35:22,224 --> 01:35:24,792
Even George
and his fucking spaceship.

1918
01:35:25,826 --> 01:35:28,529
We were just wrong!

1919
01:35:28,562 --> 01:35:32,066
And here we are, still betting
money we don't even have

1920
01:35:32,099 --> 01:35:33,801
on them!

1921
01:35:33,834 --> 01:35:35,436
I can't even pay my...

1922
01:35:36,971 --> 01:35:38,472
If we're wrong about Carson...

1923
01:35:38,506 --> 01:35:41,108
We are not fucking wrong, Cec,

1924
01:35:41,142 --> 01:35:42,843
not about any of them.

1925
01:35:43,711 --> 01:35:45,947
We just haven't figured out

1926
01:35:45,980 --> 01:35:48,783
a way to finally be right!

1927
01:35:50,285 --> 01:35:51,953
-What the hell's happening?

1928
01:35:51,986 --> 01:35:54,722
I dared question the postman's
son from Brooklyn,

1929
01:35:54,755 --> 01:35:56,157
and he didn't like
what he heard.

1930
01:35:56,190 --> 01:35:57,292
Oh, is that right, Cec?

1931
01:35:57,326 --> 01:35:59,760
Is that the same postman's son
been carrying your ass

1932
01:35:59,794 --> 01:36:02,163
from nowhere to somewhere
your whole fucking career?

1933
01:36:02,196 --> 01:36:03,130
-Excuse me?
-Tell me this.

1934
01:36:03,164 --> 01:36:04,899
Did you believe
we would make it this far?

1935
01:36:04,932 --> 01:36:06,834
Now, be honest.
Do you believe that we could

1936
01:36:06,867 --> 01:36:09,670
actually go further?
So, you do your fucking job,

1937
01:36:09,704 --> 01:36:12,139
and I will go get
the fucking money!

1938
01:36:12,173 --> 01:36:13,607
Uh...

1939
01:36:17,645 --> 01:36:19,847
He didn't mean that.

1940
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:21,882
Cec. Shit.

1941
01:36:21,916 --> 01:36:24,585
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

1942
01:36:24,618 --> 01:36:28,489
here's Johnny!

1943
01:36:31,192 --> 01:36:33,194
The Carson album's
still considered

1944
01:36:33,228 --> 01:36:35,096
one of the biggest disasters
ever conceived

1945
01:36:35,129 --> 01:36:36,365
in the record business.

1946
01:36:36,398 --> 01:36:39,267
The joke was that we'd shipped
gold but returned platinum.

1947
01:36:39,301 --> 01:36:41,269
Just... wasn't a joke.

1948
01:36:41,303 --> 01:36:42,803
We'd given away
so many promo copies

1949
01:36:42,837 --> 01:36:44,905
that when the stores started
returning them to get

1950
01:36:44,939 --> 01:36:47,875
their money back, we were
on the line for every last one,

1951
01:36:47,908 --> 01:36:50,011
and it was killing us,

1952
01:36:50,044 --> 01:36:52,680
killing us, because I was wrong.

1953
01:36:53,714 --> 01:36:56,218
Biggest sin of a record man...

1954
01:36:56,251 --> 01:36:58,652
believing in something
because you have to...

1955
01:37:00,322 --> 01:37:01,889
not because you do.

1956
01:37:08,763 --> 01:37:11,665
I fucking begged you
to pay back that money, Neil.

1957
01:37:11,699 --> 01:37:13,768
You kept sayin',
"Waiting for Carson."

1958
01:37:13,801 --> 01:37:15,703
And I convinced them to wait,

1959
01:37:15,736 --> 01:37:17,905
because this is me and you,

1960
01:37:17,938 --> 01:37:19,774
but they're done waiting.

1961
01:37:19,807 --> 01:37:21,042
I'm sorry.

1962
01:37:21,075 --> 01:37:24,312
It's okay, Joe. Just tell them

1963
01:37:24,346 --> 01:37:26,680
not the arm
I sign contracts with.

1964
01:37:30,718 --> 01:37:33,020
I remembered my dad,

1965
01:37:33,054 --> 01:37:34,222
remembered my promise

1966
01:37:34,256 --> 01:37:36,324
to never become
anything like him.

1967
01:37:36,358 --> 01:37:40,027
I just... can't remember
the exact moment when I did.

1968
01:37:41,962 --> 01:37:43,697
Egg cream?

1969
01:37:47,369 --> 01:37:50,305
Just get us
the fucking money, Neil.

1970
01:37:50,338 --> 01:37:51,806
I fucking hate LA.

1971
01:37:58,346 --> 01:38:00,047
- Jesus.
- Neil!

1972
01:38:00,081 --> 01:38:01,082
Jesus.

1973
01:38:02,317 --> 01:38:06,087
It's not that he was a postman.
It's just...

1974
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:08,290
I knew that he knew
that's all he was ever gonna be.

1975
01:38:12,726 --> 01:38:14,128
-Here.
-I'm scared.

1976
01:38:14,161 --> 01:38:16,163
-Come on. Shh.
-I'm scared.

1977
01:38:16,197 --> 01:38:19,700
Shh. Just our little secret,
brother.

1978
01:38:26,308 --> 01:38:28,075
Can we get something
to clean him up?

1979
01:38:29,677 --> 01:38:31,379
-You want a cigarette?
-You're alright.

1980
01:38:31,413 --> 01:38:33,281
It's okay.

1981
01:38:33,315 --> 01:38:34,715
Okay. Come on.

1982
01:38:34,748 --> 01:38:36,384
Get him up. Walk it off.
Walk it off.

1983
01:38:36,418 --> 01:38:37,785
Oh, fuck.

1984
01:38:38,953 --> 01:38:40,121
-Come on.
-Fuck.

1985
01:38:58,406 --> 01:39:00,774
If we can't sell enough KISS
records on our own,

1986
01:39:00,808 --> 01:39:02,977
then folks,
we are gonna need an army.

1987
01:39:03,010 --> 01:39:06,680
-It's merchandise, Nelly.
-It's a movement, Nance.

1988
01:39:06,714 --> 01:39:08,682
I love KISS, but how the fuck
are we gonna get people

1989
01:39:08,716 --> 01:39:11,152
to buy shit about the album
and we can't even get them

1990
01:39:11,185 --> 01:39:12,254
to buy the fucking album?

1991
01:39:12,287 --> 01:39:14,422
Because KISS has always been
about the experience,

1992
01:39:14,456 --> 01:39:16,291
Buck, and that is where
we have failed.

1993
01:39:16,324 --> 01:39:17,892
If you're not in
the KISS Army, oh,

1994
01:39:17,925 --> 01:39:19,327
then you are not
in the KISS Army!

1995
01:39:19,361 --> 01:39:21,229
You don't get
the limited edition posters,

1996
01:39:21,263 --> 01:39:22,430
the signed T-shirts,
the comic books!

1997
01:39:22,464 --> 01:39:26,967
-So we have comic books now?
-Yes, created specifically

1998
01:39:27,001 --> 01:39:28,002
for the KISS Army,

1999
01:39:28,035 --> 01:39:30,438
and the only way to get
into the KISS Army...

2000
01:39:30,472 --> 01:39:32,139
- Is to buy their albums.
- Thank you.

2001
01:39:32,173 --> 01:39:34,309
Now, we have one very important
question to answer:

2002
01:39:34,342 --> 01:39:36,478
What color do we paint
the building?

2003
01:39:36,511 --> 01:39:38,779
Hundred bucks to whoever gets
the... the best color.

2004
01:39:38,812 --> 01:39:42,183
Okay. Can we just, um...
Can we just get a minute?

2005
01:39:42,217 --> 01:39:43,851
Thank you. Thank you so much.

2006
01:39:43,884 --> 01:39:45,886
What about black?
Can you imagine

2007
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:49,190
the whole fucking block
was painted fucking black?

2008
01:39:50,492 --> 01:39:51,792
-No, I can't.
-Oh.

2009
01:39:51,825 --> 01:39:53,928
Neil, you are my brother,

2010
01:39:53,961 --> 01:39:55,829
and if you want me to go
off this cliff with you,

2011
01:39:55,863 --> 01:39:57,131
I'll even be the first to jump,

2012
01:39:57,164 --> 01:40:00,968
but you have got to help me
understand why.

2013
01:40:01,001 --> 01:40:04,339
-We are broke.
-Yes. Yes. That is exactly

2014
01:40:04,372 --> 01:40:06,073
what all of these fuckers
are saying.

2015
01:40:06,106 --> 01:40:08,876
So, by tomorrow,
I want an entire crew...

2016
01:40:08,909 --> 01:40:11,812
no, two crews outside,
painting the entire block,

2017
01:40:11,845 --> 01:40:13,781
and I want you to pay them extra
to do it slowly.

2018
01:40:13,814 --> 01:40:15,749
The longer
they're out there working, oh,

2019
01:40:15,783 --> 01:40:19,086
the longer people are just
gonna drive by and see 'em.

2020
01:40:19,119 --> 01:40:21,256
-See 'em doing what?
-Painting the building.

2021
01:40:22,823 --> 01:40:24,426
We're gonna place one
final bet.

2022
01:40:24,459 --> 01:40:25,793
On who?

2023
01:40:26,428 --> 01:40:27,828
On us.

2024
01:40:29,830 --> 01:40:31,799
It started with a makeover
of the building,

2025
01:40:31,832 --> 01:40:34,236
but to the town, we were
building our own makeover.

2026
01:40:34,269 --> 01:40:36,238
I mean, every day,
we'd announce a new promotion,

2027
01:40:36,271 --> 01:40:38,772
but in real life, we were
just swapping titles around

2028
01:40:38,806 --> 01:40:41,141
like the paint colors
of the building.

2029
01:40:41,175 --> 01:40:43,877
We called everyone we owed,
hyped every plan we had,

2030
01:40:43,911 --> 01:40:45,846
making most of it up
as we went along.

2031
01:40:45,879 --> 01:40:47,349
-We made them root for us...
-Mo.

2032
01:40:47,382 --> 01:40:48,916
...not against us.

2033
01:40:48,949 --> 01:40:50,985
Where the fuck
is all the money coming from?

2034
01:40:51,018 --> 01:40:53,521
Nowhere. There was none.
We... we just made everyone

2035
01:40:53,555 --> 01:40:56,156
believe there was.
We bet everything we had

2036
01:40:56,190 --> 01:40:58,993
on everyone
we already believed in.

Have a nice flight back.

2079

My real name's not Bogart.

2080
01:43:28,209 --> 01:43:31,078
I changed it, actually,
a couple times.

2081
01:43:31,111 --> 01:43:33,080
Was, uh, Neil Scott
when I was a singer,

2082
01:43:33,113 --> 01:43:36,016
Neil Stewart when I worked
for a modeling agency,

2083
01:43:36,049 --> 01:43:40,221
uh, Wayne Roberts
when I did a soft porn film.

2084
01:43:41,322 --> 01:43:42,257
You made pornography?

2085
01:43:42,290 --> 01:43:45,427
Well, to afford
my wife's engagement ring.

2086
01:43:45,460 --> 01:43:47,027
Okay.
So, you did a dirty film

2087
01:43:47,060 --> 01:43:48,730
so that you could ask
your wife to marry you?

2088
01:43:48,763 --> 01:43:52,099
The point of the... Yes.
The point of the story

2089
01:43:52,132 --> 01:43:55,236
is that we can be
whoever we want to be.

2090
01:43:55,270 --> 01:43:58,172
Hmm. Well, that may be the point
of your story, but not mine.

2091
01:43:58,205 --> 01:44:01,609
It's the point
of everyone's story, LaDonna,

2092
01:44:01,643 --> 01:44:03,211
especially yours.

2093
01:44:05,246 --> 01:44:07,114
Why didn't people like the song?

2094
01:44:08,716 --> 01:44:11,084
-I liked it.
-No. I mean, why didn't...

2095
01:44:11,118 --> 01:44:13,254
No. I... I know
what you meant. I...

2096
01:44:15,757 --> 01:44:18,058
And the answer
is that they didn't get it,

2097
01:44:18,091 --> 01:44:20,127
because I failed to get them to.

2098
01:44:22,196 --> 01:44:24,265
So, then why are you here?
Giorgio told me

2099
01:44:24,299 --> 01:44:26,734
that he wanted me to cut
the same song again.

2100
01:44:26,768 --> 01:44:29,136
-I don't understand.
-You don't have to, okay?

2101
01:44:29,169 --> 01:44:31,339
You just have to trust
that I do.

2102
01:44:31,372 --> 01:44:32,674
I don't even know you.

2103
01:44:32,707 --> 01:44:34,709
But I know you,

2104
01:44:34,742 --> 01:44:38,746
LaDonna... Adrian... Gaines.

2105
01:44:38,780 --> 01:44:40,582
Grew up singing in a choir.

2106
01:44:40,615 --> 01:44:43,218
Raised by your mom in Boston.

2107
01:44:45,118 --> 01:44:48,088
You heard your voice
raising all the way up

2108
01:44:48,121 --> 01:44:49,757
to the top
of those stained glass windows,

2109
01:44:49,791 --> 01:44:53,228
and you let yourself believe
that you could be more

2110
01:44:53,261 --> 01:44:56,364
than just that girl in a church.

2111
01:44:56,397 --> 01:44:57,565
And now, here you are,

2112
01:44:57,599 --> 01:44:59,234
performing
halfway across the world,

2113
01:44:59,267 --> 01:45:03,438
getting further and further away
from that stained glass.

2114
01:45:05,773 --> 01:45:07,308
And every night...

2115
01:45:09,142 --> 01:45:12,079
you close your eyes,

2116
01:45:12,112 --> 01:45:16,518
dreaming that maybe someone
will come along...

2117
01:45:17,852 --> 01:45:20,153
and give you one last chance.

2118
01:45:23,123 --> 01:45:25,660
Now, you tell me I'm wrong,

2119
01:45:25,693 --> 01:45:27,328
and I'm on the next plane.

2120
01:45:32,767 --> 01:45:34,101
Why me?

2121
01:45:36,136 --> 01:45:38,606
Because I have never heard

2122
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:42,142
a voice like yours.

2123
01:45:46,681 --> 01:45:48,383

over and over again?

It's just one lyric, Neil!

01:50:44,512 --> 01:50:47,582
Frankie.... I brought mine.

2217
01:50:47,615 --> 01:50:49,383
Now, you ain't had those
last night.

2218
01:50:49,417 --> 01:50:52,453
-I didn't need them last night.
-Hey, how about you take

2219
01:50:52,486 --> 01:50:54,856
a bathroom break, Frankie?
We'll take over from here.

2220
01:50:54,889 --> 01:50:55,923
-Come on.
-Whoo!

2221
01:50:55,957 --> 01:50:57,425
I gotta be
out of my fucking mind.

2222
01:50:57,458 --> 01:50:59,060
-You're in your mind.
-You're about to be

2223
01:50:59,093 --> 01:51:01,662

01:51:03,664 --> 01:51:05,600
Looks like you got two,
motherfucker.

2226
01:51:29,557 --> 01:51:31,659
Sixteen minutes and 50 seconds.

2227
01:51:31,692 --> 01:51:33,461
With the record
glued to the turntable,

2228
01:51:33,494 --> 01:51:35,563
it played all night long
with Frankie still locked

2229
01:51:35,596 --> 01:51:37,698
in the bathroom.
Lawyers were calling

2230
01:51:37,732 --> 01:51:39,200
even before we landed
back in LA,

2231
01:51:39,234 --> 01:51:42,036
swearing they'd never play
a Casablanca record again,

2232
01:51:42,069 --> 01:51:45,940
except... something happened,

2233
01:51:45,973 --> 01:51:47,842
something that never had before.

Stations all across the country

to find a way to play her.

2236
01:51:52,813 --> 01:51:54,682
-Tell them I'll buy them all.
-Buy what all?

2237
01:51:54,715 --> 01:51:57,018
-The whole half-hour block.
-On every station.

2321
01:56:43,271 --> 01:56:45,906
That voice, the way Donna
would just flow inside you,

2322
01:56:45,940 --> 01:56:49,143
that came from something
far more inventive than me,

2323
01:56:49,176 --> 01:56:51,178
but the First Lady Of Love?

Let's replace Gladys with Donna.

2327
01:56:56,518 --> 01:56:58,185
And suddenly,
for the first time,

2328
01:56:58,220 --> 01:57:01,489
it wasn't just breaking one hit,
because once Donna broke,

2329
01:57:01,523 --> 01:57:03,924
the hits
just never stopped coming.

2330
01:57:04,959 --> 01:57:06,494
I knew what else
we'd did wrong, too.

2331
01:57:09,897 --> 01:57:11,865
Recording a live album
of greatest hits

2332
01:57:11,899 --> 01:57:13,401
from a band
who doesn't even have one?

2333
01:57:13,435 --> 01:57:16,504
-That's new, Neil, even for us.
-Hey, they've always had hits.

2334
01:57:16,538 --> 01:57:18,306
We just failed to record them
in the way

2335
01:57:18,340 --> 01:57:20,542
they needed to be heard.

2336
01:57:20,575 --> 01:57:22,142
By recording KISS live,

2337
01:57:22,176 --> 01:57:27,081
we finally captured
the experience of KISS live...

2338
01:57:27,114 --> 01:57:29,950
which is what we'd really been
chasing from the very beginning.

2339
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:32,820
Turned out, we'd been right
about them, too.

2340
01:57:35,055 --> 01:57:37,325
We sold
over nine million records.

2341
01:57:37,359 --> 01:57:38,859
Every bet we'd made,

2342
01:57:38,892 --> 01:57:40,828
we were right about all of them.

2343
01:57:40,861 --> 01:57:43,531
We just... needed enough time

2344
01:57:43,565 --> 01:57:46,434

to catch up to us.

2354
01:58:13,428 --> 01:58:16,598
No. No. That is too much.

2355
01:58:16,631 --> 01:58:19,567
I can only do all this
because you taught me.

2356
01:58:19,601 --> 01:58:21,603
Who taught you?
I taught you nothing.

2357
01:58:21,636 --> 01:58:24,539
-Taught you how to lose.
-No, you taught me how to win.

2358
01:58:24,572 --> 01:58:26,541
You taught me
to swing for the trees,

2359
01:58:26,574 --> 01:58:29,176
to bet big to win big.
You remember?

2360
01:58:30,278 --> 01:58:31,346
You taught me how to dream!

2361
01:58:34,616 --> 01:58:36,183
Maybe a little bit.

2362
01:58:36,217 --> 01:58:39,454
No. Maybe a lot.

2363
01:58:44,359 --> 01:58:46,894
And you know, maybe you were
just a little unlucky.

2364
01:58:47,928 --> 01:58:50,097
Right? Well, I got your luck.

2365
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:55,337
Ah. Nah.

2366
01:58:55,370 --> 01:58:57,339
You made your own luck.

2367

01:59:31,138 --> 01:59:33,575
keep the beat,
let's just fucking spell, okay?

2375
01:59:33,608 --> 01:59:36,644
That's right. We created
the Village People, too.

2376
01:59:36,678 --> 01:59:38,112
"YMCA" became

2377
01:59:38,145 --> 01:59:40,382
one of the all-time
biggest selling singles,

2378
01:59:40,415 --> 01:59:42,116
more than ten million copies,

2379
01:59:42,149 --> 01:59:43,651
though other than the cop,

2380
01:59:43,685 --> 01:59:45,687
none of the others even sang,
not on the records,

2381
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:47,522
not at the concerts, not ever.

2382
01:59:47,555 --> 01:59:48,690
Again. Let's go again.

2383
01:59:48,723 --> 01:59:50,991

2384
01:59:51,024 --> 01:59:52,993

on the brink of bankruptcy

2385
01:59:53,026 --> 01:59:55,129

on the <i>Destroyer</i> album.

2390
02:00:03,170 --> 02:00:05,005
It would hurt
every single time I heard it,

2391
02:00:05,038 --> 02:00:07,409
but it was the smash
we'd been chasing

2392
02:00:07,442 --> 02:00:08,942
since it all began.

2393
02:00:08,976 --> 02:00:11,212
Now, this is a love story.

2394

even with all her success,

2406
02:00:53,321 --> 02:00:55,590
I don't really believe
LaDonna Adrian Gaines

2407
02:00:55,623 --> 02:00:58,025
ever really became Donna Summer.

2408
02:00:58,058 --> 02:01:00,328
We just made you all think
that she had.

2409
02:01:00,361 --> 02:01:02,330
So, truth is, none of us

2410
02:01:02,363 --> 02:01:04,599
were still who we'd been
when it all began.

2411
02:01:04,632 --> 02:01:07,134
Casablanca had become
something else.

2412
02:01:07,167 --> 02:01:10,037
I had become something else.

2413
02:01:10,070 --> 02:01:12,740
Okay, Neil.
What's this all about?

2414
02:01:12,774 --> 02:01:15,175
We sold half the company
to Polygram.

2415
02:01:15,210 --> 02:01:18,446
Forty-nine percent.
We still keep control.

2416
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:22,149
We've lived an awful lotta
years pretending to be rich.

2417
02:01:22,182 --> 02:01:23,585
You wanna see
what it feels like

2418
02:01:23,618 --> 02:01:26,621
when we finally actually are?

2419
02:01:26,654 --> 02:01:28,021
Nelly!

2420
02:01:29,390 --> 02:01:31,459
Jesus Christ.

2421
02:01:31,493 --> 02:01:33,795
Um, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I never use the Lord's name

2422
02:01:33,828 --> 02:01:35,463
in vain, but...

2423
02:01:35,497 --> 02:01:39,467
Fifty million dollars
for just half the company,

2424
02:01:39,501 --> 02:01:43,103
made out to Neil Bogart,

2425
02:01:43,136 --> 02:01:46,307
a name and a life
I'd made up along the way.

2426
02:01:49,142 --> 02:01:52,112
Even paid Mo back every penny.

2427
02:01:52,145 --> 02:01:55,182
Not because I had to,
but because I could.

2428
02:02:30,552 --> 02:02:32,754
My dad had been right.

2429
02:02:32,787 --> 02:02:34,222
Most were all still there

2430
02:02:34,255 --> 02:02:36,691
on the same four blocks
of their lives.

2431
02:02:52,607 --> 02:02:54,409
For those of you who don't know,

2432
02:02:54,442 --> 02:02:59,146
I left Casablanca finally
on February 8, 1980.

2433
02:02:59,179 --> 02:03:01,215
It was a Friday.

2434
02:03:01,249 --> 02:03:03,751
It was five days
after my 37th birthday.

2435
02:03:03,785 --> 02:03:06,521
Now, disco had officially died
the year before when a local DJ

2436
02:03:06,554 --> 02:03:09,122
set a bunch of records on fire
to the roar of a crowd

2437
02:03:09,156 --> 02:03:12,860
as if that was
a fucking concert.

2438
02:03:12,894 --> 02:03:15,229
Yeah. It was a good bet
most of those were ours.

2439
02:03:18,165 --> 02:03:20,234
Now, all of you remember,
I'm sure,

2440
02:03:20,268 --> 02:03:23,705
Donna and KISS and George,

2441
02:03:23,738 --> 02:03:25,707
Village People, Gladys,

2442
02:03:25,740 --> 02:03:27,375
the Isleys, Bill Withers,

2443
02:03:27,408 --> 02:03:28,443
all the others.

2444
02:03:30,244 --> 02:03:32,179
But I bet each of you $100...

2445
02:03:33,381 --> 02:03:36,651
that not one of you
has ever even heard of my name.

2446
02:03:36,684 --> 02:03:39,354
And that's okay. It's not like
I had the talent that they did,

2447
02:03:39,387 --> 02:03:41,923
because I didn't, you know,

2448
02:03:41,956 --> 02:03:45,727
or that I... or that I mattered
like they did,

2449
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:49,631
because, uh... I... I couldn'.

2450
02:03:52,834 --> 02:03:54,702
But I sure as hell
made you dance.

2451
02:03:56,537 --> 02:03:58,406
I sold over
200 million records,

2452
02:03:58,439 --> 02:04:01,542
and all that music
that I helped made possible...

2453
02:04:04,312 --> 02:04:07,415
became the soundtrack
of your lives.

2454
02:04:11,319 --> 02:04:15,556
And we... we were in the
business of making dreams come
true.s

2455
02:04:17,925 --> 02:04:19,293
Didn't we do that?

2456
02:04:20,995 --> 02:04:23,698
And if we did,
didn't... didn't that matter?

2457
02:04:26,668 --> 02:04:27,702
Didn't I?

2458
02:04:30,705 --> 02:04:35,543
Even if... even if only a song?

2459
02:04:44,485 --> 02:04:45,486
I died...

2460
02:04:47,588 --> 02:04:50,758
May eighth, just two years
later, from cancer.

2461
02:04:52,827 --> 02:04:54,495
I was only 39 years old.

2462
02:05:00,301 --> 02:05:05,673
I... I wouldn't change
a fucking thing.

2463
02:05:09,877 --> 02:05:12,714
I just wish I had more time.

02:12:32,420 --> 02:12:33,622
You had a lot of resilience.

2588
02:12:33,654 --> 02:12:36,824
You have been up and down,
and you've made a lot of money.

2589
02:12:36,857 --> 02:12:39,327
And you've been
flat on your bum.

2590
02:12:39,361 --> 02:12:42,297
- It's nicer being up.
- Yes.

2591
02:12:42,330 --> 02:12:45,866
If that was the question.

2592
02:12:45,900 --> 02:12:48,202
Why your resiliency?
Where does it come from?

2593
02:12:48,236 --> 02:12:50,104
Where's that drive come from?

2594
02:12:50,137 --> 02:12:52,039
Probably, it originally comes
from Brooklyn.

2595
02:12:52,072 --> 02:12:54,074
- Brooklyn.
- You know, all people

2596
02:12:54,108 --> 02:12:57,778
that are born in Brooklyn seem
to be able to bounce back,

2597
02:12:57,811 --> 02:12:59,980
because you have to
if you come from there.

2598
02:13:00,014 --> 02:13:04,352
You have to have the desire
to succeed and be a gambler,

2599
02:13:04,386 --> 02:13:07,821
and I both have the desire
and am a gambler.

2600
02:13:07,855 --> 02:13:09,089
So, you were poor?

2601
02:13:09,123 --> 02:13:10,225
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm

2602
02:13:11,526 --> 02:13:13,127
I came from Brooklyn,

2603
02:13:13,160 --> 02:13:16,897
and I used to sing on
the street corners and stuff.

2604
02:13:16,931 --> 02:13:20,000
Do you think... I mean, what
does it take to be a greaser?

2605
02:13:20,034 --> 02:13:21,835
-I mean...
-You got what it takes.

2606
02:13:21,869 --> 02:13:23,338
You probably got what it takes.

2607
02:13:23,371 --> 02:13:26,173
What do you think is
the biggest misunderstanding

2608
02:13:26,207 --> 02:13:27,174
about Neil Bogart?

2609
02:13:35,783 --> 02:13:37,485
There are quite a few
misunderstandings

2610
02:13:37,519 --> 02:13:39,287
about Neil Bogart.

2611
02:13:41,021 --> 02:13:43,791
If you feel like rocking
the Hollywood Bowl,

2612
02:13:43,824 --> 02:13:45,993
it feels like being rocked.

2613
02:13:56,070 --> 02:13:58,373
How'd you get
so down and out, Neil?

2614
02:13:58,406 --> 02:13:59,974
I came out to California

2615
02:14:00,007 --> 02:14:02,544
after having a company
called Buddah Records

2616
02:14:02,577 --> 02:14:04,246
in New York City,

2617
02:14:04,279 --> 02:14:06,981
which was very successful,
and I went into partnership

2618
02:14:07,014 --> 02:14:09,351
with Warners Brothers Records.

2619
02:14:09,384 --> 02:14:10,918
Inside of eight months,

2620
02:14:10,951 --> 02:14:13,521
the partnership
had just about dissolved,

2621
02:14:13,555 --> 02:14:16,790
and I lost the quickest
three million dollars

2622
02:14:16,824 --> 02:14:18,993
anybody ever put up
for anybody else.

2623
02:14:19,026 --> 02:14:20,528
What does it feel like
to lose

2624
02:14:20,562 --> 02:14:21,929
a couple of million dollars?

2625
02:14:21,962 --> 02:14:23,897
Well, the strange thing is,

2626
02:14:23,931 --> 02:14:26,000
I really didn't have it,
you know?

2627
02:14:26,033 --> 02:14:27,901
Of course.

2628
02:14:27,935 --> 02:14:31,138
I don't think if I had it,
I could have taken the risk.

2629
02:14:31,171 --> 02:14:34,409
You know,
it was a kind of situation

2630
02:14:34,442 --> 02:14:38,546
where I just kept going and
really didn't stop to think

2631
02:14:38,580 --> 02:14:40,881
of how I was going
to pay it back.

2632
02:14:40,914 --> 02:14:43,884
And fortunately, success
was around the corner,

2633
02:14:43,917 --> 02:14:46,588
and I was able to pay it back
and come from behind.

2634
02:14:46,621 --> 02:14:48,290
You did it by giving,
first of all,

2635
02:14:48,323 --> 02:14:50,592
one of the largest parties
ever given in this town,

2636
02:14:50,625 --> 02:14:52,893
-didn't you?
-Yes, it was.

2637
02:14:52,926 --> 02:14:54,895
He laughs about it.

2638
02:14:54,928 --> 02:14:57,865
And you couldn't leave
a tip, right?

2639
02:14:57,898 --> 02:14:59,933
At the end, I couldn't.

2640
02:15:00,635 --> 02:15:01,969
The party was fabulous.

2641
02:15:02,002 --> 02:15:03,937
The reception was fabulous.

2642
02:15:03,971 --> 02:15:06,173
The welcome to California
was exciting,

2643
02:15:06,206 --> 02:15:09,511
and from there,
everything went downhill.

2644
02:15:09,544 --> 02:15:10,545
About eight months later,

2645
02:15:10,578 --> 02:15:15,283
I realized that um,
it wasn't going to happen.

2646
02:15:15,317 --> 02:15:16,518
I had just finished

2647
02:15:16,551 --> 02:15:19,454
probably the most expensive
album ever done

2648
02:15:19,487 --> 02:15:21,222
in the record industry,
which was

2649
02:15:21,256 --> 02:15:24,225
<i>Here's Johnny: Magic Moments</i>
<i>From</i> The Tonight Show,

2650
02:15:24,259 --> 02:15:26,093
- and we opened...
- Oh, <i>you</i> did that.

2651
02:15:26,126 --> 02:15:28,996
Yeah. That was our record.

2652
02:15:29,029 --> 02:15:30,465
You all bought that,
didn't you?

2653
02:15:30,498 --> 02:15:32,099
Yeah.

2654
02:15:32,132 --> 02:15:34,935
We over-advertised,
and we over-promoted.

2655
02:15:34,968 --> 02:15:38,540
And we did everything
you could possibly do wrong.

2656
02:15:38,573 --> 02:15:40,608
And I went to Acapulco,

2657
02:15:40,642 --> 02:15:42,610
and while I was there,
scuba diving,

2658
02:15:42,644 --> 02:15:46,481
I thought that, "You owe
three million dollars.

2659
02:15:46,514 --> 02:15:48,216
You don't have any money
left in the bank."

2660
02:15:48,249 --> 02:15:50,050
- Yeah.
- "You might have payroll

2661
02:15:50,084 --> 02:15:52,953
for about two
or three weeks left."

2662
02:15:52,986 --> 02:15:55,956
And I was down there,
and I took the mouthpiece out

2663
02:15:55,989 --> 02:15:57,958
and said, "It could be over."

2664
02:15:57,991 --> 02:16:00,160
I mean, that could be it.
You don't have to come back

2665
02:16:00,194 --> 02:16:02,230
to the problems.
You don't have to come back

2666
02:16:02,263 --> 02:16:04,299
to face the failure.

2667
02:16:04,332 --> 02:16:07,968
And, um... the last record
I released at Buddah Records

2668
02:16:08,001 --> 02:16:10,338
was a thing
by Gladys Knight and the Pips,

2669
02:16:10,372 --> 02:16:12,172
that when LA seemed
too much for the man,

2670
02:16:12,206 --> 02:16:13,675
he couldn't make it,
so he's leaving

2671
02:16:13,708 --> 02:16:14,642
the life he's come to know.

2672
02:16:14,676 --> 02:16:17,111
He's leaving on a midnight
train to Georgia.

2673
02:16:17,144 --> 02:16:19,681
And I just realized
that wasn't me.

2674
02:16:19,714 --> 02:16:23,251
I had to win, or I had to fail.

2675
02:16:23,284 --> 02:16:24,519
I couldn't cop out,

2676
02:16:24,552 --> 02:16:26,987
and I put
the mouthpiece back in.

2677
02:16:27,020 --> 02:16:29,657
I swam and found Joyce.

2678
02:16:29,691 --> 02:16:32,126
I said, "Come on back.
We're going upstairs.

2679
02:16:32,159 --> 02:16:33,994
We're gonna go back,
and we're gonna do it.

2680
02:16:34,027 --> 02:16:35,663
We're going to win,
or we're gonna fail."

2681
02:16:35,697 --> 02:16:37,699
And in the back of my head,
I always had the thought

2682
02:16:37,732 --> 02:16:40,000
that I can always go
back to Brooklyn and open

2683
02:16:40,033 --> 02:16:41,135
- a candy store.
- Yeah,

2684
02:16:41,168 --> 02:16:43,605
except there are a lot of those
there, aren't there?

2685
02:16:43,638 --> 02:16:46,106
Yeah, but you know,
growing up there, I mean,

2686
02:16:46,140 --> 02:16:48,942
that was always
a kind of comforting thing

2687
02:16:48,976 --> 02:16:50,512
that I could always go
back to that,

2688
02:16:50,545 --> 02:16:52,146
and that was a great life.

2689
02:16:55,383 --> 02:16:56,418
Hi.

2690
02:16:56,451 --> 02:16:58,185
What does a tiger say?

2691
02:17:00,154 --> 02:17:03,558
That was the Bogarts,
the fabulous Bogarts!

2692
02:17:03,591 --> 02:17:05,192
Well, I want to thank you all.

2693
02:17:05,226 --> 02:17:09,364
Jill, Timothy, Bradley,
come on. Come on.

2694
02:17:09,397 --> 02:17:11,299
Say goodbye to the audience.

2695
02:17:11,332 --> 02:17:12,534
We'll see you again!

2696
02:17:12,567 --> 02:17:14,602
-Bye!
-Bye, everybody!

2697
02:17:14,636 --> 02:17:16,237
- Bye!
- Bye!

2698
02:17:16,271 --> 02:17:19,006
Do you have one more word you'd
like to say to everybody?

2699
02:17:19,039 --> 02:17:21,709
Goodbye. Cheerio.

2700
02:17:21,743 --> 02:17:23,043
What was that?

2701
02:17:24,579 --> 02:17:27,515
...from the fabulous Bogarts!

2702
02:17:27,549 --> 02:17:28,982
See you next week!

2703
02:17:29,016 --> 02:17:30,150
Yeah!
