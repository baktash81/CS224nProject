gonna stay in there.

I remember Matty got out,

41
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:18,531
and a few minutes later,
I heard him ask where was Alice.

42
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:26,774
So, I stood up and looked
out across the dam,

43
00:03:26,775 --> 00:03:30,543

I could see Alice's towel,
she'd left it on the ground,

49

and she clearly hadn't
got out of the water

50
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:01,892

have picked up her towel, so...

We got a call from Russell on

an accident at the weir,

So, we thought that
we better go to Ararat.

funny about seeing Iris,

71

She'd said that Alice is missing

00:06:58,369 --> 00:07:01,204

85
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,574

June stayed in the car.

113
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,281
And, you know, on reflection,
I think that was a mistake

114
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:11,184

have any closure.

<i>RUSSELL: The car stalled on the
way back from the dam.</i>

122
00:10:02,353 --> 00:10:05,589
<i>But the only gear I could

123
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:09,392
<i>So, we drove back</i>
<i>into town in reverse.</i>

124
00:10:10,227 --> 00:10:12,095
<i>Which was either that or walk.</i>

125

00:13:34,415 --> 00:13:39,318
<i>There was one particular one, it
was quite vivid and recurring.</i>

165
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:44,190
<i>Alice would come down the hall
still dripping from the dam</i>

166
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:49,763
<i>and just stand at the foot of
our bed, just staring at us.</i>

167
00:13:49,764 --> 00:13:55,434
<i>It was quite terrifying, as I said,
I didn't want to open my eyes.</i>

168
00:13:59,107 --> 00:14:02,642
<i>By early February my
nightmares were getting so bad</i>

169
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:06,279
<i>that I began to go</i>
<i>for walks at night,</i>

170
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,531
<i>sometimes for hours at a time,</i>

171
00:14:08,532 --> 00:14:11,218
<i>just so that I didn't have
to go to bed at night</i>

172
00:14:11,219 --> 00:14:13,970
<i>and close my eyes and go to sleep.</i>

173
00:14:17,225 --> 00:14:21,194
<i>Sometimes I would actually</i>
<i>go into people's houses.</i>

174
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:25,198
<i>I didn't feel like I was
doing anything wrong.</i>

175
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,469
I guess I really just wanted to be
inside someone else's life for a while.

176
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:44,667
INTERVIEWER: Georgie, do you remember
how Russell was doing at that time?

177
00:14:44,668 --> 00:14:49,439
Yeah, Russell was...
He was working a lot at that point.

178
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,309
<i>I think that might have
helped him with his grief.</i>

179
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,745
Send it through
without any explanation.

180
00:14:55,746 --> 00:14:57,263
<i>FREDERIK: Russell and I met</i>

181
00:14:57,264 --> 00:15:00,099
<i>actually on the Gippsland</i>
<i>Catchment project in '98</i>

182
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,335
<i>and worked together on that.</i>

183
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:04,037
INTERVIEWER: So, you guys have known
each other for a few years?

184
00:15:04,038 --> 00:15:06,772
Yeah, a good few years, yeah.

185
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:10,727
<i>Do you remember how he was
affected after Alice's death?</i>

186
00:15:10,728 --> 00:15:12,828
<i>What changed?</i>

187
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:17,317
<i>It was work as normal, and
that was troubling actually.</i>

188
00:15:17,318 --> 00:15:20,987
<i>I didn't really know what
to say to him about that.</i>

189
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,523
You never spoke about it?

190
00:15:23,524 --> 00:15:26,509
Not really.
Everyone grieves in their own way.

191
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:32,349
And it wasn't really my place
to be telling him how to feel.

192
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,385
But I certainly...
I certainly was concerned.

193
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:41,073
<i>RUSSELL: I was really grateful
that I had my work.</i>

194
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:43,994
And, I mean, I felt really
guilty about that at the time.

195
00:15:43,995 --> 00:15:47,463
But, you know, I just
wanted to get on with it.

196
00:15:51,568 --> 00:15:55,455
<i>Then one night, in late February,</i>

197
00:15:55,456 --> 00:15:59,459
<i>I came home from work, and I
was sitting in the kitchen</i>

198
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,611
<i>and I heard a noise</i>
<i>coming from Ali's room.</i>

199
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:08,401
<i>So, I went into Ali's room,</i>
<i>and I don't really know why,</i>

200
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:11,921
but I sort of found
myself sitting down

201
00:16:11,922 --> 00:16:13,822
in the chair in front
of the dresser.

202
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,327
And before I could kind of work
out what I was doing there,

203
00:16:18,328 --> 00:16:21,865
Ali walked in and she
went over to her desk

204
00:16:21,866 --> 00:16:23,767
and started sharpening a pencil,

205
00:16:23,768 --> 00:16:31,074
and then she looked like she was checking
for a text message on her phone.

206
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:34,377
And, you know, I was
completely freaked out.

207
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:39,148
She was completely
oblivious to my presence.

208
00:16:40,718 --> 00:16:44,453
And then I don't know what happened,
I must have moved the bed

209
00:16:44,454 --> 00:16:46,890
or, you know, squeaked
my shoes or something,

210
00:16:46,891 --> 00:16:49,492
but she went completely rigid.

211
00:16:50,327 --> 00:16:55,865
And I knew then that
she knew I was there.

212
00:16:55,866 --> 00:17:01,470
And she slowly turned around and she
looked me right in the eye fully for,

213
00:17:01,471 --> 00:17:04,640
you know, what felt like forever.

214
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:10,379
And then she just came at me and stood
up and said, "Get out! Get out!"

215
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,817
And I just got up and went
out as fast as I could.

216
00:17:16,187 --> 00:17:17,853
I could hear Russell crying.

217
00:17:17,854 --> 00:17:19,322
And he was here in the kitchen,

218
00:17:19,323 --> 00:17:21,357
Mathew and I both
found him in here,

219
00:17:21,358 --> 00:17:23,592
and he was sobbing.

220
00:17:23,593 --> 00:17:26,495
He was absolutely inconsolable.

221
00:17:26,496 --> 00:17:29,782
INTERVIEWER: Do you believe Russell
when he says he saw a ghost?

222
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:33,619
Yeah, I do.
I believe he saw what he saw.

223
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:38,991
And he wouldn't... He's not the
kind of man to make something up.

224
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:42,762
So, I believe he saw something.

225
00:17:42,763 --> 00:17:47,433
Whether it's a real ghost
or not, I don't really know.

226
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:49,635
But I'm sure he saw something.

227
00:18:07,304 --> 00:18:11,407
<i>GEORGIE: I remember trying to
talk to members of the church</i>

228
00:18:11,408 --> 00:18:15,795
<i>about how to help June</i>
<i>and how to help the Palmers.</i>

229
00:18:15,796 --> 00:18:20,800
<i>But there just didn't seem like
there was anything we could do.</i>

230
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:23,302
<i>I think part of the reason was</i>

231
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:24,804
<i>because they weren't churchgoers.</i>

232
00:18:24,805 --> 00:18:28,223
<i>So, didn't know how to
offer them comfort.</i>

233
00:18:30,994 --> 00:18:35,015
<i>I don't even know</i>
<i>what June believes in.</i>

234
00:18:35,016 --> 00:18:38,417
I found myself mostly
concerned about Mathew.

235
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,772
I guess because those two
were always so close,

236
00:18:42,773 --> 00:18:45,507
<i>I was worried how he would cope.</i>

237
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:56,819
<i>I remember he was spending</i>
<i>a lot more time alone.</i>

238
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:00,989
<i>We were all worried about him.</i>

239
00:19:04,295 --> 00:19:08,731
Mathew came in with some
unusual bruises on his body.

240
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:13,870
They were unusual in terms of
their distribution and depth.

241
00:19:13,871 --> 00:19:17,774
We obviously took a history,
trying to exclude trauma,

242
00:19:17,775 --> 00:19:22,012
<i>but there was certainly no history of
trauma that he was able to give us.</i>

243
00:19:22,013 --> 00:19:23,946
<i>We tested him for vasculitis,</i>

244
00:19:23,947 --> 00:19:28,751
<i>and we also excluded any poisoning
or toxins in his system.</i>

245
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:31,454
<i>We were unable to turn
up anything conclusive.</i>

246
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:37,794
And several weeks after this, the
bruises just resolved spontaneously.

247
00:19:37,795 --> 00:19:41,881
<i>And we were never able to really
establish a cause for them.</i>

248
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:48,137
<i>My name's Steve Wilkie.</i>
<i>I'm Mathew's best friend.</i>

249
00:19:48,138 --> 00:19:52,157
I usually stay at Mathew's house
two or three times a week.

250
00:19:54,895 --> 00:20:02,084
We started a band together, so, we
normally play music at my house.

251
00:20:02,085 --> 00:20:06,506
<i>Mathew seems a bit quieter, but
he was always pretty quiet,</i>

252
00:20:06,507 --> 00:20:11,677
<i>so, I guess there wasn't really any
warning bells going off or anything.</i>

253
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:15,081
<i>Well, I had heard about June
going into people's houses.</i>

254
00:20:15,082 --> 00:20:17,884
And Mathew never really seemed to
want to talk about any of that.

255
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:20,719
I never asked him about any of it.

256
00:20:26,026 --> 00:20:29,011
<i>LEITH: I know that he was always
interested in photography.</i>

257
00:20:29,012 --> 00:20:30,896
<i>And he was...</i>

258
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:35,451
At this time, he was starting
to pursue it with more passion.

259
00:20:38,973 --> 00:20:42,375
<i>CLIVE: Mathew came to me,
he was very keen</i>

260
00:20:42,376 --> 00:20:44,110
<i>to find out anything</i>
<i>about photography.</i>

261
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:47,680
<i>So, I was more than willing to
help out, that's what I do.</i>

262
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:51,417
<i>So, he was picking my brains about
just about anything to do with it,</i>

263
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:55,704
from equipment, down to techniques,
down to lighting, you know.

264
00:20:55,705 --> 00:20:59,892
<i>But he was a great asset, so,
I mean, eventually I employed him.</i>

265
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:27,987
INTERVIEWER: Mathew, can you talk to
me about the photographs

266
00:21:27,988 --> 00:21:31,223
of the backyard that
you've been taking?

267
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:36,462
Yeah, basically I've
taken that same photo

268
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:41,100
with that composition for, I think, every
three months for the past four years.

269
00:21:41,101 --> 00:21:43,803
And it's just a photograph
of the backyard.

270
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:46,656
<i>Looking out, you can see</i>
<i>the hills in the distance.</i>

271
00:21:46,657 --> 00:21:48,991
<i>It's just like a little project</i>

272
00:21:48,992 --> 00:21:52,061
<i>that I set up for myself</i>
<i>when we got here.</i>

273
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:57,116
INTERVIEWER: And what was in the April
28th photograph that was different?

274
00:21:57,117 --> 00:22:02,321
Well, it's basically the same shot,

275
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:08,677
<i>but it would appear that Alice
is standing against the fence.</i>

276
00:22:16,687 --> 00:22:20,556
<i>Do you remember what the reaction
in the house was at the time?</i>

277
00:22:20,557 --> 00:22:26,062
I wouldn't say the mood was good,
but it was better than before.

278
00:22:26,063 --> 00:22:31,667
It was like... Like it gave us sort
of something to focus on, I think.

279
00:22:31,668 --> 00:22:33,335
All of us.

280
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:39,292
<i>BOB: The photographs were</i>
<i>taken on the 3rd of April,</i>

281
00:22:39,293 --> 00:22:45,614
and they were developed on the 4th, and
I looked at them, I think on the 5th.

282
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:50,052
And looked at the dams and the water
levels and I was quite happy.

283
00:22:50,053 --> 00:22:53,939
But it was only the following night that
it was pointed out to me by my wife

284
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,374
<i>that there was something
in the background</i>

285
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:58,143
<i>in Norval Dam, this image came up.</i>

286
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:13,959
<i>JUNE: When I first looked
at the photograph,</i>

287
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,178
I didn't know what to make of it.

288
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:18,831
The image was quite unsettling

289
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:22,417
because it certainly
looked like Alice.

290
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:27,155
<i>It was an incredibly</i>
<i>discomforting image.</i>

291
00:23:31,728 --> 00:23:35,263
And I became convinced
that Alice was still alive.

292
00:23:42,239 --> 00:23:47,108
<i>RUSSELL: I didn't have any rational
explanation for who was in those photos.</i>

293
00:23:48,112 --> 00:23:52,515
But I did know something
about Alice that June didn't.

294
00:23:52,516 --> 00:23:57,720
I'd seen Alice's body.
I didn't think she was alive.

295
00:23:59,123 --> 00:24:01,740
I knew she wasn't.

296
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:06,061
I became convinced that
Russell had made a mistake.

297
00:24:06,062 --> 00:24:10,031
<i>He himself said that it didn't
look like anybody anymore.</i>

298
00:24:12,402 --> 00:24:14,286
June was so convinced
that I'd made a mistake

299
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:17,222
that I actually started
to have doubts myself.

300
00:24:17,223 --> 00:24:21,894
I started to think maybe
I'd made my mind up

301
00:24:21,895 --> 00:24:25,631
that it was Alice's
body before I'd looked,

302
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:29,852
and that the circumstances
were so compelling for me,

303
00:24:29,853 --> 00:24:33,905
that I'd decided that it was her.

304
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:40,679
More than three months after the funeral
of Ararat teenager Alice Palmer,

305
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,048
her grieving parents
formally requested

306
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:45,651
her body be exhumed
from the general cemetery.

307
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:48,454
<i>There has been some contention</i>
<i>from the Palmer family</i>

308
00:24:48,455 --> 00:24:51,991
<i>about the accuracy of the
original body identification.</i>

309
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:56,762
June and Russell Palmer were adamant
that DNA testing be carried out.

310
00:24:56,763 --> 00:24:59,015
They just couldn't be sure
that the body they identified

311
00:24:59,016 --> 00:25:00,249
was indeed Alice.

312
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,550
<i>TRUDEAU: And today, almost...</i>

313
00:25:01,551 --> 00:25:03,119
<i>RUSSELL: Alice's body was exhumed</i>

314
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,189
<i>in the presence of the funeral
director, Dr. Slatter,</i>

315
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:09,576
<i>and there was a representative
from the coroner's office also.</i>

316
00:25:09,577 --> 00:25:12,378
<i>And it was then transported</i>
<i>to Ararat Base Hospital</i>

317
00:25:12,379 --> 00:25:14,914
where they took the DNA samples.

318
00:25:14,915 --> 00:25:18,483
And she stayed there until
the results came back.

319
00:25:22,122 --> 00:25:24,824
<i>JUNE:
A few days later we received a copy</i>

320
00:25:24,825 --> 00:25:28,627
<i>of the coroner's</i>
<i>preliminary report,</i>

321
00:25:28,628 --> 00:25:34,966
<i>and Alice's identity was confirmed
by the DNA sample match.</i>

322
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:40,774
<i>RUSSELL: It was only after they'd

which I guess probably fits
about a third of my clients,

00:29:54,194 --> 00:29:56,028
is to allow them the possibility

that death is not the bitter end,

I don't think Dad was
thrilled about the idea.

461
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:57,990
But, yeah, I thought
it would be interesting.

462
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:00,559
And I suggested we film it,

463
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,745

472
00:36:32,425 --> 00:36:37,429
that Mathew was
reviewing the footage

473
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:40,865

different to the hallway footage.</i>

00:37:08,778 --> 00:37:14,316
<i>For one, it was significantly more
detailed, so it was less ambiguous.</i>

477
00:37:14,317 --> 00:37:17,169

play and digital noise.

out what it was.

It was a couple of months
later, the end of July,

522
00:40:55,621 --> 00:41:02,511
when we were looking at our footage
that we'd shot down at the dam

523
00:41:02,512 --> 00:41:05,296
<i>and came across...</i>

524

"when he captured the image that
people have been talking about."

529
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:24,265
So, then we went
through all our footage

530
00:41:24,266 --> 00:41:27,318
<i>to see if we perhaps might have
captured that figure as well.</i>

531
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:29,087

<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

533
00:41:31,657 --> 00:41:35,026
And we did find a figure
in the background

534
00:41:35,027 --> 00:41:39,013
like the image that had been
described in his picture.

535
00:41:39,014 --> 00:41:40,882
And then we looked more closely

536
00:41:40,883 --> 00:41:43,551

545
00:42:11,831 --> 00:42:15,417
MATTHEW: Well, this is where I was
when the Bob Smeet photo was taken.

546
00:42:15,418 --> 00:42:20,572
I was wearing Alice's jacket, and I
looked up and I saw a man on the hill,

547
00:42:20,573 --> 00:42:22,874
who turned out to be Bob Smeet.

548
00:42:22,875 --> 00:42:26,777
And I didn't wanna be in a photo.

549
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,366
So, I walked off through the bush.

550
00:42:31,367 --> 00:42:35,803
What I didn't see was there was
also a couple over there filming,

551
00:42:35,804 --> 00:42:37,839
who turned out to be the Withers.

552
00:42:41,827 --> 00:42:44,896
<i>When the Withers' thing</i>
<i>came out, Dad came to me</i>

553
00:42:44,897 --> 00:42:48,332
<i>and asked me if I had been
involved in anything else.</i>

554
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:52,319
<i>And I didn't wanna lie</i>
<i>to him, so I told him.</i>

555
00:43:00,429 --> 00:43:02,764
<i>And I explained to Dad</i>
<i>that I was responsible</i>

556
00:43:02,765 --> 00:43:04,932
<i>for the image of Alice</i>
<i>in the hallway</i>

557
00:43:04,933 --> 00:43:10,438
<i>and the bedroom, and that I created
the April 28th backyard photo</i>

558
00:43:10,439 --> 00:43:12,890
<i>and the seance image.</i>

559
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:14,892
<i>I just told him what I'd done.</i>

560
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:16,344
Okay, so...

561
00:43:16,345 --> 00:43:20,164
<i>I got two photos, a photo
of Alice and the backyard</i>

562
00:43:20,165 --> 00:43:23,251
<i>and composited the images.</i>

563
00:43:23,252 --> 00:43:25,453
That's a photo
that I took of Alice.

564
00:43:25,454 --> 00:43:27,805
<i>Mum kept talking about...</i>

565
00:43:27,806 --> 00:43:29,924
<i>She was always talking</i>
<i>about getting Alice exhumed,</i>

566
00:43:29,925 --> 00:43:32,710
<i>and she was really</i>
<i>keen on this idea</i>

567
00:43:32,711 --> 00:43:34,679
<i>that Dad had
misidentified her body.</i>

568
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,949
And so I knew that without more
evidence it wasn't going to happen,

569
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:41,119
so I made the photograph.

570
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,842
<i>I just used an old video of Alice</i>

571
00:43:49,194 --> 00:43:53,047
<i>and I played that on the TV.</i>

572
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:54,982
<i>I had the TV up on the book case</i>

573
00:43:54,983 --> 00:43:57,786
<i>and it was as simple</i>
<i>as rotating the mirror</i>

574
00:43:57,787 --> 00:44:01,473
<i>so that the reflection</i>
<i>of the TV came up in it.</i>

575
00:44:01,474 --> 00:44:04,075
<i>And obviously the
mirror's quite small,</i>

576
00:44:04,076 --> 00:44:05,910
<i>so it cropped out the
edges of the television</i>

577
00:44:05,911 --> 00:44:08,513
<i>and then, yeah, I just filmed that.</i>

578
00:44:08,514 --> 00:44:10,631
<i>Same with the kitchen</i>
<i>and the bedroom.</i>

579
00:44:10,632 --> 00:44:15,503
<i>What you see basically is Alice
on the television in the mirror.</i>

580
00:44:24,846 --> 00:44:29,283
<i>Like, it wasn't about</i>
<i>trying to trick people.</i>

581
00:44:29,284 --> 00:44:32,604
I guess it was like something
was better than nothing.

00:44:32,605 --> 00:44:37,008
INTERVIEWER: Do you think that what you
did ultimately made it worse for June?

583
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:45,282
I think that...

584
00:44:46,418 --> 00:44:50,755
Yeah. Yeah, I probably did
make it harder for her.

585
00:44:50,756 --> 00:44:53,891
But, I mean, that
wasn't my intention.

586
00:44:56,478 --> 00:45:01,833
I'm not quite so sure
about his reasons.

587
00:45:02,401 --> 00:45:04,969
I don't know that I

588
00:45:06,221 --> 00:45:08,005
totally...

589
00:45:11,577 --> 00:45:14,980
I don't want to say I don't
totally believe what he said,

590
00:45:14,981 --> 00:45:19,567
but I'm just not convinced

591
00:45:19,568 --> 00:45:22,469
that he really knows why he did it.

592
00:45:28,827 --> 00:45:31,763
When it all came out, people
wanted to do stories and books

593
00:45:31,764 --> 00:45:36,017

lot just went pear-shaped.

<i>know how to handle it.</i>

<i>I mean, you know, we had to protect
Matty, we had to protect ourselves,</i>

596
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:47,295
<i>we had to protect Ali's memory.</i>

597
00:45:47,296 --> 00:45:50,131
<i>And we just didn't</i>
<i>have any experience</i>

598
00:45:50,132 --> 00:45:52,250
<i>of dealing with all this interest</i>

599
00:45:52,251 --> 00:45:54,435
<i>in something that</i>
<i>was incredibly personal</i>

600
00:45:54,436 --> 00:45:58,272
<i>that people wanted</i>
<i>to make incredibly public.</i>

601
00:45:58,273 --> 00:46:01,993
I mean, the Palmers weren't
coping well at all at that point.

<i>She just really wasn't
