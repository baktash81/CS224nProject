1
00:02:10,903 --> 00:02:12,302
You got a problem ?

2
00:02:12,404 --> 00:02:14,304
Me, no i aint got no problem

00:02:14,406 --> 00:02:16,465
Come on, take a good look, do i look like i

00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:22,312
Yeah, well you better get your eyes checked, cause i aint
got no problems okay.

6
00:02:22,414 --> 00:02:25,383
As a matter of fact, around here i am the one
that makes the problems.

7
00:02:25,918 --> 00:02:29,319
- Oh, i am scared!
- I am just standing here checking you babes out.

8
00:02:29,421 --> 00:02:33,380
Why dont you go to the supermarket and check yourself out
first, huh?

9
00:02:34,426 --> 00:02:36,826
ooh, you are a tough little cookie,
i like that.

10
00:02:36,929 --> 00:02:40,490
You know what, one smack should straight you right up;
how about that?

11
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:43,397
oh yeah, and who is gonna do the smacking?
You and what militia?

12
00:02:43,602 --> 00:02:46,503
- Listen, you stuck up little bitch
- No, you listen dickface

13
00:02:46,605 --> 00:02:49,836
My boyfriend is gonna be here any second and if you're still 
here when he comes, you're gonna run 

14
00:02:49,942 --> 00:02:53,343
as fast as you can, and only then it will be too late

15
00:02:53,445 --> 00:02:56,278
- You're such a tiger! I love it.
- Fuck you and your pink shirt.

16
00:02:56,382 --> 00:02:59,681
- Hey, Asshole.
- Carol, what are you doing here?

17
00:02:59,785 --> 00:03:03,277
- I tought you were going to the tanning.
- I was...I just...I am

18
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:05,289
were you...are you...just

19
00:03:05,391 --> 00:03:07,450
giving these tourists directions.

20
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,291
- Come on, baby you know i love you.
- Directiones to tourists my ass.

21
00:03:11,397 --> 00:03:13,228
Those girls don't mean anything to me.

22
00:03:13,332 --> 00:03:15,300
Damn weasel.

23
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:18,302
- Men, Am i right or wrong?
- They serve their purpose.

24
00:03:18,404 --> 00:03:21,305
I am not complaining, i got the greatest boyfriend in the whole
world.

25
00:03:21,407 --> 00:03:25,309
But the way i look at it, most guys are more like that jurk
than they are like my boyfriend.

26
00:03:25,411 --> 00:03:27,811
By the way,
my name Lou, Short for louise.

27
00:03:27,913 --> 00:03:31,314
My father wanted boys, so he made everyone
call me Lou and the name just kind of stuck .

28
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:33,146
- what's yours?
- Carla.

29
00:03:33,252 --> 00:03:34,719
- are you kidding
- No.

30
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,321
My best friend in the third grade was nammed Carla,
Carla Naxenhoff.

31
00:03:38,424 --> 00:03:40,324
- what's your last name?
- Bennett.

32
00:03:40,426 --> 00:03:43,327
- Bennett, great name, Bennett.
- It's english.

33
00:03:43,429 --> 00:03:45,397
I've been to London before, twice actually.

34
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,329
once to dance and once with my boyfriend, just for two days
he was giving a concert.

35
00:03:49,435 --> 00:03:53,269
That's actually why i am here, my boyfriend lives in this building.
Do you got a boyfriend?

36
00:03:53,372 --> 00:03:54,771
- Sort of.
- what does he do?

37
00:03:54,873 --> 00:03:57,239
- He's an actor.
- Get out like mine.

38
00:03:57,343 --> 00:04:00,437
I tought that yours is a musician, you said he did a concert in london?

39
00:04:00,546 --> 00:04:03,447
Not that kind of concerts,
More like mixed media.

40
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:06,677
he sings, he dances, he acts, he does stand ups...

41
00:04:07,386 --> 00:04:10,116
...he is a real entertainer.
like Liza Minelli.

42
00:04:10,222 --> 00:04:12,281
- So what do you do?
- Design.

43
00:04:12,391 --> 00:04:15,792
- female Calvin Klein, huh?
- well we're in the same field...but im not

44
00:04:15,894 --> 00:04:19,352
You're not nearly as famous, i know,
I am gonna be famous one day, i just know it

45
00:04:19,565 --> 00:04:23,296
My boyfriend promised me, as soon as he makes it.

46
00:04:23,402 --> 00:04:25,097
he's gonna cast me as his co-star because we're so good together

47
00:04:25,204 --> 00:04:28,799
But you never know, i may make it first, and then i'll have to cast him as my co-star

48
00:04:28,907 --> 00:04:30,704
...If i'm in the mood .
Just kidding.

49
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,311
He is actually really talented, and i am not just saying that.

50
00:04:34,413 --> 00:04:35,903
He has a way with words.

51
00:04:36,015 --> 00:04:37,983
He can talk you into buying a house without a roof .

52
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,810
- Sounds irresistable.
- That's what he is. he is irresistable

53
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:42,614
People cannot resist him.

54
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:44,313
You know, I bet you've seen him on TV.

55
00:04:44,423 --> 00:04:47,324
He's had guest spots on "N.Y.P.D. Blue"
in "Homicide"...

56
00:04:47,426 --> 00:04:50,554
...and he did the  Gary Shandling show twice. 
he was totally hilarious.

57
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:53,830
and he wrote personnaly to 
Barry Levinson and Don Simpson.

58
00:04:53,932 --> 00:04:55,559
And Simpson was gonna give him a lead...

59
00:04:55,668 --> 00:04:58,831
in this romantic comedy that his production company was gonna do.

60
00:04:59,305 --> 00:05:01,000
But then he died

61
00:05:04,376 --> 00:05:05,343
are you okay?

62
00:05:15,387 --> 00:05:16,513
Blake Allan.

63
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,358
Yeah, that is his name.

64
00:05:21,393 --> 00:05:22,360
Who are you?

65
00:05:24,396 --> 00:05:25,522
His girlfriend.

66
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,527
I am his girlfriend.

67
00:05:29,401 --> 00:05:30,868
I am his girlfriend.

68
00:05:42,348 --> 00:05:44,213
American Airlines, flight 11.

69
00:05:47,753 --> 00:05:48,720
Right.

70
00:05:51,423 --> 00:05:55,484
So you mean you came here to surprise him too?

71
00:06:02,368 --> 00:06:03,335
Oh my god!

72
00:06:11,377 --> 00:06:13,436
looks like he's giving us alot bigger surprise

73
00:06:13,545 --> 00:06:16,173
then either one of us was planning on giving him.

74
00:06:20,386 --> 00:06:21,512
Just one minute.

75
00:07:42,401 --> 00:07:44,301
I'll buzz you in.

76
00:09:09,521 --> 00:09:10,647
welcome home.

77
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:22,261
you dont know me, no wonder it's his favourite song.

78
00:09:22,367 --> 00:09:23,766
it should be his anthem.

79
00:09:23,869 --> 00:09:25,336
Notice anything different?

80
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:29,268
That's where my picture used to be.

81
00:09:29,374 --> 00:09:31,103
It still is.

82
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:34,345
- It is ?
- when you're here.

83
00:09:34,546 --> 00:09:37,447
Did he ever tell you that's the first time he put anyones picture 

84
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:39,278
on his piano besides his mother?

85
00:09:39,384 --> 00:09:42,785
Yes, because he said it made him feel like i was physically with him.

86
00:09:42,888 --> 00:09:45,356
In front of him and inside of him at the same time.

87
00:09:45,891 --> 00:09:49,292
maybe we should wreck his whole fucking apartement right now.

88
00:09:49,394 --> 00:09:51,021
I'd rather wreck him.

89
00:09:51,396 --> 00:09:55,355
yeah that's a really good idea but how, should we stab him ?

90
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:56,864
Too quick.

91
00:09:57,569 --> 00:09:58,536
Asshole	.

92
00:09:59,338 --> 00:10:00,236
Creep.

93
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:01,363
Scumbag.

94
00:10:01,573 --> 00:10:02,870
Did you really love him?

95
00:10:03,408 --> 00:10:04,705
Yeah i did.

96
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,377
did you?

97
00:10:06,578 --> 00:10:08,307
I told him i did, and i tought i meant it.

98
00:10:08,413 --> 00:10:10,313
who knows? I felt something.

99
00:10:10,415 --> 00:10:12,349
- Emotional?
- More.

100
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:13,349
More?

101
00:10:13,452 --> 00:10:15,943
More than i felt for anyone else, different.

102
00:10:16,054 --> 00:10:18,318
- which is what he said...
- that You were different?

103
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,821
He never experienced real love before he met me.
before me love was

104
00:10:21,927 --> 00:10:23,485
Just another four letter word.

105
00:10:23,595 --> 00:10:26,223
Begining with L, no more significant than like or lust.

106
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,262
Then he would shake his head like this.

107
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:31,234
shows how helpless he was about his work with his overwhelming passion.

108
00:10:31,436 --> 00:10:35,338
- and when he'll go inside of you it's like...
- Returning home to his sanity, his refuge.

109
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,170
- Perfect rythm.
- Perfect rythm and harmony.

110
00:10:38,276 --> 00:10:40,836
Atomic union or something...

111
00:10:40,946 --> 00:10:45,280
The union of atomic matter, the matter returning to its pure state after temporary seperation of time and space

112
00:10:45,384 --> 00:10:46,681
how do you remember all that?

113
00:10:46,785 --> 00:10:49,845
easily. he said it about a 100 times as if it were a mantra.

114
00:10:49,955 --> 00:10:51,513
Did he ever asked you to marry him?

115
00:10:51,623 --> 00:10:53,614
- No,why he asked you?
- No.

116
00:10:54,393 --> 00:10:56,793
- why you ask?
- just curious.

117
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,295
Just trying to understand his twisted mind.

118
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:01,729
I think his thing for me was more sexual.

119
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:05,302
Altough he did say he felt romantic towards me.

120
00:11:05,404 --> 00:11:06,871
he told you he loved you?

121
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:10,299
yeah, he said:
"I love you and you love me"...

122
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:14,243
because he couldnt stand it if he said i love you, and didnt say it back.

123
00:11:14,346 --> 00:11:16,871
it is crazy. even now i shouldnt care 

124
00:11:16,982 --> 00:11:21,214
what he said or did...
- it still hurts i know, it hurts me too.

125
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,253
i feel like this is somehow a dream that i am gonna wake up from .

126
00:11:24,356 --> 00:11:25,323
So do I.

127
00:11:25,424 --> 00:11:28,154
- how long did you know him?
- ten months, how about you?

128
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,421
- February 15.
- I dont remember the date

129
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:33,896
but it was definitely snowing. So it must have been february

130
00:11:34,433 --> 00:11:38,335
and everything started off real slow. And then he got really intense all of a sudden

131
00:11:38,437 --> 00:11:40,337
- and he told me...
- he was yours and you were his...

132
00:11:40,439 --> 00:11:43,567
and neither one of you is ever gonna be with anyone else ever again.
That was in march.

133
00:11:44,943 --> 00:11:47,741
yeah, march right
because he said it to me

134
00:11:47,846 --> 00:11:51,179
at  halftime at the NCAA semi-finals.

135
00:11:51,283 --> 00:11:53,274
Unfucking believable.
he knew it from the begining.

136
00:11:53,385 --> 00:11:56,218
- knew what, knew what he wanted?
- he knew what he was up to.

137
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:58,516
it is not like he knew one of us for years or even months

138
00:11:58,623 --> 00:12:01,524
and then the other one came in his life and made it complicated

139
00:12:01,893 --> 00:12:05,124
he decided conscienly to take a shot with 2 girls at the same time.

140
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,357
he wanted a girlfriend.he wanted to fill the void.

141
00:12:07,566 --> 00:12:10,535
and so he figured if one of us didnt work out then the other might.

142
00:12:10,736 --> 00:12:13,796
what he didnt count on was that the both of us would work out.

143
00:12:13,905 --> 00:12:15,304
- but we did.
- until now.

144
00:12:15,407 --> 00:12:16,965
it is gonna be neither.

145
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:22,243
But you dont think he was looking to have two permanantly

146
00:12:22,347 --> 00:12:24,872
Like those what do you call it?
- Bigamos?

147
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,875
- No, those ones in Utah.
- Mormons?

148
00:12:28,253 --> 00:12:29,379
Yes: mormones.

149
00:12:29,755 --> 00:12:31,313
Do you think he is a mormon?

150
00:12:31,423 --> 00:12:34,324
- He is no mormon.
- He sure is a cocksucker.

151
00:12:34,426 --> 00:12:36,394
No, i think that was our function.

152
00:12:36,595 --> 00:12:38,324
Oh you did that with him?

153
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,227
- What?
- give him Head?

154
00:12:40,432 --> 00:12:42,229
why does that shock you?

155
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:45,335
No, it is just that...
do you know what he used to tell me?

156
00:12:45,437 --> 00:12:48,167
All the way from houston he said it to me on the phone last night.

157
00:12:48,273 --> 00:12:53,176
he said that he couldnt even get a hard on for any girl besides me no matter how good she was or what she did .

158
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:55,178
- and you believed him.
- I believe him.

159
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:59,339
Isnt that pathetic. I am as pathetic as that asshole on the street.

160
00:13:00,385 --> 00:13:03,183
- would you have believed him?
- No would but did.

161
00:13:03,388 --> 00:13:05,356
- he said the same things to you?
- word for word.

162
00:13:05,557 --> 00:13:09,118
And if that wasnt his big faith in you.
he said it was a matter of choice.

163
00:13:09,227 --> 00:13:10,785
without you he is incapacitated.

164
00:13:10,896 --> 00:13:14,297
- he would be impotent with anybody else.
- because i owned his dick, it didnt belong to him.

165
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,299
- it was attached to him.
- but it belong to me.

166
00:13:16,401 --> 00:13:20,303
Huge and hard, thick and long and perpendicular to the earth, not to the floor but the earth.

167
00:13:20,405 --> 00:13:23,306
- and filled with oceans...
- Oceans of cum.

168
00:13:23,408 --> 00:13:25,308
Oh my god. I am gonna fucking cut it off

169
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:28,811
I am gonna slice it off,
sliver by sliver

170
00:13:28,914 --> 00:13:31,212
with an electric meat slicer.

171
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,883
that is what im gonna do.

172
00:13:33,585 --> 00:13:36,213
- that motherfucker.
- You said it.

173
00:13:37,022 --> 00:13:39,388
- what?
- that's what he is: a motherfucker.

174
00:13:40,425 --> 00:13:42,393
You think he did it with his mother?

175
00:13:42,594 --> 00:13:45,256
Not litteraly, but i think his relationship with his mother

176
00:13:45,363 --> 00:13:47,331
is more complicated than he admits to.

177
00:13:47,432 --> 00:13:50,333
Definitely.
i mean who else has framed photographs

178
00:13:50,435 --> 00:13:52,335
of their mother all over their apartement

179
00:13:52,437 --> 00:13:54,837
And the way he used her in stories he would tell.

180
00:13:55,373 --> 00:13:57,773
like when he was little.
No father around.

181
00:13:57,876 --> 00:14:00,845
"Mother and i went to Florida, went to Atlantic City".

182
00:14:01,313 --> 00:14:04,009
"Mom and I had an argument over me having a ponytail".

183
00:14:04,216 --> 00:14:07,185
- Right.
- and the way he used her with us.

184
00:14:07,385 --> 00:14:10,218
- No Not with me, i never met her.
- I never met her either

185
00:14:10,322 --> 00:14:13,348
But the way he used her, saying he is spending the night at her house because she's sick.

186
00:14:14,392 --> 00:14:17,122
- You dont think she was sick?
- well, Who knows?

187
00:14:17,229 --> 00:14:20,221
all we knew is that he cant call her because the ringing sound would frighten her..

188
00:14:20,332 --> 00:14:24,132
Exactly. "Just leave a message on the voicemail if anything urgent came up".

189
00:14:24,236 --> 00:14:27,205
4 nights a week;
those were the nights he must have been with you.

190
00:14:27,405 --> 00:14:30,806
No i was always three,
Never 4, you must have been 4.

191
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:32,376
No, I was three also.

192
00:14:33,411 --> 00:14:35,379
well, do you think there is a third?

193
00:14:36,248 --> 00:14:38,580
Or one night of cruising recruitement for the future. .

194
00:14:40,252 --> 00:14:42,220
Can you believe we fell for this?

195
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,718
You only suspect it when you're doing it yourself.

196
00:14:45,757 --> 00:14:47,224
interesting.

197
00:14:48,426 --> 00:14:50,394
but you weren't fucking around on him, were you?

198
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:53,329
- No.
- neither was I.

199
00:14:53,431 --> 00:14:56,764
But i could have, i had plenty of chances

200
00:14:56,868 --> 00:14:58,597
like that guy on the street in the white suit ?

201
00:14:58,703 --> 00:15:00,193
Much better than him.

202
00:15:00,305 --> 00:15:03,331
I know that, i was just being vicisious.

203
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:04,842
right.

204
00:15:06,211 --> 00:15:08,475
but you must had a million chances.

205
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,275
- you're beautifull, Carla.
- No I am not.

206
00:15:10,382 --> 00:15:11,610
yes you are.

207
00:15:11,716 --> 00:15:13,115
Let me ask you something .

208
00:15:13,218 --> 00:15:14,276
what if he is here.

209
00:15:14,386 --> 00:15:15,353
Ok.

210
00:16:42,574 --> 00:16:44,371
Mommy,it's me im back.

211
00:16:45,343 --> 00:16:48,312
little trouble getting back from the airport, but the plane got on time.

212
00:16:48,413 --> 00:16:51,382
I love you. I hope you are doing well.
Call me as soon as you get this, bye.

213
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:10,262
Carla,  it's Blake.
I just got back in town.

214
00:17:10,368 --> 00:17:14,327
I am prepared to perforate your every orifice.

215
00:17:14,873 --> 00:17:18,206
with my tongue
i miss you wildly

216
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:21,938
i am hot, i got to see you. bye.

217
00:17:31,389 --> 00:17:32,515
Hi who is there?

218
00:17:33,324 --> 00:17:34,689
all right, well just tell her 

219
00:17:34,893 --> 00:17:37,361
...Blake is back.

220
00:17:38,396 --> 00:17:39,363
Thank you.

221
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,305
Mark! it's Blake.

222
00:17:58,283 --> 00:18:00,274
what is it like 4:30 there. get up.

223
00:18:03,288 --> 00:18:04,983
so what happened with the job, did you get it?

224
00:18:05,356 --> 00:18:08,189
No? why?
too talented as usual?

225
00:18:08,293 --> 00:18:12,252
what's going on?

226
00:18:14,532 --> 00:18:18,263
So what else?
what about like anything?

227
00:18:21,372 --> 00:18:25,331
Really? wow? and that's in the catskills?

228
00:18:26,311 --> 00:18:29,838
God, i actually dont know anyone who made it in the catskills.

229
00:18:30,315 --> 00:18:31,839
what are they paying there?

230
00:18:33,218 --> 00:18:35,948
Wow, that will cover the dry-cleaning.

231
00:18:36,321 --> 00:18:39,950
what about like a Tv spot or something?

232
00:18:40,391 --> 00:18:44,293
I cant even believe we are discussing this. this is ridiculous.

233
00:18:44,395 --> 00:18:46,886
it's like you dont know who are you dealing with here.

234
00:18:47,332 --> 00:18:49,357
you've been jerking quite a bit there?

235
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:52,301
No, im just kidding.

236
00:18:52,403 --> 00:18:54,303
Hold on. let me think about it for a second.

237
00:18:57,275 --> 00:18:59,675
Call me daddy,
Call me daddy.

238
00:18:59,777 --> 00:19:03,235
bend over and then squeal like the pig that you are 

239
00:19:03,348 --> 00:19:05,316
for offering me this job. 

240
00:19:06,284 --> 00:19:07,308
No, i'll take it.

241
00:19:08,286 --> 00:19:09,344
when do i start?

242
00:19:10,288 --> 00:19:12,654
Ok, thanks, bye.

243
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,315


244
00:19:25,203 --> 00:19:26,170
Hi.

245
00:19:26,871 --> 00:19:27,838
Yes.

246
00:19:29,374 --> 00:19:32,343
live, from "La Paz"...

247
00:19:33,878 --> 00:19:38,338
it is "Blanco Allegra".

248
00:19:46,391 --> 00:19:49,360
you give your hand to me...

249
00:19:51,396 --> 00:19:55,298
and then you say hello.

250
00:19:56,401 --> 00:19:59,370
and i can hardly speak

251
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:04,365
My heart is beating so

252
00:20:05,577 --> 00:20:08,375
and anyone can tell

253
00:20:11,349 --> 00:20:12,782
you think you know.

254
00:20:14,252 --> 00:20:20,384
No, you dont know me.

255
00:20:23,261 --> 00:20:26,230
No, you dont know the one

256
00:20:27,932 --> 00:20:31,390
who dreams of you at night.

257
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,399
Honey, i let my chance go by.

258
00:20:39,944 --> 00:20:45,405
and the chance you might have loved me too.

259
00:20:52,457 --> 00:20:56,359
you give your hand to me.

260
00:20:57,395 --> 00:21:00,364
and then you say goodbye.

261
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,368
i wont walk away

262
00:21:44,442 --> 00:21:47,343
what a surprising way to see you!

263
00:21:47,445 --> 00:21:50,346
i was just... My god!

264
00:21:50,448 --> 00:21:55,681
i was just thinking when im gonna see you. and here you are

265
00:21:56,321 --> 00:21:57,288
how did you get in?

266
00:21:57,388 --> 00:21:58,514
Magic.

267
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:02,257
did the super let you in?

268
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,688
You look great...fuck!

269
00:22:06,397 --> 00:22:07,364
Okay.

270
00:22:08,399 --> 00:22:11,800
You know what's so great?
i could have not orchestrated this any better.

271
00:22:11,903 --> 00:22:14,804
this is a rare opportunity, you get to see how i am behaving

272
00:22:14,906 --> 00:22:16,100
when you are not here.

273
00:22:16,207 --> 00:22:18,300
what did i do? i came in

274
00:22:18,409 --> 00:22:20,309
i sit in, is i call you the first thing i do is tell you i love you

275
00:22:20,411 --> 00:22:22,811
i miss you
i wanna lick you, i cant wait to see you

276
00:22:22,914 --> 00:22:25,246
got up, im inspired thinking im not gonna see you..

277
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:29,377
I sit down, i play, i sing...
how the fuck did you get in here?

278
00:22:36,427 --> 00:22:39,396
wow, you've never looked this phenomenal.

279
00:22:40,431 --> 00:22:42,558
did i give you a key?
i did, right?

280
00:22:42,934 --> 00:22:46,392
I am just so happy to see you. i really am, in this two weeks

281
00:22:46,938 --> 00:22:49,338
I forgotten how beautifull you are. and i missed you

282
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,271
did you miss me as much as i missed you?

283
00:22:51,376 --> 00:22:55,278
- how much did you miss me?
- pretty madly, like a psychotic.

284
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,282
- why do you think i was calling you 40 times a day.
- needed to check up on me?

285
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:03,782
what? what kind of crazy statement is that? why do i need to check up on you?

286
00:23:03,888 --> 00:23:06,789
- to see what i was up to.
- what are you talking about?

287
00:23:06,891 --> 00:23:09,553
- what do you suspect i would be up to?

288
00:23:10,228 --> 00:23:13,288
this conversation is getting real strange.

289
00:23:13,398 --> 00:23:14,865
what is going on?

290
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:16,357
what is going on?

291
00:23:16,901 --> 00:23:18,300
- nothing.
- nothing. 

292
00:23:18,403 --> 00:23:21,463
then why are you using words like suspect me?
like i would suspect you of something

293
00:23:21,572 --> 00:23:23,836
- and you dont?
- No, Suspect you of what?

294
00:23:23,941 --> 00:23:26,808
suspect you of anything why?
why would I?

295
00:23:26,911 --> 00:23:30,312
Never would i have tought you've done something wrong
- You dont think that?

296
00:23:30,415 --> 00:23:33,816
- No, why would I?
- I dont know. what you might think is wrong

297
00:23:33,918 --> 00:23:36,386
for me i might think its right
and viceversa.

298
00:23:38,423 --> 00:23:39,890
what are you trying to tell me?

299
00:23:40,091 --> 00:23:40,989
about what?

300
00:23:41,092 --> 00:23:42,059
About you.

301
00:23:42,427 --> 00:23:43,394
nothing.

302
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,329
did you fuck anybody?

303
00:23:55,206 --> 00:23:56,104
when?

304
00:23:56,207 --> 00:23:58,334
when, ever.

305
00:23:58,876 --> 00:24:00,002
Ever?

306
00:24:00,378 --> 00:24:02,209
well yes.

307
00:24:02,313 --> 00:24:05,282
I mean i seem to recall you and I have shared a little fucking.

308
00:24:05,383 --> 00:24:08,443
- Making love, come on.
- making love, is that what you wanna call it?

309
00:24:08,553 --> 00:24:11,283
that's what i call it, that's what it is to me when i was with you .

310
00:24:11,389 --> 00:24:13,448
- as supposed to what?
- as supposed to nothing

311
00:24:13,558 --> 00:24:15,788
what are you driving at?
Come on.

312
00:24:15,893 --> 00:24:18,361
How many girls did you fuck while you were in L.A?

313
00:24:18,896 --> 00:24:21,865
when i was in  L.A?
that's the last two weeks. None.

314
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,233
cause i havent been with any other women since i was with you .

315
00:24:25,336 --> 00:24:26,530
that's the last ten months.

316
00:24:27,238 --> 00:24:30,230
- you dont have to say that.
- I know i dont have to say that, I am just saying that because its the truth.

317
00:24:30,341 --> 00:24:31,433
i mean we are not married.

318
00:24:31,542 --> 00:24:33,806
you are a free man, you can do it whatever you want, it's okay if you have.

319
00:24:33,911 --> 00:24:36,311
i dont want to,  do you?

320
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:39,314
no.

321
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:40,384
well.

322
00:24:43,354 --> 00:24:45,322
- with anyone, you dont want to?
- with anyone but you.

323
00:24:45,423 --> 00:24:47,323
- okay whatever you say.
- whatever.

324
00:24:47,425 --> 00:24:51,327
this is got to be the most bizzare exchange

325
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:52,828
i've ever experienced in my life.

326
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,330
Did you take acid?

327
00:24:56,033 --> 00:24:58,194
did you, are you?

328
00:24:58,302 --> 00:25:01,271
i was trying to figure out some explanation

329
00:25:01,372 --> 00:25:05,172
for this Jekyl and hyde behaviour that you're exhebiting.

330
00:25:05,376 --> 00:25:06,434
I am scared.

331
00:25:06,544 --> 00:25:07,511
i dont...

332
00:25:14,385 --> 00:25:15,352
look.

333
00:25:18,389 --> 00:25:19,856
what's this?

334
00:25:22,393 --> 00:25:24,520
what's there?

335
00:25:26,397 --> 00:25:28,524
it looks like a broken windown and a plant.

336
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,461
yeah, i know it is a plant and a broken window, but the question is how did the window got broken?

337
00:25:35,406 --> 00:25:36,964
it looks like the plant might have done it.

338
00:25:37,074 --> 00:25:40,202
yeah, but i dont think that the plant just came through the window on its own.

339
00:25:41,412 --> 00:25:43,471
did you throw the plant to the window?

340
00:25:44,582 --> 00:25:46,709
did you throw this to the window?

341
00:25:49,587 --> 00:25:50,554
maybe

342
00:25:51,422 --> 00:25:52,389
maybe.

343
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,849
maybe?

344
00:25:59,196 --> 00:26:00,254
maybe?

345
00:26:00,865 --> 00:26:01,832
maybe.

346
00:26:03,367 --> 00:26:07,326
have you gone completely and utterly out of your mind?

347
00:26:09,373 --> 00:26:11,102
are you glad i came by to surprise you?

348
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:14,109
yeah, i am glad. i would be gladder if you met me in the airport or outside.

349
00:26:14,211 --> 00:26:16,441
I cant believe that you threw this plant through this window.

350
00:26:16,547 --> 00:26:20,449
I cant believe you're getting so upset about this window

351
00:26:20,551 --> 00:26:22,212
Than what?

352
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,288
then about your protestations
of fidelity

353
00:26:24,388 --> 00:26:26,788
they are not protestations.

354
00:26:26,891 --> 00:26:28,859
They are outright denials.

355
00:26:29,226 --> 00:26:32,218
it's beyond desires, it's beyond choice.
it's phallic incapacity

356
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,298
it's an inoperative shaft.

357
00:26:34,398 --> 00:26:37,128
I am telling you, if you would put a gun to my head

358
00:26:37,234 --> 00:26:40,226
and  say: "fuck her, she's gorgeous, she needs you, it's easy no one will know.

359
00:26:40,338 --> 00:26:43,307
I'll say: "Pull it, pull the trigger, empty the chamber into my head

360
00:26:43,407 --> 00:26:46,137
Because that's what its at with me.

361
00:26:46,243 --> 00:26:48,302
it's not my dick anymore, it is attached to me yeah. but it belongs to you

362
00:26:48,412 --> 00:26:52,143
I am taking it a step further, i am telling you that not only this point with you

363
00:26:52,249 --> 00:26:55,741
Because i am so attached to you that every other girl on earth is not exciting to me, in the slightest.

364
00:26:55,853 --> 00:26:58,253
every other girl on earth to me it's like a salem.

365
00:26:58,356 --> 00:27:01,257
it is like something that came from under a fucking rock.

366
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:03,088
it is disgusting to me!

367
00:27:03,194 --> 00:27:05,094
it is like smelling cheese.

368
00:27:05,196 --> 00:27:06,754
it makes me fucking sick.

369
00:27:06,864 --> 00:27:08,263
it disgusts me!

370
00:27:08,366 --> 00:27:10,300
it is like smelling vomit.

371
00:27:14,372 --> 00:27:15,839
including me?

372
00:27:18,376 --> 00:27:20,344
Wow! this is a shock!

373
00:27:21,379 --> 00:27:22,311
this is a Surprise!

374
00:27:22,413 --> 00:27:24,347
this is a massive shadow of shock.

375
00:27:24,882 --> 00:27:28,215
i must say it is difficult that either  one of you gonna believe me this moment, 

376
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:30,787
there is absolutely a legitimate explanation for this.
- what is it?

377
00:27:30,888 --> 00:27:32,287
he doesnt have an explanation.

378
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:35,450
just answer me one question,
in what way am i physically disgusting?

379
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:37,288
- no way.
- you just say i was.

380
00:27:37,395 --> 00:27:39,295
- when?
- when 30 seconds ago.

381
00:27:39,397 --> 00:27:42,298
- I didnt say.
- You just said that every girl you met since Carla...

382
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,301
was physically disgusting to you.
- it was a figure of speech.

383
00:27:45,403 --> 00:27:48,304
- Stop lying, asshole.
- i am not lying.

384
00:27:48,406 --> 00:27:51,307
Not lying? everything you have said to the both of us in the past ten months

385
00:27:51,409 --> 00:27:54,242
has been a total utter-fucking lie.
- can i say one thing.

386
00:27:54,345 --> 00:27:58,145
and this is not some self serving jarging on an attempt to get myself an out of the moment

387
00:27:58,349 --> 00:28:01,250
i even hide little tiny parts of my life from both of you to avoid causing pain.

388
00:28:01,352 --> 00:28:04,253
- Fuck you!
- I never said anything

389
00:28:04,355 --> 00:28:07,085
that i didnt not whole heartly mean.
- fuck you.

390
00:28:07,191 --> 00:28:09,659
If you actually believe what you just said, it's worse than if you dont.

391
00:28:11,362 --> 00:28:14,263
- I dont follow that at all.
- ¡Oh, what a big surprise!

392
00:28:14,365 --> 00:28:16,196
What, you know what she just meant by that?

393
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:20,259
- yeah, i understood perfectly what she said.
- well go ahead explain it to me.

394
00:28:20,371 --> 00:28:22,202
you know what, i dont have to tell you anything.

395
00:28:22,306 --> 00:28:25,901
you're just lucky you dont have a kitchen knife sticking through your adams apple right about now.

396
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,910
- Carla,
- i prefer you dont use my name.

397
00:28:28,946 --> 00:28:30,311
what do you want me to call you? Timmy?

398
00:28:30,414 --> 00:28:32,348
i dont wanna hear your voice at all right now.

399
00:28:33,217 --> 00:28:36,345

400
00:28:39,557 --> 00:28:40,489

404
00:28:46,397 --> 00:28:50,299
i didnt get it, but i got this other thing in the catskills that's gonna be real good.

405
00:28:50,401 --> 00:28:52,699
can i call you back in ten minutes? thanks.

406
00:28:53,237 --> 00:28:56,297
ten minutes, okay.

407
00:28:56,507 --> 00:28:58,737
- so there is a third.
- third what?

408
00:28:58,843 --> 00:29:00,640
- third girlfriend.
- that's absurd.

409
00:29:00,845 --> 00:29:04,246
you used your mother with me to get through with Carla .
you used your mother with Carla to get through with me

410
00:29:04,348 --> 00:29:08,409
and now, you're using your mother with both of us, to get with whoever it is you're planning on going out with tonight.

411
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:10,248
No, you dont understand.

412
00:29:10,354 --> 00:29:13,255
No, actually we didnt understand, 

413
00:29:13,357 --> 00:29:14,915
now we do understand

414
00:29:15,025 --> 00:29:16,185
we understand everything.

415
00:29:16,293 --> 00:29:18,090
everything except why

416
00:29:18,195 --> 00:29:20,254
it would be if you stopped lying.

417
00:29:20,364 --> 00:29:21,490
you were caught.

418
00:29:21,866 --> 00:29:24,767
stop and try to explain.

419
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:26,427
- he cant.
- let him try.

420
00:29:26,537 --> 00:29:27,504
go ahead.

421
00:29:28,372 --> 00:29:31,102
- My mom is

00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:33,267

For me, it is not like there was...

00:32:12,736 --> 00:32:16,365
this wasnt not supposed to have been

00:32:20,411 --> 00:32:21,537

00:33:09,393 --> 00:33:10,519
oh my god!

482
00:33:23,407 --> 00:33:24,806
okay, fine.

483
00:33:24,908 --> 00:33:26,535
he's about as dead as we are.

484
00:33:26,643 --> 00:33:28,873
listen i am about to teach a little something .

485
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,372
you fucking asshole,
how could you do that?

486
00:33:33,017 --> 00:33:35,315
you know how that feels,
you fucker?

487
00:33:35,419 --> 00:33:38,320
- pretending like you are dead, that's sadistic.
- i have a point to make.

488
00:33:38,422 --> 00:33:41,152
I am not interested in your point.

489
00:33:41,425 --> 00:33:44,223
i am interested in why you are a sick compulsive liar.

490
00:33:44,361 --> 00:33:46,886
you are caught in like a sewer of lies and deception

491
00:33:46,997 --> 00:33:49,192
and your response is a lie.

492
00:33:50,267 --> 00:33:53,168
you're right.
this is kind of fucked up, i am an actor

493
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:55,761
and actors lie.
- it gets worse and worse.

494
00:33:55,873 --> 00:33:57,841
i am not trying to excuse it, i am just

495
00:33:58,375 --> 00:34:02,038
alot of actors dont lie, there's alot of actors who play killers

496
00:34:02,146 --> 00:34:04,774
but they do not kill people when they are not acting.

497
00:34:04,882 --> 00:34:07,715
not good actors. name me one good actor who doesnt lie .

498
00:34:07,885 --> 00:34:10,285

even for you.

Yes, Denzel Washington
is a good actor.

503
00:34:21,398 --> 00:34:24,128
a good actor pursuades you upon reality and he lives another.

00:34:24,234 --> 00:34:26,293
Come on blake are you gonna tell me that

i saw him at "Grey's Papaya" like 2 weeks ago.

513
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:54,624
and i think i got a pretty firm hitch.

514
00:34:54,731 --> 00:34:58,258
i am not talking about Denzel Washington as an individual,
i am talking generically.

515
00:34:58,368 --> 00:35:01,201
i am talking about the art of acting,
the nature...

516
00:35:01,305 --> 00:35:03,432
the life experience of me as an actor.

517
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:07,203
so you're point is that it's okay for you to lie and live a double life

518
00:35:07,311 --> 00:35:08,938
because you're an actor?
- what i'm saying

519
00:35:09,046 --> 00:35:10,809
is that the two are connected

520
00:35:11,381 --> 00:35:13,872
If i was like a supreme court justice

521
00:35:13,984 --> 00:35:17,215
you would expect a little on the nose straight ahead answer .

522
00:35:17,321 --> 00:35:20,222
but as an actor i think that i am grand a little leeway .

523
00:35:20,324 --> 00:35:23,122
so this makes it our fault, we should know that you're a liar and a double dealer

524
00:35:23,227 --> 00:35:24,353
Clarence Thompson.

525
00:35:26,396 --> 00:35:28,296
who the fuck is
Clarence Thompson?

526
00:35:28,398 --> 00:35:31,526
the supreme court justice who lied about Anita Hill, duh.

527
00:35:33,403 --> 00:35:34,370
Thomas.

528
00:35:35,405 --> 00:35:38,306
- Thomas, who?
- Clarence Thomas.

529
00:35:38,408 --> 00:35:41,309
and there is no proof that he lied about anything actually.

530
00:35:41,411 --> 00:35:45,814
oh really, you think that  Anita Hill made up the whole coke character

531
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:48,316
are you intentionnaly missing my point ?

532
00:35:48,418 --> 00:35:51,478
No, i am not, you said that you're not a supreme court justice

533
00:35:51,588 --> 00:35:53,317
and i said that
Clarence Thompson

534
00:35:53,423 --> 00:35:58,258
is exactly the same lying cheating pathetic fucking fool as you are.

535
00:35:58,362 --> 00:36:01,263
okay! stop it both of you, you are letting him side track us

536
00:36:01,365 --> 00:36:03,265
from finding out why he is such a liar

537
00:36:03,367 --> 00:36:05,267
which is the only reason that i am still here.

538
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:07,496
that's a very good point, Carla.

539
00:36:08,038 --> 00:36:09,335
why i am still here?

540
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:12,168
i am fucking out of here.

541
00:36:13,377 --> 00:36:17,177
you treat two people that you claim to love with such contempt?

542
00:36:17,381 --> 00:36:19,849
it wasnt contempt.
that's the last thing it was.

543
00:36:21,385 --> 00:36:22,352
it was love.

544
00:36:23,387 --> 00:36:24,684
it was love.

545
00:36:25,355 --> 00:36:26,617
fuck you, Blake.

546
00:36:26,723 --> 00:36:29,783
And fuck you up and down, in and out

547
00:36:29,893 --> 00:36:33,124
front and rear, fuck you till you bleed and puss pores 

548
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,858
out of your asshole.

549
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,300
you are a lying,
mugging

550
00:36:38,402 --> 00:36:41,803
maschojonistic, inemployable, 

551
00:36:41,905 --> 00:36:43,702
short loft inheriting

552
00:36:43,807 --> 00:36:46,071
..piece of shit fraud

553
00:36:46,176 --> 00:36:49,270
and love, you have the audacity to use the word love?

554
00:36:49,379 --> 00:36:52,871
you dont know the meaning of the word love.
¡fuck you!

555
00:36:54,351 --> 00:36:56,148
i am short now too, huh?

556
00:36:57,354 --> 00:36:58,821
I make 5'10.

557
00:37:00,357 --> 00:37:01,255
short.

558
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:02,325
fraud.

559
00:37:06,296 --> 00:37:09,094
you know what do you want, to sell it?

560
00:37:11,368 --> 00:37:12,335
fine.

561
00:37:13,303 --> 00:37:14,736
you enjoy it.

562
00:37:32,389 --> 00:37:35,187
what is wrong with you?
why are you doing this?

563
00:37:36,326 --> 00:37:38,487
this is what you want, this is how you wanna live the rest of your life?

564
00:37:38,595 --> 00:37:41,359
Damaging people around you, damaging yourself?

565
00:37:42,399 --> 00:37:43,525
is it?

566
00:37:44,234 --> 00:37:46,293
Really is it? because if it is

567
00:37:47,337 --> 00:37:51,296
why dont you really fucking blow your brains out?

568
00:37:51,408 --> 00:37:52,375
Really, right now

569
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:03,252
that's not what you want, you need a comittement to shape your ass off

570
00:38:03,353 --> 00:38:05,321
and stop bullshitting everyone.

571
00:38:05,856 --> 00:38:09,314
stop deceiving them and yourself too.

572
00:38:10,327 --> 00:38:12,261
You should promise me this right now.

573
00:38:12,362 --> 00:38:16,492
A real promise.
The real deal now.

574
00:38:19,303 --> 00:38:21,999
allright, i promise.
i cant fucking believe you.

575
00:38:22,105 --> 00:38:24,335
I cant believe shit that you say.

576
00:38:27,711 --> 00:38:29,269
but im gonna give you a chance.

577
00:38:32,382 --> 00:38:34,282
this is your last chance

578
00:38:34,384 --> 00:38:36,352
to fucking get your shit together.

579
00:40:27,431 --> 00:40:30,332
i come in, and the second i walk in the door, 

580
00:40:30,434 --> 00:40:32,629
the ground floor, the door is open

581
00:40:32,736 --> 00:40:35,398
i look in there, and there's a body.

582
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,341
i dont know. No it is like the guy artist Rex.

583
00:40:39,443 --> 00:40:42,344
i dont know if it's him.
i dont know  who it is

584
00:40:42,446 --> 00:40:43,913
I call the police.

585
00:40:44,281 --> 00:40:49,344
they come over. and within 25 seconds of finding this body

586
00:40:49,453 --> 00:40:51,284
they call the coroners

587
00:40:51,388 --> 00:40:52,753
and they are grilling me, these detectives

588
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:55,485
when you called me they were relentless

589
00:40:55,592 --> 00:40:58,026
like i did it or something.

590
00:40:58,395 --> 00:41:01,626
and then maybe because of the time of the death of the body

591
00:41:01,731 --> 00:41:04,495
it was obvious that i couldnt ...

592
00:41:06,903 --> 00:41:09,371
stop you are smoking right now, i can hear it.

593
00:41:10,407 --> 00:41:12,204
you want some more?

594
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:15,207
i got too much already.

595
00:41:15,579 --> 00:41:17,376
pour me a little of yours.

596
00:41:20,417 --> 00:41:21,384
cheers.

597
00:41:29,092 --> 00:41:30,389
i know you're smoking, you dont have to tell me.

598
00:41:31,261 --> 00:41:32,250
you cant.

599
00:41:33,363 --> 00:41:36,389
yeah but i know, it's not even like i can sometimes or whatever.

600
00:41:37,267 --> 00:41:39,428
you have no idea,
i took you to the  hospital.

601
00:41:52,449 --> 00:41:53,575
that's enough.

602
00:41:58,221 --> 00:41:59,347
one more.

603
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,914
we'll finish the bottle.

604
00:42:03,326 --> 00:42:04,350
mom?

605
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:08,354
mom?

606
00:42:25,415 --> 00:42:27,315
did you throw away the cigarettes?

607
00:42:28,585 --> 00:42:31,383
well, mom you are destroying your voice

608
00:42:32,422 --> 00:42:33,548
No, i am serious.

609
00:42:34,424 --> 00:42:36,324
why are you talking so low?

610
00:42:39,429 --> 00:42:42,023
you are wrecking your circulation.

611
00:42:43,934 --> 00:42:46,334
you are strangling your circulation.

612
00:42:46,436 --> 00:42:49,405
Mom, the cigarette is like a nail.

613
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,238
well you just gotta stop. you want me to come over there, i'll come over there

614
00:42:53,443 --> 00:42:56,503
you think i could ever brade your hair?

615
00:42:57,047 --> 00:42:58,514
if you want to, you can.

616
00:42:58,615 --> 00:43:02,278
because i still like to brade my hair, but right now i have short hair.

617
00:43:04,387 --> 00:43:08,346
well call me if you need me okay? i love you, bye.

618
00:43:12,395 --> 00:43:13,362
Wow!

619
00:43:21,905 --> 00:43:25,033
Hey Blake, you wanna brade carlas hair with me?

620
00:43:25,408 --> 00:43:28,309
it could be fun.
we could brade our hair.

621
00:43:28,912 --> 00:43:31,540
- you want the truth?
- No, we want another lie.

622
00:43:31,915 --> 00:43:33,883
No, seriously.the truth

623
00:43:34,918 --> 00:43:37,148
- the truth
- look at him

624
00:43:37,253 --> 00:43:40,882
the very words "the truth is" make him draw a blank.

625
00:43:41,257 --> 00:43:44,488
the truth is that i meant everything that i said to each of you

626
00:43:44,594 --> 00:43:46,323
at the time i was saying it.
- bullshit!

627
00:43:46,429 --> 00:43:49,262
- No, it was new to me.
- oh, it was new to you!

628
00:43:49,366 --> 00:43:53,325
the first time i ever felt love was simultanuously with both of you

629
00:43:53,436 --> 00:43:55,199
for the first time ever in my life.

630
00:43:55,305 --> 00:43:59,674
and i was baffled.
it was very unsettling.

631
00:43:59,776 --> 00:44:01,266
poor you!

632
00:44:01,378 --> 00:44:03,278
poor fucking you.

633
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,780
i am not suggesting sympathy, 

634
00:44:05,882 --> 00:44:10,285
i am just trying to make some sense for this fiasco that i've created.

635
00:44:10,387 --> 00:44:12,787
obviously you made your point which was very confusing and unsettling

636
00:44:12,889 --> 00:44:14,288
we discovered as you put it

637
00:44:14,391 --> 00:44:17,519
that you were in love with two women at the same time, and?

638
00:44:17,894 --> 00:44:19,987
and it was exciting.

639
00:44:20,397 --> 00:44:22,922
if you wanna know the truth. it never occured to me

640
00:44:23,033 --> 00:44:25,194
at any point to give up either one of you.

641
00:44:25,335 --> 00:44:26,962
because both of you made me feel

642
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:28,833
phenomenal when i was with you.

643
00:44:29,005 --> 00:44:32,873
i was under the impression that i am totally inspiring both of you.

644
00:44:33,343 --> 00:44:35,470
so as long that we dont know about each other then it was OK.

645
00:44:35,578 --> 00:44:39,309
i am not saying it's okay, it was wrong

646
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:43,147
but the rightness of it that i felt gave me a way of justifying .

647
00:44:43,253 --> 00:44:45,312
a way of seeing it the way i wanna see it

648
00:44:45,422 --> 00:44:47,219
so i can continue.

649
00:44:47,424 --> 00:44:49,790
you are such a manipulator!

650
00:44:49,926 --> 00:44:54,124
Manupilatish? No it is not,
because it requires conceiling, i am conceiling nothing.

651
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:55,754
- since when?
- since now.

652
00:44:55,865 --> 00:44:58,527
i absolutely think you're lying. you're definitely conceiling something.

653
00:44:58,635 --> 00:45:01,195
- it is too easy.
- yeah, it is too fucking easy.

654
00:45:01,304 --> 00:45:03,329
- it is too fast.
- what am i conceiling?

655
00:45:04,374 --> 00:45:06,171
you mean i could be aware of it.

656
00:45:06,376 --> 00:45:08,344
lying comes like breathing to you.

657
00:45:13,316 --> 00:45:15,011
Mom, hi it's me listen im sorry to call you back

658
00:45:15,118 --> 00:45:16,642
but your voice sounds really weird .

659
00:45:17,387 --> 00:45:19,184
it is really low.

660
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:22,290
why are you talking like that mom?

661
00:45:22,392 --> 00:45:24,189
im scared.

662
00:45:24,327 --> 00:45:27,353
i will call you right back.
i think it is the connection..

663
00:45:27,897 --> 00:45:29,524
i will call you right back. Hold on.

664
00:45:34,404 --> 00:45:36,201
why is this funny to you?

665
00:45:36,406 --> 00:45:37,703
i've been concerned.

666
00:45:39,909 --> 00:45:42,537
Hi are you sure you okay?

667
00:45:44,247 --> 00:45:47,216
im sorry, i just dont understand why 

668
00:45:51,354 --> 00:45:52,548
i know, but just let me

669
00:45:53,423 --> 00:45:55,755
ok i am here and i am worried about you

670
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:57,326
if i dont

671
00:45:59,362 --> 00:46:01,489
okay, sorry.

672
00:46:03,366 --> 00:46:05,266
she is upset of me.

673
00:46:05,368 --> 00:46:08,098
there is something wrong a with her voice it's so strange.

674
00:46:08,204 --> 00:46:10,764
Blake, how is it your mother has been sick 

675
00:46:10,874 --> 00:46:13,342
for like 10 months?

676
00:46:16,312 --> 00:46:19,338
that's what you have been saying right?

677
00:46:20,383 --> 00:46:23,352
- yeah
- if there is a real change in her voice

678
00:46:23,453 --> 00:46:24,943
you should call a doctor.

679
00:46:25,054 --> 00:46:26,180
i know, i am going to call him.

680
00:46:30,393 --> 00:46:31,951
Hi Dr. Cutler, please.

681
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:37,265
can you tell him that blake allan called it is very important.

682
00:46:39,903 --> 00:46:41,871
he has my number, thank you.

683
00:47:01,357 --> 00:47:02,324
what?

684
00:47:15,872 --> 00:47:18,340
So you're never gonna believe anything i say again?

685
00:47:19,309 --> 00:47:20,833
i would be pretty stupid to, wouldn't I?

686
00:47:21,211 --> 00:47:23,270
havent you ever lied to anyone

687
00:47:23,379 --> 00:47:27,110
and known what it done, and felt horrible about it

688
00:47:27,217 --> 00:47:29,845
and known that you could never do it again?

689
00:47:30,386 --> 00:47:33,685
known it meant nothing, or known that they've gone ahead and did it anyway ?

690
00:47:35,558 --> 00:47:37,856
i guess what i am asking is

691
00:47:38,394 --> 00:47:40,362
Can you forgive me?

692
00:47:57,347 --> 00:47:59,315
So explain something to me.

693
00:48:00,683 --> 00:48:04,312
did it excite you to know that you were always in danger of being caught?

694
00:48:05,655 --> 00:48:06,815
it must have.

695
00:48:07,357 --> 00:48:08,824
it excited you.

696
00:48:09,859 --> 00:48:11,258
- it had to.
- No.

697
00:48:11,361 --> 00:48:15,263
oh yes it did. you were exciting yourself by living a double life.

698
00:48:15,365 --> 00:48:17,333
you were risking disaster.

699
00:48:17,533 --> 00:48:19,194
of course it excited you.

700
00:48:19,302 --> 00:48:21,827
- if it did , i wasnt aware of it.
- you were aware.

701
00:51:08,924 --> 00:51:10,391
where the fuck are you going?

702
00:52:51,317 --> 00:52:53,842
- i have to make a call.
- what, i have a phone here.

703
00:52:54,554 --> 00:52:56,249
it is private.

704
00:53:10,403 --> 00:53:12,200
why didnt you went after her?

705
00:53:12,905 --> 00:53:16,306
- she doesnt want me too.
- but you would if she did.

706
00:53:17,343 --> 00:53:18,332
it's ok you can admit it

707
00:53:18,444 --> 00:53:20,605
i understand perfectly why you are attracted to her.

708
00:53:20,713 --> 00:53:24,308
she is great, she's beautifull, clever, she is a good person 

709
00:53:24,417 --> 00:53:28,319
and she knows how to take care of herself i mean what more can somebody wants?

710
00:53:28,421 --> 00:53:30,821
Nothing, but you have all those qualities too.

711
00:53:30,923 --> 00:53:34,324
No,i dont and you know it.
i am not beautifull, i am cute.

712
00:53:34,427 --> 00:53:37,328
i am not clever,
i am street wise.

713
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:42,263
i am not a very good person; i mean the only thing i am is self-sufficient.

714
00:53:42,368 --> 00:53:45,769
- i do know how to take care of myself.
- And you are a good person, dont say that about yourself.

715
00:53:45,872 --> 00:53:47,965
- No, i am not.
- how can you say that?

716
00:53:48,074 --> 00:53:50,269
how do you know?
you dont even know me

717
00:53:50,376 --> 00:53:54,107
i tought i knew you better than anyone who'd ever known you .
i tought i knew you better than you knew yourself

718
00:53:54,213 --> 00:53:56,841
- that's what you said.
- No, that's what you said.

719
00:53:57,383 --> 00:54:01,513
Maybe i did, maybe i said it because i knew that is what you wanted to hear.

720
00:54:01,888 --> 00:54:05,289
the way everything you said to me was what you tought i wanted to hear.

721
00:54:05,391 --> 00:54:07,859
right up to just now, when you did it again.

722
00:54:08,394 --> 00:54:10,191
speaking of which

723
00:54:10,396 --> 00:54:12,660
i noticed that you didnt correct me when i said that i was

724
00:54:12,765 --> 00:54:15,290
Cute instead of beautifull

725
00:54:15,401 --> 00:54:18,268
and street-wise instead of clever.

726
00:54:23,576 --> 00:54:25,544
you're thinking about Carla.

727
00:54:27,413 --> 00:54:30,871
see if you had been honest from the begining

728
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:34,879
things might have worked out alot better for all three of us.

729
00:54:35,588 --> 00:54:39,319
and much more interestingly

730
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:41,986
how so?

731
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:45,229
sometimes you underestimate people.

732
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,765
what meaning by underestimated you?

733
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:53,271
No, meaning that i might have been ready for certain things.

734
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:54,431
such as?

735
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:57,338
such as alot of things.

736
00:54:57,877 --> 00:54:59,344
such as?

737
00:55:00,546 --> 00:55:04,175
Diferent things. and Carla might have been ready too.

738
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:07,353
- for what?
- ú you know what i'm talking about.

739
00:55:07,553 --> 00:55:09,282
i know, i just want to hear you say it.

740
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,289
- i am sure you do.
- so?

741
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:13,291
Use your imagination.

742
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:14,325
so what you're saying is

743
00:55:14,427 --> 00:55:16,292
what i am saying is that you blew it.

744
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:19,456
you didnt have the confidence in yourself to believe that

745
00:55:19,565 --> 00:55:21,294
you could get what you wanted with the truth.

746
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:23,301
what did i want that i didnt get?

747
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:25,837
half of what you just got in there.

748
00:55:25,938 --> 00:55:28,304
- you mean double?
- yeah right, double.

749
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:32,310
like what, that i would have been with both of you together?

750
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:35,904
like that was my secret desire and i was too timid to admit it.

751
00:55:36,015 --> 00:55:39,143
Well, no.
i am not saying just sex.

752
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:41,243
and i am not saying sex once.

753
00:55:41,354 --> 00:55:42,753
what do you mean?

754
00:55:42,855 --> 00:55:44,686
i am refering to

755
00:55:45,858 --> 00:55:46,916
mormonism.

756
00:55:47,193 --> 00:55:48,251
mormonism?

757
00:55:48,361 --> 00:55:49,293
Mormonism.

758
00:55:49,395 --> 00:55:51,192
i think you mean bigamie.

759
00:55:51,297 --> 00:55:54,425
yeas, bigamie right. but not about the whole gang marriage

760
00:55:54,534 --> 00:55:57,264
just more of us hanging out together.

761
00:55:57,370 --> 00:56:01,272
and doing things together, just being together all the time.

762
00:56:01,374 --> 00:56:04,104
more like a triple instead of a couple.

763
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:05,609
so that's what you would have wanted?

764
00:56:05,711 --> 00:56:07,110
No, that's how you would have wanted it.

765
00:56:07,213 --> 00:56:10,273
you just didnt have the whatever to admit it.

766
00:56:10,383 --> 00:56:12,578
- and you think that's what Carla would want?
- Maybe.

767
00:56:12,685 --> 00:56:15,210
i think that she would be open to it.

768
00:56:15,321 --> 00:56:18,347
i think that we could convince her.

769
00:56:23,362 --> 00:56:24,351
excuse me.

770
00:56:30,336 --> 00:56:33,305
hello? Hi, Dr. Cutler,
thanks for calling me back.

771
00:56:33,406 --> 00:56:36,307
listen i've talked to mom, like three four

772
00:56:36,409 --> 00:56:38,707
a bunch of times today and there is 

773
00:56:38,845 --> 00:56:41,245
something in the level of her voice that's got me like frightenend.

774
00:56:41,347 --> 00:56:45,249
and i just want you , could you call her,
and call me back.

775
00:56:45,351 --> 00:56:46,875
and tell me what i should do?

776
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:56,260
No, i am telling you, i know something is wrong.

777
00:56:56,362 --> 00:57:01,163
i just want you to call her, call me back, and tell me what is to be done.

778
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:03,825
this is turning out to be a very strange day

779
00:57:06,205 --> 00:57:07,900
everything is changing so fast.

780
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:11,272
everything seems to be going form one extreme to an other and back again

781
00:57:11,377 --> 00:57:14,278
almost as if like  love and hate were interchangeable.

782
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:17,176
no i dont mean interchangeable
i mean inverted.

783
00:57:17,216 --> 00:57:19,514
Especially now
for us with him.

784
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:23,220
i mean there is a part of me that feels like we could just tell him to fuck off

785
00:57:23,322 --> 00:57:24,687
and never see him again.

786
00:57:24,891 --> 00:57:27,689
but then i was also thinking that we could try something else.

787
00:57:27,894 --> 00:57:31,352
something new, modern
and kind of strange.

788
00:57:32,231 --> 00:57:35,132
like this famous poet.
do you know what i am talking about?

789
00:57:35,234 --> 00:57:38,226
excuse me. Am i right in assuming that i am not wanted in this moment .

790
00:57:38,337 --> 00:57:40,237
- yes.
- or for longer than a moment.

791
00:57:40,339 --> 00:57:41,806
then i will vanish.

792
00:57:42,341 --> 00:57:46,243
- so which famous poet?
- i cant remember his name.

793
00:57:46,345 --> 00:57:49,246
but there was a biography the other night that i watched on calbe.

794
00:57:49,348 --> 00:57:51,248
he had a wife and a mistress.

795
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:55,184
and they did everything together, and the women really got along.

796
00:57:55,288 --> 00:57:58,155
they were attracted to each other, they respected each other

797
00:57:58,291 --> 00:58:00,259
and there were no jealousy or possesiveness

798
00:58:00,359 --> 00:58:02,657
i mean, it was really very cool.

799
00:58:02,995 --> 00:58:05,259
and i just cant remember his fucking name.

800
00:58:05,364 --> 00:58:06,831
D.H. Lawrence?

801
00:58:07,366 --> 00:58:11,097
No. wasnt he the Lawrence of arabia guy, wasnt he gay?

802
00:58:11,203 --> 00:58:13,194
No, that was T.E. Lawrence.

803
00:58:13,306 --> 00:58:14,864
No, this guy had a weird name.

804
00:58:14,974 --> 00:58:17,534
it sounded like a zz,
like Ezzard...

805
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:18,836
Ezra Pound.

806
00:58:19,211 --> 00:58:21,338
yes, Ezra Pound, that's it!

807
00:58:21,547 --> 00:58:23,276
i tought you vanished.

808
00:58:23,382 --> 00:58:25,282
What are you doing?

809
00:58:25,384 --> 00:58:27,352
i mean really,
what are you doing?

810
00:58:28,387 --> 00:58:32,289
are you trying to figure out how to make us forget?

811
00:58:32,391 --> 00:58:36,293
are you searching for a new role to slip into because this old one doesnt work ?

812
00:58:36,395 --> 00:58:40,126
are you lost? Nervous?
 you look nervous.

813
00:58:40,232 --> 00:58:41,859
are you practising your act?

814
00:58:42,401 --> 00:58:45,302
- i am a practising actor.
- you are trying too hard.

815
00:58:45,404 --> 00:58:47,201
- i am a good actor.
- right.

816
00:58:47,406 --> 00:58:49,465
- i am not a hack.
- oh really?

817
00:58:49,575 --> 00:58:51,509
obviously you have never seen my hamlet

818
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:55,240
or you wouldnt be parading me in this fashion, you'd have respect for me. you would.

819
00:58:55,414 --> 00:58:58,144
you see that picture over there?
i am the melancholic Dane.

820
00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:00,047
did Hamlet lead a double life?

821
00:59:02,421 --> 00:59:04,821
- so you want center stage?
- yes.

822
00:59:04,924 --> 00:59:06,391
always trying to be loved.

823
00:59:06,759 --> 00:59:07,817
ok.

824
00:59:09,362 --> 00:59:12,559
Hamlet i upset with his mother, for amongst many things.

825
00:59:13,399 --> 00:59:17,165
.Co-conspiring to kill his father, and also, owning his dick. 

826
00:59:17,269 --> 00:59:19,260
you could relate to that one.

827
00:59:19,372 --> 00:59:21,340
No, but i can relate how angry he is.

828
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,340
and on how she controls his dick

829
00:59:23,442 --> 00:59:24,374
ok.

830
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:26,206
it's coming.

831
00:59:29,448 --> 00:59:30,415
"Extacy.

- i like your singing better.

856
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:00,364
You do?

857
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:21,253
where did you grab that line, i didnt know that you're into Shakespear .

858
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,225
there's alot you dont know about me.

859
01:01:23,362 --> 01:01:25,887
yeah i know, like who did you just go outside to call?

860
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:28,400
- my mother.
- really?

861
01:01:30,402 --> 01:01:33,838
see by the way you are looking,
i know that you didnt call your mom.

862
01:01:33,939 --> 01:01:36,840
my mother, why is it so hard for you to believe that i am calling my mother ?

863
01:01:36,942 --> 01:01:38,933
arent you calling your mother all the time?

864
01:01:39,044 --> 01:01:41,274
yeah, my mom is not well.

865
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:44,281
i would never lie about Whether or not my mom was well.

866
01:01:44,383 --> 01:01:46,283
well who knows you've lied about everything else.

867
01:01:46,385 --> 01:01:48,649
I've lied about nothing except sexual fidelity.

868
01:01:48,754 --> 01:01:51,222
oh that's really nothing, isnt it?
Hardly worth mentioning.

869
01:01:51,323 --> 01:01:54,292
it is one tiny infitisemal glitch on the radar screen.

870
01:01:54,393 --> 01:01:56,224
yeah and what do you mean about sexual fidelity?

871
01:01:56,328 --> 01:01:59,229
do you mean it was just the two of us for the last year?

872
01:01:59,331 --> 01:02:02,300
- that i was lying to, yeah
- Oh,that you were lying to.

873
01:02:02,401 --> 01:02:05,234
but what about casual acquaintaces that you didnt have to lie to

874
01:02:05,337 --> 01:02:08,204
because they didnt care what you did, or who you did it with?

875
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:11,036
- those were a few, a very few.
- how few is very few?

876
01:02:11,243 --> 01:02:13,234
I tought we were beyond this

877
01:02:13,345 --> 01:02:17,304
what made you think that we were beyond it?

878
01:02:17,416 --> 01:02:19,213
because we had a little moment?

879
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:21,946
- a moment?
- yes, a little moment which changed nothing.

880
01:02:22,054 --> 01:02:24,318
just as when i went outside, you and lou had a little moment.

881
01:02:24,423 --> 01:02:26,254
Which changed nothing either.

882
01:02:26,358 --> 01:02:29,384
- we didnt touch each other.
- He is actually telling the truth this time.

883
01:02:29,595 --> 01:02:31,153
it didnt even come up.

884
01:02:31,263 --> 01:02:33,288
- Why not?
- i would've not let him.

885
01:02:33,399 --> 01:02:34,832
that tought never crossed my mind.

886
01:02:34,934 --> 01:02:38,165
- oh that's nice! thank you very much.
- you said you would havent anyway.

887
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:39,496
Well!

888
01:02:42,374 --> 01:02:43,841
how few is few?

889
01:02:44,376 --> 01:02:45,343
five.

890
01:02:47,379 --> 01:02:49,176
seven, sorry seven.

891
01:02:51,383 --> 01:02:54,284
- it was less than 10.
- less than 10?

892
01:02:55,054 --> 01:02:59,115
less than 10? do i hear twenty? thirty? fifty?

893
01:02:59,225 --> 01:03:03,286
how do you think i am ? Nero?
i am not Wilt Chamberlain.

894
01:03:03,395 --> 01:03:04,794
No, but you are desperately  

895
01:03:04,897 --> 01:03:06,592
obsessed and totally out of control.

896
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:08,530
dont deny it, Blake, you are.

897
01:03:08,901 --> 01:03:11,301
well, maybe i am out of control.

898
01:03:11,403 --> 01:03:13,371
often, usually.

899
01:03:13,906 --> 01:03:15,533
I mean do you really wanna do this?

900
01:03:15,641 --> 01:03:19,236
cause this will open the door of utter inhibited disclosure.

901
01:03:19,345 --> 01:03:21,813
do you really wanna hear names, dates places

902
01:03:21,914 --> 01:03:25,315
who wanted to be licked where, fucked how?

903
01:03:25,417 --> 01:03:29,251
or in my estimation, what do i think your personnal defects are ?

904
01:03:29,355 --> 01:03:32,813
or what you are ready to hear
or what you dont wanna hear secretly?

905
01:03:32,925 --> 01:03:37,225
or what if i told you what I thought about you, would devestate you to hear?

906
01:03:37,363 --> 01:03:40,764
what you are saying is the reason that we're in this situation

907
01:03:40,866 --> 01:03:42,493
is because of our personnal defects?

908
01:03:42,601 --> 01:03:45,502
what kind of girl would wanna get with a guy like me, knowing?

909
01:03:45,604 --> 01:03:47,267
- we didnt know.

910
01:03:48,375 --> 01:03:50,775
you never even let us get to know you that's the thing

911
01:03:50,877 --> 01:03:54,209
because you tought if we get to know you and see who you are and we wouldnt wanna be with you.

912
01:03:54,313 --> 01:03:57,180
why werent you honest from the begining?
I never told you

913
01:03:57,316 --> 01:04:00,774
You could have said:
"i cannot be faithful".

914
01:04:00,886 --> 01:04:03,377
why did you make it into some kind of fucking romance ,
that you didnt believe in?

915
01:04:03,489 --> 01:04:06,287
You know i thing you've been avoiding us this whole time, by calling your mother .

916
01:04:06,392 --> 01:04:08,121
it is like you are obsessed with your mother

917
01:04:08,227 --> 01:04:11,856
I mean we cant even talk to you for 2 seconds, cause you're on the phone talking to your mother.

918
01:04:12,331 --> 01:04:15,300
you substituted her for having a real relationship in your life.

919
01:04:15,401 --> 01:04:17,995
stop talking about my mom.
this is not right.

920
01:04:18,103 --> 01:04:19,661
everything is from your point of view.

921
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:24,800
you are not fucking interested in us, because you're so fucking into your own head, how fucking charming and funny

922
01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:28,641
and everything you just fucking avoid it. and you dont care about us and our problems at all.

923
01:04:28,747 --> 01:04:31,307
all you care about is fucking convincing yourself that you are so desirable

924
01:04:31,417 --> 01:04:33,908
by getting alot of women to fuck you.

925
01:04:34,019 --> 01:04:36,146
you dont even know how to be like just a person.

926
01:04:36,255 --> 01:04:38,485
just a clear simple person.

927
01:04:38,857 --> 01:04:43,089
and this is probably the most truthfull moment in your life right now, am i right?

928
01:04:43,195 --> 01:04:46,096
i cant believe that you're just dumping all this shit on me .

929
01:04:46,198 --> 01:04:50,760
it is really fucked up, i would never get off on just sitting out

930
01:04:50,869 --> 01:04:53,770
railing into somebody and telling them their character defects. it is just twisted

931
01:04:53,872 --> 01:04:55,635
- so you think you really know me ?
- yeah.

932
01:04:55,874 --> 01:04:59,275
- and you know all my faults and all that?
- pretty well.

933
01:04:59,378 --> 01:05:01,642
okay, how many guys do you think i fucked?

934
01:05:02,381 --> 01:05:04,008
None,
you said none.

935
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:06,511
that's right but you said none too, havent you?

936
01:05:06,885 --> 01:05:11,345
not only its what you've told me. but i just know that you're probably incapable of it.

937
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:14,324
you dont think i know what sexual temptation is?

938
01:05:19,398 --> 01:05:22,026
so how many guys do you think i fucked since i've been with you?

939
01:05:22,134 --> 01:05:23,192
none.

940
01:05:23,402 --> 01:05:24,369
more.

941
01:05:24,903 --> 01:05:25,801
one.

942
01:05:25,904 --> 01:05:26,871
more.

943
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:28,303
Two, you are lying.

944
01:05:28,407 --> 01:05:30,307
- more.
- Three. i know what you're doing.

945
01:05:30,409 --> 01:05:33,378
- you are just trying to
- more.

946
01:05:34,246 --> 01:05:36,305
- Four?
- yes, four.

947
01:05:36,415 --> 01:05:40,317
but maybe it was three because one was Vittorio, he was a repeat.

948
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:45,582
do you wanna hear how these guys like to be degraded

949
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:48,182
or how do they like being licked or touched or fucked?

950
01:05:48,293 --> 01:05:51,160
do you want a comparative description of dick size,
including your own?

951
01:05:51,363 --> 01:05:52,830
i dont like this.

952
01:05:53,365 --> 01:05:54,764
do you still love me?

953
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:57,267
am i still your one, your only one that you love?

954
01:05:57,369 --> 01:06:00,338
Are you incapable of getting excited by anyone except me?

955
01:06:03,308 --> 01:06:04,502
I cant.

956
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:07,175
i mean do you still love me.

957
01:06:08,981 --> 01:06:11,609
Okay i know what you're trying to do, i kind of understand it even though

958
01:06:11,717 --> 01:06:16,279
its twisted and really psychotic for you to do it, but i will forgive you

959
01:06:16,388 --> 01:06:18,822
Just stop, it's not working .

960
01:06:18,924 --> 01:06:21,119
you can call him, he's at Soho if you dont believe me.

961
01:06:21,226 --> 01:06:23,285
Cause he is staying there, penthouse five.

962
01:06:23,395 --> 01:06:26,296
And in fact he threatened to tell you if you dont go see him tonight.

963
01:06:26,398 --> 01:06:30,801
i just know you would never do it because you would've never reacted with such anger

964
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:32,461
To what i did, if you were doing it yourself.

965
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:33,868
Because if you have

966
01:06:33,972 --> 01:06:37,237
then you are so much more fucked up than i am.

967
01:06:37,342 --> 01:06:41,176
At least i am fucking finally telling you the truth, and you dont need to pull it out of me.

968
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:46,183
See, i wasnt trying to hurt you. Now you're doing it to me, with the intention of being hurtful

969
01:06:46,285 --> 01:06:48,276
I am not trying to hurt you, i am only trying to get on 

970
01:06:48,387 --> 01:06:52,084
some honest ground where i feel like the rug is gonna be pulled off from under me .

971
01:06:52,191 --> 01:06:54,421
u fuck Vittorio?
Vittorio?

972
01:06:54,526 --> 01:06:56,255
That Chippendales jurk?

973
01:06:56,361 --> 01:06:58,955
I wanna be on honest ground too.

974
01:06:59,364 --> 01:07:01,992
I understand completely what Carlas saying.

975
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:09,329
Right.

976
01:07:10,375 --> 01:07:11,672
Three girls.

977
01:07:16,882 --> 01:07:18,281
Three girls.

978
01:07:27,893 --> 01:07:29,360
I am so glad i said it.

979
01:07:29,895 --> 01:07:33,296
you know what, this isnt even going well.

980
01:07:33,398 --> 01:07:35,332
this little thing you guys set up to fuck me.

981
01:07:35,434 --> 01:07:37,129
No. we have not discuss this.

982
01:07:37,236 --> 01:07:39,397
I had no idea that she was gonna say this

983
01:07:39,505 --> 01:07:41,405
and i am sure she had no idea that i was gonna say this .

984
01:07:41,507 --> 01:07:42,804
jesus christ!

985
01:07:43,342 --> 01:07:46,072
And this just proves to both of us

986
01:07:46,345 --> 01:07:49,246
- Girls?
that we were sort of unsatisfied with you

987
01:07:49,348 --> 01:07:52,249
Girls!
so you are essentialy  a carpet muncher?

988
01:07:52,351 --> 01:07:54,251
and i find that term offensive.

989
01:07:54,353 --> 01:07:56,253
- I am sorry.
- i find that term offensive.

990
01:07:56,355 --> 01:07:57,287
Clamp bumper.

991
01:07:57,389 --> 01:07:59,254
No, I am an evolved woman

992
01:07:59,358 --> 01:08:01,758
that realize that is you can get alot out of

993
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:03,555
a relationship from a woman.

994
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:07,758
like sensitivity,trust, nurturing that you cannot get out of a man .

995
01:08:07,866 --> 01:08:10,266
- You know there's like a gray area
- I cant fucking believe 

996
01:08:10,369 --> 01:08:15,272
that you came here and have driven my ass into the ground for 45 minutes

997
01:08:15,374 --> 01:08:18,207
Holding all this information of what you two been up to.

998
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:21,279
- this is fucking nuts .
- this is not over

999
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:25,282
You fucked four other guys, and you've been with three women?

1000
01:08:25,384 --> 01:08:27,284
- yeah.
- this is pathetic.

1001
01:08:27,386 --> 01:08:29,217
Why are you so shocked?

1002
01:08:29,321 --> 01:08:33,280
Shocked? this fucking last hour you've been railing into me about this bullshit.

1003
01:08:33,392 --> 01:08:37,226
You are eating pussy, you are fucking three other guys and Vittorio .

1004
01:08:37,329 --> 01:08:38,796
Fuck both of you!

1005
01:08:38,897 --> 01:08:41,798
You should have know that we're doing this

1006
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:45,301
why does it matter if you love them or not? this is fucking ridiculous.

1007
01:08:45,404 --> 01:08:47,269
oh yeah, well have you loved anyone?

1008
01:08:48,307 --> 01:08:51,299
did you really love me, did you really love Lou?
have you ever loved anyone?

1009
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:54,811
Can you spare in between all the time you're fucking all these different people?

1010
01:08:54,913 --> 01:08:56,881
do you have time to like have a feeling?

1011
01:08:57,349 --> 01:08:58,839
and it doesnt feel very good, does it?

1012
01:08:58,951 --> 01:09:00,885
did you ever had any real feeling?

1013
01:09:02,321 --> 01:09:06,382
or did you just like play Hamlet all the time and pretend to have real feelings?

1014
01:09:08,594 --> 01:09:13,395
Look, i made my suggestion and i tought it was a good one .

1015
01:09:14,433 --> 01:09:15,900
Two girls and a guy.

1016
01:09:16,435 --> 01:09:19,563
But it seems like you guys are a little to conventional to that .

1017
01:09:20,272 --> 01:09:21,398
and that's okay.

1018
01:09:33,285 --> 01:09:37,244
Hello? Dr. Cutler, thanks for calling me back, so did you talk to her?

1019
01:09:37,389 --> 01:09:38,356
Yeah.

1020
01:09:40,892 --> 01:09:45,022
No, i think there was a very significant drop in her voice, 50% at least.

1021
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:50,232
well no offence, maybe you dont know i've talked to her three times a day

1022
01:09:50,335 --> 01:09:51,893
and i know there is something different.

1023
01:09:52,404 --> 01:09:54,372
do you think it is possible that ?

1024
01:09:54,906 --> 01:09:56,373
yes, she's still smoking.

1025
01:09:57,242 --> 01:09:59,472
i dont know what she told you,
but that's the truth.

1026
01:10:01,913 --> 01:10:03,608
well when you tell me not to worry

1027
01:10:03,715 --> 01:10:05,376
dont worry, I am worried!

1028
01:10:09,421 --> 01:10:10,979
your proffesional opinion?

1029
01:10:11,423 --> 01:10:15,154
listen, i know my mother and i am telling you there is something wrong with ther.

1030
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:17,387
and i think that she should probably be admitted today.

1031
01:10:21,433 --> 01:10:24,834
well i dont think that's acceptable. allright, so if you're not gonna be in the office 

1032
01:10:24,936 --> 01:10:26,801
then give me

1033
01:10:27,606 --> 01:10:31,337
you want me to call you? do you want me to track you down to the 9th hole?

1034
01:10:31,443 --> 01:10:35,402
I am telling you that i need your help, and you're telling me not to worry, and i am worried.

1035
01:10:37,883 --> 01:10:39,851
well then refer me to someone else.

1036
01:10:41,386 --> 01:10:44,355
I am telling you there's something wrong, i got to bring her in.

1037
01:10:47,392 --> 01:10:50,361
I am relaxed, but i dont understand why you're...

1038
01:10:53,398 --> 01:10:54,865
what do you suggest?

1039
01:10:56,401 --> 01:10:58,266
is that all you have to say?

1040
01:11:03,041 --> 01:11:04,372
you are a fucking kwack.

1041
01:11:06,411 --> 01:11:08,208
I'll do it myself.

1042
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:10,872
i am tired of this bullshit.

1043
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:15,217
I am gonna go upstairs and make a phone call.

1044
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:19,313
okay, I apologise if i was deragatory about your bisexuality.

1045
01:11:19,424 --> 01:11:20,721
it's ok.

1046
01:11:23,428 --> 01:11:26,329
I gotta go see my mom in a couple of minutes cause there's something.

1047
01:11:26,431 --> 01:11:28,490
this guy is in a piece of kwack.

1048
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,397
just five minutes.

1049
01:11:33,772 --> 01:11:36,138
i feel bad about everything, i do.

1050
01:11:36,441 --> 01:11:39,342
i am sorry  i reacted the way i did in there.

1051
01:11:40,345 --> 01:11:43,280
i just, words are not serving me at all.

1052
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:45,282
i think that language is always lies.

1053
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:47,852
that is why i like playing the piano, because

1054
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:50,184
there is no words.

1055
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,858
what is your point, what do you wanna do?

1056
01:11:54,226 --> 01:11:57,286
i dont know, i am very reluctant to say goodbye.

1057
01:11:57,396 --> 01:12:00,263
i think there's something exceptional 

1058
01:12:00,899 --> 01:12:04,300
to accomplish, not to ditch our relationship right now?

1059
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:07,372
even if i think that

1060
01:12:07,739 --> 01:12:10,299
i think the cycle would still continue.

1061
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:12,468
Finally it will just come down to chemistry.

1062
01:12:12,577 --> 01:12:15,307
- Hormones.
- the only thing to do.

1063
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:17,507
when you're overcome with overwhelming desire

1064
01:12:17,616 --> 01:12:19,311
- just submit to it

1065
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:27,324
even if it is admitted to?

1066
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:29,894
- did i do that?
- What?

1067
01:12:30,362 --> 01:12:32,660
like you want me to say:
"Hi, how is your day?".

1068
01:12:32,764 --> 01:12:34,891
"it was great, i fucked this guy, how was yours?".

1069
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:38,630
what are you saying? that after everything it is better to lie?

1070
01:12:40,205 --> 01:12:43,197
I am just saying that maybe we're just not capable of monogamy.

1071
01:12:43,308 --> 01:12:47,267
maybe for some people it's like nature,
maybe we're just

1072
01:12:47,379 --> 01:12:48,846
Fucked up?

1073
01:12:49,214 --> 01:12:52,445
Maybe monogamy violates some part of our being

1074
01:12:52,551 --> 01:12:56,783
desire makes us feel alive. we need to feel desired.

1075
01:12:56,888 --> 01:12:59,356
And to say no is like automutilation.

1076
01:13:00,225 --> 01:13:03,285
some people are so desperate they need to feel like they are not alone

1077
01:13:03,395 --> 01:13:06,296
so they pretend like they can love one person exclusively.

1078
01:13:06,398 --> 01:13:09,959
- they being you and I ?
- would you argue with that?

1079
01:13:10,068 --> 01:13:12,298
I'd like to,
but i dont think i can make a valid argument.

1080
01:13:12,404 --> 01:13:16,306
i think that regardless of whether or not you can trust me

1081
01:13:16,408 --> 01:13:19,377
or i can trust you, when i am not with you and we trust ourselves

1082
01:13:20,412 --> 01:13:22,505
it doesnt mean that we just can right now.

1083
01:13:22,614 --> 01:13:25,310
i think we should continue and see what happens.

1084
01:13:29,387 --> 01:13:31,480
I gotta go see my mom. I'll be right back

1085
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:34,058
don't leave, okay?

1086
01:13:53,378 --> 01:13:54,345
I am gonna go.

1087
01:13:57,349 --> 01:13:58,680
here's my number.

1088
01:14:00,385 --> 01:14:03,354
if you ever have the beer, i'll always have the time.

1089
01:14:03,889 --> 01:14:05,686
and i dont mean just sexually.

1090
01:14:06,391 --> 01:14:08,518
not just sexually anyway.

1091
01:15:21,399 --> 01:15:24,800
Hi. Manhattan.

1092
01:15:24,903 --> 01:15:26,370
Frank E. Campbell.

1093
01:15:28,373 --> 01:15:29,362
it is a business.

1094
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:34,378
Camp... the letter E.

1095
01:15:34,913 --> 01:15:39,145
it's  Campbell,
C-A-M-P-B-E-L-L.

1096
01:15:40,352 --> 01:15:41,944
it's a funeral home.

1097
01:16:13,385 --> 01:16:15,353
Hi, i am calling

1098
01:16:35,407 --> 01:16:36,305
Hi

1099
01:16:36,408 --> 01:16:37,306
Hello.

1100
01:16:44,349 --> 01:16:48,308
yeah, i am calling to make funeral arrangements

1101
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:51,254
for my friends mother.

1102
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:53,316
Dorothy Allan.

1103
01:16:55,293 --> 01:16:56,817
okay, we'll be there then.

1104
01:17:55,687 --> 01:17:57,314
are you okay?

1105
01:18:15,373 --> 01:18:16,840
we should go.

1106
01:18:26,384 --> 01:18:27,851
i am gonna get my coat.
