00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:14,576
<i>Vehicle in the left lane
causing congestion, so...</i>

2
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:16,644
<i>avoid this route.</i>

3
00:01:16,678 --> 00:01:18,613
<i>Thank you for the morning
traffic update, John.</i>

4
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:19,714
<i>You know, Fred, I always</i>

5
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,583
<i>get this strange feeling</i>

6
00:01:21,616 --> 00:01:22,850
<i>when I'm stuck in traffic.</i>

7
00:01:22,884 --> 00:01:25,653
<i>There I am, mere feet
away from other people</i>

8
00:01:25,687 --> 00:01:27,755
<i>packed together on
a strip of asphalt.</i>

9
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:30,157
<i>Yet we find ourselves
passing by each other</i>

10
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,193
<i>from the loneliness of
our respective tin cans.</i>

11
00:01:35,597 --> 00:01:37,464
<i>You got the supply chain, right?</i>

12
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,333
<i>Transportation of goods being...</i>

13
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:42,202
<i>Your goal is to meet your
high-value objectives,</i>

14
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:44,772
<i>ensure the supplier feels
good about the deal.</i>

15
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:51,144
<i>Let's round off the hour
and welcome the rising sun</i>

16
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:53,347
<i>with a song that I'm
sure you'll remember.</i>

17
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:14,301
<i>♪ I got my looks from
my mama and dad ♪</i>

18
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,390
<i>How is your morning, drivers?</i>

19
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,426
<i>All good in Albany,
ladies, headin' south.</i>

20
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,629
<i>Well, I pulled an
all-nighter out here,</i>

21
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:16,229
<i>unloading in Sacramento.</i>

22
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:17,397
<i>Mornin' over there yet?</i>

23
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:19,366
<i>No, it's all dark here.</i>

24
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,702
<i>Can't wait to head back East</i>

25
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:23,538
<i>as soon as I get her emptied
out and loaded back up.</i>

26
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:26,007
<i>Well, I got a great
view up in the Rockies,</i>

27
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,843
<i>but the truth is I'm just scared
shitless of the trip down.</i>

28
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:32,279
<i>Break on the engine, sweetie.</i>

29
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,781
<i>Jake break, driver.</i>

30
00:03:33,815 --> 00:03:37,384
<i>How about you, Sally? Hey,</i>
chiquita, <i>you still there?</i>

31
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:41,622
Yeah, still here. I got
a beautiful day here.

32
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:43,758
Heading east to 61.

33
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,660
<i>Good to have you back, chica.</i>

34
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:49,262
<i>Oh, shut up, Pattie. She's
Canadian, not Mexican.</i>

35
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,632
<i>She talks weird.
That's all I know.</i>

36
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:55,770
Okay, you're giving me
shit, you motherfuckers.

37
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:58,606
<i>Oh, yeah. You got it.</i>

38
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,608
<i>You pickin' up
your brother today?</i>

39
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:03,511
<i>No, Thursday. Come on, Dolly.</i>

40
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:05,747
<i>She ain't been talking about
anything else for weeks.</i>

41
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,648
<i>Do he talk weird
like you, Sally?</i>

42
00:04:07,682 --> 00:04:10,350
Well, Dolly, fuck you very much.

43
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:13,888
<i>Shut it. You know he came down
here when he was real little.</i>

44
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,723
<i>Sally came later.</i>

45
00:04:15,757 --> 00:04:17,792
<i>Yeah, right. That's
what fucked her up.</i>

46
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:19,927
<i>No, that's what fucked him up.</i>

47
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:23,030
Fuck you, too. Okay,
drivers. Gotta go.

48
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:25,600
<i>Bye now. Be safe. Safe.</i>

49
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:27,434
- <i>Safe.</i>
- Safe.

50
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,700
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- I'm here to visit.

51
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:06,541
Thank you.

52
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:19,554
I missed you so much.

53
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:21,421
Take your seats, please.

54
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:26,527
I have not been this
excited to see you

55
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:28,763
since you came down
from Quebec with Mom.

56
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:40,775
Pick you up Thursday?

57
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:43,110
You better.

58
00:05:43,144 --> 00:05:44,946
You got the "dress-out"
in the mail, right?

59
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:45,980
Yeah.

60
00:05:48,783 --> 00:05:52,053
It's just so weird
because, uh...

61
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:54,522
you know, you cope
while you're in here

62
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:57,390
and... and when
it's almost over,

63
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:59,126
then you just can't
take it anymore.

64
00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:03,740
It's kinda like when you
have to go to the bathroom...

65
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:06,834
You're almost there,
and the door is locked.

66
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:08,035
Sit back, please.

67
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:10,571
It's her.

68
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:16,611
Well, I know what I want.

69
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:21,616
I want you to make me
that... tart tartu.

70
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:23,751
I want you to make a tart tartu.

71
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:26,453
What was it? What was it?

72
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:27,855
What's that stuff Mom made?

73
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:29,624
- Tarte Tatin.
- Tarte Tatin.

74
00:06:29,657 --> 00:06:31,559
- Apple tart.
- I love it.

75
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:56,449
Two minutes.

76
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:58,719
Thursday.

77
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:08,129
What? Please, you said
that was the last time.

78
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:13,100
They asked for one more.

79
00:07:13,134 --> 00:07:15,136
I know, I know, I know. I
gotta get on the outside.

80
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:16,671
You gotta get me on
the outside. Okay?

81
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:18,471
Just one more time.

82
00:07:18,506 --> 00:07:20,841
- So, last package, I promise.
- Okay.

83
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,177
All right? We ain't
bad. We ain't bad.

84
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,845
Listen, listen, listen.

85
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,479
All visitors must exit now.

86
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:27,958
They're gonna fucking kill
me. Sis, you gotta get me

87
00:07:27,982 --> 00:07:29,784
- out of here, okay?
- Okay, yeah, yeah.

88
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,061
Where's the package?

89
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,899
What the fuck?

90
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:54,168
You'll take her there.
Across the state line.

91
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,579
Paul's the guy who's
gonna meet you.

92
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:57,905
Come on, sweetie.

93
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:01,609
Yep.

94
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,214
No way. No fucking way.

95
00:09:07,248 --> 00:09:10,951
- Excuse me?
- You don't understand. I don't take people.

96
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:16,190
Hey! I was told I
could trust you.

97
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,592
No way I can promise what'll
happen to your brother

98
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:21,262
if you don't take the girl
where she fucking needs to go!

99
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:04,004
What's your name?

100
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,208
We're not gonna talk.

101
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,415
Paul?

102
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:30,985
Yep.

103
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,922
Come on, lady. It's paid fo...

104
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,366
No! Get off of me!

105
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:51,939
Fuck! Fuck! Get down!

106
00:13:41,623 --> 00:13:43,591
Fuck!

107
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,226
Shut up!

108
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:53,967
Northbound... can I
get a radio check?

109
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:56,170
Any bears at the weigh station?

110
00:13:57,572 --> 00:13:59,507
Any bears at the weigh...

111
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:02,343
The fucking fuse!

112
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:05,312
- Get down! Get down!
- No!

113
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:11,485
They can search the
entire truck. Get down!

114
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,354
No! Stop!

115
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,325
Police! Police!

116
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:20,027
Is that what you want?

117
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,348
All right, kids,
run to the bathroom.

118
00:16:22,684 --> 00:16:24,218
We gotta get you in the back.

119
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:26,453
Come on. Come on.

120
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:29,089
Come on.

121
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:32,459
Stop!

122
00:16:35,797 --> 00:16:38,165
- No! No!
- Come on!

123
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,702
Shh.

124
00:16:40,735 --> 00:16:43,638
- Let's go, guys.
- Come on. Hurry...

125
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:49,276
You're gonna miss
Nia's birthday.

126
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:58,780
- Mornin'.
- Mornin'.

127
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,119
- In, in, in, in.
- Quick, quick.

128
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:10,390
Seatbelts.

129
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:41,154
- Dennis?
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

130
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:43,457
<i>Took some time to get a
burner phone. You okay?</i>

131
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,460
- It was a girl, Dennis.
<i>- What do you mean?</i>

132
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:50,565
Young. Ten, 12 maybe.

133
00:18:50,598 --> 00:18:52,342
<i>Wait, what, what? What
are you talking about?</i>

134
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:54,401
The fucking package was a girl.

135
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:00,240
<i>What? Oh, fuck.
What did you do?</i>

136
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:03,210
She shot the guy.

137
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:04,779
With your shotgun.

138
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:08,683
<i>Oh, my God. Is he dead?</i>

139
00:19:09,717 --> 00:19:11,653
I don't know. I think so. I...

140
00:19:11,686 --> 00:19:15,890
<i>Oh, we're so fucked.
What are we gonna do?</i>

141
00:19:15,923 --> 00:19:18,492
<i>- What-what are you hauling?</i>
- Unloading in Oxford.

142
00:19:18,526 --> 00:19:20,494
Got another taking me
to Jackson. That's it.

143
00:19:20,528 --> 00:19:21,896
<i>Okay, all right,
you just listen.</i>

144
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:23,698
<i>Just seem... Just seem
regular, you know.</i>

145
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:25,833
<i>Just finish whatever
bookings you got.</i>

146
00:19:25,867 --> 00:19:27,902
Are you gonna be okay?

147
00:19:27,935 --> 00:19:29,771
<i>You're in danger, sis.</i>

148
00:19:29,804 --> 00:19:32,573
<i>These guys have eyes all
over the fucking state.</i>

149
00:19:33,975 --> 00:19:36,644
And the girl... where
do I drop the girl?

150
00:19:36,678 --> 00:19:38,756
<i>I don't know, I don't know. You just
gotta take her... take her with you.</i>

151
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,548
- What?
- <i>I-I don't know.</i>

152
00:19:40,581 --> 00:19:43,751
No! No way she can
stay in my truck.

153
00:19:43,785 --> 00:19:45,853
<i>She's the only thing
keepin' us safe.</i>

154
00:20:43,477 --> 00:20:47,380
Hey, beautiful. Fuck
off! Motherfucker!

155
00:22:37,124 --> 00:22:38,926
He just...

156
00:22:39,961 --> 00:22:41,996
He exploded.

157
00:23:43,557 --> 00:23:45,192
This is your guy, right?

158
00:23:45,226 --> 00:23:49,830
Fuck. Yeah, I took him
down a half year ago

159
00:23:49,864 --> 00:23:53,034
when we busted the
MacDougal traffic ring.

160
00:23:53,067 --> 00:23:57,004
Low level sergeant,
oversaw one of the routes.

161
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,642
- He's out already?
- Out on bond.

162
00:24:03,044 --> 00:24:05,680
Pictures of those girls
still haunt the web.

163
00:24:07,915 --> 00:24:10,151
Shell casings? Prints?

164
00:24:10,184 --> 00:24:12,520
Fingerprints only
from the victim.

165
00:24:13,854 --> 00:24:16,123
They ended him with a slug.

166
00:24:17,858 --> 00:24:20,094
- Nasty choice for a hit job.
- Hmm.

167
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:22,129
Other slug's in that
tree over there.

168
00:24:23,564 --> 00:24:26,100
And you're retired
for how long now?

169
00:24:28,002 --> 00:24:30,137
Consultant Gerick
at your service.

170
00:24:30,171 --> 00:24:34,608
So, who's your new assistant?

171
00:24:34,642 --> 00:24:36,811
Ah, desk rat from legal.

172
00:24:36,844 --> 00:24:40,681
Wants field experience.
Went to Yale.

173
00:24:40,715 --> 00:24:42,917
I heard they have a very
good English department.

174
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,552
Mm.

175
00:24:47,221 --> 00:24:48,656
Strange.

176
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:51,292
Paul came here

177
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:53,594
to pick up a girl

178
00:24:53,627 --> 00:24:56,297
who'd been transported
across the state line.

179
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,532
His normal routine.
But then...

180
00:25:00,101 --> 00:25:02,103
Why?

181
00:25:02,136 --> 00:25:04,638
It's what we're
trying to figure out.

182
00:25:04,672 --> 00:25:07,675
We got wider and deeper tracks
from the second vehicle.

183
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:08,976
It's probably a truck.

184
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:13,080
Yeah. Refrigerated
trailer or dry van.

185
00:25:13,114 --> 00:25:15,316
No tarp.

186
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:19,620
All right, well, start by alerting
the weigh stations, Finley.

187
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:22,590
Excuse me, Gerick. Just,
please, call me by my last name.

188
00:25:22,623 --> 00:25:25,059
- All right, Yale.
- Sterling.

189
00:25:25,092 --> 00:25:27,661
You gonna make those calls or
you gonna write a poem about it?

190
00:25:29,063 --> 00:25:31,198
I'll make the calls. Just,
please, call me Sterling.

191
00:25:31,232 --> 00:25:32,767
Yeah.

192
00:25:55,823 --> 00:25:58,192
Never seen you so
lazy, Ms. Sally.

193
00:25:58,225 --> 00:25:59,960
Sorry, Frank, got a bad knee.

194
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:03,264
You got a lover in there, huh?

195
00:26:03,297 --> 00:26:05,166
Always.

196
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:09,737
Uh-huh. Well, you ready to roll.

197
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:06,026
Take these out to the car.

198
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,428
Whoa.

199
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:10,097
- Come on, come on.
- Fine.

200
00:27:10,131 --> 00:27:11,298
All right.

201
00:27:11,332 --> 00:27:13,334
Hey, so, State Police

202
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:15,045
are doing us a favor
on the weigh stations,

203
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:16,904
and we got a match on
the muddy tire tracks

204
00:27:16,937 --> 00:27:18,348
headed onto the south
highway entrance.

205
00:27:18,372 --> 00:27:19,907
So Mississippi, not Tennessee.

206
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,009
- And...
- Here.

207
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:24,445
Yeah, Gerick, I'm
not your assistant.

208
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:27,381
This is my case, and I appreciate
having you on as a consultant,

209
00:27:27,414 --> 00:27:29,426
but right now, we just need
you to sign this, and then...

210
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,418
We start with files
from last year.

211
00:27:31,452 --> 00:27:34,255
I'll bet he was whacked by
one of his little buddies.

212
00:27:34,288 --> 00:27:37,258
We take a look at
all known associates.

213
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:40,227
Find out which one might've
had a beef with Paul.

214
00:27:40,261 --> 00:27:42,229
And we're looking
for a girl. One.

215
00:27:42,263 --> 00:27:44,465
He always bought
'em one at a time.

216
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:47,201
Yeah, so we just need you to sign
this report for headquarters.

217
00:27:47,234 --> 00:27:50,004
No time for bureaucracy, Yale.

218
00:27:50,037 --> 00:27:53,307
I think you're taking this
a bit too personally, sir.

219
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,843
- Excuse me?
- I think you heard me.

220
00:27:59,413 --> 00:28:01,148
All right. We're taking my car.

221
00:28:01,182 --> 00:28:04,385
And let me know where we're
at with that cell phone.

222
00:28:10,124 --> 00:28:11,992
Okay, so we did
crack Paul's phone.

223
00:28:12,026 --> 00:28:14,228
It wasn't easy. With recent
numbers already being dead,

224
00:28:14,261 --> 00:28:16,106
we couldn't trace it, and
no registered address.

225
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,774
But he did pay for the phone
bill with a credit card

226
00:28:17,798 --> 00:28:20,334
that also paid the
utilities at an address.

227
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:22,937
Good lung capacity there, Yale.

228
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,005
What is that, Ivy
League swim team?

229
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,941
I put in a request
for a warrant.

230
00:28:26,974 --> 00:28:28,976
- Ah, we're not waiting for that.
- Gerick.

231
00:28:32,046 --> 00:28:33,247
Something's not right.

232
00:28:34,848 --> 00:28:36,518
Paul should've called by now.

233
00:28:50,565 --> 00:28:51,999
Go back to your room!

234
00:29:08,182 --> 00:29:10,451
Be smart. Stay in the back.

235
00:29:11,586 --> 00:29:13,521
Don't let anybody see you, okay?

236
00:30:03,337 --> 00:30:06,574
Hey! Hey, you! Hey!

237
00:30:12,913 --> 00:30:14,582
Who's that girl?

238
00:30:14,616 --> 00:30:17,017
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Goddamnit!

239
00:30:17,051 --> 00:30:20,321
Does anyone care that
I am working next door?

240
00:30:28,596 --> 00:30:30,464
All right.

241
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:37,404
Okay. Let's get goin'.

242
00:30:46,614 --> 00:30:48,415
I always move the truck

243
00:30:48,449 --> 00:30:51,485
after being seen outside
of this truck stop.

244
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:54,154
Worst reputation on the road.

245
00:30:57,625 --> 00:31:00,861
Hmm. My brother. He's good.

246
00:31:01,962 --> 00:31:04,532
Champ. He'll help.

247
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:21,382
You got a brother?

248
00:31:23,317 --> 00:31:24,552
Sisters?

249
00:31:32,092 --> 00:31:34,928
Guess you don't have no
mom or dad either, huh?

250
00:31:34,962 --> 00:31:37,231
What are you? Baby Jesus?

251
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,934
What's your name?

252
00:31:43,638 --> 00:31:44,938
Leila.

253
00:31:44,972 --> 00:31:46,039
Leila.

254
00:31:48,743 --> 00:31:50,578
<i>And that was the farmer
who found the body</i>

255
00:31:50,612 --> 00:31:53,480
<i>- on a muddy back road off 25.</i>
- Mm-hm. I see it.

256
00:31:53,515 --> 00:31:55,650
<i>- Less than a mile north of the state border.
- </i> Yeah.

257
00:31:55,683 --> 00:31:58,553
<i>A brutal killing that's
hard to grapple with.</i>

258
00:31:58,586 --> 00:32:01,589
<i>- How did it happen and why?</i>
- That little girl's gonna tell on us.

259
00:32:01,623 --> 00:32:04,291
No one's gonna tell on nobody.

260
00:32:04,324 --> 00:32:07,995
<i>The once quiet community is coming
to terms with what's happened</i>

261
00:32:08,028 --> 00:32:11,131
<i>as the motive remains
unclear in the Mud Murder.</i>

262
00:32:11,165 --> 00:32:14,468
<i>What would warrant such a
violent end to a person's life?</i>

263
00:32:14,501 --> 00:32:16,303
<i>Law enforcement is questioning</i>

264
00:32:16,336 --> 00:32:18,439
<i>- the use of slugs...</i>
- Fuck me. Who leaked?

265
00:32:18,472 --> 00:32:20,340
<i>- A particularly damaging bullet.
- </i> Not me.

266
00:32:20,374 --> 00:32:22,476
<i>It's a most unusual
find at the crime scene.</i>

267
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:26,280
Some lonesome cowboy wanting
his 15 minutes of fame.

268
00:32:26,313 --> 00:32:27,591
<i>Police are looking
into the manner.</i>

269
00:32:27,615 --> 00:32:29,249
<i>And this, for now,
is all we know</i>

270
00:32:29,283 --> 00:32:30,718
<i>about the innocent victim.</i>

271
00:32:30,752 --> 00:32:32,554
Innocent, my ass.

272
00:32:32,587 --> 00:32:34,689
<i>As the investigation proceeds,</i>

273
00:32:34,722 --> 00:32:36,624
<i>no stone will be left unturned.</i>

274
00:32:36,658 --> 00:32:38,526
You can go to the police,

275
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,395
tell 'em what he
would've done to you.

276
00:32:43,063 --> 00:32:45,098
That it was self-defense.

277
00:32:47,201 --> 00:32:48,368
Hmm?

278
00:32:48,402 --> 00:32:50,605
<i>Is where the crime took place,</i>

279
00:32:50,638 --> 00:32:52,607
<i>spreading fear on what...</i>

280
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,776
Just don't bite and
kick 'em, all right?

281
00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:58,011
<i>Still hiding in the woods.</i>

282
00:32:58,045 --> 00:32:59,379
<i>It's not yet confirmed...</i>

283
00:32:59,413 --> 00:33:02,382
I don't like the police.

284
00:33:02,416 --> 00:33:06,320
<i>But it is confirmed that the
manhunt covers both states.</i>

285
00:33:18,733 --> 00:33:22,336
You crying 'cause you're scared, or you
crying 'cause that piece of shit is dead?

286
00:33:26,206 --> 00:33:28,442
You know, Leila, you
might have shot him,

287
00:33:28,475 --> 00:33:30,545
but I left him there to die.

288
00:33:33,113 --> 00:33:36,016
We're in this together.

289
00:33:46,828 --> 00:33:49,396
Oh, we can't cross state lines.

290
00:33:49,429 --> 00:33:51,633
It's too risky with
the weigh stations.

291
00:33:54,602 --> 00:33:56,604
Mm-mm.

292
00:33:56,638 --> 00:33:59,574
I'll get us to a place
where we can't be found.

293
00:33:59,607 --> 00:34:03,477
We'll wait there till
my brother has a plan.

294
00:34:23,263 --> 00:34:26,133
Yes, Patterson,
yes. I know, I know.

295
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:29,136
You have to see the girl in
order for me to get the warrant,

296
00:34:29,169 --> 00:34:32,139
even if I need the warrant
to get the fucking girl!

297
00:34:35,142 --> 00:34:36,844
You know, we might
still be able to get it.

298
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:39,681
I'm afraid the idiots at
legal disagree with you, Yale.

299
00:34:39,714 --> 00:34:41,783
All right, well, I used
to work there, so...

300
00:34:41,816 --> 00:34:45,319
I know that. You're the idiot
who refused to issue the warrant

301
00:34:45,352 --> 00:34:48,422
that would've kept Paul
from getting out on bond!

302
00:35:29,196 --> 00:35:32,734
Okay. My buddy caught a
glimpse of a young girl

303
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:35,570
poking her head out of a
blue Peterbilt yesterday.

304
00:35:35,603 --> 00:35:38,539
Said the truck was
headed south on 49.

305
00:35:38,573 --> 00:35:40,893
Called some of our friends down
there to be on the lookout.

306
00:35:48,448 --> 00:35:49,851
<i>Can't hate 'em much.</i>

307
00:35:49,884 --> 00:35:52,219
<i>Give me extra time off
when I got my daughter.</i>

308
00:35:52,252 --> 00:35:54,388
<i>'Cause we all know
34 hours ain't much.</i>

309
00:35:54,421 --> 00:35:56,557
<i>Yeah, I just sleep
and fuck through 'em.</i>

310
00:35:56,591 --> 00:35:58,492
<i>Hey, Sally.</i>

311
00:35:58,526 --> 00:36:00,528
<i>Headin' to Louisville
anytime soon?</i>

312
00:36:00,561 --> 00:36:02,630
Nope, not any time soon.

313
00:36:02,664 --> 00:36:04,932
<i>Yeah, can't go far from Utica.</i>

314
00:36:04,966 --> 00:36:07,568
- That's right.
<i>- No shame in that.</i>

315
00:36:07,602 --> 00:36:10,638
<i>I only ran local 'round New York
when my beau was at Sing Sing.</i>

316
00:36:10,672 --> 00:36:13,641
<i>- It's her brother, Dolly.
- Beau, brother.</i>

317
00:36:13,675 --> 00:36:17,512
<i>Only difference is one's gonna
cheat on ya and not the other.</i>

318
00:36:18,846 --> 00:36:22,282
- Very funny.
<i>- Come on, Sal.</i>

319
00:36:22,315 --> 00:36:25,553
<i>What's going on with the
two-syllable responses?</i>

320
00:36:25,586 --> 00:36:27,989
Uh, sorry, Pattie, been
having a rough time.

321
00:36:28,022 --> 00:36:29,624
<i>Wanna tell us about it?</i>

322
00:36:29,657 --> 00:36:31,659
<i>I got 500 miles
of windshield time</i>

323
00:36:31,693 --> 00:36:33,293
<i>and nothin' to do.</i>

324
00:36:33,326 --> 00:36:35,429
<i>It's okay to ask
for help, Sally,</i>

325
00:36:35,462 --> 00:36:37,799
<i>we're just a phone call away.</i>

326
00:36:37,832 --> 00:36:41,936
Maybe later. All right,
ladies, drive safe.

327
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:43,504
<i>- Safe.
- Safe.</i>

328
00:36:43,538 --> 00:36:44,639
<i>Safe.</i>

329
00:37:51,606 --> 00:37:53,007
Florida is a dump.

330
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,921
I don't care if it's a dump when
you can go wherever you want.

331
00:37:57,945 --> 00:38:00,815
Where do you
wanna go? Walmart?

332
00:38:02,482 --> 00:38:04,417
No. The ocean.

333
00:38:04,852 --> 00:38:06,020
Oh.

334
00:38:08,589 --> 00:38:10,625
'Cause the ocean
goes everywhere.

335
00:38:24,371 --> 00:38:26,040
Hey, stop that! Stop that!

336
00:38:26,073 --> 00:38:30,511
- That's dangerous.
It's dangerous.

337
00:38:30,545 --> 00:38:32,847
Who the fuck cares?
It feels good.

338
00:39:17,424 --> 00:39:20,528
The neighbor said she saw girls
walking in and out of the house.

339
00:39:20,561 --> 00:39:23,931
"Maybe should've called someone," she
says, but doesn't wanna get involved.

340
00:39:23,965 --> 00:39:26,567
- Hm.
- I can't believe people are like this.

341
00:39:26,601 --> 00:39:30,738
Well, write a poem about it.

342
00:39:30,771 --> 00:39:32,506
Isn't that what you do at Yale?

343
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:35,109
No. Sometimes we write essays.

344
00:39:35,142 --> 00:39:38,012
Well, get her statement.

345
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:39,046
On it.

346
00:39:39,647 --> 00:39:40,915
Ma'am!

347
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:43,885
One second.

348
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,925
All right, Patterson.
We got what you need.

349
00:39:52,627 --> 00:39:55,062
<i>I'm worried about you, sis.</i>

350
00:39:55,096 --> 00:39:56,664
<i>You should find a place to hide.</i>

351
00:39:56,697 --> 00:39:58,633
<i>One of the... One of
those big truck stops.</i>

352
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:01,802
- I know a place we can hide.
<i>- Okay, good.</i>

353
00:40:01,836 --> 00:40:03,547
<i>You don't think you've
been spotted yet, right?</i>

354
00:40:03,571 --> 00:40:05,606
- No.
<i>- Good. Good.</i>

355
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,440
- No.
- <i>All right. All right.</i>

356
00:40:07,474 --> 00:40:09,110
<i>So-so, you'll hide overnight</i>

357
00:40:09,143 --> 00:40:11,913
<i>and then you make your
way to Arkansas tomorrow.</i>

358
00:40:11,946 --> 00:40:14,181
- Arkansas?
<i>- You'll be safer there.</i>

359
00:40:14,215 --> 00:40:16,183
But I'm pickin' you
up in Utica tomorrow.

360
00:40:16,217 --> 00:40:19,486
<i>No, you can't do that. Not
with the load you're carrying.</i>

361
00:40:20,788 --> 00:40:22,590
But I wanna be there
when you get out.

362
00:40:22,623 --> 00:40:23,824
<i>I know, I know.</i>

363
00:40:23,858 --> 00:40:26,193
<i>That was the plan, but
it's not safe, sis.</i>

364
00:40:26,227 --> 00:40:28,229
<i>These guys aren't
fucking around.</i>

365
00:40:28,262 --> 00:40:31,732
Okay. Okay, so what do I do?

366
00:40:33,034 --> 00:40:35,169
Get across the
border and meet you?

367
00:40:35,202 --> 00:40:37,104
Where?

368
00:40:37,138 --> 00:40:39,540
<i>At home.</i>

369
00:40:39,573 --> 00:40:41,509
- Home?
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

370
00:40:41,542 --> 00:40:44,545
I'm not going back home, Dennis.

371
00:40:44,578 --> 00:40:46,714
I haven't been there
since I was 15, I...

372
00:40:46,747 --> 00:40:48,749
I can't go back.

373
00:40:48,783 --> 00:40:50,818
<i>Dad's dead.</i>

374
00:40:50,851 --> 00:40:52,987
I know, I paid for
his fucking casket.

375
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:57,158
- I'm not going.
<i>- It's the only safe place I know, I'm sorry.</i>

376
00:40:57,191 --> 00:40:59,226
<i>Shit, someone...
Someone's coming.</i>

377
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,995
<i>I-I gotta go.</i>

378
00:41:19,847 --> 00:41:21,549
We found a dog in the basement.

379
00:41:21,582 --> 00:41:23,617
We need a few minutes
to tranquilize it.

380
00:41:23,651 --> 00:41:25,286
Okay.

381
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:26,754
Saunders?

382
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:44,839
Neighbors say they saw the girls
walking around the neighborhood.

383
00:41:47,975 --> 00:41:49,076
I don't understand.

384
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:52,780
Why didn't they...
call the police?

385
00:41:52,813 --> 00:41:55,983
Ask for help? Something.

386
00:41:56,017 --> 00:42:00,087
These kids have been fucked over by the
system since the day they were born.

387
00:42:01,722 --> 00:42:03,190
They don't call the police.

388
00:42:04,692 --> 00:42:06,994
Nobody gives a shit
and they know it.

389
00:42:08,996 --> 00:42:13,167
They also know that if they
step out of line what happens.

390
00:42:14,301 --> 00:42:16,303
That's what the basement is for.

391
00:42:35,156 --> 00:42:38,359
- A kid had been in this cage.
- What?

392
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:42,196
A kid had been in this
cage. Bolted to the wall.

393
00:42:43,831 --> 00:42:46,033
Dog was running loose.

394
00:42:46,067 --> 00:42:47,334
From the looks of the dog,

395
00:42:47,368 --> 00:42:49,303
it had been trained
to be aggressive.

396
00:42:49,336 --> 00:42:51,705
Traces of blood on the bolts.

397
00:42:53,374 --> 00:42:56,811
Looks like someone tried
to claw their way out.

398
00:42:56,844 --> 00:42:58,879
Fresh. Couple of days.

399
00:42:58,913 --> 00:43:00,848
We just missed them.

400
00:43:00,881 --> 00:43:02,316
Clothes in the cage.

401
00:43:02,349 --> 00:43:04,185
Pant size, dress size.

402
00:43:04,218 --> 00:43:07,254
She's probably about
five feet. Young.

403
00:43:07,288 --> 00:43:09,890
And she found a
pencil to doodle with.

404
00:43:46,694 --> 00:43:48,162
You know this place?

405
00:44:04,378 --> 00:44:06,280
This truck stop's so big...

406
00:44:08,048 --> 00:44:10,251
even the pimps don't
know their way around.

407
00:44:10,284 --> 00:44:12,386
We can hide here till tomorrow.

408
00:44:25,032 --> 00:44:26,200
Okay.

409
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:30,771
Let's go over the ground rules.

410
00:44:35,743 --> 00:44:38,679
Hair spray, AKA pepper spray.

411
00:44:40,147 --> 00:44:41,182
Here.

412
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:46,187
Man's coat stays on
the driver's seat.

413
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,721
Makes them think
a guy lives here.

414
00:44:48,889 --> 00:44:53,360
At night, curtains
closed, lights off.

415
00:44:53,394 --> 00:44:56,063
Lights on is an
invitation. Right?

416
00:44:56,096 --> 00:44:58,866
Someone knocks, we don't open.

417
00:44:58,899 --> 00:45:01,001
Doors locked. Windows up.

418
00:45:01,035 --> 00:45:04,738
Seatbelt wrapped
through the door handle

419
00:45:04,772 --> 00:45:07,841
and fastened when
we're sleepin'.

420
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:12,846
You sleep up top. I'm
on the bottom. Got it?

421
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,049
- Got it.
- I do the shoppin'.

422
00:45:15,082 --> 00:45:17,384
But you do the
dishes. You stay here.

423
00:45:17,418 --> 00:45:19,920
Don't let nobody see you, okay?

424
00:45:19,954 --> 00:45:21,722
- All right.
- That's it.

425
00:45:26,293 --> 00:45:27,895
But I need to go to the store.

426
00:45:27,928 --> 00:45:29,863
Uh, didn't you hear what I said?

427
00:45:29,897 --> 00:45:31,999
Your underwear is huge on me.

428
00:45:32,032 --> 00:45:34,735
Would you prefer me to walk around
with 'em gathered in my ass?

429
00:45:41,275 --> 00:45:42,409
This it?

430
00:45:42,443 --> 00:45:44,912
It's for my niece.

431
00:45:44,945 --> 00:45:47,314
Well, how do you like that?

432
00:45:47,348 --> 00:45:50,818
I see you more than
I see my own family,

433
00:45:50,851 --> 00:45:53,420
and I didn't even
know you had a niece.

434
00:46:02,963 --> 00:46:08,202
Oh, come on, Patterson, don't give me this
shit about priority of resources, man.

435
00:46:08,235 --> 00:46:12,072
This is a fucking
priority. Fuck!

436
00:46:21,616 --> 00:46:23,317
Fuck!

437
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:24,785
- Yeah.
- Fuck!

438
00:46:27,388 --> 00:46:30,924
You've been at this,
what, 30, 40 years?

439
00:46:31,925 --> 00:46:33,027
Fifty.

440
00:46:35,195 --> 00:46:36,930
Still gets you riled up, huh?

441
00:46:37,931 --> 00:46:39,867
How the hell can it not?

442
00:46:45,005 --> 00:46:46,440
Why don't they run?

443
00:46:48,543 --> 00:46:52,279
You know? Because I would.

444
00:46:52,313 --> 00:46:54,348
Anything to get away
from that hellhole.

445
00:46:54,381 --> 00:46:58,485
Fuck no. You... You'd
be locked in a basement.

446
00:47:01,288 --> 00:47:05,025
No, you wouldn't
run. You'd stay.

447
00:47:06,327 --> 00:47:10,598
Try to play the game. Survive.

448
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,411
What the fuck would
you live on out there?

449
00:47:14,435 --> 00:47:16,470
Grass? Clover?

450
00:47:17,971 --> 00:47:19,073
Best case scenario,

451
00:47:19,106 --> 00:47:21,576
you're found and brought
right back into the system.

452
00:47:21,609 --> 00:47:23,444
Then you'd run again.

453
00:47:28,315 --> 00:47:29,584
Sorry.

454
00:47:32,654 --> 00:47:35,022
Most of these kids
are held captive

455
00:47:35,055 --> 00:47:38,125
just a few miles from
where they grew up.

456
00:47:38,158 --> 00:47:40,595
In their minds they
got nowhere to go.

457
00:47:43,297 --> 00:47:45,899
And for a lot of
'em, that's true.

458
00:47:50,237 --> 00:47:51,606
Same hair as in the basement.

459
00:47:53,508 --> 00:47:54,875
Thank you.

460
00:48:16,564 --> 00:48:18,666
Shouldn't we get...
Shouldn't we get rid of that?

461
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:23,137
Not an option. My mom gave it
to my brother before she died.

462
00:48:24,204 --> 00:48:26,974
They find this...

463
00:48:27,007 --> 00:48:28,510
they've found us anyway.

464
00:48:31,546 --> 00:48:33,447
You fire it, you clean it.

465
00:48:48,462 --> 00:48:50,397
I see his eyes all the time.

466
00:48:52,534 --> 00:48:55,035
You kill someone 'cause
you wanna be free,

467
00:48:56,036 --> 00:48:57,705
but then he still gets you.

468
00:49:00,374 --> 00:49:02,176
How'd you learn to shoot?

469
00:49:09,584 --> 00:49:11,051
This guy Cooper.

470
00:49:12,654 --> 00:49:15,088
My mom left me with him
when she went to work.

471
00:49:16,323 --> 00:49:18,392
He was buildin' an armory.

472
00:49:20,762 --> 00:49:25,098
He always said if the world
went to shit... he'd be ready.

473
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:10,545
Do you ever feel lonely?

474
00:50:12,446 --> 00:50:13,615
Always.

475
00:50:52,286 --> 00:50:53,688
Just a few gallons of gas.

476
00:50:53,721 --> 00:50:55,088
- Oh, you want gas?
- Please, lady.

477
00:50:55,122 --> 00:50:57,257
Well, bring your car!
I'll give you some gas.

478
00:50:57,291 --> 00:50:59,302
I just want a few dollars.
It'd be better so I can buy...

479
00:50:59,326 --> 00:51:02,462
Oh, now you want money! Ask for
money! We're all struggling here!

480
00:51:02,496 --> 00:51:03,397
I just wanna take
my kids to the...

481
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:05,432
You got kids? Go
take care of them.

482
00:51:08,703 --> 00:51:12,139
- See?
- Yeah, I see.

483
00:51:12,172 --> 00:51:15,409
God... And what do
you want me to do?

484
00:51:15,442 --> 00:51:17,879
- Well...
- Resources are so fucking scarce,

485
00:51:17,912 --> 00:51:20,548
they're telling us to prioritize
only infants and toddlers.

486
00:51:20,582 --> 00:51:22,650
Patterson, we can catch
these fucking guys.

487
00:51:22,684 --> 00:51:24,886
It's you and Sterling,
Gerick. That is it.

488
00:51:24,919 --> 00:51:29,189
If we don't bring 'em down now, they just
set up some place else and then what?

489
00:51:29,222 --> 00:51:31,191
Ten more girls? Fifteen?

490
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,361
Trafficking will not go away

491
00:51:34,394 --> 00:51:35,639
until people stop
buying, Gerick.

492
00:51:35,663 --> 00:51:37,632
We know that. All right?

493
00:51:37,665 --> 00:51:39,499
We get these guys
and someone else

494
00:51:39,534 --> 00:51:41,468
is just gonna
satisfy the demand.

495
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:51,144
It could be your
daughter, Patterson.

496
00:52:01,321 --> 00:52:04,358
Hi. I saw you earlier today.

497
00:52:04,391 --> 00:52:10,364
Uh, I was just wondering
if you wanted to come over.

498
00:52:10,397 --> 00:52:13,868
Uh, my mom's making pancakes,
so I just thought...

499
00:52:13,901 --> 00:52:15,637
Thanks, but I don't have time.

500
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:19,139
M-maybe later? We're in the
pink RV over by the store.

501
00:52:21,676 --> 00:52:25,145
Okay, well, maybe later.

502
00:52:25,947 --> 00:52:27,715
Bye then. See ya.

503
00:53:28,543 --> 00:53:29,944
Wow.

504
00:53:31,813 --> 00:53:34,347
Who knew she could still shine.

505
00:53:48,996 --> 00:53:50,531
You said he would help.

506
00:53:50,565 --> 00:53:53,333
You don't read other
people's letters.

507
00:53:53,366 --> 00:53:55,302
He's in fucking jail, so
how's he gonna help us?

508
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:00,775
What do you mean? "Us"?

509
00:54:02,309 --> 00:54:03,878
You and me are not "us".

510
00:54:05,445 --> 00:54:07,882
The only "us" I know
is me and my brother.

511
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,590
Why didn't you tell
me he was in jail?

512
00:54:15,623 --> 00:54:17,825
He's getting out
of jail tomorrow.

513
00:54:17,859 --> 00:54:20,360
'Cause of you, I can't be there.

514
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:25,365
You could've just told me.

515
00:54:25,398 --> 00:54:27,300
None of your fucking business.

516
00:54:49,422 --> 00:54:52,527
Like looking for a
needle in a haystack.

517
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,662
A semi is no needle though.

518
00:54:54,695 --> 00:54:56,898
It stands out pretty
much anywhere.

519
00:55:02,103 --> 00:55:03,604
If I was them...

520
00:55:05,472 --> 00:55:09,944
I'd duck into someplace
familiar and just lay low.

521
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:13,748
And a young girl with a trucker
might stand out just enough

522
00:55:13,781 --> 00:55:15,950
for someone to
have taken notice.

523
00:55:17,118 --> 00:55:19,386
- Yeah.
- Wait.

524
00:55:19,419 --> 00:55:21,556
You're not suggesting
we go analog

525
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:23,124
and go to every truck stop ever?

526
00:55:23,157 --> 00:55:25,560
- 'Cause there's... there's many.
- There aren't that many.

527
00:55:25,593 --> 00:55:28,629
And a guy like this won't stray
far from his comfort zone.

528
00:55:28,663 --> 00:55:30,998
You're driving. Let's go.

529
00:56:57,251 --> 00:56:58,886
- Hello.
<i>- Oh, shit.</i>

530
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,555
<i>I was worried about
you. I worked it out.</i>

531
00:57:01,589 --> 00:57:02,933
<i>We gotta get the
girl back to them,</i>

532
00:57:02,957 --> 00:57:04,491
<i>and they'll let us off the hook.</i>

533
00:57:04,525 --> 00:57:06,560
<i>- Where you at?</i>
- Sherrigan's.

534
00:57:06,594 --> 00:57:08,696
Heading to Arkansas
tomorrow like you told me.

535
00:57:08,729 --> 00:57:11,232
<i>Okay. Okay.
Everything good there?</i>

536
00:57:11,265 --> 00:57:16,771
- Yeah. All's good.
<i>- Great. Okay.</i>

537
00:57:16,804 --> 00:57:19,874
- I love you.
- <i>I love you, too.</i>

538
00:57:19,907 --> 00:57:23,144
<i>Just keep the girl close.
She's our lifeline, sis.</i>

539
00:57:23,177 --> 00:57:25,112
- Yeah.
- <i>Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

540
00:57:25,146 --> 00:57:27,782
- Yeah.
- <i>I think we're gonna be okay.</i>

541
00:59:06,714 --> 00:59:07,715
Hello.

542
00:59:07,748 --> 00:59:08,783
Okay.

543
00:59:10,251 --> 00:59:11,685
All right, we're on our way.

544
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,189
We got 'em. Take a left.

545
01:00:02,203 --> 01:00:05,106
All right, all right,
all right, let's see.

546
01:00:05,139 --> 01:00:09,343
Okay. Rock, okay.
It starts with rock.

547
01:00:09,376 --> 01:00:11,645
And then scissors cuts paper.

548
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:14,014
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

549
01:00:14,782 --> 01:00:16,083
Rock, pa...

550
01:00:16,117 --> 01:00:18,652
Rock, paper,
scissors, gun, shoot.

551
01:00:18,686 --> 01:00:21,322
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

552
01:00:21,355 --> 01:00:23,023
What the heck?

553
01:00:23,057 --> 01:00:25,392
Okay, rock, shoot.

554
01:00:37,771 --> 01:00:42,076
What you got there,
Yale? Toothbrush?

555
01:00:43,244 --> 01:00:44,845
Yeah, I drink a lot of coffee.

556
01:00:46,113 --> 01:00:49,683
Okay. All right.

557
01:00:49,717 --> 01:00:52,086
It's our fourth stop today.

558
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:53,719
What's gonna be
different about this one?

559
01:00:54,288 --> 01:00:55,990
You wanted field work.

560
01:00:56,023 --> 01:00:57,892
This is the field.

561
01:00:57,925 --> 01:01:01,162
Sorry, it's not as sexy as
you thought it would be.

562
01:01:01,195 --> 01:01:03,364
Let's see what we find.

563
01:01:18,946 --> 01:01:20,314
Shot of whiskey.

564
01:01:52,279 --> 01:01:56,317
My youngest is sick and we just
need a few dollars for the bus.

565
01:01:56,350 --> 01:01:59,920
You have kids, right? You
know what I'm goin' through.

566
01:02:04,792 --> 01:02:08,862
Excuse me, sir. I have... I have a sick
mother at home and my car broke down.

567
01:02:08,896 --> 01:02:11,899
I really... I just
need a few bucks.

568
01:02:14,101 --> 01:02:18,839
You got kids? You got kids?
You got kids, don't you?

569
01:02:18,872 --> 01:02:20,407
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey, baby.

570
01:02:29,083 --> 01:02:31,519
Thank you. Thank you, ma'am.

571
01:02:31,553 --> 01:02:33,053
- Okay, now.
- Thank you.

572
01:02:33,087 --> 01:02:34,989
- Thank you.
- All right.

573
01:02:35,022 --> 01:02:36,957
Thank you.

574
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,868
Do you ever feel lonely?

575
01:02:49,537 --> 01:02:52,206
Mm, no, not really.

576
01:02:54,174 --> 01:02:58,012
Mm, how about, like,
when you're with people?

577
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,283
That maybe you'll
always be lonely

578
01:03:02,316 --> 01:03:05,819
because no one knows the
world the same as you do?

579
01:03:08,289 --> 01:03:09,823
Uh...

580
01:03:18,399 --> 01:03:20,067
I haven't seen any little girl.

581
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:22,269
I am so sure I
would've noticed that,

582
01:03:22,303 --> 01:03:24,471
but I only work certain shifts.

583
01:03:24,506 --> 01:03:26,874
Well, what about personnel?

584
01:03:26,907 --> 01:03:29,076
Is there anyone
here consistently

585
01:03:29,109 --> 01:03:32,479
who might've noticed
something suspicious?

586
01:03:32,514 --> 01:03:35,015
Well, I think your best bet
might be to go over there

587
01:03:35,049 --> 01:03:36,518
to the bar and talk
to the bartender.

588
01:03:36,551 --> 01:03:38,886
He knows most everybody
coming in and outta here.

589
01:03:38,919 --> 01:03:41,055
And the regulars,
they're always around.

590
01:03:41,088 --> 01:03:42,356
Okay.

591
01:03:42,389 --> 01:03:44,024
<i>♪ Yeah, yeah ♪</i>

592
01:04:21,061 --> 01:04:23,130
Excuse me, ma'am.

593
01:04:23,163 --> 01:04:25,165
- Yeah.
- Excuse me, ma'am.

594
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:26,568
What can I do for you...

595
01:04:26,601 --> 01:04:31,105
Officer Finley Sterling?

596
01:04:31,138 --> 01:04:32,306
Is that a real name?

597
01:04:32,339 --> 01:04:33,675
Some of my friends call me Yale,

598
01:04:33,708 --> 01:04:36,110
if that makes things
easier for you.

599
01:04:36,143 --> 01:04:38,011
We're just looking
for a truck driver

600
01:04:38,045 --> 01:04:39,514
with a little girl with him.

601
01:04:39,547 --> 01:04:40,981
Huh?

602
01:04:41,014 --> 01:04:43,350
Uh, about five foot tall.

603
01:04:44,351 --> 01:04:46,053
Uh, dark brown hair.

604
01:04:46,086 --> 01:04:47,166
You seen anybody like that?

605
01:04:50,224 --> 01:04:51,559
Nope.

606
01:04:51,593 --> 01:04:53,360
Okay, thank you.
Have a good night.

607
01:04:54,161 --> 01:04:55,162
And you.

608
01:05:26,493 --> 01:05:28,095
Sally.

609
01:05:39,306 --> 01:05:40,575
- Hey.
- I'm okay.

610
01:05:40,608 --> 01:05:42,309
- You okay?
- Good.

611
01:05:42,342 --> 01:05:44,679
Okay. Do you live around here?

612
01:05:44,712 --> 01:05:46,980
No?

613
01:05:47,014 --> 01:05:48,115
What's your name?

614
01:05:49,383 --> 01:05:51,686
Okay. Let's get you back
to your truck, okay?

615
01:05:51,719 --> 01:05:54,021
- Yeah.
- You think you can show us the way?

616
01:05:56,658 --> 01:06:00,427
Oh. Watch your step, hon.

617
01:06:00,461 --> 01:06:02,664
Had a little too much
to drink tonight, huh?

618
01:06:02,697 --> 01:06:05,499
- Happens to the
best of us, right?

619
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:21,749
Which one's your truck, huh?

620
01:06:23,317 --> 01:06:24,318
Is it this one?

621
01:06:24,351 --> 01:06:26,019
All right, let's get your keys.

622
01:06:26,053 --> 01:06:27,655
Where's your keys, huh?

623
01:06:31,358 --> 01:06:33,460
- Watch her, Tesz.
- Got her.

624
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:41,368
- There's no one in here.
- What?

625
01:06:41,401 --> 01:06:43,170
I'm sayin' there's no
fucking girl in here.

626
01:06:43,203 --> 01:06:45,573
Oh, fuck. Where is she?

627
01:06:45,607 --> 01:06:47,274
Huh?

628
01:06:47,307 --> 01:06:50,110
I said, where the
fuck is the girl?

629
01:06:50,143 --> 01:06:51,411
What a dump.

630
01:06:51,445 --> 01:06:53,080
There's nothing
in here but crap.

631
01:06:53,113 --> 01:06:54,682
What? You sure?

632
01:06:57,284 --> 01:06:59,052
What is all this shit?

633
01:06:59,086 --> 01:07:01,623
- What the hell is this, huh?
- Where's the girl, huh?

634
01:07:04,659 --> 01:07:05,703
Where the fuck is the girl?

635
01:07:05,727 --> 01:07:07,762
- I don't... I don't know.
- Wake up, wake up.

636
01:07:07,795 --> 01:07:09,731
Wake up, get up.

637
01:07:09,764 --> 01:07:13,467
Show me where...

638
01:07:19,306 --> 01:07:21,041
Oh, shit!

639
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:26,313
- What the fuck?
- She's shot a guy before.

640
01:07:27,815 --> 01:07:31,451
Hey, Deborah. Get out here.

641
01:07:32,654 --> 01:07:34,656
What the fuck, Tesz?

642
01:07:34,689 --> 01:07:37,692
Shit.

643
01:07:37,725 --> 01:07:39,326
Hey, what's going on out there?

644
01:07:40,762 --> 01:07:42,597
Shut the fuck up!
I'm tryin' to sleep!

645
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:44,197
Come on, Sally.

646
01:07:44,231 --> 01:07:46,099
Get in the truck.

647
01:07:46,901 --> 01:07:47,901
Here.

648
01:07:50,137 --> 01:07:52,372
- Come on! Get in the truck!
- She's got a gun.

649
01:07:52,406 --> 01:07:53,808
Hey, careful.

650
01:07:56,476 --> 01:07:59,146
I'm tired of this shit.
Tryin' to sleep over here.

651
01:08:02,884 --> 01:08:04,184
Get the fuck outta here!

652
01:08:04,217 --> 01:08:05,352
You fucked up my eye, bitch.

653
01:08:05,385 --> 01:08:07,187
- Fuck you!
- Shut the fuck...

654
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:09,757
Hey!

655
01:08:09,791 --> 01:08:11,458
Get the car, get the car.

656
01:08:20,735 --> 01:08:22,169
- Straight out.
- Yeah.

657
01:08:25,673 --> 01:08:27,407
What the fuck?

658
01:08:27,441 --> 01:08:28,442
Is that her truck?

659
01:08:40,521 --> 01:08:43,123
- What the fuck?
- Is she gonna fucking hit us?

660
01:08:58,906 --> 01:09:00,541
Keep her there. Hold her.

661
01:09:02,944 --> 01:09:04,411
Again.

662
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,756
- We need to talk to her.
- Her?

663
01:09:18,492 --> 01:09:21,328
It's a blue cab truck.
Keep it in sight.

664
01:09:25,465 --> 01:09:26,901
- You get the plates?
- Yeah.

665
01:09:30,404 --> 01:09:32,305
- All right.
- No!

666
01:09:32,339 --> 01:09:34,450
- Wait. What the fuck are you doing?
- She's getting away!

667
01:09:34,474 --> 01:09:36,834
We don't wanna get into a fucking
car chase with the police!

668
01:09:47,487 --> 01:09:48,756
Calm down, all right?

669
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:50,558
I don't want you
to hurt yourself.

670
01:10:13,313 --> 01:10:14,313
Pull right.

671
01:10:19,386 --> 01:10:20,555
Straighten out!

672
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:24,317
Fuck!

673
01:12:38,926 --> 01:12:40,728
<i>In other news, the police</i>

674
01:12:40,761 --> 01:12:41,963

Hmm.

- We should get going.
- Oh, no.

Right.

681
01:13:09,156 --> 01:13:11,125
Can we go to this place?

682
01:13:14,161 --> 01:13:16,097
It's not far from here.

683

There ain't nobody there.

685
01:13:27,608 --> 01:13:31,512

How the hell can
they be lost, man?

687
01:13:35,116 --> 01:13:36,984
They're in a blue rig.

688

All the roads around here
aren't even on the map, sir.

690

Well, get a chopper in the
air, man, for fuck's sake.

691
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,728
You think we got a
chopper around here?

692
01:13:47,762 --> 01:13:49,797
Get a news chopper,
I don't care!

693
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:51,165
Weather chopper!

694
01:13:51,198 --> 01:13:53,466
- What?
- She's ready to talk.

695
01:13:57,672 --> 01:14:00,150
You know, sometimes people help
you more if you're not an asshole.

696
01:14:00,174 --> 01:14:02,843
- I'm only an asshole to you.
- You're an asshole to everyone.

697
01:14:02,877 --> 01:14:04,545
And you.

698
01:14:04,578 --> 01:14:07,480
I don't work for nobody, sir.

699
01:14:07,515 --> 01:14:09,517
Some woman asked if
we wanted some cash.

700
01:14:09,550 --> 01:14:13,020
I don't know the bitch.
Don't know the trucker lady.

701
01:14:13,054 --> 01:14:15,756
And don't know the girl
who took a swing at me.

702
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:17,591
The girl took a swing at you?

703
01:14:17,625 --> 01:14:20,861
Yeah. She was the one
holding the gun, too.

704
01:14:28,135 --> 01:14:29,837
You'll like our trailer.

705
01:14:29,870 --> 01:14:31,639
It's nice.

706
01:14:34,976 --> 01:14:37,044
Our trailer is bright blue,

707
01:14:37,078 --> 01:14:38,746
so you'll know it
when you see it.

708
01:14:40,047 --> 01:14:41,549
My mom painted it.

709
01:14:47,054 --> 01:14:48,656
Your friend Cooper's place?

710
01:14:50,992 --> 01:14:53,761
Yeah. That was his place.

711
01:14:56,263 --> 01:14:58,141
Our trailer... our trailer's
right behind the pink flamingo,

712
01:14:58,165 --> 01:14:59,900
so you'll see it
in just a second.

713
01:15:24,792 --> 01:15:26,994
It was just
prescriptions at first.

714
01:15:30,931 --> 01:15:33,968
She only took what the fucking
doctor told her to take.

715
01:15:43,244 --> 01:15:46,180
I didn't wanna stay
at another group home.

716
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:51,018
So I ran.

717
01:16:15,009 --> 01:16:16,677
My mom loved me.

718
01:16:26,353 --> 01:16:28,956
But that stuff made
her happy every time.

719
01:16:46,774 --> 01:16:50,611
You know, I've never actually
been to the ocean before.

720
01:16:57,184 --> 01:16:59,820
Well, you're lucky to
know where you wanna go.

721
01:17:01,822 --> 01:17:03,924
I only know what
I'm running from.

722
01:17:15,035 --> 01:17:16,070
You out?

723
01:17:16,103 --> 01:17:17,071
<i>Yeah.</i>

724
01:17:17,104 --> 01:17:18,272
<i>Finally.</i>

725
01:17:18,305 --> 01:17:19,273
You're at the house?

726
01:17:19,306 --> 01:17:21,308
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I'm home.</i>

727
01:17:21,342 --> 01:17:23,110
<i>I thought you'd be here already.</i>

728
01:17:23,144 --> 01:17:26,213
<i>I'm so nervous, Sal,
about the girl, you know.</i>

729
01:17:26,247 --> 01:17:28,215
<i>We gotta get her
to them tonight.</i>

730
01:17:28,249 --> 01:17:30,017
<i>They're gonna let
me know what time.</i>

731
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:32,353
<i>You promise me
you'll get her home.</i>

732
01:17:32,386 --> 01:17:35,222
<i>Oh, shit... They're-they're
calling me again.</i>

733
01:17:35,256 --> 01:17:36,891
<i>Sal, I...</i>

734
01:17:50,437 --> 01:17:54,708
Dad used to beat us, and
Dennis took the brunt of it

735
01:17:54,742 --> 01:17:57,077
for as long as he
could to protect me.

736
01:17:57,111 --> 01:18:01,415
And it... it hurt him. It
carved a piece out of him.

737
01:18:04,885 --> 01:18:07,421
It's my turn to take
care of him this time.

738
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:22,403
<i>Joining conference now.</i>

739
01:18:22,436 --> 01:18:24,004
<i>Welcome, Sally.</i>

740
01:18:24,038 --> 01:18:26,040
<i>Didn't think you'd
make it on here today.</i>

741
01:18:26,073 --> 01:18:27,841
<i>How was it pickin'
up your brother?</i>

742
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:31,378
Hey, ladies. I got
a favor to ask you.

743
01:18:31,412 --> 01:18:34,114
<i>No way! Did he fuck up already?</i>

744
01:18:34,148 --> 01:18:36,317
It's not for my
brother. It's for me.

745
01:18:42,156 --> 01:18:45,292
The truck's been sighted!
Positive match on the plates!

746
01:19:42,082 --> 01:19:43,260
Step out of the vehicle, ma'am.

747
01:19:43,284 --> 01:19:45,853
This a vehicle inspection, sir?

748
01:19:45,886 --> 01:19:47,522
Please step out, ma'am.

749
01:19:47,555 --> 01:19:48,822
All right.

750
01:19:58,399 --> 01:20:00,000
CDL, please.

751
01:20:01,969 --> 01:20:03,203
Follow me.

752
01:21:49,677 --> 01:21:51,245
Give me a moment, will ya?

753
01:21:57,017 --> 01:21:58,686
All right if I call you Sally?

754
01:22:01,488 --> 01:22:03,223
We're looking for a young girl.

755
01:22:04,726 --> 01:22:06,059
Dark hair.

756
01:22:07,294 --> 01:22:10,063
Thought you might've seen her.

757
01:22:10,097 --> 01:22:13,367
You and your partner asked around
the bar at Sherrigan's last night.

758
01:22:14,301 --> 01:22:15,936
I haven't seen her, sir.

759
01:22:18,005 --> 01:22:20,508
What happened to your face?

760
01:22:20,542 --> 01:22:22,710
Didn't I tell you I was
at the bar last night?

761
01:22:22,744 --> 01:22:25,345
Oh.

762
01:22:25,379 --> 01:22:28,015
And it looks like your
truck took a beating for ya.

763
01:22:29,517 --> 01:22:31,318
Was she there, too?

764
01:22:31,351 --> 01:22:36,356
You know it, sir. She
and me, we're one.

765
01:22:38,058 --> 01:22:39,359
Where are you from?

766
01:22:40,562 --> 01:22:43,430
Nowhere, and everywhere.

767
01:22:44,398 --> 01:22:46,233
That's America for you.

768
01:22:47,401 --> 01:22:49,336
But you've been
here a long time.

769
01:22:52,574 --> 01:22:54,007
Where do you live?

770
01:22:55,242 --> 01:22:57,344
Right here, sir, in my truck.

771
01:22:57,377 --> 01:23:02,115
I hear ya. My car
often becomes my bed.

772
01:23:02,617 --> 01:23:03,651
I don't mind.

773
01:23:05,052 --> 01:23:07,522
Solitude is nice.

774
01:23:07,555 --> 01:23:11,526
Well, sorry to bother
you. Have a nice ride.

775
01:23:11,559 --> 01:23:12,594
Oh, um...

776
01:23:14,829 --> 01:23:16,497
Where you headed?

777
01:23:16,531 --> 01:23:18,198
Across the river.

778
01:23:18,232 --> 01:23:20,133
- Arkansas?
- Arkansas.

779
01:23:20,167 --> 01:23:21,468
I figured.

780
01:23:24,471 --> 01:23:26,641
Look, Sally...

781
01:23:26,674 --> 01:23:31,311
there are some bad people out,
wantin' to hurt that girl.

782
01:23:31,345 --> 01:23:33,581
The police are
looking for a killer.

783
01:23:33,615 --> 01:23:36,116
That's not what I'm after.

784
01:23:36,149 --> 01:23:37,585
I just want to help her

785
01:23:37,619 --> 01:23:39,554
and whoever's trying
to be good to her.

786
01:23:39,587 --> 01:23:40,588
You understand?

787
01:23:42,824 --> 01:23:45,325
Here. This is my number.

788
01:23:47,695 --> 01:23:50,163
I don't trust the system
any more than you do,

789
01:23:51,533 --> 01:23:53,568
but some of us are not all bad.

790
01:23:54,569 --> 01:23:55,637
Okay?

791
01:23:57,237 --> 01:24:00,608
All right. Well,
have a nice ride.

792
01:24:22,262 --> 01:24:23,598
Yeah.

793
01:24:28,201 --> 01:24:30,070
You wanna tell me what
you're not telling them?

794
01:24:32,607 --> 01:24:35,108
She's with the girl all right.

795
01:24:35,142 --> 01:24:38,513
But that lady trucker's
not who we're looking for.

796
01:24:38,546 --> 01:24:40,782
I think the girl was
safe here with her.

797
01:24:40,815 --> 01:24:45,152
Last thing we need is a bunch of cops
running after them with guns drawn.

798
01:24:46,621 --> 01:24:49,456
Oh, we'll keep an eye on her.

799
01:24:49,489 --> 01:24:52,426
Let her guide us to whoever
she's running away from.

800
01:24:54,494 --> 01:24:57,230
See, people are more helpful
if you're not an asshole.

801
01:25:00,233 --> 01:25:01,335
Yeah, all right.

802
01:25:03,236 --> 01:25:04,504
I have a call in at Utica.

803
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,575
- Utica?
- Her brother.

804
01:25:09,409 --> 01:25:12,379
Petty crimes mostly, worse
up through the years.

805
01:25:12,412 --> 01:25:16,216
He was transporting
duffels and got caught.

806
01:25:16,249 --> 01:25:19,186
Five years
incarcerated at Utica.

807
01:25:19,219 --> 01:25:21,656
Same place Paul
McKinney did time.

808
01:25:21,689 --> 01:25:24,458
That's too much
of a coincidence.

809
01:25:24,491 --> 01:25:27,461
Her brother incarcerated
in the same place as...

810
01:25:28,428 --> 01:25:30,163
What do they call him?

811
01:25:30,197 --> 01:25:32,299
Oh, the Mud Victim.

812
01:25:32,332 --> 01:25:36,336
Ah. See, that's poetry, Yale.

813
01:26:18,311 --> 01:26:19,479
Motherfucker.

814
01:26:33,594 --> 01:26:36,229
This will do.

815
01:26:36,263 --> 01:26:38,733
We won't get far with her
if she feels threatened.

816
01:26:46,841 --> 01:26:49,309
- Oh, hi.
- Hey. How you doin'?

817
01:26:57,451 --> 01:26:59,453
Here you go, ma'am.

818
01:26:59,486 --> 01:27:00,588
All right.

819
01:27:52,472 --> 01:27:53,608
Let's get going.

820
01:27:53,641 --> 01:27:54,675
Thanks, Rose.

821
01:27:55,643 --> 01:27:57,678
You okay, Sally?

822
01:27:57,712 --> 01:27:58,679
Fine.

823
01:27:58,713 --> 01:28:01,281
You sold your trailer?

824
01:28:02,817 --> 01:28:05,820
I'm gonna stay in the area,
Sal. Dolly's passin' by, too.

825
01:28:05,853 --> 01:28:07,822
Just so you know in
case you need anythin'.

826
01:28:10,825 --> 01:28:12,292
Where?

827
01:28:13,728 --> 01:28:14,996
He's out already?

828
01:28:16,564 --> 01:28:17,932
What?

829
01:28:17,965 --> 01:28:19,066
I'll call you back.

830
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:21,769

Yeah, besides processing.

852

Then check bank accounts,
insurance, I don't know.

853
01:29:53,127 --> 01:29:55,162
No, I'm not yelling at
you, David, I just...

854
01:29:55,196 --> 01:29:57,798
All right, just get back to
me, all right? Keep a record.

855
01:29:57,832 --> 01:30:01,035
Guy gave her cash for the trailer.
Doesn't know shit about her.

856
01:30:01,068 --> 01:30:03,838
He got out of the sick ward
a week ago. Taking a beating.

857
01:30:03,871 --> 01:30:09,143
Fuck. Fucking prisons.

858
01:30:09,176 --> 01:30:12,079
We lock 'em up, and we're just
creating a breeding ground.

859
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:43,077
It's a long straight
ball to center field!

860
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:46,047
Home run!

861
01:30:51,752 --> 01:30:53,254
Oh, come here.

862
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:01,996
Hey. What'd they do to you?

863
01:31:02,029 --> 01:31:05,599
Hey. Can't you smile anymore?

864
01:31:13,708 --> 01:31:16,077
Oh. Oh, wow.

865
01:31:16,110 --> 01:31:19,146
She is... she is really young.

866
01:31:21,082 --> 01:31:22,750
When do we go meet 'em?

867
01:31:25,052 --> 01:31:29,190
Well, they told me bring her out to
the airfield about eleven o'clock.

868
01:31:38,899 --> 01:31:40,601
Here, here.

869
01:31:40,634 --> 01:31:42,502
Why don't you have
a seat right there?

870
01:31:56,617 --> 01:31:57,952
Remember that?

871
01:32:06,327 --> 01:32:08,129
I'm sorry I can't
get you anything.

872
01:32:08,162 --> 01:32:10,564
You know, nobody's been here
for the past couple of years

873
01:32:10,598 --> 01:32:12,266
since... since our dad died.

874
01:32:12,299 --> 01:32:14,035
That's fine.

875
01:32:33,754 --> 01:32:35,589
That. Don't you touch that.

876
01:32:35,623 --> 01:32:37,691
Get your paws off my trophy.

877
01:32:56,977 --> 01:32:58,979
You know, I was... I was...

878
01:32:59,013 --> 01:33:00,915
I was happy when you got away.

879
01:33:02,149 --> 01:33:03,250
- I was.
- I know.

880
01:33:06,954 --> 01:33:10,224
I didn't have to... I didn't
have to think about...

881
01:33:10,257 --> 01:33:13,294
listening to something
happen to you every night.

882
01:33:29,743 --> 01:33:31,812
It's not as bad as I thought.

883
01:33:33,681 --> 01:33:36,717
I mean, the mess is as bad
as I thought it'd be, but...

884
01:33:44,091 --> 01:33:45,359
It doesn't scare me anymore.

885
01:33:46,293 --> 01:33:47,928
Well, that's good to hear.

886
01:33:52,099 --> 01:33:55,302
Should we, uh...
should we get going?

887
01:33:55,336 --> 01:33:57,404
Sure. Where?

888
01:34:04,879 --> 01:34:06,280
You're right about me, you know.

889
01:34:08,949 --> 01:34:10,050
What?

890
01:34:11,318 --> 01:34:13,187
I know nothing about this.

891
01:34:15,956 --> 01:34:17,858
Grew up with a silver spoon.

892
01:34:18,959 --> 01:34:21,462
Completely disconnected.

893
01:34:21,495 --> 01:34:23,430
And the strongest
memory I have of my mom

894
01:34:23,464 --> 01:34:27,368
was her picture
hanging above my crib.

895
01:34:27,401 --> 01:34:31,005
And I joined the bureau so I
could mean something to someone.

896
01:34:32,907 --> 01:34:34,909
Can't say that's working out.

897
01:34:38,245 --> 01:34:39,680
Why'd you join?

898
01:34:41,815 --> 01:34:43,484
Doesn't matter why I joined.

899
01:34:43,518 --> 01:34:45,986
Only matters what I do with it.

900
01:34:52,893 --> 01:34:53,928
Yeah.

901
01:34:55,062 --> 01:34:56,463
What?

902
01:34:56,497 --> 01:34:59,700
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

903
01:35:01,368 --> 01:35:04,438
Hospital has Sally on
file. Over 30 years ago.

904
01:35:04,471 --> 01:35:08,842
Numerous ER visits,
various, um... accidents.

905
01:35:08,876 --> 01:35:10,744
She was brought
in by her brother.

906
01:35:10,778 --> 01:35:12,213
There's a home address.

907
01:35:16,917 --> 01:35:22,189
Uh... I don't wanna
give her back.

908
01:35:22,223 --> 01:35:24,024
I wanna buy her out.

909
01:35:26,193 --> 01:35:27,361
The girl?

910
01:35:27,394 --> 01:35:28,963
Leila, yeah.

911
01:35:31,899 --> 01:35:34,301
Well, what are you
gonna do with her?

912
01:35:35,570 --> 01:35:37,004
Where are you gonna
get the money?

913
01:35:37,037 --> 01:35:38,540
I have some money.

914
01:35:38,573 --> 01:35:39,907
How much?

915
01:35:41,976 --> 01:35:43,477
How'd you get it?

916
01:35:43,511 --> 01:35:47,081
Enough. I should have
some left over, too.

917
01:35:47,114 --> 01:35:49,283
- Mm-hmm.
- How did you get it?

918
01:35:52,286 --> 01:35:54,154
How'd you get the money, Sal?

919
01:35:55,089 --> 01:35:56,757
Sold my trailer.

920
01:36:11,905 --> 01:36:13,307
She needs us.

921
01:36:14,875 --> 01:36:16,777
The way we needed each other.

922
01:36:19,246 --> 01:36:22,216
You mean like a... Like
a family or something?

923
01:36:28,455 --> 01:36:29,957
Well...

924
01:36:29,990 --> 01:36:31,325
Well, that would take me

925
01:36:31,358 --> 01:36:34,161
just a little bit of
time to get used to.

926
01:36:34,194 --> 01:36:35,362
You know?

927
01:36:37,998 --> 01:36:39,099
Yeah.

928
01:36:50,311 --> 01:36:52,179
All right.

929
01:36:52,212 --> 01:36:55,249
We do this, you gotta let me
take care of it, all right?

930
01:36:55,282 --> 01:36:56,618
I'm gonna bring 'em the cash.

931
01:36:56,651 --> 01:36:59,186
Pay. Done.

932
01:37:00,588 --> 01:37:03,357
All right. Okay.

933
01:37:07,428 --> 01:37:09,029
Where's the bathroom?

934
01:37:09,063 --> 01:37:11,432
We're-we're gonna take
a little ride. Uh...

935
01:37:11,465 --> 01:37:15,436
No. No. Leila stays with me.

936
01:37:15,469 --> 01:37:18,372
No, that's not how it works,
sis. I gotta bring her.

937
01:37:18,405 --> 01:37:21,141
You-you could've taken her to
the police for all they know.

938
01:37:21,175 --> 01:37:23,344
All right. I'll go then.

939
01:37:23,377 --> 01:37:25,312
No, Sal. Sal.

940
01:37:25,346 --> 01:37:27,549
If she's going, I'm going.
Uh, Leila, let's go.

941
01:37:27,582 --> 01:37:29,517
- Sal.
- I still have to pee.

942
01:37:29,551 --> 01:37:31,251
It's-it's just right here.

943
01:37:31,285 --> 01:37:34,088
- Useless...
- I'll turn the truck around.

944
01:37:34,121 --> 01:37:35,222
It's just a bad idea.

945
01:37:35,255 --> 01:37:36,390
Get out of your pajamas.

946
01:37:36,423 --> 01:37:37,559
It's time to go.

947
01:37:48,469 --> 01:37:51,105
<i>Joining conference now.</i>

948
01:37:51,138 --> 01:37:52,339
Sally's here.

949
01:37:52,373 --> 01:37:54,274
Hi, Sally.

950
01:37:54,308 --> 01:37:56,076
<i>Dolly's here with us.</i>

951
01:37:56,110 --> 01:37:58,546
That's right, Rose.
Pattie's here, too.

952
01:37:58,580 --> 01:38:01,583
<i>She's slow as a little
turtle, just like you, Sally.</i>

953
01:38:01,616 --> 01:38:04,451
Come on, baby doll, get with it.

954
01:38:04,485 --> 01:38:06,654
<i>- I'm just sayin'.
- Shut up, Dolly.</i>

955
01:38:06,688 --> 01:38:10,124
<i>Sally's got some serious
business to take care of.</i>

956
01:38:10,157 --> 01:38:11,526
<i>Where are you headed?</i>

957
01:38:11,559 --> 01:38:15,129
Remember that old
airport? Southeast?

958
01:38:15,162 --> 01:38:17,331
Hell yeah, I
remember that place.

959
01:38:17,364 --> 01:38:21,101
Yeah, me too, I was gonna be a flight
attendant before I broke my teeth.

960
01:38:24,204 --> 01:38:30,043
Just wanna tell ya, it's good to
know you ladies are out there.

961
01:38:30,077 --> 01:38:32,212
We're always out here.

962
01:38:32,246 --> 01:38:33,648
<i>Come rain or come shine.</i>

963
01:38:42,322 --> 01:38:45,359
Dennis? Leila?

964
01:38:47,227 --> 01:38:48,462
Let's go!

965
01:38:50,264 --> 01:38:51,432
You look fucked up.

966
01:38:51,465 --> 01:38:53,434
Huh? Oh, yeah?

967
01:38:53,467 --> 01:38:56,336
Oh, yeah. Freezing out there.

968
01:38:56,370 --> 01:38:59,206
Well, Leila found something.
I think you're gonna like it.

969
01:39:03,277 --> 01:39:05,979
Sal, what are you doin'?

970
01:39:09,283 --> 01:39:10,718
What are you doin'?

971
01:39:10,752 --> 01:39:13,120
It's-it's-it's-it's the dress

972
01:39:13,153 --> 01:39:15,489
that dad bought you
for your 13th birthday.

973
01:39:15,523 --> 01:39:17,324
I thought you'd like it.

974
01:39:17,357 --> 01:39:20,227
- I thought you'd like it, Sal.
- Take it off. Take it off, Leila.

975
01:39:20,260 --> 01:39:21,639
Sal... I-I thought
you'd think it was cute.

976
01:39:21,663 --> 01:39:22,630
I thought you'd like it. I...

977
01:39:22,664 --> 01:39:24,498
- I don't!
- All right, all right,

978
01:39:24,532 --> 01:39:27,602
- I fucked up. I'm sorry!
- Take it off!

979
01:40:16,450 --> 01:40:17,519
It's clear.

980
01:40:37,872 --> 01:40:39,072
Hair.

981
01:40:40,808 --> 01:40:42,276
They were here.

982
01:40:44,478 --> 01:40:45,479
We missed 'em.

983
01:40:48,282 --> 01:40:52,152
Shit, shit, shit, shit. Shit!

984
01:41:17,745 --> 01:41:18,813
I'll go.

985
01:41:34,227 --> 01:41:35,462
Where's the girl?

986
01:41:35,495 --> 01:41:37,130
I wanna buy her out.

987
01:41:38,866 --> 01:41:40,400
That wasn't the deal.

988
01:41:40,434 --> 01:41:42,336
I'll pay more than
the going rate.

989
01:41:43,705 --> 01:41:44,672
Let me see her.

990
01:41:44,706 --> 01:41:45,740
No.

991
01:41:49,343 --> 01:41:51,378
- Come on.
- Dennis!

992
01:41:53,815 --> 01:41:55,382
I have the cash.

993
01:41:57,719 --> 01:41:59,486
But I need to know
we're cut clean.

994
01:42:00,555 --> 01:42:03,223
My brother, me, the girl.

995
01:42:03,256 --> 01:42:04,859
And we don't see you anymore.

996
01:42:08,395 --> 01:42:11,899
Sure. You bought it, you own it.

997
01:42:22,977 --> 01:42:26,446
Really? You think I'm just
gonna let you take the girl?

998
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:28,616
How do I know you won't talk?

999
01:42:28,650 --> 01:42:31,284
'Cause I'm just as
guilty as everybody else.

1000
01:42:33,655 --> 01:42:35,599
- That's it, just get the girl
and let's get out of here!

1001
01:42:35,623 --> 01:42:37,959
Don't hurt my sister! I
said, don't hurt my sister!

1002
01:42:37,992 --> 01:42:39,694
- Back here!
- Hey.

1003
01:42:39,727 --> 01:42:40,928
Get the girl and let's go!

1004
01:42:40,962 --> 01:42:42,462
Hey!

1005
01:42:43,998 --> 01:42:44,899
- Hey!
- Fuck!

1006
01:42:44,932 --> 01:42:47,300
Hey! Easy.

1007
01:42:47,334 --> 01:42:49,336
- Den...
- Hey! Get off her!

1008
01:42:49,369 --> 01:42:50,547
- Get off her! Hey!
- Fuck you!

1009
01:42:50,571 --> 01:42:52,272
- Hey, go easy!
- Get him!

1010
01:42:55,409 --> 01:42:57,477
Dennis, what?

1011
01:43:00,380 --> 01:43:03,885
I said... I told him
not to hurt my sister.

1012
01:43:03,918 --> 01:43:05,987
You said to make it look real!

1013
01:43:06,020 --> 01:43:09,289
Not that real! I said
don't hurt my sister!

1014
01:43:09,322 --> 01:43:12,593
You didn't have to kill him!

1015
01:43:12,627 --> 01:43:15,362
Why couldn't you just get
the fucking kid, Claire? Huh?

1016
01:43:17,431 --> 01:43:19,399
I told you exactly
where she was!

1017
01:43:19,433 --> 01:43:21,368
- Now get in the van!
- Let go!

1018
01:43:21,401 --> 01:43:22,502
- Dennis?
- Let go of me!

1019
01:43:22,537 --> 01:43:23,547
You-you weren't
supposed to see this.

1020
01:43:23,571 --> 01:43:25,973
- No, Sal. Sal, listen, Sal...
- Let go of me!

1021
01:43:26,007 --> 01:43:27,542
- Dennis...
- Let go of me!

1022
01:43:27,575 --> 01:43:30,410
Stop it! Sal, you weren't
supposed to see this.

1023
01:43:30,444 --> 01:43:32,345
Sal. Sal, no! Let her go!

1024
01:43:32,379 --> 01:43:33,815
Let her go! Let her go.

1025
01:43:34,982 --> 01:43:37,885
I was just gonna do it for a
bit till we got on our feet.

1026
01:43:37,919 --> 01:43:40,454
Sal, you were not
supposed to see this.

1027
01:43:40,487 --> 01:43:43,558
Get in the fucking van, Claire!

1028
01:43:46,894 --> 01:43:48,428
Sal...

1029
01:43:48,462 --> 01:43:49,564
Please...

1030
01:43:49,597 --> 01:43:51,599
Claire, get in the van.

1031
01:43:54,602 --> 01:43:56,403
- Please.
- Let me get rid of her, okay?

1032
01:43:56,436 --> 01:43:57,839
Just let me get rid of her,

1033
01:43:57,872 --> 01:44:01,274
and-and we get back
to us, Sal, I promise.

1034
01:44:01,308 --> 01:44:03,276
You'll see, it's gonna be fine.

1035
01:44:03,310 --> 01:44:04,946
No, Sally!

1036
01:44:04,979 --> 01:44:06,514
Sal, it's gonna be okay.

1037
01:44:06,547 --> 01:44:08,516
Sally! Please!

1038
01:44:11,418 --> 01:44:13,888
No!

1039
01:44:16,791 --> 01:44:20,460
Dennis, stop! Stop! Don't!

1040
01:44:23,798 --> 01:44:24,999
Leila!

1041
01:44:31,539 --> 01:44:32,807
Leila!

1042
01:45:00,134 --> 01:45:02,335
Leila. Leila.

1043
01:45:06,974 --> 01:45:08,910
Sally?

1044
01:45:08,943 --> 01:45:10,477
Come on, Sal!

1045
01:45:13,114 --> 01:45:14,481
Come on, Sal!

1046
01:45:14,515 --> 01:45:16,050
Fly away with me.

1047
01:45:18,019 --> 01:45:20,420
Come fly away with me.

1048
01:45:20,453 --> 01:45:21,956
We'll go to Mars...

1049
01:45:21,989 --> 01:45:26,093
Saturn, and we'll go
to Jupiter and China.

1050
01:45:26,127 --> 01:45:28,863
Anywhere but here. We
get the hell outta here.

1051
01:45:33,433 --> 01:45:35,870
We're just a couple of kids.

1052
01:45:35,903 --> 01:45:38,105
Kids... Sal?

1053
01:45:38,139 --> 01:45:39,406
No, Dennis.

1054
01:45:40,107 --> 01:45:41,474
They are kids.

1055
01:45:42,677 --> 01:45:44,512
Not us.

1056
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:47,882
How much you sell 'em for?

1057
01:45:47,915 --> 01:45:50,417
- No.
- How much a job?

1058
01:45:50,450 --> 01:45:52,119
- No.
- How many times a day?

1059
01:45:52,153 --> 01:45:54,088
No, you-you got it all wrong.

1060
01:45:54,121 --> 01:45:55,890
Sal, I do it for
you. I do it for you!

1061
01:45:55,923 --> 01:45:58,059
- No!
- I... Everything I do...

1062
01:46:04,532 --> 01:46:05,967
I want you to tell me...

1063
01:46:07,535 --> 01:46:10,605
what-what that girl does
for you that I don't do.

1064
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:14,742
What do you owe her?

1065
01:46:14,775 --> 01:46:16,644
She doesn't owe me anything.

1066
01:46:39,634 --> 01:46:40,735
Sal...

1067
01:46:42,536 --> 01:46:43,871
Hey, Sal.

1068
01:47:14,902 --> 01:47:16,503
Let's get you in the car.

1069
01:47:16,537 --> 01:47:17,705
Watch your head, all right?

1070
01:47:22,009 --> 01:47:23,010
Hey.

1071
01:47:30,885 --> 01:47:32,119
Worried about him?

1072
01:47:36,190 --> 01:47:37,825
Never gonna stop.

1073
01:47:40,294 --> 01:47:42,530
Well, if we can get
him to help us...

1074
01:47:44,031 --> 01:47:46,033
maybe we can catch the big guy.

1075
01:47:48,903 --> 01:47:51,706
Promise you'll take
care of those kids.

1076
01:47:51,739 --> 01:47:55,710
Oh, don't worry.
I'll see to them.

1077
01:47:55,743 --> 01:47:57,678
That's what gets me
up in the morning.

1078
01:48:03,818 --> 01:48:08,923
Well, you... probably
better get going.

1079
01:48:08,956 --> 01:48:10,758
Local police are on their way.

1080
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:14,662
We have your statement, so...

1081
01:48:20,668 --> 01:48:22,036
Have a nice ride.

1082
01:48:40,254 --> 01:48:42,123
You know, we're gonna
get in trouble for this.

1083
01:48:43,224 --> 01:48:45,159
I'm gonna get in
trouble for this.

1084
01:48:45,192 --> 01:48:46,694
You didn't know shit about it.

1085
01:48:48,029 --> 01:48:50,498
It's not your fault
if I went rogue.

1086
01:48:54,335 --> 01:48:56,070
You're still an asshole.

1087
01:49:00,074 --> 01:49:01,175
To you.

1088
01:49:17,091 --> 01:49:18,225
Seatbelt?
