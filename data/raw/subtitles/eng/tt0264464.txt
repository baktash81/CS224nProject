JOE GARAGIOLA:
Thank you very much

23
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,700
and welcome
to To Tell the Truth.

24
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,600
Our first guest,
he's made a career

25
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,700
out of being
the most outrageous impostor

26
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,800
that we've ever come across
on this show

27
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,700
and you're going to see
what I mean.

28
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,000
ANNOUNCER:
Number One

29
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,600
what is your name, please?

30
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,500
My name is
Frank William Abagnale.

31
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,800
Number Two?

00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,100
My name is

33
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,500
Number Three?

34
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,600
My name is
Frank William Abagnale.

35
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,200
GARAGIOLA:
"From 1964 to 1967

36
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,900
"I successfully impersonated

37
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,500
"an airline pilot
for Pan Am Airways

38
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,800
"and I flew over
two million miles for free.

39
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,500
"During that time, I was also
the chief resident pediatrician

40
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,400
"at a Georgia hospital

41
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,400
"and an assistant
attorney general

42
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,200
"for the State of Louisiana.

43
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,600
"By the time I was caught,
I was considered

44
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,600
"the youngest and most daring
con man in U.S. history.

45
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,000
"I had cashed almost $4 million
in fraudulent checks

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,400
"in 26 foreign countries
and all 50 states.

47
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,700
"And I did it all
before my 19th birthday.

48
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,800
My name is
Frank William Abagnale."

49
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
( applause )

50
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,800
So, for the first time

51
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,400
he's going to have
to tell the truth

52
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,300
and we're going to start
our questioning with Kitty.

53
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,500
Thank you. Number One,
why, with all your talent--

54
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,900
and you're obviously
a very bright fellow--

55
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,600
why didn't you go in
for a legitimate profession?

56
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,100
It was really a question
of dollars and cents.

57
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,400
When I was a young man,
I needed the money

58
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,600
and I thought
this list of careers

59
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,000
was the easiest way to get it.

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I see.

61
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,800
Number Two, I find this all
very fascinating.

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,700
Who was it
that finally caught you?

63
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,100
His name was Carl Hanratty.

64
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,100
( French accent ):
Han-an-an-ratty.

65
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,300
Ratty.

66
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,800
( American accent ):
Hanratty.

67
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
Han-ratty.

68
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,100
Carl Hanratty.

69
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,500
-Yes.
-I...

70
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,100
am... Carl Hanratty.

71
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,500
I represent the FBI from
the United States of America.

72
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,100
( speaking French )

73
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,900
Yeah. I have orders

74
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,900
to see the American
prisoner, Abagnale.

75
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,700

English into French )

( thunder rumbling outside )

82
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,200
You sit here.

83
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,000
You do not open the door.

84
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,700
You do not pass him...

85
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,100
anything through the hole.

86
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,500
( wind quietly blowing
through building )

87
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,300
( speaking French )

88
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,700
( men conversing
indistinctly )

89
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,700
( hoarse coughing )

90
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,700
Aw... Jesus.

91
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,700
( violent coughing )

92
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,300

( retching )

97
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,300
You know, I've got
a little bit of a cold myself.

98
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,100
-Frank...
-( coughing )

99
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,300
I'm here to read
the articles of extradition

100
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,800
according to the
European Court for Human Rights.

101

"Article One:
Extradition shall be granted

Help me.

Help me.

107

Frank... stop it.

108
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,200
Help me.

109
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,900
You don't think actually
you can fool me, do you?

110

( raspy coughing )

111
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,200

Stay with me.

Article Two:

"If the request for extradition

Frank?

Frank?

120
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,300
Goddamn it!

121
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,900
-Get me a doctor in here!

122
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,300

-Yes.

Doctor! Now!

00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,100
HANRATTY:
Don't sweat it, Frank.

125
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,100
We're going to get you
right to a doctor.

Frank, if you can
hear me, don't worry.

129
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,300
I'm going to take you
home in the morning.

130
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,600
Home in the morning, Frank.

( men conversing in French )

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,300
What are you doing?

133

Washing off the lice.

134
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,100
This man has to be on a plane
for America.

135
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,400
He has to see a doctor.

136
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,200
The doctor comes in tomorrow.

137
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,200
I have worked too long, too hard

138
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,300
for you to take this
away from me.

139
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,800
If he dies,
I'm holding you responsible.

140

( men shouting in French )

144
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,600
Ah, Frank.

00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,600
Okay, Carl...

154
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,700
let's go home.

155
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,300
MAN:
The New Rochelle Rotary Club

156
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,300
has a history
that goes back to 1919.

157
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,800
In all those years

158
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,700
we've only seen a handful
of deserving gentlemen

159
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,500
inducted as lifetime members.

160
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,600
It's an honor that, uh

161
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,400
that has seen 57 names enshrined
on the wall of honor

162
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,900
and tonight, we make it 58.

163
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,500
So please stand as I present
my very good friend

164
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,000

our pencils sharp...

( scattered chuckling )

166
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,200
and our pens in ink--

167
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,800
Frank William Abagnale.

168

( mike feedback whines )

170
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,400
I stand here humbled

171
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,600
by the presence
of Mayor Robert Wagner...

172
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,100

173
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,100

( whistling )

176
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,800
Most of all, I'm honored to see
my loving wife Paula...

177
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,200
...and my son, Frank Jr.--

178
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
Frank... Aw, stand up.
Come on--

179
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,800
( feedback whining ):
...sitting in the front row.

180
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
( laughter )

181
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,900
Two little mice fell
in a bucket of cream.

182
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:31,800
The first mouse quickly gave up
and drowned.

183
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,200
The second mouse...
wouldn't quit.

184
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,700
He struggled so hard

185
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,300
that eventually he churned
that cream into butter

186
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,200
and crawled out.

187
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,500
Gentlemen, as of this moment,
I am that second mouse.

188
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,400
( laughter and enthusiastic
applause )

189
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,700
( "Embraceable You" playing
on record player )

190
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,400
PAULA:
You're a better dancer
than your father, Frankie.

191
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,000
You hear that, Daddy?

192
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
FRANK SR.:
Like fun.

193
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,100
PAULA:
The girls don't know

194
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
what they're in for.

195
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,200
Show him the dance
you were doing when we met.

196
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,600
Ah, who can remember?

197
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,100
The people
in that little French village

198
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,100
were so happy to see Americans

199
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,400
they decided
to put on a show for us.

200
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,500
So they crammed 200 soldiers...

201
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,500
Yeah, we know the story, Daddy.

202
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,400
...into that tiny social hall

203
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,700
and the first person
to walk onstage

204
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,300
is your mother,
and she starts to dance.

205
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,500
You know, it had been months
since we'd even seen a woman

206
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,400
and here's this blonde angel.

207
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,800
Blonde bombshell.

208
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,700
( giggles )

209
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,000
And the men are literally
holding their breath.

210
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,600
Holding their breath for you.

211
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,700
You hear that?

212
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,700
( giggles )

213
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,700
Mm-hmm.

214
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,900
And I turned to my buddies
and I said...

215
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,100
"I will not leave France
without her."

216
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,400
And I didn't.

217
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,100
You didn't.

218
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,900
I didn't.

219
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
( liquid spills )

220
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,200
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, the rug!

221
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
Aw, Mom...

222
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,300
I can't believe I did that.

223
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,800
No, no, it's nothing.
It's nothing.

224
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,300
Oh, Frankie, Frankie,
get a towel.

225
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,400
-Yeah, yeah.
-Paula...

226
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,400
Come on.

227
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Dance with me, Paula.

228
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,100
Ah... ( giggles )

229
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,000
( instrumental interlude
playing )

230
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,800
Whenever I dance for you

231
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,800
I get in trouble.

232
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,900
( mouthing ):
Watch this.

233
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,100
( chuckles )

234
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,800
Oh! ( laughs )

235
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,800
Frank! Wake up.

236
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,800
Come on, let's go!

237
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,700
Get up. Come on, come on.

238
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,300
Frank, wake up.

239
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,300
( groans ):
Dad...

240
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,700
You don't have to go
to school today.

241
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,800
It's okay.

242
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,000
Why? Is it snowing?

243
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,500
Do you have a black suit?

244
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,800
I overslept again, huh?

245
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,900
We have a very important
meeting in the city.

246
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,800
Eat that.
Come on, come on, eat.

247
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,400
Ma'am, open up.
Just open up, please!

248
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,400
-Ma'am?
-It's important.

249
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,600
What?

250
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,200
Oh, gosh!

251
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,500
We don't open
for half an hour!

252
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,400
Open the door, please.
Just open the door.

253
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,400
It's important.

254
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,400
I-I'm sorry, we don't open
for half an hour.

255
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,500
What's your name, ma'am?

256
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,700
Darcy.

257
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,800
Darcy. That's a pretty name.

258
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,900
I'm in a bit of a fix.
I need a suit for my kid.

259
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,100
This is my son Frank.

260
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,100
Oh, hi.

261
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,100
He needs a black suit.

262
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,100
Black suit...

263
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,200
There was a death in the family.

264
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,000
My father, 85 years old,
war hero.

265
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yeah?

266
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,600
There's a funeral
this afternoon, military funeral

267
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,300
planes flying overhead,
21-gun salute.

268
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,300
Geez.

269
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,200
Frank needs to borrow a suit
for a couple of hours.

270
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,200
I'm sorry, we don't loan suits,
and we're not open.

271
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,600
Darcy... Darcy, please.

272
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,500
-( sighs )
-Come back.

273
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,700
Darcy... is this yours?

274
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,500
( jingles )

275
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,100
I just found it
in the parking lot.

276
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,200
Uh-huh.

277
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,600
It must've slipped
right off your neck.

278
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,400
( tires screeching )

279
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,500
Don't hit the curb.

280
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,400
( brakes squeaking )

281
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,300
Now get out,
walk around the back

282
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,100
and hold the door open for me.

283
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,900
( car horn honks )

284
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,900
All right.

285
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,100
What's next?

286
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,500
Okay, stop grinning.

287
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,900
When I get inside, you go back
to the front seat and wait.

288
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,500
Even if a cop comes
and writes you a ticket

289
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
you don't move the car,
understood?

290
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,500
Dad, wha-what's all this for?

291
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,600
You know why the Yankees
always win, Frank?

292
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,200
'Cause they have Mickey Mantle?

293
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,000
No, it's 'cause the other teams

294
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,400
can't stop staring
at those damn pinstripes.

295
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,400
Watch this.

296
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,300
The manager
of Chase Manhattan Bank

297
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,800
is about to open the door
for your father.

298
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,900
Mr. Abagnale, um

299
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,000
we don't usually
loan money to people

300
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,400
who have unresolved business
with the IRS.

301
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,200
That's a misunderstanding.

302
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,900
I hired the wrong guy
to do my books.

303
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,700
A mistake, I...
anybody could make it.

304
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,000
I just need you guys
to help me weather the storm.

305
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:16,500
Sir, you're being investigated
by the government for tax fraud.

306
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,600
My store is a landmark
in New Rochelle.

307
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,600
I have customers
all over New York.

308
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,300
Well, you're not a customer
at Chase Manhattan.

309
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,400
We don't know you.

310
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,200
I'm sure your bank
in New Rochelle

311
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,800
they know you,
they could help you out.

312
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,400
My bank went out of business.

313
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,300
Banks like this one put
them out of business.

314
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,500
Now, I know I made a mistake,
I admit that

315
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,000
but these people want blood.

316
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
They want my store.

317
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,900
They've threatened
to put me in jail.

318
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,600
( stammers )

319
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,100
This is America, right?

320
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
I'm not a criminal.

321
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,700
I'm a Medal of Honor winner

322
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,500
a lifetime member
of the New Rochelle Rotary Club.

323
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,500
All I'm asking is for you
to help me beat these guys.

324
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,100
It's not a question
of winning and losing.

325
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,600
It's a question of risk.

326
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,300
You're the largest bank
in the world.

327
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,900
Where's the fu...

328
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,700
Whe... Where's the risk?

329
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,800
Dad, how could you just let him
take our car like that?

330
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,900
He didn't take anything.
We took him.

331
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,000
He overpaid by $500.

332
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,300
Come on, Frank.

333
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,800
Let's return the suit.

334
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,800
( Paula sobbing )

335
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,100
This place is good.

336
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,100
It's small but, you know

337
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,600
it's going to be
a lot less work.

338
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,200
A lot less work for you.

339
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,100
(jackhammer drilling
in distance )

340
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,200
( keys clank )

341
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,700
FRANK:
Hey, Dad.

342
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,700
Hi.

343
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,300
Where's your mother?

344
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,000
I don't know.

345
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,200
She said something
about going to look for a job.

346
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,500
What's she gonna be

347
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,900
a shoe salesman
at a centipede farm?

348
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,000
( laughing )

349
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,600
( both laughing )

350
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,000
What are you doing?

351
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,600
( both laughing )

352
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,900
You want some pancakes?

353
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,900
For dinner?

354
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,800
On my son's 16th birthday?

355
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,900
We're not gonna eat pancakes.

356
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,100
Come on, why are you looking
at me like that?

357
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,400
You thought I forgot?

358
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,400
-I didn't think you forgot.
-I opened a checking account

359
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,300
in your name.

360
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,500
I put $25 in the account

361
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,800
so you can buy
whatever you want.

362
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,800
Don't tell your mother.

363
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,900
I won't.

364
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,000
Thanks, Dad.

365
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,100
Yep.

366
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,200
Didn't that bank turn you down
for a loan, though?

367
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,900
Yes, they all turned me down.

368
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,300
( chuckles )

369
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,600
Then why you opening
a banking account with them?

370
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,900
Well, because one day,
you'll want something

371
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,800
from these people--
a house, a car.

372
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,800
They have all the money.

373
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,500
There's 50 checks there, Frank

374
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,100
which means, from this day on...

375
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,300
you're in their little club.

376
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,800
I'm in their little club.

377
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,900
You got that, you got it all.

378
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,300
It's even got my name there,
huh?

379
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,600
To the moon.

380
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,600
-To the moon!
-To the moon.

381
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,700
( bells tolling )

382
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,900
See that? It's just a school.

383
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,600
No different than Westbourne.

384
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,500
Ma... you said you were
going to quit.

385
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,100
Frankie, you don't have
to wear the uniform here.

386
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,100
Why don't you take off
your jacket?

387
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,100
I'm used to it.

388
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
( indistinct conversation )

389
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,600
Excuse me.

390
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,600
Oh, yes?

391
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,500
Do you know
where room 17 French is?

392
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,300
GIRL:
Yeah, it's...

393
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,100
( snickering )

394
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,600
( school bell ringing )

395
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,500
BOY:
But you frickin' killed him.

396
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,000
( loud indistinct conversation )

397
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,200
You selling encyclopedias?

398
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,700
Yeah, he looks like
a substitute teacher.

399
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,000
( boy laughing )

400
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,400
( loud conversation
and laughter continues )

401
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,600
Quiet down, people!

402
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,900
My name is Mr. Abagnale!

403
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,200
That's Abagnale, not Abagnahlee

404
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,600
not Abagnaylee, but Abagnale!

405
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,800
Now, somebody please tell me
where you left off

406
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,900
in your textbooks.

407
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,000
Excuse me, people,
if I need to ask again

408
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,700
I'm going to write up
the entire class.

409
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,100
Take your seats!

410
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,800
Chapter seven.

411
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,200
Will you please open your
textbooks to, uh, chapter eight

412
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,900
and we'll get started?

413
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,400
Excuse me,
what's your name?

414
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,500
Brad.

415
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,900
Brad, why don't you get up here
in front of the class here

416
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,100
and read conversation
number five?

417
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,600
( pronouncing poorly ):
"Les Francais sonts

418
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,600
"uh, generalement

419
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,500
-"dans leur pais que...
-( students laughing )

420
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,400
presque tout le monde
a cette impression..."

421
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,800
They sent for me.

422
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,000
They said they needed a sub
for Roberta.

423
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,900
I came all the way
from-from Dixon.

424
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,400
Well, uh,
I always sub for Roberta.

425
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,200
Excuse me,
why aren't you reading?

426
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,400
( continues reading )

427
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,400
I'll never come back to-to
Bellarmine Jefferson again!

428
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,300
-You tell them not to call me!
-( students laughing )

429
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,400
What do they think,
it's easy for a woman my age

430
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,700
and all the money that it costs
to travel?

431
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,000
I tell you,
they don't give a damn.

432
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
( students laughing )

433
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,200
Mr. and Mrs. Abagnale

434
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,300
this is not a question
of your son's attendance.

435
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,500
I regret to inform you that,
for the past week

436
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,100
Frank has been teaching
Mrs. Glasser's French class.

437
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,700
He what?

438
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,900
Your son has been pretending
to be a substitute teacher

439
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:34,300
lecturing the students,
uh, giving out homework.

440
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,300
Mrs. Glasser has been ill
and there was

441
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,800
some confusion
with the real sub.

442
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,300
Your son held a teacher-parent
conference yesterday

443
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,800
and was planning
a class field trip

444
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,300
to a French bread factory
in Trenton.

445
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,900
Do you see the problem we have?

446
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,900
-Mrs. Davenport?
-Yeah.

447
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,500
Uh, I have a note to miss fifth
and sixth period today.

448
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,500
Doctor's appointment.

449
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,100
-One moment.
-( phone ringing )

450
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,900
I'll be right with you.

451
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,900
( whispering ):
Hey...

452
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,900
MRS. DAVENPORT:
Yes?

453
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,100
You should fold it.

454
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,200
What?

455
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,900
That note. It's a fake, right?

456
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,300
You should fold it.

457
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,100
It's... It's a note from my mom.

458
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,800
I have a doctor's appointment.

459
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,700
Yeah, but there's no crease
in the paper.

460
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,800
When your mom hands you a note
to miss school

461
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,000
the first thing you do is,
you fold it

462
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,900
and you put it in your pocket.

463
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,100
I mean, if it's real,
where's the crease?

464
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
-( school bell ringing )
-( door opens )

465
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,200
( quietly ):
Frankie.

466
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,300
( both chuckling quietly )

467
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,800
Ma, I'm home.

468
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,800
( romantic music
plays on record player )

469
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,800
Oh, you remember
that girl Joanna

470
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,000
I was telling you about?

471
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,200
I asked her out today.

472
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,500
Think we're going to go
to the Junior Prom.

473
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,500
( record scratches,
music stops )

474
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,400
Ma, is this
my driver's license?

475
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,200
That's all there is,
two bedrooms.

476
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,600
Oh, Frankie.

477
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,600
You remember Dad's friend?

478
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,500
Jack Barnes?

479
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,800
From the club.

480
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,800
Hello.

481
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,800
He came by looking
for your father.

482
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,600
I was giving him
a tour of the apartment.

483
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,700
It's very, uh, uh,
spacious, Paula.

484
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,500
Dad's at the store.

485
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,500
So, Frank...
you're getting to look

486
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,400
more like your old man
every day.

487
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,500
Thanks for the sandwich, Paula.

488
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,200
I'll see you later, eh?

489
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,300
Wait.

490
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,600
Is this yours?

491
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,300
Oh.

492
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,000
Well, thanks, Frank.

493
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,400
Uh, that's the President's pin.

494
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,800
I'd be in deep trouble
if I lost that.

495
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,800
( nervous chuckle )

496
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,000
I'll see you all later, eh?

497
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,700
Are you hungry, Frankie?

498
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,100
I'll make you a sandwich.

499
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,400
Jack wanted to talk business
with your father.

500
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,400
He thinks we should get a lawyer
and sue the government.

501
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,900
That is not legal,
what they're doing to us.

502
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Why aren't you saying anything?

503
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,100
You're not going to tell him...
are you?

504
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,800
( quietly ):
No.

505
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,100
That's right.

506
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,900
There's nothing to tell.

507
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,600
I'm going out for a few hours

508
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,700
to visit some old friends
from the tennis club and...

509
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,300
when I get home,
we'll all have dinner together.

510
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,300
Right?

511
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,400
But you won't say anything

512
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,900
because it's...
it's just silly, isn't it?

513
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,900
How could we sue anybody?

514
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:35,300
Oh... do you need
some money, Frankie?

515
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,100
A few dollars to buy
some record albums?

516
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,300
Here, take five dollars.

517
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,300
Or-Or ten.

518
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,800
You promised you were going
to quit.

519
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,900
( slams )

520
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,000
( children laughing )

521
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,600
( dog barking in distance )

522
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,500
Ma, I'm home!

523
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,500
( door opens )

524
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,900
Hey, hey!

525
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,200
You... You stay away from me,
hear me?

526
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,000
You stay away from me--
I don't know who you are

527
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,300
but if you ever
come back here again--

528
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,600
Frankie! Frank, Frank,
calm down, will you?

529
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,800
I'm Dick Kesner.

530
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,000
Now, I want you
to leave your things here

531
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,100
and follow me
into the next room, okay?

532
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,700
They're all waiting for you.

533
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,300
PAULA:
You don't have to be scared.

534
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,000
I'm right here, Frank.
I'll always be here.

535
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,700
But there are laws.

536
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,000
Everything in this country has
to be legal.

537
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
So what we need to do is
make some decisions.

538
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,700
That's what Mr. Kesner
is here for.

539
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,000
Many times these decisions
are left up to the courts

540
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,500
but that can be
very expensive, Frank

541
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,200
people fighting
over their children.

542
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,900
Nobody is fighting.

543
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,500
Look at me, Frank.
Nobody is fighting.

544
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,900
( speaking French )

545
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,200
( quietly ):
Dad, what's going on?

546
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,800
Dad, what's going on?

547
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,400
( speaking French continues )

548
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,100
Do you remember your grandma,
Eve?

549
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,800
She arrived this morning.

550
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,200
( speaks French )

551
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,800
Hello.

552
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,300
Do you understand what
we're saying to you, Frank?

553
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,900
Your father and I
are getting a divorce.

554
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,500
( speaking French )

555
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,700
Nothing's gonna change.

556
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,500
We're still gonna see
each other.

557
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,400
Stop it, please, Frank.
Don't interrupt.

558
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,800
Frank, you don't
have to read all of this.

559
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,600
Most of it's for your parents--
boring adult business--

560
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,400
but this paragraph right here,
this is important

561
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,400
because it states
who you're gonna live with...

562
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,400
after the divorce...

563
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,400
whose custody you will be in.

564
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,500
And there's a blank space
right here.

565
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,500
( Eve speaking French )

566
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,000
And I want you to go
into the kitchen

567
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,600
sit at the table

568
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,300
and put a name down.

569
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,700
You can take
as long as you want

570
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,300
but when you come back
into this room...

571
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,000
l want to see a name
on that line.

572
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,800
Frank, just write down a name
and this will all be over.

573
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,700
It's gonna be okay.

574
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,500
FRANK:
Dad, what name?

575
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,600
Your mother or your father.

576
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,800
Just put the name there.
It's as simple as that.

577
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,900
And don't look so scared.

578
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,600
It's not a test.

579
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,700
There's no wrong answer.

580
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,100
( man announcing trains
indistinctly )

581
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,500
( melancholy jazz playing )

582
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,500
Hi.

583
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,600
( panting )

584
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,200
One ticket to Grand Central,
please.

585
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,500
That'll be $3.50, sir.

586
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,300
Is it okay
if I write you a check?

587
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,200
Carl, when do I get
to call my father?

588
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,800
You can call him
when we get to New York.

589
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,100
We leave for the airport
in seven hours.

590
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,300
Until then, just sit there.

591
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,100
Be quiet.

592
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,500
You know, Carl,
on the other side of the hotel

593
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,400
they got suites
that face the park.

594
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,600
It's the best room
the FBI can afford.

595
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,100
It's okay, I've stayed in worse.

596
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,400
Mr. Mudrick...

597
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,800
Mr. Mudrick, please.
You have to listen.

598
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,600
I don't want to hear your story.

599
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,300
This is two checks that bounced.

600
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,100
You know how much trouble
I'm in?

601
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,100
No, but listen, I'm telling you,
the bank, they made the mistake.

602
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,600
I'll write you another check
right now!

603
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,600
What, do I look like
I was born yesterday?

604
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,400
Look, it's midnight,
Mr. Mudrick.

605
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,400
Where am I gonna go?

606
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,100
You're a goddamn kid.

607
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,100
Go home.

608
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,200
( baby crying in distance )

609
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,000
I mean, I hope you understand.

610
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,800
My boss sent me to Brooklyn,
then Queens.

611
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,300
Now he wants me in Long Island

612
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,800
to take a few clients out
for a night on the town.

613
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,700
I'm sorry, but we're not allowed
to cash checks from other banks.

614
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,600
How would we know
if they were any good?

615
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,400
What did you say your name was?

616
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,500
Ashley.

617
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,700
Ashley... you know what I found
on the sidewalk out there?

618
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,400
Must've slipped
right off your neck.

619
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,500
Is there something
I can help you with, son?

620
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,900
Well, you see, it's my
grandmother's birthday next week

621
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
and I want to get her
something extra-special.

622
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,800
Please, l mean

623
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,200
it's my midterm next week
and my books were stolen.

624
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,300
( raspy coughing )

625
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,300
please, it's just five dollars.

626
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,900
No one would have to know.

627
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,500
I'm sorry,
but we are not allowed

628
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,900
to take checks
from people we don't know.

629
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
( horns honking,
whistle blowing )

630
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,400
( women laughing )

631
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,500
Pleasure to have you back,
Captain Carlson.

632
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,000
What do you think, Angelo?

633
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,600
The tomatoes are ripe
this afternoon.

634
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,600
( women giggling )

635
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,700
Well, what have we here?

636
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,700
-Can I have your autograph?
-You betcha.

637
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,800
-Can I have your autograph, too?
-You gonna be a pilot?

638
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,900
-Mm-hmm!
-All right, then.

639
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,500
There you go.
Work hard in school.

640
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,800
FRANK:
DearDad:

641
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,400
l have decided to become
an airline pilot.

642
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,800
l have applied
to all the big airlines

643
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,900
and l have several
promising interviews lined up.

644
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,700
How's Mom?

645
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,700
Have you called herlately?

646
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,800
Love, yourson, Frank.

647
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,000
Hello.

648
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,300
I'm Frank Black
from Murrow High School

649
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,900
and I have an appointment
with Mr. Morgan.

650
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,200
You're the young man

651
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,200
who's writing the article
for the school paper.

652
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,700
Yes, ma'am, that's me.
I want to know

653
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,700
everything there is to know
about being a pilot.

654
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,000
What airports
does Pan Am fly to?

655
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,000
What does a pilot make
in a year?

656
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,500
And who tells them
where they're gonna fly to?

657
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.

658
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,900
Just take 'em one at a time.

659
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,100
All right. What does it mean

660
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,700
when one pilot says
to another pilot:

661
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,200
"What kind of equipment
are you on?"

662
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,800
They just want to know what kind
of aircraft you're flying:

663
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,200
Is it a DC-8, 707,
Constellation?

664
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,900
And what about those I.D. badges
that I've seen pilots wear?

665
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,100
Well, every pilot has to have
two things with him

666
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,300
at all times: One is
his airline personnel badge--

667
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,300
looks just like this one here,
from Pan Am--

668
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,900
the other one is
their FAA license...

669
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,300
and that looks just like this.

670
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,700
Oh. Sir, do you think I can
make a copy of this

671
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,900
to put into my article?

672
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,700
Oh, Frank,
you can have that one.

673
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,100
It's three years expired.

674
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,700
Aw, thanks!
And what about your I.D. badge?

675
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,200
You have an extra one
I could borrow?

676
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,300
Oh, no, I can't help you there.

677
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,200
Those are special-ordered
from Polaroid.

678
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,700
The only way
to get one of those

679
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,400
is to become a real live pilot
for Pan American Airways.

680
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,200
( dialing phone )

681
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,200
( car horns honking,
whistle blowing )

682
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,800
WOMAN ( overphone ):
Pan Am, may I help you?

683
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,300
FRANK ( Southern accent ):
Yeah, hello.

684
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,300
I'm calling about a uniform.

685
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,100
WOMAN:
Hold for Purchasing.

686
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,100
FRANK:
Thank you.

687
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,500
WOMAN 2:
Purchasing.

688
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,000
FRANK ( Southern accent ):
Hi. I'm a copilot

689
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,300
based out of San Francisco.

690
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,200
I flew a flight
into New York last night

691
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,200
but the problem is

692
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,300
I'm headed out to, uh, Paris
in three hours.

693
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,200
WOMAN 2:
How can we help you?

694
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,600
FRANK:
I sent my uniform

695
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,500
to be cleaned through the hotel

696
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,800
and I... I guess
they must have lost it.

697
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,400
WOMAN 2:
They lost a uniform.
Happens all the time.

698
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,400
Go down to the Well-Built
Uniform Company

699
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,500
at Ninth and Broadway.

700
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,000
They're our uniform supplier.

701
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,700
l'll tell Mr. Rosen
you're coming.

702
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,900
ROSEN:
You look too young
to be a pilot.

703
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,700
I'm a copilot.

704
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,300
Why so nervous?

705
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,200
How would you feel if you, uh

706
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,800
lost your uniform
first week on the job?

707
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,400
Relax.

708
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,000
Pan Am's got lots of uniforms.

709
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,300
It's gonna be $164.

710
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,600
Great. I'll, uh,
I'll write you a check.

711
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,700
Sorry, no checks, no cash.

712
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,900
You'll have to fill in
your employee I.D. number

713
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,000
and then I'll bill Pan Am.

714
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,000
They'll take it out
of your next paycheck.

715
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,900
Even better.

716
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,800
FRANK:
DearDad:

717
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,700
You always told me that an
honest man has nothing to fear.

718
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,800
So l'm trying my best
not to be afraid.

719
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,800
l'm sorry l ran away,
butyou don't have to worry.

720
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,900
l'm gonna get it all back
now, Daddy.

721
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,800
l promise.
l'm going to get it all back.

722
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,900
( approving murmur )

723
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,600
GIRL:
Are you a real live pilot?

724
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,800
I sure am, little lady.
What's your name?

725
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,800
Celine.

726
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,700
Celine, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

727
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,800
It's a pleasure
to meet you, too.

728
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,200
That's fifty, seventy

729
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,100
eighty, ninety,
one hundred dollars.

730
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,100
You have yourself a great time
in Paris.

731
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,700
I always do.

732
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,700
Excuse me.

733
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,200
I'm John Modiger.
I manage this branch.

734
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,800
I want to thank you
for coming in

735
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,800
and using our institution.

736
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,900
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you, John.

737
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,100
I'll be back again.

738
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,100
Good.

739
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,700
Have you stayed with us before?

740
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,000
Uh, no, I've been primarily
based on the West Coast.

741
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,400
Is it all right if I write you
a check for the room?

742
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,500
No problem, sir.

743
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,600
Great.

744
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,000
Uh...

745
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,100
I was also wondering

746
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,000
if I could write you
a personal check?

747
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,500
For airline personnel, we cash
personal checks up to $100.

748
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,500
Payroll checks
we cash up to $300.

749
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,700
Did you say $300
for a payroll check?

750
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,300
( typewriter keys clacking )

751
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,800
FRANK:
DearDad:

752
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,400
l've decided to become a pilot
forPan American Airways...

753
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,900
the most trusted name
in the skies.

754
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,100
They've accepted me
into their training program

755
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,100
and told me that ifl work hard

756
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,000
l should earn my wings
real soon.

757
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,700
Please get in touch with Joanna
Carlton from the tenth grade.

758
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,100
Tell herl'm sorry that l could
not take her to the Junior Prom.

759
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,100
Love, yourson, Frank.

760
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,100
Hello, how are you?

761
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,300
Fine, thank you.

762
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,300
I have a payroll check here
I'd like to cash.

763
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,000
Certainly.

764
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Thank you.

765
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,100
Uh, excuse me.

766
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,000
I'm sure you hear this
all the time

767
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,300
but you have the most
beautiful eyes I have ever seen.

768
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,600
Yeah, I do get that
all the time.

769
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,600
( nervous laugh )

770
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,200
How would you like it?

771
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,300
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

772
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,400
We won't have any cash until
the banks open in an hour

773
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,200
but, uh, I'm sure

774
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,400
they can cash your check
at the airport.

775
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,900
The airport?

776
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,300
Who cashes checks
at the airport?

777
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,400
Well, the airlines, sir.

778
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,900
They've always taken care
of their own.

779
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,800
(jet passing overhead )

780
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,600
( indistinct flight announcement
overP.A. )

781
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,500
Hello.

782
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,100
Hi. Are you deadheading?

783
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,900
What?

784
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,900
Are you my deadhead to Miami?

785
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,300
Mi...?

786
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,700
Yes, yes.

787
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,900
( laughs )

788
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,300
Yeah, I'm the deadhead.
Here you go.

789
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,900
You're a little late,
but the jump seat is open.

790
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,500
( chuckling ):
You know

791
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,100
it's been awhile
since I've done this.

792
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,600
Which one's the jump seat again?

793
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,100
( both laughing )

794
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,800
Have a nice flight.

795
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,000
Are you my deadhead?

796
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,200
STEWARDESS:
Frank, Captain Oliver.

797
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,900
-John Larkin, the copilot.
-Hello.

798
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,000
Fred Tulley, flight engineer.

799
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,200
Frank Taylor, Pan Am.

800
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,100
Thanks for giving me a lift,
boys.

801
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,900
Go ahead and take a seat, Frank.

802
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,100
We're about to push.

803
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,400
What kind of equipment you on,
DC-8?

804
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,100
Uh, 707.

805
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,800
You turning around
on the redeye?

806
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,900
Uh, I'm jumping puddles
for the next few months

807
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,800
trying to earn my keep
running leapfrogs

808
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,000
for the weak and weary.

809
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,100
No shame in that.
We all did it.

810
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,600
Have a seat.

811
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,700
Thank you.

812
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,100
Would you like a drink
after takeoff?

813
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,000
M-Milk?

814
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,200
OLIVER:
80 knots.

815
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,300
LARKIN:
Check.

816
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,700
V-one. Rotate.

817
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,700
(jet engines roaring )

818
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,800
V-two. Positive rate.

819
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,100
Gear up.

820
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,500
FRANK:
DearDad:

821
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,000
Today was graduation.

822
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,700
l am now a copilot

823
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:17,000
earning $1,400 a month
plus benefits

824
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
and the bestpart is

825
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,300
they tell me
my family can fly for free.

826
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,600
So tell Mom to pack herbags
and buy a new swimsuit

827
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,900
because l'm taking us all
to Hawaii for Christmas.

828
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,300
l love you, Dad.

829
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,300
Aloha, Frank.

830
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,900
Hello, deadhead.

831
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Hello.

832
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,600
Enjoying your free ride?

833
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,200
Marci...

834
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,200
did you drop this?

835
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,600
Must've slipped
right off your neck.

836
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,000
No...

837
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,600
( chuckling )

838
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,700
( giggling ):
No!

839
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,400
No...

840
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,100
MARCI:
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

841
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,600
( Frank moans passionately )

842
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,800
Yes!

843
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,700
( clanking and clattering )

844
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,800
( Marci panting )

845
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,900
Why are you stopping?

846
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,300
I want to tell you something,
Marci.

847
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:18,100
This is by far...

848
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:22,700
the best date I have ever
been on.

849
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,000
( laughing )

850
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,500
WOMAN:
I'd like to open a Money Market,
please.

851
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,500
Okay.

852
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,500
Welcome to Miami Mutual Bank.
How may I help you?

853
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,000
My name is Frank Taylor.
I'm a copilot for Pan Am.

854
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,800
I'd like to cash
this check here, and then

855
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,900
I'd like to take you out
for a steak dinner.

856
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,800
( laughing )

857
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,000
( teller giggling )

858
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,100
And then we feed the checks
into the MICR machine

859
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,400
which uses special ink

860
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,900
to encode the account numbers
on the bottom of the checks.

861
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,300
And where are these numbers?

862
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,600
They're, um... right here.

863
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,000
Right there?

864
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,100
See?

865
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,500
( both giggling )

866
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,600
They're called routing numbers.

867
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,800
So where do the checks
get routed to?

868
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,200
You know, I don't exactly know.

869
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,800
Nobody ever
asked me that before.

870
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,500
( both laughing )

871
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,200
AUCTIONEER:
Our next item up for bid

872
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,500
is also from the Jersey
Central Bank foreclosure.

873
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,700
This is a MICR encoder

874
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,400
a machine used
to encode bank checks.

875
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,700
Do I have an opening bid?

876
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,800
HANRATTY:
Our unknown subject
is a paperhanger

877
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,500
who started working
on the East Coast.

878
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,700
ln the last few weeks,
this unsub has developed

879
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,300
a new form of check fraud
which l'm calling "the float."

880
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,400
What he's doing is

881
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,400
he's opening checking accounts
at various banks

882
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,300
then changing the MICR ink
routing numbers

883
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,700
at the bottom of those checks.

884
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,900
Next slide, please.

885
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,100
( projector clanks )

886
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,100
Next slide, please.

887
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,600
Uh, the remote thing is broken.

888
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,100
You'll have to do it by hand.

889
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,300
You've gotta... try the...

890
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,800
Agent Mullen, it should be...

891
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,400
it should be the square button
just there by the side.

892
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,600
This carousel doesn't work.

893
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,100
It's a bad carousel
you got there.

894
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,200
Thank you, Agent Mullen.

895
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,400
Got to move it manually.

896
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,000
This is a map of the 12 banks
of the U.S. Federal Reserve.

897
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Slide.

898
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,100
( clicking )

899
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,600
MICR scanners at every bank

900
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,000
read these numbers
at the bottom of a check--

901
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,300
slide--

902
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:39,600
and then, ship that check off
to its corresponding branch.

903
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,400
Carl, for those of us who are
unfamiliar with bank fraud

904
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,200
you mind telling us
what the hell

905
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,200
you're talking about?

906
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:50,200
The East Coast branches are
numbered zero-one to zero-six.

907
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,200
The central branch
is zero-seven, zero-eight

908
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,400
so on, so forth.

909
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,000
You mean those numbers
on the bottom of a check

910
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,100
actually mean something?

911
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,500
All of this was in the report
I filed two days ago.

912
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,700
If you change...
a zero-two to a one-two

913
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,600
that means that check,
which was cashed in New York

914
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,300
does not go
to the New York Federal Branch

915
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,500
but it is rerouted

916
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,800
all the way to the San Francisco
Federal Branch.

917
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,700
The bank doesn't even know the
check has bounced for two weeks

918
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,700
which means our unsub can stay
in one place

919
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,400
paper the same city
over and over again

920
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,900
while his checks circle
the country.

921
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,300
You know,
you want to talk to my wife.

922
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,000
She's the one balances
the checkbook at our house.

923
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,800
( agents laughing )

924
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:33,000
Next slide.

925
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:38,700
( three-piece combo
plays soft jazz )

926
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,000
Daddy!

927
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,300
( chuckling )

928
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,800
My son, the birdman.

929
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:45,900
Some uniform, Frank.

930
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,900
What do you think?

931
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,500
Nice.

932
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,200
Sit down.

933
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,600
( clears throat )

934
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,400
So, Dad... Daddy, have you
gotten the postcards?

935
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,700
Of course.

936
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,000
This fork is ice cold.

937
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,700
No, no, Dad, th-that's
a chilled salad fork.

938
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:08,400
( whispering ):
It's a fancy restaurant,
you know.

939
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,700
( sighing )

940
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,200
Well, here...

941
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,100
I-I got you something.

942
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,800
What's that?

943
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,900
Open it.

944
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,700
You know what those are, right?

945
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,700
Those are the keys

946
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:31,200
to a 1965 Cadillac
DeVille convertible.

947
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,600
Brand-new, Dad.

948
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,500
Red with white interior

949
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,700
split seats,
air conditioning, the works.

950
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,000
Are you giving me a Cadillac?

951
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,700
Yeah. I'm giving you a Cadillac.

952
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,000
Dad, sh-she's parked downstairs.

953
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,400
When we're done eating lunch

954
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,900
why don't you, you know,
drive on over to Mom's house

955
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,100
pick her up,
take a little joyride?

956
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:54,200
Do you know what would happen
if the IRS found out

957
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,700
I was driving around
in a new coupe?

958
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,000
I took the train here, Frank.

959
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,200
I'm taking the train home.

960
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,900
All right.

961
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:14,200
I have plenty of money.

962
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,600
You know, if you
ever, ever need anything...

963
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,900
You worried?

964
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,200
About me?

965
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,100
No, I'm not... I'm not worried.

966
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:24,300
You think I can't buy
my own car?

967
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:29,100
Two mice fell
in a bucket of cream, Frank.

968
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,000
Which one am I?

969
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,700
You're that second mouse.

970
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:39,100
I went by the store today.

971
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,000
I had to close the store
for awhile.

972
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,500
It's all about timing, Frank.

973
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,300
The goddamn government
knows that.

974
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,900
They hit you when you're down.

975
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,800
I wasn't going to let them
take it from me, so I just...

976
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,700
shut the doors myself,
called their bluff.

977
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,600
Sooner or later,
they'll forget about me.

978
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,100
I understand, I...

979
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:04,300
Have you told Ma?

980
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:10,500
She's so stubborn, your mother.

981
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,700
Don't worry.

982
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:17,000
I'm not going to let her go
without a fight.

983
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,400
I been fighting for us...

984
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,800
( gasps quietly )

985
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,600
Dad?

986
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,500
...since the day we... we met.

987
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,700
Daddy, out of all those men

988
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,900
you were the one that
took her home, remember that.

989
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:36,800
200 men, sitting in
that tiny social hall

990
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,300
watching her dance.

991
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,300
What was the name of that town?

992
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,600
Montrichard, Dad.

993
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,100
Yeah.

994
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,000
I didn't speak a word of French

995
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:52,400
and six weeks later,
she was my wi...

996
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,400
She's your wife.

997
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:59,700
My son bought me
a Cadillac today.

998
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:03,700
I think that calls for a toast.

999
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,100
( soft jazz playing )

1000
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:11,300
( inhaling deeply )

1001
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,600
To the best damn pilot
in the sky.

1002
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,300
It's not what you think.

1003
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,000
I'm just a copilot.

1004
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:22,500
You see these people staring
at you?

1005
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,700
These are
the most powerful people

1006
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,300
in New York City

1007
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,600
and they keep peeking
over their shoulders

1008
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,600
wondering where
you're going tonight.

1009
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,500
Where you going, Frank?

1010
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,700
Dad, nobody's staring at me.

1011
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,900
Some place exotic?

1012
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,700
Just tell me where you're going.

1013
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,800
Los An... Hollywood.

1014
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,300
Hollywood.

1015
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,200
( sniffles )

1016
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,400
( whispering ):
The rest of us...

1017
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,100
really are suckers.

1018
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,700
So, I got on this red dress
and these high heels, right?

1019
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,500
And I got a bra,
like, out here, okay?

1020
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,500
And I'm chasing
these two Puerto Rican guys

1021
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,900
through the park.

1022
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:17,200
They got a suitcase filled
with bank robbery loot.

1023
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,000
Okay, I'm screaming out,
"FBI, freeze!"

1024
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:21,900
And I'm reaching for my gun,
but I can't find it in the bra.

1025
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:22,900
It's so damn big

1026
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,500
I thought I was going
to shoot my tits off.

1027
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,800
( laughing )

1028
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,800
You know, that's a funny story.

1029
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,500
People always laugh
at that story.

1030
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,400
Let me ask you a question,
Mr. Amdursky.

1031
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,500
If you were having
so much fun undercover

1032
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,200
why did you transfer
to bank fraud?

1033
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,200
I didn't transfer.

1034
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,300
I was censured
and reassigned.

1035
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,700
It's like being punished.
I was punished.

1036
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,200
I screwed up in the field.

1037
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,900
What about you, Mr. Fox?

1038
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,900
Were you... punished
for screwing up in the field?

1039
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,600
Oh, no, no, no, I've never
worked in the field before.

1040
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,200
I audited
background investigations

1041
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,400
of Department of Justice
clerical applicants.

1042
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,800
Well, that's just great.

1043
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,100
I ask for a team

1044
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:59,200
and they drag the bottom
of the Pacific.

1045
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,800
You mind if I ask you
a question, Agent Hanratty?

1046
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,900
How come you're so serious
all the time?

1047
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,300
Does it bother you,
Mr. Amdursky?

1048
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,900
Yeah. Yeah, it does bother me.

1049
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,400
Does it bother you, Mr. Fox?

1050
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,000
A little, I guess.

1051
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,800
Well, would you like
to hear me tell a joke?

1052
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,700
Yeah. Yeah, we'd love
to hear a joke from you.

1053
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,800
Knock, knock.

1054
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,500
Who's there?

1055
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:30,700
Go fuck yourselves.

1056
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,200
( swing music playing
on car radio )

1057
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,600
MAN:
He cashed three checks.

1058
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,100
They all cleared.

1059
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,100
I was going to deposit
this one today.

1060
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:51,100
I don't want any trouble.

1061
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:53,800
No trouble.

1062
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,500
No trouble at all.

1063
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,300
We'll just take this check
and be on our way.

1064
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,300
Thank you.

1065
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,400
Good.

1066
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,900
Because I don't want
my customers harassed.

1067
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,100
What are you saying,
he's still here?

1068
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,400
201 .

1069
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,500
Thank you.

1070
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,200
Corner here.

1071
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,300
Oh, thanks, son.

1072
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,500
Some steps.

1073
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,300
Steps.

1074
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,800
Hey, Mr. Murphy, how are you?

1075
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,000
Is that Frank?

1076
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Yeah, it's Frank.

1077
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,200
Hey, Frank, how are you?

1078
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,300
How's the knee?

1079
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,700
Come on,
I'll race you right now.

1080
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,800
( chuckling ):
Take care.

1081
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,400
Okay, Frank.

1082
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,500
AMDURSKY:
"Eyeball the back"?

1083
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,200
Come on, Carl,
this guy's a pen and ink man.

1084
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,200
A goddamn paperhanger.

1085
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,300
He doesn't even carry a gun.

1086
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,600
Why can't we go with you, Carl?

1087
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,400
You just keep your eyes open,
do your job

1088
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,700
and I'll buy you both
a Good Humor bar.

1089
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,500
( grunts )

1090
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,200
( gasps )

1091
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,400
It's all right, ma'am. FBI.

1092
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,700
( whimpers )

1093
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,700
201 ... 201 , 201 .

1094
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,500
201 ...

1095
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:08,900
201 ... 201 ... 201 ... 201 ...

1096
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,900
( anxious breathing )

1097
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,800
( music building dramatically )

1098
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,400
FBI!

1099
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,100
( crunching )

1100
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,400
( toilet flushing )

1101
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,100
FBI!

1102
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,200
Come out of the bathroom!

1103
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:30,400
Step out of the bathroom!

1104
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,500
Hands on your head.

1105
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,400
Oh, that's the new
IBM Selectric.

1106
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,600
Put your hands on your head.

1107
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,100
You can change the print type
in five seconds.

1108
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,500
-Shut up!
-Just pop out the ball.

1109
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,400
Put your hands on your head!
Put your hands...!

1110
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,400
You know, he's got over 200
checks here, a gallon

1111
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,300
-of India ink, drafting.
-Hands on your head!

1112
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,000
Even has
little payroll envelopes

1113
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,200
addressed to himself
from Pan Am.

1114
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,200
Put it down! Drop it!

1115
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,200
Relax.

1116
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,100
You're late, all right?

1117
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:55,600
My name's Allen, Barry Allen

1118
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,000
United States Secret Service.

1119
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,500
Your boy just tried
to jump out the window.

1120
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,800
My partner has him
in custody downstairs.

1121
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,100
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1122
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,200
You think the FBI
are the only ones on this guy?

1123
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,300
I mean, come on.

1124
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,200
Come on, he's dabbling
in government checks here.

1125
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,200
We've been following
a paper trail on this guy

1126
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:11,800
for months now.

1127
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:14,300
Hey, you mind taking that gun
out of my face?

1128
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,500
please. Really.

1129
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,700
I mean, it makes me nervous.

1130
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,500
Let me see some credentials.

1131
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,800
Yeah, sure.

1132
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,300
Take my whole wallet.

1133
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,800
( clears throat )

1134
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,000
You want my gun, too?

1135
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,700
Come over here. Take my gun.

1136
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,800
Hey, hey, look,
just do me a favor.

1137
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,400
Take a look outside. Look.

1138
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,500
Look out the window.

1139
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,900
My partner's walking him
to the car as we speak-- Look.

1140
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,700
Old guy almost pissed
in his pants

1141
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:41,500
when I came through the door.

1142
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,300
He jumped
right through the window

1143
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:44,600
onto the hood of my car.

1144
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,700
Hey, Murph?

1145
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,500
-Yeah?
-Call the LAPD again.

1146
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,000
I don't want people walking
through my crime scene.

1147
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,100
( raspy cough )

1148
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,600
I didn't expect
the Secret Service on this.

1149
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:56,800
Don't worry about it.

1150
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,000
( clears throat )

1151
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,300
Well, what's your name?

1152
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:02,800
Hanratty, Carl Hanratty.

1153
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,400
( sighs )

1154
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,000
Mind if I see
some identification?

1155
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:10,600
Sure.

1156
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:14,100
You never can be too careful
these days.

1157
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,600
Well, tough luck, Carl.

1158
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,500
Five minutes earlier

1159
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,100
you would've landed yourself
a pretty good collar.

1160
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,200
It's all right.

1161
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,200
Ten seconds later,
and you'd have been shot.

1162
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:25,100
Mind if I come downstairs
with you?

1163
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,200
I-I got to take a look
at this guy.

1164
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,300
Sure thing.

1165
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,200
Just, uh, do me a favor
and sit tight for a second

1166
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,500
while I get
this evidence downstairs.

1167
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,700
You know, I don't want
some maid walking through here

1168
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:34,700
and making the bed.

1169
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:35,700
LAPD should be here any sec.

1170
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:36,900
Wait.

1171
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,300
Your wallet.

1172
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,200
You hang onto it for a minute.

1173
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,200
I trust you.

1174
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,800
( sighs )

1175
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:56,500
( exhaling )

1176
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,200
( groans )

1177
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,300
Oh...

1178
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:03,200
( chuckling )

1179
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,700
Yeah...

1180
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,700
Secret Service.

1181
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,200
( ominous music begins )

1182
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,700
( music building )

1183
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,500
Hey!

1184
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,700
Oh, goddamn it!

1185
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:56,200
It was stupid.

1186
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:57,700
I made a stupid mistake.

1187
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,800
Forget about it.

1188
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,300
There are hundreds
of unknown subjects out there.

1189
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:03,800
I-I can get this guy, Sean.

1190
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:07,100
The worst thing a paperhanger
can do is show his face.

1191
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,200
I read the report.

1192
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,600
Six feet tall, brown hair,
27 to 30 years of age

1193
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,800
160 pounds.

1194
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,100
This could be almost anybody.

1195
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,400
I heard his voice, Sean,
I saw his face.

1196
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,100
There's nothing for him
to hide behind anymore.

1197
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,600
Just be careful.

1198
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,300
You got 12 years in.

1199
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,100
Nobody bothers you
down on the first floor.

1200
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,100
You practically wrote the book
on bank fraud.

1201
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,600
That's the kind of thing

1202
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,600
that can make you
section chief someday.

1203
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:33,300
Just don't put yourself
in this type of position.

1204
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,700
What type of position?

1205
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:39,200
Position of being humiliated.

1206
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,900
Sean, would you like
to hear me tell a joke?

1207
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,900
Yeah, sure.

1208
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:56,000
( pointedly ):
Knock, knock!

1209
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:01,400
FRANK:
So, my-my next question is,
when a pilot retires

1210
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,900
uh, Pan Am sends them
a check every single month?

1211
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,900
Uh, yeah, pension program
sends a check and benefits.

1212
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,400
How much is that check for?

1213
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:13,000
Uh, kid, I'm really not
in the mood for this right now.

1214
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:14,600
This Skywayman's
driving me crazy.

1215
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,000
Who's the Skywayman?

1216
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Ah, some nut that's flying
around the country

1217
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,200
posing as a Pan Am pilot.

1218
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:23,100
There's a column about him
in the paper today.

1219
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,600
I keep telling them
this is not my problem.

1220
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,600
This guy
doesn't even fly Pan Am.

1221
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,900
Flies everybody else.

1222
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,600
Flies United, TWA,
Continental, Eastern...

1223
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,100
( whispering ):
The Skywayman.

1224
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:41,400
Newspaper loves this clown.

1225
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,800
They call him
"the James Bond of the sky."

1226
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:47,600
( chuckles )

1227
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:48,700
Did you say...?

1228
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,500
Bond, James Bond.

1229
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,400
( "007" theme playing )

1230
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,300
BOND:
Tell me, Joan,
why does he do it?

1231
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,800
WOMAN:
He likes to win.

1232
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:04,800
MAN:
Come on, come on.

1233
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,300
WOMAN:
We'll be landing
in 20 minutes.

1234
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,200
Do you want to play it easy
or the hard way?

1235
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,200
And this isn't a tranquilizer.

1236
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,500
Well, Pussy, you do know a lot
more about planes than guns.

1237
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,800
( imitating Sean Connery ):
Hello, Pussy.

1238
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,700
( normal voice ):
Now, you're sure

1239
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:20,100
this is the suit, right?

1240
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:21,200
Positive.

1241
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,100
It's the exact suit he wore
in the movie.

1242
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,100
( Connery voice ):
Okay. I'll take three.

1243
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,700
Certainly, Mr. Fleming.

1244
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,100
Now what you need is
one of those

1245
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:32,100
little foreign sports cars
that he drives.

1246
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,700
( "007" theme playing )

1247
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:37,300
( engine rewing )

1248
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,900
( final "007" chord strikes )

1249
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:00,300
Hello.

1250
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:01,600
Hi.

1251
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:06,900
Haven't I seen you before?

1252
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,300
Maybe.

1253
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:14,100
A couple years ago, I was
on the cover of Seventeen.

1254
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,600
Yeah.

1255
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,100
You're that model, right?

1256
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,300
Cheryl.

1257
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:19,400
Yes.

1258
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:22,800
The guys used to put
your picture on their lockers.

1259
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:27,400
Isn't that your silver car
I saw parked out front?

1260
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,800
Yeah. One of them.

1261
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,400
So, think I could get
an autograph?

1262
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,600
Do you have a pen in your room?

1263
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,700
( rhythmic mechanical thumping )

1264
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,700
Shh.

1265
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:26,000
Man like you can buy
anything he wants.

1266
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,200
He buys a deck of cards
at the hotel gift shop.

1267
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,000
Well, you want
to see a card trick?

1268
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,500
How much did these cards cost?

1269
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,800
Oh, 55 cents, I think.

1270
01:00:55,400 --> 01:01:01,400
And if they sold me downstairs
at the hotel gift shop...

1271
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:04,000
how much would you pay?

1272
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:06,200
I'm sor...

1273
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:10,000
I'm sorry, how mu...
how much would I pay for what?

1274
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,600
( romantic instrumental music
playing )

1275
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:16,100
The entire night.

1276
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:20,900
How much would you pay me
for the entire night?

1277
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:27,900
Cheryl, I...
I really don't know.

1278
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:32,100
Don't be scared.

1279
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:38,100
Make me an offer.

1280
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:47,200
$300?

1281
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,100
Go fish.

1282
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,500
( sheepish chuckle )

1283
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:55,100
Uh, $500?

1284
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,000
Go fish.

1285
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
( chuckles )

1286
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,600
$600.

1287
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,000
( both chuckling )

1288
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,400
Go fish.

1289
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,400
( saxophone playing sexy riff )

1290
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,500
$1 ,000.

1291
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:11,200
Okay.

1292
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:15,300
$1 ,000.

1293
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:18,100
Okay.

1294
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,600
I'll be right back.

1295
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,600
Wait a second.
Where are you going?

1296
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:24,800
I'm going downstairs
to cash a check.

1297
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:28,500
You think this hotel is going
to cash a $1 ,000 check

1298
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,900
at 3:00am?

1299
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:34,800
It's a New York Savings and Loan
check.

1300
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,000
It's like gold.

1301
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,100
They'll cash it.

1302
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:40,100
Don't you think they might get
a little suspicious?

1303
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:41,100
Let me see that.

1304
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:43,800
It's a cashier's check.

1305
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,500
Endorse it over to me.

1306
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,400
No. I couldn't do that.

1307
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,800
See, this check is for $1 ,400.

1308
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:52,400
We agreed upon $1 ,000.

1309
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:59,000
Why don't I give you back $400
and you give me that check?

1310
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,700
Even better.

1311
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,600
( saxophone continues melody )

1312
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:36,000
Does this belong to anybody?

1313
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
( phone ringing )

1314
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:53,800
This is Hanratty.
Merry Christmas.

1315
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:55,300
FRANK:
Hello, Carl.

1316
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,100
Hello.

1317
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:01,700
Barry Allen, Secret Service.

1318
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:04,400
I've been trying
to track you down now

1319
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,500
for the last couple of hours.

1320
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:07,700
What do you want?

1321
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:11,200
I wanted to apologize
for what happened

1322
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,700
out in Los Angeles.

1323
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:13,800
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

1324
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:15,900
No, no,
you don't apologize to me.

1325
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,600
Do you always work
on Christmas Eve, Carl?

1326
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,200
I volunteered

1327
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:23,200
so men with families
could go home early.

1328
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,300
Looked like you were wearing
a wedding ring

1329
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,400
out in Los Angeles.

1330
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,100
I thought maybe
you had a family.

1331
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:31,500
No. No family.

1332
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,500
You want to talk to me...

1333
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,500
let's talk face-to-face.

1334
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:36,900
All right.

1335
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,000
I'm at my suite at the
Stuyvesant Arms, room 31 13.

1336
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,100
In the morning, I leave
for Las Vegas for the weekend.

1337
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:49,200
You think you're going
to get me again?

1338
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,000
You're not going to Vegas.

1339
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
You're not
in the Stuyvesant Arms.

1340
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:54,700
You'd love for me

1341
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:57,100
to send out 20 agents
Christmas Eve

1342
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:59,900
we barge into your hotel,
knock down the door

1343
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:02,100
so you can make fools
out of us all.

1344
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,600
I'm really sorry
if I made a fool out of you.

1345
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,700
I really am.

1346
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:06,800
Uh-uh, no.

1347
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,100
No, listen, I really am.

1348
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,500
No, no, you-you do not
feel sorry for me.

1349
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,800
The truth is,
I knew it was you.

1350
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:15,400
Now maybe I didn't get the cuffs
on you, but I knew.

1351
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:19,600
Ah, people only know
what you tell them, Carl.

1352
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:23,200
Well, then tell me this,
Barry Allen, Secret Service.

1353
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,500
How did you know
I wouldn't look in your wallet?

1354
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:29,100
The same reason
the Yankees always win.

1355
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:32,300
Nobody can keep their eyes
off the pinstripes.

1356
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:35,600
The Yankees win
because they have Mickey Mantle.

1357
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,900
No one ever bets on the uniform.

1358
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,100
( Frank chuckles )

1359
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,000
You sure about that, Carl?

1360
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,200
I'll tell you what I am sure of.

1361
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:45,200
You're going to get caught.

1362
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,300
One way or another,
it's a mathematical fact.

1363
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:49,800
It's-It's like Vegas.

1364
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,200
The House always wins.

1365
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:00,600
Well, Carl, I'm sorry,
but I have to go.

1366
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:03,600
Ah. You didn't call
just to apologize, did you?

1367
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:04,800
( laughing )

1368
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,200
What do you mean?

1369
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,200
You... you...
you have no one else to call.

1370
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,300
( laughing )

1371
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,000
Oh, ho, ho.

1372
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,500
( phone bell dings )

1373
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,100
( guffaws )

1374
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:21,400
( humming )

1375
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:29,800
( melancholy melodyplaying )

1376
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:35,700
( melody fades )

1377
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:37,300
You got that burger up?

1378
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:38,400
Yep.

1379
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:41,400
( "He's So Fine"
playing on radio )

1380
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,400
-Hi.
-Hi!

1381
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,700
How are you?

1382
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:49,700
More coffee, sir?

1383
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:57,500
Are you a collector?

1384
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:58,900
Of what?

1385
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
"Captives of the Cosmic Ray,"
"The Big Freeze"

1386
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:02,700
"Land of the Golden Giants."

1387
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:03,700
I've got them all.

1388
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:06,200
What are you talking about?

1389
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:08,300
Barry Allen.

1390
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,800
The Flash.

1391
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,400
Wait, kid, kid, kid.

1392
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,100
You mean like the comic book?

1393
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:20,200
Yeah, the comic book.

1394
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,400
When he's not The Flash.

1395
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:22,900
That's his name, Barry Allen.

1396
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:25,400
Thank you.

1397
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:32,200
Now get this:
He reads comic books.

1398
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:35,000
Comic books!
Barry Allen is The Flash!

1399
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:36,600
FOX:
Carl, slow down. Slow down.

1400
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,900
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

1401
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:39,500
He's a kid.
Our unsub is a kid.

1402
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,400
That's why we couldn't match
his prints.

1403
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,200
That's why he doesn't have
a record.

1404
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,700
Now, I want you to contact NYPD

1405
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:47,700
for every all-points juvenile
runaways in New York City.

1406
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:48,900
And don't forget the airports.

1407
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,900
He's been kiting checks
all over the country.

1408
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,300
But why New York?

1409
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:53,300
The Yankees!

1410
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:56,000
He said something
about the Yankees!

1411
01:07:57,300 --> 01:08:00,000
HANRATTY:
So where are we on the list?

1412
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:01,000
( rings doorbell )

1413
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,200
FOX:
Number 53, "Abagnahlee."

1414
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:06,700
HANRATTY:
Good morning, ma'am.

1415
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,000
We're the FBI agents
who called.

1416
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:09,600
Yes, I've been waiting.

1417
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,500
I hope you're all hungry.

1418
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,100
I put out the Sara Lee.

1419
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,400
My husband Jack is a lawyer.

1420
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:21,400
What about your first husband,
Mrs. "Abagnahlee"?

1421
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:25,200
Abagnale, but I prefer
to be called Barnes.

1422
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:28,600
"Frank William Abagnale."

1423
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,300
It says here
he was in the service.

1424
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,300
Did... Did you two meet
during the war?

1425
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,200
Yeah, I lived
in a very small village

1426
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:38,500
in France-- Montrichard--
the kind of place

1427
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:41,200
where they never heard
of Sara Lee.

1428
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,900
Help yourselves.

1429
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:44,900
"Nobody doesn't like Sara Lee."

1430
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,200
You filled out
a missing person's report

1431
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:50,400
for a runaway juvenile by
the name of Frank Abagnale Jr.

1432
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:52,000
Is Frankie okay?

1433
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:54,300
You're aware of the fact
that he wrote some checks

1434
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:56,200
on a closed account
at Chase Manhattan Bank?

1435
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,700
Oh, yes.

1436
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,300
The police think
he's some type of criminal.

1437
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:03,000
What he did was a felony,
Mrs. Barnes.

1438
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:04,800
It was $1 ,000.

1439
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:08,100
Half the kids his age are
on dope

1440
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:10,600
throwing rocks at police

1441
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:12,300
and they scared me to death

1442
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:14,500
because my son made
a little mistake.

1443
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:18,500
Huh. A 17-year-old...
boy has to eat

1444
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,700
has to have a place to sleep.

1445
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:23,400
We understand, ma'am.

1446
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:25,100
Would you happen to have
a picture of your son?

1447
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:27,100
Oh, yes.
I have his old yearbook.

1448
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:38,000
Okay.

1449
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:40,000
Okay, okay, we, uh...

1450
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
we need to send out
an all-office teletype.

1451
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,400
Our unsub's name is
Frank Abagnale Jr., age 17.

1452
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,700
Is Frankie okay?
Is he in trouble?

1453
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:50,300
Ma'am, I'm sorry
to have to tell you:

1454
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:51,500
Your son is forging checks.

1455
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:53,200
Forging checks? Wait!

1456
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:54,700
I'm sure we can take care
of that.

1457
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,700
I am working part-time
at the church now.

1458
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:59,200
Just tell me how much he owes
and I'll pay you back.

1459
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:02,100
So far, it's about $1 .3 million.

1460
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:08,900
( timer dings )

1461
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,200
( screaming and laughing )

1462
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,700
Hi, Melanie, how are you?

1463
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,100
When you're in the house,
please, just use an ashtray.

1464
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:25,100
Frank, this fondue is so good!

1465
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,900
Great. Here, take this for me.

1466
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:28,400
Ooh, good! I love Moet!

1467
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:31,400
Hey. How are you?

1468
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:37,100
( music slows and distorts )

1469
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,700
James, James, please!

1470
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,700
Just stay away from the
hi-fi system, all right?

1471
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:41,700
It's reel-to-reel.

1472
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,300
You can't wind it like that.

1473
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:46,600
( drink sloshes )

1474
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,800
Christ! Terry!

1475
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,100
This is Italian knit!

1476
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,100
Watch where you're going!

1477
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:52,600
It's just a shirt, man!

1478
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:55,200
Frank! Come quick!

1479
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:58,700
Lance just fell
into the conversation pit!

1480
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,500
Excuse me, you know
where Lance Applebaum is?

1481
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,300
Thank you.

1482
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:11,100
DOCTOR:
These bottles need to be labeled
when you pick them up.

1483
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,600
Do you understand
how dangerous this is?

1484
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:14,500
Do you?

1485
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:16,300
Don't stand there crying,
just nod your head

1486
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:17,700
and tell me
you won't do it again.

1487
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,600
Now dry up and get back to work.

1488
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:22,200
WOMAN ( over P.A. ):
Dr. Blair, Dr. Blair

1489
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,400
Dr. Sherwood Blair.

1490
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:27,200
( gently ):
Hey, hey... you okay?

1491
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:29,800
( sniffling ):
He told me to pick up the blood,

1492
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:32,300
so I did, but he never told me
to label it.

1493
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:34,300
Hey, it's okay.

1494
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:36,500
Stop crying.

1495
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,600
What's your name?

1496
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:41,400
-Brenda.
-Brenda.

1497
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,500
Brenda, I wouldn't worry
about it.

1498
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,000
You know, these doctors

1499
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:47,400
you know,
they don't know everything.

1500
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:49,000
It's my first week

1501
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,800
and I think they're
going to fire me.

1502
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:55,300
No, no, nobody's
going to fire you, Brenda.

1503
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:57,700
I bet you're good at your job.

1504
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:59,800
No, I'm not.

1505
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:03,200
Yeah, I bet if I asked you
to check on the status

1506
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:05,300
of my friend Lance Applebaum

1507
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:07,800
that you could do that for me
in a second.

1508
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:10,900
WOMAN ( over P.A. ):
Nurse Fitzsimmons to Recovery.

1509
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:12,500
Nurse Fitzsimmons to Recovery.

1510
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:16,000
Um...

1511
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Mr. Applebaum fractured
his ankle.

1512
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,400
Dr. Ashland is treating him
in exam room seven.

1513
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:26,100
You see that? No problem.

1514
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:30,300
This is the emergency chart.

1515
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:31,800
See that blue star there?

1516
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:34,700
That means that the patient
has been diagnosed.

1517
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:36,500
And then,
after he's been treated

1518
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:40,100
we put a red circle here, see?

1519
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,800
How do you like those braces?

1520
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,900
I guess they're all right.

1521
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,100
I got mine off last year.

1522
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:51,800
Boy, I hated them.
They were bottoms.

1523
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:55,200
You know, I still got to wear
my mouth guard.

1524
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,400
You have really nice teeth.

1525
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,600
Well, thank you.

1526
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:03,900
And you have a pretty smile.

1527
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,800
WOMAN ( over P.A. ):
Custodial to cafeteria.

1528
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:07,100
( giggles )

1529
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:08,300
No, I mean it.

1530
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,300
I really think
those braces look good on you.

1531
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,300
Thank you.

1532
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,700
You're welcome.

1533
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:18,700
Brenda.

1534
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,000
Yeah.

1535
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:23,000
Do you know if they're hiring
here at the hospital?

1536
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,100
I'm not sure.

1537
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:27,700
What do you want to do?

1538
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:31,600
I'm a doctor.

1539
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:35,800
FRANK:
DearDad:

1540
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:38,200
l've decided to get
off the road forawhile.

1541
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:40,600
l've taken a nightjob
at a hospital

1542
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:42,300
and met
some really nice people.

1543
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,500
Feels good to have my feet
on the ground

1544
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:48,200
to wake up in the same bed
every night.

1545
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:52,300
Who knows, maybe l'll even find
someone to settle down with.

1546
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,100
Harvard Medical School...

1547
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:59,400
top of your class.

1548
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:02,600
Southern California
Children's Hospital.

1549
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:06,300
Well, that's a pretty impressive
resume, Dr. Conners

1550
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:09,500
but unfortunately, uh...
the only thing I need

1551
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:13,000
is a...
an emergency room supervisor

1552
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,000
for my midnight to 8:00am shift

1553
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:20,400
someone to baby-sit
six interns and 20 nurses

1554
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:23,300
but, uh...

1555
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:27,300
Hell, I doubt that, uh,
you would be interested in that.

1556
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:29,900
Well, in the past

1557
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,000
they've always let me choose
my own nurses.

1558
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,700
Dr. Connelly?

1559
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,000
Dr. Harris?

1560
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,200
Present.

1561
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:40,900
Dr. Ashland?

1562
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:42,600
Dr. Conners...

1563
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,900
You gonna take roll every night?

1564
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:46,800
Uh, yes, I will, Dr. Ashland

1565
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:50,800
and if you're going to be late,
I suggest you bring a note.

1566
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:54,000
( snickering )

1567
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:56,200
Miss Basmann.

1568
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:58,000
Miss Mace.

1569
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,600
Miss Strong.

1570
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:01,100
Here.

1571
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:03,300
Nurse Brown.

1572
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:05,400
-Nurse Sanford?
-Here.

1573
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,400
SURGEON ( on TV ):
30 milligrams of codeine

1574
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:08,400
every four hours.

1575
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,000
Run the plasma
at 60 drops a minute

1576
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:12,000
until we calculate
the fluid requirements.

1577
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:14,000
What do you estimate
the degree and extent

1578
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:15,200
of the burns, Kildare?

1579
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:16,900
DR. KILDARE:
Second and third-degree burns

1580
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:18,600
over about 20 percent
of the body surface.

1581
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:19,600
Do you concur?

1582
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,600
I concur.

1583
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:22,600
Let's get him up to Pediatrics.

1584
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:26,100
WOMAN ( over P.A. ):
Nurse Hopp
to the Nurses' Station South.

1585
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:28,900
Nurse Hopp
to the Nurses' Station South.

1586
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,400
Hello, Brenda.

1587
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:31,800
Hi, Dr. Conners.

1588
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,800
You need to sign these.

1589
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,800
Thank you.

1590
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,900
Do you notice anything
different about me, Doctor?

1591
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:45,800
-You got your braces off!
-Yeah!

1592
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:47,000
Come here. Let me see.

1593
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,800
I've been trying
to show you all night!

1594
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,000
( thunder rumbling )

1595
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:52,500
Wow. Good job.

1596
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:53,600
Yeah?

1597
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:54,700
So, did it hurt
when they took them off?

1598
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:56,200
Mine felt so weird after.

1599
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,700
Mm, I keep rubbing my tongue
over them.

1600
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:00,500
I can't stop.
They're so slippery.

1601
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,100
It feels good, though,
doesn't it?

1602
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:04,100
Yeah, it feels incredible.

1603
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:08,000
( thunder rumbles )

1604
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,300
Oh, my.

1605
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:17,800
I'm... I'm sorry.

1606
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,800
( thunder crashes )

1607
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,800
( passionate moaning )

1608
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,400
WOMAN ( over P.A. ):
Dr. Conners to the ER.

1609
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:33,100
Dr. Conners to the ER.

1610
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,300
Shouldn't you go?

1611
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,200
No. No, no.

1612
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,200
They have a staff doctor
in the emergency ward.

1613
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,200
We'll be fine.

1614
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:47,900
( panting ):
What if he's in surgery?

1615
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,100
Do you really think
I have to go?

1616
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:53,800
Oh. In here, Dr. Conners.

1617
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,800
( child sobbing )

1618
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:07,800
( sobbing )

1619
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:14,100
Gentlemen, what, uh...
what seems to be the problem?

1620
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,500
Bicycle accident.

1621
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:19,600
Fractured tibia about
five inches below the patella.

1622
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,600
Hmm.

1623
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:26,200
-Dr. Harris.
-Yes?

1624
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:27,300
Do you concur?

1625
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:30,800
C... Concur with what, sir?

1626
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,800
With what Dr. Ashland just said.

1627
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,400
Do you... Do you concur?

1628
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,800
Uh... well, it was
a bicycle accident.

1629
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,700
Um, the boy told us.

1630
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:41,300
So you concur?

1631
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:43,400
Concur? Uh...

1632
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:44,700
I think we should take an X ray

1633
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:47,500
then stitch him up
and put him in a walking cast.

1634
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:48,700
( moans )

1635
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,000
That's very good, Dr. Ashland.
Very good.

1636
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:55,800
Well, you don't seem
to have much need for me.

1637
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:57,500
Carry on.

1638
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:02,100
I blew it, didn't I?

1639
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,300
Why didn't I concur?

1640
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:07,400
WOMAN ( over P.A. ):
Dr. Henning, call extension 219.

1641
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,000
Dr. Henning, extension 219.

1642
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
( vomiting )

1643
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:22,900
( distant jackhammer drilling )

1644
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:27,400
FRANK SR.:
Make yourself at home!

1645
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:30,400
Frank Abagnale Sr.

1646
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,900
You're not a cop.

1647
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:36,700
Special Agent Hanratty, FBI.

1648
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:37,700
You're not a cop.

1649
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:40,200
My landlord said
you were not a cop.

1650
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:41,900
Well, if you're going
to arrest me

1651
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:43,500
I'd like
to put on a different suit

1652
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:44,700
if that's okay with you.

1653
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,400
No, no, I'm not here
to arrest you.

1654
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,500
I'm looking for your son.
He's in trouble.

1655
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:50,000
Do you know where he is?

1656
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,000
If I tell you where he is

1657
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
will you promise
not to tell his mother?

1658
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,700
Sure.

1659
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:01,200
Frank made up a fake I.D.

1660
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:02,700
and enlisted
in the Marine Corps.

1661
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:04,200
He's over in Vietnam right now.

1662
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:06,500
That kid is halfway
around the world

1663
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:08,600
crawling through the damn jungle

1664
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:11,000
fighting the Communists, so...

1665
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,300
( shuts refrigerator door )

1666
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:16,900
please, don't come to my home
and call my boy a criminal

1667
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,300
because that kid has
more guts...

1668
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,300
I never said he was a criminal,
Mr. Abagnale.

1669
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:22,000
I said he was in trouble.

1670
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:25,500
If you'd like to give me a call
and talk, here's my number.

1671
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:37,800
( pen scribbling )

1672
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:39,700
You're not a father, are you?

1673
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:44,200
Pardon me?

1674
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,700
If you were a father,
you'd know.

1675
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:49,100
I would never give up my son.

1676
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:52,800
I would never give up my son.

1677
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:56,300
Yes, sir. I understand.

1678
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:58,500
Sean, Sean, now get this:

1679
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,000
"Riverbend Apartments

1680
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,500
415 Landover, Atlanta, Georgia."

1681
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:04,900
Atlanta, Georgia.

1682
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,600
Yeah, I'm on my way
to the airport.

1683
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:09,200
I'll meet the team in, uh,
in four hours.

1684
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,300
Bye-bye.

1685
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:14,000
Come on, it's okay.

1686
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,600
( Brenda sobs )

1687
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,500
You don't have to cry.

1688
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:18,800
I'm sorry.

1689
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,600
I'm so sorry, Frank.

1690
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:22,100
I can't do this.

1691
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,700
Brenda, listen to me.

1692
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:27,000
I don't care if you're
a virgin, all right?

1693
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:28,200
Really, I can wait.

1694
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:31,400
I'm not a virgin.

1695
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:38,000
I had an abortion two years ago.

1696
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:44,800
My parents had a friend do it

1697
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,100
a man that my father
plays golf with.

1698
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:53,400
And then, when I got better,
they kicked me out of the house.

1699
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:56,300
I had an abortion and I wasn't
their daughter anymore.

1700
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:57,800
( gently ):
Hey...

1701
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:58,800
I'm so sorry.

1702
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,400
please don't be mad at me.

1703
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,500
please, please,
don't be mad at me.

1704
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:03,700
No, no.

1705
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:05,500
please don't be mad at me.

1706
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,400
Shh. Now... what if...

1707
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:10,700
what if I spoke
to your parents, right?

1708
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:12,700
May-Maybe I can
straighten things out, huh?

1709
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:14,700
Well, I ask them all the time

1710
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:17,400
but they said I still
can't come home.

1711
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:21,600
And my daddy's... a lawyer.

1712
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,600
Aw...

1713
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:32,300
Brenda...

1714
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:35,800
what if you were engaged
to a doctor?

1715
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:37,800
Will that change anything?

1716
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:39,500
What?

1717
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:46,800
What if I went
to your parents...

1718
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,900
and I spoke to your father...

1719
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,600
and I asked permission
to marry you?

1720
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
It's empty.

1721
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,500
Nobody here.

1722
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:31,400
( classical music playing )

1723
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:35,800
( woman laughs )

1724
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:38,900
Dr. Conners, are you Lutheran?

1725
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:44,300
Yes, I-I am a Lutheran,
but, please, call me Frank.

1726
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:46,900
Frank, would you like
to say grace?

1727
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:55,500
Unless you're not comfortable.

1728
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,600
Absolutely.

1729
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:01,300
( clears throat )

1730
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:10,700
Two little mice fell
into a bucket of cream.

1731
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,600
The first mouse quickly
gave up and drowned

1732
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:16,900
but the second mouse,
he struggled so hard

1733
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:19,500
that he eventually churned
that cream into butter

1734
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,500
and he walked out.

1735
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:25,700
-Amen.
-Amen.

1736
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,700
Amen. Oh, that was beautiful.

1737
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,400
The mouse, he churned
that cream into butter.

1738
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:34,000
( sighing happily )

1739
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:35,000
That's right.

1740
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:36,400
That's pretty good.

1741
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,100
Thank you.

1742
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:39,900
Frank, have you decided
which hospital

1743
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:41,800
you want to work at
here in New Orleans?

1744
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:44,000
Well, um, to be quite honest

1745
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,200
I'm thinking
about getting back into law.

1746
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:49,000
Oh, my!

1747
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:51,300
Are you a doctor or a lawyer?

1748
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:55,200
Before I went to medical school,
I passed the bar in California.

1749
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,700
I practiced law for one year

1750
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:01,000
then I decided why not
try my hand at pediatrics?

1751
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,800
You're just full of surprises.

1752
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:05,600
Yeah.

1753
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:07,200
MOTHER ( laughing ):
Oh, my.

1754
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:08,800
A doctor and a lawyer.

1755
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,300
Well, I'd say that Brenda
hit the jackpot.

1756
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:13,300
Where did you go to law school?

1757
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:15,000
Uh, Berkeley.

1758
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,000
( gasping )

1759
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,400
Berkley, Berkley. Oh, my gosh.

1760
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:19,000
Isn't that where you went,
Daddy?

1761
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,900
Maybe Frank could come work
for you, Roger.

1762
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,700
You're always saying
how hard it is

1763
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,300
to find
Assistant Prosecutors.

1764
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:26,500
Could he, Daddy?
Could he, please?

1765
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:28,000
Could he come work with you,
please?

1766
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:30,100
Was that snake Hollingsworth
still teaching there

1767
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:31,500
when you went through Berkley?

1768
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,200
( laughs quietly )

1769
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:34,700
Hollingsworth.

1770
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,900
Yes. Grumpy old Hollingsworth,
right?

1771
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:39,500
I tell you. Meaner than ever.

1772
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:41,500
And that dog of his?

1773
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:48,300
Tell me, Frank, what was
the name of his little dog?

1774
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:00,300
I'm sorry. Uh...

1775
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:02,300
The dog was dead.

1776
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:03,800
( women cooing )

1777
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:07,400
How unfortunate.

1778
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:09,400
Yeah.

1779
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:42,500
A doctor, a lawyer,
a Lutheran...

1780
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:48,200
So what are you, Frank?

1781
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:50,000
'Cause I think you're
about to ask

1782
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:51,900
for my daughter's hand
in marriage

1783
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:53,400
and I have a right to know.

1784
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:55,700
Know what, sir?

1785
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:58,500
The truth.

1786
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:03,000
Tell me the truth, Frank.

1787
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,800
What are you doing here?

1788
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:10,000
What is a man like you doing
with Brenda?

1789
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,100
If you want my blessing

1790
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:14,300
if you want my daughter

1791
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:17,300
I'd like to hear it
from you now.

1792
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:22,100
The truth is, sir, that...

1793
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,300
The truth is that...

1794
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:33,000
I'm not a doctor,
I'm not a lawyer...

1795
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:38,100
I'm not an airline pilot.

1796
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:41,100
I'm... I'm nothing, really.

1797
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:50,800
I'm-I'm-I'm just a kid who's
in love with your daughter.

1798
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:56,400
No.

1799
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:06,600
You know what you are?

1800
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:08,700
You're a romantic.

1801
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:11,700
Men like us are nothing
without the women we love.

1802
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:15,400
I must confess, I'm guilty
of the same foolish whimsy.

1803
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:17,600
I proposed to Carol
after five dates

1804
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:20,600
with two nickels in my pockets
and holes in my shoes

1805
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:22,700
because I knew she was the one.

1806
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,600
So go ahead, Frank.

1807
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,700
Don't be afraid.

1808
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:34,400
Ask the question you came here
to ask me.

1809
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,900
Sir, uh, uh...

1810
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:40,400
w-what would I have to do

1811
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:43,100
to take the bar
here in New Orleans?

1812
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:45,100
( laughing )

1813
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:51,200
No, the... the other question.

1814
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:54,700
( ticking )

1815
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:58,700
WOMAN:
Right through that door.

1816
01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:01,600
Good luck, Mr. Conners.

1817
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:03,400
Thank you.

1818
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:12,400
Hey, Frank...

1819
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,600
you know what I could
never figure out?

1820
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:17,400
How did you cheat on the
bar exam in Louisiana?

1821
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:19,200
Why? What's the difference?

1822
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:21,600
Someone else took the test
for you, didn't they?

1823
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:24,400
Carl, I'm going to prison
for a long time.

1824
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:27,200
Seriously,
what's the difference?

1825
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,500
It's a simple question.

1826
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:31,900
Are you going to eat
that eclair?

1827
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:38,100
Yeah. I'm saving it for later.

1828
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:40,000
Well, you want
to split it with me?

1829
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,500
No.

1830
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:47,000
Give me half that eclair
and I'll tell you.

1831
01:28:56,600 --> 01:29:01,000
I'm going to figure it out
sooner or later.

1832
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:11,000
You'll be working under
Phillip Rigby in corporate law.

1833
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:14,100
Why don't you settle in,
organize your desk?

1834
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:17,800
Thank you.

1835
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:20,700
We're having lunch at 12:30
with the Attorney General

1836
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:22,700
and Governor McKeithen.

1837
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:24,000
Himself.

1838
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:25,400
The Governor.

1839
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:26,600
Did we spell it right?

1840
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:28,200
You sure did.

1841
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:30,100
Congratulations.

1842
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:31,300
Thank you, sir.

1843
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:32,600
Welcome aboard.

1844
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:34,600
Now...

1845
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,700
Look at this photograph,
Mr. Stewart.

1846
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:44,900
It's a photograph
of Prentice York

1847
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:47,000
where they found him, dead.

1848
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:50,300
Now, here is an enlargement
of part of that photograph.

1849
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:52,900
This is a photograph
of the defendant's signature

1850
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,400
on a canceled check.

1851
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:57,000
Now, here is an enlargement
of that same signature

1852
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:58,200
which matches

1853
01:29:58,300 --> 01:30:01,200
the signature on the letters
that he wrote to Mrs. Simon

1854
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:03,100
which discuss the possibility

1855
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:05,400
of defrauding
the great State of Louisiana.

1856
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:08,700
Your Honor,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury

1857
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:10,400
this is irrefutable evidence

1858
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:13,700
that the defendant is,
in fact, lying.

1859
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:15,500
( echoing thud )

1860
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:17,400
( chair slams against floor )

1861
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:24,200
Mr. Conners, this is
a preliminary hearing.

1862
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:27,800
There is no... defendant.

1863
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:32,400
There is no... jury.

1864
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:35,500
It's just me.

1865
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:37,100
Son...

1866
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:41,500
what in the hell is wrong
with you?!

1867
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:43,400
-( applause over TV )
-Is that Mitch?

1868
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:45,200
Roger! It's Mitch!

1869
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:47,400
Oh, my,
I lost all track of time.

1870
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:49,800
MITCH MILLER ( on TV ):
As studio guests
for the sing-along tonight

1871
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:52,100
we have the children's choir
of St. Monica's Church

1872
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:53,900
in New York City.

1873
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,700
Won't you join them and the gang

1874
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:58,000
in a few songs for the Irish?
Everybody!

1875
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:03,600
( all but Frank joining in ):

1876
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:26,200
( joining in ):

1877
01:31:36,100 --> 01:31:38,400
JUDY GARLAND ( on record ):

1878
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:29,500
( whispers ):
Dad.

1879
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:36,300
What are you doing here?

1880
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:40,700
I... I-I came to see you.

1881
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:46,000
What are you doing
dressed like this?

1882
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,900
I took a job. A government job.

1883
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,400
You see what I'm doing?

1884
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:51,200
Do you have a good lawyer?

1885
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:53,700
Well... I sort of
am a lawyer now.

1886
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:57,500
Look at this letter.
The IRS wants more.

1887
01:32:57,500 --> 01:33:00,000
I had a deal with them:
two penalties.

1888
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,400
They ate the cake,
now they want the crumbs.

1889
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:06,300
I want to sue them.

1890
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:09,300
Now they want the crumbs.

1891
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:11,400
They... Here, sit down.

1892
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:14,000
They're trying to scare me,
intimidate me.

1893
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:16,600
You know what?

1894
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:20,100
You know what?
I'll make them chase me...

1895
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:22,600
for the rest of their lives.

1896
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:32,300
Hey, it's great
to see you, Daddy.

1897
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:36,700
Listen, sit down, I...
I want to show you something.

1898
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:40,800
I came here to give you this.

1899
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:45,100
It's an invitation
to an engagement party.

1900
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:49,000
Daddy, I'm getting married.

1901
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:52,000
Can you believe that?
I'm getting married.

1902
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:54,600
You don't need to worry
about anything now, Dad.

1903
01:33:54,700 --> 01:33:56,900
Listen, I'm getting
a brand-new Cadillac.

1904
01:33:56,900 --> 01:33:58,700
I'm getting a $60,000 house.

1905
01:33:58,700 --> 01:34:00,700
I'm-I'm getting it all back.

1906
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:03,200
All-All the jewelry,
all the furs, everything, Dad.

1907
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:06,000
Everything they took from us,
I'm going to get it back.

1908
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,900
Now...

1909
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:11,600
has Ma seen you
dressed like this?

1910
01:34:11,700 --> 01:34:15,100
Yeah, she came
to pick up some boxes.

1911
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:16,800
That's okay, that's okay,
you know why?

1912
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:18,900
'Cause she... she's going
to the wedding with us.

1913
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:20,800
I'm going to get you
a brand-new suit, Dad.

1914
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,700
I'm getting you
a brand-new suit.

1915
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:24,900
One of those Manhattan Eagle,
three-button, black pearl suits.

1916
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:25,900
You'll look great.

1917
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,400
Those are nice. Yeah.

1918
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:30,100
She won't see me.

1919
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:33,000
Well, have you tried
to call her?

1920
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,100
Uh-uh.

1921
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:37,700
Why don't... why don't you
call her right now?

1922
01:34:37,700 --> 01:34:40,200
Dad, why don't you
call her right now? Here.

1923
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:42,800
Dad, just call her.
Call her for me.

1924
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:44,500
You call her, and you tell her

1925
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:47,300
I have two first-class tickets
to go see her son's wedding...

1926
01:34:47,300 --> 01:34:49,900
Your mother's married now,
to my friend Jack Barnes.

1927
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:53,000
They have a house
in Long Island.

1928
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:56,700
( whispering ):
I had an FBI agent come see me.

1929
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:58,600
You got their number, son.

1930
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:00,700
The guy looked scared.

1931
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:05,200
The United States government,
champ, running for the hills.

1932
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:07,600
Pow! To the moon!

1933
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:21,800
Dad... it's over.

1934
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:25,200
I'm going to stop now.

1935
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:27,300
But y-you've...

1936
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:29,500
They're never going
to catch you, Frank.

1937
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:31,700
-Dad, she wouldn't do that.
-Why won't you sit down?

1938
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:33,700
-Why would she do that to you?
-Come on, sit.

1939
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:35,400
Come on, sit with me.
Have a drink.

1940
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:36,800
I'm your father.

1941
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:40,200
Then ask me to stop.

1942
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:42,500
( quietly ):
Then ask me to stop.

1943
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:47,400
You can't stop.

1944
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:51,300
Where are you going?

1945
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:53,700
Come on, Frank,
where are you going?

1946
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,200
Where are you going?

1947
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:57,200
Where are you going tonight?

1948
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:58,400
Someplace exotic?

1949
01:35:58,400 --> 01:35:59,700
Where are you going tonight?

1950
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:00,900
Tahiti, Hawaii?

1951
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:15,000
( phone ringing )

1952
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:21,700
This is Hanratty.

1953
01:36:21,700 --> 01:36:23,700
FRANK:
Hello, Carl.

1954
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:25,700
Merry Christmas.

1955
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:28,100
How are you, Dr. Conners?

1956
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:32,600
Carl, I haven't been Dr. Conners
for months now.

1957
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:34,500
( Hanratty sniffles,
clears throat )

1958
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:39,400
Well... I'm sitting here
in my office on Christmas Eve.

1959
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:41,000
What do you want?

1960
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:45,300
( instrumental version "l'll Be
Home for Christmas" playing )

1961
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:48,100
( sighs ):
Okay.

1962
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,700
I want it to be over.

1963
01:36:57,900 --> 01:37:00,200
Uh... I want it to be over.

1964
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:02,100
I'm getting married.

1965
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:04,200
You know, I'm settling down.

1966
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:06,200
You've stolen almost $4 million.

1967
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:08,500
You think we can just
call that a wedding present?

1968
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:11,600
Nah, this isn't something you
get to walk away from, Frank.

1969
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:13,100
I want to call a truce.

1970
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:14,200
No truce.

1971
01:37:14,300 --> 01:37:16,200
You will be caught,
you will go to prison.

1972
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:17,900
Where did you think
this was going?

1973
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:21,300
please leave me alone, Carl.

1974
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:22,700
please?

1975
01:37:22,700 --> 01:37:24,500
I'm getting close, aren't I?

1976
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:26,700
You're scared because
I'm getting close.

1977
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:29,900
I know you... you rented
that car in Shreveport

1978
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,900
and you stayed in that hotel
on Lake Charles.

1979
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
You want to run, be my guest.

1980
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,300
Your checks don't lie
as well as you do.

1981
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:40,400
Stop chasing me.

1982
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:45,200
I can't stop.

1983
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:47,800
It's my job.

1984
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:50,300
It's okay, Carl.

1985
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:53,800
I just thought I'd ask,
you know?

1986
01:37:56,200 --> 01:38:00,300
Hey. Merry Christmas, huh?

1987
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:03,500
( click and dial tone )

1988
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:06,000
I love my job.

1989
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:07,700
All right... ( clears throat )

1990
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:09,200
let's get every newspaper
we can

1991
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:11,800
every newspaper in Louisiana
for the last two months.

1992
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:13,100
What are we looking for?

1993
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:15,400
Engagement announcements,
name of Conners.

1994
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:17,800
Conners?! Come on, Carl,
the kid would've

1995
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:19,400
changed his name by now.

1996
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:22,200
Mm-mm. He can't change it.

1997
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:24,100
She thinks he's Conners.

1998
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:26,300
If he loses the name,
he loses the girl.

1999
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:40,200
-Congratulations.
-You having a good time?

2000
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:50,300
-Oh.
-Hi.

2001
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:51,300
Oh, me too. Thank you.

2002
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:53,200
I'm going to, uh,
the little boys' room.

2003
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:54,300
-Okay.
-Okay.

2004
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:55,900
Hurry back.

2005
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:04,900
( car approaching )

2006
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:08,000
( brakes squeaking )

2007
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:11,600
Good evening.

2008
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:13,600
I'm Agent Hanratty
with the FBI.

2009
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:15,600
We'd like to have
a few quiet words

2010
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:17,000
with your host, if possible.

2011
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
MAN:
I'll get him.

2012
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:21,600
Right over there, sir.

2013
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:24,200
-Hi, Roger. How are you?
-Hi, Vin.

2014
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:26,600
Good evening, gentlemen.
I'm Roger Strong.

2015
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:28,100
Carl Hanratty, FBI.

2016
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:30,300
This is Agents Amdursky and Fox.

2017
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:32,500
Sorry to crash your party, sir.

2018
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:34,500
Not at all.
What can I do for you?

2019
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:37,900
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to meet the groom.

2020
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:40,900
Is there a problem?

2021
01:39:40,900 --> 01:39:42,700
-( laughter )
-Frank! Frank!

2022
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:44,300
Can you hold all these?

2023
01:39:44,300 --> 01:39:45,400
( whispering ):
Yeah. Come here.

2024
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:47,800
They're checks.
They're from my dad's friends.

2025
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:50,000
They're for us, so we can
start a new life... Hey!

2026
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:51,700
What are you doing?
What's wrong?

2027
01:39:51,700 --> 01:39:53,400
We have to leave.

2028
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:55,300
What?!

2029
01:39:55,300 --> 01:39:58,300
Brenda, you love me, right?

2030
01:39:58,300 --> 01:39:59,300
Yes.

2031
01:39:59,300 --> 01:40:00,400
I mean, you'd love me
no matter what.

2032
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:01,400
Yes.

2033
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:02,400
I mean, you'd love me

2034
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:04,000
whether I was sick
or whether I was poor

2035
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:05,400
or even if I had
a different name.

2036
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:06,900
Frank, where'd you get
all that money?

2037
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,700
Brenda, listen. A name, right?

2038
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:09,800
A name, it doesn't matter.

2039
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:11,100
My name is Frank Conners, right?

2040
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:12,400
-That's who I am with you.
-Yes.

2041
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:13,700
But-but we all have secrets.

2042
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:15,200
You know,
sometimes when I travel

2043
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:17,500
I use the name Frank Taylor.
That-That's my secret.

2044
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:19,500
-Frank Taylor?!
-Yeah, Frank Taylor, you know?

2045
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:20,700
-Frank Black.
-Frank Black?!

2046
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:21,900
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

2047
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,600
Why are you saying all this?

2048
01:40:24,700 --> 01:40:27,400
Brenda... Brenda, I don't want
to lie to you anymore.

2049
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:29,000
All right? I'm not a doctor.

2050
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:30,800
I never went to medical school.

2051
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:33,500
I'm not a lawyer or a Harvard
graduate or a Lutheran.

2052
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:36,100
Brenda, I ran away from home
a year and a half ago

2053
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:38,000
when I was 16.

2054
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:40,800
Frank...

2055
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:43,100
Frank?

2056
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:45,100
You're not a Lutheran?

2057
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:47,600
Brenda... you see
all this money?

2058
01:40:47,700 --> 01:40:49,700
You see all this money?
I have more.

2059
01:40:49,700 --> 01:40:52,300
I have plenty more.

2060
01:40:52,300 --> 01:40:53,300
I have enough money

2061
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:55,300
to last us
for the rest of our lives

2062
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:56,700
-( gasps )
-Look.

2063
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:59,400
Frank, stop teasing me.

2064
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:00,700
You're Frank Conners.

2065
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:03,800
You're Frank Conners,
and you're 28 years old and...

2066
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:05,200
( whispering ):
Brenda...

2067
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:07,200
Why would you lie to me?

2068
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:09,500
-Brenda, Brenda...
-I want to know your name.

2069
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:11,600
-Listen to me, Brenda.
-Tell me your name.

2070
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:13,000
We can live anywhere we want

2071
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,600
but you have to trust me,
Brenda.

2072
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:16,000
-Do you trust me?
-Yes.

2073
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
-Do you love me, Brenda?
-Yes.

2074
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:19,500
-You love me?
-I love you.

2075
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:22,000
Excuse me, Mother.

2076
01:41:22,100 --> 01:41:24,400
Honey, this is Mr. Hanratty.
My wife Carol.

2077
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:26,500
-Oh, Mister...?
-Hanratty, ma'am.

2078
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:27,600
-Ratty.
-Yes.

2079
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:29,000
Have you seen Frank or Brenda?

2080
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:31,200
I-I think they went upstairs.

2081
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:38,300
Frank...

2082
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:42,000
( whispers ):
Brenda, come here.

2083
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Okay, in two days,
you're going to meet me

2084
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:46,200
at Miami International
Airport, all right?

2085
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:48,800
You're going to leave the house
after your parents go to sleep.

2086
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:50,000
You're going to take a taxicab.

2087
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:51,800
You give the taxi driver
this money right here

2088
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:53,700
and you tell him to drive
all through the night.

2089
01:41:53,700 --> 01:41:55,600
Brenda, you're going
to leave at 10:00am.

2090
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:57,400
-10:00am, all right?
-But...

2091
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:59,700
( scatting )

2092
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:08,400
( jazz continues in distance )

2093
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:18,000
Which room, sir?

2094
01:42:18,100 --> 01:42:19,400
In the corner.

2095
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:20,700
You have to listen to me,
all right?

2096
01:42:20,700 --> 01:42:22,800
The International Terminal
in Miami, all right? Say it.

2097
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,300
Okay, the International
Terminal in Miami.

2098
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:25,700
-No matter what...
-No matter what...

2099
01:42:25,700 --> 01:42:27,700
-You're going to take a taxicab.
-I will take a taxi.

2100
01:42:27,700 --> 01:42:29,300
You're going to be there
at 10:00am.

2101
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:30,600
I will be there at 10:00am,
no matter what.

2102
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:31,600
-In two days.
-Two days.

2103
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:32,600
Two days, Brenda. Two days.

2104
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:34,100
In two days, I'll be there

2105
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:35,800
no matter what, at 10:00am.

2106
01:42:42,700 --> 01:42:44,200
You're not going
to tell anyone, Brenda.

2107
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:45,300
You have to promise me, now.

2108
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:46,700
( crying ):
Frank, please!

2109
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:49,100
Before you go,
please tell me your name.

2110
01:42:49,100 --> 01:42:51,500
please, tell me.

2111
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:56,100
Frank William Abagnale Jr.

2112
01:42:58,100 --> 01:43:00,500
( ominous music playing )

2113
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:06,500
( light, child like theme plays )

2114
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:11,100
( wind blowing )

2115
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:18,200
( ominous theme building )

2116
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:20,800
( child like theme returns )

2117
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:26,100
( shuddering )

2118
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:45,200
WOMAN ( over P.A. ):
National Airlines

2119
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:48,000
flight number 27, serving
Fort Myers, Sarasota, Tampa

2120
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:51,700
and New York Kennedy,
is now available at gate n...

2121
01:43:53,700 --> 01:43:58,000
Skycap, Gate 14.
Skycap, Gate 14.

2122
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,500
Taxi!

2123
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:02,500
( announcements continue
indistinctly over P.A. )

2124
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:12,100
MAN ( over P.A. ):
Your attention...

2125
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:07,500
( sighing )

2126
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:10,400
Brenda.

2127
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:23,900
AMDURSKY:
This guy's a no-show.

2128
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,000
He must've got wise to us.

2129
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,000
HANRATTY:
Maybe he was tipped.

2130
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:27,100
If he's not here today,
he'll be tomorrow.

2131
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:28,600
We'll get him before
he leaves the country.

2132
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:30,000
He doesn't have a passport.

2133
01:45:30,100 --> 01:45:32,600
For the last six months, he's
gone to Harvard and Berkeley.

2134
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:34,000
I'm betting he can get
a passport.

2135
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,800
So we have all our men
waiting for him here

2136
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:36,800
in Miami International.

2137
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:38,600
He's used it before.
He knows the layout.

2138
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:40,500
I talked to Miami police;
they've offered us

2139
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:42,200
50 uniformed cops
in two shifts of 25.

2140
01:45:42,300 --> 01:45:44,400
With our guys, that's almost
100 men in one airport.

2141
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:46,200
Don't you think
we should spread it around?

2142
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:48,000
No, no, this is the exit point.

2143
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,200
Well, how do you know
he hasn't rented a car

2144
01:45:50,300 --> 01:45:52,500
and driven to airports
in New York, Atlanta?

2145
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:54,000
Because I'm not in New York.

2146
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,300
I'm not in Atlanta.

2147
01:45:55,300 --> 01:45:57,200
Yes, this is, uh, Frank Roberts

2148
01:45:57,200 --> 01:45:59,300
and I'm letting
all the universities

2149
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:02,200
in the area know
that Pan Am will be initiating

2150
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:04,300
a new recruiting program
this year.

2151
01:46:04,300 --> 01:46:07,500
I'll, uh, be stopping
by your campus tomorrow morning.

2152
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:10,700
Thank you all very much
for coming.

2153
01:46:10,700 --> 01:46:11,900
At the end of the day

2154
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:15,000
I'll be choosing eight
young ladies to be a part of...

2155
01:46:15,100 --> 01:46:16,700
( cheering and laughter )

2156
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:19,500
...Pan Am's future stewardess
flight crew program.

2157
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:22,100
Now, these eight young ladies
will accompany me

2158
01:46:22,200 --> 01:46:25,200
on a two-month public relations
tour through Europe.

2159
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:26,500
( women squealing )

2160
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:29,200
They will discover firsthand
what it takes

2161
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:31,400
to be a Pan American stewardess.

2162
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:33,200
( cheering )

2163
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:35,900
HANRATTY:
Give me at least two men...

2164
01:46:35,900 --> 01:46:38,400
Nah, one man
per every two counters.

2165
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:39,900
-Mm-hmm.
-All right?

2166
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:41,400
Amdursky?

2167
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:43,400
Yeah?

2168
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:45,600
Make sure your uniforms
are covering

2169
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,600
the sidewalk entrances
and exits.

2170
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:51,700
Hey... let's have, uh, periodic
sweeps of the men's lav.

2171
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:53,500
You, here.

2172
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:57,400
What qualifies me
to be a future stewardess?

2173
01:46:57,400 --> 01:47:00,500
Well, I think
that I'm really friendly

2174
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:02,200
and I can really help out

2175
01:47:02,300 --> 01:47:05,400
and, um, make people
feel welcome on the plane and...

2176
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:08,000
We'll be traveling
at 6,000 miles per hour

2177
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,700
at an altitude of 300 feet.

2178
01:47:14,900 --> 01:47:17,200
( playing dramatic piano intro )

2179
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:18,600
llene Anderson.

2180
01:47:18,700 --> 01:47:20,900
( squealing and applause )

2181
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:26,100
( pianist playing
"Come Fly With Me" )

2182
01:47:26,100 --> 01:47:28,400
Miggy Acker.

2183
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:30,900
( excited squealing )

2184
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:35,200
Debra Jo McMillan.

2185
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,200
Candy Heston.

2186
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:20,200
( appreciative whistle )

2187
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:22,500
Hi.

2188
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,300
( wolf whistle )

2189
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:43,900
You see that blonde out front?

2190
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,100
I should have been a pilot.

2191
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:46,900
Exactly.

2192
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,400
WOMAN ( over P.A. ):
Mr. Carl Hanratty

2193
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:49,900
please pick up
the courtesy telephone.

2194
01:48:49,900 --> 01:48:51,100
Hanratty.

2195
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:53,300
AMDURSKY:
Carl, your walkie-talkie
wasn't working.

2196
01:48:53,300 --> 01:48:54,800
There's a guy
in a Pan Am uniform

2197
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:57,500
sitting in a white Coupe DeVille
out in front of Terminal J.

2198
01:48:57,500 --> 01:48:58,600
That's the charter terminal.

2199
01:48:58,700 --> 01:48:59,900
Can you get a look at his face?

2200
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,100
He's got his pilot's cap on.

2201
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:02,400
Carl, I think it's him!

2202
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:07,600
( siren blaring )

2203
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:09,100
Watch out, watch out,
watch out!

2204
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,900
( agents shouting )

2205
01:49:14,900 --> 01:49:16,400
Out of the car, Frank.

2206
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:18,000
( patrol cars' tires squealing )

2207
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Frank?!

2208
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,100
Step out of the car!

2209
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:23,500
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

2210
01:49:23,500 --> 01:49:25,200
Don't shoot me!
I'm just a driver.

2211
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:27,300
A man paid me $100
to wear this uniform

2212
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:28,500
and pick someone up
at the airport.

2213
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:29,500
Who you picking up?

2214
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:31,800
Hey!

2215
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:46,000
( engine roaring )

2216
01:49:55,900 --> 01:49:57,900
HANRATTY:
South America, Australia

2217
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,500
Singapore, Egypt.

2218
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:01,900
The kid's gone
completely out of control.

2219
01:50:01,900 --> 01:50:03,200
Why wasn't I called?

2220
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:04,400
FOX:
Nobody was called, sir.

2221
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:06,100
The banks didn't know what
was happening till last week.

2222
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:07,300
That's impossible.

2223
01:50:07,300 --> 01:50:09,100
They didn't call
'cause it's not counterfeiting.

2224
01:50:09,100 --> 01:50:10,700
-It's something else.
-Well, what is he doing?

2225
01:50:10,700 --> 01:50:11,900
He's making real checks, sir.

2226
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:12,900
These are so perfect

2227
01:50:12,900 --> 01:50:14,500
the airline didn't know
the difference.

2228
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:16,300
Last check was cashed
in Madrid a week ago.

2229
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:17,500
My guess is he's still there.

2230
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:18,900
We have to leave now, sir.
Today.

2231
01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:20,200
Go where?

2232
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:21,900
Spain? You want to go to Spain?

2233
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:23,500
Well, eventually,
he's got to go back

2234
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:24,600
to where the checks
were printed.

2235
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:26,100
I think that's why
he's moving back through Europe.

2236
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:27,600
Look at the map, sir.
He's making a circle.

2237
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:28,700
He's running out of checks.

2238
01:50:28,700 --> 01:50:30,300
I know it's a...
it's a long shot, sir

2239
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:33,300
but if we track him from Madrid,
sir, we could still catch him.

2240
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:35,200
I'm sorry, Carl,
if you couldn't catch him here

2241
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:36,600
you're not going
to catch him there.

2242
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:38,500
But, sir, we're going
to let him get away.

2243
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:42,100
No, Carl, you let him get away.

2244
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:54,600
( tapping map )

2245
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:28,700
A perfect one-16th
all the way around.

2246
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:30,400
Hmm!

2247
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:33,200
Color separation is flawless.

2248
01:51:35,400 --> 01:51:37,500
There's no bleeding. Hmm.

2249
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:40,200
Nobody does work like this
in the States.

2250
01:51:40,300 --> 01:51:41,600
Nobody but us.

2251
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:43,400
HANRATTY:
Where was it printed?

2252
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:45,700
( chuckling ):
It was printed on a monster...

2253
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:46,700
A monster.

2254
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:48,200
...a Heidelberg, an Istra...

2255
01:51:48,300 --> 01:51:49,400
Heidelberg.

2256
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:51,100
...a dinosaur, four colors.

2257
01:51:51,100 --> 01:51:52,600
You can smell the weight.

2258
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:54,200
Two tons, without the ink.

2259
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:55,700
( inhales, clears throat )

2260
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:57,800
Where do they do printing
like this?

2261
01:51:57,800 --> 01:51:59,400
Germany, Great Britain...

2262
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:00,400
France.

2263
01:52:00,500 --> 01:52:03,200
BOTH PRINTERS:
France!

2264
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:05,400
France. Frank's mother said
the name of a village in France

2265
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:06,700
where they didn't have Sara Lee.

2266
01:52:06,700 --> 01:52:08,200
The village where
she met Frank's father.

2267
01:52:08,300 --> 01:52:09,700
Oh, yeah,
I don't remember, uh...

2268
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:12,400
It started with an M.
It was, uh, "Mont" something.

2269
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:14,400
"Mont." Mr. Fox?

2270
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:15,400
Uh, yes, yes.

2271
01:52:15,400 --> 01:52:16,700
Question: "You met your husband
during the war?"

2272
01:52:16,700 --> 01:52:18,900
Answer: "Yes, I lived
in a small village in France.

2273
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:19,900
Yeah, right.

2274
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,400
"The kind of place where
they never heard of Sara Lee."

2275
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:23,600
Tell me you wrote down the name
of the village, Mr. Fox.

2276
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:26,800
Montrichard.

2277
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:06,700
( rhythmic clattering )

2278
01:53:18,700 --> 01:53:19,900
( bell ringing )

2279
01:53:19,900 --> 01:53:21,500
( thumping and fluttering )

2280
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:22,800
( clattering slows )

2281
01:53:22,900 --> 01:53:23,800
Carl?

2282
01:53:23,900 --> 01:53:25,000
Carl!

2283
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:27,900
Merry Christmas!

2284
01:53:27,900 --> 01:53:31,500
How is it that we're always
talking on Christmas, Carl?

2285
01:53:31,500 --> 01:53:33,300
Every Christmas
I'm talking to you!

2286
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:34,400
( laughing )

2287
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:36,400
Put your shirt on, Frank.
You're under arrest.

2288
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:39,100
Hey, are you hungry?
Do you want some beans, Carl?

2289
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:40,700
They got the best
French beans here.

2290
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:41,900
Here, give these a try.

2291
01:53:41,900 --> 01:53:43,500
There's two dozen French
police officers outside.

2292
01:53:43,600 --> 01:53:44,900
Carl, I gotta tell you,
they're delicious.

2293
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:46,000
They wanted to bring you in.

2294
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,100
You want a bite?

2295
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:48,100
But they needed the help
of an American.

2296
01:53:48,100 --> 01:53:49,300
Are you hungry?
You want a bite?

2297
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:50,700
But I told them
I wouldn't bring them to you

2298
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:52,400
unless I could put the cuffs
on you myself.

2299
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:54,000
Well, you have a gun?
You have a gun?

2300
01:53:54,100 --> 01:53:55,200
-No gun?
-No.

2301
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:56,300
No gun.

2302
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,700
And-and you're...
and you're telling me what?

2303
01:53:59,700 --> 01:54:01,200
There's, uh,
there's uh... ( chuckles )

2304
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:03,600
there's two dozen
French police officers out there

2305
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:04,700
right now on Christmas Eve?

2306
01:54:04,700 --> 01:54:05,900
That's what you're telling me?

2307
01:54:05,900 --> 01:54:07,200
Yeah.

2308
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:08,600
( chuckling ):
All right, all right.

2309
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:09,800
Well, there's no windows here.

2310
01:54:09,900 --> 01:54:12,400
I'm going to take a look
out the front door.

2311
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:13,500
No! No!

2312
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:16,300
I told them I'd walk out first
and give a signal.

2313
01:54:16,300 --> 01:54:17,800
Here, you can
put these on yourself.

2314
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:19,400
No, I can't do that!
I can't do that.

2315
01:54:19,400 --> 01:54:20,500
You know why?

2316
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:21,700
( panting )

2317
01:54:21,700 --> 01:54:23,200
'Cause I think
you're full of shit.

2318
01:54:23,300 --> 01:54:25,700
I don't... I don't think
there's anyone else out there.

2319
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:27,600
I think... I think
it's just me and you.

2320
01:54:27,700 --> 01:54:29,000
That's right.

2321
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
I think it's just me and you,
and you know what?

2322
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:32,700
You're going to have
to catch me yourself!

2323
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:35,400
I wo... we don't have time
for this.

2324
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:37,600
Ah, that's good. That's good.

2325
01:54:37,700 --> 01:54:40,400
Tell me what you want me to see,
huh?

2326
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:41,500
I wouldn't lie to you.

2327
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:43,000
Look, you're wearing
a wedding ring.

2328
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:44,600
You're wearing
a wedding ring, Carl!

2329
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:45,700
You lied to me about that!

2330
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:47,200
Didn't you lie about that?!

2331
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:48,900
You asked me if I had a family.

2332
01:54:48,900 --> 01:54:50,400
I did, but I don't anymore.

2333
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:52,400
( phone ringing )

2334
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:54,800
( anxious breathing )

2335
01:54:57,100 --> 01:54:59,200
( ringing continues )

2336
01:54:59,300 --> 01:55:02,100
Yes? No, no, no,
there is no problem.

2337
01:55:02,100 --> 01:55:03,600
We're coming out right now.

2338
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:04,800
( laughing )

2339
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:06,500
Whoa, that was good.
That was good.

2340
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:09,000
What, did you...
you pay some hotel desk clerk

2341
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:10,600
to make that call for you,
is that what you did?

2342
01:55:10,700 --> 01:55:11,600
It was Captain Luc.

2343
01:55:11,700 --> 01:55:13,400
I've got one minute
to bring you out.

2344
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:14,900
Captain Luc? Captain Luc!

2345
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:16,100
Ooh, Captain Luc.

2346
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:17,200
Well, Carl, I gotta say

2347
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:18,700
that-that sounds
pretty official to me

2348
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:20,900
but like I said, I...
I think it's just

2349
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:22,800
me and you here,
it's me and you.

2350
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:23,900
So you're going to have
to catch me.

2351
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,100
Frank. Frank!

2352
01:55:25,100 --> 01:55:26,700
You have to trust me on this!

2353
01:55:26,700 --> 01:55:29,400
These people
have been embarrassed, Frank.

2354
01:55:29,500 --> 01:55:30,600
They're angry.

2355
01:55:30,700 --> 01:55:32,400
You rob their banks,
you steal their money

2356
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:33,500
you live in their country.

2357
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:35,400
I told you this was
what was going to happen

2358
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:37,200
that there was no other way
for it to end.

2359
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:40,000
Don't make a mistake!

2360
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,100
That's good.

2361
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:43,500
That's good, Carl, you know?

2362
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:44,500
Keep pushing that lie.

2363
01:55:44,500 --> 01:55:45,500
Keep pushing it.

2364
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:47,100
Keep pushing
till you make it true.

2365
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:49,700
They're going to kill you!

2366
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:52,400
You walk out that door,
they're going to kill you.

2367
01:55:52,400 --> 01:55:54,400
( panting )

2368
01:55:57,300 --> 01:55:59,600
Is that the truth?

2369
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:05,500
Yeah.

2370
01:56:09,400 --> 01:56:12,000
You have any children, Carl?

2371
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,800
I have a four-year-old daughter.

2372
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:18,400
You swear on your daughter?

2373
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:22,900
You swear?

2374
01:56:27,100 --> 01:56:30,400
You swear?

2375
01:56:30,500 --> 01:56:32,600
( handcuffs clacking )

2376
01:57:00,200 --> 01:57:02,300
That was really good, Carl.

2377
01:57:02,300 --> 01:57:05,200
( car approaching )

2378
01:57:05,300 --> 01:57:07,200
( sirens blaring )

2379
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:09,300
( chorus continues singing )

2380
01:57:09,300 --> 01:57:10,600
( tires screeching )

2381
01:57:10,700 --> 01:57:12,000
( officer shouting in French )

2382
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,000
I have him in custody.

2383
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,200
I got him.

2384
01:57:14,300 --> 01:57:15,900
I got him! It's all right!

2385
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,300
( shouting continues )

2386
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:18,500
It's all right!

2387
01:57:18,500 --> 01:57:20,300
I got him!

2388
01:57:20,300 --> 01:57:21,300
( speaking in French )

2389
01:57:21,400 --> 01:57:23,200
( officer shouting excitedly )

2390
01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:25,600
Hey, I want it...
I want it on the record.

2391
01:57:25,700 --> 01:57:28,300
Frank Abagnale surrendered
of his own accord.

2392
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:30,800
Understood? Understood?

2393
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:31,800
Where are you taking him?

2394
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:32,800
( speaking in French )

2395
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:33,700
I'm... I'm supposed to go.

2396
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:35,500
Where are you taking him?

2397
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:36,800
Let me in the...

2398
01:57:36,900 --> 01:57:37,800
Let me in the car!

2399
01:57:37,900 --> 01:57:38,900
( shouting continues )

2400
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,200
Hey! Let me in the car!

2401
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:43,500
( engine starts )

2402
01:57:43,600 --> 01:57:44,700
Don't worry, Frank!

2403
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:46,800
I'll have you extradited
back to the United States.

2404
01:57:46,900 --> 01:57:47,900
Don't worry.

2405
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,500
( siren wailing )

2406
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:11,300
Carl...

2407
01:58:11,300 --> 01:58:14,400
Carl, you have to remember

2408
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:17,500
to let me call my father
when we land.

2409
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:19,500
I just want to,
I want to talk to him

2410
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:22,600
before he sees me on television
or something like that.

2411
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:34,100
Carl, look.

2412
01:58:34,100 --> 01:58:36,100
That's LaGuardia right there.

2413
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:37,900
Runway 4-4.

2414
01:58:37,900 --> 01:58:40,600
Frank, your father is dead.

2415
01:58:40,600 --> 01:58:42,600
I'm sorry.

2416
01:58:42,600 --> 01:58:46,200
I didn't want to say anything
till we got closer to home.

2417
01:58:46,300 --> 01:58:51,000
He-He... He fell down some steps
at Grand Central Station

2418
01:58:51,100 --> 01:58:53,100
trying to catch a train.

2419
01:58:53,100 --> 01:58:55,400
I didn't want to be the one
to tell you.

2420
01:58:55,500 --> 01:58:58,800
You're lying, right?

2421
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:01,100
You said I could talk to him.

2422
01:59:01,100 --> 01:59:02,800
Carl, who are you to...

2423
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:04,800
who are you to say
something like that, huh?

2424
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:06,600
Who are you
to say something like that?

2425
01:59:06,700 --> 01:59:07,800
You said I could talk to him.

2426
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:09,600
He fell, and he...
and he broke his neck.

2427
01:59:09,600 --> 01:59:10,800
I'm sorry.

2428
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:13,100
I'm really sorry.

2429
01:59:21,200 --> 01:59:24,200
( panting )

2430
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:25,500
( hits seat )

2431
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:27,200
( sobbing ):
Goddamn it!

2432
01:59:27,300 --> 01:59:29,800
Carl, I'm going to be sick!

2433
01:59:29,900 --> 01:59:30,800
-( people muttering )
-It's all right.

2434
01:59:30,900 --> 01:59:31,900
It's all right. It's okay.

2435
01:59:31,900 --> 01:59:33,300
Carl, I got to go
to the bathroom.

2436
01:59:33,300 --> 01:59:34,300
I'm going to be sick.

2437
01:59:34,300 --> 01:59:36,100
Sure.
Let's go in the bathroom.

2438
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:39,500
( panting )

2439
01:59:43,200 --> 01:59:44,500
Goddamn it!

2440
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:48,500
( sobbing )

2441
01:59:48,500 --> 01:59:50,100
( pounding )

2442
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:51,500
( murmuring )

2443
01:59:51,600 --> 01:59:54,100
( panting )

2444
01:59:54,200 --> 01:59:56,200
( panting slows )

2445
01:59:57,600 --> 01:59:59,500
( Frank panting )

2446
02:00:02,100 --> 02:00:05,100
( whispering ):
Oh, Daddy...

2447
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:09,200
You'll have take your seat, sir.

2448
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:10,800
I've told you twice.
We're landing.

2449
02:00:10,900 --> 02:00:12,300
-Sorry. Thank you...
-All of you.

2450
02:00:12,300 --> 02:00:13,500
Frank! Come on now.

2451
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:15,600
-Frank?
-We're landing in six minutes.

2452
02:00:15,700 --> 02:00:16,800
All of you need to be
in your seats

2453
02:00:16,900 --> 02:00:19,000
-with your seat belts fastened.
-Frank, open the door!

2454
02:00:19,100 --> 02:00:20,700
Frank!

2455
02:00:22,500 --> 02:00:24,200
-You do it.
-Yeah.

2456
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:39,000
( engines decelerating )

2457
02:00:45,500 --> 02:00:47,900
( grunting )

2458
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:52,100
( frustrated sigh )

2459
02:00:52,100 --> 02:00:53,500
( grunting )

2460
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:55,500
Frank! Frank!

2461
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:57,500
( engines roaring )

2462
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:59,800
( tires squealing )

2463
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:02,400
HANRATTY:
All right, remain seated,
everyone, please.

2464
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:04,300
FBI. Stay seated.
FBI. Stay seated.

2465
02:01:04,300 --> 02:01:07,400
( engines whining )

2466
02:01:12,700 --> 02:01:14,100
-please remain seated!
-Stay seated.

2467
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:15,400
STEWARDESS:
You must stay seated

2468
02:01:15,500 --> 02:01:18,000
until the aircraft
has come to a complete stop.

2469
02:01:18,100 --> 02:01:19,600
HANRATTY:
God almighty.

2470
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:26,400
( panting )

2471
02:01:57,800 --> 02:02:00,100
( quietly blowing notes )

2472
02:02:08,700 --> 02:02:10,600
What's your name?

2473
02:02:10,700 --> 02:02:11,700
( blows note )

2474
02:02:13,900 --> 02:02:17,400
Where's your mommy?

2475
02:02:22,100 --> 02:02:25,000
( blows note )

2476
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:36,100
( brakes squeaking )

2477
02:02:41,300 --> 02:02:44,400
( men shouting indistinctly )

2478
02:02:57,800 --> 02:02:59,500
Hands behind your head!

2479
02:03:01,600 --> 02:03:03,000
Carl, get me in the car,
please.

2480
02:03:03,100 --> 02:03:06,200
Get me in the car.

2481
02:03:06,300 --> 02:03:08,200
HANRATTY:
Put him in.

2482
02:03:08,300 --> 02:03:11,200
( piano playing interlude
in "The Christmas Song" )

2483
02:03:11,300 --> 02:03:13,300
( handcuffs latching )

2484
02:03:24,300 --> 02:03:27,800
JUDGE:
Taking into account
the gravity of these crimes

2485
02:03:27,900 --> 02:03:31,700
yourhistory ofbold
and elusive behavior

2486
02:03:31,700 --> 02:03:34,100
and your complete lack
ofrespect

2487
02:03:34,200 --> 02:03:36,600
for the laws
of the United States

2488
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:39,700
l have no choice
but to ignore yourrequest

2489
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:41,700
to be treated as a minor

2490
02:03:41,700 --> 02:03:43,600
and sentence you to 12 years

2491
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:46,900
in Atlanta's
maximum securityprison

2492
02:03:46,900 --> 02:03:50,200
and recommend strongly
thatyou be kept in isolation

2493
02:03:50,300 --> 02:03:52,300
for the entirety
of that sentence.

2494
02:03:55,900 --> 02:03:59,500
( song ends with guitarplaying
"Jingle Bells" riff )

2495
02:04:04,900 --> 02:04:06,700
Use that door over there.

2496
02:04:06,700 --> 02:04:09,200
( phone ringing )

2497
02:04:09,300 --> 02:04:12,300
( indistinct voices )

2498
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:14,300
PRISONER:
...and give everyone my love.

2499
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:16,100
I think about them all the time.

2500
02:04:26,700 --> 02:04:28,800
( indistinct conversations
in distance )

2501
02:04:33,300 --> 02:04:34,600
( sighs deeply )

2502
02:04:34,600 --> 02:04:37,000
Merry Christmas, Frank.

2503
02:04:39,400 --> 02:04:42,000
Hey, I got you
some comic books here.

2504
02:04:48,700 --> 02:04:50,000
How's your daughter?

2505
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,300
What was her name?

2506
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:52,300
Grace.

2507
02:04:52,300 --> 02:04:54,400
Well... I don't know.

2508
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:55,800
She lives with her mother
in Chicago

2509
02:04:55,800 --> 02:04:57,800
and I don't get to see her much.

2510
02:04:59,300 --> 02:05:00,900
What's in the briefcase?

2511
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,400
Oh. I'm on my way
to the airport.

2512
02:05:03,400 --> 02:05:05,700
It's a paperhanger

2513
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:07,200
who's working his way
through Minnesota.

2514
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:08,600
( chuckling )

2515
02:05:08,600 --> 02:05:12,100
Aw, geez, he's...
he's driving us crazy.

2516
02:05:12,200 --> 02:05:13,700
You got any of the checks?

2517
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:16,300
Yeah, yeah, I got a...
a counterfeit that he drew

2518
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:18,100
on the Great Lakes
Savings and Loan.

2519
02:05:18,200 --> 02:05:20,600
See, he's just using
a stencil machine

2520
02:05:20,600 --> 02:05:21,800
and an Underwood.

2521
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:24,300
Yeah, it's a teller at the bank.

2522
02:05:24,300 --> 02:05:25,600
Say again?

2523
02:05:25,700 --> 02:05:27,300
I-It's definitely a teller,
Carl.

2524
02:05:27,300 --> 02:05:29,400
I mean, banks,
they always use hand-stamps

2525
02:05:29,400 --> 02:05:30,900
for the dates, see.

2526
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:32,600
They get used
over and over again

2527
02:05:32,700 --> 02:05:34,100
so they always get worn out

2528
02:05:34,200 --> 02:05:36,000
and the numbers
are always cracking.

2529
02:05:36,100 --> 02:05:39,800
The sixes and the nines...
see, they go first.

2530
02:05:41,800 --> 02:05:43,700
Thanks.

2531
02:05:43,700 --> 02:05:45,700
( buzzer sounding )

2532
02:05:48,300 --> 02:05:50,400
MAN:
l'd like you to take a look

2533
02:05:50,500 --> 02:05:51,500
at something forme.

2534
02:05:56,100 --> 02:05:58,400
Tell me what you think.

2535
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:00,900
( clears throat )

2536
02:06:00,900 --> 02:06:02,500
That's a fake.

2537
02:06:02,500 --> 02:06:04,100
How do you know?

2538
02:06:04,100 --> 02:06:05,300
You haven't looked at it.

2539
02:06:05,300 --> 02:06:07,800
Well, there's
no perforated edge, right?

2540
02:06:07,900 --> 02:06:10,900
I mean, this... this check
was hand-cut, not fed.

2541
02:06:10,900 --> 02:06:13,100
Yeah...

2542
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:14,400
Paper is double-bonded

2543
02:06:14,500 --> 02:06:16,800
much too heavy
to be a bank check.

2544
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:20,800
Magnetic ink, it's, uh,
raised against my fingers

2545
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:22,100
instead of flat.

2546
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:23,300
( sniffing )

2547
02:06:23,300 --> 02:06:24,800
And this doesn't smell
like MICR.

2548
02:06:24,900 --> 02:06:25,900
It's some kind of a...

2549
02:06:25,900 --> 02:06:27,700
you know,
some kind of a drafting ink.

2550
02:06:27,700 --> 02:06:30,000
You know, the kind you get
at a stationery store.

2551
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:31,300
( clears throat )

2552
02:06:33,900 --> 02:06:35,900
( paper rustling )

2553
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,800
Frank...

2554
02:06:37,900 --> 02:06:39,800
would you be interested
in working

2555
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:41,900
with the FBI's
Financial Crimes Unit?

2556
02:06:41,900 --> 02:06:43,900
( shuffles cards )

2557
02:06:43,900 --> 02:06:44,900
I already got a job here.

2558
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:46,400
You know, I, uh,
deliver the mail.

2559
02:06:48,500 --> 02:06:53,300
Frank, we have the power
to take you out of prison.

2560
02:06:53,300 --> 02:06:55,000
You'd be placed
in the custody of the FBI

2561
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,100
where you'd serve out
the remainder of your sentence

2562
02:06:57,200 --> 02:06:58,900
as an employee
of the federal government.

2563
02:07:01,600 --> 02:07:03,700
Under whose custody?

2564
02:07:09,800 --> 02:07:12,400
( phone ringing )

2565
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:15,100
Hi. I-I'm Frank Abagnale.

2566
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:17,600
I'm supposed to start work
here today.

2567
02:07:17,700 --> 02:07:20,300
It's a tour company
operating out of the BVI.

2568
02:07:20,300 --> 02:07:22,500
Sir, Mr. Abagnale is here.

2569
02:07:22,500 --> 02:07:24,000
I'm going to call you back.

2570
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,800
( melancholy melody playing )

2571
02:07:54,300 --> 02:07:56,200
Hello, Carl.

2572
02:07:56,300 --> 02:07:57,900
Welcome to the FBI.

2573
02:07:57,900 --> 02:08:00,000
I'll show you
where you're working.

2574
02:08:07,300 --> 02:08:10,800
Carl... how long
do I have to work here?

2575
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:13,500
It's 8:15 in the morning
to 5:00 in the afternoon.

2576
02:08:13,500 --> 02:08:15,500
45 minutes for lunch.

2577
02:08:15,500 --> 02:08:17,500
No, I...

2578
02:08:17,600 --> 02:08:19,800
I mean, how long?

2579
02:08:21,600 --> 02:08:23,700
Every day.

2580
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:26,000
Every day, Frank,
till we let you go.

2581
02:09:17,800 --> 02:09:20,000
-( tapping )
-Yeah.

2582
02:09:20,100 --> 02:09:23,000
-Hey, Carl.
-Hi.

2583
02:09:23,100 --> 02:09:25,400
How you doing?

2584
02:09:25,400 --> 02:09:26,800
It's not a good time, Frank.

2585
02:09:26,900 --> 02:09:28,800
I'm clearing my desk
for the weekend.

2586
02:09:31,800 --> 02:09:34,700
Carl, you mind if I come
to work with you tomorrow?

2587
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:36,800
Tomorrow is Saturday.

2588
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:38,900
I'm flying to Chicago
to see my daughter.

2589
02:09:38,900 --> 02:09:40,500
I'll be back to work on Monday.

2590
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:41,700
You're going to see Grace, huh?

2591
02:09:41,700 --> 02:09:43,300
Well, that's the plan.

2592
02:09:45,900 --> 02:09:47,000
( heavy sigh )

2593
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,200
So what should I do till Monday?

2594
02:09:49,300 --> 02:09:51,000
I'm sorry, kid,
I can't help you there.

2595
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:52,100
Excuse me.

2596
02:09:55,100 --> 02:09:58,800
( phone rings )

2597
02:09:58,900 --> 02:10:01,300
This is Hanratty.

2598
02:10:01,300 --> 02:10:03,300
Oh, yeah, put him on.

2599
02:10:11,300 --> 02:10:13,300
Mr. Sawyer.

2600
02:10:13,300 --> 02:10:15,200
How are you?

2601
02:10:15,200 --> 02:10:17,200
I have a half a dozen
more checks

2602
02:10:17,300 --> 02:10:19,300
on that tour operator
at the BVI.

2603
02:10:26,400 --> 02:10:28,400
( laughs quietly )

2604
02:10:42,100 --> 02:10:44,100
( opens and shuts drawer )

2605
02:10:52,500 --> 02:10:55,200
WOMAN ( over P.A. ):
American Airlines 355

2606
02:10:55,300 --> 02:10:57,600
serving Chicago
and San Francisco

2607
02:10:57,700 --> 02:10:59,400
is now open
for passenger check-in.

2608
02:10:59,400 --> 02:11:02,700
How'd you do it, Frank?

2609
02:11:02,700 --> 02:11:06,000
How'd you pass the bar
in Louisiana?

2610
02:11:06,100 --> 02:11:08,500
What are you doing here?

2611
02:11:08,500 --> 02:11:10,600
Listen...

2612
02:11:10,600 --> 02:11:12,700
I'm sorry I put you
through all this.

2613
02:11:12,700 --> 02:11:15,700
You go back to Europe, you're
gonna die in Perpignan Prison.

2614
02:11:15,700 --> 02:11:17,300
You try to run
here in the States

2615
02:11:17,300 --> 02:11:19,500
we'll send you
back to Atlanta for 50 years.

2616
02:11:19,500 --> 02:11:22,900
I know that.

2617
02:11:22,900 --> 02:11:25,400
I spent four years trying
to arrange your release.

2618
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:27,200
Had to convince my bosses
at the FBI

2619
02:11:27,200 --> 02:11:29,500
and the Attorney General
of the United States

2620
02:11:29,500 --> 02:11:30,500
you wouldn't run.

2621
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:33,400
Why'd you do it?

2622
02:11:33,500 --> 02:11:34,900
You're just a kid.

2623
02:11:34,900 --> 02:11:36,700
I'm not your kid.

2624
02:11:36,700 --> 02:11:39,100
You said you were
going to Chicago.

2625
02:11:39,200 --> 02:11:41,100
My daughter can't see me
this weekend.

2626
02:11:41,200 --> 02:11:43,100
She's going skiing.

2627
02:11:43,200 --> 02:11:44,700
You said she was four years old.

2628
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:45,900
You're lying.

2629
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:47,500
She was four when I left.

2630
02:11:47,600 --> 02:11:49,000
Now she's 15.

2631
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:52,200
My wife's been remarried
for 1 1 years.

2632
02:11:52,200 --> 02:11:54,500
I see Grace every now and again.

2633
02:11:54,500 --> 02:11:56,500
I don't understand.

2634
02:11:56,500 --> 02:11:58,500
Sure you do.

2635
02:11:58,500 --> 02:12:01,200
Sometimes it's easier
living the lie.

2636
02:12:04,600 --> 02:12:07,600
I'm going to let you
fly tonight, Frank.

2637
02:12:07,600 --> 02:12:09,500
I'm not even going
to try to stop you.

2638
02:12:09,500 --> 02:12:11,900
That's 'cause I know
you'll be back on Monday.

2639
02:12:11,900 --> 02:12:15,300
Yeah? How do you know
I'll come back?

2640
02:12:15,300 --> 02:12:18,000
( chuckles quietly )

2641
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,300
Look.

2642
02:12:20,300 --> 02:12:22,200
Frank...

2643
02:12:22,300 --> 02:12:24,600
nobody's chasing you.

2644
02:12:24,700 --> 02:12:28,200
WOMAN ( over P.A. ):
American Airlines flight 131

2645
02:12:28,200 --> 02:12:31,100
to Pittsburgh
is now ready for boarding.

2646
02:12:31,100 --> 02:12:35,900
Passengers with boarding passes,
please proceed to Gate 23A.

2647
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:44,700
Okay.

2648
02:12:44,800 --> 02:12:47,000
Alice, has he still not called?

2649
02:12:47,100 --> 02:12:49,000
No, he hasn't.

2650
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:01,700
HANRATTY:
Good morning.

2651
02:13:01,700 --> 02:13:03,800
I've, uh, called this meeting
to discuss

2652
02:13:03,800 --> 02:13:06,100
a new type of check fraud
and counterfeiting

2653
02:13:06,200 --> 02:13:08,600
which the unsub is washing
and altering checks

2654
02:13:08,600 --> 02:13:10,600
then passing them
throughout Arizona.

2655
02:13:10,600 --> 02:13:14,700
( panting )

2656
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:16,400
This unsub is a big dog

2657
02:13:16,400 --> 02:13:18,500
passing checks
as large as five figures.

2658
02:13:18,600 --> 02:13:20,400
( door opening )

2659
02:13:21,900 --> 02:13:24,900
Sorry I'm late.

2660
02:13:24,900 --> 02:13:26,900
Sorry.

2661
02:13:30,600 --> 02:13:34,000
We have a recovered check
on Agent Reiter's desk.

2662
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
Why don't we step out
to the bullpen?

2663
02:13:40,400 --> 02:13:44,300
There's impressions
on every line.

2664
02:13:44,300 --> 02:13:48,100
Looks like the original amount
was for $60.

2665
02:13:51,800 --> 02:13:53,100
Mind if I take a look?

2666
02:13:56,600 --> 02:13:59,500
Cashed in Flagstaff a week ago.

2667
02:14:01,400 --> 02:14:04,300
Cost the bank $16,000.

2668
02:14:04,400 --> 02:14:06,300
It's a real check.

2669
02:14:06,400 --> 02:14:08,400
Yeah.

2670
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:09,600
Yeah. It's been washed.

2671
02:14:09,600 --> 02:14:11,600
The only thing original
is the signature.

2672
02:14:11,600 --> 02:14:13,500
But it's perfect, Carl.
I mean...

2673
02:14:13,500 --> 02:14:15,800
I mean, this isn't hydrochloride
or bleach.

2674
02:14:15,900 --> 02:14:18,200
No.

2675
02:14:18,200 --> 02:14:19,900
Something new.

2676
02:14:19,900 --> 02:14:22,000
Maybe a nail polish remover
where the acetone

2677
02:14:22,100 --> 02:14:24,000
removes the ink
that's not been printed?

2678
02:14:28,100 --> 02:14:31,100
How did you do it, Frank?

2679
02:14:31,100 --> 02:14:34,100
How did you cheat
on the bar exam in Louisiana?

2680
02:14:39,500 --> 02:14:42,700
I didn't cheat.

2681
02:14:42,700 --> 02:14:46,400
I studied for two weeks
and I passed.

2682
02:14:47,400 --> 02:14:49,700
Is that the truth, Frank?

2683
02:14:49,800 --> 02:14:52,000
Is that the truth?

2684
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,600
I'll bet this guy steals checks
out of mailboxes.

2685
02:14:54,600 --> 02:14:57,200
He washes off their names
and he puts on his own.

2686
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,300
You're saying that he's a local?

2687
02:15:01,300 --> 02:15:02,600
Well, if it were me, you know

2688
02:15:02,600 --> 02:15:04,900
I'd call the bank first,
I'd check out the balance...

2689
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:06,600
Make sure there's enough money
in there

2690
02:15:06,600 --> 02:15:07,800
to make it worth your while.

2691
02:15:07,900 --> 02:15:09,000
Exactly.

2692
02:15:09,100 --> 02:15:11,100
You know, Carl, I think
this guy's pretty smart.

2693
02:15:11,100 --> 02:15:12,500
( laughs )

2694
02:15:12,500 --> 02:15:14,900
I guess all we have to do now
is catch him.

2695
02:15:16,700 --> 02:15:19,100
We'll start first thing
in the morning.

2696
02:15:19,100 --> 02:15:21,600
We'll run the name
Eric Anthony Feeders.

2697
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:23,600
In Nevada, Arizona, California.

2698
02:15:23,600 --> 02:15:25,800
Both names, right?
Chris Frank, too?

2699
02:15:25,900 --> 02:15:27,800
Yeah...

2700
02:15:27,900 --> 02:15:30,900
( discussion continues
indistinctly )

2701
02:15:40,900 --> 02:15:43,900
( orchestra playing
whimsicaljazzy theme )

2702
02:20:41,900 --> 02:20:44,900
( music ends )
