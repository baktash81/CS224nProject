00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,673
Asomidin Tohirov?

3
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,923
I did it yesterday.

4
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,465
It's my third time.

5
00:01:35,298 --> 00:01:36,465
Want me to go?

6
00:01:38,923 --> 00:01:40,840
No, I will.
You can sleep.

7
00:01:53,257 --> 00:01:54,298
Yum... here.

8
00:01:54,465 --> 00:01:56,382
- Hot?
- No, it's not.

9
00:01:58,257 --> 00:01:59,882
I said you could sleep.

10
00:02:00,048 --> 00:02:01,215
I couldn't.

11
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,840
You okay, Leo?

12
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:04,090
Too hot?

13
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,257
Yes.

14
00:02:07,257 --> 00:02:08,507
This way I see you.

15
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,507
We don't see much of Mommy
these days.

16
00:02:20,257 --> 00:02:22,923
We meet at my mom's or here?

17
00:02:24,048 --> 00:02:25,048
It's tonight?

18
00:02:26,465 --> 00:02:28,757
Virginie, you're a fucking pain.

19
00:02:52,257 --> 00:02:54,298
Is your partner coming along?

20
00:02:54,715 --> 00:02:55,757
No.

21
00:02:58,132 --> 00:03:01,173
Do you have anyone
to accompany you?

22
00:03:01,423 --> 00:03:02,423
No.

23
00:03:04,048 --> 00:03:05,840
Tonight, antibiotics

24
00:03:06,007 --> 00:03:08,923
to prevent infection
during the procedure.

25
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:54,007
Have a good day.

26
00:03:54,173 --> 00:03:55,173
Thanks.

27
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,215
What's your problem?

28
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,382
You do things offhandedly.

29
00:04:10,548 --> 00:04:13,090
- You're imprecise, careless.
- And on the ground?

30
00:04:13,257 --> 00:04:14,257
Am I a good cop?

31
00:04:14,757 --> 00:04:17,173
Answer me.
Am I good on the ground?

32
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,007
Yeah.

33
00:04:18,173 --> 00:04:20,132
So? Why are you railing?

34
00:04:20,507 --> 00:04:21,965
I'm not Oxford Unabridged!

35
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,007
I'm a cop.
I'm not here to write a novel.

36
00:04:30,007 --> 00:04:31,632
All good, Miss Norway?

37
00:04:32,965 --> 00:04:34,173
What's wrong?

38
00:04:39,673 --> 00:04:40,673
Virginie?

39
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,673
Are you free?

40
00:04:43,673 --> 00:04:44,882
Yeah, why?

41
00:04:45,673 --> 00:04:48,757
To get this woman's belongings.
Violent husband.

42
00:04:49,215 --> 00:04:51,507
He's not in.
Can you come along?

43
00:05:11,048 --> 00:05:12,382
It'll be fine, ma'am.

44
00:05:15,298 --> 00:05:16,465
We're here.

45
00:05:26,965 --> 00:05:28,298
- What the fuck?
- Step back.

46
00:05:28,465 --> 00:05:29,465
Step back.

47
00:05:29,632 --> 00:05:31,257
Sonia, come on...

48
00:05:31,423 --> 00:05:32,507
Sir, over there.

49
00:05:33,798 --> 00:05:35,340
- I can't talk to her?
- No.

50
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,298
Back up and stay put.

51
00:05:45,715 --> 00:05:46,882
Bitch.

52
00:05:51,132 --> 00:05:52,340
Little whore.

53
00:05:56,257 --> 00:05:57,882
Go wash, dirty whore.

54
00:05:58,965 --> 00:06:00,257
Feel better now?

55
00:06:01,423 --> 00:06:03,048
You're cumming, right?

56
00:06:03,215 --> 00:06:04,965
Your uniform gets you off.

57
00:06:05,257 --> 00:06:07,257
Stop pretending you have balls.

58
00:06:11,423 --> 00:06:12,882
I've had enough now.

59
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,715
Let go! Let go, I said!

60
00:06:16,215 --> 00:06:17,298
Will you let go?

61
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,798
Bitch!

62
00:06:38,548 --> 00:06:39,757
Miss Norway!

63
00:06:40,715 --> 00:06:42,882
Aristide, stop calling me that.

64
00:06:43,048 --> 00:06:45,673
What?
Would you prefer Miss Senegal?

65
00:06:46,923 --> 00:06:48,798
I have an important question.

66
00:06:49,382 --> 00:06:50,632
Primordial.

67
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,215
What do we do for lunch?

68
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:56,757
Kebab or kebab?

69
00:06:57,882 --> 00:06:59,840
Be happy.
I'm leaving you the choice.

70
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:01,757
I can't. I have work.

71
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:03,382
Cheating on me?

72
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,048
Eating with another man?

73
00:07:09,798 --> 00:07:10,798
Okay, then.

74
00:07:33,048 --> 00:07:35,382
<i>Backup requested by the riverbank.</i>

75
00:07:35,548 --> 00:07:37,007
<i>36 Quai d'Austerlitz.</i>

76
00:07:37,173 --> 00:07:38,173
<i>Do you copy?</i>

77
00:07:41,048 --> 00:07:42,048
Cool.

78
00:07:42,257 --> 00:07:43,882
Time to kick some ass.

79
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:45,340
Sounds likely.

80
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,590
Good sex last night.

81
00:07:47,882 --> 00:07:49,673
And a good fight today.

82
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,340
You gonna help?

83
00:08:37,257 --> 00:08:38,340
Don't move!

84
00:08:46,548 --> 00:08:47,798
Nice workout!

85
00:08:49,882 --> 00:08:52,090
What happened?
Rip your pantyhose?

86
00:08:52,507 --> 00:08:54,423
I haven't slept in 18 months.

87
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,590
So?

88
00:08:57,007 --> 00:08:58,632
That's women for you.

89
00:08:59,465 --> 00:09:00,715
You want equality

90
00:09:00,882 --> 00:09:04,340
then you play the mother card
or the period card.

91
00:09:04,507 --> 00:09:05,590
Seriously.

92
00:09:06,173 --> 00:09:09,215
- Leave your ovaries at home.
- Lay off!

93
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,798
Not today, not you.

94
00:09:10,965 --> 00:09:12,007
Why "not me"?

95
00:09:12,882 --> 00:09:15,090
- What did I do?
- You did nothing.

96
00:09:15,757 --> 00:09:17,173
So what is it?

97
00:09:18,507 --> 00:09:20,173
I'm getting an abortion.

98
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,257
I couldn't leave my ovaries at home.
Sorry.

99
00:09:26,173 --> 00:09:30,007
It's not your fault.
I forgot my pill, one fucking time.

100
00:09:30,173 --> 00:09:31,173
Here we are.

101
00:09:32,882 --> 00:09:34,173
You sure it's mine?

102
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,173
I'm sure all right.

103
00:09:37,548 --> 00:09:39,965
I'll spare you the details.
100% sure.

104
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,965
<i>- It won't work!
- Why not?</i>

105
00:10:04,132 --> 00:10:07,340
<i>You can't have
more than one girl in a car.</i>

106
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:08,757
<i>I know.</i>

107
00:10:08,923 --> 00:10:11,257
It's the rule
but rules change.

108
00:10:11,423 --> 00:10:14,507
Two girls can't patrol without a man.

109
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,298
Am I not right?

110
00:10:19,423 --> 00:10:20,423
It's the rule!

111
00:10:23,382 --> 00:10:25,840
- How do you make a cop?
- Tell us.

112
00:10:26,007 --> 00:10:27,340
One man minimum.

113
00:10:28,298 --> 00:10:30,632
Takes more than a woman alone.

114
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:34,132
- And two women?
- Not even two women!

115
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,215
You're unbelievable!

116
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:38,757
Machos like you still exist?

117
00:10:38,923 --> 00:10:41,465
It's the truth.
One man minimum!

118
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,382
I need two officers to volunteer.

119
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,298
It's not our sector

120
00:11:22,465 --> 00:11:24,257
and it means doing overtime.

121
00:11:24,423 --> 00:11:27,590
The prison fire
has Escort Crew scrambling.

122
00:11:28,048 --> 00:11:29,048
Gregoire?

123
00:11:30,048 --> 00:11:31,507
No, sorry.

124
00:11:34,465 --> 00:11:35,548
Aristide?

125
00:11:36,173 --> 00:11:37,298
No way.

126
00:11:37,465 --> 00:11:39,007
I have a life, unlike others.

127
00:11:42,257 --> 00:11:43,382
Erik? Up for it?

128
00:11:43,548 --> 00:11:45,673
Okay, but they have some nerve.

129
00:11:47,465 --> 00:11:49,882
I'll do it. I'll go along.

130
00:11:50,507 --> 00:11:51,923
I had nothing to do with it.

131
00:11:52,673 --> 00:11:54,007
No, it doesn't suit me.

132
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,590
I told you I wasn't sure.

133
00:11:57,757 --> 00:12:00,090
An emergency is an emergency!

134
00:12:01,632 --> 00:12:02,632
Hello?

135
00:12:46,548 --> 00:12:47,923
- You okay?
- Fine.

136
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,757
I need to search the car.

137
00:12:50,132 --> 00:12:51,423
You never know.

138
00:12:59,757 --> 00:13:00,757
See?

139
00:13:01,257 --> 00:13:03,215
This can become a weapon.

140
00:13:06,173 --> 00:13:07,632
Anything can.

141
00:13:08,715 --> 00:13:10,423
What's Herve doing?

142
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,132
<i>Where did you put them?</i>

143
00:13:38,548 --> 00:13:39,965
Not in there.

144
00:13:41,257 --> 00:13:42,923
You're a pain, Martine.

145
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,507
You're a pain in the ass, you know.

146
00:13:47,298 --> 00:13:49,423
Can't you stop busting my balls?

147
00:13:49,673 --> 00:13:50,673
Freezing.

148
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:53,548
No, cold.

149
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,715
Don't come crying
when you get cancer.

150
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,757
Don't count on me
to take you for chemo.

151
00:14:06,382 --> 00:14:08,382
Why are you always so nasty?

152
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,548
Why take it out on me?

153
00:14:11,715 --> 00:14:14,507
If we'd had a kid,
I'd take it out on him.

154
00:14:18,715 --> 00:14:21,257
But it's all muscle, no balls.

155
00:14:33,923 --> 00:14:35,757
I grab the guy and say:

156
00:14:35,923 --> 00:14:37,173
"I'll whip your ass

157
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,965
next time you call me 'bro'..."

158
00:14:39,132 --> 00:14:40,132
<i>You upset?</i>

159
00:14:40,215 --> 00:14:40,965
His bro?

160
00:14:41,132 --> 00:14:42,715
From what mother?

161
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,882
Can you take it down?

162
00:14:45,173 --> 00:14:46,423
You're not happy?

163
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,090
No, I'm not!

164
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,715
You know why?

165
00:14:50,007 --> 00:14:53,090
Your robbery report is full of mistakes.

166
00:14:53,757 --> 00:14:56,673
Stop nitpicking. They're just typos.

167
00:14:57,465 --> 00:15:00,840
Want me to write my reports
in sonnet form?

168
00:15:01,548 --> 00:15:02,673
Enough already.

169
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,840
What's your problem?

170
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,382
You do everything offhandedly.

171
00:15:07,548 --> 00:15:09,340
You're imprecise, careless.

172
00:15:10,132 --> 00:15:11,298
And on the ground?

173
00:15:12,048 --> 00:15:13,507
Am I a good cop?

174
00:15:15,257 --> 00:15:17,132
Answer me.
On the ground?

175
00:15:18,965 --> 00:15:20,173
Am I a good cop?

176
00:15:20,548 --> 00:15:21,548
Yeah.

177
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,007
So why are you railing?
I'm not Oxford Unabridged.

178
00:15:26,632 --> 00:15:30,132
I'm a cop.
I'm not here to write a novel.

179
00:15:31,673 --> 00:15:34,673
Take her to her place.
All her stuff is there.

180
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,048
All right, I'll deal with it.

181
00:15:39,215 --> 00:15:40,215
Virginie...

182
00:15:40,757 --> 00:15:42,048
Are you free?

183
00:15:42,215 --> 00:15:43,548
Yeah, why?

184
00:15:44,298 --> 00:15:46,548
To get this woman's belongings.

185
00:15:46,715 --> 00:15:48,090
Violent husband.

186
00:15:48,257 --> 00:15:50,507
He's not in.
Can you come along?

187
00:15:51,548 --> 00:15:52,632
Look.

188
00:15:52,882 --> 00:15:55,007
Broken, as usual.
Pain in the ass.

189
00:15:56,048 --> 00:15:58,965
How can we work in a clunker like this?

190
00:16:02,798 --> 00:16:05,757
Sometimes even the automatic locks
don't work.

191
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:09,007
They want more arrests
for their statistics

192
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:11,923
but the guys can open the doors and run.

193
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,465
It's wild.

194
00:16:17,673 --> 00:16:19,257
- Step back.
- What the fuck?

195
00:16:19,423 --> 00:16:20,423
Step back.

196
00:16:20,507 --> 00:16:22,048
Sonia, come on.

197
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:23,340
Sir, over there.

198
00:16:24,632 --> 00:16:26,215
- I can't talk to her?
- No.

199
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,215
Step back and stay put, you hear?

200
00:16:41,798 --> 00:16:43,965
He's not a bastard, you know.

201
00:16:45,548 --> 00:16:46,632
Excuse me?

202
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:51,507
He's not mean.
He didn't do it on purpose.

203
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,965
It's my fault too.

204
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,173
It'll be fine, ma'am.

205
00:17:05,173 --> 00:17:07,757
A man who hits a woman is no man.

206
00:17:08,048 --> 00:17:10,882
There's no justifying that, ever.

207
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:16,048
Let go! Let go, I said!

208
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:17,548
Stay here.

209
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,798
Calm down! You hear me?

210
00:17:25,965 --> 00:17:27,632
Yeah, I hear you.

211
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,132
What are you doing to him?

212
00:17:31,715 --> 00:17:33,090
Stop, you're hurting him.

213
00:17:33,257 --> 00:17:34,257
It'll be fine.

214
00:17:34,423 --> 00:17:35,715
You're hurting him.

215
00:17:39,923 --> 00:17:40,965
Leave.

216
00:17:43,215 --> 00:17:44,548
Please...

217
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,632
leave.

218
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:12,382
It's good.

219
00:18:13,257 --> 00:18:14,423
Take it away.

220
00:18:24,423 --> 00:18:26,465
I need a place like that.

221
00:18:26,632 --> 00:18:28,673
Change scenery, take a breather.

222
00:19:04,048 --> 00:19:07,507
<i>Everywhere in the streets
I want them to talk about me</i>

223
00:19:07,673 --> 00:19:11,423
<i>I want the girls to be naked
and to jump on me.</i>

224
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:15,173
<i>To admire me and to kill me.</i>

225
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,007
<i>To strip away my virtue.</i>

226
00:19:19,173 --> 00:19:22,965
<i>For the former schoolgirls
I'll be an idol.</i>

227
00:19:23,132 --> 00:19:26,798
<i>And every night,
out of breath in their beds</i>

228
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:30,507
<i>they'll cheat on their husbands.</i>

229
00:19:35,798 --> 00:19:37,715
I just wanted to punish him.

230
00:19:38,298 --> 00:19:39,798
I love my son!

231
00:19:40,298 --> 00:19:43,090
I wanted to teach him a lesson,
so he'd cool off.

232
00:19:43,465 --> 00:19:44,923
I'm not a bad mom.

233
00:19:45,465 --> 00:19:46,505
I didn't want to kill him.

234
00:20:00,715 --> 00:20:02,882
Despite the soap, it lingers.

235
00:20:03,548 --> 00:20:06,798
The smell of death.
Ever notice? It sticks.

236
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,923
When I go home,
I stay on the landing.

237
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:15,757
Till the light goes out.

238
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,507
I undress and count to 60.

239
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:22,090
So I don't take the shit inside.

240
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:24,382
I leave it in the hallway.

241
00:20:25,298 --> 00:20:26,590
It's stupid.

242
00:20:31,007 --> 00:20:32,590
For me, it's underwear.

243
00:20:35,465 --> 00:20:39,590
I always make sure
my underwear isn't too ugly.

244
00:20:40,715 --> 00:20:42,465
To be presentable, just in case.

245
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:45,382
If I end up on a slab at the morgue.

246
00:20:46,048 --> 00:20:47,632
It's stupid too.

247
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:02,007
<i>So Granny, what's this all about?</i>

248
00:21:03,673 --> 00:21:05,507
Trying to get attention?

249
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,048
Take care of yourself.

250
00:21:08,382 --> 00:21:09,382
Okay?

251
00:21:11,048 --> 00:21:13,548
And go easy on the nurses,
I know you.

252
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:16,340
I'm coming for Christmas.

253
00:21:17,632 --> 00:21:18,882
So wait for me.

254
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,882
You promise?

255
00:21:29,132 --> 00:21:30,132
There you go.

256
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:33,798
Love you.

257
00:22:16,298 --> 00:22:17,632
Something between you two?

258
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:19,007
Yeah, right.

259
00:22:26,215 --> 00:22:27,548
All good, Miss Norway?

260
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:30,923
What's wrong?

261
00:22:32,048 --> 00:22:33,340
Didn't get your bonus?

262
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:48,465
- Miss Norway...
- Aristide, stop calling me that.

263
00:22:48,965 --> 00:22:51,382
- Kebab or kebab?
- I can't. I have work.

264
00:22:52,215 --> 00:22:53,590
Cheating on me?

265
00:22:54,715 --> 00:22:56,340
Eating with another man?

266
00:22:59,882 --> 00:23:01,132
Okay, then.

267
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,840
Hello, chef!

268
00:23:09,965 --> 00:23:10,965
Hello.

269
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,507
Today I'm on a diet.

270
00:23:12,965 --> 00:23:16,298
Kebab, no meat, no bread.
Just lettuce and tomato.

271
00:23:16,465 --> 00:23:17,715
The usual?

272
00:23:17,882 --> 00:23:19,465
Just kidding. The usual.

273
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:21,257
Everything but onions.

274
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,298
No onions.

275
00:23:22,465 --> 00:23:24,632
- For here or to go?
- For here.

276
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:25,840
All right.

277
00:23:37,923 --> 00:23:39,465
I love my son.

278
00:23:39,632 --> 00:23:43,007
I wanted to teach him a lesson,
so he'd cool off.

279
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:44,840
I'm not a bad mom!

280
00:23:45,923 --> 00:23:48,965
- I didn't want to kill him...
- Shut up.

281
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:54,757
Stop now.

282
00:24:15,007 --> 00:24:16,923
<i>Backup requested by the riverbank.</i>

283
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,090
<i>What's wrong?</i>

284
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:20,798
<i>Nothing.</i>

285
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:26,382
Cool.

286
00:24:27,173 --> 00:24:28,923
Time to kick some ass.

287
00:24:32,215 --> 00:24:33,298
I mean it.

288
00:24:33,757 --> 00:24:35,632
Leave your ovaries at home.

289
00:24:36,132 --> 00:24:37,590
Lay off.

290
00:24:37,757 --> 00:24:40,007
Not today, and not you.

291
00:24:40,173 --> 00:24:41,465
Why "not me"?

292
00:24:42,215 --> 00:24:44,340
- What did I do?
- Nothing.

293
00:24:44,965 --> 00:24:46,632
So what is it?

294
00:24:47,298 --> 00:24:49,423
I'm getting an abortion.

295
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:52,507
I couldn't leave my ovaries at home.
Sorry.

296
00:24:55,215 --> 00:24:56,882
It's not your fault.

297
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,923
I forgot my pill.
One fucking time, here we are.

298
00:25:05,465 --> 00:25:07,048
You sure it's mine?

299
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:09,298
Yeah, I'm sure.

300
00:25:09,465 --> 00:25:11,798
I'll spare you the details.
100% sure.

301
00:25:37,298 --> 00:25:39,257
Why did you become a cop?

302
00:25:41,465 --> 00:25:44,048
Don't say you dreamt of it as a kid.

303
00:25:45,132 --> 00:25:46,757
I wanted to figure skate.

304
00:25:48,382 --> 00:25:49,465
Really?

305
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,507
How did you go from skates to guns?

306
00:25:53,632 --> 00:25:56,007
I don't know. It just happened.

307
00:25:56,715 --> 00:25:57,965
Let me guess.

308
00:25:58,298 --> 00:25:59,090
Dad a cop?

309
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:00,257
Nope.

310
00:26:00,757 --> 00:26:02,715
- Grandfather a cop?
- Not even.

311
00:26:03,715 --> 00:26:04,715
How about you?

312
00:26:05,757 --> 00:26:07,048
Well, me...

313
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:11,215
My choice was dealer or junkie.
Like my brothers.

314
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,715
What can I say?

315
00:26:15,298 --> 00:26:16,507
I went astray.

316
00:26:19,715 --> 00:26:21,007
You believed me?

317
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,673
It's not true?

318
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,173
- You believed me?
- Yeah.

319
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,340
Nope.

320
00:26:25,507 --> 00:26:27,257
Why not?
How would I know?

321
00:26:27,423 --> 00:26:29,632
- You're so prejudiced.
- Nonsense.

322
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:30,798
You are.

323
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,382
It could have been true.

324
00:26:35,215 --> 00:26:36,590
I have no brothers.

325
00:26:36,757 --> 00:26:37,757
All right.

326
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,215
Just a sister.

327
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,090
She's a judge.

328
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,840
Okay. Is that true?

329
00:26:43,215 --> 00:26:44,215
No.

330
00:26:44,257 --> 00:26:45,798
- It isn't?
- Nope.

331
00:26:47,298 --> 00:26:48,882
She's a speech therapist.

332
00:26:49,798 --> 00:26:50,923
Which is still cool.

333
00:26:54,882 --> 00:26:55,882
An ice skater.

334
00:26:58,423 --> 00:26:59,423
Yep.

335
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:01,298
I don't believe you.

336
00:28:04,257 --> 00:28:05,965
When is your curfew?

337
00:28:08,632 --> 00:28:09,632
Is your husband nice?

338
00:28:09,882 --> 00:28:11,090
Yeah, he is.

339
00:28:11,465 --> 00:28:12,632
He's cool.

340
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:13,798
And the kid?

341
00:28:14,715 --> 00:28:15,840
How old is he now?

342
00:28:17,298 --> 00:28:19,257
Young enough to count in months.

343
00:28:22,007 --> 00:28:23,257
How long you married?

344
00:28:23,715 --> 00:28:25,798
Is this an interrogation?

345
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:29,298
Can I keep my shoes and laces?

346
00:28:29,465 --> 00:28:31,132
I'm just interested.

347
00:28:31,923 --> 00:28:32,923
I'm not allowed?

348
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:36,632
Seven years.

349
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:38,923
Wow, not bad.

350
00:28:41,173 --> 00:28:43,965
I never went beyond seven days.

351
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,590
Bravo.

352
00:28:45,882 --> 00:28:47,215
That's the way I am.

353
00:28:47,923 --> 00:28:49,590
I can't be tamed.

354
00:28:51,548 --> 00:28:53,673
No one's trying to tame you.

355
00:28:54,173 --> 00:28:55,465
You mustn't worry.

356
00:28:55,923 --> 00:28:57,048
Really?

357
00:28:58,923 --> 00:29:00,007
Not even a little?

358
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:04,048
You're being an idiot.

359
00:29:07,382 --> 00:29:09,007
And I have to tell you.

360
00:29:09,173 --> 00:29:10,173
What?

361
00:29:11,757 --> 00:29:12,923
You skate well.

362
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,340
All right.

363
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,382
I have to go.

364
00:29:22,007 --> 00:29:23,090
Goodnight.

365
00:29:56,423 --> 00:29:59,173
I need two officers to volunteer.
It's urgent.

366
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:00,507
Aristide?

367
00:30:00,923 --> 00:30:02,132
No way.

368
00:30:02,465 --> 00:30:04,590
I have a life, unlike others.

369
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,673
Erik? Up for it?

370
00:30:09,048 --> 00:30:11,423
Yeah, but they have some nerve.

371
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,340
The fire isn't their fault.

372
00:30:14,507 --> 00:30:15,507
I'll do it.

373
00:30:15,882 --> 00:30:18,382
I have no plans.

374
00:30:20,423 --> 00:30:22,298
We'll meet you at the car.

375
00:30:24,382 --> 00:30:25,632
Still, I don't like it.

376
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:28,173
Escorting a prisoner isn't hard.

377
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,340
I don't like it.

378
00:30:29,507 --> 00:30:32,465
Neither do I.
I'd rather be with my wife.

379
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:34,132
Herve!

380
00:30:35,215 --> 00:30:37,132
I was kidding. I can go.

381
00:30:38,423 --> 00:30:39,757
No one's expecting me.

382
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,715
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

383
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,590
All right then.

384
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,340
Asomidin Tohirov?

385
00:31:05,132 --> 00:31:07,090
We're sending you to your country.

386
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:15,923
Understand?

387
00:31:37,007 --> 00:31:38,257
Sit down.

388
00:32:02,173 --> 00:32:03,382
Give that to me.

389
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,340
What is this?

390
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,590
You meant to swallow it?

391
00:32:53,507 --> 00:32:55,132
What are you doing here?

392
00:33:15,632 --> 00:33:16,632
So?

393
00:33:17,048 --> 00:33:19,423
Ready to kick out a foreigner?

394
00:33:20,548 --> 00:33:22,048
Why do you say that?

395
00:33:22,423 --> 00:33:24,173
It's what we're doing.

396
00:33:25,673 --> 00:33:26,923
You hadn't understood?

397
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:29,173
Erik, is this true?

398
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,257
Yes, because of the fire.

399
00:33:31,673 --> 00:33:34,673
A guy needs to be at the airport.
We're driving him.

400
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,423
It's not our job.
Why do we have to?

401
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:40,215
Not our job? Why did you offer?

402
00:33:40,507 --> 00:33:41,882
You're funny.

403
00:33:42,048 --> 00:33:46,298
I told you, Escort Crew is busy
transporting detainees.

404
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:48,090
I didn't know.

405
00:33:48,632 --> 00:33:49,798
You volunteered.

406
00:33:49,965 --> 00:33:51,298
I couldn't guess.

407
00:33:52,632 --> 00:33:55,048
You just didn't want to go home.

408
00:34:12,507 --> 00:34:14,590
Where's an all-night drugstore?

409
00:34:15,423 --> 00:34:17,132
What's wrong now?

410
00:34:17,673 --> 00:34:20,423
I need to make a quick stop.
Can we?

411
00:34:21,215 --> 00:34:22,590
Can't wait till tomorrow?

412
00:34:22,757 --> 00:34:25,090
No. I needed to go after my shift.

413
00:34:25,423 --> 00:34:27,840
I don't know where there is one.

414
00:34:28,757 --> 00:34:30,340
There's one at Nation.

415
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:35,715
We have time to make a detour.
Quickly.

416
00:35:09,673 --> 00:35:10,673
Anything else?

417
00:35:11,465 --> 00:35:12,923
A glass of water.

418
00:35:16,632 --> 00:35:18,965
Prefab units are fire hazards.

419
00:35:19,257 --> 00:35:21,548
They cram them in
and they're surprised.

420
00:38:13,132 --> 00:38:14,965
<i>That's the way it is.</i>

421
00:38:17,715 --> 00:38:20,840
<i>So damn pretty,
when she goes out.</i>

422
00:38:23,715 --> 00:38:27,048
<i>So damn pretty,
I love her so damn much.</i>

423
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:32,590
<i>She has eyes like a gun.</i>

424
00:38:32,965 --> 00:38:35,673
<i>She has a killer gaze.</i>

425
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,548
<i>She's pulled the trigger first.</i>

426
00:38:38,715 --> 00:38:40,715
<i>She hit me, I'm dying...</i>

427
00:38:50,465 --> 00:38:52,590
You're such a cock-block.

428
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:57,298
You two are so depressing.

429
00:38:57,715 --> 00:38:59,798
It's like being in a hearse.

430
00:39:06,965 --> 00:39:09,257
I won a song contest as a kid.

431
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:14,132
I had a voice, I swear...
clear as crystal.

432
00:39:14,465 --> 00:39:16,007
Angelic.

433
00:39:16,173 --> 00:39:19,548
My grandma thought I'd be
the next Michael Jackson.

434
00:39:21,257 --> 00:39:23,465
But no... my voice changed.

435
00:39:24,632 --> 00:39:26,548
Who cares about your life?

436
00:39:27,257 --> 00:39:28,673
We don't give a shit.

437
00:39:29,173 --> 00:39:31,132
You're pissing us off.

438
00:40:00,757 --> 00:40:01,882
The reception office?

439
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,465
Down on the left.

440
00:40:58,132 --> 00:41:01,590
I'm here to take the detainee
to the airport.

441
00:41:02,632 --> 00:41:04,007
Follow me.

442
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:06,715
How did the fire start?

443
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:08,382
With a mattress.

444
00:41:08,673 --> 00:41:11,465
They have lots of imagination.
Lots.

445
00:41:12,507 --> 00:41:16,632
Some slice open their bellies,
others start fires.

446
00:41:17,382 --> 00:41:18,965
Each one has his thing.

447
00:41:20,757 --> 00:41:22,173
We have nothing here.

448
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,923
No equipment.

449
00:41:24,423 --> 00:41:26,382
Not even an emergency exit.

450
00:41:26,757 --> 00:41:28,340
We had to cut the bars

451
00:41:28,507 --> 00:41:30,423
or they'd all have sizzled.

452
00:41:41,882 --> 00:41:43,840
Guy in the orange sweater.

453
00:41:44,007 --> 00:41:45,257
A Tadjik.

454
00:41:46,048 --> 00:41:47,798
He has his belongings.

455
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:50,507
- Was he frisked?
- He's clean.

456
00:41:50,673 --> 00:41:53,632
He had a blade on him, so watch out.

457
00:43:13,298 --> 00:43:16,215
For the Deportation Unit at Roissy.

458
00:43:19,257 --> 00:43:20,882
Know where you're going?

459
00:43:22,382 --> 00:43:23,715
Understands nothing.

460
00:43:24,298 --> 00:43:26,382
We're taking you to the airport.

461
00:43:27,382 --> 00:43:31,173
You have a layover in Istanbul.
Then back to Tajikistan.

462
00:43:32,173 --> 00:43:33,548
Any objections?

463
00:43:34,882 --> 00:43:35,882
No?

464
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:39,798
I'll handcuff you for the ride.

465
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:38,382
Tohirov?

466
00:44:39,007 --> 00:44:41,298
You're not going to the airport?

467
00:44:41,757 --> 00:44:44,882
We appealed to the European Court
for Human Rights.

468
00:44:45,048 --> 00:44:46,298
They're ruling soon.

469
00:44:46,465 --> 00:44:47,632
I know nothing about it.

470
00:44:47,798 --> 00:44:49,757
They'll kill him back home.

471
00:44:49,923 --> 00:44:51,007
It's not my call.

472
00:44:51,173 --> 00:44:53,423
You may as well let him burn.

473
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:54,840
Less hypocritical!

474
00:44:55,757 --> 00:44:57,673
Noble profession! Bravo!

475
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:02,340
So?

476
00:45:02,632 --> 00:45:03,757
It's all good.

477
00:45:04,132 --> 00:45:05,340
I was looking for you.

478
00:45:05,507 --> 00:45:06,507
I'm here.

479
00:45:29,548 --> 00:45:31,673
We saved you from the flames.

480
00:45:33,173 --> 00:45:35,382
- Say thanks.
- No French.

481
00:45:35,548 --> 00:45:37,590
TN12, individual in custody.

482
00:45:37,757 --> 00:45:38,757
<i>Copy that.</i>

483
00:46:04,715 --> 00:46:06,007
He's not too calm?

484
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:09,048
Keep an eye on him...

485
00:46:11,632 --> 00:46:12,757
Yeah.

486
00:47:29,715 --> 00:47:30,715
Erik...

487
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,965
Why did you open it?

488
00:47:36,673 --> 00:47:38,548
What are you, a cop?

489
00:47:38,715 --> 00:47:40,007
Is your name on it?

490
00:47:40,173 --> 00:47:41,757
No? So don't open.

491
00:47:41,923 --> 00:47:43,548
It was half open.

492
00:47:43,923 --> 00:47:44,965
Mail theft.

493
00:47:57,548 --> 00:47:59,215
Something political?

494
00:47:59,923 --> 00:48:01,382
I don't know...

495
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:05,840
Understand what you read?

496
00:48:08,132 --> 00:48:10,048
- Did you understand?
- Yes.

497
00:48:11,465 --> 00:48:12,715
And so?

498
00:48:13,007 --> 00:48:14,132
Just words.

499
00:48:14,298 --> 00:48:16,632
Excuse me.
"Men in masks led me"

500
00:48:17,382 --> 00:48:19,215
to an isolation cell,

501
00:48:19,382 --> 00:48:21,673
a dungeon.
I was tortured for days.

502
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:25,132
Very violent.
Groups of 3 or 4, at all hours.

503
00:48:25,298 --> 00:48:28,923
They beat me nonstop.
Fists, feet, clubs.

504
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:32,132
A torturer asked if I wanted a smoke.

505
00:48:32,465 --> 00:48:33,465
I said yes.

506
00:48:33,507 --> 00:48:34,757
He lit a cigarette

507
00:48:34,923 --> 00:48:37,882
and put a gas mask on me,
so I'd suffocate.

508
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:43,757
Then they put wires around my wrists

509
00:48:44,173 --> 00:48:46,632
and electrocuted me.
I fainted.

510
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:49,840
"It lasted ten days.
I thought I'd die."

511
00:48:51,548 --> 00:48:53,132
Just words?

512
00:48:53,298 --> 00:48:55,923
A story like that costs 15 euros.

513
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:59,507
There are tons of details.
He can't have invented it.

514
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,632
What do you want us to do?

515
00:49:04,673 --> 00:49:07,423
Envelopes are sealed for a reason.

516
00:49:13,007 --> 00:49:14,632
They're going to kill him.

517
00:49:14,798 --> 00:49:16,215
A real sob story.

518
00:49:16,382 --> 00:49:17,382
Yeah.

519
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:21,673
They exaggerate the threat
to get refugee status.

520
00:49:22,923 --> 00:49:25,007
They lie. Embroider.

521
00:49:25,715 --> 00:49:27,507
Why issue an order to deport

522
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:30,298
if he'd be killed upon arrival?

523
00:49:30,465 --> 00:49:31,757
Think it over.

524
00:49:38,965 --> 00:49:41,632
Enough.
We're not here to chitchat.

525
00:49:41,798 --> 00:49:43,840
We're cops, not social workers.

526
00:49:44,007 --> 00:49:46,048
You never loosen up.

527
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:33,923
What the hell?

528
00:51:35,173 --> 00:51:36,465
It's okay. He's fine.

529
00:51:37,007 --> 00:51:39,007
What's got into you?
Cuff him.

530
00:51:41,423 --> 00:51:42,423
Go on, breathe.

531
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:45,298
What's your problem today?

532
00:51:46,048 --> 00:51:48,590
Is he a friend of yours?
Got family in Tajikistan?

533
00:51:49,923 --> 00:51:52,298
He's a shrimp.
Why are you scared?

534
00:51:52,465 --> 00:51:54,840
You're a pain! A real pain!

535
00:51:55,715 --> 00:51:56,715
Isn't she?

536
00:51:57,548 --> 00:51:59,132
Yes. She's a pain.

537
00:52:09,257 --> 00:52:11,132
<i>I'm working, dammit!!!</i>

538
00:53:48,548 --> 00:53:50,382
Why not the flashing lights?

539
00:54:00,382 --> 00:54:03,590
Yeah, run red lights,
take roundabouts counter-clockwise.

540
00:54:03,757 --> 00:54:05,382
Want the engine on our laps?

541
00:54:05,715 --> 00:54:08,173
I said we have time.
What's your problem?

542
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,965
<i>Your mother?</i>

543
00:54:23,215 --> 00:54:24,382
<i>No, my grandmother.</i>

544
00:54:24,882 --> 00:54:26,465
She raised me.

545
00:54:26,632 --> 00:54:28,257
One hell of a woman.

546
00:54:28,423 --> 00:54:29,840
What about your parents?

547
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:31,465
What about them?

548
00:54:32,215 --> 00:54:33,840
What did they do?

549
00:54:34,507 --> 00:54:35,882
Where are they from?

550
00:54:39,257 --> 00:54:41,132
Do I ask you questions?

551
00:54:42,465 --> 00:54:43,882
I can't know?

552
00:54:45,465 --> 00:54:47,090
They were in France.

553
00:54:47,548 --> 00:54:49,132
I came afterwards.

554
00:54:49,298 --> 00:54:50,923
How old were you?

555
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:03,090
Do we have to share our lives?

556
00:55:05,132 --> 00:55:06,132
Yes?

557
00:55:06,465 --> 00:55:07,465
No.

558
00:55:11,548 --> 00:55:14,048
We'll have to stop meeting up.

559
00:55:14,965 --> 00:55:16,090
I know.

560
00:55:16,257 --> 00:55:18,882
I don't know, like this anyway...

561
00:55:19,798 --> 00:55:21,965
- I'm trying, I swear.
- Okay.

562
00:55:23,257 --> 00:55:24,590
Trying very hard.

563
00:55:24,757 --> 00:55:26,048
I keep saying it.

564
00:55:26,215 --> 00:55:28,382
I'm also trying hard.

565
00:55:28,923 --> 00:55:30,590
I keep saying to myself:

566
00:55:30,965 --> 00:55:33,548
"Miss Norway isn't for you."

567
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:35,507
She's not for you.

568
00:55:37,548 --> 00:55:38,882
"She's married."

569
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:43,757
So I try to imagine you old, wrinkled.

570
00:55:44,173 --> 00:55:46,215
Ugly as sin, no teeth.

571
00:55:46,673 --> 00:55:49,173
So you'll disgust me forever.

572
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:51,798
So I can move on.
But then you laugh...

573
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:53,548
What can I do?

574
00:55:54,632 --> 00:55:57,090
My heart melts like snow in the sun.

575
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:00,965
A poet. You kept that hidden.

576
00:56:01,715 --> 00:56:03,798
What do I do now?

577
00:56:03,965 --> 00:56:04,965
Figure it out.

578
00:56:05,048 --> 00:56:06,882
It's a lost cause.

579
00:56:13,798 --> 00:56:15,132
Why are you exiting?

580
00:56:16,090 --> 00:56:17,382
I'm hungry.

581
00:56:34,215 --> 00:56:35,340
Coming?

582
00:56:37,548 --> 00:56:38,882
Hurry up.

583
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:10,923
Keep it up
and Erik's going to lose it.

584
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:13,340
What are you after?

585
00:57:14,715 --> 00:57:16,423
Any chance the Tajik can run?

586
00:57:17,298 --> 00:57:18,298
No.

587
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:26,465
Would you let him run?

588
00:57:26,965 --> 00:57:28,507
I have no idea.

589
00:57:29,423 --> 00:57:31,132
I don't care about him.

590
00:57:31,923 --> 00:57:35,090
Think Mr. Clean would let you do it?

591
00:57:36,132 --> 00:57:37,173
But you...

592
00:57:38,757 --> 00:57:40,298
would you let him run?

593
00:57:41,382 --> 00:57:42,673
You're talking crap.

594
00:57:46,382 --> 00:57:48,340
They're playing me for a fool.

595
00:57:49,548 --> 00:57:51,423
Don't try anything stupid.

596
00:57:53,423 --> 00:57:54,965
I have my eyes on you.

597
00:57:58,882 --> 00:58:00,423
I'm no fool.

598
00:58:02,423 --> 00:58:04,132
You play the victim,

599
00:58:04,298 --> 00:58:06,965
but maybe you came
to blow up a market.

600
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:09,965
Who knows if you're an innocent lamb?

601
00:58:11,215 --> 00:58:14,048
Refugee or terrorist, how can we tell?

602
00:58:15,632 --> 00:58:17,173
No one is innocent

603
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:19,048
until proof of the contrary.

604
00:58:44,923 --> 00:58:48,215
3-course meal?
They're fucking in the crapper!

605
00:58:55,132 --> 00:58:56,798
I don't understand what you said.

606
00:58:58,298 --> 00:58:59,673
I don't understand.

607
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:02,673
I understand nothing.

608
00:59:21,048 --> 00:59:23,548
You're even prettier when you frown.

609
00:59:26,215 --> 00:59:27,257
You're stupid.

610
00:59:27,423 --> 00:59:28,757
I wish.

611
00:59:29,048 --> 00:59:30,215
Wish what?

612
00:59:30,382 --> 00:59:31,673
That I was stupid.

613
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,798
What you told me earlier...

614
00:59:41,632 --> 00:59:43,382
about what you're doing...

615
00:59:47,215 --> 00:59:48,882
I keep thinking about it.

616
00:59:52,882 --> 00:59:54,215
It kills me.

617
00:59:57,007 --> 00:59:59,090
I can't get it out of my head.

618
01:00:05,173 --> 01:00:06,590
When are you going?

619
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:08,632
Tomorrow morning.

620
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,715
Is anyone accompanying you?

621
01:00:13,132 --> 01:00:14,132
Yes.

622
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,798
I'm going with a friend.

623
01:00:16,965 --> 01:00:18,090
Good.

624
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:23,215
- Just don't go alone.
- Don't worry.

625
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:25,923
Corinne is coming along.

626
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:30,465
Corinne?

627
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:38,923
You better watch your guy.
He can up and go.

628
01:00:40,673 --> 01:00:41,757
No, no.

629
01:00:42,465 --> 01:00:45,382
He's not hungry.
He'll eat in the plane.

630
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:47,090
Come on.

631
01:01:05,882 --> 01:01:07,382
What are you doing?

632
01:01:12,048 --> 01:01:13,757
Think I don't understand?

633
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:18,465
You open the file, uncuff him,

634
01:01:18,632 --> 01:01:21,798
stop for burgers,
stop at every light.

635
01:01:23,257 --> 01:01:26,882
We're asked to take him to Roissy,
we take him to Roissy.

636
01:01:27,757 --> 01:01:30,298
Police, airport, airplane.
Understand?

637
01:01:34,548 --> 01:01:38,382
At least Escort Crew is competent.
Imagine the clusterfuck!

638
01:01:38,715 --> 01:01:41,382
- Someone shit on your brains?
- Enough!

639
01:01:42,132 --> 01:01:44,215
Stop bossing us around.

640
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:47,548
What do you think?

641
01:01:48,257 --> 01:01:50,590
That your platitudes impress us?

642
01:02:01,465 --> 01:02:03,465
You'll make me gain weight.

643
01:02:06,798 --> 01:02:08,173
Find that funny?

644
01:03:34,757 --> 01:03:36,507
Pain in the fucking ass!

645
01:03:36,673 --> 01:03:37,840
Pull over!

646
01:03:38,465 --> 01:03:39,882
What do I do?

647
01:03:40,298 --> 01:03:41,340
Take the exit.

648
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:44,965
And he's not cuffed, dammit!

649
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:04,382
Get up front.

650
01:04:27,048 --> 01:04:28,548
I take the highway?

651
01:04:31,465 --> 01:04:33,173
Yes or no?

652
01:04:37,632 --> 01:04:38,757
So?

653
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:41,465
Of course. Take the highway.

654
01:04:42,798 --> 01:04:44,382
What else?

655
01:04:45,132 --> 01:04:47,340
Open the door and let him run?

656
01:04:47,965 --> 01:04:49,923
You think it's that easy?

657
01:04:50,507 --> 01:04:51,548
Think so?

658
01:04:51,715 --> 01:04:54,965
Sure, it's romantic,
but you think it's easy.

659
01:04:56,798 --> 01:04:59,173
They wouldn't send a chopper.

660
01:04:59,507 --> 01:05:01,215
He's not a fugitive.

661
01:05:01,632 --> 01:05:03,048
Yeah, he's nothing.

662
01:05:03,548 --> 01:05:04,923
No one cares about him.

663
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:08,923
If he vanished,
no one would go looking.

664
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:13,507
He's just a poor guy, not a criminal.

665
01:05:14,923 --> 01:05:15,923
What do you know?

666
01:05:16,298 --> 01:05:17,840
I know, that's all.

667
01:05:36,007 --> 01:05:37,673
And your panic attacks?

668
01:05:38,507 --> 01:05:39,632
Fine.

669
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:43,132
Still a tranquilizer a day?

670
01:05:43,965 --> 01:05:45,715
I'm down to a quarter.

671
01:05:45,882 --> 01:05:49,048
If it's not enough,
three quarters, or four.

672
01:05:52,007 --> 01:05:53,673
Meaning a whole pill.

673
01:05:58,507 --> 01:06:00,173
Sometimes it comes back.

674
01:06:01,923 --> 01:06:03,382
Especially at night.

675
01:06:05,382 --> 01:06:07,548
I tell myself
his death wasn't my fault.

676
01:06:09,798 --> 01:06:12,673
I couldn't know
the guy had a box-cutter.

677
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:19,382
Bad luck, that's all.

678
01:06:20,923 --> 01:06:22,173
Bad luck?

679
01:06:22,632 --> 01:06:24,340
Is that what you really think?

680
01:06:25,757 --> 01:06:27,382
I don't think.

681
01:06:28,132 --> 01:06:30,548
I think nothing.
I clear out my head.

682
01:06:35,715 --> 01:06:37,673
It's like there's a desert inside.

683
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:41,382
I listen to the wind blow.

684
01:06:42,673 --> 01:06:43,923
And I move forward.

685
01:06:45,173 --> 01:06:46,173
That's all.

686
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:50,757
I move forward.

687
01:06:53,715 --> 01:06:54,882
Look at him.

688
01:06:57,590 --> 01:06:58,840
Look.

689
01:07:00,590 --> 01:07:02,673
Still waters run deep.

690
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:05,048
Stop with your dumb proverbs.

691
01:07:05,215 --> 01:07:06,382
Look at him.

692
01:07:20,632 --> 01:07:22,840
You two are out of your minds!

693
01:07:23,507 --> 01:07:26,465
We'd be in deep shit
if we let him run.

694
01:07:26,632 --> 01:07:27,923
You have no idea!

695
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:35,673
You're okay
sending him to die?

696
01:07:36,923 --> 01:07:38,673
I'm the bastard, is that it?

697
01:07:39,007 --> 01:07:41,757
You're humanists.
I'm a dumb, obedient cop.

698
01:07:41,923 --> 01:07:44,715
Yes, I follow orders. It's my job.

699
01:07:45,298 --> 01:07:47,173
It's yours too. Dammit!

700
01:07:53,507 --> 01:07:55,923
You're all pissing me off!

701
01:07:56,673 --> 01:07:58,048
Yes, what now?

702
01:08:02,257 --> 01:08:04,007
Martine, I'm working.

703
01:08:04,382 --> 01:08:06,507
Understand? Working!

704
01:08:07,465 --> 01:08:11,090
Unlike you, on my ass
popping pills and watching TV.

705
01:08:11,257 --> 01:08:13,965
We'll deal with this later.
Okay? Later.

706
01:08:23,548 --> 01:08:25,215
Pain in the fucking ass!

707
01:08:26,715 --> 01:08:29,632
TN12, it's cutting out.
No-signal zone.

708
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:33,048
You have 6 minutes.

709
01:08:33,215 --> 01:08:35,507
Do as you please.
I wash my hands of it.

710
01:09:18,548 --> 01:09:20,340
You played your game well.

711
01:09:22,632 --> 01:09:23,632
Fuck...

712
01:09:24,673 --> 01:09:26,132
Unbelievable.

713
01:09:27,798 --> 01:09:29,590
It's a topsy-turvy world.

714
01:09:58,340 --> 01:09:59,507
What?

715
01:10:02,007 --> 01:10:03,632
Got a problem with that?

716
01:10:05,465 --> 01:10:06,882
Go on, say so.

717
01:10:08,798 --> 01:10:10,632
Got a problem with alcohol?

718
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,340
Only remedy that works.

719
01:11:08,257 --> 01:11:11,048
Martine, where are you?
Why won't you answer?

720
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:13,423
Now I'm worried.

721
01:11:13,882 --> 01:11:16,048
Bravo, you won, call me back.

722
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:46,257
If I ever had to shoot myself,

723
01:12:47,048 --> 01:12:48,132
I'd come here.

724
01:13:04,173 --> 01:13:06,298
What the fuck is he doing?

725
01:13:11,132 --> 01:13:12,882
Enough already, get lost!

726
01:13:13,423 --> 01:13:15,048
Go, we'll keep quiet.

727
01:13:15,298 --> 01:13:16,590
We'll keep quiet!

728
01:13:17,465 --> 01:13:18,465
Wait...

729
01:13:18,590 --> 01:13:20,298
Here, take this.

730
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:22,132
Go on, run.

731
01:13:22,382 --> 01:13:23,798
Move it, move it!

732
01:13:24,465 --> 01:13:25,465
Beat it!

733
01:13:25,507 --> 01:13:26,590
Go on, go on!

734
01:13:26,757 --> 01:13:28,382
I don't believe this!

735
01:13:46,132 --> 01:13:47,215
Forget it.

736
01:13:47,382 --> 01:13:48,215
Why?

737
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:50,673
He thinks we want to kill him.

738
01:13:56,923 --> 01:13:57,965
Wait.

739
01:14:01,423 --> 01:14:03,632
Now the airport. Get in.

740
01:14:03,798 --> 01:14:05,090
What's got into you?

741
01:14:05,257 --> 01:14:08,215
Stick your consciences up your asses.
Get in.

742
01:14:08,715 --> 01:14:10,673
- We almost...
- That's enough!

743
01:14:11,423 --> 01:14:12,590
You're fucking pains!

744
01:14:15,090 --> 01:14:16,798
I can't take it anymore.

745
01:14:17,423 --> 01:14:18,548
Enough!

746
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:24,632
He won't run an inch.

747
01:14:24,798 --> 01:14:26,923
Stop bothering him and get in.

748
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:29,257
Good dog.

749
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:32,423
A good little retriever. Great.

750
01:14:36,090 --> 01:14:37,090
Get in.

751
01:14:37,798 --> 01:14:40,090
Stop showing off.
Let's finish the job.

752
01:14:40,507 --> 01:14:42,548
You got no balls, do you?

753
01:14:43,548 --> 01:14:45,132
Not yours, in any case.

754
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:50,673
Get in.

755
01:14:51,548 --> 01:14:54,007
What if I refuse?
What then?

756
01:14:54,882 --> 01:14:56,048
You'll call the cops?

757
01:14:56,215 --> 01:14:57,423
That's enough.

758
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:00,798
Everyone, get in. Let's go.

759
01:15:04,590 --> 01:15:05,673
Get in!

760
01:18:30,048 --> 01:18:31,715
The file, please.

761
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:35,215
Hey. What's he like?

762
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:36,798
Cooperative.

763
01:18:37,590 --> 01:18:38,965
This way, sir.

764
01:18:39,132 --> 01:18:40,298
Come.

765
01:18:40,632 --> 01:18:42,923
Go inside. We'll search you.

766
01:18:46,423 --> 01:18:50,048
You leave today. Understand?
You take the plane.

767
01:18:51,215 --> 01:18:52,507
We'll search you.

768
01:18:54,423 --> 01:18:55,840
Can we go now?

769
01:18:56,382 --> 01:18:58,423
You must wait till takeoff.

770
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:01,715
Are you kidding? Wait an hour?

771
01:19:02,548 --> 01:19:04,215
Yes, and I'm being nice.

772
01:19:04,382 --> 01:19:06,382
Rule is you wait 2 hours,

773
01:19:06,548 --> 01:19:08,882
till the point of no-return.

774
01:19:22,507 --> 01:19:24,257
Are you hazing us?

775
01:19:25,090 --> 01:19:26,798
Because we're not Escort Crew?

776
01:19:27,673 --> 01:19:30,632
Not at all, it's just procedure.

777
01:22:04,673 --> 01:22:06,007
- You okay?
- No...

778
01:22:06,798 --> 01:22:09,215
I don't feel well. Can we stop?

779
01:23:10,757 --> 01:23:12,465
Virginie, what are you doing?

780
01:24:22,882 --> 01:24:25,007
We're in charge of security.

781
01:24:25,590 --> 01:24:26,798
It's under control.

782
01:24:26,965 --> 01:24:28,632
He was agitated, but...

783
01:24:28,798 --> 01:24:30,465
Why the Velcro cuffs?

784
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:33,090
They never come off. Procedure.

785
01:24:33,507 --> 01:24:34,798
- He's calm.
- He's dangerous.

786
01:24:34,965 --> 01:24:36,632
Don't fall for his victim act.

787
01:24:57,090 --> 01:24:59,090
...he's capable of anything...

788
01:25:05,882 --> 01:25:07,965
...want to take that risk?

789
01:25:11,215 --> 01:25:12,798
We'll remove him.

790
01:26:02,257 --> 01:26:03,757
Watch out for mosquitos.

791
01:26:04,548 --> 01:26:06,007
They carry malaria here.

792
01:26:10,507 --> 01:26:11,923
There are rabbits.

793
01:26:14,465 --> 01:26:16,590
I'm so damn stupid.

794
01:26:19,132 --> 01:26:22,882
Talking about rabbits,
not the stuff I want to say.

795
01:26:27,632 --> 01:26:29,048
Like what?

796
01:26:35,382 --> 01:26:36,965
Even if you're crazy,

797
01:26:39,257 --> 01:26:41,215
life is less boring with you.

798
01:27:04,298 --> 01:27:08,465
Remember the schizo who killed his son,
then himself.

799
01:27:08,965 --> 01:27:10,007
Yeah.

800
01:27:10,382 --> 01:27:12,257
Remember the mom's cries?

801
01:27:14,007 --> 01:27:15,923
I still remember the address.

802
01:27:16,215 --> 01:27:17,465
The floor.

803
01:27:17,632 --> 01:27:19,257
I remember the door code.

804
01:27:19,423 --> 01:27:21,257
Want me to tell you?

805
01:27:24,632 --> 01:27:26,590
I'm no retriever dog.

806
01:27:49,090 --> 01:27:51,632
Thanks for calming down
the Customs agents.

807
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:56,007
Don't exaggerate.

808
01:27:56,548 --> 01:27:59,673
I did damage control.
They'll report us.

809
01:28:01,215 --> 01:28:02,798
A fucking report.

810
01:28:06,215 --> 01:28:08,673
20 years of service, not one blemish

811
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:11,007
and you stir up the shit.

812
01:28:11,507 --> 01:28:13,132
I feel dirty.

813
01:28:13,965 --> 01:28:16,173
I lied to cover your asses.

814
01:28:17,173 --> 01:28:18,715
What got into you two?

815
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:20,632
Jesus...

816
01:28:21,590 --> 01:28:23,048
What got into you?

817
01:28:23,423 --> 01:28:25,673
What did you buy him, 2 days?

818
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:28,465
You don't think
he'll be on the next plane?

819
01:28:28,798 --> 01:28:30,048
You never know.

820
01:28:31,298 --> 01:28:34,673
- If the European Court rules...
- Yeah, right.

821
01:28:37,215 --> 01:28:38,840
Keep lying to yourself.

822
01:29:19,423 --> 01:29:20,923
Not going home, chief?

823
01:29:21,257 --> 01:29:23,798
No, as you can see, I'm not.

824
01:29:30,132 --> 01:29:31,382
See you tomorrow.

825
01:29:31,798 --> 01:29:32,840
Yep.

826
01:29:51,965 --> 01:29:55,340
<i>No use coming home.
I changed the lock.</i>

827
01:30:32,590 --> 01:30:35,965
47, 48, 49...

828
01:30:51,507 --> 01:30:52,840
60.

829
01:32:12,965 --> 01:32:15,882
I'll keep my clothes.
You don't mind?

830
01:32:20,632 --> 01:32:23,340
Just your hands on my arms, my back...

831
01:32:27,173 --> 01:32:28,507
Gently.

832
01:32:34,798 --> 01:32:38,215
Just my back and arms.
Don't bother on my skin.

833
