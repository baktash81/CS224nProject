Great, Mr. Hatfield. I'll let her know and
get back in touch soon.

177
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:46,729
Thanks.

178
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,108
Oh...

179
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,371
I mean,
I was 19 years old.

180
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,874
It was, like, just so long ago.
I totally forgot about it.

181
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,001
I never thought
they'd ever use my stuff.

182
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,127
TANYA: Why not?

183
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,337
Well, I'd use it.

184
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,629
Oh, baby.

185
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,049
It's weird.

186
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:20,721
There's a kid out there.
I mean, I'm kind of curious, I think.

187
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,598
Yeah?
Yeah.

188
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,683
So what are you gonna do?

189
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:25,934
I don't know.
What would you do?

190
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:27,728
I don't know.

191
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:28,896
You got to figure it out.

192
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,731
Yeah, no doubt.

193
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,818
All right, I got to go now.
All right.

194
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,529
Thanks for coming.
It was really nice.

195
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,492
I'll see you tomorrow.

196
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,118
So, drive safe.

197
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,882
JULES: M-E-R. "Zoomer. "

198
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,050
JONI: No way.

199
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,134
That is so not a word.

200
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,302
No, it totally is.

201
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,804
That's not a word.
If you're gonna zoom somewhere,

202
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,430
then you're a zoomer.
A person who zooms.

203
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,515
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

204
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,724
So that would be...
Let's see, that's 31...

205
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:06,892
Hello?

206
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,977
PAUL: Hi.
I'm looking for Joni Allgood.

207
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,646
Yeah, this is she.

208
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,565
Hey.

209
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,860
(STUTTERING)
This is Paul, your donor.

210
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,237
Eleven points
for Mommy.

211
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:19,822
Oh! H i.

212
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,450
Hey. Don't be a zoomer.

213
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:24,576
PAUL: Hey.

214
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:25,702
Come back.

215
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,246
Is this a good time to talk?

216
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,206
Yeah. No,
this is great.

217
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,544
So, how are you?
How are you?

218
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,170
I'm good.
How are you?

219
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,547
I'm well, thanks.

220
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:40,467
Wendy at the Cryobank

221
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,929
was talking about maybe...

222
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,222
JONI: Oh, yeah. Well.

223
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,641
Actually, my brother
asked if I'd call you,

224
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,352
because I'm 18,
and he's only 15, which is,

225
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,396
you know, which is
too young to call.

226
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,898
Anyway, he'd like
to meet you.

227
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,191
You know,
if you want to.

228
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,402
Your brother?

229
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,572
Yeah. Well, technically
he's my half-brother.

230
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:04,950
Each of my moms had a kid,
you know, with...

231
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,577
With your...
With your sperm.

232
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,620
Like in both of them?

233
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:09,872
Yeah.

234
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,290
Like in two?

235
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:12,875
U h-huh. Like in gay.

236
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,420
Oh! Right. Right.
Right on.

237
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,131
Right on.
Yeah, cool. I...

238
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,799
I love lesbians.

239
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,471
Great.
So you wanna,

240
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:29,600
I don't know, get a bite to eat or
something? You and your brother?

241
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,611
I just don't want you
to have big expectations.

242
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,988
Will you quit saying that?
I have no expectations, all right?

243
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,617
Okay. I'm just saying.
He might be weird.

244
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:50,496
I mean, he donated sperm.
That's weird.

245
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,416
Well, you know, if he hadn't, we wouldn't
be here, so respect.

246
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,598
Hello?

247
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,434
Hey. Hey.

248
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,187
You're Joni, right?
H i, I'm Joni.

249
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,939
I'm Paul. N ice to meet you.
N ice to meet you.

250
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,690
You must be Laser?
Laser, yeah.

251
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,442
Right on.
That's a very cool name.

252
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:21,693
Thanks.

253
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,028
Well...

254
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:24,863
Cool.

255
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:27,866
Yeah. Yeah.

256
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:31,954
Listen, you know, feel free
to ask me anything, anything you want.

257
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,123
Cool, thanks. Yeah.
Cool.

258
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:43,507
Laser, do you have
any questions that you wanna ask?

259
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,675
Go ahead, shoot.
Anything.

260
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:49,263
I didn't really have any, you know,
specific questions or anything, so...

261
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,389
Nothing?

262
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:52,558
Not really.

263
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,018
Well, I mean, I'd love to know more
about you guys.

264
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,895
Everything. I mean...

265
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,815
So what do you do, Joni?
What are you into?

266
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:05,362
I just graduated high school, and I'm
starting college in the fall, so...

267
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,905
Hey, that's great.
Congratulations.

268
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,073
Thanks.

269
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,075
LASER: Yeah,
Joni's the brains in the family.

270
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,953
She's got the National
Merit Scholarship for science.

271
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,371
Shut the front door.

272
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,747
Okay, Laser, thanks.

273
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,499
Wow.
LASER: I'm just telling him you're smart.

274
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,918
No, I just work
harder than you.

275
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,006
Hey, Laze, seriously,
don't sweat school, man.

276
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:29,386
I mean, I didn't do well in school either,
and I'm not doing so badly now, right?

277
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,848
It's Laser. Yeah.

278
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:37,060
Sorry. Laser. Right.

279
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,437
LASER: It's cool.

280
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,023
So, what are you
into, Laser?

281
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,734
Laser's an amazing athlete.

282
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,527
Really? Yeah?

283
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,071
Did you ever play
any sports in school or...

284
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:50,782
PAUL: I did a little
B- ball in junior high.

285
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,243
That's cool.
Was that it or...

286
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:56,288
Well, the whole "team" thing just got
on my nerves after a while, you know?

287
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:59,833
It was like, "Hey, let's go kick some
ass, man! " And...

288
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,210
What about you?

289
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:07,758
I play soccer,
basketball, baseball.

290
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:10,469
You know,
all the team sort of sports.

291
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:11,595
PAUL: Hey, man,

292
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,389
I wasn't generally
bagging on teams.

293
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,643
I mean, teams are great.
I'm just weird that way.

294
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,062
I like teams.
They're cool.

295
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,105
Cool.

296
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,233
So this is your
place, right?

297
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,027
Yeah, yeah, this is mine.
It's cool.

298
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,570
You know,
I've been working on it for a while.

299
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:33,408
I also have a little organic co-op farm just
up the street here.

300
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,828
Just keeping it kind
of local and organic

301
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,288
and simple,
American food.

302
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:40,415
That's so cool.
I'm totally into local.

303
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,085
PAUL: Yeah?
You are?

304
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,046
Yeah, Laser.

305
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:50,425
I've been trying to get
Moms, you know, to buy local for ages.

306
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:55,639
LASER: All right.

307
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,643
We're just over here. There.
LASER: Right. Yeah.

308
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,353
Okay.

309
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,771
Is that your bike?

310
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,690
Yeah, yeah.
You like motorcycles?

311
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:07,693
Yeah, I love them,

312
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:11,113
but, you know, our moms are kind
of anti-motorcycle.

313
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,949
By "kind of" he means that they'd
kill us if we ever rode one, so...

314
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,742
Oh, that's too bad.
They're a lot of fun.

315
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,285
Yeah, I'm sure.

316
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:20,956
Cool.

317
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,165
PAUL: Cool.
JONI: Yeah.

318
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:25,293
It was great...
Great meeting you, yeah.

319
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,586
N ice to meet you, too.

320
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,130
Yeah. It's okay,
right? Good?

321
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,297
JONI: Yeah, for sure.

322
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,549
Hey, Laser,
really nice to meet you.

323
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,718
Yeah, you too.

324
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:34,720
PAUL: All right.
LASER: All right.

325
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:35,804
So long.

326
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,055
Bye.

327
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,265
Keep in touch.
Yeah.

328
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:39,766
Okay?
Yeah.

329
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,191
(INAUDIBLE)

330
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:53,238
Wow. I just never pictured him
that way, you know?

331
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,699
He was so cool
and interesting.

332
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,325
Yeah, he's all right.

333
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,036
What do you mean
"all right"?

334
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,666
Laser, you're the one
who wanted to meet him so bad.

335
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,251
I know.

336
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,670
Yeah, so what did
you think of him?

337
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,088
I think he's all right.

338
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:12,883
I mean, I think he's
a little into himself.

339
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,719
God.
What?

340
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,471
You're asking my opinion.
Whatever.

341
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,556
We are so not telling Moms.

342
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,849
Why not?

343
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,142
Ha, ha. Very funny.

344
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:25,812
He wants to die!

345
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,190
He wants to die.

346
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,901
Remind me not to take
heroin in Morocco. Or Uganda.

347
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:34,279
Yeah. I hate it
when that happens.

348
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,699
MAN: (ON TV)
... it is now time to call it.

349
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:41,453
Someone took my knife.
I want my knife back!

350
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,954
(DOOR CLOSING)

351
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,956
Hey, bug, come here.

352
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,124
We're watching
Locked Up Abroad.

353
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:47,292
MAN: (ON TV)
I want my knife back!

354
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,460
Yeah, I've seen
that one. It's good.

355
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,795
Where you going?

356
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,379
Clay's.

357
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,464
NIC: Don't be back late.

358
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,590
I know, I know, I know.

359
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,467
Hey, hey. Come give us
a hug before you go.

360
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,510
H ugs.
Come on.

361
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:57,594
No, Mom.

362
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,596
Hug her. That's what
she's there for.

363
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,981
Maybe we should
just sit him down and ask him already.

364
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,984
What? "Are you
and Clay fucking?"

365
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,403
"Exploring" is
a better word.

366
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,322
Yeah, well, so, you know,
what if they are "exploring"?

367
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,825
This is the age for that.

368
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,117
We should be
good with that.

369
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,327
We should. We should.

370
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,996
I just don't understand
why he's exploring with that loser.

371
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:28,416
We don't really know what's going on.
We shouldn't jump to conclusions.

372
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,837
I feel like he has so much potential.
He's just wasting it.

373
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,255
(SCOFFING)

374
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,967
What are you
trying to say?

375
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,427
What do you mean,
what am I trying to say?

376
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,180
I just, you know,
I feel like there's some subtext here.

377
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:43,306
What are you
talking about?

378
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,517
You know,
"like mother, like son"?

379
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:51,106
Both of us wandering in the dark,
aimless, "wasting our potential. "

380
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,401
Honey, you're on
a whole other tangent.

381
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,528
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

382
00:19:56,612 --> 00:20:01,283
Well, you know, maybe it hasn't risen to
the plane of consciousness for you yet.

383
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,121
Yeah. Maybe.

384
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,337
Someone took my knife.

385
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,256
So what were they like?

386
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,341
They were
really sweet kids.

387
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:24,264
The boy was this little, you know,
kind of sensitive jock-type kid,

388
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:27,058
and the girl was
really innocent

389
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:31,730
but just whip-smart
and super, super cute.

390
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:34,816
Sounds like you really liked them,
like you guys connected.

391
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:40,113
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I kind of did.

392
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:43,491
Wow.
So how'd you leave it?

393
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,951
I mean, are you
gonna see them again?

394
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,244
I... Hey, Brooke.

395
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:47,704
Hey, Paul.
Check these out.

396
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,080
PAUL: How you doing?
BROOKE: Good.

397
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,041
Wow, look at those
strawberries, man.

398
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,083
They're just...

399
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,251
Aren't they beautiful?

400
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:55,003
I thought you should
have the first taste.

401
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:56,671
Thank you.

402
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,387
"I thought you should
have the first taste" of my pussy.

403
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,015
(LAUGHING)
I'm sorry.

404
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,937
Dude, I don't even
think they smoke pot.

405
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:14,022
Dude, hold up.

406
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,111
(CLAY EXCLAIMING)

407
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,364
Come on, let's go.
Seriously.

408
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,865
(BUZZING)

409
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,617
Oh! Dude!

410
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,077
God, disgusting!
Come on, let's go.

411
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,286
It's alive, dude!

412
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:29,454
Put it back.

413
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,956
Fine, fine, fine.

414
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,208
Sweet!

415
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,336
Dude, we're watching this.

416
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,808
You think the whole
thing's like this?

417
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:52,310
LASER: Maybe...

418
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:54,646
Maybe we should
fast forward.

419
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:16,251
Laser, you left your bike
in the driveway again.

420
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:26,386
NIC: Laser, your mom and I accept and
love you unconditionally.

421
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,596
You know that, right?

422
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:29,806
Yeah.

423
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:34,352
Yeah. And you know that you can be
open with us about anything.

424
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,689
Yeah, I know.
Okay.

425
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:41,735
Laser, do you want to talk to us
about anything?

426
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:42,902
Like what?

427
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,070
J ust anything.

428
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:46,823
You know, anything
on your mind.

429
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:53,288
Well, there is something.
But it's more of a question, though.

430
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,539
That's okay.

431
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,583
We won't judge you.

432
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,796
Why do you guys
watch gay man porn?

433
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:08,970
Well, first I have to say
that we rarely watch that movie.

434
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,221
Honey.

435
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,557
And, second,
I really don't appreciate

436
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,309
you snooping around
our room, okay?

437
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,269
Was that Clay's idea?
No, Mom.

438
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,730
Wait a minute.
I have to say, again, I don't like him.

439
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,065
I know. I know.

440
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:21,983
Okay, he seems unstable.

441
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,943
Honey, honey,
that's not what he asked.

442
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,487
Do you want to answer
his question?

443
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:26,946
Yeah, okay.

444
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:32,535
Well, sweetie, you know,
human sexuality is complicated.

445
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:36,915
And sometimes desire can be,
you know, counterintuitive.

446
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,750
You know, for example,

447
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:42,545
because women's
sexual responsiveness is internalized,

448
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:46,674
sometimes it's exciting for us to
see responsiveness externalized,

449
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,552
like with a...
Like with a penis.

450
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,514
Wouldn't you guys just rather
watch girls doing it, though?

451
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,099
Well, you would think that.

452
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:58,228
But usually in these movies,
they hire two straight women to pretend,

453
00:23:58,312 --> 00:23:59,687
and the inauthenticity
is just unbearable.

454
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,356
Whoa, that's enough.

455
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:07,612
Laser, your mom
and I sense

456
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,781
that there's some
other stuff going on in your life.

457
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,908
We just want
to be let in.

458
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,451
What do you mean?

459
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:16,579
Are you having a relationship
with someone?

460
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:20,583
You can tell us, honey.
We would understand and support you.

461
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:23,711
Look, I only met him once.

462
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:26,047
What do you mean once?

463
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:27,382
Did he find you online?
NIC: Wait.

464
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:28,800
What?
Wait, wait, who did you meet once?

465
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:29,968
Paul. I met him with Joni.

466
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:31,052
JULES: Paul? Who's Paul?

467
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,012
Why was Joni there?
She set it up.

468
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:35,390
Wait, forget the set-up.
Who's Paul?

469
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,933
Our sperm donor.

470
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,733
Did you guys think
I was gay?

471
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,486
No.

472
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:49,737
No way.

473
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,489
JULES: Of course not.

474
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:53,825
Yeah, I mean, we understand
that you'd be curious

475
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,493
about your biological father.

476
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:57,829
I mean,
it's completely natural.

477
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,789
But why didn't you tell us?

478
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:01,082
Because we knew
you'd be upset.

479
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,959
We're not upset!
No, no, no.

480
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:06,171
We're not. We wish that
you'd included us in the conversation.

481
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,380
That's all.

482
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:11,301
You know? But...
But you met him, and that's cool.

483
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:13,428
And now,
we can move on.

484
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,348
Actually,
I want to see him again.

485
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,851
You do?

486
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,311
Yeah, I was
gonna tell you.

487
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:24,230
Well, no. Okay?
No way.

488
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:27,108
No one's seeing anyone
until we meet him.

489
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,825
I get it, okay? He's their biological
father and all that crap.

490
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,370
But it still feels
really shitty.

491
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:42,373
Like we're not enough
or something, you know?

492
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:45,001
Of course I know.
You know, I don't...

493
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:48,254
I don't want to time-share
our kids with anybody.

494
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:52,383
Especially when it's Joni's last summer
at home.

495
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:53,676
No way.

496
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,141
Jesus, Jules!

497
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:03,895
The plumber was just here.
God, it's gross.

498
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:08,566
(SOFTLY) Look, we have to be
smart about this.

499
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:13,112
You know, if we act like grubby bitches,
we're just gonna make it worse.

500
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:14,906
I know.

501
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,910
Let's just kill him
with kindness and put it to bed.

502
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,745
I'm with you, honey.

503
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,540
We're gonna get
through this, okay?

504
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:28,002
I love you, chicken.

505
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,921
I love you, too, pony.

506
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:10,461
Paul. It's so great
to meet you. H i. Yeah.

507
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,964
Great to meet you, too.

508
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,215
Hey. Jules.
Hello, Jules.

509
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,967
I'm Nic.
Hi, Nic.

510
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,051
Hi.

511
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,803
I hope the traffic
wasn't too bad.

512
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,472
No, I took my motorcycle,
so I pretty much just weave through it.

513
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:22,807
Oh, great.

514
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,892
I brought you this.

515
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,311
I don't know if
you folks drink wine.

516
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:28,146
Oh, no, are you kidding?
We love it.

517
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,982
Wow, a Petite Sirah.
What a treat!

518
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,358
'86.

519
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,527
Yeah. I'll get some glasses.
All right.

520
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,618
Yeah. Wow.

521
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:44,495
Beautiful house.
Yeah, thanks. Thanks.

522
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,621
You guys been here
a long time?

523
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:48,416
Yeah. You know,
about 10 years.

524
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,501
God, has it been
that long? I mean...

525
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:54,922
That's... Yeah.
You know them, yeah.

526
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,467
Hey, Joni.
How you doing?

527
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:59,302
Good, how are you?
Good.

528
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,179
Hey, man.
Hey.

529
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:02,638
What's up, man?

530
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:04,182
You okay?

531
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,934
Yeah. Yeah, great.

532
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,479
Go easy on the wine, hon.
It's daytime.

533
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:12,565
Okay. Same goes for the micromanaging.
Okay?

534
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:21,032
So, Paul, did you
always know that...

535
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,116
Yes.

536
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:25,495
...that you wanted to be
in the food services industry?

537
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:28,623
I always liked food.

538
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,041
Oh, yeah.

539
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:33,336
No, I was asking because I remember
when I was reading your file,

540
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,963
back when we were
looking for,

541
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,424
you know, sperm...

542
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,967
Can I have the potato
salad, babe? Sure.

543
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:43,846
Anyway, you said that you were studying
international relations.

544
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:48,142
Oh, yeah. Wow, that was a...
That was a long time ago.

545
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:53,523
Yeah, I was considering it,
but then I dropped out of school.

546
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:58,903
You dropped
out of college?

547
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,696
Yeah, it just
wasn't my thing.

548
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,615
No? Why's that?
PAUL: I don't know.

549
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:06,119
It just seemed like a massive waste
of money after a while, you know?

550
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:08,996
I was just sitting
on my ass listening to people spout ideas.

551
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,582
I could just as easily
have learned in a book.

552
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,044
Oh.

553
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,088
Okay.

554
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,298
I'm not saying that,
you know,

555
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:22,135
I think that higher learning
uniformly blows.

556
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,595
You know, I think
college is great for some people.

557
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,264
Joni, I'm sure
you're gonna love it.

558
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:29,267
But just... I'm a doer.
That's how I learn.

559
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:33,229
It's just me.
I'm weird that way, I guess. Thank you.

560
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:36,023
Which is probably why
I'm in the food services industry.

561
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,108
(ALL LAUGHING)

562
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,276
Right.

LASER: Hey, Mom,
you see what he did there, right?

564
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:41,487
You said "food
services industry,"

565
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:43,823
so then he said
"food services industry. "

566
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,700
Yeah. I got that,
Laser. Thanks.

567
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,621
So, Paul,
what about your...

568
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:53,166
What about
your social life?

569
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,168
My social life?

570
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:57,795
Yeah, you know,
are you married, divorced, seeing anyone?

571
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,297
Mom.
NIC: What?

572
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,549
We're getting
to know Paul. It's okay.

573
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:07,388
No, no, it's okay. I...
No, I've never been married nor divorced.

574
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:08,514
I date sometimes,

575
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:12,602
but I'm really just
kind of focused on my restaurant right now.

576
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:19,650
NIC: Well, that's...
Yeah. Makes sense.

577
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,152
So, cheers.

578
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,695
Yeah. Cheers.

579
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,113
Excellent wine,
by the way.

580
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:25,239
Thank you.

581
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,743
How old are you again?

582
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,829

NIC: No, that's okay.

585

JULES: I like
to be positive.

586
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:41,756
NIC: Yeah.

587
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,965
So how'd you two meet?

588
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:45,426
We met at UCLA.

589
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,178
I was a resident,

590
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,224
and Jules had
an emergency.

591
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:52,308
My tongue was numb.

Oh, my God.

00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,856
It's not nice.

596
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:02,151
No, that's not nice. I mean, we've heard
that story 100, 000 times.

597
00:31:02,236 --> 00:31:03,861
What happened to your tongue?
I don't know.

598
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:08,199
I mean, I lost all the feeling in my face
and my tongue.

599
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:11,869
And then, you know, I got really nervous
'cause I thought that I was gonna gag

600
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:13,538
and, you know,
maybe like...

601
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,039
Choke? Die?

602
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,374
Yeah, exactly.

603
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:17,458
What'd you do to help her?

604
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:18,584
NIC: I gave her a Valium,

605
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:21,963
and I told her to relax
and tried to get her to talk,

606
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:24,131
you know, move her tongue around.
Yeah.

607
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,384
Actually, she started teasing me,
and that really helped.

608
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,010
I was trying
to distract you.

609
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:31,305
I know. It worked.
You were really funny.

610
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,558
You were really pretty.

611
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:36,894

my tongue started working again.

you into, Jules?

What do you do?

622
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:06,424
Well, you know, I mean, I studied
architecture in college.

623
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:07,508
PAUL: Right.

624
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:09,051
But I'm not
really an architect.

625
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:10,761
I mean, I was on my way
to becoming one,

626
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:13,264
but I quit before
the kids were born.

627
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,473
That happens.

628
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:15,850
And then when they got
a little bit older,

629
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,436
I started a Balinese furniture
import business.

630
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,937
Right on.

631

But that didn't
really work out.

businesses aren't easy.

00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:24,483
Yeah.

But I'm in the process
of starting a new business.

00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,280
Great, good for you.
What's that?

636
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,616
Landscape design.
I mean, you know, not gardening.

I mean, you know,
there's a gardening component,

638
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:39,624

is in creating unique,

tell Paul about your graduation speech?

wisdom and hope.

You know, I was thinking.

661
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:42,144
I just bought this place
last year, and it's...

662
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,271
I mean,
the backyard's a wreck.

663
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:48,401
Would you be interested in maybe
coming and doing some work for me?

That's okay.

I can't...

666
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,698
I don't have time
to do it myself and...

667
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:55,491
Well, I mean,
that's really sweet of you,

668
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:56,867
but you should think
about it, you know.

669
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:58,703
PAUL: No, why?
I just did.

670
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:03,207
I mean, it's all right
if you're not up for it. It's okay.

671
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:07,461
No, I am.
I'm up for it. Yeah.

677
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:17,972
Right on.
Yeah.

678
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:24,186
I'm just saying,
the plan was to limit his involvement.

679
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:26,731
You're unbelievable.
I mean, you're all about me getting clients.

680
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,649
And then I get a client,
and you're like, "Oh, no, not him. "

681
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:30,735
Yeah. But he's not
just a client, Jules.

682
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,194
He's our sperm donor.

683
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:35,656
I mean, haven't you heard the expression
"don't shit where you eat"?

684
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:38,409
Yes, and I think
it's disgusting.

685
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:46,333
Okay, I'm sorry. Look, he just seemed
so self-satisfied to me.

686
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:49,420
You know?

687
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:52,423
Yeah, he was working
the "alternative" thing pretty hard.

688
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,759
Oh, my God.
When he said that thing about,

689
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:59,096
"Oh, I just need to get outside and do
things, not sit on my ass and learn.

690
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:02,433
"But that's just me, you know.
I'm weird that way. "

691
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:13,569
(SIGHING)

692
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:18,532
I'd certainly clean up a lot of this grass.
It's pretty... It's wasted.

693
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:19,784
Sure.

694
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:22,495
The lavender
is so nice.

695
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:26,457
And with the sun that
you have, that and, like, that rosemary,

696
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,876
which kind of grow everywhere,
and you wouldn't even have

697
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,960
to think about it.
Yeah.

698
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:35,674
You could go like a whole,
like, Secret Garden, kind of a trellis-y,

699
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:38,302
like hidden kind of thing.

700
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:43,432
Or you could, you know,
you could go like Asian-y.

701
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:47,353
Minimal. You know, like rocks
and kind of all clean and...

702
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:50,731
Whatever you think.

703
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:52,399
Well,
what do you think?

704
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:56,237
You know what? I'm not...
I'm not feeling minimal.

705
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,948
I really... I'm really
liking more is more.

706
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:02,159
You know? I mean,
let's not try to tame this space, okay?

707
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:03,953
Let's just let it be
like lush,

708
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:07,957
overgrown, fecund.

709
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,210
Fecund.

710
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:15,422
Like fertile, yeah?

711
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:18,759
No, I love that word. You just, you don't
hear people use it very often.

712
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,511
No, yeah.

713
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:24,014
Yeah, more is more.
Yeah, I like that.

714
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:26,100
Right on.
Let's do that.

715
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,438
I'm sorry.
What?

716
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,861
I just keep seeing
my kids' expressions in your face.

717
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:37,987
Really?
Yeah.

718
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:41,657
Like that. Like, "Really?"
Like, yeah. That's like Laser.

719
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:46,829
Hmm.

720
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,122
Well...

721
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:57,256
Do you like patios?

722
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,716
Yeah, patios are good. Okay.

723
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,050
Yeah.

724
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:01,969
We could put a patio up there.
Where?

725
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,470
Let's take a look.

726
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:08,392
SASHA: Hello. Donor Dad?
Stone cold fox.

727
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,895
Must you take everything beautiful
and make it dirty?

728
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,897
Okay.

729
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:16,525
I'm just saying.
Spermster's a hottie.

730
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,193
Is he single?

731
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:21,238
(GROANING) Okay.
First of all, ew,

732
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:23,324
and second,
he's a really good person.

733
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:27,536
So I'd prefer it if you didn't taint him
with your whore juice.

734
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:31,373
Fair enough, hairy muff.
I'm out of here.

735
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:34,418
You lovebirds can
split my letters.

736
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:42,343
Do you want
to keep playing?

737
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:43,719
Sure.

738
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,054
Okay.

739
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,229
Sometimes I feel sorry
for Sasha, you know?

740
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:55,522
Yeah.

741
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:03,822
It's like she has to sexualize
every experience, you know?

742
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:05,324
It's just sad.

743
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,868
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
That's sad.

744
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,920
JULES: Oh, come on.

745
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,922
Hi ya, what's the score?

746
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,298
Pretty close.

747
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:22,967
NIC: Yeah?
20 to three. Match point.

748
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,761
So how'd it go today?

749
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:28,889
It was good.
We settled on a concept.

750
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:31,225
Ah. What is it?

751
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,185
Well, you know,
it's kind of...

752
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,813
It's kind of hard to explain.

753
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:38,315
You really have
to see the space.

754
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:44,279
Okay. Hey, Laser, did you write the
get-well card for Pup-pup?

755
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,240
(SIGHING)

756
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,075
Laser, come on.

757
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,662
What do I have to do? I bought
you the card. I put it on your desk.

758
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,831
All you have
to do is sign it.

759
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,457
Mom, just settle down,
okay? I'll do it.

760
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:58,752
Hey. You don't tell me
to settle, mister.

761
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:02,756
If it's not in the mail
by tomorrow morning,

762
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,134
we're not going to the Dodger game
Saturday, okay?

763
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:07,720
Whatever. I have
other plans anyways.

764
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:09,096
What other plans?

765
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:12,933
I asked you a question.

766
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:16,770
I said I'd do something
with Paul, okay? God!

767
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,943
Shit!

768
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:28,866
I believe this might not
be such a good idea.

769
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,075
Are you filming?
Yeah.

770
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,911
He's not gonna make that.
You're not gonna make that, Clay. No way.

771
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:34,496
Let's do something
different.

772
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:37,374
Will you quit being
such a choch and run the camera?

773
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:39,710
I'm only doing this once,
so keep my shit in frame.

774
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:45,382
LASER: All right.

775
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,972
All right, I got it.

776
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:57,853
(GROANING)

777
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,021
Shit! Dude!

778
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:00,397
(GROANING)

779
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:01,523
Clay, are you all right?
Fuck!

780
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:03,609
Did you get it, dude?
PAUL: Clay, you all right, bro?

781
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:05,319
Seriously, are you okay?
I'm fucking fine! Fuck!

782
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,821
Did you fucking
get it? God!

783
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:10,157
Yeah, I got it.

784
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,493
Fuck, dude.
PAUL: Clay...

785
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,495
That was fucking crazy.

786
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:17,372
PAUL: Where's your place,
Clay, up here?

787
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:20,626
CLAY: Yeah, right here
on the right.

788
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,544
This is good.
PAUL: Cool here?

789
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:24,213
Yeah.

790
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:26,465
You take care.
Later.

791
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,883
See you.

792
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,099
Let's wait till
he gets to the house.

793
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:40,020
Maybe we could hang out together just
you and me next time.

794
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:44,608
Clay's cool. He just...
You know, he gets a little amped sometimes.

795
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:48,529
That's not amped, man.
That's being a tool.

796
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,572
No, he's not a tool, okay?
That's just his way.

797
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:53,117
Yeah, I don't like the way
he was talking to you at all.

798
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:54,952
Well, you know what?
You don't know him very well, do you?

799
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,746
I mean, you hung out
with him once.

800
00:40:57,831 --> 00:41:00,124
You're right.
I don't know him.

801
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:05,504
Can I ask you something?

802
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:06,839
Sure.

803
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:10,676
Why'd you donate sperm?

804
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:18,559
It just seemed like a lot more fun than
donating blood.

805
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:27,484
No, I loved the idea
of helping people.

806
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:32,322
People who were in need, you know,
wanted to have kids and couldn't.

807
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,825
So then you did it
to help people?

808
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,745
It was a long time ago.

809
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:42,541
How much did you
get paid?

810
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,835
Why do you want
to know that?

811
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,545
I'm just curious.

812
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:52,551
I got paid 60 bucks a pop.

813
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,179
That's it?

814
00:41:55,889 --> 00:41:58,599
Well, it was, like,
a lot of money to me at the time.

815
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:02,936
And with inflation,
it's like $90 today.

816
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,104
Hey.

817
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:07,858
I'm glad I did it.

818
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,455
Whoa.

819
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:23,332
What's this?

820
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:24,791
H i. Come here.

821
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:28,170
Come here. Sit down.

822
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:38,513
I'm sorry that
I've been so edgy lately, you know.

823
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:41,099
I know I haven't
been my highest self.

824
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:42,351
Yeah.

825
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:46,188
And you've been
really patient with me.

826
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:50,776
And I just want you to know that that
hasn't gone unrecognized, okay?

827
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,416
How's the water?

828
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:09,503
It's perfect.
You wanna come in?

829
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,173
In a minute.
You enjoy it first.

830
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,343
(SIGHING)

831
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:20,597
I forgot
the lavender bath salts.

832
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:22,391
Oh, I don't care.
No, no, no.

833
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:24,309
I wanna get them.
I got them special.

834
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:26,270
Don't go. Don't.

835
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,398
Don't move.
I'll be right back.

836
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,858
(SIGHING)

837
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:50,419
Nic?

838
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:54,756
Hey, Nic?

839
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:57,884
Jesus!

840
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:01,555
NIC: U h-huh.

841
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,350
Right. No,
I understand.

842
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:10,105
I understand where the pain is, but
it doesn't sound like a contraction.

843
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,774
It sounds more like gas.
(MOUTHING) I'm sorry.

844
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:14,067
Fuck!

845
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,987
Right. Okay.

846
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:20,282
All right, this is our plan.
I don't think you should worry,

847
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:23,493
and I think you should
just call me back if it continues.

848
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:32,336
PAUL: You sure you don't
want any coffee?

849
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,587
No thanks.

850
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,047
It's good.

851
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:36,340
JULES: I'm all right.

852
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:40,135
But I think I'm gonna go
to the nursery tomorrow,

853
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:43,263
so I want you to sign off on
this Bougainvillea.

854
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:44,598
PAUL: Sure.

855
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:46,266
What is this?
Did you make it?

856
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:48,935
Yeah. That's some pie I made.
It's right from my garden.

857
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,812
It's strawberry-rhubarb.

858
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:52,481
Here. Try.

859
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:55,192
Yeah, okay.
Twist my arm.

860
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:01,490
Oh, my God.
It's good, huh?

861
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:02,699
That's criminal.
Have some more.

862
00:45:02,784 --> 00:45:04,117
No. No, please,

I can't fucking believe it.
Okay.

1044
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:51,347
You gotta go talk to him.
Are you gonna go talk to him?

1045
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:53,433
Okay. Fuck.
Oh, God.

Hey, what's up?

00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:07,822
Where do you
want the stones?

1051
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:09,115
Stones?

1052
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:12,160
Over by the fence.

1053
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:15,496
What?

1054
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:19,042
I was using the bathroom.

1055
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:22,462
Do you need to use
the bathroom?

1056
00:56:24,256 --> 00:56:26,382
Okay, then.
I'll be right back.

1057
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:28,259
Okay.
Take your time.

Now you don't have
to go easy on me because you're winning.

a show-off, man.

Would you rather
be buried or cremated?

That's your question?

1071
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,672
I'd rather be cremated.

1072
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:09,717
I think I'd...
(EXCLAIMING)

1073
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:12,762
I think I'd rather
be buried.

1074
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,514
But why? I mean,

1075
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:16,474
you're just gonna be
taking up more space in the earth.

1076
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:18,101
I don't know. The idea of being,
you know,

1077
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:22,772
torched into a chalky white substance
has got me a little freaked out.

1078
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:25,191
Why does it matter to you?
You're not even gonna be conscious.

1079
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,610
Okay, well, maybe,
I don't know,

1080
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:30,029
I want a place for people to come
and visit me one day.

1081
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:31,280
But why?
You're gonna be dead.

1082
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:33,157
You won't even
know they're there.

1083
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:39,080
Okay. Take it easy.

1084
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:41,958
Come on.

1085
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:44,919

Nike or New Balance?

Sure.

It's so beautiful.

1090
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,348
Thank you.

1091

Is it African?

Yes, it's Ethiopian.

00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:01,769
Did you get it there?

1094
00:58:01,854 --> 00:58:04,689
No, I got it at a flea market
in Brooklyn.

1095
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,525
Is that where you're from?

1096
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,318
No, I'm from here.

Cool.
Hey, guys, how you doing?

1098
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:14,490
Good.
How's the food?

1099
00:58:14,575 --> 00:58:15,575
It's great.

1100
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:16,826
Good? You're not
gonna eat your chicken?

1101
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,494
It's so yummy.
It's good?

1102

Yeah, it's really good.

I'm sorry, but I have to take the lovely
Tanya away for a moment.

All right. It was lovely
talking to you, ladies.

1105
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:29,255
You, too.
You, too.

1106
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:38,848
Okay, I'm sorry, but your donor daddy
is giving me the sex vibe.

1107
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:41,017
No, he's not.
He wouldn't do that.

1108
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:43,519
Why not?
He's not my dad.

1109

God, Sasha,
that's totally gross!

1110
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:49,525
Not everybody
wants to have sex with you, okay?

1111
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:52,653
Especially when
you act like a slut.

1112
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:53,821
Fuck you.

1113
00:58:53,906 --> 00:58:57,200
Well, it makes you seem insecure
and desperate.

1114
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:59,535
I'm not insecure
and desperate.

1115
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:02,330
I'm just a normal,
sexual person.

1116
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:06,209
Maybe you'd understand that
if you weren't so uptight.

1117
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:09,170
Fuck you.
I'm not uptight.

these heirloom tomatoes are amazing.

they're in season.

Paul's garden the other day.

1121
00:59:19,765 --> 00:59:21,265
They were huge.

1122
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:23,601
So the kids have
been spending time with him?

1123
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:27,980
Yeah. Yeah, they're
spending all kinds of quality time together.

1124
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:30,900
Well, you're lucky. You're lucky that
the kids bonded with the donor.

1125
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,818
I mean, you hear so
many nightmare stories.

1126
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:36,948
No, no, it's great.
They all just get along famously.

1127

can do no wrong.

Excuse me. Could we get
another bottle of the Seavey Cabernet?

I don't need any more.

on this one, N icole.

whole acai smoothie craze?

JULES: Acai fruit packs.

1133
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:57,593
Yeah. No, but they're pushing them like
crack at Whole Foods.

1134
00:59:57,678 --> 01:00:00,346
Joel is so addicted to it.
He buys it by the case.

1135

JOEL: Here's what I do.

1136
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:07,270
I throw one in the blender with bananas,
frozen strawberries and hemp milk.

1137
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:09,855
And I'll tell you what,
it is pretty sensational.

1138
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,857
J ust fucking kill me.
Okay?

1139
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:13,693
Honey.
I'm sorry, guys,

1140
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:18,906
but I just can't with the fucking hemp milk
and the organic farming.

1141
01:00:18,991 --> 01:00:22,243
And, you know, if I hear one more person
say that they love heirloom tomatoes,

1142
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:24,287
I'm gonna fucking
kill myself. Okay?

1143
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:27,456
Oh. And do you know
that we're composting now?

1144
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:30,543
Oh, yeah.
"No, don't throw that in the trash.

feel good about ourselves. " You know?

1148
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:44,557
I can't do it, okay?
I can't fucking do it.

01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:50,396

some green tea?

1150
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:55,443
You know what, J ules?
I like my wine, okay? So fucking sue me.

1151
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:58,988
And FYI, red wine
has a chemical called resveratrol in it,

1152
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:02,325
which has been proven
to significantly extend human lifespan.

a thousand glasses a day, yeah.

Okay, I'm sorry,
all right?

1169
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,087
I guess I'm just exhausted.

1170
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:01,050
Yeah, maybe you just
need to take some time off, recharge.

1171
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:02,218
Right?

1172
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:04,053
Yeah, right.
Who's gonna pay for that?

1173
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:07,932
I mean, look,
I'm sorry,

1174
01:02:08,016 --> 01:02:10,393
but, you know, I feel
like I'm carrying the whole load here.

1175
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:13,062
Yeah, 'cause that's
the way you like it.

1176
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:14,647
That's the way
you keep control.

1177
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:16,440
What are you
talking about?

1178
01:02:16,525 --> 01:02:18,901
Come on,
you hated it when I worked.

1179
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:20,653
You wanted me at home
taking care of the kids.

1180
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,571
You wanted a wife.
That is just not true.

1181
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:24,198
No, you didn't like
any of the nannies,

1182
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:26,075
and you sure didn't
back my career.

1183
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:30,413
What are you talking about? I just
helped you start another business.

1184
01:02:30,497 --> 01:02:33,499
Yeah, so you can feel
better about yourself.

1185
01:02:34,835 --> 01:02:38,879
No, Jules.
So you can feel better about yourself.

1186
01:02:40,841 --> 01:02:43,467
Are you even attracted
to me anymore?

1187
01:02:45,053 --> 01:02:47,638

still like the wine?

check from inside, please.

1189
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:53,352

1190
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:57,773
Oh, yeah. Pull my hair.

1191
01:02:57,858 --> 01:02:59,650
PAUL: Okay. Oh, yeah.

1192
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:03,195
Okay.

1193

(JULES MOANING)

1195
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:20,129
I really want a cigarette.
I haven't smoked since Laser was born.

1196
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:23,632
Do you smoke?
Do you have a cigarette?

1197
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:25,176
Sometimes,
but I don't have any.

1198
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,886
I could go run out
and get you some.

1199

Yeah. Yeah, no, no.
No, don't go.

I'm some sad-sack,
middle-aged lesbian?

1203
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:46,197
You know, I have been trying to come up
with a way to describe you to my friends,

1204
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:47,740
and now I finally have it.
Thank you so much.

1205
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:48,991
(PHONE RINGING)

1206
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:51,243
(LAUGHING)
Fuck you.

1207
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:53,662
You want to get that?

1208
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:55,456
No, no. I want
to get some of this.

1209
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:56,540
(BEEPING)

1210
01:03:56,625 --> 01:03:57,750
Paul, it's Joni.

1211
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:02,004
I just wanted to call you
and apologize for my friend Sasha.

1212
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:04,423
You know, when you put
your hands on her shoulders,

1213
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:06,091
I think that
she thought that...

1214
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:07,843
Hey, Joni. It's Paul.
(MOUTHING) Don't get that.

1215
01:04:07,928 --> 01:04:09,845
Listen, I'm really sorry
about Sasha the other night.

1216
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:14,308
No, I didn't even... No, no. No...
Really, I didn't even notice that.

1217
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:15,351
I hope you didn't
feel uncomfortable.

1218
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:18,103
No, not at all. I...
(STUTTERING)

1219
01:04:18,939 --> 01:04:20,022
Not at all.

1220
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:22,107
Okay, sure.
Well, as long as... Hold on, hold on.

1221
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:23,359
(WHISPERING)
Wait, wait, wait.

1222
01:04:23,443 --> 01:04:24,860
No, just get off me.

1223
01:04:24,945 --> 01:04:26,153
I'm just gonna...
Give me one second.

1224
01:04:26,238 --> 01:04:28,030
Get off.

1225
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,157
Jone?

1226
01:04:30,242 --> 01:04:31,492
Oh, is my mom there?

1227
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:34,745
Your mom?
No, no. She split.

1228
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:37,039
She went on
a Home Depot run.

1229
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:45,714
Did you go to Home Depot?

1230
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:47,883
Yeah. J ust got back.

1231
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:51,679
That was fast.

1232
01:04:51,763 --> 01:04:53,305
Yeah, no lines.

1233
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:01,522
What's that look
you're giving me?

1234
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:02,690
What look?

1235
01:05:02,774 --> 01:05:06,193
The look that you're
giving me right now.

1236
01:05:06,278 --> 01:05:10,155
No. That's no look.
That's just my face.

1237
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,409
Yeah, I'm not gonna play
this game with you.

1238
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:15,911
You know, you can
keep your judgments to yourself.

1239
01:05:15,996 --> 01:05:18,205
No. I didn't give
no looks, señora.

1240
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:20,874
I don't ask
why you blow your nose all the time.

1241
01:05:20,959 --> 01:05:23,002
If you have a drug problem,
then that's your business.

1242
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:25,713
No, I don't have
no drug problem.

1243
01:05:25,797 --> 01:05:26,797
I have allergies.

1244
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:29,592
Then why are
you a gardener?

1245
01:05:29,676 --> 01:05:31,844
'Cause I love
the flowers.

1246
01:05:33,013 --> 01:05:34,597
Man, this is
not gonna work.

1247
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:36,849
You know, I'm gonna pay you
through the end of the day,

1248
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,268
and then we're through. Okay?

1249
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:40,561
(SPEAKS SPANISH)

1250
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:41,770
Thank you very much.

1251
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:43,522
Thanks. Thank you.

1252
01:05:46,735 --> 01:05:47,776
Can we talk about...

1253
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:48,944
No, we can't.

1254
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:50,613
LUIS: A little bit.
You know why?

1255
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:52,156
'Cause there's nothing
to talk about.

1256
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,033
I think you know.

1257
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:57,036
You know.

1258
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:44,958
Look.

1259
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:49,296
I know you've all
been enjoying your time with Paul.

1260
01:06:49,381 --> 01:06:54,343
And I know that I haven't
been as open to him as everybody else,

1261
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,595
and that's caused some
friction between us.

1262
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:00,516
But I'd like to try
and change that, okay?

1263
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,518
So I was thinking

1264
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:05,729
it might be nice if we all had dinner at
his house sometime.

1265
01:07:05,814 --> 01:07:08,107
Now that way, I could get to know him
a little bit better,

1266
01:07:08,191 --> 01:07:13,028
and I could see all the good work
that Mom's been doing in the backyard.

1267
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:17,032
What do you think? Yeah?
Sure.

1268
01:07:17,117 --> 01:07:18,200
NIC: Yeah.
Sure.

1269
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:19,368
Yeah?

1270
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:20,536
JONI: Yeah.

1271
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:21,745
Great.

1272
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:24,164
It's not...
I'm not done yet.

1273
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:25,332
You know,
I'm not, you know...

1274
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:26,583
No. No, I know.

1275
01:07:26,668 --> 01:07:28,585
I haven't done all
the planting or anything.

1276
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:30,045
But I wanna see
the process.

1277
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:32,339
You know, like other colors,
other than green colors.

1278
01:07:32,424 --> 01:07:35,217
Well, that's okay.
I just wanna see the process.

1279
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:36,802
Great.

1280
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:39,513
(GRUNTING)

1281
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:40,639
PAUL: Hey.

1282
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:44,685
Need a hand?
JULES: Sure.

1283
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:51,650
Hold on.
Let me help you.

1284
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:53,694
Ready? Okay.

1285
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:55,154
Right here.

1286
01:07:57,532 --> 01:07:58,615
Yeah.

1287
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:06,707
We can't be doing this.

1288
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:09,418
I know. This is...

1289
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:10,836
I'm married.

1290
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,212
The kids.

1291
01:08:12,297 --> 01:08:14,548
Yeah, and I love Nic, so...

1292
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:16,216
Hey.
I don't...

1293
01:08:16,301 --> 01:08:17,885
It was fun while it lasted.

1294
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:19,803
Sorry.

1295
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:26,935
I bought you
some cigarettes.

1296
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:30,856
Jesus. What is
wrong with me?

1297
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:35,736
I shouldn't have fired Luis like that.
That was so wrong.

1298
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,946
Yeah, I think you're
being hard on yourself.

1299
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:40,491
You know, I mean,
things just get messed up sometimes.

1300
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:44,703
No, no, that wasn't messy.
That was fucked up.

1301
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:49,208
I am so fucked up.

1302
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:52,920
I...

1303
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:57,174
I think
I'm falling for you.

1304
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:00,552
Oh, God, Paul.

1305
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,305
Don't.

1306
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:30,040
Tonight was
a really good night.

1307
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:31,166
Yeah.

1308
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:34,711
That one table had, like,
five bottles of wine.

1309
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:38,757
It was crazy.
It was a big night.

1310
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:41,677
You know,
Joni's really pretty.

1311
01:09:41,761 --> 01:09:44,179
I think she's got
some of your genes.

1312
01:09:44,264 --> 01:09:46,849
You think? I think she looks more like
her mom, but thanks.

1313
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:48,183
I appreciate that.

1314
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:51,270
It was really cute
seeing you in Dad mode.

1315
01:09:51,354 --> 01:09:52,604
Yeah?

1316
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:55,649
Yeah.

1317
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:57,734
It made me want
to fuck you.

1318
01:09:58,862 --> 01:09:59,987
Yeah?

1319
01:10:00,071 --> 01:10:01,113
Yeah.

1320
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:04,825
You know, I've been
missing our sleepovers.

1321
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:08,287
Yeah, we haven't
been doing that in a while, have we?

1322
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:09,913
Mmm-mmm.

1323
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:13,792
You want to meet up later?

1324
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:16,461
(SIGHING) Tanya,

1325
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:20,966
you're so sexy
and beautiful, but I...

1326
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:25,345
I don't think
we should do that anymore.

1327
01:10:26,514 --> 01:10:29,516
You know,
what we have is really fun and easy,

1328
01:10:29,601 --> 01:10:33,687
but I don't want to be that, like, 50- year-
old guy who's just hanging out, you know?

1329
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:35,606
I really do want
to have a family,

1330
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:40,319
and I need to be doing that with someone
who's, like, ready to go there with me.

1331
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,237
Oh.

1332
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:47,242
Okay.

1333
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:50,579
Tanya.

1334
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:58,921
Yeah? Fuck you.

1335
01:11:24,572 --> 01:11:25,989
It's locked.

1336
01:11:34,332 --> 01:11:37,459
Yeah, I mean, obviously I have
more to do down here.

1337
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:39,962
I gotta fill it in,
but this is the general idea.

1338
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:42,589
No, it looks great.

1339
01:11:42,674 --> 01:11:43,674
Yeah?

1340
01:11:43,758 --> 01:11:44,800
It's so indigenous.

1341
01:11:44,884 --> 01:11:46,551
Really.
I am so proud of you.

1342
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:49,513
Yeah, you like it?
Yeah?

1343
01:11:49,597 --> 01:11:51,223
I'm so proud.

1344
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:57,354
I love you, honey.

1345
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:59,231
I love you, too.

1346
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,358
I'm so glad you like it.
It's incredible.

1347
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:02,484
Oh, man.

1348
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:04,486
And now, wait,
how's that guy Luis working out?

1349
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:06,613
Man, I had to fire him.

1350
01:12:06,698 --> 01:12:07,698
Oh, my God.

1351
01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:09,491
Yeah, he has
a drug problem.

1352
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:10,659
You're kidding!
What drug?

1353
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:11,868
No. I know... I...

1354
01:12:11,953 --> 01:12:13,036
Blow, I think.

1355
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:15,497
You're a natural, kid.

1356
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:17,499
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

1357
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:30,387
JULES: I know.
PAUL: Good.

1358
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:32,597
You're a natural.

1359
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:38,729
You can never have
too much olive oil.

1360
01:12:38,813 --> 01:12:39,813
Big no-no.

1361
01:12:43,651 --> 01:12:44,985
Oh! I forgot.

1362
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:49,948
N ic, I got a bitching 1998 Alma Rosa that
I think you're just gonna love.

1363
01:12:50,033 --> 01:12:52,534
You know what? I think I'm gonna stick
with water, but thank you so much.

1364
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:54,202
You sure?
Yeah.

is delicious.

1367

PAUL: Thank you.

1368
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,752
Really, it's...
What is the seasoning?

1369
01:13:01,836 --> 01:13:05,047
Guys, we just misted it
with a little truffle oil, right?

1370
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:06,131
Mmm-hmm.

1371
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:07,549
PAUL: It's so easy.
NIC: Wow.

1372
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:10,343
What a good idea.
We ought to try that. Right, honey?

1373
01:13:10,428 --> 01:13:11,428
Mmm-hmm.

1374
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:13,221
And it's done
to perfection.

1375
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:14,389
Yeah?
It's not too rare?

1376
01:13:14,474 --> 01:13:15,557
Oh, no, no.

1377
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:19,019
It's juicy and tender.
Exactly what rare's supposed to be.

1378
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,313
Right? I mean, I got people
coming into the restaurant,

1379
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:24,149
they see the slightest
bit of red, they just start freaking out.

1380
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,068
(SCOFFING)
Isn't that annoying?

1381
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:28,278
That happens to me
all the time when I'm grilling.

1382
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:29,529
PAUL: Hey, red is rare.

1383
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:31,156
Hello, it's bloody.

1384
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,741
I mean...
Hello?

1385
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:34,117
Yoo-hoo.
Hello, thank you.

1386
01:13:34,202 --> 01:13:37,120
Yeah, I mean, if you're in Argentina,
and you ask for rare,

1387
01:13:37,205 --> 01:13:40,332
they bring you a cow
still mooing on the plate.

I really want to go to Argentina. Buenos
Aires is supposed to be...

1390
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:47,339
Hey. I noticed
your record collection over there.

1391
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:50,092
Wow, it's quite an
eclectic mix, you know.

1392
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:51,927
Thank you very much, N ic.

1393

You're welcome.

1394

You don't meet too many straight guys
who love Joni Mitchell.

1395
01:13:55,807 --> 01:13:57,641
You sure don't.

1396
01:13:57,725 --> 01:13:59,142
You like Joni?

1397
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:03,438
No, not really. We just named our
daughter after her.

1398
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:06,608
Really?
Oh, shut the front door.

1399
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:09,945
Come on. Really? You never told me
you were named after Joni M.

1400
01:14:10,029 --> 01:14:11,613
It's so dorky.
I don't like to bring it up.

1401
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:12,823
That is so cool.

1402
01:14:12,907 --> 01:14:15,700
No, what's your
favorite Joni album? It's not cool.

1403
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:16,910
Blue.

1404
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:21,665
Right? My brother
from another mother.

1405
01:14:21,749 --> 01:14:23,708
Oh, my God.
I mean...

1406
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:28,463
Listen, I spent half of high school in my
room crying to that album.

1407
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:31,508
That record,
it kills me.

1408
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:33,176
It doesn't stop.
No.

you hurt me, baby

And I hurt you, too

1432
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:39,492
That's why we both get

1433
01:15:39,577 --> 01:15:45,248

open your heart in this world.

Don't make it any harder.

1438
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:04,100
You're right. I'm sorry.
It was a wonderful rendition.

1439

Beautiful, thank you.

Okay. Paul,
where's your bathroom?

01:16:18,616 --> 01:16:20,575
It's just right here
around the corner.

1444

really love Argentina.

wanna go there.

is literally, like,

1450
01:16:39,053 --> 01:16:42,180

cities in the world.

in the Grand Canyon.

JONI: Can we go?
I'll take you.

1454
01:17:57,923 --> 01:18:02,635
PAUL: A big rattlesnake
when I was in the desert in Baja, Mexico.

1455
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:05,263
We should.
I'll take you to Baja.

1456
01:18:05,348 --> 01:18:07,390
I was in the desert and...

1457
01:18:07,475 --> 01:18:08,683
JONI: What's it like there?

1458
01:18:08,768 --> 01:18:10,477
PAUL: It's beautiful.

1459
01:18:10,561 --> 01:18:13,855
I was surfing, but then
there was no waves,

1460
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:16,524
so we climbed up
into the mountains.

1461
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:19,861
And I hear a rattling,
and it was a rattlesnake.

1462
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:22,947
And so I was scrambling.
I didn't know what to do,

1463
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:27,327
so I reached out for a rock, and then
I threw it at the rattlesnake...

Because...

and I got dirty, and I took a shower.

No. It has nothing
to do with that!

from you lately.

anything about fault?
