00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,570
<i>On days like this,</i>

3
00:01:03,572 --> 00:01:06,740
<i>I feel like the luckiest dog
in the world.</i>

4
00:01:06,742 --> 00:01:08,709
<i>I got the sun on my back.</i>

5
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:10,878
<i>I got the wind in my face.</i>

6
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,880
<i>I get to ride in this car</i>

7
00:01:12,882 --> 00:01:15,551
<i>where the windows are
always rolled down.</i>

8
00:01:19,588 --> 00:01:22,723
<i>My name is Bailey.</i>

9
00:01:22,725 --> 00:01:24,858
You enjoying the breeze, boy?

10
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,061
- <i>I love my boy Ethan.</i>
- Boss Dog.

11
00:01:27,063 --> 00:01:29,530
<i>And I love my girl Hannah, too.</i>

12
00:01:29,532 --> 00:01:30,864
Boss Dog. Boss Man.

13
00:01:30,866 --> 00:01:32,566
<i>I've lived a lot of lives,</i>

14
00:01:32,568 --> 00:01:34,735
<i>and I've peed
on a lot of stuff.</i>

15
00:01:34,737 --> 00:01:36,303
<i>There is one thing</i>

16
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:38,672
<i>I've never been able
to figure out, though:</i>

17
00:01:38,674 --> 00:01:40,874
<i>Why does it always itch
right here?</i>

18
00:01:42,611 --> 00:01:43,877
Baby can come up.

19
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,746
Baby can come up here.

20
00:01:45,748 --> 00:01:47,681
That's my cue.

21
00:01:47,683 --> 00:01:52,052
I'll meet you in the kitchen
after I do the chores.

22
00:02:02,765 --> 00:02:05,799
You as creaky as me, Boss Dog?

23
00:02:05,801 --> 00:02:07,901
Let's go.

24
00:02:07,903 --> 00:02:10,771
- Come on.
- <i>Mornings had the best smells.</i>

25
00:02:14,944 --> 00:02:17,678
<i>Sure, we had to do
our chores...</i>

26
00:02:19,648 --> 00:02:21,782
Come on, Bailey.

27
00:02:23,786 --> 00:02:25,052
<i>...but it always ended
with an egg.</i>

28
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,057
<i>Yeah.</i>

29
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,034
Seriously?

30
00:02:44,673 --> 00:02:45,941
Hey, buddy.

31
00:02:47,977 --> 00:02:50,944
Still think you got one in you,
Boss Dog?

32
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,155
Okay.

33
00:03:07,163 --> 00:03:08,829
You ready?

34
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:10,097
<i>Born ready.</i>

35
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:11,899
One.

36
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:13,167
Two.

37
00:03:14,637 --> 00:03:15,638
Three. Go!

38
00:03:21,844 --> 00:03:23,744
Way to go, Boss Dog.

39
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:26,013
<i>Ugh, that isn't
getting any easier.</i>

40
00:03:26,015 --> 00:03:28,816
That isn't getting any easier.

41
00:03:34,857 --> 00:03:35,989
Hey.

42
00:03:35,991 --> 00:03:37,925
You still got it, Boss Dog.

43
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:39,993
Yeah. Yeah.

44
00:03:39,995 --> 00:03:41,664
Good boy.

45
00:03:42,798 --> 00:03:45,866
Come on, let's go to the house.

46
00:03:45,868 --> 00:03:48,202
Come on, buddy. Come on.

47
00:03:48,204 --> 00:03:50,003
Come on.

48
00:03:50,005 --> 00:03:52,673
<i>Come on, bacon. Come on, bacon.</i>

49
00:03:54,877 --> 00:03:57,277
<i>Eh, it's not bacon,
but I'll take it.</i>

50
00:03:59,882 --> 00:04:01,682
- Morning.
- Morning.

51
00:04:01,684 --> 00:04:03,984
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hi.

52
00:04:03,986 --> 00:04:06,019
Morning, Gloria.

53
00:04:06,021 --> 00:04:08,021
What time did she wake up,
Hannah?

54
00:04:08,023 --> 00:04:09,756
Oh, wasn't looking
at the clock.

55
00:04:09,758 --> 00:04:10,991
Doesn't matter, though.

56
00:04:10,993 --> 00:04:12,960
We're having fun
with our granddaughter.

57
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:15,129
<i>Hannah used to have
a boy named Henry.</i>

58
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:17,030
<i>He brought Gloria
into our pack.</i>

59
00:04:17,032 --> 00:04:21,168
We keep feeding her pancakes,
she's gonna get chubby.

60
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,104
<i>Maybe this time
she'll give me a treat.</i>

61
00:04:24,106 --> 00:04:26,206
<i>No? No treat? Okay.</i>

62
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:29,977
I thought little babies
were supposed to be chubby.

63
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:32,913
Ethan, shh.

64
00:04:32,915 --> 00:04:35,949
<i>Hannah made that
"shh" sound a lot lately.</i>

65
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:37,251
- Who's that?
- Daddy.

66
00:04:37,253 --> 00:04:39,987
Daddy. You know, I think
she has Henry's eyes.

67
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:42,189
<i>Henry went away
and never came back.</i>

68
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:44,291
<i>Hannah cried a lot.</i>

69
00:04:44,293 --> 00:04:46,026
<i>I licked her face a lot.</i>

70
00:04:46,028 --> 00:04:47,794
I wish my son was alive

71
00:04:47,796 --> 00:04:49,263
to see his adorable daughter.

72
00:04:49,265 --> 00:04:50,797
Aw.

73
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:51,899
Oh...

74
00:04:51,901 --> 00:04:53,967
<i>She drops it, I eat it.</i>

75
00:04:53,969 --> 00:04:55,969
- <i>That's our deal.</i>
- Oh, it fell.

76
00:04:58,274 --> 00:05:01,141
Orange. Purple.

77
00:05:01,143 --> 00:05:04,011
<i>Gloria liked
to wear food on her face.</i>

78
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:08,182
- <i>But not good food.</i>
- Hello?

79
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:11,519
A... a gross dog
just licked my face.

80
00:05:11,521 --> 00:05:12,986
No, no,
that's-that's how it goes

81
00:05:12,988 --> 00:05:14,188
when you're stuck on a farm.

82
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,523
<i>CJ, where are you going?</i>

83
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:17,525
<i>We're supposed to play here.</i>

84
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:19,326
What's happening in Chicago?

85
00:05:19,328 --> 00:05:21,030
Tell me everything.
Go away.

86
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:24,965
Are you guys going out?

87
00:05:31,974 --> 00:05:33,776
I see the horsey.

88
00:05:44,253 --> 00:05:45,553
<i>No, don't go in there.</i>

89
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:57,231
<i>CJ, stop.</i>

90
00:06:05,808 --> 00:06:07,941
He's scary.

91
00:06:10,145 --> 00:06:11,245
Whoa, boy. Whoa.

92
00:06:18,354 --> 00:06:20,153
<i>From the way he was breathing,</i>

93
00:06:20,155 --> 00:06:21,589
<i>I knew Ethan was scared.</i>

94
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:23,023
Yeah.

95
00:06:23,025 --> 00:06:24,358
I don't know. I feel like...

96
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,926
What are you doing?

97
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:27,595
Hey, let me call you back.

98
00:06:27,597 --> 00:06:30,397
CJ just got in with Linus.

99
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,266
Hey, come here.

100
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:34,201
She could have been hurt,
Gloria.

101
00:06:34,203 --> 00:06:36,604
Bailey saved her.

102
00:06:36,606 --> 00:06:38,138
Let me get this straight.

103
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,274
It's one of those hero dogs
you see on TV?

104
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:42,276
Its name is Bailey.

105
00:06:42,278 --> 00:06:45,045
<i>I love when my boy Ethan says my name.</i>

106
00:06:45,047 --> 00:06:47,116
Go inside.

107
00:06:48,317 --> 00:06:51,020
I know what you did, Boss Dog.

108
00:06:52,354 --> 00:06:54,156
Come on.

109
00:06:58,193 --> 00:07:01,194
<i>I don't know where
Gloria found this baby,</i>

110
00:07:01,196 --> 00:07:03,297
<i>but it is a great addition.</i>

111
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:05,032
CJ is smart and curious.

112
00:07:05,034 --> 00:07:07,334
We just have to keep
an eye on her.

113
00:07:07,336 --> 00:07:09,369
Well, I turned my back
for two seconds.

114
00:07:09,371 --> 00:07:11,204
More like two years.

115
00:07:11,206 --> 00:07:13,073
CJ.

116
00:07:13,075 --> 00:07:14,374
- Come on, CJ.
- No.

117
00:07:14,376 --> 00:07:17,077
- Clarity. Clarity June.
- Nana, Nana.

118
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:19,379
Hey, Mama's here now.
Can you say "Mama"?

119
00:07:19,381 --> 00:07:20,648
Nana, Nana.

120
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,916
All right.

121
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:28,955
Oh, Clarity June,
that is not funny.

122
00:07:28,957 --> 00:07:30,658
It's kind of funny.

123
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,226
<i>Why doesn't anyone
ever wipe food on my face?</i>

124
00:07:37,232 --> 00:07:40,100
<i>After all
the excitement of the day,</i>

125
00:07:40,102 --> 00:07:43,337
<i>I had to cool off
in the big water bowl.</i>

126
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:44,971
- Hey.
- You know what that is.

127
00:07:44,973 --> 00:07:46,373
You having fun yet?

128
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,241
Oh! Grand...

129
00:07:48,243 --> 00:07:50,243
Grandpa.
Oh... oh, my goodness.

130
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:52,212
I-I leave her with you
for a couple hours,

131
00:07:52,214 --> 00:07:54,414
and you have Clarity bathing
with a filthy dog?

132
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,450
<i>Finally, Gloria wants to play.</i>

133
00:07:56,452 --> 00:07:58,485
Well, they're just playing.

134
00:07:58,487 --> 00:08:00,120
All right, get-get out.
Get out, dog.

135
00:08:00,122 --> 00:08:01,188
Oh, come on.

136
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,989
They're just having fun.

137
00:08:02,991 --> 00:08:04,191
You know what?

138
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:05,526
Don't worry, honey.
Mommy's here.

139
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:06,561
Come on. It's okay.

140
00:08:06,563 --> 00:08:08,997
<i>Oh, I get what
you want me to do.</i>

141
00:08:10,933 --> 00:08:13,033
Oh!

142
00:08:14,236 --> 00:08:16,937
This is why I don't like dogs.

143
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:20,042
<i>Maybe you wanted
to stick your nose in my butt?</i>

144
00:08:22,444 --> 00:08:25,011
Gloria is just
so young to be a widow.

145
00:08:25,013 --> 00:08:28,048
Eight months pregnant when
Henry was in that car accident.

146
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,016
I know, honey. I know.

147
00:08:30,018 --> 00:08:33,521
But, Hannah,
where's her maternal instinct?

148
00:08:33,523 --> 00:08:35,523
Gloria's just trying
to figure out

149
00:08:35,525 --> 00:08:38,191
how she's gonna make a life
for herself and CJ.

150
00:08:38,193 --> 00:08:40,528
But she's got Henry's
insurance settlement.

151
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,430
Well, that money's been set
aside for CJ's college fund.

152
00:08:43,432 --> 00:08:46,433
You're the one that raised
two kids, not me.

153
00:08:46,435 --> 00:08:49,236
So, if you're not worried
about it,

154
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:51,271
I'm not worried about it.

155
00:08:51,273 --> 00:08:53,273
I'd be worried
if they weren't here.

156
00:08:53,275 --> 00:08:55,308
- Yeah.
- <i>Mm-hmm. Yeah.</i>

157
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,577
<i>Up, up, up. There we go.</i>

158
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:58,211
<i>Yeah, right in the middle.</i>

159
00:08:58,213 --> 00:09:00,280
<i>Now slide it down.
Slide it down. Yeah.</i>

160
00:09:00,282 --> 00:09:02,215
Between the three of us,
I think we can

161
00:09:02,217 --> 00:09:04,453
give that little girl
the love that she needs.

162
00:09:05,555 --> 00:09:07,022
<i>Ouch!</i>

163
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,024
- What is that?
- What?

164
00:09:11,026 --> 00:09:12,560
It's a lump.

165
00:09:12,562 --> 00:09:14,461
Big lump.

166
00:09:14,463 --> 00:09:17,330
<i>Oh, please stop poking
that spot on my belly.</i>

167
00:09:17,332 --> 00:09:19,032
I'm gonna take him to the vet.

168
00:09:19,034 --> 00:09:20,601
- Yeah.
- What's going on?

169
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:23,236
Hey, buddy. Hi, Bailey.

170
00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:28,074
<i>Somehow, Ethan always knows</i>

171
00:09:28,076 --> 00:09:30,145
<i>when I want to take a car ride.</i>

172
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:49,364
Hey, Boss Dog.

173
00:09:51,433 --> 00:09:55,235
I want you to stay put,
okay, buddy?

174
00:09:55,237 --> 00:09:58,575
Dr. Deb said we should just
keep you comfortable.

175
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:03,178
I can handle all the chores.

176
00:10:35,277 --> 00:10:38,546
<i>I had bad days,
and I had good days.</i>

177
00:10:38,548 --> 00:10:40,413
- <i>Today was a good day.</i>
- Well, me, too.

178
00:10:40,415 --> 00:10:43,684
Well, I finally got a call from
the, um... the cruise line.

179
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:46,587
<i>Gloria spent a lot
of time talking to her hand.</i>

180
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:49,557
And they needed a singer
for their Stagecoach Lounge.

181
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,458
- Doggy, doggy, doggy.
- I know.

182
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,294
<i>Um...
there's nothing in that cup.</i>

183
00:10:54,296 --> 00:10:55,563
Oh, did you make me a cup?

184
00:10:55,565 --> 00:10:57,565
- Here, Nana.
- Thank you.

185
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:59,266
Well, it's perfect
for me, right?

186
00:10:59,268 --> 00:11:01,101
Mm!

187
00:11:01,103 --> 00:11:03,303
- Delicious.
- That delicious?

188
00:11:03,305 --> 00:11:05,171
<i>Wait, there was
something in that cup?</i>

189
00:11:05,173 --> 00:11:06,607
Yeah, they went with
a singer who, uh,

190
00:11:06,609 --> 00:11:08,441
does not have a toddler.

191
00:11:08,443 --> 00:11:10,176
I don't know.

192
00:11:10,178 --> 00:11:12,312
Maybe I should come back
to Chicago.

193
00:11:12,314 --> 00:11:13,548
- More?
- Yeah, but I don't

194
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,083
really know what more I can do.

195
00:11:16,184 --> 00:11:18,586
Hey.

196
00:11:18,588 --> 00:11:21,288
- Hey.
- Hi.

197
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:28,261
Getting her to go down
for her nap took forever.

198
00:11:28,263 --> 00:11:29,630
- You know, Gloria...
- Mm-hmm?

199
00:11:29,632 --> 00:11:33,601
Um, if-if you want
to pursue your career,

200
00:11:33,603 --> 00:11:36,573
you could leave Clarity
here with us.

201
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:41,174
You think I'm a bad mother?

202
00:11:41,176 --> 00:11:42,743
What?

203
00:11:42,745 --> 00:11:46,446
Gloria... no, that's not
what I'm saying.

204
00:11:46,448 --> 00:11:48,415
Are you trying to take
my-my baby from me?

205
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,383
'Cause my baby is all I have.

206
00:11:50,385 --> 00:11:52,620
Gloria, she's making you
an incredible offer.

207
00:11:52,622 --> 00:11:54,722
I know what this is about.

208
00:11:54,724 --> 00:11:56,222
You want Henry's settlement.

209
00:11:56,224 --> 00:11:57,625
I-I-I knew you wanted
that money

210
00:11:57,627 --> 00:12:00,260
so you can fix
this crumbling farm.

211
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:01,494
This farm is not crumbling.

212
00:12:01,496 --> 00:12:02,630
<i>Ethan was mad.</i>

213
00:12:02,632 --> 00:12:05,933
<i>I hadn't heard him talk
like that in a long time.</i>

214
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:07,568
It has nothing to do
with the money.

215
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,203
It has to do with providing
a loving home for CJ.

216
00:12:10,205 --> 00:12:11,739
Well, Hannah, I am her mother.

217
00:12:11,741 --> 00:12:13,641
So, wherever I am,
that is her home.

218
00:12:13,643 --> 00:12:17,377
And okay, wow, obviously,
I'm not welcome here.

219
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:18,946
You are always welcome here.

220
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:20,514
So you can keep telling me
all the things

221
00:12:20,516 --> 00:12:21,682
I'm doing wrong
every single day?

222
00:12:21,684 --> 00:12:24,384
No, thank you. It's actually
not what I need right now.

223
00:12:24,386 --> 00:12:25,720
Well, what about CJ?
What about what she needs?

224
00:12:25,722 --> 00:12:26,687
Do you ever think about that?

225
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:28,457
Does anyone ever think
about what I need?!

226
00:12:33,395 --> 00:12:36,296
<i>There was trouble in the pack.</i>

227
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:39,265
<i>Somebody must have eaten
Gloria's food.</i>

228
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:41,267
Gloria, please don't leave.

229
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:43,604
Let's talk about this.
We can work it out.

230
00:12:43,606 --> 00:12:45,673
Whatever it takes.
Please, we can work this out.

231
00:12:45,675 --> 00:12:49,476
You don't seem to understand.
She's my baby, not yours.

232
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:52,580
Ethan, what are we gonna do?

233
00:12:52,582 --> 00:12:55,315
Gloria.

234
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:56,784
Hey, Gloria.

235
00:12:56,786 --> 00:12:58,819
<i>Such sadness from Hannah.</i>

236
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:00,688
- Nana.
- Love you.

237
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,758
<i>Sad like she was after
her boy stopped coming around.</i>

238
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,260
Listen, we want you
to have some money.

239
00:13:07,262 --> 00:13:08,796
No, thanks.

240
00:13:08,798 --> 00:13:11,364
It's for CJ.
Would you just take it?

241
00:13:14,504 --> 00:13:16,537
And let us know
where you wind up.

242
00:13:16,539 --> 00:13:19,174
It's the least you could do.

243
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,645
Gloria.

244
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,615
Bye-bye, CJ!

245
00:13:27,617 --> 00:13:29,382
Love you!

246
00:13:29,384 --> 00:13:31,351
<i>I wanted to chase the car</i>

247
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:33,353
<i>for Hannah and Ethan, but...</i>

248
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:37,625
<i>but I just didn't have
the energy.</i>

249
00:13:37,627 --> 00:13:39,595
I know.

250
00:13:49,806 --> 00:13:53,607
<i>I wanted to eat
to make Ethan happy,</i>

251
00:13:53,609 --> 00:13:55,843
<i>but I wasn't hungry anymore.</i>

252
00:13:55,845 --> 00:14:00,313
<i>It was really quiet
after CJ left.</i>

253
00:14:00,315 --> 00:14:02,750
She'll get in touch with us.

254
00:14:02,752 --> 00:14:04,484
Eventually.

255
00:14:04,486 --> 00:14:06,587
It's a little cool
out there here in Michigan,

256
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:08,488

You're my good boy.

She needs you

293
00:16:13,415 --> 00:16:15,883
You can protect her.

<i>I was in this place,

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,894
<i>Ethan gave me a new purpose.</i>

311
00:17:33,896 --> 00:17:36,830
<i>I was going to protect CJ.</i>

312
00:17:36,832 --> 00:17:41,003
<i>And I would never stop looking

313
00:17:47,576 --> 00:17:49,944
<i>I was a puppy again.</i>

314
00:17:49,946 --> 00:17:52,112
<i>I had a mother
and brothers and sisters.</i>

315
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:55,983
<i>Ugh, why are there always
seven puppies and six nipples?</i>

316
00:17:55,985 --> 00:17:57,851
Don't you worry, mama dog.

317
00:17:57,853 --> 00:17:59,687
I'm finding good homes for

318
00:17:59,689 --> 00:18:02,990
every single one
of your cuties.

319
00:18:02,992 --> 00:18:04,558
<i>But it felt like something</i>

320
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,859
<i>was missing this time.</i>

321
00:18:05,861 --> 00:18:06,994
<i>Let's see.</i>

322
00:18:06,996 --> 00:18:08,796
<i>I have ears, pretty long ones.</i>

323
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:10,831
<i>I have a tail.
I have a snout.</i>

324
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,300
<i>I wonder if I have a...</i>

325
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:16,537
<i>Nope.
I'm a girl this time.</i>

326
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:18,539
<i>It was so great
being a puppy again.</i>

327
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:21,075
<i>I got to play and play
and-and play.</i>

328
00:18:22,878 --> 00:18:25,312
<i>There was an old dog
named Mr. Churchill.</i>

329
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:26,981
<i>He was a lot of fun.</i>

330
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:31,652
They're a real handful,
eh, Mr. Churchill?

331
00:18:31,654 --> 00:18:35,589
<i>One by one, people took
my brothers and sisters away.</i>

332
00:18:35,591 --> 00:18:38,625
<i>All that was left
was my favorite brother.</i>

333
00:18:38,627 --> 00:18:42,029
<i>I was called Molly,
and he was called Rocky.</i>

334
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:53,674
<i>Then, one day,
the worst thing happened.</i>

335
00:18:53,676 --> 00:18:55,709
<i>Rocky was going away.</i>

336
00:18:55,711 --> 00:18:57,711
<i>Who was I gonna play with?</i>

337
00:18:57,713 --> 00:19:01,015
- Aw.
- You look perfect together.

338
00:19:01,017 --> 00:19:02,518
<i>Huh?</i>

339
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,652
<i>That girl.</i>

340
00:19:05,654 --> 00:19:08,956
<i>There's something
about that girl.</i>

341
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:12,659
<i>I smell something familiar.</i>

342
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:14,995
<i>It smells like...</i>

343
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:17,965
<i>CJ!</i>

344
00:19:17,967 --> 00:19:20,067
<i>I remember my purpose!
CJ is my purpose!</i>

345
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:22,169
<i>I can't let her get away.</i>

346
00:19:22,171 --> 00:19:23,804
<i>I'm coming, CJ!</i>

347
00:19:27,777 --> 00:19:29,678
<i>I can't let Ethan down.</i>

348
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,980
<i>Got to get to CJ.</i>

349
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,949
<i>I got this.</i>

350
00:19:35,951 --> 00:19:37,951
<i>I got this.
I got this. I got this.</i>

351
00:19:37,953 --> 00:19:40,020
<i>Oh, I don't got this.</i>

352
00:19:40,022 --> 00:19:42,656
I'm so happy you and Rocky
are a good match.

353
00:19:42,658 --> 00:19:44,224
He's already my best friend.

354
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,994
<i>I'm coming, CJ!</i>

355
00:19:46,996 --> 00:19:49,196
<i>Ugh, this house has
too many fences.</i>

356
00:19:49,198 --> 00:19:51,165
<i>CJ, it's me!</i>

357
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,733
<i>I-I'm here to protect you.</i>

358
00:19:54,203 --> 00:19:55,969
Whoa, psycho puppy.

359
00:19:55,971 --> 00:19:58,674
<i>CJ was a gigantic baby now.</i>

360
00:19:59,942 --> 00:20:02,876
This puppy is insane.

361
00:20:02,878 --> 00:20:04,244
That's Molly.

362
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:07,014
She and her brother
are inseparable.

363
00:20:07,016 --> 00:20:09,685
Would your family consider
adopting both of them?

364
00:20:10,753 --> 00:20:11,985
I got this.

365
00:20:20,996 --> 00:20:22,796
Think I better get out of here

366
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:25,666
before they change their minds
about getting one dog.

367
00:20:25,668 --> 00:20:27,801
<i>Mm, salt, milk.</i>

368
00:20:27,803 --> 00:20:30,003
- <i>Oh, hamburger. Mm.</i>
- How about you?

369
00:20:30,005 --> 00:20:32,239
Do you think your parents
would let you have a puppy?

370
00:20:32,241 --> 00:20:35,776
My mom does love dogs.

371
00:20:35,778 --> 00:20:36,879
She does?

372
00:20:38,047 --> 00:20:40,747
I'm gonna stop talking.

373
00:20:40,749 --> 00:20:43,717
I know what to do.
I'll take Molly home,

374
00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:47,754
my mom will go crazy for her,
and then she can call you.

375
00:20:47,756 --> 00:20:49,191
- Well...
- Well...

376
00:21:02,204 --> 00:21:03,971
- Shh.
- <i>Ah, that's the same</i>

377
00:21:03,973 --> 00:21:05,472
<i>"shh" sound Hannah always made.</i>

378
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:07,174
<i>I never know what it means.</i>

379
00:21:07,176 --> 00:21:08,976
Clarity, is that you?

380
00:21:08,978 --> 00:21:10,310
Uh, hey, Mom.

381
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:12,946
<i>That voice. It was Gloria.</i>

382
00:21:12,948 --> 00:21:15,115
Hey, did you, um...
did you move that box

383
00:21:15,117 --> 00:21:16,950
that had my demos in it?

384
00:21:16,952 --> 00:21:19,052
- Didn't touch it.
- So, I met a, um...

385
00:21:19,054 --> 00:21:23,957
this, like... a producer that
really wants to hear my music.

386
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:27,161
Got to do homework!

387
00:21:27,163 --> 00:21:28,929
- Your new home.
- <i>Okay, CJ,</i>

388
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:30,931
<i>you've got nothing to fear.</i>

389
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:33,000
<i>I'm here to protect you.
Oh, cat!</i>

390
00:21:33,002 --> 00:21:35,202
Molly, no!

391
00:21:35,204 --> 00:21:38,906
Molly! Molly!

392
00:21:38,908 --> 00:21:41,909
No, no! No!

393
00:21:41,911 --> 00:21:44,278
- <i>Great. You love playing chase, too.</i>
- No!

394
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,280
Stop!

395
00:21:46,282 --> 00:21:47,848
Not my homework!

396
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,083
No, Molly!

397
00:21:50,085 --> 00:21:52,786
Molly, no. Molly!

398
00:21:52,788 --> 00:21:54,955
No!

399
00:21:54,957 --> 00:21:56,089
No, Molly, no!

400
00:21:56,091 --> 00:21:57,958
Slow down, Molly!

401
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,860
Please. Molly.

402
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:01,995
<i>There's so much
to chew on under here.</i>

403
00:22:01,997 --> 00:22:04,031
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

404
00:22:04,033 --> 00:22:05,999
<i>That was fun.</i>

405
00:22:06,001 --> 00:22:08,268
- <i>What's the next game?</i>
- Molly.

406
00:22:09,838 --> 00:22:12,172
You're Destructo-Dog.
Yes, you are.

407
00:22:12,174 --> 00:22:14,341
<i>Oh, I love my new bed.</i>

408
00:22:14,343 --> 00:22:18,245
- <i>Where do you sleep?</i>
- Here you go, Molly.

409
00:22:18,247 --> 00:22:20,781
Hilda said you were
mostly house-trained,

410
00:22:20,783 --> 00:22:22,382
so for now,
I'll just put a towel

411
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:24,184
down here, just in case.

412
00:22:24,186 --> 00:22:26,554
<i>When you got to go,
you got to go.</i>

413
00:22:26,556 --> 00:22:28,922
No, Molly, no.

414
00:22:28,924 --> 00:22:30,891
CJ, I need to talk to you.

415
00:22:30,893 --> 00:22:32,159
Changing.

416
00:22:32,161 --> 00:22:34,228
Hello? Why's this door locked?

417
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,796
CJ.

418
00:22:35,798 --> 00:22:37,364
Hey, come on.

419
00:22:37,366 --> 00:22:39,099
Just a minute.

420
00:22:39,101 --> 00:22:41,001
<i>Yeah, don't know this game.</i>

421
00:22:41,003 --> 00:22:42,302
<i>I will give it a try.</i>

422
00:22:42,304 --> 00:22:44,938
What's... what is with
all this noise?

423
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,241
Uh, CJ, it looks like a bomb
went off in here.

424
00:22:47,243 --> 00:22:49,309
Um, I've been doing
a little rearranging.

425
00:22:49,311 --> 00:22:51,812
It smells terrible. Will you
at least open a window?

426
00:22:51,814 --> 00:22:53,213
I love your outfit.
Is it new?

427
00:22:53,215 --> 00:22:54,815
Do you love, love, love it?

428
00:22:54,817 --> 00:22:56,049
Mm, I have a date tonight.

429
00:22:56,051 --> 00:22:57,251
You're going out!

430
00:22:57,253 --> 00:22:58,986
Ow... How is he?

431
00:22:58,988 --> 00:23:00,287
Is he nice?

432
00:23:00,289 --> 00:23:03,123
Well, CJ, they always
start out nice.

433
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:06,260
Um, so can you figure out
your-your dinner tonight?

434
00:23:06,262 --> 00:23:08,128
Again?

435
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,965
Yeah.

436
00:23:15,304 --> 00:23:17,137
I think hiding you might be

437
00:23:17,139 --> 00:23:19,106
a little more difficult
than I thought.

438
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:33,420
Hey, babe. You ready?

439
00:23:33,422 --> 00:23:35,224
- Whoo!
- Let's go.

440
00:23:46,902 --> 00:23:48,101
<i>Ow.</i>

441
00:23:48,103 --> 00:23:49,303
CJ?

442
00:23:49,305 --> 00:23:51,405
- Are you ready?
- What do I say?

443
00:23:51,407 --> 00:23:53,342
Ask a question
and keep calling back.

444
00:23:56,178 --> 00:23:59,114
Don't laugh.
I need to get into character.

445
00:24:03,352 --> 00:24:06,153
- <i>Uh, where did CJ go?</i>
- Wish me luck.

446
00:24:06,155 --> 00:24:07,655
<i>Oh, hi, CJ.</i>

447
00:24:13,095 --> 00:24:15,362
Hello?

448
00:24:15,364 --> 00:24:17,364
Hello? Is this Hilda?

449
00:24:17,366 --> 00:24:19,266
This is Gloria Mitchell.

450
00:24:19,268 --> 00:24:21,335
Hello.
I've been expecting your call.

451
00:24:21,337 --> 00:24:23,170
Wonderful, wonderful.

452
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:27,374
My daughter, Clarity, brought
home that sweet dog today.

453
00:24:27,376 --> 00:24:30,377
We just adore her to pieces.

454
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:32,379
Clarity, honey,
I'm telling Hilda

455
00:24:32,381 --> 00:24:34,981
how much we love Molly.

456
00:24:34,983 --> 00:24:38,686
Oh, uh, can you hold on for a sec?

457
00:24:38,688 --> 00:24:40,120
Right on time, Trent.

458
00:24:40,122 --> 00:24:42,122
Hello? This is Trent.

459
00:24:42,124 --> 00:24:44,458
How much kibble
should I feed Rocky?

460
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,960
Half a cup.
Uh, I got to go.

461
00:24:48,297 --> 00:24:52,099
As I was saying, we'd love
to be her forever home.

462
00:24:52,101 --> 00:24:54,334
Oh, uh, can you hold on for a sec?

463
00:24:54,336 --> 00:24:55,335
Good work, Trent.

464
00:24:55,337 --> 00:24:58,138
Is that half a cup U.S.
or half a cup imperial?

465
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,473
It's just half a cup.

466
00:24:59,475 --> 00:25:01,274
Maybe I should do it by weight.

467
00:25:01,276 --> 00:25:03,009
Y-You can do it
however you want.

468
00:25:03,011 --> 00:25:05,011
Uh, I got to go.

469
00:25:05,013 --> 00:25:07,047
- I'm sorry for all of these...
- And right now,

470
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:09,182
I'm looking out
at our ginormously huge,

471
00:25:09,184 --> 00:25:12,319
grassy backyard,
and Molly and Clarity

472
00:25:12,321 --> 00:25:14,388
are rolling all around.

473
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,423
Oh, dear.
Um, can you excuse me?

474
00:25:16,425 --> 00:25:18,058
I forgot to tell you,

475
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,426
I gave Rocky a middle name.

476
00:25:19,428 --> 00:25:21,061
I'm really busy at the moment.

477
00:25:21,063 --> 00:25:22,295
Cliff. Get it?

478
00:25:22,297 --> 00:25:24,164
Rocky Cliff.
Pretty funny, right?

479
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:26,166
Can I call you later
about this?

480
00:25:26,168 --> 00:25:28,034
Don't call me too late,
because I have school tomorrow

481
00:25:28,036 --> 00:25:29,302
and I need to go to bed early.

482
00:25:30,573 --> 00:25:32,973
Sounds like
a wonderful situation.

483
00:25:32,975 --> 00:25:34,742
I'm so glad it worked out.

484
00:25:34,744 --> 00:25:38,046
Well, then I'll leave you
alone, and thank you.

485
00:25:44,453 --> 00:25:46,219
- Well?
- We did it!

486
00:25:46,221 --> 00:25:47,387
That was amazing.

487
00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:48,989
I've never done
anything bad before.

488
00:25:48,991 --> 00:25:50,056
Thank you, thank you,
thank you!

489
00:25:50,058 --> 00:25:53,193
<i>I can make noise, too!</i>

490
00:25:53,195 --> 00:25:54,562
Whoo! Let's go.
Come on, Rocky.

491
00:25:54,564 --> 00:25:56,062
High five.

492
00:25:56,064 --> 00:25:57,364
I love you, girl.

493
00:25:57,366 --> 00:25:59,199
Whoo! We did it!

494
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,490
<i>I knew my purpose
was to protect CJ,</i>

495
00:26:23,492 --> 00:26:25,225
<i>but since she was safe,</i>

496
00:26:25,227 --> 00:26:28,094
<i>I thought it was okay
to play with Rocky.</i>

497
00:26:28,096 --> 00:26:30,397
Rocky destroyed
all the slippers in the house.

498
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:32,633
My dad's doing a lot
of swearing in Mandarin.

499
00:26:32,635 --> 00:26:35,235
I had to take Molly out twice
last night.

500
00:26:35,237 --> 00:26:37,304
She still peed on my bed.

501
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:39,507
I can't believe you managed
to hide a crazy puppy

502
00:26:39,509 --> 00:26:41,241
for even one day.

503
00:26:44,213 --> 00:26:45,981
We should train them together.

504
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:49,082
You guys are going
to puppy school.

505
00:26:52,087 --> 00:26:53,453
- Rocky, come on! No!
- No, Molly, no!

506
00:26:53,455 --> 00:26:56,122
<i>Oh, why are they
walking so slow?</i>

507
00:26:56,124 --> 00:26:57,157
Rocky, slow down!

508
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:59,159
Sit. Sit.

509
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:01,294
Sit.

510
00:27:01,296 --> 00:27:04,130
Okay, then stand.

511
00:27:04,132 --> 00:27:05,633
Good dog.

512
00:27:05,635 --> 00:27:07,267
No, you have to be
the authority.

513
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:08,268
Watch and learn.

514
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,838
Lie down. Lie down.

515
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,405
- Lie down.
- <i>I'll wait till you come up</i>

516
00:27:12,407 --> 00:27:14,407
<i>with a better game.</i>

517
00:27:14,409 --> 00:27:16,443
You see? Good girl.

518
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:21,516
Stay. Wait.

519
00:27:21,518 --> 00:27:24,150
Wait. No, Rocky. Stop! Rocky!

520
00:27:24,152 --> 00:27:25,620
Paw. Paw. Come on, girl.

521
00:27:25,622 --> 00:27:27,287
Let's go, girl.

522
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:29,155
- <i>Mm, what is a paw?</i>
- Paw. Come on.

523
00:27:29,157 --> 00:27:30,525
Paw. Come on.

524
00:27:30,527 --> 00:27:32,492
- Let's go.
- <i>Maybe this is a paw?</i>

525
00:27:32,494 --> 00:27:34,529
Good girl. Good, good girl!

526
00:27:34,531 --> 00:27:37,297
<i>I can do paw!
I-I-I can do paw!</i>

527
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:41,368
It's a deal. You have graduated
puppy school right now.

528
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,670
- Rocky, come back!
- Good, good girl.

529
00:27:42,672 --> 00:27:44,607
- Rocky! Rocky!
- Good girl. Mwah.

530
00:27:56,318 --> 00:27:58,686
You can stay here
while I'm at school.

531
00:27:58,688 --> 00:28:02,188
No barking, okay?

532
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:06,594
<i>Don't really
understand what's happening.</i>

533
00:28:09,164 --> 00:28:11,666
<i>Can't wait to show this to CJ.</i>

534
00:28:11,668 --> 00:28:14,200
<i>Uh, is that
supposed to be food?</i>

535
00:28:14,202 --> 00:28:16,336
Maybe if I wasn't
going commando...

536
00:28:19,576 --> 00:28:21,609
<i>Where'd that great smell
come from?</i>

537
00:28:21,611 --> 00:28:23,209
<i>I love it.</i>

538
00:28:25,314 --> 00:28:26,479
<i>CJ?</i>

539
00:28:27,917 --> 00:28:29,517
Clarity, did you hear that?

540
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:33,353
I think it came
from the basement. I'll check.

541
00:28:33,355 --> 00:28:34,622
<i>I, uh... I'm here, CJ!</i>

542
00:28:34,624 --> 00:28:36,557
<i>You-you remembered!</i>

543
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,191
Shh.

544
00:28:38,193 --> 00:28:40,528
Molly, shh.

545
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,395
Shh.

546
00:28:42,397 --> 00:28:45,566
<i>Again with the "shh."
What does "shh" mean?</i>

547
00:28:45,568 --> 00:28:49,235
Nothing here, Mom.
I think it was next door.

548
00:28:52,174 --> 00:28:53,507
<i>Belly rub, please.</i>

549
00:28:53,509 --> 00:28:56,644
Gonna have to tell her
about you, Molly.

550
00:28:56,646 --> 00:29:00,246
Mom, there's something
I want to tell you.

551
00:29:00,248 --> 00:29:03,684
Hey, so if you, uh,
order a pizza for dinner,

552
00:29:03,686 --> 00:29:06,286
do not eat the whole thing,
okay?

553
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:08,355
Life is harder
when you're chubby.

554
00:29:08,357 --> 00:29:10,423
Plus, you claim you want
to be a singer.

555
00:29:10,425 --> 00:29:12,526
Got to look good.

556
00:29:12,528 --> 00:29:14,394
<i>It felt like CJ got hit,</i>

557
00:29:14,396 --> 00:29:16,296
<i>but I didn't see what hit her.</i>

558
00:29:16,298 --> 00:29:17,965
Mm, what'd you want to tell me?

559
00:29:17,967 --> 00:29:21,267
Just wanted to know
what time you'll be home.

560
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:23,205
Not too late.

561
00:29:28,745 --> 00:29:31,277
Mommy!

562
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,780
Mommy, I'm scared!

563
00:29:32,782 --> 00:29:34,582
<i>Wait for me, CJ!</i>

564
00:29:34,584 --> 00:29:37,283
<i>CJ was afraid.</i>

565
00:29:37,285 --> 00:29:39,285
<i>Uh, I was afraid.</i>

566
00:29:39,287 --> 00:29:43,356
<i>Maybe if I protect her,
she'll protect me.</i>

567
00:29:47,429 --> 00:29:50,731
I used to hate it
when my mom stayed out late.

568
00:29:52,602 --> 00:29:55,002
And now I have you.

569
00:29:55,004 --> 00:29:57,838
I don't have to be scared
anymore.

570
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,775
I know you'll protect me.

571
00:30:00,777 --> 00:30:03,010
<i>Make that noise stop.</i>

572
00:30:03,012 --> 00:30:05,180
<i>I'm really, really scared.</i>

573
00:30:16,726 --> 00:30:19,259
Knock, knock.

574
00:30:19,261 --> 00:30:21,261
Hey, morning, sweetie.

575
00:30:21,263 --> 00:30:22,630
Good morning.

576
00:30:22,632 --> 00:30:24,431
Um, so I thought
it might be nice

577
00:30:24,433 --> 00:30:25,700
if I cooked you some breakfast.

578
00:30:25,702 --> 00:30:28,368
What? Do you even know
how to do that?

579
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,470
You silly. Of course I do.

580
00:30:30,472 --> 00:30:32,472
<i>I need to get outside.
I need to go.</i>

581
00:30:32,474 --> 00:30:34,340
Wh-What... what is that?

582
00:30:34,342 --> 00:30:36,711
This is, um... this is...

583
00:30:36,713 --> 00:30:37,845
Hi.

584
00:30:37,847 --> 00:30:39,448
You must be Clarity.
I'm Paul.

585
00:30:40,616 --> 00:30:41,882
And who's that little fella?

586
00:30:41,884 --> 00:30:43,684
Little gal.

587
00:30:43,686 --> 00:30:45,586
- Her name's Molly.
- <i>Are we getting up?</i>

588
00:30:45,588 --> 00:30:47,521
<i>I seriously need to go.</i>

589
00:30:47,523 --> 00:30:49,289
Oh, what a sweetie.

590
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:51,458
- I love dogs.
- Oh, yeah?

591
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,626
Me and my mom do, too.

592
00:30:52,628 --> 00:30:54,762
I have to take Molly out
for a walk,

593
00:30:54,764 --> 00:30:56,496
but we'll be back
for breakfast.

594
00:30:56,498 --> 00:30:57,765
Okay.

595
00:30:57,767 --> 00:30:59,800
Um, I'll go start
those mimosas.

596
00:30:59,802 --> 00:31:01,637
Great.

597
00:31:10,513 --> 00:31:13,649
We're in trouble, Molly.
Yes, we are.

598
00:31:27,597 --> 00:31:30,097
You went behind my back
and you got a dog?

599
00:31:30,099 --> 00:31:31,632
You're not allowed
to have a dog.

600
00:31:31,634 --> 00:31:32,800
You understand me?

601
00:31:32,802 --> 00:31:34,400
<i>Gloria sounded angry.</i>

602
00:31:34,402 --> 00:31:35,703
<i>Smelled pretty strong, too.</i>

603
00:31:35,705 --> 00:31:37,905
Hey, babe,
you want another mimosa?

604
00:31:37,907 --> 00:31:40,406
Oh, yeah, that'd be lovely.

605
00:31:40,408 --> 00:31:42,408
I'm keeping her.

606
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:45,378
<i>Maybe if she plays,
she will feel happy.</i>

607
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,446
I'm keeping Molly.

608
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:48,649
I am your mother,
and I am the boss.

609
00:31:48,651 --> 00:31:50,551
And you're not supposed
to leave your 11-year-old

610
00:31:50,553 --> 00:31:52,920
alone at night,
almost every night,

611
00:31:52,922 --> 00:31:54,922
during terrifying
thunderstorms.

612
00:31:54,924 --> 00:31:57,658
I'm sure my teacher
would be very interested

613
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,827
in a mother who did that.

614
00:31:59,829 --> 00:32:01,394
Are you threatening me?

615
00:32:01,396 --> 00:32:03,764
I get scared.

616
00:32:04,934 --> 00:32:07,467
Molly protects me.

617
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:09,435
You can't make me
get rid of her.

618
00:32:09,437 --> 00:32:10,704
See?

619
00:32:10,706 --> 00:32:12,773
She's my best friend.

620
00:32:12,775 --> 00:32:14,842
And I'll do everything for her.

621
00:32:14,844 --> 00:32:17,445
You didn't even know
she was here.

622
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,820
That dog needs a bath.

623
00:32:25,822 --> 00:32:27,521
You're staying with me.

624
00:32:27,523 --> 00:32:28,823
You get to stay with me.

625
00:32:28,825 --> 00:32:30,991
<i>Good girl, CJ.
You're a good girl.</i>

626
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:33,459
Yep, you do need a bath.

627
00:32:33,461 --> 00:32:34,895
Yep. You do.

628
00:32:34,897 --> 00:32:36,864
Look, Molly, my charm bracelet.

629
00:32:36,866 --> 00:32:39,533
It has my two favorite things
in the whole world:

630
00:32:39,535 --> 00:32:40,768
you and my guitar.

631
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:43,170
<i>Thank you for
showing me whatever that is.</i>

632
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:45,172
<i>Uh, I will be going back
to sleep now.</i>

633
00:33:21,443 --> 00:33:24,511
♪ I'll be here ♪

634
00:33:24,513 --> 00:33:26,749
♪ With you ♪

635
00:33:29,685 --> 00:33:33,520

♪ The end or the start... ♪

637
00:33:36,926 --> 00:33:38,792
Hey.

638
00:33:38,794 --> 00:33:42,529
Good old Trent, always on time.

639
00:33:42,531 --> 00:33:45,032
<i>Good old Rocky,
always on time.</i>

640
00:33:45,034 --> 00:33:46,800
Hey.

641
00:33:46,802 --> 00:33:48,669
Hey.

642
00:33:48,671 --> 00:33:50,504
<i>First,
I'm gonna pull the stick,</i>

643
00:33:50,506 --> 00:33:52,940
<i>then you pull the stick,
then I'll pull the stick.</i>

644
00:33:52,942 --> 00:33:54,642
Look at our babies.

645
00:33:54,644 --> 00:33:56,810
Yep. All grown-up.

646
00:33:56,812 --> 00:33:58,812
Hey, should we start
saving for college?

647
00:33:58,814 --> 00:34:02,850
Molly and I aren't exactly
on the college track, Trent.

648
00:34:02,852 --> 00:34:05,653
I'm actually thinking about
dropping out of school.

649
00:34:05,655 --> 00:34:07,955
If I told my parents I was
dropping out of high school,

650
00:34:07,957 --> 00:34:09,790
they would
spontaneously combust.

651
00:34:11,961 --> 00:34:16,096
Yeah, well, as soon as I can,
I'm getting out of here.

652
00:34:16,098 --> 00:34:18,032
I'm gonna move
to New York City.

653
00:34:18,034 --> 00:34:19,767
And how are you gonna do that?

654
00:34:19,769 --> 00:34:24,538
There was this insurance
settlement when my dad died.

655
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,107
I finally get the money
when I'm 18, so...

656
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:29,276
I'm gonna use it to move
to New York,

657
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:32,980
make a demo and get my career
started as a musician.

658
00:34:32,982 --> 00:34:35,952
You hardly ever talk
about your dad.

659
00:34:38,988 --> 00:34:40,821
<i>I-I can tell when CJ needs me.</i>

660
00:34:40,823 --> 00:34:42,623
<i>Uh, hold on, Rocky.
I'll be right back.</i>

661
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:44,792
Hey, Molly.

662
00:34:44,794 --> 00:34:47,795
Want to sit? Come on.

663
00:34:47,797 --> 00:34:48,996
Hey.

664
00:34:48,998 --> 00:34:51,098
Yeah, well...

665
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,801
died right before
I was born, so...

666
00:34:53,803 --> 00:34:55,736
I don't really know
anything about him.

667
00:34:55,738 --> 00:34:59,106
Well, except Gloria said
his parents tried to steal

668
00:34:59,108 --> 00:35:01,942
that money from me
when I was a baby.

669
00:35:01,944 --> 00:35:03,944
So... I don't know.

670
00:35:03,946 --> 00:35:06,780
Maybe she's drunk
half the time, but...

671
00:35:06,782 --> 00:35:09,116
she did do
one good thing for me.

672
00:35:09,118 --> 00:35:11,618
<i>Sometimes
CJ squeezed me so tight,</i>

673
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,020
<i>I could barely breathe.</i>

674
00:35:13,022 --> 00:35:15,589
<i>I loved it.</i>

675
00:35:23,032 --> 00:35:25,899
Hey. Uh, are you gonna
buy something?

676
00:35:25,901 --> 00:35:28,035
'Cause if you are,
I got to go back in.

677
00:35:28,037 --> 00:35:29,737
Oh. Guess I was.

678
00:35:29,739 --> 00:35:31,907
I'm not, like, in a hurry
or anything, though.

679
00:35:34,043 --> 00:35:36,076
Let me guess.

680
00:35:36,078 --> 00:35:38,045
A bag of pretzels and a Sprite.

681
00:35:39,982 --> 00:35:42,783
Okay, I guess I'm
pretty predictable.

682
00:35:42,785 --> 00:35:44,918
Shane.

683
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,354
CJ.

684
00:35:47,356 --> 00:35:49,957
Um, that's Molly.

685
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:52,092
<i>I'm getting a bad
feeling about this person.</i>

686
00:35:52,094 --> 00:35:53,627
What's it doing?

687
00:35:53,629 --> 00:35:54,928
Getting ready to pee on me?

688
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,797
Cool it, Molly.

689
00:35:58,968 --> 00:36:00,936
Sorry.

690
00:36:02,938 --> 00:36:04,671
- So, you like motorcycles?
- Kind of.

691
00:36:04,673 --> 00:36:05,739
- Yeah?
- Cool it, Molly.

692
00:36:05,741 --> 00:36:08,142
<i>You're supposed
to throw the ball.</i>

693
00:36:09,812 --> 00:36:11,078
<i>You pick it up and throw it.</i>

694
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,747
<i>And then I get it
and you throw it again.</i>

695
00:36:13,749 --> 00:36:14,982
No, thanks, doggy.

696
00:36:14,984 --> 00:36:16,183
<i>He doesn't understand.</i>

697
00:36:16,185 --> 00:36:18,020
<i>Mm, he's not too smart.</i>

698
00:36:20,656 --> 00:36:21,822
You want this, Molly?

699
00:36:21,824 --> 00:36:23,157
You want to go get it?

700
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:24,093
Go get it.

701
00:36:26,796 --> 00:36:28,929
<i>Rocky! Trent!</i>

702
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:32,199
<i>Ooh, a quick sniff
of Rocky's butt</i>

703
00:36:32,201 --> 00:36:35,936
<i>told me everything
was going great for Rocky.</i>

704
00:36:35,938 --> 00:36:37,706
Come on, let's go.

705
00:36:39,775 --> 00:36:40,974
Hey, Trent.

706
00:36:40,976 --> 00:36:42,843
- Oh, thanks.
- Yeah.

707
00:36:42,845 --> 00:36:44,845
This is Shane.

708
00:36:44,847 --> 00:36:46,146
Oh, hey.

709
00:36:46,148 --> 00:36:48,082
Hey.

710
00:36:48,084 --> 00:36:50,851
<i>Hmm. Both of them
want to be in CJ's pack.</i>

711
00:36:50,853 --> 00:36:52,953
Hey, what's up?
Uh, you didn't return my call.

712
00:36:52,955 --> 00:36:55,956
Oh, right. Sorry.
I've... been kind of busy.

713
00:36:55,958 --> 00:36:59,059
Who is this, your mother?

714
00:36:59,061 --> 00:37:00,127
<i>They weren't
growling at each other</i>

715
00:37:00,129 --> 00:37:02,262
<i>on the outside,
but they were still growling.</i>

716
00:37:02,264 --> 00:37:03,997
Check it out.

717
00:37:03,999 --> 00:37:06,100
Talent show, next week.

718
00:37:06,102 --> 00:37:07,968
This is a chance for you

719
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:10,137
to actually perform
in front of an audience.

720
00:37:10,139 --> 00:37:12,139
Wow.

721
00:37:12,141 --> 00:37:13,841
I bet you'd be great.

722
00:37:13,843 --> 00:37:15,742
Oh, come on. You haven't
heard me sing in years.

723
00:37:15,744 --> 00:37:18,278
I know, but you have to perform
in front of people someday.

724
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,280
Plus, the winner gets $500.

725
00:37:20,282 --> 00:37:23,016
Yeah, do it, CJ.
I mean, you can sing a song

726
00:37:23,018 --> 00:37:25,018
between the magician
and the mime.

727
00:37:27,923 --> 00:37:29,756
Does look kind of lame, Trent.

728
00:37:31,093 --> 00:37:32,459
Thanks, though.

729
00:37:32,461 --> 00:37:35,229
Let's hit it.

730
00:37:35,231 --> 00:37:37,965
Maybe I'll see you later?

731
00:37:37,967 --> 00:37:39,967
<i>Wh-What about Rocky?</i>

732
00:37:39,969 --> 00:37:42,238

00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:48,275

What's gonna happen to my dog?

00:39:33,082 --> 00:39:34,948
Wait, you can't make me
leave my do...

771
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,883
- Come.
- You can't make me leave my dog.

772
00:39:36,885 --> 00:39:38,051
Molly!

<i>I didn't want to be here.</i>

777
00:39:47,997 --> 00:39:50,297

00:39:50,299 --> 00:39:52,167

779
00:40:00,976 --> 00:40:03,176
- <i>Trent!</i>
- Hey, girl.

780
00:40:03,178 --> 00:40:06,313
<i>I need to find CJ.</i>

781
00:40:06,315 --> 00:40:08,415
<i>I don't smell her.</i>

782
00:40:08,417 --> 00:40:11,051
<i>Uh, keep going.
I'll bark if I smell her.</i>

783
00:40:13,055 --> 00:40:14,622
<i>Uh, th-there she is!</i>

784
00:40:14,624 --> 00:40:16,056
<i>S-Stop! I said stop!</i>

785
00:40:19,629 --> 00:40:21,194
Molly.

786
00:40:21,196 --> 00:40:22,963
<i>CJ, I'm back!</i>

787
00:40:22,965 --> 00:40:24,632
- <i>I found you.</i>
- Hey.

788
00:40:26,935 --> 00:40:28,869
Hey.

789
00:40:28,871 --> 00:40:30,638
Thank you.

790
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,074
Thank you.

791
00:40:34,376 --> 00:40:36,977
<i>Trent got that
other guy out of the pack.</i>

792
00:40:36,979 --> 00:40:38,412
<i>I'm guessing
he finally bit him.</i>

793
00:40:38,414 --> 00:40:40,213
I was such an idiot.

794
00:40:40,215 --> 00:40:42,015
Hey, it happens.

795
00:40:43,185 --> 00:40:45,185
You never make bad choices.

796
00:40:45,187 --> 00:40:48,055
I'm too afraid of my parents.

797
00:40:48,057 --> 00:40:49,356
At least you don't have to do

798
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:51,291
a hundred hours
of community service.

799
00:40:51,293 --> 00:40:53,226
Wait, so you're gonna be
one of those people

800
00:40:53,228 --> 00:40:55,195
picking up trash
on the side of the highway?

801
00:40:55,197 --> 00:40:58,499
No, actually,
I got assigned to this program

802
00:40:58,501 --> 00:41:01,335
that trains dogs
to sniff cancer.

803
00:41:01,337 --> 00:41:03,070
- Cancer?
- Yeah.

804
00:41:03,072 --> 00:41:05,072
Sounds pretty wacky, but...

805
00:41:05,074 --> 00:41:08,010
at least I get
to take Molly with me.

806
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:14,981
So, we're a pilot program,
which is very exciting

807
00:41:14,983 --> 00:41:17,250
because we've been getting
amazing results.

808
00:41:17,252 --> 00:41:19,052
Wait, so you're telling me

809
00:41:19,054 --> 00:41:22,022
these dogs know people
have cancer before doctors do?

810
00:41:22,024 --> 00:41:24,491
We see the world.
Dogs smell it.

811
00:41:24,493 --> 00:41:27,994
Their sense of smell is
100,000 times as acute as ours.

812
00:41:27,996 --> 00:41:30,997
So, we're working on trying
to get the dogs to recognize

813
00:41:30,999 --> 00:41:34,301
the difference between cancer
samples and benign samples.

814
00:41:34,303 --> 00:41:36,136
If we successfully
scent-train a dog,

815
00:41:36,138 --> 00:41:38,506
it can make the difference
between life and death.

816
00:41:38,508 --> 00:41:41,174
Wait, so I get
to scent-train a dog?

817
00:41:41,176 --> 00:41:42,476
That's so cool.

818
00:41:42,478 --> 00:41:44,980
I love the enthusiasm,
but first...

819
00:41:49,284 --> 00:41:51,418
<i>I hope this isn't CJ's purpose.</i>

820
00:42:00,129 --> 00:42:01,962
<i>We went every day.</i>

821
00:42:01,964 --> 00:42:04,131
<i>CJ was happy,
and that made me happy.</i>

822
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:13,306
<i>Why is he getting treats?</i>

823
00:42:13,308 --> 00:42:15,344
<i>I want treats, too.</i>

824
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:22,583
- Good dog, Bode.
- <i>Okay.</i>

825
00:42:22,585 --> 00:42:25,185
<i>If Bode gets one more treat
and I get nothing,</i>

826
00:42:25,187 --> 00:42:28,056
<i>I'm gonna go nuts.</i>

827
00:42:29,258 --> 00:42:32,194
Good boy. Good boy, Bode.

828
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:40,066
<i>Mm, that smell.</i>

829
00:42:40,068 --> 00:42:42,335
<i>Is that why Bode gets treats?</i>

830
00:42:42,337 --> 00:42:44,440
<i>Maybe if I...</i>

831
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:50,345
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

832
00:42:52,114 --> 00:42:53,447
Good girl.

833
00:42:53,449 --> 00:42:54,414
<i>That's it.</i>

834
00:42:54,416 --> 00:42:57,585
<i>If you smell the smell,
you get a treat.</i>

835
00:42:57,587 --> 00:43:01,087
CJ, do you mind if I start
training Molly, too?

836
00:43:02,592 --> 00:43:05,961
Good girl, Molly.

Hi, Gloria.

843
00:43:28,417 --> 00:43:30,183
It's good to see you.

- This is a surprise.
- Gloria.

850
00:43:43,198 --> 00:43:46,333
We sent a note saying
we're going to be in the area

851
00:43:46,335 --> 00:43:48,569
and we hoped it'd be okay
to stop by.

852
00:43:48,571 --> 00:43:49,670
Did you? Okay.

853
00:43:49,672 --> 00:43:51,404
Must have missed that.

854
00:43:51,406 --> 00:43:52,472
<i>Look, Ethan, look!</i>

855
00:43:52,474 --> 00:43:55,075
We were cleaning out the barn,
and we found a...

856
00:43:55,077 --> 00:43:56,409
a-a lot of Henry's things.

857
00:43:56,411 --> 00:43:57,845
- We thought that...
- Yes.

858
00:43:57,847 --> 00:44:00,480

might like to see it.

00:44:00,482 --> 00:44:02,617
<i>Is anyone seeing
what I'm doing here?</i>

860
00:44:02,619 --> 00:44:04,451
Yeah, you could have sent
whatever that is.

861
00:44:04,453 --> 00:44:06,186
Well, we wanted to see you.

862
00:44:06,188 --> 00:44:08,288
We want to see CJ.

863
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:10,190
Well, we don't want
to see you, which is why...

864
00:44:10,192 --> 00:44:12,125
<i>Ethan, it's me, Bailey!</i>

865
00:44:12,127 --> 00:44:13,426
<i>Can't you tell it's me?</i>

866
00:44:13,428 --> 00:44:15,295
Is that you, Boss Dog?

867
00:44:15,297 --> 00:44:17,598
<i>It's me, it's me, it's me!</i>

868
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,301
Quiet!

869
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:23,336
Gloria, we just want to see CJ.

870
00:44:23,338 --> 00:44:26,139
What makes you think
you can just show up like this?

871
00:44:26,141 --> 00:44:28,308
Okay, I-I-I'm not
a little kid anymore,

872
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:30,578
so you can't...
you can't push me around.

873
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,112
We want to see
our granddaughter,

874
00:44:32,114 --> 00:44:33,446
just to see how she's doing.

875
00:44:33,448 --> 00:44:34,615
<i>Ooh, I'll go
tell CJ you're here.</i>

876
00:44:34,617 --> 00:44:36,884
Well, she doesn't want
to see you.

877
00:44:36,886 --> 00:44:39,219
- Is she home?
- That is none of your business!

878
00:44:39,221 --> 00:44:40,655
<i>You're not gonna believe it.</i>

879
00:44:40,657 --> 00:44:42,557
<i>Ethan and Hannah are here,</i>

880
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:44,124
<i>and they smell
better than ever.</i>

881
00:44:44,126 --> 00:44:45,425
- <i>Come! Come now!</i>
- Hey. What you doing?

882
00:44:45,427 --> 00:44:47,227
<i>Let's go. Follow me.</i>

883
00:44:47,229 --> 00:44:50,363
We have a whole life without you.

884
00:44:50,365 --> 00:44:52,500
- I really don't appreciate this ambush.
- "Ambush"?

885
00:44:52,502 --> 00:44:55,201
Oh, oh, Gloria, we're family.

886
00:44:55,203 --> 00:44:56,571
Gloria.

887
00:44:56,573 --> 00:44:58,271
Can't we just start again?
Please.

888
00:44:58,273 --> 00:44:59,607
- Let's just start over.
- Glo...

889
00:44:59,609 --> 00:45:02,077
Gloria, Gloria, please.

890
00:45:06,716 --> 00:45:08,348
<i>Y-You forgot
Ethan and Hannah.</i>

891
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:10,183
Don't look at me like that.

892
00:45:10,185 --> 00:45:12,385
All these years later, they
still want to take her from me.

893
00:45:15,257 --> 00:45:16,624
<i>Gloria!</i>

894
00:45:16,626 --> 00:45:19,560
<i>L-Let them in.
It's Ethan and Hannah.</i>

895
00:45:19,562 --> 00:45:21,762
I'll just leave it here.

896
00:45:27,235 --> 00:45:29,770
I know that's you, Boss Dog.

897
00:45:29,772 --> 00:45:32,238
<i>I love it when he
calls me "Boss Dog."</i>

898
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,641
You just keep looking after CJ.

899
00:45:33,643 --> 00:45:35,511
Okay.

900
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:42,950
<i>No, don't leave!</i>

901
00:45:42,952 --> 00:45:45,120
<i>CJ's here.</i>

902
00:45:47,657 --> 00:45:49,525
Come on, Molly. Come on.

903
00:45:50,693 --> 00:45:53,694
Okay.

904
00:45:53,696 --> 00:45:56,296
Good job, Molly.

905
00:45:56,298 --> 00:45:58,532
Andi says you've really taken
to scent training.

906
00:45:58,534 --> 00:45:59,533
<i>Food, please.</i>

907
00:45:59,535 --> 00:46:01,267
Yo.

908
00:46:01,269 --> 00:46:02,503
<i>Leave us alone.</i>

909
00:46:02,505 --> 00:46:04,672
What are you doing here?

910
00:46:04,674 --> 00:46:06,272
You don't answer my calls.

911
00:46:06,274 --> 00:46:07,608
Yeah, because I don't want
to talk to you, Shane.

912
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:10,243
Come on, CJ. You're not still
mad about the party?

913
00:46:10,245 --> 00:46:12,345
Don't walk away from me.

914
00:46:12,347 --> 00:46:13,446
Whoa, get off. Shane!

915
00:46:13,448 --> 00:46:14,447
What are you doing?

916
00:46:14,449 --> 00:46:16,383
- I thought you were cooler than this.
- Shane!

917
00:46:16,385 --> 00:46:18,786
Aah! It bit me!

918
00:46:18,788 --> 00:46:21,221
<i>Go away. CJ doesn't like you.</i>

919
00:46:21,223 --> 00:46:23,423
I'm gonna kill that stupid dog!

920
00:46:24,594 --> 00:46:26,729
<i>I don't like you, either.</i>

921
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,699
Richard, if that's you,

922
00:46:31,701 --> 00:46:34,300
why don't you come get
your junk?

923
00:46:34,302 --> 00:46:36,003
Oh, it's you.

924
00:46:36,005 --> 00:46:38,340
Richard left.

925
00:46:39,709 --> 00:46:42,375
Shane just attacked me.

926
00:46:48,584 --> 00:46:52,720
<i>Gloria smelled
stronger than usual.</i>

927
00:46:52,722 --> 00:46:54,722
Well...

928
00:46:54,724 --> 00:46:57,625
looks like today's not
a good day for us and men.

929
00:47:00,596 --> 00:47:02,395
Right.

930
00:47:02,397 --> 00:47:04,332
You're drunk.

931
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:09,469
Yeah.

932
00:47:09,471 --> 00:47:11,706
Adults are allowed to get drunk

933
00:47:11,708 --> 00:47:14,508
when they get dumped
by their boyfriend

934
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:17,511
who borrowed money
they will never see again.

935
00:47:17,513 --> 00:47:19,680
I just told you that some guy
attacked me, Mom.

936
00:47:19,682 --> 00:47:22,516
It was really scary.
Do you even care?

937
00:47:22,518 --> 00:47:25,519
Well, what did you do?
Did you... did you lead him on?

938
00:47:25,521 --> 00:47:28,356
Did you provoke him
or something?

939
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,530
I cannot believe
you just said that.

940
00:47:36,498 --> 00:47:38,699
You are literally
the worst mother in the world.

941
00:47:38,701 --> 00:47:40,603
No, that was my mother.

942
00:47:46,441 --> 00:47:47,742
I'm leaving.

943
00:47:47,744 --> 00:47:49,643
I don't want to be here
anymore.

944
00:47:49,645 --> 00:47:52,713
I'm taking my money,
and I'm moving out.

945
00:47:52,715 --> 00:47:54,648
- Ooh, what money?
- The money from Dad's settlement.

946
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:56,652
Oh, Clarity, that money's gone.

947
00:47:58,855 --> 00:48:00,621
What?

948
00:48:00,623 --> 00:48:04,792
How do you think
we have a house?

949
00:48:04,794 --> 00:48:07,429
And a car?

950
00:48:09,632 --> 00:48:12,432
But... but that money
was for me.

951
00:48:12,434 --> 00:48:13,801
Well, it's been for you, CJ!

952
00:48:13,803 --> 00:48:15,603
I am alone.

953
00:48:15,605 --> 00:48:18,404
How do you expect me to do...
to do this on my own?

954
00:48:18,406 --> 00:48:20,674
W-Wait.

955
00:48:20,676 --> 00:48:22,943
So, all of the...

956
00:48:22,945 --> 00:48:25,546
all of the travel, Mom,

957
00:48:25,548 --> 00:48:28,916
the-the closet
full of designer clothes,

958
00:48:28,918 --> 00:48:32,887
the cases of wine...

959
00:48:32,889 --> 00:48:36,324
that... that's all been
my inheritance?

960
00:48:37,693 --> 00:48:40,563
I deserve nice things, too.

961
00:48:42,532 --> 00:48:45,733
Mom, that money
was the only thing

962
00:48:45,735 --> 00:48:47,703
I ever got from my dad.

963
00:48:51,808 --> 00:48:55,943
That was the only thing
that made me feel like,

964
00:48:55,945 --> 00:48:58,746
somewhere in the world,
there might actually be

965
00:48:58,748 --> 00:49:00,616
someone looking out for me.

966
00:49:02,384 --> 00:49:04,518
But I guess that was
really stupid, wasn't it?

967
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,153
You cannot take the car.

968
00:49:06,155 --> 00:49:08,423
Why not? I paid for it.

969
00:49:23,706 --> 00:49:25,172
<i>I never knew there could be</i>

970
00:49:25,174 --> 00:49:27,342
<i>such a thing as a sad car ride.</i>

971
00:49:32,882 --> 00:49:34,482
What?

972
00:49:35,751 --> 00:49:36,786
Shane?

973
00:49:38,855 --> 00:49:40,890
Ugh, leave me alone.

974
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,774
What are you doing?

975
00:50:02,712 --> 00:50:04,645
<i>All I wanted to do was stay</i>

976
00:50:04,647 --> 00:50:06,580
<i>on my seat, but the car
kept pushing me off.</i>

977
00:50:06,582 --> 00:50:07,516
Sorry, Molly.

978
00:50:11,821 --> 00:50:13,623
Oh, God.

979
00:50:16,893 --> 00:50:18,491
What?

980
00:50:21,864 --> 00:50:23,463
<i>The car's gone crazy.</i>

981
00:50:57,867 --> 00:50:59,533
Molly?

982
00:50:59,535 --> 00:51:02,703
<i>The car finally stopped.</i>

983
00:51:02,705 --> 00:51:04,738
<i>Are you okay, CJ?</i>

984
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:07,977
Molly? Molly?

985
00:51:12,581 --> 00:51:14,815
<i>Oh, I love that sound.</i>

986
00:51:14,817 --> 00:51:16,784
<i>It means CJ's nearby.</i>

987
00:51:16,786 --> 00:51:19,922
Molly. Molly?

988
00:51:21,824 --> 00:51:22,990
Molly?

989
00:51:22,992 --> 00:51:25,559
<i>But now I know I'm leaving her.</i>

990
00:51:25,561 --> 00:51:27,628
- <i>I don't want to.</i>
- Molly.

991
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:28,963
<i>But I have no choice.</i>

992
00:51:28,965 --> 00:51:30,700
Molly.

993
00:51:32,001 --> 00:51:33,968
Molly.

994
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:37,538
- No, Molly.
- <i>I remembered baby CJ on the farm</i>

995
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:40,607
<i>and how much I wanted
to protect her.</i>

996
00:51:40,609 --> 00:51:43,844
<i>How much she needed me.</i>

997
00:51:43,846 --> 00:51:45,846
<i>Her journey...</i>

998
00:51:45,848 --> 00:51:47,848
<i>is not over.</i>

999
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,096
Come on.

1000
00:52:02,064 --> 00:52:04,765
<i>CJ was so sad.</i>

1001
00:52:04,767 --> 00:52:06,502
<i>She still needs me.</i>

1002
00:52:08,637 --> 00:52:12,039
<i>CJ, wherever you are,
I promise...</i>

1003
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:14,043
<i>I'll find you.</i>

1004
00:52:19,749 --> 00:52:22,783
<i>But first, I need to get
a few things out of the way.</i>

1005
00:52:22,785 --> 00:52:24,918
<i>I need to play.
I need to wrestle.</i>

1006
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,787
<i>I need to bite a few faces.</i>

1007
00:52:26,789 --> 00:52:27,788
<i>I need to bark.</i>

1008
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:28,989
<i>I need to play with a blanket.</i>

1009
00:52:28,991 --> 00:52:31,527
<i>I need to bite some ears.</i>

1010
00:52:33,796 --> 00:52:36,797
<i>And, unfortunately,
I still have to take baths.</i>

1011
00:52:45,041 --> 00:52:48,108
<i>I knew my journey
was with CJ, but...</i>

1012
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:50,077
<i>I couldn't find her scent
anywhere.</i>

1013
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:51,879
Come on, Big Dog.

1014
00:52:51,881 --> 00:52:53,714
- Yeah.
- <i>Now I lived with Joe.</i>

1015
00:52:53,716 --> 00:52:56,183
- Ready for another day?
- <i>He was good to me.</i>

1016
00:52:56,185 --> 00:52:59,086
<i>He lived in a house
made out of snacks.</i>

1017
00:52:59,088 --> 00:53:01,622
Just for you.

1018
00:53:01,624 --> 00:53:04,925
Okay, bon appétit.

1019
00:53:06,729 --> 00:53:09,165
<i>Ah, these are my favorite.</i>

1020
00:53:13,135 --> 00:53:15,169
- Enjoy it.
- <i>I forgot about these.</i>

1021
00:53:15,171 --> 00:53:17,106
<i>No, these are definitely
my favorite.</i>

1022
00:53:18,674 --> 00:53:20,707
Oh, no ice cream for you.

1023
00:53:20,709 --> 00:53:22,176
How about a Slim Jim? Huh?

1024
00:53:22,178 --> 00:53:23,644
- <i>That's the one.</i>
- Yeah.

1025
00:53:23,646 --> 00:53:24,711
<i>We have a winner.</i>

1026
00:53:24,713 --> 00:53:25,846
<i>My favorite.</i>

1027
00:53:35,024 --> 00:53:36,990
<i>Then, one day,</i>

1028
00:53:36,992 --> 00:53:39,793
<i>I heard something
that reminded me of...</i>

1029
00:53:39,795 --> 00:53:41,730
<i>Huh?</i>

1030
00:53:45,101 --> 00:53:47,103
<i>That sound.</i>

1031
00:53:48,804 --> 00:53:50,070
Morning.

1032
00:53:50,072 --> 00:53:52,973
Hi.

1033
00:53:54,143 --> 00:53:55,744
<i>Huh?</i>

1034
00:53:59,115 --> 00:54:01,016
<i>Could it be?</i>

1035
00:54:03,018 --> 00:54:06,987
<i>Maybe one more sniff,
just to be sure.</i>

1036
00:54:06,989 --> 00:54:08,155
How's your day going?

1037
00:54:08,157 --> 00:54:09,690
Um, pretty good, thanks.

1038
00:54:09,692 --> 00:54:10,791
That'll be $4.50.

1039
00:54:10,793 --> 00:54:11,959
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

1040
00:54:11,961 --> 00:54:14,161
<i>It's my CJ. I found you!</i>

1041
00:54:14,163 --> 00:54:16,163
Big Dog.

1042
00:54:16,165 --> 00:54:18,198
He never gets up for anything.

1043
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,968
"Big Dog"? How'd you ever
come up with that name?

1044
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:23,036
Just sort of came to me.

1045
00:54:23,038 --> 00:54:25,105
Hey there, Big Dog. Hey.

1046
00:54:25,107 --> 00:54:27,107
- <i>Now I can go with you.</i>
- How you doing?

1047
00:54:27,109 --> 00:54:28,475
<i>Where are we going?</i>

1048
00:54:28,477 --> 00:54:29,877
Must smell a dog on you.

1049
00:54:29,879 --> 00:54:31,745
Oh, I don't have a dog.

1050
00:54:31,747 --> 00:54:33,147
Used to, though.

1051
00:54:33,149 --> 00:54:36,049
Her name was Molly.
She was the best.

1052
00:54:36,051 --> 00:54:38,654
<i>Oh, she knows it's me.
We're finally back together.</i>

1053
00:54:40,823 --> 00:54:42,856
- Oh.
- Oh, paw.

1054
00:54:42,858 --> 00:54:44,791
That is so sweet.

1055
00:54:44,793 --> 00:54:47,494
I, um...
I trained my dog to shake.

1056
00:54:47,496 --> 00:54:49,930
He's never done that before.

1057
00:54:49,932 --> 00:54:52,166
Really? Huh.

1058
00:54:52,168 --> 00:54:55,936
Well, it's very nice
to meet you, Big Dog.

1059
00:54:55,938 --> 00:54:58,805
Um, oh, can I also get
a lottery scratch card?

1060
00:54:58,807 --> 00:54:59,940
Mm-hmm.

1061
00:54:59,942 --> 00:55:01,208
So, where you headed?

1062
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:02,809
Uh, New York City.

1063
00:55:02,811 --> 00:55:04,044
<i>I hope Joe tells her about</i>

1064
00:55:04,046 --> 00:55:05,179
<i>how much I love meat sticks.</i>

1065
00:55:05,181 --> 00:55:07,214
Oh, you got a job or something?

1066
00:55:07,216 --> 00:55:09,082
Well, I'm a singer-songwriter.

1067
00:55:09,084 --> 00:55:12,219
Trying to be
a singer-songwriter, so...

1068
00:55:12,221 --> 00:55:14,821
- Oh, no way. 50 bucks.
- Ah.

1069
00:55:14,823 --> 00:55:17,090
- Congratulations.
- Wow.

1070
00:55:17,092 --> 00:55:19,159
Never won anything before
in my life.

1071
00:55:19,161 --> 00:55:21,028
You must be a lucky dog.

1072
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:22,829
<i>And I hope Joe tells her about</i>

1073
00:55:22,831 --> 00:55:24,532
<i>the crunchy, salty things, too.
Oh, they're so good.</i>

1074
00:55:24,534 --> 00:55:26,099
Thank you.

1075
00:55:26,101 --> 00:55:28,268
Okay. See ya.

1076
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:30,971
- Travel safe.
- <i>I wished I could thank Joe for taking</i>

1077
00:55:30,973 --> 00:55:32,206
<i>such good care of me
all this time.</i>

1078
00:55:32,208 --> 00:55:33,840
<i>I hoped he knew
how grateful I was.</i>

1079
00:55:33,842 --> 00:55:36,243
Oh, no, no.
You have to stay here, Big Dog.

1080
00:55:36,245 --> 00:55:38,981
<i>CJ, no. I'm supposed to come with you.</i>

1081
00:55:52,995 --> 00:55:55,030
<i>CJ, wait. What are you doing?</i>

1082
00:55:57,967 --> 00:55:59,066
<i>No! No, you can't leave me.</i>

1083
00:55:59,068 --> 00:56:01,201
<i>I told Ethan I would protect you.</i>

1084
00:56:01,203 --> 00:56:02,369
Big Dog.

1085
00:56:02,371 --> 00:56:03,937
<i>CJ, come back.</i>

1086
00:56:03,939 --> 00:56:05,872
<i>I need to help you.</i>

1087
00:56:05,874 --> 00:56:07,407
Big Dog!

1088
00:56:07,409 --> 00:56:09,876
<i>Please, take me with you.</i>

1089
00:56:11,947 --> 00:56:13,581
<i>No! No!
I can't lose you.</i>

1090
00:56:13,583 --> 00:56:16,852
<i>I will never stop.
I will never stop.</i>

1091
00:56:18,588 --> 00:56:21,021
<i>Slow... slow down.</i>

1092
00:56:21,023 --> 00:56:24,157
<i>I'm sorry, I...
I just can't run any faster.</i>

1093
00:56:29,231 --> 00:56:31,298
Come on, Big Dog.

1094
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:34,134
Big Dog.

1095
00:56:34,136 --> 00:56:37,170
Come on. Come on.

1096
00:56:37,172 --> 00:56:39,906
<i>I will never stop.</i>

1097
00:56:39,908 --> 00:56:42,311
<i>I will never stop
looking for you.</i>

1098
00:56:58,027 --> 00:57:01,964
<i>Day after day passed,
but no CJ.</i>

1099
00:57:04,033 --> 00:57:07,301
<i>I don't know why
she left me behind.</i>

1100
00:57:10,205 --> 00:57:12,906
<i>I waited so long.</i>

1101
00:57:12,908 --> 00:57:16,343
<i>I got older and older.</i>

1102
00:57:16,345 --> 00:57:20,215
<i>And when it was time, I knew.</i>

1103
00:57:31,927 --> 00:57:36,865
<i>I guess I wasn't gonna be
with CJ in this life.</i>

1104
00:57:47,476 --> 00:57:50,243
<i>I had a good life with Joe.</i>

1105
00:57:50,245 --> 00:57:53,382
<i>But it was really hard knowing
CJ was out there without me.</i>

1106
00:57:55,685 --> 00:57:58,854
<i>I knew our journey wasn't over.</i>

1107
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,960
<i>I came back small,</i>

1108
00:58:06,962 --> 00:58:08,995
<i>but I was not gonna
let that stop me.</i>

1109
00:58:08,997 --> 00:58:11,398
<i>I've been born
enough times now to know</i>

1110
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:15,202
<i>that when you're hungry,
you have got to fight for it.</i>

1111
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:20,374
<i>So, apparently,
my growing phase was over.</i>

1112
00:58:20,376 --> 00:58:22,175
<i>I was gonna remain small.</i>

1113
00:58:22,177 --> 00:58:24,144
<i>Cat-sized.</i>

1114
00:58:24,146 --> 00:58:27,147
<i>If I was gonna find CJ,</i>

1115
00:58:27,149 --> 00:58:30,317
<i>I was gonna need
a new strategy.</i>

1116
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:33,086
Look at you.
You are so cute.

1117
00:58:33,088 --> 00:58:35,155
<i>Hey! I already belong to somebody.</i>

1118
00:58:36,458 --> 00:58:38,959
We're really looking
for an older dog.

1119
00:58:38,961 --> 00:58:40,561
I have the perfect dog for you.

1120
00:58:40,563 --> 00:58:41,696
Mm.

1121
00:58:41,698 --> 00:58:44,030
<i>Sorry about that.
Nothing personal.</i>

1122
00:58:44,032 --> 00:58:45,566
Aw, how sweet.

1123
00:58:45,568 --> 00:58:48,135
This little cutie
would fit in my purse.

1124
00:58:48,137 --> 00:58:49,537
<i>Nope.</i>

1125
00:58:49,539 --> 00:58:51,173
<i>Keep moving.</i>

1126
00:58:53,108 --> 00:58:56,042
<i>Good going, old guy.</i>

1127
00:58:56,044 --> 00:58:58,178
<i>Oh, she's gonna be tricky.</i>

1128
00:58:59,516 --> 00:59:02,149
<i>Wait. Wait.</i>

1129
00:59:02,151 --> 00:59:04,519
<i>I know that sound.</i>

1130
00:59:04,521 --> 00:59:06,054
<i>Could it be?</i>

1131
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:10,025
<i>I think it might be.</i>

1132
00:59:11,493 --> 00:59:13,460
<i>What if it is?</i>

1133
00:59:13,462 --> 00:59:15,295
I'm sorry, Max, but I'm gonna

1134
00:59:15,297 --> 00:59:17,130
have to take you back
to the shelter.

1135
00:59:17,132 --> 00:59:19,332
<i>I have to find out.</i>

1136
00:59:19,334 --> 00:59:22,235
<i>I don't want to have
to do this, but...</i>

1137
00:59:22,237 --> 00:59:24,572
- Ow! Oh, oh! Max!
- <i>Sorry. You've been great.</i>

1138
00:59:24,574 --> 00:59:27,075
- <i>Thanks for all the food and water.</i>
- Max, Max!

1139
00:59:37,486 --> 00:59:39,419
<i>Whoa. This place is huge.</i>

1140
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:46,359
<i>Out of my way.
Dog coming through.</i>

1141
00:59:46,361 --> 00:59:48,028
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

1142
01:00:00,476 --> 01:00:03,578
<i>Being small does have
some advantages.</i>

1143
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:06,112
<i>Wow, that smells good.
Maybe just one lick.</i>

1144
01:00:06,114 --> 01:00:07,314
<i>No, forget that.</i>

1145
01:00:07,316 --> 01:00:09,416
<i>I cannot let her get away this time.</i>

1146
01:00:09,418 --> 01:00:10,651
<i>I can't see a thing.</i>

1147
01:00:10,653 --> 01:00:12,419
<i>I need to get to higher ground.</i>

1148
01:00:12,421 --> 01:00:14,622
...Square
Park is a 9.7-acre park...

1149
01:00:14,624 --> 01:00:16,557
<i>Oh, yeah! There she is!</i>

1150
01:00:24,333 --> 01:00:26,066
Afternoon.

1151
01:00:26,068 --> 01:00:27,234
<i>My legs are short but fast.</i>

1152
01:00:27,236 --> 01:00:28,268
<i>I'm not gonna lose you
this time.</i>

1153
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,340
Hey.

1154
01:00:33,342 --> 01:00:36,142
<i>CJ. My CJ.</i>

1155
01:00:36,144 --> 01:00:37,177
<i>I found you.</i>

1156
01:00:37,179 --> 01:00:38,278
Oh, hello.

1157
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,446
What you doing?

1158
01:00:44,152 --> 01:00:45,418
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Come here.

1159
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:47,256
Ugh, how do you get
this thing off?

1160
01:00:53,161 --> 01:00:54,562
<i>Here I am.</i>

1161
01:00:54,564 --> 01:00:55,565
<i>Here to protect you.</i>

1162
01:00:57,165 --> 01:00:59,399
<i>Still delicious.</i>

1163
01:00:59,401 --> 01:01:01,336
Where did you come from?

1164
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,507
Ah, thank you.

1165
01:01:06,509 --> 01:01:08,341
- Hey.
- Oh. -

1166
01:01:08,343 --> 01:01:10,878
Think there was a jailbreak.

1167
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,245
Is that Max?

1168
01:01:12,247 --> 01:01:13,514
Oh, Max.

1169
01:01:13,516 --> 01:01:15,248
You are such a love dog, Max.

1170
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:16,584
You're the only person
in the world

1171
01:01:16,586 --> 01:01:17,885
he hasn't tried to bite.

1172
01:01:17,887 --> 01:01:20,220
It's like he chose you.

1173
01:01:20,222 --> 01:01:22,289
I can't.
I-I live with my boyfriend,

1174
01:01:22,291 --> 01:01:24,291
and he already has a dog.
I...

1175
01:01:24,293 --> 01:01:27,127
I really can't bring home
another one.

1176
01:01:27,129 --> 01:01:28,529
That's too bad.

1177
01:01:28,531 --> 01:01:30,598
He's scheduled
to be put down tomorrow.

1178
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,599
Wait, are you serious?

1179
01:01:31,601 --> 01:01:33,466
W-We do our best to foster out

1180
01:01:33,468 --> 01:01:35,536
to no-kill shelters,
but they're full.

1181
01:01:35,538 --> 01:01:37,203
We're full.

1182
01:01:37,205 --> 01:01:39,507
Max is taking a place
that could go to another dog.

1183
01:01:39,509 --> 01:01:41,509
- Oh, but you can't...
- Rescue's like a river.

1184
01:01:41,511 --> 01:01:43,478
It has to keep flowing,
or it backs up.

1185
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:53,921
Duke?

1186
01:01:53,923 --> 01:01:55,658
Ah-ah-ah-ah. Sit.

1187
01:01:57,627 --> 01:01:59,094
Okay.

1188
01:02:00,495 --> 01:02:03,229
Sit, Max.

1189
01:02:03,231 --> 01:02:05,566
<i>Yeah.
You sit, and you stay that way.</i>

1190
01:02:05,568 --> 01:02:06,703
<i>Get me?</i>

1191
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:09,704
This is Max.

1192
01:02:09,706 --> 01:02:12,405
You two are gonna be
very good friends.

I know, I know.
I missed you, too.

1206
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:42,435
- Hey.
- Hey.

1207
01:02:42,437 --> 01:02:43,804
- How was your trip?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1208

Good. Yeah.

1210
01:02:47,342 --> 01:02:50,410
So, that's the dog
you told me about.

1211
01:02:50,412 --> 01:02:51,579
Yep.

1212
01:02:51,581 --> 01:02:52,613
<i>Keep your distance.</i>

1213
01:02:52,615 --> 01:02:53,714
<i>I'm protecting CJ now.</i>

1214
01:02:53,716 --> 01:02:55,348
Great personality.

1215
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:56,784
He just needs a minute
to warm up.

1216
01:02:56,786 --> 01:02:59,553
And Duke loves
having a playmate.

1217
01:02:59,555 --> 01:03:01,589
And I guess playing your music
for two dogs is

1218
01:03:01,591 --> 01:03:03,390
better than one dog, right?

1219
01:03:03,392 --> 01:03:05,559
Right.
They're a good audience.

1220
01:03:05,561 --> 01:03:07,728
Too bad dogs don't buy records.

1221
01:03:07,730 --> 01:03:10,700
Look, I'm gonna play for people
when I'm ready. All right?

1222
01:03:18,708 --> 01:03:22,308
<i>Every day,
CJ walked a huge group of dogs.</i>

1223
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:24,310
<i>They knew I was in charge.</i>

1224
01:03:27,784 --> 01:03:30,584
- Hey.
- Hey.

1225
01:03:30,586 --> 01:03:33,654
- Whoa.
- Uh, so Ringo had a great time.

01:03:33,656 --> 01:03:35,756
- He, um, peed twice.
- Oh, great.

1227
01:03:35,758 --> 01:03:37,290
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1228
01:03:37,292 --> 01:03:38,695
- See ya.
- Bye.

1229
01:03:42,665 --> 01:03:45,465
<i>This box has smells like, uh...</i>

1230
01:03:45,467 --> 01:03:46,534
Max, where are you going?

1231
01:03:46,536 --> 01:03:47,702
Hey!

1232
01:03:47,704 --> 01:03:49,335
Sorry.

1233
01:03:49,337 --> 01:03:51,337
- <i>Uh, this way!</i>
- Max!

1234
01:03:51,339 --> 01:03:54,340
Max, come back.

1235
01:03:54,342 --> 01:03:55,377
Max.

1236
01:04:01,349 --> 01:04:02,552
Max.

1237
01:04:04,754 --> 01:04:06,620
<i>Trent!</i>

1238
01:04:06,622 --> 01:04:08,589
- CJ?
- Trent?

1239
01:04:08,591 --> 01:04:09,657
<i>Where's Rocky?</i>

1240
01:04:09,659 --> 01:04:11,625
- Wow. What are you...?
- What are you...? I...

1241
01:04:11,627 --> 01:04:14,360
This is so weird.

1242
01:04:14,362 --> 01:04:17,297
My dog just dragged me here.

1243
01:04:17,299 --> 01:04:18,599
But I don't know...

1244
01:04:18,601 --> 01:04:20,634
Um, do you live here?

1245
01:04:20,636 --> 01:04:22,603
Yeah, I just moved in. Uh...

1246
01:04:22,605 --> 01:04:24,572
Who's this little guy?

1247
01:04:24,574 --> 01:04:26,507
Oh, um, that's Max.
Be careful.

1248
01:04:26,509 --> 01:04:27,842
He's not very friendly.

1249
01:04:27,844 --> 01:04:30,343
<i>Oh, Trent,
I'm so glad to see you.</i>

1250
01:04:30,345 --> 01:04:31,679
<i>Where's Rocky?</i>

1251
01:04:31,681 --> 01:04:33,750
He seems pretty friendly to me.

1252
01:04:36,786 --> 01:04:40,420
I can't believe
you're in New York.

1253
01:04:40,422 --> 01:04:43,557
I never saw you
as a big-city guy.

1254
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:45,659
Well, I was in London
for a while.

1255
01:04:45,661 --> 01:04:47,595
And when the opportunity
came up here,

1256
01:04:47,597 --> 01:04:50,430
I thought to myself,
"Why not give it a try?"

1257
01:04:50,432 --> 01:04:52,533
<i>My nose told me Rocky was gone.</i>

1258
01:04:52,535 --> 01:04:53,901
<i>Poor Trent.</i>

1259
01:04:53,903 --> 01:04:56,670
<i>A person can't be happy
without a dog.</i>

1260
01:04:56,672 --> 01:04:58,939
Well, it's a pretty nice place.

1261
01:04:58,941 --> 01:05:00,306
You must be doing okay.

1262
01:05:00,308 --> 01:05:03,511
<i>I wonder what the snack
situation is here.</i>

1263
01:05:03,513 --> 01:05:05,378
Sorry.

1264
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:07,380
You know me.
I follow the rules.

1265
01:05:07,382 --> 01:05:10,350
I always admired how you
didn't care about the rules.

1266
01:05:10,352 --> 01:05:12,452
Mm. Yeah, well,
Gloria didn't exactly

1267
01:05:12,454 --> 01:05:14,454
teach me to follow rules.

1268
01:05:14,456 --> 01:05:15,689
How is your mom?

1269
01:05:15,691 --> 01:05:17,691
Oh, I don't know.

1270
01:05:17,693 --> 01:05:20,360
I haven't spoken to her
in years.

1271
01:05:20,362 --> 01:05:21,562
Mm.

1272
01:05:21,564 --> 01:05:23,130
How's the music career?

1273
01:05:23,132 --> 01:05:24,665
Good. Yeah.

1274
01:05:24,667 --> 01:05:26,500
I mean, it's hard.

1275
01:05:26,502 --> 01:05:28,702
Plus, I'm walking
all these dogs now

1276
01:05:28,704 --> 01:05:30,370
just to pay the bills.

1277
01:05:30,372 --> 01:05:31,572
So it's...

1278
01:05:31,574 --> 01:05:32,840
That's a relief.

1279
01:05:32,842 --> 01:05:34,642
Uh, for a second,
I thought you'd become

1280
01:05:34,644 --> 01:05:36,710
one of those
out-of-control dog ladies.

1281
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:40,648
<i>CJ was happy,
and it made her laugh.</i>

1282
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:42,550
<i>She never laughs with Barry.</i>

1283
01:05:42,552 --> 01:05:44,652
All right, well,
I should probably get going.

1284
01:05:44,654 --> 01:05:46,354
Yeah.

1285
01:05:47,990 --> 01:05:51,625
Hey, uh, my girlfriend
is coming in next weekend.

1286
01:05:51,627 --> 01:05:53,727
Uh, maybe we could do
a double date

1287
01:05:53,729 --> 01:05:54,995
with you and your boyfriend?

1288
01:05:54,997 --> 01:05:56,931
Yeah, sure, we'd love that.

1289
01:05:56,933 --> 01:05:58,464
Okay.

1290
01:05:58,466 --> 01:06:00,668
Okay.

1291
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:04,404
<i>CJ seemed sad
after we left Trent.</i>

1292
01:06:04,406 --> 01:06:06,607
<i>I could tell she wanted Trent
in our pack.</i>

1293
01:06:06,609 --> 01:06:08,175
<i>So did I.</i>

1294
01:06:08,177 --> 01:06:10,410
<i>Which meant...</i>

1295
01:06:10,412 --> 01:06:13,747
<i>Barry had to go.</i>

1296
01:06:13,749 --> 01:06:17,753
Hey. Hey, hey, hey! CJ!

1297
01:06:22,625 --> 01:06:25,928
<i>Barry's.</i>

1298
01:06:31,534 --> 01:06:32,967
CJ!

1299
01:06:32,969 --> 01:06:35,769
<i>I've been
holding this in all day,</i>

1300
01:06:35,771 --> 01:06:37,605
<i>and it's go time.</i>

1301
01:06:46,949 --> 01:06:48,549
CJ!

1302
01:06:48,551 --> 01:06:49,719
<i>Yes!</i>

1303
01:06:52,655 --> 01:06:54,855
<i>Just saying,
if I have to bite this guy</i>

1304
01:06:54,857 --> 01:06:56,824
<i>to get rid of him,
I absolutely will.</i>

1305
01:06:56,826 --> 01:06:59,894
Adopting a dog
was such a stupid decision.

1306
01:06:59,896 --> 01:07:01,530
Why are you saying that?

1307
01:07:02,665 --> 01:07:04,531
Look at you, CJ.

1308
01:07:04,533 --> 01:07:06,466
Your career is nowhere.

1309
01:07:06,468 --> 01:07:07,534
Okay, thanks, Barry.

1310
01:07:07,536 --> 01:07:09,637
I don't need any help
feeling bad about myself.

1311
01:07:09,639 --> 01:07:12,541
Yeah, well, I just don't think
you have what it takes.

1312
01:07:14,677 --> 01:07:16,812
I don't want to be here
anymore.

1313
01:07:17,914 --> 01:07:19,613
Where are you gonna go?

1314
01:07:19,615 --> 01:07:21,715
You gave up your apartment.
You have no money.

1315
01:07:21,717 --> 01:07:23,951
Yeah, well,
I will figure something out.

1316
01:07:23,953 --> 01:07:26,553
- Don't walk away from me.
- Don't touch me.

1317
01:07:30,526 --> 01:07:34,528
<i>We... don't... like... you.</i>

1318
01:07:35,698 --> 01:07:37,097
Duke?

1319
01:07:45,975 --> 01:07:47,510
Hey.

1320
01:07:48,611 --> 01:07:50,577
Thanks.

1321
01:07:50,579 --> 01:07:52,746
Amanda comes back next Tuesday.

1322
01:07:52,748 --> 01:07:54,748
She said it would be okay.

1323
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:57,584
We're not allowed dogs here,
so keep him on the down-low.

1324
01:07:57,586 --> 01:08:00,521
Okay. Thanks.

1325
01:08:00,523 --> 01:08:04,525

Oh. Hey, CJ.

- Sorry.
- Hi.

1360
01:09:29,045 --> 01:09:31,078
This is the old friend
I was telling you about.

1361
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,880
- Oh.
- Uh, Liesl, CJ.

1362
01:09:32,882 --> 01:09:34,181
- CJ, Liesl.
- Hi.

1363
01:09:34,183 --> 01:09:35,816
Hi. Nice to meet you.

1364
01:09:35,818 --> 01:09:37,885
Um, hey, so I left you
a bunch of messages.

1365
01:09:37,887 --> 01:09:39,086
You didn't get back.

1366
01:09:39,088 --> 01:09:41,088
- Is everything okay?
- Oh, yeah.

1367
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:44,625
Yeah, sorry.
Um, everything's great.

1368
01:09:44,627 --> 01:09:46,060
Really great, actually.

1369
01:09:46,062 --> 01:09:47,897
I, um... I-I was gonna, um...

1370
01:09:49,698 --> 01:09:52,699
I was...

1371
01:09:52,701 --> 01:09:55,702
Uh, C-CJ?

1372
01:09:55,704 --> 01:09:57,173
Sorry.

1373
01:10:00,009 --> 01:10:01,909
- Oh.
- <i>This smells way better</i>

1374
01:10:01,911 --> 01:10:03,677
<i>than the place we slept
last night.</i>

1375
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:05,913
- Yeah.
- Oh, wow.

1376
01:10:05,915 --> 01:10:07,114
Place looks great.

1377
01:10:07,116 --> 01:10:08,248
Yeah.

1378
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:10,017
Ah. You can stay right here

1379
01:10:10,019 --> 01:10:12,953
in the guest bedroom
until you find your own place.

1380
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:18,025
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be such a pain.

1381
01:10:18,027 --> 01:10:19,860
You're not being a pain.

1382
01:10:19,862 --> 01:10:22,930
I just need a little time
to get back on my feet.

1383
01:10:22,932 --> 01:10:24,865
Um, Trent?

1384
01:10:24,867 --> 01:10:26,867
Can I speak with you
for a second?

1385
01:10:28,871 --> 01:10:31,138
Okay.

1386
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:33,107
<i>Hmm.</i>

1387
01:10:33,109 --> 01:10:35,878
<i>I guess that dog
doesn't know how to walk.</i>

1388
01:10:37,913 --> 01:10:40,080
Feel like maybe
I'm getting you into trouble.

1389
01:10:40,082 --> 01:10:41,882
It's fine.

1390
01:10:41,884 --> 01:10:44,053
Liesl can be a little jealous.

1391
01:10:46,722 --> 01:10:48,722
Hey, is it okay if we sit down?

1392
01:10:48,724 --> 01:10:50,023
I'm exhausted.

1393
01:10:50,025 --> 01:10:51,758
Yeah, sure.

1394
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,727
You okay?

1395
01:10:53,729 --> 01:10:55,963
Yeah. Yeah, just, uh...

1396
01:10:55,965 --> 01:10:58,232
think I'm working too much.

1397
01:10:58,234 --> 01:11:00,067
- Oh.
- Excuse me.

1398
01:11:00,069 --> 01:11:03,170
So, Trent tells me that you're
a professional dog walker.

1399
01:11:03,172 --> 01:11:04,738
<i>What happened to you?</i>

1400
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:06,173
Oh, yeah.

1401
01:11:06,175 --> 01:11:07,774
Uh, just on the side.

1402
01:11:07,776 --> 01:11:10,210
Um, music is what
I really care about.

1403
01:11:10,212 --> 01:11:12,045
Oh, so you have a band?

1404
01:11:12,047 --> 01:11:13,313
Nope. No band.

1405
01:11:13,315 --> 01:11:15,215
Just me and my guitar.

1406
01:11:15,217 --> 01:11:16,917
- Oh, where do you play?
- Uh, well,

1407
01:11:16,919 --> 01:11:18,919
I haven't exactly
booked a gig yet.

1408
01:11:18,921 --> 01:11:20,787
Kind of just been working
on my songs.

1409
01:11:20,789 --> 01:11:22,156
I wanted to have a whole set

1410
01:11:22,158 --> 01:11:23,790
before I started playing
in public.

1411
01:11:23,792 --> 01:11:26,326
Oh. So, I mean,
music is on the side,

1412
01:11:26,328 --> 01:11:30,166
and dog walking is
your real job, then, right?

1413
01:11:33,936 --> 01:11:35,269
<i>Liesl didn't pee on anything,</i>

1414
01:11:35,271 --> 01:11:38,338
<i>but she was definitely
marking her territory.</i>

1415
01:11:43,145 --> 01:11:44,278
<i>Ready for food here.</i>

1416
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:46,280
<i>Let's go. Put the bowl down.</i>

1417
01:11:46,282 --> 01:11:48,115
Okay, okay.

1418
01:11:48,117 --> 01:11:50,184
Ah. Sit.

1419
01:11:50,186 --> 01:11:51,952
Good boy.

1420
01:11:53,989 --> 01:11:56,757
<i>Oh, this is delicious.
Best meal ever.</i>

1421
01:11:56,759 --> 01:11:58,025
Whoa. Slow down, Max.

1422
01:11:58,027 --> 01:11:59,092
<i>I'm done.</i>

1423
01:12:00,796 --> 01:12:02,930
<i>Trent!</i>

1424
01:12:02,932 --> 01:12:04,532
Tough day?

1425
01:12:04,534 --> 01:12:06,802
Not too bad.

1426
01:12:09,038 --> 01:12:11,238
Think I just need some sleep.

1427
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:14,841
- Yeah, I bet.
- Oh, hey, little guy.

1428
01:12:14,843 --> 01:12:17,044
<i>I literally just had
the best meal of my life.</i>

1429
01:12:17,947 --> 01:12:20,347
<i>Good to have Trent back
in the pack.</i>

1430
01:12:20,349 --> 01:12:22,985
Can I say something
you may not want to hear?

1431
01:12:24,119 --> 01:12:25,319
Sure.

1432
01:12:25,321 --> 01:12:27,555
I think you have stage fright.

1433
01:12:27,557 --> 01:12:29,957
<i>Wait, that smell.</i>

1434
01:12:29,959 --> 01:12:31,825
I...

1435
01:12:32,861 --> 01:12:34,361
Okay, fine.

1436
01:12:34,363 --> 01:12:38,999
Maybe I have
a little stage fright.

1437
01:12:39,001 --> 01:12:40,834
But... well, I don't know.

1438
01:12:40,836 --> 01:12:43,170
Maybe my songs
just aren't ready yet.

1439
01:12:43,172 --> 01:12:45,239
Hmm. Well...

1440
01:12:45,241 --> 01:12:48,942
<i>I remember that smell
from when I was Molly.</i>

1441
01:12:48,944 --> 01:12:50,344
How will you know
whether they're ready

1442
01:12:50,346 --> 01:12:52,145
if you don't play them?

1443
01:12:52,147 --> 01:12:53,581
Right?

1444
01:12:57,152 --> 01:12:58,819
Oh.

1445
01:12:58,821 --> 01:13:00,988
That's a cute little trick.

1446
01:13:00,990 --> 01:13:02,889
<i>I smelled the smell.
Now I get a treat.</i>

1447
01:13:02,891 --> 01:13:04,293
You see that?

1448
01:13:11,934 --> 01:13:13,902
Wow.

1449
01:13:18,007 --> 01:13:21,977
Trent, how long have you
been wiped out like this?

1450
01:13:23,045 --> 01:13:24,980
"Wiped out"?

1451
01:13:26,616 --> 01:13:28,616
Um...

1452
01:13:28,618 --> 01:13:30,618
actually...

1453
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:32,855
since I moved back from London.

1454
01:13:34,923 --> 01:13:38,125
I guess I'm...
I'm just jet-lagged.

1455
01:13:38,127 --> 01:13:40,861
You... do you think maybe
you should see a doctor?

1456
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:43,063
Just to make sure
everything's okay?

1457
01:13:43,065 --> 01:13:45,932
You're changing the subject
from your musical career.

1458
01:13:45,934 --> 01:13:48,201
I am gonna think
about that, okay?

1459
01:13:48,203 --> 01:13:50,806
Will you just please
go see a doctor?

1460
01:13:52,875 --> 01:13:55,242
- Okay.
- <i>Excuse me.</i>

1461
01:13:55,244 --> 01:13:57,913
<i>You owe me a treat.</i>

1462
01:14:04,219 --> 01:14:07,890
Gloria, stop calling me.

1463
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:13,226
♪ There's a girl... ♪

1464
01:14:13,228 --> 01:14:15,663
Come in.

1465
01:14:15,665 --> 01:14:17,898
Hey, uh, Liesl's here.

1466
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:19,099
Could you come out?

1467
01:14:19,101 --> 01:14:20,934
I want to tell you both
something.

1468
01:14:20,936 --> 01:14:22,838
Sure.

1469
01:14:28,077 --> 01:14:31,013
And they're sure it's cancer?

1470
01:14:32,381 --> 01:14:34,114
They're sure.

1471
01:14:34,116 --> 01:14:38,251
What did they tell you
about treatment options?

1472
01:14:38,253 --> 01:14:41,522
Well, the good news is, uh,
they caught it early.

1473
01:14:41,524 --> 01:14:43,459
But I'll have to do chemo.

1474
01:14:46,328 --> 01:14:48,395
Do you have to go
to the hospital?

1475
01:14:48,397 --> 01:14:50,130
I hate hospitals.
They terrify me.

1476
01:14:50,132 --> 01:14:52,199
You know that.

1477
01:14:52,201 --> 01:14:54,368
Then definitely
don't get cancer.

1478
01:14:56,539 --> 01:14:59,039
Why are you laughing?

1479
01:14:59,041 --> 01:15:02,309
Hey, hey, it was...
it was just a joke.

1480
01:15:02,311 --> 01:15:05,080
Do you really think that this
is the time to joke?

1481
01:15:07,116 --> 01:15:10,052
I... I need some air.

1482
01:15:14,524 --> 01:15:16,458
It'll be okay.

1483
01:15:29,739 --> 01:15:32,172
Thanks.

1484
01:15:32,174 --> 01:15:34,975
And what did she say?

1485
01:15:34,977 --> 01:15:38,147
She said she's not up
for being a nurse.

1486
01:15:40,182 --> 01:15:42,349
Wow.

1487
01:15:42,351 --> 01:15:45,053
That is pretty cold.

1488
01:15:48,457 --> 01:15:51,057
Ugh. Sorry.

1489
01:15:51,059 --> 01:15:53,126
Maybe it's for the better.

1490
01:15:53,128 --> 01:15:56,298
She'd probably find some way of
making it about herself anyway.

1491
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:00,601
Hey.

1492
01:16:04,273 --> 01:16:06,275
You know you're gonna
beat this.

1493
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:09,546
Right?

1494
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:13,146
Definitely.

1495
01:16:13,148 --> 01:16:15,083
I-I think.

1496
01:16:17,152 --> 01:16:19,354
I-I still can't believe this.

1497
01:16:21,423 --> 01:16:23,358
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

1498
01:16:25,093 --> 01:16:26,563
Thanks, CJ.

1499
01:16:28,063 --> 01:16:30,098
Everything's gonna be fine.

1500
01:16:40,409 --> 01:16:41,676
<i>Hmm.</i>

1501
01:16:41,678 --> 01:16:44,277
<i>They remind me of Ethan and
Hannah when they were young.</i>

1502
01:16:44,279 --> 01:16:47,115
<i>Ooh, do they want
to lick each other?</i>

1503
01:16:52,154 --> 01:16:54,555
Hey, I got to go
to the hospital, Max.

1504
01:16:54,557 --> 01:16:57,390
When I get back,
we'll go on a long walk, okay?

1505
01:16:57,392 --> 01:17:00,126
<i>Trent went away,
and then CJ was gone a lot.</i>

1506
01:17:01,396 --> 01:17:03,631
Ah. Stay, Max.

1507
01:17:03,633 --> 01:17:06,567
<i>Why say "walk"
if you don't mean "walk"?</i>

1508
01:17:09,404 --> 01:17:11,572
<i>Trent came home,
and he slept a lot.</i>

1509
01:17:11,574 --> 01:17:15,043
<i>He slept even more than me.</i>

1510
01:17:16,411 --> 01:17:18,546
Thank you.

1511
01:17:18,548 --> 01:17:22,082
<i>And I'd been biting
at this itch for a long time.</i>

1512
01:17:22,084 --> 01:17:24,685
Boy, you're really chewing
that spot, aren't you?

1513
01:17:24,687 --> 01:17:28,321
Maybe I should take you
to the vet.

1514
01:17:28,323 --> 01:17:30,058
Okay.

1515
01:17:35,097 --> 01:17:36,396
So?

1516
01:17:36,398 --> 01:17:38,398
It's really good.

1517
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:39,567
Really?

1518
01:17:39,569 --> 01:17:41,468
No, it's horrible.

1519
01:17:44,574 --> 01:17:47,075
- Here, I'm gonna try it.
- Uh...

1520
01:17:51,446 --> 01:17:53,179
Oh, it's really bad.

1521
01:17:53,181 --> 01:17:55,448
<i>Trent wore clothes for outside</i>

1522
01:17:55,450 --> 01:17:56,817
<i>even though he always
stayed inside.</i>

1523
01:17:56,819 --> 01:17:59,288
- It's healthy. Tastes healthy.
- <i>He looked ridiculous.</i>

1524
01:18:01,524 --> 01:18:03,456
Aw, I'm sorry, Max.

1525
01:18:03,458 --> 01:18:07,595
As soon as your leg heals,
we'll take it off, okay?

1526
01:18:14,202 --> 01:18:17,672
I don't know, Max.

1527
01:18:17,674 --> 01:18:20,206
Every time I think about
playing in public,

1528
01:18:20,208 --> 01:18:23,476
my heart just starts racing.

1529
01:18:23,478 --> 01:18:25,345
I don't know.

1530
01:18:25,347 --> 01:18:28,083
Maybe I don't have
what it takes.

1531
01:18:31,921 --> 01:18:36,323
<i>I wish this bed
was made out of bacon.</i>

1532
01:18:39,394 --> 01:18:41,596
You accidentally
gave someone your key?

1533
01:18:41,598 --> 01:18:44,464
<i>Does life get
any better than this?</i>

1534
01:18:46,468 --> 01:18:48,303
It's the doctor.

1535
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,506
Hi, Dr. Robbins.

1536
01:18:52,508 --> 01:18:55,342
Mm-hmm.

1537
01:18:55,344 --> 01:18:57,513
Okay, so what does that mean?

1538
01:19:00,650 --> 01:19:02,315
Okay.

1539
01:19:02,317 --> 01:19:04,252
Thank you. Will do.

1540
01:19:07,322 --> 01:19:09,422
What did she say?

1541
01:19:09,424 --> 01:19:12,361
Sh-Sh-She said my...
my scans were clean.

1542
01:19:15,263 --> 01:19:17,263
I'm cancer-free.

1543
01:19:17,265 --> 01:19:18,633
- Really?
- Yeah.

1544
01:19:18,635 --> 01:19:19,667
Oh, my God.

1545
01:19:29,378 --> 01:19:30,511
<i>I don't know why we're happy,</i>

1546
01:19:30,513 --> 01:19:31,646
<i>but it makes me happy.</i>

1547
01:19:37,285 --> 01:19:39,520
Come here. Come here.

1548
01:19:44,994 --> 01:19:45,860
Right, right.

1549
01:19:45,862 --> 01:19:47,561
<i>Trent came on our walks again.</i>

1550
01:19:47,563 --> 01:19:50,330
<i>It was so great
having him back.</i>

1551
01:19:50,332 --> 01:19:52,800
Gloria keeps texting me.

1552
01:19:52,802 --> 01:19:54,669
She's coming to New York.

1553
01:19:54,671 --> 01:19:56,336
You're gonna go see her?

1554
01:19:56,338 --> 01:19:58,238
Ugh, I don't know.

1555
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:00,007
It's been years, you know?

1556
01:20:00,009 --> 01:20:02,543
Plus, she makes me feel
terrible about myself.

1557
01:20:02,545 --> 01:20:04,377
She still has too much power
over you.

1558
01:20:04,379 --> 01:20:05,780
If you see her up close,

1559
01:20:05,782 --> 01:20:08,683
you'll just realize
she's just another person.

1560
01:20:08,685 --> 01:20:10,452
Yeah, maybe you're right.

1561
01:20:14,524 --> 01:20:16,423
You just got me through cancer.

1562
01:20:16,425 --> 01:20:18,391
You can face Gloria.

1563
01:20:18,393 --> 01:20:20,697
Hey, now I can be here for you.

1564
01:20:24,299 --> 01:20:25,599
<i>Come on, lick faces.</i>

1565
01:20:25,601 --> 01:20:28,336
Trent...

1566
01:20:30,573 --> 01:20:33,176
<i>Do it. You both want to.</i>

1567
01:20:36,546 --> 01:20:38,480
You're a really good friend.

1568
01:20:42,051 --> 01:20:43,617
<i>Are they ever going to...</i>

1569
01:20:43,619 --> 01:20:46,787
<i>I smell fresh poop!</i>

1570
01:20:46,789 --> 01:20:48,756
Right this way.

1571
01:20:48,758 --> 01:20:50,825
<i>I didn't understand</i>

1572
01:20:50,827 --> 01:20:52,593
- <i>why CJ was trembling.</i>
- Thank you.

1573
01:20:52,595 --> 01:20:55,696
<i>It wasn't windy or cold.</i>

1574
01:20:55,698 --> 01:20:57,700
Hi.

1575
01:20:58,768 --> 01:21:01,403
- Hi.
- Hi.

1576
01:21:04,306 --> 01:21:05,474
Please, sit down.

1577
01:21:08,343 --> 01:21:10,711
I'm sorry I had
to bring him with me.

1578
01:21:10,713 --> 01:21:12,648
Oh, of course. That's okay.

1579
01:21:15,518 --> 01:21:17,084
Oh, you're so beautiful.

1580
01:21:17,086 --> 01:21:20,420
- Some water.
- Thank you.

1581
01:21:20,422 --> 01:21:23,858
So, you've...
you've been living with Trent?

1582
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:26,459
Is that...
Are you two... are you dating?

1583
01:21:26,461 --> 01:21:27,561
Oh.

1584
01:21:27,563 --> 01:21:29,930
Well, he always had
such a thing for you.

1585
01:21:29,932 --> 01:21:33,636
No, we're, um...
we're just friends.

1586
01:21:35,805 --> 01:21:38,873
And what is going on
with your music?

1587
01:21:38,875 --> 01:21:42,676
Uh, just writing songs and...

1588
01:21:42,678 --> 01:21:45,813
you know, thinking about
maybe making a demo.

1589
01:21:45,815 --> 01:21:48,649
It's gonna be...

1590
01:21:48,651 --> 01:21:51,417
scary to get up
in front of an audience.

1591
01:21:51,419 --> 01:21:54,955
Yeah. Kind of wondering
if I'm cut out for it.

1592
01:21:54,957 --> 01:21:57,392
Well, if you don't try,
you'll never know.

1593
01:21:58,594 --> 01:22:00,561
So, what are you doing here,
Gloria?

1594
01:22:00,563 --> 01:22:02,863
Just so you know,
I don't have any money.

1595
01:22:02,865 --> 01:22:06,734
No, I don't want money
from you.

1596
01:22:06,736 --> 01:22:09,136
<i>I felt a different
feeling from Gloria.</i>

1597
01:22:09,138 --> 01:22:11,505
<i>Not angry. Sad.</i>

1598
01:22:11,507 --> 01:22:13,574
- Max, she hates dogs.
- Oh, God.

1599
01:22:13,576 --> 01:22:16,311
Can I... can I hold him?

1600
01:22:17,547 --> 01:22:19,647
Yeah.

1601
01:22:19,649 --> 01:22:22,683
Ah. Hey.
Want to come s-sit with me?

1602
01:22:22,685 --> 01:22:25,686
<i>If anybody ever needed a dog,</i>

1603
01:22:25,688 --> 01:22:26,921
- <i>it was Gloria.</i>
- Oh. Ah!

1604
01:22:26,923 --> 01:22:28,490
<i>She needed love.</i>

1605
01:22:30,726 --> 01:22:33,459
It must be nice to have...

1606
01:22:33,461 --> 01:22:37,497
something that loves you
like this, without conditions.

1607
01:22:37,499 --> 01:22:39,869
Because you probably
really needed that.

1608
01:22:42,572 --> 01:22:44,839
Yeah, I did.

1609
01:22:44,841 --> 01:22:47,942
So, Clarity, I...

1610
01:22:47,944 --> 01:22:51,477
I have been sober for, um,

1611
01:22:51,479 --> 01:22:55,182
nine months and 13 days.

1612
01:22:55,184 --> 01:22:57,417
And...

1613
01:22:57,419 --> 01:22:59,655
I was not a good mother.

1614
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:05,895
And I am s-so sorry, Clarity.

1615
01:23:07,563 --> 01:23:09,563
And...

1616
01:23:09,565 --> 01:23:12,633
if you'd let me, I'd...

1617
01:23:12,635 --> 01:23:15,538
really like to be
a part of your life.

1618
01:23:18,507 --> 01:23:20,776
I really want to trust you,
Gloria.

1619
01:23:24,614 --> 01:23:26,782
I just don't know if I can.

1620
01:23:29,652 --> 01:23:32,720
So, it's your father's birthday
next week.

1621
01:23:32,722 --> 01:23:34,622
I don't know if you knew that.

1622
01:23:34,624 --> 01:23:37,825
Um, and you are about
to turn the age

1623
01:23:37,827 --> 01:23:40,594
that he was when he died.

1624
01:23:40,596 --> 01:23:43,030
Which is so crazy.

1625
01:23:43,032 --> 01:23:45,666
Um...

1626
01:23:50,706 --> 01:23:54,942
I have some, uh,
letters from him

1627
01:23:54,944 --> 01:23:58,512
that he wrote to me
when I was pregnant...

1628
01:23:58,514 --> 01:23:59,813
with you.

1629
01:23:59,815 --> 01:24:01,815
Um...

1630
01:24:01,817 --> 01:24:03,951
and your grandparents
gave them to me.

1631
01:24:03,953 --> 01:24:07,788
And I...
I think you should have them.

1632
01:24:13,663 --> 01:24:15,963
I was so angry when he died.

1633
01:24:15,965 --> 01:24:18,532
And... scared.

1634
01:24:18,534 --> 01:24:21,635
And I was just... lost.

1635
01:24:21,637 --> 01:24:24,972
But, um, I realize now

1636
01:24:24,974 --> 01:24:27,741
it is so important
that you know who he was.

1637
01:24:27,743 --> 01:24:30,780
Because he was...

1638
01:24:33,683 --> 01:24:35,883
I don't want to read these,
Gloria.

1639
01:24:35,885 --> 01:24:37,685
Oh, yes, you do.

1640
01:24:37,687 --> 01:24:39,119
Yeah.

1641
01:24:39,121 --> 01:24:41,691
Just trust me
on that one thing.

1642
01:24:43,759 --> 01:24:46,694
And, um...

1643
01:24:46,696 --> 01:24:48,798
I know it-it may take time.

1644
01:24:50,866 --> 01:24:54,969
I do hope that someday
you can forgive me.

1645
01:24:58,007 --> 01:25:01,075
<i>Turns out Gloria's a
pretty good ear scratcher, too.</i>

1646
01:25:01,077 --> 01:25:04,513
<i>Maybe there is hope for her,
after all.</i>

1647
01:25:06,582 --> 01:25:08,849
<i>The papers smelled
like Hannah's boy.</i>

1648
01:25:08,851 --> 01:25:12,888
<i>They made me think of Ethan
and Hannah and the farm.</i>

1649
01:25:14,724 --> 01:25:17,858
<i>Gloria, I miss you.</i>

1650
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:20,761
<i>I think I'm gonna get
the Motorola job.</i>

1651
01:25:20,763 --> 01:25:23,063
<i>I saw an apartment
next to a park</i>

1652
01:25:23,065 --> 01:25:25,833
<i>that would be perfect
for the baby.</i>

1653
01:25:25,835 --> 01:25:27,601
<i>I know we're both scared,</i>

1654
01:25:27,603 --> 01:25:29,670
<i>but I finally have
some clarity.</i>

1655
01:25:29,672 --> 01:25:32,106
<i>We're so young, and we don't
know what we're doing.</i>

1656
01:25:32,108 --> 01:25:33,907
<i>But we have each other,</i>

1657
01:25:33,909 --> 01:25:36,710
<i>and we will figure it out
together.</i>

1658
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:40,047
<i>We can spend the summer
with my mom and Ethan</i>

1659
01:25:40,049 --> 01:25:41,081
<i>at the farm in Michigan.</i>

1660
01:25:41,083 --> 01:25:44,918
<i>I know my mom will be
super helpful to us.</i>

1661
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:49,023
<i>She is so excited
to be a grandmother.</i>

1662
01:25:49,025 --> 01:25:53,127
<i>I cannot wait to meet
our little girl.</i>

1663
01:25:53,129 --> 01:25:56,764
<i>How do you raise a child
to be strong and bold?</i>

1664
01:25:56,766 --> 01:25:58,932
<i>To believe in herself?</i>

1665
01:25:58,934 --> 01:26:01,969
<i>She'll have a good start
with you as her mom.</i>

1666
01:26:01,971 --> 01:26:05,773
<i>I have so many dreams for her and for us.</i>

1667
01:26:05,775 --> 01:26:08,909
Can't believe I'm taking
my mother's advice, but...

1668
01:26:10,746 --> 01:26:14,214
...if I don't try it,
I'll never know, will I, Max?

1669
01:26:14,216 --> 01:26:16,717
- Will I?
- <i>Sometimes the best thing you can do</i>

1670
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:18,052
<i>is just be there.</i>

1671
01:26:18,054 --> 01:26:19,186
<i>Even if your ribs get</i>

1672
01:26:19,188 --> 01:26:22,056

Oh!

1697
01:27:59,822 --> 01:28:01,188
You did it.

1698
01:28:02,825 --> 01:28:04,491
I'm so proud of you.

1699
01:28:04,493 --> 01:28:06,059
Hey, don't you feel good?

1700
01:28:06,061 --> 01:28:09,163
I, uh... I feel relieved.

1701
01:28:09,165 --> 01:28:10,831
That song about
your grandparents' farm

1702
01:28:10,833 --> 01:28:12,266
really got to me.

1703
01:28:12,268 --> 01:28:14,134
Uh, have you even been there?

1704
01:28:14,136 --> 01:28:17,037
Just when I was a baby, but...

1705
01:28:17,039 --> 01:28:18,939
I don't know.
Reading my dad's letters,

1706
01:28:18,941 --> 01:28:20,941
I kind of felt like
I remembered it.

1707
01:28:20,943 --> 01:28:23,944
I've been trying to think
of a way to repay you and Max.

1708
01:28:23,946 --> 01:28:26,213
Tonight just gave me
this crazy idea.

1709
01:28:26,215 --> 01:28:28,918
Would you be up
for a road trip?

1710
01:28:34,089 --> 01:28:37,057
<i>I love car rides,
but why am I tied down?</i>

1711
01:28:37,059 --> 01:28:39,295
<i>I really would like to put
my head out the window.</i>

1712
01:28:40,996 --> 01:28:44,033
He loves car rides.

1713
01:28:50,272 --> 01:28:51,539
<i>These smells.</i>

1714
01:28:51,541 --> 01:28:52,806
<i>Could it be?</i>

1715
01:28:56,946 --> 01:28:58,812
Can't believe I said yes
to this.

1716
01:29:01,350 --> 01:29:04,284
I think it's best to say yes
whenever possible.

1717
01:29:04,286 --> 01:29:05,886
Don't you think?

1718
01:29:07,056 --> 01:29:08,889
Okay.

1719
01:29:08,891 --> 01:29:10,891
Well, I wonder what
a city dog's

1720
01:29:10,893 --> 01:29:12,259
gonna make of this place.

1721
01:29:12,261 --> 01:29:14,261
<i>The farm! I'm back!</i>

1722
01:29:14,263 --> 01:29:16,096
Should we check it out?

1723
01:29:16,098 --> 01:29:17,231
Whoa.

1724
01:29:17,233 --> 01:29:19,266
<i>I smell horse-dogs!</i>

1725
01:29:19,268 --> 01:29:23,003
<i>I smell Hannah!
I smell my boy!</i>

1726
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:36,083
Hello.

1727
01:29:36,085 --> 01:29:38,120
Where'd you come from?

1728
01:29:41,123 --> 01:29:43,123
<i>Ethan, it's me!</i>

1729
01:29:43,125 --> 01:29:44,424
<i>It's Bailey, Bailey,
Bailey, Bailey.</i>

1730
01:29:44,426 --> 01:29:46,994
Ethan, wh-what's
going on out here?

1731
01:29:46,996 --> 01:29:48,328
- What...?
- Look at this.

1732
01:29:50,165 --> 01:29:52,332
Aren't you a cutie pie?

1733
01:29:55,204 --> 01:29:56,972
Who is your owner?

1734
01:30:00,242 --> 01:30:02,044
Hi.

1735
01:30:05,247 --> 01:30:07,314
I think...

1736
01:30:07,316 --> 01:30:10,786
you might be my Grandma Hannah?

1737
01:30:12,054 --> 01:30:13,320
I am.

1738
01:30:13,322 --> 01:30:14,888
CJ?

1739
01:30:18,927 --> 01:30:21,128
- Hi.
- Hi.

1740
01:30:30,105 --> 01:30:33,340
God, I feel like
I know this place.

1741
01:30:33,342 --> 01:30:35,075
Of course you do.

1742
01:30:35,077 --> 01:30:37,311
It's home.

1743
01:30:37,313 --> 01:30:38,445
CJ?

1744
01:30:38,447 --> 01:30:40,414
Y-You grew up.

1745
01:30:43,118 --> 01:30:45,419
I-Is that... is that your dog?

1746
01:30:45,421 --> 01:30:48,088
- Oh, yeah, that's, um... this is Max.
- Good.

1747
01:30:48,090 --> 01:30:50,157
Oh, be careful.
He's not very friendly.

1748
01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:52,959
Ooh.
Oh, yeah, you're a killer.

1749
01:30:52,961 --> 01:30:55,195
- Oh. Wow. Okay.
- Oh... oh, yeah, yeah.

1750
01:30:55,197 --> 01:30:56,330
Wow.

1751
01:30:56,332 --> 01:30:57,497
<i>I did what you told me, Ethan.</i>

1752
01:30:57,499 --> 01:31:00,067
<i>It was not easy. It took
a long time, but I did it.</i>

1753
01:31:00,069 --> 01:31:01,268
<i>I brought CJ home.</i>

1754
01:31:02,371 --> 01:31:04,338
Aw.

1755
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:07,374
- Aw.
- Hello.

1756
01:31:07,376 --> 01:31:10,043
Oh. Hi.

1757
01:31:10,045 --> 01:31:11,947
Nice to meet you.

1758
01:31:15,417 --> 01:31:17,217
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, that's beautiful.

1759
01:31:17,219 --> 01:31:18,985
Look at that.

1760
01:31:18,987 --> 01:31:20,320
Look at this one.

1761
01:31:22,257 --> 01:31:24,491
Oh, wow.

1762
01:31:24,493 --> 01:31:27,961
So, how long have you two
known each other?

1763
01:31:27,963 --> 01:31:29,463
- Oh, um...
- Uh...

1764
01:31:29,465 --> 01:31:31,264
Best friends
since we were ten years old.

1765
01:31:31,266 --> 01:31:32,332
Mm-hmm.

1766
01:31:32,334 --> 01:31:34,935
- Oh.
- So, you're not, uh...

1767
01:31:34,937 --> 01:31:37,003
Oh, no. No.

1768
01:31:37,005 --> 01:31:39,007
We're, um...
we're just friends.

1769
01:31:40,275 --> 01:31:41,410
Mm.

1770
01:31:44,012 --> 01:31:46,514
Gosh, I look so happy.

1771
01:31:46,516 --> 01:31:50,150
Why did my mother
keep me away from you?

1772
01:31:50,152 --> 01:31:52,419
Oh...

1773
01:31:52,421 --> 01:31:55,422
When your father died,
Gloria was so young,

1774
01:31:55,424 --> 01:31:59,960
and I think she thought
that the world was against her.

1775
01:31:59,962 --> 01:32:04,030
And she couldn't see
that we were on her side.

1776
01:32:04,032 --> 01:32:06,168
Right?

1777
01:32:07,436 --> 01:32:10,370
I'm gonna get
some more photo albums.

1778
01:32:10,372 --> 01:32:12,305
- Here. Take Bailey.
- Oh.

1779
01:32:12,307 --> 01:32:15,976
- His-his name's Max.
- Oh.

1780
01:32:15,978 --> 01:32:18,513
Okay... Max.

1781
01:32:18,515 --> 01:32:22,215
You know,
his real name is Bailey.

1782
01:32:22,217 --> 01:32:24,451
Ain't that right, Boss Dog?

1783
01:32:24,453 --> 01:32:26,253
That's right.

1784
01:32:26,255 --> 01:32:29,089
<i>I love when he
calls me "Boss Dog."</i>

1785
01:32:29,091 --> 01:32:30,424
The only thing I can't figure

1786
01:32:30,426 --> 01:32:33,193
is how Boss Dog can be
such a little guy.

1787
01:32:33,195 --> 01:32:35,362
Mm-hmm.

1788
01:32:35,364 --> 01:32:38,064
Wait, so, my dog
is actually your dog?

1789
01:32:38,066 --> 01:32:40,768
He's on permanent loan.

1790
01:32:40,770 --> 01:32:42,402
To you.

1791
01:32:42,404 --> 01:32:44,106
Okay.

1792
01:32:48,010 --> 01:32:51,478
Bailey was Ethan's dog
when he was a kid,

1793
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:55,616
and he always said that Bailey
came back as a different dog

1794
01:32:55,618 --> 01:32:59,252
and brought us back together
after many years apart.

1795
01:32:59,254 --> 01:33:02,590
And now he thinks
that Max is Bailey

1796
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:05,258
and Bailey's brought you to us.

1797
01:33:05,260 --> 01:33:06,561
She thinks I lost my marbles.

1798
01:33:06,563 --> 01:33:09,262
Oh, well...

1799
01:33:09,264 --> 01:33:10,798
Yeah, you do.

1800
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:14,802
- I know what I'm talking about on this one.
- Mm-hmm. Sure.

1801
01:33:14,804 --> 01:33:17,572
You don't believe me,
either, CJ, do you?

1802
01:33:20,476 --> 01:33:23,111
There's a lot you don't know
about that dog.

1803
01:33:25,815 --> 01:33:27,983
I could show you.

1804
01:33:30,653 --> 01:33:34,154
- Come on, Bailey.
- <i>Coming.</i>

1805
01:33:34,156 --> 01:33:36,091
Okay.

1806
01:33:41,263 --> 01:33:43,296
Yeah, it's been
a while since I've done this.

1807
01:33:43,298 --> 01:33:45,533
I used to do it standing up.

1808
01:33:45,535 --> 01:33:47,535
All right, you...

1809
01:33:47,537 --> 01:33:49,236
Okay, you ready?

1810
01:33:49,238 --> 01:33:51,839
<i>Let's do it
just like we used to.</i>

1811
01:33:51,841 --> 01:33:53,406
Huh? Okay.

1812
01:33:53,408 --> 01:33:54,609
One.

1813
01:33:56,178 --> 01:33:58,144
Two.

1814
01:33:58,146 --> 01:33:59,549
Three. Go!

1815
01:34:07,590 --> 01:34:09,557
<i>When did this thing get so big?</i>

1816
01:34:15,130 --> 01:34:16,697
Pr-Pretty great, right?

1817
01:34:16,699 --> 01:34:19,199
Wha...?

1818
01:34:19,201 --> 01:34:21,334
Only... only now the...

1819
01:34:21,336 --> 01:34:24,505
The football
weighs more than he does.

1820
01:34:24,507 --> 01:34:25,673
Wait.

1821
01:34:25,675 --> 01:34:27,240
How did...

1822
01:34:27,242 --> 01:34:30,312
I don't know how or what.

1823
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:33,380
When Bailey died,

1824
01:34:33,382 --> 01:34:35,716
I told him to take care of you.

1825
01:34:35,718 --> 01:34:38,418
To protect you.

1826
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:41,290
And I believe
that's what he did.

1827
01:34:43,191 --> 01:34:46,295
Ain't that right, Boss Dog?

1828
01:34:48,130 --> 01:34:51,433
It's kind of weird
when you finally get it, right?

1829
01:34:58,240 --> 01:34:59,441
Trent?

1830
01:35:00,510 --> 01:35:01,909
Trent!

1831
01:35:01,911 --> 01:35:03,176
<i>He's over there.</i>

1832
01:35:03,178 --> 01:35:04,477
<i>Uh, uh, I got to go, Ethan.</i>

1833
01:35:04,479 --> 01:35:06,481
<i>You told me to protect her.</i>

1834
01:35:27,436 --> 01:35:29,672
Trent. Trent!

1835
01:35:31,373 --> 01:35:33,708
Wh-What is it? What's wrong?

1836
01:35:36,378 --> 01:35:37,580
Nothing.

1837
01:35:38,948 --> 01:35:40,282
Nothing's wrong.

1838
01:35:49,324 --> 01:35:51,759
Max was Molly, Trent.

1839
01:35:51,761 --> 01:35:53,527
That's how he knew
you were sick.

1840
01:35:53,529 --> 01:35:56,597
- What?
- Max was Molly.

1841
01:35:56,599 --> 01:35:59,567
And before Molly,
he was Ethan's dog, Bailey.

1842
01:35:59,569 --> 01:36:02,503
And I think he was also
Big Dog,

1843
01:36:02,505 --> 01:36:05,773
who gave me its paw
and helped me win 50 dollars.

1844
01:36:05,775 --> 01:36:07,541
Uh, okay.

1845
01:36:09,311 --> 01:36:11,413
Max brought us together, Trent.

1846
01:36:12,815 --> 01:36:16,517
He found me,
and then he found you,

1847
01:36:16,519 --> 01:36:20,420
and then he saved your life.

1848
01:36:20,422 --> 01:36:22,422
All so we could be together.

1849
01:36:22,424 --> 01:36:23,658
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

1850
01:36:23,660 --> 01:36:25,793
<i>Would you just
lick faces already?</i>

1851
01:36:25,795 --> 01:36:28,361
Is it possible?

1852
01:36:28,363 --> 01:36:29,563
No.

1853
01:36:29,565 --> 01:36:31,701
No, it's utterly impossible.

1854
01:36:33,235 --> 01:36:35,237
But I guess it's true.

1855
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:40,242
I love you, Trent.

1856
01:36:42,011 --> 01:36:45,345
I've always loved you.

1857
01:36:45,347 --> 01:36:47,717
I've loved you forever.

1858
01:36:54,557 --> 01:36:56,224
<i>Finally.</i>

1859
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:12,840
Hey.

1860
01:37:12,842 --> 01:37:14,608
Thank you, Max.

1861
01:37:14,610 --> 01:37:16,476
And Molly.

1862
01:37:16,478 --> 01:37:18,779
And Bailey, and Big Dog.

1863
01:37:18,781 --> 01:37:20,817
<i>Those are all me.</i>

1864
01:37:24,587 --> 01:37:26,421
Yeah.

1865
01:37:29,792 --> 01:37:32,358
<i>I did what Ethan asked.</i>

1866
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:35,629
<i>I watched after CJ so that
she would have a good life,</i>

1867
01:37:35,631 --> 01:37:38,532
- <i>with a good pack.</i>
- Wow.

1868
01:37:38,534 --> 01:37:40,768
It looks great.

1869
01:37:40,770 --> 01:37:42,870
Hey, you want to hear a song
I wrote about you, Max?

1870
01:37:42,872 --> 01:37:46,372
<i>I never got tired
of hearing CJ say my name.</i>

1871
01:37:48,343 --> 01:37:50,911
<i>I had a lot of lives.</i>

1872
01:37:50,913 --> 01:37:52,680
<i>All different.</i>

1873
01:37:52,682 --> 01:37:54,682
<i>Sometimes I was big,</i>

1874
01:37:54,684 --> 01:37:57,685
<i>and sometimes I was small.</i>

1875
01:37:57,687 --> 01:38:00,554
Oh. Oh, here's Mama.

1876
01:38:00,556 --> 01:38:03,389
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, hey. How you doing?

1877
01:38:03,391 --> 01:38:04,658
- How you doing?
- Come here.

1878
01:38:04,660 --> 01:38:06,660
- Kiss.
- Hey, there.

1879
01:38:06,662 --> 01:38:07,895
Let's go see the dog.

1880
01:38:07,897 --> 01:38:10,564
<i>So many ups and downs.</i>

1881
01:38:10,566 --> 01:38:13,534
- <i>Even Gloria came around once in a while.</i>
- Yes.

1882
01:38:13,536 --> 01:38:15,772
<i>I trained her to play.</i>

1883
01:38:18,406 --> 01:38:20,841
Yeah. That's the puppy.

1884
01:38:20,843 --> 01:38:23,476
Oh.

1885
01:38:24,747 --> 01:38:27,415
<i>So many good-byes.</i>

1886
01:38:36,692 --> 01:38:40,728
<i>He'd been with me so many times
when I had to leave.</i>

1887
01:38:40,730 --> 01:38:44,732
<i>Now I got to be with him.</i>

1888
01:38:44,734 --> 01:38:48,569
We release Ethan
Montgomery into your care.

1889
01:38:48,571 --> 01:38:50,604
May the Lord bless you
and keep you.

1890
01:38:50,606 --> 01:38:53,774
May the Lord's face shine
upon you and give you peace...

1891
01:38:58,981 --> 01:39:02,516
<i>So many people.</i>

1892
01:39:02,518 --> 01:39:05,853
<i>Through it all,
I let the people I loved</i>

1893
01:39:05,855 --> 01:39:08,556
<i>know just how much
I loved them.</i>

1894
01:39:08,558 --> 01:39:11,625
Hey. How's he doing?

1895
01:39:11,627 --> 01:39:14,462
He's just been lying there
all day.

1896
01:39:16,532 --> 01:39:18,701
You're a good boy, Max.

1897
01:39:19,836 --> 01:39:22,603
The best.

1898
01:39:22,605 --> 01:39:24,874
Where would we be without you?

1899
01:39:30,746 --> 01:39:33,381
You're a good dog, Molly Max.

1900
01:39:36,652 --> 01:39:39,589
You're such a good dog.

1901
01:39:42,625 --> 01:39:45,491
<i>Lying there
with my girl holding me,</i>

1902
