1
00:00:42,014 --> 00:00:45,852
LA GRANDE BOUFFE

2
00:02:20,253 --> 00:02:22,839
Are you taking the preserves too?

3
00:02:22,964 --> 00:02:24,716
I have to take a gift.

4
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:31,988
And you're also taking...

5
00:02:32,113 --> 00:02:35,324
your recipes and your knives.

6
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,845
Your poor father bought you
the best German knives.

7
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,474
And at 1 4, you left Carpugnino--

8
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,645
With your knives!
You've told us all that.

9
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:06,689
But what I don't see is...

10
00:03:06,814 --> 00:03:10,651
what you plan to do
with your damned knives this weekend.

11
00:03:12,361 --> 00:03:16,240
And do you have
lemon dishwashing products?

12
00:03:16,365 --> 00:03:18,159
Yes, there's that too.

13
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:23,206
Lemon freshness,
nature's own cleaner.

14
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:25,541
Did you remember rubber gloves?

15
00:03:32,131 --> 00:03:33,966
The new kind.

16
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:37,887
More sensitive.

17
00:03:41,057 --> 00:03:42,934
For housework...

18
00:03:44,977 --> 00:03:46,938
gloves are important.

19
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:51,526
Flexibility and toughness.

20
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:55,738
Flexibility, not to lose
the feel of the object.

21
00:03:55,863 --> 00:03:57,407
Toughness...

22
00:03:59,242 --> 00:04:01,536
for doing the work.

23
00:04:11,602 --> 00:04:16,232
That makes exactly four weeks
of taped shows.

24
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:18,776
I can leave in peace.
God, what a feeling!

25
00:04:18,901 --> 00:04:20,319
But then what?

26
00:04:20,445 --> 00:04:24,157
Then the project I told you about.

27
00:04:24,282 --> 00:04:27,452
Right now I need rest and solitude.

28
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:30,204
What's wrong? Take it easy.

29
00:04:30,288 --> 00:04:34,000
TV isn't your life.
Think about your life.

30
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:37,295
I think I'd better.
I'll try yoga.

31
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:42,633
Before I go, I'll do a good deed--
give my daughter a gift.

32
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:49,682
I've been waiting 45 minutes.

33
00:05:05,114 --> 00:05:07,492
When one decides to get away--

34
00:05:07,617 --> 00:05:11,245
Where are you going?
Why did you ask me to come?

35
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:13,331
To see you before I leave.

36
00:05:13,456 --> 00:05:15,833
If I wait to hear from you--

37
00:05:17,543 --> 00:05:20,922
- Seen your mother? How is she?
- I guess she's fine.

38
00:05:21,005 --> 00:05:25,927
- I take it you don't see her much?
- Oh, that paternal authority.

39
00:05:26,052 --> 00:05:28,054
I'm going.

40
00:05:28,179 --> 00:05:30,139
A series of news reports.

41
00:05:32,725 --> 00:05:35,603
Would you like to use
the apartment?

42
00:05:35,686 --> 00:05:38,022
No hell-raising.

43
00:05:38,147 --> 00:05:41,150
Watch out for the neighbors--
all old fools.

44
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:43,528
Fuck paternal authority.

45
00:05:44,695 --> 00:05:45,988
What else?

46
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,723
I'd like you to find him a job
before you go.

47
00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:01,352
He's a great dancer.
I want you to get him work.

48
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,893
No more shuttle,
and the bus has gone.

49
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:08,377
There they are.
Careful. It's heavy.

50
00:07:28,356 --> 00:07:31,457
You can roll it.

51
00:08:10,037 --> 00:08:11,664
1 0:00.

52
00:08:26,971 --> 00:08:28,681
Wake up.

53
00:08:34,854 --> 00:08:38,483
That work still isn't finished.

54
00:08:44,113 --> 00:08:47,283
Give me a number
where I can reach you...

55
00:08:47,408 --> 00:08:49,243
in an emergency.

56
00:08:52,747 --> 00:08:55,833
Why must I always tell you
where I go?

57
00:08:55,917 --> 00:08:57,877
I have to know.

58
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,837
Your slippers.

59
00:09:01,255 --> 00:09:03,841
God, give me patience.

60
00:09:45,314 --> 00:09:47,108
The court having deliberated...

61
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:51,154
and, in accordance
with the evidence, convicted--

62
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:54,365
If my colleagues could see me.

63
00:09:55,616 --> 00:09:57,827
They take me for a serious man!

64
00:09:59,662 --> 00:10:02,248
For the last time,
where are you going?

65
00:10:02,331 --> 00:10:03,958
But I've told you...

66
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:07,378
to a legal conference in London.

67
00:10:07,503 --> 00:10:10,673
That's not true. You're a liar.

68
00:10:19,348 --> 00:10:22,810
Let's not fight, especially today.

69
00:10:22,935 --> 00:10:24,687
Why particularly today?

70
00:10:27,398 --> 00:10:28,941
Don't worry.

71
00:10:29,025 --> 00:10:33,738
I've arranged for you to have
a power of attorney at the bank.

72
00:10:35,031 --> 00:10:36,657
Understand?

73
00:10:38,951 --> 00:10:41,704
What are you talking about?

74
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:48,085
No, not that.

75
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:51,771
You're responsible
to your parents, poor dears.

76
00:10:51,896 --> 00:10:56,776
But I won't be involved in all this!
The picture stays here.

77
00:10:56,901 --> 00:10:59,237
I've given my life for what?

78
00:10:59,362 --> 00:11:01,364
To not know where you're going!

79
00:11:06,786 --> 00:11:09,872
I understand.

80
00:11:09,956 --> 00:11:12,250
You're going to the whores again.

81
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,461
- Give me the picture.
- Never!

82
00:11:15,586 --> 00:11:17,213
You're crazy.

83
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:26,055
Don't do it. Don't go there.

84
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,432
Think of your career!

85
00:11:28,516 --> 00:11:31,227
Promise me you won't do it.

86
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,856
I'll sacrifice myself,
as I always have.

87
00:11:34,939 --> 00:11:37,942
We can keep it in the family.

88
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:42,864
Nicole, do you know
what you're saying?

89
00:11:42,947 --> 00:11:47,034
Who rocked you in her arms?
Who suckled you?

90
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:56,627
I've got to go.

91
00:12:00,214 --> 00:12:02,466
You always rape me, and--

92
00:12:05,178 --> 00:12:08,055
Do you think whores
can take my place?

93
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:09,765
No, Philippe.

94
00:12:41,437 --> 00:12:43,439
Eating alone, eh?

95
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:46,043
It's a house my father bought...

96
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:50,590
just after World War I,
from a Polish engineer...

97
00:13:50,715 --> 00:13:53,092
to give to my mother.

98
00:13:53,217 --> 00:13:55,178
But she'd never live here.

99
00:13:55,261 --> 00:13:57,180
Lend me your hat?

100
00:13:57,263 --> 00:14:00,683
She found it too frivolous...

101
00:14:00,766 --> 00:14:04,061
so we stayed
at the apartment in Paris.

102
00:14:06,731 --> 00:14:08,357
There's old Hector...

103
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:12,501
my father's old chauffeur.

104
00:14:12,627 --> 00:14:14,420
How old is he?

105
00:14:14,504 --> 00:14:18,591
I can't say,
but I've always known him.

106
00:14:18,674 --> 00:14:21,010
Now he lives here alone...

107
00:14:23,221 --> 00:14:24,847
with the dog.

108
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:30,102
This is Ugo.

109
00:14:32,813 --> 00:14:35,066
This is old Catherine.

110
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:39,737
I think you will be pleased.
I spared no expense.

111
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,657
Everything is of the finest quality.

112
00:14:45,076 --> 00:14:46,619
Can we go in now?

113
00:14:46,744 --> 00:14:50,206
Tell your friends
the dog is very mean.

114
00:14:50,331 --> 00:14:54,418
Watch out for the dog.
He's not always nice.

115
00:15:13,688 --> 00:15:16,148
- How are you, Hector?
- Fine, Mr. Philippe.

116
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:25,950
- Where are you going?
- Upstairs.

117
00:15:26,033 --> 00:15:27,994
Who is that, Hector?

118
00:15:28,077 --> 00:15:31,038
A man from the Chinese Embassy.
He has a gift.

119
00:15:40,923 --> 00:15:44,802
Excuse me. I'll see to my guests
and be right with you.

120
00:15:44,886 --> 00:15:46,929
I have plenty of time.

121
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:54,202
Exploring, Captain?

122
00:15:59,665 --> 00:16:03,669
It's a stroke of luck...

123
00:16:03,753 --> 00:16:05,630
your finding me here!

124
00:16:05,755 --> 00:16:07,798
I rarely come to this house...

125
00:16:07,924 --> 00:16:10,259
though it's mine,
or was my father's.

126
00:16:10,343 --> 00:16:14,472
Excuse me, sir. Mr. President,
I've got to see the kitchen.

127
00:16:14,597 --> 00:16:18,267
- There's work to be done.
- Please sit down. I'll be right back.

128
00:16:18,392 --> 00:16:22,480
Hector, let's see the wonders
you've wrought in the kitchen.

129
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,767
Taste this!

130
00:17:00,935 --> 00:17:02,812
- Blood pudding?
- No, thank you.

131
00:17:02,937 --> 00:17:05,606
Is the wind still from your place?

132
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:08,651
Where's the cheese?

133
00:17:10,486 --> 00:17:12,446
Nobody for blood pudding?

134
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:23,040
Marcello, our friends want you.

135
00:17:23,165 --> 00:17:26,794
Sir, allow me to offer you
a little welcoming snack.

136
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:31,689
We are gathered
for a gastronomic seminar.

137
00:17:31,772 --> 00:17:34,734
Allow me to present a small gift.

138
00:17:38,404 --> 00:17:40,823
It is a character...

139
00:17:40,907 --> 00:17:44,076
from our theater called
"The Red Lantern."

140
00:17:45,995 --> 00:17:47,788
It's really superb!

141
00:17:52,752 --> 00:17:55,463
"Beware of Greeks bearing gifts."

142
00:17:56,756 --> 00:17:59,300
They want you.

143
00:17:59,383 --> 00:18:01,636
I'll take the Chinese room.

144
00:18:03,304 --> 00:18:07,099
I'm terribly sorry
to have to decline...

145
00:18:07,225 --> 00:18:09,435
your gracious offer.

146
00:18:10,895 --> 00:18:13,606
The car keys.
I left my suitcase.

147
00:18:13,731 --> 00:18:15,274
Can I taste?

148
00:18:16,734 --> 00:18:18,402
The small one.

149
00:18:18,527 --> 00:18:21,739
I understand your refusal perfectly.

150
00:18:21,822 --> 00:18:26,077
If an aura of sentiment
does not cling to a house...

151
00:18:26,202 --> 00:18:30,581
if the least of its walls
is not steeped in family tradition...

152
00:18:30,706 --> 00:18:33,584
then the idea of a home
is an empty one.

153
00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:36,712
A fierce, wild boar...

154
00:18:36,796 --> 00:18:39,590
ready for all
the subtlest marinades.

155
00:18:39,674 --> 00:18:42,009
That's good meat.

156
00:18:42,093 --> 00:18:46,722
Two superb soft-eyed deer,
the flesh redolent...

157
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:48,516
of the Couves forest.

158
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:50,142
Is it frozen?

159
00:18:50,268 --> 00:18:53,563
So what? I'm all for progress
when necessary.

160
00:18:56,107 --> 00:18:58,693
That's good meat.

161
00:19:03,781 --> 00:19:06,826
Ten dozen semi-wild guinea hens...

162
00:19:06,951 --> 00:19:08,578
fed on grain and juniper.

163
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:17,852
Our friends want you.

164
00:19:20,813 --> 00:19:22,231
Nice sweater.

165
00:19:34,452 --> 00:19:36,245
Beautiful car, eh?

166
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:44,003
You know, Bugatti had
his shoes made to order...

167
00:19:44,128 --> 00:19:47,131
like gloves,
with a separate big toe.

168
00:19:48,925 --> 00:19:51,427
- To drive?
- No, for every day.

169
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,387
There was an artist!

170
00:19:54,847 --> 00:19:57,475
Look. What magnificence.

171
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,436
Three dozen young Ardennes roosters.

172
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:03,856
- What's going on?
- Twenty dozen Bresse chickens.

173
00:20:03,981 --> 00:20:07,860
Codfish. Oh, wow, does it stink!

174
00:20:07,985 --> 00:20:09,987
A hindquarter of beef...

175
00:20:10,112 --> 00:20:12,657
from the rich pastures
of Charolais.

176
00:20:13,866 --> 00:20:16,911
You'll see how much fun
it is to cut up.

177
00:20:17,036 --> 00:20:20,748
Five young salt-marsh lambs
from Mont St. Michel.

178
00:20:20,873 --> 00:20:22,875
A good cook could make...

179
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,710
a good surgeon!

180
00:20:26,712 --> 00:20:29,715
Always clowning,
while we do the work.

181
00:20:36,847 --> 00:20:38,641
Don't be vulgar, Ugo.

182
00:20:42,061 --> 00:20:44,188
The feast begins.

183
00:21:11,731 --> 00:21:13,232
That's good meat.

184
00:21:21,741 --> 00:21:24,243
I always did that as a child.

185
00:21:24,368 --> 00:21:26,871
Do you remember, Hector?

186
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,585
He's asleep.

187
00:22:03,032 --> 00:22:06,661
You can go now. Time for bed.

188
00:22:06,786 --> 00:22:09,163
Thanks for everything.

189
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:11,290
Still know how to drive?

190
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,419
I still have my license.

191
00:22:17,213 --> 00:22:19,006
Take the car back.

192
00:22:20,675 --> 00:22:23,010
Don't say a thing to Nicole.

193
00:22:30,032 --> 00:22:33,452
There's so much to do
to put this kitchen in order.

194
00:22:37,248 --> 00:22:38,833
Can we sing?

195
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:41,919
Remember, not a word to Nicole.

196
00:23:19,749 --> 00:23:22,919
Looks like Michelangelo's Pietà.

197
00:23:23,044 --> 00:23:25,713
I'm sure it's intentional.

198
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:27,798
A trifle blasphemous.

199
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,732
Marcello, ready to race?

200
00:24:25,538 --> 00:24:27,915
Fifteen seconds.

201
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:29,500
I lose.

202
00:24:39,677 --> 00:24:42,221
The expression of a whole era.

203
00:24:46,934 --> 00:24:49,562
I'm a sex maniac.

204
00:24:49,687 --> 00:24:52,857
You're getting hot over a funeral.

205
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:57,695
We're not getting hot.
It's a collection I made as a boy...

206
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,865
which is both sentimental
and artistic.

207
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,992
Now this is life. Look.

208
00:25:19,884 --> 00:25:21,719
Let's see.

209
00:25:24,221 --> 00:25:26,933
What artistic lighting.

210
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,906
What a splendid drawing.

211
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,325
A Gallé drawing, 1 890.

212
00:26:12,451 --> 00:26:13,995
Beautiful.

213
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,622
Open this, please.

214
00:26:16,747 --> 00:26:18,624
Which dessert?

215
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:21,502
Preserves or Crêpes Suzette?

216
00:26:21,627 --> 00:26:23,462
I'll have Crêpes Suzette.

217
00:26:26,173 --> 00:26:30,636
Gentlemen, we're not here
for a vulgar orgy.

218
00:26:31,971 --> 00:26:34,724
We can't just sit here forever.

219
00:26:34,807 --> 00:26:37,393
We must clear up this dining room.

220
00:26:57,121 --> 00:26:59,081
"Off to work we go."

221
00:27:06,172 --> 00:27:09,216
No, no oranges today.

222
00:27:10,509 --> 00:27:12,970
Tomorrow for breakfast.

223
00:27:38,427 --> 00:27:43,724
We have to skim the fat
from the bouillon.

224
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:47,561
We have to feed these turkeys...

225
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:51,691
chocolate, nuts and cognac.

226
00:27:51,774 --> 00:27:54,193
It gives an exquisite taste.

227
00:27:54,276 --> 00:27:55,903
So? What do we do?

228
00:27:56,028 --> 00:27:58,155
Are you my assistant or not?

229
00:27:58,239 --> 00:28:01,242
Then wash your hands.
Did you pee?

230
00:28:01,367 --> 00:28:03,202
What an idiot.

231
00:28:04,412 --> 00:28:07,039
- What time is it?
- 6:30.

232
00:28:10,293 --> 00:28:14,505
When I was a kitchen boy
at the Charlton Ceneto...

233
00:28:14,588 --> 00:28:16,924
know what time I got up?

234
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:18,509
4:00.

235
00:28:20,219 --> 00:28:22,805
Here's the stock.

236
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:27,393
The dough.

237
00:28:29,186 --> 00:28:31,022
- What's that?
- Conical strainer.

238
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:34,984
We're going to strain...

239
00:28:35,109 --> 00:28:37,069
the stock.

240
00:28:37,153 --> 00:28:39,655
Oh, very good.

241
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:43,743
Stock in the kitchen
is my stock in trade.

242
00:29:19,502 --> 00:29:21,629
Hello, Marcello. Up already?

243
00:29:26,175 --> 00:29:27,885
I didn't sleep.

244
00:29:42,692 --> 00:29:44,485
You're all set up!

245
00:29:44,568 --> 00:29:47,154
I like my chimney-nook.

246
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,198
It's my little world.

247
00:29:50,616 --> 00:29:52,493
A real homebody.

248
00:29:56,372 --> 00:29:58,207
Sorry, but...

249
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:01,544
I can't stay on
under these conditions.

250
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:05,715
What's wrong?
You don't like the house?

251
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,508
The change of atmosphere?

252
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:12,972
In my job,
I get used to sleeping anywhere...

253
00:30:14,223 --> 00:30:16,225
but I need to get laid.

254
00:30:20,563 --> 00:30:25,651
Sure, we're shutting
ourselves in here.

255
00:30:25,735 --> 00:30:29,030
But we didn't take a vow
of chastity!

256
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,785
Patience.
We'll talk about it later.

257
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,913
For now, let's think
about breakfast, okay?

258
00:30:59,742 --> 00:31:02,036
A nice hot chocolate...

259
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:03,746
around 11:00...

260
00:31:03,871 --> 00:31:07,083
whets the appetite for dinner.

261
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:08,793
Who wrote that?

262
00:31:08,918 --> 00:31:10,544
Brillat-Savarin.

263
00:31:18,511 --> 00:31:20,346
What have we here?

264
00:31:21,555 --> 00:31:23,432
Kidneys Bourguignon.

265
00:31:26,143 --> 00:31:28,646
It's for me.

266
00:31:28,729 --> 00:31:30,606
Shit! That's typical.

267
00:31:31,941 --> 00:31:33,651
A beautiful theme.

268
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:36,946
Very sexual.

269
00:32:10,396 --> 00:32:14,191
Actually, inviting girls...

270
00:32:14,275 --> 00:32:16,152
is a good idea.

271
00:32:22,533 --> 00:32:24,702
I like women too.

272
00:32:24,827 --> 00:32:27,705
I just think that
on this occasion...

273
00:32:27,788 --> 00:32:29,838
we could have done without.

274
00:32:39,523 --> 00:32:41,776
I'm no party pooper.

275
00:32:41,901 --> 00:32:44,779
You should do a special menu.

276
00:32:47,406 --> 00:32:49,784
"A dinner offered by...

277
00:32:49,909 --> 00:32:53,037
four Burgundian gentlemen...

278
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,456
to three nice Canterbury whores!"

279
00:32:56,457 --> 00:32:58,417
Ah, so they're whores, eh?

280
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,722
What did you expect?

281
00:33:21,607 --> 00:33:23,651
I've got a great menu idea.

282
00:33:23,776 --> 00:33:25,528
"The Whore Menu"!

283
00:33:27,822 --> 00:33:32,618
A sauté of fat and lean given
by four gourmand gourmets, epicures...

284
00:33:32,743 --> 00:33:35,121
for three young ladies
in twelve courses.

285
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:36,789
That's it.

286
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:40,584
Crayfish à la Mozart on a bed of
rice à la Sully, with Sauce Aurora.

287
00:33:40,668 --> 00:33:41,961
Not bad.

288
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:02,982
Can we see Boileau's linden tree?

289
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:05,067
The one in the garden?

290
00:34:05,151 --> 00:34:06,652
Who sent you?

291
00:34:06,736 --> 00:34:08,279
The teacher.

292
00:34:08,404 --> 00:34:12,256
She wants to see
Boileau's linden tree?

293
00:34:12,339 --> 00:34:15,843
Well, now, you tell her
to come whenever she wants.

294
00:34:17,261 --> 00:34:18,971
Are you an Arab?

295
00:34:19,055 --> 00:34:21,724
No. Don't worry.
I'm not an Arab.

296
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:23,684
Listen, children.

297
00:34:23,768 --> 00:34:27,313
Do you see this tree?
It's a linden tree.

298
00:34:27,438 --> 00:34:31,859
Mr. Boileau used to come sit under it.
Who knows who he was?

299
00:34:33,527 --> 00:34:35,363
No, you don't.

300
00:34:35,446 --> 00:34:38,866
Boileau was a great French poet.

301
00:34:38,991 --> 00:34:42,036
He was born in 1 636
and died in 1 71 1 .

302
00:34:42,161 --> 00:34:44,830
He wrote beautiful things.
He loved nature.

303
00:34:44,955 --> 00:34:48,667
And so he came here
to rest and wrote poems.

304
00:34:48,751 --> 00:34:53,589
"Hasten then softly,
and never lose heart.

305
00:34:53,714 --> 00:34:58,052
Twenty times on the loom,
keep on weaving your art."

306
00:34:58,135 --> 00:35:00,012
Understand what it means?

307
00:35:02,223 --> 00:35:05,101
Mr. Bugatti was an artist...

308
00:35:05,226 --> 00:35:07,895
like a painter or a musician.

309
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,231
This car is his art.

310
00:35:12,942 --> 00:35:14,735
Do you like cars?

311
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,207
Want some?

312
00:35:37,341 --> 00:35:40,511
Sir, are you the chef?

313
00:35:40,594 --> 00:35:43,723
At your service.
Eat, eat.

314
00:35:43,848 --> 00:35:47,893
- Smells good.
- Yes, it's stuffing for the pullets.

315
00:35:48,019 --> 00:35:51,871
We're doing another stuffing
for the suckling pigs.

316
00:35:55,875 --> 00:35:58,127
Know what they'll do with the fish?

317
00:35:58,210 --> 00:35:59,670
Eat them!

318
00:35:59,795 --> 00:36:03,632
My mean friends
want to eat them all.

319
00:36:06,052 --> 00:36:08,095
For the pig, something simple.

320
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:11,265
With the chestnuts, smoked bacon.

321
00:36:11,348 --> 00:36:13,142
Truffles. Beautiful, eh?

322
00:36:18,731 --> 00:36:20,441
Kidneys Bordelaise.

323
00:36:24,653 --> 00:36:27,198
Smells wonderful,
but I'm having chocolate.

324
00:36:27,323 --> 00:36:30,284
Oh, but you've never heard
of Roussel.

325
00:36:30,368 --> 00:36:32,578
He was a great writer.

326
00:36:32,661 --> 00:36:35,081
Little known,
somewhat surrealist.

327
00:36:35,164 --> 00:36:37,666
He used to roll
all three meals into one.

328
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:41,962
He always began
with hot chocolate and cream...

329
00:36:42,046 --> 00:36:46,509
and then something
like Kidneys à la Bordelaise.

330
00:36:54,683 --> 00:36:56,936
It's easy to make.

331
00:37:08,447 --> 00:37:10,074
Wonderful!

332
00:37:15,705 --> 00:37:17,707
Well, I have to go now.

333
00:37:18,874 --> 00:37:20,376
Now?

334
00:37:21,544 --> 00:37:23,963
Tonight we're giving
a little dinner.

335
00:37:24,046 --> 00:37:28,134
If you'd care to be our guest,
we'd be delighted.

336
00:37:28,217 --> 00:37:31,861
I don't think Mlle. Andrea
would be comfortable...

337
00:37:31,944 --> 00:37:34,280
with Marcello and Michel's guests.

338
00:37:34,405 --> 00:37:37,575
- Why not?
- I'm not sure I can come.

339
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,578
- She's a woman of the world.
- Exactly.

340
00:37:46,584 --> 00:37:48,586
I don't know if I'll come.

341
00:37:51,172 --> 00:37:54,467
Marcello, the great pilot!

342
00:37:57,094 --> 00:38:00,097
Pleased to see you.
Come this way.

343
00:38:00,222 --> 00:38:02,641
Come on. Come in.

344
00:38:13,652 --> 00:38:15,696
Take off your things.

345
00:38:17,823 --> 00:38:19,450
My friend Ugo.

346
00:38:28,167 --> 00:38:29,627
And you?

347
00:38:31,921 --> 00:38:34,799
- Do you like boas?
- What about you?

348
00:38:37,301 --> 00:38:39,178
What a meringue!

349
00:38:40,638 --> 00:38:42,473
- And me?
- Chocolate meringue.

350
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:48,312
That's nice.

351
00:38:48,437 --> 00:38:51,816
- It's a farce.
- What's a farce?

352
00:38:51,941 --> 00:38:55,861
The girls arrive,
and everyone disappears!

353
00:38:55,986 --> 00:38:59,115
- Predictably.
- Predictable to you.

354
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,618
- Oh, listen.
- I've had enough!

355
00:39:02,701 --> 00:39:05,913
Since we aren't eating,
I'll give it to the fish!

356
00:39:07,206 --> 00:39:09,667
Eat, little fishies! Eat!

357
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:14,687
Philippe is going crazy.

358
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:18,899
Hello. My name is Michel.

359
00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:22,945
Very pretty.

360
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:31,662
Ugo, time to go to the kitchen.

361
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:34,081
Okay, go to the kitchen.

362
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:38,836
You don't even look at me,
a poor little orphan.

363
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:41,255
Yes. Let's go to the kitchen.

364
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:45,968
- You're the third?
- Ladies and gentlemen!

365
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:48,471
In the splendor of her flesh...

366
00:39:48,554 --> 00:39:50,097
Gita!

367
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:28,010
Oh, you look great like that!

368
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:35,267
What's the chicken doing in here?
In an aquarium?

369
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:40,231
Isn't that weird?

370
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:43,567
It's a chicken-fish.

371
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:45,486
Isn't France wonderful.

372
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:47,279
You aren't French?

373
00:40:47,405 --> 00:40:49,657
There's my pâté...

374
00:40:51,006 --> 00:40:54,009
charcoal-grilled turkey
and the rest.

375
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:57,638
Do you know how to cook?

376
00:40:57,763 --> 00:40:59,890
No. I'd rather eat.

377
00:41:10,317 --> 00:41:13,696
I don't know who you are,
where you're from, but I like you.

378
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:24,749
I decided to accept.

379
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:28,711
How nice.

380
00:41:28,836 --> 00:41:30,963
You'll be in very good company.

381
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:36,719
Come in!

382
00:41:44,018 --> 00:41:45,561
What broke?

383
00:41:46,729 --> 00:41:48,272
The carafe.

384
00:41:50,024 --> 00:41:51,901
Make yourself comfortable.

385
00:41:53,486 --> 00:41:56,197
The house is even stranger
at night.

386
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:00,284
I'll leave you with these ladies.

387
00:42:00,367 --> 00:42:02,203
You might play billiards.

388
00:42:05,247 --> 00:42:07,166
Do you play billiards?

389
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:15,007
The mirage, the dream
has become reality.

390
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:16,550
A woman is here.

391
00:42:16,675 --> 00:42:18,677
- What woman?
- The schoolteacher.

392
00:42:20,262 --> 00:42:22,014
You see? She came!

393
00:42:23,891 --> 00:42:26,018
No. We're getting away
from all that!

394
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:28,229
- Don't be shy.
- Getting away from it.

395
00:42:28,354 --> 00:42:31,080
Inviting that poor girl
with your whores!

396
00:42:31,205 --> 00:42:34,166
I'm going to bed.
I leave you to your debauchery.

397
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,418
She's no whore.
She's a woman.

398
00:42:36,544 --> 00:42:38,045
The woman!

399
00:42:40,923 --> 00:42:42,758
Leaving, when I arrive?

400
00:42:42,883 --> 00:42:47,555
No, I was just going to the living room
to see how things are.

401
00:42:49,598 --> 00:42:51,183
Oh! Beautiful cake!

402
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:58,232
Yes. Ugo made it.
He's a master pastry chef.

403
00:42:58,315 --> 00:43:00,943
We're all his assistants here.

404
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:06,615
I was a bit embarrassed
to see you arrive just now.

405
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,910
They've invited three other girls
that I don't know.

406
00:43:09,994 --> 00:43:12,580
Yes, I saw them.
They seem very nice.

407
00:43:12,663 --> 00:43:14,248
Really?

408
00:43:14,373 --> 00:43:16,709
You don't mind dining with them?

409
00:43:16,792 --> 00:43:18,627
No. Why?

410
00:43:18,711 --> 00:43:20,296
Because...

411
00:43:20,421 --> 00:43:24,091
I suspect their morals
may be a trifle free...

412
00:43:24,175 --> 00:43:25,926
a trifle loose.

413
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:27,553
We'll see.

414
00:43:41,692 --> 00:43:46,280
Beautiful. A trifle melancholy.
Let us say it's awful!

415
00:43:46,363 --> 00:43:47,823
She finds it awful.

416
00:43:47,948 --> 00:43:52,828
The ideal would be to go on
eating like this, indefinitely.

417
00:43:52,953 --> 00:43:55,790
- What do you think?
- Yes, it'd be magnificent!

418
00:43:55,873 --> 00:43:58,501
The quail for you,
the rooster for me.

419
00:44:02,338 --> 00:44:04,673
I say a woman who likes food--

420
00:44:09,553 --> 00:44:11,612
Likes other things too.

421
00:44:13,656 --> 00:44:15,157
Pirate!

422
00:44:15,241 --> 00:44:17,743
Brigand! Excuse him.
He's an airline pilot.

423
00:44:20,246 --> 00:44:22,331
At my command, Ugo!

424
00:44:26,335 --> 00:44:29,296
- Your hand is cold.
- I have alabaster skin.

425
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:34,718
Eat!

426
00:44:36,637 --> 00:44:39,682
Mortadella must be eaten
in a sandwich.

427
00:44:39,765 --> 00:44:41,559
Aren't you hungry?

428
00:44:41,684 --> 00:44:43,644
I don't like to eat much.

429
00:44:45,062 --> 00:44:46,856
Worse luck for you.

430
00:44:46,939 --> 00:44:48,649
It looks that way.

431
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:54,989
It isn't necessary
to act like an animal.

432
00:44:55,072 --> 00:44:56,657
Italians abroad.

433
00:45:09,545 --> 00:45:12,882
I drink--
I'm not sure to what, but...

434
00:45:12,965 --> 00:45:14,592
I drink.

435
00:45:36,238 --> 00:45:38,657
I've reflected
on our morning's talk.

436
00:45:38,783 --> 00:45:42,912
I must say, I admire
your pedagogic theories.

437
00:45:55,981 --> 00:45:58,734
Relax a little, for God's sake.

438
00:46:00,611 --> 00:46:03,280
This hair gets in my way!

439
00:46:03,405 --> 00:46:05,157
Are you okay?

440
00:46:05,282 --> 00:46:07,284
You okay, my love?

441
00:46:07,409 --> 00:46:09,537
Loosen your seat belts!

442
00:46:09,662 --> 00:46:12,123
Fasten or loosen them?

443
00:46:30,558 --> 00:46:32,518
Tasted the pullet?

444
00:46:33,686 --> 00:46:36,564
Now on to the pork.

445
00:46:45,197 --> 00:46:47,032
The banderillas!

446
00:47:24,445 --> 00:47:26,030
Marvelous night!

447
00:47:26,113 --> 00:47:27,907
Come in. Close the door!

448
00:47:32,426 --> 00:47:34,220
Take off your panties.

449
00:47:56,784 --> 00:47:58,619
Take off your coat.

450
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:08,337
Do you like cars?

451
00:48:08,462 --> 00:48:10,214
Oh, yes, I adore them.

452
00:48:11,507 --> 00:48:13,300
What kind is it?

453
00:48:13,425 --> 00:48:15,010
A Bugatti.

454
00:48:18,472 --> 00:48:20,474
- Know what this is?
- What's it for?

455
00:48:20,558 --> 00:48:22,393
A manifold.

456
00:48:23,686 --> 00:48:25,646
- Like it?
- Very much.

457
00:48:32,528 --> 00:48:34,113
It's cold.

458
00:48:34,238 --> 00:48:36,657
Don't worry. It'll warm up.

459
00:48:36,782 --> 00:48:40,703
Come on. Like this.
Are you happy?

460
00:48:40,828 --> 00:48:42,663
Like it hard like that?

461
00:48:57,761 --> 00:49:01,307
Wanting to be Marlon Brando
is vanity.

462
00:49:08,772 --> 00:49:12,833
Besides, even Marlon Brando
is a kind of epiphenomenon.

463
00:49:18,464 --> 00:49:21,091
- Very good!
- "Vanity of vanities."

464
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:34,021
Ooh, Marlon, come here.

465
00:49:36,065 --> 00:49:37,691
Want some?

466
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:41,445
It's really good.

467
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:44,907
I really love it.

468
00:49:49,245 --> 00:49:52,373
My love. Oh, my love!

469
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:54,208
How I love you.

470
00:49:56,752 --> 00:49:58,754
An old record from my youth.

471
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:03,300
A very sensual melody,
you'll see.

472
00:51:07,004 --> 00:51:10,841
Outside of food,
all is epiphemomenal.

473
00:51:10,925 --> 00:51:15,346
Sand, beach, skiing, love, work...

474
00:51:15,471 --> 00:51:16,931
your bed...

475
00:51:17,014 --> 00:51:18,682
epiphenomena.

476
00:51:18,807 --> 00:51:20,684
Ecclesiastes says--

477
00:51:31,028 --> 00:51:32,488
Eat, my girl.

478
00:51:32,571 --> 00:51:34,198
Eat, bitch.

479
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,669
Funny, I've never known a judge.

480
00:51:48,212 --> 00:51:50,339
Meting out justice-- How exciting!

481
00:51:52,675 --> 00:51:56,470
It is more a case
of applying the law...

482
00:51:56,554 --> 00:51:59,223
which is often quite different.

483
00:51:59,348 --> 00:52:01,559
What a beautiful thing to say.

484
00:52:04,144 --> 00:52:07,189
It's as if we're alone together...

485
00:52:07,314 --> 00:52:09,275
out in the country.

486
00:52:14,572 --> 00:52:16,198
Afraid of me?

487
00:52:17,616 --> 00:52:19,910
No. I'm missing two buttons.

488
00:52:24,081 --> 00:52:26,750
Oh, poor baby!

489
00:52:26,876 --> 00:52:30,056
- If you like, I can sew them on.
- You know how?

490
00:52:30,186 --> 00:52:34,231
- That's very nice.
- Come, my frightened little judge.

491
00:52:34,315 --> 00:52:36,400
Here, eat this.

492
00:52:36,483 --> 00:52:39,528
I don't know if I'll find
the sewing things.

493
00:52:45,075 --> 00:52:49,246
Please, let's take a break
and go up and have some fun.

494
00:52:51,123 --> 00:52:53,083
There's plenty of time.

495
00:52:53,167 --> 00:52:54,793
Later. Eat. Eat.

496
00:52:54,919 --> 00:52:56,921
All you do is eat!

497
00:53:03,969 --> 00:53:05,971
Don't worry.
I won't prick you.

498
00:53:14,396 --> 00:53:16,732
Luckily, he's found
a little homemaker.

499
00:53:17,942 --> 00:53:19,610
The poor baby.

500
00:54:04,071 --> 00:54:06,073
Excuse me.

501
00:54:06,198 --> 00:54:08,242
Excuse me, Mademoiselle.

502
00:54:08,367 --> 00:54:10,384
I mean, Andrea.

503
00:54:27,151 --> 00:54:29,361
Allow me to request...

504
00:54:29,445 --> 00:54:32,156
your hand formally in marriage.

505
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:33,741
Please.

506
00:55:05,606 --> 00:55:07,233
Get up!

507
00:55:14,698 --> 00:55:17,910
My mother died when I was two,
two and a half.

508
00:55:17,993 --> 00:55:20,496
My nurse raised me.
That's her.

509
00:55:20,621 --> 00:55:22,498
- Poor Philippe.
- Beautiful, eh?

510
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:24,250
Very beautiful.

511
00:55:24,375 --> 00:55:26,293
A lovely face.

512
00:55:26,418 --> 00:55:28,921
Sorry.
They're waiting downstairs.

513
00:55:29,046 --> 00:55:31,924
Don't you know how to knock?

514
00:55:34,468 --> 00:55:36,887
He's so stupid!

515
00:55:36,971 --> 00:55:41,183
Don't worry.
We'll soon legitimize our situation.

516
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:50,249
Ugo, you know my friend.
She's marvelously gifted.

517
00:55:50,332 --> 00:55:52,126
I'll introduce you.

518
00:55:55,671 --> 00:56:00,134
On the operating table,
the redhead dies.

519
00:56:00,217 --> 00:56:03,304
Woman's body, vanity.

520
00:56:10,686 --> 00:56:13,856
Woman's body is vanity.

521
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:29,038
Gentlemen, I have
an important announcement to make.

522
00:56:30,623 --> 00:56:32,166
Gentlemen, please.

523
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,879
Mlle. Andrea and myself...

524
00:56:36,962 --> 00:56:38,881
have decided to marry.

525
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:04,865
I'm leaving.

526
00:57:04,949 --> 00:57:07,034
I threw up all night.

527
00:57:08,827 --> 00:57:11,330
Figure out the money with Anna.

528
00:57:16,085 --> 00:57:17,545
Bye, sweetie.

529
00:57:21,799 --> 00:57:23,676
Bye, everybody!

530
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:03,314
Michel, come to the table, please.

531
00:58:03,439 --> 00:58:06,525
I hate these rustic
checkered curtains.

532
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,611
We'll change them. No problem.

533
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:19,955
So you shut yourselves in here
every weekend to eat?

534
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:23,125
No, just now and then.

535
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:26,629
You eat this much each time?

536
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:29,757
This is different.

537
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:02,164
It'd go down better with salad.

538
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:04,375
You know, dykes are right.

539
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,878
Men are such a pain in the ass.

540
00:59:08,003 --> 00:59:10,896
What do we have to do to amuse you?

541
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,315
Something else
besides eat, eat, eat.

542
00:59:15,317 --> 00:59:18,988
- Play the pipes of Pan?
- For example, yes!

543
00:59:43,095 --> 00:59:44,763
A pizza provençale.

544
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:49,101
All the aroma of the moors.

545
00:59:49,226 --> 00:59:51,186
And the sparkle of your eyes.

546
00:59:56,859 --> 00:59:59,945
You're grotesque and disgusting!

547
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:03,824
Why do you eat if you're not hungry?
It's ridiculous!

548
01:00:22,217 --> 01:00:24,178
Michel is sick.
He wants you.

549
01:00:24,303 --> 01:00:25,930
Okay, I'm coming.

550
01:00:42,488 --> 01:00:43,030
Ohhh, I'm sick. I'm sick!
Don't be mean, Marcello.

551
01:00:47,826 --> 01:00:49,789
Easy, Marcello.

552
01:00:49,917 --> 01:00:52,012
Marcello, don't be mean.

553
01:00:54,181 --> 01:00:56,100
It's horrible!

554
01:00:56,183 --> 01:00:59,395
When I was little, my mother--

555
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,231
My mother used
to punish me terribly.

556
01:01:02,356 --> 01:01:06,986
This is the first time
since I've been grown up.

557
01:01:07,069 --> 01:01:09,238
Cut the tragedy. Open up.

558
01:01:09,363 --> 01:01:11,156
Push!

559
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:15,494
It will relieve the congestion.

560
01:01:15,619 --> 01:01:17,579
Push. Help.

561
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:37,057
You don't chew enough.

562
01:01:53,324 --> 01:01:55,367
Some well purée.

563
01:01:55,451 --> 01:01:57,911
Good purée. It's the adjective.

564
01:01:57,995 --> 01:02:00,873
- This isn't the moment, Philippe.
- Want some?

565
01:02:00,956 --> 01:02:05,961
To absorb the air.
Michel, I made it especially for you.

566
01:02:07,087 --> 01:02:09,548
You're wrong, Michel.

567
01:02:09,632 --> 01:02:12,426
You should take a little, you know.

568
01:02:17,264 --> 01:02:19,600
Easy. The platter.

569
01:02:22,186 --> 01:02:25,314
- Care for a little?
- Oh, yes, I adore purée.

570
01:02:29,318 --> 01:02:30,793
It isn't bad.

571
01:02:34,129 --> 01:02:36,048
It lacks butter, Ugo.

572
01:02:36,131 --> 01:02:38,801
It's meant to.

573
01:02:38,926 --> 01:02:41,303
- Why?
- It's a medicinal purée.

574
01:02:55,693 --> 01:02:59,405
- They'll all croak!
- Make an effort, Michel.

575
01:02:59,488 --> 01:03:01,615
It's a matter of will.

576
01:03:03,409 --> 01:03:07,329
Pretend you're a little
Indian boy in Bombay...

577
01:03:07,454 --> 01:03:10,624
and you're hungry--
very hungry.

578
01:03:10,749 --> 01:03:14,670
If you're very hungry,
what do you do? You eat!

579
01:03:20,301 --> 01:03:21,677
Pretending?

580
01:03:25,097 --> 01:03:26,807
Well, then...

581
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:28,809
eat some more.

582
01:03:39,737 --> 01:03:41,739
Eat some more, my pet.

583
01:03:45,367 --> 01:03:46,827
Eat!

584
01:03:48,203 --> 01:03:50,331
If you don't eat...

585
01:03:52,333 --> 01:03:54,460
you won't die.

586
01:04:00,883 --> 01:04:02,843
You've got to eat.

587
01:04:06,096 --> 01:04:09,768
I thought Philippe would be
the first.

588
01:04:09,897 --> 01:04:11,742
The judge.

589
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:17,331
They're crazy!

590
01:04:25,923 --> 01:04:29,385
Stay cool. Stay cool.

591
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:32,388
If they want to commit suicide,
let them.

592
01:04:32,471 --> 01:04:34,556
Come, Andrea. We're going.

593
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,642
Coming with us?

594
01:04:47,403 --> 01:04:49,780
All four of them
are imbeciles...

595
01:04:49,905 --> 01:04:51,907
idiots, mental deficients!

596
01:04:58,872 --> 01:05:02,751
You're wasting your time.
Leave too!

597
01:05:04,712 --> 01:05:06,171
No.

598
01:05:07,298 --> 01:05:08,924
I'm staying.

599
01:05:09,633 --> 01:05:11,969
What a tableau! Marvelous!

600
01:05:12,094 --> 01:05:14,179
A Sterlini still-life.

601
01:05:15,639 --> 01:05:17,641
A friend of mine.

602
01:05:18,767 --> 01:05:20,728
A great painter.

603
01:05:21,854 --> 01:05:25,482
I'm not sure
the starches are good...

604
01:05:25,607 --> 01:05:27,609
for my gas.

605
01:05:28,819 --> 01:05:30,446
I'm hungry!

606
01:05:32,865 --> 01:05:34,867
This will do you good.

607
01:05:56,028 --> 01:05:57,529
My name!

608
01:06:01,867 --> 01:06:06,789
It was a very delicate idea
of Ugo's. Very nice.

609
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:12,086
It looks good.

610
01:06:14,004 --> 01:06:16,006
I have trouble articulating.

611
01:06:17,758 --> 01:06:19,426
Diabetes.

612
01:06:25,683 --> 01:06:29,186
You know the history
of sauces, Michel.

613
01:06:33,649 --> 01:06:36,402
Do you know the story
of the Italian sauces...

614
01:06:36,527 --> 01:06:40,614
that were offered as a gift
by the Gonzagas?

615
01:06:40,739 --> 01:06:42,700
Don't you want to?

616
01:07:22,156 --> 01:07:24,283
Feeling better?

617
01:07:30,471 --> 01:07:33,849
Courage, Philippe.
Everything will be fine.

618
01:07:36,602 --> 01:07:39,146
Just a short spell
of fatigue.

619
01:07:44,526 --> 01:07:47,946
Tortellini in
cream-and-mushroom sauce!

620
01:08:15,516 --> 01:08:18,060
- I want some more.
- Yes. Wait.

621
01:08:30,322 --> 01:08:32,282
You don't mind.

622
01:08:35,035 --> 01:08:38,080
Can I stretch out
on your bed a bit?

623
01:08:57,141 --> 01:09:00,310
I don't know what's wrong.
I'm shivering.

624
01:09:03,981 --> 01:09:05,983
With Philippe's permission.

625
01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:09,445
Come. I'd like to lie down.
I'm cold, sick.

626
01:09:09,570 --> 01:09:12,046
Of course,
if it's for your health.

627
01:09:23,599 --> 01:09:25,059
Get comfortable.

628
01:09:34,693 --> 01:09:38,280
No, it's not nice to all get
on Marcello's bed.

629
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,060
Pants!

630
01:10:33,210 --> 01:10:35,963
Michel, I'm a woman! Come.

631
01:10:36,088 --> 01:10:38,298
Mustn't get sick.

632
01:10:38,424 --> 01:10:41,677
We must do it--
but staying alive.

633
01:10:41,802 --> 01:10:44,471
- Who-- Who's cooking?
- Sleep, Philippe.

634
01:10:44,596 --> 01:10:47,057
Is anyone
in the kitchen?

635
01:10:48,183 --> 01:10:53,454
Michel, it's your fault.
You got me excited, dancing.

636
01:10:53,537 --> 01:10:56,623
Here. Touch. Touch.
I'm all wet.

637
01:11:38,499 --> 01:11:41,043
See how worked up I am.

638
01:12:51,754 --> 01:12:55,758
Philippe, you've never sent anyone
to the guillotine?

639
01:12:57,926 --> 01:12:59,428
That's different.

640
01:13:01,597 --> 01:13:04,141
I saw you sleep with Michel.

641
01:13:09,188 --> 01:13:11,190
That's not important.

642
01:13:13,567 --> 01:13:18,155
I'll marry you
even if you sleep with everyone.

643
01:13:19,365 --> 01:13:22,201
I know you're broad-minded.

644
01:13:24,953 --> 01:13:27,498
I have a button that's loose.

645
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:32,002
Later.
Now the turkeys.

646
01:13:50,396 --> 01:13:52,940
Do you want
a church wedding?

647
01:13:54,233 --> 01:13:56,193
Whatever you like.

648
01:14:08,205 --> 01:14:10,723
Look, Marcello.
She's doing the chopping.

649
01:14:17,521 --> 01:14:19,732
Lady assassin.

650
01:14:19,857 --> 01:14:21,859
I knew it.

651
01:14:25,404 --> 01:14:26,864
Happy?

652
01:14:28,449 --> 01:14:30,534
It's fine, yes.

653
01:14:30,617 --> 01:14:33,996
- And how's your baby?
- Please...

654
01:14:34,121 --> 01:14:36,623
don't joke about it.

655
01:14:37,875 --> 01:14:40,919
Feel it?
Feel how firm it is?

656
01:14:45,466 --> 01:14:48,594
What do you think
of this new communal living?

657
01:14:48,677 --> 01:14:51,180
What communal living?

658
01:14:51,305 --> 01:14:53,682
The bed!

659
01:14:53,807 --> 01:14:57,644
Hey, look. I should ask you that.
You've had the fun.

660
01:14:57,728 --> 01:14:59,563
Please, please.

661
01:15:04,943 --> 01:15:06,945
Found the solution?

662
01:15:07,071 --> 01:15:10,991
We have to enjoy ourselves.
We've got a long haul.

663
01:15:12,493 --> 01:15:14,286
Shit, it's fantastic.

664
01:15:26,507 --> 01:15:28,425
No, I wanted to--

665
01:16:19,783 --> 01:16:21,702
Come on. I've got a surprise.

666
01:16:23,203 --> 01:16:25,080
Be good. Sleep. Sleep.

667
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:56,111
Get in.

668
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:03,869
It's so beautiful.

669
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:06,955
You're the first
to have the honor.

670
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:08,999
You're very nice, Marcello.

671
01:17:12,544 --> 01:17:14,254
Does it work?

672
01:17:21,095 --> 01:17:23,263
It works!

673
01:18:40,773 --> 01:18:42,733
What a romantic spot!

674
01:19:56,155 --> 01:19:59,741
- Take off your coat.
- No, Marcello. I'm naked.

675
01:20:02,494 --> 01:20:05,873
- Take it off!
- It's cold.

676
01:20:05,998 --> 01:20:08,459
I thought about you
all night long.

677
01:20:08,542 --> 01:20:11,211
- You never look at me.
- I do! Come on. Take it off.

678
01:20:35,819 --> 01:20:37,279
Well?

679
01:20:39,156 --> 01:20:40,574
Turn around.

680
01:20:42,367 --> 01:20:44,453
Show me your fanny.

681
01:20:44,536 --> 01:20:46,580
Raise it.

682
01:20:46,705 --> 01:20:48,165
Raise it!

683
01:21:10,035 --> 01:21:12,871
- Think of Philippe.
- Philippe. This is love!

684
01:21:12,955 --> 01:21:14,414
I'm different.

685
01:21:20,087 --> 01:21:23,257
It's all the same to me.

686
01:21:23,382 --> 01:21:25,384
I'll marry her anyway.

687
01:21:28,428 --> 01:21:32,224
She does it out of goodness,
not vice.

688
01:21:33,934 --> 01:21:35,394
Understand?

689
01:21:42,943 --> 01:21:45,070
Come on. Time to eat.

690
01:21:45,195 --> 01:21:49,074
To the table! Time to eat!

691
01:21:57,166 --> 01:22:00,711
"...with an ornamental platter,
toast...

692
01:22:00,794 --> 01:22:03,046
and a bed of caviar...

693
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:06,925
the border garnished
with a bed of olives...

694
01:22:07,050 --> 01:22:10,512
slices of lemon,
cedar and sugar.

695
01:22:10,637 --> 01:22:15,601
A sweet course:
quartered oranges...

696
01:22:15,726 --> 01:22:17,770
sprinkled with sugar."

697
01:22:17,853 --> 01:22:20,105
Stop. I'm getting sick.

698
01:22:21,315 --> 01:22:23,442
A beautiful recipe.

699
01:22:23,525 --> 01:22:25,694
It's not finished.

700
01:22:31,882 --> 01:22:35,761
- Why are you sulking?
- I'm not sulking.

701
01:22:39,890 --> 01:22:41,892
You're very handsome today.

702
01:23:11,421 --> 01:23:12,881
Permit me.

703
01:23:14,216 --> 01:23:16,510
Philippe, be broad-minded.

704
01:23:26,728 --> 01:23:29,106
Big ass man,
this Marcello.

705
01:23:49,835 --> 01:23:52,463
Why is there no stuffing
in the turkey?

706
01:23:52,588 --> 01:23:56,717
Ugo, why didn't you put in
any stuffing? It's stupid. It's sad.

707
01:24:00,971 --> 01:24:03,182
It's sinister like that.

708
01:24:03,265 --> 01:24:05,601
It's dry. Look at it.

709
01:24:07,060 --> 01:24:08,520
It's spiritless.

710
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:13,582
There are other things.
There's purée.

711
01:24:13,707 --> 01:24:18,128
Crèmes-- apple, chestnut.

712
01:24:19,796 --> 01:24:21,799
And the stuffing?

713
01:24:22,966 --> 01:24:24,593
Life is stuffing.

714
01:25:04,508 --> 01:25:06,009
Stop eating.

715
01:25:10,848 --> 01:25:12,349
Stop!

716
01:26:35,572 --> 01:26:38,575
Chestnut purée
is one of my vices.

717
01:26:40,118 --> 01:26:44,832
A solitary vice, then.
I hate it.

718
01:26:44,957 --> 01:26:50,629
On the other hand,
I adore stewed apples...

719
01:26:50,754 --> 01:26:52,714
because they're so sweet.

720
01:26:57,344 --> 01:26:59,847
Too bad there are no pears.

721
01:27:06,144 --> 01:27:09,106
You've got to!
I've got to do it!

722
01:27:09,231 --> 01:27:12,067
I've done it
every night of my life.

723
01:27:18,365 --> 01:27:20,325
I've got to!

724
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:30,049
Oh, shit!

725
01:27:30,178 --> 01:27:32,144
I've got to do it!

726
01:27:43,030 --> 01:27:45,490
Marcello,
it's not my fault.

727
01:27:47,075 --> 01:27:49,328
Not your fault!

728
01:27:51,663 --> 01:27:55,417
You haven't understood! It's impossible
to eat yourself to death!

729
01:27:55,542 --> 01:27:57,002
I'm leaving!

730
01:28:06,678 --> 01:28:09,556
Calm down, Marcello.
Calm down.

731
01:28:15,437 --> 01:28:18,190
What is it?
What's going on, Marcello?

732
01:28:18,315 --> 01:28:20,484
He's right.
I am too fat.

733
01:28:22,653 --> 01:28:24,863
No, my little dove.

734
01:28:24,988 --> 01:28:27,908
You're beautiful.
You're not fat.

735
01:28:27,991 --> 01:28:32,037
You're soft,
you're graceful...

736
01:28:32,162 --> 01:28:35,582
you're light,
and you're a great cook.

737
01:28:37,251 --> 01:28:40,712
Yes. She's also sensual.

738
01:28:40,838 --> 01:28:45,008
You're three imbeciles.
That's the word that fits you.

739
01:28:45,092 --> 01:28:48,762
You can't eat yourselves to death
because you're eunuchs!

740
01:28:48,887 --> 01:28:51,139
Marcello, please. Eunuchs?

741
01:28:52,683 --> 01:28:55,477
If there's a eunuch, it's you.
You just proved it!

742
01:28:55,602 --> 01:28:57,563
All three of you!

743
01:29:04,111 --> 01:29:06,780
Stop!
This isn't the moment!

744
01:29:07,948 --> 01:29:11,091
He makes trouble! He acts jealous!
He plays the imbecile!

745
01:29:11,216 --> 01:29:13,427
There's no fantasy
in this story.

746
01:29:13,552 --> 01:29:16,972
You've picked
the most disgusting way to die!

747
01:29:17,055 --> 01:29:19,600
Go on. Wash your face.
Freshen up.

748
01:29:23,395 --> 01:29:27,107
Freshen up?
I don't need to freshen up!

749
01:29:27,191 --> 01:29:31,069
You need to freshen
your ideas!

750
01:29:31,153 --> 01:29:33,655
Look at this! What is this?

751
01:29:35,741 --> 01:29:38,952
Oh, shit! Shit!

752
01:29:39,036 --> 01:29:41,955
Marcello, what is it?
Are you hurt?

753
01:29:42,039 --> 01:29:45,667
- I'm covered with shit!
- Horrors! It's a tidal wave!

754
01:29:50,047 --> 01:29:52,841
My God, how horrible!

755
01:30:00,849 --> 01:30:04,102
Come help me!
It's a catastrophe!

756
01:30:04,186 --> 01:30:06,939
It's horrible!
It's filthy!

757
01:30:07,022 --> 01:30:09,816
It's appalling!
It's monstrous!

758
01:30:09,942 --> 01:30:11,944
Don't leave me alone!

759
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:19,660
The explosion--

760
01:30:24,831 --> 01:30:27,292
Don't leave me alone
like this!

761
01:30:36,385 --> 01:30:37,886
Come on!

762
01:30:48,230 --> 01:30:50,199
It's full of filth!

763
01:30:58,130 --> 01:31:00,883
I'm afraid
Ugo's a trifle sick.

764
01:31:01,008 --> 01:31:03,010
Yes, I think so.

765
01:31:10,350 --> 01:31:13,145
Me stay here?
You're crazy!

766
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:18,442
It's snowing.

767
01:31:22,237 --> 01:31:24,198
The wind's blowing.

768
01:31:26,617 --> 01:31:28,118
A snowstorm.

769
01:31:31,205 --> 01:31:35,751
The smell of shit.
We'll never be rid of it.

770
01:31:35,834 --> 01:31:38,420
Aren't you sleepy?

771
01:31:39,546 --> 01:31:42,716
Michel, after all the work
we've done?

772
01:31:42,799 --> 01:31:44,801
With this stink,
who can sleep?

773
01:31:44,927 --> 01:31:46,887
Come on. Let's sleep.

774
01:31:48,555 --> 01:31:50,515
The universal deluge...

775
01:31:51,683 --> 01:31:53,143
Of shit.

776
01:32:08,784 --> 01:32:12,663
Marcello is fighting
a plastic monster by his car.

777
01:32:15,958 --> 01:32:19,670
Did you see him?
He was afraid to die.

778
01:33:24,249 --> 01:33:25,709
He's gone.

779
01:36:24,585 --> 01:36:27,713
Michel, quiet.
The neighbors.

780
01:37:02,497 --> 01:37:06,376
- Philippe, we must bury him.
- Out of the question.

781
01:37:06,501 --> 01:37:08,795
"Illegal inhumanization
of corpse...

782
01:37:08,879 --> 01:37:10,881
strictly punishable by law."

783
01:37:11,006 --> 01:37:13,675
Article-- I forget.

784
01:37:16,261 --> 01:37:17,846
I'm cold.

785
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:18,714
Is it ready?

786
01:41:18,256 --> 01:41:20,217
Not bad at all.

787
01:41:34,064 --> 01:41:36,066
What are you making?

788
01:41:38,276 --> 01:41:40,237
Professional secret.

789
01:41:48,495 --> 01:41:50,497
A marvelous taste.

790
01:41:54,167 --> 01:41:56,128
Can I taste?

791
01:42:00,299 --> 01:42:04,970
- Didn't you sleep well?
- I slept, but I have a headache.

792
01:42:06,096 --> 01:42:08,056
Can I taste?

793
01:42:18,692 --> 01:42:20,652
Your mouth smells of borscht.

794
01:42:38,894 --> 01:42:41,605
Come. I've got an idea.

795
01:42:41,730 --> 01:42:43,690
What? Tell me.

796
01:42:44,566 --> 01:42:46,485
Tart Andrea!

797
01:42:46,568 --> 01:42:48,070
- Fantastic!
- See!

798
01:43:07,839 --> 01:43:09,383
Come on.

799
01:43:09,508 --> 01:43:10,968
Press! Press!

800
01:43:29,277 --> 01:43:33,156
You'll see. What a tart!

801
01:43:48,964 --> 01:43:51,967
I'm trying to do
some exercises, but...

802
01:43:53,260 --> 01:43:55,220
I'm a little tired.

803
01:43:56,722 --> 01:43:59,558
Did you see?
I found some straws...

804
01:43:59,641 --> 01:44:01,143
in the kitchen.

805
01:44:04,813 --> 01:44:06,815
For hot chocolate.

806
01:44:10,709 --> 01:44:13,211
I was an antiaircraft officer.

807
01:44:14,921 --> 01:44:17,632
Have some breakfast.
There's a surprise.

808
01:44:20,427 --> 01:44:23,263
A big surprise.

809
01:45:34,209 --> 01:45:37,212
Are we eating this tart
or not?

810
01:45:44,845 --> 01:45:47,347
You scared me.
I thought it was Marcello.

811
01:45:55,287 --> 01:45:57,289
No, it isn't Marcello.

812
01:45:57,414 --> 01:45:59,875
But he has
the pilot's insignia.

813
01:46:12,304 --> 01:46:13,764
Her ass.

814
01:46:16,475 --> 01:46:18,352
Want a piece?

815
01:46:18,477 --> 01:46:23,065
It looks good,
but not now. In a bit.

816
01:46:24,775 --> 01:46:26,234
Not eating?

817
01:46:38,914 --> 01:46:40,916
Marcello plays well.

818
01:46:42,793 --> 01:46:44,753
Almost as well as Michel.

819
01:47:04,356 --> 01:47:06,316
We're used to it.

820
01:48:37,172 --> 01:48:41,718
The difficulty is in the rapport
between the taste of the wine...

821
01:48:41,802 --> 01:48:44,054
and the moment
when each dish is ready.

822
01:48:44,137 --> 01:48:49,893
Each, first, must be steeped in the
juices in which it will partly cook.

823
01:48:49,976 --> 01:48:54,564
The final cooking will be done
in a brioche pastry.

824
01:48:57,317 --> 01:48:59,861
So let's start.

825
01:49:10,846 --> 01:49:12,806
Sherry for the chicken.

826
01:49:22,524 --> 01:49:24,526
Port for the duck.

827
01:49:33,201 --> 01:49:35,162
And champagne for the goose.

828
01:49:48,675 --> 01:49:50,635
A bit more.

829
01:50:26,213 --> 01:50:30,801
- Eat the brioche. You'll see.
- I love brioche in milk.

830
01:50:30,926 --> 01:50:33,762
Yes? Especially
for your diabetes.

831
01:50:36,598 --> 01:50:39,142
Why the egg slices?

832
01:50:39,267 --> 01:50:41,186
Because eggs...

833
01:50:41,269 --> 01:50:43,730
according to the Jews...

834
01:50:43,814 --> 01:50:45,732
are the symbol of death.

835
01:51:02,013 --> 01:51:04,891
I could be a millionaire
in one month...

836
01:51:04,975 --> 01:51:07,769
making these dishes for people.

837
01:51:07,894 --> 01:51:10,731
But they'll never know...

838
01:51:10,814 --> 01:51:12,816
what they're missing.

839
01:51:13,984 --> 01:51:16,611
We, on the other hand...

840
01:51:16,737 --> 01:51:18,739
and our friends.

841
01:51:19,948 --> 01:51:21,908
I drink to them.

842
01:51:49,478 --> 01:51:51,897
The honor goes to you.
You cut it.

843
01:51:53,023 --> 01:51:55,150
Cut that? How?

844
01:51:55,233 --> 01:51:58,695
I can't slice that.
It's too bulky!

845
01:52:00,822 --> 01:52:04,326
- It's pure poetry!
- Well, it's bulky poetry!

846
01:52:07,788 --> 01:52:09,748
Taste it with the fork.

847
01:52:11,541 --> 01:52:13,502
Just a bit.

848
01:52:17,923 --> 01:52:19,925
How is it?

849
01:52:24,096 --> 01:52:25,555
Shit.

850
01:52:28,850 --> 01:52:32,202
- You're not being sincere.
- It's shit poetry.

851
01:52:32,285 --> 01:52:34,246
Andrea, you taste it.

852
01:52:39,793 --> 01:52:42,087
It's good, isn't it?

853
01:52:42,212 --> 01:52:44,673
It's good,
but it won't go down.

854
01:52:46,258 --> 01:52:48,260
But we've got to eat!

855
01:52:52,764 --> 01:52:55,726
I'll eat it all myself,
and I'll cut it!

856
01:53:19,958 --> 01:53:21,460
It's marvelous!

857
01:53:22,711 --> 01:53:24,171
Marvelous!

858
01:53:42,814 --> 01:53:44,775
I'm going to sleep a bit.

859
01:53:46,359 --> 01:53:47,903
Coming, Andrea?

860
01:53:48,028 --> 01:53:51,239
No, I'll stay here with Ugo.

861
01:53:51,323 --> 01:53:53,325
I'll keep him company.

862
01:54:12,526 --> 01:54:14,528
Goose pâté.

863
01:54:14,611 --> 01:54:16,071
Chicken pâté.

864
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:18,740
Duck pâté.

865
01:54:26,957 --> 01:54:28,959
Philippe calls this shit!

866
01:54:31,878 --> 01:54:33,171
It's genius!

867
01:54:41,972 --> 01:54:45,600
Come to the kitchen.
Ugo's got to stop eating. Come!

868
01:54:48,937 --> 01:54:52,023
Ugo is old enough
to know what he's doing.

869
01:54:52,149 --> 01:54:54,109
Come. We'll both tell him.

870
01:54:56,445 --> 01:54:59,698
- I have no influence over him.
- Yes, we'll manage.

871
01:55:19,342 --> 01:55:21,136
Stop!

872
01:55:21,261 --> 01:55:23,722
Stop now!

873
01:55:23,805 --> 01:55:27,142
That's enough. Stop.

874
01:55:28,685 --> 01:55:30,645
Or else you'll die.

875
01:56:43,442 --> 01:56:45,444
Shut up, dogs!

876
01:57:06,214 --> 01:57:08,383
Tomorrow,
make me another pâté.

877
01:57:09,217 --> 01:57:11,219
And I'll eat it.

878
01:57:12,721 --> 01:57:14,723
All right.

879
01:57:19,311 --> 01:57:21,813
I'm heating you
some water, Ugo.

880
01:57:22,814 --> 01:57:25,525
It's good with sugar
for digestion.

881
01:57:37,260 --> 01:57:38,720
Listen!

882
01:57:40,931 --> 01:57:43,225
You owe me something.

883
01:57:43,350 --> 01:57:45,560
You know.

884
01:57:45,644 --> 01:57:47,104
Yes.

885
01:58:12,963 --> 01:58:14,965
Oh, that's good.

886
01:59:00,010 --> 01:59:02,220
I leave you...

887
01:59:02,345 --> 01:59:05,974
the tower as a souvenir.

888
01:59:21,296 --> 01:59:24,257
More! More!

889
02:00:20,564 --> 02:00:22,107
He's dead!

890
02:00:40,709 --> 02:00:43,211
Come, Philippe.
Let's go to bed.

891
02:00:46,715 --> 02:00:48,842
What do we do with Ugo?

892
02:00:48,967 --> 02:00:52,402
Leave him in the kitchen.
It's his domain.

893
02:00:52,527 --> 02:00:54,488
We'll think tomorrow.

894
02:02:23,368 --> 02:02:25,328
You're a glutton, Ugo.

895
02:02:28,331 --> 02:02:30,341
You eat too much.

896
02:02:31,600 --> 02:02:33,602
You always ate too much.

897
02:03:12,474 --> 02:03:13,975
For you.

898
02:03:14,100 --> 02:03:16,770
It's very sweet
and very good.

899
02:04:04,025 --> 02:04:06,987
God knows
what they think of me.

900
02:04:07,070 --> 02:04:09,489
That's enough, Ugo. Stop.

901
02:04:16,553 --> 02:04:19,055
They must think
I've abandoned them.

902
02:04:27,772 --> 02:04:29,816
Here we are...

903
02:04:29,900 --> 02:04:31,693
together, happy.

904
02:04:33,445 --> 02:04:35,530
And they--

905
02:04:35,655 --> 02:04:38,658
Wait here, Philippe.
I'll see who it is.

906
02:04:57,802 --> 02:05:01,056
Straight ahead.

907
02:05:01,181 --> 02:05:03,808
There's someone in the house.

908
02:05:11,942 --> 02:05:14,986
- The meat-- Where do we put it?
- In the garden.

909
02:05:19,449 --> 02:05:22,494
- This is good meat!
- Yes, in the garden, over there.

910
02:05:50,659 --> 02:05:53,206
A delivery of meat
just arrived.

911
02:05:57,836 --> 02:06:00,422
- Is it nice?
- Very nice, Philippe.

912
02:06:01,923 --> 02:06:04,426
Is it stamped "Grade A"?

913
02:06:05,552 --> 02:06:07,220
That's the best.

914
02:06:08,388 --> 02:06:10,348
Because last time...

915
02:06:13,602 --> 02:06:15,061
it wasn't.

916
02:06:20,233 --> 02:06:22,736
Tell your boss...

917
02:06:24,362 --> 02:06:28,450
that last time,
the veal was second-rate.

918
02:06:54,518 --> 02:06:56,520
I can't go on.

919
02:07:02,275 --> 02:07:04,277
Is that better?

920
02:07:14,496 --> 02:07:15,956
I'm cold.

921
02:08:13,153 --> 02:08:15,405
Is that okay, miss?

922
02:08:15,488 --> 02:08:17,240
Meat in the garden!
