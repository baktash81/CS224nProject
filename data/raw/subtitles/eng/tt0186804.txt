00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:18,677
          Newscaster:           
  Saturday is the beginning of  
garlic weekend in little Italy. 

2
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:22,047
In sports, both the yankees and 
 the mets were off last night.  

3
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,284
The yanks are in baltimore this 
evening for a three-game series 

4
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:26,518
        With the orioles        

5
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,353
          And the mets          
     travel to los angeles      

6
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:31,290
To begin the first of four      
    in dodger stadium.          

7
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:32,658
     Turning to the weather     

8
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:35,761
    Under blue skies,           
we'll have a high of 65 degrees 

9
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:38,997
  Dropping down to a low of 48  
    overnight in manhattan.     

10
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:41,533
Currently, it's 52 degrees      
        at central park         

11
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:45,170
    54 at jfk and 51 degrees    
        in newark.              

12
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,973
 As for the traffic, the f.D.R. 
    And the westside highway    

13
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:50,542
Are moving well with only       
light congestion so far.        

14
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:53,278
     The manhattan bridge       
     is also in good shape      

15
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,747
     With the williamsburg      
        and the brooklyn        

16
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,182
          Experiencing          
     some moderate delays.      

17
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,585
    The holland tunnel          
        is still jammed         

18
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,553
         As a result of         
  the surrounding construction  

19
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:04,690
  So you're better off taking   
the g.W. Or the lincoln tunnel. 

20
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:07,159
    The b.Q.E. And the bronx    
  are, as usual, a nightmare.   

21
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:09,895
  Alternate side of the street  
  parking rules are in effect   

22
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:14,066
And buses and subways are       
running with only minor delays. 

23
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,802
     Wcbs time is now 6:54.     

24
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:19,037
     Now for the headlines:     

25
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:21,440
    The war of words between    
      mayor bruce lincoln       

26
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,976
  And fire chief thomas ahearn  
      escalated yesterday       

27
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,845
     When ahearn submitted      
    his formal resignation.     

28
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,447
    Asked for comment           

29
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,382
         The mayor said         
    he would take time          

30
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,351
      To consider ahearn's      
        early departure         

31
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:34,586
 But hoped discussion of issues 
    could now continue          

32
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:38,123
  "without disruptive elements  
      impeding progress."       

33
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,425
  The developers of a westside  
          high rise...          

34
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,297
    What's the matter?          

35
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:49,067
    I think low rider           
    doesn't feel good.          

36

    He doesn't want to eat.     

37
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,537
    Try this.                   

38
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,772
            Oh, danny, no, no.  

39
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:55,374
                    Huh...      

40
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:56,608
                    What is it? 

41
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,344
    You usually eat more        
    than anyone in the house.   

42
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,579
            Is it your tummy?   

43
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:02,848
        Hey, maybe if you finish
        your breakfast          

44
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:04,016
            He would finish his.

45
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,951
            And you have...     
            Oh, seven minutes   

46
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,420
    To get your teeth brushed,  
    your clothes on             

47
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,088
  And out the door to school.   

48
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:13,425
            Mom, I really want  
            the pele video      
            for my birthday!    

49
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:15,294
          Okay, okay.           

50

51
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,516
        Hi, honey.              

52
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,518
  The phone rang for a while.   

53
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,588
     Thought maybe you had      
         already gone.          

54
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,524
            No, no.             
        I'm still here.

        since yesterday.        

57
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:52,464
             Dori?

    It's a good thing           
    that we miss you.           

60

        I miss you, too.

    Listen, you know,           
      I'm kind of rushed.       

62
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,142
         I want to make         
    the first speaker           

63
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:05,143

      Oh, yeah, of course.      

65

  You know, this is the third   
conference that you've been to. 

66

        All right!

69
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:20,125
    That every time we talk     
    it turns out this way?      

70
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:22,494
         We just called         
      to say good morning.      

71
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:25,831
  Dori, you've got to get back  
into the swing of things.

You gave up a thriving business.

74

I mean, you and I used to climb 
         every weekend.

                Hey, chief...   

255
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,183
                We're hanging in
                there with you. 

256
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,685
            You put the mayor   
            back in his place.  

257
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,119
    No, don't hang in there     
        too tight.              

258
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,487
    It's one thing to fight     
        city hall               

259
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,622
It's another thing to win.      

260
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:18,623
Doesn't matter.                 

261
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,692
You're taking care              
of your own.                    

262
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,694
Sir, I've got                   
a gas line rupture              

263
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,462
Somewhere in this building.     

264
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,231
Probably in the basement.       

265
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:29,500
Yeah. 100-year-old lines,       
they blow from time to time.    

266
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,935
Where are you?                  

267
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,270
We've got the building          
evacuated                       

268
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,771
But we're still waiting         
for utility                     

269
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,073
To shut down gas                
and electric.                   

270
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,975
Yeah. Well,                     
it's chilly out.                

271
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,143
Most of the windows             
are closed.                     

272
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:42,247
            You've metered the  
            explosive limits?   

273
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:43,781
We're smack in the middle       
             of it.             

274
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,117
  Best we could do considering  
    our response time.          

275
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:47,185
Gas is pretty strong.           

276
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,287
You'd better deploy             
ventilation equipment.          

277
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,055
                Well, yes, but  
                without con ed  

278
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,757
                Killing electric
                at the pole     

279
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,492
    We're risking an explosion. 

280
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,527
I don't want to get my men hurt.

281
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,596
     Nobody wants your men      
          to get hurt.          

282
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:01,299
    But somebody's got          
    to make a decision soon.    

283
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,903
                    Okay.       

284
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,372
    Let's deploy this equipment 
    and air this thing out.     

285
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,307
            O'leary, get that   
            fan installed.      

286
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:12,176
            Nickerson, mcauley, 
            you two go in.      

287
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,412
Let's open every window         
in the place.                   

288
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:46,577
Man:                            
Get back!                       
Get back!                       

289
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,981
    Are you all right?          

290
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,215
            Are you all right?  

291
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,518
            Now, breathe easy.  

292
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:54,619
            Just breathe easy.  

293
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:56,354
Oh, my god.                     
Hank, I'm so sorry.             

294
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:57,722
This never                      
should have                     
happened.                       

295
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:58,756
The building                    
was empty.                      

296
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,791
     We should have waited      

297
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,392
For con ed to cut off the power.

298
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:02,427
    It was a bad call.          

299
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,429
     It was the right call,     
        summerlin.              

300
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,430
      With all due respect      

301
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,332
You've been sitting behind      
a desk for a long time.         

302
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,233
I admire what you're doing      
    for the department          

303
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,536
    But you should keep your    
  fire fighting to city hall.   

304
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,139
                Hey! Get those  
                lines over here!

305
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,344
            Cabbie:             
        Is it your home?        

306
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,346
             Evie:              
    It belongs to the city.     

307
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,847
     The mayor lives here.      

308
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:23,848
        The mayor?              

309
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:24,983
      You know the mayor?       

310
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,884
        A little.               

311
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,054
    I'm his daughter.           

312
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,589
              No!               

313
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,625
 Well, this is very something.  

314
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,094
    I will introduce myself.    

315
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,762
      Nicholai karvoskya.       

316
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:39,163
         Evie lincoln.          

317
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:43,368
    Nice to meet you.           

318
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,670
    How long you been           
          in the city?          

319
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:46,904
         Three months.          

320
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,539
    Three long months.          

321
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:49,574
          Don't worry.          

322
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:50,808
      It only gets better.      

323
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,778
                        See ya. 

324
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,155
        ( <i>horn beeping loudly</i> ) 

325
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,442
                It's about time 
                you got here.   

326
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,110
Nice to see you, too.           

327
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,812
I like this.                    

328
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:31,816
             Well, let's say it 
             shows off the best 
             and hides the rest.

329
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,551
                Which is most   
                of me by now.   

330
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:34,685
Grandma...                      

331
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,254
              Man:              
    Now here's a sight          

332
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,522
         For sore eyes.         

333
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,925
     My two favorite women      
      in the whole world.       

334
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,295
     Always the politician.     

335
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:45,596
            You're right, mom.  

336
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,465
                You're right.   

337
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,067
Aren't mothers                  

338
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,234
         Always right?          

339
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:53,971
     Ladies and gentlemen,      
    mrs. Lincoln, my mother.    

340
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,873
          ( <i>applause</i> )          

341
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,844
        And ms. Lincoln,        
      my lovely daughter.       

342
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,046
          ( <i>applause</i> )          

343
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,450
     And dinner is served.      

344
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,619
Shall we, ladies?               

345
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,488
                    Daddy.      

346
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:14,659
Evie, I understand              
you have an upcoming meeting    

347
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,562
With bickerton,                 
craig and coleman.              

348
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,597
                How do you know 
                about that?     

349
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:22,033
I was in law review             
with bickerton.                 

350
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,367
He called me.                   

351
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,137
                        Daddy...

352
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,805
            This has to be      
            on my own merits.   

353
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,774
        If he's looking         
        for city contracts...   

354
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,209
Take it easy.                   
Take it easy.                   

355
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,710
Stop selling yourself           
short.                          

356
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:35,012
Last time I looked,             
you were the star               

357
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,281
Of the public defenders'        
office.                         

358
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,617
                Just not sure   
                if I want to    
                work there.     

359
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,419
        Maybe... I'm not ready. 

360
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,553
Nonsense.                       

361
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,589
Big paycheck,                   
big office...                   

362
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,390
You deserve                     
the opportunity.                

363
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,626
Look at your                    
track record.                   

364
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,496
                It's not just   
                about winning.  

365
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,264
    It's not?                   

366
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,932
Well, of course not.            

367
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,469
That only matters               
in elections.                   

368
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,738
Seriously now,                  
this bingham case...            

369
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:02,440
            It's a long shot.   

370
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,076
          I'm going to have to  
          win it in the closing.

371
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,211
Then it's a good yardstick.     

372
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:10,214
            I think this is why

The better we can respond.

Right now, we are swinging north
         over downtown.

  They're both still standing.

    pull some strings.

 Arteries to and from the city  
are completely devastated.

The streets appear to be nearly

That there are many, many people

01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:35,043
    We don't deploy             
    search and rescue.          

1130
01:08:35,077 --> 01:08:36,044
                You got that?   

1131
01:08:36,078 --> 01:08:38,213
All right. You heard him.       
Let's do it.                    

1132
01:08:46,489 --> 01:08:49,090
Your family all right?          

1133
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:53,094
            My daughter may be  
            under grant high.   

1134
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:54,963
                        Yours?  

1135
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:58,233
My mother is missing            

1136
01:08:58,267 --> 01:09:01,870
And my daughter is somewhere    
down in the damn subway.        

1137
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:05,673
Okay, here we go.               

1138
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:06,908
        Bert, be careful!       

1139
01:09:06,942 --> 01:09:09,944
We got you.                     
                Nice and slow.  

1140
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:10,979
Thank you.                      

1141
01:09:11,013 --> 01:09:12,680
     Okay, let's move out.      

1142
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:14,849
                Hey! Who put    
                you in charge?  

1143
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:19,087
Well, I don't want              
to stay here and die.           

1144
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:20,121
Do any of you?                  

1145
01:09:23,058 --> 01:09:26,427
My vote is we move on           
and find some way out of this.  

1146
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:33,801
            He's probably right.

1147
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:35,270
            Pretty cold, though.

1148
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:38,907
        You going to be         
        all right?              

1149
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:39,908
                Yeah, I think.  

1150
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:41,809
                Are you okay?   
Yeah.                           

1151
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:44,812
    I thought once we quit      
    gambling that, you know...  

1152
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:46,414
...Our luck would               
change, huh?                    

1153
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:49,150
We should have taken            
the bus like I said.            

1154
01:10:13,275 --> 01:10:15,243
             Hello?             

1155
01:10:15,277 --> 01:10:16,744
Is anybody here?                

1156
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,347
              Yes.              

1157
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:21,516
          I don't know          
        where to begin.         

1158
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:22,850
     Everything is broken.      

1159
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:27,155
I lost my contacts              
and I can't see a thing.        

1160
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:29,357
        If I could just         
        find my glasses         

1161
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:32,126
        Then maybe              
     I could find my shoes.     

1162
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:34,362
          Come on in.           

1163
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:41,269
    The elevators don't work    
    and the stairs are dark.    

1164
01:10:41,303 --> 01:10:43,471
I think we're marooned          
up here.                        

1165
01:10:43,505 --> 01:10:44,706
            I have              
            an extra flashlight 

1166
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:45,940
                With batteries. 

1167
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:47,442
            You can have that.  

1168
01:10:47,476 --> 01:10:49,477
Thank you.                      

1169
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:53,147
    What is it you're doing?    

1170
01:10:53,182 --> 01:10:56,517
    This is earthquake          
        survival stuff.         

1171
01:10:56,552 --> 01:10:59,020
    You're from california.     

1172
01:11:00,356 --> 01:11:01,956
             Yeah.              

1173
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:04,225
         I've been here         
         about a year.          

1174
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:07,128
  It's really just, you know,   
        essential stuff.        

1175
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:10,398
And you should have these       
band-aids for your feet.        

1176
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:16,838
        I'm alice.              

1177
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:19,440
             Dori.              

1178
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:23,778
            These are size six. 

1179
01:11:23,812 --> 01:11:25,413
                Will that help? 

1180
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:27,382
Uh, that's close enough.        

1181
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:29,550
I'm not going to complain.      

1182
01:11:29,585 --> 01:11:31,386
            You're going        
            to need socks, too. 

1183
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:33,087
Thank you.                      
You are so organized.           

1184
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,222
What do you do?                 

1185
01:11:34,256 --> 01:11:38,059
        I used to be an         
    interior designer.          

1186
01:11:38,093 --> 01:11:39,761
            Really?             

1187
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:41,729
      I love what you did       
        with the place.         

1188
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,640
    You should stay inside.     

1189
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:54,275

            to be aftershocks

    into the streets.           

1192
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,049
      But you're leaving.       

1193
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:02,950
         I have a son.          

1194
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,352
      I have to find him.       

1195
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:07,422
Of course.                      

1196
01:12:07,456 --> 01:12:10,291
Doing something is better       
      than doing nothing.       

1197
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,126
      I have a little dog.      

1198

     His name is low rider.     

1199
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:16,631
        If you find him,        
  would you take care of him?   

1200
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:19,100
    He's hiding, or...          
  Or he got out or something.   

1201
01:12:19,134 --> 01:12:20,835
Thank you.                      

1202

                I can't go back 
                in my place.    

1204

                I have to come  
                with you.       

1205
01:12:29,778 --> 01:12:31,446
    I can't stay here alone.    

1206
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,448
         I don't think          
        that's possible         

1207

there's no way to...

And give me                     
a phone that works.             

1250
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:42,703
    Okay, as far as we know     

1251
01:15:42,738 --> 01:15:45,006
      Incidents of looting      
    and mayhem are sporadic.    

1252
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,173
Yeah, well,                     
that'll change.                 

1253
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,975
Trying to get a reading         
on how many beat cops           

1254
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:49,110
    There are on the island.    

1255
01:15:49,144 --> 01:15:51,212
And we're checking to see       
  if queens is in any position  

1256
01:15:51,246 --> 01:15:52,346
To give us a d.S.U. Truck.      

1257
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:53,347
                I don't know how

1258
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:54,482
                We're going     
                to get it here. 

1259
01:15:54,516 --> 01:15:56,717
      Well, you'd better        
      think of something.       

1260
01:15:56,752 --> 01:15:58,486
 This is company 11, go ahead.  

1261
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,421
Okay, hand carry if you have to.

1262
01:16:00,455 --> 01:16:02,990
  11, I want you to roll hose   
        down 8th avenue         

1263
01:16:03,025 --> 01:16:04,825
 All the way down to west 14th. 

1264
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:06,861
          27, link up.          

1265
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:08,095
      Go all the way west       

1266
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:09,630
      Until you can draft       
        from the hudson.        

1267
01:16:09,665 --> 01:16:10,665
          Roger that.           

1268
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:13,301
      I need a fire boat.       

1269
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:15,036
    Pier 59, chelsea.           

1270
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:18,539
  Mayor, I need those streets   
            cleared.            

1271
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:21,242
      You heard the chief,      
        logistics.              

1272
01:16:21,276 --> 01:16:22,510
  Henry, I want the bulldozers  

1273
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:24,679
From all the construction sites 
        in new york city        

1274
01:16:24,713 --> 01:16:26,013
 On the street within an hour.  

1275
01:16:26,048 --> 01:16:28,716
Mayor, white house              
on the satellite phone.         

1276
01:16:29,885 --> 01:16:31,152
         Mayor lincoln.         

1277
01:16:38,994 --> 01:16:42,897
      My mom is not going       
 to be able to cope with this.  

1278
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:47,635
We will find                    
your mother.                    

1279
01:16:47,669 --> 01:16:48,970
                    Yeah, but...

1280
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:51,672
            How do I tell her   
            about my dad?       

1281
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:55,710
You will find a way             
when the time comes.            

1282
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:59,547
                    Who are you?

1283
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:02,350
Me?                             

1284
01:17:02,384 --> 01:17:03,584
I am nicholai.                  

1285
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:04,719
                        I know. 

1286
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:12,793
Diane, it could be long time    
to find drinking water.         

1287
01:17:12,828 --> 01:17:14,862
Better save.                    

1288
01:17:14,896 --> 01:17:16,664
            How long is long?   

1289
01:17:19,768 --> 01:17:21,268
Don't know.                     

1290
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:24,305
                    I'm sorry.  

1291
01:17:24,339 --> 01:17:25,706
                You're right.   

1292
01:17:26,742 --> 01:17:28,409
            I wasn't thinking.  

1293
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:38,119
      Ladies and gentlemen      

1294
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:41,622
  Washington just declared us   
      a federal disaster.       

1295
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:44,125
    Fema, urban search          
        and rescue teams        

1296
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:47,128
Will be arriving at floyd       
bennett field in brooklyn       

1297
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:49,063
    And taken by helicopter     
         to manhattan.          

1298
01:17:49,097 --> 01:17:50,097
     Let the tv crews know      

1299
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:51,432
Where they'll be landing.       

1300
01:17:51,466 --> 01:17:53,000
Whoa, wait a minute here.       

1301
01:17:53,035 --> 01:17:55,536
        I got damn near         
        16,000 men out there.   

1302
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:57,972
    Now that's not counting     
your local emergency units      

1303
01:17:58,006 --> 01:17:59,740
Struggling with this thing      
        right now               

1304
01:17:59,775 --> 01:18:02,443
                Fema shows up   
                and suddenly    
                it's a photo op?

1305
01:18:02,477 --> 01:18:03,878
You're out of line.             

1306
01:18:03,912 --> 01:18:04,945
         Let me guess.          

1307
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:08,349
    This stuff replays          
  around election time, right?  

1308
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:09,550
    For all we know, ahearn     

1309
01:18:09,584 --> 01:18:11,652
      There'll be no city       
      to hold an election.      

1310
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:12,720
    My point exactly.           

1311
01:18:12,754 --> 01:18:13,888
I'm calling for cameras         

1312
01:18:13,922 --> 01:18:16,624
Because the footage             
might give people hope.         

1313
01:18:16,658 --> 01:18:17,892
Hope!                           

1314
01:18:17,926 --> 01:18:19,794
Because they see                
the entire country              

1315
01:18:19,828 --> 01:18:21,095
Mobilizing to help us.          

1316
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:26,434
Elizabeth.                      

1317
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:32,506
Elizabeth,                      
you all right?                  

1318
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:34,675
        Yeah, as well as can    
        be expected, I guess.   

1319
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:35,843
                    Thank you.  

1320
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:37,211
    Take this.                  
                    Thanks.     

1321
01:18:37,245 --> 01:18:38,279
        No, I'm fine, thanks.   

1322
01:18:38,313 --> 01:18:39,847
How's mark ross?                

1323
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:40,981
                    He, uh...   

1324
01:18:41,016 --> 01:18:43,117
                Mark didn't     
                make it, sir.   

1325
01:18:45,821 --> 01:18:47,021
Okay, okay, um...               

1326
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:49,690
Look, you're going to have to   
take over emergency management. 

1327
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:50,891
                    Yes, sir.   

1328
01:18:50,926 --> 01:18:53,260
This is chief ahearn,           
from the fire department.       

1329
01:18:53,295 --> 01:18:54,361
Pleased to meet you.            

1330
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:55,696
Elizabeth perez.                

1331
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:58,332
She's going to be director      
of emergency management.        

1332
01:18:58,366 --> 01:18:59,567
Elizabeth...                    

1333
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:01,435
I have every confidence         
in you.                         

1334
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:03,204
                Thank you, sir. 

1335
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:05,506
Sorry to see you                
under these circumstances.      

1336
01:19:07,309 --> 01:19:09,009
Would you like                  
some water?                     

1337
01:19:09,044 --> 01:19:10,778
          Yes, please.          

1338
01:19:10,812 --> 01:19:12,680
From what I see out there       

1339
01:19:12,714 --> 01:19:15,449
        We've got a lot         
     of improvising to do.      

1340
01:19:15,484 --> 01:19:16,751
  All right, let's prioritize.  

1341
01:19:16,785 --> 01:19:17,785
                        Okay.   

1342
01:19:17,819 --> 01:19:19,053
                    Injured--   

1343
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:21,388
    Major hospitals will be     
      on back-up generator      

1344
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:22,757
        With enough fuel        
         for 48 hours.          

1345
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:24,358
        But there are--         
            thanks--            

1346
01:19:24,392 --> 01:19:26,494
    Lots of people lined up     
around the blocks already.      

1347
01:19:26,528 --> 01:19:28,529
        Are there any streets   
        clear yet?              

1348
01:19:28,563 --> 01:19:30,431
One trunk down each side        
of manhattan.                   

1349
01:19:30,465 --> 01:19:32,299
             Good.              

1350
01:19:32,334 --> 01:19:34,869
             Um...              

1351
01:19:34,903 --> 01:19:37,538
          Let's set up          
      an outdoor infirmary      

1352
01:19:37,572 --> 01:19:39,507
    Right here in the park.     

1353
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:42,076
  We can pull medical supplies  
from the nearby hospitals       

1354
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:43,244
         We can buses.          

1355
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:45,980
  We can get military vehicles  
    to shuttle the victims.     

1356
01:19:47,015 --> 01:19:49,717
        It'll be easier         
 to dispense food rations, too. 

1357
01:19:49,751 --> 01:19:52,453
     We've got to let fema      
    medical assistant teams     

1358
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:53,754
            Know where we are.  

1359
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:55,156
                    Oh, yeah.   

1360
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:58,692
    We've got to have           
  a priority on potable water.  

1361
01:19:58,727 --> 01:19:59,994
    Is there a curfew?          

1362
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:02,096
      Tonight, nightfall.       

1363
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:05,266
 Well, we've got to have access 
         to a stadium.          

1364
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:08,502
    And we've got to, uh...     

1365
01:20:08,537 --> 01:20:10,738
Get as many refrigerated trucks 
        as we can find.         

1366
01:20:14,376 --> 01:20:16,143
         For the dead.          

1367
01:20:18,346 --> 01:20:19,980
Careful here.                   

1368
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:21,282
Watch yourself.                 

1369
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:28,656
    ( <i>loud rumbling</i> )           

1370
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:29,690
          What's that?          

1371
01:20:29,724 --> 01:20:31,392
I don't know.                   

1372
01:20:36,698 --> 01:20:38,199
         ( <i>screaming</i> )          

1373
01:20:42,604 --> 01:20:43,637
Come on.

We've got to keep going.        

1376
01:20:48,076 --> 01:20:51,812
      We just got a report      
of a 50-foot water geyser.      

1377
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:54,148
    Crew's on its way           
        to cap it.              

1378
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:57,218
That would be a trunk line      
      right off the main.       

1379
01:20:57,252 --> 01:20:58,385
Exactly, uh...                  

1380
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:00,921
We're talking hundreds of       
 thousands of gallons of water. 

1381
01:21:00,956 --> 01:21:02,723
And that's the only place       
         it showed up.          

1382
01:21:02,757 --> 01:21:04,091

1383
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:05,960
                Right down...   

1384
01:21:05,994 --> 01:21:08,696
                Into the subway.

1385
01:21:22,677 --> 01:21:25,446
    This station's been hit     
          pretty bad.           

1386
01:21:26,815 --> 01:21:30,351
Doesn't look like there's       
      any way out of here.      

1387
01:21:31,853 --> 01:21:33,988
 There's got to be a staircase  
     along here somewhere.      

1388
01:21:34,022 --> 01:21:37,791
            No, it looks like   
            they're all blocked.

1389
01:21:37,826 --> 01:21:40,060
I'm really cold.                
What are we going to do?        

1390
01:21:40,095 --> 01:21:41,328
      It'll be all right.       

1391
01:21:41,363 --> 01:21:44,365
                    We have to  
                    keep moving.

1392
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:46,400
    Find an emergency exit.     

1393
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:48,168
        Another station.        

1394
01:21:48,203 --> 01:21:49,370
        Something.

  please report to first aid.

         There are more         
      and more casualties.      

1404

                Joseph, have it 
                cordoned off.   

1411
01:24:23,258 --> 01:24:26,026

1415

Why, for god's sakes?           

1416

        felt the quake.         

1417
01:24:34,502 --> 01:24:35,702

Mr. Mayor,                      
we can now transmit             

1423
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:43,377

of frequencies.                 

1424

All right. The first priority is
        elizabeth perez

01:24:45,613 --> 01:24:46,880
And emergency management.       

1426
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:49,149
    Then begin broadcasting     
     all available options

    and shelter for tonight.

on distribution of radios?      

1429
01:24:53,788 --> 01:24:56,857

at a staging area in new jersey.

     if nobody can hear it?

1436

At every six-block interval.

to port authority?

        100 buses

but the remaining problem       

1441
01:25:25,587 --> 01:25:26,887
         Is the street.         

1442
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:30,124
We'll worry about the streets   
being cleared.                  

1443
01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:32,693
Just get those buses            
ready to roll.                  

1444
01:25:32,727 --> 01:25:33,827
        Okay. All right.        

1445
01:25:33,862 --> 01:25:35,896
    Well, then let's move on    
        to the armories.        

1446
01:25:39,501 --> 01:25:42,035

    prince and eighth.          

1447
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:45,305
     Shouldn't be more than     
  20 minutes to get to eighth.  

1448
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:46,406
                I don't know.

if you want.

1626
01:34:32,433 --> 01:34:34,167
      Out of all the ways       
     I thought I might die

Starving to death               
in a stupid church.

         You want some?         

1635

    No. I lost my appetite.

      that hungry either.

     to see a newborn babe

          With no one

    I don't know what           
        god has in mind         

1658

        Where you'll be safe.

        Maybe your son's there.

No, you don't understand.

01:38:57,264 --> 01:38:58,865
Kind of late                    
for sightseeing.                

1704
01:38:58,899 --> 01:39:00,833
    Actually, I, uh...

 I have a wife and child there. 

1709
01:39:10,544 --> 01:39:12,645
     I don't envy you that.     

1710
01:39:13,881 --> 01:39:15,181
 Look, if you don't own a boat  

1711
01:39:15,215 --> 01:39:16,716
         Maybe you know         
    somebody who does.          

1712
01:39:18,252 --> 01:39:20,586
    Probably got coast guard    
      patrolling all over.      

1713
01:39:20,621 --> 01:39:23,256
  I'll pay whatever it takes,   
             okay?              

1714
01:39:27,761 --> 01:39:29,662

supposed to happen?             

1715
01:39:29,697 --> 01:39:32,432
                    Now.

      just sitting there.

                And I don't know
                where he is.    

1727
01:40:40,601 --> 01:40:42,335
Yes, ma'am; it's easy           
to lose somebody                

1728
01:40:42,369 --> 01:40:43,369
In a place this big.            

1729
01:40:43,404 --> 01:40:45,071
            No, he's not here-- 
            he wasn't even      

1730
01:40:45,105 --> 01:40:46,406
                With me during  
                the quake.      

1731
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:48,408
Where was he when               
you last saw him?               

1732
01:40:49,376 --> 01:40:50,410
He was at his school.           

1733
01:40:50,444 --> 01:40:51,878
And I think maybe               
he's still there.               

1734
01:40:51,912 --> 01:40:53,413
Now, I know that                
there's a curfew.

01:40:58,018 --> 01:40:59,152
No, he's a little boy.          

1739
01:40:59,186 --> 01:41:01,087
If I don't find him...          
I don't know...                 

1740
01:41:01,121 --> 01:41:02,355
                See that table  
                over there?     

1741
01:41:02,389 --> 01:41:04,624
They've got a list of kids      
    looking for their folks.    

1742
01:41:04,658 --> 01:41:05,958
    Now, with a little luck     

1743
01:41:05,993 --> 01:41:07,994
                Maybe he's      
                already on it.  

1744
01:41:09,530 --> 01:41:12,398
              Man:              
Transport, pick up at 8-5,      
            please.             

1745
01:41:17,137 --> 01:41:19,072
What about you?                 

1746
01:41:19,106 --> 01:41:21,507
                Russian blood   
                is very thick.  

1747
01:41:24,111 --> 01:41:26,412
Karvoskya,                      
what's in the box?              

1748
01:41:26,447 --> 01:41:28,748
                        Uh...   

1749
01:41:28,782 --> 01:41:30,450
You don't have                  
to tell me.                     

1750
01:41:31,618 --> 01:41:34,454
            No, no, I show you. 

1751
01:41:44,565 --> 01:41:46,499
    This is my family.          

1752
01:41:49,136 --> 01:41:50,770
My mother...                    

1753
01:41:50,804 --> 01:41:52,605
Father...                       

1754
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:54,107
Two brothers.                   

1755
01:41:54,141 --> 01:41:56,642
            Oh, you look just   
            like your brothers. 

1756
01:41:57,678 --> 01:42:00,179
Like twins,                     
only three.                     

1757
01:42:00,214 --> 01:42:02,482
                Where are       
                they all now?   

1758
01:42:08,856 --> 01:42:11,290
         My... Parents'         

1759
01:42:11,325 --> 01:42:13,326
Wedding rings.                  

1760
01:42:21,635 --> 01:42:23,903
My brothers'.                   

1761
01:42:23,937 --> 01:42:27,140
        One each.               

1762
01:42:27,174 --> 01:42:29,809
Little brother's                
flight jacket.                  

1763
01:42:38,685 --> 01:42:41,120
                ( <i>quietly</i> ):    
                What happened?  

1764
01:42:42,389 --> 01:42:44,023
          In russia...          

1765
01:42:44,057 --> 01:42:46,993
    There were many crises.     

1766
01:42:47,027 --> 01:42:49,896
Like this, only different.      

1767
01:42:50,898 --> 01:42:53,533
     I'm sorry... I feel...     

1768
01:42:53,567 --> 01:42:54,534
                I didn't know.  

1769
01:42:54,568 --> 01:42:56,235
        It is the past.         

1770
01:43:03,644 --> 01:43:05,645
         I miss my dad.         

1771
01:43:08,582 --> 01:43:10,583
         I miss my mom.         

1772
01:43:13,654 --> 01:43:15,621
    Everything I know           
         could be gone.         

1773
01:43:15,656 --> 01:43:17,190
    We will find her.           

1774
01:43:17,224 --> 01:43:19,525
     Help her in her grief.     

1775
01:43:28,035 --> 01:43:32,338
      I grew up two blocks      
      from the guggenheim.      

1776
01:43:32,372 --> 01:43:35,808
  My mother and I would visit   
    once a month or so          

1777
01:43:35,842 --> 01:43:38,477
      And then I got older      
    and we quit going.          

1778
01:43:38,512 --> 01:43:40,279
        I got too busy.         

1779
01:43:42,115 --> 01:43:43,349
                What a shame.   

1780
01:43:43,383 --> 01:43:46,652
          Do not think          
      about these things.       

1781
01:43:46,687 --> 01:43:50,957
     You count on your life     
 going a certain way, you know? 

1782
01:43:50,991 --> 01:43:53,593
    And then all of a sudden    
it isn't like that at all.      

1783
01:43:56,630 --> 01:44:00,233
  Of all the things I could've  
      imagined for my life      

1784
01:44:00,267 --> 01:44:02,668
I never would have dreamt       
            of this.            

1785
01:44:02,703 --> 01:44:07,707
    Maybe there is some good    
    in having nothing.          

1786
01:44:07,741 --> 01:44:12,612
     I got nothing to give      
     but what I have inside     

1787
01:44:12,646 --> 01:44:17,383
  And I have never had to say,  
        "what a shame."         

1788
01:44:20,654 --> 01:44:22,655
Go to sleep.                    

1789
01:44:54,321 --> 01:44:56,489
    ( <i>muffled conversation</i> )    

1790
01:44:56,523 --> 01:45:00,626
         Man over p.A.:         
 ...Please remove your vehicles 
from area six after you...      

1791
01:45:00,661 --> 01:45:04,597
          Well, it's not exactly
          tavern on the green.  

1792
01:45:04,631 --> 01:45:07,767
  Nothing a bottle of good red  
      couldn't help, huh?       

1793
01:45:10,837 --> 01:45:14,173
    Okay, what have we got?     

1794
01:45:15,742 --> 01:45:19,912
 Well, um, we're barely keeping 
  up with what's needed, sir.   

1795
01:45:19,946 --> 01:45:22,448
     The problem of rodents     
      spreading disease--       

1796
01:45:22,482 --> 01:45:23,816
     It's bound to increase     

1797
01:45:23,850 --> 01:45:26,185
        The longer we're        
      without sanitation.       

1798
01:45:26,219 --> 01:45:27,720
                  Not to mention
                  bodies        

1799
01:45:27,754 --> 01:45:30,489
                 Decomposing in 
                 places that we 
                 can't get into.

1800
01:45:30,524 --> 01:45:32,958
        Ahearn:                 
        Some of the fires are   
        still out of control.   

1801
01:45:32,993 --> 01:45:35,761
  We're rerouting to build up   
 pressure in the affected areas 

1802
01:45:35,796 --> 01:45:38,397
            But I think we're   
            going to gain       
            from now on.        

1803
01:45:38,432 --> 01:45:40,599
Man:                            
Priority message                
from fema, ms. Perez.           

1804
01:45:41,968 --> 01:45:44,003
                    I'll be     
                    right back. 

1805
01:45:46,707 --> 01:45:49,542
    This is patched in          
from the state department.      

1806
01:45:49,576 --> 01:45:52,645
        He insists              
    on talking to you.          

1807
01:45:52,679 --> 01:45:55,247
Mayor lincoln.                  

1808
01:46:01,922 --> 01:46:03,622
         Listen to me.          

1809
01:46:03,657 --> 01:46:06,025
    I've got thousands          
      of new york citizens      

1810
01:46:06,059 --> 01:46:09,061
    Trapped under what were     
  once their homes and offices  

1811
01:46:09,096 --> 01:46:10,896
Not to mention thousands of kids

1812
01:46:10,931 --> 01:46:12,998
    Under the wreckage          
    of their schools!           

1813
01:46:16,603 --> 01:46:18,571
        The u.N...              
     Yes, the ambassador...     

1814
01:46:18,605 --> 01:46:19,972
    Yes, I understand.          

1815
01:46:20,006 --> 01:46:21,474
          Priorities?           

1816
01:46:22,743 --> 01:46:24,176
      Priorities are <i>mine</i>       

1817

To call, sir.                   

1818
01:46:25,979 --> 01:46:27,780
 And that I will continue to do 

1819
01:46:27,814 --> 01:46:30,383
    Until they haul me          
    out of here feet first!     

1820
01:46:32,953 --> 01:46:36,188
Man! Everyone thinks            
their crapola                   

1821
01:46:36,223 --> 01:46:37,623
Is most important.              

1822
01:46:37,657 --> 01:46:38,791
        I don't know.           

1823
01:46:38,825 --> 01:46:40,559
Maybe it's                      
unavoidable.                    

1824
01:46:40,594 --> 01:46:43,329
You know, we all                
get caught up                   
in our roles.                   

1825
01:46:43,363 --> 01:46:49,101
Renegade fire chief             
versus big city boss mayor.     

1826
01:46:51,238 --> 01:46:53,806
I called you things             

1827
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:57,643
And I never even                
knew who you were.              

1828
01:47:00,914 --> 01:47:04,550
                I believe       
                you called me   

1829
01:47:04,584 --> 01:47:07,920
  An opportunistic con artist.  

1830
01:47:09,523 --> 01:47:12,458
    I regret that now.          

1831
01:47:12,492 --> 01:47:15,628
                    I called you
                    a moron.    

1832
01:47:15,662 --> 01:47:16,796
      Said you didn't know      

1833
01:47:16,830 --> 01:47:18,931
         The difference         
    between fire and smoke--    

1834
01:47:18,965 --> 01:47:21,300
    Among other things          
    that didn't get printed.    

1835
01:47:21,334 --> 01:47:24,036
    That statement reflected    
    more on me than on you.     

1836
01:47:25,872 --> 01:47:29,542
             The job does get in
             the way sometimes. 

1837
01:47:31,611 --> 01:47:35,581
      My wife's been dead       
         over a decade.         

1838
01:47:37,083 --> 01:47:41,387
                 But I can still
                 see her face in
                 my daughter's. 

1839
01:47:41,421 --> 01:47:49,628
      If anyone's kept me human,
      it's been her.            

1840
01:47:52,232 --> 01:47:54,834
            You were right      
            about me, ahearn.   

1841
01:47:54,868 --> 01:47:58,037
            I'm a politician.   

1842
01:47:58,071 --> 01:48:02,708
                By nature an    
                opportunistic   
                con artist.     

1843
01:48:02,742 --> 01:48:06,612
      But it was my family      
      who raised the bar.       

1844
01:48:06,646 --> 01:48:10,382
    Set the standards           
    for me to live by.          

1845
01:48:13,587 --> 01:48:18,390
 I may be left with very little 
     when this is all over.     

1846
01:48:18,425 --> 01:48:24,897
        But I thank them        
that I can sleep at night.      

1847
01:48:28,935 --> 01:48:31,804
You and me, we fought           

1848
01:48:31,838 --> 01:48:34,773
Over money... Pride.            

1849
01:48:37,878 --> 01:48:41,313
Damn, I wish we could           
have done better.               

1850
01:48:42,816 --> 01:48:45,150
            We will.            

1851
01:48:46,386 --> 01:48:47,853
              Man:              
         Chief ahearn!          

1852
01:48:50,290 --> 01:48:52,658
    Search and rescue teams     
         at grant high.         

1853
01:48:52,692 --> 01:48:54,693
 They've found some survivors.

01:57:08,321 --> 01:57:13,525
And yet, I think about him      

1977
01:57:13,559 --> 01:57:16,528
     Every day of my life.      

1978
01:57:16,562 --> 01:57:22,734
I wonder what                   
he might have been              

1979
01:57:22,769 --> 01:57:24,770
Had he been able                

1980
01:57:24,804 --> 01:57:28,673
To hang on to                   
the gift of life.               

1981
01:57:32,011 --> 01:57:35,480
      I named him clayton.      

1982
01:57:38,918 --> 01:57:44,156
             If...              
  If you would carry his name   

1983
01:57:44,190 --> 01:57:47,159
      It would give me...       

1984
01:57:47,193 --> 01:57:49,327
             Peace.             

1985
01:57:53,633 --> 01:57:56,001
            Clayton.            

1986
01:57:56,035 --> 01:58:00,605
        God has a reason        

1987
01:58:00,640 --> 01:58:04,076
For everything he does, clayton.

1988
01:58:05,912 --> 01:58:08,346
A damn miracle is what we need. 

1989
01:58:10,283 --> 01:58:13,718
We had to pick our way,         
inch by inch                    

1990
01:58:13,753 --> 01:58:15,687
Shoring up as we go.            

1991
01:58:15,721 --> 01:58:18,356
The infrared and videocams      

1992
01:58:18,391 --> 01:58:20,225
          Have helped.          

1993
01:58:20,259 --> 01:58:22,928
    So have the dogs.           

1994
01:58:22,962 --> 01:58:26,398
We have a pretty                
good idea                       

1995
01:58:26,432 --> 01:58:28,266
  Of where the survivors are.

                Okay, let's go. 

1999
01:58:42,415 --> 01:58:44,749
We got nearly 50 kids           
out of the gym                  

2000
01:58:44,784 --> 01:58:48,086
And even more out of what       
was left of the cafeteria       

2001
01:58:48,121 --> 01:58:50,288
    But these classrooms...     

2002
01:58:50,323 --> 01:58:53,125
 A lot of kids didn't make it.  

2003
01:58:55,995 --> 01:58:58,296
We got most                     
of this equipment               

2004
01:58:58,331 --> 01:59:01,266
Through a breakaway             
in the wall.                    

2005
01:59:02,435 --> 01:59:04,870
Some in pieces                  
and then reassembled.           

2006
01:59:10,076 --> 01:59:12,878
More down this way.             

2007
01:59:12,912 --> 01:59:15,013
We've got three                 
kids in here.                   

2008
01:59:15,047 --> 01:59:16,548
Two boys and a girl.            

2009
01:59:16,582 --> 01:59:18,250
They got spunk though.          

2010
01:59:18,284 --> 01:59:19,751
They're hanging in.

2013
01:59:24,290 --> 01:59:25,590
                        Where?  

2014
01:59:25,625 --> 01:59:26,825
    They're right in here.      

2015
01:59:26,859 --> 01:59:29,227

            You're lucky you    
            didn't get that far.

2037

            There's a curfew.   

2038

            Let us escort you

over that                       

2413
02:22:25,503 --> 02:22:26,770

And your mother is alive.

who came in with her            

2467

He's in the hall.               

2468
02:27:11,055 --> 02:27:13,056
            She was my mother.

She was a tough lady.           

2470

I didn't think                  
she was gonna die.              

2471
02:27:32,944 --> 02:27:34,911
        I want to, uh...        

2472

              Man:              
  The whole thing's caved in.   

2591
02:37:14,124 --> 02:37:16,058
    Let's get a crew            
    to cordon it off.           

2592
02:37:16,093 --> 02:37:17,059
                            Hey!

2593
02:37:17,094 --> 02:37:18,361
              Hey!              

2594
02:37:18,395 --> 02:37:19,629
             Hey...             

2595
02:37:19,663 --> 02:37:21,431
There's people down here!       

2596
02:37:21,465 --> 02:37:22,432
            Hang on!            

2597
02:37:22,466 --> 02:37:24,434
    We'll get you out!          

2598
02:37:31,608 --> 02:37:34,277
        All right, here's       
        what we're going to do. 

2599
02:37:34,311 --> 02:37:39,982
            You... Are going    
            to have to help me. 

2600
02:37:40,017 --> 02:37:42,819
                        You...  

2601
02:37:42,853 --> 02:37:45,655
    Are going to jump to me.    

2602
02:37:45,689 --> 02:37:47,590
             Jump?              

2603
02:37:47,624 --> 02:37:49,525
              Me?               

2604
02:37:49,560 --> 02:37:51,093
            I know it's scary   

2605
02:37:51,128 --> 02:37:53,863
                But I know that 
                you can do it.  

2606
02:37:56,467 --> 02:37:59,635
  Danny, I know you're scared   
     and I understand why.      

2607
02:37:59,670 --> 02:38:01,971
    We had an accident          
      and you got hurt....      

2608
02:38:02,005 --> 02:38:02,972
              Mom!              

2609
02:38:03,006 --> 02:38:04,640
            But that was then.  

2610
02:38:04,675 --> 02:38:10,079
          Now, danny,           
      you have to trust me      

2611
02:38:10,113 --> 02:38:11,714
    Like I trust you.           

2612
02:38:11,748 --> 02:38:16,886
                And we are going
                to be okay.     

2613
02:38:16,920 --> 02:38:19,589
         I promise you.         

2614
02:38:19,623 --> 02:38:20,823
     We're going to be fine     

2615
02:38:20,858 --> 02:38:23,125
Because I will not have it      
         any other way.         

2616
02:38:32,970 --> 02:38:34,203
             Okay.              

2617
02:38:34,238 --> 02:38:38,307
          Good. Good.           

2618
02:38:38,342 --> 02:38:39,809
        Okay, now.              

2619
02:38:39,843 --> 02:38:44,847
        Start back there        
          and on three          

2620
02:38:44,882 --> 02:38:47,450
      You're going to run       
        and jump to me.         

2621
02:38:47,484 --> 02:38:49,418
     You can do this, okay?     

2622
02:38:49,453 --> 02:38:51,587
             One...             

2623
02:38:56,293 --> 02:38:57,627

2624
02:39:02,566 --> 02:39:03,799
             Three!             

2625
02:39:23,420 --> 02:39:24,387
        I got you, baby.        

2626
02:39:24,421 --> 02:39:26,222
        We're all right.        
        We're all right.        

2627

2629

Where's danny?

                    You're okay,
                    you're okay.

2633
02:40:34,891 --> 02:40:36,859
Low rider!                      

2634
02:40:36,893 --> 02:40:38,094
How you doing, buddy?           

2635
02:40:38,128 --> 02:40:42,031
I was looking for you           
at the apartment.               

2636
02:40:42,065 --> 02:40:44,467
Thought I'd lost everything.    

2637
02:40:44,501 --> 02:40:46,102
Oh, god.                        

2638
02:40:51,108 --> 02:40:52,975
        Not everything.         

2639
02:40:55,979 --> 02:40:57,847
        Not everything.         

2640
02:41:29,513 --> 02:41:31,280
Call me back.                   

2641
02:41:31,314 --> 02:41:32,281
                    Can I, uh...

2642
02:41:32,315 --> 02:41:34,283
                Can I talk to   
                you a minute?   

2643
02:41:45,762 --> 02:41:50,666
    This, uh, young man, he,    
    uh, tried to save a life.   

2644
02:41:50,701 --> 02:41:53,436
    He thinks it was his fault. 

2645
02:41:53,470 --> 02:41:56,772
                Somehow if he   
                were a, uh...   

2646
02:41:56,807 --> 02:41:58,641
                A better person 

2647
02:41:58,675 --> 02:42:02,845
        He could have changed   
        the outcome.            

2648
02:42:05,649 --> 02:42:08,417
    I thought you might, um...  

2649
02:42:08,452 --> 02:42:11,687
        You might... You might  
        be able to talk to him. 

2650
02:42:19,963 --> 02:42:22,031
I'll give it a try.             

2651

    This is jillian parnell

Dignitaries and reporters

        At the <i>intrepid</i>         

2655
02:42:51,528 --> 02:42:53,796
    To hear national, state     
    and civic leaders

02:42:53,830 --> 02:42:55,664

     the first anniversary      

2657
02:42:55,699 --> 02:42:57,900
  Of the tragic new york city   
          earthquake.           

2658
02:42:57,934 --> 02:43:00,736
         As devastating         
  as this catastrophe has been  

2659
02:43:00,771 --> 02:43:02,271
 A remarkable fact has emerged  

2660
02:43:02,305 --> 02:43:03,939
        From the rubble         
    of this disaster.           

2661
02:43:03,974 --> 02:43:06,375
          New yorkers,          
     so often characterized     

2662
02:43:06,409 --> 02:43:07,810
      As cold and uncaring      

2663
02:43:07,844 --> 02:43:10,613
      Have joined together      
      in dramatic numbers       

2664
02:43:10,647 --> 02:43:12,214
     To rebuild their city.     

2665
02:43:12,249 --> 02:43:13,649
            Ahearn:             
        A year ago today        

2666
02:43:13,683 --> 02:43:16,485
    In the early hours          
      after the earthquake      

2667
02:43:16,520 --> 02:43:19,855
         I found myself         
working side by side with a man 

2668
02:43:19,890 --> 02:43:24,627
  Who I'd already come to see   
 as my political foe, my enemy. 

2669
02:43:24,661 --> 02:43:27,863
Then after the earthquake       

2670
02:43:27,898 --> 02:43:31,934
I watched him suffer his losses 
        along with mine.        

2671
02:43:31,968 --> 02:43:35,738
    I watched him persevere     
         for this city          

2672
02:43:35,772 --> 02:43:40,109
  Through his pain and anguish  

2673
02:43:40,143 --> 02:43:45,114
     And I realized that he     
  was no more or less than I--  

2674
02:43:45,148 --> 02:43:47,750
      Just a man like me--      

2675
02:43:47,784 --> 02:43:50,252
         Trying to save         
what was left of his home.      

2676
02:43:50,287 --> 02:43:55,758
  That enemy became my friend   

2677
02:43:55,792 --> 02:44:00,830
      And I am very proud       
 to introduce to you my friend  

2678
02:44:00,864 --> 02:44:03,666
        The mayor

2681
02:44:17,080 --> 02:44:24,687
     I speak to all of you      
  who have chosen to stay here  

2682
02:44:24,721 --> 02:44:28,157
         And I must say         
    that it is fitting          

2683
02:44:28,191 --> 02:44:35,497
    That we are on our feet     
 once again, standing together.

     <i>We stand side by side,</i>

 <i>The greatest city in the world!</i>

2686
02:44:48,278 --> 02:44:53,015
  Much will never be replaced.  

2687
02:44:53,049 --> 02:45:00,956
  And there's an empty spot in  
 everyone's heart for all those 

2688
02:45:00,991 --> 02:45:10,766
  Who can never be seen, felt   
or held close ever again.       

2689
02:45:10,800 --> 02:45:13,836
    But we must seize           
        the opportunity         

2690
02:45:13,870 --> 02:45:18,040
  <i>To rebuild ourselves as well.</i> 

2691

       <i>to make a new life</i>       

2698
02:45:40,931 --> 02:45:47,136
