1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:06:39,047
- Hi, Sarge.
- Al.

2
00:06:39,047 --> 00:06:40,854
What are you doing up at this hour?

3
00:06:40,854 --> 00:06:43,912
- Night shift.
- Want the usual?

4
00:06:43,913 --> 00:06:46,485
Just some milk.

5
00:06:46,485 --> 00:06:52,939
How’s McQ? Haven't seen him lately.

6
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:55,997
You know, Lon and his boat.
He's living on it.

7
00:06:55,998 --> 00:07:01,654
How’s the gut?

8
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,884
It's not bad.

9
00:07:03,884 --> 00:07:06,361
Good. I got something cooking out back.

10
00:07:06,361 --> 00:07:08,001
- You need anything, give a holler.
- Right.

11
00:07:08,001 --> 00:08:17,564
Hello.

12
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:23,340
Nuts.

13
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:46,802
Yeah?

14
00:08:46,803 --> 00:08:49,247
Lon, J.C., did you hear?

15
00:08:49,248 --> 00:08:50,624
What?

16
00:08:50,624 --> 00:08:53,587
I'm sorry, Lon.
Stan went down this morning.

17
00:08:53,587 --> 00:09:00,440
- How bad?
- Shotgun in the back. He's in Harborview.

18
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,912
They're working on him there.

19
00:09:01,912 --> 00:09:03,966
Get Doc Merar over there.

20
00:09:03,967 --> 00:09:05,064
He's here.

21
00:09:05,064 --> 00:09:08,211
- Lois would like to see you.
- How's she doing?

22
00:09:08,211 --> 00:09:10,353
Gutsy. Holding up.

23
00:09:10,353 --> 00:09:12,519
Don't leave her alone.

24
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,804
Get a policewoman with her.

25
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:18,277
Now, what happened?

26
00:09:18,277 --> 00:09:20,539
Don't know. No witnesses.

27
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:23,717
Coffee shop guy heard the blast,
but didn't see a thing.

28
00:09:23,717 --> 00:09:28,282
Well, pull the package on Manny Santiago.

29
00:09:28,282 --> 00:09:32,416
I want an intelligence update on him,
and I want to see Stan's log.

30
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:36,671
Lon, two other officers got taken off, too.
Nine millimeter.

31
00:09:36,671 --> 00:09:39,753
Beat man named Hyatt
and Wally Johnson.

32
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:42,086
You know,
he works the night watch in Property.

33
00:09:42,086 --> 00:09:42,849
Yeah.

34
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,689
Kosterman thinks it's militants.

35
00:09:44,689 --> 00:09:45,468
See you.

36
00:09:45,468 --> 00:10:06,874
Hold it!

37
00:10:06,874 --> 00:11:05,717
- All right, now. Just stay back.
- Don't worry.

38
00:11:05,717 --> 00:11:25,808
You know him, Lieutenant?

39
00:11:25,808 --> 00:11:28,946
Patty Samuels. I know him.

40
00:11:28,946 --> 00:11:32,371
He's a hit man. He was waiting for me.

41
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:35,246
Pete, call the medical examiner.

42
00:11:35,247 --> 00:11:39,564
I better have that for the inquest,
Lieutenant.

43
00:11:39,564 --> 00:11:48,322
Hey, mister, that was a hell of a shot.

44
00:11:48,322 --> 00:11:50,472
I called the cops for you.

45
00:11:50,472 --> 00:11:51,625
Yeah, thanks.

46
00:11:51,626 --> 00:11:54,620
- You saw what happened?
- I saw you shoot him.

47
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,703
- And before that?
- I saw him blasting away at you.

48
00:11:57,703 --> 00:12:00,586
Good. Now I want you
to repeat what you saw...

49
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:03,549
just exactly the way it happened.

50
00:12:03,549 --> 00:12:06,982
- Hey, look, I don't wanna get involved.
- You already are.

51
00:12:06,982 --> 00:12:10,535
I have a tape recorder here.

52
00:12:10,535 --> 00:12:14,741
- Are you a cop?
- Yeah.

53
00:12:14,741 --> 00:12:17,489
Tell him what happened.
Officer, witness this.

54
00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:21,305
- Well, hell, I was just on my way to work...
- Name and address first.

55
00:12:21,305 --> 00:12:26,834
My name is James Carter,
and I live at 1131 N. 74th.

56
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:28,434
I was on my way to work this morning...

57
00:12:28,434 --> 00:12:31,142
When I saw this guy trying
to break into this car, some young kid.

58
00:12:31,142 --> 00:12:33,420
And then this guy came out
and chased him away...

59
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,279
and this other guy
started shooting at him, see.

60
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:40,453
And then the first guy blasted him.
You know, it was a hell of a shot.

61
00:12:40,454 --> 00:13:09,535
- Lon.
- Stan's tough, Lois.

62
00:13:09,535 --> 00:13:12,554
Don't forget it.

63
00:13:12,554 --> 00:13:19,342
- How bad?
- Critical.

64
00:13:19,342 --> 00:13:31,734
He liked to work, Lon.

65
00:13:31,734 --> 00:13:34,147
He thought being a cop was the greatest.

66
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,879
Well, he's still a cop,
and he's still gonna be one.

67
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,367
Sure.

68
00:13:38,368 --> 00:13:43,737
I'm not surprised he was shot.
I've been expecting it.

69
00:13:43,738 --> 00:13:47,218
All wives expect it these days,
don't you know that?

70
00:13:47,219 --> 00:13:50,580
Some crazy getting it off,
a radical doing his number.

71
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,555
We don't have to talk about it now.

72
00:13:52,555 --> 00:13:56,522
You've got some questions,
though, haven't you?

73
00:13:56,522 --> 00:13:58,895
Well, another time.

74
00:13:58,895 --> 00:14:03,117
It's all right.
Police work never stops, does it?

75
00:14:03,117 --> 00:14:06,686
I'm sorry, Lon.

76
00:14:06,686 --> 00:14:09,713
What do you wanna know?

77
00:14:09,713 --> 00:14:12,819
I know he was taking you
to a show last night.

78
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:14,443
How did he end up alone?

79
00:14:14,443 --> 00:14:16,027
He got a call.

80
00:14:16,027 --> 00:14:17,324
From whom?

81
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:21,546
I don't know, but it was important.
I could see his face.

82
00:14:21,547 --> 00:14:25,394
I could feel the tightening in his stomach.
You know how he was.

83
00:14:25,394 --> 00:14:28,580
- Did you hear what was said?
- Just pieces.

84
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,862
Well, I have a feeling it had something
to do with...

85
00:14:31,862 --> 00:14:34,419
the drive on against the dealers.
Just a feeling, that's all.

86
00:14:34,419 --> 00:14:37,549
The department dries up the city,
someone tries to dry up Stan.

87
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:39,316
Any names mentioned?

88
00:14:39,316 --> 00:14:42,439
Manny Santiago's, for instance?

89
00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:44,692
No.
I Would have remembered that for sure.

90
00:14:44,692 --> 00:14:49,464
Lois, I hate to,
but I'm just gonna to have to go.

91
00:14:49,465 --> 00:14:52,651
- Can I call somebody, a friend?
- Lon, don't baby me.

92
00:14:52,651 --> 00:14:56,546
I'm tough, too, remember?

93
00:14:56,546 --> 00:15:00,178
We'll all be back out
on that boat again soon.

94
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:01,205
You'll see.

95
00:15:01,205 --> 00:15:04,088
I'll be back as soon as I can.

96
00:15:04,088 --> 00:15:08,182
Calling Dr. Denon.

97
00:15:08,182 --> 00:15:29,937
Okay, let's go. Everybody out.

98
00:15:29,937 --> 00:15:47,926
Hold it down in there!

99
00:15:47,926 --> 00:15:50,993
- Good morning, Captain.
- Good morning.

100
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:55,199
I'm in the communications
center right now.

101
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,313
Yeah.

102
00:15:56,313 --> 00:16:01,046
Capt. Kosterman just walked in. Yes, sir.

103
00:16:01,046 --> 00:16:03,714
Chief, the mayor wants to see you.

104
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:05,895
- Tell him I'm on my way.
- He's on his way.

105
00:16:05,896 --> 00:16:07,886
All right, Ed. It's your ball game.

106
00:16:07,886 --> 00:16:10,968
I want your best people on this,
and I want quick action.

107
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:11,923
Yes, sir.

108
00:16:11,923 --> 00:16:15,404
This gets top priority.
If there's anything you need, just ask.

109
00:16:15,404 --> 00:16:16,629
I'll talk to you when I get back.

110
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:43,168
- How's Stan?
- He's hanging in there.

111
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,430
Boy, that's rough.

112
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,860
Homicide's looking for you.

113
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,153
They want your papers
on the Patty Samuels thing.

114
00:16:50,153 --> 00:16:54,550
And the captain's looking for you.
I think you've got him worried.

115
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,911
I put Stan's log on your desk
and the Santiago stuff.

116
00:16:57,912 --> 00:16:59,511
All the same.

117
00:16:59,512 --> 00:17:02,913
Arrested on a felony,
booked on a misdemeanor, released.

118
00:17:02,913 --> 00:17:05,924
- Yeah, he beats them all.
- Yeah.

119
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:09,325
I got us fight tickets for Thursday.

120
00:17:09,325 --> 00:17:11,850
Don't suppose we'll be needing them now.

121
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,864
My schedule will be busy.

122
00:17:13,864 --> 00:17:15,073
See you.

123
00:17:15,074 --> 00:17:18,634
You know, your Green Hornet
is an attractive nuisance.

124
00:17:18,634 --> 00:17:22,578
Someday, somebody's gonna rip it off.
Maybe me.

125
00:17:22,578 --> 00:17:25,501
You can have the payments, too.

126
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:35,342
- Capt. Kosterman Wants to see you.
- Dean.

127
00:17:35,342 --> 00:17:37,085
Have one of the girls type that up,
will you?

128
00:17:37,086 --> 00:17:44,719
Good morning, Frank.
Watching Kosterman's show?

129
00:17:44,719 --> 00:17:50,631
Sorry about Stan. How is he doing?

130
00:17:50,631 --> 00:17:53,291
- He's trying.
- Yeah.

131
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:58,366
Listen, if there's anything I can do for him,
for Lois, you'll let me know, will you?

132
00:17:58,366 --> 00:17:59,337
Thanks.

133
00:17:59,337 --> 00:18:06,229
Hey, McQ.
What is this asinine police crap?

134
00:18:06,229 --> 00:18:07,598
This is illegal arrest, man.

135
00:18:07,598 --> 00:18:09,772
This is unconstitutional,
and you damn well know it.

136
00:18:09,772 --> 00:18:12,280
This whole damn place is coming down,
you know that?

137
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,642
You pigs will be out of work,
but don't worry. We'll put you on welfare.

138
00:18:15,642 --> 00:18:17,058
That's all your stinking job is anyway.

139
00:18:17,058 --> 00:18:19,352
Come on, pig. Shoot me.

140
00:18:19,352 --> 00:18:22,928
Pull your piece and blow me up right here.
What's the matter? No guts?

141
00:18:22,928 --> 00:18:23,955
Chicken?

142
00:18:23,955 --> 00:18:26,049
God!

143
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:30,662
- What happened?
- He bumped into a chair.

144
00:18:30,662 --> 00:18:32,214
Chair?

145
00:18:32,214 --> 00:18:40,947
Good morning.

146
00:18:40,947 --> 00:18:45,273
- Almost got you.
- Close enough.

147
00:18:45,273 --> 00:18:51,305
- You know how I feel about this.
- I saw the hallways.

148
00:18:51,305 --> 00:18:54,725
Garbage.
The whole place smells like rotten cheese.

149
00:18:54,725 --> 00:18:56,450
We're gonna have to fumigate.

150
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:00,010
Ed, I think we should be
looking for something else.

151
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,650
I'm willing to look at anything.

152
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:06,095
But uniformed officers
shot down in the streets...

153
00:19:06,096 --> 00:19:09,409
that smells like radicals to me.

154
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:11,000
How about Patty Samuels
unloading on me?

155
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,223
That's not radical.

156
00:19:13,223 --> 00:19:15,465
Somebody thought Stan
had told me something.

157
00:19:15,465 --> 00:19:17,000
You're still harping on that Santiago thing.

158
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,453
Why not?

159
00:19:18,454 --> 00:19:21,329
Ed, I want this case.

160
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:27,639
No, not this one. I already put Burt on it.

161
00:19:27,639 --> 00:19:29,486
Stan and you are too close friends.

162
00:19:29,486 --> 00:19:31,278
You know how the department
feels about that.

163
00:19:31,278 --> 00:19:34,129
Emotional involvement
clouds clear judgment.

164
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:37,610
We both know all you have
to do is just say the word.

165
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,669
Well, I'm not saying it.

166
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:44,883
Lon, I know you.

167
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:48,109
I'm not gonna stand for you
making up your own rules.

168
00:19:48,109 --> 00:19:51,805
You're not gonna play
that Mickey Peters thing all over again.

169
00:19:51,805 --> 00:19:54,354
Peters was a hood, and everybody knew it.

170
00:19:54,354 --> 00:19:56,862
You weren't satisfied
With throwing him up on the roof.

171
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,175
You had to go up there
and throw him back down.

172
00:19:58,175 --> 00:20:00,206
Six months in the hospital...

173
00:20:00,206 --> 00:20:03,942
four lawyers screaming
about his civil rights.

174
00:20:03,942 --> 00:20:06,251
Well, it kept him off the street, didn't it?

175
00:20:06,251 --> 00:20:09,589
Yeah, and that's why I'm behind a desk
and you're taking orders from me.

176
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:10,392
Now, cool it.

177
00:20:10,392 --> 00:20:12,621
- Telephone, Captain.
- Thank you.

178
00:20:12,622 --> 00:20:17,322
Lon, cool it. Don't go away.

179
00:20:17,322 --> 00:20:19,416
I'm not finished yet.

180
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:26,922
Capt. Kosterman.

181
00:20:26,922 --> 00:20:31,893
No. All press inquiries
go to Chief Grogan's desk.

182
00:20:31,894 --> 00:20:35,781
That goes for lawyers, too.

183
00:20:35,781 --> 00:20:38,927
No, I don't want to talk to them.

184
00:20:38,927 --> 00:20:52,403
Capt. Bennerman, Internal Affairs.

185
00:20:52,403 --> 00:21:50,799
- Good morning, Mr. Santiago.
- Good morning.

186
00:21:50,799 --> 00:22:09,185
- Bob, I thought you'd be in court today.
- No, that's tomorrow.

187
00:22:09,185 --> 00:22:12,116
I was worried about the detective
who was shot last night.

188
00:22:12,116 --> 00:22:14,959
I'm afraid there may be repercussions.

189
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,014
Why should that be?

190
00:22:17,014 --> 00:22:20,295
I did not shoot him.

191
00:22:20,296 --> 00:22:25,354
I was on an overnight plane
from Mexico City.

192
00:22:25,355 --> 00:22:29,226
I know that, Manuel.
But it's my responsibility to caution you...

193
00:22:29,226 --> 00:22:32,014
about the possibility of harassment.

194
00:22:32,014 --> 00:22:36,623
- Good morning, Mr. Santiago.
- Good morning, Chris.

195
00:22:36,623 --> 00:22:41,080
Harassment. Such a nice lawyer's word.

196
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,238
Thank you, Bob. You're very conscientious.

197
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,093
How is he?

198
00:22:47,093 --> 00:22:48,486
Critical.

199
00:22:48,486 --> 00:22:51,872
Shame.

200
00:22:51,872 --> 00:24:03,363
...handling the modern supertankers,
eliminating the need for ships to travel.

201
00:24:03,363 --> 00:24:08,207
Detective Sgt. Stan Boyle died
late this morning...

202
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:09,345
at Harborview Hospital...

203
00:24:09,345 --> 00:24:12,108
victim of shotgun wounds
sustained early this morning.

204
00:24:12,108 --> 00:24:23,528
Boyle's assailant remains at large.
Police investigations continue.

205
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:26,403
This is your weather girl, Barbara Bogey...

206
00:24:26,403 --> 00:24:29,031
with today's report
on Seattle and vicinities.

207
00:24:29,031 --> 00:24:31,396
High today in the upper 50s.

208
00:24:31,396 --> 00:24:33,722
Low overnight 42.

209
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,549
Cloudy, clearing in the late afternoon.

210
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:37,814
What was just on the news?

211
00:24:37,815 --> 00:24:40,419
Sorry. I wasn't paying any attention.

212
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:45,605
The detective that got shot this morning,
he died.

213
00:24:45,605 --> 00:24:48,664
...400 miles
off the coast of British Columbia...

214
00:24:48,664 --> 00:24:52,057
with a cold front extending
west-southwest...

215
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:59,866
Two climbers from Washington state
are reported missing...

216
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:18,068
So, one less detective to worry about.

217
00:25:18,068 --> 00:25:20,657
Yeah, one less detective to worry about.

218
00:25:20,657 --> 00:25:23,476
I got a message from Patty Samuels.

219
00:25:23,476 --> 00:25:27,204
He's sorry he blew it on McQ,
but he rang it up with Boyle.

220
00:25:27,204 --> 00:25:30,430
Send that widow a Japanese tea set.

221
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,885
- Who are you?
- Who? I'll show you who.

222
00:25:32,885 --> 00:25:33,917
That's who.

223
00:25:33,917 --> 00:25:36,816
Patty Samuels made
a deathbed statement.

224
00:25:36,816 --> 00:25:40,449
You put up $10,000
to go bang on Boyle and me.

225
00:25:40,449 --> 00:25:41,921
- You're insane!
- Yeah?

226
00:25:41,922 --> 00:25:51,332
What's the matter? No confession?
Even under duress?

227
00:25:51,332 --> 00:25:54,215
He's taking a shower.

228
00:25:54,215 --> 00:26:06,393
The damn phones haven't stopped ringing.

229
00:26:06,393 --> 00:26:09,000
Upstairs, the city council.

230
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,772
The man has clout.

231
00:26:10,772 --> 00:26:13,902
What did you expect?
His lawyer was gonna let it die?

232
00:26:13,902 --> 00:26:14,872
I never touched him.

233
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:18,927
Sure, we talked,
but he slipped on the wet floor and fell.

234
00:26:18,927 --> 00:26:22,329
He says otherwise. So do his men.

235
00:26:22,329 --> 00:26:24,048
They're his men.

236
00:26:24,048 --> 00:26:36,296
You're off the investigation, Lieutenant,
pending review.

237
00:26:36,297 --> 00:26:38,853
What's all this?

238
00:26:38,853 --> 00:26:42,725
Everybody knows that Santiago
is the biggest dealer in the city...

239
00:26:42,725 --> 00:26:44,436
in spite of his cover.

240
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,080
Intelligence knows it, and so do the feds.

241
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,812
His "H" comes in from Canada by mule...

242
00:26:49,812 --> 00:26:51,364
Just file your report, Lieutenant.

243
00:26:51,365 --> 00:26:54,137
The commission will be pleased
to consider whatever you have to say.

244
00:26:54,137 --> 00:26:57,354
A date will be set for the review board,
and you Will be notified.

245
00:26:57,354 --> 00:27:00,476
That's it.
Until further notice, you're on a desk.

246
00:27:00,476 --> 00:27:03,471
I tried to warn you.

247
00:27:03,471 --> 00:27:11,615
No, wait.

248
00:27:11,615 --> 00:27:14,841
- Wait a minute, Lon, don't do that.
- Too much politics.

249
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,879
Come on. Don't do that.

250
00:27:16,879 --> 00:27:20,926
Go away and think about it.
You put in too many years here, Lon.

251
00:27:20,926 --> 00:27:24,288
You got a damn good record
of arrests and convictions.

252
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,425
Frank, let him go.

253
00:27:25,425 --> 00:27:28,199
He was never part of the team anyway.

254
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:32,987
Yeah, run it smooth.
Don't do anything. Don't rock the boat.

255
00:27:32,987 --> 00:27:37,504
- You mean to infer that...
- I can infer anything I want now, Chief.

256
00:27:37,504 --> 00:27:39,527
I'm a civilian again.

257
00:27:39,527 --> 00:27:44,171
What happened?

258
00:27:44,171 --> 00:27:47,772
Run this through the lab for me, will you?

259
00:27:47,772 --> 00:27:49,651
See if you can get me a make.

260
00:27:49,651 --> 00:27:53,435
- Lon?
- I'll call you.

261
00:27:53,435 --> 00:28:14,060
- Lois?
- I hope you don't mind my coming down.

262
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:19,191
I just couldn't sit home.

263
00:28:19,191 --> 00:28:20,289
Glad you did.

264
00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:25,427
Welcome aboard.

265
00:28:25,428 --> 00:28:26,725
My high-heel shoes.

266
00:28:26,725 --> 00:28:28,492
You can't hurt these decks.

267
00:28:28,492 --> 00:28:31,343
- You all right?
- Yeah.

268
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:33,956
No.

269
00:28:33,956 --> 00:28:35,994
Let me fake it.

270
00:28:35,994 --> 00:28:41,994
Thanks for holding my hand at the funeral.

271
00:28:41,994 --> 00:28:46,917
Big turnout, Wasn't it?

272
00:28:46,917 --> 00:28:51,044
Stan had a lot of friends,
that kind of a fella.

273
00:28:51,044 --> 00:28:55,880
The city went all out.

274
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,927
Fifty motorcycles, all that media coverage.

275
00:28:59,927 --> 00:29:03,081
God, why does anybody want to be a cop?

276
00:29:03,081 --> 00:29:06,179
How about a drink?

277
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:08,250
Yeah.

278
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:21,263
I'm glad now we never had any kids.

279
00:29:21,263 --> 00:29:24,417
Maybe it would have been better
having some. who knows?

280
00:29:24,417 --> 00:29:28,727
It's all right. Alcohol purifies.

281
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:36,966
How do you stand it, this living in solitary?

282
00:29:36,967 --> 00:29:39,069
You get used to it.

283
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:40,390
Water or soda?

284
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:42,293
It doesn't matter.

285
00:29:42,293 --> 00:29:45,670
You should get yourself a woman.

286
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,637
She'd at least straighten up for you.

287
00:29:47,637 --> 00:29:49,866
Not enough for them anymore.

288
00:29:49,866 --> 00:29:53,658
Women's lib, you know.

289
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:58,781
Growing up, isn't she?

290
00:29:58,782 --> 00:30:01,625
You still do your Sundays?

291
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:03,759
Wouldn't miss them for anything.

292
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:07,136
Why should you?
If you've got something good, keep it.

293
00:30:07,136 --> 00:30:12,657
I saw your ex in the papers.

294
00:30:12,658 --> 00:30:16,919
She and Forrester
at some lawyers' meeting.

295
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,883
He sure got up there all of a sudden.

296
00:30:19,883 --> 00:30:21,857
I'm glad for her.

297
00:30:21,857 --> 00:30:25,482
Lois, what are your plans?

298
00:30:25,482 --> 00:30:33,705
I don't know. I'm all mixed-up.

299
00:30:33,705 --> 00:30:36,126
Lon, can I be your sister?

300
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:38,682
Sure.

301
00:30:38,682 --> 00:30:40,569
I'd like that.

302
00:30:40,569 --> 00:30:44,807
All I had were three brothers.
we were always banging knuckles.

303
00:30:44,808 --> 00:30:48,073
Then let's do something crazy, brother.

304
00:30:48,073 --> 00:30:52,216
Let's get in your car and go someplace.

305
00:30:52,216 --> 00:30:53,441
Canada.

306
00:30:53,441 --> 00:30:57,353
Let's get lost for about 10 years. Yes.

307
00:30:57,353 --> 00:30:59,797
Ten years is just about right.

308
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:06,041
It's all right, isn't it?

309
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:09,725
Get it out.

310
00:31:09,725 --> 00:31:17,238
It's all right. It's over.

311
00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:22,385
I am tough, see?

312
00:31:22,385 --> 00:31:25,125
What about you?

313
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:27,745
I heard you quit.

314
00:31:27,745 --> 00:31:30,884
Congratulations.

315
00:31:30,884 --> 00:31:34,181
Nothing lost.

316
00:31:34,181 --> 00:31:36,945
Creeps have made all the gains.

317
00:31:36,945 --> 00:31:39,964
Cops get to listen to lots of organ music.

318
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:43,285
Go get yourself a good job.

319
00:31:43,285 --> 00:31:50,201
Yeah.

320
00:31:50,202 --> 00:32:03,518
I parked in your spot.

321
00:32:03,518 --> 00:32:06,106
It doesn't matter.
The car's in the shop anyway.

322
00:32:06,106 --> 00:32:09,237
- New bills.
- Yeah.

323
00:32:09,237 --> 00:32:12,757
Sorry about Boyle.

324
00:32:12,757 --> 00:32:14,293
Yeah.

325
00:32:14,294 --> 00:32:16,986
Want a beer?

326
00:32:16,986 --> 00:32:21,064
No, thanks.
Pinky, I want to come in with you.

327
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:23,581
Lon, there's hardly enough for me.

328
00:32:23,581 --> 00:32:27,389
Some bad checks, door shaking.
Even divorce has gone sour.

329
00:32:27,389 --> 00:32:30,192
Dissolution is putting us out of business.

330
00:32:30,192 --> 00:32:32,573
No salary.

331
00:32:32,574 --> 00:32:35,576
I need the cover of your license, Pinky.

332
00:32:35,576 --> 00:32:37,726
Looking for a base?

333
00:32:37,726 --> 00:32:40,729
That's right. I'll bring my own client.

334
00:32:40,729 --> 00:32:43,421
- Who?
- Me.

335
00:32:43,421 --> 00:32:47,468
I get it. Stan's killing.

336
00:32:47,468 --> 00:32:50,359
Do-it-yourself gumshoeing.

337
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:52,246
Why quit?
Why don't you just take a leave?

338
00:32:52,246 --> 00:32:54,061
Freer this way.

339
00:32:54,061 --> 00:32:57,391
There's a lot of badasses on the street
carrying your bruises.

340
00:32:57,391 --> 00:33:01,573
They'd love to catch you without the
protection of the departmental umbrella.

341
00:33:01,573 --> 00:33:03,803
Well, that's part of the bundle, Pinky.

342
00:33:03,803 --> 00:33:04,701
How about it?

343
00:33:04,702 --> 00:33:10,358
Well, if that's what you want,
We'll get you registered.

344
00:33:10,358 --> 00:33:14,796
Gee, Will Kosterman get hot.

345
00:33:14,796 --> 00:33:26,048
Okay, sign right there, Will you, Lon?

346
00:33:26,048 --> 00:33:53,240
His name's Freddie LaSalle.
He's a contract man from St. Louis.

347
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,701
How did he get by the airport watch?

348
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:56,935
Who knows? Drove in.

349
00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:58,574
Any surveillance on him?

350
00:33:58,574 --> 00:33:59,975
Would be if we could find him.

351
00:33:59,975 --> 00:34:02,492
How about intelligence? Why is he here?

352
00:34:02,492 --> 00:34:03,582
Nothing.

353
00:34:03,582 --> 00:34:08,234
Well, I'm located now. Pinky's.
You got his number?

354
00:34:08,234 --> 00:34:09,723
I can get it.

355
00:34:09,723 --> 00:34:13,875
I'm depending on you
to keep me up on things.

356
00:34:13,876 --> 00:34:17,697
Well, I'll do what I can, Lon,
but my neck only goes out so far.

357
00:34:17,697 --> 00:34:19,329
That's the only way to go.

358
00:34:19,329 --> 00:34:22,316
Rosey? It's me.

359
00:34:22,316 --> 00:34:24,035
Did you get any more...

360
00:34:24,036 --> 00:34:29,023
None of your snitches will help you now.
They know you can't deal anymore.

361
00:34:29,023 --> 00:34:32,074
The hell I can't.

362
00:34:32,074 --> 00:34:51,806
- Don't park it. I'm not staying.
- Yes, sir.

363
00:34:51,806 --> 00:35:25,375
- Lon, this is a surprise.
- Yeah. Nice party.

364
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:29,382
We're trying to raise some money
for a foster-parent program.

365
00:35:29,382 --> 00:35:32,002
It's awful about Stan.

366
00:35:32,002 --> 00:35:36,025
I tried to reach Lois. I'll keep trying.

367
00:35:36,025 --> 00:35:40,226
- I heard you resigned.
- That's right.

368
00:35:40,226 --> 00:35:41,696
I'm glad.

369
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:45,878
I'm sorry, too...

370
00:35:45,878 --> 00:35:48,714
that it didn't happen a long time ago.

371
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:54,402
Is Ginger around? Back from school?

372
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,217
She should be here any minute.

373
00:35:56,218 --> 00:36:01,524
Elaine, I need $5,000.

374
00:36:01,524 --> 00:36:06,785
I hope it's for a woman.

375
00:36:06,785 --> 00:36:10,606
Someone patient, brave, and caring...

376
00:36:10,606 --> 00:36:14,892
Who doesn't break out in rashes
being left alone at night.

377
00:36:14,892 --> 00:36:18,245
I'll have to ask Walter.

378
00:36:18,245 --> 00:36:21,447
Hello, Lon.

379
00:36:21,448 --> 00:36:27,981
- You're looking fit.
- You, too.

380
00:36:27,981 --> 00:36:29,501
How about Elaine?

381
00:36:29,501 --> 00:36:31,946
- Looks marvelous, doesn't she?
- Always did.

382
00:36:31,946 --> 00:36:36,615
- Walter, Lon wants $5,000.
- A loan.

383
00:36:36,615 --> 00:36:39,665
I have $6,000 or $7,000
coming from my pension...

384
00:36:39,665 --> 00:36:43,107
but I won’t get it for three months,
and I need the money right now.

385
00:36:43,107 --> 00:36:49,003
- All right.
- I've drawn up this paper.

386
00:36:49,003 --> 00:36:50,356
The fund will pay you directly.

387
00:36:50,356 --> 00:36:51,812
That's not necessary, Lon.
Just pay me back when you can.

388
00:36:51,812 --> 00:36:52,918
I'd rather do it this way.

389
00:36:52,918 --> 00:37:01,596
All right. I'll get a check.

390
00:37:01,596 --> 00:37:08,719
Goodbye.

391
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:13,754
Daddy! Hi!

392
00:37:13,754 --> 00:37:16,622
Hello, Ginger.

393
00:37:16,622 --> 00:37:20,094
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetheart.

394
00:37:20,095 --> 00:37:23,360
Look at this, 99 out of a 100. I'm a genius.

395
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,352
I've got a couple of tickets
to the Sunday basketball game.

396
00:37:27,352 --> 00:37:28,410
How about it?

397
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:31,229
Dad, Jane invited me to her house
at the marina.

398
00:37:31,229 --> 00:37:33,491
She's having a boy-girl party, my first one.

399
00:37:33,491 --> 00:37:35,641
Then you'll have to go to Janie's.

400
00:37:35,641 --> 00:37:38,221
- Maybe next week.
- Lf there's not another party.

401
00:37:38,221 --> 00:37:39,705
I'm getting very popular.
I think it's my charm.

402
00:37:39,705 --> 00:37:47,008
I called the bank...

403
00:37:47,008 --> 00:37:51,422
and told them you'd be down to cash it.
There will be no difficulty.

404
00:37:51,422 --> 00:37:52,735
Thanks, Walter.

405
00:37:52,735 --> 00:37:57,348
I'll see you.

406
00:37:57,348 --> 00:38:23,751
What's the score?

407
00:38:23,751 --> 00:38:25,869
The Lakers are doing it
to them righteously.

408
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:29,015
There's my man.
I'm gonna transact some business.

409
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:30,305
Why don't you get something to eat?

410
00:38:30,306 --> 00:38:33,355
Get Daddy something, too, here,
and you be really sweet to yourself.

411
00:38:33,355 --> 00:38:36,135
What you got for me, my man?

412
00:38:36,135 --> 00:38:39,098
That's all right. Walsh is playing?

413
00:38:39,098 --> 00:38:42,914
I'll tell you what, I'm going to run three
on this one, and two...

414
00:38:42,914 --> 00:38:43,709
Watch it.

415
00:38:43,709 --> 00:38:53,886
Baby, give me the hot dogs.

416
00:38:53,886 --> 00:38:56,266
Stay right here.

417
00:38:56,266 --> 00:38:57,898
Daddy's got some more business
to take care of.

418
00:38:57,898 --> 00:39:03,794
- Hello, Rosey.
- I don't have to talk to you.

419
00:39:03,794 --> 00:39:05,609
You're not the heat anymore,
you know What I mean?

420
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:09,209
- Like, you're useless.
- Hold it, Rosey.

421
00:39:09,209 --> 00:39:12,994
What are you going to do?
Go fist city on me?

422
00:39:12,994 --> 00:39:16,522
I can dig that,
you know, a week in the hospital.

423
00:39:16,522 --> 00:39:17,923
Rest and relaxation for me,
you know What I mean?

424
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:20,854
There's five bills in this newspaper.

425
00:39:20,854 --> 00:39:24,391
I don't even sneeze for less than 10.

426
00:39:24,391 --> 00:39:30,223
All right. Let's turn to the second section.

427
00:39:30,223 --> 00:39:33,824
There's five more if it's beautiful.

428
00:39:33,824 --> 00:39:43,745
Santiago has got company
from out of state.

429
00:39:43,745 --> 00:39:45,791
Freddie LaSalle?

430
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:47,917
That's worth zip.

431
00:39:47,917 --> 00:39:50,186
- Enjoy the game.
- There's more.

432
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:52,759
More hardware.

433
00:39:52,759 --> 00:39:58,328
A cat by the name
of German Kaufman from Denver.

434
00:39:58,328 --> 00:39:59,865
Two hit men.

435
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:04,541
Three.
A Lou Something-Or-Other from Miami.

436
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:07,599
Santiago is collecting a murder squad.

437
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,610
- Something else.
- What?

438
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:14,036
You'd be surprised how the cost of living...

439
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:17,158
- has gone up in the black community.
- It stops right here.

440
00:40:17,158 --> 00:40:22,592
A heist team.

441
00:40:22,592 --> 00:40:26,551
A heist team?
Rosey, you're shining me on.

442
00:40:26,551 --> 00:40:29,769
No, this is the straight skinny.
It must be something special.

443
00:40:29,769 --> 00:40:31,297
Drugs?

444
00:40:31,297 --> 00:40:33,838
You know Santiago. Now, what’s his bag?

445
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:36,171
Did Stan find something out?

446
00:40:36,171 --> 00:40:38,233
He's got his own connections.
You ask them.

447
00:40:38,233 --> 00:40:41,419
I'm missing all the action, babe.

448
00:40:41,419 --> 00:40:45,602
Rosey, if this is a shine...

449
00:40:45,602 --> 00:40:48,326
I'm coming back and ironing your face.

450
00:40:48,326 --> 00:40:51,034
Personally, I think it's worth more.

451
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:54,196
I'll get you some Blue Chip Stamps.

452
00:40:54,196 --> 00:41:07,640
Cocaine, Sal? Let's have them, Sal.

453
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,687
The balloons. Spit them out.

454
00:41:11,687 --> 00:41:15,072
- Spit them out!
- What the hell is this?

455
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:16,728
You ain't even a cop anymore!

456
00:41:16,728 --> 00:41:19,204
- Go see some basketball.
- Basketball?

457
00:41:19,204 --> 00:41:37,335
You've got a nerve,
picking your way in here.

458
00:41:37,335 --> 00:41:41,493
What is this?

459
00:41:41,493 --> 00:41:44,950
I've got a good mind to call a cop.

460
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:55,485
- So What?
- I thought you might be interested.

461
00:41:55,485 --> 00:41:58,249
Why should I be? I'm no doper.

462
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:00,215
Where did you get that idea?

463
00:42:00,215 --> 00:42:08,512
Look, I'm tired.
I've been hustling drinks for 10 hours.

464
00:42:08,512 --> 00:42:12,733
My feet hurt, my back hurts,
and I need a bath.

465
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:13,878
So go on.

466
00:42:13,878 --> 00:42:22,349
Let's cut through it, Myra.

467
00:42:22,349 --> 00:42:25,264
You were a good friend
of Stan's in the past.

468
00:42:25,264 --> 00:42:29,805
He was a nice guy. He was a gentleman.

469
00:42:29,805 --> 00:42:36,673
It was a damn shame.

470
00:42:36,673 --> 00:42:39,979
Not that there was ever
anything between us.

471
00:42:39,979 --> 00:42:43,372
Personal, I mean.
We were just good friends.

472
00:42:43,372 --> 00:42:46,942
Sure, I know that. He respected you.

473
00:42:46,942 --> 00:42:49,880
- You bet he did.
- He brought the balloons...

474
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,170
and you spoke of things in general.

475
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:58,747
If I hear anything...

476
00:42:58,747 --> 00:43:02,180
it's my civic duty to tell the right person.

477
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:06,729
Who else knows?

478
00:43:06,729 --> 00:43:11,326
- Why don't you guys print up a program?
- Nobody knows, Myra.

479
00:43:11,326 --> 00:43:13,779
I was just Stan's very good friend.

480
00:43:13,779 --> 00:43:17,842
I talked only to Stan...

481
00:43:17,842 --> 00:43:20,821
not his very good friend...

482
00:43:20,821 --> 00:43:24,541
and I'm not talking to you.

483
00:43:24,541 --> 00:43:28,388
I don't like you. I never did.

484
00:43:28,388 --> 00:43:31,391
You're a bear.

485
00:43:31,392 --> 00:43:35,542
I don't like bears. Out.

486
00:43:35,542 --> 00:43:37,843
Okay.

487
00:43:37,843 --> 00:43:51,152
Wait.

488
00:43:51,152 --> 00:43:52,984
Skag or coke?

489
00:43:52,984 --> 00:43:53,673
I don't go skag.

490
00:43:53,674 --> 00:43:58,318
I know what you go, Myra.

491
00:43:58,318 --> 00:43:59,146
Can I see one?

492
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,764
You have a bill handy?

493
00:44:09,765 --> 00:44:10,328
"C" note. Class.

494
00:44:10,328 --> 00:44:11,948
Roll it for me, Will you, like a good fella?

495
00:44:18,949 --> 00:44:21,812
Do you mind? It hurts my eyes.

496
00:44:21,812 --> 00:44:27,654
You see, the lounge is dark all of the time,
so my pupils get dilated.

497
00:44:27,654 --> 00:44:33,199
Dilated pupils
is a natural condition with me.

498
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:34,966
That's why some people think I'm a coker.

499
00:44:34,966 --> 00:44:39,124
Myra, did Stan have some information?
Was that why he was killed?

500
00:44:39,125 --> 00:44:43,227
Why don't you take off your coat?
Aren't you hot?

501
00:44:43,227 --> 00:44:50,072
- Personally, I think it's hot.
- Know anything about a drug heist?

502
00:44:50,072 --> 00:44:56,031
- Think I'm fat?
- No, I think you look real nice.

503
00:44:56,031 --> 00:44:56,787
Yeah?

504
00:44:56,787 --> 00:45:02,571
I'm fat. Baby fat.

505
00:45:02,571 --> 00:45:08,180
It needs lifting. Even that Won't help.

506
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:10,529
What I need is a complete overhaul.

507
00:45:10,529 --> 00:45:13,405
Myra, I'm asking you something.

508
00:45:13,405 --> 00:45:17,141
Sure, honey...

509
00:45:17,141 --> 00:45:18,876
I'll tell you.

510
00:45:18,876 --> 00:45:22,158
Be glad to...

511
00:45:22,158 --> 00:45:24,149
in the morning.

512
00:45:24,149 --> 00:45:32,643
You said I looked real nice. You said it.

513
00:45:32,643 --> 00:45:35,119
Myra, in your job...

514
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:39,150
you must meet a lot
of younger men around.

515
00:45:39,151 --> 00:45:40,408
Sure.

516
00:45:40,408 --> 00:45:43,849
Phone rings day and night,
don't you know...

517
00:45:43,849 --> 00:45:46,461
but I'm ignoring it.

518
00:45:46,461 --> 00:45:49,886
I'm picking you, honey.

519
00:45:49,887 --> 00:46:08,638
- How about some coffee?
- Hi.

520
00:46:08,638 --> 00:46:13,187
I'll fix some bacon and eggs. Okay?
You cool it...

521
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:16,063
Thanks, Myra, but I got a big day.

522
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:18,842
Sure.

523
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:21,064
I'm busy myself.

524
00:46:21,064 --> 00:46:35,329
I don't know what Stan knew.

525
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:36,491
I didn't tell him.

526
00:46:36,491 --> 00:46:40,027
I didn't know myself until yesterday.

527
00:46:40,027 --> 00:46:44,002
- Some hard rocks from out of town.
- What's the setup?

528
00:46:44,003 --> 00:46:47,643
Drug heist, like you thought.

529
00:46:47,643 --> 00:46:50,510
They're going
for the biggest stash in the city.

530
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:54,286
- Where?
- You're the detective.

531
00:46:54,286 --> 00:46:55,607
Detect.

532
00:46:55,607 --> 00:46:58,251
Give me some help.

533
00:46:58,251 --> 00:47:02,322
Look Where the men in blue hang out.

534
00:47:02,322 --> 00:47:06,999
- I can't believe it.
- So go find out.

535
00:47:06,999 --> 00:47:10,783
Only thing is, you better hurry.

536
00:47:10,783 --> 00:47:27,000
- Hello, Joe.
- Hi, Lon, how are you doing?

537
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,518
All right.

538
00:47:28,518 --> 00:47:44,316
- 2549, cocaine.
- Check.

539
00:47:44,316 --> 00:47:46,976
- 2268, heroin.
- Check.

540
00:47:46,976 --> 00:47:48,074
Hi, Steve.

541
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:50,933
Hi, Lon. what brings you around?

542
00:47:50,933 --> 00:47:53,402
Just picking some stuff
up out of my locker.

543
00:47:53,402 --> 00:47:55,217
- How’s it going?
- Not bad.

544
00:47:55,217 --> 00:47:57,773
The wife’s having a little problem, though.
You know women.

545
00:47:57,773 --> 00:48:01,015
- She's going to the hospital tomorrow.
- That's too bad.

546
00:48:01,015 --> 00:48:06,123
- That concludes it. Sign here, please.
- Okay.

547
00:48:06,123 --> 00:48:24,070
Would you believe
you're looking at over $2 million?

548
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:26,849
I sure would.

549
00:48:26,849 --> 00:48:29,525
Where are they burning it
this time, Sarge?

550
00:48:29,525 --> 00:48:32,894
- Beats me. State secret.
- See you.

551
00:48:32,894 --> 00:49:43,612
Sorry.

552
00:49:43,612 --> 00:51:42,391
What are you doing down there?

553
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:44,916
I'm looking for a restroom.

554
00:51:44,916 --> 00:51:48,189
It's not down here.
It's upstairs and to the left.

555
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:49,447
Thanks.

556
00:51:49,447 --> 00:52:01,018
- Howdy, Sarge.
- Good morning.

557
00:52:01,018 --> 00:52:10,142
Drop the boxes! Drop them!

558
00:52:10,142 --> 00:52:49,771
Dr. Chaplin to the emergency room,
first floor.

559
00:52:49,771 --> 00:53:47,733
Take off!

560
00:53:47,734 --> 00:54:28,268
Are you crazy?

561
00:54:28,268 --> 00:58:07,130
Get out of that truck!

562
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:08,459
Open those rear doors.

563
00:58:08,459 --> 00:58:22,110
- Who are you working for?
- I work for the laundry company.

564
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:25,368
Why did you blast through
those stop signs?

565
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:29,598
The way you was chasing me,
I thought you were some sort of nut.

566
00:58:29,598 --> 00:58:35,550
Maybe I am. Take off.

567
00:58:35,550 --> 00:59:00,072
Professional all the way.
We found the linen truck.

568
00:59:00,072 --> 00:59:03,178
- The switch had already been made.
- How much did they get?

569
00:59:03,179 --> 00:59:05,743
Property is totaling it up now.

570
00:59:05,743 --> 00:59:08,793
Megabucks.
Must be $2 million wholesale, anyway.

571
00:59:08,794 --> 00:59:11,143
Robbing the police. Man, that's beautiful.

572
00:59:11,143 --> 00:59:13,340
Chief wants to see you at half past.

573
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:15,482
- Capt. Windott's on his way.
- I'll bet he is.

574
00:59:15,483 --> 00:59:18,613
Sgt. Kennedy. Yeah. Let me have it.

575
00:59:18,613 --> 00:59:28,032
Now, What the hell was that?
Just what the hell was that?

576
00:59:28,032 --> 00:59:30,963
- You hot-dogging it around like that!
- I wasn’t sure on my information...

577
00:59:30,963 --> 00:59:34,683
You didn't have to be sure.
Your responsibility is to let us know.

578
00:59:34,683 --> 00:59:36,673
My responsibility is to my client.

579
00:59:36,674 --> 00:59:39,286
Nothing in the law
says I have to tell you anything.

580
00:59:39,286 --> 00:59:43,548
Okay.

581
00:59:43,548 --> 00:59:46,710
Then you better tell your client...

582
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:49,346
to find himself a new private.

583
00:59:49,346 --> 00:59:52,677
Pending a look into that shootout,
there will be a delay...

584
00:59:52,678 --> 00:59:55,113
in approval of Pinky's request
to take you on.

585
00:59:55,113 --> 00:59:57,733
We're all set, Captain.
I'll search Santiago's place.

586
00:59:57,733 --> 01:00:01,246
I'll cover his house, but even if he's got it,
he's not gonna have his stash there.

587
01:00:01,246 --> 01:00:04,894
Ed, you've gotta help me
with something here.

588
01:00:04,894 --> 01:00:07,833
Let's say for a minute McQ is right...

589
01:00:07,833 --> 01:00:10,868
and Santiago needed the dope
to supply his people...

590
01:00:10,868 --> 01:00:12,898
so he brought in this robbery team, right?

591
01:00:12,898 --> 01:00:17,017
Now you tell me, how did he know
When state was gonna move it...

592
01:00:17,017 --> 01:00:20,378
or how did he know
Where it was gonna be burned?

593
01:00:20,378 --> 01:00:21,771
Now,
I understand that's private information.

594
01:00:21,771 --> 01:00:25,340
That's right. State sets the time and place.

595
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:28,304
- So somebody leaked it, right?
- Yes, somebody.

596
01:00:28,304 --> 01:00:31,306
Ed, what about a connection...

597
01:00:31,306 --> 01:00:34,269
between the robbery
and the murders of Boyle and the officers?

598
01:00:34,269 --> 01:00:37,933
There's a connection, all right.
One of the officers shot was in Property...

599
01:00:37,933 --> 01:00:39,262
Wally Johnson.

600
01:00:39,262 --> 01:00:43,365
Frank, if there's a tie-in, we’ll find it.

601
01:00:43,365 --> 01:00:45,985
You're forgetting something. You're out.

602
01:00:45,985 --> 01:00:49,203
And I wanna tell you something. I'm glad.

603
01:00:49,203 --> 01:00:53,640
Just a minute, you still carrying?

604
01:00:53,640 --> 01:01:02,445
Better leave it.

605
01:01:02,445 --> 01:01:04,938
For the time being, your permit is revoked.

606
01:01:04,938 --> 01:01:09,360
And if you give me any more
of your crap...

607
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:13,877
you will find employment of any kind
is just a little out of your reach.

608
01:01:13,877 --> 01:01:17,206
If you want me to hit you harder,
I can do that, too.

609
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:21,030
Sir, Capt. Windott's here.

610
01:01:21,030 --> 01:01:24,328
Hi, Phil. Get out.

611
01:01:24,328 --> 01:01:27,864
- Ed, don't you think McQ here...
- Frank!

612
01:01:27,865 --> 01:01:32,772
- Phil. How are you?
- Fine.

613
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:33,799
We've got a problem.

614
01:01:33,799 --> 01:01:37,518
Franklin Toms, field deputy, city council.

615
01:01:37,519 --> 01:01:39,684
- Capt. Windott.
- Frank.

616
01:01:39,684 --> 01:01:41,021
Nice to meet you.

617
01:01:41,022 --> 01:01:44,694
Let me know how the sweep comes out.

618
01:01:44,694 --> 01:01:48,478
- I'll be going by Lois' house tonight.
- Okay, Lon.

619
01:01:48,478 --> 01:02:06,226
- Hey, Lon.
- Jack.

620
01:02:06,226 --> 01:02:10,288
- What are you doing?
- Buying a gun. This one.

621
01:02:10,288 --> 01:02:14,104
Got a minute? I got something
I wanna show you in back.

622
01:02:14,104 --> 01:02:25,484
Lon, I have a little equalizer here.

623
01:02:25,484 --> 01:02:27,697
We're gonna try to sell it
to the department.

624
01:02:27,698 --> 01:02:29,840
- The Ingram.
- Ingram?

625
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:33,440
- Nine millimeter.
- Six, seven pounds?

626
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:37,606
6.25. The silencer makes a nice handle.

627
01:02:37,606 --> 01:02:42,163
Lon, this can here is filled with water.
Go on. Squeeze off a burst.

628
01:02:42,163 --> 01:02:43,931
Why not?

629
01:02:43,931 --> 01:03:03,081
How about that?

630
01:03:03,082 --> 01:03:07,415
Those 32 slugs came out
in a second and a half.

631
01:03:07,415 --> 01:03:09,366
Yeah.

632
01:03:09,366 --> 01:03:15,796
Did you ever see anything like it?

633
01:03:15,796 --> 01:03:19,484
You're not going to take it, are you?

634
01:03:19,484 --> 01:03:21,475
Just say it's a loan.

635
01:03:21,475 --> 01:03:25,314
Lon, it's not licensed!

636
01:03:25,314 --> 01:03:27,921
Jack, neither am I.

637
01:03:27,921 --> 01:03:35,154
I am going down to see my folks.

638
01:03:35,154 --> 01:03:39,272
Why don't we get into that Green Hornet
of yours and go down together?

639
01:03:39,272 --> 01:03:42,602
- I'd like to, but...
- I see.

640
01:03:42,602 --> 01:03:46,586
Lon, why don't you catch on?
Police work can't be done these days.

641
01:03:46,586 --> 01:03:54,816
Crime isn't just organized,
it's institutionalized.

642
01:03:54,816 --> 01:03:58,632
Thanks.

643
01:03:58,632 --> 01:04:00,790
- And you're blowing it, you know.
- What?

644
01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:04,072
Your allotment, brother. You're off
the force. You won’t get licensed.

645
01:04:04,072 --> 01:04:08,206
You know, kid, you're empty.
Why don't you do something filling?

646
01:04:08,207 --> 01:04:11,034
I wanna know who did it and why.

647
01:04:11,034 --> 01:04:15,639
You'd think I would, too, wouldn’t you?

648
01:04:15,639 --> 01:04:24,109
Hello. Yes, he's still here.

649
01:04:24,109 --> 01:04:29,718
- Hello.
- Lon, J.C. The search is over.

650
01:04:29,718 --> 01:04:32,864
- What happened?
- What we figured. Zip.

651
01:04:32,864 --> 01:04:35,779
Okay, J.C. Thanks.

652
01:04:35,779 --> 01:04:37,087
Go on home.

653
01:04:37,087 --> 01:04:45,435
- Nothing.
- Santiago doesn't have it.

654
01:04:45,436 --> 01:04:48,932
He has it, all right.
He's probably driving it around town.

655
01:04:48,933 --> 01:04:51,297
That's the standard procedure.

656
01:04:51,298 --> 01:04:56,133
Now, what do you think
Would be a safe place to stash it?

657
01:04:56,134 --> 01:05:00,284
- Where the police have already been.
- I think you're right.

658
01:05:00,284 --> 01:05:02,514
Do you have to leave?

659
01:05:02,514 --> 01:05:07,725
- No big hurry.
- Refill?

660
01:05:07,725 --> 01:05:09,268
Why not?

661
01:05:09,268 --> 01:05:13,594
Lon, can I tell you something?

662
01:05:13,594 --> 01:05:17,912
Stan and I were having trouble
for a long time.

663
01:05:17,912 --> 01:05:23,218
We were in the same bed,
but it was just sleeping.

664
01:05:23,218 --> 01:05:26,102
Did he say anything?

665
01:05:26,102 --> 01:05:32,468
- Did he tell you I was leaving him?
- No.

666
01:05:32,468 --> 01:05:36,060
I thought you two
knew everything about each other.

667
01:05:36,061 --> 01:05:39,908
Everything and nothing.

668
01:05:39,908 --> 01:05:43,875
I really don't want you as a brother.

669
01:05:43,875 --> 01:05:46,209
I guess I never did.

670
01:05:46,209 --> 01:05:51,555
That's the danger of the buddy system.

671
01:05:51,555 --> 01:05:54,589
Maybe the manual needs rewriting.

672
01:05:54,589 --> 01:05:58,915
- Maybe it does.
- Why not?

673
01:05:58,915 --> 01:06:06,318
A couple of empties.

674
01:06:06,318 --> 01:06:10,030
Like in the songs...

675
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:12,004
let's help each other through the night.

676
01:06:12,004 --> 01:06:24,811
- Hi.
- Frank, come in.

677
01:06:24,811 --> 01:06:28,100
- Frank?
- Hey, Lon. I didn't know you were here.

678
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:31,908
I'm glad you are. I need to talk
With both of you, as a matter of fact.

679
01:06:31,908 --> 01:06:34,249
Sit down. Would you like a drink?

680
01:06:34,249 --> 01:06:37,762
No. Yeah, I will. Give me a Scotch
and water, if you don't mind.

681
01:06:37,762 --> 01:06:41,889
The commission asked me
to stop by, Lois...

682
01:06:41,889 --> 01:06:43,497
to see if you needed anything,
if you wanted anything.

683
01:06:43,497 --> 01:06:45,623
- I'm fine, thanks.
- Okay.

684
01:06:45,623 --> 01:06:50,148
And about that job, I know
I can get you clerical work in accounting...

685
01:06:50,148 --> 01:06:52,728
but if you can hold on
just a little bit longer...

686
01:06:52,728 --> 01:06:57,780
I heard a better job
Was gonna open in Public Affairs.

687
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:59,643
- Sounds good to me.
- Good.

688
01:06:59,643 --> 01:07:05,220
I'm sorry about the hassle
they've been giving you downtown, Lon.

689
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:07,641
And I agree with you,
Ed's on the wrong track.

690
01:07:07,641 --> 01:07:11,146
I mean, he's got this bug
about the militant angle, see.

691
01:07:11,146 --> 01:07:13,367
There's gotta be more to it than that.

692
01:07:13,367 --> 01:07:16,362
I'm gonna talk with him.
I'm gonna change his mind.

693
01:07:16,362 --> 01:07:17,380
That would be a start.

694
01:07:17,381 --> 01:07:21,603
But if I were you,
I'd cool it for a little while, anyway...

695
01:07:21,603 --> 01:07:23,848
because it just seems to me
you're damned exposed.

696
01:07:23,848 --> 01:07:26,445
Yeah.

697
01:07:26,445 --> 01:07:31,743
Have you eaten? And you?
Let's all have dinner someplace.

698
01:07:31,743 --> 01:07:34,961
I'd like that...

699
01:07:34,961 --> 01:07:38,521
but I guess
it'll have to wait till another time.

700
01:07:38,522 --> 01:07:41,708
Good night, Lois. See you tomorrow.

701
01:07:41,708 --> 01:11:14,348
Just ease the gun out.

702
01:11:14,348 --> 01:11:41,226
Make yourself comfortable.

703
01:11:41,226 --> 01:11:49,162
I guess I Was expected.

704
01:11:49,162 --> 01:11:52,444
Breaking and entering. Very serious.

705
01:11:52,444 --> 01:11:56,475
Robbery and possession of narcotics.

706
01:11:56,475 --> 01:11:58,537
You're in more trouble than I.

707
01:11:58,537 --> 01:12:00,089
We shall see.

708
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:03,188
Look.

709
01:12:03,188 --> 01:12:10,375
I don't like what you did to me.

710
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:13,003
I suppose I can understand it...

711
01:12:13,004 --> 01:12:16,245
the rage of a man who’s lost a good friend.

712
01:12:16,245 --> 01:12:20,188
But I don't like what you did to me.

713
01:12:20,189 --> 01:12:23,319
I kind of enjoyed it myself.

714
01:12:23,319 --> 01:12:28,442
You interrupted my coffee. Have some.

715
01:12:28,442 --> 01:12:29,954
No, thanks.

716
01:12:29,954 --> 01:12:32,551
Come on, now. Relax.

717
01:12:32,551 --> 01:12:35,274
One spoonful or two?

718
01:12:35,274 --> 01:12:38,046
Two.

719
01:12:38,046 --> 01:12:42,563
It has been my observation
that policemen like their coffee sweet.

720
01:12:42,563 --> 01:12:48,555
Sugar!

721
01:12:48,555 --> 01:12:52,091
All of it. Sugar!

722
01:12:52,092 --> 01:12:54,871
Where's the stolen sugar?

723
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:58,225
Do you understand what’s happened?

724
01:12:58,225 --> 01:13:00,893
A switch has taken place...

725
01:13:00,893 --> 01:13:03,911
and where?

726
01:13:03,911 --> 01:13:08,038
Where else but the police
department itself?

727
01:13:08,038 --> 01:13:13,041
Actually, I find it quite charming.

728
01:13:13,041 --> 01:13:16,283
I arrange a robbery...

729
01:13:16,283 --> 01:13:19,135
a very difficult robbery.

730
01:13:19,135 --> 01:13:23,142
Stealing from the police itself.

731
01:13:23,142 --> 01:13:27,228
But before I can steal from them...

732
01:13:27,229 --> 01:13:29,538
they steal from me.

733
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:32,564
My heart bleeds for you.

734
01:13:32,564 --> 01:13:34,771
If you're bleeding, it's for yourself.

735
01:13:34,771 --> 01:13:37,709
Your people are the violators.

736
01:13:37,709 --> 01:13:41,326
Proof again of how unfair things are.

737
01:13:41,326 --> 01:13:45,436
The advantage always lies
With the people on the inside.

738
01:13:45,436 --> 01:13:47,618
Who?

739
01:13:47,618 --> 01:13:50,302
You ask me?

740
01:13:50,302 --> 01:13:54,166
How do I know?

741
01:13:54,166 --> 01:13:57,169
I'm on the outside.

742
01:13:57,169 --> 01:14:00,588
But big people, it would seem.

743
01:14:00,588 --> 01:14:03,126
A big operation...

744
01:14:03,126 --> 01:14:05,818
Who else but big people?

745
01:14:05,818 --> 01:14:08,861
How about Stan Boyle? Did you blast him?

746
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:12,143
I had no reason.

747
01:14:12,143 --> 01:14:18,477
Possibly he discovered...

748
01:14:18,477 --> 01:14:21,472
What was taking place.

749
01:14:21,472 --> 01:14:24,841
Perhaps it's been going on for a long time.

750
01:14:24,842 --> 01:14:29,709
Maybe everything that was ever burned
Was sugar.

751
01:14:29,709 --> 01:14:34,458
Now, I find that concept fascinating.

752
01:14:34,458 --> 01:14:38,473
Certain officials...

753
01:14:38,473 --> 01:14:41,172
are my competitors.

754
01:14:41,172 --> 01:14:44,231
See what the world has become?

755
01:14:44,231 --> 01:14:46,198
Well, I can't help you.

756
01:14:46,198 --> 01:14:48,188
Then go.

757
01:14:48,188 --> 01:14:50,904
I have nothing to fear from you.

758
01:14:50,904 --> 01:14:53,556
All this Will be destroyed...

759
01:14:53,556 --> 01:14:56,567
and no one will know
of my embarrassment...

760
01:14:56,567 --> 01:15:01,331
except those very clever officials.

761
01:15:01,331 --> 01:15:04,860
Of course.

762
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:08,500
One more thing.

763
01:15:08,501 --> 01:15:18,079
I don't see anything.
What'd he hit you with?

764
01:15:18,079 --> 01:15:22,341
Powdered sugar. The hell with that, Pinky.
Let's get on with it.

765
01:15:22,341 --> 01:15:27,408
Let's see what we can put together.

766
01:15:27,408 --> 01:15:30,857
- There are two separate frolics here.
- That's right.

767
01:15:30,857 --> 01:15:34,402
Santiago arranged the heist,
and he came up a loser.

768
01:15:34,402 --> 01:15:36,607
Insiders pulled this job.

769
01:15:36,608 --> 01:15:39,730
Wally Johnson stood
the morning watch alone.

770
01:15:39,730 --> 01:15:42,406
It'd be easy for him
to slip out the dope and slip in the sugar.

771
01:15:42,406 --> 01:15:45,313
His murder, Hyatt's, and Stan's
all connect.

772
01:15:45,313 --> 01:15:47,519
And no militants mixed up in it, right?

773
01:15:47,519 --> 01:15:48,609
Yeah.

774
01:15:48,609 --> 01:15:51,707
And that makes you wonder, doesn't it...

775
01:15:51,708 --> 01:15:54,128
Why Kosterman was
so eager to stick them.

776
01:15:54,128 --> 01:15:55,457
Yeah, doesn't it?

777
01:15:55,457 --> 01:15:57,512
That's why I need you.

778
01:15:57,512 --> 01:16:00,490
So you check IRS, his bank accounts...

779
01:16:00,491 --> 01:16:03,972
any girlfriend he might have on the side.
You know the routine.

780
01:16:03,972 --> 01:16:06,369
Kosterman. That's heavy.

781
01:16:06,369 --> 01:16:13,771
- What are you gonna do?
- I've got my own angle.

782
01:16:13,771 --> 01:16:17,483
He probably collected and stashed
that dope by now.

783
01:16:17,483 --> 01:16:19,187
If it's not on the street already.

784
01:16:19,187 --> 01:16:25,116
- Sgt. Davis.
- J.C.?

785
01:16:25,116 --> 01:16:27,209
This is Lon.

786
01:16:27,209 --> 01:16:29,072
- Can you talk?
- Go.

787
01:16:29,072 --> 01:16:31,549
Has a new supply of junk hit the streets?

788
01:16:31,549 --> 01:16:33,021
Not a thing, Lon.

789
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:34,454
Let me know if it does.

790
01:16:34,454 --> 01:16:37,480
Sure. What is it? What are you into?

791
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:40,778
Don't ask. Just answer. It's best that Way.

792
01:16:40,778 --> 01:16:48,380
McQ.

793
01:16:48,380 --> 01:17:11,532
Coffee.

794
01:17:11,532 --> 01:17:20,129
Go outside and bring the car
around front, baby.

795
01:17:20,129 --> 01:17:22,710
We're not gonna be here much longer.
The air in here got foul.

796
01:17:22,710 --> 01:17:25,178
Just go get the car, baby, and be cool.

797
01:17:25,179 --> 01:17:30,405
What the hell is wrong with you, McQ,
coming here?

798
01:17:30,405 --> 01:17:34,077
Don't get excited, Rosey.
I hear you're holding out on me.

799
01:17:34,077 --> 01:17:36,674
What are you trying to do, man,
run me out of business?

800
01:17:36,674 --> 01:17:40,282
Your stuff's coming down
from headquarters, some top brass.

801
01:17:40,282 --> 01:17:43,508
What the hell are you talking about, McQ?

802
01:17:43,508 --> 01:17:45,475
I get from Santiago. You know that.

803
01:17:45,475 --> 01:17:48,748
I don't know anything about any cops,
either.

804
01:17:48,749 --> 01:17:50,309
I think you do, and I wanna hear it.

805
01:17:50,309 --> 01:17:56,914
- Okay, but not here.
- Here. Now.

806
01:17:56,914 --> 01:18:02,954
You know what will happen to me
if I'm seen with you on my tail?

807
01:18:02,954 --> 01:18:05,199
Man, I'll be out of business in a week.

808
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:08,688
Look, McQ, on the force or off,
you are bad news...

809
01:18:08,688 --> 01:18:10,830
and if anybody Was dirty,
you ought to know who.

810
01:18:10,830 --> 01:18:12,940
What do you mean by that?

811
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:15,489
Boyle, your buddy. That's who.

812
01:18:15,489 --> 01:18:18,324
Now, there's a cat
that smelled bad all the way.

813
01:18:18,324 --> 01:18:21,025
Back that up, Rosey.

814
01:18:21,025 --> 01:18:23,533
Give me something solid to support it.

815
01:18:23,533 --> 01:18:24,686
Street talk.

816
01:18:24,686 --> 01:18:27,920
The same way I get everything else
for you, street talk.

817
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:33,370
You ever bad-talk Boyle again...

818
01:18:33,370 --> 01:18:35,918
I'll kill you.

819
01:18:35,918 --> 01:19:04,075
Myra?

820
01:19:04,075 --> 01:19:07,780
Hi.

821
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:11,914
I don't know if it's healthy
being seen with you.

822
01:19:11,914 --> 01:19:13,984
I hear you're making a lot of people mad.

823
01:19:13,984 --> 01:19:15,744
Sit down a minute.

824
01:19:15,744 --> 01:19:24,868
You heard about the drug heist...

825
01:19:24,868 --> 01:19:27,871
the hit on the state narco officers.

826
01:19:27,871 --> 01:19:29,630
Yes, it's been all over the TV.

827
01:19:29,630 --> 01:19:31,126
And there's a rumor...

828
01:19:31,126 --> 01:19:35,460
that somebody down at headquarters
isn't clean.

829
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:39,101
I don't know anything about that.

830
01:19:39,101 --> 01:19:43,299
You Wouldn't be holding out on me, Myra?

831
01:19:43,299 --> 01:19:47,657
- I'm a tired man.
- No.

832
01:19:47,657 --> 01:19:49,536
I'm not dealing, Lon...

833
01:19:49,536 --> 01:19:54,300
- but When you are rested...
- You know something?

834
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:56,346
You are attractive.

835
01:19:56,346 --> 01:19:59,278
Sure.

836
01:19:59,278 --> 01:20:03,587
That's all that a girl like me needs,
is a liar like you.

837
01:20:03,587 --> 01:20:08,662
You sure you won’t come in?

838
01:20:08,662 --> 01:20:10,916
Thanks.

839
01:20:10,916 --> 01:20:18,111
If you should change your mind,
you know where I'll be.

840
01:20:18,111 --> 01:20:22,389
No. That's all right. Thank you.

841
01:20:22,389 --> 01:20:32,159
Good night.

842
01:20:32,159 --> 01:21:07,154
Just a minute, Lon, honey. I'm coming.

843
01:21:07,154 --> 01:21:16,063
No.

844
01:21:16,063 --> 01:21:30,535
Hello.

845
01:21:30,535 --> 01:21:35,458
Lon, where the hell have you been?
I've been trying to reach you.

846
01:21:35,458 --> 01:21:38,844
- What did Myra tell you?
- Nothing.

847
01:21:38,844 --> 01:21:40,292
She didn't know a thing.

848
01:21:40,293 --> 01:21:43,773
Somebody thought she did.
She's been killed.

849
01:21:43,773 --> 01:21:49,335
Damn.

850
01:21:49,335 --> 01:22:32,786
What the hell?

851
01:22:32,787 --> 01:22:47,322
What the hell?

852
01:22:47,322 --> 01:24:03,420
- Holy Jesus!
- Look at that.

853
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:04,678
Get some foam on this thing.

854
01:24:04,678 --> 01:24:06,493
- Where are you?
- In the back.

855
01:24:06,493 --> 01:24:08,722
How bad are you hurt?

856
01:24:08,723 --> 01:24:10,139
How the hell do I know?

857
01:24:10,139 --> 01:24:13,604
Get some foam on this thing.
I'm up to my butt in gas.

858
01:24:13,604 --> 01:24:28,730
There's no fracture.

859
01:24:28,731 --> 01:24:32,777
I don't see any other apparent injuries.

860
01:24:32,777 --> 01:24:36,282
It may not be apparent,
but you ought to feel it from my side.

861
01:24:36,282 --> 01:24:38,425
You've been banged up pretty good.

862
01:24:38,425 --> 01:24:40,008
Watch this hammer.

863
01:24:40,008 --> 01:24:42,086
Keep your head still.

864
01:24:42,086 --> 01:24:45,965
I think we’ll keep you here
overnight for observation.

865
01:24:45,965 --> 01:24:47,701
Nurse, where is that head injury?

866
01:24:47,701 --> 01:24:50,959
As they say, you're a lucky man.

867
01:24:50,959 --> 01:24:53,986
- What's with the car?
- Totaled.

868
01:24:53,986 --> 01:24:55,856
You're gonna need new wheels,
that's for sure.

869
01:24:55,857 --> 01:24:57,696
It's time I got rid of it.

870
01:24:57,696 --> 01:24:59,981
If it isn't being wrecked, it's being stolen.

871
01:24:59,981 --> 01:25:03,924
- What is it?
- Nothing.

872
01:25:03,924 --> 01:25:07,397
Stay right here, Lieutenant,
I'll be with you in a minute.

873
01:25:07,397 --> 01:25:08,280
Thank you, Nurse.

874
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:11,777
What do you think, Lon? Santiago?

875
01:25:11,777 --> 01:25:15,354
No. He could have taken me
anytime he wanted.

876
01:25:15,354 --> 01:25:18,763
The whole thing's weird.
Why press you in iron?

877
01:25:18,763 --> 01:25:23,025
It's not so weird if they wanted
to separate me from that car.

878
01:25:23,025 --> 01:25:27,016
- Where is it?
- Impound on Olive.

879
01:25:27,016 --> 01:25:30,457
- Why?
- Just a thought.

880
01:25:30,457 --> 01:25:35,644
Okay, I'll split.

881
01:25:35,644 --> 01:25:37,244
If you need anything, I'll be at home.

882
01:25:37,245 --> 01:25:39,880
- Say hello to Ellen.
- Right.

883
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:46,812
- What's this for?
- You.

884
01:25:46,812 --> 01:25:48,627
No way.

885
01:25:48,628 --> 01:25:52,196
Damn it, Lieutenant. We're busy
around here. I say you get in this chair.

886
01:25:52,196 --> 01:25:55,725
- Hospital regulations.
- And I say it's damn ridiculous.

887
01:25:55,725 --> 01:25:59,079
All right, Lieutenant,
but we’re taking it up with us anyway.

888
01:25:59,079 --> 01:26:07,764
I don't make the regulations.

889
01:26:07,764 --> 01:26:11,237
You could be seriously injured
and not even know it.

890
01:26:11,237 --> 01:26:14,575
- Maybe you're right.
- I've had other cases like you, though.

891
01:26:14,575 --> 01:26:15,904
Just last week I had three.

892
01:26:15,904 --> 01:26:18,572
Two of them were okay,
but one of them was...

893
01:26:18,572 --> 01:26:22,292
Well, for Christ's sake.

894
01:26:22,292 --> 01:26:38,398
Olive and 23rd.

895
01:26:38,398 --> 01:26:52,168
Car 10 to radio.

896
01:26:52,168 --> 01:26:56,550
Notify Capt. Kosterman
the subject just left the hospital.

897
01:26:56,550 --> 01:28:45,517
All right, Lon, come on out.
We know you're in there.

898
01:28:45,517 --> 01:28:59,997
Farrow.

899
01:28:59,997 --> 01:29:01,884
Come over here.

900
01:29:01,884 --> 01:29:08,019
What's going on?

901
01:29:08,019 --> 01:29:09,603
What are you doing here?

902
01:29:09,604 --> 01:29:12,407
I came to meet a friend.

903
01:29:12,407 --> 01:29:14,844
What is going on?

904
01:29:14,844 --> 01:29:16,850
Captain got an anonymous tip.

905
01:29:16,850 --> 01:29:19,192
Lon's had the stolen dope in his car.

906
01:29:19,192 --> 01:29:21,318
He's in there after it now.

907
01:29:21,318 --> 01:29:23,810
- Lon?
- Why not?

908
01:29:23,810 --> 01:29:26,574
Anyone can go bad.

909
01:29:26,574 --> 01:29:30,900
Goodbye, Pinky, you're in the way.

910
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:33,209
Take him over there till I can get to him.

911
01:29:33,209 --> 01:29:40,596
Come on, Lon, we know you're armed.

912
01:29:40,596 --> 01:29:45,671
Now, come out with your hands empty.

913
01:29:45,671 --> 01:29:54,436
Lon, we got a lot of firepower out here.

914
01:29:54,436 --> 01:29:57,200
Don't make me use any heat.

915
01:29:57,200 --> 01:30:06,499
All right, Lon, you coming out?

916
01:30:06,499 --> 01:30:13,622
Let's have the dog.

917
01:30:13,623 --> 01:30:56,931
All right, bring him out.

918
01:30:56,931 --> 01:31:11,387
Son of a bitch!

919
01:31:11,387 --> 01:32:40,962
Lon, What happened?

920
01:32:40,963 --> 01:32:42,953
The police were here looking for you
10 minutes ago.

921
01:32:42,953 --> 01:32:46,498
- Where are you going?
- Down to see my folks.

922
01:32:46,499 --> 01:32:48,449
All right. Get the car out.

923
01:32:48,449 --> 01:32:50,519
Lon, what happened?

924
01:32:50,519 --> 01:32:52,230
Come on, Lois.

925
01:32:52,230 --> 01:33:00,031
All right, Lon. what happened?

926
01:33:00,031 --> 01:33:03,361
Lon, for God's sake.

927
01:33:03,361 --> 01:33:05,734
Stan was dirty.

928
01:33:05,734 --> 01:33:09,191
I don't believe it.

929
01:33:09,191 --> 01:33:11,134
I didn't want to, either.

930
01:33:11,134 --> 01:33:13,714
He was in a frolic, all right...

931
01:33:13,714 --> 01:33:16,956
to steal dope from the Property section...

932
01:33:16,956 --> 01:33:18,373
and sell it off.

933
01:33:18,373 --> 01:33:22,762
The dope had been switched for sugar
long before the heist.

934
01:33:22,762 --> 01:33:25,239
It was stashed in my car.

935
01:33:25,239 --> 01:33:26,927
I was hauling it around.

936
01:33:26,927 --> 01:33:30,623
- What did Stan have to do with that?
- Everything.

937
01:33:30,623 --> 01:33:32,518
I loaned him my car.

938
01:33:32,518 --> 01:33:35,409
He said his was in the shop.

939
01:33:35,409 --> 01:33:36,898
That's the way they got the dope in there.

940
01:33:36,898 --> 01:33:39,207
You really mean it, don't you?

941
01:33:39,207 --> 01:33:40,990
All the way.

942
01:33:40,990 --> 01:33:43,754
I feel kind of silly...

943
01:33:43,754 --> 01:33:48,168
acting like an avenging angel all that time.

944
01:33:48,168 --> 01:33:52,111
I guess he thought a big crop
Would bring me back to him.

945
01:33:52,111 --> 01:33:54,906
I'm glad he's dead.

946
01:33:54,907 --> 01:34:00,476
I'll tell you this, I'm on his side. Why not?

947
01:34:00,476 --> 01:34:04,013
It's the new national sport called grabbing.

948
01:34:04,013 --> 01:34:05,334
Everybody does it.

949
01:34:05,334 --> 01:34:08,496
The senator sells privilege,
the judge takes bribes.

950
01:34:08,496 --> 01:34:10,128
This time it just happened to be Stan.

951
01:34:10,128 --> 01:34:11,624
And some others.

952
01:34:11,624 --> 01:34:13,790
Who?

953
01:34:13,790 --> 01:34:16,267
Somebody tall. Somebody in.

954
01:34:16,267 --> 01:34:19,923
Somebody who killed
Wally Johnson and Stan...

955
01:34:19,923 --> 01:34:21,348
so they could have more for themselves.

956
01:34:21,348 --> 01:34:23,418
Kosterman?

957
01:34:23,418 --> 01:34:28,142
- I'll find out.
- How?

958
01:34:28,143 --> 01:34:31,376
Through you.

959
01:34:31,376 --> 01:34:35,407
I feel kind of silly about that, too.

960
01:34:35,407 --> 01:34:39,964
Lon, you're crazy.

961
01:34:39,964 --> 01:34:43,278
That would be nice.
I'd like it better that way.

962
01:34:43,278 --> 01:34:48,138
No, it started playing back to me, Lois...

963
01:34:48,138 --> 01:34:49,825
When you kept saying:

964
01:34:49,826 --> 01:34:52,629
"Let's get in your Green Hornet
and go someplace."

965
01:34:52,629 --> 01:34:53,783
My car.

966
01:34:53,783 --> 01:34:56,140
And not only once...

967
01:34:56,140 --> 01:34:57,851
at least twice.

968
01:34:57,852 --> 01:35:02,512
You were in it together,
but Stan got double-dealt.

969
01:35:02,512 --> 01:35:05,539
You not only took him off your belly...

970
01:35:05,539 --> 01:35:08,047
you took him out of this World.
You and your new partner.

971
01:35:08,047 --> 01:35:09,121
You are crazy.

972
01:35:09,121 --> 01:35:12,092
We'll see, Lois.
I'm gonna stick with you until...

973
01:35:12,092 --> 01:35:15,350
We find out who comes for this junk.

974
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:17,022
That's right.

975
01:35:17,022 --> 01:35:19,825
Your friend took it out of my car,
gave it to you...

976
01:35:19,826 --> 01:35:21,362
to move it out of the city.

977
01:35:21,362 --> 01:35:24,978
Now, let's see.

978
01:35:24,978 --> 01:35:27,869
Is it in here?

979
01:35:27,869 --> 01:35:41,449
Maybe it's in this one.

980
01:35:41,449 --> 01:35:48,612
Then, it has to be in this one.

981
01:35:48,612 --> 01:35:52,954
Lon, for God's sake,
there are $2 million there.

982
01:35:52,954 --> 01:35:56,387
Lon, you like me.

983
01:35:56,387 --> 01:35:58,346
I like you.

984
01:35:58,346 --> 01:36:01,436
I can go anyplace. We can go together.

985
01:36:01,436 --> 01:36:20,515
That turnoff up there...

986
01:36:20,515 --> 01:36:22,944
take it.

987
01:36:22,944 --> 01:36:47,076
McQ! He's behind the car!

988
01:36:47,076 --> 01:37:42,403
Franklin Toms.

989
01:37:42,403 --> 01:37:45,071
Servant of the people.

990
01:37:45,071 --> 01:38:18,799
Santiago.

991
01:38:18,800 --> 01:41:35,232
Can you hear me?

992
01:41:35,232 --> 01:41:37,852
I want that junk.

993
01:41:37,852 --> 01:41:43,533
McQ, are you listening?

994
01:41:43,533 --> 01:41:46,034
I said, I want that junk!

995
01:41:46,034 --> 01:41:48,534
What's your answer?

996
01:41:48,534 --> 01:42:00,743
McQ, I'll purchase it from you.

997
01:42:00,743 --> 01:42:02,200
25 cents on the dollar.

998
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:08,932
50 cents. Now, that's fair.

999
01:42:08,932 --> 01:42:18,064
Come, now. Let's stop the nonsense...

1000
01:42:18,064 --> 01:42:20,119
shake hands on an agreement.

1001
01:42:20,119 --> 01:42:28,892
If you want it so damn bad,
come and get the stuff.

1002
01:42:28,892 --> 01:42:38,709
Get it.

1003
01:42:38,709 --> 01:42:54,767
Go on.

1004
01:42:54,767 --> 01:44:44,205
Too bad.

1005
01:44:44,205 --> 01:44:49,264
Okay, Lon, I had it wrong...

1006
01:44:49,264 --> 01:44:52,251
but I didn't turn in your badge.

1007
01:44:52,251 --> 01:44:56,608
I could tell you what you can do with it.

1008
01:44:56,609 --> 01:44:58,089
You...

1009
01:44:58,089 --> 01:45:00,263
Lon, it was my job.

1010
01:45:00,263 --> 01:45:02,516
I was transferred to Internal Security.

1011
01:45:02,516 --> 01:45:04,069
I've been on you all the way.

1012
01:45:04,069 --> 01:45:07,303
Yeah, it's your job.

1013
01:45:07,303 --> 01:45:10,688
Lousy damn junk.

1014
01:45:10,688 --> 01:45:14,512
All right, Lon, how about it?

1015
01:45:14,512 --> 01:45:19,021
There's a bar over there.

1016
01:45:19,021 --> 01:45:21,793
Let's get a drink.

1017
01:45:21,793 --> 01:45:26,230
