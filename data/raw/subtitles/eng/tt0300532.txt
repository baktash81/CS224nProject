[Girl]
I wanna be the best surfer
in the world.

[Child Giggles]

4
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:09,526
[Child]
I'm gonna be the best surfer
in the world, not you.

5
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:14,931
[Man]
She's just slotted in there.
Look at that wave.

00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,034
Anne Marie Chadwick getting
the best wave of the day.

Anne Marie...

00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:04,574
[Man's Voice] Hey, howzit,
wave riders. It's hump day,
Wednesday, February 3.

13
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,176
Waves are averaging 14 feet
in 18 seconds.

14
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:11,485
So there's definitely some
size out there in the water,
and it's moving our way.

15
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,583
There's a little bit of morning
sickness out right now,

16
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,855
but it should clean up
as the winds pick up...

17
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,866

00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,255
[Man] It's flat.
Yeah, right.
I'm looking at it.

20
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,951
Anne Marie?
What's up,J.J.?

21
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:49,256
Tell Eden she's a hottie.
Hook me up.

22
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,162
Tell her yourself.
How's Pipe looking?

23
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,929
Ho! It's going off.
It's at least double overhead.

24
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,300
- You better get down here.
- Okay. Thanks, J.J.

25
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:01,534
Pen. Pen, come on.
Get up.

26
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:05,942
Pen. Get up.
It's double overhead.

27
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:09,971
# Could you be loved #

28
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:12,210
# And be loved #
Lena. Hey, Lena.

29
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:15,379
What?
It's double overhead.

30
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:18,947
- What?
- # Could you be loved #

31
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,721
# And be loved #

32
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:25,821
##[Continues]
How's it coming?

33
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:28,924
I can't get the rails right.
They're too pinched.

34
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:32,733
You wanna get wet?
I got to glass before work.

35
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,501
It's perfect Pipe.

36
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,567
For real?
For real.

37
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,375
- Move it.
- Yeah, move it.

38
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,746
- Move. Let's go.
- Let's do it.

39
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,546
Okay, got my noodles.
Let's go.

# Could you be loved #

43
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,936
- Whoo!
- # And be loved #

44
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:10,032
[Lena]
It's going off!

00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:25,280
What's up, bro?

49
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,624
Great.
The Rat Pack's here.

50
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,633
Hey, what's up, guys?

51
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,965
Hey, Rico, what's up?
Hey, girls.

52
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,061
We should have
been here an hour ago.

53
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:42,107
If you would have gotten
moving, we would have been.
We're all right.

54
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,167
What's up, Tamayo?
Hey, how's it, girls?

55
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:49,806
How is it out there?
Oh, it's pretty nuts.
Broke my board.

56
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:55,314
It's pretty heavy out there.
Your girl got her head
on straight this time?

57
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,822
Does she?
You know it.

58
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,759
[Shouting, Whooping]

59
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:25,275
- Oh, look who's here.
- What are you girls doing here?

60
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:29,151
We came to surf Pipe.
Why don't you check out
girlie bowls?

61
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,656
Why don't you crawl back
into the cave you came from?

62
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,591
Why don't I knock you
in the head, drag you
in there with me? Huh?

63
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,754
I like girls that
are rough and soft inside.

64
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,196
I'm gonna have
to marry you, girl.
Let her go.

65
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,257
Seriously, let her go.
We're out of here.
Okay.

66
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,769
What's this I hear about
you surfing the Pipe Masters?

67
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:46,771
It's a surfing contest,
not a drowning contest.

68
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:50,502
Hey, stop hassling my girl.
She's gonna dominate.
Let's see it.

69
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,510
I don't mind girls
that can charge Pipe.

70
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,512
Chick thinks she can
charge Pipe. That's cool.

71
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,878
You think you can
surf it for real?

72
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,112
I dated you, Drew.
I guess I can do anything, huh?

73
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:03,678
I'll get my boys out there.
We'll block every wave you want.

74
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,657
No matter how big it is,
we want you on it.
Let's see what's gonna happen.

75
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:10,958
- Let's do it.
- Don't talk bubbles to me.
Lets see it.

00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,865
##[Rock]

77
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,172
So meet us
at the shower at 7:45?
Okay.

78
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:25,210
And stay on the inside.
Be careful, Pen.
Okay. All right.

79
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,406
[Shouting, Whooping]

80
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,989
[Anne Marie]
Oh. Looks like the reef's
breaking down.

81
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:51,026
Oh, he got shut down.

82
00:07:56,642 --> 00:08:00,100
It's heavy out there.
It's fierce.

83
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:09,050
Ohh.!
[Lena]
Oh, he hit the reef.

84
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,449
That's gotta hurt.

85
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:17,963
I think we should
start at the sandbar
and work our way over.

86
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,021
I won't
argue with that.

87

I want to get a boat so we can
go around the island and get
some killer secret spots.

00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,862
Guaranteed.
There's so many.
Oh, God, I know.

118
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,565
Hey!
What's this horseshit
on the sandbar crap?

119
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,336
You're not gonna
win the Masters
surfing the sandbar.

120
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,242
Talking this crap on the beach.
"I dated you, Drew.
I can do anything."

This isn't Pipe.
Pipe's over there.
Let's go.

The Pipe's over there.
The boys are gonna
block for you.

Let's do this.
Let's go.

louder than words.

Oh, that's the view
I remember.
What, the one of me leaving?

129
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,583
It's my favorite too.

130
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,386
[Drew]
Come on, pick it up.

131
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,930
Like that wave, huh?
Next one's yours.

132
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:28,783
Welcome to the arena, girl.
Let's get you
into something big.

133
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,322
[Man] What's up, Anne Marie?
Where you been?
Thought you were behind us.

134
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,688
Today's your big day.
Let's do it.

135
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,956
[Drew] Hey, everybody,
this is my girl, Anne Marie.
She's with the boys.

136
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:41,261
She's gonna get some waves.
Any of you get in her way,
you're gonna deal with me.

137
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:45,326
Here we go.
Paddle.! Paddle.!
Come on.! Move.!

138
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:48,567
Watch out.! Watch out.!
Spring girl's wave.
Hit it.!

139
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,571
Come on! Paddle in!

140
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,513
- Come on!
- Paddle.! Paddle.! Paddle.!

141
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,486
What the hell is that?

142
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,593
- God.! You ain't even paddling.
- Girls can't surf Pipe.

143
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:16,658
What the hell was that?
What the hell is she afraid of?

144
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,500
[Chattering]

145
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:25,767
- This ain't a beauty pageant.
- Oh, if you do that again,
you're barred.

146
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,609
Come on, Anne Marie,
you got to do it this time.
No fooling around.

147
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,672
Let's do it.

148
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:39,990
This one's yours right here.
Don't blow it. Or I ain't
gonna help you anymore.

149
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,960
Come on. Paddle, paddle.!
This one's yours, Anne Marie.!
Go.! Go.!

150
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,864
[Man]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.!

151
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,598
Ohh!

152
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,580
[Eden] You were in the perfect
spot. You were right where
you needed to be.

153
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,751
[Lena] Whatever.
That thing was a beast.
Just dropped out.

154
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,761
[Penny]
How big was it?

155
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:20,321
[Lena]
It was solid. It was,
like, triple overhead.

156
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,994
She totally had it.
Yeah. She just needed
to paddle a little harder.

157
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,230
[Lena]
I don't know.

158
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,433
[Eden]
It's all in your head.
It's all up here.

159
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:32,944
If you just
would have committed,
you could have made that wave.

160
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,173
Whatever.
At least she went.
That wave was huge.

161
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:38,182
- I would have never gone.
- [Eden]
She was perfectly positioned.

162
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,616
If she had the balls to charge...
[Penny] Why does the sun
rise in the east?

163
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:43,587
What?
Why does the sun
rise in the east?

164
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,783
Because it sets
in the west.

165
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,792
Because that's the way
the Earth rotates.

166
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,488
Do you remember
that Superman episode...

167
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:54,363
where he was, like, spinning
around the Earth backwards...

168
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:57,027
trying to rotate it
in the other direction?

169
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:59,297
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
To bring back time?

170
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:02,238
- I thought you finished.
- I did. I'm just checking it.

171
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,742
- It doesn't look like
you're finished.
- Geez. Stop picking on her.

172
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,710
She's getting it done now.

173
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,942
[Anne Marie]
We're on our way to school.
She should have it done.

174
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:13,644
- She's just checking it.
- I did it last night.
I'm checking it.

175
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,286
[Anne Marie]
Penny.! Penny.!
What?

176
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,918
Flippers.

177
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,985
- No ditching.
- Okay.

178
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:28,158
- It sucks to be you.
- Yeah, it does.

179
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,828
Someone's got to go
to college, honey.
Not me.

180
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,996
Oh, shoot!
It's Mr. Pakui.

181
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,199
[Eden]
Remember how he had
pee stains all the time?

182
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,139
[Lena]
Looks like he learned
how to shake right.

183
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,404
Hi, Mr. Pakui.
Anne Marie,
This is the eighth time...

184
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:41,912
your sister's been tardy
in the last month.

185
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,575
I know. Traffic...
If you think surfing is
more important than school,

186
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,618
we got to make
other arrangements.

187
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:51,349
You know what, Mr. Pakui,
The only other arrangement
I can think of is my mother.

188
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:54,017
And she just so happens to be
with her latest meal ticket
in Vegas...

189
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:57,859
who apparently isn't so cool
with the kid's menu,
you know what I mean?

190
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,364
So right now,
this is the best
arrangement I can do.

191
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:03,299
You know,
Penny's a smart girl.
Yeah, she is.

192
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:06,031
Just like her sister was.

193
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:10,769
Is. Present tense.
I learned that much
while I was here.

194
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,777
You better watch it, girl.

195
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:16,042
I'm doing the best I can do.
That's all I can say.

196
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,583
You can do better.
All right.

197
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,819
God!

198
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:25,687
Like, he's so ripping
in that aloha shirt anyway.
I thought he was hot.

199
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,921
You did kind of peak
in seventh grade.
Shut up, Lena.

200
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:34,557
Sexually, she means.
What is this, like,
bag on Anne Marie?

201
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,624
Whoo!

202
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,966
[Beeping]

203
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,871
Seventeen fifty-three.
That's kama'aina price?

204
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,670
No kama'aina for candy.
Ohh.

205
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,505
Come on, Leilani,
it's breakfast.
Yeah.

206
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:48,978
Breakfast? Right.
Sorry, girls. $17.53.
This has corn syrup in it.

207
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,175
It's a vegetable.
It's nutritional.

208
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,981
No. It has sugar.
It turns into fat. And fat
comes out like me. Okay?

209
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:59,218
So, $17.53.
All right,
I've got five.

210
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,589
- How much do you have?
- I got some cash.

211
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,460
- Hold on, I got, like...
- What is this?

212
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,762
I don't know, like 70, 60...

213
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,893
That's pathetic.
What is that?

214
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,370
I didn't say I had a lot.
I said I had some.

215
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,498
[Anne Marie]
What happened to the five bucks
I gave you yesterday?

216
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,872
I bought food for Sammi.
It's not even our dog.

217
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:19,934
Dog's gotta eat.
So do I. I'm hungry.

218
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,742
- Eat the rest of this Twinkie.
- I don't want it.
I want breakfast.

219
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,875
- Twinkie is breakfast.
- ##[Rap]

220
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:28,943
It's Keala Kennelly.
She's living the life.

221
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:32,184
Must be here for the contest.
Check thosejet skis out.

222
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,725
- So fine.
- All right, let's fill
these bad boys.

223
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:36,624
Let's get on it.
It's gonna be a busy day.

224
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:40,529
She's with her Billabong
sponsor. Introduce yourself.
No.

225
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,760
Why not?
It's not weird.
Because it's weird.

226
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,065
Yes.
No.

227
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,435
- Hi. Can we have
your autograph?
- Yeah, sure.

228
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,098
I'll get you a pen.
Thanks.

229
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,608
Hey, I remember this shot.
[Lena]
What a life.

230
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,907
She gets a grand every time
she's in a magazine.

231
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:55,742
Five grand every time
she's on the cover.

232
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,406
- You surf?
- Yeah.

233
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:01,180
She gets free clothes,
boards, watches, sunglasses.

234
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,653
The girl doesn't have
to open her wallet.

235
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:06,213
[Eden]
You score one good wave
at Pipe Masters...

236
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,225
and you'll get sponsored
just like her.

237
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,261
You'll get flown
all around the world.

238
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,765
Surf Indo, Australia, Tahiti,
you name it.

239
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:17,791
Surf the world, baby.
And you'll get paid to surf
uncrowded, perfect waves.

240
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,430
We'll see you
at the contest.
Okay. Thanks a lot.

241
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:24,767
[Eden]
All you need to do
is get noticed.

242
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:27,243
- Surfer girls.
- Local girls.

243
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:30,110
You know you're
just as good as her.

244
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:33,117
We gotta go to work, guys.
We're gonna be late, again.

our Pro Bowl guests

They are V.I.P. returning guests

Shit.
"A wild card entry.

288
00:19:57,296 --> 00:20:02,825
This North Shore local
first gained notice when she
dominated in thejunior NSSA. "

289
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,493
You dominated.
No.

290
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,505
Wait. You're wearing
my bathing suit bottoms.

291
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:11,065
"She dropped out of
the competitive circuit after
a near-drowning incident."

292
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:14,977
- Yeah, they love
bringing that up, huh?
- That was three years ago.

293
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,982
It's over with.
You're gonna go pro,
and you're gonna win this thing.

Oh, crap!

- Oh, my God.
- [Woman] Hello?
Is somebody in there?

00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,347
Be there...
I'm stuck.

297
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,483
- Put your shoes on.
- Help me, I'm stuck.

298
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,289
- Help me. Ow! Ow!
- Hello? Anyone in there?

299
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,692
- Where's my dress?
- Will you open this door?

300
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,700
- One second.
Be right with you.
- Shoes.

301
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:41,330
- [Knocking]
- Open this door right now.
I'm not fooling around.

302
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,042
- Oh, my shoes.
- Why was this door locked?

00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:51,481
I'm sorry. It gets stuck.
Maintenance will come up
and look at it any second.

304
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,212
- What's going on in here?
- Just cleaning up.

305
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:57,449
We're picking up the clothes.
What happened to all the clothes
that was on the floor?

306
00:20:57,522 --> 00:21:00,150
We fold them up
and put them on the bed.

307
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:03,490
I left the clothes on the floor
so that you would know
they need to be dry-cleaned.

308
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:08,192
That's actually why
we had the dry-cleaning bags
for that specific purpose.

309
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,098
Then why don't you
put them in the bag?

310
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,137
No problem.
That's a cute top.

311
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,299
Like, I need for you guys
to put all of my crusty clothes
inside of the bag.

312
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,502
What about the bags
in her boobs?

313
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:21,569
Her boobs are as big as my head.
And I have one big head.

00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:39,280
- Check it out.
- Who's GQ jock?

480
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,716
Ho ho ho.

481
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:45,612
[Horn Honks]

482
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,818
What was that all about?
I don't know. He wanted
lessons or something.

483
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:51,726
Anne Marie! Lessons?
Money? We're broke?
What?

484
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:55,323
He didn't say
anything about paying.
Well, did you ask?

485
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,836
- You guys going tonight?
No. What time?
- Go, go, go!

486
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,336
- I don't know. I'm kinda lost.
- Go get him.

487
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:06,241
Hey! Hey!
How much?
What? What?

488
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,108
- How much?
- [Honk Honking]
- I got to call you back.

489
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,943
Oh, shit!

490
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,179
Hey! Watch where you're going!

491
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:23,660
Hurry up! Go get him.
Come on.

492
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,822
- Okay, hurry, hurry, hurry.
- Hey. Hey, listen.

493
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,867
- How much?
- I don't know.
What's the going rate?

494
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:35,969
- Twenty bucks an hour.
- Twenty?

495
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,638
Too much?

496
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:44,147
- Fifteen?
- The hotel charges $150.

497
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:46,775
I'll pay that.

498
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,944
Whoa!
One hundred and fifty bucks.

499
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,011
For surf lessons?
That's it, right?

500
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,320
What else
are we talking about?
Got any friends?

501
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:58,055
- Sure I do.
- Whoo! Yeah!

502
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:02,031
##[Radio, Fading]

503
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,706
- What's with the face, Pen?
- What face?

504
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,708
Don't worry, honey.
It's just one afternoon.

505
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,301
You'll have time to get
pregnant and go on welfare.

506
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:16,039
Good idea.
It'll be fun.

507
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,083
- We'll play rip off the tourist.
- We're not ripping anyone off.

508
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:24,144
Anyone who pays
$1,000 a night for a room is
just begging to be ripped off.

509
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:27,680
[Lena] I saw those guys walk
into Tommy Bahama yesterday and
drop four G's on silk boxers.

510
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:30,192
[Anne Marie]
How is that possible?
It's underwear.

511
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:32,923
[Lena]
Those guys got money to burn.
They play in the NFL.

512
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:35,989
[Penny]
I don't care about the money.
Anything is better than this.

513
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,194
[Singing]
Oh, my God!

514
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,737
Yeah, right.
[Penny]
Let me out here, you guys.

515
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,796
Penny!
Who unloaded the mothership?

516
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:44,865
I thought his friends
would be hot at least.

517
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:47,206
[Penny]
This is so embarrassing
to be seen with you.

518
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:50,145
You gonna teach us how to surf?
You gonna teach us how to surf?

519
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:52,341
Guys.

520
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:54,509
Busted.

521
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:57,418
- Come on, it's 150 each.
- [Penny] What if we see
people we know? God.

522
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,513
Whatever.
It's surf lessons.
This is what jocks look like?

523
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,423
- A hundred and fifty bucks.
- Let's go surfing, big daddy.

524
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,893
What's up, girls?

525
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,301
This is Lena and Eden.
I'm Anne Marie.

526
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:14,065
- Hey.
- We gonna surf today?

527
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:16,402
Watch out.
I'll make sure
you drown out there.

528
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:19,500
How's it going? Matt.
Nice to meet you.

529
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:22,705
- This is my
little sister, Penny.
- What's up, little mama?

530
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:26,807
Little surf baby.
You're gonna surf in that?

531
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:30,786
- Hell, no. I'm gonna surf
in my da-da-da-da's.
- In your what?

532
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:34,484
My da-da-da-da's!

533
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:38,051
- Da-da-da-da!
- [Laughing]

534
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:40,393
You're wearing
nut huggers.

535
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:43,797
Some might call them that.
I call them nut containers.
You're gonna teach me to surf.

536
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,393
One, two, three.

537
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,404
Snap up!

538
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:55,001
- No duck butt.
- Oh. Oh, yeah.

Yeah.! Yes.! Get up.!
Get up.! Get up.!

563

Put your head in the center!
Lean forward! Hula hands!

That was so good.

575

That was so good.

576
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:54,128
That was incredible.
Whoa!

577
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:56,428
Are you psyched?
Yeah, totally.

578
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,400
Let's go out and catch
one of those big ones.

579
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:02,633
- Out there?
Well, sure you can handle it?
- Yeah. Definitely.

580
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:12,042
Come on, Matt.
You got it. You got it.
Paddle, paddle, paddle.!

581
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:15,415
Harder. Come on.
You got to dig.

582
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:17,681
All right, Anne Marie,
I'm right there with you.

583
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:21,418
Don't worry about me.
I got this mastered.

584
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:24,393
I am a football player.
Oh, shit.!

585
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:27,022
Ohh!

586
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:32,760
A couple more, you've got it.
Just a couple more waves.

587
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:43,510
Dig.! Turtle.!
Get under your board.!
Turn it over.!

588
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:53,953
- [Gasping]
- Don't give up.
Come on. Paddle.

589
00:39:56,527 --> 00:40:00,019
Got to make it over this wave.
Here we go. Paddle, paddle.
Hey! Hey!

590
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:01,997
Get out of the way.!
Harder!
There you go.

591
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,103
You okay?
Oh, man,
that was intense.

592
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,666
It's getting big out here.
Sure you don't want to go in?

593
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:16,338
No. I mean,
are we safe out here?

594
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:20,077
That depends what you think
is safe, but, yeah, pretty much.
Oh, man.

595
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:27,748
[Matt]
How about this one here?
No, this one's not a wave.

596
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:31,727
Oh, almost.
We'll get you one, Matt,
I promise. Come on back.

597
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:35,061
Oh, man.
Just be patient, Matt.
We'll get you one.

598
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:38,624
Anne Marie,
we're leaving!

599
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:43,264
Hey, sweetie,
why don't you come over here
and help me out a little bit?

600
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,706
Gonna need two of us
to carry this thing.

601
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,677
We should go. It's getting late.
I'm not leaving
until I catch one.

602
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:51,340
- How about this one?
- Turn around, quick. Quick.
Eggbeat. Eggbeat.

603
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,444
There you go, Matt.
This is it.

604
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,546
Paddling. Start paddling.
Go! Paddle! Paddle!

605
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:04,690
Stand up. Stand up.

606
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:10,328
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo! Yeah! Yeah!

607
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,867
There you go.! Yeah.!

608
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,170
- Whoo.!
- Yeah!

609
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:24,913
- Yes!
- There you go.!
Goodjob, Matt.!

610
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,916
- [Yelling]
- Yeah.

611
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,418
- Good job.
- Yes!

612
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:36,554
Hi. Welcome to the Lanakai.
That's all right.
I'm just dropping him off.

613
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:39,494
Why don't you come in
for a drink?
[Laughs]

614
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:43,897
Um, yeah. No, I'd
love to, but l, um...
But what?

615
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,768
I have to get back
to my side of the island.
You know what I mean?

616
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:52,434
Uh, no. Why?
'Cause I'm in training.

617
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,911
Pipe, uh, line.
Pipeline.

618
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,244
Master. Pipe Masters.
Right.
Pipe Masters. Right.

619
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:03,648
[Sighs]
Well, uh,
I tell you what. Uh...

620
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,816
I've only got 40 bucks.
For what?

621
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:10,327
For you.
For the lesson.

622
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:12,589
Oh, right.
But if you want
to come up to my room,

623
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:15,655
I'll give you the rest of it,
the money.

624
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:22,405
l-I would
really like to do that,
but see those guys over there?

625
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:23,997
They see us
heading up to your room,

626
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:26,668
half the island's gonna have us
sleeping together by tomorrow.

627
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,678
Really?
It's the coconut wireless.

628
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:31,237
That's very serious.
It's great. Yeah.

629
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:34,842
In that case, you wait here,
I'll come right back
with your money.

630
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:36,910
All right. Well, wait.

631
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:42,488
I'll come up.
You sure?

632
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,051
Okay. I don't want to ruin
your reputation or anything.

633
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:47,188
Thanks.
I'll worry about that.

634
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:51,132
All right.
Okay. You go up the elevator,

1116
01:14:57,092 --> 01:15:00,084
here at Banzai Pipeline
on the North Shore of Oahu.

1117
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,824
You're gonna be watching
women's surfng history today...

1118
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:06,163
as these girls take on
the deadliest waves
in the world.

1119
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:10,137
Imagine the Niagara Falls
dumping into two feet of water
over hard-rock lava...

1120
01:15:10,205 --> 01:15:12,765
with razor-sharp reef
and underwater caves.

1121
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:15,469
[Man On Radio]
It's gonna be a macking 20 feet.

1122
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:19,640
Good luck to all the ladies
competing today
at the Pipe Masters.

1123
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:23,344
They may be the best in
the world, but they're gonna
have their hands full today.

1124
01:15:23,418 --> 01:15:26,387
If you're going down to watch,
it's not a day for a dip
in the water.

1125
01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:30,084
Anne Marie,
you all right?
Mm-hmm.

1126
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:32,490
[Tires Screech]

1127
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:35,257
You guys get out here.
I'll go find
some parking.

1128
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:37,662
[Man On P.A.]
Pretty much an impossible
score at this point.

1129
01:15:37,733 --> 01:15:41,191
She's way behind,
but she's still gonna try
and put it on the line.

1130
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:45,707
Looks like she's
goin'for this one.
Oh.! She broke her board.

1131
01:15:45,774 --> 01:15:49,608
Any day at Pipeline,
it's critical, but today,

1132
01:15:49,678 --> 01:15:53,910
one false move
and the consequences
could be disastrous.

1133
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:58,612
More surfers have died here
than any other spot
on the planet combined.

1134
01:15:58,687 --> 01:16:01,884
This is the first time
the girls have gotten
to compete at Pipeline.

1135
01:16:01,957 --> 01:16:04,721
The entire surfcommunity
is here today...

1136
01:16:04,793 --> 01:16:09,594
every sponsor, talent scout,
the entire surf media... looking
to find the next surfsensation.

1137
01:16:09,665 --> 01:16:13,863
Get one good ride here today,
and you'll put yourself
on the surfng map.

1138
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:15,927
Out there all by herself
is Lynette MacKenzie,

1139
01:16:16,004 --> 01:16:18,165
now that Megan's
on the beach
with a broken board.

1140
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,640
She's in on a nice one.
She's comin'in.

1141
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:25,009
[Announcer Continues,
Indistinct]

1142
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:27,947
You really have to commit
if you are gonna
get those waves.

1143
01:16:28,016 --> 01:16:31,713
But I'm sure
it'll better the score
she already has.

1144
01:16:31,787 --> 01:16:34,017
Good luck, Layne.
Thanks.
I could use it.

1145
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:36,683
I'm here
for the competition.
Are you a volunteer?

1146
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:39,022
She's a competitor.
You need to sign
this release form.

or dismemberment"?

1149
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:49,462
Thank you.
You'll be in heat four
with Kate Skarratt.

1150
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:51,529
You can go ahead and wait
in the competitors' area.

1151
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:54,405
Thank you.
Good luck.

1152
01:16:54,476 --> 01:16:56,467
It's looking pretty solid
out there, isn't it?

1153
01:16:56,545 --> 01:17:00,242
[Laughing, Chattering]

1154
01:17:00,315 --> 01:17:03,250
Oh, my gosh.

1155
01:17:03,318 --> 01:17:06,378
There's Kate Skarratt.
She kills at Pipe.

1156
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:09,583
And there's Rochelle Ballard.
She's queen ofback door.

1157
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:12,889
- Oh, my gosh.!
Layne Beachley is...
- I know who they are.

1158
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:14,895
What? I'm...
You're good.

1159
01:17:14,963 --> 01:17:17,454
I'm just saying...
they're...
they're really good.

[Car Alarm Blaring]

1161
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:24,696
Shit.!

1162
01:17:24,773 --> 01:17:28,334
[Man]
Come on. Let's go.
[Tires Screech, Horn Honks]

1163
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:32,039
Hey! What's up, man?
[Man]
What's up?

1164
01:17:32,114 --> 01:17:36,813
Where's parking around here?
Anywhere, I guess
Whatever you can find.

1165
01:17:36,885 --> 01:17:39,149
[Announcer]
Looks like she's
goin'on this one.

1166

[Announcer Continues,

1167
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,585
Hey. Hey, Anne Marie.
Look what I found.

1168

[Announcer]
Next heat, Keala Kennelly.
Hey. Just driving by.

1169
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:53,635
What's up,
surfer girl?

1170
01:17:53,702 --> 01:17:56,136
- Do the damn thing.
- [Both Laughing]

1171
01:17:56,204 --> 01:17:59,640
- Shit.
- [Announcer]
Twenty-foot swell on the rise.

1172
01:18:01,209 --> 01:18:03,302
[Anne Marie]
Pretty weird out there.

1173
01:18:03,378 --> 01:18:07,678
It's a super-clean,
west-northwest swell.

1174
01:18:07,749 --> 01:18:10,843
Pipe and back door
are both open.

1175
01:18:10,919 --> 01:18:13,820
[Lena]
Yeah. Just be patient.
Don't get too anxious.

1176
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:17,825
It's four-wave sets
with 20-second intervals.
Take your time.

1177
01:18:17,893 --> 01:18:20,657
[Penny]
Don't take the first wave
of the set.

1178
01:18:20,729 --> 01:18:22,492
Third wave
looks the best.

1179
01:18:22,564 --> 01:18:26,432
[Announcer]
Here comes Kennelly
taking off. Steep drop.

1180
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:29,026
She makes the bottom turn.
She's fierce, man.

1181
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:31,504
Gets covered up.

1182
01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:35,707
Oh.! She makes it out.

1183
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:38,940
Let's give her a warm
round of applause.
I'm way out of my league.

1184

Hey. No worries.

1185
01:18:41,917 --> 01:18:45,978
Just go out there
and have fun.
[Laughs] "Fun."

1186
01:18:49,357 --> 01:18:53,123
[Announcer] Up next,
from Australia, we have
Kate Skarratt in red.

1187
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:56,164
[Sighs]
She's a goofy foot, which
favors her at Pipeline.

1188
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:59,462
Loves charging big waves
and has taken first place
at Teahupoo,

1189
01:18:59,534 --> 01:19:02,094
another barreling
left-hander in Tahiti.

1190
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:05,606
Surfng against her,
we have wild card entry,
Anne Marie Chadwick,

01:19:05,674 --> 01:19:09,440
a formerJunior NSSA champion
who dropped out of
the competitive circuit...

1192
01:19:09,511 --> 01:19:14,471
after a near-drowning incident
at this very spot
just three years ago.

1193
01:19:14,549 --> 01:19:19,043

two, one.

01:19:55,257 --> 01:19:58,454
We've got 20-minute heats
today with the top
four waves scoring.

1198
01:19:58,527 --> 01:20:01,052
Wave selection is critical.

1199
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:03,962
If you pick the wrong wave,
wipe out, get caught inside...

1200
01:20:04,032 --> 01:20:08,196
You could spend the rest
of your heatjust trying
to get back to the lineup.

1201
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:10,261
How's it goin'?
Good.

1202
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:13,705
Nice set approaching.
Got good sets out the back.

1203
01:20:13,775 --> 01:20:17,176
We have really good
consistency with swell.
It's on the rise.

1204
01:20:17,245 --> 01:20:19,645
Probably gonna get up
to about 15 to 20 feet.

1205
01:20:19,714 --> 01:20:23,707
Kate Skarratt's goin'
on this one. She's paddling,
gets to her feet.

1206
01:20:23,785 --> 01:20:26,777
Makes the drop.
Solid bottom turn.

Look at that pit.!

racing to make it out.

Trying to get
to the shoulder.

1210
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:42,065
Traveling...
Oh.! She didn't quite
get around that last turn.

1211
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:46,504
She'll get some kind
of score for it.

1212
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:50,511
Looks like it's a 4. 1
that came in on the board.

1213
01:20:50,579 --> 01:20:53,514
Water patrol's
checking on her.
Looks like she's okay.

1214
01:20:53,582 --> 01:20:57,143
If she doesn't need a ride,
she can paddle back out.

1215
01:20:57,219 --> 01:21:01,656
So Chadwick all alone
by herself out there,
yet to even score a ride.

1216
01:21:04,025 --> 01:21:06,323
Go, go! Paddle!
Headed for her first ride.

- Beautiful wave. She's not
gonna get any more like that.
- What a waste of wave.

1220
01:21:24,112 --> 01:21:26,444
She should've gone.
That would have opened up
perfectly.

1221
01:21:26,514 --> 01:21:28,505
Shit!

1222
01:21:28,583 --> 01:21:33,020
When you're out there all alone,
you can psyche yourself out.
You can do it, girl.

1223
01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:35,181
- Chadwick will have to wait
for the next set.
- What are you doin'?

1224
01:21:35,257 --> 01:21:38,385
Kate Skarratt's paddling
into one of the best
waves of the day.

1225
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:41,861
0h.! Look at this wave.
It is a bomb.

1226
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:46,629

She's a little overextended
and goes down.

Okay, everybody, as the ski
comes up on the beach,
please give them some room.

1233
01:22:22,737 --> 01:22:24,728
The water patrol
needs some space to work.

1234
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:28,333
Skate Skarratt has gone
down on that last wave.

1235

They're carrying
the backboard down.
This isn't good.

01:26:25,813 --> 01:26:28,577
[Announcer Continues,
Indistinct]
[Neck Cracks]

1272
01:26:30,718 --> 01:26:33,744
I'm gonna put
some ice on it.

1273
01:26:33,821 --> 01:26:35,812
Lift your head.

1274
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,951
Just lay there
and relax for a minute.

1275
01:26:46,267 --> 01:26:48,258
Hey.

1276
01:26:48,336 --> 01:26:51,828
If you tell me to be the girl
on the beach right now,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

1277
01:26:51,906 --> 01:26:54,136
[Laughing]
Oh.

1278
01:26:56,177 --> 01:26:59,044
So how are you feelin'?
I've been better.

1279
01:26:59,113 --> 01:27:01,980
Yeah.

1280
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:06,145
My, uh,
my first NFL game,

1281
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:09,486
I got blindsided
by Warren Sapp.

1282
01:27:09,557 --> 01:27:12,048
I tell you,
I've never been hit
so hard in my life.

1283
01:27:12,126 --> 01:27:16,495
I lay there praying something
was broken so I wouldn't have
to get up and finish the game.

1284
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:21,160
You think I'm faking?
No. I know
you got rocked out there.

1285
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:24,637
Just like I did.
But Leslie sat me down,

1286
01:27:24,706 --> 01:27:29,439
said that was the hardest
I'd ever be hit and that I would
regret not going back in.

1287
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:32,308
So l... I went back in.

1288
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:34,814
And you won the game.

1289
01:27:34,882 --> 01:27:37,248
No. Actually, we lost.

1290
01:27:37,318 --> 01:27:41,550
[Laughing]
And I got my ass kicked.

1291
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:46,757
But there's this one
beautiful pass...

1292
01:27:46,828 --> 01:27:51,231
one perfect spiral
right into Omar's fingertips...

1293
01:27:51,299 --> 01:27:53,358
and a touchdown.

1294
01:27:55,837 --> 01:27:59,364
[Sighs]
Look, I can't talk you
into goin'back out there.

1295
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,738
It's... It seems crazy.

1296
01:28:04,078 --> 01:28:09,038
But I know how good you are,
and I know how much
this means to you.

1297
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:13,213
I just don't want you
to spend your life wondering
what could have been.

1298
01:28:20,828 --> 01:28:23,524
[Announcer]
Heads up on the beach, people.
Big set approaching.

1299
01:28:23,598 --> 01:28:26,192
Hey, everybody, we have
a set out the back.

1300
01:28:26,267 --> 01:28:28,701
Watch your kids.
Watch your belongings.

1301
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:31,864
The water is coming
over the berm.
It's dangerous out there.

1302
01:28:31,939 --> 01:28:34,703
The water patrol already
has their hands full,

1303
01:28:34,776 --> 01:28:37,244
so we'd appreciate it
if you'djust back up.

1304
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:40,110
Here today we have
a rising swell,

1305
01:28:40,181 --> 01:28:43,241
so I wanna give
a little word of warning
to everybody to watch out.

1306
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:46,253
Guys, look, this is really
not a good time.
Can I get a picture?

1307
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:48,755
What?
Can we get a picture?
We're working these chicks here.

1308
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:51,291
They think you're some kind
of great hockey player
or something.

1309
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:55,955
You're kidding.
No joke. We wanna
get this thing done.

1310
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:59,557
Sorry my pits stink.
That's just the way it goes.
Let's go. Right here.

1311
01:28:59,634 --> 01:29:01,829
Smile.
You're on vacation.
This way, this way.

1312
01:29:01,903 --> 01:29:04,235
Fluff your bangs
a little bit.
A little more attitude.

1313
01:29:04,305 --> 01:29:07,069
Beautiful.
One more.
All right, great.

1314
01:29:07,141 --> 01:29:09,132
Hey.
Hey.

1315
01:29:09,210 --> 01:29:11,508
You goin'
back out there?
Yup.

1316
01:29:11,579 --> 01:29:13,774
It's just a stupid contest.
It's not worth
getting hurt over.

1317
01:29:13,848 --> 01:29:15,839
I'll be fine.
Hey.

1318
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:19,751
- What?
- Be careful.

1319
01:29:19,821 --> 01:29:22,483
[Laughing]
Yeah.

1320
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:26,255
- [Blasts]
- [Announcer] That sounds
the start of the next heat.

1321
01:29:26,327 --> 01:29:29,421
Chadwick's pretty much
got her hands full
this next round.

1322
01:29:29,497 --> 01:29:31,988
Keala Kennelly from Hawaii.
She's a charger.

1323
01:29:32,066 --> 01:29:35,058
She'll go on anything.
She goes like a man out here.

1324
01:29:41,843 --> 01:29:43,708
Bit of a paddle battle
going on out there.

1325
01:29:43,778 --> 01:29:47,305
Looks like Chadwick
and Kennelly are
paddling for the peak.

1326
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:49,441
Chadwick's got
the inside position.

1327
01:29:49,517 --> 01:29:52,008
- Lf a big set approaches,
she's gonna get the first wave.
- Come on, come on.

1328
01:29:52,086 --> 01:29:54,554
This paddle battle
is really about who's
gonna get the first wave.

1329
01:29:54,622 --> 01:29:57,386
Chadwick in position,
heading for the first wave.

1330
01:29:57,458 --> 01:29:59,449
Starts to paddle.
She's goin'for it.

1331
01:30:01,462 --> 01:30:06,058
Oh.! She... She pulls back.
Kennelly's wide open.
She catches a wave.

1332
01:30:07,135 --> 01:30:08,329
[Sighs]

1333
01:30:11,038 --> 01:30:13,563
Time and time again,
man.

1334
01:30:31,392 --> 01:30:34,225
She's out,
making it look so easy.

1335
01:30:34,295 --> 01:30:36,991
But, folks,
it's not easy out there.

1336
01:30:37,064 --> 01:30:41,091
Chadwick starts to paddle.
She paddles for it.

1337
01:30:41,169 --> 01:30:43,160
Doesn't quite get it.

1338
01:30:45,673 --> 01:30:47,607
[All Groan]
What a waste of wave.

1339
01:30:51,179 --> 01:30:55,445
[Announcer]
That's gotta hurt when
you know you need a score,

1340
01:30:55,516 --> 01:30:58,679
and you're going up against
one of the best surfers
in this event,

1341
01:30:58,753 --> 01:31:01,119
and you don't go.

1342
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:04,181
Plenty of time being
allowed here for Kennelly
to get back in position,

1343
01:31:04,258 --> 01:31:06,886
and she's paddled
right inside of Chadwick,

1344
01:31:06,961 --> 01:31:08,952
and she's looking
to catch her next wave.

1345
01:31:30,184 --> 01:31:32,812
Keala Kennelly.
Hands together,
ladies and gentlemen.

1346
01:31:32,887 --> 01:31:35,651
Keala Kennelly.
A great two-ride out here
at the Pipeline.

1347
01:31:35,723 --> 01:31:39,921
[Crowd Cheering]
Keala's got sack.
She goes like the men out here.

1348
01:31:39,994 --> 01:31:43,259
For some reason, Chadwick
has yet to even ride a wave.
I don't know what's going on.

1349
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:46,892
I don't know if she's just
psyching herself out or if
Keala's putting it to her.

1350
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:55,773
What are you doin'?
What?

1351
01:31:55,843 --> 01:31:57,674
You gonna take a wave
or just sit there
like a buoy?

1352
01:31:57,745 --> 01:32:01,943
Look, you're never gonna
catch a wave sitting
all the way over here.

1353
01:32:02,016 --> 01:32:06,646
Follow me. I'll get you
into one. Give the crowd
something to cheer about.

1354
01:32:06,721 --> 01:32:08,746
Let's get you a wave.
Come on.

1355
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:14,621
Follow me into the lineup,
and I'm gonna tell you
to go on a wave.

1356
01:32:14,695 --> 01:32:16,754
And when I tell you to go,
you gotta go.

1357
01:32:16,831 --> 01:32:19,959
Paddle your little heart out.
You can't hesitate.
You can't pull back.

1358
01:32:20,034 --> 01:32:22,332
You can't hold back.
No fear, all right?

1359
01:32:22,403 --> 01:32:25,497
'Cause if you hold back
for a second,
you're gonna eat shit.

1360
01:32:25,573 --> 01:32:27,564
Come on. Follow me.

1361
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:35,671
[Announcer]
It looks like the next set's
approaching.

1362
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:38,947
This is the one. Go.

1363
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:42,114
Paddle! Paddle!
Go, girl!
Paddle! Paddle!

1364
01:32:42,189 --> 01:32:44,714
Paddle.!

1365
01:32:44,792 --> 01:32:46,692
Ah!

1366
01:32:46,761 --> 01:32:48,752
Go.!

1367
01:32:51,866 --> 01:32:53,458
Oh!

1368
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:06,240
[Crowd Groans]

1369
01:33:31,739 --> 01:33:35,106
[Man]
You all right?
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1370
01:33:35,176 --> 01:33:37,508
Get back out there then.

1371
01:33:41,782 --> 01:33:44,842
- [Blasts]
- [Announcer] With only
two minutes left in her heat,

1372
01:33:44,919 --> 01:33:46,944
Chadwick struggles
to get back into the lineup...

1373
01:33:47,021 --> 01:33:49,854
so she can catch
a scoring wave.

1374
01:33:49,924 --> 01:33:52,893
Chadwick has yet to even
score a good ride,
a scoring ride.

1375
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:57,021
She needs to redeem herself.
Keala is absolutely
dominating this heat,

1376
01:33:57,098 --> 01:33:59,293
and Chadwick needs to put
a scoring ride on the board.

1377
01:34:07,141 --> 01:34:09,006
[Gasping]

1378
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:14,046
Ouch.
Are you all right?

1379
01:34:14,115 --> 01:34:16,583
That was nasty.
It's okay.
I want another one.

1380
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:18,949
- You want another one?
That's the spirit.
- Yup.

1381
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:20,749
Shake off that last wave,
and let's do this.

1382
01:34:20,821 --> 01:34:23,619
Less than 20 seconds left.
Feel that adrenaline.
Use it. Come on.

1383
01:34:23,691 --> 01:34:26,421
Anne Marie Chadwick
only has one more chance.

1384
01:34:28,629 --> 01:34:32,258
On the outside. Here comes
one of the best sets
of the whole day.

1385
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:34,995
We have lines
stacked to the horizon.

1386
01:34:41,409 --> 01:34:44,310
[Kennelly]
Here comes a set.
This is the one.

1387
01:34:44,378 --> 01:34:47,836
All right, come on.
Go.! Go, go.!

1388
01:34:47,915 --> 01:34:50,281
[Crowd Cheering]
[Woman]
Go, girl.!

1389
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:53,013
- [Announcer]
Chadwick's out there.
- Paddle hard!

1390
01:34:53,087 --> 01:34:55,351
- Go! Go! Go!
- [Crowd Cheering]

1391
01:34:55,423 --> 01:34:57,653
[Kennelly]
This is yours.!
Don't pull back.!

1392
01:34:57,725 --> 01:35:00,660
- Go, go!
- [Kennelly]
Go.! Go.! Go.!

1393
01:35:11,939 --> 01:35:13,497
Oh, my gosh!

1394
01:35:30,858 --> 01:35:32,052
[Laughing]

1395
01:35:37,064 --> 01:35:40,192
Oh, my gosh!

1396
01:35:55,483 --> 01:35:58,043
[Crowd Cheering]
Oh, shit! Yeah!

1397
01:35:59,587 --> 01:36:01,578
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

1398
01:36:02,723 --> 01:36:05,214
- Whoo!
- Oh, she makes it.!

1399
01:36:05,292 --> 01:36:07,590
[All Cheering]
That's my bitch!

1400
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:18,364
[Cheering Continues]

1401
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:21,840
Yeah!
That was insane!

1402
01:36:27,515 --> 01:36:30,109
- Whoo!
- Waiting for
thejudges'scores.

1403
01:36:30,184 --> 01:36:34,120
They're coming in.
Looks like unanimous tens
across the board,

1404
01:36:34,188 --> 01:36:36,884
but not enough
to overtake Kennelly
and move into the next round.

1405
01:36:36,957 --> 01:36:42,486
- But she is a hero
with the crowd here today.
- That's my sister! Whoo!

1406
01:36:42,563 --> 01:36:44,190
That's my sister!
[Laughing]

1407
01:36:44,765 --> 01:36:46,289
Just words
don't explain it.

1408
01:36:46,367 --> 01:36:49,530
For Anne Marie Chadwick
to get a ride like that...

1409
01:36:49,603 --> 01:36:52,800
with the entire North Shore
surfng community watching...
[All Whooping]

1410
01:36:59,413 --> 01:37:01,574
That was insane!

1411
01:37:01,649 --> 01:37:05,449
# My face to the sky
dreamin'aboutjust how high #
We're so proud of her.

1412
01:37:05,519 --> 01:37:10,252
# I could go, and I'll know
when I finally get there #

1413
01:37:10,324 --> 01:37:13,816
Can I have your autograph?
Can I have your autograph?

1414
01:37:13,894 --> 01:37:16,829
I taught her
everything she knows.

1415
01:37:16,897 --> 01:37:18,956
# There's a time #
[Girl]
That's our girl.

1416
01:37:19,033 --> 01:37:21,331
# For every star to shine #
Hey.

1417
01:37:21,402 --> 01:37:25,338
That was awesome.
Thank you.

1418
01:37:25,406 --> 01:37:29,934
Hey, you should, uh,
check out the board.
Boards By Eden.

1419
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:32,478
[Woman]
Hey, Anne Marie. Excuse me.
Hi.

1420
01:37:32,546 --> 01:37:35,071
I'm Jessica from Billabong.
I'd love to talk to you
about being on our team.

1421
01:37:35,149 --> 01:37:37,413
- Wait your turn, honey.
- Okay.

1422
01:37:37,484 --> 01:37:42,012
- Does she know
she got beat?
- Nice, isn't it?

1423
01:37:42,089 --> 01:37:46,150
Hey.
Yeah!
[Laughing]

1424
01:37:46,227 --> 01:37:48,661
Whoo!
[Screeching]

1425
01:37:48,729 --> 01:37:51,926
You did the damn thing,
girl.
Thanks. Hey.

1426
01:37:51,999 --> 01:37:54,092
